  ABOUT THE SECURITY OF U.S. CITIZENS OVERSEAS. U.S. CITIZENS ARE 
  CAUTIONED TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF VIGILANCE, TO REMAIN 
  ALERT AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO INCREASE THEIR SECURITY 
  AWARENESS. THERE ARE INCREASING INDICATIONS THAT AL-QAIDA IS 
  PREPARING TO STRIKE U.S. INTERESTS ABROAD. IT IS EXPECTED THAT

  EXERCISE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS.  IF YOU MUST WALK ALONE AT 
  NIGHT, KEEP TO POPULOUS AND WELL-LIT AREAS.  PAY ATTENTION TO 
  YOUR WALLET, PURSE, HANDBAG AND CELLULAR TELEPHONE, AS ALL ARE 
  POPULAR TARGETS OF THE LOCAL THIEVES.  THE LOCAL PICKPOCKETS 
  ARE PROFESSIONAL AND MOST ACTIVE DURING THE SUMMER.  THEY TEND 
  TO UTILIZE DISTRACTION TECHNIQUES TO CONFUSE THEIR TARGET, 
  PREFERRING LOCATIONS SUCH AS SHOPPING CENTERS, MARKETS AND 
  PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN THE VICINITY OF THE +ACI-OLD TOWN+ACI-, NEAR 
  MAJOR HOTELS WHERE FOREIGNERS STAY AND TOURIST SITES, AND THE 
  NIGHT TRAINS TO PRAGUE AND WARSAW. POWER STRUGGLES WITHIN THE 
  ORGANIZED CRIME, WHICH CAN BE VIOLENT, OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME. 
  THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT/NOT DIRECTED AGAINST AMERICANS OR OTHER 
  FOREIGNERS.  THE RATE OF AUTO THEFT, WHICH IS ALSO CONNECTED TO 
  ORGANIZED CRIME, IS VERY HIGH IN BRATISLAVA.  UP-MARKET 
  EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN CARS ARE PREFERRED TARGETS.  THE USE OF 
  ALARM SYSTEMS OR ANTI-THEFT DEVICES IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.

SUBJECT:  SLOVAKIA: HOLOCAUST EDUCATION MANDATORY BUT NEEDS 
IMPROVEMENT 
 
REF:  SECSTATE 348370 
 
1.  IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL QUESTIONS CONCERNING HOLOCAUST 
EDUCATION IN SLOVAKIA, POST OFFERS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION 
DRAWN FROM THE AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE 1998 REPORT ON \"THE 
TREATMENT OF JEWISH THEMES IN SLOVAK SCHOOLS\" AND FROM DISCUSSION 
    IN EARLY JANUARY 2004 WITH MRS. MARIA SLUGENOVA AT THE MINISTRY 
OF EDUCATION AND MR. EGON GAL, DIRECTOR OF THE JEWISH STUDIES 
PROGRAM AT COMENIUS UNIVERSITY.  BOTH INDIVIDUALS ARE MEMBERS OF 
SLOVAKIA\'S COMMITTEE THAT COORDINATES WITH THE TASK FORCE FOR 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN HOLOCAUST EDUCATION, REMEMBRANCE AND 
RESEARCH.  IN BRIEF, SLOVAKIA HAS EDUCATION LEADERS ACTIVELY 
ENGAGED IN TRYING TO IMPROVE HOLOCAUST EDUCATION; HOWEVER, THERE 
IS STILL SOME WAY TO GO AS THE TOPIC DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL 
CURRICULUM OR IN-DEPTH TEXTS. 
 
2.  IS THERE A NATIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR TEACHING THE HOLOCAUST? 
 
A:  YES.  SLOVAKIA HAS A NATIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEM AND 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST IS INCLUDED IN SOME REQUIRED 
TEXTBOOKS FOR ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.  REQUIRED 
TEXTS TOUCHING ON JEWISH HISTORY AND THE HOLOCAUST INCLUDE 
HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY BOOKS, AS WELL AS CIVIC EDUCATION.  SOME 
NEWLY-PUBLISHED REQUIRED TEXTS AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL ARE CANDID 
ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE WARTIME SLOVAK STATE IN THE PERSECUTION AND 
DEPORTATION TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS OF MANY THOUSANDS OF SLOVAK 
JEWS.  SECONDARY SCHOOL BOOKS, STILL IN USE UNTIL A NEWLY- 
PREPARED HIGH SCHOOL BOOK REACHES THE PRESS, PRESENT THE WARTIME 
SLOVAK STATE POSITIVELY, COVERING UP COMPLICITY WITH THE 
HOLOCAUST, IN LINE WITH NATIONALIST TRENDS IN POLITICS.  BOTH THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME MINISTER ARE SUPPORTIVE OF HOLOCAUST 
EDUCATION AS A NATIONAL REQUIREMENT, AND REFORM OF BOOKS AS WELL 
AS TEACHER TRAINING ARE ONGOING.  SEPTEMBER 9 IS RECOGNIZED IN 
SLOVAKIA AS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR THE HOLOCAUST.  SCHOOLS 
ORGANIZE DISCUSSIONS AND TEACHERS AND STUDENTS VISIT MEMORIAL 
SITES IN THEIR REGIONS.  THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE, POLITICAL 
PARTIES, THE JEWISH MUSEUM, SOME NGOS AND OTHERS ALSO ORGANIZE 
    EVENTS. 
 
3.  ARE THERE STATE OR MUNICIPAL REQUIREMENTS OR GUIDELINES FOR 
TEACHING THE HOLOCAUST? 
 
A:  AS THE CURRICULUM IS NATIONAL, THE APPROACH IS NATIONAL FOR 
THIS COUNTRY WITH A TOTAL POPULATION OF AROUND FIVE MILLION.  THE 
COUNTRY\'S FOUR TEACHERS\' TRAINING COLLEGES IN KOSICE, PRESOV, 
BANSKA BYSTRICA AND BRATISLAVA THAT COORDINATE IN-SERVICE AS WELL 
AS PRE-SERVICE TRAINING DO INCLUDE VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS ON 
HOLOCAUST TRAINING THAT ARE WELL ATTENDED.   TRAINERS DESCRIBE 
THE TEACHERS AS MOTIVATED AND OPEN-MINDED CONCERNING HOLOCAUST 
HISTORY.  TRAINING OF TRAINERS IS ONGOING IN SLOVAKIA AND ABOUT 
FIFTY TEACHER TRAINERS ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN THE FIELD.  THEIR 
TRAINING HAS INCLUDED SITE VISITS TO FORMER CONCENTRATION CAMPS. 
 
4.  WHAT CURRICULA HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR HOLOCAUST EDUCATION? 
 
A:  THERE IS NO SPECIFIC CURRICULUM FOR HOLOCAUST EDUCATION; 
HOWEVER AN EDUCATION PACKET IS IN PREPARATION (SEE BELOW). 
 
5.  HOW ARE THE TEXT MATERIALS ON THE HOLOCAUST BEING USED IN 
SCHOOLS? 
 
A:  CURRENT TEXTS ON THE HOLOCAUST ARE INSUFFICIENT AND TEACHERS 
ARE WAITING FOR THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY TEXTBOOK.  OF SPECIAL 
INTEREST, A HOLOCAUST EDUCATION PACKET FOR TEACHERS PREPARED BY 
HISTORIANS, SPECIALISTS AND TEACHERS IS THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC 
MATERIAL THAT TEACHERS WILL RECEIVE DEALING WITH HOLOCAUST 
EDUCATION FOR SLOVAKIA.  THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION IN COOPERATION 
WITH THE INSTITUTE OF JEWISH STUDIES HAS COMPLETED PREPARATION OF 
    THE PACKET AND ONE THOUSAND COPIES WILL BE DISTRIBUTED IN THE 
SPRING.  THE PACKAGE WILL BE USED AS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL BY 
HISTORY TEACHERS.  IT INCLUDES \"GUIDELINES FOR TEACHING ABOUT THE 
HOLOCAUST,\" AS WELL AS \"ROOTS, CONDITIONS AND THE COURSE OF THE 
HOLOCAUST IN EUROPE AND SLOVAKIA\".  IT ALSO INCLUDES BACKGROUND 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE JEWISH PEOPLE.  THE PACKAGE HAS A VIDEOTAPE 
OF AUTHENTIC TESTIMONY OF SLOVAK SURVIVORS AND A THEMATIC 
WORKBOOK.  AT PRESENT, USE OF SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS AND CORRECT 
USE OF REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS LEAVES HOLOCAUST EDUCATION IN LARGE 
PART TO THE TEACHERS\' DISCRETION.  OUR CONTACTS DO REPORT THAT 
MANY TEACHERS ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN HOLOCAUST EDUCATION AT 
PRESENT.

SUBJECT: THEMES FOR THE VISIT OF SLOVAK MFA STATE SECRETARY 
IVAN KORCOK 
 
REF: A. A. 03 BRATISLAVA 1375 
 
     B. B. 03 BRATISLAVA 1388 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CDA SCOTT N THAYER FOR REASON 1.4B. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: STATE SECRETARY FOR THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF 
    FOREIGN AFFAIRS IVAN KORCOK (PRONOUNCED KOR-CHOK) WILL VISIT 
WASHINGTON JANUARY 14-16 TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE SLOVAKIA 
PLACES ON THE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP AND TO INTENSIFY 
U.S.-SLOVAK DIALOGUE ON BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL ISSUES 
(REF A).  THE DECISION TO VISIT COMES PARTLY FROM A FEELING 
THAT THE U.S. IS CONCENTRATING ON \"PROBLEM CHILDREN\" IN 
EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, WITH LESS ATTENTION FOCUSED ON SMALL 
BUT FAITHFUL ALLIES LIKE SLOVAKIA.  KORCOK WILL BE ESPECIALLY 
INTERESTED IN HEARING WASHINGTON\'S VIEWS ON NATO ACCESSION 
SCENARIOS AND THE ISTANBUL SUMMIT, WORKING TOGETHER ON 
UKRAINE AND BELARUS, AND U.S. ATTENDANCE AT THE MARCH 19-20 
BRATISLAVA CONFERENCE ON EUROPEAN SECURITY.  INTERLOCUTORS 
SHOULD ENGAGE KORCOK ON U.S. PRIORITIES WHERE THE SLOVAKS CAN 
TAKE A STRONGER ROLE, AND ENCOURAGE THEIR ACTIVISM BOTH 
UNILATERALLY AND IN INTERNATIONAL FORA SUCH AS NATO AND THE 
EU.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) SLOVAKIA IS LOOKING FORWARD IN THE COMING MONTHS TO 
NATO AND EU ACCESSION.  DUE TO THIS, PUBLIC OPINION POLLS 
REVEAL THAT MOST SLOVAKS CONSIDER THE GOS FOREIGN POLICY 
\"SUCCESSFUL.\"  THIS IS THE ONLY AREA WHERE THE DZURINDA 
GOVERNMENT GETS A FAVORABLE RATING.  (NOTE: THE PUBLIC IS 
MUCH MORE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT ECONOMIC REFORMS, AS 94 NEW LAWS 
TOOK EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2004, RESULTING IN PRICE INCREASES FOR 
CONSUMER ITEMS ACROSS THE BOARD.)  PLAYING ON THIS STRENGTH, 
THE MFA IS PLANNING TO FOCUS ON \"NICHE CAPABILITIES\" IN 
FOREIGN POLICY AS MUCH AS IN DEFENSE.  AREAS WHERE SLOVAKIA 
WOULD LIKE TO ASSUME A MORE PROMINENT ROLE INCLUDE RELATIONS 
WITH THE BALKANS; ENCOURAGING REFORM IN UKRAINE, BELARUS, 
MOLDOVA, AND PERHAPS IN OTHER FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS; AND 
THE MIDDLE EAST. 

3. (C) SLOVAKIA, ALONG WITH OTHER ACCESSION COUNTRIES, IS 
INCREASINGLY CURIOUS ABOUT U.S. PLANS FOR BRINGING IN THE NEW 
NATO MEMBERS. (REF B).  WHILE A CELEBRATION WILL BE 
IMPORTANT, WE SHOULD ALSO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CONTINUING MILITARY REFORM, ALLOCATING SUFFICIENT BUDGET FOR 
FORCE 2010, AND DEVELOPING CAPABILITIES THAT MEET THE 
CHANGING NEEDS OF NATO.  SLOVAKIA DESERVES CREDIT FOR HOLDING 
TO THE 2 PERCENT OF GDP LEVEL FOR DEFENSE SPENDING EVEN IN 
THE FACE OF TOUGH ECONOMIC CHOICES (ADMITTEDLY THROUGH 
CREATIVE ACCOUNTING).  KORCOK WILL APPRECIATE EXPRESSIONS OF 
SUPPORT FOR SLOVAK TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, ESPECIALLY 
AS THE GOS PREPARES TO BEEF UP ITS DEMINING CONTINGENT IN 
IRAQ WITH 30 MILITARY POLICE FOR SECURITY.  (PM DZURINDA 
PLANS TO VISIT SLOVAK TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN JANUARY 23.) 
KORCOK SHOULD BE REMINDED THAT OTHER ASPECTS OF THE GWOT 
SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED; FOR EXAMPLE, THE DECREASE IN THE 
BUDGET FOR THE SLOVAK INTELLIGENCE SERVICE HAMPERS THE GOS 
ABILITY NOT ONLY TO COMBAT TERRORISM AND ORGANIZED CRIME, BUT 
ALSO TO PROVIDE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR SECURITY CLEARANCES. 
 
5. (C) SLOVAKIA VIEWS ITSELF AS BEING ON THE FRONT LINES WITH 
UKRAINE AND BELARUS AND WELCOME THE EU\'S ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT 
TOWARDS THOSE TWO COUNTRIES.  IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR KORCOK TO 
HEAR OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN BOTH COUNTRIES AND HOW 
SLOVAKIA AND OTHER NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES CAN BE USEFUL. 
 
6. (C)  PLANNING FOR THE MARCH 19-20 BRATISLAVA CONFERENCE 
CONTINUES APACE, AND WAS FINALIZED DURING MEETINGS THIS 
WEEKEND.  KORCOK SHOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE FOR IT AND 
USG ATTENDANCE. 

7. (C)  BIO NOTE:  KORCOK IS WIDELY VIEWED AS THE LIKELY 
SUCCESSOR TO FONMIN KUKAN IF THE LATTER WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IN APRIL.  FORMERLY DCM IN THE SLOVAK NATO MISSION, 
KORCOK HAS STRONG TRANS-ATLANTICIST BELIEFS AND DOESN\'T 
HESITATE TO EXPRESS THEM.

1. Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
2. (SBU) Summary.  Presidential elections will be held April 
3, with a runoff on April 17 between the two leading 
candidates if needed.  Although the official campaign is the 
two-week period before elections, several candidates are 
already posting billboards and distributing literature with 
general messages.  Key individuals have yet to declare their 
candidacy, but now that the election has been formally 
announced, they have just 21 days to act.  End summary. 
 
What\'s at Stake 
--------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Slovakia\'s President, as head of state, has 
significant diplomatic responsibilities.  His opinion, 
expressed through public speeches and interactions with 
other politicians, carries significant weight.  He also 
appoints and recalls government officials approved by 
Parliament.  He can also veto laws, but the veto is 
relatively easily to overcome with 76 members (50 percent 
plus one) of Parliament.  Thus, his actual political power 
is quite limited.  This election will not necessarily serve 
as a midterm barometer of attitudes toward Parliament or the 
ruling coalition, as not all parties have presidential 
candidates, and the election is much more about individual 
personalities than about party politics. 
 
The Rules of the Game 
--------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Speaker of Parliament Pavol Hrusovsky made the 
official announcement of presidential elections on January 
8.  Individuals now have to announce their candidacy within 
21 days.  Official campaigns may only take place in the two 
weeks prior to the election.  Elections will be held April 
3, with a runoff on April 17 if needed.  A runoff occurs 
when no presidential candidate gains a majority of the 
votes.  Comment: With a crowded field, we fully expect there 
will be a second round. 
 
5. (U) In order to be eligible to run, candidates must 
collect either the support of 15 MPs or 15,000 voters\' 
signatures.  About a dozen individuals have met the 
requirements well in advance.  Many of these have 
essentially started campaigning, giving speeches and, in the 
case of Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan and ANO candidate 
Lubomir Roman, posting billboards with general messages like 
\"Happy New Year.\" 
 
Leading Contenders. and Non-Contenders 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) President Schuster\'s term ends June 15.  His 
popularity has fallen significantly over the nearly four 
years since his election.  He has publicly stated that 
family will be the deciding factor in whether he runs for 
reelection, and his wife strongly prefers he not do so. 
However, he told emboff January 10 he would run, and his 
most recent public speeches (December 5 State of the Nation 
and New Year\'s Day) took a populist stance that would be a 
strong campaign platform. 
 
7. (SBU) HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar, another popular 
would-be candidate, has also not announced whether he will 
run.  Meciar has been very cagey in the press when 
discussing his intentions.  Meciar probably is struggling to 
balance his desire to be back in the national spotlight with 
the strong possibility that he would be defeated for a 
second time.  In the run-up to Parliamentary elections in 
September 2002, Meciar was very sensitive to questions about 
his finances and past actions as Prime Minister, even 
punching a reporter on television who asked about how he 
paid for Villa Elektra (his home that was refurbished at a 
cost far exceeding what he could have afforded on a state 
salary).  Meciar may be hesitant to come under such scrutiny 
again.  There is no other clear leader within HZDS who could 
be a strong candidate.  If Meciar does not run, support may 
fall to Ivan Gasparovic of the breakaway HZD party. 
Gasparovic has the support of other former HZDS members now 
in the \"People\'s Union\" party led by Vojtech Tkac, and of 
the Jan Slota branch of the ultra-nationalist Slovak 
National Party. 
 
8. (U) Kukan, the official SDKU candidate, was the front- 
runner in the first poll in early December and is now 
slightly behind Meciar.  His supporters have been 
distributing door hangers, sponsoring billboards, holding 
numerous functions for supporters and publishing a large 
glossy biographical book about himself - all in general 
terms so as to avoid being called \"campaigning.\" 
 
9. (SBU) Former Ambassador to the U.S. Martin Butora, while 
 
running as an independent candidate, may peel off votes from 
SDKU\'s dwindling pool of center-right voters, as would not- 
yet-candidate SDKU breakaway leader and Free Forum founder 
Ivan Simko. 
 
Preliminary Polls 
----------------- 
 
10. (U) Following is a list of both official and unannounced 
candidates and party affiliations along with their latest 
polling results from the MVK agency: 
-- Vladimir Meciar (HZDS), 20.1 percent 
-- Eduard Kukan (SDKU), 19.3 percent 
-- Ivan Gasparovic (HZD), 15.6 percent 
-- Rudolf Schuster (President), 10.3 percent 
-- Martin Butora (no party affiliation, 15,000 signature 
requirement in lieu of party support), 6.9 percent 
-- Lubomir Roman (ANO), 6.3 percent 
-- Frantisek Miklosko (KDH), 4.2 percent 
Announced candidates Jan Kralik of SDL; Jozef Prokes of 
SNS2; former State Secretary of Foreign Affairs under Meciar 
Jozef Sestak; Martin Mayor Stanislav Bernat; Roma and NGO- 
supported candidate Mikulas Horvath; artist Elena 
Schoppertova; German resident of Slovak origin Vojtech 
Czobor; Swiss resident Julius Kubik; and former deputy Prime 
Minister Jozef Kalman, did not receive statistically 
significant support. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (SBU) Comment. Schuster and Meciar are the wild cards at 
present.  Results may be significantly different if neither 
throws his hat into the ring.  Center-right foes of Meciar 
almost hope he runs, as he would almost certainly lose in a 
second round.  Schuster would likely beat Meciar in a runoff 
because people know what to expect from Schuster both 
domestically and in the foreign policy arena.  If Meciar 
doesn\'t run, Gasparovic and the nationalist extremists could 
see their numbers soar.

SUBJECT: TRAFFICKING VICTIM TELLS HER STORY 
 
1. Summary: A Slovak woman came to Embassy Bratislava 
to provide details on her ordeal of being a victim of 
human trafficking and how she used fraudulent documents 
to enter and remain in the U.S. between 1998 and 2003. 
Conoff and poloff initially interviewed the subject on 
December 29, 2003.  RSO further investigated the 
allegations on January 7, 2004.  The subject was 
seeking advice to clear her U.S. criminal charge of 
grand theft in order to have the option of traveling to 
the United States in the future.  We offer her story of 
how she moved from Slovakia through Europe to the U.S. 
as a snapshot of human trafficking.  Post provided 
information on organizations that offer assistance to 
trafficking victims both in the U.S. and Slovakia.  End 
Summary. 
 
From Slovakia to the Czech Republic 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. In August 1997, a trusting seventeen year old met an 
Albanian national - Tony - at a local Bratislava caf. 
Having known Tony only for a few days, she accepted an 
invitation from him to travel to Prague, Czech Republic 
for a weekend, which turned into two weeks of shopping 
and relaxing at one of the most exclusive hotels in 
Prague.  During their stay Tony purchased clothes for 
her and took her to fine restaurants. 
 
From the Czech Republic to Germany 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. On what turned out to be her last day in Prague, 
Tony introduced her to two other women, one Slovak and 
one Ukrainian.  Shortly after the introduction, all 
three women were told to pack and that they would be 
going to Germany.  When she asked why they were going 
to Germany, she was told nothing except to get into the 
car.  At this point, the subject felt as though the 
situation was out of control and Tony had disappeared. 
The group of women were put in a car and driven to 
Duisberg, Germany by an unknown male.  Once in the car 
the doors were locked and she was not permitted to 
leave.  She assumed she slept at the border crossing, 
because she does not recall showing any documentation. 
 
4. Upon their arrival in Duisberg, Germany, the women 
were taken to an apartment where their handlers changed 
their hair color and brought them new clothes to wear. 
The women were guarded and not allowed to leave the 
apartment except when being transported to a private 
club to work.  At this club, the women were forced to 
engage in sexual acts and nude dancing against their 
will.  During a chance discussion with the club\'s 
owner, she mentioned that she was under 18 years of 
age.  Upon hearing this information, the owner 
discussed the situation with her Albanian handlers. 
After that, she was taken to Rotterdam in the 
Netherlands. 
 
From Germany to the Netherlands 
------------------------------- 
 
5. Arriving in Rotterdam sometime in September, she was 
forced to work in another club.  Again, as in the 
previous club, she was forced to engage in sexual acts 
and nude dancing against her will.  She stated that the 
owner\'s Jamaican girlfriend Michele managed the 
business and was the one to be feared. Several women 
worked voluntarily at the club, but the majority was 
forced to work and live in an apartment in the same 
building.  There were usually between four to eight 
women in single bedrooms.  They were under constant 
supervision and were prohibited from leaving the 
building.  When the handlers were not happy with 
earnings, the women were beaten with care taken not to 
leave bruises.  She often spoke of her situation with 
customers, even though it was strictly prohibited. 
 
From the Netherlands to the U.S. 
-------------------------------- 
 
6.  She lived in Rotterdam for four months until she 
met a club customer, who offered to help her escape the 
situation.  After several meetings at the club, a 
Canadian national - Stanley - spent approximately USD 
 
1,000 to obtain a fraudulent Belgian passport and 
driver\'s license. She suspected that he also paid a 
significant sum to the club for her release.  Both 
walked out of the front door in mid January 1998 and 
she went along with him to get out of Rotterdam. 
 
Living in the U.S. 
------------------ 
 
7. She entered the U.S. in January 1998 in Los Angeles 
under her assumed name and using her fraudulent Belgian 
passport.  Stanley maintained two residences in the 
U.S. and traveled frequently for business. She claimed 
that Stanley was possessive and required that she 
accompany him while traveling around the United States. 
She was left alone quite infrequently.  She was not 
physically prevented from leaving the house and did not 
report any physical abuse; rather \"mental abuse\".  For 
example, Stanley would mention that it was he who 
rescued her from the club in the Rotterdam and that she 
owed him for that. 
 
8. Stanley introduced her to his business associates as 
his wife and they had no other friends.  While living 
in the U.S she contacted her family in Slovakia, who 
had initiated an Interpol search, and was later visited 
by her sister and nephew.  According to a trafficking 
expert at the International Office for Migration (IOM), 
the subject enjoyed a good life with Stanley until she 
realized that he was not going to take her home and 
that she had no legal rights. 
 
Return home 
----------- 
 
9. After approximately four years in the U.S., she 
realized that her fake passport would soon expire and 
that she would be trapped.  She devised a plan to get 
caught stealing a purse, hoping authorities would 
notice her fraudulent passport and force Stanley to 
assist her in someway to return home.  The plan worked 
and she was arrested for grand theft.  Stanley 
discussed the need to renew her Belgian passport or 
risk being caught by INS and deported to Slovakia.  She 
attended her first court hearing, but did not tell the 
police that she was using a false name or that she 
wanted to return to Slovakia. 
 
10. Using her fraudulent Belgian passport, Stanley 
assisted her return to Slovakia to obtain new identity 
documents in her true name.  They traveled from the 
U.S. to Mexico City, Paris, Prague, then finally to 
Bratislava.  This departure from the U.S. was prior to 
her sentencing hearing for her grand theft conviction. 
In September 2003, they stayed in a hotel for the first 
few days in Bratislava.  During this time she told 
Stanley she did not want return to the U.S. with him. 
A few days later Stanley left Slovakia alone, but she 
now worries that he will return for her.  He is 
currently on business in Bangkok, and she also 
speculated about his possible intentions to traffic 
another minor. 
 
Background Information 
---------------------- 
 
11. The subject came from an affluent political family 
in Slovakia and speaks excellent English.  She feared 
deportation or negative press about her experience 
because of her family\'s position in Slovakia.  She is 
currently finishing high school in Bratislava, while 
working as an English teacher and translating for the 
Slovak police. She told RSO that she wanted to clear 
her name in the U.S. court system.  She felt bad for 
stealing the purse and wanted to be able to travel to 
the United States in the future. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. Post offers this narrative to help shed light on 
trafficking patterns and tactics employed by 
traffickers.  Post directed the subject to the 
trafficking unit at Police headquarters and a local 
NGO, both of which were unknown to the subject. She 
 
offered to volunteer her experience in discussion 
groups organized by the International Office for 
Migration (IOM) for young women.  Post advised her to 
retain a lawyer in the U.S. for her criminal case. In 
addition, post provided some addresses of Florida 
trafficking organizations for further advice on legal 
matters.

4.   SECURITY: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REMAINS DEEPLY CONCERNED 
  ABOUT THE SECURITY OF U.S. CITIZENS OVERSEAS. U.S. CITIZENS ARE 
  CAUTIONED TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF VIGILANCE, TO REMAIN 
  ALERT AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO INCREASE THEIR SECURITY 
  AWARENESS. THERE ARE INCREASING INDICATIONS THAT AL-QAIDA IS 
  PREPARING TO STRIKE U.S. INTERESTS ABROAD. IT IS EXPECTED THAT 
  AL-QAIDA WILL STRIVE FOR NEW ATTACKS DESIGNED TO BE MORE 
  DEVASTATING THAN THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK, POSSIBLY INVOLVING 
  NON-CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS SUCH AS CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL AGENTS. 
  TERRORIST ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SUICIDE 
  OPERATIONS, HIJACKINGS, BOMBINGS OR KIDNAPPINGS.  THESE MAY 
  INCLUDE FACILITIES WHERE U.S. CITIZENS AND OTHER FOREIGNERS 
  CONGREGATE OR VISIT, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL AREAS, CLUBS, 
  RESTAURANTS, PLACES OF WORSHIP, SCHOOLS, HOTELS, OUTDOOR 
  RECREATION EVENTS OR RESORTS. U.S. CITIZENS SHOULD REMAIN IN A 
      HEIGHTENED STATE OF PERSONAL SECURITY AWARENESS WHEN ATTENDANCE 
  AT SUCH LOCATIONS IS UNAVOIDABLE.  EMBASSY BRATISLAVA 
  FACILITIES REMAIN AT A HEIGHTENED STATE OF ALERT.  THESE 
  FACILITIES MAY TEMPORARILY CLOSE OR SUSPEND PUBLIC SERVICES 
  FROM TIME TO TIME TO ASSESS THEIR SECURITY POSTURE. 
 
5.   THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC HAS A +ACI-MEDIUM+ACI- RATE OF CRIME, ALTHOUGH 
  VIOLENT CRIME IS RELATIVELY UNCOMMON.  VISITORS ARE URGED TO 
  EXERCISE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS.  IF YOU MUST WALK ALONE AT 
  NIGHT, KEEP TO POPULOUS AND WELL-LIT AREAS.  PAY ATTENTION TO 
  YOUR WALLET, PURSE, HANDBAG AND CELLULAR TELEPHONE, AS ALL ARE 
  POPULAR TARGETS OF THE LOCAL THIEVES.  THE LOCAL PICKPOCKETS 
  ARE PROFESSIONAL AND MOST ACTIVE DURING THE SUMMER.  THEY TEND 
  TO UTILIZE DISTRACTION TECHNIQUES TO CONFUSE THEIR TARGET, 
  PREFERRING LOCATIONS SUCH AS SHOPPING CENTERS, MARKETS AND 
  PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN THE VICINITY OF THE +ACI-OLD TOWN+ACI-, NEAR 
  MAJOR HOTELS WHERE FOREIGNERS STAY AND TOURIST SITES, AND THE 
  NIGHT TRAINS TO PRAGUE AND WARSAW. POWER STRUGGLES WITHIN THE 
  ORGANIZED CRIME, WHICH CAN BE VIOLENT, OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME. 
  THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT/NOT DIRECTED AGAINST AMERICANS OR OTHER 
  FOREIGNERS.  THE RATE OF AUTO THEFT, WHICH IS ALSO CONNECTED TO 
  ORGANIZED CRIME, IS VERY HIGH IN BRATISLAVA.  UP-MARKET 
  EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN CARS ARE PREFERRED TARGETS.  THE USE OF 
  ALARM SYSTEMS OR ANTI-THEFT DEVICES IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. 
 
6.   MEDICAL: IF YOU EXPERIENCE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AFTER WORK

  0903-703-666. IF YOU CANNOT REACH THE DUTY OFFICER, THE EMBASSY 
  HAS A CONTRACT WITH AN ENGLISH SPEAKING SLOVAK DOCTOR, DR. 
  CAPOVA, WHO IS AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY TO PROVIDE

1. Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
Anti-corruption Laws Watered Down, Then Withdrawn 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (U) Parliament returned January 20 to an ambitious 
agenda.  The Conflict-of-Interest law, an important part of 
the Ministry of Justice\'s anti-corruption legislation 
proposals, was watered down significantly before it reached 
a vote.  The law would have set out guidelines for 
transparency and property disclosure for public officials 
from the national government down to municipalities.  The 
most critical change was an increased quorum (three-fifths 
rather than a simple majority) needed to sanction a fellow 
MP.  With the changes, however, the law would be virtually 
unenforceable.  Rather than leave the impractical 
legislation to a vote in the third reading, Justice Minister 
Lipsic withdrew it. 
 
3. (U) Similarly, the Origin-of-Property Law passed by a 
wide margin in the second reading.  But this was only after 
MPs eliminated the provision that would have required a 
suspect to prove in court that he obtained a disputed 
property legally.  The original legislation was aimed at 
giving prosecutors authority to investigate when a public 
official obtained or built property that is worth far more 
than he/she could reasonably be expected to afford on a 
government salary.  As with the conflict of interest law, 
with the provision eliminated, the law would be toothless. 
KDH and Smer MPs voted against the new version of the law, 
but most others voted for it. 
 
4. (SBU) Comment: The watering-down of these important laws 
before passing them on the second reading points to a 
continuing lack of political will to truly fight corruption. 
It is interesting to note in the voting record on the 
property law that some MPs who benefited significantly from 
privatization of industry, such as Vladimir Meciar and 
Viliam Sobona of HZDS, were not present for this vote. 
 
WWII Criminal Arrested in Germany 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) German police arrested Slovak war criminal Ladislav 
Niznansky, who was a member of the Edelweiss unit under the 
Nazi state.  He is accused of burning two villages, Ostry 
Grun and Klak, during World War II and the homicide of 146 
people.  If convicted, Niznansky will be sentenced to life 
in prison.  Niznansky is now a German citizen. 
 
Coalition Now a Minority, But Initiatives Still Pass 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6. (U) Governing coalition initiatives continued to pass, 
despite the ongoing dispute between SDKU and Ivan Simko\'s 
Free Forum.  The Free Forum deputies and other independents 
joined the coalition to pass a pension law.  In addition, 
parliament approved agreements with the Vatican and with 11 
of the registered religions in Slovakia regarding religious 
education.  Beginning in the first grade, students will be 
required to take either a class in their religion or ethics. 
However, there would need to be at least 12 students for a 
class to be taught in any given religion.  Teachers of 
registered religions are paid by the state.  ANO deputies, 
who object to the expansion of religious influence in the 
government and schools, voted against the agreement, as did 
opposition Smer and Communist MPs.  Members of the other 
three coalition parties, all HZDS deputies, independent MPs, 
and members of the breakaway Free Forum and People\'s Union 
parties voted in favor. 
 
Opposition Leaders Meet but Can\'t Agree 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Opposition party leaders held a strategy meeting but 
could not agree on deposing the government.  Neither HZDS 
Chairman Vladimir Meciar nor Smer Chairman Robert Fico would 
want to work together in a new government.  Vojtech Tkac, 
chair of People\'s Union, called a second meeting, still 
hoping for a no-confidence vote, but opposition parties 
again could not agree.  Ivan Simko\'s Free Forum might 
support no-confidence votes on individual ministers, but not 
to recall the government, according to comments he made in 
the press. 
 
Two Deputy Speaker Seats Vacant 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Of four total deputy speaker posts in Parliament, 
only two are now occupied, by Bela Bugar of SMK and Viliam 
Veteska of HZDS.  Zuzana Martinakova of Free Forum resigned 
her post, and Pavol Rusko\'s seat, left empty when he became 
 
Minister of Economy, was never filled, as Lubomir Lintner\'s 
candidacy failed twice. 
 
Presidential Election Pre-Campaigns Continue 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Ivan Gasparovic has 21,900 signatures on a petition 
backing his presidential candidacy, more than the 15,000 
required.  A petition for President Rudolf Schuster\'s 
candidacy was also submitted but reports indicated there was 
a technical problem: Schuster had not included a signed 
statement agreeing to be a candidate.  His spokesman, Jan 
Fule, announced Schuster would run for re-election, but 
Schuster said the next day that he had not yet decided.  He 
has not clarified his intentions since, and has until 
January 29 to file. 
 
10. (U) Independent presidential candidate (and former 
Ambassador to the United States) Martin Butora held a pre- 
campaign event called \"Slovakia Through the Eyes of Martin 
Butora.\"  The standing-room-only audience of about 200 
included many prominent intellectuals and NGO leaders as 
well as Smer MP Robert Kalinak.  Butora outlined ten areas 
for improvement in Slovakia in a speech called \"Crisis is an 
Opportunity for Growth,\" including citizens\' growing 
distrust in government, wide disparities between different 
regions of Slovakia, and excessive influence of special- 
interest groups.  He also addressed issues of European 
integration and transatlantic relations with a somewhat 
critical eye.  The speech lasted about an hour and was 
followed by thoughtful, lengthy questions and answers. 
 
Ruling Coalition Rift in Trencin Mirrors National Scene 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
11. (SBU) The ruling coalition in Trencin (Slovakia\'s 10th 
largest city) has broken up over disagreements about 
candidates for mayor, to replace former mayor and SDKU 
regional chair Juraj Liska, who became defense minister late 
last year.  A coalition of KDH, ANO, Democratic Party (DS) 
and SDKU won 22 of 25 council seats as well as the mayoral 
seat in December 2002 local elections.  Last October, the 
coalition had agreed to nominate Branislav Celler of DS, 
whom KDH opposes due to his controversial personality and 
business interests.  KDH will support its own candidate, 
possibly acting mayor Jan Kratky.  Comment: During a recent 
visit to Trencin, poloffs noted evident strain between KDH 
and ANO representatives, who would barely speak at lunch 
together.  If the coalition cannot come together to support 
a candidate, HZDS could regain control of the mayor\'s seat. 
 
Schuster Visits Egypt to Forge New Ties 
--------------------------------------- 
 
12. (U) President Schuster took a three-day trip to Egypt. 
He hoped to develop stronger relations and new economic ties 
between the two countries as well as cooperation in 
international organizations, such as support for Slovakia as 
a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2006 
and 2007.  He met with Egyptian President Muhammad Hosni 
Mubarak, Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Ebeid, and Ahmed Fathy 
Sorour, the president of the Egyptian People\'s Assembly.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH PRESIDENT SCHUSTER ON 
UKRAINE, EGYPT, PRESIDENTIAL RACE 
 
REF: KIEV 129 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR RONALD WEISER FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 

1. (C) SUMMARY.  AMBASSADOR WEISER MET WITH SLOVAK PRESIDENT 
RUDOLF SCHUSTER ON JANUARY 28.  THEY DISCUSSED HIS 
CONVERSATION THAT MORNING WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT LEONID 
KUCHMA, WHO IS SEEKING A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ALLOW 
FOR HIS REELECTION.  SCHUSTER ALSO DESCRIBED HIS SUCCESSFUL 
TALKS WITH EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK DURING HIS TRIP 
TO EGYPT.  SCHUSTER CONFIRMED HIS CANDIDACY FOR REELECTION 
AND OFFERED PREDICTIONS FOR THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL RACE IN 
SLOVAKIA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) PRESIDENT SCHUSTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR IN A JANUARY 28 
MEETING THAT HE HAD THAT MORNING RECEIVED A CALL FROM 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT LEONID KUCHMA, WHO SAID HE BELIEVES HE 
HAS THE NECESSARY SUPPORT IN PARLIAMENT FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL 
AMENDMENT TO ALLOW HIM TO RUN FOR REELECTION.  KUCHMA ALSO 
TOLD HIM THAT SIMILAR CALLS HAD BEEN MADE TO THE LEADERS OF 
HUNGARY AND POLAND.  THE AMENDMENT, WHICH NEEDS SIXTY PERCENT 
OF THE VOTES IN PARLIAMENT TO PASS, WOULD CHANGE THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PROCEDURE FROM A POPULAR VOTE TO A 
PARLIAMENTARY VOTE (FURTHER DETAILS REFTEL).  SCHUSTER SAID 
KUCHMA THINKS ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF MPS WILL SUPPORT THE 
AMENDMENT.  THE APPROXIMATELY 100 SUPPORTERS OF VIKTOR 
YUSHCHENKO WOULD OPPOSE IT.  SCHUSTER NOTED THAT KUCHMA HAD 
REVERSED WHAT HE TOLD HIM LAST YEAR, WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD BE 
LEAVING THE PRESIDENCY.  SCHUSTER ALSO SAID THAT IF REMAINING 
AS PRESIDENT WAS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION, IT WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT FOR SLOVAKIA TO BE CRITICAL OF ITS NEIGHBOR. 
 
3. (C) DURING HIS TRIP TO EGYPT, SCHUSTER HAD A 50-MINUTE 
ONE-ON-ONE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK THAT WAS 
    ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR TEN MINUTES.  SCHUSTER DESCRIBED THE 
MEETING AS EXCEEDINGLY CORDIAL.  MUBARAK EXPRESSED STRONG 
APPRECIATION AND SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POSITION ON MIDDLE EAST 
PEACE TALKS.  HE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THE SLOVAK POSITION IN 
PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. BOTH MORALLY AND WITH TROOPS 
ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ.  SCHUSTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE FELT 
HE DEVELOPED A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH MUBARAK, WHICH WAS 
REFLECTED IN SOME VERY SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENTS SIGNED FOR 
FUTURE SLOVAK-EGYPTIAN COMMERCE.  HE SAID THAT THE MINISTERS 
THAT HE MET WITH THE FOLLOWING DAY HAD RELAYED TO HIM THAT 
THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS BY MUBARAK TO MEET THE 
SLOVAK REQUESTS.  THERE WERE ALSO DISCUSSIONS OF EGYPT 
POSSIBLY BUYING SLOVAK-MANUFACTURED ARMS IN THE FUTURE. 
 
4. (C) SCHUSTER ALSO MENTIONED THAT HE HAD BEEN INVITED BY 
BAVARIA PREMIER EDMUND STOIBER, THE OPPOSITION CANDIDATE IN 
GERMANY\'S LAST CHANCELLOR\'S RACE, TO MEET IN MUNICH AT THE 
BEGINNING OF MARCH.  HE INTENDS TO GO TO MUNICH AND DISCUSS, 
AMONG OTHER THINGS, SLOVAK SUPPORT FOR THE POLISH POSITION ON 
THE EU CONSTITUTION. 
 
5. (C) ON INTERNAL POLITICS, SCHUSTER INDICATED THAT HE, AND 
MOVEMENT FOR A DEMOCRATIC SLOVAKIA (HZDS) CHAIRMAN VLADIMIR 
MECIAR, WOULD BOTH RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  SCHUSTER PREDICTED HE 
AND MECIAR WOULD BATTLE FOR THE SECOND SPOT IN A RUNOFF WITH 
FOREIGN MINISTER EDUARD KUKAN.  MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRACY (HZD) 
CANDIDATE IVAN GASPAROVIC\'S SUPPORT WILL BEGIN TO DROP, 
SCHUSTER SAID.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHY MECIAR WOULD 
RUN, REALIZING HE COULD NOT WIN, SCHUSTER EXPLAINED THIS WAS 
PART OF MECIAR\'S AGREEMENT WITH THE SLOVAK DEMOCRATIC AND 
CHRISTIAN UNION (SDKU) UNDER WHICH HZDS WILL SUPPLY 
    UNOFFICIAL SUPPORT TO THE MINORITY GOVERNMENT IN RETURN FOR 
THEM \"LEAVING HIM ALONE.\"  SCHUSTER EXPECTS SUPPORTERS OF THE 
SMER PARTY WILL SPLIT ON THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE, WITH THOSE 
LED BY PARTY VICE-CHAIR MONIKA BENOVA AND BRATISLAVANS 
SUPPORTING GASPAROVIC AND SMER SUPPORTERS IN EASTERN SLOVAKIA 
VOTING FOR SCHUSTER.  FIVE SMER DEPUTIES FROM THE KOSICE 
REGION HELPED COLLECT THE SIGNATURES OF 15 MPS SUPPORTING HIS 
CANDIDACY, SCHUSTER SAID, AND NEARLY 50,000 SIGNATURES HAVE 
BEEN COLLECTED FROM THE PUBLIC SO FAR, WITH ONLY 15,000 
NEEDED. 
 
6. (C) SCHUSTER CONFIRMED TO THE AMBASSADOR THE IMPORTANCE 
THAT HE GIVES TO THE SLOVAK/U.S. RELATIONSHIP AND THAT HE 
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO STRENGTHEN IT.

SUBJECT: NEW NBU DIRECTOR FINALLY APPOINTED 
 
REF: BRATISLAVA 03 1079 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. RONALD WEISER FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D 

1.  (C) AFTER MONTHS OF COALITION WRANGLING, THE SLOVAK 
CABINET APPOINTED AUREL UGOR AS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY OFFICE (NBU) ON JANUARY 28.  PRIOR TO THIS 
APPOINTMENT, UGOR WORKED IN THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
(VSS), SERVING AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE FIRST DEPARTMENT SINCE 
OCTOBER 2003.  THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION IN THE PRESS AS 
TO WHICH BRANCH OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE HE WORKED FOR, BUT 
THE SLOVAK INFORMATION SERVICE AND THE MILITARY DEFENSIVE 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (VOS) CONFIRMED TO EMBOFF THAT UGOR WAS 
EMPLOYED BY THE VSS.  UGOR TOLD THE PRESS THAT HE INTENDS TO 
CONCENTRATE ON THE LAW ON CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND WHO WILL 
HAVE ACCESS TO IT.  HE PLANS TO MEET WITH HIS COUNTERPARTS 
FROM THE OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES SOON. 
 
2.  (C) UGOR\'S NOMINATION CAME AS A SURPRISE TO EVERYONE WHO 
HAS BEEN WATCHING THE NBU.  THERE WAS ONE PRESS PIECE A WEEK 
AGO THAT MENTIONED UGOR AND HIS NAME RESURFACED ONLY A DAY 
BEFORE THE CABINET MET TO APPROVE HIS NOMINATION.  ACCORDING 
TO LOCAL PRESS, ANO PROPOSED UGOR AS THE NEW DIRECTOR, BUT HE 
DOES NOT KNOW ANO CHAIRMAN PAVOL RUSKO.  UGOR WAS SUPPORTED 
BY IVETA HENZELYOVA, AN ANO DEPUTY FROM KOSICE WHO HAS 
REFUSED TO COMMENT ON HOW SHE KNOWS UGOR.  (NOTE:  HENZELYOVA 
DOES SIT ON THE SIS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE.)  A LOCAL NEWSPAPER 
REPORTED THAT ANO HAD APPROACHED SEVERAL OTHER NBU EMPLOYEES 
OFFERING TO SUPPORT A BID FOR THE DIRECTOR POSITION IN RETURN 
FOR GRANTING SECURITY CLEARANCES TO ANO LOYALISTS.  GIVEN HIS 
RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL POSITION AT THE VSS, EMBOFFS HAVE NOT 
YET MET UGOR. 
 
3.  (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, UGOR WAS BORN IN 1966 IN 
    PRESOV.  HE STUDIED AT THE HIGHER MILITARY ACADEMY IN 
VYSKOVA, IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY ECONOMICS, GRADUATING 
IN 1990.  HE ALSO COMPLETED POST-GRADUATE STUDIES, 
SPECIALIZING IN INTELLIGENCE.  HE WAS NEVER A MEMBER OF THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY.  UPON GRADUATION, HE BEGAN WORKING IN THE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.  ACCORDING TO 
THE PRESS, HE HAS A TOP SECRET CLEARANCE AS WELL AS A NATO 
CLEARANCE.  HE HOLDS THE RANK OF COLONEL.  UGOR SPEAKS 
ENGLISH AND RUSSIAN.  HE IS MARRIED WITH ONE CHILD. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT:  THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY RUMORS AS TO WHY UGOR 
WAS SELECTED.  CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
FRANTISEK MIKLOSKO TOLD EMBOFF THAT PRIME MINISTER DZURINDA 
HAD AGREED TO SUPPORT CANDIDATES BACKED BY COALITION 
PARTNERS, AS LONG AS THERE WOULD BE SPACES FOR SDKU LOYALISTS 
IN THEIR INSTITUTIONS.  IN ADDITION, DZURINDA SOUGHT 
ASSURANCES FROM KDH THAT FORMER NBU DIRECTOR MOJZIS WOULD NOT 
WORK FOR VLADIMIR PALKO AT THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR. 
ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS AND MOJZIS, HE WILL WORK AT THE 
MOI AFTER HE COMPLETES HIS COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE AT THE 
END OF FEBRUARY.  MOJZIS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK IN A SMALL 
ANALYTICAL GROUP UNDER THE AUSPICES OF JOZEF SATEK\'S NEW 
ANTI-CORRUPTION UNIT.  IF MOJZIS WORKS FOR SATEK, ANOTHER 
POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN DZURINDA AND THE KDH IS CERTAIN TO 
ERUPT.

12 Candidates File in Presidential Race 
--------------------------------------- 
 
1. By the January 30 deadline, there were 12 presidential 
candidates, listed here in order of preference among 
potential voters in the most recent poll: Eduard Kukan, 
Vladimir Meciar, Rudolf Schuster, Ivan Gasparovic, Lubo 
Roman, Martin Butora, Frantisek Miklosko, Jan Kralik, Jozef 
Kalman, Stanislav Bernat, Jozef Sestak, and Julius Kubik. 
Meciar and Schuster waited until the last day to declare. 
Schuster explained to media, \"it would be insincere of me to 
disrespect the voices of those who called on me to run for 
re-election.\"  Meciar\'s statement was, \"If the presidential 
elections were ultimately decided based on the theory of a 
lesser evil, I would be the president.\"  Details about each 
candidate appeared in reftel. 
 
Convictions for Corruption Increase 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. According to Ministry of Justice and General Prosecutor\'s 
Office statistics, convictions under existing anti- 
corruption laws have increased significantly in 2003.  In 
2002, 16 individuals were sentenced for corruption and 334 
for misuse of public authority.  In the first half of 2003, 
28 people were sentenced for corruption (out of 87 
investigated by the police, 51 were accused), and 251 
individuals were sentenced for misuse of public authority 
(of 420 investigated, 357 were accused).  Surveys show 
Slovaks are concerned about corruption, but in practice 
corruption is still underreported.  Nonetheless, more cases 
are coming to light.  Members of the anti-corruption unit 
caught an Army Lieutenant Colonel accepting a $500 bribe 
from an officer to prolong the officer\'s contract in 
Eritrea.  Contracts in foreign countries are attractive and 
competitive because salaries are significantly higher.  A 
few days later, a Bratislava gynecologist was caught taking 
SKK 7,000 ($213) after threatening to drop a patient from 
his roster if he was not paid the money. 
 
Trouble Festers in Slovak National Party 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. Several events have kept the Slovak National Party in the 
headlines recently.  Peter Sulovsky and Zilina mayor Jan 
Slota both continue to claim chairmanship of the party. 
Slota suggested a nationalist \"megacongress\" to determine 
who should be chairman.  On January 20, a bomb exploded 
beneath Sulovsky\'s car.  Earlier in the month, Anna 
Malikova, who claims deputy chairmanship of the party under 
Slota, complained loudly and publicly about being barred 
from the SNS office in Bratislava by guards loyal to 
Sulovsky.  Recent comments by Slota that a Roma activist 
should be expelled from the country and that the police 
treat Roma too well explain why human rights observers are 
quite satisfied with the nationalists\' internal bickering. 
 
SDKU Sues Kalinak for Releasing \"Skupinka\" Names 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4. SDKU has filed a lawsuit against Smer deputy Robert 
Kalinak for releasing the names last summer of the 
\"skupinka\" PM Dzurinda alleged was destabilizing the state, 
saying he got the list from a source close to the PM.  SDKU 
wants an apology and SKK 500,000 ($15,244) in damages. 
Kalinak counters that it has since become clear that he made 
no mistake. 
 
Figel Will Be Slovakia\'s Eurocommissioner 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. During the Coalition Council meeting on January 27, 
former EU negotiator Jan Figel was selected to be Slovakia\'s 
first European Commissioner.  Figel, 43, is a member of the 
Christian Democrat Movement (KDH), chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee in Parliament, and was State Secretary of 
the MFA from 1998 to 2002 between his Parliament terms. 
During his 1992-1998 term as MP, he also held two positions 
in the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. 
 
ABA-CEELI Closes After Successful Decade 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. The American Bar Association\'s Central and East European 
Law Initiative (ABA-CEELI), the last SEED program in 
Slovakia, closed January 27 with a ceremony featuring DCM as 
well as Justice Minister Daniel Lipsic, a former CEELI staff 
member.  The program also held final roundtables on public 
procurement and on judicial reform.  Judges at the 
roundtable praised the electronic court system.  They noted 
that that the new system streamlines court administration, 
but there is still work needed to change the habits of 
judges and clerks. 
 
Two Constitutional Revisions Under Consideration 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7. Two constitutional amendments are advancing through 
Parliament despite government opposition.  One bill would 
require ministers to seek, and hew to, Parliament\'s explicit 
direction on all matters under discussion within the EU, 
which the GOS finds impractical.  The other would extend 
MPs\' immunity from prosecution for statements made in 
Parliament.

ADDED THAT SLOVAKIA IS CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE ISSUE AND IS 
TROUBLED BY THE AMENDMENT.  HE PREDICTED THAT THE AMENDMENT 
WOULD PASS TO THE SECOND READING, AND NOTED THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN UKRAINE HAS ALREADY RULED THAT THE 
AMENDMENT WOULD NOT POSE A PROBLEM. 
 
2. (C) VIZDAL EMPHASIZED THAT UKRAINE IS USUALLY UNRESPONSIVE 
TO \"DECLARATIONS\" AND IN FACT WILL TEND TO DO THE OPPOSITE OF 
WHAT IS ASKED.  AS FOR SLOVAKIA\'S INFLUENCE, VIZDAL NOTED 
THAT WHILE SLOVAKIA AND UKRAINE HAVE A GOOD DIALOGUE, UKRAINE 
SEES ITSELF AS A REGIONAL LEADER THAT, WITH ITS POPULATION OF 
50 MILLION, HAS LITTLE REASON TO LISTEN TO SLOVAKIA, A 
COUNTRY ONE-TENTH UKRAINE\'S SIZE.  HISTORICALLY AND 
ECONOMICALLY, POLAND HAS BEEN A MUCH CLOSER PARTNER WITH 
UKRAINE.  IF THE UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT DOES APPROVE THE 
AMENDMENT, THERE WILL BE LITTLE SLOVAKIA CAN DO.  VIZDAL ALSO 
OBSERVED THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE NO OTHER CANDIDATE BESIDES 
KUCHMA WHO HAS ENOUGH SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN UKRAINE. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT: MFA OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD US IN THE PAST THAT 
THEY WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP \"NICHE CAPABILITIES\" IN FOREIGN 
POLICY, INCLUDING THE BALKANS AND SLOVAKIA\'S EASTERN 
NEIGHBORS.  POLICY TOWARD UKRAINE, BELARUS, MOLDOVA AND OTHER 
FORMER STATES OF THE USSR WILL BE A MAJOR THEME OF DISCUSSION 
AT THE MARCH 18-19 BRATISLAVA II CONFERENCE HOSTED BY PM 
    DZURINDA.  WHILE PRESIDENT SCHUSTER\'S VIEW OF KUCHMA (REF A) 
IS COLORED BY THEIR FRIENDSHIP, LOWER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT 
ARE PRODUCTIVELY ENGAGING UKRAINIAN COUNTERPARTS ON ISSUES 
SUCH AS BETTER LAW-ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION AT THE BORDER. 
SLOVAKIA CAN\'T INFLUENCE UKRAINE SINGLE-HANDEDLY, BUT WOULD 
SUPPORT A V-4, EU, OR U.S. INITIATIVE THAT ENGAGES 
REFORM-ORIENTED UKRAINE LEADERS.

OUTCRY OVER LINKING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND REFERENDUM 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
2. (U) PRESIDENT SCHUSTER\'S DECISION TO SCHEDULE THE 
REFERENDUM ON EARLY PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS THE SAME DAY AS 
    THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION (APRIL 3) SPARKED IMMEDIATE 
CRITICISM.  OPPONENTS SAID THE MOVE WAS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
REELECTION CAMPAIGN PLOY TO SCHUSTER\'S ADVANTAGE.  PM 
DZURINDA TOLD MEDIA THAT LINKING THE TWO VOTES WAS \"UNFAIR 
AND DISHONEST.\"  THE RULING COALITION HAS VOWED TO TAKE THE 
MATTER TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.  (COMMENT: THE TACTIC OF 
REFERRING THE ISSUE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT MIGHT 
BENEFIT THE COALITION BY DELAYING THE REFERENDUM BEYOND 
APRIL 3, AND THUS ENSURING LOW VOTER TURNOUT.  HOWEVER, IT 
COULD ALSO BE USED AGAINST THE COALITION.  THE RULING 
PARTIES WILL MEET FEBRUARY 9 TO WEIGH THEIR OPTIONS.) 
 
HZDS VICE-CHAIR: REFERENDUM MOMENTUM SLOWING 
-------------------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) POLOFFS MET WITH HZDS VICE-CHAIRMAN SERGEJ KOZLIK 
THE DAY AFTER SCHUSTER\'S ANNOUNCEMENT.  HE ESTIMATED ONLY 35 
PERCENT OF VOTERS WOULD PARTICIPATE, SAYING THE NEGATIVE 
MOMENTUM CREATED BY PRICE INCREASES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
YEAR WOULD BE LOST BY APRIL.  AS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION, KOZLIK PREDICTED THAT VLADIMIR MECIAR, WHO WAS 
PUSHED BY HZDS LEADERSHIP AND REGIONAL STRUCTURES AS WELL AS 
PERSONAL AMBITION TO RUN, WOULD MAKE IT TO THE SECOND ROUND. 
HE SAID POLLING NUMBERS FOR EDUARD KUKAN AND IVAN GASPAROVIC 
ARE INFLATED.  KOZLIK CONFIRMED THAT HZDS PLANS MORE 
SYSTEMATIC AND VISIBLE OPPOSITION-POLITICS, SINCE SUPPORTERS 
HAVE CRITICIZED THE PARTY FOR SEEMING TOO CLOSE TO THE 
COALITION.  HOWEVER, THERE IS NO HOPE FOR COMMON GROUND WITH 
FELLOW OPPOSITION PARTY SMER.  HZDS SEES ITS ALLIES IN OTHER 
CENTER-RIGHT PARTIES, AND ITS MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE 
NATIONALIST FACTIONS.  KOZLIK WILL RUN THE HZDS CAMPAIGN FOR 
JUNE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS, IN WHICH HE EXPECTS 
    TURNOUT TO BE VERY LOW. 
 
BREAKAWAY PARTIES: EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE\'S UNION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
4. (SBU) POLOFFS ALSO MET WITH VOJTECH TKAC, CHAIR OF 
PEOPLE\'S UNION (LU), WHICH SEPARATED FROM HZDS LAST YEAR. 
SUPPORT FOR LU IN POLLS HAS DECREASED TO BELOW ONE PERCENT 
SINCE THE SPLIT.  NONETHELESS, TKAC SAID 40-80 NEW MEMBERS 
JOIN THE PARTY WEEKLY.  HE EXPLAINED THAT LU HAS BEEN 
WORKING WITH JAN SLOTA\'S SLOVAK NATIONALIST PARTY (SNS) FOR 
PRAGMATIC REASONS, NOT BECAUSE HE AGREES WITH NATIONALIST 
IDEOLOGY--BOTH LU AND SLOTA SUPPORT IVAN GASPAROVIC FOR 
PRESIDENT.  TKAC SAID MECIAR IS NOT A DEMOCRAT AND IS UNABLE 
TO MANAGE THE HZDS MPS.  IN ADDITION TO HIS PERSONAL 
AMBITION, MECIAR HOPES TO RAISE HZDS\' PROFILE BY GETTING TO 
THE SECOND ROUND IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  BOTH TKAC 
AND KOZLIK PREDICTED THAT THE REFERENDUM ON EARLY ELECTIONS 
WOULD FAIL AND THAT THE DZURINDA GOVERNMENT WOULD PERSEVERE 
THROUGH THE END OF ITS FOUR-YEAR TERM. 
 
WOMEN IN POLITICS...NOT 
----------------------- 
5. (SBU) MP JOSEF HERIBAN (ANO) HAS PROPOSED MANDATING THAT 
EVERY THIRD CANDIDATE ON A PARTY LIST BE A WOMAN.  AT LUNCH 
HOSTED BY THE DCM, HERIBAN AND OTHER LEADERS DESCRIBED GAINS 
WOMEN HAVE MADE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, NGO\'S, AND THE ARTS, 
BUT SAID THEY LAGGED BEHIND IN PUBLIC OFFICE.  MP EVA CERNA 
(ANO) NOTED THE LACK OF A \"WOMEN\'S CAUCUS\" IN PARLIAMENT, 
SINCE FEMALE MP\'S FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS RATHER THAN THEIR 
CONSCIENCES.  SHE ADDED THE MEDIA WAS OFTEN MORE INTERESTED 
IN HER HAIRSTYLE THAN HER OPINIONS.  THERE ARE LARGE NUMBERS 
    OF WOMEN AT LOWER LEVELS IN MINISTRIES, BUT SINCE DECISIONS 
ARE MADE FROM THE TOP DOWN, THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY INFLUENCE 
POLICY.  SEVERAL PROFESSIONAL WOMEN HAVE COMMENTED TO POLOFF 
THAT SLOVAKIA\'S GENEROUS MATERNITY BENEFITS (UP TO THREE 
YEARS OF GOVERNMENT-SUBSIDIZED LEAVE) MAKE WOMEN UNCOMPETIVE 
ON THE LABOR MARKET, AS EMPLOYERS ARE OPENLY UNWILLING TO 
HIRE WOMEN OF CHILD-BEARING AGE.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: MARR, PREL, PGOV, PINR, LO, NATO, Nato 
SUBJECT:  SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF GEN JAMES L. JONES, 
SACEUR 
 
1.   (SBU) During your visit as SACEUR to Slovakia on 
February 12-13, you may wish to emphasize the following 
priorities that the U.S. and NATO share: 
 
-- encourage the GOS to maintain their commitment to 
spend two percent of GDP on defense; 
 
-- thank the GOS for their contributions to Operation 
Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom as well as 
their intended deployment to ISAF in May; 
 
-- encourage the GOS to stay the course on military 
reform and professionalization. 
 
Political Dynamics 
------------------ 
 
2.  (SBU) Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda\'s government 
is a center-right coalition made up of four parties 
that were elected in the fall of 2002 to a four-year 
term.  Although this government is more ideologically 
coherent than its predecessor, also led by Dzurinda, it 
has faced considerable challenges since its formation. 
Dzurinda recalled Minister of Defense Ivan Simko in 
September 2003 for what he described as 
insubordination.  Simko would not support the Prime 
Minister\'s decision to recall the head of the National 
Security Office (NBU), which issues NATO security 
clearances.  Juraj Liska, a member of Dzurinda\'s party 
and former mayor of Trencin, was named Defense Minister 
in October. 
 
3.  (SBU) Your visit will include a meeting with 
President Rudolf Schuster, who is running for 
reelection in April.  The president has little formal 
power in Slovakia, but can influence decisions by using 
his office as a bully pulpit and can veto legislation. 
There are currently 12 candidates in the race, but only 
three or four -- including Schuster, Foreign Minister 
Eduard Kukan, and former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
-- have any real chance of making it into the second 
round. 
 
4.  (SBU) Opposition parties and labor unions have 
organized a referendum calling for early elections, 
which Schuster wants to hold concurrently with the 
Presidential election to attract greater voter turnout. 
Slovakia has had only one successful referendum since 
independence with the others failing due to a lack of 
voter turnout.  The referendum is non-binding, so the 
decision to hold early elections would still have to be 
made in parliament, where it would likely fail. 
 
Defense Spending 
---------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The Slovaks committed to spending 2 percent 
of GDP after the Prague Summit.  For 2004, the defense 
budget is 1.81 percent of GDP, but additional outlays, 
including settlement of Soviet-era debt, should bring 
total defense spending to 2.02 percent.  However, 
Finance Minister Miklos has argued strongly that 
defense spending be cut and it is unclear whether the 
GOS and parliament have the willpower to keep defense 
spending at a real 2 percent in the out years. 
 
OIF/OEF/ISAF 
------------ 
 
5.  (SBU) Per capita, Slovakia is one of the most 
active international peace-keeping nations with nearly 
800 personnel deployed in 11 missions.  The GOS, with 
only minimal public backing, strongly supported the war 
in Iraq and sent a chem-bio consequence management unit 
to Kuwait under Czech command.  After the end of 
hostilities, the unit (82-strong) was replaced with an 
engineering unit that is currently deployed in the 
Polish sector.  The Slovak parliament recently agreed 
to increase the number of troops deployed in Iraq, 
adding 23 to increase security. 
 
 
6.  (SBU) The Slovaks also have a 40-person air-field 
construction unit deployed as part of OEF at Bagram Air 
Base in Afghanistan.  Their six-month mandate has been 
extended three times.  Prime Minister Dzurinda visited 
this unit in January.  Currently there is a proposal to 
send a 16-person demining unit to Afghanistan under 
ISAF command.  This would be Slovakia\'s first mission 
under the NATO flag. 
 
Military Reform 
--------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) This year the Ministry of Defense will 
conduct a mid-course review of its long-term military 
reform strategy Force 2010.  The review will take into 
account changes in NATO Force Goals as well as 
different realities in Slovakia.  The Slovaks are 
committed to developing their chemical defense unit as 
a niche capability for NATO.  The other niche 
capabilities the Slovaks have identified are military 
police and engineers. 
 
8.  (SBU) Defense Minister Liska recently commissioned 
a new study on the air force which recommended 
extending the life of 10 MiG-29s plus 2 trainers, 
rather than follow the paths of their neighbors and 
issue a tender for fighters.  The study also suggested 
upgrading 18 Mi-24 attack helicopters (they are 
planning for 10) and acquiring 2-4 medium lift 
transport aircraft by 2010.  They are considering 
acquiring C-130s under the Excess Defense Articles 
program.  This proposal is still in the early stages, 
but the Slovaks are very interested.  We have 
encouraged Liska to incorporate the study within the 
larger context of Force 2010.

STERILIZATION REGULATIONS 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - protect accordingly. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. On January 29, Ambassador Weiser met with 
Health Minister Zajac to discuss the new draft regulation on 
sterilization and overarching reforms in health care, 
particularly pertaining to the Roma minority. The Ambassador 
pressed Zajac to incorporate recommendations from 
international and domestic specialists into the 
sterilization law. The Health Ministry had been in the 
center of controversy after the January 2003 publication of 
\"Body and Soul,\" a report that alleged over one hundred Roma 
women were victims of coerced sterilizations. Zajac said the 
GOS had done its best to investigate allegations of coerced 
sterilization, find violations, and seek solutions. 
Discussions also included health care programs for returned 
victims of trafficking and the donation of medical supplies 
that had been arranged by the Ambassador. End Summary. 
 
New Sterilization Regulations: Concrete Suggestions 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (SBU) On January 29, Ambassador Weiser met Health 
Minister Zajac to discuss newly proposed regulations 
governing sterilization. The Health Ministry had been in the 
center of controversy after the January 2003 publication of 
\"Body and Soul,\" a report that alleged over one hundred Roma 
women were victims of coerced sterilizations. The Ambassador 
noted the ensuing investigation had revealed problems in the 
health care system that could be resolved to the benefit of 
everyone.  Minister Zajac admitted mistakes had been made in 
minority policy.  He said the GOS had done its best to 
investigate the allegations, find violations, and seek 
solutions.  With regard to recent health reform and legal 
proposals, the ambassador expressed appreciation for GOS 
attention to international concerns. 
 
3. (SBU) The Ambassador urged Zajac to include 
recommendations from numerous human rights and medical 
specialists in the new regulations on sterilization.  (The 
Ambassador in a letter also encouraged Justice Minister 
Lipsic, as Chairman of the Legislative Council, to support 
the suggestions.)  Specifically, the Ambassador asked that 
the new regulations: 
 
-- Incorporate a clear definition of \"informed consent.\" The 
absence of such a definition may result in the continuation 
of the very practices which have recently come under 
criticism. 
-- Institute a mandatory waiting period between the time 
the patient gives consent and the surgical procedure.  This 
would allow a more cautious approach to sterilization, 
especially after repeat caesarians and for minors. 
-- Eliminate the list of medical indicators for 
sterilization.  There is no internationally accepted norm, 
and such lists do not clearly define the procedure as 
elective. 
-- Elimination of sterilization committees.  The committees 
are obstacles to better communication between practitioners 
and patients about reproductive health and do not ensure 
quality service to the patients. 
 
4. (SBU) Zajac stated that these concerns would be addressed 
in the next ethics committee meeting, with due consideration 
given to the comments submitted by the Ambassador. 
 
Aftermath of the MOH Investigation 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) According to Zajac, the MOH investigation found 
violations of the previous sterilization regulation that 
affected two minors. The Ministry was not able to find fault 
with hospitals or doctors, but admitted that laws in this 
area were ill-defined. He added that investigators lacked 
data on ethnicity. However, Health Ministry specialists 
believe that more non-Romany women underwent sterilizations 
than Roma. Zajac added the ministry had already responded to 
nearly 400 out of 1000 letters from concerned individuals 
and organizations about the allegations of coerced 
sterilizations and the subsequent investigation. He 
indicated that they intended to respond to all of them. He 
also said that specialists from the ministry participated in 
discussions with the Government Office for Human Rights and 
attended several conferences on the topic. 
 
6. (SBU) Zajac noted Roma settlements have severe health 
concerns and reform is just beginning down a long road. 
Significant structural changes were needed to improve 
preventive health care and educational opportunities for 
marginalized groups. Specifically, he wants to encourage the 
insurance industry to support preventive health care and 
pressure practitioners to protect patients\' rights.  He 
discussed current proposals for Roma health projects, which 
 
 
included two mobile emergency units and a possible 
specialized office for minority affairs. He promised that 
his ministry will continue to confront problems instead of 
avoiding them as in the past. 
 
Health Care Reform and American Assistance 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7. (U) Zajac gave the Ambassador a brief explanation of the 
health care reform package, loosely modeled on Oregon health 
care, and stated he intended to move these reforms through 
quickly while political will exists. The Ambassador 
suggested the Minister and his staff might visit the U.S. to 
discuss minority outreach programs and indigent care with 
American counterparts and to strengthen relationships 
between American and Slovak hospitals. Zajac stated this was 
a high priority. The Ambassador mentioned that he had 
arranged with the University of Michigan hospitals for the 
shipment of two pallets of medical supplies to the 
children\'s hospital in Kosice. Two American corporations, 
U.S. Steel and Plastipak, were paying the cost of shipping. 
Zajac indicated his appreciation for the donations. 
 
Trafficking in Persons 
---------------------- 
 
8. (U) The Ambassador urged the minister to develop 
assistance programs for victims of trafficking. He stated 
that while numbers of returned victims are not high compared 
to other countries in the region, the treatment of 
transmittable or life threatening diseases and psychological 
counseling should be provided for returning victims. He 
added that victim protection and prosecution of traffickers 
are not the only aspects to battle this global problem, and 
Slovakia could serve as a future model for other nations in 
providing medical treatment and health counseling. Zajac 
responded that this was an area that they were already 
examining and that he would look at ways to establish a 
program to meet the health needs of trafficking victims. 
 
Policy on Pharmaceuticals 
------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Minister Zajac also mentioned concerns from the 
pharmaceutical industry about Slovakia\'s recently adopted 
policy on medicines. He stated that while multi-national 
companies are concerned about limited access to non- 
generics, the ministry is battling serious corruption 
problems and the high cost of drugs. The Ambassador replied 
he believed there were some misconceptions and suggested 
Zajac meet with the companies for further discussion. Zajac 
said he planned to address drug companies at an American 
Chamber of Commerce event in the near future, which the 
Ambassador could attend.

GASPAROVIC IS AN INTERESTING CANDIDATE AND SHARES SOME OF 
SMER\'S VIEWS, THE PARTY WILL NOT SUPPORT A CANDIDATE THAT HAS 
LITTLE CHANCE TO MAKE IT INTO THE SECOND ROUND.  IN A RECENT 
MEETING BETWEEN FICO AND SCHUSTER, FICO SUGGESTED TO THE 
PRESIDENT THAT HIS OPPONENTS WILL TRY TO USE HIS AGE--AT 70 
SCHUSTER IS THE OLDEST CANDIDATE IN THE RACE--AGAINST HIM AND 
THAT TO COUNTER THESE CHARGES, SCHUSTER SHOULD TALK OPENLY 
ABOUT HIS HEALTH AND VITALITY.  (NOTE:  IN AN ARTICLE IN SME 
ON FEBRUARY 2, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE WAS HEALTHIER NOW 
THAN BEFORE HIS SURGERY IN JUNE 2000 THAT NEARLY KILLED HIM, 
AND THAT HE PLAYS TENNIS REGULARLY.)  FICO SAID THAT SMER 
WOULD NOT OFFER SUPPORT TO FOREIGN MINISTER KUKAN OR FORMER 
PRIME MINISTER MECIAR IN THEIR BIDS FOR PRESIDENCY.  FICO 
PROJECTED THAT TWO OF THE FOLLOWING THREE CANDIDATES WOULD 
MAKE IT INTO THE SECOND ROUND:  KUKAN, SCHUSTER, OR MECIAR. 
 
REFERENDUM WILL BE SUCCESSFUL 
----------------------------- 
 
    3.  (C) FICO PREDICTED THAT THE REFERENDUM ON EARLY 
ELECTIONS, WHICH SCHUSTER CONFIRMED IN HIS MEETING WITH FICO 
WILL BE HELD ON APRIL 3, WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.  FICO ESTIMATED 
THAT 65 PERCENT OF THE ELECTORATE WILL TURN OUT FOR THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THEREFORE HE THOUGHT THAT THE 
REFERENDUM WOULD GET AT LEAST THE 51 PERCENT OF THE REQUIRED 
PARTICIPATION TO MAKE THE REFERENDUM VALID.  HE WAS CONFIDENT 
THAT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE VOTING WOULD FAVOR EARLY 
ELECTIONS.  FICO ADDED THAT LEADERS FROM ANO, THE CHRISTIAN 
DEMOCRATS (KDH), AND THE HUNGARIAN COALITION PARTY (SMK) 
WOULD SUPPORT THE CALL FOR EARLY ELECTIONS IN PARLIAMENT IF 
THE REFERENDUM WAS VALID. 
 
WORKING WITH FREE FORUM 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WORKING WITH IVAN 
SIMKO\'S FREE FORUM, FICO REPLIED THAT SIMKO HAS INDICATED 
THAT HIS PARTY MAY SUPPORT SMER-GENERATED CALLS FOR VOTES OF 
NO CONFIDENCE IN FINANCE MINISTER IVAN MIKLOS AND ECONOMY 
MINISTER PAVOL RUSKO.  FICO ADDED THAT HE EXPECTS TO WORK 
WITH SIMKO IN PASSING THE LAWS ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND 
PROPERTY DISCLOSURE.  FICO OPINED THAT SIMKO HAD MISSED HIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A VIABLE THREAT TO PRIME MINISTER 
DZURINDA AND THE SLOVAK DEMOCRATIC AND CHRISTIAN UNION 
(SDKU).  FICO CRITICIZED SIMKO\'S EXPLANATION TO THE PUBLIC 
THAT FREE FORUM SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM BUT IT DID 
NOT SUPPORT DZURINDA, SUGGESTING THAT THE AVERAGE SLOVAK 
FOUND THIS EXPLANATION TO BE CONFUSING.  (NOTE:  IN A LATER 
MEETING WITH SIMKO, HE INDICATED TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE 
WOULD SUPPORT A NO CONFIDENCE VOTE ON RUSKO BUT NOT MIKLOS 
    UNLESS THE FINANCE MINISTER MAKES A MAJOR MISTAKE OR UNLESS 
THE ALLEGATIONS FICO MADE AGAINST MIKLOS ARE PROVEN TRUE.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C) FICO HAS BECOME MUCH MORE POLISHED IN HIS MEETINGS 
WITH THE AMBASSADOR.  HIS VIEWS ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
AND IVAN SIMKO ARE REALISTIC.  HOWEVER, SOME OF FICO\'S OTHER 
STATEMENTS CONFLICT WITH WHAT EMBOFFS HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER 
SOURCES.  NONE OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS IN ANO, KDH, OR SMK HAVE 
SAID THEY WOULD SUPPORT EARLY ELECTIONS.  FICO TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO A TRIP TO WASHINGTON 
THIS SPRING.

SUBJECT: THE SDKU DIVORCE 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald Weiser for reason 1.4b. 
 
1. (C) Summary: Former Defense Minister Ivan Simko\'s new 
\"Free Forum\" party is the product of both a personality 
conflict and a struggle for power with PM Dzurinda.  However, 
Simko\'s indecision about making a complete break from the 
SDKU and its government program lost him momentum.  Coalition 
parties were ready to accept him as a partner, but he threw 
away the opportunity with his demand that Dzurinda step down. 
 Simko is no longer a strong competitor on the political 
scene. 
 
2. (C) Dzurinda did not extend an olive branch to Simko. 
This political calculation was clever in one way, but 
counterproductive in another.  Simko is no longer a threat to 
Dzurinda within the SDKU, nor is Simko with his fledgling 
party a threat to Dzurinda on the larger political scene. 
However, Dzurinda now leads a minority government, and it 
will be much harder to get legislation passed through 
parliament.  Dzurinda made political mistakes in late 2003, 
but seems to have learned from his errors.  The coalition 
government will likely stay in office to the end of its term, 
and continue to push through its aggressive reform agenda. 
End summary. 
 
A Brief History of the SDKU and Recent Events 
--------------------------------------------- - 
3. (C) As told to P/E Chief by SDKU insider Frantisek Stano 
(who managed the 2002 parliamentary election campaign and has 
known Simko and Dzurinda for a decade since they were in KDH 
together), the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKU) 
party was the brainchild of Ivan Simko.  Dissatisfied under 
the leadership of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) in 
the mid-1990\'s, he envisioned an enlightened modern party 
that would meld strong values with modern business 
principles.  Simko\'s intellectual capacity and organizational 
ability were matched by Mikulas Dzurinda\'s charisma, and when 
the group split from KDH, it was clear that Dzurinda would be 
the public face and billboard \"leader,\" and Simko would run 
the party behind the scenes.  This arrangement worked well 
for several years.  According to Kamil Homola (Director of 
SDKU\'s central office, presidential campaign manager for FM 
Kukan, and 25-year old nominee for \"young politicians\" IV 
program in 2004), the trouble between Dzurinda and Simko 
began at the 2002 party congress, when Simko \"shocked\" 
Dzurinda by tossing his hat into the ring for leadership of 
the SDKU.  Dzurinda won, but was miffed, and there has been 
tension ever since. 
 
4. (C) Simko told DCM and P/E chief that the trouble began 
only in the fall of 2003.  He said Dzurinda\'s announcement of 
the \"skupinka\" or little group harming Slovakia\'s interests 
made clear his misuse of the Slovak Information Service 
(SIS).  Furthermore, Dzurinda\'s decision to fire National 
Security Office (NBU) chief Jan Mojzis without consulting 
cabinet members and party leaders showed a new leadership 
style unpalatable to many in the SDKU.  To summarize four 
months of press stories, Simko refused to support the sacking 
of Mojzis, was fired as Defense Minister and Deputy SDKU 
chairman, formed the \"Free Forum Platform\" as a movement for 
a \"return to values\" within the SDKU, and in January 
finalized the divorce with Dzurinda by registering \"Free 
Forum\" as a new political party with 7 MPs.  He was invited 
to join the coalition, but refused to do so as long as 
Dzurinda remained Prime Minister.  However, he vowed to 
support the government program of reform. 
 
What Motivates Simko? 
--------------------- 
5. (C) Both Stano and Homola characterized Simko as a 
respected politician who had a grand vision, but was growing 
frustrated with his relative lack of power in what he viewed 
as \"his\" party.  Stano said that Simko can\'t stand to be 
number two, but doesn\'t have the stamina or charisma to be 
number one.  He has good ideas, but doesn\'t know how to work 
hard, for example pounding the pavement for votes.  Homola 
professed admiration for Simko, his former political science 
professor who got him his SDKU job, but said his ego blocked 
his judgment in this case.  Hungarian Coalition Party (SMK) 
Secretary General Peter Voros and SMK Spokesperson Livia 
 
SIPDIS 
Pokstaller lamented that Simko\'s primary motivation at this 
point is his personal feud with Dzurinda, which he puts ahead 
of national interests. 
 
6. (C) Simko\'s indecision on how cleanly to make the break 
lost him momentum.  He astounded leaders of the KDH, SMK, and 
ANO, who were fully prepared to offer him a seat as the fifth 
member of the governing coalition, by refusing to join as 
long as Dzurinda remains prime minister.  On the other hand, 
he has said both publicly and privately that he will support 
the government\'s reform agenda.  (He recently back-tracked by 
opposing the coalition\'s proposed education reforms.)  He 
disappointed Smer and other opposition parties by refusing to 
support early elections.  Politicians and the public are left 
scratching their heads and asking, \"What does Simko want?\" 
 
Simko has laudable goals such as legislating reforms in the 
SIS and NBU, strengthening parliamentary oversight, and 
keeping defense reform on track.  However, apart from this 
legislative list, he seems to be drifting without a compass. 
 
7. (C) Fellow MP\'s view Simko as an introvert who lacks the 
spark to lift his new party off the ground.  It is doubtful 
that he can build yet another political party in Slovakia\'s 
already-saturated field.  We asked Simko point-blank how he 
planned to win support and differentiate himself from the 
SDKU of Dzurinda.  He answered, \"We need a plan.\" 
 
What Motivates Dzurinda? 
------------------------ 
8. (C) According to Stano, Dzurinda evaluates people as 
individuals, rather than as members of a team.  Individuals 
that he trusts, such as his controversial advisor Sergei 
Michalic, can do anything.  Individual grudges, however, go 
deep and last long.  Stano gave as an example Dzurinda\'s 
feeling of betrayal when Jan Figel refused to leave the KDH 
with Dzurinda and Simko, which almost cost Figel an 
appointment as Slovakia\'s EU Commissioner .  Homola described 
Dzurinda\'s favoritism for youthful energy, saying the first 
question he asked about new employees was, \"How old is he?\" 
Stano said that Dzurinda resents being told directly what he 
should do, particularly by foreign governments, and sometimes 
does the opposite just to prove he can.  On the flip side, 
Dzurinda advisor and pollster Tatiana Rosova said Dzurinda 
considers his legacy to be integration of Slovakia into NATO 
and the EU, so he obviously cares very much what foreign 
governments think of him. 
 
9. (C) In November, Rosova told P/E chief that Dzurinda 
realized coalition politics were getting out of hand, and he 
was toning down his rhetoric towards other politicians, and 
especially in the press.  Rosova said SDKU\'s falling numbers 
in the polls did not indicate a defection of voters to other 
parties but to \"undecided,\" due to disenchantment with party 
strife.  Homola said when the going got tough and Bratislava 
looked bleak, Dzurinda started calling SDKU leaders in the 
regions to mobilize support.  Dzurinda\'s strategy to return 
to his previous \"consultative\" leadership style, to ignore 
Simko, and to stop public battles seems to have paid off. 
Opinion polls published in January show SDKU\'s numbers still 
low, but on the rise again. 
 
Coalition Partners Unhappy, but Muddling Through 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
10. (C) All coalition partners are upset to be in a minority 
government.  But they are determined to stick it out through 
the end of their term, with the support of defectors from 
other parties, independent MPs, and the Free Forum.  None 
profess support for early elections.  Voros and Pokstaller of 
the SMK said that Simko is not a real player and he took with 
him only \"lackluster MP\'s.\"  SMK believes Simko was pushed by 
others within Free Forum to call for Dzurinda\'s dismissal, 
because he was not so radical in private talks with SMK chair 
Bela Bugar.  KDH MP and presidential candidate Frantisek 
Miklosko gushed to P/E chief, \"I like Dzurinda, I really do. 
It\'s a shame he let things deteriorate so far.  His old style 
of consulting everyone before making a decision was better.\" 
KDH has refrained from public comment and is watching with 
some pleasure as the former \"betrayers\" of KDH fight with 
each other.  With party leader Pavol Rusko safely ensconced 
in the Ministry of Economy, ANO sided early with Dzurinda. 
 
Comment 
------- 
11. (C) Constitutionally and under the coalition agreement, 
the PM was in his full right to fire a cabinet minister from 
his party who had lost his trust.  Simko\'s struggle against 
Dzurinda for power within the SDKU was probably as much a 
factor in his removal as his unwillingness to go along with 
sacking Mojzis.  When Simko first created the \"Free Forum 
Platform,\" said Homola, Dzurinda offered to discuss Free 
Forum\'s complaints at a May 2004 party congress--essentially 
dismissing Simko for 6 months.  Dzurinda did not hold out an 
olive branch to Simko.  Dzurinda\'s calculation was clever in 
a way, stupid in another.  Simko is no longer a threat to 
Dzurinda within the SDKU, nor is Simko with his fledgling 
party a threat to Dzurinda on the larger political scene. 
However, it will be much harder work now to get legislation 
passed through parliament.  Dzurinda made political mistakes 
in late 2003, but seems to have learned from his errors.  The 
coalition government will likely stay in office to the end of 
its term, and not only survive, but continue to push through 
one of the most aggressive and successful reform agendas in 
Central Europe.

SUBJECT:  SLOVAK MOD INTERESTED IN C-130 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT 
 
 
1. (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR CONSULTED WITH MINISTER OF DEFENSE 
LISKA AND CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF CEROVSKY ON 5 FEBRUARY 
AND 10 FEBRUARY, RESPECTIVELY, TO DISCUSS SLOVAK INTEREST IN 
ACQUIRING A NUMBER OF C-130 MEDIUM TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT.  BOTH 
LISKA AND CEROVSKY EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE AMBASSADOR\'S 
SUGGESTION THAT THE SLOVAKS ACQUIRE 4 TO 6 C-130E TRANSPORT 
AIRCRAFT (WHICH ARE BEING REPLACED IN THE US AIR FORCE FLEET 
BY THE MODERNIZED C-130J, BEGINNING AROUND 2005-2006) UNDER 
THE EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES PROGRAM.  UPGRADES TO THE 
AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED WOULD BE PAID FOR OUT OF THE SLOVAK 
DEFENSE BUDGET.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE AMBASSADOR ADVISED 
DEFENSE OFFICIALS TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL IMPACT 
OF THIS ACQUISITION. 
 
2.  (SBU)  THE ACQUISITION OF THIS TYPE OF AIRCRAFT HAS 
THREE MAIN BENEFITS TO THE SLOVAK ARMED FORCES.  FIRST, IT 
WOULD PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO SELF-DEPLOY ITS FORCES TO 
NATO AND OTHER COALITION OPERATIONS, ELIMINATING THE NEED TO 
SECURE CONTRACT STRATEGIC LIFT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS 
UKRAINE OR RUSSIA.  SECOND, SLOVAKIA WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER 
THEATER LIFT ASSETS TO NATO OR COALITION OPERATIONS, THUS 
DEVELOPING A SORELY NEEDED NATO NICHE CAPABILITY.  FINALLY, 
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY FOR SLOVAKIA TO CONTRACT ITS 
THEATER LIFT TO OTHER NATIONS IN THE REGION, WHICH 
REPRESENTS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF REVENUE AS WELL AS PRESTIGE 
IN THE REGION.  FURTHERMORE, THE SLOVAKS MAY WELL CONSIDER 
ATTEMPTING TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT IN REPAIR FACILITIES 
    LOCATED AT THE LETECKE OPRAVOVNE TRENCIN (AIRCRAFT REPAIR 
COMPANY TRENCIN) WITH THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING A REGION DEPOT- 
LEVEL MAINTENANCE FACILITY IN TRENCIN. 
 
3.  (SBU)  A RECENTLY PUBLISHED STUDY ON THE FUTURE OF THE 
SLOVAK AIR FORCE RECOMMENDED THE ACQUISITION OF AT LEAST TWO 
MODERN TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT BY THE YEAR 2010, ALTHOUGH NO SUCH 
PLANS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE SLOVAKS\' DEFENSE REFORM PLAN 
2010.  DURING AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO SLOVAKIA BY SUPREME 
ALLIED COMMANDER EUROPE (SACEUR), CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF 
CEROVKSY DISCUSSED THE C-130 AS A POSSIBLE NICHE CAPABILITY 
FOR SLOVAKIA.  GEN JONES CONFIRMED THAT LIFT WAS PERHAPS THE 
MOST IMPORTANT NEED FOR NATO FORCES AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE 
SLOVAKS SERIOUSLY CONSIDER ADDING THIS ACQUISITION TO THEIR 
PLANS. 
 
4.  (SBU)  SLOVAK DEFENSE OFFICIALS ARE CAREFULLY EVALUATING 
THE ACQUISITION OF C-130 AIRCRAFT AND HAVE SUBMITTED A LIST 
OF QUESTIONS TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION BEFORE DECIDING TO 
PROCEED WITH A REQUEST FOR THE AIRCRAFT.  THEIR US ADVISOR, 
CUBIC APPLICATIONS, INC., HAS TOLD THE EMBASSY THAT THE 
SLOVAKS HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO SECURE FINANCING 
(CONFIRMED BY LOCKHEED MARTIN REPRESENTATIVES AS AVAILABLE) 
TO PURCHASE AND UPGRADE THE AIRCRAFT TO A FULLY OPERATIONAL 
STANDARD (COST ESTIMATED AT $50 TO $60 MILLION FOR 5 TO 6 
AIRPLANES) IF THEY WOULD GIVE UP SOME OTHER PARTS OF THEIR 
CURRENT PLAN WHICH ARE NOT BENEFICIAL TO NATO AND WHICH MOST 
PROBABLY DO NOT ENHANCE THEIR OWN DEFENSE CAPABILITIES.

------------------------------------ 
2. (U) One element of the government\'s sweeping economic 
reforms is cutting social benefits for some unemployed while 
providing incentives to seek jobs.  Recognizing the dearth 
of employment opportunities in parts of Slovakia, the 
central government allocated funds to municipalities, which 
in turn were supposed to create community service jobs. 
Unemployed individuals who performed such jobs would receive 
a \"bonus\" payment in their social benefits.  The new system 
of social benefits will take effect March 1.  Unfortunately 
the municipalities and local labor offices are still 
unprepared to implement the programs designed to take the 
bite out of the benefit cuts. 
 
3. (U) As word spread about the impending reductions in 
social benefits, many Roma communities became alarmed.  Roma 
will be particularly affected by the cuts, especially those 
in settlements, where unemployment can reach 100 percent. 
Most leaders, such as Government Plenipotentiary for Roma 
Klara Orgovanova, called for Roma to protest through legal 
means.  Others called for more radical measures. 
 
Looting in Eastern Slovakia 
--------------------------- 
4. (U) On February 18, eighty Roma looted a supermarket in 
Levoca in eastern Slovakia.  Local Roma residents claimed 
they needed to steal food for their families in light of the 
changes to the welfare system.  Grocery store looting spread 
to several other towns, with the latest tactic to send women 
and children, since police are reluctant to use force 
against them.  Store owners report that staples like bread 
and milk are not looted; alcohol, cigarettes, and candy 
disappear.  In the southeastern town of Trebisov February 
24, police believed several hundred Roma intended to loot a 
store, and they dispersed the group using high-pressure 
water hoses and tear gas. 
 
5. (U) The increasing violence has alarmed citizens of all 
ethnic groups.  The Association of Young Roma in Banska 
Bystrica warned that the store looting might grow into a 
national problem full of \"xenophobia, brutality and hate.\" 
The Roma Council of Slovakia is cooperating with police to 
calm the social turmoil, and proposed creating a guard force 
involving Roma themselves. 
 
What is Really Behind the Violence? 
----------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Initially, some press reports and government 
officials said that Roma usurers had organized the raiding 
parties out of fear they would lose income when benefits 
decrease.  Orgovanova told emboffs that usurers, while 
highly influential in Roma communities, were not the main 
cause of the looting and protests.  Rather, prominent Roma 
leaders and members of political parties are campaigning in 
Roma settlements against current GOS reforms, which has 
contributed to the escalation of tensions in the region. 
 
7. (SBU) A reporter for Roma newspaper Romano Lil, Denisa 
Havrlova, informed POL assistant that Roma from settlements 
and other friends from eastern Slovak villages have told her 
about communist party (KSS) members going around and 
instigating people to rebellion.  They argue that Roma were 
much better off during the former regime when they had 
enough to eat, they had jobs, and were taken care of.  Now 
they don\'t have any of this and so as soon as this 
government is out, a new government (including the KSS) may 
be able to help them much more effectively. 
 
8. (SBU) An MP from PM Dzurinda\'s SDKU party told P/E chief 
February 24 that the same forces behind organizing the April 
3 referendum on early elections--including the labor unions 
and SMER party--were behind the tumult in Roma communities. 
In addition, Jana Kviecinska, the Director of the Government 
Office for Human Rights, told POL assistant that she knows 
about communists, labor unionists and other political 
activists of the opposition visiting Roma and inciting them 
against the GOS.  They are urging Roma to participate in the 
 
April 3 referendum, by promising improvement of their 
situation after the fall of the Dzurinda government. 
 
Initial Government Action 
------------------------- 
9. (U) The GOS has reinforced security in eastern Slovakia 
with 2000 extra police and 1000 soldiers.  Prime Minister 
Dzurinda and Minister of Interior Palko traveled to Kosice 
February 24 for a first-hand view.  The same day, Minister 
for Labor and Social Affairs Kanik brainstormed with Roma 
leaders on ways to diffuse the situation. 
 
10. (SBU) Ladislav Richter, Chair of the Council of Roma 
NGO\'s, told POL assistant that Kanik and his staff were very 
forthcoming.  They agreed on twelve points to assist Roma to 
obtain jobs and maximize social benefits.  Most notably, 
Kanik accepted Richter\'s proposal that Roma NGO\'s, in 
addition to municipalities, be able to obtain government 
funding to create community service jobs.  In addition, the 
Roma leaders agreed with Kanik that in early March Richter 
will try to put together a session of Roma leaders from all 
over Slovakia to meet with economy ministers, Kanik, Palko 
and Dzurinda.  They hope to find some mechanism to resolve 
this crisis. 
 
Government Approves Labor Minister\'s Recommendations 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
11. (SBU) The cabinet held a February 25 meeting to decide 
how to react to the Roma concerns and avoid further 
violence, at which Kanik presented the \"Twelve Points.\" 
Kviecinska, a long-time human rights activist, phoned POL 
assistant immediately after the meeting.  She was very happy 
with Dzurinda\'s leadership on the issue and the decisions 
reached by the GOS.  She said all the economic ministers 
were very well prepared for the session and were very 
constructive. The PM opened the meeting by saying, \"This is 
the time for action and we have to get things done!\" 
Kviecinska was very excited about the outcome. 
 
12. (SBU) The GOS approved the Twelve Points, including 
Richter\'s proposal to allow NGO\'s, organizations like Red 
Cross, and charities to assist Roma through creating 
community jobs.  Civil servants dealing with social issues 
will work closer to Roma; some of them will be administering 
services directly in settlements. Ministers were asked to 
find more job opportunities and subsidies for \"persons with 
long-term unemployment,\" i.e. Roma.  The GOS also extended 
the age limit for practical training (which graduates from 
any type of school may use) to 25 years.  Employers receive 
state subsidies for each person they employ, and the 
apprenticeship time is calculated into retirement benefits. 
Kviecinska said this will help young Roma.  She added that 
many of these things could have been adopted before, \"but 
there was no political will.  However, finally the GOS took 
real action!\" (Comment: We understand these measures do not 
require parliamentary action.) 
 
13. (U) The Twelve Points (Note internal numbering) 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
1) Increase bonus for those in community service jobs from 
SKK 1,000 to 1,500, beginning in April or September 2004. 
 
2) Take preventive measures against usury: pay social 
benefits more often, in goods, monitored by the police in 
the worst-affected localities. 
 
3) Provide bonuses for organizers of larger \"activation 
programs\" (creating community service jobs for more than 100 
workers) including municipalities and NGOs. 
 
4) Motivate employers to hire long-term unemployed: 
government will pay for the training selected by the 
employer for up to 10,000 SKK 
 
5) Extend the age limit for the post-school practice period 
to 25 years; lengthen the period of the practice beyond 
current six months, increase the benefit from 1,000 to 1,500 
SK.  Community service work should be recognized as one of 
the forms of the practice. 
 
6) Apply all reform laws systematically.  Increase 
information of both unemployed and officials about the full 
range of possible social benefits, ensure all municipal 
offices are able to provide them. 
 
7) Increase social stipends for high school students, 
including transportation costs to and from the school. 
 
8) Assist elementary schools students by providing free 
meals, textbooks, and school supplies in areas with high 
 
unemployment.  Perhaps provide parents with transitory one 
time contribution for costs related with school attendance 
(shoes). 
 
9) Reconsider the price structure for utilities; set an 
existential minimum of utilities (a strictly limited package 
for a minimum price). 
 
10) Reimburse travel costs related to seeking a job. 
 
11) Take action against usury, by police and law enforcement 
agencies. 
 
12) Speed up the start of the Fund for Social Development, 
which will provide for community partnerships for social 
inclusion, and start programs specifically for the 
inhabitants of settlements. 
 
Comment 
------- 
14. (SBU) It is too early to tell whether the government\'s 
\"Twelve Points\" will entirely calm the situation, but the 
GOS has surprised many by acting swiftly and decisively. 
With just over a month before the Presidential election and 
referendum on early elections, political interests are 
playing a leading role in the development of this social 
issue.  Emboffs will meet with Roma activists and local 
officials in eastern Slovakia February 26 and 27.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, ELAB, SOCI, LO 
SUBJECT: ECONOMIC REFORM: THE VIEW ON THE GROUND 
 
1.  Summary.  A radical tax overhaul, price liberalization 
and tightening of social benefits in recent months have 
combined to drastically alter the way most Slovaks view 
their incomes.  Approximately 90 new laws came into effect 
on January 1, 2004 along with a host of other changes in 
recent months.  While the GOS budget and the economy as a 
whole are on better off, nearly everyone has a new equation 
to use to calculate his income and many pensioners and 
unemployed people will be the most affected.  Reductions in 
social benefits have led to social unrest by Slovakia\'s Roma 
minority, the vast majority of which are long-term 
unemployed (septel).  Opposition parties and some 
presidential candidates hope to capitalize on public 
unhappiness in upcoming elections.  End summary. 
 
CUT IN SOCIAL BENEFITS 
---------------------- 
 
2.  Slovakia\'s generous program of social and unemployment 
benefits are often blamed as being disincentives for people 
to find work.  The country\'s unemployment rate is 16 
percent, half of which have been out of work for more than 
two years.  Historically, many recipients of unemployment 
benefits defrauded the system by having jobs on the black 
market.  This allowed them to earn far more than they 
otherwise could have, and had the double burden of cheating 
the GOS of income tax revenue and costing it unnecessary 
benefits payments.  On March 1 these benefits will be 
reduced by approximately 15 percent (short-term unemployment 
benefits by more than 50 percent) as the GOS introduces a 
new workfare program.  By performing community service or 
taking jobs at minimum wage, recipients will be able to 
regain or exceed their previous level of income that was 
formerly completely dependent on social benefits 
(unfortunately, it appears that a sufficient number of 
community service jobs will not be ready in time).  Social 
unrest has broken out within Roma communities, which often 
have unemployment rates above 90 percent, to protest the 
cuts in benefits (septel). 
 
19 PERCENT FLAT TAX RATE 
------------------------ 
 
3.  The most drastic change for the general public is a new 
19 percent flat tax rate for individuals and corporations. 
Previously, individuals paid taxes of between 10 to 38 
percent divided between five different tax rates, and the 
corporate rate was 25 percent. While the flat tax is 
expected to be revenue neutral overall, it represents a 
large tax cut to higher income earners.  The GOS hopes this 
will encourage them to actually pay their taxes and reduce 
the rate of tax evasion.  (Note: The Slovak National Tax 
Office estimates that overall 20 to 30 percent of taxes go 
unpaid in Slovakia.)  To help offset the effect of raising 
lower income earners\' taxes from 10 percent to 19 percent, 
the GOS greatly increased the amount of tax deductions for 
the working poor.  Middle-income earners who are single are 
likely to pay higher taxes while a family of four would get 
a nearly 10 percent benefit.  However, the National Tax 
Office told econoff that the new program could hurt 
pensioners and the unemployed. 
 
19 PERCENT UNIFIED VAT 
---------------------- 
 
4.  Slovakia\'s previous two-tier value added tax regime was 
set at 20 percent for most items, but 14 percent for 
necessities such as food, electricity and natural gas.  The 
rise from 14 percent to 19 percent falls disproportionately 
hard on people in lower income brackets.  In simple terms it 
equals a five percent increase in inflation for basic 
necessities.  Critics of the new plan note that EU laws do 
not require a unified VAT.  Instead, they specifically allow 
for reduced VAT on necessities, medicines and other 
sensitive products. 
 
PRICE INCREASES 
--------------- 
 
5.  For several years, the GOS has been liberalizing utility 
prices from their previously highly subsidized rates, and 
2004 is the last year of liberalization before prices are 
considered to be at market rates.  Natural gas prices are 
expected to rise more than 30 percent (including the new VAT 
rate) for households in 2004 although they will drop by 
about two percent for industrial and public sector clients. 
Electricity prices will increase an average of 6.7 percent 
(including the new VAT) this year.  A local research group 
predicts a 14 to 20 percent jump in food prices due to the 
new VAT, increased farm costs and entry into the EU.  In 
August last year, the GOS raised excise taxes on petroleum 
products, beer and cigarettes that raised the overall price 
of gasoline and diesel by more than 10 percent, beer by 
approximately 10 percent and cigarettes by 20 percent 
 
(including a second tax increase in January 2004).  These 
tax increases were initiated to make up for a short fall in 
tax revenues.   To add to consumers\' problems, inflation hit 
its highest rate in four years in 2003 at 9.3 percent and is 
estimated at 5.5 - 7.3 percent this year. 
 
HEALTHCARE AND COLLEGE NO LONGER FREE 
------------------------------------- 
 
6.  In June 2003, the GOS initiated a new fee-for-service 
program in the healthcare sector.  Although the fees seem 
nominal by western standards, they represent a high cost for 
many Slovaks who consider free healthcare a right of 
citizenship.  Slovakia\'s healthcare sector is deeply in 
arrears and its debts are rising due to a public accustomed 
to frequent doctor visits and doctors that over prescribed 
drugs (many of which are discarded).  The new charges 
include USD 0.63 for visiting a doctor\'s office, having a 
prescription filled, or spending the night in a hospital, 
although many exemptions were created to minimize the 
negative effects of this policy.  In addition, an increase 
in the cost of numerous drugs has helped make the Ministry 
of Health one of the least popular departments of the GOS. 
However, through the first six months of the plan medical 
costs are down and the sector\'s debts are rising at a slower 
pace.  This September, the GOS also plans to introduce the 
concept of college tuition.  Previously free undergraduate 
and graduate programs will cost approximately USD 125 to 650 
per year excluding books, housing and meals. 
 
7.  Comment.  The GOS has made many correct moves in recent 
years to prepare the country for NATO and EU membership, 
attract foreign investment, and generally catch up with the 
development of its neighbors.  Furthermore, the USG, the 
IMF, and other international organizations agree with the 
recent changes listed above, and have even promoted the idea 
of reducing social benefits for years.  However, the rapid 
pace at which some of these changes are being implemented -- 
before adequate numbers of community service jobs could be 
created and before the jobs created by new foreign 
investment flooding the country (septel) can take hold -- 
shows a lack of preparedness on the part of the GOS. 
Changing a decades-old- culture of living off the dole would 
prove difficult under the best of circumstances.  This view 
of economic hard times is the backdrop for the upcoming 
presidential election and referendum on early elections 
called for by labor unions and opposition parties. 
Coalition politicians seem determined to stay the course on 
reforms, but they may pay high political costs by not taking 
into account how the reforms are viewed by Slovakia\'s most 
vulnerable.  Opposition parties like SMER and KSS are trying 
to use this issue to force a government change, and 
President Schuster is campaigning for reelection on a 
platform which heavily criticizes the government\'s actions.

Same Date, Separate Elections 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The referendum on early parliamentary elections, 
though scheduled for the same day as the presidential 
election, will not be on the same ballot because the 
referendum requires a different electoral commission and 
polling station.  Speculation that polling places for the 
two votes could end up across town is likely not true 
(separate rooms is more probable) but as a result of the 
separation the cost will be the same as if the elections 
were held on separate dates.  There will still be 
disincentives for voters, since they will have to wait in 
two separate lines to vote in both elections.  Smer MP 
Kalinak told poloffs Smer is divided about supporting Rudolf 
Schuster for re-election; some in the party prefer Ivan 
Gasparovic.  Kalinak added that Foreign Minister Eduard 
Kukan\'s closeness to PM Dzurinda, considering coalition 
troubles and upset over the fast pace of economic reforms, 
may hurt Kukan at the polls. 
 
OSCE May Want to Monitor Election 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) OSCE representatives told polec officers that while 
they are confident in the electoral process, they are 
considering a monitoring mission because some member states 
are concerned about the pairing of the presidential election 
and a referendum on early Parliamentary elections, and about 
Vladimir Meciar\'s participation. 
 
Gasparovic: If I Get to Second Round, I Could Win... 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4. (SBU) Movement for Democracy (HZD) Chairman Ivan 
Gasparovic told poloffs on February 24 that he expects the 
first round of presidential elections to be tough, but if he 
happened to make it to the second round, Gasparovic said he 
could win.  He laments lack of funding and visibility 
compared to the three candidates ahead of him in the polls, 
who are in government and appear frequently in the media. 
He expects support from the six percent of voters who 
indicate a preference for the Slovak National Party, saying 
they support Zilina mayor Jan Slota\'s wing, not that of 
Peter Sulovsky (whom he called a \"nobody\").  He rejected the 
idea that he was allying with extremists and said his 
Coalition of National Forces will serve to push extremism 
out of nationally-oriented parties.  If Meciar wins, it 
might be a good thing, Gasparovic said, as Meciar would 
concentrate on the office, protecting his property, and 
ensuring his and his children\'s financial safety, leaving 
the top post in HZDS open for Gasparovic to claim.  In 
Gasparovic\'s opinion, the two men have no hope for 
reconciliation.  (Comment: Gasparovic has been somewhat 
marginalized since his split with Meciar and HZDS before the 
2002 election in which his HZD did not make it to 
Parliament.  He has no realistic chance of winning the 
presidency, but he will have raised his own and his party\'s 
profile substantially). 
 
SMK: Closer to a Presidential Choice 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) Recent press reports indicate the Party of the 
Hungarian Coalition (SMK) will endorse KDH presidential 
candidate Frantisek Miklosko, which would boost his chances. 
(Comment: SMK supporters tend to follow voting 
recommendations from their party.)  If the run-off ends with 
Meciar and Schuster, SMK Secretary General Peter Voros and 
Spokeswoman Livia Pokstaller privately told us SMK would 
support Schuster.  They explained that party chair Bela 
Bugar and others sees the coalition problems as damaging 
Slovakia\'s stability and image abroad and discouraging 
investors.  They suggested the current ad-hoc assembly of 
support for the minority government is not a long-term 
solution for the coalition troubles. 
 
6. (SBU) SMK is very happy about the new Hungarian 
University in Komarno, which will give opportunities to 
ethnic Hungarians in southern Slovakia (but it is not 
running at full capacity yet).  The SMK leaders said Deputy 
Prime Minister Pal Csaky has been losing influence in SMK 
lately, is not very capable and is no longer supported by 
most SMK voters, as was the case in the past election term. 
But, they were pleasantly surprised by the successful 
outcome of Csaky\'s negotiations with KDH Justice Minister 
Daniel Lipsic that led to Cabinet approval of an anti- 
discrimination law. 
 
Slovak-Hungarian Agreement on Ethnic Minorities in Force 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
7. (SBU) The Slovak-Hungarian agreement on mutual support 
for ethnic minorities came into effect February 13 after 
some delays relating to administration of benefits to 
Slovaks in Hungary.  SMK spokesmen publicly opined in 
January that this would help the Kukan campaign among 
Hungarian voters.  But contacts have told poloffs there is 
still friction over the Hungarian Status law, which the GOS 
feels has extraterritorial and discriminatory elements.  The 
GOS would prefer that the Hungarians address all issues 
affecting the Hungarian minority in Slovakia through the 
existing bilateral agreement and reciprocal benefits for 
minorities in both countries. 
 
Sulovsky\'s Slovak National Party: We Are Not Extreme 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8. (SBU) Poloffs met with official Slovak National Party 
(SNS) Chairman Peter Sulovsky and Vice-chairman Viliam 
Oberhauser to discuss the party\'s plans and the recent 
conflict over leadership of the party (a court ruled in 
Sulovsky\'s favor, but Zilina mayor Jan Slota still claims to 
be the party\'s true leader).  Sulovsky is interested in 
moving away from the radical SNS Slota represents.  Sulovsky 
supports the EU, though cautioning the integration process 
should be slower; NATO accession is no longer an issue for 
this SNS.  He said the economic reforms are necessary, but 
the government should have assessed their impact better so 
as to prevent the current unrest.  Sulovsky said the 6 
percent of voters who indicate support for SNS in most polls 
mean his party, not Slota\'s.  He added that his party is 
more respected abroad and that his concept of a \"national 
party\" will become more important in the EU.  The SNS 
perceives the U.S. Republican Party as its ideological ally 
(as does Gasparovic).  SNS has not chosen a presidential 
candidate to support but is leaning toward Meciar.  SNS 
could work with most other parties, particularly KDH and 
even SMK, as he said even the Hungarian minority has the 
same economic concerns as everyone else.

SUBJECT: 2003 SPECIAL 301 REVIEW FOR SLOVAKIA 
 
REF: STATE 43420 
 
1.  Summary:  Slovakia has enacted nearly all of the 
intellectual property legislation required by TRIPS, and the 
overall IPR situation has improved from a historical 
perspective.  However, a lack of IPR protection for 
pharmaceuticals caused Slovakia to be placed on the Special 
301 Watch List in each of the past three years and there is 
little evidence that the situation has improved adequately. 
Problems related to general patent protection, especially 
data exclusivity, continue to be an issue because it is 
unclear which department of the GOS has responsibility. 
Piracy of optical and other visual medias remains minimal, 
but home \"burning\" of CD\'s has likely increased.  The 
Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the police have an 
independent office dedicated to computer-related crime. 
Although GOS offices and large companies predominantly use 
licensed software, experts say entrepreneurs and small- and 
medium-size enterprises continue to use pirated software. 
The sale of counterfeit trademarked goods is minimal.  Due 
to problems in the pharmaceutical area we recommend that 
Slovakia remain on the Watch List unless the GOS moves 
aggressively to address these issues before the 301 
decisions must be made.  End summary. 
 
TRIPS IMPLEMENTATION 
-------------------- 
2.  The Patent Law, the Commercial Code, the Law on 
Trademarks, the Law on Inventions, Industrial Design and 
Rationalization, the Law on Protection of Appellations of 
Origin of Products, and the Copyright Act, all implement 
Slovakia\'s TRIPS obligations.  The Civil and Penal Codes 
implement obligations with regard to enforcement.  TRIPS has 
been valid in Slovakia since 1995, but industry sources 
report that implementation and enforcement, despite some 
improvement, still remain problematic. 
 
3.  Slovak law remains problematic because it fails to 
harmonize data exclusivity with market authorization, and 
this raises potential conflicts with the country\'s WTO 
obligations.  Data exclusivity is drastically weakened 
because the GOS recognizes the date of first marketing 
authorization in any EU country as the start of the six-year 
period of protection in Slovakia, but does not accept the 
corresponding EU marketing authorization.  Since Slovak 
marketing authorization often takes two or three years 
longer than its EU equivalent, the six-year period of data 
exclusivity protection is drastically reduced.  In an effort 
to placate disgruntled industry members, in 2002 the GOS 
passed a law offering a 10-year period of data exclusivity 
for \"high technology\" drugs.  However, in 2003 the GOS 
returned to a six-year period of protection. 
 
4.  Foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to 
complain that the GOS allows competitors to sell drugs that 
are protected by valid patents.  Reportedly, the GOS has 
told the patent holders to sue the infringing companies 
directly, rather than getting involved itself or denying the 
guilty companies legal approval to sell the disputed drugs 
in the first place.  Industry sources complain that Slovak 
legislation is unclear and that GOS officials do not 
understand who has responsibility for enforcement of various 
laws, or even that patents are held on certain drugs. 
Currently, at least one foreign pharmaceutical 
manufacturer\'s infringement case is caught between two GOS 
offices that each say the other is responsible for the 
issue. 
 
5.  In 2002, Slovakia became a member of the EPO, acceding 
to all of the appropriate regulations, including the 
Convention on the Grant of European Patents and the Protocol 
on Centralization of the European Patent System.  According 
to Lubos Knoth at the Slovak Industrial Property Office 
(SIPO), Slovakia now provides European patents with the same 
level of protection as they enjoy in other EPO members. 
Moreover, licensed Slovak attorneys can now represent their 
customers in the EPO. 
 
OPTICAL MEDIA 
------------- 
6.  According to the Slovak Anti-Piracy Union (SAPU), the 
problem of video piracy has decreased significantly since 
2002.  The practice of video rental shops buying one legal 
copy of a video and then making several pirated copies, as 
well as the presence of pirated videos at flea markets, is 
now rare.  On the other hand, counterfeited DVD\'s, primarily 
of Ukrainian and Russian origin, have started to become more 
common. Efforts by the police, tax authorities and customs 
 
officers to monitor this situation have been commendable. 
According to a SAPU official, in 2003 up to 1,000 DVDs were 
seized and five or six individuals were arrested and put on 
probation for a period of 2 years.  Generally, Slovakia is a 
transit-and-target country rather than a producing nation, 
as it has no visual media pressing plants.  However, Sky 
Media, a Swiss company reportedly with Russian interests, 
plans to open Europe\'s largest CD-rom and DVD production 
facility in Slovakia later this year. 
 
7.  Although some progress has occurred in the area of music 
media, further improvement is essential. According to 
Slavomir Olsovsky from the International Federation of the 
Phonographic Industries (IFPI), legislation has been to a 
large extent harmonized, but enforcement is still lacking 
because of the insufficient skills and experience of police 
and customs officers.  A flea market in Eastern Slovakia\'s 
largest city, Kosice, was recently the site of a major 
police action, during which dozens of music CDs and other 
goods were confiscated, and forty people were arrested for 
selling illegal merchandise.  The number of home 
manufactured, or so-called \"burned\" CD\'s has likely climbed 
significantly due to the increasing penetration of personal 
computer copiers.  There are no industrial facilities to 
press pirated and/or counterfeited CD\'s in the country. 
 
COMPUTER SOFTWARE 
----------------- 
8.  Computer programs are protected as literary works, 
according to Section 7(1)a of the Copyright Act.  Use of 
unlicensed computer programs is a crime, which carries a 
sentence of up to five years in prison or a financial 
penalty. Since 2001, the Slovak Police Presidium has 
operated a special independent office dedicated to computer- 
related crime.  Generally, Slovakia is a consumer of pirated 
software but not a significant producer, and most of the 
pirated goods come from Ukraine, Russia and Poland. 
Problems persist regarding Slovakia\'s personal computer 
gaming clubs, which continue to violate computer licensing 
laws.  In 2003, Slovak police conducted raids at 12 Internet 
cafes in the city of Nitra, seizing 116 personal computers 
that contained illegal software. 
 
9.  According to industry experts, software piracy has 
noticeably decreased in Slovakia.  Microsoft\'s Bill Gates 
said during his visit to the country in January 2004, \"We 
have registered a decline in software piracy in Slovakia.\" 
Based on the Microsoft\'s Enterprise Agreement with the GOS 
signed in 2002, all copyrights of Microsoft software being 
used in the state administration have been purchased by 
Slovak authorities for a total of USD 13 million 
(representing a 65 percent discount on the regular price). 
In 2001, a similar agreement was signed between Microsoft 
and the Slovak Chamber of Physicians and in 2004, Slovakia 
joined Microsoft\'s worldwide project \"Partners in 
education.\" 
 
10.  In October 2003, the Slovak branch of the U.S. based 
Business Software Alliance (BSA) launched a nationwide 
campaign to fight illegal software.  Together with the 
police, the BSA sent out 100,000 letters to entrepreneurs 
reminding them that the use of unlicensed products was 
against the law.  Ads on local radio stations relayed the 
same message.  The International Planning and Research 
Corporation assigned Slovakia a piracy rate of 45 percent 
for 2002, the second lowest figure in the region, down from 
66 percent in 1994.  A 2003 study by BSA and the IDC Company 
suggested that if Slovakia reduced its software piracy rate 
by 10 percentage points, its IT sector could grow to nearly 
USD 1 billion annually by 2006, from USD 545 million in 
2002. 
 
TRADEMARKS 
---------- 
11.  Trips obligations on trademarks, bringing Slovakia into 
conformation with EU legislation, came into effect in 2002. 
In addition, Slovakia passed a law on customs measures 
regarding the import and export of illegal and counterfeit 
goods to comply with TRIPS articles dealing with customs and 
border control.  However, implementation is weak along the 
Ukrainian border, which is considered by experts to be an 
easy target for pirates. 
 
12.  An amendment to the Act on Trademarks came in effect on 
February 1, 2004, granting European \"community\" trademarks 
validity in Slovakia after its accession to the EU on May 1, 
2004.  Existing community trademarks will automatically be 
valid in the enlarged EU.  While the holders of existing 
 
national or international trademarks of similar appearance 
may not contest this automatic extension of existing 
community trademarks, they can protect their rights by 
applying for a ban on the use of existing similar community 
trademarks in Slovakia if their trademark was previously 
registered. In addition, commencing November 1, 2003, 
trademark holders can file objections to new applications 
for the registration of community trademarks of similar 
appearance. 
 
13.  According to sources, illegal use of trademarks is not 
perceived to be a significant problem in Slovakia.  The 
Customs Code makes it possible for Slovak Customs to seize 
counterfeited goods.  (NOTE: Previously, this authority was 
granted only to the trademark owner himself).  However, both 
customs and police are still not sufficiently trained 
regarding which trademarks are licensed in Slovakia. 
 
DESIGNS 
------- 
14. Protection of industrial designs by the 2002 Act on 
Designs, conforms to EU standards.  After accession to the 
EU, the protection afforded designs in existing member 
states will automatically apply in Slovakia, just as Slovak 
businesses will be able to take advantage of the same 
protection for their designs in the enlarged EU. 
 
DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN 
--------------------- 
15.  In the area of designation of origin, Slovak 
legislation (Act. 466/2003) conforms to Council Regulation 
(EC) No. 535/97 on the protection of geographical 
indications and designations of origin for agricultural 
products and foodstuffs. 
 
ENUMERATION LEGISLATION 
----------------------- 
16.  Compensation of enumeration is defined by the Copyright 
Act, which entered into effect on January 1, 2004.  The law 
imposes a six percent levy on all recording carriers such as 
CD\'s and video and audiotapes, and a three percent levy on 
all recording devices such as computers, video recorders, 
DVD players and other reprographic appliances.  Slovakia is 
the only country in Europe to also imposed a 0.5 percent 
levy on all hard discs in computers.  The proceeds from 
these levies go to industry rights holders, including 
foreign entities, although the exact amounts are difficult 
to calculate and vary according to bilateral and 
multilateral agreements.  For example, the Slovak Performing 
and Mechanical Rights Society (SOZA) is responsible for 
distributing compensation for U.S.-made music recordings to 
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. 
 
INTERNET PIRACY 
--------------- 
17.  In 2003, the SAPU, responsible for protection of movie 
industry rights, discovered 57 websites offering up to 700 
movie titles in the form of burned CDs in 2003.  SAPU has 
worked with the police in an effort to close down the 
websites and prosecute the administrators.  Most of the 
sites had operated on an order-only base (no titles in 
stock).  The BSA, responsible for monitoring software- 
related crime, reported that for the first time ever, an 
individual in Slovakia had received a sentence of one-year 
of probation for the crime of selling computer programs 
through the Internet. 
 
IPR ENFORCEMENT 
--------------- 
18.  According to the SIPO, Slovakia\'s TRIPS obligations are 
implemented through the Civil and Penal Codes.  The Slovak 
Customs Directorate is responsible for border enforcement, 
while the Slovak Police Presidium under the MOI is 
responsible for cases occurring within Slovakia.  The State 
Institute for Criminology has a department that specializes 
in determining whether goods are pirated or genuine.  Legal 
representatives of specialized organizations protecting 
intellectual property rights are often invited to assist in 
determining the size of damage and applying compensations. 
A lack of experience on the side of executing bodies still 
persists a major obstacle in IPR enforcement. 
 
19.  In 2003, police seized around 6,000 music CD\'s (in 
audio or MP3 format), the overwhelming majority of which 
were burned, not industrially produced.  This compares to 
7,500 CD\'s in 2002; 7,630 in 2001; 13,859 in 2000, and 
26,500 in 1999.  Experts partially blame the decline on 
police incompetence, but also admit that fewer people are 
 
purchasing pirated CD\'s as household \"burning\" becomes more 
common.  According to SAPU\'s statistics, in the area of 
movies, the police made 114 raids on flea markets during 
2003, and seized 467 videocassettes, 316 DVD\'s and 560 CD\'s 
with movie content. 
 
20.  In addition to enforcement, prosecution remains a 
problem.  Slovakia still has no specialized IPR prosecutors 
or police, there are no formal procedures or registrations 
required for lawyers seeking to adjudicate IPR cases, and 
punishment for IPR crimes remains inadequate.  If a pirate 
obtains a skilled lawyer, he can often be acquitted. 
Further, most pirates who are prosecuted receive light 
sentences, such as small fines or probation, although they 
can be sentenced for up to five years in prison in case of 
breaching copyright rights and up to three years in prison 
in case of violating industrial property rights.  To date, 
no persons convicted of piracy have served prison terms. 
 
21.  There are no dedicated courts for the adjudication of 
IPR cases in Slovakia.  However in 2003, the GOS established 
a panel of three judges to adjudicate IPR cases at three 
regional courts, in Banska Bystrica, Kosice and Bratislava. 
The Ministry of Justice, in cooperation with the SIPO, 
conducted intensive training of assigned judges on IPR and 
related issues. 
 
WCT AND WPPT COMPLIANCE 
----------------------- 
22.  Obligations from WIPO\'s Copyright Treaty (WCT) and 
WIPO\'s Performance and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) were 
implemented into the Slovak Copyright Act in 2000. Slovakia 
became party to WCT and WPPT in 2002.  Moreover, a new 
Copyright Law (618/2003), effective from January 1, 2004, 
has also been brought into compliance with Directive 
2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
22 May 2001 on the harmonization of certain aspects of 
copyright and related rights in the information society. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
23.  We do not believe piracy is a major problem in 
Slovakia.  Authorities have been generally cooperative with 
aggressive private sector efforts to combat piracy of 
various products protected by IPR legislation.  However, 
weak data exclusivity protection remains a major concern and 
we believe it warrants keeping Slovakia on the Special 301 
Watch List.  We are encouraged by Slovakia\'s membership in 
various international IPR organizations and hope it will 
lead to greater patent protection within the pharmaceutical 
industry.  If so, we would call for Slovakia to be removed 
from the Special 301 List in the future.  Post will continue 
to lobby hard for actual implementation of laws protecting 
patent information, and we urge USG officials to raise the 
importance of this issue with the Slovak embassy in 
Washington as well.

claimed that the recent events and police actions in 
Trebisov have diminished recent progress to improve 
relations between Roma and majority communities. End 
Summary. 
 
Police Contain Roma Looting 
---------------------------- 
 
2. On February 26 and 27 two embassy staff members traveled 
to the Presov and Spisska Nova Ves regions to meet with 
activists, city councilmen, and experts about the causes of 
the recent unrest in the Roma community. The area had 
relatively few incidents, but there was a noticeable police 
and media presence. After the arrival of additional police 
and military in Eastern Slovakia, Roma looting of grocery 
stores ceased. The last reported incident was on February 
25, the same day Roma leader Fizik called for a nation-wide 
strike against the recent welfare system. Small peaceful 
demonstrations occurred in some towns, but regional leaders 
appealed to Roma to call off the strike because of the 
volatile situation with the police. By February 27, 182 Roma 
(51 men, 96 women, and 35 minors) were accused of robbery or 
assaulting a police officer. In most cases, prosecutors 
requested pre-trial custody, which was granted in at least 
42 cases. The total estimated damage to equipment, goods, 
and property was 26,500 USD (847,000 SK). General Prosecutor 
Dobroslav Trnka opened an investigation into the statements 
of certain Roma politicians inciting the closure of borders 
and blockading highways as a method of protest. 
 
3. Plenipotentiary for Roma Affairs Klara Orgovanova 
expressed concern about the recent police action centered in 
Trebisov, the largest police deployment in Slovakia after 
the fall of communism. She stated her office received 
reports officers entered residences without warrants and 
complaints of police brutality, which she forwarded to the 
Ministry of Interior to investigate. Ingrid Zubkova, a Roma 
activist and education specialist from Trebisov, told pol 
staff she was not allowed to enter some areas heavily 
populated by Roma and some family and friends feared leaving 
their homes for work or school. As poloff joined several 
Roma activists celebrating a birthday over a bottle of 
champagne, masked police entered the bar to root out 
suspects involved in looting. Some Roma felt this regional 
\"show of force\" was excessive, however an increase in 
skinhead attacks targeting Roma that many feared would 
result did not occur. 
 
The Power of the Media 
---------------------- 
4. Roma activists stated that one of reasons why looting 
spread so quickly was the sensationalized reporting on 
television, the primary source of information in Roma 
settlements. Ed Conka, a local NGO leader in Levoca, stated 
he had observed a Czech television crew buying alcohol for 
several Roma who were later reacting with more vigor than 
others involved in a strike. The mayor of Levoca later 
accused the crew of inciting the protest; Ceska Televizia 
has responded by suing the mayor. The mayor of Bystrany 
stated the media reported that Roma broke into the local 
community center, but in reality they were playing soccer. 
Roma reporters Denisa Havrlova and Daniela Hivesova-Silanova 
from the monthly Romano Nevo Lil, accused their colleagues 
from the leading dailies during a recent press conference of 
contributing to the spread of the looting and ill feelings 
toward Roma. 
 
The Straw that Broke the Camel\'s Back 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. Roma councilmen from the Presov area told pol staff the 
outbreak of looting and unrest was spontaneous. They 
disavowed that politicians or usurers influenced events. 
Rather, they were a display of frustrations with the series 
 
of difficult reforms. The culmination of changes in health 
care payments, the institution of the 19 percent flat tax, 
and the welfare reform passed in a short time frame have 
severely affected the Roma community. 
 
6. The elected Roma leaders believed that neither local 
governments nor Roma communities were prepared for the 
monumental changes in the welfare system. A councilman from 
Jarovnice asked why government cuts could not have occurred 
more gradually to allow local offices to prepare for the 
institutional changes and allow Roma to adjust their 
household spending. The discussants spoke mostly about a new 
monetary bonus given for ten hours of community service a 
week, which local government and organizations will create 
jobs and assist qualified recipients to fill them. In areas 
with small Roma communities, all residents were offered this 
benefit.  However, for the citizens of Jarovnice, with a 
population of nearly 4,000 Roma, it is more complicated. 
Several municipalities contacted the local Roma entrepenuer, 
Jozef Patkan, known for his thriving businesses employing 
Roma, but he stated that there was more supply than demand. 
 
Nostalgia for Communism and Work 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. It was obvious that the dramatic transition over the last 
15 years to democracy and a market economy, so evident in 
Bratislava, has not taken hold in the East. The Roma 
councilmen were deeply disappointed with the current 
government and professed a deep longing to return to the 
simpler days of communism. They stated they wished to return 
to the days where you either went to work or to jail. 
According to noted sociologist Alexander Musinka, many 
politically active Roma with leadership positions on the 
local level have never held a job and have lived exclusively 
on welfare. He confirmed that these Roma will likely vote in 
the presidential elections for leftist candidates and in 
favor of the referendum on early elections. 
 
Looting Strains Race Relations 
------------------------------ 
 
8. Several activists relayed to embassy staff progress in 
the last few years in the Roma community, such as the 
election of several mayors and council members in the 2002 
local elections. Integrating Roma into the democratic 
process has not been smooth, but these officials have 
already done much for their communities. Bystrany, a city 
that is 80 percent Roma, elected both a Roma mayor and city 
council. After the election, the non-Roma population 
appealed to the Ministry of Interior because of fears that 
the newly elected officials did not have enough basic 
education. Following the recent events, the non-Roma 
population again began discussing whether the Roma mayor was 
competent. Roma activists and the media were refused access 
to a February 25 \"public\" meeting on this issue organized by 
non-Roma. Activists who initially felt the civil unrest 
could bring needed attention to the Roma problem conceded 
that it was actually very destructive. 
 
The Dual Face of Usurers 
------------------------ 
 
9. While the government placed some of the blame for the 
Roma unrest on usurers, Roma themselves described a 
different vision of usury\'s prevalence and influence. Some 
usurers were elected to positions in the city council and 
are well regarded for contributing to their community. Zehra 
city council members complained the mayor was not 
communicating with them. They were eagerly awaiting the 
return of the deputy mayor, who was on \"vacation,\" and was 
able to cooperate more effectively with the mayor. (We later 
learned that the deputy mayor was arrested for usury and was 
due to be released from jail in two weeks.) Social workers 
commented that while there are reports that usurers are 
highly influential and occasionally collaborate with the 
local police, not everyone in the community is beholden to 
usurers. Peter Polak, former Roma housing advisor to the 
district of Spisska Nova Ves, stated that usury is a by- 
product of the current economic situation, which will only 
be solved with further integration and employment for Roma. 
 
Roma Field Workers Fear Uncertain Future 
----------------------------------------- 
 
10. Nearly 50 social workers across Eastern and Southern 
Slovakia are currently employed through a pilot project 
operated by the Office of the Roma Plenipotentiary. The 
office directly employs 21 workers and foundations and 
international donors finance the remaining number. 
Throughout the past year, these workers gained trust in 
 
their communities, began education projects, and in some 
cases were the only means of communication between the Roma 
and the non-Roma citizens. In a small office in Velky Saris, 
Jozef Simonic, a coordinator for the workers, showed on a 
map the communities where the workers were engaged and where 
the looting occurred. He proudly commented that there were 
no problems in their communities and workers sought to 
manage the peaceful demonstrations. Simonic said he believed 
the government had adequate warning about the possible 
effects of the new benefit cuts, but the ministries and 
policy-makers suffer from not having enough knowledge about 
the Roma communities and not adequately coordinating 
policies through the Plenipotentiary\'s office. 
 
11. The Association of Social Workers and the Ministry of 
Labor (MOL) formed a working group to discuss guidelines for 
the workers and the future of the project. According to Roma 
Plenipotentiary Klara Orgovanova, the MOL agreed to transfer 
money to the municipalities to employ social workers, 
however delays may cause the project to run out of funding 
before the end of March and she can only continue funding a 
third of the staff. She is confident they will find a 
solution, but the Association may loose its trained 
employees due to new job qualifications and the inability of 
municipalities to pay for new positions. 
 
Comment 
-------- 
12. Our strongest impression after three days of traveling 
in eastern Slovakia was the extent to which most Roma 
communities have not participated in the economic or 
democratic transformation that occurred over the past 
fifteen years. Additionally, we noted a lack of mechanisms 
for communication between the two communities, with the 
exception of certain projects promoting field social work 
activity. There is no clear leadership behind which Roma can 
unite, and relying on sensationized TV coverage for 
information has proven to have disastrous results. The GOS 
speaks to Roma leaders that many claim have no constituents. 
 
13. We encouraged our interlocutors to explore new methods 
to get their message to policy-makers, such as more use of 
the growing Roma press and increased oversight efforts at 
the local level. We urged them to continue to build 
communication between Roma and non-Roma and to demand 
participation through peaceful means in decisions that 
affect them. The U.S. mission will continue to promote grass- 
roots democracy among Roma, and USAID\'s regional Roma 
project may also offer training on conflict resolution and 
other topics.

SUBJECT: Next President: Kukan, Schuster, or Meciar? 
 
 
1. Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
2. (U) Summary.  As the April 3 first round of presidential 
elections draw near, three candidates have emerged as the 
strongest: Foreign Minister and SDKU candidate Eduard Kukan; 
President Rudolf Schuster; and HZDS Chairman and former 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.  While politicians and polls 
indicate Kukan is the favorite in the first round with 26-27 
percent, Meciar has been gaining ground and Schuster is not 
so far behind.  Most Slovaks agree Meciar could make it to 
the second round, with the most likely scenario a replay of 
the 2002 Parliamentary elections where HZDS appeared strong 
but SDKU and its allies strengthened in the end when voters 
recalled the reality of Slovakia\'s isolation under Meciar in 
the 1990s.  The difference from 2002 is the lack of an NGO 
\"Get Out the Vote\" effort which, when combined with possible 
voter apathy and backlash against Kukan\'s SDKU party for 
recent economic and social reforms, could create an upset. 
End summary. 
 
Kukan Still Leads Polls 
----------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) With the elections a month away, polls show a more 
or less consistent level of support for each candidate, but 
a month is a long time in Slovak politics and in the mind of 
the Slovak voter.  Candidates have unofficially campaigned 
to various degrees but the two official campaign weeks 
immediately before the election will determine which two 
candidates pass to the April 17 second round.  There are 
three realistic possibilities for the second round: (in 
order of likelihood) Kukan vs. Meciar, Kukan vs. Schuster, 
or Schuster vs. Meciar.  In a February 11-17 Focus agency 
poll, of those who intended to vote, 27.5 percent favored 
Kukan, 23.1 percent supported Meciar, and 17.5 percent would 
vote for Schuster.  In an MVK poll published March 2, when 
asked whom they would support in a Kukan-Meciar runoff, 62.9 
percent chose Kukan and 37.1 percent selected Meciar. 
Virtually all contacts and voters to whom poloffs have 
spoken refer to each potential runoff as a \"lesser of two 
evils\" choice in which Kukan or Schuster would win against 
Meciar, with Kukan also likely to win over Schuster.  SDKU 
contacts have cited current poll results as reason enough 
Kukan will win, but the true campaigning has yet to begin. 
 
Meciar\'s Populism Has Enduring Appeal 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Meciar and HZDS still enjoy substantial popular 
support.  The party and the man remain indivisible 
politically and operationally.  Opposition MPs indicate many 
Slovaks are tired of crushing economic and social reforms 
and criticism from the EU and U.S., and they consider Meciar 
to be the only one who \"stands up\" for Slovakia.  But many 
agree that Meciar, despite changing his rhetoric to support 
EU integration and reform, still does not have enough 
sympathy among the public to win and is not considered a 
vote for change, as much as voters may dislike their 
economic situation. 
 
Schuster\'s Support Unclear 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Schuster may end up with Smer\'s endorsement, as its 
chairman Robert Fico has said positive things about Schuster 
in the media and would be unlikely to support archrival 
Meciar or coalition candidate Kukan.  However, Schuster 
seems to have lost the labor unions to Meciar. 
 
6. (SBU) Opposition politicians have told poloffs Kukan\'s 
poll numbers seem high considering his closeness to PM 
Dzurinda and public discontent over economic reforms that 
took place en masse at the beginning of this year.  However, 
there are many layers between personalities and policy, and 
many observers doubt party affiliation or support has the 
same strong effect as in parliamentary elections.  Thus, 
voters are unlikely to make this connection between the 
actions of the SDKU-led coalition and Kukan himself.  For 
example, in the 1992 Parliamentary elections, voters 
supported a united Czechoslovakia yet voted for Meciar, 
whose goal was a separate Slovak state. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) Meciar, if he gets to the second round, will appeal 
to labor unions, nationalists, and his traditional 
supporters.  (Even Kukan\'s own campaign manager admitted 
privately that his family in eastern Slovakia would vote for 
no one but Meciar.)  Meciar may also benefit from the 
widespread discontent of Roma and other socially and 
economically disadvantaged citizens, who are angry at the 
 
government and so will vote against Kukan, the \"government 
candidate\".  A vote \"against\" could combine with apathy 
resulting in a low turnout which could create an upset. 
 
8. (SBU) Political analysts close to the Embassy believe 
those who strongly oppose Meciar and would come out 
specifically to vote against him outnumber his strong 
supporters, making the prospect of a Meciar victory possible 
but unlikely at this point.  One respected pollster opined 
in the media that Meciar could win only if turnout is very 
low. 
 
9.  (SBU) The possibility of a Meciar victory raises the 
question of a U.S. response.  We took an active, albeit 
nuanced, approach to his candidacy in 2002, including a 
major nonpartisan GOTV effort.  No one was in doubt as to 
our position, which was a topic of great interest in 
Slovakia.  So far, our position in 2004 has not been a 
subject of inquiry, public or private.  It would be 
premature at this juncture for us to engage.  Doing so in 
the current political climate might possibly enhance his 
attractiveness to some voters.  If he gets to the second 
round, we will then want to consider his electoral prospects 
and decide how to react.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: FOREIGN INVESTORS DISCOVER SLOVAKIA 
 
 
1.  Summary. Seemingly, hardly a day has gone by this year 
without the announcement of new foreign direct investment 
(FDI) in Slovakia.  The Dzurinda government has transformed 
Slovakia\'s once troubled economy into a business friendly 
state that leads the region in economic growth.  The 
country\'s low-cost yet skilled labor force, low taxes, 
liberal labor code and favorable geographical location have 
helped it become one of Europe\'s favorite investment 
markets.  As a result, Slovakia has increased its level of 
cumulative FDI by five-fold since the beginning of 2000. 
American companies are represented in a wide variety of 
industries in Slovakia and their investments have grown 
sharply in recent years to help make the U.S. Slovakia\'s 
third largest foreign investor.  End summary. 
 
CARS 
---- 
2.  On March 2, Hyundai, the world\'s seventh-largest 
carmaker, selected Slovakia as the site of its first 
European production plant.  Hyundai will invest USD 870 
million in the new facility, which will produce 200,000 cars 
per year and create 2,400 jobs.  Production will start by 
the end of 2006.  Slovakia won the deal in a long-running 
contest with Poland, its second consecutive triumph over its 
larger neighbor.  Last year, Peugeot, Europe\'s second 
leading car company, also selected Slovakia over Poland for 
a new plant roughly the same size as Hyundai\'s. (NOTE: 
Peugeot plant should launch production by 2006 with an 
output of 300,000 vehicles a year.) 
 
3.  As a result of these automotive investments, Slovakia 
has been dubbed \"Little Detroit\" by the foreign press.  In 
addition to Hyundai and Peugeot, the country is home to 
Europe\'s largest carmaker Volkswagen, which produced 280,000 
cars last year.  By 2007, the combined annual production of 
all three carmakers in Slovakia is projected to be at least 
850,000 vehicles.  At that level, Slovakia would have the 
world\'s largest auto production per capita.  In addition, 
Rover MG (UK), Honda and Mazda are also considering 
investments in Slovakia, as is America\'s specialty vehicle 
manufacturer International Truck and Engine Corp. 
 
CAR COMPONENTS 
-------------- 
4.  Hyundai reported that seven or eight of its component 
suppliers plan to follow it to Slovakia, and American auto 
parts suppliers Dura, Tower, Johnson Controls, Delphi, Lear, 
and Molex are already manufacturing here.  Others, such as 
the U.S.-based Visteon and Arvin Meritor and the world\'s 
largest tire maker, Bridgestone of Japan, are also 
considering investments in Slovakia.  Recently, German car 
components maker, Hoernlein, announced an investment of an 
unspecified amount in Southern Slovakia.  The company, which 
plans to launch production by year-end, will hire 120 people 
in an area with an unemployment rate of 20 percent. 
 
CHEMICALS 
--------- 
5.  One of the world\'s largest plastics producers, Germany\'s 
Mannesmann Plastics, announced it would invest USD 37.5 
million for a green-field factory in Slovakia.  It will 
start production in 2005 and create 150 jobs.  American 
plastic bottle maker, Plastipak Packaging, announced plans 
to build a USD 30 million facility to produce and recycle 
plastic bottles in Eastern Slovakia, providing 100 jobs in 
the first stage alone.  Yet another investment, by the Swiss 
glass company Glas Troesch AG, worth USD 230 million should 
lead to an additional 300 to 400 new jobs. 
 
ELECTRONICS 
----------- 
6.  Swiss recordable media producer Sky Media selected 
Slovakia over bids from Ireland and Germany as the site for 
its new USD 127 million plant that will provide 1,000 jobs. 
Its planned output will make it the largest CD-rom and DVD 
production facility in Europe and the fourth largest 
worldwide.  Samsung, the world\'s second-largest 
semiconductor maker, is closing a plant in Spain and 
shifting production of TV sets to Slovakia, creating 1,000 
more jobs.  It is also considering building a new home 
appliances factory in the country.  Samsung\'s move has 
attracted its supplier, Dong Jin Precision, to build a plant 
in Southern Slovakia worth USD 8.1 million that will lead to 
350 new employees. 
 
REAL ESTATE 
 
----------- 
7.  Heitman, a leading U.S. real estate company, has 
established a joint venture with Israel\'s Engel General 
Developers Ltd., and will spend USD 300 million on 
apartments and houses in Central Europe, including Slovakia. 
In addition, a consortium including the DB Real Estate 
Global Opportunities Fund, a member of Deutsche Bank, and 
Czech developer, Discovery Group, will invest USD 37.5 
million over the next two years in a shopping and 
entertainment center in Western Slovakia. 
 
OTHER 
------ 
8.  Swedish furniture-maker Swedwood, part of the IKEA 
group, will invest up to USD 60 million to expand three of 
its four plants in Slovakia.  Canada\'s Rockport Homes will 
invest USD 56 million to build four factories to produce low- 
cost reinforced concrete homes, and each factory will 
provide 200 jobs.  Finally, America\'s Kraft Foods recently 
announced that it was closing its plant in Hungary and 
shifting production to Slovakia and Austria. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9.  Prospects have never been brighter for FDI in Slovakia. 
The country has forged a reputation for high quality 
production, low costs and enhanced profitability.  On the 
way, Slovakia has learned to successfully compete with its 
neighboring countries that once dominated it in attracting 
FDI.  Furthermore, it has been able to attract business away 
from Asian and Western European markets.  Privatization was 
the driving force of FDI in the past, but now green field 
projects dominate the inflow of FDI.  Economy Minister Pavol 
Rusko expects FDI to reach USD 2.5 billion per year between 
2004 and 2006 and we have no reason to doubt him.  Slovakia 
has successfully overcome a late start in attracting FDI due 
to the poor business environment that existed prior to the 
election of the Dzurinda government in 1998.  American 
companies have made important contributions to the Slovak 
economy both in terms of the quantity of their investments 
and their practice of good corporate citizenship.  Post has 
contributed to this movement by hosting two large business 
conferences and is currently in the process of planning a 
third.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, LO 
SUBJECT: NEW LAW ON PROTECTION OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  ON MARCH 11, THE SLOVAK PARLIAMENT APPROVED 
A NEW 48-PAGE LAW ON PROTECTION OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. 132 
OUT OF 136 PRESENT DEPUTIES VOTED FOR THE BILL.  WHILE THE NEW 
LAW REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXEMPTED FROM SECURITY 
CLEARANCES, THE EXEMPTION OF ALL 150 MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND 
    1200 JUDGES MAY STILL BE TOO BROAD TO MEET NATO REQUIREMENTS. 
THE LAW FURTHER CLARIFIES THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE VARIOUS 
SERVICES INVOLVED IN THE SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS.  THE LAW 
ALSO SPECIFIES THE ROLE PARLIAMENT WILL HAVE IN SELECTING 
FUTURE DIRECTORS OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICE (NBU) AND 
CREATES AN APPEAL PROCESS FOR THOSE DENIED CLEARANCES. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) THE NBU CONTINUES TO BE THE PRIMARY OFFICE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR ENSURING THE SECURITY OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN 
SLOVAKIA.  THE NBU WILL ALSO GRANT SECURITY CLEARANCES TO MOST 
GOS EMPLOYEES WHO REQUIRE THEM.  THE SLOVAK INFORMATION 
SERVICE (SIS), MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (VOS), AND THE 
POLICE CORPS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR GRANTING SECURITY 
CLEARANCES TO THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO WORK 
FOR THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. 
 
3. (U) THE NEW LAW HAS REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXEMPT 
FROM SECURITY CLEARANCES, BUT EXPERTS SAY IT IS STILL TOO HIGH 
AND MAY NOT MEET NATO REQUIREMENTS.  PEOPLE WHO FILL THE 
FOLLOWING POSTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON 
A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS AND WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A 
SECURITY CLEARANCE: THE PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER AND JUSTICES 
OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (13), MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT (150), 
CABINET MEMBERS (16), CHAIRMAN AND VICE-CHAIRMEN OF THE 
SUPREME AUDIT OFFICE, AND ALL JUDGES EXCEPT JUDGES OF THE 
SPECIAL COURT (APPROX. 1,200).  THE PREVIOUS LAW ALSO EXEMPTED 
PROSECUTORS AND MAYORS; THEY WILL HAVE TO UNDERGO SECURITY 
SCREENING IN THE FUTURE. 
 
4. (U) THE NEW LAW ALSO PROHIBITS ANYONE WHO WORKED FOR THE 
    COMMUNIST-ERA SECRET POLICE (STB) ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED 
INFORMATION.  INTERIOR MINISTER VLADIMIR PALKO TOLD PRESS, 
\"THE LAW MARKS THE END OF THE LAST STAGE OF PURGING THE 
SECURITY FORCES OF FORMER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNIST STB.\"  THE 
LAW DOES PERMIT A PERSON WHO WORKED FOR THE STB, BUT NOW IS 
ONE OF THE EXCEPTIONS LISTED IN PARA 3, ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED 
INFORMATION. 
 
5. (U) UNDER THE NEW LAW, THE CABINET WILL PROPOSE THE FUTURE 
NBU DIRECTOR AND PARLIAMENT WILL APPROVE THE PROPOSAL.  THE 
NBU DIRECTOR WILL SERVE FOR A TERM OF SEVEN YEARS AND CANNOT 
SERVE MORE THAN TWO TERMS.  THE NBU DIRECTOR CAN BE RECALLED 
UPON REQUEST OF 30 MPS OR THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
6. (U) THE LAW PROVIDES FOR AN APPEAL PROCESS OF AN NBU 
DECISION.  PARLIAMENT WILL ELECT AN ELEVEN-MEMBER APPEAL 
COMMITTEE THAT IS PROPORTIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL PARTIES 
IN PARLIAMENT. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT: THE NEW LAW IS A COMPROMISE, BUT IT DOES 
IMPROVE THE PREVIOUS LAW.  IT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT GRANTING 
NATO CLEARANCES IS A MORE TRANSPARENT PROCESS.  HOWEVER, THE 
INCLUSION OF EVERY MP AND JUDGE IN THE LIST OF \"EXCEPTIONS\" IS 
A MAJOR WEAKNESS.  THE PRESIDENT NOW HAS 15 DAYS TO SIGN THE 
BILL INTO LAW OR RETURN IT TO PARLIAMENT.  WE EXPECT THAT HE 
WILL SIGN THE LAW.

TAGS: PGOV, PINR, LO 
SUBJECT: AN UPDATED SNAPSHOT OF PM DZURINDA 
 
REF: BRATISLAVA 161 
 
Classified By: Amb. Ronald Weiser for reasons 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (C) Summary/Introduction.  With increased opportunities 
to engage Prime Minister Dzurinda and the GOS during the NATO 
accession event at the White House on March 29, the FM 
informal in Brussels on April 2, and the Instanbul Summit, 
post offers an updated snapshot of the Prime Minister and his 
relations with coalition partners.  During the autumn of 
2003, Dzurinda created considerable friction within the 
ruling coalition when he fired National Security Office 
Director Mojzis and Defense Minister Simko after losing 
confidence in them.  As a result, Dzurinda now heads a 
minority government because Simko left Dzurinda\'s party, 
taking six other deputies with him.  Since Simko\'s departure, 
however, Dzurinda has returned to his consultative approach 
with ANO, the Christian Democratic Movement, and the 
Hungarian Coalition Party.  The Prime Minister discussed his 
actions with the Ambassador several times last autumn and 
provided, from his viewpoint and in the Ambassador\'s opinion, 
reasonable political justification for his actions, although 
the methods the PM used were illconceived in implementing his 
agenda.  Poor tactics aside, Dzurinda remains strongly 
committed to reform and continues to move Slovakia away from 
the flagrant subversion of democratic norms and institutions 
that flourished under former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. 
End Summary/Introduction. 
 
Reacting Out of Anger 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Last fall, Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda hit 
probably the lowest point of his political career.  In 
August, the press announced that the PM had named a 
\"skupinka\" or small group of people who were destabilizing 
the Slovak state.  While Smer MP Robert Kalinak named the 
PM\'s so-called skupinka, Dzurinda never publicly confirmed or 
denied Kalinak\'s list.  However, the skupinka acted as a 
catalyst for several events, including the removal of 
National Security Office chief Jan Mojzis and Defense 
Minister Ivan Simko.  (See reftel)  During the late summer 
and early fall, Dzurinda appeared to be lashing out at those 
whom he perceived as enemies, including the press, reacting 
with anger rather than with his usual conciliatory approach. 
Even Dzurinda would likely admit now that he handled the 
situation poorly, temporarily damaging public and 
international perception of his leadership and Slovakia. 
Prior to these events, the PM had earned the reputation of 
being a skillful negotiator who had mastered Slovakia\'s 
political minefields, able to build compromises among 
unlikely, and frequently clashing, political parties. 
According to some coalition politicians, Dzurinda allegedly 
felt that since this coalition was ideologically closer than 
the one he headed in his first term, he could push government 
personnel decisions onto his coalition partners without his 
usual behind-the-scenes negotiations.  They resented this 
treatment, expecting to be consulted as in the past. 
 
Thin-skinned Prime Minister 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The skupinka event also highlighted that Dzurinda 
does not accept criticism graciously.  A disillusioned 
founder of SDKU remarked to emboff that the PM particularly 
dislikes being told what he has to do, whether it is by a 
coalition member, an advisor, or another country.  Between 
August and October, Dzurinda reacted poorly to criticism from 
within his party as well as from his coalition partners, 
which eventually led to the creation of Ivan Simko\'s 
breakaway Free Forum. 
 
Loyalty or Betrayal 
------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Dzurinda\'s expectation of loyalty and his strong 
emotional reaction to perceived betrayal influenced his 
decisions.  Dzurinda was angry with Mojzis because the NBU 
Director had been indiscreetly critical of the PM on numerous 
occasions, and those remarks made it back to Dzurinda, 
resulting in a power struggle that Dzurinda was determined to 
win.  Dzurinda told the Ambassador that he felt forced to 
sack Defense Minister Simko because he would not vote with 
Dzurinda in removing Mojzis.  Dzurinda said that he had to 
remove Simko in order to maintain party discipline and 
coalition loyalty because Simko was his appointee to the 
SDKU-designated post.  Dzurinda, however failed to adequately 
 
convince his coalition partners of the reasons why he lost 
confidence in Mojzis and therefore he appeared to be forcing 
personnel decisions onto the coalition without consultation. 
In doing so, he temporarily tarnished Slovakia\'s 
international image. 
 
A Return to Normalcy 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C) During the last several months, Dzurinda has 
solidified the relationship with ANO, and to a lesser extent 
mended fences with the Hungarian Coalition Party (SMK), the 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), and his own Slovak 
Democratic and Christian Union (SDKU).  He has subsequently 
tread more carefully in making decisions, consulting with his 
partners quietly.  We note that the appointment of NBU Chief 
Aurel Ugor was handled with no major accusations from 
coalition or opposition members.  More importantly, Dzurinda 
did not \"win\" with this appointment because of his agreement 
not to appoint a new head withough the coalition\'s approval. 
 
Still Committed to Reform 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Despite the hiccup last fall, Dzurinda remains 
committed to continuing the reform process, although at times 
slowly.  His campaign pledge to root out corruption has only 
a few big name arrests, primarily from opposition parties. 
The almost dysfunctional judicial system is being reformed 
slowly, but it still hampers the anti-corruption campaign. 
Since 1998, when Dzurinda was first elected, he has 
dismantled the structure that his predecessor, Vladimir 
Meciar, created to steal from the government.  In addition, 
the KDH Ministers of Justice and Interior act as a system of 
checks and balances, having made significant steps in the 
fight against corruption and retooling the judicial system. 
Under Dzurinda\'s watch, the Slovak Information Service 
recently has been purged of all former employees of the 
communist-era intelligence agency including those purported 
to be responsible for last year\'s wiretapping scandal. 
 
The Necessity of Personal Politics 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The personality conflicts from last fall appear to be 
behind Dzurinda, but the highly personalized nature of 
politics will remain.  Emboffs constantly are reminded how 
small the leadership elite continues to be as everyone knows 
each other, either from university days or through family 
connections.  Dzurinda\'s government, and subsequent prime 
ministers, will most probably continue to operate within a 
style of cronyism that remains a legacy from communism.  Most 
Slovaks feel, whether it concerns national politics or a 
simple business transaction like buying flowers, one relies 
on personal connections rather than institutions.  On the 
positive side, Dzurinda\'s government has enacted many laws 
and regulations to reduce cronyism and to increase 
transparency in government. 
 
Prospects for Working with Partners 
----------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Dzurinda has returned to his more customary approach 
of consultations before announcing government decisions.  In 
conversations with Slovak interlocutors, many have remarked 
that the PM has learned his lesson.  The referendum calling 
for new elections and his lack of parliamentary majority will 
keep Dzurinda focused on coalition health.  Poor tactics 
aside, Dzurinda remains strongly committed to reform and 
continues to move Slovakia away from the flagrant subversion 
of democratic norms and institutions that flourished under 
former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.

SUBJECT: Bratislava II: A Carrot for Balkans and Caucasus 
 
1.  Introduction: Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda hosted a 
conference March 19 under the banner \"Towards A Wider 
Europe: The New Agenda.\"  With most Visegrad-4 and Vilnius- 
10 countries moments away from full membership in both NATO 
and the EU, the conference focused on how to expand the 
process of transformation to additional countries, 
particularly in the Balkans and Caucasus.  Panelists 
stressed the need for continued reform and the highly- 
motivating factor of eventual EU and NATO membership.  A 
common theme was the need to work together to overcome the 
global threat of terrorism.  More information about the 
conference, including the full text of most speeches and the 
concluding statement, can be found on the website 
www.wena.sk. 
 
The Panels 
---------- 
2. Panel One: The Balkan Democracies and the Challenges of 
European Integration.  Carl Bildt, former Prime Minister of 
Sweden, moderated a panel consisting of Albanian PM Fatos 
Nano, Croation PM Ivo Sanader, Macedonian PM Branko 
Crvenkovski, Montenegrin PM Milo Djukanovic, Serbian PM 
Vojislav Kostunica, Bosnian FM Mladen Ivanic, and Finnish FM 
Erkki Tuomioja.  The speakers campaigned for timely NATO and 
EU talks towards their accession.  Each state pointed to its 
democratic improvements and regional cooperation.  All 
supported one another\'s bids towards accession.  Sanader 
alone presented Croatia as progressing faster than its 
neighbors.  Tuomioja, speaking for the EU, argued that these 
states continued to make progress towards democratization 
and regional stability, but that EU and NATO must see 
significant additional advances before they offer membership 
to any Balkan country. 
 
3. Panel Two: Europe\'s Black Sea and Caucasus Neighborhood. 
Panelists were Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, Azeri 
President Ilham Aliyev, Romanian PM Adrian Nastase, 
Bulgarian FM Solomon Passy, and Armenian FM Vartan Oskanian. 
The discussion revolved around the treatment of these 
countries by the soon to be enlarged EU, assistance for the 
region to fully encompass democratic principles, and the 
potential for inclusion in the EU.  All the panelists agreed 
that integration into the EU and adoption of the wider 
European policy was important for their countries\' future. 
However, they also mentioned continuing problems and 
stressed their concerns with lack of stability, internal 
conflicts, and each country\'s individual nature.  These 
problems were most explicitly highlighted during the 
interchange between President Aliyev and FM Oskanian. 
Although the overall attitude and themes presented during 
the discussion were positive, both leaders used this forum 
to showcase their opinions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict 
and requested international attention to facilitate 
resolution. 
 
4. EUR DAS Robert Bradtke, a member of the US delegation, 
made points from the floor: 
--the U.S. supports the aspirations of these countries to 
join transatlantic structions, wants them to succeed, and 
will help; 
--they will be judged both individually and on how well they 
cooperate with each other and with NATO; 
--progress in rule of law, anti-corruption, and human rights 
is essential; 
--defense reform is necessary so the countries are producers 
and not consumers of military resources; 
--the new member states must lead by example, because future 
expansion will be judged by how well the newest members do. 
 
5. Panel Three: The Problems and Promise of a Wider Europe. 
The third panel included Lithuanian PM Algirdas Brazauskas, 
U.S. National Security Council\'s Dan Fried, Latvian PM 
Indulis Emsis, Estonian PM Juhan Parts, Slovenian FM Dmitrij 
Rupel, and Norwegian FM Jan Petersen.  All expressed the 
view that today\'s Europe is defined by two institutions, EU 
and NATO.  Fried said that the EU and NATO were sources of 
stability and prosperity for their members, and were magnets 
for other countries seeking entry.  He elaborated on the 
three main problems that European institutions must address 
during the expansion process: 1) divisions within Europe 
itself; 2) sustaining the drive for democracy in countries 
such as Georgia and Ukraine; and 3) threats beyond Europe 
including terrorism, failed states, and dictators.  The 
other panelists made similar points. 
 
6. Panel Four: Views from the European Union, NATO, and the 
United States.  Slovak FM Eduard Kukan introduced the 
speakers: NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, EU 
Commissioner for Enlargement Gunter Verheugen, and U.S. 
Senator Trent Lott (R-Mississippi).  All three emphasized 
the need for continued democratic reforms, and encouraged 
Balkans and Caucasus countries to look at the new member 
states as examples to follow.  Verheugen said \"union\" was 
more than common customs fees, but meant peace, stability, 
and prosperity for all citizens.  Lott stressed the common 
 
history and values shared by Europe and the U.S. and said 
that by remaining united we can meet any challenge, 
particularly the top priority of defeating terrorism. 
 
Concluding Statement Supports Further Expansion 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
7. In his closing remarks, FM Eduard Kukan hoped everyone 
had been inspired by the conference.  He said it had been 
successful for four reasons: 
a. good attendance 
b. good format, with participation by NGO\'s, governments, 
and legislators 
c. good timing, as the attacks in Madrid re-focused 
attention on the terrorist threat; while the discussion 
preceded EU enlargement and the NATO Istanbul summit 
d. good discussion/content. 
Many tough issues remain, but many good ideas are being 
generated to deal with them. 
 
8.  Upon the conclusion of the conference, the V-10 Prime 
Ministers issued a statement which welcomed the achievements 
and encouraged further progress towards Euro-Atlantic 
standards and integration taking place in the Western 
Balkans, South Caucasus and Black Sea Region, Ukraine and 
Turkey. They promised to actively support truly democratic 
ambitions, share experience and work within Euro-Atlantic 
institutions to make sure that no European democracy is left 
outside Europe\'s institutions.  They renewed their 
commitment to fighting terrorism. 
 
NGO Pre-Conference 
------------------ 
9. More than 120 NGO and think tank experts from 30 
countries met March 18 before the \"Bratislava II\" 
conference.  Four panels discussed new political and 
security challenges, such as EU and NATO relationships with 
Eastern and Southern Europe, security in the Black Sea 
region, and the role and responsibilities of the new NATO 
and EU member states in wider European affairs. Among the 
panelists were Jamie Shea (NATO), Eric van der Linden (EC), 
Erhard Busek (Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe), 
Jaques Rupnik (Center for International Research and 
Studies), Bruce Jackson (Project on Transitional 
Democracies), representatives from Bulgaria, Romania, 
Georgia, Moldova, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Ukraine, 
Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia.  The pre-conference 
was organized by the German Marshall Fund of the United 
States in co-operation with the Institute for Public Affairs 
- Slovakia and the Slovak Foreign Policy Association.

    MEMBERS 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  DURING A CONFERENCE IN BRATISLAVA LAST WEEK, 
FINANCE MINISTERS FROM SIX EU ACCESSION STATES CALLED ON 
CURRENT EU MEMBERS TO FIND THE POLITICAL WILL TO UNDERTAKE 
STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN THEIR OWN AGRICULTURE SECTORS, PENSION 
AND TAX SYSTEMS.  THE MINISTERS ALSO URGED MEMBER STATES NOT 
TO REDUCE TRANSFER PAYMENTS TO ACCESSION STATES, AND 
CRITICIZED FRANCE AND GERMANY FOR BREACHING FISCAL DEFICIT 
CEILING RULES UNDER THE EU\'S STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT.  THE 
TWO-DAY CONFERENCE, \"ECONOMIC REFORMS FOR EUROPE,\" FEATURED 
SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM SLOVAKIA, THE CZECH REPUBLIC, 
SLOVENIA, LATVIA, POLAND AND MALTA, AS WELL AS AUTHORITIES 
FROM THE WORLD BANK, THE OECD AND THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT 
BANK.  PARTICIPANTS PRAISED SLOVAKIA FOR ITS RECENTLY 
ESTABLISHED FLAT RATE TAX SYSTEM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  DURING THE MARCH 18-19 CONFERENCE, SLOVAK FINANCE 
MINISTER IVAN MIKLOS CRITICIZED THE EU FOR FOOT-DRAGGING AND 
SAID HE HOPED ENLARGEMENT WOULD \"DEEPEN AND SPEED UP 
STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN CURRENT EU STATES,\" THOUGH HE REMAINED 
SKEPTICAL MUCH WOULD CHANGE.  SLOVENIAN FINANCE MINISTER 
DUSAN MRAMOR CRITICIZED THE EU`S COMMON AGRICULTURE POLICY, 
WHICH HE SAID \"FORCED EU MEMBERS TO SPEND EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS 
OF MONEY ON FARM SUBSIDIES, INSTEAD OF PROGRAMS OF THEIR OWN 
CHOICE.\" 
 
3.  THE DELEGATES URGED THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO RESIST 
PRESSURE FROM GERMANY, FRANCE, THE UK, THE NETHERLANDS, 
SWEDEN AND AUSTRIA TO LOWER TRANSFER PAYMENTS FROM THE 
CURRENT LEVEL OF 1.24 PERCENT OF GROSS NATIONAL INCOME TO 
    1.0 PERCENT FOR THE PERIOD OF 2007 TO 2013.  FURTHERMORE, 
THEY VOICED DISAPPOINTMENT WITH FRANCE AND GERMANY FOR 
FAILING MAINTAIN FISCAL DEFICITS WITHIN THE STABILITY AND 
GROWTH PACT\'S LIMIT OF THREE PERCENT OF GDP.  MIKLOS 
EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS FRUSTRATING TO UNDERGO PAINFUL REFORMS 
IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE EURO ZONE WHEN 
CURRENT MEMBERS IGNORED THE RULES.  MOST INCOMING EU 
MEMBERS, SAID THEY INTENDED TO STAY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN 
EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM (ERM-2), A WAITING ROOM FOR EURO 
ADOPTION, FOR ONLY THE MINIMUM TWO-YEAR PERIOD.  THEY FELT

4.  SLOVAKIA RECEIVED WIDE PRAISE DURING THE CONFERENCE FOR 
ITS RECENTLY ADOPTED REFORMS, PARTICULARLY ITS TAX SYSTEM 
OVERHAUL THAT ESTABLISHED A 19 PERCENT FLAT RATE FOR 
PERSONAL AND CORPORATE TAXES AS WELL AS VAT, AND ELIMINATED 
WITHHOLDING TAXES ON DIVIDENDS.  POLISH FINANCE MINISTER 
ANDRZEJ RACZKO SAID IT WOULD BE GREAT IF ALL 25 FUTURE EU 
MEMBERS COULD FOLLOW SLOVAKIA\'S EXAMPLE.  U.S. TAX POLICY 
EXPERT DANIEL MITCHELL OF THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION ADDED THAT 
THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL EUROPE HAD CHANGED HISTORY BY 
PURSUING TAX POLICIES THAT FUELED ECONOMIC GROWTH.  THE 
OECD\'S TAX EXPERT JEFFREY OWENS STRESSED THE SLOVAK SYSTEM 
WAS NOT ONLY ADVANTAGEOUS IN TERMS OF LOW INCOME TAXES, BUT 
ALSO EASY, FAIR AND NON-DISCRIMINATING.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, LO 
SUBJECT: GASPAROVIC\'S CHANCES 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald Weiser for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  Presidential candidate Ivan Gasparovic may 
get a slight boost from the recent endorsement by top-polling 
political party Smer.  On the other hand, Slovaks are likely 
to vote for the person they like best, and party endorsement 
will most probably not mean much.  The 25-30 percent support 
in polls for Smer leader Robert Fico will probably translate 
into only a few percentage points of support for Gasparovic. 
Although polls have shown rising support for Gasparovic, and 
he has overtaken incumbent Rudolf Schuster, he is still in 
third place, which will leave him out of the runoff. 
Political observers in Slovakia remain certain that the April 
17 runoff will be FM Eduard Kukan versus HZDS leader Vladimir 
Meciar.  End summary. 
 
Smer Supports Gasparovic 
------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) Smer chairman Robert Fico surprised many on March 15 
when he endorsed Ivan Gasparovic for president.  Smer 
consistently tops the polls with 25 to 30 percent voter 
preference.  However, support for Fico and Smer does not 
necessarily translate to support for Gasparovic, even among 
undecided voters. 
 
3. (C) Speculation abounds about Fico\'s motives.  Clearly an 
opposition party could not support coalition leader SDKU\'s 
candidate, Eduard Kukan.  Many Smer leaders have a visceral 
dislike of rival opposition party HZDS\'s chairman, Vladimir 
Meciar.  Initially it seemed certain that Smer would support 
populist incumbent Rudolf Schuster, especially after he 
scheduled the Smer-supported referendum on early 
Parliamentary elections on the same day as the presidential 
election.  The tactical reason for the switch may have been 
that Fico felt Schuster, with no political party of his own, 
had nothing to deliver in return (in future Parliamentary 
elections). 
 
Background on Gasparovic 
------------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) Gasparovic is the chairman of Movement for Democracy 
(HZD), which split from HZDS in July 2002 after Meciar did 
not include Gasparovic on the HZDS candidate list for that 
year\'s Parliamentary elections.  HZD did not reach the 
five-percent threshold to have members in Parliament.  In a 
recent discussion with poloffs, Gasparovic acknowledged that 
his chances for making it to the second round of the 
presidential election were slim.  Gasparovic expects his 
candidacy to bring more interested voters to his party, 
re-energizing it for the next Parliamentary election. 
 
5. (SBU) Besides Smer, Gasparovic supporters include leaders 
of the Jan Slota strand of the Slovak National Party, HZDS 
breakaway party People\'s Union (LU), and Slovak National 
Union (SNJ).  Factors that may contribute to Gasparovic\'s 
appeal include his once high position in HZDS and Parliament. 
 He also represents a less-arrogant alternative to Meciar for 
those inclined toward nationalist parties and HZDS. 
Gasparovic aims to be a clean slate, a \"man without 
characteristics\" attracting various disaffected voters. 
Apart from a message espousing social rights and patriotism, 
he doesn\'t have a message.  His web page is 
www.gasparovic.sk; it\'s more or less empty, with some photos 
that present him as a \"nice person.\" 
 
Not a Saint 
----------- 
 
6. (C) There is more to Gasparovic.  As one of Meciar\'s 
staunchest supporters for a decade, he is sometimes referred 
to as \"Meciar Lite.\"  His break with HZDS was over 
personality conflicts with Meciar, not policy or principles. 
Throughout his tenure as chairman of Parliament, Gasparovic 
made sure Meciar\'s initiatives passed by any means necessary 
-- relegating opposition politicians to the environment and 
human rights committees.  He presided over dividing the 
spoils (government offices and properties) among HZDS and its 
allies.  It is unclear what Gasparovic gained from the 
privatization process.  Gasparovic staunchly defended Meciar 
during the drama when President Michal Kovac\'s son was 
kidnapped. 
 
Comment: A Small Boost 
---------------------- 
 
7. (C) Comment. Embassy contacts suggest the Smer endorsement 
might add a maximum of two to three percent to Gasparovic\'s 
election results.  With consistent ratings in the mid-teens 
compared to Kukan\'s and Meciar\'s low-to-mid-20-percent 
results, this would not be enough to get Gasparovic to the 
second round.  The best Gasparovic can hope for is to 
strengthen his HZD party, possibly at the cost of Meciar\'s 
HZDS, especially if Meciar loses the presidential election. 
 
Should Meciar win the Presidency (a doubtful outcome), 
Gasparovic told us he hopes to re-enter and reform HZDS, 
taking leadership away from Meciar.  He believes Meciar would 
be too preoccupied with the presidency and protecting his 
family and wealth to control HZDS any longer.  End comment. 
 
Biographic Basics 
----------------- 
 
8. (U) Gasparovic was born in Poltar, Slovakia, on March 27, 
1941.  He is married with two children.  Gasparovic has a law 
degree from Comenius University in Bratislava and worked as a 
Bratislava prosecutor before teaching at Comenius.  He was 
briefly chief prosecutor of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic 
in 1990 before President Havel recalled him for inactivity on 
former Communists\' crimes.  In 1992, Gasparovic became a 
member of Parliament for HZDS, and was chairman of Parliament 
from then until 1998, though he remained an MP until 2002.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  ON MARCH 23, THREE UNIDENTIFIED ASSAILANTS 
    ATTACKED AND SERIOUSLY INJURED JAN LANGOS, THE HEAD OF THE 
INSTITUTE OF THE MEMORY OF THE NATION (IMN), WHILE HE WAS WALKING 
HOME AT MIDNIGHT.  THE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING THE CRIME AS A 
ROBBERY.  NONETHELESS, THE INCIDENT CLOSELY RESEMBLES AN ATTACK 
ON LANGOS\' WIFE LAST YEAR AND COULD BE INTERPRETED AS ANOTHER 
\"WARNING\" FROM THOSE WHO MAY FEEL THREATENED BY THE IMN\'S 
ACTIVITIES, WHICH FOCUS ON OPENING THE FORMER COMMUNIST 
INTELLIGENCE (STB) FILES AND DISCLOSING DETAILS ABOUT STB 
EMPLOYEES AND CONTACTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
WHAT HAPPENED 
------------- 
2. (U) ON THE NIGHT OF MARCH 23, JAN LANGOS, THE HEAD OF THE IMN 
AND FORMER CZECHOSLOVAK INTERIOR MINISTER, WAS ATTACKED BY THREE 
APPARENTLY WELL-TRAINED, MUSCULAR MEN.  THE GROUP KNOCKED LANGOS 
DOWN AND BEAT HIM SERIOUSLY.  THEY ALSO BROKE HIS ARM AND FINGERS 
WHILE PULLING OFF HIS WEDDING RING.  HIS WALLET AND MONEY WERE 
LEFT UNTOUCHED.  LANGOS LOST CONSCIOUSNESS DURING THE ATTACK AND 
WAS UNABLE TO DESCRIBE HIS ASSAILANTS TO THE POLICE. 
 
ROLE OF IMN 
----------- 
3. (U) THE INSTITUTE OF THE MEMORY OF THE NATION WAS ESTABLISHED 
BY LAW IN 2003.  THE IMN\'S ROLE IS TO COLLECT, MAINTAIN AND OPEN 
THE INTELLIGENCE ARCHIVES FROM THE NAZI AND COMMUNIST ERA (1939- 
89), TO PROSECUTE NAZI AND COMMUNIST CRIMES, AS WELL AS CRIMES 
AGAINST PEACE, HUMAN DIGNITY AND WAR CRIMES, INCLUDING ALL FORMS 
OF POLITICALLY-BASED REPRESSION.  SDKU PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND 
FOREIGN MINISTER EDUARD KUKAN, WHOSE FORMER SCHOOLMATE 
ANONYMOUSLY ACCUSED HIM IN THE PRESS OF HAVING TIES TO THE STB, 
IS AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE REQUESTED DISCLOSURE OF THEIR FILES. 
    PARLIAMENT ELECTED LANGOS CHAIRMAN OF THE INSTITUTE BOARD IN 
APRIL 2003. 
 
4. (SBU) THE DAY BEFORE THE VOTE, LANGOS\' WIFE GABRIELA WAS 
BEATEN AND SERIOUSLY INJURED IN PRAGUE, WHERE SHE RESIDES.  THE 
PERPETRATORS LEFT HER PURSE UNTOUCHED.  ANOTHER INCIDENT OCCURRED 
IN THE FALL OF 2003 WHEN A CAR FROM THE PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICE 
SECURITON HIT GABRIELA\'S CAR AT HIGH SPEED, IN A WAY THAT 
RESEMBLED THE WELL-KNOWN ACCIDENTS STAGED BY COMMUNIST 
INTELLIGENCE IN THE PAST.  THE POLICE NEVER COMPLETED THE 
INVESTIGATION OF THIS CAR ACCIDENT. 
 
LANGOS - FORMER DISSIDENT AND COMMUNIST-HUNTER 
--------------------------------------------- - 
5. (SBU) LANGOS IS A WELL-KNOWN FORMER DISSIDENT, ANTI-COMMUNIST, 
AND LONGTIME EMBASSY CONTACT.  HE INITIATED SLOVAKIA\'S FREEDOM OF 
INFORMATION ACT AND OTHER TRANSPARENCY ACTS.  HE ALSO 
ORCHESTRATED THE OPENING OF THE COMMUNIST AND NAZI INTELLIGENCE 
FILES.  AS THE CZECHOSLOVAK MINISTER OF INTERIOR IN 1990, LANGOS 
DISSOLVED THE COMMUNIST INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (STB) AND ENDORSED 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A LUSTRATION LAW THAT WOULD HAVE BANNED 
COMMUNIST PARTY FUNCTIONARIES AND STB OFFICERS FROM SERVING IN 
PUBLIC OFFICES.  MECIAR\'S GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, FAILED TO ENACT 
THIS LAW.  LANGOS IS COMMITTED TO EXPOSING THE CRIMES COMMITTED 
UNDER COMMUNIST RULE. 
 
NO REACTION FROM INTERIOR MINISTRY 
---------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) TO DATE, THE INTERIOR MINISTRY HAS MADE NO PUBLIC 
STATEMENT ABOUT THE BEATING, AND AN OFFICIAL TOLD POL FSN ON 
MARCH 26 THAT THE INCIDENT IS BEING TREATED AS A STREET CRIME 
    UNTIL THE POLICE INVESTIGATION PROVES OTHERWISE.  WHEN ASKED 
ABOUT INTERIOR MINISTER VLADIMIR PALKO\'S REACTION, HIS ADVISOR 
JAROSLAV DANISKA TOLD THE EMBASSY THAT HE WOULD ENCOURAGE PALKO 
TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT CONDEMNING VIOLENCE TOWARD LANGOS. 
THE AMBASSADOR SENT A LETTER TO LANGOS CONDEMNING THE ACT OF 
VIOLENCE AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT.  LANGOS TOLD EMBOFFS THAT HE 
HIGHLY VALUES THE USG SUPPORT AND WILL CONTINUE HIS WORK IN SPITE 
OF THE ATTACK. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. (SBU) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH THE ABOVE INCIDENTS MIGHT BE CONSTRUED 
AS RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE, THEY BEAR THE UNMISTAKABLE HALLMARK 
OF THE FORMER COMMUNIST INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, WHICH USED TO WARN 
ITS ADVERSARIES WITH STAGED CAR INCIDENTS AND VIOLENT STREET 
CRIMES.  THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THESE THREE INCIDENTS MIGHT BE 
UNRELATED, BUT THEY MAY BE ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE THE INSTITUTE 
AND LANGOS AS WELL AS TO DEMORALIZE THE STAFF.  NOW THAT THE LAW 
ALLOWS OPENING THE COMMUNIST FILES, A NUMBER OF FORMER OFFICIALS 
MAY FEEL THEIR REPUTATIONS ARE IN JEOPARDY.  THESE EVENTS COULD 
HAVE BEEN ORCHESTRATED BY INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS WHO FEEL 
THREATENED BY THE IMN OR COULD BE ACTS OF PERSONAL REVENGE.

PROSECUTION ON ARMS DEAL CONTINUES, SLOWLY 
------------------------------------------ 
    1. (SBU) THERE HAS BEEN SLIGHT PROGRESS IN THE CASE OF 
FORMER SLOVAK NATIONALIST PARTY DEPUTY VITAZOSLAV MORIC AND 
A COLLEAGUE, WHO ATTEMPTED TO SELL A SOPHISTICATED RADAR 
SYSTEM TO NORTH KOREA IN 1998.  INTERIOR MINISTRY SPOKESMAN 
BORIS AZALTOVIC TOLD MEDIA THE INVESTIGATION IS FINISHED AND 
THE MINISTRY HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROSECUTOR BRING 
CHARGES AGAINST THE TWO.  COMMENT: WE CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR 
A PROSECUTION ON THIS CASE, WHICH HAS MOVED SLOWLY THROUGH 
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.  PROSECUTION OF ARMS DEALS REMAINS THE 
BIGGEST STUMBLING BLOCK IN SLOVAKIA\'S EXPORT CONTROL REGIME. 
 
EXPERTS PREDICT LOW TURNOUT FOR REFERENDUM 
------------------------------------------ 
2. (SBU) RECENT OPINION POLLS SUGGEST THAT TURNOUT COULD BE 
AS HIGH AS OVER HALF TO TWO-THIRDS OF THE ELECTORATE FOR THE 
TRADE UNION AND SMER-SUPPORTED REFERENDUM TO CALL FOR NEW 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  ANALYSTS CLOSE TO THE EMBASSY 
SUGGEST BASED ON PAST ELECTIONS THAT PEOPLE FREQUENTLY SAY 
THEY WILL VOTE, THEN DON\'T.  VIRTUALLY ALL EXPERTS PREDICT 
THE REFERENDUM WILL NOT ATTRACT THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS 
REQUIRED FOR IT TO BE VALID. 
 
ANTI-CORRUPTION SUCCESS STORIES 
------------------------------- 
3. (U) THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION SCORED SOME MAJOR 
SUCCESSES THIS MONTH.  HZDS MPS MILAN REHAK AND IGOR PINKAVA 
WERE CHARGED WITH FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRIVATIZATION 
PROCESS BY DIVERTING OVER SKK 41 MILLION ($1.26 MILLION) 
FROM THE NATIONAL PROPERTY FUND.  BUT THE MINISTRY OF 
INTERIOR HAS NOT ONLY GONE AFTER OPPOSITION OFFICIALS.  THE 
DEPUTY MAYOR OF KOSICE, SDKU NOMINEE EUGEN CUNO, AND A LOCAL 
    LAWYER WERE CAUGHT RED-HANDED ACCEPTING A SKK 1 MILLION 
($30,581) BRIBE TO CHOOSE A CERTAIN CONTRACTOR TO BUILD 
MUNICIPAL HOUSING.  BOTH WERE CHARGED WITH CORRUPTION. 
MEANWHILE, PETER PUSKAR, WHO RAN ON A COALITION TICKET FOR 
LOCAL ELECTIONS IN BRATISLAVA, WAS ACCUSED OF BEING THE HEAD 
OF A GANG THAT FUNNELED SKK 230 MILLION (OVER $7 MILLION) 
FROM THE STATE TREASURY THROUGH FICTITIOUS BUSINESS SALES. 
 
INTERIOR MINISTRY ON ROMA, EXTREMISM, AND ALCOHOL ABUSE 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
4. (SBU) PAVOL DRAXLER, ADVISOR ON EXTREMISM TO INTERIOR 
MINISTER VLADIMIR PALKO, TOLD POLOFFS THAT FOLLOWING ROMA 
UNREST IN THE EAST, HE WENT ON A MONITORING TRIP TO TREBISOV 
WITH OFFICIALS FROM EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS AND NGOS.  IN HIS 
OPINION, THE POLICE ACTED FAIRLY WHEN THEY BROKE UP THE 
UNLAWFUL DEMONSTRATION IN THE SQUARE.  THERE WERE COMPLAINTS 
ABOUT POLICE SURROUNDING THE ROMA SETTLEMENT AND ROUSING 
RESIDENTS OUT OF BED WITH GUNS, BUT DRAXLER SAID THIS WAS 
NECESSARY TO PROTECT PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CITIZENS.  THE 
POLICE WILL BE REMOVED AFTER THE NEXT WELFARE PAYMENTS ONCE 
IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL VIOLENCE.  HE 
SAID MUCH OF THE PROBLEM CAN BE BLAMED ON USURERS, WHO HAVE 
A BROAD NETWORK IN THE MAJOR TOWNS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 
CERTAIN STORES WITH CONNECTIONS TO THE USURERS WERE 
UNTOUCHED BY THE EVENTS.  THE CASE OF A ROMA MAN FOUND DEAD 
AFTER BEING REPORTED MISSING FOR TWO WEEKS WAS SHOWN TO BE 
A DROWNING, DRAXLER SAID.  HE STATED THAT THE MAN WAS NEVER 
UNDER POLICE CUSTODY AND RAN AWAY FROM THE SETTLEMENT WHEN 
THE POLICE ARRIVED.  THE MAN WAS A KNOWN DRUG USER AND WAS 
ON PROBATION.  HE PROBABLY TRIPPED AND FELL IN THE RIVER AND 
POSSIBLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE WAS UNABLE TO GET OUT.  PEOPLE 
    AGAINST RACISM WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO VIEW THE CORONER\'S 
REPORT. 
 
5. (SBU) POLOFF ASKED ABOUT THE ZAHORSKA VES CASE, WHERE 
ROMA ACTIVISTS ACCUSED THE MAYOR OF PURCHASING LAND WHERE 
ROMA LIVE AND FORCING THEM OUT OF TOWN.  DRAXLER SAID THE 
CASE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. 
 
6. (SBU) THE CONVERSATION THEN TURNED TO EXTREMISM, WHICH IS 
DEFINED BY THE MOI AS HATE CRIMES, SKINHEAD ACTIVITY, ET AL. 
AS PART OF THE MOI RESTRUCTURING, THERE IS A RESPONSIBLE 
OFFICER IN EACH DISTRICT TO MONITOR EXTREMISM.  COOPERATION 
WITH NGOS CONTINUES, ESPECIALLY WITH PEOPLE AGAINST RACISM 
AND SARLOTA PUFFLEROVA\'S CITIZENS AND DEMOCRACY. 
 
7. (SBU) DRAXLER SAID AFTER SEVERAL POLICEMEN WERE FIRED DUE 
TO ALCOHOL PROBLEMS, THERE IS A NEW CULTURE OF NOT ABUSING 
ALCOHOL FORMING IN THE POLICE RANKS.  POLICE DO NOT EVEN 
DRINK THE DAY BEFORE WORK FROM FEAR OF BREATHALYZERS.

REF: BRATISLAVA 245 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  BESIDES THE ECONOMIC REFORMS THAT 
SLOVAKIA HAS INSTITUTED, THERE ARE MANY OTHER REFORMS STILL 
    TAKING PLACE.  WE OFFER THESE VIEWS FROM GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS, WHO COMMENT ON DECENTRALIZATION AND JUSTICE 
REFORM, AS WELL AS DETAILS OF A NEW ELECTION LAW THAT WAS 
PASSED BY PARLIAMENT BUT RECENTLY VETOED BY PRESIDENT 
SCHUSTER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DECENTRALIZATION: MAYORS LIKE MONEY, NOT RESPONSIBILITY 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
2. (SBU) SLOVAKIA\'S STRUGGLE TO OVERCOME ITS COMMUNIST PAST 
IS PLAYING OUT IN THE ONGOING EFFORT TO DECENTRALIZE 
SERVICES SUCH AS EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, AND LOCAL PUBLIC 
WORKS.  VIKTOR NIZNANSKY, THE PLENIPOTENTIARY FOR PUBLIC 
ADMINISTRATION REFORM, TOLD POLOFFS THAT THE FISCAL PART OF 
DECENTRALIZATION LAWS COULD BE READY TO INCORPORATE INTO THE 
STATE BUDGET BY 2005.  MUNICIPALITIES AND REGIONS WOULD GET 
MOST OF THEIR FUNDS FROM A FIXED SHARE OF THE INCOME TAX. 
THE LOCALITIES CAN DECIDE ON HOW AND HOW MUCH TO COLLECT IN 
VARIOUS OTHER FEES AND TAXES.  NIZNANSKY SAID LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS WELCOME MORE POWER AND MONEY, BUT NOT THE 
ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.  THE FACT THAT 
MORE MONEY WILL NOT COME AUTOMATICALLY FROM 
DECENTRALIZATION, BUT WILL DEPEND ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
ACTIVITIES, IS NOT SO ATTRACTIVE TO LOCAL OFFICIALS. 
 
3. (SBU) NIZNANSKY BELIEVES THE EXISTING 2,900 COMMUNITIES 
IN SLOVAKIA EVENTUALLY SHOULD BE MERGED INTO 200 TO 300 
MUNICIPALITIES.  MANY SMALL COMMUNITIES CANNOT PROVIDE BASIC 
SERVICES FOR CITIZENS, AS MUCH OF THEIR INCOME GOES TO 
SALARIES FOR MAYORS AND CITY COUNCILS.  CONSOLIDATION WOULD 
ALLOW THE LARGER COMMUNITIES TO TAKE OVER FUNCTIONS LIKE 
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, SOCIAL WELFARE, AND SCHOOLS FROM THE 
    CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  AT THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL, 
NIZNANSKY SAID STAFFING IS STILL BLOATED WITH EMPLOYEES 
WHOSE FUNCTIONS ARE UNKNOWN OR LONG FORGOTTEN, YET THE 
MINISTRIES SOMETIMES CANNOT DO NECESSARY WORK, SUCH AS 
CALCULATIONS FOR SCHOOL REFORM. 
 
PRESIDENT VETOES NEW ELECTION LAW 
--------------------------------- 
4. (U) PARLIAMENT PASSED, BUT THE PRESIDENT VETOED, A NEW 
BILL ON PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  PRESIDENT SCHUSTER SAID HE 
FELT THE ELECTION DEPOSIT REQUIREMENT RAN AFOUL OF THE 
CONSTITUTION PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN 
ELECTIONS.  THE LAW ADDRESSES MOST CONCERNS RAISED BY 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND DOMESTIC NGOS, WITH TWO MAIN 
EXCEPTIONS.  THE SINGLE ELECTION DISTRICT REMAINS; AND MPS 
WILL STILL BE ELECTED VIA PARTY LISTS NOT LINKED TO ANY 
LOCALITY.  THE LAW 
-- CREATES AN EASIER ABSENTEE VOTE SYSTEM FOR SLOVAKS 
ABROAD; 
-- DISCOURAGES FRIVOLOUS PARTIES BY REQUIRING A DEPOSIT THAT 
WILL BE REFUNDED ONLY IF THEY GET 3 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE 
VOTE; 
-- STRENGTHENS THE WEIGHT OF PREFERENTIAL VOTES; 
-- SETS ELECTIONS ON AN ENTIRE SATURDAY RATHER THAN ON TWO 
DAYS AS BEFORE; 
-- ALLOWS THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN TO BEGIN 21 DAYS PRIOR TO 
THE VOTE AND TO BE RUN IN THE MEDIA; AND 
--LIFTS THE MORATORIUM ON CAMPAIGNING DURING THE LAST 48 
HOURS BEFORE THE ELECTION. 
 
MP CRITICIZES JUSTICE REFORM PROPOSALS 
    -------------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) JAN DRGONEC, CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND 
LEGAL COMMITTEE AND MP FOR ANO, MET WITH POLOFFS TO FOLLOW 
UP ON PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT (REFTEL).  THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
AMENDMENT SETTING UP \"INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEES\" HAS STALLED, 
BUT DRGONEC AND COLLEAGUES CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THE EVENTUAL 
FORM OVERSIGHT WILL TAKE.  DRGONEC COMMENTED THAT JUSTICE 
MINISTER DANIEL LIPSIC\'S JUDICIAL REFORMS FOCUS ON GIVING 
MORE POWER TO HIS MINISTRY.  HE MENTIONED THAT SUPREME COURT 
PRESIDENT MILAN KARABIN SEEMS TO BE TOO WEAK AND SERVILE VIS- 
A-VIS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.  DRGONEC SUGGESTED THE SPECIAL 
COURT TO INVESTIGATE CORRUPTION AMONG PUBLIC OFFICIALS COULD 
BECOME A POLITICAL TOOL.  HE BELIEVES REAL JUDICIAL REFORM 
REQUIRES REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES 
(THERE ARE 78 POSITIONS AND 17 JUDGES HAVE ALREADY LEFT, 
WITH MORE AT RETIREMENT AGE), AND DEVOLVING SOME 
RESPONSIBILITIES TO REGIONAL AND DISTRICT COURTS.  DRGONEC 
WAS GLAD THAT LIPSIC WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ELIMINATING THE 
TRENCIN AND TRNAVA REGIONAL COURTS, BECAUSE THERE ARE 
SEVERAL MAFIA CASES ONGOING.  CLOSING THE COURTS WOULD HAVE 
MEANT RE-STARTING THE CASES AND RELEASING THE SUSPECTS.  IN 
DRGONEC\'S OPINION, THIS WAS TOO HIGH A PRICE TO PAY FOR 
\"JUDICIAL REFORM.\"

SUBJECT: SIMKO LOSES LEADERSHIP OF FREE FORUM 
 
1. (SBU) ON MARCH 26, THE FOUNDING CONGRESS OF FREE FORUM 
(FF, A BREAK-AWAY PARTY FROM PM DZURINDA\'S SDKU) TURNED INTO 
DRAMA WHEN IVAN SIMKO FAILED TO WIN THE CHAIRMANSHIP IN HIS 
NEW PARTY.  INSTEAD, ZUZANA MARTINAKOVA WON BY A SINGLE VOTE 
(131 VS. SIMKO\'S 130).  THE VISIBLY SHAKEN SIMKO RELUCTANTLY 
    ACCEPTED THE FIRST DEPUTY CHAIRMAN POSITION.  FOUR OTHER 
DEPUTY CHAIRS (JOZEF HURBAN, PETER BODY, BRANISLAV OPATERNY, 
AND EVA HLAVACOVA) WERE ALSO ELECTED.  ACCORDING TO SOME 
ANALYSTS, THE VOTE REFLECTED A DIVISION IN OPINION IN THE 
NEWLY ESTABLISHED PARTY:  MARTINAKOVA REPRESENTS MORE 
RADICAL OPPOSITION TO THE GOS AND SIMKO REPORTEDLY ADVOCATES 
A MORE MODERATE STAND. 
 
ALWAYS IN SECOND PLACE 
---------------------- 
2. (SBU) SIMKO\'S FAILURE TO BE ELECTED CHAIRMAN CAME AS A 
SURPRISE.  SIMKO WAS NOT ABLE TO HIDE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT. 
HIS IMMEDIATE REACTION TO JOURNALISTS WAS, \"IF I WERE A REAL 
MAN, I WOULD LEAVE.\"  HOWEVER, HIS SUPPORTERS CONVINCED HIM 
TO ACCEPT THE FIRST DEPUTY CHAIR.  SOME POLITICAL ANALYSTS 
POINTED OUT SIMKO\'S TRACK RECORD: HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A 
SUCCESSFUL PARTY ORGANIZER, BUT SOMEONE ELSE SERVES AS THE 
PUBLIC FACE.  SIMKO HELPED TO ESTABLISH THE CHRISTIAN 
DEMOCRAT PARTY (KDH), LATER SDK, AND THEN WITH DZURINDA THE 
SDKU, BUT HE REMAINED NUMBER TWO IN ALL OF THEM.  IT 
HAPPENED AGAIN WITH FREE FORUM. 
 
3. (SBU) HEAD OF THE IVO THINK TANK GRIGORIJ MESEZNIKOV TOLD 
POLFSN THAT THIS IS THE FIRST CASE IN SLOVAK PARTY HISTORY 
WHEN A FOUNDER FAILED TO WIN CHAIRMANSHIP.  HE STATED THAT 
MARTINAKOVA IS A MORE ACCEPTABLE CANDIDATE FOR THE PUBLIC 
AND MAY GAIN MORE SUPPORT THAN THE OFTEN INDECISIVE AND 
INCOMPREHENSIBLE SIMKO. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT: THE DCM WAS TOLD BY A SENIOR ANO 
POLITICIAN THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM MARTINAKOVA\'S HUSBAND 
    MARIAN BEDNAR (FORMER MOD ADVISOR TO SIMKO AND ALLEGED 
MEMBER OF THE \"SKUPINKA\") HAS KEPT THE FF VIABLE.  THIS 
INFORMATION HAS NOT APPEARED PUBLICLY, BUT IF TRUE COULD 
HAVE HELPED HER CANDIDACY.  END COMMENT. 
 
MORE RADICAL OPPOSITION 
----------------------- 
5. (SBU) THE ATTEMPT TO RECALL FINANCE MINISTER IVAN MIKLOS 
EARLIER THIS MONTH PUBLICLY REVEALED THE DIVIDE IN THE FF. 
WHILE SIMKO REFUSED TO SIDE WITH THE OPPOSITION, MARTINAKOVA 
ADVOCATED MIKLOS\'S RECALL AS WELL-DESERVED.  IN THE END, FF 
MP\'S ABSTAINED FROM THE VOTE.  PREVIOUSLY, THERE WERE HINTS 
OF DISAGREEMENT WHEN SIMKO CONDITIONED ENTERING THE 
GOVERNING COALITION ON DZURINDA\'S RESIGNATION.  SMK 
INTERLOCUTORS SPECULATED AT THE TIME THAT SIMKO WAS 
FOLLOWING ADVICE FROM OTHERS IN HIS NEW PARTY, BECAUSE HE 
HAD NOT BEEN SO RADICAL IN PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS. 
 
6. (SBU) REFLECTING THE IDEOLOGICAL SPLIT, AND THE CLAIM 
THAT FF IS MORE DEMOCRATIC THAN THE SDKU, PARTY MEMBERS 
INSISTED THAT BOTH SIMKO AND MARTINAKOVA RUN FOR 
CHAIRMANSHIP.  VIRTUALLY NO ONE EXPECTED THAT MARTINAKOVA 
WOULD WIN SINCE SHE WAS SIMKO\'S PROTEGE.  HE BROUGHT HER 
INTO POLITICS AS THE \"FEMALE FACE\" OF SDKU.  SHE HAS MOVED 
FAR FROM THAT ROLE.  SHORTLY AFTER HER ELECTION, MARTINAKOVA 
SAID THAT DZURINDA\'S GOVERNMENT CAN NO LONGER RELY ON FF 
SUPPORT.  SHOULD THERE BE ANOTHER RECALL VOTE ON MIKLOS, THE 
FF WOULD BACK IT, SHE ADDED. 
 
BIO NOTES ON MARTINAKOVA 
------------------------ 
    7. (SBU) MARTINAKOVA WAS BORN MAY 5, 1961 IN PUCHOV.  SHE 
STUDIED FRENCH AND SLOVAK LANGUAGES AT COMMENIUS UNIVERSITY 
FACULTY OF PHILOSPHY IN BRATISLAVA.  BEFORE ENTERING 
POLITICS, SHE WAS A JOURNALIST WITH SLOVAK RADIO, RADIO FREE 
EUROPE, AND THE BBC.  SHE HAS BEEN CHAIRWOMAN OF THE 
\"DEMOCRACY FOUNDATION\" SINCE 2000, AND A MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT SINCE 2002.  HER CV STATES SHE IS FLUENT IN 
ENGLISH AND FRENCH, ALTHOUGH REPORTEDLY SHE FEELS 
UNCOMFORTABLE IN ENGLISH FROM LACK OF USE.  SHE IS MARRIED 
TO MARIAN BEDNAR AND THEY HAVE THREE CHILDREN. 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (SBU) IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT EFFECT MARTINAKOVA\'S

ABILITY TO GOVERN.  FF WILL NOT ROCK THE BOAT BEFORE MAY 1 
EU ACCESSION.  IN THE PAST, MARTINAKOVA HAS MADE STRONG

ENOUGH OF A PLAYER TO REMAIN ON THE POLITICAL SCENE BEYOND 
THE NEXT ELECTIONS WILL BE HER BIGGEST CHALLENGE.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF GEN ROBERT H. FOGLESONG, 
COMMANDER U.S. AIR FORCES IN EUROPE AND ALLIED AIR FORCES 
NORTH 
 
 
1. (U) Summary and Introduction: Welcome to Slovakia!  I 
regret that I will not be able to join you in Sliac.  I 
expect that you will have a productive visit on April 5 and 
learn first-hand how Slovakia will contribute to the 
Alliamce.  I hope you will have the opportunity to return to 
Slovakia soon and visit Kuchyna, the Slovak range near 
Bratislava where the 16th Air Force has trained on several 
occasions.  I look forward to welcoming you then. 
 
2. (SBU) Your visit provides the opportunity to: 
 
--welcome the Slovak Air Force as a new member of the 
Alliance, expressing confidence that cooperation between 
Slovakia and fellow NATO members will continue to deepen and 
encouraging them to consider tactical airlift (C-130) for the 
future; 
 
--thank the GOS for their contribution to Operation Enduring 
Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom as well as their intended 
deployment to ISAF in May, encouraging them to continue to 
contribute to the war on terrorism depite the recent barbaric 
attacks on military forces and civilian populations of 
coalition members; 
 
--encourage the GOS to stay the course on military reform and 
professionalization. 
 
There will be a press conference during which Slovak 
journalists will likely ask questions about Slovakia\'s NATO 
membership, specifically how Slovakia\'s Air Forces will be 
integrated into NATO and what the Slovak Air Force\'s 
contribution brings to the Alliance.  In addition, reporters 
may inquire about Slovakia\'s participation in both OEF and 
OIF. 
 
Political Dynamics 
------------------ 
 
3.  (SBU) Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda\'s government is a 
center-right coalition made up of four parties that were 
elected in the fall of 2002 to a four-year term.  Although 
this government is more ideologically coherent than its 
predecessor, also led by Dzurinda, it has faced considerable 
challenges since its formation.  Dzurinda recalled Minister 
of Defense Ivan Simko in September 2003 for what he described 
as insubordation.  Simko would not support the PM\'s decision 
to recall the head of the National Security Office (NBU), 
which issues NATO security clearances.  Juraj Liska, a member 
of Dzurinda\'s party and former mayor of Trencin, was named 
Defense Minister in October. 
 
4.  (SBU) On April 3 Slovakia will hold the first round of 
presidential elections.  The president has little formal 
power in Slovakia, but can influence decisions by using his 
office as a bully pulpit and can veto legislation.  There are 
currently 11 candidates in the race, but only 
three--including Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan, former PM 
Vladimir Meciar, and former speaker of parliament Ivan 
Gasparovic--have any real chance of making it into a second 
round.  A second round between the top two vote getters will 
be held on April 17 if no candidate wins at least 50 percent 
of the vote. 
 
5.  (SBU) Opposition parties and labor unions have organized 
a referendum for April 3 calling for early elections which 
will be held concurrently with the presidential elections. 
Slovakia has had only one successful referendum since 
independence with the others failing due to a lack of voter 
turnout.  All public opinion polls to date suggest that this 
one will fail as well due insufficient turnout.  The 
referendum is non-binding, so the decision to hold early 
elections would still have to be made in parliament, where it 
would likely fail. 
 
Defense Spending 
---------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) The Slovaks committed to spending 2 percent of GDP 
after the Prague Summit.  For 2004, the defense budget is 
1.81 percent of GDP, but additional outlays, including 
settlement of Soviet-era debt, should bring total defense 
spending to 2.02 percent.  However, Finance Minister Miklos 
 
has argued strongly that defense spending be cut and it is 
unclear whether the GOS and parliament have the willpower to 
keep defense spending at a real 2 percent in the out years. 
 
OIF/OEF/ISAF 
------------ 
 
7.  (SBU) Per capita, Slovakia is one of the most active 
international peace-keeping nations with approximately 750 
personnel deployed in 11 missions.  The GOS, with only 
minimal public backing, strongly supported the war in Iraq 
and sent a chem-bio consequence management unit to Kuwait 
under Czech command.  After the end of hostilities, the unit 
(82-strong) was replaced with an engineering unit (105 
soldiers) that is currently deployed in the Polish sector. 
 
8.  (SBU) The Slovaks also have a 40-person air-field 
construction unit deployed as part of OEF at Bagram Air Base 
in Afghanistan.  Their six-month mandate has been extended 
three times.  PM Dzurinda visited this unit in January.  The 
Slovaks will send a 15-person demining team to Afghanistan 
under ISAF command in May, their first mission as a NATO 
member under the NATO flag. 
 
Military Reform 
--------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) This year the Ministry of Defense will conduct a 
mid-course review of its long-term military reform strategy 
Force 2010.  The review will take into account changes in 
NATO Force Goals as well as different realities in Slovakia. 
The Slovaks are committed to developing their chemical 
defense unit as a niche capability for NATO.  The other niche 
capabilities they have identified are military police and 
engineers. 
 
10.  (SBU) Defense Minister Liska commissioned a new study on 
the air force which recommended extending the life of 10 
MiG-29s plus 2 trainers, rather than follow the paths of 
their neighbors and issue a tender for fighters.  The study 
also suggested upgrading 18 Mi-24 attack helicopters, but the 
Slovaks plan to upgrade 10.  In addition, the study 
recommended acquiring 2-4 medium lift transport aircraft by 
2010.  They are considering acquiring C-130s under the Excess 
Defense Articles program.  This proposal is still in the 
early stages, but the Slovaks are very interested.  We have 
encouraged Liska to incorporate the study within the larger 
context of Force 2010. 
 
11. (SBU) Major General Jozef Dunaj, Commander of the Slovak 
Air Force, is not a fan of the F-16.  He supports MiG-29 
upgrades as a stopgap measure, but would prefer to see 
Slovakia acquire F-18s or Joint Strike Fighters in the 
future.  MajGen Dunaj is likely to inquire about USAFE\'s 
support for the Bratislava air show (SIAD) on June 12-13, 
2004.  USDAO has already forwarded requests for participation 
by USAFE, based on requests from the Slovak Air Force, namely 
flying displays of F-15 and F-117 aircraft and static 
displays of KC-135 and A-10A aircraft.  Dunaj will also seek 
a committment for increased contact and training 
opportunities for 16th Air Force, using the training range at 
Kuchyna/Malacky airbase.

ROUND WHILE REFERENDUM FAILS 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. RONALD WEISER FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D 
 
    1.  (C) SUMMARY.  THE RESULTS OF THE APRIL 3 FIRST ROUND OF 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SHOCKED MOST OF SLOVAKIA.  HIGH POLL 
NUMBERS, COMPLACENCY, AND PROTEST VOTES AGAINST RECENT 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS HURT FOREIGN MINISTER EDUARD 
KUKAN AS ALMOST EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WOULD MAKE IT INTO THE 
SECOND ROUND.  LOW VOTER TURNOUT, HOWEVER, WORKED IN FAVOR OF 
VLADIMIR MECIAR (HIS VOTERS CONSISTENTLY SHOW UP AT THE 
POLLS) AND SMER-BACKED IVAN GASPAROVIC.  THE SECOND ROUND 
WILL BE HELD ON APRIL 17 -- HIGHER VOTER TURNOUT WILL LIKELY 
FAVOR GASPAROVIC WHILE MECIAR WOULD PROBABLY WIN IF VOTERS 
STAY AWAY.  THE REFERENDUM SEEKING EARLY ELECTIONS FAILED DUE 
TO INSUFFICIENT VOTER TURNOUT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE RESULTS 
----------- 
 
2.  (U) OUT OF 4,202,899 ELIGIBLE VOTERS ONLY 1,986,214 
TURNED OUT TO VOTE (47.9 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 74 PERCENT IN 
1999).  THE TOP SIX VOTE GETTERS ARE BROKEN OUT BELOW, AND 
THE REMAINING FIVE CANDIDATES EACH RECEIVED LESS THAN 1 
PERCENT. 
 
                           VOTES        PERCENTAGE 
VLADIMIR MECIAR            650,242      32.73 
IVAN GASPAROVIC            442,564      22.28 
EDUARD KUKAN               438,920      22.09 
RUDOLF SCHUSTER            147,549       7.42 
FRANTISEK MIKLOSKO         129,414       6.51 
MARTIN BUTORA              129,387       6.51 
 
LOW VOTER TURNOUT THE DETERMINING FACTOR 
    ---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) LOW VOTER TURNOUT WAS THE CRUSHING BLOW FOR EDUARD 
KUKAN\'S CANDIDACY.  ANALYSTS REPORT THAT RURAL VOTERS 
(OVERWHELMINGLY HZDS) CAME OUT; URBAN VOTERS STAYED HOME, 
CONFIDENT THAT THEIR VOTE WOULD ONLY BE NEEDED IN THE SECOND 
ROUND AGAINST MECIAR.  KUKAN SUPPORTERS UNDERESTIMATED THE 
IMPORTANCE OF CASTING VOTES BECAUSE ALL OF THE POLLS 
INDICATED THAT KUKAN WOULD MAKE IT INTO SECOND ROUND AND THAT 
THE ONLY QUESTION THAT REMAINED WAS WHO HE WOULD FACE. 
HUNGARIAN VOTERS STAYED HOME RATHER THAN SUPPORT THE KDH\'S 
FRANTISEK MIKLOSKO AS THEIR PARTY RECOMMENDED.  BUTORA\'S 6.51 
PERCENT WOULD LARGELY HAVE GONE TO KUKAN. 
 
REFERENDUM UNSUCCESSFUL 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (U) THE REFERENDUM ON EARLY ELECTIONS WAS UNSUCCESSFUL 
DUE TO INSUFFICIENT VOTER TURNOUT -- ONLY 35.86 PERCENT OF 
THOSE ELIGIBLE VOTED (12 PERCENT LESS THAN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
CONTEST), WHILE 50 PERCENT WAS REQUIRED FOR THE REFERENDUM TO 
BE VALID.  (TECHNICALLY, TWO ELECTIONS WERE HELD ON APRIL 3, 
IN SOME CASES WITH DIFFERENT POLLING PLACES, SO TURNOUT 
FIGURES DO NOT MATCH.)  OF THOSE WHO VOTED, 86.78 PERCENT 
FAVORED NEW ELECTIONS AND 11.93 WERE OPPOSED.  OPPOSITION 
LEADER ROBERT FICO TOLD THE PRESS THAT HE DID NOT CONSIDER 
THE FAILURE OF THE REFERENDUM (WHICH HIS SMER PARTY HAD 
CHAMPIONED) TO BE A FIASCO, BUT RATHER A SUCCESS BECAUSE MORE 
THAN ONE MILLION CITIZENS VOTED FOR A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT. 
FICO DID NOT RULE OUT FUTURE ATTEMPTS BY SMER TO UNSEAT 
DZURINDA\'S GOVERNMENT. 

COALITION VOTERS EXPRESS THEIR DISSATISFACTION 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5.  (C) PRESIDENT SCHUSTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THE ELECTION 
RESULTS REFLECT A PROTEST VOTE.  AFTER WEEKS OF BEING TOLD 
NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REFERENDUM, COALITION VOTERS 
FOLLOWED THOSE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER.  HOWEVER, THEY 
ALSO SHOWED THEIR DISPLEASURE WITH DZURINDA\'S SLOVAK 
DEMOCRATIC AND CHRISTIAN UNION (SDKU) BY NOT VOTING FOR 
KUKAN.  MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKS IN THE PRESS PLACE BLAME 
FOR THE COALITION\'S FAILURE ON SDKU FOR NOT CONSULTING WITH 
COALITION MEMBERS TO SELECT A CANDIDATE WHO COULD HAVE BEEN 
BACKED BY ALL FOUR PARTIES.  KUKAN\'S OWN STYLE DID NOT HELP 
HIS CAMPAIGN.  HE WAS LACKLUSTER WHILE STUMPING ON THE 
CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND UNINSPIRING DURING A TELEVISED DEBATE 
WHICH DID NOT MOTIVATE VOTERS TO GO TO THE POLLS ON A WARM 
AND SUNNY SATURDAY. 
 
MECIAR\'S STRATEGY FOR ROUND TWO 
------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) SERGEJ KOZLIK OF HZDS TOLD EMBOFF THAT HIS PARTY WAS 
SURPRISED AND EXCITED BY MECIAR\'S SUCCESS.  KOZLIK EXPECTED 
 
BRATISLAVA 00000338  002 OF 002 
 
UND.  KOZLIK WAS 
    CONFIDENT THAT HZDS VOTERS WOULD TURN OUT IN FORCE, BUT 
MECIAR HAS LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND HIS VOTER BASE AND 
THEREFORE LOW VOTER TURNOUT WORKS IN HIS FAVOR.  HE ADDED 
THAT THE TELEVISED DEBATES WOULD ALSO FAVOR MECIAR BECAUSE 
GASPAROVIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN SEEN AS MECIAR\'S NUMBER TWO. 
 
WHAT HAPPENS NOW 
---------------- 
 
7.  (C) THE SECOND ROUND OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WILL BE 
HELD ON APRIL 17, AND THE COALITION PARTIES FACE SOME 
DIFFICULT CHOICES OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.  IMMEDIATELY 
FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF ELECTION RESULTS, DZURINDA SAID 
THAT SDKU WOULD ENCOURAGE VOTERS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE POLLS 
ON APRIL 17; KDH HAS DONE THE SAME.  SMK AND ANO WILL DISCUSS 
STRATEGIES WITHIN THEIR OWN PARTIES BEFORE MAKING ANY 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS.  ANO MP CERNA TOLD 
EMBOFF THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO MOBILIZE THE VOTERS IN FAVOR 
OF THE LESSER EVIL, WHOM SHE VIEWS AS GASPAROVIC; HOWEVER, 
SHE ADDED THAT ANO WAS UNLIKELY TO OFFICIALLY ENDORSE EITHER 
CANDIDATE.  MARIAN LESKO, A POLITICAL ANALYST AND COLUMNIST, 
TOLD EMBOFF THAT AFTER THE INITIAL SHOCK AND DEPRESSION WORE 
OFF, HE EXPECTED COALITION LEADERS TO INDIRECTLY SUPPORT 
GASPAROVIC IN THE NEXT ROUND.  FICO AND SMER COULD PLAY THE 
ROLE OF KINGMAKER IF THEY ARE ABLE TO MOBILIZE THEIR VOTERS. 
AS ONE OF THE LARGEST PARTIES IN PARLIAMENT AND WITH 24-30 
PERCENT SUPPORT IN PUBLIC OPINION POLLING, SMER\'S SUPPORT 
COULD GREATLY ENHANCE GASPAROVIC\'S CHANCES OF WINNING.  HIGH 
VOTER TURNOUT WOULD INCREASE GASPAROVIC\'S CHANCES, BUT HE 
WOULD PROBABLY NEED SOME ANTI-MECIAR SUPPORT FROM THE 
COALITION\'S CONSTITUENCY.  (SEE SEPTEL FOR ANALYSIS OF A 
    MECIAR OR GASPAROVIC PRESIDENCY.)

SUBJECT: MECIAR OR GASPAROVIC: WHAT IT MEANS FOR US 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald Weiser for reason 1.4 b and d. 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  The April 17 run-off election for president 
does not present much of a choice: neither Meciar nor 
Gasparovic would be an ideal Slovak president in the view of 
the U.S. or Slovakia\'s new EU and NATO partners.  Although 
the president does not directly influence foreign policy, 
this election strengthens the position of nationalist and 
populist parties that are not particularly friendly to the 
U.S.  We should adopt a public line that stresses our respect 
for democratic choice, participation in the electoral 
process, and the attendant responsibility.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Vladimir Meciar against Ivan Gasparovic in the April 
17 second round of the presidential election was not what we 
(or anyone else) expected or hoped for.  Meciar has a history 
of abusing power, sanctioning corruption, and condoning 
illegal acts.  Gasparovic was for many years Meciar\'s 
lieutenant, and has supporters with both populist and 
nationalist tendencies.  Neither is especially friendly 
toward the U.S.  However, given the relative lack of power 
vested in the office of the president, we do not expect 
immediate effects on U.S. interests. 
 
Chance for Rehabilitation? 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Meciar seeks legitimacy and U.S. and EU approval.  He 
is now on the record as supporting Slovakia\'s membership in 
both NATO and the EU, and it is unlikely he would backtrack 
now.  His presidency would be a chance to rehabilitate his 
international image, and many analysts believe this would be 
his strongest motivation.  Foreign governments may be 
unwilling to invite him for official visits based on his 
behavior in the past, but even Slovaks who despise him 
believe he would not actively undermine Slovakia\'s 
reputation.  On the other hand, Meciar is unpredictable.  He 
will likely continue to play power games with his own party 
and with other politicians, and will control HZDS either 
directly or through a puppet (the tradition is for the 
president to resign from his party, although it is not a 
constitutional requirement). 
 
4. (C) Gasparovic is untested on the international scene, 
which means his name is not as tainted as Meciar\'s.  In the 
opinion of many, he is the lesser of two evils as a 
pragmatic, opportunist politician.  They believe that once he 
is in office, he will not worry about his small party (less 
than four percent support) and will leave the politicking to 
Smer.  Others, however, believe Gasparovic is more dangerous 
than Meciar, for both Slovakia\'s and U.S. interests. 
President Schuster pointed out to the Ambassador after the 
election that Gasparovic was Meciar\'s right-hand man who only 
broke with him over personal ambition (Meciar did not include 
him on the HZDS Parliament list for the last election), has 
never recanted or even acknowledged his actions under the 
Meciar regime, and, unlike Meciar, is allied with extremist 
nationalist elements.  PM Dzurinda\'s foreign policy advisor 
cautioned DCM that \"the worst candidate may not be the one 
you think.\"  Another Dzurinda advisor told P/E chief that 
Meciar would be \"easier to work with\" in completing the 
government\'s reform agenda.  (Comment: This may be a reaction 
to Fico\'s support of Gasparovic.) 
 
Damage on the Domestic Front 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Whether the next president is Meciar or Gasparovic, he 
will likely seek to undermine the governing coalition and its 
reform program.  He will veto legislation, influence 
appointments (such as ambassadorial and senior military 
posts), and use the bully pulpit to advance his interests and 
criticize the coalition.  To some extent, the governing 
coalition is accustomed to dealing with an \"opposition\" 
president, as Rudolf Schuster also vetoed many laws, held up 
ambassadorial appointments, and voiced his dissatisfaction 
with economic reforms.  More worrisome is how Meciar or 
Gasparovic might use the authority to grant presidential 
pardons and release corrupt cronies from jail, including 
former Slovak Information Service director Ivan Lexa and 
businessman Jozef Majsky (although under current law they 
must be convicted before they can be pardoned, unlike the 
pardons Meciar issued in the Kovac affair). 
 
Fallout 
------- 
 
6. (C) Opposition parties have new wind in their sails. 
There is already rampant (and overblown) speculation about 
what the next governing coalition might look like.  There is 
no doubt that this was a huge boost to Meciar and his HZDS, 
Smer\'s Robert Fico (who can take credit for boosting 
Gasparovic to the second-round), and Gasparovic himself. 
Coalition politicians can barely speak from surprise and 
 
disappointment. 
 
7. (C) The silver lining may be the wake-up call this 
election sends to the governing coalition, particularly the 
SDKU.  Before the vote, the attitude within the SDKU was one 
of complacency: Kukan was leading in the polls and there was 
smug confidence that all was well.  When recriminations about 
who \"lost\" the election are over (septel), the coalition will 
have no choice but to band together against a stronger common 
enemy or face possible extinction.  There will be less room 
for internal bickering and divisions.  At this time we do not 
believe new elections are in the cards, although that could 
change based on future coalition cooperation. 
 
8. (U) The EU and NATO have not made official comments, but 
European Parliament rapporteur for Slovakia Jan Marinus 
Wiersma expressed disappointment to press that voters in the 
second round will be choosing from two candidates 
representing the old HZDS. 
 
Long Term Significance for U.S. Interests 
----------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) The presidential election will not have much effect 
on U.S. interests.  Either a Meciar or Gasparovic presidency 
will be considerably less forthcoming than Schuster\'s, but 
will have little direct influence on day-to-day engagement 
with us.  There is a possibility of more rhetoric directed 
toward the U.S. from the Presidential Palace, and even more 
so directed at the government.  However, the Slovakia of 2004 
is not the Slovakia of the mid-1990\'s.  Most of the powers 
that Meciar enjoyed as \"pseudo-President\" in 1998-99 have 
been removed or otherwise constrained.  Public expectations 
-- political, economic, and otherwise -- have been shifted in 
ways not easily undone, and bureaucratic structures have been 
reformed.  EU and NATO membership are not only seals of 
approval but constraints on behavior. 
 
11. (C) The political effects are more important. 
Dzurinda\'s government and President Schuster have been 
courageous in standing behind U.S. actions in Afghanistan, 
Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo, both with words and troops.  The 
rest of Slovakia is not convinced.  If the coalition does not 
react responsibly to this defeat, their reform program could 
be threatened, and our expectation of continued support for 
U.S. initiatives could be hurt as well.  The party that most 
staunchly supports the U.S. is the SDKU.  Within the 
coalition, the more isolationist Christian Democrats (KDH) 
were anti-Iraq War (for religious reasons).  The Hungarian 
Coalition Party (SMK) is more stable, but would have trouble 
carrying the water for us given its ethnic minority status. 
ANO may not survive beyond the next election.  Among the 
opposition, both Meciar\'s HZDS and Fico\'s SMER are more 
interested in following the popular mood than defined 
national interests. 
 
Where Should The U.S. Be? 
------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) Given the active and visible U.S. campaign against 
Meciar prior to the September 2002 parliamentary elections, 
the question has arisen as to the U.S. position on this 
election.  We believe the answer should be cautious and 
reflect the significant changes that have occured in this 
country.  It would be a useful lesson for the Slovak 
electorate to see that its vote is respected but that at the 
same time its decisions have consequences.  Our public line 
should be that we respect a democratic vote, encourage 
participation in the electoral process, and are confident 
that the Slovak people will consider Slovakia\'s future when 
they vote.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S INTRODUCTORY CALL WITH NBU CHIEF UGOR 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. RONALD WEISER FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D 
 
1.  (C)  ON MARCH 23 THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH RECENTLY 
    APPOINTED NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICE (NBU) DIRECTOR AUREL UGOR. 
 THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THE USG\'S PLEASURE THAT SOMEONE WHO WAS 
INDEPENDENT AND APOLITICAL HEADING THE NBU.  UGOR THANKED THE 
AMBASSADOR FOR USG AND NATO SUPPORT. 
 
NEW LAW ON CLASSIFIED INFORMATION--IMPERFECT BUT IMPROVED 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2.  (C) UGOR COMMENTED ON THE RECENTLY PASSED LAW ON 
PROTECTION OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, CHARACTERIZING IT AS A 
COMPROMISE.  HE NOTED, IN PARTICULAR, THAT ARTICLE 14--WHICH 
OUTLINES WHO CANNOT RECEIVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE--ALMOST 
CERTAINLY WOULD BE AMENDED IN THE COMING MONTHS.  UGOR STATED 
THAT THE NEW LAW GOVERNING THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NBU 
DIRECTOR WOULD APPLY TO HIM AND THAT HE WOULD SERVE A 7-YEAR 
TERM AND COULD BE RECALLED BY PARLIAMENT OR THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE NUMBER OF EXEMPT 
INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD ACCESS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITHOUT 
UNDERGOING VETTING CONTINUED TO BE VERY BROAD AND THAT THIS 
WAS A CAUSE FOR CONCERN.  UGOR AGREED WITH THIS ASSESSMENT, 
POINTING OUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN POINTS OF COMPROMISE ON 
THE NEW LAW.  HE NOTED THAT THE NBU HAD ONLY BEEN IN 
EXISTENCE FOR THREE YEARS AND WAS STILL PERCEIVED AS A 
RESTRICTIVE BODY.  HE ADDED THAT NATO SECURITY CHIEF WAYNE 
RYCHAK HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THIS ISSUE DURING THEIR 
MEETING IN BRUSSELS IN MID-MARCH. 
 
GOOD RELATIONS WITHIN THE INTEL COMMUNITY 
----------------------------------------- 
 
    4.  (C) WITH REGARD TO THE MECHANICS OF VETTING FOR SECURITY 
CLEARANCES, ONLY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WOULD CONTINUE TO 
DO THEIR OWN CLEARANCES ACCORDING TO THE NEW LAW.  MINISTRY 
OF DEFENSE CLEARANCES, ONCE CONDUCTED BY THE MILITARY 
DEFENSIVE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, WOULD NOW BE MOVED TO THE 
NBU.  UGOR SAID THAT HE WAS PLEASED WITH THE COOPERATION THE 
NBU WAS RECEIVING FROM OTHER AGENCIES IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE 
CLEARANCE APPLICANTS.  HE ADDED THAT THE NEW FORUM THAT 
BROUGHT TOGETHER THE MILITARY DEFENSIVE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
(VOS), MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (VSS), SLOVAK 
INFORMATION SERVICE (SIS), AND SOME POLICE FORCE ELEMENTS 
FACILITATED THE CLEARANCE PROCESS. 
 
STB PURGE NOT REQUIRED BY NATO 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR CLARIFIED ONE POINT UGOR MADE IN AN 
INTERVIEW IN PRAVDA CONCERNING THE REMOVAL OF FORMER MEMBERS 
OF THE COMMUNIST-ERA SECRET SERVICE FROM THE SLOVAK 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THAT THIS 
PURGE WAS NOT A NATO REQUIREMENT.  UGOR SAID THAT HE KNEW 
THIS TO BE THE CASE AND THAT HIS WORDS IN THAT INTERVIEW HAD 
BEEN TAKEN SOMEWHAT OUT OF CONTEXT. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C) IN THIS MEETING, UGOR CAME ACROSS AS THE ALTER EGO TO 
JAN MOJZIS.  UGOR WAS VERY QUIET AND CAUTIOUSLY GUARDED. 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS WILLING TO SPEAK OPENLY WITH THE AMBASSADOR, 
UGOR WAS VERY CAREFUL NOT TO SPEAK OUT OF SCHOOL.  ALTHOUGH 
    UGOR CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS SOME ENGLISH, HE USED AN INTERPRETER 
FOR THIS MEETING.  HE CONTINUES TO STUDY ENGLISH AS HE HAS 
FOUND IT NECESSARY FOR INTERACTING WITH U.S. AND NATO 
OFFICIALS.

DZURINDA`S BIRTHPLACE), HRABUSICE, AND JANOVCE ACCUSED 
LETANOVCE OF VIOLATING A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT AND BUYING LAND 
FOR ROMA CLOSER TO THEIR VILLAGES.  THE HRABUSICE MAYOR 
COMMENTED IN THE ROMA PRESS THAT LETANOVCE HAS NOT DEALT

USDOC FOR EWHITEMAN AND 5102/FOREIGN TRADE ZONES (ITA/IA) 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETRD, ECON, LO 
SUBJECT: FOREIGN FREE TRADE ZONES 
 
REF: STATE 44705 
 
1.  The following is post\'s response to questions raised in 
reftel. 
 
2.  The Customs Act No. 238/2001 of the Collection of Laws as 
later amended defines free customs zones and free customs 
warehouses (in Article 379) as parts of the customs territory 
or premises situated in that territory, separated from the 
rest of it in which: 1) foreign goods are considered for the 
purpose of import duties and commercial policy measures as 
not being on the customs territory, provided they are not 
released for the free circulation regime or placed in another 
customs regime under conditions other than those provided for 
in customs regulations; 2) Slovak goods meet conditions 
according to special regulation (Law 229/1995 of Collection 
of Laws as later amended on Excise Tax on Alcohol) adopting 
measures usually connected with the export of goods, as a 
result of their placement into the free customs area and free 
customs warehouse. Currently there are four areas in Slovakia 
with the valid status of a free customs zone: Zilina in 
Northern Slovakia, Banska Bystrica in Central Slovakia, 
Trencin in Western Slovakia, and Kosice in Eastern Slovakia. 
There are no geographic limitations where free customs zones 
or warehouses can be located. In general, existing zones do 
not play a significant role in Slovakia\'s economy and are not 
an important factor in attracting foreign investment. 
 
3.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF), based on a prior decision 
by the GOS, permits the establishment of free customs zones, 
with an appropriate application, although only Slovak 
citizens are eligible to apply. (NOTE: a Slovak citizen is a 
person or a legal person with a permanent address in the 
Slovak Republic). The MOF, determines which parts of a 
customs territory will form a free customs zone, who the 
operator will be, conditions of the free customs zone, the 
places of entry and exit, and time period for which the free 
customs zone is established. Free customs zones or free 
customs warehouses are subject to supervision by the customs 
authorities. 
 
4.  Both Slovak and foreign goods may be placed in free 
customs zones or free customs warehouses without a time 
limit. Goods entering a free customs zone or free customs 
warehouse do not need to be presented to the customs office, 
or require a customs declaration be lodged. The Customs 
office can require goods that are subject to export duties or 
other export provisions to be identified to local customs 
offices by a person who has placed the goods in the free 
customs zone or free customs warehouse. However, operations 
performed for inward processing within a conditional system 
or under customs surveillance in free customs zones or free 
customs warehouses cannot be performed without a permit from 
a customs office. The customs office shall determine the 
locations inside free customs zones or free customs 
warehouses where processing operations shall be performed. 
 
5.  Any industrial, commercial, or service activity conducted 
in a free customs zone or free customs warehouse must be 
authorized by customs authorities. Such activities must be 
reported in advance to a customs office. Customs offices may 
impose restrictions on activities in free customs zones or 
free customs warehouses depending on the nature of the goods, 
how well customs regulations are honoured, and on the 
provision of guarantees of compliance with customs 
regulations. Foreign goods placed in free customs zones or 
free customs warehouses may be released for free circulation, 
inward processing, readjustment under customs surveillance, 
and temporary use. Certain activities allow goods released to 
a free circulation regime or a temporary import regime (that 
does not entail an application of import duties or measures 
under the state`s agricultural policy or commercial policy) 
to be used or consumed. In this case, customs declarations 
for release to a free circulation regime or temporary import 
regime is not required. Such a declaration shall, however, be 
required if such goods are to be charged against a quota or a 
ceiling. 
 
6.  Instead of free customs zones or free customs warehouses, 
a regime of inward processing is commonly employed in 
Slovakia. As defined by law, an inward processing regime, 
allows goods to pass through one or more processing 
operations within a customs territory in one of two ways. 
First, foreign goods intended for re-export from the customs 
territory in the form of compensatory products without being 
subject to import duties or commercial policy measures (this 
is known as a suspension system). Second, goods released to a 
free circulation regime with repayment or remission of the 
import duties chargeable on such goods, if they are exported 
from the customs territory in the form of compensatory 
products (this is known as a drawback system). The individual 
responsible for processing operations must acquire 
 
authorization from the customs office, and such authorization 
can only be granted to a Slovak citizen.  Processed goods and 
products that will be re-exported are not subject to import 
duties. However, if merchandise that entered the country to 
be processed and then re-exported, is instead released into 
the free circulation regime, a customs debt and any 
compensatory interest will be due. The amount of the customs 
debt shall be determined on the basis of the conditions 
specified for the imported goods at the time of the 
acceptance of the declaration for release of these goods 
under the inward processing regime. The compensation interest 
charge reimburses the state for the difference in revenue it 
received due to the customs debt being settled later.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2019 
TAGS: PGOV, LO 
SUBJECT: KALINAK ON GASPAROVIC: DOTH SMER PROTEST TOO MUCH? 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald Weiser for reason 1.4b. 
 
1. (C) Summary:  SMER leader Robert Kalinak says SMER\'s 
decision to endorse Gasparovic as a \"way to support Kukan 
without supporting Kukan\" was a nonsensical strategy which 
then backfired.  Smer remains committed nevertheless to 
Gasparovic in the second round.  Having a grateful Gasparovic 
in the presidential palace would help Robert Fico\'s prime 
ministerial ambitions after the next parliamentary elections 
-- a more credible explanation for Smer\'s endorsement. 
Ironically, this makes Meciar the (unofficial and 
unacknowledged) government candidate.  End Summary. 
 
Presidential Elections: Smer,s Miscalculation 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (SBU) Smer MP Robert Kalinak told polecoffs that he was 
deeply concerned about Vladimir Meciar,s victory in the 
first round and his likely success in the run-off.  He said 
that Smer made a mistake and miscalculated before the first 
round in deciding to back Ivan Gasparovic, assuming that the 
second round would nevertheless be between Meciar and Kukan. 
Smer party officials had no doubts about Kukan,s victory in 
the second round.  In evaluating the chances of the 
candidates, Smer estimated that about 25 percent of Smer 
voters would support Schuster, but that those who disliked 
him numbered around 60 percent.  About 20 percent of Smer 
voters would support Meciar, but his \"negatives\" were about 
40 percent.  Smer finally chose Gasparovic because he had 
about 25 percent support with low \"negatives.\"  (SMER vice 
chairman Paska told DCM separately that Smer executive 
committee was overwhelmingly in favor of Gasparovic.) 
 
Why Meciar is Dangerous and Gasparovic is Benign 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. (SBU) Kalinak described the differences between Meciar and 
Gasparovic and the problems that would arise if Meciar 
becomes president.  Meciar will have 26 MPs to support his 
policies, unlike Gasparovic, who has no party backing in 
Parliament and therefore is not dangerous.  Kalinak further 
speculated that Meciar may block appointments of some 
ministers in the future and after the elections he could 
exert control not only in parliament (through his MPs), but 
also in the ministries by appointing his own people.  After 
the next parliamentary elections, Kalinak said that he could 
envision a scenario in which Meciar would be president and 
the prime minister and speaker of parliament would also come 
from HZDS.  In Kalinak,s opinion, Meciar is a stronger 
advocate of EU policies than of transatlantic ties and thus 
he will try to be acceptable to the French and Germans and 
ally Slovakia with them. 
 
Let,s Make a Deal 
----------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Kalinak claims that PM Mikulas Dzurinda made a tacit 
agreement with Meciar, such that if SDKU and ANO voters do 
not vote in the run-off, Meciar and HZDS will not oppose GOS 
initiatives.  (Comment: Low voter turnout is expected to 
assist Meciar\'s chances.)  He contrasted SDKU,s behavior 
before the parliamentary elections in 2002 \"when SDKU was 
vocally opposed to Meciar\" and now when they appear to be 
silent about his candidacy.  In Kalinak,s opinion, Meciar 
would sell his party to the highest bidder as long as he is 
president.  Kalinak also said that Meciar approached Smer for 
its support prior to the first round. 
 
Future Coalition Possibilities 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) Kalinak stressed that Smer and he personally tried 
to keep distance from HZDS and Meciar, but in the future this 
may appear more difficult, should Smer and HZDS together gain 
the majority in the next parliamentary election. If Smer 
refuses to cooperate with HZDS, Smer,s voters would not 
understand why they do not want to make a coalition with 
HZDS.  In his view, Meciar could enter a coalition with any 
available party, including SNS or communists, whose 
preferences may grow due to the hardship caused by economic 
reforms. 
 
Why Gasparovic is the Lesser Evil 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) In Kalinak\'s view, Gasparovic was always just number 
two in HZDS, and was just following Meciar,s orders. 
Gasparovic is more pro-Western and supports transatlantic 
policies.  Gasparovic has assured Smer leadership that he 
will no longer seek support from the nationalists, but used 
the opportunity last fall/winter to establish name 
recognition.  Kalinak does not think that Gasparovic will try 
to manipulate the Parliament as Meciar might.  Kalinak said 
that he will participate in several TV discussions and will 
try to appeal to voters to go and vote, warning them that 
 
ignoring the second round will only work to Meciar,s 
benefit. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Others in Smer have told us in the last week that the 
decision to support Gasparovic was contentious within the 
party, and pushed the \"acceptable limits.\"  Nonetheless, Smer 
made the strategic decision to endorse this candidate, and is 
sticking by him.  Ironically, Meciar is now seen as the 
government candidate.  He is considered the \"lesser of two 
evils\" by coalition politicians who fear a Gasparovic victory 
would do nothing but give more impetus to Smer.  Jewish 
community leaders worried in an April 14 meeting with 
Ambassador and Congressman Wexler about anti-Semitic 
tendencies of the nationalists that supported Gasparovic, and 
seemed to prefer a Meciar victory. 
 
8. (C) Kalinak\'s comments about Smer seeking to indirectly 
support Kukan ring hollow.  Several Smer leaders including 
Kalinak told us for months that they would not endorse any 
presidential candidate in the first round.  There was no need 
for them to do so, and they can have had no doubt that their 
endorsement would swing at least a few percentage pioints to 
Gasparovic.  A likelier interpretation is that Fico made a 
calculated decision that a grateful Gasparovic in the 
presidential palace would facilitate his chances to be the 
next prime minister, which would not have been the case with 
a second-round endorsement of Kukan.  Kalinak\'s attempt at 
rationalization is another reminder that Smer remains mindful 
of Washington\'s interest.  It is not the first time Smer 
leaders have attempted to \"spin\" their actions after the 
fact, usually only when they realize we\'ve been paying 
attention.

SUBJECT: ROBERT FICO\'S VIEWS ON ELECTIONS AND ECONOMIC 
 
REFORMS 
 
REF: FEBRUARY 17 WELLS-MCKNIGHT-THAYER E-MAIL 
 
Classified By: Amb. Ronald Weiser for reasons 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  The Ambassador met privately with Robert 
Fico on April 19 to discuss several topics including Ivan 
Gasparovic\'s win over Vladimir Meciar in the presidential 
elections on April 16.  Fico made it clear that Smer would 
not accept any MP defectors from Meciar\'s Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), suggesting that they join other 
parties.  Fico also spoke positively about some of the 
economic reforms the current GOS has implemented and offered 
some modifications he would make as PM.  Fico is starting to 
use less rhetoric and express more policy ideas for a future 
coalition that he might lead, and showed interest in good 
relations with the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
Fico\'s Thoughts About the Elections 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Fico told the Ambassador over lunch at the CMR that 
Gasparovic\'s win over Meciar further highlighted how much 
Meciar\'s support has eroded over time.  Fico indicated that 
Smer would not accept any MP defectors from HZDS, adding that 
he would encourage them to join other parties, including 
Gasparovic\'s Movement for Democracy (HZD).  (Note:  Given 
that HZD is not represented in parliament, any MPS who want 
to leave HZDS might look to join Vojtech Tkac\'s People\'s 
Union (LU) that broke away from HZDS after the 2002 
parliamentary elections as an interim measure.)  Pointing out 
that HZD still garners 3-4 percent popular support without a 
party in parliament, Fico views HZD as a future coalition 
partner for Smer. 
 
Now Focused on 2006 Parliamentary Elections 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) With the failure of the referendum on early 
elections, Fico stated that he is now focused on winning the 
next parliamentary elections, currently scheduled for 2006, 
and becoming prime minister.  He told the Ambassador that 
there is no will within parliament to call for early 
elections because the 90 deputies needed to disband 
parliament are not willing to give up the benefits and pay 
they currently receive.  Recent opinion polls show that 
Fico\'s Smer would be the big winner while most other parties 
in parliament would likely lose seats if the elections were 
held now. 
 
Economic Policies and Reform 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Fico spoke at considerable length about his views on 
the strategy of implementing economic reform and future 
policies he would support.  He opined that when a government 
initiates a reform plan, it should work more closely with the 
opposition because these are long-term measures that will 
likely take longer to implement than the term of the ruling 
government and should remain after the government changes. 
He strongly supports the incentives that the GOS has put into 
place to encourage foreign investment, but added that the 
government should offer incentives to Slovak companies for 
creating jobs at home, which he supported during the 2002 
campaign.  A Smer-led government would leave the corporate 
tax rate and labor law alone, while making some changes to 
personal tax rates and the VAT.  Fico supports increasing the 
VAT on certain items, but lowering it on essentials such as 
gasoline, foodstuffs, books, and transportation like many 
other EU countries. 
 
5.  (C) Fico suggested that Finance Minister Ivan Miklos\'s 
goal of keeping the budget deficit below 3.9 percent of GDP 
to help put Slovakia on an early course to join the Euro zone 
is misguided.  Fico thought that a higher deficit brought 
about by increasing spending on infrastructure and education 
may be worth delaying Slovakia\'s entrance into the Euro zone. 
 He suggested that if the GOS does not spend more money on 
completing major highway projects, such as the north-south 
and east-west highways, and on education, Slovakia might not 
be competitive against countries like Ukraine, Bulgaria, and 
Romania in the future.  Fico expressed his concern that as 
these countries become more attractive to foreign investors 
as they become more stable, and with them having lower wages, 
Slovakia might become less competitive.  He added that the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was willing 
to loan money for these types of projects, but Miklos was 
unwilling to borrow. 
 
 
6.  (C) Fico told the Ambassador that Russian and French 
companies were interested in supplying two reactors at the 
Mohovce nuclear facility.  Mohovce has two completed reactors 
and two more buildings completed which do not yet have 
equipment installed.  He said that a Russian company 
(probably RAO) was willing to finance the project because it 
would generate significant revenue as Europe\'s electricity 
needs continue to grow. 
 
7. (C) Fico indicated that he intended to visit Libya in late 
May now that he has received U.S. assurances that we have no 
objection to such a trip (ref).  He would very much like to 
visit Washington between May 15 and 24 for one or two days 
before he goes to Libya (septel). 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) In this conversation with the Ambassador, Fico 
started to express positive program 
ideas for a future coalition that he envisions heading, 
rather than simply pointing out the faults of Prime Minister 
Dzurinda\'s government.  Fico\'s remarks on economic reform 
suggest that he has accepted the major reforms that Miklos 
has implemented and that his proposals are only tinkering on 
the margins.  The GOS does offer incentives to Slovak 
businesses that create local jobs, but, to date, these 
companies have not had the capital to invest that foreign 
companies bring.  Fico\'s ideas on improving infrastructure 
and education likely will bolster his support.  He used less 
rhetoric than in past meetings and clearly showed he is 
interested in maintaining a good relationship with the U.S.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT-ELECT GASPAROVIC SAYING THE RIGHT THINGS 
 
REF: BRATISLAVA 407 
 
Classified By: Amb. Ronald Weiser for reason 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (U) Introduction/Summary.  On April 17, Ivan Gasparovic 
beat former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar in the 
presidential elections runoff.  In the final round, 
Gasparovic picked up more than 637,000 votes over his showing 
in the first round, receiving support of most of those who 
voted for the first round losers, while Meciar only increased 
his total vote count by about 72,000.  Gasparovic, the 
candidate of a confederation of nationalist parties and 
endorsed by Robert Fico\'s Smer, won in all eight voting 
regions and in 42 out of 50 districts.  Since winning, 
Gasparovic has clarified his views on various issues and has 
stated that the worldwide threat of terrorism has justified 
the presence of Slovak troops in Iraq and that he will try to 
support social and economic reforms while reducing their 
negative impact on citizens.  President Schuster will leave 
office on June 15, when Gasparovic is inaugurated to serve a 
five-year term.  End Introduction/Summary. 
 
Gasparovic Wins as the Lesser Evil 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The presidential runoff held on April 17 was widely 
viewed as a battle between the lesser of two evils. 
Gasparovic was able to pull out the upset over Meciar, who 
has a stable and disciplined electorate, because Gasparovic 
did not have the negative name recognition associated with 
Meciar.  Although Gasparovic was closely associated with 
Meciar during the 1990s, Gasparovic gained votes from people 
who supported Schuster, Foreign Minister Kukan, former 
Ambassador to the U.S. Butora, and Christian Democrat 
candidate Frantisek Miklosko in the first round.  Gasparovic 
would not have won without votes from Prime Minister 
Dzurinda\'s Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKU), Bela 
Bugar\'s Hungarian Coalition Party (SMK), and Pavol 
Hrusovsky\'s Christian Democratic Movement (KDH).  These 
voters chose to ignore their party leaders instructions to 
stay away from the polls.  Many instead chose to vote for 
Gasparovic, whom they viewed as the lesser of two evils. 
 
3.  (C) Several SDKU and ANO contacts told emboffs that 
Meciar, in spite of his murky past, would now behave 
\"responsibly\" and is more predictable that the lesser-known 
Gasparovic, who was supported by Fico\'s populist Smer.  SDKU 
MP Roman Vavrik told emboffs that he expected that Gasparovic 
would assist Fico in reach his goal of becoming prime 
minister, even if that meant early elections.  (See reftel on 
Fico\'s goals.) 
 
Generally Saying the Right Things 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) On April 19, Gasparovic--who once opposed deployment 
of troops to Iraq--told the press that the threat of 
worldwide terrorism justified the presence of Slovak troops 
in Iraq.  He added that each state has an obligation to 
become involved in the fight against terrorism. 
 
5.  (U) Gasparovic has stated publicly that he does not \"owe\" 
anything to Smer, despite the party\'s public support of his 
candidacy.  Fico has echoed those comments, adding that Smer 
will not look to the new president for preferential treatment. 
 
6.  (U) Gasparovic has distanced himself for the time being 
from his alliance with the nationalists that he forged last 
year.  He told the press that the Alliance of Slovak National 
Powers, which he founded, may become a political party in the 
future that would be committed to modern European democratic 
principles.  In addition, he has stated that EU accession 
will be a \"watershed\" event in Slovak-Hungarian relations as 
it will contribute to resolving several issues.  He believes 
that there are sufficient legal rights to ensure the survival 
and promote the development of the Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia, adding that they do not need special treatment. 
 
7.  (U) He has stressed that he will work to improve the 
relationships between the prime minister, the president, and 
the speaker of parliament in the coming months, acknowledging 
that as president, he should not interfere in the coalition\'s 
political disputes.  Gasparovic added that it is the 
president\'s role to submit proposals and seek agreement with 
the government and the parliament. 
 
Comments of Concern 
------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Gasparovic, whose only foreign language is Russian, 
has already indicated his interest in developing 
Slovak-Russian economic ties.  (Note:  He will probably 
receive strong support from Smer as Fico has also been 
interested in increasing business contacts between Moscow and 
Bratislava.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) Presidential elections conveyed a positive message in 
spite of the surprising choice of candidates--democratic 
instincts of Slovak voters are more deeply rooted than many 
believed.  Lacking any clear recommendations from their party 
leaders, voters recognized the extent of damage Meciar\'s 
comeback could do both domestically and abroad, and mobilized 
to prevent it.  Although many questions remain about 
Gasparovic, he has publicly apologized for past mistakes and 
distanced himself from Meciar\'s style of government.  Many 
politicians within SDKU and KDH fear that Gasparovic will 
work closely with Fico.  To date, Gasparovic has not made any 
statements on Roma issues but KDH fears that his nationalist 
tendencies may only further fan existing tensions between 
Slovak and Roma communities.

SUBJECT:  GETTING THE GOOD NEWS OUT ON IRAQ 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: THE COUNTRY TEAM AND I HAVE FOUND, THROUGH 
OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS AROUND SLOVAKIA, THAT PEOPLE ARE 
NOT GETTING ENOUGH FACTUAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
    POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE COALITION\'S EFFORTS IN 
IRAQ.  SLOVAK EDITORIAL OPINION HAS SO FAR REMAINED 
PREDOMINANTLY ON OUR SIDE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, PUBLIC 
OPINION, WHICH SUPPORTS WITHDRAWAL OF SLOVAK TROOPS 
FROM IRAQ, IS CAUSING POLITICAL LEADERS TO BEGIN TO ASK 
FOR DISCUSSIONS ON THIS ISSUE.  MUCH OF THIS PRESSURE 
IS BECAUSE THE NEWS MEDIA CONTAINS MOSTLY INFORMATION 
ON FIGHTING AND CASUALTIES AND NOT ON THE PROGRESS MADE 
IN REBUILDING IRAQ AND PREPARING IT FOR DEMOCRATIC SELF- 
RULE.  THEREFORE, PUBLIC IMPRESSIONS ARE THAT TROOPS 
ARE IN IRAQ TO FIGHT A WAR AND NOT TO STABILIZE THE 
COUNTRY FOR THE REBUILDING EFFORTS AND THE CREATION OF 
A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.  THE RECENT ROUNDTABLES FOR 
CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNALISTS WITH SECRETARY POWELL AND 
SECRETARY RUMSFELD WERE ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN 
 
SIPDIS 
GETTING FRONT-PAGE STORIES, BUT THE NUMBER OF THOSE 
OPPORTUNITIES IS LIMITED.  WE ARE LOOKING FOR MORE WAYS 
TO REACH A LARGER AUDIENCE, GIVEN THE RESOURCE 
LIMITATIONS OF OUR POST.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  MEMBERS OF COUNTRY TEAM AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE 
CERTAIN ADDITIONAL TOOLS THE DEPARTMENT COULD PROVIDE 
THAT WOULD BE OF ASSISTANCE TO US AND SIMILAR POSTS IN 
CENTRAL EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE: 
 
A)  MORE GENERIC OP-EDS FOR PLACEMENT UNDER THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S NAME.  THE GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONG PEOPLE 
IN THE PUBLIC OPINION BUSINESS IS THAT ARTICLES BY THE 
U.S. AMBASSADOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE READ THAN 
ARTICLES BY A HIGHER-RANKING AMERICAN LEADER WITH NO 
LOCAL TIES. 

WE DO NOT HAVE THE STAFF OR RESOURCES TO WRITE OP-EDS 
FROM SCRATCH, AND IT SEEMS INEFFICIENT FOR EVERY POST 
TO BE WRITING ITS OWN.  WE WOULD MAKE GOOD USE OF MORE 
GENERIC OP-EDS THAT EXPLAIN THE COALITION MISSION AND 
THAT HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE \"GOOD NEWS\" ASPECTS THAT ARE 
NOT GETTING THROUGH IN DAILY NEWS STORIES. 
 
B) OFFICIAL SPEAKERS:  WE COULD MAKE GOOD USE OF 
OFFICIAL USG SPEAKERS WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE 
FACTS ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ AND CAN REFUTE 
MISINFORMATION AND INCORRECT PERCEPTIONS.  WHAT WE NEED 
IS SPEAKERS WHO CAN PROVIDE VIVID EXAMPLES AND WHO 
WOULD MAKE GOOD GUESTS ON TELEVISION TALK SHOWS, GOOD 
INTERVIEW SUBJECTS FOR THE PRESS, AND GOOD SPEAKERS IN 
PUBLIC FORUMS.  A FEW WELL-CHOSEN SPEAKERS TRAVELING TO 
VARIOUS POSTS COULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION. 
 
WHILE IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO SECURE PEOPLE THROUGH THE 
P.A. SPEAKERS PROGRAM, THAT PROGRAM RELIES ON SPEAKERS 
WHO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AND NOT AS OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT 
SPOKESPERSONS.  WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES TO FUND 
SPEAKERS (OUR FY-04 FUNDS ARE ALREADY EXHAUSTED), AND 
SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER UTILIZED IN THIS CASE BY 
VISITING MULTIPLE COUNTRIES. 
 
C)  DIGITAL VIDEO CONFERENCES ARE USUALLY DEMAND- 
DRIVEN, BUT IT COULD BE USEFUL TO TRY A SUPPLY-DRIVEN 
APPROACH.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOMEONE WITH A COMPELLING STORY 
TO TELL ABOUT THE REVIVAL OF THE HOSPITAL SECTOR IN 
IRAQ COULD BE OFFERED TO POSTS AS A DVC GUEST. 

3.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN 
ADDRESSING THIS PUBLIC INFORMATION ISSUE.

President of the Slovak Republic 
 
Bratislava, 4 May 2004 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
In connection with my forthcoming departure from the 
office of head of state, which I have held since June 
1999, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you 
in recognition of your exceptional contribution to the 
development of Slovak-American relationships during this 
period thanks to your good will towards Slovakia and its 
citizens. 
 
I consider the past five years of our mutual relations to 
have been an exceptionally productive time, thanks in 
part to our direct personal dialogue.  In this I see a 
good basis for the future and it is my belief that you 
will also continue to develop and enhance the ties of 
mutual solidarity with my successor to this office, 
particularly since we have recently become a member 
country of the North Atlantic Alliance. 
 
It is with pleasure that I look back on our meetings, 
which were held in the spirit of friendship and supported 
my opinion of you as a great leader and a man of 
decisions.  It is my belief that history will objectively 
judge all of your personal and political actions which 
you have undertaken during your term of office in one of 
the most important positions in world politics.  One of 
the most debated decisions was the military intervention 
in Iraq and the toppling of the dictatorial regime of 
Saddam Hussein.  I am convinced that this action was 
justified, and history will show the correctness of this 
decision.  I know from personal experience that those who 
take brave and pioneering decisions seldom receive 
acknowledgment at the time.  It is only after an 
appropriate interval, when passion subsides and reality 
resurfaces, that the scales tip in their favour. 
 
Your Excellency, I would also like to take this 
opportunity to acknowledge the high quality of the 
successful mission of the Ambassador of the United States 
of America to the Slovak Republic, Mr. Ronald Weiser, who 
undertook a great deal of work for the development of 
Slovak-American cooperation in all areas of our joint 
interests.  I would like to emphasise that the Ambassador 
had a significant role in the exceptional development of 
Slovak-American relations and political dialogue, which 
thanks to his endeavours reached a level of intensity and 
quality which they had never previously attained.  I 
particularly value his work in the area of the 
development of economic cooperation and in the 
presentation of business and investment opportunities in 
Slovakia for American businessmen.  I am greatly 
appreciative of the productive contacts of Ambassador 
Weiser with Slovak constitutional bodies, his untiring 
work meeting citizens from all the regions of Slovakia 
and his excellent preparation which enabled him to better 
understand Slovakia.  I would like to state that I 
consider him to be one of the very best ambassadors with 
which I have had the opportunity to cooperate. 
 
I should like in conclusion, Your Excellency, to assure 
you that I remain an ardent supporter of the systematic 
development of Slovak-American relations.  I shall also 
continue to support you in the fight against 
international terrorism and the defence of human rights 
worldwide.  I am certain that your eminent qualities and 
professional attributes will again ensure your victory in 
the forthcoming presidential elections, and in this 
regard I would like to express my personal support to 
you.  I would consider it as an honour, if we maintained 
our good personal contacts in the future. 
 
In conclusion, I would like to express to you my deepest 
respect and I also wish you and your dear wife Laura all 
the best. 
 
His Excellency 
 
George W. Bush 
President of the United States of America 
 
Washington

NEW ALARMS DIRECTLY LINKED TO EMERGENCY SERVICES.  THE 
EMBASSY IS EXPLORING A DONATION OF SURPLUS COMPUTERS OR 
OFFICE FURNITURE TO GET THIS NGO (A FORMER DEMOCRACY 
    COMMISSION GRANTEE) BACK ON ITS FEET.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. ON THE EVENING OF MAY 6, AN ARSONIST SET FIRE TO THE 
OFFICE PREMISES OF PEOPLE AGAINST RACISM, AN NGO THAT 
MONITORS THE NEO-NAZI MOVEMENT IN SLOVAKIA.  AN EMPLOYEE OF 
THE ORGANIZATION WAS IN THE OFFICE, NOTICED THE FIRE, AND 
WAS ABLE TO ALERT AUTHORITIES QUICKLY.  THE GROUP\'S 
COMPUTERS, PHOTOCOPIER, AND OTHER OFFICE EQUIPMENT WERE 
DESTROYED, WITH NO INSURANCE.  ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTOR, 
THE GROUP RECEIVES E-MAIL AND PHONE THREATS FREQUENTLY, BUT 
HAD DOWNPLAYED THE POTENTIAL SECURITY THREAT TO ITS OFFICE 
AND STAFF.  SKINHEADS ALSO PHYSICALLY ATTACKED THREE 
ACTIVISTS LAST WEEK WHILE THEY HUNG POSTERS FOR A PAR EVENT. 
AFTER A STAFF MEMBER CAME TO THEIR AID, THE SKINHEADS FIRED 
UPON THEM FROM FOUR TO FIVE METERS AWAY WHILE LEAVING THE 
SCENE. 
 
3. SKINHEAD VIOLENCE USUALLY COINCIDES WITH SPORTING EVENTS 
OR ANNIVERSARIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRST SLOVAK STATE, 
WHICH WAS A NAZI PUPPET REGIME. PEOPLE AGAINST RACISM 
SUGGESTED THAT THE INCIDENT WAS PLANNED NEAR THE PUBLIC 
HOLIDAY THAT COMMEMORATES THE END OF WORLD WAR II IN 
SLOVAKIA.  SPECIAL ADVISOR FOR RACIALLY MOTIVATED CRIME AT 
THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR PAVOL DRAXLIR TOLD POLOFF THAT 
TENSIONS ROSE LAST WEEK AFTER NEO-NAZIS ATTACKED A 54-YEAR 
OLD ISRAELI CITIZEN AT A BUS STATION, WHO DEFENDED HIMSELF 
WITH A KNIFE AND KILLED HIS ATTACKER.  JANA KVIECINSKA, THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE SECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AT THE GOVERNMENT 
OFFICE, TOLD POLOFF THAT THESE LATEST CONFRONTATIONS PROVE 
THAT THE WORK OF PEOPLE AGAINST RACISM IS IMPORTANT AND 
WORTHWHILE. 

4. POLICE ESTIMATE THAT SLOVAKIA HAS 500 ACTIVE NEO-NAZI 
MEMBERS AND NEARLY 3000 SYMPATHIZERS. THIS YEAR, POLICE 
DEVOTED MORE RESOURCES TO THIS ISSUE, BUT OFFENSES HAVE NOT 
DECREASED AND PROSECUTION REMAINS WEAK.  THE POLICE OFFERED 
PEOPLE AGAINST RACISM SHORT-TERM PROTECTION AND WILL CONNECT 
NEW ALARMS DIRECTLY LINKED TO EMERGENCY SERVICES. IN THE 
FUTURE, THE ORGANIZATION IS LIKELY TO RELOCATE CLOSER TO 
POLICE HEADQUARTERS.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/15/2019 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, LO 
SUBJECT: FICO PREPARED FOR CRITICISM DURING WASHINGTON VISIT 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald Weiser for reason 1.4(b). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Robert Fico, the most popular politicaian in 
Slovakia, will visit Washington May 17-19.  Fico has a major 
influence on public opinion and has told the Ambassador on 
several occasions that he wants good relations with the U.S., 
but his public statements are often unhelpful.  Fico hopes 
his visit to Washington will help policy makers get to know 
\"Slovakia\'s future Prime Minister.\"  He should hear a tough 
message about how the U.S. views the limits of discourse 
between friends and allies.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Robert Fico\'s Smer (\"Direction\") party consistently 
leads popularity polls with 27-30 percent voter support. 
Leading Smer members include businessmen and professionals, 
but the party\'s main support is found among young voters and 
less-educated voters.  Fico is in a permanent campaign as 
leader of the main opposition party to discredit the Dzurinda 
government by criticizing foreign policy and domestic 
reforms.  One Smer MP told us that his party was happy with 
many of the current government\'s economic reforms.  He said 
the situation Smer will inherit after 2006 elections will 
have greatly benefited from all the tough measures.  Then he 
smiled and added, \"But now we\'re an opposition party so, of 
course, we oppose everything.\"  Therefore, it is important to 
keep in mind that the \"populist\" line Fico uses in public 
often differs greatly from what Smer MP\'s and Fico himself 
tell us in private. 
 
Foreign Policy 
-------------- 
 
3. (C) Because Fico\'s public statements are not always 
reflective of what he says privately, and because as an 
opposition leader he needs certain political space to 
maneuver, we don\'t take everything he says at face value, or 
as indicative of the policy he might adopt if he becomes 
prime minister.  That said, sometimes he goes too far.  For 
example, on private TV JOJ on May 8, 2004 Fico said that 
&the attack on Iraq was about natural resources and that was 
the main reason why force was used in Iraq.8  He also 
claimed that PM Dzurinda was lying about Iraq having barrels 
full of weapons of mass destruction and links with terrorism. 
 The Ambassador spoke to him on these remarks, noting that 
even in opposition there was a line between what is 
acceptable criticism and what is simply spreading lies.  The 
Ambassador warned Fico that his visit to Washington would not 
be a mere exchange of pleasantries, but that he should be 
prepared for some constructive criticism about how \"friends 
of the U.S.\" behave.  Fico has called for a parliamentary 
debate on examining the performance of Slovak troops in Iraq 
and discussing the possibility of their withdrawal absent a 
UN mandate.  This debate was originally scheduled for May 12, 
but President of Parliament Hrusovsky postponed the 
discussion until June. 
 
4. (U) On April 10, when parliament debated the ratification 
of NATO accession treaty, Fico stated: 8I do not perceive 
any kind of festive atmosphere. There are many reasons for 
that.  NATO as an organization preferred to adhere to 
international law, instead of sanctioning unilateral military 
action against Iraq by the United States.  In spite of that, 
the citizens of Slovakia tend to connect NATO primarily with 
that great superpower and with its style of asserting its own 
national interests...In our opinion, the assault on Iraq is a 
gross violation of international law, which was also espoused 
by the Government of Slovakia.  The background of the assault 
needs to be seen as being motivated by narrow economic 
interests.  I wish to express my regrets that the GOS did not 
even find the courage, although the war in Iraq provided many 
opportunities for that, to sharply condemn the killing of 
civilians, mostly women and children, as a result of allied 
attacks.8 
 
5. (SBU) Fico is generally favorable to America and wants 
good relations with the United States, but he does not always 
have pro-U.S. instincts.  He also gives heavy consideration 
to Russian economic opportunities.  Fico started studying 
English five years ago; before that his only foreign language 
was Russian.  He knows English is the language of Slovakia\'s 
future, but he also values strong ties to Russia and other 
former USSR states. 
 
6. (C) An example was his controversial June 2003 trip to 
Belarus.  Belarusian state television used the visit for 
propaganda, claiming that the country is not isolated.  Fico 
neither met opposition representatives nor discussed human 
rights issues. He later defended the visit by explaining that 
he concluded interesting business contracts during his trip. 
Fico learned a lesson from the criticism, and vetted his 
upcoming trip to Libya with the U.S. before firming plans. 
 
He wants to resume traditional business ties between Slovakia 
and Libya. 
 
Domestic Policy 
------------------ 
 
7. (U) Fico represents the center-left in Slovakia, and as 
such publicly opposes all of the Dzurinda government\'s 
economic reforms as too harsh on ordinary people.  Smer 
endorsed the candidacy of Ivan Gasparovic, who will be 
inaugurated as President June 15.  Both Gasparovic and Fico 
insist they have no longer-term political agreement. 
 
8. (SBU) Fico generally supports greater social benefits for 
Slovak citizens, but capitalizes on anti-Roma sentiment by 
proposing to limit benefits.  In January 2004 he recommended 
urgent measures because by 2015 there would be more than 1 
million Roma living in Slovakia, out of which 800 thousand 
would be dependent on social benefits.  In February 2004 Fico 
protested against the measures implemented by GOS to help 
Roma, saying &The rules have to be clear for Roma: First of 
all obligations and then rights.  We are very much aware of 
who the Roma are who want to do nothing for the state and who 
simply ask for social security.8 
 
9. (U) In April 2004 the Confederation of Labor Unions (KOZ), 
claiming to have 600 thousand members, announced that it had 
made an agreement on cooperation with Fico,s SMER.  KOZ 
leader Saktor said they will strive to integrate the left of 
center political parties and that KOZ would support SMER in 
the next parliamentary elections. 
 
Management Style 
---------------- 
 
10. (C) Many Smer MP\'s have told us that the reason they were 
attracted to join the party is that they knew Fico and had 
been personally persuaded to enter politics with him.  They 
say he is an open person who lets everyone express his/her 
ideas before making a decision.  Others tell a different tale 
of rigid, top-down management.  SDKU MP Vavrik, who co-chairs 
the defense committee led by SMER MP Kalinak, told us that 
before agreeing to anything, Kalinak goes into the hallway to 
call Ficoand get his blessing.  Kalinak has also privately 
expressed surprise to embassy officers when told of certain 
Fico public statements. 
 
11. (C) It is no secret among the political class that the 
man behind Fico, wealthy businessman Fedor Flasik, develops 
the public message and orchestrates the series of press 
conferences and media appearances to keep Fico\'s name in the 
headlines.  Flasik\'s strategy is to be outrageous in order to 
attract media attention and stay at the top of the polls. 
While it has its intended effect with potential voters, the 
disconnect between what Fico says publicly and privately have 
earned him the reputation of being unreliable, or at least 
unpredictable, among possible coalition partners.  This is 
also considered by many political analysts to be the 
explanation for his surprise defeat in the September 2002 
parliamentary elections, as doubts about where he really 
stood on the issues caused voters to be cautious once they 
got into the voting booth. 
 
Themes for Discussions 
------------------------------ 
 
12. (C) Fico is articulate and clever, and should be given 
the opportunity to present himself.  He should also hear the 
U.S. point of view along the following lines: 
 
-- We respect the role of an opposition politician, and 
believe it is important in a democracy to foster healthy 
debate on issues. 
 
-- Nonetheless, there is a line of responsibility that a 
friend of the U.S. and NATO ally should not cross. 
 
-- Perpetuating myths such as \"the invasion of Iraq was only 
for oil\" and calling leaders who feared Iraq\'s WMD capacity 
\"liars\" is crossing that line. 
 
-- It is true that \"actions speak,\" but words matter too.  We 
register everything you say.  Speaking against the U.S. as 
part of a populist political platform will damage your 
credibility with us.  You will note that even at the height 
of disagreements with our European friends we -- and they -- 
do not question motives and principles. 
 
-- Being a true leader doesn\'t mean just polling voters and 
repeating their sentiments.  It also means taking a 
principled stand and convincing your supporters to go along 
 
with it.  This is especially relevant in foreign policy areas.

SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT ADOPTS ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAW 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - protect accordingly 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. On May 20, the Slovak Parliament 
adopted the Law on Equal Treatment. The Director of the 
GOS Human Rights Section of the Government Office, Jana 
Kviecinska, told POL Specialist that this is one of the 
most important laws adopted in the post-communist 
parliament and brings Slovakia into full compliance 
with EU Directives pertaining to Race and Employment. 
The law defines discrimination, establishes the legal 
basis for positive discrimination or \"affirmative 
action,\" and amends articles in the labor code and 
those pertaining to social sectors, such as education, 
health, and state service. The Slovak National Human 
Rights Center (SNHRC) can also now represent citizens 
in discrimination complaints and monitor the 
implementation of the law. Justice Minister Daniel 
Lipsic, a KDH member, announced he will challenge the 
law in Constitutional Court because of positive 
discrimination provisions. End Summary. 
 
Anti-Discrimination Law Passes 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Slovakia\'s new anti-discrimination law prohibits 
discrimination \"for any reason.\" The law passed with 
103 out of 133 votes, with support from both the 
coalition and the opposition. After the president signs 
the law, it will become effective July 1, 2004. The law 
defines discrimination, sexual harassment, and 
sanctions based on complaints. In addition, it 
describes how to promote equal treatment in the labor 
market and social sectors through positive 
discrimination or \"affirmative action.\" 
 
3. (SBU) The Roma plenipotentiary Klara Orgovanova 
welcomed the new legislation that may help Roma resolve 
lingering inequalities in housing, employment, and 
education. According to Orgovanova, Slovak Roma do not 
enjoy the same rights as the non-Roma population and 
now will have more legal recourse. She mentioned the 
law will help eliminate certain discriminatory 
behaviors in the future, such as refusing admittance to 
certain schools or public areas. However, she asserted 
that this law is not only to protect the rights of the 
minorities, but all of society. 
 
Compromise Reached with KDH 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Kviecinska\'s office drafted this legislation in 
accordance with the Action Plan to Prevent All Forms of 
Discrimination, Racism, Xenophobia, Anti-Semitism and 
other forms of Intolerance for the Period 2000-2001. 
The Christian Democratic Party (KDH) stalled the 
legislation due to objections about references to 
sexual orientation by removing discussion about the 
anti-discrimination legislation from the Parliamentary 
agenda in 2002. The Hungarian Coalition Party (SMK) 
retained the passage of the law as a part of their 
platform and continued to submit drafts to the 
government. Justice Minister Lipsic, a KDH member and 
Chairman of the Legislative Council, also disagreed 
with the necessity of one single anti-discrimination 
norm and proposed to amend 14 other relevant laws. A 
compromise was finally reached that combined the Human 
Rights Section\'s draft with the amendment of several 
other relevant codes according to the Lipsic proposal. 
 
6. (U) The resulting legislation maintained some 
reference to sexual orientation, but it was not 
repeated in all subsequent amendments. Legal experts 
stated that while sexual orientation is addressed in 
relation to labor, omitting health and education, 
Slovakia is now obliged to follow EU standards in other 
areas and it can be perceived as a victory. HZDS MP 
Ludmila Muskova introduced a vague amendment that 
prohibits in schools \"the influence of sexual 
orientation in contradiction to traditional European 
values.\" In a later interview, she stated that the 
language was not directed against homosexuality, but 
pedophilia and sexually deviant crimes. Others claimed 
that this could also protect against teaching beliefs 
and ideas counter to the EU Charter on Human Rights in 
schools. 
 
Positive Discrimination Questioned 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Lipsic announced that he will challenge the law 
in Constitutional Court due to references to positive 
discrimination. He claimed these provisions contradict 
the constitution because it promotes stereotypes about 
minorities. The Section for Human Rights stated that 
positive discrimination was a necessary, albeit 
temporary measure, for certain populations afflicted by 
discrimination to protect their rights. Roma leaders 
appealed to Lipsic not to question the merits of the 
positive discrimination, which could provide 
unparalleled opportunities for Roma. 
 
8. (U) Balasz Jarabik, a legal expert for the Slovak- 
Hungarian think-tank Kalligram, was surprised 
Parliament passed this section of the law. He stated 
that while it is a very important concept for Slovakia 
it lacks simple implementation measures and could be 
abused. The Director of Milan Simecka, a human rights 
organization, welcomed discussion about positive 
discrimination at the constitutional level. He stated 
that positive discrimination is an internationally 
recognized theme found in many United Nations documents 
and it should be determined what form is acceptable in 
the Slovak context. 
 
More Access to Legal Representation

9. (SBU) The new Act on Equal Treatment also extends 
the responsibilities of the Slovak National Human 
Rights Center (SNHRC) to represent citizens in 
administrative proceedings if their rights were 
violated. The Center will also monitor and assess the 
application of this law in Slovakia. Jana Kovacova, 
from the Education and Research Section at SNHRC, 
stated that their center must quickly adjust to the new 
character of their work, but feared without new budget 
appropriations they will not be prepared by July 1. 
Parliament substantially decreased their budget this 
year in reaction to prior management problems. 
 
Comment

10. (U) Many activists and politicians who devoted 
several years to lobbying for the anti-discrimination 
legislation celebrated its passage last week. 
International organizations and American consultants 
also supported these efforts and helped to draft the 
initial legislation. After the long political battle 
fought, activists commented that the anti- 
discrimination is not a perfect piece of legislation, 
but it is an important legal development for Slovakia 
to protect human rights. The government must now follow- 
up with efforts to increase public awareness about anti- 
discrimination. It is too soon to tell what the 
practical effects of the legislation will be. As we 
discuss the details with government and legal experts, 
as well as human rights and minority activists, we will 
continue to report on the impact of the law and 
changing conditions for minorities in Slovakia.

YEMEN, AFGHANISTAN, OR AZERBAIJAN 
 
REF: A. STATE 68238 
 
         B. BRATISLAVA 436 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: DCM SCOTT N. THAYER FOR REASON 1.4 (B). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY AND REQUEST FOR GUIDANCE: PETER PENIASKA, HEAD 
OF THE SLOVAK ARMS FIRM PETINA INTERNATIONAL, IS SEEKING THE 
USG POSITION ON POTENTIAL SALES OF SLOVAK MILITARY EQUIPMENT 
TO LIBYA AND OTHER COUNTRIES.  PETINA IS ACTING AS A 
MIDDLEMAN TO ASSIST THE GOS IN DISPOSING OF STOCKPILED OR 
SURPLUS MILITARY MATERIEL.  HIS PROPOSALS ARE NOT FORMAL GOS 
INITIATIVES.  PENIASKA PROPOSED SELLING T-72 TANK PARTS TO 
LIBYA.  POST REQUESTS GUIDANCE AS TO WHETHER THE USG 
CONSIDERS THESE LETHAL EXPORTS PER REFTEL A.  WE ALSO REQUEST 
INFORMATION ON ANY OBJECTIONS THE USG WOULD HAVE TO THE OTHER 
POTENTIAL SALES, IN ANTICIPATION OF ENGAGING THE SLOVAK 
AUTHORITIES IF PETINA DECIDES TO MOVE FORWARD.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) ON 24 MAY 2004, PETER PENIASKA, HEAD OF THE SLOVAK 
ARMS FIRM PETINA INTERNATIONAL, ASKED TO SPEAK WITH EMBOFF TO 
FOLLOW UP ON PRIOR DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING POTENTIAL SLOVAK 
ARMS SALES (REFTEL B).  PENIASKA, WHO WOULD RECEIVE A 
COMMISSION ON ANY FUTURE SALES, CONTINUES TO BE SOMEWHAT 
CRYPTIC AND RELUCTANT TO SHARE DETAILS.  WHEN EMBOFF DIRECTLY 
QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT HIS MOTIVES, HE STATED THAT HE DECIDED 
TO SPEAK WITH A USG REPRESENTATIVE ON THE ISSUES BELOW AFTER 
TALKING TO SLOVAK MINISTER OF FINANCE IVAN MIKLOS.  IN THE 
ORIGINAL, EARLIER DISCUSSION, PENIASKA HAD REFUSED TO 
IDENITIFY POTENTIAL RECIPIENT COUNTRIES FOR THE POSSIBLE SALE 
OF ASSAULT RIFLES. IN THIS SECOND DISCUSSION, HE AT FIRST DID 
NOT WANT TO SAY MORE THAN THAT THE COUNTRY WAS LOCATED IN 
AFRICA. EMBOFF PRESSED HIM, AND HE FINALLY DISCLOSED THAT THE 
    RECIPIENT WOULD BE CAMEROON. (COMMENT: PENIASKA IS CLEARLY 
TRYING TO GET AN ADVANCE READOUT ON HOW USG WILL REACT SHOULD 
THE SLOVAK GOVERNMENT DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ANY OF THE 
ARMS SALES DESCRIBED BELOW. END COMMENT.) 
 
3. (C) ACCORDING TO PENIASKA, THE SLOVAK GOVERNMENT COULD 
SELL 30,000 TYPE 58 ASSAULT RIFLES PLUS 40 MILLION ROUNDS OF 
AMMUNITION TO EITHER AFGHANISTAN OR CAMEROON. IF SOLD TO 
CAMEROON, THEY WOULD BE DESTINED FOR USE BY THE POLICE OR 
ARMED FORCES. 
 
4. (C) PENIASKA ALSO DESCRIBED A SECOND POTENTIAL ARMS SALE 
FOR SOME 150 T-72 TANKS, PLUS AMMUNITION.  POTENTIAL 
CUSTOMERS FOR THESE TANKS WERE THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE (MOD) 
IN YEMEN OR THE MOD IN AZERBAIJAN.  BOTH THESE COUNTRIES HAD 
EXPRESSED INTEREST IN BUYING THE SLOVAK TANKS, ALTHOUGH THE 
YEMENI MOD HAD NOT YET PRESENTED AN END USER CERTIFICATE. 
THE TANKS WERE ABOUT 12 YEARS OLD AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, 
BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT BEEN USED MUCH. ABOUT 50 OF THE TANKS 
HAD ORIGINAL (RUSSIAN) RANGE FINDERS, AND THE REMAINDER WERE 
EQUIPPED WITH LASER/OPTICAL RANGE FINDERS. 
 
5. (C) A THIRD POSSIBLE SALE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS TO 
LIBYA.  PENIASKA NOTED THAT LIBYA HAD ABOUT A USD 850 MILLION 
DEBT TO THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND SLOVAKIA; APPROXIMATELY USD 
200 MILLION OF THIS WAS DUE SLOVAKIA.  PENIASKA NOTED THAT HE 
HAD RECENTLY MET WITH THE LIBYAN AMBASSADOR TO SLOVAKIA AND 
THE LIBYAN MILITARY ATTACHE TO DISCUSS WAYS FOR LIBYA TO 
BEGIN REPAYING THE DEBT GRADUALLY.  THE LIBYAN OFFICIALS 
NOTED THAT THEY NEEDED SPARE PARTS FOR THEIR AGING T-72 
TANKS, AND THEY TALKED ABOUT A SPECIFIC POTENTIAL SALE OF 
    TANK SPARE PARTS WORTH USD 12 MILLION.  THE SLOVAKS INTENDED 
TO WORK TOGETHER WITH UNNAMED CZECH ARMS FIRMS TO FULFILL 
THIS DEAL, SHOULD IT GO FORWARD.  PENIASKA HAD SHARED THE 
DETAILS OF THIS DISCUSSION WITH MINISTER MIKLOS, WHO SAID HE 
WOULD SUPPORT SUCH A SALE AS LONG AS THE USG WAS NOT OPPOSED. 
 PENIASKA ADDED THAT HE HAD BEEN INVITED TO GO TO TRIPOLI TO 
DISCUSS 
DETAILS OF A DEAL AND HAD ORIGINALLY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION, 
BUT ON THE ADVICE OF MIKLOS HE CANCELLED THE TRIP PENDING A 
READOUT FROM USG ON POSSIBILITIES OF COMPLETING THIS SALE. 
PENIASKA CLAIMED THAT IF HE DOES GO TO LIBYA, HE INTENDS TO 
DISCUSS BROADER ISSUES OF TRADE AND SALES BETWEEN THE TWO 
COUNTRIES, NOT JUST MILITARY ARMS DEALS.  FOR INSTANCE, LIBYA 
WANTS TO BUILD A POWER PLANT, AND THE SLOVAKS INTEND TO 
PROPOSE PROVIDING MATERIALS TO HELP WITH THIS PROJECT. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT AND REQUEST FOR GUIDANCE: THE GOS ITSELF HAS 
NOT ENGAGED US ON ANY POSSIBLE ARMS SALES, SO PENIASKA\'S 
REQUEST FOR USG APPROVAL IS AHEAD OF THE CURVE.  NONETHELESS, 
IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE GOS MIGHT DECIDE TO PURSUE ONE OR 
MORE OF THE SCENARIOS OUTLINED BY PENIASKA, WE REQUEST 
GUIDANCE ON THE USG REACTION TO THESE POTENTIAL DEALS.

On May 11, 2004, EXBS Advisor attended a Country Law 
Enforcement Working Group Meeting hosted by the 
American Embassy in Bratislava.  In attendance were Rob 
Myers, Embassy Regional Security Officer; Bill Flanagan 
and Daron Mrkva, Customs Attach Office Vienna; Jason 
Andrise, U.S. Secret Service; Deputy Director Imrich 
Schlosser, Border and Alien Police, Unit to Fight

Each attendee described his/her duties and then broke 
into smaller groups to discuss specific issues and 
concerns with their counterparts.  EXBS Advisor met 
with Deputy Director Schlosser, Border and Alien 
Police, and discussed the upcoming RADACAD Training as 
well as equipment and training needs for the Border and 
Alien Police.  Deputy Director Schlosser is very 
interested in finding funding for English language 
training for his officers on the Shengen border. 
Later, the American contingent attended a luncheon at 
the DCM\'s residence to discuss our impressions from the 
meeting. 
 
On May 18, 2004, EXBS Advisor traveled with Slovak 
Directorate of Customs Director Eva Luteranova and 
Roman Marovec, Head of Border Crossing Control Section 
to Kosice Airport and the port of Vysne Nemecke on the 
Ukraine border.  The purpose of the trip was to observe 
the Customs operations and complete an assessment at 
those locations.  Photographs were taken of the 
Rapiscan Pallet X-ray System, for which EXRBS will be 
funding repairs and the Eberline Portal Monitors, for 
which EXRBS will be funding the upgrade to include 
Neutron detection capability.  We also visited the

On May 23, 2004, EXBS Advisor traveled to Ljubljana, 
Slovenia to meet with TDY EXBS Advisor Kevin Cummings 
and pick up thirteen Panasonic Lap Top computers for 
delivery to Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia as a 
follow up to the NIPS training that was conducted in 
August of 2003. 
 
On May 25, 2004, EXBS Advisors Adkins and Cummings met 
with Charge-De-Affairs Janet Garvey and Keith Mines 
(Pol/Mil Officer) at the AMEmbassy in Budapest to 
introduce new EXBS Advisor Larry Adkins and discuss the 
status of EXBS Program in the Hungary.  EXBS Advisors 
and Mr. Mines then met with Hungarian Customs and 
Finance Guard Deputy Head of Department Adrienn Magyari 
where we delivered four laptop computers, with NIPS 
software, as part of the NIPS training that was 
conducted last August.  We also discussed having a 
press conference during the official delivery of the 
Mobile X-Ray Van that is to arrive in country on June 
14, 2004. Press conference and official delivery date 
will be in late June or early July 2004. 
 
EXBS Advisors and Mr. Mines met with Mr. Gyula Kocsis, 
Director General of the Hungarian Trade Licensing 
Office.  The purpose of the meeting was to introduce 
new EXBS Advisor Larry Adkins.  We discussed their use 
of the Tracker System and how they adapted the system 
to better meet their needs; the ICP training they 
received and their outreach program; and the Hungarian 
translation of the new EU laws governing export 
licensing.  Mr. Kocsis indicated that the translation 
was poorly done and stated that they are trying to find 
funding to have an NGO translate the new law into 
proper Hungarian.  EXBS should determine if any funding 
is available to help with this project. 
 
 
EXBS Advisors and Mr. Mines also met with Major General 
Jozsef Bendek, National Commander of the Hungarian 
Border Guard.  The purpose of the meeting was to 
introduce new EXBS Advisor Larry Adkins and deliver two 
laptop computers, with NIPS software, as part of the 
NIPS training that was conducted last August.  The 
Hungarian Border Guard requested any assistance we 
could provide in soliciting U.S. Border Patrol 
participation at the International Border Guard 
Conference to be held in Helsinki, Finland in 
September.  This event usually has over 40 countries in 
attendance and they would sincerely appreciate 
attendance by a U.S. Border Patrol representative. This 
information has been reported to the Customs Attach 
Vienna.  The Hungarian Border Guard has promised to 
provide additional details when they become available.

SOLDIERS, AND ONE LATVIAN SOLDIER WERE KILLED BY AN 
ACCIDENTAL EXPLOSION DURING A DEMINING OPERATION IN AL-

1.  PRIME MINISTER DZURINDA HAS INVITED PRESIDENT BUSH OR 
HIS REPRESENTATIVE TO ATTEND THE COMMEMORATION OF THE 60TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING IN BANSKA 
BYSTRICA, SLOVAKIA (LETTER ALREADY DELIVERED IN WASHINGTON 
BY THE SLOVAK EMBASSY).  AUGUST 29, 2004 MARKS THE 60TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING, WHEN SLOVAKS 
COMMEMORATE THEIR PROUD RESISTANCE TO NAZI AND FASCIST 
FORCES RULING THE COUNTRY DURING WORLD WAR II.  IT ALSO 
MARKS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT IN U.S.-SLOVAK RELATIONS, AS U.S. 
MILITARY FORCES AND MEMBERS OF THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC 
SERVICES SUPPORTED THE UPRISING BY AIRLIFTING SUPPLIES TO 
THE PARTISANS.  THERE ARE MANY TOUCHING STORIES OF U.S. 
PILOTS WHO WERE SHOT DOWN BY NAZI FORCES AND SAVED BY SLOVAK 
CITIZENS. 
 
2.  SEVERAL VETERANS ARE PLANNING TO RETURN TO SLOVAKIA TO 
MARK THE OCCASION, AND THE EMBASSY IS PLANNING A SERIES OF 
EVENTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN SLOVAK AND 
AMERICAN CITIZENS, INCLUDING THE TRANSLATION INTO SLOVAK OF 
A BOOK DESCRIBING U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN THE UPRISING.  EMBASSY 
ACTIVITIES WILL HELP REKINDLE FRIENDSHIPS AMONG VETERANS AND 
SLOVAK VILLAGERS, AND ENSURE THAT THE U.S. CONTRIBUTION IS 
FOREVER NOTED AT THE MUSEUM OF THE SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING. 
 
3.  I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE HIGH-LEVEL REPRESENTATION AT THIS 
EVENT.  A HIGH-LEVEL VISITOR WILL REINFORCE THE CONTINUING 
TIES AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND SLOVAKIA 
IN A NEW AGE, WHEN WE ARE NATO ALLIES AND AGAIN WORKING SIDE 
    BY SIDE TO BRING FREEDOM TO PEOPLE IN PLACES SUCH AS IRAQ 
AND AFGHANISTAN.  MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, THEN AMBASSADOR TO THE 
UNITED NATIONS, WAS THE VIP GUEST DURING THE 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION IN 1994, AND HER PARTICIPATION WAS 
GREATLY APPRECIATED (AND IS STILL RECALLED) BY THE SLOVAK 
GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS.

SUBJECT: FICO CALLS SLOVAKIA \"ISLAND OF AMERICAN INFLUENCE\" 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR WEISER FOR REASON 1.4 (B) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: ROBERT FICO, LEADER OF OPPOSITION PARTY SMER, 
RESPONDED TO THE JUNE 8 DEATHS OF THREE SLOVAK SOLDIERS IN 
IRAQ AND THE PASSAGE OF THE UNSC RESOLUTION ON IRAQ BY 
LAMBASTING THE DZURINDA GOVERNMENT\'S FOREIGN POLICY, 
PARTICULARLY ITS CLOSE TIES TO THE U.S.  FELLOW SMER MP 
ROBERT KALINAK TOLD POLOFFS THAT SMER PLANNED TO BE VERY 
    CRITICAL OF DZURINDA\'S POLICIES IN THE COMING WEEK.  HE ALSO 
SAID FICO HAD RETURNED FROM WASHINGTON WITH THE MESSAGE THAT 
SMER COULD BE CRITICAL OF U.S. POLICY AS LONG AS IT DIDN\'T 
ASK FOR THE RECALL FROM IRAQ OF SLOVAK TROOPS.  FICO\'S 
MESSAGE WAS SURELY DESIGNED IN PART TO WIN SUPPORT FOR SMER\'S 
CANDIDATES IN JUNE 13 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U)  IN A JUNE 9 PRESS CONFERENCE, SMER\'S ROBERT FICO 
ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF MAKING SLOVAKIA INTO AN \"ISLAND OF 
AMERICAN INFLUENCE\" IN CENTRAL EUROPE, EVADING INTERNATIONAL 
LAW AND PARTICIPATING IN EXPERIMENTS OF THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AS THE MILITARY INTERVENTION IN IRAQ. 
HE CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE OBJECTIVE INFORMATION 
TO THE PARLIAMENT ON WHAT SLOVAK SOLDIERS ARE DOING IN IRAQ 
AND WHAT THE SITUATION IS IN THE COUNTRY.  ACCORDING TO FICO 
IT IS NECESSARY FOR PARLIAMENT TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY. 
 
3. (U) FICO CRITICIZED PRIME MINISTER MIKULAS DZURINDA AND 
HIS SLOVAK DEMOCRATIC AND CHRISTIAN UNION (SDKU).  HE SAID HE 
CONSIDERS SDKU\'S POLICY AS PRO-AMERICAN DESPITE DECLARATIONS 
OF GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. HE EXPRESSED DOUBT 
THAT SDKU DEPUTIES ELECTED TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WOULD 
ADVOCATE EUROPEAN INTERESTS. HE PROMISED THAT SMER AND ITS 
DEPUTIES WOULD ALWAYS SUPPORT THE FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY 
OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WELL AS A CLOSER ORIENTATION TO 
GERMANY AND FRANCE. 
 
4. (U) FICO SAID SMER IS STILL ANALYZING THE NEW UNSC 
RESOLUTION ON IRAQ.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED, NOTHING WILL CHANGE 
    IN THE LIFE OF THE IRAQIS AND THE UN WILL HAVE NO INFLUENCE 
ON THE SITUATION, WITH THE SPECTER OF A CIVIL WAR HANGING 
OVER THE COUNTRY.  IN THE JUNE 9 PRESS CONFERENCE, HE 
ADMITTED THAT THE RESOLUTION COULD GIVE A MANDATE TO THE 
SLOVAK SOLDIERS, HOWEVER HE DOUBTED WHETHER THEY ARE IN IRAQ 
FOR A JUSTIFIED CAUSE.  IN A JUNE 13 TELEVISED DEBATE, FICO 
SAID THE UNSC RESOLUTION DOES NOT ENTITLE SLOVAK TROOPS TO 
STAY IN IRAQ.  VICE-CHAIRMAN OF SMER ROBERT KALINAK COMMENTED 
PUBLICLY THAT THE MISSION OF SLOVAK TROOPS HAS NO DEEPER 
SENSE. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MINE DISPOSAL SPECIALISTS, SO FAR 
THEY HAVE STAYED IN THEIR CAMP AND THROUGHOUT THEIR 
DEPLOYMENT IN IRAQ THEY HAVE UNNECESSARILY EXPOSED THEMSELVES 
TO DANGER.  KALINAK TOLD POLOFFS JUNE 10 THAT SMER WOULD NOT 
ASK FOR THE RECALL OF SLOVAK TROOPS.  NOR DID HE BELIEVE THE 
DISCUSSION IN PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT ON POLICY 
DECISIONS OF THE SLOVAK GOVERNMENT.  WHEN WE ASKED ABOUT THE 
PUBLIC IMPACT OF SUCH A DEBATE, KALINAK CLAIMED THAT 80 
PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC WAS AGAINST SENDING TROOPS TO IRAQ OR 
ANYWHERE ELSE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) FICO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS THAT 
ONCE A UNSC RESOLUTION ON IRAQ WAS PASSED, HE WOULD NO LONGER 
BE OPPOSED TO SLOVAK TROOPS THERE.  HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS DO 
NOT CALL FOR WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS, ONLY DISCUSSION OF THEIR 
MANDATE.  KALINAK EXPLAINED TO POLOFFS THAT FICO GOT THE 
MESSAGE DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO WASHINGTON: THE U.S. DID 
NOT MIND SMER BEING CRITICAL OF VARIOUS ISSUES, INCLUDING THE 
U.S. AND IRAQ, BUT FICO IS AWARE THAT HE SHOULD NOT ASK FOR 
THE RECALL OF TROOPS. 

6. (C) PM DZURINDA AND THE AMBASSADOR DISCUSSED FICO\'S 
REMARKS WHEN DZURINDA CAME TO THE EMBASSY JUNE 10 TO SIGN THE 
CONDOLENCE BOOK FOR RONALD REAGAN (SEPTEL).  DZURINDA 
LAMENTED THE STATEMENTS, PARTICULARLY THE CRITICISM THAT 
SLOVAKIA WAS AN ISLAND OF AMERICAN INFLUENCE.  DZURINDA TOLD 
THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE WAS VERY PLEASED AT THE PASSAGE OF THE 
UNSC RESOLUTION, AND CONSIDERED IT A CREDIT TO PRESIDENT 
BUSH.

SLOVAKIA AND THE UNITED STATES.  DZURINDA TOLD THE 
    AMBASSADOR, AND LATER THE PRESS, THAT REAGAN WAS THE SINGLE 
MOST IMPORTANT INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FALL OF 
COMMUNISM AND THE REINTEGRATION OF EUROPE.  HE INSCRIBED THE

PLEASED ABOUT THE UNSC RESOLUTION.  HE SAID UNANIMOUS PASSAGE 
WAS A CREDIT TO PRESIDENT BUSH.  THE AMBASSADOR THANKED 
DZURINDA FOR SLOVAKIA\'S HELP AND SUPPORT. 
 
4. (C) DZURINDA COMMENTED ON SMER LEADER ROBERT FICO\'S 
\"UNFORTUNATE STATEMENTS\" TO THE PRESS, WHICH CRITICIZED 
SLOVAKIA\'S PRO-U.S. FOREIGN POLICY (SEPTEL).  DZURINDA SAID 
IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO CALL SLOVAKIA AN ISLAND OF AMERICAN

5. (C) DZURINDA WAS VISIBLY MOVED AS HE SPOKE ABOUT RONALD 
REAGAN\'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FALL OF COMMUNISM, AND EXUDED 
POSITIVE FEELINGS ABOUT THE UNITED STATES.  AFTER DZURINDA 
GAVE CREDIT TO REAGAN FOR CENTRAL EUROPE\'S SUCCESS, THE 
AMBASSADOR TOLD HIM HE ALSO DESERVED A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT 
FOR THE REFORMS THAT CARRIED SLOVAKIA FORWARD.  IN TURN, 
    DZURINDA THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
SLOVAKIA\'S SUCCESS.

SUBJECT: COALITION WINS BIG IN EP ELECTIONS AMIDST LOW TURNOUT 
 
 
1. SUMMARY. SLOVAKIA\'S RULING COALITION WON A SURPRISING EIGHT OF 
FOURTEEN EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SEATS. SLOVAKIA HAD THE LOWEST VOTER 
TURNOUT OF LESS THAN SEVENTEEN PERCENT. WIDESPREAD SKEPTICISM 
RESULTED IN VOTER APATHY AS MOST SLOVAKIS CONSIDERED THEIR 
COUNTRY\'S INFLUENCE IN THE EP AS MINIMAL. MANY VOTERS FELT THAT 
THEY LACKED USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ELECTIONS AND THE EP. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
    2. SLOVAKIA ELECTED FIVE PARTIES TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT (EP) 
ON JUNE 13. THE RULING COALITION SURPRISINGLY WON EIGHT OF THE 
FOURTEEN SEATS.  SLOVAK DEMOCRATIC AND CHRISTIAN UNION (SDKU) 
PLACED FIRST WITH 17.1 PERCENT OF THE VOTE (3 SEATS), CHRISTIAN 
DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT (KDH) WON 16.2 PERCENT (3 SEATS) AND THE 
HUNGARIAN COALITION (SMK) 13.2 PERCENT (2 SEATS). THE JUNIOR 
COALITION PARTY, ALLIANCE OF A NEW CITIZEN (ANO) DID NOT MAKE IT 
OVER THE FIVE PERCENT THRESHOLD (4.7 PERCENT), DESPITE RUNNING A 
FLASHY CAMPAIGN. THE OPPOSITION PARTY SMER, A LONG-TIME FAVORITE, 
AND PEOPLE\'S UNION-MOVEMENT FOR A DEMOCRATIC SLOVAKIA (LU-HZDS) 
WON 17.04 AND 16.9 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, GARNERING THREE SEATS 
EACH.  NEITHER THE COMMUNIST PARTY NOR THE NATIONALIST SLOVAK 
NATIONAL PARTY WON SEATS WITH 4.65 AND 4.55 PERCENT OF THE VOTE. 
 
3. ALL EIGHT MEPS ELECTED FROM THE COALITION PARTIES WILL JOIN 
THE CENTER-RIGHT EUROPEAN PEOPLE PARTY-ED (EPP-ED) MILAN GALA, 
ZITA PLESTINSKA, PETER STASTNY (SDKU); JAN HUDACKY, MIROSLAV 
MIKOLASIK, ANNA ZABORSKA (KDH);  EDIT BAUER, ARPAD DUKA-ZOLYOMI 
(SMK).  SMER\'S MONIKA BENOVA, MILOS KOTEREC AND VLADIMIR MANKA 
WILL JOIN THE EUROPEAN SOCIALIST PARTY (PES).  PETER BACO, SERGEJ 
KOZLIK AND IRENA BELOHORSKA OF LU-HZDS WILL BE AMONG \"OTHERS\" AS 
THEIR PARTY DOES NOT HAVE ANY PARTNER IN THE INTERNATIONAL PARTY 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
4. ELECTION TURNOUT WAS EXTREMELY LOW AT 16.96 PERCENT, THE 
LOWEST IN EUROPE. VOTER APATHY, LACK OF COMPREHENSIBLE 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE EP FROM THE MEDIA AND THE POLITICAL 
PARTIES, AND A WIDESPREAD FEELING THAT FOURTEEN SLOVAKS CANNOT 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A BODY OF 732 MEPS CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOW 
TURNOUT. 
 
    COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. ONCE AGAIN, POLLING PROVED TO BE AN UNRELIABLE PREDICTOR IN 
THESE ELECTIONS.  PARTIES WITH EXISTING AND STABLE REGIONAL 
STRUCTURES AND A LOYAL VOTER CADRE, SUCH AS KDH, LU-HZDS, AND SMK 
BENEFITED FROM THE LOW TURNOUT. SMER\'S SUPPORTERS, HOWEVER, ARE 
LESS PREDICTABLE WITH LESS OF A VOTER TRACK RECORD.  PRE-ELECTION 
POLLING SUGGESTED THAT SMER WOULD GARNER ABOUT 20-25 PERCENT OF 
THE VOTES. PM DZURINDA\'S SDKU IS THE REAL WINNER. AFTER FAILING 
TO TURN-OUT IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND POLLING IN THE SINGLE 
DIGITS FOR THE PAST YEAR, SDKU VOTERS PULLED OUT A VICTORY DUE TO 
LOW VOTER PARTICIPATION.

1.  SUMMARY. SLOVAKIA\'S REAL ANNUAL GDP GREW BY 5.5 PERCENT 
DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, ITS HIGHEST EXPANSION IN SIX 
YEARS AND THE SECOND STRONGEST RATE IN THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN 
REGION. EXTERNAL DEMAND DROVE MOST OF THE GROWTH, BUT DOMESTIC 
CONSUMPTION ALSO INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER REAL WAGES AND LOWER 
INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION, RISING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT 
(FDI) RENEWED CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. IN CONTRAST, 
FISCAL TIGHTENING REDUCED GOVERNMENT SPENDING. OVERALL, THESE 
POSITIVE TRENDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE PROVIDING SLOVAKIA WITH 
A BRIGHT ECONOMIC FUTURE. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  SLOVAKIA\'S REAL ANNUAL GDP GROWTH RATE OF 5.5 PERCENT FOR THE 
FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 EASILY OUT-PACED THE MEDIAN MARKET FORECAST 
OF 4.2 PERCENT. IN THE REGION, SLOVAKIA TRAILED ONLY THE POLISH 
ECONOMY WHICH GREW AT 6.9 PERCENT. DURING 2003, THE SLOVAK GDP 
INCREASED BY 4.2 PERCENT AND BY 4.7 PERCENT IN THE LAST QUARTER. 
 
3.  GROWTH WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY EXPORTS WHICH GREW AT A 15.8 
PERCENT RATE WHILE IMPORTS INCREASED BY ONLY 12 PERCENT. AUTOS, 
SLOVAKIA\'S MAIN EXPORT ITEM, INCREASED BY A ROBUST 52.2 PERCENT 
DURING THE QUARTER. GROSS CAPITAL FORMATION, WHICH MEASURES 
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY, ALSO EXPANDED BY 4.4 PERCENT AFTER A YEAR 
LONG DECLINE. IN ADDITION, ANALYSTS EXPECT FURTHER GAINS IN 
    INVESTMENT DUE TO TECHNOLOGY IMPORTS RELATED TO FDI. 
 
4.  HIGHER REAL WAGES IN COMBINATION WITH LOWER INTEREST RATES 
STIMULATED HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION TO RISE BY 3 PERCENT AFTER 
DECLINING THROUGHOUT 2003. (NOTE: IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE DOMESTIC 
DEMAND, THE CENTRAL BANK CUT INTEREST RATES BY A TOTAL OF 325 
BASIS POINTS SINCE 2002, TO REACH THE CURRENT RATE OF 5 PERCENT). 
THE AVERAGE NOMINAL MONTHLY WAGE INCREASED 11.2 PERCENT DURING 
THE LAST YEAR TO REACH USD 441, THE HIGHEST INCREASE IN SEVEN 
YEARS. REAL WAGES ROSE BY 2.7 PERCENT IN THE QUARTER AND THIS IS 
THE FIRST INCREASE SINCE 2002. GOVERNMENT SPENDING ACTUALLY 
DECREASED BY 2.3 PERCENT FOLLOWING A DRAMATIC 10.4 PERCENT RISE 
IN THE LAST QUARTER OF 2003.

Sensitive but Unclassified - protect accordingly 
 
1. (U) Summary. Over the past two months, the GOS got some 
groundbreaking legislation through Parliament, but also 
suffered setbacks in its reform program.  Victories included 
the anti-discrimination law (reftel) and important anti- 
corruption laws.  The minority government currently controls 
only 68 of 150 seats.  It sought support from opposition and 
independent MP\'s, compromises with coalition partners, and 
the final laws were sometimes stronger than the original 
drafts.  The Ministry of Health\'s controversial reform 
package passed the first reading but still faces an uphill 
battle.  However, the Ministry of Education\'s university 
reform failed to pass after Free Forum members and other 
independents did not vote with the coalition. End Summary. 
 
Coalition Rifts Mended with Compromises 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Conflict of Interest Law, which mandates the 
public disclosure of assets for officials, now applies to 
all mayors, town councils, members of Parliament, and 
regional authorities.  The main changes between this bill 
and the one originally proposed by Justice Minister Daniel 
Lipsic is that close relatives are not required to disclose 
assets, and a quorom of three-fifths (rather than simple 
majority) is necessary for Parliament to begin corruption 
proceedings against a member. Jan Hrubala, the Director of 
the Government Office for Anti-Corruption Initiatives, told 
poloffs that the compromise kept the integrity of the law 
intact.  He said it had been necessary to gain support from 
most MPs and appease regional authorities wary of new 
regulations imposed by the national government. To help 
implement the law, the government will seek approval of 
a bill to expand the powers of local auditors. 
 
3. (U) Parliament also passed the highly politicized anti- 
discrimination law (see reftel), which coalition partners 
had debated for years. Hrubala said the government planned 
to amend 20 other laws with blanket anti-discrimination 
clauses to further protect vulnerable populations. 
 
Non-Partisan Judicial Reform Easily Approved 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Minister Lipsic\'s reorganization of the judicial 
system sailed through Parliament. The American Bar 
Association and Central Eurasian Iniative (ABA/CEELI) 
assisted with the original study that recommended merging 
district and regional courts into larger circuit courts. 
Larger courts allow increased specialization of judges in 
areas such as family or bankruptcy law and cut unnecessary 
expenditures.  The number of justices on the Supreme Court 
will be reduced.  They will only hear extraordinary appeals 
and interpret the law. 
 
Major Reforms Face Uphill Battle 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Alliance for the New Citizen (ANO) Health Minister 
Zajac`s reform package barely passed the first reading in 
Parliament, after contentious public debate.  It still faces 
strong opposition for the second and third readings.  The 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Education Minister 
Fronc\'s university reform was rejected. Both plans are 
unpopular with employees of the health and education 
sectors, even though the government ran targeted public 
awareness campaigns.  KDH MP Maria Majdova told poloffs that 
the coaltion did not have sufficient support within the 
ministries to counteract pressure from opposition parties. 
The coalition had relied on support from Free Forum and 
independent MP\'s to pass reform-oriented legislation, but 
many of them voted against Fronc\'s law, which would 
introduce tuition fees and was therefore unpopular among 
students and parents. Fronc will likely submit a modified 
bill in September.

8. (SBU) The minority government has come to rely on 
independent MPs and the Free Form party of former SDKU 
members to pass important elements of its reform program, 
often amidst claims that the MP\'s receive favors in 
exchange.  Vojtech Tkac, chairman of HZDS breakaway party 
People\'s Union (LU), resigned his position because his 
deputies frequently voted against their party\'s platform and 
with the coalition.  MP\'s across party lines vote for 
 
 
government initiatives with broad public support such as the 
Conflict of Interest and Anti-Discrimination bills. 
Unpopular reforms that have a wider impact on the public, 
such as health care and university reform, will be more 
difficult for the coalition to push through without a 
parliamentary majority.  While the government coalition 
currently seems certain to hold together until the end of 
its term, its weakened position (due to many defections from 
the ANO and SDKU parties) presents a tough challenge for 
continuing the aggressive reform program.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAID, PREL, ECON, LO 
SUBJECT:  SLOVAK EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE EFFORTS 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  THE SLOVAK MFA RECENTLY ESTABLISHED A FORMAL 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM TO MANAGE EFFORTS THAT HAD 
PREVIOUSLY BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE PROGRAM OF OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT 
ASSISTANCE (ODA) STARTED ADMINISTRATIVELY IN 2003, AND ACTUAL 
    ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WILL COMMENCE THIS YEAR.  DUE TO RELATIVELY 
MODEST FUNDING, THE ODA WILL PARTNER WITH ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS OF 
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO MINIMIZE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  IT HAS 
A WELL-DEFINED LIST OF PRIORITIES AND 13 TARGET COUNTRIES FROM 
EUROPE, AFRICA, AND ASIA IN WHICH IT WILL OPERATE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  IN ORDER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MEET ITS MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES 
AS AN OECD MEMBER AND BURGEONING PARTICIPANT IN EURO-ATLANTIC 
STRUCTURES, THE GOS ESTABLISHED ITS ODA IN 2003 WITH A BUDGET OF 
USD 4.2 MILLION.  THIS BUDGET SHOULD GROW TO APPROXIMATELY USD 
4.8 MILLION THIS YEAR IN ADDITION TO THE USD 9 TO 12 MILLION THE 
GOS ANNUALLY GIVES FOR HUMANITARIAN PURPOSES.  THE KEY DIFFERENCE 
IS THAT THE ODA CREATES A MECHANISM FOR FORMAL PROGRAMS IN 
TARGETED COUNTRIES.  IT ALSO EMPHASIZES RELATIVE SLOVAK STRENGTHS 
IN MANAGING DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSITION. 
 
3.  ZIGMUND BERTOK, DIRECTOR OF THE MFA\'S DEPARTMENT OF 
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION, DISCUSSED DETAILS OF THE ODA 
WITH ECONOFFS.  HE AMBITIOUSLY CLAIMED THAT SLOVAKIA IS ON THE 
PATH TO BECOMING ONE OF THE WORLD\'S HIGHLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. 
HE ADDED THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE GOS BEING KEENLY AWARE OF HOW 
CAREFULLY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MONITORS PARTICIPATION IN 
SUCH PROGRAMS, IT ALSO WANTED TO ALTRUISTICALLY HELP THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD GROW ACCORDING TO ITS MEANS.  WITH LIMITED 
RESOURCES, HOWEVER, THE GOS DOES NOT WANT TO SEE ITS DONATIONS 
DISPERSED SO WIDELY THAT EFFICIENCY IS SACRIFICED. 
 
4.  THEREFORE, THE ODA WILL FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON 13 COUNTRIES 
WITH TWO OR THREE OF THEM SELECTED AS \"PROGRAM\" COUNTRIES FOR 
MORE COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.  THE 13 FUTURE RECIPIENT 
COUNTRIES INCLUDE AFGHANISTAN, ALBANIA, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, 
    KAZAKHSTAN, KENYA, KYRGYZSTAN, MACEDONIA, MONGOLIA, MOZAMBIQUE, 
SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO, SUDAN, TAJIKISTAN, AND UZBEKISTAN. THE GOS 
SELECTED SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO AS THE INITIAL RECIPIENT OF 
PROGRAM ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COUNTRIES WILL BE ADDED LATER. 
ADDITIONALLY, SLOVAKIA HAS DESIGNATED IRAQ FOR IN-KIND ASSISTANCE 
SUCH AS OFFERING A \"MINISTERIAL ADVISOR\" AND PARTICIPATING IN 
TRAINING TO SHARE ITS OWN TRANSITION EXPERIENCES. 
 
5.  RECOGNIZING THAT IT WILL NOT BE A MAJOR DONOR IN QUANTITATIVE 
TERMS, THE GOS HAS ESTABLISHED CLEAR GOALS TO ENSURE THE QUALITY 
OF ITS PROGRAMS.  THE GOS PLANS TO USE ITS EXPERIENCE IN THE 
TRANSITION TO, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF, DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 
AND A MARKET ECONOMY (INCLUDING CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE, 
CREATING A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, AND REFORMS IN THE PUBLIC 
SECTOR).  THE SLOVAKS HAVE EXPERTISE IN DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE 
INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION, DEMINING WORKS, SEWAGE SYSTEMS, WATER 
PURIFICATION AND TREATMENT, WASTE MANAGEMENT, DRINKING WATER 
SYSTEMS, AND ENERGY PRODUCTION.  THEY ARE ALSO WELL VERSED IN 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, AGRICULTURE, FOOD SAFETY, 
REFORESTATION, IRRIGATION SYSTEMS, AND AGRICULTURAL AND 
GEOGRAPHIC RESEARCH.  THE GOS SEEKS TO INCREASE THE INVOLVEMENT 
OF SLOVAK EXPERTS IN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS, AND 
HOPES DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE WILL INCREASE ECONOMIC TIES WITH 
RECIPIENT COUNTRIES.  FINALLY, THE GOS WANTS TO AID COUNTRIES 
WHERE ETHNIC SLOVAKS RESIDE TO ENSURE THEIR EDUCATIONAL AND 
SOCIAL BENEFITS.  FOR EXAMPLE, SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO WAS CHOSEN 
AS THE FIRST PROGRAM COUNTRY BECAUSE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 
60,000 ETHNIC SLOVAKS LIVING IN THE REGION. 
 
6.  SLOVAKIA\'S ODA WILL ACTIVELY SEEK TO COOPERATE WITH NGOS AND 
OTHER DONORS - IN PARTICULAR THE CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL 
    DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THE UN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THEIR RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO FUNCTION MORE 
EFFICIENTLY.  THEREFORE, SLOVAKIA WILL HAVE RELATIVELY FEWER 
PEOPLE ON THE GROUND WORKING IN RECIPIENT COUNTRIES, BUT ITS 
CONTRIBUTIONS WILL STILL BE CONSIDERABLE.  COMMENT: SLOVAKIA\'S 
EFFORTS IN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE WILL COMPLEMENT ITS ALREADY 
CONSIDERABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO PEACEKEEPING FORCES THROUGHOUT THE 
WORLD.

COMPROMISE\" AND WILL \"FIND A SOLUTION.\" THE EU IS WORKING ON 
EXPORT CONTROLS AND WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO THREATEN THE 
TRANS-ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP. HE CONSIDERED THE EU EXPORT 
CONTROLS STRIGENT AND RESPONSIBLE. (NOTE: SLOVAKIA WILL 
FOLLOW THE DECISION REACHED BY THE FRENCH, GERMANS, AND

    4. (C) MISTRIK COMMENTED ON THE U.S. POSITION PRESENTED IN

REF: SECSTATE 121618 
 
1. POLOFF DELIVERED REFTEL DEMARCHE TO DRAHOSLAV STEFANIK, 
DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAW DEPARTMENT AT THE SLOVAK 
MFA. STEFANIK STATED THAT SLOVAKIA WILL SUPPORT THE COSTA 
    RICAN RESOLUTION AS IT DID LAST YEAR, BUT HAS DECIDED NOT TO 
CO-SPONSOR IN THE SIXTH COMMITTEE. DEBATE REGARDING 
SLOVAKIA\'S POSITION ON HUMAN CLONING WILL REOPEN IN

CABINET FOR APPROVAL. HOWEVER, STEFANIK STRESSED THAT ANY 
CHANGE IN THIS POSITION IN UNLIKELY CONSIDERING THE 
DIVERGENT VIEWS PRESENT IN SLOVAKIA. HE STATED THAT SLOVAKIA 
SOUGHT A COMPROMISE TO BALANCE VARIOUS VIEWS BOTH 
DOMESTICALLY AND IN THE REGION. STEFANIK SUGGESTED HAVING A

2. POLOFFS ALSO MET MONS. BERT VAN MEGEN, FIRST SECRETARY IN 
THE PAPAL NUNCIO\'S OFFICE, TO SEEK CLOSER COOPERATION IN 
ENCOURAGING THE SLOVAK GOVERNMENT TO CO-SPONSOR THE 
RESOLUTION. HE WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT SLOVAK GOVERNMENT SUPPORT 
WAS STEADFAST SINCE THE NEW DRAFT CRIMINAL CODE INCLUDES A 
COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON CLONING.  HE ADDED THAT A MEMBER OF THE 
BISHOPS\' CONFERENCE SITS ON THE SLOVAK BIO-ETHICS COMMITTEE 
AND IS ONE OF SLOVAKIA\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVES AT THE UN. 
VAN MEGEN WAS ALSO ENCOURAGED BY SLOVAKIA\'S INSISTENCE TO 
MENTION GOD IN THE EU CONSTITUTION PREAMBLE. HE CONCLUDED 
THAT SLOVAKIA IS MORE LIKELY THIS YEAR TO CO-SPONSOR THE 
RESOLUTION, NOW THAT EU ACCESSION IS COMPLETE. 
 
3. A JOINT DEMARCHE WITH COSTA RICA AND THE PAPAL NUNCIATE 
IN SEPTEMBER MIGHT BE A NEXT STEP.  ACCORDING TO THE SLOVAK 
MFA, THE LAST COSTA RICAN DEMARCHE ON THIS ISSUE WAS TWO 
MONTHS AGO.  (NOTE: COSTA RICA DOES NOT HAVE AN EMBASSY IN

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S INITIAL CALL ON PRESIDENT GASPAROVIC 
 
REF: STATE 124842 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. RONALD WEISER FOR REASONS 1.4 B, D. 
 
    1.  (C) AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY DCM, CALLED ON RECENTLY 
INAUGURATED PRESIDENT IVAN GASPAROVIC AT THE PRESIDENTIAL 
PALACE JUNE 30.  GASPAROVIC GREETED THE AMBASSADOR WARMLY, 
THANKED HIM FOR HIS HARD WORK ON IMPROVING U.S.-SLOVAK 
RELATIONS, AND EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE IN 
FREQUENT COMMUNICATION.  SPEAKING THROUGH AN INTERPRETER (HE 
SEEMED TO GRASP LESS THAN 50% OF THE ENGLISH), HE NOTED THAT 
HE HAD SPOKEN THREE TIMES WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AT ISTANBUL AND 
BEEN MRS. BUSH\'S DINNER PARTNER. 
 
2.  (C) ISTANBUL: AMB. WEISER RESPONDED THAT IT WAS 
ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE THAT THE FIRST MEETING HAD BEEN AT 
NATO, GIVEN SLOVAKIA\'S HARD WORK TO ENTER THE ALLIANCE AND 
THE SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE IT CONVEYED OF OUR DEEP AND CLOSE 
OVERALL RELATIONSHIP.  HE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR 
GASPAROVIC\'S REMARKS THERE, ESPECIALLY ON ENHANCING DIALOGUE 
WITH UKRAINE AND RUSSIA AND SUPPORTING THE IRAQ DECLARATION. 
GASPAROVIC PRAISED THE TURKISH HOSTS\' ORGANIZATION OF THE 
SUMMIT AND THE \"TOTAL CONSENSUS\" ON IRAQ, BUT CRITICIZED 
FRENCH PRESIDENT CHIRAC (AND TO A LESSER EXTENT GERMAN 
CHANCELLOR SCHROEDER) FOR PREVENTING AN \"APPROPRIATE\" TEXT ON 
AFGHANISTAN.  HE NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF MOVING AHEAD WITH 
ELECTIONS THERE, AND SAID SLOVAKIA WAS CONSIDERING SENDING 
MORE TROOPS TO AFGHANISTAN. 
 
3.  (C) EU MEMBERSHIP:  STATING \"I\'M NEITHER A EURO-SKEPTIC 
NOR A BOOSTER,\" GASPAROVIC EXPRESSED CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM ABOUT 
SLOVAKIA\'S RECENT EU ENTRY, WHILE NOTING THAT \"EUROPE CANNOT 
FUNCTION WITHOUT A STRONG TRANS-ATLANTIC LINK.\"  HE SAID HE 
WOULD TAKE A CAUTIOUS STANCE TOWARDS THE EU, \"FROM THE 
ORDINARY CITIZENS\' PERSPECTIVE\", OF THEIR ECONOMIC 
    WELL-BEING.  HE INDIRECTLY CRITICIZED THE NOTION OF A 
TWO-SPEED EUROPE, POINTING TO THE UNFORTUNATE SLOVAK-CZECH 
EXPERIENCE OF UNEQUAL DEVELOPMENT AND EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT 
BRUSSELS \"RED TAPE\". 
 
4.  (C) RELATIONS WITH GOS: TURNING TO DOMESTIC ISSUES, 
GASPAROVIC OBSERVED THAT ONGOING ECONOMIC REFORMS ARE 
AFFECTING THE SLOVAK PEOPLE AND REQUIRE BETTER COORDINATION 
SO THAT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ARE CONSIDERED AND MITIGATED.  \"I 
HOPE NOT TO FIGHT WITH THE GOS, BUT RATHER TALK WITH THEM AND 
FIND THE BEST SOLUTION FOR PEOPLE.\"  THIS PROCESS HAS ALREADY 
BEGUN IN THE FOREIGN POLICY ARENA -- HE HAS AGREED WITH PM 
DZURINDA AND PARLIAMENT SPEAKER HRUSOVSKY TO CONSULT AND 
COORDINATE \"SO WE SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE.\"  (COMMENT: PM\'S 
FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR CONFIRMED THIS ARRANGEMENT LATER IN 
THE DAY.  THIS IS WELCOME NEWS, ESPECIALLY IF HRUSOVSKY -- 
OFTEN LOOKING TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM DZURINDA -- GOES 
ALONG.)  GASPAROVIC SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT HE HOPED TO PLAY 
AN \"HONEST BROKER\" ROLE WITH THE OFTEN QUARRELSOME COALITION, 
BUT NOTED THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ENSURE EVERYONE SEES ENOUGH 
OF THEIR POSITION IN THE FINAL OUTCOME TO BE ABLE TO DECLARE 
VICTORY OR SATISFACTION.  SLOVAK POLITICAL PARTIES, HE SAID, 
NEED TO DEVELOP A GREATER SENSE OF NATIONAL GOOD OVER PARTY 
GOOD. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT:  GASPAROVIC WAS AT EASE AND RELAXED IN THIS 
FIRST MEETING, AND SEEMED GENUINELY INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING 
A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S.  HE READILY ACCEPTED AN 
INVITATION TO ATTEND THE EMBASSY\'S INDEPENDENCE DAY 
CELEBRATION.  IT IS CLEAR FROM HIS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
COMMENTS THAT HE HAS TRIED TO SET A DIFFERENT TONE IN HIS 
    RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAN HIS PREDECESSOR.  HE IS 
ASSERTING HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ATTEND CABINET 
MEETINGS, BUT IS NOT ENGAGING IN COMPETITIVE DEBRIEFINGS OF 
THE PRESS OR PUBLIC DISPUTES OVER POLICY.  WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING VERY POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM FOREIGN MINISTRY CONTACTS 
ABOUT BOTH HIS APPROACH TO ISSUES AND HIS HANDS-OFF APPROACH 
TO SENIOR APPOINTMENTS (WHICH HAD VEXED SLOVAK DIPLOMACY 
ABROAD UNDER FORMER PRESIDENT SCHUSTER).  HE HAS MADE A POINT 
OF LIMITING PERSONNEL CHANGES TO A FEW KEY ADVISORS, KEEPING 
ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE EXPERIENCED STAFF.  IT IS, OF 
COURSE, STILL EARLY DAYS -- STRAINS WITHIN THE COALITION AND 
ITS PARLIAMENTARY MINORITY AND THE STILL-UNCLEAR EXTENT OF 
HIS TIES TO OPPOSITION LEADER FICO MAY LEAD TO GREATER 
ASSERTIVENESS IN THE FUTURE.

REFTEL: STATE 152813 
 
The GOS is supportive of pressing for political change in Cuba 
and working more closely with civil society leaders. In Slovakia, 
there are NGOs and former political dissidents who frequently 
speak out about human rights violations in Cuba. The following is 
a list of organizations and individuals who have traveled to Cuba 
and/or have contacts with Cuban civil society (as requested in 
reftel): 
 
-- Laszlo Nagy, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for Human 
Rights, Minorities, and the Status of Women. He participated in a 
non-official parliamentary visit with Slovaks, Czechs, and Swedes 
this spring. He frequently participates in public discussions and 
makes statements in the press about events in Cuba. Nagy told 
poloffs in April that he believes the world ignored Cuba in 1989 
focusing instead on the fall of communism in the Soviet Union and 
the Eastern Block and he would like to do more to help. He also 
stated that the Cuban opposition is very evolved compared to the 
pre-1989 Czechoslovak political situation and there is more 
potential for their direct involvement in developing policy 
frameworks for the future. 
 
-- Kalman Petocz, Slovak Ambassador to the UN in Geneva. Petocz 
is also very active on Cuba issues. Two years ago he mobilized a 
vote in the UN that almost resulted in him begin recalled from 
his position. 
 
-- The Pontis Foundation, main contact: Lenka Surotchak. The 
Pontis Foundation operates a program called the Institute for 
Citizen Diplomacy, which brings speakers to Slovakia, supports 
dissident networks, and fundraises for the dissident community in 
Cuba. They helped to lead a petition drive for Oswald Paya to 
receive a Nobel peace award, which was spearheaded by Nagy. Paya 
also visited Slovakia last year through this program. 
 
-- People in Need, main contact: Patrick Kosicky. The Slovak 
branch of People in Need (based in the Czech Republic) operates a 
Slovak Committee for Cuban Democracy and actively fundraises for 
the families of dissidents. This organization mainly focuses on 
raising awareness within the Slovak populace of human rights 
violations in Cuba.

SUBJECT: FUTURE CHALLENGES FOR THE NEW GENERAL PROSECUTOR 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - protect accordingly 
 
1. (U) Summary. In January Parliament approved General 
Prosecutor Dobroslav Trnka\'s appointment to a five-year 
term. The Office of the General Prosecutor (GP), an entity 
completely independent from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), 
is leading several investigations with high political 
interest and faces pressure from the government to merge 
into the MOJ. Additionally, the Office of the GP will assist 
in the creation and development of a new Anti-Corruption 
Prosecutor\'s Office to become operational this fall. During 
a recent visit, the Ambassador emphasized the need for rule 
of law and due diligence on past cases. End Summary. 
 
Calls for Reform of GP\'s Office Structure 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) The General Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of 
Justice (MOJ) in Slovakia are independent organs. However, 
Justice Minister Daniel Lipsic recently stated that the GP\'s 
Office should be under the control of the MOJ. The structure 
of the Office of the GP, whose main function is to 
administratively supervise police investigations, was 
inherited from the communist regime.  The Czech Republic 
chose to fold the function into the MOJ in 1993, but 
Slovakia preserved the prior system. 
 
3. (U) In a recent meeting with the Ambassador, Trnka said 
he wished to maintain an independent office although he 
recognized several limitations to the current status quo. 
Inadequate funding means his office depends on other 
ministries for additional appropriations. There is only a 
low level of effective cooperation with the overburdened 
judiciary. Nevertheless, he believed the independence of the 
office protects it from political influence and it should be 
left intact. 
 
Creation of Special Prosecutor\'s Office 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) In March 2004 the parliament passed legislation 
creating a new Special Prosecutor\'s Office to Fight 
Corruption and a new anti-corruption court to investigate 
and try high-ranking officials and individuals involved in 
organized crime. Parliament quickly approved Trnka\'s nominee 
to the position, Dusan Kovacik, and Trnka is now in the 
process of reviewing cases to be transferred to the new 
office. Trnka lamented that the parallel structures may 
increase bureaucracy, but stated that his office will aid 
and support its creation. 
 
5. (SBU) According to Jan Hrubala, Director of the 
Government Office for Anti-Corruption Initiatives, the new 
court was confronting bureaucratic and political problems. 
The judicial council has not nominated any judges to the 
court because of a delayed security clearance for one 
applicant--Judge Pavol Polka from Zilina.  He has had an 
antagonistic relationship with the MOJ and fought prior 
reform efforts. Polka may have enough support on the 
judicial council to secure a nomination if a clearance is 
granted.  Other qualified applicants have already stated 
they would refuse to serve with Polka. 
 
Due Diligence on Past Cases 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) During the meeting with Trnka, Ambassador Weiser 
referred to several investigations involving government 
officials or allegations of high-level corruption. He 
stressed the importance of paying due diligence to past 
cases in order to enforce the rule of law. Trnka agreed with 
the Ambassador and noted that he was personally reopening 
nearly 40 cases to ensure that proper evidentiary procedure 
was followed and unbiased decisions were made. He promised 
that the General Prosecutor\'s Office would remain vigilant. 
 
Trnka Bio Information 
---------------------- 
 
7. (U) Trnka spent most of his career as a military 
prosecutor and became Chief Military Prosecutor in 1999. He 
presided over the recent investigation into the illegal 
phone tap by Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS)of a leading 
Slovak daily and Pavol Rusko, the Chairman of ANO, and the 
possible intimation of the military investigators. He 
attended Comenius Law School from 1983 to 1987 with Robert 
Fico, Chairman of Smer, and the new Special Prosecutor Dusan 
Kovacik. His first well-known case as a military prosecutor 
was the investigation of police brutality during student 
protests in November 1989. He speaks Russian and English. He 
was born on November 9, 1963 and is married with one child. 
 
Comment 
 
------- 
8. (SBU) The new Anti-Corruption Special Prosector\'s office 
is a major initiative of Justice Minister Lipsic.  Ministry 
interest in the development of this new office may also 
increase pressure for the merger of the GP\'s office into the 
Ministry.  A possible merger would support on-going reforms 
in investigative procedure at the Ministry of Interior and 
improve communication with the judiciary. Trnka\'s opposition 
to the idea could lead to conflicts with Lipsic. 
Nonetheless, Trnka appeared to be a dynamic and committed 
leader concerned with improving the internal workings of his 
office.

Slovakia Prepared to Train Iraqi Police; Awaiting Invite 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
1. (SBU) The Slovak military police have prepared a two to three 
month training plan for about twenty Iraqi policemen at the 
military academy in Liptovsky Mikulas. MOD Desk Officer for the 
United States, Jan Hradisky, said the military academy is ready 
now; they are just awaiting a request from the Iraqis. 
 
Justice for Rom after 4-year Delay 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) After four years of proceedings, Slovak courts 
convicted Michal S., of severe physical assault against Alojz 
Oracka, a 23-year-old Rom.  Michal S. was found guilty of 
attempted murder and theft, but was found innocent of committing 
a hate crime.  He was sentenced to ten years in prison and must 
undergo treatment for alcoholism.  He must also pay Oracka 
430,000 SK (USD 13,350) for lost wages and long-term disability. 
Oracka was attacked in March 2000 following a verbal conflict 
with Michal S.  The defendant attacked Oracka with a stick and 
repeatedly kicked him.  Oracka suffered severe head injuries that 
left him unable to work.  (Note: Slovak authorities do not 
release full names of defendants.) 
 
Charges of Vote Buying; People\'s Union (LU) Collapses 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Poloffs met with Vojtech Tkac on 8 July to discuss the 
disintegration of the club of independent MPs and the status of 
the People\'s Union (LU) party.  According to Tkac, LU party 
discipline was almost non-existent and at least one deputy 
admitted to receiving money from the coalition for his vote. 
Tkac added that Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, Minister of 
Economy Pavol Rusko, and Slovak Nationalist Party member and 
mayor of Zilina Jan Slota had enormous influence within LU.  Tkac 
said that he planned to join Robert Fico\'s Smer party in the 
future. 
 
4.  (SBU) In a separate meeting on 8 July Rudolf Ziak, 
unaffiliated Member of Parliament, claimed the LU ceased to exist 
when he left the party.  Ziak added that he was currently 
negotiating with President Ivan Gasparovic to represent the 
Democratic People\'s Movement (HZD) in parliament as an 
independent MP.  Ziak commented that he believes that Gasparovic 
will be a good president for Slovakia, having known him since 
their days in Vladimir Meciar\'s Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS).  He does not believe that Gasparovic will be 
beholden to Smer or easily influenced by others. 
 
Euroskepticism Among MPs 
------------------------ 
 
5.   (SBU) Poloffs met with Jozef Miklusicak of the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) and Peter Missik of the Slovak 
Democratic and Christian Union (SDKU) in early July.  Both MPs 
were very critical of the EU constitution, claiming that it gives 
too much power to bureaucrats in Brussels.  Missik, however, did 
not agree with Miklusicak on the KDH\'s call for a referendum on 
the EU constitution.  Rudolf Ziak also told poloffs that Slovakia 
must remain vigilant that small countries remain sufficiently 
represented in the EU. 
 
Politicians Debate Swedish Priest\'s Comments on Homosexuality 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
6. (U) A Swedish court decision to sentence Pentecostal Church 
pastor Aake Green to a month in prison for calling homosexuals an 
\"abnormal cancerous tumor in the body of society\" had 
repercussions in Slovakia.  Interior Minister Vladimir Palko and 
his Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) colleagues said it was a 
case where \"anti-discrimination legislation causes persecution of 
people.\" National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] Chairman 
Pavol Hrusovsky viewed the Swedish court\'s verdict as an 
unforgivable precedent violating freedom of speech. Justice 
Minister Daniel Lipsic said the decision threatens freedom of 
speech. According to Palko, Europe is starting to put people in 
jail because they are speaking their mind.  On July 13, Palko 
told Swedish Ambassador Cecilia Julin that he disapproved of the 
sentence given to the priest. 
 
7. (U) Several politicians criticized Palko and KDH.  Jozef Banas 
of SDKU, said that parliament should examine KDH\'s activities 
abroad.  The New Citizen\'s Alliance (ANO) party argued that 
Palko\'s move could impair Slovak-Swedish relations.   NGOs 
protested against KDH\'s statements and requested Palko\'s and 
Lipsic\'s resignation.  However, a group of about thirty 
conservative intellectuals declared their support for the KDH. 
 
8. (SBU) This incident will blow over soon, but illustrates how 
 
the KDH is shifting ideologically towards more conservative 
positions, reaching out to older and religiously conservative 
voters. As a result, many pro-reform and pro-democratic voters 
may be reluctant to support KDH, no matter how well its ministers 
are doing in their posts.

2.  (SBU)Poloffs met with Jozef Sevc (Phonetic: sheffts), 
the head of the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS), on 15 
July at their party headquarters.  After a 20 minute opening 
monologue, Sevc finally yielded the floor for questions.  He 
proudly admitted that the KSS is an unreconstructed 
Communist party that has limited appeal among the Slovak 
electorate.  He stated that his party attracts the elderly, 
poor, and disenfranchised.  Over 60 percent of KSS members 
are over the age of 65, but he proudly noted that in the 
past four years, the party had attracted 4,600 new members 
under the age of 45 and that the KSS had 1,000 \"comrades\" 
under the age of 25.  Sevc added that his party would focus 
on the younger generation in the next parliamentary 
elections scheduled to be held in fall 2006.  Sevc noted 
that the KSS was disappointed that it did not receive enough 
votes to be represented in the European Parliament. 
 
3.  Sevc was critical of U.S. visa policy toward Slovakia, 
questioning why so many Slovaks are turned down.  He noted 
that his daughter had traveled to the U.S. twice as a 
university student, but had been denied three times since 
graduation.  He noted that U.S. should soften its visa 
rules, but respects the current state of affairs in light of 
the threat of terrorism. 
 
4.  (SBU) Sevc was pleased that members of the U.S. Embassy 
had requested the meeting, noting that the USG rarely met 
with them.  His monologue was peppered with language used by 
the former regime, including remarks about U.S. hegemony and 
the bourgeoisie.  KSS members still address each other by 
the title of comrade.  Sevc is married to the daughter of 
Vasil Bilak, who wrote the letter to the Soviet Union asking 
for intervention in 1968.  Sevc spoke no English, so Comrade 
Blaha served as an interpreter.  Blaha is 25 years old, with 
two university degrees, his is an international secretary of 
the KSS.

Slovakia on U.S. Priorities 
--------------------------- 
 
2.   Poloff met with Richard Galbavy of the Department of 
the UN and UN Specialized Agencies on 22 July, per reftel. 
Galbavy explained that Slovakia will follow the EU position 
on all U.S. UNGA priorities except the ban on human cloning. 
Galbavy did not see any substantive differences between the 
U.S. and EU positions on the economic freedom, trafficking 
in persons, and democracy initiatives.  Slovakia is co- 
sponsoring the Costa Rica resolution to ban all forms of 
human cloning.  Galbavy stated there was no consensus among 
EU member states to reduce Middle East resolutions but that 
Slovakia is not a member of any of the committees listed. 
 
Slovak Priorities for the UNGA 
------------------------------ 
 
3.   Galbavy stressed that this was the first UNGA in which 
Slovakia will participate as an EU member state and noted EU 
priorities will closely resemble Slovak priorities. He said 
the GOS will prepare a Slovak priority paper in early 
September. 
 
4.   Slovakia\'s only expressed, non-EU based priority is to 
advance its candidacy for the region\'s non-permanent 
2006/2007 Security Council seat.  Slovakia is currently the 
only candidate within the East European Group and expects to 
win the seat.  Galbavy requested U.S. support in the Slovak 
bid.

SUBJECT: KDH MUSINGS DURING THE SUMMER LULL 
 
Classified By: DCM Scott N. Thayer for reason 1.4(b). 
 
1. (C) Summary/Introduction: Slovakia\'s traditional summer 
vacation \"cucumber season\" allows time for liesurely meetings 
and deep thoughts.  Poloffs recently met with Michal Dyttert, 
spokesperson for Pavol Hrusovsky, who is Chairman of 
Parliament and of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). 
He openly described the conflict between Interior Minister 
Vladimir Palko\'s arch-conservativism and Hrusovsky\'s more 
moderate Catholic-guided politics.  He also discussed KDH\'s 
internal problems dealing with corrupt members and the divide 
between Bratislava and the other regions.  Following are 
Dyttert\'s summer musings about Slovakia\'s political scene and 
KDH\'s future.  End summary. 
 
Governing Coalition Deals 
------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Alliance for a New Citizen (ANO) seems to have lot of 
internal problems and leader Pavol Rusko does not pay 
attention to the party because as Minister of Economy he is 
busy with the Hyundai/KIA plant and other business issues. 
There was a conflict between MPs Jozef Heriban and Eva Cerna 
with regard to EU elections.  (Note: Cerna confirms this.  MP 
Jozef Banas left ANO due to Heriban,s ambitions as well.) 
It is likely that ANO will merge with PM Mikulas Dzurinda\'s 
Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKU), most probably 
before the end of this term. Some ANO MPs may join other 
parties. 
 
3. (C) SDKU has been trying to reach out to independent MPs, 
so far successfully.   Dyttert is quite certain that the 
governing coaltiion will last until the end of its term. 
 
4. (C) The Hungarian Coalition Party (SMK) and KDH are the 
only stable parties with values in Slovakia.  SMK raises 
issues that are rather sensitive for other politicians, who 
are wary of Hungarian aspirations for autonomy or territory. 
As long as SMK is able to keep these issues under control, 
and the SMK and KDH manage not to irritate each other, 
cooperation with SMK would be possible in a future 
government.  He commented on Deputy PM for EU Integration and 
Minorities Pal Csaky, who has not been doing anything lately. 
 He does not have allies within the SMK presidium, but has 
popular backing in the regions.  However, SMK party leader 
Bela Bugar is a reasonable and popular politician. 
 
KDH and its future policy 
------------------------- 
 
5. (C) KDH also has internal tensions.  Hrusovsky,s 
leadership position is secure and he will be reelected for 
another term next year.  Dyttert does not think that Palko is 
a serious threat to Hrusovsky, because he is too radical and 
does not have enough support in the regions.  Palko often 
makes radical statements, but he does not consult them with 
the KDH board or leadership and he is like a &disconnected 
railroad car8 that slips out of control. 
 
6. (C) There is a \"Bratislava KDH Group.\"  Palko has strong 
connections with Bratislava KDH reps like Durkovsky (Lord 
Mayor of Bratislava), Ciernik (Old Town Bratislava Mayor) and 
Bielik (Mayor of Bratislava\'s Raca neighborhood).  Charges of 
fraud against Bielik (who is also party chief for the 
Bratislava region) caused KDH negative press recently.  In 
Dyttert,s view the charges bear some truth, but Bielik is 
long-time friend of older KDH officials and they expressed 
support for him.  Dyttert advised Hrusovsky to ask Bielik to 
resign until the charges against him are proved false, but 
that didn\'t happen. 
 
7. (C) Dyttert predicted that in 2010 there will be a 
generation change in KDH, but at the moment the top officials 
are still relatively young (Palko 47, Hrusovsky 51, Minarik 
47) and will stay in politics. Hrusovsky has no major health 
problems.  He is a sportsman, and although he had 
difficulties with his blood pressure, otherwise he is fine. 
He is an avid runner and goes 10-15 km distances. 
 
8. (C) Dyttert also mentioned Hrusovsky,s speech at the NATO 
Parliamentary Assembly and said that politicians were 
surprised (including SMK and other coalition members), 
because they were not used to this new terminology (good vs. 
evil, comparing war on terrorism to Cold War) in Slovakia. 
 
Inter-religious Dialogue Not a Priority 
--------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) KDH is not supportive of a dialogue with Muslims or 
their request to build a mosque.  If they come up with 15 
thousand signatures (as the law requires to register a 
church) and ask for state support, KDH will have to accept 
them; but at the moment, they do not see why Muslims should 
have their mosque if they don,t qualify under the law. 
Theoretically they could build a mosque even without being 
 
registered, but in practice, they will not get approval from 
local authorities in Bratislava (now represented by KDH 
officials), nor all the necessary building permits.  The 
Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS) is already following some 
Muslim activities (even without a central gathering place); 
this was proven by cooperation leading to the arrest in 
Britain of terrorists who had been staying in Piestany. 
 
Opposition tensions 
------------------- 
 
10. (C) The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) 
disagrees on how to proceed. One part of Meciar,s party 
wants to cooperate with SMER (Veteska, Maxon, Cagala, 
Sobona), but the other group (Urbani, Meciar, Pinkava, Rehak) 
is more interested in working with SDKU, especially because 
some of them are under criminal investigation (Pinkava, 
Rehak) for corruption.  Meciar was recently plotting a \"coup 
d\'etat\" in parliament.  He tried to get support from SMER, 
Free Forum and the Communist Party (KSS) to overthrow the 
current leadership of parliament.  However, he has not been 
able to gain backing for such action even from within his own 
ranks.  Meciar will not work with Fico, but he is cooperating 
more often with Dzurinda.  This was obvious during the past 
parliamentary session, when they consulted on some items of 
the agenda.  Party whip Veteska is often very critical of 
Meciar and they had arguments on various issues, however, 
Meciar is not ready to give up his position. 
 
11. (C) President Gasparovic will also play a role with 
regard to future developments in HZDS.  He has good contacts 
with some members from his days as HZDS vice-chair, and will 
try to plot against Meciar.  Gasparovic will also have to 
pacify his supporters from the Slovak Nationalist Party 
(SNS), who are asking for rewards such as government 
positions.  Dyttert said Cic was a bad choice for 
chief-of-staff due to his communist past. 
 
12. (C) Robert Fico\'s party Smer (\"Direction\") has internal 
problems. This became evident when publicist Fedor Flasik 
backed land owners in Zilina who refused to sell their land 
to the state at the assessed price (for the Hyundai/Kia 
plant).  Fico distanced himself from Flasik and his 
activities. It seems Flasik has been gathering money from 
various companies under the pretext that it will be used for 
Smer, but according to Dyttert, he used some funds for 
private purposes.  Fico is concerned that Flasik\'s fuzzy 
business deals could affect Smer,s reputation.  The party 
still does not have well-built regional structures, Fico is 
dominating the party, and he is quite jealous of MPs Robert 
Kalinak and Monica Benova, who have media appeal. 
Competition also exists between the western and eastern wings 
of Smer; easterners (Paska, Bucek) want to promote their 
people within party structures, but westerners seem to have 
better leverage.  If Smer doesn\'t get into the next 
government, it will disintegrate. 
 
13. (C) SNS has a chance to get into parliament in the next 
elections if the two branches unite.  Zilina Mayor and SNS 
leader Jan Slota is a very dangerous man; he is very well 
connected, including links abroad to various \"strange 
circles.\"  He is an \"emperor\" in Zilina and has absolute 
power.  He is not really interested in national politics, and 
his main goal could be to get the party into parliament to 
get cover for other activities.  Therefore, he allied with 
Ana Malikova and will give her free rein.  The other wing of 
SNS represented by Sulovsky has no power, no money, and few 
supporters. 
 
SIS a Partisan institution 
-------------------------- 
 
14. (C) Dyttert said KDH believes SIS director Pittner is not 
very objective.  SIS delivers reports to Hrusovsky in a 
random, rather than systematic, manner.  When Hrusovsky is 
critical of this method and asks about material concerning 
MPs, Pittner always says that if he gets requests, he is 
ready to supply them.  However, asking for reports when you 
don\'t know what is available is like playing, \"Go Fish.\" In 
Dyttert\'s view, Pittner serves Dzurinda\'s interests and is 
not very objective.  He thinks that the current corruption 
charges against the Agricultural Ministry (headed by SMK) 
were made public by SIS with the intent to damage SMK. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
15. (C) Dyttert represents the \"next generation\" of KDH 
leaders, as KDH is one of the few Slovak political parties to 
actively cultivate young members.  His sister Laura 
Dyttertova is the official KDH spokesperson.  Speculating on 
politics is a national past-time in Slovakia, and not 
everything Dyttert says can be taken as gospel truth.  On the 
other hand, his position at Hrusovsky\'s side in Parliament 
and in the party, combined with his frankness, offer good 
 
insight into the state of play on the political scene. 
Dyttert and his wife have a two-year old son, and a two-month 
old son.

a major player on this matter and expects to follow the

discussion to formulate a position on Non-Strategic Nuclear 
Weapons (NSNW).  He noted that Slovakia abstained last year

does not want to see this issue distract next May\'s NPT 
Review from considering other nonproliferation issues that

that Slovakia has responded positively to the Greek bilateral 
request for security assistance for the Olympics.  Throughout

Slovakia.  The unit is equipped with two portable IR analyzers, 
laboratory equipment GC-MS, spectrophotometer UV-VIS, and Auer- 
toxometer.  The unit can deploy within twelve hours to Bratislava 
airport; the Greeks would be responsible for flying the unit to 
Athens.  If the Greeks cannot provide a plane, the Slovaks have

Former Communist MP Seeks Mix of Minority Votes for New Party 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
3. (SBU) Controversial MP Herman Arvay, who left the Communist 
Party (KSS) at the end of last year, recently announced that he 
wants to represent minorities in Parliament.  Arvay told poloff 
that he is negotiating with members of the Jewish, Roma, 
immigrant, and gay communities to garner support and funding.  He 
hopes that his efforts to give minorities more political 
representation will be modeled throughout the European Union. 
 
4. (SBU) Arvay stated that cooperation with the ruling coalition 
is unlikely, since his close ties with gay activists contrast 
with the traditional ideology of the Christian Democrats (KDH) 
and conservative wings of the Slovak Democratic and Christian 
Union (SDKU) and Hungarian coalition (SMK).  SMK MP Laszlo Nagy, 
the chairman of the Human Rights Committee, expressed his 
personal opposition to Arvay\'s concept.  Arvay responded that 
coalition parties begrudge Arvay for taking away potential 
funding sources and voters. (Comment: Arvay\'s concept does not 
include any firm ideas or support for particular policies.  He 
claims he wants to elevate public consciousness about minority 
issues.  However, the groups he would like to represent do not 
have common interests or goals, so we expect little from this 
initiative.)

This is the first in a series of cables on current GOS 
activities to address Roma issues. 
 
1. Summary. Six months have passed since the February 
lootings in eastern Slovakia, as Roma protested changes to 
the welfare system. The response of the Roma community 
shocked Bratislava, and the GOS immediately initiated steps 
to soften the impact of reforms (reftel).  The GOS continues 
to improve its on-going programs and outreach efforts to the 
620 Roma settlements, most recently with renewed commitments 
to the pivotal Roma Terrain Worker program.  Terrain workers 
provide various kinds of assistance to Roma living in 
settlements, from helping fill out paperwork to relaying the 
importance of education and preventative healthcare.  At a 
recent national roundtable on the future of this program, 
the government discussed steps to assume greater 
custodianship for its continuation. End Summary. 
 
What is a Social Terrain Worker? 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. Currently, Slovakia has approximately 90 social terrain 
workers, trained and funded under various pilot programs 
managed by NGOs and the Roma Plenipotentiary\'s Office. 
Social terrain workers, modeled on a successful Czech 
program, are assigned to a number of Roma settlements 
throughout eastern Slovakia. The terrain workers, many of 
whom are themselves Roma, help socially-disadvantaged Roma 
resolve problems and promote greater communication with town 
officials. During the February lootings (reftel), no 
community where terrain workers operated reported any 
disturbances.  The pilot project is ending, and now there is 
an urgent need for the government to commit to the 
continuation of this successful project by taking on more 
administrative responsibilities. 
 
MOL Commitments 
--------------- 
 
3. Partners for Democratic Change (PDCS), the implementation 
partner for USAID\'s Roma Integration Program, recently 
organized a national roundtable to discuss the future of 
this program. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOL) 
committed to providing the salaries for 53 social terrain 
workers in 33 communities; 12 are still in the approval 
process, and another 9 to 10 will be approved in conjunction 
with a new health center program.  The MOL is currently 
signing contracts with the respective local governments, 
which will receive subsidies to employ the social workers. 
The MOL is not providing funding for social terrain 
coordinators previously managed by the Plenipotentiary\'s 
office, and it remains unclear which agency or ministry will 
be responsible for their overall management and training. 
Klara Orgovanova, the Roma Plenipotentiary, recently told 
press that there is a need for as many as 400 social terrain 
workers in Slovakia\'s Roma communities. 
 
 
Writing the Job Description 
--------------------------- 
 
4. The different stakeholders -- the terrain workers, NGOs, 
and government officials - also discussed administrative 
concerns, such as the terrain worker\'s official job 
description and the necessary educational requirements for 
employment.  Although supportive of the project, the 
Director of Family Policy Peter Guran (MOL) stated that 
terrain social work should include other socially 
disadvantaged groups, for example the physically handicapped 
or the elderly, which would require a higher level of 
specialization.  Both Orgovanova and Jana Kviecinska, the 
Director of the Government Office for Human Rights, opposed 
the requirement of a university degree on the basis that no 
current terrain worker meets this criterion.  Furthermore, 
it would be extremely difficult to attract such specialists 
to work in Roma settlements. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. The Roma Terrain Worker project is one of the most 
important and successful GOS programs currently operating in 
Slovakia.  While conveying government policy to Roma 
communities, the workers also inform the GOS about the 
concerns of the Roma.  This will help to avoid future 
upheavals, which could further divide Roma and majority 
communities as happened last February in the East. The 
dialogue at the national roundtable showed government 
 
commitment to creating mechanisms for more effectively 
resolving the problems in settlements, but it is still at 
the beginning stages.  The MOL must still reach a consensus 
on lingering bureaucratic issues, but annual salaries for 
the workers have been provided and the profession of \"social 
terrain worker\" was officially entered in the listing of 
occupations in Slovakia.

SUBJECT: HZDS AND MECIAR: CAN\'T LIVE WITHOUT HIM? 
 
 
Classified By: CDA Scott N. Thayer for reason 1.4(b). 
 
1. (C) Summary. When former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
lost the presidential election in April, internal criticism 
by other members of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS--see footnote) came out into the open.  Analysts and 
journalists began to speculate about whether party leaders 
would challenge Meciar,s top position.  In meetings with 
poloffs, HZDS MPs Sergej Kozlik and Eduard Kolesar expressed 
different opinions about the direction of the party, but they 
both affirmed its future lies with Meciar. Rumors abound that 
the minority government, particularly the SDKU party, wishes 
to cooperate more closely with HZDS leaders other than 
Meciar.  Nonetheless, HZDS representatives said emerging new 
leaders are not popular enough to replace him.  End summary. 
 
Meciar Maintains Party Support 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) After former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar lost the 
presidential election in April, he refused to shake hands 
with winner Ivan Gasparovic, the speaker of parliament during 
his last government.  That spurred negative statements from 
within HZDS about Meciar\'s behavior and ability to lead the 
party after a second unsuccessful bid at the presidency. 
Some analysts and journalists speculated that other party 
leaders would challenge Meciar,s position as chairman, but 
HZDS quickly labeled press stories about problems within the 
party as exaggerated. 
 
3. (C) Sergej Kozlik, a veteran HZDS MP and former Deputy 
Prime Minister, denied that Meciar had lost the support of 
the party hierarchy in Bratislava or in the regions.  He told 
poloffs that a change in leadership was impossible before the 
next elections simply because voters would not accept a HZDS 
ticket without Meciar as the top candidate.  Kozlik added 
that Meciar,s staunch supporters expected such antics (as 
the handshake refusal) from him.  Though a Meciar loyalist, 
Kozlik stated that Gasparovic,s win was the best outcome for 
the country, claiming Meciar,s presidency would have been 
&disruptive.8  He expressed hope that HZDS participation in 
the European Parliament would help rehabilitate Meciar,s 
reputation and the image of the party, without the need to 
replace Meciar. 
 
New Leaders in HZDS Lack Appeal 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Over the past two years, HZDS split twice over the 
direction of the party and Meciar,s leadership style.  After 
these defections, the politicians surrounding Meciar were 
less experienced and less appealing to voters.  At the last 
party congress in June 2003, party Vice-Chairman for Foreign 
Relations and current Deputy Parliamentary Speaker Viliam 
Veteska was elected leader of the party caucus.  The congress 
elected Tibor Mikus the &shadow8 prime minister.  Several 
MPs from coalition parties have told us that both are gaining 
more influence within the party and maintain good working 
relationships with coalition parties. 
 
5. (C) Even though he is one of the more visible HZDS 
politicians, Veteska ranks low in polls surveying popularity 
and credibility.  Kozlik stated that Veteska does not have 
the natural charisma to lead HZDS.  He added that Tibor 
Mikus, who openly criticized Meciar after the election, 
displays more leadership ability and has stronger potential 
to become Meciar,s rival.  As the &shadow8 prime minister, 
he reads government reports daily, while Meciar appears 
disinterested in current government and parliamentary 
activities.  This year the Speaker of the Parliament withheld 
a portion of Meciar,s annual salary due to poor attendance. 
However, Kozlik stated that at this time no politician could 
garner the needed support to successfully campaign against 
Meciar. 
 
You Can,t Live With Him, You Can,t Without Him 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6. (C) According to Olga Gyarfasova, Senior Research Fellow 
of the Institute for Public Affairs, HZDS is in a dilemma. 
The party is irrevocably linked to Meciar\'s populist appeal 
and his past scandals.  Although HZDS seems to be steering 
away from nationalistic politics, Gyarfasova said, without 
Meciar HZDS would not win the five percent of the vote needed 
to enter parliament. She commented that HZDS has never 
established a solid doctrine or platform to keep or attract 
voters without Meciar. 
 
Future of the Party Lies with Meciar 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Political analysts such as the daily SME\'s Marian 
Lesko and Christian Democratic Movement\'s (KDH) Michal 
Dyttert have told us PM Dzurinda\'s Slovak Democratic and 
Christian Union (SDKU) is pursuing closer cooperation with 
 
HZDS leaders other than Meciar, with the ultimate goal of a 
SDKU-HZDS coalition after 2006 parliamentary elections. 
However, SDKU central office director Kamil Homola insisted a 
SDKU alliance with Meciar was out-of-the-question, and he did 
not foresee Meciar ceding control of his party.  He also 
pointed out different core values, such as SDKU\'s strident 
pro-American stance versus HZDS\'s isolationist, nationalist 
tradition.  Pavol Haulik of the MVK polling agency told 
emboffs that SDKU leaders had been leaning toward Meciar in 
the second round of presidential elections, but got the clear 
message that he is still unacceptable for the majority of 
Slovak voters. 
 
8. (C) HZDS MP Eduard Kolesar, a former HZDS youth leader and 
first time MP, told poloffs that the future of party still 
lies with Meciar, but also includes closer relations with 
coalition partners.  He mentioned that in Banska Bystrica, 
the regional capital of central Slovakia, the Hungarian 
Coalition Party (SMK) withdrew from its cooperation agreement 
with Robert Fico\'s Smer (\"Direction\") party and plans to work 
with HZDS in December 2005 regional elections.  He added this 
was unimaginable five years ago.  Kolesar stated that he was 
representative of those in HZDS who believed a more cordial 
relationship with the coalition was necessary, even if HZDS 
lost a section of its electorate.  He predicted that HZDS 
would continue to lose popularity, but would win between 12 
and 15 percent of the vote in 2006 parliamentary elections. 
 
9. (C) Regarding future alliances, Kozlik said &everything 
is open8 for discussion.   He envisioned HZDS as a centrist 
party that could form a government with Robert Fico,s Smer 
or with the parties on the right. He explained that a 
coalition government with Smer would require a third party, 
without which the two leaders, Meciar and Fico, would always 
be locked in discord.  On the other hand, Kolesar opposed 
entering government with Smer, stating that its leaders do 
not play by any rules.  For example, Smer most likely 
double-crossed President Schuster by pressing for the 
referendum for new elections to be called on the same day as 
the April presidential election.  After Schuster complied, 
Smer surprisingly endorsed Gasparovic for president instead. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C)  Since the 2002 parliamentary elections, all attempts 
at cooperation between the largest opposition parties HZDS 
and Smer have failed, both because of ideological differences 
and personality conflicts between Meciar and Fico.  HZDS has 
voted with the coalition on a number of important domestic 
and foreign policy issues, including maintaining a military 
presence in Iraq.  Party leaders seem to see their chance to 
get back into government with the right-of-center parties, 
not with Smer.  They understand that having Meciar as party 
chairman and top candidate is both a liability and an asset. 
Certainly Meciar will head the HZDS ticket in 2006; as HZDS 
declines in popularity, he is their only hope to deliver 
votes in the next regional and national elections.  The 
question is whether he will then be willing to step aside so 
that others can make a deal for a government role. 
 
Footnote: The official name of Meciar\'s party is now People\'s 
Party - Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (LS-HZDS).  The 
\"LS\" was added after the now-extinct off-shoot People\'s Union 
(LU) formed.  For simplicity\'s sake we continue to use the 
acronym HZDS.

SUBJECT: GOS SEEKS REVISED BIDS IN ELECTRICITY TENDER AS 
RUSSIAN BIDDER BECOMES CONTROVERSIAL 
 
 
1.  Summary.  The GOS asked the three contenders in the 
privatization of a 66 percent share in the country\'s largest 
electricity producer, Slovenske Elektrarne (SE), to improve 
their bids.  According to unofficial sources, Italian Enel 
offered the highest bid, followed by the Czech CEZ and 
Russian RAO UES.  However, only RAO UES was willing to take 
both conventional and nuclear assets of the utility.  The 
privatization of SE is Slovakia\'s last significant sale of 
state property, and analysts believe it will have a 
significant effect on the entire power supply market in 
Eastern Europe.  Summary end. 
 
2.  On August 12, the steering committee for the 
privatization of a 66 percent stake in Slovakia\'s dominant 
power producer, SE, asked three of four interested investors 
to clarify and resubmit their bids by September 3.  The 
committee also confirmed it had excluded one bidder, but 
refused to specify which one.  According to sources, the 
three finalists are the Russian RAO UES (a joint venture of 
RosEnergoAtom and Unified Energy System in consortium with 
German Ost-Elektra), Czech CEZ and Italian Enel.  Austrian 
Verbund, which bid only for SE\'s conventional assets, is 
believed to be out of competition. 
 
3.  Analysts said the sale of SE is expected to change the 
balance of power in Eastern Europe\'s electricity market and 
the buyer could emerge as a low-price competitor for Western 
European players because SE already exports electricity to 
seven countries.  The utility operates nuclear, hydro and 
thermal power plants with a total capacity of 6,877 
megawatts, securing it an 85 percent share of the domestic 
market.  Its output could decrease by 1,320 megawatts by 
2008 following the phasing out of two of its nuclear 
reactors (which could be replaced with two newer ones). 
Sources close to the bidding said SE\'s value was estimated 
at around USD 2.4 billion, but this included approximately 
USD 1.6 billion in debt leaving a residual value of USD 800 
million, making the value of the 66 percent stake offered in 
the tender about USD 528 million. 
 
4.  According to the local newspaper Pravda, Italian Enel 
offered the highest price, with a bid of SKK 40 billion (USD 
1.2 billion).  However, it also demanded the cancellation of 
two long-term, economically disadvantageous contracts before 
the sale.  The French news agency AFP also reported that 
Entel would decrease the amount of its bid by USD 25 million 
unless it could delay the closure of the two aforementioned 
nuclear reactors until 2015, in contravention of Slovakia\'s 
treaty with the EU to close one in 2006 and the other in 
2008.  Czech CEZ is reportedly willing to pay SKK 31 billion 
(USD 931 million), but would not take on the nuclear assets. 
Russian RAO UES offered only SKK 19 billion (USD 570 
million), but did not ask any special conditions.  Pravda 
cited Slovakia\'s opposition leader Robert Fico of the SMER 
party as the source of its information. 
 
5.  The GOS\'s privatization advisor on the sale, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, said after the GOS had studied the 
bids it asked the investors to reconsider some of their 
assumptions.  It did not provide further details, unlike the 
Economy Minister Pavol Rusko, who surprisingly made 
controversial statements indicating his preference for the 
Russian bidder.  In an interview with Pravda, Rusko said 
that CEZ would only win the tender if it presents the 
highest bid.  Many observers favor CEZ due to the synergetic 
effect that an eventual merger of the two former partners, 
SE and CEZ, could generate.  As a result of Rusko\'s 
statement, SMER accused the GOS of manipulating the tender 
and demanded its termination. 
 
6.  The reputation of RAO UES has been called into question 
by the local newspaper SME, which recently revealed a 
connection between the company and the former owners of the 
now-bankrupt, Bratislava-based Devin Bank.  According to 
records in the Slovak Commercial Register, there are links 
between RAO UES and Slovakia\'s Apis company, a former co- 
owner of Devin Bank.  Devin bank, which filed for bankruptcy 
in 2001 after running into liquidity problems, was known for 
its close relations with Russia.  The bank held a lucrative 
contract from the GOS to recoup Russia\'s Soviet era debt to 
Slovakia, and the police are still investigating its 
collapse. 
 
7.  Several domestic analysts have warned the GOS of risks 
related to the selection of RAO UES.  The Slovak Foreign 
Policy Association warned that RAO UES chief Anatolij 
Tchubays, as an ally of former President Boris Yeltsin, 
could soon face the same scrutiny as the jailed owner of 
 
BRATISLAVA 00000787  002 OF 002 
 
 
Yukos.  (Note: In 2001, Yukos won the tender to buy 
Slovakia\'s oil-pipeline operator Transpetrol.  End note.) 
Others have warned that RAO, a strong state monopoly, will 
likely undergo transformation, which could significantly 
challenge its economic position.  In the past three years, 
Russian companies have purchased considerable interests in 
Slovakia\'s energy infrastructure, including an option to buy 
into its natural gas pipeline, and a controlling interest in 
Transpetrol.  Furthermore, Slovakia currently imports 
virtually all of its oil and natural gas from Russia.  The 
addition of a 66 percent share in its major electrical 
producer would give Russia even more influence in the 
important energy sector - a fact which is just beginning to 
enter the public debate over the SE privatization.

This is the second in a series of cables on current GOS 
activities to address Roma issues. 
 
1. Summary. Poor infrastructure, primarily housing, in 
settlements remains one of the worst problems confronting 
Roma in Slovakia.  The level of development in each 
settlement varies, but most communities lack sewage systems, 
adequate access to clean water, and suitable housing.  Both 
the GOS and EU designated financing for infrastructure 
projects in selected settlements in 2001, but the tendering 
process was delayed until early this year.  A settlement\'s 
success in drawing from these funds was directly related to 
its relationship with the local mayor/government and the 
settlement\'s proximity to the village.  Some settlements 
with the worst conditions may lose project funds because of 
local government delays, while other communities have shown 
improvements. End Summary. 
 
Funding for Construction Delayed 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. Housing: According to a 2004 Ministry of Construction and 
Regional Development (MOC) report, the GOS budgeted 180 
million SKK (5,538,461 USD) to build housing in Roma 
settlements.  However, only 68 million SKK (2,092,307 USD) 
has been allocated for five settlements.  The MOC blamed 
delays on problems with land ownership, project 
documentation, and construction permits.  Two municipal 
governments declined construction proposals and 13 are not 
prepared to begin construction this year. 
 
3. Infrastructure: The GOS received an extension in early 
2004 for unspent European Union Regional Development funds, 
aka PHARE, for infrastructure projects such as water, roads, 
sidewalks, and sewage.  The GOS pledged 8.4 million euro in 
co-financing in 2001, but the tendering process has been 
delayed until this year.  The EU and GOS chose thirty 
settlements, but defined nine as risky due to the legal 
status of land and living conditions.  As of April, the 
government had only contracted 19.6 percent of the total. 
In late July, the GOS announced tenders for 14 additional 
projects.  Slovakia has until November 2005 to spend the 
remaining EU money. 
 
Success and Failure: All Politics are Local 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. Poloffs recently visited Roma settlements in the Spis 
region and saw both success stories and failures.  In 
Huncovce, a successful infrastructure project is nearing 
completion. The settlement is located near a main road, 
just across the stream from the village.  It has benefited 
from the mobility of its citizens, who earn money in the 
Czech Republic and are thus able to contribute to the on- 
going investment in the settlement.  The village has 
completed the EU PHARE funded roads and sidewalks and 
purchased additional land for future social housing funded 
by GOS sources.  The mayor of Huncovce formerly owned a 
construction company and actively participated in the 
planning and execution of the projects.  Community social 
workers stated that the settlements with projects already 
underway usually enjoyed good relations with the local 
government and were at a higher level of development than 
most other Roma communities. 
 
5. Communities that the GOS has deemed \"risky\" at the 
beginning of the process exhibit behaviors that cause them 
to fall further behind. For example, in Letanovce and 
Svinia, local governments have opposed projects and 
residents protested construction fearing that improvements 
would attract large numbers of unemployed Roma.  Letanovsky 
Mlyn, considered one of the worst settlements, is located 
2.5 kilometers from Letanovce, where Roma claim residency. 
After blocking previously proposed government projects, four 
neighboring villages finally agreed to relocate the entire 
settlement away from a popular national park.  The 
government awarded a contract for the technical preparation 
of the project, but the various mayors are still arguing 
about the final location, further delaying construction 
(reftel B).  The Svinia local government cancelled 
cooperation agreements with the Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA) and Habitat for Humanity after 
disagreeing on single-family versus apartment housing.  The 
MOC suggested choosing a different community for project 
funding. 
 
Comment: Looking Forward 
------------------------ 
 
6. Even though the GOS finally made funds available for 
housing and infrastructure this year, local conditions in 
many communities obstructed real change.  Local governments\' 
decisions about housing took precedence over central 
government priorities, in part due to a lack of resources to 
support project development at the local level.  Five new 
regional Roma offices under the Roma Plenipotentiary will 
begin operation this fall, and at least one will be led by a 
housing specialist.  The offices are expected to give the 
GOS a larger role in problematic localities in order to 
ensure funds are equitably allocated.  Also, they will 
prepare communities to absorb available funds next year to 
avoid losing the remaining money.

(SBU) Per reftel, econoff delivered non-paper and discussed 
single talking point with Mr. Krizan, from the MFA\'s Department 
of European Security and Arms Control.  Krizan indicated that the 
GOS supports the additional protocol (AP) but thought that the UK 
and Austria were working on a new draft of the proposal that 
would be more amenable to the four skeptical countries.  He 
further commented that the AP was in line with the EU strategy 
and he was therefore unsure why France was still balking at the 
issue.  It is also the GOS\'s impression that Argentina may be 
more willing to reconsider its position but that Brazil was not 
likely to alter its opinion on the AP.  Krizan agreed that the 
GOS would lobby France and Russia on behalf of the UK/Austrian 
plan, but not Argentina and Brazil with whom Slovakia has little 
influence.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
Religious Communities May Get Second Restitution Possibility 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
1. (U) The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has prepared a draft 
bill to return confiscated church property.   Under its terms, 
churches and religious communities would be able to reclaim 
property that was confiscated or transferred to the state between 
May 8, 1945 and 1990.  The Jewish community could reclaim 
property confiscated as early as November 1938 (when anti-Jewish 
legislation was introduced).  The MOA draft bill essentially 
reopens a process that originally expired in 1994 and removes 
discrepancies that existed between registered religious 
communities and private persons in the past.  Private citizens 
were granted an additional period for reclaiming land in 2001, 
while religious communities were not.  The bill is under 
discussion in parliamentary committees. 
 
General Prosecutor\'s Office Defends Decision to Free Majsky 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Katarina Leiferova, the Prosecutor General\'s chief of 
staff, told poloff her office is considering legislative changes 
to the Law for the Special Prosecutor\'s Office (which deals with 
organized crime and high-level corruption).  The GP wants to 
increase cooperation between state witnesses and police 
investigators who work on the same cases. 
 
3. (SBU) Leiferova defended Prosecutor General Dobroslav Trnka`s 
controversial decision to release from pre-trial custody Jozef 
Majsky, the business tycoon charged with white collar crimes. 
She expressed confidence in Trnka\'s ability to make unpopular, 
albeit correct, legal decisions.  She stated that time will tell 
that it was the right decision, and the GP\'s office did not 
appreciate politicians\' unsupportive press statements (a 
reference to Justice Minister Daniel Lipsic\'s public criticism of 
the decision).  There was no new evidence being collected against 
Majsky and no need to prolong his detention since Majsky\'s 
presence in court was not needed.  Leiferova added that if he 
were unable to attend the trial due to illness, the case could go 
forward on the available information.  (Note: Illness is not the 
issue, flight is.  According to Slovak law, a case can be tried 
in absentia if the accused has been delivered the file, summoned, 
property interrogated, informed about his right to study the 
file, etc., and if the crime carries a maximum sentence of five 
years in prison.  Majsky\'s alleged crimes may carry a higher 
sentence.) 
 
New Social Fund Focuses on High Unemployment Areas 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (U) A new \"Social Fund\" administered by the Ministry of Labor 
and financed mainly through the European Social Fund, will assist 
unemployed and socially disadvantaged Slovaks.  The fund is now 
operating in the fifteen localities with the highest unemployment 
in the Banska Bystrica, Kosice, and Presov regions.  The Social 
Fund will make large grants up to 70,000 Euro and micro-grants 
for 25,000 Euro, totaling 15 million Euro for 2004-2006.  The 
basic structure is similar to many USAID grants, such as the four- 
year regional Roma Integration Program, in that it focuses on 
developing partnerships and projects from the bottom up. 
 
5. (SBU) The fact that the Social Fund will not be dedicated 
exclusively to Roma projects has prompted some controversy. 
Lenka Vavrekova, Director of the Fund, told emboffs that the Roma 
Plenipotentiary and other activists have sought more control over 
the decision-making and argued that all grants should be geared 
towards Roma.  The GOS countered that not only Roma suffer 
problems of unemployment and poverty.

Commander of the Polish intent to decrease its troop 
commitment and urged to provide additional resources. 
However, it is too soon to expect any new commitments from 
the Slovaks.  Any change in the deployment or increase in 
troops would require a new Parliamentary mandate, which would 
be difficult to obtain in the current political climate.

Sensitive but unclassified - handle accordingly 
 
1. (SBU) Promoting transatlantic economic ties has been a 
dominant theme at Embassy Bratislava for several years.  As 
a result of the GOS\'s sweeping economic reforms and 
improving investment climate, trade and investment between 
our two countries are up markedly.  Post has hosted large 
business conferences in each of the past three years with 
attendance of dozens of American and European companies as 
well as several USG and GOS officials.  The AmCham, Slovak 
business organizations, and the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies have all been active in promoting 
closer economic cooperation. 
 
2. (SBU) Per ref A, post would like to suggest the following 
activities to further the cause of strengthening 
transatlantic economic ties. 
 
a) Provide speakers for AmCham events.  The AmCham in 
Slovakia welcomes USG, GOS and other stakeholder speakers at 
its (well-attended) breakfast meetings to discuss 
improving/expanding transatlantic economic relations.  It 
has also been in discussions with the AmChams in Prague and 
Budapest to sponsor the trip of a high profile business 
leader to discuss these same issues. Reportedly, the three 
AmChams have the funding available to pay for this. 
 
b) Provide speakers to high school and universities. 
Emboffs have been invited to be guest speakers by two local 
business schools to discuss transatlantic business issues. 
 
c) Organize/participate in conferences.  Post is in 
discussions with Embassy Warsaw to organize a regional 
conference for the pharmaceutical industry to combat IPR 
violations and other inequities that are prevalent in 
Central Europe. 
 
d) Emboffs have been invited to be presenters at the 2005 
Bratislava Automotive Business Conference. 
 
3.(U) Outside of ref A\'s guidelines, post also foresees 
participation, or recommends USG participation in the 
following events. 
 
e) Foreign Minister Kukan plans to travel to Los Angeles in 
November for the opening of the Slovak Consulate.  He 
reportedly wants to promote business ties during his trip.

        (B) BRATISLAVA 789 
 
This is the third in a series of cables on current GOS 
activities to address Roma issues. 
 
1. Summary. In Slovakia, Roma comprise an estimated twenty- 
five percent of the population under 16 years old.  Children 
with Romany ethnicity, particularly in Eastern Slovakia, are 
more likely to be placed into \"special schools\" for the 
mentally disabled and less likely to attain secondary 
education.  The GOS recently introduced several programs to 
help combat these problems, such as employing Roma Teaching 
Assistants (RTA) and providing stipends for students. 
However, the \"Concept of Integrated Education of Roma 
Children\" approved by the GOS in May has yet to be converted 
into practical actions. End Summary. 
 
\"Special Schools\" and Roma Integration 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. The Ministry of Education (MOE) estimates that 
approximately 43 percent of Roma are children under 16 years 
old.  About 40 percent of these children attend special 
schools for the mentally disabled, compared with only 3 
percent of Slovaks or Hungarians.  Human rights observers 
state Roma are not adequately tested for disabilities, but 
are more often placed into \"special schools\" due to poor 
Slovak language comprehension or non-standard behaviors 
resulting from growing up in extreme poverty. 
 
3. The educational system is currently undergoing 
reorganization and preparation for significant changes.  In 
May, the GOS approved the \"Concept of Integrated Education 
of Roma Children.\"  This plan will transform legislation and 
operational activities with a substantial increase in 
funding.  The MOE is expected to submit a new Law on Schools 
in December replacing the current law that dates back to the 
Communist era, which will compliment this effort. Although 
local governments are closing elementary schools for 
financial reasons, but the status of \"special schools,\" 
administered by the MOE through regional offices, will not 
be affected. 
 
MOE Roma Initiatives 
--------------------- 
 
4. Roma Teaching Assistants: NGOs and international donors 
supported numerous Roma Teaching Assistants (RTAs) pilot 
programs, which the GOS later adopted.  RTAs, funded through 
the MOE or through the local unemployment office, help 
students in the classroom with communication and homework 
after school. 
 
5. Preparatory classes: Few Roma children are enrolled in 
preschool classes, and thus do not have the same level of 
preparation upon entering elementary school.  The GOS 
supports a preparatory grade designed for Roma children in 
their first year of school.  In the past school year, 121 
schools opened new preparatory grades that will accommodate 
1737 students. 
 
6. Scholarships: In the 2004/2005 school year, the 
government will begin providing scholarships to secondary 
and university students from disadvantaged families. The 
money will supplement transportation and material costs to 
attend school. Nearly 28,000 students will be eligible for a 
1000 SKK (33 USD) monthly payment. 
 
7. Holding Parents Accountable: Recently-strengthened laws 
tightened measures against parents of truant children.  If a 
child is chronically absent from school, local officials can 
garnish benefit payments or pursue criminal charges. A 
school director in Rakusy told emboffs that on occasion 
parents kept children at home so local officials would 
disburse their money instead of having to hand over benefit 
payments to the local moneylenders. 
 
8. Encouraging Secondary School: The Banska Bystrica 
regional government with assistance from the EU has recently 
begun a Gandhi school in Slovakia for Roma children, based 
on the successful model operating in Pecs, Hungary. Thirty- 
nine children from socially disadvantaged families (30 
percent are non-Roma) began studying at the boarding school. 
Organizers believe that boarding schools will produce a 
larger Roma middle class able to enter public service and 
other professions, but have high material costs attached. 
Two other locations also offer boarding school options. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. There are several pilot educational models and assistance 
programs currently operating and creating more opportunities 
for Roma children.  However, a complex program for 
integration is still only at the stage of a \"Concept.\"  The 
new Law on Schools will provide an improved legal base for 
an open and flexible educational system in Slovakia and also 
formalize the new initiatives to support Roma integration. 
As more structures are institutionalized, the communication 
and cultural barriers, that gave rise to the abuse of 
\"special schools,\" will hopefully disappear.

TAGS: MARR, PREL, PGOV, PINR, LO, NATO 
SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF MAJOR GENERAL EDWARD LA 
FOUNTAINE, DIRECTOR, J4, EUROPEAN COMMAND, STUTTGART, 
GERMANY 
 
 
1. (U) Summary and Introduction: Welcome to Slovakia!  I 
expect that you will have a productive visit on September 21 
and learn first-hand how US security assistance programs 
have enabled Slovakia to significantly contribute to greater 
regional security and enhanced NATO interoperability. I look 
forward to meeting with you. 
 
2. (SBU) In addition to seeing how U.S. assistance is 
helping the reform and modernization efforts of the Slovak 
military, your visit provides the opportunity to: 
 
--thank the government of Slovakia (GOS) for its 
contribution to OEF, OIF and ISAF, encouraging them to 
continue to contribute to the war on terrorism despite the 
recent barbaric attacks on military forces and civilian 
populations of coalition members; 
 
--encourage the GOS to stay the course on military reform 
and professionalization, especially in the area of NCO 
development. 
 
Political Dynamics 
------------------ 
 
3.  (SBU) Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda\'s government is a 
center-right coalition made up of four parties that were 
elected in the fall of 2002 to a four-year term.  Although 
this government is more ideologically coherent than its 
predecessor, also led by Dzurinda, it has faced onsiderable 
challenges since its formation.  Dzurinda recalled Minister 
of Defense Ivan Simko in September 2003 for what he 
described as insubordation.  Simko would not support the 
PM\'s decision to recall the head of the National Security 
Office (NBU), which issues NATO security clearances.  Juraj 
Liska, a member of Dzurinda\'s party and former mayor of 
Trencin, was named Defense Minister in October.  Liska is 
also committed to defense reform; he recently visited Iraq 
will travel to the U.S. September 18. 
 
4. (SBU) The September 14 visit of Deputy Secretary of State 
Richard Armitage reinforced the positive Slovak-U.S. 
relationship, emphasizing that Slovakia is a partner with 
whom the U.S. consults on world affairs.  The GOS reiterated 
its commitment to stay the course in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
and to live up to its NATO commitments. 
 
OIF/OEF/ISAF 
------------ 
 
5.  (SBU) Per capita, Slovakia is one of the most active 
international peace-keeping nations with approximately 700 
personnel deployed in 10 missions.  The GOS, with only 
minimal public backing, strongly supported the war in Iraq 
and sent a chem-bio consequence management unit to Kuwait 
under Czech command.  After the end of hostilities, the unit 
(82-strong) was replaced with an engineering unit (104 
soldiers) that is currently deployed in the Polish sector. 
 
 
State Partnership Program (SPP) 
------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Indiana is Slovakia\'s State Partner.  In FY04, 5 
events were conducted with the Indiana National Guard.  The 
impact of Indiana National Guard units mobilized in support 
of OEF and OIF significantly reduced the number of events 
Indiana was able to support during the year.  For FY-05, a 
total of 14 events have been planned, with the focus on 
peacekeeping operations and counter-terrorism small unit 
exchanges.  These would include up to a platoon size unit 
exchange between the Indiana National Guard and the Slovak 
military. 
 
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) 
-------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) The Slovak MOD\'s focus on equipment has been on 
defense reform, communications equipment, the Air 
Sovereignty Operations Center (ASOC) air surveillance 
system, simulations training systems, tactical 
communications equipment, small unit equipment, and language 
labs. Slovakia received $6.55M in FMF this fiscal year. 
There have been some delays in processing paperwork for 
acquisitions due to factors such as reorganization of the 
responsible office and lack of English language ability. 
ODC has offered additional training.  You should emphasize 
the need to process paperwork expeditiously in order to take 
 
full advantage of FMF funds. 
 
International Military and Educational Training (IMET) 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Slovakia has participated in the IMET program 
since 1993. The current focus of training has been on 
improving NATO niche capabilities. Professional military 
education courses include: military police, engineer, 
chemical, command and general staff colleges, war colleges, 
and English language training. A significant amount of these 
courses also involve NCO training.  Funding for the FY04 
IMET program is currently at $1.075M with a proposal for 
$950K in FY05. 
 
Military Reform 
--------------- 
9.  (SBU) The update of the Long Term Plan continues as the 
primary focus of the Ministry of Defense and the General 
Staff. The current effort is focused on updating the 
structure of the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff and 
the Armed Forces. The updated Long Term Plan will be the 
basis for developing the Defense Planning Guidance 2006-2011 
in October. 
 
Officer Education and Training Program 
-------------------------------------- 
10.  (SBU) The Law on the Establishment of the National 
Defense Academy (NDA) was signed by the Slovak President. 
This is a major milestone in the overall process of 
reforming Slovak Leader Development along western lines. The 
NDA\'s Center for Career Development (CCD), which has the 
responsibility for providing officer training in the various 
stages of an officer\'s career, can greatly benefit from 
leadership and technical expert courses offered by the US. 
In October, a military education team (MET) from the Defense 
International Institute for Legal Studies (DIILS) will 
provide training on several leadership areas. 
11.  (SBU) Enlisted Training Program.  Creating a 
professional force and implementing the role of the NCO in 
the Slovak Armed Forces remains a major objective of 
professional development reform. The new Basic Combat 
Training (BCT) Battalion was activated 1 July 2004 and will 
start training with the new nine weeks Basic Training 
Program of Instruction in October 2004. Thirty-one 
candidates have been selected for Drill Sergeant School to 
support the Basic Combat Training Program. The Advanced 
Individual Training (AIT) Course begins in January 2005.

SUBJECT: Slovak National Uprising (SNP): Commemorating 60 
Years of Slovak-American Partnership 
 
 
1.   August 29 was the 60th anniversary of the commencement 
of the Slovak National Uprising (SNP) - the largest (on a 
per capita basis) popular uprising against Nazi forces 
during World War II.  The U.S. Embassy in Slovakia used the 
occasion to highlight both American involvement in the 
uprising against fascism and the continuing story of 
Americans and Slovaks fighting together against tyranny. 
Activities included the visit of six veterans and numerous 
family members and academics, a book translation, a speaker 
program, and two receptions.  Embassy staff and visitors 
from the Indiana National Guard participated in over a dozen 
wreath-layings throughout the country.  The extensive press 
coverage surrounding the American presence, plus the high- 
level Slovak government involvement, further contributed to 
the success of the series of activities, which took place 
August 26 through September 1. This significant historical 
and cultural exchange was especially beneficial since the 
involvement of Americans in the 1944 Slovak National 
Uprising had received little attention during the years when 
the Communists controlled the writing of history. 
 
American SNU Veterans Return to Slovakia 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.   The six veterans and their families who returned to 
Slovakia met with the families who hid and aided them during 
the Uprising, visited their airplane crash sites and 
Prisoner of War camps, provided pictures and oral histories 
to the Slovak National Uprising Museum, gave multiple media 
interviews, and attended embassy receptions.  Major General 
Jozef Dunaj, Commander-in-Chief of the Slovak Air Force, 
presented the veterans with \"Golden Wings\" for their heroic 
efforts in aiding the Uprising.  Private fundraising paid 
for the transportation of the veterans within Slovakia and a 
commemorative flight over the partisans\' escape route sixty 
years ago.  Private fundraising will also boost the American 
content of the SNP Museum webpage. 
 
Political Involvement 
--------------------- 
 
3.   President Ivan Gasparovic, Prime Minister Mikulas 
Dzurinda, National Council Chairman Pavol Hrusovsky, and 
Czech Prime Minister Stanislav Gross addressed a standing- 
room only event on SNU Day in Banska Bystrica, the central 
Slovakian city where the SNP was headquartered.  Thirty-two 
countries\' representatives paid their solemn respects to 
those fallen at the same ceremony, including the U.S. 
Charge.  President Bush\'s Presidential Statement appealed to 
an audience the mission usually finds more difficult to 
reach.  The older group that vocally expressed disapproval 
of PM Dzurinda\'s remarks against the former communist regime 
seemed to welcome Bush\'s comments and recognize the U.S. 
involvement in the SNU. 
 
Receptions and Book Launch 
------------------------- 
 
4.   The embassy translated into Slovak a book by an 
American historian, Jim Downs, on U.S. involvement in the 
SNU.  One reception in Bratislava and one in Banska 
Bystrica, the SNU headquarters in central Slovakia, honored 
the veterans and launched Downs\' book.  Downs presented his 
research in two speeches at a two-day conference at the SNU 
Museum, which brought together mainly Czech, Slovak, and 
German historians.  200 copies of the book are being 
distributed to Slovak libraries, universities, academics, 
and political figures; Downs personally presented signed 
copies to President Gasparaovic, Prime Minister Dzurinda, 
and Parliament President Hrusovsky. 
 
Press Coverage 
-------------- 
 
5.   All major Slovak television stations, Slovak 
newspapers, the Armed Forces Network, and several foreign 
European journalists covered the events.  Press content 
related to the U.S. was all positive and focused on the U.S. 
veterans who fought in the SNU who returned to Slovakia for 
the events, a public affairs-supported historian who wrote 
about the U.S. involvement in the SNU, and the remarks of 
the Charge, who drew the parallels between Slovaks and 
Americans supporting each other both in 1944 and today. The 
embassy-sponsored receptions, as well as wreath layings and 
smaller ceremonies, also received substantial coverage.

SUBJECT:  EXCELLENT RESULTS FOR THE SLOVAK ECONOMY 
 
 
1.  Summary.  The Slovak economy rose at a real annual rate of 
5.4 percent in the second quarter of 2004, beating the market 
forecast of 5.0 percent.  Household consumption and robust 
investment led the growth, replacing external demand, which had 
been powering the economy for the previous six quarters.  The 
Slovak GDP expanded by 4.2 percent in 2003 and 5.5 percent in the 
first quarter of this year, making it the second fastest growing 
market in Central Europe, trailing only Poland.  End Summary. 
 
2.  The Slovak economy showed a strong real growth rate of 5.4 
percent (9.7 percent in nominal terms) during the second quarter 
of 2004.  Though down from the first quarter\'s rate of 5.5 
percent, the growth still exceeded the average market forecast of 
5.0 percent.  In real prices, the second quarter GDP equaled USD 
9.95 billion.  Analysts characterized the growth as well balanced 
and had \"ideally diversified\" support from both internal and 
external factors.  The driving force of the increase was, 
however, domestic consumption. 
 
3.  The second quarter\'s overall domestic demand increased by 5.8 
percent from 2003. Household consumption expanded by 2.8 percent, 
its second consecutive increase after a two-year decline caused 
by austerity measures of the GOS.  This change reflects the 
gradual growth in nominal wages that the Central Bank expects to 
expand by between 7.9 and 9.5 percent in 2004.  In addition, the 
gross fixed capital formation rose by 0.9 percent from the first 
quarter of 2004 and by 3.5 percent from 2003.  Gross investments 
(gross fixed investment plus change in stocks) increased by a 
sharp 13.8 percent, reflecting the start of large-scale 
investments such as the Peugeot auto plant. 
 
4.  Exports continued to rise, increasing by 16.4 percent from 
2003 during the second quarter.  There was little change in the 
trade balance, however, as imports accelerated by 17 percent, up 
from only 12 percent in the first quarter of 2004.  The 
significant increase is likely a result of capital purchases 
related to foreign direct investment. 
 
5.  The unexpected growth prompted the Slovak Statistics Office 
to improve its GDP growth forecast to 5.5 percent for 2004.  Many 
analysts followed suit, raising their forecasts to levels above 
5.0 percent.  The Ministry of Finance and Central Bank, however, 
maintained their projections of 4.7 and 4.4 percent growth 
respectively.

1. (C) DCM raised reftel message on Turkey\'s EU accession 
with MFA State Secretary Ivan Korcok, MFA Acting General 
Director for European Affairs Frantisek Ruzicka, and Foreign 
Policy Advisor to the Prime Minister Milan Jezovica on 
September 28 and 29.  Ruzicka said Slovakia was supportive in 
principle, although concerned that Turkey would soak up EU 
structural funds.  On the other hand, he recognized that 
accession talks would take time, which meant that the Slovak 
share of structural funds was safe for the coming EU 
financial period.  Ruzicka\'s comments meshed with his 
previous statements on the issue, when he said Slovakia 
supported Turkish EU membership but only if Turkey were held 
to the same high standards of political and economic reform 
that Slovakia had been required to meet. 
 
2. (C) Korcok was less forthcoming about Slovakia\'s position, 
saying Ruzicka\'s \"Yes, but...\" could also be \"No, but...\" 
Jezovica dismissed Ruzicka\'s concerns about the financial 
aspect of Turkish accession, saying Slovakia will support 
Turkey\'s European character.  (Comment: We note this is not 
the same thing as supporting EU membership.)  Jezovica agreed 
Central European countries know the positive effects of EU 
membership on domestic policies as a catalyst for reform and 
modernization and he predicted the Commission report would be 
positive.  He admitted Turkey was important in NATO and would 
be helpful in resolving issues in the Middle East.  But he 
stopped short of expressing full support. 
 
3. (C) Jezovica said Prime Minister Dzurinda would soon make 
a statement about his Slovak Democratic and Christian Union 
(SDKU) political party\'s support for Turkey\'s EU accession. 
This statement will likely spur debate within and among 
Slovak political parties on where Slovakia will stand in the 
run-up to the December 17 Council meeting. 
 
4. (C) Comment:  We will continue to raise the issue with 
Slovak officials and politicians, offering solid arguments 
for a positive answer on Turkey\'s EU accession.  The domestic 
debate Jezovica suggested needs to take place before the GOS 
will take a definitive stand.

SUBJECT: DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE\'S VISIT TO SLOVAKIA 
 
 
Classified By: CDA Scott N. Thayer for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Deputy Secretary Armitage visited Slovakia 
September 14.  During his meetings with Prime Minister 
Dzurinda, Foreign Minister Kukan, parliamentary leaders, and 
the media, he underscored that U.S.-Slovak relations are 
based on more than just coalition membership and reflect the 
shared values of the two countries.  Useful exchanges were 
held on Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Russia, and a 
bilateral consular working group was agreed.  End summary. 
 
Prime Minister Dzurinda 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Prime Minister Dzurinda welcomed the Deputy warmly, 
noting that U.S.-Slovak relations are \"the best in our 
history, but we should use your visit to make them even 
better.\"  In that regard, he cited two \"practical questions\": 
the fact that Slovakia is the only country in the region 
never to have been visited by a U.S. President, and public 
displeasure over visas.  The Deputy responded that visa 
policy was troublesome for everyone in the region and that he 
intended to take the matter up when he returned to 
Washington.  Mr. Dzurinda later returned to the subject, 
saying that \"some positive signal\" is needed on visas. 
 
3.  (C) The Deputy then solicited Mr. Dzurinda\'s advice on 
the situation in Ukraine.  Mr. Dzurinda expressed great 
concern--Slovakia (and the V-4) has tried to help maintain a 
western orientation, but Kuchma tells people what he thinks 
they want to hear.  Mr. Dzurinda has created a special 
working group to follow the election process, is in touch 
with Yushenko, and is supporting NGO efforts there.  Many 
more observers are needed, but the key is convincing Kuchma 
that a transition must occur.  Mr. Dzurinda recounted how, 
during his June visit to Kiev, Kuchma had painstakingly 
explained one-by-one why all bidders on the steel plant 
privatization were unsuitable, forcing him to pass it instead 
to his son-in-law.  Regrettably, Ukraine continues to look to 
Moscow. 
 
4.  (C) The Deputy expressed concern about Russian pressure 
on Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and the Caucuses.  Mr. Dzurinda 
agreed, saying that experience there is what has led him to 
decide that the planned privatization of the Slovenske 
Elektrarne power company cannot under any circumstances go to 
the Russian bidder.  Putin, he said, is very different from 
how he was even a year ago. 
 
5.  (C) With regard to anti-American feeling in Slovakia, Mr. 
Dzurinda said that he believed public opinion was changing 
slowly.  Speaking frankly, he expressed the view that public 
opinion was more negative on Bush Administration policies 
than the United States itself as a result of \"some arrogance\" 
but stressed that real leadership meant not following public 
opinion.  He noted that Slovak support for NATO membership 
had dropped to 35% during the Kosovo campaign, and then 
rebounded to over 50%. 
 
Foreign Ministry 
---------------- 
 
6.  (U) Foreign Minister Kukan hosted a working lunch for the 
Deputy and his delegation.  Slovak participants were: 
 
FM Eduard Kukan 
Ambassador to the U.S. Rastislav Kacer 
Director General for Bilateral Affairs Juraj Migas 
Director General for European Affairs Maros Sefcovic 
Director General for Security Policy Juraj Machac 
Director of the Office of the Minister Peter Lizak 
Director for West and South Europe and North America Peter 
Sopko 
U.S. Desk Officer Viera Viskupova 
 
7.  (C) Visas: The lunch expanded on the themes discussed in 
the Prime Minister\'s office in a friendly, informal manner. 
Mr. Kukan thanked Mr. Armitage for his visit and for his 
media statements at the joint press conference with PM 
Dzurinda.  Mr. Kukan reiterated the GOS request to establish 
a bilateral consular working group, to which the Deputy 
agreed and suggested the MFA announce immediately (at which 
point Ambassador Kacer leapt from his chair and rushed to 
inform the MFA spokesperson). 
 
8.  (C) Ukraine: Mr. Kukan told the Deputy that the V-4 was 
in favor of sending 1,000 election observers to Ukraine under 
the auspices of Freedom House, and the Slovak MFA was 
encouraging NGO\'s to take part.  This had the benefit of 
allowing the GOS to maintain neutrality, while providing 
 
Slovak expertise to assist a free campaign and election. 
Slovakia also favors a parallel vote count.  Mr. Kukan 
pointed out that Slovaks know and understand Ukrainians, but 
admitted he had not discussed the election with the Ukrainian 
FM.  Mr. Kukan explained the need to secure Slovakia\'s 
Eastern border evoked fear in Ukraine about a new iron 
curtain that locks the country out of Europe.  It is a 
sensitive issue to encourage economic cooperation and 
political dialogue while clamping down at the border, but the 
insight Slovakia had in dealing with Ukraine could be helpful 
in decision-making both in the EU and NATO.  Trade with 
Ukraine is only 3 percent of total trade; Slovakia would like 
to increase it, but has to be certain Ukraine will pay its 
bills. 
 
9.  (C) Russia: Mr. Kukan said that Slovakia would also like 
to increase trade with Russia, noting he had been \"summoned\" 
to Moscow in October to hear Russian opinion about how EU 
membership had resulted in economic damages to Russia. 
Slovakia is dependent upon Russian oil and some minerals, so 
could be in a vulnerable position, but so far Russia had not 
applied any pressure.  On the other hand, Slovakia was 
concerned by Putin\'s 9/13 speech, and agreed with the Deputy 
that Russia was not heading in a democratic direction.  Mr. 
Kukan and the Deputy also commiserated about Russia\'s extreme 
reactions to the idea of a political settlement with 
Chechnya.  In addition, Russia\'s lack of preparation and 
central government direction for dealing with events in 
Beslan was alarming. 
 
10. (C) Balkans: Mr. Kukan said Slovakia was well-established 
in the Balkans, was assisting Croatia on the road to EU 
membership, and was closely following Serbia and Montenegro 
and Kosovo.  He said the Serbs and Kosovars are in a Catch-22 
on \"standards before status.\"  It was an explosive situation 
that needs to be stabilized; independence is the only 
solution, but probably as an international protectorate. 
Slovakia would maintain its 150 soldiers there, because 
without an international presence, war would break out.  The 
Deputy asked if EU colleagues talked openly about 
independence for Kosovo.  Kukan replied \"final status\" was 
heard frequently in EU discussions as a codeword for 
independence. 
 
11. (C) Iraq: Slovak participants explained that military 
reform meant that 800 soldiers deployed abroad was the 
absolute limit.  The Deputy asked if public pressure would be 
lessened if NATO accepted a training mission in Iraq, and 
received a resounding YES.  Ambassador Kacer said a visit to 
Slovakia by an Iraqi official would be very helpful in 
showing the Slovak public that the deployment of Slovak 
troops is doing good.  Mr. Kukan added that he had invited 
the Iraqi FM to visit Slovakia during his upcoming trip to 
Vienna.  The Deputy suggested having him speak at parliament, 
just as the Iraqi PM would speak to the U.S. Congress, and 
said he would speak with Amb Negroponte to encourage such a 
visit. 
 
12. (C) Israel: Mr. Sefcovic, former Slovak Ambassador to 
Israel, asked about Ariel Sharon\'s strength.  The Deputy 
suggested that Sharon\'s decision to disengage from Gaza was 
intended to show the Palestinians were incapable of 
governing.  He pointed out that within the EU and even other 
Arab countries there is  a growing realization that Arafat is 
not helpful.  The Deputy asked about the visit of the head of 
Israeli Knesset the previous week.  Kukan had not met him, 
but noted his criticism of the EU position on the security 
fence. 
 
13. (C) Turkey: DAS Conley asked about Slovakia\'s position on 
EU membership for Turkey.  Mr. Kukan pointed out the EU 
report would be out in October and the decision would be 
difficult, but that Slovakia was sympathetic to Turkey\'s 
candidacy.  The Deputy noted that the Turks had been dangling 
for many years and had a right to expect that there would be 
an unconditional date to begin talks. 
 
Parliament 
---------- 
 
14. (U) The Deputy met with members of parliament from 
several parties: 
 
Pavol Hrusovsky, President of Parliament (KDH) 
Jozef Berenyi (SMK) 
Robert Fico (Smer) 
Miroslav Maxon (HZDS) 
Pavol Minarik (KDH) 
Karol Ondrias (KSS) 
 
15. (SBU) The parliamentary leaders expressed their 
commitment to maintaining a strong Slovak-American 
relationship and conveyed appreciation for U.S. support for 
NATO and EU membership.  Mr. Armitage thanked coalition 
leaders for supporting the democractic process in Iraq. 
Opposition MPs received the message that differing views on 
policies can be expected among allies and will not harm the 
fundamental nature of the bilateral relationship.  Two themes 
emerged across the political spectrum: closer ties between 
legislatures and foreign policy after EU membership. Mr. 
Hrusovsky requested that as Parliament takes on a larger role 
in foreign policy, more opportunities be made available for 
meetings and exhanges. Mr. Maxon (HZDS) hoped that members of 
Congress will travel more often to Slovakia to provide 
information on developments in Iraq. Mr. Fico (SMER), the 
most vocal critic of U.S. and GOS policy in Iraq, stated that 
his party prefers foreign policy issues to be coordinated 
more closely in Brussels. The Deputy responded that the U.S. 
works closely with both EU and NATO and was happy to have two 
new fora in which to engage Slovakia, adding that most new 
member states valued both. 
 
Media Roundtable 
---------------- 
 
16.  (U) After a \"meet and greet\" with Embassy staff, the 
Deputy met in roundtable format with five senior editors and 
foreign affairs reporters.  Topics included the Slovak troop 
deployment in Iraq; visa policy; Saudi Arabia\'s efforts in 
GWOT; Russian President Putin\'s attitude toward Chechnya and 
his 9/13 statement on consolidating power, cooperation with 
Russia in GWOT, Iraq, and Afghanistan; whether the war in 
Iraq was a \"miscalculation;\" whether Iraq can become truly 
democratic; the U.S. attitude toward \"New Europe;\" Russia\'s 
relations with the EU; China\'s growing role in Europe and the 
world; and whether the security situation in Iraq would 
affect elections there.  Complete transcripts of all media 
events are available in the Washington File. 
 
17.  (U) This message has been cleared by the Deputy 
Secretary\'s party.

1. (SBU) Summary.  Two parties from Slovakia\'s four-party 
ruling coalition have voiced strong reservations about 
setting a firm date for Turkey to begin EU accession talks. 
On September 30, Speaker of the Parliament Pavol Hrusovsky 
of the Christian-Democratic Movement (KDH) said he saw \"many 
reasons not to start accession talks with Turkey.\"  On 
October 1, Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda voiced the 
opinion of his Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKU), 
saying Turkey is not ready for EU membership.  During Deputy 
Secretary of State Richard Armitage\'s recent visit to 
 
SIPDIS 
Slovakia, GOS members were non-committal regarding Turkey\'s 
efforts to start accession talks, but were not overtly 
negative.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Dzurinda, in a press conference at SDKU headquarters, 
said the SDKU wished to begin a debate among Slovakia\'s 
political parties about future EU accession for Turkey.  He 
made four points: 
 
-- Turkey is not yet ready for EU membership. 
 
-- SDKU has serious doubts about whether Turkey has met the 
criteria for beginning negotiations and about Turkey\'s 
ability to successfully complete the process.  Completing 
the process would of course mean that Turkey would be a full- 
fledged member of the EU. 
 
-- Turkey has made advancements in recent years towards 
fulfilling the political and economic criteria required for 
entry to the EU. 
 
-- The key point; SDKU will support further talks between 
the EU and Turkey, as long as the result does not lead to an 
EU commitment to accept Turkey as a member. 
 
3. (U) Dzurinda went on to list five factors on which SDKU 
based this policy. 
 
-- The current state of economic and political affairs in 
Turkey. 
 
-- The ability of the EU to absorb more members 
(particularly financially).  SDKU gives priority to Bulgaria 
and Romania, then Croatia and other Baltic states, then 
eventually Ukraine. 
 
--The fact that Turkey is a big and important neighbor of 
the European Union, and not only SDKU but all of Slovakia 
has an eminent interest in a democratic and secular Turkey. 
 
-- A desire to support positive tendencies in Turkey in the 
past years in political, economic, and human rights areas. 
 
-- The fact that talks between the EU and Turkey have been 
going on for a long time, long before Slovakia was a member. 
The SDKU takes into account the dialogue that has already 
taken place, and wants this work to continue. 
 
Dzurinda said that as soon as the SDKU learns the results of 
the EU Commission\'s report on Turkey, it will begin a 
dialogue with all political parties to reach as wide a 
consensus as possible within Slovakia on the issue. 
 
4. (SBU) In a September 30 press conference, Hrusovsky said 
that among KDH\'s main concerns about setting a date to start 
accession talks was Turkey\'s refusal to recognize Cyprus, an 
EU member state.  He added that he could not imagine 
negotiation on EU membership could begin until this 
situation was resolved.  Hrusovky said he would like to see 
Slovakia join the initiative by \"conservative\" European 
countries that proposes a privileged partnership with the EU 
rather than full-fledged EU membership.  He reportedly also 
made reference to the fact that Turkey is a Muslim country. 
Hrusovsky closed by saying that the EU has never stood 
before a more difficult task. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: During Mr. Armitage\'s September 14 visit, 
Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan of the SDKU and other GOS 
officials gave little hint of the negative bias against 
Turkey\'s EU aspirations that have now come to light.  Within 
two weeks, the Slovak cabinet should present its official 
report on the GOS\'s position towards setting a date to start 
EU accession talks with Turkey.  Foreign Policy Advisor 
Milan Jezovica emphasized to emboffs that Dzurinda\'s 
statement was a party position, and not a government 
position.  However, the KDH\'s and SDKU\'s statements thus far 
leave little doubt what stance the GOS will take.

Classified By: Ambassador Ronald Weiser for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) In response to points raised from ref A, MFA European 
Correspondent Lubomir Rehak on October 6 told polec chief 
that the EU was strengthening the code of conduct regarding 
arms sales to make it more effective than in the past.  He 
said member states were confident that it would suffice to 
prevent inappropriate arms sales to both China and Libya.  He 
did not respond to arguments that lifting the embargoes would 
send the wrong messages to China, to Libya, and to arms 
dealers. 
 
2. (C) Polec Chief used the opportunity to ask for a comment 
on Slovak politicians\' recent statements of strong 
reservations about Turkish EU accession (ref B).  Rehak said 
that before October 1, the MFA talking point was that Turkey 
would be welcome to join the EU once it fulfilled all the 
requirements.  On the other hand, several Slovak political 
parties have strong ties with other conservative parties in 
the EU, who have been consistent in expressing strong 
opposition to Turkish membership.  Prime Minister Dzurinda 
and Foreign Minister Kukan had made their statement on Turkey 
from the SDKU party headquarters \"in their role as 
politicians, not as statesmen.\"  Rehak believed the door was 
still open for a compromise that would set a date for 
negotiations to begin with Turkey, but which would allow the 
process to stop if Turkey failed to make the expected 
progress.  In other words, if Turkey did not fulfill all the 
criteria, it would not be guaranteed EU membership.  Rehak 
said that the MFA would soon draft a \"government position,\" 
which would be sent to the cabinet for approval.  Then it 
would go to Parliament for approval, at which point 
Parliament would mandate the position which the MFA should 
take on Turkey in December.  (Comment: This would be one of 
the first test cases of the new law requiring the MFA to 
follow Parliament\'s instructions on issues before the EU. 
Although cumbersome, it would provide wide political cover 
for government leaders.  End comment.) 
 
3. (U) After the European Commission\'s report on Turkey was 
made public October 6, Prime Minister Dzurinda\'s SDKU party 
released a press statement calling the report a useful 
starting point for Decmber\'s EU summit discussions.  It 
recognized Turkey\'s progress, as well as doubts about 
fulfilling all the necessary criteria in practice.  It 
questioned the EU\'s absorbative capacity.  The press 
statement emphasized as key that beginning negotiations was 
not tantamount to a commitment to accept Turkey as a member 
and noted that the Commission\'s stance was consistent with 
that of SDKU.  SDKU confirmed that it would begin a poitical 
discussion among domestic political parties in the interest 
of reaching a wide consensus.

         workshop on the deployment of Internal Control Program 
         (ICP) software for Czech enterprise representatives. 
         The workshop sought to advance industry export control 
         awareness and to foster compliance with national export 
 
 
         control laws and regulations following Czech accession 
         to the EU.

         Bratislava.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
         Instructors Anthony Onstad and Michael Godfrey did an 
         excellent job of working around police academy 
         schedules and firewall problems, to present a balanced 
         and informative training program.  Members of the 
         Slovak Police Presidium Cyber Crimes Unit lauded the

         Department, developed and presented the training.  Mr. 
         Moravec has incorporated procedures and training tools 
         he acquired at RADACAD training in July 2004.  Mr. 
         Moravec stated, \"We want all Slovak Customs Inspectors 
         to benefit from the training we received at RADACAD.\"

the Boeing 7E7 and the brewing trade dispute, but expressed 
that Slovakia was not a major player in the industry.  He 
agreed, however, that both sides needed to negotiate in good 
faith and reach a conclusion satisfactory to all.  Rebey was 
not as familiar with recent events, but also concluded that 
a negotiated settlement would be best.  When he attends the

REF: STATE 223273 
 
Sensitive - please protect accordingly 
 
1. (U) On October 20, Poloff delivered reftel points to 
Deputy Director of the Human Rights Department Peter Bircak. 
Bircak stated that the EU will discuss the issue of human 
rights in Venezuela next week at the Human Rights and 
Democracy Committee under the European Commission.  He 
offered to relay any relevant information about potential EU 
statements after the meeting. 
 
2. (SBU) Poloff pointed out that the Venezuelan NGO, SUMATE, 
was facing criminal charges due to cooperation with the 
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which actively 
supported Slovak NGOs throughout the 1990s and in the 2002 
parliamentary election.  Bircak responded that the Human 
Rights Section of the Slovak MFA has traditionally focused 
on individual rights, i.e. discrimination and minority 
concerns, and has not played a large role in formulating EU 
human rights statements for countries outside the OSCE 
mandate.  One area in which the MFA acknowledges it should 
be more involved is election-related concerns worldwide. 
There is increasing domestic interest in exporting Slovak 
expertise in election observation and support for 
democratization. 
3. (SBU) Comment:  Slovakia does not have an embassy in 
Venezuela and does not have direct interests there.  Unlike 
human rights issues in Cuba -- where Slovakia has historical 
ties, an embassy, and an active policy to promote human 
rights (septel) -- Slovakia will follow the EU lead on what 
to do about Venezuela.

SUBJECT: SLOVAKS FORMULATING POSITION ON EXPORT CONTROLS TO 
LIBYA 
 
REF: STATE 221188 
 
Classified By: CDA Scott Thayer for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Per reftel, poloffs met October 15 with Karol Mistrik, 
Director of the Department of OSCE, Disarmament, and Council 
of Europe, MFA; Rastislav Krizan, export control expert in 
the same department; and Lubomir Rehak, European 
Correspondent, MFA.  Mistrik presented the EU argument that a 
strengthened Code of Conduct would prevent inappropriate 
exports to Libya. He noted Slovakia did not want to exclude 
itself from opportunities that other EU states would soon 
enjoy. 
 
2. (C) Mistrik said lifting the embargo was a positive signal 
to reward Libya for \"its recent strides.\"  He said lifting 
the embargo does not preclude effective export controls.  The 
EU member states, including Slovakia, would not export 
high-tech or sensitive technologies to Libya.  He described 
lethal and non-lethal export policy as the matter of internal 
discussion at the MFA.  He said Slovakia cannot stand alone 
in the EU and does not see why they should not export the 
same materials other EU states do.  Rehak added the Council 
of Ministers is waiting on a positive sign from Libya on the 
Bulgarian medics and human rights situation before making 
further policy decisions. 
 
3. (C) Mistrik defended the EU Code of Conduct, describing 
export controls as a matter of national policy for 
responsible governments.  He described the \"political 
commitment\" as sometimes stronger than legal ones due to 
effective peer pressure.  He said Slovaks are still 
discussing what, if anything, they might approve in the 
future for export to Libya.  Poloffs informed MFA 
interlocutors that should the GOS export \"lethal\" materiel 
while U.S. sanctions were in place, they jeopardized Slovak 
FMF and IMET assistance. DCM made the same points October 18 
with Lubomir Cano, head of MFA\'s Security Policy department, 
and Vladimir Jakabcin, MOD DirGen for International Policy. 
Mistrik was visibly concerned at the possible impact exports 
of certain \"lethal\" materiel might have on FMF, IMET, and 
future involvement in the Excess Defense Articles program. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT: Arms exports were in the past a large 
component of the Slovak economy.  Czechoslovak arms 
production peaked in 1988 when 140,000 people were employed 
directly or indirectly by the industry.  Seventy percent of 
production was exported (fifty percent to Warsaw pact 
countries and twenty percent to developing countries) and 
thirty percent was for domestic use.   Sixty percent of the 
100 Czechoslovak arms enterprises were located in Slovakia. 
The industry collapsed during the 1990s and the GOS would 
like to revive arms production.  DefMin Juraj Liska proposed 
in September to UnderSecDef for Acquisition Technology and 
Logistics working with U.S. firms to produce arms required by 
NATO.  There are still stockpiles that the Slovaks would like 
to market.  END COMMENT.

1. (SBU) Summary. On October 20, Poloffs met with some 
members of the Slovak delegation to the recent OSCE 
conference in Warsaw to discuss their views about OSCE 
concerns regarding human rights. Director General of Consular 
and Legal Affairs Ivan Grexa said he had been prepared for 
more criticism both in the general discussion and the 
bilateral meeting with the U.S. delegation. He noted that our 
encouragement for reform efforts and the steps to assist the 
Roma community were signs of Slovakia\'s maturing democracy. 
The MFA officials discussed basic observations of the 
conference, criticism of Slovakia\'s religious registration 
requirement, and the treatment of Slovakia\'s small Muslim 
minority. End Summary. 
 
DG Prepared for More Criticism at HDIM 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Director General of Consular and Legal Affairs 
of the Slovak MFA Ivan Grexa met with poloffs on October 20 
to discuss the recent OSCE Human Dimension Implementation 
Meeting (HDIM) in Warsaw.  As head of the delegation, he 
expressed his appreciation for the information provided by 
the U.S. Special Envoy Matthew Waxman about the abuse in the 
Abu-Grarib prison and for the encouraging comments made by 
the U.S. delegation in the bilateral meeting. 
 
3. (SBU) Grexa stated he had been prepared for more criticism 
of Slovakia in both the general discussion and in the 
bilateral meeting about the allegations of coerced 
sterilization of Roma women that surfaced last year and the 
grocery store lootings in February after the implementation 
of welfare reform.  He stressed that recent reforms have 
placed pressures on the Roma population, but were not made 
without regard to their situation.  The government has taken 
concrete measures to correct certain problems and include 
protections, including new legal norms governing 
sterilization procedures.  He stated the MFA communicated to 
Justice Minster Lipsic the concerns of the U.S. delegation 
about defamation articles still present in the draft Penal 
Code. 
 
Religious Registration Requirement 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) To register as a new religion in Slovakia, a group 
must submit a list of 20,000 permanent residents who adhere 
to that religion.  Leaders of a number of minority religions, 
such as Muslims, smaller Protestant churches, the Hare 
Krishna community, and the Church of Scientology, complained 
the large numerical requirement effectively barred them from 
obtaining registered status.  At last year\'s HDIM, the Slovak 
delegation promised to propose discussion on this issue at 
the government level.  The MFA initiated a ministerial 
discussion over the summer, but the decision was to maintain 
the status quo. 
 
5. (C) Grexa surmised that there would not be any change in 
this law during this election period.  He suggested bringing 
pressure on key ministries, such as Justice or Culture. He 
insinuated that certain ministers content with the dominant 
position of the Catholic church were blocking further action. 
 Grexa stated that he and Foreign Minister Kukan  were not 
satisfied with this result, but he believed that religious 
freedoms were currently not violated by this law. 
 
6. (C) The MFA would like to explore alternatives to the 
current status quo, such as the tiering system introduced by 
the Czechs.  However, Grexa stated that the message received 
from Washington was that no quotas for official recognition 
of a religion were acceptable.  Another alternative would be 
to provide exceptions for certain religions, particularly 
Islam.  Since the state offers subsidies to official 
religions to support office expenses and clergy, more 
research is needed regarding possible impacts and related 
expenses. 
 
The Muslim Minority 
------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Deputy Director of the Human Rights Section Bircak 
was aware of complaints the Muslim community brought forward 
about being denied permission to build a mosque in 
Bratislava.  He stated that bureaucratic problems were to 
blame, but he also questioned the motivations of local 
government officials.  Grexa mentioned that Muslim 
businessman from the Balkans were becoming more established 
and expected their numbers to grow in the future.  He agreed 
with Grexa that problems innate to the registration 
requirement will gain prominence in the coming years. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) On the registration requirement for religious 
recognition, it is clear that ministers of the coalition 
party Christian Democractic Movement (KDH) have been 
successful in maintaining the status quo.  KDH also controls 
the Bratislava mayor\'s office; hence discussions about a 
mosque in Bratislava often centers around deeper objections 
on principle from devout Catholic politicians.  It is an 
issue we will continue to address, both directly and using 
other cultural and education tools.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
Slovak NGOs Coach Iraqis on Building Civil Society 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
1. (U) The Pontis Foundation will bring an Iraqi delegation 
consisting of politicians, NGO workers, and diplomats to 
Slovakia for a brief introduction to the Slovak government 
and press.  The Bratislava-based International Republican 
Institute (IRI) and the Pontis Foundation presented their 
experiences and reflections September 24 after an eight-day 
trip to Baghdad.  Pontis employees described their trip to 
Baghdad to meet project implementers and to consult new 
political parties and civil society organizations.  They 
discussed security challenges but focused on the 
psychological hurdles to creating a free society similar to 
those Slovakia had to overcome.  Most interlocutors knew 
Slovakia\'s recent history and said the Slovaks understood 
their situation and provided relevant recommendations.  The 
Iraqis were concerned that donor money was too focused on 
elections, giving rise to many new NGOs focused solely on 
upcoming elections without any long-term focus. 
 
Parliament Approves Further Reform Agenda Laws 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (U) Parliament approved four laws providing for 
substantial fiscal decentralization.  The legislation allows 
municipalities and regional self-governments to retain 
approximately 15 percent of the centrally collected income 
tax and collect some local taxes. 
 
3. (U) Parliament approved six laws introducing market 
principles into the Slovak health care system.  Health 
reform focuses on privatization of health care service 
providers and health insurance companies, patients\' 
participation in their own treatment, and preventative 
medicine (septel). 
 
4. (SBU) Parliament abolished the \"tripartite law\" requiring 
the government to consult with employers\' associations and 
labor unions on issues affecting the workforce.  Now the 
\"tripartite\" system will function only as an advisory body 
for the government.  The de facto result was to downgrade 
the formal status and influence of the Confederation of 
Labor Unions (KOZ), which increasingly focused on political 
activism rather than labor issues and had cooperated closely 
with the political party SMER. 
 
5. (U) Parliament opened another twelve-month window for 
churches to seek restitution of land and real estate.  Many 
churches could not process restitution claims in the twelve- 
month period previously allowed in 1993. 
 
6. (SBU) President Gasparovic vetoed all twelve reform laws. 
Three coalition MPs (Eva Cerna, ANO; Jozef Banas, SDKU; and 
Gyorgy Juhasz, SMK) told poloffs October 19 that 
Gasparovic\'s veto was a populist move that parliament would 
certainly overturn.  Parliament overturned eleven vetoes, 
excluding the law on property restitution.  The excluded law 
had a \"technical error\" where a critical paragraph was 
excluded when parliament sent the law to the president. 
Previous presidents would informally send legislation back 
for correction; Gasparovic\'s veto delays the legislation for 
six months until it can be re-submitted as a new bill. 
Pursuing the controversial legislation this session would be 
highly questionable constitutionally and therefore would 
almost certainly fail. 
 
Polish-Czech-Slovak Brigade Will Disband 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Vladimir Jakabcin, Director General, Defense Policy 
and International Relations, MOD voiced regret to emboffs 
October 27 that the Slovak MOD has decided to disband the 
multinational brigade.  The brigade began as a Vishegrad-4 
initiative intended to promote multinational military 
cooperation shortly after Poland, Hungary, and the Czech 
Republic joined NATO.  Hungary opted out.  Jakabcin, former 
Slovak DCM to Poland who worked the creation of this 
brigade, noted Polish dissatisfaction with the Slovak 
decision.  He highlighted the value of the multinational 
command leadership and management experience.  The unit is 
too small and static to meet NATO standards.  Jakabcin said 
reforming the brigade to form an EU Battlegroup or NRF unit 
would be too expensive. 
 
Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) Merges with Smer 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
8. (SBU) Tibor Kruzlik, former adviser to SDL Chairman Jozef 
Migas, told political specialist SDL\'s merger with Smer is a 
done deal.  SDL could not find a new, charismatic leader to 
 
drive the party on a national scale.  SDL\'s large number of 
mayors, municipal deputies, and regional politicians as well 
as physical party infrastructure will fold into Smer.  SDL 
may receive seats in parliament in return.  Smer may gain 
SDL\'s membership in international party organizations such 
as the Socialist International.  The merger may stabilize 
Smer\'s support from the political left.  On the other hand, 
it may open the party to further rifts between SMER\'s 
centrist, business-interested sect and SDL\'s leftists. 
 
9. (SBU) Smer will likely open its ranks to Social Democrats 
(SDSS) members, although the parties will not merge.  SDSS 
party infighting prevented it from effectively negotiating 
for a future on the political scene within SMER.

SUBJECT: SLOVAK TROOPS IN IRAQ AFTER POLISH WITHDRAWAL? 
 
REF: BRATISLAVA 836 
 
Classified By: DCM Scott Thayer for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. Robert Kalinak, Chairman of the Parliamentary 
Security and Defense Committee and member of the opposition 
party SMER, recently questioned the Slovak troop mandate in 
Iraq on a political TV talk show.  While remaining supportive 
of coalition objectives in Iraq, he raised three issues: 
 
-- An allegation that Slovak deminers have been unable to 
leave their camp to work for five months, because the 
security situation is too tense; 
 
-- Slovak troops may be more effective in Afghanistan; and 
 
-- Poland is recosidering its troop commitments and maybe 
Slovakia should too. 
 
Defense Minister Juraj Liska on the same TV talk show 
conceded Kalinak\'s points may deserve long-term attention. 
We are best served considering a possible government and 
public relations strategy to maintain Slovak commitments in 
Iraq if Poland withdraws or reduces forces. END SUMMARY. 
 
Kalinak: \"Deminers Cannot Work in Iraq; Shift to 
Afghanistan?\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
2. (U) Kalinak argued that parliament should reconsider the 
troop mandate at the time of the next rotation in January, 
since \"all they (the Slovak deminers) do is stay in their 
camp.\"  He pointed out that Slovak deminers have not been 
able to work since the last troop rotation in June due to 
security risks.  He said this policy needlessly risks 
soldiers\' lives and costs Slovakia money.  Kalinak said he 
supports the U.S. and its Iraq policy but added Slovakia 
\"would be much more of a help in Afghanistan than we are in 
Iraq.\"  He also suggested Slovakia could train Iraqi police 
in Slovakia to support the coalition effort.  (NOTE: The 104 
Slovak troops in Iraq are on an open-ended mandate, ergo 
Kalinak\'s focus on rotation dates rather than mandate 
renewal.) 
 
3. (U) Liska responded in the same interview by expressing 
the need for the coalition to succeed in Iraq.  He mentioned 
the positive international marks Slovak deminers have earned 
but conceded Kalinak\'s point saying, \"I think that if our 
troops are kept from doing their job for a long time, it 
might make sense to discuss in parliament whether their 
presence in Iraq is still effective or whether their mandate 
should be changed, come the next rotation.\" 
 
Slovaks ARE working in Iraq 
---------------------------- 
4. (C) Vladimir Jakabcin, Director General for Defense Policy 
and International Relations at the MOD told emboffs October 
26 Liska knew the deminers were working, but Kalinak\'s 
\"energetic and impatient\" style prevented Liska from speaking 
up on television.  Jakabcin said each of the ministries and 
parliament must communicate more effectively amongst 
themselves.  Jakabcin confirmed information that Joint 
Operations Center Chief Col. Ondrej Novosad gave in an 
October 21 press conference: the contingent this rotation has 
demined 25 kilometers, verified 275,000 square meters of 
munitions destruction, and completed eight engineering 
surveys.  The contingent is expecting an increased work load 
when it moves to Al Kut. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) Any Polish moves towards disengagement will raise 
further questions from Slovak politicians about possible 
Slovak disengagement.  Not only Kalinak, but also other 
members of the Defense Committee including Vice-Chair Roman 
Vavrik (SDKU) have linked any Polish decrease in forces to a 
need for Slovakia to reconsider the work Slovak troops are 
performing in Iraq.  Slovakia would need a guarantee that its 
contingent\'s security would be covered and that its mission 
was truly needed.   The German Marshall Fund\'s Transatlantic 
Trends report indicates 71 percent of Slovaks disapprove of 
the presence of Slovak troops in Iraq (Ref C). 
 
6. (C) The GOS has stood resolute in its defense of the 
Slovak humanitarian mission.  The mandate of the Slovak 
contingent does not allow for combat operations.  From a 
 
government relations and public relations perspective, we are 
well-served by considering the implications of a possible 
Polish draw down or withdrawal now.

REF: (A) BRATISLAVA 00909 
 
     (B) BRATISLAVA 00923 
 
1. (U) Summary.  The vast majority of Slovak political 
parties have expressed support for beginning EU-accession 
talks with Turkey.  However, they caution that beginning 
talks is not a guarantee of support for joining the EU; 
Turkey must fully meet all the political and economic 
requirements for membership.  One government coalition 
party, the Christian Democratic Party (KDH), has vocally 
opposed opening EU accession talks with Turkey.  A recent 
constitutional amendment gives parliament the final 
authority to make decisions on Slovakia\'s positions within 
the EU.  Deciding how Slovakia will vote in December on 
Turkish EU-accession talks is the first test case of the new 
law.  End Summary. 
 
Dzurinda Gets Support from Opposition 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) True to his word, after promising in a 10/1 press 
conference at his Slovak Democratic and Christian Union 
(SDKU) party\'s headquarters to begin a dialogue among 
political parties on Turkish EU accession (ref A), Prime 
Minister Dzurinda did just that.  He secured support for 
setting a firm date to begin talks with Turkey from the co- 
governing Hungarian Coalition Party (SMK) and Alliance of 
the New Citizen (ANO), and from the two major opposition 
parties, Smer and the Movement for Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS).  All were careful to say that beginning talks was 
not a guarantee that Turkey would be admitted to the EU; it 
must first fulfill all the conditions for membership.  HZDS 
Chairman Vladimir Meciar stated, \"If EU entry talks begin, 
they will consist of several years of political hang-ups, 
but it is better that they start than not at all.\"  Smer\'s 
chairman Robert Fico indicated his party\'s support for 
beginning negotiations did not automatically presume future 
support of Turkey\'s membership in the union. 
 
3. (U) Smaller parties in Parliament, such as the People\'s 
Union (LU) and the Free Forum (FF), also agreed on the need 
to start entry talks with Turkey.  President Gasparovic 
commented that Turkey should be admitted to the European 
Union after its long wait. The president said, \"Telling 
Turkey \'no\' would not be acceptable from a political or 
civil view.\" 
 
KDH Chooses God Over Politics 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Of the four governing parties, only the KDH remains 
resolutely opposed to opening talks.  KDH Chairman Pavol 
Hrusovsky recently stated on national TV that his party 
objects to talks because of unresolved issues, such as 
Cyprus, human rights violations, and maintaining standard 
democratic practices throughout the EU.  As a strong 
Catholic-based party, KDH has also maintained that the EU 
should remain solely a Christian community.  The Slovak 
Conference of Catholic Bishops said Turkey has not met the 
criteria for entering the EU and \"lacks the basic roots of 
Europe, which are Greek philosophy, Roman law, and 
Christianity.\" 
 
5. (SBU) SDKU MP Roman Vavrik told emboffs 11/2 that KDH 
sought support from opposition parties for its stance 
against accession talks and against Slovakia signing the EU 
constitution.  However, only the KDH and the Communist Party 
(KSS) oppose these two key foreign policies, which the vast 
majority of Slovak politicians see as crucial for Slovakia\'s 
prosperity and security.  SMK MP Lajos Ladanyi summarized 
the prevailing view when he told emboffs that cutting off 
Turkey\'s option to join the EU could send the country in the 
direction of extremism and Islamic fundamentalism. 
 
Parliament\'s Role 
----------------- 
 
6. (U) Political party dialogue was crucial to this issue 
because parliament will decide what stance the GOS will take 
in December.  Based on an amendment to the Slovak 
Constitution effective August 1, 2004, parliamentary 
decisions on EU-related issues are binding for the 
government.  The issue of opening accession talks with 
Turkey is the first test of this process.  Parliament 
started the ball rolling by requesting that the MFA prepare 
a report regarding Slovakia\'s stance on opening EU accession 
talks with Turkey. 
 
7. (SBU) The chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for EU 
Affairs, Tibor Mikus (HZDS), told poloffs 10/19 that 
committee members thought the report was incomplete and 
lacked a clear position.  On October 20, the Committee 
 
recommended postponing the parliamentary discussion on this 
topic until December and requested a new MFA report due in 
late November. However, Mikus also told poloffs that 
Slovakia is a little player in the EU, and it should watch 
and listen carefully, indicating the final decision would 
not be anti-Turkey. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) The GOS will likely flow with the prevailing stream 
in the EU regarding Turkey.  The new amendment to the 
constitution has provided a valuable tool for coalition 
parties to transfer this issue to parliament so that it 
doesn\'t create too much tension in the cabinet.  We can 
expect heated parliamentary debate from the KDH, but the 
overwhelming majority of coalition and opposition parties 
agree on the position \"open talks -yes, accession - maybe.\"

         14-16, 2004, EXBS Advisor, accompanied by a 
         representative of the Slovak Customs Directorate, drove 
         the CITS/UGA team to Vysne Nemecke and Cierna nad 
         Tisou, on the Slovak/Ukraine border, for a tour of 
         their facilities and a first hand look at Customs 
         procedures for handling licensable exports. 
 
B.   TRAINING CONDUCTED DURING REPORTING PERIOD. 
 
     1)   October 25-29 - EXBS provided Strategic Tracker 
         Training to twenty-eight Border and Alien Police (BAP) 
         officers at the Vysne Nemecke Border Station.  Three 
         Native American Customs Patrol Officers from the Tohono- 
         Odham Indian Reservation, in southern Arizona, were the 
         instructors for the course.  The students were a 
         diverse group of BAP officers, ranging in rank from Lt. 
         Colonel down to Constable.  They came from all parts of 
         Slovakia for the training.  Some had as much as 
         seventeen years of BAP service while others had only a 
         year of BAP service.  BAP officers were taught how to 
         follow tracks left by smugglers/illegal aliens and how 
         to utilize hand held GPS systems.  At the end of the 
         course, all of the BAP officers praised the training 
         and stated that they now felt confident that they could 
         follow the trail of smugglers and illegal aliens. 
 
C.   EQUIPMENT DELIVERED DURING REPORTING 
 
     1)   Thirty Garmin 12 XL Portable GPS systems valued at 
         $5,700 were delivered to the Station Commander of the

SUBJECT: SLOVAKS SEEK TO REPURCHASE TRANSPETROL FROM YUKOS 
 
REF: WARSAW 04253 
 
 1.  Summary.  Three years after selling Transpetrol, the 
operator of the Slovak portion of the Druzhba pipeline, to 
Yukos, the GOS will attempt to repurchase the company. 
Citing instability at Yukos due to its legal problems with 
the GOR, Slovak Minister of Economy Pavol Rusko announced 
that the GOS had sent a letter to Russian officials 
expressing interest in repurchasing the company.  The GOS 
would probably resell Transpetrol to another strategic 
investor.  What this development could mean for the future of 
the Odessa-Brody pipeline is still unclear.  End summary. 
 
2.  The Slovak press agency SITA reported that, at a November 
8 conference, Rusko announced the GOS\'s efforts to repurchase 
Transpetrol.  He added that he expected that the GOR would be 
interested in selling the company.  Rusko explained that 
Yukos\' planned extraordinary shareholders meeting on December 
20 could lead to a decision to liquidate the company or send 
it into bankruptcy.  He added that \"we consider the situation 
a Yukos to be serious, thus our partnership is unstable. 
Slovakia will do everything possible to get back ownership of 
Transpetrol.\"  He outlined a plan to conclude negotiations 
with the GOR within three months and complete the sale by the 
end of 2005. 
 
3.  The GOS sold 49 percent of Transpetrol, plus management 
rights, to Yukos in January 2002 for approximately USD 74 
million.  Rusko said he thought a possible repurchase price 
would be roughly the same, and added that the GOS has the 
money available to cover it.  He said the GOS would likely 
resell the company to another strategic investor and noted 
that he already had a list of potential buyers, although he 
failed to elaborate.  Rusko said another possibility is that 
the GOS would simply act as an agent for the GOR in directly 
selling Transpetrol from Yukos to a new buyer. 
 
4.  Comment.  Recently, Rusko has used the media to express 
what many feel are exaggerated opinions on business-related 
subjects.  However, if ownership of Transpetrol were to 
change hands it could possibly affect to moribund 
Odessa-Brody pipeline project designed to carry Caspian oil 
to central European markets by opening up the Slovak portion 
of the Druzhba pipeline to carry oil the final distance 
across Slovak territory.  Post will follow up with the 
Ministry of Economy and report on developments.

This is the fourth and final cable in a series on current 
GOS activities to address Roma issues. 
 
1. Summary.  Many Roma settlements in eastern Slovakia 
suffer from high rates of long-term unemployment due to low 
job creation, poor education, and in large part, 
discrimination.  In the beginning of 2004, the government 
instituted needed changes to the social benefit system, 
which had been widely criticized for supplying an income 
comparable with the average wage and providing little 
incentive to find employment.  The GOS included a bonus for 
community service work that provided an additional 30 USD a 
month.  The activation has mobilized the Roma workforce, but 
was designed only as a short-term fix to the problem of long- 
term unemployment. End Summary. 
 
Discrimination in the Workplace 
------------------------------- 
 
2. Most settlements have unemployment rates close to 100 
percent.  The only options for income are social benefits, 
black market jobs, or traveling to other countries to seek 
work.  Roma frequently state that after being invited to 
interview for a job over the phone, they are turned away 
after the potential employer sees them face-to-face.  After 
the recent passage of the anti-discrimination law, 
newspapers and TV programs have increased reporting and 
scrutiny of proprietors who refuse entrance by Roma into 
businesses or those with unfair hiring practices.  In 
addition to the government-sponsored Center for Human 
Rights, the Section for Human Rights at the Government 
Office will provide legal assistance to individuals to 
pursue court cases under the anti-discrimination law.  Jana 
Kviecinska, the Section\'s Director, predicted it would take 
a lot of court cases to get employers to change their 
attitudes. 
 
3.  Dagmar Horvathova, Director of the Roma NGO \"Nova Cesta\" 
in Michalovce in eastern Slovakia, hopes to begin a 
placement agency for Roma from settlements, providing 
service both domestically and abroad.  District unemployment 
offices and NGOs have provided training, mostly in regions 
with high unemployment and also for the majority population. 
Few private sector activities have attempted to create 
opportunities for Roma.  U.S. Steel, the largest U.S. 
investor, has hired several Roma from a neighboring village 
and provides continuing training in household money 
management. 
 
The Activation Bonus 
-------------------- 
 
4.   The prior social benefit system contributed to Roma 
unemployment since the income was roughly equal to an 
average month\'s wage and provided no incentive to be 
employed.  Romano Nevo L\'il, a newspaper circulated for the 
Roma minority, referred to the system as \"income 
substitution.\"  At the beginning of 2004, the government 
instituted significant changes to the benefit package for 
long-term unemployed to reduce total payments.  The GOS 
balanced this step by instituting a bonus for those seeking 
community service positions offered by local government. 
After lootings occurred before the first round of payments, 
the government responded by raising the bonus amount and 
allowing NGOs and the private sector to participate in the 
program. 
 
5. The Ministry of Labor (MOL) recently announced the impact 
of the reforms up to this point comparing statistics from 
last year.  Overall, the number of individuals on social 
benefits was reduced and the unemployment rate has decreased 
by 3 percent over the year.  According to the MOL, over 
sixty percent of those who are off the rolls found gainful 
employment.  Another reason for improved figures was that 
120,000 unemployed began working and received the activation 
bonus.  It is illegal for the government to collect 
statistics according to ethnicity, but it is reasonable to 
assume a significant number were Roma. 
 
6. Government officials have extended the life of this 
program for an additional year, but it is not a permanent 
feature of the social reform.  Some activists state that the 
number of jobs cannot be maintained through the winter, and 
Roma are not learning any marketable skills should the 
program end. On the other hand, Kezmarok Mayor Igor Sajtlava 
stated that the activation bonus and the mobilization of the 
workforce has been beneficial. Stereotypical attitudes that 
 
Roma do not want to work or that they are incapable of 
holding a job have begun to be chipped away.  Additionally, 
community service gives many Roma their first experience 
with a job, as many have never worked, nor seen their 
parents hold a job. 
 
Looking Forward 
--------------- 
 
7.  In July the government approved a National Plan for 
Employment 2004 to 2006.  Recently the MOL signed a 
memorandum with the European Commission on social inclusion 
with many measures focusing on disadvantaged groups.  This 
long-term strategy respective of market principles will 
gradually replace the short-term policy of bonuses.  The 
government continues to make progress in this area, however 
much more time and effort is needed.

SUBJECT: SLOVAK TIP MID-YEAR UPDATE 
 
 
1.  Summary.  Jennifer Topping, from the Office of 
Trafficking in Persons (G/TIP), visited Slovakia from 
October 22 to 26.  Topping applauded the efforts of law 
enforcement officials in investigating trafficking cases. 
She also encouraged officials to consider broader 
governmental coordination on anti-TIP initiatives by forming 
an interagency working group and appointing a trafficking 
point of contact.  In the framework of her visit, the 
embassy organized discussions with trafficking organizations 
and relevant officials to facilitate communication about the 
trafficking situation in Slovakia.  End Summary. 
 
Discussion and Working Groups 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  Trafficking is assumed by some observers to be more of a 
problem in larger cities close to borders, but areas in the 
middle of the country report more trafficking cases. 
Discussions organized in Banska Bystrica, the regional 
capital of Central Slovakia, confirmed that coordination for 
victim assistance between NGOs and law enforcement is 
lacking in these areas, more so than in the capital.  In 
January 2003, Justice Minister Lipsic founded an interagency 
working group to discuss solutions to strengthen victim 
protection laws and procedures in Slovakia.  The group has 
met twice during the course of 2004 with success.  Recently, 
Parliament passed a new law on victim assistance requiring 
police to provide victims of any crime a list of 
organizations that can help them.  Trafficking organizations 
stated that this will help foster closer cooperation between 
law enforcement officers and active NGOs. 
 
Criminal Code Changes and New Police Practices 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. Parliament approved the UN Protocol to Suppress 
Trafficking in Persons in May, and it was ratified on Sept 
21.   According to EU directives and UN requirements, 
Parliament recently amended relevant trafficking legislation 
to reflect that the crime of trafficking occurs both within 
the country\'s border and across the country\'s borders.  The 
Head of the Anti-Trafficking Unit at the Police Presidium, 
Anna Babincova, stated that the legal definition of 
trafficking was expanded to include that the trafficker must 
use fraudulent means, violence, threat, or other forms of 
coercion to elicit agreement from a victim older than 18 
years person for a crime of trafficking. 
 
4. Babincova also outlined some new initiatives from the 
anti-trafficking unit.  By January 2005, a central anonymous 
information hotline for tips about traffickers or victims 
will become operational.  She stated that police sometimes 
receive useful information pertaining to trafficking 
networks, but often too late.  The Ministry of Interior 
(MOI) postponed the plan within the reorganization of the 
police to change the anti-trafficking unit to a department. 
It continues to remain a unit under the directorship of the 
Bureau of Organized Crime. 
 
New Ministry of Labor (MOL) Lottery Grants 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  Several anti-trafficking NGOs this year received money 
from Ministry of Labor (MOL) grants funded through the state 
lottery system.  Ivan Mako, the director of the Young Roma 
Association, received 100,000 SK (3,225 USD) to operate an 
awareness program for at-risk Roma communities in Central 
Slovakia.  Dafne, an organization that assists returned 
victims, estimated that 46 percent of their clients were 
Roma.  Andrea Bucek, Director of the Regional Roma 
Plenipotentiary\'s Office, stated that this crime is a 
problem in Roma communities and needs to be addressed, 
however more immediate concerns (e.g. education, housing, 
employment) have taken precedence. 
 
6.  Two organizations are looking for funds to begin 
operating a full-time anonymous shelter specifically to 
assist and protect TIP victims.  Dafne has much of the 
necessary funding through foreign donors and the regional 
government to operate a shelter, which will cost 
approximately 130,000 USD a year.  They are currently 
negotiating with the municipal government to acquire a 
recently closed school, but the city wants to sell it for 
three million more crowns (125,000 USD) than Dafne can 
afford.  Another organization applied for money but was only 
given a third of what it needed.  With no other donors, the 
organization will likely return the money. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  A UN project slated to begin in Slovakia to support 
legal analysis, the preparation of a National Action Plan, 
and materials for the anti-trafficking unit continues to be 
delayed.  The MOI, the ministry responsible for the TIP 
agenda, has not made initial progress in these areas without 
the dispersal of project funds.  Fortunately, the MOI and 
police have been able to increasingly partner with a number 
of more active NGOs for training and public awareness 
activities to combat trafficking.  The embassy will continue 
to meet with government officials about the necessity of 
increasing inter-governmental cooperation on TIP issues.

China/Libya Arms Embargos 
------------------------- 
 
1. (C) Representatives of the MFA and MOD told DCM and 
emboffs October 19 that there was strong pressure from some 
EU countries to lift the arms embargo on China and added that 
Slovakia believed a strengthened EU Code of Conduct would 
only allow responsible exports (Refs A and B).  DCM stressed 
that would send the wrong message on human rights and 
expressed concern that lifting the China arms embargo could 
result in European materiel being aimed at the U.S. military 
in the Taiwan Straits. 
 
2. (C) DCM expressed concern about the potential exports of 
Lethal Military Equipment (LME) to state sponsors of 
terrorism such as Libya.  Such sales would hamper the Global 
War on Terrorism and, consequently, Foreign Military 
Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and 
Training (IMET) funds could be withheld from countries that 
sell LME to these states.  MFA and MOD representatives 
expressed disappointment, noting that many EU states that did 
not receive FMF or IMET assistance could export LME to Libya 
without reprisal. 
 
HZDS and Smer Welcome High-Level Belarusian Delegation; 
Encourage Slovak Engagement 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. (U) Stefan Stefanec (HZDS), head of the Trencin Regional 
Government, met November 2-3 with Konstanstsin Piachko, 
Deputy Governor of Brestska region, and Henadzi Prarouski, 
General Director of the Belarusian Chamber of Commerce. 
According to press reports, Stefanec said they agreed to 
avoid political discussions, since &this is not a concern of 
regional politicians.8  Smer MP Pavol Paska said Slovakia 
could find more suitable partners for cultural exchanges but 
added that, &democratic structures exist in Belarus.8 
Smer,s leader, Robert Fico, made an official visit to 
Belarus last year saying he was opening doors for Slovak 
business.  HZDS MP Dusan Jarjabek acknowledged the lack of a 
free press in Belarus, but &this should not preclude holding 
talks on economic issues, for example.8 
 
4.    (SBU) Robert Kalinak, Chairman of the Parliamentary 
Defense and Security Committee and SMER MP, told emboffs 
October 27 that Slovakia should not isolate Belarus because 
of Lukashenko.  Slovakia should encourage business, promote 
cultural exchanges, and attempt to engage the Belarusian 
citizens.  The international community isolated Slovakia 
under communism as well and it ended up hurting the citizens 
instead of the government. FM Eduard Kukan declared 
Lukashenko,s manipulation of the election &very bad.8  The 
MFA is providing assistance to Belarusian civil society 
through a grant to the Pontis Foundation, a Slovak NGO. 
 
Slovak Relations with Ukraine Not Dependent Upon Elections 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5.    (SBU) DCM and emboffs October 19 also raised the 
Ukrainian democracy issue.  MFA and MOD interlocutors 
emphasized Slovakia,s strategic relationship with Ukraine 
will not change drastically after the presidential elections. 
 They noted that whoever won the election would face the same 
pressures from Moscow and it was unrealistic to expect an 
instant change in Ukraine.  They said carrots must accompany 
the sticks for democracy and market development to take hold. 
 
 
New Ambassador-at-Large for Terrorism 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Peter Zsoldos, former Slovak Ambassador to the 
Persian Gulf states, described his newly created position as 
Slovak Ambassador-at-Large for Terrorism.  His exact 
responsibilities are still unclear as the MFA continues to 
reorganize.  A rough S/CT equivalent, Zsoldos will report 
directly to the Foreign Minister and direct all aspects of 
MFA counterterrorism cooperation.  Zsoldos has noted 
repeatedly his interest in training opportunities in the U.S. 
or elsewhere.  Helping him clarify his role and best 
practices in counter-terror operations would be useful. 
 
Surprise Recall Attempt of KDH Cabinet Members Fails; KDH 
Withdraws from Regional Cooperation with HZDS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7. (U) Near the end of the parliamentary session November 1, 
 
Vladimir Meciar,s party, Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS), changed its recent &cooperative mood.8  Katarina 
Tothova (HZDS) proposed a vote of confidence in Education 
Minister Martin Fronc (KDH).  Coalition MPs were not present 
in sufficient number to prevent this move, which may have 
required fewer votes than a no-confidence vote.  (Note: The 
constitution distinguishes between votes of confidence and 
votes of no confidence.  Votes of confidence usually are used 
to confirm new ministers, although the constitution does not 
state this is the only time it can be used.  Tothova sought a 
negative vote of confidence on Minister Fronc.  In theory, 
this would require 76 MPs to support the minister for him to 
keep his post.  A No-Confidence vote would require 76 MPs 
(parliamentary majority) to support the recall.  Justice 
Minister Daniel Lipsic referred the issue to the 
Constitutional Court.)  Speaker of Parliament Pavol Hrusovsky 
(KDH) postponed the confidence vote until the next day on 
disputable legal grounds.  HZDS tried to recall Hrusovsky 
November 2 in response, although both recall moves failed. 
 
8. (U) KDH,s national board October 23 gave its regional 
structures authority to form ethnic Slovak coalitions to 
defeat regional governments currently dominated by the 
Hungarian coalition (SMK), especially in the Nitra region 
(septel).  Hrusovsky announced KDH would not hold talks with 
HZDS at any level, including regional and local levels.  SDKU 
and ANO will continue to cooperate with HZDS against SMK 
regional governments.

1. (S) Summary: This is an action request--see para 3.  A 
Slovak firm proposes selling excess T-72 tanks to Azerbaijan. 
 End Summary. 
 
2. (S) Peter Peniaska, head of the Slovak arms firm Petina 
International, met with emboffs to seek USG opinion on the 
potential sale of 145 T-72 tanks to Azerbaijan.  Petina is 
acting as an intermediary to assist the GOS dispose of its 
stockpiled or surplus materiel.  Petina told emboffs the MOD 
closed the tender for the potential marketing of T-72 tanks 
to Azerbaijan in early November.  The competition is between 
two firms: Peter Peniaska\'s Petina International and Roman 
Ondrus\' Armimex.  Peniaska said Armimex is essentially a 
one-man company which appears to be a front company for 
Russian or Armenian interests.  (NOTE: Neither Armimex nor 
Ondrus are listed in the official Slovak business registry. 
Petina International is officially approved to engage in 
weapons sales.)  Petina has offered to pay the Slovak MOD 367 
million Slovak crowns for 145 T-72 tanks, in order to serve 
as the intermediary for onward sale to the Azerbaijani MOD. 
Armimex offered 70 million Slovak crowns. 
 
3.  (S) ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests guidance/information 
on USG views on such a sale.  We will, in the meantime, 
engage MFA arms export officials to gauge their reaction to 
it.    Post recalls that USG recently chose not to join UK in 
opposing a proposed Slovak sale of SU-25 ground-attack 
aircraft to Armenia on the grounds that Armenian air was 
offset by Azeri armor and wonders whether that would still be 
the case.  (The UK and German embassies, in the end, 
conducted a joint demarche on that sale; chagrined MFA 
interlocutors told them the sale was a \"political decision\" 
made by EconMin Rusko.)

outcome are divided--the Prime Minister\'s foreign policy 
advisor is optimistic about a Yushchenko win, while MFA 
policy planners give the nod to Yanukovich.  The MFA Director 
General for EU Affairs cautioned against hasty negative 
declarations following the election in order to avoid giving 
Kuchma an excuse for invalidating the entire election.  MFA 
Ukraine desk officer refused to speculate on the outcome, but 
predicted cooler relations with a Victor Yanukovich-led 
Ukraine.  End summary. 
 
A Call for Post-Election Caution 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Director General for EU Affairs Frantisek Ruzicka 
expressed caution and concern to DCM and POLEC Chief November 
15 about international reaction to the second round. 
Although EU foreign ministers will \"certainly\" discuss the 
elction at the Nov 22 GAERC, Ruzicka worried that a premature 
negative appraisal from international observers and 
commentators might give Kuchma an opening to invalidate the 
\"flawed\" elections, especially if there were a Yushchenko 
victory, thus allowing him to stay in office until elections 
could be rescheduled.  With votes being counted up to ten 
days after the elections, it might be better to wait until 
the process has run its full course before making a final 
judgment.  (Comment: Given Ruzicka\'s near-constant engagement 
with other EU interlocutors through COREU and the CFSP 
coordination process, his comments may perhaps reflect 
concerns of other EU member states.)  Milan Jezovica, the 
PM\'s foreign policy advisor, rejected this concern in a 
separate conversation with DCM November 16, saying that 
Kuchma would not risk popular unrest if the election results 
were clearly disrespected. 
 
The View from the Desk 
---------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Poloff delivered reftel demarche November 16 to MFA 
Ukraine desk officer Radoslav Kusenda.  Kusenda reiterated 
that the GOS wants to see a free and fair election in Ukraine 
and remains concerned about antidemocratic actions, but did 
not see Slovakia taking a hardline stance against its eastern 
neighbor.  Slovakia will send its largest observer mission in 
its history to Ukraine and will reevaluate its foreign policy 
towards Ukraine after the ballot count. 
 
4.  (U) The GOS and Slovak NGOs observed the first round and 
will do the same for the second round vote.  108 Slovaks will 
have observed one of the two votes; 20 percent observed the 
first vote and 80 percent will observe the upcoming vote. 
Kusenda agreed with the U.S. description of Ukrainian 
pre-election and first round voting irregularities.  The GOS 
supported the OSCE statement following the first round vote. 
 
5.  (C) After the vote count is completed December 6, the GOS 
will evaluate its policy towards Ukraine.  Kusenda described 
the first round,s outcome as &administratively 
complicated.8  It was not obviously antidemocratic as in 
Belarus, he said, but not completely free and fair either. 
Any policy shifts, including visa restrictions, would be made 
in close cooperation with the EU.  He said bilateral visa 
restrictions are difficult, since Slovakia borders on 
Ukraine. 
 
6.  (C) Kusenda expected the GOS to have cooler relations 
with a Viktor Yanukovich-led Ukraine.  While both candidates 
would need to court the same internal power interests, he 
said, Yanukovich would draw more heavily on the eastern 
Ukrainian industrial class and forge strong links with 
Russia.  Victor Yushchenko would draw Ukraine closer to 
Brussels, giving the GOS a greater role in helping shape 
European policy towards Ukraine, he said.  Kusenda described 
the EU policy towards Ukraine in the last year as 
&incoherent.8 (NOTE: GOS often presents Ukraine as one of 
its two foreign policy priorities and seeks a leadership role 
on Ukrainian issues at the EU.)

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, LO 
SUBJECT: TRADE UNIONS REFUSE \"EXCLUSIVE\" AGREEMENT WITH SMER 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - protect accordingly 
 
1. (U) Summary.  Delegates to the Fifth KOZ Congress on November 
12 and 13 rejected a proposed agreement with the opposition party 
Smer for closer cooperation on common goals.  The tone of the 
program was extremely critical of the government and a high- 
ranking GOS official\'s address received boos and hollers from the 
participants.  The delegates re-elected the KOZ leadership that 
has been at loggerheads with the government, which led to the 
recent repeal of the Tripartite Law.  End Summary. 
 
KOZ Delegates Refuse Smer Agreement 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On November 12 and 13, the Confederation of Trade Unions 
(KOZ), a federation of unions from various industries, held its 
fifth congress to elect its executive board and discuss future 
initiatives.  Although the Chairman of the opposition party Smer 
(\"Direction\") Robert Fico met with great applause at the 
congress, the delegates declined to support a proposed 
cooperation agreement.  Members voted to continue working with 
Smer, but not at the exclusion of other parties with similar 
platforms.  Participants also recalled the suspended relations 
between a single political party and KOZ during the Meciar era. 
The Deputy Speaker of Parliament, HZDS leader Viliam Veteska, and 
Communist Party (KSS) Chairman Jozef Svec were also in 
attendance. 
 
Saktor Maintains Leadership of KOZ 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) KOZ President Ivan Saktor, who ran unopposed for re- 
election, retained the leadership of KOZ even though the 
confederation suffered several failures under his watch.  Over 
the past several years, KOZ has lost nearly 300,000 members.  The 
organization spearheaded a signature drive for the April 2004 
referendum on early elections, which failed due to lack of voter 
participation.  The government repealed the Tripartite Law, 
removing KOZ\'s status as a partner in social dialogue, stating 
that the political nature of the confederation and its heightened 
criticism of the GOS reform program hindered the tripartite 
process.  Saktor\'s close collaboration with Smer leader Robert 
Fico may have hastened the government\'s decision. 
 
KOZ Leadership Calls for Revenge 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The congress featured an unbalanced film about protest 
activities and events since the last congress that was highly 
critical of the government.  The movie was accompanied by an 
appeal from Saktor for \"vengeance, revenge, and payback\" because 
of the negative impact of reforms on workers and unfulfilled 
governmental promises.  When PM Dzurinda appeared on the screen, 
delegates of the congress booed and whistled.  The president of 
the Association of Town and Villages (ZMOS) Michael Sykora told 
poloffs that KOZ has made a big mistake in vehemently attacking 
the government and putting in place more obstacles to future 
cooperation. 
 
5. (U) Education State Secretary Frantisek Toth, one of the few 
government officials present, asked to address the wound-up 
crowd.  He stated that he disagreed with some KOZ policies, but 
stressed that a dialogue needs two partners.  Toth stated, \"It is 
important to teach those who are hungry how to catch a fish, 
rather than let them simply protest that they are hungry.\"  The 
public booed his speech and loud applause forced him to hastily 
conclude his comments.  KOZ President Saktor noted the courage he 
displayed in making a presentation to this audience. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: The KOZ gathering did little to dispel the GOS 
impression that KOZ has become more of a political organization 
than one truly representing workers\' rights.  Smer might be 
disappointed at the missed opportunity for \"exclusive\" support 
from the labor unions, especially after having cooperated closely 
on the signature drive for early elections early in 2004. 
However, with KOZ membership falling rapidly, the organization 
would certainly lose members loyal to other opposition parties if 
it did not keep those doors open.

REF: A. STATE 244333 
 
     B. STATE 247288 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald Weiser for reason 1.4 (d). 
 
1. (SBU) DCM hosted lunch 11/15 for the MFA\'s \"CFSP\" team: 
Acting Director of the Division for European Affairs 
Frantisek Ruzicka, COREPER Director Anna Turinicova, and 
European Correspondent Lubomir Rehak.  They discussed the 
latest thinking on the China arms embargo, Turkish accession, 
and Cuba, among other issues.  On 11/16, poloff demarched 
Rehak on the GAERC agenda items described in reftel. 
 
2. (C) MEPP: Rehak agreed that Arafat\'s death presents new 
opportunities to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process. 
When told we hope EU governments will consider generous 
contributions to the IFC PEP-MENA Facility, he said, \"I think 
they will.\" 
 
3. (C) China: Ruzicka expressed the opinion that we will get 
through the EU-China summit with the arms embargo intact. 
Many countries, Slovakia included, have expressed serious 
reservations about the still-undefined \"toolbox\" to 
strengthen the code of conduct.  However, momentum to lift 
the embargo is strong within the EU.  We will continue 
demarching top Slovak officials per ref B. 
 
4. (C) Kosovo: Rehak agreed that local 
government/decentralization was crucial, but the question is 
whether to allow \"ethnic municipalities.\"  Slovakia thinks it 
would be appropriate to form such municipalities and to allow 
Serbs to govern themselves, noting however that every 
nationality represented in any muncipality must have the same 
rights.  He said Slovakia believes the EU must cooperate more 
closely with the U.S. on Kosovo, since the U.S. influence is 
very strong with the Albanians.  He praised the U.S. position 
on Macedonia as a \"diplomatic and clever step of the U.S.\" 
and an example of why the EU should consult more with the 
U.S. on such issues.  Rehak added that it would be 
appropriate for the ICTY to try any indicted Albanians, 
because up to now only Serbs have been tried. 
 
5. (C) Belarus: Rehak agreed it would be most effective for 
the US and EU to coordinate possible negative actions against 
individuals in the Belarussian leadership, particularly the 
issue of whether to add Lukashenko to the list of those to be 
sanctioned.  Slovakia wants to intensify dialog with 
mid-level officials in government structures, many of whom 
will likely remain in government even when Lukashenko is 
gone.  Slovakia wants to avoid inflaming relations, which 
could result in even greater isolation of the citizens of 
Belarus.  For example, the Slovak MFA is providing a grant to 
a Slovak NGO working in Belarus to strengthen civil society 
and to get information out to the regions of Belarus.  A 
Slovak journalist misquoted an MFA official as characterizing 
this program\'s aim to \"democratize\" Belarus.  That misquote 
resulted in a demarche from the Belarussian ambassador in 
Bratislava, as well as the Slovak charge d\'affaires being 
called into the MFA in Minsk for scolding.  In order to 
ensure that this important people-to-people program can 
continue, and that the Slovaks are not expelled from Belarus 
or prevented from traveling in the future, the MFA must tread 
carefully around the Belarussian government. 
 
6. (C) Cyprus Aid and Trade: Rehak said Cypriot efforts to 
block the aid and trade package for Turkish Cypriots would 
\"probably only be resolved December 17.\" 
 
7. (C) Turkey: Foreign Minister Kukan visited Ankara November 
10-11, and then cut the official part of the visit short to 
fly with the Turkish PM to Yasser Arafat\'s funeral.  The MFA 
has drafted a position paper favoring the start of Turkish 
accession talks, though it is intentionally vague on setting 
the exact date and conditions under which to begin the talks, 
in order to give PM Dzurinda the mandate and the flexibility 
to adopt the common EU position on December 17.  Furthermore, 
it does not guarantee Turkish membership in the EU.  MFA 
officials are briefing Parliament November 19 about Kukan\'s 
visit to Turkey and the MFA position paper.  The paper has 
been submitted to the inter-ministerial process; the cabinet 
will discuss it November 24; it will go to Parliament for 
discussion by the EU Committee on November 29; and then will 
go to a plenary session of Parliament for approval. 
 
8. (C) Rehak told poloff 11/19 that the Austrian FM had 
dinner with Kukan \"a couple days ago\" and that they discussed 
Turkey.  However, there was \"no special request\" from Austria 
regarding Slovakia\'s position on the issue.  He also said 
that the MFA was watching the policies of other member states 
unfold, but that the Austrian opinion did not influence the 
Slovak position.

SUBJECT: TRANSPARENCY OF BUDGETS/MILITARY SPENDING 
 
REF: STATE 239929 
 
1.  THE FOLLOWING ARE ANSWERS, PER REFTEL, TO THE AUDIT AND 
REPORTING PROCESS FOR MILITARY EXPENDITURES IN SLOVAKIA 
BASED ON RESPONSES FROM THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (MOF). 
 
2. HOW ARE MILITARY EXPENDITURES AUDITED?  ACCORDING TO 
SLOVAK LEGISLATION, THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE (MOD), AS WELL 
AS OTHER MINISTRIES, ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL 
AUDIT, IN THE SAME WAY THAT COMMERCIAL FIRMS DO.  HOWEVER, 
THE MOD REPORTS QUARTERLY ON THE MANAGEMENT OF BUDGET FUNDS 
TO THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE OF DEFENSE AND SECURITY.  AT 
THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR, THE MOD COMPILES A FINAL ANNUAL 
DEFENSE ACCOUNT BALANCE, WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY THE 
PARLIAMENT AS PART OF THE OVERALL CLOSURE OF ACCOUNTS FOR 
THE NATIONAL BUDGET. 
 
3. WHO AUDITS MILITARY EXPENDITURES?  IN ADDITION TO THE 
REVIEWS CARRIED OUT THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE, THE MOD IS 
DIRECTLY AUDITED BY THE SUPREME AUDIT OFFICE, WHICH AUDITS 
THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE RESOURCES FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS OF THE 
GOS.  ANOTHER BODY, WHICH MAY REVIEW THE MOD\'S SPENDING, IS 
A SPECIAL CONTROL SECTION OF THE MOF.  THIS UNIT CONDUCTS 
RANDOM INSPECTIONS AT ALL DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE GOS, 
FOCUSING ON SPECIFICALLY SELECTED OPERATIONS AND/OR 
PURCHASES.  THE OFFICE OF THE CABINET ALSO HAS SOME, 
ALTHOUGH LIMITED, COMPETENCE. 
 
4.  TO WHOM ARE THE AUDITS REPORTED?  THE AUDIT REPORTS ARE 
SUBMITTED TO THE CABINET, THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE, THE 
MINISTER OF FINANCE AND THE PARLIAMENT.  CIVILIANS DEALING 
WITH THE DEFENSE AUDIT INCLUDE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND THE 
CABINET, AS WELL AS OFFICERS OF THE MOD AND THE MOF. 
 
5. ARE ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE THE AUDITS CIVILIAN 
AUTHORITIES?  ALL OF THE AGENCIES LISTED IN PARAGRAPH FOUR, 
EXCEPT THE MOD, ARE CIVILIAN AGENCIES.  BY SLOVAK LAW, THE 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE MUST ALSO BE A CIVILIAN.  ACCORDING TO 
THE MOD, AS MANY AS 80 PERCENT OF ITS PERSONNEL ARE 
CIVILIANS.  IN 2004, SLOVAKIA BECAME A MEMBER OF NATO, AND 
THE MOD ADOPTED A PLAN OF INCREASING ITS CIVIL MANAGEMENT. 
 
6. TO THE BEST OF POST\'S ABILITY, OUTLINE ANY DEFICIENCIES 
IN THE AUDIT PROCESS.  POST DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO 
EXAMINE THE ADEQUACY OF GOS AUDITING PROCEDURES. 
 
7. PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE REGARDING THE 
NATIONAL BUDGET PROCESS AND IN PARTICULAR THE MILITARY 
COMPONENT OF THE BUDGET.  THE STATE BUDGET IS THE BASIC 
INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL POLICY IN SLOVAKIA.  THE 
CABINET DEVELOPS A BASIC BUDGETARY OUTLOOK FOR THE NEW 
BUDGET YEAR, AND THEN, ON THE BASIS OF THAT OUTLOOK, THE MOF 
CREATES THE DETAILS OF BUDGETARY ALLOCATIONS FOR MINISTRIES 
AND OTHER BUDGET-FINANCED BODIES. 
 
8. THE MOD USUALLY BEGINS PREPARING ITS BUDGET NO LATER THAN 
JUNE, AFTER THE MOF PUBLISHES INSTRUCTIONS ON DRAFTING THE 
BUDGET.  LIMITS ON BUDGETARY ALLOCATIONS FOR EACH MINISTRY 
ARE OBLIGATORY.  THE MOD ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS AND SETS 
PRIORITIES FOR THE ASSEMBLY OF THE BUDGET FOR THE UPCOMING 
YEAR, WHICH IS WORKED OUT ON THE BASIS OF DETAILED ESTIMATES 
OF EXPENDITURES.  THIS DETAILED PROPOSAL MUST BE SUBMITTED 
TO THE MOF BY THE END OF JULY. 
 
9. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS THEN ASSEMBLED BY THE MOF AND 
RETURNED TO THE CABINET FOR A SECOND REVIEW. AFTER THE 
CABINET GIVES IT FINAL APPROVAL, THE PROPOSAL MUST BE 
SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT BY OCTOBER 15.  UNLIKE OTHER LAWS, 
THE STATE BUDGET DRAFT ONLY HAS TWO READINGS.  ONCE 
SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT, THE PROPOSAL IS DISTRIBUTED TO ALL 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES INCLUDING THE COMMITTEE FOR DEFENSE 
AND SECURITY.  IF NO AMENDMENTS ARE APPROVED, THE FINAL 
READING STARTS IMMEDIATELY WITH THE VOTE ON THE BUDGET AS A 
WHOLE.  HOWEVER, IF ANY AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED, THE 
DEBATE IN THE FINAL READING IS LIMITED ONLY TO THE AMENDED 
PARTS OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. 
 
10. IF THE PARLIAMENT IS NOT ABLE TO APPROVE THE PROPOSED 
STATE BUDGET BY THE END OF THE YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT OPERATES 
ON A PROVISIONAL BUDGET FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR; 
THIS OCCURRED IN 1999.  IF THE BUDGET IS APPROVED, THE 
PRESIDENT MUST THEN SIGN IT INTO LAW OR RETURN IT TO THE 
PARLIAMENT.  IN EFFECT, THE PRESIDENT HAS LITTLE POWER OVER 
THE BUDGET. 
 
11.  THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAS PRAISED SLOVAKIA 
FOR ITS CONTINUED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE FISCAL MANAGEMENT AND 
TRANSPARENCY.  IN 2004, THE GOS INTRODUCED A THREE-YEAR 
FISCAL FRAMEWORK AND MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ADOPTING 
THE EUROPEAN UNION\'S PREFERRED FISCAL REPORTING METHOD, ESA- 
95, BASED ON ACCRUAL BUDGETING.  THE GOS IS EXPECTED SOON TO 
 
INTRODUCE THREE-YEAR EXPENDITURE CEILINGS THAT WOULD BE 
SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL.  THIS WOULD ENTAIL 
SPECIFYING SUB-CEILINGS ON KEY COMPONENTS OF PUBLIC SPENDING 
THAT NEED TO BE REDUCED, AND IDENTIFYING MEASURES TO 
MAINTAIN THESE MEDIUM-TERM EFFORTS. 
 
12. ARE PRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES PRIORITIZED OVER 
UNPRODUCTIVE?  THE TRANSITION FROM A PLANNED TO A MARKET 
ECONOMY IN THE PAST YEARS HAS FORCED STRINGENT LIMITS ON 
SLOVAK DEFENSE EXPENDITURES.  THE BULK OF MILITARY 
EXPENDITURES GO TO FINANCE BASIC OPERATIONAL COSTS AND 
MILITARY TRAINING, WHILE MODERNIZATION IS LIMITED.  DEFENSE 
EXPENDITURES HOVER AROUND 2.0 PERCENT OF GDP, THE LEVEL 
RECOMMENDED BY NATO. 
 
13. IS THERE A MECHANISM FOR BUDGET PRIORITIZATION DEBATE? 
AFTER THE CABINET SUBMITS THE STATE BUDGET TO THE 
PARLIAMENT, VARIOUS COMMITTEES DISCUSS THE BUDGET PROPOSAL 
AND PRIORITIES AND RECOMMEND CHANGES TO IT BEFORE IT IS 
SUBMITTED TO THE FULL PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL. 
 
14. DOES THE COUNTRY\'S DEFENSE BUDGET INCLUDE ARMY, POLICE 
AND SECURITY FORCES?  DEFENSE EXPENDITURES ARE DEFINED AS 
THOSE MADE BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY TO MEET 
THE NEEDS OF THE ARMED FORCES (NATO SURVEY DPAO 2001 0590). 
THEREFORE, THE ARMY, MILITARY POLICE AND MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE ARE IN THE MOD BUDGET.  PARAMILITARY FORCES OF 
THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR (MOI) AND THE POLICE ARE INCLUDED 
IN THE MOI BUDGET.  THE RAILWAY PARAMILITARY FORCES AND 
RAILROAD POLICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT, 
POST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUDGET.  PENITENTIARY AND 
JUDICIAL POLICE ARE PAID FROM THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE 
BUDGET. 
 
15. TO POST\'S KNOWLEDGE ARE THERE SIGNIFICANT OFF-BUDGET 
MILITARY RECEIPTS?  TODAY, SLOVAKIA DOES NOT HAVE 
SIGNIFICANT OFF-BUDGET MILITARY RECEIPTS.  HOWEVER, IN THE 
PAST, THERE WERE SUBSTANTIAL OFF-BUDGET RECEIPTS, SUCH AS 
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS REIMBURSEMENTS AND 
REVENUES FROM THE MILITARY AVIATION ACADEMY.

SEEKS INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
 
 
1. SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.  ON NOVEMBER 19, THE WORST 
WINDS IN 70 YEARS STRUCK SLOVAKIA\'S HIGH TATRAS ALPINE 
FOREST AREA, SNAPPING TREES LIKE TOOTHPICKS.  AN AREA OF 
APPROXIMATELY 250 SQUARE MILES WAS DEVASTATED, INCLUDING 
LARGE SWATHS OF LAND WHERE NEARLY ALL TREES WERE DESTROYED. 
ALTHOUGH ONLY TWO FATALITIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND MOST 
BUILDINGS SURVIVED, CONSIDERABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC 
DAMAGE ARE LIKELY.  GOS HAS SOUGHT INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
IN DEALING WITH THIS DISASTER, AND DONATIONS FROM 
INTERNATIONAL AND PRIVATE DONORS HAVE ALREADY BEEN RECEIVED. 
HOWEVER, THE SLOVAKS ARE NOT CERTAIN HOW TO PROCEED AND 
WOULD LIKELY WELCOME ADVICE FROM U.S. EXPERTS.  POST SEEKS 
DEPT GUIDANCE ON TWO PROPOSED RESPONSES: 
 
-- A USD 25,000 DONATION FROM THE AMBASSADOR\'S 
DISCRETIONARY EMERGENCY FUND, AND 
 
-- A DVC CONFERENCE BETWEEN USG AND GOS OFFICIALS TO SHARE 
U.S. EXPERIENCE AND SUGGESTIONS FROM SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. 
 
END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. 
 
2. Winds of 100 mph destroyed a heavily forested area more 
than 40 miles long and 6 miles wide in north-central 
Slovakia.  The Minister of Agriculture estimates that 2.5 to 
3 million cubic meters of timber have fallen, equal to about 
90 percent of Slovakia\'s yearly production of soft wood. 
Large sections of electrical lines were completely 
destroyed, but roads and buildings apparently survived 
fairly well. 
 
3. The GOS has called in the army to help remove debris and 
requested financial assistance from the EU to help restore 
the area.  Businesses and local governments have also 
donated funds to restore what had been one of Slovakia\'s 
national treasures.  The timing of the disaster is 
especially difficult for the local economy, which is highly 
dependent on tourism including skiing.  Ecological damage is 
expected to be exacerbated by run-off in the spring.  We 
request fiscal data to support a USD 25,000 pledge from the 
Ambassador\'s discretionary emergency fund to contribute to 
reconstruction activities. 
 
4. Although Slovakia has been fortunate in avoiding an 
immediate humanitarian disaster, many hardships are sure to 
affect this region for the foreseeable future.  However, at 
this point the Slovaks aren\'t even sure what help they need 
and what questions to ask in order to begin the recovery 
effort.  Post requests Dept seek advice from USG agencies 
related to forestry, environmental protection and aid issues 
to identify U.S. experts who could offer advice  regarding 
restoration efforts and potential long-term problems, and 
where to start.  Post would then place a formal request for 
a  DVC.

SUBJECT: SLOVAK REPONSE TO THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE 
 
 
Classified By: CDA Scott Thayer for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY. The Slovak government and private citizens 
are very concerned about the turn of events in Ukraine.  Ivan 
Korcok, MFA State Secretary, convoked the Ukrainian 
Ambassador to Slovakia November 25 to express his strong 
concern about the undemocratic events and called for a new 
election in disputed eastern regions.  While the public 
frets, the government has released a statement critical of 
the elections and will send Slovakia\'s first president, 
Michal Kovac, to Kiev November 27. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S) Radoslav Kusenda, MFA Ukraine desk officer, told 
poloff November 26 the GOS will follow the EU common 
position. Kusenda characterized the GOS position as a 
Visegrad position, tracking most closely the Polish and 
Hungarian positions.  Michal Kovac\'s official trip November 
27-28 to Kiev comes at the request of FM Eduard Kukan and is 
intended to follow the Polish lead in sending Lech Walesa to 
Kiev.  The GOS intends to show their solidary with the 
Ukrainian people, drawing parallels to their own historical 
experience.  Kovac will meet with the Slovak Ambassador to 
Ukraine and other goverment officials yet to be determined. 
He will give a speech in downtown Kiev to the demonstrators. 
 
3. (S) Kusenda said Korcok\'s 15-minute meeting with the 
Ukrainian Ambassador noted the common EU position and the 
GOS\' intention to send Kovac to Kiev.  The Ukrainian 
Ambassador noted that any shortfalls in the election process 
in some districts would have to be resovled by the courts. 
He discounted any possibility of another election.  The 
Ambassador also noted different election observers 
characterized the democratic nature of the election 
differently, apparently referring to CIS observers. 
 
4. (S) That same day, the Ukrainian PolCouns (protect) 
approached DCM at a conference to say that Western help was 
needed to keep PM Viktor Yanukovych out of office.  He 
expressed privately, but openly to various conference 
participants his pro-opposition views.  Publicly, when asked 
about the state of affairs in Ukraine November 23, he stated 
only that results were preliminary, and he could not further 
comment. 
 
Public Reaction 
--------------- 
 
5. (SBU) While visible public mobilization has been limited 
(twenty youth protested in front of the Ukrainian embassy, 
carrying orange strips in support of Yushchenko), Ukraine\'s 
flawed election is the top topic of conversation among 
pundits and citizens this week.  Some private Slovaks have 
expressed concern that allowing Yanukovych to walk away with 
the elections will cause an increase in lawlessness, which 
will trickle over the border into Slovakia.  They are also 
alarmed by the strong Russian support for the flawed results, 
recalling with trepidation the day Russian tanks rolled into 
Bratislava in 1968. 
 
6. (SBU) President Ivan Gasparovic said publicly November 24, 
&Slovakia has good relations with Ukraine ) above all in 
regard to trade and economic matters and sees it (Ukraine) as 
a partner country in the future.8  He continued, &the 
positions taken by NATO and the EU will be decisive for 
Slovakia.8  (Comment: Gasparovic\'s statement reflects 
long-term policy to keep citizen-to-citizen relations strong 
and maintain important trade ties across the border.  End 
comment.) 
 
7. (U) An MFA press release November 25 stated: 
 
&The Slovak Republic follows with extraordinary concern 
attempts of the current leadership of Ukraine through 
publication of manipulated results of the second round of 
presidential elections to sharpen the unprecedented domestic 
political situation in Ukraine.  We regret to state that in 
spite of numerous notices and appeals from the side of 
international community the current leadership of the state 
did not secure free and democratic elections in Ukraine. 
 
\"We consider the official announcement of the second round of 
presidential elections results dishonest and contradicting 
the real choice of the Ukrainian voters.  We appeal all 
participated parties of the domestic-political conflict to 
solve the situation through dialogue.  We urge Ukrainian 
leadership to avoid violent means in solving this situation.8

1. (C) POLEC Chief delivered reftel demarche to the MFA 
European Correspondent Lubomir Rehak on November 30.  Rehak 
said the MFA had sent its delegation in Brussels \"a different 
instruction\" on November 29.  Slovakia thinks the draft 
language being circulated on ICTY conditionality is \"too 
strong,\" and would like to see a more balanced review of 
Croatia\'s progress.  Slovakia will insist on compliance with 
the ICTY, but does not want Carla del Ponte\'s word to be the 
sole decision-making factor on Croatia\'s progress.  Croatia 
is doing well in other spheres and can serve as a good 
example for other Balkan states. 
 
2. (C) Rehak agreed on the importance of a united front 
between the U.S. and EU and suggested the Slovak position 
\"could change.\" 
 
3. (C) Rehak said that Slovakia was not convinced a hard-line 
approach was the most effective way to win cooperation with 
ICTY.  He shared an informal paper on Kosovo (the Slovak 
contribution to the analysis of SITCEN GS of the Council), 
highlighting the idea that the arrrest of Ramush Haradinaj in 
Kosovo would send a signal to other Balkan countries that the 
ICTY wasn\'t targeting only certain nations.  Public 
perception against sending other indictees to the Hague 
(Mladic, Gotovina) could be softened.  Partial text follows 
(entire paper faxed to EUR/NCE): 
 
\"The situation in Kosovo and in the all-Serbian context could 
be significantly influenced by the realization of Carla del 
Ponte\'s notified intention to issue a warrant on several 
k/Albanians, above all Ramush Haradinaj.  There is no need to 
be afraid of this step despite threats that Pristina is 
distributing around the whole world; there is no threat of a 
national uprising and the smaller organized riots can be 
handled by KFOR.  Television broadcasting of the trial with 
Haradinaj would, similarly as the Milosevic trial in Serbia, 
contribute to revealing ways the radicals were \"fighting\" for 
independence of Kosovo and naturally, in the public opinion 
the radicals would slide to the margin of public life.  It 
can be assumed that a trial with Haradinaj would also 
significantly contribute to Belgrade\'s willingness to 
extradite Ratko Mladic and the Serbian \"Kosovo\" generals to 
the Hague.  Undoubtedly, the Serbian public stance on Kosovo 
would improve, bringing more willingness to resolving its 
status.\"

1. (C) Branislav Bohacik, Director of the Judicial 
Cooperation in Criminal Matters Division of the Slovak 
Ministry of Justice, told emboffs 11/19 that Slovakia wants 
to update its bilateral extradition treaty with the United 
States and looks forward to negotiations on a bilateral 
protocol to the U.S.-EU treaty on extradition.  He was 
especially interested in opening talks on a bilateral mutual 
legal assistance treaty (MLAT). 
 
2. (C) Polec chief probed Bohacik about the potential to 
extradite Slovak nationals to the U.S.  He answered that it 
would be nearly impossible.  The only reason the Slovaks had 
changed their laws to allow extradition of nationals was for 
judicial cooperation within the EU, and that had been a hard 
fight.  Even with caveats that exist in some EU countries, 
such as allowing convicted citizens to serve their sentences 
at home and not extraditing in cases where the death penalty 
could be awarded, he could not imagine that Slovakia would 
ever agree to extradite its citizens so far away. 
 
3. (C) Bohacik requested a point of contact in the State 
Department, with whom he can informally exchange information 
on particular cases and points of law.  Post is aware of at 
least one potential case pending in the U.S. which could 
involve an extradition request of a Slovak national, and 
strongly recommends establishing such a relationship with Mr. 
Bohacik.  We would be happy to facilitate email or telephone 
contact, once we have permission from L.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
Parliament Instructs GOS to Open Turkish Accession Talks 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
1. (SBU) Parliament November 30 approved the MFA\'s draft 
resolution instructing the GOS to adopt an EU common 
position in favor of opening accession talks with Turkey. 
MFA representatives and PM Dzurinda\'s foreign policy advisor 
clarified to us that the caveat requiring \"political 
conditions\" meant satisfying the Copenhagen criteria.  The 
only party opposed was the Christian Democrat Movement, 
which in turn proposed a second resolution acknowledging 
\"the genocide of Armenians in 1915, in which hundreds of 
thousands of Armenians who lived in the Ottoman Empire died 
and considers it to be a crime against humanity.\"  That 
resolution also passed. 
 
EuroAtlantic Security Conference Attracts Wide Audience 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
2. (U) A conference on the new security environment in 
Europe, organized by the Euro-Atlantic Center (a student 
group at the foreign affairs faculty of Matej Bel University 
in Banska Bystrica) brought together speakers from 
throughout Europe, including the DCM who talked about NATO\'s 
new priorities.  The November 23-25 conference focused on 
strategic security policy concepts, the nature of threats, 
and defense transformation and attracted approximately 100 
attendees. 
 
3. (U) Serbian Ambassador to Slovakia Miroslav Kopecni told 
participants that Serbia and Montenegro should join NATO at 
the same time as its Balkan neighbors.  To the visible 
annoyance of the Croatian Ambassador who just finished 
presenting the merits of Croatia\'s rapid accession, Kopecni 
described Serbia as \"the poor cousin but a member of the 
European family\" and warned against drawing new dividing 
lines in the Balkans or isolating Serbia.  He said Serbia 
and Montenegro should join the PfP, NATO, and the EU \"in 
that sequence.\"  Kopecni said almost 100 percent of Serbs 
favor EU accession and more than 50 percent favor NATO 
accession.  He noted that only \"right-wing organizations\" 
and \"socialists\" still oppose NATO accession and public 
approval for NATO accession has been growing since KFOR 
quelled the March riots in Kosovo. 
 
4. (U) Rastislav Kacer, Slovak Ambassador to the U.S., said 
he thought Europeans were increasingly apathetic towards 
security.  He said talk about the importance of security is 
not reflected in declining defense budgets.  He described 
NATO as the best forum for defense planning and security 
policy, adding that EU defense planning lacked the 
\"bureaucratic creativity\" needed to increase defense 
capabilities and avoid distorting political visions of 
security. 
 
Kidnapped Slovak Humanitarian Worker Freed 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) Kidnappers released Miriam Jevikova, a 28-year old 
Slovak student, in late November.  Jevikova was kidnapped in 
June while working in North Ossetia for the Czech 
Organization for Aid to Refugees (OPU).  Media reports 
credit the Russian intelligence service with securing her 
release.  The Russian federal police and Jevikova\'s family 
have not provided details of the release despite some Czech 
politicians calling for this information.  Kidnappers 
previously demanded a one million dollar ransom.

SUBJECT: GOS PASSES 2005 BUDGET WITH INDEPENDENTS\' SUPPORT 
 
 
1.  Summary.  The Slovak parliament voted 82-63 to approve 
the 2005 GOS budget.  The lawmakers also approved the 
country\'s budget outline through 2007, the first multi-year 
plan ever, a decisive step for Slovakia\'s ambition to adopt 
the Euro by 2009.  Once again, the ruling coalition relied 
upon independent MPs to secure passage.  The budget must 
still be signed by the President to become law.  End 
summary. 
 
---------- 
PARAMETERS 
---------- 
2.  On December 9, Slovak lawmakers approved the 2005 state 
budget with an overall deficit of 3.8 percent of GDP, an 
improvement compared to the 3.97 percent of GDP target for 
2004.  Costs related to pension reform, which starting 
January 1, 2005 allows Slovaks to shift half of their 
pension premiums from state-run to newly created private 
accounts, will equal 0.4 percent of GDP. 
 
3.  In the 150-seat Parliament, a total of 82 deputies voted 
for the bill, 63 against it, and five were absent.  The 
ruling coalition currently controls only 69 votes, and 
secured 12 votes from independent MPs (including Ivan Simko, 
formerly of the Free Forum caucus), and one renegade member 
of the Free Forum, Alexej Ivanko.  Following the ballot, 
Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said the agreement was reached 
at the last minute and \"the budget talks had been the 
toughest in Slovakia\'s history.\" 
 
4.  In nominal terms, the 2005 spending plan predicts 
revenues of SKK 257.2 billion (USD 8.8 billion), up 10.8 
percent from 2004, and expenditures of SKK 318.7 billion 
(USD 10.9 billion), up 2.6 percent.  This leaves a deficit 
of SKK 61.5 billion (USD 2.1 billion), versus SKK 78.4 
billion (USD 2.6 billion) in 2004.  The budget assumes real 
annual GDP growth of 4.5 percent compared to an estimated 
4.7 percent in 2004, annual inflation of 3.3 percent versus 
7.8 percent this year, and an unemployment rate of 14.4 
percent, down from 14.6 percent in 2004.  Analysts feel 
these assumptions are conservative, and therefore expect the 
GOS\'s performance to be even better than forecast. 
 
--------------- 
MULTI-YEAR PLAN 
--------------- 
5.  For the first time in the Slovak history, lawmakers also 
approved a multi-year spending plan, with 2006\'s budget 
deficit set at 3.9 percent of GDP and 2007\'s at 3 percent. 
(NOTE: Cutting the deficit below 3 percent of GDP is one of 
the criteria to qualify for Euro adoption).  The cost of 
overhauling the pension system will equal 1 percent of GDP 
in 2006 and 1.1 percent in 2007. 
 
6.  Comment.  Public expenditures, which equaled 44 percent 
of GDP in 2002, should account for 39.5 percent of GDP by 
2006.  In spite of a smaller role by the state in the 
economy, the GOS was able to increase public expenditures by 
10 percent in 2005 (in nominal terms).  At the same time, 
the GOS decreased the 2004 overall tax and payroll burden to 
30.8 percent, third lowest in the EU (the EU average is 38.8 
percent).  Finally, total state debt should only rise from 
44.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to 45 percent in 2007, well 
below the 60 percent limit required for Euro adoption.  In 
its first year after adopting a 19 percent flat tax rate for 
individuals and corporations, the GOS has greatly improved 
its fiscal health.

SUBJECT: SLOVAKIA ON CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY 
 
REF: STATE 262206 
 
1. (C) Summary. In advance of reftel, poloffs had been 
discussing Cuba policy with a range of GOS and NGO 
interlocutors.  GOS Cuba policy centers on the \"critical 
dialogue\" approach: The GOS must have contact with Cuban 
government officials to be prepared for an inevitable 
democratic transition and to maintain economic and commercial 
ties.  GOS support for this approach has not changed despite 
frozen bilateral relations for over one year and a recent 
highly offensive letter from the Cuban Ambassador to the 
Slovak President of Parliament did much to fuel public 
opinion against the Castro regime.  MFA Interlocutors argued 
that parliamentary leaders and NGOs have greater flexibility 
to support Cuban dissidents more directly.  NGO activities 
include fund raising for the families of Cuban dissidents, 
awareness campaigns, and lobbying the GOS and Members of the 
European Parliament (MEPs).  Leaders in parliament have 
spoken out strongly on human rights conditions in Cuba. End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) Slovaks in both government and the NGO sector have 
been actively promoting human rights and supporting 
dissidents in Cuba for years.  The U.S. can take some credit: 
the same activists that became \"experts\" on democracy through 
SEED funds are now exporting their experience to other 
countries that haven\'t yet made the dramatic leap to 
democracy and free market systems.  However, most of the 
motivation for Slovak policy towards Cuba comes from memories 
of what it was like to live in a repressive regime, and from 
what happens afterwards. 
 
The Government 
-------------- 
 
3. (C) The MFA is feeling pressure from some EU members to 
warm relations with the Castro regime.  On the one hand, the 
GOS wants to support dissidents and democratic transition. 
On the other hand, it knows that even when regimes topple 
overnight, institutions change slowly and bureaucrats remain 
in place.  Current party members may be future democratic 
leaders; take for example Foreign Minister Kukan who studied 
in Moscow and began his diplomatic career as a representative 
of communist Czechoslovakia.  Slovakia also wants to be 
competitive for commercial contracts in Cuba, and believes it 
has a better chance if it has good relations with the current 
regime. 
 
4. (C) Oldrich Hlavacek, Director General of the Fourth 
Territorial Department, and Denisa Juristova, Desk Officer 
for Latin America and the Caribbean, told poloffs December 3 
that the GOS cooperates with the GOC, while at the same time 
encouraging Slovak NGOs to engage Cuban dissidents.  Slovak 
diplomats in Havana and Slovak government officials in 
Bratislava above desk officer level have had no contact with 
the GOC (except through diplomatic notes) since Fall 2003 
when the Slovaks invited Cuban dissidents to an official 
reception.  Hlavacek credited the Spanish initiative to 
weaken the EU\'s restrictive measures on Cuba with prisoner 
releases and warmed Cuban-Spanish relations.  He said the GOS 
cannot leave a \"black hole\" in Cuba by ignoring political 
contacts in the country that will remain as part of the 
bureaucracy after a democratic transition.  A viable dialogue 
is critical to a smooth transition of power. 
 
5. (SBU) Juraj Kubla and Juraj Prituten of the MFA\'s Human 
Rights Department described Cuba policy as primarily driven 
by the common EU position.  Kubla said the GOS supports the 
Honduras resolution and cited President of Parliament Pavol 
Hrusovsky\'s support for the September 19 Cuba conference 
statement in Prague.  (NOTE: Hrusovsky also opened another 
conference on Cuban human rights the following week in 
Bratislava.) Kubla said the department preferred to focus on 
human rights concerns \"closer to home,\" particularly in 
Ukraine and the western Balkans. 
 
6. (C) Hlavacek could not foresee his government lobbying on 
Cuba issues in the UN.  When asked about the influence the 
GOS will wield in 2006/2007 as a non-permanent member of the 
Security Council, Hlavacek replied that the GOS has defined 
the Balkans, Cyprus, the Middle East, and its neighboring 
countries as its priorities for the term. 
 
7. (C) The DCM recently hosted the MFA\'s \"EU team\" for lunch 
and engaged them on maintaining the EU\'s restrictive 
measures.  The EU countries were being handily manipulated by 
the GOC to decrease support for dissidents.  Acting Director 
for European Affairs Fratisek Ruzicka was sympathetic to U.S. 
arguments.  He mentioned that \"playing nice\" to the Castro 
regime has not resulted in any commercial benefits for 
 
Slovakia, and that potential trade should not be the 
motivation for policy in this case.  However, his view may 
not prevail in the MFA. 
 
Parliament: \"Critical\" Dialogue is A Two-Way Street 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
8. (C) President of Parliament Pavol Hrusovsky, also Chair of 
the Christian Democratic Movement and a long-time opponent of 
communism, has been one of the country\'s most outspoken 
public figures on human rights in Cuba (see para 5).  He 
recently sent a letter in support of political prisoner Luis 
Enrique Ferrera Garcia, describing the release of six 
dissidents as a \"necessary, but not sufficient, condition for 
a change in the attitude toward the regime in Cuba.\"  Cuban 
Ambassador to Slovakia Caridad Yamiri Cueto Milian responded 
to Hrusovsky\'s letter in classic fashion.  Her harshly-worded 
letter made headlines with the statement, \"the dignity and 
morals of the Cuban nation stand high above the misery of 
people like you.\"  Op-eds argued that this incident alone was 
excuse enough to oppose the EU policy toward Cuba. 
Nonetheless, Hlavacek said that when FM Eduard Kukan convoked 
the Ambassador to indicate that such language was 
unacceptable, he only discussed diplomatic protocol and did 
not address the substance of the human rights letter that 
sparked the reaction. 
 
9. (U) Another leader in parliament on Cuban human rights is 
Laszlo Nagy of the Hungarian Coalition Party (SMK).  As 
president of the committee on human rights in Parliament, he 
traveled to Cuba last Spring to meet with dissidents with 
other parliamentary leaders from the Czech Republic and 
Sweden.  He felt Cuba had been overshadowed by the events of 
1989, which represented a lost opportunity to influence 
regime change,  He commented that the Cuban dissident 
movement is much more organized than what existed in 1989 in 
the former Czechoslovakia.  He informed poloffs that more 
investment into this group is urgently needed and further 
relaxing the isolation policy would be a clear victory for 
the Castro regime. 
 
NGO Activism 
------------ 
 
10. (SBU) Eliska Slavikova from the NGO People in Peril and 
Milan Nic of Pontis Foundation detailed the activities of 
their organizations in support of Cuban democratization. 
People in Peril focuses on raising public awareness and 
grassroots support, while Pontis has taken a more political 
route.  With support from a 2003 Democracy Commission grant, 
People in Peril organized several music and film festivals 
throughout Slovakia, published newsletters, and hosted 
discussion fora on human rights issues, several specifically 
on Cuba.  The organization collected small donations at these 
events to support the families of Cuban political prisoners. 
People in Peril also encourages the Slovak media to cover 
Cuban issues. 
 
11. (C) Nic described Pontis\' activities to include \"prisoner 
adoptions,\" lobbying the GOS, and supporting Cuban 
dissidents.  The \"prisoner adoption\" scheme asks each 
political party to identify one political prisoner of the 
same party affiliation and coordinate public statements and 
fund raising on that prisoner\'s behalf.  Pontis has asked 
both MPs and MEPs to consider this option.  They have also 
lobbied the GOS to invite dissidents to diplomatic functions 
in Havana and opposed the choice of the new Slovak Ambassador 
to Cuba.  Nic described the new Ambassador as a businessman 
\"not connected with human rights concerns.\"  He noted that 
Slovak trade with Cuba is small.  He claimed a 
non-transparent 400 million USD energy project between the 
politically well-connected Slovak firm SEZ Tlmace and the 
Cuban government is driving the GOS\' Cuba policy.  He also 
said the 15 UN Caribbean votes that Cuba held influence over 
were an important part of Slovakia\'s bid for a 2006/2007 
non-permanent Security Council seat.  (NOTE: Slovakia has 
since won this seat, the top priority of the GOS\' UN policy.) 
 
12. (C) Comment: The GOS Cuba policy is trying to balance 
many interests: human rights and support for dissidents, 
potential to influence a future regime, promotion of 
commercial interests, and being a good EU team player.  The 
gut instinct of Slovakia\'s top leaders is pro-democracy, 
pro-market economy, and pro-reform.  Our challenge remains 
getting that instinct to come out around the tables in 
Brussels.

Sensitive but Unclassified - protect accordingly 
 
1. (U) Summary.  Slovak Deputy PM Pal Csaky and the Council 
of Europe (COE) Commissioner for Human Rights discussed past 
investigations into alleged coerced sterilizations of Roma 
women and the newly approved health care reform package.  The 
Commissioner stressed the need for diligence in strengthening 
all relevant legislation affecting minority groups. 
According to media reports, both officials said they 
considered this case closed.  However, demands from the 
alleged victims for compensation continue, for example in a 
pending court case at the European Court of Human Rights. 
End summary. 
 
2. (U) During a meeting on December 8, Deputy PM for Human 
Rights Pal Csaky and COE Commissioner for Human Rights Alvaro 
Gil-Robles discussed past allegations of coerced 
sterilizations of Roma women. The meeting occurred nearly two 
years after the publication of an NGO report describing over 
two hundred interviews with sterilized Roma women about their 
health care treatment.  Csaky informed Gil-Robles about the 
results of the criminal and government investigations 
conducted and safeguards introduced into the medical system 
to further protect Roma (and all) women.  A COE report issued 
in October 2003 included several recommendations about 
strengthening existing legislation and improving the 
regulations for informed consent.  According to press 
reports, Gil-Robles confirmed he considered the case closed, 
but encouraged diligence in strengthening relevant 
legislation affecting minorities. 
 
3. (SBU) According to Jana Kviecinska, Director of the Human 
Rights Section at the Government Office, Csaky promised to 
meet with the COE after Parliament passed new health care 
reforms (reftel B) to address specific concerns raised in the 
2003 report.  In late September, Parliament adopted six laws 
in order to improve the quality of health care and its 
administration.  Within the broad package of reform, the 
Ministry of Health (MOH) revamped the outdated regulations 
governing sterilization and included a detailed definition of 
informed consent.  The Slovak Family Planning Association and 
the MOH Ethics Committee cooperated in drafting portions of 
the new laws and believe sterilization practices in Slovakia 
will be positively impacted.  The changes to laws covering 
sterilization will become effective January 1, 2005. 
 
4. (SBU) Adriana Lamackova, a Slovak lawyer representing 
women claiming to have undergone coerced sterilization, 
stated the meeting may have been triggered by the submission 
of a new case to the European Court of Human Rights.  The 
Slovak NGO Poradna, which co-authored the controversial 
report, recently submitted a case on the behalf of four Roma 
women.  The case has been accepted by the court, thus the 
government is required to evaluate and provide comments on 
the case\'s merits. 
 
5.  (SBU) Comment:  While the issue may be closed in the 
dialogue between the COE and Slovakia, human rights activists 
continue to pursue cases in court and to open new 
investigations.  The Slovak government appears to be 
cautiously observing the mood in the Czech Republic and the 
GOCR\'s handling of similar allegations that recently emerged 
(reftel A). The pending court cases show that the demand for 
compensation of alleged victims will persist, and the GOS 
will have to deal with the issue for some time to come, case 
closed or not.

TAGS: PGOV, PINR, LO 
SUBJECT: ETHNIC HUNGARIAN AND SLOVAK PARTIES SQUARE OFF 
 
Classified By: DCM Scott N. Thayer for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1. (SBU) Relations between the Hungarian Coalition Party 
(SMK) and the other three parties of the governing coalition 
have suffered due to what many ethnic Slovak politicians see 
as growing radicalism within the SMK.  During the summer, the 
SMK demanded that parliament adopt Hungarian as an official 
language, renewed public discussion about \"autonomy\" for 
parts of southern Slovakia, and pushed for a new Environment 
Fund beyond the control of the Ministry of Finance.  These 
initiatives came against a backdrop of concern among Slovak 
politicians that SMK-led local government decisions 
concerning education and employment were increasingly being 
made according to ethnicity.  Slovak parties decided to 
counter these trends by uniting forces against the SMK in the 
next local elections in certain regions, to which Hungarian 
politicians reacted angrily.  Distrust between the Hungarian 
party and coalition partners will likely increase in the 
lead-up to regional and parliamentary elections. 
Nonetheless, the SMK remains a strong supporter of PM 
Dzurinda\'s reform agenda, and the government will not fall 
over these disagreements.  End Summary. 
 
New Cracks in the Relationship 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) In contrast to the first Dzurinda government 
(1998-2002) when SMK threatened to withdraw from the 
coalition on a number of occasions, the current coalition has 
maintained stable relations.  SMK has defended unpopular 
initiatives from Hungary, such as the Status Law and the 
recent referendum on dual citizenship for all ethnic 
Hungarians, but the GOS overcame these differences of 
opinion.  However, relations between the SMK and other 
government members have become strained along ethnic lines in 
the lead up to regional elections in November 2005. 
 
3. (C) In August, three separate SDKU officials told us that 
the SMK seemed increasingly radical with demands to speak 
Hungarian in Parliament and talk of \"autonomy\" in some 
regions of southern Slovakia.  Tatiana Rosova, Dzurinda\'s 
public opinion advisor, mentioned that the prime minister was 
unhappy about SMK\'s statements, which he believed were 
supported not only by a few outspoken nationalistic 
politicians, but also by SMK Chairman Bela Bugar. (Note: 
According to November polling, Bela Bugar ranked as the third 
most trusted Slovak politician, ahead of all other members of 
the GOS).  Rosova added that the SMK strategically had waited 
until EU entry to launch new initiatives concerning ethnic 
issues.  Kamil Homola, Director of the SDKU\'s central office, 
expressed concern about complaints from ethnic Slovaks in 
mostly-Hungarian villages that SMK has pushed many Slovaks 
out of local positions.  He also confided that SDKU MEPs said 
SMK MEPs were more interested in representing Hungarian 
concerns in Brussels, than in speaking for Slovakia.  SDKU MP 
Tomas Galbavy stated that recent demands went beyond 
acceptable limits.  He added that the SMK is strongly 
influenced by the Hungarian party FIDESZ and its chairman 
Viktor Orban, who encourages ethnic Hungarians to press for 
greater autonomy. 
 
Ganging-Up on Hungarians 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Recently, SDKU started discussions in the Nitra region 
on forming local coalitions, excluding the SMK but leaving 
the door open to other Slovak parties including Vladimir 
Meciar\'s HZDS.  Nitra has one of the largest ethnic Hungarian 
populations.  SMK politicians reacted angrily even though in 
the previous regional elections they ran on a single ticket. 
In 2001, SMK swept four districts in Nitra claiming nearly 60 
percent of the vote.  The three remaining districts went to 
an opposition coalition (HZDS, Smer, SDL, SOP), without a 
single seat gained by other governing coalition parties.  A 
similar situation occurred in Trnava where the SMK won 14 
seats and the Christian Democrats (KDH) received two seats, 
with the remainder of the 40 seats going to a coalition of 
opposition parties.  In the Kosice region, SMK ran with SDKU 
and Smer, and they won the majority of seats.  (Note:  In the 
2001 regional elections, most coalitions at the local level 
were formed independen of national politics based on local 
conditions and personalities.) SMK appealed to coalition 
partners to open negotiations in Nitra, but so far there has 
been no response. 
 
5.   (C) Dzurinda stated that current discussions about 
candidate lists are not meant to \"be against\" any one party, 
but are intended to allow each party to successfully utilize 
its potential in the region.  MP Alexej Ivanko from the 
break-away Freedom Forum confirmed that local coalitions of 
Slovak parties in some regions will likely be formed 
consisting of both governmental and opposition candidates. 
He said Slovak politicians are growing increasingly concerned 
with the SMK monopoly in Nitra and suspect that money is not 
being equitably distributed.  Even some prominent ethnic 
 
Hungarian activists commented that the Hungarian dominance in 
the region has lead to increased cronyism and misconduct. 
 
SMK Hungarian Nationalists Strengthen 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The push by SMK to adopt Hungarian as an official 
language of Parliament created concern not only among Slovak 
coalition members, but also among some SMK members.  SMK MP 
Pal Farkas told poloffs that he was not pleased about the 
ultimate direction of the party after Miklos Duray\'s 
Coexistence faction, formerly a stand-alone Hungarian 
nationalist party before joining the SMK, was significantly 
strengthened in the last party elections.  At the 2003 party 
congress, Duray\'s wing won five of the eight 
vice-chairmanships of the party; both MEPs elected on the SMK 
ticket are Duray supporters.  At a recent party congress, SMK 
leaders decided to ignore party statutes requiring elections 
to replace officers that left for the European Parliament, in 
order not to further strengthen Duray\'s position.  (Comment: 
There is real difference of opinion about the long-term role 
of Coexistence.  Some other SMK members are dismissive, 
portraying its adherents as largely older, rural, and less 
educated, and thus destined for eventual political oblivion. 
Others, however, note that since he is the only senior SMK 
leader without a government position, he has the time and 
ability to act independent politically. He also is the most 
active in trying organize and influence Hungarian youth. End 
Comment.) 
 
7. (C) SMK Chairman Bela Bugar told the Ambassador that the 
rhetoric is just that--mostly superficial.  He reminded the 
Ambassador that the SMK is also a coalition party, with three 
wings that he must hold together.  Therefore, he must do lip 
service to some of the more extreme views.  (Comment: United, 
the SMK wins a steady 10-11 percent of the vote.  If it were 
to split, there might not be any Hungarians in government 
because the micro-parties probably would not obtain the 
required 5 percent minimum. End comment.) 
 
New Ministry Environment Fund Criticized 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) In October, SMK Environmental Minister Laszlo Miklos 
proposed creating an off-budget fund for environmental 
projects to distribute approximately one billion SKK (33 
million USD).  Coalition parties opposed the idea, saying 
that the fund would be ineligible for audit, which sets a 
dangerous precedent and is not transparent.  SMK overturned a 
presidential veto of the law creating the new fund with the 
support of opposition parties, which was the first time SMK 
lobbied across the aisle.  Observers predict that this new 
fund will be the SMK \"cash cow\" used to pay for favors and 
finance election campaigns. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (SBU)  SMK has been a reliable partner in the governing 
coalition.  Bela Bugar has openly criticized PM Dzurinda\'s 
leadership style, and even suggested he resign after Ivan 
Simko resigned from the SDKU with several other MP\'s, but the 
personality conflicts did not hinder the government\'s reform 
program.  As Slovakia enters the pre-election period 
(regional elections are scheduled for November 2005 and 
national elections for November 2006), the SMK is focused on 
its own political agenda and on rewarding supporters.  The 
ongoing debates on minority issues, especially the December 5 
referendum in Hungary on dual citizenship for all ethnic 
Hungarians, are likely to energize voters and further 
strengthen the nationalist wing in SMK.  Thus there will be a 
multi-layerd relationship between the \"Slovak\" coalition 
parties and the SMK.  They will cooperate on a national 
agenda while competing for electoral seats at the local 
level, and will keep a careful watch on SMK management of the 
Environment and Construction Ministries that control generous 
resources from EU funds.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/17/2024 
TAGS: PREL, ECON, LO 
SUBJECT: AS I DEPART SLOVAKIA 
 
 
Classified By: AMB RONALD WEISER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (U) Mr. Secretary, 
 
As I prepare to leave Slovakia, I want to thank you for the 
opportunity to serve as Ambassador and look ahead briefly to 
the future of U.S. relations with Slovakia. 
 
WHERE WE ARE 
------------ 
 
2. (C) When I arrived in Slovakia in November 2001, we faced 
the very real possibility of a return to power of the 
autocratic and corrupt former Prime Minister, Vladimir 
Meciar.  However, by working with our European allies and the 
NGO community, we encouraged high voter turnout.  This 
enabled remnants of the existing pro-democracy ruling 
coalition to form a new center-right coalition with Mikulas 
Dzurinda returning as Prime Minister.  This was the first 
time that a reform government was able to win re-election in 
Central Europe.  The GOS has been able to successfully adopt 
its package of western oriented reforms and Prime Minister 
Dzurinda should have no difficulty serving out his term. 
 
3. (C) Slovakia has been called an investor\'s paradise and it 
is now poised to become a regional economic power, especially 
in the automotive industry.  Reforms have made Slovakia an 
economic success story and captured the attention of 
policymakers and businesspeople around the world.  Cumulative 
foreign direct investment has doubled in the past three years 
and American companies are the third largest investors.  U.S. 
Steel\'s Kosice operation is the largest economic force in 
Slovakia and the well-regarded company won your 2003 Award 
for Corporate Excellence.  The recent announcement of a half 
billion dollar Ford investment, coupled with several other 
American companies already in or soon to come to Eastern 
Slovakia, means the U.S. has a disproportionately large and 
positive presence in this economically depressed region.  Our 
very strong economic ties will help balance EU influence and 
provide a sturdy framework for our overall relationship for 
many years to come. 
 
4.  (C) Slovakia\'s deployments to OIF, OEF, and Kosovo 
underscore its commitment to the war on terror.  Slovakia has 
been the world leader per-capita in supplying troops to 
peacekeeping missions around the globe and is shifting away 
from UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs) towards NATO-, EU-, 
and U.S.-led operations.  This is an expensive decision, 
because UN PKOs are often reimbursable, but we support this 
shift because it more effectively supports U.S. interests. 
Parliament and the GOS are supportive of defense reforms 
sought by NATO that call for a smaller, more deployable 
military to meet NATO standards.  Robust levels of FMF and 
IMET (in contrast to the reduced levels of the past two 
years) will be required to continue modernization and prevent 
the operational costs of the deployments we seek from 
providing an excuse for those who wish to derail the reform 
effort. 
 
5. (C) Slovakia\'s transition to a diverse, multicultural 
society is not complete.  The GOS has made efforts to improve 
the lives of its Roma population living in poverty, but 
progress has been slow and a comprehensive solution will 
likely require the EU to take a major role (which it has been 
reluctant to do).  Anti-Semitism and xenophobia still persist 
in certain elements of Slovak society, although repudiated by 
mainstream politicians.  The GOS has a good record of 
addressing the law enforcement aspects of the trafficking 
issue; since neither it nor NGOs have been able to identify 
significant numbers of victims, programs of prevention and 
protection are not as developed as in neighboring countries. 
Corruption continues to be a problem throughout Slovakia and 
the broad immunity from conflict of interest and financial 
disclosure laws which MPs and judges enjoy exacerbates the 
problem.  Nevertheless, economic growth and increased western 
investment have brought with them higher business standards 
and the level of corruption appears to have diminished over 
the last several years. 
 
THE CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Since 1998, the twin goals of NATO and EU membership 
have been the focal points of the Slovak government and 
people.  They enjoyed broad support across the political 
spectrum and were the locomotive of reform.  The political 
leadership of the country has not come to terms with what it 
wants to accomplish as a member of these institutions over 
the long haul.  Combined with a national character that tends 
to view Slovakia and Slovaks as underdogs, this has meant 
 
that Slovakia is hesitant to take a forceful role in most 
NATO and EU discussions.  Slovak views are reflexively 
transatlantic and the U.S. is still viewed as the beacon of 
hope that never dimmed during the Communist era.  We are thus 
in a unique position to encourage some national introspection 
and guide the Slovaks to full-fledged membership of NATO and 
the EU, in support of U.S. interests. 
 
7.  (C) The 2006 elections present a new challenge for the 
GOS, and the U.S.  Robert Fico appears to have succeeded in 
consolidating the left parties, and his SMER party 
consistently leads the polls.  He continues to defy attempts 
to categorize him politically, and eschews concrete policy 
positions in favor of \"by-the-poll-numbers\" populism.  The 
GOS has the opportunity to counter this if the reforms 
produce noticeable improvements in quality of life over the 
next two years. 
 
8.  (C) It is clear that the Embassy must actively engage the 
Slovak public to help them understand what the U.S. -- and 
U.S. policy -- are really all about.  A major factor in 
Slovak perceptions of the United States will be the degree to 
which Slovaks believe we are being responsive to their 
concerns regarding U.S. visa policy.  Within the contraints 
of current policy the Embassy must step up its efforts to 
encourage Slovak travel to the U.S. and to counter the urban 
legends surrounding the \"visa issue\".  This can reduce the 
problem but only a change in policy will fix it. 
 
9.  (C)  This Embassy has received sorely-needed positions 
due to your Diplomatic Readiness Initiative.  This must be 
teamed up with increased funding for security assistance, for 
public outreach, for exchanges, and for small grants if we 
are to preserve our position and advance our agenda. 
 
THE FOREIGN SERVICE 
------------------- 
 
10.  (U) I would like to highlight the excellent work 
conducted by post\'s talented group of Foreign Service 
officers, specialists and nationals.  When I arrived here I 
expected to find bureaucrats who were entrenched in an 
unwieldy system of government inefficiency.  Instead, I found 
a group of talented and motivated individuals who were 
dedicated to their work of carrying out the President\'s 
foreign policy objectives.  It has been a privilege and an 
honor to work with these people, who have allowed us to 
accomplish much during my three very rewarding years as 
Ambassador to the Slovak Republic.

REF: STATE 248987 
 
SUMMARY/OVERVIEW 
---------------- 
1. SLOVAKIA LIES AT THE CROSSROADS OF TWO MAJOR DRUG TRANSIT 
ROUTES, THE TRADITIONAL EAST-WEST ROUTES FROM UKRAINE AND 
THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE HISTORIC \"BALKAN ROUTE,\" 
WHICH RUNS FROM SOUTHWEST ASIA TO TURKEY AND ON TO GERMANY, 
FRANCE, AND OTHER WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE GOS IS A 
PARTY TO THE 1988 UN DRUG CONVENTION. END SUMMARY. 
 
STATUS OF COUNTRY 
-------------------- 
2. LEVELS OF BOTH CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION OF NARCOTICS IN 
SLOVAKIA REMAIN RELATIVELY LOW, HOWEVER, IT HAS A FULLY 
DEVELOPED DOMESTIC MARKET FOR NARCOTICS. DEMAND FOR 
STIMULANTS, MAINLY PERVITIN AND ECSTASY, IS RAPIDLY GROWING, 
AND THEIR USE, ALONG WITH THAT OF MARIJUANA, IS QUICKLY 
SPREADING INTO SMALLER SLOVAK TOWNS. 
 
3. THE GOS REMAINS CONCERNED THAT SLOVAKIA IS A 
TRANSSHIPMENT POINT FOR SMUGGLED DRUGS AND CONCENTRATES ITS 
INTERDICTION EFFORTS ON EAST-WEST SMUGGLING FROM UKRAINE AND 
RUSSIA. RUSSIAN ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS TRAFFIC AFGHAN HEROIN 
AND PEACEFULLY COOPERATE WITH THE ESTABLISHED ALBANIAN 
CRIMINAL GROUPS USING THE BALKAN ROUTE. THE ALBANIAN 
COMMUNITY IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE HEROIN TRADE IN THE 
REGION, AND THEY MAINLY USE THE SOUTHERN BALKAN ROUTE 
THROUGH BULGARIA AND CROATIA. 
 
4. EU ACCESSION AND MORE OPEN BORDERS HAVE CREATED 
CONDITIONS FOR DRUG-RELATED ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS TO TAKE 
ROOT IN SLOVAKIA, AND MOST OF THEM ARE BASED ON ETHNIC 
PRINCIPLES. STREET SALES HAVE NOT TAKEN ROOT IN SLOVAKIA, 
AND THE ROMA COMMUNITY DOMINATES DOMESTIC DRUG DISTRIBUTION 
BY SELLING DRUGS FROM THEIR HOMES.  ALBANIAN GROUPS SUPPLY 
THE ROMA SELLERS. 
 
COUNTRY ACTIONS AGAINST DRUGS IN 2004 
-------------------------------------- 
5. POLICY INITIATIVES: THE NATIONAL PLAN FOR THE FIGHT 
AGAINST DRUGS WAS REVISED FOR 2004-2008 AND REPRESENTS A 
COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO REDUCE DRUG USE. THE GOS ALSO 
ESTABLISHED A MINISTERIAL COUNCIL FOR DRUG DEPENDENCIES AND 
DRUG CONTROL, WHICH IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON EDUCATION AND 
PREVENTION. LAW ENFORCEMENT MINISTRIES PARTICIPATE AND 
IMPLEMENT THEIR PARTS OF THE PLAN INDEPENDENTLY. 
 
6. ACCOMPLISHMENTS: IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2004, THERE WERE 
597 DRUG-RELATED CRIMINAL CASES IN SLOVAKIA. THE NUMBER OF 
CASES INVOLVING SYNTHETIC NARCOTICS INCREASED 42.67 PERCENT 
COMPARED WITH THE FIRST HALF OF 2003, AND THE SHARE OF 
SYNTHETIC DRUGS IN OVERALL DRUG-RELATED CRIMES WAS 28.6 
PERCENT, UP FROM 19.2 PERCENT IN 2003. METHAMPHETAMINES 
(PRECURSOR TO PERVITIN) ACCOUNTED FOR MUCH OF THE INCREASE. 
THE NATIONAL ANTI-DRUG UNIT (NADU) INVESTIGATED 18 CASES IN 
BRATISLAVA AND 23 CASES IN OTHER REGIONS, REPRESENTING A 29 
PERCENT DECREASE FROM 2003. 
 
7. LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS: THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR (MOI) 
UNDERWENT COMPREHENSIVE ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING IN 
2004. THE CRIMINAL AND FINANCIAL POLICE, IN WHICH THE NADU 
IS LOCATED, MERGED WITH THE MOI\'S SECURITY POLICE. SLOVAK 
AUTHORITIES HOPE THE RESTRUCTURING WILL FACILITATE BETTER 
COMMUNICATION AND SHORTEN INVESTIGATIONS. A SPECIALIZED 
POLICE AGENCY TARGETING ORGANIZED CRIME IS ALSO PART OF THE 
REORGANIZATION. IN THIS RE-ORGANIZATION, THE NADU LOST SOME 
OF ITS AUTHORITY AND IS RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR THE BRATISLAVA 
REGION AS A PART OF THE OFFICE FOR FIGHTING ORGANIZED CRIME 
(OFOC). OTHER REGIONAL ANTI-DRUG UNITS HAVE BEEN 
INCORPORATED INTO THE OFOC, BUT THEY DO NOT COMMUNICATE WITH 
THE NADU. CONTRARY TO THE 2000 GOS\' RESOLUTION THAT CALLED 
FOR AN INCREASE IN THE NADU\'S STAFF FROM 150 TO 250 
PERSONNEL, THE MOI DOWNSIZED THE UNIT TO 35 PEOPLE WHEN THE 
MOI MADE IT RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR THE BRATISLAVA REGION. 
 
8. CORRUPTION: SLOVAKIA HAS MADE MAJOR LEGISLATIVE STRIDES 
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION. OFFICIALS SERIOUS ABOUT 
CREATING TRANSPARENT RULES AND PROSECUTING ABUSES HAVE BEEN 
PUT IN KEY POSITIONS, A NEW CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAW PASSED 
IN 2004, AND A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND COURT TO FIGHT 
CORRUPTION WERE INSTITUTED. THE HEAD OF THE GOS\' ANTI- 
CORRUPTION OFFICE IS A NOTED HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER WHO 
LIBERALIZED THE USE OF \"STING\" OPERATIONS AND INTRODUCED A 
\"WHISTLE BLOWER\" STATUTE TO PROTECT GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WHO 
TALK TO INVESTIGATORS ABOUT CORRUPTION IN THEIR OFFICES. 
SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THESE MEASURES PUT IN PLACE REMAINS 
A CHALLENGE. 
 
9. AGREEMENTS OR TREATIES: SLOVAKIA IS A PARTY TO THE 1988 
UN DRUG CONVENTION, THE 1961 UN SINGLE CONVENTION ON 
 
 
NARCOTIC DRUGS, THE 1972 PROTOCOL AMENDING THE SINGLE 
CONVENTION, AND THE 1971 UN CONVENTION ON PSYCHOTROPIC 
SUBSTANCES. THE EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
AND THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTINUED IN FORCE BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND SLOVAKIA. SLOVAKIA HAS RATIFIED THE UN 
CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME AND HAS 
SIGNED THE PROTOCOL TO PREVENT, SUPPRESS AND PUNISH 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS AS WELL AS THE PROTOCOL AGAINST THE 
SMUGGLING OF MIGRANTS. 
 
10. CULTIVATION/PRODUCTION: THE NADU REPORTS THAT MARIJUANA 
CULTIVATION HAS INCREASED IN ALL REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND 
SEVERAL GROUPS ARE GROWING HIGH-QUALITY MARIJUANA IN 
LABORATORY CONDITIONS.  HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF MARIJUANA 
USED IN SLOVAKIA IS STILL IMPORTED FROM MOROCCO, LEBANON, 
INDIA, PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN. IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT 
HEROIN IS BEING PRODUCED IN SLOVAKIA. SLOVAK MDMA (ECSTASY) 
USE HAS INCREASED, ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN FEW REPORTS OF 
ITS PRODUCTION WITHIN THE COUNTRY. ON THE OTHER HAND, 
PERVITIN IS PRODUCED FOR MAINLY DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION, AND 
CZECH \"EXPERTS\" ARE HIRED AND CONSULTED ON PRODUCTION 
METHODS. IN RECENT YEARS, POLICE HAVE DISCOVERED 20 TO 30 
SYNTHETIC DRUG LABORATORIES ANNUALLY. 
 
11. DRUG FLOW/TRANSIT: THE SHARED BORDER WITH HUNGARY AND 
UKRAINE WAS THE SITE OF THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS TO 
ENTER SLOVAKIA WITH ILLEGAL NARCOTICS. THE GREATEST NUMBER 
OF ATTEMPTS TO SMUGGLE DRUGS OUT OF SLOVAKIA HAPPENED AT THE 
CZECH AND AUSTRIAN BORDERS. 
 
12. DOMESTIC PROGRAMS: ACCORDING TO THE 2003 MINI-DUBLIN 
GROUP REPORT, THE GOS IS AMONG THE HIGHEST SPENDERS ON 
PREVENTATIVE ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO PER CAPITA GNP. 
CENTERS FOR EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PREVENTION FOCUS ON 
COMMUNITY OUTREACH CONCERNING DRUG USE AND FUNCTION IN HALF 
OF THE MUNICIPAL DISTRICTS OF SLOVAKIA. THE SLOVAK 
HEALTHCARE SERVICE HAS A COMPREHENSIVE NETWORK ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY AND OFFERS SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TREATMENT. 
 
U.S. POLICY INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS 
---------------------------------------- 
13. BILATERAL COOPERATION: AS IN PRIOR YEARS, SLOVAK LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE COURSES, FUNDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE. THE 
CLASSES WERE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THE RESISTANCE TO 
CORRUPTIVE INFLUENCES AT THE WORKING LEVEL AND TO IMPROVE 
COUNTER-NARCOTICS AND ORGANIZED CRIME 
DETECTION/INVESTIGATIVE SKILLS. POST\'S EXPORT CONTROL AND 
BORDER SECURITY PROGRAM PROVIDED NUMEROUS TRAINING 
OPPORTUNITIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR SLOVAK CUSTOMS OFFICERS. THE 
TWO MOST EFFECTIVE TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE THE FOUR WEEKS OF 
JOINT TRAINING WITH CZECH OFFICERS ON THE CZECH-SLOVAK 
BORDER AND A SIMILAR PROGRAM ON THE SLOVAK-UKRAINIAN BORDER. 
 
14. THE ROAD AHEAD: THE USG WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE 
GOS TO ADEQUATELY BUDGET FOR NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT AND TO 
MAINTAIN ITS TOUGH STANCE ON DRUG INTERDICTION.

Presidents Bush and Putin: In February, Bratislava will 
become the center of the world for one day, PM Mikulas 
Dzurinda announced, noting that on February 24, Russian 
President Vladimir Putin will meet his US counterpart 
George Bush in Bratislava. \"It will be a big day for 
the Slovak people and the Slovak nation, and allow me 
to express some sentiment, also for me personally,\" 
said PM Dzurinda, remarking on his personal 
relationship with President Bush, \"I very honestly 
appreciate the friendship I feel on his part.\"  On PAGE 
2:The daily suggests that for Slovakia, organizing such 
a meeting will be a great challenge, adding that 
President Bush will visit Europe in order to fix 
mutually complicated relations with the continent. Head 
of the unit for protecting state officials Jan Packa 
said that measures Bratislava has never seen before 
will be taken. On PAGE 2 SME also prints a summary of 
previous summits between the Russian and US presidents, 
and features Dzurinda\'s comment that the summit is \"a

disinformation spread by the opposition saying that 
Dzurinda turned Slovakia into an island of US

last meeting in Chile in November 2004: \"Vladimir Putin 
is going to meet with George Bush in the capital of 
Slovakia\" - said a spokesperson from Kremel Alexej 
Gromov according to agency ITAR TASS. Bush will fly in 
for two days on February 23. This day will be 
considered as official visit to Slovakia. The press 
section of the Russian Embassy said \"at this moment we 
have no information\". Spokesperson of the Slovak 
Ministry of the Foreign Affaires, Juraj Tomaga: \"I am 
not going to comment on this\". As a first official 
commenting on this information, Minister of Foreign 
Affaires Eduard Kukan said: \"It is a signal of 
appreciation and trust that we can organize this kind 
of meeting\". According to theRussian news portal 
Bratislava was chosen during the summit in Chile in 
November. Bush is also supposed to meet Putin in May in 
Moscow to celebrate 60th anniversary of the Nazi 
defeat. 
PAGE 10:\"Honor for Slovakia\" - a byliner by Miroslav 
Caplovic comments on the upcoming summit of bosses from 
the White House and Kremlin. Why did they choose 
Bratislava? George Bush considers Slovakia as his 
faithful ally, but he has never stopped here on his way 
to Europe. It is about time to see his NATO newcomer. 
Also Vladimir Putin has had his invitation from 
Gasparovic\' predecessor Rudolf Schuster on his desk for 
a long time. Their visits belong to visits requiring 
the highest security so we think that we have a good 
reputation in this regard. Slovakia managed to secure 
the pope and even the NATO Summit took place without 
massive protests. 
 
DAILY NARODNA OBRODA, PAGE 1:\"Bush and Putin are going 
to meet in Bratislava in February\": President Ivan 
Gasparovic says that US President George Bush will not 
come to Bratislava because of Russian President 
Vladimir Putin, but because Slovakia is a country with 
the right reactions to international issues. He 
considers it important that both state officials have 
accepted Slovakia\'s invitation. The daily quotes Charge 
d\'Affaires Scott Thayer as saying that President Bush 
comes to Bratislava as a friend of Slovakia.  PAGE 
2:\"Bratislava is neutral\": Sarah E. Mendelson of the 
American Center for Strategic and International Studies 
said that American and Russian representatives chose 
Bratislava because it is a neutral place for the 
meeting. \"They probably were seeking something between 
the US and Russia. It could not have been the Baltic 
countries or Poland and certainly not Ukraine or 
Belarus,\" she said.  Prague would have evoked memories 
of 1968.

President Bush\'s visit to Bratislava in February next 
year where the meeting with Russian President Putin 
will take place. 
 
TV MARKIZA, TV News: In February next year a Russian-US 
summit will take place in Bratislava. We were first 
informed about this event by the Russian side, then 
Eduard Kukan (Minister of Foreign Affairs) confirmed it 
and then the U.S. Embassy in Slovakia. This will be the 
first visit of a US president to Slovakia. The summit 
will take place on Feb 24, but Bush may arrive on the 
23rd. During his trip to Europe he will visit Berlin 
and Brussels too. This Russian - U.S summit is by far 
the most important political event that has ever taken 
place in Slovakia. PM Mikulas Dzurinda: This bilateral 
meeting is taking place in our country, this is a big 
day for us, we are happy. Charge d\'Affaires, Scott 
Thayer: President Bush will come as a friend of 
Slovakia and PM. Slovak President, Ivan Gasparovic: It 
means so much for us, also from the economic point of 
view, it\'s the way to show trust to our country. 
 
SLOVAK TV: In February Putin and Bush are meeting in 
Bratislava, as announced by the Kremlin. This is the 
first visit of a US President to our country. 
Politicians agreed on this meeting in Bratislava ten 
days ago. Bush will also visit Belgium and Germany. PM 
Mikulas Dzurinda: This is wonderful for Slovakia to 
participate in bilateral talks and to be a host country 
of such an event. Slovak President, Ivan Gasparovic: 
This confirms that we are a trustworthy country. 
 
TV TA3: US President Bush will come February 23-24, as

is so wonderful for Slovakia that it will participate 
in bilateral talks and be a host country of such an 
event. It also shows the great relationship between US 
and Slovakia. Slovak President: President Bush is 
coming primarily to visit Slovakia. Slovak MFA Eduard 
Kukan, President: The Russian - US summit was not our 
initiative. Before they met in Slovenia, so this is a 
natural process; they choose neutral countries.

REF:  STATE 259043 
 
1.  Per reftel, On December 7 Econoff delivered questions 
about the EU\'s battery directive to Peter Gallovic, Director 
of Waste Management at the Ministry of Environment.  On 
December 21, Gallovic reported that the GOS supports the new 
proposal of the Council Chairmanship to introduce a partial 
ban of cadmium in batteries.  They further agree with the 
proposed ban of batteries that contain more than 0.0005 
percent of their weight in mercury.  Slovakia does not have 
a special collection system in place for portable batteries, 
though the law does state that they must be separated from 
normal household trash. 
 
2.  The GOS supports the proposal to set the collection 
limits at 20 percent after four years and 35 or 40 percent 
after seven years.  Conversely, the GOS does not support the 
proposal to incorporate long-term collection targets at the 
10 year mark.  As for financing the collection, Gallovic 
stated that they support paragraph 20 of the current 
proposal which stipulates that third parties would cover all 
costs associated with collection, administration, and 
recycling of batteries.  Finally, the GOS has not performed 
any local impact studies.

1.  (U) Summary.  On November 19, 2004 hurricane force winds 
devastated the forests of Slovakia\'s mountainous High Tatras 
region.  As a result, nearly all the trees were uprooted in a 
forested area over 240 square kilometers in size.  Slovaks 
were deeply affected by the disaster as the Tatras are the 
region,s main tourist attraction and are considered by many 
as a unique cultural heritage site and the pride of the 
nation.  The GOS responded quickly, forming a commission to 
address the cleanup and redevelopment of the region, but 
details of their plans have been slow to emerge.  Now, 
questions have arisen about what redevelopment would mean to 
the High Tatras.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) Following the natural calamity, Prime Minister 
Mikulas Dzurinda called for swift action and established a 
Cabinet Commission (CC) responsible for &coordination, 
renewal, and development works in the High Tatras.8   The CC 
consists of high-level government officials including 
Dzurinda; Pavol Rusko, Minister of Economy; Laszlo Miklos, 
Minister of Environment; Zsolt Simon, Minister of 
Agriculture; as well as the Ministers of Finance, Foreign 
Affairs, Interior, and Labor, plus representation from the 
two largest opposition parties in parliament, HZDS and Smer. 
In fact, the only working level participants on the CC in its 
current incarnation are a local mayor and a city manager. 
The CC held its first official meeting December 13, 2004 and 
named Ivan Stefanec, head of Coca Cola in Slovakia, as the 
acting Executive Secretary.  (Comment: Stefanec is close 
colleague of Dzurinda and was his unsuccessful candidate to 
be Slovakia\'s first EU Commissioner.)  Other work at the 
meeting included the creation of a &roadmap8 for the 
removal of the fallen trees, valued at USD 136 million. 
 
3.  (U) Ever since the catastrophe, however, there has been 
media speculation that &the real ecological disaster is 
still coming8, expressing the fear that the GOS would take 
advantage of the disaster and convert the previously 
preserved land into large-scale tourist resorts.  Much of the 
concern was fueled by comments from Rusko such as, 
&protectionism should stop and modernization begin8 in the 
Tatras.  Dzurinda, though more diplomatic, also expressed a 
desire to turn the tragedy into an economic positive and 
foster growth in the region.  Only Miklos cautioned that 
redevelopment would only be done to existing tourist sites 
and that, &ski resorts would not replace the forests.\"  On 
December 9, in a televised debate between various NGOs, 
forestry experts, and Simon, he stated that a working group 
of experts had already prepared plans of how, when, and where 
to begin redevelopment though specific details have yet to be 
announced. 
 
4.  (U) NGOs have consistently criticized the CC for not 
including a wider array of entities in the decision making 
process.  Over 70 NGOs signed a petition seeking 
participatory representation in the CC to ensure that all 
opinions are considered.  In the aforementioned debate, 
representatives from the NGOs Vlk (wolf) and Ekopolis pleaded 
for more discussions before any actions are taken.  Simon, 
however, was unable to provide any reasonable argument for 
the exclusion of NGOs or other independent experts.  NGOs 
additionally cite the naming of Stefanec as Committee 
Secretary as further evidence of the influence of big 
 
SIPDIS 
business on the CC. 
5.  (U) NGOs, Slovak celebrities and other concerned citizens 
have since formed a new coalition called &Our Tatras8 which 
seeks a larger voice in the forest renewal discussions. 
Econoff spoke with Boris Strecansky, Program Director of 
Ekopolis, and one of the leaders of the new citizens 
association.  Strecansky stated that the clean up process was 
proceeding efficiently with no major problems.  He further 
explained that Our Tatras does not advocate any particular 
approach to renovating the damaged forests, but simply wants 
to ensure that the process is transparent and that all due 
diligence is performed by qualified experts.  The group is 
concerned that the emotional response of the nation to the 
disaster, spurred the GOS to &do something8 without 
allowing time for reasonable actions or plans to be devised. 
Strecansky did admit, however, that Dzurinda has recently 
revealed a greater willingness to permit a wider range of 
participation in the Tatras renewal. 
 
6.  (SBU) In conversations with Econoffs, business leaders 
have questioned the likelihood of Rusko,s vision of 
 
large-scale commercialization in the High Tatras.  Services 
and infrastructure, especially highways, are still limited 
and, therefore, unlikely to pull tourists away from modern 
facilities in the Alps.  In addition, financial institutions 
are aware of these issues and not apt to provide the 
necessary capital for new projects in the region.  Strecansky 
agreed, in general, but warned that some new development was 
still possible and that the most protected and sensitive 
areas in the Tatras, are also the most desirable from the 
market,s perspective.  He further opined that Rusko is well 
aware of the region\'s limitations and is merely attempting to 
incite financial speculation thereby raising the real estate 
values in the Tatras.  Though choosing not to state it 
directly, Strencansky implied that Rusko would personally 
profit from the rising prices. 
 
7.  (U) In reftel, post requested information for a DVC 
conference between GOS and USG officials to share experiences 
and suggestions.  We now request an update on the status of 
USG speakers for such an event.  Strecansky was very 
optimistic about NGO participation in such an event and 
specifically requested topics that could help the GOS 
establish a framework to deal with environmental disasters in 
a systematic and transparent manner.

HZDS Considering Troop Increase for Iraq? 
------------------------------------------ 
1. (C) Michaela Blanarova, Assistant to HZDS Deputy Chairman 
and Deputy Speaker of Parliament Viliam Veteska and HZDS 
Foreign Policy Advisor, told emboffs December 16 that Veteska 
is considering proposing an increase in the number of Slovak 
deminers in Iraq.  She did not have any further details and 
noted Veteska has not thoroughly discussed this proposal 
within his party and not at all outside of the party.  The 
current idea is to increase the Slovak contribution to OIF, 
not the NATO training mission.  (COMMENT: We are cautiously 
optimistic about this claim.  HZDS has liberalized since the 
Meciar-era when the party was characterized by its double 
speak.  Emboffs noticed Blanarova seemed keen on telling us 
what we wanted to hear.  Working from talking points, 
Blanarova only mentioned this idea off the cuff near the end 
of the meeting.  Such a HZDS proposal would be completely out 
of line with the party\'s political base.  END COMMENT.) 
 
Possibile New Extradition Treaty 
-------------------------------- 
2. (C) During a farewell call on Justice Minister Daniel 
Lipsic, the Ambassador expressed hope that a new bilateral 
extradition treaty would allow for the extradition of Slovak 
nationals to the U.S., even if it was conditioned as in other 
EU countries.  Lipsic replied that he had no objection to the 
idea.  (Comment: This is in contrast to what we have heard 
from working-level contacts at the MOJ, who said that 
extraditing nationals to the U.S. would be politically very 
difficult for Slovakia.)  In its first extradition ever of 
nationals, the GOS handed over two Slovaks to Austrian 
authorities in early December to stand trial on murder 
charges.  We have delivered the proposed text for a new 
extradition treaty (ref A). 
 
Labor Minister Kanik Survives No-Confidence Vote 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
3. (U) Ludovit Kanik, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, 
survived a vote of no confidence on December 14.  Of the 134 
MPs present, 66 voted in favor, 64 against, three officially 
abstained, and one did not vote.  The vote required a 
parliamentary majority of 76 votes.  The strongest opposition 
party SMER proposed the motion, arguing that Kanik is 
politically responsible for the mismanaged pension reform, 
which will require citizens to deposit their money in private 
investments without a guaranteed yield.  SMER also criticized 
Kanik for abuse of office. Kanik asked the Social Insurance 
Company to pardon his firm\'s penalties for not paying social 
insurance benefits to his employees between 1997 and 2001. 
SMER\'s initiative was supported by HZDS and the Free Forum. 
Subsequently, parliament passed a proposal binding the GOS to 
provide full information to citizens about possible risks 
they face when entering the capitalization stage of the 
pension system.

The first set of files made public are from Kosice, the StB

on-line. The media have reported everyday about current 
public figures who have records of collaborating with the 
StB, including some high-level officials from governing 
coalition parties. 
 
5. (U) Emboffs toured the archives and saw the future reading 
room where researchers and ordinary citizens will have access 
to the original files.  Emboffs observed the high-tech but 
labor-intensive process of digitizing the paper and 
microfiche files and editing the electronic version to remove 
data about innocent third parties and personal information 
such as birth dates health status, and home addresses. 
Langos\' dedication to sharing information about how the 
 
communist regime spied on its own population has not abated, 
despite physical attacks on him and his wife (ref B) and 
continuous threats from anonymous letter writers. 
 
6. (U) Langos said the 2005 state budget would not cut the 
Institute\'s funds for the coming year, nor would it increase 
them for research and publication activities, which the law 
mandates they carry out.  The organization will be able to 
continue its work at current levels. 
 
World War II-era Restitution 
---------------------------- 
7. (U) Langos mentioned that the Institute for the Memory of 
the Nation is charged with opening secret files from the 
communist regime and the war-time Slovak state that 
collaborated with the Nazis.  There are detailed accounts of 
activities from the World War II period, including lists of 
property confiscations.  (Comment: We are not optimistic 
regarding the contribution these archives might make to 
restitution cases.  The Jewish Community already searched the 
National archives to compile information for restitution 
claims.  In addition, the restitution bill being re-worked in 
parliament concerns only agricultural lands and buildings 
located on these lands; it was mainly drafted to satisfy the 
needs of Catholic church which owned farms and other real 
estate in the past that have not yet been returned.  Jewish 
Community representatives say the legislation concerns their 
community only marginally.  End comment.) 
 
Foreign Policy Debate 
--------------------- 
8. (U) On Decembar 10, two elite panels from the Slovak 
foreign policy establishment discussed the guiding principles 
of Slovak foreign policy.  Jozef Banas, SDKU MP, defined the 
debate as a question of values versus pragmatism and argued 
for a pragmatic foreign policy.  He advocated more active 
Slovak participation in NATO and said Slovak foreign policy 
debates requires greater research and substance.  Major print 
and broadcast media representatives agreed, saying they do 
not report on global issues because politicians and think 
tanks refuse to comment on these issues.  NGO representatives 
present cited the lack of grants available to fund research 
to form intelligent opinions. 
 
9. (U) Urban Rusnak, author of the MFA\'s \"Mid-Term Strategy 
for Foreign Policy until 2015,\" argued for a moral-pragmatic 
balance in foreign policy, saying the GOS should focus on two 
to three priorities -- Ukraine, the western Balkans, and 
perhaps Russia.  Rusnak and Banas agreed that the GOS should 
prepare opinions only on matters of immediate interest due to 
limited resources.  Milan Nic of the Pontis Foundation said 
the GOS should formulate positions on all EU debates, as the 
unanimous voting mechanism gives the GOS a veto. 
 
10. (U) Martin Butora, former Slovak Ambassador to the U.S. 
and president of the Institute for Public Affairs, argued 
Slovakia must develop an institutional capacity to contribute 
to foreign policy debates, especially on human rights and 
democracy issues.  He denied the competition between a 
values-based and pragmatic strategic outlook, noting that 
democracy and human rights promotion has economic and 
commercial advantages as proven over the past fifteen years 
by the Visegrad-4 countries.  Butora said a Slovak 
institution like the Helsinki Commission with governmental 
support but an independent character would build the 
institutional capacity necessary to support democracy and 
civil society abroad. 
 
Ambassador Raises TIP with Justice Minister 
------------------------------------------ 
11. (C) During a farewell call on Justice Minister Daniel 
Lipsic, the Ambassador raised the need for a national action 
plan against trafficking in persons.  Lipsic described some 
of the measures his ministry has taken to combat TIP, 
including raising penalties for trafficking children. 
Further details to follow septel.

E.O. 12958: N/A

SUBJECT:  THIRD QUARTER REVIEW OF THE SLOVAK ECONOMY 
 
1.  Summary. Slovak economic growth slowed slightly to 5.3 
percent in the third quarter of 2004, but still outpaced its 
Central European neighbors.  Higher investments and household 
consumption replaced exports as the main economic catalyst. 
Growth should remain strong with inflow of foreign direct 
investment (FDI) continuing to gain momentum and new auto makers 
boosting the supply capacity of the economy.  In addition, rising 
wage forecasts and GOS spending plans should accelerate domestic 
demand and further fuel economic growth.  End summary. 
 
2.  The Slovak GDP rose at a real annual rate of 5.3 percent in 
the third quarter of 2004, down moderately from the 5.5 percent 
and 5.4 percent growth of the second and first quarter.  In real 
prices, the GDP equaled USD 11.3 billion, 8.8 percent higher than 
the third quarter of 2003.  The Slovak economy outpaced all of 
its neighbors as the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary 
registered 3.6, 4.8, and 3.7 percent growth respectively.  For 
the EU, GDP growth equaled 2.1 percent for the quarter. 
 
3.  Domestic demand, up 7.3 percent, has replaced exports as the 
largest driving force of the economy.  This rise was fueled by a 
3.7 percent jump in household consumption, a 2.9 percent boost in 
public spending, as well as a 16.9 percent leap in gross 
investments (NOTE: gross investment equals investment plus change 
in inventories).  Much of this investment comes from the two auto 
factories now under construction and should intensify further as 
actual production begins in 2006.  Government spending should 
also continue to rise as the GOS has budgeted a 77 percent 
increase in construction for 2005. 
 
4.  The higher household spending was stimulated by increased 
real wages, which rose 1.2 percent in the quarter.  The average 
nominal monthly wage in Slovakia reached USD 510 during the same 
period, up 8.8 percent from 2003.  Analysts highlighted that 
third quarter real productivity improved by 15.8 percent from 
2003 with a 4.7 percent increase in labor costs for the same 
period, a clear sign of growing competitiveness of the Slovak 
economy. 
 
5.  Export growth in constant prices slowed to 5.1 percent in the 
third quarter, down from 16.4 percent in the second quarter of 
2004.  Economists cited a three week summer hiatus at Volkswagen, 
Slovakia\'s largest exporter, as the main reason for the drop. 
Poor economic performance in Germany, the largest importer of 
Slovak goods, and the EU in general, also contributed to the 
decrease (NOTE: In the first three quarters, around 85 percent of 
Slovakia\'s exports headed to the EU).  Imports rose by 9.6 
percent, down from 17 percent growth in the previous quarter. 
For the first time in two years, the net trade contribution to 
the Slovak economy was negative, reducing the GDP by 3.7 
percentage points. 
 
6.  The Slovak Statistics Office stated that it expects the 
economy to expand by 5.5 percent in 2004, compared to the 5.4 
percent market consensus.  The OECD anticipates the Slovak GDP to 
increase by 4.9 percent this year, followed by 4.8 percent and 
5.0 percent growth in 2005 and 2006.  The central bank drafted 
its monetary program on the expectation of 4.9 percent growth in 
2005.  Many analysts believe that growth around 5 percent appears 
sustainable into the next decade. 
 
7.  Comment.  Growth in real wages, projected between 3.5 and 5 
percent in 2005, increasing government expenditures, plus the 
start of auto production by Kia, Peugeot, and Ford should 
continue to push household consumption higher and reduce 
unemployment.  In addition, exports will likely return to higher 
rates of growth resulting in robust GDP growth for the next three 
years.  Finally, FDI inflow should exceed current account 
deficits and reduce Slovakia\'s net external debt burden.  End 
comment.

New NATO Training Mission Iraq Proposal 
--------------------------------------- 
1. (SBU) Lubomir Cano, Director of the Security Policy 
Department at the MFA, said the MOD and MFA have agreed upon 
a proposal to send five Slovak soldiers to the NATO Training 
Mission - Iraq (NTM-I).  The original parliamentary mandate 
allows up to 110 non-combat personnel to be deployed under 
Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  However, due to a lack of 
qualified personnel in specific roles in the Slovak Armed 
Forces, the Slovak contribution to OIF is currently at 105 
soldiers, and this proposal would raise the Slovak 
commitment to the maximum level.  The NTM-I proposal 
requires cabinet and parliamentary approval (currently 
scheduled for January 12), since the original Slovak mandate 
specifically allows soldiers to be deployed only as a part 
of OIF. 
 
2. (SBU) Cano said the MFA-MOD consensus did not consider 
more than five additional soldiers even though a new 
parliamentary mandate would be required in any case.  In a 
Radio Slovakia New Years address, PM Mikulas Dzurinda said 
he still supports the decision to send Slovak troops to 
Iraq.  He reaffirmed the need for Slovakia to contribute to 
European and global security but did not mention a possible 
NTM-I contribution. 
 
Secret Police Archives Prompt Resignation 
 
SIPDIS 
----------------------------------------- 
4. (U) State Secretary of the Ministry of Construction and 
SDKU MP Jan Hurny resigned due to allegations of cooperation 
with the Communist-era secret police (StB).  The Institute 
of the Memory of the Nation published the secret police 
files of all former agents six weeks ago.  (NOTE: \"Agent\" 
was the highest-level collaborator with the secret police.) 
Hurny\'s file include his signature, which he claims is 
forged.  Hurny\'s denial received much media criticism, and 
he is the first senior Slovak state official to resign due 
to alleged StB collaboration.  SDKU chairman and PM Mikulas 
Dzurinda accepted Hurny\'s resignation, and coalition 
partners welcomed it.  KDH chairman and Speaker of 
Parliament Pavol Hrusovsky said Hurny\'s case should become a 
precedent, and SMK leader Bela Bugar said Hurny made a good 
decision as he exposed his party to criticism.  ANO\'s 
Lubomir Lintner said Hurny should have stepped down sooner. 
 
5. (SBU) Shortly before the files became public, SDKU MP 
Jozef Banas admitted he was a StB agent.  He says that his 
StB file clearly shows that he never hurt anyone, and he 
does not intend to resign.  Banas, who was recently elected 
vice president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, said he 
does not consider the files a trustworthy source of 
information.  (COMMENT: Banas largely avoided the media 
controversy that Hurny attracted by admitting and explaining 
his former collaboration with the secret police before the 
files became public knowledge.) 
 
Slovakia Takes Lead of CEI 
-------------------------- 
6. (U) Slovakia has assumed the 2005 chairmanship of the 
Central European Initiative (CEI).  The intergovernmental 
organization attempts to aid aspiring EU states with their 
economic and democratic transitions and EU negotiations 
through parliamentary, governmental, and business contacts. 
CEI is comprised of seven EU member states (Austria, the 
Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, and 
Slovenia) and 10 aspiring member states (Albania, Belarus, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, 
Moldova, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, and Ukraine). 
 
7. (U) The GOS will focus the CEI\'s agenda in 2005 on two 
areas: the western Balkans and Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Moldova.  It will attempt to prevent the marginalization of 
these states and strengthen their regional identity.  The 
GOS will also host a May Foreign Ministers meeting, a 
November Prime Ministers meeting, and several development 
assistance programs such as a \"know-how exchange,\" primarily 
targeting economic transformation issues.  The GOS will 
launch a webpage (available in English) in mid-January:

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1. (U)  Summary.  On January 4, Econoff and FSN visited 
civic leaders in the Tatra region to discuss restoration and 
renewal efforts in the wake of the recent wind disaster that 
leveled 250 square kilometers of forest (reftel A).  Two of 
the leaders are also members of the GOS Commission 
established to coordinate cleanup and reconstruction 
efforts, which met for the first time on December 13 and 
will meet again on January 13.  All three leaders expressed 
dismay at NGO criticism of the Commission and were eager to 
participate in a potential Embassy-hosted DVC in which USG 
experts could share their experience in areas related to 
rebuilding destroyed forests.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  Jan Mokos, Mayor of Vysoke Tatry, Michal Sykora, 
Mayor of Strba and chairman of the regional association of 
towns and villages, and Milan Baran, City Manager of the 
District of Poprad, shared their ideas of the recovery 
effort with Econoff and FSN.  According to Mokos and Baran, 
members of the Commission, the GOS is just beginning its 
work and expects to engineer long-term results.  In its 
first official meeting in December, four working groups were 
created and assigned to specific duties.  First, the 
Ministries of Environment, Economy, Agriculture, and local 
governments were tasked with forging a consensus on what to 
do with the fallen timber, while considering an assessment 
of how much is salvageable, how much to remove, and how much 
to leave on the ground.  Mokos asserted that environmental 
groups want most of the wood to be left alone, citing 
potential flooding problems upon removal, while those with 
financial interests want simply to sell as much as possible. 
The local governments would like to at least remove the 
fallen trees lying within 100 meters of towns in order to 
reduce potential fire and insect problems.  A second group 
within the Commission was asked to design a secure program 
to handle any wood that is to be removed.  A third was 
charged with outlining a sustainable redevelopment plan that 
would eventually be handed over to an NGO for 
implementation.  Finally, a fourth group led by the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs was to calculate the final damages and 
work toward accessing EU funds to aid the recovery.  At the 
next meeting on January 13, each group will provide an 
update and, if possible, start to make specific 
recommendations. 
 
3. (U)  All three local leaders showed little regard for the 
criticism leveled at the Commission from environmental NGOs 
(reftel B).  Baran pointed out that these NGOs are based in 
the Bratislava and have not even visited the region or met 
with regional officials to consider local opinions.  Mokos 
averred that the Commission has attempted to be as 
transparent as possible by being open to media interviews, 
allowing all voices to be considered, and consulting with 
forestry and environmental professionals.  In addition, 
local NGOs are already active in coordinating relief funds, 
assessing damages, and performing impact studies. 
 
4. (SBU)  The local leaders were enthusiastic about the USG 
sharing its expertise during the recovery process.  Mokos 
specifically requested assistance on economic development in 
environmentally sensitive lands.  The Commission is 
attempting to strike the right balance between maintaining a 
healthy forest and creating a sustainable, tourist based 
economy.  Mokos suggested that a DVC on the topic would be 
appreciated but requested that, for public relations 
purposes, post make the suggestion directly to Prime 
Minister Mikulas Dzurinda.  Mokos additionally solicited a 
DVC on how to handle public relations after a disaster so 
that the GOS can better communicate with the media, the 
public, and NGOs.  Baran further expressed interest in 
sharing information about complex emergency warning systems 
as well as forest search and rescue procedures. 
 
5.  (U)   After clarification of the topic and participants, 
post will send a formal request through the usual channels 
for one or more DVCs.
