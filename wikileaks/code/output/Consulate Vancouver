TAGS:  PTER, PINS, MOPS, IN, CA 
SUBJECT:  MAJOR POLICE ACTION AGAINST SIKHS IN VANCOUVER 
 
1.  (C - ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
2.  THE RCMP AND VANCOUVER POLICE CARRIED OUT A SERIES OF ARRESTS 
AND COORDINATED SEARCHES OF THE HOMES OF MILITANT SIKHS HERE IN 
VANCOUVER NOVEMBER 6.  THE RCMP ARRESTS OF TALWINDER SINGH 
PARMAR AND INDERJIT SINGH REYAT WERE IN CONNECTION WITH THE NARITA 
AIRPORT EXPLOSION LAST JUNE.  THE VANCOUVER POLICE RAIDS WERE 
NOT RELATED TO THE NARITA BOMBING, BUT TO A NUMBER OF RECENT ATTACKS 
BY MILITANT SIKHS ON MORE MODERATE SIKHS HERE IN VANCOUVER. 
 
3.  PRESS REPORTS HERE PORTRAY THE ARREST OF PARMAR AND REYAT 
AS BEING RELATED BOTH TO THE NARITA AIRPORT BOMBING AND THE 
ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS LOSS OF AIR INDIA FLIGHT 182 OVER 
THE ATLANTIC.  PRESS REPORTS STATE THAT THE RCMP ARE CONVINCED THEY 
HAVE  PROOF THAT AIR INDIA FLIGHT 182 WAS DESTROYED BY A 
BOMB, AND THAT THE TWO INCIDENTS WERE LINKED, AND WERE ENGINEERED 
FROM THE VANCOUVER AREA.  APPARENTLY THE PRESS ACCOUNTS ARE 
SOMEWHAT EXAGGERATED. 
 
4.  ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DONALD WILSON, ACTING IN CHARGE OF 
THE RCMP IN BRITISH COLUMBIA TELLS ME THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT 
THE RCMP HAS AGAINST PARMAR AND REYAT RELATES ONLY TO THE 
NARITA AIRPORT BOMBING.  HE DID NOT SEEM OVERLY CONFIDENT THAT 
THE EVIDENCE WILL BE ENOUGH TO BRING CHARGES, BUT HE HOPES 
SO.  COMMISSIONER WILSON SAYS THAT THIS IS \"JUST ABOUT OUR LAST 
SHOT.\" 
 
5.  THE RAIDS BY THE VANCOUVER POLICE ON THE HOMES OF PROMINENT 
SIKH MILITANTS WERE RELATED TO A NUMBER OF INCIDENTS IN RECENT 
WEEKS IN WHICH THE MILITANTS HAVE ATTACKED MORE MODERATE SIKHS 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE SIKH COMMUNITY IN VANCOUVER. 
VIOLENT INTIMIDATION TACTICS HAVE REPORTEDLY FORCED MEMBERS OF 
A SIKH TEMPLE IN THE VANCOUVER SUBURB OF SURREY TO ACCEPT A 
\"COMPROMISE\" ACCORD THAT GIVES CONTROL TO THE FUNDAMENTALISTS. 
MANMOHAN SINGH, A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MILITANT INTERNATIONAL 
SIKH YOUTH FEDERATION, ASSERTS THAT THE FUNDAMENTALISTS NOW 
CONTROL THE SIKH TEMPLES IN ABBOTSFORD, SURREY, AND NEW 
WESTMINISTER, AND THE ROSS STREET TEMPLE IN VANCOUVER.  HE 
SAID THAT VOTING REGULATIONS AT THE OTHER VANCOUVER TEMPLE, 
ON SKEENA STREET, HAVE PREVENTED THE ISYF FROM GAINING CONTROL 
THERE.  SEVERAL SIKH MODERATES IN VANCOUVER HAVE RECENTLY BEEN 
THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT ATTACKS BY RADICAL SIKHS.  AND THE MILITANTS 
HAVE DISRUPTED A TEMPLE ELECTION IN NEW WESTMINISTER. 
 
6.  THE MAIN MILITANT SIKH GROUPS IN VANCOUVER ARE THE BABAR 
KHALSA AND THE INTERNATIONAL SIKH YOUTH FEDERATION.  THE BABAR 
KHALSA WAS FOUNDED AND IS HEADED BY TALWINDER SINGH PARMAR. 
A FORMER MEMBER, SURJAN SINGH GILL, ESTABLISHED THE CONSULATE 
OF THE SO-CALLED REPUBLIC OF KHALISTAN IN VANCOUVER.  THE 
INTERNATIONAL SIKH YOUTH FEDERATION IS HEADED BY SATINDERPAL 
GILL, BUT ITS MAIN SPOKESMAN APPEARS TO BE MANMOHAN SINGH, 
ONE OF THOSE WHOSE HOME WAS RAIDED BY THE POLICE.  POLICE 
FOUND A NUMBER OF WEAPONS AT HIS HOME.  OTHER MILITANT SIKHS 
WHO WERE QUESTIONED OR HAD THEIR HOMES SEARCHED WERE SODHI SINGH 
SODHI (ISYF); SURJAN SINGH GILL (FORMER MEMBER OF BABAR KALSA); 
SANGAT SINGH PAWA; AMARJIT SINGH PAWA; AND HARDIAL SINGH JOHAL.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAIR, PREL, PTER, XD, CA 
SUBJECT: AIR INDIA \"TRIAL OF THE CENTURY\" CONTINUES IN VANCOUVER 
 
    1. SUMMARY:  THE TRIAL OF TWO SUSPECTS IN THE 1985 BOMBING OF 
AIR INDIA FLIGHT 182, WHICH BEGAN IN FEBRUARY, CONTINUES AT THE 
BRITISH COLUMBIA SUPREME COURT.  THE AIR INDIA CASE IS THE 
LARGEST CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IN CANADIAN HISTORY AND THE TRIAL 
IS EXPECTED TO BE UNPRECEDENTED IN LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY. IT IS 
ESTIMATED IT WILL LAST WELL INTO 2004.  THE RCMP HAS 
INVESTIGATED THE CASE FOR 18 YEARS.  ACCUSATIONS CONTINUE THAT 
SECTORS OF THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT IGNORED CLUES THAT MAY HAVE 
PREVENTED THE BOMBING.  THE TRIAL HAS BEEN ADJOURNED UNTIL 
SEPTEMBER 8TH, 2003. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. BACKGROUND: ON JUNE 23, 1985, AIR INDIA FLIGHT 182 FROM 
MONTREAL TO LONDON, CARRYING LUGGAGE LOADED IN VANCOUVER, 
EXPLODED AND CRASHED INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN 240 KILOMETERS OFF 
THE COAST OF IRELAND. ALL 329 PEOPLE ON BOARD WERE KILLED. 
FIFTY-FOUR MINUTES EARLIER, A SUITCASE LOADED IN VANCOUVER ONTO 
CANADIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 003 EXPLODED IN THE AIRPORT AT NARITA, 
JAPAN. THE SUITCASE WAS BEING TRANSFERRED TO AIR INDIA FLIGHT 
301 TO BANGKOK AND DELHI. TWO BAGGAGE HANDLERS WERE KILLED AND 
FOUR OTHER PERSONS INJURED. 
 
3.  POLICE ALLEGE VANCOUVER MILLIONAIRE RIPUDAMAN SINGH MALIK 
AND AJAIB SINGH BAGRI PLANNED TO BOMB FLIGHT 182 AS PART OF A 
TERRORISM CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT. BOTH MEN WERE 
ALLEGED SIKH SEPARATISTS PLOTTING AGAINST THE NATIONAL AIRLINE 
OF INDIA IN RETALIATION FOR THE INDIAN ARMY\'S ATTACK A YEAR 
EARLIER ON THE GOLDEN TEMPLE AT AMRITSAR, SIKHISM\'S HOLIEST 
SHRINE. THE SUSPECTED MASTERMIND WAS TALWINDER SINGH PARMAR, A 
MILITANT SIKH RELIGIOUS LEADER IN VANCOUVER. HOWEVER, HE WAS 
NEVER CHARGED WITH MURDER AS PUNJABI POLICE KILLED HIM IN 1992. 
ON OCTOBER 27, 2000, MALIK AND BAGRI WERE ARRESTED IN RELATION 
TO THE BOMBINGS; THEY WERE CHARGED JOINTLY WITH EIGHT COUNTS 
INCLUDING MURDER, ATTEMPTED MURDER AND CONSPIRACY. 
 
4. THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK ON AIR INDIA WAS WIDELY KNOWN IN 
THE WEEKS BEFORE THE AIR INDIA BOMBING. MANY B.C. SIKHS HAD 
CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT OF THE AIRLINE.  THE VANCOUVER SUN REPORTED 
IN OCTOBER 2000 THAT PARMAR MADE A FIERY SPEECH AT A SIKH TEMPLE 
IN SOUTHEAST CALGARY IN THE SUMMER OF 1984 THAT AIR INDIA PLANES 
WOULD \"FALL FROM THE SKY.\" PARMAR\'S MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED 
PRIVATELY TO A GROUP OF ABOUT 20 WHO GATHERED IN THE TEMPLE TO 
HEAR THE FOUNDER OF ONE OF THE MOST MILITANT SIKH SEPARATIST 
GROUPS -- THE BABBAR KHALSA OR TIGERS OF THE TRUE FAITH. 
 
5.   THE LOCAL PRESS HAS DESCRIBED A CONTROVERSY THAT HAS 
DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP) AND 
CANADIAN INTELLIGENCE (CSIS) OVER THE CONDUCT OF THE 
INVESTIGATION AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN 
PREVENTED.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, MONTHS BEFORE THE 
BOMBING THE RCMP INVESTIGATED A TIP THAT AN AIR INDIA PLANE OUT 
OF MONTREAL WOULD BE BOMBED. THE RCMP ASKED CSIS FOR A THREAT 
ASSESSMENT ON ITS LIKELIHOOD.  POLICE CRITICS SUGGEST THAT CSIS 
IGNORED CLUES THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE BOMBING.  THERE HAVE 
ALSO BEEN ALLEGATIONS THAT THERE WAS A CSIS MOLE WORKING WITH 
THE ALLEGED BOMBING CONSPIRATORS. HOWEVER, THE RCMP AND THE CSIS 
HAVE BOTH DENIED THESE ALLEGATIONS.  THE AIR INDIA TRIAL IS 
CERTAIN TO GENERATE CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC DEBATE, MULTIPLE 
CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND ABUNDANT CRITICISM OF FORMER AND CURRENT 
PUBLIC OFFICIALS AS IT PROCEEDS OVER THE COMING YEAR OR MORE.
