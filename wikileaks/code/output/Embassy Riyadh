SUBJECT: THE ROLE OF SAUDI PRINCES IN UNIFORM 
 
1.  (S - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  THE PRESENCE OF A NUMBER OF SAUDI 
ROYAL FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE MILITARY--WE CAN IDENTIFY 
MORE THAN 25 AND THERE ARE CLEARLY OTHERS--HAS LONG 
BEEN A SUBJECT OF INTEREST.  ALSO THE FOCUS OF 
CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S 
WELL CALCULATED EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN CAREFUL CONTROL 
OVER THE MILITARY, TO PRECLUDE ITS BECOMING A THREAT 
TO THE REGIME.  THESE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN COMPLICATED 
IN RECENT YEARS BY THE OFTEN  CONTRADICTORY DEMANDS 
FOR AN EFFICIENT, WELL EQUIPPED  FORCE TO RESPOND 
TO REAL THREATS.  A KEY QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PRINCELY 
PRESENCE IN THE MILITARY IS PART OF THE ROYAL FAMILY 
CONTROL MECHANISM.  BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER IMPORTANT 
QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE ROYAL PRESENCE IN THE 
MILITARY:  IF NOT THERE AS PART OF A CONCERTED EFFORT 
TO MAINTAIN ROYAL CONTROL, WHAT ARE THE ATTRACTIONS 
OF THE MILITARY FOR PRINCES WHO APPEAR TO HAVE NO 
SHORTAGE OF CAREER CHOICES?  WHAT IMPACT DO PRINCES 
IN UNIFORM HAVE ON MILITARY EFFICIENCY AND UNIT 
MORALE GIVEN THEIR SPECIAL STATUS? 
 
THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A GENERALLY CONCEIVED 
PLAN TO MAINTAIN PRINCELY CONTROL OF THE MILITARY, 
SPECIFICALLY IN THE PLACEMENT OF THE MOST SENIOR 
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY IN POSITIONS OF CIVILIAN 
CONTROL OVER ALL UNIFORMED ELEMENTS--DEFENSE, 
NATIONAL GUARD AND INTERIOR, INCLUDING ITS PARA- 
MILITARY FORCES.  GOING FURTHER, THE PREPONDERANCE 
OF PRINCELY PRESENCE IN THE LAND AND AIR FORCES, THE 
TWO STRONGEST ELEMENTS OF THE MILITARY, AND THE 
EY POSITIONS HELD BY CERTAIN OF THE UNIFORMED PRINCES, 
SUGGESTS A BROADER DESIGN FOR ROYAL PRESENCE AND 
CONTROL.  BUT THERE ARE COUNTER SIGNALS, PROBABLY 
MOST IMPORTANT BEING REAL QUESTIONS AS TO HOW 
EFFECTIVE SUCH CONTROL MIGHT BE, GIVEN THE DIVERSITY 
OF INTERESTS WITHIN THE ROYAL FAMILY.  JUNIOR 
PRINCES IN MANY CASES HAVE VERY LITTLE REASON TO 
FEAR THE IMPOSITION OF DIRECT CONTROLS FROM THE KING. 
OVERALL, IT IS OUR JUDGEMENT THAT THERE IS MORE 
APPEARANCE THAN REALITY TO THE CONCEPT OF MILITARY 
PRINCES, BELOW THE VERY TOP LEVELS, BEING CAREFULLY 
PLACED WITH THE AIM OF ENHANCING FAMILY CONTROL. 
THIS JUDGEMENT IS REINFORCED BY OTHER SOLID 
ALTERNATIVE REASONS FOR PRINCES TO JOIN THE MILITARY: 
GLAMOUR AND EXCITEMENT, THE HISTORICALLY HONORABLE 
STATUS OF MILITARY SERVICE, BUSINESS SPIN-OFFS FROM 
THE LARGE MILITARY BUDGET, AND EVEN USE OF THE 
MILITARY AS A STEPPING STONE FOR BIGGER THINGS. 
WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THE DEGREE TO WHICH 
PRINCES EXERT A STABILIZING EFFECT IN THE MILITARY, 
THEIR MERE PRESENCE SHOULD BE OF SOME BENEFIT TO THE 
REGIME.  HAVING PRINCES IN THE ARMED FORCES, REGARDLESS 
OF THEIR MOTIVES FOR BEING THERE, DOES PROVIDE A CERTAIN 
DEGREE OF INFLUENCE AND OVERSIGHT. 
 
AS FOR THE IMPACT OF UNIFORMED PRINCES ON MILITARY 
MORALE AND EFFICIENCY, THIS CUTS BOTH WAYS.  CLEARLY, 
THEY DO COMMAND SPECIAL TREATMENT AND ARE LESS BOUND 
BY MILITARY DISCIPLINE, WITH RESULTING RESENTMENT. 
BUT SPECIAL TREATMENT IS NOT LIMITED TO PRINCES IN 
THE MILITARY; STRICT MILITARY DISCIPLINE IS NOT IN 
THE OVERALL SAUDI TRADITION; AND A NUMBER OF THE 
MILITARY PRINCES MORE THAN BALANCE THE NEGATIVES 
WITH THE HIGH QUALITY OF THEIR MILITARY ABILITY. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  INTRODUCTION.  WHEN WE SPEAK OF MILITARY FORCES 
IN SAUDI ARABIA, WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT FORCES UNDER 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION (MODA), THE 
SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL GUARD (SANG) AS WELL AS THE 
SECURITY FORCES, FRONTIER FORCES AND COAST GUARD 
ELEMENTS OF THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR (MOI). 
HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF DISCUSSING THE ROLE OF 
PRINCES IN THE MILITARY, THIS REPORT IS CONFINED 
TO THE TWO MORE CLASSICAL MILITARY INSTITUTIONS, THE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION AND THE SAUDI ARABIAN 
NATIONAL GUARD.  THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS 
REPORT DRAWS HEAVILY ON THE U.S. SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
ELEMENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA, CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL WHO DEAL 
WITH THE ARMED FORCES AS WELL AS THE EXPERIENCES OF 
EMBASSY PERSONNEL.  IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO 
UNDERTAKE ANY MEANINGFUL EFFORT TO PLUMB THE SAUDI 
PUBLIC OR MILITARY CONCERNING THEIR OWN, PERSONAL 
FEELINGS.  SOCIAL PRESSURE, CULTURAL BIAS, FEAR OF 
REPRISAL AND PLAIN DISTRUST OF FOREIGNERS ARE POWERFUL 
IMPEDIMENTS TO DIRECT INFORMATION GATHERING.  WE 
RECOGNIZE THEREFORE THAT OUR LIST OF PRINCES IS NOT 
COMPLETE, THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER FACTORS WE 
MAY NOT HAVE GIVEN THEIR PROPER EMPHASES, AND THAT 
SUBJECTIVITY MUST ENTER INTO OUR JUDGEMENTS.  HOWEVER, 
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE DISADVANTAGES, THE INFORMATION 
PROVIDED IN THIS REPORT PRESENTS THE BEST PICTURE 
AVAILABLE OF THE ROLE OF PRINCES IN THE SAUDI ARABIAN 
ARMED FORCES AND REPRESENTS A STARTING POINT ON THIS 
USEFUL SUBJECT. 
 
4.  THE PRESENCE OF MORE THAN 25 UNIFORMED PRINCES IN 
THE SAUDI ARABIAN ARMED FORCES RAISES A NUMBER OF 
INTERESTING QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE ROLE PLAYED BY 
THESE ROYAL OFFSPRING.  HOW THESE PRINCES AFFECT THE 
STABILITY OF THE MILITARY AS WELL AS THEIR INFLUENCE ON 
ITS EFFICIENCY AND CREDIBILITY AS A FIGHTING FORCE ARE 
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS.  IS ROYAL MILITARY 
SERVICE THE RESULT, TO A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE, OF 
AN ORCHESTRATED PLAN BY THE ROYAL FAMILY TO MAINTAIN 
A DIVERSIFIED PRESENCE IN AND CHECK ON THE MILITARY? 
WHY WOULD A PRINCE, WHO SUPPOSEDLY HAS EVERYTHING HE 
COULD POSSIBLY WANT, JOIN THE MILITARY?  HOW ENCUMBERED 
BY MILITARY DISCIPLINE IS HE?  WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON 
UNIT MORALE AND DISCIPLINE WHEN A PRINCE JOINS THE 
OUTFIT?  DO THESE PRINCES HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE OVER 
MILITARY DECISION MAKING?  IF SO, HOW FAR DOES THEIR 
AUTHORITY EXTEND INTO POLICY MAKING?  DO THEY \"ROUGH IT\" 
OR ARE THEY A PRIVILEGED LOT RELATIVELY EXEMPT FROM 
UNDERGOING HARDSHIP? 
 
5.  THE SAUDIS ARE EXTREMELY SECRETIVE ABOUT THEIR 
ROYAL AFFAIRS, AS THEY ARE ABOUT THE DEFENSE 
ESTABLISHMENT, AND IT IS THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO 
DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW MANY PRINCES ARE IN MILITARY 
SERVICE.  THE FOLLOWING LIST NOTES THOSE WHOSE DUTIES 
HAVE BROUGHT THEM TO THE MISSION\'S ATTENTION OR WHO 
WERE INTRODUCED IN CHANCE MEETINGS.  ONE FURTHER 
DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING WHO IS OR IS NOT A PRINCE 
IS THE COMMONALITY OF NAMES.  WHILE SOME ARE RELATED 
CLOSELY ENOUGH  TO ABDUL AZIZ FOR THEIR ANCESTRY TO 
BE APPARENT, EACH GENERATION ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF 
NAMES, CAUSING FAMILY ORIGIN TO BE INCREASINGLY 
OBSCURED TO OUTSIDERS.  SOME PREVIOUSLY KNOWN OFFICERS 
HAVE DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT.  THIS LIST IS THEREFORE 
NOT ALL INCLUSIVE.  BESIDES THE UNIFORMED PRINCES 
CONTAINED IN THE LIST, THERE ARE ALSO A LARGE NUMBER 
OF CIVILIAN PRINCES IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN ALL 
THE MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS.

6.  IT IS INEVITABLE THAT, WITH THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY 
NOW ESTIMATED TO NUMBER MORE THAN 5,000 MALE MEMBERS, 
SOME OF THESE PRINCES SHOULD FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE 
ARMED FORCES.  IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE 
PLAYED BY THE SENIOR PRINCES; THEY ARE THE MINISTERS 
AND SENIOR FUNCTIONARIES AT THE VERY TOP OF THE VARIOUS 
MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS, ENSURING POLITICAL CONTROL AND 
RESPONSIVENESS.  MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IS THE 
PLACE AND PURPOSE OF JUNIOR PRINCES IN MILITARY SERVICE, 
THOSE IN UNIFORM AND STARTING, AT LEAST, AS JUNIOR 
OFFICERS.  SINCE THE LOYALTY OF ITS ARMED FORCES HAS 
A CLEAR IMPACT ON THE STABILITY OF AL SAUD RULE, 
AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE \"ROYAL CONNECTION\" WITH 
MILITARY SERVICE IS USEFUL IN JUDGING HOW THE ROYAL 
FAMILY FEELS ABOUT AND DEALS WITH ITS MILITARY 
ESTABLISHMENT, AND HOW NON-ROYAL OFFICERS VIEW THEIR 
AL SAUD COMRADES IN ARMS.   END INTRODUCTION. 
 
7.  THE AL SAUD MONARCHY IS HIGHLY CONSCIOUS OF THE 
UTILITY OF A MODERN MILITARY FORCE AND HAS SPENT 
BILLIONS IN AN EFFORT TO CREATE ONE.  A WELL-TRAINED 
AND SUPERBLY-EQUIPPED MILITARY FORCE IS NOT ONLY VITAL 
TO THE DEFENSE OF THE FRONTIERS, RESOURCES AND RULING 
REGIME IN SAUDI ARABIA AGAINST OUTSIDE AGGRESSION 
BUT IS ALSO USEFUL AS A SYMBOL OF SAUDI NATIONALISM-- 
FOSTERING POPULAR ATTACHMENT TO THE AL SAUD DYNASTY, 
AS DISTINGUISHED FROM OLDER FOCAL POINTS OF LOYALTY 
AND MOTIVATION SUCH AS ARAB LINEAGE OR ISLAMIC FAITH. 
HOWEVER, THE AL SAUD DYNASTS HAVE SEEN MUSLIM 
MONARCHIES FALL TO COUPS D\'ETAT MOUNTED BY MILITARY 
OFFICERS.  THE HISTORY OF THE REGION OFFERS MANY 
EXAMPLES, SUCH AS EGYPT, IRAQ, AND LIBYA, IN WHICH 
THE ARMED FORCES OF THE COUNTRY, STRENGTHENED AND 
MODERNIZED, HAVE OVERTHROWN THE MONARCHIAL REGIME 
THEY WERE ESTABLISHED TO DEFEND.  THUS THE SURVIVAL 
OF THE REGIME REQUIRES THAT CIVILIANS--READ MEMBERS 
OF THE RULING FAMILY--MAINTAIN TIGHT CONTROL OVER THE 
MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT.  THE REGIME HAS PUT THIS 
FAMILIAR  PRINCIPLE INTO PRACTICE BY ENSURING THAT 
FAMILY MEMBERS SIT FIRMLY AT THE APEX OF EVERY 
MILITARY OR QUASI-MILITARY COMMAND PYRAMID--WHETHER 
IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION (MODA), THE 
NATIONAL GUARD, OR THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR. 
 
8.  GIVEN THESE SAME CONCERNS IT IS ALSO NOT 
SURPRISING THAT, UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY, THE RULERS 
OF SAUDI ARABIA DID VERY LITTLE TO IMPROVE THEIR 
ARMED FORCES EITHER QUANTITATIVELY OR QUALITATIVELY. 
THEY WERE CONTENT TO ALLOW THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
ONLY A MODEST MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION 
(MODA) AND MAINTAINED ONLY AN ANTIQUATED NATIONAL 
GUARD.  BUT THIS VIEW BEGAN TO CHANGE IN THE EARLY 
SIXTIES.  IN THE FACE OF WHAT THEY VIEWED AS 
NASSIRITE AGGRESSION FROM THE YEMEN, THE AL SAUD 
WERE FORCED TO RECOGNIZE THE VULNERABILITY OF THEIR 
OWN REGIME TO OUTSIDE MILITARY THREATS.  THEY BEGAN 
A MODEST ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE THEIR DEFENSE FORCES 
AND NATIONAL GUARD WHICH (WITH THE HELP OF NEW 
OIL WEALTH) BECAME A MAJOR EFFORT TO EXPAND AND 
UPGRADE ALL ELEMENTS OF THE MILITARY.  VAST BUILDING 
PROJECTS AND THE ACQUISITION OF SOPHISTICATED 
WEAPONRY HAVE BEEN A MAJOR SAG PREOCCUPATION FROM 
1974 TO THE PRESENT. 
 
9.   ALTHOUGH THERE WAS LIMITED SAUDI PARTICIPATION 
IN FIGHTING IN THE GOLAN IN 1973, IT WAS THE WAR BETWEEN 
IRAN AND IRAQ WHICH FORCED THE SAG TO COME TO TERMS 
WITH SOME OF THE REALITIES OF MODERN COMBAT.  ALL THE 
NEW EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD IS OF LITTLE VALUE WITHOUT 
A COHESIVE OFFICER CORPS CAPABLE OF MAKING QUICK, 
SOPHISTICATED USE OF THEIR WEAPONRY.  UNFORTUNATELY, 
THIS IS PRECISELY THE SORT OF MILITARY ORGANIZATION 
BEST SUITED, AND HENCE MORE LIKELY, TO SEEK POWER IN 
ITS OWN RIGHT.  THE AL SAUD HAVE ACCEPTED THE NEED TO 
DEVELOP THE COMMAND, CONTROL, COORDINATION AND STAFFING 
MECHANISMS NEEDED TO OPERATE A MODERN MILITARY FORCE. 
PEACE SHIELD, THE SAUDIS\' MULTIBILLION DOLLAR C3 PROGRAM 
FOR AIR DEFENSE, MAY EVENTUALLY LINK THE AIR DEFENSE 
COMMAND, RSAF AND ROYAL SAUDI NAVY, BUT THIS PROGRAM 
DOES NOT BEGIN TO TACKLE THE QUESTION OF COMBINED ARMS 
OPERATIONAL CONTROL.  IT ADDRESSES WHAT UNQUESTIONABLY 
IS THE GREATEST CURRENT THREAT PERCEIVED BY THE SAUDI 
REGIME, THAT OF AN AIR ATTACK AGAINST THEIR PETRO- 
INDUSTRIAL-DESALINATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE 
EASTERN PROVINCE.  HOWEVER, IMPLEMENTATION EVEN OF THIS 
PROGRAM HAS BEEN SLOW AND A SYSTEM WHICH INTEGRATES 
ALL THE MILITARY SERVICES, LET ALONE MODA AND THE SANG, 
IS A LONG WAY OFF.  FURTHER STEPS FACILITIATING MILITARY 
COORDINATION BETWEEN SERVICES AND ITS TRANSFER OUT OF THE 
HANDS OF PRINCELY AUTHORITY AND INTO THOSE OF A MILITARY 
GENERAL STAFF DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE IN THE CARDS. 
 
10.  WARY THAT A STRONG, COHESIVE MILITARY MIGHT POSE 
A THREAT TO THEIR RULE, THE AL SAUD TREAT EVERY BRANCH 
OF THE MILITARY AS A SEPARATE ENTITY WITH ITS OWN 
EQUIPMENT, GARRISON AND DISTINCT LINES OF COMMAND AND 
CONTROL.  THUS THE ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE ARE HAMPERED 
BY INCOMPATIBILITY OF COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT, SPARE 
PARTS AND AMMUNITION AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, MUTUAL 
DISTRUST SOMETIMES BORDERING ON DISDAIN.  THE NATIONAL 
GUARD AND MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION HAVE BUT 
LIMITED CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER, LITTLE CHANCE AT 
INTEROPERABILITY, AND NO PROVISIONS FOR JOINT OPERATIONS 
EXCEPT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE BROADEST MISSION 
STATEMENTS.  ARMY FORCES ARE ALL GARRISONED WELL AWAY 
FROM THE CAPITAL.  THE ONLY GROUND FORCES NEAR RIYADH 
BELONG TO THE NATIONAL GUARD.  RIYADH AIRBASE HAS NO 
FIGHTER SQUADRONS.  IT IS A FAIR ASSESSMENT TO SAY THAT 
THE SAUDI REGIME HAS TRIED TO ACHIEVE A DELICATE BALANCE, 
HAVING THE MILITARY CAPABILITY AND EFFICIENCY TO MEET 
POTENTIAL EXTERNAL THREATS, BUT NOT SO MUCH AS TO 
ENDANGER THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S OWN DOMESTIC POSITION. 
 
11.  BUT ARE THE PRINCES IN THE MILITARY AN ELEMENT 
OF THE SAME CONTROL PROCESS?  DOES THEIR PRESENCE HAVE 
AN IMPACT ON THE REGIME\'S SECURITY, ON THE EFFICIENCY 
OF THE ARMED FORCES, ON MILITARY MORALE?  DO SENIOR 
PRINCES WITH MINISTERIAL POSITIONS CAREFULLY PLACE THEIR 
JUNIORS IN KEY, UNIFORMED JOBS?  THE COMPLEXITY OF 
AL SAUD FAMILY POLITICS MAKES HIGHLY SPECULATIVE ANY 
ATTEMPT TO INFER THE ORGANIZATION AND CONTROL THAT 
WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PLACE OFFICERS INTO KEY POSITIONS 
IN THE MILITARY SUITABLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF A 
WATCHDOG ROLE.  MOREOVER, FAR FROM BEING A MONOLITHIC 
ORGANIZATION, THE AL SAUD FAMILY IS A SPRAWLING ENTITY 
WITH AN ARRAY OF DISCRETE AND SOMETIMES COMPETITIVE 
INTERESTS; COHESION AND INTERNAL CONTROL ARE A MAJOR 
PREOCCUPATION OF THE SENIOR-MOST PRINCES. 
 
12.  UNQUESTIONABLY, THERE ARE REASONS WHY PRINCES 
MIGHT PLAY A ROLE IN THE MILITARY BY DESIGN.  GIVEN 
AN ABUNDANCE OF WELL-EDUCATED, LOYAL PRINCES, A 
LOGICAL MOVE FOR THE AL SAUD TO MAKE WOULD BE TO 
ENCOURAGE SOME OF THESE YOUNG MEN TO JOIN THE MILITARY. 
SUCH MEN, IMBUED AS THEY ARE WITH A VESTED SELF- 
INTEREST IN THE REGIME, COULD SERVE AS ITS EYES AND EARS 
AND ALSO EXERT AN INFLUENCE ON THE REST OF THE OFFICER 
CORPS.  CLEARLY THE TOP ECHELON OF THE SAG IS COMPOSED 
ENTIRELY OF PRINCES.  KING FAHD BIN ABDUL AZIZ IS THE 
SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES.  HE EXERCISES 
CONTROL OVER THE REGULAR MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT 
THROUGH HIS FULL BROTHER, SULTAN BIN ABDUL AZIZ, 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND AVIATION.  WHILE THE KING IS 
ALSO NOMINAL CHIEF OF THE SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL GUARD, 
HIS HALF BROTHER, ABDULLAH BIN ABDUL AZIZ, IS ITS 
COMMANDER.  THE KING WOULD PROBABLY HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY 
IN EXERTING ARBITRARY AUTHORITY OVER ABDULLAH, 
ESPECIALLY IN MATTERS AFFECTING THE SANG.  DECISIONS 
ARE OFTEN MADE WITH SENIOR FAMILY AGREEMENT.  SINCE 
SURVIVAL OF THE REGIME IS THE AL SAUD FAMILY\'S FIRST 
IMPERATIVE, THERE IS LITTLE VISIBLE SIGN OF DISHARMONY. 
AS CROWN PRINCE AND THUS FAHD\'S PUTATIVE SUCCESSOR, 
STABILITY OF THE REGIME IS ALSO VERY MUCH IN 
ABDULLAH\'S PERSONAL INTEREST. 
 
13.  MANY SEEMINGLY INFLUENTIAL POSITIONS BELOW THE 
CIVILIAN POLITICAL DIRECTION LEVEL ARE HELD BY PRINCES. 
UNTIL RECENTLY, THE DIRECTOR OF AIR  OPERATIONS 
FOR THE RSAF WAS A PRINCE.  TWO OF THE FIGHTER BASE 
COMMANDERS ARE PRINCES.  (A THIRD IS COMMANDED BY 
AN AL-SUDAIRY, ONE OF THE FAMILIES LONG ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY (SEE PARA 16).  WHILE OFTEN 
ADDRESSED AS \"PRINCE,\" AND CLEARLY POSSESSING 
EXCELLENT ROYAL CONNECTIONS, EARLIER REPORTS OFFICIALLY 
LABELING COL AHMED BIN MUSAID AL-SUDAIRY AS A PRINCE 
WERE IN ERROR.)  A NUMBER OF THE MILITARY POLICE 
LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE ARMY ARE HELD BY PRINCES 
AS WELL.  THE DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE NAVY IS A PRINCE. 
IN THE SANG, THE MOST POLITICIZED OF THE SERVICES, 
WE FIND NOT ONLY THE TOP TWO POSITIONS HELD BY 
CIVILIANS BUT ALSO CIVILIAN PRINCES IN KEY ROLES AS 
THE SANG COMMANDERS IN THE WESTERN PROVINCE, 
ABDULLAH\'S SON KHALID, THE EASTERN PROVINCE, MISHARI 
BIN SAUD,AS WELL AS OTHERS IN MORE REMOVED FINANCIAL 
AND ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS. 
 
14.  MOST PRINCES IN UNIFORM ARE OFFICERS IN THE RSAF 
AND THE ARMY (SAUDI ARABIAN LAND FORCES, OR SALF), 
THE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE ARMED FORCES MOST CAPABLE OF 
MOUNTING A THREAT TO AL SAUD RULE.  PRINCES ARE MORE 
COMMON IN THE OFFICER RANKS OF THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS 
THAN IN ALL THE OTHERS (NAVY, SANG, MOI QUASI- 
MILITARY FORCES).  IF PRINCES ARE IN THE ARMED FORCES 
TO FULFILL AN OVERSIGHT ROLE, THEY ARE CERTAINLY IN 
THE RIGHT BRANCHES OF THE SERVICE. 
 
15.  BUT IF THERE ARE THESE INDICATIONS SUPPORTING 
THE CONCEPT OF DIRECTED ROYAL PLACEMENT IN THE 
MILITARY, THERE IS MUCH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE 
ALSO TENDING TO SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT THE PRESENCE 
AND PLACEMENT OF PRINCES IN THE MILITARY REFLECTS 
INDIVIDUAL INCLINATION AND AMBITION AS MUCH AS-- 
OR MORE THAN--THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PUTATIVE 
PROTECTION PLAN ELABORATED BY THE AL SAUD.  PRINCES 
FREELY REFUSE ASSIGNMENTS AND APPEAR TO BE FREE TO 
LEAVE THE SERVICE IF THEY DESIRE TO DO SO.  THE 
AL SAUD LEADERSHIP APPEARS TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT 
PUSHING PRINCES TOO FAR TOO FAST AS WELL.  PROMOTIONS 
INTO THE GENERAL OFFICER RANKS HAVE ONLY RECENTLY 
BEEN MADE.  BREAKING THE PROMOTION ICE WAS 
COL. FAHD B. ABDULLAH, FORMER RSAF DIRECTOR OF 
AIR OPERATIONS, WHO BECAME SAUDI ARABIA\'S FIRST 
PRINCE TO BE PROMOTED THROUGH THE OFFICER RANKS TO 
BRIGADIER GENERAL IN JANUARY 1984.  THIS PROMOTION 
WAS LATER FOLLOWED BY THE PROMOTIONS OF COL. FAYSAL B. 
MUHAMMED, SALF AVIATION CHIEF, AND KHALID B. SULTAN, 
DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE RSADF. 
 
16.  THERE IS ALSO A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ROYAL 
CONTROL IS REALLY FURTHERED THROUGH A PRINCELY 
PRESENCE.  ABDUL AZIZ FATHERED 45 ACKNOWLEDGED SONS 
FROM AT LEAST 22 WIVES.  THE SURVIVORS AMONG THESE 
SONS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN OFFSPRING, HAVE, OVER 
THE YEARS, ESTABLISHED INFORMAL BLOCKS COMPOSED 
GENERALLY OF GROUPINGS OF FULL-BROTHERS BUT ALSO 
INCLUDING HALF-BROTHER ALLIES.  TO THESE MUST BE 
ADDED THE SONS OF ABDUL AZIZ\'S RELATIVES WHOSE 
FAMILIES CONSTITUTE THE AL SAUD CADET BRANCHES, 
AND THE CHILDREN OF LONG TIME ASSOCIATES NOW 
MARRIED INTO THE GREATER FAMILY.  THESE LATTER 
GROUPS ARE IN AN AMBIGUOUS, AMBIVALENT POSITION: 
WHILE MANY AL SHAYKH AND AL SUDAIRY DAUGHTERS CONTINUE 
TO MARRY YOUNG SCIONS OF THE AL SAUD, MALE MEMBERS 
OF THESE FAMILIES OFTEN EXHIBIT--AND SOMETIMES ARE 
REMINDED BY THE AL SAUD--THAT THEIR LINEAGE IS 
DISTANT.  THIS DIVERSIFICATION OF FAMILY GROUPINGS, 
WITH THEIR CONCOMITANT LOYALTIES, COMPLICATES THE 
ROYAL PRESENCE IN THE ARMED FORCES AND REFLECTS AMONG 
THE UNIFORMED PRINCES A DIVERSITY OF ROLES, INTERESTS 
AND ASPIRATIONS.  THIS DIVERSITY IMPOSES LIMITS TO THE 
DEGREE OF CONTROL AVAILABLE TO THE SENIOR PRINCES 
THROUGH THE PRESENCE OF PRINCES IN THE MILITARY. 
IT IS SIMILARLY FLAWED EVEN AS AN INFORMATION/ 
INTELLIGENCE CONDUIT.  OFFICER PRINCES ARE OFTEN 
ABLE TO AVOID SUBJUGATING THEIR PERSONAL GOALS AND 
AMBITIONS TO THE DESIRES OF THEIR MORE REMOVED UNCLES 
AND COUSINS. 
 
17.  CONTROL AMONG THE SENIOR PRINCES IS COMPLICATED 
ENOUGH (SEE PARA 12).  IT IS EVEN MORE SO AMONG 
THE JUNIORS.  THE PRINCES ALL APPEAR TO BE LOYAL 
TO THE REGIME.  WHILE THERE MAY BE A VARIETY OF 
DIFFERENT SELF-INTERESTS AMONG THEM, ALL THE PRINCES 
ARE DEPENDENT ON THE MONARCHY FOR THEIR STATION IN 
LIFE.  COMPLICATIONS BEGIN WHEN WE EXAMINE THE 
MAKEUP OF THE ROYAL FAMILY AND SEE THAT WHILE MANY 
BEAR THE TITLE OF PRINCE, ALL PRINCES ARE NOT EQUAL. 
THIS LACK OF EQUALITY OFTEN BRINGS WITH IT A WIDE 
RANGE OF PRIORITIES IN LIFE.  SOME PRINCES, MOSTLY 
FROM THE MORE DISTANT BRANCHES OF THE  FAMILY, 
ARE LESS CONCERNED WITH POWER POLITICS AND MORE 
WITH JUST PLAIN UPWARD MOBILITY.  UNABLE TO ASPIRE 
TO THE HIGHEST OFFICES IN THE LAND, THESE PRINCES 
HOLD A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER ASPIRATIONS AND 
AMBITIONS.  FIRST PRIORITY FOR THESE MEN CAN BE 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, 
THE SECURING OF A CONTRACT, THE PURCHASE OF NEW 
EQUIPMENT OR THE OPENING OF A NEW BRANCH OFFICE, 
JUST AS MUCH AS THE SECURING OF A MILITARY PROMOTION 
OR NEW, BETTER POSITION.  THE REGIME APPEARS TO BE 
FAIRLY TOLERANT OF THIS ATTITUDE. 
 
18.  IN SUM, WE CAN SAY THAT AT THE VERY TOP OF THE 
CHAIN OF COMMAND--THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL--PRINCES 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER THE ARMED 
FORCES AND OPERATE THOSE FORCES VERY MUCH WITH 
THE SURVIVAL OF SAUDI ARABIA AND THE REGIME IN MIND. 
AS WE GO FARTHER DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND, WE FIND 
A NUMBER OF PRINCES WHOSE REASON FOR BEING THERE IS 
MUCH MORE OBSCURE.  HOWEVER, IF  THEY ARE NOT 
SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF TIME LOOKING AFTER THE 
INTERESTS  OF THE REGIME, THEY AT LEAST GIVE 
OUTSIDERS THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY MIGHT BE.  THUS 
THE REGIME PROBABLY PROFITS MORE FROM THE PERCEPTION 
THAN THE REALITY, AND MORE SO AMONG THE EXPATRIATE 
COMMUNITY THAN INSIDERS.  ALTHOUGH SOME PRINCES ARE 
IN POSITIONS FROM WHERE THEY CAN OVERSEE THE GOINGS 
ON IN THE MILITARY, THERE ARE ENOUGH 
KEY POSITIONS FILLED BY COMMONERS AND, SIMILARLY, 
ENOUGH POSITIONS FILLED BY PRINCES WHERE THERE IS 
RELATIVELY LITTLE CONTROL OR OVERSIGHT TO CAST 
DOUBT THAT THE AL SAUD MAKE ANYTHING MORE THAN A 
HALF-HEARTED ATTEMPT TO POSITION THEIR TRUSTED SONS 
IN KEY JOBS.  SELECTIONS APPEAR  TO BE BASED ON 
THE PRINCES\' INDIVIDUAL DESIRES, AND THE AVAILABILITY 
OF POSITIONS AT A GIVEN TIME. 
 
19.  IF PRINCES ARE NOT IN THE MILITARY TO ACT PRIMARILY 
AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REGIME, WHY THEN ARE THEY 
THERE?  FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE NOT MANY JOBS THAT A 
PRINCE WILL ACCEPT.  WHILE SOME OF THE OLDER, MORE 
RETIRING PRINCES ARE CONTENT WITH THE WORLD OF 
BUSINESS AND FINANCE, THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH MANY 
OF THE YOUNGER, WESTERN EDUCATED AND MORE WORLDLY 
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY.  FOR SOME, THERE IS SIMPLY 
NO MOTIVATION TO SPEND LONG HOURS TENDING AFTER 
FAMILY BUSINESS INTERESTS.  FOR OTHERS, DEALING 
DIRECTLY IN BUSINESS IS DEMEANING.  FOR STILL OTHERS, 
THERE IS A YEARNING FOR BIGGER, MORE IMPORTANT TASKS. 
 
20.  THROUGHOUT HISTORY, MILITARY SERVICE HAS BEEN AN 
ACCEPTABLE OCCUPATION FOR MEMBERS OF THE NOBILITY. 
DEFENSE OF THE FAITH AND THE NATION, HONOR AND 
GLORY, PRIDE AND ALL THE OTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF 
MILITARY SERVICE PERMIT PRINCES TO JOIN THE ARMED 
FORCES ALONG WITH THEIR COMMONER COUNTRYMEN.  WHILE 
THE PREPONDERANCE OF PRINCES ARE IN THE SALF AND RSAF, 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY THIS SHOULD BE THE 
CASE.  IN A COUNTRY WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF EXCITING 
DIVERSIONS, FLYING AN F-15 OR AN F-5 WITH THE 
POTENTIAL OF ENGAGING IN AERIAL COMBAT IS VERY 
STIMULATING.  VIRTUALLY ALL THE PRINCES IN THE RSAF 
ARE PILOTS.  TWO FIGHTER BASES ARE COMMANDED BY 
PRINCES.  THEIR ACCESS TO THE BEST EDUCATION, THEIR 
LEADERSHIP ADVANTAGES AND THE BASIC ABILITY OF MANY 
OF THE RSAF PRINCES ALL MAKE THEIR APPOINTMENT TO 
LEADERSHIP POSITIONS A LOGICAL OUTCOME OF SERVICE. 
 
21. SERVICE IN THE LAND FORCES GROWS OUT OF A LONG 
TRADITION OF GROUND COMBAT.  THE VIEW AMONG THE 
BEDOUIN OF SAUDI ARABIA IS THAT SERVICE IN THE \"GROUND 
GAINING ARMS\" OF THE MILITARY, WHETHER FOR DEFENSE, 
OR IN OLDER TIMES FOR THE HONOR IT WAS POSSIBLE TO 
ACQUIRE IN THE ONCE PERENNIAL RAIDING, IS THE MOST 
HONORED FORM OF MILITARY SERVICE.  IF MANY OF THE MORE 
EDUCATED, COSMOPOLITAN SAUDIS, PRINCES AND COMMONERS, 
ARE FINDING THE OTHER BRANCHES OF SERVICE--AIR FORCE, 
NAVY AND AIR DEFENSE--EQUALLY ATTRACTIVE, FAMILY AND 
SOCIAL PRESSURE STILL FORCE  MANY OF THOSE WHO DO 
ENTER MILITARY SERVICE TO ENTER THE LAND FORCES AND 
SANG.  RELUCTANT AS SOME MAY BE TO JOIN, SERVICE IN 
THE SANG CAN AMOUNT TO A FAMILY OBLIGATION FOR FAVORS 
GIVEN OR EXPECTED IN THE FUTURE.  AT THE SAME TIME, 
SANG OFFICERS AUTOMATICALLY INCUR A DEBT OF LOYALTY 
TO CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH.  THIS REQUIREMENT PROBABLY 
KEEPS PRINCES WHOSE FAMILY LOYALTIES ARE TO OTHER 
SECTORS OF THE FAMILY, OUT OF THE SANG. 
 
22.  JOINING THE ARMED FORCES CARRIES WITH IT A NUMBER 
OF OBVIOUS BENEFITS.  A NUMBER OF PRINCES HAVE USED 
MILITARY SERVICE TO ESTABLISH THEIR CREDENTIALS AS 
CAPABLE LEADERS AND HAVE GONE ON TO OTHER CAREERS 
IN GOVERNMENT.  OTHERS SEEM INCLINED TO GO FROM THE 
MILITARY INTO BUSINESS HAVING MADE LUCRATIVE CONTACTS 
OR BEGUN THEIR FORTUNES IN OTHER WAYS WHILE IN THE 
SERVICE.  OTHERS STAY IN THE SERVICE BALANCING MILITARY 
DUTY WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.  HOWEVER, ONE FACT STANDS 
OUT ABOVE ALL THE REST--MILITARY SERVICE IS NO BAR 
TO GETTING WEALTHY.  MANY OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN 
HAVE AMASSED GREAT FORTUNES THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF 
MILITARY SERVICE.  UNTIL RECENTLY, MODA WAS A SEEMINGLY 
INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF CONTRACTS, PROJECTS, PROCUREMENT 
ACTIONS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.  WITH NO ENFORCEMENT 
OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAWS AGAINST PRINCES, MEMBERS 
OF THE MILITARY, TOGETHER WITH THEIR CIVILIAN RELATIVES, 
TAPPED THIS VAST RESERVE OF FUNDS.  FOR PRINCES, THE 
INSIDE TRACK PROVIDED BY THEIR FAMILY CONNECTION 
HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OUTSHINE ALL THEIR 
NON-ROYAL COLLEAGUES.  THE HIGHER IN RANK, THE BIGGER 
THE OPPORTUNITIES. 
 
23.  SOME OFFICERS, SUCH AS COL TURKI BIN NASSIR, 
BASE COMMANDER AT DHAHRAN AND SON OF NASSIR BIN 
ABDUL AZIZ, HAVE MADE NO SECRET OF THEIR BUSINESS 
ACTIVITIES.  AMONG HIS INTERESTS ARE SEVERAL 
BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE F-15 SQUADRON COMMANDER LTC 
MANSOUR BIN BANDAR, ANOTHER PRINCE, IS HIS PARTNER. 
OTHER PRINCES, SUCH AS THE FORMER RSAF DIRECTOR 
OF AIR OPERATIONS, BG FAHD BIN ABDULLAH BIN MUHAMMED 
BIN SAUD AL KABIR, AND HIS YOUNGER UNCLE, BG FAYSAL 
BIN MUHAMMED BIN SAUD AL KABIR, CONDUCT BUSINESS 
THROUGH RELATIVES OR OTHER SURROGATES OUTSIDE THE 
MILITARY.  WHILE FAYSAL, HEAD OF ARMY AVIATION, 
APPEARS TO OWN ONLY A TRAFFIC  LIGHT COMPANY, 
IN REALITY HE IS TIED THROUGH HIS BROTHERS INTO 
MANY ESTABLISHMENTS DIRECTLY RELATED NOT ONLY TO 
ARMY AVIATION BUT ALSO OTHER MILITARY AREAS FROM 
WHICH HE TOO IS PROFITING.  LTC MANSOUR BIN BANDAR, 
THE COMMANDER OF THE F-15 SQUADRON AT THE DHAHRAN 
AIR BASE, RECENTLY DECLINED A TRANSFER WHICH WOULD 
HAVE MADE HIM BASE COMMANDER IN TAIF.  THE REPORTED 
REASON FOR THIS REFUSAL WAS THE REQUIREMENT TO 
GIVE UP PERSONAL CONTROL OF HIS BUSINESS OPERATIONS 
IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE. 
 
24.  MINDEF SULTAN\'S SON, BG KHALID BIN SULTAN, IS 
THE DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE ROYAL SAUDI AIR DEFENSE 
FORCES.  IN HIS ROLE AS DEPUTY COMMANDER, KHALID 
HAS PROFITED SMARTLY FROM THE VARIOUS WEAPONS 
DEALS HE HAS HELPED ENGINEER.  REPORTEDLY, BOTH 
KHALID AND HIS FATHER OBTAINED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS IN THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED DEAL TO PURCHASE 
SHAHINE MISSILES FROM THE FRENCH.  OTHER PRINCES 
HAVE PROFITED BY WRITING THE SPECIFICATIONS NEEDED 
FOR A PARTICULAR WEAPON OR SERVICE TO FIT A PARTICULAR 
COMPANY\'S OFFER OR THE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR 
COMPETITIVE RUNOFFS.  OFTEN, AS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE 
CASE OF A LARGE FOOD SERVICE COMPANY SUPPORTING MODA, 
THE OWNER CAN BESTOW THE CONTRACT ON HIMSELF, IN THIS 
CASE, VICE DEFENSE MINISTER ABDUL RAHMAN.  INSIDE 
TRADING IS A COMMON PRACTICE.  SINCE THERE ARE NO 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST WORRIES, THE PRINCES OFTEN ACT 
WITH IMPUNITY.  A NUMBER OF PRINCES ARE MANEUVERING 
ACTIVELY FOR A PIECE OF THE PEACE SHIELD OFFSET 
PACKAGE.  SOME HAVE ARRANGED THE PLACEMENT OF PERSONAL 
EMPLOYEES WITH COMPANIES THEY THOUGHT WOULD GET A 
PIECE OF THE ACTION. 
 
25.  DESPITE AL SAUD PREOCCUPATION WITH IT, MONEY 
IS NOT THE ONLY ATTRACTION FOUND IN MILITARY SERVICE. 
WHILE SOME PRINCES DEVOTE THEMSELVES ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY 
TO SELF ENRICHMENT, AND OTHERS, LIKE THE SAUD AL KABIR, 
CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH MONEY AS A HANDSOME SIDELINE 
TO THEIR MILITARY CAREERS, OTHERS HAVE HIGHER 
ASPIRATIONS.  THE MILITARY CAN BE A STEPPING STONE 
TO BIGGER THINGS.  IT IS CLEARLY NOT A DISADVANTAGE. 
AMONG THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLES ARE THAT OF BANDAR 
BIN SULTAN, ANOTHER SON OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE, 
AND MITIEB BIN ABDULLAH, SON OF THE CROWN PRINCE. 
BANDAR WAS DOUBTLESS A BUSINESSMAN WHEN HE WAS IN 
UNIFORM.  FOR THAT MATTER, HE STILL IS INVOLVED 
IN BUSINESSES HE HAD WHEN F-15 COMMANDER IN DHAHRAN. 
HOWEVER, HE IS ALSO A VERY AMBITIOUS MAN WHO ASPIRES 
TO DOING GREAT THINGS FOR HIS COUNTRY.  BANDAR WAS 
QUICK TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED BY THE ARMS 
SALE DEBATE IN THE U.S. IN THE EARLY 80\'S.  HE 
QUICKLY BECAME AN ARTICULATE SPOKESMAN FOR HIS 
COUNTRY\'S MILITARY POLICY NEEDS.  HIS FAMILY 
CREDENTIALS AND POLITICAL ACUMEN ENABLED HIM TO 
GAIN ACCESS TO THE KING\'S EAR AND HIS PERSONAL 
CHARM AND ABILITY EARNED HIM THE KING\'S ATTENTION. 
NOW AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES AND SOMETIMES 
MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR FOR THE KING, BANDAR IS RUMORED 
TO BE HEADING FOR AN EVEN LARGER FOREIGN POLICY ROLE. 
ABDULLAH\'S SON, MITIEB, IS ALSO A VERY AMBITIOUS MAN. 
USING HIS POSITION AS SON OF THE SANG COMMANDER, MITIEB 
HAS QUICKLY RISEN IN RANK, FAR FASTER THAN ANYONE ELSE 
IN THE ORGANIZATION.  HE ANSWERS ONLY TO HIS FATHER 
AND PERHAPS HIS FATHER\'S MOST SENIOR ADVISOR.  MITIEB 
IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE MILITARY LIFE, HOWEVER. 
REPORTEDLY, HE IS ANXIOUS FOR A ROLE SIMILAR TO THAT 
OF BANDAR.  IF AND WHEN HIS FATHER BECOMES KING, 
MITIEB MAY WELL GET HIS WISH.  SOME OTHERS WHO HAVE 
MOVED ON ARE LISTED IN LAST SECTION OF LIST PROVIDED 
IN PARA 4.  THE VERY FACT THAT A NUMBER OF PRINCES 
HAVE MOVED ON FROM APPARENTLY SUCCESSFUL MILITARY 
CAREERS TENDS TO FAVOR THE VIEW THAT THE ROYAL 
FAMILY IS NOT THAT CONCERNED WITH THE PRINCELY 
PRESENCE IN THE MILITARY. 
 
26.  REGARDLESS OF THEIR REASON FOR BEING THERE, 
THE FINAL KEY QUESTION IS: WHAT IMPACT DOES THE 
ROYAL CONNECTION HAVE ON THE ARMED FORCES?  COMMAND 
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PRINCES AND THEIR COMMONER 
COLLEAGUES ARE ESTABLISHED BY PRINCE SULTAN AND 
PRINCE ABDULLAH.  IN THE SANG, NONE OF THE PRINCES 
APPEAR TO ANSWER TO ANYONE BUT THE CROWN PRINCE OR 
HIS MOST SENIOR DEPUTY.  HOWEVER, THE SANG IS SMALL, 
IS MORE ABDULLAH\'S PRIVATE DOMAIN, AND ITS UNIQUE 
TRIBAL ORIENTATION MAKES THE PLACE OF PRINCES 
(ESPECIALLY PRINCES RELATED TO ABDULLAH) MORE 
SECURE.  IN MODA, PRINCES ARE USUALLY IN A POSITION 
TO TAKE ORDERS FROM COMMONERS.  OFFICIAL POLICY 
SAYS THEY ARE TO BE TREATED ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK. 
BUT THE REAL RELATIONSHIP IS UNCLEAR.  A PRINCE 
HAS DIRECT ACCESS TO THE TOP, EITHER PERSONALLY OR 
THROUGH HIS FAMILY.  THE HIGHER THE PRINCE, THE 
EASIER IT IS FOR HIM TO GET HIS OWN WAY IN A DISPUTE. 
WE DO NOT HEAR, HOWEVER, OF MANY DISPUTES WHICH 
REQUIRE ROYAL SETTLEMENT FROM ABOVE.  WE KNOW OF 
RIVALRIES BUT NOT OPEN INSUBORDINATION.  IT IS 
PROBABLE THAT ANY PRINCE WHO CANNOT GET ALONG IN 
MODA IS QUIETLY MOVED OUT.  WHILE STORIES ABOUND 
AS TO THE ACTUAL REASON, BG FAHD BIN ABDULLAH\'S 
RECENT RETIREMENT WAS REPORTEDLY DUE IN PART TO 
THE PERSONAL POWER HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER RECENT 
YEARS, POWER WHICH SOMETIMES APPEARED TO EXCEED THAT 
OF HIS NOMINAL BOSS, THE RSAF COMMANDER.  (WHETHER 
OR NOT THIS PROMPTED HIS PROMOTION/REMOVAL IS UNCLEAR. 
MOST OBSERVERS AGREE HIS COMING IS AT LEAST A BENEFIT 
TO CIVIL AVIATION AND A TECHNICAL PROMOTION.) 
 
27.  BUT TIGHT MILITARY DISCIPLINE IS NOT REALLY IN 
THE SAUDI TRADITION--FOR COMMONERS AS WELL AS ROYALTY. 
SAUDI SOCIETY REMAINS CLOSE TO THE STRONG BEDOUIN 
ETHIC OF FIERCE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE AND STRONG, 
FAMILY/CLAN ORIENTED LOYALTY.  WHILE NOT OBVIOUS, 
EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING HAS ITS PLACE IN THE ORDER 
OF IMPORTANCE.  LOYALTY IS FIRST TO ONE\'S FATHER 
AND THEN TO A LESSER DEGREE, TO OTHER PERSONS, 
INSTITUTIONS AND PURSUITS.  IN THE ARMED FORCES, 
THIS HAS RESULTED IN THE REDUCTION OF WHAT ARE 
ELSEWHERE STRICT MILITARY REGULATIONS INTO THE 
LEAST RESTRICTIVE, LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. 
WESTERN CONCEPTS OF MILILARY DISCIPLINE AS APPLIED 
IN THE SAUDI ARABIAN ARMED FORCES ARE LIBERAL, 
AND TO OUTSIDERS OFTEN SEEM PATENTLY INEFFECTIVE. 
SOLDIERS ON GUARD DUTY CAN BE SEEN WITHOUT LACES 
IN THEIR SHOES OR OUT OF PROPER UNIFORM IN SOME 
OTHER WAY.  ALTHOUGH FORBIDDEN BY REGULATIONS, 
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS CAN STILL BE SEEN LEAVING 
THEIR OFFICES AT 2:00 PM (DAY\'S END) AND GETTING 
INTO  THEIR TAXI CABS TO BEGIN A SECOND OCCUPATION. 
 
28.  DESPITE OFFICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTS TO THE CONTRARY, 
WITH NO EQUALITY BETWEEN PRINCES AND OFFICERS OF EQUAL 
RANK, LARGE DISPARITY IN PAY AND ALLOWANCES (PRINCES 
GET A ROYAL STIPEND OF AROUND USD 120,000 PER YEAR, 
DEPENDING ON PLACE IN THE FAMILY), AND A VAST ARRAY 
OF PREREQUISITES SUCH AS FREE USE OF GOVERNMENT OWNED 
AIRCRAFT, HOMES, ETC., IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THEY 
ARE RELATIVELY ISOLATED FROM THEIR COMMONER COLLEAGUES 
WITHIN THE MILITARY.  PRINCES ASSOCIATE VERY LITTLE 
OUTSIDE THEIR OWN CIRCLES, BUT THIS INDEED IS THE 
CASE WITH FAMILIES IN THE REST OF SAUDI SOCIETY. 
HOWEVER, WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE ARMED FORCES IS THAT 
THE BONDS OF COMRADESHIP ARE VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT. 
WHILE PRINCES HAVE, THROUGH THEIR PERSONAL CONNECTIONS, 
THE ABILITY TO EXERT PRESSURE ON BEHALF OF THEIR UNITS, 
INFLUENCE IS THE WAY VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IS MOVED IN 
THE SAUDI BUREAUCRACY AND NOT MUCH CREDIT IS GIVEN FOR 
DOING SOMETHING WHICH IS EXPECTED.  THE PRESENCE OF A 
PRINCE IN THE UNIT IS THEREFORE NOT NECESSARILY A 
BOON TO MORALE. 
 
29.  THE MISSION IS AWARE OF COMPLAINTS AMONG COMMONER 
OFFICERS ABOUT THE OBVIOUS PRIVILEGES AND EXCESSIVE 
GREED OF ROYAL FAMILY MEMBERS.  THERE HAS ALSO BEEN 
QUIET GRUMBLING ABOUT EXCESSIVE ADVANCEMENT, SUCH AS 
IN THE CASE OF CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S SON MITIEB. 
WHILE OFFICERS WILL MOST GENERALLY WITHHOLD THEIR 
COMMENTS FROM FOREIGNERS, THE FACT THAT A FEW HAVE 
BEEN WILLING TO SPEAK IS PROBABLY INDICATIVE OF WIDER, 
PRIVATE ATTITUDES IN THE OFFICER CORPS.  (THERE IS 
NO PROVISION FOR COMPLAINTS SUCH AS THESE AND THEREFORE, 
IF THEY ARE WIDESPREAD, THEY ARE PROBABLY VOICED ONLY 
AMONG CONFIDANTS.  WE KNOW OF CASES IN WHICH OFFICERS 
WITH OUTSPOKEN OPINIONS HAVE BEEN MOVED TO ATTACHE 
POSITIONS OUT OF THE COUNTRY, BEEN GIVEN RETIREMENT, 
OR BEEN SECONDED TO NON-MILITARY, GOVERNMENTAL 
ORGANIZATIONS.)  PERHAPS THE EVIDENCE OF CAUTION 
OF MOVING PRINCES TO THE MOST SENIOR POSITIONS 
INDICATES SOME ROYAL FAMILY AWARENESS OF THE POTENTIAL 
PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF OFFICER CORPS MORALE IF THEIR 
OWN ARE PUSHED TOO FAR.  THE SANG APPEARS TO BE LESS 
AFFECTED THAN MODA AND MORE RELAXED ABOUT THE PRINCELY 
ROLE. 
 
30.  OVERALL, PRINCES DO NOT APPEAR TO HELP OR HARM 
THE CAPABILITY OF THE ARMED FORCES.  WHILE IT IS 
DEBATABLE HOW MUCH THEIR EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
AFFECT MORALE, THEIR ABILITY TO  CUT THROUGH RED 
TAPE AND FACILITATE MATTERS ON BEHALF OF THEIR UNITS 
SHOULD HELP OFFSET AT LEAST ANY NEGATIVE FEELINGS. 
WHILE SOME MAY COME IN FOR CRITICISM, THE PROVEN 
ABILITY OF OTHERS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN RECOGNIZED AND 
LEADERS SUCH AS COL. MITIEB, OVERALL, ARE RESPECTED 
BY THEIR COLLEAGUES AND SUBORDINATES.  HOWEVER, THE 
FINANCIAL ADVANTAGES WHICH ONCE FELL TO EVERYONE 
WITH A LITTLE IMAGINATION ARE DWINDLING FAST.  SOON, 
THE CASE MAY BE THAT ONLY PRINCES WILL HAVE THE CLOUT, 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND OPERATING LATITUDE TO MAKE 
IT RICH.  IF THIS OCCURS, THEIR PLACE IN THE MILITARY 
MAY BECOME MORE CONTROVERSIAL. 
 
31.  THE MERE PRESENCE OF PRINCES IN THE ARMED FORCES 
PROVIDES SOME DEGREE OF STABILITY TO THE AL SAUD 
REGIME.  REGARDLESS OF THEIR MOTIVES IN ENTERING 
THE MILITARY, THEIR OVERSIGHT CAPABILITY AND 
INFLUENCE ON EVENTS IN THE MILITARY MUST INEVITABLY 
HAVE SOME EFFECT ON UNIT PERSONNEL.  AND INEVITABLY, 
EVEN IF LINKS TO THE SENIOR PRINCES ARE WEAK, THERE 
MUST BE SOME FEEDBACK ON MILITARY ATTITUDES FROM 
THE PRINCELY PRESENCE.  WHETHER OR NOT A PRINCE 
IMPROVES OR DETRACTS FROM THE MORALE OR CAPABILITY 
OF HIS UNIT IS MORE OR LESS DEPENDENT ON HIS ATTITUDE 
TOWARD THE PROFESSION AND HIS PERSONAL INTERESTS. 
HOWEVER, HIS PRIMARY BENEFIT TO THE REGIME, WHETHER 
BY DESIGN OR NOT, IS THE ROYAL PRESENCE HIS ASSIGNMENT 
BRINGS.

1.  (U)  IN JUNE 10 \"ASHARQ AL-AWSAT\" INTERVIEW IN 
TUNIS, FON MIN SAUD AL-FAISAL TALKED ABOUT THE 
ARAB LEAGUE FOREIGN MINISTERS\' MEETING ON LEBANON. 
REFERRING TO KING FAHD\'S PREVIOUS EXPRESSION OF 
DISGUST AND DISMAY AT EVENTS AT THE PALESTINIAN 
CAMPS IN LEBANON, HE SAID HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED 
TO EXPRESS HOPE THAT ALL STATES WOULD WORK TO HALT 
BLOODSHED AND BRING ABOUT RECONCILIATION.  HE 
ASSERTED THAT MEETING HAD REACHED A RESOLUTION TO 
END THE BLOODSHED AND HOPED THE LEBANESE GOVERN- 
MENT WOULD COOPERATE IN IMPLEMENTING IT.  HE ADDED 
THAT ALL LEBANESE PARTIES HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO 
EXERT EVERY EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT AN IMMEDIATE 
CEASEFIRE. 
- 
2.  (U)  IN JUNE 10 EDITORIAL, \"AL-RIYADH\" 
IS IMPLICITLY CRITICAL OF THE MEETING BY NOTING 
THAT THE RESOLUTION PRODUCED WAS THE MINIMUM 
EXPECTED. IT IMPLIED DISAPPROVAL OF INEFFECTIVE 
CONCILIATORY RESOLUTIONS AND OF THE ARAB WORLD FOR 
NOT DOING MORE TO PREVENT THE PALESTINIANS FROM 
BECOMING VICTIMS.  \"AL-NADWA,\" THE MOST VOCALLY 
PRO-PALESTINIAN OF THE SAUDI PAPERS, MENTIONED 
IN JUNE 8 EDITORIAL THAT SOME STATES WILL BOYCOTT 
THE MEETING HELD TO DISCUSS THE WAR OF THE CAMPS 
\"WAGED BY THE AMAL MILITIAS.\"  IT ALSO CALLED FOR 
EFFECTIVE ACTION AND FOR THE COUNCIL TO STAND 
FIRMLY AGAINST THE ATTACKS.  JUNE 9 \"AL-NADWA\" 
EDITORIAL IS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF NABIH BERRI. 
- 
3.  (U)  KING FAHD HIMSELF SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED 
ANOTHER STATEMENT ON THE PALESTINIAN SITUATION 
IN LEBANON.  JUNE 11 PRESS REPORTS THAT AT CON- 
CLUSION OF EVENING CABINET MEETING JUNE 10, AT 
WHICH SAUD REPORTED ON THE RESULTS OF THE TUNIS 
MEETING, MIN INFO ALI SHAIR READ A STATEMENT IN 
WHICH THE KING AFFIRMED SAUDI ARABIA\'S CONCERN FOR 
THE SAFETY OF THE PALESTINIAN REFUGEES IN THE 
LEBANON CAMPS.  FURTHER, SAUDI ARABIA WOULD 
ATTEND ANY ARAB MEETING WHICH WOULD SERVE THE 
PALESTINIAN CAUSE AND FIND SOLUTIONS TO STOP THE 
KILLING IN LEBANON. 
- 
4.  (C)  COMMENT:  SAUD\'S REMARKS PUT THE SAUDIS\' 
CALL TO END THE BLOODSHED ONCE MORE ON RECORD. 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAUD\'S PRESENCE AT THE MEETING 
AND SAUDI SUPPORT FOR THE RESOLUTION SHOW SAUDI 
ARABIA ONCE MORE SUPPORTING THE LEADERSHIP ROLE 
OF ARAFAT DESPITE SYRIAN OPPOSITION.  (WE NOTE 
FROM REFTEL SAUD CONFERRED WITH ARAFAT IN TUNIS.) 
ALTHOUGH NO EDITORIALS MENTIONED SYRIA BY NAME, 
ONLY THE AMAL AND BERRI, UNHAPPINESS WITH SYRIA 
IS PROBABLY NOT FAR BELOW THE SURFACE.  INDEED, 
WE HAVE HEARD THAT ASAD HAS BEEN ROUNDLY 
CRITICIZED BY PALESTINIANS AND SAUDIS ON THE 
LOCAL MAJLIS CIRCUIT FOR NOT RESTRAINING THE 
SHI\'ITE ATTACKS AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN CAMPS.

1.  S - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  EVENTS AND PASSAGE OF TIME HAVE COM- 
BINED TO MITIGATE SAUDI FEARS AND HOPES REGARDING 
IRAN.  MORE CONFIDENT NOW THAT IRAQ WILL NOT BE 
DEFEATED, THAT THERE IS LESS DANGER OF A DIRECT 
IRANIAN ATTACK ON SAUDI ARABIA, THAT THE LIKELI- 
HOOD OF EFFECTIVE IRANIAN-INSPIRED SUBVERSION IN 
SAUDI ARABIA IS NOW SMALL, AND THAT THE DANGER OF 
SUBVERSION IN OTHER GULF COUNTRIES IS PROBABLY 
CONTAINABLE, THE SAG HAS GROWN COMFORTABLE WITH 
THE IRAQI STRATEGY OF ATTEMPTING TO FORCE IRAN 
TOWARD THE NEGOTIATING TABLE THROUGH MILITARY, 
ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE THAT, OVER TIME, 
MAY CONVINCE THE IRANIANS THAT THEY HAVE NO 
ALTERNATIVE.  THE SAG DISTRUSTS IRAN AS MUCH AS 
THE IRAQIS DO AND DOES NOT BEAR THE DIRECT BURDEN 
OF CONTAINING ITS REVOLUTION; THUS SAUDI PATIENCE 
IS IN FACT GREATER THAN THAT OF IRAQ.  THE SAG FULLY 
ACCEPTS IRAQ\'S ANALYSES OF THE WAR AND THE SITUATION 
IN IRAN AND IS GIVING IRAQ FULL DIPLOMATIC BACKING, 
INCLUDING IN ITS RECENT CONTACTS WITH IRAN.  THE 
MESSAGE THE SAG IS SENDING IRAN IS THAT THE 
SAUDIS CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM IRAQ WHILE THE 
CONFLICT LASTS, BUT THAT THEY WISH TO REMAIN IN 
CONTACT WITH IRAN AND HOPE FOR A COOPERATIVE RELA- 
TIONSHIP ONCE IRAN CEASES TO PURSUE ITS GOALS 
ABROAD BY MILITARY MEANS.  THE CHIEF SAG POLICY- 
MAKERS, IN THIS AS IN OTHER FIELDS, ARE PROBABLY 
FAHD, ABDULLAH, SULTAN, AND NAIF, AND THERE DO NOT 
APPEAR TO BE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THEM.  THEY 
RECOGNIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL, THEOLOGICAL HOSTILITY 
OF THE IRANIAN REGIME AND UNDERSTAND THAT UNTIL THE 
REVOLUTION HAS BEEN BLUNTED AND ITS NATURE SIGNIFI- 
CANTLY TRANSFORMED, IT WILL REPRESENT A THREAT TO 
THE AL SAUD.  THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BE FIRM 
IN DEFENSE OF WHAT IS THEIRS, LEST IRAN ESCALATE 
ITS THREATS, AS SHOWN IN LAST SUMMER\'S SHOOTDOWN 
OF AT LEAST ONE IRANIAN AIRCRAFT AND SUBSEQUENT 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF RSAF RULES OF ENGAGEMENT.  THEY 
HAVE NOT ABANDONED THEIR  TRADITIONAL CAUTION, 
HOWEVER, AND CONTINUE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY 
INTEND NO AGGRESSIVE THREAT TO IRAN, AS SHOWN IN 
THEIR CONCILIATORY STANCE AFTER THE AIRCRAFT 
SHOOTDOWN.  THEY ARE ACUTELY AWARE, TOO, OF THE 
LONG-TERM NEED FOR A DECENT WORKING RELATIONSHIP 
WITH IRAN, AND HOPE THAT OVER TIME THE REVOLUTION 
WILL MODERATE AND SHARED INTERESTS WILL ASSERT 
THEMSELVES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  A NUMBER OF FACTORS HAVE SHIFTED, EITHER WITH 
EVENTS OR THE MERE PASSAGE OF TIME, SINCE OUR LAST 
OVERALL LOOK AT SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS (REFTEL). 
THE NET RESULT HAS BEEN INCREASED SAUDI CONFIDENCE 
AND LESS SHARP SAUDI SWINGS BETWEEN FEARS AND HOPES. 
PRINCIPAL CHANGES INCLUDE:  (A) CONTINUING CON- 
FIRMATION OF IRAQI ABILITY TO HOLD THE IRANIANS ON 
THE GROUND; (B) THE GROWING RELATIVE STRENGTH OF 
THE IRAQI AIR FORCE AND NAVY; (C) THE \"SANCTIFYING\" 
OF A BROAD RSAF AIR DEFENSE ZONE IMPLICIT IN THE 
ABSENCE OF IRANIAN ATTACKS IN THE NORTHERN GULF 
SINCE THE SAUDI SHOOTDOWN LAST JUNE OF AN IRANIAN 
F-4 OR TWO (THOUGH IRAN MAY BE MOUNTING A NEW TEST 
ON THIS FRONT); (D) DEVELOPMENT OF SOME SKEPTICISM 
ABOUT ALLEGED \"FAVORABLE TRENDS\" IN IRAN, FOLLOWING 
GREATER EXPERIENCE WITH IRANIAN PLOYS DESIGNED TO 
DISTANCE GCC COUNTRIES FROM IRAQ OR TO GAIN GREATER 
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT OR SYMPATHY BY APPEARING 
\"REASONABLE\" ON SUCH HUMANITARIAN QUESTIONS AS 
BOMBING CITIES (WHILE REFUSING TO DISCUSS A GENERAL 
SETTLEMENT); (E) THE DULLING OF THE ALLURE OF 
IRAN\'S REVOLUTION AS THE STALEMATE CONTINUES AND 
APPEARS INCREASINGLY UNFAVORABLE TO IRAN; (F) 
THE APPOINTMENT OF A DYNAMIC NEW RULING-FAMILY 
GOVERNOR IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE; (G) THE APPARENT 
FIRMING OF KUWAITI RESOLVE (BUT INCREASED CONCERN 
ABOUT THE UAE AND, PERHAPS, OMAN); AND (H) THE CHANGING 
FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP AS COMPLETION OF IRAQ\'S MAJOR 
NEW/EXPANDED PIPELINES NEARS.

FEARS AND HOPES

4.  IT HAS NOT BEEN LONG SINCE A LITTLE BAD NEWS-- 
AN IRANIAN OFFENSIVE OR A FEW IRANIAN OR IRAQI 
ATTACKS ON SHIPPING--WOULD SEND THE SAG INTO A 
MOMENTARY NEAR-PANIC, IN WHICH IT WOULD RAISE SUCH 
QUESTIONS AS WHAT \"MILITARY MOVES\" THE USG MIGHT 
MAKE TO HELP ASSURE SECURITY IN THE GULF.  THIS 
IS NO LONGER TRUE.  THE SAUDIS, REPORTEDLY ALONG 
WITH OTHER GCC OFFICIALS ATTENDING THE MARCH 1985 
GCC MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE, CERTAINLY EXPERIENCED 
UNEASY MOMENTS DURING THE RECENT IRANIAN OFFENSIVE 
IN THE HAWAIZAH MARSHES, AND HAD THE IRAQIS BROKEN, 
WOULD HAVE SEEN THEMSELVES BACK IN THE BAD OLD 
DAYS OF 1982-83, WITH THEIR WORST FEARS ALL BUT 
REALIZED.  AS THE IRAQIS DID NOT BREAK, HOWEVER, 
SUCH FEARS HAVE RECEDED AND THE BASIS FOR SAUDI 
CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN REAFFIRMED. 
 
5.  THE SAUDIS\' \"WORST FEARS,\" OF COURSE, ENTAIL 
A VISION OF A TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTIONARY IRAN LOOMING 
MENACINGLY OVER KUWAIT AND OVER SAUDI ARABIA 
ITSELF.  ITS OTHER FEARS INCLUDE A DIRECT IRANIAN 
ATTACK OF SOME SORT, AN ESCALATION THAT WOULD 
DRAW SAUDI ARABIA OR SMALLER GULF COUNTRIES INTO 
THE WAR, IRANIAN-DIRECTED SUBVERSION AGAINST 
SAUDI ARABIA, AND IRANIAN-DIRECTED SUBVERSION 
AGAINST ONE OR MORE OF THE SMALLER GULF STATES. 
ALL OF THESE FEARS HAVE DIMINISHED, WITH THE 
PARTIAL EXCEPTION OF FEARS ABOUT SUBVERSION. 
 
6.  THE RISK OF ESCALATION, TOO, HAS GROWN LESS 
FEARSOME.  IRAN HAS RESPECTED THE SAUDI-DECLARED 
AIR DEFENSE ZONES SINCE SAUDI F-15\'S SHOOT DOWN 
AN IRANIAN F-4 LAST JUNE.  THIS FACT HAS EASED 
SAUDI FEARS AND INCREASED SAUDI CONFIDENCE IN 
THEIR ABILITY TO DETER DIRECT IRANIAN ATTACKS. 
THIS REMAINS TRUE DESPITE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF THE SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUS JUNE 1 
ATTACK ON THE CONTAINER VESSEL \"ORIENTAL IMPORTER\" 
IN THE NORTHERN GULF, AND SPECULATION IN INDUSTRY 
CIRCLES THAT IF THE ATTACK REPRESENTS A NEW 
TURN IN IRANIAN TACTICS, IT MAY BRING A NEW 
CONFRONTATION BETWEEN IRANIAN AIRCRAFT AND THE RSAF. 
THE SAUDIS HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS UPS AND DOWNS IN THE 
TANKER WAR, AND HAVE SEEN THE TANKER WAR ATTACKS 
SETTLE INTO A PATTERN OF IRAQI ATTACKS SOUTH OF 
KHARG AND IRANIAN REPRISALS EAST OF QATAR, OUTSIDE 
THE ZONE COVERED BY RSAF CAPS.  IN THESE ZONES 
ATTACK FREQUENCY MAY WAX AND WANE, BUT THE SAG NO 
LONGER GREATLY FEARS THAT THESE ATTACKS WILL 
ESCALATE OR SPREAD THE CONFLICT. IT HAS ALSO SEEN 
THAT THE EFFECTS ON AVAILABILITY OF VESSELS IN THE 
GULF AND ON INSURANCE RATES ARE FAR LESS DRASTIC 
THAN PREVIOUSLY FEARED.  THE SAG WAS ANNOYED AND 
PUZZLED BY IRAQI ATTACKS IN MARCH IN THE VICINITY 
OF RAS TANURA LIGHT, BUT APPARENTLY TOOK THIS UP 
WITH BAGHDAD AND WAS SATISFIED WITH THE RESPONSE. 
IF IRAN DOES MOUNT FURTHER ATTACKS IN THE AREA OF 
THE ATTACK ON THE \"ORIENTAL IMPORTER,\" WE BELIEVE 
THE RSAF WOULD AGAIN ATTEMPT TO RESPOND, AND THAT 
A SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE WOULD PROBABLY BRING A HALT 
IN THE NEW IRANIAN ATTACKS.  IF THE RSAF SHOULD 
INITIALLY FAIL, OF COURSE, THE GULF COULD SEE SOME 
TENSE DAYS. 
 
7.  IRANIAN-DIRECTED OR INSPIRED SUBVERSION AGAINST 
SAUDI ARABIA, WHILE IT REPRESENTS A POSSIBILITY THAT 
WILL NEVER BE TREATED LIGHTLY HERE, NEVERTHELESS 
NO LONGER AMOUNTS TO A BUGABOO, THOUGHTS OF WHICH 
AWAKEN SAUDI LEADERS AT NIGHT.  THE FIRM, NOT 
TO SAY BRUTAL, HANDLING OF THE 1979 DISTURBANCES 
IN QATIF AND AL-HASA, CONTINUING CLOSE SURVEILLANCE 
OF THE SHI\'A, CLEAR WARNINGS OF THE REACTION THAT 
MAY BE ANTICIPATED TO FUTURE DISTURBANCES, SOME- 
TIME TRAVEL CONTROLS ON SHI\'A, AND OCCASIONAL 
ARRESTS ALL GIVE SAUDI AUTHORITIES CONFIDENCE 
THAT THEY HAVE THE SITUATION WELL IN HAND.  THE 
STICK BEING HIGHLY VISIBLE, THE SAG HAS BROUGHT 
FORTH A FEW CARROTS OF LATE, DEVOTING SOME 
RESOURCES TO IMPROVING THE LOT OF THE EASTERN 
PROVINCE SHI\'A.  IT APPEARS LIKELY THAT NEW 
EASTERN PROVINCE AMIR MUHAMMAD IBN FAHD, HAVING 
MADE AN EARLY AND FAVORABLY RECEIVED OPENING 
TO THE SHI\'A, WILL ATTEMPT TO COME UP WITH MORE 
CARROTS.  NEITHER STICKS NOR CARROTS HAVE 
GREAT MEANING, OF COURSE, TO SHI\'A IN LOVE WITH 
MARTYRDOM, BUT EVIDENCE IS LACKING THAT MORE THAN 
A FEW IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE SHARE THIS DEGREE 
OF FANATICISM WITH THEIR IRANIAN CO-RELIGIONISTS. 
THE SAG SUSPECTS, OF COURSE, A DIRECT OR INDIRECT 
IRANIAN HAND IN THE TWO RECENT EXPLOSIONS IN 
RIYADH, AND IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF 
SUCH INCIDENTS ON THE SENSE OF  SECURITY THAT IS 
CONSIDERED, BY SAUDIS AND EXPATRIATES ALIKE, A 
MAJOR BENEFIT OF (OR COMPENSATION FOR) LIFE IN 
SAUDI ARABIA. 
- 
8.  THE ANNUAL HAJJ OF COURSE PROVIDES THE OTHER 
SOURCE OF SAUDI ANXIETY ABOUT IRANIAN TROUBLEMAKING. 
THE SAUDIS GAINED MUCH CONFIDENCE LAST YEAR WHEN 
THEY HANDLED 150,000 IRANIAN PILGRIMS WITH CON- 
SIDERABLE SUCCESS.  THE SINGLE MAJOR INCIDENT, 
A FRACAS BETWEEN IRANIAN AND IRAQI PILGRIMS, WAS 
HANDLED WITH DESPATCH, AND THE SAUDIS FIRMLY 
REJECTED IRAN\'S PROTEST AND OFFERED THEIR OWN 
PUBLIC ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS.  NEVERTHELESS, HAJJ 
SECURITY DEEPLY CONCERNS THE SAG, AND IT IS MAKING 
PREPARATIONS TO HANDLE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE 
ANTICIPATED.  NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE SIZE OF THIS 
YEAR\'S IRANIAN HAJJ INFLUX HAVE, ACCORDING TO SIRO, 
BEEN CONCLUDED, AND THE NUMBER OF IRANIAN PILGRIMS 
AGAIN SET AT 150,000.  SAUDI SECURITY OFFICIALS 
UNDOUBTEDLY URGED THAT THE NUMBERS BE KEPT DOWN. 
THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP MAY HAVE DECIDED TO SEEK, 
THROUGH AGREEING TO RECEIVE A LARGER NUMBER, 
IMPLICITLY TO PUT THE LIE TO IRANIAN CHARGES 
THAT THE AL SAUD ARE UNWORTHY CUSTODIANS OF THE 
HOLY CITIES.  WERE A PROMINENT CLERIC TO AGREE 
TO HEAD THE OFFICIAL IRANIAN DELEGATION, THAT 
MESSAGE WOULD BE UNDERSCORED. 
 
9.  THE POSSIBILITY OF IRANIAN SHENANIGANS IN THE 
SMALL STATES OF THE GULF CONTINUES TO HAUNT THE 
SAUDI OFFICIAL PSYCHE.  THERE WAS GREAT CONCERN 
HERE, OF COURSE, ABOUT THE BAHRAIN PLOT DISCOVERED 
IN DECEMBER OF 1982, AND ALSO ABOUT THE PLOT IN 
QATAR IN THE SUMMER OF 1983 (THOUGH THERE WERE 
SUGGESTIONS, AS WE RECALL, THAT THAT MAY HAVE 
INVOLVED LIBYAN ADVENTURISM).  CONTINUING CONCERN 
ABOUT THE STEADFASTNESS OF THE KUWAITI AUTHORITIES 
HAS BEEN ASSUAGED SOMEWHAT BY KUWAIT\'S RESPONSE 
TO THE DECEMBER 1983 BOMBINGS AND THE HIJACKING 
LATE LAST YEAR, AND BY WHAT IS PERCEIVED HERE AS 
KUWAIT\'S GENERALLY FIRMER SECURITY POLICY, 
INCLUDING ITS INCREASED INTEREST IN GCC MILITARY 
COOPERATION.  (SIRO NOTES THAT THE SAG ADVISED 
THE GOK EITHER TO EXECUTE THE PRISONERS IT HELD 
IN CONNECTION WITH THE DECEMBER 1983 BOMBINGS OR 
TO LET THEM GO, TO AVOID FUTURE PROBLEMS.) 
IRAN IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE IMPLICATED, 
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE RECENT ATTEMPT ON 
THE LIFE OF THE AMIR OF KUWAIT.  THE SAG LEADERSHIP 
SEEMED SHOCKED BY THIS ATTEMPT, GUT IN RETROSPECT 
APPEARS RELIEVED THAT THE SHOCK ADMINISTERED TO 
KUWAIT\'S BODY POLITIC IS PROVING A SALUTARY ONE, 
FURTHER FIRING KUWAITI DETERMINATION TO STRENGTHEN 
ITS SECURITY.  THE SAG APPEARS SOMEWHAT CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE POLITICAL DRIFT IN THE UAE AND THE 
INCREASED IRANIAN ACTIVITY THERE. 
 
10.  SAUDI HOPES CONCERNING POSSIBLE POSITIVE 
DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN, NEVER GREAT, ARE NOW VERY 
MODEST INDEED.  THE SAUDIS HAVE EXPERIENCED 
OCCASIONAL SURGES OF HOPE ABOUT APPEARANCES OF 
RELATIVE MODERATION AND REASONABLENESS IN IRAN, 
AND THE NEED TO NURTURE ANY SEEDS OF SUCH MODERA- 
TION.  THIS OCCURRED, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER LAVASANI\'S 
VISIT LAST SUMMER.  BUT THESE HOPES HAVE TURNED 
TO DUST.  THE SAUDIS SAW IRAN APPEAR TO STIMULATE 
A GCC INITIATIVE LAST SUMMER AND THEN HOLD BACK. 
THEY ALSO SAW JAPAN STIMULATED BY IRANIAN OFFICIALS 
TO TAKE A SPECIFIC INITIATIVE WHICH IRAN THEN 
REBUFFED.  THE IRAQIS PREDICTED THIS FAILURE.  THE 
SAUDIS FIRST BELIEVED THE IRAQI ANALYSIS AND THEN 
SAW IT CONFIRMED.  IT IS NOT THAT THE SAUDIS SEE NO 
SIGNS OF MODERATION IN IRAN, BUT RATHER THAT THEY 
NOW SHARE THE IRAQI ANALYSIS THAT THAT MODERATION 
CAN ONLY EXPAND UNDER PRESSURE, MILITARY AND 
DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE THAT OVER TIME MAY CONVINCE 
THE IMMODERATE MAJORITY OF IRANIAN LEADERS THAT 
THEIR INTRANSIGENCE IS LEADING ONLY TO INCREASING 
FAILURE:  PRESSURE, IN OTHER WORDS, THAT IN TIME 
MAY PROVE THE MODERATES CORRECT.  FURTHERMORE, 
THE SAUDIS UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A VERY LONG ROAD 
INDEED FROM IRAN\'S PRESENT FUNDAMENTAL, THEOLOGICAL 
HOSTILITY TO THE AL SAUD REGIME TO A DEGREE OF 
MODERATION THAT WOULD MAKE IRAN A TOLERABLY SAFE 
NEIGHBOR.  THUS, THEY SUFFER LITTLE TEMPTATION 
TO GRASP AT STRAWS. 
 
11.  THE SAG, WE BELIEVE, NOW SHARES ALL BUT TOTALLY 
THE IRAQI ANALYSIS OF THE IRANIAN SITUATION AND OF 
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT SITUATION FOR BOTH IRAQI 
AND SAUDI POLICY.  WE DETECT NO DAYLIGHT, FOR 
EXAMPLE, BETWEEN SAUD\'S LINE ON THE WAR AND THAT 
OF TARIQ AZIZ.  THE FORMER HAS IN RECENT MONTHS 
PRESSED FOR CONTINUED AND INCREASED U.S. EFFORTS 
TO STANCH ARMS FLOW TO IRAN AND HAS MADE SUCH 
EFFORTS HIMSELF.  HE HAS ALSO BRUSHED ASIDE 
EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT ESCALATION ARISING 
FROM THE SHIPPING WAR, ARGUING THAT THE IRAQIS 
MUST KEEP UP THE PRESSURE ON IRAN. 
 
-------- 
PATIENCE 
-------- 
 
12.  WITH THIS LOWERING OF HOPES AND FEARS, SAUDI 
POLICY TOWARD IRAN IS CHARACTERIZED BY GREATER 
PATIENCE.  THE IRAQIS HAVE CONVINCED THE SAG THAT 
PATIENT APPLICATION OF PRESSURE IS THE ONLY WAY 
TO END THE WAR.  IN THIS SITUATION, WITH THE IRAQIS 
BEARING THE DIRECT BURDEN, SAUDI PATIENCE--A 
DOMINANT CHARACTER TRAIT FROM EARLY TIMES--HAS 
COME TO THE FORE.  THE SAG DOES NOT SEE THE WAR 
AS RISK-FREE, OF COURSE, AND WOULD PREFER TO SEE 
IT EDGE TOWARD NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT.  EVEN A 
SMALL POSSIBILITY OF CONFLAGRATION, AFTER ALL, 
DISCOMFITS SAUDIS INTENSELY.  STILL, AS THE THREAT 
APPEARS TO BE CONTAINED AND TO BE LOSING FORCE, THE 
SAUDIS CAN RAISE THEIR HEADS AND SEE THAT ALL IS 
NOT GRIM.  A SOLUTION IS ESSENTIAL, BUT THE SAG 
IS NOT EAGER, FOR EXAMPLE, TO SEE AN EARLY RETURN 
OF LARGE VOLUMES OF IRANIAN AND IRAQI OIL TO THE 
WORLD MARKET.  WE BELIEVE THE SAUDIS SEE GRADUAL 
MOVEMENT TOWARD PEACE AS PREFERABLE TO AN EARLY 
FRAGILE SETTLEMEN1 OR TO CONFLICT CONTINUED AT THE 
CURRENT LEVEL.  AN IRAQ FREE OF THE WAR WITH IRAN, 
FURTHERMORE, COULD REPRESENT A GREATER THREAT TO 
THE SAUDIS AND THEIR GCC BRETHREN.  HOWEVER, WE 
BELIEVE THE SAG WOULD CONCUR IN EMBASSY BAGHDAD\'S 
INSIGHT THAT IRAQ IS NOT LIKELY TO SEEK TO ASSERT 
INFLUENCE THROUGH A RETURN TO SUBVERSION OR 
TERRORISM, SINCE IRAN WOULD BE THE MORE LIKELY 
BENEFICIARY OF INSTABILITY IN THE GULF STATES. 
 
--- 
OIL 
--- 
 
13.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES 
SAUDI OIL POLICY IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY 
CONCERN FOR ITS RELATIONS WITH IRAN, NOR THAT 
SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS IN THE ENERGY FIELD ARE 
CURRENTLY A VITAL OR MAJOR COMPONENT OF OVERALL 
RELATIONS.  WHILE THE PRICE OF OIL USED TO BE 
(OR AT LEAST APPEAR TO BE) A BONE OF CONTENTION 
BETWEEN SAUDIS AND IRANIANS, BOTH BEFORE AND 
AFTER THE REVOLUTION, THIS IS NOW A MINOR THEME. 
SAUDI ACCEPTANCE OF MOST OF THE BURDEN OF THE 
CURRENT SLACK MARKET APPEARS TO HAVE EARNED A 
MEASURE OF GRUDGING IRANIAN APPRECIATION, DESPITE 
OCCASIONAL IRANIAN GRUMBLING ABOUT LOWER PRICES 
AND ABOUT SAUDI RELUCTANCE TO CARRY THE WHOLE 
BURDEN.  THE SAUDIS, HOWEVER, FOLLOW THIS 
POLICY NOT TO EARN IRANIAN KUDOS, BUT BECAUSE 
THEY PERCEIVE IT AS THE LEAST DAMAGING IN TERMS 
OF THEIR OWN CONCERNS ABOUT SHORT- AND LONG-TERM 
REVENUES AND ABOUT THE PRESERVATION OF OPEC.  IT IS 
A MEASURE OF THE LOW PROFILE OF OIL POLICY IN 
BILATERAL RELATIONS THAT DURING HIS MAY 8 VISIT TO 
RIYADH, IRANIAN MINISTER FOR OIL AND OLYMPICS 
GHAFURI-FARD MET WITH FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD AND 
WITH DEFENSE MINISTER SULTAN, BUT DID NOT MEET WITH 
YAMANI.  IRAN IS DOUBTLESS ANGERED AND FRUSTRATED 
BY SAUDI ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ IN THE FORM OF OIL 
EXPORTED ON IRAQI ACCOUNT AND PERMISSION TO BUILD 
AN OIL PIPELINE CONNECTING IRAQ\'S SOUTHERN FIELDS 
TO THE SAUDI EAST-WEST PIPELINE, WHICH MAY IN 
TIME CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER WEAKENING OF THE MARKET. 
HOWEVER, GIVEN IRAN\'S FUNDAMENTAL HOSTILITY TO THE 
SAUDI MONARCHY, IRANIAN IRRITATION IN THIS RESPECT 
IS A MARGINAL CONSIDERATION THAT APPEARS TO HAVE 
HAD LITTLE VISIBLE EFFECT ON EITHER SAUDI OR 
IRANIAN ACTIONS.  IN SUM, SAUDI OIL POLICY IS 
NOT DICTATED BY CONCERN ABOUT EARNING THE GRATITUDE 
OR THE HOSTILITY OF IRAN, BUT RATHER BY CONSIDERA- 
TIONS INVOLVING THE WELFARE OF SAUDI ARABIA AND 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN WHICH 
SAUDI ARABIA HAS INVESTED HEAVILY, AND BY THE 
PERCEIVED NECESSITY OF AIDING IRAQ.  FURTHERMORE, 
THE SAG FULLY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE BASIC HOSTILITY 
OF THE CURRENT IRANIAN REGIME HAS ROOTS DEEPER 
THAN PASSING CONSIDERATIONS OF OIL POLICY. 
 
------ 
POLICY 
------ 
 
14.  THE PRESCRIPTION THAT THE SAUDIS SEE IN ALL 
THIS FOR SAG POLICY TOWARD IRAN IS NOT ONE OF 
ACTIVISM.  THE MESSAGE THEY WISH TO SEND TO IRAN 
IS THAT THEY (AND OTHER GCC STATES) CANNOT BE 
SEPARATED FROM IRAQ WHILE THE WAR LASTS, BUT THAT 
THEY ARE ALWAYS READY TO TALK AND WILL BE READY 
TO IMPROVE RELATIONS AFTER THE WAR ENDS.  THE 
SAUDIS HAVE A SMALL EMBASSY IN TEHRAN--THREE TO 
FOUR OFFICERS AND THEIR WELL-REGARDED CHARGE, 
MARWAN AL-ROUMI.  IRAN HAS ITS SMALL EMBASSY--A 
CHARGE AND THREE OFFICERS, CLOSELY WATCHED--IN 
JEDDAH.  SIRO REPORTS THAT IRAN HAS NOW OBTAINED 
AN EMBASSY BUILDING IN RIYADH, WHERE IT HAS STATIONED 
AT LEAST ONE PERSON SO FAR.  HIGH-LEVEL IRANIAN 
EMISSARIES ARE WELCOMED; SAUD PROMPTLY AGREED TO 
VISIT TEHRAN, WHEN IRAN OFFERED TO RECEIVE HIM 
PUBLICLY, AND HE ISSUED A RECIPROCAL INVITATION 
WHICH VELAYATI HAS NOW ACCEPTED.  SAG POLICYMAKERS 
WITH REGARD TO IRAN AND THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, AS ON ALL 
OTHER SUBJECTS VITAL TO SAUDI ARABIA, ARE THE KING, 
CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH, PRINCE SULTAN, AND PRINCE 
NAIF.  WE HAVE SEEN NO CLEAR EVIDENCE OF IMPORTANT 
DIFFERENCES OF VIEW AMONG THE FOUR OF THEM.  THEY 
APPEAR TO BE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, 
ON THE BASIC HOSTILITY OF THE IRANIAN REGIME AND 
THE THREAT IT CONTINUES TO CONSTITUTE FOR THE 
AL SAUD.  THEY APPEAR AGREED ON THE NEED TO BE FIRM 
BUT NOT FOOLHARDY TOWARD IRAN, AS DEMONSTRATED 
IN LAST SUMMER\'S SHOOTDOWN OF AT LEAST ONE IRANIAN 
F-4, FOLLOWED BY PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RSAF\'S 
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND A CONCILIATORY STANCE 
TOWARD IRAN.  THERE HAVE BEEN HINTS IN THE PAST 
THAT CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH MAY FLIRT WITH THE 
IRANIAN EXILE OPPOSITION, BUT THIS WOULD APPEAR 
LITTLE MORE THAN KEEPING IN TOUCH. 
 
15.  THE SAUDIS WOULD OF COURSE WISH, ON BEHALF ALSO 
OF THEIR GCC ALLIES, TO DISCUSS A BROAD RESOLUTION 
OF THE CONFLICT--NOT LIMITED MEASURES SUCH AS A 
HALT TO BOMBING CITIES OR TANKERS.  THE SAG STANDS 
READY--PREFERABLY THROUGH THE GCC OR THE OIC--TO 
PROMOTE MEDIATION WHENEVER THERE ARE CLEAR SIGNS 
THAT IRANIAN INTRANSIGENCE HAS ABATED SUFFICIENTLY 
TO OFFER SERIOUS HOPE OF PROGRESS.  THEY ARE ALSO 
ACTIVE, OF COURSE, IN URGING OTHERS TO WITHHOLD 
ARMS FROM IRAN OR TO PRESS IRAN TO MOVE TOWARD 
NEGOTIATION.  IN THE MEANTIME, THEY WILL CONTINUE 
SUPPORTING IRAQ FINANCIALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY, 
WHILE MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THEY WISH TO SEE IRAN 
EMERGE FROM THE CONFLICT INTACT AND VIABLE, AND 
THEY MAY BE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE RESOURCES TOWARD 
RECONSTRUCTION, IF THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A 
SETTLEMENT.  SAUDIS WILL NEVER LIKE OR TRUST THE 
IRANIANS--THEY DID NOT DO SO EVEN BEFORE THE REVOLU- 
TION WHEN AT LEAST THEY BELIEVED THERE WERE MAJOR 
SHARED INTERESTS--BUT THEY REMAIN ACUTELY CONSCIOUS 
OF THE LONG-TERM NEED TO LIVE WITH THEIR LARGE AND 
UNRULY NEIGHBOR, AND ARE CONFIDENT THAT, FOR THE 
MOMENT, THEY HAVE FOUND THE BEST FORMULA FOR 
MOVING MATTERS, HOWEVER SLOWLY, IN THAT DIRECTION. 
 
16.  A NUMBER OF FACTORS IN AND ASPECTS OF CURRENT 
SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS MERIT SPECIAL MENTION, AT 
LEAST IN PASSING: 
 
-- LEBANON:  SAG REACTION TO THE GROWTH OF IRANIAN 
INFLUENCE IN LEBANON HAS BEEN FUNDAMENTALLY ONE 
OF CONCERN, TEMPERED BY A MEASURE OF CONFIDENCE 
THAT SYRIA COULD AND WOULD KEEP THE SITUATION FROM 
GETTING OUT OF HAND.  EMOTIONAL REACTIONS OF 
INDIVIDUAL SAUDIS, UP TO AND INCLUDING HIGH 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, HAVE BEEN SHARP AND CON- 
FLICTING.  THE SPECTACLE OF THE \"LEBANESE NATIONAL 
RESISTANCE\" DRIVING THE ISRAELIS FROM SOUTHERN 
LEBANON HAS ACCELERATED PULSES AND SWELLED BREASTS 
AND THE \"BRIDE OF THE SOUTH\" WAS EMBRACED HERE AS A 
TRUE MUSLIM (BUT NOL \"SHI\'A\") AND ARAB HEROINE.  AT 
THE SAME TIME THE GROWING POWER OF LEBANON\'S SHI\'A 
AND HIZBALLAH/ISLAMIC JIHAD TERRORISM HAS BRED 
DISQUIET, WHILE IN RECENT DAYS, AMAL\'S CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN CAMPS HAS ENGAGED SAUDI 
SYMPATHIES FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND REIGNITED 
SMOLDERING SAUDI DISLIKE AND DISTRUST OF THE SHI\'A. 
THE RETURN OF KIDNAPPED SAUDI CONSUL FARRASH AND 
THE EXPLOSION OF TWO BOMBS IN RIYADH AS FOREIGN 
MINISTER SAUD VISITED TEHRAN ARE INEVITABLY READ 
HERE, CORRECTLY OR INCORRECTLY, AS A CRUDE ATTEMPT 
TO SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT IRAN\'S ABILITIES TO REWARD 
OR PUNISH.  IN SHORT, IRAN IN LEBANON IS A SOURCE 
OF CONTINUING BUT CURRENTLY CONFUSED CONCERN HERE. 
 
-- SYRIA:  SYRIA\'S CONTINUED DIPLOMATIC AND LOGIS- 
TICAL SUPPORT FOR IRAN REMAINS A MAJOR FOREIGN 
POLICY PROBLEM FOR THE SAUDIS AND THEIR GCC ALLIES. 
SYRIAN INTRANSIGENCE DESPITE REPEATED SAUDI 
ENTREATIES, NOTABLY BY CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH, 
CONTINUES TO MAKE A MOCKERY OF THE IDEAL OF ARAB 
UNITY; TO ADD TO THE BURDENS IRAQ AND SAUDI ARABIA 
BEAR AS THEY CONFRONT REVOLUTIONARY IRAN; AND 
THROUGH THE SUPPLY OF ARMS (POSSIBLY INCLUDING THE 
TRANSSHIPMENT OF SCUD MISSILES), TO PROLONG THE 
WAR.  ALTHOUGH THE GREATEST IMPEDIMENT TO CONVENING 
THE LONG-OVERDUE ARAB SUMMIT MEETING IN RIYADH IS 
THE DISPUTE OVER THE LEGITIMACY OF ARAFAT\'S LEADER- 
SHIP OF THE PLO (AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE SAUDIS AND 
SYRIANS ARE ALSO IN OPPOSITE CAMPS), SYRIAN 
SUSTENANCE OF THE IRANIAN WAR EFFORT ALSO PRE- 
CLUDES THE HOLDING OF A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT.  THE 
REPEATED POSTPONEMENTS HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY 
AWKWARD FOR THE SAUDIS AND PERSONALLY EMBARRASSING 
TO KING FAHD; ARAB DISARRAY DUE IN PART TO THE 
SYRIAN STANCE TOWARD THE IRAQ/IRAN WAR HAS, FINALLY, 
FURTHER COMPLICATED ARAB EFFORTS TO ELABORATE A 
COMMON STAND VIS-A-VIS ISRAEL, BUILDING ON THE FEZ 
PRINCIPLES. 
 
-- DIPLOMACY/MEDIATION:  THE SAG CONTINUES TO 
SUPPORT IN PRINCIPLE ALL MEDIATION EFFORTS, DESPITE 
ITS REALISTIC APPRECIATION THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE 
TO PROVE FUTILE UNTIL IRAN FINDS ITSELF UNABLE 
TO ESCAPE THE CONCLUSION THAT IT MUST SEEK A 
NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT.  IN PARTICULAR, THE SAG 
CONTINUES IN A LOW-KEY MANNER TO ENCOURAGE AND 
PARTICIPATE IN EFFORTS OF THE OIC, THE GCC AND THE 
ARAB LEAGUE, AS IT CONTINUES TO CULTIVATE RELATIONS 
AND MAINTAIN A LIMITED DIALOGUE ON THE WAR WITH 
NATIONS IT SEES AS POSSIBLE MEDIATORS WHEN THE 
TIME IS RIGHT, PRINCIPALLY TURKEY, PAKISTAN, SYRIA 
AND ALGERIA.  SAUDI ARABIA AND ITS GULF ALLIES HAVE 
FOUND THE SECURITY COUNCIL RECEPTIVE TO THEIR 
EFFORTS TO STIGMATIZE AND ISOLATE IRAN BECAUSE OF 
ITS PROSECUTION OF THE WAR BUT HAVE RESIDUAL DOUBTS 
ABOUT MEDIATION BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO AT 
LEAST UNTIL HIS GULF SWING AND VISIT TO TEHRAN WAS 
SEEN AS UNCONCERNED ABOUT ENDING THE WAR AND BIASSED 
TOWARD TEHRAN. 
 
-- PROPAGANDA:  AN FSN WHO HAS BEEN MONITORING 
ARABIC-LANGUAGE BROADCASTS FROM IRAN REPORTS THAT 
IRANIAN PROPAGANDA HAS CONTINUED UNABATED IN RECENT 
WEEKS, WITH NON-STOP ATTACKS ON GULF REGIMES AND 
THEIR SUPPORT FOR IRAQ, ON THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT 
OF HOSNI MUBARAK, ON KING HUSSEIN, ON THE U.S. AND 
ON ISRAEL.  ATTACKS ON THE SAG, HOWEVER, DROPPED 
OFF SHARPLY DURING AND AFTER FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD\'S 
MAY 18-20 VISIT TO TEHRAN AND CONTINUE TO BE HELD 
IN ABEYANCE. WE BELIEVE AN FBIS READING ON IRANIAN 
PROPAGANDA WOULD BE USEFUL, BUT OUR FSN\'S READING 
SEEMS TO US CONSISTENT WITH IRAN\'S CURRENT EFFORT 
TO VEIL THE UNCOMPROMISING IDEOLOGY THAT HOLDS SWAY 
THERE WITH DIPLOMATIC CIVILITY AND MERELY VERBAL 
FLEXIBILITY. 
 
-- RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL ATTITUDES, ELITE AND POPULAR: 
AT THE LEVEL OF THE ULEMA AND OTHER ISLAMICALLY- 
EDUCATED SAUDIS, WE PERCEIVE A DIVISION OF THOUGHT 
AND FEELING BETWEEN REGARDING THE IRANIANS AND 
OTHER SHI\'A AS BROTHER MUSLIMS, WITH WHOM THE 
TIES OF SHARED VALUES ARE STRONGER THAN THEIR 
DIFFERENCES, AND A DEEPER AND STRONGER STRAIN OF 
SUSPICION BASED ON THE PERCEPTION THAT SHI\'A 
BELIEFS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY HERETICAL, ALMOST NOT 
TRULY MONOTHEISTIC, AND THAT THEY CONTAIN IN FACT 
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STRAINS DEEPLY HOSTILE TO 
SUNNI ARAB SOCIETIES.  SUCH SENTIMENTS ARE SHARED 
IN CRUDER FORM AT MORE POPULAR LEVELS AND ARE OF 
COURSE MIRRORED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GULF. 
THE RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL ANTIPATHIES INVOLVED ARE 
NEVER FAR FROM THE SURFACE AND WILL NOT DISAPPEAR. 
IN SAUDI ARABIA THEY ARE, OF COURSE, SOMETIMES 
EXACERBATED BY THE ALWAYS UNCOMFORTABLE, AT TIMES 
TENSE, RELATIONS BETWEEN SUNNIS AND THE DISCRIMINATED- 
AGAINST ARAB SHI\'A MINORITY. 
 
-- THE SOVIET UNION AND AFGHANISTAN:  CONIINUING 
SAUDI CONCERN ABOUT SOVIET INTENTIONS KEEPS ALIVE 
SAUDI DISQUIET ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF IRAN-SOVIET 
RAPPROCHEMENT; AND ALTHOUGH SAUDI AFGHAN POLICY 
FOCUSES ON PAKISTAN AND THE AFGHAN MUJAHIDEEN, 
THE SAG COULD BE EXPECTED TO BECOME CONCERNED AT 
ANY HINT THAT IRAN MIGHT DISCOMFIT AFGHAN REFUGEES 
OR HINDER THE RESISTANCE IN ORDER TO AVOID 
DIFFICULTIES WITH THE USSR.  FOR THE MOMENT, WE 
BELIEVE, THE SAG IS REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT THE 
SAME POWERFUL IDEOLOGY THAT LEADS IRAN TO REJECT 
A NEGOTIATED PEACE WILL PREVENT ANY SIGNIFICANT 
SACRIFICE OF MUJAHIDEEN INTERESTS TO AN ACCOMMO- 
DATION WITH THE USSR.  IF, HOWEVER, A GROWING 
PERCEPTION BY IRAN OF A FAILURE OF ITS WAR EFFORT 
FORCES GRADUAL MODIFICATION OF IRANIAN POLICY IN 
MORE PRAGMATIC DIRECTIONS, SUCH AS GREATER RECEP- 
TIVENESS TO A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION, A POSSIBLE SIDE 
EFFECT COULD BE A MORE PRAGMATIC, ACCOMMODATIONIST 
IRANIAN POLICY TOWARD THE SOVIET UNION, WHICH COULD 
SIGNIFY A PERIOD OF GREATER RISK FOR THE AFGHAN 
MUJAHIDEEN. 
 
-- TRADE:  SAUDI-IRANIAN TRADE, UNSURPRISINGLY, 
REMAINS MINISCULE.  SAUDI IMPORTS FROM IRAN IN 
THE FIRST HALF OF 1984 AMOUNTED TO SR54.6 MILLION, 
ALMOST ALL ACCOUNTED FOR BY CARPETS, NUTS, AND 
DRIED FRUITS.  SAUDI EXPORTS TO IRAN WERE SR51.5 
MILLION IN 1980, UP TO SR43.8 MILLION IN 1981 AND 
DOWN AGAIN TO SR22.6 MILLION IN 1982, THE LAST YEAR 
FOR WHICH THE SAG PUBLISHED FIGURES FOR EXPORTS 
TO IRAN.  IN 1981 AND 1982, SAUDI EXPORTS TO IRAN 
CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF UREA AND OTHER NITROGEN 
FERTILIZERS.  AN END TO THE WAR WOULD PROBABLY MEAN 
AN INCREASE IN TWO-WAY TRADE, BUT PROBABLY NOT A 
DRAMATIC ONE. 
 
17.  CONCLUSION:  IF THE GULF WAR IS RESOLVED IN 
TIME BY NEGOTIATION OR SETTLES INTO A LONG-TERM, 
LOW-VIOLENCE STALEMATE, SOME ABATEMENT OF IRANIAN 
REVOLUTIONARY FERVOR AND SOME ADJUSTMENT OF IRANIAN 
REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY WILL PROBABLY HAVE ACCOM- 
PANIED SUCH DEVELOPMENTS.  IF THIS OCCURS, LONG- 
TERM PROSPECTS FOR CIVIL RELATIONS BETWEEN SAUDI 
ARABIA AND IRAN MAY NOT BE BAD.  THE TWO STATES 
HAVE SOME PERMANENT COMMON INTERESTS THAT MAY 
REASSERT THEMSELVES ONCE IRANIANS NO LONGER SEE 
POLITICS PRIMARILY AS THEOLOGY.  AFTER A PERIOD OF 
FLIRTATION WITH STATISM IN IRAN, BOTH REGIMES 
BASICALLY FAVOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.  TRADE AND 
EVEN INVESTMENT COULD GROW.  BOTH STATES HAVE 
ABUNDANT OIL RESERVES AND A CONCERN OR INTEREST 
IN MAINTAINING OPEC SOLIDARITY.  BOTH STATES, TOO, 
WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE AN INTEREST IN PREVENTING 
IRAQ FROM BECOMING TOO POWERFUL.  (THIS OVER TIME 
COULD DEVELOP INTO A SHARED INTEREST IN MAINTAINING 
A THREE-WAY BALANCE OF POWER AMONG IRAQ, IRAN AND 
THE GCC.)  BOTH STATES, OBVIOUSLY FOR VERY DIFFERENT 
REASONS, HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SUPERPOWER INVOLVE- 
MENT IN GULF AFFAIRS (ALTHOUGH THE SAUDIS CLEARLY 
DO NOT OBJECT TO THE MODEST \"OVER THE HORIZON\" 
U.S. NAVY PRESENCE AND THAT REPRESENTED BY THE 
SHIPS OF COMIDEASTFOR).  FINALLY, BOTH STATES SHARE 
AN ANTIPATHY FOR THE SOVIET UNION AND DESIRE TO 
MAKE THE PRICE IT IS PAYING IN AFGHANISTAN AS 
HIGH AS POSSIBLE.  IF THE IRANIAN URGE TO ACHIEVE 
ITS GOALS BY MILITARY MEANS DECLINES AND IF 
IRANIAN IDEOLOGY MODERATES IN THE FACE OF POLITICAL, 
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY FRUSTRATION, THEN SUCH SHARED 
VIEWS AND INTERESTS MAY AGAIN COME TO THE FORE. 
THIS IS CLEARLY A SAUDI HOPE, AND A POSSIBILITY 
THE SAG STRONGLY DESIRES TO KEEP ALIVE, EVEN AS 
IT EMPHASIZES ITS PREEMINENT SHORT-TERM GOAL 
OF HELPING AVOID AN IRAQI DEFEAT.  END CONCLUSION.

2.  SUMMARY:  THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN TEHRAN AND RIYADH 
CONTINUES AT A HIGH PITCH.  FOR THE IRANIANS, THE SAUDIS 
ARE SERVANTS AND INSTRUMENTS FOR \"WORLD ARROGANCE\" OR 
THE \"GREAT SATAN\" (I.E. THE U.S.) WHO HAVE PERPETRATED A 
\"DIRTY, UGLY, ODIOUS AND MONSTROUS ACT\" IN MECCA AND WHO 
WITH THE KUWAITIS PLOTTED TO BRING THE FORCES OF THEIR 
U.S. MASTERS INTO THE GULF.  FAHD AND THE AL SAUD ARE 
CONDEMNED AS LIARS, OPPRESSORS AND CORRUPT RULERS, 
UNWORTHY OF CONTROLLING ISLAM\'S HOLIEST SITES.  THESE 
CHARGES ARE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OFFENSIVE TO THE 
SAUDIS.  THEY HAVE RESPONDED VIGOROUSLY, AT HOME AND 
ABROAD.  THE SAUDIS TAKE TWO LINES IN REGARD TO THE 
IRANIANS:  A RELIGIOUS APPROACH ARGUING THAT THE 
IRANIANS ARE GUILTY OF \"USING ISLAM TO SERVE POLITICS\" 
AND THAT IRANIAN METHODS AND BEHAVIOR DIRECTLY 
CONTRAVENE ISLAMIC LAW;  AND A POLITICAL APPROACH THAT 
DEPICTS THE IRANIANS AS FANATICS, COMPULSIVE LIARS, AND 
PROVOCATEURS WHO SYSTEMATICALLY SHOW CONTEMPT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL RULES AND FOR ATTEMPTS TO DEAL CIVILLY 
WITH THEM.  IMAGES EMPHASIZED BY THE SAUDIS INCLUDE THE 
RIOTS AT MAKKAH (WITH IRANIAN ATTEMPTS TO SMUGGLE 
EXPLOSIVES IN 1986), THE ATTACKS ON EMBASSIES, AND NOW 
THE INHUMAN TREATMENT RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF SAUDI 
DIPLOMAT AL-GHAMDI.  SAUDI OFFICIAL AND PRESS TREATMENT 
DIFFER ONLY IN TONE:  OFFICIALS TEND TO PLAY THESE 
THEMES MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER.  THE SAUDIS MAY 
TIRE OF THIS UNACCUSTOMED LEVEL OF RHETORIC, BUT NOT 
UNLESS THE IRANIANS BACK OFF.  THE SAUDIS SEE THEIR 
POSITION AS STRONG DIPLOMATICALLY, PROPAGANDISTICALLY, 
AND RELIGIOUSLY, INCLUDING IN THE AREA OF POSSIBLE 
RESTRICTIONS ON THE IRANIANS FOR NEXT YEAR\'S HAJJ.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN RIYADH AND TEHRAN, WHICH 
BEGAN IN EARNEST AFTER THE MAKKAH VIOLENCE OF JULY 31, 
CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE SAUDI PRESS, ANSWERING THE 
VIRULENT RHETORIC ISSUING FROM TEHRAN.  THE IRANIANS 
CALL FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE SAG AND ACCUSE THE SAG 
DAILY OF MASSACRING HUNDREDS OF MUSLIMS IN MAKKAH AND OF 
VARIOUS OTHER RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL \"CRIMES\".  IRANIAN 
MAJLIS SPEAKER RAFSANJANI\'S FRIDAY SERMON OF AUGUST 21 
(REF A) PROVIDES A COMPENDIUM OF IRAN\'S PROPAGANDA 
THEMES, CONSTANTLY REECHOED IN PRINT AND ELECTRONIC 
MEDIA.  TAKING AS HIS CENTRAL THEME \"ARROGANCE VS. 
MEEKNESS,\" RAFSANJANI DISCUSSES FIRST THE WAR AND SECOND 
THE \"EXISTING SITUATION IN THE REGION.\"  HE ESTABLISHES 
AS HIS FRAMEWORK THE PROPOSITION THAT \"WORLD 
ARROGANCE\"--THE U.S., PORTRAYED AS THE \"MASTERS AND 
SUPPORTERS OF IRAQ AND OTHER PUPPETS--HAS BEEN FORCED BY 
THE PROSPECT OF AN IMMINENT IRANIAN VICTORY TO ABANDON 
ITS PRETENSE OF NEUTRALITY AND COME OUT IN THE OPEN IN 
THE REGION. 
 
4.  AFTER AN EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION IN KORANIC TERMS OF 
THE NATURE OF ARROGANCE AND U.S. ORCHESTRATION OF THE 
WAR AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION AND THE 
INEVITABLE DEFEAT OF THE U.S. AND ITS DESIGNS, 
RAFSANJANI MOVES ON TO DISCUSS SAUDI ARABIA.  ADDRESSING 
THE U.S., HE SAYS \"YOU HAVE HAD TO FORCE SAUDI ARABIA TO 
COMMIT SUICIDE IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY ACHIEVE YOUR ENDS. 
THE HOUSE OF SAUD WAS MUCH TOO WISE TO SOIL ITS HANDS IN 
A CRIME WHICH ACCORDING TO THE IMAM\'S SAYING CAN NEVER 
BE CLEANSED WITH WATER OF ZAMZAM UNTIL ETERNITY.  EVEN 
IF MR. FAHD BATHS IN THE WELL OF ZAMZAM, NOBODY COULD 
BELIEVE THAT THE (STAIN) COULD BE ERADICATED.\"  IN 
CONTEXT, THIS ATTACK APPEARS TO REFER BOTH TO THE SAUDI 
ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE U.S. PRESENCE IN THE GULF AND TO 
THE \"MASSACRE\" IN MECCA, AND RAFSANJANI GOES ON TO 
DENOUNCE AT LENGTH THE U.S. PRESENCE AND TO PREDICT ITS 
CERTAIN FAILURE. 
 
5.  FINALLY, RAFSANJANI TAKES UP THE \"BITTER EVENT\" IN 
MAKKAH, DECLARING THAT \"THIS WAS SUCH A DIRTY, UGLY, 
ODIOUS AND MONSTROUS ACT THAT WE DO NOT THINK THAT ANY 
OTHER SINISTER ELEMENT SAVE THE GREAT SATAN WOULD BE 
PREPARED TO SOIL ITS HANDS IN THIS....\"  HE CLAIMS THAT 
THROUGHOUT THE ISLAMIC WORLD MUSLIMS ARE PROTESTING: 
\"HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOW ANGRY.... 
THEY (THE SAUDIS) HAVE NOW SENSED THIS; THEY SUDDENLY 
INSTRUCTED THAT 100 OF THOSE PRINCES..INDULGING 
THEMSELVES IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE--RETURN TO SAUDI 
ARABIA.\"  IN KEEPING WITH HIS THEME AND FRAMEWORK, 
RAFSANJANI SAYS \"THE UNITED STATES IS ITSELF 
RESPONSIBLE.....THE DEFEAT OF SAUDI ARABIA WOULD MEAN 
THE DEFEAT OF THE UNITED STATES, SINCE SAUDI ARABIA IS 
ITS MOST IMPORTANT BASE IN THE REGION.  THE UNITED 
STATES HURT ITSELF AND SAUDI ARABIA BY THIS ACT.\" 
RAFSANJANI ALSO CHARGED THAT THE SAG WAS FUNDING A 
PRO-REAGAN PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN IN THE U.S. TO HELP REAGAN 
RECOVER POLITICAL POPULARITY LOST BECAUSE OF EVENTS IN 
THE GULF (REF. 3.).  OTHER RECENT IRANIAN CHARGES 
INCLUDE THE SAG\'S IMPRISONING OF ITS OWN SOLDIERS FOR 
REFUSING \"TO SHOOT AT HAJJ PILGRIMS DURING THE MASSACRE 
IN MAKKAH.\"  THE IRANIANS ALSO HAVE CALLED FOR THE 
SAUDIS TO RELINQUISH CONTROL OVER MAKKAH AND MEDINA, THE 
CENTERS OF THE ANNUAL MUSLIM PILGRIMAGE AND HAVE QUOTED 
HIZBOLLAH MEMBERS FROM LEBANON CALLING FOR THE OVERTHROW 
OF THE SAG.  SAUDI CONTACTS ALSO REPORT HEARING IRANIAN 
RADIO BROADCASTS IN ARABIC DENOUNCING THE SAG FOR 
RECEIVING U.S. CONGRESSMAN STEPHEN SOLARZ. 
 
6.  THE SAUDIS FOR THEIR PART HAVE LAUNCHED THEIR OWN 
RHETORICAL AND DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVES AGAINST IRAN. 
THERE HAVE BEEN DAILY ARTICLES, PHOTOGRAPHS AND 
EDITORIALS:  FRONT PAGE DISPLAYS OF CONFISCATED WEAPONS 
FROM MAKKAH (MOSTLY SCISSORS, NAIL FILES AND LARGE 
KITCHEN KNIVES); ARTICLES ACCUSING THE IRANIANS OF 
WORSHIPING KHOMEINI, NOT GOD; CLAIMS TO HAVE DOCUMENTED 
IRANIAN INTENTIONS TO SEIZE CONTROL OF THE GRAND 
MOSQUE;  INTERVIEWS WITH SAUDI OFFICIALS (E.G. THE 
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SECURITY AND HIS BOSS MINISTER OF 
INTERIOR NAYIF); EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF IRANIAN 
BARBARITY IN MECCA; AND EXTENSIVE, SOMETIMES ALMOST 
LURID PLAY ON THE ATTACKS ON THE SAUDI, KUWAITI AND 
OTHER EMBASSIES IN TEHRAN.  THE DEATH OF SAUDI POLITICAL 
ATTACHE IN TEHRAN MUSA\'ID AL-GHAMDI SUPPLIED AN 
IMPORTANT PART OF THE BATTLE OF RHETORIC THE PAST WEEK: 
IN BOLD HEADLINES AUGUST 19 THE ARABIC NEWSPAPER 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT DEMANDED THAT IRAN\'S RULERS BE PUT TO 
TRIAL FOR AL-GHAMDI\'S DEATH.  THE IRANIANS RESPONDED 
THAT THE SAUDIS HAD PREVENTED AL-GHAMDI FROM RECEIVING 
THE MEDICAL TREATMENT HE NEEDED, WHILE THE SAUDIS SAID 
THE IRANIANS HAD REFUSED TO ALLOW THEM TO MEDEVAC 
AL-GHAMDI SO HE COULD GET THE NEEDED TREATMENT. 
 
7.  THE THEMES OF THE SAUDI OFFENSIVE, AS THEY HAVE 
EMERGED IN STATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED (INCLUDING IN 
THE EMBASSY\'S PAST THREE YEARS\' HAJJ REPORTING) ARE 
SEVERAL.  ONE OFT-REPEATED THEME IS THAT POLITICS MUST 
BE CONDUCTED TO SERVE ISLAM AND ITS PRACTICES AND RITES, 
WHEREAS THE ABUSE OF ISLAM AND ITS RITES TO SERVE 
POLITICAL PURPOSES IS IMPIOUS.  THIS THEME IS AMPLIFIED 
AND SUPPORTED BY CONSTANT ATTACKS ON IRANIAN BEHAVIOR 
AND ACTIONS AS NOT ONLY UNISLAMIC BUT AS IN 
CONTRAVENTION OF SPECIFIC ISLAMIC INJUNCTIONS.  THIS HAS 
BEEN REPEATED IN THE STATEMENT OF THE SAUDI ULEMA 
(PREVIOUSLY REPORTED), IN CITATIONS OF AL-AZHAR AND 
ISLAMIC AUTHORITIES OF SEVERAL NATIONS, AND IN ANGRY 
COMMENTARIES AND EDITORIALS.  KHOMEINI IS ANATHEMATIZED 
AS THE TRUE SPIRITUAL HEIR OF THE KILLERS OF ALI AND OF 
THE PROPHET\'S GRANDSON HUSSEIN, A LATTER-DAY PROPONENT 
OF THE ZUNJ AND OF THE QARMATI SCHISMATICS, AN EXPONENT 
OF DEVIATION (BID\'A), LEADING THE FAITHFUL TO 
HELL-FIRE.  DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MECCA EVENTS BY 
JOURNALISTS AND SAUDI OFFICIALS (CF. REFS B AND C) 
DEPICT THE IRANIANS AS TRYING OVER THE YEARS, IN THE 
FACE OF PATIENT AND RESTRAINED SAUDI EFFORTS TO RESTRAIN 
THEM, TO ENGAGE DURING THE HAJJ RITES IN EXTRANEOUS 
ACTIVITIES HARMFUL TO THE PILGRIMAGE AND ENDANGERING TO 
OTHER PILGRIMS, E.G. LAST YEAR\'S EFFORT BY IRANIAN 
PILGRIMS TO SMUGGLE A LARGE QUANTITY OF PLASTIC 
EXPLOSIVES INTO THE KINGDOM.  THIS YEAR\'S 
EVENTS--DEPICTED AS A WELL-PLANNED AND PREPARED 
PROVOCATION--ARE PAINTED AS HAVING EXHAUSTED THE SAG\'S 
AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD\'S PATIENCE AND FORCED THE SAG AND 
OTHER MUSLIMS TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT HOW TO CONTROL 
IRAN\'S INCORRIGIBLE AND DANGEROUS TROUBLEMAKING.  IRAN\'S 
FANATICAL AND STUBBORN INSISTENCE ON SUCH BEHAVIOR ON 
THE PILGRIMAGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EQUALLY STUBBORN 
INSISTENCE ON CONTINUING A WAR THAT ALL RESPONSIBLE 
PARTIES KNOW MUST END AND THAT IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF HARM 
TO THE ISLAMIC WORLD. 
 
8.  IRANIAN INTRANSIGENCE, DESTRUCTIVENESS AND UNISLAMIC 
BEHAVIOR, IN BOTH THE MECCA EVENTS AND THE GULF WAR, 
ALSO FORM THE THEMES OF THE EMERGING SAUDI DIPLOMATIC 
OFFENSIVE.  THROUGHOUT THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC WORLDS IN 
PARTICULAR, THE SAUDIS APPEAR TO HAVE ENGAGED IN A 
DELUGE OF INFORMATION ACTIVITY (NOTABLY DISTRIBUTION OF 
VIDEOTAPES) AND ARM-TWISTING, AT TIMES MAKING A 
SUPPORTIVE REACTION WITH REGARD TO THE MECCA RIOTS A 
TOUCHSTONE OF BILATERAL RELATIONS.  THIS EFFORT IS 
DIRECTED AT TWO ENDS:  TO ISOLATE IRAN IN THE ISLAMIC 
WORLD (AND CREATE AT LEAST THE THREAT OF SEVERE 
RESTRICTIONS ON IRANIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE PILGIMAGE), 
AND TO GENERATE GREATER SUPPORT FOR UNSC AND OTHER 
ACTIVITIES TO PRESSURE IRAN TO END THE GULF WAR. 
 
9.  WHILE FONMIN SAUD IN TUNIS DID NOT, IN OUR 
UNDERSTANDING, \"CALL FOR\" THE ARABS TO BREAK RELATIONS 
WITH IRAN, IT IS CLEAR FROM HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS BEFORE 
AND DURING THE ARAB LEAGUE MINISTERIAL THAT THIS IS AN 
EVENTUALITY THAT SAUD DID WANT TO RAISE AND WANTS IRAN 
TO BEGIN CONTEMPLATING.  IN HIS ARRIVAL STATEMENT SAUD 
SPECIFICALLY AVERRED THAT IRAN\'S \"ACTIONS AGAINST THE 
EMBASSIES OF THE KINGDOM AND KUWAIT AND OTHER EMBASSIES 
CONFIRMS THAT THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RULES 
AND PRINCIPLES OF DIPLOMATIC ACTION.\" (REF E).  WHILE 
THE ROLE SAUD PLAYED IN THE MEETING WAS AGGRESSIVE (AND 
SAUDI DIPLOMACY IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN THIS VEIN), WE 
BELIEVE THE SAUDI GOAL WAS NOT TO ACHIEVE A BREAK IN 
ARAB RELATIONS WITH IRAN BUT TO CREATE THE THREAT.  (THE 
SAUDIS ARE REALISTS AND UNDERSTAND THE LINEUP OF THE 
PLAYERS.)  THE COMBINATION OF DISCUSSING A HARSH DRAFT 
RESOLUTION, ADOPTING A MILDER ONE, AND DECIDING TO 
RECONVENE IN A MONTH GENERATES PRESSURE ON BOTH SYRIA 
AND IRAN.  IT ALSO PROVIDES SYRIA A JUSTIFICATION FOR 
ACCEPTING THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS ACTUALLY PASSED, WHICH 
IN FACT APPEARS TO GIVE THE SAUDIS WHAT THEY WANTED FROM 
THIS MEETING:  SUPPORT FOR ENFORCEMENT OF UNSC RES. 598, 
AND FOR SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. 
 
10.  COMMENT:  THE SAUDI PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN IS 
UNPRECEDENTED IN ITS EXPLICTNESS, ITS INTENSITY AND ITS 
DURATION.  SINCE THE VIOLENT CLASHES IN MAKKAH BETWEEN 
IRANIAN PILGRIMS AND SAG SECURITY FORCES,  IRAN HAS YET 
TO BE ABSENT FROM THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINES OF THE SAUDI 
PRESS.  SAUDI DIPLOMACY, TOO, IS UNACCUSTOMEDLY 
HIGH-PROFILE AND SHOWS SIGNS OF CONTINUING TO BE SO. 
WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE SAG MAY TIRE OF ALL THIS 
ACTIVITY AND CONFRONTATION, WE DOUBT THAT THIS WILL 
HAPPEN UNLESS THE IRANIANS CHANGE COURSE AND OFFER THE 
SAG AMPLE SPACE AND EXCUSE TO EASE UP.  THE PROVOCATIONS 
AND THE STAKES, IN THE SAG PERSPECTIVE, HAVE BEEN AND 
ARE UNUSUALLY GRAVE.  THE CHALLENGE TO SAUDI 
CUSTODIANSHIP OF THE SHRINES AT MECCA AND MEDINA IS FAR 
TOO SERIOUS AN ISSUE FOR THE SAG TO RISK LOSING BY 
DEFAULT IN ISLAMIC OPINION.  FURTHER, SAG CONCERN AT THE 
THREAT POSED BY THE GULF WAR HAS STEADILY GROWN, AND 
WITH IT SAUDI DETERMINATION TO PUSH HARD FOR AN END TO 
THE WAR.  THE SAG SEES IN THE MECCA EVENTS AN 
OPPORTUNITY FURTHER TO ISOLATE IRAN AND TO CREATE 
GREATER INTERNATIONAL MOMENTUM FOR ACTION BY THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON IRAN. 
 
11.  ON THE HOME FRONT THE SAG SEES THE POSSIBILITY OF 
PUTTING IRAN IN THE POSITION OF WEAKENED DEMANDEUR WITH 
REGARD TO FUTURE HAJJ ARRANGEMENTS.  WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OR ALL SAUDI DIPLOMATS MAY BE 
WITHDRAWN FROM TEHRAN AND HINTS ABROAD OF SOME FORM OF 
INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC APPROVAL FOR THE SAUDIS TO 
RESTRICT THE RIGHT OF TROUBLEMAKERS TO MAKE THE HAJJ, 
THE SAUDIS BELIEVE THE IRANIANS WILL ONE DAY NOTE THAT 
THEY MAY FACE THE CHOICE OF CONCILIATING THE SAG OR 
BEING UNABLE, WHETHER FOR FORMAL OR LOGISTICAL REASONS, 
TO SEND MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF PILGRIMS NEXT YEAR.  THUS 
THE SAUDIS SEE THEIR POSITION VIS-A-VIS THE IRANIANS AS 
ESPECIALLY STRONG AT PRESENT, AND ARE SHOWING EVERY SIGN 
OF DETERMINATION TO PRESS THEIR ADVANTAGE.  END 
COMMENT.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  FOLLOWING IS AN OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY SENT TO THE 
EMBASSY FROM CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S OFFICE IN THE 
NATIONAL GUARD TO ASSIST IN PLANNING FOR ABDULLAH\'S 
VISIT TO WASHINGTON.  WHILE THE BIOGRAPHY CONTAINS 
NOTHING SURPRISING, IT IS NOTEWORTHY FOR ITS EMPHASIS ON 
THE CONTINUITY OF THE AL SAUD PRESENCE IN THE ARABIAN 
PENINSULA SINCE THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND ITS STRESS ON 
ABDULLAH\'S ROLE AS AN INTERNATIONAL STATESMAN.  AN 
UNOFFICIAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION FOLLOWS.  WE WILL POUCH 
ORIGINAL ARABIC TO NEA/ARP. 
 
 
BEGIN TEXT OF CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S BIOGRAPHY: 
 
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE ABDULLAH IBN ABD AL-AZIZ 
CROWN PRINCE, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND 
COMMANDER OF THE SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL GUARD 
 
BIRTH: 
 
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE ABDULLAH IBN ABD AL-AZIZ IBN 
ABD AR-RAHMAN AL-FAYSAL AL SAUD WAS BORN IN THE CITY OF 
RIYADH, CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA IN 1343H 
CORRESPONDING TO 1924 AD. 
 
HIS FAMILY: 
 
HE BELONGS TO THE AL SAUD FAMILY.  HIS FATHER IS THE 
LATE KING ABD AL-AZIZ IBN ABD AR-RAHMAN AL-FAYSAL AL 
SAUD (1880-1953 A.D.), WHO FOUNDED THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI 
ARABIA AFTER HE BOLDLY EMBARKED ON THE BATTLE TO UNIFY 
THE ARABIAN PENINSULA IN THE FIRST THIRD OF THE 20TH 
CENTURY.  HE BROUGHT HIS PEOPLE FROM A STATE OF 
CONTENTIOUS TRIBES AND SMALL, ISOLATED PRINCIPALITIES 
INTO A MODERN ARAB NATION THAT HAS ADOPTED ISLAM BOTH AS 
A WAY OF LIFE AND CONSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT.  KING ABD 
AL-AZIZ ALWAYS BELIEVED, \"WE, THE AL SAUD, ARE FIRST A 
HOUSE WITH A RELIGIOUS MESSAGE, AND THEN A HOUSE OF 
RULERS.\" 
 
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: 
 
THE AL SAUD FAMILY TRACES ITS ROOTS TO THE TRIBE OF ANZA 
IBN RABE\'A, NUMERICALLY THE LARGEST ARAB TRIBE.  IT CAME 
INTO PROMINENCE DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES AS THE 
FAMILY OF REFORM AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE INTELLECTUAL, 
CULTURAL, AND LINGUISTIC UNITY OF THE ARAB PENINSULA, 
BASED ON THE ISLAMIC TRADITIONALIST MOVEMENT FOUNDED BY 
A SON OF THE NEW-ISLAMIC RENAISSANCE, SHEIKH MOHAMMAD 
IBN ABD AL-WAHAB (1703-1792 AD).  FIRST AMONG THOSE WHO 
SUPPORTED THE SHEIKH IN THE SPREAD OF HIS CALL WAS 
PRINCE MOHAMMAD IBN SAUD WHO DIED IN 1765H.  HE WAS THE 
FOUNDER OF THE FIRST SAUDI DYNASTY, WHICH ITSELF PASSED 
THROUGH SEVERAL STAGES, INCLUDING THE PERIOD OF THE 
GREAT IMAMS WHO FOUGHT SUPERSTITIONS, UNIFIED THE RANKS 
OF THE NATION AND WERE DEEMED TO BE THE PIONEERS OF 
RELIGIOUS, ETHICAL, AND SOCIAL REFORM. 
 
THE UNIFICATION AND RENOVATION MOVEMENT LED BY KING ABD 
AL-AZIZ, FATHER OF PRINCE ABDULLAH, IS A CONTINUATION OF 
THE STRUGGLE OF HIS FAMILY TO MOTIVATE MUSLIM ARAB 
SOCIETY TOWARD A REAWAKENING AND STRUCTURING, BASED ON 
TRUE FAITH, RETURN TO THE PURE TEACHINGS OF THE HOLY 
KORAN AND PURE PROPHETIC TRADITIONS. 
 
 
INFLUENCES IN PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S LIFE: 
 
A.  PRINCE ABDULLAH LEARNED POLITICS AT HIS FATHER\'S SIDE. 
 
B.  HE BEGAN HIS EDUCATION IN THE TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC 
WAY, IN THE MOSQUES UNDER RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS WHO 
CULTIVATED HIS MIND.  HE IS AN AVID AND VORACIOUS READER 
INTERESTED IN CULTURE, POLITICS, AND ECONOMICS. 
 
 
C.  HIS FAMILY: 
 
FOUR OF THE CROWN PRINCE\'S BROTHERS, UNDER WHOM HE HAS 
SERVED IN THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT, HAVE BEEN KING: 
 
--SAUD IBN ABD AL-AZIZ (1952-1964) 
--FAYSAL IBN ABD AL-AZIZ (1964-1975) 
--KHALED IBN ABD AL-AZIZ (1975-1982) 
--KING FAHD IBN ABD AL-AZIZ, THE CURRENT KING (WHOM 
  PRINCE ABDULLAH NOW SERVES AS CROWN PRINCE) 
 
D.  AS CROWN PRINCE, PRINCE ABDULLAH IS IN CLOSE CONTACT 
WITH URBAN, RURAL AND DESERT SAUDI SOCIETY.  HE OFTEN 
MEETS WITH THE ULEMA, SHEIKHS AND RELIGIOUS COUNSELORS 
FOR AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND CONSULTATIONS.  HE ALSO 
RECEIVES ANY SAUDI NATIONAL WHO REQUESTS A MEETING WITH 
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FOR ANY RELIGIOUS OR MUNDANE MATTER. 
 
 
INSTALLATION OF PRINCE ABDULLAH AS CROWN PRINCE: 
 
ON SUNDAY, JUNE 13, 1982, THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA 
PROCLAIMED HIS MAJESTY KING FAHD IBN ABD AL-AZIZ KING 
AND LEADER AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE ABDULLAH CROWN 
PRINCE.  ALL MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY ACKNOWLEDGED 
THEM AND PAID HOMAGE TO THEM.  THE EVENING OF THE SAME 
DAY, KING FAHD APPOINTED PRINCE ABDULLAH DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER AND COMMANDER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD, IN 
ADDITION TO HIS POST AS CROWN PRINCE. 
 
 
COMMANDER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD: 
 
WHEN KING FAYSAL IBN ABD AL-AZIZ ASSUMED POWER, HE WAS 
FULLY AWARE THAT HIS ERA WOULD BE HISTORICALLY 
SIGNIFICANT.  HE THEREFORE SELECTED HIS OFFICIALS FOR 
THEIR QUALITY.  THE NATIONAL GUARD, WHICH BRINGS 
TOGETHER THE DESCENDENTS OF THOSE WHO LIVED WITH KING 
ABD AL-AZIZ WHEN HE UNITED THE KINGDOM, HAS A SPECIAL 
SIGNIFICANCE.  THE NATIONAL GUARD NEEDED A MAN WHO COULD 
LEAD AND DEVELOP THE FORCE INTO A SETTLED INSTITUTION. 
PRINCE ABDULLAH WAS SUCH A MAN.  KING FAYSAL THEREFORE 
CHOSE HIM TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY IN 1964 
(1384H).  PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S APPOINTMENT WAS A MILESTONE 
FOR THE INSTITUTION, AND SINCE THEN, PRINCE ABDULLAH HAS 
COMMANDED THE FORCE, A LEADER CLOSE TO HIS MEN WHO PAYS 
ATTENTION TO THEIR CONCERNS AND LIVES, WITH THE 
CONSCIENCE AND SPIRIT OF A MUSLIM COMMANDER. 
 
 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: 
 
IN 1975, KING KHALED APPOINTED PRINCE ABDULLAH SECOND 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, IN ADDITION TO HIS POST AS 
COMMANDER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. 
 
 
ARAB AND ISLAMIC RELATIONS: 
 
AS PART OF THE POLICY OF THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA TO 
STRENGTHEN ARAB AND ISLAMIC SOLIDARITY AND PURSUE JOINT 
ENDEAVORS WHICH SERVE THE ISLAMIC AND ARAB NATION AND TO 
DEEPEN THE EXISTING BROTHERLY TIES AMONG ARAB STATES 
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ARAB LEAGUE AND THE ARAB 
SUMMITS, PRINCE ABDULLAH HAS TRAVELED AND HAD NUMEROUS 
CONTACTS WITH THE LEADERS OF THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC 
WORLD.  THE CROWN PRINCE WORKS CONSTANTLY TO HEAL ARAB 
RIFTS. 
 
IN HIS VIEW, RIYADH IS A PLACE OPEN TO ALL ARABS BECAUSE 
OF THE KINGDOM\'S SPECIAL ROLE IN GUARDING THE HOLIEST 
ARAB AND MUSLIM SHRINES.

1986  IRAQ 
 
 
OTHER MUSLIM COUNTRIES:

ROLE TO PLAY IN FURTHERING WORLD STABILITY.  IT ALSO 
PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN OPEC, IN THE NORTH-SOUTH 
DIALOGUE, AND IN COOPERATION BETWEEN THE NON-ALIGNED

SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: 1988 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 357278 
 
------------------------ 
SECTION I - UNCLASSIFIED 
------------------------ 
 
1.  THERE FOLLOWS DRAFT VERSION OF THE SAUDI ARABIAN 
SUBMISSION TO THE 1988 REPORT TO CONGRESS ON 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, KEYED TO REFTEL. 
 
2. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL POSTS-- 
 
-     A. RESULTS OF 1988 COURT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM: 
 
-     FOLLOWING BOMBINGS IN MARCH AND APRIL AT TWO 
INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES AT RAS TANURA AND JUBAIL, IN THE 
EASTERN PROVINCE, AND THE DISMANTLING OF ANOTHER BOMB AT 
RAS TANURA, THREE YOUNG MEN WERE ARRESTED AT QATIF IN 
EARLY AUGUST AFTER A GUN BATTLE WITH POLICE.  THE THREE 
AND AN ACCOMPLICE WERE CHARGED WITH TERRORISM, SABOTAGE, 
CONSPIRING WITH IRAN, AND, IN THE CASE OF TWO, MURDER. 
THEY WERE TRIED IN CLOSED SESSION, ACCORDING TO SAUDI 
LAW, DURING SEPTEMBER OF 1988, FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED 
TO DEATH.  PRIOR TO THE EXECUTION, AUTHORITIES RECEIVED 
THREATS FROM AN UNKNOWN GROUP CALLING ITSELF \"HIZBOLLAH 
OF THE HEJAZ\".  AFTER REVIEW OF THE SENTENCES BY THE 
KING, THE EXECUTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT BY DECAPITATION ON 
SEPTEMBER 30.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, AUTHORITIES RECEIVED 
THREATS OF RETALIATION FROM AN ALSO-UNKNOWN \"ISLAMIC 
JIHAD OF THE HIJAZ\", POSSIBLY THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS 
GROUP. 
 
-     B. STATUS OF THE PLO IN THE HOST COUNTRY: 
 
-     THE STATUS OF THE PLO IN SAUDI ARABIA DID NOT 
CHANGE DURING 1988.  THE PLO MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC 
REPRESENTATION IN THE KINGDOM, WITH A MISSION NEAR 
RIYADH\'S DIPLOMATIC QUARTER.  SAUDI ARABIA WAS ONE OF THE 
FIRST COUNTRIES TO RECOGNIZE THE DECLARATION OF A 
PALESTINIAN STATE ISSUED BY THE PNC IN NOVEMBER, 1988. 
 
-     C. STATEMENTS BY THE HOST COUNTRY IN SUPPORT OF 
TERRORISM OR TERRORISM-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES: 
 
-     SAUDI ARABIA DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH STATEMENTS 
DURING 1988.  IN FACT, HIGH OFFICIALS CONDEMNED TERRORISM 
ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, MOST NOTICABLY IN THE CASE OF 
THE KUWAITI AIRLINER HIJACKING IN APRIL, WHICH INVOLVED 
SAUDI CITIZENS.  AS IN THAT CASE, THEY HAVE GENERALLY 
CONDEMNED TERRORIST ACTS CARRIED OUT IN THE NAME OF THE 
PALESTINIAN CAUSE WHILE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT 
OF A PALESTINIAN STATE. 
 
3. SPECIFIC POST REPORTING REQUIREMENTS-- 
 
-     A. REVIEW OF MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS IN CY 
1988: 
 
-     SAUDI ARABIA CONTINUED TO SPEAK OUT STRONGLY AND 
VOTE AGAINST TERRORISM IN 1988 ON ALL APPROPRIATE 
OCCASIONS.  IN THE FIELD OF ANTI-TERRORISM TRAINING, WEST 
GERMAN SPECIALIST GEN. ULRICH WEGENER ARRIVED IN JUNE TO 
BEGIN ADVANCED TRAINING FOR THE ANTI-TERRORISM FORCES OF 
THE SAUDI SPECIAL SECURITY FORCE, FOUNDED IN 1979.  THE 
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALSO SENT AN OFFICER TO A US 
SEMINAR ON NEGOTIATING IN HOSTAGE SITUATIONS.  FOLLOWING 
THE EASTERN PROVINCE BOMBINGS, INDUSTRIAL SECURITY WAS 
CONSIDERABLY TIGHTENED, AND CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF 
EMPLOYEES WERE PUT UNDER INCREASED SURVEILLANCE.  THE 
SAUDIS ALSO TOOK ELABORATE SECURITY PREPARATIONS FOR THE 
1988 HAJJ (THE ANNUAL PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA AND MEDINA) IN 
VIEW OF THE RIOTS CAUSED BY IRANIAN PILGRIMS THE YEAR 
BEFORE.  THE HAJJ WENT SMOOTHLY.  MONTHS AFTER THE HAJJ, 
THE PRESS REPORTED THAT ARMS HAD BEEN CONFISCATED FROM A 
FEW PILGRIMS. 
 
-     B. RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM: 
 
-     IN AUGUST, THE ULEMA (THE NATIONAL BODY OF 
RELIGIOUS JURISTS) ANNOUNCED PROMULGATION OF A NEW LAW 
DEFINING SABOTAGE AS A MAJOR CRIME FOR WHICH THE DEATH 
PENALTY WAS POSSIBLE; THE DEFINITION OF SABOTAGE IN THE 
LAW INCLUDED HIJACKING OR BOMBING AIRPLANES.  THIS LAW 
WAS REFERRED TO REPEATEDLY IN THE MEDIA DURING THE TRIAL 
AND EXECUTION OF THE MEN ARRESTED FOR THE EASTERN 
PROVINCE BOMBINGS, ALTHOUGH THEIR CRIMES WERE COMMITTED 
BEFORE THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT.  A ROYAL DECREE, WHICH 
WAS NEVER OFFICIALLY PROMULGATED BUT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE 
SAUDI PRESS, IMPOSED SIMILAR PENALTIES FOR DEMONSTRATING 
DURING THE HAJJ, ENGAGING IN TERRORIST ACTS, OR OTHERWISE 
ATTEMPTING DISRUPTION OF THE PILGRIMAGE.  SAUDI OFFICIALS 
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT HESITATE TO APPLY THESE 
LAWS FULLY IF NEEDED. 
 
-     C. SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC 
SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: 
 
-     THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM AND HAS REPEATEDLY SPOKEN AND VOTED AGAINST 
TERORIST ACTS IN INTERNATIONAL FORA.  SAUDI OFFICIALS 
MAKE A CAREFUL DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM 
AND SUPPORT OF THE PLO, WHICH THEY CONSIDER A LEGITIMATE 
NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  WHILE DECRYING ACTS OF 
TERRORISM ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED IN THE NAME OF THE 
PALESTINIANS, SAUDI ARABIA SUPPORTS THE PLO BOTH 
POLITICALLY AND FINANCIALLY (INDEED, IT IS ONE OF THAT 
ORGANIZATION\'S LEADING DONORS), AND WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 
NATIONS TO EXTEND DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION TO THE NEW 
PALESTINIAN \"STATE.\"  SAUDI ARABIA IS NOT A KNOWN 
SANCTUARY FOR TERRORISTS. 
 
------------------------- 
SECTION II - CONFIDENTIAL 
------------------------- 
 
4. IN REGARD TO PARAGRAPH 2, PART A, A POLICE SOURCE IN 
THE EASTERN PROVINCE HAS TOLD US THAT SEVERAL MORE 
PERSONS SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY IN THE JUBAIL AND RAS 
TANURA BOMBINGS ARE STILL BEING HELD BY THE SAUDI GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE (GID) WHILE INVESTIGATION OF 
THE CASE CONTINUES.  THUS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FURTHER 
TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE.  AT LEAST ONE OF 
THESE SUSPECTS IS SAID TO BE A SHIA OF LEBANESE ORIGIN, 
LEADING SAUDI POLICE TO BELIEVE THAT \"HIZBOLLAH OF THE 
HIJAZ\" AND \"ISLAMIC JIHAD OF THE HIJAZ\" ARE ONLY 
SURROGATES FOR THE LEBANESE HIZBOLLAH ORGANIZATION.

SUBJECT: SAUDI ARABIA: 1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 363024 
 
1.  THERE FOLLOWS DRAFT VERSION OF SAUDI ARABIAN 
SUBMISSION TO THE 1989 REPORT TO CONGRESS ON 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, KEYED TO REFTEL.  DRAFT 
VERSION OF CLASSIFIED ANNEX IS BEING SENT SEPTEL. 
 
2.  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL POSTS -- 
 
-     A. RESULTS OF 1989 COURT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM: 
 
-      IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE JULY 1989 BOMBINGS AT 
MECCA, SAUDI SECURITY FORCES DETAINED A LARGE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE, POSSIBLY RUNNING INTO THE HUNDREDS, BUT MOST WERE 
QUICKLY RELEASED AFTER INTERROGATION.  THE PERSONS 
FINALLY ARRESTED WERE TRIED WITHOUT PUBLICITY AND 
ACCORDING TO SHARIA LAW, THE CUSTOMARY LEGAL PROCEDURE IN 
SAUDI ARABIA, WHICH DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR PUBLIC TRIALS OR 
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR THE ACCUSED BUT HAS A BUILT-IN 
APPEALS SYSTEM.  ON SEPTEMBER 21, AFTER REVIEW OF THE 
SENTENCES BY TWO DIFFERENT APPEALS BOARDS AND THE KING, 
16 MEN WERE BEHEADED NEAR THE GRAND MOSQUE IN MECCA.  ALL 
WERE SHIA MUSLIMS OF KUWAITI NATIONALITY, ALTHOUGH TWO 
WERE SAID TO BE OF SAUDI AND ONE OF QATARI DESCENT.  AT 
THE SAME TIME, FOUR SHIA OF KUWAITI NATIONALITY WERE 
SENTENCED TO PRISON TERMS AND FLOGGINGS OF 1000 OR 1500 
LASHES, TO BE GIVEN IN INSTALLMENTS OVER THE TERM OF 
THEIR SENTENCES.  NINE SHIA OF KUWAITI NATIONALITY WERE 
RELEASED WITHOUT PUNISHMENT AND REPATRIATED TO KUWAIT. 
 
IN AN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED SHOW OF OPENNESS, SAUDI 
TELEVISION BROADCAST PICTURES OF THE BOMBING SITES, 
INTERVIEWS WITH VICTIMS, AND FULL VIDEOTAPED CONFESSIONS 
BY THE SIXTEEN EXECUTED MEN, WHO DID NOT APPEAR TO BE 
UNDER DURESS AND IN MOST CASES SPOKE CALMLY.  SEVERAL 
STATED IN THEIR CONFESSIONS THAT THEY OBTAINED THE 
EXPLOSIVES USED IN THE BOMBS THROUGH THE IRANIAN EMBASSY 
IN KUWAIT, BUT SAUDI MEDIA DID NOT INITIALLY STRESS THE 
IRANIAN ELEMENT IN THE CASE.  AFTER AN INITIAL PERIOD OF 
RESTRAINT, HOWEVER, THE IRANIAN MEDIA CRITICIZED SAUDI 
ARABIA HARSHLY FOR THE EXECUTIONS, AT WHICH POINT THE 
SAUDI MEDIA BEGAN TO DEAL MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT.  THE SAUDIS ALSO 
PUBLICIZED MESSAGES OF SUPPORT FOR THE TRIALS AND 
EXECUTIONS BY OTHER MUSLIM GOVERNMENTS AND BY MUSLIM 
RELIGIOUS BODIES, INCLUDING SEVERAL SHIA GROUPS IN THE 
EASTERN PROVINCE.  NO EVIDENCE WAS EVER PUBLISHED OF 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASE BY SAUDI SHIA, AND SOME EASTERN 
PROVINCE SHIA REPORTEDLY SENT A LETTER TO THE KING 
SUPPORTING THE SENTENCES AND CONDEMNING THE BOMBINGS. 
 
-     B. STATEMENTS BY HOST COUNTRY IN SUPPORT OF 
TERRORISM-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES ON A TERRORISM ISSUE: 
 
-     SAUDI ARABIA DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH STATEMENTS IN 
1989.  IN FACT, HIGH OFFICIALS STRONGLY CONDEMNED 
TERRORISM ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, MOST NOTABLY AT THE 
TIME OF THE MECCA BOMBINGS NOTED ABOVE, BUT ALSO ON THE 
OCCASION OF TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST SAUDI PERSONNEL AND 
PROPERTY IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT COUNTRIES DURING 1989, 
AND FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT MOAWAD OF 
LEBANON.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT NEVER MADE ANY OFFICIAL 
COMMENT ON THE RUSHDIE CASE.  THE MUSLIM WORLD LEAGUE, 
HEADQUARTERED IN MECCA, AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 
ISLAMIC CONFERENCE (OIC), HEADQUARTERED IN JEDDAH, BOTH 
PASSED RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING RUSHDIE\'S BOOK AND URGING 
AN INTERNATIONAL BOYCOTT OF IT, BUT AN IRANIAN PROPOSAL 
THAT THE OIC ENDORSE IRAN\'S DEATH SENTENCE ON RUSHIE WAS 
TURNED DOWN WITHOUT A VOTE. 
 
3.  SPECIFIC POST REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: 
 
-     A.  REVIEW OF MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS 
UNDERTAKEN IN 1989, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA: 
 
-      SAUDI ARABIA CONTINUED TO SPEAK OUT STRONGLY AND 
VOTE AGAINST TERRORISM IN 1989 ON ALL APPROPRIATE 
OCCASIONS.  IN THE FIELD OF ANTI-TERRORISM TRAINING, THE 
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER THAT THE 
ANTI-TERRORISM UNIT (ATU) OF THE SAUDI SPECIAL FORCES 
(SSF), WHICH BEGAN TRAINING IN 1988, WAS BEING DISBANDED 
AND ITS WEST GERMAN TRAINERS REPATRIATED.  THE REASON 
GIVEN WAS THAT ITS SAUDI COMPONENTS HAD SHOWN THEY NEEDED 
MORE BASIC TRAINING BEFORE THEY COULD ABSORB THE 
SOPHISTICATED TECHNIQUES TAUGHT BY THE WEST GERMANS. 
FOLLOWING A NUMBER OF TERRORIST ACTS OR THREATS AGAINST 
SAUDI DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL ABROAD, THE MINISTRY OF 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS INITITATED A PROGRAM OF COOPERATION WITH 
THE DIPLOMATIC SECURITY DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
STATE, AIMED AT SETTING UP AN EMBASSY GUARD SERVICE AND A 
SYSTEM OF REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICES SIMILAR TO THAT USED 
BY U.S. MISSIONS.  SEVERAL SAUDI OFFICIALS FROM THE 
MINISTRY\'S SECURITY OFFICE TRAVELLED TO THE U.S. FOR 
TRAINING IN WASHINGTON AND AT QUANTICO, AND A STATE 
DEPARTMENT MOBILE TRAINING TEAM VISITED RIYADH TO OFFER 
A SHORT COURSE IN THREAT AWARENESS AND SELF-DEFENSE TO 
MINISTRY PERSONNEL.  THE DEPARTMENT\'S THREAT ASESSMENT 
DIVISION ALSO SENT A TEAM TO SAUDI ARABIA TO CONSULT WITH 
THE SAUDIS ABOUT SHARING INFORMATION IN THE FIELD OF 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY. 
 
FOLLOWING THE EXECUTIONS OF THE MECCA BOMBERS, AND 
SUBSEQUENT THREATS OF RETALIATION BY HIZBULLAH AND OTHER 
TERRORIST GROUPS, SAUDI SECURITY AGENCIES INTENSIFIED 
INTERNAL CONTROLS, ESPECIALLY IN AIRPORTS AND IN THE 
RIYADH AREA.  THESE PRECAUTIONS WERE GRADUALLY RELAXED IN 
THE FOLLOWING WEEKS, BUT AS OF EARLY DECEMBER, POLICE 
WERE CONTINUING TO SET UP ROADBLOCKS AND CARRY OUT 
IDENTIFICATION CHECKS ON AN APPARENTLY RANDOM BASIS, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE RIYADH AREA. 
 
-     B. RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING 
EXTRADITION ACTIONS, ACTIONS ON TERRORISM AFFECTING 
AMERICAN CITIZENS AND FACILITIES, OR DEALING WITH OTHER 
SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF TERRORISM: 
 
-     AS NOTED ABOVE, THE SAUDI JUDICIAL SYSTEM WAS 
CALLED INTO PLAY FOR THE TRIAL OF THE 29 PERSONS ARRESTED 
FOR THE MECCA BOMBINGS.  AFTER THE TRIAL BEFORE A SHARIA 
COURT, THE SENTENCES WERE REVIEWED BY A CASSATION COURT, 
NEXT BY A HIGHER APPEALS COURT, AND FINALLY BY THE KING, 
WHICH IS STANDARD PRACTICE IN ALL SAUDI CASES INVOLVING 
THE DEATH PENALTY.  THOSE INVOLVED IN THE MECCA CASES 
WERE ACTUALLY TRIED FOR THE CRIME OF \"APOSTASY\", BASED ON 
THEIR DISRUPTION OF THE HAJJ, RATHER THAN UNDER THE 1988 
DECREE ON TERRORISM, SABOTAGE AND HIJACKING. 
 
-     C. SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT, IF ANY, FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, INCLUDING POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR 
TERRORISTS; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC 
RECOGNITION, MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER 
PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO 
TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON 
TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDING VOTING 
RECORDS: 
 
-       THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE POLITICAL 
OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND HAS 
REPEATEDLY SPOKEN AND VOTED AGAINST TERRORIST ACTS IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA.  SAUDI OFFICIALS MAKE A CAREFUL 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM AND SUPPORT OF 
THE PLO, WHICH THEY CONSIDER A LEGITIMATE NATIONAL 
LIBERATION MOVEMENT, AND WERE ONE OF THE FIRST 
GOVERNMENTS TO EXTEND RECOGNITION TO THE PALESTINIAN 
\"STATE.\"  WHILE SUPPORTING THE PLO BOTH POLITICALLY AND 
FINANCIALLY (INDEED, IT IS ONE OF THAT ORGANIZATION\'S 
LEADING DONORS), SAUDI ARABIA DECRYS ACTS OF TERRORISM 
ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED IN THE NAME OF THE PALESTINIAN 
CAUSE.  SAUDI ARABIA IS NOT A KNOWN SANCTUARY FOR 
TERRORISTS, NOR DOES IT MISUSE DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES TO 
SUPPORT TERRORIST GROUPS.

3. IN ADDITION TO INTENSIFIED INTERNAL SECURITY FOLLOWING 
THE EXECUTION OF THE MECCA BOMBERS, SOURCES CLOSE TO THE 
KING INDICATED THAT A BAN ON NON-OFFICIAL FOREIGN TRAVEL 
WAS IMPOSED ON ALL MEMBERS OF THE AL SAUD RULING FAMILY, 
SINCE HIZBULLAH HAD SPECIFICALLY THREATENED TO KILL 16 
MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY IN RETALIATION FOR THE 
EXECUTIONS.  ONE SENIOR PRINCESS WAS SAID HAVE ACTUALLY 
BEEN STOPPED AT THE AIRPORT WHEN SHE ATTEMPTED TO DEFY 
THE BAN.  THE INTENSIFIED INTERNAL SECURITY WAS NOT 
TOTALLY RELATED TO THESE THREATS, HOWEVER.  SAUDI AND 
EXPATRIATE SOURCES ALSO REPORTED AN UPSURGE IN HIGHWAY 
ROBBERY AND OTHER CRIME IN RURAL AREAS NEAR RIYADH, WHICH 
APPEARED TO BE ECONOMICALLY MOTIVATED. 
 
4.  SAUDI INTERIOR MINISTRY SOURCES INDICATED THAT THE 
DISSOLUTION OF THE ANTI-TERRORIST UNIT (AND THE PRIOR 
SACKING OF ITS CHIEF IN OCTOBER) WERE ALSO PARTLY DUE TO 
OFFICIAL DISSATISFACTION OVER THE FACT THAT ATU HAD 
FAILED TO PREVENT THE MECCA BOMBINGS, IN SPITE OF INTENSE 
SECURITY PRECAUTIONS DURING THE HAJJ IN MECCA AND 
SURROUNDING AREAS.

REF:  MOSCOW 19452 
 
1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2.  POST THANKS MOSCOW FOR ITS INTERESTING REPORT 
(REFTEL). TO PROVIDE A CONTEXT FOR THE \"IZVESTIYA\" 
INTERVIEW WITH TARIQ BIN LADEN AND ITS IMPACT ON SAUDI 
SOVIET TIES, POST PROVIDES FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON TARIQ 
AND THE BIN LADEN BUSINESS COMPANIES IN GENERAL. 
 
3.  THE BIN LADEN COMPANIES ARE AMONG THE LARGEST 
CONSTRUCTION FIRMS IN SAUDI ARABIA, WITH ESTIMATED 
HOLDINGS OF SAUDI RIYALS 38 BILLION ($10 BILLION).  BIN 
LADEN HAS THUS FAR CONCENTRATED ON INVESTMENT WITHIN 
SAUDI ARABIA, THOUGH THEY ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS JOINT 
VENTURES WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN COMPANIES.  THE 
COMPANIES ARE ESSENTIALLY FAMILY-RUN: SEVEN OF THE BIN 
LADEN BROTHERS FULLY CONTROL THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 
THEIR BUSINESS REPUTATION IS CONSIDERED EXCELLENT. 
 
4.  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SAG AND THE BIN LADEN 
COMPANIES IS A STRONG ONE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BIN 
LADEN\'S FAMILY TIES TO THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE 
COMPANIES\' LEADING ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE KINGDOM\'S 
INFRASTRUCTURE.  WHEN THE COMPANIES\' FOUNDER, SHAYKH 
MOHAMMED BIN LADEN DIED IN 1966, KING FAISAL SET UP A 
SORT OF ROYAL CHARTER FOR THE COMPANY WHICH KEPT THE 
COMPANY AFLOAT BY GUARANTEEING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND 
SETTING UP A SPECIAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ADMINISTER THE 
COMPANY UNTIL THE BIN LADEN SONS CAME OF AGE.  THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO ENTRUSTED BIN LADEN WITH A MAJOR 
SHARE IN THE RENOVATION OF THE TWO HOLY MOSQUES IN MECCA 
AND MADINAH.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE FIRMS\' NUMBER TWO 
MAN, SHAYKH BAKR BIN LADEN, HAS DIRECT PERSONAL TIES WITH 
KING FAHD. 
 
5.  TARIQ M. BIN LADEN IS NOT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
OF THE BIN LADEN COMPANIES, THOUGH HE DOES RUN A LARGE 
SUBSIDIARY BRANCH.  LIKE HIS BROTHERS, TARIQ MAINTAINS 
CLOSE RELATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.  AT 43, 
HE IS ONE OF THE ELDEST BROTHERS OF THE BIN LADEN CLAN. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  BECAUSE OF TARIQ\'S SENIOR POSITION AMONG 
THE BIN LADEN ELITE AND HIS TIES TO THE ROYAL FAMILY, HIS 
VISIT TO MOSCOW MAY BE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THAT OF A 
SIMPLE BUSINESS VISIT.  IT IS LIKELY THAT HE CONSULTED 
WITH SAG OFFICIALS BEFORE LEAVING THE KINGDOM AND WILL 
REPORT BACK TO THEM UPON HIS RETURN.  TARIQ MAY ENVISION 
A ROLE FOR HIMSELF IN FUTURE FINANCIAL COOPERATION 
BETWEEN THE USSR AND THE ARAB BUSINESS COMMUNITY THROUGH 
HIS CORPORATE TIES WITH THE SAUDI-CAIRO BANK. 
 
7.  A CLOSER CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SAG AND MOSCOW IS NOT 
NECESSARILY A NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT.  AN INCREASED SAUDI 
PRESENCE AMONG THE MUSLIM POPULATIONS THROUGH ECONOMIC 
AND RELIGIOUS TIES COULD ACT AS A GUARD AGAINST IRANIAN 
INFLUENCE. 
 
8.  NOTE: WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN A COPY OF TARIQ\'S 
SPEECH AND WILL SEND IT TO MOSCOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

ON AUGUST 1.  THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPOSITE SUMMARY OF 
THIS MORNING\'S (AUGUST 1) LOCAL PRESS REPORTING.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  BILATERAL TALKS BETWEEN IRAQ AND KUWAIT STARTED AT 
THE JEDDAH CONFERENCE PALACE JULY 31, 1990.  VICE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE IRAQI REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL IZZAT 
IBRAHIM LED THE IRAQI DELEGATION TO THE TALKS WHILE 
KUWAITI CROWN PRINCE AND PRIME MINISTER SAAD AL-ABDALLAH 
LED HIS COUNTRY\'S TEAM.  THE IRAQI TEAM COMPRISES MEMBER 
OF THE IRAQI RCC DR. SAADOUN HAMMADI (FORMER MINISTER OF

A NUMBER OF IRAQI TOP OFFICIALS.  THE KUWAITI DELEGATION 
INCLUDES MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS NASSER 
AL-SABAH; MINISTER OF JUSTICE DARI ABDALLAH AL-OTHMAN; 
OIL MINISTER DR. RASHID SALEM AL-OMERY AND OTHER 
OFFICIALS.  (NEITHER KUWAITI FOREIGN MINISTER SABAH 
AL-AHMAD AL-JABER NOR HIS IRAQI COUNTERPART TARIQ AZIZ 
APPEARED AMONG THE TWO TEAMS.) 
 
3.  CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH RECEIVED AZIZ AND SAAD 
AL-ABDALLAH ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT JEDDAH AIRPORT.  WHILE 
AZIZ DID NOT MAKE ANY STATEMENT ON HIS ARRIVAL SAAD 
AL-ABDALLAH MADE A STATEMENT IN WHICH HE SAID HE MUST 
REGISTER HIS THANKS TO THE ARAB LEADERS FOR THEIR SINCERE 
EFFORTS FOR CONTAINMENT OF THE TRANSIENT DISPUTE BETWEEN 
IRAQ AND KUWAIT.  HE THANKED IN PARTICULAR KING FAHD AND 
MUBARAK WHO HAD PAVED THE WAY FOR THE JEDDAH MEETING.  HE 
SAID, \"I LOOK FORWARD WITH OPEN HEART TO MEETING WITH MY 
BROTHER IZZAT IBRAHIM AND I UNDERLINE THE INTEREST OF 
KUWAIT IN PARTICIPATING POSITIVELY IN THIS MEETING HOPING 
THAT IT WOULD CONSTITUTE A BASIC STEP TOWARD REACHING A 
FINAL AND JUST RESOLUTION OF ALL OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS AND 
ISSUES BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERLY COUNTRIES.\" 
 
4.  KING FAHD RECEIVED IZZAT IBRAHIM AND SAAD AL-ABDALLAH 
IN THE PRESENCE OF CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH WHO ATTENDED THE 
OPENING SESSION OF THE BILATERAL TALKS.  KING FAHD WISHED 
THE TWO DELEGATIONS SUCCESS AND BEST WISHES. 
 
5.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPENING SESSION, IZZAT IBRAHIM 
AND SHEIKH SAAD AL-ABDALLAH HELD A CLOSED SESSION ALONE. 
AFTER APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS, HAMMADI AND ALI HASSAN 
AL-MAJID (MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT) JOINED THE IRAQI 
SIDE WHILE NASSER AL-SABAH AND DARI ABDALLAH AL-OTHMAN 
REPORTEDLY JOINED THE KUWAITI SIDE.  NO OFFICIAL 
STATEMENTS WERE MADE AFTER YESTERDAY\'S ROUND OF TALKS.

REPORTEDLY SAID THAT THEY WILL COMPLETE THEIR WORK TODAY, 
HOWEVER. 
 
6.  KING FAHD GAVE A DINNER IN HONOR OF THE TWO 
DELEGATIONS AT AL-HAMRA GUEST PALACE.  CROWN PRINCE 
ABDALLAH; PRINCE ABDULRAHMAN BIN ABDULAZIZ; PRINCE 
MITTEB; PRINCE BADR; PRINCE FAWWAZ AND PRINCE MAJID (ALL 
BROTHERS OF THE KING) ATTENDED THE DINNER. 
 
 
7.  SAUDI PRESS COMMENTS 
 
SAUDI PRESS EDITORIAL COMMENTS ON THE JEDDAH MEETING WERE 
HEAVY ON RHETORIC.  WRITERS HEAPED PRAISE ON THE 
\"HISTORIC\" ROLE OF KING FAHD FOR PAVING THE WAY FOR THE 
MEETING RATHER THAN COMMENTING ON THE DISPUTE ITSELF. 
EXCERPTS FROM TODAY\'S EDITORIALS: 
 
AL-NADWA 
-------- 
 
WE ARE QUITE CONFIDENT THAT THE KUWAITI AND IRAQI 
BROTHERS, WHO ARE WELL-KNOWN FOR THEIR CONSTRUCTIVE ROLES 
IN SEEING THE ISSUES OF THEIR NATION WILL NOT PERMIT THE 
CONSPIRATORS TO INTERFERE IN THE DISPUTES BETWEEN THE TWO 
COUNTRIES SO AS TO INFLATE SUCH A DISPUTE.  WE MUST 
UNDERLINE THAT ARAB NATION AS A WHOLE ATTACHES GREAT 
HOPES TO THE JEDDAH BROTHERLY MEETING.  THE ARAB NATION 
IS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE 
IRAQI-KUWAITI DISPUTE. 
 
AL-YAUM 
------- 
 
THE JEDDAH MEETING IS A PRACTICAL STEP FOR BYPASSING ALL 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS IRAQ AND KUWAIT. 
THIS STEP WILL DEFINITELY LEAD TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE 
AMBITIONS OF THE ARAB LEADERS FOR KEEPING THE ARAB NATION 
AWAY FROM ANY DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT IMPEDE THE PROCESS 
OF ARAB SOLIDARITY. 
 
AL-JAZEERA 
---------- 
 
HOSTING BY THE KINGDOM OF THE JEDDAH MEETING, AS SHEIKH 
ABDALLAH PUT IT, CONFIRMS THE PERMANENT INTEREST OF THE 
KINGDOM IN PLAYING ITS PIONEERING HISTORIC ROLE TO 
CONFRONT ALL ISSUES OF THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC NATIONS AND 
TO WORK SERIOUSLY FOR UNIFICATION OF THE WORD OF THIS 
NATION. 
 
AL-JAZEERA, JASSER AL-JASSER 
---------------------------- 
 
THE QUICK POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THE EFFORTS OF THE ARAB 
LEADERS FOR CONTAINMENT OF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN IRAQ AN 
KUWAIT POINTS OUT TWO FACTS: STRENGTH OF THE ARAB TIES 
AND CONFIDENCE OF THE ARAB NATION IN THE PRUDENCE OF ITS 
LEADERS. 
 
 
8.  AL-RIYADH DAILY QUOTED THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS FROM 
THE IRAQI AND KUWAITI NEWSPAPERS: 
 
AL-QABAS (KUWAIT) 
----------------- 
 
ALL SINCERE ARABS, IN THE FOREFRONT BEING THE PEOPLE OF 
KUWAIT, HOLD GREAT HOPE THAT THE JEDDAH MEETING WOULD BE 
THE MOTIVE FOR CONSOLIDATING THE BROTHERLY TIES BETWEEN 
IRAQ AND KUWAIT.  WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE WORLD WILL 
COME TO KNOW THAT OUR NATION IS CAPABLE OF WORKING OUT 
ITS PROBLEM BY ITSELF. 
 
AL-RAI AL-AAM (KUWAIT) 
---------------------- 
 
ALL EYES ARE SET ON JEDDAH HOPING FOR SUCCESS OF THE 
IRAQ-KUWAIT MEETING.  THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS BETWEEN 
KUWAIT AND IRAQ WERE TRANSIENT AND WE ARE SURE THAT THE 
JEDDAH MEETING WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL ONE. 
 
AL-QADESEYA (IRAQ) 
------------------ 
 
IRAQ RESPONDED TO THE JEDDAH MEETING IN ORDER TO PRESERVE 
THE HIGHER ARAB INTERESTS AND IN APPRECIATION TO THE 
EFFORTS OF THE ARAB LEADERS.  THE PAPER POINTED OUT THAT 
THE MEETING BETWEEN IRAQ AND KUWAIT IS A CHANCE FOR 
LIQUIDATING THE DIFFERENCES AND BEEFING UP THE 
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. 
 
 
9.  BBC ARABIC SERVICE REPORTED JULY 31 THAT IRAQI PRESS 
LAUNCHED A VEHEMENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST KUWAIT AND SAID 
AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT IRAQ\'S INTERESTS ARE ABOVE ARAB 
SOLIDARITY.

WITHDRAW FROM KUWAIT IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY. 
FAHD ALSO PUBLICLY THANKED THE \"U.S., UK AND OTHER 
FRIENDLY COUNTRIES\" WHICH ARE RESPONDING TO SAUDI 
ARABIA\'S CALL FOR DEFENSIVE MILITARY ASSISTANCE.  FAHD\'S 
SPEECH IS UNPRECEDENTED FOR ITS CANDOR AND 
STRAIGHTFORWARD PRAISE OF TWO WESTERN COUNTRIES.  IT 
SHOWS HOW MUCH THE CURRENT CRISIS HAS CHANGED SAUDI 
ARABIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THE SPEECH 
WILL ENABLE FAHD TO MANAGE DOMESTIC REACTION TO THE 
INTRODUCTION OF U.S. TROOPS FOR SOME TIME, BUT NOT 
INDEFINITELY.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (U) THIS AFTERNOON\'S NEWS BROADCAST ON SAUDI 
TELEVISION CARRIED A PERSONAL STATEMENT BY KING FAHD ON 
THE CURRENT CRISIS.  WEARING TINTED GLASSES AND CASTING 
HIS EYES DOWNWARD AT HIS PREPARED TET THROUGHOUT, FAHD 
DELIVERED HIS BRIEF (APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTE) SPEECH 
RAPIDLY, IN A SOMBER TONE OF VOICE. 
 
3.  (U) WE WILL RELY ON FBIS TO PROVIDE THE FULL TEXT OF 
FAHD\'S REMARKS.  THE POINTS WE WISH TO HIGHLIGHT ARE: 
 
--    FAHD BEGAN BY REVIEWING THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO 
AUGUST 2, STRESSING ALL THE EFFORTS (BILATERAL CONTACTS, 
JEDDAH MEETING ETC.) WHICH SAUDI ARABIA UNDERTOOK FOR THE 
COMMON GOOD TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE BETWEEN IRAQ AND KUWAIT 
AND TO PREVENT AN OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE; 
 
--    FAHD THEN TURNED TO THE IRAQI INVASION ITSELF.  HE 
CALLED IT THE \"MOST VICIOUS\" (ABSHAA) AGGRESSION OF 
MODERN ARAB HISTORY AND NOTED THAT IT HAD PRECIPITATED A 
CRISIS FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. 
 
--    NEXT, FAHD ENUMERATED THE CALLS BY THE UNSC, ARAB 
LEAGUE, GCC ETC. FOR IRAQI WITHDRAWAL FROM KUWAIT 
IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AND THE RESTORATION OF 
THE GOVERNMENT OF SHAYKH JABIR.  HE UNEQUIVOCALLY ADDED 
SAUDI ARABIA\'S NAME TO THIS LIST. 
 
--    FAHD THEN PRAISED EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S CALL 
FOR AN EMERGENCY ARAB SUMMIT, SAYING THAT IT WOULD LEAD 
TO AN INCREASE IN ARAB SOLIDARITY. 
 
--    FINALLY, FAHD TURNED TO THE CRITICAL NEED TO 
PROTECT SAUDI ARABIA, ITS ECONOMY AND ALL THE 
ACHIEVEMENTS THAT IT HAS MADE IN RECENT YEARS.  HE NOTED 
THAT SAUDI ARABIA COULD NOT SUCCESSFULLY UNDERTAKE ITS 
DEFENSE BY ITSELF AND THEREFORE THE SAG HAD CALLED ON 
FRIENDLY COUNTRIES TO ASSIST IT. 
 
--    AT THIS POINT, FAHD THANKED THE \"U.S., UK AND OTHER 
FRIENDLY COUNTRIES\" WHICH HAD RESPONDED TO THE SAUDI 
REQUEST BY PROVIDING AIR AND GROUND FORCES FOR THE 
DEFENSE OF SAUDI ARABIA AND THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AND 
STABILITY FOR ALL THE STATES OF THE ARAB GULF REGION, 
YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW -- GOD WILLING.  HOWEVER, 
HE STRESSED THAT SUCH SUPPORT WOULD BE TEMPORARY, AND 
WOULD END IMMEDIATELY--AS SOON AS THE KINGDOM REQUESTED. 
 
COMMENT: 
------- 
 
4.  (C) AS REFTELS POINTED OUT, SAUDI MEDIA COVERAGE OF 
THE CRISIS HAS GRADUALLY BEEN GROWING MORE CANDID AND 
COMPLETE.  NOW THE KING HAS GONE ON RECORD PERSONALLY 
WITH A STATEMENT LAYING OUT CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENED, WHO IS 
RESPONSIBLE (ALTHOUGH HE DIDN\'T MENTION SADDAM BY NAME) 
AND WHAT THE SAUDI POSITION IS.  HE HAS ALSO CAST THE 
IRAQI INVASION AS A CRISIS FOR THE WHOLE WORLD (NOT JUST 
THE ARAB WORLD) AND MADE IT CLEAR TO THE SAUDI PUBLIC 
THAT IT IS A DIRECT THREAT TO SAUDI SECURITY. 
 
5.  (C) IN DOMESTIC POLITICAL TERMS, THE SPEECH WAS 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROVIDED A CLEAR, PUBLIC EXPLANATION 
FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF U.S. FORCES.  OUR RAPIDLY GROWING 
MILITARY PRESENCE HERE IS NO SECRET AND FAHD COULD ILL 
AFFORD TO WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE EXPLAINING SUCH A DRASTIC 
STEP TO HIS SUBJECTS.  NOW THAT HE HAS DONE SO AND 
EMPHASIZED THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF OUR SUPPORT, WE 
BELIEVE THAT THE DOMESTIC REACTION WILL BE MANAGEABLE FOR 
SOME TIME.  THIS WILL NOT LAST FOREVER, HOWEVER. 
 
6.  (C) ALTHOUGH SADDAM\'S KUWAIT BASHING AMUSED MANY 
SAUDIS AT FIRST, FAHD\'S SPEECH RELATING THE INVASION TO 
SAUDI ARABIA\'S OWN SECURITY SHOULD QUICKLY CHANGE PUBLIC 
ATTITUDES.  SADDAM IS HARDLY THE POPULAR FIGURE HERE THAT 
HE SEEMS TO BE IN SOME OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  SAUDI 
RELIGIOUS ELITES HAVE NO LOVE FOR SADDAM\'S SECULAR, 
BAATHIST SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY. 
 
7.  (C) ON THE OTHER HAND, RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES ALSO 
FEAR WESTERN CULTURAL INROADS INTO SAUDI ARABIA.  THE 
LONGER LARGE NUMBERS OF WESTERN TROOPS ARE PRESENT IN 
SAUDI ARABIA THE GREATER THOSE FEARS WILL BECOME. 
 
8.  (C) IMPORTANTLY FOR U.S./SAUDI RELATIONS, FAHD HAS 
PUBLICLY THANKED THE U.S. FOR RESPONDING TO SAUDI 
ARABIA\'S CALL FOR ASSISTANCE IN ITS DEFENSE.  WHILE NO 
ARAB WILL MISS THIS MESSAGE, IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT FAHD\'S 
STRESS ON THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE FOREIGN MILITARY 
PRESENCE HERE, THE DEFENSIVE POSTURE OF THAT PRESENCE, 
AND THE FACT THAT THE FRIENDLY FOREIGN FORCES WILL LEAVE 
IMMEDIATELY AT THE KINGDOM\'S REQUEST WAS MADE TO ALLAY 
CONCERNS BY MANY SAUDIS OVER THE MOTIVES OF THE GROWING 
U.S. BUILD-UP IN THE KINGDOM. 
 
9.  (C) NONETHELESS, FAHD HAS NOW OPENLY TIED THE U.S. 
AND THE KINGDOM TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF THE IRAQI 
MILITARY THREAT.  SADDAM MAY HAVE REDRAWN THE MAP OF THE 
MIDDLE EAST, BUT HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE ALL THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTIONS.  NOT ALL THE CHANGES ARE 
GOING TO BE TO HIS LIKING BY ANY MEANS. 
 
10.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

TAGS:  PTER, KPRP, SA 
SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: 1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 355397 
 
1.  THERE FOLLOWS DRAFT VERSION OF SAUDI ARABIAN 
COMPONENT OF THE 1990 REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, KEYED TO REFTEL. 
 
2.  A) DESCRIBE ANY HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS 
INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS 
OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: 
 
-     THERE WERE NO GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS FOR TERRORISM 
OR TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA IN 1990. 
 
-     B) DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION? 
 
-     AS THE RESULT OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THREE SAUDI 
DIPLOMATS IN BANGKOK ON FEBRUARY 1, THE THAI GOVERNMENT 
LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION WHICH RESULTED IN THE ARREST OF 
A NUMBER OF THAI SUBJECTS.  SAUDI AUTHORITIES PUBLICLY 
INDICATED A DESIRE TO QUESTION THE SUSPECTS THEMSELVES 
WHEN THE THAI GOVERNMENT COMPLETED ITS INVESTIGATION, 
BUT DID NOT FILE A FORMAL EXTRADITION REQUEST. 
 
-     C) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS: 
 
-     THERE ARE NO DOMESTIC IMPEDIMENTS TO SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT EXPRESSED IMPATIENCE 
WITH THE SLOW PACE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS NOTED UNDER 
ITEM B, BUT THAI OFFICIALS STATED THAT THIS WAS DUE TO 
PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE MISCARRIAGE OF 
JUSTICE.  THAI MUSLIM POLITICIANS ALSO CHARGED THE 
GOVERNMENT WITH PERSECUTING THAILAND\'S SHIA COMMUNITY, TO 
WHICH ALL OF THE DETAINED SUSPECTS WERE SAID TO BELONG, 
AND SAID THEY WOULD OPPOSE ANY ATTEMPT TO EXTRADITE THE 
SUSPECTS TO SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
-     D) DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN 
PROSECUTION.  THIS WOULD INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL 
NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A TERRORIST INCIDENT AND EFFORTS 
BY HOST GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR 
TO ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS: 
 
-     SAUDI OFFICIALS CONTINUED TO SPEAK OUT STRONGLY 
AGAINST TERRORISM AT EVERY APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY. 
IN ADDITION TO STRONG STATEMENTS CONDEMNING SEVERAL 
TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST SAUDIS ABROAD (SEE SECTION G), 
THE SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTRY PUBLISHED A REBUTTAL IN APRIL 
TO IRANIAN ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA, INCLUDING IN 
IT A LIST OF IRAN\'S MISDEEDS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS 
AND SPECIFICALLY PINNING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 1989 
MECCA BOMBINGS ON THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT.  THE SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT COOPERATED FULLY IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE 
MURDERS IN THAILAND, INCLUDING SENDING A SAUDI 
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO BANGKOK AND ALLOWING THAI 
INVESTIGATORS TO COME TO SAUDI ARABIA IN ORDER TO 
INTERVIEW FAMILIES AND COLLEAGUES OF THE SLAIN DIPLOMATS. 
 
-     E) DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS 
UNDERTAKEN IN 1990 BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING 
STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA: 
 
-     SAUDI SECURITY FORCES CONTINUED THEIR PREVIOUS 
LEVEL OF COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND 
WITH U.S. SECURITY AGENCIES IN 1990 ON INFORMATION 
EXCHANGE AND TRAINING PROGRAMS.  INTENSIVE, BUT LARGELY 
UNOBTRUSIVE, SECURITY PRECAUTIONS RESULTED IN THE HAJJ 
PASSING WITHOUT INCIDENT.  THE ONSET OF THE GULF CRISIS 
IN AUGUST LED TO INTENSIFIED INTERNAL SECURITY, IN WHICH 
SAUDI SECURITY PERSONNEL COOPERATED FULLY ON TACTICAL 
MILITARY MATTERS WITH U.S. MILITARY SECURITY AGENCIES. 
IN ADDITION, STARTING IN MARCH, THE SAUDIS TOOK STEPS TO 
TIGHTEN INTERNAL SECURITY BY IMPLEMENTING A PLAN TO 
IDENTIFY ILLEGAL RESIDENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND EITHER 
REGULARIZE THEIR STATUS OR DEPORT THEM.  DUE TO THE GULF 
CRISIS, THIS PROGRAM WAS ACCELERATED, TOGETHER WITH A 
REVOCATION OF SPECIAL PRIVILEGES HERETOFORE GRANTED TO 
YEMENI RESIDENTS IN THE COUNTRY; AS A RESULT, YEMENIS 
EITHER HAD TO OBTAIN A SAUDI SPONSOR, AS ALL OTHER 
NATIONALITIES HAD PREVIOUSLY DONE, OR EXIT THE COUNTRY. 
SAUDI AND KUWAITI SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS WORKED TOGETHER 
CLOSELY IN SCREENING REFUGEES FROM KUWAIT FOR POSSIBLE 
TERRORISTS TRYING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY IN DISGUISE. 
 
-     F) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT 
FOR TERRORISM, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL 
AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT 
THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION; MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC 
POUCH AND OTHER PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; 
SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS 
AND/OR THE PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF SUCH GROUPS; HOST 
GOVERNMENT TRAINING OR THE PROVISION OF TRAINING SITES TO 
TERRORIST GROUPS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON TERRORISM ISSUES 
IN INTERNATIONAL FORA: 
 
-     THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE POLITICAL OR 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND HAS 
REPEATEDLY SPOKEN AND VOTED AGAINST TERRORIST ACTS IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA.  SAUDI ARABIA MAKES A CAREFUL 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM AND SUPPORT FOR 
THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE, WHICH IT CONSIDERS A LEGITIMATE 
NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  SAUDI ARABIA RECOGNIZES 
THE PALESTINIAN \"STATE\" AS A GOVERNMENT, AND SUPPORTS THE 
INTIFADA BOTH POLITICALLY AND FINANCIALLY.  IN 1990 IT 
CONTINUED TO BE ONE OF THE PLO\'S LEADING DONORS. 
HOWEVER, IRRITATION OVER THE CURRENT PLO LEADERSHIP\'S 
SUPPORT OF IRAQ DURING THE GULF CRISIS APPEARS TO HAVE 
ENDED SAUDI SUPPORT FOR THAT ORGANIZATION FOR THE 
PRESENT.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DECRIES ACTS OF TERRORISM 
ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED IN THE NAME OF THE PALESTINIAN 
CAUSE.  SAUDI ARABIA IS NOT A KNOWN SANCTUARY FOR 
TERRORISTS, NOR DOES IT MISUSE DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES TO 
SUPPORT TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
-     G.  HAS THE HOST COUNTRY MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
IN FAVOR OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY (CUBA, IRAN, 
IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA AND SYRIA) ON A TERRORISM ISSUE? 
 
-     NO.  IN FACT, SAUDI AUTHORITIES REPEATEDLY 
CONDEMNED TERRORISM, BOTH IN THE CASE OF THE KILLINGS OF 
SAUDI DIPLOMATS AND IN GENERAL TERMS, AT INTERVALS 
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. 
 
-     H. DECRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1989, 
POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST COUNTRY\'S ATTITUDE 
TOWARDS TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? 
 
-     THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN SAUDI 
ARABIA\'S ATTITUDE REGARDING DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM SINCE 1989.  SAUDI OFFICIALS HAVE NEVER 
SUPPORTED TERRORISM BY EXTREME PALESTINIAN FACTIONS (AS 
OPPOSED TO THE INTIFADA, WHICH THEY CONSIDER A LEGITIMATE 
EXPRESSION OF OPPOSITION TO FOREIGN OCCUPATION AND MEANS 
OF PROVIDING PALESTINIAN NATIONAL LIBERATION), AND 
TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST PERSONS AND PROPERTY CONTINUE TO 
BE CAPITAL CRIMES UNDER SAUDI LAW.  MOREOVER, SAUDI 
ENTHUSIASM FOR THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION AND 
ITS CONSTITUENT GROUPS DIMINISHED MARKEDLY AS A RESULT OF 
THE CURRENT PLO LEADERSHIP\'S SUPPORT FOR IRAQ\'S INVASION 
OF KUWAIT.  OFFICIAL CONCERN ABOUT ATTACKS ON SAUDI 
OFFICIALS AND PROPERTY OVERSEAS CONTINUED TO DEEPEN IN 
1989-90 AS THE RESULT OF THE THAILAND KILLINGS, THE 
MURDER OF A SAUDI DIPLOMAT IN BEIRUT (OCTOBER 1989), 
BOMBINGS OF SAUDI OFFICIAL CARS IN ANKARA (IN OCTOBER 
1989 AND JANUARY 1990), ONE OF WHICH RESULTED IN THE 
MAIMING OF A SAUDI DIPLOMAT, AND THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING 
(AS PART OF AN EXTORTION ATTEMPT) OF A SAUDI AIRLINES 
FLIGHT FROM ISLAMABAD IN NOVEMBER 1989.

REF:  (A) RIYADH 1663 (NOTAL); (B) RIYADH 1724 (NOTAL); 
(C) RIYADH 1789 (NOTAL) 
 
1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE UNPRECEDENTED CONVENTION ON THE CONCEPT 
OF JIHAD AND ITS RELATION TO THE GULF CRISIS ENDED IN 
RIYADH FEBRUARY 20 AFTER THREE DAYS OF DISCUSSION BY 
PERHAPS THE MOST DIVERSE GATHERING EVER OF SAUDI 
RELIGIOUS, GOVERNMENT, AND MEDIA PERSONALITIES.  THE 
HOLDING OF THE CONVENTION WAS ITSELF A MAJOR STEP FORWARD 
IN THE KINGDOM\'S EFFORTS TO DEFINE THE TERMS OF DEBATE 
ABOUT THE GULF WAR IN BOTH SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES WITH MUSLIM POPULATIONS.  WITH A DAILY AUDIENCE 
OF MORE THAN 1000 PEOPLE, INCLUDING SOME 200 FOREIGN 
GUESTS WHOSE EXPENSES WERE COVERED BY SAUDI AUTHORITIES, 
AND WITH IN-DEPTH COVERAGE FROM ALL SAUDI MEDIA, THE SAG 
CLEARLY PUT FORTH ITS BEST POSSIBLE EFFORTS IN HELPING TO 
HOST AND ADMINISTER THE CONVENTION. 
 
3.  THE CONVENTION\'S MAJOR TOPICS OF DISCUSSION WERE 
GENERALLY THE SAME ONES PROMOTED BY THE SAG SINCE LAST 
AUGUST:  FINDING RELIGIOUS GROUNDS FOR ACTIONS AGAINST 
SADDAM, INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN FORCES IN THE 
KINGDOM; EXPLAINING POPULAR PERCEPTIONS OF THE CRISIS IN 
THE ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLD; AND DESCRIBING THE ROLES 
PLAYED BY LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA IN COVERAGE OF 
THE CRISIS.  ATTENDEES LEFT THE CONVENTION WITH THEIR OWN 
BELIEFS STRENGTHENED AND, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF 
FOREIGN GUESTS, AN INCREASED ABILITY TO SUPPORT SAG 
POSITIONS ON THE GULF WAR AND COUNTER IRAQI PROPAGANDA 
EFFORTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
4.  THIS IS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL REPORTS ON THE JIHAD 
CONVENTION AND PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF DISCUSSION DURING 
THE THREE DAYS.  OTHER REPORTS WILL FOCUS ON SPECIFIC 
ASPECTS OF THE CONVENTION AND REACTION BY PARTICIPANTS AS 
WELL AS OTHER SAUDIS. 
 
 
SAUDI PARTICIPANTS: THE GANG\'S ALL HERE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.  AS REPORTED REF A, A LEADING SAUDI ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY 
SERVED AS HOST FOR A THREE-DAY CONVENTION (MUHRAJAN) TO 
DISCUSS THE CONCEPT OF JIHAD AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE 
GULF WAR.  PRE-CONVENTION ANNOUNCEMENTS, HOWEVER, DID NOT 
MAKE CLEAR THE UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER AND SCOPE OF SAUDI 
LUMINARIES WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE SIX OFFICIAL 
SESSIONS.  THE CONFERENCE WAS OPENED BY DEFENSE MINISTER 
SULTAN, WHO READ A SPEECH BY KING FAHD (REF A) AND HELD 
AN IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE AFTERWARDS.  OTHER 
IMPORTANT SAUDIS AND FOREIGNERS ON STAGE FOR THE OPENING 
SESSION INCLUDED EDUCATION MINISTER ABDULLAH 
AL-KHUWAYTIR, OIC SECRETARY-GENERAL HAMID AL-GABID, 
EGYPTIAN GRAND MUFTI MOHAMMED SYED TANTAWI, AL-AZHAR 
VICE-PRESIDENT AHMED OMAR HASHEM, AND THE HOST OF THE 
CONFERENCE, DR. ABDALLAH BIN ABDULRAHMAN AL-TURKI, THE 
RECTOR OF IMAM MOHAMED BIN SAUD UNIVERSITY. 
 
 
RELIGIOUS AND ROYAL ATTENDANCE: EVEN BIN BAZ COMES OUT 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6.  PERHAPS THE GREATEST SURPRISE OF THE CONVENTION WAS 
THE REGULAR ATTENDANCE OF SENIOR SAUDI RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR 
SHAYKH ABDULAZIZ BIN ABDULLAH BIN BAZ.  SEATED ON 
SULTAN\'S RIGHT FOR THE OPENING SESSION AND IN THE FRONT 
ROW OF THE AUDITORIUM FOR THE SYMPOSIA WHICH FOLLOWED, 
THE ELDERLY AND BLIND BIN BAZ WAS QUICK TO MAKE 
CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE CONVENTION.  HE MADE THE 
THIRD SPEECH OF THE OPENING SESSION (FOLLOWING SULTAN AND 
DR. AL-TURKI) AND WAS REGULARLY INVITED TO MAKE CLOSING 
COMMENTS FOR ALL OTHER SESSIONS.  DURING A PRIVATE 
AUDIENCE OF FOREIGN GUESTS WITH KING FAHD AND CROWN 
PRINCE ABDULLAH (REF C), BIN BAZ EVEN INTERUPTED THE KING 
TO EXPOUND UPON RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE KINGDOM\'S 
GULF CRISIS POLICIES.  BIN BAZ WAS JOINED AT ALL SESSIONS 
OF THE CONVENTION BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME 
COUNCIL OF ULEMA, THE HIGHEST SAUDI RELIGIOUS BODY, AS 
WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER SAUDI RELIGIOUS FIGURES.  TO NO 
ONE\'S SURPRISE, MOST OF THE RELIGIOUS COMMENTARY REPEATED 
THE SAME CALLS OF SUPPORT FOR GOD AND KINGDOM HEARD IN 
THE EARLY DAYS OF THE CRISIS, ALTHOUGH A FEW AWKWARD 
MOMENTS PROVED THAT THE MOST SENIOR OFFICIALS WERE STILL 
UNFAMILIAR WITH THE INTRICACIES OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION 
BEFORE A LARGE GROUP (REPORTED SEPTEL). 
 
 
7.  ROYAL ATTENDEES WHO SPOKE AT VARIOUS SESSIONS 
INCLUDED SEVERAL REGULAR EMBASSY CONTACTS, SUCH AS MFA 
OFFICIAL (AND KING FAHD\'S SON-IN-LAW) DR. PRINCE TURKI 
BIN MOHAMMED SAUD AL-KABIR, DEPUTY INTERIOR MINISTER (AND 
POET) IBRAHIM AL-AWAJI, AND PETROLEUM MINISTRY ADVISOR 
PRINCE ABDULAZIZ BIN SALMAN.  AMONG THE MANY OTHER 
PROMINENT SAUDI SPEAKERS WERE OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRY 
OF INFORMATION, MILITARY AND CIVIL DEFENSE OFFICERS, 
POETS AND OTHER LITERATI, AND PRINT MEDIA EDITORS.  IN 
ADDITION, NUMEROUS VIP SEATS WERE OCCUPIED THROUGHOUT THE 
CONFERENCE BY MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY AND VARIOUS 
RELIGIOUS FIGURES, AND MINISTER OF INTERIOR PRICE NAYIF 
BIN ABD AL-AZIZ HOSTED A LUNCHEON FOR SELECTED 
PARTICIPANTS ON THE FINAL DAY. 
 
 
FOREIGN GUESTS: LITTLE SPEAKING TIME, ALL EXPENSES PAID 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
8.  FOREIGNERS ATTENDING THE CONVENTION WERE GENERALLY 
RESTRICTED TO SHORT COMMENTARIES ABOUT PRESENTATIONS BY 
SAUDIS ON THE SIX PANELS.  OF THE FEW FOREIGNERS GRANTED 
COMPARABLE SPEAKING TIME, THE BEST RECEIVED WERE THE 
WELL-KNOWN KUWAITI RELIGIOUS LEADER SHAYKH AHMED AL-QITAN 
(ONE OF THE FEW NON-SAUDIS SEATED ON STAGE AFTER THE 
OPENING SESSION) AND TWO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AFGHAN 
MUJAHIDEEN.  IN CONTRAST TO THE SOMEWHAT BLAND 
PRESENTATIONS MADE BY MOST SAUDI SPEAKERS, THE KUWAITI 
AND AFGHANIS HELD THE AUDIENCE\'S ATTENTION AND RECIEVED 
THE STRONGEST RESPONSES BY NOTING, RESPECTIVELY, THE 
ATROCITIES OF THE IRAQI MILITARY IN KUWAIT AND THE 
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN KUWAIT AND AFGHANISTAN. 
 
9.  NONETHELESS, THE NUMEROUS FOREIGN ATTENDEES SEEMED 
SATISFIED WITH THE CONFERENCE.  OUR EARLY ESTIMATES ARE 
THAT 15-20 OF THE 31 COUNTRIES INVITED SENT 
REPRESENTATIVES, APPARENTLY WITH ALL EXPENSES PAID BY THE 
SAG.  A WESTERN HEMISPHERE GROUP INCLUDED A TRINIDAD 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AS WELL AS SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES OF 
THE MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY (MAC).  OTHER COUNTRIES 
REPRESENTED INCLUDED MALAYSIA, NIGERIA, PAKISTAN, SUDAN, 
SYRIA, AND SPAIN. 
 
 
MEDIA: GOOD COVERAGE, BUT WANDERING DISCUSSIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
10.  MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES WERE VISIBLE DURING ALL 
PROCEEDINGS, WITH SAUDI TELEVISION PROVIDING LIVE 
COVERAGE OF SEVERAL SESSIONS AS WELL AS NUMEROUS 
INTERVIEWS WITH CONVENTION ATTENDEES.  LOCAL PRESS 
COVERAGE WAS SIMILARLY COMPLETE, WITH LONG QUOTES FROM A 
NUMBER OF PANELISTS APPEARING IN SEVERAL ARABIC DAILIES. 
FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WERE NOT VISIBLE DURING MOST OF THE 
CONFERENCE, ALTHOUGH THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PRINTED 
MATERIAL AND TRANSLATION SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE WILL 
PROBABLY HELP TO DISSEMINATE CONFERENCE RESULTS. 
 
11.  DISCUSSION OF GULF CRISIS MEDIA COVERAGE WAS 
SOMEWHAT LESS THAN EXCELLENT, HOWEVER, AS PANELISTS OFTEN 
CONTRADICTED THEMSELVES AND ONE ANOTHER ABOUT THE BEST 
WAY TO RESPOND TO IRAQI PROPAGANDA.  SPECULATIONS BY A 
NUMBER OF PANELISTS ABOUT THE SOURCES OF SADDAM\'S SUPPORT 
IN OTHER COUNTRIES WERE INCONCLUSIVE, AS WERE DISCUSSIONS 
REGARDING THE OVERALL ROLE OF ARAB AND WESTERN MEDIA IN 
THE CRISIS (REPORTED SEPTEL). 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12.  THE HOLDING OF THE CONVENTION MAY ITSELF PROVE TO BE 
ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT RESULT OVER THE LONG TERM.  WHILE 
FURTHER EVALUATION OF THE CONVENTION\'S IMPORT WILL TAKE 
SOME TIME TO EMERGE, ATTENDANCE BY SUCH A WIDE RANGE OF 
SAUDI LUMINARIES COULD HAVE POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR 
FUTURE PUBLIC DEBATE OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES, 
PERHAPS EVEN BEYOND THE END OF SADDAM\'S WAR.  MOREOVER, 
DECISIONS TO HOLD THE CONVENTION IN RIYADH AND CONVENE A 
NUMBER OF PANELS ON NON-RELIGIOUS THEMES MADE FOR FAR 
MORE INTERESTING DISCUSSION THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE 
IN THE MORE TYPICAL CONFERENCE VENUES OF MECCA OR MEDINA.

SUBJECT:  ISLAM AT THE JIHAD CONVENTION 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY: WHILE ISLAM WAS A CENTRAL SUBJECT AT 
LAST WEEK\'S JIHAD CONVENTION IN RIYADH, DISCUSSIONS 
GENERALLY REPEATED THE SAME POINTS EMPHASIZED BY SAUDI 
RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES SINCE LAST AUGUST.  THE IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT, AND ESPECIALLY THE BAATH PARTY, WERE ROUNDLY 
CONDEMNED BY ALL SPEAKERS, ALTHOUGH ONLY A FEW HAD 
SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN.  ALL SPEAKERS 
ALSO HAD STRONG PRAISE FOR THE AL SAUD AND THE COALITION 
EFFORT, AND ALL LISTED THE NUMEROUS REWARDS FOR THOSE WHO 
WAGED OR SUPPORTED JIHAD.  THE ONLY CONTROVERSIAL MOMENT 
CAME WHEN AN ANONYMOUS WRITTEN COMMENT SUGGESTED THAT 
MOST ISLAMIC SCHOLARS IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES SUPPORT 
SADDAM.  AFTER ONE SHEIKH TRIED TO BLAME JEALOUSY OF 
SAUDI WEALTH AND IRAQI PROPAGANDA FOR SUCH SUPPORT, TWO 
SENIOR SAUDI RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARGUED STRONGLY THAT MOST 
SCHOLARS IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES IN FACT SUPPORT SAUDI 
ARABIA.  NONETHELESS, THE STYLE AND SUBSTANCE OF 
DISCUSSION SEEMED TO REFLECT UNITED SUPPORT FOR SAG 
POSITIONS ON THE GULF CRISIS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  ALMOST ANY LARGE MEETING IN SAUDI ARABIA WILL 
INVOKE ISLAM AS A PRINCIPLE THEME, AND THE RECENT JIHAD 
CONVENTION AT RIYADH\'S IMAM MOHAMED BIN SAUD ISLAMIC 
UNIVERSITY WAS NO EXCEPTION.  AS EXPECTED, ALL SESSIONS 
AND SPEAKERS MENTIONED THE PROPERLY ISLAMIC NATURE OF THE 
KINGDOM\'S CURRENT JIHAD.  COMMENT: IT IS WORTH RECALLING 
THAT, WHILE JIHAD IS USUALLY TRANSLATED AS \"HOLY WAR,\" 
ITS MORE LITERAL MEANING IS THAT OF \"STRUGGLE.\"  AMONG 
MANY SUNNI POPULATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE CONSERVATIVE 
WAHHABI CIRCLES OF SAUDI ARABIA, JIHAD CAN ALSO DESCRIBE 
THE EFFORTS OF MUSLIMS TO FOLLOW ISLAM DURING A 
PARTICULARLY TRYING TIME OR SITUATION.  BOTH THESE 
RELATED USES OF JIHAD WERE IN EVIDENCE THROUGHOUT THE 
CONVENTION.  END COMMENT. 
 
3.  (U)  THE MOST DIRECT COMMENTS ON ISLAM WERE MADE 
DURING A PANEL DISCUSSION ENTITLED \"JIHAD IN THE GULF IS 
A DEFENSE OF RELIGION AND THE HOLY PLACES.\"  THREE SENIOR 
MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS 
(ULEMA) WERE ON THE PANEL: SHEIKH SALEH BIN MOHAMMAD 
AL-LEHEIDAN, SHEIKH ABDULAZIZ BIN ABDULLAH AL ASH-SHEIKH, 
AND SHEIKH SALEH BIN FAWZAN AL-FAWZAN.  OTHER 
PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED: SHEIKH MANNA AL-QAHTAN, A 
NATURALIZED SAUDI FROM SYRIA; KUWAITI SHEIKH AHMAD 
AL-QAHTAN (NO RELATION TO MANNA), ONE OF THE BEST-KNOWN 
RELIGIOUS SPEAKERS IN THE GULF REGION; SHEIKH MOHAMMED 
ABDALLAH AS-SUBAYYEL, DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE MINISTRY OF 
HAJJ AND ENDOWMENTS\' DEPARTMENT FOR AFFAIRS OF THE TWO 
HOLY MOSQUES; AND DR. ABDALLAH BIN MOHAMED AL-AJLAN OF 
THE IMAM MOHAMED UNIVERSITY FACULTY.  ANOTHER FACULTY 
MEMBER, DR. RASHED BIN RAJIH AL-RAJIH, SERVED AS 
MODERATOR.  NUMEROUS OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS WERE IN THE 
AUDIENCE, INCLUDING UNIVERSITY RECTOR DR. ABDALLAH BIN 
ABDULMOHSEN AL-TURKI AND SENIOR SAUDI RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR 
ABDULAZIZ BIN ABDALLAH BIN BAZ. 
 
4.  (U)  THE THREE SUPREME COUNCIL MEMBERS STRESSED THE 
SAME THEMES THAT THEY HAVE IN VIRTUALLY ALL THEIR PUBLIC 
APPEARANCES SINCE LAST AUGUST.  ALL WERE QUICK TO 
CRITICIZE THE \"EVIL\" IRAQI ACTIONS IN BOTH IRAQ AND 
KUWAIT SINCE THE INVASION, GENERALLY PLACING BLAME FOR 
ALL PROBLEMS WITH THE \"ATHEIST\" BAATH PARTY AND ONLY 
OCCASIONNALLY MENTIONING KUWAIT OR SADDAM.  AS-SUBAYYEL 
REMINDED THE AUDIENCE SEVERAL TIMES THAT JIHAD IS FOUGHT 
NOT ONLY THROUGH ACTION BUT THROUGH DEED AND THOUGHT AS 
WELL.  AL-LEHEIDAN, WHOSE PERIODIC APPEARANCES ON SAUDI 
TV AND RADIO SINCE AUGUST HAVE BEEN WELL-RECEIVED, WAS 
ATYPICALLY GENERAL IN HIS REMARKS, STRESSING THE REWARDS 
FOR THOSE WHO BECOME MARTYRS DURING JIHAD.  AL ASH-SHEIKH 
POINTED OUT THAT THE IRAQI BAATHISTS HAD ACHIEVED WHAT 
THE CHRISTIANS AND JEWS NEVER COULD: THE \"DISINTEGRATION\" 
OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  OTHER SWEEPING CONDEMNATIONS WERE 
MADE OF SOCIALISM AND PAN-ARABISM, AND SOME SPEAKERS 
(NOTABLY DR. AL-AJLAN) STRESSED THE NEED FOR A 
REUNIFICATION OF ALL THE MUSLIM NATIONS. 
 
5.  (U) THE BEST-RECEIVED OF THE SPEAKERS WAS 
UNQUESTIONABLY SHEIKH AHMED AL-QAHTAN OF KUWAIT.  LIKE 
HIS FIRE-AND-BRIMSTONE TAPES CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE 
GULF STATES, AL-QAHTAN WAS MUCH LOUDER, MORE FORCEFUL AND 
DIRECT THAN HIS SAUDI COLLEAGUES.  HE SAID THE AFGHANS 
AND PALESTINIANS WERE THE MAIN VICTIMS OF SADDAM AND THAT 
ISRAEL WOULD BE THE ONLY WINNER OF THE WAR.  HE SAID 
ISRAEL HAD RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL AID FROM THE U.S., 
GERMANY, AND JAPAN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CRISIS, AND 
CONTRASTED THAT SUPPORT TO THE LOST SIXTEEN MILLION 
DOLLARS A MONTH THAT THE PALESTINIANS USED TO RECEIVE 
FROM SAUDI ARABIA.  AL-QAHTAN CONCLUDED WITH A STATEMENT 
HE SAID WAS MADE BY KING ABDULAZIZ AL SAUD IN 1933:  \"I 
DO NOT FEAR THE FOREIGNERS AS I FEAR THE MUSLIMS BECAUSE 
OUR PROBLEMS WILL COME FROM THE MUSLIMS.\" 
 
6.  (U)  ENSUING COMMENTARY FROM THE FLOOR OF THE 
CONVENTION WAS MADE BY VARIOUS FOREIGN GUESTS WHO 
REPEATEDLY PRAISED THE AL SAUD IN GENERAL AND KING FAHD 
IN PARTICULAR.  ONE SUDANESE DELEGATE PRAISED KING 
ABDULAZIZ FOR \"CIVILIZING THE BEDOUIN\" BY TEACHING THEM 
MODERN WAYS, A COMMENT NOT WELCOMED BY THE 
TRADITIONALLY-MINDED AUDIENCE.  ANOTHER SOURCE OF 
DISCOMFORT FOR THE CONSERVATIVES ATTENDING WAS THE 
ASSERTION BY EGYPTIAN PROFESSOR DR. MUSTAFA ASH-SHAKA 
THAT THE CURRENT PROBLEM WAS NOT WITH SADDAM BUT WITH THE 
PROCESS WHICH BROUGHT SADDAM TO POWER.  HE SAID THAT 
SIMILAR MEN WOULD RISE TO POWER IF PRINCIPLES OF 
\"CONSULTATION\" (SHURA) WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT 
THE MUSLIM WORLD. 
 
7.  (U)  AFTERWARDS, WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED 
ANONYMOUSLY FROM THE AUDIENCE WERE READ, WITH ANSWERS 
PROVIDED BY PANEL MEMBERS.  ONE QUESTION ASKED FOR AN 
EXPLANATION OF THE PRO-SADDAM POSITION TAKEN BY MOST 
ULEMA OUTSIDE SAUDI ARABIA.  AFTER AS-SUBAYYEL ATTRIBUTED 
SUCH POSITIONS TO TRICKERY BY SADDAM OR ENVY OF SAUDI 
WEALTH, DR. AL-TURKI INTERRUPTED TO SAY THAT MOST ULEMA 
OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM IN FACT DID NOT SUPPORT SADDAM.  HE 
ASCRIBED REPORTS OF ANTI-SAUDI FEELING IN OTHER COUNTRIES 
TO WESTERN MEDIA DISTORTIONS AND TO THE PRO-SADDAM 
POSITION TAKEN BY SOME GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION.  SHEIKH 
BIN BAZ ALSO DENIED THE PREMISE OF THE QUESTION, SAYING 
THAT HE DAILY RECEIVED CABLES FROM ULEMA ALL OVER THE 
WORLD IN SUPPORT OF SAUDI POSITIONS AND ACTIVITIES.  BIN 
BAZ REPEATED THE RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATION FOR MUSLIMS TO 
SEEK THE ASSISTANCE OF NON-MUSLIMS FOR A JIHAD. 
 
8.  (U) OTHER SESSIONS OF THE CONFERENCE REPEATED MANY OF 
THE POINTS MENTIONED ABOVE, TYING THEM INTO THE TOPIC AT 
HAND.  AMONG THE MORE IMAGINATIVE ARGUMENTS WAS A CLAIM 
THAT BAATH PARTY FOUNDER MICHEL AFLAQ WAS A JEW; 
THEREFORE, SAID THE SPEAKER, THE BAATH PARTY WAS ONE OF 
THE GREATEST DANGERS CURRENTLY FACING THE MUSLIM WORLD. 
OTHERS WERE MORE CIRCUMSPECT IN THEIR CRITICISMS, 
GENERALLY ARGUING THAT SADDAM\'S WAR HAS DISTRACTED THE 
MUSLIMS FROM OTHER PROBLEMS FACED BY MUSLIMS IN 
AFGHANISTAN OR THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. 
 
9.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE SLIGHTLY CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS 
DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY EXTREME AND, LIKE 
THE ENTIRE CONVENTION, ARE MOST NOTEWORTHY IN THAT THEY 
HAPPENED AT ALL.  THE COMMENTS BY THE EGYPTIAN AND 
SUDANESE DELEGATES SHOW THAT FOREIGNERS WERE NOT 
PROHIBITED FROM SPEAKING THEIR MINDS, ALTHOUGH THE 
PROFESSOR CAREFULLY AVOIDED USING THE WORD \"DEMOCRACY\" IN 
HIS TALK.  IN MOST OTHER WAYS, THOUGH, THE DISCUSSION WAS 
TYPICALLY SAUDI, WITH QURANIC INVECTIVE MIXED AMONG CALLS 
FOR MUSLIM STEADFASTNESS IN THE MODERN WORLD (SOMETIMES 
WITH CORRESPONDING CALLS TO OPPOSE ZIONISM AND 
IMPERIALISM). 
 
10.  (C)  OF SOMEWHAT GREATER INTEREST WAS THE INTERPLAY 
BETWEEN THE RELIGIOUS FIGURES AT THE CONVENTION, 
ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THOSE ON THE PANEL AND BIN BAZ. 
UNLIKE THE PANEL OF MEDIA FIGURES (REPORTED SEPTEL), 
MEMBERS OF THE RELIGIOUS PANEL NEVER OPENLY DISAGREED 
WITH ONE ANOTHER.  AT MOST, THEY RAISED SUPPLEMENTAL 
POINTS THROUGH THE USE OF SOMEWHAT NEBULOUS ANALOGIES OR 
QURANIC REFERENCES.  BIN BAZ RECEIVED FAR MORE RESPECT 
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDITORIUM, SOMETIMES 
INTERRUPTING TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL QURANIC REFERENCE AND 
SOMETIMES BEING CALLED ON BY THE MODERATOR FOR 
COMMENTARY.  BOTH THE MODERATOR AND THE PANEL REFERRED TO 
BIN BAZ AS \"OUR FATHER\" (WALIDNA) AND WERE ALWAYS READY 
WITH EFFUSIVE PRAISE FOR POINTS RAISED BY THE SENIOR 
SHEIKH.

2.  SUMMARY.  THIS CABLE GIVES BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF 
SAUDI DAILY NEWSPAPERS, THEIR INDIVIDUAL ORIGINS, SPECIAL 
SLANTS, AND ESTIMATED CIRCULATION FIGURES.  (ONLY 
\"AL-HAYAT,\" A SAUDI-CONTROLLED DAILY PUBLISHED IN LONDON 
IS NOT INCLUDED).  REF A DESCRIBED THE STRUCTURE OF THE 
SAUDI PRESS ESTABLISHMENT, SOCIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL 
INHIBITORS ON PRESS FREEDOM, AND THE POSSIBLE LOCAL 
IMPACT OF THE INVASION OF SAUDI ARABIA BY THE FOREIGN 
PRESS DURING OPERATIONS DESERT SHIELD/STORM.  REF B

3.  \"AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT\" (SAUDI-OWNED, LONDON-BASED, 
MODERATE, INTERNAL CIRCULATION: 100,000-125,000, 
INTERNATIONAL CIRCULATION: 200,000-300,000).  FOUNDED IN 
1977, \"AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT\" IS SAUDI ARABIA\'S MOST 
INFLUENTIAL PUBLICATION AND ARGUABLY ONE OF THE TWO OR 
THREE MOST INFLUENTIAL NEWSPAPERS IN THE ARAB WORLD. 
\"AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT\" IS PRINTED IN RIYADH, JEDDAH, CAIRO, 
DHAHRAN, CASABLANCA, LONDON, FRANKFURT, MARSEILLE, PARIS, 
AND NEW YORK.  OWNERS OF RECORD ARE THE AL-HAFIZ FAMILY, 
BUT THE GOVERNOR OF RIYADH, PRINCE SALMAN BIN ABDUL AZIZ 
AL SAUD (A FULL BROTHER OF KING FAHD) IS RUMORED TO BE A 
MAJOR BEHIND-THE-SCENES INVESTOR IN THE PAPER.  \"AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT\'S\" INFLUENCE IS MORE RELATED TO THE GLOBAL REACH 
OF THE PAPER THAN THE COLORFULNESS OF ITS EDITORIAL 
WRITING, BUT A FEW WRITERS (NOTABLY SAUDI AMBASSADOR TO 
BAHRAIN, GHAZI AL-GOSAIBI) HAVE DEVOTED FOLLOWINGS.  THE 
PAPER FREQUENTLY TAKES A MORE MODERATE STANCE ON 
ARAB-ISRAELI ISSUES THAN OTHER SAUDI NEWSPAPERS 
REFLECTING THE DIFFERING VIEWS AND MORE COSMOPOLITAN 
NATURE OF ITS INTERNATIONAL READERSHIP. 
 
4.  \"UKAZ\" (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, ESTIMATED 
CIRCULATION: 110,000-125,000).  SISTER PAPER OF THE 
\"SAUDI GAZETTE.\"  FOUNDED IN 1960, \"UKAZ\" IS THE MOST 
POPULAR PAPER IN THE HIJAZ AND THE MOST WIDELY-CIRCULATED 
DAILY IN SAUDI ARABIA DUE TO DECLINING COMPETITION FROM 
OTHER HIJAZI PAPERS.  IN MID-1980S, \"UKAZ\" WAS OFTEN 
PERCEIVED AS A NEWSPAPER IN DECLINE DUE TO FAILURE TO 
INVEST IN MODERNIZATION, BUT HAS INVESTED IN IMPROVED 
PRINTING FACILITIES AND STEADILY EXPANDED CIRCULATION. 
DURING NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1990, THE SAUDI PRESS LURCHED 
TOWARDS SENSATIONALISM AND YELLOW JOURNALISM IN SMEARING 
STATES PERCEIVED AS PRO-IRAQI.  \"UKAZ\" WAS GENERALLY 
VIEWED AS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE AND SENSATIONALIST IN 
PRINTING SUCH STORIES, PARTICULARLY STORIES DIRECTED 
AGAINST YEMEN AND PRESIDENT SALEH OR THE OCCASIONAL 
\"INSPIRED LIE,\" SUCH AS A RECENT REPORT OF THE DEATH OF 
SADDAM.  LIKE PULITZER AND HEARST OF YORE, THIS POLICY 
PAID FINANCIAL DIVIDENDS AS \"UKAZ\" GRABBED MARKET SHARE 
AND INCREASED ITS CIRCULATION VIS-A-VIS OTHER SAUDI 
DAILIES. 
 
5.  \"AL-RIYADH\" (RIYADH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, ESTIMATED 
CIRCULATION: 100,000-120,000).  SISTER PAPER OF THE 
ENGLISH \"RIYADH DAILY.\"  FOUNDED IN 1964, \"AL-RIYADH\" AND 
\"AL-JAZIRA\" COMPETE FIERCELY FOR INFLUENCE IN NAJD AND 
EACH CLAIM TO BE A LARGER AND MORE INFLUENTIAL PAPER THAN 
THE OTHER.  (WE GIVE THE EDGE TO \"AL-RIYADH\" BY A SLIM 
MARGIN.)  COMPARATIVELY PROGRESSIVE FOR A SAUDI 
NEWSPAPER, \"AL-RIYADH\" WAS THE FIRST SAUDI NEWSPAPER TO 
OPEN A WOMEN\'S BUREAU.  ITS LITERARY PAGE IS DEEMED TO BE 
BY FAR THE BEST IN THE KINGDOM.  ITS EDITOR, TURKI 
AL-SUDAIRI, IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS ONE OF SAUDI 
ARABIA\'S BEST WRITERS AND ENJOYS A MEASURE OF 
ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT RESPECTABILITY HAVING ONCE BEEN BANNED 
FROM WRITING DUE TO A PARTICULARLY BITING DENUNCIATION HE 
WROTE OF THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION IN THE MID-EIGHTIES, 
THOUGH SUDAIRI IS FIRMLY IN THE CAMP OF GOVERNMENT 
LOYALISTS.  USIS RELATIONS WITH THIS PAPER, ALTHOUGH 
CORRECT, HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSE.  DESPITE OUR BEST 
EFFORTS, WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET \"AL-RIYADH\" AS 
INVOLVED IN USIS PROGRAMMING AS OTHER PAPERS. 
 
6.  \"AL-JAZIRA\" (RIYADH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, ESTIMATED 
CIRCULATION: 95,000-110,000).  FOUNDED IN 1963 AND SISTER 
PAPER OF \"AL-MASA\'IYA.\"  AS NOTED ABOVE, \"AL-JAZIRA\" AND 
\"AL-RIYADH\" COMPETE FIERCELY AGAINST EACH OTHER.  USIS 
RIYADH ENJOYS A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS PAPER THAN 
ANY OTHER.  (IN 1986, THE PAPER COYLY SUGGESTED THAT 
QADDAFI MAY HAVE GOTTEN WHAT WAS COMING TO HIM WHEN THE 
U.S. BOMBED LIBYA IN 1986 IN COMPARISON WITH THE 
UNIFORMLY NEGATIVE REACTIONS OF OTHER SAUDI PAPERS). 
MANAGING EDITOR, JASER AL-JASER, WRITES THE ONLY DAILY 
EDITORIAL DEVOTED TO POLITICAL COMMENTARY IN THE KINGDOM 
AND IS WIDELY FOLLOWED, ALTHOUGH, IN THE VOLUME OF HIS 
PRODUCTION, QUALITY SOMETIMES SUFFERS.  (AL-SUDAIRI AT 
\"AL-RIYADH,\" BY CONTRAST, PRODUCES ONLY A WEEKLY COLUMN). 
 
7.  \"AL-MADINA\" (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, MORE 
RELIGIOUS THAN OTHER SAUDI PAPERS, ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: 
75,000-80,000).  FOUNDED IN MADINA IN 1936, \"AL-MADINA\" 
IS SAUDI ARABIA\'S OLDEST PAPER.  IN THE EARLY 1980S, THE 
PAPER LED \"UKAZ\" IN CIRCULATION, BUT HAS BADLY STUMBLED 
IN RECENT YEARS ALLOWING \"UKAZ\" TO ESTABLISH A COMMANDING 
LEAD IN THE HIJAZI MEDIA MARKET.  THE PAPER IS THOUGHT TO 
BE IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE. 
 
8.  \"AL-YOM\" (DAMMAM-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, ESTIMATED 
CIRCULATION: 75,000-90,000).  THE PAPER ENJOYED A 
REPUTATION IN LATE 1970S AS A PAPER OF MILD NASSERIST 
SYMPATHIES LEADING TO A CRACKDOWN IN 1981-1982 WHICH 
RESULTED IN THE DISMISSALS OF SEVERAL JOURNALISTS, 
INCLUDING THE PAPER\'S CHIEF EDITOR.  UNDER NEW EDITORSHIP 
AND WITH NO POLITICAL AXES TO GRIND, \"AL-YOM\" MAKES NO 
PRETENSIONS TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A LOCAL PAPER 
CATERING TO EASTERN PROVINCE AUDIENCES, ALSO CIRCULATED 
IN BAHRAIN, QATAR, AND ABU DHABI.  IN THE EARLY 1980S, 
THE PAPER DREAMED OF ESTABLISHING AN ENGLISH EDITION, BUT 
THESE PLANS SEEM FIRMLY SHELVED. 
 
9.  \"AN-NADWA\"  (MAKKAH-BASED, RELIGIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE, 
ESTIMATED CIRCULATION OF 25,000-30,000).  \"AN-NADWA\'S\" 
SMALL CIRCULATION MASKS THE IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF 
THIS PAPER WHICH IS A REDOUBT OF RELIGIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE 
OPINION IN THE KINGDOM.  THE PAPER\'S EDITOR, YUSUF 
DAMANHOURY, IS ONE OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S MOST RESPECTED 
JOURNALISTS AND ENJOYS A REPUTATION AS AN EDITOR WILLING 
TO TAKE RISKS AND MAKE PRINCIPALLED STANDS.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
\"AL-NADWA\" WAS THE ONLY SAUDI PAPER WHICH CONDEMNED THE 
IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT BEFORE THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT 
ADOPTED AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE ISSUE.  THE PAPER 
ALSO USED TO BE KNOWN FOR ITS STRONG SUPPORT OF THE 
PALESTINIAN CAUSE, AN EDITORIAL LINE FREQUENTLY 
ATTRIBUTED TO A LARGE NUMBER OF PALESTINIAN STAFFERS AT 
THE PAPER.  RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE PAPER HAS SWITCHED 180 
DEGREES ON ITS SUPPORT FOR THE PLO AND HAS BEEN THE MOST 
OUTSPOKEN OF SAUDI PAPERS IN CRITICIZING ARAFAT\'S 
LEADERSHIP, INCLUDING CARRYING EDITORIALS CALLING ON 
ARAFAT TO STEP DOWN AND QUESTIONING WHETHER THE PLO IS 
INDEED THE \"SOLE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE\" OF THE 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  SEVERAL STAFFERS AT THE PAPER ARE 
ALSO EMPLOYED BY THE MUSLIM WORLD LEAGUE.  THE PAPER\'S 
LOCATION IN MAKKAH INHIBITS USIS CONTACTS WITH THE PAPER 
DUE TO THE INABILITY OF NON-MUSLIMS TO TRAVEL TO THE HOLY 
CITY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CONTACT WITH ITS CORRESPONDENTS IN 
RIYADH AND JEDDAH. 
 
10.  \"AL-BILAAD\"  (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, 
ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: 25,000-30,000).  FOUNDED IN 1959, 
IT IS GENERALLY AGREED TO BE ONE OF THE WEAKEST OF SAUDI 
ARABIA\'S DAILIES.  ITS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD IS AMIN 
ABDULLAH KARKORI, WHO, ALONG WITH A CADRE OF BUSINESSMEN 
AND LOCAL WRITERS, ARE THE MAINSTAYS OF THE PAPER\'S 
EDITORIAL STAFF.  THE PAPER EMPLOYS FEW REPORTERS AND 
RELIES HEAVILY ON WIRE SERVICES FOR ITS NEWS COVERAGE. 
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF ABDUL AZIZ NAHARI IS A UNIVERSITY 
LECTURER WITH M.A. AND PH.D. DEGREES FROM THE UNITED 
STATES.  THE PAPER IS PROBABLY NOT A MONEY-MAKER. 
 
11.  \"ARAB NEWS\"  (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, YET 
LIBERAL IN THE SAUDI CONTEXT, ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: 
75,000-80,000.  ALSO PUBLISHED IN CAIRO).  SISTER PAPER 
OF \"AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT\" AND FOUNDED IN 1975.  BY FAR, THE 
MOST PROFESSIONAL OF THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PAPERS IN SAUDI 
ARABIA.  ITS EDITOR, KHALID AL-MAENNA, IS WELL-KNOWN IN 
JEDDAH FOR HIS SENTIMENTS FAVORING GREATER POLITICAL 
PARTICIPATION IN SAUDI ARABIA AND, IN NOVEMBER 1990, 
OPENLY ADMITS TO HAVING TESTED THE ACCEPTED BOUNDARIES OF 
SAUDI PRESS CENSORSHIP BY CARRYING STORIES ON THE ROLE OF 
WOMEN IN SAUDI SOCIETY AND HIGHLIGHTING COVERAGE OF THE 
PROCLAIMED KUWAITI COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIZATION.  SAUDI 
AUTHORITIES WERE REPORTEDLY NOT AMUSED, TOLD AL-MAENNA TO 
STOP FLIRTING WITH THE REGULATIONS, AND AL-MAENNA HAS 
RELUCTANTLY COMPLIED.  THE PAPER HAS SEVERAL WESTERN 
REPORTERS ON ITS STAFF TO ENSURE THAT EDITORIAL COPY 
REFLECTS PREVAILING ENGLISH SPELLING AND GRAMMAR. 
 
12.  \"SAUDI GAZETTE\"  (JEDDAH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, 
ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: 25,000-35,000).  SISTER PAPER OF 
\"UKAZ.\" FOUNDED IN 1976, THE \"SAUDI GAZETTE,\" WAS PERHAPS 
THE MOST ANTI-U.S. OF SAUDI PAPERS PRIOR TO DESERT 
SHIELD/STORM AND OCCASSIONALLY IS STILL SNIDE ABOUT U.S. 
POLICIES IN THE REGION.  ITS FLAMBOYANT EDITOR IS RIDAH 
LARY, A SAUDI CITIZEN OF PERSIAN ORIGIN, NOTED FOR 
WRITING SOME OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S LONGEST EDITORIALS WHICH 
EVEN ARABS CONCEDE FREQUENTLY GO ON AND ON WITHOUT EVER 
COMING TO THE POINT.  THE \"SAUDI GAZETTE\'S\" CHIEF 
CARTOONIST, ABDEL RAHIM ALIREZA, HAS A THIRD GRADER\'S 
TALENT FOR ART AND HAS A PARTICULARLY STRONG ANTI-U.S. 
STREAK TO HIS CARTOONS WHOSE POINT IS FREQUENTLY 
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.  (ONCE IN THE MID-1980S, A PARTICULARLY 
PIQUED USIS PAO REFUSED TO INCLUDE \"SAUDI GAZETTE\" 
EDITORIALS IN HIS USIS MEDIA REACTIONS STATING THAT HE 
DID NOT BELIEVE THEY WERE REFLECTIVE OF MAINSTREAM PUBLIC 
OPINION IN SAUDI ARABIA.)  ALTHOUGH STILL SAUDI ARABIA\'S 
SECOND LARGEST ENGLISH PAPER, THE NEWSPAPER HAS SUFFERED 
QUALITATIVE DECLINES THROUGHOUT THE EIGHTIES AND 
REPORTEDLY SUFFERS FROM DECLINING READERSHIP.  AS KHALID 
AL-MAENNA, THE EDITOR OF THE COMPETING \"ARAB NEWS\" ONCE 
REMARKED, \"I HOPE RIDAH LARY STAYS EDITOR OF THE PAPER 
FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS.\" 
 
13.  \"RIYADH DAILY\" (RIYADH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, 
ESTIMATED CIRCULATION: 15,000-25,000).  THE PAPER CLAIMS 
ORIGINS IN THE MID-1970S WHEN IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A 
FEW XEROXED SHEETS STAPLED TOGETHER, BUT BECAME A SERIOUS 
NEWSPAPER IN 1985.  UNDER A NEW EDITOR, TALAAT WAFA (AN 
M.A. HOLDER FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY AND A PH.D. 
CANDIDATE AT CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY), THE PAPER HAS MADE 
MAJOR QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENTS AND IS QUICKLY CATCHING UP 
ON THE \"SAUDI GAZETTE\" IN TERMS OF CIRCULATION.  WAFA HAS 
INVESTED HEAVILY IN THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND USE OF 
COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE PAPER WHICH REPORTEDLY STILL 
MAKES PUBLICATION UNPROFITABLE, BUT THE PAPER\'S 
MANAGEMENT SEEMS COMMITTED TO STRIVING AGGRESSIVELY TO 
COMPETE IN THE CROWDED SAUDI MARKET FOR ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS. 
 
14.  \"AL-DHAHIRA\"  (LONDON-BASED, SISTER PUBLICATION OF 
\"AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT\", CIRCULATION IN THE LOW THOUSANDS). 
\"AL-DHAHIRA\" WAS BROUGHT OUT AS AN AFTERNOON PAPER BY THE 
SAUDI RESEARCH AND MARKETING COMPANY (PUBLISHERS OF 
\"AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT\" AND \"ARAB NEWS\") IN RESPONSE TO THE 
IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT AND THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR 
NEWS THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD.  THE PAPER DOES NOT HAVE 
EDITORIAL CONTENT AND LIMITS ITSELF TO PUBLISHING UP TO 
THE MINUTE WIRE SERVICE REPORTS ON REGIONAL 
DEVELOPMENTS.  THE FUTURE OF THE PUBLICATION IN THE WAKE 
OF THE GULF WAR IS UNCLEAR, BUT ITS CIRCULATION IS 
CERTAINLY SUPPORTED BY GOVERNMENT PURCHASES. 
 
15.  \"AL-MASA\'IYA\"  (RIYADH-BASED, PRO-GOVERNMENT, 
RELIGIOUSLY CONSERVATIVE, ESTIMATED CIRCULATION OF 
25,000-35,000).  SISTER PAPER OF \"AL-JAZIRA.\"  OPENED IN 
1982 AS SAUDI ARABIA\'S ONLY AFTERNOON NEWSPAPER.  IN 
1983, CAME UNDER HEAVY FIRE FROM RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT 
AFTER PUBLISHING ARTICLES WHICH RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES 
FELT MOCKED ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS VALUES.  TO AVOID CLOSURE, 
THE PAPER APPOINTED A NEW EDITOR FROM RIYADH\'S 
ULTRACONSERVATIVE IMAM MUHHAMAD UNIVERSITY WHO HAS SHOWN 
LITTLE DIRECTION IN LEADING THE PAPER ANYWHERE.  THE 
PAPER IS REPORTEDLY IN FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY IN LIGHT OF 
COMPETITION FROM \"AL-DHAHIRA\" FOR A DECLINING 
AFTERNOON/EVENING READERSHIP. 
 
16.  COMMENT.  FOR A COUNTRY WITH A TOTAL POPULATION OF 
ROUGHLY TWELVE MILLION (SEVEN OR EIGHT MILLION OF WHOM 
ARE SAUDIS, THE REMAINDER ARE EXPATRIATES RUNNING THE 
GAMUT FROM SOPHISTICATED WESTERN TECHNOCRATS TO 
IMPOVERISHED ASIAN SWEEPERS), SAUDI ARABIA HAS AN 
UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER OF DAILY NEWSPAPERS.  THESE DOZEN 
PAPERS PROVIDE A LARGE VOLUME OF EDITORIALS AND NEWS 
ANALYSES FOR USIS MEDIA REACTIONS, BUT RARELY IS THERE 
ANY PROVOCATIVE DEVIATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT\'S PERCEIVED 
VIEWS ON DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL ISSUES.  IN COMPARISON 
WITH OTHER MUSLIM COUNTRIES, THE SAUDI PRESS (BOTH IN THE 
ENGLISH, AND TO AN EVEN GREATER EXTENT, IN THE ARABIC 
PRESS) DEVOTES LARGE VOLUMES OF NEWSPRINT TO PROMOTING 
ISLAMIC PRACTICES AND PIETIES, AS A CONSTANT REINFORCER 
OF THE \"CORRECTNESS\" OF THE SAUDI VIEW OF ISLAM.  (SUCH 
WRITINGS PROBABLY ATTRACT MORE READERS TO THE 
CONSERVATIVE PRESS THAN ANY COVERAGE OF INTERNATIONAL 
EVENTS.)  WHILE THE NUMBER OF PAPERS AND JOURNALISTS 
CERTAINLY MERITS STRONG USIS ATTENTION, THE SAUDI PRESS 
ESTABLISHMENT, LIKE THE REST OF THE KINGDOM\'S MODERN 
INFRASTRUCTURE (SLEEK SUPERHIGHWAYS, L.A.-STYLE 
HIGHRISES, AND 21ST CENTURY AIRPORTS), HAS AN AIR OF 
GIANTISM AND UNREALITY ABOUT IT.  SUPERFICIALLY, THE 
SAUDI PRESS IS IMPRESSIVE AND GLITZY WITH ACCESS TO ALL 
OF THE WORLD\'S MEDIA SOURCES AND THE LATEST AND MOST 
TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, YET 
WITHIN IT THERE IS A CERTAIN HOLLOWNESS AS EGYPTIAN AND 
SUDANESE EXPATRIATES TOIL TO ASSEMBLE THIS NUMERICALLY 
LARGE, BUT UNPROVOCATIVE, ARRAY OF DAILY PRESS 
PUBLICATIONS. 
 
17.  MINIMIZES CONSIDERED.

IRAN FROM SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER PRINCE SAUD AL-FAISAL BY

WITH SAUDI ARABIA BY SETTING UP ITS OWN ISLAMIC 
ORGANIZATIONS.  THEY HAD FAILED IN THIS REGARD AND WERE 
NOW ATTEMPTING TO WORK THROUGH THE EXISTING MACHINERY 
INSTEAD.  HOWEVER, THEIR GOALS REMAINED THE SAME -- 
REGIONAL HEGEMONY AND INTERVENTION IN ARAB AFFAIRS. 
 
3.  TURNING TO GCC RELATIONS WITH IRAN, PRINCE SAUD SAID 
THAT OMAN WAS NO LONGER AS \"FASCINATED\" WITH IRAN AS IT 
HAD ONCE BEEN.  (LATER, THE PRINCE REMARKED THAT HE 
RECOGNIZED THE OMANIS HAD TO ADOPT A DIFFERENT POSTURE ON 
IRAN THAN SOME OTHER GCC STATES DUE TO THEIR CLOSE 
GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY TO IT.)  IN FACT, PRINCE SAUD 
CONTINUED, ALL GCC COUNTRIES DESIRED GOOD RELATIONS WITH 
IRAN, BUT IRANIAN POLICIES (ITS MILITARY BUILD-UP, 
AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE OF MILITARY EXERCISES, AND THE 
ANTI-PEACE CONFERENCE IN TEHRAN) REMINDED EVERYONE THAT 
THE ONLY REAL THREATS TO GULF SECURITY HAD COME FROM 
STATES WITHIN THE REGION. 
 
4.  PRINCE SAUD CONTINUED THAT THE ONLY AREA WHERE IRAN 
WAS BEING AT ALL REASONABLE WAS ON THE HOSTAGES IN 
LEBANON.  HOWEVER, EVEN HERE HE SAW AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE, 
SAYING THAT THE IRANIANS\' TRUE OBJECTIVE WAS TO GET THE 
WESTERN ECONOMIC BOYCOTT OF IRAN LIFTED.  THE IRANIANS 
NOW REALIZE, HE SAID, THAT THEY MUST STRENGTHEN THEIR 
ECONOMY IF THEY ARE TO ACHIEVE THEIR MILITARY AND 
POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. 
 
5.  PRINCE SAUD CONCLUDED HIS CRITIQUE OF IRAN BY NOTING 
THAT, FORTUNATELY, THE IRANIANS WERE NOT FOOLING ANY OF 
THE GCC COUNTRIES, ALL OF WHOM HE SAID REGARDED IRAN AS A 
THREAT NOT AN ALLY.  THERE WOULD OF COURSE BE SPORADIC 
ATTEMPTS TO SHOW GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS, SUCH AS THE RECENT 
VISIT BY QATAR\'S CROWN PRINCE, BUT MOST IRANIAN/GCC 
PROJECTS, SUCH AS THE SWEETWATER PIPELINE TO QATAR UNDER 
THE GULF, WOULD FALL OF THEIR OWN WEIGHT FOR ECONOMIC 
REASONS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER CONCLUDED. 
 
6.  COMMENT: PRINCE SAUD\'S CANDID REMARKS DEMONSTRATE 
CLEARLY THAT DESPITE THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS, THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND 
ITS MAIN COMPETITOR FOR INFLUENCE IN THE MUSLIM WORLD.

E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR 
TAGS: PINR, SOCI, PGOV, SA 
SUBJECT: MY BROTHER\'S A MUJAHID, CONFESSES A SAUDI BANKER 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY: AN OTHERWISE CALM SENIOR BANKER RECENTLY 
REVEALED TO US THAT HIS BROTHER HAD FOUGHT WITH THE 
MUJAHIDEEN IN AFGHANISTAN.  HIS ACCOUNT ILLUSTRATES THE 
DIFFERENT VIEWS OF ISLAM AND SOCIETY THAT EXIST IN 
SAUDI ARABIA, EVEN WITHIN FAMILIES - - DIFFERENCES THAT 
GO FAR BEYOND THE COMMONPLACE ISSUES OF THE ROLE OF THE 
MUTAWWA\'IN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. THE CHARGE RECENTLY TALKED TO A PROMINENT BANK 
PRESIDENT AND FORMER FINANCE MINISTRY OFFICIAL.  DURING 
THE DISCUSSION, THIS SOBER-MINDED PERSON REVEALED THAT 
HIS BROTHER FOUGHT WITH THE MUJAHIDEEN FOR FOUR MONTHS 
IN AFGHANISTAN IN 1991.  AS AN EXPLANATION, HE 
DESCRIBED HIS BROTHER AS A 19 YEAR OLD KID WHO HAD NOT 
FINISHED SCHOOL AND WHO WAS BORED WITH HIS EXISTENCE IN 
SAUDI ARABIA.  FOR HIM, FIGHTING FOR ISLAM IN 
AFGHANISTAN WAS AN EXCITING ALTERNATIVE, A WAY TO 
EXPRESS HIS DEEP PERSONAL RELIGIOUS FAITH. 
 
4. THE BANKER DID NOT VOLUNTEER ANY DETAILS OF HIS 
BROTHER\'S STAY IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT INSTEAD SKIPPED 
AHEAD TO THE POINT OF HIS RETURN.  WHEN THE BROTHER 
CAME BACK AFTER HIS JAUNT, THE FAMILY WAS WORRIED \"THAT 
HE MIGHT GET INTO TROUBLE.\"  SO, THE FAMILY QUICKLY 
ARRANGED A MARRIAGE - - \"TOOK CARE OF THAT RIGHT 
AWAY\".  GRATEFUL FOR SMALL FAVORS, THE BANKER WAS HAPPY 
TO REPORT THAT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER HAS NOT EXPRESSED 
ANY DESIRE TO GO FIGHT IN BOSNIA. 
 
5. SINCE HIS RETURN, AND CONTRARY TO THE FAMILY\'S 
EXPECTATION, THE BROTHER HAS DECLINED TO LIVE WITH HIS 
MOTHER, WHO LIVES ALONE IN RIYADH.  INSTEAD, HE DECIDED 
TO MOVE TO DAMMAM.  OUR CONTACT EXPRESSED THE FEAR THAT 
HIS BROTHER IS TRYING TO SEVER HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH 
THE REST OF THE FAMILY.  THE BANKER SAID HIS BROTHER, 
ALTHOUGH POLITE, AVOIDS TALKING TO HIM BECAUSE HE IS A 
BANKER, A VOCATION THAT THE BROTHER FINDS DISTASTEFUL. 
 
6. THE BANKER SAID THAT, DESPITE THE INFLUENCE OF 
RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES SUCH AS HIS BROTHER, SAUDI 
ARABIA IS A STABLE COUNTRY, IN LITTLE DANGER OF GOING 
THE WAY OF IRAN OR ALGERIA.  HE CONTINUED THAT, UNLIKE 
IN SUDAN AND IRAN, THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN SAUDI 
ARABIA DOES NOT SUPPORT THE EXTREMISTS.  HERE, PEOPLE 
RECOGNIZE THAT THE EXTREMISTS ARE ONLY GRABBING FOR 
POWER, NOT RELIGION.  THE BANKER SAID THAT EXTREMISTS 
WERE MORE LIKELY TO BRING ABOUT CHAOS THAN SUCCESS 
THROUGH THEIR ECONOMIC PROGRAMS, AS SHOWN IN SUDAN AND 
IRAN.  THERE, EXTREMISTS DID NOT FIX ECONOMIES - THEY 
RUINED THEM. 
 
7. IN SAUDI ARABIA, THE KING HOLDS ALL THE CARDS, AND 
IS ABLE TO TONE DOWN OR QUASH SUCH DISSENT AT ANY 
TIME.  THE BANKER SAID THAT THE KING DID PRECISELY THAT 
A FEW YEARS AGO, WITH RAPID SUCCESS.  THE DANGER, HE 
SAID, WAS NOT THAT EXTREMISTS WOULD TOPPLE THE SAG WITH 
FORCE.  RATHER THE DANGER IS THAT, BY FORCEFULLY 
CHALLENGING THE SAG, THE EXTREMISTS WILL RISK TEARING 
THE FABRIC OF SAUDI SOCIETY. 
 
8. THE BANKER DID CONCEDE THAT SOME BUSINESSMEN DO 
STAND OUT FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR ISLAMIC GROUPS, CITING 
THE EXAMPLE OF USAMA BIN LADEN.  ALTHOUGH MOST KNOWN 
FOR HIS FUNDING OF MUJAHIDEEN GROUPS IN AFGHANISTAN, 
BIN LADEN HAS GIVEN MONEY TO SEVERAL ISLAMIC CAUSES 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THE BANKER SAID BIN LADEN IS AN 
EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF MOST BUSINESSMEN 
IN SAUDI ARABIA.  MOST, HE REPEATED, DO NOT SUPPORT THE 
GOALS OF EXTREMISTS. 
 
9. COMMENT: THIS GENTLEMAN HAS OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THE 
DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF EXTREMISM IN SAUDI ARABIA SOME 
THOUGHT.  HAVING A TRUE BELIEVER WILLING TO FIGHT FOR 
ISLAM FOR A BROTHER HAS GIVEN HIM GOOD REASON.  OTHER 
SAUDI BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT FIGURES HAVE MADE SIMILAR 
COMMENTS ON EXTREMISTS AND THE STABILITY OF SAUDI 
ARABIA, AND WE ASSUME SOME FACE THE SAME FAMILIAL 
DIVIDE.  AT PRESENT, THEIR JUDGEMENTS THAT THE KINGDOM 
IS STABLE SEEM CORRECT, BUT THE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION 
IN THEIR OWN FAMILIES ILLUSTRATES THE DEPTH OF THE 
DISAGREEMENTS OVER THE PROPER ROLE OF ISLAM IN SAUDI 
SOCIETY. 
 
10. FOR MANY OF OUR BANKER FRIEND\'S GENERATION, IT IS 
NOT THE ISLAMIC CONTENT OF THE THOUGHT OF THEIR YOUNGER 
BROTHERS (AND SONS) THAT SCARES THEM.  SOCIALLY, THEY 
ARE, BY AND LARGE, A VERY CONSERVATIVE, DEVOUT LOT 
THEMSELVES.  RATHER, THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT HOW ENGAGED 
THE YOUNG ARE IN SAUDI ARABIA.  IT IS THE BOREDOM AND 
LACK OF DIRECTION THAT INSPIRED THE YOUNGER BROTHER TO 
FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN, AND IMPELS OTHERS DOMESTICALLY; 
THAT IN TURN CAUSES CONCERN AMONG THE OLDER GENERATION, 
WHO CHERISH THE STABILITY OF THE KINGDOM.  END 
COMMENT.

LARGE AND WEALTHY JEDDAH-BASED BUSINESS FAMILY, PUBLICLY 
SOUGHT TO DISTANCE HIMSELF AND HIS CLAN FROM THE FAMILY 
BLACK SHEEP AND INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC ACTIVIST, HIS 
BROTHER USAMA BIN LADIN.  IN THE ARTICLE, BIN LADIN 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE FAMILY HAD NO CONTROL OVER AND NO 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OF USAMA.  A SIMILAR

FOLLOWING TRANSLATION OF BAKR\'S STATEMENT. 
 
3.  BEGIN TRANSLATION 
 
ENGINEER BAKR BIN LADIN:  USAMA BIN LADIN IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR HIS STATEMENTS AND HIS BEHAVIOR WHICH WE NEITHER 
CONTROL NOR CONDONE. 
 
IN LIGHT OF NEWS ITEMS RECENTLY CARRIED IN THE PRESS 
CONCERNING USAMA MUHAMMAD BIN LADIN AND IN A DESIRE TO 
CLARIFY THE POSITION OF HIS FAMILY, ENGINEER BAKR 
MUHAMMAD BIN LADIN KABIR AL BIN LADIN ISSUED THE 
FOLLOWING STATEMENT. 
 
\"I AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY--WHO NUMBER MORE 
THAN FIFTY PEOPLE--EXPRESS OUR GREAT REGRET, SORROW, AND 
DISAPPROVAL OF ALL OF USAMA\'S BEHAVIOR, WHICH WE NEITHER 
CONTROL NOR CONDONE.  IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT USAMA 
HAS BEEN LIVING OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA NOW 
FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS AND ALL OF THE EFFORTS WE HAVE 
MADE TO BRING HIM BACK TO THE CORRECT PATH, WE CONSIDER 
HIM SINGULARLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS STATEMENTS, ACTIONS, 
AND BEHAVIOR, IF IN FACT HE DID THEM. 
 
END TRANSLATION 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4.  WE ARE AWARE OF NO RECENT STATEMENT OR ACTION BY 
USAMA THAT MIGHT HAVE TRIGGERED SUCH A REACTION.  THUS, 
IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THIS DISCLAIMER WAS PROMPTED BY 
THE PUBLIC ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE BIN LADEN FAMILY AS 
A RESULT OF PRESS REPORTS ABOUT THE RECENT ATTACK ON 
USAMA\'S RESIDENCE IN KHARTOUM. 
 
5.  THE FACT THAT BAKR\'S STATEMENT WAS CARRIED ON THE 
FRONT PAGE OF A MAJOR SAUDI PAPER SUGGESTS THAT IN 
ADDITION TO THE BIN LADIN FAMILY, THE ROYAL FAMILY ALSO 
ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO PUBLICLY SEPARATING USAMA 
FROM HIS ROOTS IN THE KINGDOM. 
 
6.  FOR JEDDAH AND KHARTOUM:  EMBASSY RIYADH WOULD 
APPRECIATE ADDITIONAL REPORTING THAT MIGHT HIGHLIGHT ANY 
RECENT STATEMENTS OR ACTIONS BY USAMA--PERHAPS SINCE THE 
ATTACK ON HIS RESIDENCE IN KHARTOUM--THAT MIGHT HAVE 
PRECIPITATED THE PUBLIC DISAVOWAL BY BAKR AND THE FAMILY. 
 
7.  KHARTOUM - MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  MAJLIS ASH-SHURA PRESIDENT MOHAMMED BIN 
JUBAIR REVIEWED IN GENERAL TERMS THE WORK OF THE MAJLIS 
ASH-SHURA, ASSERTING THAT IT WAS PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY AND 
SATISFACTORILY.  HE SAID, WITHOUT ELABORATION, THAT THE 
MAJLIS ASH-SHURA HAS NOT YET ESTABLISHED A VISITORS 
POLICY.  ON FOREIGN POLICY, BIN JUBAIR SAID THAT THE 
ATTAINMENT OF PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS PARAMOUNT, 
THAT HE SUPPORTED U.S. PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA (BUT 
WONDERED WHY THE U.S. DOES NOT APPLY EQUAL PRESSURE ON 
ISRAEL BECAUSE OF ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS), AND THAT HE 
APPROVED OF RECENT U.N. ACTIONS IN BOSNIA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  CHARGE APRIL 13 MET WITH MAJLIS ASH-SHURA 
(CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL) PRESIDENT MOHAMMAD BIN JUBAIR TO 
OFFER HIS PERSONAL CONGRATULATIONS ON THE INAUGURATION 
OF THE MAJLIS ASH-SHURA BY KING FAHD LAST DECEMBER 29 
(REF A) AND TO REVIEW WITH BIN JUBAIR THE ACTIVITIES OF 
THE BODY SINCE THEN. 
 
 
REVIEWS WORK OF COUNCIL:  NO PROBLEMS 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  BIN JUBAIR SAID THE WORK OF THE COUNCIL WAS GOING 
SMOOTHLY.  COMMITTEES, COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN AND COMMITTEE 
VICE-CHAIRMEN HAD BEEN NAMED AND EVERYONE WAS VERY BUSY 
AT WORK.  THE COUNCIL MEETS TWICE A MONTH (ON SUNDAYS) 
AND ITS COMMITTEES MEET ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK.  HE SAID 
THAT THE COUNCIL IS CURRENTLY FOCUSING ITS ATTENTION ON 
\"REGULATIONS\" AND \"INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.\" 
 
5.  REVIEWING PROCEDURE -- AND CONFIRMING INFORMATION 
GIVEN TO US IN DECEMBER BY MAJLIS ASH-SHURA VICE 
PRESIDENT ABDULLAH NASEEF (REF B) -- BIN JUBAIR SAID 
THAT AFTER A COMMITTEE HAS STUDIED AN ISSUE, IT SENDS A 
REPORT TO THE FULL COUNCIL.  IF THERE ARE OBJECTIONS IN 
THE COUNCIL, THE REPORT IS REVIEWED BY THE EXECUTIVE 
COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL (COMPRISED OF THE PRESIDENT, 
VICE-PRESIDENT AND COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN) WHICH DECIDES 
WHETHER THE REPORT IS TO BE SENT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR 
FURTHER WORK OR FORWARDED TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS 
FOR ACTION. 
 
6.  ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE MAJLIS ASH-SHURA AND THE 
REGIONAL COUNCILS, BIN JUBAIR SAID THAT THERE WAS AS YET 
NO WORKING RELATIONSHIP.  BUT HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT 
THE REGIONAL BODIES AND THE MAJLIS MIGHT IN FUTURE SHARE 
\"STUDIES AND OPINIONS ON CERTAIN TOPICS,\" PERHAPS 
THROUGH AN ANNUAL JOINT MEETING WHICH MIGHT \"OPEN A NEW 
ERA FOR CONSULTATION, DISCUSSIONS AND NEW IDEAS.\" 
 
7.  RESPONDING TO CHARGE\'S QUESTION AS TO HOW OTHER SAG 
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WERE REACTING TO THE MAJLIS 
ASH-SHURA, BIN JUBAIR SAID THAT THE MINISTRIES WERE 
GENERALLY PLEASED WITH THE FACT THAT THEY COULD REFER 
THEIR PROBLEMS/ISSUES TO THE MAJLIS WHERE SPECIALISTS 
COULD STUDY AND THEN RECOMMEND SOLUTIONS FOR THEM.  HE 
NOTED HERE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WERE THREE \"POWERS\" IN 
THE KINGDOM -- THE JUDICIAL, THE EXECUTIVE, AND THE 
ORGANIZATIONAL -- THE JUDICIAL (THE ISLAMIC LAW OF THE 
SHARIA)) WAS SUPREME, I.E. THAT THERE WAS NO SET OF 
CHECKS AND BALANCES AT WORK, BUT RATHER LAW DERIVED FROM 
THE QURAN WITH WHICH THE BEHAVIOR OF RULERS AND COUNCILS 
ALIKE MUST BE CONSISTENT. 
 
 
UNTIL PROCEDURES ARE ANNOUNCED:  NO VISITORS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  CHARGE ASKED WHETHER THE MAJLIS HAD DEVELOPED A 
VISITORS POLICY.  HE NOTED THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE 
INTEREST IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE MAJLIS ASH-SHURA IN 
THE U.S. -- THAT NEWS OF THE INAUGURATION OF THE MAJLIS 
IN DECEMBER HAD MADE THE EVEN LOCAL CALIFORNIA PAPERS 
WHERE CHARGE HAD BEEN ON LEAVE -- AND THAT FUTURE 
OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL VISITORS TO THE KINGDOM WOULD 
CERTAINLY BE SEEKING TO MEET WITH MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. 
 
9.  JUBAIR SAID THAT THERE WAS AS YET NO PROCEDURE 
WHEREBY FOREIGN ACADEMICS, DIPLOMATS OR HIGH-RANKING 
VISITORS COULD ARRANGE FOR VISITS WITH MEMBERS OF THE 
MAJLIS ASH-SHURA, BUT THAT HE EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD 
BE A WRITTEN POLICY IN THE FUTURE.  HE SAID THAT THOSE 
WISHING TO MEET WITH MAJLIS OFFICIALS NEEDED FOR THE 
TIME BEING TO SUBMIT FORMAL DIPLOMATIC REQUESTS TO THE 
FOREIGN MINISTRY WHICH WOULD THEN CONSULT WITH THE 
COUNCIL PRESIDENT (I.E. BIN JUBAIR). 
 
 
THE PEACE PROCESS: NUMBER ONE PRIORITY 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10.  INVITED TO COMMENT ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES, BIN 
JUBAIR SAID THAT PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS THE NUMBER 
ONE PRIORITY AND THAT SAUDI ARABIA \"HOPED, WANTED AND 
EXPECTED\" THAT U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE PEACE PROCESS 
WOULD BE \"FAIR.\"  HE FURTHER NOTED THAT HE AGREED WITH 
U.S. PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA TO LIMIT NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
PROLIFERATION, BUT WONDERED WHY THE U.S. WAS NOT 
PRESSURING ISRAEL AS WELL.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED HIS 
APPROVAL OF RECENT U.N. ACTIONS IN BOSNIA. 
 
11.  CHARGE SAID THAT THE U.S. IS WORKING HARD TO HELP 
ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE REGION AND THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT 
ONE COULD FIND A COUNTRY AS FAIR IN ITS EFFORTS.  CHARGE 
ALSO EXPLAINED THAT ISRAEL IS ONE OF THREE 
NON-SIGNATORIES OF THE NPT.  THE U.S. IS PRESSURING 
NORTH KOREA BECAUSE IT SIGNED THE NPT AND THEN LIED 
ABOUT THE NATURE OF ITS NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES.  CHARGE 
NOTED THAT UNIVERSALITY OF NPT ADHERENCE IS U.S. POLICY, 
A POSITION THAT IS WELL KNOWN TO ISRAEL.  FROM TIME TO 
TIME, WE REITERATE OUR VIEWS ON THIS TO ISRAEL. 
 
WHILE WAITING FOR RESULTS:  NO DISTRACTIONS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
13.  COMMENT:  BIN JUBAIR AND OTHER SAG OFFICIALS HAVE 
TAKEN PAINS TO EXPLAIN TO US THAT THEY VIEW THE MAJLIS 
ASH-SHURA AS A CONSULTATIVE, BUT NOT A DEMOCRATIC OR A 
LEISLATIVE BODY.  IT MAY BE THAT THE SAG HOPES THAT TE 
DELIBERATIONS OF THIS BODY, GUIDED BY THE SAUD 
LEADERSHIP, WILL INCREASE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE REGIME 
AS IT ENTERS A PERIOD OF TOUGH FINANCIAL TIMES REQUIRING 
TOUGH REFORMS.  THE SAG MAY HAVE DECIDED THAT AS THE 
MAJLIS ASH-SHURA FINDS ITS OWN WAY AND UNTIL IT HAS 
ESTABLISHED SOME RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT, THAT IT DOES 
NOT WANT ITS MEMBERS DISTRACTED BY THE QUERIES OF 
FOREIGN ACADEMICS, DIPLOMATS OR OFFICIALS PUSHING HIDDEN 
(DEMOCRATIC) AGENDAS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR 
OFFICIAL ACCESS TO THE MEMBERS OF THE MAJLIS (WE DO MEET 
MAJLIS MEMBERS UNOFFICIALLY FROM TIME TO TIME ALTHOUGH 
THEY APPEAR TO BE UNDER SOME SORT OF GAG RULE). 
 
14.  IN CHARGE\'S THIRD MEETING WITH HIM (OTHER MEETINGS 
OCCURRED IN JANUARY AND JULY OF LAST YEAR), BIN JUBAIR 
SEEMED RELAXED, CONFIDENT AND READY TO DISCUSS MAJLIS 
AFFAIRS, IF ON HIS OWN TERMS.  HE STRUCK US AS SOMEONE 
WHO BELIEVES IN THE CERTAIN RELIABILITY OF HIS ISLAMIC 
MORAL COMPASS AND WHO IS CONFIDENT THAT FOLLOWING IT 
WILL LEAD TO THE REQUIRED SOLUTIONS.  WITH THAT 
CONFIDENCE BIN JUBAIR SEEMS BENT ON MOVING AT HIS OWN 
DELIBERATE PACE ON WHAT HE SEES TO BE THE NECESSARY WORK 
OF THE MAJLIS ASH-SHURA IN THE FACE OF WHATEVER 
SKEPTICISM MAY EXIST INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM. 
END COMMENT.

TAGS:  PTER 
SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA: 1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 286744 
 
1.  (U)  SAG POLICY HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THE ISSUANCE 
OF THE LAST TERRORISM REPORT.  THE SAG IS PRIMARILY 
CONCERNED WITH PREVENTING TERRORIST INCIDENTS DURING THE 
HAJJ, AND IS ALSO ALERT TO POTENTIAL IRANIAN- AND 
IRAQI-SPONSORED TERRORISM. 
 
2.  (U)  THE SAG DID NOT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE 
EXTRADITION OF TWO ETHIOPIANS WHO HIJACKED A SAUDIA 
AIRLINE FLIGHT FROM JEDDAH TO ADDIS ABABA AND FORCED IT 
TO LAND IN NAIROBI ON MARCH 8.  THE SAG DID NOT 
EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF AN ETHIOPIAN WHO 
HIJACKED AN ETHIOPIAN AIRFLINES FLIGHT FROM JEDDAH AND 
FORCED IT TO LAND IN SANA\'A, YEMEN ON APRIL 25.  IT WAS 
REPORTED THAT IN BOTH INCIDENTS THE HIJACKERS WERE BEING 
DEPORTED AFTER ENTERING SAUDI ARABIA ILLEGALLY OR 
ILLEGALLY OVERSTAYING THEIR PILGRIMAGE VISAS, AND NOT 
POLITICAL TERRORISTS. 
 
3.  (C)  ALTHOUGH BOTH HIJACKINGS OCCURRED OUTSIDE SAUDI 
AIRSPACE, THESE TWO INCIDENTS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
ABILITY OF SAUDI AUTHORITIES TO DETECT AND RESPOND TO 
TERRORIST INCIDENTS.  SAUDI AIRPORT SECURITY WAS 
INADEQUATE TO DETECT THE HIJACKING THREAT.  SAUDI CIVIL 
AVIATION AND DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATIONS PROCEDURES WERE 
INADEQUATE IN RESPONDING TO THE INCIDENTS; THE SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT WAS INFORMED THAT THE MARCH 8 INCIDENT WAS IN 
PROGRESS BY U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS.  AIRLINE SECURITY 
HAS INCREASED SINCE THE INCIDENT, AND POLICIES AND 
PROCEDURES TO HANDLE TERRORIST INCIDENTS ALREADY EXIST. 
HOWEVER, THE RELEVANT SAUDI MINISTRIES AND AGENCIES DID 
NOT FOLLOW THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN EITHER CASE, 
WHICH RAISES QUESTIONS WHETHER SAUDI FORCES WILL PERFORM 
BETTER IN FUTURE HIJACKINGS. 
 
4.   (C)  REPORTS OF \"FRIENDLY-FIRE\" INJURIES AND 
CASUALTIES BY THE SAUDI ANTI-TERRORIST POLICE SQUAD 
DURING A RECENT NON-TERRORIST HOSTAGE-TAKING RAISE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SAUDI ABILITY TO RESPOND 
APPROPRIATELY TO FUTURE TERRORIST HOSTAGE INCIDENTS (SEE 
SEPTEL). 
 
5.  (U)  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT REVOKED THE CITIZENSHIP OF 
OSAMA BIN LADIN, A SAUDI KNOWN TO SUPPORT EXTREMIST 
GROUPS AND SUSPECTED OF FINANCING TERRORISM IN YEMEN, 
SUDAN, AFGHANISTAN, EGYPT, LEBANON, AND THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES.  MINISTRY OF INTERIOR OFFICIALS SAID THAT 
BIN LADEN\'S CITIZENSHIP WAS REVOKED BECAUSE HE HAD 
FAILED TO FOLLOW GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVES TO RETURN TO 
SAUDI ARABIA TO ANSWER CHARGES AND BECAUSE OF HIS 
\"IRRESPONSIBLE ACTIVITIES WHICH CONTRADICTED THE 
KINGDOM\'S INTERESTS AND HARMED ITS RELATIONS WITH 
SISTERLY COUNTRIES.\"  BIN LADEN IS BANNED FROM 
RE-ENTERING THE KINGDOM. 
 
6.  (U)  THERE WERE SEVERAL REPORTS THAT THE SAG IS OR 
HAS BEEN FUNDING TERRORIST GROUPS IN EGYPT, ALGERIA AND 
ISRAEL.  THERE WERE ALSO REPORTS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL 
ISLAMIC RELIEF ORGANIZATION, A SAUDI-GOVERNMENT- 
SPONSORED ORGANIZATION, WAS FINANCING EXTREMIST MUSLIM 
SECESSIONIST GROUPS IN THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES.  POST 
HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM ANY LINKS BETWEEN THE SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT AND TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
7.  (U)  SAUDI AUTHORITIES HAVE REPEATEDLY STATED THAT 
THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT FUND TERRORIST GROUPS, AND 
THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE 
VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS MUST OBTAIN FORMAL GOVERNMENT 
AUTHORIZATION TO COLLECT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR 
INTERNATIONAL CAUSES.  ON OCTOBER 26, THE SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING TERRORISM, 
ESPECIALLY TERRORIST OPERATIONS THAT HINDER THE MIDDLE 
EAST PEACE PROCESS AND TRY TO DISTURB THE SECURITY OF 
THE REGION.

2.  SUMMARY.  IN A JANUARY 26 MEETING, SAUDI FOREIGN 
MINISTER SAUD AL-FAISAL TOLD NEA ASSISTANT SECRETARY 
PELLETREAU THAT IRAN HAD BEEN PRESSURING THE SAG FOR AN 
IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS, BUT THE SAG HAD SEEN NO 
INDICATION THAT IMPROVING RELATIONS WOULD PRODUCE A 
STABILIZING SITUATION.  HE SAID THE SAG WAS CONCERNED 
ABOUT IRANIAN MEDDLING IN BAHRAIN.  PELLETREAU SAID THE 
U.S. WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IRAN\'S SUPPORT OF SUBVERSIVE 
ACTIVITIES AND ITS RECENT PURCHASE OF A RUSSIAN NUCLEAR 
REACTOR.  HE SAID U.S. EFFORTS TO DENY IRAN NEW CREDIT 
WERE HAVING SOME EFFECT.  SAUD SAID THAT HE HAD RECENTLY 
HEARD THAT THERE WERE DIVISIONS WITHIN HIZBALLAH, AND 
SUGGESTED THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAVE AN 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE ON THIS SUBJECT.  PELLETREAU 
AGREED.  (OTHER SUBJECTS SEPTELS.)  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 26, ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY PELLETREAU AND FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD MET AT 
SAUD\'S HOME TO CONTINUE THEIR JANUARY 25 MEETING. 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER AL-KURDI SAT IN ON THE SAUDI 
SIDE AS NOTETAKER.  AMBASSADOR AND ACTING POLCOUNS 
(NOTETAKER) ACCOMPANIED PELLETREAU. 
 
4.  SAUD RAISED THE ISSUE OF IRAN BY SAYING THAT THE 
IRANIANS WERE CONSTANTLY CONTACTING THE SAG OUTSIDE 
DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS AND THROUGH THIRD PARTIES RELAYING 
THE MESSAGE THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT 
UNDERSTAND WHY THERE HAS BEN NO IMPROVEMENT IN 
SAUDI-IRANIAN RELATIONS, ESECIALLY SINCE THE IRANIAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER HAS VSITED SAUDI ARABIA TWICE.  SAUD 
SAID THAT THE SAG HAS SEEN NO CHANGE IN IRANIAN POLICY 
THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT AN IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS 
WOULD PRODUCE A STABILIZING SITUATION.  ALSO, THERE WERE 
UNRESOLVED REGIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS THE \"THREE ISLANDS\" 
DISPUTE WITH THE UAE AND IRANIAN MEDDLING IN BAHRAIN. 
 
IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT IN BAHRAIN 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  PELLETREAU ASKED SAUD HOW SERIOUS HE THOUGHT THE 
SITUATION IN BAHRAIN WAS.  SAUD SAID, \"VERY SERIOUS.\" 
THE SHIA IN BAHRAIN LOOK TO QOM FOR RELIGIOUS 
LEADERSHIP, AND SINCE THE TIME OF THE SHAH, IRAN HAS 
MADE TROUBLE FOR BAHRAIN.  HE SAID THAT IRAN DENIES IT 
IS INVOLVED IN BAHRAIN.  IT HAS SENT MESSAGES TO THE 
SAUDIS AND BAHRAINIS THROUGH THIRD PARTIES THAT IT WOULD 
\"DO ANYTHING\" TO PROVE THAT IT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN 
BAHRAIN.  SAUD SAID BAHRAIN WAS IN CONTACT WITH IRAN. 
 
6.  SAUD SAID THE BAHRAINI DISSIDENTS WERE MAKING 
EXTENSIVE USE OF THE MEDIA.  INTERNATIONAL MEDIA 
BROADCASTS INTO BAHRAIN TREAT THE DISTURBANCES AS IF 
THEY WERE THE ONLY EVENTS GOING ON IN THE WORLD.  SUCH 
MEDIA SCRUTINY WAS BAD FOR BAHRAIN\'S ECONOMY, WHICH 
DEPENDS ON TOURISM AND BUSINESS.  THE ANSWER DID NOT LIE 
IN DESTROYING THE COUNTRY.  HE HOPED WE WOULD BE 
UNDERSTANDING OF BAHRAIN\'S SITUATION. 
 
7.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WE HAD TOLD THE BAHRAINIS THAT 
WE THOUGHT THEY WERE HANDLING THE SITUATION WITH 
RESTRAINT.  THEY WERE A COUNTRY FRIENDLY TO THE U.S. AND 
THE KINGDOM AND REQUIRED SUPPORT.  SAUD SAID, \"BAHRAIN 
NEEDS HELP NOW.\"  HE SAID IRAN NEEDS TO BE SENT A 
MESSAGE THAT IT SHOULD NOT MEDDLE IN BAHRAIN\'S INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS. 
 
OTHER IRANIAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES 
----------------------------------- 
 
8.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT IRAN WAS DOING A NUMBER OF 
THINGS IT SHOULD NOT BE DOING.  IT WAS TRYING TO ACQUIRE 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  IT HAD CLOSE RELATIONS 
WITH SUDAN.  IT WAS CARRYING OUT WIDER SUBVERSIVE 
ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS CONDUCTING ACTIONS AGAINST EGYPT AND 
SUPPORTING HIZBALLAH AND ITS TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. 
 
9.  SAUD SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT THERE MAY BE 
DIVISIONS WITHIN HIZBALLAH.  THERE ARE THOSE WHO WANT A 
CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN, AND OTHERS WHO WANT 
HIZBALLAH TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT.  HE SAID THAT AN 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE ON THIS SUBJECT WOULD BE USEFUL, 
AND THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES SHOULD GET IN TOUCH 
WITH EACH OTHER.  PELLETREAU AGREED. 
 
IRANIAN/RUSSIAN RELATIONS 
------------------------- 
 
10.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT THE U.S. HAS BEEN IN CONTACT 
WITH RUSSIA ABOUT ITS RELATIONS WITH IRAN, AND HAD 
OBTAINED A RUSSIAN COMMITMENT NOT TO ENTER INTO ANY NEW 
MILITARY CONTRACTS WITH IRAN.  HOWEVER, WE DO NOT KNOW 
ALL THE DETAILS OF RUSSIA\'S CURRENT CONTRACTS.  SAUD 
SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT THE CONTRACTS WERE WORTH USD 
4 BILLION.  HE LAUGHED AND SAID THAT RUSSIAN EQUIPMENT 
WAS CHEAPER THAN U.S. EQUIPMENT.  THUS, USD 4 BILLION 
OUGHT TO BUY QUITE A BIT.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT EVEN 
THAT LARGE AMOUNT OF EQUIPMENT WON\'T COME CLOSE TO WHAT 
IRAN THINKS IT NEEDS. 
 
11.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WE HAD ALSO TALKED TO RUSSIA 
ABOUT ITS CONTRACT TO BUILD A NUCLEAR REACTOR AS 
BUSHEIR.  EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD COME UNDER IAEA 
SAFEGUARDS, IT WOULD GIVE IRAN TECHNOLOGY IT COULD USE 
FOR NON-PEACEFUL PURPOSES.  SAUD SAID THAT HE HAD 
UNDERSTOOD THAT IRAN\'S OTHER REACTORS WERE UNDER IAEA 
SAFEGUARDS.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WAS TRUE, BUT WE KNEW 
THAT THERE WAS MORE TO IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM THAN WHAT 
THE IAEA INSPECTORS SAW. 
 
12.  SAUD SAID THAT THE RUSSIANS DID NOT GIVE THE SAG 
UNCONDITIONAL ASSURANCES WHEN IT RAISED RUSSIA\'S SALES 
TO IRAN.  THE RUSSIANS SAID THAT FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES 
THEY HAD TO MAKE SALES.  HOWEVER, SAUDI ARABIA IS NOT 
GOING TO BUY RUSSIAN GOODS. 
 
RESTRICTING NEW CREDIT 
---------------------- 
 
13.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WE HAVE HAD LIMITED SUCCESS IN 
OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE G-7 COUNTRIES ABOUT NOT 
PROVIDING NEW CREDITS TO IRAN.  GERMANY HAD NOT PROVIDED 
NEW CREDITS, BUT HAD PAID THE GERMAN COMPANIES TO WHOM 
IRAN OWED MONEY, AND THEN RENEGOTIATED IRAN\'S PAYMENT 
TERMS.  IRAN HAD BET THAT OIL PRICES WOULD REMAIN HIGH. 
NOW, IT WAS HAVING PROBLEMS.  AS A RESULT, OUR POLICY OF 
RESTRICTING CREDIT TO IRAN WAS CAUSING IT TO CUT BACK ON 
ITS MILITARY PROCUREMENT. 
 
EU\'S \"CRITICAL DIALOGUE\" 
------------------------ 
 
14.  PELLETREAU SAID THAT WE HAVE ASKED THE EU WHAT 
RESULTS IT HAS TO SHOW FOR ITS \"CRITICAL DIALOGUE\" WITH 
IRAN.  THE EUROPEANS TELL US THEY ARE STRENGTHENING THE 
MODERATES.  HOWEVER, THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY 
MODERATES WHEN IT COMES TO IRAN\'S EXTERNAL POLICY.  SAUD 
AGREED AND SAID THAT EVEN IRAN\'S INTERNAL POLICIES ARE 
RESTRICTIVE, INCLUDING AREAS SUCH AS ITS BANKING SYSTEM.

SUBJECT:  FM SAUD AL-FAISAL: RELATIONS WITH JORDAN 
\"MOVING ALONG\" 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  IN JULY 4 MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR, FOREIGN MINISTER 
SAUD AL-FAISAL CHARACTERIZED SAUDI-JORDANIAN RELATIONS 
AS HAVING IMPROVED SOMEWHAT, \"THEY ARE MOVING ALONG,\" 
AND \"I THINK WE\'LL SEE MORE.\"  HE CONFIRMED THAT THE 
SAUDIS INTEND TO SEND AN AMBASSADOR TO AMMAN, \"PERHAPS 
NEXT MONTH,\" AND \"IN THE MEANTIME, WE WILL HAVE A 
VISITOR FROM JORDAN, PERHAPS THE FOREIGN MINISTER.\" 
 
3.  IN THE SAME BREATH, SAUD CAUTIONED THAT THE TWO 
SIDES NEED TO \"REVIEW WHAT HAPPENED, AND EXAMINE THE 
DAMAGE TO RELATIONS, SO AS TO AVOID A REPETITION IN THE 
FUTURE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST.\"  SAUD EXPRESSED 
HOPE THAT SUCH A REVIEW WOULD PRODUCE A POSITIVE 
ASSESSMENT, AND HE ADDED, \"WE HOPE JORDAN WILL CHANGE 
ITS POLICY IN THE REGION.\"  THERE IS NO PROBLEM BETWEEN 
SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN ON THE PEACE PROCESS, WHICH BOTH 
SUPPORT, BUT \"THE ONE PROBLEM\" IS HOW THE JORDANIANS ARE 
PURSUING THE ISSUE OF IRAQ. 
 
4.  SAUD PROFESSED NOT TO UNDERSTAND WHY KING HUSSEIN 
HAS TO TAKE POSITIONS SUPPORTIVE OF IRAQ IN HIS FIRST 
MEETINGS IN FRANCE.  WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS OF WHAT 
KING HUSSEIN TOLD THE FRENCH, HE SAID THAT THERE ARE 
WAYS AND WAYS TO DEAL WITH ISSUES.  SAUD ASKED 
RHETORICALLY WHETHER THE INTERESTS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE 
COULD BE SECURED BY GIVING SUPPORT TO THE IRAQI REGIME. 
CONCLUDING, HE STATED THAT IT WOULD BE JUSTIFIABLE IF 
JORDAN WANTED TO ACCUSE THE IRAQI REGIME AND THEN TRY TO 
HELP THE IRAQI PEOPLE THROUGH HUMANITARIAN CHANNELS 
ALLOWED BY THE SANCTIONS REGIME. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  IT APPEARS THAT SAUDI RELATIONS WITH 
JORDAN AT LAST ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION.  SAUD\'S BLUNT CONCERNS ABOUT PERCEIVED 
JORDANIAN SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT INDICATE, 
HOWEVER,  THAT A GOOD DEAL OF WORK REMAINS BEFORE A NEW 
CHAPTER CAN BE WRITTEN.

SUBJECT:  SAUDI CLERICS URGE OBEDIENCE TO KING, TAKE 
          SWIPE AT ISLAMIC OPPOSITION 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY: RIYADH\'S LEADING IMAM, TOGETHER WITH A 
SHAYKH FORMERLY RENOWNED FOR PUBLICLY OPPOSING AL SAUD 
POLICIES, RECENTLY ADVOCATED OBEDIENCE TO KING FAHD AND 
UNITY WITHIN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY.   THE OCCASION, A 
MOSQUE SEMINAR WHICH WAS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY COVERED BY 
A SAUDI NEWSPAPER, MARKED BOTH THE RETURN OF A RADICAL 
SHAYKH TO THE AL SAUD FOLD AND THE SAG RELIGIOUS 
ESTABLISHMENT\'S SUPPORT FOR STRICT MEASURES TAKEN 
AGAINST ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO UNDERMINE THE AL SAUD.  THE 
SEMINAR COMES IN THE WAKE OF SIGNIFICANT DOMESTIC AND 
INTERNATIONAL PRESS COVERAGE OF THE EXECUTION OF A CDLR 
SUPPORTER ON THE CHARGE OF ATTEMPTING TO DIVIDE THE 
MUSLIM COMMUNITY (UMMAH).  END SUMMARY 
 
 
ISLAMIC SEMINAR PROCEEDINGS AKIN TO FATWA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  IN THE MOST RECENT EPISODE OF JOCKEYING BETWEEN 
THE SAUDI RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT AND ISLAMIST CRITICS 
OF THE REGIME WHICH BEGAN IN THE WAKE OF THE GULF WAR, 
THREE SHAYKHS PROMINENT WITHIN THE OFFICIAL SAUDI 
RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT BANDED TOGETHER IN A PUBLIC 
APPEAL FOR OBEDIENCE TO KING FAHD AND UNITY WITHIN THE 
SUNNI COMMUNITY.  THE TRIO\'S MOST VOCAL SPOKESMAN IS A 
CLERIC ONCE NOTORIOUS FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE 1991 - 
92 \"MEMORANDUM OF ADVICE\" AND \"PEACE PROCESS\" PETITIONS 
- WHICH URGED THE KING TO JETTISON THE SAG-U.S. 
RELATIONSHIP AND CHART A MORE AUTHENTICALLY ISLAMIC 
COURSE - AND FOR HIS FLIRTATION WITH THE LONDON-BASED 
COMMITTEE FOR THE DEFENSE OF LEGITIMATE RIGHTS (CDLR). 
THE FORUM FOR THIS APPEAL, WHICH ATTRACTED COVERAGE IN 
THE SEPTEMBER 2 ISSUE OF THE ARABIC-LANGUAGE SAUDI 
NEWSPAPER \"OKAZ,\" WAS A SEMINAR CONDUCTED AT RIYADH\'S 
\"GRAND MOSQUE\" - THE LARGEST IN THE CAPITAL - HEADED BY 
THE PATRIARCH OF THE AL-SHAYKH FAMILY, WHOSE MEMBERS 
COMPRISE THE DESCENDANTS OF MUHAMMAD ABD AL-WAHHAB AND 
CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE RELIGIOUS PILLAR OF THE SAUDI 
STATE. 
 
3.  (C) SEMINARS ARE ROUTINELY CONDUCTED IN THE MAJOR 
MOSQUES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND THEIR THEMES, ACCORDING TO A 
LOCAL EMBASSY EMPLOYEE WHO FORMERLY TAUGHT AT THE IMAM 
MUHAMMAD BIN SAUD RELIGIOUS UNIVERSITY, CAN BE A 
FUNCTION OF A GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVE, A QUESTION FROM A 
WORSHIPPER, OR A DECISION OF THE SENIOR IMAM.  HOWEVER, 
THE FACT OF A SEMINAR AND A REPORT OF ITS CONTENTS IS 
RARELY PUBLICIZED.  THE COMBINATION OF THE PROMINENCE OF 
THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED AND THE PRESS PLAY GAVE THE 
SEMINAR\'S CONCLUSIONS THE FLAVOR, IF NOT THE LEGAL 
STATUS, OF A FATWA, ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE. 
 
RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT REPRESENTED 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  THE COMPOSITION OF THE SEMINAR\'S INSTRUCTORS 
WAS ARRESTING AS IT INCLUDED MAINLINE ESTABLISHMENT 
FIGURES TOGETHER WITH A SHAYKH WHO, IN THE RECENT PAST, 
CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THE REGIME FOR OPENLY 
CRITICIZING AL SAUD POLICIES.  THE FOLLOWING ARE BRIEF 
BIOS: 
 
-- SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ BIN ABDULLAH AL AL-SHAYKH: THE 
BLIND, ELDER STATESMAN OF THE AL AL-SHAYKH FAMILY, HE 
SITS ON THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF ULAMA AND IS THE IMAM OF 
THE RIYADH GRAND MOSQUE - THE VENUE OF THE SEMINAR. 
SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ IS A STALWART SUPPORTER OF THE AL 
SAUD, WHO ABSTAINED FROM ALL OF THE PETITION DRIVES OF 
1991-92. 

-- SHAYKH ABDULLAH BIN ABD AL-RAHMAN AL-JABRIYN: A 
SIGNATOR TO BOTH THE \"MEMORANDUM OF ADVICE\" AND THE 
\"PEACE PROCESS\" PETITIONS, AL-JABRIYN\'S EARLY SUPPORT 
FOR THE CDLR RESULTED IN HIS OUSTER FROM THE SUPREME 
COUNCIL OF ULAMA.  HOWEVER, FOLLOWING HIS HASTY 
RENUNCIATION OF THE CDLR UNDER OFFICIAL PRESSURE, SHAYKH 
AL-JABRIYN RETAINED HIS POSITION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT 
COMMITTEE FOR FATWAS AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.  IN A 
RECENT ISSUE OF THE SAUDI WEEKLY PUBLICATION 
\"AL-MUSLIMUUN,\" AL-JABRIYN AUTHORED THE \"FATWA\" PAGE, 
DISPENSING ISLAMIC GUIDANCE IN RESPONSE TO READERS 
LETTERS - A SPOT USUALLY RESERVED FOR FULL-FLEDGED 
MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF ULAMA. 
 
-- SHAYKH SALIH BIN ABD AL-AZIZ AL AL-SHAYKH:  OUR 
PRESUMPTION IS THAT SHAYKH SALIH, WHO IS A LECTURER ON 
THE KORAN AT IMAM MUHAMMAD UNIVERSITY, IS THE SON OF 
RIYADH GRAND MOSQUE IMAM SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ (ABOVE). 
 
 
OBEY KING FAHD 
-------------- 
 
5.  (C)  THE SHAYKHS DREW TWO CONCLUSIONS: (1) ANY 
DIVISIONS WITHIN THE SUNNI COMMUNITY WAS TO THE 
DETRIMENT OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY (\"JAMAA\'AT 
AL-MUSLIMIIN\"), OR MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS; AND (2) ALL 
\"PEOPLE OF THE MAJORITY\" SHOULD FOLLOW THE LEADER (IMAM) 
OF THE MUSLIMS.  IN THE SAUDI CONTEXT, THE PHRASE 
\"LEADER OF THE MUSLIMS\" REFERS UNAMBIGUOUSLY TO KING 
FAHD.  (IN FACT, IN MOSQUE SERMONS, A STANDARD FORMULA 
FOR REFERRING TO SAUDI ARABIA\'S TWO SENIOR-MOST LEADERS 
IS \"THE LEADER OF THE MUSLIMS AND THE CROWN PRINCE...\") 
 
6.  (C)  AL-JABRIYN\'S CONDEMNATION OF ISLAMIC FACTIONS 
(OR SCHISMS) SUCH AS THE JAMAA\'AT AL-SUNNA, ANSAR 
AL-SUNNA, AHL AL-TAWHID, AND JAMAA\'AT AL-TABLIGH SPARKED 
DIPLOMATIC SPECULATION THAT HERETOFORE UNKNOWN ISLAMIC 
POLITICAL OPPOSITION GROUPS HAD EMERGED IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
HOWEVER, STUDENTS OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT HAVE CLARIFIED THAT 
THE ABOVE-NAMED GROUPS REPRESENT SCHOOLS OF ISLAMIC 
THEOLOGY MAINLY ACTIVE OUTSIDE SAUDI ARABIA.  THEY 
CONSTITUTE STRANDS WITHIN THE BROADER SALIFIYYAH 
MOVEMENT OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN USING ORIGINAL TEXTS 
ONLY (THE KORAN AND THE SUNNA) IN INTERPRETING ISLAM. 
THESE GROUPS ARE INACTIVE IN SAUDI ARABIA (THOUGH 
DOUBTLESS ATTRACTING SOME SAUDI SYMPATHIZERS).  BUT 
LOCAL OBSERVERS READ INTO AL-JABRIYN\'S COMMENTS THE 
CONDEMNATION OF ANY OPPOSITION FORCE WHICH, WEARING THE 
CLOAK OF ISLAMIC VIGILANCE, SEEKS TO DIVIDE THE MUSLIM 
COMMUNITY. 
 
7.  (C)  THE SHAYKHS\' PAEAN TO THE IMAM, I.E., KING 
FAHD, WAS REMARKABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF SHAYKH 
AL-JABRIYN\'S PARTICIPATION.  THE SHAYKHS LECTURED THAT 
ONLY IN THE INSTANCE OF A KING\'S EMBRACE OF ATHEISM WAS 
IT APPROPRIATE FOR MUSLIMS TO TURN ON THE LEADER OF 
THEIR COMMUNITY.  THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THE 
\"MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS,\" THEY ADDED, WAS THEIR OBEDIENCE 
AND PATIENCE.  ONE OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF DIVISIVENESS 
IS DISOBEDIENCE TO THE KING WHICH CAN RESULT IN GREAT 
DAMAGE AND INTERNAL CRISIS WITHIN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. 
 

COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (C)  WE BELIEVE THE PRESS COVERAGE OF THE RIYADH 
GRAND MOSQUE SEMINAR SERVED TWO PURPOSES:  IT 
HIGHLIGHTED SHAYKH AL-JABRIYN\'S RETURN TO THE FOLD, AND 
IT UNDERLINED THE SAUDI RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT\'S 
SUPPORT FOR STRONG MEASURES AGAINST ANY INDIVIDUAL, 
SECULAR OR ISLAMIST, ATTEMPTING TO UNDERMINE THE 
LEGITIMACY OF THE SAUDI STATE.  THE LECTURE COMES IN THE 
WAKE OF A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLICITY, LOCAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL, PAID TO THE EXECUTION OF ABDULLAH 
AL-HIDAIF, A SUPPORTER OF THE CDLR WHO, THOUGH CONVICTED 
FOR MAIMING A POLICEMAN, WAS EXECUTED ON AUGUST 11 FOR 
THE CRIME OF ATTEMPTING TO DIVIDE THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. 
 
9.  (C)  THE SEMINAR ALSO REFLECTS AN EFFORT TO MEET 
ISLAMIST CRITICS ON THEIR OWN THEOLOGICAL GROUNDS IN A 
SOCIETY IN WHICH POLITICS OFTEN TAKES ON THE COLORATION 
OF THEOLOGICAL DEBATE.  WHILE HARD-CORE CRITICS MAY 
REMAIN UNPERSUADED, THE SEMINAR\'S ORGANIZERS MAY HOPE 
THAT RESTORING THE PATINA OF RELIGIOUS LEGITIMACY ON 
RULE BY THE AL SAUD WILL INFLUENCE LESS COMMITTED 
SKEPTICS AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE.   END COMMENT

REF:  (A) RIYADH 5218; (B) RIYADH 5219 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  CLASSIFIED BY DCM 
THEODORE KATTOUF - 1.5 B,D. 
 
2.  (C) THE CURRENT MEDICAL PROGNOSIS FOR KING FAHD, 
ALBEIT INCOMPLETE AND TENTATIVE, SUGGESTS THE 
POSSIBILITY OF MEDIUM-TERM OR EVEN PROLONGED RECOVERY 
FROM WHAT IS DESCRIBED DEFINITIVELY BY OUR MEDICAL 
SOURCES AS A STROKE.  AT THIS STAGE, WITHIN HOURS OF 
FAHD ENTERING THE HOSPITAL, THE KING\'S CONDITION DOES 
NOT REPEAT NOT APPEAR IMMEDIATELY LIFE-THREATENING 
(ALTHOUGH IT COULD LATER MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION). 
INDEED, OUR RMO ALSO NOTES THAT RAPID AND FULL RECOVERY, 
EVEN WITHIN A DAY OR TWO, IS ALSO ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. THE 
KING\'S PERSONAL SECRETARY STRONGLY IMPLIED IN A CALL TO 
THE AMBASSADOR THAT SUCH AN UPBEAT PROGNOSIS IS 
WARRANTED (SEE REF B). 
 
3.  (C) ASSUMING, HOWEVER, THAT SOME DEGREE OF 
INCAPACITATION PERSISTS, PERHAPS OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS, 
THE ISSUE OF ITS IMPACT ON DECISION-MAKING AND ON 
INTERNAL DYNAMICS WITHIN THE AL SAUD MUST BE FACED. 
 
4.  (C) ASSUMING THAT FAHD DOES NOT SHOW IMMEDIATE SIGNS 
OF FULL RECOVERY WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS, THE 
COUNCIL OF ELDERS, CONSISTING OF THE MEMBERS OF THE AL 
SAUD AND MOSTLY OF THE SENIOR SURVIVING SONS OF ABDUL 
AZIZ, WILL LIKELY GATHER INFORMALLY AND QUIETLY TO 
ASSESS THE KING\'S CONDITION.  THEY WILL BE MOTIVATED TO 
PROJECT AN AURA OF STABILITY, CONTINUITY, FAMILY UNITY, 
AND CONTINUED LOYALTY TO KING FAHD.  ALMOST CERTAINLY, 
THE IMMEDIATE CONSENSUS WILL BE THAT CROWN PRINCE 
ABDULLAH SHOULD BE ASKED TO ACT IN THE NAME OF THE 
KING.  SENIOR ULEMA, THE OTHER PILLAR OF THE SAUDI 
REGIME, ARE LIKELY TO TACITLY AGREE.  THE COUNCIL OF 
MINISTERS, COMPOSED PARTLY OF NONROYALS, WILL NOT PLAY A 
ROLE IN ANY DECISION THAT IS REACHED. 
 
5.  (C) OUTSIDE THE FAMILY CONSULTATIONS, THE SAG IS 
LIKELY TO KEEP MEDIA REPORTS AND SPECULATION ABOUT THE 
KING\'S HEALTH TO A MINIMUM.  POSITIVE BULLETINS ARE 
LIKELY TO BE STANDARD FARE.  WE CAN ALSO EXPECT EVEN 
MORE STEPPED-UP SECURITY PRECAUTIONS AT PUBLIC BUILDINGS 
AND IN THE COUNTRY GENERALLY, IN A BID TO MINIMIZE 
CHANCES OF A SECOND TERRORIST ATTACK OR OTHER POLITICAL 
VIOLENCE IN A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY. 
 
6.  (C) OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WEEKS, ASSUMING 
FAHD\'S CONDITION REMAINS STABLE, ABDULLAH IS UNLIKELY TO 
BE DESIGNATED AS REGENT, IF ONLY BECAUSE THE ONLY 
PRECEDENT FOR THE NEW SITUATION IS THE FAMILY\'S DECISION 
TO TRANSFER KING SAUD\'S POWERS TO CP FAYSAL AS REGENT IN 
1964.  THE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SITUATIONS 
IS THAT SAUD WAS REMOVED BECAUSE OF INCOMPETENCE AND NOT 
FOR REASONS OF PHYSICAL INCAPACITY.  CROWN PRINCE 
ABDULLAH REGULARLY CHAIRS THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND 
HAS LONG BEEN PROJECTED TO THE NATION, AND TREATED, AS 
THE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED NO. TWO BEHIND THE KING.  WE 
HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD NOT EFFECTIVELY 
STEP FORWARD, WITH FULL FAMILY BACKING, AT THIS TIME. 
 
7.  (C) ADDING TO THE INNATE CONSERVATISM OF THE AL SAUD 
AND THE FAMILY\'S LONG TRADITION OF MAINTAINING COHESION 
AND SOLIDARITY WILL BE CONCERN WITH TH SECURITY 
ENVIRONMENT FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 13 OMBING ATTACK ON 
OPM/SANG.  BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN WIDELY VIEWED AS AN 
ATTACK ON THE REGIME AS MUCH AS ON THE U.S., THE SENIOR 
PRINCES WILL BE FURTHER ENCOURAGED TO AVOID ANY 
APPEARANCE OF DISUNITY BY DEVIATING FROM THE ESTABLISHED 
LINE OF AUTHORITY OR SUCCESSION. 
 
8.  (C) IN SUM, IN THE SHORT TERM (DEFINED AS OVER THE 
NEXT 30 OR SO DAYS), WE ANTICIPATE A SMOOTH AND PEACEFUL 
EMPHASIS ON MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO. 
DECISION-MAKING, NEVER A RAPID PROCESS IN SAUDI ARABIA, 
MAY SLOW DOWN CONSIDERABLY, ESPECIALLY AS ABDULLAH WILL 
CAREFULLY AVOID ANY SIGN OF PRESUMING FAHD\'S PERMANENT 
REMOVAL FROM OFFICE OR BY INAPPROPRIATELY ACTING AS IF 
HE WERE KING. 
 
9.  (C) LOOKING AHEAD FURTHER THAN A MONTH, THE KING\'S 
ACTUAL MEDICAL CONDITION WILL DETERMINE WHAT DECISIONS 
THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS WILL TAKE.  A PROGNOSIS OF A SLOW 
BUT SURE RECOVERY OF FAHD\'S FACULTIES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY 
LEAD THE ELDERS TO CONCUR IN THE NEW STATUS QUO.  A 
PROGNOSIS OF PROLONGED OR PERMANENT INCAPACITATION WOULD 
FORCE THE COUNCIL, I.E. THE AL SAUD, TO THEN ADDRESS THE 
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF ACTUAL SUCCESSION.  AT THIS 
JUNCTURE, WE HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE PRIME OBJECTIVE 
AGAIN WILL BE TO PROJECT AN IMAGE OF CONTROL, STABILITY, 
AND CONTINUITY. 
 
10.  (C) SHOULD FAHD\'S MEDICAL CONDITION DETERIORATE AND 
HE DIE, THE INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM OUTLINED ABOVE WOULD 
ALSO COME INTO PLAY.  UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ROLE 
OF THE ULEMA MIGHT BE MORE VISIBLY ENHANCED AS THE NEW 
KING - CP ABDULLAH RAISED TO THE THRONE - WOULD REQUIRE 
THEIR FORMAL SANCTION.  IN A SENSE, THE KING\'S DEATH, 
WHILE PRECIPITATING COMPLEX SCENARIOS OF POWER TRANSFER 
TO CP ABDULLAH AND SPECULATION ABOUT WHO WILL FOLLOW 
ABDULLAH, WOULD BE SIMPLER, IF ONLY BECAUSE THE CURRENT 
LINE OF SUCCESSION IS SO WELL ESTABLISHED.  WE SEE 
LITTLE CHANCE THAT THE CP COULD OR WOULD BE PUSHED 
ASIDE; NOR, IN FACT, DO WE BELIEVE THAT MINDEF SULTAN, 
CURRENTLY THIRD IN LINE TO THE THRONE, WOULD MAKE SUCH A 
PLAY.  EVEN LESS LIKELY WOULD BE AN ATTEMPT BY ANOTHER 
PRINCE - WHETHER ANOTHER SON OF ABDUL AZIZ OR A GRANDSON 
- TO SECURE POWER.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (C)  ACCORDING TO PRINCE BANDAR BIN SULTAN, KING 
FAHD IS EXPECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE RECOVERY FROM THE 
MILD STROKE HE SUFFERED NOVEMBER 30.  HOSPITAL SOURCES 
REPORT THE KING IS ANTICIPATED TO CHECK OUT FROM THE 
HOSPITAL ON DECEMBER 7.  A ROYAL COURT STATEMENT, ISSUED 
ON DECEMBER 3, ATTRIBUTED THE KING\'S HOSPITAL ADMITTANCE 
TO WORK RELATED FATIGUE, BUT ADMITTED TO THE PRESENCE OF 
A SPECIAL TEAM OF AMERICAN MEDICAL EXPERTS.  HOWEVER, 
THE PUBLIC BAROMETER OF THE KING\'S HEALTH IS WHETHER AND 
WHEN HE APPEARS ON TELEVISION.  THIS APPEARANCE, 
PREDICTED BY MINDEF SULTAN TO OCCUR ON DECEMBER 3, DID 
NOT TAKE PLACE.  CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH IS ATTENDING THE 
GCC SUMMIT IN THE KING\'S STEAD BUT, GIVEN THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS ATTENDANCE, IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO 
ADVANCE ANY SIGNIFICANT INITIATIVES.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
ROYAL COURT ATTRIBUTES COLLAPSE TO FATIGUE 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (U)  A STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE ROYAL COURT, MID-DAY 
DECEMBER 3, QUOTES AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE KING FAYSAL 
SPECIALIST HOSPITAL THAT KING FAHD\'S HEALTH IS 
\"REASSURING AND DOES NOT CALL FOR CONCERN.\"  THE 
HOSPITAL RELEASE ATTRIBUTED THE \"SUDDEN HEALTH PROBLEM\" 
WHICH AFFLICTED THE KING TO THE \"PRESSURES OF WORK AND 
TO ENSUING FATIGUE.\"  CONSEQUENTLY, THE DOCTORS, 
INCLUDING A MEDICAL TEAM FLOWN IN FROM THE U.S. TO 
PERFORM ADDITIONAL TESTS, HAVE PRESCRIBED \"REST AND 
RECUPERATION.\" 
 
4.  (C)  WHILE OBSCURING THE FACT THAT THE KING SUFFERED 
FROM A TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK OR A MILD STROKE, THE 
ROYAL COURT\'S STATEMENT IS DISTINGUISHED BY THE CANDOR 
IN WHICH IT ADMITS THE ARRIVAL OF A TEAM OF AMERICAN 
MEDICAL EXPERTS.  THE SAUDI PUBLIC, TAKING NOTE OF THE 
DELUGE OF CABLES FROM WORLD LEADERS WISHING THE KING 
GOOD HEALTH AND THE ADMISSION THAT FOREIGN EXPERTS WERE 
CONSULTED, ARE AWARE THAT THE KING WAS ADMITTED FOR 
SOMETHING OTHER THAN \"ROUTINE MEDICAL EXAMS.\"  HOWEVER, 
THE THREE STATEMENTS ISSUED TO DATE BY THE ROYAL COURT 
HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN SILENCING MORE DIRE SPECULATIONS. 
 
--------------------------------- 
PRINCE BANDAR ON UNCLE\'S RECOVERY 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  IN A LATE EVENING DISCUSSION ON DECEMBER 2, 
PRINCE BANDAR BIN SULTAN (WHO ACCOMPANIED THE AMERICAN 
MEDICAL TEAM TO RIYADH) ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT KING 
FAHD WOULD MAKE A COMPLETE RECOVERY.  HE PREDICTED THAT 
THE KING WOULD REMAIN IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 5-10 DAYS. 
THE MEDICAL TEAM WAS TO DECIDE ON A COURSE OF TREATMENT 
FOR THE KING ON DECEMBER 3.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE KING 
IS SITTING UP, EATING, AND CONVERSING WITH FAMILY 
MEMBERS.  (\"AL HAYAT\" ON DECEMBER 4 REPORTED THAT THE 
KING HELD A DINNER MEETING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS ON 
DECEMBER 3.)  THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT TO THE KING\'S 
RECUPERATION, ACCORDING TO BANDAR, ARE THE THRONG OF 
FAMILY MEMBERS HOVERING IN AND AROUND THE KING\'S SUITE. 
BANDAR BLAMED THE KING, WHO PERIODICALLY ASKS WHERE A 
PARTICULAR MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IS, FOR EXACERBATING THE 
THE AL SAUD\'S INSTINCT TO GATHER ROUND IN TIMES OF 
FAMILY CRISIS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
KING\'S HEALTH: DELAYED TV APPEARANCE, CHECK-OUT DATE 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6.  (C)  CONFUSION AS TO WHEN THE KING WILL APPEAR ON 
TELEVISION TO DEMONSTRATE HIS RECOVERY HAS RESULTED IN 
AMBIGUITY REGARDING HIS REAL HEALTH STATUS.  ON DECEMBER 
3, MINDEF SULTAN TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE HAD MOVED 
UP HIS APPOINTMENT FROM 1330 TO 1100 IN ORDER TO BE ON 
HAND FOR A TELEVISION CREW\'S FILMING OF THE KING FOR THE 
BROADCAST THAT NIGHT.  NO SUCH BROADCAST OCCURRED. 
FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD AL FAYSAL WAS QUOTED IN THE 
DECEMBER 4 \"AL HAYAT\" AS SAYING THAT KING FAHD WOULD 
APPEAR ON TELEVISION TO DISCUSS HIS HEALTH WITH THE 
SAUDI PEOPLE.  CLEARLY, THE TELEVISION APPEARANCE HAS 
BECOME A DE FACTO BAROMETER OF THE KING\'S TRUE STANDING. 
 
7.  (C)  THERE IS NO INFORMATION EMANATING FROM CONTACTS 
AT THE KING FAYSAL HOSPITAL TO SUGGEST THAT THE KING IS 
\"COUNTING HIS LAST HOURS\" (REFTEL B).  TO THE CONTRARY, 
THE KING REPORTEDLY IS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL 
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7.  THE DCM, WHO WAS AT THE HOSPITAL 
ON DECEMBER 4, SAW NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY.  ONE DOCTOR, WHO 
IS NOT ON FAHD\'S MEDICAL TEAM, CLAIMED THE KING WAS 
\"DOING FINE.\"  THE DELAY IN THE TELEVISION APPEARANCE 
MAY BE A FUNCTION OF RECTIFYING THE IMAGE OF A FATIGUED 
MONARCH.  ACCORDING TO ONE HOSPITAL SOURCE, WHEN THE 
KING ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL HE WAS SUFFERING PARALYSIS 
TO THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE; ALTHOUGH THE CONDITION 
QUICKLY PASSED, THERE MAY BE SOME RESIDUAL SAGGING OF 
THE FACIAL MUSCLES.  THE FACT THAT THE KING\'S PRIVATE 
SECRETARY LEVELLED WITH THE AMBASSADOR AS TO THE KING\'S 
HEALTH STATUS ON THE DAY OF HIS ADMITTANCE TO THE 
HOSPITAL, POST IS CONFIDENT ANY DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE 
KING\'S HEALTH WOULD BE REVEALED TO US.

THE CROWN PRINCE WAS DISPATCHED TO MUSCAT TO ATTEND THE

TAGS:  PTER, SA 
SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA:  1995 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 245276 
 
1.  THE FOLLOWING ARE KEYED TO POINTS IN REFTEL. 
 
A.  (U)  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 13 BOMBING OF THE 
RIYADH HEADQUARTERS OF THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, 
SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL GUARD (OPM/SANG), WHICH KILLED SEVEN 
PERSONS, INCLUDING FIVE AMERICANS, AND INJURED MORE THAN FORTY 
OTHERS, THE SAG LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE INVESTIGATION IN FULL 
COOPERATION WITH THE USG.  THIS INCLUDED PROVIDING COMPLETE 
SUPPORT TO AN FBI INVESTIGATION TEAM.  INCREASED SECURITY 
MEASURES FOR AMERICAN FACILITIES WERE INSTITUTED UNDER THE 
DIRECTION OF SENIOR SAUDI LEADERS, AND THE TWO GOVERNMENTS 
ENTERED INTO A DEEPER DIALOGUE ON COUNTERTERRORISM MEASURES IN 
GENERAL.  THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES APACE.  THERE WERE NO 
OTHER ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM, BY DEPARTMENT OF STATE DEFINITION, IN SAUDI 
ARABIA THIS YEAR, AND NO CASES ARE PENDING FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. 
 
B.  (U)  THE SAG WAS NOT FORTHCOMING WHEN THE USG, ACTING ON A 
TIP FROM AN INFORMANT, REQUESTED SAUDI ASSISTANCE IN DETAINING 
A TERRORIST IDENTIFIED IN PRESS REPORTS AS HIZBALLAH SPECIAL 
SECURITY CHIEF IMAD MUGHNIYAH.  THE LATTER WAS REPORTEDLY 
SCHEDULED TO MAKE A STOPOVER APRIL 7 IN JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA, 
EN ROUTE FROM KHARTOUM TO BEIRUT.  THE USG REQUESTED THAT THE 
SAUDIS ARREST MUGHNIYAH UPON ARRIVAL IN JEDDAH AND TURN HIM 
OVER TO OFFICIALS FOR TRANSPORT TO THE UNITED STATES TO STAND 
TRIAL FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE HIJACKING OF TWA FLIGHT 847 IN 
1985.  THE SAG REFUSED THE PLANE PERMISSION TO LAND IN SAUDI 
ARABIA. 
 
C.  (U)  THERE ARE NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS TO SAG 
PROSECUTION OF PERSONS COMMITTING TERRORIST ACTS WITHIN SAUDI 
ARABIA.  NO FORMAL EXTRADITION TREATIES EXIST BETWEEN SAUDI 
ARABIA AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. 
 
D.  (U)  SAUDI LEADERS AT EVERY LEVEL--INCLUDING KING FAHD, 
CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH, AND CABINET MINISTERS--ISSUED FORCEFUL 
STATEMENTS CONDEMNING THE NOVEMBER 13 OPM/SANG BOMBING AND ITS 
PERPETRATORS.  OFFICIAL MEDIA CARRIED EXTENSIVE REPORTS OF 
CONDEMNATION OF THE ATTACK ON U.S. FACILITIES ISSUED BY PUBLIC, 
RELIGIOUS, AND PRIVATE GROUPS.  THE MEDIA WERE SIMILARLY 
DEPLOYED TO PUBLICIZE SAG COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES IN 
INVESTIGATING THE BOMBING AND TO APPEAL FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 
IN IDENTIFYING THE PERPETRATORS. 
 
--  IN JULY, THE SAG RELEASED A PUBLIC STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE 
KIDNAPPINGS OF THE FIVE WESTERNERS IN KASHMIR AS COUNTER TO THE 
TENETS OF ISLAM AND CALLED FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF THE 
HOSTAGES, AS DID SENIOR SAUDI RELIGIOUS LEADERS UPON THE URGING 
OF THE SAG.  IN NOVEMBER, THE SAG JOINED IN CONDEMNING THE 
ASSASSINATION OF YITZHAK RABIN AND THE BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN 
EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN. 
 
E.  (U)  THE SAG UNDERTOOK NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORUMS IN 1995.  HOWEVER, THE SAG DID CONDUCT A 
MAJOR INVESTIGATION OF THE OPM/SANG BOMBING AND PROVIDED 
OUTSTANDING SUPPORT TO THE USG\'S OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE ATTACK. 
 
F.  (U)  THE SAG OFFICIALLY DENIES IT FINANCIALLY SUPPORTS 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS OR ACTIVITIES, AND SINCE APRIL 
1993 SAUDI REGULATIONS HAVE REQUIRED NON-GOVERNMENTAL 
ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY AGENCIES COLLECTING 
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES TO OBTAIN 
FORMAL SAG AUTHORIZATION.  THERE CONTINUE TO BE UNCONFIRMED 
REPORTS OF FINANCIAL TIES BETWEEN TERRORIST GROUPS AND SOME 
PRIVATE SAUDI-BASED NGOS. 
 
G.  (U)  THE SAG DID NOT MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
ANY OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES CURRENTLY ON THE USG\'S SO-CALLED 
\"TERRORISM LIST\" ON A TERRORISM ISSUE.  ON APRIL 20, THE SAG 
ALLOWED A LIBYAN AIRLINES JET CARRYING LIBYAN HAJJ PILGRIMS TO 
LAND AT JEDDAH\'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, BE SERVICED, AND DEPART 
IN VIOLATION OF UNSC SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON LIBYA BECAUSE OF ITS 
INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THREE WEEKS PRIOR TO 
THE FLIGHT, MINISTER OF INTERIOR PRINCE NAIF HAD COMMENTED 
PUBLICLY THAT ALL PILGRIMS WITH VALID HAJJ VISAS WOULD BE 
RECEIVED BY SAUDI ARABIA, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MEANS OF 
TRANSPORTATION. 
 
H.  (U)  THE UNSOLVED NOVEMBER 13 BOMBING OF THE OPM/SANG 
HEADQUARTERS IN RIYADH HAS GREATLY HEIGHTENED SAG CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE THREAT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT 
ALSO DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POTENTIAL FOR FOREIGN-SPONSORED 
INCIDENTS, INCLUDING DURING HAJJ.  ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, 
THERE MAY ALSO EXIST OFFICIAL CONCERN THAT THE WAR IN 
AFGHANISTAN ATTRACTED SAUDI AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED 
TRAINING IN THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES AND OTHER WEAPONS.  SUCH 
INDIVIDUALS MAY NOW ENGAGE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN THE ARAB 
WORLD AND ELSEWHERE, INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA.

1.  CLASSIFIED BY DCM THEODORE KATTOUF: 1.5B. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 

2.  (C)  THE BODY OF EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT CONTRARY 
TO SOME PUBLISHED REPORTS, PRINCE MISH\'AL (AS WELL AS 
THE DECEASED PRINCE ABD AL-MUHSIN) WAS BORN BEFORE 
MINDEF SULTAN.  HOWEVER, MISH\'AL\'S SENIORITY IN AGE DOES 
NOT MAKE HIM A SUCCESSION CANDIDATE, SUFFERING AS HE 
DOES FROM SEVERAL STRIKES: A NON-SAUDI MATERNAL LINEAGE, 
A LACKLUSTER RECORD IN GOVERNMENT OFFICE, AND A 
REPUTATION FOR ARGUING WITH HIS BROTHERS.  SULTAN\'S 
ECLIPSE OF MISH\'AL, THE SEVENTH TIME A SENIOR SON OF 
KING ABD AL-AZIZ HAS BEEN PASSED OVER, IS A MEASURE OF 
THE STRICT CRITERIA APPLIED TO SUCCESSION CANDIDATES. 
END SUMMARY 
 
----------------------- 
PRINCE MISH\'AL IS OLDER 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  IN A SEARCH OF OUR BIOGRAPHIC FILES, AND IN 
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UK EMBASSY ROYAL FAMILY WATCHER, 
THERE APPEARS TO BE DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE THAT BOTH 
MISH\'AL BIN ABD AL-AZIZ AND ABD AL-MUHSIN BIN ABD 
AL-AZIZ ARE/WERE OLDER THAN MINDEF SULTAN.  ABD 
AL-MUHSIN\'S DEATH IN 1985 MAKES THE POINT MOOT, BUT 
MISH\'AL\'S SENIORITY IN AGE OVER SULTAN ADDS TO THE BODY 
OF EVIDENCE THAT THE INNER CIRCLE OF THE AL SAUD CAN AND 
DO EXCLUDE FROM SUCCESSION THOSE FOUND LACKING IN 
LINEAGE, LEADERSHIP, AND PERSONAL CHARACTER. 
HISTORICALLY, MISH\'AL\'S SENIORITY TO SULTAN WAS EVIDENT 
IN: 
 
-- THE MARCH 29, 1964 PETITION BY MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL 
FAMILY URGING CROWN PRINCE FAYSAL TO EXERCISE THE POWERS 
OF KING:  MISH\'AL, THEN THE AMIR OF MECCA, WAS THE 20TH 
SIGNATOR (ABD AL-MUHSIN WAS 17TH), WHILE MINDEF SULTAN 
WAS THE 24TH. 
 
-- PRESS REPORTS OF THE DEATH OF KING KHALID IN 1982: 
MISH\'AL, THEN OUT OF GOVERNMENT, WAS LISTED AHEAD OF 
MINDEF SULTAN IN THE REPORT OF THOSE ATTENDING THE 
FUNERAL PRAYER. 
 
-- REFTEL (A) ACCOUNTS OF THE FUNERAL OF THE SAUD 
AL-KABIR ELDER: AGAIN, PROTOCOL PLACED MISH\'AL AHEAD OF 
SULTAN. 
 
-- KING FAHD\'S DECEMBER 5, 1995 HOSPITAL MAJLIS: MOST 
RECENTLY, THE TELEVISED HOSPITAL MAJLIS, IN WHICH THE 
KING\'S BROTHERS WERE SEATED ALONG THE WALL IN STRICT 
BIRTH PECKING ORDER, HAD MISH\'AL SECOND TO BANDAR BIN 
ABD AL-AZIZ.  SEATED NEXT TO MISH\'AL WAS SULTAN. 
 
4.  (C)  THE UK EMBASSY ROYAL WATCHER CHECKED THEIR COPY 
OF LEES\' \"HANDBOOK OF THE AL SAUD,\" WHICH WE BELIEVE IS 
THE SOURCE OF THE MISINFORMATION, AND REPORTED THAT 
SOMEONE HAD ANNOTATED THE BOOK IN PEN TO REFLECT BOTH 
MISH\'AL\'S AND ABD AL-MUHSIN\'S SENIORITY TO SULTAN. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
MISH\'AL BOWS OUT OF SUCCESSION - ALBEIT UNGRACEFULLY 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5.  (S)  IN MARCH 1992, THE CROWN PRINCE\'S PRINCIPAL 
ADVISER, SHAYKH ABD AL-MUHSIN AL-TUWAIJRI, RELATED 
MISH\'AL\'S EXTREME UNHAPPINESS WITH NOT BEING SELECTED 
SECOND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER IN 1982, DESPITE HIS 
SENIORITY IN AGE TO MINDEF SULTAN.  ACCORDING TO 
TUWAIJRI, THE DESIGNATION OF SULTAN WAS MADE QUICKLY AND 
ONLY BY THE THREE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED -- FAHD, 
ABDULLAH, AND SULTAN.  TUWAIJRI NOTED THAT MISH\'AL 
COMPLAINED TO BANDAR BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, WHO TOOK UP HIS 
CAUSE. 
 
6.  (C)  IN THE INTERVENING YEARS, HOWEVER, MISH\'AL HAS 
RECONCILED HIMSELF TO THE FACT THAT HIS IMMEDIATE 
BROTHERS FIND HIM LACKING IN THE QUALITIES THEY DESIRE 
IN A KING.  (NOTE: MISH\'AL HAD THREE STRIKES AGAINST 
HIM: HIS NON-SAUDI MATERNAL LINEAGE, HIS LACKLUSTER 
RECORD AS A PUBLIC SERVANT, AND HIS ARGUMENTATIVE 
REPUTATION.)  THIS RECOGNITION HAS BEEN MADE PUBLICLY 
AND PRIVATELY.  IN A 1992 INTERVIEW WITH THE SAUDI 
NEWSPAPER \"AL-MADINAH,\" MISH\'AL DECLARED HIS FEALTY TO 
FAHD AND ABDULLAH AND NOTED THAT \"I PERSONALLY DO NOT 
ENVY THEIR LIVES WHICH ARE FULL OF SERVICE FOR ALL; 
WHOEVER LEADS SUCH A LIFE MUST BE SHOULDERING A 
BURDENSOME DUTY.\"  AND, IN A JUNE 1995 CONVERSATION WITH 
THE AMBASSADOR, MISH\'AL STATED THAT HE HOPED \"NEVER TO 
BE AN OFFICIAL.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
COMMENT: MANIPULATING THE SUCCESSION 
------------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C)  TAKING INTO ACCOUNT MISH\'AL AND ABD AL-MUHSIN\'S 
CHRONOLOGICAL SENIORITY TO SULTAN, ON SEVEN OCCASIONS 
THE SONS OF KING ABD AL-AZIZ HAVE PASSED OVER WOULD-BE 
CONTENDERS TO THE POSITION OF KING.  WHILE SENIORITY IS 
CRITICAL TO ENTERING THE SUCCESSION LINE-UP (AS SECOND 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OR CROWN PRINCE), SO TOO ARE 
MATERNAL SAUDI LINEAGE, PERSONAL CHARACTER, AND 
DEMONSTRATED LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL.  MEASURED AGAINST 
THESE CRITERIA, ONLY A HANDFUL OF THE 25 SURVIVING SONS 
OF KING ABD AL-AZIZ SHOULD REALISTICALLY BE CONSIDERED 
PRESENT AND POTENTIAL POWERBROKERS.  SEPTEL WILL ANALYZE 
SUCCESSION POSSIBILITIES.

2.  (U)  SUMMARY:  ANALYSIS OF THE BULLETINS AND 
COMMUNIQUES ISSUED BY THE THE COMMITTEE FOR THE DEFENSE 
OF LEGITIMATE RIGHTS (CDLR) DURING THE PAST FOUR WEEKS 
REVEALS TWO MAIN THEMES OF NOTE.  FIRST, THE CDLR CITES 
THE CAR BOMBING AT THE OPM/SANG HEADQUARTERS IN RIYADH 
AS VINDICATION OF ITS WARNINGS THAT SUCH ATTACKS WERE 
INEVITABLE UNDER A CORRUPT REGIME WITH UNACCEPTABLY 
CLOSE TIES TO THE UNITED STATES.  SECOND, THE CDLR HAS 
ATTEMPTED TO CAPITALIZE ON KING FAHD\'S ILL HEALTH TO 
DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH AND MINISTER 
OF DEFENSE AND CIVIL AVIATION PRINCE SULTAN WHO, AS 
SECOND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, IS SECOND IN LINE TO THE 
THRONE AFTER ABDULLAH.  THE CDLR COMMUNIQUES IMPLY THAT, 
EVEN THOUGH CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH IS AN AL SAUD, HE 
WOULD BE PREFERABLE AS A RULER TO FAHD OR ANY OF FAHD\'S 
FULL BROTHERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------ 
BOMBING FOREWARNED 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  THE LONDON-BASED SAUDI DISSIDENT GROUP CDLR 
DISSEMINATED A COMMUNIQUE THE DAY AFTER THE NOVEMBER 13 
TERRORIST BOMBING OF OPM/SANG HEADQUARTERS IN RIYADH 
CITING ITS PREVIOUS WARNINGS THAT SUCH INCIDENTS WERE 
EXPECTED BECAUSE OF WHAT IT CALLED THE REPRESSION, 
ARREST, IMPRISONMENT, AND TORTURE OF REFORMERS BY THE AL 
SAUD GOVERNMENT AND THE USG\'S ALLEGED COMPLICITY IN 
THOSE CRIMES.  THOUGH THE CDLR CLAIMED NOT TO BE 
SURPRISED BY THE BOMBING INCIDENT, IT INSISTED THAT IT 
HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT GROUP OR PERSONS WERE 
RESPONSIBLE. 
 
3.  (U)  IN A BULLETIN ISSUED NOVEMBER 22, THE CDLR 
CITED UPRISINGS FROM THE SAUDI PAST TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT 
IT CONSIDERED A HISTORICAL PATTERN OF LINKS BETWEEN 
EPISODES OF CLOSE TIES TO THE WEST AND VIOLENT RESPONSES 
FROM THE SAUDI PEOPLE.  IN THE 1920S, IT NOTED, 
SUSPICIONS AROSE THAT ABD AL-AZIZ WAS A MERE AGENT OF 
BRITAIN, AND THE RESULT WAS THE BLOODY IKHWAN UPRISING. 
IN 1979, JUHAYMAN AL-OTAIBI LED A TAKEOVER OF THE GRAND 
MOSQUE IN MECCA IN A SHOW OF THE PEOPLE\'S ANGER AT THE 
WESTERN-TILTING AL SAUDS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4.  (U)  CLEARLY, THE CDLR WISHES TO DRAW A PARALLEL TO 
THE CLOSE SAUDI-U.S. RELATIONSHIP UNDER FAHD AND WHAT IT 
CONSIDERS A JUSTIFIABLY ANGRY RESPONSE TO THAT 
RELATIONSHIP FROM THE SAUDI PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE 
GULF WAR:  THE SIGNING OF JOINT PETITIONS, THE RISE AND 
IMPRISONMENT OF ISLAMIST ULEMA, AND NOW THE OPM/SANG 
BOMBING.  ACCORDING TO THE CDLR, PEOPLE--OUTSIDERS AS 
WELL AS SAUDIS--MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ASSUMING THAT THE 
NATIVES OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA HAVE A PEACEFUL NATURE 
WHEN, IN FACT, WHAT CONTROLS THE INNATE ANGER OF THE 
REGION\'S PEOPLE IS THE UMBRELLA OF RELIGION.  THE 
IMPLICATION HERE IS A THEME FAMILIAR FROM PREVIOUS CDLR 
MISSIVES:  IN THE ABSENCE OF TRUE ISLAMIC RULE, AND 
TRULY ISLAMIC RULERS, THE PEOPLE WILL SHOW THEIR 
AGGRESSIVE SIDE.  END COMMENT. 
 
--------------------------------- 
WEDGE BETWEEN ABDULLAH AND SULTAN 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  IN SUBSEQUENT FAXES ISSUED DECEMBER 11 AND 13, 
THE CDLR CHARGED THAT KING FAHD REMAINED PARALYZED 
FOLLOWING HIS HOSPITALIZATION FOR A STROKE AND THAT HIS 
DECEMBER 5 TELEVISED HOSPITAL MAJLIS WAS A GIANT BLUFF 
USING FILE FOOTAGE.  ACCORDING TO CLDR\'S VERSION OF 
EVENTS, THE HOAX WAS ENGINEERED BY THE OTHER SUDAYRI 
BROTHERS--PRINCES SULTAN, SALMAN, AND NAYIF--TO 
STRENGTHEN THEIR POSITION AND HEAD OFF THE ASCENSION TO 
THE THRONE OF HALF-BROTHER ABDULLAH. 
 
6.  (U)  THE CDLR CLAIMED FURTHER THAT SULTAN USED 
ABDULLAH\'S ABSENCE DURING THE RECENT GCC SUMMIT IN 
MUSCAT TO APPEAL IN VAIN TO THE ULAMA TO DECLARE HIM THE 
SUCCESSOR TO FAHD AND TO STRIP ABDULLAH OF HIS COMMAND 
OF THE NATIONAL GUARD, PLACING IN HIS STEAD HIS FULL 
BROTHER PRINCE ABDULRAHMAN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, SULTAN\'S 
DEPUTY AT MODA.  THE DECEMBER 11 CDLR COMMUNIQUE 
SEPARATES ABDULLAH FROM THE REST OF THE AL SAUD PACK 
(IDENTIFYING HIM AS \"THE OTHER PARTY\") AND EXHORTS HIM 
TO ASSUME HIS HISTORIC RESPONSIBILITY TO REASSERT SAUDI 
ARABIA\'S LEADERSHIP IN ESTABLISHING ISLAMIC JUSTICE, 
DEFENDING THE PROSELYTIZATION OF ISLAM, RESPECTING 
REFORMERS, AND RIDDING THE NATION OF FOREIGN 
HEGEMONISTS.  THE COMMUNIQUE CONCLUDES WITH AN APPEAL 
FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF ALL DETAINEES. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  THE CDLR\'S HARSH DESCRIPTION OF PRINCES SULTAN, 
SALMAN, AND NAYIF AS CRIMINALS WITH BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS 
IS NOT SURPRISING OR EVEN NEW.  SALMAN, AS GOVERNOR OF 
RIYADH, DEALT FACE-TO-FACE WITH CDLR SPOKESMAN MUHAMMAD 
AL-MASARI AND HIS FOLLOWERS WHEN THEY WERE FIRST 
DETAINED.  MINISTER OF INTERIOR PRINCE NAYIF OVERSAW 
MASARI\'S INCARCERATION IN AL-HAYR PRISON.  SULTAN--FULL 
BROTHER TO KING FAHD, SALMAN, AND NAYIF--FITS EASILY 
INTO THE GROUP.  AS MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND CIVIL 
AVIATION, HE IS CLOSELY TIED TO THE WELCOMING OF WESTERN 
COALITION FORCES TO THE PENINSULA DURING OPERATIONS 
DESERT SHIELD AND DESERT STORM--AN IMPORTANT POINT OF 
CONTENTION FOR CDLR.  AND AS SECOND IN LINE TO THE 
THRONE, SULTAN IS THE SUDAYRI MOST LIKELY TO BECOME KING. 
 
8.  (C)  WHAT IS UNUSUAL IN THE FAXES IS THE CDLR\'S 
SEPARATE APPEAL TO CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH, WHOM THEY 
DISTINGUISH FROM OTHER RULING AL SAUDS WHO \"DISTORT THE 
IMAGE OF ISLAM.\"  BY IMPLYING THAT ABDULLAH COULD SERVE 
AS A MEANINGFUL ALTERNATIVE TO SUDAYRI RULE, CDLR PLAYS 
TO THE PERCEPTION COMMON AMONG SAUDIS THAT ABDULLAH IS A 
MORE ETHICAL MAN THAN FAHD, THAT HE CARES MORE FOR HIS 
COUNTRY, THAT HE \"PANDERS\" LESS TO THE WEST AND AMERICA 
IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT HIS REIGN AS KING WOULD BE FAR 
LESS CORRUPT THAN FAHD\'S. 
 
9.  (C)  IT IS DOUBTFUL THE CDLR ACTUALLY BELIEVES THIS 
ASSESSMENT, SINCE ABDULLAH WOULD NOT FURTHER THE 
ORGANIZATION\'S TRUE, LONG-TERM GOALS--THE CREATION OF AN 
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE AL SAUD.  BUT 
BY PRESENTING ITSELF AS SYMPATHETIC TO CHANGE UNDER 
ABDULLAH, THE CDLR CAN ALIGN ITSELF WITH A RELATIVELY 
POPULAR BELIEF AMONG SAUDIS IN GENERAL.  THE CDLR MAY 
ALSO BE ATTEMPTING TO POSITION ITSELF FOR AN APPEAL FOR 
THE RELEASE OF THE REMAINING ISLAMIST DETAINEES ONCE 
ABDULLAH BECOMES KING.  AT THE SAME TIME, CDLR SPOKESMAN 
MUHAMMAD MASARI MAY HAVE IT IN MIND TO REASSURE THE 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT, AT A POINT WHEN HE IS UNDER 
SUSPICION OF HAVING LINKS TO THE OPM/SANG BOMBING (REF 
A), THAT HIS ORGANIZATION IS NOT REALLY COMMITTED TO THE 
VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF THE AL SAUDS BUT CAN WORK FOR 
CHANGE WITHIN THE SYSTEM.  END COMMENT.

2.  (C)  SPECULATION THAT THE CROWN PRINCE ANGRILY 
DEPARTED FOR HAFR AL-BATIN FOLLOWING KING FAHD\'S 
RESUMPTION OF FULL GOVERNING POWERS ON FEBRUARY 21 IS 
DISMISSED BY SOURCES WITHIN THE SAUDI ARABIA NATIONAL 
GUARD AND AMONG ABDULLAH\'S ADVISERS.  NONETHELESS, THE 
NUMBER OF SENIOR PRINCES WHO ACCOMPANIED THE CROWN 
PRINCE ON HIS FAMILY CAMPING TRIP ILLUSTRATES THE 
POLITICAL ALLIANCES WHICH ABDULLAH HAS CULTIVATED TO 
OFFSET THE DOMINATION OF THE NUMEROUS AND POWERFULLY 
POSITIONED SUDAYRI BROTHERS.  THE FAMILY ENCLAVE 
DEMONSTRATES PUBLICLY ABDULLAH\'S STRONG BASE AMONG THE 
SURVIVING SONS OF KING ABD AL-AZIZ.  END SUMMARY 
 
-------------------------------------- 
ABDULLAH PITCHES TENT IN HAFR AL-BATIN 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  ON FEBRUARY 22, THE DAY AFTER FAHD UNEXPECTEDLY 
RESUMED FULL GOVERNING POWERS WHICH ENDED THE CROWN 
PRINCE\'S TWO MONTH REGENCY, ABDULLAH DEPARTED RIYADH FOR 
AN OPULENT FAMILY CAMPING TRIP IN THE NORTH-EASTERN 
CORNER OF THE KINGDOM, AT HAFR AL-BATIN.  SOURCES WITHIN 
THE SAUDI ARABIA NATIONAL GUARD DISMISS RUMORS THAT 
ABDULLAH LEFT IN A HUFF, NOTING THAT SUCH A DESERT 
OUTING IS NORMAL FOR THE CROWN PRINCE, BUT HAD BEEN 
DELAYED WHILE HE FILLED IN FOR FAHD.  ACCORDING TO ONE 
OF THE CROWN PRINCE\'S ADVISERS, ABDULLAH DEPARTED 
QUICKLY FOR HAFR AL-BATIN SINCE HIS PRESENCE IN THE 
CAPITAL IS REQUIRED PRIOR TO THE START OF THE ANNUAL 
SANG-SPONSORED CULTURAL FESTIVAL, JANADRIYYAH, SLATED TO 
BEGIN MARCH 7. 
 
4.  (C)  SOME ROYAL OBSERVERS ARGUE THAT ABDULLAH\'S 
RETREAT TO HAFR IS A REFLECTION OF THE KING\'S 
SATISFACTION WITH THE CP\'S GOVERNING PERFORMANCE SINCE 
THE ROYAL CAMP SITE IS TRADITIONALLY THE PRESERVE OF 
FAHD AND HIS INTIMATES.  ONLY TRUSTED AIDES, CLOSE 
ADVISERS, AND IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS ACCOMPANY THE 
KING ON HIS TRIPS TO HAFR, A SITE WHICH HAS BEEN USED TO 
FETE BOTH PRESIDENT CLINTON AND FORMER SECSTATE SHULTZ. 
LENDING WEIGHT TO THIS INTERPRETATION IS THE FACT THAT 
WHEN THE CROWN PRINCE HAS SOUGHT TO COMMUNICATE HIS 
DISPLEASURE WITH ROYAL DECISIONS IN THE PAST, HE HAS 
FLOWN OFF TO MOROCCO, NOT TO THE KINGDOM\'S BEDOUIN 
INTERIOR. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
AND TAKES ALONG HIS COTERIE OF ROYAL SUPPORTERS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  (C)  THE FAMILY CONSTELLATION WHICH ACCOMPANIED 
ABDULLAH ON HIS POST-REGENCY RETREAT REPRESENTS AN 
INTRIGUING SNAP-SHOT OF WHOM, AMONG THE MORE SENIOR 
ROYAL FAMILY MEMBERS, SHARES A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE CROWN PRINCE.  THE CAMPERS INCLUDED: 
 
O    HALF-BROTHERS: 
 
THE STANDARD COTERIE OF NON-SUDAYRI HALF-BROTHERS IS

BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; HAIL GOVERNOR MUQRIN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; 
MEDINA GOVERNOR ABD AL-MAJID BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; FORMER 
QASIM GOVERNOR, ABD AL-ILAH BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; FORMER 
MECCA GOVERNOR, FAWWAZ BIN ABD AL-AZIZ; AND NAWWAF BIN 
ABD AL-AZIZ.  (COMMENT:  TO THIS GROUP, WE WOULD ADD 
FORMER TABUK GOVERNOR, MAMDUH BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, WHO, 
WHILE ABSENT FROM HAFR, TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIES THE CROWN 
PRINCE AND IS A REGULAR AT ABDULLAH\'S EVENING FAMILY 
MAJLIS.  SIMILARLY, BANDAR AND MISH\'AL BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, 
PASSED OVER IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION, ARE ALSO 
CONSIDERED NATURAL SUPPORTERS OF THE CROWN PRINCE. 
MISH\'AL TRAVELLED WITH THE CROWN PRINCE TO QASIM FOR THE 
SANG\'S NOVEMBER 1995 TRAINING EXERCISE (REFTEL), WHERE 
ABDULLAH WAS HOSTED BY BANDAR\'S SON, QASIM GOVERNOR 
FAYSAL BIN BANDAR.)  IN ALL, SEVEN OF THE EIGHTEEN 
SURVIVING, NON-SUDAYRI SONS OF KING ABD AL-AZIZ 
TRAVELLED TO HAFR. 
 
O    SONS: 
 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF KHALID BIN ABDULLAH, WHO WAS 
DISMISSED FROM THE SANG FOLLOWING POLICY DISAGREEMENTS 
WITH HIS FATHER\'S ADVISERS, ALL OF ABDULLAH\'S NINE SONS 
ARE PRESENT IN HAFR AL-BATIN.  TWO SONS, NOT PREVIOUSLY 
RECORDED IN OUR ROYAL FAMILY GENEOLOGY, ARE LISTED: 
MUHAMMAD AND MAJID.  (NOTE: THE LATTER MAY INCLUDE 
ABDULLAH\'S ONE YEAR OLD SON WHO, ACCORDING TO THE CP\'S 
PERSONAL PHYSICIAN, IS A SOURCE OF GREAT PRIDE, COMING 
AS HE DID AFTER A LONG STREAK OF DAUGHTERS.) 
 
O    YOUNGER GENERATION: 
 
IN ADDITION TO PRINCE TURKI BIN ABDULLAH BIN MUHAMMAD 
BIN SAUD AL KABIR, THE ADVISER CUM PRIVATE SECRETARY TO 
THE CROWN PRINCE, ANOTHER GROUP OF THIRD AND FOURTH 
GENERATION PRINCES PRESENT IN HAFR MAY BE ABDULLAH\'S 
SON-IN-LAWS.  ONE WHOM WE CAN POSITIVELY IDENTIFY AS A 
SON-IN-LAW (AND FELLOW EQUESTRIAN ENTHUSIAST) IS THE 
SANG WESTERN COMMANDER WHO REPLACED KHALID BIN ABDULLAH 
-- HRH PRINCE FAYSAL BIN ABDULLAH BIN MUHAMMAD AL SAUD. 
WE ARE NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF PRINCE 
FAYSAL BIN THAMIR BIN ABD AL-AZIZ (THE SOLE OFF-SPRING 
OF THAMIR, WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE IN THE U.S. IN 1957 
FOLLOWING A SEX CHANGE OPERATION) AND PRINCE KHALID BIN 
BANDAR BIN MUHAMMAD BIN ABD AL-AZIZ.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  ABDULLAH\'S ENTOURAGE ILLUSTRATES THE ALLIANCES 
HE HAS FORMED WITHIN THE ROYAL FAMILY AMONG BROTHERS 
WHOSE SENIORITY, IN TERMS OF AGE, IS NOT MATCHED BY 
PREMIER GOVERNMENT POSTINGS.  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE 
CROWN PRINCE\'S FAMILY SUPPORTERS SHARE THE SAME POLICY 
OBJECTIVES, IT IS CLEARLY IN THE PERSONAL POLITICAL 
INTERESTS OF THESE PRINCELY \"HAVE-NOTS,\" DISADVANTAGED 
BY NON-SAUDI MATERNAL LINEAGE OR A POOR RECORD IN 
GOVERNMENT OFFICE, TO BAND TOGETHER AGAINST THE TIDE OF 
SUDAYRI BROTHERS, NUMERICALLY RICH AND POWERFULLY 
POSITIONED.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEIR INCLUSION IN 
ABDULLAH\'S VACATION RETREAT REINFORCES IN THE PUBLIC 
MIND THAT WHILE THE CROWN PRINCE MAY BE AN ONLY 
(MATERNAL) CHILD, HIS FAMILY BACKING AMONG THE SURVIVING 
SONS OF ABD AL-AZIZ IS SECURE.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (C)  A SELF-CONFIDENT CROWN PRINCE, OBVIOUSLY AT 
HOME WITH HIS EXPANDED AUTHORITY, SEPARATELY LECTURED 
FORMER U.S. AMBASSADORS TO SAUDI ARABIA, A/S RICHARD 
MURPHY AND CHAS FREEMAN, ON THE UNFAIR FINANCIAL BURDEN 
THE U.S. PLACED ON SAUDI ARABIA DURING THE GULF WAR. 
ECHOING SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED MORE FORCEFULLY BY MERCHANT 
FAMILIES AND OTHER COMMONERS, ABDULLAH STATED THAT THE 
SAG SPENT \"FAR TOO MUCH\" AND QUESTIONED U.S. MOTIVES IN 
EXACTING THE FINANCIAL TOLL.  INDICATING THAT MORE 
BELT-TIGHTENING WAS IN ORDER, THE CROWN PRINCE ALLUDED 
TO THE NEED TO \"UNIFY\" THE SAUDI BUDGET, WHICH FREEMAN 
INTERPRETED TO MEAN BRINGING ON-BUDGET THE MAMMOTH 
OFF-BUDGET MONIES DEVOTED TO THE MOSQUE RECONSTRUCTION, 
AL-YAMAMAH WEAPONS DEAL, AND THE STRATEGIC (OIL) STORAGE 
PROJECT.  ABDULLAH QUESTIONED U.S. ALLEGATIONS OF A 
LIBYAN CHEMICAL CAPABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF USG 
SILENCE ON ISRAEL\'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.  FINALLY, 
ABDULLAH URGED THAT THE U.S. FIND COMMON GROUND ON WHICH 
TO CONSTRUCTIVELY, OR AT LEAST COMMERCIALLY, ENGAGE 
IRAN. 
 
3.  (C)  ABDULLAH\'S REMARKS, AND WE ASSUME THEY WERE 
CONVEYED ACCURATELY BY THE TWO FORMER AMBASSADORS, SHOW 
THAT THE CROWN PRINCE APPEARS WILLING TO CHALLENGE A 
NUMBER OF BASIC TENETS OF RULE BY THE AL FAHD.  PLACING 
THE OFF-BUDGET ITEMS IN THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET, LONG A 
GOAL OF REFORMERS HERE, WOULD WEAKEN THE ABILITY OF THE 
ROYAL FAMILY TO CARRY OUT THE PERSONAL LARGESSE THAT IT 
HAS OFTEN USED TO ENSURE FAMILY UNITY AND BUY THE 
LOYALTY OF ITS SUBJECTS.  (IT COULD ALSO PROVE 
DETRIMENTAL TO THE PALACE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.) 
OVERALL, THE CROWN PRINCE\'S VIEWS REFLECT A SAUDI RULER 
WHO MIGHT TAKE REFORM OF THE OLD REGIME SERIOUSLY, WHO 
LIKELY ENDORSES THE SAG\'S LESS RESPONSIVE STANCE TO U.S. 
REQUESTS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR FOREIGN POLICY 
INITIATIVES AND COMMERCIAL DEALS, BUT WHO MAY BE MORE IN 
TUNE WITH THE SAUDI POPULACE.  AN IMPORTANT CAVEAT, 
HOWEVER, IS THAT IT IS A LOT EASIER TO ESPOUSE REFORM, 
THAN IT IS TO ACHIEVE IT, PARTICULARLY IN A POLITICAL 
SYSTEM BASED ON FAMILY CONSENSUS AND COMPROMISE.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
4.  (C)  IN THE LAST WEEK, TWO FORMER AMBASSADORS TO 
SAUDI ARABIA, RICHARD MURPHY AND CHAS FREEMAN, VISITED 
RIYADH AND SEPARATELY RELATED TO THE AMBASSADOR AND POL 
COUNSELOR THEIR IMPRESSIONS OF THE POST-GULF WAR SAUDI 
POLITICAL ORDER, BASED ON MEETINGS WITH THE CROWN 
PRINCE, MORE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF THE AL SAUD, AND MERCHANT 
FAMILIES IN RIYADH AND JEDDAH.  MURPHY IS A FREQUENT 
TRAVELLER TO SAUDI ARABIA (THIS TRIP WAS UNDER THE 
AUSPICES OF THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS), WHILE 
FREEMAN\'S VISIT WAS HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO CALL UPON 
THE CROWN PRINCE SINCE HIS DEPARTURE IN AUGUST 1992. 
 
------------------ 
ABDULLAH ASCENDANT 
------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  FREEMAN DESCRIBED A RELAXED, YOUNGER-LOOKING, 
AND MORE CONFIDENT CROWN PRINCE WHO, IN THE COURSE OF 
THE HOUR LONG MEETING, DID NOT ONCE STUTTER.  DESPITE 
HIS IMPLICIT ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE CURRENT POLITICAL 
ARRANGEMENT -- WITH THE KING TECHNICALLY BACK IN CHARGE 
BUT, FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, ISOLATED IN JEDDAH -- 
IS AWKWARD, ABDULLAH EXUDED SELF-CONFIDENCE AND GREATER 
AUTHORITY. 
 
6.  (C)  MURPHY TOO COMMENTED ON ABDULLAH\'S UNUSUALLY 
RELAXED AND RELATIVELY LOQUACIOUS STYLE AND SECONDED 
FREEMAN\'S IMPRESSION THAT THE CROWN PRINCE IS ENJOYING 
HIS EXPANDED RESPONSIBILITIES.  MURPHY RELATED THAT 
WHILE ABDULLAH SIMPLY STATED THAT FAHD IS \"FINE,\" A 
CLOSE ARAB FRIEND OF THE KING\'S HAD TOLD HIM THAT DURING 
A RECENT PHONE CONVERSATION WITH FAHD, THE KING FALTERED 
AND THEN WAS HEARD ASKING SOMEONE \"WHO AM I SPEAKING 
WITH?\"  FREEMAN\'S REQUEST TO MEET WITH THE KING WAS MET 
WITH SILENCE BY ROYAL PROTOCOL. 
 
7.  (C)  BOTH FORMER AMBASSADORS WERE TOLD BY FAMILIES 
WHO ENJOY BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AL SAUD THAT 
FAHD\'S BROTHERS ARE CONCERNED THAT HE MAY BE TAKEN 
ADVANTAGE OF BY HIS AVARICIOUS IN-LAWS, THE 
AL-IBRAHIMS.  JEDDAH MERCHANT FAMILIES BELIEVE RIYADH 
GOVERNOR PRINCE SALMAN\'S CONTINUED PRESENCE IN JEDDAH BY 
THE KING\'S SIDE IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO FEND OFF EFFORTS 
BY AL-JAWHARA (THE KING\'S FAVORITE WIFE), HER SON ABD 
AL-AZIZ (THE KING\'S FAVORITE SON), AND HER BROTHERS, THE 
AL-IBRAHIMS, TO SECURE A GREATER PORTION OF THE KING\'S 
ASSETS.  ACCORDING TO THESE REPORTS, AL-JAWHARA AND ABD 
AL-AZIZ ARE UNEASY WITH THE GRADUAL CEDING OF POLITICAL 
AUTHORITY TO THE CROWN PRINCE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
PICKING UP THE TAB: THE UNPLEASANT GULF WAR MEMORY 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8.  (C)  ABDULLAH TOOK BOTH MEN TO TASK FOR WHAT HE 
JUDGED TO BE THE UNFAIR FINANCIAL BURDEN PLACED ON THE 
SAUDI ECONOMY BY THE U.S. DURING DESERT SHIELD/STORM. 
REFERRING TO JIM BAKER\'S MEMOIRES, THE CROWN PRINCE TOLD 
FREEMAN HE APPRECIATED HIS EFFORTS DURING THE WAR TO 
CONVINCE THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE TO MODERATE HIS 
FINANCIAL DEMANDS.  IN CONTRAST TO THE EMOTIONAL TRIBUTE 
ABDULLAH PAID TO THE U.S. FORCES SIX MONTHS AFTER THE 
WAR, IN THIS MOST RECENT MEETING WITH MURPHY THE CROWN 
PRINCE SPONTANEOUSLY REMARKED, \"WE SPENT FAR TOO MUCH ON 
THE GULF WAR,\" AND QUERIED \"WHY DID YOU GET US TO SPEND 
SO MUCH?\"  IN RESPONSE, MURPHY STATED THAT AT THE TIME 
WE WERE CONCERNED OVER ENGAGING THE FOURTH LARGEST ARMY 
IN THE WORLD AND THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE ON IRAQ WAS 
ALWAYS WEAK.  ABDULLAH SNAPPED IN RESPONSE, \"WHERE WAS 
THE CIA, SLEEPING?...IS IT ANY BETTER NOW?\"  THE CROWN 
PRINCE CONCLUDED BY NOTING, \"WELL, THE MONEY IS GONE, 
SPENT.\" 
 
9.  (C)  AMONG THE PRIVATE SECTOR, REACTION TO THE 
FINANCIAL AFTER-SHOCKS OF THE GULF WAR IS \"VIOLENT,\" 
ACCORDING TO FREEMAN.  WHILE CAREFUL TO COUPLE THEIR 
CRITICISMS WITH APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. MILITARY 
RESPONSE, SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TOLD FREEMAN THAT THE U.S. 
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AN ALLY IN A TIME OF CRISIS. 
FURTHERMORE, FREEMAN WAS LECTURED, THE PROMOTION OF 
LARGE COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS AFTER THE WAR, SUCH AS THE 
BOEING AIRPLANE DEAL, FURTHER REDUCES THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
ABILITY TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS DOMESTIC ARREARS.  BASED ON 
HIS MEETINGS WITH THE MAJOR MERCHANT FAMILIES, FREEMAN 
HAZARDED THAT THE SAG OWES BETWEEN 12-15 BILLION USD IN 
ARREARS.  (NOTE:  EMBASSY ESTIMATES PLACE ARREARS AT 
10-13 BILLION USD.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
ABDULLAH\'S PLATFORM: UNITED BUDGET, LESS CORRUPTION 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
10.  (C)  ABDULLAH INDICATED TO FREEMAN THAT HE WAS 
PREPARED TO TACKLE SAUDI ARABIA\'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES 
HEAD-ON.  NOTING THAT MORE ECONOMIC BELT-TIGHTENING 
WOULD HAVE TO BE IMPOSED, THE CROWN PRINCE AGREED THAT 
SOME MEASURE OF AUSTERITY MIGHT PROVIDE A VALUABLE 
LESSON FOR SAUDI YOUTH, WHO, ABDULLAH BELIEVES, HAVE 
BECOME TOO SOFT DURING THE BOOM YEARS. 
 
11.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO LEADING QUESTIONS FROM 
FREEMAN,  THE CROWN PRINCE OPAQUELY COMMENTED ON THE 
NEED TO \"UNIFY\" THE SAUDI BUDGET, WHICH FREEMAN READ TO 
MEAN INCORPORATING INTO THE BUDGET THE OFF-BUDGET 
EXPENDITURES RELATED O THE \"RECONSTRUCTION\" OF THE TWO 
HOLY MOSQUES IN MECCA AND MEDINA, THE SAG-UK AL-YAMAMAH 
WEAPONS PROGRAM, AND THE STRATEGIC STORAGE PROJECT. 
(NOTE: IT IS FROM THESE PROJECTS, WHOSE ESTIMATED 12 
BILLION USD BUDGETS SIDESTEP THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE, 
THAT THE KING AND MINDEF SULTAN ARE BELIEVED TO DIVERT 
GREAT SUMS INTO THEIR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS OR TO COMPANIES 
IN WHICH ROYAL FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE AN INTEREST.)  THE 
CROWN PRINCE NOTED IN GENERAL TERMS THAT SUCH A TASK 
WOULD NOT BE EASY. 
 
12.  (C)  A FURTHER INDICATION THAT THE CROWN PRINCE 
WILL EMBRACE AN ANTI-CORRUPTION DRIVE AS PART OF HIS 
POLITICAL AGENDA, FREEMAN CONTINUED, IS THE TIGHT 
SURVEILLANCE THAT ABDULLAH KEEPS HIS SONS UNDER WHEN IT 
COMES TO PRIVATE BUSINESS DEALS.  (COMMENT: 
NEVERTHELESS, WE ARE AWARE THAT ABDULLAH\'S PROGENY, SUCH 
AS DEPUTY SANG COMMANDER PRINCE MITIB, ARE NOT LACKING 
IN AVARICE.) 
 
--------------------------- 
ABDULLAH ON ISRAEL AND IRAN 
--------------------------- 
 
13.  (C)  COMING ON THE HEELS OF A TELEPHONE 
CONVERSATION WITH EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MUBARAK, THE CROWN 
PRINCE QUESTIONED MURPHY CLOSELY ABOUT LIBYAN CHEMICAL 
CAPABILITIES.  ABDULLAH, MURPHY NOTED, REMARKED THAT THE 
U.S. HAS MADE AGAIN ACCUSATIONS OF A COVERT WEAPONS 
PROGRAM AGAINST LIBYA AND PAKISTAN, YET HAS SAID NOTHING 
ABOUT ISRAEL\'S NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.  ABDULLAH EMPHASIZED 
THAT ARAFAT CANNOT ACCEPT ANY SETTLEMENT WHICH IS UNJUST 
AND STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT BEING 
METED OUT BY ISRAEL AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS.  MURPHY 
URGED ABDULLAH NOT TO EXAGGERATE THE HUMANITARIAN 
DIMENSION, WHICH CAN BE REMEDIED QUICKLY, BUT FOCUS ON 
WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SHORE UP THE POLITICAL WILL OF BOTH 
PERES AND ARAFAT TO MOVE THE PEACE PROCESS FORWARD. 
 
14.  (C)  REPEATING COMMENTS WHICH HE FIRST MADE TO 
MURPHY IN NOVEMBER 1995, THE CROWN PRINCE URGED THE 
UNITED STATES TO FIND AN ARENA IN WHICH TO ENGAGE IRAN, 
ESSENTIALLY ENDORSING THE EUROPEAN UNION\'S POLICY OF 
CRITICAL DIALOGUE.  ABDULLAH CHARACTERIZED THE TRADE 
EMBARGO AS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE U.S.\'S LONG-TERM 
INTERESTS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
15.  (C)  ABDULLAH\'S REMARKS, AS REPORTED BY THE TWO 
AMBASSADORS, REFLECT A RULER WHO TAKES ECONOMIC REFORM 
SERIOUSLY; WHO, AS KING, LIKELY WILL SHARPEN THE PATTERN 
OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS UNDER FAHD\'S TENURE OF 
DECLINING RECEPTIVITY TO APPEALS BY THE USG FOR DONOR 
AID TO SUPPORT FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES; BUT WHO IS 
MORE IN TUNE, ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY, WITH HIS 
SUBJECTS.  WHILE FREEMAN DESCRIBED HIS CONVERSATION WITH 
ABDULLAH ON ECONOMIC REFORM AS PART KABUKI THEATER, HE 
LEFT THE MEETING CONVINCED (AS ABDULLAH\'S RIGHT HAND 
MAN, SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ AL-TUWAIJRI, HAS OFTEN TRIED TO 
CONVINCE US - REFTELS) THAT ABDULLAH IS SERIOUS ABOUT 
REFORMING BOTH THE SAUDI ECONOMY AND THE ROYAL FAMILY. 
 
16.  (C)  IF HE WERE TO SUCCEED IN \"UNIFYING\" THE 
BUDGET, WHICH HAS LONG BEEN THE GOAL OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S 
TECHNOCRATS, ABDULLAH WOULD REMOVE FROM THE 
DISCRETIONARY SPHERE THE FUNDS WITH WHICH THE AL FAHD 
HAVE USED TO SUPPORT THEIR LAVISH LIFESTYLE, AS WELL AS 
DISTRIBUTING TO THEIR SUPPORTERS.  ABDULLAH\'S STATEMENTS 
MAY REFLECT HIS OWN FRUSTRATION AT HAVING THE KINGDOM\'S 
DISCRETIONARY FUNDS TIED UP IN OFF-BUDGET, AL 
FAHD-CONTROLLED, PROJECTS.  NEVERTHELESS, IT IS EASIER 
TO ENDORSE REFORM AS A CROWN PRINCE, THAN IT IS TO 
EFFECT IT AS A KING.  REGARDLESS OF ABDULLAH\'S 
CREDENTIALS AS A REFORMER, HIS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
AGENDA WILL REQUIRE HIS ACHIEVING A FAMILY CONSENSUS 
THAT WOULD LIKELY INVOLVE COMPROMISES WITH THE VERY 
PRINCES WHOSE LIVELIHOOD HIS REFORMS WOULD THREATEN.

1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CDA THEODORE KATTOUF, REASON 1.5.D. 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY:  GIVEN KING FAHD\'S UNCERTAIN HEALTH, 
CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH APPEARS TO HAVE MOVED INTO THE 
ROLE OF REPRESENTING SAUDI ARABIA\'S FACE TO THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD.  WHILE DRAMATIC CHANGES ARE NOT THE HALLMARK OF 
SAUDI GOVERNANCE, ABDULLAH WILL NO DOUBT PUT HIS OWN 
IMPRIMATUR ON SAUDI DIPLOMACY.  HE IS, FOR EXAMPLE, 
ATTUNED TO LOCAL POLITICS AND WILL VIEW SAG\'S OVERSEAS 
COMMITMENTS FROM THE OPTIC OF THE EFFECT THAY WILL HAVE 
ON DOMESTIC PRIORITIES.  ALTHOUGH THE CROWN PRINCE HAS 
REPEATEDLY STRESSED HIS COMMITMENT TO CLOSE BILATERAL 
TIES WITH THE U.S., HE HAS SPOKEN FORCEFULLY OF THE NEED 
FOR A JUST PEACE FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND SYRIANS.  WE 
EXPECT ABDULLAH TO BE ACTIVE IN SHAPING AN ARAB 
CONSENSUS THAT KEEPS THE PEACE PROCESS ALIVE, WHILE 
MAINTAINING THE APPEARANCE OF ARAB UNITY AND RESOLVE. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
ABDULLAH\'S DIPLOMATIC PROFILE 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, LED THE 
SAUDI DELEGATION TO THE JUNE 7-8 TRIPARTITE SUMMIT IN 
DAMASCUS.  ABDULLAH WILL REPRESENT SAUDI ARABIA AT THE 
JUNE 22 SUMMIT IN CAIRO AND PERHAPS ALL FUTURE ARAB 
SUMMITRY. 
 
4.  (C) ALTHOUGH IT IS CLEAR THAT HE STILL MUST BE 
CONSULTED ON KEY DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY ON FOREIGN 
POLICY MATTERS, KING FAHD\'S INVOLVEMENT IN DAY-TO-DAY 
AFFAIRS OF STATE REMAINS SPORADIC.  RECENTLY, THE KING 
RECEIVED SULTAN QABUS, AND THE KUWAITI AND BAHRAINI 
FOREIGN MINISTERS IN JEDDAH.  HE ALSO MET IN MECCA THE 
HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENTS LEADING THEIR HAJJ 
DELEGATIONS.  EVEN EARLIER IN THE YEAR, HE HAD A SHORT 
MEETING WITH FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH.  THE MEDIA REPORT 
THE KING PRESIDING OVER MEETINGS OF THE COUNCIL OF 
MINISTERS THAT ISSUE STATEMENTS SPELLING OUT THE SAG\'S 
POSITION ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES.  NEVERTHELESS, ALL 
AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATS THAT THESE ENCOUNTERS ARE 
TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AFAIRS AND LARGELY PROTOCOLARY IN 
CHARACTER. 
 
5.  (C) WHILE EFFORTS PERSIST TO FUDGE THE ISSUE OF THE 
KING\'S PRESENCE AT THE HELM OF STATE, THE CURRENT RUSH 
OF ARAB AND PEACE PROCESS POLITICS IS INCREASINGLY 
FORCING THE AL SAUD TO PERMIT THE HEIR APPARENT TO 
PROJECT THEIR TOP LEADERSHIP.  INDEED, ABDULLAH HAS 
STEPPED IN WHERE A SUBSTANTIVE OFFICIAL SAUDI PRESENCE 
IS REQUIRED.  THUS, THE CROWN PRINCE ATTENDED THE GCC 
SUMMIT IN MUSCAT LAST DECEMBER AND THE RECENT DAMASCUS 
TRIPARTITE SUMMIT.  ON THE OTHER HAND, FOREIGN MINISTER 
PRINCE SAUD AL-FAYSAL REPRESENTED THE SAG AT AN EARLIER 
SYRIA-EGYPT-SAUDI ARABIA SUMMIT IN EGYPT, ALSO IN 
DECEMBER, AND AT THE SHARM AL-SHAYKH ANTI-TERRORISM 
SUMMIT (ILLUSTRATING THE KING\'S CONTINUED POLICY 
ENGAGEMENT, FAHD REPORTEDLY OVERRULED ABDULLAH AND 
SULTAN\'S RELUCTANCE TO ATTEND THE SUMMIT, INSISTING THAT 
THE SAG BE REPRESENTED). 
 
------------------------------------------- 
BURNISHING CREDENTIALS:  AT HOME AND ABROAD 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) AT HOME, ABDULLAH IS NOW MEETING VIRTUALLY ALL 
HIGH-LEVEL FOREIGN VISITORS TO SAUDI ARABIA (USUALLY ONE 
A DAY AND OFTEN SEVERAL MORE) AND IS CONDUCTING 
WIDELY-PUBLICIZED AND QUITE INTENSE TELEPHONE DIPLOMACY 
WITH ARAB AND OTHER FOREIGN LEADERS.  BY CONTRAST, 
MINDEF SULTAN - LONG CONSIDERED BY FOREIGN PUNDITS AS A 
RIVAL TO ABDULLAH WHO WOULD INTRUDE ON THE CROWN 
PRINCE\'S SPACE - IS MUCH LESS VISIBLE AND CLEARLY 
SECONDARY IN THESE FOREIGN CONTACTS.  ALL THIS HAS 
CERTAINLY HELPED BURNISH THE CROWN PRINCE\'S DOMESTIC AND 
INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS AND HELPED RAISE HIS RATHER 
LOW PROFILE IN THE DIPLOMATIC ARENA STEMMING FROM FAHD\'S 
PREVIOUSLY JEALOUS OVERSIGHT OF FOREIGN POLICY, NOT TO 
MENTION THE CROWN PRINCE\'S RETICENCE STEMMING FROM A 
SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. 
 
7.  (C) ABDULLAH\'S ACTIVISM ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE 
PERMITS HIM TO PROJECT HIMSELF AS A DE FACTO HEAD OF 
STATE -- A ROLE IN WHICH HE APPEARS TO BE INCREASINGLY 
COMFORTABLE.  ABDULLAH WAS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN 
DAMASCUS AND, BY SAUDI ACCOUNT, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN 
ENSURING THAT IRAQ NOT BE INVITED TO THE CAIRO SUMMIT. 
OTHER MEETINGS, SUCH AS THE CAIRO SUMMIT, WILL LIKELY 
FURTHER BOOST THE CROWN PRINCE\'S STATURE.  IN SHORT, 
DOMESTICALLY, THE SAUDIS ARE GETTING USED TO SEEING 
ABDULLAH IN CHARGE.  ARAB LEADERS ARE LEARNING TO DO THE 
SAME. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
THE INNER CIRCLE:  CONFLICTING ADVICE AND FRUSTRATION 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
8.  (C) AS ABDULLAH BURNISHES HIS CREDENTIALS HERE AND 
ABROAD, WE ARE TOLD THERE IS RISING IMPATIENCE WITHIN 
HIS INNER CIRCLE THAT THE CROWN PRINCE ASSERT HIMSELF 
MORE WITH REGARD TO THE KING; THAT IS, THAT ABDULLAH 
TAKE A MORE VOCAL POSITION ON KEY ISSUES WHICH ARE 
BEFORE THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP.  THIS VIEW, REPORTEDLY 
HELD BY YOUNGER MEMBERS OF ABDULLAH\'S FAMILY, HAS BEEN 
COUNTERED BY THE APPROACH OF SENIOR ADVISORS -- 
PRINCIPALLY SHAYKH ABD AL-AZIZ AL-TUWAYJRI -- WHO 
COUNSEL PATIENCE AND RESTRAINT.  TO DATE ABDULLAH HAS 
EMBRACED THE LATTER VIEW, PERHAPS COGNIZANT THAT LITTLE 
WOULD BE GAINED, AND MUCH COULD BE LOST, BY PUSHING THE 
LIMITS OF EXISTING LINES OF AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY 
WITH A KING WHO HAS NEVER BEEN RETICENT TO EXERCISE 
POWER, AND WHO COULD THEORETICALLY, AT LEAST, REMOVE 
ABDULLAH AS HEIR APPARENT. 
 
9.  (C) THE SHIFTING LINES OF AUTHORITY, AND UNCERTAINTY 
OVER WHETHER AND WHEN THE KING WILL WEIGH IN ON MATTERS, 
HAS GENERATED FRUSTRATION AMONG THE CROWN PRINCE\'S 
CLOSEST SUPPORTERS.  A FORMER U.S. MILITARY ADVISOR TO 
THE SANG AND CLOSE FRIEND OF SHAYKH TUWAYJRI FOR OVER 
TWENTY YEARS DESCRIBES TUWAYJRI AS \"DEPRESSED\" OVER THE 
CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS WITHIN THE HIGHEST COUNCILS OF 
THE RULING FAMILY.  TUWAYJRI REPORTEDLY HAS HAD TO 
SUFFER BROADSIDES FROM YOUNGER ABDULLAH FAMILY MEMBERS 
WHO CHARGE THAT TUWAYJRI IS OLD, OUT OF TOUCH, AND NO 
LONGER DISPENSES SOUND ADVICE TO THE CROWN PRINCE. 
TUWAYJRI\'S VISIBLE PRESENCE AT THE TRIPARTITE SUMMIT IN 
DAMASCUS, AND HIS RECENT REGIONAL TRAVELS ON BEHALF OF 
ABDULLAH, TO SYRIA AND MOROCCO, HOWEVER, REAFFIRM THAT 
ABDULLAH HAS NOT ABANDONED HIS LONG-STANDING 
CONFIDANTE.  INDEED, TUWAYJRI WILL ACCOMPANY HIM TO 
CAIRO ON JUNE 21. 
 
------------------------- 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S. 
------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) WHILE ABDULLAH WILL QUIETLY BEGIN TO PUT HIS 
OWN IMPRIMATUR ON SAUDI DIPLOMACY, WE WILL ALSO BE 
WATCHING TO SEE IF AND HOW THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING ON 
ABDULLAH -- MORE ATTUNED TO SYRIAN AND ARAB CONCERNS -- 
IS TRANSLATED INTO ANY SPECIFIC AGENDA.  IN ADDITION TO 
ARAB AND BROADER MUSLIM INTERESTS, AS WE HAVE REPORTED 
BEFORE (RIYADH 29), ABDULLAH IS ATTUNED TO THE DOMESTIC 
POLITICS OF SAUDI ARABIA, ITS SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, AND 
THE AFFECT THAT THE SAG\'S OVERSEAS COMMITMENTS WILL HAVE 
ON DOMESTIC PRIORITIES OR ON THE VERY CONSERVATIVE SAUDI 
POPULACE.  THAT SAID, CHANGE IS NOT A HALLMARK OF SAUDI 
GOVERNANCE AND ABDULLAH, WHO HAS BEEN FAITHFULLY 
DEFERENTIAL TO FAHD, HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION THAT HE IS 
SEEKING ANY DRAMATIC REVERSAL OF CURRENT POLICIES. 
 
11.  (C) THE CROWN PRINCE HAS REPEATEDLY AND 
EMPHATICALLY STRESSED HIS PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO A 
STRONG U.S.-SAUDI BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AND APPEARS 
ANXIOUS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE WILL KEEP U.S. POLICY 
INTERESTS FIRMLY IN VIEW.  WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE. 
AT THE SAME TIME, ABDULLAH HAS SPOKEN FORCEFULLY ABOUT 
ARAB RIGHTS AND FEAR THAT A STALEMATE IN THE PEACE 
PROCESS WILL ONLY SPAWN THE POPULARITY OF EXTREMISTS. 
HE BELIEVES THAT IT PROFITS THE AL SAUD AND THE U.S. 
LITTLE, IF BY ACCEDING TO U.S. WISHES, THE RULING FAMILY 
ALIENATES KEY DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCIES.  UNDER ABDULLAH\'S 
INCREASING INFLUENCE, WE EXPECT THE SAG TO ADHERE 
CLOSELY TO THE ARAB CONSENSUS, INCLUDING:  ESTABLISHMENT 
OF A JUST AND LASTING PEACE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF 
LAND FOR PEACE.  ABDULLAH HAS REPEATEDLY STRESSED HIS 
PERSONAL BOTTOM LINE FOR THE PEACE PROCESS -- 
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON THE STATUS OF JERUSALEM. 
 
12.  (C) OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO THE U.S. IS WHETHER 
ABDULLAH WILL SEEK TO PLAY A MORE FORCEFUL AND ACTIVIST 
ROLE IN ARAB COUNCILS THAN HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE 
CASE FOR THE SAG.  ABDULLAH\'S LONGSTANDING TIES TO ASAD 
MAY GIVE HIM A SPECIAL INFUENCE WITH THE SYRIANS, BUT 
THE REVERSE IS MORE LIKELY TO PROVE TRUE.   HIS FORCEFUL 
LINE ON IRAQI PARTICIPATION AT THE CAIRO SUMMIT IS 
PERHAPS A HARBINGER OF GREATER EFFORTS TO SHAPE ARAB 
POSITIONS RATHER THAN REACT TO THEM. 
 
13.  (C) SEE RIYADH 29 (NOTAL) FOR MORE BIOGRAPHIC 
INFORMATION ON CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH.

3.  (C)  DEFYING THE PREDICTIONS OF SOME WITHIN HIS 
MEDICAL ENTOURAGE, THE KING IS ENJOYING A MEDICAL AND 
POLITICAL COMEBACK.  DATING FROM HIS JUNE 8 RECEPTION OF 
OMAN\'S SULTAN QABOOS, FAHD\'S PUBLIC APPEARANCES HAVE 
GROWN IN NUMBER AND IN CONSEQUENCE.  MORE OFTEN THAN 
NOT, FAHD IS CHAIRING THE WEEKLY COUNCIL OF MINISTERS 
MEETING AND HIS RECEPTION OF FOREIGN V.I.P.\'S HAS 
EVOLVED FROM PERFUNCTORY \"DROP-BY\'S\" TO ENGAGEMENTS OF 
POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE.  THE KING\'S LEVEL OF ACTIVITY 
SUGGESTS THAT THERE WILL BE NO IMMINENT RESUMPTION OF 
THE CROWN PRINCE\'S REGENCY.  HOWEVER, RECENT WESTERN 
VISITORS HAVE DRAWN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT 
THE KING\'S MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES. 
 
------------------------------- 
RIFKIND ON FAHD: ONE TRACK MIND 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  THE BRITISH READ-OUT ON FAHD\'S HEALTH, 
FOLLOWING FOREIGN MINISTER RIFKIND\'S JULY 1 MEETING WITH 
THE KING (REFTEL), CLOSELY PARALLELS OUR ASSESSMENT OF 
FAHD DURING SECDEF PERRY\'S JUNE 29 VISIT.  CAPABLE OF 
GOING BEYOND PROTOCOL AND OF HANDLING A FOCUSED 
SUBSTANTIVE EXCHANGE, FAHD IS NEVERTHELESS NOTICEABLY 
MORE FREQUENTLY REPETITIVE AND \"LESS SHARP.\"  U.K. 
AMBASSADOR ANDREW GREEN RELATED TO CHARGE THAT, IN 
RESPONSE TO A QUESTION POSED BY RIFKIND, FAHD WAS UNABLE 
TO SHIFT GEARS AND ADDRESS A TOPIC UNRELATED TO HIS 
PRIMARY AGENDA.  IN THE AWKWARD PAUSE WHICH ENSUED, THE 
DELEGATION WAS QUICKLY SUMMONED TO A DINNER HOSTED BY 
FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD AL-FAYSAL.  THE KING APPEARED TO 
THE BRITISH OBSERVERS TO BE IN REASONABLY GOOD PHYSICAL 
CONDITION, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
FRENCH TAKE: MENTALLY ENGAGED, PHYSICALLY DIMINISHED 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5.  (C)  ACCORDING TO FRENCH EMBASSY COUNSELOR PAUL 
ORTHOLAN, CHIRAC AND HIS DELEGATION WERE SURPRISED BY 
THE KING\'S LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION THROUGHOUT THE JULY 
6-8 VISIT.  FAHD WAS PRESENT AT THE AIRPORT, STANDING ON 
THE TARMAC IN THE STIFLING JEDDAH HEAT AS CHIRAC\'S PLANE 
LANDED.  WHILE THE ARRIVAL CEREMONY WAS TRUNCATED (E.G., 
NO NATIONAL ANTHEMS) IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE KING\'S TIME 
ON HIS FEET AND HIS EXPOSURE TO THE HEAT, FAHD DROVE 
WITH CHIRAC TO THE GUEST PALACE AND LATER IN THE EVENING 
HOSTED A DINNER, FOLLOWED BY A 90 MINUTE BILATERAL WHICH 
INCLUDED A 15 MINUTE TETE-A-TETE BETWEEN FAHD AND THE 
FRENCH PRESIDENT.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF CHIRAC\'S VISIT, 
FAHD DROVE WITH CHIRAC TO THE AIRPORT AND SAW HIM OFF. 
 
6.  (C)  WHILE THE KING REPEATED HIMSELF FREQUENTLY IN 
HIS DINNER AND BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS, CHIRAC AND HIS 
PARTY VIEWED THIS MORE AS AN ARAB MANNERISM, THAN A 
MANIFESTATION OF HIS NOVEMBER 1995 STROKE.  ORTHALON 
NOTED THAT THE EXCHANGES FOCUSED ON THE PEACE PROCESS, 
WITH LONG KINGLY DIGRESSIONS INTO PRIOR SAG INITIATIVES 
TO PROMOTE PEACE IN THE REGION, BUT THAT WITHIN THIS 
CONVERSATIONAL ORBIT, FAHD WAS FULLY ABREAST OF THE 
CAIRO SUMMIT, THE G-7 LYON STATEMENT, AND THE EU 
FLORENCE COMMUNIQUE.  ON THE WHOLE, ORTHALON REPORTED, 
KING FAHD APPEARED IN BETTER MENTAL SHAPE THAN THEY HAD 
BEEN LED TO BELIEVE. 
 
7.  (C)  HOWEVER, ORTHALON EMPHASIZED, CHIRAC WAS STRUCK 
BY THE KING\'S PHYSICAL DETERIORATION.  (NOTE: CHIRAC IS 
THE FIRST WESTERN OBSERVER TO HAVE VIEWED THE KING IN 
ACTION OVER A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME.  TYPICALLY THE 
KING HAS GREETED VISITORS STANDING IN A RECEPTION HALL, 
BUT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN OR TELEVISED WALKING.)  FAHD 
APPEARED TO BE ALMOST CRIPPLED, ORTHALON REPORTED, AND 
WALKED WITH \"TREMENDOUS\" DIFFICULTY, HUNCHED OVER, USING 
A CANE, AND SUPPORTED ON EITHER SIDE BY AN AIDE.  AT THE 
END OF THE DINNER, FAHD REQUIRED ASSISTANCE IN STANDING 
UP.  FOLLOWING THE 90 MINUTE BILATERAL, THE KING WAS 
UNABLE TO RISE AND CHIRAC LENT A HAND IN ASSISTING FAHD 
TO A WHEELCHAIR.  THE FRENCH DELEGATION DID NOT KNOW 
WHAT TO MAKE OF FAHD\'S DARK SUNGLASSES, WHICH HE WORE 
THROUGHOUT THE DINNER AND SUBSEQUENT MEETING. 
 
--------------------------- 
COMMENT: A REIGNING MONARCH 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  FAHD\'S APPARENT RECOVERY IS SUFFICIENT TO QUELL 
DOUBTS AS TO HIS ABILITY TO REIGN.  HIS CAPACITY TO 
RULE, HOWEVER, APPEARS TRUNCATED.  REDUCED STAMINA, 
IMPAIRED MENTAL AGILITY, AND IMMOBILITY WILL DELIMIT 
FAHD\'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS OF STATE. 
THUS, WHILE THE KING APPEARS TO HAVE RECOVERED 
SUBSTANTIALLY FROM HIS STROKE LAST NOVEMBER, IT IS ALSO 
CLEARQ, HE QIKELY TO COMPLETELY REGAIN HIS 
EARLIER FORM EITHER MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY. 
CONSEQUENTLY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE CROWN PRINCE AND 
MINDEF SULTAN WILL CONTINUE TO FILL THE WIDE GAPS LEFT 
BY THE KING\'S REDUCED ABILITY TO MANAGE SAUDI DECISION- 
MAKING.

SUBJECT:  SAUDI ROYAL WEALTH:  WHERE DO THEY GET ALL THAT MONEY? 
 
1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY ACTING DCM ALBERT THIBAULT.  REASON: 1.5 
(B).  THIS MESSAGE FULFILLS A POST REPORTING PLAN REQUIREMENT. 
 
------------------------ 
SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION 
------------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  SAUDI PRINCES AND PRINCESSES, OF WHOM THERE ARE THOUSANDS, 
ARE KNOWN FOR THE STORIES OF THEIR FABULOUS WEALTH--AND TENDENCY TO 
SQUANDER IT.  THIS CABLE EXAMINES THE MECHANISMS, NOT COUNTING 
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, THROUGH WHICH SAUDI ROYALS OBTAIN THEIR MONEY. 
THESE MECHANISMS OFTEN PROVIDE THE SEED MONEY FOR ROYALS TO LAUNCH 
LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VENTURES.  A SUBSEQUENT CABLE WILL 
EXAMINE THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF SAUDI ROYALS. 
 
3.  (S)  THE MOST COMMON MECHANISM FOR DISTRIBUTING THE NATION\'S 
WEALTH TO THE ROYAL FAMILY IS THE FORMAL, BUDGETED SYSTEM OF 
MONTHLY STIPENDS FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE AL SAUD, MANAGED BY THE 
MINISTRY OF FINANCE\'S \"OFFICE OF DECISIONS AND RULES.\"  THE 
STIPENDS RANGE FROM $270,000 PER MONTH ON THE HIGH END TO $800 PER 
MONTH FOR THE LOWLIEST MEMBER OF THE MOST REMOTE BRANCH OF THE 
FAMILY.  BONUS PAYMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR MARRIAGE AND PALACE 
BUILDING.  THE EMBASSY ESTIMATES THAT THE STIPENDS SYSTEM PUTS AN 
ANNUAL DRAIN OF ABOUT $2 BILLION ON THE $40 BILLION GOVERNMENT 
BUDGET. 
 
4.  (S)  ASIDE FROM THE STIPENDS SYSTEM, A HANDFUL OF THE 
SENIORMOST PRINCES ENRICH THEMSELVES BY CONTROLLING SEVERAL BILLION 
DOLLARS IN ANNUAL EXPENDITURES IN \"OFF-BUDGET\" PROGRAMS.  WITH NO 
MINISTRY OF FINANCE OVERSIGHT OR CONTROLS, THESE PROGRAMS ARE 
WIDELY VIEWED AS SOURCES OF ROYAL RAKEOFFS.  AS CHARACTERIZED BY 
BILLIONAIRE PRINCE AL-WALID BIN TALAL (STRICTLY PROTECT) TO THE 
AMBASSADOR, THROUGH THESE OFF-BUDGET PROGRAMS, FIVE OR SIX PRINCES 
CONTROL THE REVENUES FROM ONE MILLION BARRELS PER DAY (B/D) OF THE 
KINGDOM\'S EIGHT MILLION B/D OF CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION. 
 
5.  (S) OTHER WAYS SOME PRINCES OBTAIN MONEY INCLUDE BORROWING FROM 
THE BANKS, AND NOT PAYING THEM BACK.  WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION 
OF NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK (NCB), WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN VIEWED 
HERE AS THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S BANK, SAUDI BANKS GENERALLY TURN ROYALS 
AWAY UNLESS THEY HAVE A PROVEN REPAYMENT TRACK RECORD.  PRINCES 
ALSO USE THEIR CLOUT TO CONFISCATE LAND FROM COMMONERS, ESPECIALLY 
IF IT IS KNOWN TO BE THE SITE FOR AN UPCOMING PROJECT AND CAN BE 
QUICKLY RESOLD TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR A PROFIT.  ANOTHER COMMON 
MONEYMAKING SCHEME IS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRINCES TO \"SPONSOR\" SOMETIMES 
HUNDREDS OF EXPATRIATE WORKERS WHO ARE UNLEASHED TO FREELANCE ON 
THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND IN RETURN PAY THEIR ROYAL SPONSOR A SMALL 
MONTHLY FEE, USUALLY AROUND $100. 
 
6.  (S)  IN THE END, ROYALS STILL SEEM MORE ADEPT AT SQUANDERING 
THAN ACCUMULATING WEALTH.  DESPITE THE HANDOUTS, THERE ARE MORE 
COMMONER BILLIONAIRES THAN ROYAL BILLIONAIRES IN THE KINGDOM.  THE 
WEALTHIEST ROYALS AND THEIR PERSONAL FORTUNES BY OUR ESTIMATES ARE: 
AL-WALID BIN TALAL BIN ABD AL-AZIZ -- $13 BILLION, KING FAHD -- $10 
BILLION, DEFENSE MINISTER PRINCE SULTAN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ -- $10 
BILLION, KHALID BIN SULTAN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ -- $2 BILLION. 
 
7.  (S)  ROYALTY HERE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE WEALTH AND THE TRAPPINGS 
OF POWER TO A CERTAIN DEGREE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IMPORTANT ROYAL FAMILY 
MEMBERS HOLD \'MAJLISES\' WHERE VISITORS WILL DISCUSS THEIR CONCERNS 
AND SEEK ROYAL INTERCESSION WITH AUTHORITIES.  CROWN PRINCE 
ABDULLAH\'S WEEKLY MAJLIS ATTRACTS MANY DOZENS TO HUNDREDS OF 
PETITIONERS MOST OF WHOM RECEIVE SOME GIFT OR ATTENTION TO THEIR 
PROBLEMS.   PRINCES CUSTOMARILY PROVIDE HOSPITALITY, TOO.  ONE 
FORMER EASTERN PROVINCE GOVERNOR, FAHD BIN SALMAN, CLAIMS THAT HE 
SPENDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SR 4 MILLION OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET ON 
LARGESSE AND FEASTS FOR COMMONERS DURING THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN. 
HOWEVER, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPROPRIATE ROYAL LARGESSE 
AND GREED.  MANY BELIEVE THAT ROYAL GREED HAS GONE BEYOND THE 
BOUNDS OF REASON, TO INCLUDE WIDESPREAD INTERLOPING ON THE BUSINESS 
COMMUNITY\'S TURF, TRADITIONALLY OFF LIMITS TO ROYALS.  (SEE SEPTEL 
EXAMINATION OF PRINCES IN BUSINESS.)  AS LONG AS THE ROYAL FAMILY 
VIEWS THIS COUNTRY AND ITS OIL WEALTH AS AL SAUD INC., THE 
THOUSANDS OF PRINCES AND PRINCESSES WILL SEE IT AS THEIR BIRTHRIGHT 
TO RECEIVE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND RAID THE TILL.  IT IS OUR VIEW 
THAT OF THE PRIORITY ISSUES THE COUNTRY FACES, GETTING A GRIP ON 
ROYAL FAMILY EXCESSES IS AT THE TOP.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
---------------------- 
THE SYSTEM OF STIPENDS 
---------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  EVERY PRINCE AND PRINCESS FROM BIRTH GETS A MONTHLY 
ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS PART OF THE STATE BUDGET AND DISTRIBUTED 
THROUGH AN OFFICE OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE CALLED THE \"OFFICE OF 
DECISIONS AND RULES\" (IDARAT AL-MUQARRARAT WA AL-QAWA\'ID).  ECONOFF 
RECENTLY PAID A COURTESY CALL ON THE OFFICE\'S DIRECTOR, ABD AL-AZIZ 
AL-SHUBAYLI.  THE OFFICE, IN AN OLD BUILDING IN WHAT PASSES AS 
RIYADH\'S BANKING DISTRICT, WAS BUSTLING WITH SERVANTS PICKING UP 
CASH FOR THEIR MASTERS.  AL-SHUBAYLI, WHO SPOKE NOT A WORD OF 
ENGLISH, HOSTED ECONOFF FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS IN AN OPEN-DOOR 
SESSION THAT WAS INCESSANTLY INTERRUPTED BY PETITIONERS.  BASED ON 
AL-SHUBAYLI\'S COMMENTS, ECONOFF\'S OBSERVATIONS AND COMMENTS BY A 
SAUDI FAMILIAR WITH THE ORGANIZATION, THE OFFICE APPEARS TO SERVE 
AT LEAST THREE FUNCTIONS: 
 
  -- DISTRIBUTION OF STIPENDS TO THE ROYAL FAMILY. 

  -- DISTRIBUTION OF STIPENDS TO OTHER FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS 
     GRANTED MONTHLY STIPENDS IN PERPETUITY.  EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE 
     AL AL-SHAYKH FAMILY--DESCENDENTS OF THE ORIGINAL \"WAHHABI,\" 
     MEMBERS OF THE AL-SUDAYRI FAMILY, CADET BRANCHES OF THE ROYAL 
     FAMILY, SUCH AS THE BIN JILUWI--FAMOUS COMRADES-IN-ARMS WITH 
     THE KINGDOM\'S FOUNDER ABD AL-AZIZ, AND DESCENDANTS OF 
     INDIVIDUAL SOLDIERS WHO ASSISTED ABD AL-AZIZ IN HIS CONQUEST 
     OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. 
 
  -- FULFILLMENT OF FINANCIAL PROMISES MADE BY SENIOR PRINCES, SUCH 
     AS CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH OR RIYADH GOVERNOR SALMAN, TO AVERAGE 
     SAUDIS, MOST LIKELY DURING A MAJLIS WHEN NUMEROUS SAUDIS 
     PERSONALLY APPROACH AND PETITION SENIOR LEADERS. 
 
9.  (S)  THE STREAM OF PETITIONERS INTO AL-SHUBAYLI\'S OFFICE DURING 
THE MEETING GENERALLY WERE OF TWO TYPES:  THOSE SEEKING FOLLOW- 
THROUGH OF A ROYAL COMMITMENT, AND THOSE SEEKING TO VERIFY 
LEGITIMATE REGISTRATION ON THE ROLES AS RECIPIENTS OF MONTHLY 
STIPENDS. 
 
10.  (S) THE FIRST TYPE INCLUDED MANY PETITIONERS WHO HAD SLIPS OF 
PAPER WITH ROYAL DIWAN LETTERHEAD CARRYING HAND-SCRAWLED ARABIC 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSISTANCE.  AL-SHUBAYLI GENERALLY GRUDGINGLY 
APPROVED THESE, BUT IT WAS CLEAR TO ECONOFF THAT AN IMPORTANT PART 
OF HIS JOB, AT LEAST IN TODAY\'S MORE FISCALLY DISCIPLINED 
ENVIRONMENT, IS TO PLAY THE ROLE OF BAD COP.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE 
INTENSELY AND RUDELY GRILLED A NEARLY BLIND OLD MAN ON WHY AN EYE 
OPERATION PROMISED BY A PRINCE AND CONFIRMED BY ROYAL DIWAN NOTE 
HAD TO BE CONDUCTED OVERSEAS AND NOT FOR FREE IN ONE OF THE FIRST 
CLASS EYE HOSPITALS IN THE KINGDOM.  AFTER LISTENING FOR SOME 
MINUTES TO THE REQUISITE GROVELING AND PLEADING, AL-SHUBAYLI SIGNED 
OFF ON THE REQUEST.  AFTER THIS PARTICULAR EPISODE, AL-SHUBAYLI 
TURNED TO ECONOFF AND NOTED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE U.S. TWICE FOR 
MEDICAL TREATMENT HIMSELF, ONCE FOR A CHRONIC ULCER AND ONCE FOR 
CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME.  HE CHUCKLED, SUGGESTING THAT BOTH WERE 
PROBABLY JOB-INDUCED. 
 
11.  (C)  AL-SHUBAYLI HAS BEEN THE ONLY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE 
SINCE ITS CREATION UNDER KING ABD AL-AZIZ ALMOST HALF A CENTURY AGO 
WHEN IT WAS CALLED THE RIYADH FINANCE OFFICE.  HE CLEARLY REALIZES 
THAT DISCRETION IS KEY TO KEEPING HIS JOB.  WHEN ASKED BY ECONOFF 
WHAT HIS OFFICE DOES, HE SAID \"FINANCIAL THINGS, LIKE ANY OFFICE OF 
THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE.\"  WHEN ASKED WHETHER THE SAG\'S AUSTERITY 
BUDGETS WERE AFFECTING HIS OFFICE, HE INITIALLY JUST ANSWERED, \"OF 
COURSE.\"  HE LATER NOTED THAT THE OFFICE HAD RECENTLY PUT OUT THE 
WORD THAT ALL RECIPIENTS OF MONTHLY STIPENDS HAD TO COME INTO THE 
OFFICE TO VERIFY THEIR RIGHT TO BE ON THE ROLLS.  HE MENTIONED THAT 
HE HAD DISCOVERED CASES OF SERVANTS WHO WERE STILL PICKING UP 
MONTHLY STIPENDS FOR RECIPIENTS WHO HAD DIED.  THIS EXPLAINED THE 
SECOND TYPE OF PETITIONERS PRESENT DURING ECONOFF\'S VISIT.  ONE 
SAUDI SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED HIS RIGHT TO A STIPEND WITH A SERIAL 
NUMBER FROM THE RIFLE HIS FATHER HAD USED IN BATTLE WITH ABD AL- 
AZIZ.  ANOTHER, WHOM ECONOFF VAGUELY RECOGNIZED, INTRODUCED HIMSELF 
AS THE SAUDI TV WEATHERMAN.  AFTER JOKING ABOUT THE MONOTONY OF HIS 
JOB--ALWAYS FORECASTING \"HOT AND DRY\"--HE TOLD ECONOFF THAT HE WAS 
IN RIYADH TO VERIFY THAT HIS INFIRM UNCLE IN JEDDAH BELONGED ON THE 
ROLLS. 
 
12.  (S)  EVEN WITH HIS RETICENCE, AL-SHUBAYLI NOTED THE OBVIOUS, 
THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE OFFICE IS TAKING FINANCIAL 
CARE OF ROYALS.  WHILE AL-SHUBAYLI REFUSED TO ELABORATE, ACCORDING 
TO A VARIETY OF SOURCES, ROYAL FAMILY STIPENDS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 
 
  -- THE REMAINING SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF ABD AL-AZIZ ARE ON 
     INDIVIDUAL PAY SCALES, RANGING FROM ABOUT $200,000 TO $270,000 
     PER MONTH ($1 EQUALS 3.75 SR). 
 
  -- GRANDCHILDREN OF ABD AL-AZIZ RECEIVE IN THE RANGE OF $27,000 
     PER MONTH, ACCORDING TO ONE CONTACT FAMILIAR WITH THE 
     STIPENDS.  PRINCE AL-WALID BIN TALAL TOLD BUSINESS WEEK THAT 
     HE, AS A GRANDSON, RECEIVED ABOUT $19,000 PER MONTH. 
 
  -- GREAT GRANDCHILDREN GENERALLY RECEIVE ABOUT $13,000, AND GREAT 
     GREAT GRANDCHILDREN RECEIVE $8,000 PER MONTH. 
 
  -- UPON MARRYING, A PRINCE CAN RECEIVE A STIPEND OF ABOUT $1 - 3 
     MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A PALACE, THOUGH THIS GRANT IS NOT 
     AUTOMATIC AND REQUIRES SOME INFLUENCE WITH THE ROYAL DIWAN. 
     MONTHLY STIPENDS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON WHETHER A ROYAL IS 
     SINGLE OR MARRIED. 
 
  -- AMOUNTS FOR DISTANT ROYALS OR PRIVILEGED NON-ROYALS IS 
     SUBSTANTIALLY LESS.  THE LEAST ONE RECEIVES IS $800 PER MONTH. 
     A TYPICAL MID-LEVEL MEMBER OF A NON-ROYAL RECIPIENT FAMILY 
     WOULD RECEIVE ABOUT $5,000 PER MONTH. 
 
13.  (C)  BASED ON THE ABOVE SCALE AND ASSUMING ABOUT 60 REMAINING 
     SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF ABD AL-AZIZ, AND AN AVERAGE 7 CHILDREN PER 
     PARENT (420 GRANDCHILDREN, 2,900 GREAT GRANDCHILDREN, AND PROBABLY 
     ONLY ABOUT 2,000 GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN AT THIS POINT), TOTAL 
     ANNUAL STIPEND PAYMENTS WOULD AMOUNT TO OVER $2 BILLION.  THE 
     STIPENDS ALSO PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL INCENTIVE FOR ROYALS TO 
     PROCREATE SINCE THE STIPENDS BEGIN AT BIRTH.  A SAUDI WHO RECENTLY 
     ATTENDED PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY TOLD ECONOFF THAT THERE IS A 
     PRINCE IN THE SMALL PORTLAND, OREGON SAUDI STUDENTS ASSOCIATION WHO 
     HAS CONVINCED A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO CARRY HIM ON THE ROLLS 
     EVEN THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER ATTEND A CLASS.  ACCORDING TO THIS 
     SAUDI, THE PRINCE\'S MAIN GOAL IN LIFE IS TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN SO 
     HE CAN INCREASE HIS MONTHLY ALLOWANCE. 
 
 
------------------- 
OFF-BUDGET PROGRAMS 
------------------- 
 
14.  (S)  WHILE THE STIPEND SYSTEM IS THE OFFICIAL MECHANISM FOR 
TAKING CARE OF ROYALS\' FINANCIAL NEEDS, IT IS CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH 
FOR MANY PRINCES, AND SEVERAL OTHER ENRICHING PRACTICES, GENERALLY 
VIEWED AS CORRUPT, OCCUR.  BY FAR THE LARGEST IS LIKELY ROYAL 
SKIMMING FROM THE APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION IN ANNUAL OFF-BUDGET 
SPENDING CONTROLLED BY A FEW KEY PRINCES, PRIMARILY DEFENSE 
MINISTER SULTAN.  TWO OF THESE PROJECTS--THE TWO HOLY MOSQUES 
PROJECT (ABOUT $5 BILLION PER YEAR) AND THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE\'S 
STRATEGIC STORAGE PROJECT (ABOUT $1 BILLION PER YEAR)--ARE HIGHLY 
SECRETIVE, SUBJECT TO NO MINISTRY OF FINANCE OVERSIGHT OR CONTROLS, 
TRANSACTED THROUGH THE NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK (SEE BELOW), AND 
WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE A SOURCE OF SUBSTANTIAL REVENUES FOR THE KING 
AND A FEW OF HIS FULL BROTHERS.  IN A RECENT MEETING WITH THE 
AMBASSADOR, SAUDI BILLIONAIRE PRINCE AL-WALID BIN TALAL, ALLUDING 
TO THESE OFF-BUDGET PROGRAMS, LAMENTED THE TRAVESTY THAT REVENUES 
FROM \"ONE MILLION BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY\" GO ENTIRELY TO \"FIVE OR 
SIX PRINCES.\" 
 
 
----------------- 
GOING TO THE BANK 
----------------- 
 
15.  (S)  THE TWELVE COMMERCIAL BANKS IN THE COUNTRY ARE GENERALLY 
LEARY OF LENDING TO ROYALS BECAUSE THE BANKS HAVE LIMITED RECOURSE 
SHOULD A PRINCE DEFAULT ON A LOAN.  NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK (NCB) 
HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY BANK OF THE ROYAL FAMILY FOR MANY YEARS.  IN 
THE LATE 1980S AND EARLY 1990S, NCB\'S NON-PERFORMING ROYAL LOAN 
PROBLEMS WERE SO SEVERE THAT THE BANK NEARLY COLLAPSED.  KING FAHD 
REPORTEDLY INJECTED $2 BILLION OF PERSONAL FUNDS INTO THE BANK TO 
RESTORE ITS FINANCIAL INTEGRITY.  THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF A MAJOR 
BANK IN THE KINGDOM TOLD EMBOFFS THAT HIS BANK, WITH LOANS TO FEWER 
THAN A DOZEN PRINCES, WAS PROBABLY AT THE LOW END OF THE SPECTRUM 
IN TERMS OF EXPOSURE TO ROYALS.  HE IS CARRYING TWO NON-PERFORMING 
LOANS--ONE FOR 300 MILLION SR TO PRINCE SATTAM BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, AND 
ANOTHER SMALLER LOAN TO A SON OF PRINCE SALMAN BIN ABD AL-AZIZ. 
THE BANK WITH PROBABLY THE LOWEST EXPOSURE TO ROYALS IS THE 
KINGDOM\'S ONLY ISLAMIC BANK--AL-RAJHI.  ACCORDING TO ITS TOP 
OFFICER, THE BANK HAS A STRICT POLICY AGAINST LENDING TO THE AL 
SAUD.  HE SAYS THE BANK HAS ONLY MADE TWO EXCEPTIONS, TO PRINCES 
WHO HAVE BEEN LONGSTANDING RELIABLE CUSTOMERS OF THE BANK.  AT THE 
HIGH END ARE NCB AND SAUDI AMERICAN BANK (SAMBA).  IN ITS LATEST 
FINANCIAL REPORT, FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1996, SAMBA REPORTED 
LOWER PROFITS THAN LAST YEAR DUE IN PART TO A 200 MILLION SR 
PROVISION FOR A BAD LOAN, WHICH, ACCORDING TO A SAMBA OFFICER, IS 
TO ONE OF THE BROTHERS OF KING FAHD\'S WIFE.  THE BANKS HAVE THE 
FREEDOM TO REFUSE DOING BUSINESS WITH ROYALS, BUT BANKS SUCH AS NCB 
AND SAMBA HAVE HAD A POLICY OF ATTRACTING SUCH \"HIGH NET WORTH 
CLIENTS\" TO THEIR PRIVATE BANKING DEPARTMENTS TO ADD PRESTIGE TO 
THE BANK. 
 
16.  (S)  THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF A MAJOR BANK IN THE KINGDOM TOLD 
THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE VIEWS ROYALS IN FOUR TIERS, WHICH DETERMINE 
HOW HIS BANK DEALS WITH THEM:  THE TOP TIER IS THE SENIORMOST 
PRINCES, GENERALLY THE MOST WELL-KNOWN SONS OF ABD AL-AZIZ.  SOME 
OF THESE HAVE ACCOUNTS AT THE BANK, BUT, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THEIR 
EXORBITANT WEALTH, THEY NEVER ASK THE BANK FOR LOANS.  THE SECOND 
TIER INCLUDES SENIOR PRINCES KNOWN TO BE INCREDIBLY WEALTHY BUT WHO 
OFTEN SEEK LOANS FROM THE BANK.  THE BANK INSISTS THAT SUCH LOANS 
BE 100 PERCENT COLLATERALIZED BY DEPOSITS IN OTHER ACCOUNTS AT THE 
BANK.  HE SAYS SUCH ARRANGEMENTS HAVE WORKED WELL FOR THE BANK. 
THE THIRD TIER ARE THE THOUSANDS OF LESSER PRINCES WHOM THE BANK 
REFUSES TO LEND TO.  THE FOURTH TIER, NOT REALLY ROYALS, ARE WHAT 
THIS BANKER CALLED THE \"HANGERS ON\"--PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR PRINCES 
AND WHOSE \"CASH FLOWS\" CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY FROM ONE DAY TO THE 
NEXT.  THESE, HE SAID, HAVE MOST RECENTLY GIVEN THE BANK THE MOST 
TROUBLE. 
 
17.  (S)  WITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS, THERE IS NOT EXTENSIVE 
ROYAL OWNERSHIP OF THE TWELVE COMMERCIAL BANKS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
PRINCE AL-WALID BIN TALAL IS THE MAJORITY OWNER OF UNITED SAUDI 
COMMERCIAL BANK AND HE IS TRYING TO ACQUIRE SAUDI CAIRO BANK. 
RUMORS ARE THAT OTHER PRINCES, JEALOUS OF HIS SUCCESS, ARE TRYING 
TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION.  THE BANKING COMMUNITY EXPECTS THAT HE 
WILL MERGE THE TWO BANKS IF HE SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRES SAUDI CAIRO 
BANK.  A SECOND RUMOR IN THE BANKING COMMUNITY IS THAT THE MONEY 
BEHIND KHALID BIN MAHFUZ\'S RECENT ACQUISITION OF 100 PERCENT 
OWNERSHIP OF NCB--THE LARGEST BANK IN THE KINGDOM--CAME FROM THE 
KING\'S SON, ABD AL-AZIZ BIN FAHD, WHO IS THE SHADOW OWNER.  IT IS 
WIDELY VIWED IN BANKING CIRCLES THAT KHALID BIN MAHFUZ, A FORMER 
BCCI INDICTEE, COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN CENTRAL BANK APPROVAL TO FULLY 
OWN NCB WITHOUT THE MOST SENIOR ROYAL BACKING.  SAUDI HOLLANDI BANK 
IS MAJORITY OWNED BY THE CONGLOMERATE AL-MAWARID, WHICH IN TURN IS 
OWNED BY PRINCES.  THE MAJORITY OWNERS OF THE OTHER BANKS ARE 
GENERALLY THE LARGE NON-ROYAL BUSINESS FAMILIES IN THE KINGDOM. 
 
 
---------- 
LAND GRABS 
---------- 
 
18.  (C) STORIES ABOUND OF SOME GREEDY PRINCES EXPROPRIATING LAND 
FROM COMMONERS.  GENERALLY, THE INTENT IS TO RESELL QUICKLY AT HUGE 
MARKUP TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR AN UPCOMING PROJECT.  DISCONTENT OVER 
ROYAL USURPATION OF LANDS HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY SAG CUTBACKS IN 
LAND DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS WHICH PRIMARILY BENEFITED THE MIDDLE 
CLASS.  FROM THE MID-1970S TO THE LATE 1980S THE SAG UNDERTOOK AN 
AMBITIOUS, AND POPULAR, LAND GRANT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO SETTLE 
NOMADIC POPULATIONS AND TO GARNER THE SUPPORT OF THE SAUDI 
POPULACE.  OVER 1.3 MILLION RESIDENTIAL PARCELS WERE DISTRIBUTED 
FREE OF CHARGE THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM, WITH LITTLE MORE THAN A 
PETITION TO THE LOCAL GOVERNOR REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE DEED.  AN 
EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WAS ADMINISTERED BY ARAMCO, WHOSE 
ENVIRONS TODAY ARE SURROUNDED BY UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOODS SETTLED BY 
EMPLOYEES WITH THE HELP OF A COMPANY-DEEDED PIECE OF PROPERTY AND 
NO-INTEREST LOANS. 
 
19.  (C)  THE LAND GRANT PROGRAM HAS NOW DWINDLED TO AN EPISODIC 
GESTURE OF ROYAL LARGESSE, PERHAPS BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF GRANTS WAS 
STRESSING THE GOVERNMENT\'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE -- 
WATER, ELECTRICITY, AND ROADS.  SIMILARLY, ARAMCO, HAVING 
DISTRIBUTED OVER 30,000 PLOTS OF LAND, RAN OUT OF DESIRABLE ACREAGE 
AND NOW OFFERS A LUMP SUM CASH PAYMENT.  WHEN COMBINED WITH THE 
ABSENCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS FROM THE COMMERCIAL BANKS, A DECADE-LONG 
WAITING LIST FOR A GOVERNMENT HOME LOAN, THE RESULT IS THAT HOME 
OWNERSHIP IS BECOMING AN ELUSIVE GOAL FOR YOUNG, NON-ROYAL SAUDIS. 
 
20.  (S)  AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, ROYAL LAND SCAMS INCREASINGLY HAVE 
BECOME A POINT OF PUBLIC CONTENTION.  IN THE 1993 \"MEMORANDUM OF 
ADVICE\" PETITION SIGNED BY OVER 100 OF THE KINGDOM\'S MORE ACTIVIST 
CLERICS, THE KING WAS URGED TO HALT THE DISTRIBUTION OF LAND, 
EXCEPT TO THOSE WITH LIMITED INCOMES OR NO PLACE TO LIVE.  MINISTER 
OF DEFENSE SULTAN, HIS SONS, AND THE OFFSPRING OF KING FAHD ARE THE 
MOST OFT-CITED SENIOR CULPRITS: 
 
  -- ACCORDING TO A BANKER WHO SAYS HE HAS A COPY OF THE WRITTEN 
     INSTRUCTIONS, DEFENSE MINISTER SULTAN ORDERED LOCAL 
     AUTHORITIES IN THE MECCA AREA TO TRANSFER TO HIS NAME A 
     \"WAQF\"--RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENT--OF A SMALL PARCEL OF LAND THAT 
     HAD BEEN IN THE HANDS OF ONE FAMILY LITERALLY FOR CENTURIES. 
     THE BANKER NOTED THAT IT WAS THE BRAZENNESS OF THE LETTER, 
     WITH NO EFFORT TO HIDE THE SIMPLE INTENT OF CONFISCATING LAND, 
     THAT WAS PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS. 
 
  -- THE KING\'S SON, ABD AL-AZIZ BIN FAHD, WAS REPORTEDLY GRANTED 
     THE HUGE EXPANSE OF LAND THAT THE KING KHALID INTERNATIONAL 
     AIRPORT OUTSIDE OF RIYADH WAS BUILT ON FOR RESALE TO THE 
     GOVERNMENT FOR THE PROJECT. 
 
  -- PRINCE MISHAL BIN ABD AL-AZIZ (ELDER HALF-BROTHER OF SULTAN), 
     WHO ACCEDED TO BEING PASSED OVER IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION, IS 
     FAMOUS FOR THROWING FENCES UP AROUND VAST STRETCHES OF 
     GOVERNMENT LAND.  ONE CONTRACTOR REPORTS BEING ORDERED BY 
     MISHAL TO KEEP EXTENDING THE PERIMETER OF THE FENCE ENCIRCLING 
     HIS DESERT PROPERTY OUTSIDE OF RIYADH UNTIL AN ADDITIONAL 80 
     SQUARE KILOMETERS OF LAND WERE INCORPORATED INTO HIS PRIVATE 
     ESTATE.  LIKEWISE, MISHAL HAS ACQUIRED A 450 SQUARE KILOMETER 
     TRACT ENVELOPING THE KING KHALID MILITARY CITY OUTSIDE OF HAFR 
     AL-BATIN. 
 
  -- MISHAL\'S FULL BROTHER, MITIB BIN ABD AL-AZIZ, IS THE 
     BENEFICIARY OF ALL LAND RECLAMATION PROJECTS ALONG THE ARABIAN 
     GULF.  THIS RIGHT WAS GRANTED AFTER MITIB INSISTED THAT HIS 
     FATHER, KING ABD AL-AZIZ, HAD PROMISED HIM ALL OF THE 
     KINGDOM\'S FISHERY RIGHTS.  THE FAMILY\'S COMPROMISE WAS TO 
     CREATE THE NATIONAL FISHERIES COMPANY, OF WHICH MITIB WAS MADE 
     A PARTNER, AND TO CEDE HIM THE RIGHTS TO ALL RECLAIMED LANDS 
     IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE. 
 
21.  (S)  THE CONFISCATION OF LAND BY SOME GREEDY PRINCES EXTENDS 
TO BUSINESSES AS WELL.  ONE PROMINENT AND WEALTHY SAUDI BUSINESSMAN 
REPORTS THAT ONE REASON SOME WEALTHY SAUDIS KEEP SO MUCH MONEY 
INVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY IS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT FACE THE 
RISK ABROAD OF \"ROYAL EXPROPRIATION\" OF BUSINESS ASSETS.  ACCORDING 
TO THIS BUSINESSMAN, AS SOON AS A SMALL BUSINESS SHOWS SIGNS OF 
HIGH GROWTH AND PROFIT POTENTIAL, THE OWNER, PARTICULARLY IF HE IS 
KNOWN TO BE WELL-OFF, WILL COME UNDER PRESSURE FROM ROYALS TO SELL 
OR GO INTO PARTNERSHIP.  AS A RESULT, MANY OF THE MORE PROMINENT 
BUSINESSMEN NOW CHOOSE TO USE A LESSER NAME SAUDI AS A SHADOW OWNER 
OF A BUSINESS TO AVOID DRAWING THE ATTENTION OF BUSINESS-HUNGRY 
PRINCES. 
 
 
--------------- 
THE VISA RACKET 
--------------- 
 
22.  (C)  A PHENOMENON OF THE PAST FIVE OR SO YEARS HAS BEEN THE 
ROYAL SPONSORSHIP OF EXPATRIATE LABOR FOR PROFIT.  EVERY FOREIGN 
WORKER IN THE COUNTRY HAS TO BE SPONSORED BY A SAUDI TO OBTAIN AN 
IQAMA--RESIDENCE PERMIT.  PERMISSION TO SPONSOR FOREIGN WORKERS IS 
GRANTED BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOR.  THE AVERAGE SAUDI CAN SPONSOR 
FIVE OR SO, ENOUGH TO HIRE MAIDS, NANNIES, AND DRIVERS. 
BUSINESSMEN CAN GENERALLY GET PERMISSION TO HIRE EXPATS TO FILL 
JOBS IN THEIR COMPANIES, ALTHOUGH THIS IS GETTING HARDER WITH THE 
SAG PUSH TO SAUDIIZE THE WORKFORCE.  ROYALS CAN GET PERMISSION FROM 
THE MINISTRY TO SPONSOR SEEMINGLY UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF EXPATS, EVEN 
THOUGH THEY HAVE NO WORK FOR THEM. 
 
23.  (C)  IT IS COMMON FOR A PRINCE TO SPONSOR A HUNDRED OR MORE 
FOREIGNERS, KNOWN HERE AS \"FREELANCERS,\" WHO ARE ALLOWED TO FIND 
THEIR OWN JOBS, MOST OFTEN AS SERVANTS OR UNSKILLED LABORORS.  IN 
EXCHANGE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING IN SAUDI ARABIA, THESE 
FOREIGNERS PAY THEIR ROYAL SPONSOR A NOMINAL FEE--$30 TO $150 PER 
MONTH, WHICH ADDS UP TO A SUBSTANTIAL TAKE FOR SOMEONE SPONSORING 
OVER A HUNDRED EXPATS--ON AVERAGE ABOUT $10,000 PER MONTH PER 100 
EXPATS UNDER SPONSORSHIP. 
 
24.  (C)  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PRACTICE WAS LARGELY BEHIND THE 
RAPID GROWTH IN THE EXPATRIATE POPULATION, FROM ABOUT 4.2 MILLION 
TO 6.5 MILLION, BETWEEN 1992 AND 1995.  WITH THE ECONOMY GROWING AT 
1 PERCENT OR LESS DURING THOSE YEARS, JOB EXPANSION WAS NOT 
JUSTIFYING THE RAPID EXPATRIATE POPULATION GROWTH.  IN JANUARY 
1995, THE SAG RAISED THE PRICE FOR A 2-YEAR IQAMA TO A HEFTY 2,000 
SR ($533).  THIS COMBINED WITH THE COST OF HOMEWARD PASSAGE FOR 
WORKERS WHICH MUST BE BORNE BY SPONSORS IS NOW MAKING IT 
UNECONOMICAL TO ENGAGE IN THE WIDESPREAD SPONSORSHIP OF 
FREELANCERS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXPAT POPULATION HAS LEVELED 
OFF OR IS IN DECLINE AS A RESULT.  ONE INDICATION OF THIS IS THAT 
THE CENTRAL BANK HAS REPORTED THAT EXPATRIATE WORKER REMITTANCES 
ARE DOWN FROM $12 BILLION IN THE FIRST 9 MONTHS OF 1995 TO $9.9 
BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 1996. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
PRINCES BETTER AT SPENDING THAN SAVING 
-------------------------------------- 
 
25.  (S)  ALL THE WEALTH THAT HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO PRINCES OVER 
THE PAST 20 YEARS HAS NOT CREATED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SUPER- 
RICH PRINCES.  THERE ARE MORE NON-ROYAL BILLIONAIRES THAN ROYAL 
ONES.  THE HEADS OF THE BIG BUSINESS FAMILIES--AL-JOMAIH, AL- 
JUFFALI, BIN MAHFUZ, AL-RAJHI, OLAYAN, JAMEEL, AL-RASHID, FOR 
EXAMPLE--ARE KNOWN BILLIONAIRES WHILE ONLY A HANDFUL OF PRINCES ARE 
IN THE SAME LEAGUE. THE LONE EXCEPTION OF A PRINCE WHO HAS TURNED 
HIS SEED MONEY INTO A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR EMPIRE IS AL-WALID BIN 
TALAL--THE SON OF AN OUTCAST SON OF ABD AL-AZIZ.  WE CALCULATE THAT 
HIS FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENTS GIVE HIM A NET WORTH OF ABOUT 
$13 BILLION.  THE OTHER BILLIONAIRE PRINCES AND OUR ESTIMATE OF 
THEIR WORTH ARE KING FAHD -- $10 BILLION, DEFENSE MINISTER PRINCE 
SULTAN -- $10 BILLION, AND HIS SON KHALID BIN SULTAN -- $2 BILLION. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  AL SAUD INC. -- NO END IN SIGHT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
26.  (S)  WHILE ROYALTY HERE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE WEALTH AND THE 
TRAPPINGS OF POWER TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, THERE IS A BROAD SENTIMENT 
THAT ROYAL GREED HAS GONE BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF REASON.  ROYAL 
EXCESS IS A COMMON TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AMONG NON-ROYAL SAUDIS AND 
EXPATRIATES ALIKE.  PALACE CONSTRUCTION, KNOWN TO BE FINANCED FOR 
EVERY PRINCE THROUGH THE STIPEND SYSTEM, IS A VISIBLE SIGN OF SUCH 
EXCESS.  ONE PALACE IN DOWNTOWN RIYADH HAS NEVER BEEN OCCUPIED 
BECAUSE THE ROYAL BUILDER SIMPLY DIDN\'T LIKE IT.  IT NOW STANDS AS 
A MONOLITHIC REMINDER OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION.  SUCH EXCESSES 
WERE TOLERABLE WHEN THE ECONOMIC TIDE WAS RISING FOR EVERYONE. 
NOW, WITH FLAT PER CAPITA GDP AND A GENERAL SENSE THAT QUALITY OF 
LIFE IS DECLINING FOR THE AVERAGE SAUDI, THE TRANSFER OF SO MUCH 
STATE WEALTH IS RESENTED AND ONE OF THE COMBUSTIBLE MIXES BESETTING 
SAUDI ARABIA\'S FUTURE.  AS IF THIS WEREN\'T ENOUGH, THE ROYAL FAMILY 
IS INCREASINGLY ALIENATING THE MERCHANT CLASS (AS EXAMINED SEPTEL) 
VIA PERVASIVE VIOLATION OF A DICTUM BY THE KINGDOM\'S FOUNDER, ABD 
AL-AZIZ, THAT ROYALS STAY OUT OF BUSINESS. 
 
27.  (S)  THERE IS SOME SENTIMENT THAT CROWN PRINCE ABDALLAH, AS 
KING, WOULD INTERCEDE TO ROLL BACK THE ROYAL TAKE.  IT IS NOT CLEAR 
YET, HOWEVER, THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE POWER OR INCLINATION TO MAKE 
SWEEPING CHANGES, BY, FOR EXAMPLE, ELIMINATING OFF-BUDGET PROGRAMS 
OR EVEN CURTAILING THE STIPEND SYSTEM.  EVEN WITH STIPEND AMOUNTS 
REMAINING FLAT, DISBURSEMENTS ARE GROWING WITH THE HIGH POPULATION 
GROWTH OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.  SUCH CUTTING BACK INTERNALLY MIGHT 
FURTHER FRACTURE THE RULING CLAN. 
 
28.  (S)  IT IS OUR ASSESSMENT THAT OF THE PRIORITY ISSUES THE 
COUNTRY FACES, GETTING A GRIP ON ROYAL FAMILY EXCESSES IS AT THE 
TOP.  BUT AS LONG AS THE ROYAL FAMILY VIEWS THIS COUNTRY AS \"AL 
SAUD INC.,\" EVER INCREASING NUMBERS OF PRINCES AND PRINCESSES WILL 
SEE IT AS THEIR BIRTHRIGHT TO RECEIVE LAVISH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND 
DIP INTO THE TILL FROM TIME TO TIME, BY SHEER VIRTUE OF COMPANY 
OWNERSHIP.

DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT FOR REAP 
 
E.O. 12958:  N/A 
TAGS: PTER, SA 
SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA:  1997 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 223177 
 
1.   THE FOLLOWING RESTATES AND RESPONDS TO EACH OF THE QUESTIONS 
SET FORTH IN REFTEL. 
 
A.   DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF EACH COUNTRY 
TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 1997, INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION RELATING TO TERRORISM.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE 
GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT ACTIONS REGARDING ACTS OF TERRORISM 
AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG IS CONTINUING ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE KHOBAR 
TOWERS BOMB ATTACK OF JUNE 1996 WHICH KILLED 19 U.S. MILITARY 
PERSONNEL.  ALTHOUGH THE SAG HAS REPORTEDLY DETAINED AND ARRESTED 
SAUDI CITIZENS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING, IT HAS NOT YET BEGUN 
PROSECUTION OR TAKEN ANY OTHER PUBLIC LEGAL ACTION REGARDING ANY 
SUCH PERSONS.  THERE WERE NO OTHER KNOWN TERRORIST CASES OR ACTIONS 
THAT CAME BEFORE THE JUDICIARY IN 1997. 
 
B.   DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION 
OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR? 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO 
U.S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG REQUESTED THAT CANADA DEPORT SAUDI CITIZEN HANI 
AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA.  CANADIAN OFFICIALS DETAINED AL-SAYEGH 
ON CHARGES OF DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUNE 1996 KHOBAR TOWERS 
BOMB ATTACK.  HOWEVER, CANADA DEPORTED AL-SAYEGH TO THE UNITED 
STATES.  THE SAG HAS NOW REQUESTED THAT THE USG DEPORT AL-SAYEGH TO 
SAUDI ARABIA.  THE SAG SEEKS TO QUESTION AND PERHAPS PROSECUTE AL- 
SAYEGH FOR HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN THE KILLING OF 19 UNITED STATES 
MILITARY PERSONNEL IN THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING.  THE SAG HAS ALSO 
REPORTEDLY REQUESTED THAT THE TALIBAN GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN 
PROHIBIT SAUDI BORN TERRORIST FINANCIER AND SUPPORTER USAMA BIN 
LADEN FROM INSTIGATING OR ENCOURAGING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST 
SAUDI ARABIA OR ITS WESTERN ALLIES.  BIN LADEN, WHO WAS STRIPPED OF 
HIS SAUDI CITIZENSHIP IN 1994, ENCOURAGES AND IS BELIEVED TO 
PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS IN ACTS OF 
TERRORISM AGAINST THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY AND COUNTRIES SUPPORTIVE 
OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES.  THE SAG IS 
REPORTED TO HAVE UNSUCCESSFULLY REQUESTED THAT SYRIA EXTRADITE OR 
DEPORT A SUSPECT IN THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING TO SAUDI ARABIA FOR 
QUESTIONING AND POSSIBLE PROSECUTION.  THE SUSPECT IN QUESTION WAS 
REPORTED TO HAVE DIED WHILE IN POLICE CUSTODY IN SYRIA. 
 
C.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
RESPONSE:  NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO THE SAG\'S 
PROSECUTION OF PERSONS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED TERRORIST ACTS 
WITHIN SAUDI ARABIA.  HOWEVER, THE SAG HAS NOT ENTERED INTO 
EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE 
UNITED STATES.  (NOTE:  EXTRADITION TREATIES EXIST WITH YEMEN AND 
EGYPT.) 
 
D.   DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. 
THIS WOULD INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A 
TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST 
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG AT ALL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE KING, CROWN PRINCE, 
MINISTER OF INTERIOR, OFFICIAL ISLAMIC CLERGY, AND OFFICIAL NEWS 
MEDIA, PUBLICLY AND CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS TERRORISM IN UNEQUIVOCAL 
TERMS.  THE SAG STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE NOVEMBER 1997 LUXOR MASSACRE 
IN EGYPT.  THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR TOWERS 
BOMBING AND HAS ASSISTED THE USG IN ITS OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE 
BOMBING.  HOWEVER, PRESS REPORTS ASSERTED THAT THE USG EXPRESSED 
FRUSTRATION AT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO EVIDENCE AND SUSPECTS. 
ACCORDING TO HIGH LEVEL SAG OFFICIALS, THE SAUDI JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
(SHARIA) DOES NOT ALLOW FOREIGNERS DIRECT FACE TO FACE ACCESS TO 
SUSPECTS. 
 
E.   DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1997 BY 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR TOWERS 
BOMBING.  IT HAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN NUMEROUS MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN 
SECURITY PROTECTION OF U.S. MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL. 
THESE STEPS INCLUDE ASSISTING IN THE RELOCATION OF U.S. DEPLOYED 
PERSONNEL AND MANY TRAINING MISSION PERSONNEL TO PRINCE SULTAN 
AIRBASE AND ESKAN VILLAGE, LOCATIONS REMOVED FROM POPULATION 
CENTERS, AND INCREASING SECURITY MEASURES AT OFFICIAL U.S. 
PREMISES.  AT A MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF ARAB LEAGUE INTERIOR 
MINISTERS IN TUNIS, THE SAG ENDORSED A NON-BINDING ARAB LEAGUE 
ACTION PLAN TO COMBAT TERRORISM.  AT A DOHA MEETING OF THE GCC 
INTERIOR MINISTERS, THE SAG AGREED TO INCREASE SECURITY COOPERATION 
AND COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AMONG THE MEMBER STATES.  AT A MEETING 
OF ARAB JUSTICE MINISTERS IN CAIRO, THE SAG JOINED THE OTHER MEMBER 
STATES IN CALLING FOR THE ADOPTION OF A PLAN TO ALLOW FOR THE 
EXTRADITION AMONG ARAB STATES OF MILITANTS SOUGHT IN CONNECTION 
WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE SAG ALSO ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF 
UNDERSTANDING WITH THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT REGARDING TERRORISM. 
 
F.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORIST, OR TERRORIST GROUPS, INCLUDING 
(BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS 
OR THEIR ACTIVITIES; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC 
RECOGNITION; MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC 
PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; PROVISION SANCTUARY AND/OR 
PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF TERRORIST GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING OR 
TRAINING SITES; PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON 
TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG DOES NOT FINANCIALLY SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR ACTIVITIES.  ITS REGULATIONS REQUIRE 
THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY AGENCIES 
OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR 
DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES.  NONETHELESS, THERE CONTINUE TO 
BE ALLEGATIONS THAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
REPRESENTATIVES SOLICIT AND COLLECT PRIVATE FUNDS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
G.   HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT 
OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE SEVEN 
COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S SO-CALLED \"TERRORISM LIST\" OF STATE SPONSORS 
OF TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, AND 
SUDAN.) 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG DID NOT MAKE OFFICIAL PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
SPECIFICALLY SUPPORTING ANY OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S 
TERRORISM LIST REGARDING A TERRORIST ISSUE.  HOWEVER, THE SAG 
JOINED IN THE NON-BINDING ARAB LEAGUE RESOLUTION TO LIFT UNITED 
NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA DESPITE LIBYA\'S 
FAILURE TO COOPERATE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
BOMBING OF A PAN AM PASSENGER JET OVER LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND.  THE 
SAG ALLOWED LIBYAN AND IRAQI AIRCRAFT CARRYING HAJJ PILGRIMS TO 
LAND AT JEDDAH\'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND DEPART IN VIOLATION OF 
UNSC SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON LIBYA AND IRAQ.  THE SAG HAS REPEATEDLY 
COMMENTED PUBLICLY THAT ALL PILGRIMS WITH VALID HAJJ VISAS SHOULD 
BE RECEIVED BY SAUDI ARABIA, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MEANS OF 
TRANSPORTATION. 
 
H.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1996, POSITIVE OR 
NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? 
 
RESPONSE:  TERRORIST ATTACKS IN 1995 AND 1996 GREATLY HEIGHTENED 
SAG CONCERNS ABOUT THE THREAT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  THE ATTACKS 
MET WITH WIDESPREAD OFFICIAL AND PUBLIC CONDEMNATION, AND HAVE 
SPURRED GREATER COOPERATION AMONG SAUDI SECURITY ORGANS IN 
ADDRESSING INTERNAL SECURITY ISSUES.  THE SAG HAS ALSO 
SUBSTANTIALLY INTENSIFIED ITS DIALOGUE WITH GCC AND OTHER REGIONAL 
NEIGHBORS ON COMBATING TERRORISM.  ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, THE 
SAG CONTINUES TO BE CONCERNED WITH SAUDIS AND OTHERS WHO RECEIVED 
TRAINING IN AFGHANISTAN IN THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES AND OTHER WEAPONS. 
THREE OF THE FOUR TERRORISTS EXECUTED FOR PERPETRATING THE NOVEMBER 
1995 BOMB ATTACK IN RIYADH RECEIVED SUCH TRAINING DURING THE AFGHAN 
WAR.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT REMAINS VERY CONCERNED WITH A CONTINUED 
TERRORIST PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN, ESPECIALLY TERRORISTS UNDER THE 
LEADERSHIP OF USAMA BIN LADIN, A TERRORIST FINANCIER AND SUPPORTER 
OF SAUDI ORIGIN.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT BIN LADIN 
PROMOTES TERRORISM IN SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 
 
I.  DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH 
RESPECT TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
SPECIFIC U.S. REQUESTS TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT FOR COOPERATION AND 
EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES IN THE HOST COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO TERRORIST GROUPS 
DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.  DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF 
THE HOST COUNTRY\'S COOPERATION WITH THOSE EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES, 
INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS SATISFIED THE 
SPECIFIC REQUESTS. 
 
RESPONSE:  BEGINNING WITH THE 1996 VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA OF A USG 
INTERAGENCY COUNTERTERRORISM TEAM FOLLOWING THE 1995 OPM/SANG 
BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG ENTERED INTO UNPRECEDENTED HIGH-LEVEL, 
COORDINATED, INTERAGENCY CONSULTATIONS ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND 
SECURITY ISSUES WHICH ENGENDERED HIGH-LEVEL SAG INTEREST AND THE 
PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE SAG MINISTRIES.  THIS INTEREST AND 
PARTICIPATION HAS CONTINUED THROUGHOUT 1997.  THE USG AND SAG 
EXCHANGED INFORMATION ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY ISSUES 
AFFECTING AMERICAN AND SAUDI INTERESTS IN THE REGION. 
CONSULTATIONS AND TRAINING FOR SAUDI COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY 
OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES ALSO OCCURRED.  FOLLOWING THE 1996 
KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG FURTHER INCREASED 
COOPERATION.  FBI DIRECTOR LOUIS FREEH VISITED SAUDI ARABIA IN 1997 
TO COORDINATE INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS WITH SAUDI INTERIOR MINISTER 
PRINCE NAIF.  THE FBI MAINTAINS A PERMANENTLY STAFFED LEGAL ATTACHE 
OFFICE IN THE U.S. EMBASSY.  WHILE COOPERATION IN 1997 ON THE 
KHOBAR TOWERS INVESTIGATION WAS STRONG, IT HAS NOT ALWAYS MET THE 
EXPECTATIONS OF USG OFFICIALS.  PRESS REPORTS ASSERTED THAT THE USG 
EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO EVIDENCE AND 
SUSPECTS.  ACCORDING TO HIGH LEVEL SAG OFFICIALS, THE SAUDI 
JUDICIAL SYSTEM (SHARIA) DOES NOT ALLOW FOREIGNERS DIRECT FACE TO 
FACE ACCESS TO SUSPECTS.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SPECIFIC COOPERATION 
BETWEEN THE USG AND THE SAG REGARDING THE ELIMINATION OF 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO TERRORIST GROUPS. 
HOWEVER, THE SAG\'S REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL 
ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY AGENCIES OBTAIN GOVERNMENT 
AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR 
INTERNATIONAL CAUSES. 
 
J.   IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL INFORMATION, IF THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM THE HOST GOVERNMENT DURING 
THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN 
ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS OR 
INTERESTS, PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: 
 
     (I)  THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN APPREHENDING, 
CONVICTING, AND PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE ACT; AND 
 
     (II) IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION 
DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE 
DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES 
CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
RESPONSE: (I) THE SAG HAS SOUGHT TO APPREHEND, CONVICT, AND PUNISH 
THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH THE OPM/SANG AND KHOBAR TOWERS 
BOMBINGS AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS.  IN DOING SO, THE SAG HAS 
COOPERATED WITH THE USG AT UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS.  HOWEVER, THE 
SAG\'S COOPERATION HAS BEEN UNEVEN AND HAS NOT ALWAYS MET THE 
EXPECTATIONS OF USG OFFICIALS.  WHILE SAUDI OFFICIALS AND THE FBI 
HAVE WORKED CLOSELY ON MANY INVESTIGATION ISSUES RELATED TO BOTH 
BOMBINGS, PRESS REPORTS ASSERTED THAT THE USG EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION 
AT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO EVIDENCE AND SUSPECTS.  ACCORDING TO HIGH 
LEVEL SAG OFFICIALS, THE SAUDI JUDICIAL SYSTEM (SHARIA) DOES NOT 
ALLOW FOREIGNERS DIRECT FACE TO FACE ACCESS TO SUSPECTS. 
NONETHELESS, THE USG AND THE SAG CONTINUE TO CONSULT CLOSELY ON THE 
STATUS OF THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING INVESTIGATION. 
 
      (II) THE SAG HAS DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE HUMAN AND FINANCIAL 
RESOURCES TO PROTECT USG PERSONNEL AND INTERESTS FOLLOWING THE 
OPM/SANG AND KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBINGS.  IT MADE AVAILABLE TO 
COALITION FORCES THE PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE AT AL KHARJ, WHERE MOST 
U.S. SERVICEMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE NOW LOCATED, AND A VERY LARGE 
RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND, KNOWN AS ESKAN VILLAGE, SOUTH OF RIYADH FOR 
MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DOD PERSONNEL.  THE SAG SPENT MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS IN FACILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS.  THE SAG ALSO 
WORKED WITH AMERICAN SECURITY PERSONNEL TO ENHANCE PROTECTIVE 
MEASURES AT ALL OTHER USG FACILITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA, INCLUDING THE 
U.S. EMBASSY IN RIYADH AND THE CONSULATES GENERAL IN JEDDAH AND 
DHAHRAN.  USG AND SAG OFFICIALS FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS DOWN 
CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY TO REVIEW THE SAFETY OF AMERICANS IN 
SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
K.   IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION DURING 
THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE 
DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES 
CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG HAS GENERALLY PROVIDED TO THE USG INFORMATION ON 
THREATS DIRECTED AT U.S. INTERESTS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND CONTINUES TO 
LIAISE CLOSELY WITH USG AGENCIES TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS 
AGAINST AMERICANS IN THE KINGDOM.  THREATS HAVE REGULARLY LED TO 
THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF EXTRA SECURITY PERSONNEL AND THE PLACEMENT 
OF PERMANENT PHYSICAL BARRIERS, CHECKPOINTS, AND OTHER VISIBLE 
DETERRENTS.

SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA:  BEDOUIN LORE ON CROWN PRINCE 
          ABDULLAH\'S TRIBAL POWER BASE 
 
REF:  RIYADH 730 
 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION THEODORE KATTOUF. 
REASON:  1.5 (B). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY:  ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THE ANAYZA TRIBE, CROWN 
PRINCE ABDULLAH\'S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF POWER LIES IN THE SHAMMAR AND 
ANAYZA TRIBES.  HE HAS MARRIED INTO BOTH TRIBES, DRAWS ON THEM FOR 
THE MAJORITY OF HIS NATIONAL GUARDSMEN, AND HAS PREVIOUSLY RELIED 
ON THEM TO PRESERVE HIS COMMAND OF THE NATIONAL GUARD IN THE FACE 
OF AN INTRA-FAMILY EFFORT TO DEPRIVE HIM OF IT.  WHETHER TRUE OR 
NOT, THESE COMMENTS REFLECT THE POPULAR LORE UNDERLYING MUCH OF 
ABDULLAH\'S POLITICAL APPEAL TO THE SAUDI PUBLIC.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------- 
TALKING ABOUT ABDULLAH 
---------------------- 
 
3.   (C) POLOFF SPENT A RECENT AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH MEMBERS 
OF THE LEADING FAMILY OF THE SUBAIE, ONE OF THE FOUR PRINCIPAL 
SUBTRIBES OF THE ANAYZA--FIRST IN THE HOME OF A FAMILY MEMBER AND 
THEN IN THE FAMILY TENT.  GATHERED IN THE TENT THAT EVENING WERE 
THREE OF THE TRIBAL SHEIKH\'S BROTHERS, THREE OF HIS FIRST COUSINS 
(TWO OF WHOM ARE U.S.-EDUCATED), NUMEROUS MORE DISTANT COUSINS, 
VARIOUS TRIBAL RETAINERS, AND A VISITING SHEIKH OF ANOTHER TRIBE. 
THEY CHATTED, SIPPED TEA, AND PLAYED CARDS. 
 
4.   (C) IN ADDITION TO CONFIRMING THE WIDELY HELD BELIEF THAT 
CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH IS THE LEAST CORRUPT OR \"CLEANEST\" OF THE 
SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, THE CONVERSATION REVEALED THE 
GREAT EXTENT TO WHICH THESE TRIBESMEN BELIEVE--NO DOUBT TO AN 
EXAGGERATED EXTENT--THAT ABDULLAH\'S POWER BASE LIES IN HIS TRIBAL 
TIES. 
 
-------------------------- 
ABDULLAH\'S TWO MAIN TRIBES 
-------------------------- 
 
5.   (C) SPECIFICALLY, THE CONVERSATION BROUGHT OUT THE FOLLOWING 
BELIEFS.   ABDULLAH\'S TWO MAIN TRIBAL SUPPORTERS ARE THE SHAMMAR-- 
HIS MOTHER\'S TRIBE--AND THE ANAYZA.  BOTH ARE LARGE, HISTORICALLY 
POWERFUL NORTHERN TRIBES.   HE HAS TWICE MARRIED INTO EACH TRIBE, 
THEREBY CEMENTING HIS EXISTING TIES TO THE SHAMMAR (THROUGH HIS 
MOTHER, A SHAMMAR) OR FORGING NEW ONES TO THE ANAYZA.  AS COMMANDER 
OF THE NATIONAL GUARD, ABDULLAH HAS DRAWN PRIMARILY ON THESE TWO 
TRIBES.  OUR SOURCE ESTIMATES THAT SIXTY TO SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF 
THE ACTIVE NATIONAL GUARD ARE SHAMMAR AND ANAYZA TRIBESMEN. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
SAVING HIS COMMAND OF THE NATIONAL GUARD 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6.   (C) ONE MAN TOLD THE FOLLOWING STORY TO ILLUSTRATE THE 
SUPPOSED SUPPORT ABDULLAH RECEIVES FROM THE SHAMMAR AND ANAYZA 
TRIBES.  DURING THE TIME OF KING FAYSAL (D. 1975), CERTAIN FACTIONS 
OF THE ROYAL FAMILY WERE CONCERNED THAT ABDULLAH WAS GROWING TOO 
POWERFUL AND WANTED TO TAKE THE NATIONAL GUARD AWAY FROM HIM AND 
PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF A LESS POWERFUL GOVERNMENT ENTITY.  WHEN 
ABDULLAH WAS IN THE NORTH VISITING THE TRIBES, HE LET THEM KNOW 
THAT HE WAS UPSET BY THE PROSPECT OF LOSING COMMAND OF THE NATIONAL 
GUARD.  ON THE ADVICE OF THE TRIBAL SHEIKHS, ABDULLAH PUT THE 
NATIONAL GUARD ON MANEUVERS AND REMAINED IN THE NORTH WITH THE 
TRIBES.  IN NO TIME, KEY MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY STARTED ASKING 
WHY THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS ON MANEUVERS, WHERE ABDULLAH WAS, AND 
WHO HE WAS WITH.  WHEN THEY LEARNED HE WAS IN THE NORTH WITH 
SHEIKHS OF THE SHAMMAR AND ANAYZA TRIBES, THEY UNDERSTOOD THE WILL 
OF THE TRIBES AND GOT WORD TO ABDULLAH THAT HE WOULD REMAIN IN 
COMMAND OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. 
 
7.   (C) COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH SELF-GRATIFYING AND NO DOUBT 
EXAGGERATED--IF NOT ALTOGETHER APOCRYPHAL--THE STATISTICS AND STORY 
HIGHLIGHT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE TRIBESMEN BELIEVE THAT A 
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BINDS ABDULLAH AND THE TRIBES AND THAT HE IS 
THEIR MAN IN THE GOVERNMENT.  REFTEL DESCRIBES THE GENERAL 
IMPORTANCE OF TRIBAL SUPPORT TO THE AL SAUD.  END COMMENT.

(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM ALBERT THIBAULT, REASON 1.5 B. 
 
1.  (S) THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON EX-SAUDI TERRORIST USAMA BIN 
LADIN, WHICH INCLUDES INPUT FROM CONSULATES DHAHRAN AND JEDDAH, 
IS KEYED TO QUESTIONS POSED IN REF A. 
 
A.   (S)  ISLAMIC LEADERS ADMIRED BY BIN LADIN: 
 
BIN LADIN WAS RAISED IN A CONSERVATIVE WAHHABI MUSLIM FAMILY. 
AS A YOUNG MAN HE REPORTEDLY WAS INFLUENCED BY CONSERVATIVE, NEO- 
SALAFI PREACHER MUHAMMAD BIN SALIH AL-UTHAYMIN, IMAM OF THE GRAND 
MOSQUE IN UNAYZAH AND A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF SENIOR ULAMA. 
DURING HIS YEARS IN AFGHANISTAN, HE DEVELOPED LINKS WITH MEMBERS 
OF THE EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD AND AL-GAMA\'AH AL-ISLAMIYYA 
MOVEMENTS, GROUPS INFLUENCED BY THE WORK OF EGYPTIAN MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD THINKER SAYYID QUTB.  UPON HIS RETURN FROM 
AFGHANISTAN, BIN LADIN WAS TAKEN WITH THE PREACHING OF THE SAUDI 
\"AWAKENING MOVEMENT\" PREACHERS, ESPECIALLY SAFAR AL-HAWALI AND 
SALMAN AL-AWDAH, ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT HAVE MUCH DIRECT CONTACT 
WITH THEM SINCE HE LIVED OUTSIDE OF SAUDI ARABIA AFTER 1991. 
LIKE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SAUDI RELIGIOUS LEADER MUHAMMAD IBN ABD 
AL-WAHHAB, THESE PREACHERS ARE STRICT INTERPRETERS OF THE 
TEACHINGS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY HANBALI THEOLOGIAN IBN 
TAYMIYYA, KNOWN FOR HIS LITERALISM IN INTERPRETING THE QUR\'AN, 
OPPOSITION TO INNOVATION, AND VIEW THAT CHRISTIANS AND JEWS 
DISTORTED THEIR SACRED BOOKS.  BIN LADIN FREQUENTLY QUOTES IBN 
TAYMIYYA, ESPECIALLY WHEN JUSTIFYING THE NEED TO FIGHT HERESY IN 
THE ISLAMIC WORLD. 
 
IN A MARCH 1997 INTERVIEW WITH A PAKISTANI JOURNALIST WHO VISITED 
HIS CAMP IN AFGHANISTAN, BIN LADIN WAS ASKED \"WHO IS YOUR IDEAL 
PERSONALITY, IN TODAY\'S WORLD?\"  BIN LADIN RESPONDED, \"SHAYKH 
SALMAN AL-AWDAH WOULD BE MY IDEAL.\"  SALMAN AL-AWDAH, WHO REMAINS 
IMPRISONED AND REPORTEDLY IS IN FAILING HEALTH, ARGUES THAT THE 
MUSLIM \"UMMAH\" (NATION) IS IN A STATE OF CRISIS THAT REQUIRES ALL 
MUSLIMS TO TAKE UP AN ARMED STRUGGLE TO SAVE IT.  IN A TAPE 
SMUGGLED FROM PRISON IN 1995, HE DECLARED:  \"THE ISLAMIC WORLD 
TODAY, I SAY IT FRANKLY TO EVERY FRIEND AND FOE, ...IS 
TRANSFORMING INTO A FACTORY: A BUSY FACTORY TO PREPARE THE 
FIGHTERS.  THE ONE WHO WILL NOT FIGHT OUT OF FAITH AND 
ENTHUSIASM, YOU WILL FIND HIM COMPELLED TO FIGHT FOR HIS OWN 
SURVIVAL BECAUSE HE HAS NO OTHER WAY.  ... IT IS DEATH THAT GIVES 
LIFE, YES, IT IS JIHAD FOR THE SAKE OF ALLAH, THE OBLIGED FATE OF 
THIS UMMAH.  OTHERWISE IT IS EXTINCTION.  IF THE UMMAH ABANDONED 
JIHAD AND IGNORED IT, THEN ALLAH WILL HIT IT AND PUNISH IT BY 
MAKING IT LOW AMONG THE NATIONS, LIKE THE PROPHET... SAID: IF YOU 
ABANDONED JIHAD, AND BECAME SATISFIED WITH GROWING PLANTS, THEN 
ALLAH WILL CAUSE YOU TO BECOME LOW AMONG THE NATIONS, AND YOU 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COME OUT OF IT UNTIL YOU RETURN TO YOUR 
RELIGION AND DECLARE JIHAD FOR THE SAKE OF ALLAH.\" 
 
MORE RECENTLY BIN LADIN ALSO SPOKE ADMIRINGLY ABOUT A SERMON BY A 
FORMER IMAM OF THE PROPHET\'S MOSQUE IQMADINAH, SHAYKH ALI ABD 
AL-RAHMAN AL-HUTHAYFI.  DURING RAFSANJANI\'S VISIT TO THE 
PROPHET\'S MOSQUE IN FEBRUARY 1998, AL-HUTHAYFI VIRULENTLY 
ATTACKED SHIAS, PROCLAIMED THAT THERE COULD BE NO ACCOMMODATION 
BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND OTHER \"UNBELIEVERS,\" AND 
CRITICIZED THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IN THE GULF REGION. 
 
B.  (S)  DOES BIN LADIN CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE A RELIGIOUS 
LEADER? 
 
WHILE ONLY BIN LADIN HIMSELF CAN DEFINITIVELY ANSWER THIS 
QUESTION, IT WOULD APPEAR FROM HIS STATEMENTS THAT BIN LADIN DOES 
NOT CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE A RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR OR IMAM.  HE 
PRESENTS HIMSELF AS A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS AND COMMITTED \"MUJAHID\" 
(JIHAD WARRIOR) FIGHTING TO DEFEND THE ISLAMIC \"UMMAH\" FROM 
HEREQAND THE THREAT  HE BELIEVES IS POSED BY THE UNITED STATES, 
ISRAEL, AND THEIR  ALLIES. 
 
C.  (S) RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS: 
 
USAMA BIN LADIN DOES NOT HAVE CONVENTIONAL ISLAMIC CREDENTIALS. 
THAT IS TO SAY, HE DID NOT PURSUE FORMAL ISLAMIC STUDIES IN ANY 
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION OR EVEN INDEPENDENTLY UNDER A RELIGIOUS 
SCHOLAR.  HE IS HOWEVER, A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN WHO IS MORE 
INTERESTED IN ACTION THAN IN CONTEMPLATION.   AS FAR AS WE CAN 
DISCERN (NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT A POLL AMONG HIS 
FOLLOWERS), HE IS VIEWED BY HIS FOLLOWERS NOT AS A RELIGIOUS 
LEADER BUT AS A MUSLIM WARRIOR LEADING THE FIGHT TO PROTECT AND 
DEFEND THE ISLAMIC \"UMMAH.\"  EVEN MANY SAUDIS WHO BELIEVE HE IS 
MISGUIDED ACKNOWLEDGE HIS RELIGIOUS FERVOR; MANY WHO DEPLORE HIS 
CALL FOR VIOLENCE NEVERTHELESS SEE HIS REACTION TO U.S. POLICIES, 
ESPECIALLY ITS SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AS \"UNDERSTANDABLE.\" 
 
D.  (S) DOES BIN LADIN CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE THE LEADER OR 
MERELY ONE OF MANY LEADERS OF A WORLDWIDE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT? 
 
IN STATEMENTS MADE FOR WESTERN CONSUMPTION, BIN LADIN HAS BEEN AT 
PAINS TO EMPHASIZE THAT DESPITE HIS ISOLATION IN AFGHANISTAN, HE 
IS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC MOVEMENT. 
 
E.  (S) BIN LADIN\'S OBJECTIVES: 
 
BIN LADIN\'S IMMEDIATE STATED OBJECTIVE IS THE EXPULSION OF U.S. 
TROOPS FROM SAUDI ARABIA, THE ARABIAN PENINSULA, AND ALL MUSLIM 
COUNTRIES.  BEYOND THAT GOAL, IN MARCH 1997, BIN LADIN TOLD A 
PAKISTANI JOURNALIST THAT \"MUSLIMS NEED A LEADER WHO CAN UNITE 
THEM AND ESTABLISH A GOVERNMENT WHICH FOLLOWS THE RULE OF THE 
CALIPHS.  THE RULE OF THE CALIPHS WILL BEGIN FROM AFGHANISTAN. 
IT WILL ADOPT INTEREST-FREE BANKING.  THE RULE OF ALLAH WILL BE 
ESTABLISHED.  WE ARE AGAINST COMMUNISM BUT WE ARE ALSO AGAINST 
CAPITALISM.  THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH IN JUST A FEW HANDS IS 
UNISLAMIC.\"  HE DOES NOT SPECIFY WHO IS QUALIFIED TO BECOME A 
CALIPH, OR HOW HIS MOVEMENT WILL SPREAD FROM AFGHANISTAN TO THE 
REST OF THE MUSLIM WORLD.  BIN LADIN\'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS TEND TO 
BE MORE EXHORTATORY THAN PRESCRIPTIVE IN NATURE; HE SPEAKS AS A 
WARRIOR URGING HIS FOLLOWERS TO RISE UP AGAINST THE UNITED STATES 
AND OTHER ENEMIES OF ISLAM AND NOT AS A REVOLUTIONARY WITH A 
PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE.  IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR, 
FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER HE SEEKS A COMPLETE OVERTHROW OF THE 
MONARCHY IN SAUDI ARABIA.  HE HAS CHARGED THE KING AND OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE AL SAUD WITH HERESY, BUT HAS ALSO SAID THAT \"MANY 
PRINCES SHARE THE PUBLIC\'S CONCERN AND PRIVATELY VOICE OPPOSITION 
TO WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF TERROR, 
REPRESSION, AND CORRUPTION,\" IMPLYING, PERHAPS, THAT ONE OF THEM 
MIGHT BE QUALIFIED TO RULE.  BIN LADIN\'S FIXATION WITH EXPELLING 
JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND OTHER UNBELIEVERS FROM MUSLIM LANDS SUGGESTS 
THAT HE BELIEVES THAT ONCE THEY ARE GONE, ALL PROBLEMS FACED BY 
THE MUSLIM \"UMMAH\" WILL DISAPPEAR. 
 
F.  (S) TIES WITH HIS FAMILY: 
 
MEMBERS OF BIN LADIN\'S FAMILY HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY HAVE NOT HAD 
CONTACTS WITH HIM SINCE 1996, WHEN BIN LADIN SENT HIS HALF- 
BROTHER BAKR WORD THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO RETURN TO SAUDI 
ARABIA IF HIS FAMILY WOULD SECURE THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN 
POLITICAL PRISONERS.  THE FAMILY REFUSED.  THE BIN LADIN FAMILY\'S 
CONTINUED STRONG TIES WITH THE KING AND OTHER ROYAL FAMILY 
MEMBERS ARE GOOD INDICATORS THAT THERE IS PROBABLY VERY LITTLE 
CONTACT WITH USAMA.  FROM TIME TO TIME INDIVIDUAL BROTHERS HAVE 
CONTACTED USAMA IN FUTILE EFFORTS TO PERSUADE HIM TO GIVE UP HIS 
WAYS AND RETURN TO THE KINGDOM.  HOWEVER, BY NOW THE FAMILY HAS 
LARGELY GIVEN UP ON HIM.  AS ONE OF HIS BROTHERS CONFIDED TO AN 
EMBOFF LATE LAST YEAR, \"AS FAR AS THE FAMILY IS CONCERNED, USAMA 
IS DEAD, AND IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF HE WERE KILLED.\" 
 
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, BUSINESSMEN IN PROMINENT JEDDAH 
MERCHANT FAMILIES CONCEDE THAT WHILE THE BIN LADIN FAMILY HAS 
DISAVOWED USAMA, BLOOD TIES CANNOT BE ENTIRELY DENIED, AND THEY 
HAVE MENTIONED HIS CONNECTIONS WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS WHO 
LIVE IN JEDDAH.  JAMAL KHASHOGGI, AN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT SPECIALIST 
FOR \"AL-HAYAT\" NEWSPAPER, TOLD US RECENTLY THAT USAMA\'S SON 
ABDALLAH LIVES IN JEDDAH, BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUSPECT 
USAMA\'S RELATIVES OF HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH TERRORISM. 
 
ANOTHER ONE OF USAMA\'S ELDER BROTHERS, YAHYA BIN LADIN, RECENTLY 
TOLD CONSULATE JEDDAH CONTACTS THAT HE FELT HE HAD MADE TWO 
STRATEGIC MISTAKES WITH RESPECT TO HIS YOUNGER SIBLING.  FIRST, 
HE HAD NOT OFFERED HIM A POSITION IN THE FAMILY COMPANY, AND 
SECOND, HE DID NOT GO TO SUDAN FOUR YEARS AGO TO PERSUADE USAMA 
TO COME BACK TO SAUDI ARABIA BEFORE HE \"TURNED AWAY FROM THE 
FOLD.\"  ANOTHER CONTACT, A SAUDI ISLAMIC MOVEMENT SPECIALIST WHO 
HAS LONG KNOWN USAMA, CLAIMS USAMA NOW HAS NOT MORE THAN 50 
PEOPLE AROUND HIM. 
 
G.  (S) RELATIONS WITH OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS AND RELATIONS WITH 
SHIA DISSIDENTS: 
 
WHILE BIN LADIN HAS ATTEMPTED TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS ONE MEMBER IN 
A WORLDWIDE ALLIANCE OF MUSLIM ORGANIZATIONS, A LOOK AT WHICH 
ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY COOPERATE WITH HIM REVEALS THAT HIS 
NETWORK IS PROBABLY NOT AS BROAD AS BIN LADIN WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
US THINK.  SINCE HIS EARLY DAYS IN AFGHANISTAN, HE HAS HAD LINKS 
WITH MEMBERS OF THE EGYPTIAN AL-GAMA\'AH AL-ISLAMIYYA (RIFA\'I 
AHMAD TAHA, \"AMIR\" OF THE GROUP, AND MUHAMMAD SHAWQI AL-ISLAMBULI 
AND MUSTAFA HAMZAH (AKA ABU-HAZIM) HAVE REPORTEDLY BEEN LIVING IN 
AFGHANISTAN WITH BIN LADIN) AND THE ISLAMIC JIHAD (AYMAN AL- 
ZAWAHIRI, THE EGYPTIAN JIHAD \"AMIR,\" IS REPORTEDLY HIS CLOSEST 
ASSOCIATE.)   DURING THE AFGHANISTAN WAR, BIN LADIN COLLABORATED 
CLOSELY WITH THE LATE PALESTINIAN ISLAMIST ABDALLAH AZZAM IN 
SETTING UP THE \"JIHAD AND RELIEF\" GUEST HOUSE IN PESHAWAR TO 
RECEIVE MUJAHIDEEN VOLUNTEERS ON THEIR WAY TO AFGHANISTAN. 
DURING THIS TIME, IN ADDITION TO FINANCING RECRUITMENT, TRAINING 
AND SUPPORT OF THE ARAB VOLUNTEERS, BIN LADIN IS SAID TO HAVE 
PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR GROUPS SUCH AS HAMAS AND THE YEMENI ISLAMIC 
JIHAD GROUP HEADED BY SHAYKH ZINDANI.  DURING HIS TIME IN SUDAN, 
BIN LADIN, AS A GUEST OF HASAN TURABI, IS SAID TO HAVE DEVELOPED 
LINKS WITH THE ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT IN ALGERIA.  SINCE THEN 
BIN LADIN HAS BEEN A BENEFACTOR TO ISLAMIC MILITANT GROUPS IN 
PAKISTAN, TAJIKISTAN, BOSNIA AND JORDAN.  HIS ROLE VIS A VIS MOST 
OF THESE GROUPS, HOWEVER, APPEARS TO BE LIMITED TO THAT OF 
FINANCIER AND SUPPORTER; HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE FORGING A 
WORLDWIDE ALLIANCE BETWEEN THESE QUITE DISPARATE GROUPS.  THE SO- 
CALLED FATWA URGING MUSLIMS TO \"KILL AMERICANS EVERYWHERE\" ISSUED 
IN FEBRUARY 1998 WAS SIGNED ONLY BY AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI OF THE 
EGYPTIAN JIHAD, RIFA\'I AHMAD TAHA OF THE AL-GAMA\'AH AL-ISLAMIYYA, 
SHAYKH MIR HAMZA, SECRETARY OF THE JAMIAT-UL-ULAMA-E-PAKISTAN, 
AND FAZLUL RAHMAN, AMIR OF THE JIHAD MOVEMENT IN BANGLADESH. 
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE JAMIAT-UL-ULAMA-E-PAKISTAN SUBSEQUENTLY 
DISAVOWED ANY LINKS WITH BIN LADIN. THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS THAT 
AL-GAMA\'AH AL-ISLAMIYYA HAVE DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM BIN LADIN. 
 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT BIN LADIN HAS LINKS WITH SHIA 
DISSIDENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA, AND WE SUSPECT THAT, GIVEN THE 
THEOLOGICAL SCHISMS BETWEEN THE SAUDI SUNNI RADICALS AND THE 
SHIA, BIN LADIN WOULD NOT BE INCLINED TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH 
THEM.  BIN LADIN\'S APPLAUSE FOR FORMER MEDINA IMAM AL-HUTHAYFI\'S 
VERY PUBLIC INSULT OF IRANIAN EX-PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI IS LIKELY A 
GOOD INDICATOR OF HIS THINKING ON RELATIONS WITH THE SHIA IN 
SAUDI ARABIA AND IN IRAN.  SHIA IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE VIEW BIN 
LADIN AND HIS IDEOLOGY AS ANTI-SHIA. 
 
H.  (S)  CONTACTS WITH NON-MUSLIM (INCLUDING SECULAR) GROUPS 
OPPOSED TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE WEST: 
 
WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SUCH CONTACTS, AND GIVEN BIN LADIN\'S 
FANATICISM AND INTENSE INTOLERANCE OF NON-MUSLIMS, WE DOUBT THAT 
HE IS INTERESTED IN MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH NON-MUSLIMS. 
 
I.  (S) SYMPATHY TOWARDS BIN LADIN IN SAUDI INSTITUTIONS: 
 
EMBASSY IS UNABLE TO CONDUCT SURVEYS TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF 
SYMPATHY TOWARDS BIN LADIN IN VARIOUS SAUDI INSTITUTIONS AND 
CONSTITUENCIES.  HOWEVER, BASED ON OUR CONTACTS WITH SAUDIS IN 
THESE INSTITUTIONS, EMBASSY PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT OF 
LIKELY SAUDI SYMPATHY FOR BIN LADIN: 
 
THE MILITARY: LOW 
 
THE NATIONAL GUARD:  LOW 
 
MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR:  LOW 
 
THE ULAMA: HIGH IN SOME QUARTERS, I.E., AMONG NEO-SALAFIS, BUT 
NOT AMONG THE MAINSTREAM IMAMS. 
 
THE ROYAL DIWAN: LOW. IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY\'S 
MINIONS ARE INTERESTED IN BITING THE HANDS THAT FEED THEM. 
 
THE MAJLIS AL-SHURA:  LOW, ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE CONSERVATIVE 
RELIGIOUS MEMBERS WERE SYMPATHETIC TO CALLS BY THE AWAKENING 
MOVEMENT FOR A STRICTER APPLICATION OF SHARIA LAW. 
 
ACADEMIA:  MEDIUM; SYMPATHY, IF NOT AGREEMENT WITH BIN LADIN\'S 
METHODS, MAY BE HIGHER AMONG CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC SCHOLARS IN 
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS IMAM MUHAMMAD BIN SAUD UNIVERSITY, WHOSE 
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT AND OTHER 
OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES.  UNIVERSITY FACULTY ALSO INCLUDE WESTERN 
EDUCATED LIBERALS WHOSE SYMPATHY IS LOW. 
 
ARAB EXPATRIATES:  LOW, ALTHOUGH POSSIBLY HIGHER AMONG YEMENIS 
AND SUDANESE. 
 
BUSINESSMEN: MIXED.  SOME SYMPATHY.  IN GENERAL, JEDDAH MERCHANT 
FAMILIES, MANY OF WHOSE MEMBERS KNOW USAMA FROM HIS YOUNGER DAYS, 
HAVE EMPHASIZED TO US THAT THE U.S. MEDIA IS ELEVATING USAMA AND 
GIVING HIM A POWER HE NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD OTHERWISE.  A NUMBER 
HAVE LAMENTED THAT THE STALEMATE IN THE PEACE PROCESS AND WHAT IS 
PERCEIVED AS UNLIMITED SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL REGARDLESS OF ITS 
ACTIONS HAS LED SOME SAUDIS TO BE MORE TOLERANT OF USAMA THAN 
THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BE. 
 
WOMEN: EXTREMELY LOW.  BIN LADIN AND THE CLERICS HE ADMIRES ARE 
OPPOSED TO WOMEN\'S RIGHTS; THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT SEEMS TO FIND 
FEW ADHERENTS AMONG SAUDI WOMEN. 
 
THE SAUDI PUBLIC AT LARGE:  BIN LADIN\'S CALL TO VIOLENCE IS NOT 
ONE THAT RESONATES WITH MOST SAUDIS.  THE ISLAMIC INJUNCTION 
AGAINST TAKING ACTIONS WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO \"FITNA\" (SOCIAL CHAOS) 
IS DEEPLY INGRAINED IN THIS SOCIETY.  INTERESTINGLY, OVER THE 
LAST YEAR OR SO, THE RELIGIOUS DEBATE ABOUT WHEN ISLAMIC LAW 
ALLOWS FOR REMOVAL OF A MUSLIM LEADER HAS BEEN PUBLICLY AIRED, 
SUGGESTING A REACTION TO CHARGES BY BIN LADIN AND OPPOSITION 
MEMBERS THAT THE KING AND THE AL SAUD HAVE UNDERTAKEN HERETICAL 
ACTS AND MUST BE REMOVED FROM POWER.  IN A LENGTHY INTERVIEW, 
MAJLIS AL-SHURA PRESIDENT AND SENIOR SCHOLAR SHAYKH BIN JUBAYR 
OPINED THAT REMOVING A RULER IS ALLOWABLE ONLY UNDER THE 
NARROWEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, AND GRAND MUFTI SHAYKH BIN BAZ ISSUED 
A FATWA REMINDING MUSLIMS THAT IN MOST INSTANCES IT IS FORBIDDEN. 
WE THINK THAT MOST SAUDIS PROBABLY AGREE. 
 
HOWEVER, BIN LADIN\'S STATEMENTS REFLECT THE FRUSTRATION THAT MANY 
MIDDLE CLASS SAUDIS FEEL ABOUT THEIR ECONOMIC SITUATION, 
FRUSTRATION THAT WILL GROW AS PER CAPITA INCOMES DECLINE.  IN A 
1996 INTERVIEW BIN LADIN CORRECTLY OBSERVED THAT SAUDIS WONDER 
\"IS OURS REALLY THE WORLD\'S LARGEST OIL EXPORTING COUNTRY?\"  IN 
ADDITION, HIS ANTIPATHY TOWARDS U.S. POLICY THAT IS SUPPORTIVE OF 
ISRAEL IS WIDELY SHARED BY MOST SAUDIS.  THERE IS A CERTAIN 
RESPECT FOR BIN LADIN AS A MAN MOTIVATED BY RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLE, 
AND, WHILE MOST SAUDIS WOULD NOT FOLLOW HIM, MANY SHARE HIS 
FRUSTRATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE RELIGIOUS 
WEEKLY, \"AL MUSLIMUN,\" WHO KNOWS USAMA, TOLD US HE RESPECTS HIM 
FOR HIS ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE WAR AGAINST THE USSR, NOTING THAT HE 
BUILT SOME USEFUL TUNNELS THROUGH THE AFGHAN MOUNTAINS.  AFTER 
THE BOMBINGS OF EMBASSIES NAIROBI AND DAR ES-SALAAM, EMBOFFS 
HEARD FROM MANY SAUDI CONTACTS WHO CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS BUT ALSO 
FELT THEY WERE INEVITABLE GIVEN WHAT THEY SEE AS AMERICA\'S 
UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT OF ISRAEL. 
 
ACCORDING TO JAMAL KHASHOGGI, AN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT SPECIALIST FOR 
\"AL HAYAT\" NEWSPAPER, FEW PEOPLE IN JEDDAH DISLIKE USAMA, AND 
SOME CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HIM BECAUSE THEY ARE FED UP WITH THE 
AMERICAN PRESENCE/POLICY IN THE REGION.  KHASHOGGI SAID THAT MANY 
PEOPLE CONSIDER USAMA BIN LADIN AS THE \"CHE GUEVARA\" OF THE ARAB 
WORLD.  HE SAID THAT SOME HOPE THAT USAMA WILL DIE IN BATTLE SO 
THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT HAVE TO SUFFER THE \"HUMILIATION\" OF SEEING 
HIM TRANSPORTED IN HANDCUFFS TO THE U.S. 
 
J.  (S) IS BIN LADIN VIEWED AS A TERRORIST OR AS AN ISLAMIC 
IDEOLOGUE? 
 
SEE ABOVE.  REACTION VARIES. 
 
K.  (S) HOW IS BIN LADIN\'S MESSAGE DISSEMINATED? 
 
THE INTERNET, INTERNATIONAL ARAB PRESS, AND SATELLITE TELEVISION 
GUARANTEE THE DISSEMINATION OF BIN LADIN\'S MESSAGES.  THE INTENSE 
FOCUS OF THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA ON BIN LADIN FOLLOWING THE 
BOMBINGS OF EMBASSIES NAIROBI AND DAR ES-SALAAM HAS ASSURED BIN 
LADIN\'S NOTORIETY AMONG EVEN THE MOST ISOLATED SAUDIS. 
INTERNATIONAL ARABIC JOURNALS SUCH AS AL-HAYAT, AL-SHARQ AL- 
AWSAT, AND AL-QUDS AL-ARABI ARE ALSO WIDELY READ HERE. 
 
L.  (S) WHAT COMMUNICATION DOES BIN LADIN HAVE WITH SAUDI 
SOCIETY? 
 
SEE ABOVE. 
 
M.  (S) SAUDI PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FUNDING OF BIN LADIN? 
 
THE SAG DOES NOT PROVIDE FUNDS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO BIN 
LADIN OR HIS FOLLOWERS THROUGH ANY ORGANIZATION.  THE SAG 
MONITORS PRIVATE SAUDI DONATIONS TO PRIVATE CHARITIES, BUT IT IS 
LIKELY THAT SOME MONEY MAKES ITS WAY TO ORGANIZATIONS WITH LINKS 
TO BIN LADIN.  FOR EXAMPLE, ACCORDING TO \"AL-HAYAT\" ISLAMIC 
MOVEMENT SPECIALIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI, JIHAD IS ONE OF THE 
LEGITIMATE USES FOR ZAKAT, THE MANDATORY ISLAMIC TAX.  SAUDI 
GRAND MUFTI SHAYKH BIN BAZ HAS ISSUED A NUMBER OF FATWAS SAYING 
THAT ZAKAT CAN BE GIVEN IN FOR JIHAD IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, 
MOST RECENTLY FOR EXAMPLE, TO SUPPORT THE \"JIHAD\" IN KASHMIR. 
BIN LADIN IS KNOWN TO HAVE LINKS WITH GROUPS IN KASHMIR. 
 
IT IS WIDELY RUMORED IN THE BUSINESS AND BANKING COMMUNITY IN 
RIYADH THAT THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF USAMA\'S MONEY WAS A $300 
MILLION SETTLEMENT HE OBTAINED WHEN HIS FAMILY BOUGHT OUT HIS 
SHARE IN THE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR BIN LADIN GROUP CONGLOMERATE. 
 
N.  (S)  STATUS OF THE BIN LADIN FAMILY FOLLOWING BOMBINGS: 
 
THE BIN LADIN FAMILY\'S STATUS HAS NOT CHANGED.  IT HAS PUBLICLY 
DISASSOCIATED ITSELF FROM USAMA, AND REMAINS CLOSELY LINKED TO 
THE ROYAL FAMILY AND HIGHLY RESPECTED IN BUSINESS CIRCLES. 
 
O.  (S)  ACCOMMODATION WITH THE AL SAUD: 
 
BIN LADIN HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT HE WOULD REACH AN 
\"ACCOMMODATION\" WITH THE AL SAUD ONLY IF THEY MET HIS CONDITIONS 
OF EXPELLING U.S. TROOPS FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND IMPLEMENTING THE 
ISLAMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS HE AND THE AWAKENING PREACHERS HAVE 
DEMANDED. 
 
P.  (S)  CONNECTIONS/OVERLAP BETWEEN BIN LADIN\'S MESSAGE AND 
MAINSTREAM SAUDI ULAMA: 
 
THERE IS NOT MUCH OVERLAP BETWEEN BIN LADIN, WHO IS A RADICAL 
ACTIVIST, AND THE \"MAINSTREAM\" ULAMA, WHOSE JOB IS TO LEGITIMIZE 
AL SAUD RULE, EXCEPT REGARDING THE ISSUE OF ISRAEL, WHERE INTENSE 
FRUSTRATION OVER LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS IS LEADING 
MANY MEMBERS OF THE ULAMA TO RECONSIDER THEIR POSITION THAT 
ACCOMMODATION WITH ISRAEL IS POSSIBLE. 
 
Q.  (S)  APPEAL OF THE ISLAMIC \"AWAKENING\" MOVEMENT: 
 
THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT\'S APPEAL REACHES BEYOND THE UNEMPLOYED AND 
THE RELIGIOUS ELITE.  A LOOK AT WHO SIGNED THE 1992 \"MEMORANDUM 
OF ADVICE\" TO KING FAHD REVEALS A COALITION OF CLERICS, ACADEMICS 
(INCLUDING WESTERN-TRAINED SCHOLARS AND SCIENTISTS), AND 
RELIGIOUS AND LEGAL SCHOLARS THROUGHOUT SAUDI ARABIA.  RIOTS IN 
BURAYDA FOLLOWING THE FIRST ARREST OF SALMAN AL-AWDAH 
DEMONSTRATED THE WIDE POPULAR FOLLOWING HE ENJOYS IN THE QASSIM 
REGION.  THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT IS IN MANY WAYS A REACTION TO THE 
IMMENSE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES --AND ATTENDANT 
DISLOCATIONS-- THAT SAUDI ARABIA HAS UNDERGONE IN THE LAST THIRTY 
YEARS.  IT IS ALSO A RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S ECONOMIC POLICY 
FAILURES, THE MILITARY  INADEQUACIES REVEALED BY THE GULF WAR, 
AND A RELIGIOUSLY-BASED EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT HAS FAILED TO TRAIN 
SAUDI YOUTH TO FUNCTION IN A MODERN ECONOMY.  IN THE FACE OF 
DECLINING STANDARDS OF LIVING, GROWING UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE 
COMPLEXITIES IMPOSED BY MODERNIZATION, THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT\'S 
SIMPLE PRESCRIPTION OF A RETURN TO CORE ISLAMIC VALUES HAS WIDE, 
AND WE BELIEVE, GROWING APPEAL, DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT\'S MASSIVE 
EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS THE MOVEMENT.  IT IS BOTH BROADER-BASED AND 
DEEPER IN ITS SUPPORT THAN BIN LADIN\'S \"AL-QA\'IDAH.\" 
 
R.  (S)  COMMUNICATIONS OF JAILED PREACHERS AL-AWDAH AND AL- 
HAWALI WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD: 
 
AS FAR AS WE ARE ABLE TO DISCERN, THE PREACHERS\' COMMUNICATIONS 
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED OF LATE.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE MANAGED TO SMUGGLE 
OUT ANY LETTERS OR TAPED MESSAGES TO THEIR SUPPORTERS IN THE LAST 
YEAR, WHEREAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR INCARCERATION, REPORTS OF 
SUCH MESSAGES APPEARED PERIODICALLY. 
 
S.  (S)  EXPECTATIONS AMONG SUPPORTERS OF AL-AWDAH AND AL-HAWALI 
THAT THE PREACHERS WILL NOT RENOUNCE THEIR BELIEFS, AND WILL BE 
RELEASED: 
 
THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY EXPECTATION THAT EITHER AL-AWDAH 
OR AL-HAWALI WILL RENOUNCE HIS BELIEFS IN EXCHANGE FOR FREEDOM. 
HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT ANOTHER FIREBRAND PREACHER, SHAYKH AYIDH AL- 
QARNI, WAS RELEASED ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER AWAKENING PREACHERS 
AND SYMPATHIZERS LAST RAMADAN (RIYADH 292), IT IS POSSIBLE THAT 
SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THEIR RELEASE MIGHT 
BE REACHED.  APPARENTLY BOTH PREACHERS ARE IN POOR HEALTH, AND IT 
IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD BE RELEASED FOR HEALTH REASONS. 
 
T.  (S)  COMMON SAUDI VIEW OF CHRISTIANS/JEWS: 
 
ACCORDING TO THE PURITANICAL AND XENOPHOBIC WAHHABI BRAND OF 
ISLAM PRACTICED IN SAUDI ARABIA, ALL NON-MUSLIMS ARE CONSIDERED 
TO BE \"UNBELIEVERS.\"  SOPHISTICATED SCHOLARS WILL EXPLAIN THAT 
THIS MEANS THAT NON-MUSLIMS ARE CONSIDERED \"UNBELIEVERS\" VIS A 
VIS THE MESSAGE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD, BUT THAT CHRISTIANS AND 
JEWS, AS \"PEOPLE OF THE BOOK,\" ARE DUE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION 
SINCE THEY WORSHIP THE SAME GOD AND FOLLOW MANY OF THE SAME 
PROPHETS.  LESS SOPHISTICATED SAUDIS TEND TO SIMPLY VIEW ALL NON- 
MUSLIMS AS UNBELIEVERS WITHOUT MAKING THIS DISTINCTION.  EDUCATED 
SAUDIS WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE WEST TEND NOT TO BE TROUBLED 
BY THIS, BUT SOME CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS SAUDIS ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT DEALING WITH NON-MUSLIMS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WONDER IF 
IT IS PROPER TO USE THE TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC GREETING, \"PEACE BE 
UPON YOU,\" WITH A NON-MUSLIM.   GROWING FRUSTRATION WITH THE 
PEACE PROCESS AND THE U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE AND THE DAMAGE TO 
IRAQI SOCIETY AS A RESULT OF EIGHT YEARS OF U.N. SANCTIONS ALSO 
COMPLICATE VIEWS OF JEWS AND CHRISTIANS; A WIDELY SHARED BELIEF 
IS THAT THE U.S. INABILITY TO PERSUADE ISRAEL TO MAKE CONCESSIONS 
IN THE PEACE PROCESS OR REMOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM POWER ARE 
ACTUALLY INTENTIONAL AND STEM FROM AN INNATE HOSTILITY TO THE 
MUSLIM WORLD.  THIS BELIEF IS SKILLFULLY EXPLOITED BY PEOPLE LIKE 
BIN LADIN. 
 
THERE IS A DEBATE AMONG SAUDI SCHOLARS ABOUT CONTACT WITH NON- 
MUSLIMS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER MUSLIMS SHOULD VISIT NON-MUSLIM 
COUNTRIES, AND WHETHER CHRISTIANS AND JEWS TODAY CAN BE 
CONSIDERED \"PEOPLE OF THE BOOK.\"   AT THE HEART OF THE DEBATE ARE 
TWO SAYINGS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD:  FIRST, \"I WILL 
MOVE THE JEWS AND THE CHRISTIANS OUT OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA AND 
I WILL LEAVE ONLY MUSLIMS IN IT.\"  AND SECOND, \"THERE CANNOT BE 
TWO RELIGIONS IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA.\"  THE FIRST IS A SAYING 
WHOSE AUTHENTICITY IS WELL-DOCUMENTED AND ACCEPTED BY MOST MUSLIM 
SCHOLARS; THE SECOND IS CONSIDERED FLAWED SINCE IT IS MISSING 
SOME OF THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR COMPLETE AUTHENTICATION. 
USAMA BIN LADIN AND THE AWAKENING PREACHERS POINT TO THE FIRST 
SAYING AS THE BASIS FOR THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE OF NON- 
MUSLIM TROOPS IN THE KINGDOM.  SOME CONSERVATIVE CLERICS SAY IT 
MEANS THAT JEWS AND CHRISTIANS DISTORTED THEIR HOLY BOOKS TO THE 
POINT THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED \"PEOPLE OF THE BOOK\" 
WORTHY OF SPECIAL TREATMENT, AND THEREFORE MUST BE REMOVED FROM 
THE KINGDOM.  SOME SCHOLARS, SUCH AS FORMER MADINAH IMAM SHAYKH 
AL-HUTHAYFI, USE THIS SAYING TO SUPPORT THEIR CONTENTION THAT 
THERE CAN BE NO ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND JEWS AND 
CHRISTIANS.  MORE TOLERANT SCHOLARS SAY THAT THIS SAYING MUST BE 
CONSIDERED IN ITS CONTEXT, THAT THE PROPHET WAS REFERRING TO 
JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN FIGHTERS AND WAS NOT REFERRING TO ALL JEWS 
AND CHRISTIANS.  THE SECOND SAYING IS WHAT MANY CONSERVATIVE 
SCHOLARS CONSIDER TO BE THE BASIS FOR THE INJUNCTION AGAINST 
PUBLIC NON-MUSLIM WORSHIP IN THE KINGDOM. 
 
U.  (S)  DOES SAG TOLERANCE OF PRIVATE NON-MUSLIM WORSHIP 
EXACERBATE ANTI-CHRISTIAN, ANTI-AMERICAN FEELINGS AMONG SAUDIS? 
 
THE SAG\'S MORE TOLERANT POLICY HAS NOT BEEN IN EFFECT FOR VERY 
LONG AND IS NOT PUBLICIZED, SO IT IS PERHAPS TOO EARLY TO 
DETERMINE IF A BACKLASH HAS DEVELOPED.  THUS FAR, EMBASSY HAS NO 
EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASE IN ANTI-CHRISTIAN OR ANTI-AMERICAN 
FEELINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SAG TOLERANCE OF PRIVATE NON-MUSLIM 
WORSHIP. 
 
V.  (S)  SHIFT IN TONE OR CONTENT OF AVERAGE FRIDAY SERMON OVER 
THE LAST FIVE YEARS: 
 
SINCE THE SAG CRACK-DOWN ON THE AWAKENING MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN IN 
1994, FRIDAY SERMONS HAVE BEEN LARGELY DE-POLITICIZED.  THE SAG\'S 
RE-ORGANIZATION OF THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT IN 1994 PUT THE 
MINISTRY OF ISLAMIC AFFAIRS IN CHARGE OF IMAMS AND THE CONTENT OF 
SERMONS, STRICTLY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF ANY PREACHER TO DO 
ANYTHING BUT TOE THE AL SAUD LINE.  POLITICAL TOPICS OCCASIONALLY 
COME UP, AS IN THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC INSULT OF FORMER IRANIAN 
PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI AT THE PROPHET\'S MOSQUE IN MADINAH, BUT 
IMAMS WHO STRAY FROM THEIR APPROVED TEXT RARELY GET A SECOND 
CHANCE.  ON THE SOCIAL FRONT, HOWEVER, IMAMS ARE GIVEN MUCH MORE 
FREEDOM, AND TOPICS SUCH AS THE ROLE OF WOMEN, TREATMENT OF 
SERVANTS, PROPER BEHAVIOR DURING RAMADAN, FOREIGN TRAVEL, 
CONTACTS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN, ETC., ARE VIGOROUSLY DEBATED FROM 
PULPITS AROUND THE COUNTRY. 
 
 
2.  (U) MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

TAGS: PTER, SA 
SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA:  1998 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  (A) STATE 202128;  (B) CAIRO 03962 
 
1.   THE FOLLOWING RESTATES AND RESPONDS TO EACH OF THE QUESTIONS 
SET FORTH IN REFTEL. 
 
A.   DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF EACH COUNTRY 
TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 1998, INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION RELATING TO TERRORISM.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE 
GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT ACTIONS REGARDING ACTS OF TERRORISM 
AGAINST OR AFFECTING U. S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG IS CONTINUING ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE KHOBAR 
TOWERS BOMB ATTACK OF JUNE 1996 WHICH KILLED 19 U. S. MILITARY 
PERSONNEL.  ALTHOUGH THE SAG REPORTEDLY HAS DETAINED AND 
INTERROGATED SAUDI CITIZENS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING, IT HAS 
NOT YET BEGUN PROSECUTION OR TAKEN ANY OTHER PUBLIC LEGAL ACTION 
REGARDING ANY SUCH PERSONS.  THERE WERE NO OTHER KNOWN TERRORIST 
CASES OR ACTIONS THAT CAME BEFORE THE JUDICIARY IN 1998. 
 
B.   DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION 
OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR? 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO 
U. S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG REQUESTED THAT CANADA DEPORT SAUDI CITIZEN HANI 
AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA IN 1997.  CANADIAN OFFICIALS DETAINED AL- 
SAYEGH IN MARCH 1997 ON CHARGES OF DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUNE 
1996 KHOBAR TOWERS BOMB ATTACK.  CANADA DEPORTED AL-SAYEGH TO THE 
UNITED STATES AFTER DOCUMENTS LINKING HIM TO SAUDI HIZBALLAH WERE 
PRESENTED TO THE COURT.  THE SAG THEN REQUESTED THAT THE USG DEPORT 
AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA TO QUESTION AND PERHAPS PROSECUTE HIM FOR 
HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING.  THE EXTRADITION 
CASE IS STILL PENDING FINAL DECISION WITH THE IMMIGRATION AND 
NATURALIZATION SERVICE (INS).  THERE HAVE BEEN MEDIA REPORTS THAT 
THE SAG HAS REQUESTED THAT THE TALEBAN GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN 
EXTRADITE SAUDI-BORN TERRORIST FINANCIER AND ORGANIZER USAMA BIN 
LADIN.  BIN LADIN, WHO WAS STRIPPED OF HIS SAUDI CITIZENSHIP IN 
1994, WAS INDICTED ON NOVEMBER 5, 1998 BY A U. S. FEDERAL GRAND 
JURY IN NEW YORK, WHICH ALLEGED THAT HE AND OTHERS ENGAGED IN AN 
INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACY TO ATTACK U. S. FACILITIES AND TO KILL 
U. S. CITIZENS INCLUDING IN NAIROBI, KENYA AND DAR ES SALAAM, 
TANZANIA ON AUGUST 7, 1998. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTS THAT SAUDI 
AUTHORITIES REQUESTED JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES TO EXTRADITE MUHAMMAD 
AL-MAQDISI, WHO IS SERVING A 15 YEAR SENTENCE IN JORDAN AND HAS 
BEEN LINKED TO THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OF USAMA BIN LADIN. 
 
C.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
RESPONSE:  NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO THE SAG\'S 
PROSECUTION OF PERSONS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED TERRORIST ACTS 
WITHIN SAUDI ARABIA.  HOWEVER, THE SAG HAS NOT ENTERED INTO 
EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE 
UNITED STATES.  (NOTE:  EXTRADITION TREATIES EXIST WITH YEMEN AND 
EGYPT AND THE ARAB LEAGUE ANTI-TERRORIST AGREEMENT (REFTEL B) HAS 
EXTRADITION ARTICLES.) 
 
D.   DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. 
THIS WOULD INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A 
TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST 
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG AT ALL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE KING, CROWN PRINCE, 
MINISTER OF INTERIOR, MINISTER OF INFORMATION, ISLAMIC ULAMA, AND 
OFFICIAL NEWS MEDIA PUBLICLY AND CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS TERRORISM IN 
UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS, INCLUDING BY MAKING ATTEMPTS TO ERADICATE 
IDEOLOGICAL/RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TERRORISM.  THE CROWN 
PRINCE IN HIS OCTOBER WORLD TOUR MADE A POINT TO CONDEMN TERRORISM 
IN ALL ITS FORMS AND TO DENY THAT TERRORISM HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH 
ISLAM.  THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING 
AND HAS SHOWN INCREASED COOPERATION IN ITS ASSISTANCE TO THE USG IN 
ITS OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE BOMBING. 
 
E.   DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1998 BY 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
RESPONSE:  INTERNALLY, THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR 
TOWERS BOMBING.  IT HAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN NUMEROUS MEASURES TO 
STRENGTHEN SECURITY PROTECTION OF U. S. MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC 
PERSONNEL, PARTICULARLY AFTER THE AUGUST BOMBINGS OF U. S. 
EMBASSIES IN EAST AFRICA AND A THREAT AGAINST U. S. FACILITIES IN 
OCTOBER.  INTERNATIONALLY, AT THE TUNIS MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF 
ARAB LEAGUE INTERIOR MINISTERS IN JANUARY, THE SAG JOINED IN THE 
UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF AN ANTI-TERRORIST COOPERATION ACCORD WHICH 
HAD BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION FOR FOUR YEARS.  THE ACCORD AIMS TO 
ENHANCE INTER-ARAB COOPERATION REGARDING EXTRADITION OF CONVICTED 
TERRORISTS, IMPROVE INFORMATION EXCHANGES ABOUT TERRORISTS\' 
WHEREABOUTS, FINANCES AND SUPPORT NETWORKS, AND STRENGTHEN CONTROLS 
ON TRAVEL AND INFILTRATION OF TERROR SUSPECTS THROUGH ARAB 
COUNTRIES.  THE ACCORD (SEE REFTEL B), SIGNED IN CAIRO ON APRIL 22, 
CONTAINS A PLEDGE NOT TO ORDER, FINANCE, OR COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, 
TO PREVENT TERRORIST CRIMES AND TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM.  THIS 
AGREEMENT WAS RATIFIED BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS IN RIYADH ON 
SEPTEMBER 28.  AT THE 66TH SESSION OF THE GCC MINISTERIAL COUNCIL 
HELD IN RIYADH IN MARCH, THE GCC MINISTERS REJECTED \"ALL FORMS OF 
VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM WHEREVER THEY COME FROM.\"  AT A DOHA MEETING 
OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ISLAMIC CONFERENCE (OIC) MINISTERS, ALSO 
IN MARCH,  THE MEMBERS URGED ISLAMIC COUNTRIES TO CONDEMN TERRORISM 
IN ALL OF ITS ASPECTS, NOT TO PROVIDE SANCTUARY FOR TERRORISTS, AND 
TO HELP BRING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE.  THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR 
CALLED ON MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND U. N. MEMBER STATES TO REACH AN 
ANTI-TERRORISM ACCORD SIMILAR TO THE ONE SIGNED BY ARAB LEAGUE 
NATIONS IN APRIL.  FINALLY, AT THE UNGA 53RD SESSION IN SEPTEMBER, 
THE SAUDI ASSISTANT FOREIGN MINISTER REJECTED ANY LINK BETWEEN THE 
RELIGION OF ISLAM AND TERRORISM, AND STATED THAT \"THE KINGDOM 
REJECTS VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM IN ANY FORM OR SHAPE.\"  HE CALLED 
FOR INTERNATIONAL ACTIONS THROUGH THE U. N. TO BRING ABOUT THE 
TERMINATION OF TERRORISM AND CALLED FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
TO FIGHT THE SHELTERING OF TERRORISTS. 
 
F.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS, INCLUDING 
(BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS 
OR THEIR ACTIVITIES; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC 
RECOGNITION; MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC 
PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; PROVISION OF SANCTUARY AND/OR 
PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF TERRORIST GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING OR 
TRAINING SITES; PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON 
TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG DOES NOT FINANCIALLY SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR ACTIVITIES.  ITS REGULATIONS REQUIRE 
THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY AGENCIES 
OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR 
DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT 
THIS IS ENFORCED CONSISTENTLY.  NONETHELESS, THERE CONTINUE TO BE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
REPRESENTATIVES SOLICIT AND COLLECT PRIVATE FUNDS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
THE SAG CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS TERRORISM.  HOWEVER, SHEIKH AHMAD 
YASIN, THE FOUNDER OF HAMAS, VISITED SAUDI ARABIA FOR HAJJ AND 
MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND MET CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH IN APRIL. 
 
G.   HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT 
OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE SEVEN 
GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY AS STATE SPONSORS OF 
TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, AND 
SUDAN.) 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG DID NOT MAKE ANY OFFICIAL PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
SUPPORTING ANY OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S TERRORISM LIST 
REGARDING A TERRORIST ISSUE.  HOWEVER, THE SAG ALLOWED A LIBYAN 
AIRCRAFT CARRYING 105 HAJJ PILGRIMS TO LAND AT JEDDAH\'S 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ON MARCH 29 AND TO DEPART THE SAME DAY, IN 
VIOLATION OF UNSC SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON LIBYA. 
 
H.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1997, POSITIVE OR 
NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? 
 
RESPONSE:  THE AUGUST 1998 BOMBING OF U. S. EMBASSIES IN DAR ES 
SALAAM AND NAIROBI FURTHER HEIGHTENED AWARENESS AND CONCERN ABOUT 
ATTEMPTS THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN SAUDI ARABIA, FOLLOWING THE 1995 AND 
1996 ATTACKS AGAINST U. S. TARGETS.  ALL OF THESE ATTACKS MET WITH 
OFFICIAL CONDEMNATION, AND HAVE SPURRED GREATER COOPERATION AMONG 
SAUDI SECURITY ORGANS IN ADDRESSING INTERNAL SECURITY ISSUES.  THE 
SAG HAS SUBSTANTIALLY INTENSIFIED ITS DIALOGUE WITH GCC AND OTHER 
ARAB AND ISLAMIC COUNTRIES ON COMBATING TERRORISM.  THE SAUDI ANTI- 
TERRORISM STANCE WAS GIVEN A WORLD-WIDE STAGE DURING THE CROWN 
PRINCE\'S MONTH-LONG VISIT TO EUROPE, THE U. S., AND ASIA.  THE 
SAUDI GOVERNMENT REMAINS CONCERNED WITH A CONTINUED TERRORIST 
PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN, ESPECIALLY THOSE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF 
USAMA BIN LADIN, A TERRORIST FINANCIER AND ORGANIZER OF SAUDI 
ORIGIN, AND DOWNGRADED ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TALEBAN GOVERNMENT 
IN SEPTEMBER.  BIN LADIN WAS INDICTED IN NEW YORK IN NOVEMBER FOR 
PROMOTING TERRORISM. 
 
I.  DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH 
RESPECT TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
SPECIFIC U.S. REQUESTS TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT FOR COOPERATION AND 
EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES IN THE HOST COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO TERRORIST GROUPS 
DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.  DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF 
THE HOST COUNTRY\'S COOPERATION WITH THOSE EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES, 
INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS SATISFIED THE 
SPECIFIC REQUESTS. 
 
RESPONSE:  BEGINNING WITH THE 1996 VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA OF A USG 
INTERAGENCY COUNTERTERRORISM TEAM FOLLOWING THE 1995 OPM/SANG 
BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG ENTERED INTO UNPRECEDENTED, 
COORDINATED, INTERAGENCY CONSULTATIONS ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND 
SECURITY ISSUES WHICH ENGENDERED HIGH-LEVEL SAG INTEREST AND THE 
PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE SAG MINISTRIES.  THIS INTEREST AND 
PARTICIPATION HAS CONTINUED AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THROUGHOUT 
1998.  THE USG AND SAG EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND 
SECURITY ISSUES AFFECTING AMERICAN AND SAUDI INTERESTS IN THE 
REGION.  CONSULTATIONS AND TRAINING FOR SAUDI COUNTERTERRORISM AND 
SECURITY OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES ALSO OCCURRED.  FOLLOWING 
THE 1996 KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG FURTHER 
INCREASED COOPERATION.  FBI DIRECTOR LOUIS FREEH VISITED SAUDI 
ARABIA TWICE IN 1996 TO COORDINATE INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS WITH SAUDI 
INTERIOR MINISTER PRINCE NAIF.  THE FBI MAINTAINS A PERMANENTLY 
STAFFED LEGAL ATTACHE OFFICE IN THE U. S. EMBASSY.  WHILE 
COOPERATION THROUGHOUT 1998 ON THE KHOBAR TOWERS INVESTIGATION WAS 
STRONG, FOLLOWING THE EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS IN AUGUST IT WAS 
INCREASED FURTHER. 
 
J.   IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL INFORMATION, IF THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM THE HOST GOVERNMENT DURING 
THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN 
ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS OR 
INTERESTS, PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: 
 
     (I)  THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN APPREHENDING, 
CONVICTING, AND PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE ACT; AND 
 
     (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING IN PREVENTING FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED 
STATES CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
RESPONSE:  (I) THE SAG HAS SOUGHT TO APPREHEND, CONVICT, AND PUNISH 
THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH THE OPM/SANG AND KHOBAR TOWERS 
BOMBINGS AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS.  IN THIS REGARD, ON APRIL 
22, 1996 FOUR SAUDI NATIONALS PUBLICLY CONFESSED TO COMMITTING THE 
OPM/SANG BOMBING OF NOVEMBER 1995 AND THEY WERE EXECUTED ON MAY 31. 
THE SAG HAS COOPERATED WITH THE USG, ALTHOUGH EARLIER STAGES OF THE 
RELATIONSHIP DID NOT ALWAYS MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF USG OFFICIALS. 
SAUDI OFFICIALS AND THE FBI HAVE WORKED CLOSELY ON MANY 
INVESTIGATION ISSUES RELATED TO BOTH BOMBINGS AND CONTINUE TO 
CONSULT CLOSELY ON THE STATUS OF THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING 
INVESTIGATION. 
 
          (II) THE SAG HAS DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE HUMAN AND FINANCIAL 
RESOURCES TO PROTECT USG PERSONNEL AND INTERESTS FOLLOWING THE 
OPM/SANG, KHOBAR TOWERS, AND EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS.  IT MADE 
AVAILABLE TO COALITION FORCES THE PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE AT AL 
KHARJ, WHERE MOST U. S. SERVICEMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE NOW LOCATED, 
AND A VERY LARGE RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND, KNOWN AS ESKAN VILLAGE, 
SOUTH OF RIYADH FOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DOD PERSONNEL.  THE SAG 
SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FACILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
IMPROVEMENTS.  THE SAG ALSO WORKED WITH AMERICAN SECURITY PERSONNEL 
TO ENHANCE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AT ALL OTHER USG FACILITIES IN SAUDI 
ARABIA, INCLUDING THE U. S. EMBASSY IN RIYADH AND THE CONSULATES 
GENERAL IN JEDDAH AND DHAHRAN.  USG AND SAG OFFICIALS FROM THE 
HIGHEST LEVELS DOWN CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY TO REVIEW THE SAFETY 
OF AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
K.   IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION DURING 
THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U. S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE 
DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES 
CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAG HAS PROVIDED TO THE USG INFORMATION ON THREATS 
DIRECTED AT U. S. INTERESTS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND CONTINUES TO LIAISE 
CLOSELY WITH USG AGENCIES TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST 
AMERICANS IN THE KINGDOM.  THREATS HAVE REGULARLY LED TO THE RAPID 
DEPLOYMENT OF EXTRA SECURITY PERSONNEL AND THE PLACEMENT OF 
PERMANENT PHYSICAL BARRIERS, CHECKPOINTS, AND OTHER VISIBLE 
DETERRENTS.

1.   THE FOLLOWING RESTATES AND RESPONDS TO EACH OF THE QUESTIONS 
SET FORTH IN REFTEL. 
 
A.   DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF EACH COUNTRY 
TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 1999, INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE 
GIVEN TO HOST COUNTRY ACTIONS REGARDING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST 
OR AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG CONTINUES ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE KHOBAR TOWERS 
BOMB ATTACK OF JUNE 1996 WHICH KILLED 19 U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL. 
THE SAG HAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT IT IS STILL LOOKING FOR THREE 
SAUDI SUSPECTS LINKED TO THE BOMBING.  THE THREE ARE WANTED FOR 
QUESTIONING AND ARE BELIEVED TO BE OUTSIDE OF THE KINGDOM.  THE SAG 
IS STILL HOLDING A NUMBER OF SAUDI CITIZENS IN DETENTION IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING.  NO PROSECUTION OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC 
LEGAL ACTION BEGAN IN 1999 REGARDING ANY SUSPECTS INVOLVED IN THE 
BOMBING.  THERE WERE NO OTHER KNOWN TERRORIST CASES OR ACTIONS THAT 
CAME BEFORE THE JUDICIARY IN 1999. 
 
B.   DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION 
OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR? 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO 
U.S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG REQUESTED THAT CANADA DEPORT SAUDI CITIZEN HANI 
AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA IN 1997.  CANADIAN OFFICIALS DETAINED AL- 
SAYEGH IN MARCH 1997 ON CHARGES OF DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUNE 
1996 KHOBAR TOWERS BOMB ATTACK.  CANADA DEPORTED AL-SAYEGH TO THE 
UNITED STATES AFTER DOCUMENTS LINKING HIM TO SAUDI HIZBOLLAH WERE 
PRESENTED TO THE COURT.  THE SAG THEN REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF 
AL-SAYEGH FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.  FOLLOWING A LENGTHY 
PERIOD OF REVIEW, HEARINGS BEFORE AN IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION 
(INS) JUDGE, AND SEVERAL APPEALS TO FEDERAL COURTS IN 1999, THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FINALIZED THE EXTRADITION CASE IN LATE 
SEPTEMBER AND THE U.S. DEPORTED AL-SAYEGH TO SAUDI ARABIA ON 
OCTOBER 11, 1999.  THERE HAVE BEEN MEDIA REPORTS THAT THE SAG HAS 
REQUESTED THAT THE TALEBAN GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN EXTRADITE 
SAUDI-BORN TERRORIST FINANCIER AND ORGANIZER USAMA BIN LADEN.  BIN 
LADEN, WHO WAS STRIPPED OF HIS SAUDI CITIZENSHIP IN 1994, WAS 
INDICTED ON NOVEMBER 5, 1998 BY A U.S. FEDERAL GRAND JURY IN NEW 
YORK, WHICH ALLEGED THAT HE AND OTHERS ENGAGED IN AN INTERNATIONAL 
CONSPIRACY TO ATTACK U.S. FACILITIES AND TO KILL U.S. CITIZENS 
INCLUDING IN NAIROBI, KENYA AND DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA ON AUGUST 
7, 1998.  SAG OFFICIALS HAVE DENIED THE REPORTS OF THE EXTRADITION 
REQUEST. 
 
C.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
RESPONSE: NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO THE SAG\'S 
PROSECUTION OF PERSONS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED TERRORIST ACTS 
WITHIN SAUDI ARABIA.  HOWEVER, THE SAG HAS FEW EXTRADITION TREATIES 
OUTSIDE OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE ARAB LEAGUE AND THE LEAGUE\'S 
ANTI-TERRORIST AGREEMENT, WHICH CONTAINS EXTRADITION ARTICLES. 
 
D.   DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. 
THESE WOULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A 
TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST 
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG AT ALL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE KING, CROWN PRINCE, 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE, MINISTER OF INTERIOR, MINISTER OF INFORMATION, 
ISLAMIC ULAMA, AND OFFICIAL NEWS MEDIA PUBLICLY AND CONSISTENTLY 
CONDEMNS TERRORISM IN UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS, INCLUDING BY REFUTING 
IDEOLOGICAL/RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TERRORISM.  IN A NOVEMBER 
1999 INTERVIEW THE CROWN PRINCE AGAIN STATED THAT TERRORIST ACTIONS 
ARE UN-ISLAMIC AND CALLED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CONCERTED EFFORT TO 
WIPE OUT THE PHENOMENON OF TERRORISM.  THE SAG CONTINUES TO 
INVESTIGATE THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING AND HAS CONTINUED TO 
COOPERATE WITH THE USG IN ITS OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE BOMBING. 
 
E.   DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1999 BY 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN THE INTERNATIONAL

STRENGTHEN PROTECTION OF U.S. MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL, 
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE AUGUST 1998 BOMBINGS OF U.S. EMBASSIES IN 
EAST AFRICA, A THREAT AGAINST U.S. FACILITIES IN OCTOBER 1998, AND 
AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF DESERT FOX IN DECEMBER 1998. 
ADDITIONALLY, IN JANUARY 1998, THE SAG JOINED THE ARAB LEAGUE 
INTERIOR MINISTERS IN THE UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF AN ANTI-TERRORIST 
COOPERATION ACCORD.  THE AGREEMENT WAS RATIFIED BY THE COUNCIL OF 
INTERIOR MINISTERS IN RIYADH IN SEPTEMBER 1998.  AT A NOVEMBER 1999 
MEETING OF THE GULF COOPERATION STATES (GCC), THE INTERIOR 
MINISTERS OF MEMBER STATES, INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA, DECIDED TO FORM 
A COMMITTEE TO WORK OUT A STRATEGY TO FIGHT TERRORISM.  THE 
COMMITTEE IS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE COOPERATION AND SECURITY 
COORDINATION AMONGST MEMBER STATES AND SHOULD ENABLE MORE 
COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THREAT INFORMATION.  PRINCE SULTAN, 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE, STATED DURING HIS NOVEMBER 1999 VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON THAT SAUDI ARABIA WAS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE 
UNITED STATES TO DEFEAT TERRORISM. 
 
F.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR

(BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS 
AND THEIR ACTIVITIES; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC 
RECOGNITION; MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC 
PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; PROVISION OF SANCTUARY AND/OR THE 
PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF TERRORIST GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING OR 
TRAINING SITES; PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON 
TERRORISM IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG DOES NOT POLITICALLY OR FINANCIALLY SUPPORT 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR ACTIVITIES.  ITS 
REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE 
VOLUNTARY AGENCIES OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT 
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES.  HOWEVER, IT IS 
NOT CLEAR THAT THESE REGULATIONS ARE CONSISTENTLY ENFORCED.  THERE 
CONTINUE TO BE ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION REPRESENTATIVES SOLICIT AND COLLECT PRIVATE FUNDS IN 
SAUDI ARABIA.  THE SAG LEADERSHIP CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS TERRORISM 
AND TERRORIST ACTS AS BEING CONTRARY TO ISLAM. 
 
G.   HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT 
OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE SEVEN 
GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY AS STATE SPONSORS OF 
TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, AND 
SUDAN.) 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUPPORTING ANY OF THE 
SEVEN COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S TERRORISM LIST REGARDING A TERRORIST 
ISSUE. 
 
H.   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1998, POSITIVE OR 
NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG HAS CONTINUED TO HAVE A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF 
THE TERRORIST THREAT AFTER THE AUGUST 1998 BOMBINGS OF U.S. 
EMBASSIES IN KENYA AND TANZANIA.  IN RESPONSE TO THE EAST AFRICA 
ATTACKS, AS WELL AS THE ATTACKS ON SAUDI SOIL IN 1995 AND 1996 
AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS AND PERSONNEL, SAG OFFICIALS WORLDWIDE HAVE 
STATED THEIR DETERMINATION TO FIGHT TERRORISM.  THE SAG, AT THE 
DIRECT INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CROWN PRINCE, HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH 
THE U.S. TO ENHANCE THE SECURITY OF AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA.  THE 
SAG, IN CONCERT WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GCC, HAS FORMED AN ANTI- 
TERRORISM COMMITTEE, CALLED THE SECURITY STRATEGY COMMITTEE, AIMED 
AT COORDINATING INFORMATION AND COOPERATION AMONG MEMBER STATES. 
THE SAG IS FULLY COMPLYING WITH THE SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE U.N. 
SECURITY COUNCIL AGAINST THE TALEBAN REGIME IN AFGHANISTAN, 
INCLUDING THE TERMINATION OF ARIANA AIRLINE FLIGHTS TO JEDDAH.  THE 
SAUDIS HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED ON THE TALEBAN TO EXPEL USAMA BIN 
LADEN FROM AFGHAN TERRITORY SO THAT HE MAY BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE IN 
ANOTHER COUNTRY. 
 
I.   DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REQUESTS TO THE 
HOST GOVERNMENT FOR SPECIFIC COOPERATION AND EFFORTS BY THE UNITED 
STATES IN THE HOST COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT TO TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR 
ACTIVITIES. DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF THE HOST COUNTRY\'S COOPERATION 
WITH THOSE EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS SATISFIED THE SPECIFIC REQUESTS. 
 
RESPONSE: BEGINNING WITH THE 1996 VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA OF A USG 
INTERAGENCY COUNTERTERRORISM TEAM FOLLOWING THE 1995 OPM/SANG 
BOMBING, THE USG AND THE SAG ENTERED INTO UNPRECEDENTED, 
COORDINATED, INTERAGENCY CONSULTATIONS ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND 
SECURITY ISSUES WHICH ENGENDERED HIGH-LEVEL SAG INTEREST AND THE 
PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE SAG MINISTRIES.  THIS INTEREST AND 
PARTICIPATION HAS CONTINUED AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THROUGHOUT 
1999.  THE USG AND SAG CONTINUE TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY ISSUES AFFECTING AMERICAN AND SAUDI 
INTERESTS IN THE REGION.  CONSULTATIONS AND TRAINING FOR SAUDI 
COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES ALSO 
OCCURRED.  U.S. AND SAUDI OFFICIALS HAVE MET IN THE CONTEXT OF 
INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE TRANS-NATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT 
TO TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY.  COOPERATION BETWEEN 
THE USG AND SAG INCREASED FURTHER AFTER THE 1998 EAST AFRICA 
BOMBINGS.  THE FBI COORDINATES ITS INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS WITH THE 
MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR AND MAINTAINS A PERMANENTLY STAFFED LEGAL 
ATTACHE OFFICE IN THE U.S. EMBASSY. 
 
J.   IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL INFORMATION, IF THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM THE HOST GOVERNMENT DURING 
THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN 
ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES CITIZENS 
OR INTERESTS, PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: 
 
     (I) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES IN APPREHENDING, CONVICTING, AND 
PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACT; 
AND 
     (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING IN PREVENTING FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST THE 
UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
RESPONSE: (I)  THE SAG HAS SOUGHT TO APPREHEND, CONVICT, AND PUNISH 
THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH THE OPM/SANG AND KHOBAR TOWERS 
BOMBINGS AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS.  IN THIS REGARD, ON APRIL 
22, 1996 FOUR SAUDI NATIONALS PUBLICLY CONFESSED TO COMMITTING  THE 
OPM/SANG BOMBING OF NOVEMBER 1995.  THEY WERE EXECUTED ON MAY 31, 
1996.  THE SAG HAS COOPERATED WITH THE USG, ALTHOUGH EARLY 
COOPERATION WAS NOT AT THE LEVEL EXPECTED BY USG OFFICIALS.  SAUDI 
OFFICIALS AND THE FBI CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY ON MANY 
INVESTIGATION ISSUES RELATED TO BOTH BOMBINGS AND CONSULT CLOSELY 
WITH EACH OTHER ON THE STATUS OF THE KHOBAR BOMBING INVESTIGATION. 
SAUDI OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE USG, ESPECIALLY 
THE FBI, IN COORDINATING THE OCTOBER EXTRADITION OF HANI AL-SAYEGH 
IN ORDER TO ASSIST IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KHOBAR TOWERS 
BOMBING. 
 
          (II)  THE SAG CONTINUES TO DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE HUMAN AND 
FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECT USG PERSONNEL AND INTERESTS 
FOLLOWING THE OPM/SANG, KHOBAR TOWERS, EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS, AND A 
SPECIFIC THREAT TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IN OCTOBER 1998.  IT MADE 
AVAILABLE TO COALITION FORCES THE PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE AT AL 
KHARJ, WHERE MOST U.S. SERVICEMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE NOW LOCATED, 
AND A RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND, KNOWN AS ESKAN VILLAGE, SOUTH OF RIYADH 
FOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DOD PERSONNEL.  THE SAG SPENT MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS IN FACILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE 
SECURITY.  THE SAG ALSO WORKED WITH AMERICAN SECURITY PERSONNEL TO 
ENHANCE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AT ALL OTHER USG FACILITIES IN SAUDI 
ARABIA, INCLUDING THE U.S. EMBASSY IN RIYADH AND THE CONSULATES 
GENERAL IN JEDDAH AND DHAHRAN.  USG AND SAG OFFICIALS FROM THE 
HIGHEST LEVELS DOWN CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY TO REVIEW THE SAFETY 
OF AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
K.   IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION DURING 
THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF TERRORISM 
AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO 
WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING IN 
PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN THE 
HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG HAS PROVIDED TO THE USG INFORMATION ON THREATS 
DIRECTED AT U.S. INTERESTS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND CONTINUES TO LIAISE 
CLOSELY WITH USG AGENCIES TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST 
AMERICANS IN THE KINGDOM.  REPORTED THREATS HAVE REGULARLY LED TO 
THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF EXTRA SECURITY PERSONNEL AND THE PLACEMENT 
OF PERMANENT PHYSICAL BARRIERS, CHECKPOINTS, AND OTHER VISIBLE 
DETERRENTS.

SUBJECT:  A SAUDI RAMADAN FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM 
 
REFERENCE: (A) 98 RIYADH 04122; (B) JEDDAH 01368 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  RAMADAN IN SAUDI ARABIA THIS YEAR HAS TAKEN ON 
A CHARACTER QUITE DIFFERENT FROM RAMADANS PAST.  SAUDI 
RAMADAN IS TRADITIONALLY CHARACTERIZED BY DAYTIME INACTIVITY 
AND NIGHTTIME ENERGY, WITH SAUDIS PASSING SOMNAMBULANT DAYS 
AT WORK FOLLOWING NIGHT-LONG FLINGS OF EATING, SHOPPING AND 
VISITING RELATIVES.  DAILY WORKING HOURS IN GOVERNMENT 
OFFICES ARE OFFICIALLY REDUCED TO FROM 8 HOURS TO 5; AND, 
WHILE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO WORK, IT 
HAS BEEN LARGELY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY ARE EXCUSED FROM 
ACTUALLY WORKING.  EACH YEAR, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES 
THE REDUCTION IN WORKING HOURS FOR RAMADAN, IT IS CUSTOMARY 
FOR IT TO LIKEWISE ANNOUNCE THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS BY THE END 
OF THE FIRST WEEK OF THE MONTH.  THIS YEAR, HOWEVER, IN WHAT 
APPEARS TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO GRADUALLY CHANGE SAUDIS\' 
BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO RAMADAN, UNIVERSITIES REMAINED OPEN 
THROUGH THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THE MONTH (AND HELD EXAMS), 
AND THE GOVERNMENT ORDERED SCHOOLS TO REMAIN OPEN THROUGH THE 
FIRST THREE WEEKS OF RAMADAN (AND DIRECTED THAT MID-YEAR 
EXAMS BE ADMINISTERED DURING THIS PERIOD).  THIS CHANGE HAS 
BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF PUBLIC ACTIVITY BY 
GOVERNMENT LEADERS AND OFFICIALS, SENDING A SIGNAL THAT THE 
KINGDOM REMAINS \"OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" DESPITE ITS BEING 
RAMADAN.  THIS HAS HAD A MARKED EFFECT ON THE BEHAVIOR, AND 
MOOD, OF SAUDIS.  JUST ONE YEAR AFTER CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH 
ANNOUNCED THAT \"THE BOOM TIMES ARE OVER\" (REFTEL (A)), THE 
LEADERSHIP APPEARS TO BE USING RAMADAN TO REINFORCE ITS \"WAKE 
UP CALL\" TO THE SAUDI POPULACE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------- 
TESTED TEMPERS 
-------------- 
 
2.  THE OBSERVATION REPORTED BY AMCONGEN JEDDAH (REFTEL (B), 
PARA. 8) -- THAT THE CONTINUATION OF SCHOOLING, AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF MID-TERM EXAMS, THROUGH THE THIRD WEEK OF 
RAMADAN HAS FRAYED TEMPERS AND DISRUPTED TRADITIONAL RAMADAN 
FAMILY LIFE -- HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF CONSIDERABLE COMMENT IN 
THE SAUDI MEDIA.  THIS UNPRECEDENTED PHENOMENON HAS MEANT 
THAT THE CUSTOMARY HIGH-LEVEL OF NIGHTTIME ACTIVITY DURING 
THE MONTH HAS BEEN LARGELY REDUCED, AND REPLACED BY MORE 
NORMAL DAYTIME ACTIVITY.  EVEN CASUAL OBSERVATIONS AROUND 
RIYADH REVEAL THAT THE USUAL DENSE NIGHTTIME TRAFFIC HAS 
TAPERED OFF, FAR FEWER RECKLESS STUDENTS ARE CRUISING THE 
STREETS AIMLESSLY, AND EVEN THE LEVEL OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 
SEEMS TO HAVE DROPPED.  BECAUSE OF EXAMS, FAMILIES ARE 
COMPELLED TO STAY HOME, AND HAVE MUCH LESS TIME FOR SHOPPING, 
TO THE POINT -- APPARENTLY -- OF IMPACTING THE SAUDI RAMADAN 
TRADITION OF REPLACING THE FURNITURE IN THEIR HOUSES:  THE 
USUAL RIYADH STREET SCENE OF TRUCKS FULL OF CARPETS AND 
FURNITURE HAS BEEN LARGELY UNOBSERVED THIS YEAR. 
 
--------------------------------- 
A CONSPICUOUS LACK OF CONSUMPTION 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  THE IMPACT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION FOR SCHOOLS TO 
REMAIN OPEN HAS DRAWN MEDIA ATTENTION TO THE CHANGED CONSUMER 
BEHAVIOR THAT HAS RESULTED.  \"AL-HAYAT,\" FOR EXAMPLE, ON 
DECEMBER 25 PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE UNDER THE HEADLINE \"RETREAT 
OF RETAIL SALES IN THE KINGDOM FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 
RAMADAN.\"  THE ARTICLE NOTES THAT, DESPITE AGGRESSIVE 
PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS -- INCLUDING DISCOUNTING BY MORE THAN 
40 PERCENT, ALONG WITH FREE GIFTS AND OTHER INCENTIVES -- 
CONSUMER SPENDING IS FAR BELOW TRADITIONAL RAMADAN LEVELS; 
THE ARTICLE TIES THIS DECLINE TO THE FACT THAT MID-YEAR EXAMS 
ARE BEING HELD DURING RAMADAN.  THE \"AL-HAYAT\" ARTICLE ALSO 
NOTES THAT SAUDI MERCHANTS HAD BEEN EXPECTING THE NORMAL 250- 
TO 300-PERCENT INCREASE IN RETAIL SALES DURING RAMADAN, BUT 
THAT CURRENT ESTIMATIONS ARE FOR AN INCREASE OF NO MORE THAN 
40- TO 60-PERCENT. 
 
----------------------- 
A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER 
----------------------- 
 
4.  IN ALL RESPECTS THE CHANGES WHICH HAVE BEEN INDUCED IN 
SAUDI BEHAVIOR THROUGH THE RAMADAN SCHOOL CALENDAR HAVE BEEN 
FOR THE BETTER.  THE ABSENCE OF YOUNG SAUDI MALES CRUISING 
THE STREETS AND SHOPPING MALLS AT ALL HOURS, THE REDUCTION IN 
RECKLESS AND WASTEFUL SPENDING TYPICAL OF THE SEASON, AND THE 
RETENTION OF MORE REGULAR WORK HQITS ARE ALL POSITIVE 
DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE KINGDOM:  FOR THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC AND 
FAMILY LIFE, AND -- IN A COUNTRY WHICH ASPIRES TO ACCEDE TO 
THE WTO, AND TO \"SAUDI-IZE\" ITS ECONOMY -- FOR THE LONG-TERM 
HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY AS WELL. 
 
5.  THE MESSAGE OF \"BUSINESS AS USUAL\" -- WHILE PERHAPS MOST 
EMPHATICALLY COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE SCHOOL CALENDAR -- HAS 
BEEN CONVEYED THROUGH A VARIETY OF OTHER MEANS AS WELL. 
RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND MEDIA COMMENTATORS HAVE EMPHASIZED IN 
THEIR SERMONS AND COMMENTARIES THAT THE FASTING REQUIRED OF 
MUSLIMS DURING RAMADAN DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY SHOULD SHIRK 
THEIR WORK AND OTHER DUTIES; RATHER, A DEVOUT MUSLIM MUST 
CONTINUE HIS NORMAL COURSE OF LIFE -- AND WORK -- DURING THE 
MONTH OF RAMADAN. 
 
------------------ 
LEADING BY EXAMPLE 
------------------ 
 
6.  A COROLLARY TO THE OBSERVATIONS REGARDING BEHAVIORAL 
CHANGE INDUCED BY THE SCHOOL CALENDAR IS THE NOTICEABLE 
INCREASE IN THE LEVEL AND VISIBILITY OF PUBLIC ACTIVITY BY 
SAUDI LEADERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  WHILE, AS IS ITS 
USUAL RAMADAN CUSTOM, THE CABINET HAS MOVED ITS WEEKLY 
SESSIONS DURING RAMADAN TO NIGHTTIME, ALL INDICATIONS ARE 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS EXERTING AN EFFORT TO CONDUCT 
\"BUSINESS AS USUAL\" DURING THE MONTH.  THE MOST CONSPICUOUS 
EXAMPLE OF ACTIVE AND \"HIGH-VISIBILITY\" GOVERNMENT DURING 
RAMADAN WAS LAST WEEK\'S ROLLOUT OF THE KINGDOM\'S ANNUAL 
BUDGET, ACCOMPANIED BY CONSIDERABLE MEDIA ACCESS TO 
HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS.  MEANWHILE, KING FAHD, CROWN PRINCE 
ABDULLAH, DEFENSE MINISTER PRINCE SULTAN, AND RIYADH GOVERNOR 
PRINCE SALMAN HAVE ALL MADE SEVERAL WELL-PUBLICIZED 
APPEARANCES DURING THIS MONTH -- INAUGURATING NEW PROJECTS, 
INSPECTING GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, HOSTING VISITING FOREIGN 
LEADERS, AND ATTENDING PUBLIC EVENTS. 
 
7.  ON DECEMBER 27 ALONE, THE \"HOME\" PAGE OF THE \"RIYADH 
DAILY\" CARRIED COVERAGE OF THE MOROCCAN KING, THE BAHRAINI 
EMIR, AND THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI MEETING WITH SAUDI OFFICIALS 
(ALL IN MECCA TO PERFORM \"UMRA,\" OR THE MINOR PILGRIMAGE). 
THE SAME PAGE REPORTED ON GRAND MUFTI AL-SHEIKH RECEIVING THE 
HEAD OF THE \"DA\'WA\" (ISLAMIC CALL) CENTER IN LATIN AMERICA, 
THE SAUDI HAJJ COMMITTEE HOLDING A PLANNING MEETING, THE HEAD 
OF THE \"SHOURA COUNCIL\" RECEIVING A DELEGATION OF GCC 
CULTURAL OFFICIALS, AND THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF THE ARAB 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION FOR THE GULF STATES MEETING IN JEDDAH. 
SUCH A REPORTED LEVEL OF OFFICIAL ACTIVITY IS HIGH EVEN BY 
SAUDI NON-RAMADAN STANDARDS. 
 
------------ 
THE BACKLASH 
------------ 
 
8.  WHILE SOME SOCIETAL ELEMENTS HAVE REACTED WITH 
ACCEPTANCE, EVEN APPRECIATION OF THE \"NEW\" SAUDI APPROACH TO 
RAMADAN, RESISTANCE TO AND DISSATISFACTION WITH THIS CHANGE 
IS EVIDENT IN MANY QUARTERS.  NOT UNEXPECTEDLY, TEACHERS ARE 
AMONG THOSE WHO ARE MOST VOCAL, A FACT REFLECTED IN THE 
ANECDOTE CONVEYED IN PARA. 8 OF REFTEL (B).  \"AL-RIYADH\" 
CHIMED IN ON THIS ISSUE ON DECEMBER 23 BY PUBLISHING AN 
\"INVESTIGATIVE REPORT\" ENTITLED \"TEACHERS EXPRESS FRUSTRATION 
OVER WORKING DURING RAMADAN, AND SHOW UNEASINESS FOR 
TEACHING.\"  THE ARTICLE CITES A NUMBER OF TEACHERS 
CRITICIZING THE NEW ARRANGEMENT: 
 
-- A DEPUTY PRINCIPAL AT AN INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL, COMMENTING 
EMOTIONALLY:  \"THIS YEAR EXAMS COME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
MONTH OF RAMADAN, WHICH IN MY OPINION PREVENTS TEACHERS AND 
STUDENTS FROM OBSERVING THEIR RELIGIOUS DUTIES DURING THIS 
MONTH IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. ... (STUDIES) DISTRACT A STUDENT 
FROM PERFORMING HIS RELIGIOUS DUTIES, FROM RECITATION OF THE 
QUR\'AN, AND FROM CHARITABLE WORK DIRECTED TO THE ALMIGHTY 
DURING THIS HOLY MONTH, WHEN WE ARE REQUIRED TO DOUBLE OUR 
WORSHIP OF GOD. ... (AND) THE SAME APPLIES TO THE TEACHER. 
... YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW A TEACHER CAN ... PERFORM HIS 
RELIGIOUS DUTIES DURING THIS HOLY MONTH\"; 
 
-- A SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER EXPRESSING SIMILAR VIEWS, AND 
ARGUING FOR \"OBSERVING THE DUTIES OF THIS MONTH WITHOUT ANY 
ANNOYING OBLIGATIONS\"; 
 
-- AN INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL TEACHER STATING:  \"MOST OF THE 
TEACHERS ARE FRUSTRATED BY CONDUCTING EXAMS DURING THE MONTH 
OF RAMADAN,\" ADDING \"ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS 
TEACHERS FACE DURING THIS MONTH IS LACK OF CONCENTRATION 
AMONG STUDENTS.  THEY ARE STILL YOUNG AND FASTING AFFECTS 
THEM GREATLY...\" 
 
-- AND, FINALLY, A TEACHER WHO SUGGESTS THAT \"90 PERCENT OF 
THE TEACHERS DO NOT TEACH PROPERLY DURING RAMADAN.  IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR A TEACHER TO TEACH AN ENTIRE DAY WHILE HE IS 
FASTING.\"  THIS TEACHER CONCLUDES HIS COMMENTS BY EXPRESSING 
HIS \"HOPE FOR A RECONSIDERATION OF THIS ISSUE IN THE FUTURE,\" 
AND A RETURN TO THE STATUS QUO ANTE. 
 
---------------------- 
YOU TOOK THE WORDS ... 
---------------------- 
 
9.  SIMILAR SENTIMENTS ARE EXPRESSED IN AN ITEM IN THE 
DECEMBER 27 \"ARAB NEWS,\" UNDER THE HEADLINE \"PARENTS HAVE 
HARD TIME COPING WITH EXAMS DURING RAMADAN.\"  THE ARTICLE 
OPENS WITH THE OBSERVATION:  \"WITH SCHOOL EXAMS STRETCHING 
WELL INTO THE HOLY MONTH THIS YEAR, IT SEEMS THAT FOR MANY 
PEOPLE RAMADAN LACKS ITS USUAL SPIRITUAL ATMOSPHERE. 
CHILDREN ARE BUSY STUDYING, THEIR PARENTS ARE HELPING THEM 
DAY AND NIGHT, AND TEACHERS ARE CORRECTING PAPERS.  MANY 
READILY ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE NOT YET FELT THE SPIRITUAL 
CALMNESS THEY NORMALLY FEEL DURING THIS MONTH.\" 
 
10.  THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO GIVE VENT TO THE COMPLAINTS AND 
FRUSTRATIONS OF SEVERAL STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS, BEFORE 
CONCLUDING WITH THE COMMENT:  \"UNTIL EXAMS FINISH AT THE END 
OF THIS WEEK THE PEOPLE OF THE KINGDOM MUST ACCUSTOM 
THEMSELVES TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND CONCENTRATE ON MAKING 
THE LAST TEN DAYS OF THE MONTH A PURELY SPIRITUAL EXERCISE.\" 
THE CROWN PRINCE HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT ANY BETTER.

REF: STATE 217248 
 
1. THE FOLLOWING RESTATES AND RESPONDS TO QUESTIONS IN 
REFTEL: 
 
A)   DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF 
EACH COUNTRY TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR 
SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 2000, 
INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO 
TERRORISM.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO 
HOST COUNTRY ACTIONS REGARDING ACTS OF TERRORISM 
AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG CONTINUES ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE 
KHOBAR TOWERS BOMB ATTACK OF JUNE 1996 THAT KILLED 19 
U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL.  THE SAG HAS PUBLICLY STATED 
THAT IT IS STILL LOOKING FOR THREE SAUDI SUSPECTS 
LINKED TO THE BOMBING.  THE THREE ARE WANTED FOR 
QUESTIONING AND ARE BELIEVED TO BE OUTSIDE OF THE 
KINGDOM.  THE SAG IS STILL HOLDING A NUMBER OF SAUDI 
CITIZENS IN DETENTION IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING, 
INCLUDING SAUDI CITIZEN HANI AL-SAYEGH.  CANADIAN 
AUTHORITIES ARRESTED AL-SAYEGH IN 1997 ON CHARGES OF 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOMBING AND DEPORTED HIM TO THE 
UNITED STATES.  SAUDI AUTHORITIES THEN REQUESTED HIS 
RENDITION TO SAUDI ARABIA, AND AFTER A LENGTHY REVIEW 
THE UNITED STATES RETURNED HIM TO SAUDI ARABIA IN 
1999.  NO PROSECUTION OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC LEGAL ACTION 
BEGAN IN 2000 REGARDING THE BOMBING.  SAUDI 
AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING AN AUGUST SHOOTING BY A 
LONE SAUDI GUNMAN WHO FIRED AT CARS CARRYING AMERICAN 
AND BRITISH CITIZENS OUTSIDE OF THEIR RESIDENTIAL 
COMPOUND IN KHAMIS MUSHAYT.  A SAUDI GUARD WAS KILLED 
IN THE ATTACK, WHILE THE GUNMAN AND TWO SAUDI GUARDS 
WERE WOUNDED.  NONE OF THE AMERICANS OR BRITISH 
CITIZENS HAD SIGNIFICANT INJURIES.  SAUDI AUTHORITIES 
ALSO RESPONDED TO TWO HIJACKINGS.  IN SEPTEMBER, 
AUTHORITIES ARRESTED AN IRAQI MAN WHO HIJACKED A QATAR 
AIR FLIGHT FROM QATAR TO JORDAN AND FORCED IT TO LAND 
IN THE NORTHERN SAUDI TOWN OF HA\'IL.  THE SAG RETURNED 
THE HIJACKER AND PASSENGERS TO QATAR.  IN OCTOBER, TWO 
SAUDI MEN FORCED A SAUDI ARABIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT FROM 
JEDDAH TO LONDON TO LAND IN IRAQ.  IRAQI AUTHORITIES 
DETAINED THE HIJACKERS AND RETURNED THE PASSENGERS AND 
AIRCRAFT TO JEDDAH.  IRAQ DENIED AN EXTRADITION 
REQUEST BY THE SAG.  NO ONE WAS HARMED IN EITHER 
HIJACKING.  SAUDI AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO INVESTIGATING 
TWO CAR BOMBINGS IN RIYADH IN NOVEMBER IN WHICH ONE 
BRITISH CITIZEN WAS KILLED AND SEVERAL WERE INJURED. 
AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT DETERMINED WHETHER THE MOTIVE OF 
THE BOMBINGS WAS CRIMINAL OR POLITICAL. 
 
B)   DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION 
DURING THE YEAR? PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN 
TO HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO U.S. REQUESTS FOR 
EXTRADITION OR ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG REQUESTED THAT IRAQ EXTRADITE TWO 
SAUDI MEN WHO HIJACKED A SAUDI ARABIAN AIRLINES PLANE 
FROM JEDDAH TO BAGHDAD.  IRAQ DENIED THE REQUEST. 
SAUDI AUTHORITIES RETURNED AN IRAQI MAN TO QATAR WHO 
HIJACKED A JORDAN-BOUND PLANE FROM QATAR TO HA\'IL, 
SAUDI ARABIA.  THE SAUDIS HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED ON 
THE TALEBAN TO EXPEL USAMA BIN LADEN FROM AFGHAN 
TERRITORY SO THAT HE MAY BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE IN 
ANOTHER COUNTRY. 
 
C)   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS. 
 
RESPONSE: NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO 
THE SAG\'S PROSECUTION OF PEOPLE ALLEGED TO HAVE 
COMMITTED TERRORIST ACTS WITHIN SAUDI ARABIA. 
HOWEVER, THE SAG HAS FEW EXTRADITION TREATIES OUTSIDE 
OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 
ISLAMIC COUNCIL (OIC) AND THE ARAB LEAGUE. THE 
LEAGUE\'S ANTI-TERRORIST AGREEMENT, WHICH SAUDI ARABIA 
HAS RATIFIED, CONTAINS EXTRADITION ARTICLES. 
 
D)   DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN 
PROSECUTION. THESE WOULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED 
TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR 
OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A TERRORIST INCIDENT 
(IN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST 
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO 
ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
RESPONSE: IN MAY THE SAG SIGNED A TREATY WITH MEMBER 
STATES OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ISLAMIC COUNCIL 
(OIC) TO COOPERATE IN COMBATING TERRORISM.  AT A 
SIGNING CEREMONY, A SAG REPRESENTATIVE DECLARED THAT 
IT IS THE POLICY OF SAUDI ARABIA TO FIGHT ALL FORMS OF 
TERRORISM. THE KING, CROWN PRINCE, MINISTER OF 
DEFENSE, MINISTER OF INTERIOR, MINISTER OF 
INFORMATION, SENIOR ULAMA, AND OFFICIAL NEWS MEDIA 
PUBLICLY AND CONSISTENTLY CONDEMN TERRORISM IN 
UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS, INCLUDING BY REFUTING IDEOLOGICAL 
AND RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TERRORISM. 
 
E)   DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS 
UNDERTAKEN IN 2000 BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING 
STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
RESPONSE: INTERNALLY, THE SAG CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE 
THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBING.  IT HAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN 
NUMEROUS MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN PROTECTION OF U.S. 
MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL. 
 
F)   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT 
FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST 
GROUPS, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS AND THEIR ACTIVITIES; 
DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION; 
MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC 
POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT 
TERRORISM; PROVISION OF SANCTUARY AND/OR THE PRESENCE 
OF OFFICES OF TERRORIST GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING 
OR TRAINING SITES; PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS 
TAKEN ON TERRORISM IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG DOES NOT POLITICALLY OR FINANCIALLY 
SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR 
ACTIVITIES.  ITS REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NON- 
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY 
AGENCIES OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT 
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES. 
HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THESE REGULATIONS ARE 
CONSISTENTLY ENFORCED.  THERE CONTINUE TO BE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION REPRESENTATIVES SOLICIT AND COLLECT FUNDS 
FROM PRIVATE CITIZENS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
G)   HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE SEVEN GOVERNMENTS 
DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY AS STATE SPONSORS OF 
TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, 
SYRIA, AND SUDAN.) 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUPPORTING 
ANY OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S TERRORISM LIST 
REGARDING A TERRORIST ISSUE. 
 
H)   DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1999, 
POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC. 
WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? 
 
RESPONSE:  THE ATTITUDE OF THE SAG TOWARD TERRORISM 
DID NOT CHANGE DURING 1999. 
 
I)   DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND 
INITIATIVES WITH THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, REQUESTS TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT FOR 
SPECIFIC COOPERATION AND EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES 
IN THE HOST COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE INTERNATIONAL 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY OR IN 
SUPPORT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES. DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF 
THE HOST COUNTRY\'S COOPERATION WITH THOSE EFFORTS AND 
INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT HAS SATISFIED THE SPECIFIC REQUESTS. 
 
RESPONSE: FOLLOWING A 1995 BOMBING THAT KILLED U.S. 
MILITARY PERSONNEL ADVISING THE SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL 
GUARD (OPM/SANG), A USG INTERAGENCY COUNTERTERRORISM 
TEAM VISITED SAUDI ARABIA TO BEGIN UNPRECEDENTED, 
COORDINATED, INTERAGENCY CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE USG 
AND SAG ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY ISSUES.  THIS 
COOPERATION, WHICH ENGENDERED HIGH-LEVEL SAG INTEREST 
AND THE PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE SAG MINISTRIES, HAS 
CONTINUED THROUGHOUT 2000.  THE USG AND SAG CONTINUE 
TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND 
SECURITY ISSUES AFFECTING AMERICAN AND SAUDI INTERESTS 
IN THE REGION.  CONSULTATIONS AND TRAINING FOR SAUDI 
COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED 
STATES ALSO OCCURRED.  U.S. AND SAUDI OFFICIALS HAVE 
MET IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO 
ELIMINATE TRANS-NATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO 
TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY.  COOPERATION 
BETWEEN THE USG AND SAG INCREASED FURTHER AFTER THE 
1998 EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS.  THE FBI COORDINATES ITS 
INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS WITH THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR 
AND MAINTAINS A PERMANENTLY STAFFED LEGAL ATTACHE 
OFFICE IN THE U.S. EMBASSY. 
 
J)   IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL INFORMATION, IF THE 
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN 
THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES 
CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: 
 
     (I) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 
2000 COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED 
STATES GOVERNMENT IN APPREHENDING, CONVICTING, AND 
PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE ACT; AND 
 
     (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 
2000 COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING IN PREVENTING 
FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES 
CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
RESPONSE: (I)  THE SAG HAS SOUGHT TO APPREHEND, 
CONVICT, AND PUNISH THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
BOTH THE OPM/SANG AND KHOBAR TOWERS BOMBINGS AGAINST 
UNITED STATES CITIZENS, ALTHOUGH EARLY COOPERATION WAS 
NOT AT THE LEVEL EXPECTED BY USG OFFICIALS.  SAUDI 
OFFICIALS AND THE FBI CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY ON MANY 
INVESTIGATION ISSUES RELATED TO BOTH BOMBINGS AND 
CONSULT CLOSELY WITH EACH OTHER ON THE STATUS OF THE 
KHOBAR BOMBING INVESTIGATION. 
 
  (II) THE SAG CONTINUES TO DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE HUMAN 
AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECT USG PERSONNEL AND 
INTERESTS FOLLOWING THE OPM/SANG, KHOBAR TOWERS, EAST 
AFRICA BOMBINGS, AND THREATS TO THE U.S. EMBASSY, 
CONSULATES AND OTHER U.S. INTERESTS IN 2000.  IT MADE 
AVAILABLE TO COALITION FORCES THE PRINCE SULTAN 
AIRBASE AT AL KHARJ, WHERE MOST U.S. SERVICEMEN IN 
SAUDI ARABIA ARE NOW LOCATED, AND A RESIDENTIAL 
COMPOUND, KNOWN AS ESKAN VILLAGE, SOUTH OF RIYADH FOR 
MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DOD PERSONNEL.  THE SAG SPENT 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FACILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE SECURITY.  THE SAG ALSO WORKED 
WITH AMERICAN SECURITY PERSONNEL IN AN ONGOING EFFORT 
TO ENHANCE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AT ALL OTHER USG 
FACILITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA, INCLUDING THE U.S. EMBASSY 
IN RIYADH AND THE CONSULATES IN JEDDAH AND DHAHRAN. 
USG AND SAG OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY TO 
REVIEW THE SAFETY OF AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
K)   IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT 
COOPERATION DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE 
PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE DESCRIBE 
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 2000 
COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF 
TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG HAS PROVIDED TO THE USG INFORMATION 
ON THREATS DIRECTED AT U.S. INTERESTS IN SAUDI ARABIA 
AND CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH USG AGENCIES TO 
PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICANS IN THE 
KINGDOM.  REPORTED THREATS HAVE REGULARLY LED TO THE 
RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF EXTRA SECURITY PERSONNEL AND THE 
PLACEMENT OF PERMANENT PHYSICAL BARRIERS, CHECKPOINTS, 
AND OTHER VISIBLE DETERRENTS.

TAGS: PGOV, ECON, SOCI, SA 
SUBJECT: THE AL SAUD AND CHALLENGES TO STABILITY 
 
CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES CHARLES H. BRAYSHAW. 
REASON:  1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) AT PRESENT, SAUDI ARABIA ENJOYS AT LEAST 
SUPERFICIAL STABILITY.  THERE IS NO DEBILITATING 
DISUNITY AMONG SENIOR AL SAUD PRINCES, REGIME CRITICS 
HAVE BEEN EXILED OR MARGINALIZED ABROAD AND CO-OPTED 
OR MUZZLED AT HOME, AND A LARGELY APOLITICAL CITIZENRY 
SHOWS NO INCLINATION TO DEMAND GREATER PARTICIPATION 
IN PUBLIC LIFE.  FACTORS SUCH AS THE HISTORICAL 
CONTINUITY OF AL SAUD RULE, A LONG TRADITION OF 
OBEDIENCE TO THE RULER AND A CORRESPONDING ABHORRENCE 
OF DISORDER, AND A DEARTH OF POLITICAL ALTERNATIVES 
BODE WELL FOR CONTINUED STABILITY AND REGIME SURVIVAL. 
 
2. (C) IN THE INTERMEDIATE/LONGER-TERM, HOWEVER, THE 
MAINTENANCE OF STABILITY WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON HOW 
THE AL SAUD DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF FESTERING ECONOMIC, 
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS, AMONG THEM: A LOW- 
GROWTH ECONOMY OVERLY DEPENDANT ON OIL; THE 
EXPECTATIONS AND ASPIRATIONS OF AN EXPLODING YOUTH 
POPULATION; AN EMERGING STRUGGLE BETWEEN A MINORITY OF 
ISLAMIC CONSERVATIVES AND A MORE MODERATE MAJORITY 
OVER THE KINGDOM\'S DIRECTION; AND LATENT REGIONAL AND 
TRIBAL TENSIONS.  WHILE TOP LEVEL SAG LEADERS APPEAR 
TO BE AWARE OF THESE CHALLENGES AND ARE MOVING IN THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION TO CONFRONT THEM, IT REMAINS TO BE 
SEEN WHETHER THEIR MEASURES WILL SUFFICE IN PACE AND 
SCOPE.  OTHER SENIOR LEADERS ARE ENGAGED IN POLICIES 
OR BEHAVIOR THAT COULD UNDERMINE STABILITY. 
 
3. (C) AT ALL TIMES, THE \"WILD CARD\" IN ANY ANALYSIS 
OF SAUDI STABILITY IS ROYAL FAMILY DYNAMICS.  WHILE 
THE CONTINUED REIGN OF 80 YEAR-OLD KING FAHD CASTS AN 
OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF STABILITY AND CONTINUITY, IT IS 
ACTUALLY A SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIAL 
INSTABILITY.  IN THE NEAR/INTERMEDIATE-TERM, THE 
KINGDOM WILL LIKELY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONE ROYAL 
SUCCESSION, THE RESULTS OF WHICH COULD THREATEN THE 
INDISPENSABLE ELEMENT OF AL SAUD VIABILITY: ROYAL 
FAMILY UNITY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
ROYAL DYNAMICS 
-------------- 
 
4. (C) LARGELY INCAPACITATED AND A SHADOW OF HIS 
FORMER SELF, KING FAHD - AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, FAHD\'S 
SONS AND COURT SYCOPHANTS - HAVE NO APPARENT INTEREST 
IN HIS ABDICATION.  FAHD\'S STUBBORN GRASP OF THE 
RULING SCEPTER (AND, INDEED, OF LIFE ITSELF) IS 
IMPEDING THE TRANSITION PROCESS AND MAY HAVE NEGATIVE 
FUTURE CONSEQUENCES FOR AL SAUD RULE.  (A SAUDI JOKE 
HAS IT THAT FAHD IS CALLED \"THE CONQUEROR OF DEATH\" 
BECAUSE THE ANGEL OF DEATH FEARS TO APPROACH HIM.) 
 
5.  (C) IN A NARROW SENSE, FAHD\'S CONTINUED PRESENCE 
ON THE THRONE DEPRIVES CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH OF THE 
FULL AUTHORITY OF A SAUDI MONARCH, THUS INHIBITING HIS 
ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS.  AMONG SENIOR SONS OF 
THE LATE KING ABD AL-AZIZ, ABDULLAH IS PROBABLY THE 
BEST QUALIFIED TO LEAD THE KINGDOM THROUGH CHANGING 
TIMES.  HE POSSESSES GREATER POPULAR CREDIBILITY AND A 
MORE PROGRESSIVE, PRAGMATIC OUTLOOK THAN POWERFUL 
HALF-BROTHERS DEFENSE MINISTER SULTAN OR INTERIOR 
MINISTER NAIF.  EVEN IF HE WERE KING, HOWEVER, 
ABDULLAH WOULD BE OBLIGED TO SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY 
DEVELOP CONSENSUS FOR HIS MODEST REFORM INITIATIVES: 
ABDULLAH\'S CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES ONLY INCREASE HIS 
BURDEN OF CONSENSUS-BUILDING. 
 
6. (C) IN A BROADER SENSE, THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF 
THE 80 YEAR-OLD KING FAHD ADDS AN ELEMENT OF 
UNCERTAINTY INTO THE SUCCESSION PROCESS AND MAY HINDER 
A SMOOTH TRANSITION AFTER HIS EVENTUAL PASSING.  AFTER 
ALL, 78 YEAR-OLD ABDULLAH AND 77 YEAR-OLD SULTAN (THE 
APPARENT THIRD IN LINE) ARE ONLY SLIGHTLY YOUNGER THAN 
FAHD AND BOTH SUFFER FROM AILMENTS COMMON TO 
SEPTUAGENARIANS LONG-ACCUSTOMED TO A SEDENTARY, 
LUXURIOUS LIFESTYLE (ABDULLAH ALSO WORKS LONG HOURS 
AND LABORS UNDER CONSIDERABLE STRESS).  IT IS POSSIBLE 
THAT FAHD COULD REMAIN IN PLACE RIGHT THROUGH THEIR 
REMAINING PRIME WORKING YEARS AND POSSIBLY EVEN 
OUTLIVE ONE OR BOTH.  SHOULD FAHD SURVIVE ABDULLAH, HE 
WOULD HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT UNDER THE 1992 BASIC 
LAW TO APPOINT A NEW CROWN PRINCE, AND FAHD\'S SONS 
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A MAJOR ROLE IN THE DECISION- 
MAKING PROCESS.  WHILE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT 
FAHD WOULD LIKELY TAP ONE OF HIS FULL \"SUDAYRI SEVEN\" 
BROTHERS (SULTAN, DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER ABD AL- 
RAHMAN, NAIF AND RIYADH GOVERNOR SALMAN, IN ORDER OF 
SENIORITY), IT IS AT LEAST REMOTELY POSSIBLE THAT HE 
COULD APPOINT ONE OF HIS SONS, PERHAPS HIS YOUNGEST 
SON, 28 YEAR-OLD ABD AL-AZIZ BIN FAHD, CURRENT 
MINISTER OF STATE, AS CROWN PRINCE. 
 
7. (C) TO A LARGE EXTENT, THE AL SAUD ARE MASTERS OF 
THEIR OWN RULING DESTINY AND ARE PROBABLY MOST 
VULNERABLE TO SELF-INFLICTED THREATS: THE 
DISINTEGRATION OF UNITY AMONG SENIOR ROYAL FAMILY 
MEMBERS; CONDUCT BY THE KING OR SENIOR PRINCES WHICH 
IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS UN-ISLAMIC; AND PERCEIVED 
EGREGIOUS ROYAL CORRUPTION AND/OR NEGLECT OF THE 
PUBLIC WEAL, PARTICULARLY IF ECONOMIC TIMES ARE 
DIFFICULT.  THESE VULNERABILITIES ARE LOW UNDER 
CURRENT CONDITIONS AND IN THE CASE OF AN ABDULLAH 
KINGSHIP.  CREDIBLE RUMORS OF CORRUPT PRACTICES, 
HOWEVER, HAVE LONG SWIRLED ABOUT DEFENSE MINISTER 
SULTAN AND HIS ELDEST SON KHALID, THUS INCREASING THE 
PROSPECTS FOR INSTABILITY DURING A POSSIBLE SULTAN 
REIGN.  ALL THREE VULNERABILITIES COULD BE EXPOSED IF 
FAHD WERE TO TRY TO PLACE ONE OF HIS OWN SONS ON THE 
THRONE, NONE OF WHOM POSSESS RESPECT EITHER WITHIN THE 
ROYAL FAMILY OR AMONG THE PUBLIC.  THIS IS 
PARTICULARLY TRUE OF ABD AL-AZIZ, WHO IS WIDELY 
CONSIDERED TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ROYAL BARREL IN 
TERMS OF PERSONAL PROBITY AND DECORUM. 
 
 
THE ISLAMIC POLITY AND LACK OF INSTITUTIONS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) AS ONE OF THE TWO BEDROCK COMPONENTS OF THE 
SAUDI RULING CONTRACT, THE AL SAUD ACQUIRED LEGITIMACY 
IN EXCHANGE FOR ENFORCEMENT OF SHARI\'A LEGAL/SOCIAL 
STRICTURES, CUSTODIANSHIP OF ISLAM\'S HOLIEST SHRINES, 
AND ALLOWING THE ISLAMIC ESTABLISHMENT TO DEFINE 
SOCIAL MORES AND CONTROL SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS.  REGIME ACCOMMODATION OF THE VIEWS OF 
RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES HAS PROVEN TO BE A RELATIVELY 
LOW-COST PROPOSITION, AND SOME BELIEVE THAT THE SAG 
CYNICALLY ALLOWS THE ISLAMIC ESTABLISHMENT TO DIVERT 
PUBLIC ATTENTION TO RELATIVELY TRIFLING MATTERS (E.G. 
THE ALLEGED ANTI-ISLAMIC NATURE OF POKEMON PRODUCTS, 
THE APPROPRIATE SPECIFICATIONS FOR WOMEN\'S ABAYAS, 
ETC.) LEST IT FOCUS ON VITALLY IMPORTANT TOPICS SUCH 
AS THE REGIME\'S ABILITY TO DELIVER JOBS OR EVEN 
ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF POTABLE WATER IN THE FUTURE. 
HOWEVER, THIS APPARENT BENEFIT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE 
RANKS OF GRADUATING YOUTH WITH NOTHING BUT RELIGIOUS 
TRAINING WHO ARE ILL-PREPARED TO CONTRIBUTE TO A 
MODERNIZING ECONOMY. 
 
9.  (C) STILL, THE AL SAUD, MOST OF WHOM PURSUE A MORE 
LIBERAL, EVEN DISSOLUTE, LIFESTYLE IN PRIVATE, CAN ILL 
AFFORD TO BE PERCEIVED AS LESS DEVOUT OR ZEALOUS THAN 
THEIR HAND-PICKED ISLAMIC LEADERS AND SCHOLARS: THUS, 
WE SEE LITTLE NEAR OR INTERMEDIATE TERM SAG MOVEMENT 
ON SOCIAL ISSUES WHICH CARRY SIGNIFICANT EMOTIONAL 
BAGGAGE SUCH AS WOMEN\'S RIGHTS.  THE AL SAUD\'S 
INDULGENCE OF THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT ALSO 
CONTRIBUTES TO THE SLOW PACE OF ECONOMIC REFORM, SINCE 
THE \'ULAMA OPPOSE OPENING THE SAUDI ECONOMY, FEARING 
THAT IT WILL LEAD TO GREATER FOREIGN, PARTICULARLY 
WESTERN, INFLUENCE. 
 
10. (C) THE SEEDS OF FRICTION WITHIN SAUDI SOCIETY ARE 
GROUNDED IN CONFLICTING VIEWS ABOUT THE KINGDOM\'S 
MORAL DIRECTION IN GENERAL, AND THE PERVASIVE SPREAD 
OF WESTERN (PRIMARILY AMERICAN) CULTURE AND WHAT SOME 
SAUDIS PERCEIVE AS THE CONCOMITANT EROSION OF ISLAMIC 
AND TRADITIONAL ARABIAN VALUES IN PARTICULAR.  SOME 
SAUDI CONTACTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING 
EFFORT BY A VOCAL, INFLUENTIAL, AND HIGHLY-MOTIVATED 
RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE MINORITY TO PLACE LIKE-MINDED 
PEOPLE IN AS MANY POSITIONS OF DAY-TO-DAY 
ADMINISTRATIVE, EDUCATIONAL, AND SOCIAL AUTHORITY AS 
POSSIBLE BEFORE A RELATIVELY MODERATE (BUT SILENT) 
MAJORITY GAINS ASCENDANCY.  IF THIS IS INDEED THE 
CASE, A SITUATION SOMEWHAT AKIN TO THE PRESENT 
ENVIRONMENT IN IRAN COULD DEVELOP, WHERE A RELATIVELY 
MODERATE AND LARGELY YOUTHFUL MAJORITY STRUGGLES WITH 
AN ENTRENCHED CONSERVATIVE MINORITY FOR CONTROL OF THE 
COUNTRY\'S DIRECTION. 
 
11. (C) ALTHOUGH THE KINGDOM\'S INCREASING URBANIZATION 
(ACCORDING TO WORLD BANK STATISTICS, 85 PERCENT OF 
SAUDIS LIVE IN TOWNS OR CITIES AND THE PERCENTAGE IS 
GROWING) HAS SOMEWHAT DIMINISHED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
TRIBAL IDENTITY, IT REMAINS A POWERFUL FACTOR IN SAUDI 
SOCIETY, AND INTER-TRIBAL FRICTION COULD BECOME A 
SOURCE OF FUTURE INSTABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF 
ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.  A POTENTIALLY GREATER SOURCE OF 
INSTABILITY IS REGIONAL IDENTITY AND A WIDESPREAD 
PERCEPTION THAT THE LEAST PRODUCTIVE AND ECONOMICALLY- 
VIABLE AREA OF THE KINGDOM, THE ARID AND CENTRAL 
NEJD/QASSIM REGION (HOME OF THE AL SAUD, SUCKS UP THE 
OIL WEALTH OF THE EASTERN REGION AND THE TRADING 
WEALTH OF THE WESTERN HIJAZ REGION.  IN ADDITION, THE 
SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF NAJRAN, JIZAN, AND ASIR, SEIZED 
FROM YEMEN IN THE EARLY 1930\'S, HAVE NEVER BEEN 
EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED INTO THE SAUDI MAINSTREAM, 
EITHER ECONOMICALLY OR CULTURALLY.  AGAIN, THE TREND 
OF STEADILY DECLINING LIVING STANDARDS HAS THE 
POTENTIAL TO FUEL LATENT REGIONAL RESENTMENTS, 
PARTICULARLY IF SAG LEADERS CONTINUE TO FUNNEL 
INCREASINGLY SCARCE RESOURCES DISPROPORTIONATELY TO 
THE NEJD. 
 
12. (C) THE AL SAUD HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ESTABLISH 
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE SHURA COUNCIL WHICH HOLD THE 
POTENTIAL TO ALLOW GREATER PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN 
GOVERNANCE.  AT PRESENT, HOWEVER, SUCH INSTITUTIONS 
HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT VOICE IN SAUDI PUBLIC LIFE.  IN 
ADDITION, THERE IS NO \"CIVIL SOCIETY\" AS THE CONCEPT 
IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD.  COBBLED TOGETHER FROM 
DISPARATE TRIBES AND INFLUENTIAL CLANS 80 YEARS AGO, 
SAUDI SOCIETY IS MADE UP OF A PATCHWORK OF REGIONAL 
AND TRIBAL INTERESTS HELD TOGETHER BY THE POWER OF THE 
AL SAUD, AND THE MODERNIZING ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE LAST 
FIFTY YEARS, AND LITTLE ELSE.  PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES, 
LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, AND INTEREST GROUPS ARE GENERALLY 
EITHER CREATED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR BANNED COMPLETELY. 
WHILE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY DETECT A GROUNDSWELL OF 
INTEREST IN POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AMONG THE MOSTLY 
APOLITICAL SAUDI PUBLIC, FACTORS SUCH AS A NEW-FOUND 
AVAILABILITY OF OUTSIDE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND 
COMMUNICATION COULD CHANGE THIS, PARTICULARLY IF 
COMBINED WITH AN ECONOMIC DECLINE AND ATTENDANT 
FRUSTRATIONS. 
 
 
THE DEMOGRAPHIC TIME BOMB 
------------------------- 
 
13.  (C)  THE AL SAUD\'S PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF A 
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE KINGDOM\'S WEALTH IN RETURN 
FOR THE CITIZENRY\'S OBEDIENCE IS THE OTHER COMPONENT 
OF THE SAUDI RULING CONTRACT.  THIS DISTRIBUTION IS 
FACILITATED BY THE CONCENTRATION OF THE ECONOMY IN THE 
PETROLEUM SECTOR.  HOWEVER, AS CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH 
FAMOUSLY WARNED TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO, THE EASY 
YEARS HAVE PASSED. 
 
14.  (U) THE MOTIVATION FOR THE SAG\'S ECONOMIC REFORM 
EFFORT IS CLEAR.  WITH A POPULATION GROWTH RATE OF 
CLOSE TO 4% DURING MUCH OF THE LAST 20 YEARS AND OVER 
HALF THE SAUDI POPULATION UNDER THE AGE OF 18, SAUDI 
ARABIA IS FACING A DEMOGRAPHIC TIME BOMB.  (THE SAG 
ESTIMATES THAT THE RATE OF POPULATION GROWTH HAS 
RECENTLY DROPPED TO AROUND 3%.)  UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES 
FOR WORKING AGE SAUDI MALES RANGE FROM THE OFFICIAL 
RATE OF 14% TO A SAUDI NEWSPAPER COMMENTATOR\'S 
ESTIMATE OF 46%.  IN ANY CASE, NEITHER WOMEN NOR 
UNDEREMPLOYMENT ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  BECAUSE OF 
THE VOLATILITY OF OIL PRICES, THE OIL AND 
PETROCHEMICAL SECTORS EXPERIENCE WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN 
GROWTH AND ARE HEAVILY CAPITAL INTENSIVE.  THUS, THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS PINNED ITS HOPES ON THE NON-OIL, 
PRIVATE SECTOR TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR THE 100,000 SAUDI 
MALE JOB SEEKERS (MANY WITHOUT POST SECONDARY 
EDUCATION) ENTERING THE LABOR MARKET EVERY YEAR. 
(CURRENTLY, ONLY ABOUT 50,000 NEW EMPLOYEES PER YEAR 
ARE HIRED, ALMOST ALL BY THE SAG.)  THE CROWN PRINCE 
RECOGNIZES THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO 
ACT AS EMPLOYER OF LAST RESORT OR PROVIDE FREE MEDICAL 
CARE AND EDUCATION TO ALL SAUDIS. 
 
15.  (U) THE GOVERNMENT\'S PURPOSE OVER THE PAST THREE 
YEARS IN SEEKING TO MODERNIZE THE ECONOMY BY REVISING 
MOST OF THE BASIC ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL LAWS, 
ACCELERATING EFFORTS TO JOIN THE WORLD TRADE 
ORGANIZATION, AND OFFERING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OIL 
COMPANIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN THE GAS SECTOR 
IS ALSO CLEAR -- TO SPUR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND 
DEVELOPMENT.  THE EXPECTATION IS THAT AN OPEN, LIBERAL 
ECONOMY WILL ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND, EVEN MORE 
IMPORTANT, BRING SAUDI OVERSEAS CAPITAL (ESTIMATED AT 
BETWEEN $600-800 BILLION) HOME.  (NOTE: AS A POINT OF 
REFERENCE, 2000 SAUDI GDP WAS USD 173 BILLION.)  THE 
SAUDIS HOPE THIS WILL GENERATE PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH 
AND CREATE JOBS. 
 
 
SO LITTLE, SO LATE 
------------------ 
 
16.  (C) THE PACE OF REFORM IN SAUDI ARABIA IS SLOW 
AND THE RESULTS IN TERMS OF NEW INVESTMENT AND JOB 
CREATION EVEN SLOWER TO MATERIALIZE.  THE CROWN 
PRINCE\'S GAS INITIATIVE, LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 1998, 
IS MOVING FORWARD PRETTY MUCH ON SCHEDULE, BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL OIL COMPANIES ARE NOT 
EXPECTED TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THE COMMERCIAL TERMS OF 
THE PROJECTS UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT 
YEAR.  WITH ARAMCO\'S PROVEN GAS RESERVES OFF LIMITS, 
THE OIL COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO FIND GAS TO RUN THE 
DESALINATION AND POWER PLANTS THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO 
BUILD.  THE THREE CONSORTIA OF INTERNATIONAL OIL 
COMPANIES THAT WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GAS 
INITIATIVE ARE EXPECTED TO INVEST $25 BILLION DOLLARS 
OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD.  MUCH OF THAT INVESTMENT MAY 
BE DELAYED UNTIL THE INVESTORS FIND AND DEVELOP THAT 
GAS.  SAUDI ARABIA IS UNLIKELY TO SEE ANY OF THAT 
MONEY UNTIL SOMETIME NEXT YEAR. 
 
17.  (C) THE PROCESS OF OVERHAULING SAUDI ARABIA\'S 
LAWS IS A DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. 
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE -- A NEW FOREIGN DIRECT 
INVESTMENT LAW WAS ADOPTED, THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR WAS 
RESTRUCTURED, A PRIVATIZATION STRATEGY WAS ADOPTED, 
TOURIST VISAS ARE BEING GRANTED, FOREIGN INVESTORS CAN 
INVEST IN THE SAUDI STOCK MARKET THROUGH MUTUAL FUNDS 
MANAGED BY LOCAL BANKS, TARIFFS ON MOST IMPORTS WERE 
CUT TO 5%, AND NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR WERE ADOPTED.  MUCH MORE 
REMAINS TO BE DONE -- NEW LAWS COVERING CAPITAL 
MARKETS, TAXES, COMPANY LAW, AGENCY LAW, LABOR 
RELATIONS, AND IPR ARE ALL UNDER PREPARATION.  WE ARE 
FINDING, HOWEVER, THAT EVEN WHEN A NEW POLICY OR LAW 
IS ADOPTED, THE IMPLEMENTATION MAY NOT LIVE UP TO 
EXPECTATIONS.  THE NEW FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT LAW 
HAS NOT RENDERED THE INVESTMENT PROCESS APPRECIABLY 
MORE TRANSPARENT OR INVESTOR FRIENDLY.  HOPES WERE 
HIGH FOR PRIVATIZATION AS A PATH TO ECONOMIC REFORM A 
YEAR AGO, BUT ANY POSSIBILITIES OF PRIVATIZATION 
(E.G., THE SAUDI TELECOM COMPANY OR SAUDI ARABIA 
AIRLINES) ARE YEARS AWAY. 
 
18.  (C) THE MOMENTUM FOR WTO ACCESSION APPEARS TO BE 
FLAGGING.  ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE CROWN PRINCE\'S 
COMMITMENT TO GAINING WTO MEMBERSHIP REMAINS FIRM, THE 
DIFFICULTY OF MOVING LEGISLATION AND THE NECESSARY 
IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS THROUGH THE SYSTEM HAS SLOWED 
THINGS TO A CRAWL.  THE CROWN PRINCE\'S APPOINTMENT OF 
PRINCE NAIF TO OVERSEE ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO HAVE GALVANIZED THE BUREAUCRACY.  THE ONLY 
MAJOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL OF 
MINISTERS SINCE THE LAST WTO ACCESSION WORKING PARTY 
MEETING IN OCTOBER 2000 WAS THE NEW TELECOM 
REGULATIONS APPROVED IN MAY.  KEY LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
DESIGNED TO BRING THE SAUDI TRADE AND INVESTMENT 
REGIME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH WTO STANDARDS ARE MONTHS 
AWAY FROM COMPLETION. 
 
 
IS IT ENOUGH? 
------------- 
 
19.  (C) SAUDI ARABIA SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR ITS GOOD 
INTENTIONS.  BUT SHOULD SAUDI ARABIA BECOME A WTO 
MEMBER AND IMPLEMENT THE BULK OF THE REFORM PROGRAM AS 
CURRENTLY ENVISAGED, IT WOULD STILL FACE SERIOUS 
ECONOMIC CHALLENGES.  IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE PACE 
AND SCOPE OF REFORMS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT 
SIGNIFICANT SAUDI OR FOREIGN INVESTMENT INTO THE NON- 
OIL PRIVATE SECTOR AND GENERATE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH 
NEEDED TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT.  THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES THESE REFORMS AND WTO 
MEMBERSHIP DO NOT AND WILL NOT ADDRESS.  THESE INCLUDE 
THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OIL REVENUES THAT NEVER MAKE 
IT TO THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE FOR INCLUSION IN THE 
GOVERNMENT BUDGET; THE LACK OF A MODERN, LEGAL 
FRAMEWORK FOR SETTLING COMMERCIAL DISPUTES; THE LACK 
OF A SAUDI INCOME TAX (PERSONAL OR CORPORATE) TO 
PROVIDE THE GOVERNMENT WITH A MORE STABLE REVENUE 
BASE; THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY OF REQUIRING BUSINESSES 
TO HIRE SAUDIS WHO, IN MANY CASES, LACK SKILLS AND 
MOTIVATION; FEAR OF ARBITRARY, CONFISCATORY ACTIONS BY 
THE ROYAL FAMILY; AND CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT 
PROCUREMENT.  ALL THESE FACTORS DRIVE WEALTHY SAUDIS 
TO INVEST OVERSEAS LIMITING THE NUMBER OF FOREIGN 
INVESTORS WHO ARE WILLING TO PUT MONEY INTO SAUDI 
ARABIA. 
 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
 
20. (C) THE AL SAUD\'S ABILITY TO FULFILL THE 
EXPECTATIONS OF THE KINGDOM\'S GROWING YOUTH POPULATION 
WILL BE A KEY FACTOR IN OVERALL STABILITY.  THE PUSH 
TO EMPLOY SAUDIS IN PLACE OF THE SEVEN MILLION FOREIGN 
WORKERS MAY HELP, IN SPITE OF THE LACK OF BASIC 
QUALIFICATIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT WHICH PERVADES THE 
YOUNGER GENERATION.  WITH FALTERING AND UNEVEN PUBLIC 
SUPPORT FOR WTO ACCESSION AND ECONOMIC REFORMS AND THE 
STILLBORN PROGRAM TO PROVIDE VOCATIONAL TRAINING, THE 
AL SAUD FAMILY FACES MAJOR CHALLENGES IN DELIVERING ON 
THE ECONOMIC PART OF THE RULING BARGAIN, WHICH IN TURN 
COULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON STABILITY. 
 
21. (C) STILL, ALL BUT A DWINDLING NUMBER OF ELDERLY 
SAUDIS HAVE KNOWN NOTHING BUT AL SAUD RULE, AND IT IS 
PROBABLY DIFFICULT FOR MOST SAUDIS TO IMAGINE LIFE 
WITHOUT AN AL SAUD FAMILY MEMBER ON THE THRONE. 
BARRING FALLOUT OVER SUCCESSION SURPRISES OR A 
CATASTROPHIC REGIONAL POLITICAL UPHEAVAL, THE ROYAL 
FAMILY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF 
THE KINGDOM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  HOWEVER, 
FACED WITH A SITUATION WHERE THEY MUST GRANT MORE 
FREEDOM TO FOSTER PROGRESS, BOTH ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIETAL, THE AL SAUD RUN THE RISK THAT THIS SAME 
FREEDOM WILL UNDERMINE THEIR MUCH-CHERISHED DISCIPLINE 
AND CONFORMITY.  THE AL SAUD\'S ABILITY TO ADAPT TO 
CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST AS THE 
FRUITS OF RAPID POPULATION GROWTH, POOR ECONOMIC 
PERFORMANCE, AND CODDLING OF THE ISLAMIC ESTABLISHMENT 
BECOME EVER APPARENT. 
 
22. (U) THIS CABLE FULFILLS A REQUIREMENT OF POST\'S 
REPORTING PLAN.

OFFICIAL SAG REACTION 
--------------------- 
 
1.  ON THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 11, THE SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT ISSUED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT (UNOFFICIAL 
TRANSLATION): 
 
THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA EXPRESSES ITS CONDEMNATION 
OF THE REGRETTABLE AND INHUMAN EXPLOSIONS AND ATTACKS 
WHICH OCCURRED AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK 
AND THE PENTAGON IN WASHINGTON IN THE U.S.A.  THE 
KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA STRONGLY CONDEMNS ACTS SUCH AS 
THESE WHICH ARE IN CONFLICT WITH ALL RELIGIOUS VALUES 
AND SOCIAL AND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.  THE KINGDOM 
OFFERS ITS SINCERE CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF THE 
VICTIMS, TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, AND TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE.  THE KINGDOM REITERATES ITS 
CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM AND WILL CONTINUE TO ACT 
ALONG WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COMBAT 
TERRORISM IN ALL OF ITS FORMS. 
 
2.  SAUDI MEDIA COVERAGE WILL BE REPORTED SEPTEL, BUT 
THE STORY DOMINATES WITH A SOMBER EDITORIAL TONE 
EXPRESSING SHOCK, GLOOM, SADNESS AND DEPRESSION. 
 
PUBLIC REACTION 
--------------- 
 
3.  MOVING ABOUT RIYADH ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER 11, 
POLOFF OBSERVED A BEEFED-UP SAG SECURITY PRESENCE, 
PARTICULARLY AROUND THE DIPLOMATIC QUARTER.  LOCAL 
STORES WERE BUSY, THOUGH FEW WESTERN EXPATS WERE 
SHOPPING.  POLOFF HAD SEVERAL CHANCE ENCOUNTERS WITH 
SAUDIS AND NON-WESTERN EXPATS, ALL OF WHOM EXPRESSED 
CONDOLENCES AND OFFERED SYMPATHY.  AN ENCOUNTER 
OUTSIDE OF A LARGE SHOPPING MALL WAS REPRESENTATIVE. 
A GROUP OF FOUR THIRTY-ISH SAUDI MALES EXPRESSED 
CONDOLENCES, THEN ONE COMMENTED THAT HE WAS CONCERNED 
ABOUT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, ESPECIALLY REGARDING WHAT 
HE FELT WOULD BE AN INEVITABLE BACKLASH AGAINST ARABS 
AND MUSLIMS.  ANOTHER SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF ACTION 
WAS UNCALLED FOR IN ANY SITUATION AND ASSERTED THAT 
\"TRUE MUSLIMS\" WOULD NOT HESITATE IN CONDEMNING THE 
ACTION.  STILL, THEY SAID, THE ONGOING INTIFADA IN THE 
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES HAD CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF 
RANCOR TOWARDS THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.  THEY IMPLIED 
THAT THE U.S. SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED A RESPONSE TO THE 
GROWING TENSION GIVEN ALL THE WARNINGS SENT FROM THE 
ARAB WORLD ABOUT THE DETERIORATING SITUATION.  WHILE 
IN NO WAY JUSTIFYING THE ATTACKS OR SHOWING ANY 
SATISFACTION, THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR: \"WE TOLD YOU SO.\" 
 
4.  SHORTLY AFTER NEWS OF THE ATTACKS WAS BROADCAST ON 
LOCAL MEDIA, AN AMCIT EXECUTIVE AT A LARGE SAUDI 
COMPANY REPORTED THAT HIS SAUDI COLLEAGUES AND 
SUBORDINATES REACTED WITH MIXED EMOTIONS: SOME 
EXPRESSED SHOCK AND SYMPATHY, OTHERS REACTED WITH 
GRATIFICATION THAT \"AMERICA IS FEELING PAIN,\" WHILE 
STILL OTHERS VOICED CONCERN THAT THE INCIDENTS MIGHT 
SOMEHOW INTERFERE WITH THE U.S. VISA ISSUANCE PROCESS 
AND THEIR FUTURE TRAVEL TO THE U.S. 
 
5.  ANOTHER CONTACT WHO HAS BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING 
PAN-ARAB SATELLITE VERNACULAR NEWS COVERAGE AND 
ARABIC-LANGUAGE INTERNET MESSAGE BOARDS STATED THAT 
SAUDIS AND OTHER ARABS ARE GINNING UP NUMEROUS 
CONSPIRACY THEORIES WHICH ATTRIBUTE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
THE ATTACKS TO VIRTUALLY EVERYONE EXCEPT ARABS (MOSSAD 
AGENTS, MILOSEVIC-SUPPORTING YUGOSLAVS, AND UNDERLINGS 
OF A RECENTLY-EXTRADITED COLOMBIAN DRUG LORD ARE THE 
PRIME SUSPECTS).  A NUMBER OF APPARENTLY INACCURATE 
REPORTS (E.G. EXPLOSION AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, 
DELIBERATE USG SHOOT-DOWN OF AIRLINER NEAR PITTSBURGH, 
ATTACK ON CAMP DAVID) REMAIN IN CIRCULATION.  FEARS OF 
AN ANTI-ARAB/ANTI-MUSLIM BACKLASH IN THE U.S. APPEAR 
WIDESPREAD. 
 
6.  EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS AND 
E-MAIL MESSAGES FROM SAUDI, WESTERN, AND DIPLOMATIC 
COLLEAGUES EXPRESSING SHOCK AND HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES.

SUBJECT: SAUDI ARABIA: 2001 ANNUAL TERRORISM 
REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 198912 
 
1.  FOLLOWING RESPONDS TO QUESTIONS IN REFTEL: 
 
A)  POST SHOULD HIGHLIGHT SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN BY 
HOST GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT THE GLOBAL COALITION, 
PARTICULARLY ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAIDA AND THE 
TALIBAN. 
 
RESPONSE:  THE SAUDI ARABIAN GOVERNMENT (SAG) HAS 
SUPPORTED THE GLOBAL COALITION AND HAS RESPONDED 
POSITIVELY TO VARIOUS REQUESTS FOR CONCRETE ACTION AND 
ASSISTANCE.  EXAMPLES INCLUDE PROVISION OF OVERFLIGHT 
CLEARANCE FOR AIRCRAFT INVOLVED IN OPERATION ENDURING 
FREEDOM, THE CUTTING OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE 
TALIBAN REGIME IN AFGHANISTAN, AND COOPERATION WITH 
THE U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 INCIDENTS.  IN ADDITION, SAUDI ARABIA HAS 
TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE THAT TERRORISTS ARE DENIED 
ACCESS TO THE SAUDI BANKING SYSTEM AND HAS ISSUED 
INSTRUCTIONS TO BANKS IN SAUDI ARABIA TO LOOK FOR AND 
FREEZE ACCOUNTS LISTED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
SANCTIONS COMMITTEE. 
 
B)  PLEASE PROVIDE VIVID EXAMPLES OF TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS THAT WERE THWARTED, AND TERRORIST CELLS THAT 
WERE BROKEN UP DURING 2001 WHICH ARE WELL DOCUMENTED 
AND UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE POUCH ANY PARTICULARLY 
EVOCATIVE OR DRAMATIC PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WOULD 
ILLUSTRATE THESE CASE STUDIES.  PLEASE INCLUDE THE 
NAME OF THE PUBLICATION IN WHICH THE PHOTO ORIGINALLY 
APPEARED AND THE DATE OF APPEARANCE. 
 
RESPONSE:  POST HAS NO RELEASABLE MATERIAL THAT IS 
RESPONSIVE TO THIS QUERY. 
 
C)  DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO 
ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT 
ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 2001, INCLUDING ANY 
HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM. 
 
RESPONSE:  THERE WAS ONLY ONE SIGNIFICANT ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN 2001: THE HIJACKING OF A 
TURKISH PLANE EN ROUTE TO RUSSIA IN MARCH, 2001.  THE 
ONLY JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS IN THIS CASE TO DATE HAVE 
BEEN THE DENIAL OF RUSSIA\'S AND TURKEY\'S EXTRADITION 
REQUESTS. (SEE RIYADH 0721) 
 
D)  DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION 
DURING THE YEAR? 
 
RESPONSE:  NO. 
 
E)  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS. 
 
RESPONSE: NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO 
THE SAG\'S PROSECUTION OF PEOPLE ALLEGED TO HAVE 
COMMITTED TERRORIST ACTS WITHIN SAUDI ARABIA. 
HOWEVER, THE SAG HAS FEW EXTRADITION TREATIES OUTSIDE 
OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 
ISLAMIC COUNCIL (OIC) AND THE ARAB LEAGUE. THE 
LEAGUE\'S ANTI-TERRORIST AGREEMENT, WHICH SAUDI ARABIA 
HAS RATIFIED, CONTAINS EXTRADITION ARTICLES. 
 
F)  DISCUSS HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN 
PROSECUTION.  THESE WOULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED 
TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR 
OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A TERRORIST INCIDENT 
(IN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST 
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO 
ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATION. 
 
RESPONSE: THE KING, CROWN PRINCE, MINISTER OF DEFENSE, 
MINISTER OF INTERIOR, MINISTER OF INFORMATION, SENIOR 
RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND OFFICIAL NEWS MEDIA PUBLICLY 
AND CONSISTENTLY CONDEMN TERRORISM IN UNEQUIVOCAL 
TERMS, INCLUDING BY REFUTING IDEOLOGICAL AND RELIGIOUS 
JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TERRORISM.  IN OCTOBER 2001 THE 
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS ACCEDING TO THE UN 
CONVENTION ON BLOCKING FINANCIAL ASSETS FOR TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS.  THE SAG CONTINUES ITS INVESTIGATION OF 
THE KHOBAR TOWERS BOMB ATTACK OF JUNE 1996 THAT KILLED 
19 U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL.  THE SAG IS STILL HOLDING 
A NUMBER OF SAUDI CITIZENS IN DETENTION IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE BOMBING, INCLUDING SAUDI CITIZEN HANI AL- 
SAYEGH.  NO PROSECUTION OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC LEGAL 
ACTION BEGAN IN 2001 REGARDING THE BOMBING. IN 
OCTOBER, 2000, TWO SAUDI MEN FORCED A SAUDI ARABIAN 
AIRLINES FLIGHT FROM JEDDAH TO LONDON TO LAND IN IRAQ. 
IRAQI AUTHORITIES DETAINED THE HIJACKERS AND RETURNED 
THE PASSENGERS AND AIRCRAFT TO JEDDAH.  IRAQ DENIED AN 
EXTRADITION REQUEST BY THE SAG.  NO ONE WAS HARMED IN 
THE HIJACKING.  SAUDI AUTHORITIES HAVE COMPLETED THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO A STRING OF BOMBINGS IN RIYADH AND 
THE EASTERN PROVINCE AND HAVE DETERMINED THAT THEY 
WERE CRIMINAL RATHER THAN POLITICAL IN MOTIVATION. 
 
G)  DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN 
IN 2001 BY THE HOST GOVERNMENT.  INCLUDE STEPS TAKEN 
IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED ITS FULL 
COOPERATION TO THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST 
TERRORISM.  THIS COOPERATION INCLUDES MILITARY, LEGAL 
AND PUBLIC RELATIONS. 
 
H)  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT 
FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST 
GROUPS, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS OR THEIR ACTIVITIES; 
DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION; 
MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC 
PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM; PROVISION OF 
SANCTUARY AND/OR THE PRESENCE OF OFFICES OF TERRORIST 
GROUPS; PROVISION OF TRAINING OR TRAINING SITES; 
PROVISION OF WEAPONS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON TERRORISM 
ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG DOES NOT POLITICALLY OR FINANCIALLY 
SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR 
ACTIVITIES.  ITS REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NON- 
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY 
AGENCIES OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO SOLICIT 
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL CAUSES. 
HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THESE REGULATIONS ARE 
CONSISTENTLY ENFORCED.  THERE CONTINUE TO BE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION REPRESENTATIVES SOLICIT AND COLLECT FUNDS 
FROM PRIVATE CITIZENS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
I)  HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A 
TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE SEVEN GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY 
THE SECRETARY AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ARE CUBA, 
IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA AND SUDAN.) 
 
RESPONSE: THE SAG MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUPPORTING 
ANY OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES ON THE USG\'S TERRORISM LIST 
REGARDING A TERRORIST ISSUE. 
 
J)  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 2001, 
POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC. 
WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHANGE? 
 
RESPONSE:  THE ATTITUDE OF THE SAG TOWARD TERRORISM 
DID NOT CHANGE DURING 2001. 
 
K)  DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND 
INITIATIVES WITH THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, REQUESTS TO THE HOST GOVERNMENT FOR 
SPECIFIC COOPERATION AND EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES 
IN THE HOST COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE INTERNATIONAL 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY OR IN 
SUPPORT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.  DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF 
THE HOST COUNTRY\'S COOPERATION WITH THOSE EFFORTS AND 
INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT HAS SATISFIED THE SPECIFIC REQUESTS. 
 
RESPONSE: FOLLOWING A 1995 BOMBING THAT KILLED U.S. 
MILITARY PERSONNEL ADVISING THE SAUDI ARABIAN NATIONAL 
GUARD (OPM/SANG), A USG INTERAGENCY COUNTERTERRORISM 
TEAM VISITED SAUDI ARABIA TO BEGIN UNPRECEDENTED, 
COORDINATED, INTERAGENCY CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE USG 
AND SAG ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY ISSUES.  THIS 
COOPERATION, WHICH ENGENDERED HIGH-LEVEL SAG INTEREST 
AND THE PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE SAG MINISTRIES, HAS 
CONTINUED THROUGHOUT 2001.  THE USG AND SAG CONTINUE 
TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON COUNTERTERRORISM AND 
SECURITY ISSUES AFFECTING AMERICAN AND SAUDI INTERESTS 
IN THE REGION.  CONSULTATIONS AND TRAINING FOR SAUDI 
COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED 
STATES ALSO OCCURRED.  IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 
ATTACKS, U.S. AND SAUDI OFFICIALS HAVE MET IN THE 
CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE TRANS- 
NATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO TERRORIST GROUPS 
DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY.  THE FBI COORDINATES ITS 
INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS WITH THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR 
AND MAINTAINS A PERMANENTLY STAFFED LEGAL ATTACHE 
OFFICE IN THE U.S. EMBASSY.  IN OCTOBER, 2001, AN 
APPARENT SUICIDE BOMB EXPLODED IN AL-KHOBAR, KILLING 
ONE AMERICAN AND WOUNDING ANOTHER.  THE SAG 
INVESTIGATION HAS SINCE REVEALED THAT THE BOMBER WAS A 
PALESTINIAN, ACTING ALONE, FOR UNVERIFIED MOTIVES 
RELATING TO THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA. 
 
L)  IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL INFORMATION, IF THE 
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN 
THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS 
OR INTERESTS, PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: 
 
     I.  THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 
2001 COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED 
STATES GOVERNMENT IN APPREHENDING, CONVICTING, AND 
PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE ACT; AND 
 
     II.  THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 
2001 COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING IN PREVENTING 
FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES 
CITIZENS IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
RESPONSE: (I)  THE SAG HAS COOPERATED FULLY IN 
INVESTIGATING PARTICIPATION OF SAUDI CITIZENS IN THE 
SEPTEMBER ATTACKS AND CONTINUES TO COORDINATE WITH USG 
OFFICIALS IN EFFORTS TO HALT THE FLOW OF FUNDS TO 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
 
   (II) THE SAG CONTINUES TO DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE HUMAN 
AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECT USG PERSONNEL AND 
INTERESTS FOLLOWING THE OPM/SANG, KHOBAR TOWERS, EAST 
AFRICA BOMBINGS, AND THREATS TO THE U.S. EMBASSY, 
CONSULATES AND OTHER U.S. INTERESTS IN 2001.  IT MADE 
AVAILABLE TO COALITION FORCES THE PRINCE SULTAN 
AIRBASE AT AL KHARJ, WHERE MOST U.S. SERVICEMEN IN 
SAUDI ARABIA ARE NOW LOCATED, AND A RESIDENTIAL 
COMPOUND, KNOWN AS ESKAN VILLAGE, SOUTH OF RIYADH FOR 
MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DOD PERSONNEL.  THE SAG SPENT 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FACILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE SECURITY.  THE SAG ALSO WORKED 
WITH AMERICAN SECURITY PERSONNEL IN AN ONGOING EFFORT 
TO ENHANCE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AT ALL OTHER USG 
FACILITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA, INCLUDING THE U.S. EMBASSY 
IN RIYADH AND THE CONSULATES IN JEDDAH AND DHAHRAN. 
USG AND SAG OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY TO 
REVIEW THE SAFETY OF AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
M)  IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT 
COOPERATION DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE 
PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, PLEASE DESCRIBE 
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 2001 
COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF 
TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY.

SUBJECT: RIYADH GOVERNOR ON ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND REGIONAL 
CONFLICTS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Robert W. Jordan for 
reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  An exceptionally cordial and frank Riyadh 
Governor Prince Salman told the Ambassador on September 16 
that Muslim fanatics were damaging the image of Islam and 
Saudi Arabia and engendering hatred amongst peoples.  He 
acknowledged that preachers who taught hatred of others bore 
some responsibility for terrorist acts, but said there were 
other sources of hatred infecting the minds of people in the 
region, most notably unjust treatment of Palestinians. 
Prince Salman affirmed commitment to the U.S.-Saudi 
relationship, saying that stability and prosperity of the 
region depended on successful U.S. policies.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) During a farewell call on senior ruling family member 
and Governor of Riyadh Province Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz 
Al Saud, the Governor told the Ambassador that he and senior 
Saudi officials were aware of the problem of misuse of 
Islamic charitable funds well before September 11, 2001.  His 
remarks were prompted by the Ambassador\'s opening observation 
on the good progress our governments are making on the issue 
of terrorism financing.  Prince Salman said that he and other 
senior princes worked in the 90\'s to bring all the charitable 
organizations under one umbrella because they knew there was 
nothing to ensure that money given in good faith for 
charitable projects went to deserving causes.  While he 
believed that much good was being done by the charities, he 
also had concerns that some money was going to terrorists and 
\"maybe even to casinos\". 
 
3. (C)  Prince Salman condemned those whose \"deformed 
actions\" had first and foremost damaged Muslims and Arabs. 
The image of Islam and its \"beautiful values\" had been 
tarnished and feelings of hatred between those of different 
religions were being fanned.  The Governor described how he 
had personally opened a number of Islamic Centers in the 
West, including in the strongly Catholic cities of Rome and 
Madrid, with the participation of Christian and Jewish 
leaders as well as the political leadership of those 
countries.  Such efforts to promote cooperation and 
understanding were being reversed.  Extremists seemed to be 
setting the agenda. 
 
4. (C)  The Muslim extremists, called fundamentalists in the 
West, were not fundamentalists but in fact were a phenomenon 
seen before in Islam and in other religions.  Calling the 
extremists \"Kharijites\", Prince Salman said they were hurting 
the cause of Islam.  (Note:  Kharijites is a loaded 
historical term that can be translated literally as \"outlaws\" 
but refers directly to the earliest schismatics in Islamic 
history whose principal role in the historical record is the 
fomenting of turmoil and insurrections.  End Note.)  Salman 
said that the followers of Usama bin Ladin were kin to the 
assassins of Rabin and Ghandi and individuals who had 
assassinated American leaders.  The true religious men of 
Saudi Arabia were known for their abhorrence of violence and 
for their refusal to ever lay hands on a weapon. 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador commented that those whose religious 
teachings encouraged hatred of others bore some 
responsibility for encouraging terrorists.  Salman agreed and 
said Crown Prince Abdullah was making sure that all religious 
teachers understood that.  There were many other sources of 
hatred as well though he commented.  The current situation in 
the Palestinian territories was causing hatred.  Everyone 
condemned UBL, but wasn\'t Israeli PM Sharon also sheltering 
and giving encouragement to extremists and hatemongers? 
Salman said he was one of Americans biggest admirers and 
supporters in the Kingdom, but he despaired at the impact 
U.S. actions towards the Palestinian cause was having on the 
U.S. image.  Abu Mazen had resigned as PA Prime Minister when 
it became clear that he was being failed by Israel, by the 
Palestinian Authority, and by the U.S.  Prince Salman said he 
hoped he was wrong but he thought that Abu Ala\'a would also 
fail as PM and the U.S. and Israel would have to back to 
Yasser Arafat.  With evident disgust, Salman said that recent 
Israeli and U.S. policies towards Arafat had made him a 
bigger hero than ever. 
 
6. (C) Prince Salman said that U.S. actions in Iraq were also 
short-sighted.  He hated Saddam Hussein with a passion, \"but 
there was no need for this war\".  U.S. actions in 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Palestine were all melding the public 
perception and the U.S. was being sucked into insoluble 
issues that would damage its interests and the interests of 
its friends in the region.  The Palestinian issue was the 
core issue, Salman argued.  Tackling it would begin to 
extricate the U.S. from the problems it faced in the region. 
He concluded by saying that he sincerely wished for the 
success of President Bush who had inherited difficult 
problems and then been called upon to respond to the events 
of 9/11.  Saudi interests were aligned with U.S. interests 
and success and prosperity for the U.S. meant the same for 
Saudi Arabia.

SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCING: AL-RAJHI BANK 
 
Classified By: ECON CONS D. H. RUNDELL, REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY: At the end of the meeting between Treasury 
A/S Zarate and Ali Al-Gaith, Director of Banking Inspection, 
Insurance and Financial Leasing at the Saudi Arabian Monetary 
Agency (SAMA) on September 15, Al-Gaith discussed Al-Rajhi 
Bank and the recent information forwarded to the SAG via July 
5 letters from the Ambassador. Al-Gaith argued against 
Al-Rajhi being involved in terrorism. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S) Al-Gaith took exception to the details regarding 
suspect accounts and said that he had seen no hard evidence 
linking Al-Rajhi or individuals who have accounts or work at 
the bank with Al-Qaida or terrorism. He noted that the 
investigation into Al-Rajhi had started in 1989. The suspect 
activity is an \"after-the-fact\" revelation for Al-Gaith, that 
is after terrorists are identified. For him, no complicity 
on the bank\'s part has been proven. 
 
3. (S) In August, 2003, Al-Rajhi had a full scope 
examination done by Ernst & Young. The report did not 
indicate any wrong doings. A/S Zarate requested a copy of 
the report. Al-Gaith said he would share the findings of the 
examination. 
 
4. (S) Relying on news reports regarding the Al-Rajhi 
family is not a basis, according to Al-Gaith, for making 
claims concerning the bank. Al-Gaith defended the banks past 
practices such as freezing Usama bin Laden\'s accounts in 1994. 
 
5. (S) Zarate noted that the United States Government (USG) 
has real concerns about the financial activities facilitated 
by Al-Rajhi and that these concerns were not an indictment 
against the SAG. Rather, the issue is of common concern and 
needs to be addressed. The USG and SAG need to be assured 
that Al-Rajhi is doing everything possible regarding 
compliance and cooperation. Particular accounts of concern 
need to be investigated and the bank\'s compliance structure 
needs to be reviewed. Al-Gaith said that information on 
suspect accounts would be shared. 
 
6. (S) Al-Gaith pointed out that the MOI information 
originated with SAMA. He said that SAMA would look at 
specific accounts if the USG provided information. Zarate 
said he would follow up on the offer to provide specific 
accounts. 
 
7. (S) COMMENT: Al-Gaith did not appear to support a close 
relationship with the United States Government (USG) 
throughout the meeting (reftel). At the beginning of the 
conversation, Al-Gaith said that he was \"fed up\" with the 
USG\'s allegations and that none of them were substantiated.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, PREL, SA 
SUBJECT: SAUDI ARABIA: 2004 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 245841 
 
1. (U) Per reftel, post submits the following language for 
use in the 2004 Patterns of Global Terrorism Report.  Embassy 
POC for this report is Julie Eadeh (eadehja@state.gov). 
 
2. (U) During the year, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continued 
to support the global war on terror.  Al Qai\'da, in the first 
half of 2004, kept up a steady tempo of attacks--surpassing 
the variety and lethality of the previous year.  This trend 
contrasted sharply with the second half of 2004 in which the 
network remained largely on the defensive, and until 
December, was unable to mount an operation.  In 2004, 
terrorists killed many foreigners and citizens, including 6 
Americans, in attacks throughout the country.  The attacks 
consisted of kidnappings, targeted shootings, bombings, and 
beheadings.  The media reported widely on each of the attacks 
and the subsequent government crackdown, leading to a 
widespread acceptance that terrorism is a serious threat in 
the Kingdom, not only to foreigners, but to Saudis as well. 
 
3. (U) In response to the increasing wave of terrorist 
violence in the Kingdom, the Saudi government continued its 
pursuit of al-Qai\'da and other terrorist operatives.  While 
experiencing casualties among security forces, Saudi 
authorities aggressively pursued terrorists and achieved 
successes.  The Government continued to publicize 
counterterrorism efforts.  Saudi authorities conducted 
high-level dialogues with U.S. officials on counterterrorism 
efforts and responded positively to requests for heightened 
security in facilities around the country. 
 
4. (U) Saudi Arabia continued a hearts and minds campaign in 
the war against terror.  During the year, Saudi authorities 
aired militant confessions and interviews with fathers of 
wanted men as part of a campaign to rally the public against 
radicals who carried out attacks in the Kingdom.  In June, 
the Grand Mufti Shaykh Abd al-Aziz Al al-Shaykh issued a 
fatwa condemning terrorist acts and calling on citizens to 
report \"saboteurs and anyone planning or preparing to carry 
out terrorist acts to the concerned authorities.\"  Also in 
June, six senior religious leaders issued a statement 
denouncing terrorist attacks as \"heinous crimes\" and the 
Crown Prince delivered a speech emphasizing the important 
role every Saudi must play in combating terrorism. 
 
5. (U) As Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Mecca and 
Medina, the Saudi government worked to undermine the use of 
Islam to justify terrorist attacks.  The authorities worked 
during the year to delegitimize and discredit those who use 
Islam to justify terrorism.  Senior members of the Royal 
Family emphasized that the fight against terror is paramount 
to state security and the well-being of all Saudis.  There 
were television broadcasts during the year discussing the 
costs of terrorism and the importance of security from an 
Islamic perspective.  The Government also focused on internal 
social, political, and economic reforms as a method to combat 
underlying roots of terrorism. 
 
6. (U) During the year, the Government launched intensive 
searches and counterterrorism sweeps in the country, often 
involving thousands of Saudi security personnel.  On June 23, 
Crown Prince Abdullah issued an ultimatum to terrorists: 
surrender in 30 days or suffer the full force of the state. 
On June 29, Prince Nayif Security Academy began training 
ARAMCO employees on counterterrorism measures.  On the same 
day, the Ministry of Interior announced a 60 day pardon for 
persons to surrender unlicensed weapons.  During the year, 
the media reported that Saudi border guards seized large 
amounts of explosives and small arms on their Yemeni and 
Iraqi borders. 
 
7. (U) The judicial system remains capable of dealing with 
the terrorist threat as outlined in the U.N. Counterterrorism 
Committee Report.  The Saudi government detained those found 
responsible for terrorist attacks, and in some cases, 
executed terrorists.  The Government generally seeks 
extradition of their nationals involved in terrorist acts. 
The Saudi government continues to press Iran to extradite 
terror suspects believed to be held there. 
8. (U) During the year, the Government engaged in close 
counterterrorism cooperation with the U.S., and other 
international efforts.  The Government forbade the collection 
of cash donations at mosques or commercial establishments. 
In addition, the Saudi government restricted certain deposit, 
withdrawal, and out of country financial transfers of 
charities.  The media reported during the year that Saudi 
banks froze more than 250,000 accounts for noncompliance with 
anti-money laundering and terrorist finance laws.  In August, 
Crown Prince Abdullah told the foreign press that Saudi 
Arabia has made significant progress in decapitating the 
terrorist leadership in the Kingdom and is focusing on 
hunting down the individuals comprising the terrorist cells. 
At the United Nations General Assembly in September, the 
Saudi government announced that it would hold an 
international conference to combat terrorism in February 
2005. 
 
9. (U) A 2003 anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist 
financing law criminalized money laundering and terrorist 
financing.  The law also established a single Financial 
Intelligence Unit (FIU), as required by the Financial Action 
Task Force (FATF), to collect and analyze suspicious 
financial transactions and places stringent \"Know Your 
Customer\" requirements on the banking system.  In July, the 
FATF released its 15th annual report which noted that the 
Saudi government \"has taken action to increase requirements 
for financial institutions on customer due diligence, 
established systems for tracing and freezing terrorist 
assets, and tightened the regulation and transparency of 
charitable organizations.\"  After an October ultimatum, the 
Government closed down the al-Haramain Foundation.  During
