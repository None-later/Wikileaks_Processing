1.  ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND POLICIES: 
- 
2.  RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE:  SOMALIA IS A LARGE, 
SPARSELY SETTLED COUNTRY OF 5 MILLION PEOPLE, WHOSE 
MAJOR RESOURCES ARE ITS LAND AND LOCATION.  SITUATED 
ADJACENT TO THE MARKETS OF THE PERSIAN GULF, AND 
WITHIN EASY SHIPPING RANGE OF EUROPE, SOMALIA POSSESSES 
A LAND AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 64 MILLION HECTARES. 
OF THIS, ABOUT 8.2 MILLION HECTARES ARE ARABLE, BUT, 
WITH WATER AND AGRICULTURAL LABOR LIMITING FACTORS 
ONLY ABOUT 900,000 HECTARES ARE UNDER CULTIVATION.  OF 
THE REMAINING LAND, ABOUT 60 PERCENT IS SUTIABLE FOR 
GRAZING WITH THE BALANCE WASTE.  ITS FISHING POTENTIAL 
AND MINERAL RESOURCES REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN AND UN- 
EXPLOITED, THOUGH SIX FOREIGN OIL COMPANIES ARE 
CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN SURVEYS AND EXPLORATION.  THE 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE  BASE IS WEAK, WITH ONLY TWO 
MAJOR URBAN CENTERS (MOGADISHU AND HARGEISA), THREE 
DEEPWATER PORTS (MOGADISHU, KISMAYO AND BERBERA), A 
POORLY DEVELOPED INTERNAL ROAD NETWORK, AND NO RAILROAD. 
PUBLIC UTILITY, EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTH SERVICES ARE 
LARGELY CONFINED TO THE MAJOR CITIES.  THE HUMAN 
RESOURCE BASE IS ALSO WEAK, WITH MANAGERIAL AND 
TECHNICAL SKILLS PARTICULARLY SCARCE. 
- 
3. STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY:  THE ECONOMY IS DOMINATED 
BY THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, AND WITHIN AGRICULTURE BY 
LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION.  OVERALL GDP (AT CURRENT MARKET 
PRICES) WAS ABOUT US DOLS 1.3 BILLION IN 1983; WITH A 
POPULATION (INCLUDING REFUGEES) OF 5 MILLION, PER 
CAPITA GDP WAS ABOUT US DOLS 260.  LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION 
NORMALLY ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 38 PERCENT OF GDP; 50-60 
PERCENT OF TOTAL EMPLOYMENT AND 80 PERCENT OF EXPORT 
EARNINGS.  CROP PRODUCTION CONTRIBUTES ABOUT 7-10 
PERCENT OF GDP, WITH BANANAS THE ONLY IMPORTANT EXPORT 
CROP, AND SORGHUM, MAIZE AND SESAME GROWN FOR LOCAL 
CONSUMPTION.  THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS SMALL 
(7 PERCENT OF GDP), INEFFICIENT, AND DOMINATED BY 
38 PUBLIC CORPORATIONS, WHICH NOW ACCOUNT FOR 80 PER- 
CENT OF ALL VALUE ADDED IN MANUFACTURING.  DESPITE 
CHANGES UNDERWAY, SERVICES ARE STILL DOMINATED BY 
PUBLIC CORPORATIONS, WITH BANKING, INSURANCE AND 
PORTIONS OF IMPORT AND EXPORT TRADE THE PROVINCE OF 
PUBLIC SECTOR MONOPOLIES.  REMITTANCES REMAIN AN 
IMPORTANT FACTOR IN NATIONAL INCOME, WITH TRANSFERS 
FROM 100,000 SOMALIS NOW WORKING IN THE GULF ACCOUNT- 
ING IN PAST YEARS FOR UP TO ONE-THIRD OF SOMALIA\'S 
TOTAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS 
RELATIVELY STABLE.  IN PLACE FOR 15 YEARS, WITH THE 
SECURITY SERVICES UNDER FIRM CONTROL, IT HAS THUS FAR 
WEATHERED SUCCESSFULLY DROUGHTS, WARS AND REFUGEE 
CRISES, AND, MORE RECENTLY, ETHIOPIAN MILITARY 
PRESSURES ON THE BORDER AND ATTACKS ON NORTHERN 
TERRITORIES BY DISSIDENT  GROUPS   BASED IN ETHIOPIA. 
- 
4. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS:  SOMALIA\'S OVERALL 
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE HAS DETERIORATED BADLY OVER THE 
PAST TWO YEARS AS A SERIES OF BLOWS TO ITS EXTERNAL 
ACCOUNT HAVE COMBINED WITH BURGEONING FISCAL DEFICITS 
TO RECREATE THE LOW GROWTH, HIGH INFLATION ENVIRONMENT 
THAT HAD PREVAILED IN THE LATE 1970S.  WITH EXPORT 
EARNINGS CUT TO LESS THAN HALF THEIR 1982 LEVEL 
(LARGELY AS A RESULT OF SAUDI ARABIA\'S 1983 BAN ON 
CATTLE IMPORTS FROM AFRICA) AND FOREIGN AID FINANCING 
DOWN 18 PERCENT FROM ITS 1982 PEAK, SOMALIA CLOSED 
1984 WITH ITS SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE OVERALL BALANCE OF 
PAYMENTS DEFICIT, A NEGATIVE NET FOREIGN ASSETS 
POSITION AND GROSS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES EQUAL TO 
BARELY SIX WEEKS OF CASH FINANCED IMPORTS.  DEPRESSED 
BY IMPORT SHORTAGES AND WEAK RAINS, REAL GDP GROWTH 
IN 1983 SLIPPED TO ONLY 1 PERCENT AND SEEMS IN 1984 
LIKELY TO HAVE TOTALLED NO MORE THAN 1 TO 2 PERCENT, 
EVEN WITH STRONG RAINS AND RECORD CROP PRODUCTION. 
INFLATION, MEANWHILE, HAS SOARED, RISING FROM AN 
AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF 24 PERCENT IN 1982 TO 36 PER- 
CENT IN 1983 AND 93 PERCENT IN 1984. 
- 
5. LOOKING AHEAD TO 1985, PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH AND 
PRICE STABILITY WILL DEPEND UPON THE WEATHER, 
SOMALIA\'S SUCCESS IN MUSTERING INTERNATIONAL AID 
SUPPORT FOR ITS PROPOSED IMF STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT, 
AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S CAPACITY TO MAINTAIN ITS 
COMMITMENT TO THE ECONOMIC REFORM PROCESS.  IF THE 
POLITICAL COMMITMENT IS FIRM, THE RAINS ADEQUATE, 
AID SUPPORT SUFFICIENT, SOMALIA MAY BE ABLE TO WORK 
THROUGH ITS PROPOSED STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT TOWARDS 
CONSISTENT, EXPORT LED GROWTH.  IF NOT, SOMALIA 
COULD WELL REMAIN TRAPPED WITHIN THE LOW GROWTH, 
HIGH INFLATION VORTEX INTO WHICH IT STUMBLED IN 
1983 AND 1984. 
- 
6. ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE, A WORLD BANK SPONSORED 
CONSULTATIVE GROUP MEETING ON SOMALIA IN OCTOBER 
1983 PROVIDED THE STIMULUS FOR AN INITIAL REVIEW OF 
SOMALIA\'S PUBLIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM, WHICH THE WORLD 
BANK HAS SINCE FOLLOWED UP WITH STAFF VISITS 
THROUGHOUT 1984.  AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 1985, THE 
RESULT OF THESE REPEATED REVIEWS IS A PUBLIC INVEST- 
MENT PROGRAM LARGELY FREE OF THE WHITE ELEPHANTS 
THAT HAD PLAGUED PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT PLANS, BUT 
STILL OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE COUNTRY\'S REAL FISCAL 
AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESOURCES.  RETURNS ON IN- 
VESTMENT HAVE BEEN ABSURDLY LOW OVER THE PAST 13 
YEARS (BELOW 6.7 PERCENT PER ANNUM ON AVERAGE TO JUDGE 
FROM GDP GROWTH AND NATIONAL INVESTMENT RATES) AND 
LIKELY WILL REMAIN LOW IN COMING YEARS, IF MORE CARE- 
FUL CONTROL IS NOT EXERTED OVER THE DISTRIBUTION AND 
USE OF INVESTMENT FUNDS.  A SECOND CONSULTATIVE GROUP 
MEETING NOW TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 1985 
WILL PROVIDE DONORS WITH A SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO  IN- 
FLUENCE THIS PROCESS. 
- 
7. POLICY FRAMEWORK:  SOMALIA HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT 
STEPS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS TO ESTABLISH THE 
INCENTIVES, OPPORTUNITIES AND FREE OPERATING 
ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF A 
MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMIC SYSTEM.  IT HAS ENDED 
PRICE CONTROLS, VIRTUALLY ABOLISHED IMPORT AND EXPORT 
LICENSING, DEVALUED REPEATEDLY (BY A TOTAL OF 83 PER- 
CENT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TERMS), AND, IN JANUARY 1985, 
ESTABLISHED A DUAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET WITH A 
FREE AND LEGAL PARALLEL MARKET FOR MOST FOREIGN EX- 
CHANGE TRANSACTIONS.  IT HAS ALSO BOOSTED BANKING 
SYSTEM LOAN AND DEPOSIT RATES BY 8 TO 10 POINTS (IN 
TWO STAGES OVER THREE YEARS), AND COMPLETELY LIBERAL- 
IZED INTERNAL FOODGRAIN MARKETING.  HOWEVER, IT HAS 
NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY BACK THESE REFORMS 
WITH THE REQUISITE FISCAL AND MONETARY DISCIPLINE. 
REAL INTEREST RATES REMAIN NEGATIVE, AND THE EFFECTS 
OF PAST DEVALUATIONS HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY WIPED OUT 
BY EXCESSIVE MONETARY EXPANSION.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
ALSO BEEN SLOW TO ATTACK INTERNAL MONOPOLY POSITIONS. 
WHILE IT HAS ENDED MOST PUBLIC SECTOR TRADING MONO- 
POLIES, IT HAS LEFT IN PLACE MONOPOLIES IN BANKING, 
INSURANCE, MANUFACTURING, AND OTHER SECTORS OF THE 
ECONOMY.  IT HAS ALSO LEFT IN PLACE AN UNREALISTIC 
(THOUGH LARGELY UNENFORCED) LABOR CODE WMICH OFFICIALLY 
DEPRIVES EMPLOYERS OF THE RIGHT TO HIRE AND FIRE AS 
THEY PLEASE.  OVERALL, THEREFORE, WHILE SOMALIA HAS 
TAKEN MANY OF THE BASIC AND MOST CRITICAL STEPS TOWARDS 
A FREELY OPERATING MARKET ECONOMY OVER THE PAST THREE 
YEARS, IT STILL NEEDS TO COMPLETE THE TASK WITH 
ADJUSTMENTS IN INTERNAL MARKET CONDITIONS, AND IMPROVE- 
MENTS IN GENERAL PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT.

9. POLICY INDICATORS 
 
10. MONEY SUPPLY:  FISCAL DEFICITS, ONLY PARTIALLY 
OFFSET BY CONSEQUENTIAL DECLINES IN NET FOREIGN ASSETS, 
HAVE PROVIDED THE MAJOR IMPETUS FOR MONEY SUPPLY 
GROWTH IN SOMALIA OVER THE PAST TWELVE YEARS. 
THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS PATTERN WAS DURING THE 1981 
TO 1983 PERIOD, WHEN, UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF A SERIES 
OF IMF PROGRAMS, NEW NET CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
ACCOUNTED FOR VIRTUALLY ALL MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH.  WHEN 
SOMALIA\'S IMF PROGRAMS LAPSED IN 1984, HOWEVER, 
GOVERNMENT DEMAND FOR CREDIT REASSERTED ITSELF, ALONE 
ACCOUNTING FOR TWO-THIRDS OF A 72 PERCENT INCREASE IN 
NET DOMESTIC CREDIT DURING THE YEAR\'S FIRST NINE 
MONTHS.

NET FOREIGN ASSETS               - 156.1     -2372.4 
- 
12. MONETARY POLICY INSTRUMENTS:  SOMALIA OPERATES 
A RELATIVELY SIMPLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM CONSISTING OF 
A CENTRAL BANK, A COMMERCIAL BANK, A DEVELOPMENT 
BANK AND A SINGLE INSURANCE COMPANY, ALL GOVERNMENT 
OWNED.  THE CENTRAL BANK TENDS TO RELY UPON QUANTI- 
TATIVE CONTROLS ON CREDIT ALLOCATIONS TO CONTROL 
THE MONEY SUPPLY.  THE CENTRAL BANK ALSO HAS POWERS 
TO FIX INTEREST RATES AND ADJUST COMMERCIAL BANK 
RESERVE REQUIREMENTS (NOW 10 PERCENT).  HOWEVER, IT 
HAS NOT ADJUSTED RESERVE REQUIREMENTS SINCE 1972, 
AND INTEREST RATES, WHILE ADJUSTED UPWARDS IN RECENT 
YEARS, REMAIN NEGATIVE IN REAL TERMS AND INEFFECTIVE 
IN CONTROLLING THE MONEY SUPPLY.  THERE IS NO MONEY 
MARKET OR OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS IN SOMALIA. 
- 
13. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND MARKET POLICIES: 
SOMALIA NOW OPERATES A DUAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
MARKET.  THE OFFICIAL MARKET, WHICH IS FUNDED 
BY GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND LOANS AND 35 PERCENT OF 
ALL EXPORT EARNINGS, PROVIDES FINANCING FOR ALL 
DEBT AND OTHER OFFICIAL SERVICE PAYMENTS AND FOR 
ALL PUBLIC SECTOR OIL IMPORTS.  THE EXCHANGE RATE 
IN THIS MARKET IS NOW 36:1 (SHILLINGS TO DOLLARS) 
AND IS ADJUSTED UPWARDS MONTHLY BY HALF A SHILLING 
PLUS THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN SOMALIA\'S CONSUMER 
PRICE INDEX AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE IN- 
FLATION RATES OF THE FIVE SDR BASKET CURRENCIES. 
- 
14.  ALL OTHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS; I.E., 
ALL TRANSACTIONS NOT SPECIFICALLY ASSIGNED TO THE 
OFFICIAL MARKET, ARE COVERED IN A LEGAL PARALLEL 
MARKET, WHICH IS FUNDED BY PRIVATE TRANSFERS AND 
RETAINED EXPORT EARNINGS (65 PERCENT OF ALL EARN- 
INGS).  ALL TRANSACTIONS IN THIS MARKET TAKE PLACE 
THROUGH FOREIGN AND LOCAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS OF THE 
COMMERCIAL AND SAVINGS BANK, WHICH CAN BE OPENED 
BY ANY RESIDENT (FOREIGNER OR NATIONAL) OF SOMALIA. 
THE EXCHANGE RATE IN THIS MARKET FLOATS, WITH THE 
COMMERCIAL AND SAVINGS BANK SETTING A DAILY RATE 
FOR ITS OWN TRANSACTIONS AT THE AVERAGE OF THE 
PREVIOUS DAY\'S MARKET TRANSACTIONS.  STARTING AT 
75:1 (SHILLINGS TO DOLLARS), THIS BANK RATE HAS 
MOVED TO 82 IN THE THREE WEEKS SINCE THIS NEW 
MARKET WAS ESTABLISHED ON JANUARY 2, 1985, AND WILL 
EVENTUALLY APPROACH THE REAL CURRENT PARALLEL MARKET 
RATE OF 93 TO 95:1. 
- 
15. EXCHANGE CONTROLS IN SOMALIA INCLUDE DIRECT 
RESTRICTIONS ON REMITTANCES OF PROFITS, EARNINGS 
AND CAPITAL, AND A LICENSING REQUIREMENT FOR ALL 
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  UNDER SOMALIA\'S CURRENT 
INVESTMENT LAW, REGISTERED INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE 
DEEMED \"PRODUCTIVE\" ARE ENTITLED TO REMIT ANNUALLY 
EARNINGS EQUIVALENT TO 30 PERCENT OF INVESTED 
CAPITAL; \"NON-PRODUCTIVE\" INVESTMENTS ARE PERMITTED 
NO REMITTANCES FOR THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS, AND 
REMITTANCES ANNUALLY EQUIVALENT TO ONLY 10 PERCENT 
OF INVESTED CAPITAL.  WAGE EARNINGS OF FOREIGN 
WORKERS, SIMILARLY, ARE RESTRICTED TO 50 PERCENT 
OF ANNUAL INCOME.  ALL OF THESE RESTRICTIONS 
REMAIN IN EFFECT UNDER SOMALIA\'S NEW DUAL FOREIGN 
EXCHANGE MARKET SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF ACCOUNT 
ARRANGEMENTS AT THE COMMERCIAL BANK, THESE RESTRIC- 
TIONS EFFECTIVELY APPLY ONLY TO THOSE FUNDS WHICH 
ORIGINALLY ARRIVED IN COUNTRY AS EXPORT PROCEEDS. 
- 
16. GOVERNMENT BUDGET OPERATIONS:  CENTRAL GOVERN- 
MENT OPERATIONS HAVE ABSORBED A HIGH AND INCREASING 
PERCENTAGE OF GDP IN SOMALIA.  BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980, 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES ABSORBED AN AVERAGE 
OF 22.6 PERCENT OF GDP ANNUALLY, A PERCENTAGE WHICH 
ROSE TO 26.3 PERCENT BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983.  REVENUES, 
HOWEVER, HAVE NOT KEPT PACE, AVERAGING 15.3 PERCENT 
OF GDP IN BOTH PERIODS.  DEFICITS IN BOTH PERIODS 
WERE FINANCED PRIMARILY BY FOREIGN GRANTS AND LOANS. 
IN THE EARLIER PERIOD, HOWEVER, THIS FOREIGN 
FINANCING WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY SIZEABLE BANKING 
SYSTEM CREDITS, A REQUIREMENT THAT WAS ELIMINATED 
BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983 BEFORE REAPPEARING IN 1984.

19. TAXATION:  SOMALIA RAISES THE VAST MAJORITY 
OF ITS CENTRAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE FROM TAXES ON 
TRADE AND TRANSACTIONS.  ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY 
GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES, TAXES ON INCOME AND PROFIT 
IN 1983 ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 4 PERCENT OF TOTAL 
REVENUE; PROPERTY TAXES CONTRIBUTED 5 PERCENT; WHILE 
LEVIES ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES AND DEPARTMENTAL 
SURPLUSES ACCOUNTED FOR 17 PERCENT.  THE BALANCE 
WAS COVERED BY TAXES ON IMPORTS (51 PERCENT OF TOTAL 
REVENUE), EXPORTS (3 PERCENT), EXCISE TAXES (12 
PERCENT) AND STAMP TAXES (6.8 PERCENT).  RATES 
VARIED BY SOURCE.  ON PERSONAL INCOME EARNED FROM 
EMPLOYMENT, TAX RATES RANGED FROM ZERO FOR EARNINGS 
LESS THAN US DOLS 6  PER MONTH TO 18.9 PERCENT FOR 
EARNINGS ABOVE US DOLS 42 PER MONTH.  FOR OTHER 
PERSONAL INCOME, RATES RANGE FROM ZERO FOR EARNINGS 
LESS THAN US DOLS 67 PER YEAR TO 30 PERCENT FOR EARN- 
INGS ABOVE US DOLS 835 PER YEAR.  PRIVATE CORPORATE 
PROFITS ARE TAXED AT A FLAT 35 PERCENT RATE. 
SPECIFIC EXCISE TAXES ARE LEVIED ON SUGAR, TOBACCO, 
MATCHES, BEVERAGES, MINERAL WATER, SOAP AND SHAMPOO; 
A GENERAL 5 PERCENT SALES TAX HAS ALSO BEEN DEVELOPED 
WHICH WILL APPLY TO ALL BUT ESSENTIAL GOODS. 
CUSTOMS DUTIES AVERAGE 60-65 PERCENT OF THE VALUE OF 
DUTIABLE MERCHANDISE AND ARE APPLIED AT RATES THAT 
RANGE FROM ZERO TO OVER 100 PERCENT ON 120 PERCENT 
OF THE L/C VALUE OF IMPORTED COMMODITIES VALUED 
AT AN ADMINISTRATIVE RATE OF 60:1 (SHILLINGS TO 
DOLLARS).  EXPORT TAXES ARE APPLIED ON ALL MAJOR 
EXPORTS AT RATES RANGING UP TO 30 PERCENT OF FOB 
VALUE.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND STATISTICAL TAXES ARE 
ALSO APPLIED AT A 10 PERCENT AD VALOREM RATE TO ALL 
IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.  TAXES ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES 
INCLUDE A TURNOVER TAX (APPLIED AT A RATE OF 50 
PERCENT ON NET PROFIT), A PROFIT TAX (APPLIED AT A 
35 PERCENT RATE AFTER DEDUCTION OF THE TURNOVER TAX) 
AND A 50 PERCENT GOVERNMENT SHARE IN ANNUAL DEPRECIA- 
TION ALLOWANCES. 
- 
20. PRICING POLICIES:  CONSUMER PRICES:  SOMALIA 
OFFICIALLY ENDED ALL CONSUMER PRICE CONTROLS IN 
JANUARY 1985.  OIL PRODUCTS WHICH ARE IMPORTED BY 
A GOVERNMENT TRADING AGENCY OPERATING AT THE OFFICIAL 
(36:1) EXCHANGE RATE, ARE STILL AVAILABLE AT WHAT 
AMOUNTS TO SUBSIDIZED PRICES (E.G., 17 SHILLINGS PER 
LITER OF GASOLINE).  ALL OTHER PRICES, HOWEVER, 
INCLUDING PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY AND WATER, HAVE 
BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT FULL COSTS AT THE PARALLEL 
MARKET RATE OF EXCHANGE. 
- 
21. PRODUCER PRICES:  AGRICULTURAL MARKETS AND PRICES 
WERE LARGELY DECONTROLLED BY SOMALIA IN JANUARY 1984, 
AND, IN THE YEAR SINCE, BASIC FOOD PRICES HAVE RISEN 
TO MARKET RATES.  THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 
CORPORATION, THE GOVERNMENT TRADING AGENCY WHICH 
PREVIOUSLY HELD A MONOPSONY ON ALL GRAIN PURCHASES 
IN SOMALIA, STILL HOLDS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO PURCHASE 
UP TO 5 PERCENT OF EACH YEAR\'S CROP, BUT HAS NOT 
EXERCISED THAT RIGHT IN RECENT YEARS.  BANANA EXPORTS 
FROM SOMALIA ARE ENTIRELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF A 
PRIVATE/PUBLIC JOINT VENTURE, WHICH, OBLIGED IN THE 
PAST TO OPERATE AT THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE, HAS 
NOT ALWAYS OFFERED COMPETITIVE PRICES FOR EXPORT 
QUALITY FRUIT.  NOW FREE TO OPERATE AT THE PARALLEL 
MARKET RATE OF EXCHANGE, IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER 
COMPETITIVE PRICES IN THE FUTURE. 
- 
22. STATE ENTERPRISE PRICES:  THE PRICE DECONTROL 
INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 1985 HAS LEFT ALL PUBLIC 
ENTERPRISES WITH FULL FREEDOM TO SET INPUT AND 
OUTPUT PRICES AT LEVELS THAT WILL FULLY COVER 
COSTS.  MANY, HOWEVER, ENJOY MONOPOLY POSITIONS IN 
THE ECONOMY, AND HAVE NOT BEEN FORCED BY COMPETITIVE 
PRESSURES OR PRICE DEVELOPMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THE 
ECONOMY TO MOVE THEIR PRICES TO ECONOMIC LEVELS.  IN 
THIS CLASS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MONOPOLIES ARE THE 
COMMERCIAL AND SAVINGS BANK; THE STATE INSURANCE 
COMPANY OF SOMALIA; THE NATIONAL PETROLEUM AGENCY, 
WHICH CONTROLS OIL IMPORTS; THE SOMALI COOPERATIVE 
MOVEMENT,WHICH CONTROLS IN-COUNTRY OIL DISTRIBUTION 
AND, THROUGH THE FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH AGENCY, EX- 
PORTS OF AROMATIC GUMS; THE SOMALI LEATHER AGENCY, 
WHICH CONTROLS EXPORTS OF HIDES AND SKINS, ASPIMA, 
WHICH CONTROLS IMPORTS OF VETERINARY DRUGS; 
SOMALFRUTTA, WHICH CONTROLS EXPORTS OF BANANAS; 
THE SOMALI SHIPPING AGENCY, AND THE SOMALI CLEARING 
AND FORWARDING AGENCIES. 
- 
23. SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT POLICIES:  THE PUBLIC 
ENTERPRISES:  THERE ARE NOW 51 PARASTATAL CORPORATIONS 
OPERATING IN SOMALIA, INCLUDING FIVE FINANCIAL, 33 
NON-FINANCIAL AND EIGHT NON-COMMERCIAL PUBLIC ENTER- 
PRISES, WHICH TOGETHER DOMINATE MOST BANKING, 
INSURANCE, AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES IN SOMALIA. 
DURING THE 1970\'S THESE ENTERPRISES WERE NOT TREATED 
PRIMARILY AS PROFIT-MAKING COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, 
BUT OFTEN AS SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT AND INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PURSUIT OF SOCIAL 
WELFARE POLICIES.  SURPLUSES WERE TAXED AWAY BY HIGH 
PROFIT TAXES AND GOVERNMENT CLAIMS ON DEPRECIATION 
ALLOWANCES; WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT WERE DISTORTED BY 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES, AND PRICES FOR BOTH INPUTS 
AND OUTPUTS MAINTAINED AT UNREALISTICALLY LOW LEVELS. 
BEGINNING IN 1981, SOMALIA HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS TO 
ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.  THREE PUBLIC ENTERPRISES 
HAVE BEEN CLOSED; OTHERS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH 
FOREIGN MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE.  THE REST ARE BEING 
REVIEWED TO DETERMINE WHICH TO RETAIN AS SERVICE 
INSTITUTIONS ON PUBLIC SUBSIDIES, WHICH TO DIVEST 
OR CLOSE, AND WHICH TO ESTABLISH AS COMMERCIAL 
ENTERPRISES IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS.  DECISIONS HAVE 
ALSO BEEN TAKEN TO GRANT ALL PUBLIC ENTERPRISES 
AUTONOMY IN REGARD TO WAGE, EMPLOYMENT AND PRICING 
DECISIONS, AND WHERE POSSIBLE, TO ELIMINATE THE 
REMAINING PUBLIC SECTOR MONOPOLIES IN TRADE, BANKING 
AND SERVICES.  PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THESE DECISIONS, 
HOWEVER HAS BEEN SLOW. 
- 
24. PRIVATE INVESTMENT:  INCENTIVES:  SOMALIA\'S 
CURRENT INVESTMENT LAW OFFERS NEW INVESTMENTS TAX 
HOLIDAYS ON ALL INCOME, IMPORT, EXCISE AND PROPERTY 
TAXES FOR PERIODS OF UP TO FIVE YEARS.  IT ALSO 
GUARANTEES REMITTANCES AT THE RATES OUTLINED ABOVE. 
IN ADDITION, J  FHE NEW FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET 
ARRANGEMENTS, FACILITIES FOR REMITTANCES ABOVE THE 
RATES DEFINED IN THE LAW ARE AVAILABLE IN THE NEW 
LEGAL PARALLEL MARKET.  SOMALIA HAS NEGOTIATED A 
BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY WITH THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC 
OF GERMANY, WHICH PROVIDES FOR MOST FAVORED NATION 
OR NATIONAL TREATMENT FOR GERMAN INVESTORS, PROMPT 
AND ADEQUATE COMPENSATION IN CASE OF EXPROPRIATION, 
AND FREE TRANSFER OF CAPITAL, DIVIDENDS, INTEREST 
AND EARNINGS.  IT ALSO HAS UNDER CONSIDERATION TWO 
DRAFT BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES WITH THE UNITED 
STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN. 
- 
25. DISINCENTIVES:  DISINCENTIVES TO PRIVATE INVEST- 
MENT INCLUDE THE COUNTRY\'S GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURAL AND 
INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESSES, THE CONTINUING THREAT OF 
POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, THE PRE-EMPTION 
OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
MONOPOLIES, A CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY REGARDING 
MARKET FREEDOMS, THE CONTINUING RESTRICTIONS ON 
WAGE AND CAPITAL REMITTANCES, THE LACK OF A WELL 
DEFINED BODY OF COMPANY AND COMMERCIAL LAW, AND AN 
ONEROUS (THOUGH UNENFORCED) LABOR CODE WHICH OFFICIALLY 
DEPRIVES THE EMPLOYER OF THE RIGHT TO HIRE AND FIRE 
FREELY, MANDATES AN UNECONOMICALLY HIGH LEVEL OF WORKER 
BENEFITS, AND RESTRICTS THE EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN 
NATIONALS.  A REVIEW OF INVESTMENT LAW NOW UNDER WAY 
MAY ELIMINATE SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS NOW IMPOSED 
ON REMITTANCES, AND PROVIDE A FULLER SET OF PROPERTY 
RIGHTS FOR NEW INVESTORS. 
- 
26. LEVELS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT:  THERE 
HAVE BEEN WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN PRIVATE SECTOR 
SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT OVER THE PAST 13 YEARS, AS 
WEATHER INDUCED FLUCTUATIONS IN INVENTORY ACCUMULATION 
IN THE ALL-IMPORTANT LIVESTOCK SECTOR OVERWHELMED 
RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF PRIVATE SECTOR FIXED CAPITAL 
FORMATION.  PUBLIC SECTOR SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT HAVE 
ALSO VARIED WIDELY AS WARS, DROUGHTS AND REFUGEE 
CRISES HAVE REPEATEDLY SWELLED RECURRENT EXPENDITURES. 
OVERALL, DOMESTIC INVESTMENT TOTALLED APPROXIMATELY 
18 PERCENT OF GDP (10 PERCENT PUBLIC, 8 PERCENT PRIVATE) 
BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980, RISING TO 21 PERCENT (10 PERCENT 
PUBLIC, 11 PERCENT PRIVATE) BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983. 
SAVINGS LAGGED, TOTALLING ONLY 3 PERCENT OF GDP (MINUS 
7 PERCENT PUBLIC, 10 PERCENT PRIVATE) IN 1972 TO 1980, 
AND 4 PERCENT OF GDP (MINUS 10 PERCENT PUBLIC, 14 
PERCENT PRIVATE) BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983.  THE BALANCE 
OF INVESTMENT EXPENDITURES WERE COVERED BY FOREIGN 
GRANTS AND LOANS, AND REMITTANCES, WHICH TOGETHER 
AVERAGED 15 PERCENT OF GDP BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980, 
AND 18 PERCENT OF GDP BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983.  FOR 1984 
TO 1986, SOMALIA HAS PROPOSED A PUBLIC INVESTMENT 
PROGRAM WHICH WOULD RAISE NATIONAL INVESTMENT TO 23 
PERCENT OF GDP (16 PERCENT PUBLIC AND 7 PERCENT 
PRIVATE) FINANCED ENTIRELY BY FOREIGN GRANTS AND LOANS 
(25.5 PERCENT OF GDP).  WITH FOREIGN FINANCING AND 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR\'S OWN ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY SETTING 
LIMITS TO PUBLIC SECTOR ACTIVITIES, HOWEVER, ACTUAL 
PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT TOTALLED ONLY ABOUT 9 PERCENT 
OF GDP IN 1984 - A RATE THAT LIKELY WILL HOLD FOR THE 
NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS.

28. AID ASSISTANCE:  DISBURSEMENTS OF GRANTS AND 
LOANS TO SOMALIA FROM ALL OFFICIAL SOURCES FOR 
ALL USES (REFUGEE, DEVELOPMENT AND BALANCE OF 
PAYMENTS ASSISTANCE) HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY OVER 
THE PAST NINE YEARS, RISING FROM SLIGHTLY OVER 
US DOLS 120 MILLION IN 1975 TO APPROXIMATELY US 
DOLS 300 MILLION IN 1983, BEFORE DROPPING OFF 
SLIGHTLY IN 1984 TO APPROXIMATELY US DOLS 260 
MILLION.  GRANTS ACCOUNTED FOR A GRADUALLY IN- 
CREASING PROPORTION OF THIS ASSISTANCE (ABOVE 50 
PERCENT IN 1984), AND LOANS, INCLUDING LOANS 
FROM THE IMF AND ARAB MONETARY FUND, FOR THE 
BALANCE.  MAJOR DONORS AND LENDERS INCLUDED SAUDI 
ARABIA, KUWAIT, THE UNITED STATES, ITALY, THE 
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY, THE EEC, THE IBRD, 
THE IMF, THE ARAB FUND FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND 
THE ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK.  FOR 1985 AND 1986, 
SOMALIA HAS PROJECTED FURTHER GRANT AND LOAN DIS- 
BURSEMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY US DOLS 900 MILLION, 
THOUGH ACTUAL DISBURSEMENTS MAY FALL SOMEWHAT 
SHORT OF THIS TARGET. 
- 
29. PARALLELING THE RAPID INCREASE IN AID DIS- 
BURSEMENTS HAS BEEN AN EQUALLY RAPID RISE IN SOMALIA\'S 
EXTERNAL DEBT.  BETWEEN YEAR END 1979 AND YEAR END 
1984, SOMALIA\'S TOTAL EXTERNAL DEBT ROSE TO APPROX- 
IMATELY US DOLS 1445 MILLION, UP US DOLS 848 MILLION 
FROM THE US DOLS 597 MILLION LEVEL WHICH HAD PRE- 
VAILED AT THE CLOSE OF 1979.  THANKS TO EXTENSIVE 
REFINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, (WITH MIDDLE EASTERN 
CREDITORS, IN PARTICULAR), OVERALL DEBT SERVICE 
PAYMENTS HAVE REMAINED MANAGEABLE (50 PERCENT OF 
GOODS AND SERVICE EXPORTS IN 1984).  WITHOUT 
FURTHER RESCHEDULINGS, HOWEVER, DEBT SERVICE PAY- 
MENTS WILL RISE TO, AND MAY EXCEED, THE TOTAL OF 
SOMALIA\'S GOODS AND SERVICE EXPORTS OVER THE NEXT 
THREE YEARS. 
- 
30. SOURCES:  THE PRIMARY SOURCES USED IN COMPILING 
THIS REPORT WERE THE WORLD BANK\'S PRELIMINARY 
ESTIMATES OF NATIONAL ACCOUNT AGGREGATES PUBLISHED 
IN AUGUST 1984, THE IMF\'S REVIEW OF SOMALIA\'S STAND- 
BY ARRANGEMENT PUBLISHED IN APRIL 1984, THE IMF\'S 
DRAFT FINANCIAL PROGRAM FOR SOMALIA\'S PROPOSED 
1985 STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN 
NOVEMBER 1984, AND THE IMF\'S GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL 
STATISTICS YEARBOOK FOR 1983, INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL 
STATISTICS YEARBOOK FOR 1984, AND REPORT ON EX- 
CHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS FOR 
1984.  THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT 
FISCAL DATA FOR 1983 AND 1984 ARE PRELIMINARY.  THE 
MONETARY DATA IS RELIABLE THROUGH THE CLOSE OF 1983. 
THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS DATA ARE RELIABLE THROUGH THE 
CLOSE OF 1982.

2.  RUMORS ARE PROBABLY ALWAYS ABUNDANT HERE BUT AN FSN 
EMPLOYEE (PROTECT SOURCE) TELLS US THAT RUMORS OF A NEW 
KIND ARE CIRCULATING, AS FOLLOWS: 
 
--FAILURE TO ANNOUNCE A DATE FOR THE INAUGURAL MEETING OF 
THE NEW PARLIAMENT REFLECTS SIAD BARRE\'S INDECISION ABOUT 
POSSIBLE MAJOR CHANGES; 
 
--THE PRESIDENT MAY ABSENT HIMSELF FROM THE COUNTRY FOR 
EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS ON GROUNDS OF HEALTH, DECIDING ONLY 
AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD WHETHER TO RETURN; 
 
--HE MAY RE-CREATE THE POST OF PRIME MINISTER AND MAKE 
SAMANTAR, NOW FIRST VICE PRESIDENT AND DEFENSE MINISTER, 
PRIME MINISTER TO RUN THE COUNTRY IN HIS ABSENCE; 
 
--GENERAL GANNI, THE HARSH MILITARY COMMANDER IN THE 
NORTH, MIGHT REPLACE SAMANTAR AS DEFENSE MINISTER; 
 
--SECOND VICE PRESIDENT KULMIE MIGHT BE GIVEN THE 
HONORIFIC POST OF CHAIRMAN OF PARLIAMENT. 
 
3.  COMMENT:  THESE RUMORS ARE NOT OUT OF LINE WITH OTHER 
INFORMATION THE EMBASSY (INCLUDING SIRO) HAS REPORTED, 
WHICH INDICATE THAT SIAD BARRE IS FEELING MORE AGED AND 
WORRIED AND THAT THE QUESTION OF HIS LEAVING THE COUNTRY 
HAS INDEED COME UP, ALTHOUGH HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID 
THAT HE WILL NOT LEAVE.  THE DEPARTMENT WILL RECALL THAT 
MINISTER OF THE PRESIDENCT ADDOU CONFIRMED TO THE 
AMBASSADOR A FEW DAYS AGO THAT A CABINET SHAKEUP WAS 
COMING AND MIGHT INVOLVE THE TWO VICE PRESIDENTS. 
WHETHER THE INAUGURAL MEETING OF PARLIAMENT IS ACTUALLY 
BEING DELAYED IS NOT CLEAR; WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT 
IT MAY BE HELD THIS COMING WEEK.

1. (SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
- 
2. THE FOLLOWING IS IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS 
POSED IN PARAGRAPH FIVE OF REFTEL. 
 
- 
3. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO LIBYAN PRESENCE IN SOMALIA. 
 
- 
4. SOMALIA HAS NO OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH LIBYA. 
THE GSDR VIEWS QADHAFI AS AN ENEMY BECAUSE HE 
SUPPORTS THE SOMALI DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS TRYING 
TO BRING DOWN THE SOMALI GOVERNMENT.   THERE HAVE 
BEEN RUMORS RECENTLY OF TENTATIVE CONTACTS BETWEEN 
SOMALIA AND LIBYA ABOUT RESTORING RELATIONS. 
ITALIANS HAVE TOLD US THAT DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDER 
WAY ABOUT PLACING A SOMALI DIPLOMAT IN THE ITALIAN 
EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI AND A LIBYAN DIPLOMAT IN THE 
YUGOSLAV EMBASSY IN MOGADISHU.  IT SEEMS LIKELY, 
IF TRUE, THAT PRESIDENT SIAD WILL TRY TO USE THE 
LIBYANS\' DESIRE FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS AS A LEVER 
TO PERSUADE THEM TO STOP SUPPORTING THE DISSIDENTS. 
 
- 
5. OVERT OPPOSITION TO THE SIAD REGIME IS CENTERED 
ON TWO DISSIDENT GROUPS, THE SOMALI NATIONAL 
MOVEMENT (SNM) AND THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC SALVATION 
FRONT (SDSF), WHICH ARE HEADQUARTERED IN ADDIS 
ABABA AND OPERATE AGAINST SOMALIA OUT OF ETHIOPIA. 
WE UNDERSTAND LIBYA HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THESE GROUPS 
FOR SEVERAL YEARS. 
 
- 
6. LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR THE DISSIDENTS HAS BEEN 
CONSTRAINED ON OCCASION BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENTS\' 
RELUCTANCE TO MERGE AS QADHAFI DESIRES OR TO FOLLOW 
A MORE RADICAL IDEOLOGICAL LINE. 
 
- 
7. AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE GSDR IS UNLIKELY TO 
SUPPORT LIBYAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ANYWHERE IN 
AFRICA EXCEPT AGAINST ETHIOPIA.  OVER THE PAST 
YEAR, SOMALIA PUBLICLY HAS CRITICIZED LIBYAN 
ACTIVITIES IN CHAD AND ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA, AS WELL 
AS LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR THE SNM AND THE SDSF. 
HOWEVER, SOMALIA DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO 
ASSIST ANY COUNTRY THREATENED BY THE LIBYANS. 
 
- 
8. THE FACT THAT SOMALIA AND LIBYA ARE BOTH ISLAMIC 
COUNTRIES IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THEIR 
RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER. 
 
- 
9. ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN SOMALIA AND LIBYA IS 
POSSIBLE IF LIBYAN FORCES WERE TO BE SENT TO 
ETHIOPIA AND TOOK UP POSITIONS ALONG THE BORDER 
WITH SOMALIA.  WE BELIEVE THAT FULL-SCALE WAR 
BETWEEN SOMALIA AND ETHIOPIA IS UNLIKELY.  CROSS 
BORDER SKIRMISHES, HOWEVER, ARE RECURRENT AND 
POSSIBLE LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, 
ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD MEAN ADDING A NEW ELEMENT 
TO THE CURRENT SOVIET/CUBAN MILITARY INVOLVEMENT 
IN ETHIOPIA.

THAT HE HAD RESPONDED THAT THE SOVIETS WERE READY 
BUT SEVERAL THINGS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE. THE 
SOMALIS WOULD HAVE TO TREAT HIM PRDPERLY AS AN 
AMBASSADOR; THEY WOULD HAVE TD STOP THEIR ANTI- 
SOVIET COMPAIGN; THEY WOULD HAVE TD CALL OFF THE

IN PARLIAMENT, SIAD BARRE MADE A PUBLIC 
STATEMENT LAST WEEK (MOGADISHU 1520) OF HIS READINESS 
TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW; MOREOVER, 
AS WE NOTED, THIS WAS NOT A NEW DEPARTURE IN SIAD\'S 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS. WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT MOTIVE 
SIAD BARRE MIGHT HAVE FOR MAKING A PRIVATE 
APPROACH TO THE SOVIETS ON NORMALIZATION. MY 
ARAB SOURCE SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS TO 
GOAD US INTO PROVIDING MORE ASSISTANCE, SINCE 
SIAD WOULD ASSUME THAT WE WOULD BECOME AWARE OF 
THE APPROACH. BUT I THINK IT IS ALSO CONCEIVABLE 
THAT EVEN IF SIAD SEES NO POSSIBILITY OF RECEIVING 
FUTURE MILITARY OR DEVELOPMENT AID FROM THE SOVIETS, 
HE MIGHT THINK IT POSSIBLE TO GET THE SOVIETS TO

HIS BORDERS.

2.  THIS MORNING AT THE CEREMONY INITIATING THE AID 
PROJECT FOR PVOS, I TOOK THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR, 
AHMED SULEIMAN ABDALLAH, ASIDE.  I RECALLED THAT 
WHEN FOREIGN MINISTER JAMA BARRE HAD MET WITH THE 
SECRETARY AT THE UNGA LAST FALL, JAMA BARRE HAD TOLD 
MR. SHULTZ THAT THE LIBYANS HAD WANTED TO BRING A 
STAFF OF 75 PEOPLE TO SOMALIA BUT THEY HAD BEEN TOLD 
THEY COULD BRING ONLY FIVE.  I WAS INFORMED THAT THE 
FIVE HAD NOW BECOME 12, PLUS A COUPLE OF LIBYANS 
AT THE LIBSOMA AGRICULTURAL PROJECT.  AS TO WHAT 
THEY WERE DOING, IT WAS CLEAR. 
WHEN I HAD LEFT MY EMBASSY TO COME TO THE CEREMONY, 
A CAR WITH LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC TAGS HAD BEEN PARKED 
100 YARDS AWAY.  THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY WATCHING US. 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE PRESENT DOZEN BECAME 50, OR 
60? 
 
 
3.  AHMED SULEIMAN ACTED AS IF HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE 
OF WHAT JAMA BARRE HAD TOLD THE SECRETARY.  (INCI- 
DENTALLY, AHMED SULEIMAN DISLIKES JAMA BARRE, AND 
THIS WAS ALSO IN MY MIND.)  THE MINISTER SAID THAT 
HE WOULD TAKE A NEW LOOK AT THE SITUATION, AND HE 
THANKS ME FOR MENTIONING THIS TO HIM.  HE  DID  THINK 
THAT THE SOMALI SECURITY FORCES WERE COOPERATING 
CLOSELY WITH US.  I SAID THAT INDEED THEY WERE, BUT 
THE MORE LIBYANS THERE WERE, THE HARDER IT WOULD BE 
TO WATCH THEM.  I COULD REMEMBER FROM YEARS BACK 
THE DIFFICULTIES THAT OUR OWN PEOPLE HAD IN THE 
UNITED STATES, WHEN SOVIET STAFFS IN WASHINGTON AND 
NEW YORK BAGAN TO RISE.

THE LIBYAN EMBASSY AROUND THE CITY OF MOGADISHU WHICH 
SEEK RECRUITS FOR AN \"ALL-ARAB ARMY\".  THE \"ARMY\" IS 
AIMED AT FIGHTING \"IMPERIALISM AND ZIONISM\" AND ON

GULF FROM FOREIGN DOMINATION.  THE FLIERS TELL 
PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS TO GO TO THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S

\"AS LIBYANS\".  SIMILAR FLIERS ARE REPORTEDLY BEING 
PASSED AROUND BY THE IRAQI EMBASSY, AS WELL.  THE LIBYAN 
FLIER IDENTIFIES AS PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES THOSE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SOME TECHNICAL OR MILITARY TRAINING.

3.  THERE HAVE BEEN LARGE CROWDS OUTSIDE THE LIBYAN

FLIERS.  ON BOTH MARCH 12 AND 13 POLICE DISPERSED 
THE CROWDS, AND ON THE MORNING OF MARCH 13, THE

REMAINED HANGING AROUND THE LIBYAN MISSION.

GETTING ENOUGH RECRUITS TO MAN THEIR OWN ARMY, 
AND HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SEND PRESS GANGS PERI-

ASKANCE AT SOMALIS RESPONDING FAVORABLY TO A FOR-

OR THE IRAQIS TO COMPLAIN OF THESE RECRUITMENT

2.  LIBYAN TERRORISM:  EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR MEKKY 
(PROTECT SOURCE) TOLD ME MARCH 24 THAT HE UNDERSTOOD 
THAT THE RECENT LIBYAN PUBLIC RECRUITMENT DRIVE 
(MOGADISHU 3124) HAD RESULTED IN THE SUCCESSFUL 
RECRUITMENT OF ABOUT 40 SOMALIS, WHO LEFT MOGADISHU 
SUPPOSEDLY FOR DESTINATIONS IN THE GULF BUT ACTUALLY 
TO GO ON TO LIBYA FOR TRAINING.  MEKKY\'S UNDERSTANDING 
WAS THAT QADHAFI WAS INTENDING TO PUT THESE AND 
OTHER FOREIGN RECRUITS INTO A KIND OF SUICIDE BATTA- 
LION TO BE TARGETTED AGAINST AMERICANS IN THE EVENT 
OF HOSTILITIES IN THE GULF OF SIDRA.  (NOTE:  WE WOULD 
APPRECITE RECEIVING ANY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE 
LIBYAN IDEA BEHIND THE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, WHICH WE 
GATHER WERE UNDERTAKEN BY THE LIBYANS AS FAR AFIELD 
AS AUSTRALIA.)   MEKKY ADDED THAT EGYPTIAN INFORMATION 
WAS THAT OF THE 12 PRESENT MEMBERS OF THE LIBYAN 
PEOPLE\'S BUREAU HERE, EIGHT WERE TERRORISTS.  HIS 
FEELING WAS THAT THE LIBYANS MIGHT NOT INTEND ANY 
EARLY TERRORIST ACTION IN MOGADISHU, AND HE HOPED 
THAT THEY MIGHT BE DISSUADED FROM ACTION AGAINST HIS 
EMBASSY BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED THE CHILDREN 
OF THE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO LIBYANS IN THE 
EGYPTIAN SCHOOL, PLUS THE FACT THAT A COUPLE OF THE 
LIBYANS HAD BEEN EDUCATED IN EGYPT.  HOWEVER, HE 
CONTINUED, LIBYAN OFFICIALS WOULD PRESUMABLY CARRY OUT 
ORDERS, NO MATTER WHERE THEY HAD BEEN EDUCATED. 
HE SAID THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE ANY ATTACK ON HIS 
PEOPLE HERE, HE HAD ORDERED THAT THE LIBYAN CHILDREN 
BE BROUGHT FOR \"SAFEKEEPING\" DIRECT FROM THE EGYPTIAN 
SCHOOL TO THE EGYPTIAN CHANCERY. 
- 
3.  IRANIAN TERRORISM:  MEKKY SHARED WITH ME A CAIRO 
REPORT THAT NORTH KOREAN INSTRUCTORS HAD BEEN CONDUCTING 
TERRORIST TRAINING AT A MILITARY INSTALLATION IN IRAN, 
AND THAT 40 SUCH IRANIAN TRAINEES, OF WHOM 11 WERE 
WOMEN, HAD LEFT TEHERAN EARLY ON THE MORNING OF 
JANUARY 15 BY MILITARY AIRCRAFT FOR AN UNKNOWN DESTINA- 
TION.  THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY HAD SHARED THIS INFORMA- 
TION WITH SOMALI SECURITY OFFICIALS ON MARCH 8; THERE 
WAS NO INDICATION THAT ANY OF THE IRANIANS HAD COME 
TO SOMALIA. 
 
4.  COMMENT:  RE PARA 2, THE SOMALI AUTHORITIES DID 
THEIR UTMOST TO COUNTER THE LIBYAN RECRUITMENT EFFORTS 
AND WE ARE SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL AS MANY AS 40 RECRUITED 
SOMALIS HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY.  NOR HAVE WE BEEN ABLE 
TO CONFIRM THAT AS MANY AS 8 OF THE 12 LIBYAN 
\"DIPLOMATS\" HERE ARE TERRORISTS.

BUREAU THAT THE SOMALI GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT COUNTENANCE 
ANY RETALIATION AGAINST U.S. PERSONNEL OR FACILITIES IN 
SOMALIA.  THE LIBYANS WERE ASKED TO GIVE THEIR 
ASSURANCE THAT NO HOSTILE ACTION WILL BE TAKEN AGAINST 
THE U.S. AND TO CONVEY THIS REQUEST TO TRIPOLI.  ADAN 
SAID THAT THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAU HAD NOW PROVIDED 
THESE ASSURANCES TO THE MFA. 
 
3.  BRIDGES ASKED ADAN TO CONVEY TO PRESIDENT SIAD OUR 
DISAPPOINTMENT OVER THE ARAB LEAGUE RESOLUTION, BUT 
ALSO HIS APPRECIATION FOR THE SOMALI DECISION NOT TO 
ISSUE A SEPARATE STATEMENT AND FOR THE MFA DEMARCHE 
TO THE LIBYANS REGARDING RETALIATION.  WE APPRECIATED 
THE EXCELLENT COOPERATION OF THE SOMALI SECURITY 
AUTHORITIES IN KEEPING CLOSE WATCH ON LIBYAN PERSONNEL 
IN SOMALIA.  BRIDGES SAID HE BELIEVED THAT WE AND 
THE SOMALI AUTHORITIES FULLY AGREED THAT QADHAFI COULD 
NOT BE TRUSTED.  WE WOULD THEREFORE LOOK TO CONTINUED 
CLOSE COOPERATION WITH SOMALI OFFICIALS ON THIS 
PROBLEM. 
 
4.  ADAN SUGGESTED THAT SOME COUNTRIES WERE TENDING 
TO LOOK AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE GULF OF SIDRA AS A 
CASE OF A POWERFUL COUNTRY TAKING A FORCEFUL STANCE 
AGAINST A SMALLER AND WEAKER ONE.  BRIDGES SAID THAT 
WHILE UNDOUBTEDLY THE UNITED STATES WAS LARGER 
AND MORE POWERFUL THAN LIBYA, OUR ACTION WAS MOTIVATED 
BY OUR STRONG INTEREST IN MAINTAINING THE FREEDOM 
OF THE SEAS IN THE FACE OF ANY COUNTRY\'S ILLEGAL 
CLAIMS, LARGE OR SMALL.  BRIDGES REMINDED ADAN THAT WE 
HAD REACTED ONLY AFTER THE LIBYANS HAD FIRED SIX 
MISSILES AT OUR FORCES IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS OVER 
A PERIOD OF SEVERAL HOURS.  WHILE THE GULF OF SIDRA 
EXERCISES HAD ENDED, WE WERE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT 
LIBYA MIGHT SEEK TO ATTACK OUR PEOPLE OR FACILITIES 
ELSEWHERE.  THE PROBLEM WAS COMPLICATED BY THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT THE LIBYANS WOULD EMPLOY OTHERS, 
INCLUDING CONCEIVABLY SOMALIS, TO DO THEIR DIRTY WORK. 
AGAIN, WE WERE ANXIOUS TO STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH 
THE SOMALI AUTHORITIES ON THIS. 
 
5.  AT THE END OF THE MEETING ADAN NOTED THAT HE 
WOULD BE GOING TO DJIBOUTI FROM APRIL 2 THROUGH 6 TO 
ATTEND THE NEXT IGAAD (EAST AFRICA DROUGHT) MEETING, 
WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS ROUTINE.

SUBJECT:  SOMALI WARNING TO LIBYANS ON TERRORISM 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  WE REPORTED EARLIER THAT THE SOMALIS HAD INFORMED 
US THAT THEY HAD WARNED THE HEAD OF THE LIBYAN 
PEOPLE\'S BUREAU AGAINST UNDERTAKING ANY ACTION AGAINST 
AMERICANS IN SOMALIA.  I HAVE JUST HAD ADDITIONAL 
CONFIRMATION OF THIS FROM EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR MEKKY 
(PROTECT SOURCE), WHO SAYS THAT MFA MINISTER OF STATE 
HAMOUD TOLD HIM TWO DAYS BEFORE HAMOUD\'S CURRENT TRIP 
TO THE NEW DELHI NAM MEETING THAT HE, HAMOUD, HAD 
CALLED IN THE HEAD OF THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAU. 
- 
3.  HAMOUD TOLD MEKKY THAT HE HAD TOLD THE LIBYAN 
THAT THE SOMALIS DID NOT LIKE THE CHARGES BEING 
EXCHANGED BETWEEN TRIPOLI AND WASHINGTON.  THE LIBYANS 
SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT IT HAD TAKEN THE SOMALI 
GOVERNMENT A LONG TIME TO AGREE TO RESUME RELATIONS 
WITH LIBYA.  IN THIS CONNECTION, HAMOUD SAID HE WANTED 
TO WARN THE LIBYANS AGAINST ANY ACTION AGAINST 
AMERICANS OR AMERICAN PROPERTY.  IN REPLY, THE LIBYAN 
ASSURED HAMOUD THAT NO SUCH ACTION WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN 
AS LONG AS HE REMAINED HEAD OF THE PEOPLE\'S BUREAU. 
 
4.  I THANKED AMBASSADOR MEKKY FOR THIS INFORMATION, 
WHICH I SAID CORRESPONDED WITH WHAT THE SOMALIS HAD 
TOLD US.  I ADDED THAT (A) LIBYAN PROMISES WERE OF 
COURSE WORTH NOTHING, AND (B) ANY ACTION AGAINST US 
HERE WOULD PRESUMABLY NOT BE TAKEN BY THE LIBYANS 
IN PERSON, AS THE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD IN FACT JUST 
WARNED ME (MOGADISHU 4319).

REF:  (A) STATE 214518, (B) MOGADISHU 7910 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MEETING JULY 3 WITH ACTING 
PERMSEC ABDULLAHI EGAL NUR TO PROBE A BIT 
REGARDING GSDR\'S CURRENT POSITION ON ETHIOPIAN ROLE IN 
NORTHERN INSURGENCY.  I HOPED IN PARTICULAR TO OBTAIN 
INSIGHT INTO AMBASSADOR ADDOU\'S DEMARCHE \"UNDER 
INSTRUCTIONS\" (REF A), IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO TAKE A 
MUCH MORE FORCEFULLY CRITICAL LINE ON  ETHIOPIANS 
THAN HAD PRESIDENT SIAD HIMSELF IN OUR CONVERSATION 
JULY 1 (REF B). 
 
3.  CHOOSING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY, AMB ABDULLAHI TOLD 
ME SOMALIA DID NOT CONSIDER ETHIOPIANS \"CLEAN-HANDED\", 
BUT IT LACKED HARD EVIDENCE OF ANY SORT TO SUBSTANTIATE 
ETHIOPIAN COMPLICITY.  SOMALI GOVERNMENT WAS DEEPLY 
DISTURBED BY THE FACT THAT SNM FORCES HAD NOT/NOT BEEN 
DISARMED BEFORE BEING EXPELLED ACROSS BORDER.  IT WAS 
NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER THIS WAS A DELIBERATE 
OVERSIGHT OR MERELY INADVERTENCY. 
 
4.  AMB ABDULLAHI THEN POINTED TO \"GROSS EXAGGERATION\" 
BY ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES OF NUMBERS OF SOMALI 
REFUGEES THAT HAD REPORTEDLY FLED ACROSS BORDER TO ESCAPE 
FIGHTING IN NORTHERN REGION.  ALTHOUGH ETHIOPIANS CLAMED 
TO HAVE RECEIVED OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND REFUGEES, 
SOMALI GOVERNMENT WAS \"CERTAIN\" THAT FIGURE WAS NO 
HIGHER THAN THIRTY THOUSAND.  I SUGGESTED TO ABDULLAHI 
THAT THIS HAD LITTLE BEARING ON QUESTION OF ETHIOPIAN 
COMPLICITY WITH SNM, BUT HE CONTENDED THAT IT IMPLIED 
AN ANTAGONISTIC BIAS ON ETHIOPIA\'S PART. 
 
5.  I ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT EVIDENCE THAT ETHIOPIA 
HAD HELPED RESUPPLY SNM AFTER ATTACKS BEGAN.  HE REPLIED 
THERE WAS NO/NO HARD EVIDENCE, ONLY \"CIRCUMSTANTIAL\" 
INDICATIONS. 
 
6.  AS I LEFT THE MEETING WITH ABDULLAHI, ESCORTED 
BY PROTOCOL CHIEF ABDI HAJI, I REGISTERED MILD SURPRISE 
TO THE LATTER THAT ABDULLAHI HAD NOT/NOT MENTIONED 
INSTRUCTIONS TO AMB ADDOU (REF A) TO RAISE THIS ISSUE 
WITH A/S CROCKER.  ABDI RESPONDED THAT HE WAS UNAWARE THA 
ANY SUCH INSTRUCTIONS HAD BEEN SENT TO WASHINGTON FROM 
MINISTRY.  HOWEVER, HE CONFIDED THAT ADDOU HAD TELEPHONED 
PRESIDENT SIAD DIRECTLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS RECENTLY, 
IMPLYING THAT INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN CONVEYED 
TO ADDOU DIRECTLY BY PRESIDENT. 
 
7.  ABDI HAJI ALSO VOLUNTEERED HIS SUGGESTION THAT 
CROCKER SHOULD CLOSELY QUESTION SOVIET VICE MINISTER 
ADAMISHIN ABOUT ETHIOPIA\'S ROLE AND WHAT SOVIETS 
WERE PREPARED TO DO TO ENSURE ETHIOPIANS KEPT 
HANDS OFF.  HE EXPLAINED THAT, WHEN ADAMISHIN 
VISITED MOGADISHU IN APRIL, HE MADE A BIG FUSS ABOUT 
WHETHER SOMALIA COULD PERSUADE USG TO SERVE AS 
\"GUARANTOR\" OF SOMALI-ETHIOPIAN PEACE AGREEMENT. 
SOVIETS, HE DECLARED, WERE PREPARED TO SIGN ON 
ETHIOPIA\'S BEHALF. 
- 
8.  COMMENT:  JUDGING FROM WHAT I\'VE HEARD FROM 
PRESIDENT SIAD AND AMB ABDULLAHI, I SUSPECT OUR 
FRIEND ADDOU MAY HAVE PROMPTED THE PRESIDENT TO 
ISSUE THE INSTRUCTIONS HE THEN CARRIED TO A/S CROCKER. 
MORE AND MORE, IT APPEARS THAT PEOPLE AROUND SIAD 
ARE PUSHING HIM IN WHATEVER DIRECTION APPEARS TO 
SERVE THEIR OWN INTERESTS (OR THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF 
THE NATION\'S INTERESTS), WHILE SIAD HIMSELF IS 
BUFFETED BY THEIR CROSS PURPOSES.  I DO NOT/NOT BELIEVE 
WE ARE ANY CLOSER THAN BEFORE TO SEEING HARD EVIDENCE 
OF ETHIOPIAN COMPLICITY, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT -- 
WHETHER SIAD LIKES IT OR NOT -- THE BLUSH 
IS OFF OF HIS VAUNTED PEACE AGREEMENT WITH ETHIOPIA.

IS CLEARLY A SCENE-SETTER FOR CURRENT (AND LONG-

THAT ARRIVED HERE WITH MUCH HOOPLA LAST WEEKEND. 
IZVESTIYA CLAIMS THAT THERE IS WIDESPREAD 
ENTHUSIASM IN SOMALIA FOR A REVIVAL OF CLOSE

REF:  MOGADISHU 1691 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
- 
2.  SUMMARY:  SEVERAL SOMALI FRIENDS CONFIDED DISAPPOINT- 
MENT TO US OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT THE MAKEUP OF 
PRESIDENT SIAD\'S NEW GOVERNMENT.  THEY GENERALLY 
CONSIDERED THE LINEUP POLITICALLY WEAK (THOUGH 
TECHNICALLY STRONGER) AND OF LITTLE VALUE TO THE POLITICAL 
REFORM PROCESS.  I\'VE TOLD THEM THEY ARE TOO PESSIMISTIC, 
THAT I PERCEIVE A POLITICAL COMPROMISE NEUTRALIZING SOME 
IMPORTANT OPPONENTS OF REFORM AND LEAVING PRESIDENT SIAD 
FREE TO MOVE AHEAD -- IF HE WILL ONLY DO SO.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
- 
POLITICALLY WEAK CABINET 
------------------------ 
 
3.  ABDULKADIR ADAN ABDULLAH, SON OF SOMALIA\'S FIRST 
PRESIDENT AND SOMETIME POLITICAL PRISONER, SHOWED UP 
EARLY FOR OUR FAREWELL FUNCTION FOR DEPARTING ITALIAN 
AMBASSADOR FEBRUARY 17.  BEFORE OTHER GUESTS ARRIVED, 
ABDULKADIR COMMENTED THAT THE NEW LIST OF APPOINTMENTS 
LEFT PRESIDENT SIAD IN UNCHALLENGED CONTROL OF THE 
GOVERNMENT.  PRACTICALLY NONE OF THE NEW MINISTERS COULD 
CLAIM TO REPRESENT ANY POLITICAL OR TRIBAL FACTION, 
ABDULKADIR REMARKED.  ALL OF THEM WOULD BE VIEWED AS BEING 
ENTIRELY IN SIAD\'S POCKET. 
 
- 
4.  PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME TO ABDULKADIR WAS THE 
CHANGED SITUATION IN THE MILITARY AND AT THE DEFENSE 
MINISTRY, AS A RESULT OF GENERAL MORGAN\'S SHIFT TO THE 
PUBLIC WORKS MINISTRY.  THIS, SAID ABDULKADIR, LEFT THE 
PRESIDENT\'S SON GENERAL MASLAH IN UNCHALLENGED CONTROL 
OF THE ENTIRE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT (SINCE DEFMIN 
\"MATAN\" , A CIVILIAN, IS CONSIDERED INCONSEQUENTIAL). 
ABDULKADIR COMMENTED THAT MORGAN\'S PRESENCE IN THE DEFENSE 
MINISTRY HAD REPRESENTED SOME CONSTRAINT ON MASLAH, AND 
HE CLAIMED THAT TENSION HAD BEEN GROWING BETWEEN THE TWO. 
BUT MORGAN HAD, IN EFFECT, BEEN BOUGHT OFF BY BEING 
GIVEN THE LUCRATIVE PUBLIC WORKS PORTFOLIO IN EXCHANGE 
FOR SURRENDERING HIS MILITARY ROLE. 
 
- 
LITTLE IMPULSE TO REFORM 
------------------------ 
 
5.  ABDURRAHMAN OSMAN \"SHUKEH\" ALSO ARRIVED AT OUR 
LUNCHEON IN A MOOD IF DISAPPOINTMENT OVER THE CABINET 
ANNOUNCEMENT.  SHUKEH (WHO HAD HIMSELF DECLINED AN 
APPOINTMENT) WARNED THAT THIS CABINET WAS LIKELY TO DO 
LITTLE TO LEAD THE COUNTRY THROUGH CONSTITUTIONAL REVISIONS 
AND INTO MULTIPARTY ELECTIONS THIS YEAR.  HE SAID THE 
PRESIDENT HAD MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO GARNER SUPPORT FOR 
THE REFORM PROCESS WHICH HE COULD HAVE WON BY NAMING 
FIGURES TO THE NEW CABINET WHO COULD SPEAK FOR PARTICULAR 
INTEREST GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY.  INSTEAD, HE CHOSE TO 
NAME TECHNOCRATS AND PERSONS HE COULD EASILY MANIPULATE 
HIMSELF.  SHUKEH, WHO IS A FORMER MINISTER OF EDUCATION 
AND NOW SECRETARY OF THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, WAS NOT 
HOPEFUL THAT SIAD WOULD WIN MUCH CREDIBILITY AMONG 
SOMALIS WITH HIS NEW APPOINTMENTS NOR ACHIEVE THE POLITICAL 
CONSENSUS NEEDED FOR FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS. 
 
- 
A COMPROMISE BETWEEN RIVAL FAMILY GROUPS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6.  EARLIER IN THE DAY, NURTA HAJI HASSAN, A LAWYER AND 
DEPUTY STATE COUNSEL AT THE PRESIDENCY, DROPPED BY THE 
RESIDENCE TO CHAT WITH MY WIFE.  SHE WATCHED MUCH OF THE 
SELECTION PROCESS FROM THE INSIDE OF VILLA SOMALIA OVER 
THE PAST 40 DAYS AND DESCRIBED THE OUTCOME AS A PAINFUL 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN OLD GUARD SUPPORTERS OF PRIME MINISTER 
SAMANTAR (INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT\'S WIFE KHADIJA) AND 
MAREHAN-FIRST ELEMENTS OF THE FAMILY CONNECTED WITH FORMER 
FOREIGN MINISTER JAMA BARRE.  THE COMPROMISE CONSISTED 
ESSENTIALLY OF EXCLUDING OLD GUARD MEMBERS SULEIMAN 
ABDALLAH (EX-INTERIOR MINISTER), KULMIE AFRAH (EX-PUBLIC 
WORKS), AND MOHAMED SHEIKH OSMAN (EX-FINMIN) ON ONE SIDE; 
AND EXCLUDING JAMA BARRE HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHILE 
ADDING HIS PAL ABDULKADIR HAJI MQHAMED AS INTERIOR 
MINISTER. 
 
- 
7.  NURTA WAS NOT ENTIRELY NEGATIVE ABOUT THE RESULTS, 
AS SHE SAID IT MADE WAY FOR A NUMBER OF TECHNOCRATS AND 
CAPABLE YOUNGER MEN TO BE GIVEN PORTFOLIOS.  SOME OF THESE 
HAD PROVEN TO BE COMPETENT BUREAUCRATS AT THE DIRGEN OR 
EVEN VICE MINISTER LEVEL; OTHERS BROUGHT EXCELLENT 
CREDENTIALS FROM FOREIGN TRAINING TO THEIR JOBS. 
NEVERTHELESS, NURTA CONCEDED THAT THE CABINET WAS 
POLITICALLY A VERY WEAK ONE THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO 
SOLVE ANY OF THE COUNTRY\'S DEEPER PROBLEMS. 
 
- 
BETTER ON THE INSIDE THAN THE OUTSIDE 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.  THE WIFE OF ISAAK POLITBURO MEMBER AHMED MOHAMOUD 
FARAH TOLD MRS. CRIGLER THAT HER HUSBAND IS NOT EXACTLY 
PROUD TO BE APPOINTED TO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS WILL BE A 
PURELY CEREMONIAL POST AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER.  SHE 
SAID ISAAKS ARE NOT FOOLED BY HAVING ONE OF THEIR NUMBER 
ASSIGNED THE NUMBER TWO CABINET SLOT, BUT THEY CONSIDER 
IT USEFUL TO HAVE SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE KEEPING TRACK OF 
THINGS AND EXERCISING AT LEAST SOME MODERATING INFLUENCE 
ON THE PRESIDENT. 
 
- 
MAYBE OUR FRIENDS ARE TOO PESSIMISTIC 
------------------------------------- 
 
9.   SOMALIS LOVE TO LOOK ON THE DARK SIDE OF THINGS, AND 
THEY ESPECIALLY ENJOY READING NEGATIVE SIGNALS INTO 
WHATEVER THE PRESIDENT ATTEMPTS TO DO THESE DAYS.  I\'VE 
TRIED TO SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A BRIGHTER SIDE TO THE 
NEW CABINET LIST: SPECIFICALLY, THAT IT INDEED DOES 
REPRESENT A COMPROMISE -- PERHAPS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE -- 
BETWEEN THE TWO MOST POWERFUL COMPETING GROUPS AT VILLA 
SOMALIA.  PERHAPS IN THE PROCESS THEY HAVE NEUTRALIZED 
EACH OTHER, LEAVING THE WAY OPEN FOR PRESIDENT SIAD 
HIMSELF TO SEIZE THE INITIATIVE AND REGAIN SOME MEASURE 
OF PERSONAL LEADERSHIP.  IF HE IS TRULY SERIOUS ABOUT 
REFORMS AND RECONCILIATION, THIS MAY BE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE 
FORWARD DRAMATICALLY. 
 
- 
10.  THE REAL QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED: IS SIAD PREPARED 
TO SEIZE THE INITIATIVE AND BEGIN CAMPAIGNING SERIOUSLY FOR 
THE POLITICAL REFORMS THE COUNTRY NEEDS AND HE HAS 
PROMISED TO ACCEPT?  AND IF SO, IS HE PHYSICALLY AND 
MENTALLY CAPABLE OF EXERCISING THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP 
NEEDED TO ACHIEVE SUCH BASIC REFORMS?  UP TO NOW, HE HAS 
HAD TO BE DRAGGED KICKING AND SCREAMING BY OTHERS INTO 
THE REFORM PROCESS.  NOW THE WAY SEEMS OPEN, IF HE WILL 
TAKE ADVANTAGE, TO MOVE ON TO THE OFFENSIVE AND TAKE CHARGE 
OF THE REFORM PROCESS IN A POSITIVE SPIRIT.  UNLESS HE 
DOES SO, THERE WILL BE NO REFORMS -- AND SIAD HAS GOT TO 
RECOGNIZE THIS.  MY HOPE IS THAT OUR INTERLOCUTORS WILL 
FIND A WAY TO GET THIS MESSAGE BACK TO THE PRESIDENT AND 
PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY TO 
SALVAGE HIS FAMILY AND TRIBAL INTERESTS, HIS REPUTATION, 
AND HIS OWN SKIN.

2.  SUMMARY:  EXHAUSTED BY FRATRICIDE AND WEAKENED BY 
HUNGER,FEUDING TRIBES IN NORTHWEST SOMALIA MAY AT LAST 
BE READY TO MAKE PEACE AMONG THEMSELVES, WITH SNM, AND 
WITH GSDR.  SOMALI ARMY \"WARLORDS\" IN THE NORTH HAVE 
ALREADY WITHDRAWN FROM THE FRAY TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO 
BUSINESS DEALS, AND SNM COMMANDERS HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO 
SIMILAR ENTERPRISES TO KEEP FROM STARVING.  RESIDUAL 
FIGHTING IS LITTLE MORE THAN INTER-TRIBAL RAIDING.  OUR 
SOURCE SAYS EVERYONE IS READY TO LAY DOWN ARMS AND PEACE 
TALKS ARE SPROUTING LIKE MUSHROOMS.  END SUMMARY. 
- 
3.  COLONEL OMAR ABDULLAHI HANDE, A GADABOURSI (FROM 
BORAMA) CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH ARMED FORCES COMMANDER 
GENERAL \"MASLAH\", CALLED ON AMBASSADOR ON HIS RETURN FROM 
SIX WEEKS IN NORTHWEST SOMALIA MARCH 12.  HE TOLD US HE 
HAD JUST MADE FOLLOWING POINTS IN A REPORT TO PRESIDENT 
SIAD: 
- 
-- PROFITEERING \"WARLORDS\" HAD TAKEN FULL CHARGE OF 
SOMALI ARMY FORCES STATIONED IN THE NORTHWEST.  HE FOUND 
NONE/NONE PROSECUTING THE WAR AGAINST SNM.  INSTEAD, 
ALL SENIOR COMMANDERS WERE DEVOTING THEMSELVES ENTIRELY 
TO BUSINESS DEALS, SELLING SOLDIERS\' RATIONS, FUEL, AND 
AMMUNITION TO BOTH SNM AND TRIBAL FIGHTERS. 
- 
-- FIGHTING NOW GOING ON WAS CONDUCTED ALMOST 
EXCLUSIVELY BY TRIBAL MILITIAS OR \"FRONTS\" AND WAS AIMED 
AT PRESERVING TRIBAL TERRITORIES, HERDS, WATERHOLES, AND 
GRAZING AREAS AGAINST ENCROACHMENTS BY OTHERS (OFTEN BUT 
NOT ALWAYS SNM).  SOLDIERS BELONGING TO LOCAL CLANS HAD 
DESERTED THEIR UNITS AND SHED THEIR UNIFORMS IN ORDER TO 
FIGHT ALONGSIDE TRIBAL BROTHERS; THOSE FROM OUTSIDE THE 
REGION HAD SIMPLY WITHDRAWN TO TOWNS TO WAIT OUT THE WAR. 
- 
-- TRADE IN GUNS AND AMMUNITION HAD BECOME HIGHLY 
PROFITABLE FOR ARMY OFFICERS, SINCE BOTH SNM AND ALLIES 
AND THEIR TRIBAL OPPONENTS WERE BIDDING UP PRICES. 
COMMANDERS WERE ALSO PROFITLNG FROM DESERTION OF THEIR 
TROOPS BY SIMPLY POCKETING SALARIES. 
- 
-- MANY DISPLACED PERSONS (I.E. ISAAKS) WOULD HAVE 
RETURNED HOME LONG AGO HAD THEY NOT BEEN DETERRED FROM 
DOING SO BY BOTH/BOTH SNM AND GOVERNMENT FORCES.  GROWING 
NUMBERS WERE NOW RETURNING, BECAUSE AUTHORITY ON BOTH 
SIDES HAD PRACTICALLY COLLAPSED AND ISAAKS, SUFFERING 
FROM THIRST, HUNGER, DISEASE, AND ABOMINABLE CAMP 
CONDITIONS, WERE DEMANDING TO GO HOME. 
- 
-- AMONG THEMSELVES, TRIBAL LEADERS -- REALIZING THEY HAD 
BECOME VICTIMS AND PAWNS IN THE WAR BETWEEN SIAD AND SNM -- 
WERE NEGOTIATING PEACE AGREEMENTS ON ALL SIDES.  ISAAKS OF 
HABR TOLJALQ   AND HABR YUNIS CLANS HAD SIGNED A TRUCE 
WITH DOLBAHANTA FROM LAS ANOD.  ISAAKS FROM HARGEISA AND 
BORAMA HABR AWAL WERE SUING QADABOURSI FOR PEACE ALONG 
THEIR COMMON TERRITORIAL BORDER EAST OF BORAMA.  A SIMILAR 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN GADABOURSI AND ISSA APPEARED WITHIN 
REACH. 
- 
-- CLOSURE OF DJIBOUTI-BORAMA HIGHWAY HAD BADLY HURT 
COMMUNITIES ALONG THAT ROAD AND FORCED PRICES SKY HIGH IN 
BORAMA.  A 50 KILO BAG OF RICE NOW COST MORE THAN 80,000 
SO.SH., OR ABOUT TWELVE TIMES THE PRICE OF AN AVERAGE 
GOAT.  HOWEVER, GADABOURSI IN BORAMA HAD ESTABLISHED 
ALTERNATIVE TRADE LINKS VIA BERBERA AND WERE RUNNING 
CONVOYS UNDER ARMED (NON-MILITARY) ESCORT FOUR TIMES A 
MONTH, CARRYING LIVESTOCK TO BERBERA PORT AND RETURNING 
WITH SUPPLIES OF FOOD.  (COLONEL OMAR COMMENTED THAT IT 
WAS NOW DJIBOUTI ITSELF THAT WAS SUFFERING MOST FROM 
CLOSURE OF THE ROAD AND LOSS OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY.) 
 
- 
4.  AMBASSADOR COMMENTED TO COLONEL OMAR HE HAD HEARD FROM 
PRIME MINISTER SAMANTAR THAT A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH SNM 
MIGHT BE CONCLUDED AS EARLY AS APRIL.  OMAR SAID THIS WAS 
NOT/NOT BEYOND POSSIBILITY, AS THE SNM LEADERSHIP WAS 
ITSELF COLLAPSING, ITS FORCES HAD TAKEN SEVERAL SEVERE 
DEFEATS AT THE HANDS OF GADABOURSI AND OTHER TRIBAL 
\"FRONTS\" IN RECENT WEEKS, AND ISAAK ELDERS WERE PROBING 
FOR PEACE DEALS AMONG BOTH OTHER TRIBAL GROUPS AND GSDR 
ITSELF.  SNM LEADERS WERE NO LONGER \"TALKING SO TOUGH\" 
AS THEY HAD BEFORE AND ARE SO DIVIDED THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE 
TO HOLD THEIR SCHEDULED CONGRESS.  INDEED, COLONEL OMAR 
SAID, THEY HAVE FALLEN INTO THE SAME HABITS AS SOMALI 
ARMY OFFICERS: USING TRUCKS DONATED BY ISAAK SUPPORTERS TO 
TRANSPORT KHAT AND FOR OTHER PRIVATE COMMERICAL PURPOSES. 
GIVEN THIS SITUATION, PLUS SAMANTAR GOVERNMENT\'S APPARENT 
DETERMINATION TO REACH AGREEMENT SOON IN ORDER TO HOLD 
ELECTIONS, COLONEL OMAR BELIEVED THAT SAMANTAR JUST MIGHT 
BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF. 
 
- 
5.  ONE INTERESTING SIDELIGHT: WITH THE EXHAUSTION OF 
NOMADIC FIGHTERS ON BOTH SIDES OR THE BORDER AND SOLDIERS 
FROM BOTH SIDES SELLING THEIR GUNS TO BUY FOOD, BIGGEST 
PURCHASERS OF WEAPONS HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE THE OROMO 
LIBERATION FRONT.  OMAR POINTED OUT THAT THE OLF (WHICH 
COUNTS ON BACKING FROM SOME 22 MILLION OROMOS, OMAR SAID) 
NOW SEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MENGISTU\'S 
SETBACKS AT THE HANDS OF ERITREANS AND TIGRAYANS AND HAVE 
SUDDENLY GROWN VERY AMBITIOUS. 
 
- 
6.  COMMENT:  COLONEL OMAR\'S ASSIGNMENT, WE INFER, WAS TO 
INSURE THAT THE GADABOURSI AROUND BORAMA REMAIN FIRMLY 
ENROLLED ON THE SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT (THEY ARE IN FACT 
SURROUNDED BY ANTI-GOVERNMENT ISAAK AND ISSA FORCES THAT 
HAVE BEEN TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO BRING BORAMA TO ITS 
KNEES).  OMAR SEEMS TO HAVE GONE BEYOND HIS ASSIGNMENT, 
HOWEVER, TO SURVEY THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL SITUATION 
GENERALLY IN THE NORTHWEST.  HIS REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT 
HAS BOTH BAD NEWS AND GOOD NEWS:  AN UTTERLY INEFFECTIVE 
AND CORRUPT SOMALI ARMY FORCE FACING AN EQUALLY INEFFECTUAL 
AND EXHAUSTED INSURGENCY.  OMAR BELIEVES EVERYONE IS TIRED 
OF THE WAR NOW AND LOOKING FOR PEACE AND WE HOPE HE\'S 
RIGHT.  CERTAINLY PRIME MINISTER SAMANTAR IS COUNTING 
HEAVILY ON THE FATIGUE FACTOR, AS HE MOUNTS HIS RELIEF 
OPERATION FOR RETURNED ISAAKS IN BURAO AND PROMISES A 
PEACE AGREEMENT WITHIN TWO MONTHS.  PERHAPS THERE IS LIGHT 
AT THE END OF THIS DREADFULLY LONG TUNNEL.

SUBJ:  NOVEMBER 11 MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER 
 
REF:  A) STATE 380832 (NOTAL)  B) MOGADISHU 09699 
 
1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE FOREIGN MINISTER WAS PLEASED TO RECEIVE 
AS COHEN\'S LETTER WELCOMING CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND 
ACCEPTED THE POINT THAT THE REGIME\'S COMMITMENT NEEDS TO 
BE  DEMONSTRATED IN CONCRETE FASHION BEFORE IT COULD 
LEAD TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCE FLOWS.  THE MINISTER 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE GSDR HAS OFFERED TO SEND TROOPS 
TO JOIN COALITION FORCES BUT HAD NO WORD ON SAUDI 
REACTION.  HE REPORTED THAT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S TOUR 
OF GCC COUNTRIES IS GOING WELL BUT DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE 
OF SPECIFIC RESULTS.  HE ASKED FOR HELP PERSUADING THE 
REBEL MOVEMENTS TO ATTEND THE CAIRO CONFERENCE AND FOR 
PRESSURE ON THE ETHIOPIANS TO STOP PROVIDING THEM WITH 
SANCTUARY.  FINALLY, HE EMPHASIZED THE URGENT NEED FOR 
EMERGENCY FOOD SHIPMENTS TO MOGADISHU.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  INTRODUCTION: CALLED ON FOREIGN MINISTER 
AHMED MOHAMED ADEN NOVEMBER 11 TO DELIVER AS COHEN\'S 
SECOND MESSAGE (REFTEL A) AS WELL AS THE LETTER I HAD 
PROMISED THE MINISTER ON THE BROOKE AMENDMENT (REFTEL B). 
ASSISTANT MINISTER BASI TOOK NOTES FOR ADEN.  I WAS 
UNACCOMPANIED. 
 
4.  AMERICAN ASSISTANCE:  AFTER READING COHEN\'S LETTER, 
THE MINISTER ASKED IN EFFECT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT.  I 
EXPLAINED THAT COHEN HAD BEEN CONCERNED BY AD/N\'S 
VERY NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO HIS FIRST LETTER.  HE WANTED 
TO UNDERLINE THAT THE USG APPLAUDS THE GSDR\'S INTENTION 
TO LIBERALIZE THE COUNTRY\'S POLITICAL LIFE.  HOWEVER, 
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SKEPTICISM IN WASHINGTON ABOUT 
THE GSDR\'S COMMITMENT.  BEFORE REFORM COULD LEAD TO 
RENEWED ASSISTANCE FLOWS, THERE MUST BE EVIDENCE THAT 
THE REFORMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED, E.G. POLITICAL 
PARTIES MUST HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO FORM AND INDEPENDENT 
NEWSPAPERS ALLOWED TO PUBLISH.  THE BROOKE PROBLEM 
ALSO MUST BE RESOLVED.  AT THAT POINT, I GAVE AD/N A 
LETTER THE USAID DIRECTOR AND I HAD PREPARED ON BROOKE 
AND ITS LOCAL CONSEQUENCES. 
 
5.  RESPONDING, THE MINISTER SAID HE ACCEPTED THE 
REASONABLENESS OF WASHINGTON\'S SKEPTICISM, \"CONSIDERING 
ALL THE HOSTILE PROPAGANDA THERE\".  HE VOLUNTEERED 
THAT ON RE-READING COHEN\'S FIRST LETTER HE HAD FOUND IT 
MORE UNDERSTANDABLE THAN ON FIRST REVIEW.  AD/N SAID 
HE REPEATED TO SIAD WHAT I HAD SALD ABOUT THE 
DIVISION OF LABOR IN RESPONDING TO IRAQI AGGRESSION, I.E. 
GCC COUNTRIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDRESSING THE ECONOMIC 
LOSSES EXPERIENCED BY STATES LIKE SOMALIA, WHILE THE 
USG TAKES ON MOST OF THE HUMAN, POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL 
COSTS OF THE MILITARY RESPONSE.  HE HAD NOT, THE 
MINISTER SAID, SHOWN COHEN\'S FIRST LETTER TO SIAD. 
 
6.  PRIME MINISTER\'S MISSION:  ADRN REPORTED THAT HE HAD 
HEARD BY TELEPHONE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER THAT THE 
LATTER\'S TOUR OF GCC STATES IS GOING WELL.  HOWEVER, 
HE SAID, THE PRIME MINISTER HAD NOT BEEN MORE SPECIFIC. 
I THEN ASKED ABOUT THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION\'S PUBLIC 
OFFER TO HAVE SOMALI TROOPS SERVE ALONGSIDE OTHER 
COALITION MILITARY UNITS, AND AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT THAT 
THE SAUDIS HAD ACCEPTED THIS OFFER.  ADEN SAID HE KNEW THE 
OFFER HAD BEEN MADE BUT HE HAD HEARD NOTHING ABOUT ITS 
ACCEPTANCE.  COMMENTING THAT THE GSDR COULD ONLY SEND A 
FEW HUNDRED SOLDIERS, HE ASKED WHAT DIFFERENCE SUCH 
A SMALL NUMBER COULD MAKE.  I RESPONDED THAT THE ACTIVE 
PARTICIPATION OF ANOTHER ARAB LEAGUE STATE IN THE COALI- 
TION\'S MILITARY FORCES WOULD UNDERLINE THAT SADDAM\'S 
AGGRESSION IS ANATHEMA, EVEN TO THOSE OTHERWISE CLOSEST 
TO HIM.  AFTER ASKING A FEW NEUTRAL QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE DEPLOYMENT OF ADDITIONAL US MILITARY FORCES, THE 
MINISTER EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THE CONFLICT CAN 
BE RESOLVED WITHOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR. 
 
7.  RECONCILIATION:  STATING THAT PEACE IS NECESSARY 
FOR POLITICAL RECONCILIATION, THE FOREIGN MINISTER 
SAID THE GSDR NEEDS THE HELP OF THE ITALIAN, 
BRITISH AND AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS.  HE ASKED THAT ALL 
THREE MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON THE SOMALI REBEL MOVEMENTS 
TO ATTEND THE CAIRO CONFERENCE AND OTHERWISE ENGAGE IN 
RECONCILIATION WITH SIAD\'S REGIME.  HE ALSO ASKED THAT 
PRESSURE BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE ETHIOPIANS TO STOP 
PROVIDING TO THE REBEL MOVEMENTS THE SANCTUARY WHICH 
ALLOWS THEM TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE. 
 
8.  FOOD AID:  THE MINISTER DESCRIBED HUNGER IN MOGADISHU 
AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO PEACE.  NOTING THAT HE HAD BEEN 
INFORMED BY HIS MINISTERIAL COLLEAGUES OF MY DISCUSSIONS 
WITH THEM ON THE SUBJECT, HE PLEADED FOR FASTER AMERICAN 
ACTION.  THE FRENCH, HE SAID, HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE 
3,000 TONS OF WHEAT, AND THE ITALIANS ARE TO FURNISH 4,000 
TONS OF RICE.  I EXPLAINED THAT PREPARATION OF OUR 
PROPOSAL HAS BEEN DELAYED BY THE TIME IT HAS TAKEN TH/ 
RED CRESCENT TO ENGAGE IN SURVEY AND ORGANIZATIONAL WORK 
WITH WHICH IT HAS HAD LITTLE PRIOR EXPERIENCE.  AD/N 
TOOK THE POINT BUT STRESSED THE URGENT NATURE OF THE 
FOOD CRISIS IN THE CAPITAL AND ITS DESTABILIZING POTENTIAL. 
 
9.  APO:  AS THE MEETING ENDED SO THAT THE MINISTER COULD 
MEET WITH SIAD ON THE BROOKE ISSUE, I GAVE HIM THE 
TEXT OF A LETTER REQUIRED AS PART OF OMC\'S PROPOSAL FOR 
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN APO IN MOGADISHU.  I POINTED OUT 
THAT AN APO IS AUTHORIZED BY THE MILITARY ACCESS 
AGREEMENT.  ADEN MADE NO COMMITMENT BUT SEEMED WELL 
DISPOSED.

1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SOMALIA\'S CURRENT MINISTER OF PLAN WAS BORN ABOUT 
55 YEARS AGO IN GAROE IN NORTHERN SOMALIA.  A MAJERTIAN, 
HE CAME TO MOGADISHU AT THE AGE OF 17.  HE WAS TRAINED 
TO BE A TEACHER, FIRST IN SOMALIA AND THEN IN ITALY. 
LATER HE PICKED UP MASTER\'S DEGREES IN INDIA AND AT 
REDDING UNIVERSITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.  AS HE MOVED 
UP THE BUREAUCRATIC LADDER AT THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, 
HE ALSO TOOK SHORT COURSES ABROAD, INCLUDING ONE IN 
PROJECT EVALUATION AT THE WORLD BANK\'S ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE.  IN 1986, HE LEFT HIS HOME MINISTRY 
AFTER SERVING FOURYEARS AS MINISTER WHEN NAMED SECRETARY 
GENERAL OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY.  HE WAS APPOINTED TO 
HIS CURRENT POST EARLIER THIS YEAR.  THE MINISTER TOURED 
THE U.S. ON A USIS GRANT IN 1988, ATTENDING AND ENJOYING 
THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN ATLANTA. 
 
3.  IN A LENGTHY BUT THOUGHTFUL AND WELL ORGANIZED 
DESCRIPTION OF THE CURRENT POLITICAL SCENE DURING MY 
COURTESY CALL NOVEMBER 6, THE MINISTER STRESSED THAT THE 
CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS A CIVILIAN ONE.  IN LANGUAGE AND 
TONE SUGGESTING HE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO WORK 
WITH \"RIGID\" MILITARY OFFICERS, OSMAN WAS CRITICAL OF 
MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL.  HIS 
ANALYSIS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE DIFFICULTY TRYING TO 
INSTILL DEMOCRACY IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH 60 PERCENT OF THE 
POPULATION IS UNDER 25 YEARS OLD AND THUS HAS NO MEMORY 
OR, OR EXPERIENCE WITH, REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT.  HE 
SAID THE REGIME PLANS TO SEND MEMBERS OF THE CABINET INTO 
THE COUNTRYSIDE TO TRY TO EDUCATE THE POPULATION TO 
DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND PROCEDURES (COMMENT - GIVEN THE 
DEGREE OF INSECURITY IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IT IS DOUBTFUL 
MANY MINISTERS WILL VENTURE THERE). 
 
4.  THE MINISTER DESCRIBED AS IRONIC HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO 
PLAN AN ECONOMY WITHOUT RESOURCES.  HE POLITELY CRITICIZED 
THE USG FOR WITHDRAWING ITS SUPPORT, JUST AS THE 
GOVERNMENT BEGINS A PROGRAM OF POLITICAL REFORM.  HE ALSO 
CLAIMED THAT OTHER DONORS ARE TAKING THEIR CUE FROM THE 
USG AND PACKING UP.  WHEN I COUNTERED THAT REFORM IS A 
VERY RECENT PHENOMENON AND THAT OTHER DONORS ARE CUTTING 
BACK THEIR ACTIVITIES DUE TO INSECURITY, INCLUDING DIS- 
ORDERLY AND OCCASIONALLY DEADLY MISBEHAVIOR BY GOVERNMENT 
TROOPS, HE GAVE ME NO ARGUMENT. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  LIKE MANY TEACHERS, OSMAN APPEARS TO ENJOY 
THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE.  BUT HE IS BRIGHT AND 
ARTICULATE.  JUDGING ONLY BY THE CONDUCT OF SEVERAL 
YOUNGER CABINET MEMBERS WHO WERE WITH HIM WHEN WE FIRST 
MET ON A CEREMONIAL OCCASION, HE APPEARS TO ENJOY SOME 
RESPECT AMONG HIS PEERS.

E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR 
TAGS: PINS, PGOV, EAGR, SO 
SUBJECT: NEW OPPOSITION GROUP APPEARS 
 
REF: MOGADISHU 9988 
 
1.  CONDFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  A NOMALI OPPOSITION GROUP, THE SOMALI 
DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, HAS BEEN FORMED.  ACCORDING TO USC 
LEADERS, THE SDM GREW OUT OF THE SO-CALLED \"MESOPOTAMIAN 
MANIFESTO,\" WHICH WAS DRAFTED BY RAHANWEYNE FARMERS TO 
PROTEST GSDR POLICIES, AND ESPECIALLY THE EXPROPRIATION 
OF SOUTHERN FARM LAND TO GIVE TO MAREHAN.  THE USC HAS 
TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO PERSUADE THE GOVERNMENTS OF 
EGYPT AND ITALY TO INVITE THE SDM TO THE CAIRO 
ROUNDTABLE TALKS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  A GROUP OF MEMBERS OF THE LARGELY-AGRICULTURAL 
RAHANWEYNE CLAN HAS ISSUED WHAT THEY CALL \"THE FIRST 
MANIFESTO OF JUBA AND SHABELLE,\" NAMED FOR THE AREA OF 
THE TWO RIVERS OF SOUTHERN SOMALIA WHERE THE RAHANWEYNE 
LIVE.  THE DOCUMENT HAS SINCE BECOME KNOWN ALSO AS THE 
\"MESOPOTAMIAN MANIFESTO.\"  POST IS POUCHING AN 
UNOFFICIAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF THE DOCUMENT TO AF/E. 
 
4.  THE MANIFESTO DETAILS THE EVILS BROUGHT BY THE 
CURRENT CIVIL WAR, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE PROBLEMS CAUSED 
TO FARMERS.  IN PARTICULAR, THE AUTHORS CRITICIZE THE 
GSDR FOR HAVING EXPROPRIATED FARM LAND TO GIVE IT TO 
MAREHAN, WHO FENCED IT OFF, ALLOWED IT TO LIE FALLOW, 
AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEIR STATUS OF \"FARMERS\" TO 
QUALIFY FOR LOANS. 
 
5.  THE MANIFESTO CALLS FOR THE FORMATION OF A 
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT, UNSPECIFIED CQNGES IN THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE REGIONS AND TOWNS OF 
SOMALIA, THE RETURN OF ILLEGALLY-TAKEN STATE PROPERTY 
AND MONEY, AND THE NULLIFICATION OF THE FARM OWNERSHIP 
LAW OF 1975, WHICH THEY HOLD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FALL 
IN FARM PRODUCTION. 
 
6.  THE AUTHORS REJECT THE USE OF ARMED STRUGGLE TO 
REACH THEIR GOALS.  THEY ALSO DISAPPROVE OF THE NEW 
CONSTITUTION \"BECAUSE OF ITS MANY DEFECTS,\" WHICH THEY 
DO NOT ENUMERATE.  THEY CALL FOR A CONFERENCE TO BE 
CONVENED TO PREPARE A NEW CONSTITUTION. 
 
7.  AT A LUNCHEON WITH LEADERS OF THE ABGAL/MURUSADE 
WING OF THE UNITED SOMALI CONGRESS (USC) ON NOVEMBER 
25, THE AMBASSADOR WAS TOLD THAT THE DRAFTERS OF THE 
MESOPOTAMIAN MANIFESTO HAD FORMED AN OPPOSITION GROUP 
CALLED THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, AND THAT THE 
USC HAD--UNSUCCESSFULLY, SO FAR--ASKED THE GOVERNMENTS 
OF EGYPT AND ITALY TO INVITE THE SDM TO THE CAIRO 
ROUNDTABLE TALKS. 
 
8.  COMMENT.  RESENTMENT OVER MAREHAN EXPROPRIATIONS OF 
LAND, MOST OF WHICH OCCURRED YEARS AGO, HAS BEEN 
INCREASING.  AS REPORTED REFTEL, MEMBERS OF A SMALL 
DIR SUB-CLAN, THE BIO-MA\'AL HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN UP ARMS 
AGAINST MAREHAN LAND OWNERS IN THE AREA SOUTH OF 
MOGADISHU. 
 
9.  IT IS NUT SURPRISING THAT THE SDM SHOULD BE 
SUPPORTED BY THE RELATIVELY PACIFIC ABGAL/MURUSADE 
WING OF THE USC.  BOTH GROUPS CALL FOR THE FORMATION OF 
A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE DRAFTING OF A NEW 
CONSTITUTION, ALTHOUGH THE ABGAL/MURUSADE DO NOT REJECT 
THE CURRENT ONE OUTRIGHT.  NEITHER USC WING REJECTS 
ARMED OPPOSITION TO THE GSDR, OF COURSE, BUT THE ABGAL/ 
MURUSADE ARE CLOSE TO THE MANIFESTO GROUP, WHICH 
FAVORS PEACEFUL NEGOTIATION.  END COMMENT.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE ELDERLY RAHENWEYNE LEADER WHO HEADS THE 
SOMALI DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENY  (SDM) SAID HE HAD BROKEN 
A PROMISE WITH SIAD BARRE AND ENTERED THE POLITICAL 
FRAY BECAUSE THE CURRENT REGIME IS EXPIRING AND HE 
DID NOT WANT HIS TRIBE TO MISS OUT IN THE COMPETITION 
FOR POLITICAL POWER.  HE EXPECTED TO ATTEND THE CAIRO 
CONFERENCE AS A MEMBER OF THE MANIFESTO GROUP\'S 
DELEGATION.  HE WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT HIS COUNTRY\'S 
FUTURE AND ANXIOUS FOR MORE AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
- 
3.  BIOGRAPHICS:  ABDULCADIR MOHAMED ADEN (RAHENWEYNE) 
WAS BORN ABOUT 70 YEARS AGO IN BOULA BERTE, WHERE HIS 
FATHER WAS A COLONIAL POLICEMAN.  A MEMBER OF THE 
RAHENWEYNE TRIBE, HE GREW UP IN MOGADISHU AFTER HIS 
FATHER\'S TRANSFER TO THE CAPITAL.  HE BECAME KNOWN AS 
ZOPPO, OR GIMP, DUE TO A PARTIALLY CRIPPLED LEG. 
THE YOUNG SOMALIS\' ASPIRATIONS TO STUDY ABROAD WERE 
FRUSTRATED BY THE FASCIST REGIME. 
 
- 
4.  ZOPPO ENTERED POLITICS DURING THE BRITISH 
OCCUPATION AND BECAME PROMINENT DURING THE 
SUBSEQUENT ITALIAN TRUSTEESHIP.  CONSIDERED BY 
THEM A LEADER OF HIS TRIBE, ZOPPO WAS NAMED 
MINISTER OF FINANCE BY THE FIRST INDEPENDENT 
GOVERNMENT, SHIFTING TO THE MINISTRY OF THE 
INTERIOR IN 1964.  HE LEFT THAT POSITION THREE YEARS 
LATER.  ZOPPO CLAIMED, AT A MEETING WITH ME NOVEMBER 
28, TO HAVE HELPED FINANCE SIAD BARRE\'S COUP IN 1969. 
IN ANY CASE, HE WAS NOT LOCKED UP THEREAFTER, THE 
FATE OF MANY OTHER PROMINENT POLITICIANS.  HE SAID 
THAT HE AND THE NEW PRESIDENT STRUCK A BARGAIN. 
SIAD PROMISED ZOPPO HE WOULD NOT BE ARRESTED, PROVIDED 
HE AND THE RAHENWEYNE WHO FOLLOWED HIS LEADERSHIP 
REFRAINED FROM OPPOSITION OR OTHER FORMS OF POLITICAL 
ACTIVITY. 
 
- 
5.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW YEARS SPENT IN KENYA, 
WHEN ZOPPO WAS FEARFUL THAT SIAD\'S ADOPTION OF SCIENTIFIC 
SOCIALISM BODED ILL FOR A PROMINENT AND SUCCESSFUL 
CAPITALIST, HE HAS CONTINUED TO RESIDE IN MOGADISHU. 
ACCORDING TO THE RAHENWEYNE ELDER, WHEN SIAD 
DECIDED TO SEEK A REAPPROACHMENT WITH THE UNITED 
STATES, THE PRESIDENT COMMISSIONED HIM TO OPEN 
CHANNELS TO WASHINGTON.  HE CLAIMED TO HAVE DONE SO 
THROUGH ITALIAN CONNECTIONS AND TO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AT 
THE CARTER WHITE HOUSE.  HIS CURRENT BUSINESS INTERESTS 
INCLUDE A BANANA PLANTATION NEAR SHALANBOD, REAL 
ESTATE IN MOGADISHU, AND REPRESENTATION OF OVERSEAS 
FIRMS.  ZOPPO IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE MOST 
INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL FIGURE IN SOUTHERN SOMALIA. 
ZOPPO HAS FIVE GROWN CHILDREN, ONE OF WHOM IS 
STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA.  ZOPPO HAS A 
CATARACT ON ONE EYE, WHICH HE PLANS TO HAVE REMOVED 
IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER HIS UPCOMING TRIP TO 
EUROPE. 
 
- 
6. THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC MOVENENT:  WHILE DECRYING 
TRIBALISM AS SOMALIA\'S CURSE, ZOPPO READILY 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE POLITICAL PARTY HE LEADS 
REPRESENTS ONLY HIS FELLOW RAHENWEYNE TRIBESMEN.  ASKED 
WHY HE HAD VIOLATED HIS PACT WITH SIAD TO ENGAGE AGAIN 
IN POLITICS, HE REPLIED THAT WITH THE REGIME NEARING ITS/ND 
AND  THE OTHER TRIBAL GROUPS ORGANIZING TO FURTHER THEIR 
OWN INTERESTS, HE DID NOT WANT RAHENWEYNE LEFT OUT OF 
THE COMPETITION FOR POWER.  DISCLAIMING ANY PERSONAL 
AMBITION, HE SAID HE IS TOO OLD AND INFIRM TO SEEK 
THE PRESIDENCY, AN OFFICE WHICH MIGHT, HOWEVER, BE 
OCCUPIED BY ONE OF HIS KINSMEN.  HE SAID HE CONSIDERED 
THE HAWIYE-BASED UNITED SOMALI CONGRESS A NATURAL ALLY, 
MENTIONING THAT HE HAD MET WITH ITS MOGADISHU LEADERSHIP 
THE PREVIOUS  EVENING AT THE HOME OF MOHAMED 
FARAH SIAD. 
 
- 
7.  THE CAIRO CONFERENCE:  THE RAHENWEYNE LEADER SAID 
THAT IN MEETINGS WITH THE MANIFESTO GROUP AND ITALIAN 
AMBASSADOR SICA IT WAS AGREED THAT ZOPPO WILL 
PARTICIPATE IN THE CAIRO ROUNDTABLE AS A MEMBER OF THE 
MANIFESTO GROUP\'S DELEGATION.  THIS TACTIC IS BEING 
ADOPTED TO HELP THE ITALIANS DEFLECT ATTEMPTS BY OTHER 
LESS REPRESENTATIVE GROUPS TO OBTAIN INVITATIONS TO 
THE MEETING.  SICA SUPPOSEDLY AGREED THAT THE SDM WILL 
BE INVITED TO ANY SUBSEQUENT ROUNDTABLE MEETINGS IN 
ITS OWN NAME.  ZOPPO PLANS TO VISIT LONDON EN ROUTE 
TO CAIRO, IN ORDER TO URGE THE SNM TO ATTEND THE FIRST 
ROUNDTABLE, IF THE NORTHERN DISSIDENTS HAVE NOT YET 
ACCEPTED THEIR INVITATION TO THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL. 
 
- 
8.  MOHAMED SIAD BARRE:  STATING THAT HE HAD KNOWN 
THE PRESIDENT FOR SOME 45 YEARS, ZOPPO SAID THAT SIAD 
HAS BECOME VERY ERRATIC SINCE HIS 1986 AUTOMOBILE 
ACCIDENT.  THE RAHENWEYNE LEADER EXPRESSED THE BELIEF 
THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S MOOD SHIFTS ARE SIDE EFFECTS 
PRODUCED BY DRUGS HE HAS TAKEN SINCE THE ACCIDENT. 
HE ASSERTED THEY ARE NOT SIMPLY THE CONSEQUENCE 
OF ADVANCING AGE OR OF THE ONSET OF SENILITY. ZOPPO 
SAID SIAD AND HIS FAMILY ARE NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN 
REFORM.  THE SOLE EXCEPTION IS ABDIRAHMAN JAMA BARRE, 
WHO TOLD THE FAMILY AFTER RETURNING FROM THIS YEAR\'S 
IMF/IBRD MEETINGS AND SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS IN ROME 
THAT THE REGIME HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT POLITICAL 
REFORM. 
 
- 
9.  PROSPECTS:  GIVEN THE TENACITY OF TRIBALISM IN 
SOMALI POLITICS, AND THE FAILURE OF SIAD\'S OPPONENTS 
TO AGREE ON A STRATEGY FOR COOPERATION IN A POST-SIAD 
SOMALIA, THE ELDER STATESMAN SAID HE FEARED FOR THE 
FUTURE.  HE WAS PARTICULARLY UPSET WITH THE SNM, 
WHICH HE ACCUSED OF TOTALLY IMPRACTICAL SECESSIONIST 
AMBITIONS.  HIS MESSAGE TO ME WAS A PLEA FOR GREATER 
AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT IN SOMALIA\'S ACCELERATING QITICAL 
EVOLUTION.

END TEXT. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT.  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE 
DECREE APPLIES ONLY TO MOGADISHU. 
 
NOTE: RECEIVED WITHOUT REF. NUMBER. CORRECTION TO FOLLOW. 
 
4.  (C)  THE DECREE IS BROAD AND VAGUE.  THE 
LANGUAGE APPLYING TO \"ANYONE WHO ACTS IN A WAY 
THAT WEAKENS THE GOVERNMENT POLICY ON MAINTAINING 
SECURITY, UNITY, AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE 
GOVERNMENT\" AND ALLOWING THE DETENTION FOR UP 
TO ONE YEAR OF ANYONE \"SEEN AS A THREAT TO NATIONAL 
SECURITY\" COULD BE APPLIED TO ALMOST ANYONE OPPOSING 
THE GOVERNMENT; THAT IS TO SAY, TO ALMOST ANYBODY. 
 
5.  (C) SEVERAL SPECIFIC ARTICLES OF THE NEW 
CONSTITUTION ARE POTENTIALLY AFFECTED BY THIS 
DECREE.  ARTICLE 84, PARAGRAPH 1 ALLOWS THE 
PRESIDENT TO \"ADOPT PREVENTATIVE MEASURES\" IN 
SITUATIONS THAT \"MAY PLACE THE SOVEREIGNTY, THE 
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, THE INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL 
SECURITY, OR THE FUNCTIONING OF THE COUNTRY INTO 
GRAVE DANGER.\"  PARAGRAPH 2 OF THE SAME ARTICLE, 
HOWEVER, SAYS SUCH MEASURES MUST BE PRESENTED TO 
THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY WITHIN 30 DAYS FOR 
APPROVAL, AND THE LAW CANNOT BE VALID FOR MORE 
THAN SIX MONTHS, ACCORDING TO PARAGRAPH 3. 
 
6.  (C) ARTICLE 25, PARAGRAPH 2 PROHIBITS ARRESTS 
EXCEPT OF THOSE CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF COMMITING 
AN OFFENSE, OR BY ORDER OF A COURT.  ALTHOUGH 
THERE IS AN EXCEPTION FOR CASES OF \"URGENT 
NECESSITY,\" SUCH ARRESTS MUST BE BROUGHT TO THE 
ATTENTION OF THE JUDICIARY WITHIN 48 HOURS SO THAT 
THE VALIDITY OF THE ARREST CAN BE EXAMINED. 
 
7.  (C) ARTICLE 27 ALLOWS EXPR/PRIATION OF PRIVATE 
PROPERTY ONLY FOR \"REASONS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,\" 
AND IN EXCHANGE FOR JUST COMPENSATION. 
 
8.  (C) WHATEVER THE SPECIFIC VIOLENCE DONE TO THE 
PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION, THIS SORT OF 
DECREE, ALLOWING THE ARREST, WITHOUT WARRANT 
OR APPEAL, FOR A BROAD VARIETY OF OFFENSES, CLEARLY 
RUNS COUNTER TO THE SPIRIT OF THE DOCUMENT. 
 
9.  (C) THE NEW DECREE, ON TOP OF THE RECENT ARRESTS 
OF OPPOSITION FIGURES (SEPTEL), WILL UNDOUBTEDLY 
BE VIEWED BY THE OPPOSITION AS AN ACT OF BAD FAITH 
ON THE PART OF THE SIAD GOVERNMENT.  END COMMENT.

- 
2.  WE NOW HAVE A CLEARER PICTURE, IN PART BASED 
ON EYE-WITNESS REPORTS, OF THE KILLINGS THAT TOOK 
PLACE AT THE ANIMAL MARKET IN NORTHEAST MOGADISHU 
ON DECEMBER 6 (REFTEL).  A MAN WHO WAS SITTING AT A 
COFFEE HOUSE NEAR THE MARKET DURING THE INCIDENT 
SAYS THAT A TOYOTA PICK-UP TRUCK CARRYING FIVE UNIFORMED 
MEN AND A BROWNING MACHINE-GUN PULLED UP TO THE MARKET AND 
BEGAN FIRING AT THE CROWD, WHICH WAS GOING ABOUT ITS 
NORMAL BUSINESS.  SEVERAL MEN IN THE CROWD RAN TO THEIR 
HOMES TO GET THEIR AK-47S, AND RETURNED FIRE.  THE 
UNIFORMED MEN FLED IN THEIR PICK-UP TRUCK. 
 
- 
3.  A BYSTANDER ON A MOTOR SCOOTER FOLLOWED THE 
PICK-UP TRUCK UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE 
GARRISON OF THE 77TH MILITARY SECTOR.  BACK AT THE 
SCENE OF  THE SHOOTING, POLICE ARRIVED AND ARRESTED 
THE MEN WHO HAD FIRED ON THE SOLDIERS. 
 
- 
4.  AN FSN\'S SISTER, WHO LIVES NEAR THE MARKET,  SAYS 
SHE COUNTED 12 DEAD BODIES, AND THAT TWO OTHERS DIED 
LATER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND AN ADDITIONAL THREE 
AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL. 
 
- 
5.  RADIO MOGADISHU REPORTED ON DECEMBER 6 THAT 
TEN PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED BY \"BANDITS\" AT THE 
ANIMAL MARKET, AND THAT THREE SUSPECTS HAD BEEN 
ARRESTED.  ON DECEMBER 7, HOWEVER, RADIO MOGADISHU 
REVISED ITS ESTIMATE, \"AFTER LONG INVESTIGATIONS,\" 
TO TWO DEAD AND FOUR WOUNDED. 
 
- 
6.  ON DECEMBER 7, A GROUP OF HAWIYE ELDERS MET 
WITH ARMED FORCES COMMANDER GENERAL MOHAMED 
SAID HERSI \"MORGAN,\" ACCORDING TO THE SON OF 
ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS.  IN THIS MEETING, MORGAN 
IS SAID TO HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PERPETRATORS 
WERE GALGALA AND MAREHAN MEMBERS OF THE 77TH SECTOR 
GARRISON.  HE PROMISED TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE, 
AND BLAMED THE SOLDIERS\' BEHAVIOR ON THE TONE 
SET BY HIS PREDECESSOR, GENERAL ABDURAHMAN MOHAMED 
SAID \"MASLAH.\"  HE DID NOT SAY THAT THE GUILTY 
SOLDIERS HAD BEEN OR WOULD BE ARRESTED, HOWEVER. 
ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACT, THE ELDERS WERE IMPRESSED 
BY MORGAN AND WERE WILLING TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO 
IMPROVE THE ARMY\'S BEHAVIOR TOWARD CIVILIANS. 
 
- 
7.  COMMENT.  THE ACCOUNT IN PARAS 2 THROUGH 4 
IS CONSISTENT WITH LESS-DETAILED VERSIONS WE 
HAD RECEIVED EARLIER.  IF THE REPORT OF MORGAN\'S 
REMARKS IS AUTHENTIC, IT WILL CONFIRM HAWIYE IN 
THEIR BELIEF THAT GALAGAL CLANSMEN ARE COLLABORATING 
WITH MAREHAN TO MURDER HAWIYE.  END COMMENT.

SUBJ:  DISCUSSION WITH GENERAL MOHAMED ALI SAMANTAR 
 
1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SETTING:  ALTHOUGH GENERAL SAMANTAR CURRENTLY HOLDS 
NO OFFICIAL POSITION, HE REMAINS ONE OF SOMALIA\'S 
PRINCIPAL POLITICAL FIGURES.  ACCORDINGLY, I CALLED ON 
HIM AT HIS QUARTERS DECEMBER 4.  I FOUND HIM LIVING 
IN A VERY LARGE AND ELABORATELY FURNISHED HOME WITHIN 
THE PERIMETER OF THE MOGADISHU OFFICERS\' CLUB.  HE WAS 
IN APPARENT GOOD HEALTH AND SPIRITS, ALTHOUGH JUDGING 
BY THE CONDITION OF HIS FINGERS HE BITES HIS NAILS 
A LOT. 
- 
3.  DOMESTIC POLITICS:  THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, 
PRIME MINISTER, DEFENSE MINISTER, ARMY COMMANDER, ETC. 
PUT NO DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE REGIME.  HE WAS 
CRITICAL OF THE OPPOSITION FOR ITS ALLEGED COMPLICITY 
IN THE VIOLENCE WHICH HAS PLAGUED MOGADISHU FOR 
MONTHS.  (HE ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE HEAVY FIGHTING 
OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WAS TRIBAL IN ORIGIN.)  AFTER 
BLAMING  THE OPPOSITION FOR MUCH OF THE OTHER VIOLENCE, 
HE ASKED RHETORICALLY HOW ITS LEADERS COULD EXPECT THE 
NEW CONSTITUTION TO FUNCTION IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT. 
HE DID NOT ADVOCATE ABANDONMENT OF THE POLITICAL REFORM 
PROCESS, BUT HE ALSO HAD THE FRANKNESS TO MAKE IT CLEAR 
HE IS NOT ITS ARDENT SUPPORTER.  WHEN THE CAIRO ROUNDTABLE 
WAS RAISED, HIS OBJECTIVE FOR THE MEETING SEEMED LIMITED 
TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CEASE-FIRE. 
- 
4. ISLAMIC FERMENT:  THE GENERAL SPOKE MOST INTERESTINGLY 
ON THE SUBJECT OF TURBULENCE WITH THE LOCAL ISLAMIC 
COMMUNITY.  WITH OBVIOUS REGRET, HE SAID FOREIGN 
INFLUENCES ARE DISTURBING A COMMUNITY WHICH HAD BEEN 
NOTED FOR ITS TOLERANCE AND PEACEFULNESS.  THE VILLIANS 
HE IDENTIFIED INCLUDED MILITANTS FOR THE SEVERAL SUFI 
ORDERS WHICH HAVE LONG EXISTED IN SOMALIA, AS WELL AS 
MORE RECENTLY ARRIVED SECTS, E.G. THE WAHHABI OF 
SAUDI ARABIA.  ALTHOUGH HARDLY A RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT, 
SAMANTAR MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE YOUNG SOMALIS WHO 
GO TO IRAQ TO STUDY ON IRAQI SCHOLARSHIPS RETURN AS 
BAATHISTS.  FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, HE CONSIDERED THIS 
ELEMENT AMONG THE MOST POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE, ALTHOUGH 
QUITE LIMITED IN INFLUENCE AT THE MOMENT.  THE WHOLE 
PHENOMENON OF RELIGIOUS FERMENT HE CONSIDERED MORE 
SIGNIFICANT FOR SOMALIA\'S FUTURE THAN IT IS AT 
PRESENT, WHERE HE SAW ITS IMPACT AS MARGINAL. 
- 
5.  THE GULF:  NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE COMBAT VETERAN 
RAISED THE PROSPECTS OF WAR IN THE GULF.  HE DESCRIBED 
SADDAM HUSSEIN, WHOM HE MET WHILE THEY WERE VICE 
PRESIDENTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, AS A PARTICULARLY 
AGGRESSIVE AND AMBITIOUS MAN.  HE PROFESSED DOUBT THAT 
MANY SOMALIS ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE REGIME\'S SUPPORT 
FOR THE COALITION BUT SUBSEQUENTLY CONCEDED THAT MANY 
UNEDUCATED SOMALIS ADMIRE THE IRAQI LEADER FOR 
DEFYING THE INFIDELS. 
- 
6.  PERSONAL ROLE:  WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO INDICATE 
RESENTMENT, SAMANTAR MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE CONSIDERED 
HIS CURRENT ABSENCE FROM OFFICE EXCEPTIONAL.  REFERRING 
TO HIMSELF SEVERAL TIMES AS \"A POLITICAL MAN\", HE 
MADE NO SECRET OF THE FACT THAT HE REMAINS POLITICALLY 
ACTIVE, ALBEIT FROM A POSITION ON THE SIDELINES 
RATHER THAN CENTERFIELD.

- 
2.  ON DECEMBER 17, POLOFF SPOKE WITH ABDULAHI 
MOALLIM, A HAWIYE LAWYER SPECIALIZING IN HUMAN 
RIGHTS ISSUES.  MOALLIM WAS ONE OF THE SIX DRAFTERS 
OF THE NEW SOMALI CONSTITUTION. 
 
- 
3.  MOALLIM SAID HE WAS DISILLUSIONED BY THE GSDR\'S LACK 
OF RESPECT FOR THE CONSTITUTION, AND LISTED 13 
VIOLATIONS, INCLUDING ILLEGAL ARRESTS, PROPERTY 
SEIZURES, AND KILLINGS, OF ITS TERMS SINCE ITS 
IMPLEMENTATION.  MOALLIM ALSO CALLED THE NEW 
SECURITY DECREE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND MAINTAINED 
THAT ITS ISSUANCE WAS A MISUSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
PROVISION ALLOWING PRESIDENTIAL DECREES.  THESE 
SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR \"TRUE EMERGENCIES,\" HE SAID. 
 
- 
4.  WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE WOULD STILL BE WILLING 
TO SERVE ON THE GSDR DELEGATION TO ROUND TABLE TALKS 
WITH THE OPPOSITION, WERE THESE TO BE RESCHEDULED, 
MOALLIM CLAIMED HE HAD NEVER BEEN WILLING TO SIT ON 
THE GOVERNMENT\'S SIDE.  HIS NAME HAD BEEN PUT ON THE 
LIST WITHOUT HIS BEING ASKED. 
 
- 
5.  NEVERTHELESS, MOALLIM CONTINUED, HE BELIEVED THAT 
TALKS BETWEEN THE GSDR AND ITS OPPONENTS HAD SOME 
CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING AND WERE THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID 
A VIOLENT END TO THE SIAD REGIME.  HE BELIEVED, HOWEVER, 
THAT THE EGYPTIAN AND ITALIAN GOVERNMENTS WERE FED UP 
WITH SIAD\'S TERGIVERSATIONS AND DOUBTED THEY WOULD BE 
WILLING TO RESCHEDULE THE ROUND TABLE TALKS.  NOBODY 
TRUSTS SIAD, HE SAID, AND RECONCILIATION IS UNLIKELY 
TO TAKE PLACE UNTIL SIAD RESIGNS, A STEP MOALLIM 
BELIEVES SIAD WILL BE COMPELLED TO TAKE. 
 
- 
6.  COMMENT.  MOALLIM\'S GLOOM REGARDING THE 
CONSTITUTION AND PEACEFUL RECONCILIATION IS 
REMARKABLE BECAUSE, SIX WEEKS AGO, HE WAS THE 
MOST OPTIMISTIC OF THE EMBASSY\'S CONTACTS 
(REFTEL).  HIS CONTINUED BELIEF IN THE POSSIBILITY 
OF A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO SOMALIA\'S POLITICAL 
CRISIS STILL SHOWS HIM TO BE MORE SANGUINE THAN 
MOST OF OUR OTHER CONTACTS. 
 
- 
7.  ALL PARTIES SEEM TO WANT TO CLAIM MOALLIM FOR 
THEIR SIDE.  IN ADDITION TO BEING ADDED TO THE 
GSDR DELEGATION WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION, MOALLIM 
EARLIER THIS YEAR WAS FALSELY LISTED AS A SIGNER 
OF THE MAY MANIFESTO.  END COMMENT.

2.  ON DECEMBER 17, DCM HOSTED A LUNCHEON FOR 
SEVERAL SIGNERS OF THE MAY MANIFESTO.  THEY ARE: 
GENERAL ABDULAHI MOHAMED HASSAN, FORMER COMMANDER 
OF THE SOMALI POLICE AND A MAJERTAIN (BIO DETAILS 
FOLLOW SEPTEL); MOHAMOUD SALAH NOOR, ADOLBAHANTE 
AND FORMER LABOR OFFICIAL; ABDULAZIZ NOOR HERSI, 
A LAWYER AND MEMBER OF THE MAJERTAIN CLAN, 
AND MOHAMED GIAMA, A MAJERTAIN AND FORMER AMBASSADOR 
TO THE EC AND FORMER MINISTER OF COMMERCE.  ALSO 
PRESENT WERE OSMAN SAMANTAR, A PROMINENT MAJERTAIN 
BUSINESSMAN, AMBASSADOR BISHOP AND POLOFF. 
 
- 
3.  PEACEFUL RECONCILIATION.  THE GUESTS WERE 
DISCOURAGED BY THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE CAIRO 
ROUND TABLE TALKS, AND BLAMED IT ON THE GSDR 
FOR HAVING ISSUED A STRICT NEW SECURITY DECREE 
AND HAVING ARRESTED SEVERAL MANIFESTO SIGNERS 
(NOTE.  AMBASSADOR GIAMA WAS ONE OF THREE 
MANIFESTO SIGNERS DETAINED FOR APPROXIMATELY 
TWO DAYS DURING THE VIOLENCE IN MOGADISHU TWO 
WEEKS AGO).  ALTHOUGH THOSE DETAINED WERE NOW FREE, 
THE GROUP MADE CLEAR THAT DIALOGUE WITH THE GSDR 
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS THE SECURITY DECREE 
IS IN FORCE.  MOREOVER, THEY SAID, THEY HAD 
RECEIVED NO INDICATION THAT CHARGES AGAINST 
THE DETAINEES HAD BEEN DROPPED. 
 
- 
4.  THE MANIFESTO GROUP HAD BELIEVED THE NEW 
CONSTITUTION TO BE A STEP FORWARD; BUT NOW, THEY 
SAID, PRESIDENT SIAD HAD BLOCKED THE PATH OF 
PEACEFUL RECONCILIATION, LEAVING ONLY VIOLENCE 
AS A MEANS OF RESOLVING SOMALIA\'S CRISIS. 
NEVERTHELESS, THEY STILL BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT 
A PEACEFUL, NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS NECESSARY. 
 
- 
5.  ROLE OF THE U.S.  THE GROUP EXPRESSED THANKS 
FOR THE USG HAVING CUT AID TO THE GSDR.  BY CONTRAST, 
THEY CRITICIZED THE GULF STATES AND ITALY FOR THEIR 
CONTINUED AID TO THE SIAD GOVERNMENT.  THEY ASKED 
THE U.S. TO PERSUADE THE GULF STATES NOT TO AID THE 
GSDR, AT LEAST NOT BY GIVING CASH, WHICH IS USED 
ONLY FOR WEAPONS PURCHASES AND PERSONAL ENRICHMENT. 
THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THE LOGIC BEHIND THE GULF 
STATES AIDING THOSE GOVERNMENTS THAT SUPPORT THE 
POSITION OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND THAT HAVE BEEN 
HURT ECONOMICALLY BY THE GULF CRISIS.  HE ALSO 
POINTED OUT THAT THE GULF STATES ANNOUNCED THEIR 
USD 70 MILLION AID FOR SOMALIA AT A TIME WHEN 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM LOOKED MORE PROMISING THAN 
IT DOES NOW. 
 
- 
6.  THE GUESTS ALSO ASKED THE U.S. TO CONTINUE 
TO PERSUADE BOTH THE GSDR AND THE VARIOUS 
OPPOSITION GROUPS TO NEGOTIATE WITH ONE ANOTHER. 
MOHAMOUD SALAH NOOR DISAGREED WITH THE AMBASSADOR\'S 
REMARK THAT U.S. INFLUENCE WITH THE GSDR WAS NOW 
LIMITED PRECISELY BECAUSE WE HAD SLASHED AID. 
NOOR MAINTAINED THAT THE OPPOSITE WAS TRUE: WITHOUT 
U.S. AID, SIAD\'S POSITION WAS MORE DESPERATE THAN 
EVER.  HE WOULD THUS BE WILLING TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING 
TO GET THE MONEY FLOWING AGAIN. 
 
- 
7.  FEDERALISM AND SOMALIA.  THE GUESTS ALL 
SEEMED TO HAVE READ DAS HICKS\' SPEECH ON 
FEDERALISM AND THE HORN OF AFRICA (USIS HAS 
DISTRIBUTED MORE THAN 100 COPIES, AND CONTINUES 
TO RECEIVE REQUESTS FOR MORE).  DESPITE ARGUMENT 
TO THE CONTRARY, ALL SOMALIS PRESENT SEEMED TO 
EQUATE FEDERALISM WITH PARTITION, WHICH THEY DO NOT 
WANT FOR SOMALIA.  ONE PARTICIPANT MAINTAINED THAT A 
FEDERAL SYSTEM WOULD INVITE THE SNM AND OTHERS BENT ON 
SECESSION TO DESTROY THE UNITY OF SOMALIA. 
 
- 
8.  THE MILITARY SITUATION.  SAMANTAR, WHO IS 
A CLANSMAN AND CLOSE FRIEND OF GENERAL MORGAN, 
CLAIMED THAT THE GENERAL HAD LEFT MOGADISHU FOR 
THE CENTRAL REGIONS ON DECEMBER 16, ACCOMPANYING 
TWO CONTAINERS FILLED WITH SOMALI SHILLINGS (SOSH). 
THE MONEY, ACCORDING TO SAMANTAR, WOULD BE DISHED 
OUT 100,000 SOSH PER DEAD BODY, TO THOSE WHO KILLED 
THE ENEMY.  SAMANTAR SAID MORGAN HAD ONLY 1,000 
POORLY-TRAINED RECRUITS AT HIS COMMAND FOR HIS 
CENTRAL REGION OFFENSIVE.  MOST OF THEM ARE OGADENI, 
HOT TO REVENGE HAWIYE ATTACKS ON THEIR REFUGEE 
CAMPS IN THE CENTRAL REGION. 
 
- 
9.  SAMANTAR ALSO CLAIMED THAT GENERAL MORGAN 
WOULD SOON TRAVEL TO CAIRO, AND THAT THE ROUND 
TABLE TALKS WOULD BE RESCHEDULED FOR MID-JANUARY. 
 
- 
10.  COMMENT.  LATER THE SAME DAY, THE EGYPTIAN 
AMBASSADOR TOLD AMBASSADOR BISHOP THAT THE GOE 
WOULD SOON LAUNCH A UNILATERAL PEACE INITIATIVE, 
CONSISTING OF INVITING THE VARIOUS PARTIES OF 
THE SOMALI CONFLICT ONE-BY-ONE TO CAIRO FOR 
DISCUSSIONS.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MORGAN\'S VISIT 
TO CAIRO WILL FALL WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK.  ON THE 
OTHER HAND, HE MIGHT SIMPLY INTEND TO ASK FOR ARMS. 
 
- 
11.  WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING CONFLICTING INFORMATION 
ON THE PROGRESS OF GENERAL MORGAN\'S OFFENSIVE, 
ALTHOUGH NONE OF IT POINTS TO SUCCESS.  NUMEROUS 
SOMALI ARMY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN FLOWING BACK INTO 
MOGADISHU AND THERE ARE REPORTS OF RENEWED FIGHTING 
NEAR JOHAR AND MAHADE WEYNE, ABOUT 100 KM FROM THE 
CAPITAL. 
 
- 
12.  THE GROUP\'S RESPONSE TO DAS HICKS\' SPEECH IS 
TYPICAL OF THOSE WE HAVE RECEIVED SO FAR:  PLEASURE 
THAT SOMEONE IS GIVING SERIOUS THOUGHT TO THE 
HORN AND ITS PROBLEMS, GREAT INTEREST IN THE SPEECH, 
BUT STRONG RESISTANCE TO THE IDEA OF FEDERALISM FOR 
THIS COUNTRY.  END COMMENT.

COUNTRY\'S MALAISE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. INTRODUCTION:  OVER LUNCH DECEMBER 19, ABDIRAHMAN 
JAMA MOHAMED, MINISTER OF LIVESTOCK,FORESTRY AND RANGE, 
IDENTIFIED PRESIDENT SIAD BARRE AS THE PRINCIPAL STUMBLING 
BLOCK TO PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF SOMALIA\'S MOUNTING 
POLITICAL TURMOIL.  AN ISSAK FROM HARGESIA, THE 
YOUTHFUL MINISTER WARMLY BUT PRIVATELY ENDORSED FORMER 
PRIME MINISTER MOHAMMED EGAL\'S PUBLIC CALL THIS WEEK 
FOR SIAD\'S RESIGNATION.  ABDIRAHMAN SAID HE FOUND EGAL\'S 
PROPOSED SUCCESSION SCENARIO QUITE REASONABLE.  HOWEVER, 
WHEN ASKED IF HE THOUGHT SIAD BARRE WOULD AGREE TO 
STEP DOWN, ABDIRAHMAN SHOOK HIS HEAD SLOWLY AND SADLY. 
ASKED WHAT PROCEDURE CURRENTLY EXISTS FOR PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION OF OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE REGIME 
AND THE REBELS, THE MINISTER SAID SOURCES WITHIN THE 
GOVERNMENT STATE THAT THE CAIRO ROUNDTABLE HAS BEEN 
RESCHEDULED FOR MID-JANUARY.  I THEN BRIEFED HIM ON MY 
DISCUSSION WITH THE EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR, WHO TOLD ME 
THAT NO NEW DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR THE PUTATIVE TALKS 
IN THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL. 
 
- 
4.  CAIRO CONFERENCE:  IN DISCUSSING THE POSTPONEMENT OF 
THE MEETING IN CAIRO, THE MINISTER SAID THE ORDERS TO 
ARREST THE MANIFESTO GROUP MEMBERS CAME DIRECTLY FROM 
SIAD.  HE WAS ANGRY WHEN HE DISCOVERED THEY INTENDED TO 
CONSULT WITH THE SNM IN LONDON EN ROUTE TO CAIRO.  WHEN 
IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TWO GROUPS 
CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE MET IN CAIRO AND THAT SENIOR GSDR 
OFFICIALS ROUTINELY CONTACT SENIOR SNM OFFICIALS WHEN 
IN LONDON, ABDIRAHMAN SMILED WEAKLY. 
 
- 
5. VIOLENCE:  IN AN EXCHANGE ON THE VIOLENCE WHICH HAS 
PROMPTED THE EVACUATION OF SO MANY FOREIGN ASSISTANCE 
PERSONNEL, THE MINISTER BLAMED THE SOMALI MILITARY FOR 
THE ONGOING MURDERS AND ROBBERIES.  HE OPINED THAT THE 
DETACHMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR SIAD\'S PROTECTION, NOW 
COMPOSED SOLELY OF MAREHAN TRIBE MEMBERS, SEES THE END 
OF THE REGIME AND THEIR OWN PROTECTED STATUS COMING. 
CONSEQUENTLY, THEY ARE TRYING TO BUILD UP PERSONAL 
FINANCIAL RESERVES BY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.  HE CLAIMED 
THAT EVEN SIAD BARRE HAS HAD PERSONAL VEHICLES STOLEN 
BY SOLDIERS ASSIGNED TO GUARD HIM.  THE MINISTER SUBSE- 
QUENTLY REQUESTED MY ASSISTANCE OBTAINING VISAS FOR 
YOUNG RELATIVES HE WANTED TO HELP LEAVE SOMALIA TO AVOID 
BOTH VIOLENCE AND BEING IMPRESSED INTO THE SOMALI 
NATIONAL ARMY. 
 
- 
6. AID SUSPENSION:  ABDIRAHMAN TOOK THE OCCASION TO WARN 
ME THAT MANY SENIOR MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT HOLD ME PER- 
SONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUSPENSION OF AMERICAN 
ASSISTANCE, WHICH THEY CONSIDER AN OVER-REACTION TO THE 
ONGOING VIOLENCE.  HIS ACCOUNT WAS SIMILAR TO THAT GIVEN 
ME A FEW DAYS EARLIER BY THE MINISTER OF MINERAL RESOURCES 
(REFTEL C).  HE ADVISED ME TO SEE THE PRIME MINISTER TO 
TRY TO CLEAR THE AIR. 
 
- 
7. NATIONAL PROSPECTS:  THE MINISTER\'S DOWNBEAT 
ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT SCENE GAVE RISE TO EVIDENT 
PESSIMISM ABOUT SOMALIA\'S FUTURE.  HE RULED OUT 
FEDERALISM AS INCONSISTENT WITH SOMALIA\'S POVERTY, 
FACTIONALISM AND THE NOMADIC LIFESTYLE OF MOST OF ITS 
PEOPLE.  BUT HE RELENTED WHEN IT WAS NOTED THAT 
FEDERALISM COULD MEAN NO MORE THAN TWO FEDERATED POLITICAL 
UNITS.  HE HAD PRESUMED IT MUST ENTAIL THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF ELABORATE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES IN EACH OF THE 
COUNTRY\'S 20 REGIONS.  HE DID STATE HIS BELIEF THAT BOTH 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND FINANCE MINISTER JAMA BARRE HAVE 
NATIONAL INTERESTS AT HEART, AND HE URGED THAT I WORK 
CLOSELY WITH THEM. 
 
- 
8.  HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:  IN REVIEWING WHAT DIVIDES 
SOMALIS, THE MINISTER FOCUSED ON THE DIFFERENT VALUE 
SYSTEMS TO WHICH SOMALIS WERE EXPOSED IN BRITISH AND 
ITALIAN ADMINISTERED SOMALIA.  NORTHERNERS FIND IT 
IRKSOME, HE UNDERLINED, TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOUTHERNERS, 
BECAUSE THEY APE THE ITALIANS\' CORRUPTION, INCOMPETENCE, 
AND TOLERANCE FOR SHODDY WORK.

SUBJ:  DECEMBER 22, 1990 MEETING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER 
 
REF:  MOGADISHU 08583 
 
1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY:  THE PRIME MINISTER ACCEPTED STOICALLY 
NOTIFICATION OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF FUEL, EQUIPMENT AND USG 
CONTRACT PERSONNEL FROM BERBERA.  INITIALLY UPSET 
ABOUT THE EVACUATION OF USG PERSONNEL AND DEPENDENTS 
FROM MOGADISHU, HE CONCEDED THAT WE HAD THE RIGHT TO 
TAKE WHAT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WE FELT APPROPRIATE. 
ASKED WHAT GAMEPLAN HIS GOVERNMENT HAD FOR POLITICAL 
RECONCILIATION FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE 
CAIRO CONFERENCE, HE COULD NOT IDENTIFY ONE.  THE 
PRIME MINISTER DID PLEA FOR FOOD AID AND REQUESTED OUR 
INTERCESSION WITH THE IBRD.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  INTRODUCTION:  CALLED DECEMBER 22, 1990 ON PRIME 
MINISTER MOHAMED HAWADLE MADAR TO OFFICIALLY NOTIFY 
THE GSDR OF THE SUSPENSION OF OUR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF PERSONNEL, FUEL AND EQUIPMENT 
FROM BERBERA.  I INFORMED THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF OUR VOLUNTARY DEPARTURE STATUS 
DECEMBER 8.  BUT I SUBSEQUENTLY DELAYED TELLING THE 
GSDR WE HAD MOVED TO AN ORDERED DEPARTURE, AND OF THE 
CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, UNTIL OUR 
FILIPINO CONTRACTORS LEFT THE COUNTRY.  I WAS AFRAID 
THE GSDR MIGHT COMPEL THEM TO REMAIN, IN ORDER TO KEEP 
ITS PEACE CUBE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK FUNCTION- 
ING.  MADAR MET ME WITHOUT A NOTETAKER OR OTHER AIDE. 
I WAS UNACCOMPANIED. 
 
- 
4.  EVACUATION:  INITIATING THE DISCUSSION, I 
EXPLAINED THAT THE CONTINUED DETERIORATION OF 
THE SECURITY SITUATION HAD LED TO A USG DECISION 
TO WITHDRAW ALL AMERICAN GOVERNMENT DEPENDENTS AND 
NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL FROM SOMALIA.  UNFORTUNATELY, 
THIS STEP WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY TO SUSPEND OUR CIVIL 
AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.  THESE WOULD RESUME 
WHEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN SECURITY CONDITIONS PERMITTED 
THE RETURN OF THE PERSONNEL NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THEM. 
THE FUEL AND EQUIPMENT STORED AT BERBERA ARE NEEDED 
BY U.S. FORCES IN THE GULF, I TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER. 
THESE COMMODITIES, AND THE AMERICAN AND FILIPINO 
CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO BERBERA, WOULD BE REMOVED 
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, I EXPLAINED. 
 
- 
5.  RESPONDING FIRST ON THE SUBJECT OF EQUIPMENT IN 
BERBERA, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID SIMPLY, \"IT BELONGS 
TO YOU.  IF YOU NEED IT ELSEWHERE, TAKE IT.\"  ON THE WITH- 
DRAWAL OF USG DEPENDENTS AND STAFF FROM MOGADISHU, MADAR 
FIRST REGISTERED UNHAPPINESS AT THE \"UNILATERAL\" AMERICAN 
DECISION.  BUT AS WE TALKED IT THROUGH, AND I REMINDED 
HIM HOW OFTEN I HAD TOLD SENIOR GSDR OFFICIALS THAT OUR 
PERSONNEL WOULD BE REDUCED IF THE SECURITY PICTURE 
BECAME BLEAKER, THE PRIME MINISTER BACKED DOWN.  HE 
FINALLY STATED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD MY FIRST CONCERN HAD 
TO BE THE WELFARE OF MY COLLEAGUES.  HE THEN ADMITTED 
HIS BASIC CONCERN WAS THAT THE REGIME\'S OPPONENTS HAVE 
BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE PARTIAL EVACUATION OF THE 
DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS NO NEED 
TO NEGOTIATE WITH HIS GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE IT IS ON ITS 
LAST LEGS.  I ASSURED MADAR THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING 
TO DISCOURAGE SUCH UNFOUNDED CONCLUSIONS BY TELLING THE 
OPPOSITION IT SHOULD TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE 
THE REGIME HAS CONSIDERABLE STAYING POWER. 
 
- 
6.  RECONCILIATION:  EXPRESSING REGRET AT THE 
COLLAPSE OF THE CAIRO CONFERENCE, I ASKED THE 
PRIME MINISTER TO OUTLINE THE GSDR\'S NEXT STEPS 
TOWARD A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF ITS DIFFERENCES 
WITH ITS OPPONENTS.  IN RESPONSE, AN EXTREMELY 
DEFENSIVE MADAR SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
ARREST OF THE MANIFESTO GROUP MEMBERS, INSISTING THAT 
THE GSDR SHOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE POSTPONE- 
MENT OF THE CONFERENCE BECAUSE IT HAD ARRESTED TWO 
MEN GUILTY OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.  RATHER THAN ENGAGE 
IN FRUITLESS DEBATE ON THAT ISSUE, I AGAIN ASKED THE 
PRIME MINISTER TO OUTLINE WHAT STEPS THE GSDR NEXT 
INTENDS TO TAKE TO REACH A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT WITH 
ITS OPPONENTS.  MADAR STATED THAT THE GSDR STANDS 
READY TO GO TO CAIRO OR TO MEET IN MOGADISHU WITH 
ANYONE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COUNTRY\'S FUTURE.  IT ALSO 
MIGHT TRY TO HOST A CONFERENCE OF TRADITIONAL LEADERS, 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND INTELLECTUALS IN MOGADISHU, 
HE SAID.  HOWEVER, MADAR HAD NO STRATEGY TO DESCRIBE. 
IN FACT, HE ASKED ME TO SUGGEST ONE TO HIM.  HE PROVED 
UNFAMILIAR WITH HICKS\' SPEECH ON FEDERALISM AND 
SKEPTICAL OF ITS THESIS WHEN I DESCRIBED IT. 
 
- 
7.  FOOD AID:  LABELING HIS GOVERNMENT AS THE FIRST 
CIVILIAN REGIME IN 21 YEARS, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID 
HE WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT HIS PROVISIONAL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSTITUTION, UNDERTAKEN AT 
THE URGING OF WESTERN EMBASSIES, HAD NOT TRIGGERED THE 
RESUMPTION OF WESTERN ASSISTANCE HE EXPECTED.  THE 
WEST RISKS SEEING ANOTHER MILITARY REGIME IN SOMALIA 
HE INSISTED.  MADAR THEN TOOK ME TO TASK FOR THE 
ALLEGED REFUSAL OF THE USG TO PROVIDE FOOD AID TO 
SOMALIA, AT A TIME WHEN IT IS FURNISHING HOSTILE 
REGIMES IN ETHIOPIA AND MOZAMBIQUE WITH MASSIVE FOOD 
ASSISTANCE.  MADAR LISTENED PATIENTLY AS I EXPLAINED 
THE APOLITICAL NATURE OF USG EMERGENCY RELIEF PROGRAMS, 
INFORMED HIM THAT USG COMMODITIES ARE BEING DELIVERED 
TO THE ICRC AT BERBERA FOR USE IN THE NORTH, AND GAVE 
HIM A STATUS REPORT ON OUR PROPOSAL FOR 5 MILLION USDOLS 
IN EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR THE MOGADISHU AREA. 
 
- 
8.  PETROLEUM SHORTAGE:  BEFORE I COULD LEAVE, THE 
PRIME MINISTER ASKED THAT THE USG INTERCEDE WITH THE 
IBRD TO OBTAIN RELEASE OF THE THIRD TRANCHE 
OF THE AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM.  HE 
EXPLAINED THAT  THE GSDR WAS COUNTING ON IT TO FINANCE 
PETROLEUM IMPORTS FOR WHICH IT HAS NO OTHER FUNDS.  AS 
JUSTIFICATION, HE MENTIONED SEVERAL REFORMS THE GSDR 
HAS TAKEN SINCE THE RECENT DEPARTURE OF THE IBRD 
AGRICULTURAL TEAM.  IN RESPONDING TO MADAR, I GAVE 
HIM NO BASIS FOR ENCOURAGEMENT. 
 
- 
9.  COMMENT:  THE PRIME MINISTER\'S INABILITY TO 
IDENTIFY A STRATEGY FOR POLITICAL RECONCILIATION 
REFLECTS MORE, I SUSPECT, THE NEAR PARALYSIS 
AFFLICTING SIAD BARRE\'S GOVERNMENT THAN ANY 
WIDESPREAD BELIEF THAT GENERAL MORGAN\'S ONGOING 
MILITARY CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO CHECKMATE THE REGIME\'S 
ARMED  OPPONENTS.  MADAR\'S DEFENSIVENESS AND LACK OF 
A POLITICAL GAMEPLAN WERE ECHOED AT LUNCH DECEMBER 23 
BY REGIME LOYALIST BASHIR FARAH KAHIE, MADAR\'S 
MINISTER OF COMMERCE.

E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, SO 
SUBJ: DECEMBER 27, 1990 MEETING WITH PRESIDENT SIAD BARRE 
 
1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
- 
2. SUMMARY:  THE PRESIDENT POSED NO OBJECIION TO THE 
ORDERED DEPARTURE OF OUR PERSONNEL, NOR/OF THE WITHDRAWAL 
OF FUEL, EQUIPMENT AND CONTRACT PERSONNEL FROM BERBERA. 
HE SAID HE FEARED I HAD COME TO SAY ALL AMERICANS WERE 
LEAVING.  HIS COMMENTS ON THE COUNTRY\'S SITUATION WERE 
TERSE BUT REALISTIC.  HE EXPRESSED DETERMINATION TO CARRY 
ON BUT GAVE NO HINT OF ANY GAMEPLAN AND LAPSED ONCE 
INTO FATALISM.  HE SEEMED TO BE IN GOOD PHYSICAL AND 
MENTAL HEALTH BUT NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN EXTENDED 
DISCUSSION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
- 
3.  PRESIDENT SIAD BARRE RECEIVED ME AT MY REQUEST 
DECEMBER 27, 1990.  MY OBJECTIVE IN SEEKING THE MEETING, 
THE FIRST SINCE I PRESENTED MY CREDENTIALS IN SEPTEMBER, 
WAS TO MAKE A PERSONAL ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF MIND 
OF A CHIEF OF STATE WHOM ONE NEVER SEES IN PUBLIC AND 
ONLY IN THE MOST FORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES ON TELEVISION. 
WE MET AT VILLA SOMALIA IN A BUILDING AND ROOM ONCE 
USED BY THE CABINET FOR ITS SESSIONS.  SIAD ARRIVED 
AFTER I DID AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY VICE MINISTER 
BASI FROM THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND ANOTHER UNIDENTIFIED 
AIDE.  I WAS ALONE. 
 
- 
4.  LEFT TO INITIATE THE DISCUSSION, I TOLD SIAD I HAD 
ASKED TO SEE HIM BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN NO OCCASION 
TO SPEAK FOR THREE MONTHS AND BECAUSE I WANTED TO BRIEF 
HIM ON RECENT USG DECISIONS REGARDING SOMALIA, TO AVOID 
THE DANGER OF MISINTERPRETATION.  AS THE PRESIDENT 
NODDED, I EXPLAINED THAT OUR RECENT EVACUATION OF 
NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL HAD MADE IT NECESSARY TO 
SUSPEND OUR CIVIL AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, WHICH 
WE WOULD RESUME ONCE SECURITY CONDITIONS MADE IT 
POSSIBLE.  AS SIAD OFFERED NO COMMENT, I THEN TOLD HIM 
WE WERE WITHDRAWING FUEL, EQUIPMENT AND USG CONTRACT 
PERSONNEL FROM BERBERA, DUE TO PERSIAN GULF REQUIREMENTS. 
 
- 
5.  SIAD\'S RESPONSE, WHEN I FINISHED MY BRIEF PRESENTA- 
TION, WAS THE APPARENTLY SERIOUS COMMENT. \"O GOOD, I 
THOUGH YOU WERE COMING TO SAY GOODBYE AND TO TELL ME 
THE OTHER AMERICANS ALSO WERE LEAVING\".  CONTINUING, 
HE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED THE DECISIONS I HAD 
DESCRIBED.  DESCRIBING THE CURRENT SITUATION IN 
THE COUNTRY AS \"BAD\", THE PRESIDENT ADDED, \"AND I AM 
A LITTLE BIT OLD\".  HE CONCLUDED HIS RESPONSE WITH THE 
COMMENT, \"AND WE DON\'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN\". 
 
- 
6.  FOR THE NEXT TEN MINUTES I TRIED TO DRAW THE 
ELDERLY PRESIDENT INTO CONVERSATION BUT COULD ELICIT 
ONLY BRIEF RESPONSES TO THE SUBJECTS I RAISED.  HE 
WAS ANXIOUS TO TERMINATE THE MEETING AND PROBABLY WOULD 
HAVE DONE SO, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THE JUICE HE HAD 
OFFERED HAD NOT YET ARRIVED.  WHEN I MENTIONED USG 
DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE COLLAPSE OF THE CAIRO ROUNDTABLE 
AND ASKED IF SOME OTHER INITIATIVE WERE UNDERWAY, 
SIAD REPLIED, \"THEY CAN COME HERE AND TALK IF THEY 
WANT TO\".  ASKED IF HE WAS LOOKING FOR ANY FURTHER HELP 
FROM THE USG OR OTHER NATIONS IN PROMOTING PEACEFUL 
RECONCILIATION, HIS COMMENT WAS THAT \"GOD HELPS THOSE 
WHO HELP THEMSELVES\".  WHEN I NOTED THE PASSAGE OF 
THE LEGISLATION ESTABLISHING GROUNDRULES FOR THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF POLITICAL PARTIES, HE SAID HE THOUGHT 
ONE OR TWO ALREADY HAD REGISTERED.  THEN HE HAD AN 
APPARENTLY INCONCLUSIVE EXCHANGE IN SOMALI WITH HIS 
AIDES ON THE SUBJECT.  HE REPEATED AGAIN THAT THE 
SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY WAS BAD, NOTING AT ONE POINT THAT 
WHAT HAPPENS IS \"UP TO GOD\". 
 
7. AFTER OUR JUICE ARRIVED, AND APPARENTLY JUST TO MAKE 
CONVERSATION, SIAD SAID HE UNDERSTOOD PRESIDENT BUSH TOO 
WAS IN TROUBLE.  WHEN I ASKED HIM TO ELABORATE, HE 
ASKED INSTEAD WHEN THE PRESIDENT WILL LAUNCH THE ATTACK 
ON IRAQ.  WITH A SMILE I TOLD HIM THAT THE DATE HAD NOT 
BEEN SHARED WITH THE EMBASSY.  WE THEN EXCHANGED NEW 
YEARS GREETINGS AND PARTED. 
 
- 
8.  COMMENT:  SIAD\'S STRIDE WAS VIGOROUS FOR A MAN IN 
HIS EIGHTIES, HIS HANDSHAKE WAS FIRM, AND HIS MIND 
WAS ALERT.  HAVING HAD TO LISTEN THE PREVIOUS DAY TO 
THE SOMALI AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON INSIST FOR AN HOUR 
THAT THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY IS IN ALL IMPORTANT 
RESPECTS NORMAL, AND HAVING BEEN TOLD BY ADMIRAL MARINO 
THAT PEACE HAD RETURNED TO THE NORTHWEST AS WE 
CHATTED WHILE I WAITED FOR SIAD, I WAS SURPRISED BY THE 
PRESLDENT\'S   REALISM IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE REGIME\'S 
PLIGHT.  HOWEVER, HE IS CONSIDERABLY SMARTER THAN MY 
OTHER TWO INTERLOCUTORS AND CERTAINLY WISE ENOUGH  TO 
REALIZE HE WOULD HAVE NO CREDIBILITY PRETENDING TO 
ANYONE LIVING IN MOGADISHU THAT CONDITIONS HERE 
RESEMBLE NORMALCY.  RECOGNIZING OUR PREOCCUPATION WITH 
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, HE PROBABLY ALSO SAW NO 
MILEAGE IN TOUTING THE REGIME\'S MILITARY AND POLICE 
INITIATIVES.  PERHAPS HE RECOGNIZES THEIR LIMITATIONS. 
MY GENERAL IMPRESSION WAS THAT I WAS DEALING WITH A 
WORRIED MAN WHO DOES NOT FEEL HE HAS A GAMEPLAN WHICH 
WILL ALLOW HIM TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS BEFORE HIM. 
NEVERTHELESS HE SEEMED INTENT TO MUDDLE ON, GIVING NO 
HINT THAT HE MIGHT BE THINKING OF HEADING TOWARD THE 
EXIT.
