COMMENTARY 
---------- 
 
9.  (C)  FATOS NANO WAS BORN INTO A FAMILY THAT 
WAS PART OF THE ELITE OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME. 
HIS FATHER WAS THE DIRECTOR OF STATE RADIO AND 
TELEVISION FOR MANY YEARS.  NANO HIMSELF GRADUATED FROM 
\"SAMI FRASHERI\" HIGH SCHOOL IN TIRANA, RESERVED 
FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE NOMENKLATURA.  HE LEARNED 
FOREIGN LANGUAGES AND TO PLAY THE GUITAR.  IN HIS 
SECOND YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL, HE FOUNDED A ROCK 
GROUP (HE WAS THE LEAD SINGER) THAT PLAYED THE 
MUSIC OF THE BEATLES, STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC AT THE TIME. 
 
10.  (C)  ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, WHEN NANO WAS 
WORKING IN THE MARXIST-LENINIST INSTITUTE, HE WAS 
SINGLED OUT BY HOXHA\'S WIFE, WHO HEADED THE 
INSTITUTE, FOR SPECIAL FAVOR.  SHE REPORTEDLY 
FOLLOWED HIS CAREER AND HELPED HIM AT STRATEGIC 
POINTS TO MOVE FROM JOB TO JOB. 
 
11.  (C)  HE WAS APPOINTED DEPUTY PM IN EARLY 
1991, AND AFTER THE FALL OF THE CARCANI GOVERNMENT 
BECAME PM.  AFTER FOUR WEEKS IN THIS POST, HE HAD 
TO PREPARE THE ELECTIONS OF MARCH 31.  HE RAN AND 
WON AS A CANDIDATE OF THE PARTY OF LABOR IN TIRANA 
IN THE RUN-OFF ROUND OF THIS ELECTION.  IN THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT HE WAS AGAIN APPOINTED PM.  THE NEW 
JOB, HOWEVER, DID NOT LAST LONGER THAN THE FIRST. 
ONE WEEK AFTER HIS INSTALLATION, THE GENERAL 
STRIKE ORGANIZED BY THE INDEPENDENT UNIONS BEGAN 
AND HE RESIGNED A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER.  YLLI 
BUFI TOOK OVER AS PRIME MINISTER TO HEAD AN 
EQUALLY SHORT-LIVED GOVERNMENT. 
 
12.  (C)  IN THE TENTH CONGRESS OF THE LABOR 
PARTY, IN JUNE, 1991, HE WON THE EMPTY SEAT OF THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY.  THE WRITER DRITERO AGOLLI 
WAS HIS MAIN RIVAL IN THAT CONTEST.  IN THE SAME 
CONGRESS, THE PARTY OF LABOR\'S NAME WAS CHANGED TO 
THE SOCIALIST PARTY OF ALBANIA. 
 
13.  (C)  FOR THE ELECTIONS OF MARCH, 1992, THE 
SOCIALIST PARTY WAS PREPARED TO FACE A MAJOR 
DEFEAT.  IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT NANO WAS 
ACCUSED OF COOKING UP A DEAL WITH BERISHA FOR 
SHIFTING POWER TO THE RIGHT, THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY 
DISCUSSED IN TRIESTE, ITALY, AT A CONFERENCE BOTH 
ATTENDED, IN THE PRESENCE OF MENTOR COKU.  IN THE 
THOSE ELECTIONS, NANO WON AS A CANDIDATE IN KUCOVA. 
HIS RIVAL FOR THAT SEAT WAS PERIKLI TETA, NOW STATE 
SECRETARY IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IN NANO\'S 
GOVERNMENT. 
 
14.  (C)  IN HIS LAST SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT BEFORE 
HIS ARREST, NANO ACCUSED FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR 
WILLIAM RYERSON, THEN DCM CHRIS HILL, AND THE CIA 
FOR HAVING PLOTTED WITH BERISHA TO SET UP HIS 
PHONEY TRIAL.  IN THE SAME SPEECH, NANO ACCUSED 
BERISHA OF TURNING ALBANIA INTO AN AMERICAN-RUN 
BANANA REPUBLIC. 
 
15.  (C)  IN 1996, THERE WERE RUMORS HIS DAUGHTER 
WAS TAKING DRUGS WHILE HE WAS IN PRISON AND THAT 
HIS TEENAGE SON HAD GOTTEN OUT OF HIS MOTHER\'S 
CONTROL, BECOMING REBELLIOUS AND UNRULY.  WITH 
BOTH OF HIS CHILDREN CURRENTLY STUDYING OUTSIDE OF 
ALBANIA, WHATEVER THE TRUTH OF THE RUMORS, THEY 
SEEM TO BE DOING WELL NOW AND RECENTLY JOINED 
THEIR PARENTS AT A DAY A DURRES BEACH WHERE 
FOREIGNERS WERE PRESENT. 
 
16.  (C)  NANO IS AN INTENSE, FOCUSSED INDIVIDUAL 
WHO, AT ABOUT 5\' 6\" IS AVERAGE HEIGHT FOR AN 
ALBANIAN MALE.  FORMERLY SLIM AND CLEANSHAVEN, HE 
EMERGED FROM PRISON WITH A SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT GAIN 
AND A BEARD.  MANY OLD ACQUAINTANCES SAID THEY DID 
NOT RECOGNIZE HIM AFTER HIS RELEASE.  A HEAVY 
SMOKER, A SOCIAL ANIMAL WHO ENJOYS LATE-NIGHT 
SCHMOOZING WITH HIS INNER CIRCLE OF POLITICAL 
FRIENDS, NANO IS SERIOUS EVEN WHEN HE IS JOKING. 
 
17.  (C)  HIS CLOSEST FRIEND WHO STUCK WITH HIM 
THROUGH THE WORST TIMES, WHEN HE WAS IN PRISON, IS 
BASHKIM ZENELI.  ZENELI, WHO BESIDES NANO\'S WIFE 
HAS BEEN HIS MOST INTIMATE CONFIDANT, HAS NOT BEEN 
GIVEN A PRESTIGIOUS HIGH-PROFILE POSITION. 
RATHER, AS MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT AND DEPUTY HEAD OF 
THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
HE KEEPS A FAIRLY LOW PROFILE. 
 
18.  (C)  NANO\'S WIFE VISITED HIM ONCE A WEEK IN 
TEPELENA PRISON.  THEY ARE VERY EVIDENTLY DEVOTED 
TO ONE ANOTHER AND WHILE SHE IS NOT AS PROFICIENT 
IN LANGUAGES AND DOES NOT SPEAK MUCH WHEN THEY ARE 
IN PUBLIC OR IN THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGNERS, IT 
SEEMS CLEAR THAT NANO HOLDS HER OPINION IN HIGH 
REGARD.

REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D).

PROFESSOR IN 1990. 
 
3.  (U)  PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:  BROKAJ WORKED 
AS AN ASSISTANT DOCTOR/MEDIC IN A SUBMARINE, 1959- 
1964.  HE WAS BRIGADE MEDICAL CHIEF IN SHIJAKU

JULY 1997. 
 
5.  (U)  LANGUAGES:  BROKAJ SPEAKS SOME ENGLISH,

COMMENTARY 
---------- 
 
6.  (C)  BROKAJ COMES ACROSS AS A KINDLY 
GENTLEMAN, ALTHOUGH HE IS REPUTED TO BE FORMER 
PRESIDENT SALI BERISHA\'S MOST DETERMINED ENEMY. 
BROKAJ IS ALSO FAMOUS AS BEING ANOTHER OF HOXHA\'S 
PERSONAL PHYSICIANS.  HE WORKED WITH BERISHA IN 
THE CARDIOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF THE TIRANA HOSPITAL 
WHERE A VICIOUS RIVALRY DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE TWO. 
WE ARE TOLD THEY ARE NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS. 
 
7.  (C)  AS DEFENSE MINISTER, BROKAJ HAS LEFT 
SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY 
NEEDS A STRONG MANAGEMENT HAND AT THE HELM, TO 
HELP QUICKLY REBUILD AND REINVIGORATE THE 
COUNTRY\'S ARMED FORCES WHICH COMPLETELY 
DISINTEGRATED IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR.  ALTHOUGH 
BROKAJ\'S LEADERSHIP MAY BE SUSPECT, HE SAYS THE 
RIGHT THINGS TO HIS FOREIGN VISITORS AND HAS 
SOUGHT FOREIGN ADVISORS FOR HIS OFFICE.  QUESTIONS 
ALSO REMAIN AS TO WHETHER HE TELLS VISITORS WHAT 
HE THINKS THEY WANT TO HEAR OR WHAT HE REALLY 
BELIEVES. 
 
8.  (C)  BROKAJ IS CONSIDERED A MEMBER OF THE \"OLD 
GUARD\" WITHIN THE SOCIALIST PARTY.  FOR THE RECENT 
ARMED FORCES DAY, OBSERVERS NOTED THE ELABORATE 
DISPLAYS OF SOLDIERS AND WEAPONS REMINISCENT OF 
THE COMMUNIST-ERA CELEBRATIONS WHICH HAD NOT BEEN 
SEEN SINCE THE BEFORE THE FALL OF COMMUNISM HERE.
