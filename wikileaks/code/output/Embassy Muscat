SUBJECT: BIN ALAWI ANGRY, FRUSTRATED BY U.S. \"BIAS\" TOWARDS 
ISRAEL, SAYS ARABS WILL REFUSE TO CONDEMN SUICIDE BOMBING; 
SAUDI PEACE PLAN \"ONLY WAY FORWARD\" 
 
REF: STATE 67796 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON CHIEF WILLIAM R. STEWART FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  OMANI MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS BIN ALAWI STRONGLY CRITICIZES U.S. POLICY IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST AND COMPLAINS THAT U.S. IS \"COMPLETELY BIASED\" 
TOWARDS ISRAEL.  BIN ALAWI SAYS THAT IT IS \"IMPOSSIBLE\" NOW 
FOR ARAB LEADERS TO CONDEMN SUICIDE BOMBING, WHICH THEY SEE 
NOT ONLY AS LEGITIMATE SELF-DEFENSE FOR THE PALESTINIANS BUT 
THE ONLY WAY THEY HAVE TO \"FIGHT BACK\" AGAINST \"ISRAELI 
ATROCITIES.\"  BIN ALAWI BLAMES THE U.S. FOR THE CURRENT 
DEPLORABLE SITUATION, SAYING THAT AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY 
FAVORS ONLY THE ISRAELIS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ARABS.  BIN 
ALAWI SAYS THAT THE SAUDI PEACE PROPOSAL ENDORSED AT THE 
BEIRUT ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT IS \"THE ONLY WAY FORWARD\" TOWARD 
PEACE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) THE CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES MET MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS YUSUF BIN ALAWI ON APRIL 10 TO DELIVER REFTEL 
TALKING POINTS (MFA ARABIAN AFFAIRS CHIEF AMBASSADOR AHMAD 
AL-HARTHI AND POL/E CHIEF ATTENDED AS NOTETAKERS).  AFTER 
GLANCING AT THE POINTS, BIN ALAWI SAID THAT \"THESE SIMPLY 
FOLLOW THE STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE IN THE 
MEDIA.\"  THE CHARGE SAID THAT THE POINTS GO BEYOND PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS.  THE UNITED STATES IS ASKING FOR THE HELP OF ARAB 
GOVERNMENTS TO PRESSURE ARAFAT TO DENOUNCE SUICIDE BOMBINGS 
AND TO RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS.  THE CHARGE EMPHASIZED THAT 
THE UNITED STATES IS SINCERE AND GENUINE IN ITS EFFORTS AND 
UNDERSCORED OUR COMMITMENT TO GETTING BOTH THE SECURITY AND 
POLITICAL PROCESSES BACK ON TRACK.  THE CHARGE NOTED THAT 
GENERAL ZINNI HAD MET WITH YASER ARAFAT AND WAS LAYING THE 
GROUNDWORK FOR BEGINNING A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE. THE FOCUS 
NOW, SAID THE CHARGE, IS ON SECRETARY POWELL\'S VISIT TO 
JERUSALEM BEGINNING TOMORROW. 
 
3.  (C) BIN ALAWI SAID THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THESE POINTS, WHICH 
HAD BEEN MADE BEFORE. \"BUT THEY ARE ONLY WISHES.\"  WE BELIEVE 
THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS \"LOST ITS DIRECTION.\"  THE UNITED 
STATES PUTS \"ALL THE BLAME\" ON ARAFAT.  HE IS THE ONLY ONE TO 
BE BLAMED, NO MATTER WHAT THE REALITY.  THE UNITED STATES HAS 
BEEN MAKING MISTAKES ALL ALONG AND NOW IS MAKING \"AN EVEN 
BIGGER MISTAKE.\"  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS TIME FOR THE 
UNITED STATES, SAID BIN ALAWI.  YOU ASK ARAB LEADERS TO 
CONDEMN HAMAS AND OTHER GROUPS FOR VIOLENCE. \"BUT THIS WILL 
NOT HAPPEN.\"  INSTEAD, HE SAID, ALL YOU WILL GET ARE \"FURTHER 
CONFRONTATIONS\" WITH ARAB LEADERS. 
 
4. (C) THE CHARGE PUSHED BACK, REITERATING THE U.S. DESIRE 
FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 
1402.  WE NEED TO GET THE ELEMENTS OF A POLITICAL PROCESS 
UNDERWAY ONCE AGAIN, SAID THE CHARGE.  GENERAL ZINNI HAS 
ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED MUCH BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES, AND WHEN 
SECRETARY POWELL COMES HE WILL ENCOURAGE BOTH SIDES TO 
DECLARE A CEASEFIRE AND THEN MOVE IMMEDIATELY TO BEGIN A 
POLITICAL PROCESS.  THE KEY, SAID THE CHARGE, IS FOR FRIENDLY 
ARAB GOVERNMENTS TO REINFORCE OUR MESSAGE TO THE PALESTINIAN 
AUTHORITY AND TO ASK ARAFAT TO SUPPORT THE CEASEFIRE AND 
ISSUE A STRONG STATEMENT AGAINST TERRORISM. 
 
5.  (C) SHAKING HIS HEAD, BIN ALAWI SAID \"YOU ARE CRACKING 
ALL YOUR RESOURCES IN THE ARAB WORLD.\"  THE ISRAELIS ARE 
\"DESTROYING EVERYTHING,\" AND YOU WANT ARAB LEADERS TO ISSUE 
STATEMENTS \"AGAINST HAMAS, AGAINST PALESTINIANS.\" \"IS THIS 
LOGICAL?\"  YOU HAVE LOST DIRECTION, REPEATED BIN ALAWI. 
REMEMBER, SAID BIN ALAWI, THE MITCHELL REPORT WAS YOUR 
PROPOSAL.  THE PALESTINIANS AGREED.  THE PALESTINIANS ARE 
WILLING TO IMPLEMENT IT.  THEN CAME TENET.  AGAIN THE 
PALESTINIANS AGREED.  BUT INSTEAD OF IMPLEMENTING IT, YOU 
(THE U.S.) \"SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING BECAUSE THE ISRAELIS 
WON\'T ACCEPT IT.\"  INSTEAD, YOU SENT ZINNI TO THE REGION TO 
DESIGN \"YET ANOTHER PROCESS.\"  ONLY THIS TIME, THE PROCESS IS 
TAILORED TO MEET ONLY ISRAEL\'S DESIRES. BUT NOW, THE 
PALESTINIANS WON\'T AGREE TO IT, BECAUSE \"IT IS NOT FAIR.\" 
\"WE KNOW THAT ISRAEL REFUSED 14 POINTS IN THE TENET PLAN. 
YOU AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE THE DIGNITY TO FIGHT FOR YOUR 
PROPOSAL.  AFTER ALL, YOU PUT IT FORWARD.  BUT INSTEAD, YOU 
CHOOSE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE POOR PALESTINIANS.\" 
 
6.  (C) THE CHARGE REPLIED BY NOTING THAT MISTAKES HAVE BEEN 
MADE BY BOTH SIDES.  NO, INTERJECTED BIN ALAWI, \"NOT BY BOTH 
SIDES.\"  THE ISRAELIS AND THE ISRAELIS ALONE HAVE REJECTED 
ALL THE PROPOSALS THE U.S. HAS PUT FORWARD, HE SAID.  THEY 
HAVE BEEN THE STUMBLING BLOCK, NOT THE PALESTINIANS.  THE 
CHARGE SAID THAT THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED, AND NOW THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS INSISTED ON THE IMMEDIATE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1402.  WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT 
MAKE, REJOINED BIN ALAWI.  ISRAEL REFUSES TO IMPLEMENT 1402. 
HOW CAN THE U.S. DEFEND ISRAEL FOR ITS WRONGDOING?  YOU HAVE 
NOW CREATED A SITUATION, CONTINUED BIN ALAWI, WHERE \"THERE IS 
NO HAMAS, THERE IS ONLY THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.\"  \"YOU ARE 
GOING DOWNHILL.\"  I AM SPEAKING TO YOU FRANKLY, SAID BIN 
ALAWI.  I AM GIVING YOU ADVICE AS A FRIEND MUST.  WE FEEL 
SORRY FOR OUR FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON. UNFORTUNATELY, ALL YOU 
HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DOING IS TO PUT EVERYONE IN THE REGION IN 
\"A VERY AWKWARD POSITION.\" 
 
7.  (C)  THE CHARGE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO DRAW 
THE LINE AT SUICIDE BOMBINGS.  THE U.S. NEEDED THE SUPPORT OF 
ITS ARAB FRIENDS TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE PALESTINIANS TO ISSUE 
A CLEAR CONDEMNATION OF SUICIDE BOMBINGS OF INNOCENT 
ISRAELIS.  \"THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN,\" SAID BIN ALAWI. 
YOU CANNOT ASK ARAB LEADERS TO CONDEMN PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE 
WHEN THEY HAVE \"NO OTHER WAY TO FIGHT BACK.\"  \"WHY DO YOU 
ONLY CONDEMN THE PALESTINIAN?\" CONTINUED BIN ALAWI.  WHY DO 
YOU NOT CONDEMN ISRAELI ATROCITIES?  WE BLAME THE U.S. FOR 
NOT HAVING PUT OBSERVERS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  THE 
PALESTINIANS NEED PROTECTION JUST AS MUCH AS ISRAELIS DO. 
THE ARABS HAVE ASKED REPEATEDLY FOR U.S. OBSERVERS, BUT THERE 
HAS BEEN \"NO RESPONSE\" FROM THE U.S.  WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT 
THE US WANTS ONLY FOR THE PALESTINIANS \"TO SURRENDER TO 
ISRAEL.\"  \"THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.\"  THE ISRAELIS WANT 
THE RIGHT TO INVADE THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AT ANY TIME, AND 
ARREST ANYONE THEY WANT FOR ANY REASON. \"IS THIS FAIR?\" 
 
8. (C) THE CHARGE REPEATED THAT THE U.S. HAS ASKED ISRAEL TO 
WITHDRAW FROM THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES.  YES, SAID BIN 
ALAWI, AND THAT IS A GOOD THING.  BUT YOU STILL DO NOT 
CONDEMN ISRAELI AGGRESSION. YOU ONLY CONDEMN THE 
PALESTINIANS.  YOU AMERICANS CANNOT AVOID BLAME FOR THE 
CURRENT SITUATION,.  YOU TOOK THE RESPONSIBILITY FROM 1993 -- 
YOU PUSHED THE MADRID PROCESS FORWARD.  YOU SOUGHT AND 
OBTAINED THE SUPPORT OF THE ARABS.  AND YET NOW YOU ONLY TAKE 
ONE SIDE.  THIS WAS NOT THE CASE UNDER THE PREVIOUS TWO 
ADMINISTRATIONS -- THEN YOU WERE \"BASICALLY FAIR.\"  BUT THE 
POLICIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE LED TO THE CURRENT 
SITUATION.  \"THERE IS NO PEACE PROCESS.\" 
 
9. (C)  THE CHARGE STRESSED THAT THE U.S. IS GENUINELY 
COMMITTED TO TRYING TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR A CEASEFIRE TO 
TAKE HOLD, FOLLOWED BY A POLITICAL PROCESS AND PEACE 
NEGOTIATIONS.  IN ORDER TO DO THIS, THE U.S. SEEKS THE 
ASSISTANCE OF THE ARABS TO PRESSURE THE PALESTINIANS TO DO 
WHATEVER THEY CAN TO PREVENT FUTURE SUICIDE BOMBINGS.  FINE, 
RESPONDED BIN ALAWI.  BUT WHAT WILL THE U.S. DO IN RETURN? 
\"WHAT WILL YOU DO TO THE ISRAELIS?  THEY DESTROY EVERYTHING. 
THEY ARE THE AGGRESSORS.  THE WHOLE WORLD CAN SEE THE 
ISRAELIS DESTROYING MOSQUES AND CHURCHES AND HOSPITALS AND 
SCHOOLS.  WHAT WILL THE UNITED STATES DO TO THEM?\"  THE 
CHARGE RESPONDED THAT THE U.S. HAS STRONGLY URGED THE 
ISRAELIS TO WITHDRAW THEIR FORCES FROM THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES BACK TO ISRAEL PROPER, AND TO REMAIN THERE.  BUT 
THIS WILL ONLY BE EFFECTIVE -- AND ONLY LAST -- IF THE 
PALESTINIANS CAN STOP FUTURE SUICIDE BOMBINGS. 
 
10. (C) BIN ALAWI SAID THAT THE KEY TO RESOLVING THE CRISIS 
IS NOT MILITARY OR SECURITY -- THE ANSWER IS TO RETURN TO A 
POLITICAL PROCESS.  THE SAUDI PROPOSAL, ADOPTED BY THE ARAB 
LEAGUE AT THE RECENT BEIRUT SUMMIT, IS \"VERY CLEAR\" AND \"THE 
ONLY WAY TO STOP THE VIOLENCE.\"  THE FIRST STEP, SAID BIN 
ALAWI, IS FOR ISRAELI FORCES TO PULL BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE 
\"ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2000.\"  ANY OTHER WORDS OR ACTIONS WILL 
\"NOT BE HELPFUL.\"  AND THE LOSERS, ACCORDING TO BIN ALAWI, 
WILL BE \"THE POOR PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.\"  THE CHARGE SAID THAT 
THE U.S. BELIEVES IN AND IS NOW THOROUGHLY ENGAGED IN A 
POLITICAL DISCUSSION WITH ALL THE PARTIES.  BIN ALAWI ASKED, 
\"THEN WHY DON\'T YOU ENFORCE THE AGREEMENTS AND DECISIONS 
WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE?\"  WE HAVE HEARD WORDS AND 
STATEMENTS BEFORE, CONTINUED BIN ALAWI.  \"WE HAVE HEARD YOU 
SAY \'WE WANT THIS\' AND \'WE HOPE THAT.\'\"  WHAT IS NEEDED NOW, 
HE ADDED, ARE NOT WANTS, HOPES, OR WISHES BUT \"ACTION.\"  \"IF 
YOU ARE SERIOUS, YOU CAN FORCE THE ISRAELIS TO WITHDRAW.\"  IT 
HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST.  BUT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IF IT IS 
ONLY A \"MATTER OF CONVENIENCE.\" BEFORE THE ARABS CAN BE 
\"TOUGH ON THE PALESTINIANS,\" BIN ALAWI INSISTED, WE MUST 
FIRST SEE YOU BE \"TOUGH ON YOUR FRIENDS, THE ISRAELIS.\" 
 
11. (C) BIN ALAWI WARNED THAT THE U.S. WAS \"MAKING A VERY 
DANGEROUS MISTAKE\" IN APPROACHING ARAB LEADERS TO PRESSURE 
THE PALESTINIANS.  \"THIS WILL ONLY LEAD TO CONFRONTATION WITH 
THE ARABS,\" SAID BIN ALAWI, \"WHICH NO ONE WANTS.\"  BY ASKING 
ARABS AND PALESTINIANS TO CONDEMN HAMAS AND ISLAMIC JIHAD, 
YOU ARE IN FACT ASKING THEM TO CONDEMN THE RIGHT OF 
PALESTINIANS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.  THE CHARGE SAID THAT THE 
U.S. INSISTS THAT ALL ACTIONS BY ANY PARTY MUST BE PEACEFUL. 
THEN WHY DO YOU NOT CONDEMN THE ISRAELIS FOR USING F-16\'S, 
APACHE HELICOPTERS, AND TANKS TO ATTACK INNOCENT PALESTINIAN 
CIVILIANS, ASKED BIN ALAWI.  SINCE THE UNITED STATES, THE 
WORLD\'S ONLY SUPERPOWER, WON\'T PROTECT THE PALESTINIANS, 
SUICIDE BOMBING IS THE ONLY WAY LEFT OPEN TO THEM FOR 
SELF-DEFENSE.  SUICIDE BOMBING HAS ENGENDERED MUCH DISMAY AND 
HORROR AND RESULTED IN VERY NEGATIVE IMAGE IN THE U.S., THE 
CHARGE STRESSED.  \"F-16\'S AND APACHES HAVE RESULTED IN A VERY 
NEGATIVE IMAGE IN THE ARAB WORLD,\" BIN ALAWI SHOT BACK. 
 
12. (C) WE DO NOT WANT TO DESTROY ISRAEL, BIN ALAWI SAID. 
OMAN HAS FOR MANY YEARS BEEN AN ACTIVE PLAYER IN THE PEACE 
PROCESS.  WE HAVE HAD GOOD RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL.  WE HAVE 
INVESTED HEAVILY IN ISRAEL FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS.  WE 
WANT ISRAEL TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY WITH ITS NEIGHBORS. 
 NO ONE IS ASKING ISRAEL TO COMPROMISE ITS SECURITY.  BUT WE 
WANT THE SAME FOR THE PALESTINIANS.  AND MORE AND MORE ARABS 
ARE BECOMING CONVINCED THAT ISRAEL DOES NOT SEEK PEACE AND 
SECURITY BUT RATHER \"PEACE AND TERRITORY.\"  \"AFTER 11 YEARS 
OF A FAILED PEACE PROCESS, ISRAEL NOW WANTS ARAFAT GIVE UP 
PALESTINIAN TERRITORY.  HE WILL NEVER DO THAT.\"  THE U.S. HAS 
ENTERED VERY DANGEROUS TERRITORY, WARNED BIN ALAWI AGAIN. 
\"DON\'T PUSH THE ARABS TO THE WALL.\" 
 
13. (C) IT IS NOT ONLY THE PALESTINIANS WHO SUFFER FROM THIS, 
CONTINUED BIN ALAWI.  WE ALL DO.  \"TELL SECRETARY POWELL THAT 
EVERY DAY WE (THE OMANI GOVERNMENT) FACE HUMILIATION FROM THE 
STREET\" BECAUSE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP WITH THE U.S.  NEVER MIND 
ABOUT THE WAR ON TERRORISM OR EVENTS IN AFGHANISTAN OR IRAQ, 
BIN ALAWI SAID.  THE UNITED STATES HAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM -- 
THE MIDDLE EAST.  \"WE\'VE BEEN DEALING WITH U.S. FOREIGN 
POLICY FOR TWENTY YEARS,\" BIN ALAWI CONCLUDED.  \"THE ONE 
THING WE HAVE LEARNED IS THIS:  YOU ONLY GET ATTENTION IF YOU 
SHOUT.  OTHERWISE, YOU ARE NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY.\"  CONSIDER ME 
TO BE SHOUTING. 
 
14. (C) COMMENT:  WHILE THE MEETING WAS PERFECTLY CORDIAL, 
BIN ALAWI WAS IN LITTLE MOOD TO LISTEN.  HE HAD ORIGINALLY 
GRANTED ONLY FIFTEEN MINUTES WHEN WE REQUESTED THE 
APPOINTMENT; THE DISCUSSION ENDED UP TAKING OVER AN HOUR. 
HIS FRUSTRATION REFLECTS SENTIMENTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL 
LEVELS OF OMANI SOCIETY:  WE WANT ACTION, NOT WORDS.  U.S. 
CREDIBILITY IN OMAN HAS BEEN GREATLY DIMINISHED; OMANIS ARE 
CONVINCED THAT WE HAVE COMPLETELY SOLD OUT TO ISRAEL NO 
MATTER WHAT WE SAY.  THE PRESS, INTERNET CHAT ROOMS, AND OUR 
INTERLOCUTORS ALL POINT TO THE LENGTH OF TIME IT IS TAKING 
FOR THE SECRETARY TO REACH ISRAEL; THIS IS SEEN AS A CLEAR 
DELAYING TACTIC TO ALLOW THE ISRAELIS TIME TO FINISH THEIR 
OPERATIONS.  BIN ALAWI\'S ALLEGATIONS THAT GENERAL ZINNI IS 
NOT NEUTRAL BUT IS REPRESENTING THE ISRAELIS MORE THAN THE 
U.S. IS ALSO A UBIQUITOUS BELIEF HERE.  WHEN WE ARRIVED FOR 
THE MEETING, BIN ALAWI HAD A LARGE SCREEN TELEVISION ON HIS 
OFFICE TUNED TO ABU DHABI TV BEAMING GRIM IMAGES FROM THE 
WEST BANK/GAZA.  THE VOLUME WAS SO LOUD, HE HAD TO INTERRUPT 
THE MEETING TO TURN IT OFF.  IT IS LIKELY HE TURNED IT BACK 
ON AS SOON AS WE LEFT -- AND THAT MOST OMANIS ARE WATCHING 
THE SAME THING.  IT IS UNLIKELY ANYTHING WILL BREAK THROUGH 
THEIR ABSORPTION WITH THE VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND 
THEIR ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THE U.S. AND ISRAEL SHORT OF AN 
ISRAELI PULLOUT AND AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO A POLITICAL 
DIALOGUE, OFFERING AT LEAST A GLIMMER OF HOPE AT THE END OF A 
VERY DARK TUNNEL.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (S) The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core Emergency 
Action Committee (\"EAC\") on November 3 to reassess the 
Embassy\'s security posture prior to the local weekend, to 
discuss any security implications following the death of 
United Arab Emirates (UAE) President Sheikh Zayid bin Sultan 
al-Nahyan, and to re-evaluate the Embassy\'s Force Protection 
Condition in the wake of United States Defense Representative 
(USDR) Doha, Qatar\'s recent elevation from Bravo to Charlie 
(reftel B). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Response to the Death of UAE President Sheikh Zayed 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (SBU) The EAC reviewed the passing of Sheikh Zayed and 
possible security implications in Oman.  The EAC determined 
that Zayid\'s death has little to no/no security implications 
for the Embassy. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Re-evaluation of Embassy\'s FPCON 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (S/NF) The EAC re-assessed the Embassy\'s FPCON following 
USDR Doha\'s recent increase from Bravo to Charlie (reftel B). 
 The EAC concluded that Doha\'s actions are based on the 
recent threat reporting specific to Qatar and are not/not 
applicable to Oman.  The EAC concluded that there has been no 
change in the local security environment since the last 
meeting held on October 31 (reftel A), and that the Embassy\'s 
FPCON (Bravo) and already heightened security posture remain 
appropriate.  Likewise, members of the EAC cited no security 
incidents among their staffs or dependents during the week. 
CONS confirmed that there were no security incidents or 
related queries from the private American citizen community. 
RSO and RMAS affirmed that their Omani government 
counterparts continue to emphasize that they have control of 
the local security situation and are poised to respond to any 
imminent threat to American personnel or interests in Oman. 
 
------------------ 
Remaining Vigilant 
------------------ 
 
4. (S/NF) Prior to concluding the meeting, RSO reiterated 
that members of the EAC should continue reinforcing to both 
their staffs and family members the need for vigilance 
regarding all aspects of personal security, including the 
need to maintain a low profile and to remain unpredictable. 
RSO also re-emphasized the importance of immediately 
reporting suspicious activity or security-related incidents, 
especially those involving suspected surveillance, to Post 
One.  The EAC remains acutely aware of the need to monitor 
both the regional and local security environments, and is 
prepared to take the necessary countermeasures should changes 
to either occur.  AMB, DCM, A/RSO, RMAS, CONS, OMC (USDR), 
and ECA (USCENTAF) participated in the meeting.

1. (SBU) Summary: A long-expected pullout by British Airports 
Authority from the privatized consortium managing Oman\'s 
international airports means that the government will now run 
the airports in Muscat and Salalah.  One of the alleged key 
sticking points was the failure of the government and the 
private consortium to agree on the financial terms for 
constructing a new passenger terminal in Muscat.  Originally 
slated for completion by 2007, the new terminal likely will 
now be erected on a longer timetable under government 
control.  A new 100 percent Omani government-owned company 
will be formed to assume control of the airports; the 
government has agreed to buy out the shares held by the 
private consortium. Most staff will be retained by the new 
company, including administrators and consultants from the 
previous consortium who will be invited to stay on for the 
first six months during a transition phase.  End Summary. 
 
------------- 
Rough Landing 
------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Airport management had long been viewed as an area 
where privatization could proceed in modernizing Oman\'s 
transport infrastructure and achieving key efficiencies in a 
growing regional marketplace. On September 10, 2001, a 
consortium led by the British Airports Authority (BAA) and 
the local firm Bahwan Trading Company (BTC) established the 
Oman Airports Management Company (OAMC).  The largest 
shareholder in OAMC was an entity called Capital Aviation 
Services (75 percent shareholding), with the remaining shares 
held by the Omani government and Oman Aviation Services. 
Operating under a 25-year license granted in January 2002, 
OAMC\'s mandate was to modernize the existing airport 
facilities at Seeb International Airport in Muscat and 
Salalah International Airport in southern Oman, and lay the 
groundwork for the construction of a new passenger terminal 
at Seeb Airport by 2007.  On October 20, 2004 newspaper 
headlines declared that Oman\'s privatization of airport 
management had come to an end with the pullout of BAA from 
OAMC, reportedly due to substantial disagreement over the 
financial terms of constructing the new terminal. 
Administration of the airports should revert to the 
government within 30 days according to the terms of the 
original concession agreement. 
 
------------------------------- 
Company Never Truly Took Flight 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) General Manager Alex Borges of BTC (strictly protect) 
told Econoff that the blame lies squarely on the government\'s 
shoulders for failing to approve a single expansion plan 
submitted by OAMC in slightly over two years of operation. 
Whereas the contract called for renegotiation clauses, 
company insiders claim that the government never appreciated 
the increased aviation security costs associated with the 
September 11 terrorist attacks and the resulting decline in 
Middle East passenger traffic, but rather showed complete 
unwillingness to accept any long-term proposal floated by the 
company.  Borges pointed to the Finance Ministry in 
particular as being uncompromising during the negotiations. 
 
4. (U) In a local newspaper interview, OAMC CEO Colin Hobbs 
expressed his own frustration over the inability of the 
government to understand the scarcity of commercial financing 
for expanding Middle Eastern airports in the wake of 
September 11th.  In addition, Hobbs intimated that Omani 
officials no doubt saw major airport projects being carried 
out by the governments of Doha and Dubai and decided to force 
OAMC\'s hand in order to reassume control and proceed with a 
publicly financed terminal project.  Hobbs echoed separate 
comments from Borges in saying that OAMC succeeded in 
operating the airports effectively, reducing their costs, and 
enhancing their commercial viability; the only thorny issue 
in the end was building the new terminal. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
The Flying Public Demanded More Change 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) News of the failed privatization generated mixed 
reaction around Muscat.  The business world was not greatly 
surprised that OAMC would fail to deliver on airport 
expansion after a series of difficult circumstances for the 
regional tourism industry (e.g., September 11, OEF and OIF, 
Bali bombings, SARS).  The local and regional media gave the 
matter greater attention, particularly given the 
ramifications for the government\'s privatization and tourism 
promotion efforts. 
 
6. (SBU) Average Omanis were, if anything, pleased with the 
news.  Most Omanis we have spoken to comment that apart from 
a significant facelift for the Muscat Duty Free shopping 
area, there were no major visible upgrades made to the 
existing terminal at Seeb under OAMC\'s tenure.  Moreover, the 
Omani public\'s skepticism toward the government is only 
exceeded by its distrust of foreign companies and the local 
burgher class represented by family firms such as the 
Bahwan\'s.  Much of the public therefore believes OAMC was 
likely unfairly benefiting from its deal with the government, 
and credits the Ministry of Transportation for finally 
putting an end to it.  These factors gave OAMC a serious PR 
headache, even as it tried to parlay public dissatisfaction 
with the existing terminal into some sort of accord on 
constructing a brand new terminal.  In the end this balancing 
act proved too difficult and costly for OAMC, leading to the 
company\'s dissolution. 
 
----------------------- 
The Government\'s Thrust 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) For its part, the government believes that OAMC never 
fully delivered on its core promises of upgrading facilities 
and laying out a feasible plan for future airport expansion. 
Acting Director General of Civil Aviation and Meteorology 
Sultan al-Saifi (strictly protect) described to Econoff the 
current situation, whereby a 100 percent Omani 
government-owned company called OMC will assume control of 
the airports.  Following the most recent 90-day period of 
discussions, the government agreed to buy the shares of 
Capital Aviation Services.  The original handover date of 
November 17 was accelerated because of Eid holidays and 
National Day celebrations, and the assets will now change 
hands no later than November 10.  Nearly all staff members of 
OAMC are expected to remain with the government company, 
including technical and managerial personnel from BAA who may 
stay aboard for up to six months.  Plans will move forward 
for a new terminal at Seeb airport under government guidance, 
and al-Saifi left open the possibility that private investors 
might be allowed to take equity stakes in future airport 
development projects. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) Beyond the finger-pointing and the disappointment on 
both sides, this development casts a shadow over the pace and 
scope of privatization in Oman.  Earlier hailed as a model of 
privatization for the GCC, Oman\'s airport management 
experiment appears for now to have failed, or at least been 
dealt a significant set-back.  Bureaucratic obstacles remain 
in other privatization fields as well. One prominent American 
businessman confided that the government does not want to see 
a foreign company make too much money in a privatized 
venture, lest it be perceived as a net loss for the Omani 
people.  Other commentators view the airport development as a 
\"black eye\" for Oman\'s investment climate, even if it is more 
a perception than the overall reality.

1. (U) The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core Emergency 
Action Committee (\"EAC\") on November 6 to reassess the 
Embassy\'s security posture following the local weekend, to 
discuss any potential security implications in the event that 
Chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) 
Yasser Arafat passes away, and to address the information 
contained in reftels B and C. 
 
---------------------------- 
Weekend Trespassing Incident 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The EAC reviewed the known facts regarding an 
incident involving an apparent criminal trespass that 
occurred over the local weekend.  On 11/05/2004, an Embassy 
employee observed an unidentified Indian male in his yard 
peering into the windows of the residence.  The employee 
immediately notified the Embassy\'s MSG Post One who summoned 
assistance.  The individual was subsequently apprehended by 
the Royal Oman Police (ROP) without further incident.  The 
motives for this incident are unknown and the ROP\'s 
investigation is continuing.  RSO re-emphasized the 
importance of immediately reporting such suspicious activity 
or security-related incidents to Post One. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Response to the Possible Death of the PLO\'s Yasser Arafat 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3. (SBU) The EAC discussed reports of PLO Chairman Yasser 
Arafat\'s deteriorating health.  The EAC determined that 
Arafat\'s death from natural causes would have little to no/no 
security implications for the Embassy.  The EAC noted that 
the Embassy\'s already heightened security posture continues 
to remain appropriate and that Arafat\'s death is not expected 
to resonate significantly with the Omanis. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Mail Screening and Nuclear Smuggling Reporting 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4. (SBU) RSO briefed all Country Team members as to the 
contents of reftels B and C.  Embassy section heads were 
advised to remind their staffs that until a separate mail 
screening facility can be established, Embassy personnel 
should refrain from opening all personal mail within the 
Chancery.  RSO also reiterated that all locally delivered 
mail and/or parcels be pre-screened in the Embassy\'s 
Pedestrian Access Control area separate from the main 
Chancery.  In addition, RSO distributed copies of reftel C to 
all Embassy sections, including the duty officer, MSG Post 
One, and the local guard force.  RSO emphasized that under no 
circumstances should any alleged nuclear material be brought 
into the Embassy compound, nor should Embassy personnel 
attempt to examine any such material. 
 
------------------------ 
Local Threat Environment 
------------------------ 
 
5. (S/NF) The EAC concluded that there has been no change in 
the local security environment since its last meeting held on 
November 3 (reftel A), and that the Embassy\'s FPCON remains 
appropriate.  Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely aware of 
the need to monitor both the regional and local security 
environments, and is prepared to take the necessary 
countermeasures should changes to either occur.  AMB, DCM, 
A/RSO, ESO, RMAS, CONS, P/E, PAO, MGT, MSG, DAO, OMC (USDR), 
and the Executive Coordinating Agency (USCENTAF) participated 
in the meeting.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Sultan Qaboos\' annual address to the Majlis Oman on 
October 12 stuck to familiar themes in economic and foreign 
policy.  He emphasized the usual twin pillars of economic 
diversification and human resource development and focused on 
the newly established Ministry of Tourism as sign of 
government commitment to expand that sector of the service 
economy.  On foreign policy, the Sultan called for progress 
toward a Palestinian state, security and stability in Iraq, 
the return of occupied territories, and the primacy of 
justice and peaceful dialogue in international relations. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------ 
WE ARE ONE VILLAGE 
------------------ 
 
2. (U) On October 12, Sultan Qaboos presided over the 
ceremonial opening session of the Majlis Oman (a joint 
session of the elected Majlis al-Shura and appointed Majlis 
al-Dawla).  Members of the royal family, cabinet ministers, 
key government figures and the diplomatic corps assembled for 
the 10-minute speech that was simultaneously broadcast live 
to audiences in Oman, the UAE, Egypt, Yemen, and Qatar. (Full 
text in para 6.) 
 
3. (SBU) In a preamble, the Sultan called for fearless 
interaction with foreign civilizations and cultures, 
comparing a planet shrunk by modern technology to \"one 
village\" wherein no society can isolate itself from 
developments around it.  He advocated riding the wave of 
technological innovations in other countries to achieve 
\"prosperity and welfare\" for the Omani people. 
 
4. (U) The middle portion of the address was devoted to 
economics.  The Sultan assured his audience that the 
government is striving to raise the pillars of a modern state 
and increase living standards, with particular focus on 
diversification of income sources.  He stated that the 
development projects being implemented (primarily in gas-fed 
industries, ports and tourism) will \"undoubtedly\" contribute 
to diversification of the economy and provide larger 
opportunities for training and employment of Omanis.  The 
Sultan pointed to his decision to establish a Ministry of 
Tourism to manage such a \"vital sector\" as evidence of his 
hopes for this growing sector. 
 
5. (U) The final third of the speech concerned foreign 
policy.  The Sultan called for an end to \"Palestinian daily 
suffering\" and the need to give Palestinians the opportunity 
to establish an independent state.  He hoped for security and 
stability to prevail over Iraq, and for the recovery of Arab 
territories under foreign occupation.  The Sultan vowed that 
Oman will \"always take sides with rightness, justness, and 
joint efforts... to settle international conflicts through 
dialogue and negotiations.\"

FULL TEXT

6.  (U) Dear Citizens, It gives us pleasure to speak to you 
today, as we meet on the occasion of the annual session of 
the Council of Oman, to reaffirm our determination and 
resolution to work diligently, with full confidence in God\'s 
will, towards broadening the horizons of a sustainable 
comprehensive development.  And we must bear in mind that 
this will only be attainable through means of knowledge, work 
and being broad-minded in keeping abreast of today,s 
developments and achievements in all walks of life, while at 
the same time preserving our basic principles and our firm 
roots.  We should be fearless when communicating with 
different civilizations and cultures around the world, and in 
exploring the accomplishments and developments in those 
communities, in order to enhance our position in a world 
which, due to the latest scientific advancements has become 
smaller, like a village, where no society can isolate itself 
without interacting and communicating with others; that is, 
if that society seeks to achieve prosperity and welfare for 
its citizens. 
 
This was the case with our Omani ancestors who, throughout 
the ages, traveled to different parts of the world.  They 
extended the hand of friendship to all and looked forward 
with optimism to the mutual exchange of interests with other 
communities without taking sides. 
 
Dear Citizens, As you know, our goals are the implementation 
of successive development plans in the Sultanate, to finish 
the main infrastructure of a modern state, and to raise the 
living standards in all areas of our dear homeland.  This is 
being accomplished in accordance with specific programs, 
which have been studied very carefully, and which are aimed 
at increasing the ratio of economic development with more 
emphasis on the diversification of the sources of national 
income and the development of human resources. 
 
In this respect, the outcome of the policies followed by our 
government to encourage all non-oil sectors is now visible, 
thanks be to God.  We can already see the projects which have 
been completed and those which are now on-going.  These will 
all lead to an increase in the national income and will 
provide more, and larger, opportunities for work and 
training, and thus we will gain more and new skills for the 
youth of Oman who are keen to take over different jobs in 
various fields of employment. 
 
We have a strong belief in the importance of the tourism 
sector, since it is an emerging industry at international 
level where it has become one of the main sources of revenue 
in many developed countries.  And because God has bestowed 
our country with an environment and geographical diversity, 
as well as other essential elements, that makes it a 
favorable tourist destination in the region, we took the 
decision to establish a Ministry of Tourism to administer 
this vital and important sector.  We hope that those who are 
in charge of its work will take the appropriate steps to 
expedite the implementation of the carefully studied 
procedures and steps which are necessary to development this 
sector in the near future, God willing.  This should be 
achieved through co-ordination with the other concerned 
government departments and the private sector. 
 
Dear Citizens,  We wish to underline in this important annual 
session the attention and emphasis we place on economic 
development and human resources in our dear motherland.  Our 
foreign policy is based, as you know, on certain fundamental 
principles which we have not deviated from; namely, that we 
always take sides with rightness, justice, and joint efforts 
with other peace-loving nations to settle international 
conflicts through dialogue and negotiations so that security 
and stability may prevail and all nations on earth will be 
able to reap the benefits thereof.  And on that basis, we 
call again for the lifting of the daily suffering endured by 
the Palestinian people and the need to give them the 
opportunity to achieve their goals and establish an 
independent state.  We also hope that the Arab states, whose 
lands are still under occupation, will be able to recover 
them and that security and stability may prevail in Iraq and 
prosperity and progress reign in our region and the whole 
world.  We also call for respect for international law and 
the principles and conventions upon which it is based, and 
for tolerance between communities and races. 
 
May God make this country secure and stable, protect it, and 
bestow on its people abundant fruits.  You are the hearer, 
the responder and able to do all things. End text.

A Post-Arafat PA 
---------------- 
 
1. On November 7, the privately-owned Arabic daily \"Al-Watan\" 
published an editorial entitled \"Palestinian Unification\": 
 
\"The Palestinian Authority is going through a dangerous phase. 
The declining health of President Yasir Arafat plays into the 
hands of the Israelis, who fully expect the rise of conflict 
between rival Palestinian factions.  The Israeli side is hoping 
for armed confrontation between these factions, so that they can 
impose their will upon the Palestinians.  The only way to solve 
this sensitive issue is to have a national dialogue among all the 
Palestinians in order to reach a collective agreement on pressing 
national issues.  The Palestinian Authority needs to put forth an 
agenda with defined priorities, and then follow that agenda.\" 
 
--------------- 
The Way Forward 
--------------- 
 
2. Government-owned Arabic daily \"Oman\" published an editorial on 
November 8 under the headline \"The Iraqi Scene\": 
 
\"The tragedy in Iraq continues, and innocents are falling every 
day.  The hope of a peaceful and unified Iraq is becoming 
fainter.  The issues are growing more complicated between the two 
sides: those who want to get rid of the invaders, and those who 
want to finish the political process by participating in the 
January elections.  Amongst the daily shedding of blood, it is 
necessary to find a way forward; basic services for the Iraqis 
must be improved in order to give a more optimistic picture for 
the future.  Another critical element is to have a revised 
American policy in Iraq.  According to an Australian expert, the 
Americans \'should forget the implementation of democracy, and 
concentrate instead on training the national forces to support 
citizens\' basic needs such as food and employment.\'\" 
 
------------------- 
American Juggernaut 
------------------- 
 
3. Obeid al-Shaqsi penned an op-ed piece in \"Oman\" on November 8 
entitled \"Is Bush Planning for Another War?\": 
 
\"President Bush\'s victory in the election over Senator Kerry made 
the Republicans more confident.  He and his advisors see this 
victory as a sign of strong support for the policy of using force 
against terrorism.  This means that the president will have few 
difficulties convincing the American public of the need to fight 
terrorism, or even of expanding the list of countries on whom he 
would like to wage war.  Many observers expected a different 
electoral outcome, given that there were strong American 
objections to the war in Iraq.  However, it seems that the Bush 
administration -- through its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- has 
succeeded in marketing a positive idea about the legality of war 
and its ability to bring development and success to these 
countries.  The American media also flooded the American people 
with cheerful news about the crushing of the Taliban, the 
upcoming elections in Afghanistan, and the spread of democracy in 
Iraq, while seemingly ignoring the widespread resistance to 
American occupation and the coffins resulting from this 
resistance.  This time, President Bush not only has the American 
people standing behind him, but also the Republican-dominated 
Congress.\"

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core Emergency 
Action Committee (\"EAC\") on November 9 to reassess the 
Embassy\'s security posture prior to the holiday weekend and 
to discuss any security implications of anticipated offensive 
operations in Fallujah Iraq (reftel A). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Response to Anticipated Offensive Operations in Fallujah 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. (S/NF) The EAC reviewed the known facts regarding the 
ongoing offensive military operations in Fallujah, Iraq.  The 
EAC determined that such operations would pose little to 
no/no security implications for the Embassy.  The EAC noted 
that Omani public opinion would be shaped in large part on 
how this latest offensive is portrayed in the regional and 
local media.  The EAC concluded that there has been no change 
in the local security environment since its last meeting held 
on November 6 (reftel B) and that the Embassy\'s FPCON (Bravo) 
and already heightened security posture remain appropriate. 
RSO and RMAS affirmed that their Omani government 
counterparts continue to emphasize that they have control of 
the local security situation and are poised to respond to any 
imminent threat to American personnel or interests in Oman. 
 
------------------------------ 
Maintaining Personal Vigilance 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (S/NF) Prior to concluding the meeting, RSO reiterated 
that members of the EAC should continue reinforcing to both 
their staffs and family members the need for vigilance 
regarding all aspects of personal security, including the 
need to maintain a low profile and to remain unpredictable. 
RSO also re-emphasized the importance of immediately 
reporting suspicious activity or security-related incidents, 
especially those involving suspected surveillance, to Post 
One.  The EAC remains acutely aware of the need to monitor 
both the regional and local security environments, and is 
prepared to take the necessary countermeasures should changes 
to either occur.  AMB, DCM, A/RSO, RMAS, OMC (USDR), DAO, 
P/E, MGT, and ECA (USCENTAF) participated in the meeting.

1. Summary:  The Omani Internet chat room \"Sablat al-Arab\" -- or 
simply \"Al-Sablah\" -- is the liveliest and most comprehensive 
Arabic-language forum for political and social discourse in the 
country, touching on issues and personalities rarely addressed in 
the conventional media.  While not totally free, nor wholly 
reflective of Omani public opinion, Al-Sablah nevertheless offers 
a worthwhile window into the hot topics and unvarnished views of 
the day.  This edition of Oman Online contains the following 
topics: 
 
--- The Sultan\'s Cable To President Bush 
--- Demolishing the Diwan (Omani Royal Court) 
--- Call For Demonstration 
 
End summary. 
 
----------- 
Sour Grapes 
----------- 
 
2. Sultan Qaboos\' cable congratulating President Bush on his re- 
election triggered feelings of discontent among Al-Sablah 
members.  One participant expressed his disappointment with the 
cable, saying \"Oman has a close relationship with the United 
States that the Sultan wants to consolidate; however, this is not 
the general feeling among the Omanis.\"  Expressions of anger and 
sadness at the futility of changing Omani government policy 
dominated the topic, including the following comment: \"We cannot 
do anything except say \'Congratulations\' to Bush.  This is what 
our government wants from us.\"  Another member sarcastically 
remarked, \"You [Bush] deserved victory in the election, for you 
fought terrorism for three years by attacking Afghanistan and 
Iraq.\" 
 
------------------- 
Down With The Diwan 
------------------- 
 
3. Speculation about the budget of the Diwan, Oman\'s Royal Court, 
was a contentious issue in Al-Sablah.  Many participants argued 
that at the beginning of Sultan Qaboos\' reign, the Diwan was 
esteemed as a source of aid for needy Omanis.  However, as one 
participant put it, \"The Diwan is now viewed as a means by which 
VIPs, Al Saids [the royal family] and Sheikhs can obtain luxury 
items.\"  One bold individual argued, \"This worthless ministry 
should be done away with.  It is a waste of Oman\'s wealth.\" 
 
------------------ 
Demonstrably Upset 
------------------ 
 
4. In recent days, a call was put forth in Al-Sablah urging 
university and high school students in Oman to demonstrate in 
front of the U.S. Embassy to show support for the Iraqi people. 
The author of the call wrote, \"Let\'s all unify against the 
aggressor and march peacefully to express our rejection of the 
crimes that America is committing in Iraq.\"  One respondent 
replied, \"Let\'s show as much support for the Iraqis in Fallujah 
as we did for the Palestinians in Jenin when they were attacked 
by the Israelis.\"  Many subscribers supported the idea of a 
demonstration, and several suggested that a demonstration also be 
held at the British Embassy and at the governors\' offices in each 
province.  However, most participants expressed pessimism about 
the usefulness of demonstrations.  One contributor asked, \"What 
good would a demonstration in Oman do?  Would it make the U.S. 
and Britain change their position?\"  Another commented, \"We 
Muslims are in a long sleep.  Will we not wake up until we hear 
the sound of airplanes attacking us?\"

REF: MUSCAT 01899 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Dr. Sharifa bint Khalfan bin Nasser 
al-Yahyai, Oman\'s new Minister of Social Development, is 
still getting used to her new job.  Working late into the 
Ramadan nights to get up to speed on the workings of her 
ministry, she reflected on her sudden transition from 
academia to a senior position in government.  While 
understandably reluctant to talk shop until she has fully 
mastered her brief, Dr. Sharifa enthusiastically expounded on 
the growing role of women in Omani society, while retaining 
their prominent role in family life.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------- 
SHOCK AND AWE 
------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) On November 7, the Ambassador and PolOff called on 
the new Minister of Social Development, Dr. Sharifa 
al-Yahyai.  Dr. Sharifa was appointed to the Ministry on 
October 20; subsequently, she has been busy getting to know 
what she calls the \"basics\" of the Ministry.  When asked 
about her appointment, Dr. Sharifa recalled being completely 
unaware of the pending announcement and confessed that, 
indeed, she had been \"shocked.\"  Describing that fateful day 
in detail, Dr. Sharifa said she received a call from the 
Royal Diwan early in the morning on October 20 and was 
requested to report there (on the opposite end of Muscat from 
her residence) within 45 minutes, without any reason given 
for her presence.  She gleefully described racing her car 
with a police escort over 160 km/hour into Old Muscat. 
 
3. (SBU) Arriving at the Diwan a few minutes late, Dr. 
Sharifa said she knew only that something very good -- or 
very bad -- would require such a summons.  Moments later, Dr. 
Sharifa was informed of Sultan Qaboos\' decision to honor her 
with the appointment as new Minister of Social Development. 
Dr. Sharifa recalled saying that she had to think about it, 
but was then quickly reminded that propriety hardly afforded 
her the option of declining the honor.  She recounted, \"It 
was like freezing water had been dropped on me.  I couldn\'t 
sleep for three nights thinking about how I\'m going to deal 
with these things.\"  Within two hours of her appointment, Dr. 
Sharifa was moved out of her modest housing near Sultan 
Qaboos University and into temporary quarters more suitable 
for a minister.  (Note: Several sources have said that new 
ministers receive signing bonuses anywhere from $1.5 to $2.5 
million in addition to a plot of land for building a new 
home.  End Note.) 
 
--------------------------------- 
THE RIGHT WOMAN FOR THE RIGHT JOB 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) When asked why she thought she was chosen, Dr. 
Sharifa said she believes Omani women are finally taking 
their rightful place in society.  \"Women are getting 
positions to serve the right people at the right time.\"  She 
referred to Sultan Qaboos as visionary and pointed out that 
there are now a good number of female ministers, women of 
great maturity, respect and intelligence. 
 
---------------- 
ALL IN GOOD TIME 
---------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Dr. Sharifa declined to discuss her Ministry\'s work 
until she had more time to study the major issues, including 
the problem of the lengthy registration process for 
non-governmental organizations (NGO), and the current status 
of her Ministry\'s help to identify students for the U.S. 
Embassy\'s English-language micro-scholarship program.  When 
asked about her children or her academic years, she was 
engaging and enthusiastic.  Dr. Sharifa was also animated in 
recounting her trip to England last summer with her two 
children and her wish sometimes that she were still in 
school. 
 
6.  (U) Dr. Sharifa shared her thoughts about women\'s 
empowerment and gender studies, including the need for more 
critical analysis of women in society and their roles as 
mothers and wives.  Dr. Sharifa said that she believes some 
societies see women as second class citizens and that only 
through reading, writing about, and understanding their 
legitimate role will women attain full rights. 
 
7. (U) At the end of the meeting, Dr. Sharifa said she feels 
increasingly confident that she is approaching the time when 
she will be ready to \"act on these things,\" pointing to the 
mounds of paperwork on her desk.  The Ambassador underscored 
the Embassy\'s close relationship with the Ministry and our 
commitment to continuing our partnership.  Dr. Sharifa 
agreed, but lamented the fact that she must first understand 
what\'s going on in her Ministry before getting down to the 
real work of helping the people. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Dr. Sharifa\'s is a very impressive individual who 
is already thinking in the long term.  Although she did not 
indicate at what point a new Under Secretary will help share 
the burden, she appears to be a quick study who will minimize 
the time it will take to parlay fourteen years in academia to 
her new career in public service.

meeting with Dr. Sharifa bint Khalfan bin Nasser al-Yahyai, 
the newly appointed Minister of Social Development.  This 
cable provides additional biographic information. 
 
-------- 
WHY HER? 
-------- 
 
2.  (U) Dr. Sharifa al-Yahyai, a former Arabic literature 
professor at Sultan Qaboos University, was appointed Minister 
of Social Development October 20, 2004.  She described her 
keen interest in women\'s issues and the progressive vision of 
Sultan Qaboos as the most probable factors contributing to 
her surprise appointment.  While in her new post, she 
admitted having to ask a lot of questions and spending many 
late nights in the office just getting to understand the 
basics. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Dr. Sharifa hails from Barka, about 70 km. west of 
Muscat on the Batinah coast.  At 34 (she was born in 1970, 
the year Qaboos came to power), Dr. Sharifa is one of the 
youngest ministers in the cabinet.  She is married to 
Abdullah al-Kindi, Deputy Dean of Student Affairs at Sultan 
Qaboos University (SQU) and has two children, Azzan (four) 
and Shareem (two and a half).  Her brother Mohammed (a press 
freedom activist) currently lives in Alexandria, VA and works 
for the USG-funded \"Al-Hurra\" Arabic satellite TV channel. 
Dr. Sharifa has never been to the United States but has had 
at one trip to Washington and Florida postponed within the 
past year. She spoke fondly of her time at Leeds University 
in the U.K. and her visit there last summer with her 
children. 
 
5.  (SBU) Prior to her appointment, Dr. Sharifa worked for 
two years at SQU teaching Arabic poetry.  In addition to her

6.  (C) In conversations with friends, colleagues, and former 
students of Dr. Sharifa, she has been described as 
hard-working and very bright.  While even her friends were 
surprised at her appointment, all agree that Dr. Sharifa is 
quite intelligent.  She appears to lack the conventional 
practical skills of Ministry work, but she is highly educated 
and boasts a passion for women\'s issues and their development 
in Omani society.  Dr. Sharifa spoke often of women\'s role as 
mother and wife, and stressed the importance of further 
research and writing to foster understanding of the important 
roles women play in society\'s development. 
 
7.  (C)  Dr. Sharifa met the Ambassador alone, with no 
assistant present.  She outwardly appears quite modest, 
donning the traditional abaya and headcovering, with an 
apparent affinity for pink lace.  Dr. Sharifa\'s English was 
impeccable as she spoke nostalgically of her time at Leeds 
and even at SQU before her surprise appointment at the 
Ministry.  While she admitted to finding it difficult 
adjusting to the rigorous demands of the Ministry as opposed 
to those of academia, she did appear confident that she will 
rise to the challenge to \"serve the people.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core Emergency 
Action Committee (\"EAC\") on November 13 to reassess the 
Embassy\'s security posture prior to Eid al Fitr, to evaluate 
the local implications per the Department\'s recent Public 
Announcement for the Middle East and North Africa (reftel A), 
and to discuss the information contained in reftel B. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Response to the Department\'s Public Announcement 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (SBU) The EAC reviewed the Department\'s recent Public 
Announcement for the Middle East and North Africa regarding 
the death of Palestinian Authority (PA) Chairman Yasser 
Arafat (reftel A).  The EAC determined that Arafat\'s death 
has had no/no security implications for the Embassy.  The EAC 
noted that the Embassy\'s already heightened security posture 
continues to remain appropriate and that Arafat\'s death has 
not resonated significantly with the Omanis.  Despite the 
relative calm, the Ambassador reminded the Committee to 
maintain a high level of vigilance and to take the necessary 
steps to increase their security awareness. 
 
----------------------------- 
Response to Terrorist Tactics 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) In accordance with reftel B, A/RSO confirmed that 
all consular, public diplomacy, and commercial personnel will 
be briefed on recent trends in terrorist/extremist tactics in 
targeting public access areas.  In addition to the employees\' 
increased awareness, the Embassy recently installed a new L3 
Security and Detection Systems x-ray machine in the public 
access control facility (reftel C).  This enhanced detection 
capability helps prevent weapons, explosives, and other 
contraband items from entering such public areas.  The 
Embassy also deploys its Surveillance Detection assets to 
both the consular and Information Resources Center in an 
unpredictable and irregular basis so as to provide critical 
observation while maintaining essential operational cover 
(reftel D). 
 
-------------------------- 
Local Security Environment 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (S/NF) Members of the EAC cited no security incidents 
among their staffs or dependents during the long local 
weekend.  CONS confirmed that there were no security 
incidents or related queries from the private American 
citizen community.  RSO and RMAS affirmed that their Omani 
government counterparts continue to emphasize that they have 
control of the local security situation and are poised to 
respond to any imminent threat to American personnel or 
interests in Oman.  Prior to concluding the meeting, A/RSO 
reiterated that members of the EAC should continue 
reinforcing to both their staffs and family members the need 
to maintain a low profile and to remain unpredictable.  A/RSO 
also re-emphasized the importance of immediately reporting 
suspicious activity or security-related incidents, especially 
those involving suspected surveillance, to Post One.  The EAC 
remains acutely aware of the need to monitor both the 
regional and local security environments, and is prepared to 
take the necessary countermeasures should changes to either 
occur.  AMB, DCM, A/RSO, RMAS, OMC (USDR), DAO, P/E, MGT, 
CONS, PAO, and ECA (USCENTAF) participated in the meeting.

No Aid for Fallujah 
------------------- 
 
1. Privately-owned Arabic daily \"Al-Watan\" published an editorial 
on November 16 under the headline \"Weak on Humanitarianism\": 
 
\"Recent U.S. military operations in Fallujah show a lack of 
humanitarian concern on the part of those charged with executing 
the military campaign.  Innocent people are being killed.  Some 
press reports claim that serious human rights violations are 
taking place.  Others allege that there are no procedures in 
place to protect unarmed civilians and that American forces 
prevent aid organizations from entering the city.  Media 
broadcasts show dead bodies littering the streets.  Amnesty 
International has called upon the U.S. to abide by international 
law and protect injured insurgents who are no longer able to 
continue fighting, particularly after a British TV station 
broadcast the killing of an injured Iraqi by an American soldier 
on November 11.\" 
 
--------------- 
Achieving Peace 
--------------- 
 
2. An editorial appeared in the government-owned Arabic daily 
\"Oman\" on November 14 entitled \"The Need for Peace\": 
 
\"Experience has shown that the use of force to resolve the 
problems of the Middle East does not work.  The events in Iraq 
over the past year-and-a-half should make it clear to everyone 
that military assaults are not the answer.  The United States and 
other world powers should pursue other options - new policies - 
to resolve the region\'s conflicts.  For example, America\'s 
discussion of the Palestinian issue should not be theoretical. 
It should be as concrete as possible, giving as much detail as 
feasible about how the U.S. plans to advance the peace process, 
particularly with regard to Israel\'s withdrawal from Palestinian 
territories.  The `War against Terror\' has become a ruse to 
justify the escalation in violence and the violation of human 
rights.  Without active international involvement and a just 
resolution of the conflicts within the framework of international 
law, there cannot be peace in the region.\" 
 
------------- 
End Of An Era 
------------- 
 
3. \"Oman\" also carried an editorial on November 13 entitled \"The 
Last Farewell\": 
 
\"The Palestinian people, together with the Arab and Islamic 
world, bid a final farewell to Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. 
He spent more than four decades trying to improve the situation 
of his people. Firm in his belief in God and the fairness of his 
cause, Arafat carried the sorrows and tragedies of the 
Palestinians to all parts of the world, highlighting the tyranny 
of the Israelis.  Since his days as the president of the 
Palestinian Student Union in Cairo, Arafat walked along this 
difficult path.  He left his people with a solid foundation for 
the future.  The widespread international respect given to Arafat 
upon his death indicates that the world will continue to view the 
Palestinians as living symbols of a people unjustly driven from 
their land.\"

Summary

1. (U) The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core Emergency 
Action Committee (\"EAC\") on November 17 to reassess the 
Embassy\'s security posture prior to the local holiday weekend 
and to discuss any security implications of recent military 
events in Fallujah, Iraq. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Local Response to Events in Fallujah 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (S/NF) The EAC reviewed the known facts regarding the 
ongoing military operations in Fallujah, Iraq.  The EAC 
determined that, at present, such operations have posed 
little to no/no security implications for the Embassy. 
However, as discussed in reftel B, Omani public opinion is 
shaped in large part on how these military events are 
portrayed in the regional and local media.  The Committee 
noted that the  controversial video footage of a U.S. Marine 
shooting an allegedly unarmed insurgent in a Fallujah mosque 
is receiving extensively critical coverage in the local 
newspapers.  The EAC concluded that there has been no change 
in the local security environment since its last meeting held 
on November 13 (reftel A) and that the Embassy\'s FPCON 
(Bravo) and already heightened security posture remain 
appropriate.  RSO and RMAS affirmed that their Omani 
government counterparts continue to emphasize that they have 
control of the local security situation and are poised to 
respond to any imminent threat to American personnel or

SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR SPEAKER ON WITCHES BROOM DISEASE 
 
REF: STATE 228322 
 
1. Embassy Muscat requests that IIP and EB fund one or more 
agricultural biotechnology speakers to participate in Sultan 
Qaboos University\'s first international conference on the 
\"Prevention and Treatment of Witches Broom Disease of Lime Trees\" 
which will be held March 13-16, 2005.  This request is keyed to 
the IIP speaker request format.  Details follow: 
 
2. Background: Witches Broom Disease of Lime Trees (WBDL) has 
decimated the Sultanate of Oman\'s once-vibrant lime industry. The 
symptoms of the disease -- abnormal growth on branches resembling 
tiny brooms of twigs -- were first described in Oman\'s lime trees 
in 1986, and by 1994 some 5% of the country\'s lime trees were 
infected.  Oman\'s strain of WBDL is particularly virulent and by 
1996, virtually all trees had succumbed, according to the Food 
and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  Infected trees frequently 
survive a few years with poor yields and poor quality fruit, and 
ultimately die.  In recent years the disease has spread to 
neighboring countries such as the United Arab Emirates, India, 
Iran and Pakistan and now poses a threat to lime and citrus 
worldwide.  Oman used to grow enough limes (traditionally the 
second major fruit crop after dates) for local consumption and 
even export, but now must import the fruit.  Effective treatment 
of the disease and the introduction of resistant hybrids will 
promote sustainable agriculture, increase acceptance of 
agricultural biotechnology in Oman, and potentially reduce 
migratory pressures from traditional agricultural areas in Oman. 
 
3. MPP Goal: Both the Embassy and conference organizers from 
Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) believe that American expertise in 
this field is invaluable in identifying appropriate prevention, 
treatment and containment strategies for WBDL.  Significant work 
on WBDL has been conducted in the United States at U.S. 
Department of Agriculture and private research institutions, 
particularly in the development of disease-resistant hybrids. 
Prevention and containment of the disease advances the Embassy\'s 
MPP goal of supporting Oman\'s economic growth to better the lives 
of all Omanis, particularly those in rural areas.  U.S. 
participation in the conference will also support Oman\'s efforts 
to protect its agricultural and environmental resources from 
disease that, if left unchecked, could devastate the regional 
lime industry.  The conference will serve as a catalyst to bring 
the Gulf countries and others together to share research and 
ideas on how to combat the spread of the disease and help to 
revive Oman\'s historical lime production by finding solutions to 
WBDL. 
 
4. Specific Subject Speaker Is Expected To Address: This 
conference will present research on WBDL, explore prevention and 
treatment strategies, and propose transnational responses to the 
disease.  The speaker should be prepared to address one or more 
of the above topics, and discuss the results of plant material 
research linked to the disease conducted by USDA facilities and 
private institutes in the United States. 
 
5. Audience: Officials from the ministries of Agriculture and 
Fisheries; Regional Municipalities, Environment, and Water 
Resources; and Commerce and Industry; horticultural scientists, 
academics and international citrus researchers; businesspeople 
and farmers.  SQU organizers expect participation from the entire 
GCC region and parts of South Asia where WBDL has spread. 
 
6. Level Of Speaker Expertise: The speaker will lecture at a 
major international conference, participating as a discussant in 
sessions of the conference.  The speaker will address strategies 
for treating WBDL and present proposals for transnational 
responses to the disease.  In addition to the conference, the 
Embassy will program the speaker at agricultural colleges, where 
he/she will be asked to address Sudden Decline of Mango disease 
(SDM), which is also present in Oman.  In addition, the speaker 
will engage in press interviews on his/her area of expertise. 
 
7. Time Frame: FY05; Q2; Embassy requests speaker for four days 
(March 12-16, 2005).  Arrive before March 12.  Conference dates 
are March 13-16, 2005. 
 
8. Name Request: Embassy requests that IIP recruit one or more of 
the following speakers, all of whom are knowledgeable about the 
treatment and prevention of WBDL and SDM.  They have also served 
as advisors to government agencies on policies to prevent the 
spread of agricultural diseases.  The suggested speakers are

SUBJECT: OMAN: POST SUPPORT FOR MEPI PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 238836 
 
1. To date there are no MEPI program implementers with 
offices in Oman, although we understand there may be some 
considering establishing a full-time presence in Muscat. 
Amideast is one such organization, and is currently 
consulting with a local law firm on the legalities and 
formalities of establishing an office in the Sultanate. 
 
2. As for administrative hurdles to overcome, Omani 
regulations and bureaucracy can be daunting to navigate, 
particularly for the closely monitored NGOs.  Strict banking 
regulations typically require legal standing in Oman before a 
bank account can be opened, which is a difficulty for many 
organizations that would be considered \"non-profit\" or NGOs 
in other countries.   Only a handful of NGOs are formally 
registered through the Ministry of Social Development in 
Oman.  Nonetheless, the nascent Muscat American Business 
Council (MABC), the new American Chamber of Commerce in Oman, 
managed to open an account with an international bank in 
Muscat despite its informal status, largely with the help of 
government ministers who support the notion of an American 
business council, and by the strong backing of the U.S. 
Embassy.  Other potential hurdles for MEPI implementers exist 
in the labor realm, where labor clearances and formal 
sponsorships would need to be obtained for any expatriate 
employees an implementer would want to hire.  Moreover, the 
government\'s Omanization policy could impact the number of 
expatriate staff as a proportion of the total payroll. 
 
3. Comment: A full picture of the potential administrative 
difficulties that could confront MEPI implementers requires a 
more extensive legal analysis.  In many ways, this is 
uncharted territory in a nation like Oman.  As we have seen 
with the MABC and other informal groups, however, there is 
room for maneuver given the right circumstances and the 
appropriate level of backing from the USG.  Oman continues to 
be fertile ground for MEPI programming, and there are 
possibilities in the NGO sector today that did not exist even 
a few years ago.  We do not believe that MEPI implementers 
would find it impossible or impracticable to work here, but 
bureaucratic hurdles will need be overcome, particularly for 
the first implementers to seek a full-time presence.

SUBJECT: CODEL THOMAS DISCUSSES POTENTIAL FTA WITH TOP OMANI 
LEADERSHI P 
 
1.  SUMMARY: In lengthy meetings with Sultan Qaboos and Oman\'s 
Foreign Minister, as well as a brief but productive final meeting 
with the Omani Commerce Minister, CODEL Thomas took advantage of 
the opportunity to explore Oman\'s readiness to jump into full- 
blown free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations over the next 6-8 
months. Chairman Thomas emphasized the need to look carefully at 
Oman\'s labor legislation to make sure it meets core international 
standards, as well as the need for complete transparency 
regarding the criteria for foreign investment in Oman. Sultan 
Qaboos pledged that Oman would work closely with the U.S. in 
addressing these concerns, a message reiterated by the other 
ministers. Chairman Thomas outlined his support for expediting 
Oman\'s FTA timetable, and pledged to work constructively with the 
Sultanate in the coming months as the process blazes forward. End 
Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Full Speed Ahead 
---------------------- 
 
2.  During their 2-day visit to Oman November 8-9, five lawmakers 
from the House Ways and Means Committee met with top Omani 
leaders to discuss trade relations and the possibility of 
negotiating an expedited FTA between Oman and the U.S. Led by 
Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA) and including Reps. Mike McNulty (D- 
NY) , Nancy Johnson (R-CT) , Phil English (R-PA) , and Ron Lewis 
(R-KY) , the delegation had an afternoon audience with Sultan 
Qaboos, dinner with Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs 
Yusuf bin Alawi, and a brief meeting with Minister of Commerce 
and Industry Maqbool bin Ali bin Sultan. In all three encounters, 
Chairman Thomas clearly expressed his desire to move forward on 
FTA talks within the next 6-8 months, before the expiration of 
Trade Promotion Authority in July 2005. 
 
3. Thomas buttressed his remarks by saying that Oman has proven 
to be a staunch ally in the region, with extremely positive 
bilateral military relations. There is no reason, he asserted, 
that trade relations between the two countries should not blossom 
in similar fashion. Moreover, the high quality of the commitments 
that Oman made in its accession to the WTO in 2000 means that the 
Sultanate has already taken many strong steps toward liberalizing 
its trade regime. Looking at potential trading partners around 
the world, Thomas and his colleagues believe that very few could 
manage an ambitious timetable for completing FTA negotiations in 
the next 6-8 months; Oman is one of them, and it is critical to 
seize the window of opportunity. Sultan Qaboos and the other 
interlocutors expressed satisfaction with this perspective, and 
offered any and all assistance in seeing the process through. 
\"It\'s to our advantage [to conclude an FTA], and we look forward 
to working with you,\" declared the Sultan. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Labor as Key Stumbling Block 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. Chairman Thomas explicitly mentioned the caveat that all FTAs 
require bipartisan support to pass Congress. Labor is one area 
where Oman could face difficulty in this regard, and CODEL Thomas 
did not hesitate to raise this issue with Sultan Qaboos and his 
ministers. In spite of a new labor law passed in 2003, Thomas and 
his colleagues still need to verify that Oman is adhering to core 
labor standards as defined by the ILO. Of particular concern are 
the right to strike, to bargain collectively, to take labor cases 
to an independent court, and to form unions. 
 
5. The policy of Omanization could also be a sticking point, 
particularly in fields where Omanis may show unwillingness to 
work despite having positions set aside for them. Such 
distortions in the labor market, claimed Thomas, could lead to 
situations where Omanis exaggerate their bargaining leverage. 
Members of the CODEL also seemed interested in the Omani programs 
designed to promote entrepreneurship and self-employment, such as 
the SANAD Fund, the Youth Fund, and other similar programs run by 
the Omani government whereby young people can apply for soft 
loans to start small businesses in their communities. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Transparency and Investment 
----------------------------------- 
 
6. Another concern clearly spelled out by Chairman Thomas was the 
lack of an objective, transparent standard for foreign investment 
above the 70 percent level. Although Minister Maqbool sought to 
reassure Thomas that \"all American investment is welcome\" and 
that the real concern was a flood of small-scale investments 
(groceries, barber shops, etc.) from South Asia, Thomas insisted 
that the criteria for investment must be universal and 
transparent if an FTA is to win approval in the U.S. Congress. 
Otherwise, Oman risks the perception of discriminatory treatment 
of investment. Using the examples of insurance and banking, where 
Oman has taken strong steps to reassure foreign investors and 
establish clear rules and regulations, Thomas urged Oman to 
examine its foreign investment laws to guarantee maximum 
transparency leading up to FTA talks. In response to a query from 
Minister Maqbool regarding possibly finding a way to welcome 
American companies and investment without a full opening to the 
subcontinent, Chairman Thomas suggested that Oman look carefully 
at the Bahrain and Morocco agreements, where similar exceptional 
circumstances were addressed. Not all FTAs are alike, explained 
Thomas, but the important element is that they do not fall below 
certain baselines. 
 
------------------------- 
Strong Commitment 
------------------------- 
 
7. Without exception, CODEL Thomas heard from Oman\'s leaders that 
an FTA is desirable as soon as possible, and that the Omani 
government is willing to address the specific concerns brought 
forth by the USG. Sultan Qaboos emphasized that Oman would do its 
part: \"I\'ll make sure [the ministers] feel concern to get it 
done,\" he told the CODEL. Minister Maqbool elaborated by stating 
his desire to discuss \"what we\'re not doing right and what we 
need to work on.\" Thomas reciprocated by stating his intentions 
to move as quickly as possible, provided that Oman maintains 
strict adherence to the tightest of timelines. Thomas promised to 
work closely with the Omani government and USTR in the coming 
weeks and months. 
 
----------------------- 
Power of Example 
----------------------- 
 
8. One recurring theme was the advantage enjoyed by Oman in that 
the U.S. already has strong, recent agreements with Bahrain and 
Morocco. Thomas urged the Omanis to review these agreements to 
avoid reinventing the wheel. Moreover, accompanying staffers from 
CODEL Thomas passed along copies of correspondence from the 
Moroccan government to the USG regarding steps taken by Morocco 
to address labor concerns; the Embassy will share this 
correspondence with the Omani government as an example of how the 
adoption of a proactive stance on labor can significantly improve 
the chances of finalizing an FTA. Rep. English commented that the 
Morocco FTA demonstrated the importance of America\'s trading 
partners being aware of the political constraints involved in 
negotiating FTAs, particularly in areas such as labor and the 
environment. 
 
------------ 
Comment 
------------ 
 
9. As the CODEL heard repeatedly, the very top political 
leadership in Oman stands firmly behind FTA negotiations and 
recognizes the mutual benefit to be derived from free trade. This 
visit served to highlight the key areas in an FTA that will draw 
Congressional scrutiny, and Chairman\'s Thomas\' forthright style 
laid most of the stickiest points plainly on the table. Once the 
Omanis return from an extended Eid and National Day holiday, we 
expect to engage them at every opportunity to review areas where 
Omani legislation and enforcement currently fall short of FTA 
baselines, and to devise means of delivering technical assistance 
and conducting consultations where appropriate.

way to achieve this goal is through dialogue not by destroying 
Iraqi cities.  The French President was right when he said that, 
`American policies in Iraq are harmful..\' The international

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Oman\'s energetic new Minister of Sports, Ali 
al-Sunaidi, shared with the Ambassador his active agenda for 
developing athletics in Oman.  He is eager to build linkages 
to the U.S. and other countries, both to develop sports 
programs and training facilities, as well as to market Oman 
as an ideal venue for regional tournaments.  Acknowledging 
that his October appointment to a newly established ministry 
came as a surprise, Sunaidi is busy addressing the key 
complaints he said the Sultan had with the predecessor 
agency.  As one of the USG\'s key economic interlocutors 
during his stint as Ministry of Commerce Under Secretary, 
Sunaidi admitted that his new duties will preclude him from 
playing any role in the ongoing Free Trade Agreement talks 
with the U.S.  He had no insights when a new Commerce Under 
Secretary might be appointed.  The Embassy will look to the 
 
SIPDIS 
new Ministry of Sports as an ideal partner for engaging Omani 
youth.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On November 22, the Ambassador, accompanied by Pol/E 
Chief, paid a courtesy call  on the new Minister of Sports, 
Ali bin Masoud al-Sunaidi.  Sunaidi, who had been a key 
interlocutor with the USG on bilateral trade and investment 
issues during his erstwhile stint as Under Secretary at the 
Ministry of Commerce and Industry, was appointed to head the 
newly created ministry in a surprise royal decree October 20 
(reftel). 
 
----------------- 
A Surprise to All 
----------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Sunaidi admitted that his appointment as Minister of 
Sport came as a surprise, though he said he had worked while 
at the Ministry of Commerce (MOCI) on a number of committees 
that dealt with sports and youth-related issues.  The Sultan, 
he said, wanted a \"thematic\" change in the way the 
now-defunct General Organization for Youth, Sports and 
Culture Affairs (GOYSCA) did business.  One of GOYSCA\'s 
greatest weaknesses was its relationship with the media, 
which Sunaidi has immediately undertaken to address by 
launching its own website during the recent Eid al-Fitr 
holiday.  Putting his Commerce Ministry expertise to good 
use, Sunaidi teamed a trio of his Ministry\'s marketing 
experts with an outside graphics firm (a pair of brothers 
educated in the U.S.) and a local confectioner to further 
publicize the new website with a candy give-away that went 
from inception to distribution of 5000 gift boxes in just 3 
days.  The website (www.sportsoman.com) invites visitors to 
\"write to the Minister,\" and Sunaidi gleefully reported 
getting messages from Oman, Europe and North America (on 
everything from the high cost of tickets to the grammar on 
the website). 
 
4. (SBU) The Minister said the Sultan was also disappointed 
with how little GOYSCA interacted with ordinary Omanis. 
Demonstrating his hands-on approach, Sunaidi recalled working 
out in a local club and observing suspiciously well-sculpted 
weightlifters.  He interviewed star Omani bodybuilder Haji 
Shahban about the prevalence of steroid and other 
performance-enhancing drug use, and was alarmed to hear that 
indeed some Omani athletes are injecting banned substances. 
Sunaidi teamed with an Under Secretary from the Ministry of 
Health to talk to directors of several leading clubs and made 
a carrot-and-stick offer.  Sunaidi promised to use the 
resources of his Ministry to promote and advertise those 
clubs that enforced a zero-tolerance policy on illegal drugs, 
while threatening to revoke the registration and drive out of 
business any sports club that permitted such use.  Haji 
Shahban was enlisted to headline a public awareness campaign 
that will feature warning posters in sports facilities around 
the Sultanate.  (An interview with Shahban is also featured 
on the Ministry\'s website.)  In another effort at outreach, 
the Ministry is building an SMS network that will allow them 
to instantly send out text messages to cellular subscribers 
on sports events.  Such an network, the Minister said, would 
have been used to advertise the visit of two Georgetown 
University basketball players who came to Oman (Nov 21-23) as 
Embassy-sponsored cultural ambassadors. 
 
------------------------ 
Seeking Foreign Partners 
------------------------ 
 
5. (U) One of Sunaidi\'s top priorities is to put Oman on the 
international sports map.  He would like to see Oman take 
advantage of its public facilities to host regional and 
international events (everything from soccer tournaments and 
track and field competitions to rally racing).  He also 
thinks Oman could carve out a unique niche as a year-round 
high-altitude training center if such a facility could be 
built in the Jebel Akhdar mountains inland from Muscat.  The 
Ambassador suggested the U.S. Olympic Training Center in 
Colorado Springs or a similar facility in Flagstaff, Arizona 
as potential resources and exemplars.  Sunaidi is also 
looking to foreign partners to help his Ministry to develop 
its own lab and diagnostic center to assess the physical 
capacity of young athletes.  Oman\'s Ali al-Habsi, the leading 
goalie in the Norwegian soccer league, was never envisioned 
by his coaches and friends while growing up as a likely 
world-class athlete, according to Sunaidi.  He would like to 
discover other potential gifted athletes at an earlier age. 
Sunaidi also sees practical applications.  There is an entire 
industry of Omani skin divers who gather 7000 tons of abalone 
each year off the coast of Salalah, who are able to dive to 
great depths with no diving equipment.  Studying how these 
divers achieve this feat would serve both the fishing 
industry and sports medicine. 
 
6. (SBU) As a graduate himself (engineering) of the 
sports-crazed University of Miami, Sunaidi is keen on 
obtaining sports scholarships for more Omani athletes.  He 
said there are only three such scholarships currently 
available, which ultimately means finding good athletes with 
exceptional school records.  As a \"lifelong B-plus student,\" 
Sunaidi would prefer having many more scholarships available 
so that they can be awarded instead to exceptional athletes 
who are also good students.  U.S. scholarships, he lobbied, 
would give the USG excellent public relations benefit.  He 
envisions these student athletes becoming true leaders, both 
in sports and life beyond.  Building a culture of athlete 
leaders is one of his goals as minister.  (Though he used the 
analogy of developing \"quarterbacks,\" Sunaidi is opposed to 
the idea of popularizing American football in Oman.  Sunaidi 
is satisfied with following the progress of the Miami 
Hurricanes and Dolphins from afar.) 
 
7. (SBU) Saying the ministry currently has \"zero links to the 
U.S.\", Sunaidi seeks American interlocutors - not at the USOC 
level per se, but at the mid-levels.  He believes Omanis have 
a great potential to develop in such sports as volleyball, 
running, shooting, \"throwing sports\" (javelin, discus), 
marine sports, and equestrian events.  Oman already has 
leagues (\"associations\") for soccer, cricket (established 
earlier this month), field hockey, volleyball and basketball. 
 Rally racing is another potential growth sport, buoyed by 
the popularity of Oman\'s star rally racer Hamed al-Wahaibi. 
(Wahaibi started out racing motorcycles while pursuing a 
business degree at the University of San Diego, and in 2001 
became the first Arab to win a European rally race.  In 2004, 
he became a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF.)  He is intrigued 
by the notion of reality shows such as \"The Amazing Race\" 
coming to Oman, and has an idea to create his own television 
show centered around athletic competitions.  (Note: 
Curiously, Sunaidi gave no indication that he was tapping 
into his own alma mater at the U. of Miami to build linkages. 
 End note.) 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Hanging Up His Economic Shoes (For Now) 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Given the key role Sunaidi played in the bilateral 
trade relationship as the rising young star at the Ministry 
of Commerce, the Ambassador inquired if he foresaw playing 
any role in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) process now that 
the USG and Omani government have embarked upon it.  Sunaidi 
noted that he will have an equal voice in issues that come 
before the full cabinet, as any minister would.  But as 
Minister of Sports, he says he already has responsibility for 
the roughly 40 percent of the Omani population that falls 
between the ages of 10-26.  Given the huge task he has in 
bringing his new ministry up to the standards set by the 
Sultan, he said he would have absolutely no time to be 
involved in FTA.  He expressed confidence that Commerce 
Minister Maqbool Sultan will successfully navigate the Omani 
government through the FTA process, and could offer no 
insights into who or when a successor may be found as Under 
Secretary for Commerce and Industry.  (Comment: Officials at 
 
SIPDIS 
the Commerce Ministry likewise told EconOff November 23 there 
is still no word on a likely successor to Sunaidi, whose 
duties are currently being handled by the Under Secretary for 
Administration and Financial Affairs at the Ministry.  End 
comment.) 
9. (SBU) Again applying his economic expertise, Sunaidi plans 
to achieve greater efficiencies in the Sports Ministry\'s 
work.  He admits that its cadre of 400 employees, working out 
of a somewhat dilapidated 8-story building near the Central 
Business District, is more than necessary.  Rather than 
reducing their number (a feat he termed problematic), he 
intends to put them to more productive use.  He also argued 
that the 30 government-funded athletic clubs in the country 
are not sustainable.  He believes it would be more economical 
to reduce their number to 15 and simply transport people to 
the remaining venues, which would then get a larger share of 
financial support. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) Sunaidi\'s energy and intellect has made him in 
recent years a top candidate to become minister.  In just his 
first month on the job, he has done everything to reinforce 
that view.  Sunaidi\'s leadership undeniably affords us a key 
opportunity to expand our youth engagement through the medium 
of sports, as we happened to do with the Georgetown 
University basketball players.  We plan to work closely with 
him in further exploiting such chances.

1. (SBU) In a November 24 telcon, the MFA Under Secretary\'s 
Political Affairs Director, Humaid al-Maani, informed Pol/E 
Chief that, for the time being, neither Minister Responsible 
for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi nor Minister of National 
Economy (and de facto Finance Minister) Ahmed bin Abdulnabi 
Macki are likely to attend the Rabat FFF.  MFA Under 
Secretary Sayyid Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi and National 
 
SIPDIS 
Economy Secretary General (Minister Rank) Mohammed bin Nasser 
al-Khusaibi are instead slated to represent Oman in the 
ministerial sessions.  Al-Maani indicated that he and a 
representative from the Ministry of Social Development (which 
handles NGO affairs) and the Ministry of Education were 
likely also to attend, as well as possibly another official 
from the Ministry of National Economy (to cover business and 
finance dialogues).  Pol/E Chief emphasized that it would be 
unfortunate if neither Bin Alawi or Macki could attend in 
light of Secretaries Powell and Snow\'s planned attendance, to 
which al-Maani replied that his information was preliminary 
and possibly subject to change before December 10. 
 
2. (SBU) Al-Maani appreciated contact information Pol/E Chief 
was able to provide concerning the civil society dialogue and 
business dialogue components of the preparatory sessions, but 
expressed disappointment that, to his knowledge, Omanis have 
not been involved in either effort thus far.  (Note: An Omani 
businessman was invited to one of the initial business 
dialogue meetings but did not attend.  End note.)  He hoped 
that the Omani delegation during the Rabat FFF would be able 
to contact the relevant parties to ensure Oman was not 
excluded in future from those proceedings.  In a final note, 
though the Moroccan Embassy has not yet formally provided the 
MFA with information on which states were invited to attend 
the Rabat FFF, al-Maani was encouraged by informal 
indications that states such as Syria, Iran, Pakistan and 
Libya were or will be invited.  Such a measure was suggested 
by the Omani FM in a letter to Secretary Powell in October. 
Pol/E Chief emphasized that Morocco, as host, was responsible 
for issuing invitations, and that future participation in the 
Forum was designed to be flexible.

2.  (SBU)  The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core 
Emergency Action Committee (\"EAC\") November 27 to review both 
the Embassy\'s security posture following the local weekend 
and preparations for the U.S. Marine Corps Birthday Ball. 
The meeting opened with a discussion on the local security

 Likewise, the EAC noted no new threat reporting specific to 
Oman, and concurred that there have been no substantive 
changes in previously reported assessments of the security 
and threat environment.  Members of the EAC cited no security 
incidents among their staffs or family members over the 
weekend, and CONS confirmed that there were no security 
incidents or security-related queries from the private

3.  (C)  Pursuant to reftel B, RSO led a review of security 
preparations for the 229th U.S. Marine Corps Birthday Ball, 
to be held at the InterContinental Muscat on December 9. 
Security for the event will include extensive uniformed and 
plain-clothed Royal Oman Police (ROP) coverage in and around 
the venue, as well as EOD support and the enforcement of a no

1. (U) This is an action request for IO/T and NEA/APRI - 
please see para 4. 
 
2. (U) As reported ref A, Oman is lobbying for its Permanent 
Representative at UNESCO, Dr. Musa bin Jaffar bin Hassan, to 
be elected to the presidency of the 33rd session of the 
UNESCO General Conference in 2005.  To that end, Oman 
recently played host to a 36-member Circle of Delegates from 
UNESCO, headed by current General Conference President Amb. 
Michael Omolewa (Nigeria) and Circle of Delegates President 
Amb. Hector Villarroel (Philippines).  While the Circle of 
Delegates toured various Omani cultural and heritage sites as 
part of a bonding process for UNESCO PermReps, the Omanis 
clearly put forth their best effort to burnish the 
Sultanate\'s case for winning the General Conference 
presidency.  The delegation was also received by the Omani 
Ministers of Heritage and Culture, National Economy, and 
Education. 
 
3. (U) During a local press conference, the UNESCO delegation 
cited its desire to promote Dr. Musa\'s candidacy as a prime 
motivation in visiting Oman.  As widely covered by the Omani 
press, several PermReps joined Amb. Omolewa in expressing 
confidence that Dr. Musa bin Hassan will be the next 
president.  Dr. Musa and the Somali PermRep both indicated 
that the Arab region backed the Omani as consensus candidate. 
 (Note: Yemen held the General Conference presidency during 
the Arab block\'s last rotation in 1993.) 
 
4. (SBU) Action Request: Ref B indicated that the USG was 
inclined to support Oman\'s candidacy for the 2005 General 
Conference presidency.  Given past Omani support for various 
U.S. candidates, the Embassy would like to respond formally 
to the Foreign Ministry\'s March 1 diplomatic note soliciting 
USG support.  Please provide guidance on the USG position.

1. The lead editorial in the government-owned Arabic daily \"Oman\" 
on November 29 was entitled \"The Iraqi Elections\": 
 
\"The election in Iraq can be seen as a bottleneck, beyond which 
the country may be able to rebuild itself under the sheltering 
umbrella of a permanent constitution and representative 
government.  Iraq\'s interests are of paramount concern, and the 
difficult aspects of the election must not be neglected.  There 
should be a reasoned analysis of the issues, free from special 
interests or personal desires.  Seventeen political parties and 
civil organizations requested the postponement of the election; 
this request should be seriously considered, because it remains 
such a vital event for Iraqis.  The election should be a step 
toward peace, stability, and national unity.  A successful 
election will pave the way for Iraq to return to the 
international community, and regain its position as a vital 
player in the region and in the world as a whole.\"

2. Essa bin Mohammed Al-Zadjali, owner and editor-in-chief of the 
English daily \"Times of Oman\" and Arabic daily \"Al-Shabiba,\" 
wrote an editorial that appeared in both newspapers on November 
28 entitled, \"Colin Powell: The Last Of The Moderates\": 
 
\"The resignation of Secretary of State Colin Powell has met with 
conflicting reactions both inside the U.S. and in the world at 
large.  Powell stood tall in the administration because he chose 
a moderate style in running U.S. foreign policy over the last 
four years.  Obviously, this moderate stance created many 
confrontations between Powell and some of the hawks on the Bush 
team.  His policy of dialogue was often obstructed and countered 
by such senior officials as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and 
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.  Powell was the last 
moderate in the Bush administration.  He outlined a complete map 
for U.S. foreign policy that gained wide acceptance throughout 
the world.  U.S. foreign policy during the second term of the 
Bush presidency will remain an area of concern for U.S. allies 
abroad.\"

3. Another editorial appeared in \"Oman\" on November 26 entitled 
\"Syria\'s Vision\": 
 
\"After meeting with President Bashar al-Asad, United Nations 
Middle East envoy Terje Roed-Larsen confirmed that Syria is ready 
to negotiate with Israel without preconditions.  This surely 
indicates the vision and foresight of the Syrian leadership, for 
Syria has been trying to redefine its relationships with other 
countries, particularly Lebanon.  Syria\'s willingness to talk 
would appear to remove any pretexts for the Israelis to refuse to 
sit at the negotiating table.  However, the Israelis immediately 
belittled the announcement, saying it was merely an effort to 
curry favor with the United States.\"

Failed Conference 
----------------- 
 
4. Privately-owned Arabic daily \"Al-Watan\" carried an editorial 
on November 24 entitled \"The Sharm Al-Shaykh Conference\": 
 
\"The participants in the Sharm Al-Shaykh conference failed to 
address two important issues: how to deal with the superpower 
that invaded Iraq, and how to agree upon a legitimate plan to 
secure that superpower\'s withdrawal from the country.  Because of 
this failure, the Americans will once again get their way.  The 
participants in the conference appeared intent on avoiding any 
mention of the invasion, as if there were no occupying forces in 
Iraq.\"

Democracy In Action

5. An Egyptian writer, Dr. Abdul Aziz Hamooda, contributed an op- 
ed piece to \"Oman\" on November 23 under the headline \"America The 
Beautiful\": 
\"Let me assure you that I am not so blinded that I cannot detect 
the weak points of the American democratic system.  However, I 
refuse to reject the American model as a whole, since its 
stability has lasted for more than 100 years and has made America 
into an economic, political, and cultural superpower.  Despite 
all the negative aspects of the American model of democracy, the 
entire world witnessed a happy American election on November 2. 
U.S. presidents do not receive 90%, 80%, or even 60% of the vote; 
President Bush received 51% and his opponent 48%.  Millions of 
people in the third world saw American voters heading to the 
polls without fear.  I have personally witnessed a father and son 
voting for one candidate, and a mother and daughter voting for 
another candidate, without threatening the unity of the family.\"

SUBJECT: EFFORT TO LAUNCH OMAN\'S FIRST HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) An aspiring activist intent on establishing Oman\'s 
first human rights center has been invited to discuss his 
proposal with the Ministry of Social Development.  In an 
effort to obtain government registration, Abdullah bin Salem 
al-Barami solicited the Embassy for support, saying that the 
public\'s lack of awareness and understanding of their civil 
rights demands the establishment of such an organization. 
End Summary. 
 
------------ 
CAN WE TALK? 
------------ 
 
2. (SBU) An aspiring human rights activist, Mr. Abdullah bin 
Salem al-Barami, wrote an impassioned letter to the 
Ambassador requesting assistance in establishing a human 
rights center in Oman.  Al-Barami, a businessman and military 
veteran who hails from Oman\'s southern Dhofar region, said 
that \"as the one who saved Europe from the barbarism of the 
Nazis and Fascists,\" America needs to present its \"beautiful\" 
image to the Arab and Muslim world.  Furthermore, al-Barami 
said that assisting Oman in establishing a human rights 
center would be serving mutual interests and strengthening 
friendly ties between the two countries.  While al-Barami is 
currently on the board of directors of his family\'s 
successful business venture, Al-Barami Group of Companies, he 
appears serious in taking on this additional mantle. 
 
--------------------- 
OUTLINING HR CONCERNS 
--------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Emboffs met with al-Barami October 23 to discuss his 
proposal for establishing a human rights center in Oman.  He 
spoke about the many injustices he perceives in Omani society 
and the public\'s lack of awareness of their civil rights. 
His criticisms included the \"just for show\" Majlis al-Shura 
(Consultative Council), discrimination in the workforce, 
restricted civil rights (example of government approval for 
Omanis to marry non-Omani citizens), controlled press (no 
critical reporting and limited newspaper selection), the 
problem of elitism (according to al-Barami 50 families 
monopolize the Omani economy), and the overcrowded 
universities. 
 
4. (SBU) On the subject of universities, al-Barami appeared 
personally offended by the USD20 million pricetag for the 
construction of Sultan Qaboos University, a school that 
accommodates only 2000 students per year.  He also criticized 
the cost of Dhofar University (DU).  The only university in 
the region, DU barely accommodates 1000 students and charges 
over USD7500 per year.  (Note:  The average cost of tuition 
in Oman is USD7500 for most private schools.  End Note.) 
Al-Barami said that 40,000 to 50,000 students graduate 
secondary school each year with ambitions of furthering their 
education.  He asked, \"How can we expect families to afford 
sending even one kid to university?\"  More importantly, 
al-Barami said that the fundamental lack of access to higher 
education paves the way for terrorism.  Young students will 
be listening to \"fundamentalist\" rhetoric instead of 
university lectures. 
 
--------------------------- 
MINISTRY WILLING TO DISCUSS 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Al-Barami seemed convinced that without vocal 
support from the United States, the Ministry of Social 
Development will deny registration to a human rights 
organization.  Emboffs reminded al-Barami that it is usually 
a lengthy and tedious process for any non-governmental 
organization (NGO) to become registered in Oman.  While the 
U.S. clearly supports human rights efforts, al-Barami he may 
find it difficult to garner material support for an 
organization that does not formally exist.  Emboffs also 
offered suggestions to assist al-Barami in pursuing his 
ambition, including visiting successful local NGOs, reaching 
out to other embassies that also support human rights, 
contacting international organizations, and, most 
importantly, applying for registration with the Ministry of 
Social Development.  Many NGOs in the process of seeking 
registration are still able to carry out substantial work in 
their fields. 
 
6. (SBU) Al-Barami notified us November 28 that, in response 
to his letter, the Ministry of Social Development has invited 
al-Barami to Muscat to discuss his proposal.  Poloff will 
meet again with al-Barami and facilitate meetings with local 
NGOs who have been through the lengthy registration process. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) Al-Barami is a serious and determined individual who 
is articulating some commonly heard complaints.  Apparently 
around 50 years old, he is a veteran of the provincial guard 
forces the Sultan created to battle the communist-backed 
Dhofar rebellion in the 1970\'s, as well as of the Royal Air 
Force of Oman.  He indicated that he was presenting his 
proposal to us on behalf of like-minded colleagues in Dhofar 
and elsewhere in the Sultanate, primarily composed of former 
military and professional people (doctors, engineers, 
educators and business people).  His ambition to create a 
human rights center strikes us as sincere, and we will 
closely monitor further developments and, where appropriate, 
provide advice and assistance.

     I may have useful information on Usma Bin Mohammad 
     Bin Ladin.  He is in the area of K5 or K6 of your 
     map, he has not moved very far in the past few 
     months.  He is currently intending to be there 
     through the next few months.  He is in a light 
     green colored house with shutters.  It is one of 
     many in the neighborhood.  All are connected by 
     gardens, alley type walkways and driveways, almost 
     a compound of sorts.  It is at the base of a small 
     mountain.  This mountain is a tunnel to freedom for 
     him.  It is also part of a historical site and 
     ruins that is above his underground city that he 
     has in many places.  He has provisions for months 
     for himself.  ALL PERSON\'S in the area are trained, 
     not necessarily with weapons but protection of their 
     leader-Usa Bin Mohammad Bin Ladin.  It is suggested 
     that entering from the opposite side of the mountain 
     would be best.  A direct approach will not work, 
     blending in will be timely and very difficult, no one 
     is trusted.  The person surrounding him are loyal 
     family, even the smallest. 
 
     thank you, edna

2.  (SBU)  The Deputy Chief of Mission chaired a meeting of

3.  (SBU)  Prior to concluding the meeting, RSO reiterated 
that members of the EAC should continue reinforcing to both 
their staffs and family members the need for vigilance 
regarding all aspects of personal security, including the 
need to maintain a low profile and to remain unpredictable. 
RSO also re-emphasized the importance of immediately 
reporting suspicious activity or security-related incidents, 
especially those involving suspected surveillance, to Post

4.  (S/NF)   The EAC concluded that there has been no 
substantive change in the local security environment since 
the last meeting held on November 27 (reftel), and that the 
Embassy\'s already heightened security posture and FPCON 
remain appropriate.  Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely 
aware of the need to monitor both the regional and local 
security and threat environments, and is prepared to take the 
necessary countermeasures should changes to either occur. 
DCM, RSO, RMAS, P/E, CONS, DAO, OMC (USDR), and ECA

SUBJECT: OMAN ONLINE: TOPICS IN FREEDOM 
 
 
1. Summary:  The Omani Internet chat room \"Sablat al-Arab\" -- or 
simply \"Al-Sablah\" -- is the liveliest and most comprehensive 
Arabic-language forum for political and social discourse in the 
country, touching on issues and personalities rarely addressed in 
the conventional media.  While not totally free, nor wholly 
reflective of Omani public opinion, Al-Sablah nevertheless offers 
a worthwhile window into the hot topics and unvarnished views of 
the day.  This edition of Oman Online contains the following 
topics: 
 
--- Proposed Free Trade Agreement Between The U.S. And Oman 
--- Freedom Of The Press 
--- New Oman Journalists\' Association 
 
End summary. 
 
---------------- 
Freedom To Trade 
---------------- 
 
2. The proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the United 
States and the Sultanate of Oman generated a large number of 
postings among Al-Sablah members, particularly with regards to 
its potential effect on the economic condition of Omani citizens. 
A few commentators viewed the FTA in a favorable light; one 
observed, \"America did not select these countries [FTA partners] 
randomly.  Rather, there were certain criteria for joining an 
FTA, such as security, stability, potential tourism, and 
political harmony with neighboring countries.\"  Another FTA 
supporter noted, \"America seeks to encourage vibrant economic 
competition within the Gulf, and this competition could lead an 
economic revival.\" 
 
3.  However, the majority of responses viewed the FTA with 
suspicion and skepticism.  \"We do not believe that America wants 
to improve the lives of GCC citizens.  The whole agreement is 
nothing more than propaganda, designed to further open foreign 
markets for American products,\" wrote one member.  Opined 
another, \"These agreements only serve to ensure America\'s 
presence in the region.\"  Another asked, \"How will Oman benefit 
from this agreement?  Are we going to export our products to the 
United States?  Do the Americans need Omani products, and vice- 
versa?\"  One of the more impassioned responses read, \"This 
agreement is killing our dignity, and we do not support or desire 
any partnership with people who are killing our brothers in Iraq 
and Palestine.  Why don\'t the Arab countries unite to create a 
huge economic entity, which could overcome the abuses of 
foreigners?\" 
 
----------------- 
Freedom Of Speech 
----------------- 
 
4. Another hot topic in Al-Sablah concerned freedom of the press 
in Oman, related to recent rumors about the government\'s supposed 
\"ban\" on two Omani writers from publishing or appearing on 
television.  The author of the topic wrote, \"The Sultan issued a 
royal decree allowing the establishment of private media outlets, 
but what does the law really say?  Does it give us more freedom 
to say and write what we feel?  Is this freedom actually 
practiced, or is it merely ink on paper?\" 
 
5.  Nearly all the responses doubted the existence of genuine 
media freedom.  One contributor claimed, \"The laws concerning the 
media have not really changed for the past twenty years.  The 
only reason we are talking about this is because of the scandal 
concerning the banning of the two Omani writers, and we had to 
learn about the ban from regional newspapers!\"  One hopeful 
member opined that \"The new law might make us able to criticize 
the defects of the Majlis Al-Shura (Consultative Council) and 
Majlis Al-Dawla (State Council),\" but most respondents agreed 
with the writer who penned, \"The situation will never change in 
Oman until the people running this country have been changed from 
top to bottom.\" 
 
------------------- 
Freedom To Assemble 
------------------- 
 
6. On a related note, Al-Sablah members also reacted to the news 
that the Ministry of Social Development officially approved the 
registration of the new Oman Journalists\' Association.  Many 
forum participants questioned the role of such an association, 
fearing the heavy hand of the government.  \"It is going to be run 
by the government since we have heard that the Board of Directors 
will be appointed by the Ministry of Information,\" wrote one

between the Association and the Ministry of Information; indeed, 
the Association will be a continuation of it.\"  Other members 
questioned the Association\'s relationship with the extant Press 
Club, which is part of the Ministry of Information.  Moreover, 
some forum members felt that membership in the Association will 
be restricted:  \"The Association should be a private, non-profit 
organization for all writers and journalists.  However, if you 
want to join the Association, you must obtain permission from the 
Ministry of Information.  How is that free?\"

SUBJECT: FOREIGNERS ALLOWED TO OWN PROPERTY IN OMAN 
 
1. Summary: A recent decision by the Omani government 
allows non-Omanis to own real estate in tourist complexes 
licensed by the government. The decision supports 
government efforts to promote investment and attract 
foreign capital.  Several prominent projects are lining 
up residential clients to take advantage of this new 
legislation.  Final implementing regulations are expected 
by the end of the year.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Land Rush in Muscat? 
-------------------- 
 
2. The Ministry of Housing, Electricity and Water (MHEW) 
issued a decision in mid-November to allow non-Omanis to 
own real estate \"for housing or investment purposes\" 
within comprehensive, complete, and government-licensed 
tourist complexes. Such complexes do not yet exist, 
although a number are in the advanced planning stages. 
The MHEW and Ministry of Tourism expect to complete final 
implementing regulations by the end of 2004. 
 
----------------------- 
Broad Benefits Outlined 
----------------------- 
 
3. The MHEW decision included several provisions to 
regulate foreign ownership as follows: 
 
-- Foreigners, expatriates, and corporate entities will 
be allowed to own real estate in designated tourism- 
related areas, for residential or investment purposes. 
 
-- Ownership of the real estate (if it is a land plot) 
shall return to the government if construction on the 
plot is not completed within four years. In this case, 
the owner is compensated at the purchase price or price 
of an auction, whichever is lower. The MHEW may extend 
the time allowance for a maximum of two more years. 
 
-- The owner will have the right to sell the real estate, 
whether the property is developed (e.g., a residential 
unit), or land ready for development.  The owners will 
pay 10 percent of the sale price to the Ministry of 
Tourism in the former case, and 20 percent in the latter 
case. 
 
-- In case of owner\'s death, the property shall be passed 
to heirs as per the laws of the country of citizenship of 
the deceased. Otherwise, ownership shall return to the 
Omani government in case of no claim of inheritance 
within five years of death. 
 
-- The owner and his/her immediate family members will be 
granted residency status in the Sultanate under a 
separate visa category that will be introduced.  No time 
restriction will be applied to this residency, according 
to Tourism Ministry officials. 
 
-- The owner also retains the right to dispose of 
property according to local laws in case of a legal 
sentence of deportation. 
 
-- If the property is confiscated for public interest, 
the owner shall have the right to compensation without 
hindering his/her right to own another property. 
 
-- The Ministerial decision included provisions for the 
establishment of a licensing committee for tourist 
complexes, which will be assigned by the Ministry of 
Tourism. Another committee set up by the MHEW will be 
responsible for setting up auctions to deal with the 
above-mentioned cases.

Comment 
------- 
 
4. This long-awaited announcement clearly aims at 
promoting foreign investment and high profile tourism. 
Several prominent projects, such as the much-ballyhooed 
\"The Wave\" tourist complex and a new Golf and Country 
Club resort in Muscat, were relying on this decision in 
order to book advance sales of villas and apartments to 
prospective customers. Moving from tight restrictions on 
real estate investment to broad liberalization on this 
scale will be tricky, and all eyes will be on the 
government as the implementing regulations and by-laws 
are established in the coming weeks. The true investment 
prize - commercial real estate - is still off-limits to 
foreign buyers.  While there is no reason to expect a 
massive land rush anytime soon, the conditions are 
increasingly promising for expatriates seeking to own 
real estate in Oman.

1.  (SBU)  Summary: The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the 
core Emergency Action Committee December 4 to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture following the local weekend. 
Members of the EAC noted no new threat reporting specific to 
Oman, and concluded that there have been no substantive 
changes in the local security environment since the last 
meeting.  Accordingly, the EAC agreed that the Embassy\'s 
already heightened security posture and FPCON remain 
appropriate.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Security Environment 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core 
Emergency Action Committee (\"EAC\") December 4 to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture following the local weekend.  The 
meeting opened with a discussion of the local security 
situation, which the EAC continued to characterize as stable. 
 Likewise, the EAC noted no new threat reporting specific to 
Oman, and concurred that there have been no substantive 
changes in previously reported assessments of the security 
and threat environments.  Members of the EAC cited no 
security incidents among their staffs or family members over 
the weekend, and CONS confirmed that there were no security 
incidents or security-related queries from the private 
American citizen community. 
 
--------------- 
Upcoming Events 
--------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  The EAC focused their review of upcoming events on 
the visit of Vice President and Mrs. Cheney to Muscat on 
December 7.  Security for the visit is being closely 
coordinated with U.S. Secret Service advance agents and Omani 
government security personnel. 
 
4.  (C)  RSO also provided an update on security preparations 
for the 229th U.S. Marine Corps Birthday Ball, to be held at 
the InterContinental Muscat on December 9.  As previously 
reported, security for the event will include extensive 
uniformed and plain-clothed Royal Oman Police (ROP) coverage 
in and around the venue, as well as EOD support and the 
enforcement of a no parking zone.  Surveillance Detection 
Unit assets will also provide support.  While the EAC agreed 
that screening invited guests with proper identification was 
not necessary, the ROP, who will also provide access control 
for the duration of the event, will be prepared to physically 
screen guests as required.  RSO noted that the ROP remains 
responsive to the Embassy\'s security needs, as witnessed by 
the protective security coverage provided for The American 
International School of Muscat\'s holiday ball, held on 
December 2. 
 
----------------- 
Terrorist Tactics 
----------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  RSO briefly reviewed the contents of reftels A and 
C, regarding terrorist tactics.  RSO confirmed that 
appropriate security personnel and Embassy staff will be 
briefed as detailed in reftels. 
 
------------------- 
Sustained Vigilance 
------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  Prior to concluding the meeting, RSO reiterated 
that members of the EAC should continue reinforcing to both 
their staffs and family members the need for vigilance 
regarding all aspects of personal security, including the 
need to maintain a low profile and to remain unpredictable. 
RSO also re-emphasized the importance of immediately 
reporting suspicious activity or security-related incidents 
-- especially those involving suspected surveillance -- to 
Post One. 
-------------- 
EAC Conclusion 
-------------- 
7.  (S/NF)  The EAC concluded that there has been no 
substantive change in the local security environment since 
the last meeting held on December 1 (reftel B), and that the 
Embassy\'s FPCON and already heightened security posture 
remain appropriate.  Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely 
aware of the need to monitor both the regional and local 
security and threat environments, and is prepared to take the 
necessary countermeasures should changes to either occur. 
AMB, DCM, RSO, ARSO, RMAS, P/E, CONS, MGT, MSG, DAO, OMC 
(USDR), and ECA (USCENTAF) participated in the meeting, which 
was preceded by a meeting of the Visas Viper Committee.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Dutch Ambassador (EU Representative) 
reports having received no instructions from Brussels on 
quarterly BMENA coordination meetings with the U.S. (ref A). 
Furthermore, there will be no EU funds earmarked for Oman 
before 2007 at the earliest.  Only seven EU states have 
missions in Muscat, and each of them manages their limited 
assistance programs on a purely bilateral basis. 
Nevertheless, the Dutch will undertake to coordinate an EU-US 
meeting in the first quarter of 2005.  Prior consultations 
with the UK Embassy (the most BMENA-active local EU-member 
mission) revealed difficulties in securing funding and 
overcoming challenges dealing with the Omani bureaucracy. 
End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
European Disunion 
----------------- 
 
2. (U) Per ref B, Pol/E Chief met with the Dutch Ambassador 
(current EU representative in Oman) on December 1. 
Ambassador Annelies Boogaerdt reported having received no 
instructions from Brussels requesting EU-US coordination 
meetings.  As the chief representative of the 7 EU embassies 
in Oman (for the current Dutch and upcoming Luxembourg 
presidencies), however, she offered to organize future 
quarterly meetings beginning in early 2005 to coordinate 
European Union Strategic Partnership (EUSP) and MEPI programs 
at the deputies level.  Both Pol/E Chief and Ambassador 
Boogaerdt agreed to share outlines of current assistance 
programs in Oman for the next meeting. 
 
3. (SBU) Ambassador Boogaerdt noted that there are currently 
no EUSP funds for Oman from Brussels, nor any envisioned in 
the next two years.  Moreover, the EU pays more attention to 
its North African \"back yard\" rather than the distant Gulf. 
Consequently, Ambassador Boogaerdt continues to promote her 
modest Dutch assistance programs in Oman on a purely 
bilateral basis, as do the other resident European missions. 
She also said that her annual assistance budget (increasing 
threefold to $50,000 in 2005), and limited personnel, 
primarily support awareness and development programs in the 
health (HIV/AIDS) sector.  Encountering a similar obstacle as 
MEPI, Ambassador Boogaerdt said that Omani government prefers 
that the Dutch programs eschew the EUSP label. 
 
-------------------- 
UK\'s Limited Success 
-------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) EmbOffs conferred with UK Embassy colleagues on 
assistance programs in October, as part of an informal and 
irregular consultative process.  UK DCM and PolOff noted that 
they have no country-specific budget for Oman, but rather 
compete for regional projects on a case-by-case basis.  They 
had focused a number of programs on human resources 
development with both the Ministry of Manpower and the 
Ministry of Civil Service that have been bogged down in the 
Omani bureaucracy.  Discussions with the Omani Attorney 
General are ongoing on a needs assessment for training and 
technical assistance.  Whereas the USG has had a successful 
program (through IRI) of professional staff development at 
the Majlis al-Shura (Oman\'s elected quasi-legislature), the 
UK has succeeded in engaging Shura members on a peer level 
through a multi-party parliamentary group from the House of 
Commons.  The UK MPs have established a standing bilateral 
committee in the Commons chaired by MP Alan Duncan, and are 
considering offering clinics to Shura members on issues such 
as constituent relations and managing district offices.  Like 
the USG, the UK Embassy works with Omani civil society groups 
to help build their capacity. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) The EU missions in Muscat are limited both in 
number, size, and funding.  There appears to be little 
coordination re their bilateral assistance programs.  Like 
us, they seem to grapple with limited funding (often designed 
on a regional rather than country-specific basis), a shortage 
of staff with which to implement programs, and difficulties 
navigating a somewhat suspicious Omani bureaucracy.  We will 
encourage greater information sharing, ideally on a quarterly 
basis, but expect the European programs collectively to lag 
behind USG efforts in Oman.

Summary 
------- 
 
2. (C) A rising mid-level Omani commerce official recently 
described the rapid decline of the Omani textile industry, 
her experiences within the government, the ill-timed 
departure of the Commerce Under Secretary, and her positive 
experience visiting the United States on an International 
Visitor Program.  Exuding confidence and energy, she laments 
the lack of younger leadership at all levels of government in 
Oman.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Cutting Her Teeth in Industry, Textiles 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) During the course of an hour-long courtesy call, 
Econoff discussed various issues relating to bilateral trade 
and ministerial intrigue with Sheikha Khalfan al-Masheikhi, 
Director of the Industrial Development Department at the 
Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  Having worked her way 
through the ranks of her ministry for the better part of a 
decade, she gained valuable experience in dealing with local 
businesses and the economics of regulation.  She recalled one 
instance where she was proud of having recommended that a 
dairy factory be shut down due to lack of hygiene only to 
realize how she could of imposed fines and given the factory 
a timetable to implement changes before pulling the plug. 
4. (C) She now maintains responsibility for the textile 
sector in Oman, which she claims has been devastated by 
increasing costs and global competition.  Of 33 textile 
factories in the 1990s, only 15-16 are still operating.  She 
blames the high cost imposed by Omanization as the cause for 
the decline in competitiveness.  In discussions with her 
counterparts at the Ministry of Manpower, she was rebuffed in 
a proposal to mandate only 15 percent Omanization for the 
textile sector; instead, Manpower officials sought an 
increase to 45 percent.  She claims that U.S. free trade 
agreements with Bahrain, Jordan, and Morocco are cutting 
deeply into Omani competitiveness in the garment industry 
with their reduction in tariffs, a claim that we have heard 
from other contacts in the business community.   One of her 
overarching goals is for the Sultanate to adopt a written, 
transparent competition policy in line with WTO standards, 
which would allow Omani industry to compete without 
abandoning its multilateral commitments. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Protege of Former Under Secretary 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Ms. al-Masheikhi clearly misses Ali al-Sunaidi, her 
former colleague and mentor who departed his post as Under 
Secretary of Commerce and Industry when he was named Minister 
 
SIPDIS 
of Sports Affairs in October (ref A).  Al-Masheikhi claims 
that al-Sunaidi\'s departure was ill-timed and represents a 
\"waste of talent,\" given the many economic challenges facing 
Oman.  In her view, he would have been much better suited to 
take the helm at the Ministry of Manpower, or even the 
Commerce Ministry itself. 
 
------------- 
Red Tape Woes 
------------- 
 
6. (C) Al-Masheikhi scorns the \"old-school\" bureaucrats 
prevalent in the Omani government, who work out of routine 
instead of evincing duty or a sense of improving Oman.  She 
gives the older generation tremendous credit for \"building 
Oman in just 34 years,\" but she firmly believes it is time 
for the younger, Internet-savvy generation to take the reins. 
 Al-Masheihki claims that the current DG of Industry, Dr. 
Hamad al-Dhahab, fits the \"old school\" mold, and that the 
best \"new minds\" are occupying only marginal positions in the 
ministry and the government.  Even simple ideas take 
tremendous energy and initiative to succeed, such as her own 
\"Business Umbrella,\" a workshop series designed to foster 
leadership skills among budding entrepreneurs from across the 
Sultanate.  She completely revamped the program, which had 
been started by a predecessor but had languished from 
neglect.  Today, all invitations for the Business Umbrella 
are delivered electronically, and al-Masheikhi has succeeded 
in organizing major teambuilding exercises across the 
country.  Still, she constantly faces scrutiny from superiors 
who question her unorthodox style.  In one instance, she 
tried to help a low-income woman from the Dhofar region 
package and market her incense on the margins of a 
conference, earning her a slap on the wrist for doing 
something outside of normal \"procedures.\" 
--------------------------------------- 
Thoughts on Tourism, Women as Ministers 
--------------------------------------- 
7. (C) Al-Masheihki also spoke about her recent disagreements 
with actions to spur tourism in Oman.  The extensive 
renovation of forts and other historical sites in the 
Sultanate gall her most.  \"Why are they restoring things to 
make them look new?  Why not make small improvements or 
preventive maintenance, and then let people come see history, 
like they do in Egypt and other places?\" she laments.  She 
believes that the Wahiba Sands (a popular desert destination 
some 180 km southeast of Muscat) could be enhanced greatly by 
bringing people to see traditional handicraft markets run by 
women in Sharqiyah.  As for promoting tourism from abroad, 
al-Masheikhi insists that institutions such as OCIPED (Omani 
Center for Investment Promotion and Export Development) have 
not fulfilled their mission to effectively market Oman 
overseas.  Sounding off on the recent promotion of several 
women to ministerial rank, al-Masheikhi criticized the idea 
of putting female ministers in place who lack the background 
or experience for their jobs.  She is concerned that they are 
being set up for failure, which will provide fodder for the 
critics who claim women cannot handle ministerial jobs. 
(Comment: This remark appears mostly directed at the 
surprising October elevation of the young college literature 
professor Dr. Sharifah al-Yahyai to the post of Minister of 
Social Development - refs B and C.  End comment.) 
 
----------------------------------- 
IV Program: Broadening Her Horizons 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Sheihka al-Masheikhi credits her International 
Visitor experience with providing a close-up look at American 
society.  From August to September 2004, Ms. al-Masheikhi 
participated in a program entitled \"Young Economic & Business 
Leaders: Enhancing Leadership Potential.\" She noted with 
interest the difference between Texas, where people seemed to 
take a genuine interest in her background and her modest 
Islamic dress, and Washington, DC, where she claimed people 
were absorbed with their work and seemed in a perpetual 
hurry.  She enjoyed seeing rural America, which she compared 
to the Omani interior in terms of lifestyle and pace of life, 
and she sincerely hopes to pursue a Masters or Ph.D. program 
at the University of Texas should the opportunity present 
itself. 
 
---------------- 
Biographic Notes 
---------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Sheikha Khalfan al-Masheikhi was born in 1969 in 
Ibra, located in the eastern Sharqiyah region of Oman.  She 
currently serves as Director of the Industrial Planning 
Department of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry 
(1998-present).  Previous positions in the Ministry include 
stints as Planning Researcher (1997-98); Acting Section Head, 
Chemical & Petroleum Products Specification Department 
(1994-97); and Chemical Specification Specialist (1994).  A 
graduate of public schools, she went on to a distinguished 
academic career at Sultan Qaboos University, where she 
received her BA in Science (Chemistry major, Physics and 
Mathematics minor) in 1993.  She has participated in numerous 
workshops, including two sponsored by the WTO (2000, 2003). 
She has two daughters and possesses extremely strong English 
skills.  Her mother comes from the prominent al-Harthy tribe 
in Sharqiyah. 
 
10. (SBU) In her nominating cable for the International 
Visitor program, her current work is outlined: \"Ms. 
Al-Masheikhi conducts training programs for Omani 
entrepreneurs in Oman and abroad, leading Omani business 
delegations on international visits to learn new industrial 
management techniques to apply in Oman.  Ms. Al-Masheikhi 
also provides advisory services to entrepreneurs on 
initiating new businesses, licensing, registration, and 
business incentives.  Ms. al-Masheikhi also plans and 
implements the annual industrial promotion plan, and monitors 
and manages the agreement between the Sultanate of Oman and 
the U.S. on garment exports.  In addition, she drafts and 
edits television programs that promote Omani products under 
the theme, \'Our First Choice, Omani Products.\'\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (C) Al-Masheikhi has no problem speaking her mind, and 
she obviously brings energy and ambition to her decidedly 
non-descript mid-level job.  Her comments about a 
generational divide within the Commerce Ministry have been 
echoed in other government institutions as well.  With the 
transfer of Ali al-Sunaidi out of the Commerce Ministry, we 
will seek to cultivate relationships with proactive and 
dynamic figures such as al-Masheikhi as we move forward 
briskly in our economic engagement with Oman.

\"On the occasion of world AIDS day, Arab countries are reviewing

needs to be done to confront and contain this deadly disease. One

\"For a lesson in the dangers of trying to change the Middle East, 
look no further than France.  Napoleon went to Egypt, declaring 
that he would change Middle Eastern culture, but despite his 
efforts the country remained the same.  Many years later, France 
embarked on a similar adventure in Algeria; but even after the 
deaths of one million Algerians, the country retained its local 
culture.  When the United States came to Iraq with visions of 
establishing a democracy, France opposed the intervention and 
came out against the principle of imposing culture by force. 
France learned from its previous lessons.  In the history of the 
Middle East, invaders and colonialists have occupied certain 
countries for hundreds of years, but they could never wipe out 
the original culture.  If change is to take place, it must occur 
naturally with the development and evolution of its people, 
rather than being imposed by force from the outside.\"

3. The lead editorial in the government-owned Arabic daily \"Oman\" 
on December 5 was entitled \"The Omani Media And Its Role In

\"The Omani media is being recognized for the important role it 
plays in Oman. Domestically, the media supports and protects the 
sense of heritage and identity within Oman, and it also plays a 
supportive role in local development initiatives. 
Internationally, the Omani media is regarded as a positive force 
for the spread of peace, international understanding, and human

Summary

1.  (SBU)  Summary: The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the 
Emergency Action Committee December 6 to review the Embassy\'s 
security posture following reports that Consulate General 
Jeddah had been attacked.  After reviewing the known facts 
about the attack, members of the EAC noted there was no new 
threat reporting specific to Oman, and concluded that there 
have been no substantive changes in the local security 
environment.  The EAC did, however, agree to reconvene 
tomorrow, December 7, to discuss updates on the Jeddah 
attack.  End Summary.

Security Environment 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the Emergency 
Action Committee (\"EAC\") December 6 to review the Embassy\'s 
security posture following reports that gunmen had attacked 
Consulate General Jeddah.  The meeting opened with a review 
of the known facts, derived from both official and press 
reporting.  RSO advised that immediately following initial 
reports of the attack, he requested augmented Royal Oman 
Police (ROP) coverage at both the Chancery and in residential 
neighborhoods; RMAS advised that they are in the process of 
requesting the same via their Omani government counterparts. 
Marine Security Guard, Surveillance Detection Unit, and local 
guard personnel were also briefed accordingly.  RSO confirmed 
that details on the Jeddah attack will be briefed to U.S. 
Secret Service advance personnel preparing for the upcoming 
 
SIPDIS 
visit of Vice President and Mrs. Cheney to Muscat on December 
7. 
 
------------------------- 
Impact on Upcoming Events 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  The EAC again reviewed security preparations for 
the 229th U.S. Marine Corps Birthday Ball, to be held at the 
InterContinental Muscat on December 9.  The EAC agreed to 
move forward with the event, which will receive extensive ROP 
support.  RSO reiterated the ROP\'s responsiveness to the 
Embassy\'s security needs, as witnessed by the protective 
security coverage provided for a recent event sponsored by 
The American International School of Muscat. 
 
-------------- 
EAC Conclusion 
-------------- 
 
5.  (S/NF)  After carefully reviewing the known facts about 
the attack in Jeddah, EAC members noted no new threat 
reporting specific to Oman, and concurred that there have 
been no substantive changes in previously reported 
assessments of the local security and threat environments 
(reftel B).  Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely aware of 
the need to monitor both the regional and local security 
situation, and is prepared to take the necessary 
countermeasures should changes to either occur.  AMB, DCM, 
RSO, ARSO, RMAS, P/E, PAO, CONS, MGT, MSG, DAO, OMC (USDR), 
and ECA (USCENTAF) participated in the meeting. 
 
6.  (SBU)  The EAC will reconvene tomorrow, December 7, to 
discuss updates on the Jeddah attack.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) AES Barka, a subsidiary of U.S.-based AES 
Corporation, recently floated 11.2 million shares of its 
capital for public underwriting by Omanis and Omani 
companies. The shares correspond to 35 percent of its paid- 
up capital, and the preliminary response to this IPO has 
been extremely positive for the company.  AES Barka is the 
largest independent power and water generation company in 
Oman and will be listed on the Muscat stock exchange.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------ 
Going Public 
------------ 
 
2. (U) AES Barka, a consortium between the AES Corporation 
(headquartered in Arlington, VA) and local Omani partners, 
floated 35 percent of its shares on November 21.  This 
initial public offering (IPO), which will close on December 
20, falls under the Project Founders\' Agreement with the 
Omani government calling for an IPO within four years of 
establishment. 
 
------------------------- 
Background on AES in Oman 
------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) A government tender for the Barka power plant 
project opened in April 2000 and was won by a consortium 
between AES Oasis (a subsidiary of the AES Corporation) and 
the local Multi Technologies, the investment arm of the 
Suhail Bahwan Group (ref B). The two partners formed a 
company (AES Barka) to manage the project on a Build, Own 
and Operate (BOO) basis with AES owning $70.72 million USD 
(85 percent of paid up capital) and Multi Technologies 
owning $12.48 million USD (15 percent). The BOO arrangement 
gives the company the option to renew its initial 15-year 
contract period for an additional 10 years, with no 
obligation to sell its shares to the government.  In the 
long run, AES Barka officials believe that the Omani 
government will move toward a merchant market for 
electricity (i.e., serving and charging customers directly, 
without selling to the Omani government as an intermediary), 
and they envision such a move will happen within the 25-year 
scope of the Founders\' Agreement the company signed. 
 
4. (SBU) After initial contractual difficulties that were 
resolved with Embassy assistance (ref A), the Barka power 
plant commenced operation in June 2003.  The total project 
cost was $415 million USD, which included a $332 million USD 
loan from a group of financial institutions.  The project 
has been profitable from day one, which undoubtedly is 
another attractive feature of the company for prospective 
investors.  It has already distributed $22.62 million USD of 
profit as dividends to shareholders during its first year in 
business, and the company\'s chief financial officer told 
Econoff recently the company hopes to distribute another $12 
million USD by the end of 2004. 
 
---------------- 
Joining the List 
---------------- 
 
5. (U) Following completion of the underwriting process, the 
company will be listed on the Muscat Securities Market early 
next year alongside two existing independent power 
companies, United Power managing the Manah Power Plant 
(operated by Belgium\'s Trachtebel), and the Al-Kamil Power 
Company (operated by the UK\'s International Power). 
 
--------- 
Road Show 
--------- 
 
6. (SBU) AES Barka officials are seeking maximum visibility 
for their company during this IPO phase, so the top brass 
are fanning out across Oman to drum up additional investor 
interest in five locations outside the capital. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) This IPO, limited to Omani citizens and companies, 
is already attracting strong demand based on the success of 
AES Barka\'s initial year of operation.  Local analysts 
believe that two factors are at play: high liquidity in the 
marketplace (investors are flush), and a lack of alternative 
investment opportunities in the Sultanate.  Market 
capitalization in Muscat has not grown as dramatically as in 
most GCC capitals, but the trend is decidedly upward.  Such 
IPO\'s are helping to fuel an influx of capital into the MSM, 
and in the process overcome a lingering public skepticism 
over capital market dealings since the market crash of late 
1997.  The biggest and most anticipated IPO should occur 
early next year, when state telecoms giant Omantel floats 30 
percent of its shares.  By that point, it should be much 
clearer whether the current capital surge is just another 
bubble or part of a sustainable growth trend in Oman.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary: The Ambassador convened the Emergency 
Action Committee December 7 to review updated reporting on 
yesterday\'s terrorist attack against Consulate General 
Jeddah.  After a careful review of the facts surrounding the 
attack, the EAC discussed existing countermeasures and 
avenues for further mitigating the threat of a similar 
attack.  EAC members noted no new threat reporting specific 
to Oman, and concurred that there have been no substantive 
changes in previously reported assessments of the local 
security and threat environments (reftel B).  The EAC will 
continue to meet and report regularly.  End Summary. 
 
------ 
Review 
------ 
 
2.  (C)  The Ambassador convened the Emergency Action 
Committee (\"EAC\") December 7 to review updated reporting on 
yesterday\'s terrorist attack against Consulate General 
Jeddah.  The meeting opened with a discussion of the known 
facts, including the contents of reftel A.  The EAC further 
discussed existing countermeasures, such as operating 
procedures for the Chancery vehicle entrance\'s double set of 
anti-ram vehicle gates and Delta barriers, and their control 
via both Post One and a 15-minute FEBR local guard booth.  To 
mitigate the threat to security, motorpool, facilities, and 
other staff performing functions in or adjacent to the 
motorpool, which lies between the aforementioned sets of 
gates/barriers, the EAC agreed on the necessity of creating 
an alternate safehaven in the carpenter shop (accessible via 
the motorpool).  The alternate safehaven would provide cover 
for staff who, based on the circumstances, might be caught in 
the motorpool between the two sets of barriers an be unable 
to escape attack through the Chancery hard-line.  The EAC 
further agreed on the necessity of scheduling an Embassy-wide 
combined intruder/safehaven drill. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  As previously reported (reftel B), immediately 
following the attack against Consulate General Jeddah, RSO 
requested ramped-up Royal Oman Police (ROP) coverage at both 
the Chancery and in residential neighborhoods; RMAS did the 
same via their Omani government counterparts.  Marine 
Security Guard, Surveillance Detection Unit, and local guard 
personnel were also briefed accordingly. 
 
---- 
MSGQ 
---- 
 
4.  (C)  Specifically addressing the Marine Security Guard 
Quarters (MSGQ), a low-visibility, nondescript -- but not 
unknown -- residence located in a residential neighborhood 
approximately four miles from the Chancery, the EAC 
recommended and agreed to immediately increase guard coverage 
from one to two guards.  The augmentation will enhance access 
control of the MSGQ, by allowing one guard to monitor the 
street and approaching pedestrian/vehicle traffic, while the 
other manually operates the pedestrian and/or vehicle gates. 
RSO will coordinate this EAC decision with DS/OPO/FPD.  NOTE: 
Currently, the MSGQ maintains only one 24/7 guard position. 
This guard must single-handedly control access, screen 
visitors and vehicles, and monitor CCTV monitors.  The guard 
is therefore unable to rove, take hygiene breaks, or respond 
to emergencies or other security-related requests for 
assistance without leaving his post.  In addition, the guard 
relies heavily on the Surveillance Detection Unit to respond 
to calls for assistance, as there is no daytime roving 
patrol.  END NOTE. 
 
---------- 
Conclusion 
---------- 
 
5.  (S/NF)  After carefully consideration, and noting no new 
threat reporting specific to Oman, the EAC concluded that 
there has been no substantive change in the local security 
environment, and that the Embassy\'s FPCON and already 
heightened security posture remains appropriate.  The EAC 
remains acutely aware of the need to monitor both the 
regional and local security situation, and is prepared to 
take the necessary countermeasures should changes to either 
occur.  AMB, DCM, RSO, ARSO, RMAS, P/E, PAO, CONS, MGT, MSG, 
DAO, OMC (USDR), and ECA (USCENTAF) participated in the 
meeting.

PRICES, AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
 
1. Summary:  The Omani Internet chat room \"Sablat al-Arab\" -- or 
simply \"Al-Sablah\" -- is the liveliest and most comprehensive 
Arabic-language forum for political and social discourse in the 
country, touching on issues and personalities rarely addressed in 
the conventional media.  While not totally free, nor wholly 
reflective of Omani public opinion, Al-Sablah nevertheless offers 
a worthwhile window into the hot topics and unvarnished views of 
the day.  This edition of Oman Online contains the following 
topics: 
 
 
--- Cheney Stopover In Oman 
--- Visas Post September 11th 
--- Increase in Cooking Gas Prices 
--- Growing Unemployment in Oman 
 
End summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
Cheney Stopover Frustrates Some 
------------------------------- 
 
2. Upon reading a posting of Vice President Cheney\'s presence in 
Oman, one Al-Sablah member reacted angrily stating: \"We do not 
welcome this criminal and liar into our country, why is he here?\" 
Some members speculated on the reason for his landing in Oman and 
stated: \"Perhaps he is coming to clarify the policies of the Bush 
Administration for the GCC countries.\" Other members suggested: 
\"He is traveling as a businessman to check on Halliburton\'s 
contracts in Oman.  That\'s why there was no formal announcement 
of his arrival.\" Some participants were frustrated that they were 
not able to protest the Vice President\'s stopover in Oman, 
saying: \"Usually, when U.S. officials visit European or Western 
countries, people demonstrate against American policies. 
However, these officials come to Oman, entertain themselves, and 
have fun on our beaches without even a word of protest from us! 
We should do more to express our views to these officials in the 
future.\" 
 
---------------------------------- 
Getting A Visa Post September 11th 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. An Al-Sablah member living in a remote region of Oman posed 
the following questions: \"I have a question for everyone who has 
applied for a U.S. student or tourist visa since September 11, 
2001: how long does it take to receive a visa, and how can I be 
sure to get one?\"  Some forum members -- who had never been to 
the United States -- wrote back, \"We heard that things got 
complicated after September 11, and that it can take months to 
obtain a visa.  If you are a student, and you fail to register at 
a U.S. port of entry, you might face deportation and could 
potentially be prohibited from entering the U.S. or ever 
obtaining a visa again.\"  However, many responses portrayed the 
visa process in a positive light.  One recent visa applicant 
noted, \"I got the visa after only two hours in the Embassy, and 
it is valid for five years.  My friend also got a visa, and she 
was able to bring her infant to the interview which made it more 
convenient for her to come to the Embassy.\"  The same writer went 
on to describe the visa process in more detail:  \"There is no 
guaranteed strategy for receiving a visa, because the decision 
depends on the judgment of the interviewing officer, who must 
determine the eligibility of the applicant.\"  Another contributor 
advised, \"Being prepared with all your documents can save you a 
lot of time and frustration when dealing with U.S. airport 
officials.\" 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Cooking Gas Prices And Tempers Are Going Up 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. The increase in the cost of cooking gas in Oman is another hot 
topic in Al-Sablah, with one member asking: \"Who is responsible 
for these price increases. As far as I know, Oman is one of the 
countries that has a gas reserve?\" Other members commented that: 
\"The increase is hurting a lot of people and the regular people 
are the only ones who suffer from these price increases.\" Some 
participants emphatically demanded an explanation by the 
government on this issue, and one Al-Sablah member attempted to 
provide an answer by saying: \"The reason for the increase is that 
the main refinery is undergoing maintenance and has temporarily 
closed down, so the production of gas is taking place in another 
refinery which may be more expensive to operate.\" Other 
frustrated participants rejected this explanation and said: \"This 
is another trick to abuse the citizens and an attempt to take 
more of our money and we won\'t tolerate it.\" Some members even 
went so far as to call for a demonstration in front of the 
Sultan\'s palace and wrote: \"If he knows what is going on, then we 
will urge him to do something about it, and if he does not know 
what is going on, then we will inform him.\" 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Growing Unemployment, Growing Concerns 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. Earlier this year the Diwan announced the creation of 700 new 
government jobs, and a subsequent application and interview 
process. Recently, a local Omani newspaper announced that the 
Diwan was ready to interview the first of three batches of 15,000 
eligible applicants for these positions. This announcement 
sparked a discussion on the unemployment situation in Oman.  One 
Al-Sablah member stated: \"According to some official sources 
there are more than 75,000 jobseekers in Oman, of which only 
45,000 will be interviewed by the Diwan for a meager 700 
positions. This certainly indicates that there is growing 
unemployment in Oman.\" Another member added saying: \"The 
unemployment rate in Oman is steadily growing but instead of 
doing something about it the government only tries to hide it.\" 
Another member concluded saying: \"The Omani Chamber of Commerce 
should take more responsibility for the growing unemployment 
rate, because it has failed to implement a successful economic 
plan in this country.\"

Summary

1. ECA Cultural Envoys Omari Faulkner and Courtland Freeman 
engaged a wide range of Omani basketball players, coaches, and 
students during their highly successful four-day visit to the 
Sultanate.  Welcomed by dignitaries including the newly appointed 
Minister of Sports Affairs, the duo established immediate and 
positive connections with audiences of different ages and 
backgrounds, while garnering extensive and positive press 
coverage, particularly in the Arabic press.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
A Hit Right From The Opening Tip 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. From November 21-25, 2004, recent Georgetown University 
graduates and current ECA Cultural Envoys Omari Faulkner and 
Courtland Freeman conducted a series of basketball clinics and 
workshops for players and coaches during their visit to the 
Sultanate of Oman.  The visit tipped off with a two-day session 
at the Bausher Club, an up-and-coming athletic association in 
Muscat.  During the opening ceremony, which was attended by the 
Minister of Sports Affairs H.E. Ali al-Sunaidi as well as the 
President of the Bausher Club and other dignitaries, the 
Ambassador delivered remarks highlighting the on-court skills and 
off-court academic achievement and service of the Cultural 
Envoys.  After the opening ceremony, Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Freeman 
discussed with coaches and players the advantages and 
disadvantages of certain defensive and offensive set plays.  This 
was followed by a lively Q&A session that focused on identifying 
strategies for developing successful basketball teams.  Later 
that day, the Envoys conducted a basketball clinic for Bausher 
Club players; the clinic, which was scheduled for 90 minutes, 
continued for over three hours because of high demand.  Ten Omani 
girls participated in the basketball drills, an all-too rare 
sight in a country where the sexes are typically separated during 
sporting activities. 
 
----------- 
In The Zone 
----------- 
 
3. The next morning, the Envoys were treated to a tour of the 
Muscat capital region, courtesy of Bausher Club officials.  The 
tour included a visit to Muscat\'s Mutrah souq, the Bait al-Zubair 
Museum, and a windshield tour of the Bausher district.  That 
afternoon, the Envoys again directed a series of drills and 
clinics for young Bausher Club members.  Excitement built 
throughout the day as club players awaited a demonstration game 
at the nearby Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex, requested 
spontaneously by the Minister of Sports Affairs the previous day. 
Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Freeman played for the Bausher Club team 
against the Muscat Stars, a team made up of players from Oman\'s 
national squad.  (The Muscat Stars won 64-59.)  After the 
spirited game, the Bausher Club and the Oman Basketball 
Association presented the Envoys with trophies and traditional 
Omani khanjars (ceremonial daggers). 
 
---------- 
Fast Break 
---------- 
 
4. The program continued with a journey to the city of Al- 
Buraimi, about 350 km. northwest of Muscat on the border with the 
UAE.  The Cultural Envoys visited Al-Buraimi College, the site of 
one of Oman\'s five American Corners, met with the president of 
the college, and toured the facility.  Afterwards the Envoys and 
a busload of Al-Buraimi college students traveled to a nearby 
junior high school where the players held a basketball clinic for 
forty college and junior high students.  An audience of over two 
hundred students observed the clinic.  Although female students 
in this provincial town were reluctant to participate in the 
workshop, they eagerly joined the boys in requesting autographs 
from the Cultural Envoys. 
 
--------------- 
Iraq Bounces In 
--------------- 
 
5. In many ways the most rewarding portion of the Cultural 
Envoys\' trip to Oman was their visit to Al-Buraimi.  The visit 
was a big event for the city, as young people from all over town 
came to the workshop to meet the players.  For many of them this 
was the first time they had met Americans.  During the workshop, 
the PAO was introduced to the dean of Al-Buraimi College and a 
young student, both of whom are Iraqis from Fallujah.  After 
exchanging pleasantries, they said, \"We disagree with what you 
Americans are doing in Fallujah, but we respect you for bringing 
high level U.S. athletes to Al-Buraimi.  Most embassies focus on 
Muscat and ignore other towns.\"  This encounter speaks volumes 
about the effectiveness of the Cultural Envoy program as a tool 
to promote positive public attitudes toward American society and 
values, and to reinforce the Embassy\'s ties with contacts across 
Oman. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Courtland And Omari Assist TAISM 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. The student-athletes rounded out their visit with a program at 
The American International School of Muscat (TAISM), a school 
with 360 students from over 30 different countries.  Mr. Faulkner 
and Mr. Freeman addressed the morning assembly, detailing the 
challenges and rewards of pursuing a balance between academics 
and extracurricular activities.  Next, they visited a 9th-grade 
Health class and discussed issues such as the dangers of drug use 
and the importance of setting goals.  After giving an interview 
to the school newspaper, the two players conducted three separate 
basketball clinics for 4th-graders, 5th-graders, and middle 
school students.  The TAISM students reacted positively to the 
Cultural Envoys, viewing them as role models and asking 
enthusiastically for autographs.  The secondary school principal 
praised the Envoys upon their departure, commenting that the two 
young men \"had a good message\" for TAISM\'s students.  After 
completing their program at TAISM, the players journeyed to the 
PAO\'s residence for lunch with selected journalists and editors 
from Oman\'s press establishment. 
 
-------------------------------- 
A Full-Court Press For The Media 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. Media coverage of the program was extensive and positive, 
particularly in the Arabic-language press.  The November 22 
editions of the Arabic-language dailies \"Al-Shabiba\" (estimated 
circulation 30,000) and \"Al-Watan\" (circulation 40,000) featured 
articles on the opening ceremony at the Bausher Club, complete 
with photographs of the event and of the Cultural Envoys.  The 
English-language newspaper \"Oman Daily Observer\" (circulation 
20,000) carried a similar article.  On November 23, the Envoys 
hit the trifecta by appearing in all three of the Arabic-language 
dailies, including the government-owned \"Oman\" (circulation 
38,000).  Both \"Oman\" and \"Al-Shabiba\" published quarter-page 
stories about the demonstration game at the Sultan Qaboos Sports 
Complex with large color photographs, as did the \"Oman Daily 
Observer.\"  Finally, on November 25, the \"Oman Daily Observer\" 
ran a piece about the Cultural Envoy program, with excerpts from 
interviews with Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Freeman. 
 
------------------- 
A Genuine Slam-Dunk 
------------------- 
 
8. If the pilot program in Oman is any indication, the Cultural 
Envoy project has a bright future indeed.  The level of interest 
shown by Omani youth in the Envoys\' activities, combined with the 
universal expressions of goodwill directed towards these talented 
Americans, bodes well for cultural and sports programming in the 
region.

3. (SBU) The EAC reviewed the updated facts regarding the 
attack in Jeddah (reftel B).  The Committee determined that 
in addition to those measures discussed in reftel A, and to 
counter the threat to a possible \"piggybacked\" intrusion 
through the Embassy\'s main hard-line doors, all section heads 
will brief their staff on the need to ensure that the doors 
close completely behind them as they enter or exit. 
RSO will include this reminder in their new arrival security 
briefing.  RSO also noted that Surveillance Detection assets 
are routinely utilized to observe the public areas of the 
Chancery.

Maintaining Personal Security 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (S/NF) Members of the EAC were reminded to continue 
reinforcing to both their staffs and family members the need 
to maintain a low profile and to remain unpredictable.  RSO 
re-emphasized the importance of immediately reporting 
suspicious activity or security-related incidents, especially 
those involving suspected surveillance, to Post One.  The EAC 
remains acutely aware of the need to monitor both the 
regional and local security environments, and is prepared to 
take the necessary countermeasures should changes to either 
occur.  AMB, DCM, P/E, RSO, ARSO, RMAS, OMC (USDR), DAO, MGT, 
and ECA (USCENTAF) participated in the meeting.

SUBJECT: CHALLENGE FOR NEW JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION: 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) The Ministry of Social Development has approved the 
registration of Oman\'s first journalism association.  Under 
the purview of the Ministry of Information (MOI), the 
association has been received with considerable skepticism by 
journalists.  Its purpose is to strengthen recognition and 
respect of Omani journalists abroad, as well as to provide 
training seminars and advocacy services at home.  The 
association will be formally launched in March by its new 
chairman and close MOI ally, Ali bin Khalfan al-Jabri.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------ 
BIG HELP OR BIG BROTHER? 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U) On November 22, the Ministry of Social Development 
approved the registration application of Oman\'s first 
journalists\' association.  The Omani Journalist Association 
(OJA), which took 2 years to win government approval, is 
currently headed by Ali bin Khalfan al-Jabri, a close friend 
and associate of Information Minister Hamad al-Rashdi.  In a 
meeting on December 6 with PAO and Poloff, al-Jabri said that 
the formation of the OJA is a necessary step to promote the 
professional recognition and integrity of Omani journalists 
abroad, as well as to advocate on behalf of journalists in 
Oman.  To illustrate his point, Al-Jabri said that the 
association had already been contacted about assisting an 
unnamed Omani journalist who was having problems with a local 
paper.  The 12 appointed members of the board of directors 
meet weekly to discuss the OJA\'s course of action now that it 
has been approved.  Issues include where to site its offices, 
establishing sustainable funding and membership, and 
publishing the OJA\'s mission and objectives. 
 
3. (U) Mr. al-Jabri, in conjunction with his Marketing 
Manager Al-Wadhah al-Mawali, said that there has been 
considerable interest in the development of the organization 
and that its activities are being closely watched by 
\"others.\" The association has also received calls from 
journalists, students, and teachers interested in obtaining 
membership.  Al-Jabri said that while the details of 
membership costs and privileges are not yet determined, 
membership will be available to students, professors, and all 
journalists working in Oman.  With the grand launch in March, 
the OJA expects a significant increase from its current 
membership of fifty.  In an effort to grow regionally, 
al-Jabri said that the OJA hopes to work with Egyptian and 
Kuwaiti journalists\' associations as well as reach out to 
membership in larger international journalists\' organizations. 
 
4. (U) In an interview with a UAE newspaper, former IV 
participant and journalist Rafia Salman Al Talei opined that 
the association was \"toothless\" and charged that \"none of the 
so-called NGOs here are working independently and the latest 
association will be another such institution. . . it has 
taken more than three years for the government to accept a 
request to register (it). . . it won\'t be an independent 
body.\" 
 
---------------------------- 
COMMENT:  HORNS OF A DILEMMA 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The OJA faces the unenviable challenge of trying to 
fulfill two widely divergent aspirations.  To the government, 
and under Omani law, the association is supposed to 
facilitate communication between the Information Ministry and 
the journalistic profession (primarily from the former to the 
latter), and be a \"non-governmental\" representative of Oman 
at international fora.  Journalists, however, want an 
association that can win them greater independence.  The 
degree to which the OJA can appease both perspectives will 
likely determine how enduring and meaningful the association 
will be. 
 
6. (SBU) The appointment of al-Jabri, a well-known government 
newscaster and close, personal friend of the Minister of 
Information has gotten OJA off to bad start with journalists. 
 Several sources termed al-Jabri the Minister\'s \"personal 
bidder.\"  Al-Jabri counters these criticisms by reminding 
journalists that a new board of directors will be elected by 
members next year. 
 
7. (SBU) Contributors to Oman\'s Internet message board 
Al-Sabla are also less than inspired by the association\'s 
promises, suggesting instead that the formation of the OJA is 
\"just for show\" as the Omani press attempts to counter recent 
complaints of censorship and journalist bans.  Journalists 
also argue that an association at the beck-and-call of the 
Ministry of Information is simply another mechanism of 
controlling the press, rather than advocating on its behalf.

Forum For The Future 
-------------------- 
 
1. On December 13, the lead editorial in the government-owned 
Arabic daily \"Oman\" was entitled \"Reform from Within.\" 
 
\"The Forum for the Future in Rabat concluded with several 
recommendations for reform in the Arab world.  Most of the 
recommendations fell within the framework of America\'s Greater 
Middle East initiative.  While the majority of Arab participants 
was amenable to the idea of reform and agreed that it is 
essential to their respective countries, there was an even 
greater sentiment expressed that reform initiatives should come 
from within the Arab world and not from outside.  During the 
Forum, Arab countries were asked to review many of their internal 
frameworks, policies, and infrastructures, especially those 
relating to the economy.  Oman participated in the \"Forum for the 
Future\" and at its conclusion Omani representatives expressed a 
desire to continue moving in the direction of development and 
modernization.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Iraq: A Wake Up Call For The Arab World 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. Privately-owned Arabic daily \"Al-Watan\" carried an editorial 
on December 11 entitled \"Poor Iraq\": 
 
\"What is happening in Iraq is disturbing and should serve as a 
lesson to the Arab world.  It seems that all Arab nations are 
targeted for reasons unbeknownst to us.  What we do know is that 
the larger industrial world around us has no mercy or conscience. 
It is not concerned about the effects that its actions have on 
others.  The industrial world only protects its own interests and 
the interests of those closely allied to it. Industrialized 
countries will stop at nothing to remove any perceived obstacle. 
For example, whenever an Arab country tries to flex its muscles 
or appears likely to succeed in something, the industrialized 
countries (led by the United States) immediately deem it a threat 
and try to hold it back.\" 
 
----------------------------- 
The UN: Organizational Reform 
----------------------------- 
 
3. An editorial appeared in the government-owned Arabic daily 
\"Oman\" on December 11 entitled \"Reform of the UN is a Necessity\": 
 
\"If only outside forces call for change in the UN, there will be 
no meaningful reform.  The only way to really reform this body is 
for member states to demand change.  The United Nations lost a 
great deal of credibility when it took a stand against the wars 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, and completely failed to do anything 
substantive to prevent them.  It is essential that the UN, 
starting with the Security Council, undergo reform.  For example, 
UN member countries like Germany, Japan, and Brazil should be 
included in the Security Council to add neutral voices to the 
Council\'s discussion of world issues.  UN agencies need more 
teeth so that they can become proactive and stop being powerless 
do-nothing bureaucracies.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On December 13, at the margins of an Executive Council 
meeting of the Middle East Desalination Research Center 
(MEDREC), an Israeli Foreign Ministry official held a private 
90-minute bilateral with Minister Responsible for Foreign 
Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi.  The discussion reportedly focused 
on Palestine, Syria, and Iran.  While the Israeli and Omani 
viewpoints did not always coincide, the Israelis were greatly 
encouraged by the relaxed and open nature of the 
conversation, and by signs that positive trends toward Middle 
East peace will likely spur continued bilateral contacts with 
Oman.  End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
An Auspicious Opportunity 
------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Visiting NEA/RA Senior Advisor for S&T Charles Lawson, 
attending an Executive Council meeting of the MEDRC, informed 
us of the Israeli delegation\'s readout of the Israelis\' 
December 13 bilateral meeting with Minister Responsible for 
Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi (YBA).  (Note: MEDRC is a 
vestige of the MEPP Track II initiatives coming from the 
peace process prior to the second Intifada. The US, EU, 
Japan, Israel and Arab neighbors belong to it; MEDREC\'s 
headquarters is in Muscat.  End note.) 
 
3. (C) According to a technical water expert on the Israeli 
delegation, Tel Aviv viewed Oman\'s decision to host the MEDRC 
Executive Council as an opportunity for a low-key bilateral 
with MFA Under Secretary Sayyid Badr al-Busaidi, who is 
Oman\'s representative on the Council.  After working to get 
Omani concurrence for the Israeli MFA\'s Deputy DG for Near 
East Affairs Shalom Cohen to join the delegation, the 
Israelis were disappointed to learn that Sayyid Badr would be 
going to Rabat for the Forum for the Future meeting and thus 
not be available.  They were informed, however, that YBA 
himself would meet with Cohen. 
 
---------------------------- 
On Palestine, Syria and Iran 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The Israelis informed Lawson that the lunchtime 
meeting on December 13 actually lasted a full 90 minutes, 
with YBA conducting a relaxed and open conversation.  The two 
sides reportedly agreed on the need to support Abu Mazen, 
with YBA noting that the interim Palestinian leader is due to 
visit Muscat on December 18.  YBA allegedly held open the 
possibility that, should Israel permit the Palestinian 
elections to take place under reasonable conditions, the 
Omanis could perhaps welcome another Israeli MFA visit at the 
DG level in late March. 
 
5. (C) On the subject of Syria, the Israelis claimed that YBA 
was frank in offering his advice, warning Tel Aviv not to 
take seriously any Syrian overtures for negotiations at the 
present time.  YBA was said to have recounted his personal 
experiences with the Syrian President, for whom he initially 
had high hopes but now sees as being essentially tethered to 
the conservative holdovers from his father\'s regime.  YBA 
reportedly also said that Syria may be limited in its ability 
to rein in Hezbollah, fearing the organization has grown too 
strong to control.  The Israelis reportedly disagreed with 
this assessment.  On Iran, YBA\'s main thrust was that Tehran 
was currently focused inward and need not be viewed with 
undue concern, either with respect to nuclear ambitions or 
Hezbollah.  (Note: This characterization of YBA\'s views on 
Iran are not wholly consistent with our experiences with him. 
 End note.)  Again, the Israelis reportedly disagreed on the 
scope of the Iranian threat. 
 
---------------- 
A Positive Start 
---------------- 
 
6. (C) In total, the Israelis gave a positive assessment of 
their longer-than-expected meeting with the Minister.  While 
no specifics were addressed on the issue of reopening the 
Israeli trade mission in Muscat, for instance, the inference 
was that a continuation of working-level contacts is wholly 
possible should recent positive trends prevail.  As further 
evidence, one of the Israeli water experts was invited 
December 14 to meet with scientists at Sultan Qaboos 
University on the possibility of cooperation in the area of 
cloud seeding.  The Israelis proudly noted that the Omani MFA 
put a car and driver at their disposal.  We are likewise 
encouraged that YBA took advantage of this meeting, perhaps 
partially in response to our encouraging Oman to find ways to 
promote Middle East peace in light of recent changes in the 
Palestinian leadership.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU)  Journalist Mohammed al-Harthi (protect) and writer 
Abdullah al-Riyami (protect) have been barred from publishing 
in all media and press in Oman for having criticized the pace 
of democratic reform in the country.  The ban includes the 
withdrawal of al-Harthi\'s weekly column \"Platforms\" from the 
Arabic daily \"Oman.\"  The government\'s action is receiving 
attention in the Arabic and international media and has been 
a topic of considerable discussion in the Omani Internet 
chatroom Al-Sablah.  The public\'s ire is focused on the 
Ministry of Information (MOI), sparking calls for more 
freedom of the press in Oman.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
DISCUSSION ON DEMOCRATIC REFORM LEADS TO CENSORSHIP 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (SBU)  Abdullah al-Riyami and fellow writer Mohammed 
al-Harthi were both banned from Omani media and press after 
appearing via teleconference on a program aired last July on 
Iran\'s Arabic language satellite channel Al-Alam.  The 
program, Under the Ashes, was on the subject of democratic 
reform and political participation in Oman.  The two writers 
expressed their doubts about the Omani government\'s 
willingness to begin genuine democratic reform, noting that 
elections to the 83-member Majlis al-Shura (Consultative 
Council) are \"a mere superficial exercise\" to improve the 
government\'s image abroad.  Furthermore, they attributed the 
downward trend in voter turnout for the 2000 and 2003 
elections to the people\'s rejection of a parliament that they 
claim has no influence on government. 
 
3. (SBU)  In apparent reaction to their comments on Al-Alam 
and other public criticisms of the government, the MOI issued 
verbal instructions to all editors of press and media, 
forbidding interviews or publication of the two writers. 
(Note:  Mohammed Abdul Khaled (protect), a journalist with 
the privately owned Arabic daily \"Al-Watan,\" confirmed that 
he received a circular from the MOI informing him of the ban. 
 End note.)  Al-Harthi\'s weekly column \"Platforms\" was 
abruptly removed from the government-owned Arabic daily 
\"Oman\".  Al-Riyami, already blacklisted from publication in 
the Sultanate for the past 10 years, became marginalized even 
further as the new ban prohibits reporters from interviewing 
him or covering any events in which he participates.  Both 
writers told Poloff that journalists, producers, and editors 
confirmed the ban, and Al-Harthi recounted that the day after 
his appearance on Al-Alam, his editor told him to \"take a 
break\" instead of submitting his latest article.  When 
pressed further, the editor confirmed that he had been given 
instructions not to publish al-Harthi\'s work. 
 
--------------------------------- 
BAN DRAWS INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (U)  The two writers have garnered both local and 
international support.  Fellow journalists in opposition to 
the ban withdrew their submissions to the \"Oman\" weekly 
supplement for three weeks, forcing a suspension of its 
publication.  Kuwait\'s daily \"Al-Taleea\" has published 
articles rebuking the Ministry\'s action.  In addition, the 
France-based Reporters Without Borders and Canada-based 
Committee to Protect Journalists have also taken on the 
cause, sending letters to the Embassy of Oman in Washington, 
D.C. and publishing letters of protest on the Internet.  Both 
organizations have urged Oman to allow the national media the 
freedom to interview the two writers to prove that political 
modernization is under way in Oman.  Contributors to the 
Internet chatroom Al-Sablah, in the past often quite critical 
of Mohammed al-Harthi\'s views, have rallied in support of the 
writers and referred to the Ministry of Information as the 
\"Ministry of Hiding.\" 
 
------------------------ 
THE LIMITS OF EXPRESSION 
------------------------ 
 
6. (U)  The discussion in Al-Sablah has once again brought to 
the forefront the issue of freedom of expression, with 
journalists questioning to what degree it exists in Oman. 
Articles 29 and 31 of the Basic Statute (Oman\'s de facto 
constitution) guarantee freedom of the press and expression, 
but \"within the limits of the law.\"  Prohibition against 
\"anything leading to discord, harming state security, or 
abusing human dignity\" are vague and vulnerable to subjective 
enforcement.  Fellow journalists and contributors to 
Al-Sablah commented that al-Harthi did not exceed the law by 
saying anything negative about the government, but instead 
offered a frank discussion of the law.  In addition to 
assessing the legalities of al-Harthi\'s comments, 
contributors to Al-Sablah complain of excessive praising of 
the ministries and the absence of critical analysis in the 
newspapers. 
 
7. (SBU)  Controls on free speech extend to alleged 
harassment and imprisonment of journalists.  Al-Harthi and 
al-Riyami told Poloff of several cases of writers who have 
been subjected to arrest and interrogation after posting 
critical comments on Al-Sablah.  Al-Harthi also recounted the 
story of Yahyai Salem al-Mantheri, a colleague who had been 
brought in for questioning by the police after complaints by 
some people that characters in a fictional story by the 
writer appeared eerily close to their lives.  There have been 
unsubstantiated stories of journalists arrested without due 
process, including the case of a Sudanese writer for the 
local Arabic daily \"Al-Watan\" who, after writing something 
critical of Oman, was subsequently expelled from the country. 
 Al-Harthi discussed this subject in his appearance on 
Al-Alam, saying that the Oman press law, little changed since 
1984, \"gives the Ministry of Information the power to try and 
jail journalists without having to explain itself to anyone.\" 
 
--------------------------- 
ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE HISTORY 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU)  Al-Harthi, winner of the UK-based Ibn Batuta Award 
for Excellence in Media last year, asserts that the MOI has 
operated as a security apparatus since the intellectual 
movements leading up to the Dhofar Rebellion in the early 
1970\'s.  Al-Harthi and al-Riyami point to bans, harassment of 
journalists, virtual lack of libraries and limited access to 
history as the MOI\'s tools to suppress intellectuals who 
challenge the lack of freedom in Oman.  According to 
al-Harthy, one prominent example is Musalem bin Nafl 
al-Katheri, a Dhofar revolutionist turned government 
supporter.  Al-Katheri recently completed his memoirs 
discussing the Dhofar Rebellion and his subsequent work in 
the government.  In what al-Riyami says is an attempt to hide 
history, al-Katheri\'s book, \"The Bleeding Wound,\" was banned 
by the government.  Before banning the book however, the 
government approached al-Katheri to purchase all rights to 
it.  When al-Katheri declined, he was invited to his 
relative\'s house in Muscat where Internal Security was 
waiting for him.  He was again offered an opportunity to sell 
his rights to the government and again refused.  Al-Katheri 
was then brought in to see the head of the Royal Omani Police 
where the Inspector General and two judges were waiting. 
According to al-Riyami, al-Katheri had no lawyer present and 
was summarily sentenced to three years in jail.  Shortly 
after sentencing, al-Katheri suffered a serious heart attack 
and, after spending time in the hospital, had his sentenced 
commuted.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (SBU)  The ban on the two writers apparently has been 
publicized abroad by fellow journalist/activist Mohammed 
al-Yahyai.  Currently a journalist with Al-Hurra in the 
United States, al-Yahyai is himself reportedly banned from 
work in Oman and is actively campaigning for freedom of press 
in the Gulf region.  Several sources told Poloff that they 
believe the MOI\'s ban has backfired, and they expect some 
revisions in the press law might be enacted in order to take 
the issue out of the spotlight.  Both banned writers feel 
this incident may ultimately have a positive impact in Oman, 
pointing to evidence that the government is taking discreet 
steps toward loosening controls.  For the past year, \"Nizwa\" 
magazine was required to be submitted to the Information 
Ministry for censorship prior to publication.  Just recently, 
the MOI released the magazine from this requirement and it 
has since gone back to self-censorship.  In another case of 
apparent MOI easing, a professor at Sultan Qaboos University 
(SQU) was barred from publishing a translation of \"Memories 
of Zanzibar.\"  The book has now been ordered for publication 
by the MOI.

REF: Muscat 1703 and previous 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  This is an action message.  Please see paragraph 8 for 
action requested. 
 
2. In view of the success and popularity of Oman\'s five 
existing American Corners, Embassy Muscat requests funding 
for two additional ones.  Suitable locations have already 
been identified: the Muscat Higher College of Technology, a 
leading vocational training institute; and Sultan Qaboos 
University, the nation\'s flagship educational institution. 
The Higher College of Technology is our priority location 
for a new Corner because of its focus on non-elite students 
from lower socio-economic backgrounds.  Post\'s previous 
Corners cost USD $54,000.  However, we anticipate that the 
cost of each of the proposed Corners will be approximately 
USD $33,000 because computers, furniture and other start-up 
items are already in place at both locations.  End summary. 
 
----------------- 
Solid Foundations 
----------------- 
 
3. During 2004, Embassy Muscat opened five American Corners 
in the Sultanate of Oman, including the first Corner in NEA. 
The Corners are invaluable as accessible sources of accurate 
information about the U.S., and as platforms for innovative 
public diplomacy programming. Each Corner contains roughly 
1,000 books, five Internet-accessible PCs, videocassettes, 
DVDs, CD-ROMS, a multimedia component system, and digital 
videoconferencing equipment.  The enthusiasm with which 
Omanis have received the Corners indicates a bright future 
for this program in a critical part of the Arab world. 
 
-------------------- 
A History Of Success 
-------------------- 
 
4. Although American Corners have only been in existence in 
Oman for a short time, the Embassy has produced successful 
programs at each of the five locations.  For example, the 
Modern College of Business and Science\'s American Corner was 
the venue for lectures by an Embassy Science Fellow on 
environmental issues, a DVC by the noted Native American 
storyteller Gayle Ross to celebrate the opening of the 
National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, and 
the highly successful NEA-funded American Corners Directors 
Workshop.  The Salalah American Corner, located in a private 
English-language training institute, hosted a two-day 
Internet workshop for English teachers.  The Corner in the 
northern border town of Al-Buraimi was one of the 
programming venues for the ECA Cultural Envoys Omari 
Faulkner and Courtland Freeman in November.  All of the 
Corners held viewings of documentary films and discussions 
on the U.S. Presidential elections. 
 
---------------------------------- 
More Events Just Around The Corner 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. The Embassy plans numerous additional programs at the 
Corners in the coming months.  Specifically, visiting 
American Fulbrighters will conduct presentations on \"Islam 
in America\" and \"American Values.\"  The Embassy\'s English 
Language Fellow will offer workshops to Omani educators on 
such topics as \"English For Specific Purposes\" and \"Language 
Assessment.\"  Both the Regional English Language Officer 
(RELO) and Regional Information Resources Officer (RIRO) 
will conduct presentations and workshops at several Corners 
in FY05, with topics ranging from \"Internet Search 
Techniques\" to \"Teaching Techniques to Enhance Reading 
Comprehension.\"  In addition, the Embassy\'s Educational 
Advisor will visit each Corner regularly to engage in 
outreach and recruitment activities.  The Embassy also plans 
to program a variety of speakers at the Corners, including a 
Black History Month speaker for February 2005. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
You Can\'t Have Too Much Of A Good Thing 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. The dean of Muscat\'s Higher College of Technology, a 
vocational college enrolling over 3,000 lower income male 
and female students, recently expressed to the Ambassador 
and PAO his keen interest in strengthening the college\'s 
ties with the United States, improving the English language 
skills of students, and broadening the students\' 
understanding of the U.S.  A potential avenue for achieving 
these aims is to install an American Corner in the 
multimedia resource center of the college.  If funded, this 
American Corner, our first in a technical college, would 
increase the Embassy\'s access to non-elite Omanis, a target 
audience for us since the September 11 attacks.  Another 
proposed site for an American Corner is Oman\'s most 
prestigious educational institution, Sultan Qaboos 
University (SQU).  SQU has informed the Embassy of its 
willingness to host a Corner.  The university attracts 
Oman\'s best students [enrollment approximately 12,000] and 
offers degrees in a wide range of disciplines. 
 
--------------- 
Funding Corners 
--------------- 
 
7. The addition of two American Corners would substantially 
contribute to the Embassy\'s MPP goal of favorably 
influencing Omani public opinion about the U.S. and 
broadening understanding of American society and values, 
while simultaneously bolstering our cultural and academic 
outreach efforts.  Each of Muscat\'s five existing American 
Corners cost approximately USD $54,000, and were funded by 
the Office of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and 
Public Affairs (R).  The budget for each proposed Corner 
would be substantially less because computers, furniture and 
other start-up items are already in place at both locations. 
Our estimated start-up cost for the proposed Higher College 
of Technology and Sultan Qaboos University American Corners 
is $33,000 each.  The budget breaks down in this way: 
 
- $14,000 for collection of book titles 
- $11,000 for DVC equipment 
- $3,000 for DVD and videocassette collection 
- $2,000 for multimedia component system 
- $2,000 for CD-ROM collection 
- $1,000 for miscellaneous expenses 
 
Total:  $33,0000 
 
8.  Action requested:  The Embassy requests that \"R\" and NEA 
fund both proposed Corners at the indicated levels. Our top 
priority is the Higher College because of its heavy use and 
focus on non-elite students.

SUBJECT: OMAN ONLINE: MINISTRY OF INFORMATION, PRISONS, AND 
WOMENS MAGAZINES 
 
1. Summary:  The Omani Internet chat room \"Sablat al-Arab\" -- or 
simply \"Al-Sablah\" -- is the liveliest and most comprehensive 
Arabic-language forum for political and social discourse in the 
country, touching on issues and personalities rarely addressed in 
the conventional media.  While not totally free, nor wholly 
reflective of Omani public opinion, Al-Sablah nevertheless offers 
a worthwhile window into the hot topics and unvarnished views of 
the day.  This edition of Oman Online contains the following 
topics: 
 
 
--- The Ministry of Information and the Omani media 
--- Human Rights Violations in Omani Prisons 
--- Censorship and Omani Women\'s Magazines 
 
End summary. 
 
------------------------ 
The Ministry Of Darkness 
------------------------ 
 
2. Al-Sablah members are discussing the Ministry of Information\'s 
decision to ban some Omani journalists and how the decision is 
impacting the Omani media environment.  Some members argued, \"The 
ministry of information should be called the ministry of darkness 
for the injustices it perpetrates against Omani journalists.  The 
most frightening thing is that each year the ministry seems more 
determined to deny us the right to a free press.\"  Another member 
asked, \"What gives the ministry of information the right to rule 
over us and to control everything we see and hear.\" Several 
participants offered examples of incidents that they believe 
demonstrate the harmful effect that the ministry has on press 
freedoms.  One stated, \"The ministry is behind the decision to 
pull television shows.  It regularly has television presenters 
fired because their guest express opinions that are not favored 
by the government.  Another participant wrote, \"There was a 
famous TV talk show hosts who discussed social issues and 
explored people\'s opinions about them.  His show was taken off 
the air until he `improved\' its content.\" The discussion 
concluded with the same participant adding, \"The ministry ordered 
the show\'s announcer banned for good when he returned for from a 
`hiatus\' and did a program on poverty in Oman.\" 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Human Rights Violations In Omani Prisons 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. One Al-Sablah member began a discussion on the violation of 
human rights in Omani prisons stating, \"There are major 
violations of human rights in Oman\'s prison\'s.  I have heard of 
numerous cases of police officers torturing innocent people into 
confessing to crimes that they did not commit.  Another member 
asked, \"Do international organizations check or monitor the 
situation in Omani prisons?\"  One member share a personal 
experience, \"When I went to visit someone, thank God it was an 
official visit, I saw a long line of women, children, and old 
people waiting outside on one of the hottest days of the year 
just to enter the visitor\'s line with no guarantee that they 
would see their loved ones.\"  Another member stated, \"Omani 
prisons are so bad that they cannot even meet the most basic 
human rights criteria like the right to see an attorney or the 
right to have access to family members.  If our prisons cannot 
even satisfy these requirements, we should not be surprised that 
other more egregious violations occur.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Do Omani Women\'s Magazines Escape Censorship? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. Al-Sablah also discussed whether women\'s magazines are 
subjected to censorship.  One member states, \"It appears women\'s 
magazines enjoy a free to provide their readers quality 
information on any aspect of Omani life, but other publications 
are denied this freedom.\"  One participant responded, \"Omani 
women\'s magazines may seem to have more freedom but if you 
compare them with other international or regional magazines you 
can see the difference.\"  Another member stated, \"One of the most 
widely read women\'s magazine in Oman has a foreign board of 
directors, foreign editors, and a foreign marketing staff.  This, 
which may explain its willingness to explore substantive issues.\" 
Several members speculated on the effect that censorship has in 
determining the quality of a magazine stating, \"It seems women\'s 
magazines are successful because they largely manage to avoid the 
heavy hand of censorship.\"  Other participants responded by 
stating, \"Perhaps the censors are less stringent on women\'s 
magazines because they lack understanding of the real issues 
effecting Omani women\'s lives and are therefore less apt to 
censor articles and information published in Omani women\'s 
magazines.\"

SUBJECT: A WARNING FROM MOM 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Richard L. Baltimore III. 
Reason: 1.4 (b). 
 
1. (U) On December 14, Oman\'s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) 
published an announcement warning citizens about employment 
in Iraq.  The informal translation of the announcement is as 
follows (begin text): 
 
The Ministry of Manpower has noticed the increase in 
employment offers in the brotherly Republic of Iraq through 
published advertisements in the press and employment offices. 
 In view of the current security situation witnessed in the 
Iraqi scene, the Ministry of Manpower calls upon Omani 
citizens not to be carried away by such monetary temptations 
offered to them in return for enrollment for employment in 
Iraq, in avoidance of the threats they might face until 
security and stability prevail over brotherly Iraq, God 
willing.  (End text.) 
 
2. (U) On December 15, coincidentally, Omani headlines were 
devoted to the results of the previous day\'s Cabinet meeting, 
chaired by Sultan Qaboos.  The Sultan was reported as having 
expressed hope in the meeting that \"the efforts of the 
interim Iraqi government and other parties concerned would 
succeed in achieving stability for the brotherly Iraqi 
people.\" 
 
3. (C) Iraqi Ambassador-designate Abdul Rasul al-Wash told 
Pol/E Chief December 15 that he was somewhat disappointed 
with the Manpower Ministry\'s warning, but found the 
sentiments entirely understandable given the prevailing 
security situation in his country.  He pointed out, after 
all, that the State Department similarly warns U.S. citizens 
from traveling to Iraq.  Al-Wash confirmed that the Omani 
government did not consult with him before issuing the 
warning, but observed that he had not yet formally presented 
his credentials.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Visiting NEA DAS Dibble reviewed themes in the 
Secretary\'s oral message with Omani Foreign Minister Bin 
 
SIPDIS 
Alawi.  Concerning Iran\'s behavior, the Minister recommended 
finding ways to address Tehran\'s security concerns and 
feelings of isolation as an effective means of reducing its 
possible nuclear ambitions.  Encouraging Iranian WTO 
accession could also produce reform momentum.  Bin Alawi 
reiterated Oman\'s full support for Iraq and readiness to 
receive any visiting officials, but he gave no firm 
indication of when its reconstruction pledge might be 
fulfilled.  The Minister hailed BMENA as contributing to 
regional reform despite some lingering differences among the 
various states.  He underscored Oman\'s desire for a Free 
Trade Agreement as an essential ingredient in expanding the 
Sultanate\'s economy.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On December 12, visiting NEA DAS Philo Dibble, 
accompanied by the Ambassador and Pol/E Chief (notetaker), 
reviewed the substance of ref A oral message from the 
Secretary with Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf 
 
SIPDIS 
bin Alawi (YBA).  Discussion of Oman\'s support for the 
Palestinian Authority and Middle East peace was reported in 
ref C. 
 
---- 
Iran 
---- 
 
3. (C) DAS Dibble reviewed U.S. policy views and concerns 
about Iran.  Echoing his December 5 remarks to DNSA Hadley in 
Manama (ref B), YBA observed that it was difficult to talk to 
Iran about its nuclear ambitions because Tehran flatly 
refuses to acknowledge any.  But he feels the political and 
military pressures on Iran, particularly as it is now 
virtually surrounded by U.S. forces and abuts nuclear-armed 
Pakistan, drives its desire for due respect from the 
international community.  Noting that Iran\'s nuclear power 
industry traces its roots to the Shah\'s regime, the Minister 
argued that Tehran\'s isolation forces it to resort to dealing 
with nations like Russia and North Korea.  Easing the 
international pressure and finding a way to reassure Tehran 
of its security, he believes, would reduce any incentive 
Tehran might have to pursue nuclear weapons. 
 
4. (C) The Minister believes the USG needs to make a choice 
on the end-game for Iran and how to bring it about. 
Washington can rely on either pressure or \"process.\"  Given 
recent and ongoing conflicts in the region, YBA was adamant 
in saying further military strife is not welcome.  The only 
real choice therefore is resorting to process, i.e. the 
peaceful transformation of Iran\'s government.  With 65 
percent of Iran\'s population comprised of young people hungry 
for change, promoting Iran\'s accession to WTO could be just 
the device to harness their support and undermine the 
foundations of the conservative ruling class.  Such an 
indirect tactic is particularly apt given the certainty of a 
political conservative winning the presidential election in 
2005. 
 
---- 
Iraq 
---- 
 
5. (C) YBA reiterated Oman\'s policy of giving Iraq \"all 
possible support,\" saying that he stands ready to receive any 
visiting Iraqi officials, be it FM Zebari, President Yawwar, 
or others.  On the question of disbursing Oman\'s USD 5 
million pledge to Iraq\'s reconstruction, Bin Alawi excused 
Muscat\'s inaction thus far by complaining that it receives 
numerous ad hoc requests from various Iraqi ministers.  Oman 
wants to keep any contributions \"above board,\" and seeks 
reassurance that any donation will be properly coordinated. 
 
6. (C) DAS Dibble underscored the USG\'s concern over 
Al-Jazeera\'s out-moded and unhelpful coverage of the conflict 
in Iraq.  YBA expressed confidence that the problem will be 
settled as Iraq becomes increasingly stable.  He agreed that 
Al-Jazeera has \"crossed red lines\" in its reporting, and that 
the phenomenon has spread to numerous other satellite 
channels.  He cautioned the U.S. to be tactful in how it 
addresses its concerns to Qatar, which he believes will be 
willing to engage in discussion but will not respond 
productively to outright accusations.  Should talks fail to 
resolve the matter, YBA conspiratorially suggested using 
technical means to interfere with Al-Jazeera\'s satellite 
links. 
----------------------------- 
Political and Economic Reform 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Reiterating his preference for the word 
\"modernization\" over \"reform,\" the Minister hailed the BMENA 
initiative as worthy progress, despite some differences of 
view within the region.  Even within the GCC, he noted, there 
is a considerable divergence in states\' willingness to 
embrace change.  The USG\'s commitment not to impose reform 
from abroad has not sunk in with everyone, but YBA was 
optimistic that the ultimate goals were widely shared despite 
differences in pace. 
 
8. (C) On linking reform to Middle East peace, YBA shrewdly 
noted that the Arab \"man in the street\" is far more concerned 
with local bread and butter issues than Palestine, but that 
the political elites will resort to linkage because, unlike 
the choice to pursue real change, they cannot be held 
accountable for what happens in the peace negotiations.  The 
governments choosing that crass ploy made themselves clear in 
Rabat.  YBA opined that Saudi FM Saud al-Faisal does not 
personally believe in the statements he was forced to deliver 
in Rabat, but that his speech was reflective of the fact that 
Saudi society perhaps is still not yet ready to undertake the 
needed reforms. 
 
9. (C) As for the Forum for the Future, YBA thought the first 
meeting in New York made it obvious that the business 
community had clear notions for a course of action, but that 
the civil society groups were far more vague.  He feels that 
addressing political issues will nevertheless make it easier 
to progress in the other areas.  Looking at Oman, the 
Minister said the country is open and has accorded women full 
rights.  The economy needs considerably more development, 
however, particularly in order to create more jobs for both 
sexes.  Oman\'s enthusiasm for Free Trade Agreement 
negotiations with the U.S. is driven by that need to develop 
further the macro-economy.  YBA was adamant that Saudi 
opposition to the Bahrain-U.S. FTA would not dissuade any of 
the five other GCC members from going forward with the 
accords on a bilateral basis.

1. (C) Summary: Omani Minister of Commerce and Industry 
Maqbool bin Ali bin Sultan reassured visiting NEA DAS Philo 
Dibble that Oman remains firmly committed to signing a 
bilateral FTA with the U.S.  Bluster from the Saudis 
notwithstanding, Maqbool reiterated that the Omani cabinet 
has already approved the decision to move forward with an FTA 
along the lines of the U.S.-Bahrain agreement.  While 
backdoor negotiations between the Bahrainis and Saudis 
concerning alleged incompatibility between bilateral trade 
pacts and the GCC charter have failed to yield a definitive 
resolution, Maqbool is confident that Sultan Qaboos will 
maintain his unwavering support for a bilateral agreement 
during the upcoming GCC Summit in Bahrain December 20-21. 
DAS Dibble emphasized USG support for GCC integration and 
pledged that we would be willing to work with Oman and other 
nations to address Customs Union and other concerns during 
the negotiations.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Getting Down to Business 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) On December 12, during a half-hour morning meeting 
with visiting NEA DAS Philo Dibble and the Ambassador, Omani 
Minister of Commerce and Industry Maqbool bin Ali bin Sultan 
pointedly and repeatedly emphasized Oman\'s desire to move 
forward on a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with the 
United States.  DAS Dibble stressed the USG belief that 
regional integration would be strengthened through the FTA 
process, and that the U.S. is willing to work with the GCC on 
addressing its concerns that bilateral FTAs would undermine 
the GCC Customs Union. 
 
--------------------------- 
All Fingers Point to Riyadh 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Maqbool asserted that the Saudis were caught off guard 
by the speed with which the U.S. concluded its FTA with 
Bahrain.  In his view, Riyadh believed that it could achieve 
WTO accession prior to any deal being struck between 
Washington and Manama.  When the Bahrain discussions ended in 
four months and Oman and the UAE were recently announced as 
upcoming FTA partners, the Saudis felt their only option was 
to make a public statement cajoling the other GCC states into 
honoring the GCC Charter and renouncing bilateral agreements. 
 (Note: As an aside, Maqbool stated that Saudi Arabia will 
encounter many bumps along the path to WTO accession, 
particularly with the EU over its gas sector (NFI).) 
 
4. (C) In spite of such bluster, Maqbool said that Sultan 
Qaboos and the Omani Cabinet of Ministers agree with the U.S. 
position that Oman should negotiate a bilateral FTA.  He also 
indicated that progress was being made behind the scenes in 
the GCC on the issue of FTAs, and that Oman has made its 
position very clear to the other members.  Maqbool predicts 
that the December 20-21 GCC Summit in Bahrain will yield an 
accord on moving forward with bilateral agreements, 
especially in light of Bahrain already having signed its FTA. 
 In the end, the Saudis\' biggest concern is the integrity of 
the GCC Customs Union and its industrial protection policies. 
 Maqbool suggested that a public statement of support for the 
GCC from the USG would be extremely helpful in resolving the 
current impasse.  DAS Dibble noted this request and reassured 
the Omani minister that the USG\'s intent is not to undercut 
the GCC in any way. 
 
-------------------------- 
Taking the Necessary Steps 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Maqbool stressed the need to conclude FTA negotiations 
by July, and mentioned that the Omani government is taking 
numerous steps to prepare for this aggressive timetable. 
Economic expert Dr. Said al-Riyami will be posted to the 
Omani Embassy in Washington, the Ministry expects to hire 
other consultants and/or legal advisors to assist in the 
negotiations and implementation of an FTA, and the Minister 
acknowledged the need to cultivate contacts on Capitol Hill. 
DAS Dibble noted that lawyers helped greatly in the Bahrain 
negotiations.  In comparison with the relatively 
straightforward ratification system in Oman, Maqbool 
expressed a newfound appreciation for the complexity of 
getting FTA ratification in the U.S.  Nevertheless, he 
insisted that an FTA is still Oman\'s primary goal: \"I\'m sure 
it\'s worth it; we\'re committed and we\'re moving forward. 
We\'ll get it done.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Maqbool demonstrated a keen grasp of the intricacies 
and accelerated timetable necessary to achieve an FTA, and 
his Ministry has been reacting noticeably more quickly in 
their interactions with the Embassy.  While he was reluctant 
to completely dismiss Saudi recalcitrance on the bilateral 
FTA dilemma within the GCC, Maqbool appeared confident that 
the Saudis would have no choice in the end but to accept the 
reality that the U.S. is moving forward with willing partners 
in the region.

1. Oman is not a regional or offshore financial center and 
does not have a significant money laundering problem. Its 
small banking sector is supervised by the Central Bank of 
Oman (CBO), which has the authority to suspend or reorganize 
a bank\'s operations. In 2004, Oman had a total of 17 banks 
with 353 branches.  The banking system consisted of five 
local commercial banks with 304 Omani and 11 foreign 
branches, three local specialized banks with 26 local 
branches, and nine foreign incorporated banks with 23 
branches in the country. Smuggling trade goods across Oman\'s 
long borders and coastline is becoming an increasing concern. 
Oman may also be vulnerable to instances of trade-based money 
laundering and customs fraud as well as unregulated lending 
schemes that fall outside government purview. 
 
--------------------------- 
Legislation and Enforcement 
--------------------------- 
 
2. In March 2002, Royal Decree No. 34/2002 was issued 
promulgating \"The Law of Money Laundering.\" This new law 
strengthened the existing money laundering regulations by 
detailing bank responsibilities, widening the definition of 
money laundering to include funds obtained through any 
criminal means, and providing for the seizure of assets and 
other penalties. The new law applies to other types of 
non-bank financial institutions as well.  In a 2003 report, 
Omani officials stated that \"the legal freezing measures 
designated by the Money-Laundering Act are applied to both 
residents and non-residents holding funds, financial assets, 
or other economic resources in the Sultanate of Oman if they 
are linked to terrorist-related activities.\"  In addition to 
an interagency committee for Anti-Money Laundering, the 
Sultanate has established a senior-level National Committee 
for Combating Terrorist Finance. 
 
3. Royal Decree 72/2004 of July 7, 2004 promulgated the 
implementing regulations for the Law of Money Laundering (ref 
B). These regulations include, inter alia, the following 
provisions: 
 
-- a requirement that financial institutions \"take steps to 
obtain information on customers who open accounts in an 
indirect way\" and \"keep electronic data on e-transactions.\" 
-- guidelines in the area of profiling, requiring 
institutions to \"check and double-check\" certain classes of 
transactions (e.g., \"customers getting loans from foreign 
institutions\" and the \"keeping of accounts that do not match 
the business nature.\" 
-- requirements for government authorities to investigate all 
\"suspicious dealings\" using internal and external reporting 
mechanisms. 
-- authorization for the attorney general to freeze disputed 
assets upon the request of investigators. 
-- protection of \"secret\" information. 
-- an extensive training program, with introductory courses 
supplemented by instruction in international best practices 
and effective investigation techniques. 
-- definition of the organizational structure of the National 
Committee for Combating Money Laundering. 
-- cooperation with international organizations and 
information exchange with other countries, including 
collaboration on extradition issues. 
 
4. The Royal Oman Police (ROP), in coordination with the CBO, 
is responsible for investigating money laundering activities. 
Banks are required to know their customers and report all 
suspicious transactions.  Compliance personnel are now 
present in all banks. Oman established a Financial 
Intelligence Unit (FIU) in 2002 to review suspicious 
transactions and help coordinate resulting investigations. 
As of the end of 2004, there had been no arrests under the 
new law.  No formal mechanism exists for information sharing 
among the GCC Central Banks or FIUs, although a banking 
supervision committee within the GCC does issue broad 
guidelines for financial institution oversight. 
 
------------------------ 
Charitable Organizations 
------------------------ 
 
5. Oman regulates charitable organizations under the 
Non-Governmental Organizations Act promulgated 
pursuant to Royal Decree 14/2000.  Under this act, the 
Minister of Social Development is responsible for approving 
and monitoring all charitable contributions and fundraising 
activities.  There is a government-registered charity (the 
Oman Charitable Organization, or OCO), and all citizens and 
entities are encouraged to use this official channel for 
donations.  The Ministry of Social Development recently 
registered a charity fund run by a prominent local 
businessman. 
 
6. At various times, charitable donations have been collected 
through individual accounts in local banks and sent abroad by 
individuals to support the Palestinian Intifada and for the 
building of schools or mosques in Africa and South Asia.  The 
local Shia minority is believed to transfer money to support 
their religious imams, mainly in Iraq and Iran.  Apart from 
monthly remittances by expatriate laborers, local Indian 
businessmen have also been reported to channel funds in 
support of Hindu religious groups.  In all of these cases, 
the CBO possesses the authority and ability to check on these 
accounts as all banks and moneychangers have the obligation 
to report on transactions as noted above. 
 
-------------------------- 
Informal Lending Societies 
-------------------------- 
 
7. Informal lending societies reportedly have emerged in 
recent years as a popular alternative to formal banking in 
Oman.  These societies provide interest free loans as a means 
for young Omanis to purchase homes and cars or service bank 
debts.  The societies became the target of three separate 
warnings from the Ministry of Social Development calling on 
Omanis to avoid these unregulated and unregistered financial 
entities. Nevertheless, many Omanis flocked to these 
societies in solidarity with members of their tribes and in 
protest against double-digit interest rates being charged by 
commercial banks.  Later, as membership numbered in the 
thousands, serious problems emerged as several founding 
members absconded with funds from their societies. 
Suspicious members withdrew from the schemes, causing the 
collapse of many societies. 
 
8. Reports of excess liquidity in the Omani financial system 
and the demonstrated popularity of informal societies lend 
credence to the view that hundreds of thousands if not 
millions of dollars are circulating outside the formal 
financial system and its strict regulations, auditing 
requirements, and accountability to the CBO.  In addition, 
some informal societies reportedly are run by Islamic groups, 
ostensibly with ties to the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious 
Affairs, who make trips to various destinations abroad. 
Transactions in these societies are made in cash, and the 
societies are not registered with any government agency or 
institution.  While such practices constitute only a fraction 
of overall financial transactions in Oman, they merit greater 
scrutiny on the part of ROP and CBO authorities. 
 
--------------------- 
International Accords 
--------------------- 
 
9. Oman is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and is a 
member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which itself is 
a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Oman 
supported the creation of a regional FATF-style body in 
Bahrain, and sent top government officials to the MENA FATF 
inauguration in November 2004. Although not yet a party to 
the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism, Omani officials insist that Oman will 
soon accede (ref C). 
 
10. Oman has responded to terrorist asset freeze lists from 
the UN 1267 Committee by distributing the lists to all banks 
and other financial institutions in the country for checking 
against their accounts. Thus far, the Government has reported 
negative results. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. Overall, Oman maintains a strong and effective regulatory 
regime with respect to its formal financial institutions. 
Oman should continue to implement its anti-money laundering 
program, specifically dedicating adequate resources to its 
FIU and training criminal investigators to initiate money 
laundering investigations from the field. Oman also should 
become more aware of the dangers of alternative remittance 
systems and unregulated lending societies to launder money 
and sidestep formal government oversight of financial 
transactions.  Applying the careful lessons learned in its 
tight regulation of the formal sector, Oman must now 
recognize that informal money transfer and cash-based lending 
societies represent vulnerabilities that must be addressed.

Security Environment 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  On December 15, the Ambassador chaired a meeting 
of the core Emergency Action Committee (\"EAC\") to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture prior to the local weekend.  The 
meeting opened with a discussion of the local security 
situation, which the EAC continued to characterize as stable. 
 Likewise, the EAC noted no new threat reporting specific to 
Oman, and concurred that there have been no substantive 
changes in previously reported assessments of the security 
and threat environments.  Members of the EAC cited no 
security incidents among their staffs or family members. 
 
-------------- 
Holiday Events 
-------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  The EAC also discussed numerous private and 
official events scheduled for the holiday season, ranging 
from representational events hosted at residences to a family 
event this weekend at the Chancery.  Specifically, the DCM 
reminded all sections to fully coordinate with RSO and/or the 
EAC on security requirements for said events. 
 
4.  (SBU)  On a related note, the Ambassador reiterated that 
the holiday season, and its host of events, call for members 
of the EAC to continue reinforcing to both their staffs and 
family members the need to maintain their current level of 
vigilance regarding personal security practices.  Similarly, 
RSO added the importance and effectiveness of immediately 
reporting suspicious activity or security-related incidents.

EAC Conclusion 
-------------- 
 
5.  (S/NF)  The EAC concluded that there have been no 
substantive changes in the local security environment since 
the last meeting held on December 11 (reftel), and that the 
Embassy\'s FPCON and already heightened security posture 
remain appropriate.  Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely 
aware of the need to monitor both the regional and local 
security and threat environments, and is prepared to take the 
necessary countermeasures should changes to either occur. 
AMB, DCM, RSO, RMAS, P/E, CONS, MGT, DAO, OMC (USDR), and ECA 
(USCENTAF) participated in the meeting.

Reason: 1.4(c). 
 
1.  (U)  In accordance with reftel B, paragraph 2, Embassy 
Muscat provides the following update to Oman\'s coverage in 
the 2003 Patterns of Global Terrorism (\"Patterns\") report: 
 
BEGIN TEXT 
 
Oman continued to provide public statements of support for 
the global war on terrorism, and has been responsive to 
requests for Coalition military and civilian support.  During 
the last three years, the Government of Oman has implemented 
a tight anti-money laundering regime, including surveillance 
systems designed to identify unusual transactions, with plans 
to require financial institutions to verify customer 
identities using sophisticated biometrics technology.  Omani 
financial authorities also remain committed to freezing the 
assets of any UN-listed individual found in Oman. 
 
Oman is a party to 10 of 12 international conventions and 
protocols relating to terrorism, but has not yet acceded to 
the other two, including the International Convention for the 
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. 
 
END TEXT 
 
NOTE:  (C)  \"There were no incidents of terrorist activity in 
Oman in 2003\" was redacted from the 2003 Patterns report. 
See paragraph 2.  END NOTE 
 
2.  (SBU)  Embassy Muscat also addresses the following 
information on Omani government counter-terrorism (\"CT\") 
efforts and attitudes, in response to relevant portions of 
reftel B, section 15: 
 
--  (SBU)  The Omani government was responsive to all 
coalition requests, both military and civilian. 
 
--  (SBU)  Oman has ratified 10 of the 12 international 
conventions and protocols against terrorism; the government 
of Oman said it intends to ratify the remaining two, 
including the International Convention for the Suppression of 
the Financing of Terrorism. 
 
--  (SBU)  The Omani government continued to provide public 
and private statements of support for the Global Coalition 
Against Terrorism.  For example, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs issued numerous statements condemning international 
acts of terrorism, including on December 7, 2004, following 
the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate General in Jeddah, 
Saudi Arabia; and on June 19, 2004, following the beheading 
of an American Hostage in Iraq.  Oman similarly denounced the 
beheading of a South Korean hostage in Iraq on June 23, 2004, 
and the terror attacks on a residential compound in Dhahran, 
Saudi Arabia, on May 30, 2004.  Additionally, Oman\'s Minister 
Responsible for Foreign Affairs joined GCC colleagues on 
September 14, 2004 in issuing a joint condemnation of 
international terrorism.  The Foreign Ministry likewise urged 
calm and an end to violence in Iraq on April 8, 2004. 
 
--  (SBU)  Over the last three years, the government of Oman 
has implemented a tight anti-money laundering regime, 
including surveillance systems designed to identify unusual 
transactions.  Sultan Qaboos Bin Said also issued a Royal 
Decree on July 6, 2004, announcing new statutes to block 
money laundering.  Furthermore, the Central Bank of Oman 
announced plans this year to require financial institutions 
to verify customer identities using sophisticated biometrics 
technology. 
 
--  (SBU)  Oman also supported the creation of a regional 
FATF-style body in Bahrain to combat financial crimes, which 
was inaugurated November 29-30, 2004 in Manama.  In addition, 
and pursuant to their U.N. commitments, the Omani financial 
authorities have committed to freezing the assets of any 
U.N.-listed terrorists found in Oman.  To date, however, none 
are known to have been located. 
 
--  (C)  Both the Royal Army of Oman (\"RAO\") and the Sultan\'s 
Special Force (\"SSF\") maintain missions to monitor and 
interdict terrorist (in addition to narcotics and illegal 
immigration) activity in areas along the joint Omani-Saudi 
Arabian and Yemeni borders.  Oman also deploys military 
forces for short and mid-term operations for specific CT 
missions.  Oman\'s Foreign Military Sales (\"FMS\") program has 
significantly enhanced CT capabilities for both the RAO and 
SSF. 
 
--  (C)  The Royal Oman Police (\"ROP\") Coast Guard is 
increasing its maritime interdiction capabilities and 
operations, which are believed to extend out 12 nautical 
miles.  However, both the Royal Navy of Oman and the Coast 
Guard are considering expanding their abilities to monitor 
commercial shipping farther off Oman\'s extensive coast. 
Again, Oman\'s FMS program has significantly enhanced CT 
capabilities for the Coast Guard. 
 
--  (SBU)  Other major CT efforts undertaken during the past 
year were centered on training, to include courses 
facilitated by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security\'s Office of 
Anti-Terrorism Assistance Programs (DS/ATA).  Specifically, 
officials from the Omani security apparatus, primarily the 
ROP, participated in DS/ATA-sponsored courses and 
consultations pertaining to forensic DNA analysis, explosive 
detector K-9\'s, interdiction of terrorist organizations, and 
mass casualty/weapons of mass destruction response. 
 
--  (C)  Utilizing previous DS/ATA training (e.g., Vital 
Installation Security), the ROP was extremely proactive in 
dealing with June 2004 threat information specific to 
Halliburton operations in Oman.  The Omani security apparatus 
continues to devote considerable resources to ensure the 
security of Halliburton officials and the oil rigs it 
supports.  NOTE: The attention to Halliburton is likely, at 
least in part, based on an understanding of the value of the 
company to Oman, as their services are relied upon almost 
exclusively to maintain the Sultanate\'s oil production.  END 
NOTE. 
 
--  (S/NF)  The Omani security and intelligence services take 
their work seriously and are well-funded and well-motivated. 
While there were no incidents of international or domestic 
terrorism in Oman since the Embassy\'s last submission, two 
separate - and previously unknown - al-Qa\'ida-associated 
terrorist cells were taken down in Oman, reflective of 
al-Qa\'ida\'s success in inspiring like-minded extremists to 
attack U.S. interests in the Arabian Peninsula.  The arrests 
are believed to have derailed the cells\' ongoing plots, one 
of which was aimed at U.S. interests in Oman, to include the 
U.S. Embassy.  In the past year, Oman has witnessed more 
activity as an operating area and staging ground for 
terrorists, and the fact that the two cells were previously 
unknown points to the possibility that similar cells may be 
present in Oman. 
 
--  (S/NF)  Oman\'s penchant for secrecy means that neither of 
the aforementioned arrests were made public; terrorists from 
both incidents were processed and received stiff sentences 
through secret legal proceedings.  Islamic extremism is 
viewed as a threat to stability in Oman at a time when 
government policy is to seek foreign investments and attract 
tourism.  The security and intelligence services are charged 
with protecting the implementation of these two critical 
components of Oman\'s foreign policy. 
 
--  (SBU)  The Embassy knows of no impediments to Omani 
prosecution and/or extradition of suspected terrorists. 
 
--  (S/NF)  The Omani government makes great efforts to 
combat extremism and violence-supporting ideology.  It takes 
a comprehensive view of its domestic extremist problem and 
most often seeks in the first instance to rehabilitate, with 
the help of community and tribal leaders, those Omani 
citizens discovered to harbor extremist tendencies or 
sympathies.  The Omani Government considers the problem of 
religious extremism to be rooted in economic, educational, 
and social reasons.  Thus, the Omani Government monitors the 
country\'s modernization closely and seeks to direct economic 
development into poorer parts of Oman that might be more 
susceptible to the extremists\' message. 
 
--  (S/NF)  The Grand Mufti of Oman is a well-known temperate 
figure in Islamic circles, and his moderating influence in 
the debate on the proper role of religion is accomplished 
with the blessing and support of Sultan Qaboos Bin Said. 
More directly, the Omani security services monitor the 
content of mosque sermons through a nation-wide network of 
reporting sources and warn those imams who delve into 
political matters or criticize other faiths not to stray into 
sensitive areas.  Those who persist will find themselves in 
an Omani court signing \"cease and desist\" orders, which carry 
stiff legal consequences if disobeyed. 
 
--  (SBU)  In summary, the Omani government - as a matter of 
policy and practice - remains steadfastly opposed to 
terrorism, international and domestic.

SUBJECT: OMAN: IFES ELECTIONS ASSESSMENT 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  Under the sponsorship of the Middle East 
Partnership Initiative (MEPI), the International Foundation 
for Electoral Systems (IFES) recently concluded an assessment 
visit to the Sultanate.  The team identified several key 
areas for potential electoral assistance, including a need 
for increased public awareness of both the electoral process 
and the role of the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Council.) 
END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Meetings with Election Commission, Parliamentarians 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (U) On December 14, a MEPI-sponsored IFES team arrived in 
Oman to conduct a technical assessment of the electoral 
process in the Sultanate.  Through a week-long series of 
governmental, legal, and private-sector meetings, Dr. Paul 
Harris, Ms. Aileen Hanel and Dr. John Duke Anthony elicited 
the opinions of election organizers and participants while 
tentatively identifying potential areas for strengthening. 
The team met with senior members of the government\'s election 
commission, with elected Majlis al-Shura (Consultative 
Council) and appointed Majlis al-Dawla (State Council) 
deputies, as well as academicians, legal consultants, and 
journalists. 
 
3. (SBU) As part of their country assessment, the team 
provided a debrief to the Embassy MEPI team prior to 
departure.  While preliminary, the IFES team identified 
several areas where technical assistance could help to 
strengthen the electoral process in Oman. 
 
---------------- 
Public Education 
---------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The IFES team members concluded that educating the 
public on the election process and the role of the 
Consultative Council should be a strategic component in 
election preparations for 2007.  (Note: One Majlis deputy 
told the delegation that Oman might seek to institute 
municipal elections before the next Shura elections in 2007. 
End note.)  The team suggested developing a civic education 
curriculum with the Education Ministry as well as promoting 
greater youth interaction, including children\'s visits to the 
Majlis al-Shura and having Majlis members speak at schools in 
their districts.  IFES noted, however, that the Education 
Ministry resisted playing a role in the 2003 elections. 
 
-------------------------- 
Voter and Candidate Apathy 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The public\'s widespread apathy towards the Majlis 
al-Shura and the elections pose considerable challenges to 
both candidates and the electoral process.  The assessment 
team found that citizens are generally unaware of who the 
candidates are, what the Majlis does, and why voting would be 
important.  Moreover, several interlocutors commented that 
some elected candidates lack basic qualifications, including 
a completed secondary-level education.  The IFES team also 
found that as a result of the low pay and lack of job 
security, potential qualified candidates were disinclined to 
run for office. 
 
------------------------ 
\"Campaign\" Strengthening 
------------------------ 
 
6. (SBU) IFES identified strict limitations on campaign 
activity as being one of most substantial obstacles in the 
electoral process in Oman.  It contributes immensely to the 
public\'s lack of awareness, the election of unqualified 
candidates, and general voter apathy. 
 
7. (U) The IFES team concluded that they had a productive 
week with enriching meetings.  They were pleased with the 
responsiveness of the Omani government to their questions, 
and with the candor of other interlocutors.  The team said 
that they intend to provide a summary of their assessment to 
the Embassy and the MEPI team by the end of March 2005. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) This visit constituted IFES\' second attempt at 
seeking to build a dialogue with the Omani government on 
election issues, and appears to have made a more favorable 
first impression than 2003\'s effort.  While it is premature 
to judge the feasibility of actual technical assistance 
programs, complicated by the disbandment of Oman\'s electoral 
commission, a patient and measured approach should make a 
substantial contribution to overcoming the government\'s 
skepticism about foreign involvement in this sensitive area.

Creating A Civil Society 
------------------------ 
 
1.The lead editorial in the government-owned Arabic daily \"Oman\" 
on December 14 was entitled \"NGOs and Civil Society\": 
 
\"In order for the relationship between governments and nonprofit 
organizations to be strong, governments must demonstrate respect 
for human rights, enforce the rule of law, and promote the 
development of civil society.  Since the end of the Cold War, 
there has been a new impetus to spread democratic principles 
throughout the world.  In the Arab world this has lead to calls 
for greater tolerance.  Some changes have already taken place. 
For example, phrases like `open communication\', `reform\', and 
`political freedom\' are now employed in the Arab world.  However, 
Arab societies must do more to create an environment in which 
civil society can grow. A positive first step would be to 
implement policies that promote the development of non-profit 
organizations that support civil society and community 
involvement.  If this is done, Arab societies will clearly be on 
their way to creating meaningful civil societies.\" 
 
----------------- 
The Thin Red Line 
----------------- 
 
2. On December 16, \"Oman\" carried an editorial entitled \"The 
Danger of Silence\": 
 
\"France\'s Al-Manar television station, which is owned and 
operated by Hezbollah, has been silenced.  Eutelsat, a French 
satellite company, has refused to host the station on its 
carrier.  Critics of Eutelsat claim that the French government 
pressured the company to stop hosting the station because the 
government felt threatened by the content of the station\'s 
reporting.  It appears that in the West there is a thin line 
between what is considered free speech and what is considered 
dangerous speech.  The difference depends on how sensitive the 
topic is.  Other examples of Islamic voices being silenced in the 
West are mosque imams in Germany, Islamic groups in England, and 
all of the above in the United States.  In America there is a 
very thin red line between the freedom to lift one\'s voice in 
expressing opinions and the risk of losing one\'s voice 
completely.\" 
 
------------------------------------- 
U.S. Hypocrisy Causes Arab Bankruptcy 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. An editorial appeared in the privately owned Arabic daily \"Al- 
Watan\" on December 19 entitled \"Bankruptcy through Excuses\": 
 
\"It is hard to take the United States seriously when it claims to 
stand for freedom of speech and political pluralism, but turns 
around and applies political pressure on certain media groups to 
prevent them from expressing their opinions....  This refers to 
the U.S. role in blocking the broadcasting of Al-Manar 
television.  The U.S. alleges that the station obtains funding 
from organizations on its terrorist list.  Essentially, Al-Manar 
has been prevented from broadcasting for attempting to obtain 
funds to finance its daily operation.  This incident shows that 
the America does not practice what it preaches.  The U.S. is 
attempting to silence Arabic media and replace them with its own. 
This explains the creation of Al-Hurra television and `Hi\' 
magazine.\"

SUBJECT: OMANI AMBASSADOR DENIES BAN OF WRITERS 
 
REF: MUSCAT 02180 
 
1. (U) The Omani Ambassador to the United States, Mohammed 
Ali al-Khusaiby, flatly denies that the Omani government has 
banned any writers (reftel).  In a December 8 reply to the 
New York-based NGO Committee for the Protection of 
Journalists (CPJ), the Omani Ambassador reaffirmed the 
Sultanate\'s commitment to its 1996 constitution (Basic 
Statute) that guarantees citizens civil, political, social 
and economic rights, including freedom of speech.  The 
Ambassador stated that the recent decision by Omani news and 
media outlets to remove articles by Mohammed al-Harthi and 
Abdullah al-Riyami were independent editorial decisions.  He 
further went on to highlight the \"great\" achievements of the 
Sultanate in the last thirty years and asked that the CPJ 
have \"due regard\" for the efforts made by the government for 
all the people of Oman. 
 
2. (U) In the Omani Internet chatroom Al-Sablah, Mohammed 
al-Harthi posted a rambling and critical response to the 
Ambassador\'s letter.  In his diatribe, al-Harthi referred to 
the freedom of press in the Basic Statute as \"ink on paper\" 
that has yet to be realized by journalists and writers in 
Oman.  He also blamed Oman\'s presence on international 
watchlists for the \"shallowness\" of the vision of those in 
charge at the Ministry of Information (MOI).  Al-Harthi went 
on to blast Ambassador al-Khusaiby\'s attempt to defend the 
government as indefensible.  Moreover, he alluded to articles 
of the Basic Statute that he believes violate freedom of 
expression.  (Note: Article 29 guarantees freedom of 
expression \"within the limits of the law.\"  Anything that 
leads to public discord or violates public morale and conduct 
or opposes the general law is prohibited.  End note.) 
Al-Harthi chastised the Ambassador for not getting his facts 
straight and being uninformed about the actions of the 
Ministry of Information.  He said that the Ambassador has 
attempted to \"reason the unreasonable and justify the 
unjustifiable\" by saying that the decision to ban writers is 
up to editors. 
 
3. (SBU) Poet Abdullah al-Riyami told Emboff that he intends 
to submit his own response to the Ambassador\'s letter.  Both 
writers have expressed their disbelief at the Omani 
Ambassador\'s apparent lack of information regarding the ban 
and continue to assert the MOI\'s behind-the-scenes role.  The 
two writers\' cause has become daily fodder for Al-Sablah and, 
in turn, has elevated the writers\' profile.

SUBJECT: MINISTRY CONSIDERS HUMAN RIGHTS NGO 
 
REF: MUSCAT 02079 
 
1.  (SBU) The Ministry of Social Development is considering 
the proposed establishment of a human rights center in Oman. 
In response to a letter from activist Abdullah al-Barami 
(reftel) (protect), the Ministry met with him December 6 to 
discuss the idea.  The Director of Charitable Associations 
and Funds requested al-Barami to provide a written disclosure 
to the Ministry on numerous details, including: 
 
-- Al-Barami\'s background; 
-- if al-Barami believes the general populace shares his 
interest; 
-- if al-Barami believes the Sultanate is in need of a human 
rights center and why; 
-- what is his goal behind establishing a center; 
-- his specific qualifications to run such a center; and 
-- a list of parties he has contacted in an \"official\" 
capacity for the center. 
 
2. (SBU) On the latter issue, the Ministry strongly reminded 
al-Barami that the Private Associations Law prohibits him 
from acting on behalf of an establishment that has not been 
announced.  (Note: Al-Barami signed his original letter to 
the Ministry using the title \"Director of the Human Rights 
Center,\" a presumption that evidently irked the bureaucrats. 
End note.)  In addition, the Ministry suggested to al-Barami 
that the establishment of a human rights center would be on 
the principles of an \"association\" and subject to the Private 
Associations Law, which requires a founding committee of not 
less than twenty members. 
 
3.  (SBU) Al-Barami responded promptly on December 8 to the 
Ministry\'s request for more information.  He provided details 
on his background, including his study of international 
relations at the University of Brussels in Cairo, that would 
qualify him as the center\'s principal founder.  In a petulant 
manner, however, he suggested that the Ministry conduct a 
public survey of its own to gauge the popularity of 
establishing a human rights center.  In another brusque 
statement, al-Barami reminded the Ministry that Oman is not a 
\"police country\" that prohibits him from speaking with other 
embassies and contacts friendly to the Sultanate.  Al-Barami 
provided copies of letters he sent to the U.S., British, and 
Dutch Embassies.  He marketed the establishment of a human 
rights center as a foreign policy achievement for Oman, 
saying it would serve to increase the popularity and 
credibility of the Sultanate both regionally and 
internationally. 
 
4.  (SBU) COMMENT: Al-Barami\'s barbed response to the 
Ministry may not help advance his cause.  Moreover, the 
Private Associations Law prohibits associations from engaging 
in politics or matters outside social, cultural or charitable 
activities -- a gray area for most human rights NGOs.  In 
light of this, and the considerably lengthy registration 
process, it is unlikely that a human rights \"association\" 
would be approved very quickly.  We are nevertheless 
encouraged that the Ministry did not seek to reject the 
proposal outright.  The Embassy will continue to monitor 
further developments and, where appropriate, provide advice 
and assistance.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core 
Emergency Action Committee December 22 to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture prior to the local holiday 
weekend.  Members of the EAC noted no substantive changes in 
the local security environment since the last meeting. 
Accordingly, the EAC agreed that the Embassy\'s already 
heightened security posture and FPCON remain appropriate. 
End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Security Environment 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  On December 22, the Ambassador chaired a meeting 
of the core Emergency Action Committee (\"EAC\") to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture prior to the local holiday 
weekend.  The meeting opened with a discussion of the local 
security situation, which the EAC continued to characterize 
as stable.  Members concurred that there have been no 
substantive changes in previously reported assessments of the 
security and threat environments. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Unsubstantiated Threat Information 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (S/NF)  RMAS briefed the EAC on an unsubstantiated threat 
to the American manager of Hunt Oil Company in Oman (reftel 
A).  In short, information alleges that, as of early October 
2004, the U.S. oil company received an anonymous letter (in 
the U.S.) requesting the withdrawal of their American Manager 
in Oman, who was in danger (NFI).  RMAS advised that they 
(RMAS) are in the process of attempting to verify the 
existence and/or content of the alleged threat letter at the 
headquarters level.  RMAS added that it remains unclear what, 
if anything, transpired with respect to the alleged threat. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  P/E noted that since early October 2004, his 
office has maintained routine contact with Hunt Oil\'s General 
Manager (\"GM\") in conjunction with Muscat American Business 
Council activity.  During this time, however, the GM did 
not/not express concern or awareness of any threats on him or 
Hunt Oil operations in Oman.  RSO and CONS, who also maintain 
limited contact with Hunt Oil\'s GM, affirmed the same.  It 
was also noted that the GM is an active affiliate member of 
the Muscat Employee Association\'s recreation facility, a 
venue that offers social contact with Embassy staff and 
families, as well as others from the private-sector American 
citizen community.  The fact that the GM does not appear to 
have discussed the alleged threat may call into question the 
threat\'s veracity, or supports the idea that he was not made 
aware of the threat, should it actually exist.  NOTE: Prior 
to the EAC meeting, the Economic/Commercial Officer attempted 
to contact Hunt Oil\'s GM on an unrelated matter; he was told 
that the GM was currently in the U.S. on holiday (NFI).  END 
NOTE. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Events, Holiday Services, and Vigilance 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  The EAC again conducted a review of the private 
and official events scheduled for the remainder of the 
holiday season.  DAO highlighted the upcoming visit of the 
U.S.S. Barry (DDG 52), a non-saluting Destroyer, to Port 
Sultan Qaboos in Muscat from December 23-28.  As with all 
U.S. military ship visits to Oman, security is being closely 
coordinated with the Royal Oman Police (\"ROP\") Coast Guard. 
 
6.  (SBU)  RSO confirmed that a list of religious holiday 
services expected to have a significant American attendance 
was forwarded to ROP Operations.  RSO also took the 
opportunity to reiterate that members of the EAC must 
continue reinforcing to both their staffs and family members 
the need for vigilance regarding all aspects of personal 
security, including the need to maintain a low profile and to 
remain unpredictable.  Likewise, RSO re-emphasized the 
importance of immediately reporting suspicious activity or 
security-related incidents, especially those involving 
suspected surveillance, to Post One. 
 
--------------------------- 
Lessons Learned from Jeddah 
--------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  RSO distributed copies of, and led a discussion on 
reftel B, regarding lessons learned from the December 6 
terrorist attack on U.S. Consulate General Jeddah.  In 
addition to actions already taken in response to previous 
reporting of the attack, e.g., incorporation of an additional 
safehaven/area in the motorpool (reftel D), the EAC will use 
Jeddah\'s lessons learned to assist with their ongoing review 
of avenues to enhance and sustain the Embassy\'s security 
posture. 
 
-------------- 
EAC Conclusion 
-------------- 
 
8.  (S/NF)  The EAC concluded that there have been no 
substantive changes in the local security environment since 
the last meeting held on December 18 (reftel C), and that the 
Embassy\'s FPCON and already heightened security posture 
remain appropriate.  Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely 
aware of the need to monitor both the regional and local 
security and threat environments, and is prepared to take the 
necessary countermeasures should changes to either occur. 
AMB, A/DCM, RSO (Duty Officer), RMAS, P/E, CONS, A/MGT, DAO, 
OMC (USDR), and ECA (USCENTAF) participated in the meeting.

SUBJECT: OMAN ONLINE: DRUG USE, WORK IN IRAQ, AND HINDUS IN OMAN 
 
1. Summary:  The Omani Internet chat room \"Sablat al-Arab\" -- or 
simply \"Al-Sablah\" -- is the liveliest and most comprehensive 
Arabic-language forum for political and social discourse in the 
country, touching on issues and personalities rarely addressed in 
the conventional media.  While not totally free, nor wholly 
reflective of Omani public opinion, Al-Sablah nevertheless offers 
a worthwhile window into the hot topics and unvarnished views of 
the day.  This edition of Oman Online contains the following 
topics: 
 
--- Drug use/trafficking in Oman 
--- Ministry of Manpower Warns against Iraq 
--- Hindus in Oman 
 
End summary. 
 
------------ 
High On Oman 
------------ 
 
2. Al-Sablah members expressed concern that the government may 
not be doing enough to control drug trafficking in Oman.  One 
member stated, \"We wonder what steps the government is taking to 
control drug trafficking and use.\"  Another urged the government 
to \"initiate a media campaign to warn the public of the dangers 
of drug use and explain how one becomes addicted.\"  Still another 
wrote, \"There should be strategies to treat drug addicts.\"  Other 
participants stated that the drug problem in Oman is not hard 
drugs, but the use of household items to get high.  One Al-Sablah 
subscriber commented, \"The use of things like medicine, perfumes, 
creams, and body lotions to escape reality is of most concern 
here in Oman.\" 
 
------------------ 
No To Jobs In Iraq 
------------------ 
 
3. The Ministry of Manpower recently published notices in the 
major dailies warning Omanis that the high level of violence in 
Iraq made it inadvisable to travel to that country in search of 
employment.  An Al-Sablah subscriber commented on the notice, \"We 
appreciate the Ministry\'s deep concern for our lives, but we ask 
ourselves why are many Omanis attracted to the offers of work in 
Iraq.\"  Some members doubted that any Omanis would be willing to 
go to Iraq, while others stated, \"Traveling to Iraq would be an 
act of infidels.\"  According to one participant, \"Anyone that 
goes to Iraq to work with coalition forces should be ashamed of 
himself for supporting the crusaders against Muslims.\"  Others 
supported the announcement writing, \"Any step taken by the 
Ministry to save the lives of Omanis should be supported.\" 
 
------------------ 
Integrating Hindus 
------------------ 
 
4. Al-Sablah also raised the issue of Hindu expatriates in Oman. 
\"How can we allow ourselves to live with Hindus and permit them 
to build temples in our country?\" asked one participant.  Another 
subscriber stated, \"Hindus are not loyal to their own 
communities.  If they were, they would not have emigrated to our 
shores.  If they obtain Omani nationality, they will not be loyal 
to this country.\"  However, a majority of the participants 
expressed sympathy for Hindu expatriates by stating, \"These 
people left India a long time ago.  They have integrated 
themselves into Omani society.\"  Another member wrote, \"In most 
regions you will find Hindus and Omanis coming together to 
celebrate weddings and mourn at funerals.  Surely, they are part 
of this society.\"  Other writers commented, \"Hindus are very 
efficient and hardworking.  Their shops are open from the early 
morning to late at night, and you do not have to worry about them 
cheating you.\"

2.  (SBU)  On December 26, the Ambassador chaired a meeting 
of the core Emergency Action Committee (\"EAC\") to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture following the local holiday 
weekend.  The meeting opened with a discussion of the local

as stable.  Likewise, the EAC noted no new threat reporting 
specific to Oman.  Members, including Duty Officer, cited no 
security incidents among their staffs or family members over 
the weekend, and CONS confirmed that there were no security 
incidents or security-related queries from the private 
American citizen community.

Unsubstantiated Threat Information: Update 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (S/NF)  RMAS provided an update on the unsubstantiated 
threat to the American manager of Hunt Oil Company in Oman 
(reftel A and B).  In short, information alleged that, as of 
early October 2004, the oil company received an anonymous 
letter in their U.S. office requesting the withdrawal of 
their American Manager in Oman, who was in danger (NFI). 
RMAS advised that Hunt Oil\'s U.S. office claimed not/not to 
be familiar with such allegations.  RMAS added that tearline 
will be passed to the Regional Security Office in Sana\'a, 
Yemen, where Hunt Oil\'s regional security manager is

4.  (SBU)  The EAC also discussed reftel C, regarding Embassy 
Muscat\'s upcoming Crisis Management Exercise, scheduled for 
February 13-14, 2004.  A response to the action request, 
based on the EAC\'s discussion, will be sent to FSI/LMS/CMT

Continued Vigilance

5.  (SBU)  Prior to concluding the meeting, RSO reiterated 
that members of the EAC must continue reinforcing to both 
their staffs and family members the need for vigilance 
regarding all aspects of personal security, including the 
need to maintain a low profile and to remain unpredictable. 
Likewise, RSO re-emphasized the importance of immediately 
reporting suspicious activity or security-related incidents, 
especially those involving suspected surveillance, to Post 
One.

EAC Conclusion 
-------------- 
 
6.  (S/NF)  The EAC concluded that there have been no 
substantive changes in previously reported assessments of the 
local security environment since the last meeting held on 
December 22 (reftel A), and that the Embassy\'s FPCON and 
already heightened security posture remain appropriate. 
Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely aware of the need to 
monitor both the regional and local security and threat 
environments, and is prepared to take the necessary 
countermeasures should changes to either occur.  AMB, A/DCM, 
RSO (Duty Officer), A/MGT, RMAS, P/E, PAO, CONS, MSG, DAO, 
OMC (USDR), and ECA (USCENTAF) participated in the meeting.

The Cost of Patience 
-------------------- 
 
1. The lead editorial in the privately -owned Arabic daily \"Al- 
Watan\" on December 24 was entitled \"American Patience\": 
 
\"In 1983, when 240 Americans died in a suicide bombing in Beirut, 
former President Reagan immediately called for the withdrawal of 
all American troops stationed there.  Today, despite daily 
casualties in Iraq, President Bush does nothing for the safety of 
his troops except pray for the ones that have fallen.  The war in 
Iraq has claimed more American lives than any conflict since 
Vietnam, but political experts postulate that younger Americans 
have forgotten the lessons of Vietnam, which their parents 
learned the hard way.  Therefore, they do not fully understand 
the impact of war upon U.S. society, and do not feel compelled to 
demand the return of U.S. troops the way older generations did in 
the past.  Instead of demanding action from their government, 
younger generations of Americans patiently wait for Bush to do 
something to make things better in Iraq, while soldiers continue 
to die.  The Bush Administration relies on this \"patience\" in 
order to remain in Iraq.\" 
 
---------------- 
Voting For Peace 
---------------- 
 
2. On December 25, \"Al-Watan\" also carried an editorial entitled 
\"A Poll For The Sake Of The Peace\": 
 
\"The initial results of the Palestinian municipal elections 
indicate that long-suffering Palestinian voters have become 
politically mature, and are using this maturity and experience to 
guide their ballots.  The whole world is moving towards putting 
reform before resistance, and Palestine will be a shining example 
of this trend.  In the past, Palestinians preferred to take up 
arms instead of taking up pens, since that is what their leaders 
told them they must do.  No longer will Palestinians be used as 
pawns to keep their own autocratic rulers in power.  Today the 
Palestinians have the chance to make a peaceful start by electing 
new leaders democratically.\" 
 
------------------------- 
New Leadership, New Rules 
------------------------- 
 
3. An editorial appeared in the government-owned Arabic daily 
\"Oman\" on December 26 entitled \"Shuffling Cards in Iraq\": 
 
\"It is no exaggeration to describe life in Iraq as difficult and 
even tragic.  However, after twenty months of being under 
Coalition control, and with elections close at hand, it is 
important that the cards change hands to a new leadership in 
Iraq.  Iraq must become a stable and strong country again. 
Unfortunately, Iraq will never reach this stage under the current 
situation of daily violence and armed conflict, and with the 
continued destruction of societal infrastructure.  Bringing about 
a change for peace in Iraq should be the first goal, and the new 
Iraqi leadership should be characterized not only by its ability 
to rule militarily, but also by its ability to ensure the rule of 
law.\"

Convention of the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings was

the G-8 Ambassadors to decide, A/DCM suggested to Hill that 
the CTAG consider requesting a group meeting with Ambassador 
Talib to further emphasize interest in Oman\'s ratification of

suggestion, noting that the April 2005 CTAG meeting is to be 
devoted to issues of terror finance in the Middle East region.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) On December 25-26, Indian Minister of External Affairs 
Natwar Singh met with Sultan Qaboos and various government 
ministers to boost bilateral relations.  Oman formally 
announced its backing of India\'s bid for a permanent seat on 
the UN Security Council, and the two parties pledged to 
continue joint naval exercises.  During the brief visit, both 
countries signed a landmark treaty of extradition, reviewed 
opportunities for increasing India\'s presence in the oil and 
gas sector, and discussed further cooperation in the areas of 
information technology, trade and investment, and labor. 
Singh\'s stay ended with the much anticipated groundbreaking 
of the new Indian Embassy next door to the U.S. mission.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
---------------- 
THE INSIDE SCOOP 
---------------- 
 
2. (C) In a December 27 meeting with the Ambassador, Minister 
Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi (YBA) 
characterized Indian Minister of External Affairs Natwar 
Singh\'s visit as having gone \"very well.\"  Bin Alawi said 
Singh was extremely positive on Indo-U.S. relations and the 
course of confidence building with Pakistan, noting that 
Singh was looking forward to the meeting of the Indian and 
Pakistani PM\'s at the South Asian Summit in January.  Bin 
Alawi confirmed that Oman had formally pledged to support 
India\'s bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. 
On a minor note, the Minister said a diplomatic dinner 
scheduled for Christmas in Singh\'s honor was canceled in 
mourning for the death of former Indian PM Narasimha Rao. 
 
------------------- 
COOPERATION ABOUNDS 
------------------- 
 
3. (U) On December 25, the Indian minister met with Sultan 
Qaboos to deepen bilateral relations and reaffirm India\'s 
commitment to peace and stability in the region.  Oman 
expressed interest in India\'s information technology, 
pharmaceuticals, and bio-technology sectors.  Reaching a 
milestone in their bilateral relations, the two countries 
signed a treaty of extradition.  Moreover, Oman participated 
fully in the 50th anniversary celebrations of India\'s 
diplomatic presence in Oman. 
 
4. (U) Singh and Commerce and Industry Minister Maqbool bin 
Ali Sultan focused on increasing trade and investment, both 
bilaterally and regionally, including building further on the 
success of the $1 billion joint venture Oman-India Fertilizer 
project and resolving outstanding labor issues.  In a 
subsequent meeting with Sayyid Badr bin Saud al-Busaidi, 
Minister Responsible for Defense Affairs, the two parties 
reviewed ongoing defense ties, particularly the continuation 
of joint naval exercises and increased training of Omanis in 
Indian defense institutions. 
 
5. (U) In his meeting with Dr. Mohammed bin Hamad al-Romhi, 
Minister of Oil and Gas, Singh sought to collaborate more 
closely in the extractive industries sector.  Much of the 
talk centered around enhancing India\'s presence in the 
hydrocarbon sector of Oman, primarily through onshore and 
offshore exploration for oil and gas and the provision of 
services and supplies for current drilling operations.  In a 
brief meeting with Sayyid Haitham bin Tariq, Minister of 
Heritage and Culture, Singh discussed potential avenues to 
further bilateral cultural understanding, including 
undertaking joint research of archival documents and 
publications on the historical ties between the two 
countries.  Finally, the two nations signed a memo of 
understanding between the State Audit Institution of Oman and 
the Comptroller and Auditor General of India for cooperation 
in audit matters. 
 
------------- 
NEW NEIGHBORS 
------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The Minister\'s program culminated in the much 
anticipated groundbreaking of the new Indian Embassy.  The 
future chancery will include the ambassador\'s residence as 
well as a 500-seat multipurpose auditorium for cultural and 
social occasions.  Yusuf bin Alawi was in attendance as 
Minister Singh laid the cornerstone in the final hours of his 
whirlwind visit. YBA said Singh was buoyant at the notion of 
putting India\'s mission in the vacant lot immediately between 
the U.S. and UK embassies, amongst the \"Superpowers.\"  Bin 
Alawi said he did not have the heart to tell Singh that 
Turkey will eventually build a new embassy between the 
Indians and UK. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) While intemperate Omanis are still occasionally heard 
to grumble about the \"Hindu\" presence among the resident 
expatriate community, Indo-Omani relations are quite strong 
(reftel) and appear to be deepening.  From Oman\'s 
perspective, India is more than simply a source of cheap 
manual labor.  Rather, it is increasingly a source of foreign 
direct investment in the expanding gas-fed industries, as 
well as a ready market for fertilizer and other future Omani 
exports.  Oman also banks on India\'s IT expertise for local 
human resource development, with an increasing number of 
formal relationships between technical training institutes. 
And despite Oman\'s close historical connections to Pakistan 
(primarily Baluchistan), the Sultanate does not shy away from 
military linkages to New Delhi or supporting India\'s bid for 
a UNSC seat.

1.  (SBU)  The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core 
Emergency Action Committee December 29 to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture prior to the local holiday 
weekend.  Members of the EAC noted no substantive changes in

Local Security and Holiday Vigilance 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (SBU)  On December 29, the Ambassador chaired a meeting 
of the core Emergency Action Committee (\"EAC\") to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture prior to the local holiday 
weekend.  The meeting opened with a discussion of the local 
and regional security situations; the EAC continued to 
characterize the former as stable.  Likewise, the EAC cited 
no new threat reporting specific to Oman or the New Year\'s 
holiday.  With respect to the latter, RSO reviewed security 
coverage for an Embassy-related New Year\'s Eve function, and 
advised he will confirm that Royal Oman Police Operations is 
familiar with local hotel-sponsored events expected to draw 
an increased number of Americans, from both the official and 
private citizen communities. 
 
3.  (C)  Members also discussed known facts of the December 
24 attempted attack reported by Embassy Sana\'a (reftel A). 
The Ambassador noted that the incident, while not carried out 
by an organized terrorist group, reflects the potential for 
other ad hoc-type attacks by individuals, and serves as a 
clear reminder of the need for sustained vigilance regarding 
personal security practices.  Accordingly, the Ambassador 
asked members of the EAC to continue reinforcing this 
necessity to both their staffs and family members - 
particularly during the holiday season, when the mood may 
convey a false appearance of complacency.

4.  (SBU)  Prior to concluding the meeting, CONS distributed 
a request for all sections to provide data for the annual

 The completed report will be submitted before the end of 
January 2005.

already heightened security posture remain appropriate. 
Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely aware of the need to

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The wave of public excitement cresting with Oman\'s 
unprecedented finish in a regional soccer tournament has 
boiled over into uncharacteristic manifestations of 
spontaneous crowds and flag-waving patriotism.  In a country 
bereft of past sports successes, the Gulf Cup tournament 
unleashed a seldom seen burst of national pride and 
enthusiasm.  In a carefully manicured society as Oman, the 
temporary relaxation of social norms has also fed some 
visions of a more political nature.  End summary. 
 
--------------------- 
A Strange New Feeling 
--------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Against the frenzied backdrop of soccer, Omanis have 
found a unique - albeit brief - avenue of personal 
expression.  In all facets of life, Omanis great and humble 
have been engrossed with the recent Gulf Cup Finals, in which 
the Sultanate made a triumphant journey to the final match 
December 24 only to lose in a tense overtime penalty kick to 
Qatar.  It is not the match that Omanis are talking about 
now, but the public outbursts of expression that have led up 
to and followed the match. 
 
3. (U) In their exuberant celebrations over soccer, some 
Omanis found a tempting avenue to push social boundaries. 
Quiet streets, plain automobiles and sedate cafes gave way 
during the tournament to colorful endorsements for the Omani 
soccer team.  Public displays of expression normally 
prohibited, such as adorning one\'s car with stickers or 
flags, have become commonplace in the last few weeks; cafes 
have hosted large gatherings for the public to root their 
team on; and police have looked the other way as Omani youth 
precariously hanging out car windows squealed their tires 
down city streets.  The intoxicating feel of national fervor 
reached its peak upon the team\'s return to Muscat December 
25, as the city\'s main thoroughfare gave way to legions of 
fans who turned out to welcome their heroes home.  Government 
ministers, parliamentarians, and even the Sultan have heaped 
accolades and awards upon the team in the days following. 
 
4. (SBU) While this may sound like an average occurrence to 
patriotic Americans enured to sports success, most Omanis 
have never experienced the phenomenon of the past weeks in 
their entire lives.  (In 34 years, Oman never placed higher 
than 4th in this tournament of eight nations.  Its tiny 
Olympic teams have rarely won a medal.)  When the Sultan 
created the Ministry of Sports earlier this year, some Omani 
interlocutors hailed the initiative for its potential to 
forge a greater sense of national (vice tribal) identity. 
The oceans of Omani red, green and white banners evident of 
late indicate the theory is a sound one. 
 
------------------ 
A Taste of Freedom 
------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) But these paroxysms of libertarian behavior may have 
whetted other appetites.  One Omani dissident, with some 
hyperbole, posted on the Internet message board \"Al Sablah\" 
that the spontaneous public displays are \"an achievement in 
expression for Oman, where citizens feel oppressed and 
depressed from all the chains of control imposed by the 
government.\"  Numerous respondents noted that, if Omanis can 
block traffic and close the roads in celebration, then maybe 
they can do it in protest as well.  A week later however, the 
cheers have faded and the flags have all been put away. 
Omanis have returned to their quiet-natured state while 
police once again enforce \"civility\" in the streets. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) The free-wheeling nature of the past weeks will 
likely stick in the minds of many young Omanis and possibly 
feed an appetite for similar experiences in the future. The 
Ministry of Sports is probably not the only Omani government 
institution pondering whether those

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) FM Yusuf bin Alawi shared his views with the 
Ambassador on Iran\'s relations with the region, noting his 
interest in visiting Tehran but ruling out a state visit by 
the Sultan.  He is optimistic that Qatar will take positive 
action to rein in abuses by the Al Jazeera network, and is 
likewise hopeful that good news from Palestine may soon draw 
attention away from Iraq.  Oman is encouraged by interim 
Palestinian leader Abbas\' assessment of the situation in the 
territories, and with the improved transparency of the PA. 
Bin Alawi was expansive on what he views as Saudi Arabia\'s 
disastrous handling of its relations with GCC states over 
free trade agreements and other matters.  He sees Iran as 
doing a better job engaging with the international community 
than Riyadh.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) On December 27, Oman\'s Minister Responsible for 
Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi (YBA) received the Ambassador 
on short notice to discuss a number of demarches (septels), 
which turned into a 70-minute meeting reviewing a number of 
key regional issues.  Ref A reported the Minister\'s 
particular concerns over the emergency Arab League 
ministerial scheduled for the first week of January. 
 
---- 
Iran 
---- 
 
3. (C) YBA appreciated recent statements by the Secretary 
that the USG would seek diplomatic means to resolve its 
disputes with Iran, saying that Oman was prepared to help in 
whatever way it could.  Both he and the Sultan were offering 
\"advice\" (NFI) to Tehran.  Offering no details on the 
Sultan\'s letter to Pres. Khatami (hand-delivered November 21 
by the Sultan\'s special envoy for Iranian affairs, Abdulaziz 
al-Rowas), YBA was firm in saying that the Sultan had no 
plans to return the state visit Khatami paid to Oman in early 
October.  Bin Alawi, on the other hand, has thoughts of 
visiting Iran but no definite dates.  Should YBA travel, he 
said he would like to call on Ayatollah Khamenei in addition 
to the \"usual suspects\" (the President, Foreign Minister, 
Majles Speaker), and his old interlocutor Rafsanjani. 
Calling on the Ayatollah, he said, was not typically done by 
foreign officials, but Bin Alawi said he understood that the 
Supreme Leader was angry at being \"neglected\" by Tehran\'s 
guests.  (Note: The Minister recounted having nearly met 
Khamenei during the Iran-Iraq war years when the latter was 
president, but that Khamenei had moved to a location too near 
the front lines for YBA\'s taste.  End note.)  YBA has not 
traveled to Iran in over a year. 
 
4. (C) YBA said Iran is currently preoccupied with its IAEA 
issues and Iraq.  He noted the porous borders between Iran 
and Iraq, and the illicit smuggling between the two states 
that originated in the Iran-Iraq war years and that has 
intensified in the current situation in view of the lucrative 
opportunities.  He sees a degree of Iranian involvement in 
Iraqi affairs as unavoidable, but manageable if Iran is not 
\"backed into a corner.\"  In fact, he thinks Tehran is either 
incapable or afraid of intervening to control the border 
areas completely.  YBA sees factions within Iran as split 
between backing al-Sadr or al-Hakim, but feels Iran must be 
aware of the fact that Iraqi Shia are determined to wrest 
dominance in Shia religious affairs away from Qom and restore 
it to Najaf.  The Minister is emphatic in noting that Iraq\'s 
Shia are in no way \"dominated\" by Iran. 
 
---------- 
Al Jazeera 
---------- 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador noted DNSA Hadley\'s appreciation of his 
chat with YBA December 5 (ref B), and sought the Minister\'s 
further views on how to address the Al Jazeera problem.  YBA 
said he understood Qatar had set up a working group to try to 
resolve abuses, and that he planned to raise the matter 
specifically with the Qataris when he travels to Doha January 
8.  Acknowledging that Al Jazeera crosses the boundaries 
between free speech and promoting extremism, YBA was 
optimistic that Qatar will \"do something.\"  He was likewise 
hopeful that the positive developments coming out of 
Palestine would give Al Jazeera some good news upon which to 
focus, shifting some of the spotlight away from Iraq. 
--------- 
Palestine 
--------- 
6. (C) YBA noted that the Sultan had given USD 1 million to 
Palestine to assist with the election process.  He said Oman 
is greatly encouraged by Abbas, Qorei, and Finance Minister 
Fayyad for their improved transparency, bringing about a \"new 
day\" compared to the Arafat years.  Abbas, who visited Muscat 
December 18-19, gave the Sultan an encouraging readout on his 
ability to keep Hamas within acceptable norms of behavior as 
well as to unify Palestine\'s disparate security services. 
 
------------------ 
Arab League Issues 
------------------ 
 
7. (C) YBA\'s concerns over the upcoming Emergency Arab League 
ministerial were reported ref A.  He further noted that Iraq 
will dominate discussions primarily because \"there is nothing 
right now\" to say about Palestine.  While Oman stands firmly 
behind the January 30 Iraq election date, YBA continued to 
express opposition to any notion of providing Arab forces to 
Iraq.  He said Iraq is gradually improving with each passing 
day, and what it most needs now is a greater Iraqi police 
presence on the streets - not more armies.  The sooner 
Coalition forces melt into the background, the greater 
legitimacy the Iraqi government will enjoy. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Saudi Arabia\'s Disastrous GCC Policies 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Asked about the December 20 GCC Summit and Saudi 
Arabia\'s unhappiness with the USG pursuit of bilateral free 
trade agreements (FTAs), bin Alawi admitted that he missed 
Saudi FM Saud al-Faisal\'s speech at the ministerial.  YBA is 
nevertheless of the view that Saudi Arabia\'s dispute is more 
with the U.S. than with Bahrain or other potential FTA 
partners.  At least in the past, YBA said in reference to the 
1990\'s, the view in the region was that being a squeaky wheel 
was the best way to win attention from Washington.  Such is 
Riyadh\'s tactic now, he believes.  He also believes there may 
be positive references in the U.S.-Bahrain FTA to Iran (NFI), 
that may be provoking Riyadh\'s ire.  Bin Alawi said Saudi 
Arabia nevertheless badly misplayed its hand with the other 
GCC states and has now isolated itself on the FTA issue \"five 
against one,\" made worse by Riyadh\'s blockage of a gas 
pipeline project between Kuwait and Qatar.  Riyadh\'s approach 
has backfired so badly, the Minister said, that Bahrain and 
Qatar are actively considering construction of a new bridge 
simply to bypass the need to enter Saudi territory.  An even 
more ambitious project to build a bridge between the UAE and 
Qatar was motivated by the same purpose of cementing trade 
ties among the non-Saudi members of the GCC.  The Minister 
observed that Iran\'s stock with the international community 
appears to be in even better shape than Saudi Arabia\'s. 
 
9. (C) Bin Alawi observed that the Al Saud are restricting 
debate on foreign policy issues to the top family circles, 
which only serves to stifle dialogue.  YBA had previously 
opined that FM Saud al-Faisal did not agree with Riyadh\'s 
stand on reform at the IISS Forum in early December.  He 
recounted having questioned his Saudi colleague on why the 
Saudi National Dialogue effort was not headed by a royal 
family member, since royals could rise above petty tribal 
disputes likely to be raised in such dialogues.  Despite the 
fact that Oman\'s ruling dynasty has successfully employed 
that tactic for over two centuries, YBA said Saud replied 
\"that doesn\'t work in Saudi Arabia.\"  Bin Alawi observes that 
the Saudi government is now trying to buy off a delay in 
critical reform decisions by distributing more of the current 
oil profit windfall among the unemployed.  Not only does that 
tactic merely delay difficult decisions, but it also worsens 
the situation since those support payments will be viewed as 
an entitlement by the time oil prices eventually decline.

Reason: 1.4 (b, d). 
 
1. (C)  Team Muscat was delighted to learn of your transit of 
Oman en route to the tsunami-stricken Asia region.  In the 
event your brief refueling stop in Muscat offers the 
opportunity for an airport meeting with Minister Responsible 
for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi, we offer the following 
background on Oman\'s position regarding issues of regional 
concern.  You last met with the Minister in September in New 
York; he was unable to attend the Forum for the Future event 
in Rabat.  Bin Alawi held a productive bilateral meeting with 
DNSA Steve Hadley in Manama on December 5 (ref A). 
 
-------------- 
Tsunami Relief 
 
SIPDIS 
-------------- 
 
The Omani government has yet to announce any disaster relief 
package, though religious officials have encouraged 
charitable contributions and various local private 
organizations - including the expatriate Asian community - 
have begun charity drives.  While the USG has not had to 
avail itself thus far of access to Omani bases for disaster 
relief, doing so would not pose a problem.  Out of Oman\'s 
population of 2.3 million, approximately half a million 
persons are expatriates, many of whom come from South and 
East Asia. 
 
---- 
Iraq 
---- 
 
While initially strongly recommending against OIF, Oman 
supports all efforts to restore Iraqi stability and 
prosperity and its transition to a democratic government. 
Bin Alawi opposes any efforts (particularly from states like 
Jordan and Saudi Arabia) to seek a postponement in the 
January 30 election date, viewing many of those calling for a 
delay as being overly suspicious of Iran\'s links to Iraqi 
Shia or in favor of increasing Wahhabist influence in Iraq. 
The Minister takes for granted a certain degree of Iranian 
interest in Iraqi affairs, but vows that Iraq\'s Shia 
community is not beholden to and in fact is somewhat in 
competition with Iran.  Bin Alawi opposes calls for foreign, 
especially Arab, troops for Iraq, saying the country most 
vitally needs more Iraqi policemen - not foreign soldiers. 
Oman has pledged USD 5 million for Iraq\'s reconstruction, but 
cites competing requests from Iraqi entities for the 
non-disbursal of those funds.  Oman supports Iraq\'s 
participation in international fora and has received an Iraqi 
Ambassador.  Oman\'s voice will be supportive of USG positions 
at the upcoming emergency Arab League ministerial on Iraq. 
Bin Alawi sees steady improvement in Iraq and expresses 
confidence in the eventual outcome.  He likewise welcomes 
progress in Afghanistan\'s stabilization and transition. 
 
---- 
Iran 
---- 
 
The Minister told me December 27 (ref B) how happy he was to 
hear recent statements from you that the U.S. would handle 
its concerns with Iran through diplomatic means.  Given its 
shared stewardship of the strategic Strait of Hormuz, Oman 
sees little choice but to seek a congenial if not close 
relationship with Iran.  While their bilateral interaction 
revolves primarily around border security issues 
(particularly the movement of people and goods by sea), 
President Khatami made a state visit to Oman in October.  Bin 
Alawi attributes Iran\'s objectionable behavior (IAEA, 
Hezbollah, Iraq) to its demand to be treated seriously as a 
regional power by the international community.  He urges 
direct USG-Iranian dialogue as the best means of tempering 
Tehran\'s negative inclinations, and is willing to play a 
helpful role to that end if ever asked by the USG.  He has 
long maintained that it would be in our collective best 
interests if Iran were allowed to join the WTO in that it 
would focus some of their energies towards complying with a 
set of international rules.  Bin Alawi is contemplating a 
visit to Iran in the coming months, despite his confidence 
that the next Iranian president will be a political 
conservative acceptable to Ayatollah Khamenei. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Free Trade Agreement-GCC-Saudi Arabia 
------------------------------------- 
 
Oman and the UAE will formally begin negotiations with USTR 
on a free trade agreement (FTA) in March.  The International 
Trade Commission hosts a public hearing on the proposed Oman 
FTA in Washington on January 14, during which Omani 
Ambassador al-Khosaibi will testify.  Bin Alawi joins the 
rest of the Omani government in firmly backing FTA 
negotiations, signaling its willingness to adopt the Bahrain 
FTA model.  The Minister is sharply critical of Saudi 
Arabia\'s bumbling efforts to force the GCC into a 
multilateral negotiation on the U.S. FTA, and sees Riyadh\'s 
actions as more directed at Washington than its GCC 
neighbors.  Bin Alawi welcomes USG efforts through the Middle 
East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) to promote \"modernization\" 
in Arab societies (he hates the word \"reform\"), but looks 
down on Riyadh for what he sees as the Al Saud\'s blindness 
toward the need to foster change.  The Minister is critical 
of the Al Jazeera satellite network based in Qatar, but is 
hopeful Doha will take steps to rein in the channel.  He will 
discuss the matter with the Qataris when he travels there 
January 8. 
 
---------------- 
Palestine, Sudan 
---------------- 
 
Palestinian interim leader Mahmoud Abbas paid a recent visit 
to Muscat, impressing the Omanis with his pledge to unify the 
Palestinian security services and to hold to a much higher 
standard of honesty and transparency than Arafat\'s regime. 
While no more fond of Sharon than he was of Arafat, bin Alawi 
has some optimism for progress in Middle East peace for the 
first time since 2001.  He recently received a mid-level 
Israeli MFA official for a quiet bilateral, and told us that 
Oman contributed USD 1 million to support Palestinian 
elections.  Oman has also maintained a certain degree of 
interest in both the Sudanese peace talks and the Darfur 
crisis, having pledged USD 1 million to support Sudanese 
relief efforts.

-------------------- 
Security Environment 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  On January 2, the Ambassador chaired a meeting of 
the core Emergency Action Committee (\"EAC\") to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture following the local holiday 
weekend.  The meeting opened with a discussion of the local 
and regional security situations; the EAC continued to 
characterize the former as stable.  Likewise, the EAC noted 
no new threat reporting specific to Oman.  Members cited no 
security incidents among their staffs or family members over 
the weekend, and CONS confirmed that there were no security 
incidents or security-related queries from the private 
American citizen community. 
 
---------------------- 
Jeddah Lessons Learned 
---------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  In furtherance of the EAC\'s previous discussions 
on lessons learned from the December 6 terrorist attack on 
U.S. Consulate General Jeddah, RSO distributed copies of, and 
led a detailed discussion on, reftel B.  In addition to 
actions already taken in response to previous reporting of 
the attack (reftel C), the EAC will use Jeddah\'s lessons 
learned as part of their ongoing review of avenues to enhance 
and sustain the Embassy\'s security posture. 
 
------------------- 
Continued Vigilance 
------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  RSO reiterated that members of the EAC must 
continue reinforcing to both their staffs and family members 
the need for vigilance regarding all aspects of personal 
security, including the need to maintain a low profile and to 
remain unpredictable.  Likewise, RSO re-emphasized the 
importance of immediately reporting suspicious activity or 
security-related incidents -- especially those involving 
suspected surveillance -- to Post One. 
 
----------------- 
Physical Security 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Prior to concluding the meeting, RSO advised that 
the trench barrier systems which run along the sides of the 
Chancery compound, where stand-off is reduced by vacant 
diplomatic lots, were re-dug over the weekend.  Jersey 
barriers were also repositioned to limit unauthorized access 
to the Chancery compound\'s employee parking lot and vehicle 
entrance. 
 
-------------- 
EAC Conclusion 
-------------- 
 
6.  (S/NF)  The EAC concluded that there have been no 
substantive changes in previously reported assessments of the 
local security environment since the last meeting held on 
December 29 (reftel A), and that the Embassy\'s FPCON and 
already heightened security posture remain appropriate. 
Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely aware of the need to 
monitor both the regional and local security and threat 
environments, and is prepared to take the necessary 
countermeasures should changes to either occur.  AMB, A/DCM, 
RSO, A/MGT, RMAS, P/E, CONS, MSG, DAO, OMC (USDR), and ECA 
(USCENTAF) participated in the meeting, which was preceded by 
a meeting of the Visas Viper Committee.

The Best Defense Is A Good Offense 
---------------------------------- 
 
1. The government-owned Arabic daily \"Oman\" published an 
editorial on December 30 under the title \"You Too\": 
 
\"The United States is not insisting on the death penalty as 
punishment for the crimes against humanity perpetrated by Saddam 
Hussein.  Yet Iraqi judges intend on prosecuting him to the 
fullest extent of the law on all charges brought against him. 
Despite insurmountable evidence of his crimes against the Iraqi 
people, convicting Saddam will prove to be a difficult task. 
Saddam\'s lawyers will argue that his intention was to stave off 
rebellion -- not to destroy the lives of his people.  Saddam\'s 
defense is a controversial issue being debated in the 
international arena, especially since many harbor doubts about 
the legality of America\'s invasion of Iraq.  If Saddam\'s defense 
attorneys get UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to admit the war in 
Iraq began illegally, and if Saddam\'s top advisors do not testify 
against him, the defense will likely try to clear Saddam of 
culpability by shifting the blame to his sons Udai and Qusai.\" 
 
------------------- 
Sins Of The Parents 
------------------- 
 
2. On December 31, privately owned Arabic daily \"Al-Watan\" 
carried an editorial entitled \"Holding Children Responsible\": 
 
\"Israel recently passed a law that holds Palestinian children and 
immediate family members accountable for the political actions of 
the parents, based on Israeli standards of political activism. 
The law stipulates that any aid provided to Palestinian families 
can be revoked or discontinued if the parents are found to have 
been activists against Israel.  This law, which violates basic 
human rights, further underscores Israel\'s attempts to mute the 
Palestinians by withholding basic necessities such as food and 
medicine from children.  Inhumane practices like these are 
unprecedented, and are simply mechanisms for forcing the 
Palestinians to bow to the will of the Israelis.\" 
 
----------------- 
From Bad To Worse 
----------------- 
 
3. \"Oman\" published an editorial on January 1 entitled \"Terrorist 
Events Prevail In 2004\": 
 
\"The year 2004 was characterized primarily by terrorism, 
violence, and atrocities, despite great efforts (primarily 
American) to combat these ills.  In the past year, the world 
witnessed 22 acts of terrorism, including the attack on the U.S. 
consulate in Jeddah.  Middle Eastern conflicts remain unsolved, 
and all attempts at reform were frustrated.  Joint Arab 
cooperation remains tenuous; the Arab Summit was postponed 
indefinitely.  Iraq is still beset by violence, even after the 
transition of power to the Iraqis in June.  In the Darfur region 
of Sudan, human rights violations escalated to such a degree that 
the international community forced the UN Security Council to 
intervene.  Finally, the year concluded with a giant tsunami that 
wiped out thousands across Asia.  Can things get any worse in the 
world?\"

Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi in Muscat during the 
Secretary\'s transit en route to Asia.  As reported ref B, the

Minister regretted the fact that Oman does not share the 
wealth in natural resources that other Gulf states enjoy, and 
is therefore not in a position to contribute significant 
amounts to worthy international causes (e.g., disaster 
relief, Iraq reconstruction, aid to the Palestinian 
Administration).  He pointed out, however, that Oman was 
providing some assistance in kind (primarily food and 
clothing) to both Sri Lanka and Indonesia.  The government is 
facilitating the delivery of private contributions to those 
two states through the good offices of the Sultanate\'s 
embassies in Colombo and Jakarta.  While the Embassy will 
take every opportunity to underscore the need for 
contributions to disaster relief, all indications are that 
the Sultanate will not be forthcoming with any substantial 
amount of aid.

occurred from the yards of two Embassy-leased residences the 
evening of January 4.  In a scenario not typical for Embassy 
neighborhoods, a total of five bicycles were stolen from the 
yards of the adjacent residences.  While the residences do 
meet current security standards, RSO confirmed that he will 
re-survey both in an attempt to identify areas that may have

1. (C) Summary: Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) signed a 
40-year extension to its concession agreement with the Omani 
government on December 19.  The agreement was touted in the 
local press as symbolic of Oman\'s commitment to PDO as well 
as indicative of the Sultanate\'s capability to continue oil 
production for at least four more decades.  Meanwhile, the 
Omani government continues to revise its long-term production 
projections in an apparent effort to lower expectations while 
allowing PDO to restore its reputation.  American oil 
companies remain skeptical that PDO can deliver on its 
increasingly dubious promises, despite the lofty rhetoric. 
End Summary.

2. (U) All major news outlets in Oman covered the December 19 
signing of a 40-year extension to the concession agreement 
between the government of Oman (represented by the Ministry 
of Oil and Gas) and PDO, the dominant oil firm in Oman. 
(Note: the government owns 60 percent of the shares in PDO, 
Shell owns 34 percent, Total four percent, and Partex two 
percent.  End Note.)  PDO\'s original concession agreement was 
scheduled to expire in 2012, so the signing comes a full 
eight years in advance.  Sultan Qaboos ratified the 
concession extension in a royal decree issued January 1. 
 
3. (C) For all intents and purposes, PDO is run by Shell. 
This has created significant tensions between the expatriate 
technicians and engineers and the Omani professional staff, 
according to numerous observers and contacts.  Moreover, 
Shell\'s battered reputation from an extended crisis regarding 
overestimated reserves and declining production means that 
the Omani Ministry of Oil and Gas is keeping a wary eye on 
PDO.  Throughout 2004, PDO\'s Managing Director and other 
officials made public pronouncements about containing costs, 
making critical investments to stem the production decline 
and enhance oil recovery, and embarked upon strategic 
restructuring within the company to restore public 
confidence.  While PDO officials and analysts expect 
production to bottom out in 2005, the company\'s ability to 
restore full production levels remains in question.

------------------ 
 
4. (C) While laudable for its straightforward approach, PDO 
may be playing with numbers.  A noticeable trend in PDO 
accounting is to revise production estimates and projections 
downward in an effort to lower expectations.  Early in 2004, 
published reports indicated that PDO sought to restore 
production to nearly 900,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) by 2007. 
 By the end of the year, the figures had been revised to 
indicate a target production of close to 800,000 bbl/d by 
2009.  Moreover, PDO is also toying with its short-term 
estimates.  During a recent conference for chief executives 
in Muscat, PDO\'s director of procurement and contracting 
stated that July 2004 was the first time in nearly four years 
that PDO had achieved its target production.  Econoff noticed 
on the same graphic display that July 2004 coincided with a 
dramatic decrease in projected monthly oil production, 
thereby explaining the company\'s \"recovery\" without an 
increase in actual oil output.  Such shifting baselines call 
PDO\'s methodologies into question and cast doubts over its 
ability to deliver on lofty promises. 
 
------------------------- 
Developments in the Field 
------------------------- 
 
5. (C) While PDO is by far the largest player in the Omani 
oil patch, accounting for over 90 percent of Oman\'s crude oil 
production, other companies are chomping at the bit to gain 
additional ground in Oman.  Several American firms (Hunt Oil 
and Occidental) seek to expand their operations in the 
Sultanate, and Chinese and Thai firms are becoming 
increasingly aggressive in seeking (and winning) concessions 
on the margins of Block 6 (PDO\'s crown jewel, the largest and 
most prospective block in central Oman).  Meanwhile, PDO\'s 
only attempt at opening Block 6 itself consists of bringing 
in small-to-mid size international firms on a contract basis 
to rehabilitate marginal fields.  (Note: According to an 
executive from one such American firm, PDO\'s expertise 
appears to be in drilling wells, not in managing long-term 
production. End Note.)  Oilfield equipment suppliers told 
Econoff in late December that PDO\'s production costs range 
from $9-11 per barrel -- somewhat less in northern Oman, more 
in the south with its difficult terrain and heavy, viscous 
crude.  The suppliers went on to say that PDO is earmarking 
over $6 billion for the development of the Mukhaizna 
oilfields in southern Oman, which is also the target of 
Occidental\'s expansion plans (reftel).  These high lift costs 
and massive investment plans underscore the challenge facing 
PDO. 
 
------------------------ 
Budgets and Bottom Lines 
------------------------ 
 
6. (C) In announcing the state budget for 2005, Omani 
Minister of National Economy Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki 
January 2 revealed that the government used a revenue figure 
of $23 per barrel and an estimated average daily production 
of 753,000 bbl/d in its accounting.  Both figures deviate 
significantly from the Sixth Five Year Plan endorsed by the 
government, wherein oil production was estimated at 909,000 
bbl/d at an average price of $18 per barrel.  The chairman of 
the State Council\'s Economic Committee (a close Embassy 
contact) claimed that if oil prices were to collapse to 
levels last seen as late as 1998-99 ($10-15 per barrel), the 
government could not even meet its payroll.  In light of 
recent global price increases and oil revenue windfalls, such 
a warning falls on largely deaf ears in the government.  The 
official budgeted price of oil remains conservative, but it 
is definitely trending upward along with public spending. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) This signing represents perhaps the only good news for 
Shell in Oman all year.  Given its global and local 
difficulties with overstated reserves estimates and PDO\'s 
continuing production woes, this long-term concession 
salvaged an otherwise gloomy year for the Sultanate\'s oil 
giant.  Sultan Qaboos remains loyal to Shell, but this 
sentiment reportedly does not extend universally throughout 
the government.  PDO faces an uphill climb to restore 
production and the public\'s confidence, and sooner or later 
the shifting statistical baselines won\'t be enough to stop 
the leaks.  Huge investments in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) 
technologies are expensive, and PDO\'s reluctance to allow 
full foreign partners into Block 6 could prove even more 
costly in the long run.  While PDO is holding its head high 
following the recent signing of its concession agreement 
extension, the prevailing mood in the oil sector is far from 
celebratory in Oman.

SUBJECT: OMAN ONLINE: CHATROOM CREDIBILITY, CLASS CHOICES 
 
 
1. Summary:  The Omani Internet chat room \"Sablat al-Arab\" -- or 
simply \"Al-Sablah\" -- is the liveliest and most comprehensive 
Arabic-language forum for political and social discourse in the 
country, touching on issues and personalities rarely addressed in 
the conventional media.  While not totally free, nor wholly 
reflective of Omani public opinion, Al-Sablah nevertheless offers 
a worthwhile window into the hot topics and unvarnished views of 
the day.  This edition of Oman Online contains the following 
topics: 
 
-- Call To Publish Al-Sablah Topics In Omani Newspapers 
-- Criticizing The New Educational System 
 
End summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Al-Sablah In The News 
--------------------- 
 
2. With the continued growth of Al-Sablah, including most 
recently the addition of regular contributions from two banned 
Omani journalists, there is a growing sentiment among members 
that the forum is gaining credibility and becoming a potential 
news source.  One member proposed that the forum discussions -- 
specifically those relating to politics, economics, and social 
issues -- should be published in local Omani newspapers.  Several 
contributors embraced this idea.  One member noted, \"Some of the 
newspapers already deal with the issues we discuss in the forum. 
However, the issues are dealt with superficially and are often 
poorly reported.\"  Another offered, \"Once we establish a free 
press in Oman, this kind of reporting could happen.\"  Other more 
skeptical members wrote, \"Though we support this idea, we know 
that it is virtually impossible for the government to grant 
people, especially non-journalists, the right to put forward 
their thoughts in the news media, particularly if these 
thoughts/sentiments go against the Sultan and the Majlis.\"  The 
discussion concluded with the following comment: \"The newspapers 
published in Oman do not belong to the Omanis.  We think they 
actually belong to other countries, because these newspapers do 
not discuss the needs, demands, or problems of the Omani people! 
It appears they would rather get news topics from other places in 
the world, instead of looking internally.\" 
 
------------------------ 
Change Isn\'t Always Good 
------------------------ 
 
3. Another topic that generated a large number of responses was 
the creation of a new educational system for Omani high schools, 
under which students choose certain subjects to prepare for 
higher education, rather than follow a predetermined curriculum. 
Initially introduced as a pilot program in a few select schools, 
it is now being implemented nationally.  Al-Sablah members 
criticized the new system, with one writer stating, \"This new 
system is confusing for people who were brought up through the 
old system.  This system hasn\'t been fully reviewed, and they are 
already imposing it on the students, less than a year after the 
last curriculum change.\"  Another contributor responded, \"The 
teachers and school administrators were not properly trained for 
such a sweeping change to occur so suddenly.  Now the students 
have no real resource with which to clarify any doubts or 
questions they may have about the new system.\"  One Sablah 
member, who also happened to be a student affected by the change, 
wrote, \"We do not see the benefits of the new system to students. 
How does it really help us when it comes time for us to prepare 
for entrance into higher education?\"  A respondent summed up the 
general feeling of forum members by observing, \"This system is 
even faultier than the previous one.  What is the Ministry of 
Education doing to Oman?\"

1. (U) This is an action request for AC/CB.  See para 8. 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
2. (C/NF) Oman responded to the U.S. draft CWC Host Country 
Agreement (HCA) with a number of proposed amendments.  The 
Foreign Ministry asks that the HCA be converted to letter 
format, that it delete the term \"challenge inspections\", and 
that it contain a clause wherein the USG pledges not to 
stockpile in Oman nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. 
The MFA likewise requests information on any Middle East or 
other states with whom the USG has concluded an HCA.  The 
Ministry requests a revised text reflecting its proposed 
amendments before entering into direct negotiations.  End 
summary. 
 
3. (C/NF) A/DCM met January 5 with Ambassador Talib Miran 
al-Raisi, Chief of the MFA\'s International Organizations and 
Conferences Department, to discuss the revised draft CWC Host 
Country Agreement (reftels).  Talib Miran, who had been the 
primary interlocutor on the HCA issue back in 1999 before it 
went dormant, informed that he had met with Minister 
Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi to review the 
U.S. text.  With his disarmament issues desk officer Abdullah 
al-Amri taking notes, the Ambassador proceeded to outline 
three changes the Minister requested, and raised an 
additional question. 
 
-------------------- 
Requested Amendments 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C/NF) On format, Talib Miran said that the Minister 
prefers that the agreement be executed as an exchange of 
letters rather than MOU.  He pointed out that Bin Alawi had 
made the same request in the successful Article 98 
negotiations with the USG in 2004. 
 
5. (C/NF) Regarding terminology, he said YBA objected to use 
of the term \"challenge inspection\" in the HCA.  A/DCM pointed 
out that the term comes directly from the text of the 
Chemical Weapons Convention, and that it in fact constitutes 
a fundamental principle of the verification regime.  Talib 
Miran understood perfectly the provenance of the term and had 
explained its relevance to the Minister, but said Bin Alawi 
nevertheless finds the term offensive.  Talib Miran asked if 
it might be possible to use the term \"verification 
inspection,\" for instance, or even simply \"inspection.\" 
(Note: The Minister had a similar arbitrary objection to a 
key phrase in the Article 98 negotiations that required 
exceptional efforts to overcome.  End note.) 
 
6. (C/NF) The third amendment sought by the Minister is 
addition of a clause in which the United States pledges never 
to \"stockpile chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in 
Oman\" (Talib Miran\'s terminology).  The Ambassador said Bin 
Alawi\'s reasoning behind the statement is that U.S. military 
assets are far less likely to be subject to a challenge 
inspection if there were nothing in the country that might 
attract unwanted attention. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Direct Negotiations, Extra Information 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C/NF) A/DCM inquired whether and when the Omanis would be 
willing to engage in direct negotiations with USG 
counterparts on the text (ref A, para 9B).  The Ambassador 
replied that MFA\'s preference is to receive a new text 
containing as much of the revisions requested above as 
possible.  Once provided, he would share it with the Minister 
and seek to obtain permission to enter into direct 
negotiation (were further negotiations deemed necessary). 
Along with a revised draft, Talib Miran said it would be 
helpful to provide Oman with information on which other 
states have signed HCA\'s.  A/DCM pointed out that 
confidentiality provisions were a key element in our HCA\'s, 
 
SIPDIS 
as evident in the draft text provided.  The Ambassador 
replied that any information would be better than none, even 
if it were simply a count of the existing agreements and 
indication of their geographical distribution.  Obviously, he 
said, the Minister would feel better knowing that other 
states in the Middle East have concluded HCA\'s with the U.S. 
before Oman. 
 
---------------------------- 
Consulting with the Military 
---------------------------- 
8. (C/NF) A/DCM inquired whether Ministry of Defense (MOD) 
officials had participated in the 1998-99 deliberations on 
the HCA and whether they would participate in any future 
negotiations.  Talib Miran replied that the MFA is the 
responsible authority for the CWC and, as a result, the MOD 
had not shown interest in participating.  He cited MOD\'s 
ambivalence as being a contributing factor for why the HCA 
negotiations slipped to the back burner in 1999.  A/DCM 
pointed out that any challenge inspection on Omani territory 
would almost certainly involve MOD facilities, making its 
involvement in the HCA process a key element.  Talib Miran 
replied that he would encourage MOD involvement and, at 
minimum, share all relevant information with it.  (Note: 
Implementation of any HCA would be problematic without the 
full cooperation of the Ministry of Defense.  End note.) 
 
-------------- 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
9. (C/NF) The Embassy would appreciate the Department\'s 
response to the Omani suggestions and question raised above.

1. (SBU)  Following the Ambassador\'s December 27 discussion 
with Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi 
to encourage Oman\'s bringing into force its IAEA safeguards 
agreement and approving the Additional Protocol (ref A), 
A/DCM also raised the matter in a January 5 meeting on other 
issues with MFA Chief of International Organizations 
Department, Ambassador Talib Miran al-Raisi.  Talib Miran\'s 
office is responsible for all multilateral agreements and 
conventions. 
 
2. (SBU)  Asked for a status report, Talib Miran apologized 
that he could not immediately reply as to the Additional 
Protocol, noting that he recently had a change in his 
personnel responsible for IAEA issues.  He endeavored to 
provide a later update.  The safeguards agreement, he said, 
was still under review by an interministerial committee 
before final action could be taken.  The Omani acknowledged 
that the safeguards and Additional Protocol were not high 
priorities for the Ministry given the fact that Oman had no 
current plans or future intentions to seek nuclear 
technologies.  Drawing on ref B, A/DCM emphasized that 
positive actions by all states, including Oman, were 
essential in ensuring that the enhanced measures for nuclear 
cooperation and non-proliferation become the new 
international standard.  Talib Miran was likewise informed 
that the G-8 Foreign Ministers had addressed a direct appeal 
to counterparts, and that the G-8 missions in Muscat will be 
strongly encouraging the Ministry to finalize these two 
actions. 
 
3. (SBU)  The Embassy will report any further developments,

G-8 missions (particularly UK and Japan).

Summary

1.  (SBU)  The Ambassador chaired a meeting of the core 
Emergency Action Committee January 8 to review the Embassy\'s 
security posture following the local weekend.  Members of the 
EAC noted no substantive changes in the local security 
environment since the last meeting.  Accordingly, the EAC 
agreed that the Embassy\'s already heightened security posture 
and FPCON remain appropriate.  End Summary.

Security Environment 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  On January 8, the Ambassador chaired a meeting of 
the core Emergency Action Committee (\"EAC\") to review the 
Embassy\'s security posture following the local weekend.  The 
meeting opened with a discussion of the local and regional 
security situations; the EAC continued to characterize the 
former as stable, noting no new threat reporting specific to 
Oman. 
 
3.  (SBU)  RSO did, however, raise a situation that occurred 
over the weekend in which two direct-hire employees were 
harassed by a group of young Omani males upon exiting the 
parking lot of a local movie theater in one of the employees\' 
privately owned vehicle bearing diplomatic license plates 
(ref A).  The harassment continued with three of the 
individuals following the employees in a privately registered 
vehicle, subsequently blocking their path in the parking lot 
of a hotel restaurant.  Per standing guidance, the employees 
immediately called the Marine on Post One, who instructed 
them to return to the Embassy where security guards and 
police would be standing-by for assistance.  The employees 
quickly backed out of the parking lot and proceeded to the 
Embassy; however, the vehicle which had followed them 
turned-off on approach to the Embassy, possibly aware of the 
police presence ahead.  RSO is in the process of reporting 
details of the incident, including vehicle description and 
license plate number, to the Royal Oman Police.  EAC Members 
cited no other security incidents among their staffs or 
family members over the weekend, and CONS confirmed that 
there were no security incidents or security-related queries 
from the private American citizen community. 
 
------------------- 
Sustained Vigilance 
------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Prior to concluding the meeting, RSO reiterated 
that, despite the relative calm, members of the EAC must 
continue reinforcing to both their staffs and family members 
the need for vigilance regarding all aspects of personal 
security, including the need to maintain a low profile and to 
remain unpredictable.  RSO further re-emphasized the 
importance of immediately reporting all suspicious activity 
or security-related incidents -- especially those involving 
suspected surveillance -- to Post One. 
 
-------------- 
EAC Conclusion 
-------------- 
 
5.  (S/NF)  The EAC concluded that there have been no 
substantive changes in previously reported assessments of the 
local security environment since the last meeting held on 
January 5 (reftel B), and that the Embassy\'s FPCON and 
already heightened security posture remain appropriate. 
Nonetheless, the EAC remains acutely aware of the need to 
monitor both the regional and local security and threat 
environments, and is prepared to take the necessary 
countermeasures should changes to either occur.  AMB, A/DCM, 
RSO, RMAS, P/E, CONS, A/MGT, DAO, OMC (USDR), and ECA 
(USCENTAF) participated in the meeting.

\"We should note the outstanding coverage that the Western media 
gave to the tsunami crisis.  It was more than just a headline. 
They offered 24-hour coverage of the aftermath of the tsunami. 
For days, we heard reports about the crisis and received 
information about how we could provide assistance. Coverage 
included the addresses and contact information for humanitarian 
organizations involved in helping victims of the tragedy....  On 
the other hand, coverage of the catastrophe was superficial in 
the Arab media. The Arab press sent very few correspondents to 
cover the crisis as if it had happened on another planet.  How 
can the Arab media expect to compete internationally with CNN and 
other networks if it focuses on local news, and when a huge event

\"The summit of countries neighboring Iraq that was held recently 
in Jordan was--without exaggeration--a truly significant event 
because all of Iraq\'s neighbors participated in it and because 
each of the nations expressed its strong commitment to rebuilding 
the country.  If the countries keep their word, they will rise 
above their differences to help establish a stable Iraq.  To do 
this, they must refrain from interfering in Iraq\'s internal

1. As reported in ref B, the government of Oman has offered 
to facilitate the delivery of private contributions to 
tsunami victims in the Indian Ocean region.  Since an initial 
 
SIPDIS 
shipment of 41 tons of aid, the government of Oman has 
committed to shipping over 300 tons of relief supplies.  The 
Oman Charitable Organization (OCO), a government-supervised 
charitable umbrella entity, has taken the lead in the 
collection effort on behalf of the government.  In an effort 
to raise USD 3 million worth of aid, the OCO has also set up 
special accounts for monetary donations.  To date, the OCO 
has delivered over 1,200 tons to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. 
According to the executive director of the OCO, Ali Ibrahim 
Shanoor, if the organization receives more money than 
expected, the OCO plans on constructing small houses in the 
affected countries.  According to the Oman News Agency, a 
supervisory delegation organized by the OCO is departing for 
Indonesia on January 11 to help set up relief centers in Aceh 
and Sumatra. 
 
2.  Private contributions continue to grow as both organized 
NGOs and individuals have stepped in to serve as liaisons for 
private donations.  Humanitarian Oman (an informal relief 
group in the Sultanate), The American International School of 
Muscat, and the British School of Muscat are organizing 
donation drives.  Additional collection points have been 
established at the Muscat Rugby Club and the Muscat 
Intercontinental Hotel.  To mobilize support from the large 
Indian expatriate community, the Indian Embassy and the State 
Bank of India in Muscat have issued notifications with bank 
account numbers for contributions to the Prime Minister\'s 
National Relief Fund.  The Art of Living Foundation in 
association with International Association for Human Values 
(AOL) has also organized volunteers in Oman and are 
collecting funds.

1. Summary:  The Omani Internet chat room \"Sablat al-Arab\" -- or 
simply \"Al-Sablah\" -- is the liveliest and most comprehensive 
Arabic-language forum for political and social discourse in the 
country, touching on issues and personalities rarely addressed in 
the conventional media.  While not totally free, nor wholly 
reflective of Omani public opinion, Al-Sablah nevertheless offers 
a worthwhile window into the hot topics and unvarnished views of 
the day.  This edition of Oman Online contains the following 
topic: 
 
-- A comparison between the Omani Majlis Al-Shura and the Kuwaiti 
Parliament 
 
End summary.

Which System Rules? 
------------------- 
 
2. An al-Sablah member began a discussion comparing Oman\'s Majlis 
Al-Shura with the Kuwaiti parliament by stating, \"Although a lot 
of people criticize Kuwaiti foreign policy because of its support 
for the United States, it is clear that the country\'s strong 
internal policies have positively affected the daily lives of 
Kuwaitis.\"  Another participant commented, \"Despite the fact that 
there are several American bases in Kuwaiti territory -- giving 
the impression of strong U.S. influence -- the opposite is true. 
Anyone familiar with Kuwaiti culture and society knows that 
Kuwaitis are very much in control.  Kuwaitis do everything 
possible to preserve their culture and society.  For example, 
they prohibit bars and night clubs that serve alcohol.\"  Other 
members mentioned, \"On the other hand, Oman is relatively free 
from foreign influence, yet it permits the purchase and sell of 
alcohol.\"  According to another al-Sablah participant, \"Omani 
society is less strict because it is trying to project a sense of 
openness and tolerance for Westerners. This is the reason it 
permits things that are prohibited by Islam.\" 
 
3.  The al-Sablah member who initiated the conversation ended the 
discussion by stating, \"The Omani government only allowed women 
to run for positions in the Majlis Al-Shura to please Westerners. 
It gave women the right to vote because it knows that the Majlis 
has no real power to change the country.  However, in Kuwait, the 
parliament did not approve the participation of women in 
government, nor did it extend to women the right to vote.  This 
is because the Kuwaiti parliament has real power.  Parliament 
members have the power to effect change and are free to address 
all issues of concern to the country.\"

SUBJECT: 2005 INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT FOR OMAN 
 
REF: 04 STATE 250356 
 
1. Following is the text of the 2005 Investment Climate 
Statement for the Sultanate of Oman. 
 
2. ECONOMIC OVERVIEW 
 
Oman\'s economy is based primarily on petroleum, which 
accounted for about 66.9 percent of government revenue by 
October of FY 2004.  Oman\'s proven recoverable oil 
reserves are estimated at 5.5 billion barrels. The main 
producer of oil is the government majority-owned 
Petroleum Development Oman (PDO, in partnership with 
Royal Dutch Shell), which controls 90 percent of reserves 
and the lion\'s share of total production. Oman\'s gas 
reserves stood at 30.3 trillion cubic feet (tcf) at the 
end of 2004, according to independent industry observers. 
Some analysts believe gas reserves can reach 40 tcf in 
the coming years, in light of efforts to encourage 
companies actively to explore for gas.  Oman\'s oil 
production throughout 2003 averaged 819,500 barrels per 
day (b/d), an 8.6% drop from the 2002 level of 897,400 
b/d.  By the end of October 2004, daily production 
averaged 781,400 b/d, a 5% drop compared to the same 
period of 2003.  Occidental Petroleum is the second 
largest producer in Oman, and its production is estimated 
at around 45,000 b/d. 
 
In 2003, the Omani government awarded a tender for the 
construction of a third liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
train, Qalhat LNG, to expand the existing Oman LNG plant 
in Sur.  Oman LNG began operations in April 2000 with two 
3.3 metric ton per annum (MTPA) LNG production trains for 
a total production rate of 6.6 MTPA. The expansion will 
bring the Oman\'s total production capacity to 9.9 MTPA 
and is expected to come online by 2006.  Off-take of much 
of the production from this plant has already been 
contracted to Spanish and Japanese buyers.  A September 
2004 agreement guaranteed a long-term natural gas supply 
from the government to Qalhat LNG and outlined the terms 
of an investment partnership between Oman LNG, Qalhat 
LNG, and the Spanish firm Union Fenosa.  In June 2003 
Oman LNG signed a six-year agreement with BP to supply 
twelve LNG shipments over six years, beginning in 2004. 
The Omani government is in the process of building its 
own fleet of LNG vessels to facilitate spot sales.  Two 
Korean-built vessels already operate under Omani flag to 
supply the Korean market with LNG.  In May 2003, Oman LNG 
awarded a tender to build an additional four LNG vessels, 
which are currently under construction in Japan and South 
Korea. 
 
The government encourages the private sector to take on a 
greater role in financing infrastructure projects.  The 
capital area and other population centers have modern, 
well-developed communications, utilities, and road 
systems.  Additional investment is extending this 
infrastructure to rural areas.  The long-term \"Oman 
Vision 2020\" development plan highlighted the need for 
the Omani economy to diversify beyond its present 
reliance on petroleum, through a process of Omanization, 
industrialization and privatization.  The government has 
proceeded with several major privatization projects, 
including power generation projects in Salalah, Barka, 
Rusayl, and the Sharqiya region.  In late 2001, a 
consortium led by the British Airport Authority became 
the strategic partner for Muscat\'s Seeb International 
Airport and Salalah Airport.  However, the consortium 
dissolved in November 2004 following disagreement with 
the government over delayed construction of new airport 
terminals.  Management of the airports has reverted to 
the government, and new airport expansion plans are 
underway.  The latest plan envisions a second runway and 
a new terminal with a 12 million passenger per annum 
capacity at Seeb International Airport by 2008, along 
with a new terminal capable of accommodating up to 2 
million passengers per annum in Salalah.  Other privately 
financed infrastructure projects include a petrochemical 
plant, a steel rolling mill, a fertilizer plant, and an 
aluminum smelter in Sohar. 
 
One of the most successful diversification projects thus 
far is Salalah Port, opened in 1998.  The container 
transshipment port was originally established jointly by 
private investors (40 percent), the Omani government (30 
percent), U.S. Sea-Land (15 percent), and Maersk (15 
percent); Maersk bought Sea-Land\'s share in mid-1999. 
The port handled more than 2.2 million TEUs in 2004, 
surpassing its 2004 target of two million TEUs.  Aside 
from being one of the largest in the region, Salalah Port 
ranks among the most efficient container ports in the 
world.  It is currently undergoing a major expansion 
plan, adding two new berths and extending its breakwater 
to meet sustained increases in demand. The Omani 
government formed its own company in 2004 to pursue the 
establishment of an industrial free zone at Port Salalah, 
possibly with a foreign partner. 
 
According to the 2003 national census, the number of 
expatriates in Oman is 559,000 - one-quarter of the 
population.  Despite government efforts to replace 
expatriate workers with Omanis, Oman still depends 
heavily on South Asian labor to fill jobs that require 
physical labor, clerical work, or certain technical 
skills.  According to the government\'s recently published 
Human Development Report, Oman\'s population is growing at 
an estimated 3.3% annual rate, with 45.2 percent of the 
national population younger than 20 years old and 56 
percent younger than 24 years.  (Note: this growth rate 
is considerably higher than the 1.9% annual rate reported 
in the 2003 national census.  End Note.)  More than 
45,000 Omanis graduate from secondary school each year; 
most are unable to find immediate work or continue with 
higher education. The government encourages training for 
Omanis as a means to spur employment, and the Ministry of 
Manpower increasingly uses its authority to enforce 
Omanization efforts, particularly at the lower end of the 
wage scale. 
 
Continued development and population pressures have also 
contributed to a growing water problem.  Aquifers are 
being seriously depleted.  There are increasing levels of 
salinity in groundwater in coastal agricultural areas.  A 
Middle East Desalination Research Center officially 
opened in 1997, with its headquarters in Muscat; initial 
funding for this center came from Oman, the United 
States, Japan, Israel, and Korea. 
 
Oman is developing more light manufacturing industries. 
In order to provide facilities for these efforts, the 
Public Establishment for Industrial Estates manages 
industrial estates throughout the country.  More than 235 
factories operate in industrial estates, with a total 
investment of $1.3 billion. The original and most 
developed is Rusayl Industrial Estate, located on the 
outskirts of the capital. 
 
A dramatic downturn in the Muscat Securities Market 
(MSM), which lost nearly 70 percent of its value from 
1998 to 2001, hurt many small and first-time investors 
deeply and undermined confidence in the economy.  The MSM 
dropped from an all-time high of 509 points in February 
1998 to 152 at the end of December 2001.  Observers 
attributed the sell-off to overzealous speculation, 
combined with abnormally high equity valuations, 
uninformed investors, and a lack of transparency. 
However, in 2002 and 2003, the market began to recoup 
some of its losses, ending 2003 at 272.7 - a 42% gain 
over 2002.  This momentum continued in 2004.  In April, 
the market crossed the psychological barrier of 300 
points, ending the month at 306.  The MSM re-indexed in 
May 2004, going from a triple-digit base to a four-digit 
one and reached 3,500 by early January 2005. AES Barka 
Power Company, a subsidiary of the AES Corporation of 
Virginia, recently floated $29.1 Million (35% of its paid 
up capital) for initial public writing. According to 
press reports, public writing mobilized capital equal to 
seventeen times the amount of shares offered, showing a 
strong demand in the Omani market for portfolio 
investment.  In early 2005, telecommunications giant 
Omantel is scheduled to float 30 percent of its shares, 
which will constitute another milestone IPO for the Omani 
capital market.  Dhofar Power Company in southern Oman, a 
subsidiary of New Jersey-based PSE&G, will also undergo 
an IPO in 2005. 
 
Since 1998, the government has introduced numerous 
measures to revive the market and regain investors\' 
confidence.  The government announced a $260 million 
bailout in November 2000, offering to aid \"small 
investors\" and creating a national investment fund made 
up of contributions from government pension funds and the 
State General Reserve Fund, as well as offering 
incentives for investment companies to merge. The 
government\'s regulatory agency, the Capital Market 
Authority (CMA), also took steps to improve transparency 
in the market, including the enforcement of the 
International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 and the 
establishment of new corporate governance standards. 
 
3. OPENNESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
 
Oman actively seeks private foreign investors, especially 
in the industrial, information technology, tourism, and 
higher education fields.  Investors transferring 
technology and providing employment and training for 
Omanis are particularly welcome.  Omani law relating to 
foreign investment is contained in the Foreign Business 
Investment Law of 1974, as amended.  A Commerce Ministry 
spin-off, the Omani Center for Investment Promotion and 
Export Development (OCIPED) opened in 1997 to attract 
foreign investors and smooth the path for business 
formation and private sector project development.  OCIPED 
also provides prospective foreign investors with 
information on government regulations, which are not 
always transparent - and sometimes contradictory. 
Nevertheless, despite OCIPED\'s efforts to become a \"one- 
stop shop\" for government clearances, the approval 
process for establishing a business can be tedious, 
particularly with respect to land acquisition and labor 
requirements. 
 
With Oman\'s accession to the World Trade Organization in 
October 2000, automatic approval of majority foreign 
ownership (up to 70 percent) is available.  Registration 
of these joint ventures is treated in the same manner as 
that common to all registrants.  The foreign firm must 
supply documentary evidence of its registration in its 
home country, its headquarters\' location, its capital 
holdings, and its principal activities.  If a subsidiary, 
it must demonstrate its authority to enter the joint 
venture.  Except in the petroleum sector, where 
concession agreements with the Ministry of Oil and Gas 
determine the terms of investment, new entities with 
greater than 70 percent foreign ownership are subject to 
the approval of the Minister of Commerce and Industry. 
As part of its WTO accession package, Oman is also 
expected to allow 100 percent foreign ownership in 
certain services sector, such as banking, law, 
accountancy, and information technology. 
 
In early 1999, the government amended its corporate tax 
policy and lifted the requirement that foreign-owned 
joint ventures include a publicly traded joint stock 
company listed on the MSM in order to enjoy national tax 
treatment.  In 2003, Oman extended national tax treatment 
to all registered companies regardless of percentage of 
foreign ownership, i.e. a maximum rate of 12% tax on net 
profit. Omani branches of foreign companies are treated 
as foreign companies and therefore taxed at a maximum of 
30%.  Since Omani labor and tax laws are complex, 
investors should consider engaging local counsel. 
 
New majority foreign-owned entrants are barred from most 
professional service areas, including engineering, 
architecture, law, or accountancy.  In 1996, existing 
foreign-owned professional service firms were given 
timeframes within which to obtain Omani partners (e.g., 
five years for accounting firms).  An exception exists 
for professional service firms with subspecialties of 
critical importance to Oman.  Wholly U.S.-owned service 
firms present in Oman include Ernst & Young, KPMG, and 
the law firm Curtiss, Mallett, Colt, Mosle, and Prevost. 
Under Omani commercial law, wholly foreign-owned branches 
of foreign banks are allowed to enter the market. 
 
The permitted level of foreign ownership in privatization 
projects increased to 100 percent in July 2004, based on 
a Royal Decree providing an updated privatization 
framework.  By privatization, Oman refers not only to the 
conversion of a state-owned or mixed enterprise into a 
private sector firm, but also to the establishment of any 
new firm providing a commercial service that had 
previously been provided by the state (e.g., 
electricity).  One approach to partial conversion will be 
applied to the state-run telephone company, Omantel: the 
government is planning to float 30 percent of its stake 
in the company, while retaining the remaining 70 percent. 
 
Industrial establishments with total capital of $52,000 
or more must be licensed by the Ministry of Commerce and 
Industry.  In addition, a foreign firm interested in 
establishing a company in Oman must obtain approval from 
other ministries, such as the Ministry of Regional 
Municipalities, Environment, and Water Resources. 
Foreign workers must obtain work permits and residency 
permits from the Ministry of Manpower and the Royal Oman 
Police\'s Immigration Office. 
 
Oman\'s investment incentives focus on industrial 
development and include the following: 
 
- Five year tax holiday, renewable once; 
- Low-interest loans from the Oman Development Bank (now 
available on a very limited basis, and only for small 
firms); 
- Low-interest loans from the Ministry of Commerce and 
Industry; 
- Subsidized plant facilities and utilities at industrial 
estates; 
- Feasibility studies supplied by the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry; and 
- Exemption from customs duties on equipment and raw 
materials during the first ten (10) years of a project. 
 
4. CONVERSION AND TRANSFER POLICIES 
 
Oman has no restrictions or reporting requirements on 
private capital movements into or out of the country, and 
there have been no reports of difficulty in obtaining 
foreign exchange.  The Omani Rial is pegged to the dollar 
at a rate of 0.3849 Omani Rials to the U.S. dollar. The 
Rial was devalued slightly in 1986 due to the collapse in 
oil prices, although the government did not find the 
devaluation productive.  Late in 2001, Oman began 
implementing a new law for the prevention of money 
laundering, with updated regulations on financial crimes 
being issued in July 2004. 
 
5. EXPROPRIATION AND COMPENSATION 
 
Oman\'s belief in a free market economy and desire for 
increased foreign investment and technology transfer make 
expropriation or nationalization extremely unlikely.  In 
any event, were a property to be nationalized, Article 11 
of the Basic Law of the State stipulates that the 
Government of Oman will provide prompt and fair 
compensation. 
 
6. DISPUTE SETTLEMENT 
 
Oman is a party to the International Center for the 
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  However, the 
ultimate adjudicator of business disputes within Oman is 
the Commercial Court, which was reorganized in mid-1997 
from the former Authority for Settlement of Commercial 
Disputes (ASCD).  The Commercial Court has jurisdiction 
over most tax and labor cases, and can issue orders of 
enforcement of decisions (the ASCD was limited to issuing 
orders of recognition of decisions).  The Commercial 
Court can also accept cases against governmental bodies, 
which the ASCD was unable to do.  In such cases, however, 
the Commercial Court can issue - but not enforce - 
rulings against the government.  Many practical details 
remain to be clarified. 
 
Decisions of the Commercial Court are final if the value 
of the case does not exceed U.S. $26,000.  A Court of 
Appeals exists for cases where the sum disputed is 
greater than U.S. $26,000, and a Supreme Court was 
established in mid-2001.  Decisions of the Supreme Court 
are final.  However, a case may be re-opened after a 
judgment has been issued if new documents are discovered 
or irregularities (e.g., forgery, perjury) are found. 
There is no provision for the publication of decisions. 
 
Oman also maintains other judicial bodies to adjudicate 
various disputes.  The Labor Welfare Board under the 
Ministry of Manpower hears disputes regarding severance 
pay, wages, benefits, etc.  The Real Estate Committee 
hears tenant-landlord disputes, the Police Committee 
deals with traffic matters, and the Magistrate Court 
handles misdemeanors and criminal matters.  Lastly, the 
Shari\'a Court deals with family law, such as wills, 
divorces, personal and some criminal matters.  All 
litigation and hearings must be conducted in Arabic. 
 
The Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry has an 
arbitration committee to which parties to a dispute may 
refer their case when the amounts in controversy are 
small.  Local authorities, including \"walis\" (district 
governors appointed by the central government), also 
handle minor disputes.  While Oman is a member of the GCC 
Arbitration Center, located in Bahrain, that center has 
yet to establish a track record. 
 
7. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND INCENTIVES 
 
Since Oman\'s accession to the WTO in November 2000, it 
has been subject to TRIMs obligations. 
 
Under the Industry Organization and Encouragement Law of 
1978, incentives are available to licensed industrial 
installations on the recommendation of the Industrial 
Development Committee.  \"Industrial installations\" 
include not only those for the conversion of raw 
materials and semi-finished parts into manufactured 
products, but also mechanized assembly and packaging 
operations.  Firms involved in agriculture and fishing 
may also be included. Companies must have at least 35 
percent Omani ownership to qualify for these incentives. 
This law is expected to change soon to reflect recent 
developments in foreign investment regulations. 
 
In addition, companies selling locally produced goods are 
given priority for government purchases, provided that 
the local products meet standard quality specifications 
and their prices do not exceed those of similar imported 
goods by more than 10 percent.  This incentive is 
available to Omani-owned commercial enterprises, as well 
as foreign industrial producers in joint ventures with 
local concerns.  The government offers subsidies to 
offset the cost of feasibility and other studies if the 
proposed project is considered sufficiently important to 
the national economy. 
 
Only in the most general sense of business plan 
objectives does proprietary information have to be 
provided to qualify for incentives. 
 
8. RIGHT TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP AND ESTABLISHMENT 
 
Under Oman\'s foreign capital investment law, non-Omanis 
are not allowed to conduct commercial, industrial, or 
tourism businesses or participate in any Omani company 
without a license issued by the Ministry of Commerce and 
Industry. 
 
According to Oman\'s commercial companies law, all actions 
by private entities to establish, acquire, and dispose of 
interests in business enterprises must be announced in 
the commercial register, and may be subject to the 
approval of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. 
Subject to the licensing and taxation previously noted, 
foreign and domestic entities can engage in all legal 
forms of remunerative activity.  Government entities do 
not compete with the private sector, and public policy 
favors the privatization of public utilities. 
 
9. PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS 
 
Real property rights are recognized and enforced in Oman, 
and records are well kept.  There is no contemporary 
history of arbitrary seizures of land.  Subject to 
government approval, GCC nationals may own property 
anywhere in Oman.  The government actively seeks to 
promote tourism, and a key component of the drive to 
attract investment is the ability to sell villas and 
estates in mixed tourist/residential developments slated 
for construction. A new law by the Ministry of Housing, 
Electricity and Water allowing foreign nationals to own 
real estate within government-recognized tourism 
complexes in Oman was issued in November 2004.  This law 
permits freehold ownership of residential property, 
including full rights of inheritance according to the 
laws of the owner\'s country of origin, as well as 
residency status for landowners and their immediate 
family members.  The government is finalizing the 
implementing regulations and preparing to designate the 
zones within which the law will apply.  The law does not 
apply to commercial real estate, which cannot be owned by 
non-GCC nationals. 
 
Oman has a trademark law.  Trademarks must be registered 
and noted in the Official Gazette through the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry.  Local law firms can assist 
companies with the registration of trademarks. In May 
2000, Oman revised the trademark law to be in compliance 
with TRIPS. 
 
Oman enacted a copyright protection law in 1996, but did 
not announce enforcement mechanisms until a ministerial 
decree in April 1998, which extended protection to 
foreign copyrighted literary, technical, or scientific 
works; works of the graphic and plastic arts; and sound 
and video recordings. In order to receive protection, a 
foreign-copyrighted work must be registered with the 
Omani government by depositing a copy of the work with 
the government and paying a fee.  Since January 1999, the 
government has enforced copyright protection for audio 
and videocassettes, and destroyed stocks of pirated 
cassettes seized from vendors.  The government did not 
extend protection to foreign-copyrighted software until 
late 1998, when it declared that retailers must halt the 
importation and sale of non-licensed software by July 1, 
1999.  Thereafter, the government stepped up efforts to 
curtail software piracy in Oman, including raids on 
businesses to ensure that Omani firms use no pirated 
software.  The Business Software Alliance continues to 
work with Omani officials on improving enforcement of 
anti-piracy provisions. 
 
Enforcement of the copyright protection decree by the 
Ministry of Heritage and Culture, the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry, and the Royal Oman Police has been 
effective, as once plentiful pirated video and audiotapes 
and computer software have largely disappeared from local 
vendors\' shelves.  Nonetheless, under-the-counter sales 
of unauthorized software and DVDs persist in various 
locations, and authorities continue to grapple with 
effective enforcement measures against such sales.  In 
late October 2003, 16 Omani companies signed the Business 
Software Alliance (BSA) Code of Ethics.  The Code of 
Ethics declares that the signatories would neither commit 
nor tolerate the manufacture or use or distribution of 
unlicensed software and would only supply licensed 
software to customers.  In late December 2004, a 
government raid of four unauthorized software resellers 
in coordination with BSA resulted in confiscation of 
pirated software.  According to local satellite TV 
representatives, the Ministry of Commerce is staging 
sporadic raids on unlicensed distributors of pirated 
satellite signals in response to industry complaints. 
 
In mid-2000, the government introduced new, WTO- 
consistent intellectual property laws on copyrights, 
trademarks, industrial secrets, and integrated circuits. 
Further, in October 2000 Oman issued new, WTO-consistent 
intellectual property rights legislation to protect 
patents and other intellectual property rights. 
 
Oman has joined the World Intellectual Property 
Organization (WIPO), and asked WIPO to register Oman as a 
signatory to the Paris and Berne conventions on 
intellectual property protection.  Although not yet a 
party to the WIPO Internet Treaties (i.e., the WIPO 
Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms 
Treaty), the government claims it will soon accede. 
 
10. TRANSPARENCY OF THE REGULATORY SYSTEM 
 
In 2003, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority 
(TRA) began functioning as a legal and regulatory body in 
Oman.  The TRA oversees the process of liberalization and 
privatization of the telecommunications sector, and is 
composed of four senior officials (one from the Ministry 
of National Economy, one from Omantel, one from the Royal 
Oman Police, and the Minister of Transport and 
Communications, who serves as the chairman).  In 
addition, the new privatization framework law passed in 
July 2004 provides for a new regulator for public 
utilities that are being privatized in the power and 
water sectors. 
 
The government recognizes that its regulatory environment 
can hamper investment and commercial activity.  In 
addition to the ownership and agency requirements already 
mentioned, the licensing of business activities can be 
time-consuming and complicated.  The absence of a 
particular clearance will stall the entire process.  For 
example, processing shipments in and out of the Mina 
Qaboos Port can add significantly to the amount of time 
it takes to get goods to market or inputs to a project. 
 
Oman\'s tax laws can also impede foreign investment. 
Although Oman amended its tax laws to allow national tax 
treatment for joint ventures regardless of percentage of 
foreign participation, branches of foreign companies are 
taxed at 30 percent of income.  Oman\'s labor laws, which 
require minimum quotas of Omani employees depending on 
the type of work, form another potential impediment to 
foreign investment.  The government\'s Omanization effort 
has been the subject of criticism in the Omani private 
sector, which often complains that it can harm 
productivity and restrict hiring and firing policies. 
 
Government red tape and long delays in official decision- 
making are other frequent complaints among the local 
private sector.  Because decisions often require the 
approval of multiple ministries, the government decision- 
making process can be tedious and non-transparent. 
 
The government has issued a series of regulations aimed 
at increasing transparency and disclosure in the 
financial market.  The Capital Market Authority (CMA) has 
ordered all public companies to comply with a set of 
standards for disclosure.  Under the requirements, 
holding companies must publish the accounts of their 
subsidiaries with the parent companies\' accounts. 
Companies must also fully disclose their investment 
portfolios, including details of the purchase cost and 
current market prices for investment holdings.  The new 
initiatives also require publication of these financial 
statements in the local press. At the same time, the 
Central Bank has also introduced new rules to limit the 
level of \"related party transactions\" (financial 
transactions involving families or subsidiary companies 
belonging to major shareholders or board members) in 
Oman\'s commercial banks.  The new rules will help 
increase transparency in financial transactions in local 
banks and the MSM, and will help clarify the activities 
of publicly traded companies. 
 
11. EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS AND PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT 
 
There are no restrictions in Oman on the flow of capital 
and the repatriation of profits.  Access to Oman\'s 
limited commercial credit resources is open to Omani 
firms with some foreign participation.  Joint stock 
companies with capital in excess of $5.2 million must be 
listed on the MSM.  According to the recently amended 
Commercial Companies Law, companies must have been in 
existence for at least two years before being floated for 
public trading. 
 
The Sultanate has two loan programs to promote 
investment.  The Ministry of Commerce & Industry (MOCI) 
administers a program designed to promote industrial 
investment.  Formerly interest free, the program now 
charges 4 percent interest, with generous repayment 
terms.  MOCI loans will match equity contributions in the 
Muscat capital area, or 1.25 times equity for other 
locations.  Projects with a high percentage of local 
content or employing large numbers of Omanis are given 
priority, as are tourism projects outside the capital 
area.  The Oman Development Bank also administers a loan 
program to support development of smaller loans to 
industry, agriculture, fisheries, petroleum, mining, and 
services. 
 
Foreigners may invest in the MSM, as long as this is done 
through a local broker.  Since the 1998 market downturn, 
MSM statistics show that the percentage of foreign 
investment in the MSM has remained stable at around 18 
percent. 
 
The legacy of the economic slowdown continues to impact 
the banking sector, although most banks showed a 
significant increase in profitability during 2004. 
Corporate profitability declined significantly in 1999, 
but has experienced a robust recovery in subsequent 
years.  The banking law issued in November 2000 allowed 
more efficient control over the financial sector by the 
authorities.  Furthermore, early in 2003 the Central Bank 
of Oman promulgated new rules and regulations to ensure 
proper and efficient management of the banks. The effect 
of this circular was enhanced by the implementation of a 
Code of Corporate Governance, as well as amendments to 
the Capital Market Law and the Commercial Companies Law 
which stipulated that the boards of directors of all 
jointly listed companies should appoint an internal audit 
committee, an internal auditor, and a legal advisor. 
 
Banking consolidation continued in 2004 with the 
announced merger of Bank Muscat and the National Bank of 
Oman, a move that would create a $6.5 billion 
institution.  Subject to final audits and approval by the 
shareholders of the respective companies, this merger is 
expected to become final by the end of March 2005. 
 
12. POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
 
Politically motivated violence is virtually unknown in 
Oman. Since October 2000, there have been some 
demonstrations, but these were generally orderly. 
 
13. CORRUPTION 
 
Article 53 of the Basic Law of the State, issued in 
November 1996, compelled ministers to resign their 
offices in public shareholding enterprises.  As of 1999, 
Under Secretaries (deputy ministers) were also required 
to resign from the boards of any public companies.  Most 
major contracts are awarded through a slow, rigorous, but 
generally clean tender process.  Contracts awarded 
through a ministry\'s internal tender process are subject 
to fewer controls. Although Oman is not a signatory to 
the OECD convention on combating bribery, Sultan Qaboos 
has dismissed several ministers and senior government 
officials for corruption during his reign.  Oman has not 
yet signed the UN Convention Against Corruption. 
 
14. BILATERAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS 
 
Oman and the United States signed a bilateral Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) on July 7, 2004. 
This agreement established a U.S.-Oman Trade and 
Investment Council, which met for the first time in 
Washington in September 2004.  Investment issues are 
under active discussion in follow-up meetings, especially 
in preparation for negotiating a Free Trade Agreement 
(FTA) with Oman beginning in Spring 2005.  These 
negotiations will supplant previous discussions regarding 
a Bilateral Investment Treaty, as an FTA will include an 
investment chapter. 
 
15. OPIC AND OTHER INVESTMENT INSURANCE PROGRAMS 
 
Oman is eligible for Export-Import Bank of the United 
States (EXIM) financing and insurance coverage.  In late 
2003, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) 
proposed an update to its existing 1976 bilateral 
agreement with Oman to reflect current investment 
realities.  As of January 2005, the Omani government is 
still reviewing the updated agreement. 
 
16. LABOR 
 
A new Labor Law was promulgated by Royal Decree in 2003, 
providing additional protections for workers and raising 
the minimum working age from 13 to 15.  Implementing 
regulations adopted in early 2004 clarified the role and 
scope of workers\' representation committees as outlined 
in this law.  In addition, the government is expanding 
its Omanization drive to areas outside the capital of 
Muscat, particularly in the retail, transport, and light 
manufacturing sectors. 
 
Oman relies heavily on expatriate labor, primarily from 
India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, to perform 
menial and physically taxing work as well as to fill 
managerial positions.  Omani labor law stipulates basic 
practices to safeguard workers; employers set wages for 
Omanis within guidelines delineated by the Ministry of 
Manpower.  The minimum wage for Omanis working in the 
private sector, including salary and benefits, is 120 
R.O. (about $312) per month.  Work rules must be approved 
by the Ministry and posted conspicuously in the work 
place.  The workweek is five days in the public sector 
and generally five and one-half days in the private 
sector.  The labor law and subsequent regulations also 
detail requirements for occupational safety and access to 
medical treatment.  However, non-Omanis in retail, 
personal service outlets, construction, and petroleum 
fields typically work up to seven days a week, depending 
on their contracts. 
 
\"Omanization\" - the replacement of expatriate labor by 
Omanis - is a high priority for the government.  Foreign 
nationals may not be employed as technical assistants, 
guards, light vehicle drivers, Arabic typists, 
agricultural workers, forklift or mixer operators, or 
public relations officers, unless the employer can show 
that there are no Omanis available for the position. 
Only Omanis are permitted to work as taxi drivers, 
customs expediters, and fishermen.  In 1999 and 2000, the 
government \"Omanized\" (i.e., banned expatriates from 
working in) a number of low-wage jobs, including 
vegetable and grocery shopkeepers, water tank truck 
drivers, gas cylinder truck drivers, plow operators, and 
real estate agents.  Through concerted training efforts, 
the government has also sought to increase the number of 
Omanis employed as gasoline station attendants, waiters, 
barbers, and hairdressers, while allowing expatriates to 
remain employed in such positions.  The government 
recently announced its intention to Omanize 24 more 
occupation classifications over the next four years.  The 
first phase of the plan will include 16 occupation 
classifications, mainly different varieties of 
shopkeepers and repairmen. 
 
In 1994, Oman became a member of the International Labor 
Organization (ILO). 
 
17. FOREIGN TRADE ZONES/FREE PORTS 
 
Oman has no general provisions for the temporary entry of 
goods.  In the case of auto re-exports, a company can 
import vehicles into the country for the purpose of re- 
export and have duties refunded if it re-exports the 
vehicle within six months. In 1999, the government opened 
a new free trade zone at an interior border crossing 
point with Yemen (al-Mazyounah).  Oman is currently 
planning to develop a free trade zone in Salalah, 
adjacent to the international container transshipment 
port that opened in November 1998. The government has 
also expressed its intention to establish a free zone at 
Sohar port, in conjunction with plans to expand the 
existing port and industrial zone. 
 
18. FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT STATISTICS AND MAJOR 
FOREIGN INVESTORS 
 
Systematic information on foreign direct investment is 
limited. As per Capital Market Authority statistics, 
total investment in listed Omani companies with foreign 
participation was $2.4 billion in September 2004, of 
which 8.94% was foreign investment. Foreign capital 
constituted 7.49% of capital invested in finance, 3.03% 
in manufacturing, and 8.94% in insurance and services. 
 
The largest foreign investor is Royal Dutch Shell Oil, 
which holds 34 percent of Petroleum Development Oman, the 
state oil company, and 30 percent of Oman Liquid Natural 
Gas.  Other companies, such as Occidental Petroleum, BP 
Amoco, Novus Petroleum, Hunt, and Nimr have also invested 
in the petroleum sector.  Two U.S. firms, Gorman Rupp 
(water pumps) and FMC (wellhead equipment), have entered 
into industrial joint ventures with Omani firms.  Both 
joint ventures involve modest manufacturing operations. 
Since 1999, Oman has witnessed increased foreign direct 
investment through the privatization process.  Major 
foreign investors that have entered the Omani market 
recently include PSEG Global (U.S.), AES (U.S.), and 
National Power (U.K.).  Dow Chemical of the U.S. 
announced a joint venture with Oman Oil Company and the 
Government of Oman in July 2004 to develop a large 
petrochemical plant in Sohar.
