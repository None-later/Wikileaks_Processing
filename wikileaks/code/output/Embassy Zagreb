COMMUNITIES ON JULY 8, 1991 AND IN THE REPLY OF THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE PARLIAMENT TO THE ASSEMBLIES OF THE 
REPUBLIC OF SERBIA AND THE REPUBLIC OF MONTENEGRO. 
 --  TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE OPEN AGGRESSION ON THE 
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA WHICH IS EVIDENT IN THE THREAT

INTEGRITY, IN THE KILLINGS OF ITS CITIZENS, THE 
DESTRUCTION OF ITS ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES 
AND IN OTHER CRIMES UNPRECEDENTED IN OTHER CIVILIZED 
COUNTRIES, 
 --  BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE CROATIAN NATION AND 
ALL OTHER CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA MUST

FOR THESE REASONS, THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA IS 
SUSPENDING ALL RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA 
AS LONG AS OFFICIAL SERBIA SUPPORTS SUCH A POLICY, 
AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA WILL 
MAKE THE NECESSARY DECISIONS. 
 
2.  AN UNDECLARED AND UNPROVOKED AGGRESSION HAS BEEN 
CARRIED OUT AGAINST CROATIA FOR SOME TIME NOW. 
 
IT IS A CAMOUFLAGED, UNDERHANDED AND DIRTY WAR 
IMPOSED ON CROATIA WHICH HAS SO FAR TAKEN HUNDREDS 
OF HUMAN LIVES, AND CAUSED HUGE MATERIAL 
DESTRUCTION, EVEN DESTROYED ENTIRE SUBURBS. 
 
THE YUGOSLAV PEOPLES\' ARMY IS DIRECTLY AND 
INDIRECTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE AGGRESSION AGAINST 
CROATIA ORGANIZED BY THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA WITH THE 
ASSISTANCE OF THE TERRORIST REBELLIOUS GROUPS. 
 
GROUPS OF TERRORISTS WERE RECRUITED FROM WITHIN 
SERBIAN RANKS IN CROATIA WHO ARE INDOCTRINATED WITH 
THE GREATER SERBIAN AND CHETNIK IDEOLOGY.

BASED ON THE UNTRUTHS AND HISTORICAL FABRICATIONS, 
THE MILITARISM AND GREATER SERBIAN HEGEMONY, THE 
PRESENT CONDUCT OF THE STATE BODIES OF THE REPUBLIC 
OF SERBIA CANNOT REPRESENT A BASIS FOR THE 
CONSTRUCTIVE, PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE YUGOSLAV 
CRISIS. 
- 
3.  FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE POSTWAR BOLSHEVIK 
YUGOSLAVIA, THE YUGOSLAV PEOPLES\' ARMY WAS A 
CONTINUOUS IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT OF THE POLITICIAL 
AUTHORITIES, AND TODAY IT IS A PART OF THE COMMUNIST 
MILITARY COMMAND, RESISTING THE INEVITABLE 
DEMOCRATIC REFORM OF SOCIETY, ESCAPING EVERY CONTROL 
AND THREATENING THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED 
AUTHORITIES IN THE REPUBLICS. 
 
A PART OF THE ARMY IS DIRECTLY SIDING WITH THE 
TERRORISTS. 
 
4.  THESE DAYS THE AGGRESSIVE ATTACKS ON CROAITAN 
TERRITIORIES CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION OF ENTIRE 
SUBURBS AND THE EXODUS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES FROM 
THEIR HOMES, IN KEEPING WITH THE TERRORISTS\' 
GENOCIDAL PLANS FOR THE CREATION OF ETHNICALLY PURE 
SERBIAN TERRITIORIES ON THE TERRITORY OF THE 
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA. 
 
THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ON BEHALF 
OF ALL THE CITIZENS WHO HAVE RECEIVED ASSISTANCE IS 
PUBLICLY THANKING THOSE INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES,

5.  THE PARLIAMENT REQUESTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF 
THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION FOR 
THE NECESSARY MOBILIZATION OF ALL DEFENSE FORCES. 
 
COMPANIES, HEALTH, SOCIAL AND OTHER SERVICES SHOULD 
IMMEDIATELY ADAPT THEIR STRUCTURES, STAFF AND 
ACTIVITIES FOR SPECIAL DEFENSE CONDITIONS AND FOR 
THE REAL NEEDS OF THE POPULATION, SUBORDINATING 
EVERYTHING TO THE DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE 
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF THE REPUBLIC. 
 
ALL STATE SERVICES AND THE ENTIRE NATION SHOULD 
ADAPT THEIR ACTIVITIES TO THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH 
THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA FINDS ITSELF. 
- 
6.  IN THE SITUATION WHEN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA IS 
EXPOSED TO OPEN AGGRESSION ON ITS TERRITORY, THE 
MOST IMPORTANT TASK OF ALL ITS CITIZENS INCLUDING 
ALL STATE AND POLITICAL STRUCTURES AS WELL AS 
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE PARLIAMENT IS THE DEFENSE OF 
THE HOMELAND ACCORDING TO THEIR STATUS AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES.

7.  THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 
CONSIDERS THAT THE MEDIA IN THE REPUBLIC SHOULD BE 
MORE EFFICIENT IN CARRYING OUT THEIR DUTIES OF 
INFORMING TRUTHFULLY AND OBJECTIVELY THE DOMESTIC 
AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLICS ABOUT EVENTS IN CROATIA. 
 
8.  THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA IS 
EXPRESSING ITS GRATITUDE TO ALL CROATS OUTSIDE OF 
THE HOMELAND FOR THEIR PAST AND FUTURE SUPPORT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CROATIA IN ITS EFFORTS FOR DEFENSE AND 
DEVELOPMENT. 
 
9.  THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA IS

CROATIA WHICH IS CONSTITUTIONALLY ESTABLISHED AS A 
DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL STATE BASED ON LAW. 
 
IN REGARD TO THIS, THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
CROATIA ENDORSES THE LETTER WHICH THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE PARLIAMENT SENT TO THE PARLIAMENTS OF EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
10. THE YUGOSLAV PEOPLES\' ARMY HAS NOT WITHDRAWN TO 
ITS BASES AND IS THUS FLAGRANTLY VIOLATING THE

FOR THE REASONS BROUGHT FORTH, THE CITIZENS OF THE 
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA CONSIDER THE YUGOSLAV PEOPLES\' 
ARMY AS AN OCCUPYING FORCE. 
 
CONSEQUENTLY, THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
CROATIA, AS THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF ITS CITIZENS, 
DEMANDS THAT THE YUGOSLAV PEOPLES\' ARMY WITHOUT 
DELAY RETREAT TO ITS BASES AND THAT, IN ADEQUATE 
TIME, IT RETREAT FROM THE TERRITORY OF THE REPUBLIC 
OF CROATIA DURING THE PROCESS OF DISASSOCIATION. 
 
THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA EXPECTS 
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA WILL TAKE 
NECESSARY STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THIS PARLIAMENTARY 
RESOLUTION.

12. THE MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENCY FROM MONTENEGRO, 
BRANKO KOSTIC, THROUGH HIS ACTIVITIES SO FAR, AND 
ESPECIALLY HAVING PUBLICLY SUPPORTED GREATER SERBIAN

VIOLENCE TOWARDS THE LEGAL ORGANS OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
CROATIA, HAS DISCREDITED HIMSELF FROM CARRYING OUT 
ANY ACTIVITY WHATSOEVER IN THE ORGANS OF THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT OF THE SFRJ THAT IS RELATED TO THE 
PRESENT CONDITIONS IN CROATIA. 
 
13. THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 
ACCEPTS THE DECISION OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE SFRJ 
OF AUGUST 3, 1991 ABOUT AN URGENT AND ABSOLUTE 
CEASE-FIRE IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND CONSIDERS 
NECESSARY EVERY INITIATIVE AND EVERY EFFORT, 
ESPECIALLY FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, THAT AN 
IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE BE IMPLEMENTED IN CROATIA. 
CONSEQUENTLY, THE MISSION OF THE EUROPEAN OBSERVERS 
IS INEVITABLE AND WELCOME AS WELL AS ALL OTHER FORM 
OF DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF EUROPE IN THE RESOLUTION 
OF THE CRISIS.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE PARLIAMENT 
FIRMLY DECIDED, BECAUSE OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED 
REASONS, TO PROTEST AGAINST THE APPOINTMENT OF

THE COMMISSION TO MONITOR THE CEASE-FIRE.

CONTAINING MOST VALUABLE MONUMENTS OF THE CROATIAN AND 
WORLD CULTURAL HERITAGE HAS NOW COME UNDER HEAVIEST 
ATTACKS, WHILE THERE IS ALREADY STREET FIGHTING IN ITS 
IMMEDIATE VICINITY. 
 
SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE TOWN OF VUKOVAR THAT HAS BEEN 
UNDER SIEGE SINCE SEPTEMBER IS SUBJECT TO FEROCIOUS 
ATTACKS.  ITS REMAINING 15,000 INHABITANTS LIVE IN 
CELLARS UNDER RUINS, WITHOUT WATER, ELECTRICITY AND 
THE BASIC NECESSITIES, WHILE THEIR VERY LIVES ARE 
UNDER CONSTANT THREAT.  AS WAS DECLARED IN THE 
STATEMENT BY THE HEADS OF STATES AND GOVERNMENTS AT 
THE NATO COUNCIL IN ROME, ON NOVEMBER 8, THE 
CONTINUING ATTACKS ON DUBROVNIK AND OTHER CROATIAN 
TOWNS ARE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION. 
 
WE WANT TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD PUBLIC TO 
THE FACT THAT ASIDE FROM THE YUGOSLAV FEDERAL ARMY 
THERE ARE ALSO UNITS MADE UP OF SERBIAN AND 
MONTENEGRIN RESERVISTS TAKING PART IN THESE BRUTAL 
ATTACKS. 
 
THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFICIENT AND RAPID INTERVENTION OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WE WERE CALLING FOR SINCE 
THE BEGINNING OF THE AGGRESSION AGAINST CROATIA, MADE 
POSSIBLE THE COMMITMENT OF NUMEROUS WAR CRIMES AGAINST 
UNARMED CIVILIANS, UNPROTECTED URBAN CENTRES AND 
CULTURAL MONUMENTS OF NATIONAL AND WORLDWIDE 
SIGNIFICANCE BY THE YUGOSLAV ARMY.  DESTRUCTION ON 
THIS SCALE HAS NO PRECEDENT IN OUR MODERN HISTORY. 
WE ARE APPEALING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO

AND PLAN TO RETURN NOVEMBER 7), THE FIFTH MILITARY 
DISTRICT OF THE JNA, AND CROATIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS

--  REPORT ON EC MONITORING MISSION TEAM NOVEMBER 6 
VISIT TO GRUBISNO POLJE AREA 
 
2.   BEGIN TEXT.  ON 6 NOVEMBER, AN EC MONITORING 
TEAM VISITED THE GRUBISNO POLJE AREA TO INVESTIGATE 
A REPORT BY THE PRESIDENCY OF THE SFR YUGOSLAVIA

(LETTER DATED 4 NOV) THAT FORCES OF THE CROATIAN 
NATIONAL GUARD (CNG) HAD BURNT OR DESTROYED SERBIAN 
VILLAGES IN THE AREA AND KILLED THOSE INHABITANTS 
WHO WERE UNABLE TO ESCAPE. 
 
3.  THE TEAM WERE ESCORTED BY THE PERSONNEL FROM THE 
CNG.  AS SERBIAN IRREGULARS AND UNITS OF THE 
YUGOSLAV PEOPLES ARMY (YPA) REMAINED OPERATIONAL IN 
THE AREA, THERE WERE SOME VILLAGES WHICH THE TEAM 
WERE UNABLE TO VISIT FOR SAFETY REASONS. 
 
4.  THE TEAM INTERVIEWED THE COMMANDER OF THE LOCAL 
CNG FORCES IN GRUBISNO POLJE WHO SAID THAT CROATIAN 
FORCES HAD \"LIBERATED\" THE IMMEDIATE AREA IN TWO 
DAYS OF FIGHTING FROM 31 OCT TO 1 NOV; THIS HAD 
FOLLOWED A PERIOD OF 2-3 MONTHS OCCUPATION IN WHICH, 
IT WAS CLAIMED, A NUMBER OF LOCAL CZECHS AND 
CROATIANS HAD BEEN KILLED (16 IN THE VILLAGES 
SUBSEQUENTLY VISITED), HOUSES BURNT AND OTHER LOCAL 
INHABITANTS TERRORISED. THIS WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN 
DONE BY SERBIAN IRREGULARS (CHETNIKS) MADE UP FROM 
AMONG THE LOCAL SERBIAN VILLAGERS.  WITH THE ADVANCE 
OF THE CNG FORCES, THE SERBIAN FORCES, SUPPORTED BY 
YPA UNITS, HAD WITHDRAWN TOGETHER WITH MOST OF THE 
LOCAL SERBIAN POPULACE FROM THE VILLAGES CONCERNED. 
THE TEAM, STILL WITH CNG ESCORT FOR SAFETY, 
SUBSEQUENTLY VISITED THE VILLAGES OF VELIKA 
PERATOVICA, D RASENICA AND IVANOVO SELO; THEY ALSO 
PASSED THROUGH PARTS OF THE VILLAGES OF MALA 
PERATOVICA AND POLJANI AND THROUGH SERBIAN AREAS OF 
GRUBISNO POLJE.  THERE WAS CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF

VILLAGERS.  ONLY ONE SERBIAN COUPLE WAS FOUND DURING 
THE VISITS BUT THEY CONFIRMED CNG CLAIMS THAT THERE 
HAD BEEN NO CNG MALTREATMENT OF THOSE SERBIANS WHO 
HAD REMAINED IN THEIR VILLAGES.  THIS WAS ALSO 
CONFIRMED BY THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CZECHS TO WHOM 
THE TEAM TALKED.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC 
DESTRUCTION OF SERBIAN HOMES THOUGH A NUMBER OF 
HOUSES, INCLUDING THOSE OF LOCAL SERBS, HAD BEEN 
DAMAGED IN THE CONFLICT.  SOME OF THE DAMAGE TO 
SERBIAN HOMES WAS SEVERE REFLECTING THE CNG USE OF 
ARTILLERY.  THERE WAS ALSO EVIDENCE OF MORE RECENT 
BURNING OF A SMALL NUMBER OF SERBIAN HOUSES, FARM 
BUILDINGS AND HAY STACKS.  THE TEAM WAS UNABLE TO 
ESTABLISH FROM THOSE INTERVIEWED WHETHER THIS WAS DUE

RETROSPECTIVE SERBIAN SCORCHED EARTH POLICY. 
 
5.  IN CONCLUSION, WHILE THERE WAS COMPELLING 
EVIDENCE OF CHETNIK EXCESSES DURING THEIR 2-3 MONTHS 
PERIOD OF CONTROL OF THE AREA, THE TEAM COULD FIND NO 
EVIDENCE OF SUBSEQUENT CROATIAN KILLINGS OR OF A 
SYSTEMATIC POLICY OF DESTRUCTION OF SERBIAN PROPERTY 
ON THE PART OF THE CNG OR LOCAL CROAT OR OTHER 
MINORITY GROUPS.  A SECOND VISIT WILL BE MADE BY AN 
EC MONITORING TEAM ON 7 NOV TO INVESTIGATE THE 
POSITION IN OTHER VILLAGES REFERRED TO IN THE LETTER 
FROM THE PRESIDENCY OF SFR YUGOSLAVIA.  END TEXT.

SUBJECT:  ZAGREB UPDATE, NOVEMBER 25, 1991 
          - 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  PRESIDENT TUDJMAN WENT ON 
CROATIAN TELEVISION YESTERDAY TO DENOUNCE 
ALLEGED RIGHTIST AND JNA COVERT PLOTS TO BRING 
DOWN HIS GOVERNMENT.  THE EVACUATION OF JNA 
INSTALLATIONS IN THE ZAGREB AREA HAS BEGUN, 
THOUGH NOT ALTOGETHER SMOOTHLY.  SHELLING IN 
 
OSIJEK WAS REPORTED TODAY.  A CONTACT IN 
DUBROVNIK CLAIMS THE JNA AIMS TO PRESSURE THE 
CIVILIAN POPULATION OUT IN ORDER TO TAKE THE 
CITY.  REFUGEES CONTINUE TO FLOOD INTO ZAGREB 
AND ELSEWHERE, AND STORIES OF HUMANITARIAN 
ABUSES ARE MOUNTING.  END SUMMARY 
- 
TUDJMAN:  \"THE FINAL PHASE\" OF THE BATTLE 
----------------------------------------- 
2.  (U)  CROATIAN PRESIDENT TUDJMAN APPEARED ON 
CROATIAN TELEVISION SUNDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 24, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01658  01 OF 05  251748Z 
TO DECLARE THAT \"THE BATTLE\" FOR CROATIAN 
INDEPENDENCE AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION \"HAS 
TAKEN ON DRAMATIC PROPORTIONS AS IT ENTERS ITS 
FINAL PHASE.\"  TUDJMAN DISCUSSED HIS HOPES FOR A 
U.N. PEACE-KEEPING FORCE, SAYING THAT 
DIFFERENCES STILL EXISTED ON DEFINING THE 
\"CRISIS AREAS\" TO WHICH SUCH A FORCE WOULD BE 
DEPLOYED, AND WARNING THAT THE JNA AND SERBIA 
WOULD SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR TERRORITORIAL 
GAINS BEFORE THE PEACE-KEEPING FORCE COULD 
ARRIVE.  HE ASSERTED THAT WITH THE WEST NOW 
READY \"TO ACT MORE DECISIVELY, THE SERBIAN SIDE 
HAS UNDERTAKEN NEW DECEITS.\" 
- 
3.  (U)  TUDJMAN DEVOTED MUCH OF HIS SPEECH TO A 
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HE TERMED \"EVIDENT PROOF\" 
THAT BOTH CROATIAN RIGHTIST EXTREMISTS, IN THE 
FORM OF THE CROATIAN PARTY OF THE RIGHT (HDS) 
AND ITS ARRESTED LEADER, DOBROSLAV PARAGA, AND 
THE INTELLIGENCE BRANCH OF THE YUGOSLAV ARMY 
(KOS) WERE ENGAGED IN PLOTS TO OVERTHROW THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH TUDJMAN SEEMED TO 
SUGGEST THAT PARAGA WAS BEING UNWITTINGLY USED 
BY KOS RATHER THAN BEING IN ACTIVE COLLUSION 
WITH IT.  TUDJMAN CRITICIZED PARAGA AND HIS 
PARTY FOR REVIVING FASCIST SYMBOLS WHICH 
DISCREDITED CROATIA. 
- 
4.  (C)  TUDJMAN\'S EXPLANATION OF HIS \"EVIDENT 
PROOF\" WAS NOT VERY SPECIFIC, AND WHEN WE RAISED 
THE ISSUE THE FOLLOWING DAY DURING A MEETING

DEFECTED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO FROM THE JNA TO JOIN 
THE CROATIAN SIDE.)  MOREOVER, THERE WAS 
EVIDENCE THAT DEDAKOVIC WAS COOPERATING WITH 
PARAGA IN A PLOT TO OVERTHROW TUDJMAN AND HIS 
GOVERNMENT, SARINIC CLAIMED.

PARAGA REMAINS JAILED 
--------------------- 
5.  (U)    PARAGA\'S DETENTION HAS BEEN EXTENDED 
THIRTY DAYS PENDING PREPARATION OF THE CASE 
AGAINST HIM.  PARAGA\'S DEPUTY, MILAN VUKOVIC, 
WAS RELEASED OVER THE WEEKEND, AND IMMEDIATELY 
ANNOUNCED THAT HE, ALONG WITH PARAGA, WOULD 
CONTINUE A HUNGER STRIKE UNTIL PARAGA\'S 
RELEASE. 
 
6.  (C)  VIRTUALLY ALL OF CROATIA\'S OPPOSITION

PARAGA SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BY POLITICAL RATHER

IN AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT ARE TAKING THIS STANCE 
OF OPPOSITION SOLIDARITY WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, 
HOWEVER; AS ONE JOURNALIST POINTED OUT, MANY IN 
THE OPPOSITION WERE CRITICIZING TUDJMAN ONLY 
LAST WEEK FOR NOT DEALING MORE FORCEFULLY WITH 
PARAGA. 
- 
7.  (C)  THERE HAVE BEEN DAILY GATHERINGS SINCE 
SATURDAY OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED PERSONS, INCLUDING 
SOME OF PARAGA\'S ARMED TROOPS, IN ZAGREB\'S MAIN 
SQUARE TO PROTEST PARAGA\'S ARREST.  THESE 
PROTESTS ARE REPORTEDLY SLATED TO OCCUR DAILY 
UNTIL HIS RELEASE.  TUDJMAN AIDE SARINIC CLAIMED 
TO US THAT \"THE MAJORITY\" OF THE FORCES LOYAL TO 
PARAGA (HE PUT THEM AT \"LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND\") 
ARE ACCEPTING INTEGRATION INTO REGULAR CROATIAN 
FORCES.  MOST OTHER CROATIAN SOURCES CONSIDER 
THIS PREDICTION UNREALISTICALLY OPTIMISTIC.

NOVEMBER 22 TO EVACUATE THE REMAINING BLOCKED 
JNA \"PEACE-TIME UNITS\" IN CROATIA BEGAN OVER THE 
WEEKEND.  CONVOYS LEFT PLESO, NEAR THE ZAGREB 
AIRPORT, HEADED FOR BANJA LUKA UNDER EC 
SUPERVISION.  THE EC MONITORS SPOKESMAN TOLD US 
THAT THE CONVOY WAS FIRED UPON FROM CROATIAN

INAUSPICIOUS START FOR LATEST CEASE-FIRE 
---------------------------------------- 
9.  (C)  ACCORDING TO EC MONITORS, HEAVY JNA 
SHELLING OCCURRED OVER THE WEEKEND IN KARLOVAC, 
ZADAR, AND OSIJEK, AND DID NOT STOP ENTIRELY 
WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW CEASE-FIRE 
EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 22 AT 1800 LT.  THE EC 
SPOKESMAN SAID CROATIAN FORCES DEMOLISHED THE 
MASLENICA BRIDGE (25 KM NORTHEAST OF ZADAR) THE 
NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 20-21, RESULTING IN SOME 
THIRTY DEATHS. 
 
10.  (C)  DURING OUR CALL ON SARINIC AT THE 
PRESIDENCY MONDAY MORNING, SARINIC RECEIVED WORD 
THAT THE JNA WAS SHELLING OSIJEK.  SARINIC 
CALLED DEFENSE MINISTER KADIJEVIC\'S OFFICE TO 
PROTEST THE APPARENT CEASE-FIRE VIOLATION, AND 
LATER TOLD US IN DISGUST THAT THE JNA CLAIMED 
THE CROATIANS THEMSELVES WERE SHELLING OSIJEK.

11.  (C)  SLOBODAN LANG, PRESIDENT OF THE 
CROATIAN-AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY AND A 
LONG-TIME CONSULATE CONTACT, HAS BEEN 
TELEPHONING US NIGHTLY FROM THE DUBROVNIK AREA 
WITH UPDATES.  (HE APPARENTLY HAS ACCESS TO 
COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES BROUGHT IN BY ONE OF 
THE RELIEF GROUPS.)  LANG SAYS THE JNA IS 
ATTEMPTING TO INTIMIDATE THE CIVILIAN POPULATION 
TO ABANDON DUBROVNIK BY USING A COMBINATION OF 
THREATS (LANG SAID YET ANOTHER JNA \"ULTIMATUM\" 
EXPIRED AT 1100 THIS MORNING), SHELLING, AND 
SPORADIC ADMISSION OF RELIEF VESSELS TO TAKE 
PEOPLE OUT.  THE AIM, ACCORDING TO LANG, IS TO 
REDUCE THE POPULATION TO WHAT CAN BE CLAIMED TO 
BE \"USTASI HOLD-OUTS\" AND THEN TO TAKE THE CITY. 
- 
12.  (C)  LANG SAID HE IS CONCENTRATING HIS 
EFFORTS ON PRACTICAL MEASURES AIMED AT WINNING 
JNA OBSERVANCE OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN 
CONVENTIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE JNA IS BEING 
ASKED TO ALLOW LOCAL WOMEN RESIDENTS TO 
ACCOMPANY THEM WHEN THEY ENTER HOMES TO SEARCH 
FOR WEAPONS IN AN EFFORT TO MONITOR THEIR 
BEHAVIOR.  SOME TROOPS ARE DISCIPLINED, HE SAID; 
OTHERS, NOTABLY THE RESERVISTS, \"HAVE NEVER 
HEARD OF THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS AND DON\'T 
CARE.\"  BASED ON HIS DEALINGS THERE, LANG 
BELIEVES THAT SOME POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR 
OBTAINING COOPERATION FROM MONTENEGRO TO ASSURE 
THE SECURITY OF DUBROVNIK.

14.  (U)  REFUGEES FROM VUKOVAR AND ELSEWHERE 
CONTINUED TO POUR INTO ZAGREB OVER THE WEEKEND. 
WE ARE NOW HEARING FIGURES OF 100,000 REFUGEES 
IN ZAGREB ITSELF (THOUGH MOST OF THESE WILL 
QUICKLY BE MOVED ELSEWHERE) AND AS MANY AS HALF 
A MILLION IN CROATIA AS A WHOLE.  THE REFUGEES 
FROM VUKOVAR TELL WRENCHING STORIES OF MONTHS 
SPENT IN UNDERGROUND SHELTERS, WITH DIMINISHING 
SUPPLIES, NO NEWS OF THEIR FAMILIES, AND FINALLY 
OF EMERGING TO FIND THEIR CITY COMPLETELY 
DEMOLISHED AROUND THEM.

UNCOVERED HAVE RAISED PUBLIC EMOTION ABOUT THE 
WAR TO A HIGH PITCH.  CROATIAN ANGER WAS FURTHER 
STOKED BY THE BBC BROADCAST OF FOOTAGE FROM 
VUKOVAR OF SERBIAN IRREGULARS MARCHING 
VICTORIOUSLY THROUGH THE STREETS SINGING 
(UNBEKNOWNST TO THE BRITISH CORRESPONDENT) AN 
OLD \"CHETNIK\" SONG OF WHICH THE WORDS WERE 
CLEARLY HEARD:  \"THERE\'LL BE MEAT; THERE\'LL BE 
MEAT; WE\'LL SLAUGHTER CROATS.\"  THE JNA 
ALLEGATION THAT CROATS HAD MASSACRED SERBIAN 
CHILDREN IN VUKOVAR, PUBLISHED BY REUTERS AND 
LATER RETRACTED, IS BEING CITED AS FURTHER PROOF 
OF SERBIAN PERFIDY. 
- 
16.  (U)  AT THE SAME TIME, THE CROATIAN PRESS 
HAS REPORTED AN ALLEGED MASSACRE BY SERBIAN 
IRREGULARS OF 35 CIVILIANS FROM THE CROATIAN 
VILLAGE OF SKABRNJA, NEAR ZADAR.  ACCORDING TO 
PRESS REPORTS, THE BODIES WERE TURNED OVER BY 
THE JNA TO THE ZADAR MEDICAL CENTER, WHICH 
ESTABLISHED THAT THE BODIES BORE SIGNS OF 
\"MASSACRE.\"  THE EC MONITORS\' SPOKESMAN TOLD US 
TODAY THAT THE EC GROUP REGARDS THE CASE AS A 
\"SERIOUS ONE MERITING INVESTIGATION,\" BUT THAT 
THE JNA HAS DENIED PERMISSION TO EC MONITORS TO 
VISIT THE AREA.

MONITORS\' GROUP THAT EFFORTS TO CONFIRM THE

1.  SUMMARY:  ACCORDING TO CROATIAN PRESS 
REPORTS AND THE EC MONITORING MISSION IN ZAGREB, 
THE UNBLOCKING OF JNA INSTALLATIONS AROUND 
ZAGREB IS PROCEEDING, BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS 
THAT COULD SPIKE THE EVACUATION AT ANY TIME. 
 
THE EC MONITORS CONTINUE TO SEEK JNA PERMISSION 
TO VISIT VUKOVAR HOSPITAL DIRECTOR BOSANAC, 
WHOSE ARREST THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS 
PROTESTED.  THE EC MONITORS HAVE PROVIDED US IN 
CONFIDENCE LENGTHY REPORTS OF VIOLATIONS OF THE 
SECOND PROTOCOL TO THE GENEVA CONVENTION BY THE 
JNA.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  EC MONITORS\' SPOKESMAN RENILDE STEEGHS TOLD 
US THAT FOUR CONVOYS WERE SCHEDULED TO DEPART 
TODAY FROM FOUR DIFFERENT INSTALLATIONS, 
INCLUDING ONE FROM THE MARSHALL TITO BARRACKS IN 
ZAGREB.  STEEGHS NOTED THAT THE JNA WAS NOT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

ABIDING BY ITS AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE THE EC 
MONITORS WITH 48 HOURS NOTICE OF WHICH CONVOYS 
IT INTENDED TO ORGANIZE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR 
THE MISSION TO PLACE ITS MONITORING TEAMS. 
ALTHOUGH THE MONITORS CONSIDERED THIS A 
VIOLATION OF THE AGREEMENT ON UNBLOCKING, THEY 
HAVE DECIDED FOR NOW, ABSENT CROATIAN PROTEST, 
NOT TO PROTEST THE ISSUE TO THE JNA. 
- 
3.  STEEGHS, WHOSE COMMENTS GENERALLY TRACK 
CLOSELY WITH THE VIEWS OF EC CHIEF OF MISSION 
VAN HOUTEN NOTED THAT SOME JNA ACTIONS SEEMED 
NEEDLESSLY PROVOCATIVE; FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAD 
SENT, WITHOUT NOTICE, A CONVOY OF CROATIAN 
VEHICLES WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED IN SLUNJ AND 
HASTILY REPAINTED TO AN INSTALLATION IN ZAGREB 
FOR THE EVACUATION.  THE CROATIANS HAD SEARCHED 
THE VEHICLES AND FOUND WEAPONS, SLOWING DOWN THE 
EVACUATION PROCESS.  THE JNA WAS ALSO INSISTING 
ON FLYING LARGE YUGOSLAV FLAGS ON CONVOY 
VEHICLES AS THEY DROVE THROUGH CROATIA. 
- 
4.  AT MIDDAY TODAY STEEGHS REPORTED THAT 
PROBLEMS HAD DEVELOPED IN KARLOVAC, THROUGH 
WHICH THE CONVEYS ARE PASSING.  MINES PREVIOUSLY 
PLACED BY THE CROATS HAD STOPPED THE CONVOYS. 
THE CROATS WERE SAYING THEY LACKED THE NECESSARY 
EXPERTISE TO REMOVE THE MINES AND THAT THEY WERE 
BEING FIRED UPON BY JNA SNIPERS WHEN THEY 
TRIED.  (STEEGHS SAID THE CROATIAN CLAIM OF LACK 
OF KNOWLEDGE RINGS TRUE; IN PULA, WHICH HAS

I AM ADDRESSING YOU ON BEHALF OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
CROATIA, CURRENTLY THE YOUNGEST EUROPEAN STATE, BUT 
A STATE WITH A CENTURIES-LONG TRADITION OF 
STATEHOOD.  CROATIA NOW SEEKS THE RECOGNITION OF HER

CROATIAN JEWISH COMMUNITY, WHOSE CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
CULTURAL, PUBLIC, ECONOMIC AND SPIRITUAL LIFE OF 
CROATIA HAS BEEN INVALUABLE, SUFFERED TRAGIC LOSSES 
DURING THE WAR.  ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

THESE CRIMES, IT IRREVOCABLY JOINED ITS PATRONS, 
SHARING THEIR HISTORICAL FATE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, A 
VAST NUMBER OF CROATS - MYSELF AMONG THEM - TOOK UP 
ARMS AGAINST THE USTASHA REIGN OF TERROR AND THE 
NAZI AND FASCIST OCCUPATION. 
 
WE DEEPLY REGRET THE FACT THAT THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN 
CROATIA SUFFERED THE TRAGIC FATE OF THE HOLOCAUST 
DURING THE WORLD WAR II.  HOWEVER, DURING THIS GRAVE 
ORDEAL, THE CROATIAN PEOPLE SHOWED SOLIDARITY WITH 
THE VICTIMS OF THE USTASHA REGIME.  THIS IS 
INDISPUTABLY EVINCED BY EXAMPLES OF DIRECT 
ASSISTANCE WHICH THE POPULATION AND THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH IN CROATIAN RENDERED TO THE JEWS IN CROATIA. 
A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE 
PERSECUTED JEWS WAS THE ACTION OF THE SCHOOL YOUTH 
OF ZAGREB.  BROUGHT TOGETHER AT THE STADIUM WHERE 
YOUNG JEWS WERE TO BE SINGLED OUT, ALL THEIR 
CROATIAN FELLOW STUDENTS STEPPED OUT TO JOIN THEM.

THIS IS ONE OF NUMEROUS CASES INDICATING THAT 
ANTI-SEMITISM DURING THE USTASHA REGIME WAS THE 
PRODUCT OF HITLER\'S NEW EUROPEAN ORDER. 
 
AS AN HISTORIAN, I HAVE DEVOTED MANY PAGES OF MY 
BOOKS TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE HORRORS OF VIOLENCE 
SUFFERED BY THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN RECENT HISTORY.  TO 
MY GREAT REGRET, PARTS OF MY BOOK \"WASTELANDS OF 
HISTORICAL REALITY\" HAVE BEEN MISINTERPRETED EITHER 
AS HISTORICAL REVISIONISM OR AS ANTI-SEMITISM.  AS A 
FORMER ANTI-FASCIST FIGHTER AND A COMMITTED 
DEMOCRAT, I REFUTE ALL INTENTIONS OF THE KIND. 
 
THE OBJECTIVITY OF MY CONVICTION IS CONFIRMED TODAY 
BY RELATIONS BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC CROATIA WITH THE 
JEWISH COMMUNITY, BY THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE JEWISH 
COMMUNITY TO THE CREATION OF A NEW DEMOCRATIC AND 
INDEPENDENT REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, AS WELL AS BY ITS 
PARTICIPATION IN THE MANY EFFORTS INTENDED TO EASE

SUCH DISTINGUISHED JEWISH INTELLECTUALS AS ALAIN 
FINKIELKRUT AND ANDRE GLUSKSMAN, REGARDING 
CROATIA\'S INALIENABLE RIGHT TO INDEPENDENCE, AS WELL

AND HONOR, AND BY EXTENSION THAT OF THE CROATIAN 
PEOPLE.  THIS LETTER IS MEANT TO SEEK YOUR 
UNDERSTANDING AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE OF MY PAST AND PRESENT POSITION ON THE SUBJECT. 
 
1.  IN 1941, THE NAZI PUPPET REGIME IN OCCUPIED 
CROATIA PUT A PRICE ON MY HEAD.  THE SAME YEAR, A 
LEADING JEWISH PHYSICIAN FLED CROATIA AND ENTRUSTED ME 
WITH THE SAFEKEEPING OF HIS SON. 
 
2.  I FOUGHT THE NAZIS DURING WORLD WAR II AS A MEMBER 
OF THE RESISTANCE FORCES, ATTAINING THE RANK OF 
GENERAL.  MANY CROATIANS FOUGHT AGAINST THE USTASHA 
REGIME OF TERROR AND EVIL AND AGAINST THE NAZI-FASCIST 
OCCUPATION. 
 
3.  MY BROTHER WAS KILLED BY THE NAZIS IN 1943. 
 
4.  MY MOTHER AND FATHER WERE KILLED BY THE COMMUNISTS 
IN 1946.

BECAUSE OF MY ANTI-TOTALITARIAN POLITICAL VIEWS.

6.  I AM UNALTERABLY OPPOSED TO OPPRESSION FROM THE 
RIGHT AND THE LEFT, AND I CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST 
TERMS POSSIBLE THE EVIL GENOCIDE WHICH THE NAZIS AND 
THEIR PUPPET COLLABORATORS IN CROATIA AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES PERPETRATED AGAINST THE JEWS, GYPSIES, 
CROATIANS, SERBS AND OTHER GROUPS. 
 
THE SYSTEMATIC PROCESS THE NAZIS DEVELOPED AND 
IMPLEMENTED TO EXTERMINATE THE JEWS OF EUROPE MADE IT, 
UNDENIABLY, ONE OF THE GREATEST CRIMES IN HISTORY 
AGAINST MANKIND. 
 
IN THIS REGARD, THE USTASHA REGIME OF THE INDEPENDENT 
STATE OF CROATIA COMMITTED COUNTLESS WAR CRIMES AND

CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.  I DEEPLY REGRET THE FACT 
THAT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF CROATIA WAS VICTIMIZED AS 
PART OF THE HOLOCAUST OF WORLD WAR II. 
 
AS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, I WILL OPPOSE 
THE SPECTER OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN CROATIA WHENEVER IT 
REARS ITS UGLY HEAD, AS IT DOES FROM TIME TO TIME IN 
MANY COUNTRIES.  I WILL NOT TOLERATE ANTI-SEMITISM IN 
ANY FORM WHATSOEVER.  ALL CROATIANS INCLUDING CROATIAN 
JEWS KNOW THIS.  I FOUGHT FOR AND STRONGLY SUPPORT THE 
NEW CONSTITUTION OF CROATIA WHICH PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES THE RIGHTS OF ALL 
MINORITIES IN CROATIA. 
 
SINCE MY ELECTION ON APRIL 1, 1990, I HAVE TAKEN THE 
FOLLOWING STEPS IN SUPPORT OF THIS POLICY: 
 
1.  I HAVE ISSUED AN APPEAL SEEKING FUNDS TO RESTORE 
THE DESTROYED JEWISH SYNAGOGUE IN ZAGREB, AND I AM 
WORKING WITH CROATIAN JEWS TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE. 
IN ADDITION, I HAVE RETURNED THE PROPERTY PREVIOUSLY 
CONFISCATED BY THE STATE TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS, THE 
JEWISH COMMUNITY OF CROATIA. 
 
2.  I PUBLICLY ENDORSED THE REPEAL OF THE \"ZIONISM IS 
RACISM\" RESOLUTION IN THE UNITED NATIONS, WHICH PASSED 
THE UN. 
 
3.  I OFFERED TO PROVIDE TRANSIT TO JEWS WISHING TO 
EMIGRATE FROM THE FORMER SOVIET UNION TO ISRAEL.

SUMMARY 
 
 
 
--- 
 
1.  THE CROATIAN PRESS CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON THE 
PROPOSED LAW ON THE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA, 
NOTING THAT PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF TV AND RADIO 
STATIONS WOULD BE PERMITTED IF THE LAW AS DRAFTED 
IS PASSED BY THE CROATIAN ASSEMBLY.  SLOVENE 
DEFENSE MINISTER JANEZ JANSA HAS PRAISED THE 
DEPLOYMENT OF THE UN FORCES, BUT ALSO CAUTIONED 
THAT JNA DEMOBILIZATION WOULD NOT END THE THREAT 
OF FUTURE JNA AGGRESSION.  LOCAL CROATIAN

OFFICIALS FROM AREAS AROUND KNIN HAVE DISCLOSED 
DETAILS OF ALLEGED MISTREATMENT OF CROATS IN THAT 
REGION.  THEY CLAIM THAT THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN 
FORCED FROM JOBS AND HOMES BY SERB CIVILIAN AND 
MILITARY OFFICIALS.  LOOKING TOWARD 
RECONSTRUCTION, THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS 
RECEIVED A DELEGATION FROM THE WORLD BANK TO 
DISCUSS PRIVATIZATION AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT.  END

2.  IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE REPORTED YESTERDAY, THE 
NEW DRAFT LAW ON THE PRESS AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA 
WHICH WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE ASSEMBLY ALLOWS 
PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF RADIO AND TV STATIONS.  THE 
ASSISTANT TO THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION, IGOR 
MRDOLJAS, EXPLAINED THAT THE PRIVATE BROADCAST 
MEDIA \"WILL NOT COMPETE WITH THE STATE OWNED RADIO 
AND TV.\"  ACCORDING.TO MRDOLJAS, IT WILL BE A 
PARALLEL MODEL BASED ON THE SYSTEM USED IN ITALY. 
 
3.  THE PROPOSED NEW LAW ALSO CALLS FOR LARGE 
FINANCIAL PENALTIES TO BE IMPOSED ON PUBLIC 
OFFICIALS FOR NON-DISCLOSURE OF PUBLIC INFORMATION 
TO JOURNALISTS.

5.  JANSA EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM CONCERNING THE 
DEMOBILIZATION OF JNA SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS IN THE 
OCCUPIED TERRITORY OF CROATIA.  HE TOLD 
JOURNALISTS THAT THESE DEMOBILIZED UNITS COULD BE 
EASILY REACTIVATED, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE UN FORCES 
LEVE THE TERRITORY.  ACCORDING TO THE PRESS 
ACCOUNTS, JANSA STATED THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION FOR 
GETTING THE JNA PERMANENTLY OUT OF B-H IS 
RECOGNITION.  JANSA EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT A 
COMPLETE JNA WITHDRAWAL FROM B-H WOULD HAVE A 
SALUTARY EFFECT ON THE SITUATION IN THE KNIN 
KRAJINA.  JANSA CLAIMED THAT THE SLOVENIAN SIDE 
HAD WARNED THE UN AND CARRINGTON THAT JNA 
DEMOBILIZATION WILL NOT ALLEVIATE THE THREAT OF 
FUTURE JNA AGGRESSION.

6.  LOCAL CROATIAN OFFICIALS FROM OBROVAC AND 
BENKOVAC, TWO PREDOMINANTLY SERBIAN TOWNS NEAR 
KNIN, ADDRESSED A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE 
PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE CROATIAN 
ASSEMBLY.  THEY DESCRIBED CRIMES WHICH HAD 
OCCURRED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR TO CROATS 
LIVING IN THE REGION.  THEY ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO

INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN INSTITUTIONS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE LOCAL 
OFFICIALS CRITICIZED INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
FOR NOT ACCEPTING THEIR INVITATIONS TO VISIT TOWNS 
AND VILLAGES UNDER JNA OCCUPATION WHERE CROATS ARE 
IN A MINORITY. 
 
7.  ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIALS\' REPORT, IN THE 
OBROVAC COMMUNITY, 11 PERSONS WERE KILLED, 10 
CITIZENS WERE IMPRISONED AND 4 ARE STILL BEING 
HELD IN CUSTODY IN KNIN.  ALL CATHOLIC CHURCHES IN 
THOSE AND SURROUNDING TOWNS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AS 
WELL AS THE HOMES OF 800 FAMILIES.  FROM THE 
OBROVAC COMMUNITY, OUT OF 3,640 CROATS, 3,430 HAVE 
BEEN EXPELLED.  ONLY ONE CROATIAN WORKER IS 
EMPLOYED IN OBROVAC. 
 
8.  IN THE BENKOVAC COMMUNITY THE SITUATION IS 
EVEN WORSE.  SINCE JULY 1991, 58 PERSONS OF 
CROATIAN NATIONALITY HAVE BEEN KILLED OR BEEN 
REPORTED MISSING.  ALL OF THE HOUSES IN EIGHT 
VILLAGES IN THE BENKOVAC COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN

- 
1.  ON MARCH 19, THE SERBIAN DEMOCRATIC FORUM 
(SDF) INTRODUCED TO THE PUBLIC ITS BUREAU FOR 
REFUGEES, HUMAN RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF NATIONAL 
COMMUNITIES.  THE CENTRAL BUREAU IS LOCATED IN 
ZAGREB.  BRANCH OFFICES WILL BE OPENED SOON IN 
KARLOVAC, SISAK, RIJEKA AND PULA.  LATER, AFTER 
THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE UN PEACEKEEPING FORCES ON 
THE TERRITORY UNDER JNA OCCUPATION, SDF INTENDS TO 
OPEN BRANCH OFFICES IN THAT REGION, AS WELL AS 
SPLIT, ZADAR AND OSIJEK. 
 
2.  APPROXIMATELY 40 PERSONS (INCLUDING CONSULATE 
FSN POL. ANALYST) ATTENDED THE PUBLIC OPENING OF

INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS.  IN HIS SPEECH, PUPOVAC 
EXPRESSED HIS REGRET THAT ALTHOUGH INVITATIONS 
WERE SENT, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT 
COMMITTEES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DID NOT COME TO THE 
RECEPTION. 
 
3.  IN HIS SPEECH, PUPOVAC POINTED OUT THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT IS DRAWING THE WRONG 
CONCLUSION ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE BUREAU.  HOWEVER, 
PUPOVAC HOPES THAT THIS WILL BE CORRECTED AND THE 
SDF BUREAU WILL BE ABLE TO COOPERATE WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S OFFICE FOR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 
THE GOAL OF THE SDF BUREAU IS NOT TO CREATE A 
PARALLEL BODY TO THE GOVERNMENT OFFICE, BUT TO 
COOPERATE AND TO HELP.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE 
BUREAU IS TO COLLECT DATA ON REFUGEES, DISPLACED 
PERSONS AND PRISONERS IN ORDER TO PRESENT THEM TO 
LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANS.  THEREFORE IT IS 
NECESSARY THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF MINORITIES, 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT, EC AND UN BE REPRESENTED IN 
THE BUREAU. 
- 
4.  THE SDF TOOK THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RELEASE THE 
FIRST ISSUE OF ITS BULLETIN IN WHICH CASES OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE MADE PUBLIC.  THE 
BULLETIN INCLUDES A LIST OF NAMES OF MISSING 
PERSONS.  THESE LISTS DO NOT APPLY ONLY TO SERBS, 
BUT TO ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR NATIONALITY.

PERCENT OF THE REPUBLIC\'S ECONOMIC POTENTIAL HAS 
BEEN DAMAGED.  TWO TOURIST SEASONS HAD BEEN LOST 
AND THIS YEAR, THE TOURIST SEASON REMAINS 
UNCERTAIN AT BEST.  NEARLY ONE FOURTH OF CROATIA\'S 
AGRICULTURAL LAND IS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT.  LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL 
ENTERPRISES SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE; 37,500

4.  VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT, JURICA 
PAVELIC, ASSERTED THAT THE BASIC MARKET 
ORIENTATION OF GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICY HAS 
RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC 
ORGANIZATIONS.  PAVELIC PRESENTED A RATHER ROSY 
PICTURE OF THE CROATIAN ECONOMY USING THE 
FOLLOWING INFORMATION.  INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN 
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY WAS 7.B PERCENT HIGHER THAN 
THE AVERAGE THE LAST QUARTER OF 1991 (COMMENT: 
THIS IS HARDLY A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT CONSIDERING 
THAT THE WAR IN CROATIA WAS AT ITS HEIGHT DURING 
THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF 1991.  END COMMENT.).

THROUGH FEBRUARY THIS YEAR, THE EXPORT OF GOODS 
FROM CROATIA AMOUNTED TO USD 487.7 MILLION WHILE 
IMPORTED MERCHANDISE TOTALLED USD 377.8 MILLION. 
 
5.  PAVELIC POINTED OUT THAT SO FAR IN 1992 THE 
GOVERNMENT HAD STRICTLY CONFORMED TO ITS MONETARY 
PROJECTIONS.  HOWEVER, HE WARNED THAT DURING THE 
FIRST 10 DAYS IN MARCH, THE CROATIAN NATIONAL BANK 
HAD INCREASED THE MONETARY SUPPLY BY 4.7 BILLION 
CROATIAN DINARS.  RETAIL PRICES WHICH HAD 
INCREASED BY 25.3 PERCENT IN NOVEMBER ROSE 15 
PERCENT IN FEBRUARY.  ON THE OTHER HAND, SALARIES 
CONTINUED TO DECREASE.  ACCORDING TO PAVELIC, IT 
IS OF GREATEST IMPORTANCE FOR CROATIA TO CHANGE 
ITS ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, AND TO PRIVATIZE SMALL 
ENTERPRISES IN THE FIELD OF TRADE, CATERING AND 
TOURISM.

SUMMARY

2.  ALTHOUGH ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN THE WARRING 
FACTIONS IN CROATIA CONTINUES TO BE OF CONCERN TO 
SERBS AND CROATS, BOTH SIDES (WITH THE ARRIVAL OF UN 
PEACEKEEPING FORCES) HAVE NOW APPARENTLY BEGUN TO 
FOCUS ON A NEW STRATEGY -- THE FORCED EVACUATION OF 
RESIDENTS OF THE OPPOSITE NATIONALITY FROM AREAS 
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE OTHER.  EACH SIDE HAS MADE 
SPECIFIC AND DETAILED CHARGES AGAINST THE OTHER, 
ACCUSING THE GUILTY PARTY OF THREATS, ABUSES, 
EXPULSIONS AND KILLINGS.  ALTHOUGH THE CROATIAN

GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO VIEW HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AS 
POLITICAL QUESTIONS, SOME OFFICIALS, INCLUDING TO 
SOME DEGREE PRESIDENT TUDJMAN, ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE 
A CONNECTION BETWEEN TOLERATION OF VIOLATIONS OF THE 
HUMAN RIGHTS OF SERBS IN CROATIA WITH THE DECLINING 
STATE OF DEMOCRACY IN THE REPUBLIC.  THE PRIME 
MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT HAS SPOKEN OUT STRONGLY 
AGAINST SUCH ABUSES AND INSISTED THAT THE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT MUST RENEW ITS EMPHASIS ON RESPECT FOR THE 
RIGHTS OF CITIZENS, PUBLIC ORDER AND PEACE.  TUDJMAN, 
IN RECENT DAYS, HAS RECEIVED HUMAN RIGHTS DELEGATIONS 
FROM HELSINKI WATCH AND THE EC, AND A DOMESTIC 
AMNESTY COMMITTEE MADE UP OF SERBS AND OPPOSITION 
POLITICAL FIGURES.  IN SPITE OF HELSINKI WATCH\'S 
STRONG CONDEMNATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN 
CROATIA, TUDJMAN HELD A CORDIAL MEETING WITH THE 
ORGANIZATION\'S REPRESENTATIVES AND PROVIDED A 
WELL-CONSIDERED, DETAILED WRITTEN RESPONSE TO THEIR 
FINDINGS.  IN A COMPLETE CHANGE OF TONE, THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S REPLY THANKED HELSINKI WATCH FOR ITS 
INTEREST IN EVENTS IN CROATIA AND THE OBJECTIVE 
EVALUATION OF ITS REPORT. 
- 
3.  WESTERN PRESSURE ON THIS ISSUE HAS HAD SOME 
SUCCESS, AT LEAST IN TERMS OF ATTITUDINAL SHIFTS BY 
CROATIAN LEADERS.  IT IS NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT 
THIS HAS TRANSLATED INTO MORE FORCEFUL ACTION TO CURB 
ABUSES.  IF ANYTHING, HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ON THE 
CROAT SIDE MAY HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT WEEKS.  WE 
HAVE NOT SENSED A CONCURRENT UPSURGE IN 
INVESTIGATIONS AND ARRESTS (THOUGH THE PICTURE ON

--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4.  WITH THE \"HOT\" WAR ABATING, DAMPENED BY THE 
ARRIVAL OF UN PEACEKEEPING FORCES, THE FIGHT OVER 
LAND (WITH ORDINARY CITIZENS AS THE COMBATANTS) IS 
HEATING UP.  EMBASSY BELGRADE AND CONGEN ZAGREB HAVE 
REPORTED ON THE EFFORTS OF BOTH SIDES TO FORCE 
CIVILIANS TO FLEE THEIR HOMES AND RESETTLE EITHER 
CROATS OR SERBS IN THE ABANDONED PROPERTIES IN ORDER 
TO REARRANGE THE ETHNIC MAKE-UP OF ENTIRE VILLAGES 
AND TOWNS.  EVEN IN THE LARGER CITIES, THERE HAVE

BEEN CHARGES THAT A CLIMATE OF FEAR AND INTIMIDATION 
HAS BEEN CREATED TO PRESSURE MEMBERS OF ONE ETHNIC 
GROUP TO LEAVE, THEREBY REDUCING THE PERCENTAGE OF 
THAT GROUP WITHIN THE OVERALL POPULATION.  THE 
FOLLOWING SCORE CARDS ARE NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE, OTHERS 
SUCH AS HELSINKI WATCH HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO COMPILE 
SUCH DATA.  THE OBJECTIVE HERE IS RATHER TO HIGHLIGHT 
THE MAJOR CASES AND GIVE A SENSE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AS 
THE UN PEACEKEEPERS BEGIN TO ARRIVE. 
- 
5.  ON THE SERB SIDE, CASES OF ABUSE ARE REPORTED 
ALMOST DAILY IN THE BELGRADE PRESS.  LOCAL ZAGREB 
BASED HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE ALSO KEEPING TRACK, 
THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO VERIFY THE REPORTS OF EVEN 
THE MOST CREDIBLE SOURCE.  FOR AN UPDATE, WE SPOKE 
WITH SERBIAN ACTIVIST MILORAD PUPOVAC ON MARCH 25, 
WHO CONFIRMED THAT PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BE EXERTED 
ON THE SERBIAN COMMUNITY OF CROATIA.  PUPOVAC AGAIN 
EXPRESSED PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT THE FORCED FLIGHT 
OF URBAN SERBS.  MOST RECENTLY, IN THE MAJOR COASTAL 
CITY OF ZADAR, THE SERBIAN LEADER CLAIMED THAT THE 
HOMES AND PROPERTY OF SERBS WHO HAVE TEMPORARILY LEFT 
ARE BEING \"MINED AND BLOWN UP.\"  IN THE CASE OF 
ZAGREB, PUPOVAC ESTIMATED THAT PERHAPS HALF OF THE 
SERBS WHO HAD BEEN RESIDING IN THE CROATIAN CAPITAL 
HAD LEFT, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.  HE POINTED TO THE 
NON-PAYMENT OF PENSIONS TO RETIRED JNA OFFICERS 
(WHICH HE SAID HAD A GREATER IMPACT ON THE SERBIAN 
COMMUNITY) AS A SERIOUS MATTER WHICH COULD LEAD TO 
ABANDONMENT OF HOUSES AND APARTMENTS SINCE THE 
RESIDENT ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR UTILITY SERVICES AND 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

ROUTINELY RECEIVE THEIR JNA PENSIONS.)

6.  AS HE DID IN OUR PREVIOUS MEETINGS, PUPOVAC CITED 
A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC AND DETAILED ABUSES AGAINST 
SERBS.  HE ADMITTED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS HAD 
BEEN INVESTIGATED BY CROATIAN OFFICIALS.  BUT WHILE 
MANY IN THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THAT THOSE 
RESPONSIBLE SHOULD BE PUNISHED, IT APPEARED THAT THE 
MORE HARD-LINE ELEMENT HOLDS GREAT SWAY AT THE 
MOMENT.  HERE ARE SOME OF THE SPECIFICS PUPOVAC 
CITED.  (FYI:  ALL OF THESE CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED 
EARLIER BY EITHER CONGEN, EMBASSY OR HELSINKI WATCH.) 
- 
--  GOSPIC:  PUPOVAC SAID 180 SERBS HAD DISAPPEARED 
THERE.  SIXTY-THREE WERE CONFIRMED DEAD, THE REST ARE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00468  03 OF 09  310736Z 
PRESUMED JAILED OR DEAD.  IN SEPARATE INSTANCES, 
SERBS FROM ZAGREB HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED FROM ZAGREB AND 
TAKEN TO GOSPIC.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SEVERAL OF OUR 
CONTACTS THAT THE CROATIAN SIDE WAS KIDNAPPING SERBS 
TO USE AS BARTER TO OBTAIN THE RETURN OF CAPTURED 
CROATIAN CIVILIANS. 
 
--  PUPOVAC SAID SERBS WHO RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES 
AFTER FLEEING THE FIGHTING WERE BEING MISTREATED.  HE 
CITED THE CASE OF DARUVAR, WHERE HE SAID SIGNS WERE 
POSTED LISTING 9,000 NAMES OF AREA SERB RESIDENTS; 
THESE SIGNS ACCUSED ALL OF THEM OF BEING ENEMIES OF 
CROATIA AND CALLED FOR THEIR EXPULSION. 
 
--  HE SAID 100 SERBS FROM VIROVITICA HAD DISAPPEARED. 
 
7.  MORE GENERALLY, PUPOVAC SAID THAT WHILE HE FOUND 
SOME MEMBERS OF THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT INDIVIDUALLY 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE 
PROBLEMS FACING SERB-CROAT RELATIONS IN AN 
INDEPENDENT CROATIA (HE SPECIFICALLY SPOKE OF HAVING 
A LONG AND USEFUL TALK WITH OPPOSITION LEADER DRAZEN 
BUDISA WHILE HE WAS STILL IN THE GOVERNMENT AND OF 
GOOD CONTACTS WITH SAVKA DABCEVIC-KUCAR, AN 
UNANNOUNCED CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT), TUDJMAN HIMSELF 
DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CREDIBILITY WITH SERBS TO 
REACH AN ACCORD WITH THEM, AND THE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE IS NOT READY TO SOLVE THE 
PROBLEMS OF URBAN SERBS IN CROATIA.  IN HIS MOST 
PESSIMISTIC NOTE, PUPOVAC SPECULATED THAT CROATIAN 
AUTHORITIES ARE ACTUALLY HOPING THAT THE FEAR AND

OF BOKSIC, NEAR VUKOVAR, WERE EXPELLED BY SERBIAN 
TERRITORIAL DEFENSE UNITS FROM THE NEARBY VILLAGE OF 
CAKOVAC.

--  IN TORDINCI, A VILLAGE IN SLAVONIA WHICH HAS BEEN 
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE JNA FOR ALMOST FIVE MONTHS, 
30 INNOCENT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.  THE CROATS 
ALLEGED THAT THEIR BODIES WERE BURIED IN A MASS GRAVE 
NEAR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.

THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT: GROWING CONCERNS

10.  ALTHOUGH THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO 
VIEW HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AS POLITICAL PROBLEMS, WHICH 
ACCOUNTS FOR ITS ALMOST TIT-FOR-TAT REPORTING OF 
SERBIAN VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHTS OF CROATS, THERE IS 
A GROWING SENSE THAT THE OVERALL SECURITY SITUATION 
IN THE REPUBLIC IS SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL. 
GENERAL CRIME IS ON THE RISE AND THERE IS A GROWING 
BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND ORDER.  AT LEAST SOME OFFICIALS 
IN THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE THE CONNECTION 
BETWEEN TOLERATION OF VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
AGAINST SERBS AND THE DECLINING STATE OF DEMOCRACY IN 
THE REPUBLIC.

EDITION OF THE POLITICAL INFLUENTIAL DAILY \"VJESNIK\", 
SOME CASES WERE REVEALED ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF 
PERSONS IN CROATIAN UNIFORMS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS FOR 
WHOM THE WAR HAS BECOME A COVER-UP FOR THE

AMNESTY COMMITTEE MADE UP OF SERBS AND OPPOSITION 
FIGURES.  IN PARTICULAR, CROATIA\'S RESPONSE TO THE 
HELSINKI WATCH REPORT ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN 
CROATIA DID NOT HAVE THE DEFENSIVE, PRICKLY SLANT 
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT NORMALLY TAKES IN RESPONDING TO 
SUCH ALLEGATIONS.  TO BE SURE, THE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHIDE HELSINKI 
WATCH FOR NOT BEING MORE INTERESTED IN THE PLIGHT OF 
CROATS IN THE SO-CALLED JNA-OCCUPIED REGIONS.  BUT 
THE CROATIAN REPLY WAS DETAILED AND REVEALED CLEARLY 
THAT THE CROATS HAD TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE ALLEGATIONS.

CROATS APPEARED TO REACT IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY TO THE 
CHARGES AND ADMITTED SHORTCOMINGS IN ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL OF ITS 
CITIZENS.  IN ITS INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT, THE TUDJMAN 
GOVERNMENT DECLARED THAT \"THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT IS 
AWARE THAT SOME CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED ALSO BY 
PERSONS WEARING THE UNIFORMS OF THE CROATIAN FORCES,\" 
BUT QUICKLY NOTED THAT \"THESE PERSONS HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED AND PROSECUTED.\"  THE STATEMENT ROUNDLY AND 
UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMNED SUCH CRIMES, INDICATED THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT HAD REQUESTED FROM ITS DEPARTMENTS 
REPORTS ON VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONCLUDED 
THAT \"SPECIAL STRESS IS ON THEIR GREATER COMMITMENT 
TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR CASES.\"  AND, IN 
A MOST ATYPICAL TONE, EXPRESSED \"THANKS TO THE 
HELSINKI WATCH COMMITTEE FOR THE ATTENTION IT HAS 
DEDICATED TO THE EVENTS IN CROATIA AND FOR THE 
ATTEMPT TO PRESENT THE FACTS ABOUT ABUSES IN AN 
OBJECTIVE MANNER.\" 
 
17.  COMMENT:  ARE WE BEGINNING TO SEE A KINDER, 
GENTLER CROATIAN PRESIDENT ON THE ISSUE OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS?  WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT 
OUR MANY PROTESTATIONS TO TUDJMAN AND HIS AIDES ON 
THESE QUESTIONS ARE FINALLY STARTING TO PAY 
DIVIDENDS, BUT WE ARE NOT FULLY CONVINCED OF THIS. 
FOR TUDJMAN, HUMAN RIGHTS IS STILL A NAGGING 
POLITICAL ISSUE.  OTHERS (GREGURIC, TOMAC) MAY BE 
SINCERELY TROUBLED BY THIS INCREASING SPIRAL OF 
VIOLENCE.  FOR THEM, OUR PRESSURE AND THAT OF OTHERS 
MAY HAVE HAD AN IMPACT IN MAKING IT CLEAR TO THEM

SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION 
------------------------ 
 
2.  ON THE DAY AFTER U.S. RECOGNITION OF THE 
REPUBLICS OF CROATIA AND SLOVENIA, WE BELIEVE IT 
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO CATCH OUR BREATH AND TAKE AN 
ACCOUNTING OF WHERE WE ARE, HOW WE GOT TO THIS POINT 
AND SOME EARLY IMPRESSIONS ON HOW WE SEE OUR 
RELATIONS DEVELOPING WITH THESE NEW EUROPEAN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00527  01 OF 07  091302Z 
NATIONS.  IN THE CASE OF SLOVENIA, OUR VIEW IS THAT, 
WITHOUT STRONG, OUTWARD-LOOKING LEADERSHIP, THE TINY 
REPUBLIC COULD CONCEIVABLY FALL OFF THE RADAR SCREEN 
(ONCE THE YUGOSLAV CRISIS PASSES WHICH WILL OBVIOUSLY 
NOT OCCUR ANYTIME SOON).  DESTINED TO FALL PREY TO A 
GERMAN-AUSTRIAN-ITALIAN SUZERAINTY BY VIRTUE OF ITS 
SIZE AND GEOGRAPHY, SLOVENES ARE ALREADY EXPRESSING 
PREVIOUSLY INDETECTABLE ANGST OVER DOMINATION BY 
THEIR POWERFUL NEIGHBORS.  REGRETTABLY, WE CONCLUDE 
THAT THIS ECONOMIC TURN OF EVENTS IS UNAVOIDABLE.  WE 
WOULD ALSO NOT BE SURPRISED IF SLOVENIA TOOK THE LEAD 
IN TRYING TO REBUILD YUGOSLAV ECONOMIC LINKAGES. 
WITH SLOVENIA NOT POSING A THREAT TO ITS NEIGHBORS, 
ITS NASCENT DEMOCRACY NOT AT RISK AND NO HUMAN RIGHTS 
PROBLEMS, THE U.S. HAS NO STRATEGIC INTERESTS AT 
STAKE. 
 
3.  CROATIA, ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL REMAIN OF KEEN 
INTEREST TO U.S. POLICY-MAKERS.  CROATIAN-SERBIAN 
RELATIONS COULD WELL BE THE KEY ISSUE IN THE BALKANS 
FOR YEARS TO COME.  ALWAYS SLOW OFF THE MARK 
VIS-A-VIS THE SLOVENES, THE CROATS WERE LESS PREPARED 
FOR THIS HISTORIC STEP.  ITS DEMOCRACY IS MORE 
FRAGILE THAN THAT OF ITS NORTHERN NEIGHBOR, WITH 
MAJOR ISSUES OF PRESS FREEDOMS, A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL 
LEGAL SYSTEM, AND TROUBLESOME DRIFT OF THE POLITICAL 
CENTER OF GRAVITY TO THE RIGHT.  CROATIAN PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN, AS THE MAN WHO DELIVERED ON INTERNATIONAL 
RECOGNITION, SEEMS A SURE BET FOR A SECOND TERM.  HE 
WILL FACE THE TOUGH TASK OF DISMANTLING, OR LEAST 
DIMINISHING THE IMPACT, OF A SECURITY AND MILITARY

SLOVENIA: FROM LEADING ROLE TO BIT PLAYER 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  WHEN THE HISTORY OF THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA IS 
FINALLY WRITTEN, ONE OF THE THE SMALLEST REPUBLICS IN 
THE FORMER FEDERATION WILL BE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING 
PLAYED THE KEY ROLE IN MOVING YUGOSLAVIA WESTWARD 
TOWARD DEMOCRACY, A TREND WHICH WOULD ULTIMATELY SET 
THE STAGE FOR THE COUNTRY\'S DEMISE.  WITH ITS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00527  02 OF 07  091303Z 
REPUBLIC-LEVEL ELECTIONS IN 1990, SLOVENIA CONDUCTED 
THE FIRST FREE BALLOTING IN YUGOSLAVIA, A WATERSHED 
EVENT THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO CALLS IN THE 
OTHER REPUBLICS FOR FREE ELECTIONS.  IN A DOGGED AND 
DETERMINED FASHION WHICH FLOWS NATURALLY FROM THE 
SLOVENE NATIONAL CHARACTER, THE NORTHERN REPUBLIC SET 
A COURSE TOWARD DEMOCRACY BUT ALSO AWAY FROM 
YUGOSLAVIA AND SIMPLY REFUSED TO BE TURNED AROUND. 
 
5.  TO REACH ITS GOAL, SLOVENIA FORGED AN ALLIANCE OF 
CONVENIENCE WITH CROATIA TO CHALLENGE A RECALCITRANT, 
CENTRALIST FEDERAL SYSTEM.  WHETHER THE INTENTION 
FROM THE BEGINNING WAS TO BREAK UP YUGOSLAVIA AS IT 
THEN EXISTED WILL NEVER BE KNOWN (WE SUSPECT THAT IT 
ALWAYS WAS).  SLOVENE HISTORY WILL RECALL THAT 
BELGRADE WAS NEVER WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THE IDEA OF 
RESTRUCTURING YUGOSLAVIA INTO THE MORE DEMOCRATIC, 
LOOSE CONFEDERATION OF SOVEREIGN STATES PROPOSED BY 
SLOVENIA AND SUPPORTED BY ITS NOMINAL ALLY, CROATIA. 
THE HOLLOW TALKS THAT WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE LATTER 
HALF OF 1990 AND THE FIRST HALF OF 1991 BETWEEN THE 
SIX REPUBLICS LED INEXORABLY TO WHERE SLOVENIA WANTED 
TO BE FROM THE BEGINNING, THE DECLARATION OF AN 
INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN REPUBLIC IN JUNE, 1991.

BRIEF WAR OF \"LIBERATION\", SLOVENIA\'S ROLE IN THE

7.  ALTHOUGH CURRENTLY STRAPPED IN A POLITICAL 
STRAITJACKET AND UNABLE TO BREAK FREE, DEMOCRACY IS 
ALIVE AND WELL IN SLOVENIA.  AT SOME POINT, A NEW

AND A NEW GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO DEMOCRATIC 
PRINCIPLES AND A MARKET ECONOMY WILL BE SELECTED TO

MARKS USED IN THE PURCHASE OF PREVIOUSLY SOCIALLY- 
OWNED APARTMENTS. 
 
9.   ULTIMATELY SLOVENIA\'S DESTINY WILL BE DETERMINED 
BY ITS LOCATION.  WITH NO HINTERLAND TO SPEAK OF, WE 
ENVISION A SLOVENIA THAT WILL OF NECESSITY BECOME 
\"REGIONALIZED.\"  THE INDUSTRIALIZED NORTH (MARIBOR) 
WILL NEED LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO MODERNIZE AND 
TRANSFORM ITS FACTORIES AND PLANTS.  VIRTUALLY A 
SUBURB OF AUSTRIA\'S SECOND LARGEST CITY (GRAZ), 
NORTHERN SLOVENIA, WHICH IS ALREADY SEEKING MORE 
LOCAL AUTONOMY FROM A FARAWAY (IN THE SLOVENE 
CONTEXT) LJUBLJANA, WILL ALMOST BY INERTIA FALL INTO 
THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OF SOUTHERN AUSTRIA.  TO THE 
WEST, PARTICULARLY ISTRIA, ITALY IS KING.  SLOVENES 
(AND CROATS, TOO) FROM THAT REGION DO NOT HESITATE IN 
IDENTIFYING WITH THEIR ITALIAN ROOTS.  THIS WEEK, 
SLOVENIAN (AND CROATIAN) POLITICAL PARTIES MET WITH 
PARTIES FROM ACROSS THE BORDER TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEY 
WOULD SEEK TO \"REGIONALIZE\" THEIR ACTIVITIES AND 
PURSUE COMMON POLITICAL GOALS. 
 
10.  IF SLOVENIA IS TO MAINTAIN SOME CONTROL OVER ITS 
ECONOMIC DESTINY, RESTORING SOME SEMBLANCE OF THE 
YUGOSLAV MARKET WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. 
FROM THE BEGINNING, IDEOLOGY HAS PLAYED LITTLE OR NO 
ROLE IN THE DRIVE FOR INDEPENDENCE.  ONCE A WAY OUT

U.S.-SLOVENE RELATIONS 
---------------------- 
 
11.  AS PRESIDENT KUCAN TOLD THE CG ON APRIL 8 WHEN 
HE PRESENTED OUR LETTER OF RECOGNITION, SLOVENIA 
EXPECTS TO HAVE THE MOST CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH THE 
U.S. FROM THE START.  WE SEE NO REASON TO QUESTION 
THAT ASSESSMENT.  BUT, AGAIN, GIVEN THE NEW 
INDEPENDENT COUNTRY\'S SIZE AND LOCATION, WE SEE NO 
VITAL OR STRATEGIC U.S. INTERESTS.  SLOVENIA HAS NO 
HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS, POSES NO THREAT TO ITS 
NEIGHBORS, AND HAS NO LARGE, INFLUENTIAL EMIGRE

COMMUNITY IN THE U.S.  ITS DOMESTIC MARKET IS 
INHERENTLY SMALL AND MAJOR U.S. INVESTMENT POTENTIAL 
WILL BE LIMITED. 
 
12.  WITHOUT AN OUTWARD LOOKING LEADER WITH A 
EUROPEAN VIEW (E.G., SOMEONE LIKE JANEZ DRNOVSEK, THE 
FORMER FEDERAL PRESIDENT), SLOVENIA COULD BECOME AN 
INSULAR, INWARD LOOKING COUNTRY, FEARFUL OF THE KIND 
OF CHANGE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION THREATENS TO BRING TO 
THE TWELVE.  BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE, SLOVENE LEADERS, 
WITHOUT EXCEPTION, UNDERSTAND FULLY THE LIMITED 
INFLUENCE THEY WILL HAVE ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF 
THE DAY.  BUT, LEFT WITHOUT A LEADER WITH VISION, 
SLOVENIA COULD FIND ITSELF MARGINALIZED.  THE ODDEST 
TWIST OF FATE WOULD BE FOR THE REPUBLIC THAT TOOK THE 
FIRST STEP DOWN THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY AND EUROPE 
COULD WELL END UP ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF EUROPE, A 
VICTIM OF ITS SIZE AND GEOGRAPHY.

CROATIA: A FATE OF ETERNAL STRUGGLE WITH SERBIA 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
13.  IN CONTRAST, IF SLOVENIA\'S FATE IS ULTIMATELY 
TIED TO ITS GEOGRAPHY, THEN CROATIA\'S IS CONNECTED TO 
ITS HISTORIC ENTANGLEMENT WITH SERBIA, REINFORCED BY 
THE VOLATILE ISSUE OF THE STATUS OF CROATIA\'S LARGE 
SERBIAN MINORITY.  CROATIAN-SERBIAN RELATIONS WILL BE 
THE KEY ISSUE IN THE BALKANS FOR YEARS TO COME.  AND, 
AS THE CURRENT TROUBLES IN BOSNIA CLEARLY SHOW, THE 
STATE OF THOSE RELATIONS HAS CONSEQUENCES BEYOND THE 
BORDERS OF BOTH REPUBLICS.

15.  AS WE HAVE BEEN REGULARLY REPORTING, CROATIA\'S 
SECURITY WOES THREATEN TO UNDERMINE THE SHAKY STATE 
OF THE YOUNG DEMOCRACY OF THE REPUBLIC.  FIRST, THE 
POLITICAL CENTER HAS MOVED DECIDEDLY TO THE RIGHT, 
WITH EVEN SOCIALIST AND LIBERAL PARTIES TAKING A HARD 
LINE ON REGAINING \"LOST\" TERRITORY.  SECOND, 
NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO 
EXHIBIT ANY DEGREE OF OBJECTIVITY HAVE FOUND 
THEMSELVES FACING DECLINING CIRCULATION.  THIRD, THE 
TELEVISION CHANNELS SPOUT AN UNABASHEDLY 
PRO-GOVERNMENT LINE THAT, FRANKLY, MAY HAVE MORE TO 
DO WITH HOW THEY VIEW THEIR AUDIENCE THAN ACTUAL 
DIRECTIVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  (NEVERTHELESS, THE 
LEADERSHIP OF CROATIAN TV REMAINS FIRMLY ENTRENCHED 
IN THE HANDS OF TUDJMAN CRONIES.)  FINALLY, MORE AND 
MORE WE ARE RECEIVING REPORTS THAT EVEN CROATS ARE 
RELUCTANT TO SEEK HELP FROM POLICE OFFICIALS WHEN 
THEY ARE THE VICTIMS OF ORDINARY CRIMES. 
 
16.  IT\'S THIS LATTER POINT THAT TROUBLES CROATS THE 
MOST.  MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WILL BE 
EASY TO RETURN CROATIA TO A STATE OF LAW, ORDER AND 
RESPECT FOR BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.  THE 
TENTACLES OF A PERVASIVE AND INTRUSIVE SECURITY 
APPARATUS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FORMER COMMUNIST 
SECURITY OFFICIAL AND TUDJMAN ALLY JOSIP MANOLIC 
REACHES FAR AND WIDE.  IT\'S NOT JUST A QUESTION OF 
GETTING THE GENIE BACK IN THE BOTTLE AS MUCH AS IT IS 
FINDING A BOTTLE LARGE ENOUGH TO RESTRAIN AND CONTAIN

THE EFFECT OF THE VIOLENCE AND FIGHTING ON THE

TANGIBLE AND PERVASIVE.  WITH THOUSANDS OF AMCITS OF 
CROATIAN DESCENT ACTIVELY SUPPORTING CROATIAN 
INDEPENDENCE AND TRAVELLING BACK AND FORTH, U.S. 
INTERESTS CUT ACROSS ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND 
FAMILY CONNECTIONS.  FROM ACROSS THE SPECTRUM IN 
CROATIAN SOCIETY, THE WORKING ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE 
U.S. WILL INEVITABLY PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN THE

IS THE ULTIMATE HOPE OF THOSE WHO DOUBT THE MOTIVES

HOPES FOR CLOSE, FRIENDLY TIES, THAT RELATIONSHIP 
WILL BE AT TIMES STRAINED BY ALMOST INESCAPABLE HUMAN 
RIGHTS PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE WAR AND OTHER ISSUES 
OF DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT.  THE EC WILL, OF COURSE, 
HAVE A ROLE.  BUT POLITICAL LEADERS AND ORDINARY 
CITIZENS WILL LOOK TO THE U.S. TO TAKE THE LEAD. 
MORE SO THAN THE SLOVENES, THE CROATS SEE THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE AS THE MODEL THEY WOULD PREFER 
TO EMULATE, WITH CERTAIN CROATIAN-INSPIRED 
MODIFICATIONS.  STRUCTURAL CHANGES ASIDE, THE REAL 
TEST OF GOVERNING ULTIMATELY RESTS ON ACTIONS TAKEN. 
CROATIA HAS A HARDER ROAD TO TRAVEL THAN SLOVENIA IN

STATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 
 
AT ITS SESSION ON MAY 4, 1992, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA REVIEWED THE STATE OF SECURITY IN 
THE REPUBLIC IN THE WAKE OF INTENSIFIED AGGRESSIVE 
MOVES BY THE FORMER YUGOSLAV PEOPLE\'S ARMY (JNA), 
SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO AGAINST CROATIA.  THE 
GOVERNMENT ALSO CONSIDERED THE AFTERMATH OF THE 
ATTACK ON THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA & HERCEGOVINA AND 
ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: 
 
1.  THE FORMER JNA AND THE REPUBLICS OF SERBIA AND 
MONTENEGRO, IN THEIR REFUSAL TO ABIDE BY SOME BASIC 
STANDARDS PREVAILING IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
TODAY AND RELATED TO THE PROHIBITION OF WAR 
OPERATIONS, THE PROVISIONS OF THE GENEVA AND SARAJEVO 
AGREEMENTS ON THE CEASEFIRE IN CROATIA, THE 
RESPECTIVE UN PEACE PLAN AND OTHER DOCUMENTS ISSUED 
BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, HAVE RENEWED THEIR 
ATTACKS AT CROATIA WITH INCREASED INTENSITY AND 
APPLICATION OF HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS FORBIDDEN 
BY INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS.  WANTON DEVASTATION OF 
OSIJEK, VINKOVICI, ZADAR, METKOVIC AND OTHER TOWNS 
AND PLACES GO ON UNABATED.  THE ATTACK ON SLAVONSKI 
BROD IS AN EXAMPLE OF A BRUTAL CRIME COMMITTED 
AGAINST INNOCENT CIVILIANS, DEFENCELESS WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN.  THE AGGRESSORS CONTINUE TO BURN DOWN 
DWELLING AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, TO EXPEL CROATS 
AND OTHER NON-SERBIANS FROM OCCUPIED AREAS AND TO 
LAUNCH INSIDIOUS ATTACKS AT CIVILIAN TARGETS AND THE 
CROATIAN ARMY DEFENCE POSITIONS.  SUCH ATTACKS, AS

2.  IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT THE SPREAD OF 
AGGRESSION TO THE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED REPUBLIC 
OF BOSNIA & HERCEGOVINA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED:  THE 
OBVIOUS OBJECTIVE IS TO SUBJUGATE THIS REPUBLIC 
MILITARILY, TO CHANGE THE ETHNIC STRUCTURE OF SOME OF 
ITS AREAS AND TO FORCE IT INTO JOINING THE SO-CALLED 
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA.

BOSNIA & HERCEGOVINA ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE HEART OF 
EUROPE, BEFORE THE VERY EYES OF THE WORLD.  BY 
PLAYING SOFT WITH THE AGGRESSORS AND FAILING TO TAKE 
SPECIFIC ACTIONS AGAINST THEM THE DEMOCRATIC STATES 
AND THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE MAKING 
THEMSELVES MORE AND MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
CONTINUING TOLL IN HUMAN LIVES.  CONTINUOUS 
POSTPONEMENT OF EFFICIENT SANCTIONS AGAINST THE 
AGGRESSORS ENABLES THEM TO EXPAND THEIR CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITIES, DAY IN, DAY OUT, WHICH MAKES THE 
INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE DEMOCRATIC STATES 
AS PARTIES TO INTERNATIONAL COVENANTS NOT ONLY 
MORALLY, BUT ALSO ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE, FOR FAILING 
TO DO WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO IN ORDER TO HELP 
INNOCENT PEOPLE. 
 
4.  THE RIGHT TO LIVE, THE RIGHT TO DEFEND ONE\'S LIFE 
AND THE DUTY TO HELP ENDANGERED HUMAN BEINGS ARE 
MOTIVES BEHIND THE PRESENT MESSAGE OF THE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT EXPRESSING THE BITTERNESS OF HELPLESS 
WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS WELL AS OTHER INNOCENT VICTIMS 
OF THE AGGRESSIVE WAR WAGED AGAINST CROATIA AND 
BOSNIA & HERCEGOVINA.  ON THEIR BEHALF AND BASED ON

THE COMMITMENT OF MEMBER STATES TO TAKE ACTIONS 
AGAINST THE AGGRESSOR AND TO HELP THE VICTIM OF 
AGGRESSION, AS WELL AS OTHER UN CHARTER PROVISIONS

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) IN A MAY 18 CONVERSATION WITH UNPROFOR 
OFFICIAL MIKAEL MAGNUSSON, MAGNUSSON SAID THAT WHILE 
CROATIAN FORCES WERE HOLDING TO AGREEMENTS IN SECTOR 
EAST, THE JNA APPEARED TO BE BENDING THE AGREED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

TIMETABLE.  CROATIAN ARMY AUTHORITIES WERE UPSET BY 
REPORTS OF AN EXTENSION GRANTED TO THE JNA BY 
UNPROFOR TO WITHDRAW JNA HEAVY ARTILLERY FROM SECTOR 
EAST.  MEANWHILE, CROATIAN VICE PRESIDENT MILAN 
RAMLJAK COMPLAINED BITTERLY TO UN GENERAL NAMBIAR 
ABOUT THE ALLEGED EXPULSION OF 98 CIVILIANS FROM 
SECTOR EAST BY SERB FORCES AFTER UNPROFOR TOOK OVER 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REGION.  FROM THE CROATIAN 
PERSPECTIVE, THESE EVENTS CONTINUE TO PUT INTO 
QUESTION THE ABILITY OF UNPROFOR TO CARRY OUT ITS        . 
MISSION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
UNPROFOR COMMENTS ON SECTOR EAST 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) WE QUERIED UNPROFOR ZAGREB SENIOR LIAISON 
OFFICER FOR CIVILIAN AFFAIRS MIKAEL MAGNUSSON 
(PROTECT) MAY 18 ON THE STATUS OF UN PEACEKEEPING 
OPERATIONS IN SECTOR EAST (OSIJEK, VINKOVCI, VUKOVAR, 
ETC.).  IN FRANK AND ADMITTEDLY UNOFFICIAL 
COMMENTARY, MAGNUSSON TOLD US THAT OPERATIONS IN THAT 
SECTOR WERE PROCEEDING \"STICKINGLY\".  WHILE CROATIAN 
FORCES WERE ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TIMETABLE 
FOR WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR FORCES FROM THE REGION, THE 
JNA, EXPLAINED MAGNUSSON, WAS APPARENTLY TRYING TO 
\"BEND\" THE TIMETABLE.  WHILE THE REASONS FOR JNA 
RELUCTANCE TO WITHDRAW WERE NOT CLEAR, MAGNUSSON\'S 
UNDERSTANDING (THOUGH HE COULD NOT CONFIRM THIS) WAS 
THAT THE JNA HAD RECEIVED UNPROFOR PERMISSION TO 
EXTEND THE DEADLINE BY WHICH HEAVY ARTILLERY WAS TO 
BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE UNPA.  THE JNA IN SECTOR EAST 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00780  01 OF 03  191250Z

THAT UNPA BY 1600 ON MAY 20.  THE ORIGINAL DEADLINE 
WAS SET FOR 0800 ON MAY 18.

3.  (C) MAGNUSSON NOTED THE CEASEFIRE VIOLATIONS THAT 
HAD TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, PARTICULARLY 
AROUND OSIJEK.  UNPROFOR PATROLS WERE COVERING ALL OF 
SECTOR EAST, HE EXPLAINED, AND RANDOM PATROLS WERE 
BEING RUN IN CRISIS AREAS OUTSIDE THE UNPA.  SO FAR, 
SAID MAGNUSSON, UN PEACEKEEPERS WERE \"TAKING NAMES, 
BUT NOT KICKING ASS.\"  THEY HAD FILED COMPLAINTS WITH 
THE JNA CONCERNING THE SLOWNESS OF ITS WITHDRAWAL.

4.  (U) IMMEDIATE CROATIAN REACTION TO THE 
UNPROFOR-GRANTED EXTENSION CAME FROM THE DEPUTY 
CROATIAN COMMANDER OF THE OSIJEK OPERATIONAL ZONE 
BRANIMIR GLAVAS.  GLAVAS TOLD REPORTERS THAT CROATIAN 
FORCES WERE OPPOSED TO AGREEMENTS IN WHICH THEY WERE 
NOT CONSULTED (NOTE:  REPORTEDLY, THE CROATIAN ARMY 
WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS 
REGARDING THE EXTENSION).  GLAVAS ADDED THAT THE ARMY 
WOULD DO WHAT ITS GOVERNMENT ASKED IT TO DO BUT THAT 
IT WOULD NOT BE NAIVE.  HE CONTINUED BY SAYING THAT 
\"IF BY PEACEFUL MEANS, CROATIAN TERRITORY CANNOT BE 
LIBERATED, THEN WE WILL THANK UNPROFOR AND SAY DEAR 
SIRS, NOW IT IS FOR US TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE.\"  GLAVAS 
CONCLUDED THAT THROUGH ACTIONS SUCH AS THE EXTENSION, 
UNPROFOR WAS LOSING ITS POLITICAL CREDIBILITY. 
 
CROATIAN ANGER OVER MORE EXPULSIONS

5.  (U) CROATIAN VICE PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT OF THE 
STATE COMMISSION FOR UNPROFOR MILAN RAMLJAK ADDRESSED 
A SHARPLY WORDED LETTER TO UN COMMANDER SATISH 
NAMBIAR MAY 18 COMPLAINING OF FURTHER EXPULSIONS OF 
CIVILIANS FROM SECTOR EAST BY SERB/JNA FORCES.  THE

ANGERED BY FURTHER EXPULSIONS 
 
QUESTION OF A CRIME COMMITTED IN THE SECTOR WHICH IS 
UNDER YOUR CONTROL.  ACCORDING TO PARAGRAPH 12 OF 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION NO. 752, YOU TOOK OVER 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS SECTOR ON MAY 15, 1992 AND 
THEREFORE YOU ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXILE 
AND SUFFERING OF THESE UNFORTUNATE PERSONS.  THEY 
EXPECTED YOUR PROTECTION, INSTEAD THEY WERE EXPOSED 
TO THE RUDEST VIOLENCE. 
--  IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE EXILE 
WAS DONE WITH THE PROTECTION AND KNOWLEDGE OF 
UNPROFOR.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THIS IS A CASE OF FAILURE IN 
THE EXECUTION OF THE PEACE OPERATION IN SECTOR \"E\"

AND THEREFORE I REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING: 
 
--  UNPROFOR UNITS MUST URGENTLY ORGANIZE THE RETURN 
OF THESE 98 REFUGEES TO THEIR HOMES GIVING THEM FULL 
ASSISTANCE. 
 
--  TO ESTABLISH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUTHORIZED 
COMMANDER WHO FAILED TO UNDERTAKE NECESSARY MEASURES 
IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS CRIME.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C) AS WE NOTED IN REFTEL, CROATIA IS ANXIOUSLY 
WATCHING THE RESULTS OF UNPROFOR\'S FIRST OPERATIONAL 
SECTOR.  AFTER THE WEEKEND SHELLING OF OSIJEK, THE 
DECISION TO EXTEND THE JNA\'S TIMETABLE FOR WITHDRAWAL 
AND THE ALLEGED SERBIAN EXPULSION OF CIVILIANS FROM 
MIKLUSEVCI HAS FURTHER DEGRADED RESPECT FOR 
UNPROFOR\'S CAPABILITIES IN THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT, 
ARMY AND AMONG THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE.  WHILE 
CROATIAN EXPECTATIONS MAY BE TOO HIGH, THEIR 
PERCEPTIONS OF UNPROFOR FAIRNESS AND ABILITY TO DO 
THE JOB WILL BE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS IN THE REMAINING 
SECTORS DUE TO COME UNDER UN CONTROL.  END COMMENT.

CROAT/SERB GORSKI KOTAR REGION PROVIDED BOTH A 
HOPEFUL AND NEGATIVE PICTURE OF FUTURE RELATIONS 
BETWEEN SERBS AND CROATS IN CROATIA.  DIFFERING 
WARTIME EXPERIENCES IN VRBOVSKO AND OGULIN, ONLY 30 
KM APART, HAVE COLORED SERB/CROAT RELATIONSHIPS IN 
THE TWO DISTRICTS FOR YEARS TO COME.  IN VRBOVSKO, 
WHILE TENSIONS WERE HIGH, ACTUAL FIGHTING NEVER TOOK 
PLACE, AND WITH THE OVERALL CONFLICT ENDING IN 
CROATIA, INTERETHNIC RELATIONS SEEM TO BE TAKING A 
TURN FOR THE BETTER.  IN OGULIN, WHERE SERBS FLED AND 
WHERE THE FRONT LINE IS ONLY 15 KM AWAY, SITTING DOWN 
AT THE SAME TABLE TOGETHER IS STILL A MAJOR TASK FOR 
THE AREA\'S CROATS AND SERBS.  THE VILLAGE OF JASENAK, 
A PREDOMINANTLY SERB VILLAGE IN THE OGULIN DISTRICT, 
IS THE SITE OF A CONTROVERSIAL DISPLACED PERSON 
CENTER.  BOTH THE EC AND THE UNHCR ARE ACTIVELY 
ENGAGED THERE TO SEE THAT THE SENSITIVITIES OF ALL 
SIDES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  THE EC AND UNHCR WILL 
NOT BE HERE FOREVER, HOWEVER, AND THE PROCESS OF 
RECONCILIATION WILL BE DIFFICULT AT BEST.  IN SOME 
SITUATIONS, UNFORTUNATELY, RECONCILIATION SEEMS A 
DISTANT DREAM IF NOT AN IMPOSSIBILITY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN RESPONSE TO ALLEGATIONS REGARDING THE 
TREATMENT OF SERBS IN THE GORSKI KOTAR REGION OF 
CROATIA, WE VISITED TWO DISTRICTS (VRBOVSKO AND 
OGULIN) IN THE AREA ON JUNE 3.  DISCUSSIONS WITH 
SERBS AND CROATS REVEALED A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE IN 
INTER-ETHNIC RELATIONSHIPS IN THE NEIGHBORING 
DISTRICTS.  VRBOVSKO AND OGULIN ARE LOCATED IN THE 
HEART OF THE MOUNTAINOUS GORSKI KOTAR REGION,

VRBOVSKO:  A MODUS VIVENDI 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  SITTING DOWN WITH SERB AND CROAT REPRESENTATIVES 
IN VRBOVSKO PROVIDED SOME HOPE THAT ALL WAS NOT 
LOST.  AS WE DISCUSSED ISSUE AFTER THORNY ISSUE THAT 
HAVE PLAGUED SERB/CROAT RELATIONS IN THE FORMER 
YUGOSLAVIA, IT APPEARED TO US THAT THE TWO SERBS AND 
THREE CROATS MEETING WITH US HAD BEEN OVER THIS 
GROUND BEFORE.  THE WARTIME EXPERIENCE IN THE 
VRBOVSKO AREA WAS, WHILE NOT WITHOUT TENSION, LARGELY 
DEVOID OF ANY CONFLICT.  THERE WAS NEVER A JNA BASE 
IN THE DISTRICT, OFTEN THE FOCUS OF INITIAL FIGHTING 
IN OTHER PARTS OF CROATIA, SERB VILLAGERS NEVER SET 
UP BARRICADES, AND THE FRONT LINE WAS FAR ENOUGH AWAY 
TO KEEP THE DISTRICT FROM RECEIVING ANY SHELLING. 
THIS COMBINATION OF FACTORS CONSPIRED TO ALLOW 
REASONABLE SERBS AND CROATS TO PREVAIL IN VRBOVSKO. 
- 
5.  TWO OTHER FACTORS WORKED TO HOLD THE AREA 
TOGETHER.  ONE WAS POLITICAL AFFILIATION.  OF THE 
FOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WE MET WITH (2 SERBS 
AND 2 CROATS), TWO (ONE EACH) WERE MEMBERS OF THE 
PARTY FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGES (SDP - FORMER 
COMMUNISTS), ONE SERB JOINED THE SERBIAN DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY (SDS) FOLLOWING THE APRIL 1990 ELECTIONS, AND 
THE OTHER CROAT WAS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PARTY. 
PRESIDENT TUDJMAN\'S RULING CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION 
(HDZ) WAS NOT REPRESENTED IN THIS GROUP.  IN 
ADDITION, THOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THIS WAS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

6.  THE SECOND REASON IS THAT SERBS AND CROATS DID 
NOT FLEE THE VRBOVSKO DISTRICT AS THEY DID IN 
OTHERS.  BOTH GROUPS STUCK IT OUT THROUGH THE 
DIFFICULTIES AND NOW BOTH SIDES ASSERT THAT A CERTAIN 
NORMALIZATION IS RETURNING TO THE SERB-CROAT

RELATIONSHIP THERE.  IN THE DISTRICT AS A WHOLE, THE 
POPULATION BREAKDOWN IS ABOUT 65 PERCENT CROAT, 35 
PERCENT SERB.  NATURALLY, SOME VILLAGES ARE 100 
PERCENT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AS IS THE CASE FOR 
GOMIRJE AND SRPSKE MORAVICE (BOTH NEARLY 100 PERCENT 
SERB). 
 
VRBOVSKO:  NOT WITHOUT ITS PROBLEMS 
----------------------------------- 
 
7.  BOTH SIDES ADMITTED TO SERIOUS STRAINS IN THE 
RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY BLAMED ON SMALL GROUPS OF 
CROATIAN AND SERBIAN \"EXTREMISTS\".  \"EVERYONE IS 
ARMED,\" SAID LEADERS OF BOTH COMMUNITIES, LEADING TO 
THE PROMISE OF MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION IN CASE 
OF ANY BREAKDOWN IN THE CURRENT PEACE.  SOME OF THE 
CAUSES OF INSTABILITY IN THE DISTRICT OVER THE LAST 
10 MONTHS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 
- 
--  IN VRBOVSKO, PRIOR TO THE WAR, THERE WERE 18 
POLICEMEN, HALF OF WHOM WERE SERBS.  SINCE THE WAR, 
THE TOTAL NUMBER HAS INCREASED TO 62, TEN PERCENT OF 
WHOM ARE SERBS.  WHILE SERBS HAVE NOT BEEN FIRED FROM 
THE POLICE FORCE, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN HIRED EITHER, 
CONTRARY TO A NATIONAL REGULATION WHICH REQUIRES 
DISTRICTS TO HIRE BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF THE 
POPULATION WHICH IDENTIFIES ITSELF WITH DIFFERENT 
ETHNIC GROUPS. 
 
--  SERB LEADERS IN VRBOVSKO CONFIRMED THAT SERBS 
EMPLOYED BY THE CROATIAN RAILROAD FROM THAT AREA HAD

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00954  03 OF 08  111237Z

DISTRICT ABOUT 65 PERCENT CROAT AND 35 PERCENT SERB), 
A CITY UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE TO THE FRONT LINES THAT 
HAS HAD AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WAR EXPERIENCE.  IN A 
SPACE OF LESS THAN 30 KILOMETERS, WE HAD GONE FROM A 
POTENTIAL MODEL OF POST-WAR SERB/CROAT RELATIONS TO 
AN AREA THAT EXHIBITS ALL THE REASONS WHY SERBS AND 
CROATS IN THESE REGIONS MAY NEVER AGAIN TURN THEIR 
BACKS ON ONE ANOTHER.  THE MEETING, A TIGHTLY WOUND 
AFFAIR, INCLUDED DISPLACED PERSONS FROM A DESTROYED, 
KRAJINA-CONTROLLED, ONCE PREDOMINANTLY CROAT TOWN, 
OGULIN DISTRICT OFFICIALS, AND \"LOYAL\" SERB 
CITIZENS.  THE TENSION BETWEEN SERBS AND CROATS IN 
THIS MEETING (14 PARTICIPANTS) IN THE OGULIN DISTRICT 
HALL WAS PALPABLE. 
- 
10.  A LOT OF THE TENSION COMES FROM OGULIN\'S 
WAR-TIME EXPERIENCE.  A JNA BARRACKS WAS LOCATED IN 
THE CENTER OF THE CITY OF OGULIN, NEXT DOOR TO THE 
DISTRICT HALL.  CONSIDERABLE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE IN 
THE CITY BEFORE THE JNA ABANDONED THE SITE.  IN 
ADDITION, THE CITY IS LOCATED ONLY 15 KM FROM THE 
FRONT LINE AND SOME OF THE OGULIN DISTRICT REMAINS 
UNDER THE CONTROL OF KRAJINA FORCES (BUT OUTSIDE THE 
UNPAS, AS LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE QUICK TO POINT OUT). 
ADDITIONALLY, THOUGH THERE ARE NO CONCRETE FIGURES, 
MANY SERBS LEFT OGULIN BEFORE AND DURING THE WAR, 
LEAVING A BAD TASTE AMONG MANY CROATS WHO BELIEVE 
THAT THEY ALL LEFT TO FIGHT FOR THE \"CHETNIKS\" 
AGAINST THEIR OLD NEIGHBORS.  SABORSKO (THE CROATIAN

ITSELF IN PRACTICE.  SOME EXAMPLES: 
 
--  BEFORE THE WAR, IN OGULIN, ACCORDING TO THE 
DISTRICT PRESIDENT (A MEMBER OF THE RULING CROATIAN 
DEMOCRATIC UNION, CDU), 75 PERCENT OF THE POLICE 
FORCE WAS MADE UP OF SERBS.  NOW THAT FIGURE HAS BEEN 
REVERSED IN FAVOR OF CROATS.  WERE SERBS FIRED?  NO, 
SAY CROATS.  SERBS IN THE POLICE LEFT OGULIN; THE 
TOTAL NUMBER OF POLICE WAS INCREASED; ALL FIVE POLICE 
INSPECTORS ARE SERBS WHO HAVE BEEN KEPT ON IN ORDER 
TO \"USE\" THEIR KNOWLEDGE. 
(COMMENT:  WE ARE NOT IMPRESSED BY CLAIMS THAT NOONE 
WAS FIRED IN OGULIN BASED ON NATIONALITY.  THE 
REPORTS FROM VRBOVSKO AND ELSEWHERE SAY OTHERWISE. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
--  ACCORDING TO A SERB MEMBER OF THE CROATIAN 
ASSEMBLY, EMPTY HOUSES, KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED 
BY SERBS HAVE BEEN THE TARGETS OF BOMB ATTACKS. 
NOONE PRESENT DENIED THE CLAIM.  HOWEVER, SYMBOLIC OF 
THE DIPLOMATIC LANGUAGE THAT SERBS IN THE ROOM FELT 
COMPELLED TO USE, THE SERB ASSEMBLYMAN SAID THAT 
THESE WERE \"CONSEQUENCES OF A PROCESS I UNDERSTAND.\" 
HE WAS REFERRING, AS DID OTHER SERBS, TO THE 
EGREGIOUS ACTS OF FELLOW SERBS AROUND OGULIN, THE 
KRAJINA AND IN THE REST OF CROATIA. 
 
--  THE SAME ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED THE KILLING OF 10 
PEOPLE (PRESUMABLY SERBS) IN THE OGULIN PRISON. 
(COMMENT:  IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS ACT IS 
CURRENTLY BEING PROSECUTED BY CROATIAN AUTHORITIES.

ACCORDING TO THE OGULIN DISTRICT CHIEF, THERE ARE 
CURRENTLY 200 DISPLACED PEOPLE HOUSED NEAR JASENAK (A 
VILLAGE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE) IN AN UNUSED 
RESORT THAT HAS 1600 AVAILABLE BEDS.  THE SERB MEMBER 
OF THE CROATIAN ASSEMBLY TOLD US THAT THERE HAD BEEN 
LENGTHY PREPARATIONS BEFORE THE DISPLACED PERSONS HAD 
BEEN BROUGHT TO JASENAK.  DISCUSSIONS HAD BEEN HELD 
WITH THE DISPLACED AND THE VILLAGERS SEPARATELY IN 
ORDER TO PREPARE THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE 
DISPLACED.  IN ADDITION, BOTH THE EC MONITORING 
MISSION, WITH REPS HOUSED IN THE AREA, AND THE UNHCR 
ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN MAKING THE JASENAK SITUATION 
WORK.  FRESH FROM A JUNE 5 VISIT TO JASENAK, UNHCR 
CROATIA HEAD JEAN-CLAUDE CONCOLATO TOLD US JUNE 9 
THAT THERE WERE ONLY 38 DISPLACED STAYING NEAR 
JASENAK.  ALL OF THEM WERE OF RUTHENIAN NATIONALITY. 
FOR NOW, THE SITUATION IS UNDER NEW CONTROL AND NO 
NEW, IMMEDIATE INFLOWS OF DISPLACED ARE PLANNED. 
 
COMMENT

13.  THE EXPERIENCE OF VRBOVSKO SUGGESTS THAT IN 
THESE AREAS OF CROATIA WHERE FIGHTING OR EXPULSIONS 
DID NOT TAKE PLACE, THERE IS SOME HOPE OF 
RECONCILIATION.  UNFORTUNATELY, A FAVORABLE LOCAL 
CLIMATE CAN BE SPOILED BY OUTSIDE ACTIONS (E.G. 
DISMISSALS MADE BY ORGANIZATIONS BASED OUTSIDE THE 
AREA OR MEDIA HYPE FROM ZAGREB THAT INACCURATELY 
DESCRIBES A PARTICULAR SITUATION).  ELSEWHERE, WHERE

14.  IT IS OUR VIEW THAT EVEN IN AREAS WHERE SOME 
EFFORTS TOWARD RECONCILIATION ARE UNDER WAY, ANY REAL 
SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE OVERALL CLIMATE AS DEFINED BY 
ZAGREB.  PROGRESS IN INTER-ETHNIC RELATIONS HAS BEEN 
TENUOUS AT BEST IN A FEW AREAS, WHILE IN MOST AREAS 
NO SUCH EFFORTS HAVE GOTTEN UNDER WAY, NOR WILL THEY 
UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER AND THE UNPROFOR HAS DONE ITS 
JOB.  SUCCESS IN REINTEGRATING SERBS INTO CROATIA 
WILL COME ONLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH A POSITIVE 
ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF THE REPUBLIC LEADERSHIP.  WE 
BELIEVE LITTLE IMPROVEMENT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT CLEAR

TREBINJE AND CROATIAN FORCES IN BOSNIA.

1.  THE JULY 12, 1992 EDITION OF THE ZAGREB DAILY
\"VJESNIK\" RAN THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE ON THE DUBROVNIK
FRONT.  IT POINTS OUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF THIS BATTLE
GROUND MAKING IT CLEAR THAT IT IS UP TO BOSNIAN

VIEW OF DUBROVNIK AND ITS SURROUNDINGS FROM THE
ENEMIES\' BASES.
TO PREVLAKA ACROSS TREBINJE.
THE CROATIAN ARMY CANNOT CROSS THE TERRITORY OF
BOSNIA AND HERCEGOVINA FROM WHERE VUCUREVIC\'S CANNONS
ARE DESTROYING DUBROVNIK.  HOW TO CUT THE DUBROVNIK
KNOT?

WITHOUT THE COMPLETE MILITARY DEFEAT OF THE ILL-FAMED
SAO-PRESIDENT, TRUCK DRIVER BOZIDAR VUCUREVIC, THE
ENDING OF THE BESTIAL DESTRUCTION OF DUBROVNIK IS OUT
OF THE QUESTION, EVEN LESS THE LIBERATION OF KONAVLI
IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE DUBROVNIK COMMUNITY WHICH
IS UNDER JNA OCCUPATION.  THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY
THE NEWEST ATTACK, WHEN VUCUREVIC\'S ARTILLERY OF THE

\"HERCEGOVIAN CORPS\" FROM THE DIRECTION OF TREBINJE,
TOGETHER WITH THE JNA MARITIME SECTOR FOR BOKA
KOTORSKA, FROM OCCUPIED CILIPI, HAVE DESTROYED
DUBROVNIK.

UNINFORMED PERSONS IMPOSE THE QUESTION WHY THE
CROATIAN ARMY DOES NOT STEP FORWARD ON THE TERRITORY
OF THE NEIGHBORING STATE AND WITH A VIOLENT
COUNTER-ATTACK REPULSE THE ENEMY FURTHER FROM THE
CROATIAN BORDER.  SINCE THE OCCUPYING FORCES HAVE
SUFFERED HEAVY DEFEAT IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE
DUBROVNIK COMMUNITY AND HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM STRATEGIC
POSITIONS NEAR DUBROVNIK, FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HAVE
BEEN CREATED FOR SUCH A RETALIATION.

ON THE OTHER HAND, CROATIA HAS RECOGNIZED B-H AS A
SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT STATE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT
CANNOT DIRECT ITS ARMY ON THAT TERRITORY IN SPITE OF
THE FACT THAT DUBROVNIK IS CONSTANTLY THREATENED FROM
THIS TERRITORY.  SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO, WHICH DID NOT
RECOGNIZE B-H, WOULD BARELY WAIT TO INFORM THE WORLD
ABOUT CROATIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAR ON THE B-H
TERRITORY.  HOW LONG WILL THIS UNBEARABLE SITUATION
FOR THE CITIZENS OF DUBROVNIK LAST AND HOW TO CUT THE
\"DUBROVNIK KNOT\"?

ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT MILITARY-STRATEGIC
SITUATION, THE CROATIAN ARMY CANNOT WITHOUT A GREAT
RISK UNDERTAKE THE LIBERATION OF KONAVLI.
VUCUREVIC\'S CHETNIKS HAVE STRONG FORTIFICATIONS IN
THE VICINITY OF DUBROVNIK AND THEY CAN ATTACK THE

CANNON FIRE HAS BEEN OPENED AT DUBROVNIK\'S SUBURBS 
MOKOSICA AND OTHER PLACES OF THE RIJEKA DUBROVACKA. 
CHETNIKS HAVE FORTIFIED THEMSELVES ON IVANICA AND 
USKOPOLJE, LOCATED AT THE STATE BORDER.  THE LITTORAL 
BELT AT THE EXTREME SOUTH PART OF CROATIA IS VERY 
NARROW AND THE AREA BETWEEN SREBRENO AND MLINI IS NOT 
EVEN THREE KILOMETERS FROM THE COAST TO THE              . 
INTERSTATE BORDER.  AN ATTEMPT BY TREBINJE CHETNIKS 
TO BREAKTHROUGH ACROSS IVANICA COULD BE EASILY 
REPELLED BY THE CROATIAN FORCES WITH THE OPENING OF 
FIRE FROM BRGAT, ZARKOVICA AND DUBAC.  BREAKTHROUGHS 
CAN BE ALSO EXPECTED ACROSS THE VISOCNIK SADDLE, 
LOWER SLOPES OF SNJEZNICA AND THE JAVOR PASS. 
 
STILL THERE IS AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION FOR THE 
NEUTRALIZATION OF THE PRESSURE FROM TREBINJE.  HVO 
(CROATIAN DEFENSE COUNCIL) FIGHTERS, WHO WITH THEIR 
BREAKTHROUGH TO NEUM HAVE PRACTICALLY LIBERATED THE 
WHOLE TERRITORY OF THE BOSNIAN-HERCEGOVIAN COMMUNITY 
RAVNO, SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THAT THEIR FINAL GOAL HAS 
BEEN ACHIEVED.  THE TREBINJE TRUCK DRIVER WILL NOT BE 
EASILY RECONCILED WITH THE LOSS OF ONE PART OF HIS 
PLANNED DUKEDOM AND THEREFORE HE WILL CONTINUE TO 
ATTACK RAVNO.  THE ONLY WAY TO GIVE A DESERVED

CONTINUATION OF A BREAKTHROUGH UNDERTAKEN BY THE HVO

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  THE OSIJEK MAYOR THREATENED TO RESIGN IF THE 
MILITARY DOES NOT POLICE UP LAWLESS ELEMENTS WITHIN 
ITS RANKS.  THE MOD AGAIN DENIED THAT CROATIAN UNITS 
ARE FIGHTING IN BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA.  VP MESIC CALLED

PARTIES.  THE PAKRAC COUNTY GOVERNMENT HAS RETURNED 
TO ITS SEAT AFTER A NINE MONTH EXILE.  DUBROVNIK AND 
SURROUNDING REGIONS WERE SHELLED OVER THE WEEKEND. 
SLOVENIAN RTV DIRECTOR RESIGNED AFTER COMPLAINING OF 
POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
OSIJEK MAYOR KRAMARIC THREATENS RESIGNATION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  THE YOUNG AND DYNAMIC MAYOR OF THE EMBATTLED 
CROATIAN TOWN OF OSIJEK, ZLATKO KRAMARIC, COMPLAINED 
TO A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THE LOCAL MILITARY POLICE 
ARE FAILING TO CRACK DOWN ON CRIMINAL ELEMENTS WHO 
HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE ARMY.  HE CITED A 
RECENT CAR BOMBING WHICH KILLED A YOUNG CROAT MAN AS 
THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE OF A GROWING LAWLESS TREND IN 
THE TOWN.  HE SAID THAT IF THE MILITARY POLICE WILL 
NOT PREVENT CRIMES CARRIED OUT BY ARMED RENEGADES 
DRESSED IN UNIFORMS, HE WILL BE OBLIGED TO SUBMIT HIS 
RESIGNATION.  KRAMARIC HAD ASKED SEVERAL TIMES THAT 
THE MILITARY POLICE AND MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR, SO 
FAR WITHOUT RESULT, GET RID OF THOSE CRIMINALS WHO 
ARE BURNING HOUSES, SHOPS, AND CARS.  ACCORDING TO 
THE MAYOR, THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO ENOUGH TO 
PREVENT THE RECRUITMENT OF PEOPLE WITH AN UNSAVORY 
BACKGROUND, AND THESE PERSONS NOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THEIR UNIFORMS AND WEAPONS TO CARRY OUT CRIMINAL 
ACTS.

WOLTMANN TOLD SIBENIK RESIDENTS THAT THE VANCE PLAN 
AMENDMENTS WILL BE BENEFICIAL.  THE MOD HAS PROTESTED 
RENEWED ATTACKS ON CROATIA, SOME OF WHICH ARE COMING 
FROM UN-CONTROLLED AREAS.  LATEST OFFICIAL CROATIAN 
CASUALTIES INCLUDE 1,773 CIVILIANS AND 1,389 SOLDIERS 
KILLED AND 20,127 PERSONS INJURED.  TUDJMAN IS 
EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE NEW ELECTIONS FOR AUGUST 2.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
GOVERNMENT CALLS FOR FOREIGN MILITARY HELP 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  CROATIA ISSUED ANOTHER PROTEST JUNE 22 AGAINST 
THE NEW SERB/JNA ATTACKS ON DUBROVNIK WHICH CAUSED 
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO HISTORICAL BUILDINGS IN THE OLD 
TOWN.  THE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNED THE INTENSIFIED 
SHELLING OF SIBENIK, ZADAR, SLAVONSKI BROD AND THE 
REGION OF POSAVINA, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUOUS ATTACKS 
ON SARAJEVO.  THE GOVERNMENT MADE AN APPEAL TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR A COLLECTIVE, EFFICIENT 
\"MILITARY INTERVENTION,\" BECAUSE THE PRESENT 
MEASURES, CONDEMNATIONS AND SANCTIONS HAVE PROVED 
INADEQUATE.  ITS APPEAL WAS MOTIVATED BY THE 
CONTINUING ACCUMULATION OF \"VICTIMS, FAMINE, SHORTAGE 
OF WATER, ELECTRICITY AND MEDICINES.\"  THE GOVERNMENT 
STATEMENT STRESSED \"THE AGONY OF THE CITIZENS OF 
DUBROVNIK CAUSED BY THE PROLONGED SIEGE, ISOLATION, 
AND CONTINUOUS EXPOSURE TO SHELLING AND SHOOTING.\"

EC REPRESENTATIVE WOLTMANN DISCUSSED \"PINK ZONE\" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4.  EC REPRESENTATIVE DIETER WOLTMANN TOLD SIBENIK 
COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES JUNE 23 THAT UNPROFOR WILL 
TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY OVER SECTOR SOUTH BY JUNE 
25, IF BOTH SIDES -- CROATIAN AND JNA AUTHORITIES -- 
AGREE WITH AMENDMENTS TO THE VANCE PLAN WORKED OUT BY 
GENERAL NAMBIAR.  THESE AMENDMENTS FORESEE WITHDRAWAL 
OF CANNONS TO 30 KMS FROM THE COUNTIES\' BORDERS 
(UNDER THE CONTROL OF UNPROFOR), OF TANKS AND OTHER 
HEAVY ARMAMENT TO 10 KMS, AND FOR INFANTRY TO 5 KMS. 
THIS \"TERRITORY\" WOULD REPRESENT A \"DEMARCATION LINE\" 
OF UNPROFOR CONTROL.  THE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PLAN 
DOES NOT UNDERCUT CROATIAN AUTHORITY, ACCORDING TO 
WOLTMANN.  HE ALSO SUGGESTED A CROATIAN \"AMNESTY\" FOR 
THOSE RESIDENTS IN THE CONTESTED AREAS NOT INVOLVED 
IN WAR CRIMES. 
 
CROATIAN MOD PROTESTS DUBROVNIK AND \"EAST\" ATTACKS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5.  THE CROATIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE ISSUED A PUBLIC 
PROTEST JUNE 23, OF VIOLATION OF THE SARAJEVO 
AGREEMENT BY SERB/JNA FORCES.  IT ASKED UNPROFOR AND 
THE EC TO APPLY ALL POSSIBLE MEANS TO STOP CEASE-FIRE 
VIOLATIONS ON OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  THE PROTEST 
CITED HEAVY CANNON ATTACKS ON SIBENIK, ZUPANJA, SISAK 
AND SUNJA, AS WELL AS DUBROVNIK.  INFANTRY FIRE WAS 
OPENED ON CROATIAN ARMY POSITIONS NEAR OSIJEK FROM 
SERB BASES IN SECTOR EAST, AN AREA NOW OSTENSIBLY

TUDJMAN\'S \"LE FIGARO\" INTERVIEW 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  PRESIDENT FRANJO TUDJMAN TOLD THE PARIS \"LE 
FIGARO\" THAT \"IF WAR CONTINUES IN BOSNIA AND 
HERCEGOVINA, CROATIA WILL HAVE TO INTERVENE.\" 
ACCORDING TO TUDJMAN, CROATIA IS FOR A PEACEFUL 
SOLUTION IF THIS IS POSSIBLE.  IN CASE A MILITARY 
INTERVENTION WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RESTORE THE PEACE, 
THE PRESIDENT IS FOR MORE EFFICACIOUS MEASURES SUCH 
AS AN AIR AND NAVAL BLOCKADE BY ALLIED AND/OR NATO 
FORCES.  THE MAIN PART OF TUDJMAN\'S INTERVIEW WAS 
DEDICATED TO CROATIAN-BOSNIAN RELATIONS.  HE STRESSED 
AGAIN THAT NO MILITARY PACT HAS BEEN SIGNED BETWEEN 
CROATIA AND BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA.  HE POINTED OUT THAT 
THE GOAL OF CROATS AND MUSLIMS IS TO ESTABLISH 
MILITARY COOPERATION WHICH WOULD ENABLE THEM TO 
DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM AGGRESSION IN B-H.  IF CROATS 
IN NEIGHBORING B-H WOULD BE THREATENED WITH 
ANNIHILATION, CROATIA WILL BE OBLIGED \"TO DO 
SOMETHING TO HELP THEM.\"  TUDJMAN ASSERTED THAT AT 
THE MOMENT NO REGULAR CROATIAN ARMY IS FIGHTING IN 
B-H.  (EMBASSY PARIS HAS PROVIDED A FULLER VERSION OF 
THIS INTERVIEW IN REFTEL.)

IMPROVE, I AM COMPELLED TO SEND OUT THIS DRAMATIC

IN SPITE OF ALL EFFORTS MADE BY THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY, THE SECURITY COUNCIL\'S RESOLUTION, THE 
HELSINKI DECISIONS, UNPROFOR MISSION, THE 
SITUATION IN BOSIA-HERCEGOVINA HAS TAKEN A 
DRAMATIC TURN FOR WORSE. 
 
THE SERBIAN AGGRESSORS HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR 
ATTACKS AT ALL POSITIONS OF ALREADY EXISTING 
CONFRONTATION (SARAJEVO, BOSNIAN POSAVINA, MOSTAR, 
DUBROVNIK, SLAVONSKI BROD, ZUPANJA...) AND OPENED

AGGRESSORS ARE INTENT ON ACHIEVING TWO BASIC 
OBJECTIVES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THROUGH A 
LARGE-SCALE MILITARY OPERATION: 
 
1)  ROUNDING UP THE BORDERS OF THE SO-CALLED 
GREATER SERBIAN THROUGH DESTRUCTION OF ALL MOSLEM 
AND CROATIAN ENTITIES IN CONTACT ZONES; 
 
2)  ACCOMPLISHING COMPLETE ETHNIC CLEANSING OF 
TERRITORIES WITHIN THE SO-CALLED SERBIAN KRAINAS. 
 
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE SECOND OBJECTIVE, THEY ARE 
COMMITTING CRIMES UNHEARD-OF SINCE THE HOLOCAUST 
AND THE END OF THE WORLD WAR II.  ON A MASSIVE 
SCALE MOSLEMS AND CROATS ARE BEING EXECUTED AND 
HERDED INTO PRISON CAMPS, ENTIRE PLACES RAZED TO 
THE GROUND, EVEN GRAVEYARD DESTROYED (E.G. THE 
AREA OF PRIJEDOR-KOZARAC).  THE PURPOSE OF ALL 
THIS IS OBVIOUS:  TO DRIVE OUT THE NON-SERBIAN 
POPULATION FROM THESE AREAS FOR GOOD. 
 
THE SITUATION IS PARTICULARLY DRAMATIC IN THE 
AREAS OF NORTHERN BOSIA (POSAVINA) WHERE THE 
SERBIAN ATROCITIES HAVE FORCED THE MAJORITY MOSLEM 
POPULATION THERE INTO A PANIC FLIGHT TO CROATIA. 
 
ONLY TODAY MORE THAN 20,000 PEOPLE HAVE FLED 
ACROSS THE RIVER SAVA TO CROATIA TO SEEK SHELTER 
IN THE AREA BETWEEN SLAVONSKI BROD AND ZUPANJA. 
AS THE SAVA BRIDGES ARE DEMOLISHED, PEOPLE ARE 
USING ALL KINDS OF MEANS TO RUN TO SAFETY AND MANY

THE AFORESAID IS AN ELEVENTH-HOUR WARNING THAT 
UNLESS AN INTERNATIONAL MILITARY INTERVENTION IS 
UNDERTAKEN SHORTLY, THE CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF

IMMEASURABLE. 
CROATIA IS DOING ITS UTMOST TO GIVE EVERY POSSIBLE 
HELP TO THIS VAST NUMBER OF EXPELLED PEOPLE, BUT 
UTTERLY EXHAUSTED AS IT IS AS A RESULT OF THE WAR 
AND THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES IN NEED 
OF ACCOMMODATION, CLOTHES AND FOOD, IT HAS FOUND 
ITSELF IN A POSITION WHERE IT WILL BE FORCED TO 
REDIRECT THE FLOW OF REFUGEES TOWARDS WESTERN 
EUROPE. 
 
THEREFORE, I APPEAL TO YOU TO DO ALL YOU CAN TO 
PREVENT THE TRAGEDY WHICH IS LOOMING LARGER AND 
LARGER EVERY MINUTE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY 
THING LEFT IS TO CALL AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL AND TO APPROVE AN INTERNATIONAL 
MILITARY ACTION.

REF:  STATE 237028 
 
1. THIS REPORT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF, DAILY 
UPDATE ON THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE SITUATION IN 
THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA WITH REGARD TO CONVOYS, 
COORDINATION, DISTRIBUTION OF U.S.-DONATED 
ASSISTANCE, AND OTHER RELATED SUBJECTS.

-------------- 
 
2.  THE SARAJEVO AIRLIFT IS ON AGAIN WITH 26 PLANES 
SCHEDULED TO FLY TODAY.  UNPROFOR REPORTS THAT BOTH 
THEY AND UNHCR WERE READY TO RESUME FLYING YESTERDAY 
BUT APPARENTLY ALL THE PILOTS HAD BEEN GIVEN LEAVE 
AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO FLY THE PLANES.

3.  REGARDING THE INCIDENT THAT HALTED THE FLIGHTS, 
UNPROFOR REPORTS THAT GENERAL NAMBIAR FINDS THE 
EVIDENCE IMPLICATING SERB FORCES INCONCLUSIVE.  IN 
FACT, UNPROFOR CLAIMS THAT THE BRITISH PLANE SEEMS TO 
HAVE BEEN FLYING OVER CROAT/MUSLIM-CONTROLLED 
TERRITORY WHEN LOCKED-ON BY UNIDENTIFIED 
ANTI-AIRCRAFT RADAR.

JOINT COMMISSION UPDATE 
----------------------- 
 
4.  THE \"JOINT COMMISSION\" SET UP TO OVERSEE AND 
MONITOR THE PROCESS OF RESTORATION OF THE CRO?IAN 
GOVERNMENT\'S AUTHORITY IN THE \"PINK ZONES\" WILL 
ATTEMPT TO MEET TOMORROW (AUGUST 21).  THE COMMISSION 
FAILED TO HOLD ITS SECOND SESSION A WEEK AGO WHEN THE 
CROATS REFUSED TO MEET CERTAIN PRE-CONDITIONS 
DEMANDED BY THE SERBS.  UNPROFOR IS HOPEFUL THAT THE 
MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE THIS TIME. 
 
5.  THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS AGEED IN PRINCIPLE TO 
RETURN THE EXHUMED CORPSES OF SERBS WHO DIED FIGHTING 
IN THE AREA OF THE MILJEVICI PLATEAU.  THEY HAVE ALSO 
AGREED TO RELEASE A NUMBER OF PRISONERS HELD IN 
OSIJEK AND CONVICTED OF WAR CRIMES.  RUMOR HAS IT 
THAT A PARDON MAY ALSO BE FORTHCOMING FROM PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN\'S OFFICE. 
 
6.  THE SERBS IN TURN HAVE AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO LET 
A GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS INSPECT THE PERUCA 
DAM WITH A VIEW TO MAKING IT OPERATIONAL BEFORE THE

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  AS UN/EC PEACE ENVOYS VANCE AND OWEN MET WITH 
CROATIAN AUTHORITIES IN ZAGREB LAST FRIDAY, THE 
COUNTRY\'S PARLIAMENT ERUPTED INTO DEBATE OVER THE 
PASSAGE OF A LAW GRANTING AMNESTY TO SOME OF THOSE 
WHO FOUGHT FOR SERBIA AGAINST CROATIA.  A SECOND 
SESSION OF CROATIA\'S NEW NATIONAL DEFENSE COUNCIL 
APPROVED THE FORMATION OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO 
PROMOTE MILITARY COOPERATION WITH B-H.  LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS HAVE ORDERED THE FIRST GROUP OF REFUGEES 
TO LEAVE THEIR TEMPORARY RESIDENCES IN HOTELS AND 
RETURN TO THEIR HOMES IN THE PINK ZONE AROUND 
SIBENIK.  ETHNIC CLEANSING REPORTEDLY CONTINUES IN 
THE BARANJA AREA (SECTOR EAST).  DESPITE GOVERNMENT 
EFFORTS TO PRIVATIZE REMAINING PUBLIC-OWNED 
ENTERPRISES, FEWER THAN ONE-QUARTER HAVE BEEN SOLD 
THUS FAR.  A COURT-ORDERED SEARCH UNCOVERED LARGE 
AMOUNTS OF EXPLOSIVES AND ARMS AT THE DOWNTOWN 
ZAGREB PARTY HEADQUARTERS OF ULTRA-RIGHTIST LEADER 
PARAGA.  OVER THE WEEKEND, ALL LOCAL PAPERS GAVE 
WIDE COVERAGE TO THE LATEST U.S. ANNOUNCEMENTS OF 
ATROCITIES IN B-H. 
 
CROATIAN SABOR PASSES AMNESTY LAW 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.  DURING THE SECOND AND FINAL DAY OF ITS LATEST 
SESSION (ON SEPTEMBER 25), CROATIA\'S SABOR PASSED 
THE AMNESTY LAW PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT TUDJMAN AFTER 
SOME STORMY DEBATES.  THE LEGISLATION EXCUSES ALL 
THOSE WHO FOUGHT AGAINST CROATIA BUT DID NOT COMMIT 
WAR CRIMES.  THE LOCAL PRESS NOTED THAT THE ACTION 
WAS 
TIMED TO COINCIDE WITH THE VANCE-OWEN MEETINGS IN 
ZAGREB TO PROVE THAT CROATIA IS DOING ITS PART TO 
REESTABLISH PEACE IN CROATIA. 
 
3.  MOST OF THE OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE AGAINST THE 
MEASURE.  CROATIAN NATIONAL PARTY AND SOCIAL LIBERAL 
PARTY LEADERS CALLED THE LAW ONE-SIDED, AND

POSTPONING ENACTMENT OF THE LAW, SINCE SERBIAN 
FORCES CONTINUE DAILY BOMBARDMENTS OF CROATIAN

HELD ITS SECOND SESSION IN ZAGREB.  THE AGENDA 
INCLUDED THE TUDJMAN-IZETBEGOVIC ADDENDUM TO THE 
CROATIA/B-H FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION AGREEMENT AND

MUNICIPAL LEADERS ORDERED DISPLACED PERSONS (CROATS) 
FROM THE SKRADIN REGION AND THE DRNIS DISTRICT TO 
LEAVE HOTELS IN SIBENIK AND VODICE AND RETURN TO 
THEIR HOMES.  THIS IS THE FIRST GROUP SO AFFECTED.

8.  IN THE LAST 10 DAYS, 200 CROATS AND HUNGARIANS 
HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM BARANJA IN SECTOR EAST--MOST 
OF THEM FROM THE AREA BETWEEN BELI MANASTIR AND 
HUNGARY.  SERBIAN AUTHORITIES IN BARANJA HOPE THIS 
WILL PREVENT THE ANNOUNCED RETURN OF CROATIAN

9.  DURING LAST WEEK\'S SABOR SESSION, THE GOVERNMENT 
ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS PREPARING A LAW THAT WILL BREAK 
APART THE STATE-OWNED ENERGY MONOPOLY \"INA.\"  THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL KEEP MAJORITY CONTROL OVER THE 
EXPLOITATION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ALTHOUGH OTHER 
INVESTORS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO BUY SHARES. 
- 
10.  MEANWHILE, THE AGENCY FOR RESTRUCTURING AND 
DEVELOPMENT OF CROATIA HAS ISSUED 600 DECISIONS 
ABOUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF OTHER REMAINING 
GOVERNMENT-OWNED ENTERPRISES.  THE ENTIRE WORTH OF 
ALL THESE ENTERPRISES AMOUNTS TO 3.2 BILLION MARKS, 
AND THEY EMPLOY 49,527 WORKERS.  ABOUT HALF OF THE 
SHARES WERE BOUGHT BY WORKERS IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT 
FIRMS (THE CANDY ENTERPRISE \"KRAS\" AND THE SHIPYARD 
\"ULJANIK\" IN PULA).  PRIVATIZATION EFFORTS WILL 
CONTINUE BECAUSE FEWER THAN ONE-FOURTH OF ELIGIBLE 
FIRMS HAVE BEEN SOLD OFF THUS FAR.  TO ACCELERATE 
THE PROCESS, ENTERPRISES WILL ALSO BE OFFERED TO 
FOREIGN PURCHASERS-

SUBJECT:  HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA - REPORTED RAPES OF YOUNG MUSLIM WOMEN 
- 
1.  A TWO-PAGE ARTICLE IN THE SEPT 25 EDITION OF THE 
ZAGREB WEEKLY \"GLOBUS\" REPORTS THAT A GROUP OF FORTY 
YOUNG WOMEN FROM THE MUSLIM-POPULATED TOWN OF BREZOVO 
POLJE, NORTH OF SARAJEVO, WERE BRUTALIZED AND 
 
REPEATEDLY RAPED IN MAY OF THIS YEAR BY SERBIAN 
SOLDIERS.  THE WOMEN, NINE OF WHOM ARE SHOWN IN A 
GROUP PHOTOGRAPH WITH THEIR MOTHERS AND SEVERAL OF 
THE MOST HEAVILY QUOTED OF WHOM ARE SHOWN IN 
INDIVIDUAL PHOTOS, ARE NOW IN A DISPLACED PERSONS 
CAMP IN TUZLA.  THERE A \"GLOBUS\" JOURNALIST 
INTERVIEWED THEM, ALONG WITH DR. MELIKA KREITMAYER, 
IDENTIFIED AS THE HEAD OF A GROUP OF GYNECOLOGISTS 
SENT BY THE UN TO B-H TO INVESTIGATE REPORTED CASES 
OF \"BODILY ATTACKS\" ON THE PART OF SERBS. 
 
2.  THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE VIOLENCE DONE TO 
MIRSADA DIDOVIC (23 YEARS OF AGE), ALMIRA AJANOVIC 
(18), JASMINA FERIC (20), SEVLETA AJANOVIC (18), TWO

MINORS IDENTIFIED AS MEJRA (17) AND ZIBA (17), AND 
NUMEROUS OTHERS WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW THEIR NAMES TO BE 
REVEALED.  THE WOMEN INTERVIEWED GAVE SIMILAR 
ACCOUNTS OF HOW SERBIAN SOLDIERS HAD ENTERED THEIR 
TOWN IN MAY, FORCED THEIR WAY INTO MUSLIM HOMES, 
TAKEN THE MOST ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN FROM THEIR 
FAMILIES, AND JAILED THEM.  GROUPS OF SERBIAN 
SOLDIERS REPORTEDLY THEN RAPED THEM OVER A PERIOD OF 
SEVERAL DAYS.  ONE VICTIM, ALMIRA AJANOVIC, WAS 
REPORTEDLY GANG RAPED IN FRONT OF HER FATHER, WHO WAS 
HIMSELF GAGGED AND BOUND BY WIRE.  ANOTHER, JASMINA 
FERIC, REPORTEDLY WITNESSED THE SLITTING OF HER 
FATHER\'S THROAT AND THE SHOOTING OF HER MOTHER BEFORE 
SHE WAS GANG RAPED BY NINE SOLDIERS FOR THREE DAYS. 
 
- 
3.  THROUGH QUOTES FROM DR. KREITMAYER AND SEVERAL OF 
THE VICTIMS, WHO IN TURN QUOTED THEIR ATTACKERS, THE 
ARTICLE ARGUES THAT GROSS VIOLENCE AGAINST AND 
HUMILIATION OF MUSLIM WOMEN WAS NOT A HAPPENSTANCE OF 
WAR OR MERELY THE ISOLATED ACTS OF CRAZED SOLDIERS. 
RATHER, IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY PART OF A DELIBERATE SERBIAN 
STRATEGY TO SOW TERROR IN THE MUSLIM POPULATION. 
 
4.  DR. KREITMAYER IS REPORTED TO HAVE PHYSICALLY 
EXAMINED THE WOMEN, SOME OF WHOM HAD BECOME PREGNANT 
AND ABORTED.

MURDERS, ASSAULTS, VIOLENT HARASSMENT, DESTRUCTION OF 
CATHOLIC CHURCHES, AND ATTACKS ON MIXED MARRIAGES ARE 
NOW COMMONPLACE.  UNPROFOR REPS ARE WAGING AN UPHILL 
STRUGGLE TO BRING TO TASK SERBIAN PERPETRATORS -- WHO 
ARE INTEGRAL ELEMENTS OF THE SO-CALLED GOVERNMENT IN 
THE AREA.  THE ODDS ON UNPROFOR\'S SUCCEEDING ARE NOT 
GREAT, WHICH IS WHY THE SECTOR EAST SITUATION IS AMONG 
THE MOST OFT-CITED POTENTIAL CAUSES OF A FEARED LARGE- 
SCALE FLARE UP OF SERBO-CROATIAN FIGHTING NEXT SPRING.

INTERVIEWS BY TWO EMBASSY OFFICERS DURING TRAVEL TO 
SECTOR EAST OCTOBER 1-4 IN SUPPORT OF A CSCE

6.  IN THIS DISMAL SETTING, SERBIAN OFFICIALS ADD TO 
THE MISERY THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC PROGRAM OF ETHNIC 
CLEANSING AIMED AT DRIVING OUT ALL REMAINING CROATS, 
HUNGARIANS, SLOVAKS, AND OTHER MINORITIES.  ON AUGUST 
31, 1992, SOME TWENTY NON-SERBS (MOSTLY SLOVAKS) 
REPORTEDLY WERE DISMISSED FROM THE ILOK BRICK FACTORY

AND WERE HIRED AT THE BRICK FACTORY -- WHICH EMBOFFS 
OBSERVED OPERATING AT A BRISK PACE. 
 
7.  UNPROFOR CIVILIAN POLICE ALSO TOLD EMBOFFS THAT 
HUNGARIANS AND SLOVAKS ARE PRESSURED TO ACCEPT

TYPICAL CASE OBSERVED BY AN UNPROFOR CIVILIAN POLICE 
OFFICER, A SIXTY-TWO YEAR OLD CROATIAN WOMAN WAS 
ACCUSED OF HAVING A HANDGRENADE, GUN, AND SHOTGUN IN 
HER HOME.  IN A \"QUICKY\" TRIAL THE DEFENDANT WAS

ACCUSATIONS AGAINST EIGHT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD TRIED 
TO FORCE 23 NON-SERBS THEY WERE EXPELLING TO CROSS A

QUICKLY FREED.  ONE SERB REPORTEDLY WAS ARRESTED FOR 
THREE CONSECUTIVE MURDERS.  HE WAS RELEASED TWICE 
WITHOUT PUNISHMENT.  AFTER THE THIRD ARREST HE WAS 
TAKEN TO THE SERBIAN BORDER AND ALLOWED TO CROSS INTO 
VOJVODINA.  DURING THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER 7-8, A 
NON-SERB COUPLE WAS MURDERED IN THE UNPA.  THERE ARE 
NO SUSPECTS.  ON OCTOBER 1, TWO MUSLIMS WERE MURDERED 
IN THE UNPA.  THERE ARE NO SUSPECTS.  MILAN ILICH, 
\"PRESIDENT\" OF THE VUKOVAR REGION EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, 
WAS ASKED IN OCTOBER WHY NO ACTION HAD BEEN TAKEN 
AGAINST KNOWN TERRORISTS.  HE REPORTEDLY RESPONDED

13.  UNPROFOR REPORTEDLY INFORMED ILICH OF AN 
ESPECIALLY EGREGIOUS TERRORIZATION OF A NUMBER OF 
ELDERLY NON-SERB WOMEN WHO WERE FINALLY DRIVEN OUT OF 
THEIR HOMES IN SEPTEMBER.  AFTER A DELAY, DURING 
WHICH HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INVESTIGATING THE CASE,

\"THOSE PEOPLE (SERBS) WHO HAVE LOST EVERYTHING ON THE

OFTEN CAUSE \"DIFFICULTIES,\" HE CLAIMED.

16.  MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED \"SPECIAL POLICE\" ARE 
ALSO BELIEVED TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN CRIMES 
AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THESE FORCES ARE A 
SUBTERFUGE DESIGNED TO AVOID THE LIMITS IN THE VANCE

ON THE JNA AND THEIR REMOVAL ORDERED, THEY BECAME

17.  ACCORDING TO UN ESTIMATES, THE NUMBER OF SERBIAN 
POLICE JUMPED FROM 150 TO 800 DURING THE TRANSITION 
PERIOD AT THE SETTING UP OF THE UNPA.  A \"SPECIAL

SUBJECT:  CGY001:  UNPROFOR\'S DAUNTING TASK IN CROATIA 
-         -- ANOTHER GRIM REPORT FROM SECTOR EAST 
 
26.  UNPROFOR OFFICIALS HAVE ASKED SERBIAN AUTHORITIES 
TO EXCAVATE THE SUSPECTED GRAVES, BUT THEY HAVE DONE 
NOTHING.  IN RESPONSE TO DIRECT QUESTIONS FROM THE 
CSCE DELEGATION ABOUT THE HARASSMENT, MURDER, AND 
INTIMIDATION OF NON-SERBS IN VUKOVAR, \"PRESIDENT\" 
ILICH SAID \"WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE ABOUT THESE THINGS.\"

27.  THE SERBIAN LEADERSHIP IN VUKOVAR, LIKE THEIR 
COUNTERPARTS IN KNIN, HAVE MADE FOR THEMSELVES A 
HOBBESIAN WORLD OF THE DARKEST DIMENSIONS.  THE 
SAVAGERY THEY HAVE UNLEASHED AND NOW AID AND ABET HAS 
MADE LIFE A VIRTUAL HELL FOR ALL THE NON-SERBS WITHIN 
THEIR GRASP.  YET IT IS THE SERBS WHO CLAIM THAT THEY 
ARE THE ONES THREATENED AND MISUNDERSTOOD. 
PREDICTABLY, MUCH OF THE DELEGATION\'S TWO-HOUR 
MEETING IN VUKOVAR WAS TAKEN UP WITH A NOW-FAMILIAR 
RECITATION OF ALLEGED SERBIAN GRIEVANCES STRETCHING 
BACK TO BEFORE THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN EMPIRE. 
 
28.  IN SECTOR EAST, AT LEAST, THE ALREADY POOR ODDS 
OF UNPROFOR\'S BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE VANCE PLAN 
-- WITH ITS CURRENT FORCE LEVELS AND MANDATE -- 
APPEAR TO BE STEADILY RECEDING.

HELD BY SERBIAN FORCES IN KAMENICA (NEAR DRVAR) HAVE 
BEEN RELEASED AND TRANSFERED BY ICRC TO THE TRANSIT 
CENTER IN KARLOVAC (REPUBLIC OF CROATIA) RUN BY 
UNHCR.  ANOTHER GROUP OF 25 SERBIAN PRISONERS, HELD 
BY MUSLIM FORCES IN BIHAC AND CAZIN, HAVE BEEN 
RELEASED AND TRANSFERED BY ICRC VIA CROATIA TO OSIJEK 
AND FROM THERE TO THE FRY.  ONE FREED DETAINEE CHOSE 
TO STAY IN THE BIHAC AREA. 
 
2.  ICRC-ZAGREB ALSO REPORTS THAT THE PLANNED RELEASE 
OF OVER 3,000 PRISONERS AT THE MANJACA CAMP HAS BEEN 
INDEFINITELY POSTPONED, IN PART BECAUSE UNHCR HAS 
BEEN UNABLE TO FIND PLACES FOR THE RELEASED DETAINEES

CURRENTLY IN KARLOVAC AND IN PART BECAUSE SERBIAN 
AUTHORITIES HAVE YET TO ORDER THEIR RELEASE (SEE 
PARA. 4).  THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS APPARENTLY 
REFUSED OR BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL TRANSIT 
FACILITIES INSIDE CROATIA.  (COMMENT:  PROCESSING FOR 
THE 1,000 EX-DETAINEES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHOM THE 
U.S. HAS OFFERED TO TAKE IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE 
COMPLETED UNTIL LATE DECEMBER.) 
 
3.  THE TRANSIT FACILITY AT KARLOVAC IS PRESENTLY 
FULL.  ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO HOUSE 2,000 DETAINEES, 
500 PLACES HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE OF THE DANGER POSED 
BY A SEVERELY DAMAGED ORTHODOX CHURCH WHICH IS 
ADJACENT TO THE FACILITY AND COULD COLLAPSE AT ANY 
MOMENT.  ICRC HOPES THAT THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WILL 
AT LEAST PERMIT UNHCR TO REPLACE THESE 500 PLACES 
WHICH HAVE BEEN LOST. 
4.  THE LACK OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM RADOVAN KARADZIC TO 
THE SERBIAN AUTHORITIES RUNNING THE MANJACA CAMP ARE 
REPORTEDLY ANOTHER ELEMENT COMPLICATING THE RELEASE 
OF THE PRISONERS.  DURING A RECENT VISIT TO MANJACA, 
OFDA CONTRACTOR TOM BRENNAN RECEIVED THE IMPRESSION 
THAT THE SERBS RUNNING THE CAMP WOULD BE MORE THAN 
HAPPY TO BE RID OF THE PRISONERS IF THEY WERE ONLY TO 
RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO DO SO.  ICRC-ZAGREB OFFICIALS 
CONFIRMED THESE IMPRESSIONS, ADDING THAT UNSC 
RESOLUTION 780 CREATING A WAR CRIMES COMMISSION 
APPEARS TO HAVE HAD A VISIBLE IMPACT ON THE ATTITUDES 
OF THE CAMP AUTHORITIES.

MISSION TO THE \"PREDSJEDNICKI DVORI\" NOVEMBER 4 TO 
HEAR A STATEMENT OF CROATIAN GOVERNMENT VIEWS ON A 
RANGE OF B-H, UNPA, AND UNPROFOR-RELATED ISSUES. 
OUR RECENT DISCUSSIONS WITH TUDJMAN, REPORTED 
REFTELS, COVERED MUCH OF THIS GROUND. 
 
2.  TUDJMAN DENOUNCED ALLEGATIONS THAT CROATIA AIMS 
TO \"CARVE UP\" B-H OR HAD CONNIVED IN THE FALL OF 
BOSANSKI BROD OR JAJCE.  HE TERMED OWEN\'S SUGGESTION 
OF IMPOSING SANCTIONS ON CROATIA \"ASTONISHING.\" 
CROATIA HAD BEEN AMONG THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE B-H, 
HAD APPOINTED AN AMBASSADOR TO B-H, HAD ACCEPTED OVER 
450,000 B-H REFUGEES, AND, HAD CROATIA NOT HELPED THE 
BOSNIAN CROATS ORGANIZE AGAINST SERBIAN AGGRESSION, 
WOULD NOW BE HOST TO OVER A MILLION B-H REFUGEES. 
FIGHTING AMONG BOSNIAN CROATS AND MUSLIMS RESULTED 
FROM LOCAL FACTORS, NOT FROM LEADERSHIP POLICY 
DECISIONS.  CROATIA BELIEVES B-H CAN SURVIVE AS AN 
INDEPENDENT STATE ONLY AS A UNION OF THREE 
CONSTITUENT PEOPLES -- BUT, \"WITHOUT DOUBT, CROATIA 
IS FOR MAINTAINING THE SOVEREIGNTY OF B-H.\" 
 
3.  ON THE UNPAS AND UNPROFOR, TUDJMAN SAID THAT, 
WHILE CROATIA APPRECIATES THE ROLE THE UN PLAYED IN 
HALTING THE WAR IN CROATIA, UNPROFOR HAD FAILED IN 
ITS ESSENTIAL TASK OF DISARMING THE SERBS IN THE 
UNPAS.  HE CITED NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF HEAVY WEAPONRY 
STILL IN SERB HANDS IN THE UNPAS AND ESTIMATED 
\"WELL-ARMED\" SERBIAN STRENGTH IN THE UNPAS AT 18,000. 
HE CALLED FOR THE UNSC TO AUTHORIZE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
UNPROFOR\'S MANDATE BY FORCE OF ARMS IF NECESSARY.  HE

THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, CROATIA COULD NOT AGREE TO

CROATIAN POLICY TOWARD B-H 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  TUDJMAN BEGAN BY COMMENTING THAT ONE NOW OFTEN 
SEES \"BIASED AND ERRONEOUS\" INTERPRETATIONS OF 
CROATIAN POLICY TOWARD B-H.  HE REFERRED SPECIFICALLY 
TO CLAIMS THAT CROATIA ALONE OR IN CONNIVANCE WITH 
SERBIA AIMED TO \"CARVE UP\" B-H AND SAID SUCH CLAIMS 
WERE UTTERLY UNFOUNDED.  CROATIA HAD NOT ONLY TRIED 
TO PREVENT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN B-H, IT HAD SOUGHT 
CONSISTENTLY TO END THE WAR.  NOTING \"ACCUSATIONS\" 
THAT FORCES FROM CROATIA ITSELF WERE ENGAGED IN B-H, 
TUDJMAN SAID THAT CROATIA HAD HELPED THE CROATS OF 
BOSNIA TO \"ORGANIZE\" THEMSELVES AGAINST SERBIAN/ 
MONTENEGRIN AGGRESSION AND HAD COORDINATED OPERATIONS 
WITH THEM IN CROATIA/B-H BORDER AREAS.  NOTING \"VIEWS, 
EVEN FROM SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL CIRCLES,\" OF CROATIAN 
COMPLICITY IN THE FALL OF BOSANSKI BROD AND JAJCE, 
TUDJMAN SAID THAT THESE TOO WERE GROUNDLESS. 
 
6.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT WAS \"ASTONISHING,\" 
TUDJMAN STATED, THAT OWEN HAD SAID THAT THOUGHT SHOULD 
BE GIVEN TO EXTENDING SANCTIONS TO CROATIA BECAUSE OF 
ITS INVOLVEMENT IN B-H.  CROATIA\'S POLICY TOWARD B-H 
HAD BEEN CONSISTENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.  CROATIA 
HAD BEEN AMONG THE VERY FIRST TO RECOGNIZE B-H AS A 
SOVEREIGN STATE; IT HAD APPOINTED AN AMBASSADOR TO 
B-H; AND, IN ACCORD WITH AGREEMENTS WITH IZETBEGOVIC, 
IT HAD APPOINTED ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO AGREED JOINT

LEFT IN B-H AND OVER A MILLION REFUGEES IN CROATIA. 
 
7.  TUDJMAN ADMITTED THERE HAD BEEN \"A FEW\" INSTANCES 
OF CONFLICT BETWEEN BOSNIAN CROATS AND MUSLIMS; THESE, 
HOWEVER, ORIGINATED FROM LOCAL DISPUTES, NOT AS A 
RESULT OF POLICY DECISIONS BY EITHER LEADERSHIP. 
BOTH SIDES HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO PREVENT RECURRENCES.

8.  TUDJMAN SAID THAT THE ALREADY VERY DIFFICULT 
SITUATION REGARDING NATIONAL, ETHNIC, AND RELIGIOUS 
RELATIONS IN B-H WAS MADE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BY THE 
EXISTENCE OF COMMUNIST HOLDOVERS ON THE SERBIAN SIDE 
AND THE PRESENCE OF MUJAHIDIN IN MUSLIM RANKS. 
CROATIA SEES B-H AS THE EPITOME OF ALL OF THE MOST 
CRITICAL PROBLEMS OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, HE ADDED. 
THE SITUATION IN B-H MUST BE RESOLVED FOR THE GOOD OF 
CROATIAN, EUROPEAN, AND EVEN GLOBAL INTERESTS.  BASED 
ON ITS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CROATIA BELIEVED THAT 
B-H COULD SURVIVE AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE ONLY AS A 
UNION OF THREE CONSTITUENT PEOPLES. 
 
9.  TUDJMAN SAID THAT IN RECENT TALKS WITH 
IZETBEGOVIC CROATIA HAD ESTABLISHED THE BASIS FOR 
RESOLVING ALL MISUNDERSTANDINGS, NOT ONLY BETWEEN 
CROATIA AND B-H BUT ALSO BETWEEN BOSNIAN CROATS AND 
MUSLIMS.  IZETBEGOVIC AGREED WITH THIS ASSESSMENT, 
TUDJMAN CLAIMED.  AND IZETBEGOVIC HAD ACCEPTED THAT 
THE PRESIDENCY OF B-H SHOULD INCLUDE CROATIAN 
REPRESENTATIVES CHOSEN BY THE BOSNIAN CROATS 
THEMSELVES.  \"WITHOUT DOUBT,\" TUDJMAN AFFIRMED, 
CROATIA \"IS FOR MAINTAINING THE SOVEREIGNTY OF B-H.\"

11.  UNPROFOR HAS NOT SUCCEEDED EVEN IN IMPLEMENTING 
THE ESSENTIAL TASK OF DISARMING THE SERBS IN THE 
UNPAS, TUDJMAN STRESSED.  UNPROFOR HAS GOTTEN THE JNA 
OUT OF THE UNPAS AND, NOW, OUT OF PREVLAKA.  BUT

IN THE UNPAS AND NOW HAVE A STRENGTH OF AROUND 18,000 
ORGANIZED, WELL-ARMED MEN.  IN SECTOR EAST, FOR 
EXAMPLE, AROUND BELI MANASTIR, SERBIAN FORCES HAVE 16 
APC\'S \"PAINTED BLUE\" (PRESUMABLY \"MILITIA-BLUE\") PLUS 
10 T-34 TANKS, AND FIVE MORE TANKS IN BATINA.  IN 
SECTOR WEST, NOT ALL OF THE HEAVY WEAPONRY IS 30 KM 
FROM THE BORDER, AS REQUIRED; IN ONE LOCALE ALONE -- 
ON THE BORDER -- THE SERBS HAVE 7 TANKS AND 2 MORTAR 
BATTERIES.  IN SECTOR NORTH, AROUND GLINA AND VIRGIN 
MOST, THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF SERB-HELD 
TANKS AND APC\'S.  AND IN OTHER AREAS, WHERE HEAVY 
ARMS HAVE SUPPOSEDLY BEEN ROUNDED UP, THEY ARE NOT 
WELL SECURED.  IN SECTOR SOUTH, THE SERBS HAVE 9 
TANKS, PLUS ARTILLERY AND MORTARS, AT GRACAC, AS WELL 
AS TANKS AT DRNIS.  IN KNIN, THERE IS A SERB- 
CONTROLLED COMPANY OF T-55 TANKS.  IN BARANJA (SECTOR 
EAST), THERE IS VIRTUALLY A NON-STOP FERRY OF ARMS 
AND PERSONNEL TO AND FROM SERBIA. 
 
12.  TUDJMAN ARGUED THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL MUST 
AUTHORIZE UNPROFOR TO IMPLEMENT THEIR MANDATE, EVEN 
IF THAT REQUIRES RESORTING TO ARMS.  AMONG OTHER 
UNPROFOR SHORTCOMINGS, THERE HAD BEEN VIRTUALLY 
NOTHING DONE TO PERMIT THE RETURN OF THE DISPLACED. 
ON THE CONTRARY, EVEN UNDER THE EYES OF UNPROFOR NEW 
CRIMES ARE BEING COMMITTED BY SERBS.  IN SECTOR EAST, 
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE HAVE BEEN 600 (PRESUMABLY 
NON-SERBS) KILLED SINCE THE DEPLOYMENT OF UNPROFOR. 
IN BARANJA, NOT ONLY CROATS ARE PERSECUTED AND 
KILLED, BUT ALL NON-SERB NATIONALITIES, ESPECIALLY 
HUNGARIANS.  IN ADDITION, THE VANCE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN

PERUCA DAM, WHICH SUPPLIES MUCH OF DALMATIA\'S POWER 
-- AND ALL THIS BECAUSE OF THE INACTIVITY OF 
UNPROFOR, AND THEIR PERMITTING EXTREMIST ELEMENTS OF 
SERBS VIRTUALLY TO RUN FREE IN THE UNPAS. 
 
13.  CONTINUING, TUDJMAN SAID THAT UNPROFOR HAD ALSO 
NOT IMPLEMENTED ITS MANDATE TO CONTROL THE BORDERS 
BETWEEN CROATIA AND SERBIA AND BETWEEN CROATIA AND 
B-H.  HE ALLEGED EVIDENCE OF THE SERBS VIOLATING THE

SANCTIONS AGAINST IMPORT OF OIL AND OTHER GOODS INTO 
SERBIA/MONTENEGRO -- WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF UNPROFOR. 
 
14.  TUDJMAN SAID THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD SEND 
A MEMORANDUM TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL.  HE ASKED 
THAT OTHER GOVERNMENTS SUPPORT CROATIA\'S STAND. 
CROATIA WANTS UNPROFOR IMMEDIATELY TO IMPLEMENT THE 
VANCE PLAN, TUDJMAN EMPHASIZED.  IN THAT REGARD, 
UNPROFOR CAN CONTINUE TO COUNT ON CROATIAN 
COOPERATION.  BUT, UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, CROATIA 
COULD NOT AGREE TO AN EXTENSION OF UNPROFOR\'S 
MANDATE, BECAUSE SERBIAN ELEMENTS ARE USING IT 
(UNPROFOR\'S PRESENCE) TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR POSITION 
IN THE UNPAS AND IN NEIGHBORING AREAS OF B-H. 
 
15.  TUDJMAN SAID CROATIA HAD PROVIDED THE POLITICAL 
PREREQUISITES FOR A RESOLUTION OF THE BASIC PROBLEM 
IN THE UNPAS (PRESUMABLY A REFERENCE TO THE LAW ON 
ABOLITION).  HE REFERRED TO SEVERAL INSTANCES IN 
WHICH GROUPS OF CROATIAN SERBS HAD VOLUNTARILY 
SURRENDERED ARMS \"FORCED ON THEM BY THE JNA\" IN 
HOPES OF NORMALIZING THEIR STATUS IN CROATIA. 
NONETHELESS, HE SAID, THE SITUATION IS WORSENING 
BECAUSE OF EXTREMIST ELEMENTS SUPPLIED BY BELGRADE. 
 
16.  HE SAID THAT CROATIA IS READY TO IMPLEMENT THE 
LAW ON LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING IN THE 
SERBIAN AREAS, IN THE CONTEXT OF HOLDING ELECTIONS TO 
THE SECOND CHAMBER OF THE SABOR IN THE COMING 
TWO-THREE MONTHS.  IN THE MEANTIME, CROATIA WILL PASS

------------------- 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
3.  CROATIA IS NOW HOST TO AT LEAST 750,000 REFUGEES 
AND DISPLACED PERSONS.  THE DIRECT DAILY COST TO THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT OF SUSTAINING THESE PEOPLE IS 
SOME THREE MILLION USD -- AND RISING.  THE INDIRECT 
COSTS TO THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING SOCIAL 
AND HEALTH SERVICES, UTILITY BILLS UNPAID BY FAMILIES 
HOSTING REFUGEES, AND VISIBLE DESTRUCTION OF HOTELS 
AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE BY REFUGEES, ARE INCALCULABLY 
GREATER.  CROATIA RECEIVES FOOD, CLOTHING, AND OTHER 
IN-KIND ASSISTANCE FROM UNHCR, OTHER INTERNATIONAL 
BODIES, OTHER GOVERNMENTS, AND PVO\'S, BUT IT RECEIVES 
NO/NO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP OFFSET EVEN THE 
DIRECT, THREE MILLION USD PER DAY BURDEN, EXCEPT FOR 
SOME VERY RECENT, COMPARATIVELY TINY SUMS FROM A 
COUPLE WESTERN GOVERNMENTS AND UNHCR.  CARING FOR THE 
REFUGEES AND DISPLACED ABSORBS SOME TWENTY PERCENT OF 
CROATIA\'S BUDGET AND CONTRIBUTES HEAVILY TO INFLATION 
NOW RUNNING AT AN ANNUALIZED RATE OF OVER 2,500 
PERCE5.  THE SOCIAL COST OF THE REFUGEE/DISPLACED 
BURDEN -- MEASURED IN LOCAL TENSION LEVELS AND 
PALPABLE PUBLIC RESENTMENT OF REFUGEES AS THE CROATS\' 
LIVING STANDARD PLUMMETS -- IS LARGE AND GROWING.

4.  NOTWITHSTANDING CROATIA\'S HARDER-LINE PUBLIC 
POSTURE OR THE FACT THAT CROATIA HAS INSTITUTED 
BORDER CONTROLS WITH B-H, IT IS NOT/NOT REFUSING TO 
ADMIT B-H REFUGEES.  ON AVERAGE, 2,000-3,000 REFUGEES

FALL OF BOSANSKI BROD, OR THE SEVERAL THOUSAND WHO

LOATH TO TRUMPET THE FACT THAT THIS HEAVY REFUGEE 
FLOW CONTINUES -- INDEED, WHAT GETS PUBLICIZED HERE 
IS THEIR OCCASIONAL REFUSAL OF ENTRY -- FOR FEAR OF 
THE DESTABILIZING IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE ON ALREADY 
STRAINED PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARD THE REFUGEES. 
 
5.  CROATIAN MILITARY AND CIVILIAN OFFICIALS TELL US 
THERE ARE NO PLANS TO TURN BACK BY FORCE OF ARMS 
ANTICIPATED HUGE FLOWS OF REFUGEES FROM THE IMPENDING 
  CALAMITY IN B-H THIS WINTER; PRIVATELY, THEY SAY THEY 
  EXPECT TO BE CONFRONTED WITH AT LEAST 100,000 TO 
  300,000 NEW ARRIVALS.  AT THE SAME TIME, CROATIAN 
  OFFICIALS SAY THERE IS ALMOST NO UNUSED HARDENED 
  SHELTER LEFT, AND CROATIA WILL SIMPLY BE UNABLE TO 
  HOUSE ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES LIKELY 
  EVEN UNDER \"BEST CASE\" SCENARIOS.  CROATIAN OFFICIALS 
  ARE ALSO -- HELPLESSLY, THEY ADMIT -- EXAMINING WHAT 
  THEY CALL \"HORROR\" SCENARIOS INVOLVING UP TO ONE 
  MILLION MORE ARRIVALS FROM B-H, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN 
  SOCIAL BREAKDOWN IN CROATIA. 
 
  6.  CROATIA HAD A \"GENTLEMAN\'S A433.3,5\" WITH THE 
  UNHCR TO MOVE EX-DETAINEES FROM B-H THROUGH THE 
  KARLOVAC TRANSIT FACILITY WITHIN 15 DAYS.  THE WAIT 
  FOR ALL BUT THE FEW WHO HAVE DEPARTED KARLOVAC HAS 
  NOW GROWN TO OVER TWO MONTHS.  DESPITE LOCAL TENSION 
  RESULTING FROM THE EXTENDED PRESENCE OF THESE 
  FREE-TO-ROAM EX-DETAINEES IN WAR-TORN, ECONOMICALLY 
  DEPRESSED KARLOVAC, THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS JUST 
  MADE AVAILABLE SOME 500-700 MORE SPACES IN THIS TOWN. 
  ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO SECURE MORE SPACE IN OTHER

  7.  COMMENT:  ONE DISCUSSES THESE ISSUES WITH 
  KNOWLEDGEABLE CROATS AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF SOME 
  MUTUALLY-UNDERSTOOD PLAIN TRUTHS:  THE REFUGEE 
  PROBLEM IN B-H IS NOT BEING BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL; IT 
  IS GROWING.  WE ARE NOT GAINING GROUND ON THE 
  WINTERIZATION PROBLEM IN B-H; WE ARE LOSING GROUND, 
  AS MORE HOMES ARE DESTROYED EACH DAY.  THE REASON 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02392  03 OF 09  131610Z 
  THESE PROBLEMS ARE ESCALATING IS NEITHER THE 
  OCCASIONAL LOCAL FIREFIGHT BETWEEN CROATIAN AND 
  MUSLIM FORCES NOR BALLYHOOED CROATIAN/SERBIAN 
COLLUSION TO \"CARVE UP\" BOSNIA.  REFUGEES ARE BEING 
GENERATED, OVERWHELMINGLY, BY THE STILL-UNCHECKED 
ETHNIC CLEANSING OF A CONTEMPTUOUSLY ARROGANT BOSNIAN 
SERB LEADERSHIP.  THE MOST LIKELY CONSEQUENCE OF 
CROATIA\'S DOING WHAT THE WEST SAYS IT WANTS CROATIA 
TO DO IN B-H, THAT IS, WITHDRAW MILITARILY, WOULD BE 
THE BOSNIAN SERBS\' ROLLING UP ANOTHER 20-30 PERCENT 
OF B-H TERRITORY AND CROATIA\'S BECOMING SWAMPED 
OVERNIGHT BY ANOTHER HALF MILLION REFUGEES, OR MORE. 
A SIMILAR FATE MIGHT ALREADY HAVE BEFALLEN CROATIA 
WERE IT IN FACT GUILTY OF ETHNIC CLEANSING IN B-H. 
DESPITE THE CLAIMS OF VARIOUS WESTERN EDITORIALISTS, 
HOWEVER, CROATIA HAS NOT/NOT CLEANSED IN B-H -- 
EITHER AS A MATTER OF POLICY OR AS A SIGNIFICANTLY 
WIDESPREAD, RECURRING PRACTICE ON THE GROUND. 
ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS, AND EVEN SOME 
BOSNIAN SERBS, CONTINUE TO LIVE IN RELATIVE PEACE 
WITH THEIR CROATIAN NEIGHBORS IN PARTS OF B-H 
DEFENDED BY CROATIAN OR CROATIAN/B-H GOV\'T FORCES. 
AND LASTLY, CROATIA\'S BORDER WITH B-H, DESPITE THE 
CURRENT CONTROLS, IS INCOMPARABLY MORE OPEN TO 
BOSNIAN REFUGEES THAN THE BORDERS OF ANY OF CROATIA\'S 
CONCERNED WESTERN NEIGHBORS. 
 
8.  COMMENT CONT\'D:  CROATS ONE SPEAKS WITH ARE 
QUIETLY FRUSTRATED AND ANGERED BY THE IMPRESSION 
OCCASIONALLY CONVEYED BY WESTERN CAPITALS THAT 
BOSNIA\'S SYMPTOMS CAN AND MUST BE TREATED -- FOR

9.  COMMENT CONCLUDED:  OPPORTUNISTIC SELF-INTEREST, 
GREED, ALONG WITH A LEGITIMATE DESIRE TO PROTECT 
BOSNIAN CROATS, WAS AMONG CROATIA\'S MOTIVES FOR 
INTERVENING MILITARILY IN B-H IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
AND THERE REMAINS IN ZAGREB A NEAR-UBIQUITOUS, POTENT 
HERCEGOVINIAN ELEMENT WHICH STILL CRAVES ANNEXATION 
IN B-H AND DOES NOT WHOLLY TRUST TUDJMAN TO DO THEIR 
BIDDING.  WE MUST AND WE WILL, THEREFORE, CONTINUE TO 
KEEP THE CROATS\' FEET TO THE FIRE.  BUT OUR AND OTHER 
WESTERN GOVERNMENTS\' EXHORTATIONS TO CROATIA TO ACCEPT 
WHAT IS IN FACT AN EVER MORE SOCIALLY AND FINANCIALLY 
DESTABILIZING NUMBER OF BOSNIAN REFUGEES -- WHILE 
SERBIAN ETHNIC CLEANSING IN B-H AND CROATIA ITSELF

THEY WILL BE CARED FOR BY A FRIEND OR RELATIVE IN A 
THIRD COUNTRY IS ALLOWED TO TRANSIT CROATIA.  (NOTE: 
THE GERMAN EMBASSY SAYS IT PROCESSES AN AVERAGE OF 
1,000 SUCH CASES PER WEEK).  IN ADDITION, CROATIA 
RECENTLY ACCEPTED AN ESTIMATED 9,000 REFUGEES WHEN 
BOSANSKI BROD FELL TO SERBIAN FORCES.  IT HAS ALSO 
ACCEPTED SOME 10-20 PERCENT (LOW THOUSANDS) OF THE

WHO WERE ILL OR NEEDED MEDICAL TREATMENT (SOME OF 
WHOM ARE NOW DIAGNOSED WITH TYPHOID).

11.  GRANIC ACKNOWLEDGED THAT STATISTICS ARE IMPRECISE 
BUT SAID CROATIA NOW CARES FOR AT LEAST 450,000 
MAINLY MUSLIM REFUGEES FROM B-H, 35,000 CROATIAN 
REFUGEES FROM SERBIA, AND 265,000 DISPLACED CROATS. 
GRANIC PROVIDED PER-PERSON-PER-DAY STATISTICS, BROKEN 
DOWN BY HOUSING CATEGORY, ON THE DIRECT COST TO THE 
GOC OF MAINTAINING THESE PEOPLE.  THE COMPLICATED 
MATH IN FACT WORKS OUT TO ABOUT 3 MILLION USD PER DAY, 
WHICH GOES LARGELY TOWARD TOKEN REIMBURSEMENT FOR 
ROOM AND BOARD PROVIDED BY HOTELS.  GRANIC SAID THE 
GOVERNMENT IS NOW TWO TO THREE MONTHS IN ARREARS ON 
THESE DIRECT PAYMENTS. 
 
12.  THE AMOUNTS THE HOTELS RECEIVE DO NOT EVEN BEGIN 
TO COVER MAINTENANCE, SUPPLIES, AND UTILITIES 
EXPENSES, LET ALONE INFRASTRUCTURE DETERIORATION, OR 
LOST OPPORTUNITY COSTS (E.G., THERE ARE NOW ONLY 180 
AVAILABLE TOURIST/BUSINESS HOTEL ROOMS IN ALL OF 
SPLIT).  GRANIC SAID THAT THE AVERAGE REFUGEE-HOUSING 
TOURIST HOTEL IS RUN DOWN TO THE POINT OF REQUIRING 
TOTAL REHABILITATION AFTER ONLY THREE MONTHS. 
(NOTE:  EMBOFFS CAN ATTEST FIRST-HAND THAT THIS 
APPEARS TO BE THE CASE.)  MOREOVER, THE GOC PROVIDES

THEY RECEIVE NO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  CONSEQUENTLY, 
MANY OF THESE HOST FAMILIES HAVE LONG SINCE STOPPED 
PAYING FOR ELECTRICITY AND GAS, THE FULL COST OF 
WHICH THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS HAD TO PAY.  GRANIC 
CITED THE EXAMPLE OF THE TOWN OF MAKARSKA (POP. 
17,000) ON THE ADRIATIC COAST, WHOSE INHABITANTS HAVE 
TAKEN IN 20,000 REFUGEES AND 3,000 DISPLACED PERSONS 
BUT STOPPED PAYING UTILITY BILLS MONTHS AGO.  ONE 
RESULT IS THAT THE GOC IS NOW MONTHS BEHIND ON 
PAYMENTS FOR ELECTRICITY IMPORTED FROM SLOVENIA. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
...WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED HEAVILY TO HYPER-INFLATION 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
14.  PAYMENTS FOR THE REFUGEES AND DISPLACED NOW 
AMOUNT TO SOME 20 PERCENT OF CROATIA\'S NATIONAL 
BUDGET.  THIS AMOUNT, COMBINED WITH THE COST OF 
SUPPORTING 275,000 UNEMPLOYED WORKERS AND 700,000 
PENSIONERS (WHO RECEIVE ON AVERAGE LESS THAN 
ONE-THIRD OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR REFUGEES IN 
HOTELS), HAS CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO A BUDGET DEFICIT 
WHICH HAS SPAWNED HYPER-INFLATION.  THE AVERAGE RATE 
OF INFLATION OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS, ANNUALIZED, 
COMES TO OVER 2,500 PERCENT.  THE GOC HAS RECEIVED 
AND EXPRESSED GRATITUDE FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN FOOD, MEDICINE, HYGENE 
SUPPLIES, CLOTHES, AND THE LIKE, BUT IT HAS RECEIVED 
ONLY TINY AMOUNTS OF AID (LOW MILLIONS) TO HELP OFFSET 
ITS DAY-TO-DAY REFUGEE/DISPLACED-RELATED EXPENSES.

WINTERIZED SHELTER OF ANY KIND LEFT IN CROATIA. 
70,000 B-H REFUGEES ARE STILL IN HOUSING INADEQUATE 
FOR THE COMING WINTER, ALTHOUGH GRANIC SAID THE 
CROATS HOPE SOON TO HAVE ALL THE REFUGEES MOVED INTO 
SOMETHING BETTER THAN TENTS.  (NOTE:  TODAY\'S PRESS, 
HOWEVER, CLAIMS IT WILL BE LATE DECEMBER BEFORE EVEN 
THE REFUGEES NOW HERE ARE ALL MOVED OUT OF TENTS.)

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02392  07 OF 09  131617Z 
THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER, GOES BEYOND LIMITED PHYSICAL 
CAPACITY, GRANIC EMPHASIZED.  LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE 
FLATLY REFUSING TO ACCEPT ADDITIONAL REFUGEES AND THE 
NEAR-CERTAIN HEIGHTENED SOCIAL TENSION THAT WOULD 
ACCOMPANY THEIR ARRIVAL. 
 
16.  GRANIC SAID THAT CROATIAN OFFICIALS HAVE FOUND 
IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE AN ACCEPTABLE SITE 
FOR A SECOND TRANSIT CENTER FOR EX-DETAINEES FROM 
B-H.  WITH SOME 1,500 UNHCR-CARED FOR EX-DETAINEES 
FREE TO ROAM IN DEPRESSED, WAR-TORN KARLOVAC, 
TENSIONS BETWEEN THEM AND THE TOWNSFOLK ARE RISING. 
AS A SOP TO THE KARLOVAC AUTHORITIES, THE GOC HAS HAD 
TO BUDGET ADDITIONAL PUBLIC WORKS FOR THE COMMUNITY. 
GRANIC HIMSELF WAS FINALLY ABLE IN RECENT DAYS TO 
LOCATE SPACE FOR 500-700 MORE EX-DETAINEES IN 
KARLOVAC (WHICH APPARENTLY WILL BE USED FOR SOME OF 
THE MANJACA EX-DETAINEES EXPECTED IMMINENTLY).  BUT 
KARLOVAC HAS FLATLY REFUSED TO TAKE ANY MORE 
EX-DETAINEES, AS HAVE DJAKOVAC AND VODICE, AMONG 
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN APPROACHED.  GRANIC 
CONFIDED THAT HE NOW AVOIDS IF ALL POSSIBLE VISITING 
TOWNS WITH LARGE REFUGEES POPULATIONS, SO OFTEN HAS 
HE COME CLOSE TO BEING MOBBED BY IRATE CITIZENS.  HE 
COMMENTED THAT HE IS CALLED UPON EVERY DAY TO RESOLVE 
THREE OR FOUR LOCAL DISPUTES WHERE DISORDER IS 
THREATENED BETWEEN REFUGEES AND HOST COMMUNITIES. 
THE POTENTIAL SOCIAL PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED BY THE 
FACT THAT REFUGEES IN CROATIA ARE NOT SUBJECT TO 
CONTROLS ON THEIR MOVEMENT.  (ANOTHER OF THE CROATS\' 
NIGHTMARE SCENARIOS IS A LARGE GROUP OF NEW REFUGEES

17.  GRANIC SAID CROATIAN POLICY ON ADMITTING 
ADDITIONAL REFUGEES IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THREE 
FACTORS IN ADDITION TO SPACE LIMITATIONS AND THE 
DIRECT COSTS INVOLVED: 
 
-    -- FIRST AND FOREMOST, CROATIA, LIKE THE UN

ITSELF, WILL NOT WITTINGLY LEND DE FACTO SUPPORT TO 
SERBIAN ETHNIC CLEANSING.  CROATIA\'S PROCLAIMING A 
WIDE-OPEN BORDER WOULD RISK SETTING OFF A MASS 
MIGRATION OF POTENTIALLY OVER A MILLION PEOPLE. 
 
-    -- SECONDLY, ACTIVELY ADMITTING SUBSTANTIAL 
NUMBERS OF ADDITIONAL REFUGEES INTO CROATIA COULD 
RESULT IN A VIOLENT ERUPTION THAT WOULD TEAR APART 
THE FABRIC OF CROATIAN SOCIETY.  WITH THAT IN MIND, 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS REFRAINED FROM WIDELY PUBLICIZING 
THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE REFUGEES FOR FEAR OF 
PROVOKING ITS CITIZENS WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR STANDARD 
OF LIVING REDUCED BY OVER 50 PERCENT IN THE LAST YEAR 
AND A HALF.  (NOTE:  THE AVERAGE CROAT NOW EARNS LESS 
THAN 150 DOLLARS PER MONTH.) 
 
-    -- THIRDLY, THE GOC IS DISAPPOINTED BY THE SLOW 
RESPONSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO THE APPEAL 
TO TAKE EX-DETAINEES TRANSITING KARLOVAC; THEY 
ARRIVED UNDER A GENTLEMAN\'S AGREEMENT WITH UNHCR 
THAT THEY WOULD STAY NO MORE THEN 15 DAYS; MOST OF 
THE FIRST GROUP ARE STILL HERE OVER TWO MONTHS LATER. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
BUT CROATIA HAS NOT CLOSED ITS BORDERS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
18.  NEVERTHELESS, GRANIC SAID, CROATIA -- UNLIKE 
SLOVENIA AND ITS OTHER \"WESTERN\" NEIGHBORS -- HAS NOT 
CLOSED ITS BORDERS.  NOR, DESPITE FACING THE PROSPECT 
OF A MASS INFLUX IN THE COMING MONTHS, HAS CROATIA

UNPA\'S AND PINK ZONES.  REFERING TO SECTORS EAST AND

KNIN, UNPROFOR REASSERTED ITS AUTHORITY TO CONTROL 
BORDER CROSSING POINTS BUT FAILED TO OBTAIN SERBIAN 
AGREEMENT TO DRAW BACK FROM FIVE BRIDGES.  UNPROFOR 
ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 5,000 ARMED, 
UNIFORMED PERSONNEL IN SECTOR EAST AT THE MOMENT; IN 
CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE VANCE PLAN. 
 
2.  THORNBERRY WARNED THAT IF THE LOCAL SERBIAN 
LEADERS DO NOT ACCEPT THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF 
RESOLUTION 762, WHICH CALLS FOR A STEP-BY-STEP 
RESTORATION OF CROATIAN AUTHORITY IN THE PINK ZONES, 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO BE INFORMED.  HE 
STATED THAT UNPROFOR HAS NO INTENTION OF BEING AN 
ACCESSORY TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE RULE OF THE 
PINK ZONES BY AUTHORITIES OTHER THAN THOSE STATED IN 
THE RESOLUTION. 
 
3.  THORNBERRY CONDEMNED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
PUTTING A REPORTED FIFTEEN TONS OF EXPLOSIVES IN THE 
CENTRAL LOWER GALLERY OF THE PERUCA DAM.  AFTER 
FAILING TO OBTAIN MAPS AND DIAGRAMS FROM THE KNIN 
AUTHORITIES, UNPROFOR SENT IN A TEAM OF BRITISH 
DEMOLITIONS EXPERTS.  RECENT PRESS REPORTS INDICATE 
THAT THE MINES HAVE NOW BEEN \"NEUTRALIZED.\"  END 
SUMMARY. 
4.  THERE FOLLOW EXCERPTS FROM AN OFFICIAL SUMMARY OF 
THE UNPROFOR PRESS BRIEFING HELD ON NOVEMBER 5 IN 
BELGRADE BY CEDRIC THORNBERRY, DIRECTOR OF CIVILIAN 
AFFAIRS AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION.

PRESENCE THERE OF THE CROATIAN ARMY AND SERBIAN 
MILITIAS, AND SOME TERRORISM. 
 
6.  SECTOR WEST IS GENERALLY QUIET; IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE VANCE PLAN IS FURTHER ADVANCED THAN IN ANY OTHER 
SECTOR.  THE PROGRAMME OF VISITS OF DISPLACED PERSONS 
FROM BOTH SIDES TO THEIR FORMER VILLAGES IS 
PROGRESSING: AS OF LAST WEEK, 1,500 PEOPLE HAD 
VISITED 50 VILLAGES TO EXAMINE THE DAMAGES TO THEIR 
HOMES AND START PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR REPAIR.  THE 
AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED 500 TEMPORARY HOUSING 
UNITS FOR PEOPLE WHO WISH TO WORK ON THEIR HOUSES

DURING THE WINTER.  IN ONE AREA NEIGHBORING SECTOR 
WEST, UNPROFOR HAS PROVIDED INFORMATION RELATING TO 
RESOLUTION 780 TO THE WAR CRIMES COMMISSION, WHICH 
WAS SCHEDULED TO MEET YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
 
7.  IN SECTORS EAST AND SOUTH, THE TREND TOWARD 
ANARCHY CONTINUES.  GANGS OF TERRORISTS ROAM THE 
AREA, THERE ARE POLICE FORCES WHO DO NOT POLICE, 
PROSECUTORS WHO DO NOT PROSECUTE, AND COURTS THAT ARE 
AFRAID TO SIT.  (UNPROFOR MADE AVAILABLE A PAGE 
GIVING EXTRACTS FROM UNCIVPOL REPORTS SUMMARISING 
RECENT INCIDENTS FROM SECTORS EAST AND SOUTH).  MANY 
OF THESE ARE SMALL, NASTY, COWARDLY CRIMES, USUALLY 
ETHNICALLY BASED AND AIMED AT OLD PEOPLE LIVING 
ALONE.  THE MAJORITY ARE AGAINST CROATS LIVING IN 
SERB-CONTROLLED TERRITORIES, BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME 
AGAINST SERBS LIVING IN CROAT-CONTROLLED AREAS.  IN A 
WAY, THERE HAS BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENT, AS THERE ARE 
FEWER MURDERS THAN BEFORE. 
 
8.  ALONG THE EDGES OF SECTOR SOUTH, SOME CEASE-FIRE 
VIOLATIONS, MAINLY BY THE CROATIAN ARMY, ARE PROBABLY 
PROVOCATIONS.  AS THERE HAS STILL NOT BEEN 
DISARMAMANT OF THE SERB MILITIA, THE CROATIAN ARMY 
HAS, IN SOME CASES, MOVED BACK UP FROM THE WITHDRAWAL 
LINE, TO THE CONFRONTATION LINE, AND THE RELATIVELY 
HEAVILY ARMED SERB MILITIA HAVE ALSO MOVED UP TO THAT 
LINE.

THERE ARE 15 TONNES OF EXPLOSIVES IN THE CENTRAL

RECEIVED THEM, ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION IS NOW URGENT. 
UNPROFOR DOES NOT KNOW WHO PLACED THE EXPLOSIVES, BUT 
CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS IF THE DAM WERE TO BE 
DESTROYED, \"THE LEVEL OF IRRESPONSIBILITY IN 
PREPARING THE DAM FOR DESTRUCTION PASSES 
COMPREHENSION.\"  (NOTE:  PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT

10.  THE REBUILDING OF MASLENICA BRIDGE, LOCATED IN A

SEEMS TO WANT TO \"ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND GET TO

11.  SECTOR EAST HAS BEEN RATHER QUIET LATELY.  AN 
ACCOUNT PUBLISHED IN THE BELGRADE PRESS ON EVENTS 
AROUND BATINA BRIDGE CAUSED THORNBERRY\'S AMAZEMENT, 
AND THE CONCLUSION THAT \"IF YOU DON\'T HAVE ANY FACTS, 
GO UP TO THE CRAZIEST PERSON AROUND AND PUBLISH WHAT 
HE SAYS.\" 
 
12.  ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE, UNPROFOR ESTIMATES THERE 
ARE AT LEAST 5,000 ARMED, UNIFORMED PERSONNEL IN 
SECTOR EAST AT THE MOMENT; IN CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE 
VANCE PLAN.  UNPROFOR IS NOT SURE WHO IS IN CONTROL 
OF ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS.  \"PERHAPS UNPROFOR BELGRADE 
COULD ORGANIZE A TOUR FOR JOURNALISTS SO THEY COULD 
SEE FOR THEMSELVES? -  SECTOR EAST IS QUITE CLOSE TO 
BELGRADE.\"  (NOTE:  PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT IN 
FACT A VISIT BY JOURNALISTS IS NOW BEING ARRANGED.)

OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, THE KNIN AUTHORITIES AGREED 
TO MOVE THEIR CHECKPOINTS BACK CA. 500 METRES FROM

14.  THE SERIOUS DESIRE FOR PEACE THAT IS APPARENT IN 
MANY PARTS OF THE REGION OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA 
COULD BE ENDANGERED BY THE BLOCKAGES IN THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VANCE PLAN IN THE SECTORS. 
 
15.  AT PREVLAKA, APART FROM A FEW PROBLEMS, THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VANCE PLAN IS PROCEEDING QUITE 
WELL.  THE YUGOSLAV ARMY HAS WITHDRAWN, IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH THE VANCE PLAN, AND MILITARY OBSERVERS ARE NOW 
DEPLOYED.  THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS, HOWEVER, OF 
CROATIAN ARMY ACTIVITIES IN ADJACENT AREAS.

FOREIGN MINISTER OF MACEDONIA,  OTHER GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, REPRESENTATIVES OF 
THE ALBANIAN COMMUNITY AND OTHERS.  THE DELEGATION 
ALSO VISITED A CAMP FOR REFUGEES, FLEEING THE HORRIBLE

GREEK DEPUTY MINISTER, IN THESSALONIKI, IMMEDIATELY 
BEFORE AND AFTER THE VISIT.  WE ALSO HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH U.S. DIPLOMATS IN MACEDONIA, 
AS WELL AS THE HEAD OF THE CSCE SPILLOVER MISSION 
THERE. 
 
\"WE LEFT MACEDONIA CONVINCED THAT INTERNATIONAL 
RECOGNITION OF THAT COUNTRY WOULD BE THE RIGUT THING 
TO DO, AND THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE IMMEDIATELY.  THE 
UNITED STATES SHOULD ALSO MORE FORCEFULLY PRESS FOR 
MACEDONIAN INCLUSION IN THE CSCE,  THE UNITED NATIONS 
AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.  WE WILL 
RECOMMEND THIS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT UPON OUR RETURN 
TO WASHINGTON. 
 
\"WE BELIEVE THAT MACEDONIA DESERVES THE RECOGNITION IT 
HAS REQUESTED FOR SEVERAL REASONS.  FIRST, IT WOULD 
HELP UNLOCK THE ECONOMIC STRANGLEHOLD ITS 
INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION HAS PLACED ON MACEDONIA.  WE 
WERE DEEPLY DISTURBED, AS WE SAW MACEDONIA\'S FIRST 
SNOW OF THE WINTER, BY THE INCREDIBLE SHORTAGE OF FUEL 
FOR HEATING, TRANSPORTATION AND AGRICULTURAL 
PRODUCTION.  SECOND, RECOGNITION SEEMS TO BE A 
NECESSARY FIRST STEP FOR THE COUNTRY TO MOVE FORWARD 
IN BUILDING DEMOCRACY AND A MARKET-BASED ECONOMY. 
THIRD, IT WOULD DISCOURAGE THE EXPANSION OF THE 
YUGOSLAV CONFLICT INTO MACEDONIA THROUGH THE 
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT AND RESPECT WHICH RECOGNITION 
IMPLIES, AS 
WELL AS THE INTERNATIONAL STABILIZATION IT WOULD 
PROMOTE.  FINALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT MACEDONIA IS

\"THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT TO SAY THAT WE DO NOT HAVE 
CONCERNS REGARDING MACEDONIA.  INDEED, SOME ASPECTS OF 
MACEDONIAN SOCIETY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO THE DANGEROUS, 
EXTREME NATIONALISM THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY ALL TOO 
COMMON IN THE REGION. THIS NATIONALISM ENCOURAGES 
DIVISION AND TENSION WITHIN THE COUNTRY\'S SMALL BUT 
DIVERSE POPULATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE HEARD REPORTS 
THAT THE RIGHTS OF THOSE BELONGING TO MACEDONIA\'S 
LARGE ETHNIC ALBANIAN POPULATION ARE FREQUENTLY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

VIOLATED,  AND THAT THEY ARE GIVEN ONLY A NOMINAL ROLE 
IN THE COUNTRY\'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS, 
MAKING THEM FEEL EXCLUDED FROM DECISIONS AFFECTING THE 
COUNTRY\'S FUTURE.  SIMILARLY, THIS NATIONALISM 
ENCOURAGES AN INACCURATE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT 
WRONGLY AND NEEDLESSLY PLAYS ON THE SENSITIVITIES OF 
MACEDONIA\'S NEIGHBORS, ESPECIALLY GREECE.  THE NEW 
MACEDONIAN FLAG IS BUT ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS.  WE DO NOT 
BELIEVE MOST MACEDONIANS HAVE FALLEN PREY TO THIS 
VIRULENT NATIONALISM, BUT GREATER EFFORTS MUST BE 
TAKEN TO COUNTER THIS TREND IN A DEMOCRATIC WAY AND TO 
MAKE ALL THOSE LIVING IN MACEDONIA FEEL THAT THEY ARE 
CITIZENS WITH EQUAL RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES.  ALL 
LOSE IF MACEDONIA\'S ETHNIC GROUPS CHOOSE TO FIGHT 
NATIONALISM WITH NATIONALISM.  EVEN DURING THESE 
DIFFICULT TIMES, REASON MUST BE ALLOWED TO PREVAIL. 
 
\"MOREOVER, GREECE IS A CLOSE FRIEND AND ALLY OF THE 
UNITED STATES, WITH A LEGITIMATE AND UNDERSTANDABLE 
CONCERN FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS REGION, A POINT WE 
EMPHASIZED IN OUR TALKS WITH GREEK OFFICIALS.  WE 
ENCOURAGE A MORE DIRECT AND INTENSIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN 
SKOPJE AND ATHENS, INCLUDING THROUGH CHANNELS OFFERED 
BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, THAT WILL HOPEFULLY LEAD TO 
A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
THEM IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.  BOTH SIDES NEED TO TALK 
AND COMPROMISE.

THE ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF MACEDONIA IN INTERNATIONAL

EXPRESSED MORE CONCERN FOR THOSE LEFT BEHIND THAN THEY 
DID FOR THEIR OWN FUTURES AS REFUGEES.  WE ALSO HAD AN

MORE EXPENSE, SHE ARGUED.  FORMER COMMUNIST PARTY

THE LATEST GROUP OF SERBIAN DEATH CAMP SURVIVORS IN 
KARLOVAC.  PRESIDENT TUDJMAN TOLD THE CODEL THAT:  HE

INABILITY TO DO SO WOULD RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHY 
UNPROFOR SHOULD BE EXTENDED; WITHOUT PEACE IN B-H, 
CROATIA COULD NEVER SECURE ITS BORDERS; THERE ARE NO 
CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN CROATIA AND THE THREE BOSNIAN 
CROAT DETENTION FACILITIES HAD BEEN ORDERED CLOSED BY 
BOBAN; CROATIA HAS NO TERRITORIAL DESIGNS ON B-H; IT 
SUPPORTS A SOVEREIGN, INDEPENDENT B-H COMPRISED OF 
THREE CONSTITUENT PEOPLES; THIS DID NOT MEAN DIVIDING 
B-H INTO THREE TERRITORIAL UNITS; CROATIA IS 
THREATENED WITH ECONOMIC DISASTER, IN PART OWING TO 
ITS REFUGEE BURDEN; CROATIA IS ACTIVELY SEEKING 
NORMALIZATION WITH THE SERBS OF CROATIA.

ABOUT.  THE MORE THAN 2,000 EX-DETAINEES IN KARLOVAC 
AT THE TIME OF THE CODEL\'S VISIT INCLUDED OVER 700 
MEN JUST RELEASED FROM MANJACA.  THE CODEL TOURED THE 
MASSIVELY OVERCROWDED FACILITY, VIEWING SLEEPING ROOMS

TAXED SANITATION FACILITIES, HALLWAYS SO CRAMMED WITH 
STILL-TRAUMATIZED MEN THAT MOVEMENT WAS NEXT TO 
IMPOSSIBLE, AND UNDERSTAFFED ICRC AND UNHCR 
CONTINGENTS ENGAGED IN A VALIANT, SUPERMHUMAN EFFORT 
TO MEET THE EX-DETAINEES BASIC NEEDS.  AT A TABLE IN 
THE FEW SQUARE FEET OF SPACE NOT OCCUPIED BY BEDS OR

ACCOUNTS OF SAVAGE MURDERS, SADISTIC TORTURE AND 
ASSORTED MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DEPRAVITY WHICH 
CHARACTERIZED EVERYDAY LIFE IN THE CAMPS.  ON EXITING 
THE FACILITY, THE CODEL SPOKE FRANKLY TO THE PRESS

4.  SENATOR DECONCINI TOLD PRESIDENT TUDJMAN THAT THE 
U.S. CONGRESS REMAINED VERY CONCERNED ABOUT EVENTS IN 
THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.  HE NOTED HIS JUST-CONCLUDED 
VISIT TO THE EX-DETAINEE TRANSIT CAMP AND THE UGLY 
STORIES THAT HE HAD HEARD THERE. 
 
5.  TUDJMAN WELCOMED THE DELEGATION AND REITERATED 
CROATIA\'S COMMITMENT TO DEVELOP A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. 
HE NOTED THAT HE HAD WON A MANDATE IN HIS RE-ELECTION 
AS PRESIDENT IN AUGUST.  HE RECALLED THAT THE ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN HAD BEGUN WITH CONCERN THAT EXTREMISTS OF 
THE RIGHT AND LEFT -- THE CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHT AND 
THE EX-COMMUNISTS CROATIAN PARTY OF RENEWAL -- WOULD 
EACH GARNER SOME 15 PERCENT OF THE VOTE.  IN THE 
EVENT, EACH EXTREME WON ONLY 3-5 PERCENT.

CROATIA\'S ECONOMIC PLIGHT 
------------------------- 
 
6.  TUDJMAN SAID THAT CROATIA FACED SERIOUS ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS AS IT MADE THE TRANSITION FROM A SOCIALLY- 
OWNED TO A FREE-MARKET ECONOMY.  INFLATION IS 
CLIMBING, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE 
FORMER YUGOSLAV MARKET AND THE BURDEN OF MILITARY 
DEFENSE EXPENDITURES.  THE WAR DESTROYED A GREAT PART 
OF CROATIA\'S PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. .

CROATIA SUPPORTED SOME 300,000 DISPLACED CROATS AND 
450,000 REFUGEES FROM BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA (B-H).  THIS 
WAS BEYOND CROATIA\'S ABILITY TO COPE.  INTERNATIONAL 
HELP FOR THE REFUGEES HAD BEEN INSUFFICIENT.  THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S AIM WAS TO CONTROL INFLATION SUFFICIENTLY 
TO MOVE TO CURRENCY CONVERTIBILITY IN 1993. 
 
---------------------- 
UNPROFOR AND THE UNPAS 
---------------------- 
- 
7.  TUDJMAN SAID UNPROFOR MUST COMPLETE ITS MISSION, 
WHICH IS TO IMPLEMENT THE VANCE PLAN FULLY.  HE ASKED 
RHETORICALLY WHY, IF UNPROFOR WERE UNABLE TO 
IMPLEMENT THE VANCE PLAN BY MARCH 1993, IT SHOULD BE 
EXTENDED.  HE SAID CROATIA WANTED TO SEE:  1) THE 
RETURN OF THE DISPLACED PERSONS; 2) DISARMING OF THE 
SERBIAN PARAMILITARIES; AND 3) REOPENING OF 
TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION LINKS THROUGHOUT THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

COUNTRY.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THE SERBS IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS PROTECTED AREAS (UNPAS) ARE ONLY A SMALL 
PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SERBS IN CROATIA. 
BUT PROGRESS IN THESE AREAS WAS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT 
ON RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT IN BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CROATIA\'S ACTIONS IN BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8.  TUDJMAN SAID CROATIA HAD A VITAL INTEREST IN 
PEACE IN B-H, WITHOUT WHICH THERE COULD NEVER BE 
PEACE ALONG CROATIA\'S BORDERS WITH B-H.  CROATIA 
WANTS B-H TO REMAIN A SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT 
NATION OF ITS THREE CONSTITUENT PEOPLES, TUDJMAN 
STATED.  B-H\'S POLITICAL ORGANIZATION MUST BE BASED 
ON THE RIGHTS OF ALL THREE PEOPLES.  IN B-H, THE TWO 
KEY PROBLEMS ARE:  HOW TO STOP SERBIAN AGGRESSION AND 
HOW TO GET THE MUSLIMS TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. 
 
9.  SENATOR DECONCINI NOTED THAT VARIOUS CRITICISMS 
WERE OFTEN LEVELLED AGAINST CROATIA IN THE U.S.  HE 
ASKED TUDJMAN HOW ONE OUGHT TO RESPOND TO CHARGES 
THAT THE CROATS TOO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN ATROCITIES IN 
DETENTION CAMPS THEY RAN IN B-H AND THAT CROATIA HAD 
TERRITORIAL DESIGNS ON PARTS OF B-H.  THE SENATOR 
ADDED THE QUESTION WHETHER, IF CROATIA WERE FIXED ON 
A \"THREE PEOPLES\" APPROACH TO B-H, IT WOULD BE 
POSSIBLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT A DIVISION OF 
B-H TERRITORY.

10.  TUDJMAN SAID THE BOSNIAN CROATS HAD TAKEN UP 
ARMS BECAUSE THEY FELT THREATENED BY SERBIAN 
AGGRESSION AND BECAUSE THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN 
SARAJEVO HAD NOT PREPARED ADEQUATELY TO DEFEND THEM. 
THE BOSNIAN CROATS INITIALLY FELT SO ENDANGERED THAT 
MANY OF THEM WERE ADVOCATING SECESSION AND JOINING 
CROATIA.  IT WAS THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT, TUDJMAN 
SAID, WHICH HAD BLUNTED THE SECESSION MOVE AND 
STRONGLY URGED BOSNIAN CROATS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
B-H INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM.  ULTIMATELY, BOSNIA\'S 
CROATS WERE THE FIRST TO OPPOSE SERBIAN AGGRESSION. 
ONLY LATER HAD THE MUSLIMS JOINED IN IN A SIGNIFICANT 
WAY. 
 
11.  TUDJMAN SAID CATEGORICALLY THAT THERE WERE NO 
CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN CROATIA AND, AS FAR AS HE 
KNEW, NONE IN THE CROATIAN-DEFENDED AREAS OF B-H. 
DURING THE WAR WITH THE YUGOSLAV ARMY LAST YEAR, 
CROATIA HAD HAD SEVERAL POW CAMPS BUT THOSE WERE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

CLOSED WHEN THE PRISONERS WERE EXCHANGED.  TUDJMAN 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN INDIVIDUAL CASES OF 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CROATIA BY EXTREMISTS, 
EVEN THOUGH THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAD CALLED ON THE 
PEOPLE TO ACT RESPONSIBLY.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY 
WAS STRICT RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL THE PEOPLE 
OF CROATIA.  LATER IN THE CONVERSATION, DEPUTY 
PREMIER GRANIC CLARIFIED THAT THE BOSNIAN CROATS 
MAINTAINED THREE DETENTION CAMPS, ALL OF WHICH HAD 
BEEN VISITED BY THE ICRC.  MATE BOBAN, AT \"GENEVA\'S\" 
REQUEST, HAD ORDERED ALL THREE CLOSED.  GRANIC SAID 
CROATIA HAD ONLY SOME 30 SERBIAN PRISONERS, WHO HAD 
BEEN AWAITING EXCHANGE WITH SERBIA -- BUT PANIC HAD 
BEEN UNABLE TO DELIVER. 
 
12.  TUDJMAN STATED THAT CROATIA HAD NO TERRITORIAL 
DESIGNS ON B-H.  HOWEVER, CROATIA IS VITALLY 
INTERESTED IN B-H DEVELOPMENTS928,& 59 &39-POLITICAL 
AND HISTORICAL REALITIES.  A B-H SOLUTION BASED ON 
THE THREE CONSTITUENT PEOPLES DID NOT MEAN DIVISION 
INTO THREE TERRITORIAL UNITS.  CROATIA COULD WORK 
WITH THE VANCE/OWEN 7-9 UNITS APPROACH. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
ENDING THE B-H WAR WOULD HELP WITH KOSOVO 
----------------------------------------- 
 
13.  TUDJMAN AGREED WITH REPRESENTATIVE MCCLOSKEY\'S 
EXPRESSION OF CONCERN OVER SERBIAN ACTIONS IN KOSOVO. 
TUDJMAN SAID THE KEY TO PREVENTING WAR IN KOSOVO WAS 
TO STOP IT IN B-H.  THE BELGRADE GOVERNMENT HAD ACTED

UNJUSTLY IN DEPRIVING THE ALBANIANS IN KOSOVO OF THE 
RIGHTS THEY HELD UNDER TITO\'S SYSTEM.  HE AGREED THERE 
WAS A RISK OF WAR EXPANDING INTO MACEDONIA, WHICH 
SERBS STILL SOMETIMES REFER TO AS \"SOUTHERN SERBIA.\" 
POSSIBLE GREEK/SERBIAN COLLUSION OVER MACEDONIA WAS 
ALSO OF CONCERN.

BALKAN PROBLEMS.  HE RECALLED THERE HAD BEEN A STRONG 
AMERICAN INFLUENCE IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND HE 
SUGGESTED THAT IT COULD AGAIN BE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE

READY TO COOPERATE IN FINDING WAYS TO END THE 
CONFLICTS IN THE REGION AND TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS

CROATIAN PEOPLE HAD MANY FRIENDS IN THE CONGRESS AND 
THAT HIS VISIT WAS A TANGIBLE EXPRESSION OF THAT 
FRIENDSHIP AND INTEREST IN CROATIA.  HE SAID HIS 
DELEGATION WAS PLEASED TO HEAR FROM HIM DIRECTLY OF

CROATIA AND THE REFUGEES

16.  THE SENATOR EXPRESSED SYMPATHY FOR CROATIA\'S 
REFUGEE BURDEN, ABOUT WHICH NOT ENOUGH WAS KNOWN IN 
THE WEST.  HE PLEDGED TO DO WHAT HE COULD TO GET THE 
WORD OUT ON CROATIA\'S REFUGEE BURDEN AND THE NEED FOR 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE. 
 
17.  TUDJMAN SAID THE CROATIAN PEOPLE WERE PRETTY 
DISSATISFIED WITH THE EC AND THE UN CONSTANTLY 
TELLING THEM OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATION TO TAKE 
EVER MORE REFUGEES, EVEN AS CROATIA LACKED THE MEANS 
TO CARE FOR ITS OWN DISPLACED PEOPLE.  HE NOTED THAT 
THE PREVIOUS DAY HE HAD PERSONALLY INTERVENED AT THE 
BEHEST OF THE ZAGREB JEWISH COMMUNITY TO APPROVE THE 
MOVEMENT TO CROATIA OF A GROUP OF 500 FROM SARAJEVO. 
\"BUT WE ARE NOW THREATENED WITH ECONOMIC DISASTER,\" 
TUDJMAN EXCLAIMED.

18.  DEPUTY PREMIER GRANIC SAID CROATIA NOW HAS 
450,000 BOSNIAN REFUGEES, 80 PERCENT OF WHOM ARE 
MUSLIM.  THE REFUGEE BURDEN ABSORBS 20 PERCENT OF THE 
CROATIAN STATE BUDGET.  GRANIC SAID CROATIA WAS 
EXTREMELY PERPLEXED BY CRITICISM OF CROATIA\'S 
SUPPOSEDLY CLOSED BORDERS.  THE FACT IS THAT 
CROATIA\'S ARE THE ONLY OPEN BORDERS IN THE REGION. 
SINCE CROATIA HAD INSTITUTED ITS BORDER \"CONTROLS\" ON 
JULY 13, SOME 100,000 BOSNIAN REFUGEES HAD ARRIVED IN 
CROATIA AND ANOTHER 100,000 HAD TRANSITTED.  CROATIA 
IS ALSO TAKING IN HUNDREDS OF EX-DETAINEES FROM THE 
SERBIAN PRISON CAMPS IN B-H.  GRANIC REITERATED 
CROATIA\'S APPRECIATION FOR THE MATERIAL HELP IT HAD 
RECEIVED, BUT HE STRESSED THAT CROATIA ALSO NEEDS 
MONEY TO PAY FOR ELECTRICITY, GASOLINE AND OTHER 
REFUGEE-RELATED DIRECT COSTS -- NOW RUNNING AT 110 
MILLION DOLLARS PER MONTH.

--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
19.  CROATIA WANTS TO SEE AN END TO AGGRESSION AND A 
RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE, INCLUDING NORMALIZATION OF 
RELATIONS WITH SERBS IN CROATIA, TUDJMAN SAID.  HE 
POINTED OUT THAT CROATIA HAD PASSED LAWS ON ABOLITION 
(FOR THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE WAR AGAINST 
CROATIA BUT DID NOT COMMIT WAR CRIMES) AND AMNESTY 
(FOR THOSE ALREADY INDICTED OR SENTENCED FOR NON-WAR 
CRIMES ACTS COMMITTED IN THE WAR).  HE EMPHASIZED THE 
EFFORTS HIS GOVERNMENT WAS MAKING TOWARD RESTORATION 
OF LAW AND ORDER THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAD WORKED TO REIN IN CROATIAN 
EXTREMISTS AND HAD SEVERAL OF THEM WERE UNDER 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.  VICE PRESIDENT OF THE 
PARLIAMENT DUKIC, A SERBIAN HIMSELF, POINTED OUT THAT 
THE SERBS IN THE UNPAS ARE UNDER THE DOMINATION OF 
THE 5-10 PERCENT EXTREMISTS WHO ARE CONTROLLED BY 
BELGRADE. 
 
20.  IN CONCLUSION, PRESIDENT TUDJMAN TOLD THE CODEL 
THAT CROATIA IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY AND TO 
A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, INCLUDING A FREE PRESS.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  IN A LATE EVENING MEETING NOV 27, SENATOR MOYNIHAN 
SHARED WITH PRESIDENT TUDJMAN HIS IMPRESSIONS AFTER 
HAVING PERSONALLY VIEWED THE DEVASTATION IN SARAJEVO, 
MOSTAR, AND THE DUBROVNIK AREA.  THE SENATOR SAID HE 
HAD BEEN TOLD BY UNHCR IN SARAJEVO THAT THE CITY IS 
DOWN TO ONLY ONE DAY\'S FOOD SUPPLY. 
 
2.  TUDJMAN SAID SERBIAN EXTREMISTS HAVE CLEARLY 
OPTED FOR WAR; SANCTIONS WOULD NOT STOP THEM.  THE

SERBS WERE COUNTING ON CONTINUED WESTERN DISUNITY 
OVER EX-YUGO AND ON RUSSIAN SUPPORT; SEVERAL HUNDRED 
RUSSIAN \"VOLUNTEERS\" ARE NOW FIGHTING ON THE SERBIAN 
SIDE.  HE CALLED FOR SELECTIVE AIR STRIKES ON SERBIAN 
MILITARY BASES AND FACTORIES AND NOTED SERB CLAIMS TO 
BE ON THE VERGE OF BUILDING \"GUIDED MISSILES.\" 
TUDJMAN SAID THAT LIFTING THE ARMS EMBARGO WOULD ONLY 
ENSURE THAT THE CARNAGE SPREAD AND LASTED ANOTHER 1-2 
YEARS; IT WOULD NOT OVERCOME THE SERBS\' MILITARY 
SUPERIORITY.  ON CROATIA\'S WAR-RELATED ECONOMIC 
DISPLACEMENT AND REFUGEE BURDEN, TUDJMAN COMMENTED, 
\"IT\'S A MIRACLE WE HAVE SURVIVED  ALL OF THIS.\" 
 
END SUMMARY.

3.  SENATOR MOYNIHAN TOLD THE PRESIDENT HOW DEEPLY 
TOUCHED HE WAS BY THE AMOUNT OF DESTRUCTION HE HAD 
WITNESSED IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA (B-H). 
HE NOTED THAT DUBROVNIK APPEARED BATTERED, ALBEIT 
REPAIRABLE.   ON THE OTHER HAND, THE TOWN OF SLANO, 
JUST NORTH OF DUBROVNIK, HAD BEEN UTTERLY DESTROYED. 
THE ATTACKERS WHO HAD OCCUPIED AND WRECKED THE TOWN 
LEFT GRAFFITI ON THE WALLS, IN ENGLISH AND SERBO- 
CROATIAN, STATING \"YOU ASKED FOR IT|\"  LIKEWISE, 
MOSTAR WAS A DEVASTATED CITY.  SERBIAN TACTICS WERE 
EVIDENTLY TO SHELL CITIES FROM AFAR, KILL OR STARVE 
THE POPULACE, AND ONLY THEN MOVE IN FOR THE CAPTURE.

5.  TUDJMAN SAID HE TOO HAD TOURED THE COASTAL AREA 
AND HAD SEEN FIRSTHAND THE SCALE OF DESTRUCTION.  HE 
POINTED OUT THAT THE DEVASTATION WAS FAR GREATER 
SOUTH OF DUBROVNIK, IN THE DIRECTION OF MONTENEGRO. 
HE HAD LIVED THROUGH A WORLD WAR, BUT THE BARBARITY 
OF ACTION IN THIS CONFLICT WAS UNPRECEDENTED.

6.  SENATOR MOYNIHAN TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT HE HAD 
OVERNIGHTED IN SARAJEVO NOV 24, TOURED THE CITY, MET 
WITH PRESIDENT IZETBEGOVIC, AND BEEN BRIEFED BY UNHCR 
ON THE PRECARIOUS FOOD SUPPLY SITUATION.  HE HAD BEEN 
TOLD BY UNHCR THAT SARAJEVO WAS DOWN TO ONLY ONE 
DAY\'S FOOD SUPPLY; INCOMING FOOD ON CONVOYS AND 
RELIEF FLIGHTS IS DISTRIBUTED AND CONSUMED.  TUDJMAN 
SAID IZETBEGOVIC HAD PROBABLY INFORMED THE SENATOR 
THAT SOME 128,000 BOSNIANS HAD BEEN KILLED AND 30,000 
GIRLS AND WOMEN RAPED BY SERBIAN FORCES IN B-H.  THESE 
FIGURES MIGHT, OF COURSE, BE EXAGGERATED, BUT EVEN IF 
THE REAL FIGURES WERE ONLY HALF, THE NUMBERS WERE 
STILL OUTRAGEOUS.

7.  NOTING THAT THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL HAD 
ESTABLISHED A WAR CRIMES COMMISSION, THE SENATOR 
ASKED THE PRESIDENT WHAT STEPS THAT THE U.S. AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD TAKE NEXT.  TUDJMAN 
SAID BLUNTLY THAT SANCTIONS ALONE WILL NOT STOP 
SERBIAN AGGRESSION.  SERBIAN POLITICS HAS BECOME 
IRRATIONAL.  SERBIAN EXTREMISTS FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A 
BETTER CHANCE TO CREATE A \"GREATER SERBIA\" BY WAR 
THAN BY OTHER MEANS.  THEY CITE THE EXAMPLE OF HOW

LACK OF RESOLVE, COUPLED WITH SUPPORT FROM ORTHODOX- 
LEANING RUSSIA, WOULD HELP THEM.  THERE ARE CREDIBLE 
REPORTS THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED RUSSIAN \"VOLUNTEERS\" ARE 
NOW FIGHTING ON THE SERBIAN SIDE IN B-H. 
 
8.  TUDJMAN CALLED FOR THE WEST TO EMPLOY SELECTIVE 
AIR STRIKES.  WESTERN GROUND FORCES ARE NOT NEEDED. 
THE AIR POWER SHOULD BE DIRECTED AGAINST SERBIAN AIR 
BASES, MILITARY FACTORIES, ARTILLERY EMPLACEMENTS, 
AND OTHER MILITARY SITES.  THE SERBS ARE NOW OPENLY 
BOASTING ABOUT THEIR MILITARY MIGHT AND THEIR INTENT 
TO BEGIN BUILDING \"GUIDED MISSILES.\"  SELECTIVE AIR

9.  GENERAL MORILLON, THE UNPROFOR COMMANDER IN 
SARAJEVO, HAD TOLD SENATOR MOYNIHAN THAT HE WAS 
STRONGLY OPPOSED TO LIFTING OF THE ARMS EMBARGO. 
ASKED FOR HIS VIEW, TUDJMAN SAID THAT LIFTING THE 
ARMS EMBARGO WOULD MERELY ENSURE THAT THE DEATH AND 
DEVASTATION SPREAD AND CONTINUED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 
YEAR OR TWO.  THE SERBS ALREADY HAVE SUCH AN 
ADVANTAGE IN COMBAT AIRCRAFT, TANKS, AND ARTILLERY 
THAT THEIR MILITARY SUPERIORITY WOULD NOT BE 
CHALLENGED ANYTIME SOON, EVEN IF ARMS STARTED TO FLOW 
TO THEIR OPPONENTS IMMEDIATELY. 
 
10.  TUDJMAN SAID THE SOLUTION TO THE B-H CRISIS IS 
TO STOP SERBIAN AGGRESSION AND AIR STRIKES OUGHT TO 
BE USED TO THAT END.  HE SPECULATED THAT B-H MIGHT 
HAVE TO BECOME A UN \"PROTECTORATE\" TO BE SAVED.  HE 
SAID IT HAD BEEN A MISTAKE FOR THE EC COUNTRIES AND 
ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE SO REPETITIVELY 
CLEAR AT THE OUTSET OF THE CRISIS THAT THEY WOULD NOT 
INTERVENE MILITARILY.  THE SERBS HAD SEEN IN THIS 
STANCE A VIRTUAL GREEN LIGHT FOR MILITARY ACTION 
WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION.

11.  JNA/SERBIAN MILITARY AGGRESSION AGAINST CROATIA 
LAST YEAR HAD AS ONE OF ITS GOALS THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT 
OF THE FORMER COMMUNIST SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE FORMER 
YUGOSLAVIA.  A SECONDARY GOAL WAS SERBIAN CONQUEST OF 
PARTS OF CROATIAN TERRITORY.  SERBIAN MILITARY 
STRATEGISTS HAD COUNTED ON SUPPORT FROM SOVIET 
MILITARY OFFICERS, INCLUDING MANY OF THOSE WHO 
PLOTTED AGAINST GORBACHEV. 
 
12.  AT THE START OF THE YUGO-CRISIS, CROATIA\'S GOAL 
WAS CONFEDERATION.  TITO HIMSELF HAD FORESEEN THE

A MAJOR EXPENSE (NOTE:  20 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL

IMPORTANT LOSS OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAV MARKET AND THE 
WIDESPREAD ECONOMIC DEVASTATION CROATIA HAD SUFFERED 
IN THE WAR.  \"IT\'S A MIRACLE THAT WE HAVE SURVIVED 
ALL OF THIS,\" TUDJMAN SAID.  HE SAID THAT SUPPORT 
FROM THE CROATIAN DIASPORA HAD BEEN CRITICAL IN THE 
COUNTRY\'S SURVIVAL. 
 
14.  TUDJMAN SAID CROATIA IS COUNTING ON U.S. SUPPORT 
FOR EARLY ADMISSION TO SUCH LFI\'S AS THE IMF AND

AND WISHED TUDJMAN AND CROATIA EVERY SUCCESS IN

MR. PRESIDENT OF THE USA: 
 
SINCE I AM AN EYEWITNESS, I WANT TO GIVE MY STATEMENT 
ABOUT THE MASSACRE IN BRCKO... 
 
THE YUGOSLAV ARMY OCCUPIED THE GREATER PART OF BRCKO 
ON MAY 1, 1992.  THE CITIZENS WERE UNPREPARED FOR THE 
SERBIAN OCCUPATION BECAUSE YUGO ARMY REPRESENTATIVES 
HAD PROMISED OVER THE RADIO SECURITY AND PEACE JUST 
THREE DAYS BEFORE THE OCCUPATION.  I WAS AT HOME WITH 
MY WIFE AND TWO UNDERAGE DAUGHTERS. 
 
FOR FIVE DAYS WE WERE CLOSED INSIDE OUR HOME, 
LISTENING TO THE SHOOTINGS AND THE GRENADES WITH 
WHICH THE CITY WAS BEING SYSTEMATICALLY DESTROYED. 
HIDDEN BEHIND OUR WINDOWS, WE WATCHED THE ARRIVAL OF 
TANKS AND BUSES FULL OF BLOOD-THIRSTY CHETNIKS FROM 
NEIGHBORING BIJELJINA, WHICH WAS ALREADY OCCUPIED, 
AND WHERE 1,000 MUSLIMS HAD BEEN KILLED. 
 
ON MAY 5 A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE YUGO ARMY IN A RADIO 
BROADCAST INSTRUCTED THE CITIZENS IN MY PART OF THE 
TOWN TO GO TO THE ARMY BARRACKS, FROM WHERE THE YUGO 
ARMY WOULD ORGANIZE AN EVACUATION TO A SAFER PLACE.

KNEW THAT THE SERBS HAD SPECIAL GROUPS USED TO 
MASSACRE CIVILIANS.  THESE GROUPS OF LUNATICS AND 
PSYCHOPATHS GO FROM APARTMENT TO APARTMENT, CELLAR TO 
CELLAR, AND, HIDDEN BEHIND THICK WALLS, COMMIT CRIMES 
AGAINST THE POWERLESS CIVILIANS.  UNDER THESE 
CIRCUMSTANCES, GOING TO THE YUGO ARMY BARRACKS SEEMED 
LIKE A BETTER CHANCE TO LEAVE THIS TOWN IN WHICH ONE 
COULD ALREADY SMELL DEATH. 
 
UPON OUR ARRIVAL AT THE BARRACKS, WE REALIZED WE WERE 
ALL IN A TRAP BECAUSE THERE, TOGETHER WITH THE 
REGULAR ARMY, WERE CHETNIKS AND OTHER SERBIAN REFUSE. 
THEY OFFERED TO GIVE US RIFLES IF WE WOULD FIGHT 
AGAINST OUR OWN PEOPLE FOR THE SERBIAN CAUSE.  THE 
MUSLIMS AND CROATS SILENTLY REFUSED.  OUR WIVES AND 
CHILDREN WERE PUT ON A BUS AND WERE TAKEN TO AN 
UNKNOWN DESTINATION.

AT GUNPOINT, WE MEN WERE ALSO PUT ON A BUS.  WE WERE 
TAKEN TO ONE OF BRCKO\'S PLACES OF EXECUTION, A 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION HALL IN THE CENTER OF THE TOWN. 
WE NOTICED, FROM THE PUDDLES OF BLOOD ON THE FLOOR, 
THAT THE EXECUTIONS HAD ALREADY BEGUN.  FOR THE 
COUPLE HUNDRED OF US WHO WERE LOCKED UP, THE LONG 
HOURS OF TORTURE BEGAN.  DURING THIS TIME, VARIOUS 
PEOPLE IN UNIFORM LOOKED US OVER, EXPECTING TO FIND 
CERTAIN IMPORTANT PEOPLE AMONG US.  ALONG WITH THE 
USUAL WEAPONS IN THEIR BELTS, THESE UNIFORMED PEOPLE 
ALSO CARRIED BIG KITCHEN KNIVES.  WE KNEW THEIR 
PURPOSE AND EXPECTED THE WORST. 
 
THE TORTURE STARTED WITH ORAL THREATS.  THE SERBS 
WOULD SING SONGS DEDICATED TO DRAZA MIHAJLOVIC, THE 
CHETNIK LEADER IN WORLD WAR TWO.  SOME OF US, 
THREATENED BY EXECUTION, HAD TO LEARN THE SONGS BY 
HEART.  THE SERBS ENJOYED OUR FEAR AND MADE FUN OF 
US.  THEN THEIR BEARDED LEADER STARTED TO RECITE THE 
ORTHODOX LORD\'S PRAYER.  WE HAD TO LISTEN TO IT WHILE 
STANDING AND THEN END HIS CLOSING WORDS WITH AMIN 
(THE ORTHODOX AMEN). 
 
NEXT THE SERBS STARTED SLAPPING US, HITTING US WITH 
BOXES AND FEET.  WHEN THIS ENDED, THEY TOOK FOUR OF 
US OUT FOR EXECUTION.  WE WERE SELECTED BY RANKO 
CESIC, KNOWN PREVIOUSLY AS A CRIMINAL AND A VIOLENT 
PERSON.  I TRIED TALKING TO THE SERBS, EXPLAINING 
THAT I HAD COME TO THE BARRACKS WITH MY WIFE AND 
CHILDREN AFTER HEARING THE APPEAL OVER THE RADIO, BUT 
THEY DID NOT CARE.  THEY PUT ONE OF US (KIBE - A

HIM IN THE BACK WITH A MACHINE GUN. 
 
LOOKING AT THE HOLES IN HIS BACK, MY WHOLE LIFE 
PASSED IN FRONT OF MY EYES.  I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER 
SEE EITHER MY CHILDREN OR MY FAMILY AGAIN AND THAT 
ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME WAS DEFINITELY NOT A 
DREAM BUT A HORRID REALITY.  MY EYES CLOSED, I LOST 
CONSCIOUSNESS, AND MY BODY CRUMBLED ONTO PIECES OF 
GLASS.  MY FAINTING AWAKENED A BIT OF HUMANITY IN THE 
SERBS\' LEADER.  HE ORDERED THEM TO BRING ME BACK TO 
THE HALL, WHERE I COULD REST A LITTLE.  ONE OF THE 
SERBS TOOK SATISFACTION IN REMOVING MY GLASSES AND 
BREAKING THEM. 
 
THE OTHER THREE MEN WERE KILLED IN THE MOST CRUEL 
MANNER.  FIRST THEY WERE BEATEN IN AN ANOTHER ROOM 
AND LEFT TO RECOVER A LITTLE.  THEN THEY WERE TAKEN 
TO A COURTYARD WHERE WE HEARD THE WORST SOUNDS THAT A

HUMAN THROAT CAN PRODUCE.  WE HEARD THE DULL SLASHES 
OF KNIVES CUTTING INTO HUMAN FLESH.  THEN THE THREE 
MEN WERE HELD BY THEIR LEGS AND BEATEN WHILE AGAINST 
THE WALL OF THE BUILDING WHERE WE WERE IMPRISONED. 
WITH ABOUT TWENTY MORE SHOTS, THE SERBS ASSURED THE 
THREE MEN\'S DEATH. 
 
THE NEXT AFTERNOON, FOUR OF US MANAGED TO GET SOME 
SYMPATHY FROM ONE OF THE SERBIAN POLICEMEN.  HE LET 
US GET ON A BUS GOING TO BIJELJINA, ON WHICH THERE 
WAS A GROUP OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.  FROM THERE I 
LUCKILY MANAGED TO ESCAPE, EVEN FROM BIJELJINA, WHERE 
THE SERBIAN AUTHORITIES STILL TAKE PEOPLE FROM THEIR 
HOMES, USUALLY DURING THE NIGHT, WHO NEVER RETURN.  I 
MANAGED TO GET TO THE FREE PART OF CROATIA THROUGH 
HUNGARY AND SLOVENIA. 
 
ALL THAT I HAVE WRITTEN HERE CAN BE CONFIRMED BY 
THREE OTHER WITNESSES WHO ALSO MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM 
THAT HELL.  I THINK WE WERE LUCKY THAT WE WENT 
THROUGH ALL THIS IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THE SERBIAN 
OCCUPATION, WHILE THE SERBIAN KILLING MACHINERY WAS 
NOT SO WELL DEVELOPED YET.  I DO NOT KNOW THE DESTINY 
OF THE OTHERS WHO REMAINED THERE.  A FEW GYPSIES 
ACCEPTED THE SERBIAN OFFER TO JOIN THEIR ARMED FORCES 
AND THUS SAVED THEIR NECKS FROM THE CHETNIKS... 
 
I AM NOT SUCH A GREAT WITNESS SINCE I WITNESSED ONLY 
FOUR KILLINGS, OF WHICH THREE INDIVIDUALS I KNEW 
PERSONALLY.  THAT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR ME TO 
DISCOVER EVIL AND HELL.

TO SURRENDER.  A SERBIAN OFFICER NICKNAMED CIGO TOLD 
THE GROUP THE WHOLE VILLAGE HAD TWO HOURS TO 
SURRENDER.  CIGO WAS THE HEAD OF THE TANK REGIMENT 
WHICH ATTACKED KEVLJANI.  S.V. SAID HE SURRENDERED TO

VILLAGE WOULD BE SPARED.  HOWEVER, THE SERBIAN ARMY

5.  (U)  S.V. SAID HE WAS IN BUILDING NUMBER 11, IN A 
ROOM 15 BY 15 METERS LARGE.  HE BELIEVES OVER 450 MEN 
WERE FORCED INTO THE ROOM.  THE ROOM WAS TOO SMALL

SINGLE FILE BETWEEN SERBIAN GUARDS, WHO TRIPPED AND 
BEAT ALMOST EACH PRISONER AS HE RAN BY.  BENCHES AND 
TABLES BLOCKED THEIR PATH, AND, IF THE PRISONERS 
STUMBLED OVER THESE, THEY WERE BEATEN EVEN MORE.  A 
MEAL CONSISTED OF 90 G. OF BREAD AND MAYBE SOME SOUP 
BROTH OR A CABBAGE LEAF.  OFTEN, S.V. SAID, 24 TO 60 
HOURS WOULD PASS BETWEEN MEALS. 
 
6.  (U)  ON HIS 22ND DAY AT THE CAMP (AROUND JUNE 
18-19), S.V. WAS CALLED OUT OF THE ROOM AT 2 A.M.  HE 
WAS INTERROGATED BY ZDRAVKO GOVEDARICA, A SERBIAN 
FROM THE VILLAGE OF MRKONJIC GRAD, NEAR JAJCE, WHOM 
HE KNEW BEFORE THE WAR.  THE MAN WAS AN OFFICER, WITH 
THREE CHEVRON MARKS ON HIS UNIFORM, S.V. SAID.  S.V. 
WAS REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED ABOUT THE LOCATION OF A 
LARGE GUN CALLED A MITRALJEZ BREDA.  S.V. DENIED ANY 
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS GUN, AND CLAIMED THAT THE TO IN 
KEVLJANI NEVER OWNED SUCH A GUN.  THE KEVLJANI TO HAD 
SURRENDERED ALL THEIR WEAPONS TO CIGO, DURING THE 
SERBIAN ATTACK ON THEIR VILLAGE.

EVEN FEEL THE KNIFE AS HE WATCHED BLOOD POUR OUT OF 
HIS LEG. 
 
9.  (U)  THE GUARDS MADE HIM STAND UP, BUT S.V. 
PRETENDED TO FAINT.  THE GUARDS DID NOT BELIEVE HE 
FAINTED, AND FORCED S.V. UP AGAIN.  ON HIS THIRD 
ATTEMPT TO STAND, S.V. DID LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AS HE 
FELL ON HIS LEFT SIDE, WITH THE BROKEN RIBS.  THE 
GUARDS THREW WATER ON HIM TO WAKEN HIM.  THEY 
RETURNED HIS CLOTHES, AND S.V. WAS ABLE TO PULL ON 
HIS PANTS AND BOOTS BEFORE THEY WALKED HIM BACK TO A 
ROOM.  S.V. SAID HE WAS THE FIRST PRISONER IN OMARSKA 
TO BE RETURNED TO THE ROOMS AFTER A BEATING, AND NOT 
KILLED OR TAKEN TO THE SO-CALLED WHITE HOUSE.  S.V.

THESE SINKS.  THREE FAUCETS WORKED, SO IT WAS THE

S.V. GOT A PLACE UNDER ONE SINK.  THE STENCH WAS 
TERRIBLE, AS THE SINKS WERE USED AS TOILETS BY THE 
PRISONERS.  HE SLEPT 10 DAYS IN THIS PLACE.  THEN HE 
WAS MOVED ACROSS THE HALL TO THE SHOWER STALLS.  TWO 
PEOPLE SLEPT IN EACH STALL, ONE METER SQUARE.  S.V. 
SAID HE COULD ONLY STRETCH HIS LEGS IF HE EXTENDED 
THEM UP THE SIDE WALL.  HE STAYED HERE UNTIL EARLY

BEATEN WITH BATONS ON ALL HIS JOINTS, AND HIS LEGS 
BUCKLED UNDERNEATH HIM.  ONE GUARD BROUGHT A 
COCKROACH AND MADE S.V. EAT IT FROM HIS HAND.  THIS 
GUARD THEN CLAIMED THAT S.V. BIT HIM.  THREE OF THE 
SOLDIERS BEAT S.V. VICIOUSLY ON HIS CHEST, BACK AND

STOOD ON HIS FACE AND RUBBED IT WITH HIS BOOT INTO 
THE FLOOR.  WHEN S.V. WAS SENT TO THE BATHROOM TO

ON AUGUST 12, INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS ARRIVED AT 
OMARSKA.  THE SERBS TOLD THE JOURNALISTS THAT THE 
PRISONERS THERE HAD BEEN HELD FOR TWO TO THREE WEEKS 
FOR INTERROGATION.  THE JOURNALISTS HAD BROUGHT ICRC 
REGISTRATION CARDS AND REGISTERED ALL THE PRISONERS. 
S.V. SAID THE REPORTERS TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE NOW 
CITIZENS OF THE U.N.  THE PRISONERS WERE ALLOWED TO 
SLEEP ON THE BEDS FOR THREE NIGHTS.  ON AUGUST 21, 
ALL THE REMAINING PRISONERS IN OMARSKA WERE TAKEN TO 
MANJACA CAMP.  S.V. SAID THAT THE MEN WERE NO LONGER 
BEATEN REGULARLY AND SEVERELY FROM THAT POINT AND 
THAT THE ICRC CAME REGULARLY TO CHECK ON THEIR 
CONDITION AND BRING THEM FOOD.

2.  WE ARE FRANKLY APPALLED BY THE THRICE-REPEATED 
CLAIM IN REF A THAT THE EVENTS IN AND AROUND PROZOR 
OVER 6 WEEKS AGO CONSTITUTE HARD EVIDENCE OF PAST AND 
LIKELY FUTURE CROATIAN ETHNIC CLEANSING IN BOSNIA. 
FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT, THIS PERSISTENT ALLEGATION 
IS DANGEROUSLY DISTRACTING.  AND PLAINLY INACCURATE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

IN FACT.  END SUMMARY COMMENT. 
 
3.  WE ARE TROUBLED BY THE IMPLICATION THROUGHOUT 
REF A THAT THE FLIGHT OF ANY NUMBER OF PERSONS OF ANY 
ETHNIC GROUP IN B-H UNDER ANY ACTUAL OR FEARED THREAT 
FROM MEMBERS OF ANY OTHER ETHNIC GROUP CONSTITUTES, 
IPSO FACTO, \"ETHNIC CLEANSING.\"  TO APPLY THIS VERY 
EVOCATIVE TERM IN SUCH A MANNER IN OUR VIEW DEBASES 
ITS CONSIDERABLE USEFULNESS.  THROUGHOUT THE LONG, 
WRENCHING SAGA OF YUGOSLAVIA\'S BREAKUP, THE LEAP FROM 
SIMPLE RECOGNITION THAT NO SIDE IS WITHOUT BLAME TO 
THE POLICY-STULTIFYING CONCLUSION OF VIRTUAL MORAL 
EQUIVALENCE HAS BEEN MADE FAR TOO OFTEN AND TOO 
QUICKLY.  AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND, WE LAUD THE FACT 
THAT USG SPOKESMEN HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR 
ABOUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR \"ETHNIC CLEANSING\" IN 
BOSNIA.  AND WE THINK THE USG CAN TAKE PRIDE IN THE 
LEADING ROLE IT HAS PLAYED BOTH IN PUSHING FOR A WAR 
CRIMES TRIBUNAL TO IDENTIFY THE GUILTY (ON ANY SIDE) 
AND IN ASSEMBLING EVIDENCE TO ASSIST IN THAT PROCESS. 
CONTINUATION OF THIS USG CLEAR-HEADEDNESS WILL BE 
VITAL, WE BELIEVE, IF WE ARE TO COUNTER REPORTED 
SIGNALS FROM LORD OWEN, AMONG OTHERS, THAT TALK OF 
WAR CRIMES TRIBUNALS MAY NEED TO BE MUTED IN THE 
INTEREST OF FOSTERING POLITICAL COMPROMISE IN B-H 
INVOLVING POTENTIALLY GUILTY PARTIES. 
 
4.  BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US, IT IS 
THE CONCLUSION OF ALL INTERESTED ELEMENTS OF THIS 
EMBASSY THAT CROATIAN FORCES IN BOSNIA HAVE NOT 
ENGAGED IN ETHNIC CLEANSING -- EITHER AS A MATTER OF

ARGUE THAT CERTAIN CROATIAN ELEMENTS, NOTABLY HOS, 
DID NOT ENGAGE IN ISOLATED CRIMES AS HEINOUS AS SOME 
OF THOSE ROUTINELY COMMITTED BY BOSNIAN SERB FORCES. 
BUT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF CROATIAN FORCES ENGAGING 
IN ETHNIC CLEANSING AS THAT TERM IS NOW USEFULLY 
APPLIED TO THE CONCLUSIVELY-DOCUMENTED BOSNIAN SERB 
PRACTICE OF:  BOMBARDING A VILLAGE FROM AFAR, ENTERING 
IT IN A SHOWY DISPLAY OF MILITARY FORCE, IMMEDIATELY 
COMMITTING SUCH TERRORIZING PUBLIC ATROCITIES AS 
SLITTING A DOZEN OR SO PERSONS\' THROATS ON THEIR

OF THE SERBIAN DEATH CAMP SURVIVORS WILL KNOW THAT 
THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLE.

5.  CULPABILITY FOR THE EVENTS IN NOVI TRAVNIK AND 
PROZOR IN MID-OCTOBER IS DISPUTED.  THE CROATS CLAIM 
TO HAVE RADIO INTERCEPT \"PROOF\" OF ORDERS GIVEN BY 
RADICAL MUSLIM ELEMENTS TO KILL CROATS.  THERE ARE 
OTHER REPORTS OF BATTLE CRIES FROM CROATIAN ELEMENTS 
TO KILL MUSLIMS.  AND THE AFTERMATH INDICATES THAT 
MUSLIM CIVILIANS DID SUFFER DISPROPORTIONATELY. 
NOTWITHSTANDING WHO IS MORE GUILTY FOR THIS BOUT OF 
CROATIAN/MUSLIM MADNESS, BOTH SIDES ARE PAINFULLY 
AWARE THAT IT CONTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO THE FALL OF 
JAJCE.  IN THE WAKE OF THAT TRAGEDY, IZETBEGOVIC AND 
TUDJMAN SAY THEY HAVE CLEARED THE AIR, AND CROATIAN 
AND MUSLIM FORCES APPEAR TO HAVE REESTABLISHED A 
MODICUM OF CIVILITY AND COOPERATION IN MILITARY 
ACTIONS.  ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT AWARE OF SUBSEQUENT 
\"PROZORS,\" NONE OF THIS IS TO SAY THAT THERE WON\'T BE 
OTHER CROATIAN/MUSLIM SKIRMISHES FROM WHICH MUSLIMS 
AND/OR CROATS MAY FLEE.  IT IS TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT 
BY NO REASONABLE STRETCH OF MIND OR LANGUAGE DOES 
\"PROZOR\" CONSTITUTE EVIDENCE OF CROATIAN ETHNIC 
CLEANSING, LET ALONE A LIKELIHOOD OF \"CONTINUED\" 
CROATIAN ETHNIC CLEANSING.

2.  AT HIS DECEMBER 1 PRESS CONFERENCE, PRESIDENT      . 
TUDJMAN SAID IT IS TOO EARLY TO DISCUSS PROLONGATION 
OF THE UNPROFOR MANDATE.  \"WE HAVE PUT FORTH OUR 
REQUESTS (TO UNPROFOR).  ...IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO 
DISCUSS WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF 
UNPROFOR\'S MANDATE.  IN ANY CASE, CROATIA IS NOT 
WILLING TO PROLONG UNPROFOR\'S MANDATE WHILE IT IS NOT 
FULFILLING ITS TASKS.\"  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD 
MET CONFIDENTIALLY WITH GENEVA NEGOTIATORS VANCE AND 
OWEN IN CROATIA OVER THE NOV 28-29 WEEKEND TO DISCUSS 
UNPROFOR AND THE CONTINUING CRISIS IN THE FORMER 
YUGOSLAVIA, BUT HE PROVIDED NO DETAILS.  LATER, HE 
SAID VANCE AND OWEN HAD TOLD THE SERBS IN SECTOR EAST 
AND KNIN THAT THE SO-CALLED KRAJINA IS PART OF 
CROATIA AND THAT SOLUTIONS TO THE QUESTION OF SERBIAN 
MINORITIES MUST BE FOUND WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF 
CROATIAN LAW.  REPRESENTATIVES OF UNPROFOR, ACCORDING 
TO THE PRESIDENT, HAVE CONCLUDED THAT \"THE VANCE PLAN 
HAS BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION\" BY SERBIAN REFUSAL TO 
COOPERATE AND THAT \"STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HAVE 
UNPROFOR IMPLEMENT IT.\"

\"OF COURSE, THE WORLD IS ENGAGED A LITTLE BIT, BUT IN

5.  THE PRESIDENT\'S PRESCRIPTION FOR RESOLVING THE 
CONFLICTS IN CROATIA AND B-H WAS A COMBINATION OF 
CONTINUED INTERNATIONAL HELP AND DOMESTIC MEASURES. 
HE SAID THE MOST THAT COULD BE EXPECTED FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS THE SECURITY COUNCIL\'S 
SANCTIONING DEPLOYMENT OF A LARGER PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
\"WITH THE PURPOSE OF PREVENTING FURTHER AGGRESSION,

TERMINATE FURTHER AGGRESSION.\"

ATTENTION FROM ZAGREB POLICE OFFICIALS.  NO 
DETAILS OF THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY HAVE BEEN MADE 
PUBLIC.  COLLEAGUES FROM THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC 
UNION, A NEW POLITICAL PARTY WITH WHICH KRIVOKUCA 
WAS ASSOCIATED, HAVE ASKED FOR A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF POLITICAL MOTIVES 
WERE INVOLVED.  THE SPLIT WEEKLY \"NEDJELJNA 
DALMACIJA\" RAISED THE QUESTION ON DECEMBER 24 OF 
WHETHER KRAJINA SERBS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE 
CULPRITS.  KRIVOKUCA, A CROATIAN OF SERBIAN 
NATIONALITY, REPORTEDLY HAD SOUGHT UNPROFOR 
COOPERATION TO HELP RESTART POLITICAL CONTACTS 
WITH SERBIAN MODERATES IN THE SERBIAN-CONTROLLED 
PARTS OF THE UNPAS.

3.  THE ZADAR CITY ASSEMBLY HAS COMPLAINED THAT 
UNPROFOR FAILED TO ARRANGE THE VISIT OF CROATIAN 
DISPLACED PERSONS TO THEIR VILLAGES AND CHURCHES 
IN UN-CONTROLEED SECTOR SOUTH.  UNPROFOR 
- 
REPORTEDLY ARRANGED VISITS TO ONLY THREE LOCATIONS 
IN ALL OF SECTOR SOUTH.  UNPROFOR ALSO 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT, OF THE SEVERAL HUNDRED CATHOLIC 
CHURCHES WHICH USED TO EXIST IN SECTOR SOUTH, ONLY 
THREE REMAIN, ONE EACH IN OBROVAC, BENKOVAC, AND 
NOVIGRAD.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. AN EXPATRIATE STAFFER FROM UNHCR\'S BANJA LUKA 
OFFICE (STRICTLY PROTECT) DESCRIBED FOR US THE 
WORSENING SITUATION IN NORTHWEST BOSNIA DEC. 30. 
THE UNHCR STAFFER SAID THE LOCAL SERBIAN FORCES HAD 
INTENSIFIED THEIR HARASSMENT OF BOTH BOSNIAN MUSLIMS 
AND CROATS SINCE EARLY DECEMBER.  IN BANJA LUKA, 
UNHCR AND ICRC STAFFERS SEEING AND HEARING NUMEROUS 
ARMED SERBIAN GROUPS SHOOTING UP HOUSES, APARTMENT 
BUILDINGS, AND STORES AT RANDOM, KILLING AND WOUNDING 
PEOPLE OF ALL AGES EVERYDAY.  THE SERBS ALSO WERE 
LOOTING HOMES AND STORES AND DESTROYING MOST 
ABANDONED MUSLIM AND CROAT BUILDINGS.  THE VIOLENCE 
AND DESTRUCTION IS MUCH WORSE IN THE SURROUNDING 
COUNTRYSIDE.  UNHCR-ZAGREB RECALLED ITS EXPAT STAFF 
FROM BANJA LUKA A FEW DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS FOR A 
TEMPORARY, BUT INDEFINITE, PERIOD.  ALTHOUGH NO RPT 
NO CREDIBLE, SPECIFIC DEATH THREATS HAD BEEN MADE 
AGAINST THE EXPAT STAFF, INDIVIDUAL ARMED SERBS HAVE 
BEEN MORE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH SINCE MID-DECEMBER, 
ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN.  A SERB COLONEL 
RECENTLY JOKED THAT IF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
DECIDED WESTERN FORCES SHOULD ENFORCE THE NO FLY 
RESOLUTION AND ATTACKED THE AIRFIELD NEAR BANJA LUKA 
OR OTHER MILITARY TARGETS, THE SERBS HAD 60,000 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SERIOUS.  END SUMMARY.

3.  ON DEC. 30, 1992, AN EXPATRIATE STAFFER FROM 
UNHCR\'S BANJA LUKA OFFICE (STRICTLY PROTECT) MET AT 
UNHCR ZAGREB HEADQUARTERS WITH TDY POLOFF AND HEAD OF 
OFDA DART TEAM .  THE EXPAT HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR 
AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND 
AN AMERICAN PVO IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE STAFFER SAID 
THE FOUR MONTHS SHE WORKED IN BANJA LUKA (SEPTEMBER - 
DECEMBER) SEEMED LIKE FOUR YEARS.  \"IT WAS MUCH WORSE 
THAN THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR.\"  ACKNOWLEDGING 
DISAGREEMENT WITH USG POLICIES IN EL SALVADOR, THE 
UNHCR STAFFER SAID THE SERB FORCES\' KILLING, RANDOM 
VIOLENCE AND VICIOUS TREATMENT OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS AND 
CROATS IN THE SO-CALLED SERBIAN REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA 
WAS \"EVEN WORSE THAN THE ATROCITIES OF THE SALVADORAN 
DEATH SQUADS.\"

4.  THE UNHCR STAFFER SAID THE SERBIAN FORCES SEEMED 
TO HAVE REDUCED THEIR KILLING AND MISTREATMENT OF 
MUSLIMS AND CROATS IN SEPTEMBER FOR SOME UNKNOWN 
REASON.  SHE SPECULATED THAT THEY HAD TEMPORARILY 
BACKED OFF AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL OUTCRY AT SERBIAN 
MASSACRES AND DEATH CAMPS DURING THE SUMMER AND EARLY 
AUTUMN.  HOWEVER, IN EARLY NOVEMBER THE SERBS RESUMED 
THEIR PREVIOUS SEVERE HARASSMENT OF BOTH ETHNIC 
GROUPS.  THE KILLING, VIOLENCE, AND DESTRUCTION 
INCREASED FURTHER IN EARLY DECEMBER.  THE NON-SERBIAN 
POPULATION IS THOROUGHLY TERRORIZED, AS ARE SOME LONG 
RESIDENT SERBS WHO HAVE REFUSED TO BE \"MOBILIZED\" 
AGAINST THE MUSLIMS AND CROATS.  WHILE THE STAFFER 
HAD NOT RPT NOT HEARD OF ANY NEW LARGE SCALE 
MASSACRES SINCE SEPTEMBER, THE VARIOUS ARMED SERBIAN 
GROUPS KILLED OR WOUNDED PEOPLE SINGLY OR IN SMALL 
NUMBERS EVERY DAY, OFTEN SEEMINGLY AT RANDOM.  THE 
VIOLENCE WAS MUCH WORSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AROUND 
BANJA LUKA, ESPECIALLY WEST AND NORTH OF TOWN.  UNHCR 
HAD ONLY THREE EXPAT AND NINE LOCAL EMPLOYEES IN 
BANJA LUKA WITH ONLY A FEW VEHICLES, SO THEY COULD 
NOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE CASUALTIES THROUGHOUT THE 
REGION.  THE STAFFER SAID ICRC HAD NINE EXPATS AND 15 
LOCAL EMPLOYEES AND A NUMBER OF VEHICLES IN BANJA 
LUKA, BUT SHE DOUBTED ICRC HAD SUFFICIENT FREEDOM OF 
MOVEMENT TO ESTIMATE CASUALTIES EITHER.

UNHCR EXPATS BACK FROM BANJA LUKA A FEW DAYS BEFORE 
CHRISTMAS FOR A \"TEMPORARY PERIOD.\"  THE BANJA LUKA 
OFFICE REMAINS OFFICIALLY OPEN AND LOCAL STAFF 
CONTINUE TRYING TO WORK.  THE EXPAT STAFF HAS HAD 
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULTY WORKING OVER THE LAST 
TWO MONTHS.  FOR EXAMPLE, SERBIAN \"COLONELS\" IN BANJA 
LUKA TOLD THE UNHCR STAFF THAT THEY DID NOT NEED 
PERMISSION TO LEAVE TOWN TO OBSERVE HOW UNHCR- 
PROVIDED FOOD WAS BEING DISTRIBUTED OR MISUSED.  BUT 
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN, SERBIAN GUARDS AT A CHECKPOINT 
WOULD REFUSE THEM PERMISSION TO PROCEED AT ALL OR 
ONLY AFTER LONG, NASTY ARGUMENTS AND INCREASINGLY 
FREQUENT WAVING AROUND OF RIFLES AND PISTOLS.  THE 
STAFFER SAID THAT THE THREE EXPATS BECAME VERY 
FRUSTRATED AS IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO 
MEANINGFUL WORK, EVEN ON AN IRREGULAR BASIS.  MORE 
IMPORTANTLY, SERBIAN \"HASSLING\" OF UNHCR STAFFERS WAS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SERBIAN \"SOLDIERS\" DID NOT SEEM TO BE FOLLOWING THE 
STAFFERS AROUND, BUT ARMED SERBS WERE ALWAYS AROUND. 
NO SPECIFIC DEATH THREATS HAD BEEN MADE AGAINST THEM, 
BUT IT WAS CLEARLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN IN EARLY 
DECEMBER.  THE UNHCR ZAGREB CHIEF WILL DECIDE IN 
JANUARY WHETHER TO SEND THE EXPATS BACK TO BANJA 
LUKA.  MEANWHILE, THEY ARE TAKING WELL-EARNED LEAVE 
AND GETTING MEDICA ATTENTION FOR INTESTINAL 
PROBLEMS.  THE STAFFER EXPECTS ICRC TO TRY TO REMAIN 
IN BANJA LUKA.

SERBS READY FOR MORE WAR CRIMES

6.  A SERBIAN \"OFFICER\" AT BANJA LUKA TOLD THE UNHCR 
STAFFER THAT THEY WOULD COUNTER THREATS OF U.S. OR 
OTHER AIR STRIKES ON THE AIRFIELD NEAR BANJA LUKA OR 
OTHER MILITARY TARGETS BY DEPLOYING SOME OF THE 
60,000 MUSLIMS AND CROATS IN AND AROUND BANJA LUKA AS 
A HUMAN SHIELD.  THE STAFFER IS CONVINCED THE OFFICER 
WAS DEADLY SERIOUS.

ARREST OF MODERATE SERBS GOES ON

MORE FORCES BUT POORER DISCIPLINE

8.  THE STAFFER SAID THAT IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS 
THERE HAS BEEN A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF 
SERBIAN MILITARY AND PARA-MILITARY PERSONNEL IN BANJA 
LUKA.  THE NEWLY ARRIVED \"SOLDIERS\" OFTEN SEEM TO 
OPERATE AT CROSS-PURPOSES, AND SOME HEADQUARTERS AND 
UNITS ARE FEUDING WITH OTHERS.  THE MEN WEAR A 
VARIETY OF UNIFORMS.  GUESSING FROM SHOULDER PATCHES 
(WHICH MANY DO NOT WEAR), NEW MEN ARE FROM ABOUT 12 
MAJOR UNITS OR ORGANIZATIONS, APPARENTLY INCLUDING 
MANY WITH ADMIN OR SUPPORT-TYPE ACTIVITIES. 
DISCIPLINE IN MANY GROUPS IS POOR AND GETTING WORSE.

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02862  04 OF 05  311836Z 
THE PARA-MILITARY GROUPS ARE THE WORST AND ARE 
GETTING MORE NUMEROUS AS SOME \"ARMY\" UNITS MOVE OUT 
OF TOWN NEARER THE AIRFIELD OR TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN 
AND WESTERN FRONTS.  MANY OF THE NEW GROUPS 
APPARENTLY ARE FROM SERBIA.  IT IS DANGEROUS JUST TO 
WALK DOWN THE STREET OR EVEN BE IN A BUILDING.  THE 
SERBS ALSO ARE DRAFTING BOSNIAN SERB POLICEMEN OUT OF 
THE TOWN AND SURROUNDING AREAS, SO CRIME RATES ARE 
RISING.  THE POLICEMEN AT LEAST PROTECTED SOME OF THE 
SERBIAN CIVILIANS, NOW THEY TOO ARE BEING VICTIMIZED 
BY THEIR \"PROTECTORS.\"

OPPOSITION TO THE SERBIAN FORCES AS FAR AS THE UNHCR 
KNEW.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS SMALL SKIRMISHES AND 
FIREFIGHTS OUTSIDE OF BANJA LUKA, ESPECIALLY IN THE 
WEST, THAT ADD TO THE TOLL OF DEAD AND WOUNDED AND 
DISPLACED.  LOCAL SERBIAN FORCES CLAIMED \"MUSLIM 
FUNDAMENTALISTS AND MERCENARIES\" ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ATROCITIES .  SERBIAN OFFICERS ARE STILL SHOWING 
VISITING FOREIGN OFFICIALS AND JOURNALISTS GRUESOME 
PICTURES OF BUCKETS OF CHOPPED OFF HEADS AND PILES OF 
HEADS AND OTHER GORY SCENES WHICH THEY CLAIM ARE THE 
RESULT OF MUSLIM ATTACKS ON SERBS.

2.  REF A\'S RE-DRAFT OF THE CROATIA HUMAN RIGHTS 
REPORT CONSTITUTES, IN OUR VIEW, A MAJOR AND AS YET 
UNSUBSTANTIATED REORIENTATION OF THE DRAFT REPORT WE 
SUBMITTED IN REF B. 
 
3.  IN LIGHT OF ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED IN CROATIA IN 
1992, IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE BY PICKING AND CHOOSING TO 
\"DOCUMENT\" VIRTUALLY ANY CASE ONE WERE INCLINED TO 
MAKE REGARDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE OF THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT.  OVERALL BALANCE WILL BE CRITICAL 
TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS YEAR\'S REPORT.  IN OUR 
DRAFT WE SOUGHT CAREFULLY TO STRIKE A BALANCE WHICH 
ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN 
THIS COUNTRY OVER THE PAST YEAR. 
4.  IN PARAGRAPH 11 OF REF A WE ARE ADVISED TO MAKE A 
\"SPECIAL EFFORT\" TO DOCUMENT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BY 
THE CROATS -- OTHERWISE THE STRONG U.S. INDICTMENT OF 
SERBIAN ABUSES IN SERBIA AND BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA WILL 
SEEM LESS CREDIBLE.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE 
MISUNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THIS REQUEST, BUT, FOR 
THE RECORD, WE WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE 
TAKING SUCH A CALCULATED APPROACH TO DESCRIBING 
CROATIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE.  MORE PLAINLY 
PUT, WE DON\'T THINK CROATIA\'S AND SERBIA\'S 1992 HUMAN 
RIGHTS REPORTS SHOULD BE DRAFTED OR CONSIDERED \"IN 
TANDEM.\" 
 
5.  THIS FORMERLY EVACUATED MISSION HAD ALMOST NO 
FILES FROM THE FIRST HALF OF 1992 AND EXPERIENCED AN 
ALMOST TOTAL CHANGEOVER OF PERSONNEL LAST SUMMER. 
YET WE FULLY ACKNOWLEDGED, AND WE INCLUDED IN OUR

DRAFT, SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS SHORTCOMINGS AND EVEN 
ALLEGATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, IN TERRITORY 
CONTROLLED BY THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1992.  IF 
THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO AUGMENT WHAT WE INCLUDED IN 
OUR DRAFT WITH HARD EVIDENCE WHICH CASTS CROATIA\'S 
HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT, THIS 
SHOULD OBVIOUSLY BE DONE.  BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO STICK 
WITH THE FACTS AND KEEP OUR FOCUS ON CROATIA. 
 
6.  MANY OBSERVERS OF THE CROATIAN SCENE, INCLUDING 
HARSH CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT, WOULD TEND TO 
DISMISS A GRATUITOUSLY SEVERE REPORT AS MERELY 
REFLECTING A DEEP-SEEDED STATE DEPARTMENT BIAS 
AGAINST CROATS.  WE HERE DO WHAT WE CAN TO CORRECT 
THIS UNFORTUNATE MISPERCEPTION.  BUT A HUMAN RIGHTS 
REPORT OF REF A\'S ORIENTATION RUNS THE RISK OF BEING 
REJECTED OUT OF HAND.  THIS IS NOT/NOT AN ARGUMENT 
FOR NOT TAKING A TOUGH, OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THIS 
VERY-IMPERFECT GOVERNMENT\'S HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE, 
BUT WE SHOULD LIMIT OURSELVES TO THAT.

(JNA) AGAINST CROATIAN TOWNS AND CITIES IN ORDER TO 
DESTROY THE FLEDGLING CROATIAN STATE OR LEAVE IT 
CRIPPLED INDEFINITELY.  THEY ESTABLISHED CONTROL OVER 
A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE CROATS OF SERBIAN NATIONALITY 
WERE PREDOMINANT AS WELL AS OVER AREAS WHERE SERBS 
HAD BEEN IN A MINORITY.  THE JNA WAS ASSISTED IN THIS 
EFFORT BY PARAMILITARY FORCES WHO INVADED FROM SERBIA 
AND FROM MONTENEGRO AND BY LOCAL SERBIAN IRREGULARS. 
THESE UNITS WERE OFTEN ORGANIZED AND LED BY REGULAR 
JNA OFFICERS OR THEIR SURROGATES AND ALL WERE 
DIRECTLY SUPPLIED WITH WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION BY THE 
JNA.// 
 
10.  REF A, NOTE ONE: CROATIA DID NOT ISSUE A FORMAL 
DECLARATION OF WAR.  RESTRICTIONS/EMERGENCY POWERS 
INCLUDED LARGELY CURFEWS, BLACKOUTS, AND SIMILAR 
CIVIL DEFENSE MEASURES.  MOST OF THESE, INSTITUTED 
INFORMALLY OR AT LOCAL LEVELS, HAVE LONG SINCE CEASED 
IN AREAS NOT STILL UNDER BOMBARDMENT FROM SERBIAN 
FORCES IN BOSNIA.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE CURFEW IN 
DUBROVNIK WAS LIFTED BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND WILL NOT BE 
REINSTATED. 
 
11.  PARA 6, SENTENCE TWO: THIS IS INACCURATE.  THE 
AREAS OVER WHICH CROATIAN AUTHORITY IS TO BE 
REESTABLISHED UNDER THE VANCE PLAN WERE NOT AND STILL 
ARE NOT SOLELY \"SERB-INHABITED.\"  SECTOR WEST IS NOT 
EVEN LARGELY SERBIAN-CONTROLLED.  NOR ARE SERBS THE

12.  REF A, NOTE TWO: WITHDRAWAL OF JNA UNITS WAS 
SUPPOSEDLY COMPLETED IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER. 
HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE SOLDIERS IN JNA UNITS STAYED 
ON I SERBIAN-OCCUPIED PARTS OF CROATIA (WHAT BECAME 
THE UNPAS) AND \"CONVERTED\" TO THE SO-CALLED \"POLICE 
FORCE\" OR \"SPECIAL POLICE.\"  IN ADDITION, JNA UNITS 
CONTINUED TO OCCUPY THE PREVLAKA PENINSULA AND REGION 
AROUND DUBROVNIK LONG AFTER THEY HAD AGREED WITH UN 
NEGOTIATORS TO DEPART.  THE LAST JNA UNITS LEFT ONLY 
IN THE FIRST WEEK OF NOVEMBER. 
 
13.  PARA 6, LAST SENTENCE: THIS IS THE FIRST 
REFERENCE OF MANY IN REF A TO THE \"RSK,\" AN ENTITY 
WHICH NO COUNTRY RECOGNIZES.  IT IS NOT AN 
APPELLATION USED BY ANYONE IN CROATIA OUTSIDE OF THE 
UNPAS, INCLUDING CROATIAN SERBS.  IT HAS NO LEGAL 
STANDING AND NO GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURES WORTHY OF THE 
NAME.  ITS SO-CALLED OFFICIALS ARE IN MANY CASES 
PERSONALLY PERSECUTING NOT ONLY CROATS AND HUNGARIANS 
AND OTHER MINORITIES BUT ALSO MODERATE SERBS AS 
WELL.  THROUGHOUT THIS REPORT, \"RSK\" SHOULD BE 
REPLACED WITH, AS APPROPRIATE, \"THE UNITED NATIONS 
PROTECTED AREAS,\" \"THE UNPAS,\" OR, WHERE NECESSARY, 
\"THE UNPA SERBS.\"

WAS DETAINED AND RELEASED TWICE BY THE ETHNIC SERBIAN

INTERNATIONAL NEWS MEDIA HAVE DETAILED THE SPECIFIC 
ACTIVITIES OF SERBIAN EXTREMISTS IN THE UNPAS.  IN 
SECTOR EAST, SERBIAN PARAMILITARIES, INCLUDING THUGS 
FROM SERBIA WHO WORK FOR THE TERRORIST ARKAN, FORCE 
THEIR WAY INTO HOUSES FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAKING A 
\"CENSUS\" OF PEOPLE AND BELONGINGS.  NON-SERBS, 
INCLUDING HUNGARIANS AND SLOVAKS, ARE THEN PRESSURED 
BY PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION TO SIGN OVER THEIR PROPERTY 
AND LEAVE.  IN ISOLATED HOMESTEADS, GUNMEN WALK 
THROUGH THE TARGETED FARMYARDS SHOOTING AT WINDOWS 
AND PEOPLE IN THE HOUSES.  CREDIBLE REPORTS FROM 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS HAVE DOCUMENTED FORCIBLE 
ENTRY INTO HOMES AND THEN THE MURDER OR ASSAULT OF 
THE OCCUPANTS, MOSTLY OLD WOMEN AND MEN.  MURDERS OF 
MOSTLY ELDERLY CROATS TAKE PLACE IN SECTOR SOUTH ON 
AN ALMOST WEEKLY BASIS.

NIGHT, HAVE NOT BEEN CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFIED.  IT IS

CALLED ON FOREIGN MINISTER GRANIC JANUARY 13 TO 
DISCUSS ASSISTANCE TO THE PROSECUTOR FOR THE WAR 
CRIMES TRIBUNAL.  HE LEFT A COPY OF THE TALKING 
POINTS IN THE REFTEL. 
 
3.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THE NEED FOR ASSISTANCE 
IN THE AREAS OF IDENTIFICATION AND INTERROGATION OF 
WITNESSES, AND APPREHENSION OF SUSPECTED PERPETRATORS, 
NOTING THAT CROATIA ALMOST CERTAINLY HAS ONE OF THE 
LARGEST CONCENTRATIONS OF POTENTIAL WITNESSES TO WAR 
CRIMES COMMITTED IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00023  031858Z 
 
4.  GRANIC REPLIED THAT CROATIA WILL GIVE \"VERY 
STRONG SUPPORT\" TO THE WORK OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
CRIMES TRIBUNAL.  HE STATED THAT, AT THE MOMENT, 
INFORMATION ON WAR CRIMES IS SCATTERED AMONG VARIOUS 
ORGANIZATIONS.  GRANIC MENTIONED THE LEADING ROLE 
PLAYED TO DATE BY DR. IVICA KOSTAVIC, DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER AND CROATIAN AMBASSADOR FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. 
HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR WAR 
CRIMES HEADED BY DR. (AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT) 
VUKOVIC AS WELL AS SEVERAL PRIVATE GROUPS HAD BEEN 
ESPECIALLY ACTIVE IN THIS AREA. 
 
5.  ASKED IF CROATIA HAD ANY PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE THE 
INFORMATION ON HAND AND DESIGNATE A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL 
AS COORDINATOR ON WAR CRIMES ISSUES, GRANIC REPLIED 
THAT HE WOULD BE DISCUSSING THE MATTER WITH KOSTOVIC 
\"WHO IS THE ONE WHO KNOWS BEST.\"  HE PROMISED TO 
PROVIDE US WITH A LIST OF PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS BY 
THE END OF THE WEEK. 
 
6.  WITH RESPECT TO IDENTIFYING AND DETAINING 
SUSPECTED WAR CRIMINALS, INCLUDING POSSIBLY CROATS, 
GRANIC REPLIED THAT CROATIA WAS IN PRONCIPLE PREPARED 
TO COOPERATE BUT THAT HE WANTED TO EXAMINE OUR POINTS 
IN MORE DETAIL AND WOULD WOULD GIVE AN OFFICIAL REPLY 
IN WRITING BY THE END OF THE WEEK.  WHEN IT WAS 
POINTED OUT THAT AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT WOULD LIKELY 
RAISE THESE ISSUES DURING HER VISIT TO CROATIA, 
GRANIC STATED THAT THE GOC WOULD BE READY TO REPLY TO 
HER QUESTIONS ON THIS SUBJECT.

GRANIC TOLD AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH THAT THE PLANNED 
\"LONG VACATION\" TO AUSTRALIA BY THE \"PRESIDENT\" OF 
THE SO-CALLED \"REPUBLIC OF HERCEG-BOSNA,\" MATE BOBAN, 
HAD BEEN CANCELLED BECAUSE BOBAN HAD BEEN DENIED A 
VISA.  WE LATER CONTACTED THE AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY IN 
VIENNA AND WERE TOLD BY FIRST SECRETARY MARK HIGGIE 
THAT BOBAN HAD BEEN DESIGNATED A \"CONTROVERSIAL 
VISITOR\" BY THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC 
AFFAIRS ON THE BASIS THAT HIS VISIT \"DID NOT MEET 
PUBLIC INTEREST CRITERIA.\"  SPECIFICALLY, HIGGIE SAID 
THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FELT THAT BOBAN\'S 
VISIT COULD POTENTIALLY UPSET ETHNIC SERBS AND 
MUSLIMS FROM THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA CURRENTLY RESIDING 
IN AUSTRALIA. 
 
3.  HIGGIE STATED THAT VISAS HAD BEEN DENIED ON 
SIMILAR GROUNDS TO DOBROSLAV PARAGA, PRESIDENT OF THE 
CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHTS, AND BOSNIAN SERB \"VICE 
PRESIDENT\" BILJANA PLAVSIC.  HE ADDED THAT THE VISA 
TO BOBAN WAS DENIED, IN PART, TO BALACE THE EARLIER 
REFUSAL OF PLAVSIC.  HE ALSO COMMENTED THAT HAD BOBAN 
APPLIED A YEAR EARLIER, BEFORE THE MUSLIM-CROAT 
CONFLICT AND ENSUING VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, HIS 
APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN FAVORABLY RECEIVED. 
 
4.  ACTION REQUEST:  GRANIC SAID THAT BOBAN STILL 
HOPED TO VISIT THE U.S. FOR HIS \"LONG VACATION.\"  HE 
ASKED, \"OFF THE RECORD\" WHETHER WE COULD TELL HIM 
\"OFF THE RECORD\" WHETHER THE VISA APPLICATION WOULD 
BE FAVORABLY RECEIVED.  NOTE:  BOBAN WAS GIVEN AN A-1 
TDY VISA WITH 12 MONTHS VALIDITY LAST FEBRUARY TO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

ATTEND THE PEACE TALKS IN NEW YORK.  PLEASE PROVIDE 
GUIDANCE FOR OUR REPLY TO GRANIC. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  WHEN WE WERE FIRST INFORMED BY FOREIGN 
MINISTER GRANIC THAT BOBAN WOULD BE TAKING A \"LONG 
VACATION,\" THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT THIS WAS PART OF 
AN EFFORT TO GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY AND, COMBINED 
WITH THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL FOR 
\"HERCEG-BOSNA,\" PERHAPS PART OF AN EFFORT TO EASE HIM 
OUT OF THE PICTURE ENTIRELY.  WE ALSO NOTE THAT 
FOREIGN MINISTER GRANIC WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY 
BOSNIAN CROAT LEADERS AKMADZIC AND TOMIC (WHOSE STARS 
APPEAR TO BE RISING) AT THE TALKS IN VIENNA WITH B-H 
PRIME MINISTER SALAJDZIC. 
 
6.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT BOBAN 
MIGHT AT SOME POINT BE TRIED FOR WAR CRIMES ALTHOUGH 
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER AT THE PRESENT TIME 
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE EXISTS TO MAKE THE CASE AGAINST 
HIM.  WE BELIEVE THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND HERE 
COULD BE IMPROVED IF ANOTHER \"VACATION SITE\" WERE 
FOUND FOR MR. BOBAN.  AUSTRALIA WAS AN IDEAL 
DESTINATION, BEING AT LEAST 48 AIR HOURS AWAY AND 
WITH A SUBSTANTIAL TIME DIFFERENCE BUT WE NOTE THAT 
THERE ARE REMOTE PARTS OF THE U.S. AS WELL.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  IN A JAN 5 ZAGREB BRIEFING CHAIRED BY UNSYG SPECIAL 
REPRESENTATIVE AKASHI, UNPROFOR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL 
COT BRIEFED AMBASSADORS ALBRIGHT AND GALBRAITH, ASSTSEC 
SHATTUCK, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ALBRIGHT DELEGATION ON

THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA.  COT 
EMPHASIZED THAT WHILE PEACKEEPING IS THE MANDATE IN 
CROATIA, PROTECTION OF HUMANITARIAN AID OPERATIONS IS THE 
TASK IN B-H.  WHILE THERE IS AT LEAST A TEMPORARY 
CEASEFIRE WORKING IN CROATIA, GENERAL WARFARE AND 
TARGETING OF HUMANITARIAN AID CONVOYS IN B-H CONTINUE 
UNABATED.  AMB. ALBRIGHT STRESSED THE NEED TO KEEP BOTH 
DISCUSSION OF UNPROFOR AND CRITICISM OF UN RESOLUTIONS 
AFFECTING ITS OPERATIONS WITHIN \"THE BOSOM OF THE 
FAMILY,\" AND OUT OF PUBLIC FORA. 
 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  AFTER A BRIEF INTRODUCTION FROM AKASHI AND A SHORT 
PRESENTATION ON UNPROFOR CIVIL AND HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS 
PROJECTS, GENERAL COT OPENED THE FLOOR TO QUESTIONS. 
AMB. ALBRIGHT ASKED FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT 
COMBAT LEVELS IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA AND THEIR EFFECT ON 
PEACE PROSPECTS AND HUMANITARIAN AID OPERATIONS. 
 
------- 
CROATIA 
------- 
 
3.  COT SAID THAT PEACEKEEPING IS THE UNPROFOR MANDATE IN 
CROATIA.  SINCE DECEMBER 23 THERE HAD BEEN A GENERALLY- 
RESPECTED, UNPROFOR-BROKERED PROVISIONAL CEASEFIRE 
BETWEEN CROATIAN AND KRAJINA SERB FORCES.  UNPROFOR IS 
WORKING TO PERSUADE THE SIDES TO EXTEND THE CEASEFIRE 
BEYOND ITS CURRENT JAN 15 TERMINATION DATE.  THIS PERIOD 
OF RELATIVE STABILITY MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH UNPROFOR

CNN,\" COT ADDED.

BOSNIA 
------ 
 
4.  COT SAID UNPROFOR\'S MANDATE TO PROTECT HUMANITARIAN 
AID OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA WAS SEVERELY HAMPERED BY THE 
HIGHLY DANGEROUS SITUATION ON THE GROUND, ESPECIALLY IN 
CENTRAL BOSNIA.  BOTH THE GENERAL LEVEL OF COMBAT AND 
TARGETING OF HUMANITARIAN CONVOYS WERE INCREASING.  COT 
PARTICULARLY NOTED THE RECENT HEAVY FIGHTING IN THE VITEZ 
AREA.  AT PRESENT, SERB FORCES THERE HAD BECOME 
\"INTERESTED SPECTATORS\" TO THE RAGING CONFLICT BETWEEN 
BOSNIAN CROAT (HVO) AND MAINLY MUSLIM GOVERNMENT FORCES, 
BUT COT PREDICTED NEW SERB OFFENSIVES SOON.

          JAN 5 BRIEFING FOR AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT 
 
5.  A/S SHATTUCK ASKED COT TO CHARACTERIZE UNPROFOR 
TACTICS FOR PROTECTING AID OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA, 
PARTICULARLY UNPROFOR\'S VIEW ON WHETHER A MORE \"RIGOROUS\" 
POSTURE IN DEFENDING RELIEF FLOWS WOULD BE WISE.  COT 
RESPONDED THAT UNPROFOR AND UNHCR OPERATIONS ARE \"WHOLLY 
INTERTWINED,\" DESPITE UNHCR\'S \"TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHY OF 
AVOIDING PEOPLE IN KHAKI.\"  COT RESISTED ANY IMPLICATION 
THAT UNPROFOR WAS LESS THAN RIGOROUS IN ITS RELIEF

PROTECTION EFFORTS.  HE NOTED THAT A FRENCH UNPROFOR 
SOLDIER IN SARAJEVO HAD RECENTLY BEEN WOUNDED, AND 
POSSIBLY PARALYZED, WHEN HE DROVE A UNHCR RELIEF DELIVERY 
INTO A SECTOR CONSIDERED TOO DANGEROUS FOR UNHCR DRIVERS. 
UNPROFOR REGULARLY MAKES DIRECT DELIVERI 
ES INTO SUCH 
AREAS OF SARAJEVO, AS WELL AS MANY OF THE MOST DANGEROUS 
ZONES IN CENTRAL BOSNIA. 
 
-------- 
SARAJEVO 
-------- 
 
6.  AMB. ALBRIGHT ASKED COT FOR HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE 
SITUATION IN SARAJEVO.  COT RESPONDED THAT UNHCR COULD 
OFFER A MORE GENERAL BRIEFING, BUT HE COULD ADDRESS THE 
MILITARY ENVIRONMENT.  COT OBSERVED THAT THE FIGHTING IN 
SARAJEVO IS TERRIBLE, BUT DISTRIBUTION THERE OF 
HUMANITARIAN AID WAS, IN MANY WAYS, THE BEST IN BOSNIA. 
HE FURTHER STRESSED THAT SOME HIGHLY VISIBLE ASPECTS OF 
THE SIEGE, NAMELY THE CONSTANT SERB ARTILLERY AND SNIPER 
FIRE, MAY OBSCURE THE REAL MILITARY EQUATION. 
APOLOGIZING FOR ENGAGING IN \"A MACABRE ARITHMETIC,\" COT 
STRESSED THAT THE NUMBER OF KILLED AND WOUNDED IN 
SARAJEVO WAS GENERALLY LOWER THAN WHAT MIGHT BE ASSUMED 
ON THE BASIS OF THE DAILY COUNT OF ARTILLERY IMPACTS. 
MOREOVER, ESPECIALLY HEAVY SERB ARTILLERY BARRAGES IN 
RECENT DAYS WERE IN PART RESPONSES TO INCREASINGLY STRONG 
INFANTRY CHALLENGES BY BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES IN THE 
MOUNT ZUK AREA OF THE CITY AND ELSEWHERE.

DELEGATION\'S CONCERN THAT UNPROFOR TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN 
KEEPING THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES COMMISSION AND OTHER 
BODIES INFORMED ABOUT ATROCITIES IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA. 
COT NOTED THAT THE RECENT MASSACRES IN THE MEDAK POCKET 
(IN CROATIA) AT STUPNI DOL (IN CENTRAL B-H) HAD BEEN 
THOROUGHLY DOCUMENTED BY UNPROFOR MILITARY AND CIVILAN 
POLICE ELEMENTS AND REPORTED TO THE COMMISSION AND OTHER 
APPROPRIATE ENTITIES.  HE THEN OPINED, IN PASSIONATE 
TERMS, THAT \"ALTHOUGH WE IN UNPROFOR ARE NOT ALWAYS SURE 
WHY WE ARE STILL HERE, WE DO KNOW THAT, WERE WE NOT HERE 
AS WITNESSES, THERE WOULD BE MANY MORE ATROCITIES.\" 
REFERRING LATER TO THIS POINT, AMB. ALBRIGHT ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT UNPROFOR\'S PRESENCE MUST INDEED HAVE PREVENTED

UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, NOTING THAT 
MORE RESOLUTIONS HAD PASSED THERE IN THAT TIME THAN IN 
THE INSTITUTION\'S ENTIRE PREVIOUS HISTORY.  ONE REASON 
WAS SIMPLY THAT IT WAS EASIER IN A POST-COLD WAR 
ENVIRONMENT TO PASS RESOLUTIONS.  BEYOND THIS FACT, 
HOWEVER, THERE WERE EXTREMELY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR UN 
PEACEKEEPING IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD WAR.  SHE WENT ON TO 
OBSERVE THAT GENERAL COT HAD SOMETIMES CRITICIZED THE 
COUNCIL\'S RESOLUTIONS IN THEIR APPLICATION TO THE FORMER 
YUGOSLAVIA, AND ASKED IF HE COULD ELABORATE ON HIS 
PUBLICLY-STATED VIEWS. 
 
9.  COT SAID THAT, AS A SOLDIER, HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO 
EXPRESSING HIMSELF IN DIRECT AND SIMPLE FASHION.  PLANS 
CONCEIVED UNDER SOME UN RESOLUTIONS SEEMED TO HIM 
\"INCONCRETE.\"  HE CALLED THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION AND 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VANCE PLAN FOR CROATIA \"A SWINDLE,\" 
IN THE SENSE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD NEVER 
MADE AVAILABLE THE FORCES AND AUTHORITIY TO ACCOMPLISH 
THE MISSION.  WALKING TO A THEATER MAP ON THE CONFERENCE 
ROOM WALL, COT POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD HAD TO \"SCRAPE UP 
EVERY SOLDIER HE COULD LOCATE IN CROATIA AND B-H COMMAND\" 
TO STEM AN AUTUMN OUTBREAK OF FIGHTING BETWEEN CROATS AND 
KRAJINA SERBS IN CROATIA.  SUCH A SCRAMBLE POINTED UP THE 
WEAKNESSES OF UNPROFOR ASSETS, AND WAS A HUMILIATING 
EXERCISE FOR A GENERAL IN COMMAND OF INTERNATIONALLY- 
SUPPORTED PEACEKEEPING FORCES.  OPERATIONAL LIMITATIONS 
ON UNPROFOR IN BOSNIA MADE THE UN\'S PROTECTION EFFORT 
THERE ANOTHER \"SWINDLE,\" COT SAID.  OF THE 7,500 
ADDITIONAL TROOPS CALLED FOR TO IMPLEMENT \"SAFE AREAS,\" 
ONLY 2,000 HAD BEEN FORTHCOMING.

10.  AMB. ALBRIGHT RESPONDED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THESE 
FRUSTRATIONS, AND THAT THE UN NOW FINDS ITSELF WORKING IN 
\"A NEURALGIC TIME\" IN TRYING TO MAINTAIN PEACEKEEPING 
OPERATIONS AS PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT THE POLITICAL, FISCAL, 
AND HUMAN COSTS OF SUCH OPERATIONS INCREASES IN MANY 
NATIONS, INCLUDING THE UN 
ITED STATES.  EMPHASIZING THE 
NECESSITY OF LEARNING FROM MISTAKES, AMB. ALBRIGHT SAID 
SHE WAS NONETHELESS TROUBLED WHEN CRITICISMS OF THE UN BY 
OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE INSTITUTION APPEARED IN PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL MAY NEED TO LOOK EVEN 
MORE REALISTICALLY AT FUTURE RESOLUTIONS, BUT COMMANDERS 
IN THE FIELD SHOULD ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS FIRST \"IN THE 
BOSOM OF THE FAMILY\" AT THE UN, AND NOT IN PUBLIC FORA. 
GENERAL COT DID NOT RESPOND.  IN CONCLUSION, BOTH 
AMBASSADORS GALBRAITH AND ALBRIGHT EMPHASIZED THEIR 
APPRECIATION FOR THE COMMITMENT AND COURAGE OF UNPROFOR

27 BODIES FOUND IN KRIZANCEVO MASS GRAVE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
1.  ON JANUARY 6 UNPROFOR TROOPS WERE PERMITTED TO 
EXHUME A MASS GRAVE NEAR KRIZANCEVO (NEAR VITEZ, CENTRAL 
B-H).   BRITISH UNPROFOR ELEMENTS INVESTIGATING THE 
SITUATION THERE ON DECEMBER 29 WERE  FORCED TO WITHDRAW 
AFTER ENCOUNTERING HEAVY FIRE FROM B-H ARMY POSITIONS. 
 
2.  ON JANUARY 8, AFTER UNPROFOR DID GET ACCESS TO THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

SCENE, UNPROFOR REPRESENTATIVE SIMON GHILL GAVE THE 
CROATIAN DEFENSE COUNCIL (HVO) A LIST OF NAMES PROVIDED 
BY THE B-H ARMY FOR THE 27 BODIES FOUND IN THE GRAVE. 
ALL 27 WERE LISTED BY THE B-H ARMY AS HVO FIGHTERS OF 
THE VITEZ BRIGADE.  THE HVO ASSERTS, HOWEVER, THAT MOST 
OF THE BODIES EXHUMED WERE DRESSED AS CIVILIANS.  SO 
FAR, 15 OF THE BODIES HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED. 
 
3.  ACCORDING TO UNPROFOR, ANOTHER COMMON GRAVE NEAR THE 
KRIZANCEVO SITE CONTAINS AT LEAST 8 BODIES, ABOUT WHICH 
THE B-H ARMY SO FAR HAS PROVIDED NO INFORMATION.  IN 
ADDITION, HVO SOURCES SAY, THE B-H ARMY HAS REFUSED TO 
PERMIT RETRIEVAL OF SOME 15-20 BODIES LYING FOR THE LAST 
18 DAYS NEAR THE CONFRONTATION LINE.  THE B-H ARMY 
CLAIMS 74 CROATS IN ALL WERE KILLED DURING THE 
PRE-CHRISTMAS B-H ARMY OFFENSIVE NEAR KRIZANCEVO. 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
CROATIAN CITIZENS REPORTEDLY MOBILIZED TO FIGHT IN B-H 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4.  THE CROATIAN HELSINKI COMMITTEE (HHO) ISSUED A 
STATEMENT DECEMBER 29 CLAIMING THAT IN THE WEEKS 
PRECEDING THAT DATE SEVERAL THOUSAND CROATIAN CITIZENS 
BORN IN B-H HAD BEEN DRAFTED AND SENT TO THE B-H FRONT. 
THE HHO STATEMENT SAID MANY OF THE DRAFTEES ARE 
STUDENTS, RETIRED OR EVEN HANDICAPPED PERSONS.  THE HHO 
SAYS THEY WERE STATIONED IN CROATIAN MILITARY BARRACKS 
AND GIVEN UNIFORMS BEARING NO INSIGNIA.  THE COMMITTEE 
ALSO CLAIMS TO BE IN POSSESSION OF DOCUMENTS SHOWING 
THAT SOLDIERS SERVING IN THE CROATIAN ARMY, AFTER 
REFUSING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO B-H, WERE SUBJECTED TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

DISCIPLINARY MEASURES AND THREATENED WITH COURT MARTIAL. 
 
5.  MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SPOKESMAN GENERAL DRAGO KRPINA 
RESPONDED TO THE HHO CHARGES ON DECEMBER 31, SAYING 
\"NONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE HHO STATEMENT ARE 
CORRECT.\"  HE EXPLAINED THAT UNDER CROATIAN ARMY\'S 
MASTER DEVELOPMENT PLAN A SKELETON RESERVE BRIGADE WAS 
ESTABLISHED AND MANNED AT ONLY ONE QUARTER OF NORMAL 
BRIGADE STRENGTH, A FACT HE SAID REFUTES THE CHARGE THAT 
\"SEVERAL THOUSAND\" CROATIAN CITIZENS WERE MOBILIZED. 
WHERE THIS BRIGADE MIGHT BE DEPLOYED, ONCE ACTIVATED, 
\"WILL BE DECIDED THROUGH STANDARD PROCEDURES,\" THE 
SPOKESMAN SAID,  ADDING THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER 
NATIVE BOSNIAN CROATS WOULD VOLUNTEER TO SERVE IN BOSNIA 
\"TO DEFEND THE HEARTHS OF THEIR FOREFATHERS.\" 
 
6.  THE SPOKESMAN DID NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT 
SOME STUDENTS, WHO BY LAW HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE 
THEIR STUDIES, MIGHT HAVE BEEN INADVERTENTLY INCLUDED 
AMONG THE DRAFTEES.  IF SO, HE SAID, THEIR CASES WILL BE 
RECONSIDERED.  WHILE KRPINA DENIED THAT ANYONE HAD

7.  A POWERFUL EXPLOSION EARLY DECEMBER 24 MORNING 
SHATTERED THE CHRISTMAS CEASEFIRE CALM IN KARLOVAC, 
COMPLETELY DESTROYING ONE WING OF THE ORTHODOX EPARCHY 
RESIDENCE, PROPERTY OF THE SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, IN 
THE CENTER OF THE CITY.  SOME TEN SHOPS IN THE VICINITY 
ALSO WERE DAMAGED, AS WELL AS THE ROOF OF A NEARBY 
FRANCISCAN MONASTERY.  POLICE SAY A TIME BOMB APPARENTLY 
WAS THE CAUSE.  THE RESIDENCE HAD BEEN VACATED AND 
LOCKED SINCE SEPTEMBER 1991, WHEN MOST ORTHODOX CLERGY 
LEFT CROATIA.  A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN ORDERED 
BY CROATIAN AUTHORITIES. 
 
8. CROATIAN ROMAN CATHOLIC CARDINAL FRANJO KUHARIC 
IMMEDIATELY ISSUED A STRONG CONDEMNATION.  \"A CRIME HAS 
BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST THE LAW AND AGAINST PEACE,\" HE 
SAID.  \"RESOLUTELY AND WITH BITTERNESS WE PROTEST 
AGAINST THIS CRIME, WHICH HAS TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES NOT 
ONLY FOR THE EPARCHY BUT ALSO FOR CROATIA.  DURING 
CHRISTMAS, A CEASEFIRE WAS AGREED UPON IN THIS SENSITIVE 
TERRITORY.  THE BOMBING HAS VIOLATED THIS CEASEFIRE.  WE 
REQUEST A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  WE CONDEMN EACH ACT 
OF HATRED, VIOLENCE, AND REVENGE, BECAUSE IT IS AN 
ATTACK ON DIVINE AND HUMAN LAWS.  WHOEVER HAS COMMITTED 
THIS ACT IS AN ENEMY OF MAN AND THE NATION.\" 
 
9.   KARLOVAC DISTRICT GOVERNOR JOSIP JAKOVCIC ALSO 
CONDEMNED THE BOMBING AS A POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED 
CRIMINAL ACT.  JAKOVCIC SAID THAT THE PERPETRATORS \"DID 
CROATIA NO FAVOR -- JUST THE OPPOSITE.\"  HE CALLED THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

BOMBING A PREMEDITATED ACT, DESIGNED TO DESTABILIZE THE 
KARLOVAC REGION. 
10.  ACCORDING TO KARLOVAC MILITARY CORPS COMMANDER 
GENERAL PAVAO MILJEVAC, THE BOMBING DID GREAT HARM TO 
THE FRAGILE CEASEFIRE IN SECTOR NORTH.  \"WE MAINTAIN 
CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE OTHER SIDE,\" SAID MILJEVAC. 
\"SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO RESPECTING THE 
CEASEFIRE.  THE EPARCHY RESIDENCE IS NEAR THE 
CONFRONTATION LINE, WHERE FORCES ARE VERY CLOSE.  AN 
ESCALATION OF THE CONFLICT IS NOW POSSIBLE.  IT IS UP TO 
US TO PRESERVE PEACE.  WE WISH TO INFORM THE OTHER SIDE 
ABOUT THE DETAILS.  THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP, AS WELL AS 
THE GOVERNMENT, CONSIDERS THIS BOMBING A TERRORIST ACT, 
REGARDLESS OF WHO THE PERPETRATOR WAS.\"  (EMBASSY 
COMMENT: THE CHRISTMAS CEASEFIRE ESSENTIALLY HELD IN 
SECTOR NORTH AND THE INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING. END 
COMMENT)

GORAN HADZIC, THE LAME DUCK \"PRESIDENT\" OF THE 
\"REPUBLIC OF THE SERBIAN KRAJINA\" (RSK) AND MILAN 
ILIC, THE HEAD OF THE LOCAL \"REGIONAL COUNCIL.\" 
REGIONAL COUNCILS ARE SAID TO BE THE LOCAL 
LEGISLATIVE BODIES IN THE SERB-OCCUPIED TERRITORIES 
OF CROATIA.  THE MEETING TOOK PLACE IN A MUNICIPAL 
BUILDING AT THE BOROVO FACTORY OUTSIDE VUKOVAR. 
AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHATTUCK 
AND THEIR PARTY ALSO ATTENDED THE MEETING, BUT DID 
NOT PARTICIPATE.  EMBASSY CON/POL OFFICER WAS 
NOTETAKER.  THE MEETING WAS AGREED TO AFTER THE LOCAL 
SERBS THREATENED TO OBSTRUCT THE VISIT OF THE 
ALBRIGHT PARTY TO THE OVCARA GRAVE SITE UNLESS THEY 
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE GROUP.  THE BRIEF 
MEETING FOLLOWED THE VISIT TO THE GRAVE SITE. 
(NOTE:  OVCARA IS SAID TO BE THE SITE OF A MASS GRAVE 
WHERE THE BODIES OF UP TO THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE TAKEN 
BY THE SERBS FROM THE VUKOVAR HOSPITAL ARE BURIED. 
END NOTE.) 
 
2.  AFTER WELCOMING THE GROUP, HADZIC COMPLAINED THAT 
THE \"RSK\" WAS A \"SMALL AND POOR\" COUNTRY WHICH CANNOT 
GET THE TRUTH TO THE WORLD.  THE SERBS ARE BLAMED FOR 
EVERYTHING, HE SAID, EVEN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD 
BRIDGE IN MOSTAR.  IT IS NOT TRUE, HE ADDED, THAT 
EVERYTHING THE SERBS DO IS BAD AND EVERYTHING THE 
CROATS DO IS GOOD, \"JUST AS IT WOULD BE A LIE IF I 
TOLD YOU EVERYTHING THE SERBS DID WAS GOOD.\" HADZIC 
SAID THE SERBS HAD FOUGHT TO DEFEND THEIR HOMES AFTER 
THE WAR WAS STARTED BY CROATS WHO KILLED OR SET FIRE 
TO EVERYTHING WHICH BELONGED TO THE SERBS.  HE

3.  AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH RESPONDED THAT, AS 
\"AMBASSADOR TO THIS COUNTRY,\" HE WANTED TO EXPRESS 
THE UNITED STATES\' COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS FOR 
\"ALL OF THE PEOPLES OF FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.\"  NOTING 
THAT THE OVCARA SITE HAD MADE A STRONG IMPRESSION ON 
ALL MEMBERS OF THE GROUP, HE EXPRESSED THE 
DETERMINATION OF THE U.S. THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
WAR CRIMES \"ON ALL SIDES\" WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. 
HE THEN DETAILED U.S. POLICY TOWARDS THE REGION, 
SPECIFICALLY NOTING OUR SUPPORT FOR THE TERRITORIAL 
INTEGRITY OF CROATIA AND THE DEMAND THAT THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS OF ALL GROUPS, INCLUDING THE SERBIAN 
COMMUNITY, BE PROTECTED \"IN FACT AS WELL AS IN LAW.\" 
 
4.  HADZIC REPLIED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S \"SINCERE WISH FOR PEACE,\" BUT THAT IT 
WAS CLEAR \"YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF CERTAIN FACTS

SUBJECT:  TFSROL:  AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH MEETS WITH 
          \"KRAJINA PRESIDENT\" GORAN HADZIC 
 
REGARDING THE HISTORY\" OF THE REGION.  HE THEN 
CATALOGED THE SERBS\' HISTORICAL GRIEVANCES AND LAID 
BLAME FOR THE WAR ON THE CROATS.  REGARDING WAR 
CRIMES, HADZIC COMPLAINED THAT WAR CRIMES IN VIETNAM, 
CAMBODIA, AND ARGENTINA HAD NEVER BEEN PUNISHED AND 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00157  02 OF 02  121835Z 
ASKED WHY ATTENTION WAS FOCUSED ON CRIMES IN THE 
FORMER YUGOSLAVIA?  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT HE WAS 
WILLING TO SEE SERB CRIMINALS FACE THE TRIBUNAL AND 
EVEN UNDERSTOOD THAT SERBS MAY NEED TO BE THE FIRST 
TRIED, \"BUT NOT ONLY SERBS SHOULD BE TRIED.\" 
 
5.  MILAN ILIC, HEAD OF THE REGIONAL COUNCIL THEN 
DELIVERED A SPEECH FULL OF BOMBAST, COMPLETE WITH 
QUOTATIONS FROM MARX (AND ELIHU ROOT), WHILE 
WAVING IN THE AIR BOOKS ALLEGEDLY PROVING CROATIAN 
GUILT FOR THE WAR.  HE STATED FIRMLY THAT SERBS WOULD 
NEVER ACCEPT BEING PART OF CROATIA AGAIN BECAUSE 
\"THAT WOULD MEAN THE END OF SERBS\' EXISTENCE.\" 
 
6.  ASKED ABOUT THE RETURN OF DISPLACED PERSONS TO 
THEIR HOMES IN THE KRAJINA, HADZIC SAID THAT THOSE 
NOT GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES (ADDING \"WHILE MOST CROATS 
ARE, A FEW ARE NOT\") CAN RETURN AS SOON AS THEY 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE KRAJINA\'S SOVEREIGNTY AND BECOME 
\"RSK\" CITIZENS.  HADZIC QUIPPED THAT U.S. AND RSK 
POLICIES WERE NEARLY IDENTICAL, SINCE THE KRAJINA 
ALSO SUPPORTS CROATIA\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY \"WITHIN 
ITS CURRENT BOUNDARIES.\" 
 
7.  CONCLUDING THE MEETING, AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH SAID 
THAT HE FELT IT COULD MARK THE BEGINNING OF A 
DIALOGUE WITH THE SERBIAN COMMUNITY IN THE KRAJINA. 
 
8.  NOTE:  ON JANUARY 11, THE EMBASSY ASKED UNPROFOR 
TO ARRANGE A VISIT TO SECTOR EAST FOR A CONGRESSIONAL 
STAFF DELEGATION.  WHEN UNPROFOR WENT TO THE \"KRAJINA 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

REGIONAL COUNCIL\" TO \"INFORM THEM OF THE VISIT\" -- 
I.E., ASK THEIR PERMISSION -- THE SERB\'S ANSWERED 
WITH A FLAT NO.  UNPROFOR ARGUED THAT THIS WAS DUE TO 
ANXIETY AMONG LOCAL LEADERS IN THE BUILD-UP TO THE 
FINAL ROUND OF KRAJINA ELECTIONS.  BUT THEY ALSO 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE SERBS WERE NOT PLEASED THAT 
THEIR MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH HAD FAILED TO 
CONFER ON THEM ANY INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY OR ANY 
PERCEPTIBLE IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR IMAGE.  END NOTE.

MORE THAN AN HOUR, THE MEETING PARTICIPANTS ADDRESSED 
THE ISSUES OF MISSING PERSONS, WAR CRIMES AND THE 
HORRIFIC USE OF GENOCIDE AND ETHNIC CLEANSING AS 
EFFECTIVE TOOLS OF CONQUEST AT THE END OF THE 20TH 
CENTURY.  A/S SHATTUCK UNDERSCORED THE U.S. COMMITMENT 
TO A WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL TO BRING RESPONSIBLE 
INDIVIDUALS TO JUSTICE AND TO PRESSURE ALL SIDES IN THE 
CONFLICT TO RESPECT BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS.  END SUMMARY.

2.  CROATIAN PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED MS. LJUBICA BUTULA, 
PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY OF FAMILIES OF MISSING AND 
IMPRISONED DEFENDERS OF CROATIA;  DR. ZVONIMIR 
SEPAROVIC, PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR VICTIMOLOGY 
AND GENOCIDE;  PROFESSOR DRAGO ROKSANDIC, A UNIVERSITY

3.  A/S SHATTUCK SAID HE HAD COME TO CROATIA WITH UN 
AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE \"HUMAN 
RIGHTS CATASTROPHE\" UNFOLDING IN THE REGION, AND TO 
UNDERSCORE AMERICAN COMMITMENT TO ESTABLISHMENT OF A 
VIGOROUS INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIME TRIBUNAL.  A/S 
SHATTUCK INDICATED THE USG IS OFFERING USD 28 MILLION 
TO FUND THE TRIBUNAL BECAUSE THE U.S. BELIEVES THAT ALL 
ATROCITIES COME DOWN ULTIMATELY TO INDIVIDUAL 
RESPONSIBILITY, AND INDIVIDUALS MUST BE HELD TO 
ACCOUNT.  THE DISCUSSION WAS THEN TURNED OVER TO THE 
CROATIAN GUESTS FOR THEIR COMMENTS ON A RANGE OF 
ISSUES, INCLUDING MISSING PERSONS, WAR CRIMES, THE 
MEDIA AS A WEAPON AND THE USES OF GENOCIDE AND ETHNIC 
CLEANSING AS TOOLS OF CONQUEST.

THEY ESTIMATE UP TO 11,000 MAY BE MISSING.  (N.B. DR.

LISTS 7,000 MISSING, BUT HIS INSTITUTE BELIEVES THE 
NUMBER MAY BE AS HIGH AS 15,000.)  SHE SPOKE OF VUKOVAR

-- THE LOVELY DANUBE CITY THAT WAS LEVELLED BY SERBIAN 
AND YUGOSLAV ARMY FORCES EARLY IN THE 1991 WAR.  TWO 
HUNDRED AND SIXTY SICK AND INJURED PEOPLE WERE REMOVED 
BY SERBS FROM THE CITY HOSPITAL IN THE PRESENCE OF RED 
CROSS OBSERVERS, DRIVEN AW 
AY ON BUSES, AND NEVER SEEN 
AGAIN, BUTULA SAID. 
 
5.  BUTULA\'S OWN SON -- A FORMER EXCHANGE STUDENT IN 
OHIO -- WENT MISSING DURING THE WAR.  SHE WAS ONLY ABLE 
TO LOCATE AND REGAIN HIS REMAINS AFTER MANY MONTHS OF 
FRUSTRATING AND EXHAUSTIVE EFFORTS VIA THE RED CROSS 
AND OTHER ENTITIES.  BUTULA RECALLED THE AGONY OF 
UNCERTAINTY, AND INSISTED THAT SERB REFUSAL TO ACCOUNT 
FOR THE DEAD AMONG THE MISSING CONSTITUTED \"A KIND OF 
PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR AGAINST CROATIAN WOMEN.\"  BUTULA SAID 
HER ORGANIZATION DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY -- NOTABLY THE RED CROSS -- WAS DOING ENOUGH 
TO INSIST ON FULL ACCOUNTING OF MISSING PERSONS. 
 
6.  AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH OBSERVED THAT A KEY STEP IN 
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM IS TO CONTINUE TO PUBLICIZE IT 
WIDELY, AND TO THAT END, THE VISIT ON JANUARY 6 BY 
AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT AND A/S SHATTUCK TO VUKOVAR AND AN 
IDENTIFIED MASS GRAVE SITE NEARBY HAD REFOCUSED 
INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION ON WHAT HAPPENED THERE.

DISCUSSION OF WAR CRIMES AND ATROCITIES BY STATING THAT 
MOST SUCH ACTS IN THIS CONFLICT HAVE FLOWED FROM THE 
DELIBERATE STRATEGY OF ETHNIC CLEANSING, A MODERN 
ELABORATION ON THE ANCIENT TACTIC OF LAND CONQUEST 
THROUGH TERROR.  DR. LANG AGREED THAT THIS HAD BEEN THE 
SIMPLE AND RUTHLESSLY EFFECTIVE PLAN OF THE SERBS FROM 
THE OUTSET, THOUGH LATER IMITATED BY OTHER SIDES.  \"AT 
THE END OF THIS CENTURY IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT GENOCIDE 
IS REALLY THE MOST PROFITABLE FORM OF AGGRESSION,\" LANG 
ADDED. 
 
8.  MR. GOLDSTEIN FOCUSED ON MASS RAPE AS A 
PARTICULARLY NEW AND HORRIFIC ELEMENT OF THESE TACTICS 
AND OPINED THAT \"RAPE AS A MASS EVENT\" IS A DIRECTED 
AND SYSTEMATIC EFFORT, THOUGH THAT IS DIFFICULT TO 
PROVE.  TO MAKE THE POINT, HE OBSERVED THAT EVEN IN THE 
BARBAROUS STRUGGLE BETWEEN USTASHA, CHETNIK AND 
PARTISAN FORCES IN WORLD WAR II, MASS RAPE HAD NOT 
FIGURED PROMINENTLY AMONG THE MANY ATROCITIES 
COMMITTED.  (AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH NOTED THAT GOLDSTEIN

9.  PROFESSOR ROKSANDIC SPOKE AT LENGTH ON THE ROLE OF 
THE MEDIA AS A WEAPON OF WAR AND THE SIGNAL INSTIGATION 
TO THIS ETHNIC CONFLICT.  THE USE OF MASS MEDIA AT THE 
OUTSET AND THROUGHOUT THE WARS IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA- 
HERZEGOVINA TO FAN ETHNIC SUSPICIONS AND ANXIETIES INTO 
ACTS OF VIOLENCE IS, IN ITSELF, A WAR CRIME, ROKANDIC 
ARGUED.  A/S SHATTUCK TOOK THE POINT FURTHER, ASKING IF 
ROKANDIC WAS SUGGESTING A DELIBERATE EXPLOITATION OF 
MEDIA BY SERB LEADER MILOSEVIC IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT 
SUCH TACTICS SHOULD COME WITHIN THE AUTHORITY OF THE 
WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL.  ROKSANDIC SAID THAT IT SHOULD BE 
INVESTIGATED. 
 
10.  LANG AGREED AND EXPANDED ON THIS THEME. 
ASSESSMENTS THAT THE CONFLICT IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA WAS 
AN INEVITABILITY OWING TO CERTAIN TRAITS AMONG \"THE 
BALKAN PRIMITIVES\" ARE \"RACIST AND DECEPTIVE, \" LANG 
SAID.  THIS IDEA -- CIRCULATED WIDELY IN WESTERN MEDIA 
AND AMONG POLICY ANALYSTS -- CONTRIBUTED TO 
INTERNATIONAL INACTION IN THE CRISIS AND HENCE WAS 
POSSIBLY FUELED BY SERB PROPAGANDA EFFORTS. 
 
------------------- 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE? 
------------------- 
 
11.  THE GROUP AGREED THAT ONGOING EFFORTS TO INTERRUPT 
HUMANITARIAN AID CONVOYS IN THE REGION CONSTITUTED A 
WAR CRIME AGAINST CIVILIAN POPULATIONS AND THAT THIS 
WAS ONE AREA IN WHICH ACTION COULD STILL BE TAKEN TO

SAVE LIVES, NOT JUST EXACT RETRIBUTION AFTER THE FACT. 
 
12.  THEY ALSO AGREED THAT OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS CONTINUE UNABATED AND MUST BE STOPPED, BUT 
LANG OBSERVED THAT HUMAN RIGHTS DISCUSSIONS IN THE 
BALKANS NOW OFTEN BECOME BOGGED DOWN IN ARGUMENTS ABOUT 
\"WHO IS MORE VICTIMIZED,\" WHICH OBSCURE PRIORITIES AND 
STUNT EFFECTIVE ACTION. 
 
13.  A/S SHATTUCK AND AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH ASKED THE 
GROUP TO COMMENT ON U.S. INSISTE 
NCE THAT MINORITY 
RIGHTS ARE KEY TO ANY PEACE PROCESS, AND MUST BE 
OBSERVED BOTH IN LAW AND IN FACT.  ROKSANDIC AGREED BUT 
SAID \"THAT DISCUSSION HAS NOT YET TAKEN PLACE\" IN 
CROATIA BETWEEN CROATS AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE SERB 
MINORITY WHICH DESIRE PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.  \"REAL 
DEMOCRATIZATION\" IS THE PRECURSOR TO SUCH A DIALOGUE, 
AND ONLY TRULY DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS -- NOTABLY A 
FAIR JUDICIARY --  CAN PROVIDE THE ASSURANCES

TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND APPEALED FOR GREATER 
AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE REGION THROUGH NATO.  HE 
ARGUED THAT THE WEST MUST AGREE ON A PEACE PLAN AND 
GIVE IT FULL SUPPORT BEFORE APPLYING PRESSURE ON THE 
PARTIES IN THE CONFLICT TO REACH A SETTLEMENT.  HE 
ASKED THAT THE LINK BE MAINTAINED BETWEEN SANCTIONS 
ON SERBIA AND A SOLUTION IN THE UNPAS. 
 
3.  AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT SOUGHT CROATIA\'S SUPPORT FOR 
THE WORK OF THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL, STRESSING THAT A 
LASTING PEACE IN THE REGION DEPENDS ON REMOVING 
COLLECTIVE GUILT AND ESTABLISHING INDIVIDUAL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CRIMES COMMITTED.  SHE AGREED IT 
WAS TOO EARLY TO TALK OF LIFTING SANCTIONS AGAINST 
SERBIA AND THAT SANCTIONS SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE 
SITUATION IN THE UNPAS.  SHE SAID CROATIA\'S IMAGE AT 
THE UNITED NATIONS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON THE INFLUENCE 
IT BRINGS TO BEAR TO END UNACCEPTABLE HVO ACTIVITIES. 
SHE CALLED THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE A MEANS FOR 
INTEGRATING ALL OF EUROPE AND NOTED THAT MEMBERSHIP 
IN NATO ENTAILS HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES. 
 
4.  AMB. GALBRAITH UNDERLINED THAT THE U.S. IS 
COUNTING ON CROATIA\'S COOPERATION ON HUMANITARIAN AID 
AND WAR CRIMES ISSUES.  ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHATTUCK 
STATED THAT THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL WOULD LAY DOWN A 
MARKER THAT GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS CANNOT 
BE COMMITTED WITH IMPUNITY. 
 
5.  PRESIDENT TUDJMAN REPLIED THAT THE WAR CRIMES 
TRIBUNAL HAD HIS FULL SUPPORT BUT THAT HE WAS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00335  01 OF 06  251811Z 
CONCERNED THAT ALL SIDES BE REQUIRED TO SURRENDER 
SUSPECTS WANTED FOR PROSECUTION.  HE SAID THE GOC HAD 
APPLIED PRESSURE TO REMOVE BOSNIAN CROAT LEADER MATE 
BOBAN BECAUSE IT DID NOT FEEL HE WAS THE RIGHT MAN TO 
NEGOTIATE A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE BOSNIAN CRISIS. 
HE COMMENTED THAT CROATIA WANTED TO SEE BOSNIA\'S 
MUSLIMS LINKED TO THE WEST AND NOT BECOME AN 
INSTRUMENT OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM.  HE NOTED THAT 
THE BOSNIAN CROATS HAD SUPPORTED EVERY PEACE PROPOSAL 
PUT FORWARD TO DATE BUT NOW FOUND THEMSELVES FIGHTING 
FOR THEIR VERY SURVIVAL. 
 
END SUMMARY. 
 
6.  AMBASSADORS GALBRAITH AND ALBRIGHT MET WITH 
PRESIDENT TUDJMAN AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE ON 
JANUARY 6 FOLLOWED BY A DINNER.  ALSO PRESENT WERE 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHATTUCK ON THE AMERICAN SIDE AND 
FOREIGN MINISTER MATE GRANIC, CHEF DE CABINET JURE 
RADIC, UN AMBASSADOR MARIO NOBILO, AND AMBASSADOR FOR 
HUMANITARIAN AID SLOBODAN LANG ON THE CROATIAN SIDE.

THANKS FOR SUPPORTING CROATIA\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7.  TUDJMAN WELCOMED AMB. ALBRIGHT, STATING THAT HE 
WAS PLEASED THAT CROATIAN-AMERICAN RELATIONS WERE 
DEVELOPING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION IN MANY AREAS.  HE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00335  02 OF 06  251812Z 
ESPECIALLY THANKED THE U.S. FOR ITS SUPPORT OF 
CROATIA\'S TERR 
ITORIAL INTEGRITY.  HE ADDED THAT 
CROATIA WAS COMMITTED TO SEEKING A POLITICAL SOLUTION 
\"AT ANY PRICE\" TO THE PROBLEMS OF B-H AND THE 
KRAJINA.  IN THAT REGARD, CROATIA OFFERED ITS FIRM 
SUPPORT FOR THE KINKEL-JUPPE PLAN AND TUDJMAN HAD 
UNDERTAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT 
IZETBEGOVIC IN BONN (JAN 8). 
 
----------------------------------- 
APPEAL FOR GREATER U.S. INVOLVEMENT 
----------------------------------- 
 
8.  TUDJMAN MADE A PERSONAL APPEAL FOR GREATER U.S. 
INVOLVEMENT IN FINDING A SOLUTION, ARGUING THAT 
EUROPE HAD NOT SHOWN ENOUGH UNITY OF OUTLOOK ON WHAT 
NEEDED TO BE DONE.  SIMILARLY, UNPROFOR, WITH ITS 
MANY NATIONAL CONTINGENTS, LACKED SUFFICIENT UNITY OF 
COMMAND TO CARRY OUT ITS MISSION EFFECTIVELY.  TUDJMAN 
THOUGHT NATO COULD DO THE JOB BETTER, WITH FEWER 
TROOPS, AND WITH A GREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
WEST MUST COMMIT TO ONE PLAN BEFORE APPLYING PRESSURE 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
9.  TUDJMAN COMMENTED THAT YASUSHI AKASHI, THE SYG\'S 
NEWLY-ARRIVED SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, BROUGHT VALUABLE 
EXPERIENCE TO THE JOB AND WOULD HELP TO INSTILL 
CONFIDENCE.  HOWEVER, HE CONTINUED, TO ACHIEVE PEACE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00335  02 OF 06  251812Z 
IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THE U.S., E.U., AND U.N. AGREE 
ON A SINGLE SOLUTION AND THEN SUPPORT IT FIRMLY.  HE 
SPECIFICALLY CITED THE THREATS BY THE U.K. AND FRANCE 
TO WITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS.  HE ARGUED THAT THESE AND 
OTHER COUNTRIES \"SHOULD DECIDE WHAT IT IS THEY WANT\" 
BEFORE PRESSURING THE PARTIES TO REACH AGREEMENT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
KEEP LINK BETWEEN SANCTIONS AND SOLUTION TO UNPAS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
10.  TUDJMAN SAID CROATIA WAS TRYING TO RESOLVE THE 
SITUATION IN THE UNPAS BY PEACEFUL MEANS WHILE 
RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES. 
HE APPEALED TO AMB. ALBRIGHT FOR THE U.S. TO MAINTAIN 
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST SERBIA UNTIL A SOLUTION 
WAS FOUND FOR THE UNPAS.  THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE 
UNPAS AS \"PRACTICALLY UNDER OCCUPATION BY SERBIA,\" 
WHICH IS SENDING ARMS TOGETHER WITH GENERALS AND EVEN 
AN ADMIRAL TO ASSIST THE KRAJINA SERB MILITARY FORCES. 
TUDJMAN SAID THAT CROATIA WANTS TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS

MOVED BY HER VISIT EARLIER IN THE DAY TO VUKOVAR AND 
THE MASS GRAVE AT OVCARA.  SHE STATED THAT PERMANENT 
PEACE CAN COME TO THE REGION ONLY WHEN THE SENSE OF 
COLLECTIVE GUILT IS EXPUNGED.  FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, 
SHE ARGUED, THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR 
CRIMES AND ATROCITIES ON ALL SIDES MUST BE FOUND AND 
PROSECUTED.  THAT IS WHY THE U.S. IS PROVIDING STRONG 
SUPPORT FOR THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL.  AMB. ALBRIGHT 
SAID SHE HOPED CROATIA WOULD DO THE SAME. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
NOT YET TIME TO TALK OF LIFTING SANCTIONS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
12.  AMB. ALBRIGHT SAID THE U.S. VIEW IS THAT IT IS 
NOT YET TIME TO SPEAK OF LIFTING SANCTIONS ON SERBIA. 
LIFTING SANCTIONS MUST BE LINKED TO A SOLUTION IN THE 
UNPAS.  SHE NOTED THAT THE U.S. HAD PLAYED A KEY ROLE 
IN THE FORMULATION OF UNSCR 871 AND THAT CROATIA 
\"COULD COUNT ON US\" TO REMAIN FIRM ON THIS ISSUE.

CROATIA\'S IMAGE DEPENDS ON ACTIONS OF THE HVO

13.  TURNING TO THE ISSUE OF ACCESS FOR HUMANITARIAN 
AID, AMB. ALBRIGHT SAID THE U.S. IS COUNTING ON 
CROATIA\'S HELP TO SEE THAT THE CONVOYS GET THROUGH. 
HOW CROATIA IS REGARDED AT THE UN VERY MUCH DEPENDS 
ON THIS ISSUE, SHE STRESSED.  SHE NOTED THAT, AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE CONFLICT, AS THE VICTIM OF SERBIAN

AGGRESSION, CROATIA\'S STOCK WAS VERY HIGH.  AT 
PRESENT, HO 
WEVER, THE WEST IS INCREASINGLY CONCERNED 
OVER UNACCEPTABLE HVO ACTIONS. 
 
14.  AMB. ALBRIGHT SAID THE U.S. KNOWS THAT CROATIA 
EXERTS INFLUENCE ON THE HVO, AND FAILURE TO PREVENT 
HVO MISDEEDS AFFECTS OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD CROATIA. 
SHE SAID TUDJMAN SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, ULTIMATELY, 
SANCTIONS MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN CROATIA\'S CASE AS 
WELL.  SHE SAID SHE HOPED THAT EVENTS WOULD NOT COME 
TO SUCH AN IMPASSE AND THAT CROATIA WOULD USE ITS 
INFLUENCE TO REIN IN THE HVO.

CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE 
NATO ALLIANCE.  THE U.S. WANTS A SAFE, SECURE 
CONTINENT WITHOUT ARTIFICIAL DIVIDING LINES.  IN THAT 
REGARD, THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE IS A DYNAMIC AND

16.  AMB. ALBRIGHT POINTED OUT THAT MEMBERSHIP IN 
NATO CARRIES WITH IT GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES.  SHE 
NOTED THAT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WILL DEMONSTRATE THE 
ABILITY TO ACCEPT THESE RESPONSIBILITIES AT DIFFERENT 
TIMES.  KEY IN THIS REGARD WILL BE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF 
A FULLY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY WITH A MARKET ECONOMY IN 
WHICH CSCE PRINCIPLES AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY ARE 
RESPECTED. 
 
17.  AMB. ALBRIGHT SAID THE SITUATION IN THE FORMER 
YUGOSLAVIA MUST BE RESOLVED.  \"THIS KILLING IS A 
BLIGHT ON SOCIETY.\"  AMERICA IS NOT ABSENT IN THIS

A SOLUTION ON THE PARTIES.  A FINAL AGREEMENT MUST BE 
ACCEPTED WILLINGLY.

U.S. COUNTING ON CROATIA\'S COOPERATION 
-------------------------------------- 
 
18.  AMB. GALBRAITH SAID HE WISHED TO REINFORCE THE 
COMMENTS MADE BY AMB. ALBRIGHT.  HE NOTED THAT HE HAD 
SPOKEN TO THE PRESIDENT MANY TIMES ON THE ISSUE OF 
ACCESS FOR HUMANITARIAN AID TO CENTRAL BOSNIA.  IN 
THAT REGARD, WE HAD SEEN SOME PROGRESS, BUT WE WERE 
LOOKING FOR MORE.  HE COMMENDED CROATIA ON USING ITS 
INFLUENCE TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF DETAINEES IN B-H. 
 
19.  ON THE ISSUE OF WAR CRIMES, AMB. GALBRAITH SAID 
THAT CROATIA\'S COOPERATION WAS CRITICAL.  MANY CRIMES

HAD BEEN COMMITTED ON CROATIAN SOIL AND MANY PEOPLE 
PRESENTLY LOCATED IN CROATIA, INCLUDING REFUGEES FROM 
B-H, HAD BEEN WITNESSES TO CRIMES.  HE EXPRESSED 
APPRECIATION FOR CROATIA\'S WORK IN COLLECTING 
EVIDENCE AND COOPERATION ON THE INVESTIGATION OF MASS 
GRAVES.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT IT IS LIKELY 
THAT CROATS TOO WILL BE SOUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH WAR 
CRIMES.  IT WILL BE IMPORTANT THAT CROATIA SURRENDER 
SUCH PEOPLE FOR PROSECUTION.  NO ONE, WITH THE 
POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF B-H, HAS MORE 
REASON THAN THE GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA TO PURSUE THIS 
ISSUE WITH THE UTMOST VIGOR.

21.  IN RESPONSE, PRESIDENT TUDJMAN EXPRESSED HIS 
THANKS FOR THE DELEGATION\'S VISIT TO VUKOVAR, WHICH 
HAS GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR CROATIA.  HE NOTED, WITH 
REGRET, THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER AREAS OF 
CROATIA DEVASTATED IN A SIMILAR FASHION. 
 
22.  TUDJMAN ASSURED AMB. ALBRIGHT THAT CROATIA WILL 
SUPPORT ALL EFFORTS TO PURSUE THE ISSUE OF WAR CRIMES 
AND DO ALL POS 
SIBLE TO FIND THOSE WHO ARE PERSONALLY 
RESPONSIBLE.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD BE 
\"BAD\" IF CROATIA, WHICH WAS A VICTIM OF AGGRESSION, 
WERE TO DELIVER ITS OWN CITIZENS FOR PROSECUTION 
WHILE THOSE OF THE AGGRESSOR REMAINED UNTOUCHED. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
BOBAN NOT RIGHT MAN TO NEGOTIATE PEACE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
23.  TUDJMAN NOTED THAT CROATIA HAD BROUGHT ITS 
INFLUENCE TO BEAR TO EFFECT CHANGES IN THE BOSNIAN 
CROAT LEADERSHIP.  HE SAID MATE BOBAN WAS NO LONGER 
THE MAIN REPRESENTATIVE OF OR CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR 
THE BOSNIAN CROATS.  STILL, TUDJMAN ARGUED THAT BOBAN 
COULD NOT BE HELD PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE 
MISTAKES WHICH HAD BEEN MADE ON THE CROAT SIDE.  HE 
SAID BOBAN HAD COME OUT OF OBSCURITY TO LEAD THE 
DEFENSE OF HERZEGOVINA AGAINST SERBIAN AGGRESSION AND 
THAT IN DOING SO HE HAD ALSO DEFENDED CROATIA. 
LIKEWISE, BOBAN HAD LED THE DEFENSE WHEN MUSLIM

THAT BOBAN WAS NOT THE RIGHT PERSON TO TAKE THE LEAD 
IN THE PRESENT EFFORTS TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION 
TO THE CONFLICT.

CROATIA WANTS BOSNIA\'S MUSLIMS LINKED TO THE WEST

24.  TUDJMAN SAID THAT CROATIA WAS DOING EVERY THING 
POSSIBLE TO REMOVE OBSTACLES TO A POLITICAL 
SETTLEMENT.  HE STATED THAT CROATIA HAD A VERY STRONG 
INTEREST IN SEEING THAT B-H MUSLIMS WERE LINKED TO 
THE WEST AND DID NOT BECOME AN INSTRUMENT OF ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM.  HE NOTED THAT CROATIA HAD URGED 
BOSNIA\'S CROATS TO SUPPORT THE (EARLY 1992) 
REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE.  CROATIA WAS THE FIRST 
COUNTRY TO HAVE AN AMBASSADOR ACCREDITED IN SARAJEVO. 
CROATIA AND THE BOSNIAN CROATS HAD SUPPORTED EVERY

25.  THE PRESIDENT CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT HE VIEWED 
THE CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS AS ANALOGOUS TO THE 
SCANDINAVIAN WARS OF THE LAST CENTURY.  HE EXPRESSED 
HIS BELIEF THAT REPEATED ATTEMPTS BY ONE NATION TO 
ASSERT HEGEMONY OVER OTHERS IN THE REGION WILL ONLY 
BE SOLVED WHEN THERE IS MUTUAL RECOGNITION AND FULL 
RESPECT FOR THE ETHNIC RIGHTS OF ALL GROUPS.

26.  AMB. ALBRIGHT SAID THAT SHE SECONDED TUDJMAN\'S 
LAST THOUGHTS, NOTING THAT THE RECENT HISTORY OF THE 
BALKANS WAS LITTERED WITH MISTAKES AND MISSED 
OPPORTUNITIES.  SHE EXPLAINED THAT THE U.S. WISHED TO 
HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE RELATIONS WITH CROATIA AND 
LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN THAT WOULD BE 
POSSIBLE.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT CROATIA HAD HAD A 
GOOD BUT MIXED RECORD.  SHE RECOGNIZED THAT THE 
COUNTRY WAS OPERATING UNDER DIFFICULT CONDITIONS BUT 
EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT PRESIDENT TUDJMAN WOULD TAKE 
THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT CROATIA\'S GOOD NAME 
AND ESTABLISH AN EXCELLENT RECORD SO THAT THERE WOULD 
NEVER BE THE NEED EVEN TO THINK OF SANCTIONS.

         NAME-CALLING 
 
1. (U)  THIS EMBASSY CONTINUES TO NOTE THE ROLE OF THE 
LOCAL MEDIA IN HEIGHTENING ETHNIC TENSIONS.  GOVERNMENT 
OWNED AND CONTROLLED CROATIAN TV (HTV) ON SATURDAY, 
JAN. 29, BROADCAST TWO UNSCHEDULED DOCUMENTARIES 
BACK-TO-BACK IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EVENING NEWS.  THE 
FIRST WAS A TWENTY MINUTE FILM CALLED \"THE ROAD TO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00467  01 OF 02  021626Z 
CENTRAL BOSNIA\" AND THE SECOND WAS A LONGER FEATURE 
CALLED \"THE CHRONOLOGY OF MUSLIM WAR CRIMES AGAINST 
CROATS IN B-H.\"  THE EVENING MOVIE WAS DELAYED AN HOUR 
IN ORDER TO AIR THESE DOCUMENTARIES.  THE TV SPECIALS 
WERE NOT ON THE DAILY TV SCHEDULE BUT HAD BEEN WELL 
ADVERTISED DURING THE DAY ON HTV.  AS THE TITLES 
INDICATE, THEY FOCUSED ON MUSLIM MISDEEDS IN CENTRAL 
B-H.  BOTH DOCUMENTARIES APPEARED HASTILY PUT TOGETHER, 
AND WERE POORLY PRODUCED.  NEITHER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A 
NARRATED SCRIPT AND BOTH CONSISTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY 
OF AMATEUR FOOTAGE AND TAPED INTERVIEWS WITH LOCAL 
BOSNIAN CROATS DESCRIBING MUSLIM ATROCITIES.  THERE WAS 
LITTLE DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED AS TO THE TIME AND PLACE 
OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED. 
 
2. (U)  \"THE ROAD TO CENTRAL BOSNIA\" INCLUDED 
INTERVIEWS WITH CROAT RESIDENTS OF CENTRAL BOSNIA (ALL 
EXPRESSING FEAR OF MUSLIM FORCES) AND CROAT SOLDIERS. 
THE OVERALL MESSAGE WAS \"THE ENEMY IS COMING AND WE ARE 
PREPARED.\"  \"THE CHRONOLOGY OF WAR CRIMES\" WAS MORE 
POWERFUL WITH GRAPHIC PICTURES OF CORPSES AND WEEPING 
SURVIVORS, MOSTLY WOMEN.  IN ALL CASES, MUSLIMS WERE 
NAMED AS THE PERPETRATORS OF THE MASSACRES.  MOST OF 
THE FOOTAGE CLEARLY DATED FROM THE FALL OR BEFORE. 
- 
3. (C)  ONE EMBARRASSED PROFESSIONAL TV JOURNALIST 
COMPLAINED TO OUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER THAT THIS LINE 
OF TV PROGRAMMING WAS DIRECTED BY THE HEAD OF HTV, 
ANTON VRDOLJAK.  VRDOLJAK IS A HIGHLY UNPOPULAR, BUT 
INFLUENTIAL, MEMBER OF THE RULING PARTY AND THE 
CROATIAN PARLIAMENT.  ACCORDING TO THE JOURNALIST, THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00467  01 OF 02  021626Z 
PROGRAMMING CHIEF AT HTV WAS AFRAID OF VRDOLJAK AND 
WOULD NEVER RESIST WHAT THE \"BIG MAN\" DIRECTED. 
 
4. (U)  THESE TV BROADCASTS CONTRAST TO THOSE IN THE 
AUTUMN WHICH DEPICTED GRAPHICALLY (USING CNN FOOTAGE) 
STARVING MUSLIMS IN THE HVO-RUN DETENTION CAMPS AND THE 
HVO\'S DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD BRIDGE IN MOSTAR.  HTV HAS 
ALSO AIRED SHOWS WITH SURPRISINGLY CANDID CRITICISM 
FROM OPPOSITION LEADERS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S B-H 
POLICY.  THUS, THESE CRUDE PROPAGANDIST EFFORTS 
REPRESENT A BACKWARD STEP FOR HTV, AS WELL AS A SIGN OF 
A DEGENERATING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. 
 
5. (C)  ANXIETY AMONG MUSLIM RESIDENTS OF ZAGREB WAS 
EXPRESSED BY THE WIFE OF A LEADING MUSLIM HUMANITARIAN 
AID WORKER WHO IS ALSO A PROFESSIONAL.  SHE DECLINED AN 
INVITATION FOR A PRESTIGIOUS USIA VISITORS\' PROGRAM 
BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT HER EMPLOYER WOULD FIRE HER IF SHE 
WAS ABSENT FROM HER JOB.  OBVIOUSLY AGITATED AND 
FRUSTRATED SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD BEEN WARNED FOUR TIMES

          ATROCITIES AGAINST BOSNIAN CROATS IN 1993 
 
1.  THE SEMI-INDEPENDENT SPLIT-BASED WEEKLY \"NEDELJNA 
DALMACIJA\" ON JAN 5 PUBLISHED A LENGTHY PIECE BY 
RESPECTED FREELANCER MARIO MARUSIC ON THE THREAT 
FACED BY BOSNIAN CROATS FROM B-H ARMY OR ALLIED 
FORCES.  MARUSIC DECRIES THE PAUCITY OF ATTENTION TO 
ATROCITIES SUFFERED BY BOSNIAN CROATS WHILE THE 
WORLD\'S ATTENTION WAS RIVETED ON \"AHMICI, STUPNI DOL, 
AND THE OLD BRIDGE (IN MOSTAR).  AT THE END OF THE 
PIECE, MARUSIC INCLUDED A LIST OF \"THE MAJOR\"

(ALLEGED) ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY B-H ARMED FORCES 
AGAINST BOSNIAN CROATS IN 1993. 
 
2.  SOME OF THE INCIDENTS ARE WELL-KNOWN, SUCH AS 
UZDOL AND THE KILLING OF THE TWO FRANCISCAN FRIARS AT 
FOJNICA; OTHERS, SUCH AS THOSE CENTERED AROUND 
KONJIC, HAVE LONG BEEN BEEN ALLEGED BUT NEVER 
SUBSTANTIATED (OR, IN MOST CASES, EVEN INVESTIGATED, 
SO FAR AS WE KNOW); AND STILL OTHERS WE HAD NOT 
HERETOFORE HEARD ABOUT. 
 
3.  IN ATTEMPTING TO ASCERTAIN THE ORIGINAL SOURCES 
OF MARUSIC\'S REPORT, WE LEARNED THAT MOST OR ALL OF 
THE PRE-AUGUST 20 ALLEGED INCIDENTS WERE CHRONICLED 
IN A \"HERCEG-BOSNA\" PUBLICATION OF AROUND THAT DATE 
WHICH COVERED THE PERIOD FROM 1991 TO THE DATE OF 
PUBLICATION.  SOURCE MATERIAL FOR INCIDENTS ALLEGED 
TO HAVE OCCURRED AFTER AUGUST 20 ALSO COMES FROM 
\"HERCEG-BOSNA,\" FROM TESTIMONIES FILED WITH ODPR 
(OFFICE OF DISPLACE PERSONS AND REFUGEES) BY PERSONS 
ALLEGEDLY WITNESSING THE EVENT. 
 
4.  BECAUSE OF THE ORIGINAL \"HERCEG-BOSNA\" SOURCING, 
THE ATROCITIES LIST CANNOT BE CONSIDERED 
SUBSTANTIATED.  WE REPORT IT, HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF ITS 
SPECIFICITY, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST SOME OF 
THESE INCIDENTS DID TAKE PLACE, AND BECAUSE MARUSIC, 
WHO HAS A SOLID REPUTATION, CLAIMS TO HAVE PERSONALLY 
GONE OVER THE ORIGINAL SOURCE MATERIALS (TESTIMONIES, 
MAPS, ETC) FOR BOTH PRE AND POST AUGUST 20 ATROCITIES 
AND FOUND THEM COMPELLING.

8.  (U) THE NEXT DAY WAS MUCH THE SAME ROUTINE, BUT 
THAT NIGHT AND FOR THE REST OF THE TIME THE WITNESS 
WAS IN LUKA, SERBS CAME IN WITH FLASHLIGHTS AND TOOK 
20 TO 30 PRISONERS EACH NIGHT.  THE OTHER PRISONERS 
WOULD THEN HEAR SHOTS AND SCREAMS.  THE NEXT DAY, 
FOUR MEN WOULD BE TAKEN EITHER TO LOAD BODIES INTO 
REFRIGERATOR TRUCKS OR TO THROW THEM INTO THE SAVA 
RIVER. 
 
9.  (U) ONE PRISONER, MIRSAD MUJAGIC, WHO WAS A 
POLICEMAN BEFORE THE WAR, WAS BEATEN BY TWELVE 
BLACK-CLAD SERBS WITH BASEBALL BATS.  THEY 
SYSTEMATICALLY BROKE HIS FINGERS, ARMS, AND KNEES. 
THEN, RANKO CESIC, ONE OF THE MAIN SERBS FROM BRCKO, 
KILLED MUGAJIC WITH A PISTOL.  WITH CESIC WAS MIODRAG 
CAJEVIC, ALSO FROM BRCKO. 
 
10.  (U) TWO DAYS LATER, A SERBIAN CAPTAIN, DRAGAN 
KABLINOVIC, WHO WORKED IN THE SAME FACTORY AS THE 
WITNESS, CAME INTO THE WAREHOUSE LOOKING FOR SEVEN 
YOUNG MEN TO CLEAN UP GLASS AT THE MEDICAL CLINIC. 
THE WITNESS ASKED TO BE TAKEN AS WELL, AND HIS REQUEST 
WAS GRANTED.  AT THE CLINIC, THEY WERE GREETED BY 
ABOUT 70 SERBS STANDING IN TWO ROWS WAITING TO BEAT 
THE SEVEN MEN TO DEATH.  ONE OF THE SERBS, HOWEVER, A 
MAN NAMED MICIN, REFUSED TO ALLOW THEM TO HIT THE MEN 
MORE THAN ONCE.  AN EARLIER GROUP OF VICTIMS WAS NOT 
SO LUCKY, AS THEY WERE LYING ON THE GROUND COVERED IN 
BLOOD AND UNABLE TO STAND.  TWO DAYS LATER, THE 
WITNESS LEARNED THAT MICIN TOOK ADAM ZELEZIC AND HIS

WAS STAYING.  THEY TOLD MICIN THAT THE WITNESS WAS 
ALSO IN LUKA AND ASKED HIM TO GET HIM.  THE NEXT DAY, 
MAY 14, MICIN RETRIEVED THE WITNESS FROM LUKA AND 
TOOK HIM TO THE WITNESS\' HOUSE.  THEY STAYED IN THEIR 
LARGE APARTMNT TWO MONTHS UNDER HOUSE ARREST, UNTIL, 
ON JULY 14, ALL THE MUSLIM MEN FROM THAT AREA WERE 
TAKEN IN THREE BUSSES TO THE PRISON CAMP \"BATKOVIC\" 
NEAR BIJELJINA.

WITNESS SAID AT 
LEAST 13 PRISONERS DIED OF BEATINGS, BUT HE WAS 
UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY NAMES.  THE WITNESS WAS ABLE TO 
IDENTIFY ONE AS THE OWNER OF A JEWELRY STORE AND 
ANOTHER AS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.  THE WITNESS SAID 
THAT EKREM CUDIC FROM BRCKO WAS FORCED TO WORK EVEN 
THOUGH VERY ILL AND WAS BADLY BEATEN FOR NOT BEING 
ABLE TO WORK HARDER.  ONE DAY, EKREM CUDIC TOOK AWAY 
A GUARD\'S RIFLE AND SLAPPED HIM.  THE OTHER GUARDS 
SHOT AND KILLED HIM. 
 
12.  (U)  ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, THE MOST CRUEL 
GUARDS AT THE BATKOVIC CAMP WERE GLIGOR BEGOVIC AND 
DZEMAL (\"SPAJZER\") ZAHIROVIC , A GYPSY FROM ZENICA 
WHO WAS LIKE A TRUSTEE OR KAPO.  THE DIRECTOR OF THE 
CAMP WAS VELIBOR (\"VELJO\") STOJANOVIC;  HIS SUPERIOR 
WAS A JNA COLONEL NAMED PETAR DMITROVIC. 
 
13.  (U)  THE WITNESS SAID THAT CONDITIONS WERE VERY 
DIFFICULT FOR THE FIRST MONTH IN THE BATKOVIC CAMP, 
UNTIL A VISIT FROM ICRC WAS ANNOUNCED.  UNTIL THEN, 
PRISONERS HAD ONLY ONE BLANKET APIECE TO COVER THE 
BARE CONCRETE FLOOR.  AFTERWARDS, THEY WERE GIVEN 
STRAW FOR THE FLOOR.  BEFORE THE ICRC ARRIVED, A CORN 
CRIB WAS EMPTIED AND SOME OF THE MEN WERE MOVED 
THERE.  THE ICRC WAS TOLD THESE MEN WERE REFUGEES, 
NOT PRISONERS.  ALSO, ABOUT 15 REGULAR PRISONERS WERE 
TAKEN AWAY TO A BUNKER EVERY TIME THE ICRC VISITED. 
THESE WERE 14 CIVILIANS AND ONE SOLDIER, A MAN NAMED 
NEDIM MOSTAREVIC.  BEFORE EACH VISIT THE GUARDS WOULD 
ALSO REMOVE ABOUT 150 PEOPLE (CHILDREN AND MEN OVER

55) AND HIDE THEM IN A DISTANT FIELD.  THE NAME OF 
THE CAMP WAS ALSO CHANGED FROM \"CONCENTRATION CAMP 
BATKOVIC\" TO \"COLLECTIVE CENTER BATKOVIC\".  THIS 
BECAME VERY IMPORTANT, SINCE MEN WHO RECEIVED MAIL 
FROM THE RED CROSS WITH THE WRONG ADDRESS WERE 
SEVERELY BEATEN  ONCE THE MEN WERE REGISTERED BY THE 
ICRC, THEY WERE CONFIDENT THEY WOULD NOT BE KILLED, 
BUT THEY WERE STILL BEATEN REGULARLY.

RELEASED IN A PRISONER EXCHANGE.

METERS FROM THE FARM ALONG A BROOK.  HE SAID THE 
DIMENSIONS WERE THREE TO FOUR METERS WIDE BY 30 
METERS LONG BY TWO METERS DEEP.  CORPSES OF MEN, 
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT TO THE PIT AND 
THEN COVERED WITH A WHITE SUBSTANCE FROM 20 KILO 
DRUMS.  HE THOUGHT IT WAS SOME KIND OF 
PESTICIDE.  IT HAD A STRONG ODOR OF CHLORINE. 
AFTER UNLOADING, THE TRUCK DRIVERS WOULD CLEAN 
OUT THE TRUCKS AT A FIRE HYDRANT AT THE FARM. 
WHEN THE PIT WAS FULL, THE SERBS BROUGHT A FRONT 
END LOADER AND COVERED IT WITH DIRT.  THEN, HE 
SAID, THEY BROUGHT MATERIAL FROM THE RUINS OF 
THE BRCKO MOSQUE TO COVER THE DIRT.  FINALLY, 
THEY ADDED ANOTHER LAYER OF DIRT FROM A NEARBY 
HILL, ROLLED THE GRAVE FLAT, AND PLANTED GRASS.

200 OR MORE BODIES AT THIS LOCATION.

ED ABOVE THAT, BEFORE THEY STARTED USING 
THE PIT, THEY HAD TRANSPORTED BODIES TO A PLACE 
WHERE THE BONES OF ANIMALS WERE INCINERATED TO 
PRODUCE CATTLE FEED.  THEY USED THIS INCINERATOR 
AS LONG AS COAL WAS AVAILABLE.  ABOUT 100 METERS 
BEHIND THIS LOCATION WAS THE BRCKO TOWN GARBAGE 
DEPOT AND A CANAL DOWN TO THE SAVA RIVER.  THE 
WITNESS SAID IT WAS RUMORED THAT THERE MIGHT BE 
ANOTHER MASS GRAVE UNDER THE GARBAGE, BUT HE HAD 
NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THIS.

HEAD.  A MAN NAMED GORAN JELISIC WHO WAS CALLED THE 
\"SERBIAN ADOLF\" THEN SHOT KRSO TO DEATH WHILE SEKA 
TOOK A PHOTO.  THE WITNESS SPECULATED THAT THE CAP 
WAS PUT ON KRSO TO MAKE IT LOOK IN THE PHOTO AS IF HE 
WERE A SOLDIER. 
 
6.  (U) NEXT, A MAN WITH A MOUSTACHE WHOM THE WITNESS 
DID NOT KNOW ORDERED HIM AND ANOTHER YOUNG MAN TO GO 
IN FRONT OF THE POSAVINA HOTEL TO COVER UP TWO DEAD 
BODIES.  ONE OF THE BODIES WAS ON ITS BACK.  THE 
WITNESS COULD SEE THAT THE VICTIM\'S THROAT HAD BEEN 
CUT AND HIS PENIS CUT OFF.  THE OTHER BODY (ALSO A 
MAN) WAS LYING FACE DOWN, SO THE WITNESS DID NOT SEE 
WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO HIM.  AFTER THE WITNESS 
AND THE 
OTHER YOUNG MAN COVERED THE BODIES WITH A TENT, THEY 
WERE ORDERED TO MOVE AWAY.  THE WITNESS QUICKLY 
WALKED BACK TOWARD THE POLICE STATION.  HE HEARD TWO 
SHOTS BEHIND HIM AND NEVER SAW THE OTHER YOUNG MAN 
AGAIN, SO HE ASSUMED THE GUARD SHOT HIM.  BACK AT THE 
POLICE STATION, HE REJOINED HIS GROUP.  A GIRL NAMED 
VIOLETA, WHO WAS SEKA\'S DAUGHTER, LINED THE GROUP UP 
AND MADE THEM SING A SONG ABOUT A TURKISH WOMAN WHO 
SAID IN FRONT OF A MOSQUE THAT SHE HAD ONLY LOVED A 
SERB.

STATION AND WERE FORCED TO LOOK AT THE SERBIAN FLAG 
WHILE A MAN NAMED GORAN JELISIC BEAT THEM WITH A 
RUBBER TRUNCHEON.  THE WITNESS REMEMBERED GORAN\'S ARM 
WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM HIS VICTIMS.  VIOLETA

GORAN REPLIED, \"I WON\'T LEAVE BRCKO UNTIL I KILL 500.\" 
 
8.  (LOU) AT THIS POINT, FIVE OF THE WITNESS\'S FORMER 
SERB FRIENDS (PROTECT -- SEE PARA 24 FOR 
IDENTIFICATION) ENTERED AND ASKED GORAN IF THEY COULD 
HAVE FIVE MEN TO KILL.  WHEN GORAN SAID YES, ONE OF 
THEM SELECTED THE WITNESS, ELVEDIM SALKANOVIC, MIRSA 
KORENIC, ADAN AHMEDOVIC, AND MELI HAMIDOVIC.  THEY 
ALL WERE PUT IN A CAR AND TAKEN TO AN APARTMENT IN 
THE \"S\" SETTLEMENT (A NEIGHBORHOOD IN 
BRCKO).  IN THE APARTMENT WERE FIVE OR SIX BRCKO 
SERBS INCLUDING TWO POLICEMEN (PROTECT - SEE PARA 24 
FOR NAMES).  AS IT TURNED OUT, THEY DID NOT WANT TO 
KILL THE WITNESS AND THE OTHERS, BUT WERE COVERTLY 
TRYING TO SAVE THEIR LIVES.  THE WITNESS BEGGED THEM

WHICH THEY DID.  TWO OTHER SERBS (IDENTIFIED IN PARA

REACHED THE PLATEAU IN FRONT OF LUKA THEY LAY THE 
BODIES THERE.  GORAN THEN ORDERED ONE OF THE 
PRISONERS TO BEND DOWN AND LICK THE BLOOD OFF OF ONE 
OF THE CORPSES AND, AS THE PRISONER DID SO, GORAN 
SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD.  ANOTHER ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN 
THEN GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND BEGGED GORAN NOT TO 
KILL HIM BECAUSE HE HAD A LITTLE DAUGHTER.  GORAN 
KILLED HIM ON THE SPOT.  THE WITNESS AND THE FOURTH

APPROXIMATELY 50 PRISONERS.  THEY HAD FOAM MATS TO 
SLEEP ON.  THE FIRST NIGHT, THE CETNIKS TOOK OUT SOME 
PRISONERS WHO DID NOT RETURN.  THEY BEAT OTHERS 
INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE.  DURING THIS PERIOD IN LUKA, 
\"WEEKEND CETNIKS\" WHO COULD BE RECOGNIZED BY THEIR 
ACCENTS WOULD COME IN FROM SERBIA TO ABUSE THEM.  ALL

RECANOVIC; MILA GATAREVIC (AKA BOLERO); THE ILIC 
BROTHERS (GROZDAN, ZORAN, AND GORAN) AND THEIR 
FATHER, NIKOLA.  ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, UROSEVIC

AND CLEANING WORK IN THE DFZ (SEE PARA 24 FOR THE 
NAMES OF THOSE GIRLS THE WITNESS COULD IDENTIFY). 
THEY ALSO HAD TO SUBMIT TO THE SEXUAL DEMANDS OF THE 
\"CETNIKS.\"  THESE GIRLS WERE FROM 12 TO 23 YEARS 
OLD.  ONCE, THE WITNESS HAD TO CLEAN ON OF THE \"SEX 
ROOMS.\"  HE SAID THE BED WAS SOAKED WITH BLOOD. 
WITNESS DARED NOT BE SEEN TALKING TO THESE GIRLS, SO

THE OTHER \"CETNIKS\" IN THIS \"RITUAL.\"  AS HE AND HIS 
BROTHER REACHED THE WAREHOUSE, THE WITNESS WAS 
STOPPED BY ZORAN (LNU) FROM BRCKO WHO ASKED ABOUT A 
GIRL HE HAD LIKED IN SCHOOL, AMELA OMEROVIC.  WHEN 
THE WITNESS SAID HE DID NOT KNOW HER WHEREABOUTS, 
ZORAN BEAT THE WITNESS AND HIS BROTHER ON THE HEAD 
AND IN THE KIDNEYS.  IN THE MORNING, THE NEW 
PRISONERS WERE TAKEN TO HAVE THEIR HEADS SHAVED, AND 
THEIR LIVES IN BATKOVIC BEGAN. 
 
20.  (U) FOR THE FIRST MONTH OR TWO, THERE WERE 
REGULAR BEATINGS, ESPECIALLY OF WHAT THE \"CETNIKS\" 
CALLED \"EXTREME CASES.\"  THESE INCLUDED A 14-YEAR-OLD 
BOY WHO WAS ACCUSED OF CUTTING THE EYES OUT OF SERBS; 
A TOOLMAKER ACCUSED OF MAKING KNIVES; AND A 
BODYBUILDER WHO, APPARENTLY, WAS BEATEN JUST BECAUSE 
HE WAS SO WELL BUILT.  DURING THIS TIME, ONE WOULD BE 
BEATEN JUST FOR LIFTING ONE\'S HEAD.  THE WORST 
ABUSERS WERE:  ZORAN (LNU, FROM BIJELJINA); GLIGOR 
BEGOVIC; TOJIC (LNU); NIKOLIC (LNU); MAJOR GORAN 
(LNU, FROM GORAZDE); DZEMAL ZAHIROVIC (AKA SPAJZER, A 
GYPSY FROM ZENICA); FIKRET SMAJLOVIC (AKA PIKLE OR 
PIKLIC); OMER BRODLIC (FROM BRCKO); MERSED (LNU, FROM 
BRCKO); AND ESAD BEDRIC (AKA ESO, FROM TESANJ). 
 
21.  (U) AT THE END OF AUGUST 1992, THE ICRC VISITED 
THE CAMP.  THE PRISONERS WERE TOLD TO SAY BATKOVIC 
WAS A \"COLLECTIVE CENTER\" AND THAT THEY WERE 
RECEIVING THREE MEALS PER DAY AND WERE BEING TREATED 
WELL.  THE SERBS WOULD INFILTRATE THEIR OWN PEOPLE 
AMONG THE PRISONERS, SO NO ONE DARED COMPLAIN.  THE

WITNESS FAINTED DURING THE ICRC VISIT, AND AFTER THEY 
LEFT, GLIGOR AND PIKLIC BEAT HIM, KNOCKING OUT HIS 
TEETH.  THEY ALSO BEAT TWO OTHERS.  THE NEXT DAY, THE 
WITNESS WAS INCLUDED IN THE GROUP OF \"EXTREME CASES\" 
AND WAS TAKEN AWAY DURING FUTURE ICRC VISITS.  THE 
ICRC, ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, DID NOT CHECK THE 
LISTS REGULARLY DURING THEIR TWO VISITS PER MONTH. 
IF THEY DID CHECK, THEY WERE TOLD THE MISSING WERE 
AWAY ON LABOR DETAILS AND WOULD RETURN IN THE 
EVENING.  THIS SEEMED TO SATISFY THE ICRC OFFICIALS. 
AFTER THE ICRC LEFT, THE GUARDS WOULD BEAT PEOPLE WHO 
WROTE \"CAMP\" INSTEAD OF \"CENTER\" ON THE RETURN 
ADDRESSES OF THEIR LETTERS. 
 
22.  (U) BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 1992, MOST OF THE 
WORST GUARDS WERE REPLACED BY GOOD PEOPLE FROM THE

THE WITNESS\'S ACCOUNT 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U) AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST, THE WITNESS WAS 
HIDING WITH NEIGHBORS IN HIS HOME.  HE SAID SERB 
NEIGHBORS WOULD WARN THEM WHEN \"CETNIK\" SOLDIERS WERE 
NEARBY, BUT COULD NOT HELP THEM, BECAUSE THEY WERE 
AFRAID OF THE SOLDIERS COMMANDED BY ARKAN AND CESA. 
ON MAY 6, 1992, SERBIAN SOLDIERS CAME TO THE 
WITNESS\'S NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A TRUCK, SAYING THEY WERE 
TO TAKE EVERYONE TO A FACTORY CALLED \"LASER.\"  AT 
FIRST, THEY LOADED MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, BUT WHEN

IT BECAME APPARENT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR 
EVERYONE, THEY HAD THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN GET OFF AND 
TOOK ONLY THE MEN.  THE MEN WERE TAKEN TO THE 
RESTAURANT AT THE \"LASER\" FACTORY, WHERE THERE WERE 
ALREADY ABOUT 200 MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN.  SERB 
NEIGHBORS IN UNIFORM TOLD THEM THEY WOULD BE TAKEN TO 
CELIC AND BREZOVO POLJE THE NEXT DAY.  ON MAY 7, TWO

5.  (U) ON MAY 8, THE MEN WERE GIVEN THE CHOICE OF 
GOING TO CELIC OR BREZOVO POLJE.  MOST CHOSE CELIC, 
SINCE IT WAS IN FREE TERRITORY.  THE BUS CAME TWICE. 
THE WITNESS MANAGED TO BOARD THE BUS FOR THE SECOND 
TRIP, BUT BECAME WORRIED WHEN THEY HEADED INTO BRCKO, 
INSTEAD OF TOWARD CELIC.  THE BUSES TOOK THEM TO THE 
UKA WAREHOUSE AREA NEAR THE BRIDGE OVER THE SAVA 
RIVER.  THE WITNESS NOTICED ALL THE WINDOWS IN THE 
WAREHOUSES HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT, HE ASSUMED AS A RESULT 
OF DEMOLITION OF THE BRIDGE.  AS THE DETAINEES GOT 
OFF THE BUS, THE MEN WERE ORDERED TO THROW ALL 
PERSONAL DOCUMENTS INTO A LARGE CRATE AT THE 
ENTRANCE.  THE WITNESS SAW THREE OR FOUR SERB 
SOLDIERS AND A SERB GIRL. THE GIRL SAID SHE HAD BEEN 
SHOT IN THE CHEST BY MUSLIMS, ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED 
PERFECTLY HEALTHY.  THERE WERE ALREADY 600 TO 700 
PRISONERS IN THE WAREHOUSES. 
 
6.  (U) ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER, GORAN ENTERED WITH 
DOCUMENTS IN HIS HAND AND ANNOUNCED, \"EVERYONE WHOSE 
NAME I READ NOW WILL BE TAKEN TO BE SHOT.\"  HE THEN 
READ ABOUT 150 NAMES, ABOUT HALF OF THOSE IN THE 
WAREHOUSE.  THEN, LAUGHING, HE ANNOUNCED THEY WERE 
NOT TO BE SHOT BUT WERE TO BE SENT HOME.  THOSE WHOSE 
NAMES HE READ WERE THEN RELEASED. 
 
7.  (U) A SHORT TIME LATER, GORAN DISCOVERED THE 
IDENTIFICATION CARDS OF TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE NOT 
FROM THE BRCKO AREA.  HE ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE IN

BRCKO, AND THEY REPLIED THAT THEY WERE VISITING 
FRIENDS.  GORAN SHOUTED, \"YOU CAME TO FIGHT AGAINST 
US.\"  HE TOOK THE TWO MEN OUTSIDE AND SHOT THEM. 
 
8.  (U) ON THE FOURTH DAY, THE WITNESS WAS INCLUDED 
IN A GROUP THAT WAS TO BE RELEASED, BUT THE SOLDIERS 
SAID THEY HAD RUN OUT OF THE PROPER FORMS, SO HE WAS 
MOVED TO ANOTHER WAREHOUSE AT LUKA. 
 
9.  (U) THE WITNESS SAID THAT BETWEEN MAY 8-18 
DETAINEES, MOSTLY YOUNGER MEN, WERE SELECTED AT 
RANDOM, LINED UP AGAINST A WALL AND SHOT.  ON MAY 9, 
GORAN (\"ADOLF\") BROUGHT IN A VERY FAT MAN, ALLEGEDLY 
A CROAT CAPTURED IN BRCKO.  THE MAN\'S RIGHT EAR HAD 
BEEN CUT OFF, HE WAS CARRYING IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND. 
HE HAD A HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS LEFT HAND WITH WHICH HE 
WAS WIPING BLOOD OFF HIS HEAD.  GORAN ORDERED THE MAN 
TO SQUAT AND ASKED THE PRISONERS WHICH OF THEM WAS 
WILLING TO KILL HIM, PROFFERING A LARGE PISTOL.  NO

WHEREAFTER THE \"CETNIKS ASKED FOR FOUR VOLUNTEERS TO 
REMOVE THE BODY. 
- 
10.  (U) THE CORPSES OF MURDERED DETAINEES WERE TAKEN 
TO TWO LOCATIONS IN LUKA, THE WITNESS SAID.  ONE WAS 
A SHED NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE TOWN.  TRUCKS WOULD 
COME TO REMOVE THESE BODIES DURING THE NIGHT.  THE 
WITNESS HIMSELF CARRIED TWO BODIES TO THIS SHED ON 
MAY 10 OR 11, HELPED BY HIS NEIGHBOR, EDHEM RIBIC. 
DETAINEE WORKING PARTIES WERE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY 
SERB GUARDS.  THERE WERE ALREADY FIVE OR SIX BODIES 
IN THE SHED, HE SAID.  THE OTHER PLACE WAS ALONG THE 
RAILWAY TRACK NEAR THE WAREHOUSES.  BODIES COLLECTED 
THERE WERE LATER THROWN INTO THE SAVA RIVER.  THE 
WITNESS HELPED THREE OTHER PRISONERS CARRY ONE BODY 
TO THE SECOND COLLECTION POINT, ALSO ON MAY 10 OR

MAKE SURE THEY PUNCHED HARD.  WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT

GROUPS WOULD REGULARLY ENTER THE WAREHOUSE, AND BY 
THE GLARE OF AUTOMOBILE HEADLIGHTS WOULD SELECT AND 
BEAT MEN.  THE VICTIMS WERE TAKEN OUT IN GROUPS; 
LATER THEY WOULD CALL FOR FOUR MEN TO CARRY THE

\"VOLUNTEERS\" WOULD RETURN, HE SAID, THE OTHER HAVING 
BEEN KILLED. 
 
13.  (U) ON MAY 12, \"ADOLF\" ASKED FOR A VOLUNTEER TO

DAY AND TRIED TO BE SELECTED TO WORK FOR LOCAL MEN, 
BECAUSE THEY FED THEM WELL.  MANY OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE PRISONERS AND SAID THEY 
WERE UNHAPPY ABOUT WHAT ARKAN\'S AND CESA\'S SOLDIERS

OF BEING A SOLDIER, A BUTCHER FROM BIJELJINA, A CROAT 
NAMED ANDRIJA, AND A MAN WHO HAD ESCAPED AND

THE WITNESS

2.  (LOU) AMIR DIDIC (STRICTLY PROTECT), HEREAFTER 
REFERRED TO AS THE WITNESS, IS A BOSNIAN MUSLIM FROM 
POLANKA, A VILLAGE SOUTHWEST OF BRCKO.  HE WAS BORN MAY 
1, 1967.  HE WAS A CIVILIAN AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST BY 
BOSNIAN SERB FORCES ON MAY 19, 1992. 
 
--------------------- 
THE WITNESS\'S ACCOUNT 
--------------------- 
 
3. (U) AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST, THE WITNESS WAS DRIVING 
WITH HIS AUNT AND A FRIEND.  HE AND HIS FRIEND WERE TAKEN 
TO THE POLICE STATION IN BRCKO, WHERE THEY WAITED ONE 
HOUR BEFORE BEING TAKEN WITH 15 OTHER MEN TO A WAREHOUSE 
COMPLEX KNOWN AS LUKA WHICH WAS BEING USED AS A PRISON 
CAMP.  WHEN THEY ARRIVED, THEY WERE PUT IN A WAREHOUSE 
WITH 100-150 OTHER PRISONERS WHO WERE SINGING \"CETNIK\" 
SONGS.  THEY WERE SEARCHED, AND THEIR VALUABLES WERE 
TAKEN.  THEY WERE TAKEN ONE BY ONE FOR INTERROGATION BY 
POLICE INSPECTORS.  THIS INITIAL INTERROGATION WAS 
RELATIVELY NORMAL.  BECAUSE WITNESS WAS FROM THE FREE 
TERRITORY, HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE ARMY OF

BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA.  AFTERWARDS, HE WAS RETURNED TO THE 
WAREHOUSE. 
 
4.  (U) AFTER ALL 15 MEN HAD BEEN QUESTIONED, BOSNIAN 
SERBS CAME INTO THE WAREHOUSE AND BEGAN BEATING THEM. 
THESE (SERBS) INCLUDED GORAN JELISIC FROM BIJELJINA, 
MONIKA (LNU) FROM BRCKO, RANKO (LNU) FROM BRCKO, IVAN 
(LNU) FROM BIJELJINA, AND SEVERAL OTHERS FROM BIJELJINA. 
ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, THE FOUR NAMED ABOVE DID MOST 
OF THE KILLING IN LUKA.  HE DESCRIBED RANKO AS TALL AND 
MUSCULAR, WITH BLACK HAIR; AND MONIKA AS 18 OR 19 YEARS 
OLD, SHORT, NICE-LOOKING, WITH BLACK SHOULDER-LENGTH 
HAIR.  (NOTE: THE BRCKO MUNICIPALITY WAR CRIMES 
COMMISSION IN MAOCA HAS PHOTOS OF MONIKA AND INFORMATION 
THAT SHE OPENED A BOUTIQUE CALLED \"MONIKA\" IN BIJELJINA 
AFTER MARRYING GORAN JELISIC.  END NOTE.) 
 
5.  (U) AFTER BEATING THE PRISONERS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, 
THE SERBS LEFT THE WAREHOUSE.  BY THEN IT WAS GETTING

DARK.  THEN PRISONERS WERE CALLED OUT OF THE WAREHOUSE 
ONE BY ONE AND BEATEN.  THE WITNESS AND ANOTHER PRISONER 
NAMED ANDRIJA TUFEKCIC WERE THE MOST BADLY BEATEN, BUT 
THE WITNESS DID NOT KNOW WHY.  THEY WERE BEATEN WITH 
BOTTLES AND A FIRE HOSE NOZZLE.  SUCH BEATINGS CONTINUED 
FOR 10 DAYS.  THE WITNESS SHOWED SCARS ON HIS HEAD HE

SAID WERE CAUSED BY THESE BEATINGS. 
 
6.  (U) THE WITNESS SPENT TWO MONTHS AT LUKA, WHERE 
BEATINGS WERE A DAILY OCCURRENCE.  HE SAID THAT IF A 
PRISONER HAD TO GO TO THE TOILET, HE WOULD ALWAYS RET 
URN 
BLOODY.  MONIKA, IN ONE CASE, POURED HYDROCHLORIC ACID ON 
ANDRIJA TUFEKCIC.  MONIKA, HE SAID, WAS ALSO KNOWN TO 
CASTRATE PRISONERS, SOMETIMES WITH BROKEN BOTTLES.  SOME 
PRISONERS WERE KILLED EVERY NIGHT, OFTEN BY SOLDIERS 
RETURNING FROM THE FRONT.  ON JULY 8 OR 9, ALL THOSE HELD 
PRISONER IN THE WITNESS\'S WAREHOUSE WERE TRANSFERRED ON 
10 BUSSES TO BATKOVIC PRISON CAMP. 
 
7.  (U) AT BATKOVIC, THE WITNESS SAID, GLIGOR (LNU) WAS 
ABSOLUTELY THE CRUELEST GUARD.  A FELLOW PRISONER CALLED 
SPAJZER ALSO ADMINISTERED SOME OF THE WORST BEATINGS. 
THE CAMP COMMANDER WAS NAMED VELJO. 
- 
8.  (U) WHEN THE WITNESS ARRIVED AT BATKOVIC THERE WERE 
ALREADY AT LEAST 600 PRISONERS THERE.  (NOTE:  THE 
WITNESS SAID THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PRISONERS DURING HIS 
TIME AT BATKOVIC WAS ABOUT 1700.  END NOTE.)  UPON 
DISEMBARKING FROM THE BUSSES, THE PRISONERS HAD TO ENTER 
THE CAMP BETWEEN TWO ROWS OF \"CETNIKS\" WITH CLUBS, WHO 
BEAT THEM.  IN THE WAREHOUSE, THE EARLIER ARRIVALS WERE 
LYING FACE DOWN, THEIR HANDS BEHIND THEIR HEADS AND THEIR 
HEADS SHAVED.  ALL OF THEM WERE MEN EXCEPT FOR A WOMAN 
NAMED SENA FROM BRCKO, WHO HAD INSISTED ON ACCOMPANYING 
HER HUSBAND, A ONE-LEGGED MAN WHO HAD BEEN TORTURED.

9.  (U) SOME PRISONERS DIED FROM THE DAILY BEATINGS IN 
THE CAMP.  OFTEN, SOLDIERS RETURNING FROM THE FRONT WOULD 
BE BROUGHT IN TO BEAT THE PRISONERS.  CERTAIN PEOPLE WERE 
SINGLED OUT FOR THE WORST BEATINGS, INCLUDING A SOLDIER 
NAMED NEDIM.  FOOD WAS VERY BAD, WITH ONLY ONE KILO OF 
BREAD FOR 15 PERSONS, AND A FEW SPOONSFUL OF THIN CABBAGE 
SOUP.  THERE WAS NO MEDICAL CARE, AND SOME OF THE OLD AND 
SICK DIED AS A RESULT.  THE OLDEST MAN THE WITNESS KNEW 
IN THE CAMP WAS BORN IN 1911.  ON THE HOTTEST DAYS, 
PRISONERS WERE LOCKED UP IN THE WAREHOUSES, WHERE THE 
HEAT WAS UNBEARABLE; TWO OR THREE PRISONERS WITH HEART 
PROBLEMS DIED AS A RESULT. 
 
10.  (U) EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN ICRC FIRST VISITED THE 
CAMP IN AUGUST 1992.  WHEN THE FIRST VISIT WAS ANNOUNCED, 
100-150 PRISONERS WERE HIDDEN.  THESE INCLUDED THE 13 
MOST BADLY BEATEN AND THE VERY YOUNG AND VERY OLD.  THREE 
OF THE BADLY BEATEN MEN WERE ANDRIJA TUFEKCIC AND DVEVAD 
KAMBERI, BOTH FROM BRCKO; AND ELJUB SMAJIC FROM

MONDAY, APRIL 4, A NATIONAL HOLIDAY.  IF IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE TEAM\'S ITINERARY, WE 
WILL TRY TO WORK AROUND THIS POTENTIALLY

CONTACT THE SWEDISH EMBASSY HERE TO SEE IF THEY 
HAVE ANY RECORD WHICH CAN HELP TO LOCATE HIM. 
EMBASSY STOCKHOLM MAY ALSO WISH TO SEEK SUCH

ALMOST ONE YEAR AGO.  OUR CONTACTS DID NOT KNOW 
WHERE SHE WAS NOW.

DISPLACED PERSONS AND REFUGEES ELICITED A 
RESPONSE THAT THERE ARE THOUGHT TO BE SOME 8,000 
REFUGEES IN GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PARTS OF 
CROATIA WHO CAME ORIGINALLY FROM THE BRCKO AREA. 
THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES HERE WHO WOULD HAVE COME 
FROM (AND CONTINUE TO COME FROM) THE PRIJEDOR

SUMMARY

1. THE USE OF EXTREME VIOLENCE AGAINST NON-SERBS REMAINING 
IN THE BANJA LUKA AREA OF BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA HAS 
ACCELERATED IN RECENT WEEKS.  RECENT ARRIVALS FROM THE 
REGION HAVE PROVIDED NUMEROUS EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF 
EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OF ETHNIC CLEANSING OF THE NON-SERBIAN 
POPULATION.  THESE INCLUDE WIDESPREAD KILLINGS, RAPES, 
BEATINGS, DESTRUCTION OF HOMES, ROBBERIES, HARASSMENT, AND 
FORCED FIRINGS DESIGNED TO EXPEL ALL NON-SERBS FROM THE 
AREA.  END SUMMARY.

CROSS.  MANY ARRIVE IN TATTERED CLOTHING AND CLEARLY 
SHOWING EVIDENCE OF EXTREME STRESS.  DESPITE THE SEVERITY 
AND RECENCY OF THEIR TRAUMA, MOST WERE WILLING OPENLY TO 
DESCRIBE THE HORRORS THEY HAD EXPERIENCED OR WITNESSED. 
THE EXCEPTION WAS ONE MAN WHO CAREFULLY LIMITED HIS 
REMARKS AS HE FEARED RETRIBUTION BY THE \"SERBIAN MAFIA,\" 
EVEN IF HE WERE RESETTLED OVERSEAS.

A LITANY OF CRIMES 
------------------ 
 
4. REFUGEES RECOUNTED THE FOLLOWING EYEWITNESS EXAMPLES OF 
ABUSE: 
 
     A)  TWO MUSLIM BROTHERS WERE MERCILESSLY BEATEN BY 
UNIFORMED SOLDIERS WITH BATS FASHIONED FROM WOODEN PLANKS. 
THEIR ASSAILANTS WERE KNOWN TO THEM; THEY HAD FORMERLY 
LIFTED WEIGHTS AND PLAYED SOCCER TOGETHER. 
 
     B)  A GYPSY WAS BEATEN WITH RIFLE BUTTS FOLLOWING AN 
ID CARD CHECK WHICH REVEALED THAT HE WAS NOT A SERB.

     C)  AN ELDERLY WOMAN FROM THE VILLAGE OF SEHER 
RECOUNTED THREE CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS OF HORROR.  THE FIRST 
NIGHT A GRENADE WAS THROWN IN FRONT OF A HOUSE.  THE NEXT 
NIGHT FIVE MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORMS TORTURED A NEIGHBOR IN 
HIS HOUSE FOR FOUR HOURS, CUTTING OFF BOTH HIS EARS.  THE 
THIRD NIGHT APPROXIMATELY TEN SOLDIERS CAME TO ANOTHER 
FAMILY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, RAPED AND TORTURED THE THREE 
DAUGHTERS, AND BEAT THE FATHER TO DEATH.  THE THREE 
DAUGHTERS ARE REPORTED TO HAVE DIED LATER IN THE HOSPITAL. 
 
- 
     D)  TEENAGE GIRLS WERE ADVISED BY SERBIAN FRIENDS 
THAT THEIR NAMES WERE ON LISTS OF THOSE TO BE RAPED. 
THESE FRIENDS THEN SHELTERED THEM IN THEIR HOMES FOR A FEW 
DAYS TO PROTECT THEM. 
 
     E)  IN ONE SECTION OF BANJA LUKA, CROATIAN HOUSES 
WERE BLOWN UP EVERY EVENING AT THE SAME HOUR OVER A PERIOD 
OF SEVERAL MONTHS.  THIS WAS SO RELIABLE A PRACTICE THAT 
SOME WENT OUTSIDE AT THIS HOUR TO SEE WHOSE HOUSE WOULD BE 
DESTROYED THAT EVENING.

INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
 
1.  (U) THIS IS ONE IN A SERIES OF REPORTS OF INTERVIEWS 
WITH WAR CRIMES VICTIMS CONDUCTED IN LATE 1993 IN MAOCA, 
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA BY AN OFDA (DART/ZAGREB) FIELD 
REPRESENTATIVE AND AN AMCIT IRC REPRESENTATIVE WHILE THEY 
WERE IN THE AREA ASSESSING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE NEEDS. 
THIS REPORT, LIKE THE OTHERS, NAMES  VICTIMS AND, IN SOME 
CASES, PERPETRATORS AND THE DETAILS OF SPECIFIC CRIMES. 
 
------------------- 
WITNESS INFORMATION 
------------------- 
 
2.  (LOU)  THE WITNESS, AJKUNA MUMINOVIC (STRICTLY 
PROTECT), WAS BORN SEPTEMBER 26, 1952.  SHE WAS A RESIDENT 
OF VLASENICA, A SMALL TOWN ABOUT 60 MILES BY ROAD 
NORTHEAST OF SARAJEVO, FROM 1964 TO JUNE, 1992. SHE WAS 
EMPLOYED IN A BANK AS AN OFFICE CLEANER AND MESSENGER. 
 
--------------------- 
THE WITNESS\'S ACCOUNT 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  ON JUNE 11, 1992 THE WITNESS AND HER HUSBAND 
ESCAPED FROM VLASENICA AND WENT TO CERSKA.  THERE SHE 
WORKED AS A COOK FOR THE BOSNIAN ARMY UNTIL AUGUST 21,

1992.  ON THAT DAY SHE CONVINCED HER HUSBAND TO COME WITH 
HER AND WALK TO THE VILLAGE OF SUCESKA, NEAR SREBRENICA, 
WHERE, SHE HAD HEARD, HER SON, DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND 
GRANDCHILD WERE LIVING.  SHE AND HER HUSBAND LEFT ON FOOT, 
ACCOMPANIED BY THREE OTHERS.  ON THE WAY, THEY CAME UPON A 
\"CHETNIK\" (SERBIAN ARMY) BARRICADE AND WERE FIRED ON.  THE 
WITNESS WAS SHOT IN BOTH LEGS.  HER HUSBAND AND THE THREE 
OTHERS RAN AWAY.  SHE COULD HEAR THE FIRING CONTINUING FOR 
SOME TIME.  AFTER IT STOPPED, SHE ATTEMPTED TO MOVE BUT 
COULD NOT, AND NOTICED SHE WAS LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD. 
NIGHT WAS FALLING AND SHE WAS AFRAID DOGS MIGHT COME AND 
ATTACK HER.  SHE CALLED FOR HELP THREE OR FOUR TIMES, BUT 
THEN PASSED OUT. 
 
4.  (U)  WHEN THE WITNESS REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS, SHE 
COULD HEAR THE \"CHETNIKS\" TALKING ABOUT HER.  THEY THOUGHT 
SHE WAS A MAN.  SHE TOLD THEM SHE WAS A WOMAN; THEY ASKED 
HER WHY SHE HAD NOT SURRENDERED, SINCE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE 
SHOT AT A WOMAN.  THEY SAID THEY HAD MISTAKEN HER FOR A 
SCOUT, OR SPY.  SHE INFORMED THEM SHE WAS ONLY TRYING TO 
FIND HER SON.  AFTER SOME DISCUSSION THEY TOOK HER TO THE 
ROAD, WHERE HER WOUNDS WERE BANDAGED.  SOME TIME LATER SHE 
WAS TAKEN BY CAR TO THE LOCAL CLINIC IN KRAVICA, NEAR 
BRATUNAC.  SHE WAS GIVEN INJECTIONS AND REBANDAGED AND 
TAKEN ONWARD TO A HOSPITAL IN BRATUNAC, WHERE SHE WAS 
ADMITTED AND GIVEN A BLOOD TRANSFUSION. 
 
5. (U)  AN HOUR OR SO AFTER SHE ARRIVED AT THE BRATUNAC 
HOSPITAL A SOLDIER CAME TO INTERROGATE HER.  HE ASKED 
WERE SHE WAS GOING AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING.  HE TOLD HER 
THAT IF SHE DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH HE WOULD TAKE OUT THE

TRANSFUSION AND SHE WOULD DIE.  SHE TOLD HIM WHAT SHE 
KNEW.  LATER, SHE WAS TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO ZVORNIK 
HOSPITAL, WHERE SHE WAS TREATED BY DR. ZORAN LAZAREVIC, A 
PHYSICIAN SHE KNEW FROM VLASENICA.  HE TREATED HER VERY 
KINDLY.  SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR SEVEN MONTHS, FROM 
AUGUST 21, 1992 TO MARCH 23, 1993. 
 
6. (U)  ON MARCH 23 SHE WAS TAKEN FROM THE HOSPITAL BY 
SERBIAN POLICE, WHO TOLD HER SHE WAS BEING TAKEN TO GIVE A 
STATEMENT REGARDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER INJURY. 
HOWEVER, NO STATEMENT WAS TAKEN.  INSTEAD SHE WAS TAKEN TO 
A PRISON AT NOVI IZVOR.  FIVE MEN AND FOUR OTHER WOMEN 
WERE HELD WITH HER ON THE GROUND FLOOR IN SEPARATE ROOMS. 
THEY WERE GUARDED BUT WERE ALLOWED TO USE THE TOILET, WERE 
FED, AND HAD BLANKETS AND FOAM BLOCKS FOR BEDS. FROM TIME 
TO 
 TIME OTHER \"CHETNIKS\" WOULD COME AND ASK TO SEE THE 
MUSLIMS.  THEY WOULD BEAT THE MEN; THE WOMEN COULD HEAR 
SCREAMS IN THE NEXT ROOM. 
 
7.  (U)  THE OTHER WOMEN IN THE ROOM WITH THE WITNESS WERE 
A 73-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, FATA (NFI), 65-YEAR-OLD HATA KARIC 
AND HER 11-YEAR-OLD HALF-SERBIAN GRANDDAUGHTER, ALMA.  A

16-YEAR-OLD, SUADA, WAS EXCHANGED AFTER FIVE DAYS.  HATA 
AND ALMA WERE ALLOWED VISITORS AND WERE GIVEN FAVORABLE 
TREATMENT.  THEY OFTEN DRANK COFFEE WITH THE GUARDS AND 
USED THEIR INFLUENCE TO HAVE THE WITNESS TREATED MORE 
SEVERELY. 
 
8.  (U)  THE WITNESS SAID SHE BECAME FRIENDS WITH ONE MAN, 
HASSAN (NFI), BEING DETAINED ON THE SAME FLOOR.  HATA DID 
NOT APPROVE, AND TOLD THE GUARDS HE WAS AN EXTREMIST.  AS 
A RESULT, THE WITNESS SAID, HASSAN WAS VERY BADLY BEATEN. 
HE HAD FOOTPRINTS ON HIS BODY FROM BEING STOMPED ON AND 
WAS VERY SWOLLEN  AFTER THE BEATING HASSAN WAS 
TRANSFERRED TO THE FLOOR ABOVE. 
 
9.  (U)  WHILE IMPRISONED AT NOVI IZVOR, THE WITNESS WAS 
ORDERED TO CLEAN ROOMS AND MAKE COFFEE.  WHEN SHE PLEADED 
WITH HER CAPTORS NOT TO FORCE SUCH WORK UPON HER BECAUSE 
OF PAINS IN HER WOUNDED LEGS, SHE WAS BEATEN.  SHE WAS 
INSULTED AND TOLD SHE WAS BEING TREATED WELL IN COMPARISON 
TO THE TREATMENT A SERB WOULD RECEIVE AT THE HANDS OF 
MUSLIMS. 
10. (U)  AFTER ABOUT THREE MONTHS THE WITNESS WAS PLACED 
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.  SHE BLAMED THIS ON HATA\'S 
CONTINUAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT HER.  SHE WAS HELD IN SOLITARY 
CONFINEMENT FOR ONE WEEK;  DURING THAT TIME SHE WAS GIVEN 
ONLY ONE MEAL.  SHE WAS TRANSFERRED BACK TO THE COMMON 
ROOM FOR A SHORT TIME, THEN SENT BACK TO SOLITARY 
CONFINEMENT AGAIN.  AT THE TIME OF HER ARRIVAL AT THE 
PRISON, THE PRINCIPAL GUARD WAS ONE \"DUSAN\" (NFI).  WHEN 
HE LEFT, HE WAS REPLACED BY \"MIRKO\" AND \"RATKO.\"

11.  (U)  THE WITNESS RECOUNTED HOW SHE HAD BEEN BEATEN ON 
SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  ON ONE OF THESE, SHE SAID, \"WHEN I HAD 
MADE COFFEE FOR MIRKO I MOVED HIS GUN SLIGHTLY TO PUT THE 
COFFEE DOWN.  HE YELLED AT ME AND PUNCHED ME TWICE, HARD. 
THEN HE ORDERED HASSAN BROUGHT DOWN FROM UPSTAIRS.  HE 
GAVE HASSAN A RUBBER STICK AND ORDERED HIM TO BEAT ME ON 
THE BACK.  I WAS FORCED TO STAND AGAINST A WALL.  HASSAN 
DID NOT BEAT ME HARD. THEN MIRKO TOOK THE STICK AND HIT 
HASSAN IN THE NECK HARD, TO SHOW HIM HOW HE SHOULD BEAT 
ME.\"  AS A RESULT OF THE BLOW, SHE SAID, HASSAN COULD NOT 
SPEAK FOR 3 DAYS AFTERWARDS.  UNDER THIS DURESS, HASSAN 
STRUCK HER VIOLENTLY 12 TIMES IN THE KIDNEY REGION.  AS 
HASSAN WAS ADMINISTERING THE BEATING, MIRKO SAID 
SARCASTICALLY THAT HE WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE HER HARMED, 
AND THAT IT WAS HER OWN PEOPLE WHO WERE BEATING HER. 
 
12.  (U)  AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE WITNESS WAS RETURNED TO 
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.  THREE DAYS LATER, DUSAN REAPPEARED 
AND SPOKE TO MIRKO AND RATKO.  HE CAME TO THE WITNESS\'S 
ROOM BRINGING TWO YOUNG BOSNIANS, 17 AND 18 YEARS OLD, WHO 
HAD BEEN CAPTURED FLEEING FROM CERSKA TO TUZLA.  THE TWO 
BOYS WERE VERY FRIGHTENED, THE WITNESS SAID. 
 
13.  (U)  THE WITNESS SAID DUSAN ORDERED HER AND THE TWO 
BOYS TO REMOVE ALL THEIR CLOTHES.  HE FORCED HER TO BEND 
OVER AND ORDERED ONE OF THE BOYS TO SODOMIZE HER WHILE 
FORCING HER TO PERFORM ORAL SEX ON THE OTHER.  WHEN SHE 
COMPLAINED OF INTENSE PAIN IN HER INJURED LEGS, DUSAN 
ALLOWED HER TO LIE DOWN BUT CONTINUED TO FORCE THE TWO 
YOUNG BOSNIANS TO VIOLATE HER, BOTH ORALLY AND VAGINALLY. 
AFTER SOME TIME, SHE SAID, DUSAN ASKED THE TWO BOYS IF

THEY WERE SATISFIED, AND SAID HE WOULD COME BACK THE NEXT 
DAY WITH TWO OTHER MEN. 
14.  (U)  AT ABOUT 1:00 A.M. THAT MORNING MIRKO CAME INTO 
HER ROOM.  HE SAT IN A CHAIR AND ORDERED HER TO PERFORM 
ORAL SEX ON HIM.  WHEN SHE RESISTED HE RAPED HER ANALLY. 
HE TOLD HER NOT TO TELL ANYONE.  SHE BLED A GREAT DEAL AS 
A RESULT OF THIS ASSAULT, THE WITNESS SAID. 
 
15.  (U) LATER THAT MORNING MIRKO CAME INTO HER ROOM. 
SEEING THE BLOOD ON THE FLOOR, HE ASKED WHAT IT WAS.  WHEN 
SHE TOLD HIM IT WAS THE RESULT OF HIS ASSAULT ON HER 
EARLIER THAT MORNING, HE ORDERED HE 
R TO CLEAN IT UP AND 
NOT TO TELL ANYONE.  AT THIS POINT THE WITNESS, STILL 
BLOODY FROM MIRKO\'S ASSAULT, BEGAN TO MENSTRUATE.  THE 
GUARD RATKO TOLD HER TO TAKE A BATH BUT SHE DEMURRED, 
SAYING SHE COULD NOT BECAUSE OF HER PERIOD.  EVERY DAY 
THEY ORDERED HER TO TAKE A BATH AND EVERY DAY SHE REFUSED 
CLAIMING SHE WAS MENSTRUATING.  AT ONE POINT MIRKO ASKED 
HER WHAT SHE WOULD THINK WHEN DUSAN STARTED SENDING 
\"CLIENTS\" TO HER.  SHE KNEW MIRKO OWNED A CAFE, SHE SAID, 
AND SUSPECTED HE WOULD FORCE HER INTO PROSTITUTION IF SHE 
WERE TO TAKE A BATH.  THUS SHE CONTINUED TO CLAIM SHE HAD

IN JUNE 1993. 
 
16.  (U) THE WITNESS SAID SHE KNEW MIRKO AND RATKO HAD 
BEEN WOUNDED AS SOLDIERS BEFORE THEY BECAME POLICE PRISON 
GUARDS.  RATKO WAS ON TRANQUILIZERS, FOR WHICH MIRKO 
BLAMED THE MUSLIMS.  ON ONE OCCASION MIRKO TRIED TO FORCE 
THE WITNESS TO TAKE A DOSE OF THESE TRANQUILIZER PILLS; 
WHEN SHE STEPPED BACKWARD TO AVOID THIS, HE PUNCHED HER IN

HER.

BACK TO THE HOSPITAL TO HAVE THE PLATES REMOVED FROM HER 
WOUNDED LEGS.  AT THAT TIME, HOWEVER, SHE WAS GREATLY 
DISTRAUGHT, HAVING JUST LEARNED OF THE DEATH OF HER SON. 
DR. LAZAREVIC WAS KIND TO HER AND AGREED NOT TO OPERATE. 
WHEN SHE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE PRISON, DUSAN WAS ANGRY 
BECAUSE THE PLATES HAD NOT BEEN REMOVED FROM HER LEGS.  HE 
THREATENED NEVER TO EXCHANGE HER UNTIL THEY WERE REMOVED, 
BECAUSE  SUCH PLATES WERE BADLY NEEDED BY WOUNDED SERB 
SOLDIERS. IF SHE WAS RELEASED THEY WOULD BE USED ON 
MUSLIMS, HE SAID.  NONETHELESS SHE WAS EXCHANGED, WITH THE 
PLATES STILL IN HER LEGS, ON JULY 21, 1993.  SHE BELIEVES 
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN RELEASED.

INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
 
1.  (U) THIS IS ONE IN A SERIES OF REPORTS OF INTERVIEWS 
WITH WAR CRIMES VICTIMS CONDUCTED IN LATE 1993 IN MAOCA, 
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA BY AN OFDA (DART/ZAGREB) FIELD 
REPRESENTATIVE AND AN AMCIT IRC REPRESENTATIVE WHILE THEY 
WERE IN THE AREA ASSESSING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE NEEDS. 
THIS REPORT, LIKE THE OTHERS, NAMES VICTIMS AND, IN SOME 
CASES, PERPETRATORS AND THE DETAILS OF SPECIFIC CRIMES. 
 
------------------- 
WITNESS INFORMATION 
------------------- 
 
2.  (LOU)  THE WITNESS, ELMASA PRELJEVIC (STRICTLY 
PROTECT) WAS BORN ON AUGUST 17, 1943.  SHE LIVED IN 
MUJKICI IN BRCKO, WHERE SHE WORKED AS A DENTAL HYGIENIST. 
HER HUSBAND WAS NAMED SECA, AND HER SON ANIS. 
 
--------------------- 
THE WITNESS\'S ACCOUNT 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (U) WHEN THE FIGHTING STARTED IN MAY, 1992 THE WITNESS 
SAID, SHE HID IN THE BASEMENT OF HER HOUSE, WITH EIGHT 
OTHER WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND SEVEN MEN.  AFTER HIDING FOR 
                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE

FIVE DAYS, THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY FIVE OR SIX SERB 
SOLDIERS.  THIS WAS ON MAY 7, 1992.  ONE OF THE MEN HIDING 
IN THE BASEMENT, GALIB BEGOVIC, HAD A PISTOL;  HE TRIED TO 
SURRENDER IT TO ONE OF THE SERBIAN SOLDIERS.  THE 
COMMANDER OF THE SERBIAN SOLDIERS WAS NAMED MAUZER. 
MAUZER WAS CARRYING A \"SCORPION\" GUN.  FROM A HALF A METER 
AWAY HE SHOT GALIB BEGOVIC IN THE HEAD, \"BLOWING HIS 
BRAINS EVERYWHERE,\" THE WITNESS SAID. 
 
4.  (U) ONE \"CHETNIK\" (SERBIAN SOLDIER), MIRKO BLAGEVIC, 
LINED UP THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN AGAINST A WALL.  MAUZER 
TOOK THE REST OF THE MEN OUT OF THE HOUSE, AND KILLED 
THEM, INCLUDING THE WITNESS\'S HUSBAND AND SON.  ANOTHER 
MAN MURDERED WAS OMER CAUSEVIC.  THE BODIES LAY IN FRONT 
OF THE HOUSE FOR FIVE DAYS.  THE FAMILIES WERE NOT ALLOWED 
TO BURY THEM.  THE WITNESS THINKS THEY WERE LATER PUT IN A 
MASS GRAVE. 
 
5.  (U) THE WITNESS SAID THAT DURING HER YEAR UNDER 
SERBIAN OCCUPATION IN BRCKO SHE WAS CONTINUALLY HARASSED 
AND CURSED AT IN THE STREETS BECAUSE OF HER RELIGION. 
DURING THAT TIME, THE WITNESS SAID, SHE SAW THE BODIES OF 
TWO OLD WOMEN WHOSE THROATS HAD BEEN CUT.  THEY HAD BEEN 
COLLECTING MONEY FOR THE MUSLIM HOLIDAY AS GOOD LUCK.  ONE 
OF THE WOMEN WAS NAMED SALIHOVIC; SHE LIVED ON PRNJAVOR 
STREET. 
 
6.  (U) IN AUGUST, 1992 THE WITNESS DISCOVERED THE BODY OF 
AN EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL, AMIRA KANJO, WHOSE MOTHER WAS A 
FRIEND OF HERS.  THE GIRL\'S THROAT HAD BEEN CUT, AND A 
MUSLIM BOOK WAS STUFFED IN HER MOUTH.  A PRAYER RUG WAS ON 
                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE

HER CHEST.  THE OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION SAID SHE COMMITTED 
SUICIDE. 
 
7.  (U) THE WITNESS SAW A SERBIAN SOLDIER KILL HER 
NEIGHBOR, MUHAMED JAKUBOVIC, A MAKER OF LEATHER BELTS AND 
HARNESS.  THE SOLDIER, NAMED KOSTA, WAS FROM BIJELJINA. 
HE ASKED MUHAMED JAKUBOVIC TO MAKE BELTS FOR HIM.  WHEN 
JAKUBOVIC WALKED KOSTA TO THE DOOR, THE SOLDIER SHOT THE 
BELTMAKER IN THE NECK; WHEN JAKUBOVIC FELL TO THE GROUND, 
KOSTA CUT HIS THROAT.  JAKUBOVIC\'S SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD SON, 
MUHAREM, ALSO WITNESSED THE MURDER. 
 
8.  (U) THE WITNESS TESTIFIED THAT ONE DAY IN THE STREET 
SHE SAW A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF DEAD BODIES.  SHE SAID SHE 
COUNTED FIFTY CORPSES IN THE SPACE OF ONE BLOCK.  SHE ALSO 
HEARD SOLDIERS KILL A MAN NAMED MELVUDIN WHOM SHE KNEW. 
SHE SAID SHE SAW MELVUDIN ONE DAY, WALKING DOWN THE STREET 
CARRYING JERRY CANS OF WATER.  A GROUP OF SERB SOLDIERS 
STOPPED HIM AND ASKED FOR A DRINK, WHICH HE GAVE THEM. 
THEN T 
HEY FORCED HIM TO GO BEHIND A BUILDING AND SHE HEARD 
GUNFIRE.  AFTER THE SOLDIERS HAD GONE, THE WITNESS SAW 
MELVUDIN\'S CORPSE LYING IN THE STREET.

1.  FOLLOWING IS OUR CONTRIBUTION FOR THE ANNUAL 
CSCE IMPLEMENTATION REPORT (REFTEL). 
 
------------------ 
GENERAL ASSESSMENT 
------------------ 
 
2.  CROATIA CONTINUES BY AND LARGE TO IMPLEMENT 
ITS CSCE OBLIGATIONS, THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN 
SOME INCIDENTS IN VIOLATION OF CSCE NORMS.  THE 
CONTINUED PREVALENCE OF UNSETTLED CONDITIONS -- 
WAR, A HOSTILE OCCUPATION AND EFFECTIVE CIVIL 
WAR, AND MAJOR REFUGEE FLOWS -- COMPLICATES THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S TASK AND MAKES THE SECURITY BASKET 
ONCE AGAIN THE MAIN FOCUS OF DEVELOPMENTS THIS 
YEAR. 
 
3. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SECURITY AREA, INCLUDING 
ESPECIALLY THE SIGNING OF A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH 
NEIGHBORING BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA IN THE FIRST 
QUARTER OF 1994, REFLECTED THE PURSUIT OF 
RESPONSIBLE SECURITY POLICIES.  BEFORE THAT 
THERE WERE, HOWEVER, SOME CASES OF CROATIAN 
MILITARY OPERATIONS THAT VIOLATED CSCE NORMS. 
 
4. ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF CROATIA\'S TERRITORY IS 
STILL MILITARILY OCCUPIED BY REBEL ETHNIC SERB 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

FORCES THAT HAVE STRONG LINKS TO THE GOVERNMENT 
OF THE \"FRY.\"  THE POLICING OF THE OCCUPIED 
AREAS BY THE UN PROTECTION FORCE (UNPROFOR) HAS 
NOT SUCCEEDED COMPLETELY IN PREVENTING MILITARY 
ATTACKS ON CROATIA FROM WITHIN THOSE AREAS, NOR 
THE ABUSE AND HARASSMENT OF ETHNIC MINORITIES. 
THE NUMBER OF NEW REFUGEES FLOWING INTO CROATIA 
DIMINISHED SOMEWHAT DURING THE YEAR, BUT THERE 
HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL NUMBERS OF 
REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS IN THE COUNTRY 
WHO MUST BE CARED FOR. 
 
5. IN OTHER CSCE AREAS, THERE WERE NO MAJOR 
DEVELOPMENTS THIS YEAR.  KEY FEATURES OF THE 
LANDSCAPE ARE CONTINUED BUT SLOW PROGRESS TOWARD 
ECONOMIC PRIVATIZATION, MUCH SLOWED BY THE 
UNCERTAIN INVESTMENT CONDITIONS; AND A GENERAL 
RESPECT FOR THE PRINCIPLES EMBODIED IN THE HUMAN 
DIMENSION, MARRED BY CONTINUING PROBLEMS 
CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES AND PRESS 
FREEDOMS, IN PARTICULAR. 
 
-------- 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
6. SECURITY ISSUES DOMINATE ALL OTHER MATTERS IN 
CROATIA, DUE TO THE CONTINUING MILITARY 
OCCUPATION OF LARGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BY 
BREAKAWAY ETHNIC SERBS.  IN 1993, THE UNSC 
RECOGNIZED THESE \"UN-PROTECTED AREAS\" (UNPAS) AS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01327  01 OF 03  011807Z 
INTEGRAL PARTS OF CROATIA.  CROATIA CONTINUED TO 
COOPERATE IN INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO NORMALIZE 
THE UNPAS AND RETURN THEM TO CROATIAN GOVERNMENT 
CONTROL, BY PEACEFUL MEANS, IN PARTICULAR BY 
PROLONGING ITS AGREEMENT TO THE PRESENCE OF UN 
PEACEKEEPING TROOPS AND BY COOPERATING IN OTHER 
EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR A PEACEFUL 
APPROACH TO THE RETURN OF THE UNPAS (SEE 
BELOW).  THERE WERE ALSO BREACHES, HOWEVER, 
NOTABLY IN CROATIAN ATTEMPTS IN SEPTEMBER 1993 
TO RETAKE BY FORCE CERTAIN SERB-CONTROLLED AREAS 
AROUND MEDAK.  IN ADDITION TO MANY CASUALTIES ON 
BOTH SIDES, THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF THE TORTURE 
AND MURDER OF SERB CIVILIANS, THE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION OF WHICH HAS NOT YET 
BEEN COMPLETED.  CROATIA HAS NOW ENTERED INTO 
SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS, WHICH WERE UNDER WAY AS 
THE REPORTING PERIOD CLOSED, FOR A CEASEFIRE 
WITH THE SERBS WHO CONTROL MOST OF THE UNPAS. 
 
7.  INTERNATIONALLY, CROATIA SIGNED AN AGREEMENT 
IN MARCH 1994 THAT WILL HELP BRING PEACE TO THE 
FORMER YUGOSLAVIA BY ESTABLISHING A CROAT-MUSLIM 
FEDERATION IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AND A 
CONFEDERATION BETWEEN THE B-H FEDERATION AND 
CROATIA.  CROATIA HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE

NATO PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE PROGRAM.  ALSO IN THE 
FIRST QUARTER OF 1994, THE CROATIAN GOVERMENT 
COOPERATED IN BRINGING ABOUT A CEASEFIRE BETWEEN 
ETHNIC CROATIAN AND MUSLIM FORCES IN 
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, THUS HELPING TO REDUCE 
VIOLENCE.  A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE SAME AREA, 
HOWEVER, HAS BEEN THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT\'S 
CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE OF A PRACTICE BY WHICH 
CROATIAN REGULAR TROOPS WERE INVOLVED IN 
FIGHTING IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA. 
 
8. CROATIA COOPERATES IN THE UN EFFORT TO 
ENFORCE A NO-FLY ZONE OVER B-H AND CONSISTENTLY 
GRANTS OVERFLIGHT CLEARANCE FOR AIRCRAFT 
INVOLVED IN THAT EFFORT.  IT HAS, HOWEVER, 
ITSELF VIOLATED THE NFZ.  INFORMATION PROVIDED

9.  CROATIA CONTINUES TO MOVE, ALBEIT SLOWLY, 
AWAY FROM THE SYSTEM OF STATE OWNERSHIP THAT 
PREVAILED UNTIL 1991 TOWARD A FREE-MARKET 
SYSTEM.  PRIVATIZATION CONTINUES, THOUGH MOST 
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ON A SMALL SCALE.  PROGRESS 
HAS BEEN UNEVEN AND SLOW BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT

HAS BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE WAR AND ITS 
EFFECTS, SO THAT MANY NEW RULES AN LAWS REMAIN 
TO BE PASSED.  FORMER EXPORT MARKETS REMAIN 
LARGELY CLOSED OFF AND HAVE NOT BEEN REPLACED, 
AND THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE INTERNATIONAL 
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  AS A RESULT, ECONOMIC 
RECOVERY HAS BEEN BLOCKED AND THE AVERAGE 
STANDARD OF LIVING REMAINS AT LEAST 50 PERCENT 
BELOW ITS PRE-1991 LEVEL.  FURTHER, THE 
UNCERTAIN SECURITY SITUATION HAS PROBABLY CAUSED 
INVESTORS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN, TO 
POSTPONE THEIR DECISIONS. 
 
10.  A NEW ECONOMIC TEAM INSTALLED BY PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN INTRODUCED IN OCTOBER 1993 MEASURES THAT 
LARGELY HALTED THE RAMPANT INFLACTION PREVAILING 
LAST YEAR, AND THIS HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT 
CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THE ECONOMIC 
SITUATION.  CROATIA REMAINS A MEMBER OF THE 
WORLD BANK, IMF, AND ETRD AND HAS RECEIVED 
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS TO 
HELP STRENGTHEN ITS FREE MARKET BASE.  THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS OBTAINED U.S. AND EUROPEAN UNION 
SUPPORT FOR EVENTUAL CLOSER ASSOCIATION WITH 
WESTERN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. 
 
11.  BECAUSE OF UNSETTLED CONDITIONS AND HIGHER 
PRIORITIES, CROATIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
POLICY REMAINS IN ITS INFANCY BUT FOLLOWS IN 
PRINCIPLE THE LINES OF WESTERN PRACTICE.

12.  CROATIA HAS ENACTED MOST OR ALL OF THE 
LEGAL STRUCTURES OF A PLURALISTIC, DEMOCRATIC 
SOCIETY.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO 
HAVE LEFT THIS MACHINERY TO OPERATE ON ITS OWN, 
AND HAS NOT BEEN ACTIVE IN EXTENDING ITS 
PRACTICAL AND FAIR APPLICATION, NOR AGGRESSIVE 
IN ENSURING THAT ABUSES ARE AVOIDED. 
 
13.  ELECTIONS IN EARLY 1993 WERE GENERALLY 
CONSIDERED FAIR AND OPEN BY BOTH OUTSIDE AND 
DOMESTIC OBSERVERS AS WELL AS THE PARTICIPANTS. 
BUT DEMOCRATIC, PLURALISTIC INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT 
YET AS ROBUST AS IN OLDER WESTERN SOCIETIES. 
THE SABOR (PARLIAMENT), FOR EXAMPLE, HAS LITTLE 
       EFFECTIVE POWER TO CHALLENGE THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE REPUBLIC.  FEW CONCRETE STEPS HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN TO ADVANCE THE AGENDA OF GREATER PLURALISM

14.  CROATIA SHOWS A STRONG RESPECT, IN LETTER 
AND IN PRACTICE, FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND 
INCREASING INTERCHANGE WITH WESTERN EUROPEAN 
SOCIE 
TIES HAS BROUGHT A GREATER AWARENESS OF 
GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS IN THIS REGARD.  THE 
GOVERNMENT USUALLY TAKES ACTION TO INVESTIGATE 
AND/OR PROSECUTE SERIOUS ABUSES, BUT RESPONSE 
CAN BE SLOW AND INEFFECTIVE.  MINORITIES IN 
CROATIA -- IN PARTICULAR THE ROUGHLY 11 PERCENT . 
SERB MINORITY -- HAVE BEEN SUBJECT, AGAIN IN 
1993, TO CRIMES OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY 
NATIONALIST EXTREMISTS.  SERBIAN REPRESENTATIVES 
ALSO COMPLAIN THAT THEY SUFFER DISCRIMINATION 
AND HARASSMENT IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AREAS, FROM 
ABNORMAL SLOWNESS IN THE ISSUANCE OF GOVERNMENT 
DOCUMENTS TO DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING AND FIRING.

INFLUENCE OVER MOST MEDIA, BUT THE PRESS 
NEVERTHELESS WILL AND DOES PRINT MATERIAL

16.  CROATIA HAS AN ORGANIZED AND EFFECTIVE

FAIR AND REASONABLE STANDARD, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT 
YET FREE OF ETHNIC BIAS OR POLITICAL INFLUENCE.

IN ZENICA FOR THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT.  HE IS THE 
SENIOR GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE REGION. 
FORMERLY A PROFESSOR OF MARXIST PHILOSOPHY AT THE 
LOCAL UNIVERSITY, MINISTER DIDIC WAS PERSONABLE, 
ARTICULATE, AND INTELLIGENT.  THOUGH HE SEEMED TO 
UNDERSTAND AND SPEAK SOME ENGLISH, HE SPOKE 
THROUGH A TRANSLATOR. 
 
-------------------------- 
MINISTER\'S JOB DESCRIPTION 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER, HIS JOB IS TO 
PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF AUTHORITY IN HIS 
(ZENICA) REGION AND TO PROVIDE A \"STAIRWAY MODEL 
OF AUTHORITY TO THE GOVERNMENT IN SARAJEVO\". 
THIS WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A \"CHAIN 
OF COMMAND\". 
 
---------------- 
THE FOUR CANTONS 
---------------- 
 
3.  MINISTER DIDIC SAID THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN 
SARAJEVO HAD DIVIDED BOSNIA INTO FOUR REGIONS OR 
\"CANTONS\" (ZENICA, TUZLA, BIHAC, MOSTAR) WITH A 
MINISTER IN EACH ONE.  HE EXPLAINED THAT WHEN THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01634  01 OF 04  251057Z 
NEW GOVERNMENT WAS FORMED SIX MONTHS AGO IT WAS 
PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH (1) HELPING THE PEOPLE 
SURVIVE THE RAVAGES OF WAR, WINTER, AND 
STARVATION; (2) DEFENDING THEM AGAINST 
AGGRESSORS.  \"THESE TASKS HAVE NOW BEEN MET\", HE 
SAID. 
 
-------------------------------- 
GOVERNMENT AGENDA AND PRIORITIES 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER, RECONSTRUCTION AND 
ORGANIZATION OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS IS THE 
FIRST PRIORITY SO THAT PEOPLE AND HUMANITARIAN 
AID CAN MOVE FREELY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THE 
SECOND PRIORITY IS THE CONTINUED \"SAFETY OF THE 
CITIZENRY FROM AGGRESSION, FROM EPIDEMICS, FROM 
ANARCHY, FROM A RETURN TO HUNGER, ETC.\"  THE 
THIRD PRIORITY IS THE REBUILDING OF HOMES,

REDEVELOPMENT PLANS 
------------------- 
 
5.  THE MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT PREVIOUSLY THERE 
WERE LARGE FACTORIES BUILT IN THE BIGGER CITIES 
AND OWNED BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY.  HE SAID THE 
ONE IN ZENICA EMPLOYED 100,000 PEOPLE.  BECAUSE 
THE SURROUNDING TOWNS AND VILLAGES WERE A SOURCE 
OF CHEAP LABOR, MOST OF THE WORKERS WERE BROUGHT 
IN FROM THE VILLAGES TO WORK.  THIS DEPLETED THE 
SMALLER AREAS OF MANPOWER AND TOOK JOBS AWAY FROM 
THE CITY DWELLERS.  THE NEW GOVERNMENT WANTS TO 
CHANGE THAT.  THEY WANT THE LARGER FACTORIES TO 
BE REPLACED BY SMALLER, MORE MODERN FACTORIES SO 
THAT CITY PEOPLE CAN BE EMPLOYED.  THE VILLAGES 
IN OUTLYING AREAS WOULD THEN USE THEIR MANPOWER 
AND RESOURCES FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD 
PRODUCTION.  PERHAPS SMALLER SATELLITE FACTORIES 
WOULD ALSO BE BUILT IN THE RURAL AREAS FOR THE 
MANUFACTURE OF CLOTHING, SPAR 
E PARTS, ETC., HE 
SAID. 
 
------------------------------------ 
SOME COMMUNITY LEADERS RESIST CHANGE 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.  THE MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT THERE ARE LEADERS 
IN SOME MUNICIPALITIES WHO ARE RESISTING THE 
INITIATIVES OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM SERVING IN THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01634  02 OF 04  251057Z 
NEW GOVERNMENT AS MANY ARE SUSPECTED OF WAR 
CRIMES, PROFITEERING, AND OTHER CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITY.  THESE LEADERS ARE IN PROZOR, KISELJAC, 
AND BUSOVACA, (HVO CONTROLLED AREAS) AS WELL AS 
IN OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.  THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS 
HAVING TROUBLE REMOVING THESE LEADERS FROM THEIR 
WELL-ENTRENCHED POSITIONS OF POWER IN THE SMALLER 
COMMUNITIES. 
 
------------------------- 
SHORTAGE OF SKILLED LABOR 
------------------------- 
 
7.  THE MINISTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT FINDING 
SKILLED LABOR WILL BE A PROBLEM SINCE SO MANY 
PEOPLE LEFT DURING THE WAR.  THERE IS SOME 
ANXIETY THAT ONCE SARAJEVO BECOMES A FULLY 
FUNCTIONAL CITY AGAIN, MANY OF THE TALENTED 
PEOPLE REMAINING IN ZENICA, MOSTAR, AND THE OTHER

8.  THE MINISTER SAID THAT DURING THE TROUBLE OF 
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE SPIRIT OF THE 
BOSNIAN PEOPLE HAS REMAINED UNDAUNTED.  HE WENT 
ON TO SAY THAT MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE 
WORLD, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD AND 
APPRECIATED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT SPIRIT.  IT 
WAS U.S. SUPPORT, HE SAID, THAT GAVE THE BOSNIAN 
PEOPLE THE WILL TO CONTINUE TO RESIST AGGRESSION. 
HE SAID THE PEOPLE HAVE COMPLETELY LOST FAITH 
WITH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LIKE FRANCE, GREAT 
BRITAIN, GERMANY, AND ITALY.  HE WENT ON TO SAY 
THAT HE THOUGHT MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE 
COUNTRIES SUPPORTED THEIR CAUSE, BUT THAT THE 
GOVERNMENTS DID NOT.  HE NOTED THE \"RISE OF 
FASCISM AND RACIST INCIDENTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES\" 
AS STRONG INDICATIONS THEY WERE \"NOT LIKELY TO BE 
SYMPATHETIC TO VICTIMS OF SERB AGGRESSION IN 
BOSNIA.\"  HE SAID THAT EVEN WITHOUT THE MASSIVE 
HUMANITARIAN AID FROM THE USA, THE BOSNIAN PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE FOUND STRENGTH IN SIMPLY KNOWING THAT 
AMERICANS WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR CAUSE.  BUT

9.  ALTHOUGH THERE IS FOOD IN ZENICA NOW, THE 
HUNGER THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCED IN DECEMBER AND 
JANUARY IS STILL FOREMOST ON THEIR MINDS.  EVEN 
THOUGH THEY NOW HAVE AMPLE FOOD TO EAT, THE 
MINISTER SAID, THERE IS GREAT ANXIETY THAT THE

ZENICA IS ARABLE AND THAT MORE HAS BEEN 
CULTIVATED THIS YEAR THAN EVER BEFORE.

WAR.  NOW THERE ARE 15,000.  TWENTY PER CENT OF 
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT POSITIONS ARE DIVIDED 
EQUALLY BETWEEN THE SERB AND CROATIAN CITIZENS OF 
THE REGION.  THERE WERE 20,000 SERBS IN THE 
ZENICA REGION BEFORE THE WAR.  BETWEEN 10,000 AND 
15,000 REMAIN.   THE LEADER OF THE LOCAL ORTHODOX 
CHURCH IS THEIR SPOKESMAN.

12.  THIS VERY INFORMATIVE MEETING SHOWED THE 
MINISTER OF ZENICA TO BE A SOPHISTICATED, 
INTELLIGENT MAN WITH A FULL PLATE OF PROBLEMS AND 
PLANS TO HELP REBUILD HIS COUNTRY.  THE RETURN TO 
NORMALIZATION WILL BE A DIFFICULT ROAD, BUT THE 
BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE LOOKING BEYOND 
IMMEDIATE DIFFICULTIES AND FORMULATING PLANS FOR 
LONG-TERM REDEVELOPMENT.

2.  DURING A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TUDJMAN, DEFMIN 
SUSAK, AND DEPUTY FM SANADER, ON OTHER SUBJECTS 
(SEPTEL), AMB. GALBRAITH MADE TWO OTHER POINTS: 
 
----------------------------------------- 
CRIMINAL ACTS OF CROATIAN OCCUPYING TROOPS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  AMB. GALBRAITH SAID THAT THE DESECRATION OF GRAVES 
HE HAD WITNESSED IN KASIC (REFTEL), EVIDENTLY COMMITTED 
BY CROATIAN TROOPS WHO OCCUPIED THE VILLAGE FOR 14 
MONTHS, WAS HORRENDOUS AND UNACCEPTABLE.  BOTH CROATIAN 
OFFICIALS SOUGHT TO DENY CROATIAN RESPONSIBILITY, THEN 
TO ARGUE THAT SERBS HAD DONE MUCH WORSE THINGS AND ON A 
LARGER SCALE, TO CROATS.  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT 
THIS SORT OF DEFENSE WAS LIKE COMPARING THE ACTIONS OF 
A LEGITIMATE POLICE FORCE TO THE MAFIA;  AS A WESTERN 
DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY, CROATIA MUST EXPECT TO BE HELD TO A 
HIGH STANDARD.  MOREOVER, SUCH ACTIONS, AS A PRACTICAL 
MATTER, CREATED ILL WILL THAT WOULD MAKE REINTEGRATION 
MORE DIFFICULT WHEN THE TIME CAME.  GALBRAITH SUGGESTED 
THAT SUSAK CONSIDER GIVING SPECIAL TRAINING TO CROATIAN 
TROOPS TO SENSITIZE THEM ON THESE ISSUES.

4.  AMB. GALBRAITH ALSO INQUIRED ABOUT REPORTS THAT 
SOME 450 REFUGEES FROM THE BANJA LUKA AREA OF BOSNIA- 
HERZEGOVINA HAD BEEN HELD AT THE CONFRONTATION LINE (IN 
UNPA SECTOR WEST), REFUSED CROATIAN PERMISSION TO 
ENTER.  NONE OF THE CROATIAN OFFICIALS PRESENT WAS 
FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE.  PRES. TUDJMAN MADE A PHONE 
CALL AND REPORTED THAT THOSE REFUGEES FROM THE GROUP 
WHO HAD MEDICAL PROBLEMS HAD BEEN ADMITTED IMMEDIATELY. 
THE OTHERS WERE BEING HELD TEMPORARILY, PENDING FINDING 
PLACES FOR THEM TO GO.  THIS WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE 
CONTINUING HEAVY FLOW OF REFUGEES HAD STRAINED 
CROATIA\'S CAPACITY TO ABSORB THEM.  NEVERTHELESS, 
TUDJMAN ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT 
HAD NO INTENTION OF NOT ADMITTING THESE PEOPLE.  \"HELP 
US END THIS WAR,\" HE SAID, SO THAT SUCH PROBLEMS WOULD 
NOT OCCUR.

MISSION\'S OVERRIDING GOALS, AS SET FORTH IN REFTEL: 
 
-- MEETING EMERGENCY AND LONGER-TERM HUMANITARIAN 
RELIEF AND REFUGEE PROTECTION NEEDS IN CROATIA AND 
BOSNIA; 
- 
-- A HALT TO MILITARY SKIRMISHES, AND THE AVOIDANCE OF 
FULL-SCALE WAR, IN AND OVER THE KRAJINA, AND THE 
PEACEFUL REINTEGRATION OF THE UNPAS INTO CROATIA; 
 
-- AN END TO HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BY BOSNIAN CROAT 
FORCES AND THE EARLY PROSECUTION OF PERSONS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR COMMITTING WAR CRIMES; 
 
-- A MORE DEMOCRATIC CROATIA, MARKED BY A VIGOROUSLY 
PLURALISTIC SYSTEM, FREE MEDIA, THE RULE OF LAW, AND 
RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS AND DIGNITY OF MINORITIES; 
 
-- PROVIDING THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF CONSULAR SERVICE,

PARTICULARLY IN AREAS RELATED TO THE HUMANITARIAN 
TRAGEDY IN EX-YUGOSLAVIA, INCLUDING VISAS, PAROLE, 
REFUGEE PROCESSING, AND MEDICAL AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN 
EVACUATION. 
 
-- AN ECONOMICALLY TRANSFORMED CROATIA, WHICH REFLECTS 
PRIVATE OWNERSHIP, FREE MARKETS, A STABLE CURRENCY, AND 
MINIMAL BARRIERS TO TRADE AND INVESTMENT; 
 
-- STEADILY INCREASING SALES OF NON-MILITARY U.S. GOODS 
AND SERVICES IN CROATIA. 
 
-- IN ADDITION (AND NOT IN REFTEL), THE MISSION\'S 
RESPONSIBILITY TO REPRESENT THE U.S. IN THE CONDUCT AND 
SUPPORT OF THE REINTEGRATION TALKS BETWEEN CROATIA AND 
ITS SECESSIONIST SERBIAN MINORITY HAS BECOME OUR MAJOR

REF: (A) ZAGREB 320; (B) ZAGREB 298 (NOTAL) 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  DURING A JANUARY 24 CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR 
(REF A), FOREIGN MINISTER GRANIC HANDED OVER A GOC DRAFT 
PROPOSAL (IN ENGLISH) OF \"THE JURIDICAL AND POLITICAL 
SOLUTION FOR A PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC REINTEGRATION OF 
THE TEMPORARILY OCCUPIED PARTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 
(UNPAS) INTO THE CROATIAN CONSTITUTIONAL AND JURIDICAL 
SYSTEM\" (FULL TEXT OF PROPOSAL IN PARA 6).  GRANIC 
EXPLAINED THAT THIS WAS THE PAPER PROMISED BY PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN IN HIS MEETING WITH DOD U/S SLOCOMBE (REF B).  THE 
GOC PROPOSAL, DRAFTED AS A COUNTERPOINT TO THE Z-4 PLAN, 
REPRESENTS THE STRICT CONSTITUTIONALIST LINE STRONGLY 
PREFERRED BY THE PRESIDENT.  THIS POSITION, SIMPLY PUT, IS 
THAT \"NO POLITICAL SOLUTION SHOULD OFFER THE KRAJINA SERBS 
MORE THAN IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE UNDER THE CROATIAN 
CONSTITUTION AND LAWS IN COMBINATION WITH PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN\'S NOVEMBER 1993 PEACE INTIATIVE.\" 
- 
3.  THIS NEWEST PROPOSAL IS THEREFORE BASICALLY A RE- 
WORKED VERSION OF PREVIOUS STATEMENTS, ADOPTING SOME OF 
THE LANGUAGE FROM THE Z-4 PLAN, PARTICULARLY ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS GUARANTEES, WITH LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
GUARANTEED.  BUT THE PROPOSAL STRICTLY AVOIDS ANY 
MEANINGFUL POWER-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WHICH WOULD PERMIT 
SIGNIFICANT AUTONOMY FOR THE SERB-MAJORITY AREAS.

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00350  01 OF 05  251832Z 
 
4.  INSTEAD, THE GOC PROPOSAL WOULD FORM A NEW COUNTY 
(ZUPANIJA) FROM THE DISTRICTS AROUND GLINA (SECTOR NORTH) 
AND KNIN (SECTOR SOUTH).  THIS ZUPANIJA WOULD BE ENTITLED 
TO THE SAME POWERS OF ANY OTHER CROATIAN ZUPANIJA UNDER 
THE CURRENT LAW ON LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, WHICH UNDER 
CROATIA\'S HEAVILY CENTRALIZED FORM OF GOVERNMENT MEANS 
ESSENTIALLY ONLY ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF A VERY LOCAL 
NATURE.  THE COUNTY PREFECT  (ZUPAN) WOULD BE, AS IN OTHER 
CROATIAN ZUPANIJA, APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT TUDJMAN.  THE 
GOC PROPOSAL WOULD THEN GRANT LIMITED ADDITIONAL POWERS TO 
THE NEW ZUPANIJA (LISTED IN SECTION II.7 OF THE TEXT 
BELOW) SUCH AS LAND USE PLANNING; COORDINATION OF 
EDUCATIONAL, HEALTH, WELFARE AND INFRASTRUCTURAL NETWORKS; 
AND \"COORDINATION OF ALL MATTERS...ESSENTIAL FOR THE 
REALIZATION OF THE NATIONAL RIGHTS AND CULTURAL AUTONOMY 
OF THE SERBIAN ETHNIC COMMUNITY OR MINORITY.\" 
 
5.  COMMENT:  THE GOC SEES ITSELF NEGOTIATING FROM A 
POSITION OF STRENGTH.  NONETHELESS, WE BELIEVE TUDJMAN IS 
WILLING TO OFFER SUBSTANTIAL AUTONOMY TO THE SERBS IN 
EXCHANGE FOR CROATIAN SOVEREIGNTY OVER ALL ITS TERRITORY. 
THIS PROPOSAL MAY BE MERELY A HARD LINE OPENING GAMBIT AND 
DOUBTLESS REFLECTS ACUTE GOC CONCERN OVER THE CONTENT OF 
THE Z-4 PLAN.  IF THE GOC CONSENTED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE 
KRAJINA SERBS, ON THE BASIS OF THE Z-4 PLAN OR ON ANY 
OTHER BASIS, THEY WOULD MOST CERTAINLY PUSH TO HAVE ANY 
EVENTUAL SETTLEMENT LOOK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE LIKE THIS 
NEWEST PAPER.  FOR THEIR PART, THE KRAJINA SERBS, WHO FIND 
(WHAT THEY KNOW OF) THE Z-4 PLAN TO BE A NON-STARTER, WILL 
ONLY BE FURTHER ALIENATED BY THIS CROATIAN POSITION.  END

SUMMARY

1.  (LOU)  THE GOC\'S EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO 
\"CONSIDER\" THE Z-4 PLAN HAS HELPED CROATIA PRESENT A 
\"REASONABLE\" FACE THAT CONTRASTS FAVORABLY WITH THE 
KRAJINA SERBS\' INTRANSIGENCE.  NEVERTHELESS, CROATIAN 
OBJECTIONS TO VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN ARE DEEPLY 
HELD.  A POINT-BY-POINT REVIEW IN THE HEAVILY 
GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED \"VJESNIK\" FEBRUARY 1, WHICH 
ESSENTIALLY EVISCERATES ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN, APPEARS 
INDICATIVE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (LOU)  AFTER THE Z-4 GROUP\'S JANUARY 30 PRESENTATION 
OF ITS PLAN FOR POLITICAL REINTEGRATION OF THE SERB- 
CONTROLLED AREAS OF CROATIA, THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT 
EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO REVIEW THE PLAN AND TO 
ACCEPT IT AS A BASIS FOR NEGOTIATION.  IN LIGHT OF THE 
GOC\'S KNOWLEDGE THAT THE \"RSK WOULD FIND THE PLAN 
UNACCEPTABLE EVEN IF IT HAD AGREED TO RECEIVE A COPY OF

IT, THE CROATIAN REACTION WAS UNDOUBTEDLY CRAFTED IN 
PART TO HELP MAINTAIN THE GOC\'S IMAGE OF REASONABLENESS 
AS A SERIOUS PARTNER OF THE \"WEST,\" EXPLORING ALL 
AVENUES TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. 
 
3.  (LOU)  THE ORAL REACTIONS OF CROATIAN LEADERS, 
HOWEVER -- BEGINNING BEFORE ACTUAL PRESENTATION WITH 
PRESIDENT TUDJMAN\'S FULMINATIONS ABOUT THE PLAN AND HIS 
EXPRESS HOPE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE PRESENTED TO THE KNIN 
SERBS -- MAKE CLEAR THAT THE CROATS HAVE SERIOUS 
RESERVATIONS ON MANY ASPECTS OF THE Z-4 PLAN, MOST 
RELATING TO ITS PERCEIVED INFRINGEMENTS OF CROATIAN 
SOVEREIGNTY.  AS FM GRANIC TOLD \'DIE WELT,\' THERE 
SHOULD BE NO ELEMENTS OF A \"STATE WITHIN A STATE.\" 
(DETAILS SEPTEL.)  FURTHER, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER 
SARINIC, AFTER RECEIVING HIS COPY OF THE PLAN, NOT ONLY 
WENT PUBLIC WITH SOME RESERVATIONS, BUT CARPED ABOUT 
THE Z-4 GROUP\'S \"AUTONOMOUSLY NEGOTIATING\" WITH THE 
KRAJINA SERBS.

FEBRUARY 1 AN INITIAL PUBLIC GUIDE TO GOVERNMENT 
THINKING ON CERTAIN UNACCEPTABLE ASPECTS OF THE PLAN.

-- \"SERBIAN KRAJINA\": THE PLAN\'S USE OF THIS TERM IS 
\"COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE\" BECAUSE IT HAS NO BASIS IN 
FACT, HISTORY, OR CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. 
 
-- OVERLAPPING LEGISLATION:  THE PLAN\'S PROVISION THAT 
CROATIAN LAW WOULD PREVAIL IN THE AUTONOMOUS AREA, BUT 
THAT KNIN COULD ALSO APPROVE LAWS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE 
HONORED BY CROATIAN AUTHORITIES \"NEGATES THE BASIC 
CONDITIONS OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ONE NATION\" SO IT IS 
\"HARDLY PROBABLE\" THAT CROATIA COULD ACCEPT IT. 
 
-- FLAG AND COAT-OF-ARMS:  CURIOUSLY, GIVEN PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN\'S EARLIER RHETORIC AGAINST THESE PROVISIONS, 
VJESNIK SIMPLY REPORTS WHAT THE PLAN PROPOSES, WITHOUT 
SPECIFICALLY REJECTING IT. 
 
-- TWO EQUALLY VALID CURRENCIES:  \"DIFFICULT TO SEE 
(THIS IDEA) AS AN AFFIRMATION OF SOVEREIGNTY....\"  (THE

-- TAX AND REVENUE POLICY: THE PLAN\'S PROVISION THAT 
THE SERBS COULD RAISE AND SPEND THEIR OWN TAXES IS 
\"DUBIOUS,\" THOUGH THE PLAN LEAVES IT TO THE PARTIES TO 
WORK OUT SPECIFICS. 
 
-- SEPARATE GOVERNMENT IN THE SERB AUTONOMOUS AREA: 
\"MUCH\" OF WHAT THE PLAN PROPOSES IS \"UNACCEPTABLE.\" 
THE ARTICLE SINGLES OUT THE SUGGESTION THAT SERBS 
ELECTED TO THE SABOR FROM THE KRAJINA AND THOSE ELECTED 
ELSEWHERE IN CROATIA WOULD FORM A SINGLE PARLIAMENTARY

\"PROFESSIONAL SERBS\" RATHER THAN REPRESENTATIVES OF

-- DEFENSE:  THE PROVISION THAT THE CROATIAN ARMY COULD 
ENTER THE \"KRAJINA\" (BEYOND THE BORDER AREAS) ONLY BY

IN CROATIA (EXCEPT PERSONS SPECIFICALLY ACCUSED OF 
DEFINED WAR CRIMES) WOULD BE SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION BY 
KNIN OR ZAGREB AUTHORITIES FOR ACTS COMMITTED DURING 
THE WAR \"WILL BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTING\" TO CROATIAN 
REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS WHO SUFFERED BRUTAL SERB 
AGGRESSION (BUT THE ARTICLE DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY 
REJECT THIS CLAUSE).

5.  (LOU) THE VJESNIK PIECE AFFORDS THE CROATIAN PUBLIC 
ITS FIRST DETAILED, GOVERNMENT-AUTHORIZED LOOK AT SOME 
OF THE MORE ODIOUS (TO THE CROATS) ELEMENTS OF THE 
PLAN.  THIS CRITIQUE WILL STRIKE A BROAD AND RESPONSIVE 
CHORD AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC.  SOME OF THE SPECIFIC 
OBJECTIONS SEEM TO DENY EVEN THE ESSENCE OF TRUE LOCAL 
AUTONOMY.  IT IS CONCEIVABLE -- BARELY -- THAT THESE 
COULD BE MODIFIED IN THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS (SHOULD 
ANY EVER TAKE PLACE).  THE MOST FIRMLY STATED CONCERNS 
IN THE \"VJESNIK\" CRITIQUE, HOWEVER, ARE THOSE OF 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY IN AREAS SUCH AS DEFENSE, 
AND THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AS THE FINAL 
ARBITER OF ISSUES, EVEN IN THE \"AUTONOMOUS AREAS\"

ONE OF FAO\'S CONSULTANTS IN ZAGREB TOLD DART THAT 
THEY EXPECT TO RECEIVE 3.5 MILLION ECUS 
(APPROXIMATELY USD 4.27 MILLION) FOR THE SEED 
PROGRAM.  UNHCR\'S DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION FOR B-H 
REMARKED THAT THE REALLOCATION PUTS UNHCR IN A 
DIFFICULT POSITION, AS FAO IS SOMEWHAT OF AN 
IMPLEMENTING PARTNER IN A SENSE.  HOWEVER, UNHCR

5.   UNHCR\'S DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION FOR B-H 
REPORTED THAT THE OFFICE OF DISPLACED PERSONS AND 
REFUGEES (ODPR) IN MOSTAR HAS \"RELUCTANTLY 
AGREED\" TO ALLOW FUEL CONVOYS TO MOVE FROM 
METKOVIC THROUGH CENTRAL B-H AGAIN.  UNHCR 
SLIGHTLY REVISED THEIR DISTRIBUTION TARGETS IN 
ORDER TO PLACATE THE BOSNIAN CROATS IN THE ZENICA 
REGION WHO FELT THAT DISTRIBUTION WAS SKEWED IN 
FAVOR OF THE BOSNIAN MUSLIMS (SEE REFTELS A, B, 
AND C FOR BACKGROUND).  THE FIRST CONVOY IN 
SEVERAL MONTHS TO TRANSPORT THE INA-CONTRACTED 
FUEL FROM METKOVIC IS SCHEDULED FOR TUZLA ON FEB 
1.  (NOTE:  REFTEL C REPORTED THAT UNPROFOR HAD 
AGREED TO SUPPLY FUEL TO UNHCR FROM VITEZ UNDER A 
DEAL REACHED IN EARLY JANUARY BETWEEN THE TWO UN 
BODIES.  UNHCR\'S DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION FOR B-H 
CLARIFIED THAT THE JAN 18 FUEL CONVOY FROM VITEZ 
TO SARAJEVO WAS A \"ONE-OFF DEAL\", AND THAT THIS 
NEW BREAKTHROUGH WITH MOSTAR\'S ODPR WOULD RESTART 
THE DELIVERY OF FUEL THROUGH FEDERATION-HELD 
TERRITORY.

6.   DURING AN EU MEETING IN MOSTAR ON JAN 21, AN 
AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED BY BOTH THE CROATIAN AND 
BOSNIAC SIDES OF MOSTAR REGARDING THE HANDLING OF 
PEOPLE WHO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE CONFRONTATION LINE 
BETWEEN EAST AND WEST MOSTAR.  THE NEW POLICY 
DIFFERENTIATES BETWEEN WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN 
WHO ARE NOT OF MILITARY AGE, AND MEN OF MILITARY 
AGE AND SOLDIERS.  FOR THOSE IN THE FORMER 
CATEGORY THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE IS TO BE 
FOLLOWED:  A) AFTER ARREST THE WEU POLICE WILL BE 
INFORMED.  IF NO OTHER CRIMINAL ACT HAS BEEN 
COMMITTED, THE PERSON MAY ONLY BE HELD FOR UP TO 
2 HOURS, AND THEN MUST BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY TO 
THEIR OWN SIDE; B) IF THE ARRESTED PERSON HAS 
COMMITTED ANY OTHER CRIMINAL ACT, THE WEU POLICE 
WILL BE INFORMED AND ALLOWED TO MONITOR THE 
SUBSEQUENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  THE DETAINED

PREDICTED SHORTAGES OF BULK COMMODITIES INCLUDING 
FLOUR AND BEANS/PULSES WERE AVERTED BY AN EU

COVER SHORTAGES IN THE HI-QUALITY FOODS INCLUDING 
SUGAR, MEAT, FISH, AND CHEESE.  WFP REPORTED THAT 
FOOD STOCKS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR B-H THROUGH 
MARCH AND APRIL.  HOWEVER, WFP IS CONCERNED ABOUT

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  WHILE THE CROATIAN POLITICAL OPPOSITION HAS MOSTLY 
FALLEN IN BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION ON TERMINATING 
THE UNPROFOR MANDATE HERE, SOME PARTIES, INCLUDING THE 
SERBIAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (SNS), THE ISTRIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
(IDS) AND THE CROATIAN INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATS (HND) HAVE 
POINTED OUT THE DANGERS THAT THE GOC DECISION ON UNPROFOR 
WILL MEAN FOR CROATIA.  THESE THREE PARTIES HAVE NOT 
BOUGHT INTO THE NATIONALISTIC RHETORIC THAT HAS BEEN 
ECHOED BY THE OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES AND HDZ, AND WHICH 
HAS CLOUDED THE PROPOSALS FOR AUTONOMY FOUND IN THE Z-4 
PLAN.  HND OFFICIALS CONSIDER THE Z-4 PLAN TO BE A SOUND 
BASIS FOR FURTHER TALKS.  THE IDS CHAMPIONS REGIONAL 
AUTONOMY, BUT IS CONCERNED THAT THE Z-4 PLAN WOULD GRANT 
AUTONOMY TO SERBS WHILE OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS MUST LIVE WITH 
CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY IN ZAGREB.  END SUMMARY.

3.  ON FEBRUARY 22 THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH STIPE MESIC, 
PRESIDENT OF THE CROATIAN INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATS (HND) WHO 
SAID THAT HE CONSIDERS THE Z-4 PLAN TO BE A SOUND BASIS 
FOR FURTHER TALKS.  BROAD AUTONOMY AND DEMILITARIZATION, 
HE BELIEVES, ARE A NECESSARY CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE 
FOR SERBS TO AGREE TO REINTEGRATION.  HE CITED EVIDENCE OF 
CROATIAN WAR CRIMES -- THE PLANNED DESTRUCTION OF SERB 
HOUSES AND THE INABILITY OF THE POLICE TO FIND THE 
PERPETRATORS, AS WELL AS THE ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT OF 
TUDJMAN\'S CHIEF BODYGUARD IN THE MURDER OF A SERB FAMILY 
IN THE ZAGREB SUBURBS -- AS A MAJOR FACTOR IN SERB 
DISTRUST OF THE GOC.  HE SAID THAT THE GOC ATTEMPT TO 
LIMIT THE RIGHT TO DUAL CITIZENSHIP TO CROATS ONLY IS 
UNWORKABLE, THAT RIGHT MUST BE APPLIED TO SERBS, ITALIANS, 
AND OTHER MINORITIES ON AN EQUAL BASIS. 
 
4.  MESIC THINKS TUDJMAN WILL CONSIDER A REVISED UNPROFOR 
MANDATE (UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME) WHEN HE REALIZES THAT 
MILOSEVIC IS PLAYING TRICKS.  MESIC SAID THAT TUDJMAN\'S 
VISION OF AN ETHNICALLY PURE GREATER CROATIA IS 
FUNDAMENTALLY AT ODDS WITH MILOSEVIC\'S GREATER SERBIA. 
MESIC THOUGHT THAT A NEW MANDATE WOULD BUILD TRUST BETWEEN 
SERBS AND CROATS AND FACILITATE REINTEGRATION IF IT 
PROVIDED A SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR CROATIA\'S SERBS AND THE 
RETURN OF DISPLACED PERSONS, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED 
CONTROL OF CROATIA\'S BORDERS.  HE VIEWED TERMINATION OF 
THE MANDATE AS A POINTLESS MOVE WHICH WOULD SERVE TO UNDO 
ALL THE GAINS ACHIEVED UNDER THE ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE 
BUILDING MEASURES AGREEMENT BETWEEN ZAGREB AND KNIN.

5.  IN ONE OF THE FEW FAVORABLE PRESS ARTICLES, PUBLISHED 
IN THE WEEKLY \"GLOBUS,\" HND VICE PRESIDENT JOSIP MANOLIC 
WROTE THAT Z-4 IS THE \"MOST SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENT 
OFFERING A SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS IN CROATIA.\"  HE WAS 
CRITICAL OF THE GOC FOR NOT PROPOSING THEIR OWN PLAN, 
WHICH WAS EMPHASIZED BY MESIC WHEN HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR 
THAT THE GOC SHOULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO FILL THE VOID 
WHEN THEY CANCELLED THE UNPROFOR MANDATE.  MANOLIC 
CRITICIZED THE VIEW THAT Z-4 WOULD CREATE A STATE WITHIN A 
STATE, WRITING THAT, IN HIS OPINION, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 
GIVES THE SERBS THE RIGHT TO HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE AND COURT 
AUTHORITY AS WELL AS PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS TO PASS 
LEGISLATION ON ISSUES OF LOCAL AUTONOMY.

ISTRIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (IDS)

BUT IS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE Z-4 PLAN\'S GRANTING LOCAL 
AUTONOMY ONLY TO SERBS.  ON FEBRUARY 14 POLOFF VISITED THE

TAGS:  PGOV PREL HR SR BK 
SUBJECT:  POLITICAL PARTY KALEIDOSCOPE:  SOME OPPOSITION 
          PARTIES\' SUPPORT Z-4, AUTONOMY 
 
MAYOR ALDO SKIRA, AND PARTY SECRETARY EMIL SOLDATIC.  THE 
MAIN ISSUE ON THE AGENDA WAS THE RECENT RULING AGAINST 
REGIONAL AUTONOMY BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WHICH STRUCK 
DOWN 19 PROVISIONS OF THE ISTRIAN COUNTY STATUTE 
PERTAINING TO OFFICIAL USE OF THE ITALIAN LANGUAGE AND 
DECENTRALIZATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATION. 
 
7.  SOLDATIC SAID THAT THE IDS\'S OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE 
COURT\'S DECISION ARE LIMITED.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT\'S 
RULING WAS FINAL AND THERE WAS NO AVENUE FOR PURSUING AN 
APPEAL.  IDS, HOWEVER, WILL CONTINUE TO LOBBY THE SABOR 
FOR CHANGES IN THE CONSTITUTION.  BEYOND THAT THE IDS WILL 
TRY TO REFORMULATE SOME STATUTES INTO SOMETHING ACCEPTABLE 
TO THE GOC AND CONTINUE TO TEST THE LAW TO SEE HOW MUCH 
AUTONOMY ZAGREB WILL ALLOW.  THEY ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT NOT 
ONLY COULD THE DECISION PROVIDE MOTIVATION TO ANTI-CROAT 
EXTREMISTS IN BOTH ITALY AND ISTRIA TO PURSUE MORE VOCAL 
CAMPAIGNS FOR SEPARATISM AND BORDER CHANGES, BUT IT ALSO 
DID NOT BODE WELL FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF GOC CONCESSIONS 
TO KNIN. 
 
8.  ALONG WITH THE SNS, IDS UNANIMOUSLY OPPOSED 
TERMINATION OF THE UNPROFOR MANDATE.  IN PRIVATE JAKOVCIC 
SAID THAT THE GOC DECISION ON UNPROFOR AND THE \"RSK\'S\" 
REFUSAL TO EVEN LOOK AT THE Z-4 PLAN MADE HIM, FOR THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

FIRST TIME, \"REALLY SCARED FOR THE FUTURE.\"  BOTH SIDES 
HAD TAKEN EXTREME POSITIONS WHICH WERE NOT EASY TO BACK 
DOWN FROM, AND THE GOC WAS NOT FACING UP TO THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD LOSE A WAR WITH THE \"RSK,\" 
ESPECIALLY WITH BSA AND FRY SUPPORT.  HE SAID HE HAD 
CONSIDERED THE IDEA OF OFFERING TO LEAD A GROUP OF 
OPPOSITION LEADERS TO KNIN IN AN EFFORT TO RESTART 
NEGOTIATIONS, BUT ADMITTED THAT THE IDEA HAD PROBLEMS (FOR 
INSTANCE, WHAT WOULD THEY DO IF GREETED WITH THE \"RSK\" 
FLAG AND ANTHEM).  ALSO, OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES PROBABLY 
WOULD NOT SUPPORT SUCH A MOVE BECAUSE MANY ARE SUPPORTING 
THE GOC POSITION. 
 
----------------------------- 
CROATIAN PEASANTS PARTY (HSS) 
----------------------------- 
 
9.  THE HSS TYPIFIES THE STANCE ASSUMED BY MOST OF THE 
REST OF THE OPPOSITION.  NEW HSS PRESIDENT ZLATKO TOMCIC, 
IN A CALL ON THE AMBASSADOR NOVEMBER 8, SAID THAT THE HSS 
SUPPORTED THE GOC DECISION TO TERMINATE THE UNPROFOR 
MANDATE, BUT THEY WOULD SUPPORT A REVISION OF THE MANDATE 
(UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME) IF IT PROVIDED GUARANTEES TO 
CONTROL CROATIA\'S BORDERS.  TOMCIC SAID THAT IN GENERAL 
THE HSS SUPPORTS THE Z-4 PLAN AS A BASIS FOR DISCUSSION 
BUT HAD SERIOUS RESERVATIONS, PARTICULARLY ON THE ISSUE OF 
TIES TO SERBIA.  TOMCIC CLAIMED THE HSS WAS IN FAVOR OF 
ADMINISTRATIVE AUTONOMY FOR THE SERBS, BUT WHEN ASKED BY 
THE AMBASSADOR IF THIS MEANT THAT SERBS COULD PURCHASE, 
FOR EXAMPLE, SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS FROM SERBIA, TOMCIC 
ANSWERED, \"ABSOLUTELY NOT.\"  A FLUSTERED SILENCE ENSUED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

COMMENT 
------- 
 
10.  THE ATTITUDE OF THE HND AND IDS (AND SNS) -- THIRD, 
AND, ROUGHLY, SIXTH LARGEST PARTIES IN THE SABOR -- IS A 
SMALL HOPEFUL SIGN THAT ATTITUDES AMONG THE OPPOSITION\'S 
CONSTITUENCIES HAVE NOT SOLIDIFIED AGAINST SERB AUTONOMY 
AND THE Z-4.  THERE ARE AT LEAST A FEW VOICES CHALLENGING 
TUDJMAN\'S RATHER UNREALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF WHAT UNPROFOR\'S 
DEPARTURE WILL MEAN FOR CROATIA.

          \"ESPIONAGE\" FACE POSSIBLE DEATH SENTENCE 
 
1.  THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 7. 
 
2.  (U) IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS, OVER TEN OF THE MOST 
PROMINENT MUSLIM COMMUNITY LEADERS IN THE BANJA LUKA 
REGION HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AT THEIR MERHAMET OFFICES AND IN 
THEIR HOMES BY SERB MILITARY AUTHORITIES.  THE DETAINED 
INCLUDED NIJAZ KARASELIMOVIC, THE 73-YEAR-OLD PRESIDENT OF 
MERHAMET BANJA LUKA.  POLICE ALSO CARRIED AWAY COMPUTERS 
AND DISKS CONTAINING THE ORGANIZATION\'S RECORDS.  THERE 
ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF SIMILAR ARRESTS IN NOVI GRAD 
(FORMERLY BOSANSKI NOVI) AND PRNJAVOR.  AFTER THESE 
ARRESTS AND THOSE OF THE SDA LEADERSHIP FIVE MONTHS AGO, 
THE ONLY REMAINING MUSLIM COMMUNITY LEADER IN BANJA LUKA 
IS THE RELIGIOUS MUFTI, IBRAHIM HALILOVIC. 
 
3.  (LOU) ACCORDING TO AP/HINA, MERHAMET ZAGREB SOURCES, 
AND KARASELIMOVIC\'S SON EMIR (PROTECT), THESE PRISONERS 
ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DETENTION IN A MILITARY PRISON, HAVE 
BEEN INDICTED BY THE MILITARY PROSECUTOR IN BANJA LUKA FOR

ESPIONAGE, AND MAY BE SUMMARILY EXECUTED IF CONVICTED. 
EFFORTS BY INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES TO VISIT THE PRISONERS 
HAVE BEEN REBUFFED SO FAR.  LOCAL SOURCES IN CONTACT WITH 
THEIR FAMILIES TOLD US THAT, IN PRISON, THE MUSLIMS WERE 
BEATEN AND TORTURED BY THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES.  THE 
INDICTMENT ALLEGES THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS CARRIED OUT 
ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES IN THE FORM OF CONTACTS WITH FOREIGN 
EMBASSIES IN ZAGREB, AND REPORTEDLY NAMED THE BOSNIAN 
EMBASSY.  PREVIOUS TO HIS ARREST, EMBOFF HAD MET WITH 
KARASELIMOVIC IN ZAGREB ON FEBRUARY 21 TO DISCUSS THE 
WORSENING HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION FOR MINORITIES IN THE 
BANJA LUKA REGION.  AN ACCOUNT FROM BANJA LUKA\'S \"GLAS 
SRPSKI\" LINKED THESE ALLEGED ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES WITH 
THOSE OF THE SDA LEADERSHIP \"VALTER GROUP,\" SIMILARLY 
CHARGED, AND CURRENTLY ON TRIAL BY THE MILITARY 
PROSECUTOR. 
 
4.  (U) THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS ARE REPORTED TO BE 
IMPRISONED AT THE MALI LOGOR BARRACKS IN BANJA LUKA AT 
THIS TIME:

MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN BANJA LUKA.  FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ARE REPORTEDLY PREPARED TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY IN FEAR FOR 
THEIR LIVES.

2. FONMIN GRANIC DETAILED THE SUCCESS OF THE CROATIAN 
FORCES TO THE DIP CORPS ON MAY 3.  HE ANNOUNCED A 
\"CEASEFIRE\" HAD BEEN AGREED WITH THE SERBS, WHICH HE HOPED 
WOULD END THE ATTACKS ON ZAGREB.  (NOTE: OUR FOLLOW UP 
CONTACTS WITH THE UN INDICATE THAT GRANIC MAY HAVE SPOKEN 
TOO SOON IN ANNOUNCING A CEASEFIRE, IT APPEARS TO BE ONLY 
AN AGREEMENT FOR THE EVACUATION OF SERBS FROM A POCKET IN 
THE NORTH OF THE SECTOR.)  THE GOC HAD DECIDED NOT TO 
RETALIATE FOR THE MISSILE ATTACKS OF MAY 2 AND 3, BUT 
FURTHER ATTACKS WOULD REQUIRE A RESPONSE.  PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN HAD DECIDED THAT SECTOR WEST WOULD BECOME AN 
EXAMPLE OF HOW TERRITORY COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY 
REINTEGRATED AND THAT COEXISTENCE OF SERB AND CROAT WAS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

POSSIBLE, WITH FULL CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ALL CROATIAN SERBS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3. FOREIGN MINISTER GRANIC MET WITH THE ENTIRE ZAGREB 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON MAY 3 AT 1600.  HE SAID THAT THE GOC 
HAD ACHIEVED ITS OBJECTIVES IN SECTOR WEST, WHICH WERE: 1) 
TO REOPEN THE HIGHWAY UNDER CONDITIONS PERMITTING ITS SAFE 
OPERATION, AND 2) SEVER THE ROUTE BY WHICH THE BOSNIAN 
SERBS COULD OFFER SUPPORT TO THE \"RSK.\"  THE BOSNIAN SERBS 
HAD ATTEMPTED \"UNSUCCESSFULLY\" TO OFFER SUPPORT TO THE 
KRAJINA SERBS ON TWO OCCASIONS (NFI). 
 
4.  GRANIC STRESSED THAT THE CROATIANS HAD ACTED TO AVOID 
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES; THE TOWN OF OKUCANI WAS ISOLATED, BUT 
IN A WAY WHICH PERMITTED THOSE IN THE POPULATION WHO 
WANTED TO LEAVE A WAY OUT.  THE SERBS WERE CLAIMING THAT 
5000 CIVILIANS HAD FLED THE SECTOR DURING THE ATTACK; THE 
GOC BELIEVED THE NUMBER TO BE CLOSER TO UNHCR\'S ESTIMATE 
OF 2500 PEOPLE.  THE ONLY PIECE OF TERRITORY WHICH THE GOC 
DID NOT YET CONTROL WAS A POCKET OF TERRITORY NORTH OF THE 
HIGHWAY, BETWEEN OKUCANI AND PAKRAC.  THE SERBS SAID IT 
CONTAINED 600 SOLDIERS AND 3000 CIVILIANS, BUT THE GOC 
COULD NOT CONFIRM THOSE NUMBERS.  AN AGREEMENT HAD BEEN 
REACHED BY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER KOSTOVIC ON MAY 2 THAT 
THOSE AMONG THAT GROUP WHO WISHED TO LEAVE FOR BOSNIAN 
SERB HELD TERRITORY COULD DO SO UNDER UN AUSPICES.  THE 
GOC HAD PROMISED TO ALL WHO CHOOSE TO STAY THAT THEY WOULD 
HAVE FULL CIVIL RIGHTS AND THEIR WOULD BE A COMPLETE 
AMNESTY FOR ALL WHO TURNED IN THEIR ARMS, EXCEPT FOR THOSE 
GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES.

5. SHORTLY INTO THE MEETING, GRANIC WAS CALLED AWAY FOR A 
PHONE CALL WITH GOC PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF HRVOJE 
SARINIC.  GRANIC RETURNED TO REPORT THAT SARINIC HAD 
REACHED A \"CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES\" WITH THE KRAJINA 
SERBS, WITH THE MEDIATION OF UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE 
AKASHI.  HE THEN PASSED AROUND A COPY OF THE FOUR- 
PARAGRAPH AGREEMENT (COPY FAXED TO EUR/SCE).  THE 
AGREEMENT STATED THAT \"THERE WILL BE A TOTAL CESSATION OF 
HOSTILITIES IN SECTOR WEST (WESTERN SLAVONIA) AND 
ELSEWHERE FROM 1700 HOURS 3 MAY 1995\" AND SAID ALL WHO 
WISH TO LEAVE SECTOR WEST COULD DO SO UNDER UN 
\"SURVEILLANCE.\"  GRANIC SAID THAT SARINIC HAD AGREED

          CEASEFIRE; SAYS GOC WON\'T RETALIATE FOR MAY 3 
          MISSILE ATTACKS EITHER 
 
GOC HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH BELGRADE ON MAY 3 \"AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVELS\" BOTH DIRECTLY AND VIA THE UN.  THE GOC 
BELIEVED THAT BELGRADE HAD WEIGHED IN WITH KNIN IN FAVOR 
OF THE CEASEFIRE. 
 
6. GRANIC EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THE CESSATION OF 
HOSTILITIES AGREEMENT WOULD MEAN THE END TO THE ROCKET 
ATTACKS ON ZAGREB, ALTHOUGH HE NOTED THAT THERE WERE \"NO 
GUARANTEES.\" 
 
7. COMMENT:  WHEN WE CHECKED WITH THE UN CIVIL AFFAIRS 
COORDINATOR IN KNIN, WE WERE TOLD THE CESSATION OF 
HOSTILITIES AGREEMENT HAD BEEN NEGOTIATED ON THE SERB SIDE 
BY \"PRIME MINISTER\" MIKELIC; MARTIC\'S CHIEF OF STAFF, 
ILIJA PRIJIC; AND MILITARY \"CHIEF OF STAFF\" LONCAR.  THE 
WITHDRAWAL OF THE SERBS FROM THE PAKRAC POCKET WAS 
SCHEDULED TO OCCUR AT 0900 HOURS LOCAL ON MAY 4. MIKELIC, 
PRIJIC AND LONCAR HAD ALSO SIGNED A TEXT OF A CEASEFIRE 
AGREEMENT WHICH HAD FOUR ESSENTIAL POINTS:  1) BOTH SIDES 
WOULD \"WITHDRAW\" TO THE LINES AS BEFORE MAY 1; 20 THE UN 
ALONE WOULD CONTROL THE HIGHWAY UNDER A SPECIAL REGIME; 3) 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

BOTH SIDES WOULD RESPECT THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND

HELD.  GRANIC MADE NO MENTION OF ANY CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT

NO CROATIAN RETALIATION FOR MISSILE ATTACKS ON ZAGREB 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
8. GRANIC SAID THAT THE GOC HAD MADE THE DECISION, DESPITE 
\"LOTS OF PUBLIC PRESSURE,\" NOT TO RESPOND TO THE MISSILE 
ATTACKS OF MAY 2 OR MAY 3.  GRANIC GAVE DETAILS, AS 
CURRENTLY KNOWN, ON THE ATTACKS.  ON MAY 2, SIX ROCKETS 
WERE FIRED AT ZAGREB, RESULTING IN SIX DEATHS AND 143 
INJURED (ONE OF THE INJURED WAS LIKELY TO DIE).  ON MAY 3, 
THERE WERE NINE ROCKETS (SIX IN THE CITY CENTER AND THREE 
IN THE WIDER AREA).  ONE POLICEMAN HAD DIED WHILE 
DISARMING AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AND TWO CIVILIANS WHO WERE 
INJURED IN THE ATTACKS WERE EXPECTED TO DIE FROM THEIR 
WOUNDS.  41 OTHER WERE CONFIRMED AS INJURED, AMONG THE 
SERIOUSLY INJURED WAS THE TWENTY-ONE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER OF 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER KOSTOVIC (GRANIC NOTED HIS OWN 
DAUGHTER HAD BEEN AT THE HIGH SCHOOL HIT IN YESTERDAY\'S 
ATTACK).  GRANIC STRESSED THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN EASY FOR 
THE GOC TO SHOW RESTRAINT IN RESPONDING TO THE MISSILE 
ATTACKS.  IN THIS REGARD, GRANIC NOTED THAT CROATIA\'S 
CONTINUED NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EU HAD BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR 
IN REENFORCING CROATIA\'S RESTRAINT.

9. IF THERE WERE FURTHER MISSILE ATTACKS, HOWEVER, GRANIC 
SAID THE GOC WOULD HAVE TO TAKE ACTION \"TO PROTECT 
OURSELVES FROM THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF ATTACK.\"  BUT HE 
STRESSED THAT THE GOC WOULD IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES TARGET 
CIVILIANS IN ANY ATTACK.  GRANIC ALSO SAID THAT THE GOC 
WOULD BE SUPPLYING THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL WITH INFORMATION 
SHOWING THAT THE CLUSTER BOMB ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN TARGETS 
HAD BEEN ORDERED BY \"RSK PRESIDENT\" MARTIC AND AGREED TO 
BY \"RSK\" COMMANDER CELEKETIC.  \"RSK CHIEF OF STAFF\" LONCAR 
WAS ALSO IMPLICATED.  HE INDICATED THAT CROATIAN COURTS 
WOULD ALSO PURSUE CHARGES AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.   ON MAY 8, EMBOFF VISITED THE SECTOR WEST TOWNS OF 
JASENOVAC, OKUCANI, PAKRAC, AND A DETENTION CENTER IN 
BJELOVAR WITH A GROUP OF ZAGREB BASED DIPLOMATS ORGANIZED 
BY THE MFA.  THE CONDITION OF THESE TOWNS IS AS DESCRIBED 
IN OTHER REPORTING OF PREVIOUS EMBASSY TRIPS.  THE SERBS 
WE SPOKE WITH WERE CLEARLY DISTRESSED BY THE DILEMMA THEY 
NOW FACE; WHETHER TO STAY IN CROATIA WHERE THEY FACE 
POTENTIALLY BLEAK ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND LIKELY 
DISCRIMINATION, OR OPT FOR THE EVEN BLEAKER PROSPECTS AND 
CONTINUING CONFLICT WHICH AWAIT THEM IN BOSNIA OR THE 
REMAINING AREAS OF SERB-CONTROLLED CROATIA.  END SUMMARY.

2.  THE CROATIAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARRANGED A 
VISIT TO SECTOR WEST FOR THE ZAGREB DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON 
MONDAY, MAY 8, LED BY FOREIGN MINISTER MATE GRANIC.  A 
MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON EXPLAINED THAT THE POPULATION IN THE 
SERB-HELD PORTION OF SECTOR WEST WAS ROUGHLY 43,000 PEOPLE 
BEFORE THE 1991 WAR.  OF THIS FIGURE, AROUT 25,000 WERE 
SERBS, 16,000 CROATS, AND 2,000 \"YUGOSLAVS.\"  THE CROATS 
HAD ALL FLED (14,000 ARE CURRENTLY REGISTERED IN ZAGREB). 
OF THE SERB POPULATION, THE SPOKESPERSON CLAIMED THAT 
15,000 STILL REMAINED IN THE SECTOR, WHILE 7,000 HAVE FLED 
IN THE RECENT FIGHTING.  (COMMENT: THE DIFFERENCE IS 
PROBABLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY PEOPLE WHO EMIGRATED TO BOSNIA 
OR SERBIA DURING THE INTERVENING THREE YEARS.) 
 
------------------------------------- 
JASENOVAC PRESERVED; OKUCANI DESERTED 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  THE VISIT BEGAN IN JASENOVAC, THE SITE OF THE WWII 
CONCENTRATION CAMP.  THE MONUMENT TO THOSE WHO HAD 
PERISHED THERE OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO (MOSTLY SERBS) 
REMAINED UNTOUCHED, AS DID THE SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. 
THE NEARBY CATHOLIC CHURCH, IN STARK CONTRAST, WAS BADLY 
DAMAGED ALTHOUGH THE VAULTED ROOF REMAINED INTACT AND WE 
WERE TOLD MASS WOULD BE CELEBRATED THERE THE FOLLOWING 
DAY. 
 
4.  IN OKUCANI, THE MAJOR POPULATION CENTER IN THE SERB- 
HELD PART OF THE SECTOR, THERE WERE SIGNS OF RECENT DAMAGE 
TO THE HOUSING AND OTHER STRUCTURES IN THE CITY.   MOST OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01795  01 OF 03  091745Z 
THE HOUSES APPEARED DESERTED EXCEPT FOR STRAY CHICKENS AND 
PIGS.  THE GROUP VISITED THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, WHICH WAS 
INTACT EXCEPT FOR SOME BROKEN WINDOWS.  SILVER FRAMED 
ICONS, BIBLES AND OTHER VALUABLE RELIGIOUS ARTICLES WERE 
UNDISTURBED.  IT APPEARED THAT THE PRIEST MIGHT HAVE FLED 
WITHOUT TIME ENOUGH TO GO TO THE CHURCH AND COLLECT THOSE 
THINGS MOST PRECIOUS TO HIM. 
 
5.  A NUMBER OF CROATIAN OFFICIALS MET US IN THE TOWN 
CENTER.  WE WERE TOLD THAT, OF A POPULATION OF 2,000 SERBS 
BEFORE THE CROATIAN ACTION, ONLY A FEW HUNDRED REMAINED. 
NUMEROUS GROUPS OF MUNICIPAL WORKERS IN BLUE COATS FROM 
NEARBY TOWNS WERE ON THE SCENE TO HELP IN THE CLEAN-UP 
EFFORT.  ZAGREBACKA BANKA HAD OPENED A BRANCH OFFICE IN 
THE CENTER OF THE TOWN.  SIGNS HAD ALREADY BEEN POSTED AT 
THE TOWN HALL FOR A NUMBER OF CROATIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICES 
INCLUDING THE OFFICE FOR PENSIONS AND SOCIAL WELFARE AND 
THE OFFICE FOR TAX COLLECTION. 
 
6.  THERE WERE SIGNS OF POSSIBLE LOOTING.  PILES OF 
CLOTHING COULD BE SEEN OUTSIDE SOME HOUSES, SUGGESTING 
EITHER THAT LOOTING HAD TAKEN PLACE OR THAT OCCUPANTS HAD

LOADED WITH AN ASSORTMENT OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE MOSTLY 
PERISHABLE ITEMS. AS THE BUS DROVE BY A SMALL GROCERY 
STORE, WE SAW CROATIAN MILITIA TAKING BOXES OUT AND 
PUTTING THEM IN A PICKUP.  THERE WERE NO CLEAR SIGNS, 
HOWEVER, THAT LOOTING HAD BEEN SYSTEMATIC OR ON A WIDE 
SCALE.

UNCERTAINTY REIGNS IN PAKRAC

7.  THE FORMERLY SERB-CONTROLLED SIDE OF PAKRAC TOWNSHIP, 
UNLIKE OKUCANI, IS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE 
BOSNIAN BORDER, AND PEOPLE HAD LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO FLEE.

ROUGHLY 3,000 REMAINED IN AND AROUND THE TOWN.  DAMAGE WAS 
LIGHT.  THE SERB MILITIA TRAPPED IN THIS AREA SURRENDERED 
WITHOUT MUCH OF A FIGHT, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE REPORTS OF 
ARMED SERBS STILL HOLED UP IN THE SURROUNDING HILLS. 
 
--------------------- 
SOME INDIVIDUAL CASES 
--------------------- 
 
8.  WE WERE ABLE TO SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH THE (MOSTLY 
FEMALE) SERBS WE ENCOUNTERED.  NO ONE REPORTED ANY LOOTING 
OR MISTREATMENT.  THEY WERE CONCERNED FOR THEIR MEN, WHO 
HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY TO NEARBY BJELOVAR.  THERE WAS ALSO 
OBVIOUS CONCERN OVER WHAT THE FUTURE HELD IN STORE FOR 
THEM.  THE GOC HAD OPENED AN OFFICE THAT DAY TO REGISTER 
THOSE WISHING TO APPLY FOR CROATIAN CITIZENSHIP AND 
CLAIMED THAT 100 HAD ALREADY DONE SO.  NEVERTHELESS, NO 
ONE EMBOFF SPOKE TO HAD MADE A DECISION TO TAKE THAT STEP. 
- 
9.  MANY HAD FLED TO THE AREA FROM THE CROATIAN CONTROLLED 
PART OF THE SECTOR DURING THE 1991 WAR.  AN ELDERLY WOMAN 
FROM PAKRAC SAID THAT ALTHOUGH SHE HAD BEEN OFFERED THE 
CHANCE TO RETURN NOW, SHE HAD NO INTENTION OF DOING SO 
SINCE HER HOUSE HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND SHE HAD NOWHERE TO 
LIVE.  SHE INDICATED SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO BOSNIA IF 
GIVEN THE CHANCE. 
 
10.  A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD FLED TO THE AREA FROM DARUVAR IN 
1991 HAD BEEN ROUNDED UP WHEN THE CROATIAN FORCES ARRIVED 
AND SENT TO BJELOVAR.  HE HAD BEEN RELEASED THE NIGHT 
BEFORE AS PART OF A GROUP OF 49 THAT HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

RETURN.  ALTHOUGH HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITION OF 
HIS HOME IN DARUVAR HE SAID HE HAD NO INTENTION OF 
RETURNING THERE, WHERE HE FELT HE WOULD HAVE NO JOB 
PROSPECTS AND VERY POSSIBLY FACE THE ILL WILL OF HIS 
FORMER CROATIAN NEIGHBORS. 
 
11.  ANOTHER YOUNG MAN OF MILITARY AGE HAD ALSO RECENTLY 
BEEN RELEASED FROM THE DETENTION CENTER IN NEARBY 
BJELOVAR.  HE WAS ORIGINALLY FROM PAKRAC.  HIS MOTHER HAD 
LEFT FOR BOSNIA THREE YEARS EARLIER.  HE CANDIDLY 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD BEEN ON ACTIVE MILITARY DUTY FOR 
THE \"RSK\" MILITIA SINCE THAT TIME.  HIS RECORD WAS 
APPARENTLY NO IMPEDIMENT TO HIS RELEASE.

\"PLEASE RELEASE ME\"

12.  THE DETEMTION CENTER IN BJELOVAR IS LOCATED IN A 
SPORTS HALL.  WE WERE TOLD THAT, TO DATE, THE CROATS HAD 
DETAINED 1,475 SERBS IN VARIOUS SITES, OF WHOM 554 HAD 
BEEN RELEASED, 105 WERE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR WAR

TO GIVE FOREIGN MISSIONS A FIRST-HAND LOOK AT THE AREA 
WILL DOUBTLESS PAY DIVIDENDS -- AS IT IS INTENDED TO -- IN 
THE FORM OF REPORTS THAT WILL SERVE TO REASSURE MANY KEY 
GOVERNMENTS THAT EARLY UN REPORTS OF ATROCITIES WERE

SUMMARY

2.  ON MAY 8 AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH LED A GROUP THROUGH 
FORMER SECTOR WEST TO NOVSKA, JASENOVAC, OKUCANI, NOVA 
GRADISKA, AND PAKRAC.  AT THE MONUMENT IN JASENOVAC 
COMMEMORATING THOSE WHO DIED IN THE INFAMOUS 
CONCENTRATION CAMP THERE, THE AMBASSADOR LAID A WREATH. 
THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH LOCAL SERB LEADERS IN PAKRAC WHO 
SAID THAT THE MAIN ISSUE NOW IS HOW TO OBTAIN GUARANTEES 
OF THE LEGAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE SERB POPULATION OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

WESTERN SLAVONIA, SO THAT REMAINING SERBS CAN BE 
CONVINCED TO STAY.  THE AMBASSADOR\'S PARTY ALSO VISITED A 
GYMNASIUM IN NOVA GRADISKA WHERE ABOUT 150-200 MOSTLY 
ELDERLY (AND PRESUMABLY SERB) DETAINEES FROM THE OKUCANI 
AREA ARE STILL BEING HELD ON SECURITY GROUNDS.  AT THE 
SAME TIME, PREVIOUSLY DISPLACED CROATS ARE APPARENTLY 
ALREADY RETURNING TO THE TOWN.  SOME SHOPS IN OKUCANI 
APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN LOOTED SINCE THE MAY 5 VISIT BY 
POLOFF AND DATT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ON MAY 8 AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH, POLOFFS, DAO, PAO, AND 
APPROXIMATELY 30 MEMBERS OF THE ZAGREB PRESS CORPS DROVE 
THROUGH FORMER SECTOR WEST, TO NOVSKA, JASENOVAC, 
OKUCANI, NOVA GRADISKA AND PAKRAC.  THE FOCUS OF THE TRIP 
WAS PEACEFUL REINTEGRATION, SPECIFICALLY, GOC TREATMENT 
OF THE SERB POPULATION AND MILITARY PRISONERS.  IT BEGAN 
WITH A TOUR OF JASENOVAC, A NOW NEARLY DESERTED TOWN 
WHICH WAS THE LOCATION OF THE INFAMOUS CONCENTRATION CAMP 
RUN BY THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA DURING WORLD WAR 
II.  THE AMBASSADOR LAID A WREATH, ACCOMPANIED RY 
PROMINENT CROATIAN SERB MILORAD PUPOVAC (WHO HAD COME AT 
THE AMBASSADOR\'S INVITATION).

4.  THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH VELJKO DJAKULA AND OBRAD 
IVANOVIC, LOCAL SERB LEADERS IN PAKRAC WHO HAD BEEN 
ARRESTED BY THE CROATS LAST WEEK AND THEN RELEASED. 
(NOTE: DJAKULA, A SERB MODERATE, WAS ONE OF THE SIGNERS

OF THE DARUVAR AGREEMENT IN 1993 WHICH, HAD IT NOT BEEN 
LOCKED BY KNIN AND BELGRADE, WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT 
MODEST ECONOMIC COOPERATION RETWEEN ZAGREB AND THE SECTOR 
WEST SERBS.  IVANOVIC WAS THE MAYOR OF SERB-OCCUPIED 
PAKRAC.  DJAKULA SAID HIS MAIN OBJECTIVE AT PRESENT WAS 
TO OBTAIN GUARANTEES OF THE LEGAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE 
SERB POPULATION OF WESTERN SLAVONIA.  HE SAID THAT SERBS 
ARE READY TO PEACEFULLY REINTEGRATE INTO CROATIA IF THE 
GOC SHOWS THAT IT IS READY TO CARRY OUT THIS GOAL 
PEACEFULLY.  ON THAT POINT, DJAKULA WAS DOUBTFUL, GIVEN 
EXPERIENCES SO FAR. 
 
5.  DJAKULA DESCRIBED EVENTS DURING THE HV OFFENSIVE AND 
ACCUSED THE ARMY OF BREAKING PRIOR AGREEMENTS TO AVOID 
HOSTILITIES.  HE SAID THAT, AFTER ARTILLERY FIRE BEGAN 
EARLY MAY 1, SERBS IN PAKRAC TOOK WEAPONS FROM THE 
COLLECTION SITES, BUT WERE ORDERED NOT TO RETURN FIRE. 
THEY REQUESTED A CEASEFIRE WITH THE HV THROUGH THE UN AND 
LATER THAT MORNING AGREED TO TURN OVER THEIR SMALL ARMS 
WITHIN 24 HOURS AND REMAINING HEAVY WEAPONS IN 4 DAYS. 
REPEATED REQUESTS FOR MEETINGS TO FINALIZE THE WRITTEN 
GUARANTEES, HOWEVER, WERE DELAYED RY THE CROATS UNTIL 
AROUND 1400 HOURS WHEN ARTILLERY FIRE ERUPTED FROM ALL 
SIDES.  THE SERBS HAD NO CHOICE RUT TO SURRENDER.  THE HV

ARRESTED \"ARSK\" TROOPS AND TOOK THEM TO HOLDING AREAS. 
 
6.  SERB LEADERS DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY OF THEIR FIGHTERS 
WERE TAKEN AND WHERE, OR HOW MANY WERE CASUALTIES. 
ALLEGATIONS OF MASSACRES WERE GETTING WIDE PLAY AMONG THE 
SERB POPULATION, ACCORDING TO DJAKULA.  IN MANY CASES, 
SERB FAMILIES DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO FAMILY 
MEMBERS WHO HAD BEEN ROUNDED UP RY CROATIAN FORCES. 
DJAKULA CLAIMED GUNFIRE IN THE PAKRAC AREA CONTINUED 
SPORADICALLY.  SERBS WERE SCARED THAT THOSE WHO 
SURRENDERED WERE BEING SHOT BY CROAT SOLDIERS EXACTING 
REVENGE.

7.  DJAKULA CLAIMED TO HAVE HEARD THAT THE UN WAS 
INVESTIGATING WAR CRIMES IN THE AREA.  HE ALSO REPORTED 
ONE INCIDENT HE HAD HEARD ABOUT IN WHICH A TRUCK SEEKING 
TO FLEE AT NIGHT FROM ADVANCING CROATIAN FORCES HAD BEEN 
FIRED UPON AND 7 OF ITS EIGHT OCCUPANTS KILLED.  THE 
AMBASSADOR IN TURN INFORMED HIM OF THE INCIDENT NEAR THE 
SAVA RIVER BRIDGE WHERE A GROUP OF CIVILIANS HAD BEEN 
KILLED UNDER AS YET TO BE EXPLAINED CIRCUMSTANCES. 
DJAKULA HAD APPARENTLY NOT YET HEARD OF THE INCIDENT.  HE 
CITED A SEPARATE CASE WHERE A SMALL NUMBER OF CIVILIANS 
WERE KILLED BY AN HV PATROL. 
 
8.  THE AMBASSADOR ASSURED DJAKULA THE USG WOULD DO ITS 
BEST TO INVESTIGATE BOTH OF THESE INCIDENTS.  THE 
AMBASSADOR AND DJAKULA AGREED THAT UNHCR AND ICRC SHOULD 
BE MONITORING RELEASES.  ADDITIONALLY, DJAKULA STATED 
THAT THERE WERE A FEW PROMINENT LOCAL SERBS IN JAIL IN 
BJELOVAR: MLADEN KULIC, COLONEL HARAMBASIC, SAVO 
RADOSEVIC.  HE SAID HE HAD HEARD THAT KULIC HAD BEEN 
BEATEN.  (NOTE: EMBASSY WILL MAKE A FOLLOWUP VISIT MAY 9 
TO SEE THESE INDIVIDUALS--AS WELL AS OTHER DETAINEES. 
REFCOORD WILL ALSO BE CHECKING WITH UNHCR AND ICRC TO SEE 
WHETHER THEY ARE MONITORING THE STATUS OF RELEASED 
PRISONERS.) 
 
9.  INFLUENTIAL CROATIAN SERB LEADER MILORAD PUPOVAC ALSO 
ATTENDED THE AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH DJAKULA.  PUPOVAC 
SAID THAT A NUMBER OF ISSUES MUST BE ADDRESSED FOR ZAGREB 
TO BUILD CONFIDENCE WITH ITS SERB COMMUNITY. 
 
--DETAINEES, WHETHER CIVILIAN OR MILITARY, MUST BE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES. 
 
--THE HV MUST WITHDRAW AND BE REPLACED BY AN 
INTERNATIONAL FORCE. 
 
--THE DISCUSSION ON HOW TO GUARANTEE SERB RIGHTS MUST BE 
STARTED NOW. 
 
--SERBS MUST BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH CROATIAN 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND WHAT IT OFFERS THEM. 
 
--SERBS IN FORMER SECTOR WEST NEED TO FORGE STRONG TIES 
TO SERBS IN THE REST OF CROATIA. 
 
--THE GOC MUST SHOW THAT IT RESPECTS ITS OWN LAWS AND 
APPLIES THEM FAIRLY TO THE SERB COMMUNITY. 
 
10.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT KIND OF GUARANTEES SERBS 
WOULD NEED TO CONVINCE THEM TO STAY IN CROATIA.  DJAKULA 
SUGGESTED A CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE AND 
EVENTUALLY SOME KIND OF AUTONOMY UNDER A POLITICAL 
SOLUTION.  SERBS IN WESTERN SLAVONIA WOULD CONTINUE TO 
DEPEND ON UNHCR AND ECMM AS GUARANTORS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. 
THE AMBASSADOR TOLD DJAKULA THAT THE U.S. SUPPORTS A

SUBJECT:  CROATIA UPDATE NO. 28: AMRASSADOR\'S TRIP TO 
          FORMER SECTOR WEST, MAY 8 
 
CONTINUED UNCRO PRESENCE IN THE SECTOR ALONGSIDE CIVIL 
CROATIAN AUTHORITIES.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE SECTOR 
SHOULD BE DEMILITARIZED ONCE SECURITY HAD BEEN 
ESTABLISHED.  DATT NOTED THAT THE AMBASSADOR\'S PARTY WAS 
FORCED TO DETOUR BETWEEN NOVSKA AND OKUCANI BECAUSE OF A 
FIREFIGHT AND ASKED IF DJAKULA KNEW OF ANY SERB UNITS 
STILL OPERATING IN THE AREA, BECAUSE THAT WOULD PROVIDE A 
PRETEXT FOR A CONTINUED HV PRESENCE.  DJAKULA KNEW OF NO 
ORGANIZED RESISTANCE AND SUGGESTED THERE WERE STILL 
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE AFRAID TO SURRENDER. 
 
11.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN 
DISPLACED CROATS RETURNED TO CLAIM THEIR LAND AND HOW 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01796  03 OF 04  091827Z 
DJAKULA THOUGHT THE URGE TO TAKE REVENGE COULD BE 
STEMMED.  DJAKULA BELIEVED THAT FEAR AND SELF-INTEREST 
WOULD BALANCE EACH OTHER AND BRING PEACE.  SERBS WHO 
WILLINGLY RETURNED TO THE AREA WOULD NOT COME BACK TO 
MAKE TROUBLE, BUT BY NECESSITY WOULD BE COMMITTED TO 
SOLVING PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES.  HOWEVER, 
DJAKULA SAID HE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO TELL PEOPLE TO 
RETURN OR STAY BECAUSE HE WOULD BE BLAMED IF ANYBODY WAS 
MISTREATED.  HE COULD NOT TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
LEADING THE COMMUNITY INTO THE UNKNOWN BECAUSE EVERY 
WRONG STEP WOULD BE USED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES BY KNIN, 
PALE, AND ZAGREB.  SERBS MUST MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES 
INDIVIDUALLY.  ULTIMATELY, MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY 
WANT TO REMAIN, BUT THE SERBS NEEDED A COOLING OFF 
PERIOD.  WHAT DJAKULA TERMED \"PRESSURE\" BY THE GOC  ON 
PEOPLE TO MAKE A DECISION IMMEDIATELY ON WHETHER THEY 
WERE STAYING OR GOING WAS EXCESSIVE.  (NOTE: ACCORDING TO 
DJAKULA, 95 PERCENT OF THE SERBS IN THE PAKRAC AREA HAVE 
STAYED IN THEIR HOMES.)  ONLY WHEN GUARANTEES THAT HUMAN 
RIGHTS WOULD BE PROTECTED WERE DEMONSTRATED WOULD HE MAKE 
A DECISION ABOUT TAKING HIS OWN CROATIAN CITIZENSHIP 
PAPERS. 
 
---------------------------- 
ELDERLY DETAINEES STILL HELD 
---------------------------- 
 
12.  THE AMBASSADOR\'S PARTY VISITED A GYMNASIUM IN NOVA 
GRADISKA WHICH IS SERVING TO HOLD ABOUT 150-200 MOSTLY 
ELDERLY DETAINEES FROM THE OKUCANI AREA.  UNLIKE THE 
POPULATION OF PAKRAC, PEOPLE IN OKUCANI WERE ROUNDED UP 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

AND TAKEN TO DETENTION CENTERS.  POLOFF TALKED TO A FEW 
OF THE DETAINEES WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN WELL TREATED BY 
POLICE AND RECEIVED GOOD FOOD AND MEDICAL CARE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN YEARS.  WHILE WE WERE AT THE SITE, RELIEF 
WORKERS WERE BRINGING IN FRESH BREAD.  THESE DETAINEES 
WERE, HOWEVER, BORED AND WANTED TO GO HOME; THEY HAD NO 
IDEA WHEN THE POLICE WOULD LET THEM LEAVE.  AT LEAST A 
FEW WERE UNCERTAIN WHETHER THEY WOULD ACCEPT THE GOC 
OFFER TO REMAIN IN CROATIA OR LEAVE FOR BOSNIAN SERB 
TERRITORY.  IN CONTRAST TO THE ELDERLY SERBS STILL BEING 
DETAINED, FORMERLY DISPLACED CROATS REPORTEDLY ARE 
ALREADY BEING RETURNED TO OKUCANI TO REPAIR AND REOPEN 
BUSINESSES.

LOOTING IN OKUCANI 
------------------ 
 
13.  WHEN POLOFF AND DATT VISITED OKUCANI ON MAY 5, THEY 
NOTED SOME INSTANCES OF LOOTING.  BY MAY 8, HOWEVER, 
SHOPS THAT EARLIER HAD BEEN LARGELY UNTOUCHED APPEARED TO 
HAVE BEEN LOOTED.  THEY HAD HAD THEIR WINDOWS BROKEN OUT 
IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH SHELLFIRE, SHELVES WERE 
STRIPPED, AND PACKAGING MATERIAL LITTERED THE FLOORS.

14.  THIS VISIT BROUGHT TO LIGHT SOME INDICATIONS THAT 
THE EARLY CROATIAN SENSITIVITY IN HANDLING DETAINEES MAY

THEIR HOMES AFTER BEING HELD ALMOST A WEEK IS 
INEXCUSABLE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT CROATS ARE 
RETURNING FROM OUTSIDE THE SECTOR TO OPEN BUSINESSES. 
MOREOVER, THE FRESH LOOTING IN OKUCANI, IN AN ENVIRONMENT 
WHERE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RESIDENT CIVILIAN POPULATION 
REMAINING, SUGGESTS AT THE VERY LEAST A DEGREE OF 
LAXNESS, PERHAPS EVEN ACQUIESCENCE, ON THE PART OF SOME 
CIVIL AND MILITARY POLICE.

------------------------------------- 
 
3.  POLOFFS AND DART VISITED SERB DETAINEES AT THE SPORTS 
CENTER IN BJELOVAR.  AT THE TIME OP OUR VISIT, THE 
PRISONERS WERE TAKING A BREAK OUTSIDE.  THE MILITARY 
POLICE OFFICIAL, MATO SICAJA, IN CHARGE OP THE CENTER 
REFUSED TO ANSWER MOST OP OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW 
PRISONERS WERE LOCATED THERE AND HOW MANY HAD BEEN 
RELEASED, CITING THE POTENTIAL FOR POLITICIZATION OF THE 
NUMBERS.  AN ARGENTINE UNMO ON THE SCENE GUESSED THERE 
WERE ABOUT 470 PRISONERS PRESENT.  AT THE END OF THE BREAK 
PERIOD PRISONERS WERE LINED UP TO RETURN TO THE SPORTS 
HALL AND EMBOFFS COUNTED APPROXIMATELY 450-500 PEOPLE. 
 
4.  ALL THE DETAINEES WE TALKED WITH WERE PROM THE PAKRAC 
AREA.  THEY SAID WHAT WE HAVE HEARD PROM PREVIOUS CONTACTS 
-- THAT THEY WERE WELL TREATED AND HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH 
THE GUARDS.  ONE OP THE DETAINEES HAD SUSTAINED RECENT 
INJURIES WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY POLICE, WERE 
SELF INFLICTED (IN THE PRESENCE OP ECMM, SUBJECT 
REPORTEDLY BANGED HIS HEAD WHILE STANDING NEAR A GUARD). 
EACH WAS PROVIDED WITH BLANKETS, BUT SAID THAT SLEEPING 
ROOM WAS CRAMPED.  ONE GROUP OP DETAINEES SAID THAT THE 
ENTIRE GROUP HAD BEEN WOKEN UP THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND TOLD 
TO SIGN SOMETHING, BUT THEY DIDN\'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. 
GUARDS TOLD US THAT THEY WERE RESPONDING TO CONSTANT 
REQUESTS PROM ZAGREB POR PRECISE HEADCOUNTS AT VARIOUS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

TIMES DURING THE DAY AND WOKE THE DETAINEES TO HAVE THEM 
SIGN A SHEET SHOWING THEY WERE PRESENT.  OPFICIALS QUICKLY 
PROVIDED EMBOPPS WITH A COPY OF ONE OP THE PAGES ON WHICH 
WERE HAND PRINTED NAMES, BIRTHDATES, AND SIGNATURES. 
 
5.  WHEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WANTED TO REMAIN IN CROATIA OR 
GO TO BOSNIA OR SERBIA, SOME RESPONDED THAT THEY WANTED TO 
FIND OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEIR FAMILIES BEFORE THEY 
MADE A DECISION (DETAINEES SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN 
TOUCH WITH THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH THE ICRC).  ONE PERSON 
SAID THAT A NUMBER OF THE DETAINEES WOULD LIKE UNHCR TO 
RESETTLE THEM IN THIRD COUNTRIES RATHER THAN RETURN TO 
BOSNIAN SERB TERRITORY.  ONE GROUP THAT DART TALKED TO 
SAID THEY HAD BEEN TRYING TO CROSS FROM SECTOR WEST INTO 
BOSNIA FOR THE LAST YEAR, BUT WERE PREVENTED FROM DOING SO 
BY BOSNIAN SERB TROOPS.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT THEY WERE 
PREVENTED FROM DOING SO EVEN DURING THE RETREAT FROM 
SECTOR WEST DURING THE CROATIAN OFFENSIVE.

6.  EMBOFFS WERE TOLD BY DETENTION CENTER OFFICIALS THAT 
SERB MILITARY LEADERS AND THOSE SUSPECTED OF WAR CRIMES 
WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE BJELOVAR JAIL.  CROAT OFFICIALS 
HAD NO OBJECTIONS TO OUR REQUEST TO VISIT THE JAIL.  WHEN 
WE ARRIVED, HOWEVER, WE WERE TOLD THAT WE COULD NOT VISIT 
THE PRISONERS WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION FROM THE JUSTICE 
MINISTRY IN ZAGREB.  (NOTE: EMBASSY IS REQUESTING 
AUTHORIZATION AND HOPES TO VISIT THE BJELOVAR JAIL AGAIN 
ON MAY 11.)  WE DID TALK WITH PRISON ADMINISTRATOR ZDRAVKO 
BREBER AND CHIEF MILITARY JUDGE MIHAEL MALCIC.  BREBER 
TOLD US THAT INITIALLY THERE WERE 781 DETAINEES IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

BJELOVAR AND THAT 49 HAD BEEN RELEASED MAY 8 AND ANOTHER 
GROUP OF 138 ON MAY 7. 
 
7.  THE CITY PRISON IN BJELOVAR IS BEING CONVERTED TO A 
MILITARY PRISON AND WILL TAKE ALL TRANSFERS FROM OTHER 
DETENTION CENTERS IN VARAZDIN AND POZEGA.  AS OF MAY 8 
THERE WERE 48 DETAINEES IN THE PRISON AND OFFICIALS 
EXPECTED TO GET 50 TRANSFERS FROM VARAZDIN ON MAY 9 AND 
POSSIBLY ANOTHER 10 FROM THE BJELOVAR SPORTS CENTER. 
(NOTE: BREBER TOLD US THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN HIS GUARD 
FORCE AND DETAINEES WERE GOOD AND, IN FACT, TWO OF FOUR 
GUARDS ON THE AFTERNOON SHIFT WERE ETHNIC SERBS.)  IN 
TOTAL, BREBER ANTICIPATED HAVING OVER 100 PRISONERS, BUT 
JUDGE MALCIC SAID PROBABLY THAT ONLY 20 TO 30 WOULD BE 
CHARGED WITH WAR CRIMES.  THE DECISION TO TRANSFER 
DETAINEES TO THE JAIL FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS MADE 
DURING THE INITIAL INTERVIEW AND IS LARGELY BASED ON 
EVIDENCE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED BY CROATIAN DISPLACED 
PERSONS. 
 
8.  BREBER CONFIRMED THAT TWO OF THE THREE PRISONERS -- 
MLADEN KULIC AND STEVO HARAMBASIC -- ABOUT WHOM SERB 
LEADER VELJKO DJAKULA HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN ON MAY 9 WERE 
BEING HELD IN THE PRISON, BUT THEY HAD NO INFORMATION ON 
THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE THIRD, SAVO RADOSEVIC.  KULIC WAS 
BEING HELD ON CHARGES OF ARMED REBELLION AND CRIMES 
AGAINST CIVILIANS, WHILE HARAMBASIC WAS HELD UNDER A COURT 
ORDER, BUT NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE.  WE WERE 
TOLD THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CASES WAS FILED 
AT THE MILITARY COURT IN OSIJEK.  BOTH PRISONERS HAD REEN 
REGISTERED WITH ICRC, ACCORDING TO BREBER.  MALCIC SAID 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01801  02 OF 03  101545Z 
THAT ALL PRISONERS HELD UNDER CHARGES OF ARMED REBELLION 
WOULD BE RELEASED, BUT WE ARE UNSURE OF KULIC\'S STATUS 
GIVEN THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE OF CRIMES AGAINST CIVILIANS. 
 
9.  MALCIC SAID THAT HE IS LEADING A TEAM OF 9 JUDGES AND 
TYPISTS TO PROCESS 1,500 CASES.  BY 1500 ON MAY 9 HIS 
STAFF HAD QUESTIONED 24 PEOPLE AND WOULD BE INTERVIEWING 
ANOTHER 15 THAT DAY.  A GROUP OF TRANSFERS FROM VARAZDIN 
WAS DUE TO BE PROCESSED ON MAY 10.  HE SAID THAT THE COURT 
IS MOVING AS FAST AS IT CAN, BUT THE PROCESS IS SLOW 
LARGELY BECAUSE OF CONSTANT REQUESTS FROM ZAGRER FOR 
UPDATES AND STATISTICS.  SPECIFIC CRIMES THE COURT IS 
LOOKING INTO INCLUDE MURDER, POISONING, AND DESTRUCTION OF 
PROPERTY.  HE SAID THAT DETAINEES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE 
DURING QUESTIONING AND MANY HAVE COMPLAINED THAT \"RSK\" 
POLITICIANS AND LEADERS HAVE CHEATED THEM.  MALCIC OPINED 
THAT HALF THE SERBS WHO DECIDE TO LEAVE FOR BOSNIA WILL 
EVENTUALLY RETURN TO CROATIA, SOME TO LIVE AND 
UNFORTUNATELY SOME TO FIGHT.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
10.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF THE 
DETENTION CENTER, CROATIAN AUTHORITIES WERE COOPERATIVE 
AND RESPONDED QUICKLY TO OUR REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND 
DOCUMENTS.  EMBOFFS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WALK AROUND THE 
EXERCISE FIELD UNESCORTED AND SAW NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF 
THE DETAINEES WERE MISTREATED.  WE WERE PERMITTED TO TALK 
WITH THE DETAINEES FREELY AND PRIVATELY.  IN SPITE OF THE 
FACT THAT THE DETAINEES WE VISITED ARE BEING WELL TREATED, 
THE GOC SEARCH FOR WAR CRIMINALS -- EVEN IF LIMITED TO THE 
SMALL NUMBER ESTIMATED BY MALCIC -- AND THE SLOWNESS OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PROCESSING DETAINEES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A POINT OF 
CONTENTION WITH KNIN.  DETAINEES REMAIN SUSPICIOUS OF 
CROATIAN AUTHORITIES, AND THEIR UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER 
TO REMAIN OR LEAVE WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE WELL PAST THE 
TIME THEY ARE RELEASED.  THE CRITICAL TEST WILL BE HOW 
EVENHANDEDLY THE GOC TREATS SERBS AND CROATS AS THEY 
RETURN TO THE AREA OF FORMER SECTOR WEST.

SUMMARY 
------- 
2.  AT A MAY 10 MEETING AT UN HQ IN ZAGREB, UNSYG SPECIAL 
REPRESENTATIVE YASUSHI AKASHI TOLD AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH 
THAT \"RSK PRESIDENT\" MILAN MARTIC APPEARED TO HAVE A 
\"FIRMER GRIP ON REALITY\" DURING THEIR DISCUSSIONS THE 
PREVLOUS DAY IN BELGRADE AND THAT THE \"HIGH POINT OF 
TENSIONS\" SEEMS TO HAVE PASSED.  HE DEFENDED HIS FAILURE 
TO INFORM ZAGREB DIPLOMATS OF MARTIC\'S THREAT TO BOMB THE 
CITY BY SAYING HE BELIEVED IT WAS A BLUFF, ONLY POSTURING. 
- 
3.  FOLLOWING HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH TUDJMAN\'S CHIEF OF 
STAFF SARINIC EARLIER IN THE DAY, AKASHI SAID HE FELT THE 
CROATS \"WERE TRYING HARD TO COOPERATE\" WITH THE UN IN 
\"SECTOR WEST.\"  THE UN\'S FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT HAD BEEN 
ALMOST COMPLETELY RESTORED AND SARINIC HAD AGREED TO UN 
MONITORING OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  NEVERTHELESS, AKASHI WAS 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SLOW PACE FOR THE RELEASE OF SERBIAN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

DETAINEES.  THE SERBS WERE STILL REQUIRING A \"SOLUTION\" TO 
SECTOR WEST BEFORE THEY WOULD COME TO THE NEGOTIATING 
TABLE IN GENEVA. 
 
4.  TURNING TO BOSNIA, AKASHI CLAIMED THAT SARAJEVO 
COMMANDER GENERAL RUPERT SMITH HAD WAFFLED ON THE DECISION 
TO CALL AIR STRIKES, INITIALLY ARGUING AGAINST THEM, LATER 
CHANGING HIS MIND, AND FINALLY COMING AROUND TO HIS 
ORIGINAL POSITION.  THE AMBASSADOR ARGUED THAT THE UN\'S 
PREFERENCE FOR TALKS AND ACCOMMODATION TO BRING THE SERRS 
AROUND HAD BEEN TRIED FOR THREE YEARS AND PROVEN A 
FAILURE.  THE TIME HAD COME TO SEND TO THE SERBS THE ONLY 
KIND OF SIGNAL THEY UNDERSTAND.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
MARTIC LESS \"DERANGED\"; FIRMER GRIP ON REALITY 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5.  AKASHI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HIS MEETING IN 
BELGRADE MAY 9 WITH THE \"RSK\" LEADERSHIP (MARTIC, MIKELIC, 
AND BABIC) WAS BETTER THAN THEIR PREVIOUS ENCOUNTER ON MAY 
5 IN KNIN.  HE FELT THAT THE HIGHEST POINT OF TENSION HAD 
PASSED.  ON MAY 5, AKASHI FOUND MARTIC \"UPTIGHT, NERVOUS, 
BITTER, DAZED BY DEFEAT AND SOMEWHAT DERANGED, SHOWING 
SIGNS OF HAVING LOST HIS GRIP ON REALITY.\"  ON MAY 9, HE 
SEEMED TO HAVE RECOVERED SOME OF HIS COMPOSURE, AND HE 
REFRAINED FROM REPEATING MOST OF THE THREATS HE HAD MADE 
AT THE EARLIER MEETING (INCLUDING FURTHER ROCKETING OF 
ZAGREB).  NEVERTHELESS, HE STILL HAD A LONG LIST OF 
GRIEVANCES AGAINST THE UN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01822  01 OF 05  111610Z 
6.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE U.S. WAS EXTREMELY CONCERNED 
THAT MARTIC\'S THREAT, IN THE MAY 5 MEETING, TO \"FLATTEN 
ZAGREB\" HAD NOT BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE DIPLOMATIC 
COMMUNITY IN ZAGREB.  AKASHI SAID THAT, DURING THE 
MEETING, MARTIC HAD INITIALLY THREATENED TO BOMB ZAGREB 
WITHIN 24 HOURS, THEN 48, AND FINALLY FOUR DAYS.  TOWARDS 
THE END OF THE TALKS, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING THE CROATS 
HAD A WEEK TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMANDS.  IN THE END, AKASHI 
CLAIMED, HE FELT THAT IT WAS MOSTLY BLUFF AND POSTURING 
AND THAT IF MARTIC SAW A SINCERE COMMITMENT AND REASONABLE 
SPEED IN RELEASING THE DETAINEES HE WOULD NOT FOLLOW 
THROUGH ON HIS THREAT.  AKASHI ALSO FELT THAT BY 
COMMUNICATING THE THREAT IT WOULD LEAD THE SERBS TO 
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY, WHICH WOULD 
BE PLAYING INTO THEIR HANDS. 
 
7.  THE AMBASSADOR INSISTED THAT, GIVEN AKASHI\'S 
DESCRIPTION OF MARTIC\'S STATE OF MIND, SUCH THREATS SHOULD 
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  LITTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN RISKED RY 
INFORMING THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY OF HIS CONVERSATION.

8.  AKASHI SAID THAT HE HAD MET WITH TUDJMAN\'S CHIEF OF 
STAFF SARINIC AND ACTING HEAD OF CROATIA\'S ARMED FORCES 
GENERAL CERVENKO EARLIER IN THE DAY.  HE BELIEVED THAT THE 
CROATS WERE \"TRYING HARD TO COOPERATE WITH US.\"  THE UN\'S 
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IN \"SECTOR WEST\" HAD BEEN ALMOST 
COMPLETELY RESTORED.  NEVERTHELESS, AKASHI WAS CONCERNED 
BY THE SLOWNESS OF PROCESSING THE SERB DETAINEES AND 
PERMITTING THEM TO LEAVE FOR BOSNIA OR RETURN TO THEIR 
HOMES IN CROATIA.  THE AMBASSADOR AGREED, RECOUNTING HOW 
HE HAD CALLED SARINIC FROM STARA GRADISKA TO OBJECT TO THE 
INEXCUSABLE DETENTION OF OLD MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM 
OKUCANI AND THERERY OBTAINED THEIR RELEASE. 
 
9.  AKASHI SAID THAT MARTIC SEEMED TO HAVE CUT BACK ON HIS 
EXPECTATIONS ALTHOUGH HE WAS STILL INSISTING ON A 
\"RESOLUTION\" IN \"SECTOR WEST.\"  IN THE MAY 9 MEETING THE 
SERBS HAD FOCUSSED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING HELD, 
THEIR TREATMENT, AND THE PROCEDURES FOR SCREENING.  (NOTE: 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

ICFY AMBASSADOR ALFREDO MATACOTTA TOLD US THAT AT THE 
MEETING ON MAY 9 EVEN MILOSEVIC WAS STILL INSISTING ON A 
RETURN TO THE STATUS QUO BEFORE THE CONFLICT IN SECTOR 
WEST.)  SARINIC HAD TOLD AKASHI THAT ONE OF THE DETAINEES 
WAS SUSPECTED OF KILLING 18 CROATS AND MAY BE TRIED FOR 
WAR CRIMES.  SINCE THE MAY 3 CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES 
AGREEMENT CALLED FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL PRISONERS WITHOUT 
ANY EXCEPTIONS, AKASHI WAS CONCERNED THAT THE SERRS WOULD 
REACT VERY NEGATIVELY IF THE CROATS FAIL TO COMPLY. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
CROATS AGREE TO MONITORING OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN SECTOR WEST 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
10.  IN THE SARINIC-AKASHI MEETING IT WAS AGREED THAT THE 
UN COULD MONITOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SECTOR. 
SPECIFICALLY, IT WAS AGREED THAT THE UN WOULD: 
 
- SUPPORT AND FACILITATE THE RETURN OF PEOPLE TO THEIR 
HOMES OR HELP TRANSPORT THEM TO BOSNIA IF SO DESIRED, 
 
- MONITOR THE RETURN OF DISPLACED PEOPLE TO THE SECTOR, 
 
- ASSIST WITH DEMINING AND IMPLEMENTING THE ECONOMIC 
AGREEMENT, 
 
- ASSURE PASSAGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN FRIENDS AND 
RELATIVES, 
 
- MONITOR PRISONS AND DETENTION CENTERS, 
 
- PROTECT MINORITIES, AND 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

- MONITOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN GENERAL. 
 
THESE NEAR- TERM TASKS WOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN COOPERATION 
WITH UNHCR, ECMM, AND ICRC.  TO THAT END, A COORDINATION 
GROUP HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
SERBS STILL BALKING AT TALKS WITH CROATS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11.  AFTER \"SECTOR WEST,\" AKASHI SAID HIS NEXT PRIORITY 
WAS TO EASE TENSIONS IN THE OTHER SECTORS, ESPECIALLY 
SECTOR EAST.  THE CROATS HAVE PROPOSED A MEETING OF THE 
MILITARY COMMANDERS BUT THE SERBS HAVE BEEN DRAGGING THEIR 
FEET, INSISTING ON A SOLUTION IN \"SECTOR WEST\" FIRST. 
MILOSEVIC HAD ARGUED THAT THERE COULD BE NO MILITARY 
SOLUTION WITHOUT A POLITICAL SOLUTION COMING OUT OF FACE 
TO FACE TALKS IN GENEVA.

SUBJECT:  AKASHI SAYS TENSION LOWER IN \"RSK\"; DEFENDS 
          DECISION ON AIR STRIKES 
 
12.  AKASHI SAID THAT SARINIC WAS WILLING TO HOLD BOTH 
MILITARY AND POLITICAL TALKS AND AGREED TO HOLD AT LEAST 
THE INITIAL TALKS IN GENEVA (WITH SUBSEQUENT TALKS IN 
CROATIA).  MEANWHILE, THE UN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE THE 
SERBS NOT TO TACKLE THE ISSUES SEQUENTIALLY (I.E., 
INSISTING ON RESOLVING \"SECTOR WEST\" FIRST) BUT RATHER 
OPEN UP DISCUSSION TO ALL ISSUES SIMULTANEOUSLY. 
 
13.  WHEN ASKED IF THE SERBS UNDERSTOOD THAT RESOLVING 
\"SECTOR WEST\" DID NOT MEAN A RETURN OF \"RSK\" AUTHORITY IN 
THE SECTOR, AKASHI SAID THAT HE WAS NOT SURE.  MIKELIC, 
ALTHOUGH HE MOUTHED MARTIC\'S DEMANDS, SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT THE BASIS FOR NEGOTIATIONS WAS THE MAY 3 AGREEMENT 
(I.E., A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES, SURRENDER OF WEAPONS, 
AND THE CHOICE OF REMAINING IN CROATIA OR LEAVING FOR 
BOSNIA) AND NOT THE MAY 2 AGREEMENT WHICH CALLED FOR A 
RETURN TO THE ST 
ATUS QUO ANTE. 
 
14.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT THE USG STRONGLY SUPPORTED 
THE RETURN OF UN AUTHORITY IN THE SECTOR, ESPECIALLY IN 
THE AREA OF MONITORING HUMAN RIGHTS.  AKASHI REPLIED THAT 
THE UN WOULD SOON BE NEEDING GUIDANCE FROM THE SECURITY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

BE VERY HELPFUL IF THE USG WERE TO TAKE SUCH A POSITION. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
AKASHI CLAIMS SMITH WAFFLED, ARGUED AGAINST ON AIR STRIKES 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
15.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE USG WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AT 
THE UN\'S FAILURE TO RESPOND MORE FORCEFULLY TO THE RECENT 
SERB ATTACKS AROUND SARAJEVO IN CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE 
HEAVY WEAPONS EXCLUSION ZONE. 
 
16.  AKASHI CLAIMED THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY, 
GENERAL RUPERT SMITH INITIALLY CAME DOWN AGAINST AIR 
STRIKES.  A FEW HOURS LATER, SMITH APPARENTLY CHANGED HIS 
MIND AND CALLED FOR AIR STRIKES, WHICH WERE DENIED BASED 
ON SMITH\'S PREVIOUS ARGUMENTS.  A FEW HOURS LATER, AKASHI 
SAID, SMITH CAME AROUND TO HIS ORIGINAL POSITION.  AKASHI 
QUOTED FROM THE GENERAL\'S INITIAL ANALYSIS, WHICH WE 
PROVIDE BELOW. 
 
17.  BEGIN TEXT AS HEARD. 
 
BEFORE REQUESTING NATO TO ATTACK IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE A 
CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE EXCLUSION ZONE THERE ARE CERTAIN 
FACTORS WHICH NEED TO BE BORNE IN MIND. 
 
A.  THE AIR STRIKES MIGHT NOT STOP THE SERB ATTACKS. 
- 
B.  UNPROFOR IN BOSNIA IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE FROM THE 
SERBS DUE TO EVENTS IN CROATIA AND GETTING CONVOY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 

 
 
 
 
 
                           CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01822  03 OF 05  111610Z 
CLEARANCE HAS BECOME HARDER. 
 
C.  IT CAN BE ANTICIPATED THAT SUCH A RESPONSE WILL HAVE 
AN IMPACT ON THE CROATIAN SITUATION AND THE ONGOING 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE KRAJINA SERBS. 
 
D.  UNPROFOR IS NOT IN TOUCH WITH MLADIC OR OTHER BOSNIAN 
SERB LEADERS. 
 
E.  IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO 
PROVOKE AN INTERNATIONAL REACTION AND THE BOSNIAN SERBS 
MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO SEIZE HOSTAGES. 
 
SO, MILITARY ACTION MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OBJECTIVES 
AND MAY HAVE FAR-REACHING NEGATIVE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES.

OUTWEIGHED THE ADVANTAGES.  SINCE AT THAT TIME THE UN WAS 
ENGAGED IN DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS IN KNIN AND SINCE AN AIR 
STRIKE, UNLIKE CLOSE AIR SUPPORT WHERE LIVES ARE AT RISK, 
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE CARRIED OUT IMMEDIATELY, (HE NOTED THE 
DELAYED STRIKE ON UDBINA AIRFIELD), AKASHI AND JANVIER 
FELT THEY HAD TIME TO REFLECT AND ANALYZE. 
 
19.  THEY CONSULTED WITH NEW YORK AND THE UNSYG IN MOSCOW 
AND, CONSIDERING \"THE TERRIBLE MOOD OF THE BOSNIAN SERBS,\" 
DECIDED THAT AIR STRIKES MIGHT HAVE MEANT THE END OF THE 
UN MISSION IN BOSNIA.  \"AND MAY STILL,\" AKASHI ADDED. 
 
---------------------------- 
BOSNIAN SERBS UNDER PRESSURE 
---------------------------- 
 
20.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THE BOSNIAN SERBS ARE 
UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE.  THEIR SITUATION WAS GROWING 
WORSE AS THAT OF THE ROSNIAN GOVERNMENT GREW STRONGER, 
WHICH EXPLAINED WHY THEY WERE DESPERATELY TRYING TO FOR A 
DECISION NOW.  HENCE, THE ATTACKS ON SAFE HAVENS, THE 
CLOSING DOWN OF THE AIRPORT AND CONVOYS, AND THE ATTACKS 
ON PEACEKEEPERS.  THE UN NEEDED TO SHOW RESOLVE, INCLUDING 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

AIR STRIKES, SO THAT THE SERBS WOULD UNDERSTAND THEY 
CANNOT GET AWAY WITH THEIR STRATEGY. 
 
21.  AKASHI EXPRESSED HIS DOUBT THAT AIR POWER ALONE COULD 
DO IT.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT NATO HAS 
CONSIDERABLE AIR POWER.  AKASHI ARGUED THAT UNDER THOSE 
CIRCUMSTANCES UN PEACEKEEPERS WOULD HAVE TO BE WITHDRAWN. 
THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF 
HARM\'S WAY, ESPECIALLY POTENTIAL HOSTAGES LIKE THE UN 
MILITARY OBSERVERS.  AKASHI SAID THE UN HAD NOT DONE THAT 
YET AND NEEDED ADVANCE NOTICE.  HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT AIR 
STRIKES MIGHT SOLIDIFY THE POSITION OF THE EXTREMISTS. 
THE AMBASSADOR COUNTERED THAT IT MIGHT HAVE THE OPPOSITE 
EFFECT, NOTING THAT MARTIC APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN 
CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED AFTER 
 THE CROATIAN ACTION IN SECTOR 
WEST. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
\"TRIED UN WAY FOR THREE YEARS, NOW ITS TIME TO TRY OURS\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
22.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT THE UN HAD TRIED AKASHI\'S 
APPROACH OF NEGOTIATION AND ACCOMMODATION FROM THE 
BEGINNING OF THE CONFLICT AND THE RESULT HAD REEN THAT THE 
BOSNIAN SERBS HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO GET AWAY WITH 
OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT.  MEANWHILE, THE ONLY SUCCESSES WE HAD 
SEEN TO DATE HAD BEEN AFTER A CREDIBLE THREAT OF USE OF 
FORCE SUCH AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EXCLUSION ZONE 
FOLLOWING THE MARKET PLACE MASSACRE IN SARAJEVO.  THE UN 
AND NATO HAVE ALREADY AGREED ON HOW TO RESPOND TO THESE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SITUATIONS, HE ARGUED, \"YOU\'VE TRIED YOUR WAY FOR THREE 
YEARS, NOW IT\'S TIME TO TRY OURS.\" 
 
23.  AKASHI CAUTIONED THAT THE UN PEACEKEEPERS WERE 
VULNERABLE.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THEY WERE BEING 
TARGETED ANYHOW.  THE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO HUNKER DOWN 
UNTIL THE SERBS WERE FORCED TO BACK OFF.  IF ENOUGH PAIN 
WAS INFLICTED THE SERBS WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HONOR 
THE SAFE HAVENS AND REOPEN THE AIRPORT. 
 
24.  UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, AKASHI ARGUED, THE UN 
WOULD BE UNABLE TO PROTECT THE ENCLAVES, KEEP THE AIRPORT 
OPEN AND PROVIDE SAFE PASSAGE FOR CONVOYS.  HOWEVER, IN 
RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTIONING HE ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT TWO MONTHS HAD GONE BY WITH NO CONVOYS TO THE 
ENCLAVES AND THE AIRPORT HAD BEEN CLOSED FOR A MONTH WITH 
LITTLE PROSPECT FOR ANY CHANGE IN THE PRESENT SITUATION. 
THE AMBASSADOR ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE UN WAS SUFFERING 
TREMENDOUS DAMAGE TO ITS IMAGE BY ALLOWING ITSELF TO BE 
HELD UP BY A BUNCH OF THUGS.

          DECISION ON AIR STRIKES 
 
 
25.  AKASHI NOTED THAT, SINCE THE 1956 SUEZ CRISIS, THE 
UN\'S PEACEKEEPING POLICY HAD BEEN THE IMPARTIAL 
POSITIONING OF TROOPS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES IN A CONFLICT, 
USING FORCE ONLY IN SELF-DEFENSE.  SO FAR, THERE HAD BEEN 
NO CLEAR DECISION BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL OR THE TROOP 
CONTRIBUTING NATIONS THAT A MORE ROBUST, \"MUSCULAR USE OF 
FORCE\" WAS CALLED FOR.  \"IT MAY COME TO THAT,\" HE SAID, 
\"BUT FOR NOW THE SECURITY COUNCIL APPEARS TO HAVE OPTED 
FOR THE MORE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF PEACEKEEPING.\" 
 
26.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF 
PEACEKEEPING IS APPLICABLE WHEN THERE ARE TWO SIDES THAT 
WANT PEACE, WHICH WAS CLEARLY NOT THE CASE IN THE FORMER 
YUGOSLAVIA WHERE THE SERBS HAD SHOWN THAT THEY ONLY 
UNDERSTOOD THE USE OF FORCE. 
 
27.  AKASHI ASKED THE AMBASSADOR TO CONSIDER THE UN\'S 
CAPACITY IN THE REGION, ARGUING THAT ITS FORCES WERE 
NEITHER EQUIPPED, NOR TRAINED, NOR CONFIGURED TO FIGHT A 
WAR AGAINST A NON-COOPERATING PARTY.  UN OBSERVATION POSTS 
WERE LOCATED BETWEEN THE FRONT LINES ONLY BECAUSE THE 
SIDES RESPECT THE UN\'S IMPARTIALITY.  THE AMBASSADOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

RESPECT THE UN\'S NEUTRALITY AND THEREFORE CONSIDERATION 
SHOULD BE GIVEN TO MOVE EXPOSED UN FORCES SUCH AS UNMOS 
OUT OF HARM\'S WAY AS A PRELUDE TO SERIOUS USE OF FORCE. 
HE REITERATED THE POINT THAT THE UN\'S EFFORTS FOR A 
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION HAD NOT WORKED.  THE BOSNIAN SERB 
LEADERS WERE NOT REASONABLE PEOPLE.  AKASHI READILY AGREED

SUBJECT:  CROATIA UPDATE NO. 36:  U.S., UN, EXPLORING 
          CROAT TREATMENT OF SERBS IN WESTERN SLAVONIA 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  VARIOUS UN ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY CIVPOL, 
ARE STRENGTHENING THEIR EFFORTS TO MONITOR AND 
INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS FOR SERBS IN \"SECTOR WEST.\" 
MANY UN OFFICIALS SAY THEY STILL SUSPECT THERE WERE AT 
LEAST SOME HUMAN RIGHTS TRANSGRESSIONS BY CROATIAN 
FORCES DURING AND AFTER THE MAY 1 OFFENSIVE, AND ARE 
UNEASY THAT LITTLE SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OF CROATIAN 
WRONGDOING HAS TURNED UP SO FAR. 
 
2.  (LOU) EMBASSY\'S INVESTIGATION OF CROAT TREATMENT OF 
MILITARY DETAINEES AND CIVILIANS CONTINUES TODAY WITH 
POLOFFS\' RETURN VISIT TO BJELOVAR (SITE OF ONE 
DETENTION CENTER, WHERE WE EXPECT TO INTERVIEW SOME OF 
THE DETAINEES); STARA GRADISKA TO CHECK THE STATUS OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

THE TOWN AND POSSIBLY INTERVIEW SOME OF THE BOSNIA- 
BOUND SERBS; AND OTHER LOCATIONS.  OUR REQUEST TO THE 
UN TO BE ABLE TO INTERVIEW SOME OF THE NEPALI TROOPS IN 
THE AREA WHO MIGHT HAVE WITNESSED ATROCITIES HAS BEEN 
TURNED DOWN BY UNCRO HEADQUARTERS, ALTHOUGH WE WERE 
TOLD WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INTERVIEW THEM HERE IN ZAGREB. 
 
3.  (C) ON MAY 11, E.J. FLYNN (PROTECT) OF THE UN 
CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (MAZOWIECKI COMMISSION) IN 
ZAGREB TOLD US HE IS TAKING A CAUTIOUS ATTITUDE ABOUT 
GIVING THE GOC A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
GROUNDS.  ALTHOUGH ADMITTING THE UN DOES NOT TAKE THE 
ACCUSATIONS OUT OF BELGRADE ABOUT A MASSACRE AT THE 
STARA GRADISKA BRIDGE TERRIBLY SERIOUSLY, HE SAID THERE 
WERE \"A NUMBER\" OF REPORTS OF INCIDENTS WHICH SUGGESTED 
THE CROATIAN ARMY (HV) MIGHT HAVE KILLED CIVILIANS 
DURING THEIR INITIAL OFFENSIVE.  FLYNN FOUND \"SUSPECT\" 
THE FACT THAT THERE HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE INFORMATION SO 
FAR ABOUT SERB CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THE AREA.  THE 
ONLY SPECIFIC INCIDENT HE RAISED, HOWEVER, WAS ONE THAT 
VELJO DJAKULA RAISED WITH THE AMBASSADOR MAY 8, IN 
WHICH SIX OF SEVEN PEOPLE TRYING TO ESCAPE PAKRAC IN A 
TRUCK AT NIGHT HAD APPARENTLY BEEN KILLED BY CROATIAN 
FIRE. 
 
4.  (C)  THE UN CENTRE ALSO HAS \"VARIOUS\" REPORTS OF 
MISTREATMENT AND PHYSICAL ABUSE OF MILITARY DETAINEES, 
PARTICULARLY AT THE VARAZDIN CENTER.  (NOTE:  EMBASSY 
HAS NOT YET VISITED THE VARAZDIN CENTER BUT WILL BE 
DOING SO IN THE NEAR FUTURE.)  FLYNN TOLD US THAT THE 
WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL WAS PLANNING TO SEND AN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO CROATIA NEXT WEEK; IT WOULD LOOK 
AT THE QUESTION OF THE ROCKET ATTACKS ON ZAGREB, AS 
WELL AS QUESTIONS OF CROAT TREATMENT OF SERBS. 
 
5.  (LOU)  UNCIVPOL COMMISSION SVEN FREDRIKSSON TOLD US 
MAY 11 THAT HE HAD ALREADY ADDED 70 ADDITIONAL CIVPOL 
OFFICERS IN FORMER SECTOR WEST, BRINGING THE TOTAL 
PRESENCE CURRENTLY TO 130.  HE EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO 
ADD 30 TO 40 MORE AS NEW INCOMING PERSONNEL WERE 
TRAINED.  CIVPOL IS CONTINUING AND EVEN AUGMENTING ITS 
PREVIOUSLY EXISTING PRESENCE IN \"THE NORTHERN PART OF 
SECTOR WEST\" (NOTE: THAT IS THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF 
THE FORMALLY DEFINED \"UNPA WEST\" WHICH HAS IN PRACTICAL 
TERMS BEEN CONTROLLED BY THE CROATS SINCE BEFORE 
UNPROFOR FORCES ARRIVED IN CROATIA.  BECAUSE A SMALL 
SERB MINORITY REMAINS IN THE AREA, THERE IS A 
LEGITIMATE \"REASSURANCE\" ROLE THERE FOR UNCIVPOL).  THE 
UN THOUGHT ITS HEIGHTENED VISIBILITY IN THIS AREA WOULD 
BE USEFUL; CIVPOL HAS ORDERS TO VISIT \"EVERY VILLAGE 
EVERY DAY.\"

E.O. 12356:  DECL 5/11/00 
TAGS:  PHUM MOPS HR UN 
SUBJECT:  CROATIA UPDATE NO. 36:  U.S., UN, EXPLORING 
          CROAT TREATMENT OF SERBS IN WESTERN SLAVONIA 
 
WOULD BE DEDICATED TO THE \"SOUTHERN PART OF SECTOR 
WEST,\" I.E., THE AREA RECENTLY RETAKEN BY THE CROATS. 
FREDRIKSSON SAID HE AND OTHERS HAD VISITED ALL THE 
VILLAGES IN THE PAKRAC AND GAVRILICA AREAS ON MAY 10. 
CIVPOL WOULD CONDUCT \"DISPATCHED\" (I.E. ROVING) PATROLS 
BUT WOULD ALSO HAVE STATIONARY POSTS IN THE MOST 
SENSITIVE AREAS.  CIVPOL HAD RETURNED TO OKUCANI MAY 10 
AND WOULD BE ABLE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION THERE WITH A 
TOTAL OF 16 OFFICERS.  IN ALL AREAS, THE CIVPOL VIEWED 
ITS MISSION AS GATHERING SOUND, VERIFIABLE INFORMATION 
ON POSSIBLE CRIMES AND INCIDENTS, AND REASSURANCE OF 
THE MINORITY POPULATION. 
 
7. (C)  CIVPOL NOW HAS ALMOST COMPLETE FREEDOM OF 
MOVEMENT AND HAS FOUND THE CROATS EXTREMELY 
COOPERATIVE.  FREDRIKSSON SAID THERE HAD BEEN \"ONLY\" 
THREE CASES IN WHICH CROATIAN OFFICIALS HAD SOUGHT TO 
DENY ACCESS (AND EXPLAINED THE WORD \"ONLY\" BY SAYING, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 

 
 
 
 
 
                           CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01824  02 OF 02  111827Z 
\"I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED MANY MORE\").  WHEN MILITARY 
POLICE IN ONE VILLAGE NEAR PAKRAC DENIED CIVPOL ACCESS, 
THE CROATIAN CIVILIAN POLICE AUTHORITIES ON THE SCENE 
HAD GONE TO HIGHER AUTHORITY AND GOT THE MILITARY 
POLICE DECISION REVERSED, ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE GOC 
HAD ORDERED \"FULL COOPERATION WITH THE UN.\"  WHEN 
CIVPOL OFFICERS WHO RETURNED TO THEIR FORMER OFFICES IN 
OKUCANI FOUND THEM OCCUPIED BY THE HV -- BUT THE 
CROATIAN SOLDIERS DID RELINQUISH THE SPACE ON REQUEST. 
(ALL THE OFFICE EQUIPMENT WAS MISSING, WHETHER TAKEN BY 
SERBS OR CROATS, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY).  ON THE 
OTHER HAND, CIVPOL PERSONNEL INVESTIGATING A REPORT OF 
A GRAVE DESECRATION IN OKUCANI GOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE 
THAT A GRAVE APPEARED TO BE OPEN, AND TO DETECT A 
\"POWERFUL ODOR,\" BUT WERE TURNED AWAY BY MILITARY 
POLICE.  (THIS INCIDENT WILL BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER.) 
 
8.  (C)  FREDRIKSSON SEEMED TO SHARE FLYNN\'S VIEW THAT 
MORE INCIDENTS WOULD COME TO LIGHT.  HE SAID CIVPOL HAD 
FIELDED \"LOTS OF COMPLAINTS,\" AND FELT THERE WAS NO 
DOUBT THAT \"WRONGDOING\" HAD OCCURRED, THOUGH CIVPOL HAD 
DETECTED NO PATTERN OF ABUSE BUT RATHER, ISOLATED 
INCIDENTS.  THE UN, HE THOUGHT, NEEDED TO \"FLOOD THE 
AREA\" WITH OBSERVERS TO DEVELOP \"QUALITY INFORMATION\" 
TO BE ABLE TO CONFIRM OR REFUTE REPORTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS.  FREDRIKSSON ALSO ECHOED A POINT WE HAVE 
HEARD FROM SOME CROATIAN CONTACTS, I.E. THAT THE 
CROATIAN POLICE WERE TURNING FOR ASSISTANCE IN 
ADMINISTERING THE AREA TO PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN MEMBERS 
OF THE \"DOMOBRAN\" (LOCAL MILITIA) IN THE AREA BEFORE 
THE WAR.  THESE, HE THOUGHT, WERE \"EXACTLY THE WRONG 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 

 
 
 
 
 
                           CONFIDENTIAL

PEOPLE TO USE\" BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HARBOR GRUDGES.  HE 
HAD EXPRESSED HIS MISGIVING TO THE CROATIAN POLICE, WHO 
COUNTERED THAT THESE PEOPLE\'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA 
MADE THEM INVALUABLE. 
 
9.  COMMENT:  IN SUM, THERE IS A SENSE OF UNEASE AMONG 
UN PERSONNEL THAT, DESPITE THE LACK OF EVIDENCE SO FAR 
ON THE GROUND, SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS REMAIN 
TO BE UNCOVERED.  ECHOING THIS ATTITUDE, UN CIVIL 
AFFAIRS CHIEF FOR CROATIA JAQUE GRINBERG TOLD POLOFF 
MAY 11 THAT THE ORIGINAL MOVE IN NEW YORK TOWARD 
CENSURE OF THE CROATIAN ACTION HAD \"NOT BEEN 
PREMATURE,\" IMPLYING THAT UN\'S JUDGMENT WOULD YET BE 
VINDICATED.  WE BELIEVE THERE ARE CERTAINLY INCIDENTS 
WHICH REQUIRE FULL INVESTIGATION, AND HAVE MADE CLEAR 
TO UN OFFICIALS THAT OUR OWN EFFORTS WILL LIKEWISE 
EXPLORE ALL AVENUES TO ASCERTAIN THE FACTS.

REF:  ZAGREB 001867 
 
1.  FOREIGN MINISTER GRANIC CALLED AT 12 NOON, 
MAY 16, TO SAY THAT CROATIAN ARMY FORCES HAD 
WITHDRAWN COMPLETELY FROM THE POSITIONS IN THE 
ZONE OF SEPARATION (ZOS) IN SECTOR SOUTH THAT 
HAD BEEN OCCUPIED SINCE MAY 1.  GRANIC AGAIN 
ASSURED ME THAT ALL FORCES WOULD BE BACK TO THE 
PRE-MAY 1 POSITIONS IN THE SECTORS NORTH AND 
EAST ZOS BY 5:00 P.M. LOCAL TIME, MAY 16 
(REFTEL). 
- 
2.  BOTH THE CROATIAN ARMY AND THE RSK HAD 
FORCES IN THE ZOS BEFORE MAY 1.  THIS PRESENCE, 
WHICH RELATES TO DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF 
THE MAPS FOR THE MARCH 29, 1994 CEASE-FIRE 
AGREEMENT AS WELL AS SOME PRE-EXISTING WILLFUL 
VIOLATIONS, IS NOT AFFECTED BY CROATIA\'S 
WITHDRAWAL PROMISE.  THUS THERE WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE VIOLATIONS OF THE ZOS AFTER THE DEADLINE. 
THE PRE-EXISTING VIOLATIONS ARE LESS DANGEROUS 
THAN THOSE THAT OCCURRED THIS MONTH, AND UNCRO 
PRESUMABLY WILL BE REASONABLY SATISFIED IF IT 
CAN ACHIEVE THE PRE-MAY STATUS QUO IN THE ZOS.

NOT BE IN A POSITION TO CONFIRM THE CROATIAN 
WITHDRAWAL (ASSUMING THERE IS A FULL WITHDRAWAL) 
UNTIL MAY 17. 
 
4.  GRANIC TOLD ME THAT 180 OF THE 1400 SERB 
DETAINEES FROM WESTERN SLAVONIA ARE UNDER

SEVEN WERE AMNESTIED YESTERDAY AND HE SAID THE

SUMMARY 
------- 
- 
1. ON MAY 12, POLOFF VISITED THE GYMNASIUM BEING USED AS A 
MAKESHIFT DETENTION CENTER IN VARAZDIN WHERE OVER FIVE 
HUNDRED SERB MEN FROM SECTOR WEST HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY 
CROATIAN AUTHORITIES ON MAY 5 (AND WHICH WAS EMPTY BY MAY 
16).  THE VISIT WAS PROMPTED BY ALLEGATIONS OF PHYSICAL 
MISTREATMENT AND ABUSE WHICH HAD BEEN PICKED UP BY THE UN 
AND ICRC (REFTEL).  POLOFF FOUND NO HARD EVIDENCE OF 
PHYSICAL MISTREATMENT, BUT THE ATTITUDES OF THE CROATIAN 
POLICE TOWARD SUSPECTED \"WAR CRIMINALS\" LED POLOFF TO 
BELIEVE THAT POLICE COULD HAVE BEEN OVERZEALOUS IN THEIR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
TRIED TO PROCESS QUICKLY, BUT 139 STILL THERE AFTER 8 DAYS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
2. THE LOCAL POLICE CHIEF TOLD POLOFF THAT, ON JUST A FEW 
HOURS NOTICE, 532 SERB MEN HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO VARAZDIN ON 
MAY 5.  THE SAME DAY, ALL OF THE MEN OVER 55 AND UNDER 20 
HAD BEEN RELEASED, NINETY-THREE IN TOTAL.  THE POLICE THEN 
BEGAN TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITIES OF THE REMAINING 
439 DETAINEES THROUGH DOCUMENT CHECKS, PHOTOGRAPHS, AND 
FINGERPRINTING.  THESE MEN WERE THEN CHECKED AGAINST 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT RECORDS FOR ANY EVIDENCE OF \"WAR 
CRIMES.\" 
 
3. FROM MAY 6 UNTIL MAY 13 (WHEN THE CENTER WAS CLOSED), 
THE LOCAL POLICE PROCESSED ALL THE REMAINING SERBS. OF THE 
439 DETAINEES, 206 WERE RELEASED DIRECTLY BACK TO PAKRAC, 
AND 219 WERE SENT FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION BY MILITARY 
INVESTIGATIVE COURTS.  NINETY PERCENT OF THE LATTER WERE 
SENT TO THE MILITARY COURT IN BJELOVAR.  THE REMAINING 
FOURTEEN MEN WERE TRANSFERRED TO BJELOVAR TO GIVE 
TESTIMONY AS WITNESSES AGAINST THEIR FELLOW DETAINEES.  ON 
MAY 16, THE VARAZDIN AUTHORITIES SAID THEY DID NOT KNOW 
HOW MANY OF THE 233 MEN TRANSFERRED TO THE MILITARY COURTS 
HAD BEEN RELEASED AND HOW MANY WERE STILL BEING HELD. 
(NOTE:  PRESS REPORTS ON MAY 16 SAID THAT 220 SERBS, OF 
ALL THOSE HELD IN BJELOVAR ORIGINALLY OR TRANSFERRED FROM 
VARAZDIN, WERE STILL BEING HELD IN THE BJELOVAR DISTRICT

4. IN VARAZDIN, POLOFF WAS GIVEN FREE RUN OF THE SPORTS

12 WERE BEING HELD.  THE MEN WERE ALL LYING ON MATTRESSES 
ON THE MAIN GYM FLOOR.  FOR TWO MEALS A DAY AND SMOKING 
PRIVILEGE, WEATHER PERMITTING, THE MEN WERE TAKEN EN MASSE 
TO AN OUTDOOR PLAYGROUND.  INTERROGATIONS WERE HELD IN

EVER TAKEN AWAY ALONE FROM THE GROUP, EXCEPT WHEN GOING UP 
TO THE INTERVIEW ROOMS.  NONE RECALLED ANY DETAINEES NOT 
RETURNING FROM THEIR INTERROGATIONS, OR COMING BACK WITH 
OBVIOUS INJURIES OR BLEEDING. 
 
6. ASKED IF THERE HAD BEEN BEATINGS OR MISTREATMENT, NONE 
OF THE PRISONERS CITED ANY SPECIFIC CASES.  THEY ALL 
REPORTED THEY HAD SUFFERED NO ILL TREATMENT (ONE ADDED, 
\"GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES\").  BUT THEY COULD NOT, OR WOULD 
NOT, SAY THAT NO BEATINGS HAD TAKEN PLACE.  ONE MAN SAID, 
\"YOU WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO OTHERS TO FIND OUT,\" BUT WOULD 
NOT PROVIDE ANY FURTHER DETAILS.  ASKED IF THEY WERE 
AFRAID, THEY ALL SAID THEIR REAL FEAR WAS CAUSED BY THE 
UNCERTAINTY OF WHERE THEY WERE GOING.  (NOTE: OF THE 139 
STILL THERE THAT DAY, THE CROATIANS SAY THEY TRANSFERRED 
74 TO BJELOVAR AS POSSIBLE SUSPECTS.)

7. ASKED IF THEY PLANNED TO REMAIN IN CROATIA AFTER THEIR

THAT DECISION BASED ON CONDITIONS BACK IN PAKRAC ONCE THEY

HOWEVER, IS WHETHER VIOLENCE WAS USED AGAINST THE

DETAINEES.  DESPITE RUMORS PICKED UP BY INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS OF PRISONERS BEATEN IN VARAZDIN, POLOFF 
FOUND NO HARD EVIDENCE ON THE SCENE MAY 12 TO INDICATE 
THIS WAS THE CASE.  IN WALKING THROUGH THE ROWS OF 
DETAINEES, POLOFF COULD NOT EASILY SEE ANY SIGNS OF WOUNDS 
OR BEATINGS.  (NOTE: IN PAKRAC MAY 16, EMBOFFS FOUND 2 
SERBS RECENTLY RELEASED FROM BJELOVAR WHO SHOWED US 
BRUISES THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE RECEIVED IN VARAZDIN.  SEE

9. THE ATTITUDE AND COMMENTS OF THE LOCAL POLICE, HOWEVER, 
SUGGEST THAT THERE MAY WELL HAVE BEEN ROUGH TREATMENT OF 
THOSE DETAINEES WHO THE POLICE BELIEVED HAD PARTICIPATED 
IN ATROCITIES.  THE POLICE DREW A CLEAR DISTINCTION 
BETWEEN THOSE DETAINEES WHO HAD NOT PARTICIPATED IN CRIMES 
AGAINST CROATIA OR CIVILIANS, OR HAD MERELY FOLLOWED

10. BUT FOR THE LATTER GROUP (OR THOSE EVEN SUSPECTED OF 
BELONGING TO THE LATTER GROUP), THE ATTITUDE WAS MUCH MORE 
HARD-NOSED.  THE POLICE WERE CATEGORICAL THAT ANYONE WHO 
WAS GUILTY OF \"WAR CRIMES,\" AS DEFINED BY THE CROATIAN 
AUTHORITIES, SHOULD BE HELD, PROSECUTED, AND PUNISHED, 
REGARDLESS OF THE TERMS OF THE CEASEFIRE IN SECTOR WEST. 
THERE WAS NO RECEPTIVENESS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT, UNDER 
THE TERMS OF THE CEASEFIRE, THE POLICE SHOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN INVESTIGATING THE DETAINEES OR HOLDING SUSPECTED WAR 
CRIMINALS.  AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THE POLICE 
WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACT WITH ANY TENDERNESS OR CARE 
TOWARD SUCH SUSPECTS.  OUR GUESS IS THAT THE MORE SERIOUS 
THE CRIME A DETAINEE WAS SUSPECTED OF, THE ROUGHER HIS

11. THE GUARDED COMMENTS OF THE DETAINEES (\"OUR TREATMENT 
IS SATISFACTORY, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES\"), AND THE 
APPEARANCE OF THOSE STILL IN THE SPORTS HALL, HOWEVER, 
SUGGESTED THAT WHATEVER ROUGH TREATMENT BY THE POLICE 
OCCURRED WAS NOT SYSTEMATIC AND WAS LIMITED (I.E., NO 
MURDERS, DISAPPEARANCES, OR INJURIES SERIOUS ENOUGH TO 
REQUIRE MEDICAL TREATMENT).  FINAL CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING 
POLICE TREATMENT OF DETAINEES WILL REQUIRE FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION, ESPECIALLY OF THE DETAINEES SUSPECTED OF 
THE MOST SERIOUS CRIMES, WHO ARE NOW HELD IN THE MILITARY 
PRISON IN BJELOVAR.  EMBASSY ALSO INTENDS TO PUSH THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW FULLER ACCESS TO ICRC, WHICH 
HAS COMPLAINED TO US OF LIMITS IMPOSED ON IT BY THE GOC.

SUBJECT:  HEIGHTENED FEARS OF \"SECTOR WEST\" SERBS AFTER 
          BEATINGS IN DETENTION CENTERS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SERBS LIVING AROUND PAKRAC, IN SECTOR WEST, ARE 
INCREASINGLY CONCERNED OVER WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS IN STORE 
FOR THEM, ESPECIALLY AFTER HEARING STORIES AND SEEING 
EVIDENCE OF MISTREATMENT OF FELLOW SERBS IN CROATIAN 
DETENTION CENTERS.  DURING A MAY 16 VISIT TO THE AREA, 
SERBS WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN THE VARAZDIN DETENTION CENTER 
TOLD POLOFFS STORIES OF RANDOM BEATINGS AND HARASSMENT. 
DETAINEES WERE REPORTEDLY FORCED TO SIT FOR HOURS IN 
CRAMPED POSITIONS, SING CROATIAN PATRIOTIC SONGS, AND 
ORDERED UP AND DOWN THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT MAKING IT 
IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP.  PEOPLE AVOIDED USING THE TOILET 
FACILITIES FOR FEAR OF BEING BEATEN. 
 
3.  ONE MAN TOLD OF HAVING TO KNEEL WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND 
HIS HEAD AND BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT HIS FAMILY BACKGROUND. 
WHEN, IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION,  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN A 
PARTISAN IN WWII, HE WAS PUNCHED IN THE RIBS.  ANOTHER MAN 
WAS KICKED FOR FAILING TO EAT THE HALF LOAF OF BREAD HE 
WAS GIVEN (HE HAD NO WATER WITH WHICH TO WASH IT DOWN). 
 
4.  BOTH MEN RAISED THEIR SHIRTS TO SHOW THEIR TORSOS, 
ARMS AND LEGS STILL COVERED WITH LARGE BRUISES.  OTHER MEN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01909  01 OF 02  171640Z 
WE SPOKE WITH CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN BEATEN, BUT TO A FAR 
LESSER DEGREE.  SEVERAL OTHERS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY HAD 
NOT BEEN BEATEN AT ALL.  THE BEATINGS APPEARED TO HAVE 
FOLLOWED NO PATTERN AND WERE SOLELY TO INTIMIDATE. 
 
5.  THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT AMONG THOSE WITH WHOM WE 
SPOKE THAT THE TREATMENT DETAINEES IN BJELOVAR HAD BEEN 
\"CORRECT.\"  HOWEVER, THEY TOLD US THAT THERE HAD BEEN 
SEVERE BEATINGS AND MISTREATMENT OF PRISONERS ON ONE OF 
THE TWO BUSES WHICH HAD BROUGHT PRISONERS BACK TO PAKRAC 
FROM BJELOVAR EARLY THAT MORNING.  WE WERE UNABLE TO SPEAK 
TO ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN DETAILS OR CONFIRM 
THE STORY. 
 
6.  SERB LEADER VELJKO DZAKULA TOLD US HE BELIEVED THAT, 
\"IF IT WERE NOT FOR VARAZDIN,\" MANY OF THE SERBS REMAINING 
IN \"SECTOR WEST\" WOULD BE INCLINED TO STAY IN CROATIA.  HE 
HAD BEEN TRYING TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO STAY BUT NOW WAS 
BEGINNING TO THINK THAT \"THE CROATS DO NOT WANT THE SERBS 
TO REMAIN.\"  HE FELT THAT A GUARANTEE THAT A SIZEABLE UN 
FORCE (PREFERABLY ONE INCLUDING AMERICANS) WOULD REMAIN IN 
AREA WAS KEY. 
 
7.  EXCEPT FOR DZAKULA, NONE OF THE DOZEN OR SO SERBS WITH 
WHOM WE SPOKE WAS INCLINED TO STAY BEHIND.  IN MANY CASES, 
THEY HELD BACK ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAD RELATIVES WHO WERE 
STILL MISSING AND WERE UNCERTAIN OF WHAT PROPERTY THEY 
WOULD BE ALLOWED TO TAKE WITH THEM.  A FARMER FROM PAKRAC 
WHO HAD LOST ALL OF HIS STOCK AND FARM BUILDINGS DURING 
THE 1991 WAR SAID HE AND HIS FAMILY WOULD BE PREPARED TO 
LEAVE CROATIA IMMEDIATELY IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD TAKE HIS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

TRACTOR (WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN PROPERLY REGISTERED) WITH 
HIM. 
 
8.  A YOUNG MAN, WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN VARAZDIN BUT NOT 
BEATEN, DESCRIBED WHAT HE FELT WERE EXTREMELY BLEAK CAREER 
PROSPECTS IN CROATIA FOR PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF (HE HAD 
RECEIVED TECHNICAL SCHOOL TRAINING IN ELECTROMECHANICS). 
ONE OF THE MEN SEVERELY BEATEN IN VARAZDIN WAS STILL 
WAITING FOR WORD OF HIS SON WHO HAD YET TO BE RELEASED. 
PEOPLE HAD LIVED IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE SECTOR BEFORE 
THE 1991 WAR SAW NO POINT IN RETURNING TO HOMES THAT WERE 
NOW RUBBLE AND AN UNCERTAIN RECEPTION FROM THEIR FORMER 
NEIGHBORS. 
 
9.  COMMENT:  WE ARE INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE BEATINGS 
AND MISTREATMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE CARRIED OUT 
INDEPENDENTLY AND IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE WISHES AND 
INSTRUCTIONS OF THE GOC.  NEVERTHELESS, THEY GIVE SERIOUS 
CAUSE FOR CONCERN, ESPECIALLY FOR THE WELFARE OF DETAINEES 
WHOSE WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN AND WHOM THE CROATS MAY 
SUSPECT OF HAVING COMMITTED WAR CRIMES.  FROM OUR 
CONVERSATIONS, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GOC WILL HAVE TO DO 
MORE THAN JUST PROMISE SECURITY AND EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER

1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
--------------------------------- 
MARTIC STILL BOASTFUL, AGGRESSIVE 
--------------------------------- 
- 
2.  WHILE WE HAVE HAD NO DIRECT CONTACT WITH \"RSK 
PRESIDENT\" MILAN MARTIC SINCE THE EVENTS OF MAY 1-3, 
UNSRSG AKASHI, WHO MET HIM ON MAY 16, REPORTED TO THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT MARTIC\'S MOOD REMAINS \"BAD,\" AND THAT 
HE IS \"OBSESSED\" WITH SITUATION IN WESTERN SLAVONIA AND 
THE QUESTION OF \"NORMALIZATION\" THERE. 
 
3.  BY MOST OTHER ACCOUNTS, TOO, THE BELLIGERENT MOOD 
MARTIC EXHIBITED IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAY 1 IS ESSENTIALLY 
UNCHANGED.  THREE WESTERN JOURNALISTS WHO WERE 
IN/AROUND KNIN MAY 13-14 ALL TOLD PAO THEY FOUND MARTIC 
TO BE SEEMINGLY \"CONFIDENT\" AND MAINTAINING HIS 
BLUSTER, EVIDENTLY UNCHASTENED BY THE CROATIAN SUCCESS 
IN RECAPTURING WESTERN SLAVONIA.  ONE OF THEM ALSO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01926  01 OF 02  181438Z 
THOUGHT THAT MARTIC\'S POPULAR SUPPORT, EVEN AMONG THE 
EDUCATED ELITE, HAD GROWN AS A RESULT OF THE CROATIAN 
ACTION MAY 1.  EVEN MODERATES IN THE \"RSK,\" THE 
JOURNALIST SAID, HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT THE CROATS 
CANNOT BE TRUSTED, AND THEY \"ARE ANGRY THAT MIKELIC 
BLAMED THE WHOLE MESS ON MARTIC.\" 
 
4.  COUNTERBALANCING THIS LATTER ASSERTION, HOWEVER, 
ARE REPORTS THAT MARTIC\'S FAILURE TO \"SAVE\" SECTOR WEST 
HAS WEAKENED HIS SUPPORT, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE RANK- 
AND-FILE \"RSK\" MILITARY.  ONE TV BROADCOAST REPORTEDLY 
SHOWED MARTIC BLUSTERING BEFORE \"RSK\" MILITARY UNITS 
AND BEING ANSWERED WITH SARCASTIC JEERS. 
 
5.  THERE ARE ALSO OTHER INDICATIONS THAT MARTIC\'S 
POSITION IS LESS FIRM THAN IT WAS.  UN DEPUTY CIVIL 
AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR SECTOR SOUTH, SAIJIN ZHANG, 
INDICATED HE THOUGHT RENEWED MILITARY ACTION BY THE 
KRAJINA SERBS WAS UNLIKELY LARGELY BECAUSE THE \"RSK\" 
LEADERSHIP WOULD BE \"VERY BUSY INTERNALLY\" FOR AT LEAST 
A WHILE.  BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE ON LEAVE MAY 14, ZHANG\'S 
BOSS, JURIJ MIAKOTNYKH, WHOM WE CONSIDER GENERALLY A 
MORE INFORMED SOURCE, TOLD A UN COLLEAGUE THAT HE DID 
NOT FORESEE MARTIC\'S TAKING ANY NEW STEPS WITHIN \"THE 
NEXT TWO WEEKS\" BUT THAT SOME \"MONSTROUS\" ALTERNATIVES 
WERE UNDER CONSIDERATION.  (COMMENT: AT THIS STAGE WE 
BELIEVE THIS TELLS US MORE ABOUT MARTIC\'S STATE OF MIND 
THAN ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC ACTIONS HE MAY TAKE, ESPECIALLY 
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OUR COMMENTS BELOW.)

CELEKETIC RESIGNATION 
--------------------- 
 
6.  THE MAY 14 RESIGNATION OF THE \"RSK\" FORCE COMMANDER 
CELEKETIC, A HARDLINER WHO WAS A CLOSE POLITICAL ALLY 
OF MARTIC, ALSO SUGGESTS THAT MARTIC IS WEAKENED, 
POSSIBLY VIS-A-VIS HIS DOMESTIC POLITICAL RIVALS AS A 
RESULT OF HIS FAILURE TO DEFEND \"RSK\" TERRITORY IN 
SECTOR WEST, AND ALMOST CERTAINLY VIS-A-VIS MILOSEVIC. 
CELEKETIC\'S SUCCESSOR, GENERAL MILE MRKSIC (PRON: MURK- 
SHEETCH), IS A MILOSEVIC CHOICE WHO COMES TO HIS NEW 
POSITION FROM THE JNA STAFF IN BELGRADE.  THE CHANGE 
GIVES MILOSEVIC A VETO OVER MARTIC\'S MILITARY 
ADVENTURISM.  FURTHER, MRKSIC MAY OR MAY NOT PROVE TO 
BE AS CLOSE A WORKING PARTNER FOR MARTIC AS CELEKETIC, 
SO HIS APPOINTMENT TO SOME DEGREE REDUCES MARTIC\'S 
ABILITY TO CARRY THE DAY IN THE \"RSK\'S\" SENIOR 
POLICYMAKING COUNCILS.  EVEN IF SACRIFICING CELEKETIC 
WAS, AS ZHANG BELIEVES, \"THE PRICE MARTIC HAD TO PAY TO 
STAY,\" THIS TOO INDICATES THAT MARTIC WAS UNDER 
PRESSURE.

2.  ON MAY 17/18, LEADING OPPOSITION FIGURES EXPRESSED TO 
AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH THEIR VIEW THAT THE DEPARTURE OF 
ETHNIC SERBS FROM WESTERN SLAVONIA WAS EQUIVALENT TO 
ETHNIC CLEANSING AND A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY IN CROATIA. 
MESIC COMPLAINED THAT OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD NOT BEEN 
INFORMED ABOUT EVENTS IN WESTERN SLAVONIA.  ONE PARTY 
CHARGED THAT DEFMIN SUSAK, AMONG OTHERS, WAS IMPLICATED IN 
WAR CRIMES.  THE ALWAYS POLEMICAL SERB PARTY CHARGED THE 
U.S. WITH COMPLICITY IN THE GOC\'S \"ETHNIC CLEANSING\"; THE 
AMBASSADOR VIGOROUSLY REJECTED THESE CHARGES, NOTING OUR 
PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT GOC HUMAN RIGHTS 
PERFORMANCE.  END SUMMARY.

OPPOSITION IN THE DARK ABOUT THE SITUATION IN FORMER 
SECTOR WEST AND EQUATED THE EXODUS OF SERBS WITH ETHNIC 
CLEANSING.  HE SAID THAT IF THE DEPARTURE OF SERBS

PARTY REPRESENTATIVES WERE NOT ALLOWED INTO THE AREA UNTIL 
TWO DAYS AFTER MILITARY OPERATIONS HAD ENDED, AND WAS 
DOUBTFUL THAT A VISIT NOW WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL 
IMPACT. 
 
4.  ON MAY 18, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH MILAN DJUKIC AND 
VESELIN PEJNOVIC, PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE 
SERBIAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY.  DJUKIC, TYPICALLY POLEMICAL, SAID 
THAT THE GOC\'S MODEL OF PEACEFUL REINTEGRATION WAS 
BECOMING A MODEL OF CROATIA WITHOUT SERBS.  SERBS FROM 
EASTERN SLAVONIA HAD NO INCENTIVE TO THINK ABOUT RETURNING 
TO WESTERN SLAVONIA AT A TIME WHEN SERBS WERE LEAVING FOR 
BOSNIA.  DJUKIC CHARGED THAT THE GOC WAS COMMITTING ETHNIC 
CLEANSING IN FORMER SECTOR WEST AND HAD SYSTEMATICALLY 
DAMAGED ORTHODOX CHURCHES AND SERB HOMES.  SPECIFICALLY HE 
NOTED THAT THE HOUSE OF THE PARISH PRIEST IN JASENOVAC WAS 
OCCUPIED BY THE HV.  HE ALSO SAID THAT WHILE VISITING 
JASENOVAC, HE PERSONALLY OBSERVED TROOPS LOOTING THE HOUSE 
IN WHICH HIS WIFE WAS BORN.  OTHER VILLAGES HE CLAIMED 
WERE THE SITES OF WAR CRIMES WERE: PAKLENICA, LUDEVAC, 
RAICI, COVAC, MLAKA, STARA GRADISKA, AND BOROVAC.  DJUKIC 
AND PEJNOVIC ACCUSED THE USG OF TACITLY SUPPORTING ETHNIC 
CLEANSING THROUGH ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOC. 
 
5.  DJUKIC AND PEJNOVIC ALSO ASKED, IF THE GOC FIGURE OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

350-450 SERB DEAD WAS CORRECT, WHERE THE BODIES WERE. 
THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF PRISONERS HELD AT 
POZEGA AND VARAZDIN.  DJUKIC SAID THAT HV TROOPS 
THREATENED TO BURN ALIVE ONE WOMAN IN THE VILLAGE OF 
SEOVICA, WHO THEN ATTEMPTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE; WHILE 
ANOTHER SERB IN THE VILLAGE REPORTEDLY HANGED HIMSELF 
AFTER BEING INTIMIDATED.  DJUKIC AND PEJNOVIC ALSO CLAIMED 
THAT SERBS WERE BEING FORCED TO SELL THEIR HOMES AND 
LIVESTOCK TO CROATS AT A FRACTION OP THEIR VALUE. 
 
6.  THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED TO MESIC THAT IT WOULD BE 
USEFUL FOR OPPOSITION PARTIES TO CONTACT SERB LEADERS, 
SUCH AS VELJKO DZAKULA IN PAKRAC.  MESIC AGREED THAT 
ESTABLISHING A POLITICAL DIALOGUE WITH LOCAL SERB LEADERS 
COULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD CONVINCING PEOPLE WHO WERE 
UNDECIDED ABOUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD STAY OR GO THAT THEY 
HAD A PUTURE IN CROATIA.  THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED THAT 
THIS WAS VITAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY AS WELL AS 
CROATIA\'S INTEGRATION INTO EUROPE.  HE TOLD BOTH POLITICAL 
PARTIES THAT THE U.S. IS NOT INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING 
REINTEGRATION OP AN ETHNICALLY PURE COUNTRY.  HE REPUTED 
DJUKIC\'S ACCUSATION OP USG SUPPORT FOR ETHNIC CLEANSING BY 
POINTING TO STATEMENTS IN THE PUBLIC RECORD WHICH HAD

RAISED SERIOUS U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT GOC HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS DURING AND AFTER THE OPPENSIVE, INCLUDING THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S CRITICISM OP THE GOC\'S DETENTION OF ELDERLY 
RESIDENTS OP OKUCANI.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE U.S. 
OPPOSED THE USE OF PORCE AND CONSIDERED IT A VIOLATION OF 
THE COPENHAGEN AGREEMENT.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE UN 
SHOULD CONTINUE ITS ROLE IN THE SECTOR SO THAT THE SERBS 
WOULD HAVE ASSURANCES OF SAPETY.

CONCERNS ABOUT GOC POLICY ON BOSNIA 
----------------------------------- 
 
7.  MESIC SAID THAT THE OPPOSITION HAD A NUMBER OF 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE GOC\'S POLICIES, NOT ONLY IN WESTERN 
SLAVONIA, BUT ALSO IN BOSNIA.  HE WAS WORRIED THAT TUDJMAN 
WAS STRIKING SOME KIND OP DEAL WITH MILOSEVIC TO PARTITION 
BOSNIA.  THE AMBASSADOR QUOTED AN OP-ED PIECE IN THE 
GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED DAILY NEWSPAPER VECERNJI LIST WHICH 
STATED THE NEED FOR A NEW SERB-CROAT RELATIONSHIP, BUT 
ALSO THE REQUIREMENT THAT BONN AND WASHINGTON CHANGE THEIR 
BOSNIA POLICY IN THE FACE OF GEOPOLITICAL REALITIES.  THE 
AMBASSADOR TOLD MESIC THAT THE USG WOULD NOT CHANGE ITS 
POLICY, BUT MESIC THOUGHT TUDJMAN WAS CONVINCED THAT THE 
WEST WOULD ALLOW THE DIVISION OP BOSNIA BECAUSE IT IS IN 
CROATIA\'S STRATEGIC INTEREST TO TAKE AS MUCH TERRITORY AS 
POSSIBLE. 
 
8.  MESIC WAS ALSO UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE PUTURE OP UNCRO. 
THE OPPOSITION DID NOT HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF WHERE UNCRO

CROATIA MUST COME TO TERMS WITH ITS OWN WAR CRIMINALS

9.  MESIC AND DJUKIC ARGUED THAT CROATIA MUST ACKNOWLEDGE 
ITS OWN WAR CRIMINALS TO DEMONSTRATE ITS CREDIBILITY WITH 
THE SERB POPULATION, BUT SO FAR THE GOC HAD SHOWN NO 
WILLINGNESS TO CONFRONT THE ISSUE.  THEY ASSERTED THAT 
HIGH OFFICIALS HAD ORDERED KILLINGS AND ORGANIZED CAMPS IN 
BOSNIA, BUT HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSE 
TO TUDJMAN.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED SPECIFICALLY WHO ORDERED 
KILLINGS.  MESIC CLAIMED DEFMIN SUSAK WAS IMPLICATED IN 
THE DESTRUCTION OF 32 SERB VILLAGES AFTER MILITARY ACTION 
ENDED IN 1991.  HE AND DJUKIC ALSO CHARGED THAT SINISA 
LINAC, WHO CURRENTLY COMMANDS A UNIT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
GUARD AND WAS FORMERLY SUSAK\'S BODYGUARD, WAS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR MURDERING A SERB FAMILY IN ZAGREB AND ALSO KILLED 
SERBS IN PAKRAC AND GOSPIC.  THEY ALSO CHARGED THAT HV 
LOGISTICS SUPPORTS MERCEP\'S PARAMILITARY ACTIVITIES IN 
BOSNIA.  MESIC ALSO NOTED THAT TUDJMAN BESTOWED HIGH 
MILITARY HONORS ON A BRIGADE NAMED AFTER GENERAL JURE 
BOBAN WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR CRIMES IN WORLD WAR II. 
 
10.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED FOR MESIC\'S IMPRESSIONS OF THE 
GOC\'S COMMEMORATION OF THE BLEIBURG MASSACRE IN 1945. 
MESIC REPLIED THAT WHILE THE MASSACRE WAS A WAR CRIME, IT 
SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT MANY OF THOSE KILLED WERE ALSO 
WAR CRIMINALS RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING DEATH CAMPS, SUCH AS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

VICTIMS NEEDED TO BE DEPOLITICIZED.

COMMENT

11.  WHILE WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE GOC\'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS PERFORMANCE IN WESTERN SLAVONIA, AT LEAST SOME OF 
DJUKIC\'S ACCUSATIONS APPEAR TO BE EXAGGERATIONS.  EMBOFFS 
HAVE VISITED SOME OF THE VILLAGES DJUKIC MENTIONED -- 
PARTICULARLY TWO VISITS TO SEOVICA -- AND HAVE HEARD 
CREDIBLE STORIES OF INTIMIDATION, BUT NONE OF OUR CONTACTS 
MENTIONED ANYTHING AS SERIOUS AS RESIDENTS COMMITTING 
SUICIDE IN RESPONSE TO HV ABUSE.  WE CONTINUE TO VISIT THE 
AREA AND WILL CHECK OTHER VILLAGES THAT DJUKIC MENTIONED 
TO US.  ONE PATTERN THAT SEEMS TO BE EMERGING IS THAT 
RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT EVENTS IN WESTERN SLAVONIA IS 
LACKING.  THE RUMOR MILL THAT IS GUIDING THE DECISION- 
MAKING OF RESIDENTS APPEARS TO EXTEND ZAGREB AS WELL.

SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1.  (C) A RECENT GOVERNMENT REPORT PROVIDED SOME LONG- 
AWAITED STATISTICS ON DETAINEES, KIA, AND CIVILIANS 
FROM THE MAY 1-2 SECTOR WEST BATTLES.  IT APPEARS, 
HOWEVER, STILL TO LEAVE OPEN QUESTIONS FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND FOR THE AREA\'S SERB 
POPULATION.  THE MAIN CASUALTY OF THE GOC\'S INADEQUATE 
AND UNTIMELY EFFORTS TO PROVIDE NUMBERS ON CASUALTIES 
AND REFUGEES IS THUS, IRONICALLY, ITS OWN CREDIBILITY. 
END SUMMARYCOMMENT.

------------------------------- 
GOC ISSUES A STATISTICAL REPORT 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) ON MAY 22, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER KOSTOVIC 
RELEASED A STATEMENT CONTAINING STATISTICAL INFORMATION 
ON PEOPLE IN SECTOR WEST AFFECTED BY THE MAY 1-2 WAR 
THERE.  THE RELEASE OFFERS THE FOLLOWING DATA: 
 
-- A \"CENSUS\" TAKEN APPARENTLY ON MAY 4 SHOWED 2922 
CIVILIANS REMAINING AROUND PAKRAC AND ABOUT 500 TOTAL 
IN OKUCANI, STARA GRADISKA, AND JASENOVAC. 
 
-- BETWEEN MAY 8 AND 19, 1719 PEOPLE LEFT AND WENT TO 
B-H.  6-7000 CIVILIANS WERE ESTIMATED TO HAVE FLED THE 
AREA AHEAD OF THE ADVANCING TROOPS.  OF THE REMAINING 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SERB POPULATION, 675 HAVE BEEN GRANTED CROATIAN 
CITIZENSHIP CERTIFICATES; 1070 HAVE APPLIED FOR SUCH 
CERTIFICATES. 
 
-- 188 BODIES WERE FOUND AFTER THE FIGHTING.  127 OF 
THESE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.  20 IDENTIFIED AS CIVILIANS 
WERE KILLED \"IN CROSSFIRE CAUSED BY PARAMILITARY 
UNITS,\" AS WERE ANOTHER 34 WHO \"ARE ASSUMED POSSIBLY 
NOT TO HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF PARAMILITARY UNITS.\"  THESE 
BODIES WERE BURIED \"IN SEVERAL GRAVES\" BY RELEVANT 
AUTHORITIES; RELATIVES MAY MAKE INDIVIDUAL INQUIRIES TO 
THE CROATIAN RED CROSS. 
 
-- 1494 \"MILITARILY CAPABLE\" MEN WERE PROCESSED IN 
\"RECEPTION CENTERS.\"  917 OF THESE WERE RELEASED 
WITHOUT INITIATION OF INVESTIGATORY PROCESS.  OF THE 
REMAINDER WHO WERE INVESTIGATED, 188 ARE STILL BEING 
HELD IN \"INVESTIGATION CENTERS.\" 
 
------------------------------- 
DATA LEAVES MANY OPEN QUESTIONS 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (LOU) THE GOVERNMENT\'S \"REPORT\" AT LEAST DEFINES 
THE PARAMETERS, BUT IT LEAVES OPEN AS MANY QUESTIONS AS 
IT ANSWERS.  WE NOTE THE FOLLOWING SHORTCOMINGS: 
-- NO FIGURE IS PROVIDED FOR WOUNDED-IN-ACTION. 
 
-- IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MANY CIVILIANS 
REMAIN IN THE AREA, AS THE TOTAL ATTRIBUTED TO A MAY 4 
RED CROSS CENSUS (3422) CANNOT BE SQUARED WITH THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

(APPARENTLY LATER) CUMULATIVE FIGURES FOR THOSE WHO 
LEFT (1719) AND THOSE WHO REMAIN (POSSIBLY 1745). 
 
-- THE FIGURES ON DETAINEES LEAVE AN ADDITIONAL 391 
PERSONS UNACCOUNTED FOR. 
 
4.  (C) IN A CONVERSATION MAY 23 WITH ASSISTANT 
MINISTER OF INTERIOR FOR POLICE JOSKO MORIC, POLOFFS 
(WHO AT THE TIME HAD ONLY PRESS ACCOUNTS OF THE 
\"REPORT\") ASKED MORIC ABOUT THE LAST DISCREPANCY 
ESPECIALLY.  HE CLAIMED THE MATTER WAS PROBABLY UNCLEAR 
\"BECAUSE OF INCOMPLETE MEDIA TRANSCRIPTION\" (COMMENT: 
ON OUR RETURN TO ZAGREB WE FOUND THE PRESS ACCOUNT WAS 
A FULL RENDERING OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S PRESS RELEASE, AND 
NO MORE COMPLETE REPORT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE UN.) 
MORIC SAID THE NUMBER NOT ACCOUNTED FOR REPRESENTED 
PERSONS NOT CHARGED WITH WAR CRIMES BUT OTHER \"NORMAL\" 
CRIMES SUCH AS THEFT.  (COMMENT: IF SO, THIS WOULD 
VIOLATE THE SPIRIT AND LETTER OF THE GOC\'S AGREEMENT 
WITH THE UN.)

REF:  ZAGREB 2007 
 
1.  AN OFFICIAL OF THE UN CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN 
ZAGREB (PROTECT) SAYS THAT CENTER DIRECTOR MAZOWIECKI, 
IN THE WAKE OF HIS CHARGES THAT THERE WERE \"MASS 
GRAVES\" IN PARTS OF SECTOR WEST, HAD TALKS WITH DEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTER KOSTOVIC TO TRY TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE 
REMAINING DISCREPANCIES AND HOLES IN INFORMATION 
PROVIDED BY THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT (REFTEL). 
 
2.  KOSTOVIC REPORTEDLY GAVE THE UNCHR THE FOLLOWING 
DATA ON DETAINEES:  205 PERSONS REMAIN IN DETENTION 
FROM THE SECTOR WEST OPERATION; 186 OF THESE ARE 
SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE WAR CRIMES CHARGES AND THEY ARE 
DISTRIBUTED AMONG FOUR DETENTION CENTERS, IN BJELOVAR, 
POZEGA, OSIJEK, AND SPLIT.  AN ADDITIONAL 19 PERSONS

ARE DESCRIBED AS \"FOREIGN NATIONALS\" BEING CONSIDERED 
AS POWS, AND THEY ARE DETAINED IN SPLIT. 
 
3.  KOSTOVIC SAID THE GOC HAD TURNED OVER A COMPLETE 
LIST OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO THE CROATIAN RED CROSS. 
MAZOWIECKI OBSERVED THAT THE CROATIAN RED CROSS MIGHT 
NOT BE VIEWED BY SERBS AS THE MOST NEUTRAL 
ORGANIZATION.  KOSTOVIC AGREED AND PROMISED TO PROVIDE 
THE DATA ALSO TO ICRC.  THE ICRC HAS CONFIRMED TO THE 
UNCHR THAT IS HAS BOTH A LIST AND/AND ACCESS TO THE 
DETAINED PERSONS. 
 
4.  REGARDING THE CHARGES OF MASS GRAVES, (FYI, WE NOW 
UNDERSTAND MAZOWIECKI\'S PEOPLE OBSERVED, NOT \"MASS 
GRAVES\" AS SUCH BUT ROWS OF NEW GRAVEMOUNDS), KOSTOVIC 
PROVIDED THE UNCHR A LIST OF THE BURIAL SITES WHERE A 
TOTAL OF 188 FATALITIES FROM THE SECTOR WEST OPERATION 
HAD BEEN BURIED.  156 OF THESE HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED; 20 
WERE DEFINITELY CIVILIANS, MOST EVIDENTLY KILLED IN THE 
CROSSFIRE OF A SKIRMISH NEAR NOVI VAROS.  AN ADDITIONAL 
34 WERE \"POSSIBLE\" CIVILIANS -- THOUGHT TO BE CIVILIANS 
ALTHOUGH MANY WERE DRESSED IN UNIFORMS OR PARTIAL 
UNIFORMS.  KOSTOVIC REPEATED THE GOC\'S OFFER TO MAKE 
INFORMATION ON THE IDENTITIES OF THE CIVILIAN DEAD 
AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUAL RELATIVES WHO MIGHT INQUIRE. 
HE SPECIFICALLY REJECTED THE IDEA OF PROVIDING THE 
NAMES OF THE MILITARY DEAD ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE 
\"RSK\" HAD NEVER PROVIDED SIMILAR INFORMATION AFTER THE 
FIGHTING IN EASTERN SLAVONIA (VUKOVAR).

WOUNDED FOUND AFTER THE OPERATION; THEY HAD BEEN

6.  ASKED IF UN OR OTHER AUTHORITIES INTENDED TO PURSUE 
THE ISSUE OF MASS GRAVES OR OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS 
FURTHER, OUR SOURCE THOUGHT THIS RELATIVELY UNLIKELY. 
REGARDING THE GRAVES, FM GRANIC HAD PROMISED WAR CRIMES 
TRIBUNAL CHIEF PROSECUTOR GOLDSTONE DURING THE LATTER\'S 
VISIT HERE THAT CROATIA WOULD COOPERATE WITH ANY 
INVESTIGATION.  IT SEEMED POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE 
TRIBUNAL WOULD FIND INSUFFICIENT CAUSE TO PURSUE THE 
MATTER FURTHER OR TO SEEK EXHUMATION.  OUR CONTACT 
BELIEVED MAZOWIECKI WAS RELATIVELY SATISFIED WITH THE 
EXPLANATIONS GIVEN BY THE GOC.  REGARDING THE OVERBLOWN 
ESTIMATE OF KIAS GIVEN BY DEFMIN SUSAK, HE FELT THERE 
WERE ENOUGH CREDIBLE SOURCES SUGGESTING THAT SUSAK HAD, 
IN EFFECT, BEEN SPEAKING WITHOUT BASIS.  THE UN IN THE 
BANJA LUKA AREA HAD REPORTED \"SEVERAL HUNDRED\" WOUNDED 
AMONG THOSE WHO FLED FROM CROATIAN TO BOSNIAN 
TERRITORY

2. SAKIC RUMOR: (FOR CHRIS HOH FROM RICK HOLTZAPPLE) I 
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH CICAK TO SEE WHAT HE HAS 
HEARD, BUT I ASKED SLAVKO GOLDSTEIN (A MEMBER OF THE 
CROATIAN HELSINKI COMMITTEE\'S BOARD, A CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF 
CICAK, AND A PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE ZAGREB JEWISH 
COMMUNITY) IF HE HAD HEARD ANY RUMORS THAT SAKIC HAD 
SURFACED IN CROATIA.  GOLDSTEIN SAID HE HAD NOT HEARD ANY 
SUCH RUMORS, AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD THEM IF THEY 
WERE CIRCULATING IN ZAGREB.  (NOTE: IF CICAK WERE 
SPREADING THESE RUMORS, GOLDSTEIN WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY 
HAVE HEARD THEM.)

3.  GOLDSTEIN, AND OTHERS I ASKED WHO FOLLOW THE PRESS 
CLOSELY, RECALLED THAT SAKIC GAVE AN INTERVIEW IN BUENOS 
AIRES TO A LOCAL JOURNALIST WHO ACCOMPANIED TUDJMAN ON HIS 
TRIP TO ARGENTINA A FEW MONTHS BACK.  (I GATHER SAKIC IS 
NOT EXACTLY IN HIDING IN ARGENTINA; HE CLAIMS HE HAS 
POWERFUL FRIENDS IN THE ARMY AND LEGISLATURE.)  IN THAT 
INTERVIEW, SAKIC SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO VISIT CROATIA, 
BUT THAT HE KNEW IT WOULD BE AN IMPOLITIC THING TO DO, 
BECAUSE OF HIS PAST.  BUT SAKIC SAID, \"I HOPE THAT THE 
BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR I WILL BE ABLE TO COME AND STAY. 
WE WILL SEE.\"  GOLDSTEIN SAID HE ALSO VAGUELY RECALLED A 
SUBSEQUENT PRESS REPORT OF AN (UNCONFIRMED) COMMENT BY 
CROATIAN HEALTH MINISTER HEBRANG THAT THERE WAS NO REASON 
SAKIC SHOULD NOT TRAVEL TO CROATIA, SINCE HE HAD NEVER 
BEEN CONVICTED OF WAR CRIMES.  BUT GOLDSTEIN SAID THAT 
THIS COMMENT WAS AN UNOFFICIAL STATEMENT, AND HE WAS NOT 
EVEN SURE HEBRANG HAD REALLY SAID IT. (NOTE: HEBRANG\'S 
FATHER, A LEADING PARTISAN, WAS PART OF A PRISONER 
EXCHANGE ORGANIZED BY SAKIC IN WWII.) 
 
4. OUR FBIS FSN ALSO TOLD ME THAT HE THOUGHT TANJUG HAD 
RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SAKIC HAD COME TO ZAGREB.  POSSIBLY 
THAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE RUMOR THAT SAKIC HAS NOW COME TO 
ZAGREB. 
 
5. BY THE WAY, IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE COMMANDANT 
OF JASENOVAC WAS A MAN NAMED MAX LUBURIC (WHOSE SISTER IS 
MARRIED TO SAKIC), AND SAKIC WAS THE CAMP\'S DEPUTY 
COMMANDER (AND CHIEF EXECUTIONER).

          CONFIDENCE-BUILDING AND ENCOURAGING SERB RETURN 
 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  POLOFFS MET WITH VELJKO DZAKULA AT HIS REQUEST JUNE 6. 
HE WANTED TO SUGGEST CONCRETE MEASURES TO BEGIN THE 
SERIOUS REINTEGRATION OF THE REMAINING SERB AND RETURNING 
CROAT COMMUNITIES OF WESTERN SLAVONIA.  DZAKULA ESTIMATED 
THAT BETWEEN 800 TO 1000 SERBS WERE STILL LIVING IN PAKRAC 
COUNTY AND ANOTHER 200 REMAINED IN OKUCANI.  HE EMPHASIZED 
THAT THIS REMAINING SERB POPULATION WAS ATTEMPTING TO 
REORGANIZE THEIR LIVES UNDER A CROAT-CONTROLLED SYSTEM, 
BUT THE CROATIANS HAD SHOWED LITTLE GOODWILL SO FAR TOWARD 
KEEPING THE SERBIAN POPULATION IN THE AREA.  HIGH-LEVEL 
GOC OFFICIALS HAD PROMISED DZAKULA TO WORK TOWARDS 
ENCOURAGING SERBS TO RETURN FROM BOSNIA AND SECTOR EAST, 
HE SAID, BUT LITTLE HAD COME OF THESE TALKS.  THE MINISTRY 
OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS (MUP) WAS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR 
MILITARY-AGE MEN TO GET CITIZENSHIP PAPERS (DOMOVNICA), 
ALTHOUGH WOMEN AND ELDERLY HAD RECEIVED THEM.  DZAKULA HAD 
BEEN OFFERED A DOMOVNICA, BUT REFUSED TO ACCEPT ONE UNTIL 
EVERY SERB IN THE COUNTY RECEIVED HIS.  DAILY CIVIL LIFE 
WAS STILL A PROBLEM.  ABOUT 180 MEN WERE STILL JAILED 
AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR ARMED REBELLION EVEN THOUGH AN 
AMNESTY HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED AND GOC OFFICIALS HAD PROMISED 
TO RELEASE THEM.  EVEN MUNDANE THINGS SUCH AS GATHERING 
WOOD FOR FUEL HAD BECOME A PROBLEM. 
 
3.  DZAKULA IDENTIFIED THREE PRECONDITIONS WHICH WOULD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 

 
 
 
 
 
                           CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02227  01 OF 02  091142Z 
ENCOURAGE THE DISPLACED TO RETURN TO WESTERN SLAVONIA. 
THE AMNESTY DECLARED BY THE GOC HAD TO BE COMPLIED WITH 
AND EVEN BROADENED TO INCLUDE  NOT ONLY ARMED REBELLION, 
BUT ALSO ORGANIZING, SALE OF WEAPONS, AND OTHER SIMILAR 
CHARGES.  ONLY THOSE SERBS AND CROATS CHARGED WITH WAR 
CRIMES SHOULD NOT BE PARDONED.  THE REMAINING PRISONERS IN 
CROAT JAILS HAD TO BE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY IF THERE WERE 
NO PENDING WAR CRIMES CHARGES AGAINST THEM.  SECOND, A 
MORATORIUM MUST BE IMPOSED ON THE DRAFTING AND 
MOBILIZATION INTO THE CROATIAN ARMY OF SERBS FROM WEST 
SLAVONIA.  SERBS DISPLACED TO BANJA LUKA AND ELSEWHERE 
MUST BE MADE TO FEEL THEY WOULD RETURN FROM AN AREA OF WAR 
TO AN AREA OF PEACE IN WESTERN SLAVONIA. 
 
4.  THIRD, THE POLITICAL COMPOSITION OF THE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT NEEDED TO BE WORKED OUT TO BALANCE THE TWO 
POPULATIONS.  THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF SO MANY POLICE TO 
PROTECT THE POPULATION WAS ENCOURAGING BUT THE POLICE 
FORCE NEEDED TO BE REORGANIZED ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL 
CENSUS OF 1991.  WHILE DZAKULA ACKNOWLEDGED THE SMALL 
REMAINING POPULATION OF SERBS IN THE AREA MADE 
REPRESENTATION PROPORTIONAL TO THE 1991 CENSUS FIGURES 
IMPOSSIBLE IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, HE CLAIMED THAT THERE 
WERE SEVERAL QUALIFIED SERBIAN POLICEMEN IN THE REGION WHO 
WISHED TO RETURN TO THEIR PREVIOUS JOBS.  ON JUNE 7, THE 
GOC HAD ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION TO MONITOR 
THE PEACEFUL REINTEGRATION OF THE PAKRAC AND LIPIK 
COMMUNITIES.  THIS COMMITTEE WOULD CONSIST OF FIVE 
MEMBERS, TWO OF WHICH WOULD ALWAYS BE SERBS, INCLUDING THE 
COMMITTEE\'S PRESIDENT.  ALTHOUGH SUPPORTIVE OF CREATING 
JOINT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, DZAKULA INSISTED THAT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 

 
 
 
 
 
                           CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02227  01 OF 02  091142Z 
THE SERBS MUST HAVE A SAY IN THE CREATION OF SUCH 
STRUCTURES, AND NOT HAVE THEM IMPOSED.  HE CRITICIZED THE 
FACT THAT THE GOC-PROPOSED BODY WOULD HAVE A CROAT 
MAJORITY, AND THAT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE ADVISORY DUTIES, 
WITH ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENT ON ACTION BY THE 
OVERWHELMINGLY CROAT COUNTY COUNCIL. 
 
5.  DZAKULA SUGGESTED SEVERAL CONCRETE CONFIDENCE-BUILDING 
MEASURES THAT MI 
GHT CREATE GOODWILL BETWEEN THE LOCAL SERB 
POPULATION AND RETURNING CROATS.  A CONVOY SHOULD BE 
ORGANIZED TO TRANSPORT OVER ONE HUNDRED SERBS DISPLACED IN 
1991 TO SEE THEIR DESTROYED HOMES IN THE NORTHERN, CROAT- 
CONTROLLED AREA OF FORMER SECTOR WEST.  IMMEDIATE CREDITS 
TO REBUILD HOMES NEEDED TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO BOTH 
CROATS AND SERBS IN THE REGION.  SUCH FUNDING OUGHT TO BE 
DONE ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, HE SUGGESTED, SINCE THE 
GOC HAD SUPPLIED NO SUCH CREDITS TO SERBS SO FAR.  A THIRD 
SUGGESTION FOCUSED ON REBUILDING THE ECONOMIC BASIS FOR 
THE LOCAL PEOPLE.  MANY LOCALS IN THIS AGRICULTURAL 
COMMUNITY WHO HAD REMAINED HAD SOLD THEIR LIVESTOCK AND 
FARM EQUIPMENT IN THE PAST MONTH TO CROATS AT EXTREMELY 
LOW PRICES, AND WERE LEFT WITH NO READY SOURCE OF FOOD OR

METHOD TO TILL THEIR LAND IN THESE SUMMER MONTHS.  DZAKULA 
SAID THAT SUCH FAMILIES SHOULD BE GIVEN THE CONFISCATED 
ANIMALS OF SERBS WHO HAD LEFT THE REGION (UNTIL THE LATTER 
GROUP RETURNED) AND SHOULD BE SOLD BACK THEIR EQUIPMENT TO 
CONTINUE THEIR LIVELIHOODS. 
 
6.  THE CROATS MUST NOT WAIT FOR THE OTHER THREE SECTORS 
TO BE REINTEGRATED TO SOLVE THE \"SERBIAN PROBLEM.\"  THAT 
PROCESS MUST BE STARTED NOW, INSISTED DZAKULA.  LOCAL 
SERBS BELIEVE THERE IS AN EXTREME RESISTANCE ON THE PART 
OF THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT TO COOPERATION WITH THE SERB 
POPULATION.  THE REMAINING SERBS WERE QUICKLY LOSING FAITH 
AND THEIR WILL TO STAY.  GROUPS SUCH AS \"THE ASSOCIATION 
FOR CROATIAN REFUGEES\" MUST BE RENAMED AND BEGIN WORK TO 
RETURN ALL REFUGEES IN CROATIA, INCLUDING SERBS, CROATS 
AND OTHERS.  THERE WERE 14,000 DISPLACED CROATS FROM THE 
AREA, BUT 75,000 DISPLACED SERBS, HE SAID.  (NOTE: THE 
75,000 FIGURE IS FOR SERBS DISPLACED IN 1991 AND SINCE.) 
THE GOC MUST BEGIN TO SHOW IT WAS INTERESTED IN SOLVING 
THE PROBLEMS OF ALL THESE PEOPLE.  ONLY THEN WOULD THE 
FLEEING SERB POPULATION BEGIN TO RETURN.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  IN AN APRIL 12 MEETING, CROATIA\'S CARDINAL KUHARIC 
APPEALED TO THE AMBASSADOR FOR HELP FOR PERSECUTED 
MINORITIES IN THE BANJA LUKA REGION.  DISCUSSING THE 
SITUATION IN CROATIA, THE CARDINAL ADVOCATED \"EQUALITY\" 
FOR THE SERBIAN POPULATION BUT WAS UNABLE TO COMPREHEND 
WHY SERBS MIGHT NOT ALWAYS FEEL THEY ARE TREATED \"EQUALLY\" 
IN CROATIA.  BIO NOTE:  KUHARIC TURNED 75 ON APRIL 15, 
1995 AND, ACCORDING TO CANON LAW, SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO 
AUTOMATIC RETIREMENT.  HOWEVER, IT APPEARS THAT THE POPE 
WANTS HIM TO STAY ON, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.  THERE 
ARE NO CLEAR FAVORITES TO SUCCEED HIM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
LAST CHANCE TO HALT ETHNIC CLEANSING IN NORTHERN BOSNIA 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3.  ON APRIL 12 THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH FRANJO CARDINAL 
KUHARIC WHO MADE AN APPEAL ON BEHALF OF THE LONG-SUFFERING 
MINORITIES IN BANJA LUKA, NOW UNDER EVEN GREATER PRESSURE 
AS A RESULT OF CROATIA HAVING RETAKEN SECTOR WEST AND 
OTHER MILITARY REVERSES SUFFERED BY THE SERBS.  THE 
CARDINAL ESTIMATED THAT IN THE NORTHERN BOSNIA AREA THERE 
ONLY REMAIN 30,000 MUSLIMS AND 20,000 CROATS \"SLEEPING IN 
THE WOODS\" (FROM A PRE-WAR POPULATION OP 356,000 MUSLIMS 
AND 181,000 CROATS).  HE SOUGHT A CLEARLY WORDED STATEMENT 
PROM THE WEST TO PUT THE SERBS ON NOTICE THAT ETHNIC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02326  01 OF 03  161531Z 
CLEANSING MUST CEASE IMMEDIATELY. 
 
4.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED SYMPATHY POR THE CARDINAL\'S 
CONCERNS BUT QUESTIONED WHETHER MORE WORDS WOULD MAKE ANY 
DIPFERENCE.  HE NOTED THAT THE WORLD HAD ALREADY MADE 
CLEAR TO THE SERB AUTHORITIES THAT THEY WOULD BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN BANJA LUKA AND ELSEWHERE. 
HE CITED THE WORK OF THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL 
AND THE EFFORTS BY THE USG TO COLLECT EVIDENCE OP WAR 
CRIMES AND ATROCITIES.  YET IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE SERBS 
ONLY UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF PORCE. 
 
5.  ASKED IP HE SAW ANY CHANCE THAT THE SERBIAN ORTHODOX 
CHURCH MIGHT PLAY A ROLE IN BRINGING ABOUT A PEACE 
SETTLEMENT, KUHARIC REPLIED THAT SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH 
WAS A NATIONAL CHURCH.  ALTHOUGH THERE EXISTS MORE THAN 
ONE CURRENT, AND SOME MODERATES ARE INCLINED TOWARD A JUST 
SOLUTION, THE LEADERSHIP VIEWS THE WAR AS A \"FIGHT AGAINST 
ISLAM IN EUROPE AND CATHOLICISM IN THE BALKANS.\"  THEY 
EMBRACE THE RIGHT OF ALL SERRS TO LIVE IN ONE STATE AND AS 
SUCH ARE ALIGNED WITH THE MORE RADICAL POLITICAL ELEMENTS 
SUCH AS KARADZIC. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
CARDINAL STILL FIGHTING OLD BATTLES TO \"CORRECT\" HISTORY 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
6.  TURNING TO CROATIA, THE AMBASSADOR OPINED THAT A PEACE 
PROCESS WAS POSSIBLE BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE CROATS TO 
RETHINK HOW THEY VIEW SERBS.  REPEATED REFERENCES TO SERBS 
AS A \"MINORITY\" MAKE THEM FEEL UNWELCOME AND INFERIOR.

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02326  01 OF 03  161531Z 
 
7.  KUHARIC REPLIED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE SERBS HAVE ALWAYS 
BEEN A MINORITY IN CROATIA, THEY FORMERLY FUNCTIONED AS A 
MAJORITY.  AFTER RULING FOR 75 YEARS THEY DO NOT WANT TO 
ACCEPT MERE \"EQUALITY.\"  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SERBS ARE LAID 
OFF FROM A JOB THEY CLAIM DISCRIMINATION, IGNORING THE 
FACT THAT THOUSANDS OF CROATS ARE LAID OFF AS WELL. 
KUHARIC THEN RECITED THE FAMILIAR LITANY OF SERB ABUSES 
AGAINST THE CROATIAN PEOPLE BEGINNING IN 1918 WHEN A GROUP 
OF CROATS PROTESTING THE CREATION OF YUGOSLAVIA WERE FIRED 
UPON IN ZAGREB\'S MAIN SQUARE AND ENDING WITH THE JNA 
ARMING THE LOCAL MILITIAS IN 1991.  HE ARGUED THAT \"THOSE 
WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FREE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY 
OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SLAVES.\" 
 
8.  THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED THAT A SERB MIGHT RECITE A 
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT HISTORY OF YUGOSLAVIA, FOCUSSING MORE 
ON THE WWII NDH GOVERNMENT AND THE JASENOVAC CONCENTRATION 
CAMP. 
 
9.  THIS COMMENT LED THE CARDINAL TO DECLARE THAT, WHILE 
\"IT WOULD BE A CRIME IF JUST ONE MAN WAS KILLED AT 
JASENOVAC,\" THE CHARGE THAT 700,000 WERE SLAUGHTERED COULD

CROATIA.  HE CITED NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF WWII ATROCITIES 
COMMITTED AGAINST CROATS.  HE EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO 
\"PITY OVER EVERY TOMB\" BUT REFUSED TO ACCEPT \"HALF A 
CENTURY OF UNJUST PROPAGANDA AND LIES.\"  HE INSISTED THAT 
ONE CANNOT CONDEMN AN ENTIRE NATION FOR CRIMES COMMITTED 
BY ITS LEADERS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
PRINCIPLES CLEAR BUT RECONCILIATION WILL BE LONG 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
10.  THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT WAS PRECISELY THE POINT. 
IF PEOPLE INSIST ON FIGHTING THE BATTLES OF THE PAST THERE 
CAN BE NO FUTURE.  CROATIA, AS A NEW, INDEPENDENT STATE, 
CAN AFFORD TO BE GENEROUS TO THE SERBS WHO LIVE HERE. 
SUCH A POLICY IS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO, IT ALSO 
MAKES SENSE IN THE QUEST FOR PEACE. 
 
11.  THE CARDINAL RESPONDED SAYING THE SERBS DO NOT WANT 
PEACE AND THAT IS WHY THEY STARTED THE WAR.  THE 
AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT IN 1991 IT WAS NOT THE SERBIAN 
PEOPLE BUT THE YUGOSLAV NATIONAL ARMY AND CERTAIN LEADERS 
IN KNIN WHO CHOSE TO FIGHT AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT CROATIA. 
THE MAJORITY OF SERBS CHOSE TO REMAIN IN CROATIA AND NOW 
THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CONVINCE THESE PEOPLE TO 
ACCEPT REALITY AND MAKE THEM FEEL WELCOME. 
 
12.  THE CARDINAL EXPRESSED HIS AGREEMENT SAYING THAT THE 
PRINCIPLES ARE CLEAR BUT THE PROCESS WILL BE LONG AND 
HARD.  ONE MUST UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE VICTIMS, 
THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT A SERB AFTER HE HAS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

TOWARD THE CRIMINAL, NOT TOWARD ALL SERBS.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
13.  KUHARIC IS CLEARLY WELL-INTENTIONED AND HAS TRIED TO 
PUT INTO PRACTICE THE TOLERANCE THAT HE PREACHES.  ON 
NUMEROUS OCCASIONS HE HAS REACHED OUT TO CROATIA\'S OTHER 
RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES.  DURING THE WAR IN 1991 HE VISITED 
AN ORTHODOX CHURCH NEAR THE FRONTLINES AND SPOKE OUT 
AGAINST ANY ATTEMPTS TO TAKE REVENGE ON CROATIA\'S ORTHODOX 
COMMUNITY.  HE HAS STEADFASTLY SUPPORTED A UNITED BOSNIA 
AND CAME UNDER STRONG CRITICISM IN OFFICIAL CIRCLES AND 
EVEN AMONG HIS OWN CLERGY WHEN HE PROTESTED CRIMES 
COMMITTED AGAINST MUSLIMS DURING THE CROAT-MUSLIM CONFLICT 
IN B-H.  FORMER \"HERCEG-BOSNA PRESIDENT\" MATE BOBAN WROTE 
AN OPEN LETTER ACCUSING KUHARIC OF \"BETRAYING THE 
INTERESTS OF THE CROATIAN PEOPLE.\" 
 
14.  BUT, LIKE SO MANY CROATS (ESPECIALLY OF HIS 
GENERATION), HE APPEARS UNABLE TO SHAKE THE DUST OF 
HISTORY OFF HIS FEET AND GIVE UP THE OLD BATTLES OF WHO 
DID WHAT TO WHOM AND WHEN.  ALSO, LIKE MOST CROATS, HE IS 
UNABLE TO PUT HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF OTHERS AND SEE WHAT 
DAILY LIFE AND ECONOMIC PROSPECTS MUST LOOK LIKE TO THE 
AVERAGE SERB LIVING IN CROATIA.  ISOLATED BECAUSE OF HIS 
POSITION, HE FINDS IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SERBS ARE NOT 
ALWAYS TREATED \"EQUALLY\" IN CROATIAN SOCIETY.  SO, WHILE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 

 
 
 
 
 
                           CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02326  02 OF 03  161532Z 
HE CAN PROBABLY BE COUNTED ON TO SPEAK UP IN THE FACE OF 
BLATANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, HE IS NOT LIKELY TO PLAY 
A FORCEFUL LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF NATIONAL 
RECONCILIATION.

BIO NOTE 
-------- 
 
15.  FRANJO CARDINAL KUHARIC TURNED 75 ON APRIL 15, 1994 
AND, ACCORDING TO CANON LAW, SHOULD BE FACING MANDATORY 
RETIREMENT.  HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGN THAT THE 
CARDINAL IS ABOUT TO STEP DOWN NOR HAS A COADJUTOR BEEN 
NAMED.  GIVEN THAT NOTHING WAS SAID ON THE SUBJECT DURING 
THE VISIT OF POPE JOHN PAUL II TO ZAGREB LAST SEPTEMBER, 
IT IS GENERALLY FELT THAT THE CARDINAL WILL BE ALLOWED TO 
REMAIN ON FOR AT LEAST A FEW MORE YEARS. 
- 
 
16.  THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OPEN SPECULATION OVER KUHARIC\'S 
POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS.  THOSE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED ARE 
HIS SECRETARY, STJEPAN KOZUL; ZAGREB\'S ASSISTANT BISHOPS

DIRECTOR MONSIGNOR VLADIMIR STANKOVIC AND SARAJEVO 
ARCHBISHOP VINKO PULJIC PRIOR TO HIS BEING MADE A CARDINAL 
IN HIS OWN RIGHT IN NOVEMRER OF LAST YEAR.  ALL ARE 
RELATIVELY YOUNG (LATE 40\'S EARLY 50\'S) EXCEPT BADURINA 
WHO IS ALSO SAID TO BE IN POOR HEALTH. 
 
17.  KUHARIC APPEARS TO ENJOY EXCELLENT HEALTH AND IS 
THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE THE RIGHT PERSON TO GUIDE THE 
REGION\'S CATHOLIC POPULATION THROUGH THESE TROUBLED TIMES. 
THE CARDINAL IS VALUED AS A MEDIATOR.  HE HAS KEPT HIS 
LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH.  IN 
MAY OF 1994 KUHARIC MET IN SARAJEVO WITH SERBIAN ORTHODOX 
PATRIARCH PAVLE AND RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH ALEKSEJ II. 
TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN HE MET WITH JOVAN PAVLOVIC, 
METROPOLITAN FOR CROATIA, SLOVENIA AND ITALY (RESIDENT IN 
LJUBLJANA).  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR LEFT HIS OFFICE, VELJKO 
KNEZEVIC, THE HEAD OF THE FRY\'S LIAISON OFFICE IN ZAGREB 
WAS WAITING IN THE ANTEROOM. 
 
18.  AFTER THROWING THE CHURCH\'S UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT 
BEHIND THE HDZ DURING CROATIA\'S STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE, 
KUHARIC WAS QUICK TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM TUDJMAN AND THE 
OFFICIAL PARTY AFTERWARDS.  HE HAS OPENLY OPPOSED THE IDEA 
OF CROATIAN STATE IN WHICH CROATS WOULD HAVE GREATER 
RIGHTS THAN OTHER NATIONALITIES.  IN AUGUST OF 1993, AFTER 
THE FEAST OF THE ASSUMPTION ON WHICH TUDJMAN DELIVERED A 
POLITICAL ADDRESS IN A DALMATIAN CHURCH, THE CARDINAL 
STRICTLY FORBID THAT ANY POLITICIAN BE PERMITTED SPEAK ON 
CHURCH PREMISES.  HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH TUDJMAN HAS BEEN 
COOL.  A TUDJMAN AIDE REPORTEDLY ASKED ONCE, \"WHY DOESN\'T 
THE CARDINAL INVITE THE PRESIDENT IN FOR A COFFEE WHEN HE

THE CENTER HAS COMPILED LISTS OF MISSING PERSONS, 
INCLUDING DATES AND LOCATION OF CAPTURE, AND HAS SUBMITTED 
THE DATA TO THE UN CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN GENEVA. 
FARKAS SAID, HOWEVER, THAT SO FAR THEIR APPEALS TO THE UN 
FOR ASSISTANCE HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED.  FARKAS\' GROUP HAS 
ALSO SENT AN APPEAL TO SERBIAN PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC 
REQUESTING THAT FRY AUTHORITIES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON 
WHETHER INDIVIDUALS ARE ALIVE OR DEAD.  THE AMBASSADOR 
STRESSED THAT THERE IS LITTLE THE EMBASSY CAN DO BEYOND 
PROVIDING MORAL SUPPORT, BUT SAID THAT WE ARE STILL 
WORKING FOR UN ACCESS TO SUSPECTED MASS GRAVE SITES IN 
SECTOR EAST AND CONTINUE TO PRESS AUTHORITIES IN KNIN FOR 
INFORMATION.  HE SAID THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT OFFICIALS 
IN SECTOR EAST OR BELGRADE WOULD COME FORWARD WITH AN 
ACCOUNTING OF THE MISSING BECAUSE THEY WOULD IMPLICATE 
THEMSELVES IN WAR CRIMES. 
 
3.  FOR USUN: POST REQUESTS THAT USUN CONSIDER RAISING THE 
ISSUE OF THE MISSING IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA AND 
HERCEGOVINA, PERHAPS IN A UNSC PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT. 
THIS WOULD FOCUS ATTENTION ON A COMPELLING HUMANITARIAN 
PROBLEM AND BE OF COMFORT TO FAMILIES WHO FEEL THEIR 
CONCERNS ARE FORGOTTEN.  IT WOULD ALSO KEEP ATTENTION 
FOCUSED ON WAR CRIMES, WITH SOME PRESUMED DETERRENT 
BENEFIT.

2. TWO DAYS AFTER THE PRESIDENT\'S CHIEF OF STAFF, HRVOJE 
SARINIC, TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE GOC HAD (ALMOST) \"NO 
PRECONDITIONS\" FOR TALKS WITH THE KRAJINA SERBS, PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN PUBLICLY LAID OUT SIX CONDITIONS FOR CROATIAN 
PARTICIPATION.  SARINIC COMPLAINED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY\'S FOCUS ON GAINING RECOGNITION OF BOSNIAN 
HERZEGOVINA WAS POINTLESS, AND CREATED A \"DANGEROUS\" 
SITUATION IN CROATIA.  AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH URGED THE GOC 
TO OPEN A \"SECOND TRACK\" OF NEGOTIATIONS:  TO HOLD TALKS 
WITH SERBS FROM GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED TERRITORY ON HOW TO 
IMPROVE THE OVERALL STATUS OF SERBS IN CROATIA.  END

SARINIC: GOC WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH KRAJINA SERBS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3. AT LUNCH ON JUNE 30, PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF HRVOJE 
SARINIC TOLD AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH THAT THE GOC WAS WILLING 
TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE KNIN SERBS.  SARINIC, 
SAYING HE WAS REPEATING A STATEMENT HE MADE TO UN SRSG 
AKASHI, SAID \"THE ONLY PRECONDITION IS THAT THERE BE NO 
PRECONDITIONS.\"  HE NOTED IN PARTICULAR THAT SERB 
PRECONDITIONS, SUCH AS A CROATIAN WITHDRAWAL FROM MOUNT 
DINARA IN SECTOR SOUTH, WERE NOT CONSTRUCTIVE.  NOTING 
THAT THE EU AMBASSADORS HAD PRESENTED A DEMARCHE URGING 
WITHDRAWAL FROM MOUNT DINARA, SARINIC SAID THE GOC OFFERED 
\"NO APOLOGIES\" FOR THE SITUATION:  FOR A LONG TIME, THE 
SITUATION FOR CROATIA HAD BEEN \"VERY BAD,\" NOW IT WAS ONLY 
CROATIAN MILITARY STEPS WHICH HAD MADE THINGS \"A BIT 
BETTER.\" 
 
4. SARINIC HEDGED THE GOC\'S LACK OF PRECONDITIONS ON 
NEGOTIATIONS.  THE GOC \"OBVIOUSLY\" WAS NOT PREPARED TO 
NEGOTIATE WITH \"RSK PRESIDENT\" MARTIC.  SARINIC ALSO 
CLAIMED THE GOC WAS STILL WILLING TO MEET IN GENEVA, BUT 
THAT THIS \"FLEXIBILITY\" WOULD \"NOT LAST LONG.\"  TUDJMAN 
WAS AGAINST HOLDING THE MEETING IN GENEVA, AND \"SOON\" THE 
GOC WOULD RETURN TO ITS INSISTENCE THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS 
BE HELD IN CROATIA.

ON JULY 2, PRESIDENT TUDJMAN TOLD ICFY CO-CHAIRMEN BILDT 
AND STOLTENBERG THAT CROATIA WOULD SEEK PRECONDITIONS TO 
ANY NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE KNIN SERBS.  UNDER THE HEADLINE 
\"THREE PRECONDITIONS FOR TALKS\" THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
DAILY \"VJESNIK\" REPORTED SIX (BY OUR COUNT) CONDITIONS: 1) 
THAT MILAN MARTIC NOT PARTICIPATE, AS HE WAS A \"WAR 
CRIMINAL\" WHO ORDERED THE MAY 2-3 SHELLING OF ZAGREB; 2) 
THAT THE TALKS BE HELD \"ON THE TERRITORY OF CROATIA;\" 3) 
THAT ANY POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WHICH MIGHT TAKE PLACE 
MUST \"SUBMIT TO THE SPIRIT OF THE CROATIAN CONSTITUTIONAL 
ACT ON MINORITIES AND ETHNIC COMMUNITIES;\" 4) THE RIJEKA- 
SISAK OIL PIPELINE BE REOPENED, AS AGREED IN THE DECEMBER 
1994 ECONOMIC AND CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES AGREEMENT 
(ECBMA); 5) THE EU ASSIST IN OPENING OF THE ZAGREB-KNIN- 
SPLIT RAILWAY; AND 6) THE UNCRO MANDATE BE IMPLEMENTED \"A 
S 
ENVISAGED IN THE UN RESOLUTIONS.\"  (NOTE:  THE PRESS 
RELEASE FROM TUDJMAN\'S OFFICE SOUGHT TO PORTRAY ONLY THE

MILOSEVIC HAD \"GOOD RELATIONS\" WITH \"RSK PRIME MINISTER-

PREPARED TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION, PRESUMABLY AT THE END OF

\"YEAH\" BUT THEN NOTED THAT SEVERAL MONTHS STILL REMAINED

BUT DON\'T IGNORE CROATIA

8. BUT THE CURRENT APPROACH WAS \"DANGEROUS,\" SARINIC SAID, 
BECAUSE CROATIA WAS AGAIN ON THE BACK BURNER FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  COMMENTING ON THE EU\'S CANNES 
STATEMENT, SARINIC ARGUED THAT RECOGNITION OF CROATIA AND 
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA BY THE \"FRY\" SHOULD BE A PACKAGE.  THE 
U.S. HAD SEEMED TO BELIEVE THIS, SARINIC SAID, \"BUT THEN 
MR. FRASURE MADE HIS TRIPS TO BELGRADE.\"  RECOGNITION OF 
B-H BY MILOSEVIC \"WILL CHANGE NOTHING,\" WHEREAS 
RECOGNITION OF CROATIA COULD ACTUALLY PAY REAL DIVIDENDS. 
THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SARINIC THAT THE SANCTIONS PACKAGE 
PRESENTED TO MILOSEVIC STILL SOMETHING IN RESERVE LINKED 
TO RECOGNITION OF CROATIA.  BUT SARINIC AGAIN NOTED THAT 
CROATIA HAD SUNK INTO \"THE SECOND LINE\" AGAIN, AND 
COMMENTED THAT MANY IN THE GOC DREW THE LESSON THAT \"WE 
ONLY SEE POLITICAL ATTENTION WHEN THERE ARE HOSTILITIES.\"

9. OBSERVING THAT WE HAD NO REAL CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM OVER 
THE PROSPECTS FOR ZAGREB-KNIN TALKS, THE AMBASSADOR URGED 
SARINIC TO PURSUE A \"SECOND TRACK\" OF DISCUSSIONS: WITH 
THE SERBIAN COMMUNITY ON CROATIAN GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
TERRITORY.  THIS INCLUDED SERBS WHO HAD STAYED IN CITIES 
SUCH AS ZAGREB OR RIJEKA THROUGHOUT THE WAR, BUT ALSO 
THOSE SERBS WHO REMAINED IN, OR RETURNED TO, THEIR HOMES 
IN WESTERN SLAVONIA (SECTOR WEST).  MANY STEPS COULD BE 
TAKEN SUCH AS: REBUILDING SERB AS WELL AS CROAT HOMES 
DAMAGED DURING THE WAR, TAKING STEPS AGAINST EMPLOYMENT 
DISCRIMINATION, GIVING THE SERBS MORE OF A VOICE IN 
CURRICULUM DECISIONS, AND PUNISHING ANY CROATIANS WHO MAY 
HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST SERBS IN THE AFTERMATH OF 
OPERATION \"FLASH.\"  BUT THIS WERE JUST SOME IDEAS, PERHAPS 
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WOULD BE TO BEGAN A PUBLIC, AND 
OFFICIAL, DIALOGUE WITH SERB COMMUNITY LEADERS, SO THAT 
THEY FELT THEY HAD AN INFLUENCE ON THE DECISIONS TAKEN BY 
THE GOC.  RIGHT NOW, THE AMBASSADOR NOTED, THE SERBS OF 
CROATIA FEEL SHUT OUT FROM DECISION-MAKING, EVEN ON THE 
ISSUES OF GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO THEM.  THE AMBASSADOR

2.  THE UN REPORTS THAT 26,000 REFUGEES FROM SREBRENICA 
ARE STILL BEING TAKEN CARE OF BY THE DUTCH BATTALION IN 
POTOCARI, HOWEVER, FOOD IS EXPECTED RUN OUT BEFORE THE END 
OF THE DAY.  SEVERAL THOUSAND DRAFT AGE MALES ARE REPORTED 
TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY BY THE BSA FOR QUESTIONING 
REGARDING WAR CRIMES CHARGES, BUT THE DESTINATION IS 
UNKNOWN (POSSIBLY TO BRATUNAC WHERE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS 
INDICATE THAT 48 DUTCH PEACEKEEPERS ARE STILL REING 
\"DETAINED.\")  SO FAR, 6,000 DISPLACED PERSONS (DP\'S) HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN TO KLADANJ IN BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT TERRITORY. 
THE BSA IS TAKING REFUGEES BY BUS AS FAR AS 1-2 KILOMETERS 
FROM THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT LINES AND THEN TELLING THEM TO 
WALK THE REST OF THE WAY.  UNHCR WILL MOVE THE GROUP AT 
KLADANJ TO TUZLA, WHERE 4,000 DP\'S ARE LOCATED AT THE 
AIRPORT, IN AN AREA THAT IS STILL SURROUNDED BY MINES.

ONE GROUP OF 33 WOUNDED REFUGEES WHO WERE UNABLE TO WALK 
TO GOBH LINES TRIED TO TURN BACK TO POTOCARI, BUT WERE 
STOPPED AT A BSA CHECKPOINT AND ARE BEING DENIED ACCESS TO 
MEDICAL CARE.  A UNHCR CONVOY FROM BELGRADE CARRYING FOOD, 
WATER, MEDECINE, AND SANITARY SUPPLIES TO POTOCARI IS 
BEING DETAINED BY THE BSA. 
 
3.  SOURCES AT THE UN AND IOM TOLD US THAT BOSNIAN 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE ALSO IMPEDING ASSISTANCE TO 
REFUGEES IN ORDER TO WORSEN THE SITUATION AND FOCUS 
INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.  GOBH MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO 
HASAN MURATOVIC REPORTEDLY TOOK A HARD LINE WITH UNHCR, 
SAYING THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARE OF THE REFUGEES LIES 
SOLELY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  WE WERE TOLD 
THAT GOBH AUTHORITIES ARE BLOCKING UNHCR ATTEMPTS TO MOVE 
DP\'S FROM THE TUZLA AIRPORT INTO 11,000 SPACES IN TOWN AND 
IOM REPORTED THAT 40 INJURED DP\'S WERE TURNED AWAY FROM 
TUZLA HOSPITAL.  UN CONTACTS ALSO ACCUSED THE GOBH OF 
DELAYING AID CONVOYS. 
 
4.  AS OF NOON ON JULY 13, GORAZDE AND ZEPA ARE REPORTED 
TO BE CALM.  HOWEVER, THE UN STATED THAT THERE IS LITTLE 
THAT COULD BE DONE TO KEEP THE ZEPA ENCLAVE FROM BEING 
OVERRUN IN CASE OF AN ATTACK.  THERE ARE NO CURRENT PLANS 
TO REINFORCE THE 70 UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS IN THE TOWN.

UN DEPUTY PRESS SPOKESMAN CHRIS GUNNESS SAID THAT 
REESTABLISHMENT OF THE SAFE AREA IS NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN 
AS IT WOULD REQUIRE RECONQUERING THE ENCLAVE.  THE 
SITUATION IN SREBRENICA, HE SAID, SHOWS THAT THE CONCEPT 
OF SAFE AREAS IS UNREALISTIC.  THIS CRISIS IS ANOTHER 
EXAMPLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PURSUING LOFTY 
OBJECTIVES WITHOUT PROVIDING THE UN WITH SUFFICIENT 
RESOURCES TO CARRY THEM OUT.  WHEN ASKED IF UNPROFOR WILL 
PROTECT THE OTHER SAFE AREAS IN CASE OF ATTACK, THE 
SPOKESMAN\'S OFFICE REPLIED THAT UNPROFOR COULD DO THIS 
ONLY IF MEMBER STATES HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL TO PROVIDE 
THE MILITARY RESOURCES.  REFERRING TO A POSSIBLE ROLE FOR 
THE RAPID REACTION FORCE, GUNNESS SAID THAT TROOP 
CONTRIBUTORS STILL HAVE NOT INDICATED HOW THIS FORCE IS TO

SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
2.  SPEAKING JULY 13, CROATIAN FM GRANIC USED THE FALL 
OF SREBRENICA TO REINFORCE THE POINT HE HAS BEEN MAKING 
FOR SOME TIME, THAT BELGRADE IS RESPONSIBLE AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST EXERT STRONG PRESSURE ON 
MILOSEVIC.  OVERALL, GRANIC\'S MESSAGE WAS ONE OF 
REASSURANCE THAT CROATIA REMAINED COMMITTED TO PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION OF THE REGION\'S PROBLEMS AND RESTRAINT IN 
THE FACE OF PROVOCATION.  BUT HE DID LAY DOWN MARKERS 
CONCERNING UNCRO\'S NONPERFORMANCE OF ITS MANDATE AND 
POSSIBLE SERB MILITARY THREATS TO BIHAC.  REFERRING TO 
EVIDENCE OF A SERB BUILDUP AROUND BIHAC, HE MADE CLEAR 
THIS WOULD BE OF MUCH MORE DIRECT CONCERN TO CROATIA, 
AND COULD LEAD TO A \"WIDENING OF THE WAR,\" THOUGH HE 
STOPPED SHORT OF PREDICTING CROATIAN MILITARY ACTION TO 
PRESERVE BIHAC\'S \"PROTECTED ZONE\" STATUS.  END SUMMARY

3.  CROATIAN FM GRANIC CONVOKED AMBASSADORS/CHARGES OF 
CONTACT GROUP, UNSC, EU TROIKA, AND OSCE PRESIDENCY 
COUNTRIES JULY 13 FOR A REAOOUT OF THE CROATIAN VIEW OF 
THE FALL OF SREBRENICA. 
 
----------------------- 
SITUATION ON THE GROUND 
----------------------- 
 
4.  REVIEWING THE SITUATION IN SREBRENICA AND ZEPA, 
GRANIC ADDED LITTLE TO WHAT THE UN HAS ALREADY PUT OUT. 
HE USED THE FIGURE OF 55,000 FOR TOTAL REFUGEES AND 
NOTED THAT MILITARY AGE MEN WERE BEING SEPARATED OUT 
AND WOULD BE CHARGED WITH WAR CRIMES.  HE CALLED THE 
SERB ACTION IN CAPTURING THE \"ONE TRULY DEMILITARIZED 
ZONE\" IN B-H \"UNJUSTIFIED,\" CLAIMING THAT CHARGES THAT 
MILITARY ATTACKS WERE BEING ORGANIZED FROM INSIDE 
SREBRENICA WERE GROUNDLESS AND COULD BE DISPROVED BY 
LOOKING AT THE LOW \"RATIO OF WEAPONS\" FOUND AMONG THE 
PEOPLE THERE.  GRANIC SAID THAT THE NEW REFUGEES WOULD 
MOSTLY END UP ON FEDERATION TERRITORY, ESPECIALLY TUZLA 
AND ZENICA, AND WOULD DESTABILIZE THE SITUATION THERE 
BY FURTHER CROWOING OF AN ALREADY-REDUCED SPACE. 
NOTING THERE HAD BEEN MORE FIGHTING AROUND ZEPA, HE 
SAID CONFIDENCE THAT THE UN WOULD DO ANYTHING TO 
PROTECT ZEPA WAS \"ALMOST NIL.\"

5.  GRANIC ARGUED THAT NEITHER KARADZIC NOR MLADIC 
COULD DECIDE TO CONDUCT ACTIONS LIKE SREBRENICA WITHOUT 
MILOSEVIC\'S OK.  BELGRADE WAS ATTEMPTING TO IMPOSE A 
SOLUTION BY FORCE; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS 
\"APPEASING\" HIM -- HE STEPPED UP THE WAR, JUST A FEW 
DAYS AFTER A RENEWAL OF LIMITED SANCTIONS RELIEF, AND 
SUFFERED NO CONSEQUENCES. 
 
6.  THE GOC, SAID GRANIC, WOULD CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO 
THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE WASHINGTON AGREEMENT AND 
THE CONTACT GROUP PLAN.  IT WOULD NOT RESPOND TO 
PROVOCATIONS, AND WOULD CONTINUE TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT. 
\"EVEN THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS\" WOULD NOT SWAY ZAGREB 
FROM ITS PEACEFUL COURSE.  EVENTS IN SREBRENICA WOULD 
BIND CROATIA AND B-H MORE CLOSELY, AND CROATIA WOULD 
CONTINUE ITS STRONG SUPPORT FOR BUILDING THE 
FEDERATION.  AS SOON AS THE LOGISTICS COULD BE WORKED 
OUT, TUDJMAN AND IZETBEGOVIC WOULD MEET WITH SENIOR 
FEDERATION OFFICIALS.  (NOTE:  GRANIC TOLD A/DCM JULY

THAT CROATIA WAS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED BY OBSERVED 
\"MASSING OF SERB FORCES\" IN THE BIHAC POCKET, 
ESPECIALLY NEAR SLUNJ.  HE SAID THAT ANY SERB ACTION TO 
TAKE BIHAC WOULD BE TAKEN \"EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY.\"  ASKED 
LATER WHAT ACTION CROATIA WOULD TAKE IF THE SERBS 
ATTACKED BIHAC, GRANIC SAID HE HOPED IT \"WOULD NOT COME 
TO THAT\" BECAUSE SUCH ACTION WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR THE 
SERBS IN \"SEVERAL WAYS.\"  GRANIC SAID TUDJMAN\'S MESSAGE 
WAS THAT IT WAS CRUCIAL TO \"ACCELERATE THE PEACE 
PROCESS,\" AND THIS WAS WHERE CROATIA\'S EFFORTS WOULD 
CONCENTRATE.  HE NOTED THE POSSIBILITY OF \"INDIRECT 
HELP,\" E.G., SUCH AS HVO ACTION IN LIVANSKO POLJE, 
WHICH HAD \"HELPED RELIEVE PRESSURE\" ON THE BOSNIAN V 
CORPS WHEN BIHAC WAS THREATENED AT THE END OF LAST 
YEAR.  (NOTE: AT ONE POINT GRANIC SAID THAT AN \"ATTACK 
ON BIHAC BY THE SERBS WOULD CERTAINLY WIDEN THE WAR\" 
BUT THIS WAS NOT TRANSLATED BY THE INTERPRETER.)

LOW-LEVEL BUREAUCRATIC NAGGING AND EVEN PERSISTENT ABUSE. 
BY FAR THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM, HE SAID, WAS OBTAINING 
FUNDS TO PAY PRIVATE LAWYERS FOR THE COMPETENT DEFENSE OF 
SERBS STILL INTERNED ON CHARGES OF WAR CRIMES.  (NOTE: 
SEVERAL OTHER UN OFFICIALS HAVE RECENTLY CRITICIZED TO US 
THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND JUDGES 
ASSIGNED TO THESE CASES.  MOST OF THE CROATIAN LAWYERS HAD 
NOT INTERVIEWED OR EVEN MET WITH THEIR CLIENTS BEFORE THE 
TRIALS STARTED.  IF THE LAWYERS ARRIVED AT THE TRIALS AT 
ALL, THEY EITHER CAME LATE, OR LEFT EARLY.  JUST DAYS 
AFTER THE TRIALS STARTED, SEVERAL JUDGES RECESSED FOR A 
ONE-MONTH SUMMER VACATION, LEAVING THE ACCUSED TO PONDER 
THEIR FATE IN HOT, OVERCROWDED JAILS.  180 MEN HAVE BEEN 
INDICTED AND ONLY FOUR LAWYERS WERE ASSIGNED TO DEFEND 
THEM.  TWENTY CASES HAVE GONE TO TRIAL AT THIS TIME.  AN 
OFFICIAL AT THE UN CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (THE 
\"MAZOWIECKI\" COMMISSION) SAID ALL THE CHARGES WERE 
ABSTRACT, AND UNCHR WAS ATTEMPTING TO GET THEM DROPPED. 
UN OFFICIALS ARE MONITORING THESE TRIALS DAILY. 
 
4.  ONLY ONE INDIVIDUAL, MLADEN KULIC, HAS A PRIVATE 
LAWYER, LOCATED FOR HIM BY UNOV (UN OFFICE IN VIENNA) 
OFFICIAL MICHAEL PLATZER (PROTECT).  PLATZER SAID THIS 
LAWYER HAD BEEN HARASSED BY SEVERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND 
EVEN ONE JUDGE FOR TAKING ON HER CLIENT.  AGAINST ALL 
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, AND CONTRARY TO GOC TREATY 
OBLIGATIONS, CROATIAN POLICE INSISTED ON ATTENDING THE 
PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS SHE HELD WITH HER CLIENT.  THE UN HAS 
IDENTIFIED COMPETENT PRIVATE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE WILLING TO 
TAKE OTHER CASES.  HOWEVER, PRO BONO WORK IS NOT ALLOWED 
UNDER CROATIAN LAW.  MANY LAWYERS ARE NOT WILLING TO BILL

THE UN LACKED FUNDS TO PAY THE OBLIGATORY USD 200

NOVSKA AREA, CONTINUED TO BE INTIMIDATED AND PHYSICALLY 
HASSLED BY RETURNING CROATIANS AND EVEN POLICE PATROLLING 
THE AREA.  THE ISSUE OF RETURNING LIVESTOCK TO ITS 
ORIGINAL OWNERS HAS BECOME CONTENTIOUS.  THE GOC ROUNDED 
UP ALL THE FARM ANIMALS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE CRISIS 
 
SINCE NO ONE WAS LEFT TO CARE FOR THEM IN THE WAKE OF 
REFUGEE FLIGHTS AND GOC DETENTION OF THE LOCAL POPULATION. 
MOST OF THESE ANIMALS WERE PLACED WITH NEARBY CROAT 
FARMERS FOR CARETAKING.  DAY REPORTED THAT THE GOC HAS

IN BELGRADE HAVE EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO RETURN TO THEIR 
HOMES IN CROATIA.  THEY HAD LEFT IN MAY AND JUNE WITH THE

\"ARSK\" ATTACK ON BIHAC LIMITED 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  ON JULY 25, POLOFFS MET WITH UNPF CHIEF OF STAFF 
GENERAL KOLSTEREN TO DISCUSS THE \"ARSK\" OFFENSIVE IN BIHAC 
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR GOC REACTION.  KOLSTEREN TOLD US 
THAT THE UN\'S ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IN BIHAC LEADS TO 
THE CONCLUSION THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE \"ARSK\" OPERATION 
IS ONLY TO RETAKE AREAS OF THE POCKET HELD BY ABDIC PRIOR 
TO HIS EXPULSION BY THE GOBH V CORPS LAST YEAR.  ATTACKS 
BY THE BSA ARE BELIEVED TO BE ONLY DIVERSIONARY.  \"ARSK-\" 
ABDIC ACTION WOULD CREATE A RUFFER ZONE TO PROTECT SERB 
VILLAGES FROM ATTACKS BY GOBH FORCES, WHICH HE RLAMED FOR 
PRECIPITATING THE ATTACKS.  HE SAID THAT GORH MILITARY 
COMMAND LOCATED V CORPS HQ IN DOWNTOWN BIHAC IN A 
DISINGENUOUS EFFORT TO DRAW NATO AIRSTRIKES ON ATTACKING 
SERBS.

3.  MEANWHILE, UN SENIOR POLITICAL ADVISOR ALMSTROM TOLD 
US JULY 25 THAT THE LEVEL OF FIGHTING IN BIHAC SEEMED TO 
HAVE DECREASED SOMEWHAT.  CONTRARY TO KOLSTEREN, ALMSTROM 
SAID THAT UN ANALYSTS ARE QUESTIONING \"WHETHER THE BOSNIAN 
SERBS\" ARE INVOLVED OR NOT; ALMSTROM ECHOED KOLSTEREN\'S 
COMMENTS THAT THE CURRENT CONFRONTATION LINE LOOKS VERY 
MUCH LIKE THE AREA THAT ABDIC FORCES CONTROLLED ABOUT A 
YEAR AGO AND SPECULATED THAT THE ARSK MIGHT BE HELPING 
ABDIC TO REGAIN LOST GROUND IN RETURN FOR HIS COOPERATION 
NOW AND IN THE PAST.  KOLSTEREN AND ALMSTROM BOTH DOUBTED 
THAT THE ARSK WOULD PRESS ITS ATTACK BECAUSE THEY MUST 
RECOGNIZE THE CROATIAN THREAT.  (ALMSTROM ADDED THAT ALL 
FORCES IN THE AREA HAD SCRUPULOUSLY AVOIDED ACTIVITY IN 
THE SAFE ZONE, I.E., BIHAC TOWN ITSELF). 
 
-------------------------------- 
GOC WILL RESPOND BEFORE NOVEMBER 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  IN KOLSTEREN\'S OPINION, THE GOC COULD USE ATTACKS ON 
BIHAC AS AN EXCUSE TO RETAKE THE \"RSK\" BUT HAD NO 
INDICATIONS THAT ANY ASSAULT WAS IMMINENT.  HE SAID THAT 
THE HV COULD BEGIN AN ATTACK INTO SECTOR SOUTH FROM THE 
FREE CROATIA AND BOSNIA IN A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS, BUT WOULD 
DEFINITELY MOVE BEFORE THE END OF THE UNCRO MANDATE IN 
NOVEMBER AND THE ONSET OF WINTER.  HE SAID THAT THE LONGER 
THE GOC WAITS TO ATTACK, THE LONGER \"ARSK\" MILITARY 
COMMANDER GENERAL MRKSIC HAS TO STRENGTHEN HIS FORCES.  IF 
THE GOC DECIDES TO ATTACK, HE TOLD US THAT HE THINKS 
MILOSEVIC WILL DO NOTHING TO IN DEFENSE OF THE \"RSK\" 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

BECAUSE HE HAS EVERYTHING HE WANTS IN SECTOR EAST, AND THE 
BSA WILL PROVIDE LITTLE HELP BECAUSE IT IS STRETCHED THIN 
IN BOSNIA. 
 
5.  ALMSTROM SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE 
CROATS UNDERTOOK SOME ACTIVITY IN THE LIVNO VALLEY, BUT 
THE UN HAD \"NO EVIDENCE\" AS OF 1600 JULY 25 THAT THEY HAD 
DONE SO.  (COMMENT:  DATT HAS REPORTED THAT AS OF 0500 ON 
JULY 25, THE HVO BEGAN AN OPERATION AGAINST GLAMOC.) 
TROUBLE HAD FLARED AGAIN NEAR OSIJEK ON JULY 24, ALMSTROM 
SAID, BUT HAD BEEN SEEMINGLY CALMED AGAIN BY LOCAL 
COMMANDERS.

THE \"DUAL KEY\" THEN UNPROFOR WILL BE FORCED TO WITHDRAW

AS THUGS AND CRIMINALS, RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMES AGAINST 
SERB AND MUSLIM CIVILIANS, WHO ARE AFRAID OF BEING 
CAPTURED BY THE BSA. 
 
SITUATION IN ZEPA

8.  ALMSTROM DENIED BROADCAST NEWS REPORTS THAT ZEPA HAD 
FINALLY \"FALLEN\" TO THE SERBS.  HE SAID THE SITUATION 
THERE REMAINED \"CONFUSING.\"  HE ADMITTED THE UKRAINIANS 
WERE HUNKERED DOWN, TAKING MORTAR FIRE FROM BOTH (I.E. 
MUSLIM AND SERB) SIDES AND UNABLE TO DO MUCH OBSERVING. 
B-H FORCES WERE PUTTING UP A STIFF RESISTANCE; MLADIC WAS 
CURIOUSLY RELUCTANT TO MOVE IN AND FINISH THE JOB, BUT HE 
MUST ALSO BE CHAFING, HAVING CLAIMED ALMOST A WEEK AGO 
THAT HIS ARMY HAD TAKEN CONTROL OF ZEPA.  ALMSTROM 
REPORTED VARIOUS \"RUMORS\" THAT THERE WAS SOME AGREEMENT 
UNDER WHICH UNPROFOR WOULD COLLECT WEAPONS IN ZEPA IN 
RETURN FOR WHICH THE CIVILIANS COULD BE RELEASED BUT 
AKASHI WAS OF THE FIRM VIEW THAT VULNERABLE CIVILIANS; 
MUST BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE, PERIOD, WITHOUT ANY 
PRECONDITIONS.

BY UNPF YASUSHI AKASHI. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
YOUR EXCELLENCY, IN RESPONSE TO YOUR FAX WHICH I 
RECEIVED AT 9:30 PM TODAY ENCLOSING PROPOSALS BY THE 
REBEL SERB LEADERSHIP IN KNIN, I STATE THE FOLLOWING: 
 
1.  IT IS SURPRISING THAT YOU MAKE NO MENTION OF 
UNCRO -- THE UNITED NATIONS\' PEACE KEEPING FORCES, 
WHICH UNDER THAT NAME GOT THE MANDATE IN THE REPUBLIC 
OF CROATIA BY A UN RESOLUTION, WHILE YOU MENTION THE 
KNIN LEADERSHIP AND RSK; 
 
2.  WE FIND IT UNACCEPTABLE THAT UNCRO BE DEPLOYED ONLY 
ALONG THE BORDER TOWARDS THE BIHAC POCKET.  OUR DEMAND 
WAS AND STILL IS THAT UNCRO TAKE OVER THE CONTROL OF 
THE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BORDERS BETWEEN THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA, BUT AT THE 
SAME TIME BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND SERBIA, 
THAT IS, THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA.  THIS 
REPRESENTS A BURNING ISSUE IN THE LIGHT OF NEW 
DEPLOYMENT OF YUGOSLAV ARMY TROOPS AND EQUIPMENT ACROSS 
THE DANUBE RIVER; 
 
3.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ITEM NUMBER 2, WE REFUSE 
THAT UN MILITARY OBSERVERS FOR BORDER CONTROL BE 
DEPLOYED ONLY IN THE AREA OF MT. DINARA. 
 
4.  REBEL SERB LEADERS AGAIN WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OVER UN AND UNCRO WHICH CAN BE SEEN FROM THEIR PROPOSAL 
TO LET HUMANITARIAN AID CONVOYS ENTER BIHAC ONLY IF AT 
THE SAME TIME THEY RECEIVE HUMANITARIAN AID. 
 
5.  SUCH PROPOSALS ARE NO BASIS FOR A PEACEFUL 
REINTEGRATION AND DO NOT CONTAIN ANSWERS TO ANY OF THE 
CONDITIONS I MADE DURING THE TALKS WITH YOU ON 
SATURDAY, 29 JULY, 1995, WHEN I EXPLICITLY SAID THAT 
THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CROATIAN REBEL SERBS COULD 
START UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: 
     A)  THE CROATIAN AUTHORITIES SHALL NOT CONDUCT 
TALKS WITH MILAN MARTIC, WHO WAS PUT BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL IN DEN HAGUE ON THE 
LIST OF WAR CRIMINALS, AS WELL AS WITH NO OTHER PERSON 
SPEAKING ON HIS BEHALF 
 
     B)  DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS SHALL BE CONDUCTED ON THE 
OPENING OF ALL COMMUNICATIONS WHICH RUN THROUGH THE 
OCCUPIED AREAS, ESPECIALLY OF THE ZAGREB-KNIN-SPLIT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CROATIAN CONSTITUTION ON THE 
OCCUPIED AREAS SHALL BEGIN, AS WELL AS THE TALKS ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT 
ON SERB ETHNIC COMMUNITY\'S RIGHTS. 
 
6.  ONLY ON THESE BASES IS IT POSSIBLE TO REACH A 
PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND START THE PROPOSED NEGOTIATIONS 
BETWEEN MILITARY AND CIVIL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE 
CROATIAN AUTHORITIES AND THE CROATIAN REBEL SERBS.

HANDS TIED BEHIND HIM, HE SAW IN THE MOONLIGHT AN 
OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF DEAD BODIES, COMPLETELY COVERING A 
SMALL FIELD.  HE WOULD NOT ESTIMATE HOW MANY BODIES HE 
SAW.  THERE WERE MANY MORE BODIES, HE SAID, THAN COULD 
HAVE POSSIBLY FIT INTO THE TRUCKS THERE.  A SERB VOICE 
CALLED OUT AND TOLD THEM TO \"CHOOSE A PLACE\" TOGETHER IN A

HE LAY IN SEMI-CONSCIOUSNESS, HEARING PEOPLE SCREAMING 
WITH PAIN.  THE SERBS CONTINUED TO SHOOT PEOPLE.  AS HE 
LAY ALMOST DEAD, A STONE FROM THE GROUND RICOCHETED INTO 
HIS LEFT FOOT.  HE HEARD A SERB ORDER AN OLD MAN TO SAY 
ALLAH AL AKBAR, THEN SHOOT HIM WITH SEVERAL ROUNDS AS THE 
OLD MAN SPOKE.  WHEN THE SHOOTING FINALLY STOPPED, A SERB 
YELLED, \"LOOK AT ALL THESE WELL-FATTED RABBITS.  IT\'S BEEN 
A GOOD HUNT.\"  SOMEONE ORDERED THAT THE CORPSES BE CHECKED 
TO SEE IF THEY WERE ALIVE.  ALTHOUGH SOLDIERS WALKED AMONG 
THE GROUP, NO ONE TOUCHED N.A.  AFTER A WHILE, THE TRUCKS 
STARTED UP AND LEFT.

MAN BIT THROUGH THE CORD TYING N.A.\'S HANDS, THEN N.A. 
TRIED TO BITE THROUGH THE FOUR CORDS OF ROPE BINDING THE 
OTHER.  AFTER HE HAD BROKEN TWO, THEY HEARD VEHICLES 
COMING BACK.  THE OTHER MAN, O.H., ONLY SLIGHTLY GRAZED, 
HELPED N.A., TO RUN TO THE WOOD.  THEY HID IN A SMALL 
WOODED CREEK DOWNHILL FROM THE FIELD.  BOTH HEARD STRANGE, 
THUD-LIKE NOISES AND SHOOTING, THOUGH MORE IRREGULAR THAN 
PREVIOUSLY.  N.A. BELIEVED THAT THE SERBS HAD RETURNED TO 
CART OFF THE BODIES.  O.H. WAS NOT ON THE SAME TRUCK AS 
N.A.   HE WAS WEARING A SHIRT, UNLIKE N.A., AND USED IT TO 
BANDAGE N.A.\'S WOUNDS.

O.H. HAD TO CARRY N.A. MUCH OF THE WAY BECAUSE HE WAS SO 
WEAK.  AFTER FOUR DAYS, THEY CROSSED INTO MUSLIM-HELD 
TERRITORY.  MOST OF THE TIME THEY WERE LOST, AND WERE 
GUIDED TO THE FRONT LINE BY GUNFIRE.  N.A. HAD EATEN 
ALMOST NOTHING FOR SIX DAYS AND DRUNK ONLY CREEK WATER. 
N.A. SAID THE TWO CAME OUT NEAR THE VILLAGE OF SAPNA, 
WHERE HE WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR A FEW DAYS.  THEN HE WAS 
TAKEN TO GRADINA HOSPITAL IN TUZLA, FROM WHERE HE WAS 
RELEASED.  HE FOUND HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS IN TUZLA, BUT 
STILL FEARS FOR HIS FATHER.

PIERCED HIS RIGHT SIDE AND IMMEDIATELY EXITED THROUGH HIS 
STOMACH, ONE HAD PIERCED HIS MIDDLE RIGHT ARM, AND A SMALL 
PEBBLE HAD LODGED IN HIS LEFT FOOT.  HE ALSO HAD MANY

SUMMARY

2.  BENKOVAC FELL TO HV FORCES AT 17:55 LOCAL. 
PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF HRVOJE SARINIC EXPRESSED 
CONDITIONAL GOC INTEREST IN STOPPING ALL MILITARY 
OPERATIONS AND CONDUCTING POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH SERB 
INTERLOCUTORS, INCLUDING BABIC.  HE SAID THAT THE GOC 
CONSIDERED SERBS ATTACKS ON DUBROVNIK AND EASTERN SLAVONIA 
TO BE ONLY PROVOCATIONS, AND THAT THE HV WOULD NOT BE 
DRAWN INTO OPENING ANOTHER FRONT WITH THE SERBS.  SERB 
FORCES WERE PRESENTING MOST RESISTANCE IN SECTOR NORTH, 
AROUND SLUNJ, AND THE HV EXPECTS TO HAVE THIS TERRITORY

END SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
KNIN FALLS 
---------- 
 
3.  SARINIC CONFIRMED TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE HV NOW 
HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OVER KNIN.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE KNIN 
CIVIL AUTHORITIES HAD FLED THE CITY IN A PANIC AND HAD NO 
TIME TO CARRY WITH THEM OR DESTROY GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS 
AND RECORDS, ALTHOUGH HE SAID IT WAS TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT 
REMAINED.  SERB RESISTANCE WAS STILL HOLDING OUT IN THE 
TOWNS OF BENKOVAC AND OBROVAC IN WESTERN PART OF SECTOR 
SOUTH.  HOWEVER, HE CONFIRMED THAT HV FORCES HAD 
PENETRATED TO THE CROATIAN INTERNATIONAL BORDER AND HAD 
LINKED UP WITH ABH FIFTH CORPS TROOPS AT KOSTAJNICA. 
(NOTE: THE HV COMMANDER IN OGULIN SAID THAT HIS FORCES 
PLANNED TO LINK UP WITH FIFTH CORPS NEAR RAKOVICA ON 
AUGUST 6.)  EARLIER IN THE DAY, SARINIC SAID HE HAD 
PROMISED SRSG AKASHI AND UNPF COMMANDER JANVIER THAT UNCRO 
WOULD BE ALLOWED TO PATROL KNIN AND CONTINUE OPERATIONS 
THERE, BUT ONLY AFTER SAFETY CONDITIONS ALLOWED UNCRO TO 
RETURN.  HE INSISTED THAT IT WOULD BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY 
IMPORTANT TO THE REMAINING SERBS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY TO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN THE TOWN.

THE ABDIC FACTOR 
---------------- 
 
4.  SARINIC CLAIMED THAT OVER SIX HUNDRED TROOPS LOYAL TO 
RENEGADE MUSLIM LEADER FIKRET ABDIC HAD QUICKLY SHIFTED 
LOYALTIES TO THE HV AND THE ABH 5TH CORPS AS THESE TWO 
ARMIES CONSOLIDATED THEIR GAINS IN SECTOR NORTH AND THE 
BIHAC POCKET.  ABDIC, SARINIC OPINED, WAS A \"NORMAL GUY, 
NOT A FUNDAMENTALIST,\" DESPITE HIS OPPORTUNISTIC 
ASSOCIATION WITH MARTIC.  HE POSED NO PROBLEMS FOR THE 
GOC, PER SE.  YET THE GOC COULD NOT RISK ITS RELATIONSHIP 
WITH IZETBEGOVIC ON ABDIC\'S ACCOUNT.  HOWEVER, IN RECENT 
CONVERSATIONS WITH TUDJMAN, SARINIC WAS SURPRISED THAT 
IZETBEGOVIC APPEARED TO BE FLEXIBLE CONCERNING ABDIC.

UNCRO TROOP PRESENCE AND CASUALTIES 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  SARINIC COULD NOT CONFIRM THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
SURROUNDING THE DEATHS OF TWO CZECH UNMOS EARLIER TODAY.

SUBJECT:  CROATIA SITREP NO. 9 - AUGUST 5, 2130 HRS LOCAL 
 
THE DANE HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY THE SERBS AND THE HV HAD 
FOUND HIM WITH HIS HANDS TIED WITH WIRE.  TH 
E \"ARSK\" HAD 
USED HIM AS A HUMAN SHIELD DURING THE HV ATTACK ON THEM. 
SARINIC SAID THE DANE HAD DIED DURING THE RESCUE FLIGHT 
BACK TO THE MASH AT PLESO AIRPORT IN ZAGREB.  A POLISH 
UNMO (KOVALESKY - NFI) HAD DIED IN SERB-HELD TERRITORY, 
SARINIC SAID, BECAUSE THE SERBS HAD REFUSED TO ALLOW HIM 
ON A UN HELICOPTER TO PLESO THAT THE UN HAD ARRANGED AND 
CLEARED WITH THE CROATS. 
 
6.  AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH UNDERSCORED THAT THE SECURITY OF 
UN FORCES WAS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY.  HV FORCES MUST GO AROUND UN OBSERVATION POSTS 
(UNOPS), HE SAID, NOT THROUGH THEM.  SARINIC RESPONDED 
THAT AKASHI AND JANVIER HAD ASKED THAT UN COMPOUNDS NOT BE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

VIOLATED.  THESE COMPOUNDS NOW HELD FOUR HUNDRED UN 
PERSONNEL AND THREE HUNDRED SERBS SEEKING REFUGE.  THESE 
SERBS WOULD BE FREE TO REMAIN IN CROATIA OR LEAVE FOR 
SERB-HELD B-H IF THEY SO WISHED.  THE CROATIAN AMNESTY LAW 
WOULD APPLY TO ALL WHO STAYED EXCEPT THOSE \"SPECIAL CASES\" 
GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES, HE ASSERTED.  THE UN WOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ITS WORK IN KNIN, HE CONTINUED, AS 
SOON AS THE SECURITY RISK SITUATION ALLOWED THEM TO DO SO. 
KNIN WAS CURRENTLY UNDER A GENERAL AIR SIREN WARNING, HE 
SAID, BECAUSE SINCE 1430 LOCAL TIME, IT WAS BEING SHELLED 
FROM OBROVAC AND BENKOVAC. 
 
7.  SARINIC INSISTED THAT NOT A SINGLE HV SHELL HAD HIT 
THE KNIN UN COMPOUND.  IT WAS LOCATED OUT OF TOWN, AND THE 
HV FORCES HAD STRICT INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO TOUCH IT.  HE 
SAID ONE SHELL HAD FALLEN IN FRONT OF THE COMPOUND 
ENTRANCE.  CONFLICTING INFORMATION CONTINUED TO ARRIVE 
CONCERNING THE SITUATION INSIDE KNIN.  IN SARINIC\'S TALKS 
WITH THE UNPF LEADERS, GENERAL JANVIER HAD SAID THAT 
BODIES HAD LINED THE STREETS OF KNIN, YET AKASHI HAD 
CLAIMED THAT THERE WERE ONLY A FEW CASUALTIES. 
 
--------------------------- 
CONTINUED MILITARY ACTIVITY 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  THE SERBS CONTINUED TO MOUNT THE STRONGEST RESISTANCE 
IN SECTOR NORTH, HE SAID, BETWEEN GLINA AND PETRINJA.  HE 
EXPECTED OPERATIONS THERE TO CONTINUE ANOTHER 24-48 HOURS. 
ONE DOZEN TANKS STILL HELD OUT IN THE AREA.  THEY WERE 
UNABLE TO MOVE DUE TO MECHANICAL FAILURES, YET THEIR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

CANNONS STILL FUNCTIONED WELL.  TWO HV INFANTRY ATTACKS 
HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL AT TAKING THEM OUT, SO THE ARMY HAD 
SURROUNDED THE TANKS AND WOULD NOT RISK FURTHER INFANTRY 
CASUALTIES. 
 
9.  AKASHI AND JANVIER HAD PROPOSED TO SARINIC A CESSATION 
OF HOSTILITIES AND WOULD PRESENT A PAPER TO SARINIC LATER 
THIS EVENING AT 1800.  SARINIC SAID THE GOC WOULD ONLY 
ACCEPT PROPOSALS THAT INCLUDED THE COMPLETE SURRENDER AND 
DISARMAMENT OF RSK FORCES IN BOTH THE SECTORS.  SARINIC 
WAS PREPARED TO STOP ALL MILITARY ACTIVITY TONIGHT IF THE 
SERBS WOULD AGREE TO THESE CONDITIONS. 
 
------------------------------------- 
BABIC AND POSSIBLE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS 
------------------------------------- 
 
10.  IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION EARLIER IN THE DAY, 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE SUSAK REQUESTED THAT THE AMBASSADOR 
PLAY A ROLE IN CEASEFIRE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SERBS. 
AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH THEN OUTLINED TO SARINIC HIS 
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MILAN BABIC THE DAY BEFORE. 
SARINIC SAID THAT BABIC COULD HAVE A USEFUL ROLE IN 
APPEALING TO ALL REMAINING RSK FORCES IN THE TWO SECTORS

TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS.  HOWEVER, HE MAINTAINED THAT THE 
GOC WOULD ONLY AGREE TO NEGOTIATE WITH BABIC AS LONG AS 
FIGHTING STILL CONTINUED.  SHOULD THE \"ARSK\" NOT SURRENDER 
AND THE HV TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE TERRITORY 
MILITARILY, NEGOTIATIONS WITH BABIC WOULD NO LONGER BE AN 
OPTION.  THE GOC WOULD THEN SEEK OUT OTHER SERB LEADERS 
AND INTERLOCUTORS WHO STILL WISHED TO REMAIN IN THE 
SECTOR, SUCH AS VJEKOSLAV DJAKULA IN WESTERN SLAVONIA. 
 
11.  BABIC HAD TO BE CONTACTED THAT SAME EVENING ABOUT 
CEASEFIRE NEGOTIATIONS, SARINIC INSISTED, FOR THIS IDEA TO 
BE AT ALL SUCCESSFUL.  THE AMBASSADOR AGREED TO BE THE 
POINT OF INITIAL CONTACT WITH BABIC, AND WOULD PLAY AN 
ADDITIONAL ROLE AS REQUESTED BY THE PARTIES, SUBJECT TO 
WASHINGTON\'S APPROVAL.  HE INSISTE 
D THAT SUCH NEGOTIATIONS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

INCLUDE A POSITIVE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT FOR A WESTERN 
KRAJINA WITHIN CROATIA.  SARINIC WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT 
BABIC\'S ABILITY TO DELIVER ON THE MILITARY FRONT, BUT 
AGREED.  THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED THAT SUCH A SETTLEMENT 
MUST MAKE LOCAL SERBS FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN THEIR 
CHOICE TO REMAIN IN KRAJINA.  BABIC WAS AN IDEAL 
INTERLOCUTOR BECAUSE HE HAD POPULAR SUPPORT AMONG THE 
PEOPLE OF KRAJINA.  THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS ESSENTIAL IN GAINING THE 
CONFIDENCE OF THE LOCAL SERBIAN POPULATION.  A POSITIVE 
RESOLUTION IN THE KRAJINA ALSO HELD SIGNIFICANT 
IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN SECTOR EAST. 
 
12.  SARINIC REPLIED THAT CROATIA WOULD BE PREPARED TO 
DISCUSS ISSUES OF CIVILIAN AUTHORITY AND CULTURAL 
AUTONOMY, AS WELL AS COUNTY TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES.  THE 
AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT DISCUSSIONS WITH BABIC BE HELD 
IN ZAGREB AT A LOCATION OF THE GOC\'S CHOOSING, PREFERABLY 
NOT IN SECRET.  HE SUGGESTED OTHER INTERLOCUTORS THE GOC 
MIGHT WISH TO CONSIDER MIGHT BE VOJNOVIC, AND RADOVAN 
JOVIC, A RECENT USIS IV RECIPIENT.  SARINIC URGED THAT 
SUCH DISCUSSION START IMMEDIATELY.  AS SOON AS MILITARY 
ACTION FINISHED, CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE KRAJINA WOULD 
CHANGE, AND HE WOULD NO LONGER BE AMENABLE TO HOLDING 
DISCUSSIONS WITH BABIC. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
KRAJINA MUST RETAIN A SERBIAN POPULATION

EVERY EFFORT TO PROTECT THE LOCAL CIVILIAN POPULATION AND 
ENSURE THAT CONDITIONS ARE CREATED TO ENCOURAGE THE LOCAL 
POPULATION TO STAY.  SARINIC REPLIED THAT THE GOC WAS 
CONSTRAINED BY PUBLIC OPINION, WHICH WAS CONVINCED \"ONE 
HUNDRED PERCENT\" THAT A MILITARY SOLUTION WAS THE ONLY WAY 
TO RESOLVE THE KRAJINA PROBLEM.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED 
OUT THAT THE GOC AND THE GOBH NOW HAD THE PERFECT 
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE FACTORS ON THE GROUND TO PAVE THE 
WAY FOR A VIABLE PEACE SETTLEMENT IN THE REGION LATER THIS 
YEAR.

BILDT OUT ON A LIMB

14.  SARINIC EXPRESSED SHOCK AND DISMAY AT ICFY SPECIAL 
ENVOY CARL BILDT\'S STATEMENT EQUATING PRESIDENT TUDJMAN 
AND RSK LEADER MARTIC, CHARACTERIZING IT AS \"STUPID.\" 
ICFY MUST DEAL WITH CROATIA AND SUCH UNDIPLOMATIC AND 
UNPROFESSIONAL STATEMENTS WERE COMPLETELY UNPRODUCTIVE. 
HE SUGGESTED THAT THE GOC WOULD REFUSE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS 
WITH BILDT.

15.  SARINIC REMAINED CONCERNED ABOUT \"ARSK\" SHELLING ON 
OSIJEK AND VINKOVCI.  HE INSISTED THAT THE HV CONSIDERED 
THESE ATTACKS TO BE ONLY PROVOCATIONS, AND WOULD NOT 
RETALIATE.  HE CLAIMED THAT OVER 600 SHELLS HAD FALLEN ON 
VINKOVCI AND 6 ON OSIJEK SINCE THE START OF THE HV\'S 
ACTION.  HE SHOWED US AN UNCONFIRMED AND UNRELIABLE MEDIA

BSA, SARINIC CONTINUED.  THE WATER PIPELINE TO HERCEG-NOVI 
IN MONTENEGRO HAD BEEN PARTIALLY DESTROYED IN THIS 
SHELLING AND THE GOC COULD NOT REPAIR IT UNTIL THE 
SHELLING STOPPED.  SARINIC SAID THE GOC WOULD NOT 
\"BLACKMAIL\" THE SERBS WITH WATER.  AS IN SECTOR EAST, THE 
HV WOULD NOT REACT TO SUCH PROVOCATIONS UNLESS THE SERBS 
MADE GOOD ON THEIR CLAIMS TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE HISTORICAL 
CENTER OF DUBROVNIK.  IT WAS NOT IN CROATIAN INTERESTS TO 
OPEN ANOTHER FRONT, HE REITERATED.

NAMED GENERAL CERMAK 
 AS THE \"KNIN COMMANDER\" AND HAD ASKED 
HIM TO CONSOLIDATE POLITICAL-MILITARY CONTROL OF THE 
SECTORS.  SARINIC SAID AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF THIS POSITION 
WOULD BE FORTHCOMING LATER TODAY.  (NOTE: IT WAS NOT

THE SPOKESMAN, GENERAL IVAN TOLJ, CONFIRMED THAT BENKOVAC 
HAD FALLEN AT 17:55.  HE SAID THE HV OPERATION WAS 
PROCEEDING TWICE AS FAST AS THEY HAD EXPECTED AND THAT 
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE TASK HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.   THE HV 
HAD CUT SEVERAL SERB COMMUNICATION LINES (DRNIS-KNIN, 
OBROVAC-GRACAC, GOSPIC-LJUBOVO, GOSPIC-GRACAC, AND DUBICA- 
KOSTAJNICA).  THE HV HAD ENGAGED THE FORCES OF THE 7TH 
KNIN CORPS (10,000 TROOPS) AND 15TH ILJICKI CORPS (15,000 
TROOPS) IN THE SOUTH, AND THE 21ST AND 39TH CORPS IN THE 
NORTH.  TOLJ OPINED THAT \"TODAY WAS AN HISTORICAL DAY FOR 
CROATIA, EUROPE AND THE WORLD.\" 
 
19.  REFUSING TO GIVE NUMBERS, TOLJ INSISTED THAT THE HV 
HAD SUFFERED MINIMAL CASUALTIES, AND DID NOT HAVE 
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY SERB TROOPS HAD FLED TO BOSNIA. 
THE HV COMMANDER IN OGULIN TOLD POLOFF AND DATT THAT 40 
PERCENT OF HIS CASUALTIES WERE CAUSED BY MINEFIELDS.  HE 
CONFIRMED THAT SERB GUERRILLA ACTIONS CONTINUED IN THE 
SLUNJ AREA OF SECTOR NORTH, BUT INSISTED THAT THE HV WAS 
UNCONCERNED THAT THE \"ARSK\" AND THE BSA MIGHT LAUNCH A 
COUNTER-OFFENSIVE FROM BOSNIA IN THE COMING DAYS.  HE 
REPEATED SARINIC\'S ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF THE DANISH 
PEACEKEEPER.  HV FORCES, HE MAINTAINED, WERE UNDER STRICT

CASUALTIES WHILE AVOIDING UN POSITIONS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT 
THE \"ARSK\" WAS MIXING CIVILIANS WITH MILITARY UNITS AS 
THEY RETREATED AND BECAUSE OF THAT HIS UNITS WERE AVOIDING

NOT CONFIRM THAT ALL THE ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN SECTOR NORTH 
HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT, BUT SAID THAT IN THIS QUICKLY CHANGING 
SITUATION, THE \"POSSIBILITIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED\" 
OF SUCH ROCKETS REACHING ZAGREB.  SUCH TARGETING WOULD BE 
\"CRAZY,\" MILITARILY INSIGNIFICANT, AND THEREFORE ONLY A

SUBJECT:  UPDATE NO. 21:  GLINA BECOMES A GHOST TOWN 
 
 
1.  (U) ON AUGUST 9 AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH MADE HIS SECOND 
VISIT TO  \"SECTOR NORTH\" SINCE THE CROATIAN MILITARY 
ACTION.  ONE OF HIS STOPS WAS GLINA, WHERE HE WAS ABLE TO 
OBSERVE THE DESTRUCTION THAT HAD OCCURRED DURING RECENT 
FIGHTING, SPEAK TO A FEW CROATIAN RESIDENTS OF THE TOWN, 
AND DISCUSS THE FUTURE WITH CROATIAN AUTHORITIES. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
OLD DESTRUCTION AND NEW 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR AND A NUMBER OF EMBASSY PERSONNEL 
TRAVELLED TO THE TOWN OF GLINA IN SECTOR NORTH ON AUGUST 
9.  ON THE WAY, AFTER CROSSING WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN 
THE CONFRONTATION LINE, THE EMBASSY VEHICLES PASSED 
THROUGH A SURREAL LANDSCAPE OF DEVASTATED HOUSES AND 
SHATTERED STOREFRONTS THAT LOOKED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE SET 
OF THE OLD \"COMBAT\" TELEVISION SERIES.  EVERY FEW MILES, 
GROUPS OF SOLDIERS COULD BE SEEN LOUNGING INSIDE BOMBED 
OUT BUILDINGS, SHELTERING THEMSELVES FROM THE RAIN. 
 
3.  (U) JUDGING FROM THE GROWTH OF VEGETATION, MOST OF THE 
DESTRUCTION ALONG THE ROAD HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING THE \'91 
WAR.  IN GLINA, HOWEVER, FRESH SCARS FROM MORTAR SHELLS 
AND MACHINE GUN FIRE COULD BE SEEN ON MANY BUILDINGS. 
MOST STRUCTURES WERE INTACT, HOWEVER, AND THERE WERE NO 
SIGNS OF THE FIRE BOMBING THAT HAD BEEN SO PREVALENT ON 
BOTH SIDES DURING THE CONFLICT OF FOUR YEARS AGO. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03045  01 OF 03  101510Z 
 
4.  (U) THE SHOW WINDOWS OF MOST STOREFRONTS HAD BEEN 
SHATTERED AND MUCH OF THE MERCHANDISE (THOUGH BY NO MEANS 
ALL) HAD BEEN LOOTED.  WHETHER THIS HAD OCCURRED AS THE 
RESIDENTS WERE DEPARTING AND GRABBING WHAT THEY COULD, OR 
WHEN THE CROATIAN FORCES FIRST ARRIVED, WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO 
TELL.  THERE WAS CLEARLY NO LOOTING GOING ON WHILE WE WERE 
THERE AND THE CROATIAN MILITARY AND POLICE APPEARED 
DISCIPLINED AND WELL-ORGANIZED. 
 
5.  (U) AT THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE/POST OFFICE, A FEW 
PEOPLE HAD BEGUN SWEEPING UP THE SHATTERED GLASS WHICH 
COVERED THE FLOOR.  WATER DRIPPED IN THROUGH A GAPING 
SHELL HOLE IN THE ROOF.  REPAIRMEN FROM THE CROATIAN 
TELEPHONE COMPANY SAID THE LOCAL PHONE SYSTEM WOULD BE UP 
AND RUNNING THE FOLLOWING DAY AND THE TOWN SHOULD BE 
HOOKED UP TO THE NATIONAL GRID SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  DURING 
THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS, ALL \"RSK\" COMMUNICATION LINES HAD 
RUN THROUGH BELGRADE. 
 
---------------------------------- 
FIRST THE CROATS AND NOW THE SERBS 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) THE TOWN HAD AN EERIE FEEL ABOUT IT, AS ITS 
INHABITANTS HAD APPARENTLY GOTTEN UP AND LEFT IN THE 
MIDDLE OF WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING.  CLOTHES WERE STILL 
HUNG ON THE LINE TO DRY.  ICECREAM WAS MELTING IN 
FREEZERS.  FRESH MEAT COULD BE SEEN SPOILING IN THE 
BUTCHER SHOPS.  (NOTE:  ELECTRIC COMPANY OFFICIALS SAID 
POWER WOULD BE RESTORED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS).  IN A TV 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

REPAIR SHOP A SET WAS DISMANTLED ON THE WORKBENCH.  OTHER 
SETS LINED THE WALLS.  A SMALL DOG WAS COWERING UNDER A 
CHAIR, VAINLY AWAITING THE RETURN OF HIS MASTER. 
 
7.  (U) SOLDIERS ACCOUNTED FOR 90 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE TO 
BE SEEN ON THE STREETS.  THE TOWN\'S POPULATION WAS 6,933 
IN THE 1991 CENSUS.  VIRTUALLY ALL OF GLINA\'S CROATS, 
(ABOUT A THIRD OF THE POPULATION), WERE ETHNICALLY 
CLEANSED DURING THE \'91 WAR.  NOW ITS SERBIAN RESIDENTS 
HAD FLED AS WELL, PANICKED BY THE ADVANCE OF CROATIAN 
TROOPS, LEAVING THE BULK OF THEIR POSSESSIONS BEHIND. 
 
8.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR ENCOUNTERED NO SERBS IN GLINA, BUT 
AMONG THE FEW CIVILIANS WANDERING ABOUT WERE A PAIR OF 
CROATIAN WOMEN.  THEY HAD SOMEHOW MANAGED TO STAY ON AFTER 
THEIR FELLOW CROATS HAD BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE FOUR YEARS 
AGO.  THE ONE WITH WHOM THE AMBASSADOR SPOKE WAS A MIDWIFE 
WHOSE SKILLS WERE PERHAPS NEEDED.  SHE HAD NO COMPLAINTS 
REGARDING HER TREATMENT BY THE SERBS.  SHE SAID THAT SHE 
ALWAYS KNEW THAT THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD EVENTUALLY 
RETURN TO THE REGION.

------------------------------ 
A PRIEST RETURNS TO HIS PARISH 
------------------------------ 
 
9.  (U) WE HAD A CHANCE ENCOUNTER WITH THE LOCAL CATHOLIC 
PRIEST, RETURNED TO HIS PARISH FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
BEING FORCED TO LEAVE ON JULY 14, 1991.  AS HE WANDERED 
THROUGH THE ROOMS OF HIS FORMER RECTORY, HE POINTED OUT 
ITEMS THAT HAD APPEARED SINCE HE HAD LEFT; A POSTER OF THE 
BELGRADE \"RED STAR\" SOCCER TEAM, A PICTURE OF SERBIAN 
LEADER SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC. 
 
10.  (U) A FAMILY HAD CLEARLY BEEN LIVING IN THE HOUSE UP 
TO A FEW DAYS BEFORE.  THE GARDEN WAS PLANTED WITH 
VEGETABLES.  CHILDREN\'S TOYS LAY SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR. 
A HALF EATEN BOX OF COOKIES WAS ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER. 
THE FACT THAT THE PLACE HAD BEEN INHABITED PROBABLY 
EXPLAINS WHY IT HAD BEEN SPARED THE FATE OF MOST CROAT- 
OWNED BUILDINGS. 
 
11.  (U) THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ACROSS THE PARK HAD NOT BEEN 
SO LUCKY.  IN WHAT AT FIRST GLANCE APPEARED TO BE AN EMPTY 
LOT, THE OUTLINES OF THE CHURCH\'S FOUNDATION COULD JUST 
BARELY BE MADE OUT.  EXCEPT FOR THE TWISTED REMAINS OF A 
WROUGHT IRON GATE, NOTHING ELSE REMAINED, INCLUDING AN 
ALTAR WHICH HAD BEEN SALVAGED FROM THE ZAGREB CATHEDRAL 
AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE LAST CENTURY.  THE PARISH 
PRIEST SAID HE HAD PREVIOUSLY MINISTERED TO A CONGREGATION 
OF 2.500 PEOPLE. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

12.  (U) A LITTLE FARTHER DOWN THE STREET, AT THE ORTHODOX 
CHURCH A SHELL HAD LANDED NEARBY AND BLASTED A HOLE 
THROUGH THE WALL SHATTERING SOME OF THE WINDOWS.  HOWEVER, 
THE ALTAR AND ICONOSTASIS REMAINED UNDAMAGED.  THERE WERE 
NO SIGNS OF VANDALISM.  A CROATIAN POLICEMAN WAS STATIONED 
OUT FRONT TO PREVENT LOOTING. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
\"WE WILL NOT TREAT THEM AS THEY HAVE TREATED US\" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
13.  (U) WE SPOKE TO A COUPLE OF SOLDIERS ORIGINALLY FROM 
THE GLINA AREA.  THEY SAID A MAJORITY OF THE SOLDIERS WE 
SAW WERE FROM THE AREA AND THEY EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO 
REMAIN NOW THAT THE TOWN HAD BEEN RETAKEN.  THE HOUSE OF 
ONE HAD BEEN DESTROYED.  THE HOUSE OF THE OTHER WAS STILL 
INTACT BECAUSE, HE SAID, A SERBIAN FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING 
THERE. 
 
14.  (U) IN TALKING TO US THEY EMPHASIZED THAT SERB 
PROPERTY WOULD NOT BE DESTROYED AND SERBS WHO HAD NOT BEEN 
GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES OR ETHNIC CLEANSING WERE WELCOME TO 
RETURN.  \"WE ARE A CIVILIZED, WESTERN SOCIETY,\" THEY 
INSISTED.  \"WE WILL NOT TREAT THEM AS THEY HAVE TREATED 
US.\"

15.  (C) THE WAY THE POLICEMEN SPOKE GAVE THE IMPRESSION 
THAT THEY HAD TAKEN SOME PAINS TO LEARN THE \"PARTY LINE.\" 
CLEARLY THAT WAS NOT THE CASE IN SISAK WHERE, REPORTEDLY, 
THE PEOPLE HURLED BRICKS AND INSULTS AT DEPARTING SERBS 
AND THE POLICE STOOD BY AND DID NOTHING TO PREVENT IT. 
(NOTE:  THE AMBASSADOR IS TRAVELLING TO SISAK AUGUST 10 TO 
OBSERVE, AND IF POSSIBLE PREVENT, FURTHER SUCH INCIDENTS.) 
 
16.  (C) IT WAS PREDICTED THAT MOST SERBS WOULD FLEE THE 
KRAJINA IF CROATIA TOOK MILITARY ACTION.  FROM WHAT WE 
HAVE HEARD AND OBSERVED IN PLACES LIKE PETRINJA, KNIN, AND 
GLINA, THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE EVIDENCE OF ATROCITIES 
OR PEOPLE BEING FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES BY CROATIAN 
FORCES.  MORE TYPICALLY THEY FLED BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF 
CROATIAN TROOPS OR WERE ORDERED TO LEAVE BY \"RSK\" 
AUTHORITIES. 
 
17.  (C) HOWEVER, THE FOCUS WILL NOW TURN TO WHETHER THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT CREATES THE CONDITIONS THAT WILL 
ENCOURAGE THESE PEOPLE TO RETURN TO THEIR ANCESTRAL HOMES.

3.  (C) POLOFFS MET WITH THE DANISH UN COMMANDER, COL. 
JASPER HELSOE (PROTECT), AND CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICER RUS 
BALLANTYNE (PROTECT) AT BANBAT HQ IN CORALICI.  THEY 
COMPLAINED THAT THE UN SAFE AREA POLICY WAS GROSSLY 
INADEQUATE IN THE CASE OF BIHAC, WHERE ONLY THE TOWN WAS 
PROTECTED, BUT THE ENTIRE POCKET WAS IN RANGE OF SERB 
GUNS.  THEY NOTED THAT THE POWER STATION AND WATER

FREQUENTLY TARGETED 
 
4.  (U) BOTH STRESSED THAT IT WAS ALL THEY COULD DO TO 
MANAGE THE VARIOUS FLOWS OF DISPLACED PERSONS IN THE 
CANTON THAT HAVE OCCURRED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE

THAT ANY TIME SHELLING STARTED, LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE

SERVICES AND SUPPLIES.  THEY ESTIMATED THAT 20 PERCENT OF 
THE AREA\'S POPULATION FLED FROM ABDIC CONTROLLED TERRITORY 
TOWARD THE SOUTH.  ABDIC\'S \"REPUBLIC OF WESTERN BOSNIA\" 
ALSO CONTAINED ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF THE AVAILABLE FARM 
LAND.  AS A RESULT, LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE FORCED TO FEED 
MORE PEOPLE FROM LESS LAND.  THIS PROBLEM, COUPLED WITH 
THE INABILITY OF AID CONVOYS TO REACH THE POCKET, HAS 
CREATED A CONTINUING PROBLEM FOR LOCAL OFFICIALS TRYING TO 
SUSTAIN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.  PRODUCE WAS OFTEN 
CONSUMED BEFORE THE HARVEST AND LITTLE WAS RESERVED TO 
PROVIDE SEEDS FOR THE NEXT PLANTING. 
 
5.  (U) THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT 40,000 DP\'S IN THE BIHAC 
POCKET, AND PROBABLY BETWEEN 15-20,000 REFUGEES LOYAL TO 
FIKRET ABDIC (AND POSSIBLY ALSO INCLUDING \"RSK\" SERBS) ON 
THE ROAD NEAR THE VILLAGE OF KRSTINJA IN CROATIA.  HELSOE 
HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL AT OBTAINING CLEARANCE FROM THE GOC 
TO VISIT THESE PEOPLE THE DAY BEFORE (SIMILAR PROBLEMS 
WITH ACCESS HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY UNHCR AND ICRC, SEPTEL). 
HELSOE SAID HE NEEDED BOTH ACCESS TO THE REFUGEES FROM THE

VELIKA KLADUSA.  THE UN NEEDS TO HELP ESTABLISH THE 
CREDIBILITY OF THE GOBH WITH REFUGEES WHO ARE SCARED OF 
RETRIBUTION.  THERE ARE RUMORS AMONG THE REFUGEES THAT 100 
ABDIC FOLLOWERS ARE STILL IN JAIL IN BIHAC FROM LAST YEAR, 
WHEN THE GOBH OFFERED AN AMNESTY (NOTE: CANTON OFFICIALS 
CONFIRMED TO US THAT THERE ARE SOME ABDIC FOLLOWERS STILL 
IN JAIL UNDER WAR CRIMES CHARGES.)  THE UN WOULD LIKE GOBH 
OFFICIALS, POSSIBLY AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL, TO TALK TO 
THE REFUGEES AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME BACK. 
 
6.  (U) WE HEARD FROM BOTH THE UN AND CANTON OFFICIALS 
THAT A DEAL FOR RETURNING THE ABDIC REFUGEES TO VELIKA 
KLADUSA HAD BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOC, GOBH, ABDIC, AND 
REFUGEE REPRESENTATIVES, EFFECTIVE AUGUST 11.  IN AN 
ASIDE, GOBH OFFICIALS OPINED THAT ABDIC MUST BE IN CROATIA 
IF HE HAD SIGNED THE AGREEMENT.  (NOTE: WHEN ATTEMPTING TO 
PASS THROUGH THE REFUGEES ON OUR RETURN FROM BIHAC WE WERE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

TOLD BY PEOPLE ON THE ROAD THAT ABDIC WAS PERSONALLY 
LEADING THE COLUMN.  WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET TO THE HEAD 
OF THE COLUMN TO TRY TO FIND ABDIC BECAUSE REFUGEES WERE 
BLOCKING THE ROAD AND WE HAD TO FIND AN ALTERNATE ROUTE.)

AND THE NEXT MILITARY MOVES 
--------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) UN OFFICIALS IN CORALICI NOTED THAT AS A RESULT OF 
THE HV DEFEAT OF THE \"ARSK,\" THE PRESSURE ON BIHAC\'S 
NORTHERN BORDER WAS RELIEVED AND V CORPS COULD REDIRECT 
ABOUT 10-12,000 TROOPS TO THE FRONT LINE WITH THE BSA. 
ACCORDING TO THE UN, V CORPS NOW HAS A \"LIFETIME\" SUPPLY 
OF AMMUNITION (BALLANTYNE NOTED THAT ON ONE OCCASION HE 
SAW TEN 10 TON TRUCKS MOVING SOUTH CARRYING AMMO AND 
WEAPONS FOR V CORPS), AT LEAST FOUR TANKS, APC\'S, AND 
ARTILLERY TAKEN FROM ABDIC\'S \"REPUBLIC OF WESTERN BOSNIA.\" 
V CORPS IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SOUTH AND EAST AND EXPECTS TO 
TAKE PRIJEDOR.  THE UN CITED RUMORS THAT THE HVO AND V 
CORPS HAVE ALREADY LINKED UP AT KULEN VAKUF, ABOUT 30 
KILOMETERS SOUTHEAST OF BIHAC ON THE CROATIAN BORDER.

CANTON GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES - AID NEEDS

8.  (U)  IN BIHAC TOWN, THE DELEGATION MET WITH CANTON 
GOVERNOR VELADZIC, PRESIDENT OF THE CANTON GOVERNMENT 
FERIZOVIC, AND CANTON PARLIAMENT PRESIDENT ADEM BORIC. 
ALL THREE WERE EUPHORIC THAT THE CANTON HAD FINALLY BEEN

REMAINED INSTEAD OF FOUR, FERIZOVIC OFTEN REPEATED.  EVEN 
SO, ALL AREAS OF THE CANTON STILL REMAINED WITHIN REACH OF 
BSA HEAVY WEAPONS.  BIHAC SAFE AREA WAS SHELLED REGULARLY, 
RECEIVING 6 SHELLS LATE ON AUGUST 9.   THE GOVERNOR 
OUTLINED A LONG WISH LIST OF ITEMS THAT THE AREA 
DESPERATELY NEEDED. HE WAS CRITICAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY\'S LACK OF IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THE CHANGING 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION.  FIVE DAYS AFTER ITS LIBERATION, 
ONLY A \"SYMBOLIC QUANTITY\" OF ASSISTANCE HAD ARRIVED 
DESPITE OPEN ROADS FROM CROATIA, VELADZIC INSISTED. 
(NOTE:  THE QUICKEST ROUTE FROM ZAGREB TO VELIKA KLADUSA, 
THROUGH VOJNIC, WAS BLOCKED IN CROATIA ON AUGUST 11 BY 
FLEEING COLUMNS OF REFUGEES LOYAL TO OPPORTUNISTIC MUSLIM 
LEADER FIKRET ABDIC.  SEE SEPTEL.  END NOTE.) 
 
9.  (U)  ONLY ONE CONVOY HAD ARRIVED IN THE AREA FOR 13 
MONTHS, FERIZOVIC STATED  THE POCKET\'S POPULATION HAD 
BEEN CUT OFF FOR FOUR YEARS AND EVERYONE INSIDE, EITHER IN 
THEIR OWN HOME OR DISPLACED, SUFFERED EQUALLY.  VELADZIC\'S

ALTHOUGH NINETY PERCENT MUSLIM, THE CANTON WELCOMED ALL 
NATIONALITIES.  HE STRESSED THAT A GENERAL AMNESTY WOULD 
BE GRANTED FOR EVERYONE WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, 
BUT WAR CRIMINALS (PARTICULARLY ABDIC) WOULD BE PURSUED. 
FERIZOVIC SAID THAT THERE IS EXTREMELY GOOD COOPERATION 
WITH THE CROATIAN POPULATION WHICH COULD BE AN EXAMPLE FOR 
THE REST OF BOSNIA.  (THIS POINT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY 
BALLANTYNE, WHO NOTED THERE IS AN HVO BRIGADE WITH V 
CORPS.)  IT WAS PROUDLY NOTED THAT THE CANTONAL GOVERNMENT 
WAS FORMED IN 15 DAYS AFTER THE MAY 27 MEETING OF THE 
LOCAL PARLIAMENT.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT MINISTERS COME FROM 
BOTH THE DOMINANT MUSLIM SDA AND ALSO THE CROAT HDZ.

RETURNED THAT SAME DAY TO CHECK ON HER PROPERTY.  IT HAD 
BEEN LIBERATED ONLY DAYS BEFORE.  IN THE MUSLIM VILLAGE OF

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  SENATORS WARNER AND KERREY WERE BRIEFED IN KNIN IN 
THE UN COMPOUND BY LOCAL UNCRO MILITARY OFFICERS AND 
OBSERVERS, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER, 
THE EC MONITORING MISSION AND UNHCR.  THE UN AND ECMM 
ASSESSMENTS OF THE ATTACK AND AFTERMATH OF THE HV\'S 
\"OPERATION STORM\" WERE BLUNT AND FEATURED DISTURBING 
ALLEGATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, 
INCLUDING LARGE-SCALE BURNING OF SERB HOMES AND VILLAGES, 
SOME APPARENT MURDERS OF CIVILIANS AND PROBLEMS WITH 
DISPLACED PERSONS.  WARNER AND KERREY ALSO MET BRIEFLY 
WITH GENERAL CERMAK, CROATIAN MILITARY GOVERNOR OF KNIN, 
AND DISCUSSED CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE AREA AND THE PLIGHT OF 
DISPLACED PERSONS IN THE WAKE OF MILITARY OPERATIONS.

MILITARY ASPECTS OF \"STORM\" 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  THE OPENING MILITARY ASSESSMENT BY LOCAL UNCRO 
COMMANDER FOURAND AND HIS BRIEFER, COLONEL BALFOUR (BOTH 
CANADIAN OFFICERS), POSITED THAT CROATIAN FORCES (HV) 
WERE SUCCESSFUL NOT BECAUSE OF MILITARY PROWESS (BALFOUR 
CHARACTERIZED SOME HV TROOPS IN KNIN AS \"A MOTLEY 
COLLECTION OF THUGS\") BUT BECAUSE OF THE \"RSK\" 
LEADERSHIP\'S EARLY DECISION TO ORDER EVACUATION RATHER 
THAN MOUNT A SUSTAINED DEFENSIVE CAMPAIGN.  FOURAND AND 
BALFOUR NOTED THAT THE TERRAIN OF FORMER UN SECTOR SOUTH 
IS \"A DEFENDER\'S DREAM\" AND THAT EVEN MARGINALLY 
EFFECTIVE \"RSK\" COMMAND AND TACTICS COULD HAVE BOGGED HV 
ATTACKERS DOWN IN A PROLONGED, DEBILITATING FIGHT. 
 
3.  SENATOR KERREY CHALLENGED THE VIEW THAT THE HV\'S 
OPERATION WAS A SUCCESS ONLY BY DEFAULT, NOTING THE 
EXTREMELY RAPID AND COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF THE SERB 
DEFEAT.  BALFOUR REPEATED THAT THE \"RSK\" DECISION TO 
EVACUATE REMAINED THE KEY REASON FOR THE CROATIAN 
VICTORY, AND FURTHER NOTED THE HV OPERATION IN SECTOR 
SOUTH INVOLVED LITTLE INGENUITY AND MIRRORED EARLIER 
\"RSK\" AND BSA TACTICS:  I.E., STAND OFF AND HAMMER THE 
ENEMY\'S MILITARY AND CIVILIAN CENTERS WITH ARTILLERY -- 
THE UN CLAIMED OVER 2,000 IMPACTS IN KNIN CITY -- THEN 
MOVE IN TO TAKE CONTROL OF SURRENDERED OR DESERTED AREAS.

(COMMENT: THE CENTER OF KNIN SHOWED LITTLE DAMAGE, BUT 
THE UN CLAIMS THE HV UNDERTOOK A CLEAN-UP OF THE AREA 
DURING THE PERIOD OF AUGUST 5-8, WHILE THE UN WAS STILL 
CONFINED TO ITS COMPOUND.  THE CITY HAD ALSO BEEN SPRUCED 
UP AUGUST 26 FOR PRESIDENT TUDJMAN\'S REOPENING OF THE 
ZAGREB-KNIN-SPLIT RAILROAD.  END COMMENT.)  THE UNCRO 
OFFICERS AND THE MILITARY OBSERVER ALSO CLAIMED THAT THE 
HV AT ONE POINT THREATENED DIRECT ATTACK ON THE UN 
COMPOUND IN KNIN AND GAVE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF HV ATTACKS 
ON UN OBERVATION POSTS (THERE WERE TWO UN CASUALTIES) AND 
OF HV ADVANCES THAT \"WENT NOWHERE\" WHEN SERB TROOPS 
OFFERED MEANINGFUL RESISTENCE.

4.  THE MOST DRAMATIC AND DISTURBING BRIEFINGS DEALT WITH 
REPORTS FROM THE EC MONITORING MISSION AND UN HUMAN 
RIGHTS CENTER REPRESENTATIVES THAT THE HV OR OTHER CROAT 
ELEMENTS HAD ENGAGED IN SIGNIFICANT HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF \"STORM,\" INCLUDING WIDE- 
SPREAD BURNING OF SERB HOMES AND VILLAGES AND SOME 
APPARENT MURDERS OF CIVILIANS. 
 
5.  BURNINGS:  THE ECMM MONITOR, SOREN LIBORIUS, 
ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST 60 PERCENT OF FORMERLY SERB 
DWELLINGS HAD BEEN BURNED FROM AUGUST 7 THROUGH AUGUST 
24, AND SUPPLIED A WRITTEN REPORT DOCUMENTING DOZENS OF 
SPECIFIC INCIDENTS.  IN SOME INSTANCES, ECMM MONITORS 
OBSERVED HOUSES BEING BURNT BY UNIFORMED HV SOLDIERS 
SUPPLIED BY FUEL TRUCKS IN AREAS UNDER HV OR POLICE 
CONTROL.  IN OTHER INSTANCES, MIXED GROUPS OF CIVILIANS 
AND MILITARY PERSONNEL WERE SEEN BURNING HOUSES.  WHILE 
ECMM AND THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS REPS ATTRIBUTED SOME 
BURNINGS TO INCIDENTS OF INDIVIDUAL RETRIBUTION OR 
THUGGERY, THEY BELIEVED THERE MAY EXIST AN ORGANIZED

CROATIAN EFFORT TO DEPRIVE WOULD-BE SERB RETURNEES OF 
HABITATION.  THEY OBSERVED A WIDE PATTERN OF DESTRUCTION 
OF REMOTE SERB HOMES AND VILLAGES WHILE TRADITIONAL 
CROATIAN VILLAGES AS WELL AS LARGER POPULATION CENTERS 
(E.G., KNIN, VRILKA, DRNIS) WERE SPARED, POSSIBLY AS 
POTENTIAL HOUSING FOR RETURNING CROATIANS DISPLACED IN 
1991-92.  (COMMENT:  IN ADDITION TO THE UN AND ECMM 
COMMENTS, EMBOFFS WITH WARNER AND KERREY SAW SEVERAL 
RECENTLY BURNED HOUSES AND VILLAGES IN THE AREA OF KNIN. 
APPROXIMATELY 80 - 90 PERCENT OF BUILDINGS ALONG THE ROAD 
THROUGH DRNIS - KNIN - VRPOLJE - KIJEVO HAD BEEN BURNED. 
EMBOFFS SAW TWO FIRES IN DRNIS AND OTHERS ALONG THE ROAD. 
IN SOME AREAS THE AIR SMELLED OF RECENTLY-BURNED 
BUILDINGS.  END COMMENT.) 
 
6.  KILLINGS:  IN ADDITION TO HOUSE-BURNING INCIDENTS, 
THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER REPRESENTATIVE, E.J. FLYNN, 
AND THE ECMM REP RECOUNTED CHILLING CASES OF APPARENT 
MURDER OF UNARMED SERBS AFTER THE CROATIAN MILITARY 
OPERATION WAS COMPLETE.  IN ONE INSTANCE IN A REMOTE 
RURAL AREA, A CANADIAN UN OFFICER OBSERVED HV SOLDIERS 
POSING FOR A PHOTO WITH AN ELDERLY SERB, \"DISPLAYING HIM 
LIKE A HUNTING TROPHY.\"  SOME TIME LATER, THE SERB WAS 
FOUND IN A NEARBY FIELD WITH A BULLET IN HIS HEAD.  IN

WISHED TO QUESTION 62 MEN IN THE GROUP FOR POSSIBLE WAR 
CRIMES.  HE INSISTED THAT CROATIA HAD DOSSIERS ON THE

OTHERS WERE FREE TO DEPART, BUT SOME WERE RELATIVES OF 
THE 62 MEN AND WERE UNWILLING TO DEPART WITHOUT THEM.

DURING THE AKASHI-SARINIC TALKS, THE GOC AGREED TO NARROW

THAT THEY EXPECT TO BEGIN MOVING REFUGEES ABOUT 48 HOURS 
AFTER THE AGREEMENT IS FORMALIZED.  (IT IS NOT YET KNOWN

2. UNCRO DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF POLITICAL OPERATIONS UK COL. 
WILLIAMS PULLED DCM ASIDE SEPTEMBER 13 AT A BRIEFING FOR 
THE NEW UN HUMANITARIAN CRISIS CELL, SET UP IN RESPONSE 
TO THE PROBLEMS OF CIVILIAN POPULATIONS IN CROATIA AND 
BOSNIA.  WILLIAMS POINTED OUT THAT HV AND HVO GAINS OF 
THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE CREATED A LARGE AREA IN WESTERN 
BOSNIA THAT IS EFFECTIVELY DEVOID OF UN OBSERVER 
PRESENCE, AND WHICH MAY BECOME THE SOURCE OF NEW LARGE 
NUMBERS OF REFUGEES. 
 
3. THE FRONT, ACCORDING TO GOC CLAIMS, NOW RUNS ALONG A 
LINE FROM TITOV DRVAR EAST INCLUDING SIPOVO NEARLY TO 
JAJCE. BOSNIAN SERB LEADER KARADZIC CONFIRMED ON 
TELEVISION SEPTEMBER 12 THAT SIPOVO WAS OCCUPIED. 
ACCORDING TO WILLIAMS, UNCRO OBSERVERS ARE NOT ALLOWED 
NORTH OF THE LIVNO-PROZOR ROAD FROM THE SOUTH, AND ARE 
DENIED ACCESS TO BOSNIA FROM THEIR FOUR OBSERVATION POSTS 
LOCATED IN FORMER SECTORS NORTH AND SOUTH OF CROATIA. 
UNPROFOR FORCES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS FROM THE EAST. 
 
4. THIS MEANS THERE ARE NO UN OBSERVERS PRESENT IN A 
LARGE SWATH OF TERRITORY.  WILLIAMS ESTIMATED THAT 20,000 
NEW REFUGEES MAY SHORTLY EMERGE FROM JAJCE AND SAID THAT 
PAST CROATIAN ACTIONS IN SECTORS NORTH AND SOUTH CAUSE 
FEARS THAT HOSTILE ACTS AGAINST CIVILIANS WILL TAKE PLACE 
IN THE NEWLY \'REINTEGRATED\' AREAS OF BOSNIA AS WELL. 
WILLIAMS SPECULATED THAT THE CROATS MAY CONTINUE TOWARDS 
BANJA LUKA AND CAUSE A ROUT OF SERBS IN WESTERN BOSNIA.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  DEPUTY PM KOSTOVIC TOLD VISITING DRL A/S SHATTUCK THAT 
THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO REPATRIATE THE 
20,000 ABDIC REBEL MUSLIMS IN THE KUPLJENSKO CAMP NEAR 
VOJNIC AFTER 10-15 DAYS IF NO AGREEMENT IS REACHED IN THE 
INTERIM FOR THEIR RETURN.  CROATIA, BOSNIA, AND TURKEY 
WOULD PROVIDE AN INTERNATIONAL POLICE FORCE TO PROVIDE FOR 
THEIR SAFETY.  KOSTOVIC REQUESTED USG ASSISTANCE TO 
PRESSURE THE GOBH TO PROVIDE GUARANTEES FOR THEIR SAFE 
RETURN.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE REVOCATION OF REFUGEE STATUS 
DECREE FOR BOSNIANS FROM THE FEDERATION AND THE NEWLY 
LIBERATED TERRITORIES WOULD NOT FORCIBLY REPATRIATE THEM, 
BUT \"ONLY\" CUT OFF THEIR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  HOWEVER, 
HE ADDED THAT WHILE ETHNIC CROAT DUAL NATIONALS WOULD BE 
LEGALLY ALLOWED TO STAY, OTHERS (MUSLIMS FROM B-H) WOULD 
NOT BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN.  KOSTOVIC AGREED TO WORK WITH 
GRANIC TO SET UP A NEW PROCEDURE IN THE BELGRADE MISSION 
OF THE GOC FOR SERBS TO APPLY TO RETURN.  END SUMMARY.

3.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER DR. IVICA KOSTOVIC, WHO IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REINTEGRATED TERRITORIES, TOLD DRL A/S 
JOHN SHATTUCK ON SEPTEMBER 30 THAT, AT A NATIONAL SECURITY 
COUNCIL MEETING EARLIER THAT MORNING, THE GOC HAD MADE THE 
POLITICAL DECISION TO REPATRIATE THE 20,000 ABDIC MUSLIMS 
AT THE KUPLJENSKO CAMP WITHIN THE NEXT 10-15 DAYS.  (NOTE: 
THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN REFUGEE STATUS BY THE GOC 
BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT VELIKA KLADUSA IS A SAFE PLACE TO 
RETURN.  END NOTE.)  WINTERIZING THE CAMP WAS NOT AN 
OPTION THE GOC WOULD CONSIDER.  THE GOC HAD AGREED TO A 
TRIPARTITE TURKISH, BOSNIAN, AND CROATIAN POLICE FORCE AND 
A TURKISH OMBUDSMAN TO MONITOR THE SECURITY OF THE TOWN. 
THE GOC ALREADY HAD THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO REMOVE THE 
ARMED MEN IN THE CAMP AND WOULD SOON DO SO.  KOSTOVIC 
CLAIMED THAT ALL BUT 400-1200 OF THE REFUGEES WOULD 
RETURN IF THE GOBH WERE TO ISSUE AN AMNESTY AND PROVIDE 
FOR THEIR RETURN.  (COMMENT:  THIS VIEW WAS SHARED BY 
SOME, BUT NOT ALL, UNHCR OFFICIALS AT KUPLJENSKO, DURING 
A/S SHATTUCK\'S VISIT THERE SEPTEMBER 29.  THE REFUGEES 
THEMSELVES, HOWEVER, CONTENDED AN AMNESTY ALONE WOULD BE 
INSUFFICIENT, UNTIL THE WAR IN BOSNIA WAS OVER.) 
 
4.  A/S SHATTUCK EMPHASIZED THAT THIS DECISION POSED 
SERIOUS CONCERNS FOR THE USG AND COULD DEVELOP INTO AN 
EXPLOSIVE SITUATION.  HE URGED THE GOC TO RECONSIDER ANY 
FORCED REPATRIATION AND TO WORK WITH THE GOBH TO PROVIDE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03839  01 OF 03  022002Z 
GUARANTEES FOR THEIR RETURN.  KOSTOVIC RESPONDED THAT 
CROATIA HAD A STRATEGIC INTEREST IN ENSURING THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NON-FUNDAMENTALIST, PEACEFUL ENTITY AT 
ITS BORDER.  THE GOC HAD ACCEPTED REQUESTS FROM SOME OF 
THE SOLDIERS TO JOIN THE HVO AS A WAY TO PROMOTE THEIR 
REINTEGRATION. 
 
5.  KOSTOVIC TOOK THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY\'S POINT AND WAS 
CONCERNED ABOUT AVOIDING A HUMAN CATASTROPHE.  \"I WAS 
AGAINST USING FORCE.  OTHER MINISTERS FELT DIFFERENTLY.\" 
KOSTOVIC PROMISED TO RAISE THE ISSUE WITH PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MISETIC AND WARN THEM OF 
ITS POTENTIAL DANGERS.  \"WE HAVEN\'T HAD GOOD COOPERATION 
WITH THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT\" ON THIS ISSUE.  HE REQUESTED 
USG ASSISTANCE TO PRESSURE THE GOBH TO SOON PROVIDE NEW, 
WRITTEN GUARANTEES FOR THE SAFE RE 
TURN OF THESE PEOPLE.

SUBJECT:  DEPUTY PM TELLS A/S SHATTUCK GOC PLANS TO

          ASSISTANCE TO BOSNIAN REFUGEES 
 
STATUS FOR PEOPLE FROM THE FEDERATION AND NEWLY LIBERATED 
TERRITORIES WILL AFFECT ONLY THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OF 
THESE REFUGEES, KOSTOVIC SAID.  NO ONE WOULD BE FORCIBLY 
REPATRIATED, HE INSISTED.  THE DIRECTIVE WOULD STOP ALL 
REFUGEE SUPPORT PAYMENTS (DM 7/DAY/PERSON FOR 
ACCOMMODATION), AND PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO 
RETURN HOME.  THE GOC WOULD NOT STOP UNHCR AND OTHER 
AGENCIES FROM PROVIDING CONTINUING SUPPORT.  HE SAID 
\"MOST\" MOST OF THE BOSNIAN REFUGEES IN CROATIA WERE ETHNIC 
CROATS, AND HAD EVERY RIGHT TO MOVE ACROSS THE BORDER 
FREELY.  (COMMENT:  IN FACT, ONLY ABOUT 55 PERCENT ARE.) 
THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT FORCE THEM TO MOVE ANYWHERE.  AS 
CITIZENS, THIS GROUP WOULD LOSE NEITHER ITS HEALTH 
INSURANCE NOR ITS EDUCATION BENEFITS.  HOWEVER, OF THE 
40,000 MUSLIM REFUGEES IN CROATIA, THOSE FROM FEDERATION 
AND LIBERATED TERRITORIES WOULD INDEED LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO 
STAY. 
 
7.  OPERATION MAESTRAL (LIBERATION OF WESTERN BOSNIA) WAS 
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE \"LIVING ROOM\" FOR MUSLIMS AND SPACE 
FOR THE FEDERATION, KOSTOVIC SAID.  THE GOC HAD CONCLUDED 
AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOBH FOR THE RETURN OF PEOPLE, AND 
THE GOBH DID NOT OBJECT TO ACCEPTING ITS PEOPLE.  GERMANY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

WAS RETURNING REFUGEES TO CROATIA UNDER A SIMILAR 
BILATERAL AGREEMENT.  WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH, THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD RECONSIDER THE LIST OF PLACES MARKED SAFE 
FOR RETURN AND WOULD CARRY OUT THE DIRECTIVE ON A \"STEP- 
BY-STEP\" BASIS.  KOSTOVIC ASSERTED THAT CROATIA UNDERSTOOD 
ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND WOULD ADHERE 
TO THEM.  HE OPINED THAT JAJCE AND GLAMOC WERE PROBABLY 
SAFE ENOUGH TO RETURN TO UNDER THIS DECREE.  HOWEVER, 
GRAHOVO WAS DESTROYED AND HAD NO INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT 
RETURNING REFUGEES. 
 
8.  A/S SHATTUCK UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING 
OPEN THE OPTION OF THIRD COUNTRY RESETTLEMENT, AND OF 
BUILDING MORE FACILITIES WITH INTERNATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS 
TO HOUSE REFUGEES RATHER THAN RETURN PEOPLE TO FRONT-LINE 
AREAS.  KOSTOVIC ANSWERED THAT NO THIRD COUNTRY HAD 
OFFERED TO ACCEPT PERMANENT REFUGEES FROM CROATIA OR 
SERBIA, ONLY BOSNIA.  BOTH SWEDEN AND DENMARK WERE 
RETURNING CROAT REFUGEES, AND THE SHEER NUMBERS OF THOSE 
RETURNING FROM GERMANY HAD PLACED SEVERE FINANCIAL AND 
OTHER DIFFICULTIES ON CROATIA.  JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
HAD OFFERED TO BUILD MORE SHELTERS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAD 
DECIDED TO INTEGRATE DPS AND REFUGEES INTO SOCIETY AS MUCH 
AS POSSIBLE AND WOULD BUILD NO MORE BARRACKS OR TENT 
CITIES.  \"WE DON\'T NEED SHELTERS, WE NEED CASH,\" KOSTOVIC 
DECLARED.  HE CLAIMED THAT CROATIA HAD RECEIVED NO 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL HELP FOR THIS PURPOSE SINCE 1992.

9.  SHATTUCK INSISTED THAT CROATIA MUST ALLOW FOR THE 
RETURN OF ITS SERBIAN RESIDENTS.  INTERNATIONAL 
PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE COMMITMENT OF CROATIA TO A MULTI- 
ETHNIC SOCIETY WOULD TURN ON THE RETURN OF CROATIAN SERBS. 
SUCH A RETURN HAD TWO IMPEDIMENTS: THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE 
OF HOSTILITY IN THE KRAJINA AND THE CONFISCATION OF SERB 
PROPERTY WITHOUT COMPENSATION. 
 
10.  KOSTOVIC ACKNOWLEDGED THESE IMPEDIMENTS, BUT SAID THE 
SECOND COULD NOT BE CHANGED.  UNTIL THE PARLIAMENT WAS 
ELECTED AT THE END OF THE MONTH, IT WAS LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE 
TO CHANGE THE PROPERTY LAW.  HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO WISH 
AMONG THE SERBS TO RETURN.  MANY HAD LEFT WESTERN SLAVONIA 
LONG AFTER THE MILITARY ACTION HAD ENDED.  SINCE THEN, \"I

2.  SUMMARY:  IN A MEETING WITH CROATIAN INTERIOR MINISTER 
JARNJAK, ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHATTUCK EMPHASIZED CONCERN 
OVER THE GOC\'S FORCED REPATRIATION PLAN, THE CONTINUED 
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE KRAJINA REGION, AND DISCUSSED 
THE VOJNIC REFUGEE SITUATION.  SHATTUCK ALSO ENCOURAGED 
MORE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RIGHT OF RETURN OF ETHNIC 
SERBS TO THEIR HOMES IN CROATIA.   IN DEFENDING CROATIA\'S 
RECORD, JARNJAK CITED EXAMPLES OF CROATIAN SUPPORT FOR 
REFUGEES, PURSUIT OF PERPETRATORS OF CRIMINAL ACTS IN THE 
KRAJINA, AND COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES 
COMMISSION.  HE ALSO AGREED TO PRESS FOR MORE PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS ON RIGHTS OF REFUGEES TO RETURN AND TO RECLAIM 
PROPERTY.  COMMENT. JARNJAK MADE AN UNCONVINCING CASE. END 
COMMENT. END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHATTUCK MET WITH CROATIAN 
INTERIOR MINISTER IVAN JARNJAK AT THE MINISTRY ON 
SEPTEMBER 30.  THE MINISTER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS 
ASSISTANTS MARIJAN BENKO FOR POLICE AFFAIRS AND ZDRAVKO 
ZIDOVEC FOR CIVIL AFFAIRS, PLUS THE HEAD OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT DR. JOSIP BESIC.  DRL

STEVE COFFEY AND DCM (NOTETAKER) ACCOMPANIED MR. SHATTUCK. 
 
4.  SHATTUCK DREW ON REFTEL DEMARCHE IN EXPRESSING USG 
CONCERN OVER THE GOC PLAN TO REPATRIATE REFUGEES AND 
STRESSED THAT THE 1951 CONVENTION ON THE STATUS OF 
REFUGEES PRECLUDES FORCED REPATRIATION. AT THE SAME TIME, 
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE BURDEN THAT CROATIA HAS FACED IN 
CARING FOR REFUGEES, BUT STRESSED U.S. CONCERN THAT 
UNILATERAL ABROGATION OF REFUGEE STATUS WAS A VIOLATION OF 
THE 1951 CONVENTION. 
 
5.  JARNYAK REPLIED THAT CROATIA HOLDS HUMAN RIGHTS ABOVE 
POLITICS AND OTHER MATTERS, BUT THAT HE WAS NOT IN A 
POSITION TO DISCUSS THE REPATRIATION ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS 
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MR. ADALBERT REBIC, HEAD OF THE 
OFFICE FOR DISPLACED PERSONS AND REFUGEES.  HE COULD ONLY 
STATE IN GENERAL AND AS A RULE THAT NO PEOPLE ARE FORCED 
TO RETURN TO AREAS NOT CONSIDERED SAFE. 
 
6.  SHATTUCK RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE RIGHT OF RETURN FOR 
CROATIAN SERB REFUGEES.  SUCH PEOPLE SEEKING TO RETURN 
HAVE BEEN FACING IMPEDIMENTS.  IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE 
MORE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN CROATIA REGARDING THE RIGHT OF 
SERBS TO RETURN, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPEDIMENT IS THE 
CLIMATE OF INSINCERITY.  SHATTUCK ALSO NOTED NUMEROUS 
REPORTS THAT KILLING, BURNING AND LOOTING CONTINUES AND 
THE AMPLE EVIDENCE OF DESTRUCTION HE SAW IN HIS TRAVELS 
THROUGH THE NEWLY LIBERATED AREAS. 
 
7.  SHATTUCK MENTIONED THAT FONMIN GRANIC SAID THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD WELCOME THE RETURN OF SERBS VERY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

MUCH AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD INVESTIGATE ABUSES IF 
THEY WERE BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION.  HE URGED JARNJAK TO 
TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES OF THE 
LOOTING, BURNING AND KILLING. 
 
8.  JARNJAK SAID THE REFUGEES HAVE BEEN RETURNING ONLY 
WHEN THEY FEEL SAFE.  HE POINTED OUT THAT IN THE WAR 
BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND CROATS IN BOSNIA IN 1991, CROATIA HAD 
100,000 MUSLIMS HERE AND THE CROATIAN POLICE PROTECTED 
THOSE REFUGEES.  AS FOR THE CROATIAN SERB REFUGEES, THEIR 
SAFETY IS FULLY GUARANTEED ACCORDING TO CROATIAN LAW AS 
LONG AS THEY ARE CITIZENS OF CROATIA.  IF THEY WISH THEY 
CAN RETURN.  THERE IS ONE REQUIREMENT:  THEY HAVE TO 
REPORT THEIR DESIRE TO RETURN TO THE CROATIAN OFFICE IN 
BELGRADE.  (COMMENT. THERE IS ONE CLERK TO PROCESS ALL 
APPLICATIONS FOR RETURN IN BELGRADE. END COMMENT) 
 
9. THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO INFORMATION SO HAD NO WAY OF 
KNOWING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO RETURN, 
JARNJAK CLAIMED.  HE ALSO ASSERTED THAT ALL THOSE WHO COME 
TO THE BORDER OR BORDER POINTS ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER INTO 
CROATIA.  ONLY ONE OR TWO HUNDRED HAVE COME THIS WAY.

SUBJECT:  A/S SHATTUCK\'S 9/30 MEETING WITH INTERIOR 
          MINISTER 
 
ALLOWED INTO CROATIA. END COMMENT) 
 
10. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN SERBIA OR 
BOSNIA HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE GOC\'S WILLINGNESS TO 
RECEIVE THEM BACK BECAUSE CROATIAN MEDIA IS INACCESSIBLE 
TO THEM. COMMENT. SERBIAN RADIO AND TELEVISION ARE READILY 
AVAILABLE IN CROATIA; THE CONVERSE IS PRESUMABLY TRUE AS 
WELL. END COMMENT.  THE MINISTER SAID THE GOC MADE AN 
APPEAL EVERY HOUR WHEN THE KRAJINA OPERATION BEGAN; NOW IT 
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE REFUGEES.  HE NOTED 
THAT THE INHABITANTS OF SECTOR NORTH AND SOUTH LEFT IN AN 
EXODUS COORDINATED BY THEIR OWN CIVIL AND MILITARY 
AUTHORITIES. 
 
11.  THE MINISTER MAINTAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT LOOKED 
INTO EVERY CASE OF BURNING, LOOTING OR KILLING AND HIS 
ASSISTANT FOR POLICE AFFAIRS MR. BENKO HAD DOSSIERS 
AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION.  HE ADMITTED THERE HAD BEEN 
INDIVIDUAL CASES OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  HE NOTED 
THAT CROATIA HAS COOPERATED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 
TRIBUNAL IN THE HAGUE AND RECEIVED LETTERS OF GRATITUDE 
FROM THEM.  THE SPECIAL SERVICE ACTIVE WITH WAR CRIMES AND 
TERRORISM HAS BEEN WORKING IN CROATIA SINCE 1991.

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03925  02 OF 03  061729Z 
STRESSING THAT THE EXISTING PROCEDURES WERE EXTREMELY 
DIFFICULT FOR THE CROATIAN SERB REFUGEES TO BE ABLE TO 
COMPLY.  THE CITIZENS WHO WANT TO RECLAIM THEIR PROPERTY 
MUST HAVE DOCUMENTS AND PERMANENTLY RESIDE IN CROATIA.  IT 
IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THESE DOCUMENTS OUTSIDE OF CROATIA 
AND DIFFICULT FOR THE REFUGEES TO GET BACK INTO CROATIA. 
IN ADDITION, IN MANY CASES THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN 
DESTROYED.  IN SUMMARY, IT APPEARS THAT DE FACTO THE 
PROPERTY HAS BEEN CONFISCATED.  MAYBE THAT IS NOT THE 
INTENT, BUT THAT IS THE EFFECT. 
 
13.  THE DIRECTIVE ON PROPERTY, ACCORDING TO JARNJAK, IS 
INTENDED TO PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY FROM FURTHER 
DESTRUCTION BY MAKING CROATIA THE TEMPORARY OWNER.  THE 
CROATIAN LAW ON PROPERTY RIGHTS PROVIDES FOR THE RETURN OF 
THE PROPERTY AS SOON AS ITS LEGAL OWNERS RETURN. THE 
PROPERTY OF THOSE WHO DECIDE NOT TO RETURN WILL BE 
UTILIZED FOR THOSE IN NEED, SUCH AS REFUGEES.  THE 
PROPERTY IS NOT GIVEN PERMANENTLY, ONLY PROVIDED FOR USE. 
(COMMENT: THE TITO GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED THOUSANDS OF 
PROPERTIES WHEN IT CAME INTO POWER, AND MANY ORIGINAL 
OWNERS ARE NOW IN LITIGATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO OBTAIN 
THEIR RETURN. END COMMENT) 
 
14.  A/S SHATTUCK NOTED HE HAD PERSONALLY VISITED THE 
VOJNIC REFUGEES.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THERE WILL BE A 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN THE WINTER, BUT THERE IS AN 
IMMEDIATE CRISIS OF SANITATION.  ONE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO 
MOVE THE REFUGEES TO HIGHER GROUND.  IT WOULD BE HELPFUL 
IF THE GOC WORKED WITH UNHCR AND ICRC ON THIS MATTER. 
THERE IS ALSO A SECURITY PROBLEM IN THE CAMP.   IT IS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

AND THAT THE MILITARY ARE TAKING YOUNG MEN. 
 
15.  THIS CAMP IS A LARGE AND SERIOUS PROBLEM, ACCORDING 
TO JARNJAK.  THE INTERIOR MINISTERS OF TURKEY, B-H AND 
CROATIA WILL MEET NEXT WEEK.  THERE WILL BE A THREE PART 
POLICE WITH THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THE PEOPLE IN SUCH A 
WAY THAT THEY CAN RETURN TO VELIKA KLADUSA.  JARNJAK SAID 
HE HOPED IN THIS WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM POSITIVELY. 
HOWEVER, THERE WILL BE NO FORCIBLE RETURN  THE GOC WILL 
SEEK A SOLUTION FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO RETURN. 
JARNJAK ADDED THAT THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT MAKE 
ANY PERSON RETURN TO A POSITION WHERE HE COULD NOT LIVE 
SAFELY AND IN PEACE.  \"IF I HADN\'T BEEN OF THIS 
OPINION. WE WOULD NOT HAVE LET THEM COME TO CROATIA.\" 
(COMMENT. EMBASSY IS REPORTING SEPARATELY ON FORCIBLE 
RETURN OF CROATIANS TO BOSNIA. END COMMENT.)

BETWEEN CROATIA AND THE WAR CRIMES COMMISSION, AND

SUBJECT:  A/S SHATTUCK\'S 9/30 MEETING WITH INTERIOR

GIVEN IS THAT SERBS ARE NOT WELCOME.  JARNJAK SAID BOTH 
TUDJMAN AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAVE SPOKEN TWICE ON THIS 
ISSUE, BUT THAT HE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE PRESIDENT 
ADDRESS IT AGAIN IN HIS NEXT PRESS CONFERENCE, THE 
PROBLEM, HE REPEATED, IS THAT THE NEWS WOULD ONLY BE HEARD 
DOMESTICALLY AND NOT REACH THE REFUGEES.  ANOTHER PROBLEM, 
HE ADDED, IS THAT THE THE SERBS CONSIDER IT AN ADVANTAGE 
FOR THEM TO HAVE THE REFUGEES.  THEY WOULD USE THEM TO 
ALTER THE ETHNIC BALANCE IN KOSOVO AND DID NOT WISH THEIR 
RETURN TO CROATIA. 
 
18. NOT ALL THE REFUGEES ARE GOING TO KOSOVO, SHATTUCK 
REPLIED.  HE NOTED THAT HE SPOKEN TO THE SERBS ABOUT THE 
DESTRUCTION OF VUKOVAR A YEAR AGO AND EARLIER CONDEMNED 
THE MASS KILLINGS IN NORTHEAST BOSNIA.  HE WISHED THE 
MINISTER TO KNOW HIS INTEREST WAS HUMAN RIGHTS. HE HAD 
COME IN THAT SPIRIT TO RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNMENT,

BRIEFED ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.  DAM SAID THE BOSNIAN 
FIFTH CORPS HAD ADVANCED ALMOST 200 KILOMETERS IN SIX 
DAYS, AND NOW HAD TO COVER A CONFRONTATION LINE OF 103 KM 
AND PATROL THE TERRITORY WITH ONLY 20,000 TROOPS.  BOSNIAN 
TROOPS WERE ALSO STATIONED ON THE CROATIAN-BOSNIAN BORDER.

THE VII CORPS HAD SECONDED ONE BRIGADE TO V CORPS 
COMMANDER DUDAKOVIC, GIVING HIM 10 BRIGADES.  DAM BELIEVED 
DUDAKOVIC WOULD TAKE MRKONIC GRAD AND TRY TO TURN THE 
EXPERT LIGHT INFANTRY CORPS ON PRIJEDOR UNLESS  POLITICAL 
PRESSURE FROM SARAJEVO AND NEW YORK STOPPED HIM.  ONE 
ARKAN BRIGADE HAD ARRIVED IN PRIJEDOR 10 DAYS EARLIER, DAM 
SAID.  THE RECENT V CORPS SUCCESSES, DESPITE INCREDIBLE 
ODDS (THE SERB HAD OVER 60,000 TROOPS IN THE BANJA LUKA 
AREA), AND THE LACK OF A COUNTER-OFFENSIVE BY THE BSA HAD 
CONVINCED DAM THAT THE SERBS HAD PURPOSELY EVACUATED THE 
AREA.  THE SERBS EXPECTED TO GIVE UP MUCH OF THIS 
TERRITORY IN POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS ANYWAY, HE COMMENTED.

3.  (U)  THE UN ESTIMATED THAT 11,000 DISPLACED PERSONS 
(DPS) WOULD REACH THE CANTON FROM OTHER PARTS OF BOSNIA, 
MOSTLY BANJA LUKA.  THE GOBH CLAIMED THE NORTHERN BIHAC 
CANTON COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE THEM, AND WANTED TO PLACE 
THEM IN THE NEWLY LIBERATED AREAS.  400-500 MUSLIM 
REFUGEES FROM THE BANJA LUKA REGION HAD ALREADY RESETTLED 
IN THE NORTH.  UNHCR AND CANTON AUTHORITIES DID NOT WANT 
TO SETTLE THESE REFUGEES IN THE EMPTY HOMES OF THE ABDIC 
REFUGEES AND WERE SEARCHING FOR HOUSING.  THE GOBH HAD 
PUBLICLY WELCOMED BACK MOST OF THE ABDIC REFUGEES, BUT 
REFUSED TO DECLARE ANOTHER AMNESTY.  BALLANTYNE SAID THE 
SARAJEVO AUTHORITIES HAD DECLARED THE 1994 AMNESTY STILL 
VALID.  THE BOSNIANS, CROATS, AND TURKS WERE DISCUSSING 
ESTABLISHING A TRILATERAL POLICE FORCE IN THE AREA TO

GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THOSE WHO RETURNED.  BALLANTYNE 
ESTIMATED THAT 10-15 PERCENT OF THESE REFUGEES WOULD NOT 
BE ALLOWED BACK INTO BOSNIA BECAUSE THEY WERE ACCUSED OF 
COMMITTING WAR CRIMES. 
 
4.  (U)  BALLANTYNE ESTIMATED THE CURRENT POPULATION OF 
KLJUC AT 1100.  620 MUSLIMS HAD SURVIVED THREE AND A HALF 
YEARS OF SERBIAN OCCUPATION AND HAD REMAINED IN THE TOWN. 
AFTER UNPROFOR HAD PROTESTED THE RESETTLEMENT OF 207 DPS 
IN KLJUC, AT THE CONFRONTATION LINE, THE GOVERNMENT 
STOPPED THE PLANNED RESETTLEMENT OF ANOTHER 3000.  CROATIA 
REFUSED TO TAKE THESE PEOPLE, AND HAD RECENTLY STOPPED 
ALLOWING THE DPS TRANSIT THROUGH CROATIA AT DVOR, TO THE 
BIHAC CANTON.  THE GOC REFUGEE REPATRIATION ORDER, UN 
OFFICIALS SAID, MIGHT SEND MANY MUSLIMS BACK TO THIS 
TERRITORY BEFORE THE AREA IS SECURE.

THE CURRENT POPULATION WAS ABOUT 1500.  BEFORE THE WAR, 
PETROVAC WAS THE ELEVENTH LARGEST TOWN IN BOSNIA, WITH A 
POPULATION OF 15,000.  3200 MUSLIMS HAD LIVED HERE, HE 
SAID, AND ONLY A FEW CROATS.  THE TOWN WAS DEEP IN ABH- 
HELD TERRITORY AND WAS SAFE FROM SHELLING, HE REASSURED 
US, ADDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO MOVE 
DPS INTO THE AREA, ALTHOUGH ELECTRICITY AND WATER SUPPLY 
PROBLEMS EXISTED. 
 
6. (U) THE TOWN WAS INTACT, AND HAD EXPERIENCED LITTLE 
DAMAGE DURING THE FIGHTING.  UNTENDED LIVESTOCK RAN 
EVERYWHERE -- REMINISCENT OF AN OLD WESTERN FILM, AN 
UNSADDLED HORSE BOLTED IN FEAR DOWN THE STREET, ALMOST RAN 
INTO THE AMBASSADOR, TURNED THE CORNER AND DISAPPEARED. 
SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE MILLING AROUND, SOLDIERS IN UNIFORM 
AND REFUGEES CONFUSED ABOUT THEIR FATE.  ONLY A FEW 
VEHICLES WERE IN EVIDENCE.  AT ONE APARTMENT BLOCK, 
REFUGEES FROM PRNJAVOR AND BOSANSKI NOVI RECOUNTED THEIR 
GRIM PAST.  TWO EXPENSIVE GERMAN CARS WERE PARKED IN A 
SHED NEARBY, REPORTEDLY BELONGING TO VISITORS WHO CAME 
FROM MUNICH TO SEE THEIR ELDERLY PARENTS. 
 
7.  (U) THE VILLAGES SURROUNDING PETROVAC, HOWEVER, WERE 
RUINED.  A SPARSELY POPULATED AREA EVEN IN NORMAL TIMES, 
THE BIHAC-PETROVAC-KLJUC ROAD WAS DESERTED.  CLOTHING AND 
BLANKETS LITTERED THE ROAD, MARKING THE PATH THE SERBS HAD

BEEN RECENTLY BURNED.  THERE WERE BROKEN-DOWN CARS AND 
THREE BURNED-OUT TANKS.  IN A FIELD PAST PETROVAC, AN OLD 
JNA PLANE FROM WWII THAT HAD BEEN A MONUMENT TO AN 
IMPORTANT VISITOR AT THE NEARBY AIRFIELD WAS RIDDLED WITH 
BULLET FIRE.  NEAR KLJUC, A MOSQUE HAD BEEN RAZED TO THE 
GROUND, WITH ONLY ITS DOME INTACT TO REMIND PASSERS-BY OF 
WHERE IT HAD ONCE STOOD.  THE UN TOLD US THE ABH HAD 
CLEARED THE MAIN TERRITORY OF SERB SOLDIERS, BUT SNIPERS 
STILL HID IN THE WOODS IN THE HILLS NORTH OF THE ROAD. 
THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY POCKETS OF SERB CIVILIANS WHO HAD 
BEEN UNABLE TO LEAVE BEFORE THE BOSNIAN ARMY SWEPT PAST 
THEM.

THE SKULL AND RIB CAGE HAD BEEN EXCAVATED AND OLD, 
TATTERED BITS OF CLOTHING WERE VISIBLE AROUND IT.  THE 
LIAISON OFFICER SAID OTHER BODIES HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN 
THIS DITCH AND IN A CAVE LOCATED TWENTY METERS TO THE

9.  (U)  FOR THE RETURN TRIP TO ZAGREB, THE PARTY HAD 
PLANNED TO CROSS THE BRIDGE OVER THE UNA RIVER AT KULEN 
VAKUF AND THEN CROSS INTO CROATIA.  FOUR KILOMETERS 
OUTSIDE THE TOWN, OUR UNMO GUIDE POINTED OUT WHERE HE HAD 
FOUND 15 BODIES (CIVILIAN AND MILITARY, MALE AND FEMALE) 
IN THE UNDERBRUSH NEAR THE ROAD THE PREVIOUS DAY.  TWO 
WERE DECAPITATED.  THE DANISH UNMO SAID SOME CORPSES 
APPEARED TO BE TWO WEEKS OLD, WHILE OTHERS APPEARED TO BE 
MORE RECENT VICTIMS.  THE CORPSES HAD BEEN REMOVED, BUT 
ONLY RECENTLY; THE AREA STILL STANK OF DEATH.

KULEN VAKUF AND THE MOUNTAIN BEYOND, ALTHOUGH THE RIVER 
ITSELF FLOWS THROUGH THE TOWN.  THE BRIDGE HAD BEEN 
SHELLED NEAR THE MUSLIM SIDE AND WAS IMPASSABLE FOR THE 
PARTY\'S VEHICLES.  THE CROATIAN ARMY (HV) HAD CROSSED INTO 
BOSNIA AND HAD OCCUPIED THE TOWN.  THE CROATIAN FLAG FLEW

MAYOR APPROACHED THE AMBASSADOR AND APPEALED FOR HELP TO 
ALLOW THE ORIGINAL RESIDENTS TO RETURN.  MOST OF THEM WERE 
EAGER TO RETURN, HE CLAIMED, BUT THE CROATS WERE REFUSING 
ENTRY TO ALL BOSNIANS.  THE HV SOLDIERS WERE CLEARLY 
RELIEVED WHEN THE U.S. PARTY CROSSED BACK TO THE ABH-HELD

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  TALKS WERE HELD OCTOBER 6-8 BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE 
B-H, CROATIAN, AND TURKISH GOVERNMENTS TO ESTABLISH THE 
FRAMEWORK FOR A TRILATERAL ENTITY THAT WOULD MONITOR THE 
RIGHTS OF REFUGEES (ABDIC SUPPORTERS) WHO RETURN FROM 
CROATIA TO THE VELIKA KLADUSA AREA.  TURKISH DELEGATION 
HAS RETURNED TO ANKARA TO SEEK APPROVAL FOR PARTICIPATION 
IN SUCH AN EFFORT.  SEVERAL DETAILS REMAIN UNSETTLED, BUT 
ALL THREE GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING QUICKLY TO GET THE ISSUE 
RESOLVED SO THE REFUGEES CAN RETURN HOME BEFORE WINTER 
SETS IN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
TRYING TO BUILD TRUST 
--------------------- 
 
2.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE THE 22,000 REFUGEES FROM 
VELIKA KLADUSA TO RETURN HOME VOLUNTARILY, THE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS DEVELOPED FURTHER ITS EARLIER IDEA TO 
ESTABLISH A MONITORING FORCE COMPRISED OF POLICE FROM 
TURKEY, CROATIA, AND BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA (FROM AN AREA 
OUTSIDE OF BIHAC).  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE THREE 
GOVERNMENTS MET IN CROATIA AND IN VELIKA KLADUSA OCTOBER 
6-8 TO WORK OUT THE MODALITIES OF SUCH A MONITORING FORCE.

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03944  01 OF 02  101335Z 
 
3. ACCORDING TO THE PLAN, THE B-H GOVERNMENT WOULD AGREE 
TO REMOVE THE V CORPS FROM THE AREA, PROVIDE WRITTEN 
GUARANTEES OF THE RIGHTS THAT WILL BE GRANTED TO 
RETURNEES, PARTICIPATE IN THE TRILATERAL MONITORING 
EFFORT.  IT IS THE HOPE OF ALL PARTIES THAT WITH SUCH 
PROVISIONS IN PLACE THE REFUGEES WILL VOLUNTARILY RETURN 
TO THEIR HOMES. 
 
--------------------------------- 
RESULTS OF TRILATERAL DISCUSSIONS 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO THE TURKISH EMBASSY IN ZAGREB, THE TALKS 
WERE BASICALLY POSITIVE, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NUMEROUS 
DETAILS STILL TO BE DECIDED.  THE GROUPS DISCUSSED THE 
MANDATE, DURATION, AND SIZE OF THE FORCE, AND IT WAS 
DECIDED THAT 
 
-- THE PARTICIPANTS WILL ONLY MONITOR; THEY ARE NOT IN A 
POSITION TO ENFORCE.  VIOLATIONS WOULD BE REPORTED TO THE 
B-H GOVERNMENT; ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTION WOULD BE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. 
 
-- THE RATIO WILL BE 50 PERCENT BOSNIAN, 25 PERCENT 
CROATIAN, AND 25 PERCENT TURKISH. 
-- THE TERRITORY TO BE COVERED IS APPROXIMATELY 400 SQUARE 
KILOMETERS, INCLUDING VELIKA KLADUSA AND SEVERAL VILLAGES 
NEAR CAZIN.

ISSUES STILL PENDING

5.  THE SIZE OF THE FORCE HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED, BUT 
POSSIBILITIES RANGED FROM 100 TO 200 POLICE OFFICERS.  (WE 
HAD HEARD ORIGINALLY THAT THE FORCE WOULD CONSIST OF ABOUT 
150 INDIVIDUALS.) 
 
6.  THE LARGEST UNRESOLVED ISSUE, HOWEVER, IS THE MATTER 
OF WRITTEN, ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS FROM THE B-H GOVERNMENT. 
THE REFUGEES ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE AMNESTY THAT HAS 
BEEN ANNOUNCED BY SARAJEVO.  THEY WANT SPECIFIC GUARANTEES 
IN WRITING THAT COVER SUCH TOPICS AS NO PROSECUTION FOR 
WAR CRIMES, NO CONSCRIPTION INTO THE MILITARY, RETURN OF 
ALL PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN SEIZED BY OTHERS (REFUGEES FROM 
BANJA LUKA WHO WERE BUSED INTO THE BIHAC AREA BY THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT), EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, ETC.

2. SUMMARY: PRESIDENT FRANJO TUDJMAN AND HIS TEAM GOT AN 
ALMOST UNANIMOUS MANDATE FROM PARTY DELEGATES AT A LAVISH 
TWO-DAY PARTY CONGRESS IN A ZAGREB CONCERT HALL OCTOBER 
14-15.  TUDJMAN REAFFIRMED HIS CONSERVATIVE NATIONALIST 
POLICIES, BUT  ANATHEMATIZED NATIONALIST EXTREMIST 
TOMISLAV MERCEP FROM THE CONGRESS ON THE SECOND DAY. 
REPEATING CALLS FOR LAW AND ORDER IN THE KRAJINA, TUDJMAN 
SAID CROATIA WOULD NOT GET IN THE WAY OF INTERNATIONAL 
NEGOTIATING EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT THE PEACEFUL 
REINTEGRATION OF SERB-HELD EASTERN SLAVONIA, BUT 
REITERATED THAT CROATIA IS PREPARED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
BY ITSELF. END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  TUDJMAN TOLD THE APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE OCTOBER 14 
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO DEVIATION FROM THE CENTRIST 
POLICIES THAT HAD CHARACTERIZED HIS GOVERNMENT.  HE MADE 
A STRONG PLEA FOR LAW AND ORDER, CONDEMNING THE \"CRIMINAL 
ELEMENTS\" WHICH HAD VIOLATED THE LAW IN THE KRAJINA. 
TUDJMAN NOTED THAT CROATIA HAS BECOME A REGIONAL POWER, 
CREATING AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES\' PEACE 
INITIATIVE COULD OPERATE.  TUDJMAN SAID CROATIA WAS 
WILLING TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER NATIONS AS AN INDEPENDENT 
STATE. 
 
4. ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE CONGRESS, TUDJMAN WAS 
RETURNED TO THE PARTY PRESIDENCY WITH 1,199 OF 1294 VOTES 
CAST. FONMIN GRANIC AND DEFMIN SUSAK WERE ELECTED AS 
PARTY VICE PRESIDENTS, ALONG WITH THREE OTHERS.  THE

HERZEGOVINA. 
 
5.  TUDJMAN ANNOUNCED THAT THE HDZ LEADERSHIP HAD NO ROOM 
FOR THE LIKES OF MERCEP, IN SPITE OF HIS VALUABLE WARTIME 
SERVICES.  MERCEP THEN WALKED OUT OF THE PARTY CONGRESS. 
PLAYING THE CENTRIST THEME AGAIN, TUDJMAN SAID MERCEP\'S 
PARTY PAPER WAS NO MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN THE \"FERAL 
TRIBUNE.\"  COMMENT:  MERCEP WAS THE COMMANDER OF A LOCAL 
DEFENSE UNIT DEFENDING VUKOVAR IN 1991; AFTER VUKOVAR 
FELL, HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO OGULIN, WHERE UNITS UNDER HIS 
COMMAND ARE WIDELY BELIEVED TO HAVE COMMITTED WAR CRIMES. 
\"FERAL TRIBUNE\" IS A SATIRICAL WEEKLY WELL KNOWN FOR 
TAKING POTSHOTS AT TUDJMAN.  END COMMENT. 
 
6.  LA BELLE JOUR:  THE MOOD AT THE HDZ CONVENTION WAS 
UPBEAT AND FESTIVE. SECURITY WAS POLITE AND EFFICIENT; 
WELL-DRESSED YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN SERVED AS CONTROLS AND 
ESCORTS.  INITIAL SPEECHES WERE MADE BY PARLIAMENTARIANS 
FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, WITH PRIDE OF PLACE GIVEN TO 
THE GERMAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION--READ BAVARIA--AND 
CHRISTIAN SOCIALIST UNION, WHOSE REMARKS IN GERMAN WERE 
WIDELY UNDERSTOOD BY THE AUDIENCE.  THE OCTOBER 14 
MORNING SESSION WAS FOLLOWED BY A GOURMET BUFFET WITH 
MUSIC AND TWO KINDS OF WINE.  ABOUT THE ONLY JARRING NOTE 
WAS THE IRRITATION OF THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR, WHOSE 
PARKED CAR WAS REMOVED FROM THE ROADWAY AND PLACED ABOUT 
FIFTY FEET AWAY BY ONE OF THE ZAGREB TRAFFIC \"PINCERS.\" 
 
7. COMMENT.  THE HDZ PARTY CONVENTION SEEMED PLANNED TO 
EXHIBIT THE SELF-SATISFACTION OF VICTORS.  EVEN SOME 
TUDJMAN REMARKS QUESTIONING THE PATRIOTISM OF THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUCCESSFUL POLICIES AND CONFIDENTLY LOOK FORWARD TO 
FURTHER SUCCESS IN THE POLLS OCTOBER 29.  RECENT CHANGES 
TO THE ELECTION LAW WILL ONLY HELP THEM.  END COMMENT.

7.  (U)  AT THE SANAKERAM FACILITY, A CRIPPLED EX- 
DETAINEE, ABOUT 40, WHO HAD RETURNED TO SEARCH FOR A COAT 
HE HAD LEFT BEHIND, SHOWED US THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS HELD. 
A POTENT FETID SMELL OVERWHELMED THE GROUP ON ENTERING THE 
CAFETERIA.  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD LIVED 
THERE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS. 
BLOOD AND EXCREMENT STAINS REMAINED ON THE WALLS AND 
FLOORS OF THE CAFETERIA, THE ENTRANCE, AND OTHER SMALL 
OFFICES.  OUR IMPROMPTU GUIDE POINTED OUT POSITIONS WHERE 
GUARDS HAD STOOD WATCH OVER THE BUILDING AND THE PLACES OF 
THE FIRING SQUAD AS THEY SHOT THE 11 PRISONERS.  HE 
IDENTIFIED A TORN CHAIR IN THE FRONT ENTRANCE TO WHICH 
PRISONERS HAD BEEN TIED AND BEATEN.

8.  (U)  ON THE MORNING OF OCTOBER 10, THE MEN WERE TAKEN 
OUT OF THE BUILDING AND FORCED TO MARCH ON THE ROAD AND 
THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARD PRIJEDOR.  AT DZEVAR FIELD, THEY 
SAT DOWN WITH THEIR HEADS LOWERED AND A SOLDIER EXCLAIMED 
THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE KILLED.  ONE DOCTOR AMONG THE 
MUSLIMS THEN STEPPED OUT AND TOOK ASIDE A SOLDIER WHO 
APPEARED TO BE IN COMMAND.  THE SOLDIERS MADE THE MEN SIT 
IN THE SHADOWS, UNDER TREES.  AFTER ONE HOUR, THE GROUP 
WAS BROUGHT WATER.  THEY STARTED MARCHING AGAIN, AND 
REACHED THE VILLAGE OF RASAVCI, OVER FIFTEEN KM FROM THE 
FACTORY, BEFORE TRUCKS ARRIVED TO TAKE THEM TO THEIR 
DESTINATION. 
 
9.  (U)  THE GROUP WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE WAREHOUSE OF AN 
AUTO TRANSPORT SERVICE (AUTOPREVOZ) IN THE URIJE DISTRICT 
OF NORTH PRIJEDOR.  FOR FIVE DAYS THEY RECEIVED ONLY 
WATER.  NO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION VISITED THEM.  WHEN 
VISITORS ARRIVED, THE SOLDIERS HID THE PRISONERS IN THE 
WOODS FOR HOURS UNTIL THE STRANGERS LEFT.  CONDITIONS AT 
THIS CENTER WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN SANSKI MOST.  FOOD 
WAS IRREGULAR.  BEATINGS OCCURRED REGULARLY.  ONE GUARD 
TOLD THE PRISONERS ON ARRIVAL, \"I\'VE GOT THE PLEASURE TO 
BEAT YOU ALL TONIGHT.\"   FOUR GUARDS STOOD INSIDE THE

ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE HAD LEFT DURING THE SUMMER, 
BUYING THEIR WAY TO CROATIA OR OTHER COUNTRIES.  THERE 
WERE 893 MEN BETWEEN 16 AND 60.  HE SAID 410 WERE TAKEN TO 
SANAKERAM, 60 TO A CAMP IN SEHOVACA, AND 105 HELD IN 
BETONIRKA, A CEMENT FACTORY.  OTHERS LEFT ON CONVOYS.  WE 
HAVE INFORMED THE ICRC OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS DOCUMENT.

SANSKI MOST TODAY 
----------------- 
 
11.  (U)  SUAD KURBEGOVIC, ADVISER TO THE SANSKI MOST 
MAYOR, TOLD ZAGREB POLOFF OCTOBER 31 THAT OVER 200 MUSLIMS 
AND 70-100 CROATS WERE KILLED DURING THE SERB WITHDRAWAL 
FROM SANSKI MOST.  HE REPORTED FIRING SQUAD KILLINGS IN 
THE VILLAGES OF TRNOVA AND SEJKOVACA: 8-15 PEOPLE DIED IN 
EACH INSTANCE.  SEVENTEEN BUSES HAVE RETURNED DISPLACED 
PEOPLE TO THEIR HOMES FROM ZENICA IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS. 
200-300 CROATS STILL LIVE IN SANSKI MOST, ALTHOUGH VERY 
FEW SERBS REMAINED.  POLOFF VISITED THE EMPTY SOCCER 
STADIUM IN TOWN, A SITE WHERE PROFESSOR KOLJEVIC CLAIMED 
MUSLIMS WERE INTERNING 2000 SERBS.  TOWN OFFICIALS HAD 
TRANSFORMED THE STADIUM INTO A CAR IMPOUND LOT FOR SERB 
VEHICLES.  A FEW HORSES GRAZED THE PLENTIFUL GREEN GRASS, 
AN INDICATION THAT 2000 PEOPLE COULD NOT RECENTLY HAVE 
CAMPED THERE. 
 
12.  (U)  THE TOWN APPEARED MOSTLY INTACT, ALTHOUGH THE 
TEAM DROVE THROUGH MANY RECENTLY DESTROYED SERB VILLAGES 
AND THREE-YEAR-OLD DESTROYED MUSLIM VILLAGES.  WATER WAS

AVAILABLE AS WAS MINIMAL ELECTRICITY.  TELEPHONE SERVICE 
WAS NON-EXISTENT.  THE TOWN HAD BEEN UNABLE TO HOOK UP TO 
THE ELECTRICITY GRID IN JAJCE BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS WITH THE 
HVO, SO KURBEGOVIC SAID ALTERNATE PLANS WERE BEING MADE TO 
RECEIVE ELECTRICITY FROM BIHAC.  ON NOVEMBER 1, ABH VII 
CORPS, BASED IN TRAVNIK, MOVED ITS REGIONAL COMMAND CENTER 
FROM KLJUC TO SANSKI MOST AS THE LATTER WAS TRANSFERRED 
FROM V CORPS\'S TO VII CORPS\'S AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY (AOR) 
THAT DAY.  GENERAL ALAGIC WAS SKEPTICAL OF EFFORTS THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS MAKING TO INVESTIGATE HUMAN 
RIGHTS CONDITIONS AND WAR CRIMES, EVEN THOSE COMMITTED BY 
THE SERBS.  INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS IN THE AREA ALSO HAD 
DIFFICULTY DEALING WITH ALAGIC.  ALAGIC WAS DETAINED AND 
TORTURED BY SERBS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR, AND REMAINS 
VERY BITTER NOT ONLY AT Q 
ICRC AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL GROUPS WHO, HE FEELS, DID 
NOTHING SUBSTANTIVE TO PREVENT THE MISTREATMENT OF THOSE 
HELD.  ON NOVEMBER 2, BETWEEN BOSANSKO GRAHOVO AND LIVNO, 
THE EMBASSY TEAM PASSED 8-10 TRAVNIK-REGISTERED BUSES AND 
ABH MILITARY-REGISTERED TRUCKS HEADED NORTH, FILLED WITH 
UNIFORMED MEN.

LIVED IN THE TOWN CURRENTLY.  EGRLIC PROVIDED POLOFF WITH 
TWENTY NAMES OF MEN LAST SEEN DIGGING TRENCHES IN KLJUC IN 
AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER WHICH HE HAD NOT YET REPORTED MISSING 
TO THE ICRC.  WE PASSED THESE NAMES TO ICRC ZAGREB.  THE 
TOWN HAD SUBMITTED TO THE ICRC 570 NAMES OF KLJUC

1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT P. FINN, DCM, PER 1(5)(B). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY:  AFTER CONSIDERABLE PRODDING, THE GOC 
HAS PROVIDED US A REPORT INDICATING THAT AS OF OCTOBER 
31, A TOTAL OF 19 PERSONS ARE UNDER CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION FOR MURDERS COMMITTED IN THE \"KRAJINA.\" 
1260 PERSONS ARE BEING PROCESSED IN 779 CASES OF 
LOOTING, AND ELEVEN PERSONS ARE UNDER SUSPECION OF 
ARSON (THOUGH THERE MAY BE MANY MORE).  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 7, A CONTACT AT THE GOC MINISTRY OF 
INTERIOR PROVIDED US (AFTER TWO WEEKS\' DELAY) A REPORT 
OFFERING DETAILS BEHIND SOME OF THE NUMBERS ANNOUNCED 
EARLIER FOR JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING CRIMES IN 
FORMER SECTORS NORTH AND SOUTH.  AS THERE WAS 
APPARENTLY SOME HESITANCY ON THE PART OF OUR CONTACT IN 
DIVULGING THIS MATERIAL, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT 
HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR USG 
BACKGROUND USE ONLY. 
 
4. (C) ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, 19 PERSONS HAVE SO FAR 
BEEN TURNED OVER TO INVESTIGATIVE COURT FOR POSSIBLE 
CHARGES OF MURDER.  (NOTE: THE ACTUAL TOTAL APPEARS TO 
BE 26 BECAUSE SOME INDIVIDUALS WERE INVOLVED IN MORE 
THAN ONE OF THE CRIMES.)  OTHER CASES ARE STILL UNDER

5. (C) THE MOI FURTHER STATES THAT AT LEAST 2787 CASES 
OF \"FIRES, MAINLY IN RESIDENCES AND COMMERCIAL 
BUILDINGS,\" HAVE BEEN REPORTED, BUT THAT BECAUSE OF THE 
TIME REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FIRES WERE 
CAUSED BY ARSON OR WAR DAMAGE, ONLY 11 PERSONS HAVE SO 
FAR BEEN CHARGED.  THE RECORD IS BETTER ON FELONY THEFT 
(LOOTING), WHERE 1054 CASES ARE UNDER REVIEW, OF WHICH 
779, INVOLVING 1260 SUSPECTED INDIVIDUALS, HAVE BEEN 
TURNED OVER FOR CRIMINAL PROCESSING (I.E.,

WE INVITED FOUR COLUMNISTS FROM CROATIA\'S MAIN 
NEWSPAPERS FOR A SESSION WITH AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH IN 
THE HOPES OF GETTING OUR VIEWS OUT.  THE FIRST FRUITS OF 
THIS DISCUSSION APPEARED TODAY (NOVEMBER 16) IN ONE OF 
THOSE PAPERS, VECERNJI LIST, UNDER THE HEADLINE 
\"SKELETON WITHOUT THE FLESH: AMERICA\'S VIEW OF THE 
AGREEMENT ON EASTERN SLAVONIA.\" 
 
2.  FOLLOWING ARE SIGNIFICANT EXCERPTS FROM THAT COLUMN, 
BY FOREIGN AFFAIRS WRITER MARINA SERIC: 
 
(BEGIN TEXT) 
 
THE BASICS OF THE AGREEMENT ON EASTERN SLAVONIA CAN BE 
UNDERSTOOD TO BE A SKELETON TO WHICH THE \"FLESH\" STILL NEEDS 
TO BE ATTACHED.  IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYTHING TO GO 
SMOOTHLY, FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY (LIVING) THERE TO STAY 
AND FOR THOSE WHO WERE EXPELLED TO RETURN, AND FOR (EASTERN 
SLAVONIA) TO BE A MULTI-ETHNIC COMMUNITY AGAIN.  THE 
TRANSITIONAL AUTHORITY WILL BE A NEUTRAL FORCE THAT WILL BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTACHING THE FLESH TO THE SKELETON AND FOR 
EVERYTHING GOING SMOOTHLY.  THIS COULD SUMMARIZE THE 
THOUGHTS ON THE BASIC AGREEMENT ABOUT EASTERN SLAVONIA FROM 
THE MOUTH OF THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR PETER GALBRAITH. . . . 
 
\"THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THE WAR BEGAN.  THEREFORE, IT IS 
LOGICAL THAT ITS END BEGIN THERE.  THAT REGION NEEDS TO 
REMAIN A MULTI-ETHNIC COMMUNITY.  THIS AGREEMENT IS A BASIS 
FOR THE INITIATIVES OF BOTH SIDES, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR 
ITS REALIZATION.  THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD EXISTS BECAUSE IT 
IS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESENT LOCAL POPULATION TO PREPARE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  04591  161634Z 
ITSELF FOR NORMAL LIFE WITHIN CROATIA,\" EXPLAINS GALBRAITH. 
 
THE U.S. HAS APPROACHED THIS PROBLEM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF 
ITS OWN MULTI-ETHNICITY. THEREFORE ONE OF THE BASIC IDEAS IS 
THAT AN AREA THAT USED TO BE MULTI-ETHNIC IN THE PAST REMAIN 
MULTI-ETHNIC IN THE FUTURE.  \"THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY 
HERE FOR THOSE WHO ARE THERE TO REMAIN, AT THE SAME TIME FOR 
THOSE WHO WERE EXPELLED TO RETURN, AND FOR THE 
REESTABLISHMENT OF CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THESE PEOPLES.  THAT 
WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE FOR BOSNIA,\" CLAIMS GALBRAITH, 
WHO IS CONVINCED THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT THE 
AGREEMENT WILL FALL APART AND (WHO) BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN 
THE INTERESTS OF ALL THAT THE TRANSITION PERIOD \"PASS 
SMOOTHLY, WITHOUT A MASSIVE EXODUS OF THE SERB POPULATION 
AND WITHOUT INCITING NEW EMOTIONS FOR WAR.\" 
 
HE ALSO CONSIDERS THIS AGREEMENT TO BE A SIGN OF THE 
MATURITY OF THE SERB NEGOTIATING TEAM, WHICH, UNLIKE THE 
KNIN LEADERSHIP, UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE IN A DIFFICULT 
SITUATION.  (SERB DELEGATION HEAD) MILAN MILANOVIC WAS 
DESCRIBED AS AN INFLUENTIAL MAN WHO OPERATED IN THE 
BACKGROUND.  \"THERE WEREN\'T ANY ARGUMENTS WITHIN THE SERB 
DELEGATION, AS THERE WERE IN KNIN, WHOSE LEADERSHIP SHOWED 
ITSELF TO BE TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.  THESE (PEOPLE) HAVE 
LEARNED SOMETHING AND ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY.  GREAT CREDIT 
MUST GO TO (CROATIAN DELEGATION CHIEF HRVOJE) SARINIC AND 
HIS TEAM.  IT WAS A MATTER OF INTELLIGENT AND ELEGANT 
COMPROMISES,\" CONCLUDED THE AMBASSADOR. 
 
ASKED WHETHER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ONE BETWEEN PRESIDENTS 
TUDJMAN AND IZETBEGOVIC IN DAYTON WERE ONLY MASKS FOR THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  04591  161634Z 
(LACK OF) SUCCESS OF NEGOTIATIONS ON BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA, 
GALBRAITH SAID THAT IT IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE, THAT THESE 
SUCCESSES ARE SIGNS OF RESOLVE TO FIND A SOLUTION, AND THAT 
\"THE QUESTION OF BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA CANNOT BE SOLVED BEFORE 
THE QUESTION OF CROATIA IS SOLVED.\" 
THE LIFTING OF THE OTHER \"WALL\" -- SANCTIONS ON SERBIA -- 
BEHIND WHICH LIES THE POSSIBILITY OF SERBIA\'S ACCEPTANCE 
INTO EUROPEAN AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, WILL BE 
TIED TO RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE PROBLEM OF 
KOSOVO, AND TO COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES 
TRIBUNAL IN THE HAGUE.  IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT 
SIMILAR CONDITIONS APPLY ALSO FOR CROATIA.

HAVE BEEN BEEN MISSING SINCE 1991.  SOME HOLD PLACARDS 
ALOFT, REMINDING THOSE IN DAYTON NOT TO FORGET THE 
MISSING IN VUKOVAR. 
 
3.  ON NOVEMBER 15, AS HE DOES MOST DAYS, AMBASSADOR 
GALBRAITH STROLLED OVER TO TALK TO THE THEM.  THIS TIME, 
UNLIKE MOST DAYS, IN ADDITION TO THE DEMONSTRATORS AND 
THE USUAL KNOT OF CURIOUS ONLOOKERS A LARGE GROUP OF 
REPORTERS, FROM BOTH THE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MEDIA, HAD 
GATHERED.  THEY PEPPERED THE AMBASSADOR WITH QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE DAY -- THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

REACTION TO BLASKIC\'S NEW POSITION.  AMBASSADOR 
GALBRAITH REPLIED BY REITERATING THE LONG-STANDING 
AMERICAN POSITION -- THAT (TO QUOTE THE CROATIAN NEWS 
AGENCY ACCOUNT) THE \"CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS STATED THAT 
IT WILL COOPERATE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR 
WAR CRIMES COMMITTED IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.  WE EXPECT 
THAT IT WILL DO SO.\" THE CROATIAN NEWS AGENCY\'S SHORT 
REPORT ALSO QUOTED THE AMBASSADOR AS SAYING:  \"BLASKIC 
AND KORDIC WERE INDICTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES 
TRIBUNAL, AND ALL COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, IN THIS CASE 
CROATIA AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO 
ARREST AND EXTRADITE THEM. . . . COOPERATION WITH THE 
WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL WILL BE ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THAT 
WILL DETERMINE OUR RELATIONS WITH THE STATES OF THIS 
REGION.\" 
 
NOT THE TOP OF THE NEWS 
----------------------- 
4.  MOST NATIONAL DAILIES CARRIED THIS REPORT, THOUGH 
THEY HARDLY PLAYED IT PROMINENTLY.  IT TENDED TO BE A 
VERY SHORT SIDE BAR TO A LARGER STORY ON THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S REMARKS TO THE MOTHERS OF VUKOVAR. 
CROATIAN TELEVISION, HOWEVER, TOOK THIS TO ITS LOGICAL 
EXTREME.  ALTHOUGH IT SHOWED A PICTURE OF THE AMBASSADOR 
ACTUALLY MAKING HIS STATEMENTS ABOUT BLASKIC AND KORDIC 
ON THE MAIN EVENING NEWS, THE REPORTER\'S VOICE-OVER 
MENTIONED NOT ONE WORD ABOUT THIS PART OF HIS REMARKS, 
BUT INSTEAD DEVOTED SEVERAL MINUTES TO AN ACCOUNT OF THE 
STATEMENTS THE AMBASSADOR MADE TO THE MOTHERS ABOUT THE 
NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MISSING.

5.  THIS INTERESTING EXERCISE IN NEWS JUDGMENT WAS 
ESPECIALLY IRONIC BECAUSE CROATIAN TELEVISION WAS THE 
FIRST IN THIS COUNTRY TO RECEIVE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
BLASKIC\'S NEW POSITION, BEFORE EVEN THE PRESIDENCY 
ITSELF.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT, WHICH WAS PICTURED ON THE 
NEWS ON THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 13, HAD BEEN FAXED 
DIRECTLY FROM DAYTON; APPARENTLY DONE ON AN AMERICAN 
WORD-PROCESSOR, THE NECESSARY CROATIAN DIACRITICAL 
MARKINGS HAD BEEN PENCILLED IN BY HAND.  SOMEONE HAD 
OVIOUSLY CHOSEN TO SACRIFICE GOOD FORM FOR GRE 
AT SPEED.

1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT P. FINN, CHARGE, 1.5 (D). 
 
2.  (C)  IN THE PAST WEEK, CIVILIAN AND MILITARY COURTS IN 
CROATIA HAVE SENTENCED MANY SERBS TO PRISON FOR ARMED 
REBELLION AND WAR CRIMES COMMITTED DURING THE PAST FOUR 
YEARS.  UNCRO IS ORGANIZING A TASK FORCE WITH OTHER UN 
AGENCIES AND INTERESTED INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO 
OBSERVE THESE TRIALS AND MONITOR THE LEGAL AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS OF THE DETAINED.  POLOFF WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE 
MONITORING.  MANY SERBS ON TRIAL ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY A 
LAWYER, AND THOSE WITH COURT-APPOINTED COUNSEL HAVE 
USUALLY MET THEIR LAWYERS ONLY ONCE OR TWICE, OFTEN ONLY 
AT THE COURT INVESTIGATIVE HEARINGS.  UNCRO HAS REQUESTED 
THAT THE GOC EXTEND THE GENERAL AMNESTY FOR ARMED 
REBELLION FROM THE CURRENT LIMIT OF MAY 10, 1995 TO COVER 
THE AUGUST EVENTS.  UN OFFICIALS TELL US THAT THE GOC HAS 
BEEN UNRESPONSIVE SO FAR.  THE PARLIAMENT RECENTLY 
EXTENDED THE QUESTIONING PERIOD UNDER WHICH MEN CAN BE 
DETAINED WITHOUT CHARGES FROM THREE TO SIX MONTHS, I.E. TO 
FEBRUARY, 1996.  AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS, THIS EXTENSION 
MEANS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS CANNOT FILE TO RECOVER THEIR 
PROPERTY, WHICH THEY MUST DO BY DECEMBER 4 UNDER THE 
CURRENT LAW.

3.  (U)  ON NOVEMBER 14, THE PARISH COURT IN OSIJEK 
CONVICTED, IN ABSENTIA, EIGHT SERBS FROM TENJE (IN EASTERN 
SLAVONIA) OF \"GENOCIDE,\" ISSUING SENTENCES BETWEEN 10 AND 
15 YEARS IN LENGTH.  THE SERBS WERE ACCUSED OF COMMITTING 
CRIMES AGAINST THE CROAT AND OTHER MINORITY CIVILIAN 
POPULATION OF TENJE IN 1991-1992.  THE LIST OF CRIMES 
INCLUDED ORGANIZING AND IMPLEMENTING TERROR CAMPAIGNS AND 
FORCED LABOR BRIGADES, LIMITING CIVILIAN FREEDOM OF 
MOVEMENT, MAKING DEATH THREATS, LOOTING, AND MINING AND 
DESTROYING PROPERTY.  THE COURT CLAIMED THAT, AS A RESULT 
OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE EIGHT SERBS, 24 CROATS WERE 
KILLED AND 98 WERE EXPELLED FROM THE TERRITORY.  GORAN 
HADZIC (A NEGOTIATOR IN THE EASTERN SLAVONIA PEACE 
AGREEMENT), WAS TO BE TRIED WITH THIS GROUP OF EIGHT, BUT 
THE JUDGE DECIDED TO TRY HIS CASE SEPARATELY AT THE LAST 
MINUTE.

5.  (U)  ON NOVEMBER 16, THE SAME COURT SENTENCED A SECOND 
GROUP OF TWELVE DETAINEES TO 3 TO 6,#QV IN PRISON FOR 
SIMILAR CHARGES.  TWO HAD JOINED THE REBEL FORCES IN 1991 
AND HAD FOUGHT IN THE \"ARSK\" THROUGHOUT THE WAR.  THE 
OTHER 10 HAD LEFT THE OCCUPIED AREAS BETWEEN 1991-1993 FOR 
SERBIA, HAD BEEN MOBILIZED IN SERBIA DURING THE PAST 
SUMMER, AND WERE RETURNED TO SECTORS NORTH AND SOUTH TO 
FIGHT.  ALL 12 WERE BORN IN CROATIA.  ANOTHER 47 SERBS 
REMAIN IN THE GOSPIC JAIL UNDER \"INVESTIGATIVE 
PROCEEDINGS.\"  THEY WILL BE CHARGED AND TRIED NEXT WEEK. 
 
6.  (U)  ON NOVEMBER 16, THE PARISH COURT IN ZADAR STARTED 
TRIAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST 25 INDIVIDUALS FOR WAR CRIMES 
COMMITTED IN SKABRNJA IN 1991.  ONLY ONE MAN IS IN 
CUSTODY.  THE OTHER 24 ARE BEING TRIED IN ABSENTIA.  AT 
LEAST TWO WOMEN ARE AMONG THE GROUP.  A 19-YEAR-OLD 
WITNESS TESTIFIED THAT ON NOVEMBER 19, 1991, YUGOSLAV ARMY 
(JNA) SERBS SHOT AND SLAUGHTERED SEVERAL OF HIS RELATIVES 
AND NEIGHBORS AFTER THEIR BASEMENT HIDING PLACE HAD BEEN 
DISCOVERED.  HE AND OTHERS WERE TAKEN TO NEARBY VILLAGES 
WHERE THEY WERE HELD IN A FREEZER AND TORTURED UNTIL SOME 
NON-SERB JNA SOLDIERS SAVED THEIR LIVES.

7.  (C)  THE SISAK PARISH COURT STARTED TRIAL PROCEEDINGS 
AGAINST FIVE SERBS NOVEMBER 16 ACCUSED OF COMMITTING 
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.  SPECIFIC 
CHARGES INCLUDE MURDER, LOOTING, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, 
AND ORDERING EXPULSIONS.  ALL FIVE WERE ARRESTED DURING 
THE MAY OFFENSIVE ON SECTOR WEST.  (COMMENT:  ONE SOURCE 
WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE SPOKEN TO SOME OF THESE FIVE MEN SAYS 
THEY ARE \"GUILTY AS HELL\" AND EVEN ADMIT IT TO 
INTERLOCUTORS THEY TRUST.  THE SAME CONTACT, HOWEVER,

2.  (C) SUMMARY:  ON DECEMBER 2 A 30-MEMBER CODEL LED BY 
REPRESENTATIVES MOLINARI AND LEVIN VISITED ZAGREB TO 
DISCUSS U.S. PARTICIPATION IN IFOR DEPLOYMENT IN BOSNIA. 
THE CODEL MET WITH SRSG KOFI ANNAN AND GENERAL JANVIER, 
AND LATER WITH PRESIDENT TUDJMAN.  JANVIER SAID THE \"THE 
WAR IS OVER\" AND THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS MUCH IMPROVED, 
THOUGH FIGHTING CONTINUED AND CASUALTIES MUST BE EXPECTED. 
ANNAN AND TUDJMAN DISCUSSED THE IMPORTANCE OF U.S. 
PARTICIPATION.  BOTH SAID SEPARATELY THAT WHILE DANGERS 
EXIST, NEITHER BELIEVES NATO WILL BECOME ENGAGED IN 
RENEWED WARFARE BECAUSE THE SITUATION HAS FUNDAMENTALLY 
CHANGED SINCE ALL SIDES HAVE SIGNED ON TO A PEACE 
AGREEMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
CODEL MOLINARI MEETS ANNAN AND JANVIER 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) IN A MEETING AT UN PROTECTION FORCE (UNPF) 
HEADQUARTERS, SRSG KOFI ANNAN GAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ROLE 
OF PEACEKEEPING VERSUS PEACE IMPLEMENTATION.  HE ARGUED 
STRONGLY THAT THE UN HAS LAID A SOLID GROUNDWORK FOR THE 
IMPLEMENTING FORCE FOR BOSNIA.  GENERAL JANVIER DESCRIBED 
THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND EMPHASIZED THAT THERE HAD 
NOT BEEN A COMPLETE HALT TO THE FIGHTING, BUT CURRENTLY 
THE UN ENJOYED FULL FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IN MOST AREAS OF 
BOSNIA, PARTICULARLY IN SARAJEVO.

CONTINGENT WOULD BE UNDER NATO COMMAND AND EXPRESSED 
CONCERN OVER COMMENTS BY FRENCH GENERAL BACHELET CRITICAL 
OF THE U.S. ROLE IN NEGOTIATING THE DAYTON AGREEMENT 
(REF).  ANNAN ASSURED THE REPRESENTATIVES THAT THERE WAS 
NO DOUBT THAT THE FRENCH WOULD BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF 
NATO.  HE SAID THAT GENERAL BACHELET\'S COMMENTS WERE 
UNFORTUNATE AND MARRED HIS OTHERWISE OUTSTANDING RECORD 
(AS THE GENERAL WHO LIFTED THE SIEGE OF SARAJEVO). 
GENERAL JANVIER SAID BACHELET\'S COMMENTS WERE HIS OFF-THE- 
RECORD PERSONAL OPINIONS AND DID NOT REFLECT THE VIEWS OF 
EITHER THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY. 
 
5.  (C) REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF IFOR AND THE 
TRANSITION FROM UN TO NATO CONTROL, ANNAN TOLD THE CODEL 
THAT THE ENTIRE UN MILITARY COMMAND WOULD BE WITHDRAWN AND 
ALL COMMAND FUNCTIONS WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO NATO.  THE 
ONLY REMAINING UN INVOLVEMENT IN BIH WOULD BE HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE, HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORING WITH AN INTERNATIONAL 
POLICE TASK FORCE, AND SUPPORT FOR THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE 
WHO WILL CONTROL CIVILIAN ACTIVITIES. 
 
------------------------ 
JANVIER: THE WAR IS OVER 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO THE CODEL\'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
POTENTIAL FOR U.S. TROOPS GETTING CAUGHT IN RENEWED 
WARFARE, ANNAN SAID THAT THE UN HAD RIDDEN OUT THE MOST 
DANGEROUS PERIOD AND THAT WHILE THERE WERE STILL PERILS, 
NATO TROOPS WOULD FACE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT 
SITUATION; THERE WAS NOW AGREEMENT BY ALL SIDES TO A PEACE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

AGREEMENT.  JANVIER SAID \"THE WAR WAS OVER,\" HOWEVER THE 
FIGHTING IS NOT.  BIH WAS STILL DANGEROUS AND THAT MEANT 
THERE WOULD BE LOSSES WHICH TROOP CONTRIBUTING NATIONS 
MUST ACCEPT.  JANVIER EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THERE 
WOULD BE NO LARGE SCALE COMBAT BECAUSE NATO FORCES WOULD 
BE A DETERRENT TO ANY GROUP TRYING TO START A FIGHT. 
HOWEVER, HE WARNED, THERE WOULD BE INCIDENTS AND 
RESISTANCE BY SOME ELEMENTS ON BOTH SIDES AS THEY WITHDREW 
FROM AREAS CURRENTLY UNDER THEIR CONTROL. 
 
7.  (C) THE CODEL ASKED  HOW MUCH CONTROL MILOSEVIC COULD 
BE EXPECTED TO EXERT OVER THE BOSNIAN SERB MILITARY CHAIN 
OF COMMAND.  ANNAN ASSURED THEM THAT MILOSEVIC HAD 
SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT THAT SINCE BOSNIA WAS ENTERING 
A PERIOD OF PEACE, MILOSEVIC MUST COMMENT CAUTIOUSLY IN 
ORDER TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM WAR CRIMINALS. 
 
8.  (C) THE CODEL WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE ROLE OF 
GENERAL MLADIC AND WHO WOULD REPLACE HIM.  JANVIER OPINED

ABOUT THE MUJAHADEEN AND THE THREAT TO U.S. INTERESTS. 
ANNAN SAID THAT THERE WERE ONLY AN ESTIMATED 700 PRESENT 
IN BIH, INTEGRATED INTO BOSNIAK UNITS. HE SAID IT WAS THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOBH TO GET THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY 
IN THE ONE MONTH SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT. 
 
------------------------------ 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TUDJMAN 
------------------------------ 
 
9.  (C) WITH HIS TYPICAL HISTORICAL SWEEP, PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN TOLD THE CODEL THAT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IN THE 
FORMER YUGOSLAVIA WAS THE CLASH OF WESTERN, EASTERN, AND 
MUSLIM CIVILIZATIONS.  THE UNEQUAL BALANCE OF FORCES AMONG 
THEM WAS THE REASON FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF YUGOSLAVIA, BUT 
NOW A NEW BALANCE WAS BRINGING AN END TO THE WAR AND THE 
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN CROATIA AND SERBIA.  AT 
DAYTON, HE SAID, IT WAS OBVIOUS THE SERBS WANTED AN 
AGREEMENT BECAUSE THEY KNEW THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO WIN IF 
THE WAR CONTINUED.  TUDJMAN ANSWERED CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
DANGER TO U.S. FORCES BY SAYING THAT WHILE SPORADIC 
FIGHTING IS LIKELY, THE SERBS\' DESIRE FOR A SOLUTION WOULD 
TRANSLATE INTO NO SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION TO IFOR. 
 
10.  (C) ASKED ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE FORCE, TUDJMAN 
RESPONDED THAT A LARGE FORCE WAS NOT NEEDED IN EASTERN 
SLAVONIA (ALTHOUGH HE EXPECTED U.S. PARTICIPATION AT THE 
HEAD OF THE TRANSITIONAL ADMINISTRATION), BECAUSE THE 
SERBS HAVE AGREED TO REINTEGRATION.  BOSNIA REQUIRED A 
LARGE PRESENCE, HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE DEEP DIVIDE 
BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND SERBS.  WITHOUT A LARGE FORCE, NEITHER 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SIDE WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS.  HE SAID THAT UNDER 
CURRENT CONDITIONS THE 5:2:2 ARMS RATIO (FRY:CROATIA:B-H) 
WAS ACCEPTABLE, HOWEVER, A DIFFERENT RATIO MIGHT BE 
NECESSARY LATER. 
 
11.  (C) CODEL MEMBERS ASKED TUDJMAN ABOUT THE MUJAHADEEN 
PRESENCE AND IF THE GOC WOULD ASSIST IN THEIR 
IDENTIFICATION AND REMOVAL. TUDJMAN SAID IT WAS NOT KNOWN 
HOW MANY ARE PRESENT IN BOSNIA, PERHAPS 3-4,000. HE HAD 
LITTLE DOUBT, HOWEVER, THAT THEY WOULD LEAVE SINCE THEY 
COMMANDED LITTLE TRUST ON THE PART OF LOCAL MUSLIMS.  HE 
OPINED THAT THEY WOULD NOT OPPOSE THE OVERWHELMING FORCE 
OF IFOR.  DEFENSE MINISTER SUSAK ADDED THAT THE GOC WOULD 
\"HELP THE MUJAHADEEN LEAVE.\" 
 
12.  (C) TUDJMAN SAID THAT THE GOC WOULD COOPERATE WITH 
THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL AS LONG AS THE PROCEEDINGS 
REMAINED UNBIASED.  HE ASSURED THE CODEL THAT THE GOC 
WOULD EXERT LEVERAGE OVER THE BOSNIAN CROATS TO STOP 
LOOTING AND BURNING IN AREAS THAT ARE DUE TO BE RETURNED 
TO THE BOSNIAN SERBS.  HE ADDED THAT TENSIONS IN BIH ARE 
COMPLEX AND THAT ALTHOUGH ISOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
CONTINUE, THE BOSNIAKS AND CROATS HAD SUCCEEDED IN 
PREVENTING WIDER CONFLICT THROUGH THE FEDERATION. 
 
13.  (C) WHEN ASKED WHY THE U.S. SHOULD PARTICIPATE ON THE 
GROUND AND NOT JUST PROVIDE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND AIR 
POWER, TUDJMAN SAID THAT THE U.S. WAS THE LAST REMAINING 
SUPERPOWER AND MUST BE THE FOUNDATION FOR A PEACEFUL 
SOLUTION; THAT IS A ROLE THAT CANNOT BE ESCAPED. THE 
TROUBLES OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA SHOULD BE A EUROPEAN

COURTESY CALL ON THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES VLATKO PAVLETIC.  DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON 
THE BALKANS PEACE AGREEMENT AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF 
IMPLEMENTATION.  PAVLETIC SAID THAT THE AGREEMENT OFFERS

BUSINESS, INCLUDING CREATING A CIVIL SOCIETY, THE RETURN 
OF A MULTI-ETHNIC SOCIETY, AND A RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM 
OF THOSE WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED 
THAT PEACE WILL NOT BE REAL AND HEALING CANNOT BEGIN UNTIL 
A FINAL ACCOUNTING IS DONE AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR 
CRIMES -- ON ALL SIDES -- HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.0N DECEMBER 14 AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH PAID A COURTESY 
CALL ON THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
VLATKO PAVLETIC (CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION -- HDZ). 
PAVLETIC FOCUSED HIS COMMENTS ON THE SIGNING OF THE 
BALKANS PEACE AGREEMENT IN PARIS AND NOTED THAT, AS 
DIFFICULT AS THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS WAS, IMPLEMENTATION 
WILL BE HARDER.  HE SAID THAT THE CRUEL WAR OF THE LAST 
FIVE YEARS HAS BROUGHT A PEACE THAT THAT IS ALMOST AS 
CRUEL TO ITS VICTIMS.  HE LAMENTED THAT WHILE THE VIOLENCE 
HAS ENDED, HATRED AND INTOLERANCE PERSIST.  A DIFFICULT 
JOB LIES AHEAD TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR CROATS, SERBS, 
AND MUSLIMS TO LIVE TOGETHER AGAIN.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, 
THAT FINDING A FORMULA TO BUILD TRUST WILL BE MORE

DIFFICULT THAN FINDING THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO REBUILD 
VUKOVAR. 
 
3.PAVLETIC ADDED THAT THE PEACE AGREEMENT OFFERS THE 
BASIS FOR ALL THREE ETHNIC GROUPS TO RESOLVE THEIR 
DIFFERENCES.  HOWEVER, THE ENTIRE FORMULA COULD PROVE 
UNWORKABLE IF ONE PARTY VIOLATES IT.  HE SAID THIS WAS A 
SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO LEADERS IN SECTOR EAST WHO HAVE 
PUBLICLY INTERPRETED THE AGREEMENT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE 
GOC (NOTE: LEADERS IN EASTERN SLAVONIA HAVE SAID THAT 
CROATIAN DISPLACED PERSONS WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED TO RETURN 
WHEN SERBS BEGIN TO COME BACK TO FORMER SECTORS NORTH AND 
SOUTH).  PAVLETIC WARNED THAT IF SUCH ATTITUDES PERSIST, 
THE GOVERNMENT AND HDZ WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN 
CONTINUED PUBLIC OR PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE 
AGREEMENT.  (PAVLETIC ALSO UNDERLINED THAT THE OPPOSITION 
PARTIES\' WERE SEEKING AN IDEAL SOLUTION AND SAID THAT ONLY 
THE HDZ, WITH A REALISTIC VIEW OF THE PROBLEM AT HAND, 
CARRIED THE VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE AGREEMENT.)  EVEN WITHOUT 
THE UNHELPFUL STANCE OF SOME EASTERN SLAVONIAN LEADERS, 
IMPLEMENTATION WILL NOT BE EASY OR SWIFT.  THERE COULD 
HAVE BEEN NO PEACE WITHOUT THE U.S. INITIATIVE AND BECAUSE 
OF ITS INFLUENCE, PAVLETIC STRESSED, IT IS VITAL FOR 
CONTINUED U.S. ASSISTANCE IN IMPLEMENTATION.  PAVLETIC 
SAID IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO REINTRODUCE LAW AND ORDER, 
SINCE FORMER INSTITUTIONS HAVE VANISHED WITH THE MASS 
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND LOSS OF PROPERTY. 
 
4.THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THERE IS MUCH UNFINISHED 
BUSINESS, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT, 
CREATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY, THE RETURN OF MULTI-ETHNIC

SOCIETY, AND A RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO HAVE 
DISAPPEARED.  HE STRESSED THAT PEACE WILL NOT BE REAL AND 
HEALING CANNOT BEGIN UNTIL A FINAL ACCOUNTING IS DONE AND 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR CRIMES -- ON ALL SIDES -- HAVE 
BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  THE AMBASSADOR THANKE 
D PAVLETIC 
FOR HIS SUPPORT OF THE DAYTON AGREEMENT AND SAID THAT 
WHILE IT DID NOT GIVE CROATIA EVERYTHING IT WANTED, 
CROATIA MET MORE OF ITS GOALS THAN THE OTHER PARTIES IN 
THE CONFLICT.  THE AGREEMENT GUARANTEES CROATIA\'S 
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY WITHIN ITS INTERNATIONALLY 
RECOGNIZED BORDERS AND, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BOSANSKA 
POSAVINA, ALMOST ALL BOSNIAN CROATS LIVE IN THE 
FEDERATION.  HE NOTED THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE AN 
AGREEMENT THAT FULLY SATISFIES ONE SIDE, THAT PEACE 
REQUIRES COMPROMISES. EVEN THOUGH THE CROATS OF BOSANSKA 
POSAVINA ARE NOT IN THE FEDERATION, THEY STILL HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO RETURN, RECOVER PROPERTY, AND VOTE.  BY VOTING 
THEY COULD CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THE SERB ENTITY.

PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY WITH A POWERFUL PRESIDENCY. 
PRESIDENT FRANJO TUDJMAN, ELECTED IN 1992, SERVES AS HEAD 
OF STATE AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES.  HE 
CHAIRS THE INFLUENTIAL NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY 
COUNCIL, AND APPOINTS THE PRIME MINISTER, WHO LEADS THE 
GOVERNMENT.  PRESIDENT TUDJMAN\'S PARTY, THE CROATIAN 
DEMOCRATIC UNION (HDZ), HOLDS THE MAJORITY OF SEATS IN 
BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.  A NEW GOVERNMENT WAS NAMED IN 
NOVEMBER AFTER MULTI-PARTY ELECTIONS WERE HELD FOR THE 
LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT.  GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE WEAKENS 
THE NOMINALLY INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY.  THE ENORMOUS 
CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS OF THE PRESIDENCY, THE MILITARY 
OCCUPATION OF LARGE SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE 
OVERWHELMING DOMINANCE OF ONE POLITICAL PARTY TEND TO 
STIFLE THE EXPRESSION OF DIVERSE VIEWS.  THE HDZ HAS RULED 
CROATIA SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN 1991 AND THE PARTY HAS 
SOUGHT TO ENTRENCH ITS AUTHORITY IN THE LEGISLATURE AND 
THE JUDICIARY, AND AT THE COUNTY AND MUNICIPALITY LEVELS 
OF GOVERNMENT. 
 
CROATIA MILITARILY TOOK BACK CONTROL OF THE TERRITORY 
WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED FOR FOUR YEARS BY BREAKAWAY SERBS. 
ONLY THE FORMER SECTOR EAST REMAINS OUTSIDE EFFECTIVE 
GOVERNMENT CONTROL, ALTHOUGH BOTH PARTIES SIGNED AN 
AGREEMENT IN MID-NOVEMBER TO BRING THIS AREA UNDER 
COMPLETE GOVERNMENT CONTROL AFTER A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD OF 
ONE TO TWO YEARS.  IN MARCH, THE UNITED NATIONS PROTECTIVE 
FORCE (UNPROFOR) MANDATE WAS MODIFIED TO INCLUDE 
MONITORING OF THE INTERNATIONAL BORDERS OF CROATIA, AND AN 
INCREASED PRESENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS IN THE UN 
PROTECTED AREAS.  THE MISSION WAS RENAMED THE UNITED

NATIONS CONFIDENCE RESTORATION OPERATION (UNCRO).  THE 
GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED MILITARY OFFENSIVES ON THREE REBEL 
SERB-HELD ZONES IN MAY AND AUGUST AND RECOVERED THE 
TERRITORY.  UNHCR ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED 
EIGHTY THOUSAND SERB REFUGEES FLED INTO SERB-CONTROLLED 
BOSNIA AND SERBIA/MONTENEGRO DURING THE TWO CAMPAIGNS. 
THE MOST FLAGRANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS DURING THE PAST 
YEAR IN CROATIA WERE COMMITTED DURING AND AFTER THESE 
OPERATIONS.  ABUSES ALSO CONTINUED IN REBEL SERB-HELD 
AREAS.  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EXPELLED CROAT AND MUSLIM 
REFUGEES CONTINUED TO ARRIVE FROM SERBIA AND BOSNIA. 
 
THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR OVERSEES THE POLICE WHILE THE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OVERSEES THE ARMED FORCES (HV).  THE 
NATIONAL POLICE HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL 
SECURITY, BUT IN TIMES OF DISORDER, E.G. DURING AND AFTER 
THE MAY AND AUGUST OFFENSIVES, THE GOVERNMENT MAY CALL ON 
THE ARMY TO PROVIDE SECURITY.  BOTH THE POLICE AND ARMY 
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXTERNAL SECURITY.  CIVILIAN 
AUTHORITIES GENERALLY MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE 
PROFESSIONAL SECURITY FORCES.  HOWEVER, OFFICIAL PERSONNEL 
FROM EACH SERVICE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNIFICANT ABUSES 
COMMITTED IN THE RECLAIMED TERRITORIES.  CIVIL POLICE HAVE 
NO AUTHORITY OVER MILITARY POLICE OR OVER UNIFORMED 
MILITARY PERSONNEL.  IN SERB-CONTROLLED AREAS, THE WELL- 
ARMED POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES CONTINUED THEIR PATTERN 
OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AGAINST BOTH NON-SERBS AND SERBS. 
 
CROATIA\'S ECONOMY IS SLOWLY CONVERTING FROM CENTRALIZED 
SELF-MANAGEMENT TO A MARKET-BASED, PRIVATE FREE ENTERPRISE 
SYSTEM.  INDUSTRY IS LARGELY STATE-OWNED.  AGRICULTURE IS

MOSTLY IN PRIVATE HANDS.  FAMILY-OWNED SMALL ENTERPRISES 
ARE MULTIPLYING.  THE STABILIZATION PROGRAM KEPT INFLATION 
LOW THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  THE CONTINUED OCCUPATION OF THE 
EASTERN AREA BY REBEL SERBS, THE MASSIVE REFUGEE PROBLEM, 
AND THE TWO MILITARY OFFENSIVES ALL LIMITED ECONOMIC 
RECOVERY.  THE SLOW MARKET TRANSITION AND THE WAR ECONOMY 
CONTRIBUTE TO POLARIZING ECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN SOCIETY. 
IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE WORLD BANK, THE IMF AND THE 
EBRD HAVE BEGUN PROGRAMS IN CROATIA WHICH WILL ASSIST IN 
REBUILDING THE ECONOMY AND BRING IN FOREIGN INVESTORS. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT GENERALLY RESPECTED THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ITS 
ETHNIC CROAT CITIZENS.  HOWEVER, PROFOUND PROBLEMS AND 
NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS EXISTED.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
RECORD WORSENED WITH RESPECT TO MINORITY GROUPS, 
ESPECIALLY ETHNIC SERBS.  THE BULK OF VIOLENT ABUSES 
OCCURRED IN THE RECONQUERED REGIONS, AFTER THE MILITARY 
AND THE POLICE OPERATIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO 
ESTABLISH ADEQUATE CIVIL AUTHORITY TO CONTROL VENGEFUL 
RENEGADE ARSONISTS, LOOTERS, AND MURDERERS WHO OPERATED 
WITH IMPUNITY IN THE RECLAIMED AREAS MONTHS AFTER THE 
OFFENSIVES HAD ENDED.  IT SOUGHT TO LEGALIZE AND

AFTER THE MILITARY ACTIONS, IT APPEARED LESS GENUINELY 
INTERESTED IN CREATING CONFIDENCE RESTORING MEASURES WITH 
THE SERBIAN COMMUNITY, OR EVEN IN MAINTAINING A SERB 
ETHNIC PRESENCE IN CROATIA.  THE SECURITY FORCES TURNED A

EFFECTIVELY SOUGHT OUT OR PUNISHED MANY OF THOSE INVOLVED, 
EXCEPT IN A FEW TOKEN CASES.  THE GOVERNMENT TEMPORARILY 
SUSPENDED KEY PROVISIONS OF THE NATIONAL MINORITIES LAW IN 
SEPTEMBER AND STILL HAS NOT ESTABLISHED THE PROVISIONAL 
HUMAN RIGHTS COURT AS MANDATED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN 
1992.  SPECIFIC ABUSES COMMITTED INCLUDED ETHNIC-BASED 
KILLINGS, ARBITRARY DETENTION AND TORTURE, RESTRICTIONS OF 
MOVEMENT AND ON REPATRIATION, MASS DESTRUCTION AND 
CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY, DENIAL OF FAIR AND EXPEDITIOUS 
TRIALS, AND INFRINGEMENTS ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE 
PRESS. 
 
THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN 
AREAS UNDER REBEL SERB CONTROL.  THE POLICE AND MILITARY 
FORCES CONTINUED TO USE VIOLENCE, MURDER, INTIMIDATION, 
AND DISPLACEMENT AGAINST MINORITIES TO SETTLE INCOMING 
SERB REFUGEES AND ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF ETHNIC CLEANSING. 
SUCH CONDITIONS PREVAILED EVEN AFTER THE LOSS OF THREE 
REGIONS TO GOVERNMENT FORCES.  IN MAY, PROVOKED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT ATTACK ON THE FORMER SECTOR WEST, \"REPUBLIC OF 
SERBIAN KRAJINA (RSK) PRESIDENT\" MARTIC ORDERED THE 
BOMBING OF CIVILIAN CENTERS IN FREE CROATIA, INCLUDING 
ZAGREB.  AT LEAST SIX CIVILIANS DIED IN THESE INCIDENTS. 
RESIDENTS OF THE \"RSK\" WERE SUBJECT TO A CONTROLLED PARA-

UNCRO OFFICIALS REGISTERED 300-500 REPORTS OF KILLINGS IN 
RECLAIMED PARTS OF CROATIA.  MOST WERE ETHNICALLY 
MOTIVATED, AND OCCURRED LONG AFTER THE MILITARY OFFENSIVES 
WERE OVER.  ONLY IN THE MOST PUBLIC CASES WERE EFFECTIVE 
INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT AND PERPETRATORS PUNISHED, 
MOSTLY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE FROM INTERNATIONAL 
AUTHORITIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS.  AMONG THOSE 
IMPLICATED IN THE KILLINGS WERE CIVILIANS, CIVIL POLICE 
AND ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL, ESPECIALLY MEMBERS OF 
THE NON-PROFESSIONAL \"HOME GUARD\" BRIGADES.  TWO INCIDENTS 
NOTE PARTICULAR MENTION.  THE CORPSES OF SEVEN ELDERLY 
CIVILIANS WERE FOUND IN LATE AUGUST SHOT, SLAUGHTERED, AND 
BURNED IN THE VILLAGE OF GRUBORI.  THE OLDEST VICTIM WAS 
90 YEARS OLD.  WITNESSES SAW UNIFORMED SPECIAL POLICE AND 
HV AT THE SCENE.  AT FIRST, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CLAIMED 
THE CIVILIANS WERE CAUGHT IN A CLASH BETWEEN HV AND ENEMY 
TROOPS.  MONTHS LATER, A FEW CROATS WERE ARRESTED FOR THE 
MURDER OF THESE CIVILIANS AND WERE STILL UNDER 
INVESTIGATION AT THE END OF THE YEAR.  IN A SECOND 
INCIDENT, ON SEPTEMBER 28, IN THE VILLAGE OF VARIVODE, 
UNCRO MONITORS FOUND THE BODIES OF NINE ELDERLY SERBS, 
SHOT TO DEATH.  13 INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED FOR THE 
INCIDENT.  AT THE END OF THE YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED 
IT HAD INVESTIGATED 26 MURDERS, AND RESOLVED 15 CASES, 
CHARGING A TOTAL OF 20 INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING THREE 
SOLDIERS AND ONE POLICEMAN.

SERBS IN THE OCCUPIED AREAS ALSO COMMITTED ETHNICALLY 
MOTIVATED KILLINGS WITHIN THE SECTORS AND ALONG THE 
CONFRONTATION LINE, WITH A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF 
VICTIMS BEING NON-SERBS.  IN JUNE, THREE CROAT GARBAGE 
COLLECTORS WERE KIDNAPPED BY EAST SLAVONIAN SERBS DURING A 
REGULAR RUN TO THE OSIJEK CITY DUMP INSIDE THE SEPARATION 
ZONE.  TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE RELEASED, BUT SERB AUTHORITIES 
IN ERDUT EVENTUALLY ADMITTED THAT THE THIRD, FRANJO IVOS, 
WAS KILLED.  NO SUSPECT WAS EVER APPREHENDED, AND LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES INSIST THAT THE BODY WAS LOST.  IN OCTOBER, 
SERB SNIPERS FROM THIS SECTOR KILLED TWO CROATS IN 
BELISCE.  REBEL SERBS TARGETED UN PERSONNEL ALSO.  A 
KENYAN UNCRO SOLDIER WAS SHOT DEAD IN MAY IN SECTOR SOUTH. 
IN JANUARY IN SECTOR EAST, ONE RUSSIAN BATTALION SOLDIER 
AND THREE LOCAL SERBS WERE SHOT UNDER UNCLEAR 
CIRCUMSTANCES, POSSIBLY INVOLVING BLACK MARKET ACTIVITY. 
IN SEPTEMBER, 4 DANISH UN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED NEAR DVOR 
AS BOSNIAN SERBS DELIBERATELY TARGETED A UN OBSERVATION 
POST ACROSS THE UNA RIVER IN CROATIA.  HV UNITS HAD 
ATTEMPTED TO CROSS THE RIVER, AND FIRE WAS EXCHANGED

YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY).  AFTER MANY OF THE BODIES WERE 
IDENTIFIED, THEY WERE RELEASED INTO THE CUSTODY OF FAMILY 
MEMBERS.  BASED ON EYE-WITNESS REPORTS, THE GOVERNMENT 
CHARGED INDIVIDUAL REBEL SERBS WITH MURDER, SOME OF WHOM 
WERE TRIED IN ABSENTIA. 
 
B.  DISAPPEARANCE 
 
THERE WERE FEW NEW CASES OF DISAPPEARANCES REPORTED.  AT 
YEAR\'S END, THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED MORE THAN 2,800 CASES 
OF MISSING PERSONS STILL UNRESOLVED FROM THE 1991-1992 
WAR.  SOME PROGRESS WAS MADE IN REMOVING NAMES FROM THE 
LIST OF THE MISSING AS A RESULT OF PRISONER AND BODY 
EXCHANGES, AND IDENTIFICATIONS MADE OF CORPSES EXHUMED IN 
THE RECLAIMED AREAS.  AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF CASES OF 
MISSING SERBS REMAINED OPEN AT THE END OF THE YEAR AS A 
RESULT OF THE TWO GOVERNMENT OFFENSIVES.  THE GOVERNMENT 
MADE NO PUBLIC EFFORT TO INVESTIGATE THESE CASES. 
 
C.  TORTURE AND OTHER CRUEL, INHUMAN, OR DEGRADING 
TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT 
 
THE CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS TORTURE OR CRUEL OR DEGRADING 
PUNISHMENT, BUT IN CERTAIN CASES, GOVERNMENT FORCES 
CONTINUED TO COMMIT SUCH ABUSES.  SECURITY FORCES AT 
CERTAIN PRISONS BEAT AND MISTREATED PRISONERS DURING 
DETENTION AND INTERROGATION.  AFTER BOTH OFFENSIVES, 
FOREIGN OBSERVERS SAW THE WOUNDS OF REBEL SERB DETAINEES 
WHO COMPLAINED OF SUCH TREATMENT AT DETENTION CENTERS, IN 
VARAZDIN IN MAY FOR EXAMPLE, AND OTHER SITES.  SUCH CASES 
WERE NOT ROUTINE, AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

TORTURE IN CROATIAN JAILS.  MOST SERB DETAINEES 
INTERVIEWED BY INTERNATIONAL MONITORS REPORTED GOOD 
TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF THEIR JAILERS.  THERE WERE NO 
REPORTS OF ABUSES OR MISTREATMENT OF COMMON CRIMINALS 
ARRESTED AND DETAINED IN CROATIAN JAILS. 
 
EXCEPT FOR THE SHORT-TERM DETENTION FACILITIES USED TO 
HOUSE CIVILIANS ROUNDED UP AFTER THE MILITARY ACTIONS, 
DETENTION FACILITIES GENERALLY MEET ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF 
CLEANLINESS, NUTRITION, AND AMENITIES.  JAILS ARE CROWDED, 
BUT NOT TO EXCESS, AND FAMILY VISITS AND ACCESS TO COUNSEL 
ARE AVAILABLE.  DETAINED REBEL SERBS ARRESTED FOR ARMED 
REBELLION WERE MAINLY HELD IN MILITARY PRISONS, AS WITH 
MOST SECURITY PRISONERS.  AFTER THE AUGUST OFFENSIVE, THE 
GOVERNMENT INCREASINGLY RESTRICTED ACCESS TO THESE SERB 
PRISONERS BY UNCRO AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS. 
 
PRISON CONDITIONS IN THE SERB-CONTROLLED AREAS ARE 
RELIABLY REPORTED TO BE ABYSMAL.  HARSH TREATMENT OF NON- 
SERBS IS COMMONPLACE, AND SERBIAN \"AUTHORITIES\" DO NOT 
PUNISH ABUSERS.  IN MARCH, A BRITISH CITIZEN OF CROATIAN 
DESCENT WAS DETAINED FOR A MONTH IN KNIN AND TORTURED WITH 
ELECTRIC IMPLEMENTS.  TWO OF THE THREE GARBAGE COLLECTORS 
MENTIONED IN SECTION 1.A COMPLAINED OF TORTURE AND OTHER 
MISTREATMENT DURING THEIR DETAINMENT.  ARRESTEES OFTEN 
REPORT BEING BEATEN AND ROBBED BY LOCAL POLICE AND 
PARAMILITARY FORCES, AS WELL AS SUBJECTED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL 
TORTURE, SUCH AS DEATH THREATS.

THE CONSTITUTION CONTAINS PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE LEGAL 
RIGHTS OF ALL ACCUSED, BUT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ALWAYS 
RESPECT THESE RIGHTS IN PRACTICE.  THE GOVERNMENT 
FREQUENTLY ABUSES PRETRIAL AND INVESTIGATIVE DETENTION. 
THE MOST PROMINENT CASE OF ARBITRARY ARREST OCCURRED IN 
LATE OCTOBER WHEN 15 PERSONS, MOSTLY PROMINENT ETHNIC 
SERBS, WERE DETAINED FOR ESPIONAGE.  THE COURTS HAD 
NEITHER RELEASED NOR CHARGED ANY OF THEM WITH A CRIME BY 
THE END OF THE YEAR.  ARMY SPECIAL FORCES TROOPS 
ARBITRARILY ARRESTED SEVERAL DOZEN REBEL BOSNIAN MUSLIM 
REFUGEES IN THE KUPLJENSKO CAMP AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND 
FORCIBLY REPATRIATED THEM TO BOSNIA.  REFUGEE 
ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUED TO REPORT SIMILAR INSTANCES IN 
WHICH MUSLIM REFUGEES WERE ARBITRARILY DETAINED AND 
THREATENED WITH FORCIBLE EXPULSION. 
 
GOVERNMENT POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES ROUNDED UP THE 
REMAINING CIVILIAN POPULATIONS OF THE FORMERLY OCCUPIED 
AREAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER BOTH OFFENSIVES.  THE VERY OLD, 
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WERE CONFINED IN COLLECTION CENTERS 
OUTSIDE THE WAR ZONE, SOME FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.  GOVERNMENT

REBELLION TO COVER THE PERIOD FROM AUGUST 17, 1990, TO MAY 
10, 1995.  REBEL SERBS APPREHENDED IN THE AUGUST OFFENSIVE 
WERE NOT AMNESTIED. 
 
POLICE NORMALLY SEEK ARREST WARRANTS BY PRESENTING 
EVIDENCE OF PROBABLE CAUSE TO AN INTERROGATING MAGISTRATE. 
POLICE MAY ARREST A SUSPECT WITHOUT A WARRANT IF THEY 
BELIEVE HE MIGHT FLEE, DESTROY EVIDENCE, OR COMMIT OTHER 
CRIMES.  SUCH CASES ARE NOT UNCOMMON.  THE POLICE THEN 
HAVE 24 HOURS IN WHICH TO JUSTIFY THEIR DECISION BEFORE 
THE LOCAL INTERROGATING MAGISTRATE. 
 
AFTER ARREST, THE LAW STATES PERSONS MUST BE GIVEN ACCESS 
TO AN ATTORNEY OF THEIR CHOICE WITHIN 24 HOURS; IF THEY 
HAVE NO ATTORNEY, AND ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME FOR WHICH 
THE SENTENCE IS OVER TEN YEARS IMPRISONMENT OR MORE, THE 
INTERROGATING MAGISTRATE WILL APPOINT ONE FROM A LIST OF 
PUBLIC DEFENDERS.  IF THE SENTENCE IS UNDER 10 YEARS, THE 
DETAINEE CAN REQUEST COURT-APPOINTED COUNSEL IF HE SO 
CHOOSES.  THE COURT WILL APPOINT COUNSEL AFTER CHARGES ARE 
LEVIED FOR THE TRIAL.  THE INTERROGATING JUDGE MUST, 
WITHIN THREE DAYS OF THE ARREST, DECIDE WHETHER SUFFICIENT 
CAUSE EXISTS TO HOLD THE ARRESTEE IN CUSTODY PENDING 
FURTHER INVESTIGATION.  THE JUDGE MUST JUSTIFY THE 
DECISION IN WRITING, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF DETENTION 
ORDERED.  THESE DECISIONS MAY BE APPEALED, EITHER 
IMMEDIATELY OR LATER IN THE DETENTION PERIOD.  THE USUAL 
PERIOD OF INVESTIGATIVE DETENTION VARIES FROM A FEW DAYS 
TO A FEW WEEKS BUT BY LAW MAY BE AS LONG AS TWO YEARS.

OFFICIALLY CHARGED.  ACCUSED PERSONS HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
HAVE THEIR ATTORNEY PRESENT DURING THE ENTIRE 
INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS DURING ANY APPEAL OF 
INVESTIGATIVE DETENTION. 
 
IN PRACTICE, ARRESTEES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS BOUND OVER FOR 
INVESTIGATION UNLESS IT IS CLEAR NO CASE EXISTS AGAINST 
THEM.  ONCE THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE, PERSONS ARE 
USUALLY RELEASED ON THEIR OWN RECOGNIZANCE PENDING TRIAL, 
UNLESS THE CRIME IS A MAJOR OFFENSE, THE ACCUSED IS 
CONSIDERED A PUBLIC DANGER, OR THE COURT BELIEVES HE MAY 
FLEE.  THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR POSTING BAIL AFTER CHARGES 
ARE BROUGHT, BUT THE PRACTICE IS NOT COMMON.  POLICE WILL 
SOMETIMES RETAIN THE ACCUSED\'S PASSPORT TO PREVENT HIM 
FROM LEAVING THE COUNTRY. 
 
BY LAW, REBEL SERBS DETAINED AFTER THE TWO OFFENSIVES 
COULD BE HELD UNDER INVESTIGATION, PENDING CHARGES, FOR 
SIX MONTHS.  IN MANY CASES, \"RSK\" SERBS ARRESTED FOR ARMED 
REBELLION DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL, 
NOR WERE THEY INFORMED IN A TIMELY MANNER BY THE COURTS OF 
THEIR RIGHTS.  FEW WERE APPOINTED A PUBLIC DEFENDER UNTIL 
MONTHS AFTER THEIR ARREST; SOME SAW COUNSEL ONLY ONCE OR 
TWICE, USUALLY ONLY DURING A COURT HEARING.  ALTHOUGH THEY 
HAD BEEN IN INVESTIGATIVE DETENTION FOR SIX MONTHS, MANY 
SUCH SERBS WERE TRIED AND CONVICTED IN TWO DAYS IN 
NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, HAVING SPOKEN TO THEIR LAWYER ONLY 
ONCE.  THE CROATIAN BAR ASSOCIATION WARNED THE MAGISTRATES

IN REBEL SERB-CONTROLLED AREAS, VIRTUALLY NO SAFEGUARDS 
EXIST AGAINST ARBITRARY DETENTION, AND SERB FORCES 
CONTINUED TO USE DETENTION AS AN INTIMIDATION TACTIC. 
SERB FORCES COMMONLY ARRESTED CIVILIANS IN THE \"SEPARATION 
ZONE.\"  THE INCIDENT INVOLVING THE OSIJEK GARBAGE 
COLLECTORS REMAINED THE MOST PUBLICIZED DURING THE YEAR. 
IN JANUARY, A FRENCH JOURNALIST WAS ARRESTED FOR ILLEGALLY 
CROSSING INTO \"RSK\" TERRITORY, AND WAS SENTENCED BY A 
MILITARY COURT TO 2.5 YEARS IN PRISON.  IN NOVEMBER, TWO 
AMERICANS WERE DETAINED FOR THREE DAYS BY VUKOVAR LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES FOR TAKING PICTURES.  UNTIL AUGUST, RESIDENTS 
OF THE \"BIHAC POCKET\" IN WESTERN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA WERE 
SOMETIMES ARBITRARILY DETAINED, WHILE TRANSITTING SERB- 
HELD TERRITORY TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. 
 
THE CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS EXILE OF CROATIAN CITIZENS. 
SERBS CAPTURED DURING THE OFFENSIVES AND NOT ORIGINATING 
FROM CROATIAN TERRITORY WERE SUBJECT TO DEPORTATION AFTER 
THEY SERVED THEIR SENTENCES FOR WAR CRIMES.

THE CROATIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM CONSISTS OF MUNICIPAL AND 
DISTRICT COURTS, A SUPREME COURT, AND A CONSTITUTIONAL 
COURT.  THE SUPREME COURT, OR HIGH JUDICIAL COUNCIL (WITH 
A PRESIDENT AND 14 MEMBERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE LEGAL 
COMMUNITY), APPOINTS JUDGES AND PUBLIC PROSECUTORS.

JUDICIAL TENURE CAN BE PERMANENT.  THE UPPER HOUSE OF 
PARLIAMENT NOMINATES PERSONS FOR MEMBERSHIP ON THE HIGH 
JUDICIAL COUNCIL, AND THE LOWER HOUSE ELECTS MEMBERS TO 
EIGHT-YEAR TERMS.  THE ELEVEN JUDGES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
COURT ARE ELECTED TO EIGHT-YEAR TERMS IN THE SAME MANNER. 
 
THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IS NOT FREE OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE OR 
ETHNIC BIAS.  DURING REGULARLY-HELD JUDICIARY ELECTIONS IN 
1994, A DISPUTE AROSE WHICH RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
EXTENT OF POLITICAL CONTROL OVER THE JUDICIARY.  IN 
FEBRUARY, THE STATE JUDICIAL COUNCIL, CONTROLLED BY THE 
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AND THE MINISTRY OF ADMINISTRATION, 
ELECTED NEW JUDGES FOR THE SUPREME COURT, BUT THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ORDERED THE NOMINATING PROCEDURE BE 
REDONE, CLAIMING THE COUNCIL HAD NOT APPOINTED QUALIFIED 
PERSONNEL.  THE CHIEF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE MILAN VUKOVIC 
LOST HIS APPOINTMENT.  MINISTER OF JUSTICE IVICA CRNIC 
DISPUTED THE ELECTION PROCEDURES AND RESIGNED IN MARCH, 
SAYING HE DID NOT WISH TO BE INVOLVED IN AN UNDEMOCRATIC 
AND TOTALITARIAN PROCEDURE. 
 
IN SEPTEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT REPEALED CERTAIN PROVISIONS 
OF THE 1992 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON MINORITIES, WHICH 
INCLUDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROVISIONAL COURT OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS, A COURT WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN ESTABLISHED (SEE 
SECTION 3).  EMERGENCY MEASURES ESTABLISHED IN 1991 ARE 
STILL BEING APPLIED.  THESE ORDERS PROVIDE FOR THE 
SUSPENSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL REMEDIES IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
AND GIVE THE SIX-COURT MILITARY LEGAL SYSTEM JURISDICTION 
OVER A LARGE NUMBER OF CASES INVOLVING CIVILIANS.

ALTHOUGH THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR THE RIGHT TO A FAIR

INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS REPORTED DAILY 
INCIDENTS OF LOOTING, BURNING, AND THREATS MADE TO THE

NO SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR THESE CLAIMS. 
 
IN AUGUST, AN OFFICIAL DECREE PLACED UNDER GOVERNMENT 
ADMINISTRATION THE ABANDONED PROPERTY OF CROATIAN CITIZENS 
WHO HAD FLED THE COUNTRY FOR SERBIA OR OTHER SERB- 
CONTROLLED AREAS SINCE THE 1991 WAR.  THE GOVERNMENT 
CLAIMED THIS ACT WAS NECESSARY TO GIVE RETURNING CROAT 
REFUGEES DECENT SHELTER, AND TO PROTECT THE PROPERTIES 
FROM LOOTING AND DESTRUCTION.  VIEWED INTERNATIONALLY AS A 
THINLY VEILED ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THE RETURN OF CROATIAN 
SERBS TO THEIR HOMES, THIS DECREE WAS IMMEDIATELY PASSED 
INTO LAW BY THE HDZ-CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE.  OWNERS WERE 
ALLOWED A 90-DAY FILING PERIOD TO RECLAIM THEIR PROPERTY, 
BUT THE COMPLEX PROCEDURES, REQUIRING A CLAIMANT TO 
PRODUCE CITIZENSHIP DOCUMENTS, WHICH COULD NOT BE OBTAINED 
OUTSIDE CROATIA, AND TO FILE HIS CLAIM IN CROATIA, WERE 
PRACTICAL IMPEDIMENTS.  ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT EVENTUALLY 
SET UP PROCESSING CENTERS IN BELGRADE AND OTHER NEARBY 
CAPITALS, THE PROCEDURE REMAINED SLOW. 
 
MILITARY AND CIVIL POLICE CONTINUED TO CARRY OUT FORCED 
EVICTIONS, INVOLVING HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES OF ALL 
NATIONALITIES.  IN OTHER CASES, CROATIAN REFUGEES, OFTEN 
WITH THE APPEARANCE OF OFFICIAL COUNTENANCE, FORCIBLY 
ENTERED THE HOMES OF ETHNIC SERBS AND OTHER MINORITIES WHO 
LIVED FOR YEARS IN FAMILY APARTMENTS, BUT WHO WERE 
THEMSELVES NOT LISTED AS THE OFFICIAL TENANT.  ALTHOUGH 
SUCH EVICTIONS WERE OFTEN DECLARED ILLEGAL IN COURT,

OCCUPYING THIS HOUSING OR NOT. 
 
FORCED EVICTIONS OF ETHNIC SERBS, CROATS AND OTHERS FROM 
FORMER YUGOSLAV NATIONAL ARMY (JNA) APARTMENTS CONTINUED. 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE REVOKED TENANT RIGHTS OF 
INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE APARTMENTS FOR DECADES IN A 
SEEMINGLY ARBITRARY MANNER.  REFERRING TO PROPERTY LAWS 
WHICH REMOVE TENANCY RIGHTS AS A RESULT OF ANY SIX-MONTH 
ABSENCE OR IF THE TENANT WAS RULED TO HAVE ACTED AGAINST 
THE INTERESTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, THE MINISTRY 
GRANTED SOLDIERS TENANCY OF THESE OCCUPIED FLATS.  THE 
SOLDIERS FREQUENTLY TOOK RESIDENCES BY FORCE OF ARMS, 
EITHER EVICTING THE CURRENT TENANTS, OR FORCING THEM TO 
CO-HABITATE.  IN NOVEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT PASSED A LAW 
ALLOWING FORMER JNA APARTMENTS TO BE PRIVATIZED.  UNLIKE 
OTHER PRIVATIZATIONS, LEGAL TENANTS HAD RESTRICTED RIGHTS 
TO PURCHASE THEIR APARTMENTS, AND THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE 
WAS NOT GUARANTEED.  FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE REGISTERED 
TENANT WERE NOT ALLOWED PURCHASE RIGHTS, NOR WERE 
INDIVIDUAL SUSPECTED OF ARMED REBELLION OR WAR CRIMES.

IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF MAY 1, SPECIAL POLICE UNITS 
AND GOVERNMENT TROOPS INITIATED \"OPERATION FLASH,\" AN 
ATTACK TO LIBERATE OCCUPIED WESTERN SLAVONIA.  ANNOUNCED 
AS A \"LIMITED POLICE ACTION\" TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE 
ZAGREB-LIPOVAC HIGHWAY, GOVERNMENT FORCES GAINED EFFECTIVE 
CONTROL OF MOST OF THE AREA WITHIN ONE DAY AND A CEASEFIRE 
WAS REACHED ON THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 3.  HV TROOPS 
RESTRICTED THE MOVEMENT OF UNCRO FORCES AND SURROUNDED 
MOST UN BASES, INCLUDING A JORDANIAN BASE ALONG THE 
HIGHWAY AND A NEPALESE BASE AT PUSTARA.  ALTHOUGH TENSIONS 
HAD BEEN BUILDING FOR MANY WEEKS, THE DIRECT PRETEXT FOR

RESULT WAS 6 DEAD AND MORE THAN 130 WOUNDED.  \"RSK 
PRESIDENT\" MILAN MARTIC PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD 
PERSONALLY ISSUED THE ORDER FOR THE CAPITAL TO BE SHELLED. 
DAYS LATER, HE THREATENED AGAIN TO \"FLATTEN THE CITY\" AND 
KILL \"ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE.\"  IN OCTOBER, MARTIC 
WAS INDICTED WITH TWO OTHER \"RSK OFFICIALS\" BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA 
(ICTY) FOR THIS INCIDENT. 
 
OVER SEVEN THOUSAND REFUGEES FLED IN FRONT OF ADVANCING HV 
TROOPS OVER THE ONLY BRIDGE ACROSS THE SAVA RIVER TO SERB- 
HELD BOSNIA.  GOVERNMENT FORCES LEFT THIS ROAD OPEN TO 
ALLOW THE INHABITANTS TO EVACUATE.  A POCKET OF SERBS 
UNABLE TO LEAVE THE NORTHERN PART OF THE SECTOR WAS 
SURROUNDED BY HV FORCES AND SURRENDERED. 
 
ON AUGUST 4, GOVERNMENT FORCES LAUNCHED THE LARGER SCALE 
\"OPERATION STORM\" ON THE FORMER SECTORS NORTH AND SOUTH, 
AND GAINED EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE AREA WITHIN FIVE DAYS. 
THE ATTACK BEGAN WITH THE SHELLING OF THE SERB STRONGHOLD 
OF KNIN, A CIVILIAN TARGET.  REBEL SERB FORCES ORGANIZED A 
WEAK COUNTEROFFENSIVE AND QUICKLY PREPARED AN EVACUATION 
OF BOTH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL FROM THE AREA. 
\"PRESIDENT OF THE RSK PARLIAMENT,\" RAJKO LEZAJIC, LATER 
ACCUSED MARTIC AND MILITARY COMMANDER MRKSIC OF ORDERING 
THE EVACUATION OF THE POPULATION.  BOSNIAN SERBS SHELLED 
SEVERAL CITIES IN GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED CROATIA ALTHOUGH 
ZAGREB WAS NOT HIT.

INDISCRIMINATE DEATHS OF MANY CIVILIANS AND UN PERSONNEL 
DURING BOTH ACTIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT LATER CLAIMED THAT 
188 SERBS HAD BEEN KILLED DURING THE MAY ACTION, OF WHICH 
54 DEATHS WERE CIVILIAN.  AFTER THE AUGUST ATTACK, THE 
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT 116 SERBS AND 42 CROAT CIVILIANS 
HAD BEEN KILLED, AS WELL AS 402 \"RSK\" SOLDIERS AND 211 HV 
TROOPS.  UNCRO ESTIMATES OF THESE FIGURES ARE HIGHER. 
DURING OPERATION FLASH, THE UN REPORTED 30 CIVILIAN 
CORPSES NEAR THE VILLAGE OF NOVI VAROS.  EYEWITNESS 
REPORTED SOLDIERS SHOOTING AT FLEEING REFUGEES. 
ON AUGUST 8 NEAR DVOR, CROATIAN AIR FORCE SORTIES FIRED ON 
A REFUGEE COLUMN FLEEING INTO BOSNIA.  THE GOVERNMENT 
CLAIMED THAT THE SERBS WERE MOVING TANKS AND OTHER HEAVY 
EQUIPMENT IN THE SAME COLUMN.  ONE WOMAN DIED FROM WOUNDS 
SHE RECEIVED WHEN A REFUGEE COLUMN WAS STONED ON AUGUST 9 
BY ON-LOOKERS IN SISAK.  THAT SAME DAY, A BRITISH 
JOURNALIST WAS KILLED AND TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED NEAR 
VRGINMOST, MISTAKENLY TARGETED AS SERBS BY HV FORCES. 
 
BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT ARMY (ABH) FORCES ENTERED CROATIA 
DURING THE AUGUST OFFENSIVE WITH CROATIAN GOVERNMENT 
CONSENT.  WHILE ESCORTING A REFUGEE COLUMN IN AUGUST, 
UNCRO PERSONNEL WITNESSED THE DELIBERATE SHOOTING OF 9-11 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED SERB REFUGEES BY 
IRREGULAR UNITS OF THE ABH.  ABH FORCES ALSO SHELLED A 
SERB REFUGEE COLUMN IN DONJI ZIROVAC ON AUGUST 8. 
 
DURING THE OFFENSIVES, THE UN SUFFERED CASUALTIES FROM 
BOTH SIDES.  HV FORCES THREATENED AND CAPTURED UN 
OBSERVATION POSTS, HOLDING SOME PERSONNEL HOSTAGE FOR 
SEVERAL HOURS.  THESE FORCES LOOTED MANY ABANDONED UN

COMPOUNDS.  WHEN HV TROOPS ENTERED KNIN IN AUGUST, THEY 
PREVENTED ANYONE FROM LEAVING THE UN COMPOUND TO MONITOR 
THE FIGHTING.  A DANISH UNCRO SOLDIER WAS USED BY REBEL 
SERBS AS A HUMAN SHIELD AND WAS KILLED BY HV FIRE.  THE 
OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ORDER TO SHOOT WAS ARRESTED 
AND A MURDER CHARGE IS PENDING AGAINST HIM.  HV FORCES 
THREW A GRENADE INTO A JORDANIAN BATTALION BUNKER, 
RESULTING IN 4-6 DEATHS.  (SEE SECTION 1.A FOR DEATHS 
FOLLOWING THE ACTION.) 
 
BOTH POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
LOOTING AND THE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE 
MINING AND BURNING OF HOUSES.  THIS DESTRUCTION CONTINUED 
MANY MONTHS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE ACTION AND WAS 
LATER COMMITTED BY ROVING CIVILIANS AS WELL.  (SEE SECTION 
1.F FOR MORE DETAILS.) 
 
ELSEWHERE, ISOLATED CEASEFIRE VIOLATIONS CAUSED AT LEAST 
THREE FATALITIES.  OCCASIONAL SHELLING OCCURRED THROUGHOUT 
THE YEAR FROM BOSNIAN SERB POSITIONS BORDERING CROATIA, 
MOST COMMONLY TARGETING ZUPANJA, OSIJEK, AND THE DUBROVNIK 
AREA.  DUBROVNIK AIRPORT WAS SHELLED IN APRIL, MAY,

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WITH THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS 
INCREASING IN THE REMAINING SERB-HELD TERRITORIES AFTER

A.  FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS 
 
THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND 
EXPRESSION, SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING FREEDOM OF THE PRESS 
AND OTHER MEDIA OF COMMUNICATION, SPEECH, AND PUBLIC 
EXPRESSION, AND FREE ESTABLISHMENT OF INSTITUTIONS OF 
PUBLIC COMMUNICATION.  IN PRACTICE, GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE 
ON THE MEDIA THROUGH STATE OWNERSHIP OF MOST PRINT AND 
BROADCAST OUTLETS LIMITS THESE FREEDOMS.  IN ADDITION, 
GOVERNMENT INTIMIDATION INDUCES SELF-CENSORSHIP. 
JOURNALISTS ARE SOMETIMES RELUCTANT TO CRITICIZE THE 
GOVERNMENT IN PUBLIC FORUMS FOR FEAR OF HARASSMENT, JOB 
LOSS, INTIMIDATION, OR BEING LABELED AS DISLOYAL TO 
CROATIA.

CONTROLLING INTEREST IN TWO OF FOUR NEWS DAILIES, AND SOME 
WEEKLY NEWSPAPERS.  ALTHOUGH THESE STATE-CONTROLLED OR 
HEAVILY STATE-INFLUENCED MEDIA FREQUENTLY CARRY REPORTAGE 
CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT, THEY MAINTAIN AN OVERALL 
EDITORIAL SLANT FAVORABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE 
GOVERNING PARTY, THE HDZ.  BOTH THE BROADCAST AND PRINT 
MEDIA ALSO OFTEN EXCLUDE NEWS REPORTS THAT PUT CROATIA OR 
ITS GOVERNMENT IN AN UNFAVORABLE LIGHT.  HRT HAS SEVERAL 
TIMES NOT BROADCAST STATEMENTS MADE IN HIGHLY PUBLIC FORA 
BY THE U.S. AMBASSADOR ON THE NEED TO OBSERVE HUMAN AND 
MINORITY RIGHTS; ON AT LEAST ONE OCCASION, IT EMPLOYED 
SOME CREATIVE EDITING OF A REPORT FEATURING THE AMBASSADOR 
TO DO SO.  EACH OF THE OPPOSITION PARTIES IS ALLOCATED 
FOUR MINUTES OF TELEVISION TIME PER WEEK.  ACCESS BY THE 
PARTIES TO THE PRINT MEDIA IS MINIMAL, WITH OCCASIONAL 
COVERAGE OF PRESS CONFERENCES AND INTERVIEWS. 
 
DURING OCTOBER\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, ONE HOUR OF FREE 
BROADCAST TIME ON NATIONAL TELEVISION WAS MADE AVAILABLE 
TO EACH OF THE REGISTERED POLITICAL PARTIES FOR THE PRE- 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  TIME SLOTS WERE DRAWN BY LOT.  PAID 
ADVERTISING ON NATIONAL TELEVISION WAS, IN THEORY, 
AVAILABLE, BUT STATE-CONTROLLED CROATIAN RADIO AND 
TELEVISION (HRT) REFUSED TO RUN ADVERTISING SPOTS FROM ONE 
OF THE MAJOR OPPOSITION PARTIES ON THE GROUNDS THAT SOME - 
-UNSPECIFIED-- INFORMATION IN THE AD WAS INACCURATE AND 
THAT THE AD DID NOT MAKE CLEAR WHAT PARTY WAS PLACING IT. 
THE HDZ HAD AN ADVERTISING BUDGET THAT DWARFED THAT OF ITS 
RIVALS, AND IT MADE HEAVY USE OF THIS BUDGET TO BUY AIR 
TIME ON THE NATIONAL, STATE-CONTROLLED TELEVISION NETWORK 
DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.

A FEW NEWSPAPERS CONTINUE TO GUARD THEIR INDEPENDENCE, 
INCLUDING THE DAILY NOVI LIST IN RIJEKA, THE WEEKLY 
GLOBUS, THE INTELLECTUAL BIMONTHLY JOURNAL ERASMUS, THE 
SATIRICAL WEEKLY FERAL TRIBUNE, AND THE WEEKLY ARKZIN, 
PUBLISHED BY THE \"ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN.\"  SOME EXTREMIST 
PUBLICATIONS, WITH A VIRULENTLY ANTIGOVERNMENT SLANT, CAN 
BE PURCHASED AT NEWSSTANDS, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE A VERY 
SMALL CIRCULATION.  THE HIGHLY POPULAR AND OFTEN CRITICAL 
FERAL TRIBUNE WAS SUBJECTED TO A 50 PERCENT TURNOVER TAX 
IN 1994, THOUGH IN MARCH 1995, UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE EU, 
THE TAX WAS LIFTED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. 
 
GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE OVER THE RECENTLY-PRIVATIZED 
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, COUPLED WITH STIFF VALUE-ADDED TAXES 
LEVIED AT SEVERAL POINTS DURING THE PRODUCTION PROCESS, 
ALSO HAS AN IMPACT ON PRESS FREEDOM.  IT IS CLAIMED, 
THOUGH DIFFICULT TO PROVE, THAT THE FEW PRINTING COMPANIES 
ABLE TO REPRODUCE NEWSPAPERS DO NOT CHARGE THE PRO- 
GOVERNMENT MEDIA FOR THEIR SERVICES;  IT IS ALSO WIDELY 
BELIEVED THAT TISAK, THE NATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR FOR ALL 
NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES, REMOVES INDEPENDENT JOURNALS

CROATIA HAS THREE NATIONAL TELEVISION CHANNELS, AND A 
LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN ZAGREB WHICH REACHES A QUARTER 
OF THE POPULATION OF CROATIA.  ZAGREB-BASED CHANNELS ONE, 
TWO, AND THREE ARE PART OF THE OFFICIAL CROATIAN RADIO AND 
TELEVISION ENTERPRISE (HRT), HEADED BY A WELL-KNOWN HDZ 
MEMBER.  REGIONAL STATIONS OPERATE IN ZADAR, SPLIT, 
VINKOVCI, AND OSIJEK. 
 
IN AUGUST, PARLIAMENT ANNOUNCED THE FIRST ALLOCATIONS OF 
FREQUENCIES FOR PRIVATE RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS 
UNDER THE JULY 1994 BROADCAST LAW.  NO FREQUENCIES FOR 
NATION-WIDE PRIVATE BROADCASTERS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED FOR 
EITHER RADIO OR TELEVISION.  TWO OF FOUR PLANNED 
FREQUENCIES FOR TELEVISION AND FOUR OF TWENTY PLANNED 
FREQUENCIES FOR RADIO AT THE COUNTY (ZUPANIJA) LEVEL WERE 
ASSIGNED.  NINE OF FIFTEEN PLANNED FREQUENCIES FOR 
MUNICIPAL LEVEL PRIVATE TELEVISION WERE ASSIGNED AND 88 OF 
111 PLANNED FREQUENCIES FOR MUNICIPAL RADIO BROADCASTERS 
WERE ASSIGNED. 
 
THE BROADCAST LAW MANDATES THAT ONE PARLIAMENTARY MEMBER 
OF THE COUNCIL FOR CROATIAN TELEVISION BE AN ETHNIC 
MINORITY REPRESENTATIVE, BUT THIS PERSON HAS NOT YET BEEN 
APPOINTED.

IN SERB-CONTROLLED REGIONS, FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS 
VIRTUALLY DID NOT EXIST.  WITH MARTIAL LAW STILL IN 
EFFECT, THERE WERE NO GUARANTEES OF PRESS AND OTHER 
FREEDOMS, AND THE AUTHORITIES CONTROLLED THE TONE AND 
CONTENT OF THE MEDIA. 
AT THE YEAR\'S END IN THE ONE REMAINING SERB-OCCUPIED AREA, 
ONE TELEVISION STATION BROADCASTS FROM STUDIOS IN BELI 
MANASTIR AND VUKOVAR.  A FEW LOW-POWERED LOCAL RADIO 
STATIONS BROADCAST FROM BARANJA AND EASTERN SLAVONIA. 
GOVERNMENT RADIO AND TELEVISION SIGNALS ARE RECEIVED IN 
THESE AREAS AS WELL. 
 
AMONG THE FIRST ACTS THE GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK AFTER ITS 
FORCES RETOOK THE KRAJINA WAS TO BEGIN BROADCASTING 
PROGRAMMING FROM THE HRT REGIONAL STATION IN KNIN. 
 
ACADEMIC FREEDOM IS GENERALLY RESPECTED IN CROATIA. 
 
B.  FREEDOM OF PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY AND ASSOCIATION 
 
THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THAT ALL CITIZENS HAVE THE RIGHT 
TO PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY AND ASSOCIATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF 
CITIZENS\' INTERESTS OR THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, 
POLITICAL, NATIONAL, CULTURAL, AND OTHER CONVICTIONS AND 
OBJECTIVES AND THE GOVERNMENT RESPECTS THEM IN PRACTICE. 
IN SERB-CONTROLLED AREAS, HOWEVER, THESE RIGHTS WERE NOT 
RESPECTED.  IN EARLY DECEMBER, OVER 2000 CROAT REFUGEES 
GATHERED IN ZAGREB FOR THE LARGEST ANTI-GOVERNMENT 
DEMONSTRATION SINCE INDEPENDENCE TO PROTEST THE DAYTON 
PEACE AGREEMENT AND THE LOSS OF THEIR HOMES IN BOSNIAN

POSAVINA TO BOSNIAN SERBS.  THE DEMONSTRATION WAS MOSTLY 
PEACEFUL WITH A FEW ISOLATED INCIDENTS OF POLICE 
HARASSMENT OF PROTESTORS. 
 
C.  FREEDOM OF RELIGION 
 
THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE AND 
RELIGION AND FREE PUBLIC PROFESSION OF RELIGIOUS AND OTHER 
CONVICTIONS.  THERE IS NO STATE RELIGION.  ALL RELIGIOUS 
COMMUNITIES ARE FREE TO CONDUCT PUBLIC SERVICES AND TO 
OPEN AND RUN SOCIAL AND CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.  ROMAN 
CATHOLICISM, EASTERN ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY, AND ISLAM ARE 
THE MAJOR FAITHS IN CROATIA, AND THERE IS ALSO AN ACTIVE 
JEWISH COMMUNITY.  THE MAJORITY OF PRACTICING CROATS ARE 
ROMAN CATHOLIC, AND THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES AN OPTION OF 
CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS. 
 
THERE ARE NO FORMAL RESTRICTIONS ON RELIGIOUS GROUPS. THE 
MAIN MOSQUE IN CROATIA IS IN ZAGREB, WHERE IT SERVES NOT 
ONLY AS A RELIGIOUS CENTER BUT ALSO AS A SOCIAL AID OFFICE 
FOR THE LARGE BOSNIAN MUSLIM REFUGEE POPULATION.  CROATIAN

EARLIER CAUSED RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS TO BE TARGETS OF 
VIOLENCE.  THE SERBIAN ORTHODOX CATHEDRAL IN DOWNTOWN 
ZAGREB IS OPEN, AND SEVERAL OTHER ORTHODOX CHURCHES AND 
MONASTERIES OPERATE FREELY IN GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
CROATIA.  INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS SAID THE FEW 
ORTHODOX PRIESTS AND NUNS WHO REMAINED IN CROATIA AFTER 
THE 1991 WAR REPORTED GENERALLY GOOD RELATIONS WITH THEIR 
CATHOLIC NEIGHBORS.  AFTER THE MILITARY OFFENSIVES ON 
WESTERN SLAVONIA AND THE KRAJINA REGION, MILITARY AND 
POLICE FORCES GUARDED MOST OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES TO 
PREVENT THEM FROM BEING LOOTED OR DESTROYED.  HOWEVER, 
SOME SERB CHURCHES WERE REPORTED BY INTERNATIONAL 
OBSERVERS TO BE LOOTED OR DAMAGED. 
 
MOST CATHOLIC CHURCHES IN THE SERB-OCCUPIED AREAS HAVE 
BEEN DESTROYED.  IN EASTERN SLAVONIA, ONLY ONE ACTIVE 
CROATIAN CATHOLIC PRIEST REMAINS.  A SLOVAK CATHOLIC 
PRIEST ARRIVES REGULARLY FROM SERBIA TO HOLD MASSES. 
 
MOST REQUESTS FOR CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR EXEMPTION FROM 
MILITARY SERVICE WERE GRANTED.  THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR 
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR STATUS IN THE SERB-OCCUPIED AREAS. 
 
D.  FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WITHIN THE COUNTRY, FOREIGN 
TRAVEL, EMIGRATION, AND REPATRIATION 
 
THE CONSTITUTION GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR THESE RIGHTS, WITH 
CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.  ALL PERSONS LEGALLY IN THE COUNTRY 
MUST REGISTER THEIR RESIDENCE WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. 
UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE GOVERNMENT MAY 
LEGALLY RESTRICT THE RIGHT TO ENTER OR LEAVE THE COUNTRY

IF NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE \"LEGAL ORDER, HEALTH, RIGHTS,

THE GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO ALLOW THE REPATRIATION OF THE 
ALMOST 200,000 REFUGEES WHO FLED THE FIGHTING TO THEIR 
HOMES IN THE FORMER SECTORS NORTH, SOUTH, AND WEST. 
10,000 TO 15,000 SERBS FILED APPLICATIONS TO RETURN BASED 
ON HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS, BUT ONLY 400 WERE APPROVED 
BY MID-NOVEMBER.  APPROVAL WAS GRANTED ONLY IF THE 
INDIVIDUAL HAD IMMEDIATE FAMILY IN CROATIA WHO WOULD 
SPONSOR HIS RETURN, AND COULD PROVE LEGAL RESIDENCE IN 
CROATIA BEFORE INDEPENDENCE.  APPROVED RETURNEES DID NOT 
RETURN TO THEIR HOMES IN THE FORMER OCCUPIED AREAS, BUT 
WERE HOUSED BY THEIR FAMILY SPONSOR. 
 
THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR ALL 
JOURNALISTS AND ALL MALE CITIZENS FROM AGE 18 THROUGH 55, 
IN THE CITIES AND AREAS CLOSE TO THE CONFRONTATION LINES. 
THE PRESS HAS REPORTED ON SUCH RESTRICTIONS.  JOURNALISTS, 
AS WELL AS OTHERS, MUST REQUEST PERMISSION TO ENTER THE 
CONFLICT ZONES. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RESTRICTIONS 
ON THE MOVEMENT OF REFUGEES, DISPLACED PERSONS, OR 
NATIONAL MINORITIES RESIDENT IN CROATIA.  MANY REFUGEES 
WERE HOUSED IN REMOTE LOCATIONS WITH LITTLE OR NO MEANS OF 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT.  THERE WERE SEVERAL CONFIRMED CASES OF 
FORCED RETURN OF REFUGEES TO BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, 
ESPECIALLY FROM AMONG THE REBEL MUSLIM REFUGEES FROM THE 
BIHAC CANTON OF BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA.  THE GOVERNMENT TRIED

UNLESS TRANSIT TO A THIRD COUNTRY WAS ASSURED.  HOWEVER, 
IN MID-SUMMER, LARGE NUMBERS OF CROAT AND MUSLIM REFUGEES, 
FORCED FROM SERB-HELD NORTHERN BOSNIA BY ETHNIC CLEANSING 
CAMPAIGNS, ENTERED CROATIA VIA A CROSSING OVER THE SAVA 
RIVER AT DAVOR.  ETHNIC CROATS WERE REGISTERED AS 
REFUGEES, AS WELL AS A FEW MUSLIMS, BUT MOST MUSLIM 
REFUGEES WERE IMMEDIATELY REPATRIATED TO GOVERNMENT- 
CONTROLLED AREAS OF WESTERN BOSNIA. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT ALSO CONTINUED TO RELOCATE REFUGEES FROM 
COASTAL TOURIST FACILITIES TO INLAND AREAS AND TO 
RECOVERED TERRITORIES.  OFTEN THIS POLICY MET RESISTANCE 
FROM REFUGEE GROUPS WHO DID NOT WANT TO MOVE TO BUILDINGS 
WITH FEW MODERN LIVING FACILITIES OR TO BE UPROOTED AND 
SEPARATED FROM THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY HAD SPENT THE 
LAST FOUR YEARS. 
 
THE FORCES OF BOSNIAN MUSLIM REBEL LEADER FIKRET ABDIC 
WERE DEFEATED BY THE BOSNIAN ARMY IN SEPTEMBER AND OVER 
20,000 PEOPLE LEFT THE MUNICIPALITY OF VELIKA KLADUSA IN 
NORTHERN BOSNIA AND ENTERED CROATIA.  THE GOVERNMENT

SECTION 3.  RESPECT FOR POLITICAL RIGHTS: THE RIGHT OF 
CITIZENS TO CHANGE THEIR GOVERNMENT 
 
CROATIA IS A MULTIPARTY DEMOCRACY IN WHICH ALL CITIZENS 18 
YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE BY SECRET 
BALLOT.  THE PRESIDENT, ELECTED FOR 5 YEARS, EXERCISES 
SUBSTANTIAL POWER, AUTHORITY, AND INFLUENCE BUT IS 
CONSTITUTIONALLY LIMITED TO TWO TERMS.  PARLIAMENT IS 
COMPRISED OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE HOUSE OF 
ZUPANIJE OR COUNTIES, AND THE CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION 
(HDZ) HOLDS A MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES.  ITS LEADER, 
PRESIDENT FRANJO TUDJMAN, WAS REELECTED IN 1992. 
 
IN ELECTIONS FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, HELD IN 
OCTOBER 1995, THE HDZ AGAIN WON A MAJORITY OF THE SEATS, 
AND ELEVEN OTHER PARTIES ALSO WON SEATS.  THE NATIONAL 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE FAULTED THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN ON A 
NUMBER OF POINTS: THE ELECTORAL LAW WAS HASTILY PRESENTED 
TO PARLIAMENT AND PASSED AFTER ONLY A FEW HOURS OF DEBATE; 
A SPECIAL FRANCHISE FOR CROATS LIVING PERMANENTLY OUTSIDE 
THE COUNTRY WAS CREATED TO INCLUDE ALMOST 10 PERCENT OF 
SEATS IN THE PARLIAMENT; ETHNIC SERB REPRESENTATION -- 
BASED ON PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION -- WAS DROPPED FROM 13 
SEATS TO 3 WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF A CENSUS;  CHANGES IN 
CONSTITUENCY BOUNDARIES APPEARED TO BE ARBITRARY AND NON- 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

TRANSPARENT; STATE-RUN MEDIA RESTRICTED CRITICISM OF 
GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES; AND THE ELECTION 
ADMINISTRATION WAS FLAWED, FOR EXAMPLE VOTER LISTS WERE 
OFTEN INACCURATE AND OUTDATED.  THE FRANCHISE FOR THE 
DIASPORA INCLUDED ETHNIC CROATS BORN AND RESIDENT IN 
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, BUT EXCLUDED ETHNIC SERBS BORN IN 
CROATIA, WHO WERE LIVING AS REFUGEES IN SERB-CONTROLLED 
AREAS.  RULES FOR ACCESS TO THE STATE-OWNED MEDIA 
RESTRICTED OPPOSITION PARTIES\' ABILITY TO CRITICIZE 
GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES. 
DURING THE ELECTION, POLLING PROCEDURES WERE GENERALLY 
ADHERED TO.  POLL WORKERS AND OFFICIALS DEMONSTRATED A 
GENUINE COMMITMENT TO CONDUCTING THEIR WORK FREELY AND 
FAIRLY, AND USUALLY WELCOMED THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN 
OBSERVERS.  THERE WERE, HOWEVER, INCONSISTENCIES AMONG 
POLLING PLACES, MOST OF WHICH PROBABLY RESULTED FROM A 
LACK OF TRAINING FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS.  PROBLEMS WHICH 
APPEARED DURING VOTING APPEAR TO HAVE CURTAILED THE RIGHTS 
OF SOME MINORITY VOTERS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WERE REPORTS 
THAT SOME SERBS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE FOR THE 
STATE-WIDE PARTY LIST IF THEY EXERCISED THEIR RIGHT TO 
VOTE ON THE SPECIAL LIST FOR ETHNIC SERB CANDIDATES AS 
ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW.  CASES OF PASSIVE INTIMIDATION OF 
SERB VOTERS WERE ALSO REPORTED BY ELECTION OBSERVERS. 
REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST MINORITY GROUPS (INCLUDING SERBS) 
COMPLAINED THAT VOTERS HAD BEEN LEFT OFF THE VOTER ROLLS 
OR HAD BEEN MISCLASSIFIED AS CROATS, AN ERROR WHICH 
APPLIED TO AN ESTIMATED 10 PERCENT OF MINORITY VOTERS IN 
SOME AREAS, ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF ELECTION OBSERVERS.

BY WOMEN OR MINORITIES IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS, THEY ARE 
REPRESENTED IN ONLY SMALL NUMBERS IN PARLIAMENT, THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AND COURTS.  FIFTEEN WOMEN HOLD SEATS IN 
PARLIAMENT; ONE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE OF COUNTIES. 
CROATIAN ELECTION LAW REQUIRES REPRESENTATION FOR 
MINORITIES IN PARLIAMENT, WITH PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION 
FOR ANY MINORITY THAT MAKES UP MORE THAN EIGHT PERCENT OF 
THE POPULATION.  UNDER THE ELECTION LAW PASSED BY 
PARLIAMENT IN OCTOBER 1995, THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES 
OF THE SERBIAN COMMUNITY WAS REDUCED FROM 13 TO THREE ON 
THE BASIS OF ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF SERBS WHO FLED 
CROATIA AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY WOULD NOT RETURN, 
DISREGARDING THE FACT THAT THEY REMAINED CROATIAN 
CITIZENS.  TWO OF THE THREE SEATS WERE WON BY THE SERBIAN 
PEOPLE\'S PARTY AND ONE SEAT WENT TO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC 
ACTION PARTY. 
 
IN SEPTEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT TEMPORARILY RESCINDED 
ARTICLES 21 AND 22 (AND ALL OTHER RELEVANT ARTICLES) OF 
THE 1992 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. 
THESE LAWS HAD ESTABLISHED SELF-GOVERNING SPECIAL STATUS

MAJOR LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS INCLUDE THE CROATIAN

SOLIDARITY COMMITTEE, THE DALMATIAN COMMITTEE FOR HUMAN

SERBIAN PEOPLES\' PARTY AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC UNION

FORUM, ANOTHER LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP, FOCUSED PRIMARILY 
ON THE CONCERNS OF THE SERBIAN COMMUNITY.  ALL OF THESE 
GROUPS HAVE PUBLICLY CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT\'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS POLICY.  INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS 
ARE ALSO ACTIVE IN CROATIA. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT COOPERATED WITH INTERNATIONAL

STATISTICS, INFORMED OBSERVERS STATE THAT VIOLENCE AGAINST 
WOMEN, INCLUDING SPOUSE ABUSE IS COMMON, AND THAT THE

ALCOHOL ABUSE IS COMMONLY CITED AS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.

CONSTITUTIONALLY, CROATIAN SERBS ENJOY THE SAME PROTECTION 
AS OTHER SELF-IDENTIFIED ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN

EVER-PRESENT, SUBTLE, AND SOMETIMES OPEN DISCRIMINATION 
AGAINST ORTHODOX SERBS IN SUCH AREAS AS THE ADMINISTRATION 
OF JUSTICE, EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, AND THE FREE EXERCISE OF 
THEIR CULTURAL RIGHTS.  SERBS CONTINUE TO BE PARTICULARLY 
VULNERABLE TO ATTACK BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
RELUCTANCE TO PROTECT RIGOROUSLY THEIR RIGHTS.  ATTACKS 
AGAINST PROPERTY OWNED BY SERBS, OR EVEN CROATS WITH SERB- 
SOUNDING NAMES, CONTINUED IN 1995, THOUGH AT A LESSER RATE 
THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS.  SERBS IN CROATIA ALSO CONTINUED 
TO RECEIVE ANONYMOUS THREATS BY MAIL, PHONE, AND FAX, BUT 
IN FEWER NUMBERS THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS.  MANY SERBS LEFT 
GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED CROATIA DURING THE YEAR AS A RESULT 
OF THE COMBINATION OF ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION AND PHYSICAL 
THREATS, AND THE LACK OF INTEREST SHOWN BY THE GOVERNMENT 
TO CREATE CONFIDENCE RESTORING MEASURES WITH THE SERBS 
REMAINING IN THE FORMERLY OCCUPIED AREAS.

OR TRAINING IN POLICE WORK, CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROBLEM. 
AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS, THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES INVOLVING 
VIOLENCE AGAINST SERBS WENT UNPUNISHED. 
 
THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN CROATIA ALSO SUFFERED FROM ETHNIC 
DISCRIMINATION AND CROATIAN MUSLIMS AND BOSNIAN REFUGEES 
CONTINUE TO REPORT WIDESPREAD DISCRIMINATION IN MANY AREAS 
SUCH AS CITIZENSHIP AND EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT\'S PRACTICE OF DISCRIMINATING IN THE 
ISSUANCE OF CITIZENSHIP PAPERS TOWARD ETHNIC MINORITIES, 
PARTICULARLY SERBS AND MUSLIMS, DREW HARSH CRITICISM. 
HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS HAVE NUMEROUS DOCUMENTED CASES IN 
WHICH THE INTERIOR MINISTRY DENIED CITIZENSHIP PAPERS TO 
LONG-TERM RESIDENTS OF CROATIA (I.E., RESIDENT IN CROATIA 
LONG BEFORE THE COUNTRY DECLARED ITS INDEPENDENCE).  HUMAN 
RIGHTS GROUPS COMPLAIN THAT THE INTERIOR MINISTRY ALMOST 
ALWAYS BASED ITS DENIALS ON ARTICLE 26 OF THE LAW ON 
CITIZENSHIP, WHICH PERMITS IT TO DENY CITIZENSHIP PAPERS 
TO PERSONS OTHERWISE QUALIFIED TO BE CITIZENS OF CROATIA 
FOR REASONS OF NATIONAL INTEREST.  THE LAW DOES NOT 
REQUIRE THE REASONS TO BE EXPLAINED, AND HUMAN RIGHTS

ORGANIZATIONS REPORTED THAT THE POLICE CONTINUED TO REFUSE 
CITIZENSHIP APPLICATIONS WITHOUT FULL EXPLANATION. 
 
THE LAW ON CITIZENSHIP DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THOSE WITH A 
CLAIM TO CROATIAN ETHNICITY AND THOSE WITHOUT.  THE 
\"CROATIAN PEOPLE\" ARE ELIGIBLE TO BECOME CITIZENS OF 
CROATIA EVEN IF THEY DID NOT HAVE PREVIOUS CITIZENSHIP OF 
THE FORMER SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, AS LONG AS THEY

SUBMIT A WRITTEN STATEMENT THAT THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES 
CROATIAN CITIZENS.  OTHERS MUST SATISFY MORE STRINGENT 
REQUIREMENTS THROUGH NATURALIZATION IN ORDER TO OBTAIN 
CITIZENSHIP, EVEN IF THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY LAWFUL RESIDENTS 
OF CROATIA AS CITIZENS OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.  WHILE AN 
APPLICATION FOR CITIZENSHIP IS PENDING, THE APPLICANT IS 
CONSIDERED AN ALIEN, AND IS DENIED RIGHTS SUCH AS SOCIAL 
ALLOWANCES, INCLUDING MEDICAL CARE, PENSIONS, FREE 
EDUCATION, AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE CIVIL SERVICE. 
 
SERBS AND OTHER ETHNIC MINORITIES ALSO SUFFERED FROM 
ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION.  THE U.N. SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS PREVIOUSLY NOTED IN HIS REPORT THAT \"IT 
APPEARS THAT SERBS AND MUSLIMS ARE ALWAYS THE FIRST TO BE 
DISMISSED...\"  WHILE THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC SITUATION IN 
CROATIA CONTINUED TO CAUSE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT FOR ALL 
SECTORS OF SOCIETY, THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR\'S CONCERN WAS 
AMPLIFIED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF CREDIBLE REPORTS THAT SERBS 
BORE A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN IN LAYOFFS BY A BROAD 
VARIETY OF EMPLOYERS.  THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, HUMAN RIGHTS 
ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUED TO RECEIVE INQUIRIES FROM SERBS 
WHO HAD BEEN FIRED FROM THEIR JOBS AS FAR BACK AS 1992. 
WHILE IN MANY CASES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE 
PROXIMATE CAUSE FOR THE FIRING OF AN EMPLOYEE, THERE WERE 
CASES WHERE THE EMPLOYEE\'S ETHNICITY WAS THE STATED 
REASON.  IN ONE CASE, THE ONLY DOCTOR TO REMAIN IN THE 
KNIN HOSPITAL FOLLOWING OPERATION STORM WAS DISMISSED.  IN 
SOME CASES, DESPITE COURT ORDERS WHICH CONFIRMED THE 
EMPLOYEE\'S RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT OR REINSTATEMENT TO A 
PREVIOUS POSITION, THE EMPLOYER STILL REFUSED TO REHIRE 
WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN OUT OF WORK SINCE 1992.

THE ROMA MINORITY CONTINUED TO FACE SOCIETAL 
DISCRIMINATION AND OFFICIAL INACTION WHEN COMPLAINTS WERE 
FILED.  THE 1991 CENSUS SHOWS A TOTAL OF UNDER 7000 ROMA 
IN THE COUNTRY BUT COMMUNITY LEADERS NUMBER THE GROUP IN 
THE TENS OF THOUSANDS. 
 
OTHER MINORITY GROUPS -- SLOVAKS, CZECHS, ITALIANS, 
HUNGARIANS -- DID NOT REPORT SIGNIFICANT DISCRIMINATION TO 
THE SAME EXTENT AS THE SERB COMMUNITY.  AT THE START OF 
THE AUTUMN SCHOOL YEAR, ETHNIC HUNGARIAN PARENTS 
COMPLAINED THAT ONLY CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS WERE BOTH 
REGISTERED TO BE OF HUNGARIAN ETHNICITY COULD REGISTER IN 
HUNGARIAN SCHOOLS, PREVENTING MANY CHILDREN OF MIXED 
BACKGROUND FROM ATTENDING.  THE ITALIAN MINORITY IN ISTRIA 
AND OTHER ETHNIC COMMUNITIES REPORTED DISPROPORTIONATE 
NUMBERS OF MOBILIZATIONS PRIOR TO BOTH MILITARY 
OFFENSIVES, AS A TEST OF THEIR LOYALTY TO CROATIA. 
 
THE ABYSMAL TREATMENT OF NON-SERB MINORITIES IN THE SERB- 
OCCUPIED AREAS IS DISCUSSED IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS 
REPORT. 
 
SECTION 6.  WORKER RIGHTS 
 
A.  THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION 
 
ALL WORKERS, EXCEPT MILITARY AND POLICE PERSONNEL, ARE 
ENTITLED TO FORM OR JOIN UNIONS OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING 
WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  THERE IS AN ACTIVE LABOR 
MOVEMENT IN CROATIA WITH THREE NATIONAL LABOR FEDERATIONS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

AND INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATIONS OF BOTH BLUE-COLLAR AND 
WHITE-COLLAR MEMBERS.  IN GENERAL, UNIONS ARE INDEPENDENT 
OF THE GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL PARTIES. 
 
THE RIGHT TO STRIKE IS GUARANTEED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND 
IS LIMITED ONLY IN THE ARMED FORCES, POLICE, GOVERNMENT 
ADMINISTRATION, AND PUBLIC SERVICES.  STRIKES HAVE BEEN 
INFREQUENT SINCE THE END OF 1994, WITH TWO NOTABLE 
EXCEPTIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.  RAILWAY WORKERS 
WENT ON STRIKE IN DECEMBER 1994 TO PROTEST POOR SAFETY 
CONDITIONS AND LATE PAYMENT OF WAGES.  AIRLINE PILOTS WENT 
ON STRIKE FOR A FEW DAYS IN THE FALL DUE TO A WAGE 
DISPUTE.  IN THE FACE OF RELATIVE QUIESCENCE OF THE LABOR 
UNIONS, WORKERS CONTINUE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE INABILITY 
OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR GOVERNMENT-RUN INSTITUTIONS OR 
INDUSTRIES TO PAY WAGES ON TIME.  FOR EXAMPLE, TEACHERS 
WHO STRUCK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1994-95 ACADEMIC YEAR, 
CONTINUED TO PROTEST GOVERNMENT WAGE POLICY AND ON MORE 
THAN ONE OCCASION THREATENED TO RESUME STRIKE ACTIVITY. 
DESPITE STRIKES AND PROTESTS, THE GOVERNMENT HEWED CLOSELY 
TO THE AUSTERITY PROGRAM IT IMPLEMENTED IN OCTOBER 1993 AS 
PART OF ITS ECONOMIC STABILIZATION PROGRAM.  THE RAILWAY

B.  THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY 
 
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS PROTECTED BY LAW AND PRACTICED 
FREELY IN CROATIA.  IN SPRING 1995, THE CROATIAN 
PARLIAMENT PASSED A NEW LABOR CODE, WITH UNION SUPPORT, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

WHICH REVISED THE STATUTES GOVERNING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING 
CONTRACTS, PROTECTION FOR STRIKING WORKERS, AND LEGAL 
LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYERS TO CONDUCT 
\"LOCKOUTS\" DURING LABOR DISPUTES. 
 
MANY CROATIAN ENTERPRISES WHICH WERE \"SOCIALLY OWNED\" HAVE 
BEEN \"TRANSFORMED\" OR NATIONALIZED AS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS 
PRIVATIZATION.  IN THE CURRENT TRANSITION TO PRIVATIZATION 
AND A FREE MARKET ECONOMY, THE UNIONS ARE UNDER PRESSURE 
DUE TO JOB LOSSES, GENERAL UNEMPLOYMENT IN A WEAKENED 
ECONOMY, AND THEIR OWN STRUGGLE TO BECOME GENUINE FREE 
TRADE UNIONS. 
 
THE LABOR CODE, WHICH GOES INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 1996, 
DEALS DIRECTLY WITH ANTIUNION DISCRIMINATION ISSUES. 
UNIONS NOW CAN CHALLENGE FIRINGS IN COURT, AND THE NEW 
LABOR CODE DID AWAY WITH PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH ILLNESS 
HAD BEEN A VALID REASON FOR EMPLOYERS TO FIRE WORKERS.  IT 
ALSO ERASED PROVISIONS WHICH, UNDER THE OLD CODE, REQUIRED 
UNION SHOP STEWARDS TO REMAIN ON THE JOB WHILE SERVING 
FULL TIME ON WORKERS\' COUNCILS, AND GRANTED THEM THE RIGHT 
OF REINSTATEMENT WHEN SERVICE IS COMPLETED.  NEVERTHELESS, 
CROATIA\'S TRADE UNION FEDERATIONS HAVE ALLEGED THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYS STRONG-ARM TACTICS AGAINST EMPLOYEES 
INVOLVED IN LABOR DISPUTES TO FORCE THEM BACK TO WORK. 
SOME THREATS ARE ALLEGED TO INCLUDE MOBILIZATION OR \"WORK 
OBLIGATIONS,\" WHEREBY WORKERS ARE DRAFTED TO FILL 
POSITIONS. 
 
THERE ARE NO EXPORT PROCESSING ZONES IN CROATIA.

C.  PROHIBITION OF FORCED OR COMPULSORY LABOR 
 
FORCED OR COMPULSORY WORK IS CONSTITUTIONALLY FORBIDDEN. 
THERE WERE NO DOCUMENTED INSTANCES OF COERCED OR FORCED 
LABOR.  THE MINISTRY OF LABOR AND SOCIAL WELFARE IS THE 
AGENCY CHARGED WITH ENFORCING THE CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON 
COERCED OR FORCED LABOR. 
 
D.  MINIMUM AGE FOR EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN 
 
THE MINIMUM AGE FOR YOUTH EMPLOYMENT IS 15 AND IS ENFORCED 
BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOR AND SOCIAL WELFARE.  UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION, CHILDREN MAY NOT BE EMPLOYED BEFORE REACHING 
THE LEGALLY DETERMINED AGE, NOR MAY THEY BE FORCED OR 
ALLOWED TO DO WORK THAT IS HARMFUL TO THEIR HEALTH OR 
MORALITY.  WORKERS UNDER 18 ARE ENTITLED TO SPECIAL 
PROTECTION AT WORK AND ARE PROHIBITED FROM HEAVY MANUAL 
LABOR.  EDUCATION IS MANDATORY UP TO AGE 14. 
E.  ACCEPTABLE CONDITIONS OF WORK 
 
THERE ARE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE STANDARDS.  PUBLIC SERVICE 
UNIONS ARE PACESETTERS FOR THE REST OF THE WORK FORCE, AND 
THEY WERE IN THE FOREFRONT OF CONTINUED EFFORTS TO 
ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNMENT TO HONOR ITS COMMITMENTS.  AS OF 
OCTOBER, THE MINIMUM GROSS MONTHLY WAGE IN CROATIA WAS 
ROUGHLY 200 U.S. DOLLARS GROSS (1024 KUNA) AND 140 USD NET 
(694). NATIONAL REGULATIONS PROVIDE FOR A 42-HOUR 
WORKWEEK, OVERTIME PAY, A HALF-HOUR DAILY BREAK, AND A 
MINIMUM OF 18 DAYS OF PAID VACATION ANNUALLY.  IT IS 
STANDARD PRACTICE TO PROVIDE A 24-HOUR REST PERIOD DURING 
THE WORKWEEK.

SUMMARY

2.  (S) CROATIAN FM GRANIC TOLD CHARGE FINN DECEMBER 29 
THAT THE GOC WAS CONCERNED BY REPORTS FROM NEW YORK 
THAT THE U.S. WAS \"SUPPORTING\" A RUSSIAN-SPONSORED 
CONDEMNATION OF CROATIA\'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.  WAS 
THIS, HE ASKED, A CHANGE IN POLICY?  GRANIC 
ACKNOWLEDGED CROATIA HAD \"MADE MISTAKES,\" BUT ARGUED IT 
WAS WORKING HARD TO CORRECT PROBLEMS AND, MAKING CLEAR 
THERE WAS SOME SPACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS IN THE 
GOC ON THESE ISSUES, EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT A 
RESOLUTION LIKE THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE PUSHING WOULD 
DAMAGE PROSPECTS FOR CROATIA-SERBIA NORMALIZATION, 
REINTEGRATION OF EASTERN SLAVONIA, AND PEACE IN B-H. 
 
3.  (C)  CHARGE ASSURED GRANIC THERE WAS NO SHIFT IN 
U.S. POLICY, BUT RATHER CONTINUITY -- CROATIA\'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS PROBLEMS WERE AND WOULD REMAIN A SERIOUS U.S. 
CONCERN, ESPECIALLY SO LONG AS GOC STATEMENTS ABOUT 
REMEDIES WERE NOT FOLLOWED UP WITH EFFECTIVE ACTION.

4.  (U)  CHARGE WAS SUMMONED TO THE MFA DECEMBER 29 FOR 
A MEETING WITH FM GRANIC.  ALSO PRESENT WERE ASSISTANT 
MINISTER FOR BILATERAL AFFAIRS BISCEVIC, CHEF DE 
CABINET MATEK, DIRECTOR FOR NORTH AMERICA GRABAR, AND 
U.S. EMBASSY POLOFF. 
 
5. (C)  RECALLING HIS RECENT \"VERY PRODUCTIVE\" TALKS 
WITH SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER, GRANIC EMPHASIZED THAT 
CROATIA WISHED TO COOPERATE FULLY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF DAYTON, AND HAD DONE SO, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE 
ZUPANJA AREA.  (CHARGE OBSERVED THAT THIS WAS CORRECT 
AND WAS MUCH APPRECIATED.)  GRANIC ADDED THAT THE GOC 
WOULD SEND A DELEGATION TO THE DISARMAMENT TALKS IN 
VIENNA AND COOPERATE FULLY IN EFFORTS THERE.  HE NOTED 
PROGRESS IN EASTERN SLAVONIA, WITH MG KLEIN CURRENTLY 
IN ZAGREB, A UNSC RESOLUTION EXPECTED SOON, AND SOME 
PROGRESS ON THE NECESSARY TROOP CONTINGENTS.  IT HAD 
BEEN AGREED DECEMBER 27 THAT HE WOULD VISIT BELGRADE 
JANUARY 10 (WEATHER PERMITTING).  THERE WAS \"NO DOUBT\" 
THAT CROATIA WOULD COOPERATE FULLY IN THE NORMALIZATION 
PROCESS WITH SERBIA. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
HUMAN RIGHTS PRESSURE COULD DELAY NORMALIZATION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (C) IN THIS CONTEXT, HOWEVER, THE UNSYG\'S REPORT ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS MIGHT BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.  CROATIA HAD 
\"SHOWN WHAT IT IS DOING NOW,\" AND HAD TAKEN MANY STEPS 
TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT AND PREVENT FURTHER \"MISTAKES,\"

ESPECIALLY IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  THE GOC HAD MADE 
CLEAR ITS POLICY WOULD BE TO PROSECUTE ALL CRIMES.  ON 
DECEMBER 27, THE GOVERNMENT HAD \"RESOLVED THE QUESTION 
OF PROPERTY,\" AND ON DECEMBER 28 IT HAD MET TO WORK UP 
ITS \"PROPOSAL\" TO THE SABOR ON THIS.  THE HAGUE 
TRIBUNAL WAS SENDING INVESTIGATORS TO CROATIA JANUARY 
4-5 AND THEY WOULD HAVE FULL COOPERATION.

7. (C) BUT RUSSIA HAD SEIZED ON THE BOUTROS-GHALI 
REPORT TO PUSH IN THE UNSC FOR A RESOLUTION ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS IN CROATIA.  ON DECEMBER 28, THE U.S. REP HAD 
SUPPORTED THE RUSSIAN APPROACH, USING RATHER STRONG 
LANGUAGE.  \"WE KNOW THAT YOU HAD PRESSURE FROM 
MILOSEVIC,\" GRANIC SAID, BUT PRESSURE ON THE GOC NOW 
WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL.  IT WAS ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE THAT 
 
THE U.S., NOW AS IN THE PAST, OFFER \"CRITICAL 
SUGGESTIONS\" ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, WHICH STIMULATED 
DISCUSSION AND REMEDIAL ACTION.  THE GOC WAS ENTIRELY

TIME SEEMINGLY \"LED\" AN EFFORT TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE 
GOC ALONE.  GRANIC ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE U.S. 
ACTION IN NEW YORK; WAS THIS, HE ASKED, A \"CHANGE OF 
POLICY\" TOWARD CROATIA?  CHARGE, NOTING HE HAD NOT YET 
RECEIVED ANY REPORTS OF PROCEEDINGS IN NEW YORK 
DECEMBER 28, SAID U.S. POLICY ON CROATIA HAD NOT 
\"SHIFTED,\" NOR WAS IT DRIVEN BY ANY PRESSURE FROM 
MILOSEVIC.  HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES WERE A LONGSTANDING AND 
MAJOR COMPONENT OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY; SERIOUS HUMAN 
RIGHTS ABUSES HAD BEEN COMMITTED IN CROATIA, AND THE 
U.S. WOULD CONTINUE TO CALL ATTENTION TO THEM, 
ESPECIALLY SO LONG AS THERE WAS A CLEAR GAP BETWEEN 
STATED POLICY AND EFFECTIVE ACTION. 
9. (C) GRANIC CONCEDED THERE HAD BEEN A GAP BETWEEN 
POLICY AND ACTION, BUT ARGUED IT WAS BEING CLOSED. 
STEPS WERE BEING TAKEN ON THE PROPERTY ISSUE AND ON 
RETURN OF REFUGEES, THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 3,000 
REMAINING \"REAL\" APPLICANTS FOR RETURN WHOSE CASES 
REMAINED UNRESOLVED; PROCEDURES WOULD BE EXPEDITED; IT 
WAS SELF-EVIDENT THAT THOSE WHO WERE APPLYING TO COME 
BACK TO CROATIA WERE NOT WAR CRIMINALS.  BUT EASTERN 
SLAVONIA COULD NOT BE POSTPONED; DELAYS THERE WOULD

SUGGESTING POSTPONEMENT OF EASTERN SLAVONIA.  ON THE 
CONTRARY, WE WERE PUSHING HARD TO GET THE PROCESS UNDER

BY JANUARY 15.  HE NOTED THAT EASTERN SLAVONIA WOULD 
OFFER THE GOC AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE WITH

1.  THE JANUARY 2 ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE CROATIAN PRESS OF 
THE UPCOMING VISIT OF S/WCI AMBASSADOR PIERRE PROSPER 
SPARKED A USEFUL RENEWAL OF THE PUBLIC DEBATE ON 
CROATIA\'S STANDING WITH ICTY.  PRESS COMMENTARIES WERE 
MIXED.  AT ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM WAS CRITICISM OF THE 
GOVERNMENT FOR PUTTING INTEGRATION WITH NATO AND THE EU 
AT RISK BY ITS \"AUTISTIC\" APPROACH TO COOPERATION.  AT 
THE OTHER WAS CRITICISM OF THE TRIBUNAL FOR ITS DELAY IN 
SENDING A MEDICAL TEAM TO EXAMINE BOBETKO.  THE AMCIT 
ATTORNEY FOR FUGITIVE ICTY INDICTEE GENERAL ANTE 
GOTOVINA RANTED THAT HIS CLIENT WILL NEVER SURRENDER 
HIMSELF AND DERIDED THE U.S. POSITION ON ICTY AS 
\"HYPOCRITICAL\" CONSIDERING THE USG REFUSAL TO JOIN THE 
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.  GOVERNMENT RESPONSES 
GENERALLY WELCOMED THE VISIT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
EXPLAIN TO AMB. PROSPER HOW CROATIA IS COOPERATING WITH 
THE TRIBUNAL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  THE CROATIAN PRESS ON JANUARY 2 REPORTED THAT S/WCI 
AMBASSADOR PIERRE RICHARD PROSPER ANNOUNCED HIS 
INTENTION TO VISIT BELGRADE, BANJA LUKA, SARAJEVO, AND 
ZAGREB IN LATE JANUARY 2003.  CROATIAN NEWS AGENCY HINA 
ALSO REPORTED THAT AMBASSADOR PROSPER \"ACCUSED THE THREE 
COUNTRIES OF THE FAILURE TO COOPERATE WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR FORMER YUGOSLAVIA 
(ICTY).  ...  IN CROATIA, THE U.S. OFFICIAL WILL INSIST 
ON THE ARREST OF GENERALS JANKO BOBETKO AND ANTE 
GOTOVINA.  \'ALL KNOW WHERE BOBETKO IS AND HE SHOULD BE 
ARRESTED,\' PROSPER SAID.\"

AMBASSADOR FOR WAR CRIMES, PIERRE RICHARD PROSPER, AND 
DURING HIS IMPENDING VISIT TO ZAGREB, WHERE HE WILL URGE 
THE ARREST OF GENERALS SUSPECTED OF WAR CRIMES, IT WILL 
BRIEF HIM ABOUT COOPERATION WITH THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL AND 
THE CASE OF GENERAL JANKO BOBETKO.  PROSPER\'S VISIT TO 
ZAGREB LATER THIS MONTH WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
CROATIA\'S AUTHORITIES TO BRIEF HIM ABOUT COOPERATION 
WITH THE U.N. WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL, DEVELOPMENTS IN THE 
REGION SINCE HIS LAST VISIT, AS WELL AS ABOUT THE 
OUTCOME OF THE BOBETKO CASE.\" 
 
4.  IN AN ARTICLE BY ITS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, 
BRUNO LOPANDIC, ZAGREB-BASED GOVERNMENT-OWNED \"VJESNIK\" 
ON JANUARY 3 REPORTED THAT CROATIAN DIPLOMATIC SOURCES 
HAVE TOLD \"VJESNIK\" THAT \"THERE IS NOTHING DRAMATIC IN 
THE VISIT.  AMBASSADOR PROSPER\'S VISIT WILL BE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM HIM PERSONALLY ABOUT THE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH COOPERATION WITH 
THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL.  CROATIA IS NOT REFUSING TO 
COOPERATE WITH THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL AND WE WILL TELL 
AMBASSADOR PROSPER THAT CLEARLY.\" 
 
5.  THE SAME NEWSPAPER CARRIED AN ARTICLE BY ITS LEGAL 
CORRESPONDENT, VLADO RAJIC, UNDER THE HEADLINE \"WHY

6.  SPLIT-BASED GOVERNMENT-OWNED \"SLOBODNA DALMACIJA,\" 
IN AN ARTICLE BY ITS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, 
BISERA LUSIC, ALSO REPORTED ON CROATIAN DIPLOMATIC 
SOURCES WHICH STATED THAT CROATIA \"HAS NEVER GIVEN UP 
COOPERATION WITH THE HAGUE, AND LAST YEAR SIMPLY USED 
THE LEGAL POSSIBILITIES WHICH, BASED ON THE TRIBUNAL\'S 
STATUTE, WERE AT ITS DISPOSAL.  ALSO, EXECUTIVE 
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT FORGET TO MENTION THAT

COMMENTED ON AMBASSADOR PROSPER\'S ANNOUNCED VISIT. 
GRUBISA COMMENTED:  \"THE LATEST, ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 
VISIT BY PIERRE RICHARD PROSPER, AMERICAN AMBASSADOR FOR 
WAR CRIMES, AND HIS UNAMBIGUOUS CONDEMNATION OF CROATIA 
BECAUSE OF ITS FAILURE TO EXTRADITE GENERALS BOBETKO AND

AMERICAN SUPPORT.  AT THIS MOMENT, REGARDLESS OF ITS 
INVOLVEMENT IN PREPARATIONS FOR THE WAR IN THE GULF, THE 
U.S. REMAINS A SERIOUS GUARANTOR OF THE DAYTON AGREEMENT 
IMPLEMENTATION, WITHOUT WHICH THE HERITAGE OF WAR IN 
THIS AREA CANNOT BE OVERCOME, AND PEACE AND SECURITY 
AMONG FORMER YUGOSLAVIA SUCCESSOR COUNTRIES CANNOT BE 
ESTABLISHED.  THAT\'S WHY WE NEED NATO MEMBERSHIP, ONE

WEEKS IN JANUARY.\"  HE ALSO COMMENTED THAT \"WHEN ONE

ISSUE I CAN TALK ABOUT, OR SOMETHING MY COUNTRY MAKES 
DECISIONS ABOUT.  OUR STANDPOINT IS THAT THE PROSECUTION

SUBJECT: CROATIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY STATEMENT ON IRAQ 
 
 
1.  ON JANUARY 8, CROATIA\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED A 
STATEMENT CALLING FOR IRAQ TO \"PRESENT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT 
IT DOES NOT POSE A THREAT\" TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY.  THE 
STATEMENT (SEE BELOW FOR AN INFORMAL TRANSLATION) NOTES 
CROATIA\'S PARTICIPATION IN UNMOVIC, AND URGES THAT SHOULD AN 
INSPECTION REGIME FAIL IN IRAQ THAT THE ISSUE MUST BE 
REFERRED TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL.  THE STATEMENT LAUDS 
U.S. LEADERSHIP IN THE WAR AGAINST TERROR AND CALLS FOR A 
GREATER ROLE FOR NATO, BUT AT THE SAME TIME EXPRESSES CONCERN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

FOR REACTION IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO POTENTIAL ACTION IN IRAQ. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT OF INFORMAL TRANSLATION OF JANUARY 8 MFA 
STATEMENT: 
 
CROATIA HAS BEEN MONITORING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CRISIS IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST WITH CONCERN, AND IT APPEALS TO THE 
GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ TO CONSISTENTLY COOPERATE IN IMPLEMENTING 
U.N. RESOLUTION 1441 WHICH CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A PEACEFUL 
SOLUTION OF THE CRISIS. 
 
THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED THE ADOPTION OF 
U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1441 IN NOVEMBER 2002 
REGARDING THE INSPECTION REGIME IN IRAQ. 
 
IRAQ MUST PRESENT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT IT DOES NOT POSE A 
THREAT TO WORLD PEACE AND THAT ITS ACTIONS WILL NOT INCREASE 
THE DANGER OF WAR. 
 
WITHIN ITS CAPACITY, CROATIA IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE 
SUCCESSFUL WORK OF THE UNMOVIC INSPECTION TEAM IN IRAQ 
THROUGH THE PARTICIPATION OF ITS EXPERT INSPECTORS. 
 
SHOULD THE INSPECTION TEAM NOT SUCCEED, CROATIA BELIEVES THAT 
A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE SOUGHT THROUGH THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL.  ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF 
RESOLUTION 1441 GIVEN AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL SESSION IN 
WHICH IT WAS ADOPTED, THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD BE 
CONSULTED FIRST IN CASE OF ANY VIOLATION OF THE INSPECTION 
REGIME BY IRAQ. 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00072  102351Z 
IN THIS REGARD, CROATIA ONCE AGAIN CALLS ON IRAQ TO FULLY 
CO-OPERATE WITH UNMOVIC INSPECTORS AND IS AWAITING A UN 
REPORT EXPECTED LATE IN FEBRUARY.  CROATIA THUS SUPPORTS 
RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE ROLE OF THAT WORLD 
ORGANIZATION IN RESOLVING CRISIS SITUATIONS. 
 
CROATIA CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATES THE CONTROL, BAN AND 
ELIMINATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AND IS VERY 
ACTIVE IN THE UN AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORA IN TERMS OF 
CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF ALL CONVENTIONS RELATIVE TO THIS 
TYPE OF WEAPONRY. 
 
CROATIA ALSO WELCOMES THE EFFORTS MADE BY THE U.S. AS THE 
LEADING POWER IN THE INTERNATIONAL ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION, 
AND THOSE MADE BY NATO.  AS A CANDIDATE FOR MEMBERSHIP IN 
NATO, CROATIA HOLDS THAT THE ALLIANCE SHOULD BE UTILIZED EVEN 
MORE IN FIGHTING GLOBAL TERRORISM AND IN DEFENSE OF THE 
HIGHEST DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND 
SECURITY. 
 
NEVERTHELESS, CROATIA IS CONCERNED ABOUT ANY POSSIBLE 
REPERCUSSIONS OF A MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS IN THE 
ENTIRE REGION OF THE NEAR AND MIDDLE EAST.  IN THIS REGARD, 
EXPECTED REPERCUSSIONS OF A POSSIBLE ESCALATION OF THE CRISIS 
COULD ENTAIL A HUGE NUMBER OF CIVILIAN VICTIMS, A MASS 
REFUGEE CRISIS AND DISRUPTION OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

60 PERCENT.  KEY PRM-AND EU-FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE SET TO SHUT 
DOWN.  THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE OCCURRING EVEN AS THE NUMBER OF 
RETURNS IN 2002 DECREASED COMPARED TO 2001 LEVELS.  THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST USE ALL ITS LEVERAGE IN THE 
CLOSING WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH THE GOC TO PROMOTE 
RETURNS BEFORE THE IMPACT OF UNHCR\'S DOWNSIZING AND LOSS OF 
KEY PROGRAMS IS FELT.  THE BURDEN OF PROMOTING, FACILITATING 
AND FUNDING REFUGEE RETURNS IS INCREASINGLY FALLING ON THE 
SHOULDERS OF THE GOC, BUT ALL EXPERIENCE ARGUES THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT VIEW RETURNS WITH ANY SENSE OF COMMITMENT 
OR URGENCY -- PARTICULARLY AS GENERAL ELECTIONS APPROACH. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
UNHCR SAYS TIME IS NOT ON ITS SIDE 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  \"THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS EXACTLY ONE YEAR 
TO MAKE A BIG PUSH ON REFUGEE RETURNS.\"  THIS WAS HOW UNHCR\'S 
TALENTED CHIEF OF MISSION, OLUSEYI BAJULAIYE, SUMMED UP THE 
SITUATION FOR US RECENTLY.  THE UNHCR MISSION IN CROATIA IS 
PLANNING TO REDUCE ITS FIELD PRESENCE DRASTICALLY AND PHASE 
OUT MOST OF ITS RETURN-RELATED ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BY THE END 
OF 2003.  FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, IT WILL MAINTAIN A 
HEADQUARTERS IN ZAGREB AND THREE FIELD OFFICES IN OSIJEK, 
KNIN, AND SISAK, WITH A TOTAL OF ABOUT 80 STAFF.  UNHCR\'S 
STAFF WILL BE CUT BY 60 PERCENT BY THE END OF THE YEAR, WHICH 
WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR UNHCR TO MONITOR REFUGEE 
DEVELOPMENTS AND SUPPORT RETURNS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00094  01 OF 02  141716Z 
SENIOR UNHCR OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, NOTE THAT THE RETURN PROCESS 
IS FAR FROM OVER; THERE ARE CURRENTLY 228,000 CROATIAN SERB 
REFUGEES IN THE FRY AND ANOTHER 23,000 IN REPUBLIKA SRPSKA IN 
BOSNIA, OF WHOM UNHCR ESTIMATES THAT AT LEAST 30 PERCENT 
WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO CROATIA UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS. 
 
3.   (SBU) BAJULAIYE AND OTHER SENIOR UNHCR OFFICIALS 
RECENTLY CAUTIONED THAT BUDGETARY SHORTFALLS COULD FORCE THE 
MISSION TO IMPLEMENT PLANNED CUTS SOONER THAN INITIALLY 
EXPECTED.  FUNDING FOR ITS REQUESTED 7.8 MILLION USD BUDGET 
THIS YEAR HAS NOT BEEN SECURED.  OF THAT AMOUNT, 5.5 MILLION 
USD WOULD BE USED FOR PROGRAM ACTIVITIES INCLUDING RETURN AND 
REPATRIATION, REGISTERING REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED 
PERSONS IN BOSNIA AND THE FRY, PROVIDING LEGAL ASSISTANCE, 
AND HANDLING ASYLUM CASES.  APPEALS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT UNHCR CAN 
SATISFACTORILY CONCLUDE ITS MANDATE FOR CROATIA UNDER THE 
DAYTON PEACE ACCORDS. 
 
4.  (SBU) TO USE INCREASINGLY SCARCE RESOURCES MORE 
EFFICIENTLY, UNHCR HAS BEGUN TO COOPERATE MORE CLOSELY WITH 
THE OSCE ON KEY ISSUES RELATED TO REFUGEE RETURNS.  UNHCR AND 
OSCE MISSIONS ARE PRODUCING JOINT MONITORING REPORTS 
REGARDING THE GOC\'S PERFORMANCE IN IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION 
AND MEETING SELF-IMPOSED DEADLINES ON REFUGEE-RELATED ISSUES. 
 THIS GREATER COORDINATION, OFFICIALS AT BOTH ORGANIZATIONS 
HAVE TOLD US, WILL HELP THE ORGANIZATIONS MONITOR 
DEVELOPMENTS BETTER IN THE FIELD AND TO PRESSURE THE GOC TO 
TAKE ACTION ON PROPERTY ISSUES TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT 
CONDUCIVE TO PROMOTING RETURNS.  IN ADDITION, UNHCR HAS BEGUN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00094  01 OF 02  141716Z 
THE PROCESS OF IMPROVING THE CAPACITY BUILDING OF KEY NGOS TO 
ALLOW THEM GRADUALLY TO TAKE OVER SOME UNHCR 
RESPONSIBILITIES.  GREATER COORDINATION WITH UNHCR AND OSCE 
MISSIONS IN THE FRY AND BIH IS ALSO UNDERWAY. 
 
PRM AND EU FUNDING ALSO SET TO END 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) AS UNHCR IS PREPARING TO REDUCE ITS ROLE, PRM 
FUNDING, WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICAL IN SUPPORTING RETURNS 
THROUGHOUT CROATIA, WILL END IN JUNE.  PRM\'S BUDGET FOR 
CROATIA COVERING PROGRAMS FROM MAY 2002 TO JUNE 2003 IS 
SLIGHTLY OVER 3 MILLION USD.  ENDING THE PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY 
PRM\'S FOUR IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS -- AMERICAN REFUGEE 
COMMITTEE (ARC), CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES (CRS), 
INTERNATIONAL CATHOLIC MIGRATION COMMISSION (ICMC), AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE (IRC) -- WILL LEAVE A MAJOR 
GAP IN PROVIDING KEY SERVICES TO REFUGEES.  THE SERVICES 
INCLUDE GRANTING SMALL-SCALE HOUSING REPAIRS, FOOD AID 
PACKAGES, PROVIDING LEGAL ASSISTANCE, AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD 
ITEMS AIMED AT PROVIDING IMMEDIATE SUPPORT TO THOSE WHO 
RETURN. 
 
6.  (SBU) PRM PARTNERS, SUCH AS IRC AND ICMC, ARE ALSO 
INVOLVED IN FACILITATING CROSS-BORDER RETURNS FROM BIH AND 
THE FRY.  WITH THE CLOSURE OF PRM-FUNDED PROGRAMS IN JUNE, 
CROSS-BORDER RETURNS WILL BE DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED DURING THE

HEIGHT OF RETURN SEASON.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, MANY OF THE PRM 
IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS WILL HAVE TO CLOSE ONCE THE FUNDING 
RUNS OUT.  SOME PRM PARTNERS, HOWEVER, WILL CONTINUE TO 
RECEIVE FUNDING FROM OTHER SOURCES.  THE LOSS OF THEIR 
PRESENCE IN POTENTIAL RETURN COMMUNITIES WILL ONLY SERVE TO 
MAKE REFUGEES MORE RELUCTANT TO RETURN.  MANY REFUGEE 
COMMUNITIES HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND

ARE WILLING TO RETURN BECAUSE THEY HAVE RECEIVED DIRECT 
ASSISTANCE FROM THEM. 
 
7.  (SBU) ANOTHER KEY IC INITIATIVE THAT WILL BE WRAPPING UP 
BY THE END OF 2003 IS THE EU\'S HOUSING CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM, 
WHICH HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON RETURNS THUS FAR.  THE EU 
DESIGNATED 10 MILLION USD FOR THE PROGRAM LAST YEAR FOR THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF 1000 HOMES, ALMOST 400 OF WHICH WERE 
COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2002.  THE REMAINING 600 WILL LIKELY 
BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.  LOCAL EC OFFICIALS 
STRESS THAT THE PROGRAM, WHICH WILL AID IN THE EVENTUAL 
RETURN OF ABOUT 4,000 REFUGEES, WILL NOT BE EXTENDED BEYOND 
THIS YEAR.  THEREFORE, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOUSING 
CONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION WILL FALL SOLELY ON THE GOC, 
WHICH ESTIMATES THAT THE TOTAL COST WILL BE UP TO 800 MILLION 
USD.  GOC OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO STRESS THAT THIS IS A 
SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN FOR A COUNTRY WITH AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF 
ABOUT 10 BILLION USD. 
 
RETURNS LEVELING OFF 
-------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) THE REDUCTION OF INTERNATIONAL PERSONNEL AND 
FUNDING FOR REFUGEE-RELATED ISSUES IS COMING AT A TIME WHEN 
ACTUAL RETURNS ARE ALSO LEVELING OFF.  IN 2002, AROUND 11,000 
REFUGEES RETURNED TO CROATIA.  THIS IS COMPARED TO ABOUT 
12,000 RETURNS IN 2001, ACCORDING TO UNHCR FIGURES.  ONE OF 
THE MORE POSITIVE TRENDS NOTED LAST YEAR WAS THE RETURN OF 
YOUNGER REFUGEES, IN CONTRAST TO THE USUAL FLOW OF 
PENSIONERS.  UNHCR ESTIMATES THAT AT LEAST 20,000 REFUGEES 
WOULD RETURN THIS YEAR IF THE GOC MADE PROGRESS ON 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00094  02 OF 02  141709Z 
REPOSSESSION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF PROPERTY.  THIS FIGURE 
COULD INCREASE IF KEY ISSUES SUCH AS OCCUPANCY/TENANCY RIGHTS 
AND SOCIAL SECURITY ENTITLEMENTS WERE ADDRESSED. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.   (C) A REDUCTION IN UNHCR\'S ROLE IN CROATIA HAS BEEN 
ANTICIPATED FOR SOME WHILE.  IN JUNE 2002, AFTER HIS CUTOFF 
THREAT SHOCK TACTIC, HIGH COMMISSIONER RUUD LUBBERS DESCRIBED 
2003 AS THE FINAL YEAR OF UNHCR\'S DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
RETURN PROCESS IN CROATIA.  WHAT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY 
APPARENT IN RECENT MONTHS IS THAT MANY OF THE NGOS 
IMPLEMENTING UNHCR PROGRAMS WILL BE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE 
LACK OF FUNDING ONCE UNHCR COMPLETES ITS DRAW-DOWN.  THE 
ADDITIONAL BURDEN THAT SOME OF THESE NGOS WILL FEEL BECAUSE 
OF THE LOSS OF PRM-FUNDED CONTRACTS WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT 
FOR THEM TO SURVIVE IN CROATIA.  SOME ARE ALREADY PLANNING TO 
LEAVE, WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY AFFECT THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY\'S ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES TO RETURNING 
REFUGEES.  THEIR DEPARTURE WILL ALSO RAISE DOUBTS AMONG 
REFUGEES CURRENTLY IN THE FRY AND BIH OVER WHETHER THEY 
SHOULD RETURN. 
 
10.  (C) GOC LEADERS FREQUENTLY TELL US THEY WELCOME THE 
RETURN OF REFUGEES, BUT THEIR ACTIONS DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR 
RHETORIC.  THE DOWNSIZING OF UNHCR AND LOSS OF KEY 
REFUGEE-RELATED ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WILL PLACE AN INCREASED 
BURDEN ON THE GOC TO PROVIDE CARE FOR ALL OF ITS CITIZENS, 
PARTICULARLY THE MOST VULNERABLE.  JUDGING BY THE GOC\'S TRACK 
RECORD, WE SEE NO REASON FOR OPTIMISM.

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00094  02 OF 02  141709Z 
 
11.  (C) WE WILL INCREASE COORDINATION WITH OTHER 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ACCELERATE THE RETURN 
PROCESS WHILE THERE IS STILL TIME.  THE AMBASSADOR, ALONG 
WITH HIS COUNTERPARTS FROM THE UN, EU, OSCE AND UNHCR, ARE 
SEEKING A SECOND MEETING WITH PM RACAN TO GAIN HIS COMMITMENT 
TO RESOLVING REFUGEE ISSUES AND TO CLARIFY HOW THE GOC PLANS 
TO ADDRESS REFUGEE-RELATED ISSUES IN THE WAKE OF A DECLINING 
INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE.  WHILE WE WILL KEEP THE PRESSURE ON 
HERE, WE WILL NEED EU AND NATO OFFICIALS IN BRUSSELS AND 
OTHER CAPITALS TO STRNGTHEN OUR HAND BY SENDING A CLEAR 
MESSAGE TO THE GOC THAT EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP WILL REMAIN A 
DISTANT GOAL UNTIL SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IS MADE ON REFUGEE 
RETURNS.  THERE WILL BE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER SUCH A 
MESSAGE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS WHEN GOC OFFICIALS BEGIN 
TO VISIT EU CAPITALS TO PRESENT THEIR CASE FOR EU MEMBERSHIP. 
 GOC OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT CROATIA WILL SUBMIT IT 
APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP BY EARLY SPRING.

SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION 
------------------------ 
 
1.  (C) WITH ONE GREAT EXCEPTION, THE THIRD YEAR OF THE RACAN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00107  01 OF 05  151634Z 
GOVERNMENT RESEMBLED THE FIRST TWO:  CROATIA MADE MODEST 
PROGRESS ON SOME REFORM ISSUES, STUMBLING FORWARD WHILE 
SPENDING FAR TOO MUCH ENERGY AND TIME ON POLITICAL INFIGHTING 
IN A HIGHLY DYSFUNCTIONAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.  ON OTHER 
ISSUES IMPORTANT TO CROATIA\'S FUTURE, THE GOVERNMENT MADE NO 
PROGRESS AT ALL, SQUANDERING OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MAY NEVER BE 
RECAPTURED.  OF COURSE, THE YEAR\'S MOST SIGNIFICANT EVENT BY 
FAR WAS THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S MISHANDLING OF THE ICTY 
INDICTMENT AGAINST RETIRED GENERAL JANKO BOBETKO.  AS 
EVERYONE (INCLUDING WE) PREDICTED, THE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE 
RACAN GAINED BY FAILING TO DELIVER THE INDICTMENT IMMEDIATELY 
HAS ALREADY EVAPORATED.  THE DAMAGE DONE TO CROATIA\'S 
REPUTATION ABROAD WILL LAST MUCH LONGER. 
 
2.  (C) DIFFICULT AS IT IS TO BELIEVE, CROATIA\'S GOVERNMENT 
WILL BECOME EVEN MORE INEFFICIENT IN THE YEAR AHEAD AS 
POLITICAL PARTIES BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE COALITION SEEK TO 
MAKE THEMSELVES DISTINCT TO VOTERS.  THE RACAN GOVERNMENT 
WILL TRY TO GET CROATIA\'S BID FOR EU MEMBERSHIP BACK ON THE 
RAILS, BUT IT WILL BE CHALLENGED TO MAKE MUCH PROGRESS, SINCE 
EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS IN THE WAKE OF THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT 
ARE MORE SKEPTICAL.  BY LAW, THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT CAN 
DELAY ELECTIONS UNTIL EARLY 2004.  RACAN WOULD LIKE TO PUT 
OFF ELECTIONS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS ON 
CONCRETE ISSUES POPULAR WITH VOTERS.  A MORE REALISTIC 
EXPECTATION IS THAT RELATIONS WITHIN THE COALITION WILL 
DETERIORATE FURTHER AND AT SOME POINT WILL BECOME AN 
UNPALATABLE CHOICE EVEN FOR RACAN\'S SDP. 
 
3.  (C) ON THE ISSUES MOST IMPORTANT TO US, THE REPORT CARD 
FOR THE THIRD YEAR OF THE RACAN GOVERNMENT IS MIXED, WITH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

HIGH MARKS ON ISSUES LIKE ANTI-TERRORISM COOPERATION AND 
DEVELOPING PRODUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH THE FRY, PASSING GRADES 
ON SOME ECONOMIC AND A FEW DOMESTIC REFORM ISSUES, LOW MARKS 
ON COOPERATION WITH ICTY, AND FAILING GRADES ON JUDICIAL 
REFORM AND REFUGEE RETURN AND REINTEGRATION ISSUES.  END 
SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
WASTING TIME ON COALITION POLITICS 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) FULLY THREE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE ELECTIONS IN 
WHICH A CENTER-LEFT COALITION LED BY PM RACAN\'S SDP CAME TO 
GOVERNMENT.  IN JANUARY 2000, THE EXPECTATIONS OF CROATIAN 
VOTERS -- AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- WERE HIGH, 
PERHAPS UNREALISTICALLY SO.  THAT COALITION WAS BROUGHT 
TOGETHER (WITH OUR ACTIVE ENCOURAGEMENT) WITH A SINGLE 
PURPOSE: TO GET RID OF THE HDZ GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR 
CROATIA\'S ISOLATION.  ONCE THAT GOAL WAS ACCOMPLISHED, THERE 
WAS LITTLE CONSENSUS WITHIN THE COALITION ON HOW TO MOVE 
FORWARD.  AS TIME PROGRESSED, THIS LACK OF SHARED VISION, 
COUPLED WITH PM RACAN\'S INDECISIVE LEADERSHIP STYLE, HAS 
MEANT THAT EVERY TOUGH ISSUE, WHETHER ON ICTY COOPERATION, 
REFUGEE RETURN, ECONOMIC REFORM, SOCIAL POLICY OR MILITARY 
RESTRUCTURING, HAS DETERIORATED INTO A BICKERING BATTLE 
BETWEEN COALITION PARTNERS.  THIS YEAR, THAT PROCESS RESULTED 
IN ENDLESS THREATS OF RESIGNATIONS AND RUMORS OF SNAP 
ELECTIONS SO COMMON THEY WERE HARDLY NEWS ANYMORE. 
 
5.  (C) FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, RACAN\'S BIGGEST 
OBSTACLE TO GETTING ANYTHING DONE WAS HIS OPPOSITION FROM 
WITHIN THE COALITION BY DRAZEN BUDISA\'S CROATIAN SOCIAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00107  01 OF 05  151634Z 
LIBERAL PARTY (HSLS).  AFTER BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO 
APPEASE THE OBSTRUCTIONIST, IMPERIOUS BUDISA, RACAN FINALLY 
RESIGNED IN JULY, DISSOLVING THE GOVERNMENT IN A TACTICAL 
MANEUVER TO RECONSTITUTE THE COALITION A MONTH LATER WITHOUT 
THE HSLS.  BUT GETTING RID OF BUDISA DID NOT GET RID OF 
RACAN\'S PROBLEMS.  WITH THE NARROWEST OF MAJORITIES IN THE 
PARLIAMENT, THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW HOSTAGE TO THE SPECIAL 
INTERESTS OF EACH OF THE SMALL COALITION PARTIES.  FOR THE 
MOST PART, RACAN\'S SDP HAS MANAGED TO BULLY ITS WAY FORWARD, 
BUT NOT WITHOUT EXTREME, TIME CONSUMING EFFORT, AND ALMOST 
NEVER WITHOUT THE RESENTMENT OF SMALLER PARTNERS. 
 
CHANGING POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
---------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) THE CROATIAN PEASANTS\' PARTY (HSS) IS NOW RACAN\'S 
SECOND LARGEST COALITION PARTNER.  ALTHOUGH SMALL IN NUMBERS, 
IT IS BROADLY RECOGNIZED TO BE THE KINGMAKER ESSENTIAL FOR 
THE NEXT COALITION TO FORM A GOVERNMENT, WHETHER IT IS LED BY 
THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT.  THE HSS SEES ITSELF AS A TRADITIONAL 
RIGHT-OF-CENTER PARTY, BUT IT IS REALLY ALL ABOUT POPULIST 
CONSTITUENT SERVICE, ENSURING THAT WHILE IT IS IN GOVERNMENT, 
ITS ELECTORATE IS WELL TAKEN CARE OF.  IN CONCRETE TERMS, 
THAT HAS MEANT RISKING VIOLATING WTO COMMITMENTS WITH

POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN THE GOVERNMENT.  THE CENTER-LEFT 
CROATIAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (HNS) IS THE OTHER KEY PLAYER IN THE 
RACAN GOVERNMENT.  ALTHOUGH ITS REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT 
IS SMALL, ITS FORTUNES (AND POLLING NUMBERS) ARE ON THE RISE.

WILL RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE ECONOMIC STABILITY IT HAS 
BROUGHT ABOUT. 
 
7.  (C) THE BIGGEST CHANGE ON THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN THE 
PAST YEAR HAS BEEN THE ATTEMPTS OF THE OPPOSITION HDZ TO 
RE-PACKAGE ITSELF AS A \"REFORMED\" PARTY.  THE HDZ APPEARS TO 
BE SUCCEEDING IN CHANGING ITS IMAGE, EVEN IF IT REMAINS 
LARGELY UNREFORMED.  NOW, EVERY DECISION RACAN MAKES IS 
INFLUENCED BY HIS FEAR OF LOSING POLITICAL SUPPORT.  VOTERS 
WHO SUPPORTED HIS COALITION THREE YEARS AGO MAY NOW NO LONGER 
SEE THE HDZ AS AN UNPALATABLE CHOICE.  HDZ PRESIDENT SANADER 
HAS WORKED HARD TO CHANGE THE IMAGE OF HIS PARTY.  AFTER 
NARROWLY DEFEATING HARD-LINE TUDJMAN HATCHET MAN IVIC PASALIC 
IN A BRUISING BATTLE FOR THE TOP PARTY SPOT IN APRIL, HE USED 
ALL MEANS FAIR AND FOUL TO PURGE THE HDZ OF HIS RIVAL\'S 
SUPPORTERS.  WHILE SANADER\'S MOTIVATION MAY HAVE BEEN SIMPLE 
POLITICAL REVENGE, THE RESULT IS THAT SOME OF THE HDZ\'S MOST 
CORRUPT ELEMENTS ARE NOW ON THE OUTSIDE.  THERE ARE STILL 
PLENTY OF UNSAVORY CHARACTERS IN THE SENIOR RANKS OF HDZ. 
OSIJEK STRONGMAN AND WAR CRIMINAL BRANIMIR GLAVAS COMES 
IMMEDIATELY TO MIND.  BUT SANADER\'S HDZ RECENTLY HAS TAKEN 
REASONABLE POSITIONS ON A NUMBER OF KEY ISSUES, INCLUDING ON 
A NEW LAW ON MINORITY RIGHTS.  AS 2002 DREW TO A CLOSE, THE 
HDZ WAS THE HIGHEST-POLLING POLITICAL PARTY IN CROATIA. 
 
BOBETKO INDICTMENT AND CROATIA\'S GOOD NAME 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) RACAN\'S DECISION TO DELAY SERVING THE BOBETKO 
INDICTMENT WAS DRIVEN BY HIS BELIEF THAT, IF HE DID NOT GIVE 
THE PUBLIC THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS PUTTING UP A GOOD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00107  02 OF 05  151753Z 
FIGHT, HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD FALL AND RIGHT-WING NATIONALISTS 
WOULD RETURN TO POWER.  THE INITIAL PUBLIC REACTION TO THE 
INDICTMENT WAS EMOTIONAL.  IT SHOCKED MANY INTERNATIONAL 
OBSERVERS WHO THOUGHT THAT CROATIA HAD EVOLVED PAST SUCH 
VISCERAL NATIONALISM.  THERE WAS REAL CONCERN BOTH IN AND OUT 
OF GOVERNMENT THAT HARDLINERS WOULD FOMENT VIOLENT UNREST AND 
TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT.  YET EVEN AFTER THE WAVE OF EMOTIONAL 
NATIONALISM HAD CLEARLY PASSED, RACAN SEEMED INTOXICATED BY 
THE INITIAL POSITIVE REACTION TO WHAT THE PUBLIC PERCEIVED AS 
DEFIANCE OF ICTY\'S INDICTMENT \"IN DEFENSE OF THE DIGNITY OF 
THE HOMELAND WAR.\"  HE WAS DEAF TO WARNINGS FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT HIS RHETORIC AND DELAYS IN 
SERVING THE INDICTMENT WERE GRAVELY DAMAGING CROATIA\'S 
REPUTATION.  FOR WEEKS AFTER IT BECAME CLEAR THAT HIS 
GOVERNMENT WAS IN NO DANGER FROM THE RIGHT WING, RACAN 
DELAYED, HOPING TO SCORE MORE POINTS, PUTTING DOMESTIC 
POSTURING BEFORE INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS. 
 
9.  (C) RACAN\'S BUMP IN THE POLLS OVER BOBETKO IS LONG GONE. 
THE REVULSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, NOTABLY OF EU 
STATES, AT THE MANIFESTATION OF UNDILUTED NATIONALISM 
REMAINS.  AT LEAST TWO HAVE SLOWED RATIFYING THE EU\'S 
STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (SAA) WITH CROATIA. 
NO LONGER ARE CROATIA\'S SUPPORTERS IN THE EU WILLING TO GIVE 
RACAN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ON ISSUES LIKE REFUGEE RETURN 
AND PROPERTY RESTITUTION.  THE GOVERNMENT IS FACING TOUGH 
QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS SUPPOSED EFFORTS TO APPREHEND GENERAL 
ANTE GOTOVINA, THE 2001 ICTY INDICTEE STILL AT LARGE.  EVEN 
THE CROATIAN PRESS, POURING FUEL ON THE JINGOIST FIRE JUST 
WEEKS AGO, NOW CRITICIZES RACAN FOR FAILING TO SHOW 
LEADERSHIP DURING THE CRISIS.  RACAN\'S SDP HAS SLID BEHIND 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

THE HDZ IN THE POLLS AND SEEMS TO BE LOSING MORE GROUND EVERY 
WEEK. 
 
10.  (C) THE RACAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE LEARNED 
ANY LESSONS FROM THIS UNFINISHED AFFAIR.  IN THE ABSENCE OF 
CLEAR LEADERSHIP, CROATIA WILL FACE SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS EACH 
TIME AN INDICTMENT IS HANDED DOWN.  SINCE THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
DELIVERED THE INDICTMENT TO THE LOCAL COURT OF JURISDICTION, 
CROATIA CAN ONCE AGAIN FORMALLY BE CONSIDERED TO BE 
COOPERATING WITH THE TRIBUNAL, BUT IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT 
RACAN WOULD EVER FORCIBLY SEND AN INDICTEE TO THE HAGUE. 
WHILE CROATIAN WITNESSES CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE 
OFFICE OF THE TRIAL PROSECUTOR, THEY, TOGETHER WITH THE 
INDICTEES, ARE CONTROLLING THE PACE OF CROATIA\'S COOPERATION, 
RATHER THAN THE RACAN GOVERNMENT ITSELF. 
 
11.  (C) ONE OF THE LONGER-LASTING EFFECTS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S MISHANDLING OF THE BOBETKO IS THAT DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER GORAN GRANIC, WHO REMAINS RACAN\'S \"GO-TO\" MAN ON A 
BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES, HAS BECOME EMBITTERED AND RESENTFUL 
AND MAY BE LESS WILLING TO ENGAGE ON ISSUES IMPORTANT TO US.

STUMBLING FORWARD, MUDDLING THROUGH 
----------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) CROATIA HAS MADE PROGRESS ON SOME KEY REFORMS, BUT 
THE PROCESS NEARLY ALWAYS CREATES SO MUCH BAD FEELING THAT 
EVEN COMMITTED REFORMERS ARE LOSING MOTIVATION.  THE NEW 
MINORITIES LAW IS A GOOD EXAMPLE:  THE RESULT WAS WELCOMED BY 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS WELL AS BY CROATIA\'S 
MINORITIES AS A SOLID STEP FORWARD, BUT THE PROCESS OF 
GETTING IT PASSED WAS SO ACRIMONIOUS THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
MANAGED TO ALIENATE MOST LEADERS OF CROATIA\'S ETHNIC 
MINORITIES, AND EVEN MADE THE HDZ SEEM LIKE THE REASONABLE 
BROKERS WHO FINALLY PUT THE DEAL TOGETHER.  UNEMPLOYMENT IS 
STILL VERY HIGH (16 PERCENT) AND REMAINS ONE OF THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S BIGGEST POLITICAL LIABILITIES, BUT EVEN THAT 
INDICATOR IS SHOWING SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT.  BY FAILING TO 
ADEQUATELY INCLUDE UNIONS IN THE DRAFTING PROCESS OF A NEW 
LABOR LAW, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO LOSE 
THE ENDORSEMENT OF LABOR LEADERS IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS. 
 
13.  (C) CROATIA PASSED SWEEPING DEFENSE REFORMS AND A NEW 
NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE 
RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, INCLUDING A VITAL MILITARY DOWNSIZING 
PLAN, HAS BEEN SPOTTY AT BEST, MIRED BY A MIXTURE OF 
INSUFFICIENT POLITICAL WILL AND AN INSUFFICIENT BUDGET. 
WHILE THE RESOURCE CHALLENGES ARE REAL, OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
PROGRESS WERE LOST TO POLITICAL TURMOIL AND BICKERING ABOUT 
APPOINTMENTS TO SENIOR POSITIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, CROATIA WAS 
WELCOMED INTO NATO\'S MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLAN.  ITS EAGERNESS 
TO JOIN THE ALLIANCE WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO URGE THIS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00107  03 OF 05  151753Z 
GOVERNMENT AND ITS SUCCESSORS TO GET NECESSARY REFORMS ON 
TRACK. 
 
14.  (C) THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO TOUT ITS RECORD ON 
CREATING A CLIMATE OF MACROECONOMIC STABILITY.  THROUGHOUT 
THIS THIRD YEAR IN OFFICE, IT MANAGED TO KEEP INTEREST RATES 
LOW TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT, KEEP THE KUNA RATE STABLE, 
INCREASE FOREIGN CURRENCY HOLDINGS AND AGAIN (AFTER A 
TORTUOUS PROCESS) MANAGED TO COME TO AGREEMENT WITH THE IMF 
ON A STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT.  BUT THESE RESULTS ARE SLOW TO 
TRICKLE DOWN TO THE AVERAGE CROATIAN.  LACK OF PROGRESS ON 
PRIVATIZATION AND JUDICIAL REFORM HAVE KEPT LEVELS OF FOREIGN 
DIRECT INVESTMENT LOW.  GOVERNMENT DEBT IS REACHING WORRISOME 
LEVELS, AS THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SUBSIDIZE LOSS-MAKING 
INDUSTRIES.  HOWEVER, BY SLASHING TARIFFS AND KEEPING 
INTEREST RATES LOW, THERE HAS BEEN A BOOM IN CONSUMER DEMAND 
WHICH HAS PUMPED UP GROWTH AND IMPROVED SOME CROATIANS\' 
STANDARD OF LIVING. 
 
GETTING BETTER AT REGIONAL RELATIONS 
------------------------------------ 
 
15.  (C) THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS ASSERTED THAT 
IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH CROATIA\'S NEIGHBORS IN THE REGION IS 
A TOP FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITY, BUT RESULTS HAVE BEEN MIXED. 
2002 WAS A BETTER YEAR: SLOVENIA FINALLY LET RACAN OFF THE 
HOOK FOR HIS JULY 2001 GAFFE ON PIRAN BAY (INITIALING AN 
UNRATIFIABLE MARITIME BORDER AGREEMENT).  CROATIA MAINTAINED 
A GENERALLY POSITIVE STANCE TOWARDS BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, 
AND WHILE IT MADE NO REAL PROGRESS ON RETURNS ISSUES (SEE 
BELOW), IT RESOLVED A LONG-STANDING BORDER DISPUTE AT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00107  03 OF 05  151753Z 
KOSTAJNICA AND CONTINUED TO ENCOURAGE BOSNIAN CROATS TO 
STRENGTHEN THEIR OWN COUNTRY\'S CENTRAL INSTITUTIONS AND STOP 
LOOKING TO ZAGREB.  THE MOST PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WITH 
YUGOSLAVIA.  CROATIA AND YUGOSLAVIA FINALLY HAMMERED OUT A 
DURABLE \"TEMPORARY\" DEAL ON THE PREVLAKA PENINSULA, LEADING 
TO THE CLOSURE OF THE UN OBSERVER MISSION THERE.  CAPPING A 
YEAR OF STEADILY IMPROVING ECONOMIC RELATIONS, ECONOMY 
MINISTER JURCIC SIGNED A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH YUGOSLAVIA 
IN BELGRADE ON DECEMBER 23.  CROATIA HAS MADE ENCOURAGING 
NOISES ABOUT WORKING CLOSELY WITH MACEDONIA AND ALBANIA, THE 
TWO OTHER \"CONTINUING ASPIRANTS\" FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP. 
 
STRONG SUPPORT FOR ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
16.  (C) CROATIA\'S SUPPORT IN THE WAR ON TERROR HAS BEEN 
CONSISTENTLY STRONG.  IN ADDITION TO ITS CONTRIBUTION OF 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN APRIL, CROATIA MADE A SIGNIFICANT 
DONATION OF WEAPONS AND MUNITIONS TO THE AFGHAN NATIONAL 
ARMY, AND IN DECEMBER, THE PARLIAMENT APPROVED THE DEPLOYMENT 
OF A UNIT OF MILITARY POLICE TO AFGHANISTAN IN SUPPORT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE (ISAF).  WHILE THE 
BALKY CROATIAN BUREAUCRACY HAS SO FAR PREVENTED PROGRESS ON A 
MIO REGIME, CROATIA, WITH A LITTLE DIRECTION FROM US,

FAILING GRADES ON REFUGEE RETURN AND JUDICIAL REFORM 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
17.  (C) THE MOST DISAPPOINTING FAILURE OF THE RACAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THE DISPARITY BETWEEN RHETORIC AND 
REALITY ON REFUGEE RETURNS AND PROPERTY RESTITUTION ISSUES. 
THE NUMBERS OF ETHNIC SERBS RETURNING TO THEIR HOMES IN 
CROATIA IN 2002 REMAINED FLAT WHILE NUMBERS ELSEWHERE WERE 
PEAKING.  THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON ITS 
COMMITMENTS -- AND ITS OWN LAW -- ON EVICTING BOSNIAN CROATS 
FROM ILLEGALLY-OCCUPIED HOMES BELONGING TO SERBS.  WHILE 
BUDGET SHORTFALLS WERE GENUINE, THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE 
DONE MUCH MORE TO ENCOURAGE RETURNS.  DESPITE CONSISTENT 
URGING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE RACAN GOVERNMENT 
SIMPLY DID NOT MAKE THESE ISSUES A HIGH PRIORITY.  NOW, WITH 
AN ELECTION YEAR IN THE OFFING, IT IS EVEN LESS LIKELY THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT WILL FOCUS ON RETURNS.  BOTH WE AND OUR 
EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE IT INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT 
CROATIA MUST PERFORM ON THIS ISSUE IF IT HOPES TO PROGRESS 
TOWARDS EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP.  THIS IS A MESSAGE WE MUST 
CONTINUE TO HAMMER HOME AT NATO, AS WE BELIEVE THE EU WILL 
ALSO IN RESPONSE TO CROATIA\'S APPLICATION FOR CANDIDACY. 
 
18.  (C) CROATIA\'S JUDICIARY REMAINS THE SECTOR WHERE THE 
RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THE LEAST PROGRESS ON REFORMS.  THE 
LACK OF PROPERLY-FUNCTIONING CIVIL COURTS HAS BECOME AN 
OBSTACLE TO REFORMS IN OTHER AREAS LIKE PRIVATIZATION AND 
PROPERTY RESTITUTION.  BUT THE PROBLEMS IN CRIMINAL COURTS 
HAVE MORE COSTLY EFFECTS: POOR PROCEDURE, LACK OF 
ORGANIZATION, INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND -- MOST IMPORTANTLY 
-- UNPROFESSIONAL JURISTS SUBJECT TO POLITICAL INFLUENCE HAVE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00107  04 OF 05  151754Z 
MEANT THAT SOME SERIOUS CRIMES HAVE GONE UNPUNISHED.  THE 
LACK OF LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO JUDICIAL REFORMS HAS HAD 
AN IMPACT ON OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  USAID 
RECENTLY TERMINATED AN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WITH THE ZAGREB 
MUNICIPAL LAND REGISTRY, AFTER TWO YEARS OF MIXED RESULTS. 
THE REGISTRY\'S MULTIYEAR BACKLOG IS A MAJOR BARRIER TO BOTH 
FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENT, YET THE COURT RESISTED ALL 
EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT MEANINGFUL MANAGERIAL REFORMS. 
SIMILARLY, PROGRESS ON AN ONGOING JOINT WORLD BANK/USAID 
PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A NEW COURT AND CASE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN COMMERCIAL COURTS COUNTRY-WIDE HAS BEEN 
SLOWED TO A CRAWL DUE TO A MINISTRY OF JUSTICE THAT IS 
UNCOOPERATIVE AND RESISTANT TO REFORM. 
 
19.  (C) THERE IS SOME HOPE FOR CHANGE.  ALTHOUGH THE JUSTICE 
MINISTER CONTINUES TO DISAPPOINT, CROATIA PASSED A NEW 
CRIMINAL CODE AND INSTALLED A NEW, BUSINESSLIKE STATE 
ATTORNEY IN 2002.  WHILE THE LORA WAR CRIMES TRIAL WAS A 
SPECTACULAR FAILURE, THAT RULING COULD BE REVERSED ON APPEAL. 
 THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT MAY HAVE GIVEN NEW ENERGY AND URGENCY 
TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS TO PROSECUTE WAR CRIMES 
DOMESTICALLY. 
 
HOPES FOR EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP 
-------------------------------- 
 
20.  (C) EU MEMBERSHIP REMAINS CROATIA\'S TOP PRIORITY, AND IT 
HAS MADE SOME IMPORTANT PROGRESS TOWARD THAT GOAL IN THE PAST 
YEAR.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SUBMIT ITS FORMAL 
APPLICATION IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2003.  THE EU\'S RESPONSE 
WILL BE COLORED BY CROATIA\'S HANDLING OF THE BOBETKO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00107  04 OF 05  151754Z 
INDICTMENT.  THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A \"EUROPEAN 
OFFENSIVE\" IN WHICH THE PM WILL VISIT MOST EU CAPITALS IN THE 
COMING MONTH TO TRY TO GET CROATIA BACK IN THE GOOD BOOKS OF 
MEMBER STATES. 
 
21.  (C) NATO MEMBERSHIP REMAINS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT, BUT HAS LESS SALIENCE WITH THE PUBLIC AFTER 
PRAGUE; THE UNDERSTANDING THAT AN INVITATION IS YEARS AWAY 
HAS FILTERED DOWN.  WITH U.S. FORCES ENGAGED ELSEWHERE, WE 
HAVE LESS HIGH-PROFILE MILITARY ENGAGEMENT WITH CROATIA. 
 
LOOKING AHEAD 
------------- 
 
22.  (C) AS 2003 UNFOLDS AND ELECTIONS APPROACH, THE RACAN 
GOVERNMENT WILL TRY TO FOCUS ON A NARROWER SET OF GOALS WITH 
EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND APPEAL TO VOTERS.  ONE POLITICAL INSIDER 
TOLD US THAT THE HSS WOULD NEVER CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS WITH 
A PAPAL VISIT ON THE CALENDAR FOR JUNE.  SINCE THEY WOULD NOT 
RISK BEING BLAMED FOR DISRUPTING THE TOURIST SEASON EITHER, 
THE MOST LIKELY DATE FOR ELECTIONS WOULD BE OCTOBER 2003, 
BEFORE THE BUDGET HAS TO BE PASSED.  ELECTIONS MUST TAKE 
PLACE BEFORE APRIL 2004, WITHIN SIXTY DAYS AFTER THE END OF 
THE CURRENT SABOR\'S FOUR-YEAR TERM, WHICH BEGAN WHEN THE NEW

POLLSTERS TELL US THAT THIS NUMBER OF UNDECIDED VOTERS IS 
INCREASING IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO SDP\'S LOSSES IN THE POLLS. 
 ALL OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES LIKELY TO WIN SEATS IN THE NEXT 
PARLIAMENT HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL NOT JOIN A PRE-ELECTION 
COALITION, BUT ALL READILY RECOGNIZE THAT THE DAYS OF A 
SINGLE-PARTY GOVERNMENT ARE GONE.  THAT SHOULD HAVE THE 
SALUTATORY EFFECT OF FORCING THE HDZ TO MOVE TO THE CENTER, 
TO MAKE IT A PALATABLE CHOICE FOR POTENTIAL COALITION 
PARTNERS. 
 
24.  (C) OUR STRONGLY HELD VIEW REMAINS THAT THE HDZ HAS NOT 
YET EVOLVED ENOUGH TO MAKE IT A GOOD CHOICE FOR CROATIA\'S 
FUTURE AND WILL NOT SOON.  IF RACAN IS TO SUCCEED, HE NEEDS 
TO USE THE COMING YEAR TO CONVINCE VOTERS THAT A COALITION 
LED BY THE SDP WOULD BRING CROATIA CLOSER TO ITS GOALS THAN 
THE HDZ.  IT IS STILL IN OUR INTERESTS TO HELP HIM ACHIEVE 
THIS GOAL.  AS CROATIA HAS MATURED, SO HAS THE ROLE OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS.  RATHER 
THAN THE ACTIVIST, INTERVENTIONIST POLICY WE SUCCESSFULLY 
IMPLEMENTED TO GET RACAN\'S COALITION ELECTED, WE INTEND IN 
THIS ELECTION SEASON TO FOCUS ON HELPING COALITION PARTIES 
FOCUS THEIR MESSAGES AND GET OUT THE VOTE. 
 
25.  (C) WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT TO 
MOVE FORWARD WITH REFORMS ON ALL FRONTS.  WHILE ELECTION 
PRESSURES MAY MAKE THEM LESS RESPONSIVE TO US, OUR EU 
COLLEAGUES WILL LIKELY HAVE MORE LEVERAGE, SINCE MANY VOTERS 
WILL MAKE THEIR CHOICE BASED ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY THEY THINK 
CANDIDATES WILL MOVE CROATIA TOWARDS THE EU.  THIS IS A GOOD 
THING, SINCE MORE THAN EVER, WE AND THE EU ARE PUSHING 
CROATIA TO MAKE THE SAME CHOICES, AND THE EU IS PUSHING

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00107  05 OF 05  151754Z 
HARDER THAN IN THE PAST. 
 
26.  (C) PART OF THE REASON WE GIVE THE RACAN GOVERNMENT SUCH 
LOW MARKS IS BECAUSE THREE YEARS AGO WE HAD SUCH HIGH 
EXPECTATIONS.  AND YET THE COALITION GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO 
LIVE UP TO CROATIAN VOTERS\' AND OUR OWN HOPES, IT HAS MADE 
SOME IMPORTANT PROGRESS.  CROATIA HAS BROUGHT INCREASED 
STABILITY TO SOUTHEAST EUROPE.  BUT IF IT SHOWS NOTHING ELSE, 
THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT SHOWS HOW SHALLOW REFORMS ARE HERE. 
OUR CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT IS VITAL TO ENSURE THAT CHANGES 
BEGUN THREE YEARS AGO ARE INSTITUTIONALIZED.

CHARTER FOR NATO WITH ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA 
 
REF: 02 ZAGREB 2278 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) THE ATTITUDE OF OFFICIALS IN THE GOC TOWARD THE 
\"ADRIATIC CHARTER,\" AS PROMOTED BY BRUCE JACKSON, HAS BECOME 
SHARPLY MORE POSITIVE.  CROATIA IS NOW PREPARING TO 
PARTICIPATE IN A DRAFTING SESSION WITH ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA 
AND LOOKS TO SEND ITS FOREIGN MINISTER TO WASHINGTON FOR A 
SIGNING CEREMONY WITH SECRETARY POWELL IN EARLY APRIL. 
JACKSON REPORTEDLY TOLD FM PICULA ON JANUARY 15 THAT THE 
CHARTER HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE \"HIGHEST LEVELS\" OF THE 
USG.  CROATIA HOPES THAT COOPERATION OF THE \"ADRIATIC THREE\" 
WILL IMPROVE ITS CHANCES FOR AN EARLY INVITATION FOR FULL 
NATO MEMBERSHIP.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) ON JANUARY 17, WE MET WITH ZORAN MILANOVIC, HEAD OF 
THE MFA\'S DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND ALSO THE 
CHAIR OF THE GOC INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP ON IMPLEMENTATION 
OF NATO\'S MAP, TO GET A READ-OUT ON THE JANUARY 15 VISIT TO 
ZAGREB OF BRUCE JACKSON, PRESIDENT OF THE PROJECT ON 
TRANSITIONAL DEMOCRACIES.  JACKSON\'S VISIT WAS LOW-PROFILE; 
HE SOUGHT TO AVOID THE UNHELPFUL DEBATE IN THE CROATIAN PRESS 
THAT FOLLOWED HIS SEPTEMBER 2002 VISIT TO ZAGREB (REF). 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00127  01 OF 02  171618Z 
3.  (C) MILANOVIC SAID JACKSON ASSERTED TO FOREIGN MINISTER 
PICULA THAT THE IDEA OF THE ADRIATIC CHARTER HAS THE FULL 
SUPPORT OF THE \"HIGHEST LEVELS\" OF THE USG, PARTICULARLY OF 
THE NSC AND SPECIFICALLY OF NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER DR. 
RICE.  JACKSON DESCRIBED THE JANUARY 10 DINNER HOSTED BY THE 
ALBANIAN AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON, ATTENDED BY THE CROATIAN 
AND MACEDONIAN AMBASSADORS AND ALSO BY KEY SENIOR USG 
POLICYMAKERS, AS AN AFFIRMATION OF THE USG\'S SUPPORT FOR HIS 
EFFORT TO PUSH THE ADRIATIC CHARTER FORWARD.  WHILE MILANOVIC 
UNDERSTANDS THAT JACKSON IS NOT A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, HE IS 
CONVINCED THAT JACKSON IS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE USG IN THIS 
MATTER. 
 
4.  (C) MILANOVIC SAID THAT THE LEVEL OF RECEPTIVENESS TO THE 
IDEA OF GROUPING TOGETHER THE REMAINING \"CONTINUING 
ASPIRANTS\" INTO THE \"ADRIATIC THREE\" IS GAINING SUPPORT 
WITHIN THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT.  GOC OFFICIALS HAVE COME 
AROUND TO JACKSON\'S REASONING THAT IT IS EASIER TO GET THE 
ATTENTION OF WASHINGTON -- AND OTHER CAPITALS IN THE ALLIANCE 
-- WITH THREE FOREIGN MINISTERS ACTING TOGETHER RATHER THAN 
SEPARATELY.  CONVINCING THE CROATIAN PUBLIC WILL BE A MUCH 
MORE DIFFICULT TASK.  THE PUBLIC -- AND MANY OPINION LEADERS 
-- WILL CONTINUE TO RESIST ANY SORT OF REGIONAL GROUPING, 
ESPECIALLY IF IT SMACKS OF RE-CREATING THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA. 
 
5.  (C) MILANOVIC SAID THAT FOREIGN MINISTER PICULA AND 
JACKSON AGREED TO A COURSE OF EVENTS WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO THE 
SIGNING OF AN \"ADRIATIC CHARTER\" IN WASHINGTON IN APRIL.  THE 
FIRST EVENT IS A MEETING OF POLITICAL DIRECTORS IN SKOPJE ON 
JANUARY 23 (MILANOVIC WILL LEAD CROATIA\'S DELEGATION).  THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00127  01 OF 02  171618Z 
SKOPJE MEETING WAS ORIGINALLY BILLED AS A DRAFTING SESSION, 
BUT MILANOVIC CLAIMS IT IS TOO EARLY IN THE PROCESS TO DRAFT. 
 HE EXPECTS POLITICAL DIRECTORS TO AGREE ON BASIC ELEMENTS 
FROM WHICH A DRAFT CAN BE PUT TOGETHER LATER.  IN MARCH, ONCE 
A TEXT IS NEAR COMPLETION, THE \"A-THREE\" FOREIGN MINISTERS 
(MILANOVIC IS ALREADY USING THE MONIKER) WILL MEET IN 
DUBROVNIK TO AGREE ON A FINAL DRAFT. 
 
6.  (C) ONCE A DRAFT CHARTER IS AGREED UPON AMONG THE THREE, 
THE FOREIGN MINISTERS WILL TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON FOR A SIGNING 
CEREMONY.  MILANOVIC SAID JACKSON ASSURED HIM SECRETARY 
POWELL WILL SIGN THE CHARTER WITH THE THREE FOREIGN 
MINISTERS.  AFTER THE SIGNING CEREMONY, JACKSON TOLD PICULA 
THAT THERE WOULD BE A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH VICE PRESIDENT 
CHENEY. 
 
7.  (C) IN A SHARP SHIFT FROM VIEWS EXPRESSED JUST FOUR 
MONTHS EARLIER, MILANOVIC SAID CROATIA WOULD WELCOME THE 
PARTICIPATION OF OTHER STATES IN THE REGION, AND EVEN SAID 
THAT IF OTHER STATES, INCLUDING BOSNIA AND YUGOSLAVIA WANT TO 
JOIN THE ADRIATIC GROUP, \"SO MUCH THE BETTER.\"  MILANOVIC 
SAID CROATIA UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPORTANT THE ADRIATIC CHARTER 
COULD BE TO CROATIA\'S FUTURE.  MILANOVIC ALSO KNOWS HOW 
IMPORTANT CROATIA\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE CHARTER IS FOR

COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (C) CROATIA\'S NEW READINESS TO ACCEPT JACKSON\'S IDEA OF 
AN ADRIATIC CHARTER REFLECTS A SOBER, MATURING UNDERSTANDING 
OF WHERE ITS CANDIDACY FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP STANDS 
POST-PRAGUE.  CROATIA DIDN\'T LIKE THE ARGUMENTS JACKSON PUT 
FORWARD IN SEPTEMBER FAVORING A NEW GROUPING OF CANDIDATES, 
BUT THAT DIDN\'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE ARGUMENTS WERE 
CONVINCING.  NOW THE GOC -- AT LEAST AT SENIOR LEVELS -- HAS 
BEGUN TO COME AROUND.  BUT THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS SO FAR 
NOT EVEN BEGUN TO PRESENT THE IDEA OF A CHARTER TO THE 
PUBLIC, THERE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE RESISTANCE TO ALIGNING 
CROATIA WITH OTHER STATES OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, AND -- IN 
CONTRAST TO OTHER CANDIDATES -- JACKSON IS STILL NOT YET 
ENJOYING SUSTAINED ACCESS TO GOC LEADERS.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE ROSSIN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) YOUR VISIT TO ZAGREB WILL TAKE PLACE JUST DAYS AFTER 
CROATIA\'S FIRST ANP REVIEW AT NATO AND IN THE MIDST OF THE 
GOC\'S PROCESS OF RE-DEFINING ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH NATO\'S 
OTHER CONTINUING ASPIRANTS.  BUT NATO IS NOT MUCH IN THE NEWS 
IN ZAGREB THESE DAYS; FOCUS IS ON RELATIONS WITH ICTY, 
CROATIA\'S APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, A DOCTOR\'S STRIKE 
AND -- AS ALWAYS -- INTERNAL POLITICS.  YOUR VISIT SHOULD 
HELP TO REMIND THE PUBLIC HERE THAT NATO STILL CONSIDERS 
CROATIA A SERIOUS CANDIDATE BASED ON ITS OWN EFFORTS TO 
PREPARE FOR MEMBERSHIP.  IT WILL ALSO BE AN EXCELLENT 
OPPORTUNITY TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT 
CIVIL SOCIETY REFORMS, INCLUDING REFUGEE RETURN AND 
REINTEGRATION ARE TO THEIR CANDIDACY AND TO ENCOURAGE THE GOC 
TO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO DOWNSIZE AND RESTRUCTURE THE ARMED 
FORCES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NEW MOMENTUM FROM PRAGUE SUMMIT 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) BY THE TIME THE PRAGUE SUMMIT TOOK PLACE, THE PUBLIC 
HERE WAS WELL-USED TO THE FACT THAT CROATIA WOULD NOT RECEIVE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00159  01 OF 04  221842Z 
AN INVITATION.  WHILE THE GOC FAILED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
SUMMIT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REINFORCE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR 
NATO AT HOME, THEY DID USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN TO 
REDEFINE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER CONTINUING ASPIRANTS.  EVEN 
IF CRITICS CARPED, GOC OFFICIALS WHO ATTENDED THE SUMMIT 
NOTED THE DIFFERENCE IN HOW CROATIA WAS TREATED AT PRAGUE AS 
COMPARED TO THE WASHINGTON SUMMIT.  THEY TOOK THE \"TOUGH 
LOVE\" MESSAGE ON BOARD, YET WERE ENCOURAGED BY THEIR 
RECOGNITION AS A SERIOUS CANDIDATE WITH SERIOUS WORK TO DO. 
 
PRE-ELECTION POLITICS AN INCREASING DISTRACTION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3.  (C) THE COALITION LED BY PM RACAN\'S SDP JUST COMPLETED 
ITS THIRD YEAR IN GOVERNMENT (SEE REF A FOR BROADER OUTLINE). 
 ALTHOUGH, BY LAW, ELECTIONS COULD BE HELD AS LATE AS APRIL 
2004, MANY OBSERVERS PREDICT THEY WILL TAKE PLACE THIS 
AUTUMN.  PRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGNING IS ALREADY WELL UNDERWAY 
AND IS A SERIOUS DISTRACTION TO THOSE IN THE COALITION STILL 
COMMITTED TO MOVING REFORMS ALONG.  RACAN\'S SDP IS FACED WITH 
A RESURGENT HDZ WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE IS TRYING TO KEEP 
INCREASINGLY UNRULY SMALLER COALITION PARTNERS IN LINE.  ALL 
TOO OFTEN, THE RESULT IS POLICY PARALYSIS EVEN ON THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S NARROW ELECTION-YEAR AGENDA. 
 
THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT: THE GOC\'S SELF-INFLICTED WOUND 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4.  (C) THE GOC\'S MISHANDLING OF THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT 
CRYSTALLIZED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S FRUSTRATION WITH 
CROATIA\'S PROGRESS ON KEY REFORMS NEEDED FOR INTEGRATION IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00159  01 OF 04  221842Z 
EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS.  THIS CHANGE IN APPROACH TO 
CROATIA IS MOST DRAMATIC AMONG EU MEMBER STATES WHICH HAD 
BEEN WILLING TO GIVE THE GOC THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ON SOME 
OF THE SOCIAL ISSUES WHICH HAVE THEIR ORIGINS IN THE ETHNIC 
WAR OF THE PREVIOUS DECADE.  NO LONGER.  TWO EU MEMBER STATES 
HAVE DELAYED CONSIDERATION OF CROATIA\'S STABILIZATION AND 
ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (SAA) PENDING A SATISFACTORY OUTCOME OF 
THE BOBETKO CASE.  EU STATES ARE PRESSING THE GOC HARDER TO 
APPREHEND 2001 ICTY INDICTEE GENERAL ANTE GOTOVINA, WHO 
REMAINS AT LARGE. 
 
5.  (C) EVER SINCE THE GOVERNMENT FINALLY DELIVERED THE 
INDICTMENT AGAINST BOBETKO TO THE LOCAL COURT OF 
JURISDICTION, CROATIA HAS BEEN IN FORMAL COOPERATION WITH 
ICTY.  A COURT-APPOINTED MEDICAL TEAM DETERMINED THAT BOBETKO 
IS TOO ILL TO GO THROUGH THE STRESS OF THE INDICTMENT, LET 
ALONE TRAVEL TO THE HAGUE.  AN ICTY MEDICAL TEAM WAS IN 
ZAGREB ON JANUARY 15 TO REVIEW THE LOCAL MEDICAL FINDINGS AND 
TO EXAMINE BOBETKO.  THE RESULTS OF THAT EXAMINATION WILL 
SOON BE MADE PUBLIC.  THE WAVE OF EMOTIONAL NATIONALISM THAT 
FOLLOWED ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE INDICTMENT HAS RECEDED, AND WITH 
IT PM RACAN\'S REAL FEARS THAT HIS GOVERNMENT -- AND PUBLIC 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

ORDER -- WERE IN DANGER.  WHAT REMAINS IS THE MISTRUST OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE BITTERNESS OF SOME KEY GOC 
OFFICIALS (LIKE DEPUTY PM GORAN GRANIC) WHO MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN 
TO CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE WHAT THEY FEEL IS AN UNFAIR 
INDICTMENT OF THE GOALS OF CROATIA\'S \"HOMELAND WAR.\" 
 
EU MEMBERSHIP 
------------- 
 
6.  (C) WHILE CROATIA IS KEEN FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP, THE GOC\'S 
TOP FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITY IS THE EU.  RACAN HAS RECENTLY 
BEGUN A \"EUROPEAN OFFENSIVE\" AIMED AT GETTING CROATIA\'S 
RELATIONSHIP WITH KEY MEMBER STATES BACK ON TRACK AFTER 
BOBETKO.  THE GOC IS COMMITTED TO SUBMITTING FORMALLY ITS 
APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP IN THE SECOND HALF OF FEBRUARY. 
 ALTHOUGH WE UNDERSTAND INITIAL CONSIDERATION OF CROATIA\'S 
APPLICATION IS TECHNICAL IN NATURE, IF CONSIDERATION IS 
POSTPONED FOR POLITICAL REASONS, IT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE 
IMPACT ON THE ELECTORAL CHANCES OF PM RACAN\'S SDP. 
 
FAILURE ON REFUGEE RETURN 
------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) THE POLICY AREA IN WHICH THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S 
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MOST DISAPPOINTING IS REFUGEE RETURN AND 
RESETTLEMENT.  THE LEVEL OF GOC INACTION AND LACK OF 
COLLABORATION IS REACHING A POINT WHERE THE LOCAL 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS CONSIDERING PULLING OUT OF 
COLLABORATIVE MECHANISMS (THE JOINT LEGAL WORKING GROUP) TO 
PREVENT THE GOC FROM CLAIMING IN THEIR EU \"CHARM OFFENSIVE\" 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00159  02 OF 04  221842Z 
THAT IT IS ENGAGED WITH US ON REFUGEE RETURN ISSUES.  DESPITE 
CHANGES IN KEY LAWS AND A SERIES OF COMMITMENTS TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE NUMBER OF ETHNIC SERBS RETURNING 
TO THEIR HOMES IS FAR BELOW WHAT IT SHOULD BE.  LEGAL AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS REMAIN DESPITE GOC ASSERTIONS TO THE 
CONTRARY.  THE REASONS FOR THIS FAILURE VARY, AND WE DON\'T 
EXPECT YOU TO ENGAGE WITH YOUR GOC INTERLOCUTORS ON THE 
SUBSTANCE OF THIS COMPLEX ISSUE ON THIS VISIT.  YOUR MESSAGE 
SHOULD BE STRAGHTFORWARD: THE CONSENSUS OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY IS THAT CROATIA IS NOT TAKING THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY. 
 UNTIL CROATIA MAKES A REAL COMMITMENT AND PRODUCES 
SIGNIFICANT RESULTS, ITS CANDIDACY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN 
EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS WILL NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. 
 
STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE WAR ON TERROR 
------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) CROATIA RATES HIGH PRAISE FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO THE 
WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  FROM ITS IMMEDIATE STATEMENTS OF 
POLITICAL SUPPORT IN SOLIDARITY WITH US TO ITS CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF HUMANITARIAN AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN TO ITS 
DECISION TO DEPLOY A MILITARY POLICE UNIT TO ISAF, THE GOC 
HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN IN THE FRONT RANKS OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON 
TERROR.  YOUR EXPRESSIONS OF APPRECIATION WILL BE WELCOME IN 
YOUR MEETINGS WITH GOC OFFICIALS AND IN YOUR STATEMENTS TO 
THE MEDIA.  (NOTE: A SCHEDULE CHANGE HAS DELAYED THE FIRST 
GREEK AIRLIFT OF CROATIA\'S DONATION OF WEAPONS AND MUNITIONS 
TO THE ANA.  END NOTE.) 
 
IRAQ

                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00159  02 OF 04  221842Z 
 
9.  (C) ON IRAQ, OFFICIAL CROATIA SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING THE 
STANDARD EUROPEAN LINE.  THE GOC ISSUED A STATEMENT CALLING 
FOR IRAQ TO \"DEMONSTRATE THAT IT DOES NOT PRESENT A THREAT\" 
TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY (REF C), BUT ALSO EXPRESSING ANGST 
THAT ANY ACTION SHOULD BE SANCTIONED BY UN MECHANISMS.  THE 
MFA ESTABLISHED A TASK FORCE TO TRACK THE IRAQ ISSUE (WE ARE 
ENGAGING WITH THE TASK FORCE TO USE IT AS ANOTHER CONDUIT FOR 
USG VIEWS), BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS GENERALLY KEEPING A LOW 
PROFILE ON IRAQ.  FM PICULA, FRESH FROM A TRIP TO THE 
MID-EAST HAS IN SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AMBASSADOR 
EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECT THERE OF A POSSIBLE 
WAR IN IRAQ. 
 
CONVENTIONAL/DUAL-USE PROLIFERATION 
----------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) IN SEPTEMBER 2001, AT OUR URGING, CROATIA CANCELLED 
A CONTRACT FOR HIGH-SPEED PATROL BOATS TO IRAN; THE SHIPYARD 
WHICH WAS TO HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE CONTRACT WENT BANKRUPT 
AND AN ITALIAN FIRM APPARENTLY NOW HAS THE CONTRACT WITH

IRAN.  (THE GOC IS EITHER UNAWARE OF THIS OR HAS CHOSEN NOT 
TO POINT IT OUT TO US.  SOONER OR LATER, WORD THAT THIS 
HAPPENED WILL GET AROUND; HOW WE HANDLE IT WILL BE DECISIVE 
TO FUTURE GOC COOPERATION ON SUCH DEALS.)  NOW, THE GOC IS 
DEBATING WHETHER TO PROCEED -- OVER OUR OBJECTIONS -- WITH A 
CONTRACT TO REFIT A LIBYAN NAVY DIVER SUPPORT VESSEL.  WE 
KNOW OUR PRESSURE HAS HAD A BIG THOUGH NOT YET CLEARLY 
DECISIVE IMPACT.  WE LOOK TO YOUR VISIT TO HELP KEEP THE 
PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO REJECT THE CONTRACT AND OTHER CONTACTS 
WHICH COULD LEAD TO TRANSFERS OF LETHAL MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO 
STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. 
 
STALLED PROGRESS ON MOD RESTRUCTURING AND DOWNSIZING 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
11.  (C) DEFENSE REFORMS, BEGUN LATE LAST YEAR, ARE 
PROGRESSING SLOWLY.  REORGANIZATION OF THE MOD AND CROATIAN 
ARMED FORCES IS HAMPERED BY A DYSFUNCTIONAL PERSONNEL 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND A LACK OF FUNDING FOR THE MOD\'S 
AMBITIOUS AND COSTLY -- ALBEIT ESSENTIAL -- DOWNSIZING 
PROGRAM.  THE DEFENSE REFORM PROCESS HAS GAINED NEW MOMENTUM 
WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF A MORE DYNAMIC NEW DEFENSE MINISTER, 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ZELJKA ANTUNOVIC (SDP).  TWO OF THE 
CHALLENGES ANTUNOVIC MUST FACE ARE A SHRINKING DEFENSE 
BUDGET, 70 PERCENT OF WHICH IS DEVOTED TO PERSONNEL COSTS, 
AND A MILITARY ELITE THAT IS MISTRUSTFUL OF HER LEADERSHIP. 
 
12.  (C) ANTUNOVIC HAS OBTAINED POLITICAL APPROVAL FOR A 
FAR-REACHING RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, BUT IMPLEMENTATION HAS 
BEEN SLOWED BY POLITICAL BICKERING.  THE GOC HAS BEGUN TO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00159  03 OF 04  221843Z 
MOVE FORWARD ON DOWNSIZING THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES (CAF) 
AND THE MOD, A STEP ESSENTIAL FOR BUILDING A 
NATO-INTEROPERABLE FORCE.  A DETAILED, NATO-APPROVED, BUT 
VERY EXPENSIVE DOWNSIZING PLAN REMAINS ON THE SHELF AS THE 
GOC SEEKS EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDING TO HELP IMPLEMENT IT. 
ANTUNOVIC ANNOUNCED SHE WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH A 
SELF-FINANCED PILOT PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE 400 MOD EMPLOYEES, 
BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY, TO LEAVE THE RANKS.  BUT 
ESTIMATES SAY THAT TO \"RIGHT-SIZE\" THE CAF MUST LAY OFF OR 
OFFER EARLY RETIREMENT TO MORE THAN 10,000 PERSONNEL, NEARLY 
ALL OF WHOM ARE VETERANS OF CROATIA\'S HOMELAND WAR.  IN YOUR 
MEETING, ANTUNOVIC MAY ASK FOR INCREASED U.S. SUPPORT TO FUND 
DOWNSIZING.  OUR ONLY ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE IS A PUBLIC 
INFORMATION PROJECT AIMED AT BUILDING SUPPORT FOR THIS POLICY 
GOAL, BEYOND THIS MODEST PROJECT, THERE IS NO ROOM IN OUR 
ASSISTANCE BUDGET TO FUND DOWNSIZING.  ANTUNOVIC WILL ALSO 
MENTION CROATIA\'S CONTINUED SUPPORT TO THE COALITION AGAINST 
TERRORISM AND WILL SEEK TO EXPLORE AREAS WHERE U.S. 
ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED TO SECURE CROATIA\'S MARITIME BORDER AND 
COUNTER WMD PROLIFERATION. 
 
BILATERAL MILITARY COOPERATION 
------------------------------ 
 
13.  (C) U.S. MILITARY COOPERATION WITH CROATIA SURGED AFTER 
THE 2000 ELECTIONS, BUT THE NUMBER OF BILATERAL EXERCISES 
DROPPED IN THE FOLLOWING TWO YEARS AS OUR FORCES HAVE BEEN 
ENGAGED ELSEWHERE.  RESTRICTIONS TO OUR ENGAGEMENT IN CROATIA 
ARE CREEPING IN AT THE LEGAL LEVEL: UNWORKABLE RESTRICTIONS 
PREVENTING NUCLEAR POWERED VESSELS FROM ANCHORING IN CROATIAN 
TERRITORIAL WATERS, ISSUES PREVENTING SHIPS FROM IMPLEMENTING 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00159  03 OF 04  221843Z 
POST-USS COLE FORCE PROTECTION PROCEDURES (AND THEREBY 
PREVENTING USN SHIP VISITS), AND PUBLIC OBJECTIONS TO 
EXERCISES DURING THE CONSTANTLY-EXPANDING TOURIST SEASON NOW 
TOP THE LIST.  DASD RICARDEL\'S DELEGATION (SEE BELOW) WILL 
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN DEPTH DURING ITS VISIT, BUT RAISING 
THE ISSUE IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS WOULD FLAG IT FOR THE GOC\'S 
ATTENTION. 
 
CROATIA\'S BUSY POL-MIL SCHEDULE 
------------------------------- 
 
14.  (C) CROATIA\'S POLITICAL-MILITARY POLICY MAKERS HAVE A 
VERY FULL DANCE CARD FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.  IN ADDITION TO 
YOUR VISIT AND THE ANP REVIEW, CROATIA IS ACTIVELY DRAFTING 
AN \"ADRIATIC CHARTER\" WITH ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA (REF B).  AS 
YOU KNOW, BRUCE JACKSON WAS IN ZAGREB FOR MEETINGS, INCLUDING 
WITH FM PICULA.  DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MIRA 
RICARDEL WILL BE IN ZAGREB WITH A DELEGATION FROM FEBRUARY 3 
- 6 FOR THE BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS.  (THE KEY 
\"DELIVERABLE\" FOR THIS VISIT SHOULD BE THE SIGNING OF AN

OSD.)  AT THE SAME TIME, NATO\'S ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL

POINTS TO MAKE 
-------------- 
 
15.  (C) IN YOUR SHORT VISIT, YOU WILL HAVE THREE KEY 
SUBSTANTIVE MEETINGS, A PRESS EVENT AND A DINNER WITH A 
CROSS-SECTION OF CROATIAN LEADERS.  AT ALL OF YOUR MEETINGS, 
YOU SHOULD TOUCH ON THE ELEMENTS OF THE CHECKLIST BELOW, 
ESPECIALLY EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF CIVIL SOCIETY 
REFORMS NEEDED FOR PROGRESS TOWARD NATO MEMBERSHIP.  IN YOUR 
MEETING WITH FM PICULA, YOU MAY WISH TO ASK ABOUT PROGRESS ON 
THE ADRIATIC CHARTER AND HIT THE LIBYA ISSUE.  DEFMIN 
ANTUNOVIC HAS A KEY VOICE IN THE GOC DEBATE ON THE LIBYA SHIP 
REFIT. YOU SHOULD ASK HOW SHE INTENDS TO PRIORITIZE REFORMS 
ABSENT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS ALL ISSUES; DASD RICARDEL\'S

THE NEWLY FORMED INTER-AGENCY WORKING GROUP FOR NATO\'S MAP

CHECKLIST OF ISSUES TO RAISE WITH CROATIAN INTERLOCUTORS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
- NATO\'S OPEN DOOR. 
 
- URGE CLOSE COOPERATION WITH OTHER \"CONTINUING ASPIRANTS,\" 
BUT REITERATE THAT INVITATIONS WILL BE ISSUED ON INDIVIDUAL

SUBJECT: REFUGEE RETURNS:  RATCHETING UP IC PRESSURE ON 
CROATIA 
 
ON 9 OCTOBER 2002, WE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING AS A GROUP 
WITH YOU TO SHARE OUR CONCERNS ABOUT ISSUES RELATING TO SOME 
OF CROATIA\'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS WHERE WE BELIEVED 
FURTHER DECISIONS HAD TO BE TAKEN OR IMPLEMENTATION 
STRENGTHENED IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROGRESS TOWARDS 
EURO-ATLANTIC INTEGRATION. WE STRESSED OUR COMMITMENT TO A 
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT THAT WOULD USE OUR INSTITUTIONS\' 
RESOURCES TO ASSIST YOUR GOVERNMENT IN ENSURING THAT 
LEGISLATION AND IMPLEMENTATION WOULD FURTHER THAT IMPORTANT 
OBJECTIVE. WE APPRECIATED YOUR POSITIVE RESPONSE ON THAT 
OCCASION, PARTICULARLY YOUR STATED DESIRE TO MEET FOR 
THEMATIC DISCUSSIONS WITH US SOON AFTERWARDS. 
 
WE FOLLOWED UP BY A LETTER ON 14 NOVEMBER, PROPOSING A 
SUBSTANTIVE ACTION-ORIENTED MEETING ON A CORE ISSUE, REFUGEE 
RETURN AND REINTEGRATION. IN THE POSITIVE SPIRIT OF OUR 
OCTOBER DISCUSSION, WE SUGGESTED FRAMING THAT 
DISCUSSION IN THE CONTEXT OF A TOP-LEVEL PUSH TO REINVIGORATE 
THE JOINED LEGAL WORKING GROUP (JLWG). SUCH AN IMPETUS WAS 
NEEDED BECAUSE THE GROUP HAD SUFFERED FROM INADEQUATE 
HIGH-LEVEL ENDORSEMENT. SINCE WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY 
RESPONSE MORE THAN TWO MONTHS LATER, WE FEEL COMPELLED TO 
PRESENT SOME FURTHER THOUGHTS 
IN THE FORM OF THIS LETTER. EACH OF US HAS ATTRIBUTED GREAT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00167  04 OF 04  231842Z 
SIGNIFICANCE TO THE JLWG. USED PROPERLY, THE 
GROUP COULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING A COMMON VIEW, 
CATALYZING ACTIONS OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THE 
SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THEREBY MOVING 
CROATIA\'S EURO-ATLANTIC ASPIRATIONS FORWARD MORE QUICKLY. THE 
JLWG HAS BEEN CITED POSITIVELY FOR THE LAST 18 MONTHS IN 
VARIOUS ASSESSMENTS OF CROATIA\'S EFFORTS IN THE RETURN AND 
REINTEGRATION AREA. THAT IS ONLY MERITED, HOWEVER, IF THE 
GROUP IS GIVEN A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON RELEVANT 
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. 
 
YOUR GOVERNMENT GAVE A NEGATIVE SIGNAL IN THE MEANTIME, WHEN 
IT RECENTLY ADOPTED THREE DRAFT LAWS ON STATE COMPENSATION 
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING A PROPOSAL INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE 
ISSUE OF PARLIAMENT\'S 1996 RETROACTIVE 
SUSPENSION OF PENDING JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE 180 
OF THE LAW ON OBLIGATIONS, WITHOUT ENGAGING THE JLWG. THESE 
MATTERS HAD BEEN ON THE JLWG\'S AGENDA SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 
MID-2001, AND THEY WERE LISTED AS ISSUES OF CONCERN IN OUR 
LETTER OF 14 NOVEMBER. WE CANNOT ENDORSE YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S 
PROPOSAL, SINCE THE DRAFT LEGISLATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY 
REMEDY FOR PERSONS WITH SUSPENDED AND PENDING CLAIMS FOR 
DESTROYED PROPERTY. PRIOR DISCUSSION IN THE JLWG COULD HAVE 
ENSURED THAT THE DRAFT LAWS WOULD HAVE MET INTERNATIONAL 
STANDARDS. 
 
WE REGRET THE FAILURE OF THE CROATIAN SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OF THE POSSIBILITIES OFFERED BY THE JLWG. PENDING RENEWAL OF 
A CLEAR GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT TO THE JLWG ALONG THE LINES 
THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED, WE THEREFORE DO NOT FIND IT USEFUL TO 
CONVENE FURTHER MEETINGS OF THE GROUP. MEANWHILE, WE WILL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00167  04 OF 04  231842Z 
CONTINUE TO SEEK CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS TO SHARE OUR VIEWS WITH 
YOUR OFFICIALS. 
 
WE WILL REPORT TO OUR CAPITALS AND HEADQUARTERS OF OUR 
INABILITY TO BRING ABOUT A FRUITFUL DIALOGUE AND MEANINGFUL 
PROGRESS ON THE LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE IMPEDIMENTS TO 
RETURN AND REINTEGRATION. THIS WILL BE REFLECTED IN 
FORTHCOMING ASSESSMENTS OF CROATIA\'S PROGRESS WITHIN THE 
STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION PROCESS WITH THE EU AND THE 
MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLAN WITH NATO, AS WELL AS IN REPORTING BY 
THE OSCE, AND WILL SHAPE OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS ON RETURN AND 
REINTEGRATION IN CROATIA. 
 
CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP 
WILL BE CONDITIONED BY ITS ENACTMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF 
LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT FACILITATE RETURN AND REINTEGRATION 
AND MEET INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, AS WELL AS OTHER ISSUES 
ENCOMPASSED IN THE OSCE MANDATE. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SEIZE 
THE INITIATIVE IN ORDER TO MEET THOSE OBJECTIVES.  END TEXT.

2. USAID/CROATIA IS FUNDING ONE HIV/AIDS ACTIVITY WHICH 
FOCUSES ON PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH IN THE SEAPORT CITY 
OF SPLIT.  IMPLEMENTATION IS THROUGH THE AMERICAN 
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH ALLIANCE (AIHA) IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 
CITY OF SPLIT AND A LOCAL NGO.  THE HIV/AIDS PROJECT 
INCLUDES THREE INTERVENTION AREAS:  PEER-EDUCATION; 
DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY AWARENESS MATERIALS; AND A MASS 
MEDIA CAMPAIGN.  TWO ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES WITH NGOS WILL BE 
FUNDED IN MID-MARCH, BOTH OF WHICH WILL WORK ON COUNSELING, 
PUBLIC EDUCATION AND YOUTH AT RISK. 
 
3. USAID/CROATIA IS FUNDING TWO ANTI-TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES, 
ONE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CATHOLIC MIGRATION COMMISSION 
(ICMC) IN COOPERATION WITH THE ROSA CENTER (A LOCAL NGO), 
AND ONE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION 
(IOM).  BOTH ACTIVITIES FOCUS ON RAISING AWARENESS AMONG THE 
PUBLIC, THE MEDIA, THE LEGAL SECTOR AND POLICY MAKERS 
THROUGH TARGETED CAMPAIGNS AND TRAINING.  IOM\'S AWARENESS 
CAMPAIGN IS AIMED AT EDUCATING THE PUBLIC, THE MEDIA, NGO 
COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS - TO UNDERSTAND THAT 
TRAFFICKED PERSONS ARE VICTIMS AND TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN 
BEINGS CONSTITUTES A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. 
TRAINING FOR JOURNALISTS THROUGH THE IOM\'S PROJECT WILL 
ENSURE ACCURATE AND NON-BIASED REPORTING ON TIP ISSUES.  THE 
OVERALL GOAL OF THE ICMC--ROSA CENTER ACTIVITY IS TO BUILD 
CAPACITY OF LOCAL NGOS AND GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS THROUGH 
TRAININGS INCLUDING SUB-ACTIVITIES SUCH AS INFORMATION AND 
AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS.  IN ADDITION THIS ACTIVITY WILL PUBLISH 
A QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER.  RECENTLY, ICMC AND THE ROSA CENTER 
ORGANIZED A SEMINAR FOR CROATIAN JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS FOR 
THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING AWARENESS OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND

QUERY-CROATIAN CONTEXT 
 
REF: STATE 21881 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC OFFICER, ISABELLA DETWILER, 
REASONS 1.5 (D AND E) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) POST FEEDBACK ON REFTEL WTO BIOTECH MEDIA STRATEGY 
IS SHAPED BY OUR ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN THE ISSUE AND 
CROATIA\'S STATUS AS AN EU ASPIRANT WHICH PLANS TO SUBMIT AN 
APPLICATION FOR ACCESSION NEXT MONTH.  IN CROATIA, THERE IS 
LITTLE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF TRADE ISSUES, EVEN LESS OF 
INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL OR DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.  THUS OUR 
CAMPAIGN WOULD FOCUS ON ISSUES DEAR TO CROATIANS -- THE FOOD 
THEY EAT AND THEIR DESIRE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY ARE EATING. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
REACTIONS TO SUGGESTED MESSAGES 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) POST GENERALLY AGREES WITH THE THEMES OFFERED 
REFTEL. TO TAILOR THE MESSAGE, AFTER MAKING THE STRONG POINT 
THAT THE WTO DISPUTE IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER THE BIOTECH IS SAFE 
OR NOT -- THE EU CONCEDES IT IS -- BUT RATHER THE FAILURE OF 
THE EU TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED RULES, 
WE NEED TO ADDRESS VIGOROUSLY THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT 
BIOTECH FOODS ARE SUSPECT AND THAT THE US DOES NOT RESPECT 
CROATIANS\' RIGHT TO CHOOSE.  IF WE DO NOT OVERCOME THAT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00245  01 OF 02  311719Z 
PERCEPTION, WE COULD WIN THE TRADE BATTLE BUT LOSE THE 
MARKETING WAR. 
 
3.  (C) FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO REFTEL: 
 
-- THEMES A AND B (WTO COMMITMENTS, RULES-BASED APPROVAL 
PROCESS):  WE NEED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE EU HAS A PROCESS TO 
REVIEW APPLICATIONS FOR THE BIOTECH PRODUCTS, HAS DETERMINED 
THEY ARE SAFE, AND IS STALLING NONE THE LESS.  WHILE A 
DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE TRADE ISSUES MAY BE USEFUL FOR OUR 
GOVERNMENT INTERLOCUTOR, WE WILL NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE FOR 
THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC. 
 
-- THEME C (MISINFORMATION AGGRAVATING FAMINE IN AFRICA): TO 
DATE, THE CROATIAN PUBLIC HAS NOT BEEN SEIZED WITH THIS 
ISSUE.  ITS RECEPTIVITY TO THIS MESSAGE IS UNCERTAIN. 
 
- THEME D (BIOTECH SAFE, NO SCIENTIFIC BASE FOR MORATORIUM): 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THEME TO PURSUE IN CROATIA. 
UNFORTUNATELY, FOR EVERY SCIENTIFIC STUDY WE CAN OFFER UP, 
THE OPPONENTS OF BIOTECH ARE ABLE TO OFFER UP ANOTHER STUDY, 
WHICH WHILE OF MORE-THAN-DUBIOUS QUALITY, OFTEN REDUCE OUR 
IMPACT.  CITING SOURCES WHICH HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BIOTECH IS 
SAFE, SUCH AS THE EU ITSELF AND THE WHO, WOULD BE VALUABLE, 
AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED MORE NEUTRAL THAN THE USG. 
 
-- THEME E (BIOTECH WILL HELP DEVELOPING COUNTRIES): 
CROATIANS ARE NOT OVERLY CONCERNED WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH IN 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; WHAT THEY WORRY ABOUT IS ERODING A 
NICHE THEY HOPE TO EXPLOIT AS AN UNSPOILED, \"NATURAL\" 
MEDITERRANEAN PARADISE FOR EUROPEAN TOURISTS.  THEY ARE ALSO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00245  01 OF 02  311719Z 
WORRIED THAT IF THEY PLANT BIOTECH FOODS, THEY MAY ENDANGER 
THEIR EXPORT PROSPECTS TO THE EU. 
 
-- THEME F (BIOTECH ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL): CROATIANS 
ARE NOT INTELLECTUALLY CONSISTENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT.  THE 
MAJORITY OF CROATIANS REGARD CROATIA AS ENVIRONMENTALLY PURE 
AND ARE PERFECTLY WILLING TO THINK OF GMO-FREE FOODS AS 
\"HEALTHY FOODS,\" NO MATTER HOW MUCH PESTICIDE WAS USED TO 
GROW THEM.  NEVERTHELESS, IT IS A MESSAGE WORTH PUTTING OUT, 
HOPEFULLY APPEALING TO SOME MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE 
PEOPLE AT THE MARGINS AND POINTING UP THE FALLACY THAT 
GMO-FREE EQUALS \"ENVIRONMENTAL.\"  FIGURES SHOWING HOW MUCH 
PESTICIDE IS USED ON AN AMERICAN CORNFIELD VERSUS ITS 
EUROPEAN COUNTERPART COULD BE ILLUMINATING. 
 
-- THEME G (CONSUMER CHOICE): THIS COULD BE A POWERFUL 
ARGUMENT HERE.  BUT IT IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD, SINCE THE 
CROATIAN PUBLIC BELIEVES CONSUMER CHOICE MUST BE ENSURED BY 
LABELING.  A RECENT US SPEAKER TRIED TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT 
THAT LABELING OF BIOTECH FOODS WOULD REDUCE CONSUMER CHOICE. 
GROCERY MANUFACTURERS WOULD REFUSE TO USE BIOTECH SOURCES 
SINCE CONSUMERS WOULD INEVITABLY REJECT BIOTECH FOODS LABELED 
AS SUCH.  THIS ARGUMENT DID NOT FIND RESONANCE HERE.  EVEN 
OUR STAUNCHEST ALLIES -- THE REPUTABLE, SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC 
COMMUNITY, AGRONOMISTS, TRADE AND REGULATORY OFFICIALS -- 
THINK THAT MANDATORY LABELING IS AN INDISPENSABLE FIRST STEP

QUERY-CROATIAN CONTEXT 
 
TOWARD DISPELLING UNFOUNDED CONSUMER FEARS. 
 
4.  (C) WE MUST BE PREPARED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION \"GIVEN 
CROATIA\'S DESIRE TO EXPORT TO THE EU, WEAK REGULATORY 
STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONS, AND SMALL AREA, DOES THIS ACTION 
AGAINST THE EU MEAN THAT THE US WILL NOT ALLOW CROATIA THE 
TIME TO PUT INTO PLACE ALL THE STRUCTURES WE NEED TO CONTROL 
BIOTECH CROPS AND TO PROVIDE THE MONITORING OUR POPULACE 
DEMANDS OF OUR FOOD STOCKS?\" 
 
ALLIES IN A PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) OUR BEST ALLIES IN THE PRO-BIOTECH CAMPAIGN HAVE 
BEEN SCIENTISTS, MAINLY THOSE WHO THEMSELVES WORK IN THE AREA 
OF BIOTECHNOLOGY.  MUCH OF THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL 
INDUSTRIES SEE BIOTECH AS EITHER A DIRECT COMPETITIVE THREAT, 
OR A RISK FACTOR FOR FUTURE EXPORTS TO THE EU, SO HAVE NOT 
BEEN PUBLIC SUPPORTERS OF BIOTECH.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY HAVE 
BEEN COWED BY A VOCAL, LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL NGO FROM EVEN 
THINKING ABOUT SOURCING BIOTECH INPUTS.  WE DO NOT KNOW OF 
ANY JOURNALISTS WHO COULD BE CALLED \"ADVOCATES\" FOR BIOTECH, 
BUT A NUMBER ARE WILLING TO PRESENT BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY. 
 
SPECIFICS OF LOCAL REACTIONS TO A WTO-CASE 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) MANY CROATIANS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND 
PARLIAMENTARIANS, CLAIM THE US APPLIES A HARSHER STANDARD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00245  02 OF 02  311720Z 
AGAINST CROATIA THAN OTHER COUNTRIES.  THEY HAVE ACCUSED US 
OF THREATENING CROATIA WITH A WTO CASE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT 
CONSIDERED INTRODUCING A TEMPORARY BAN ON THE IMPORT OF GMOS 
(A DISTORTION OF THE TRUE STORY), WHILE ALLEGEDLY ALLOWING 
NEW ZEALAND AND THE EU TO LIMIT THE IMPORT OF THESE PRODUCTS. 
 ALSO, A DE FACTO BAN ON SOME PRODUCTS IS IN PLACE WHILE THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT GLACIALLY DEVELOPS LEGISLATION AND 
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING AND APPROVING BIOTECH PRODUCTS.  A 
WTO CASE WOULD SERVE NOTICE THAT WE WILL NOT ACCEPT 
INDEFINITE DELAYS.  HOWEVER, IT RISKS ALSO HARDENING ALREADY 
ENTRENCHED NEGATIVE FEELINGS ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THAT WE HOPE 
TO SELL. 
 
THE MESSAGE 
------------ 
 
7.  (C) IN CROATIA, THE MOST EFFECTIVE MESSAGE WOULD 
EMPHASIZE THAT THE EU ITSELF HAS FOUND THESE FOODS TO BE NO 
MORE RISKY THAN TRADITIONAL FOODS.  THE EU HAS HAD BIOTECH 
CROPS (SOY AND CORN) ON THE MARKET FOR YEARS WITH NO ILL 
EFFECTS, AND DESPITE THIS IT IS RAISING ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS. 
WE ARE NOT ASKING THAT THE EU DISPENSE WITH ITS APPROVAL 
PROCESS, BUT RATHER ASKING IT TO START USING IT.

SUBJECT:  LIBERAL PARTY ELECTS A NEW PRESIDENT 
 
1.  SUMMARY: YALE POROFESSOR IVO BANAC WAS ELECTED AS THE 
NEW PRESIDENT OF THE LIBERAL PARTY (LS) A JUNIOR MEMBER OF 
THE GOC COALITION, DEFEATING ZLATKO KRAMARIC BY A SLIM 
MARGIN.  ALTHOUGH FREQUENTLY A CRITIC OF THE CURRENT 
GOVERNMENT, BANAC SAID THE LIBERAL PARTY WOULD CONTINUE TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE RULING COALITION.  HIS AMBITION TO 
IMPROVE THE LS\'S STANDING INSIDE THE COALITION, HOWEVER, MAY 
BE THWARTED BY HIS DECISION TO PURSUE PARALLEL CAREERS ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC.  END SUMMARY.

PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00252  040821Z 
2.  YALE PROFESSOR IVO BANAC WAS ELECTED THE THIRD PRESIDENT 
OF THE LIBERAL PARTY (LS) AT A JANUARY 25 PARTY CONVENTION. 
IN A SECOND ROUND, BANAC NARROWLY DEFEATED HIS OPPONENT, 
INCUMBENT ZLATKO KRAMARIC, BY A MARGIN OF SIX VOTES. 
 
3.  IN THE WAKE OF THE JANUARY 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, 
THE LS ENTERED THE RULING COALITION AS A JUNIOR PARTNER 
HOLDING ONLY TWO SEATS IN PARLIAMENT.  THE NUMBER INCREASED 
WHEN TWO ETHNIC MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES JOINED THE PARTY 
CAUCUS.  OVERALL, HOWEVER, DURING KRAMARIC\'S TWO-YEAR TERM 
AS PRESIDENT, THE PARTY APPEARED TO HAVE LOST THE MODEST 
SUPPORT IT HAD UNDER ITS LATE FOUNDER AND FIRST PRESIDENT 
VLADO GOTOVAC. 
 
4.  ALTHOUGH A FREQUENT COMMENTATOR ON POLITICAL TRENDS IN 
CROATIA, BANAC IS RELATIVELY NEW IN HIS ROLE AS POLITICIAN. 
MUCH LIKE GOTOVAC, BANAC HAS BEEN VIEWED AS A MORAL VOICE 
RATHER THAN A LEADER.  HIS FREQUENT SHARP CRITICISM OF THE 
PAST HDZ GOVERNMENT -- AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE CURRENT 
RACAN GOVERNMENT -- HAS SOMETIMES EARNED HIM A REPUTATION AS 
A \"RADICAL.\"  IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND DURING THE LEADERSHIP 
STRUGGLE, KRAMARIC WAS ONLY THE LATEST TO HINT AT BANAC\'S 
RADICALISM.  AFTER HIS DEFEAT AT THE PARTY CONVENTION, 
KRAMARIC TOLD THE PARTY RANK AND FILE THAT \"RADICALISM IN 
THE PARTY WILL NOT PASS.\"  OVERALL, THE LEADERSHIP, 
INCLUDING THE LS VICE PRESIDENTS, IS MODERATE. 
 
5.  AT THE CONVENTION, BANAC PROMISED TO REBUILD THE PARTY 
THROUGH HARD WORK ON THE GROUND WITH ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF 
EVERY LOCAL CHAPTER.  HE PROPOSED THE LS AS THE \"THIRD 
OPTION\" AGAINST A BIPOLAR POLITICAL SPECTRUM WHERE THE HDZ 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00252  040821Z 
AND THE SDP DOMINATE.  HOWEVER, BANAC STRESSED THAT HIS 
PARTY WOULD STAY IN THE SDP-LED GOVERNMENT COALITION AS LONG 
AS THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE REFORMS. 
 
6.  COMMENT: BANAC RIGHTLY COUNTED ON HIS STATUS AS A 
POLITICAL NEWCOMER TO GET ELECTED TO THE HELM OF A PARTY 
EXPERIENCING A DECLINE IN SUPPORT.  THIS STATUS COULD ALSO 
BE HELPFUL FOR THE PARTY IN A NATION INCREASINGLY 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, AND STILL 
SUSPICIOUS OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE OLD HDZ GOVERNMENT. 
HOWEVER, BANAC\'S VOCAL AND AMBITIOUS PROMISES TO REBUILD THE 
LIBERAL PARTY AND STRENGTHEN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN CROATIA 
WERE SOMEWHAT DILUTED WITH HIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE BACK TO THE 
U.S. WHERE HIS PREOFESSORIAL DUTIES REQUIRE HIS PRESENCE FOR 
A FEW MORE MONTHS -- MONTHS THAT MIGHT BE CRITICAL FOR THE 
FRAGILE COALITION GOVERNING A COUNTRY APPROACHING ELECTIONS. 
HIS CAMPAIGNING ACTIVISM THAT WON HIM THE PARTY PRESIDENCY 
MAY NOT SERVE HIM WELL IN THE PRACTICALITIES OF POLITICAL 
LEADERSHIP.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) FROM FEBRUARY 3-5, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE MIRA RICARDEL LED A TEAM OF U.S. POLICY MAKERS FROM 
OSD, THE JOINT STAFF, MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD AND US 
EUROPEAN COMMAND IN BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS WITH 
CROATIA.  IN MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT MESIC, PRIME MINISTER 
RACAN, DEFENSE MINISTER ANTUNOVIC AND CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF 
LUCIC, RICARDEL URGED FURTHER PROGRESS ON DEFENSE REFORM AND 
PRESSED FOR RESOLUTION OF LEGAL ISSUES OBSTRUCTING CLOSER 
U.S.-CROATIAN MILITARY COOPERATION.  RICARDEL PRAISED 
CROATIA\'S COMMITMENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GLOBAL WAR ON 
TERRORISM AND URGED GOC LEADERS TO PRESS FORWARD ON 
PRIORITIES RAISED DURING THE RECENT REVIEW OF CROATIA\'S FIRST 
ANNUAL NATIONAL PROGRAM UNDER NATO\'S MAP PROGRAM.  ON 
FEBRUARY 4, DASD RICARDEL AND DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC SIGNED AN 
AGREEMENT TO HELP CROATIA DEVELOP ITS CAPABILITY TO COMBAT 
PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
 
2.  (C) PM RACAN EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. ASSISTANCE 
TO TIGHTEN CONTROL OVER CROATIA\'S BORDERS AND TO COMBAT WMD 
PROLIFERATION.  HE DESCRIBED THE KEY REFORMS HIS GOVERNMENT 
HAS IMPLEMENTED SINCE IT CAME TO POWER IN 2000, MOST OF WHICH 
HAVE COME AT A HIGH PRICE, BUT ALL OF WHICH MAKE CROATIA A 
LEADING CANDIDATE FOR INTEGRATION INTO EURO-ATLANTIC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00284  01 OF 05  060851Z 
INSTITUTIONS.  BOTH RACAN AND DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC ASSERTED THAT 
THE CABINET WILL PASS A MEASURE ON FEBRUARY 6 WHICH WILL 
ALLOW USN SHIPS VISITING CROATIAN PORTS TO IMPLEMENT 
NECESSARY FORCE PROTECTION PRACTICES, WHICH SHOULD CLEAR THE 
WAY FOR U.S. SHIP VISITS TO RESUME. 
 
3.  (C) CROATIA IS SERIOUS ABOUT ITS NATO ASPIRATIONS AND HAS 
BECOME A NET CONTRIBUTOR TO SECURITY IN THE REGION.  BUT 
CROATIA\'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP MUST FIRST IDENTIFY AS A 
NATIONAL PRIORITY AND THEN ALLOCATE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES 
TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES NEEDED IN THE DEFENSE 
MINISTRY AND THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES.  IT MUST ALSO BEGIN 
TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIETAL ISSUES 
ADDRESSED IN ITS RECENT NATO REVIEW.  END SUMMARY. 
 
4.  (C) FROM FEBRUARY 3-5 DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE MIRA RICARDEL VISITED ZAGREB FOR THE FIRST FORMAL 
BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS (BDC) WITH THE CROATIAN 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.  WITH DASD RICARDEL WERE GENERAL EUGENE 
ANDREOTTI, ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD 
(CROATIA\'S STATE PARTNER), REAR ADMIRAL RICHARD JASKOT OF US 
EUROPEAN COMMAND\'S J5, AND ALAN VAN EGMOND, DOD\'S DIRECTOR OF 
WESTERN EURASIA AND BALKANS AFFAIRS.  DASD RICARDEL MET 
SEPARATELY WITH PRESIDENT STIPE MESIC, PRIME MINISTER IVICA 
RACAN, DEFENSE MINISTER ZELJKA ANTUNOVIC AND WITH THE NEWLY 
APPOINTED CHIEF OF CROATIA\'S GENERAL STAFF, JOSIP LUCIC.

BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS 
=============================== 
 
5.  (C) THE FORMAL STRUCTURE OF THE BDC CONSISTED OF AN 
OPENING PLENARY SESSION FOLLOWED BY THREE WORKING GROUP 
MEETINGS TO FOCUS ON KEY ISSUES OF BILATERAL CONCERN.  IN HER 
OPENING STATEMENT, DASD RICARDEL RECOGNIZED CROATIA\'S 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM, HIGHLIGHTING THE 
INTERDICTION OF THE M/V BOKA STAR, THE CONTRIBUTION OF 
WEAPONS AND MUNITIONS TO THE AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY AND THE 
IMMINENT DEPLOYMENT OF A MILITARY POLICE PLATOON TO 
AFGHANISTAN IN SUPPORT OF ISAF.  EUCOM\'S RADM JASKOT GAVE A 
BRIEFING ON THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM, HIGHLIGHTING THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY PARTNERS.  DASD RICARDEL FOLLOWED WITH 
A HARD-HITTING PRESENTATION ON THE CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGERS 
PRESENTED BY THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION, PARTICULARLY THE NEXUS BETWEEN TERRORIST GROUPS, 
STATES WHICH SPONSOR TERRORISM AND WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION. 
 
6.  (C) CROATIAN PRESENTATIONS TO THE PLENARY SESSION COVERED 
CROATIA\'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM AND TO OTHER 
PEACE SUPPORT OPERATIONS.  DASD RICARDEL WELCOMED CROATIA\'S 
EAGERNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SO MANY OPERATIONS, BUT 
QUESTIONED IF CROATIA HAS A FISCAL PLAN OR HAS IDENTIFIED 
SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO CONDUCT SUCH OPERATIONS.  ASSISTANT

DEFMIN JELENA GRCIC POLIC, NOTING AN INTERAGENCY PAPER IN 
PROGRESS, RESPONDED THAT THE ISAF DEPLOYMENT WILL BE THE 
FIRST INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY WHICH THE MOD\'S BUDGET WILL NOT 
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ABSORBING; THE CABINET TOOK A DECISION TO 
FINANCE THIS ACTIVITY WITH A SEPARATE LINE ITEM.  THE MOD 
HOPES TO REPLICATE THIS PRACTICE FOR OTHER PEACE SUPPORT 
OPERATIONS AND FOR FUNDING DEFENSE REFORMS LIKE DOWNSIZING, 
WHICH ARE FAR BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE MOD\'S BUDGET. 
 
WORKING GROUPS PRODUCE CONCRETE RESULTS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) THE THREE WORKING GROUPS DISCUSSED THE BROAD RANGE OF 
ISSUES RELATING TO U.S. - CROATIA BILATERAL DEFENSE 
RELATIONS.  FOLLOWING SUBSTANTIVE PRESENTATIONS OF CROATIA\'S 
REFORM PLANS, U.S. PARTICIPANTS PROPOSED SEVERAL CONCRETE 
AREAS WHERE USG EXPERIENCE AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO HELP ACHIEVE MOD GOALS.  WORKING GROUPS REVIEWED 
CROATIA\'S PROGRESS IN NATO\'S MAP PROGRAM, DISCUSSED THE USE 
OF U.S. ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT CROATIA\'S DEFENSE REFORM, 
MODERNIZATION AND TRAINING GOALS, AND BORDER SECURITY AND 
COUNTER-PROLIFERATION.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WORKING 
GROUPS AGREED: 
 
- TO FORM AN INFORMAL BILATERAL LEGAL WORKING GROUP BETWEEN 
EUCOM AND CROATIAN MOD EXPERTS (AUGMENTED AS NECESSARY) TO 
MOVE QUICKLY TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING IMPEDIMENTS TO MILITARY 
COOPERATION, AND 
 
- THAT THE GOC WOULD FORM A JOINT CIVILIAN-MILITARY 
INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP TO ADDRESS EXPORT CONTROL AND

BORDER SECURITY ISSUES.  THIS GROUP WILL SERVE AS THE GOC\'S

COORDINATE AND DIRECT ASSISTANCE EFFORTS. 
 
8.  (U)  THE BDC CONCLUDED BY DECIDING TO MEET AGAIN IN A 
YEAR\'S TIME WITH THE U.S. HOSTING.

BILATERAL MEETINGS 
================== 
 
PM RACAN: PROGRESS TOWARD NATO AND EU MEMBERSHIP 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
9.  (C) IN A MEETING WITH DASD RICARDEL AND THE AMBASSADOR, 
PM RACAN DESCRIBED IN DETAIL HOW CROATIA\'S PROGRESS ON 
REFORMS  MAKES IT A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR INTEGRATION INTO 
EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS.  DESPITE THE INTRA-COALITION 
BRINKSMANSHIP THAT SO OFTEN CROWDS THE HEADLINES, RACAN SAID 
HIS GOVERNMENT IS STABLE AND WILL SERVE OUT ITS FULL TERM. 
COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC REFORM HAS PRODUCED DURABLE RESULTS, 
THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION IS STABLE, GDP GROWTH IS EXPECTED 
TO REACH 5 PERCENT THIS YEAR, AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN 
DECREASING FOR THE PAST TEN MONTHS.  RACAN STATED THAT HIS 
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT SLACK OFF THE PACE OF REFORMS IN ITS LAST 
YEAR, AND PLEDGED HIS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD 
WITH REFORMS IN THE MILITARY. 
 
10.  (C) ACCORDING TO RACAN, CROATIA IS SUCCESSFULLY 
ADDRESSING THE POLITICAL CONDITIONS OF NATO AND THE EU.  HE 
CLAIMED CROATIA SHOULD HAVE \"SOLVED\" THE PROBLEM OF MINORITY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00284  02 OF 05  060851Z 
RIGHTS WITH PASSAGE OF A PROGRESSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON 
NATIONAL MINORITIES, BUT ADMITTED THAT IMPLEMENTATION IS 
INCOMPLETE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.  RACAN DEFENDED GOC ACTION ON 
REFUGEE RETURN; CROATIA\'S POST-WAR \"ETHNIC MOSAIC\" WILL NEVER 
BE THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE 1991, BUT THE GOC IS COMMITTED 
TO SUPPORTING THE RETURN OF ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO COME BACK. 
FULLY 100,000 HAVE ALREADY RETURNED SINCE 2000, HE EXPECTS 
ANOTHER 20,000 WILL SEEK TO RETURN IN 2003.  THE GOC HAS 
COMMITTED 300 MILLION EUROS IN ITS 2003 BUDGET TO 
RECONSTRUCTION AND RETURN; ALL THOSE WHO FORMALLY EXPRESSED A 
DESIRE TO RETURN TO CROATIA BY THE END OF 2002 WILL BE 
ACCOMMODATED BY THE END OF 2003, RACAN CLAIMED. 
 
11.  (C) RACAN TOUTED CROATIA\'S STRONG RECORD OF REGIONAL 
COOPERATION AND SAID THE GOC WAS STRONGLY INCLINED TO LIFT 
ITS VISA REQUIREMENT FOR CITIZENS OF YUGOSLAVIA, THOUGH THIS 
WAS POLITICALLY QUITE SENSITIVE.  HE REMARKED THAT SUCH 
CROATIAN LIBERALIZATION WOULD, IRONICALLY, COME JUST AS 
HUNGARY IMPOSES A VISA REQUIREMENT ON THE FRY. 
 
12.  (C) ON CROATIA\'S RELATIONS WITH ICTY, RACAN ASSERTED 
THAT CROATIA IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
COMMITMENT TO CLOSE COOPERATION HAS BEEN VALIDATED BY ITS 
APPROACH TO THE BOBETKO CASE.  FIRST, THE VERY PUBLIC 
DISCUSSION OF HOW LACK OF COOPERATION WITH ICTY WOULD AFFECT 
CROATIA\'S CHANCES TO ENTER THE EU AND NATO HAVE SHORED UP

THAT WITH THE BOBETKO CASE SOON TO REACH FINAL RESOLUTION, 
\"NOW GOTOVINA HAS BECOME TOPICAL,\" BUT HE STRESSED THAT 
\"CROATIA WILL NOT BE HELD HOSTAGE BY GENERAL GOTOVINA.\" 
 
13.  (C) AS IN ALL HER BILATERAL MEETINGS, DASD RICARDEL 
THANKED CROATIA FOR ITS SUPPORT TO AND CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE 
GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.  WITH RACAN, SHE ALSO LAID DOWN A 
MARKER FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE REQUESTS FOR LANDING RIGHTS AND 
TRANSIT OF U.S. PERSONNEL EN ROUTE TO THE MIDDLE EAST REGION 
FOR MOVEMENT OF FORCES RELATED TO IRAQ; WHILE HE MADE NO 
COMMITMENTS, HE EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT SUCH REQUESTS WOULD 
BE FAVORABLY REVIEWED.  DASD RICARDEL TOLD RACAN THAT SHE HAD 
GIVEN THE BDC PLENARY SESSION A BLUNT BRIEFING ON THE THREATS 
OF PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION; THE USG 
APPRECIATES PAST GOC SUPPORT IN REFRAINING FROM SALES OF 
WEAPONS OR DUAL-USE ITEMS TO STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM AND 
URGED CONTINUED ADHERENCE TO THIS POLICY OF NOT SELLING 
WEAPONS TO LIBYA AND SIMILAR STATES. 
 
14.  (C) RICARDEL PRESSED RACAN TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DEFENSE 
REFORMS AND EXPRESSED UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFICULT ROAD 
AHEAD; THE U.S. WOULD CONTINUE TO ASSIST WHERE IT CAN. 
RICARDEL SAID THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CROATIA\'S 
RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS AS IT MAKES ITS BID FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00284  03 OF 05  060852Z 
AND URGED RACAN TO SUPPORT THE REFORMS IDENTIFIED IN THE MAP 
ANP REVIEW PROCESS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO CIVIL 
SOCIETY ISSUES LIKE REFUGEE RETURN. 
 
15.  (C) DASD RICARDEL TOUCHED ON THE ISSUE OF THE USG\'S 
OUTSTANDING REQUEST TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH 
CROATIA.  SHE EXPLAINED U.S. LEGISLATION MAKING PROVISION OF 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO ALL NON-NATO STATES CONTINGENT ON 
SIGNING SUCH AN AGREEMENT BY JULY 1, 2003; USG MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE IS ESSENTIAL FOR CROATIA TO ACHIEVE ITS 
MODERNIZATION AND INTEROPERABILITY GOALS.  RACAN EXPLAINED 
THAT CROATIA IS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE EU\'S INSISTENCE THAT 
CANDIDATES TOE THE EU LINE AND THE USG\'S INSISTENCE ON AN CIC 
EXEMPTION.  HE CONTINUES TO WAIT FOR A CLEAR SIGNAL FROM 
BRUSSELS BEFORE MOVING FORWARD.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD RACAN 
THAT USG-EU DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE, BUT THE EU HAS ALREADY 
STATED IT DOES NOT OBJECT TO ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS, BUT HAS 
SIMPLY SET A LIST OF CRITERIA WHICH SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. 
STRESSING THE APPROACHING DEADLINE UNDER U.S. LEGISLATION, 
THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT TO RACAN THAT THE GOC EVENTUALLY 
MAY HAVE TO DECIDE BASED ON CROATIA\'S GOALS AND NEEDS, NOT 
THOSE OF THE EU. 
 
PRESIDENT MESIC: CROATIA WILL CONTINUE DIFFICULT REFORMS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
16.  (C) DASD RICARDEL THANKED PRESIDENT MESIC FOR HIS MORAL 
LEADERSHIP ON REFORM ISSUES AND FOR HIS INSISTENCE THAT 
CROATIA MUST CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE HAGUE.  SHE URGED 
THAT HE LEND HIS LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT OF THE ISSUE OF 
DEFENSE DOWNSIZING AND RESTRUCTURING.  LIKE RACAN, MESIC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00284  03 OF 05  060852Z 
OUTLINED THE STRONG ECONOMIC PROGRESS THE GOC CONTINUES TO 
MAKE, BUT EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AT THE GOVERNMENT\'S INABILITY 
TO GET ITS MESSAGE OUT TO THE PUBLIC.  HE PLEDGED CROATIA\'S 
COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WITH NECESSARY REFORMS, BUT EXPLAINED 
THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT IN WHICH THE MOD 
MUST CARRY OUT DOWNSIZING EFFORTS.  MESIC HAILED THE USG 
COMMITMENT TO ASSIST CROATIA TO COMBAT THE PROLIFERATION OF 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  DASD RICARDEL REQUESTED 
CROATIA\'S CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR IRAQI COMPLIANCE WITH UN 
RESOLUTIONS NOTING THAT CROATIA EXPERIENCED FIRST-HAND THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF STATES\' NON-COMPLIANCE WITH UN RESOLUTIONS. 
 
CHOD LUCIC:  U.S. COOPERATION ALREADY BEARS RESULTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
17.  (C) DASD RICARDEL CONGRATULATED CHIEF OF CROATIA\'S 
GENERAL STAFF JOSIP LUCIC ON HIS RECENT APPOINTMENT AND 
EMPHASIZED THE USG DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH STRONG BILATERAL 
MILITARY COOPERATION.  LUCIC STRONGLY SUPPORTED U.S. 
ENGAGEMENT, AND PARTICULARLY HAILED IMET TRAINING PROGRAMS AS 
AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE OF U.S. INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF 
CROATIA\'S ARMED FORCES.  A RECENT AND ENTHUSIASTIC GRADUATE 
OF AN IMET ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRAINING PROGRAM, LUCIC ASSERTED 
THAT A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CROATIA\'S OFFICERS HAVE BENEFITED 
FROM THE PROGRAMS.  RICARDEL PRESSED LUCIC TO ENSURE THAT 
CROATIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL TRAINED BY U.S. PROGRAMS ARE

RELATIONSHIP.  SHE EXPRESSED REGRET AT NOT BEING ABLE TO BE 
MORE INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THE WORK OF THE BDC, BUT

ABOARD USN SHIPS IN CROATIAN PORTS.  DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC 
ASSERTED THAT THE CABINET WILL PASS A MEASURE ON FEBRUARY 6

20.  (C) DASD RICARDEL THANKED DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC FOR HER 
POLICY LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORTING THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM. 
ANTUNOVIC ASSERTED THAT THE WAR ON TERROR IS BOTH A CHALLENGE 
AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CROATIA TO SHOW WHAT IT STANDS FOR.

ANTUNOVIC SIGNED AN AGREEMENT GOVERNING MODALITIES OF 
PROVISION OF USG ASSISTANCE TO HELP CROATIA DEVELOP ITS 
CAPABILITY TO COMBAT PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION.  ANTUNOVIC NOTED THAT CROATIA WAS GAINING 
EXPERTISE AND EQUIPMENT AND THE U.S. WAS GAINING A PARTNER.

HELPED: IT OCCURRED SHORTLY BEFORE CROATIA\'S NIGHTLY NEWS 
BROADCASTS, FACILITATING EXTENSIVE PLAY ON TV AND RADIO 
NEWS.  MUCH FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE VILNIUS GROUP\'S STATEMENT 
OF SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POSITION ISSUED AFTER POWELL\'S 
PRESENTATION (REFTEL).  WHILE NOT AN INCOMING NATO MEMBER 
LIKE MOST OTHERS IN THE V-10, CROATIA BELONGS TO THIS 
GROUP. 
 
2.   THERE HAVE BEEN FEW COMMENTARIES YET.  ONE WAS 
FEATURED PROMINENTLY IN THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY 
\"VJESNIK\" ON FEBRUARY 6 BY BRUNO LOPANDIC UNDER THE 
HEADLINE \"CROATIA WILL HAVE TO TAKE A CLEARER POSITION 
TOWARD THE IRAQI CRISIS.\"  LOPANDIC WROTE THAT THE VILNIUS 
GROUP STATEMENT WAS INITIATED BY BRUCE JACKSON.  HE NOTED 
THAT CROATIA\'S INSISTENCE ON SIGNING SUCH A DOCUMENT WILL 
\"FORCE THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE MORE CLEARLY\" HOW 
CROATIA SHOULD POSITION ITSELF ON THE ISSUE. 
 
3.   THERE HAS BEEN NO OFFICIAL GOC REACTION YET OTHER THAN 
THE V-10 STATEMENT TO THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION.  WE 
EXPECT MORE COMMENTARIES AND ANALYSIS IN COMING DAYS AND 
WILL REPORT SEPTEL. 
 
4.  FEBRUARY 6 HEADLINES IN THE CROATIAN DAILIES: 
 
-- ZAGREB-BASED MASS-CIRCULATION \"JUTARNJI LIST\" - \"SUPPORT

1.  (U) CROATIAN PRESIDENT MESIC AND OTHERS IN THE GOC HAVE 
BEEN LARGELY SUPPORTIVE SINCE SECRETARY POWELL\'S PRESENTATION 
TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON FEBRUARY 5.  THE AMBASSADOR SAW 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

TOMISLAV JAKIC, MESIC\'S FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR, AND MARIO 
NOBILO, ASSISTANT FOREIGN MINISTER FOR MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS, 
ON FEBRUARY 6, TO DISCUSS IRAQ AND DELIVER A TRANSCRIPT OF 
THE SECRETARY\'S SECURITY COUNCIL PRESENTATION. 
 
2.  (C) JAKIC SAID THAT MESIC PLANNED TO DELIVER A TOUGHLY 
WORDED STATEMENT (ADVANCE COPY PARA 5) TO THE NATION AT 7 PM 
ON FEBRUARY 6 CONVEYING CROATIA\'S POSITION ON IRAQ.  CROATIA 
WANTS TO SEE THE U.S. USE THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND TO PURSUE 
MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY IN ITS EFFORTS TO DISARM IRAQ, BUT AT 
THE END THE DAY, IRAQ MUST BE DISARMED.  ACCORDING TO JAKIC, 
PRESIDENT MESIC WAS NOT INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE GOC\'S 
SUPPORT FOR THE VILNIUS 10 STATEMENT (REFTEL B) ISSUED AFTER 
THE SECRETARY\'S UNSC PRESENTATION AND WANTED TO DO HIS PART 
IN READYING THE CROATIAN PEOPLE FOR THE DIFFICULT PERIOD 
AHEAD.  THE AMBASSADOR COMMENDED THE PRESIDENT\'S INITIATIVE. 
 
3.  (C) AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE AMBASSADOR HEARD A 
SIMILAR MESSAGE FROM ASSISTANT MINISTER NOBILO.  THE U.S. CAN 
COUNT ON CROATIA\'S SUPPORT, BUT HOPES THAT THE U.S. WILL MAKE 
EVERY EFFORT TO EXPLAIN ITS POLICIES CLEARLY, TAKING INTO 
ACCOUNT ARAB AUDIENCES, AND WORKING TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE 
THROUGH THE SECURITY COUNCIL.  HE NOTED THAT CROATIA HAD BEEN 
PUT IN AN \"UNPLEASANT\" SITUATION.  THERE WAS A SPLIT IN THE 
EU ON THE ISSUE AND THE GOC WAS BEING \"PUSHED FROM VARIOUS 
SIDES\" ON HOW TO REACT.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT THE U.S. 
WAS DOING EVERYTHING IT COULD TO WORK THE ISSUE IN THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL.  THE U.S. IS EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL REMAIN RELEVANT; PART OF THE COUNCIL\'S 
REMAINING RELEVANT, HE ADDED, INVOLVES ENFORCING EXISTING

SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS ON IRAQ.  THIS IS IN THE 
INTEREST OF THE U.S. AND THE UNITED NATIONS AS AN 
INSTITUTION.  OTHERWISE THE UN BECOMES THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. 
 
4.  (U) THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED TWO STATEMENTS ON 
FEBRUARY 5 ON THE SITUATION IN IRAQ.  THE FIRST EXPRESSED 
CROATIA\'S \"PARTNERSHIP AND SOLIDARITY\" WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORT TO DISARM IRAQ.  THE MFA UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR IRAQ 
TO HONOR \"UNCONDITIONALLY\" UN RESOLUTION 1441, WHICH CALLS 
FOR COMPLETE COOPERATION WITH THE UN INSPECTORS ON THE 
GROUND.  THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
POSES \"THE MOST SERIOUS THREAT\" TO SAFETY AND SECURITY IN THE 
WORLD TODAY.  THE MFA\'S SECOND STATEMENT WAS IN SUPPORT OF 
THE EU PRESIDENCY\'S FEBRUARY 4 APPEAL TO IRAQ.  ECHOING THE 
PRESIDENCY, THE MFA STATEMENT NOTED THAT THE DEADLINE WHICH 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD SET IN UNSC RESOLUTION 1441 
HAD PASSED AND THAT IRAQ MUST \"IMMEDIATELY AND 
UNCONDITIONALLY\" COMPLY WITH ALL UN RESOLUTIONS.  ALL UN 
MEMBER STATES MUST RESPECT UN DECISIONS \"FOR THE SAKE OF 
PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE WORLD.\"  (TRANSLATIONS EMAILED TO 
EUR/SCE NARDI.)

IRAQ AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  PART OF THIS INFORMATION 
CAN QUALIFY IN THE EVIDENCE CATEGORY, WHILE THE SECOND PART 
CONSISTS OF STRONG INDICATIONS.  BOTH LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION 
THAT DOUBTS ABOUT THE LACK OF THE BAGHDAD REGIME,S FULL 
COOPERATION WITH UN INSPECTORS ARE WELL-FOUNDED, AND THAT 
THIS VIOLATES SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1441 DATED NOVEMBER 
OF LAST YEAR, WHICH REQUESTS DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ IN THE 
CONTEXT OF POSSESSION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
 
      AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, I HAVE ON 
MORE THAN ONE OCCASION EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE 
CREATION AND OPERATION OF THE GLOBAL ANTI-TERRORIST 
COALITION.  I HAVE ALSO STRESSED THAT FACTORIES FOR THE 
PRODUCTION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AS WELL AS THE 
WEAPONS THEMSELVES, MUST BE PUT UNDER EFFICIENT INTERNATIONAL 
CONTROL, THAT IS, THAT THEY MUST BE DESTROYED IF SUCH CONTROL 
CANNOT BE IMPLEMENTED. 
 
      THIS CONTINUES TO BE MY STANDPOINT.  I AM CERTAIN THAT 
ALONG WITH IT I AM PROTECTING THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA,S AND 
ALL OF ITS CITIZENS, KEY INTERESTS, BECAUSE BOTH 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WHICH 
ARE NOT UNDER CONTROL, REPRESENT A POTENTIAL BUT VERY

      I ALSO REPEAT THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH CONCRETE

NECESSARY TO UNDERTAKE A LONG-TERM FIGHT AGAINST ITS ROOTS. 
I ALSO DEEM IT NECESSARY TO ONCE AGAIN POINT OUT THE 
COMPELLING PLACE AND ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS, BOTH IN THE

      THE BAGHDAD AUTHORITIES BEAR THE CRUCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY.  THEY HAVE TO PROVE IRREFUTABLY THAT THEY ARE 
FULLY COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED NATIONS INSPECTORS, IN 
OTHER WORDS, THEY MUST, IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER AND WITHOUT 
DELAY, PROVIDE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE INFORMATION 
PRESENTED BY THE UNITED STATES TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL. 
DENIAL IS NOT AN ANSWER THAT CAN SATISFY THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY.   INSPECTORS MUST BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR 
WORK ) NOT INDEFINITELY, OF COURSE. 
 
      BEFORE THE DECISION ON THE USE OF FORCE IS MADE, ONE 
HAS TO BE CERTAIN THAT ABSOLUTELY ALL OTHER MEANS FOR 
REALIZATION OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1441 HAVE BEEN 
USED. 
 
      INSPECTORS, THEREFORE, CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THEIR WORK 
INDEFINITELY, BUT THE OPTION OF WAR CANNOT BE RESORTED TO 
IMPRUDENTLY AND WITHOUT PREPARATION. 
 
      IF WE WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD OF PEACE, STABILITY, AND 
SECURITY, AND I AM CERTAIN THAT THAT,S WHAT WE ALL WANT, 
SOMETIMES WE CANNOT AVOID DIFFICULT DECISIONS. 
 
      A WISE MAN SAID LONG TIME AGO THAT THE LARGEST CRIME IS 
TO REFUSE TO FIGHT, WHEN THE FIGHT SHOULD NOT BE AVOIDED. 
 
      WE HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED THE TERROR OF WAR AND KNOW 
HOW TO APPRECIATE PEACE.  THAT,S WHY WE ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED 
TO RESOLVING ALL PROBLEMS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.  HOWEVER, WE 
ALSO KNOW THAT REPUBLIC OF CROATIA WOULD NOT EXIST IF WE HAD 
NOT FOUGHT, WHEN THE WAR WAS IMPOSED ON US.

STILL BELIEVE THAT A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION IS POSSIBLE AND WE

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEES 
OF THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT WILL HOLD A JOINT HEARING ON 
FEBRUARY 12 TO DISCUSS CROATIA\'S POLICY TOWARD POTENTIAL 
MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ.  SOME OF CROATIA\'S LEADING 
PARLIAMENTARIANS OBJECTED TO NOT BEING CONSULTED IN ADVANCE 
OF THE GOVERNMENT TAKING A STRONG PUBLIC STANCE WITH OTHER 
VILNIUS-10 STATES IN SUPPORT OF THE U.S. APPROACH ON IRAQ. 
IN A MEETING WITH THE CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
COMMITTEE ON FEBRUARY 7, WE WARNED THAT THIS ISSUE MUST NOT 
BE USED TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS; PRESIDENT MESIC\'S ADDRESS 
AND THE V-10 STATEMENT SENT A STRONG POSITIVE MESSAGE; THE 
SABOR SHOULD NOT SEEK TO DILUTE THIS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) MOST OF CROATIA\'S LEADING POLITICIANS, INCLUDING 
PRESIDENT MESIC, LEARNED OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION TO JOIN 
V-10 COUNTRIES ON FEBRUARY 5 IN A STRONG DECLARATION OF 
SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POSITION ON IRAQ (REF A) FROM PRESS 
REPORTING.  SOME OF CROATIA\'S POLITICIANS ARE OBJECTING TO 
THE STATEMENT, WHICH THEY CLAIM WAS TAKEN WITHOUT APPROPRIATE 
CONSULTATION.  AS HE OFTEN DOES, PRESIDENT MESIC TOOK THE 
HIGH ROAD, AND GAVE A TELEVISED ADDRESS ON FEBRUARY 6 (REF B) 
URGING PEACEFUL RESOLUTION THROUGH SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION, 
BUT STATED THAT \"IF A WAR FOR WHAT IS RIGHT IS INEVITABLE, 
THEN CROATIA KNOWS WHERE HER PLACE IS.\"  OTHER POLITICIANS 
HAVE BEEN LESS SUPPORTIVE, BUT MOST OBJECT MORE TO BEING 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

EXCLUDED FROM THE POLICY DECISION RATHER THAN TO THE MERITS 
OF SUPPORTING THE U.S. POSITION. 
 
3.  (C) JOZO RADOS AND IVO BANAC, PRESIDENTS OF TWO OF THE 
RULING COALITION\'S THREE \"JUNIOR PARTNER\" PARTIES, ISSUED 
STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE GOC POSITION ON IRAQ.  IVO 
SANADER, PRESIDENT OF CROATIA\'S OPPOSITION HDZ, MADE A 
STATEMENT ON FEBRUARY 6 THAT HIS PARTY \"GIVES ITS FULL 
SUPPORT TO PRESIDENT BUSH AND THE POLICY OF THE UNITED 
STATES.\"  (NOTE: THE HDZ DESPERATELY SEEKS INTERNATIONAL 
VALIDATION FOR ITS INCOMPLETE INTERNAL REFORM PROCESS SO IT 
CAN CONVINCE CROATIAN VOTERS IT IS NO LONGER THE CORRUPT, 
EXTREMIST PARTY OF FORMER PRESIDENT TUDJMAN.)  OPPOSITION 
HSLS PRESIDENT DRAZEN BUDISA SAID THAT HIS PARTY (WHICH WAS 
EJECTED FROM THE CURRENT COALITION IN JULY 2002) \"FOUND THE 
STAND OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE SO-CALLED OLD EUROPE MORE 
REASONABLE AND ACCEPTABLE THAN THAT OF THE VILNIUS GROUP.\" 
 
LAYING DOWN A MARKER: NO POLITICS ON IRAQ 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 7, WE MET WITH ANTE MARKOV (HSS, THE 
SECOND-LARGEST PARTY IN THE RULING COALITION), CHAIR OF THE 
PARLIAMENT\'S NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE.  A DAY EARLIER, 
MARKOV WAS QUOTED IN THE PRESS AS REFUSING TO COMMENT ON THE 
V-10 STATEMENT BECAUSE HE IS NOT CERTAIN \"IF THE POSITION 
EXPRESSED IS THE POSITION OF ALL CROATIA.\"  WE TOLD HIM 
BLUNTLY THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE ON WHICH TO PLAY POLITICS. 
MARKOV WAS QUICK TO EXPLAIN THAT HE AND ZDRAVKO TOMAC (SDP), 
CHAIR OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, TRIED WITHOUT SUCCESS 
TO REACH FM PICULA BEFORE THE STATEMENT WAS RELEASED IN ORDER 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00297  01 OF 02  071534Z 
TO DEVELOP A UNIFIED POSITION. 
 
5.  (C) MARKOV SAID THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 
POSITION EXPRESSED BY THE PRESIDENT IN HIS ADDRESS AND THE 
POSITION PUT FORWARD IN THE V-10 STATEMENT.  CROATIA SHOULD 
HAVE A UNIFIED POSITION.  THEREFORE, THE SABOR\'S NATIONAL 
SECURITY COMMITTEE AND THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HAVE 
AGREED TO HOLD A JOINT HEARING ON FEBRUARY 12 TO DEVELOP A 
UNIFIED POSITION. 
 
6.  (C) WE TOLD MARKOV THAT WHILE WE WOULD WELCOME AN EVEN 
BROADER CONSENSUS OF CROATIAN SUPPORT FOR OUR VIEW OF THE 
DANGERS PRESENTED BY IRAQ, WE CAUTIONED AGAINST DILUTING THE 
POWERFUL, POSITIVE MESSAGE THAT CROATIA HAS PUT INTO PLAY. 
WE CAUTIONED MARKOV THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS MUST NOT VIEW THEIR 
DECISION ON IRAQ AS CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE EU; 
WHILE THERE IS AS YET NO CONSENSUS WITHIN THE EU, SOME 
LEADING MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY MADE THEIR DECISION.  MARKOV 
WELCOMED OUR OFFER TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE MEETING WITH 
INFORMATION BASED ON SECRETARY POWELL\'S INTERVENTION AT THE 
UNSC.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE G. ROSSIN, REASONS 1.5(B) 
AND (D) AND 1.6 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C) THOMAS OSORIO, HEAD OF ICTY\'S ZAGREB OFFICE, TOLD US 
THAT OTP SPOKESPERSON FLORENCE HARTMANN\'S FEBRUARY 5 
STATEMENT CRITICIZING THE GOC FOR FAILING TO APPREHEND ICTY 
INDICTEE ANTE GOTOVINA AND FOR FAILING TO MEET ICTY 
INFORMATION REQUESTS REPRESENTS THE OPENING SALVO OF A NEW 
OTP BID TO PRESS THE GOC TO TAKE MORE VISIBLE ACTION TO 
ARREST THE FUGITIVE.  OSORIO SAID THE OTP IS \"CONVINCED\" THAT 
THE GOTOVINA IS HIDING IN CROATIA, BUT WAS UNWILLING (OR 
UNABLE) TO OFFER CONCRETE EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE HARTMANN\'S 
HARSH CLAIMS.  OSORIO, WHO WAS NOT/NOT CONSULTED BEFORE 
HARTMANN\'S PRESS STATEMENT, THOUGHT THAT HER CRITICISM OF GOC 
DOCUMENT SHARING LAPSES WAS OVERSTATED. 
 
2. (C) WHILE THE OTP OFTEN HAS GOOD REASON TO BE FRUSTRATED 
WITH THE GOC -- IT IS A RELUCTANT AND FAIR WEATHER PARTNER 
-- THE OTP URGENTLY NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS 
\"CROATIA ACCOUNT.\"  MISSTEPS IN THE NOW-SUSPENDED BOBETKO WAR 
CRIMES CASE, PARTICULARLY THE OTP DECISION NOT TO INTERVIEW 
THE SUSPECT BEFORE INDICTING HIM (REF C), HELPED FOSTER A 
CRISIS THAT WRACKED THE GOC IN FALL 2002, DIMINISHED ICTY\'S 
CREDIBILITY HERE AND COMPLICATED CROATIAN EU ASPIRATIONS WITH 
NOTHING TO SHOW FOR THE EFFORT.  WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS 
THE GOC ON GOTOVINA AND ICTY COOPERATION WRIT LARGE. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00305  01 OF 03  120643Z 
HOWEVER, PRESSURE MUST BE WELL ORCHESTRATED AND WELL THOUGHT 
OUT.  WITHOUT SOLID GROUNDING IN FACT, BETTER INTERNAL 
COORDINATION AND PRIOR CONSULTATION WITH US AND ICTY\'S OTHER 
SUPPORTERS, THE OTP\'S GOTOVINA \"STRATEGY\" MAY END UP BEING 
JUST ANOTHER FUTILE AND PYRRHIC CONFRONTATION WITH THE GOC. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
FIGHTING WORDS... 
----------------- 
 
3. (C)  IN THE STRONGEST LANGUAGE USED BY AN ICTY OFFICIAL 
SINCE THE CRISIS OVER GENERAL BOBETKO FLARED IN SEPTEMBER 
2002, HARTMANN ACCUSED THE GOC OF FAILING TO APPREHEND 
FUGITIVE CROATIAN GENERAL AND ICTY INDICTEE ANTE GOTOVINA. 
GOTOVINA, HARTMANN ALLEGED, WAS \"TRAVELING FREELY IN 
CROATIA.\"  HARTMANN ALSO ACCUSED THE GOC OF \"SELECTIVE, SLOW 
AND INCOMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR 
DOCUMENTS.\" 
 
4.  (C) IN LIGHT OF HARTMANN\'S STATEMENT, WE MET FEBRUARY 6 
WITH ICTY ZAGREB OFFICE RESREP THOMAS OSORIO (PROTECT 
THROUGHOUT).  ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT -- OR COULD NOT -- GO 
INTO DETAILS, OSORIO ASSERTED THAT THE OTP HAS EVIDENCE TO 
BACK UP HARTMANN\'S ACCUSATION ON GOTOVINA.  THERE ARE \"NEW 
SIGHTINGS AND NEW INFORMATION,\" ALTHOUGH HE SAID THAT NONE OF 
THE NEW LEADS ARE AS SOLID AS THE REPORTED SFOR SIGHTING OF 
GOTOVINA IN HERCEGOVINA IN 2002 (REF D).  IN SUM, ICTY NOW IS 
CONVINCED THAT GOTOVINA IS MOVING IN AND OUT OF CROATIA AND 
THAT THE GOC HAS NOT/NOT BEEN ACTING IN GOOD FAITH TO 
APPREHEND HIM.  OSORIO NOTED THAT IF THE EU MADE GOTOVINA\'S 
CAPTURE A PRECONDITION FOR ACTING ON CROATIA\'S EU MEMBERSHIP 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00305  01 OF 03  120643Z 
APPLICATION, THE GOC WOULD CAPTURE THE GENERAL WITHIN \"24 
HOURS.\" 
 
...AND A NEW OTP \"STRATEGY\" 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (C)  DURING OUR DISCUSSION, OSORIO CALLED HARTMANN AND 
CONFIRMED THAT HER STATEMENT WAS ISSUED UNDER INSTRUCTIONS 
FROM CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE.  OSORIO CONCLUDED THAT HER 
STATEMENT WAS THE OPENING SALVO OF A NEW ICTY \"STRATEGY\" TO 
FORCE THE GOC TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION TO FIND GOTOVINA, OR 
SHOULD THE GOC BALK, DEMONSTRATE CATEGORICALLY THAT CROATIA 
IS FAILING TO COMPLY WITH ITS ICTY OBLIGATIONS.   ACCORDING 
TO OSORIO, THIS STRATEGY WOULD CALL FOR CROATIAN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TO CONDUCT HIGH VISIBILITY RAIDS ON GOTOVINA\'S 
HOMES, INTERVIEW GOTOVINA\'S ATTORNEYS AND ASSOCIATES AND 
MOUNT ROADBLOCKS IN AREAS OF DALMATIA WHERE THE SUSPECT IS 
BELIEVED TO FREQUENT.  ICTY STAFF WILL ACTIVELY MONITOR THESE 
AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND MAY SEEK TO ACCOMPANY THE POLICE ON 
THEIR RAIDS TO VERIFY GOC COMPLIANCE. 
 
6. (C) OSORIO SAID THAT THIS NEW AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY HAS BEEN 
THE CAUSE OF MUCH DEBATE WITHIN ICTY BETWEEN \"ACTIVISTS,\" WHO 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

WANT TO USE ICTY\'S LEVERAGE TO PUSH THE GOC TO FIND GOTOVINA,

FINDINGS.  (OSORIO LISTED HIMSELF AND CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL 
PONTE AS \"ACTIVISTS.\")  OSORIO SAID THAT THE ICTY ALREADY HAS 
RECEIVED A PROTEST NOTE FROM THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IN THE 
HAGUE ACCUSING THE TRIBUNAL OF A DOUBLE STANDARD FOLLOWING 
DEL PONTE\'S SPEECH TO THE UN LAST OCTOBER -- A SPEECH IN 
WHICH SHE DECLARED SERBIA TO BE IN NON-COMPLIANCE FOR ITS 
FAILURE TO DELIVER RATKO MLADIC, BUT ONLY WARNED CROATIA OVER 
ITS FAILURE TO DELIVER GOTOVINA.  OSORIO EXPECTS MORE 
COMPLAINTS FROM THE RUSSIANS OVER THE OTP\'S GOTOVINA GAMBIT; 
HE ANTICIPATED THAT THE RUSSIANS WILL INSIST AGAIN THAT ICTY 
SHOULD DECLARE CROATIA NON-COMPLIANT.  HOWEVER, OSORIO ARGUES 
THAT, UNLIKE THE MLADIC CASE, THE OTP NEEDS TO PRESS FOR 
VISIBLE ACTION TO DEBUNK THE GOC ARGUMENT THAT GOTOVINA FLED 
THE REGION. 
 
WHERE\'S THE PROOF? 
------------------ 
 
7. (C) OTP FRUSTRATION WITH GOC PASSIVITY ON GOTOVINA IS 
UNDERSTANDABLE; THE GOC DREADS THE PROSPECT OF HAVING TO 
TRANSFER GOTOVINA TO THE HAGUE AND DESPERATELY DOES NOT WANT 
THE GENERAL TO BE IN CROATIA.  HOWEVER, OUR EXPERIENCE WITH 
MUCH OF WHAT WE KNOW OF THE OTP\'S \"EVIDENCE\" ON GOTOVINA IS 
THAT IT IS BASED ON CIRCULAR REPORTING AND HEARSAY.  WHILE 
GOTOVINA VERY WELL MAY BE IN THE REGION, WE HAVE SEEN 
NOTHING, ASIDE FROM THE SFOR SIGHTING, TO UNDERPIN THE HARSH 
OTP STATEMENT THAT GOTOVINA IS \"WALKING FREELY\" IN CROATIA 
(AND WE HAVE BEEN ASKING OSORIO AND THE CROATIANS FOR 
MONTHS).  PER REF B, OTP POLITICAL ADVISOR JEAN-JAQUES JORIS 
TOLD OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE HAGUE THAT \"CROATIAN AND FOREIGN 
SOURCES\" SUPPORTED THE OTP CLAIM THAT GOTOVINA WAS MOVING 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00305  02 OF 03  120644Z 
FREELY IN CROATIA.  HE SAID THAT THE CROATIAN SOURCE WAS (OR 
INCLUDED) PRESIDENT MESIC.  HOWEVER, MESIC\'S FOREIGN POLICY 
ADVISOR TOLD US THAT MESIC BASED HIS STATEMENT ON A CROATIAN 
INTELLIGENCE REPORT, WHICH, WE KNOW FOR A FACT, WAS BASED ON 
A FALSE SIGHTING OF GOTOVINA IN ZAGREB AND OTHER CIRCULAR 
REPORTING.  OTHER REPORTED \"SIGHTINGS\" OF GOTOVINA HAVE 
PROVEN TO BE EQUALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. 
 
DOCUMENT SHARING 
---------------- 
 
8. (C) OSORIO SAID HE WAS NOT CONSULTED BEFORE HARTMANN 
ISSUED HER STATEMENT.  IN HIS VIEW CRITICISM OF THE GOC\'S 
PERFORMANCE ON INFORMATION SHARING WAS OVERSTATED AND THE 
GOC, AS A RULE, WAS RESPONSIVE ON DOCUMENT REQUESTS. 
ACCORDING TO OSORIO, THERE ARE THREE OUTSTANDING DOCUMENT 
DELIVERY PROBLEMS:  1) THE GOC HAS FAILED TO DELIVER BODY 
COUNT AND AUTOPSY RESULTS CONDUCTED BY THE CROATIAN MILITARY 
AFTER OPERATION STORM; 2) THE GOC HAS NOT MET A DEADLINE TO 
PROVIDE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WHICH ICTY NEEDS TO HELP DEMONSTRATE 
YUGOSLAV ETHNIC CLEANSING FOR THE MILOSEVIC TRIAL; AND 3) THE 
GOC HAS MISSED A NUMBER OF DEADLINES ON INFORMATION LINKED TO 
INVESTIGATIONS OF CROATIAN WAR CRIMES IN BOSNIA.  IN THE CASE 
OF THE FIRST TWO DOCUMENT SHARING ISSUES, OSORIO TOLD US THAT 
THE GOC FAILURE TO DELIVER THE DOCUMENTS WAS A TECHNICAL, 
SHORT-TERM HICCUP.  IN FACT, IN THE CASE OF THE BODY COUNT 
INFORMATION, OSORIO SAID THAT HE HAD OBTAINED A BOOTLEG COPY 
FROM THE HEAD OF THE GOC COMMISSION FOR MISSING PERSONS.  IN 
THE CASE OF THE OUTSTANDING BIH INFORMATION, THE ISSUE COULD 
HAVE BEEN HANDLED \"THROUGH REGULAR CHANNELS,\" OSORIO 
ASSERTED. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00305  02 OF 03  120644Z 
 
9.  (C) ALTHOUGH PROBLEMS EXIST, THERE IS ALSO PROGRESS. 
OSORIO CONFIRMED THAT THE GOC GAVE PERMISSION FOR THE OTP AND 
THE CROATIAN PROSECUTORS\' OFFICE TO BEGIN TO SHARE 
INFORMATION DIRECTLY.  AN ICTY PROSECUTOR WAS SENT TO ZAGREB 
FEBRUARY 5 TO WORK WITH HIS COUNTERPARTS TO SOLIDIFY THE 
CROATIAN CASE AGAINST LOWER LEVEL PERPETRATORS IN THE MEDAK 
POCKET AND TO SEEK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BOLSTER THE 
OTP\'S CASE AGAINST GENERAL ADEMI FOR CRIMES COMMITTED IN THE 
SAME OPERATION. 
 
BOBETKO: CASE FROZEN 
-------------------- 
 
10.  (C) OSORIO CONFIRMED THAT, AFTER REVIEWING THE ICTY 
MEDICAL SPECIALISTS\' REPORT, CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE 
RECOMMENDED TO THE PRESIDING JUDGE THAT THE TRIAL OF FORMER 
CROATIAN CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF JANKO BOBETKO BE 
SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF HIS POOR HEALTH.  ICTY WILL SEND ANOTHER 
MEDICAL TEAM TO ZAGREB IN THREE TO FOUR MONTHS TO REVIEW 
BOBETKO\'S HEALTH, BUT BARRING A MIRACULOUS RECOVERY FROM 
PROGRESSIVE HEART AND RENAL FAILURE, OTP\'S PURSUIT OF THE 
HIGHEST RANKING CROATIAN TO BE INDICTED BY ICTY IS AT AND 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

END.  OSORIO DID NOT INDICATE THAT THE OTP WOULD CONDUCT A 
\"LESSONS LEARNED\" EXERCISE OVER BOBETKO.  HE DID EXPRESS 
HOPE, HOWEVER, THAT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE BOBETKO CRISIS, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00305  03 OF 03  120645Z 
ICTY FINALLY WOULD ESTABLISH THE BASIC STANDARDS WHICH WOULD 
HELP PROSECUTORS DETERMINE THE FITNESS OF AN INDICTEE TO 
STAND TRIAL. 
 
11. (C) WITH BOBETKO OUT OF THE PICTURE, THE OTP IS 
STRUGGLING TO MAKE SENSE OF ITS PROSECUTION STRATEGY FOR THE 
ENTIRE MEDAK POCKET WAR CRIMES CASE.  BOBETKO WAS AT THE TOP 
OF THE PYRAMID OF THE MILITARY CHAIN OF COMMAND -- INDICTEE 
RAHIM ADEMI WAS THE CHIEF MILITARY OFFICER IN THE FIELD. 
GENERAL MIRKO NORAC, WHOSE INDICTMENT WAS DEFERRED AT THE 
REQUEST OF THE GOC SO THAT IT COULD TRY A SEPARATE WAR CRIMES 
CASE (\"GOSPIC\") LOCALLY, HEADED THE CROATIAN MILITARY UNIT 
PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATROCITIES AT MEDAK.  WITH 
BOBETKO GONE, OSORIO SAID THAT THE OTP WILL HAVE TO REEXAMINE 
THE INDICTMENT AGAINST ADEMI AND THE PENDING INDICTMENT 
AGAINST NORAC.  (OSORIO TOLD US THAT ICTY RECENTLY HAD 
DISCUSSED WITH CHIEF PROSECUTOR MLADEN BAJIC THE POSSIBILITY 
THAT HE INCLUDE NORAC IN THE LOCAL CROATIAN INDICTMENT OF 
LOWER-LEVEL SOLDIERS THAT BAJIC IS PREPARING.) 
 
12. (C) ACCORDING TO OSORIO, MEDAK IS IMPORTANT FOR ICTY, NOT 
JUST BECAUSE THE OTP BELIEVES THIS TO BE ONE OF THEIR 
STRONGEST CROATIA CASES, BUT BECAUSE IT WILL BE A TEST-BED 
FOR ITS EFFORTS TO PROVE THAT THE GOC CONCEPTUALIZED AND 
PRE-PLANNED THE 1995 OPERATION STORM AS AN ETHNIC CLEANSING 
OPERATION.  OSORIO HAS TOLD US THAT THE PROSECUTION BELIEVES 
IT HAS EVIDENCE THAT THE SAME ORGANIZED TECHNIQUES TO RAZE 
SERB VILLAGES IN MEDAK WERE USED ON A WIDER SCALE AFTER 
OPERATION STORM. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (C) THE OTP IS UNDERSTANDABLY FRUSTRATED.  THE BOBETKO 
CASE, AND YEARS AND YEARS OF WORK, IS SLIPPING AWAY WITHOUT A 
DAY IN COURT.  JUSTICE IS DENIED AND THE GOC, WHICH EVADED 
FOR MONTHS ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT AS ICTY\'S AGENT ON THE 
CASE, HAS COME OUT THE WINNER.  THE BRITISH, WHO WENT OUT ON 
A LIMB TO SUPPORT THE OTP ON BOBETKO BY SUSPENDING CROATIA\'S 
STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT, ARE FURIOUS WITH THE 
OTP ABOUT THIS.  SO ARE WE.  IN THE PROCESS OF BACKING DEL 
PONTE, WE DAMAGED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
GORAN GRANIC, ONE OF THE GOC\'S KEY DECISIONMAKERS.  AS A 
RESULT OF THE BOBETKO CRISIS, THOSE IN CROATIA -- INCLUDING 
THOSE WITHIN THE GOC -- WHO ARGUED THAT CROATIA SHOULD HOLD 
FIRM FOR A SOLUTION MORE TO ITS LIKING WERE VINDICATED.  THEY 
MAY BE EMBOLDENED TO TAKE THE SAME HARD, \"WE KNOW BETTER,\" 
STANCE ON NEW ICTY INDICTMENTS OR ON OTHER THORNY ISSUES SUCH 
AS REFUGEE RETURN. 
 
14. (C) THE OTP\'S ACTIONS HAVE ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR 
CROATIA, THE REGION AND US.  BOBETKO\'S REAL AND SERIOUS 
MEDICAL AILMENTS WERE WELL KNOWN -- A RESPECTED CROATIAN 
HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR SHORTLY AFTER BOBETKO 
WAS INDICTED THAT \"NO ONE WHO KNEW BOBETKO\'S MEDICAL 
CONDITION WOULD HAVE INDICTED HIM,\" AND WONDERED WHY DEL 
PONTE DECIDED NOT TO DO SO.  AS REPORTED REF D, DEL PONTE -- 
DESPITE GOC REQUESTS AND OTP STAFF INTENT -- PASSED UP AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW THE 83-YEAR OLD GENERAL BEFORE 
ISSUING THE INDICTMENT, APPARENTLY FOR NO SOLID REASON. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00305  03 OF 03  120645Z 
15. (C) HARTMANN\'S UNSUBSTANTIATED STATEMENT, THE OTP\'S LACK 
OF CONSULTATION WITH ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVE ON THE GROUND, 
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A \"STRATEGY\" WITHOUT PRIOR DISCUSSION 
WITH THE ICTY\'S INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPPORTERS SUGGESTS 
THAT THE OTP WILL STUMBLE AGAIN, THIS TIME ON THE GOTOVINA 
CASE.  THE OTP MUST DO BETTER.  AS A FIRST STEP, WE SHOULD 
DEMAND THAT THE OTP PRESENT TO US ITS EVIDENCE THAT GOTOVINA 
IS \"FREELY MOVING\" IN CROATIA.  AS THINGS STAND, WE ARE 
SKEPTICAL OTP HAS EVIDENCE -- WE SHOULD DEMAND TO KNOW.  IF 
IT DOES HAVE EVIDENCE AND IT IS CREDIBLE,  WE SHOULD INSIST 
THAT THE OTP CONSULT WITH US AND THE BRITISH ABOUT ITS 
\"STRATEGY\" FOR PRESSING THE GOC TO ACT.  THE QUESTION IS NOT 
WHETHER WE SHOULD PRESS THE GOC ON WAR CRIMES AND ICTY 
COOPERATION, BUT HOW TO ORCHESTRATE THAT PRESSURE TO THE BEST 
EFFECT.  OTHERWISE, WE RISK GOING OUT ON A LIMB AGAIN FOR DEL 
PONTE ONLY TO HAVE IT BREAK UNDER US.

1.  THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 6. 
 
2.  WE SENT USTR ZOELLICK\'S LETTER ON THE U.S. TRIPS 
MORATORIUM TO MINISTER OF ECONOMY JURCIC UNDER COVER OF A 
NOTE FROM THE AMBASSADOR JANUARY 2 (REF A), WITH COPIES TO 
THE MINISTERS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND HEALTH.  WE PASSED REF B 
FOLLOW-UP POINTS JANUARY 31.  ON FEBRUARY 11 THE AMBASSADOR 
DISCUSSED THE ISSUE WITH GORDAN MARKOTIC, CURRENTLY HEAD OF 
THE MFA\'S DEPARTMENT FOR ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS, AND SOON TO 
BE CROATIA\'S REPRESENTATIVE IN GENEVA.  ON THE SAME DAY, WE 
MET WITH ASSISTANT MINISTER OF ECONOMY OLGICA SPEVEC TO 
OBTAIN THE GOC\'S OFFICIAL RESPONSE. 
 
3.  MARKOTIC NOTED THAT CROATIA DID NOT OPPOSE THE U.S. 
MORATORIUM, BUT DID LOOK AT IT AS AN INTERIM STEP.  HE 
EXPRESSED HOPE THAT A MULTILATERAL PERMANENT SOLUTION WOULD 
BE FOUND SOON, AND THAT CROATIA WOULD SUPPORT ANY CONSENSUS 
SOLUTION. 
 
4.  AT THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, SPEVEC SAID CROATIA HAD 
SUPPORTED THE CHAIRMAN\'S TEXT OF DECEMBER 16.  HOWEVER, IT 
WOULD WELCOME ANY MULTILATERAL SOLUTION.  IT WOULD EVEN JOIN 
A MORATORIUM, IF ALL WTO MEMBERS AGREED (IT APPEARED THAT 
SPEVEC THOUGHT THAT GETTING ALL 140 PLUS MEMBERS OF THE WTO 
TO AGREE WOULD BE DIFFICULT.) 
 
5.  THE GOC WAS CONCERNED THERE COULD BE LEGAL PROBLEMS IF IT 
JOINED A MORATORIUM THAT WAS NOT ACCEPTED BY ALL WTO MEMBERS. 
 FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO COMMIT TO SUCH A COURSE, IT MIGHT BE 
NECESSARY TO ASK FOR CHANGES IN ITS PATENTS LAW.  WHILE THE

CROATIA\'S PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FROM SEEKING RELIEF IN

WOULD INDUCE U.S. DRUG COMPANIES TO GIVE UP THEIR RIGHTS TO 
CHALLENGE EXPORTS TO THIRD PARTIES OF PATENTED DRUGS.

1. (C) THE CROATIAN POLICE ARE TRYING TO CONFIRM THE 
CREDIBILITY OF INFORMATION INDICATING THAT ICTY INDICTEE ANTE 
GOTOVINA WAS HIDING IN BOSNIA, NEAR THE CROATIAN BORDER, IN 
JANUARY 2003.  THAT IS WHAT BORIS SPUDIC, ASSISTANT HEAD OF 
CROATIAN CRIMINAL POLICE TOLD RSO DURING AN MEETING -- HELD 
AT SPUDIC\'S REQUEST -- LATE ON FEBRUARY 7.  SPUDIC SAID THAT 
HE ALSO WAS PASSING THIS INFORMATION TO THE BRITISH AND OTHER 
WESTERN EUROPEAN CONTACTS.  SPUDIC WOULD NOT COMMENT ON THE 
IDENTITY OR RELIABILITY OF THE SOURCE, BUT OFFERED TO 
RECONTACT HIM IF WE FOUND THE MATERIAL USEFUL AND ACCURATE.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
4. (C) THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE GOTOVINA\'S DISAPPEARANCE 
18 MONTHS AGO THAT THE CROATIAN INTERIOR MINISTRY HAS PASSED 
US INFORMATION ON THE ICTY FUGITIVE.  IT COMES AT A TIME WHEN 
THE GOC FINDS ITSELF UNDER MOUNTING PRESSURE FROM THE 
PROSECUTOR\'S OFFICE AT THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL TO DEMONSTRATE THAT 
IT IS TAKING ACTIVE MEASURES TO FIND GOTOVINA. 
 
5. (C) WE DEFER TO EMBASSY SARAJEVO AND OTHERS TO ASSESS THE 
QUALITY OF THE GOC INFORMATION AND WOULD WELCOME ANY ANALYSIS 
THAT WE CAN PASS TO SPUDIC ON HIS LEAD.  WE NOTE THAT VINKO 
ZULJEVIC \"KLICA\" IS IMPRISONED IN ZAGREB PENDING TRIAL FOR 
THE JUNE 2002 MURDER OF A ALLEGED CROATIAN INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCY INFORMANT, VESELIN MARINOV.  \"KLICA,\" A BOSNIAN CROAT, 
IS A WELL KNOWN CROATIAN MAFIA FIGURE, WHO REPORTEDLY SERVED 
IN THE NOTORIOUS \"CONVICTS\" BRIGADE OF ICTY INDICTEE MLADEN

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) THE GOC IS REACTING TO IC PRESSURE ON REFUGEE RETURNS. 
 MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS AND RECONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING, 
RADIMIR CACIC, HELD A HASTILY ARRANGED MEETING ON FEBRUARY 4 
WITH THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY TO PRESENT HIS MINISTRY,S 
PROGRAM ON REFUGEE RETURN.  THE EVENT AT THE SHERATON HOTEL 
WAS HEAVILY ATTENDED BY TELEVISION AND PRINT MEDIA.  THE 
MINISTER WAS COMBATIVE.  MUCH OF WHAT CACIC SAID WAS OLD NEWS 
AND FILLED WITH QUESTIONABLE FIGURES ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT,S 
EFFORTS THUS FAR.  HE DID, HOWEVER, ANNOUNCE A NEW INITIATIVE 
AIMED AT RESTORING LOST OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS.  HE 
CHASTISED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR ITS LACK OF 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, CRITICIZED THE GOC 
AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR ITS SHORTCOMINGS ON RETURN-RELATED 
ISSUES. 
 
2. (C) MANY IC OFFICIALS AGREED THAT CACIC,S PRESENTATION 
WAS LONG ON STYLE BUT SHORT ON SUBSTANCE.  THE HASTY EVENT 
OBVIOUSLY WAS DESIGNED TO PUSH BACK STRONGER IC PRESSURE ON 
THE GOC ON RETURNS.  THE GOC MISSED ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO 
CONVINCE THE IC THAT IT IS WILLING TO MAKE MEANINGFUL 
PROGRESS ON RETURNS AND TO WORK WITH THE IC IN DOING SO. THAT 
SAID, THE GOC\'S PUSHING BACK IS SOFTENING SOME IC RESOLVE, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUMMARY. 
 
GOC LAYS OUT RED CARPET TREATMENT 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) IN WHAT MANY IC OFFICIALS CONSIDERED AN UNUSUAL VENUE 
TO HOLD A MEETING ON REFUGEE RETURNS, GOC OFFICIALS, LED BY 
CACIC, HOSTED ALMOST ONE HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE 
DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY AT THE SHERATON HOTEL.  TELEVISION AND 
PRINT MEDIA PRESENCE WAS EXTENSIVE.  CACIC USED THE OCCASION 
TO REVIEW THE GOVERNMENT,S PERFORMANCE ON REFUGEE-RELATED 
ISSUES SINCE COMING TO POWER IN 2000 AND TO HIGHLIGHT NEW GOC 
PLANS TO ACCELERATE THE RETURN OF REFUGEES.  HE WANTED THIS 
EVENT TO BE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL AND ACTED MORE LIKE A 
LECTURER THAN MINISTER.  HIS GOAL WAS TO SHOW THAT THE GOC 
REGARDED THE ISSUE OF RETURNS WITH GREAT IMPORTANCE. 
 
CACIC:  I,M IN CHARGE 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) CACIC,S DEMEANOR THROUGHOUT THE PRESENTATION WAS 
INTENDED TO DISPEL ANY NOTION THAT ANYONE ELSE BESIDE HIMSELF 
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REFUGEE-RELATED MATTERS.  CACIC PRESENTED 
HIS DEPUTY AND ASSISTANT MINISTERS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
REFUGEE RETURNS, BUT DID MOST OF THE TALKING.  HE ASSUMED 
DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GOC,S RECORD ON RETURNS OVER 
THE PAST THREE YEARS.  HE REMINDED THE AUDIENCE THAT HIS 
MINISTRY WAS HAMPERED BY LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT.  ONLY LAST FALL WERE THE MOST CRUCIAL PARTS OF 
THIS LEGISLATION AMENDED, WHICH, HE SAID, HELPED REMOVE ALL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00337  01 OF 04  121720Z 
OF THE LEGISLATIVE BARRIERS TO RETURN.  HE SAID HE WAS NOT 
SATISFIED WITH RESULTS TO DATE; HE QUESTIONED HIS ASSISTANT 
MINISTERS ABOUT THE LACK OF PROGRESS AND FOUND MANY OF THEIR 
RESPONSES TO BE UNACCEPTABLE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME OF 
THEIR \"JUSTIFICATIONS,\" AS HE REFERRED TO THEM, DEALT WITH 
FINANCIAL AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT 
WERE OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. 
EU MEMBERSHIP AT STAKE 
---------------------- 
 
5. (C) CACIC INSISTED THAT THE DISCONTENT IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REFLECTED A LACK OF INFORMATION.  HE 
SAID HE INTENDS TO HAVE A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH THE IC TO 
SHARE INFORMATION AND AVOID FUTURE MISUNDERSTANDINGS.  THIS 
IS IMPORTANT, HE SAID, BECAUSE CROATIA WILL SOON SUBMIT ITS 
APPLICATION TO JOIN THE EU AND CROATIA IS HELPED BY GETTING 
MORE INFORMATION OUT.  HIS TOP PRIORITIES ARE RECONSTRUCTION 
AND PROPERTY RETURNS.  SINCE 2000 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN 
THE GOC,S ATTITUDE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, 
CACIC SAID: THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HELPED ONLY ETHNIC CROATS 
WHILE THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HELPS ALL OF ITS CITIZENS.

INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS A SORE POINT FOR CACIC, AND AT 
TIMES HE CONVEYED HIS FRUSTRATION.  HE EXPRESSED GRATITUDE 
FOR THE EU-SPONSORED HOUSING PROGRAM BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE 
GERMAN NGO ARBEITER-SAMARITER-BUND (ASB) AS HIS MINISTRY,S 
KEY PARTNER IN HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS.  UNDER THIS 
PROGRAM, ASB WILL RECONSTRUCT 1000 HOUSES.  HE NOTED THAT 
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND COUNTRIES, INCLUDING UNHCR, THE EU, 
AND U.S., ARE PROVIDING IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO RETURNING 
REFUGEES THROUGH THEIR VARIOUS PROGRAMS.  LOANS FROM 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ENABLED THE GOC TO 
MAKE PROGRESS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.  YET, WHILE CACIC 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT HAS HAD A DIRECT 
IMPACT, HE CLAIMED THE IC HAS SPENT ONLY ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT 
OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT SPENT ON RECONSTRUCTION SINCE 1996. 
 
7. (C) CACIC SAID HE EXPECTED GREATER UNHCR INVOLVEMENT 
DURING WHAT HE SAID WOULD BE A CRITICAL YEAR FOR RETURNS (REF 
A).  THIS WAS BECAUSE THREE-FOURTHS OF THE GOVERNMENT,S 
RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS WILL BENEFIT RETURNING SERBS.  HE SAID 
HE REGRETTED THAT IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THE PROGRAMS TO HAVE A 
DIRECT IMPACT ON THE SERB POPULATION.  THE GOC PLANS TO ISSUE 
7,500 DECISIONS FOR RECONSTRUCTION THIS YEAR, WHICH WILL MAKE 
IT POSSIBLE FOR AT LEAST 20,000 PEOPLE TO RETURN IF THEY 
CHOOSE TO DO SO ONCE THEIR HOUSES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.  HE 
CLAIMED THAT SINCE SEPTEMBER 2002, ALMOST 940 PROPERTIES HAVE 
BEEN REPOSSESSED.  THE GOC PLANS TO RETURN ALL HOMES TO THEIR 
RIGHTFUL OWNERS BY THE END OF 2003. 
 
NEW INITIATIVE TO RESTORE TENANCY RIGHTS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00337  02 OF 04  121721Z 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) CACIC,S DECLARATION THAT THE GOC WOULD SEEK TO 
RESTORE LOST OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS SPARKED THE 
GREATEST ATTENTION FROM HIS AUDIENCE.  HE SAID THAT IN THE 
AREAS OF SPECIAL STATE CONCERN (\"ASSC\" -- WAR-AFFECTED AREAS) 
ALL CITIZENS WERE VICTIMS OF THE WAR AND HAVE A RIGHT TO 
RETURN, TO QUALIFY FOR HOUSING CARE AND TO PURCHASE THEIR 
FORMER RIGHTS.  FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVED OUTSIDE THE ASSC (THAT 
IS MOST FORMER OTR HOLDERS), THEY WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE 
GOC,S PROGRAM ON PUBLICLY FUNDED HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.  A 
NEW LAW WILL BE ENACTED THAT WILL CALL FOR THE FORMULATION OF 
LISTS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF WHO CAN QUALIFY FOR SUCH 
ASSISTANCE. 
 
9. (C) UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE MINISTER EXPLAINED, THERE WOULD 
BE TWO POSSIBILITIES: OWNERSHIP AND RENT.  UNDER THE 
OWNERSHIP PROGRAM, LOANS WILL BE OFFERED WHICH THE OWNERS 
WILL HAVE TO REPAY OVER A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD.  THE RENT 
PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT WILL ALLOW THE PERSON TO 
PAY RENT FOR A REQUIRED PERIOD OF TIME, AFTER WHICH HE WILL 
BECOME THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY.  CACIC ENVISIONED A 4-YEAR 
PERIOD TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM.  FORMER TENANCY RIGHT 
HOLDERS WILL BE GIVEN A ONE-YEAR DEADLINE TO APPLY AND 2 TO 3 
YEARS FOR THE PROPERTIES TO BE BUILT.  THE GOC WILL EARMARK 
FUNDS FOR THE PROGRAM BY THE END OF THE YEAR, AND CACIC SAID 
IT EXPECTS THE PROGRAM WILL BE COMPLETED BY 2006. 
 
10. (C) CACIC PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A HIGH NUMBER 
OF APPLICATIONS FROM SERBS CURRENTLY LIVING IN 
SERBIA-MONTENEGRO AND BIH.  THESE ARE THE POPULATIONS THE IC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00337  02 OF 04  121721Z 
WANTED TO RETURN TO CROATIA.  MANY OF THE SERBS THAT WOULD 
QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM DO NOT WANT TO RETURN TO CROATIA BUT 
WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL ANY PROPERTY PROVIDED TO THEM, 
AN OUTCOME STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE GOC.   THE PROGRAM AS 
OUTLINED BY CACIC IS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE WHO 
REALLY WANT TO RETURN.  HE STATED THAT THE GOC DID NOT 
CURRENTLY HAVE THE MONEY TO INITIATE THE PROGRAM BUT WOULD 
RESOLVE THE FUNDING ISSUE SOON.  IT HAD TO IN ORDER TO 
RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS ONCE AND 
FOR ALL.  HE STRESSED THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL 
THE PROPERTIES OBTAINED THROUGH THE PROGRAM. 
 
CONTENTIOUS QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD 
-------------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) A BRIEF QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD FOLLOWED CACIC,S 
REMARKS.  THE MINISTER BECAME IRRITATED AND CONFRONTATIONAL 
WHEN OSCE HEAD PETER SEMNEBY ASKED FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE TENANCY RIGHTS INITIATIVE, NOTABLY WHEN WOULD THE 
ONE-YEAR DEADLINE BEGIN FOR FORMER TENANCY RIGHTS HOLDERS. 
CACIC RESPONDED THAT HE WOULD WAIT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO DO.  THIS WAY, THE IC COULD NOT 
SAY THAT THE GOC SET A SHORT DEADLINE THAT WAS DISCRIMINATORY 
AGAINST SERBS WHO DID NOT RESIDE IN CROATIA.  CACIC SAID HE 
WOULD SIGN ANY PROPOSAL THE IC SUBMITTED TO HIM, BUT THEN HE 
DID NOT WANT TO HEAR COMPLAINTS AFTERWARDS.

12.  (C) OTHER LEADING IC REPS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT RENTAL 
COMPENSATION FOR CURRENT OWNERS WHO ARE NOT OCCUPYING THEIR 
PROPERTIES AND FOR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE LOOTING OF 
PROPERTIES BY TEMPORARY OCCUPANTS AS THEY VACATE THEM.  CACIC 
REPLIED THAT THE GOC WILL PROVIDE RENTAL COMPENSATION TO 
THOSE WHO QUALIFY UNDER THE LAW BUT HE DID NOT SAY WHEN IT 
WOULD BEGIN.  AS FOR LOOTING, CACIC SAID THE GOC DID NOT HAVE 
THE MONEY TO COMPENSATE EVERYONE WHOSE PROPERTY HAD BEEN 
LOOTED.  HE EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT CROATIA WAS BEING ASKED 
TO PROVIDE SUCH COMPENSATION WHEN NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE 
REGION WAS ASKED TO DO SO. 
 
INCREASING THE STAKES 
--------------------- 
 
13. (C) IC PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO STEP UP TO THE RETURNS 
ISSUE HAS INCREASED RECENTLY IN WAYS IT APPARENTLY CANNOT 
IGNORE.  WE NEED TO JUDGE THE GOC BY ITS ACTIONS AND BY 
RESULTS ON THE GROUND, NOT BY RHETORIC OR DECLARATIONS.  SO 
FAR, WHAT IS CLEAR -- CACIC\'S PERSONAL LEAD MADE THIS CLEAR 
-- IS THAT MORE CAREFULLY \"MANAGING\" THE RETURNS ISSUE WITH 
THE IC IS PART OF THE GOC\'S EFFORT TO MAINTAIN MOMENTUM 
TOWARD THE EU AND NATO.  IT WAS LESS OBVIOUS THAT ACTUALLY 
SOLVING THIS BIG PROBLEM IS ON THE GOC\'S AGENDA -- MOST OF 
WHAT CACIC TALKED ABOUT WAS EITHER OLD HAT TO THOSE WHO WORK 
THESE ISSUES OR INSUFFICIENTLY DETAILED TO BE GROUNDS FOR 
CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOC IS TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF. 
 
14. (C) THIS EVENT WAS ONLY THE LATEST SIGN THAT THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00337  03 OF 04  121721Z 
INCREASED IC PRESSURE IS REACHING AND RESONATING AT THE 
HIGHEST GOC LEVELS, AND THAT THE GOC KNOWS THE STAKES HAVE 
INCREASED.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PLAN TO ADDRESS THE 
OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS PROBLEM IS PROOF OF THAT; THE 
ISSUE HAS LANGUISHED SINCE THE IC RAISED IT, TO LITTLE 
EFFECT, WITH PM RACAN IN DECEMBER 2001.  ON ITS FACE, CACIC\'S 
PLAN WOULD REPRESENT A REAL STEP FORWARD, BUT THE SHORTFALL 
HERE ALWAYS IS IMPLEMENTATION AND WE WILL BE WATCHING 
CAREFULLY.  CACIC\'S PRESENTATION LEFT US NO MORE CONVINCED 
THAN BEFORE THAT THE GOC HAS ANY REAL DESIRE, WILL OR INTENT 
TO ACT ON RETURNS ISSUES ESPECIALLY IN THIS ELECTION YEAR. 
 
...BUT OSCE/EU WAVERING 
------------------------ 
 
15. (C) THAT SAID, GOC PUSH BACK FOLLOWING THE IC PRINCIPALS 
JANUARY 23 LETTER TO PM RACAN SUSPENDING PARTICIPATING IN THE 
JOINT LEGAL WORKING GROUP IS HAVING AN IMPACT.  OSCE HOM 
SEMNEBY WAS QUICK, AND AT PAINS, TO PUT OUT A BEST-CASE 
LAUDATORY PRESS RELEASE ON CACIC\'S ANNOUNCED OCCUPANCY AND 
TENANCY RIGHTS PLAN.  SEMNEBY ALSO PULLED EVERY CONCEIVABLE 
PUNCH IN AN EXCESSIVELY POSITIVE BRIEFING ON THESE ISSUES TO 
THE EU WESTERN BALKANS WORKING GROUP (COWEB) IN BRUSSELS 
FEBRUARY 6.  YET AGAIN IN AN IC PANEL BRIEFING FOR A VISITING 
OSCE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION FEBRUARY 10, SEMNEBY TOOK A 
NOTABLY SOFTER LINE ON THE GOC THAN DID UNHCR, THE UN LIAISON 
OFFICE OR OUR OWN EMBASSY PARTICIPANT.  IT IS CLEAR TO US AND 
TO SEMNEBY\'S AMERICAN DEPUTY HOM (PROTECT) THAT SEMNEBY IS 
GETTING COLD FEET OUT OF FEAR THAT THE OSCE-GOC RELATIONSHIP 
WILL SOUR AND HE WILL END UP COLD-SHOULDERED AND VILIFIED 
LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR BERNARD PONCET.  THAT COULD HAPPEN, BUT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00337  03 OF 04  121721Z 
IF SO IT WOULD BE OF LIMITED IMPORT FOR REAL IC INTERESTS 
HERE.  THE OSCE MISSION IS LIKE UNMOVIC -- IF THE HOST 
COUNTRY REJECTS AND OBSTRUCTS PEOPLE WHO CAN ONLY HELP IT 
RESOLVE ISSUES OF INTERNATIONAL CONCERN, BUT NOT ENFORCE, ITS 
VALUE DISAPPEARS AND IT COULD AS EASILY GO AWAY.  WE ARE 
CONVEYING TO THE OSCE MISSION AND TO SEMNEBY THAT WHILE WE 
WANT THEM TO TRY TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE GOC, 
THEY WILL NOT HAVE OUR SUPPORT IF THEY LOSE FOCUS AND 
SACRIFICE BASIC PRINCIPLES IN THE PROCESS. 
 
16. (C) OF PERHAPS MORE CONCERN ARE INDICATIONS THAT EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION PRESSURE ALSO PEAKED LAST MONTH WITH THEIR ACTIVE 
SUPPORT FOR SUSPENDING THE JOINT LEGAL WORKING GROUP. THE 
COMMISSION DEPUTY HEAD JOINED SEMNEBY IN SOFT-PEDALING 
CRITICISM OF THE GOC AT THE OSCE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION 
BRIEFING.  THE COMMISSION AND OSCE MISSIONS INCREASINGLY LINK 
THEIR WORK AND OPERATE IN TANDEM; FOR EXAMPLE, SEMNEBY AND 
THE COMMISSION DEPUTY MET TOGETHER WITH CACIC THE WEEK BEFORE 
HIS PUBLIC BRIEFING, AND THE TWO INVARIABLY LINK THEIR 
MANDATES AND POLICY AGENDAS IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
HERE IN ZAGREB.  TALKING TO MOST EU AMBASSADORS HERE, WE FIND 
A BROAD MAJORITY CRITICAL OF GOC PERFORMANCE BUT NOT EAGER TO 
DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD OBSTRUCT HANDLING OF CROATIA\'S 
IMMINENT EU APPLICATION IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN THE NORMAL 
MANNER.  THE GERMANS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE AUSTRIANS ARE 
APOLOGISTS FOR THE GOC; THE BRITISH AND DUTCH ANCHOR THE

ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RETURNS AND A KEY RACAN AIDE ARE ALL 
REPORTED TO BE ARGUING FOR THE GOC TO SHUT OUT MEANINGFUL IC 
DIALOGUE AND GO ITS OWN WAY.  THE RACAN AIDE MADE IT CLEAR 
BOTH TO SEMNEBY AND THE AMBASSADOR THAT RACAN WILL NOT ENGAGE 
ON IC CONCERNS ANYTIME SOON, IF EVER.  RACAN IS NO LEADER; 
THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ANTI-COOPERATION 
CONSTELLATION WILL PREVAIL ABSENT CONSTANT AND STRONG IC 
PRESSURE.  WE WILL WORK TO REINFORCE THE PRESSURE HERE.  WE 
URGE THAT THE USG PRESS THIS ISSUE IN BRUSSELS AND IN EU AND 
NATO CAPITALS WHENEVER CROATIA IS ON THE AGENDA.  UNLESS WE 
PRESS THE GOC HARD AND CONSTANTLY, WE WILL NOT GET THE 
FORCEFUL GOC ACTION NEEDED TO GET SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF 
RETURNEES HOME, EVER.

PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00338  121756Z 
ON FEBRUARY 5, IT HAS DONE LITTLE SINCE THEN TO SHAPE THE 
PUBLIC DEBATE AND NOTHING TO DESCRIBE THE THREAT POSED BY 
SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  THE AMBASSADOR 
HAS GIVEN A SERIES OF ON-THE-RECORD INTERVIEWS AND THE 
EMBASSY HAS PRACTICALLY FORCE-FED BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON 
THE THREAT POSED BY IRAQ TO ALL LOCAL MEDIA.  NEVERTHELESS, 
THE DEBATE IN ZAGREB\'S POLITICAL CIRCLES IS NOW FOCUSED 
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON WHETHER OR NOT FM PICULA SHOULD HAVE 
SIGNED THE V-10 STATEMENT AND HOW CROATIA\'S BID FOR EU 
MEMBERSHIP WILL BE AFFECTED BY ITS POSITION ON IRAQ. 
 
2. (C) PUBLIC OPINION, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY DOMESTIC 
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE, IS RUNNING STRONG AGAINST 
MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ WITHOUT A NEW UNSC RESOLUTION.  A 
FEBRUARY 10 POLL CONDUCTED BY CROATIA\'S MOST RELIABLE AGENCY 
SHOWS THAT MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC IS AGAINST 
MILITARY ACTION.  AT A FEBRUARY 12 PRESS CONFERENCE, PM RACAN 
BACKED AWAY FROM THE V-10 STATEMENT, CALLING IT \"IMPRECISE 
AND OPEN TO INTERPRETATION,\" UNDERSCORING THAT IN SIGNING THE 
STATEMENT, THE GOC UNDERTOOK NO NEW OBLIGATIONS TO SUPPORT 
USG EFFORTS AGAINST IRAQ. 
 
3.  (C) RACAN SEEKS TO MAKE A CLEAR DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN 
CROATIA\'S COMMITMENT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WAR AGAINST 
TERRORISM AND ANY POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO EFFORTS IN IRAQ. 
ON FEBRUARY 11, RACAN REVIEWED THE MP PLATOON WHICH WILL 
DEPLOY TO KABUL IN SUPPORT OF ISAF BY THE END OF FEBRUARY. 
AT THE FEBRUARY 12 PRESS CONFERENCE, HE REITERATED CROATIA\'S 
SUPPORT FOR THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  BUT HE SAID THAT HIS 
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN NO DECISIONS ON HOW CROATIA MIGHT 
CONTRIBUTE TO EFFORTS IN IRAQ.  RACAN SAID THAT ANY DECISION 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00338  121756Z 
TO CONTRIBUTE TO MILITARY EFFORTS AGAINST IRAQ WOULD HAVE TO 
BE TAKEN BY THE CABINET, IN ACCORDANCE WITH CROATIA\'S LAWS 
AND CONSTITUTION, AND THEN ONLY AFTER WEIGHING ALL ARGUMENTS, 
INCLUDING PUBLIC OPINION.  \"CROATIA ADVOCATES A PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION,\" SAID RACAN, AND ADDED THAT THE \"POSITION OF THE 
CROATIAN PUBLIC IS UNDERSTANDABLE,\" GIVEN CROATIA\'S RECENT 
EXPERIENCE IN WAR. 
 
4.  (C) RACAN -- NOT A DYNAMIC LEADER AT THE BEST OF TIMES -- 
IS TRYING TO KEEP HIS COALITION TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH TO 
SUBMIT CROATIA\'S APPLICATION TO THE EU BEFORE LIMPING TO 
EARLY ELECTIONS (REFTEL).  WE WILL CONTINUE TO URGE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS -- AND THE LOCAL PRESS -- TO STAY 
FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUE AT HAND: DISARMING SADDAM 
HUSSEIN.  WITHOUT A CLEAR SIGNAL FROM THE EU OR NATO, RACAN\'S 
GOVERNMENT WILL LIKELY STAY ON THE FENCE.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) CROATIA\'S INITIAL SUPPORT FOR THE USG POSITION ON 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00347  01 OF 02  131644Z 
IRAQ IS WAVERING UNDER PRESSURE FROM EU COUNTRIES AS THE GOC 
PREPARES TO PRESENT ITS APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP. 
PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST ACTION IN IRAQ WITHOUT NEW UNSC 
SANCTION IS ALSO A STRONG FACTOR AS PM RACAN TRIES TO KEEP A 
SHAKY COALITION TOGETHER.  ON FEBRUARY 13, ONE DAY AFTER PM 
RACAN CALLED THE RECENT VILNIUS-10 STATEMENT \"OPEN TO 
INTERPRETATION,\" THE AMBASSADOR DELIVERED A STRONG MESSAGE TO 
THE FOREIGN MINISTRY: THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT HOW THE EU 
INTERPRETS CROATIA\'S STATEMENTS, BUT HOW THE WORLD REMOVES 
THE THREAT OF SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
LATER ON FEBRUARY 13 (BUT INDEPENDENT OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S 
MESSAGE), PM RACAN RELEASED A MORE APPROPRIATE STATEMENT (SEE 
TEXT AT PARA 9 BELOW) CALLING FOR FULL IRAQI COMPLIANCE WITH 
UNSCR 1441 TOGETHER WITH AN APPEAL FOR A UNIFIED POSITION 
WITHIN THE EU AND BETWEEN THE EU AND THE USG.  IT SEEMS CLEAR 
TO US THAT THE GOC BELIEVES THAT SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE 
READY TO HOLD CROATIA\'S EU APPLICATION HOSTAGE TO GOC 
BEHAVIOR ON IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 12, PM RACAN TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE 
FEBRUARY 5 STATEMENT SIGNED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ALL 
\"VILNIUS 10\" COUNTRIES WAS \"IMPRECISE ... AND OPEN TO 
INTERPRETATION\" (REFTEL).  ABSENT CLEAR LEADERSHIP, THE 
PUBLIC DEBATE IN CROATIA HAS FOCUSED NOT ON THE THREAT POSED 
BY SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S REGIME AND ITS WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION, BUT ON WHETHER OR NOT FM PICULA SHOULD HAVE 
SIGNED THE V-10 STATEMENT AND HOW CROATIA\'S BID FOR EU 
MEMBERSHIP WILL BE AFFECTED BY ITS POSITION ON IRAQ. 
 
3.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 13, THE AMBASSADOR SOUGHT AN EARLY 
MEETING WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY TO GET THE GOC TO REFOCUS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00347  01 OF 02  131644Z 
ITS ENERGY ON THE MORE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS ISSUE.  WITH 
ASSISTANT FOREIGN MINISTER NOBILO, HE PRESSED FOR THE GOC TO 
\"GET OFF THE FENCE;\" PM RACAN\'S STATEMENT ON FEBRUARY 12 WAS 
EQUIVOCAL AND LOOKED LIKE CROATIA WAS BACKING AWAY FROM THE 
V-10 STATEMENT.  WHAT WAS CROATIA\'S POLICY, ANYWAY? 
 
4.  (C) NOBILO SAID THAT CROATIA IS NOT BACKING AWAY FROM THE 
V-10 STATEMENT, BUT IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PERCEPTION IN 
THE PUBLIC AND IN POLITICAL CIRCLES THAT THE GOC WAS HURRIED 
INTO SIGNING THE STATEMENT AND HAD MADE A BINDING COMMITMENT 
TO SUPPORT MILITARY ACTION.  HE APPEALED TO THE AMBASSADOR 
FOR \"PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING\" AS THE GOC IS IN A DELICATE 
SITUATION.  THE GOC IS IN THE FINAL STAGES OF SUBMITTING ITS 
APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP; THE REACTION OF THE EU COULD 
HAVE POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE CURRENT COALITION 
GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS ALREADY ON SHAKY GROUND IN AN ELECTION 
YEAR.  NOBILO SAID THAT THE GOC POSITION WOULD BE \"CLARIFIED\" 
BY A STATEMENT TO BE RELEASED LATER IN THE DAY FOLLOWING A 
CABINET MEETING THEN UNDERWAY. 
 
5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR SAID WE WOULD LOOK AT THE STATEMENT 
CAREFULLY AND WOULD BE BACK IN TOUCH, BUT WARNED THAT THE 
ABSENCE OF FORTHRIGHT GOC LEADERSHIP ON THE REAL ISSUE AT 
STAKE -- DISARMING SADDAM -- IS ALLOWING THE PUBLIC DEBATE TO 
GET OFF TRACK.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED; THIS 
IS ONE OF THE TIMES IN HISTORY WHEN NATIONS MUST TAKE A 
STAND; CROATIA TOOK A STRONG STAND WHEN IT SIGNED UP TO THE 
V-10 STATEMENT; NOW IT WAS WEAKENING. 
 
6.  (C) NOBILO WAS EXPLICIT ABOUT EU PRESSURE, EXPLAINING 
THAT THE GOC IS UNDER HEAVY PRESSURE FROM \"OPPONENTS\" OF THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00347  01 OF 02  131644Z 
U.S. ON IRAQ (HE DID EVERYTHING BUT SAY FRANCE AND GERMANY BY 
NAME).  THE \"BIG\" EU STATES HAVE WARNED THEM THAT THE 
\"INCOMING COUNTRIES ARE BEING PERCEIVED AS TROUBLEMAKERS\" AND 
SAID THAT CROATIA MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO HURT PROSPECTS FOR 
ITS APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, WHICH IT PLANS TO SUBMIT 
NEXT WEEK.  NOBILO SAID THAT THE STATEMENT WOULD NOT WEAKEN 
THE V-10\'S CALL FOR IRAQ TO DISARM, BUT WOULD ALSO MAKE A 
PLEA FOR UNITY WITHIN THE EU AND A UNIFIED POSITION ON IRAQ 
THROUGHOUT THE NORTH ATLANTIC COMMUNITY. 
 
7.  (C) NOBILO REPEATED HIS PLEA FOR PATIENCE; HE EXPECTS 
THAT AFTER THE NEXT BLIX REPORT TO THE UNSC, THE EU COUNCIL 
OF MINISTERS MEETING NEXT WEEK AND CROATIA\'S SUBMISSION OF 
ITS APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, THE GOC WILL BE MORE 
RESPONSIVE.  THE AMBASSADOR WARNED THAT CROATIA NEEDS TO MAKE 
UP ITS OWN MIND; THE LACK OF EU UNITY WOULD CERTAINLY 
CONTINUE PAST NEXT MONDAY; THE TIME FOR ACTION WAS SHORT. 
 
8.  (C) THE STATEMENT AS RELEASED AFTER THE FEBRUARY 13 
CABINET MEETING SEEMS TO REPRESENT ACCURATELY THE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT\'S MUDDLED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT.  IT 
CALLS FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1441 AND DECLARES THAT 
IRAQI BEHAVIOR WILL DETERMINE \"WHETHER THIS CRISIS WILL END

PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00347  02 OF 02  131645Z 
 
GOC POSITION ON IRAQI CRISIS 
 
CROATIA IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION 
AND HAS SINCE ITS CREATION SOUGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS 
EFFECTIVENESS ACCORDING TO ITS OWN ABILITIES, ESPECIALLY 
WITHIN OUR REGION.  THROUGHOUT THE YEARS CROATIAN DIPLOMACY 
HAS CONSISTENTLY AND ACTIVELY WORKED ON BANNING, CONTROLLING 
AND DESTROYING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
 
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS CROATIA HAS CLEARLY CALLED ON IRAQ TO 
COOPERATE FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WITH UN INSPECTORS AND TO 
COMPLY WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS FROM UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE PERTAINING TO THE 
IDENTIFICATION AND DESTRUCTION OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION.  CROATIA HAS ITS INSPECTORS IN THE UN TEAM AND 
HAS IN THAT MANNER AND OTHERWISE SOUGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THIS CRISIS. 
 
CONSISTENT WITH THAT POLICY AND BASED ON ITS FULL SUPPORT TO 
UNSC RESOLUTION 1441, CROATIA HAS JOINED IN A NUMBER OF 
INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE 
IRAQI CRISIS. THE STATEMENT SIGNED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTERS 
OF THE VILNIUS GROUP COUNTRIES CONSTITUTES A FORM OF 
ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON IRAQ TO COMPLY WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS 
REGARDING COOPERATION WITH UN INSPECTORS AND DESTRUCTION OF 
THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, WHICH WAS CROATIA\'S PRIMARY 
MOTIVE WHEN JOINING THE STATEMENT IN SOLIDARITY. 
 
AS A NATO CANDIDATE AND A COUNTRY SCHEDULED TO APPLY FOR EU 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMING DAYS, CROATIA IS PARTICULARLY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00347  02 OF 02  131645Z 
INTERESTED IN SEEING THE STRENGTHENING OF JOINT EU POLICIES 
ON FOREIGN AND SECURITY MATTERS.  THAT IS WHY CROATIA JOINED 
THE FEBRUARY 4 EU PRESIDENCY DEMARCHE ON IRAQ.  CROATIA 
THEREFORE HOPES THAT THE UPCOMING EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF 
THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL WILL RESULT IN A MUCH-NEEDED CONSENSUS 
ON WAYS TO RESOLVE THE IRAQI CRISIS.  WE ARE EQUALLY 
INTERESTED IN THE PRESERVATION AND SOLIDIFICATION OF THE 
POLITICAL UNITY AND TOGETHERNESS OF THE EURO-ATLANTIC REGION. 
 STABLE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE E.U. AND THE U.S. - I.E. WITHIN 
THE EURO-ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP - IS THE BEST GUARANTEE OF 
PEACE AND STABILITY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER, BUT ALSO FOR 
EFFECTIVE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM.  EURO-ATLANTIC DIALOGUE 
IS ALSO NEEDED IN ORDER TO EXAMINE AND CONTROL ALL POSSIBLE 
ASPECTS OF RESOLVING THE IRAQI CRISIS. 
 
CITIZENS OF CROATIA HIGHLY VALUE PEACE AND PEACEFUL POLITICAL 
MEANS FOR RESOLVING PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THEY KNOW VERY WELL 
ABOUT THE HORRORS OF WAR AND DESTRUCTION.  THAT\'S WHY CROATIA 
IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN RESOLVING THE CRISIS WITHOUT 
WAR.  STANDING ON ITS PRINCIPLES OF PLEADING FOR WAR AND 
STABILITY IN THE WORLD, AS WELL AS FOR THE UNDISPUTABLE ROLE 
OF THE U.N., CROATIA CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT NOT ALL MEANS 
FOR PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE IRAQI CRISIS HAVE BEEN 
EXHAUSTED. THE GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA WARNS THAT IT DEPENDS ON 
IRAQI BEHAVIOR WHETHER THIS CRISIS WILL END IN PEACE OR WAR. 
THAT IS WHY WE ARE ONCE AGAIN CALLING ON IRAQ TO FULLY AND 
IMMEDIATELY COMPLY WITH U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 
1441.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE EXPRESS BELIEF THAT EVERY 
POSSIBLE MEANS OF RESOLVING THIS CRISIS MUST BE ASSESSED WITH 
REGARD TO WHETHER IT EXPANDS OR NARROWS THE GROUNDS OF 
TERRORISM.  TAKING ALL THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00347  02 OF 02  131645Z

AGREED THAT THEY WERE BUSY ADJUSTING TO THE VERY AMBITIOUS 
COMMITMENTS THEY HAD TAKEN ON AND WERE NOT READY TO MOVE

AMONG THE MOST OPEN COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, IN TERMS OF ITS 
COMPLETE BINDING OF TARIFF LEVELS.  ITS AVERAGE BOUND RATE 
TARIFFS LEVEL FOR NON-AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WAS 5 PERCENT, 
WITH OVER 99 PERCENT OF ITS TARIFFS BOUND BELOW OR AT 14 
PERCENT.  IT WAS TIME FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD TO CATCH UP 
WITH CROATIA.  SHE ALSO NOTED THAT MOST OF CROATIA\'S 
NEIGHBORS, ASIDE FROM SLOVAKIA AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC, HAD 
HIGHER TARIFFS.  WHILE SHE RECOGNIZED THE MANY BENEFITS THAT 
LOWER TARIFFS HAD BROUGHT CROATIA (WHICH IS EXPERIENCING A 
CREDIT AND CONSUMER-LED BOOMLET), THERE WAS ALSO A CONCERN 
ABOUT BALLOONING TRADE DEFICITS.

--------------- 
 
2.  AS THEY HAD ANNOUNCED, SOME THIRTY CROATIAN NGO\'S 
STAGED ON FEBRUARY 15 ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS IN DOWNTOWN 
ZAGREB UNDER THE SLOGAN \"ENOUGH OF WARS!\"  SMALL PROTEST 
RALLIES -- RANGING FROM A FEW DOZEN TO A FEW HUNDRED 
PARTICIPANTS -- WERE ALSO HELD IN OTHER CROATIAN CITIES AND 
TOWNS INCLUDING SPLIT, OSIJEK, PULA, ZADAR, DUBROVNIK, 
VUKOVAR AND KNIN.  WHILE THE FOCUS WAS ON U.S. IRAQ POLICY, 
PETITIONS WERE SIGNED IN ZAGREB AND PULA DEMANDING THAT 
CROATIA NOT JOIN NATO. 
 
3.  ALTHOUGH ALL LOCAL MEDIA REPORTED THAT AN ESTIMATED 
10,000 PROTESTERS GATHERED IN ZAGREB, THE POLICE TOLD US 
THAT THE NUMBER WAS BETWEEN 1,500 AND 2,000 PEOPLE.  THE 
RALLY STARTED AT THE MAIN SQUARE IN DOWNTOWN ZAGREB WHERE 
HALF A DOZEN INTELLECTUALS AND ARTISTS ADDRESSED THE CROWD. 
THE MOST PROMINENT SPEAKER WAS FORMER SCIENCE AND ARTS 
ACADEMY PRESIDENT IVAN SUPEK WHO CALLED FOR MOTHERHOOD AND 
APPLE PIE VIRTUES SUCH AS UNIVERSAL DISARMAMENT AND A WORLD 
COMMUNITY BASED ON SOLIDARITY AND PEACE.  OTHERS CALLED ON 
THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT TO DO A U-TURN AND DISASSOCIATE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00367  210153Z 
ITSELF FROM THE VILNIUS GROUP DECLARATION. 
 
4.  DEMONSTRATORS CARRIED BANNERS WITH FAMILIAR SLOGANS: 
\"IRAQ IS NOT ONLY SADDAM, U.S. IS NOT ONLY BUSH\"...\"FOOD, 
NOT ARMS\"...\"TERROR IS NOT AN ANSWER TO TERROR\"...\"NO BLOOD 
FOR OIL\"...\"POLITICIANS TO THE TRENCHES\"...\"NOT IN OUR 
NAME.\"  THE RALLIES IN ZAGREB AND OTHER CITIES WERE 
ATTENDED BY A NUMBER OF POLITICAL FIGURES INCLUDING FORMER 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE JOZO RADOS (AND CURRENT MEMBER OF THE 
COALITION), ITALIAN MINORITY REPRESENTATIVE FURIO RADIN, 
SDP\'S MP PAVLE KALINIC, AND GOVERNOR OF ISTRIA IVAN 
JAKOVCIC (IDS). 
 
5.   THE ONLY INCIDENT DURING THE RALLY WE SAW IN FRONT OF 
THE EMBASSY -- WHICH WAS GUARDED BY SOME 150 POLICE 
OFFICERS -- WAS THE BURNING OF A U.S. FLAG \"ADORNED\" WITH 
SWASTIKAS BY A GROUP OF ABOUT TWENTY INDIVIDUALS WHO 
IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS \"ANARCHISTS OF THE ANTI-FASCIST 
ACTION,\" A GROUP WHOSE NAME SOUNDS EQUALLY ABSURD IN THE 
ORIGINAL CROATIAN.  AFTER LESS THAN AN HOUR OF 
DEMONSTRATIONS IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY, PROTESTERS RETURNED 
TO THE MAIN SQUARE TO SIGN PETITIONS AND DANCE TO MUSIC. 
 
6.   BELGRADE MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ONLY 50 MILES FROM ZAGREB, THE MUNICIPALITY OF VOJNIC 
STANDS AS A STARK EXAMPLE OF THE ECONOMIC REALITIES FACED BY 
CROATS, SERBS, AND MUSLIMS ALIKE IN CROATIA\'S WAR AFFECTED 
REGIONS -- RURAL COMMUNITIES LONG PLAGUED BY ECONOMIC DECLINE 
AND OUT MIGRATION.  THE EFFECTS OF THE 1991-1995 \"HOMELAND\" 
WAR, PARTICULARLY THE POPULATION SHIFTS AND DESTRUCTION OF 
PROPERTY, EXACERBATED AN ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION IN 
VOJNIC.  THE ARRIVAL OF NEARLY 2,000 BOSNIAN CROAT SETTLERS 
-- WHO BOOSTED THE CROAT PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION FROM 
ONE TO OVER 36 PERCENT -- HAS ADDED TO THE PROBLEMS. 
 
2. (C) FEW ECONOMIC PROSPECTS EXIST APART FROM SMALL SCALE 
AGRICULTURE.  THERE ARE CURRENTLY 370 WAGE PAYING JOBS IN A 
REGION WITH OVER 8,000 INHABITANTS, AND THE LARGEST EMPLOYER 
IS REPORTED TO BE NEARLY BANKRUPT.  MUSLIMS ARE THE HARDEST 
HIT, WITH NEARLY FULL UNEMPLOYMENT.  RETURN OF PROPERTY 
REMAINS THE BIGGEST ISSUES FOR SERBS; OVER 500 SERB-OWNED 
HOUSES REMAIN OCCUPIED, PRIMARILY BY BOSNIAN CROAT SETTLERS. 
NO EVICTIONS HAVE BEEN ENFORCED TO DATE.  EVEN IF THERE WERE 
A COORDINATED AND COMPREHENSIVE GOVERNMENT POLICY TO ADDRESS 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES -- AND THERE IS NONE -- IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO ENVISION THE REGION EVER BEING VIABLE 
ECONOMICALLY.

---------- 
 
3. (U) THE MUNICIPALITY OF VOJNIC IS JUST 50 MILES SOUTHEAST 
OF ZAGREB, BUT IS ANOTHER WORLD WHEN ONE COMPARES THE LIVING 
STANDARDS -- ONE ALMOST FIRST WORLD, THE OTHER VERY MUCH 
BACKWARD.  HILLY, ISOLATED, HUGGING THE BOSNIAN BORDER, 
VOJNIC REMINDS AN AMERICAN VISITOR QUICKLY OF THE HOLLOWS OF 
WEST VIRGINIA.  VOJNIC WAS A PART OF THE SERB CONTROLLED 
KRAJINA FROM 1991-1995, AND WAS RETAKEN BY CROATIAN 
AUTHORITIES IN AUGUST 1995 UNDER OPERATION \"STORM.\" 
 
4. (U) THE PRE-WAR POPULATION WAS JUST OVER 8,000, DIVIDED 
AMONG 46 VILLAGES -- 89 PERCENT SERB, 10 PERCENT MUSLIM, AND 
ONLY ONE PERCENT CROAT.  INHABITANTS WERE FULLY \"EMPLOYED\" IN 
THE SOCIALIST SENSE; MOST RESIDENTS WERE ENGAGED IN 
AGRICULTURE, TIED IN WITH THE LARGE AGROKOMBINAT \"AGROKOMERC\" 
LOCATED JUST OVER THE BORDER IN WHAT IS NOW BOSNIA (AND OWNED 
BY FIKRET ABDIC, FORMER REGIONAL WARLORD, AND NOW A CONVICTED 
WAR CRIMINAL).  WHAT LITTLE INDUSTRY EXISTED -- A FACTORY FOR 
CLAY EXPLOITATION, CERAMICS, SAWMILL, IRON AND STEEL WORKS -- 
WAS OUTDATED AND UNDERCAPITALIZED EVEN BEFORE THE WAR. 
 
THE ECONOMY TODAY 
----------------- 
 
5. (C) AGRICULTURE REMAINS THE PREDOMINATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, 
ALTHOUGH ONLY 30 PERCENT OF ARABLE LAND IS BEING CULTIVATED 
COMPARED TO NEARLY 100 PERCENT IN 1990.  VOJNIC\'S CATTLE 
POPULATION IS JUST ONE-FIFTH ITS PRE-WAR LEVEL.  LACK OF 
FINANCIAL RESOURCES HAS LIMITED THE RECONSTRUCTION OF FARM 
BUILDINGS, WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR PRODUCTION TO INCREASE. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00376  01 OF 04  200658Z 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND GOVERNMENT FINANCING HAS BEEN 
USED TO RECONSTRUCT HOUSES, BUT ONCE THE HOUSE IS HABITABLE 
RESIDENTS HAVE LITTLE ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR OTHER PURPOSES. 
FOR EXAMPLE, THE MINISTRY OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES AND 
CRAFTS, LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AND UNDP, HAVE CO-FINANCED A LOAN 
GUARANTEE FUND THAT NOW OPERATES IN EIGHT TOWNS.  BANKS ARE 
ENCOURAGED BY THE GUARANTEE FUND TO LEND TO INDIVIDUALS WHO 
WANT TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESS.  AS PART OF THE SERVICE 
PROVIDED, THE FUND WILL DEVELOP FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND ACT 
AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE BANKS AND THE BORROWER, 
PROVIDING ADVICE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. 
 
6.  (C) SOME CHARGE DISCRIMINATION AT THE FUND.  AN EMPLOYEE 
OF THE FUND TOLD US THAT, WHILE IT MAKES APPROXIMATELY TWO 
HUNDRED LOANS A YEAR, ONLY ONE HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR A SERB 
RETURNEE.  THE COLLATERAL THIS APPLICANT WAS REQUIRED TO 
SUBMIT INCLUDED -- BUT WAS NOT LIMITED TO -- HIS HOUSE, AND A 
PROMISSORY NOTE IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $71,000.  HE 
HAD TO GET A PERSON EMPLOYED BY A GOVERNMENT ENTITY TO 
CO-SIGN THE LOAN AS A CO-GUARANTOR.  THE LATER REQUIREMENT, 
NOT UNCOMMON FOR BANKS IN CROATIA, EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATES THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A RETURNEE GETTING A LOAN.  WITHOUT THE 
LIMITED ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
-- TO BUY A COW OR PIG, REPAIR THE SHELTER, AND BUY OTHER 
SMALL SCALE AGRICULTURAL INPUTS -- MOST RETURNEES SAY THEY 
WOULD NOT HAVE COME BACK.

6. (C) SALARIED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN VOJNIC ARE FEW 
AND FAR BETWEEN.  IN THE ENTIRE MUNICIPALITY, ONLY 370 
RESIDENTS ARE FORMALLY EMPLOYED, WHILE AROUND 800 ARE 
REGISTERED AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT BUREAU.  AND ACCORDING TO THE 
MAYOR, THE VOJNIC FORESTRY FIRM, THE MUNICIPALITY\'S LARGEST 
EMPLOYER WITH 70 EMPLOYEES, IS FACING BANKRUPTCY.  THE OTHER 
LEADING EMPLOYERS ARE A CERAMIC FACTORY (40 EMPLOYEES), A 
SAWMILL (20 EMPLOYEES), A CLOTHING ENTERPRISE (20 EMPLOYEES), 
AND A FACTORY FOR PLASTIC PRODUCTS (15 EMPLOYEES). 
 
MUSLIM COMMUNITY 
---------------- 
 
7. (C) THE MUSLIMS OF VOJNIC ARE STRONG CONTENDERS FOR THE 
MOST DISADVANTAGED OF THE REGION.  ACCORDING TO IMAM DJURMIC, 
THE LEADER OF THE LOCAL MUSLIM COMMUNITY, UNEMPLOYMENT VERGES 
ON 95 PERCENT, ILLITERACY IS 80 PERCENT, AND THERE ARE NO 
PROSPECTS FOR EMPLOYMENT.  IN OUR DISCUSSION, HIS COMMENTS 
WERE OFTEN HYPERBOLIC, AND HIS NUMBERS WERE OFTEN AT ODDS 
WITH OTHER KNOWN FACTS -- GIVING CREDENCE TO THE ADAGE THAT 
42.7 PERCENT OF ALL STATISTICS ARE MADE UP ON THE SPOT -- BUT 
DJURMIC PAINTED A GENERALLY ACCURATE PICTURE.  THE TWO 
BIGGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE REGION, THE SAWMILL AND CERAMIC 
WORKS, HE CLAIMED, EMPLOY NOT A SINGLE MUSLIM.  SEVERAL 
COMMUNITIES ARE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.  IN THE FIGHT BETWEEN 
CROATS AND SERBS, MUSLIM HOMES WERE LARGELY LEFT INTACT, AND 
SO EMPLOYMENT, RATHER THAN PROPERTY, IS THE MAIN ISSUE 
CONFRONTING THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. 
 
8. (C) DESPITE DJURMIC\'S GRIM PICTURE, THE MUNICIPALITY\'S 
MUSLIM POPULATION APPEARS TO BE INCREASING.  MUSLIM LEADERS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00376  02 OF 04  200658Z 
CLAIM THERE ARE 1,600 MUSLIMS IN THE REGION, WHILE THE 2001 
CENSUS ACKNOWLEDGES ONLY 768, OR 14 PERCENT OF THE 
POPULATION.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL OFFICIALS, 1,350 MUSLIMS ARE 
REGISTERED IN THE MUNICIPALITY.  MANY HAVE BOTH BOSNIAN AND 
CROATIAN CITIZENSHIP, AND WORK IN BOSNIA.  THE PRE-WAR 
PATTERN OF LIVING IN CROATIA AND WORKING IN BOSNIA WAS 
UNREMARKABLE WHEN ALL WERE CITIZENS OF YUGOSLAVIA; BUT NOW, 
DUE IN PART TO MISSED DEADLINES, AND ALSO TO WAR AND 
OCCUPATION, SOME MUSLIMS WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN BORN IN 
CROATIA BUT HAVE LIVED HERE \"FOREVER\" ARE EXPERIENCING 
DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING CITIZENSHIP AND OTHER DOCUMENTS 
NECESSARY FOR RECEIVING RETIREMENT AND/OR SOCIAL BENEFITS. 
ONE SERB RETURNEE, POINTING OUT HIS WINDOW TO THE LARGE NEW 
HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET, TOLD US THAT MUSLIMS FROM BOSNIA ARE 
BUYING UP BOTH HOUSES AND PROPERTY IN THE REGION IN THE HOPE 
THAT IT WILL HELP THEM GET RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS. 
 
9. (C) POLITICALLY, THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY IS BEING COURTED BY 
BOTH THE CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION (HDZ), ON THE RIGHT, AND 
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP), ON THE LEFT.  IN A UNIQUE 
TURN OF EVENTS WHICH BEGAN LAST FALL WHEN THREE SDP 
REPRESENTATIVES RESIGNED FROM THE PARTY AND BECAME 
INDEPENDENT, THE VOJNIC MUNICIPAL COUNCIL WAS FORMALLY 
DISSOLVED IN JANUARY.  THE GOC APPOINTED A CARETAKER 
\"COMMISSIONER,\" AN INDEPENDENT JUDGE FROM NEARBY KARLOVAC, TO 
RUN THE MUNICIPALITY UNTIL BY-ELECTIONS, WHICH MUST BE HELD 
BY MID-APRIL.  ONE RESULT OF THE ENSUING POLITICAL VACUUM WAS 
THAT USAID\'S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (MOU) WITH THE 
MUNICIPALITY LAPSED.  WITH SUCCESS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE 
POLITICAL WILL AND COOPERATIVENESS OF THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL, 
USAID WAS RELUCTANT TO EXTEND THE MOU PRIOR TO A BY-ELECTION. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SERB RETURNEES 
-------------- 
 
10. (C) REPOSSESSION OF PROPERTY REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO RETURN.  ACCORDING TO USAID SOURCES, 
BY LATE 2002 OWNERS HAD SUBMITTED 385 REQUESTS FOR RETURN OF 
PROPERTY.  OVER 600 PRIVATELY OWNED HOUSES AND 66 APARTMENTS 
WERE DAMAGED IN THE WAR.  AT THE END OF 2002, APPROXIMATELY 
300 REQUESTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION ASSISTANCE WERE STILL 
PENDING.  AS A RESULT OF THE WAR AND ENSUING OBSTACLES TO 
RETURN, THE SERB POPULATION HAS BEEN REDUCED TO APPROXIMATELY 
ONE THIRD ITS PRE-WAR LEVEL -- FROM OVER 7,000 TO UNDER 3,000 
INHABITANTS. 
 
11. (C) DRAGAN VUCKOVIC, 57, REPRESENTS A TYPICAL SERB 
RETURNEE IN THE VOJNIC AREA.  THE HEAD OF AN EXTENDED FAMILY 
OF FOUR, WITH ONE CHILD, VUCKOVIC RETURNED TO HIS RESIDENCE 
\"SPONTANEOUSLY\" (THAT IS, WITHOUT GOVERNMENT OR NGO 
ASSISTANCE) IN 2001.  HIS HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN OCCUPIED, BUT 
WAS DAMAGED IN THE WAR.  ALL FARM-RELATED EQUIPMENT AND 
SUPPLIES WERE LOST.  PRIOR TO THE WAR HE WAS A RELATIVELY 
PROSPEROUS FARMER, MANAGING 18 HECTARES AND A HERD OF CATTLE. 
 OFF FARM EMPLOYMENT WAS AVAILABLE, PROVIDING A CUSHION TO 
SOFTEN THE VAGARIES OF AN AGRICULTURAL EXISTENCE.  NOW,

THE VUCKOVIC FAMILY RETURNED TO CROATIA WITH NO IMMEDIATE 
PROSPECT OUTSIDE THE PROMISE OF INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND 
A MONTHLY PENSION OF APPROXIMATELY $55. 
 
12. (C) THANKS TO PRM PROGRAMS, VUCKOVIC RECEIVED ASSISTANCE 
FOR SHELTER REPAIR AND FOR AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT.  USAID 
PROVIDED A SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE LOAN, WHICH WAS USED 
TO BUY FOUR DAIRY COWS.  WITHOUT THIS ASSISTANCE VUCKOVIC 
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETURN.  WITH HIS FEW COWS AND 
SMALL MILK COOLER AND THE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE OF A 
USAID-FUNDED NGO AND THE VINDIJA AND KIM COMPANIES, WHICH 
HAVE ORGANIZED MILK COLLECTION FOR THE REGION, VUCKOVIC HAS 
INCREASED HIS INCOME TO NEARLY $300 PER MONTH.  HE IS 
INCREASING HIS HERD AND TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO REPAIR FARM 
BUILDINGS.  ALTHOUGH HE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO, HE IS GLAD TO 
BE BACK IN HIS HOUSE, REPORTS GOOD RELATIONS WITH LOCAL 
CROATS, AND IS PLANNING FOR A BETTER FUTURE. 
 
BOSNIAN CROAT SETTLERS 
---------------------- 
 
13. (C) OVER 500 BOSNIAN CROAT FAMILIES FROM NORTHWESTERN 
BOSNIA ARE ACCOMMODATED IN SERB-OWNED HOUSES IN THE 
MUNICIPALITY.  SOME WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO BOSNIA, BUT 
EITHER CANNOT OR ARE UNWILLING, GIVEN HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, OR 
SOCIAL PROBLEMS THEY WOULD ENCOUNTER IN BOSNIA.  EMPLOYMENT 
IS NOT THE PRIMARY ISSUE FOR SETTLERS -- THEY HAVE OBTAINED 
STATE AND STATE SUPPORTED JOBS, AND FACE ECONOMIC PROSPECTS 
LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OF THE AVERAGE CROATIAN IN THE 
REGION.  HOUSING IS THE BIG ISSUE.  BOSNIAN CROATS RECOGNIZE 
THEY ARE VIEWED AS A PART OF THE PROBLEM, AND WHILE THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00376  03 OF 04  200659Z 
MAJORITY WANTS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE RAPIDLY, THEY ARE NOT 
GOING TO VACATE HOUSES WHEN THEY HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO GO. 
IN ADDITION, THEY ARE NOT INCLINED TO LET THIS GOVERNMENT OFF 
THE HOOK FOR PROMISES (HOUSING, JOBS, ETC.) MADE BY THE HDZ 
GOVERNMENT TO INDUCE THEM TO SETTLE IN CROATIA. 
 
14. (C) ONE BOSNIAN CROAT LEADER AFFILIATED WITH THE 
ASSOCIATION OF CROATIAN SETTLERS, WHICH CLAIMS TO SPEAK FOR 
APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT OF SETTLERS, HAS SAID THAT 
COMMUNICATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT CONSISTS OF BOSNIAN CROATS 
BEING TOLD \"YOU MUST...\" FOLLOWED BY \"SOMETHING BAD.\" 
CONSERVATIVE POLITICALLY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF BOSNIAN CROATS 
REMAIN SUPPORTIVE OF THE NOW OPPOSITION CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC 
UNION (HDZ) PARTY OF FORMER PRESIDENT FRANJO TUDJMAN. IN A 
SENSE THEY REPRESENT AN UNWANTED CASTE -- ALL BUT ABANDONED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR ETHNIC \"HOMELAND,\" SCORNED BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE OBSTACLE THEY 
REPRESENT TO THE RETURN PROCESS, DIFFERENT FROM THEIR NEW 
CROATIAN CROAT NEIGHBORS BOTH CULTURALLY AND SOCIALLY, AND OF 
COURSE, DESPISED BY THE SERBS WHOSE HOMES THEY OCCUPY. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
15. (C) VOJNIC IS NEITHER ALONE NOR SPECIAL IN ITS 
PREDICAMENT; IT IS ONE OF MANY MARGINAL RURAL AREAS THAT WERE 
IN DECLINE WELL BEFORE THE WAR, WHICH SERVED TO HASTEN AND 
COMPLICATE AN ALREADY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT FOR 
DEVELOPMENT.  THE BORDER AREAS OF THE KRAJINA, LIKE THOSE OF 
THE DALMATIAN HINTERLANDS, POSE A SERIOUS ECONOMIC CHALLENGE 
FOR CROATIA.  THE WAR ACCELERATED WHAT OTHERWISE WAS A LONG, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00376  03 OF 04  200659Z 
SEEMINGLY INEVITABLE DECLINE.  SOME REGIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, BY 
1990 HAD DECLINED TO LESS THAN HALF THEIR PRE-WORLD WAR II 
POPULATIONS.  AND PART OF WHAT KEPT THE REGION VIABLE DURING 
TITO TIMES WAS THE FINANCIAL BOOST PROVIDED BY MILITARY BASES 
AND FACILITIES -- AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS NO LONGER PROVIDED. 
 
16. (C) THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT\'S CHALLENGE IS DAUNTING. 
ACCORDING TO UNDP, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEITHER A POLICY NOR 
ANY IDEA WHAT TO DO.  WE SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR A GOVERNMENT 
INTERLOCUTOR WHO IS TASKED EITHER TO WORK ON ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES GENERALLY, OR SPECIFICALLY ON WAR-AFFECTED 
AREAS.  THE JULY 2002 AMENDMENTS TO THE LAW ON AREAS OF 
SPECIAL STATE CONCERN (THE SO-CALLED WAR AFFECTED AREAS) 
IMPLICITLY RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO KEEP 
BUILDING AND RECONSTRUCTING HOUSES WHEN THERE ARE NO 
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND A COMMISSION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
ESTABLISHED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
ISSUES.  TO DATE, IN WHAT IS A PATTERN FOR THIS GOVERNMENT, 
THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTION TAKEN.  THE FACT REMAINS THAT NO 
MATTER HOW WELL THE RETURN PROCESS MAY SUCCEED, IN THE END 
NEITHER THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NOR THE GOVERNMENT ARE 
LIKELY TO HAVE SUFFICIENT SWAY OVER ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO 
REVERSE THE DECADES OF DECLINE IN VOJNIC AND THE KRAJINA.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) A FEBRUARY 18 JOINT SESSION OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEES OF THE CROATIAN 
PARLIAMENT FAILED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY LINE ON 
IRAQ.  PREDICTABLY, THE FAILURE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IRAQ, 
BUT WITH THE COALITION\'S INCOMPETENCE AND THE OPPOSITION\'S 
OPPORTUNISM.  SINCE THE SESSION PRODUCED NO CONCRETE RESULT, 
PARLIAMENT SPEAKER ZLATKO TOMCIC WILL LIKELY CALL FOR A 
BROADER DEBATE OF THE GOC IRAQ POLICY DURING THE NEXT PLENARY 
SESSION OF THE SABOR, WHICH MAY TURN OUT TO BE EVEN MORE 
DISRUPTIVE.  WHILE PM RACAN AND SOME OTHERS (INCLUDING WE) 
TRY TO STEER THE DEBATE IN CROATIA TO SADDAM AND IRAQ, MOST 
OF THE POLITICAL CHATTERING CLASS HERE CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON 
HOW THE GOC\'S POLICY STATEMENTS ON IRAQ WILL AFFECT CROATIA\'S 
APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP AND ON VARIOUS POLITICAL 
PARTIES\' FORTUNES IN AN ELECTION YEAR. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) THE GOC DECISION TO JOIN THE VILNIUS-10 DECLARATION 
OF SUPPORT TO THE USG INTERPRETATION OF IRAQ\'S NONCOMPLIANCE 
WITH UNSCR 1441 TOOK MOST OF CROATIA\'S POLITICAL LEADERS BY 
SURPRISE.  WHILE MESIC TOOK THE CABINET\'S ABRUPT POLICY 
CHOICE MORE OR LESS IN HIS STRIDE, THE PARLIAMENT (SABOR) GOT 
ITS NOSE OUT OF JOINT.  INSISTING ON ITS CONSTITUTIONAL 
PREROGATIVE AS CROATIA\'S SUPREME POLITICAL BODY, THE SABOR 
SCHEDULED A JOINT SESSION OF THE COMMITTEES ON NATIONAL 
SECURITY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS (REFTEL).  THE MEETING WAS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00393  01 OF 02  211406Z 
DELAYED A WEEK AS THE PM WAS BUSY ABROAD DRUMMING UP SUPPORT 
FOR CROATIA\'S EU BID, BUT IT FINALLY CONVENED IN CLOSED (BUT 
VERY LEAKY) SESSION ON FEBRUARY 18.  IN ADVANCE OF THE 
MEETING, THE EMBASSY PROVIDED BOTH COMMITTEES TRANSLATIONS OF 
SECRETARY POWELL\'S FEBRUARY 5 INTERVENTION AT THE UN SECURITY 
 
SIPDIS 
COUNCIL AND SEVERAL OTHER SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS. 
 
3.  (C) AS THE COALITION HOLDS A SLIM MAJORITY IN BOTH 
COMMITTEES, THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A 
FOREGONE CONCLUSION.  ANTE MARKOV (HSS), CHAIRMAN OF THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE, MADE SURE OF ALL OF HIS VOTES 
WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE MEETING (WE HAD ADMONISHED HIM NOT TO 
PLAY POLITICS ON IRAQ - REFTEL). 
 
4.  (C) ZDRAVKO TOMAC, WHO CHAIRS THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
COMMITTEE AND IS A MEMBER OF PM RACAN\'S SDP, FAILED TO ENSURE 
THAT ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF HIS COMMITTEE WHO ARE ON THE 
COALITION WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING.  TOMAC HAS BEEN A 
RIGHT-WING, KNOW-IT-ALL IRRITANT TO RACAN WITHIN THE SDP 
SINCE THE COALITION CAME TO POWER IN 2000, BUT THE PM -- WHO 
IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE SDP -- HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO 
BRING HIM INTO LINE.  IN THE RUNUP TO THIS JOINT COMMITTEE 
SESSION, TOMAC THREATENED TO QUIT THE SDP (AFTER HIS SISTER 
WAS FIRED FROM HER POSITION AS ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR 
VETERANS AFFAIRS). 
 
5.  (C) THE OPPOSITION HDZ, WHICH REMAINS LARGELY 
UNRECONSTRUCTED FROM THE CORRUPT, NATIONALIST DAYS OF 
PRESIDENT TUDJMAN, HAS TAKEN A STRONG POSITION IN SUPPORT OF 
USG EFFORTS ON IRAQ.  BUT WITHOUT ALL OF THE COALITION 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESENT, THE OPPOSITION COULD NOT PASS UP 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00393  01 OF 02  211406Z 
THE CHANCE TO DELIVER A POLITICAL DEFEAT TO PM RACAN.  THE 
OPPOSITION ABSTAINED FROM THE COMMITTEE VOTE, WHICH MEANT 
THAT WITH TWO FRINGE-PARTY VOTES AGAINST AND TWO COALITION 
VOTES PLAYING HOOKY, THE COMMITTEE DID NOT SUPPORT THE GOC 
POSITION. 
 
5.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 19 POST-MORTEM MEETING, OPPOSITION MP 
AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE MEMBER VESNA SKARE-OZBOLT 
SHEEPISHLY ADMITTED TO US THAT THE ONLY REASON THE HDZ AND 
HER PARTY, THE RIGHT-OF-CENTER DEMOCRATIC CENTER (DC), VOTED 
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT POSITION WAS ELECTION-YEAR POLITICS. 
THE DECISION TO ABSTAIN WAS MADE ON THE DAY OF THE COMMITTEE 
MEETING, WHEN HDZ PRESIDENT SANADER COUNTED NOSES AND SAW 
THAT THE COALITION WOULD LOSE WITHOUT THEM.  THE HDZ, WHICH 
IS DESPERATE TO GET THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (AND 
ESPECIALLY THE USG) TO GIVE ITS SEAL OF APPROVAL TO ITS 
FAR-FROM-COMPLETE INTERNAL REFORM PROCESS, PHONED POLOFF 
AFTER THE VOTE TO TRY AND REASSURE US THAT THE HDZ POSITION 
ON IRAQ REMAINS STAUNCHLY PRO-USG.  THE HDZ ISSUED A PRESS 
RELEASE THE FOLLOWING DAY WITH THE SAME MESSAGE, BUT ADDING A 
LINE ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT IT IS NOT THE OPPOSITION\'S 
RESPONSIBILITY TO DELIVER THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY.

6.  (C) NO FOLLOW-UP MEETING TO THE JOINT SESSION HAS BEEN 
SCHEDULED, BUT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT PARLIAMENT SPEAKER ZLATKO 
TOMCIC (HSS) WILL LET THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY CHOICE STAND 
WITHOUT THE SABOR MARKING ITS TERRITORY.  RIGHT NOW, THE 
COALITION PARTIES HAVE SUSPENDED THEIR DIFFERENCES IN ORDER 
TO PRESENT A UNITED FRONT AS CROATIA SUBMITS ITS APPLICATION 
TO THE EUROPEAN UNION (SIGNED ON FEBRUARY 20 AND SCHEDULED 
FOR DELIVERY IN ATHENS ON FEBRUARY 21).  BUT IT WON\'T BE LONG 
BEFORE THE BELL RINGS TO SIGNAL THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT 
ROUND, AND IRAQ WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE HOTTEST POLITICAL 
POTATO IN ZAGREB.  DESPITE POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS OUTSIDE OF 
CROATIA, POLITICIANS HERE WILL USE THIS ISSUE TO GAIN 
ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR OPPONENTS IN THIS ELECTION YEAR.

PENINSULA, MONTENEGRIN BORDER AREAS 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. WHILE THE GOC WILL COVER THE FULL COST OF DEMINING THE 
PREVLAKA PENINSULA, IT IS SEEKING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00407  01 OF 02  241640Z 
DEMINING AREAS ON BOTH SIDES OF ITS BORDER WITH MONTENEGRO. 
CROATIAN AUTHORITIES WANT TO BE ABLE TO TOUT PREVLAKA AS A 
MAJOR TOURIST ATTACTION THIS SUMMER, AND SEE DEMINING AS A 
KEY PART OF THIS EFFORT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GOC HAS BIG PLANS FOR PREVLAKA 
------------------------------ 
 
2. AT THE INVITATION OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE CROATIAN MINE 
ACTION CENTER (CROMAC), OTO JUNGWIRTH, WE TRAVELED ON 
FEBRUARY 13 TO PREVLAKA AND OTHER AREAS ALONG THE CROATIAN 
BORDER WITH MONTENEGRO TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANING OF THE 
SCOPE OF THE MINE PROBLEM IN THE AREA.  UNTIL RECENTLY, THE 
PENINSULA HAD BEEN OFF LIMITS, PART OF AN EXCLUSION ZONE OF 
THE UN OBSERVER MISSION (UNMOP), WHICH SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS 
IN DECEMBER.  CROATIAN AND MONTENEGRIN AUTHORITIES DESCRIBED 
TO US EXTENSIVE COOPERATION THEY HAVE HAD ON A NUMBER OF 
ISSUES THEY BOTH FACE IN DEVELOPING THE REGION POST UNMOP. 
 
3.  BEFORE TRAVELING TO PREVLAKA, WE MET WITH HDZ MEMBER AND 
COUNTY PREFECT OF DUBROVNIK, IVAN SPRLJE, WHO HAS POLITICAL 
AUTHORITY OVER PREVLAKA.  SPRLJE TOLD US THAT PLANS WERE 
ALREADY UNDERWAY TO ESTABLISH PREVLAKA AS A MAJOR TOURIST 
ATTRACTION.  HE SAID THAT ONE ASPECT OF THE PLAN IS TO 
CONVERT A HUGE PORTION OF THE PENISULA INTO A CAMP AREA FOR 
TOURISTS.  IN ADDITION, THE GOC WILL BUILD AN INTERNATIONAL 
STUDENT CENTER ON PREVLAKA, WHICH WOULD BE THE LARGEST IN THE 
REGION.  ALL OF THE FACILITIES WILL BE FOR PUBLIC USE AND 
WOULD BE OPEN YEAR ROUND.  SINCE IT IS A STATE PROJECT, MUCH 
OF THE FUNDING FOR DEMINING AND OTHER CONSTRUCTION WILL COME 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00407  01 OF 02  241640Z 
FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  THE GOC HAS ALREADY ALLOCATED 
OVER $2 MILLION FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS AND WORK HAS ALREADY 
BEGUN TO ENHANCE ROADS AND WATER SUPPLY -- A LONGSTANDING 
CONSTRAINT -- TO THE PENINSULA. 
 
4.  SPRLJE SAID THE NUMBER OF MONTENEGRIN TOURISTS TO 
DUBROVNIK WAS UP CONSIDERABLY SINCE UNMOP SHUT DOWN.  HIS 
ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE POPULATION IN THE AREAS NEAR 
THE BORDER WITH MONTENEGRO.  HE SPECULATED THAT MORE PEOPLE 
WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO THOSE AREAS ONCE GOOD RELATIONS HAVE 
BEEN ESTABLISHED AMONG THE COMMUNITIES STRADDLING THE BORDER 
AND THE LANDMINES HAVE BEEN REMOVED.  CURRENTLY, NO ONE WAS 
LIVING ON PREVLAKA OR IN THE AREAS NEAR THE BORDER.  ONE MINE 
INCIDENT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BORDER COULD CAUSE RELATIONS 
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES TO NOSE DIVE.  SPRLJE VOICED HIS 
APPRECIATION FOR U.S. INTEREST IN THE REGION AND POSSIBLE 
WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO DEMINING EFFORTS. 
 
EYEING THE TOURIST SEASON 
------------------------- 
 
5. ACCESS TO PREVLAKA IS RESTRICTED BY THE CROATIAN POLICE, 
PER AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE TWO SIDES WHEN UNMOP\'S CLOSURE 
WAS BEING DISCUSSED.  DEMINING EFFORTS, HOWEVER, ARE ALREADY 
UNDERWAY.  CROMAC OFFICIALS TOLD US THAT THE PENINSULA 
CONSISTED OF ALMOST ONE MILLION SQUARE METERS OF LAND, ALL OF 
WHICH HAD TO BE EXAMINED FOR MINES.  SO FAR, ONE-THIRD OF THE 
LAND HAD BEEN CLEARED.  THEY SPECULATED THAT THE REMAINING 
AREAS WILL BE COMPLETED BY JUNE.  THE GOC WANTED TO SPEED UP 
THE INTEGRATION OF THE PENINSULA AS PART OF CROATIAN 
TERRITORY AND TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS STABILITY ON ITS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00407  01 OF 02  241640Z 
SOUTHERN FLANK.  ALSO, THE GOC IS SEEKING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OF THE UPCOMING TOURIST SEASON BY HAVING PREVLAKA OPEN TO 
TOURISTS IN JULY. 
 
6. CROATIAN AND MONTENEGRIN AUTHORITIES ARE COOPERATING IN 
IDENTIFICATION OF SUSPECTED MINE SITES NEAR THE BORDER.  SO 
FAR THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THREE AREAS AND HAVE DEVELOPED JOINT 
DEMINING PROJECTS FOR EACH OF THEM.  ONE AREA IS ON THE 
OUTSKIRTS OF PREVLAKA, WHILE THE OTHER TWO AREAS ARE ON THE 
MONTENEGRIN SIDE OF THE BORDER.  EACH PROJECT CONSISTS OF 
ABOUT 100,000 SQUARE METERS.  ONCE THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN 
COMPLETED, AUTHORITIES TOLD US, THE ENTIRE AREA STRADDLING 
THE BORDER WILL BE MINE FREE.  THE CROATIAN AND MONTENEGRIN 
GOVERNMENTS ARE SEEKING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP 
FINANCE THE PROJECTS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  RELATIONS BETWEEN MONTENEGRINS AND CROATIANS, BITTER FOR 
OVER A DECADE, ARE ON THE MEND, AND COOPERATION ON DEMINING 
HAS HELPED IMPROVE THE CLIMATE EVEN FURTHER.  WHILE ON THIS 
VISIT THERE WAS NO FORMAL PITCH FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT, 
WE WILL SEEK TO LEND OUR SUPPORT IN THIS EFFORT WHERE 
POSSIBLE.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE ROSSIN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B.D) 
 
1.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 26, THE CROATIAN CABINET PASSED A FORMAL 
DECISION (TEXT AT PARA 5 BELOW) TO AGREE TO A USG REQUEST FOR 
THE USE OF CROATIAN AIRSPACE AND AIRFIELDS BY COMMERCIAL 
AIRCRAFT FOR REFUELING AND STOPOVER IN SUPPORT OF MILITARY 
OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AGAINST IRAQ.  THE DECISION 
CREATES AN INTER-AGENCY WORKING GROUP, TO BE CHAIRED BY AN 
ASSISTANT MINISTER OF DEFENSE, WHICH WILL IMPLEMENT AND 
MONITOR ACTIVITIES UNDER THE DECISION.  ALTHOUGH THE DECISION 
GOES INTO EFFECT ON FEBRUARY 26, IT MAY TAKE AS LONG AS TWO 
WEEKS FOR THE WORKING GROUP TO BE FORMALLY ESTABLISHED; 
CROATIA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR 
FLIGHTS UNTIL THAT TAKES PLACE. 
 
2.  (C) THIS DECISION WAS PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT 
PRECISELY AS PM RACAN TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON FEBRUARY 24 IT 
WOULD BE (REFTEL).  AT THE SABOR\'S VERSION OF \"QUESTION TIME\" 
ON FEBRUARY 26, RACAN TOLD MP\'S THAT THE DECISION WAS TAKEN 
\"WITH THE UNDERSTANDING\" OF EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS WHICH ARE 
DECIDING ON CROATIA\'S EU MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION.  RACAN ALSO 
SAID THAT CROATIA\'S OFFER OF LOGISTICS SUPPORT WAS A 
MINIMALIST POSITION.  \"SOME COUNTRIES WHICH ARE AGAINST THE 
APPROACH OF THE UNITED STATES ARE PROVIDING MORE LOGISTICS 
SUPPORT THAN WE ARE OFFERING,\" RACAN EXPLAINED.  RACAN 
INSISTED THAT THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT IS WITHIN 
THE COMPETENCE OF THE CABINET, BUT ANY REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL 
SUPPORT WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT, AS REQUIRED BY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00428  01 OF 02  261352Z 
CROATIAN LAW. 
 
3.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 25 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, 
PRESIDENT MESIC WAS MORE SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. POLICIES/REQUESTS 
ON IRAQ THAN WE EXPECTED, CONSIDERING SOME OF HIS RECENT 
STATEMENTS TO THE LOCAL PRESS.  MESIC SAID THAT HE SUPPORTS 
THE GOC DECISION TO AGREE TO THE USG REQUEST FOR LANDING 
RIGHTS IN CROATIA.  HE SAID THAT HE RAISED THE ISSUE DURING 
HIS JANUARY 24 MEETING IN PARIS WITH PRESIDENT CHIRAC, WHO 
CHARACTERIZED CROATIA\'S DECISION TO PROVIDE FLOW-THROUGH 
ACCESS AS APPROPRIATE. 
 
4.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 25 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, DEFMIN 
ANTUNOVIC SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECISION WOULD APPROVE OUR 
REQUEST WITH VERY NARROW PARAMETERS; ANY REQUEST BEYOND 
AIRSPACE, LANDING AND REFUELING WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN TO THE 
PARLIAMENT.  CROATIA\'S DEFENSE LAW REQUIRES SABOR APPROVAL 
BEFORE THE ENTRY OF ANY FOREIGN TROOPS INTO CROATIA.  THE GOC 
INTERPRETATION IS THAT THE SABOR WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE IN 
ADVANCE -- WITH A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY -- IF A U.S. SOLDIER IS 
TO SET FOOT ON CROATIAN SOIL.  UNDER THE CURRENT DECISION, 
TROOPS WILL HAVE TO REMAIN ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT DURING 
REFUELING.  IN THE CASE OF AN AIRCRAFT BREAKDOWN, THE GOC 
COULD OFFER OVERNIGHT STAYS WITHOUT OVERSTEPPING ITS LEGAL 
BOUNDARIES.  SUCH A CASE WOULD BE DECLARED AN EMERGENCY STOP 
UNDER ICAO RULES AND THE GOC WOULD BE LEGALLY COVERED.

BASED ON THE ARTICLE 30 SECTION 2 OF THE LAW ON THE REPUBLIC 
OF CROATIA (OFFICIAL GAZETTE, NO 101/98, 15/200 AND 
117/2001), GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA AT ITS SESSION ON 26 
FEBRUARY 2003, REACHED THE FOLLOWING 
 
DECISION  ON THE USE OF AIRSPACE AND AIRPORTS OF THE REPUBLIC 
OF CROATIA FOR THE NEEDS OF COALITION FORCES LED BY THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
 
I.  BASED ON REPUBLIC OF CROATIA\'S DETERMINATION TO COMBAT 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND PREVENT PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS 
OF MASS DESTRUCTION, REPEATEDLY DECLARED BY CROATIA\'S 
GOVERNMENT, PARLIAMENT AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, 
CROATIA\'S GOVERNMENT WILL WITHIN ITS ABILITY, MEET THE 
REQUEST TO EXTEND ITS SERVICES TO COALITION FORCES LED BY THE 
UNITED STATES IN CONDUCTING OPERATIONS AIMED AT DISARMING 
IRAQ, AS IT IS DETERMINED IN UN SECURITY RESOLUTION 1441. 
 
II.  IN EVENT THAT THERE IS A REQUEST AS STATED IN THE ITEM I 
OF THIS DECISION, CROATIAN GOVERNMENT APPROVES THE USE OF 
CROATIA\'S AIRSPACE FOR OVER-FLIGHTS, LANDING AND REFUELING 
CIVIL TRANSPORTATION AIRCRAFT AT CROATIAN AIRPORTS.

SUBJECT: CROATIA APPLIES FOR EU MEMBERSHIP 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: PRIME MINISTER RACAN SUBMITTED CROATIA\'S 
OFFICIAL APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP ON FEBRUARY 21 IN 
ATHENS.  CROATIA\'S STATUS AS A CANDIDATE COULD BE CONFIRMED 
WITHIN A YEAR\'S TIME, THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION MINISTER 
SAID.  REFUGEE RETURNS, COOPERATION WITH THE WAR CRIMES 
TRIBUNAL (ICTY), AND REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SECTOR ARE 
MAJOR CHALLENGES ON THE EU PATH.  THE GOC BELIEVES THAT 
CROATIA COULD BE READY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU BY THE END 
OF 2006.  THE PROCESS LEADING UP TO THE APPLICATION, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00432  271601Z 
INCLUDING AN EXTENSIVE GOC LOBBYING TOUR AND BROAD NON- 
PARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE PARLIAMENT, SHOWS THE GREAT 
IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE FOR CROATIANS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  PRIME MINISTER IVICA RACAN OFFICIALLY SUBMITTED 
CROATIA\'S APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 
TO THE GREEK PM AND CURRENT EU CHAIR, COSTAS SIMITIS, ON 
FEBRARY 21 IN ATHENS.  THIS ONE-PAGE DOCUMENT -- WHICH 
COMES IN PACKAGE WITH A PROMOTIONAL CD TITLED \"REMEMBER 
CROATIA\" -- WAS CO-SIGNED BY RACAN AND PRESIDENT STJEPAN 
MESIC.  AT THE OFFICIAL PRESENTATION IN ATHENS, RACAN 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CROATIA WAS COMMITTED TO BUILDING A TRULY 
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, THE RULE OF LAW AND AN EFFICIENT 
ECONOMY -- ADDING, HOWEVER, THAT THE SERBIAN \"AGGRESSION\" 
AND ITS CONSEQUENCES HAD SLOWED CROATIA ON THAT PATH. 
RACAN ALSO RECALLED THAT CROATIA\'S AMBITION TO JOIN THE EU 
HAD WON ACROSS-THE-BOARD SUPPORT FROM EU MEMBERS DURING HIS 
GOVERNMENT\'S LOBBYING TOUR PRECEEDING THE APPLICATION. 
 
OPTIMISTIC? 
----------- 
 
3.  GENERALLY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO CONVEY OPTIMISM 
ABOUT ITS EU ASPIRATIONS, ALTHOUGH THE IRAQ CRISIS HAS CAST 
A CLOUD OVER ITS EFFORTS.  PM RACAN PRIVATELY TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR FEBRUARY 24 THAT THE EU APPLICANT STATUS OF 
CROATIA MADE ITS POSITION VIS-A-VIS IRAQ \"TWICE AS DELICATE 
AS THAT OF BULGARIA AND ROMANIA WHICH IN TURN WERE IN A 
SITUATION TWICE AS DELICATE AS THOSE OF OTHER CANDIDATES.\" 
MORE BROADLY, AUTHORITIES HAVE TOLD US THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED AND PROGRESS IS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00432  271601Z 
STEADY.  MIRJANA MLADINEO, THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF EUROPEAN 
INTEGRATION, REMINDED US OF HER PREDICTION OF OVER A YEAR 
AGO.  SHE WAS VERY SATISFIED THAT CROATIA\'S APPLICATION 
PROCESS HAD PROCEEDED ACCORDING TO PLAN.  HER MINISTRY HAD 
ADDED TALENTED STAFF AND WAS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LINE 
MINISTRIES.  EUROPEAN INTEGRATION MINISTRY OFFICIALS 
ENJOYED GOOD COOPERATION WITH COUNTERPARTS IN COUNTRIES 
AHEAD OF CROATIA IN THE ACCESSION PROCESS, INCLUDING 
HUNGARY AND SLOVENIA, AND BEHIND THEM, INCLUDING SERBIA AND 
MONTENEGRO. 
 
4.  TALKING TO THE PRESS ON FEBRUARY 25 IN ZAGREB, EUROPEAN 
INTEGRATION MINISTER NEVEN MIMICA SAID CROATIA COULD BE 
READY TO BECOME AN EU MEMBER BY THE END OF 2006 -- A GOAL 
MOST OBSERVERS CONSIDER HIGHLY OPTIMISTIC IF NOT DOWN RIGHT 
IMPLAUSIBLE.  HE EXPECTED CROATIA TO SECURE CANDIDATE 
STATUS WITHIN A YEAR, AFTER THE EC HAS STATED ITS OPINION 
ON THE APPLICATION.  IN THE MEANTIME, MIMICA EXPECTS THAT 
CROATIA WILL COMPLETE ALL THE TERMS OF THE STABILIZATION 
AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT WITH THE EU (SAA) NEXT YEAR. 
WHILE PREDICTING THAT THE IRAQ CRISIS WOULD NOT 
SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE PACE OF CROATIAN ACCESSION, MIMICA 
IDENTIFIED THE RETURN OF REFUGEES, COOPERATION WITH THE 
HAGUE TRIBUNAL (ICTY) AND THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY AS 
THE THREE MAIN CHALLENGES ON CROATIA\'S PATH TO THE EU AND 
NATO.  MOST OBSERVERS AGREE THAT EU MEMBERSHIP ENJOYS WIDE 
SUPPORT IN CROATIA, WITH ONLY FRINGE FIGURES ON THE RIGHT 
OPPOSING IT.

5.  THE POLITICAL IMPORTANCE OF GETTING ON THE ROAD TO EU 
MEMBERSHIP COULD BE UNDERSCORED BY THE UNPRECEDENTED 
LOBBYING EFFORT THAT THE PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER, FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND OTHERS PERSONALLY ENGAGED IN DURING THE MONTHS 
LEADING UP TO THE APPLICATION.  FEW DOUBT THAT THE GOC HAS 
SO FAR BEEN NAVIGATING THE EASY WATERS.  THE COMING PERIOD 
WILL BE DIFFERENT; SUBSTANCE MUST REPLACE PROCESS.  THE 
GOVERNMENT MUST WORK ON AN ASSORTMENT OF REQUIREMENTS TO 
HARMONIZE DOMESTIC LAWS WITH EU LAWS, TO MOVE TO COMPLY 
WITH INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE WAR 
CRIMES TRIBUNAL AND THE RETURN OF REFUGEES.  THE LIST OF 
RESPONSIBILITIES IS LONG -- AND GOC EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE 
BEEN MIXED AT BEST AND NON-EXISTENT AT WORST.  WHILE THE 
EUROPEAN INTEGRATION MINISTRY HAS MANY TALENTED PEOPLE, IT 
IS IN THE LINE MINISTRIES -- JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR -- WHERE 
THE HEAVY LIFTING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE BEFORE CROATIA 
ENTERS THE UNION.  WE DOUBT MANY DIFFICULT REFORMS WILL BE 
ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S AGENDA BEFORE CROATIAN ELECTIONS, WHICH 
MUST BE HELD BY SPRING NEXT YEAR.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.   (C) THE RACAN GOVERNMENT IS DIGGING IN ITS HEELS ON THE 
SUCCESSION AGREEMENT, AND MAY WELL IGNORE OUR REQUEST FOR A 
HOLD HARMLESS BEFORE THE USG UNBLOCKS DISPUTED NBY ASSETS 
THIS SPRING.  THAT IS THE INDICATION WE RECEIVED IN SEPARATE 
MEETINGS WITH THE GOC\'S REPRESENTATIVE ON THE FINANCIAL 
COMMITTEE OF THE SUCCESSOR STATES AND THE TOP LEGAL ADVISOR 
AT THE MFA.  THE AMBASSADOR PLANS TO DELIVER DEMARCHE (REF A) 
TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE CROATIANS 
TOLD US THAT THE MEETING OF THE SUCCESSOR STATES\' FINANCIAL 
EXPERTS ON FEBRUARY 13 UNDERSCORED THAT THE GOC\'S HARD LINE HAD 
WIDE SUPPORT.  THEY CLAIMED OTHER SUCCESSOR STATES NOW WISH THEY 
HAD NOT RATIFIED THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT (ASI) SIGNED IN 
VIENNA IN JUNE 2001.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   (C) WE SPOKE TO ZDRAVKO ROGIC, DEPUTY GOVERNOR AT 
CROATIA\'S NATIONAL BANK, ON FEBRUARY 25 AND ANDREJA 
METELKO-ZGOMBIC, HEAD OF THE MFA\'S LEGAL AFFAIRS OFFICE, ON 
FEBRUARY 26 CONCERNING USG PLANS TO UNBLOCK DISPUTED SFRY 
ASSETS.  THEY BOTH INDICATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00450  01 OF 02  281911Z 
CONSIDERED OUR REQUEST FOR A HOLD HARMLESS PRIOR TO THE 
UNBLOCKING OF NBY ASSETS IN THE SPRING AND HAD CONCLUDED THAT 
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, EVEN IF THIS MEANS CROATIA COULD LOSE OVER 
$50 MILLION.  BOTH INDICATED THAT IT WAS A MATTER OF 
\"PRINCIPLE.\"  ROGIC, WHO REPRESENTS CROATIA ON THE JOINT 
FINANCIAL COMMITTEE OF THE SUCCESSOR STATES, SAID A HOLD 
HARMLESS AGREEMENT ABSENT RATIFICATION OF THE SUCCESSION 
AGREEMENT WOULD REPRESENT A \"USURPATION OF LEGISLATIVE 
PREROGATIVE.\"  METELKO-ZGOMBIC ECHOED HIM LATER. 
 
BAD FAITH IN VIENNA 
------------------- 
 
3.  (C) BOTH REPEATED THEIR WELL KNOWN VIEW OF WHAT HAPPENED 
IN VIENNA.  IT COMES DOWN TO BAD FAITH BEING SHOWN BY 
BELGRADE AUTHORITIES AT THE TALKS.  FOR THE GOC TO SECURE 
PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OF THE AGREEMENT NOW THE AGREEMENT 
WOULD HAVE TO BE REVISED.  ROGIC SAID AT THE VERY LEAST THIS 
WOULD INVOLVE AMENDING THE INCORRECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
DEPOSITS IN THE NBY JOINT VENTURE BANKS BEFORE THE CROATIAN 
PARLIAMENT TAKES UP THE MATTER.  HE CONCEDED THAT ANY EFFORT 
TO OBTAIN COMPENSATION FOR THE \"MISSING\" MONEY WAS PROBABLY 
\"OUT OF THE QUESTION.\"  WHILE UPSET WITH THE FRY NEGOTIATORS 
IN VIENNA, HE WAS ALSO QUICK TO CRITICIZE THE CROATIAN TEAM. 
HE ALL BUT CALLED THE GOC\'S TOP NEGOTIATOR, BOZO MARENDIC, 
INCOMPETENT.  HE SAID THE OTHER NEGOTIATORS IN VIENNA, EXCEPT 
POSSIBLY THE SLOVENES, HAD LITTLE BANKING EXPERTISE AND WERE 
PROBABLY HOODWINKED TOO. 
 
4.   (C) ROGIC ACKNOWLEDGED THAT \"DEPOSITS\" DID NOT EQUAL 
RECOVERABLE ASSETS.  WHEN ASKED IF THE GOC WAS INDULGING IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00450  01 OF 02  281911Z 
SEMANTICS, HE SAID NO.  \"IT\'S POLITICS.\"  UNLIKE ASSETS WHICH 
CAN BE ERODED BY BAD MANAGEMENT, HE CONTINUED, DEPOSITS CAN 
ONLY BE DECREASED BY TRANSFERS.  THE NBY, HE STRESSED, SHOULD 
HAVE RECORDS OF THOSE TRANSFERS AND PRODUCE THEM.  WHEN WE 
TOLD HIM THAT OFAC DECIDED NOT TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION OF 
THE NBY ACCOUNTS, ROGIC EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT.  HE NOTED 
THAT THE U.S. PARTICIPANTS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN VIENNA 
AND SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY IN THE NBY 
ACCOUNTS NOW.  HE IMPLIED THAT THE ONLY PARTICIPANTS WHO KNEW 
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN VIENNA WERE THE AMERICANS, THE SERBS, 
AND POSSIBLY THE SLOVENES. 
 
UNFAIR KEY? 
----------- 
 
5.   (C) AT THE MFA, METELKO-ZGOMBIC TOOK AN EVEN TOUGHER 
LINE.  FIRST, SHE SAID THE ASI NEEDED TO BE RATIFIED.  THE 
DEAL STRUCK IN VIENNA WAS BASED ON A LIE -- THAT THERE WAS 
OVER $600 MILLION IN JOINT VENTURE BANK ACCOUNTS TO BE 
DISPERSED TO THE SUCCESSORS WHEN NO SUCH MONEY EXISTED. 
BASED ON THE FALSE INFORMATION -- AND THE FALSE PROSPECT THAT 
CROATIA STOOD TO GAIN OVER $200 MILLION WHEN THE MONEY WAS 
DISTRIBUTED -- CROATIA HAD ACCEPTED A PROBLEMATIC KEY. 
CROATIA WOULD RECEIVE ONLY 23 PERCENT OF THE SFRY\'S ASSETS,

WHILE IT ASSUMED 28.5 PERCENT OF THE SFRY\'S DEBT. 
METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID THAT THIS ASYMMETRY WAS UNFAIR WHEN THE 
DEAL WAS STRUCK, BUT COULD BE SWALLOWED GIVEN THE MONEY 
CROATIA STOOD TO GAIN.  AFTER ALMOST $545 MILLION TURNED UP 
MISSING, SHE ARGUED, THIS RENDERED THE ASYMMETRY IN THE KEY 
UNACCEPTABLE. 
 
LEGAL ROAD 
---------- 
 
6.  (C) THE LEGAL ADVISOR, WHOSE POSITION HAS REMAINED 
BASICALLY UNCHANGED IN THE ALMOST SIX MONTHS SINCE WE HAVE 
BEEN DISCUSSING THE ISSUE, OUTLINED WHAT LEGAL COURSE THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS TAKING.  SHE EMPHASIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
WAS PREPARED TO FIGHT THE OFAC UNBLOCKING INITIATIVES IN U.S. 
COURTS.  ON THE PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN PROPERTY THAT WERE 
UNBLOCKED ON FEBRUARY 25, IT WAS TRUE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD 
NOT SOUGHT AN INJUNCTION IN COURT, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE 
TAKEN AS INDICATION THAT THE GOC WAS ROLLING OVER.  THE GOC 
STILL ASSERTS THAT $40 MILLION OF THE $102 MILLION THAT WAS 
UNBLOCKED BELONGED TO THE SFRY AND SHOULD BE DISPERSED TO ALL 
THE SUCCESSORS.  TOGETHER WITH OTHER SUCCESSOR STATES AND 
THEIR U.S. LAWYERS, THE INSTITUTIONS HOLDING THESE ASSETS 
HAVE BEEN APPROACHED.  THE INSTITUTIONS -- J.P. MORGAN, BANK 
OF NEW YORK, AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK -- PROMISED TO INFORM 
THE SUCCESSOR STATES IF BELGRADE AUTHORITIES SOUGHT TO 
WITHDRAW THE MONEY.  BASED ON THESE ASSURANCES, THE GOC 
DECIDED NOT TO FILE AN INJUNCTION NOW, BUT WILL WHEN REQUIRED. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  281912Z 
 
7.   (C) ON THE NBY ASSETS, METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID THE USG 
DECISION TO UNBLOCK THEM THIS SPRING CONTINUED TO BE 
INEXPLICABLE TO HER.  MANY COUNTRIES HAD FROZEN SFRY ASSETS 
AND WERE NOT IN SUCH A HURRY TO UNBLOCK THEM NOW.  THESE 
COUNTRIES -- SHE WOULD NOT IDENTIFY WHICH -- WERE NOT 
PRESSING THE SUCCESSOR STATES, CONTENT INSTEAD TO WAIT FOR A 
SUCCESSION AGREEMENT TO COME IN TO FORCE.  WHY WERE THE 
AMERICANS IN SUCH A RUSH?  IF FREEZING THE ASSETS WAS SUCH A 
HEADACHE FOR U.S. AUTHORITIES, SHE ASKED, WOULD IT BE 
POSSIBLE FOR THE BANK OF INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS (BIS) TO 
ARRANGE TO HOLD THE MONEY PENDING A SUCCESSION AGREEMENT? 
SHE STRESSED AGAIN THAT ONLY BELGRADE AGREED WITH THE U.S. 
DECISION ON THE PHASED UNBLOCKING. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.   (C) TO HEAR IT FROM THE CROATIANS, THIS UNBLOCKING COULD 
TURN INTO A FOOD FIGHT -- OR AT LEAST A VERY LUCRATIVE 
PROPOSITION FOR CROATIA\'S, AND POSSIBLY OTHER SUCCESSOR 
STATES\', AMERICAN LAWYERS.  PRESS REPORTS HERE INDICATE THAT 
THE GOC IS PAYING UP TO $500 AN HOUR FOR LEGAL COUNSEL.  BOTH 
TECHNICAL EXPERTS RATHER THAN POLITICAL PLAYERS, ROGIC AND 
METELKO-ZGOMBIC WERE NOT IN VIENNA, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO COME 
ACROSS AS COMPLETELY CONVINCED OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THEIR 
CAUSE -- THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS UNFOLDED UNFAIRLY.  THEY 
STRESSED THAT ALL THE OTHER SUCCESSORS, MINUS BELGRADE, ARE 
ANGRY TOO -- AND URGED US TO TALK TO THEM DIRECTLY, 
PARTICULARLY THE BIH AND MACEDONIAN REPRESENTATIVES ON THE 
JOINT FINANCIAL COMMITTEE. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  281912Z 
 
9.   (C) ANOTHER POSSIBILITY RAISED BY THE SERBIAN AND 
MONTENEGRIN AMBASSADOR HERE IS THAT THE GOC LOOKED AT ANNEX G 
OF THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT -- WHICH CALLS FOR COMPENSATION 
FOR THOSE WHO LOST PRIVATE PROPERTY AND ACQUIRED RIGHTS, 
INCLUDING DISPLACED ETHNIC SERB REFUGEES -- AND REALIZED THE 
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS GOVERNMENT COULD BE TAKING ON 
FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FAR IN EXCESS OF THE $50 MILLION IT 
STANDS TO GAIN FROM RATIFYING THE ASI AND RECEIVING CROATIA\'S 
SHARE OF THE NBY ASSETS.  INDEED, ANNEX G, JUXTAPOSED AGAINST 
WHAT THE GOC HAS BEEN TELLING US OVER MANY MONTHS ABOUT ITS 
FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS IN COMPENSATING ETHNIC SERBS FOR LOST 
PROPERTY AND TENANCY RIGHTS, LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AGREED TO BY 
SOMEBODY NOT WORKING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM ZAGREB.  WE ASKED 
METELKO-ZGOMBIC IF THE GOC HAD OTHER CONCERNS IN THE ASI -- 
APART FROM THE MONEY MISSING IN THE JOINT VENTURE BANKS -- 
AND EVEN MENTIONED ANNEX G.  SHE SAID NO.  WE DO NOT QUESTION 
HER PERSONAL EARNESTNESS, BUT MORE BROADLY REMAIN SKEPTICAL 
ABOUT THE GOC\'S APPROACH TO THE ASI.

5.   (C) AT THE MFA, METELKO-ZGOMBIC TOOK AN EVEN TOUGHER 
LINE.  FIRST, SHE SAID THE ASI NEEDED TO BE RATIFIED.  THE 
DEAL STRUCK IN VIENNA WAS BASED ON A LIE -- THAT THERE WAS 
OVER $600 MILLION IN JOINT VENTURE BANK ACCOUNTS TO BE 
DISPERSED TO THE SUCCESSORS WHEN NO SUCH MONEY EXISTED. 
BASED ON THE FALSE INFORMATION -- AND THE FALSE PROSPECT THAT 
CROATIA STOOD TO GAIN OVER $200 MILLION WHEN THE MONEY WAS 
DISTRIBUTED -- CROATIA HAD ACCEPTED A PROBLEMATIC KEY. 
CROATIA WOULD RECEIVE ONLY 23 PERCENT OF THE SFRY\'S ASSETS,

METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID THAT THIS ASYMMETRY WAS UNFAIR WHEN THE 
DEAL WAS STRUCK, BUT COULD BE SWALLOWED GIVEN THE MONEY 
CROATIA STOOD TO GAIN.  AFTER ALMOST $545 MILLION TURNED UP 
MISSING, SHE ARGUED, THIS RENDERED THE ASYMMETRY IN THE KEY 
UNACCEPTABLE. 
 
LEGAL ROAD 
---------- 
 
6.  (C) THE LEGAL ADVISOR, WHOSE POSITION HAS REMAINED 
BASICALLY UNCHANGED IN THE ALMOST SIX MONTHS SINCE WE HAVE 
BEEN DISCUSSING THE ISSUE, OUTLINED WHAT LEGAL COURSE THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS TAKING.  SHE EMPHASIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
WAS PREPARED TO FIGHT THE OFAC UNBLOCKING INITIATIVES IN U.S. 
COURTS.  ON THE PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN PROPERTY THAT WERE 
UNBLOCKED ON FEBRUARY 25, IT WAS TRUE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD 
NOT SOUGHT AN INJUNCTION IN COURT, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE 
TAKEN AS INDICATION THAT THE GOC WAS ROLLING OVER.  THE GOC 
STILL ASSERTS THAT $40 MILLION OF THE $102 MILLION THAT WAS 
UNBLOCKED BELONGED TO THE SFRY AND SHOULD BE DISPERSED TO ALL 
THE SUCCESSORS.  TOGETHER WITH OTHER SUCCESSOR STATES AND 
THEIR U.S. LAWYERS, THE INSTITUTIONS HOLDING THESE ASSETS 
HAVE BEEN APPROACHED.  THE INSTITUTIONS -- J.P. MORGAN, BANK 
OF NEW YORK, AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK -- PROMISED TO INFORM 
THE SUCCESSOR STATES IF BELGRADE AUTHORITIES SOUGHT TO 
WITHDRAW THE MONEY.  BASED ON THESE ASSURANCES, THE GOC 
DECIDED NOT TO FILE AN INJUNCTION NOW, BUT WILL WHEN REQUIRED. 
 
7.   (C) ON THE NBY ASSETS, METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID THE USG 
DECISION TO UNBLOCK THEM THIS SPRING CONTINUED TO BE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  280958Z 
INEXPLICABLE TO HER.  MANY COUNTRIES HAD FROZEN SFRY ASSETS 
AND WERE NOT IN SUCH A HURRY TO UNBLOCK THEM NOW.  THESE 
COUNTRIES -- SHE WOULD NOT IDENTIFY WHICH -- WERE NOT 
PRESSING THE SUCCESSOR STATES, CONTENT INSTEAD TO WAIT FOR A 
SUCCESSION AGREEMENT TO COME IN TO FORCE.  WHY WERE THE 
AMERICANS IN SUCH A RUSH?  IF FREEZING THE ASSETS WAS SUCH A 
HEADACHE FOR U.S. AUTHORITIES, SHE ASKED, WOULD IT BE 
POSSIBLE FOR THE BANK OF INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS (BIS) TO 
ARRANGE TO HOLD THE MONEY PENDING A SUCCESSION AGREEMENT? 
SHE STRESSED AGAIN THAT ONLY BELGRADE AGREED WITH THE U.S. 
DECISION ON THE PHASED UNBLOCKING. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.   (C) TO HEAR IT FROM THE CROATIANS, THIS UNBLOCKING COULD 
TURN INTO A FOOD FIGHT -- OR AT LEAST A VERY LUCRATIVE 
PROPOSITION FOR CROATIA\'S, AND POSSIBLY OTHER SUCCESSOR 
STATES\', AMERICAN LAWYERS.  PRESS REPORTS HERE INDICATE THAT 
THE GOC IS PAYING UP TO $500 AN HOUR FOR LEGAL COUNSEL.  BOTH 
TECHNICAL EXPERTS RATHER THAN POLITICAL PLAYERS, ROGIC AND 
METELKO-ZGOMBIC WERE NOT IN VIENNA, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO COME 
ACROSS AS COMPLETELY CONVINCED OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THEIR 
CAUSE -- THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS UNFOLDED UNFAIRLY.  THEY 
STRESSED THAT ALL THE OTHER SUCCESSORS, MINUS BELGRADE, ARE 
ANGRY TOO -- AND URGED US TO TALK TO THEM DIRECTLY, 
PARTICULARLY THE BIH AND MACEDONIAN REPRESENTATIVES ON THE 
JOINT FINANCIAL COMMITTEE. 
 
9.   (C) ANOTHER POSSIBILITY RAISED BY THE SERBIAN AND 
MONTENEGRIN AMBASSADOR HERE IS THAT THE GOC LOOKED AT ANNEX G 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00450  02 OF 02  280958Z 
OF THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT -- WHICH CALLS FOR COMPENSATION 
FOR THOSE WHO LOST PRIVATE PROPERTY AND ACQUIRED RIGHTS, 
INCLUDING DISPLACED ETHNIC SERB REFUGEES -- AND REALIZED THE 
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS GOVERNMENT COULD BE TAKING ON 
FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FAR IN EXCESS OF THE $50 MILLION IT 
STANDS TO GAIN FROM RATIFYING THE ASI AND RECEIVING CROATIA\'S 
SHARE OF THE NBY ASSETS.  INDEED, ANNEX G, JUXTAPOSED AGAINST 
WHAT THE GOC HAS BEEN TELLING US OVER MANY MONTHS ABOUT ITS 
FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS IN COMPENSATING ETHNIC SERBS FOR LOST 
PROPERTY AND TENANCY RIGHTS, LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AGREED TO BY 
SOMEBODY NOT WORKING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM ZAGREB.  WE ASKED 
METELKO-ZGOMBIC IF THE GOC HAD OTHER CONCERNS IN THE ASI -- 
APART FROM THE MONEY MISSING IN THE JOINT VENTURE BANKS -- 
AND EVEN MENTIONED ANNEX G.  SHE SAID NO.  WE DO NOT QUESTION 
HER PERSONAL EARNESTNESS, BUT MORE BROADLY REMAIN SKEPTICAL 
ABOUT THE GOC\'S APPROACH TO THE ASI.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (S) THOMAS OSORIO (STRICTLY PROTECT), HEAD OF ICTY\'S 
ZAGREB OFFICE, TOLD US MARCH 4 THAT RECENT STATEMENTS BY OTP 
SPOKESPERSON HARTMANN AND OTP POLITICAL ADVISOR JORIS 
LAMBASTING THE GOC FOR ITS FAILURE TO CAPTURE ICTY INDICTEE 
ANTE GOTOVINA WERE \"UNPROFESSIONAL.\"  OSORIO TOLD US THAT HE 
HAS SEEN NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RECENT OTP CLAIMS 
THAT GOTOVINA IS \"MOVING FREELY\" IN CROATIA.  ACCORDING TO 
OSORIO, THE OTP WAS PREPARED CITE THE GOC FOR NON-COMPLIANCE 
ON TECHNICAL GROUNDS IF CROATIA DID NOT SERVE THE ICTY 
INDICTMENT TO GENERAL BOBETKO, EVEN THOUGH THE ICTY JUDGE WAS 
SET TO RULE THAT THE GENERAL\'S HEALTH PRECLUDED A TRIAL. 
WHILE THE OTP\'S FRUSTRATION IS UNDERSTANDABLE, MISMANAGEMENT 
OF THE GOTOVINA CASE AND PILING ON OVER BOBETKO UNDERCUTS THE 
ICTY\'S CREDIBILITY WITH ITS ALLIES AND STRENGTHENS THE HAND 
OF REJECTIONISTS JUST AS THE TRIBUNAL ENTERS A PERIOD OF 
INCREASING TENSION WITH THE GOC OVER NON-COMPLIANCE WITH 
DOCUMENT REQUESTS RELATED TO CROATIA\'S INVOLVEMENT IN BOSNIA 
DURING THE WAR. 
END SUMMARY.

ANOTHER INTEMPERATE BLAST FROM THE OTP 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) IN SEPARATE MEDIA INTERVIEWS ON FEBRUARY 27 AND 28, 
OTP SPOKESPERSON FLORENCE HARTMANN AND OTP POLITICAL ADVISOR 
JEAN-JAQUES JORIS ISSUED STATEMENTS SAYING THAT ICTY INDICTEE 
ANTE GOTOVINA WAS \"MOVING FREELY IN CROATIA,\" AND THAT THE 
GOC FAILED TO USE THE NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES IT HAD TO CATCH 
THE FUGITIVE.  JORIS WENT ON TO ADD THAT THE OTP HAD PROVIDED 
\"EVIDENCE\" TO THE GOC ON GOTOVINA, BUT YET THE GOC FAILED TO 
ACT.  BOTH HARTMANN AND JORIS ALSO OPENLY CRITICIZED CROATIAN 
COOPERATION ON DOCUMENT SHARING, HIGHLIGHTING SPECIFICALLY 
ITS FAILURE TO DELIVER BOSNIA-RELATED DOCUMENTS DESPITE 
NUMEROUS ICTY REQUESTS. 
 
3. (C) ON MARCH 3, WE MET WITH CROATIAN POLICE DIRECTOR RANKO 
OSTOJIC TO DISCUSS THE GOTOVINA CASE.  OSTOJIC REPEATED HIS 
MANTRA THAT THE POLICE FAITHFULLY FOLLOW UP ON EVERY LEAD, 
BUT ACTIONABLE EVIDENCE HAS NEVER BEEN PROVIDED (OR DEVELOPED 
BY THE CROATIANS).  A SPECIAL POLICE UNIT HAS GOTOVINA\'S 
FAMILY AND CLOSE ASSOCIATES UNDER SURVEILLANCE.  OSTOJIC, 
HOWEVER, CATEGORICALLY REFUTED JORIS\' CHARGE ON GOTOVINA. 
NEITHER HE, NOR AMBASSADOR KRNIC, THE HEAD OF THE GOC OFFICE 
FOR COOPERATION WITH ICTY, WHO RECENTLY VISITED THE HAGUE ON 
CONSULTATIONS, HAD RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION FROM THE OTP ON 
GOTOVINA\'S WHEREABOUTS. 
 
4. (SBU) PUBLICLY, THE GOC HAS DENIED THAT THERE IS ANY BREAK 
IN CROATIA\'S COOPERATION WITH THE ICTY.  PRIME MINISTER RACAN 
COMMENTED THAT, \"FOR VARIOUS REASONS,\" PEOPLE ARE ATTEMPTING 
                          SECRET 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00470  01 OF 03  052218Z 
\"TO FABRICATE\" A CONFLICT BETWEEN ICTY AND THE GOC. 
 
OTP NOT PROFESSIONAL 
-------------------- 
 
5. (S) IN LIGHT OF THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN THE OTP AND THE 
GOC, THE APPARENT DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE OTP AND THE GOC OVER 
INFORMATION SHARING AND OUR CONCERNS -- EXPRESSED REFTEL -- 
THAT THE OTP DOES NOT HAVE A COHERENT STRATEGY FOR DEALING 
WITH CROATIA, WE MET MARCH 4 WITH ICTY ZAGREB OFFICE HEAD 
THOMAS OSORIO (STRICTLY PROTECT THROUGHOUT).  WHILE CALLING 
THE OTP\'S HANDLING OF THE GOTOVINA CASE AMATEURISH, OSORIO 
CONFIRMED THAT THE OTP\'S COMPLAINTS ABOUT GOC DOCUMENT 
SHARING ARE VALID AND ARE REACHING CRISIS LEVELS. 
 
6. (S) ON GOTOVINA, THE OTP IS ITS OWN WORST ENEMY, OSORIO 
SAID.  AS FAR AS HE KNOWS, THERE IS NO NEW CREDIBLE 
INFORMATION AVAILABLE DEMONSTRATING GOTOVINA\'S PRESENCE IN 
CROATIA.  THERE WERE REPORTED SIGHTINGS OF GOTOVINA IN ZAGREB 
AROUND CHRISTMAS.  HOWEVER, THE OTI INVESTIGATORS, WHO 
DEVELOPED THE LEAD FROM INTERVIEWS WITH OTHER CROATIAN WAR 
CRIMES SUSPECTS, ONLY PROVIDED THE INFORMATION TO THE 
CROATIAN POLICE WELL AFTER THE FACT.  BY THAT TIME, THE LEAD 
-- IF INDEED IT EVER WAS CREDIBLE -- HAD GONE STALE. THIS 
ERROR WAS PART OF A CONTINUING TREND AMONG OTP OFFICIALS WHO

REFUSE TO VERIFY INFORMATION WITH THE LOCAL ZAGREB OFFICE 
WHICH HAS BEEN COORDINATING THE GOTOVINA INVESTIGATION WITH 
THE CROATIAN POLICE FROM THE OUTSET.  INSTEAD, OTI 
INVESTIGATORS PASS ON THOSE ERRONEOUS, STALE OR CIRCULAR 
LEADS TO JORIS, HARTMANN AND DEL PONTE AS FACT.  OSORIO SAID 
THAT HE URGENTLY CONTACTED OTP ADVISOR ANTON NIKIFOROV TO 
INTERCEDE WITH HARTMANN AND JORIS TO CORRECT THE RECORD.  HE 
ALSO ASKED THAT NIKOFOROV ENSURE THAT ANY FUTURE STATEMENTS 
ON GOTOVINA ARE SUPPORTED BY INCONTROVERTIBLE FACT. 
 
DOCUMENT SHARING: REAL GOC \"NON-COMPLIANCE\"? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (S) OSORIO SAYS THAT THE OTP VIEW OF CROATIAN COOPERATION 
ON DOCUMENT SHARING HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY FOR THE WORSE 
SINCE LAST OCTOBER, WHEN DEL PONTE TOLD THE UNSC THAT SHE WAS 
SATISFIED WITH CROATIAN COOPERATION.  OVER THE PAST FEW 
MONTHS, THE OTP HAS CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION 
AUDIT AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE GOC IS SUBSTANTIALLY 
LAGGING IN RESPONDING TO DOCUMENT REQUESTS ON A WIDE RANGE OF 
ISSUES.  AS REPORTED REFTEL, THE MAJOR GOC FAILING CONTINUES 
TO BE THE PROVISION OF DOCUMENTS ON CROATIAN INVOLVEMENT IN 
THE WAR IN BOSNIA. 
 
8. (S) WE ASKED OSORIO TO ADDRESS THE CROATIAN ARGUMENT, NOW 
BANDIED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA, THAT OTP DOCUMENT REQUESTS ARE 
TOO BROAD.  OSORIO SAID THAT SUCH CHARGES ARE FALSE. 
                          SECRET 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00470  02 OF 03  052222Z 
INVESTIGATORS ARE PUTTING TOGETHER THE FINAL PIECES OF THEIR 
CASES AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR, HE SAID. 
IN THE CASE OF THE BOSNIA, REQUESTS ARE VERY DETAILED, EVEN 
TO THE POINT WHERE INVESTIGATORS ARE SEEKING SPECIFIC 
TRANSCRIPTS OF CONVERSATIONS OF PRESIDENT TUDJMAN AND 
THEN-DEFENSE MINISTER GOJKO SUSAK FROM 1993.  THESE 
TRANSCRIPTS REPORTEDLY SHOW TUDJMAN DECIDING WHICH OFFICIALS 
SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO THE CROATIAN PARA-GOVERNMENT OF 
HERCEG-BOSNA AND ORDERING SPECIFIC UNITS OF THE CROATIAN 
MILITARY (HV) TO ENTER AND FIGHT IN BOSNIA.  ACCORDING TO 
OSORIO, IN ONE CASE, THE TRIBUNAL HAS A COPY OF SUCH A 
TRANSCRIPT AND MERELY ARE SEEKING A CERTIFIED COPY FOR 
EVIDENTIARY PURPOSES.  OSORIO SAID THAT THE GOC ALSO HAS 
FAILED TO PROVIDE BANK RECORDS RELATED TO THE TRANSFER OF 
FUNDING THROUGH PRIVREDNA BANKA TO SUPPORT HV AND HVO 
OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA. 
 
9. (S) ON JANUARY 30, DEL PONTE WROTE A LETTER TO DEPUTY 
PREMIER GORAN GRANIC, IN WHICH, ACCORDING TO OSORIO, THE ICTY 
CHIEF PROSECUTOR READ THE GOC \"THE RIOT ACT.\"  THE LETTER 
STATES THAT THE OTP IS \"CONCERNED AND DISAPPOINTED\" THAT 
DOCUMENTS \"ARE BEING WITHHELD\" AND THAT CROATIA IS \"NOT IN 
COMPLIANCE\" WITH ITS UNSC AND DAYTON OBLIGATIONS ON THE 
PROVISION OF BIH DOCUMENTATION.  THE JANUARY 30 LETTER STATES 
THAT IF THE GOC DOES NOT HAND OVER THE DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION 
BY APRIL 4, THE OTP WILL REQUEST THAT A JUDGE SUBPOENA THEM. 
THE OTP ALSO WILL ASK THE JUDGE TO ISSUE A SEARCH WARRANT, 
ARMED WITH WHICH ICTY OFFICIALS WOULD APPROACH PRIVREDNA 
BANKA TO OPEN ITS ARCHIVES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE OTP WILL 
PETITION THE JUDGE TO SUBPOENA THE GOC -- EITHER GRANIC OR 
KRNIC -- TO EXPLAIN TO THE TRIBUNAL CROATIAN NON-COMPLIANCE. 
                          SECRET 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00470  02 OF 03  052222Z 
THE ACT OF SUBPOENAING WOULD TRIGGER A REPORT OF 
NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE UNSC, OSORIO ADDED. 
 
10. (S) GRANIC REPLIED TO DEL PONTE IN MID-FEBRUARY, 
AFFIRMING THAT THE GOC WOULD MAKE ITS \"BEST EFFORT\" TO FIND 
THE DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION, BUT SOME DOCUMENTS \"DID NOT 
EXIST.\"  OTHER DOCUMENTS WOULD NOT BE \"EASY TO FIND\" BECAUSE 
THE INFORMATION THAT THE OTP PROVIDED WAS NOT SPECIFIC 
ENOUGH.  WITH REGARD TO THE BANK DOCUMENTS, GRANIC SAID THAT 
GOC EFFORTS TO PROVIDE THE DOCUMENTS WERE COMPLICATED BY 
CROATIAN BANK SECRECY LAWS. 
 
11. (S) WHILE OSORIO COULD NOT CONFIRM WHY THE GOC WAS 
WITHHOLDING THE DOCUMENTS -- IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT HV 
UNITS FOUGHT IN BOSNIA DURING THE WAR -- OSORIO AGREED WITH 
US THAT ONE POSSIBLE MOTIVE COULD BE GOC FEAR THAT THE 
DOCUMENTS WOULD CONFIRM DIRECT CROATIAN INTERVENTION IN 
BOSNIA FROM THE OUTSET OF THE WAR AS WELL AS THE INTENTION OF 
PRESIDENT TUDJMAN TO CARVE OUT OF BOSNIA AN ETHNICALLY PURE 
INDEPENDENT CROATIAN ENTITY.  OSORIO BELIEVED THESE FACTS 
WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR THE GOBIH TO FILE A STRONG 
SUIT AGAINST CROATIA FOR WAR REPARATIONS BEFORE THE 
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE.

---------------------------- 
 
12. (S) OSORIO DESCRIBED DEL PONTE AS BEING FRUSTRATED WITH 
BOTH THE ICTY PRESIDING JUDGE AND THE GOC ON THE BOBETKO 
CASE.  DEL PONTE IS \"PISSED OFF\" WITH THE PRESIDING JUDGE 
BECAUSE HE HAS NOT RULED ON THE MEDICAL EXPERT TEAM\'S REPORT 
ON GENERAL BOBETKO AND ON THE GENERAL\'S FITNESS TO STAND 
TRIAL.  THE OTP\'S EXPECTATION STILL IS THAT THE JUDGE WILL 
RULE THAT BOBETKO IS UNFIT. 
 
13. (S) AT THE SAME TIME, DEL PONTE IS FURIOUS AT THE 
CROATIAN COURTS FOR NOT ORDERING THAT THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT 
BE DELIVERED TO THE ACCUSED OR TO HIS LAWYERS, AS IS 
SPECIFIED UNDER CROATIAN LAW.  POINTING TO A FEBRUARY 13 
LOCAL PRESS REPORT IN WHICH BOBETKO RECEIVED LOCAL HDZ 
OFFICIALS IN THE HOSPITAL, OSORIO SAID THAT IF BOBETKO IS FIT 
ENOUGH TO RECEIVE LOCAL GUESTS, HE IS FIT ENOUGH TO RECEIVE 
THE INDICTMENT.  THE OTP IS PREPARING A REQUEST TO THE GOC 
THAT IT -- AS THE OTP\'S LOCAL AGENT -- FILE A MOTION BEFORE 
THE PRESIDING ZAGREB JUDGE TO REQUEST HIM TO SERVE THE 
INDICTMENT TO BOBETKO OR HIS LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES.  FAILURE 
OF THE GOC TO ACT ON THE OTP\'S BEHALF WOULD BE ANOTHER REASON 
TO CITE CROATIA FOR NON-COMPLIANCE, OSORIO SAID.  WHILE HE 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME COULD PERCEIVE THIS APPROACH AS \"SOUR 
GRAPES,\" HE SAID IT WAS AN IMPORTANT POINT OF PRINCIPAL THAT 
STATES COMPLY FULLY WITH ALL THEIR OBLIGATIONS.  THIS IS ONE 
SUCH CASE.

14. (C) THE OTP\'S PREDILECTION TO ISSUE UNSUBSTANTIATED 
STATEMENTS ON GOTOVINA\'S WHEREABOUTS AND ITS LACK OF 
CONSULTATION WITH ITS OWN EXPERTS ON THE GROUND DAMAGES THE 
OTP\'S CREDIBILITY WITH THE ICTY\'S INTERNATIONAL SUPPORTERS, 
PARTICULARLY WITH US AND THE BRITISH.  THE OTP MUST MAKE 
CLEAR TO US WHAT EVIDENCE IT HAS ON GOTOVINA.  MORE BROADLY, 
IT MUST DO A FAR BETTER JOB IN MANAGING ITS CROATIA PORTFOLIO 
IF WE ARE TO WEIGH IN EFFECTIVELY ON ICTY\'S BEHALF WITH 
RECALCITRANT GOC OFFICIALS. 
 
15. (C) THE OTP\'S MISHANDLING OF THE GOTOVINA CASE THREATENS

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) IN A MARCH 3 INTRODUCTORY CALL ON NEW DEPUTY FOREIGN 
MINISTER SIMONOVIC, THE AMBASSADOR REVIEWED THE U.S. APPROACH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00489  01 OF 03  061511Z 
ON IRAQ, STEPS TOWARD CROATIA,S CANDIDACY FOR NATO 
MEMBERSHIP, THE SFRY ASSETS SUCCESSION ISSUES, OUR REQUEST 
FOR AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH CROATIA, ICTY COMPLIANCE, 
REFUGEE RETURNS AND THE UPCOMING UNCHR SESSION.  SIMONOVIC 
CONFIRMED THAT CROATIA DOES NOT SEE A MAJOR ROLE FOR ITSELF 
ON IRAQ, BUT STILL WANTED TO BE SUPPORTIVE.  CROATIA WOULD 
READILY PURSUE REGIONAL INITIATIVES (INCLUDING THE ADRIATIC 
CHARTER) BUT DID NOT WANT TO ENDANGER CLOSE TIES TO WESTERN 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  SIMONOVIC SAID CROATIA DID NOT WANT TO 
BE AN OBSTACLE TO THE UNFREEZING OF SFRY ASSETS AND WANTED A 
QUICK RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS WITH THE AGREEMENT ON 
SUCCESSION ISSUES.  HE SAID THAT THE GOC MUST DO A BETTER JOB 
ON ICTY AND REFUGEE RETURNS.  ACCORDING TO THE NEW DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER, CROATIA HAS A BRIEF WINDOW REMAINING FOR 
TOUGH DECISIONS; THE UPCOMING ELECTION SEASON WOULD SOON 
CLOSE THE DOOR ON UNPOPULAR ACTIONS BY THE GOC COALITION. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
IRAQ 
---- 
 
2.  (C) IN HIS INTRODUCTORY CALL ON NEWLY ARRIVED DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVAN SIMONOVIC (UNTIL RECENTLY CROATIA,S UN 
PERMREP) ON MARCH 3, AMBASSADOR ROSSIN ASKED FOR CROATIA\'S 
SUPPORT AT THE UN FOR U.S. OBJECTIVES ON IRAQ.  SIMONOVIC 
SAID HE DID NOT FORESEE A MAJOR ROLE FOR CROATIA AND 
INDICATED HIS BELIEF THAT THE UNSC WOULD APPROVE A SECOND 
RESOLUTION, WHICH WAS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PRESERVING THE 
RELEVANCE AND CREDIBILITY OF THE UN.  HE SPECULATED THAT IT 
WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO INSTALL TRUE DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ 
GIVEN THE ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS TENSIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00489  01 OF 03  061511Z 
THANKED CROATIA FOR ITS RECENT DECISION TO PERMIT FLOW 
THROUGH OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CARRYING U.S. TROOPS TO THE 
REGION.  WHILE WE DID NOT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AT THIS 
TIME, IT WAS POSSIBLE THE U.S. WOULD SEEK ADDITIONAL 
COOPERATION IN THE FUTURE TO SUPPORT OUR MILITARY OPERATIONS. 
 THE U.S. SOUGHT A CLOSE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOC ON THE IRAQ 
SITUATION. 
 
NATO AND CROATIA 
---------------- 
 
3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED PROGRESS ON THE ADRIATIC CHARTER 
TEXT AND RECONFIRMED HIS ATTENDANCE AT THE MEETING OF THE 
THREE FOREIGN MINISTERS IN DUBROVNIK ON MARCH 7.  HE PRESSED 
FOR A STRONG STATEMENT ON IRAQ IN THE PLANNED DUBROVNIK 
DECLARATION.  REFERRING TO THE CROATIAN LANGUAGE ON 
INDIVIDUAL TRACKS INSERTED INTO THE DRAFT CHARTER, SIMONOVIC 
ADMITTED THAT CROATIA HAD BEEN RELUCTANT TO PURSUE REGIONAL 
COOPERATION FOR FEAR OF CUTTING INCREASINGLY CLOSE RELATIONS 
WITH WESTERN EUROPEAN STATES.  HOWEVER, HE ASSURED THE 
AMBASSADOR, WITH UNSUAL ANIMATION, THAT CROATIA WAS FULLY 
COMMITTED TO CLOSE COOPERATION WITH REGIONAL PARTNERS AND 
WOULD SEEK TO PROMOTE THE CANDIDACIES OF OTHER MAP COUNTRIES. 
 CROATIA WOULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE AT THE EU SUMMIT IN 
THESSALONIKI. 
 
4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT SINCE CROATIA HAD A 
REPUTATION FOR WANTING TO GO ITS OWN WAY, GOC REPRESENTATIVES 
MUST SAY EXPLICITLY AND OFTEN THAT CROATIA SUPPORTS REGIONAL 
COOPERATION.  A COMPETITIVE APPROACH DENIGRATING OTHER 
ASPIRANTS AND INVITEES DOES NOT HELP CROATIA.  THE AMBASSADOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00489  01 OF 03  061511Z 
STRESSED THAT THE U.S. STRONGLY SUPPORTED CROATIA\'S NATO 
ASPIRATIONS AND WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. 
HOWEVER, CROATIA NEEDED TO DO MORE ON DEFENSE REFORMS, ICTY 
COOPERATION, REFUGEE RETURNS, AND JUDICIAL REFORM.  CROATIA 
NEEDED TO PUT OUT A POSITIVE MESSAGE OF PROGRESS ON THESE 
ISSUES AND NOT BE SEEN AS COMBATIVE OR \"WHINING\" IN RESPONSE 
TO INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM. 
 
ICC ) ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT CROATIA 
WAS WAITING FOR AN EU MEMBER STATE MODEL ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT 
BEFORE MOVING AHEAD WITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. 
SIMONOVIC CONFIRMED THIS BUT ALSO ASKED THAT THE U.S. NOT 
PRESS TOO HARD FOR AN AGREEMENT, REFERRING TO THE SENSITIVITY 
OF AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT DUE TO PERCEIVED INEQUITIES IN THE 
PUBLIC,S MIND BETWEEN U.S. OBJECTIVES AND CROATIA,S ICTY 
OBLIGATIONS.  HOWEVER, HE CONFIRMED THAT CROATIA WOULD BE 
READY TO MOVE AHEAD ONCE THERE IS AN EU STATE MODEL 
AGREEMENT.  IN THAT REGARD, HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD BE ABLE 
TO MAKE TIMELY PROGRESS ON SUCH A MODEL AGREEMENT.  THE 
AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER THE PROVISIONS 
AND DEADLINE  OF THE ASPA.  WE COULD NOT PREDICT HOW IT WOULD 
BE IMPLEMENTED BUT WAIVERS COULD NOT BE PRESUMED.  CROATIA

ICTY ISSUES 
----------- 
 
6.  (C) SIMONOVIC ADMITTED THAT THE GOC HAD HANDLED THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00489  02 OF 03  061511Z 
BOBETKO CASE BADLY, AT LEAST INITIALLY.  THE HAPHAZARDLY 
LAUNCED LEGAL APPROACH HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL, BUT LUCK (E.G., 
WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT) HAD PLAYED TOO LARGE A ROLE. 
BUT THAT CASE WAS NOW \"MORE OR LESS\" RESOLVED.  IT WAS CLEAR 
THAT CROATIA NEEDED A \"SUCCESSFUL CASE\" TO DEMONSTRATE ITS 
FULL COMMITMENT TO ITS ICTY OBLIGATIONS.  HE ADDED THAT 
INDICTMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL TRANSFER OF CROATIAN OFFICERS 
FOR COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY CHARGES DO NOT SIT WELL WITH THE 
CROATIAN PUBLIC.  HE HAD HEARD THAT THERE MAY BE UP TO FIVE 
ADDITIONAL INDICTMENTS OF CROATIAN CITIZENS BEING STUDIED BY 
THE ICTY. 
 
7.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THE BOBETKO CASE WAS NOW 
BEHIND US, BUT WARNED THAT BECAUSE OF GOC SHORTCOMINGS IN THE 
HANDLING OF THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT, THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY WOULD BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE GOC,S 
PERFORMANCE ON ANY NEW INDICTMENTS.  THEY MUST BE HANDLED 
QUICKLY AND QUIETLY TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL COMPLIANCE.  IN 
ADDITION, THE U.S. AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY ARE LOOKING FOR MORE ACTIVE AND VIGOROUS GOC 
ACTIONS TO LOCATE AND CAPTURE ICTY INDICTEE GOTOVINA.  WE 
KNEW SPECIFICALLY OF THINGS THE GOC CLAIMED IT WAS DOING TO 
FIND GOTOVINA THAT, IN FACT, IT WAS NOT DOING. 
 
8.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ADVISED SIMONOVIC THAT THE U.S. WAS 
PREPARING TO RE-LAUNCH ITS INITIATIVE TO ASSIST THE GOC WITH 
LOCAL WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS.  HE ANTICIPATED A U.S. 
PROPOSAL SOON FOR A U.S. TEAM TO VISIT IN APRIL OR MAY. 
SIMONOVIC WELCOMED THIS, REFERRING TO PROPOSED REFORMS IN THE 
JUDICIAL SECTOR AND PLANS TO ESTABLISH FOUR REGIONAL COURTS 
TO TRY WAR CRIMES CASES. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

UNCHR SESSION 
------------- 
 
9  (C) THE AMBASSADOR REMINDED SIMONOVIC THAT THE LINE UP IN 
THIS YEAR,S UNCHR SESSION WAS BAD, STARTING WITH LIBYA,S 
INSTALLATION AS CHAIRMAN.  THE U.S. WANTED TO WORK CLOSELY 
WITH CROATIA TO PROMOTE A PRODUCTIVE SESSION.  SIMONOVIC 
FULLY AGREED WITH THE AMBASSADOR,S POINTS, NOTING CROATIA\'S 
BOARD PARTICIPATION THIS YEAR.  HE LAMENTED EXCESSIVE 
POLITIZATION IN THE FORUM. 
 
SFRY -- SUCCESSION ASSETS 
------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE U.S. INTENTION TO UNBLOCK 
SFRY NBY ASSETS LOCATED IN THE U.S.  HE NOTED THAT THE U.S. 
WAS STILL SEEKING A HOLD HARMLESS STATEMENT FROM THE GOC AND 
HOPED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REVERSE ITS OPPOSITION.  HE 
WOULD RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH FM PICULA IN AN UPCOMING MEETING. 
 SIMONOVIC RESPONDED THAT CROATIA DID NOT WANT TO BE AN 
OBSTACLE TO THE U.S. INITIATIVE AND URGED THAT BOTH SIDES 
SEEK A SOLUTION SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.  HE POINTED OUT 
THAT A GOC DECISION TO ACCEDE TO THE U.S. REQUEST ON THIS 
ISSUE ) LIKE A NUMBER OF OTHER DIFFICULT ISSUES BEFORE THE 
GOC ) WOULD NOT SIT WELL WITH THE PUBLIC.  WITH ELECTIONS 
EXPECTED EITHER THIS FALL OR PERHAPS EARLY NEXT YEAR, THE GOC 
WOULD WANT TO MAKE THE UNPLEASANT DECISIONS BEFORE THE 
PRE-ELECTION WINDOW CLOSED IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS.  THE 
AMBASSADOR AGREED AND ADDED HIS HOPE THAT A GOC DECISION TO 
FOREGO $50 MILLION PLUS FROM THE NBY DISTRIBUTION WOULD NOT

REFUGEE RETURNS 
--------------- 
 
11.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED OUR CONCERNS REGARDING REFUGEE 
RETURNS ARE ASSUMING STEADILY MORE PROMINENCE IN CROATIA\'S 
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  SIMONOVIC SAID THAT CROATIA MUST BE 
MUCH MORE PROACTIVE ON THIS ISSUE, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE REAL 
PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY WITH ADDRESSING THE TENANCY RIGHTS 
ISSUE.  ON THE TENANCY RIGHTS ISSUE, THE AMBASSADOR URGED 
THAT THE GOC PRIORITIZE ITS ACTIONS AND PUT PRIMARY FOCUS ON 
CASES WHERE ACTUAL REFORMS HINGE ON PROVIDING FARMER TENANTS 
A HOUSING OPTION.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE U.S. AND EU STATES HAD 
NOT SEEN MUCH MOVEMENT ON THIS FROM THE GOC SIDE. 
RECONSTRUCTION MINISTER CACIC HAD BEEN ENCOURAGING BUT VAGUE 
ON AN ISSUE WHERE CONCRETE STEPS ARE HUGELY OVERDUE.  PM 
RACAN HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTING ON THIS ISSUE. 
 
12.  (C) SIMONOVIC AGREED THAT THE GOC NEEDS TO ACT BUT THAT 
THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS WOULD LIMIT THE GOC\'S MANEUVERING 
ROOM.  IN ANY EVENT, HE CLAIMED THAT CROATIAN PUBLIC OPINION 
IS NOW MUCH MORE FAVORABLE TOWARD THE RETURN OF CROATIAN 
SERBS.  IN FACT, HE ASSERTED, THE GOC HAS DONE FAR MORE THAN 
WAS THOUGHT POSSIBLE FIVE YEARS AGO.

13.  (C) SIMONOVIC IMPRESSED US AS A BUSINESSLIKE

FROM USUN OF A VERY LAWYERLIKE APPROACH WERE AMPLY BORNE OUT.

 HE MAY WELL PROVE TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN FORCING THE LEADEN 
MFA BUREAUCRACY TOWARD TIMELY ACTION AND REASONABLE POSITIONS 
THAT RESPOND TO CONCERNS COMING FROM THE U.S. AND OTHERS IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
14.  (C) HOWEVER, WE ARE CONCIOUS THAT HIS BACKGROUND AND 
PAST USG INTERACTIONS HAVE SUGGESTED A STRONG NATIONALIST 
STREAK UNDER THE URBANE SURFACE.  CERTAINLY, IN THE MEETING 
SIMONOVIC PUT THE MOST FAVORABLE SPIN ON EACH RESPONSE, 
HIGHLIGHTING CROATIA\'S HANDICAPS AND \"NEED FOR UNDERSTANDING\" 
WHILE SEEKING TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS A SYMPATHETIC FRIEND TO 
THE U.S. IN A SOMETIMES UNFRIENDLY COURT.  HIS OBSERVATIONS 
ABOUT THE VERY SHORT WINDOW AVAILABLE FOR THE GOC TO TAKE 
UNPOPULAR DECISIONS RANG TRUE, ALTHOUGH THIS COALITION 
GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS LED BY A PRIME MINISTER WHO SEEKS 
CONSENSUS AT ALL COSTS, HAS SHOWN LITTLE INCLINATION TO TAKE 
UNPOPULAR (EVEN IF NECESSARY) DECISIONS REGARDLESS OF THE 
TIMING.

) 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1.  (SBU) THE POLITICAL CONFLICT OVER THE ABORTED 
PRIVATIZATION OF THE SUNCANI HVAR HOTEL GROUP, REPORTED REFS 
A AND B, IS HAMPERING PROGRESS ON THE REST OF THE PORTFOLIO 
OF THE CROATIAN PRIVATIZATION FUND (CPF) AND MORE GENERALLY 
ON CROATIA\'S WHOLE ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM.  THE ANIMUS 
TOWARD PRIVATIZATION THAT CONTRIBUTED IN PART TO THE SUNCANI 
HVAR CRISIS, TOGETHER WITH UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS, IS ALSO 
CASTING DOUBT ON THE VIABILITY OF THE PARTIAL PRIVATIZATION 
OF 25 PERCENT PLUS ONE SHARE OF THE STATE OIL COMPANY, INA. 
WITH PRIVATIZATION RECEIPTS DOWN, THIS COULD RAISE SERIOUS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

CONCERNS ABOUT CROATIA\'S ABILITY TO FULFILL THE CONDITIONS OF 
ITS PRECAUTIONARY STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT (REF C).  ALSO IN 
DOUBT IS THE GOC\'S ABILITY TO SATISFY WORLD BANK CONDITIONS 
FOR ITS STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SUNCANI HVAR EPISODE CASTING LONG SHADOW 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) WHILE RUMORS THAT PERSONAL INTEREST ON THE PART OF 
PROMINENT HSS (CROATIAN PEASANTS PARTY) MEMBERS PLAYED A KEY 
ROLE IN THE CANCELLATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL TENDER FOR 
SUNCANI HVAR ARE INTRIGUING, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT GENERAL 
SUSPICION OF PRIVATIZATION IN THE RULING COALITION -- 
PARTICULARLY IN THE HSS -- ALSO PLAYED A ROLE.  HNS (CROATIAN 
PEOPLES\' PARTY) PRESIDENT, VESNA PUSIC, TOLD THE AMBASSADOR 
ON FEBRUARY 25 THAT, WHILE THERE WERE ERRORS IN THE 
PREPARATION OF DECISION DOCUMENTS FOR THE SUNCANI HVAR 
TENDER, THEY DID NOT MERIT LEVEL OF REACTION THE SALE 
RECEIVED. 
 
3.  (C) WHILE MOST OF OUR GOC CONTACTS AT THE WORKING LEVEL 
IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE AND THE MINISTRIES OF TOURISM, 
ECONOMY AND FINANCE UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY OF ATTRACTING 
FOREIGN INVESTMENT, WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETING 
KNOW-HOW IN TOURISM, THE GENERAL PUBLIC THINKS THAT 
PRIVATIZATION OFTEN EQUALS CORRUPTION AND THAT, IF 
PRIVATIZATION MUST OCCUR, CROATIANS SHOULD BE GIVEN 
PREFERENCE IN ANY TENDERS.  SALES OF COASTAL ASSETS ARE 
PARTICULARLY CONTROVERSIAL.  AND SALES TO SLOVENIANS -- ABOUT 
WHOM CROATS HAVE A SIZABLE CHIP ON THEIR COLLECTIVE SHOULDER 
-- ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00491  01 OF 04  070943Z 
 
4.  (U) A COMMISSION OF THREE MINISTERS WAS TECHNICALLY 
APPOINTED TO \"REVIEW\" THE TENDER FOR THE SALE OF SUNCANI 
HVAR.  WHEN A WEEK LATER THE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THE 
CANCELLATION OF THE SALE, NO ONE WAS SURPRISED.  THE OFFICIAL 
RESOLUTION ON THE CANCELLATION CONTAINED NO EXPLANATION OF 
WHY THE INTERNATIONAL TENDER WAS CANCELLED, BUT CITED SIMPLY 
\"OMISSIONS\" OR \"FAILURES.\"  IN A POLITICAL FLOURISH, THE 
STATEMENT, SIGNED BY THE PRIME MINISTER, DISSOLVED THE 
SUPERVISORY BOARD OF THE PRIVATIZATION FUND AND RELIEVED OF 
THEIR DUTIES DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SLAVKO LINIC, SDP (RULING 
SOCIAL DEMOCRAT) STALWART AND PRIME PROMOTER OF 
PRIVATIZATION, MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE BOZIDAR PANKRETIC 
(HSS), MINISTER OF TOURISM PAVE ZUPAN RUSKOVIC 
(NON-PARTISAN), MINISTER OF FINANCE CRKVENAC (SDP) AND 
MINISTER OF ECONOMY JURCIC (NON-PARTISAN). 
 
5.  (SBU) THE HOLLOWNESS OF THIS GESTURE IS BETRAYED BY THE 
FACT THAT THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE RESOLUTION TASKS THE 
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY -- WHOSE HEAD WAS JUST RELIEVED OF HIS 
DUTIES ON THE SUPERVISORY BOARD BECAUSE OF \"OMISSIONS\" -- TO 
DRAW UP A NEW LAW REFORMING THE PRIVATIZATION FUND. 
 
6.  (SBU) SINCE THE \"OMISSIONS\" WERE CONVENIENTLY NEVER

DEFINED, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHETHER THE RESULTING 
PROPOSAL FOR \"REFORMING\" THE CPF ADDRESSES THEM.  THE CURRENT 
PROPOSAL CIRCULATING EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF THE CPF\'S MANDATE 
TO INCLUDE DISPOSAL OF STATE-OWNED REAL ESTATE AND TO BECOME 
SOMETHING OF AN INVESTMENT AND EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY.  THE 
PLAN APPEARS TO BE A HASTILY DUSTED-OFF VERSION OF ONE 
ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED UNDER EX-PRESIDENT OF THE PRIVATIZATION 
FUND AND LATER MINISTER OF ECONOMY, HRVOJE VOJKOVIC.  WHILE 
WE HAVE NOT FULLY EVALUATED THE PLAN, ONE IMMEDIATELY EVIDENT 
FLAW IS THAT IT DUPLICATES FUNCTIONS OF EXISTING AGENCIES, 
ESPECIALLY THE NEWLY-CREATED AGENCY FOR EXPORT AND INVESTMENT 
PROMOTION.  THE NEW PLAN WILL REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE PERSONNEL

7.  (SBU) IN THE MEANTIME, WITHOUT A SUPERVISORY BOARD THE 
CPF CANNOT APPROVE NEW TENDERS.  IT CAN CARRY OUT SOME 
ROUTINE BUSINESS, SUCH AS SELLING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGES 
PACKAGES OF MINORITY SHARES (USUALLY BOUGHT BY THE MAJORITY 
SHAREHOLDERS), AND DOING THE PREPARATORY WORK FOR THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

TENDERING OF COMPANIES, MUCH OF IT WITH THE HELP OF USAID 
CONTRACTORS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CASTING ABOUT TO FIND SOME 
WAY TO CONTINUE WITH THE MOST PRESSING ITEMS IN THE 
PRIVATIZATION PORTFOLIO -- INCLUDING SELLING OFF A NUMBER OF 
STATE AGRICULTURAL COMPANIES (AGROKOMBINATS) THAT ARE 
BASICALLY BANKRUPT.  THE STATE DOES NOT EXPECT TO EARN MUCH 
REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF THESE COMPANIES, BUT DOES HOPE THAT 
THE AGROKOMBINATS WILL, IN AT LEAST SOME CASES, RECEIVE 
DESPERATELY NEEDED INJECTIONS OF CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT 
KNOW-HOW. 
 
8.   (SBU) IF THESE COMPANIES ARE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN, 
THOUSANDS OF RURAL WORKERS COULD BE LEFT WITHOUT JOBS -- 
HARDLY A DESIRABLE RESULT FOR THE RURAL-BASED HSS.  IN AT 
LEAST ONE CASE, THERE ARE ATTRACTIVE DOMESTIC BIDDERS WAITING 
IN THE WINGS; IN ANOTHER A MANAGEMENT-EMPLOYEE BUYOUT WAS IN 
THE WORKS.  THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION OF HAVING THE CABINET 
APPROVE THESE TENDERS DIRECTLY.  THE IDEA CURRENTLY BEING 
FLOATED IS TO APPOINT AN INTERIM BOARD TO APPROVE A LIMITED 
NUMBER OF PRIORITY TENDERS.  ONE THING IS CLEAR -- ONLY 
TENDERS WITHOUT A WHIFF OF CONTROVERSY COULD BE APPROVED. 
 
HEADACHES FOR THE WORLD BANK 
---------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) IF THE AGROKOMBINATS ARE NOT PRIVATIZED, THERE WILL 
BE ENORMOUS PRESSURE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE 
SUBSIDIES.  IN WHAT IS AN ELECTION YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT MAY 
CAVE.  THIS WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S BUDGET, 
PUSHING IT ABOVE ITS FIVE PERCENT OF GDP DEFICIT TARGET -- 
THEREBY IMPERILING CROATIA\'S STANDBY ARRANGEMENT WITH THE IMF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00491  02 OF 04  070944Z 
AND THE DISBURSEMENT OF THE SECOND TRANCHE OF THE WORLD 
BANK\'S STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN.  WORLD BANK SOURCES HERE 
SUSPECT THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT MISS ITS SUBSIDY REDUCTION 
TARGET, BUT TOLD US THEY HOPE FOR A STRONG SHOWING ON THE 
GOC\'S OTHER PRIOR ACTIONS.  THIS IS FAR FROM CERTAIN, AS THE 
UNIONS GEAR UP TO OPPOSE THE DRAFT CHANGES TO THE LABOR LAW, 
WHICH AS SUBMITTED TO THE PARLIAMENT, ONLY MINIMALLY MEETS 
WORLD BANK CONDITIONS. 
 
CONCERNS ABOUT \"THE BIG ONE\" 
---------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) MEANWHILE, PRIVATIZATION PROBLEMS CAST A BIG CLOUD 
OVER INA, THE STATE PETROLEUM COMPANY, 25 PERCENT OF WHICH 
THE GOC WOULD LIKE TO SELL OFF.  WHILE THE INA PRIVATIZATION 
DOES NOT FALL UNDER THE PRIVATIZATION FUND, IT IS AT LEAST AS 
POLITICAL AS THE \"NON-STRATEGIC\" PRIVATIZATIONS.  THE 
GOVERNMENT IS KEEPING A TIGHT LID ON INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
BIDS, BUT THE RUMORS ARE NOT GOOD.  WE INITIALLY HEARD THAT 
THE RUSSIAN BID WAS THE BEST OF A BAD LOT, BUT WOULD REQUIRE 
THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THE REFINERY IN SISAK (A DEATH KNELL FOR 
THIS TOWN ALREADY STRUGGLING UNDER THE CLOSURE OF ITS 
OBSOLETE STEEL MILL), AND DANGEROUS POLITICALLY.  THE RUSSIAN 
BID WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT INA PUT UP AN EVEN GREATER AMOUNT

EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT IS 
NEGOTIATING INTENSELY WITH AUSTRIA\'S OMV, AND HAS YET TO 
BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WITH HUNGARY\'S MOL.  LATELY, THE 
SPIN-DOCTORS HAVE BEEN LEAKING THAT THE OMV BID IS THE 
FAVORED ONE. 
 
11.  (SBU) UNFORTUNATELY, THE GOC HAS PROBABLY DONE A BETTER 
JOB CONVINCING THE CROATIAN PUBLIC THAN THE BIDDERS THAT INA 
IS A CROWN JEWEL -- CLEANING UP ITS BOOKS BY WRITING OFF 
DEBT, TRUMPETING THE \"RETURN TO PROFITABILITY\" OF A COMPANY 
THAT IS SLOWLY DETERIORATING -- AND THE RESULT WILL BE THAT 
ANY RATIONAL OFFER WILL PROBABLY BE ATTACKED AS SELLING OFF 
CROATIA\'S PATRIMONY FOR A SONG.  IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL 
CLIMATE, THERE WILL NEED TO BE NEAR-UNANIMITY ON THE TENDER 
DECISION.  WE HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE -- LAST YEAR THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING THE PRICE

12.  (SBU) FINDING A STRATEGIC PARTNER IS ESSENTIAL FOR INA; 
WITHOUT AN INJECTION OF CAPITAL, ITS REFINERIES WILL FALL 
FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND.  IN A FEW YEARS, IT WILL BE 
UNABLE TO EXPORT TO WESTERN EUROPE BECAUSE IT WILL NOT MEET 
EU QUALITY STANDARDS.  INA ALSO NEEDS THE MARKETING LINKS 
THAT A GOOD PARTNER WOULD BRING.  NEVERTHELESS, THE 
GOVERNMENT, WITH THE CONNIVANCE OF THE MANAGEMENT OF INA, IS 
PUTTING CONDITIONS ON THE SALE -- SUCH AS RETENTION OF ALL 
EMPLOYEES FOR THREE YEARS -- THAT MAKE THIS PARTIAL SALE 
PROBLEMATIC. 
 
13.  (C) IF THE INA SALE DOES NOT GO THROUGH, THE GOC\'S 
PROGRAM WITH THE IMF COULD BE IN TROUBLE.  THE IMF LETTER OF 
INTENT (LOI) SETS A DEADLINE OF ANNOUNCING THE RESULTS OF THE 
TENDER BY THIS MONTH.  UNLESS A SWEET DEAL IS NEGOTIATED, THE 
RESULT COULD BE THAT THE GOVERNMENT REJECTS ALL THE BIDS. 
THE LOI GOES ON TO SAY THAT IF PRIVATIZATION REVENUES (1.2 
PERCENT OF GDP FOR THIS YEAR) FALL SHORT, THEN THE GOVERNMENT 
MUST CUT SPENDING, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE DEBT LOAD FROM 
RISING.  WHEN WE ASKED THE IMF REPRESENTATIVE WHETHER HE 
THOUGHT THE GOC COULD MAKE ITS REVENUE TARGETS WITHOUT A 
SUCCESSFUL INA PRIVATIZATION, HE THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY. 
ADDITIONALLY, EVEN IF THERE ARE HIGHER THAN PROJECTED TAX 
REVENUES, THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD ON THE EXPENDITURE 
FRONT, SINCE THE GOC\'S DOWNSIZING OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 
IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AS WELL.

ASSISTANCE TO THE GOC FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION OF THE 
PRIVATIZATION PROCESS, THE GOVERNMENT WAS RESISTANT.  A 
LOW-KEY CAMPAIGN BEGAN WITH ONLY THE SUPPORT OF THE DEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTER\'S OFFICE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CPF.  WHILE 
PUBLIC OPINION POLLS SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN ATTITUDES BY A 
PUBLIC REFLEXIVELY OPPOSED TO PRIVATIZATION -- DECADES OF 
SOCIALISM UNDER TITO AND YEARS OF CRONY CAPITALISM UNDER 
TUDJMAN HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL -- ENTHUSIASM FOR THE EDUCATION 
PROCESS SPREAD AMONG OTHER PARTIES OF THE RULING COALITIO,N 
AND THE GOC EXPANDED THE PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN WITH ITS 
OWN FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  JOURNALISTS INCLUDED IN THE 
EDUCATIONAL PROCESS WERE EXPOSED TO PRIVATIZATION-REPORTING

STORY, THEY DEMONSTRATED THE MOST BALANCED REPORTING IN THE 
HISTORY OF CROATIAN PRIVATIZATION.

THAT COULD RESULT IN LAYOFFS, INVOLVE FOREIGN OWNERSHIP, OR

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) AS OF MARCH 10, CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING U.S. 
TROOPS TO SUPPORT POTENTIAL ACTION IN IRAQ MAY TRANSIT 
CROATIAN AIRSPACE WITH THE STANDARD ICAO FLIGHT PLAN AS THE 
ONLY ADVANCE WARNING REQUIRED, PROVIDED THEY DO NOT INTEND TO 
LAND.  TWENTY-FOUR HOURS ADVANCE NOTICE IS REQUIRED FOR 
FLIGHTS WHICH INTEND TO LAND AND REFUEL.  THE GOC INTERAGENCY 
WORKING GROUP FINALIZED MODALITIES AND STANDARD OPERATING 
PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT THE FEBRUARY 26 GOVERNMENT DECISION 
TO PROVIDE LIMITED LOGISTICS SUPPORT TO THE U.S.  THE 
PROCEDURES ARE (FOR CROATIA) SURPRISINGLY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND 
SHOULD PROVE SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT.  THE FEBRUARY 26 DECISION 
DID NOT AUTHORIZE TROOPS TO DISEMBARK DURING STOPS IN 
CROATIA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 26, PM RACAN\'S CABINET PASSED A DECISION 
TO AGREE TO LIMITED OVERFLIGHT, LANDING AND REFUELING FOR 
CIVILIAN CONTRACT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING U.S. FORCES FOR 
POTENTIAL ACTION IN IRAQ (REFTEL).  THE DECISION ALSO CREATED 
AN INTER-AGENCY WORKING GROUP TO ESTABLISH MODALITIES FOR

ENGAGEMENT WITH THE U.S. AND TO DRAFT STANDARD OPERATING 
PROCEDURES. 
 
3.  (C) ON MARCH 7, DAO AND EMBOFF MET WITH ASSISTANT DEFENSE 
MINISTER FOR POLICY JELENA GRCIC POLIC, THE LEADER OF THE 
WORKING GROUP.  SHE PRESENTED US WITH THE GOC\'S \"PROTOCOL FOR 
USING AIRSPACE AND AIRPORTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA FOR 
THE NEEDS OF COALITION FORCES UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\"  THE PROTOCOL (FAXED TO EUR/SCE), 
WHICH WAS REFINED IN A SERIES OF INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS, 
ESTABLISHES WHAT APPEAR TO BE REASONABLE GUIDELINES FOR 
NOTIFYING THE GOC OF UPCOMING OVERFLIGHT AND LANDING. 
 
- NO ADVANCE WARNING IS REQUIRED EXCEPT FOR A STANDARD FLIGHT 
PLAN FOR USE OF CROATIA\'S AIRSPACE BY CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT WITH 
NO INTENTION TO LAND OR REFUEL; 
 
- A MINIMUM OF 24 HOURS ADVANCE NOTICE BEFORE AIRCRAFT 
ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL IS REQUIRED FOR USE OF CROATIA\'S 
AIRPORTS FOR LANDING AND REFUELING; 
 
- CROATIA DESIGNATES ITS AIRPORTS IN SPLIT AND PULA AS 
DESIGNATED LANDING SITES, BUT OTHER AIRFIELDS MAY BE USED IN 
THE CASE OF SPECIFIED NEED. 
 
4.  (C) ASSISTANT MINISTER GRCIC POLIC EXPLAINED THAT 
ALTHOUGH THE PROTOCOL ONLY SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZES THE USE OF 
AIRPORTS BY MD-11, DC-10 AND B-767 AIRCRAFT, THE WORKING 
GROUP HAS DECIDED TO INTERPRET THIS AS \"AIRCRAFT SIMILAR TO 
THESE TYPES.\"  DISMISSING AN EARLIER POTENTIAL POINT OF 
CONTENTION, GRCIC POLIC TOLD US THAT AIRCRAFT COVERED BY THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00501  071648Z 
PROTOCOL WOULD BE AUTHORIZED USING STANDARD CIVILIAN FLIGHT 
CLEARANCES, AND WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE DESIGNATED AS \"STATE 
AIRCRAFT.\" 
 
5.  (C)  GRCIC POLIC TOLD US THAT THE PROCEDURES AS SPECIFIED 
ABOVE WERE THE MOST FLEXIBLE HER INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP 
COULD PRODUCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEBRUARY 26 DECISION; 
SOME MAY EVEN PUSH THE BOUNDARIES DEFINED BY CROATIAN LAW. 
SHE SHOWED US A COPY OF THE GOC INTERNAL STANDARD OPERATING 
PROCEDURES FOR ACTION TO BE TAKEN UPON NOTIFICATION BY THE 
USG -- THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY -- OF AN IMPENDING FLIGHT 
COVERED BY THE NEW PROTOCOL.  THE PROCEDURES APPEARED TO US 
TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND BUSINESSLIKE, PROVIDING FOR 24-HOUR 
AVAILABILITY OF RESPONSIBLE OFFICERS IN CASE OF A REQUEST 
OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS.

REF: ZAGREB 465 
 
1. SUMMARY:  INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DONORS AND THE GOC 
HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT ON A STANDARDIZED COURT AND CASE 
MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE PLATFORM THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN 
COURTS COUNTRY-WIDE. THIS NEW SYSTEM WILL IMPROVE MUCH- 
NEEDED JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE GOC 
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY SEPARATE DONOR 
INITIATIVES. THE AGREEMENT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE HIGH 
DEGREE OF COORDINATION AMONG THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
DONORS IN CROATIA.  UNDER THE AGREEMENT, USAID WILL 
MERGE THE DESIGN WORK ALREADY COMPLETED UNDER TWO 
SEPARATE PROJECTS INTO A UNIFIED SYSTEM.  SUBSEQUENTLY, 
THE WORLD BANK AND THE EU WILL ROLL OUT THE NEW 
TECHNOLOGY.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. THE NOTORIOUSLY INEFFICIENT CROATIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM 
IS ONE OF THE MAJOR DISINCENTIVES TO INVESTMENT, AND 
LAGGING REFORM IN THE SECTOR IS SEEN AS A SERIOUS 
ROADBLOCK TOWARDS EVENTUAL EU ACCESSION.  SEVERAL DONOR 
PROGRAMS ARE WORKING ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM 
WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS.  A MINISTRY OF JUSTICE 
IN DISARRAY AND WITH LITTLE COMMITMENT TO REFORM TAKES 
NO LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE REFORM PROCESS, AND IN MANY 
CASES SEEMS TO BE WORKING AGAINST IT. 
 
3. MULTI-YEAR CASE BACKLOGS ARE COMMON IN COURTS 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGE 
URBAN COURTS OF ZAGREB, SPLIT, AND RIJEKA.  THE PROBLEM 
IS BOTH LACK OF AUTOMATION (RECORDS OF CASE FILINGS ARE 
KEPT IN MULTIPLE LARGE HANDWRITTEN REGISTRY BOOKS), AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00517  01 OF 02  101514Z 
PROCEDURAL RULES THAT ALLOW FOR ENDLESS DELAYS BY THE 
PARTIES.  THE GOAL OF A USAID PROGRAM BEGUN IN 2001 WAS 
TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A NEW, MODERN COURT AND CASE 
MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SYSTEM IN THE MUNICIPAL COURTS OF 
ZAGREB, THE LARGEST GENERAL JURISDICTION COURT SYSTEM IN 
EUROPE.  THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDED THE PROCUREMENT OF 
NEW HARDWARE AS WELL AS RELATED TRAINING FOR JUDGES AND 
COURT PERSONNEL. 
 
4. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, A PARALLEL USAID PROJECT WAS 
BEGUN TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A NEW SOFTWARE SYSTEM IN 
THE COMMERCIAL COURTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  THE USAID 
PROJECT IN THE COMMERCIAL COURTS WAS DESIGNED TO WORK IN 
CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH A WORLD BANK PROJECT FOCUSING 
ON REFORM OF THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IN CROATIA.  THE 
AGREEMENT WAS THAT USAID WOULD FORM AND LEAD A WORKING 
GROUP OF COMMERCIAL COURT JUDGES TO PERFORM THE 
NECESSARY STUDY OF ALL THE PROCEDURAL RULES OF THE 
COURTS IN ORDER TO DESIGN THE SOFTWARE.  ONCE THE 
SOFTWARE SPECIFICATIONS WERE COMPLETED, THE $5 MILLION 
WORLD BANK PROJECT WOULD THEN PAY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
THE SOFTWARE AS WELL AS NEW IT HARDWARE FOR THE MAJORITY 
OF THE COMMERCIAL COURTS ACROSS CROATIA. 
 
5. AT THE TIME THESE DONOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BEGAN, 
CROATIAN LEGAL EXPERTS AND THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE WERE 
ADAMANT THAT THE PROCEDURAL RULES UNDER WHICH THE 
MUNICIPAL AND COMMERCIAL COURTS OPERATED WERE SO 
DIFFERENT THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE ONE COMMON 
COURT AND CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  BUT AS THE USAID AND 
WORLD BANK ADVISORS LED WORKING GROUPS OF MUNICIPAL AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00517  01 OF 02  101514Z 
COMMERCIAL COURT JUDGES IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE RULES AND 
PROCEDURES OF THE COURTS, IT BECAME INCREASINGLY CLEAR 
THAT THERE WAS MORE COMMONALITY THAN DIFFERENCES IN 
THEIR OPERATIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE COST AND EFFICIENCY 
ADVANTAGES OF ONE COMMON COURT AND CASE MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM FOR VIRTUALLY ALL THE COURTS IN CROATIA WERE 
CLEAR, AND FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING SUCH A SYSTEM WAS 
BECOMING MORE OBVIOUS, THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE CONTINUED 
TO INSIST ON SEPARATE SYSTEMS. 
 
6. A RECENT VISIT BY THE WORLD BANK TEAM MANAGING THE 
BANKRUPTCY PROJECT TRIGGERED THE FORMATION OF A UNITED 
DONOR POSITION ON THE ISSUE.  THE GROUP\'S HAND WAS 
STRENGTHENED BY THE EU\'S INTEREST IN INVESTING $7.5 
MILLION IN CARDS FUNDING IN COURT REFORM.  THE EU HAD 
BEEN TRYING WITH LITTLE SUCCESS TO ENGAGE THE MINISTRY 
IN DEVELOPING CONCRETE PLANS FOR THE FUNDS AND, WHEN 
APPROACHED, EU/CARDS STAFF WAS EAGER TO ADD THEIR 
LEVERAGE TO THE USAID AND WORLD BANK EFFORTS. 
 
7. THE DONORS THEN PRESENTED THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

WITH A UNITED POSITION.  ALL OF THE PREPARATORY WORK HAD 
BEEN COMPLETED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO COURT AND CASE 
MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, BUT BASED ON THAT WORK IT 
WAS NOW CLEAR THAT THE TWO SYSTEMS HAD MUCH COMMONALITY. 
THE DONORS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THE SOFTWARE BE 
WRITTEN SO THAT THE BASIC SYSTEM COULD BE USED IN ALL 
COURTS, AND ADDITIONAL MODULES BE WRITTEN TO ACCOMMODATE 
THOSE AREAS OF COURT PROCEDURES (E.G., BANKRUPTCY 
PROCEEDINGS) WHERE PROCESSES DIFFERED.  THE TWO SETS OF 
FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS WRITTEN BY THE USAID 
CONTRACTORS COULD BE RELATIVELY QUICKLY MERGED, THEIR 
AREAS OF COMMONALITY AND DIFFERENCES DEFINED, AND A 
TENDER THEN PREPARED FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.  THE EU 
SWEETENED THE OFFER WITH THE COMMITMENT TO PUT THEIR 
RESOURCES TOWARDS PAYING FOR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL 
HARDWARE TO ROLL THE SYSTEM OUT COUNTRY WIDE.  FACED 
WITH THE UNITED DONORS AND THE COMPELLING LOGIC OF THE 
PROPOSAL, THE MOJ AGREED. 
 
8. THE DONORS AND THE MINISTRY ARE IN DISCUSSIONS OVER 
THE FINAL DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT, BUT USAID HAS 
COMMITTED TO LEAD THE PROCESS OF MERGING THE TWO SETS OF 
SOFTWARE FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS.  THIS WILL TAKE 
SEVERAL MONTHS, AT WHICH POINT USAID WILL HAND OFF THE 
FINAL PRODUCT TO THE WORLD BANK TO TENDER FOR THE 
SOFTWARE.  THE WORLD BANK AND THE EU HOPE TO BEGIN THEIR 
RESPECTIVE PROCUREMENT PROCESSES FOR LARGE QUANTITIES OF 
IT HARDWARE IN THE FOLLOWING MONTHS. 
 
9. THE DECISION TO PROCEED WITH A UNIFIED SYSTEM IS A 
CLEAR WIN/WIN SITUATION.  THE CROATIAN COURTS GET A 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00517  02 OF 02  101514Z 
SINGLE COURT AND CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW 
COMMUNICATIONS AMONG ALL THE COURTS AND INVOLVE LOWER 
MAINTENANCE COSTS.  THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AVOIDS 
PAYING FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT SOFTWARE 
SYSTEM (ESTIMATED COST $800,000) AND WILL USE WORLD BANK 
LOAN FUNDS TO DEVELOP THE UNIFIED SYSTEM. 
 
10. IN THE PROCESS OF HAMMERING OUT THE DEAL, THE DONOR 
COMMUNITY HAS IMPROVED COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATIONS 
ON JUSTICE SECTOR REFORM, BOTH AMONG THE DONORS AND 
BETWEEN THE DONORS AND THE MINISTRY.  AND FINALLY, TWO 
RELATIVELY NEW AND REFORM-MINDED ASSISTANT MINISTERS IN 
THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HAVE NOW BECOME MORE ENGAGED THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROJECTS.  THERE IS STILL A LONG 
JOURNEY AHEAD ON THE ROAD TO THE REFORM OF THE CROATIAN 
JUSTICE SECTOR, BUT THIS AGREEMENT REPRESENTS A 
SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD ON THAT JOURNEY.

CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F. GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION 
------------------------ 
 
1.  (C) CROATIA\'S OPPOSITION HDZ HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO 
REHABILITATE ITSELF IN THE EYES OF VOTERS EVER SINCE IT WAS 
EJECTED FROM POWER IN JANUARY 2000.  PARTY LEADERS CLAIM -- 
LOUDLY AND OFTEN -- THAT THE HDZ IS COMPLETING ITS 
\"DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION\" FROM THE CORRUPT, NATIONALIST 
PARTY FOUNDED BY FORMER PRESIDENT TUDJMAN.  BUT BEYOND A 
STILL-INCOMPLETE POLITICAL PURGE AND THE APPLICATION OF A LOT 
OF POLISH TO ITS FACADE, THE HDZ REMAINS UNRECONSTRUCTED AND 
UNDEMOCRATIC, AND WHILE AN HDZ GOVERNMENT WOULD MOST LIKELY 
BE MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE CURRENT COALITION, IT WOULD STILL 
BE UNRELIABLE AND PROBABLY A HINDRANCE TO ACHIEVING OUR 
REGIONAL STABILITY GOALS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE. 
 
2.  (C) POLLS SHOW THAT CROATIA\'S VOTERS, APART FROM THE HDZ 
FAITHFUL, ARE STILL HESITANT TO ACCEPT HDZ PRESIDENT 
SANADER\'S DECLARATION THAT THE HDZ IS \"NEW AND IMPROVED,\" 
DESPITE THEIR FRUSTRATION WITH THE CURRENT LACKLUSTER 
COALITION.  SANADER DESPERATELY SEEKS THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY\'S VALIDATION SO HE CAN PUT TO REST THE WELL-PLACED 
FEARS OF MANY CROATIANS THAT A RETURN OF THE HDZ TO POWER 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  01 OF 05  101728Z 
WOULD HURT CROATIA\'S CHANCES TO JOIN THE EU AND NATO.  U.S. 
ACCEPTANCE OF THE HDZ AS \"NORMAL\" IS CENTRAL TO SANADER\'S 
STRATEGY.  FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, HE HAS SOUGHT TO CHANGE THE 
USG POLICY OF ONLY MEETING HIM AT THE WORKING LEVEL.  OUR 
POLICY OF KEEPING SANADER AT ARM\'S LENGTH IS WELL-KNOWN IN 
CROATIAN POLITICAL CIRCLES. 
 
3.  (C) AS THE PRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN CROATIA BEGINS TO 
WARM UP, OUR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE SANADER IS AT ITS PEAK.  ON 
FEBRUARY 21, THE AMBASSADOR MET PRIVATELY WITH SANADER FOR 
THE FIRST TIME.  A POLISHED SALESMAN CONVINCED OF THE QUALITY 
OF HIS \"PRODUCT,\" SANADER TOUTED HIS \"REFORM\" RECORD AND DID 
HIS BEST TO ESTABLISH REGULAR TIES WITH THE EMBASSY.  BUT THE 
AMBASSADOR USED THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING TO DELIVER A SHARP 
MESSAGE OF WHAT THE HDZ MUST DO BEFORE THAT TAKES PLACE. 
FROM COOPERATION WITH ICTY TO ACTIVELY SUPPORTING REFUGEE 
RETURN AND TO RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBORS IN THE REGION, THE 
AMBASSADOR LAID DOWN CLEAR EXPECTATIONS OF THE HDZ.  ON PARTY 
REFORMS, HE PRESSED SANADER TO MOVE BEYOND POLITICALLY 
EXPEDIENT PERSONNEL CHANGES AND DEMONSTRATE COMMITMENT TO 
REFORM BY ADDRESSING COMPREHENSIVELY THE HDZ\'S LEGACY OF 
CORRUPTION AND ETHNIC WAR AND BY ENSURING LOCAL HDZ LEADERS 
HEW TO A PUBLICLY-DECLARED, MORE PROGRESSIVE HDZ POLICY. 
SANADER CLAIMED HE WAS ON TRACK TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES TO 
THE HDZ AND DEMONSTRATE ITS COMMITMENT TO PROGRESS IN THE 
REGION.  WE WILL HAVE TO SEE AND INSIST ON RESULTS BEFORE WE 
GIVE HIM THE VALIDATION HE SEEKS.  OUR FIRST REAL OPPORTUNITY 
TO SEE RESULTS WILL LIKELY NOT COME BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN IS OVER.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
HDZ: HOSTAGE TO HISTORY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

4.  (C) THE CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION (HDZ) HAS FOR MOST OF 
THE PAST TWO YEARS BEEN CROATIA\'S HIGHEST-POLLING POLITICAL 
PARTY (AROUND 20 PERCENT, PLUS OR MINUS THREE).  BUT EVEN AS 
THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE FALTERED, PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE 
HDZ HAS NOT GROWN BEYOND 25 PERCENT.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT FEW 
VOTERS OUTSIDE THOSE ALWAYS FAITHFUL TO THE HDZ BRAND ARE 
READY TO TRUST THE PARTY, EVEN THREE YEARS AFTER IT WAS VOTED 
OUT.  ALTHOUGH TUDJMAN\'S HDZ SECURED CROATIA\'S FUTURE AS AN 
INDEPENDENT STATE, IT ALSO BROUGHT THE COUNTRY TO THE BRINK 
OF FINANCIAL RUIN AND INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION, LEAVING IT FAR 
BEHIND RIVALS IN THE RACE FOR THE PRIZES OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE 
EU AND NATO.  VOTERS SEEM TO REMEMBER ALL THAT. 
 
5.  (C) DURING THE TUDJMAN ERA, THE HDZ VIEWED ITSELF MORE AS 
A POLITICAL MOVEMENT THAN A POLITICAL PARTY.  ALL \"GOOD 
CROATS,\" REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL ORIENTATION, WERE 
SUPPOSED TO UNITE IN THE HDZ TO BATTLE FOR CROATIA\'S 
INDEPENDENCE AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, 
PERCEIVED OR INVENTED.  OPPOSITION TO THE HDZ WAS LABELLED AS 
\"COMMUNIST\" AND LEADERS CALLING FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION WERE 
ACCUSED OF TRYING TO RECONSTITUTE YUGOSLAVIA.  THIS 
SIMPLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICS PERSISTS IN SOME 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUBJECT: SANADER\'S HDZ: RATINGS UP, BUT STILL NOT READY FOR 
PRIME TIME 
 
OBSERVERS, AND CAN STILL BE SEEN IN HARDLINE COMMENTARY LIKE 
THAT OF \"WASHINGTON TIMES\" COLUMNIST JEFFREY KUHNER.  HDZ 
PRESIDENT IVO SANADER HAS, SINCE HE WAS FIRST ELECTED AS 
PARTY PRESIDENT AFTER THE HDZ\'S CRUSHING ELECTORAL DEFEAT IN 
JANUARY 2000, SOUGHT TO RE-MAKE HIS PARTY AS A \"NORMAL\" 
CENTER-RIGHT POLITICAL OPTION.  BUT IN HIS FIRST TERM AS HDZ 
PRESIDENT, SANADER MADE CHANGES ONLY TO THE PARTY\'S IMAGE, 
BLAMING STRONG INTERNAL OPPOSITION FROM RIVAL AND TOP TUDJMAN 
HENCHMAN IVIC PASALIC. 
 
CLEANING HOUSE AND SETTLING POLITICAL ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.  (C) WHEN SANADER DEFEATED PASALIC AND WAS RE-ELECTED TO 
THE PARTY PRESIDENCY IN APRIL 2002, HE BEGAN A SERIES OF 
POLITICAL PURGES IN THE HDZ TO ROOT OUT THOSE SENIOR MEMBERS 
AT THE CENTRAL AND LOCAL LEVELS STILL LOYAL TO PASALIC.  THIS 
CULMINATED IN THE EJECTION OF PASALIC LATER IN 2002 AND OF 
SEVERAL LOCAL PARTY COMMITTEES THAT WOULD NOT TOE THE LINE. 
BUT WHILE MOST OF THOSE WHO FOLLOWED PASALIC OUT THE DOOR (OR 
WERE PUSHED OUT) WERE FROM THE HDZ\'S MOST EXTREME NATIONALIST 
WING, THE PURGES WERE CONDUCTED SOLELY FOR REASONS OF LOYALTY 
TO SANADER\'S LEADERSHIP, NOT IDEOLOGY.  MANY OF THE HDZ\'S 
NATIONALIST DINOSAURS REMAIN WITH SANADER. 
 
HDZ\'S SIGHTS SET ON NEXT ELECTION 
--------------------------------- 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  02 OF 05  101729Z 
 
7.  (C) WITH HIS INTERNAL BATTLES BEHIND HIM AND THE SUPPORT 
OF A FEW SLICK, MODERN POLITICAL OPERATORS (LIKE FORMER 
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. MIOMIR ZUZUL AND HDZ VICE PRESIDENT 
JADRANKA KOSOR), SANADER NOW HAS HIS SIGHTS FIRMLY ON THE 
NEXT ELECTIONS.  WITH THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT FLOUNDERING FROM 
CRISIS TO CRISIS (MOST CREATED BY THEIR OWN INTERNAL 
BICKERING), THE HDZ OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A COMMANDING 
LEAD IN THE POLLS. 
 
8.  (C) HOWEVER, THE HDZ CONTINUES TO POLL IN THE RANGE OF 23 
PERCENT, AHEAD OF PM RACAN\'S SDP, BUT STUBBORNLY FAR BELOW 
THE LEVEL REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN BY ITSELF.  SANADER\'S 
TASK IS SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND, BUT HARD TO ACHIEVE: TO RETURN 
TO GOVERNMENT, THE HDZ NEEDS EITHER TO CONVINCE MORE VOTERS 
TO BACK HIS PARTY OR TO CONVINCE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES THAT 
HIS HDZ WOULD BE A TRUSTWORTHY PARTNER IN COALITION.  AND HE 
HAS TO DO THIS WHILE KEEPING THE NATIONALIST RIGHT-WING CORE 
OF HIS HDZ FIRMLY IN HIS CAMP. 
 
HDZ NEEDS USG SEAL OF APPROVAL TO CONVINCE UNDECIDEDS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
9.  (C) ONE RECENT RELIABLE POLL SHOWS THAT NEARLY 40 PERCENT 
OF THOSE WHO INTEND TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTION HAVE NOT 
MADE UP THEIR MINDS.  SANADER BELIEVES CROATIA\'S UNDECIDED 
VOTERS ARE LOOKING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO JUDGE 
WHETHER THE HDZ HAS BECOME A PARTY CAPABLE OF GOVERNING THEIR 
COUNTRY OUTSIDE OF WARTIME.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE KONRAD 
ADENAUER FOUNDATION AND SOME CONSERVATIVE EU PARTIES 
AFFILIATED WITH THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY, OTHER IC LEADERS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00519  02 OF 05  101729Z 
HAVE TAKEN THE SAME LINE AS WE HAVE, KEEPING THE HDZ AT ARM\'S 
LENGTH UNTIL IT DEMONSTRATES -- ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER, 
NOT JUST PERSONNEL -- THAT IT HAS CHANGED. 
 
10.  (C) WE HAD BEEN WEIGHING FOR SOME TIME A MEETING WITH 
SANADER TO EXPLAIN WHERE THE HDZ NEEDS TO CHANGE; AS THE 
PRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN CROATIA BEGINS TO WARM UP, OUR 
ABILITY TO INFLUENCE SANADER IS AT ITS PEAK.  THERE IS ALSO 
LESS TO LOSE: AS THE COALITION PARTIES ARE INCREASINGLY 
SEIZED WITH ELECTIONS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALL BUT STOPPED 
TAKING UNPOPULAR STEPS ON SOME OF THE ISSUES WE CONSIDER MOST 
IMPORTANT, LIKE REFUGEE RETURN. 
 
11.  (C) SANADER\'S RECENT CLEAR AND POSITIVE STATEMENTS ON 
IRAQ INFLUENCED THE TIMING OF OUR MEETING, WHICH WAS TAKEN 
(AS INTENDED) BY THE GOC AS A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOW.  OUR AIM 
WAS TO PROD PM RACAN INTO TAKING A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE LINE ON 
PROVIDING LOGISTICS SUPPORT TO CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT CARRYING 
U.S. TROOPS TO THE MIDEAST.  ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS OF THE 
MEETING WITH SANADER REMAIN OUT OF THE PRESS -- AS AGREED -- 
WE LEAKED NEWS OF THE MEETING TO THE SDP, EXPLAINING THAT THE 
HDZ\'S STANCE SUPPORTING USG CALLS FOR ACTION ON IRAQ WAS ONE 
OF THE REASONS.  PM RACAN ANNOUNCED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION 
TO APPROVE USG LOGISTICS REQUESTS SOON AFTER.  RACAN REFERRED 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUBJECT: SANADER\'S HDZ: RATINGS UP, BUT STILL NOT READY FOR 
PRIME TIME 
 
INDIRECTLY TO THIS SANADER MEETING TO THE AMBASSADOR WHEN HE 
INFORMED THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE GOC WOULD APPROVE THE USE OF 
CROATIAN AIRSPACE AND AIRFIELDS (ZAGREB 409). 
 
12.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 21, THE AMBASSADOR MET PRIVATELY WITH 
SANADER AT THE RESIDENCE.  THE AMBASSADOR OPENED THE MEETING 
BY THANKING SANADER FOR HIS STRONG STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
THE USG POSITION ON IRAQ.  SANADER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR 
CONVINCINGLY THAT THIS WAS NOT JUST HIS, BUT HIS PARTY\'S 
POSITION, TAKEN NOT TO GAIN FAVOR WITH THE U.S., BUT BECAUSE 
THE HDZ BELIEVES IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.  HE KNOWS THE 
POSITION RUNS AGAINST PUBLIC OPINION.  THE AMBASSADOR 
EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR SANADER\'S VIEW, BUT UNDERSCORED 
THAT IRAQ IS IN A CATEGORY OF ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE ABOVE 
POLITICS.  WE HAD INTERPRETED THE HDZ\'S FEBRUARY 19 VOTE 
AGAINST THE GOC DECISION TO SUPPORT THE VILNIUS-10 DECISION 
IN A SABOR COMMITTEE AS PLAYING POLITICS WITH THE ISSUE. 
SANADER WAS DEFENSIVE, SAYING THAT THE COMMITTEE VOTE WAS NOT 
ON THE POLICY, PER SE, BUT TO APPROVE A GOVERNMENT REPORT 
ABOUT THE POLICY, A REPORT WITH WHICH HIS PARTY DID NOT FULLY 
AGREE SINCE IT FELT THE GOC WAS MISHANDLING THE IRAQ ISSUE. 
 
AMB: NO BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT FOR HDZ 
------------------------------------ 
 
13.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THEN DESCRIBED FOR SANADER WHY HE HAS 
BEEN HESITANT TO ENGAGE WITH THE HDZ AND WHY THE USG WILL NOT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  03 OF 05  101729Z 
TAKE HIS PARTY\'S ASSERTIONS AT FACE VALUE.  WE HAVE A LONG 
MEMORY.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT HE PERSONALLY WAS INVOLVED 
IN SOUTH CENTRAL EUROPE WHEN THE POLICIES THE HDZ GOVERNMENT 
WAS IMPLEMENTING WERE WORKING IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO U.S. 
GOALS FOR REGIONAL STABILITY IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.  THE 
HDZ GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN USEFUL TO US ON SOME FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
ISSUES, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO SUPPORTING NATO AIR WAR 
AGAINST THE FRY, BUT ON ALMOST EVERY OTHER ISSUE -- FOR 
EXAMPLE THE TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT\'S DISRUPTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH 
CROATS IN BOSNIA, ITS ACTIVE OBSTRUCTION OF THE RETURN OF 
ETHNIC SERBS TO THEIR HOMES IN CROATIA, ITS OBSTRUCTION OF 
COOPERATION WITH ICTY AND, OF COURSE, ITS PERVASIVE 
CORRUPTION AND CRONY CAPITALISM -- THE HDZ HAD BEEN ON THE 
WRONG SIDE.  THIS HISTORY WOULD CONTINUE TO COLOR THE 
EMBASSY\'S RECOMMENDATION TO WASHINGTON ON HOW TO ENGAGE WITH 
THE HDZ. 
 
FINISH YOUR \"PURGE\" -- GET RID OF GLAVAS AND ROJS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
14.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER THAT WE HAD BEEN 
FOLLOWING THE PERSONNEL CHANGES IN HDZ CLOSELY.  WHILE THE 
DEPARTURE OF PASALIC AND SOME OF HIS CLOSEST ASSOCIATES WAS A 
GOOD THING, THERE WAS MUCH MORE HOUSECLEANING TO DO.  RETIRED 
GENERAL LJUBO CESIC-ROJS IS A CARICATURE OF THE TUDJMAN HDZ, 
STILL TRYING TO DISGUISE HIS SMUGGLING AND ILLEGAL GAINS WITH 
PATRIOTIC STATEMENTS AND WITH ONE FOOT IN HERZEGOVINA.  WORSE 
STILL, OSIJEK STRONGMAN BRANIMIR GLAVAS, WAS STILL ONE OF 
SANADER\'S MOST TRUSTED ADVISERS.  (INDEED, MANY ARGUE THAT 
GLAVAS\' VOTE-RIGGING AT THE LAST HDZ CONVENTION KEPT SANADER 
IN CONTROL OF THE PARTY.)  THE AMBASSADOR RECALLED IN DETAIL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00519  03 OF 05  101729Z 
GLAVAS\' ROLE IN CLOSE LEAGUE WITH FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER 
SUSAK THAT HELPED SPARK WAR IN 1991 IN THE MURDER OF OSIJEK 
POLICE CHIEF RIEHL-KIR AND THE BOROVO SELO ATTACK.  AS LONG 
AS GLAVAS WAS IN THE HDZ, THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER, WE 
WOULD NOT TAKE IT (OR HIM) SERIOUSLY. 
 
NO ROOM FOR POLITICAL MANEUVER ON COOPERATION WITH ICTY 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
15.  (C) ON ICTY COOPERATION, THE AMBASSADOR SAID THERE IS NO 
ROOM FOR COMPROMISE.  IF THE HDZ WANTS THE RESPECT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, IT MUST SHOW RESPECT TO ITS 
INSTITUTIONS.  IF THE HDZ EXPECTS TO BE ACCEPTED AS A 
RESPONSIBLE PARTY, THEN ITS LEADER MAY NOT SAY THAT IF IN 
GOVERNMENT HE WOULD SEEK TO RE-OPEN CROATIA\'S LAW ON 
COOPERATION WITH ICTY WHEN HE COMES TO POWER.  NO HDZ LEADER 
CAN EXPECT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY THE U.S. AS A REFORMER IF 
HE BASES HIS CAMPAIGN ON THE \"WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP OUR 
GENERALS\" THEME.  WHEN THE NEXT INDICTMENT COMES DOWN FROM 
THE TRIBUNAL, THE AMBASSADOR CONTINUED, CROATIA\'S RESPONSIBLE 
POLITICAL LEADERS MUST CALL FOR WHOMEVER IS INDICTED TO GO TO 
THE HAGUE OR BE TRANSFERRED PROMPTLY. 
 
HDZ SHOULD PUT ITS MONEY WHERE ITS MOUTH IS ON RETURNS

PRIME TIME 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
16.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER THAT REFUGEE RETURN AND 
REINTEGRATION IS AN ISSUE WHERE THE HDZ CAN SHOW WHETHER IT 
IS REFORMED WITHOUT WAITING FOR ELECTIONS.  HE CALLED ON 
SANADER TO BACK UP HIS POSITIVE PRIVATE STATEMENTS WELCOMING 
RETURN WITH PUBLIC POLICY STATEMENTS TO PARTY MEMBERS, 
INSISTING THAT THEY ENCOURAGE LAWFUL RETURN.  THE AMBASSADOR 
URGED SANADER TO CALL ON HDZ MAYORS AND COUNTY PREFECTS TO 
COOPERATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
TO FACILITATE REFUGEE RETURN.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT 
THAT SOME HDZ OFFICIALS, EVEN IN AREAS WHERE THE EFFECTS OF 
THE WAR ARE STILL STRONGLY FELT, ARE SUPPORTING RETURNS; THE 
USG IS PLEASED TO HAVE ENTERED INTO SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME MUNICIPALITIES WHERE HDZ HOLDS A 
MAJORITY.  IN THE FIELD, READINESS TO MOVE FORWARD IS A MORE 
IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR SELECTION IN THESE PROGRAMS THAN PARTY 
AFFILIATION, THE AMBASSADOR SAID.  BUT THE WORST 
OBSTRUCTIONIST MAYORS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY HDZ.  SANADER 
NEEDED TO LEAD HIS PARTY TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE EVERYWHERE IT 
GOVERNED. 
 
SANADER: \"HEY, WE\'RE NOT ALL BAD\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
17.  (C) SANADER THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS FRANK 
MESSAGES; HE SAID HE GENUINELY APPRECIATED THE USG\'S 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  04 OF 05  101730Z 
UNVARNISHED VIEW OF WHERE THE HDZ STOOD.  WHILE HE 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE HDZ HAS ITS \"WARTS,\" SANADER SAID HE IS 
NEVERTHELESS PROUD OF HIS PARTY.  PRESIDENT TUDJMAN WAS A 
STATESMAN WHOSE CONTRIBUTION WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY HISTORY. 
SANADER SAID HE KNOWS HIS PARTY\'S TRANSFORMATION IS 
INCOMPLETE; THE HDZ STILL HAS A WAYS TO GO BEFORE IT BECOMES 
THE RESPONSIBLE, CENTER-RIGHT PARTY HE HOPES TO CREATE. 
 
18.  (C) HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT WHEN HE WAS ELECTED 
PARTY PRESIDENT IN APRIL 2000, IT WAS STILL TUDJMAN\'S HDZ 
THAT HE TOOK OVER, VERY MUCH A WARTIME PARTY.  DESPITE 
PASALIC\'S DEPARTURE WITH A FEW OF HIS FAITHFUL, THE 
PARLIAMENTARY CAUCUS WAS AND IS STILL FULL OF \"LITTLE 
TUDJMANS,\" MANY OF WHOM DO NOT SHARE THE IDEOLOGY OF THE 
PARTY SANADER SEEKS TO DEVELOP.  UNTIL THESE PEOPLE LEAVE THE 
PARTY, THE HDZ WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE MANY OF THE 
CHARACTERISTICS OF A NATIONAL MOVEMENT RATHER THAN A 
MAINSTREAM POLITICAL PARTY. 
 
19.  (C) SANADER HOPES TO ADDRESS THE HDZ\'S LACK OF TOLERANCE 
AND TRANSPARENCY BY CHANGING THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE 
PARTY WITH MORE PROGRESSIVE, YOUNGER PARTY MEMBERS.  WITH THE 
WIN OVER PASALIC IN 2002, SANADER CLAIMED HE NOW HAS COMPLETE 
CONTROL OF THE NATIONAL LEVEL ELECTORAL LISTS.  HE 
\"GUARANTEED\" THE AMBASSADOR THAT FULLY 80 PERCENT OF THE 
CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY CAUCUS WOULD BE OUT OF THE SABOR AFTER 
THE NEXT ELECTION.  HE CLAIMED THAT ROJS WAS ALREADY ON THE 
WAY OUT.  HE DID NOT TAKE ON THE AMBASSADOR\'S DENUNCIATION OF 
GLAVAS BY NAME, BUT ARGUED THAT EASTERN SLAVONIA (LITERALLY, 
GLAVAS\' STOMPING GROUND) IS A \"DIFFICULT\" AREA WHERE \"THERE 
ARE STILL MANY WAR WOUNDS.\"  ON RETURNS, SANADER CLAIMED THAT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00519  04 OF 05  101730Z 
HIS PARTY\'S POLICY IS THAT ALL WHO WISH TO RETURN SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO DO SO.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT 
ADDRESSED IN A UNIFORM WAY BY HDZ LOCAL LEADERS.  SANADER 
EXPLAINED THAT ONE OF THE WAYS HE IS \"DEMOCRATIZING\" THE HDZ 
IS TO PUSH RESPONSIBILITY FOR ISSUES DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL; 
IN DOING SO HE GIVES UP A MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER LOCAL 
OFFICIALS\' BEHAVIOR. 
 
20.  (C) NEVERTHELESS, SANADER POINTED OUT THE HDZ HAS 
RECENTLY TAKEN SOME POLICY POSITIONS WHICH SHOW PROGRESS.  HE 
TOOK CREDIT FOR THE HDZ\'S SUBSTANTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO 
CROATIA\'S PROGRESSIVE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL 
MINORITIES, FOR ITS VOTE IN THE SABOR TO APPROVE THE 
DEPLOYMENT OF A CROATIAN MILITARY POLICE UNIT TO AFGHANISTAN 
AND HIS PARTY\'S PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S LAUNCH OF 
CROATIA\'S APPLICATION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP. 
 
21.  (C) SANADER SAID HE WAS PROUD OF THE HDZ RECORD IN 
SUPPORTING CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH CROATIA\'S NEIGHBORS. 
THE HDZ HAS BROKEN TIES WITH THE HDZ-BIH, HE ASSERTED, AND 
SUPPORTED THE GOC POLICY OF PROPER STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONS. 
HE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK HARDER TO RESOLVE 
OUTSTANDING BORDER ISSUES WITH SERBIA-MONTENEGRO.  SANADER 
SAID HE UNDERSTANDS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BORDER ISSUES (HE

SUBJECT: SANADER\'S HDZ: RATINGS UP, BUT STILL NOT READY FOR 
PRIME TIME 
 
MENTIONED THAT HE HAD ALREADY MET WITH THE SERBIA-MONTENEGRO 
AMBASSADOR TO CROATIA), BUT ARGUED THAT WHILE IT MAY TAKE 
TIME TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES, IT ALSO TAKES LEADERSHIP, 
LARGELY ABSENT IN THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.  (IN A LATER 
MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, S-M AMBASSADOR SIMURDIC 
CHARACTERIZED HIS MEETING WITH SANADER IN LESS POSITIVE 
TERMS.) 
 
22.  (C) SANADER WAS EAGER TO SET A DATE FOR A FUTURE MEETING 
WITH THE AMBASSADOR, AND SAID HE WOULD AGREE ON ANY TERMS 
PROPOSED.  HE ALSO SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH MORE REGULAR CONTACT 
WITH THE EMBASSY.  ON THE ISSUE OF REFUGEE RETURN, HE 
PROPOSED SETTING UP A WORKING GROUP OF EXPERTS FROM THE HDZ 
AND THE EMBASSY TO DISCUSS WAYS TO MOVE THE ISSUE FORWARD. 
THE AMBASSADOR PARRIED THE IDEA OF WORKING GROUPS ON THIS 
ISSUE AND ON ICTY, PREFERRING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE 
HDZ\'S \"REFORM\" AND THEN SEEK TO ENGAGE WITH SANADER FOR 
FUTURE MEETINGS BASED ON THE PARTY\'S FORWARD PROGRESS. 
 
23.  (C)  BY AND LARGE, SANADER STUCK TO THE \"NO PRESS\" 
GROUND RULES SET UP IN ADVANCE, ALTHOUGH OUR BACK-CHANNEL 
MESSAGE (SEE PARA 11 ABOVE) DID GENERATE SOME PRESS INTEREST 
ABOUT A \"SECRET\" MEETING BETWEEN SANADER AND AN EMBASSY 
\"SENIOR OFFICIAL.\"  SANADER PUBLISHED A MAJOR INTERVIEW ON 
MARCH 1 IN WHICH HE ADDRESSED SOME OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S 
CONCERNS, BUT MISSED IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DEMONSTRATE 
HIS PARTY\'S COMMITMENT TO THE GOALS OUTLINED BY THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00519  05 OF 05  101730Z 
AMBASSADOR DURING THEIR MEETING.  AS HE HAS IN THE PAST, HE 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE HDZ\'S FAILURE TO CURB RAMPANT CORRUPTION 
DURING THE TUDJMAN REGIME.  ON ICTY, HE SPOKE OUT OF BOTH 
SIDES OF HIS MOUTH IN THE SAME INTERVIEW.  WHILE HE SAID THAT 
\"ALL UN MEMBER STATES MUST COOPERATE WITH THE TRIBUNAL\" AND 
VOWED TO USE LEGAL CHALLENGES WHICH CROATIA HAS A RIGHT TO 
PURSUE, HE \"REJECTED THE UNACCEPTABLE POLITICAL 
QUALIFICATIONS\" IN THE GOTOVINA INDICTMENT AND DECLARED THAT 
THE HDZ WOULD STICK TO THIS POSITION.  (TO BE FAIR, THE GOC 
DOES LITTLE BETTER.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
24.  (C) SANADER, CLEARLY ONE OF CROATIA\'S NATURAL SALESMEN, 
STRIKES US AS PERSONALLY GENUINE, BUT IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT 
HE IS NOT COMMITTED TO ANYTHING BUT RETURNING THE HDZ TO 
GOVERNMENT.  SANADER KNOWS THAT HIS ACHILLES\' HEEL IS THE 
ABILITY OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS IN THE CURRENT COALITION TO 
CONVINCE CROATIANS THAT A VOTE FOR THE HDZ IS A VOTE AGAINST 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU.  THAT MEANS THIS PRE-ELECTION PERIOD IS 
OUR BEST OPPORTUNITY TO GET SANADER AT LEAST TO MAKE 
STATEMENTS (EVEN IF ACTIONS WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT) 
IN SUPPORT OF OUR REGIONAL STABILITY GOALS. 
 
25.  (C) OUR MEETING WITH SANDER DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE 
ANY CLOSER TO RECOGNIZING THE HDZ AS A VIABLE DEMOCRATIC 
OPTION FOR CROATIA.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS POINT 
PRIVATELY TO OTHER POLITICAL LEADERS IN CROATIA.  OUR 
RAMPED-UP ELECTION-YEAR DEMOCRACY-BUILDING ASSISTANCE 
CONTINUES TO BE AIMED AT SUPPORTING THE HDZ\'S POTENTIAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

OPPONENTS BY HELPING THEM IDENTIFY RESONANT CAMPAIGN THEMES 
AND BY GETTING OUT THE VOTE -- EVERY VOTER WHO NEEDS TO BE 
GOTTEN OUT IS A COALITION VOTER; HDZ IS A SOLID BLOC. 
 
26.  (C) THE NEXT STEP IS UP TO SANADER\'S HDZ.  WE SET CLEAR 
BENCHMARKS.  SANADER\'S COMMITMENT TO REFORM BOTH ON POLICY 
ISSUES AND ON TRANSFORMING THE HDZ INTO A DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY TO GAUGE, BOTH BY HIS PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS AND IN THE CANDIDATES THE HDZ PUTS UP FOR THE NEXT 
ELECTION.  FOR CROATIA TO BECOME A FULLY FUNCTIONAL 
DEMOCRACY, THE HDZ NEEDS TO BECOME A NORMAL POLITICAL PARTY 
WHICH VOTERS COULD CHOOSE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT 
LINEUP.  THIS MEETING WAS A FIRST SERIOUS EFFORT TO ENGAGE 
AND TEST SANADER\'S WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO EFFECT THAT 
CHANGE.  WE REMAIN FROM MISSOURI AS TO THE CHANGES HE WILL DO 
SO.

                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00523  01 OF 02  111302Z 
MINISTERS MET BRIEFLY IN DUBROVNIK MARCH 7 TO CONFIRM THE 
\"ADRIATIC CHARTER\" DRAFT TEXT (ALREADY WITH DEPARTMENT), 
ISSUE A DECLARATION AND GIVE THE INITIATIVE HIGHER PUBLIC 
PROFILE.  AMBASSADOR ROSSIN ATTENDED FOR THE  USG AT FM 
PICULA\'S INVITATION AND PARTICIPATED IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE 
AFTERWARD.  TEXT OF MINISTERS\' DECLARATION, WITH REASONABLY 
FIRM IRAQ LANGUAGE, AT PARA 9 (FAXED TO EUR/SCE).  WE CREDIT 
ALBANIAN FM META FOR ENSURING THE IRAQ LANGUAGE WAS INCLUDED 
IN THE FINAL TEXT.  ALTHOUGH THE CROATIANS POSE LESS 
RESISTANCE THAN AT PREVIOUS A3 MEETINGS, AMBASSADOR OVERHEARD 
THE CROATIAN LEAD OFFICIALS TRYING TO MINIMIZE IT. 
 
2.  (C)  IN THE CONFERENCE AND AT THE PRESS EVENT, ALL THREE 
MINISTERS STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF, AND THEIR GRATITUDE 
FOR, USG \"PARTNERSHIP\" IN ADVANCING THEIR NATO ASPIRATIONS, 
AND UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADRIATIC CHARTER AS 
PROOF POSITIVE OF OUR COMMITMENT.  ALL LOOKED FORWARD TO 
SIGNING WITH SECRETARY POWELL IN WASHINGTON. PER REF A, 
AMBASSADOR TOLD THE MINISTERS THAT A SIGNING CEREMONY IN 
MARCH WAS UNLIKELY AND NOTED THAT THE CHARTER TEXT WAS UNDER 
REVIEW IN WASHINGTON, WITH SOME WORDING CHANGES POSSIBLE 
SOON.  THE MINISTERS UNDERSTOOD THAT MARCH WAS HARD TO 
PROGRAM BUT URGED THAT SIGNING NOT BE ALLOWED TO SLIP TOO 
LONG.  PER REF B, DEPARTMENT\'S PROPOSED CHANGES IN CHARTER 
WORDING SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE THREE WASHINGTON 
AMBASSADORS FOR A3 CONSIDERATION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) THE FOREIGN MINISTERS A3 MEETING MARCH 7 IN DUBROVNIK 
LASTED 45 MINUTES, WITH AMBASSADOR ROSSIN INVITED TO JOIN IN 
ALL BUT THE FIRST TEN MINUTES.  DISCUSSION DURING THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S PRESENCE WAS RATHER PERFUNCTORY (THE DECLARATION 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00523  01 OF 02  111302Z 
AND DRAFT CHARTER HAVING BEEN COMPLETED BEFOREHAND) WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF MINOR TENSION WHEN ALBANIAN FM META COMPLAINED 
TO CROATIAN FM PICULA ABOUT TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON ALBANIANS 
COMING TO CROATIA.  PICULA DWELT ON CROATIA\'S NATO AND EU 
ASPIRATIONS AND PROGRESS AND STRESSED ITS INTEREST IN 
REGIONAL COOPERATION.  MACEDONIAN FM MITREVA EMPHASIZED 
PRACTICAL COOPERATION, MENTIONED IN THE ADRIATIC CHARTER, ON 
ISSUES SUCH AS BORDER SECURITY, TRAFFICKING AND ECONOMIC 
COOPERATION.  SHE TOUTED THE MAY BORDER CONFERENCE IN OHRID 
(SKOPJE 313). 
 
4. (C) META SIMILARLY STRESSED ALBANIA\'S INTEREST IN REGIONAL 
COOPERATION BUT ALSO NOTED THE NEED FOR DEVELOPMENT 
ASSISTANCE SO THESE COUNTRIES COULD ATTAIN NATO AND EU 
STANDARDS IN A REASONABLE TIME.  META EMPHASIZED AT LENGTH 
ALBANIAN SOLIDARITY WITH THE U.S. ON IRAQ, COMPARING SADDAM\'S 
REGIME WITH THE SOCIALIST ISOLATION HIS COUNTRY SUFFERED FOR 
50 YEARS.  ALL THREE MINISTERS WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO 
UNDERSCORE THEIR APPRECIATION FOR USG SUPPORT, NOT ONLY ON 
THE ADRIATIC CHARTER, THE OPEN DOOR AND THEIR NATO 
CANDIDACIES, BUT ALSO ON THE FULL RANGE OF THEIR ASPIRATIONS 
AND CHALLENGES. 
 
5. (C) AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED IN HIS TURN U.S. COMMITMENT TO 
THE OPEN DOOR AND TO ASSIST THE THREE COUNTRIES IN MAKING 
THEIR NATO ASPIRATIONS REAL THROUGH THEIR MAP PROGRAMS. 
WHILE EACH COUNTRY FACED DIFFERENT DEFENSE REFORMS, 
INTEROPERABILITY AND CIVIL SOCIETY CHALLENGES TO QUALIFY FOR 
INVITATIONS, NATO WAS ALL ABOUT COLLABORATION, AND THEREFORE 
WE APPLAUDED THEIR INITIATIVE IN TEAMING TOGETHER THROUGH 
THIS ADRIATIC PROCESS, NOT JUST WITH HORTATORY LANGUAGE BUT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00523  01 OF 02  111302Z 
WITH CONCRETE PLANS.  AMBASSADOR TOLD THE MINISTERS THAT THE 
DRAFT CHARTER TEXT WAS BEING REVIEWED IN WASHINGTON AND WE 
APPLAUDED ITS OVERALL TONE AND PROVISIONS; WE EXPECTED TO 
PROPOSE SOME MINOR WORDING CHANGES IN DUE COURSE.  ALTHOUGH 
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM A WASHINGTON SIGNING DATE YET AND 
MARCH LOOKED UNLIKELY, WE WOULD BE IN TOUCH SOON AND REMAINED 
COMMITTED TO AN EARLY SIGNING CEREMONY. 
 
6. (C) FINALLY, WHILE NOTING THAT THE USG WOULD WELCOME THE 
ADRIATIC INITIATIVE AND DUBROVNIK DECLARATION AS A WHOLE, WE 
ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED THE DECLARATION\'S REITERATION OF 
IRAQ\'S OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH UNSCR 1441 \"OR FACE THE 
CONSEQUENCES.\"  SUCH SOLIDARITY WAS ESSENTIAL TO MAXIMIZE 
PRESSURE ON SADDAM TO COMPLY AND AVOID THE NEED FOR USE OF 
FORCE TO DISARM IRAQ. 
 
7. (C) THE MINISTERS UNDERSTOOD THE UNCERTAINTY IN SCHEDULING 
THE WASHINGTON SIGNING CEREMONY BUT URGED THAT IT NOT BE 
DELAYED TOO LONG.  MACEDONIAN FM MITREVA WAS STRONGEST ON 
THIS POINT; SHE INDICATED SHE HAD HEARD THAT DELAY UNTIL MAY 
WAS BEING CONSIDERED AND SAID THAT WOULD DISSIPATE THE 
PROGRESS MADE BY THE THREE.  AMBASSADOR ASSURED HER WE WOULD 
MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SCHEDULE THE SIGNING CEREMONY AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE AND DISCOUNTED WHAT SHE HAD HEARD.

MARCH 14.  PICULA WAS NON-COMMITTAL, BUT AGAIN POINTED TO THE 
DIFFICULTY OF PROVIDING A HOLD HARMLESS IN THE ABSENCE OF A 
RATIFIED SUCCESSION AGREEMENT.  AS HE HAS IN PREVIOUS 
MEETINGS WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER, THE 
AMBASSADOR STRESSED SEVERAL TIMES THAT PROVIDING A HOLD 
HARMLESS AGREEMENT WOULD NOT PREJUDICE CROATIA\'S CASE WITH 
RESPECT TO THE ASI.  IN THE ABSENCE OF A HOLD HARMLESS, 
HOWEVER, CROATIA STOOD TO LOSE ALMOST $52 MILLION. 
 
2.   (C) THE AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED THE APRIL 15 DEADLINE IN 
THE DEMARCHE, BUT NOTED THAT ANY DECISION SHOULD COME 
SUFFICIENTLY IN ADVANCE TO GIVE TIME TO REVIEW THEIR 
POSITIONS TO OTHER SUCCESSOR STATES WHO HAVE BEEN TAKING 
THEIR LEAD FROM THE GOC.

CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC OFFICER ISABELLA DETWILER, REASONS 1.5 (B AND D 
) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) THERE IS NO REAL CONSENSUS ON HOW HOSTILITIES IN 
IRAQ COULD HURT THE CROATIAN ECONOMY.  THE LOCAL MEDIA IS 
FULL OF SPECULATION, HOWEVER, AND THE COMMENTARY AND 
\"ANALYIS\" OFTEN BETRAY FAMILIAR -- ANTI-WAR -- BIASES. 
TOURISM IS THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF FOREIGN REVENUE FOR 
CROATIA, AND CONTRIBUTES ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF THE GDP.  MOST 
BELIEVE THAT HOSTILITIES IN THE GULF WOULD NOT DIRECTLY 
AFFECT CROATIAN TOURISM.  THERE ARE EVEN SOME WHO BELIEVE 
HOSTILITIES WOULD HELP CROATIA BY KEEPING EUROPEAN TOURISTS, 
AFRAID TO TRAVEL FAR, CLOSE TO HOME AND ON CROATIAN BEACHES. 
HOWEVER, A TERRORIST ACT IN EUROPE -- OR WORSE, IN CROATIA 
ITSELF  -- COULD HAVE A DISASTEROUS NEGATIVE EFFECT ON 
TOURISM AND THE ECONOMY. 
 
2.  (SBU) MOST LOCAL ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT, WHILE A 
PROLONGED PERIOD OF HIGHER OIL PRICES WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY 
HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY, A SHORT BUMP-UP IN PRICES 
WOULD HAVE ONLY A MARGINAL EFFECT.  PRE-WAR JITTERS MAY ALSO 
HAVE A HARD-TO-MEASURE EFFECT ON CONSUMPTION AND EXPORTS.

END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------- 
EFFECT ON TOURISM 
----------------- 
 
3.  (U) THE HEAD OF THE CROATIAN EMPLOYERS\' ASSOCIATION 
SPECULATED THAT, IF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM OCCURRED ANYWHERE 
IN EUROPE, TOURISM IN CROATIA COULD SUFFER.  HE CITED AS AN 
EXTREME EXAMPLE THE SITUATION A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THE NATO 
CAMPAIGN OVER NEARBY KOSOVO WAS LAUNCHED AND WESTERN EUROPEAN 
COMPANIES SHUNNED CROATIA AS PART OF AN \"UNSTABLE AREA.\" 
CRUISE SHIPS HAD PROBLEMS SECURING INSURANCE FOR ENTERING A 
SUPPOSED WAR ZONE. 
 
4   (C) REVENUES FROM TOURISM ACCOUNTED FOR 18-20 PERCENT OF 
CROATIA\'S GDP IN 2002.  DESPITE UNCERTAINTIES OVER IRAQ, 
INITIAL BOOKINGS FOR THE 2003 SEASON HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT. 
ADDITIONAL BORDER CONTROLS COULD SLOW DOWN TRAVEL VIA 
PERSONAL VEHICLES, WHICH IS HOW MOST TOURISTS COME TO 
CROATIA.  HOWEVER, \"TIGHTER BORDER CONTROLS\" HAVE SUPPOSEDLY 
BEEN IN PLACE SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, WITH LITTLE OBVIOUS ADVERSE 
EFFECT.  NAYSAYERS SPECULATE THAT ALLOWING FOR PASSAGE OF 
COALITION AIRCRAFT COULD ALTER FLIGHT SCHEDULES, AND AIRFARES 
COULD INCREASE IF INSURANCE FEES GO UP. 
 
5.  (U) THEN THERE IS THE OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW.  MINISTER 
OF ECONOMY LJUBO JURCIC RECENTLY SAID IN AN INTERVIEW WITH 
BUSINESS WEEKLY \"POSLOVNI TJEDNIK\" THAT A WAR IN IRAQ COULD 
ACTUALLY HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CROATIA,S ECONOMY, 
PARTICULARLY ON TOURISM.  \"IT IS EXPECTED THAT EUROPEANS WILL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00579  01 OF 03  141724Z 
CHOOSE TO TRAVEL TO CLOSER DESTINATIONS RATHER THAN TO ASIA 
AND OTHER DISTANT PLACES,\" HE SAID.  HE ADDED THAT THE REST 
OF CROATIA,S ECONOMY HAD LIMITED TIES WITH IRAQ.  INDEED, 
DESPITE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF A CRISIS IN TOURISM 
POST-SEPTEMBER 11, CROATIA HAD ITS BEST TOURISM SEASON IN 
OVER A DECADE LAST YEAR, ALBEIT ALMOST A YEAR AFTER THE 
ATTACKS.  JURCIC\'S OPTIMISTIC COMMENTS WERE ECHOED RECENTLY 
BY PRESIDENT MESIC IN THE DAILY, \"VECERNI LIST.\" 
 
---------------------------- 
PROBLEMS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
---------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 25 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, DEFENSE 
MINISTER ZELJKA ANTUNOVIC EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT CROATIA\'S 
VULNERABILITY TO REACTIONS EMANATING FROM NEIGHBORING BOSNIA 
AND HERZEGOVINA (BIH) TO HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ.  SHE WORRIED 
THAT THE GOC DECISION TO PROVIDE LIMITED LOGISTICAL SUPPORT 
FOR POTENTIAL ACTION IN IRAQ COULD MAKE CROATIA MORE OF A 
TARGET. 
 
7.  (U) THESE CONCERNS ARE ECHOED IN THE PRESS BY A NUMBER OF 
CROATIAN ACADEMICS AND COMMENTATORS WHO POINT TO THE PRESENCE 
OF AL-QAIDA TERRORIST CELLS IN BIH.  \"THEY WILL PRIMARILY 
TARGET COUNTRIES SUCH AS GREAT BRITAIN AND THE U.S.,\" WROTE

SUBJECT: IMPLICATIONS FOR CROATIA\'S ECONOMY OF WAR WITH IRAQ 
 
ONE CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENTIST, \"BUT STRONG SECURITY 
MEASURES THERE COULD EASILY DIVERT THEM TO OTHER COUNTRIES 
SUCH AS CROATIA, NOW THAT IT HAS SIGNED UP TO THE VILNIUS 
GROUP STATEMENT ON IRAQ.8 
 
------------- 
OIL RESERVES 
------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, IF THE PRICE 
OF OIL INCREASES DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE OF HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ, 
THE MINISTRY WOULD INTRODUCE MEASURES TO CUSHION A PRICE 
SHOCK, SUCH AS CUTTING TAXES ON PETROLEUM, WHICH MAKE UP A 
SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PRICE.  THIS OF COURSE WOULD HAVE 
AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE BUDGET, ALREADY UNDER SEVERE 
PRESSURE ON BOTH THE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE SIDES.  MANY 
OBSERVERS ALREADY DOUBT THAT THE GOC WILL MEET THE TARGETS IN 
ITS PRECAUTIONARY IMF AGREEMENT. 
 
9.  (U) ON FEBRUARY 20, THE GOC ADOPTED A \"DECREE ON 
MANDATORY SUPPLIES OF OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS\" AIMED AT 
BULKING UP THE OIL RESERVES FROM A 15-DAY TO THREE-MONTH 
SUPPLY.  WHILE THE PRESS LINKED THIS MEASURE TO THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A WAR IN THE GULF, IN REALITY THE DECREE WAS 
THE RESULT OF A LONG-PLANNED EFFORT TO MAKE CROATIAN 
LEGISLATION TRACK WITH EU REQUIREMENTS, ACCORDING TO THE HEAD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00579  02 OF 03  141724Z 
OF THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT AT THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY. 
 
10.  (U) THE EFFECT OF THE DECREE IS GRADUAL: MAJOR IMPORTERS 
(INA, THE STATE PETROLEUM COMPANY, CONTROLS ABOUT 85-90 
PERCENT OF THE MARKET) MUST HAVE IN \"STRATEGIC RESERVES\" THE 
EQUIVALENT OF 10 PERCENT OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR\'S IMPORTS BY 
APRIL 1.  THIS NUMBER WILL INCREASE TO 15 PERCENT BY JANUARY 
1, 2004.  NOT UNTIL 2006 WILL COMPANIES BE REQUIRED TO 
MAINTAIN 25 PERCENT OF THEIR PREVIOUS YEAR\'S IMPORTS -- I.E., 
A \"THREE MONTH SUPPLY.\"  THE PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT AT INA 
TOLD US THAT THE COMPANY HAD BEGUN BUILDING UP ITS STOCKS 
THREE MONTHS AGO, AND WAS CLOSE TO THE APRIL TARGET ALREADY. 
INA IS ALSO ABLE TO COUNT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CROATIA\'S 
PROVEN OIL RESERVES TOWARDS ITS STOCKS.  THEREFORE, IT DOES 
NOT HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY LARGE STOCKS OF PETROLEUM AT 
TODAY\'S HIGH PRICES. 
 
-------------------- 
WORST CASE SCENARIOS 
-------------------- 
 
11.  (U) INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS HERE AGREE THAT VOLATILITY IN 
WORLD OIL PRICES COULD HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON CROATIA,S 
ECONOMY.  SUSTAINED HIGHER OIL PRICES COULD BUMP UP INFLATION 
AND PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE CROATIAN KUNA.  DEPENDING ON 
THE DURATION OF A MILITARY CAMPAIGN, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
SECURITY MEASURES COULD PUT ADDED PRESSURE ON THE STATE 
BUDGET BY LOWERING REVENUES FROM TOURISM.  ACCORDING TO ONE 
ESTIMATE PUT OUT BY A GROUP OF BUSINESSES, IF THE WAR IN IRAQ 
EXTENDS LONGER THAN TWO TO THREE MONTHS THE STATE BUDGET 
COULD SUFFER $200 MILLION IN LOSSES AND PROJECTED GDP GROWTH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00579  02 OF 03  141724Z 
IN 2003 COULD BE TRIMMED BY 0.8 PERCENT. 
 
----------------------------------- 
EFFECTS ON OTHER BUSINESSES LIMITED 
------------------------------------ 
 
12.  (U) SOME 53 PERCENT OF CROATIA,S EXPORTS IN 2002 WENT 
TO THE EU, WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY 
THE CONFLICT.  A RECENT ARTICLE CONTAINED INTERVIEWS WITH 
SEVERAL EXPORTERS.  A FEW CROATIAN EXPORTERS NOTED PRE-WAR 
CONSUMER NERVOUSNESS IN OTHER MARKETS, SUCH AS BRITAIN AND 
TURKEY.  NO ONE DISCUSSED -- OR THE JOURNALIST DID NOT REPORT 
-- THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPANDED EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES IN AN 
IRAQ UNDERGOING RECONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION AFTER OVER A 
DECADE OF SANCTIONS. 
 
13.  (C) KONCAR, A STATE-OWNED MANUFACTURING AND ELECTRONICS 
FIRM THAT EXPORTS TO IRAQ UNDER THE UN ADMINISTERED 
PROCUREMENT PROGRAM, COULD ONLY IDENTIFY EVENTUAL, POSSIBLE 
RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES AS A NEGATIVE.  ANOTHER COMPANY 
THAT EXPORTS DREDGING EQUIPMENT SAID A 26 MILLION EURO 
CONTRACT THAT IT HAD NEGOTIATED WITH A BELGIAN PARTNER AND 
THE IRAQ GOVERNMENT LAST SUMMER WAS EXPERIENCING DELAYS IN 
BEING FINALIZED.  HOWEVER, PRIVATELY MFA OFFICIALS HAVE 
EXPRESSED HOPE THAT CROATIAN COMPANIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM

IRAQ\'S POST-WAR CONSTRUCTION. 
 
14.  (SBU) A CONTACT AT THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE TOLD US THAT 
THE GOC HAS LITTLE OR NO OFFICIAL DEBT OUTSTANDING WITH IRAQ. 
 A NUMBER OF CROATIAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN OWED MONEY SINCE 
BEFORE THE GULF WAR, BUT HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THEIR DEBT IN 
INCREMENTS OVER THE YEARS THROUGH THE UN COMPENSATION 
COMMISSION PROCESS.  OUR CONTACT FELT THAT WHILE COLLECTIONS 
WERE A FRACTION OF CLAIMS, THEY MAY WELL APPROACH THE REAL 
VALUE OF WHAT THE COMPANIES COULD LEGITIMATELY EXPECT. 
 
----------------------------- 
CENTRAL BANK RUNS THE NUMBERS 
----------------------------- 
 
15.  (C) THE HEAD OF THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT AT THE CROATIAN 
NATIONAL BANK ALSO DISCOUNTS ANY MAJOR EFFECTS ON THE 
CROATIAN ECONOMY, AT LEAST IF ANY CONFLICT IS OVER FAIRLY 
SOON.  FORTUNATELY, INFLATION IS ALREADY RELATIVELY LOW, AND 
OIL MAKES UP A FAIRLY SMALL SHARE OF THE TOTAL CONSUMPTION 
BASKET.  THE NATIONAL BANK BELIEVES THAT IF OIL PRICES 
REMAINED AT $30/BARREL FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD (MORE THAN 
THREE MONTHS), INFLATION COULD BE BUMPED UP BY A PERCENTAGE 
POINT.  \"THIS WOULDN\'T KILL US,\" OUR NATIONAL BANK 
INTERLOCUTOR TOLD US.  ALSO, HE RECOGNIZED THAT OIL PRICES 
ARE EXPECTED TO FALL SUBSTANTIALLY AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

HOSTILITIES. 
 
16.  (SBU) THERE WOULD BE A STRONGER NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE 
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.  THE CROATIAN NATIONAL BANK ESTIMATES 
THAT THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT COULD RISE BY 0.3 TO 0.5 
PERCENT OF GDP BECAUSE OF HIGHER OIL PRICES SHOULD PRICES 
REMAIN AT $30/BARREL FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. 
 
17.  (SBU) THE BANK ALSO TRIED TO LOOK AT THE EFFECT ON 
CROATIAN EXPORTS, PRINCIPALLY TO EUROPE, OF A CONFLICT, BUT 
THE EFFECTS WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY.  OUR INTERLOCUTOR 
SAID IT WAS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT PRE-WAR UNCERTAINTIES 
WERE DAMPENING GROWTH IN EUROPE AND AROUND THE WORLD. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
18.  (SBU) ALTHOUGH HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE 
A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CROATIAN ECONOMY -- AT LEAST AS 
LONG AS THEY DO NOT DRAG ON -- THE OFFICIAL AND MEDIA 
ANGST-MEISTERS WILL CONTINUE TO PROPAGATE GLOOMY FORECASTS, 
MAKE DUBIOUS CONNECTIONS AND PROJECT SCENARIOS TO EXTREMES. 
TERRORISM IN EUROPE (OR WORSE, IN THE REGION) AND THE OVERALL 
STATE OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIES WOULD MORE SEVERELY AFFECT THE 
CROATIAN ECONOMY.

CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) POLITICAL PARTIES IN CROATIA\'S RULING COALITION COULD 
NOT AGREE ON A MODEL FOR ELECTION LAW REFORM AND HAVE DECIDED 
INSTEAD TO MAKE \"TECHNICAL CHANGES\" TO EXISTING LEGISLATION. 
THE COALITION NEVER REALLY MOVED BEYOND THE THEORIZING STAGE 
IN ITS EFFORTS TO CUT THE POLITICAL DEAL WHICH WOULD HAVE 
BEEN NECESSARY TO CHANGE CROATIA\'S ELECTION LAW.  FOUR 
SEPARATE DRAFTS WERE DEBATED IN THE PARLIAMENT, AND TWO HAVE 
MOVED ON TO A SECOND READING, BUT NONE OF CROATIA\'S POLITICAL 
LEADERS EXPECTS EITHER OF THEM TO BECOME LAW.  WHILE CROATIA 
APPEARS TO HAVE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE 
ACCOUNTABILITY OF POLITICIANS TO VOTERS, IT HAS OPTED FOR 
GREATER STABILITY: THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
INDEPENDENCE THAT GENERAL ELECTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE TWICE 
UNDER THE SAME RULES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) CROATIA\'S CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT ANY NEW 
LEGISLATION REGULATING ELECTIONS BE ADOPTED A FULL YEAR PRIOR 
TO THE DATE OF EXPECTED ELECTIONS.  BECAUSE THE CROATIAN 
PARLIAMENT TOOK UP ITS MANDATE IN FEBRUARY 2000, THE LATEST 
POSSIBLE DATE ELECTIONS COULD TECHNICALLY TAKE PLACE IS APRIL 
2004 (SIXTY DAYS AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE CURRENT MANDATE), 
WHICH MEANS THAT IF A NEW ELECTION LAW WAS TO BE PASSED 
BEFORE THE DEADLINE, IT MUST MOVE QUICKLY.  WHILE THAT 
DEADLINE IS CONSIDERED NON-BINDING BY SOME POLITICAL 
OBSERVERS (SINCE THERE IS NO SANCTION IF IT IS MISSED), MOST 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00602  01 OF 02  180840Z 
OBSERVERS THINK THAT THOSE WHO WERE PRESSING FOR REFORM 
MISSED THEIR CHANCE. 
 
3.  (C) THEORIZING ABOUT HOW TO REFORM CROATIA\'S ELECTION LAW 
HAS BEEN A POPULAR PASTIME IN ZAGREB, BUT THE TEMPO OF 
DISCUSSION INCREASED AS THE LIKELY DATE FOR ELECTIONS DREW 
NEARER.  WHILE PUBLIC STATEMENTS VARY, MOST POLITICIANS TELL 
US PRIVATELY THAT THEY EXPECT ELECTIONS TO TAKE PLACE THIS 
FALL, IN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER.  THE PARLIAMENT\'S POWERFUL 
COMMITTEE FOR CONSTITUTION, RULES AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS HAD 
BEEN WORKING ON A VARIETY OF DRAFTS FOR NEARLY A YEAR, BUT 
COULD NOT AGREE ON A SINGLE SYSTEM.  COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN MATO 
ARLOVIC (SDP) DESCRIBED FOR US A COMPLICATED PROPOSAL FOR 
COMBINING PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WITH DIRECT ELECTION 
FROM AN OPEN LIST.  EVEN AS HE DESCRIBED THE THEORY, HE TOLD 
US THAT IT HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING LAW. 
 
EVERYBODY\'S GOT A DRAFT ELECTION LAW 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) RATHER THAN SITTING DOWN AND AGREEING ON A 
COMPROMISE SOLUTION, THE COALITION\'S TWO LARGEST PARTIES -- 
THE SDP AND HSS -- FORMALLY SUBMITTED THEIR OWN SEPARATE 
DRAFTS FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE PARLIAMENT.  THE OPPOSITION 
DEMOCRATIC CENTER (DC - WITH ONLY THREE SEATS IN THE CURRENT 
PARLIAMENT) TABLED ITS DRAFT, AND ONE MP FROM THE IDS 
(ISTRIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION - A REGIONAL PARTY) AND ONE FROM 
THE LS (LIBERAL PARTY - WITH FOUR SEATS) TABLED YET ANOTHER. 
 
MINORITY REPRESENTATION, DIASPORA, REDISTRICTING

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00602  01 OF 02  180840Z 
 
5.  (SBU) ALL OF THE SPONSORS OF THE VARIOUS DRAFTS ASSERT 
THAT THEIR COMMON GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF MPS\' 
DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY TO VOTERS BY LETTING VOTERS, RATHER 
THAN PARTY LEADERS, DECIDE WHICH CANDIDATES FROM A PARTY LIST 
SECURE SEATS IN PARLIAMENT.  WHILE THEY TREAT THE ISSUE 
DIFFERENTLY, ALL OF THE DRAFTS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ETHNIC 
MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES.  THE DRAFTS 
DIFFERED WIDELY ON HOW -- AND INTO HOW MANY DISTRICTS -- TO 
DIVIDE UP THE ELECTORAL SPACE AND ALSO ON HOW TO TREAT THE 
CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF DIASPORA VOTING. 
 
6.  (SBU) THE SDP PROPOSAL CALLED FOR CROATIA TO BE 
CONSIDERED A SINGLE ELECTORAL DISTRICT, WITH CANDIDATES 
CHOSEN FROM A \"SEMI-OPEN\" LIST.  REGIONAL AND SMALLER PARTIES 
CRIED FOUL, DECLARING THAT THE SDP WAS TRYING TO \"KILL THE 
SMALLER PARTIES.\"  PARTIES MUST TAKE AT LEAST FIVE PERCENT OF 
THE TOTAL VOTES CAST IN ANY ONE DISTRICT TO WIN A SHARE OF 
THE SEATS IN THE PARLIAMENT FOR THAT DISTRICT, AND ONLY THE 
LARGER, NATIONAL LEVEL PARTIES WOULD GET OVER THAT BAR IF THE 
ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS A SINGLE DISTRICT.  THE HSS PROPOSED A 
MIXED SYSTEM, WHERE HALF OF THE SABOR WOULD BE ELECTED IN 65 
WINNER-TAKE-ALL DISTRICTS, AND THE OTHER HALF IN A SINGLE

COUNTRY-WIDE ELECTORAL DISTRICT BASED ON PROPORTIONAL 
REPRESENTATION (WITH POLITICAL PARTIES DECIDING ON CANDIDATE 
LISTS). 
 
7.  (SBU) ALL OF THE COALITION PARTIES AGREE THAT, REGARDLESS 
OF WHETHER THEY PASS A NEW LAW OR JUST TINKER WITH EXISTING 
LEGISLATION, THE WAY THE CROATIAN DIASPORA IS REPRESENTED 
MUST CHANGE.  CROATIA\'S CONSTITUTION GIVES CITIZENSHIP TO 
ETHNIC CROATS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY RESIDE.  THE EXISTING 
TUDJMAN-ERA STATUTE ALLOWS ALL CITIZENS TO VOTE, EVEN IF THEY 
HAVE NEVER LIVED IN CROATIA.  THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF 
ETHNIC CROATS WHO VOTED FROM ABROAD IN THE 2000 ELECTIONS 
WERE HARD-LINE HDZ SUPPORTERS IN BOSNIA.  THE SDP PROPOSAL 
WOULD ALLOW FOR DIASPORA VOTING, BUT WOULD REQUIRE PROOF OF 
LEGAL RESIDENCE IN CROATIA FOR THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO 
ELECTIONS.  THE HSS PROPOSED TO LIMIT DIASPORA MPS TO THREE, 
WITH ONE FROM EUROPE, ONE FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND 
ONE REPRESENTING THE DIASPORA IN AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA. 
 
8.  (C) THE IDS/LS PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE DIASPORA ISSUE WAS 
BASED ON A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH BIH ON DUAL CITIZENSHIP, 
STILL TO BE NEGOTIATED.  CROATIA AND BIH CONTINUE 
NEGOTIATIONS AND MAY YET CONCLUDE THE AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD 
PREVENT BIH CITIZENS FROM VOTING IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY\'S 
ELECTIONS.  BUT HIGH REPRESENTATIVE PADDY ASHDOWN\'S JANUARY 
2003 DECISION TO DELAY IMPOSING A DUAL CITIZENSHIP LAW IN BIH 
MAY HAVE TAKEN THE ISSUE OFF THE FRONT BURNER.

9.  (C) THE OPPOSITION HDZ, CROATIA\'S LARGEST PARTY, HAS NOT 
PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL OF ITS OWN, EVEN THOUGH IT STANDS TO 
LOSE THE MOST WHEN DIASPORA VOTING RIGHTS ARE CURTAILED. HDZ 
PRESIDENT SANADER\'S EARLY \"SOUND BITE\" ON CHANGING THE 
ELECTION LAW HAS BEEN \"WE\'LL WIN WITH ANY SYSTEM,\" ALTHOUGH 
HIS PARTY STANDS TO LOSE THE MOST IF BOSNIAN CROATS ARE 
RESTRICTED FROM VOTING.  A MORE LIKELY REASON FOR THE HDZ\'S 
RETICENCE TO SUBMIT A DRAFT IS THAT ITS LEADERS KNOW THE 
COALITION WILL VOTE DOWN ANYTHING THEY PROPOSE. 
 
10.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 14, THE PARLIAMENT INSTRUCTED THE 
COMMITTEE FOR CONSTITUTION, RULES AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS TO 
PREPARE \"TECHNICAL CHANGES\" TO THE EXISTING ELECTION LAW IN 
ORDER TO BRING IT INTO COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE 
CONSTITUTION AND THE NEW LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES.  IN WHAT 
COULD SEEM LIKE A CONTRADICTION, THE PARLIAMENT ALSO 
PERMITTED THE SDP AND HSS DRAFT ELECTION LAWS TO ADVANCE IN 
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.  NOW THAT THESE BILLS HAVE PASSED 
THEIR \"FIRST READING,\" THEY WILL BE SCHEDULED FOR A SECOND 
AND FINAL DEBATE WITHIN SIX MONTHS UNLESS THEY ARE WITHDRAWN 
BY THEIR SPONSORS.  ONE POLITICAL ANALYST SUGGESTED THAT THE 
HSS AND SDP WANT TO KEEP THE \"THREAT\" TO SMALLER PARTIES 
ACTIVE TO ENSURE THAT SMALLER COALITION PARTNERS SUPPORT THE 
\"TECHNICAL CHANGES\" TO THE EXISTING LAW.  ANTE MARKOV, A 
SENIOR HSS MP, TOLD US THAT THE PARLIAMENT WILL PROBABLY 
AGREE TO SOME SORT OF RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT TO RESTRICT THE 
DIASPORA VOTE UNTIL CLEAR RULES DEFINING DUAL NATIONALITY ARE 
DEVELOPED.

REF: (A) ZAGREB 470 (B) ZAGREB 305 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE ROSSIN, REASONS 1. 
5 (B) AND (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) LOCAL EUROPEAN COMMISSION HOM WUNENBURGER TOLD 
AMBASSADOR THAT COMMISSIONER PATTEN, DURING A MARCH 13 VISIT 
TO ZAGREB, EMPHASIZED THE GOC\'S NEED TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS ON 
ICTY COOPERATION, REFUGEE RETURNS, JUDICIAL REFORM AND MEDIA 
LEGISLATION.  MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT MESIC, PM RACAN AND KEY 
PARLIAMENTARIANS WERE BRIEF DUE TO THE DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION 
AND PATTEN\'S SUDDEN NEED TO VISIT BELGRADE. 
 
2. (C) IN HIS PRE-BRIEF WITH WUNENBURGER, PATTEN EXPRESSED 
CONCERN THAT IC PRESSURE ON SERBIA OVER ICTY HAD BEEN TOO 
HARSH AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE ASSASSINATION.  THIS MAY ALSO 
AFFECT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE EU PRESSES CROATIA ON ICTY. 
THE COMMISSION WILL ISSUE ITS SAA IMPLEMENTATION REPORT ON 
CROATIA IN ABOUT A WEEK.  WUNENBURGER RECOMMENDED SPECIFIC 
BENCHMARKS ON RETURNS BE INCLUDED IN THE SAA REPORT TO GUIDE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00617  01 OF 03  181557Z 
WORK ON THE AVIS ON CROATIA\'S APPLICATION OVER THE NEXT YEAR 
BUT HE WAS UNSURE SUCH BENCHMARKS WOULD BE.  THE BENCHMARKS 
HE LISTED WOULD MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE, BUT IN OUR VIEW 
THE GOC WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO IMPLEMENT THEM. 
 
3. (C) WUNENBURGER PERSONALLY BELIEVED THE GOC\'S UNHELPFUL 
STANCE ON IRAQ HAD BEEN DRIVEN, IN PART, BY THE CALCULATION 
THAT FRANCE WOULD BE DECISIVE WITH REGARD TO CROATIA\'S EU 
APPLICATION.  WE SUSPECT HE IS RIGHT; TIME WILL TELL IF THE 
GOC HAS JUDGED THAT RIGHT OR NOT AS THE EU EXPANDS TO 25 
MEMBERS, MOST OF WHICH ARE ON BOARD WITH THE IRAQ COALITION. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
PATTEN\'S DIRECT MESSAGE 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) PATTEN\'S VISIT WAS LONG-SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS CROATIA\'S 
EU APPLICATION AND ASSESS PROGRESS ON THE STABILIZATION AND 
ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (SAA).  WHILE TRUNCATED DUE TO THE 
DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION AND UNFORESEEN BELGRADE VISIT, PATTEN 
WAS ABLE TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT MESIC, PM RACAN, AND SABOR 
PRESIDENT TOMCIC TOGETHER WITH SABOR FOREIGN RELATIONS AND 
EUROPEAN INTEGRATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS.  ALL MEETINGS WERE 
BRIEF DUE TO THE BELGRADE IMPERATIVE.  NEITHER IRAQ NOR THE 
DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION FIGURED MUCH.  IN EACH MEETING, PATTEN 
STRESSED THE FOUR AREAS WHERE, HE SAID, CROATIA NEEDED TO USE 
THE NEXT YEAR (UP TO ISSUANCE OF THE COMMISSION AVIS) TO MAKE 
PROGRESS ON KEY POLITICAL AREAS: 
 
  --  FULL ICTY COOPERATION, NO FALTERING; 
  --  ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT ACTUAL RETURNS OF REFUGEES; 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00617  01 OF 03  181557Z 
  --  CONCRETE PROGRESS ON JUDICIAL REFORM; 
  --  MEDIA LEGISLATION MEETING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. 
 
5. (C) THE GOC SIDE DID NOT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT RESPONSES DUE 
TO THE BREVITY OF THE MEETINGS, BUT MADE GENERAL ASSURANCES. 
WITH REGARD TO THE GOC\'S ALLEGED FAILURE TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTS 
REQUESTED BY THE ICTY PROSECUTOR, RACAN REPEATED THE GOC 
POSITION THAT THIS IS BECAUSE ICTY\'S REQUESTS ARE TOO BROAD 
AND VAGUE TO ANSWER -- WHICH, WUNENBURGER REMARKED, THE EC 
KNOWS IS UNTRUE.  RACAN ASSERTED TO PATTEN THAT HE WOULD SHOW 
HMG EVIDENCE PROVING THAT CROATIA\'S COMPLAINT ABOUT THE 
NATURE OF THESE DOCUMENT REQUESTS WAS WELL FOUNDED WHEN HE 
VISITED LONDON MARCH 18-19 (NOW CANCELLED).  ON RETURNS, THE 
GOC GAVE GENERAL ASSURANCES. 
 
6. (C) PATTEN ASSURED THE CROATIANS THAT THEIR APPLICATION 
WOULD NOT BE IMPEDED BY THE RESURGENCE OF INSTABILITY IN 
NEIGHBORING SERBIA; THAT BECAME THE MEDIA HEADLINES.  IN 
FACT, WUNENBURGER COMMENTED, IT IS CLEAR TO HIM THAT THE 
DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION WILL BOOST THE PROSPECTS FOR CROATIA\'S 
APPLICATION -- HOWEVER GOOD OR BAD THE GOC\'S RECORD OF 
MEETING THE EU\'S POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY -- BECAUSE THE EU 
DOES SEE CROATIA AS, AND WANTS TO ENSURE IT REMAINS, A 
COUNTRY OF RELATIVE STABILITY IN THE REGION.  ONLY A MAJOR 
ICTY BLOWUP WOULD DERAIL THAT, IN WUNENBURGER\'S ASSESSMENT.

SUBJECT: PATTEN IN CROATIA:  DOUBTS OVER ICTY PRESSUE; WAY 
AHEAD ON CROATIA\'S APPLICATION 
 
PATTEN: \"TOO MUCH\" PRESSURE ON WAR CRIMES? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) WUNENBURGER SAID THAT PATTEN, IN THEIR PREBRIEF, 
RUMINATED ABOUT THE TRAGEDY IN SERBIA AND HIS CONCERN THAT 
THE ASSASSINATION MAY HAVE COME ABOUT IN PART DUE TO 
EXCESSIVE IC PRESSURE FOR ICTY COMPLIANCE.  HE BELIEVED THIS 
MIGHT INFLUENCE FUTURE COMMISSION (AND POSSIBLY EU) 
APPROACHES NOT ONLY TOWARD SERBIA BUT ALSO TOWARD CROATIA AND 
OTHER RELEVANT COUNTRIES. 
 
8. (C) FOR HIS OWN PART, WUNENBURGER EXPRESSED CONCERN LESS 
ABOUT THE DEGREE OF PRESSURE ON CROATIA THAN ABOUT ICTY\'S 
TACTICS HERE, WHETHER ITS INCLUSION OF BROAD HISTORICAL 
ELEMENTS IN INDICTMENTS UNNECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL 
PROSECUTIONS, ITS UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTIONS ABOUT GOTOVINA\'S 
PRESENCE IN CROATIA OR ITS RELATIVELY LOWER PROFILE HANDLING 
OF WHAT HE CALLED ITS MOST SERIOUS COMPLAINT, INADEQUATE 
COOPERATION ON PROVIDING DOCUMENTS.  OTHER THAN THE 
\"HISTORICAL\" ELEMENTS OF THE INDICTMENTS, WUNENBURGER\'S 
CONCERNS CLOSELY MATCHED OUR OWN, ON WHICH WE HAVE RECENTLY 
REPORTED (REFTELS).  HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH PATTEN RECENTLY MET 
WITH CARLA DEL PONTE, WUNENBURGER UNDERSTOOD THAT PATTEN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00617  02 OF 03  181557Z 
RAISED NO SUCH CONCERNS WITH HER.  (THAT WAS BEFORE THE 
DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION.) 
 
NEXT EU STEPS ON CROATIA 
------------------------ 
 
9. (C) WUNENBURGER SAID THE COMMISSION SHOULD ISSUE ITS 
ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF CROATIA\'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAA IN 
ABOUT A WEEK.  IT WILL HIGHLIGHT AREAS OF PROGRESS AND 
SHORTFALL ACROSS THE SAA BOARD, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE 
POLITICAL CONDITIONS LISTED ABOVE.  THE SAA PROVIDES THE 
COMMISSION WITH AN ADDED, CONCRETE FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING 
ITS AVIS ON CROATIA\'S EU APPLICATION.  THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE 
CASE WITH PREVIOUS APPLICATIONS.  (NOTE: CROATIA\'S 
APPLICATION WAS SUBMITTED IN FEBRUARY; CROATIA HOPES IT WILL 
BE FORWARDED BY THE COUNCIL TO THE COMMISSION FOR AVIS IN 
APRIL BUT THIS MAY NOT OCCUR UNTIL JUNE.  A COUPLE OF 
COUNTRIES, NOTABLY THE UK, HAVE NOT RATIFIED THE SAA YET AND 
MAY SEEK TO IMPEDE COUNCIL ACTION ON THE APPLICATION.) 
 
10. (C) WUNENBURGER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE HAS RECOMMENDED 
THE INCLUSION OF SPECIFIC RETURNS-RELATED BENCHMARKS IN THIS 
YEAR\'S SAA REPORT: COMPLETION OF ALL PROPERTY RESTITUTION 
THIS YEAR; ACTION ON ALL HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION APPLICATIONS 
THIS YEAR; AND ESTABLISHMENT THIS YEAR OF A CONCRETE, 
TRANSPARENT PROGRAM TO \"COMPENSATE\" THOSE WHO FORMERLY 
ENJOYED OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS TO SOCIALLY-OWNED 
PROPERTY.  HE SAID HE WAS UNSURE WHETHER THE COMMISSION WOULD 
INCLUDE THESE. 
 
11. (C) LOOKING AHEAD TO THE AVIS IN A YEAR OR SO, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00617  02 OF 03  181557Z 
WUNENBURGER SAID THAT INCLUSION OF THESE BENCHMARKS AS WELL 
AS THE GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF THE GOC\'S PERFORMANCE ON THE 
POLITICAL CONDITIONS WOULD BE CENTRAL TO THE COMMISSION\'S 
WORK.  DEPENDING ON THE COMMISSION\'S ASSESSMENT OF CROATIA\'S 
(PERFORMANCE-PROVEN) READINESS TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH THE EU, THE COMMISSION WOULD RECOMMEND TO THE COUNCIL 
THAT THE APPLICATION BE ACCEPTED AND NEGOTIATIONS BEGUN; THAT 
IT AND NEGOTIATIONS BE DEFERRED WITH SPECIFIC AREAS FOR GOC 
EFFORT IDENTIFIED; OR THAT IT BE REJECTED.  THE LATTER WILL 
NOT HAPPEN; HE WAS UNCERTAIN FROM HIS OWN VIEW OF CROATIA\'S 
EFFORTS WHETHER IT WOULD GET A FAVORABLE OR A DEFERRED AVIS. 
IN THE END, HE CAUTIONED, THE POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY WILL 
WEIGH HEAVILY, BUT ALL FACTORS INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LEGAL 
ISSUES WILL BE \"BALANCED,\" AND IN ANY CASE THE COUNCIL WILL 
DECIDE; THE COMMISSION\'S AVIS IS JUST THAT, A RECOMMENDATION. 
 (THE COUNCIL ALMOST ALWAYS FOLLOWS COMMISSION 
RECOMMENDATIONS, HE NOTED, BECAUSE IT AND THE MEMBER STATES 
ESSENTIALLY PRECOOK THE FINAL RECOMMENDATION.)

BENCHMARKS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE SAA REPORT.  THEY MAKE 
SENSE; THEY WOULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE RETURNS SITUATION FOR

THE BETTER; THEY ARE TOUGH BUT ACHIEVABLE IF THE GOC DISPLAYS 
POLITICAL WILL (AS HE HAS TOLD BRUSSELS); AND THE SAA 
REPORT/AVIS PROCESS PROVIDES CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY BY A 
COMMISSION THAT WE KNOW IS UNWILLING TO TAKE THE GOC ON 
FAITH.  IF THE GOC WERE TO ACT SERIOUSLY ON THOSE SPECIFIC 
ISSUES, IT WOULD REPRESENT A SEA CHANGE IN ITS LACKLUSTER 
RECORD ON RETURNS AND MERIT EU (AND OUR) RECOGNITION. 
FRANKLY, HOWEVER, WE THINK THE GOC WOULD FAIL THE TEST, 
ESPECIALLY IN THIS ELECTION YEAR GIVEN THE INDIFFERENCE OR 
HOSTILITY OF VOTERS TO DEVOTING GOC EFFORT AND RESOURCES TO 
RETURNS. 
 
13. (C) DOWN THE ROAD, HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE VIEWS 
OF EU MEMBER STATES AND THEIR RELATIVE VIGOR IN PUSHING THEM 
WITHIN THE COUNCIL WILL DECIDE THE FATE OF CROATIA\'S 
APPLICATION.  IN THAT REGARD, WUNENBURGER\'S PERCEPTION THAT 
THE GOC CHOSE TO SIDE WITH FRANCE AND GERMANY THIS WEEK ON 
IRAQ BECAUSE IT SEES THEM AS THE MAIN ACTORS ON ITS 
APPLICATION COUILD TURN OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANT, AND A MAJOR 
ERROR.  CONSISTENTLY, THE GOC HAS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT 
THE EU HAS 15 -- SOON, 25 -- MEMBERS, AND THAT COUNTRIES SUCH 
AS THE UK, SPAIN AND POLAND WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE FATE OF 
ITS MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION.  BALKANS STABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

THINGS MAY TURN OUT LESS POSITIVELY FOR ZAGREB\'S EU

APPLICATION WILL COME ONLY AFTER THE NEXT CROATIAN ELECTION.

CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY NICHOLAS HILL, POL/ECON COUNSELOR, 
FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.   (C) DCM DELIVERED MARCH 18 REFTEL DEMARCHES TO MARIO 
    NOBILO, ASSISTANT FOREIGN MINISTER FOR MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS. 
DCM EXPLAINED THE U.S. DECISION NOT TO SEEK ANOTHER UNSC 
RESOLUTION AND URGED THAT THE GOC NOT SUPPORT HOLDING AN UNGA 
EMERGENCY SESSION ON IRAQ NOR USE THE COMMISSION ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS FOR DISCUSSING THE CURRENT SITUATION CONCERNING IRAQ. 
NOBILO SAID HE UNDERSTOOD OUR POSITION, AND SAID THE GOC 
WOULD BE \"CAUTIOUS\" ABOUT USING THESE VENUES, ALTHOUGH HE 
AGREED THAT THE UNCHR WOULD NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE FORUM. 
CROATIA DID NOT WANT TO SEE FURTHER HARM TO THE UN. 
 
2.   (C) IN DISCUSSING REFTELS, NOBILO STATED THE GOC\'S 
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE U.S. HAD DECIDED TO WORK \"OUTSIDE\" 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL CONTEXT.  HE SAID HE HOPED A WAR WOULD 
BE SHORT AND THAT LOSS OF LIFE WOULD BE MINIMIZED.  HE SAID 
THE GOC WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT A CONFLICT WOULD CONTRIBUTE 
TO A SPREAD OF TERRORISM.  THE ASSISTANT MINISTER ADDED THAT 
HE HOPED CROATIA WOULD BE A \"PARTNER\" IN POST CONFLICT 
INSTITUTION BUILDING. 
 
3.   (C) THE DCM UNDERSCORED DISAPPOINTMENT WITH PRESS 
REPORTS EARLIER ON MARCH 18 INDICATING THAT, IN ANNOUNCING 
THAT HIS MARCH 18-19 TRIP TO LONDON HAD BEEN CANCELLED, PRIME 
MINISTER RACAN HAD SAID TO THE PRESS THAT CROATIA AND THE UK 
OBVIOUSLY WERE \"NOT ON THE SAME SIDE\" (REF C).  FURTHERMORE, 
THE PM HOPED THE U.S. WOULD \"UNDERSTAND\" THE GOC\'S POSITION. 
THE DCM SAID THAT, IN FACT, THE U.S. DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE 
GOC POSITION; WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT CROATIA HAD 
FAILED TO JOIN THE COALITION TO DISARM IRAQ.  MOREOVER, WE 
HOPED THAT PM RACAN DID NOT MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT CROATIA AND 
THE UK WERE NOT ON THE SAME SIDE VIS-A-VIS THE IRAQ REGIME. 
 
    4.   (C) NOBILO RESPONDED THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN TRANSCRIPTS OF 
EXACTLY WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER SAID.  THE KEY PROBLEM FOR 
RACAN WAS THAT ALL THE FOCUS OF A LONDON VISIT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN ON IRAQ, AND CLEARLY CROATIA HAD A DIFFERENT VIEW. 
INDEED, IF RACAN HAD TRAVELLED TO LONDON, NOBILO FEARED, THE 
\"ENTIRE DISCUSSION\" WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER IRAQ.  (WE LEARNED 
SEPARATELY FROM UK SOURCES THAT THE IRAQ SITUATION MEANT THE 
BRITISH COULD NOT GUARANTEE RACAN A MEETING WITH PM BLAIR.)

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) ALMOST ALL OF CROATIA\'S POLITICIANS HAVE PUBLICLY 
BACKED THE GOC DECISION NOT TO SUPPORT MILITARY ACTION IN 
IRAQ ABSENT A NEW UNSC RESOLUTION (REFTEL).  POLITICAL UNITY 
IN CROATIA IS A GENUINE RARITY.  SOME LEADING GOVERNMENT 
FIGURES WANT TO TRY TO CATCH WHAT THEY THINK IS A WAVE OF 
LOCAL SUPPORT FOR THE GOC\'S DECISION TO SAY \"NO\" TO THE USG 
AND ARE CROWING ABOUT THEIR \"BRAVE\" DECISION.  OTHER 
POLITICAL OBSERVERS ARE DUMBFOUNDED BY THE GOC DECISION AND 
BY ITS MANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS.  THEY ARE WONDERING WHY 
CROATIA\'S POLITICIANS ARE MISSING ANOTHER EXCELLENT 
OPPORTUNITY TO SHUT UP.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MESIC: US ACTION WOULD HAVE QUESTIONABLE LEGITIMACY 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2.  (U) PRESIDENT MESIC, IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN 
\"SLOBODNA DALMACIJA\" ON MARCH 19, TOOK A HARD 
INTERNATIONALIST LINE.  HE SAID THAT THE U.S. \"DEPARTURE FROM 
THE UN CHARTER FRAMEWORK CALLS THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ACTION 
INTO QUESTION.\"  HE SAID THAT U.S. ACTION WOULD CREATE A 
PRECEDENT WHEREBY A COUNTRY THAT IS \"NOT AMERICA, SOMEONE WHO 
IS STRONGER THAN THEIR NEIGHBOR, CAN IMPOSE THEIR SOLUTIONS\" 
AND CITED CROATIA\'S EXPERIENCE WITH MILOSEVIC.  MESIC 
QUESTIONED WHETHER CROATIA NEEDS \"THIS KIND OF NATO.\" 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

DPM GRANIC: \"NO\" TO FUTURE USG REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3.  (U) DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GORAN GRANIC SAID THAT THE GOC 
IS \"CONCERNED ABOUT THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS AND, OF COURSE 
DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY ACTION OUTSIDE OF THE UN.\"  GRANIC SAID 
THAT THE GOC WOULD REJECT FUTURE U.S. REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT OF 
MILITARY ACTION \"ACCORDING TO THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE 
COUNTRY\'S LEADERS, WHICH IMPLICITLY STATES THAT IT MAY NOT BE 
AMENDED.  I REPEAT THAT CROATIA WILL OPPOSE ANY ACTION WHICH 
IS TAKEN OUTSIDE THE UN.\" 
 
SMALLER PARTIES GET ON THE BANDWAGON 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (U) LEADERS OF CROATIA\'S SMALLER POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE 
JUMPED ON BOARD AS WELL; THEIR COMMENTS WERE PUBLISHED IN THE 
MASS-MARKET DAILY \"VJESNIK.\"  FORMER FM MATE GRANIC 
(PRESIDENT OF THE OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC CENTER - DC) DECLARED 
THAT HIS PARTY DOES NOT SUPPORT MILITARY INTERVENTION WITHOUT 
A NEW UNSCR BECAUSE IT WOULD DIVIDE THE COUNCIL AND 
\"COMPLETELY DESTABILIZE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND THE UN 
WITH UNFORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCES.\"  DAMIR KAJIN OF THE 
REGIONAL PARTY ISTRIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION (IDS) SAID THAT THE 
U.S. DECISION TO GO AHEAD WITHOUT A NEW UNSCR \"DELEGITIMIZES 
THE ACTION AGAINST IRAQ, WHICH, LET\'S BE TRUTHFUL, AT THIS 
MOMENT IS NOT THREATENING ANYONE.\"  HE DERIDED THE STRONG 
PRO-U.S. POSITION OF THE OPPOSITION HDZ BY SAYING THAT HDZ 
PRESIDENT SANADER \"LOOKS LIKE HE IS RUNNING HIS ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN IN MASSACHUSETTS, NOT IN CROATIA.\"  HE SAID THAT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00631  01 OF 02  191658Z 
CROATIA\'S POLITICIANS ARE SHOWING AN \"ENVIABLE LEVEL OF 
UNITY.\" 
 
5.  (C) LUKA TRCONIC, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE HSS (THE 
COALITION\'S SECOND-LARGEST PARTY) SAID \"WE SUPPORT THE 
GOVERNMENT POSITION\" BUT EXPLAINED THAT HIS PARTY \"HAS 
UNDERSTANDING FOR THE FRUSTRATION OF THE AMERICANS AND THEIR 
DESIRE TO PUNISH SADDAM HUSSEIN.\"  EVEN THE FRINGE PARTIES 
ARE ECHOING THE RULING COALITION.  ANTO DJAPIC, PRESIDENT OF 
THE CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHT (HSP) SAID THAT \"THE HSP DOES NOT 
ENDORSE THE USA AND ALLIES\' ACTION IN IRAQ WHICH IS NOT 
BACKED BY A RESOLUTION OF THE UNSC.  THE MOTIVES FOR THE USA 
AND ALLIES TO ATTACK IRAQ ARE NOT IDEALS, BUT RAW INTERESTS 
OF A GREAT POWER.  (COMMENT: PM RACAN SHOULD BE WORRIED, NOT 
COMFORTED BY THE SUPPORT OF THIS PARTY OF RIGHT-WING 
EXTREMISTS.) 
 
COMMENTATOR: WHY COULDN\'T WE JUST BE QUIET?

NATO ATTACKS ON THE FRY.  WHILE HE AGREED WITH RACAN\'S 
DECISION TO POSTPONE HIS TRIP TO LONDON, HE LAMBASTED RACAN\'S

SUBJECT:  MOST CROATIAN POLITICAL PARTIES DISAPPROVE OF THE MILITARY ACTION 
 
 
1.  MEDIA COVERAGE OF IRAQ IN CROATIA IN THE LAST 24 HOURS 
HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY HOSTILE TO THE U.S. POSITION.  MUCH OF 
IT HAS FOCUSED ON CRITICISM OF THE IRAQ CAMPAIGN BY MEMBERS 
OF PARLIAMENT.  MPS REPRESENTING THE RULING COALITION AND 
JOINED BY SOME OF THE MARGINAL PARTIES IN THE OPPOSITION 
    HAVE ECHOED THE VIEWS AIRED BY THE GOVERNMENT -- THEY 
REGRET THE ATTACK ON IRAQ AND PURPORT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER.  ONLY THE CHIEF 
OPPOSITION HDZ PARTY DECLINED TO OFFER COMMENTS, POINTING 
OUT ITS VIEWS HAD BEEN PRESENTED EARLIER.  ON THE EVE OF 
THE WAR, THE HDZ WAS THE ONLY CROATIAN POLITICAL PARTY TO 
SUPPORT THE U.S. POLICY ON IRAQ, INCLUDING IN A BROADLY 
SUPPORTIVE OP-ED PIECE IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LAST WEEK 
BY PARTY LEADER IVO SANADER. 
 
2.  PEOPLES PARTY PRESIDENT VESNA PUSIC (HNS) TOOK THE 
GLASS AS HALF FULL PERSPECTIVE OF THE CONFLICT.  SHE WISHED 
THE WAR, FOR THE SAKE OF BOTH ALLIED FORCES AND THE IRAQI 
PEOPLE, WOULD BE OVER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, WITH SADDAM 
HUSSEIN GONE.  SHE LOOKED FORWARD TO REBUILDING DEMOCRATIC 
INSTITUTIONS.  OTHERS WERE LESS OPTIMISTIC.  ZDRAVKO TOMAC 
(SDP), WHO CHAIRS THE PARLIAMENTARY FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
COMMITTEE, SAID THAT THE U.N. SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN MORE 
TIME AS \"IRAQ AT THE MOMENT POSED NO THREAT TO WORLD 
PEACE.\"  THE PRESIDENT OF THE LIBRA PARTY, JOZO RADOS, 
CONDEMNED THE DECISION TO ATTACK IRAQ WITHOUT A SECURITY 
COUNCIL RESOLUTION.  HE TOLD REPORTERS THE DECISION 
\"PROBABLY MEANT SOWING THE SEEDS OF TERRORISM FOR THE 
FUTURE.\"  THE LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENT, IVO BANAC, SAID 
THAT, WITHOUT UNSC APPROVAL, THE WAR WAS A \"DANGEROUS 
OPERATION WITH UNCLEAR RESULTS.\"  HE ADDED THAT THE \"U.S. 
GOVERNMENT WOULD BEAR ALL CONSEQUENCES\" FOR THE DECISION. 
 
3.  EXCEPT FOR HDZ, CROATIAN OPPOSITION PARTIES AIRED 
SIMILAR NEGATIVE VIEWS.  THE SOCIAL LIBERAL PRESIDENT 
DRAZEN BUDISA (HSLS) SAID THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR WOULD 
    BE GRAVE FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS, FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW, 
FOR THE ROLE OF THE UN AND FOR RELATIONS AMONG ALLIES IN 
THE EURO-ATLANTIC PROCESS.  DEMOCRATIC CENTER PRESIDENT 
MATE GRANIC (DC) SUPPORTED THE PRINCIPLE OF MILITARY 
INTERVENTIONS WITHIN THE UNSC FRAMEWORK, RATHER THAN 
\"PLAYING ON THE CARD OF DIVISIONS\" BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE 
EU, OR EVEN WITHIN THE EU.  CROATIAN BLOC LEADER IVIC 
PASALIC (HB) HOPED THE ACTION WOULD BE OVER AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE AND CASUALTIES KEPT TO A MINIMUM.  ANTO DJAPIC OF 
THE RIGHT WING CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHTS (HSP) DESCRIBED THE 
MILITARY ACTION AS POSING THE \"BIGGEST CRISIS FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL ORDER IN THE LAST 40 YEARS.\"

PM RACAN: GOC COMMENTS FOLLOW AGREED LINE ... 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
1.  IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED ON MARCH 22 IN THE MASS 
    MARKET DAILY \"JUTARNJI LIST,\" PRIME MINISTER IVICA RACAN 
REITERATED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION \"REGRETTING\" THE LACK 
OF UNSC UNITY OVER THE DECISION TO USE FORCE TO COMPEL IRAQ 
TO DISARM.  HE SAID THAT ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S STATEMENTS 
FOLLOWED THE AGREED POLICY LINE, BUT HE CLAIMED THAT 
PRESIDENT MESIC DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE 
DELIVERING HIS SPEECH TO THE CROATIAN PEOPLE ON MARCH 20. 
(IN THAT ADDRESS, MESIC SAID USG MILITARY ACTION \"LACKED 
LEGITIMACY\" WITHOUT UNSC APPROVAL.) 
 
2. RACAN SAID CROATIA COULD NOT \"SELECTIVELY IGNORE\" 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS, AND ASKED RHETORICALLY WHAT 
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED \"HAD WE IGNORED, FOR INSTANCE, SECURITY 
COUNCIL DECISIONS ON ICTY AND STOPPED COOPERATION.\"  RACAN 
POINTED OUT THAT CROATIA HAD GRANTED OVERFLIGHT APPROVAL TO 
U.S. CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT CARRYING MILITARY PERSONNEL AND 
EQUIPMENT.  IN ADDITION, THE U.S. COULD USE CROATIAN 
AIRPORTS FOR FUELING, WHICH WAS \"MORE THAN OFFERED BY SOME 
OF THE COUNTRIES THAT WERE FORMALLY ALLIED WITH THE U.S.,\" 
THE PM SAID.

3. PRESIDENT STJEPAN MESIC RESPONDED TO RACAN\'S MARCH 22 
INTERVIEW BY DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF ANY MISUNDERSTANDING 
BETWEEN HIM AND THE GOVERNMENT ON THE IRAQI CRISIS.   HE SAID 
THAT THE FOREIGN POLICY LEADERSHIP AGREED ON A SINGLE 
STANCE; HIS SPEECH SIMPLY CAME AT THE SAME POSITION FROM A 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. 

4. PARLIAMENT SPEAKER ZLATKO TOMCIC (WHO IS ALSO PRESIDENT 
OF THE HSS, THE SECOND LARGEST COALITION PARTY) TOLD THE 
PRESS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN VIEW ON IRAQ AMONG THE 
PRESIDENT, THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE SPEAKER.  TOMCIC 
EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT A UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION 
ENDANGERED THE FUNCTIONING OF A WHOLE SERIES OF WORLD 
INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE UN, NATO AND THE EU.  \"IF THE 
ACTION ENDS SOON, WE WILL ALL COME OUT OF THIS LESS 
DAMAGED; IF IT TAKES LONG, CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WORLD\'S 
LEGAL SYSTEM WILL BE HARSH,\" TOMCIC SAID.

5.  THE LOCAL PRESS QUOTED ON MARCH 23 DEPUTY PM GORAN 
GRANIC AS SAYING THAT \"IT IS TRAGIC TO SEE HOW MUCH 
AMBASSADOR ROSSIN GOT LOST IN TIME AND SPACE,\" EXPLAINING 
HE MEANT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF \"ALL THOSE IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHO ALLOWED THEMSELVES MUCH GREATER 
RIGHTS THAN ARE USUAL IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, BOTH WITH 
REGARD TO THIS AND THE FORMER GOVERNMENT.\"  GRANIC ADDED 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING ANY FORM 
OF POSSIBLE U.S. \"PUNISHMENT,\" AS THE TITLE OF AMBASSADOR\'S

1.   (C) PRIME MINISTER RACAN \"INVITED THE AMBASSADOR FOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00669  01 OF 03  251246Z 
COFFEE\" MARCH 24 TO CLARIFY THE GOC\'S REASONS FOR ADOPTING A 
POSITION NOT ALIGNED WITH OURS ON IRAQ.  (THIS GOC POSITION 
HAS BEEN PLAYED OUT UNHELPFULLY IN THE PRESS OVER RECENT 
DAYS, AND THE AMBASSADOR CRITICIZED IT IN TWO INTERVIEWS.) 
ONE-ON-ONE, RACAN LAID OUT HIS MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE U.S. 
DECISION TO GO TO WAR WITHOUT A FINAL SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTION.  HE SAID THE GOC\'S OPPOSITION TO BEING INCLUDED 
IN THE COALITION OF THE WILLING WAS PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE 
SEVERE RISK OF A SPLIT IN THE GOVERNING  COALITION AND GOC 
LEADERSHIP.  THAT WOULD HAVE DESTABILIZED CROATIA AND 
ULTIMATELY THE REGION AND NOT BEEN IN THE U.S. INTEREST 
EITHER.  RACAN CONFIRMED THAT THE GOC WOULD CONSIDER NEW 
SUPPORT REQUESTS FOR COALITION OPERATIONS IF RECEIVED. 
(COMMENT: BUT WE CONSIDER IT VERY UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT MUCH 
MORE FROM CROATIA AND CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT PROTRACTED 
POLITICAL DEBATE).  RACAN STRESSED THAT THE GOC REMAINS 
COMMITTED IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM, BUT HE BELIEVED THE IRAQ 
INTERVENTION WOULD COMPLICATE THAT EFFORT.  RACAN SAID THAT 
THE OPPOSITION HDZ, IN TAKING A PRO-U.S. STANCE, AIMED TO 
SCORE CHEAP POINTS WITH US WHILE IT CREATED NEW ARGUMENTS FOR 
CURBING COOPERATION WITH ICTY UNDER A POTENTIAL FUTURE HDZ 
GOVERNMENT.  RACAN\'S PRESENTATION, HARPING ON FAMILIAR 
THEMES, UNDERSCORED ONCE AGAIN HIS LACK OF STRONG LEADERSHIP 
AND THAT DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALWAYS HIS 
CORE CONCERN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DOMESTIC CONSTRAINTS CONSTRAIN GOC POSITION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.   (C) AFTER TEN DAYS OF EXTENSIVE MEDIA BACK AND FORTH BY 
CROATIA\'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OVER ITS IRAQ POLICY, PM RACAN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00669  01 OF 03  251246Z 
TOOK ADVICE FROM HIS AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON AND FROM HNS 
PARTY LEADER VESNA PUSIC AND INVITED THE AMBASSADOR FOR 
COFFEE MARCH 24 TO EXPLAIN HIS GOVERNMENT\'S POSITION 
DIRECTLY.  HE SAID HE WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE TONE OF THE PUBLIC 
POLEMIC.  CROATIA WAS IN A \"VERY DELICATE\" POSITION.  WHEN 
THE U.S. FAILED TO SECURE A FINAL UNSC RESOLUTION BEFORE 
STARTING HOSTILITIES, THE GOC WAS COMPELLED TO DECLINE OUR 
INVITATION TO JOIN THE COALITION OF THE WILLING.  RACAN SAID 
HE HAD NO CHOICE, AND THE AMBASSADOR\'S MARCH 19 INTERVIEW 
STATEMENT THAT HE HAD NOT SHOWN LEADERSHIP FAILED TO 
APPRECIATE THE PM\'S SEVERE POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS.  THE GOC 
WAS DEEPLY DIVIDED, WITH HIMSELF AND FM PICULA AMONG THOSE 
SUPPORTIVE; THEY WERE PITTED AGAINST FERVENT ANTI-WAR WING 
LED BY PRESIDENT MESIC AND PARLIAMENT SPEAKER TOMCIC.  HAD HE 
TRIED TO FORCE A POSITION SUPPORTIVE OF THE U.S., RACAN SAID 
THE GOC WOULD HAVE SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE.  THAT WOULD HAVE 
DESTABILIZED CROATIA AND THEREFORE THE REGION AND THEREFORE 
DONE A DISSERVICE TO KNOWN U.S. INTERESTS.  \"WHAT USE TO YOU 
WOULD CROATIAN SUPPORT ON IRAQ BE IF IN THE PROCESS CROATIA 
TURNED INTO A \'HOTSPOT?\'\" 
 
3.   (C) ALTHOUGH HE PUT HIMSELF IN THE MORE SYMPATHETIC 
CAMP, RACAN EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE WAR WOULD HEIGHTEN 
INSTABILITY FOR CROATIA, THE REGION AND THE WORLD.  APART 
FROM HIS REGIONAL DESTABILIZATION ARGUMENT, RACAN WORRIED 
ABOUT HEIGHTENED GLOBAL ANTI-AMERICANISM STEMMING FROM THE 
CONFLICT -- BAD NOT ONLY FOR THE UNITED STATES BUT FOR THE 
WORLD.  RACAN ALSO ARGUED WITH PERSONAL CONVICTION THAT THE 
IRAQ WAR WOULD MAKE THE TERRORISM PROBLEM WORSE -- 
TRANSFORMING WHAT HE SAW AS A SERIOUS BUT FINITE THREAT INTO 
SOMETHING NOW MORE LIKELY TO BE \"PERMANENT.\"  THIS HAD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00669  01 OF 03  251246Z 
IMPLICATIONS FOR CROATIA TOO BECAUSE CROATIA REMAINS A 
STEADFAST AND COMMITTED PARTNER IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST 
GLOBAL TERRORISM. 
 
HDZ OPPORTUNISM - HIDDEN AGENDA REGARDING WAR CRIMES 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4.   (C) CLEARLY IRRITATED THAT THE AMBASSADOR HAD HAD 
ANYTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THE OPPOSITION HDZ PUBLICLY, RACAN 
BOTH DISMISSED AND WARNED US ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE 
PRO-U.S. POSITION TAKEN BY ITS LEADER IVO SANADER.  RACAN 
SAID THAT ONE REASON FOR SANADER\'S STANCE WAS, OF COURSE, 
SCORING CHEAP POLITICAL POINTS AGAINST THE GOC AND WITH 
WASHINGTON; WE SHOULD NOT THINK SANADER OR THE HDZ SINCERE. 
BUT MUCH OF THE HDZ HAD A SECOND, TROUBLING AGENDA THAT HE 
HAD ALLUDED TO IN A MARCH 22 NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW: TO CREATE 
NEW POLITICO-LEGAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST COOPERATION WITH THE 
HAGUE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL (ICTY) FOR WHEN IT RETURNS TO 
POWER.  LET\'S BE REAL, RACAN SAID: THE U.S., AS THE BIGGEST 
POWER, COULD CHOOSE WHICH UNSCRS IT FOLLOWED AND WHICH NOT. 
A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE CROATIA CANNOT, AND THUS THIS GOC IS 
ADAMANT THAT CROATIA MUST HONOR ITS OBLIGATIONS TOWARD ICTY. 
THE HDZ, HOWEVER, WILL ARGUE THAT WHAT\'S PERMITTED TO THE USG 
IS PERMITTED TO CROATIA AND THUS IT NEED NOT, WITHOUT 
QUESTION OR QUALIFICATION, COMPLY WITH SO-CALLED 
INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS ON WAR CRIMES.  RACAN SAID HE

REMARKED THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HAD HE HEARD THE PM\'S 
EXPLANATION OF CROATIA\'S POLICY TEN DAYS AGO IN PRIVATE, 
RATHER THAN READING ABOUT IT FOR OVER A WEEK IN THE PAPERS. 
THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED HIS OWN DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE 
DEBATE HAD BECOME SO PUBLIC.  WE REMAINED \"DISAPPOINTED\" AT 
THE LACK OF GOC POLITICAL SUPPORT ON THIS HUGE, HISTORIC 
ISSUE.  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS TENDED TO FADE IN SIGNIFICANCE 
FOR THE USG AT THIS TIME.  BUT AT LEAST A TIMELY PRESENTATION 
BY THE PM WOULD HAVE ALLOWED US TO INFORM WASHINGTON OF THE 
GOC\'S MOTIVES BEFORE UNATTRACTIVE PRESS COMMENTARY BY HIM, 
DPM GRANIC AND PRESIDENT MESIC HAD DONE SO.  THAT SAID, WE 
AGREED THAT IT WAS BEST TO CIRCUMSCRIBE OUR AREA OF DISCORD,

DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE IN POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ, AND

-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) THE AMBASSADOR REJECTED GOC ASSERTIONS THAT COALITION 
MILITARY ACTION WAS \"ILLEGITIMATE\" OR IN CONTRAVENTION OF UN 
RESOLUTIONS.  IT WAS ONE THING FOR THE GOC TO TAKE A 
DIVERGENT POSITION ON POLITICAL GROUNDS, BUT ANOTHER TO 
ASSERT THAT ITS STANCE HAD LEGAL FOUNDATION WHEN IT HAD 
PRODUCED NO LEGAL ANALYSIS WHATSOEVER CONTRADICTING THE 
ANALYSIS WE HAD PRESENTED TO THE GOC.  \"SHOW US YOUR ANALYSIS 
OR MODERATE YOUR RHETORIC.\"  RACAN REPLIED BY DISTANCING 
HIMSELF FROM MESIC\'S TERMINOLOGY AND TONE.  CONTRARY TO 
MESIC, RACAN AND THE GOVERNMENT HE LEADS HAD NOT 
CHARACTERIZED THE U.S. POSITION AS ILLEGITIMATE OR CONTRARY 
TO UNSC RESOLUTIONS.  HE SAID THE GOC SAW NO PURPOSE IN THAT 
SORT OF DEBATE AND WOULD NOT ENGAGE IN IT.  (COMMENT: MESIC 
IS A FREE AGENT.  HE CLEARS NOTHING WITH RACAN OR THE MFA, SO 
RACAN\'S ASSERTION IS PLAUSIBLE.  HOWEVER, RACAN PAINTED THE 
MOST CONCILIATORY POSSIBLE PICTURE OF THE MFA\'S, HIS OWN AND 
OTHER MINISTERS\'  STATEMENTS.  THEY HAVE NOT PUSHED THE LEGAL 
ARGUMENT AS AGGRESSIVELY AS DID MESIC, BUT NEITHER HAVE THEY 
STEERED AS WIDE AS RACAN CLAIMED.) 
 
PURPORTED ADDITIONAL USG SUPPORT REQUESTS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED RACAN TO EXPLAIN AN ASSERTION IN 
HIS MARCH 22 INTERVIEW THAT CROATIA, WERE IT TO HAVE JOINED 
THE COALITION OF THE WILLING, KNEW FROM \"INFORMAL 
CONSULTATIONS\" WITH US THAT WE WOULD HAVE ASKED IT TO PROVIDE 
MUCH MORE MILITARY HELP, IMPLICITLY INCLUDING DEPLOYMENT TO 
IRAQ.  HE REMINDED RACAN THAT HE AND ALL U.S. OFFICIALS HAD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00669  02 OF 03  251246Z 
BEEN VERY PRECISE IN DESCRIBING OUR LIMITED SUPPORT REQUESTS. 
 WE HAD TOLD CABINET MINISTERS REPEATEDLY THAT WE FORESAW 
NO/NO CROATIAN MILITARY ROLE IN THE IRAQ CAMPAIGN BECAUSE ITS 
ONLY DEPLOYABLE CAPABILITY WAS ALREADY IN ISAF.  RACAN WAS 
INSISTENT THAT, FROM THE TIME OF OUR REQUEST FOR CIVIL AIR 
CHARTER LANDING AUTHORIZATION, WE HAD BEEN \"TESTING CROATIA\" 
BY IMPLYING FURTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE.  THE AMBASSADOR 
STRESSED THAT THAT WAS NOT SO; THAT WE HAD BEEN PRECISE; AND 
THAT HE AND THE GOC OUGHT TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN TALKING TO 
THE PRESS ABQ OUR DISCUSSIONS.  THIS WAS IN OUR MUTUAL 
INTEREST, TO AVOID FANTASTIC MEDIA REPORTS OF IMMINENT U.S. 
MILITARY BASING IN CROATIA.  (COMMENT: RACAN BETRAYED CLASSIC 
BALKANS CONSPIRACY THEORY PROCLIVITIES.) 
 
GOC WOULD WEIGH FURTHER REQUESTS -- DON\'T HOLD YOUR BREATH 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
9. (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED POSITIVELY RACAN\'S STATEMENT IN 
THE SAME INTERVIEW THAT, IF THE USG ASKED FOR FURTHER 
LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, THE GOC WOULD CONSIDER IT SERIOUSLY. 
THIS WAS ESPECIALLY WELCOME SINCE DPM GRANIC HAD SAID \"NO 
FURTHER APPROVALS\" LAST WEEK.  WAS IT TRUE?  WHILE NO FURTHER 
REQUESTS WERE NOW PENDING AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY MORE, 
THERE MIGHT BE AND WE WOULD WANT SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. 
 
10. (C) RACAN CONFIRMED THAT THE GOC WOULD CONSIDER ANY

DRIVE OUR TWO COUNTRIES APART.  WE WERE DISAPPOINTED, AND 
CROATIA\'S ABSENCE FROM THE LIST OF COALITION PARTNERS WAS 
NOTICED IN WASHINGTON, BUT IT WOULD SERVE BOTH SIDES TO TURN 
THE FOCUS ONTO AREAS OF AGREEMENT -- THE GWOT AND POST-WAR 
RECONSTRUCTION IN PARTICULAR.  THE AMBASSADOR AND RACAN 
AGREED ON A LOW-KEY MEDIA LINE ON THE MEETING WITH THAT

SPECIAL SITTING; UN ROLE IN POST WAR IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 76558 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: LAWRENCE G ROSSIN,AMBASSADOR FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE GOC WILL VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR A 
SPECIAL SITTING ON THE IRAQ CONFLICT, \"AS IT IS CURRENTLY 
FRAMED AND GIVEN THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE COMMISSION.\"  HOWEVER, 
    DEPUTY FM SIMONOVIC TOLD AMBASSADOR IN CONVEYING THIS 
POSITION THAT THE SITUATION AT THE UNCHR IS \"FLUID\" AND THE 
GOC MIGHT RECONSIDER IF THE PROPOSAL EVOLVED POSITIVELY AND 
PARTICULARLY IF THE EU SWUNG IN BEHIND IT.  THIS DECISION WAS 
TAKEN AT THE HIGHEST GOC LEVEL.  OBVIOUSLY, USMISSION GENEVA 
WILL NEED TO WATCH THE CROATIANS CAREFULLY; THEY UNDOUBTEDLY 
WILL ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH ANY EU POSITION THAT EMERGES. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) AMBASSADOR DELIVERED REF A DEMARCHE TO DEPUTY FM 
SIMONOVIC EARLY MARCH 25.  IN ADDITION TO PREVIOUS POINTS, 
AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED HIS VIEW THAT A GOC SHIFT FROM \"ABSTAIN\" 
TO \"NO\" WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE MUTUAL DESIRE OF PM 
RACAN AND THE AMBASSADOR TO CIRCUMSCRIBE OUR DIFFERENCES OVER 
IRAQ AND FIND COMMON GROUND, PER THEIR MARCH 24 MEETING. 
GIVEN OUR COMMON INTEREST IN REBUILDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 
THE UN SYSTEM AND FOCUSING THE WORK OF THE UNCHR ON REAL 
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, THIS SEEMED AN APPROPRIATE AREA FOR GOC 
SUPPORT.  IT WAS NO ACCIDENT THAT COUNTRIES LIKE CUBA, LIBYA 
AND ZIMBABWE WERE PUSHING THIS; APART FROM BECOMING AN 
ANTI-AMERICAN CIRCUS, IT WOULD EAT UP TIME OTHERWISE 
AVAILABLE TO EXAMINE THEIR ABUSES. 
 
3. (C) SIMONOVIC SAID HE HAD SPOKEN TO PM RACAN BEFORE THE 
MEETING AND WOULD SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN AFTERWARD.  PERSONALLY, 
HE SEEMED TO FIND MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS APPEALING, BUT HE 
SAID HE COULD ONLY PROVIDE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER AFTER 
CONSULTING HIS SUPERIORS. 
 
4. (C) SIMONOVIC APPEARED GENERALLY AWARE OF THE CONTENT OF 
THE AMBASSADOR\'S DISCUSSION WITH PM RACAN MARCH 24.  HE 
    AFFIRMED A GOC DESIRE TO END PUBLIC CONTROVERSY ABOUT OUR 
DIVERGENT POLITICAL POSITIONS ON IRAQ AND TO FOCUS ON 
CROATIA\'S SUPPORT FOR THE GWOT AND WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE 
IN POST-CONFLICT ACTIVITY IN IRAQ AS WELL AS ON THE FUTURE 
ROLE OF THE UN IN IRAQ AND IN MAINTAINING A STABLE WORLD 
ORDER.  UN INVOLVEMENT IN POST-WAR IRAQ WOULD CONSTITUTE \"THE 
FIRST PHASE FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE UN.\"  HE ASKED IF THE USG 
HAD DEVELOPED A POLICY OR FRAMEWORK FOR THE ROLE OF THE UN 
VIS-A-VIS IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION. 
 
5. (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THE PRESIDENT\'S AND SECRETARY\'S 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF DESIRE THAT THE UNITED NATIONS PLAY A 
LEADING ROLE IN POST-CONFLICT IRAQ.  IN THAT REGARD, THE 
AMBASSADOR NOTED WITH DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THOSE COUNTRIES 
THAT HAD OPPOSED THE UNSCR IN THE UNSC SEEMED NOW TO BE 
BLOCKING AMENDMENT OF THE OIL-FOR-PEACE ARRANGEMENT TO 
BENEFIT THE IRAQI PEOPLE, AND CRITICIZING THE IDEA OF A NEW 
UNSCR FOR POST-CONFLICT ACTIVITY.  THEIR APPARENT FOCUS WAS 
PERPETUATING THE PREVIOUS UNSC DEBATE, NOW ENDED.  SUCH 
DWELLING ON THE PAST WOULD NOT ENHANCE THE REVITALIZATION OF 
THE UN SYSTEM THAT WE AND THE GOC SEEK.  SIMONOVIC, CROATIA\'S 
FORMER UN PERMREP, NODDED IN AGREEMENT.  HE SAID HE HAD 
WRITTEN AN OP-ED (TO BE PUBLISHED IN A ZAGREB PAPER MARCH 26) 
CALLING FOR UN REFORM AND GREATER WEIGHT IN THE UN FOR THE 
MORE CAPABLE MEMBER STATES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT: WHILE SIMONOVIC SAID A LOT POSITIVE, THE FACT 
THAT IT TOOK HIM ALL DAY TO GET US AN ANSWER TO OUR UNCHR 
DEMARCHE, AND THAT THE ANSWER WAS SO CAREFULLY HEDGED, 
INDICATES THAT CROATIA WILL NOT BE PROMINENT IN WORKING FOR 
THE SORT OF UN REFORM HE ADVOCATED.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ON MARCH 24, THE RIJEKA COUNTY COURT FOUND FORMER 
CROATIAN ARMY GENERAL MIRKO NORAC AND TWO CO-CONSPIRATORS 
GUILTY OF INDIVIDUAL AND COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MURDER 
OF OVER 50 ETHNIC SERBS AND CROAT CIVILIANS IN THE TOWN OF 
GOSPIC IN 1991.  THE LANDMARK VERDICT, WHICH THE SUPREME 
COURT WILL HEAR ON DEFENSE APPEAL, MARKS THE FIRST TIME THAT 
SENIOR CROATIAN MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED IN A 
CROATIAN COURT FOR WAR CRIMES.  CROATIA\'S RIGHT WING -- 
INCLUDING HDZ PRESIDENT SANADER -- CONDEMNED THE DECISION; 
PRIME MINISTER RACAN AND VIRTUALLY THE REST OF THE GOC 
COALITION OFFERED NO COMMENT.  THE ICTY, WHICH CONTINUES TO 
HAVE INTEREST IN NORAC FOR HIS ROLE IN WAR CRIMES COMMITTED 
DURING THE 1993 MEDAK POCKET OPERATION, TELLS US IT WELCOMES 
THE RULING. 
 
2. (C) THE GOSPIC RULING IS A WELCOME TONIC AFTER THE SERIES

CRIMES CASE IN SPLIT (REFTELS).  THE CREDIT FOR THE SUCCESS 
GOES TO JUDGE SARIC AND A FEW DETERMINED PROSECUTORS AND 
INVESTIGATORS.  WITHOUT INTENSIVE AND SUSTAINED REFORM TO 
OVERCOME BIASED JUDGES, WITNESS INTIMIDATION, DELIBERATE 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND A FLAWED 
CRIMINAL CODE, THE GOSPIC CASE LIKELY WILL REMAIN THE 
EXCEPTION, NOT THE RULE.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE 
GOC TO DEVELOP A ROAD MAP FOR HOW WE CAN SUPPORT THE EFFORTS 
OF REFORMERS IN THIS DIFFICULT PROCESS, WHICH IS NECESSARY 
FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FULL RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC 
NORMS IN CROATIA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A LANDMARK RULING 
----------------- 
 
3. (C) ON MARCH 24, RIJEKA COUNTY COURT JUDGE IKA SARIC, 
SENTENCED FORMER CROATIAN GENERAL MIRKO NORAC, LOCAL CIVILIAN 
LEADER TIHOMIR ORESKOVIC, AND FORMER CROATIAN ARMY COLONEL 
STJEPAN GRANDIC TO 12, 15 AND 10 YEARS OF PRISON, 
RESPECTIVELY, FOR THEIR ROLES IN ORGANIZING AND MURDERING AT 
LEAST 42 ETHNIC SERB AND ETHNIC CROATS IN THE TOWN OF GOSPIC 
IN 1991.  THE CASE MARKS THE FIRST TIME SENIOR CROATIAN 
MILITARY OFFICIALS WERE CONVICTED OF WAR CRIMES IN A LOCAL 
PROSECUTION.  A FOURTH INDICTEE, IVICA ROZIC, WAS ACQUITTED 
DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE, WHILE THE PROSECUTION DROPPED 
CHARGES AGAINST A FIFTH INDICTEE, MILAN CANIC, IN MID-MARCH. 
(IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING HIS ACQUITTAL, THE GOSPIC PROSECUTOR\'S 
OFFICE INDICTED ROZIC FOR PLANTING 13 EXPLOSIVE DEVICES IN 
THE HOMES OF ETHNIC SERB RETURNEES FROM 1996 TO 1998, KILLING 
SIX.  CROATIAN DIRECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE RANKO OSTOJIC TOLD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00680  01 OF 04  260700Z 
US THAT THE POLICE BELIEVE ROZIC ALSO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
AUGUST 2000 MURDER OF ICTY WITNESS MILAN LEVAR, ALTHOUGH THEY 
HAVE INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE HIM.) 
 
4. (SBU) DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAID THEY WOULD APPEAL THE CASE TO 
THE SUPREME COURT, ARGUING THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT 
EVIDENCE TO CONVICT THE SUSPECTS.  THE SUPREME COURT HAS THE 
RIGHT TO ANNUL THE VERDICT OR TO REDUCE (OR INCREASE) THE 
SENTENCE.  DORIS HRAST, LEAD PROSECUTOR IN THE CASE, TOLD US 
THAT THE PROSECUTION WOULD APPEAL THE ROZIC ACQUITTAL AND 
ARGUE THAT THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLD THE SENTENCES AGAINST THE 
OTHER THREE FELONS.  THERE IS NO INDICATION AS TO WHEN THE 
SUPREME COURT MIGHT ISSUE ITS VERDICT -- PROSECUTION APPEALS 
IN OTHER WAR CRIMES CASES HAVE BEEN PENDING FOR OVER FIFTEEN 
MONTHS.  COUNTING THE TWO-PLUS YEARS NORAC SERVED IN 
DETENTION AWAITING AND DURING TRIAL, HE WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR 
PAROLE IN FIVE YEARS (AFTER HALF THE SENTENCE IS SERVED).

TAGS: ICTY, KAWC, KJUS, PREL, UNSC, HR 
SUBJECT: CROATIA WAR CRIMES: GOSPIC CASE ENDS IN CONVICTION 
 
HER VERDICT TO A COURTROOM PACKED WITH NORAC SUPPORTERS AND 
500 RIGHT-WING PROTESTORS OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE, SARIC MADE 
A POINT OF READING THE NAME OF EVERY VICTIM, EMPHASIZING THAT 
THEY WERE ALL LOYAL TO THE CROATIAN STATE.  SHE EMPHASIZED 
THAT THERE WAS NO JUSTIFICATION WHATSOEVER FOR THEIR 
\"LIQUIDATION.\"   APOLOGIZING TO THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, 
SARIC SAID THAT SHE HOPED THE SENTENCE WOULD BRING THEM SOME 
COMFORT.  SHE RECOMMENDED TO THE PROSECUTION THAT OTHERS WHO 
PARTICIPATED IN PLANNING AND EXECUTING THE CRIMES BE TRIED AS 
WELL.  (ACCORDING TO VARIOUS WITNESSES, UP TO 15 PERSONS 
PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING THAT ORESKOVIC AND NORAC CHAIRED 
IN WHICH ETHNIC SERB AND ETHNIC CROAT NON-COMBATANTS IN THE 
GOSPIC AREA WERE MARKED FOR EXECUTION.)  AT THE SAME TIME, 
SARIC SAID THAT MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES -- NORAC\'S YOUTH AND 
INEXPERIENCE, HIS RECORD OF \"VALOR\" IN DEFENSE OF GOSPIC, AND 
PRIOR SERB WAR CRIMES AGAINST ETHNIC CROATS -- COMPELLED HER 
NOT TO EXTEND THE MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT OF TWENTY YEARS AGAINST 
THE THREE CONVICTED DEFENDANTS.  (WHILE A MODEST SENTENCE BY 
U.S. STANDARDS, THE GOSPIC VERDICT WAS IN LINE WITH STANDARDS 
BOTH LOCALLY AND ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE.) 
 
CROATIAN POLITICIANS, ICTY REACT 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) POLITICIANS OF ALL STRIPES IGNORED JUDGE SARIC\'S 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00680  02 OF 04  260700Z 
MESSAGE THAT CROATIANS NEED TO BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR WAR 
CRIMES THEY COMMITTED.  CALLING NORAC A \"GREAT CONTRIBUTOR TO 
THE DEFENSE OF THE HOMELAND,\" HDZ PRESIDENT IVO SANADERS SAID 
THAT HE RECEIVED THE VERDICT WITH GREAT \"SORROW.\"  HE SAID HE 
WAS \"HOPEFUL\" THAT \"TRUTH AND JUSTICE\" WOULD PREVAIL IN THE 
SUPREME COURT.  SANADER CRITICIZED THE GOC FOR FOMENTING A 
CLIMATE THAT \"CRIMINALIZES BOTH WAR VETERANS AND CROATIA\'S 
INDEPENDENCE WAR.\"  (COMMENT:  BY PLAYING TO THE NATIONALIST 
RIGHT YET AGAIN, SANADER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE 
THAT HE IS SINCERE IN HIS ATTEMPTS TO MODERNIZE AND TRANSFORM 
THE HDZ.  WE HAVE LET THE HDZ KNOW OF OUR DISAPPOINTMENT AND 
OUR RESOLVE NOT TO GIVE SANADER THE VALIDATION HE SEEKS FROM 
US UNLESS HIS PUBLIC RHETORIC MATCHES HIS PRIVATE ASSURANCES 
OF REFORM.  END COMMENT.) 
 
7. (SBU) PRIME MINISTER RACAN AND OTHER LEADING COALITION 
FIGURES REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE JUDGMENT, BUT CALLED ON 
CROATIANS TO RESPECT THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AND NOT TAKE TO THE 
STREETS IN PROTEST.  HE SAID THAT THE PROCESS \"CONFIRMED THAT 
CROATIA IS A STATE IN WHICH RULE OF LAW PREVAILS.\"  ONLY IVO 
BANAC, PRESIDENT OF THE TINY COALITION LIBERAL PARTY (LS), 
HAD THE COURAGE TO STATE THAT CRIMES WERE COMMITTED IN GOSPIC 
AND THAT THE RIJEKA COURT\'S RULING DEMONSTRATES THE 
SERIOUSNESS OF THOSE CRIMES. 
 
8. (C) ICTY ZAGREB HEAD OF OFFICE THOMAS OSORIO TOLD US THAT 
ICTY PRIVATELY WELCOMED THE RULING, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD REFRAIN 
FROM PUBLIC COMMENT, AT THE VERY LEAST UNTIL IT HAS A CHANCE 
TO READ AND REVIEW SARIC\'S WRITTEN VERDICT.  (THE WRITTEN 
VERDICT IS NOT EXPECTED FOR AT LEAST A MONTH).  DESPITE THE 
GOSPIC CASE RULING, ICTY STILL MAY INDICT NORAC FOR HIS ROLE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00680  02 OF 04  260700Z 
IN WAR CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE CROATIAN MILITARY DURING THE 
1993 \"MEDAK POCKET\" OPERATION, OSORIO SAID.  ACCORDING TO 
CROATIAN PROSECUTOR HRAST, THERE IS NO LEGAL OBSTACLE TO 
NORAC SERVING HIS CROATIAN SENTENCE WHILE AWAITING TRIAL IN 
THE HAGUE. 
 
IMPLICATION FOR LOCAL PROSECUTIONS 
---------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) RACAN AND OTHER GOC OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT THE GOSPIC 
CASE DEMONSTRATES THAT CROATIAN COURTS ARE CAPABLE OF 
DELIVERING JUSTICE IN HIGHLY SENSITIVE WAR CRIMES CASES. 
HOWEVER, NOT TO DETRACT AT ALL FOR THE REAL COURAGE OF JUDGE 
SARIC AND OTHER INVOLVED IN BRINGING A HIGHLY COMPLEX AND 
SENSITIVE CASE TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION, GOSPIC REMAINS THE 
EXCEPTION, NOT THE RULE IN CROATIAN JURISPRUDENCE. 
 
10. (C) AS REPORTED REFTELS, OTHER WAR CRIMES CASES AGAINST 
ETHNIC CROATS -- SUCH AS THE NOTORIOUS LORA CASE -- HAVE 
ENDED IN FIASCO.  CHIEF PROSECUTOR MLADEN BAJIC RECENTLY 
COMPLAINED TO US THAT LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS INCREASINGLY ARE 
OBSTRUCTING NEW WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST ETHNIC 
CROATS.  BAJIC ADDED THAT HE FINDS IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT 
TO CONTROL HIS LOCAL PROSECUTORS IN WAR-AFFECTED AREAS SUCH

SUBJECT: CROATIA WAR CRIMES: GOSPIC CASE ENDS IN CONVICTION 
 
AS OSIJEK, GOSPIC AND SISAK. 
 
11. (C) THE GOSPIC TRIAL WAS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF A UNIQUE 
CONFLUENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES: 
 
-- IKA SARIC PROVED TO BE THE RIGHT JUDGE FOR THE CASE. 
STRONG WILLED AND PROFESSIONAL, SHE WAS ABLE TO WITHSTAND 
UNRELENTING RIGHT-WING PRESSURE AND THREATS.  LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS IN RIJEKA TELL US THAT AT LEAST ONE OTHER WAR 
CRIMES CASE THERE HAS STAGNATED BECAUSE INVESTIGATORS FEAR 
RIGHT-WING RETRIBUTION AGAINST THEIR FAMILIES. 
 
-- PROSECUTORS IN RIJEKA WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP SUFFICIENT 
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO CORROBORATE AND TO COMPEL CONVINCING 
EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY.  THIS COMBINATION OF REINFORCING 
MATERIAL AND WITNESS TESTIMONY HAS BEEN LACKING IN OTHER 
CASES, MOST NOTABLY THE LORA WAR CRIMES TRIAL IN SPLIT. 
-- THE PROSECUTION SKILLFULLY USED THE TESTIMONY OF SUSPECT 
STJEPAN GRANDIC AGAINST NORAC AND ORESKOVIC. 
 
-- IN ADDITION TO ETHNIC SERBS, NORAC AND HIS CO-CONSPIRATORS 
ALSO MURDERED ETHNIC CROATS WHOM THEY BELIEVED WERE NOT 
SUFFICIENTLY \"RELIABLE.\"  ACCORDING TO HRAST, THE MURDER OF 
CROATS HELPED INDUCE A NUMBER OF KEY WITNESSES TO STEP 
FORWARD AND TESTIFY, DESPITE INTENSE INTIMIDATION. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00680  03 OF 04  260701Z 
 
-- UNLIKE SOME OTHER WAR CRIMES CASES, THE DOCUMENT TRAIL IN 
THE GOSPIC CASE WAS EXTENSIVE, TO INCLUDE RECORDED BRIEFINGS 
TO BOTH PRESIDENT TUDJMAN AND DEFENSE MINISTER SUSAK.  THIS 
DOCUMENT TRAIL MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE DEFENDANTS TO 
COVER THEIR TRACKS AND FOR WITNESSES TO DEVELOP \"AMNESIA.\" 
 
-- EARLY IN THE TRIAL PROCESS, THE CASE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM 
GOSPIC TO RIJEKA, WHERE THE TRIAL COULD BE HELD IN A 
RELATIVELY BENIGN ENVIRONMENT.  HRAST WAS CONVINCED THAT HAD 
THE TRIAL BEEN CONDUCTED IN GOSPIC -- CROATIA\'S \"TWIN PEAKS\" 
EQUIVALENT -- THE PRESSURE ON THE JUDGES AND WITNESSES WOULD 
HAVE BEEN SO INTENSE AS TO PRECLUDE ANY CHANCE OF CONVICTION. 
 HOWEVER, THE GOC -- FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL REASONS -- HAS 
BEEN RELUCTANT TO TRANSFER OTHER WAR CRIMES CASES TO \"SAFER\" 
COURTS.  ALL OTHER WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS AGAINST ETHNIC 
CROATS IN CROATIA HAVE BEEN HELD IN THEIR ORIGINAL 
JURISDICTIONS.  ALL HAVE ENDED WITH VERY QUESTIONABLE 
RESULTS. 
 
LESSONS LEARNED 
--------------- 
 
12. (C) THE BOTTOM LINE, ACCORDING TO HRAST AND, SEPARATELY, 
CHIEF PROSECUTOR MLADEN BAJIC, IS THAT -- BARRING SIGNIFICANT 
LEGISLATIVE REFORM AND INCREASED POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THOSE 
PRESSING FORWARD WITH WAR CRIMES TRIALS -- THE GOSPIC CASE 
WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE EXCEPTION AND NOT THE RULE.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, THEY POINT OUT THAT THE GOSPIC CASE IS AN 
INSTRUCTIVE LESSON FOR OTHER CROATIAN JUDGES.  JUSTICE SARIC, 
WHO HAILS FROM THE SAME AREA OF CENTRAL DALMATIA AS ICTY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00680  03 OF 04  260701Z 
FUGITIVE ANTE GOTOVINA, IS EFFECTIVELY OSTRACIZED FROM HER 
COMMUNITY AND MUST LIVE UNDER A CONTINUING CLOUD OF THREAT 
AND INTIMIDATION FROM THE RIGHT-WING. 
13. (C) OUR CONTACTS MAINTAIN THAT UNLESS CROATIA\'S ELITE 
BEGINS TO ENFORCE RIGOROUS JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE AND ETHICAL 
STANDARDS, CROATIAN JUDGES ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO EMULATE 
LOZINA RATHER THAN SARIC.  UNFORTUNATELY, CHIEF SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE IVICA CRNIC IS NOT A LEADER, AND HE AND OTHER JUDGES 
ARE OVERLY SENSITIVE TO OUTSIDE CRITICISM.  THEY ARE SLOW TO 
DISCIPLINE THEIR OWN, EVEN WHEN IT IS A CASE AS EGREGIOUS AS 
JUSTICE LOZINA. 
 
14. (C) IN ADDITION TO ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING STRICT 
JUDICIAL STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE AND ETHICS, THE GOC ALSO 
MUST UNDERTAKE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE REFORMS IF IT IS TO 
ENSURE THE EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION OF WAR CRIMES CASES: 
 
-- CROATIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TELL US THAT THE GOC\'S 
FAILURE TO PROTECT WITNESSES IS A SEVERE HANDICAP.  NEW 
WITNESS PROTECTION LEGISLATION HAS BEEN DRAFTED WITH THE 
ASSISTANCE OF OUR DOJ/RLA PROGRAM, BUT THE DRAFT LAW AWAITS 
GOC APPROVAL BEFORE IT CAN BE SENT TO PARLIAMENT.  IT WILL BE 
A YEAR, IF NOT LONGER, BEFORE CROATIA HAS THE SEMBLANCE OF A 
FUNCTIONAL WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM, THAT IS, ASSUMING THAT

SUBJECT: CROATIA WAR CRIMES: GOSPIC CASE ENDS IN CONVICTION 
 
THE CURRENT DRAFT LAW IS NOT GUTTED DURING GOC AND 
PARLIAMENTARY DELIBERATIONS. 
 
-- WITNESSES WHO CHANGE THEIR TESTIMONY FACE NO SANCTION FOR 
PERJURY.  THE CRIMINAL CODE SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED PENALIZE 
AND DETER SUCH ACTIVITY. 
 
-- PROSECUTORS MUST BE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO STRIKE 
PLEA-BARGAINING DEALS IN CAPITAL CASES. 
 
-- THE GOC AND THE CROATIAN SUPREME COURT MUST DEMONSTRATE 
FAR GREATER WILLINGNESS TO TRANSFER WAR CRIMES CASES FROM 
TROUBLED JURISDICTIONS TO SAFER LOCATIONS SUCH AS ZAGREB AND 
RIJEKA.  THE GOC MAY ALSO WISH TO CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A 
SINGLE WAR CRIMES COURT THAT WOULD HANDLE ALL CASES AGAINST 
BOTH ETHNIC SERBS AND CROATS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
15. (C) THE GOSPIC CASE IS A STEP FORWARD.  CROATIAN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL OFFICIALS -- WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE 
ASSISTANCE, INDEED, WITHOUT ANY POLITICAL COVER FROM THE GOC 
-- SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED A TECHNICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY 
DIFFICULT WAR CRIMES CASE AND CONVICTED A CROATIAN WAR HERO. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00680  04 OF 04  260701Z 
 
16. (C) THE CHALLENGE FOR US AND FOR THE FEW REFORMERS WITHIN 
THE GOC IS HOW TO LEVERAGE THE GOSPIC RULING TO SUPPORT 
EFFORTS TO MAKE LOCAL PROSECUTIONS OF WAR CRIMES FAIR AND 
TRANSPARENT.  AS A NEXT STEP, WE ARE SCHEDULED TO DISCUSS THE 
GOSPIC CASE AND VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO CREATE A SPECIAL WAR 
CRIMES COURT WITH MINISTER OF JUSTICE ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC 
APRIL 2. 
 
17 (C) DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES TRIALS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE 
WAS A DARKER SIDE TO CROATIA\'S INDEPENDENCE WAR AND HELP 
NEUTRALIZE A HOT-BUTTON ELECTORAL ISSUE THAT THE POLITICAL 
RIGHT MIGHT OTHERWISE EXPLOIT.  ULTIMATELY, LOCAL PROSECUTION 
OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS WILL STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW AND HELP 
PRODUCE A MORE STABLE AND SELF-ASSURED CROATIA THAT IS 
CAPABLE OF TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE REGION.  IF 
SANADER\'S STATEMENT IS ANY INDICATION, WE CAN EXPECT THAT 
BAJIC AND OTHER ACTIVISTS WILL BE REMOVED OR SIDELINED AND 
THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS WILL STOP, IF CROATIA\'S 
UNRECONSTRUCTED RIGHT RETURNS TO POWER.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, ENRG, TRGY, SI, HR 
SUBJECT: KRSKO NUCLEAR PLANT AGREEMENT ENTERS INTO FORCE AT 
LAST 
 
REF: LJUBLJANA 216 
 
1. THE BILATERAL AGREEMENT ON THE KRSKO NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, 
LOCATED IN SLOVENIA BUT CO-OWNED BY SLOVENIA AND CROATIA, 
CAME INTO FORCE ON MARCH 11, THE DATE THE GOC RECEIVED THE 
SLOVENIAN DIPLOMATIC NOTE REGARDING SLOVENIAN RATIFICATION. 
ON MARCH 14, THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT REJECTED TWO MOTIONS 
FROM OPPOSITION PARTIES TO WITHDRAW CROATIAN RATIFICATION -- 
SOMETHING THE PARLIAMENT HAD LEFT OPEN AS A POSSIBILITY WHEN 
IT RATIFIED THE AGREEMENT IN JULY 2002 IN THE CASE THAT 
SLOVENIA DID NOT RATIFY BY THE END OF 2002. 
 
2.  WHILE THE AGREEMENT SETTLED OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND 
ARREARS THROUGH JUNE 30, 2002, THE DELAY IN ENTRY INTO FORCE 
MEANS THAT ANOTHER EIGHT MONTHS HAVE LAPSED DURING WHICH 
CROATIA RECEIVED NEITHER ELECTRICITY FROM THE PLANT NOR MONEY 
FROM THE SALE OF THE ELECTRICITY.  ACCORDING TO THE GOC, 
SLOVENIA IS ON THE HOOK TO PAY CROATIA FOR ITS SHARE OF 
ELECTRICITY PROCEEDS DURING THAT PERIOD .  HOWEVER, THE GOC 
HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL SEEK TO SETTLE THE ISSUE OF 
NON-DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY DURING THE EIGHT MONTH PERIOD 
SEPARATELY, AND WELCOMES THE AGREEMENT AS CLEARING THE WAY 
FOR CROATIA TO RESUME ITS ROLE AS FIFTY-PERCENT OWNER OF THE 
PLANT. 
 
    3.  OBJECTIONS TO THE KRSKO AGREEMENT IN THE PARLIAMENT 
CENTERED AROUND WHETHER THE FINANCIAL PROVISIONS WERE GOOD 
FOR CROATIA.  ONE OBJECTION CAME FROM THE HSLS (CROATIAN 
SOCIAL LIBERAL PARTY), WHICH LEFT THE RULING COALITION LAST 
SUMMER, OSTENSIBLY OVER THIS ISSUE, AND THE EXTREME 
RIGHT-WING HSP (CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHTS), WHICH REPORTEDLY 
ALLEGED THAT SUPPORTERS OF THE AGREEMENT IN THE GOVERNMENT 
WERE \"COLLABORATORS\" OF THE SLOVENES. 
 
4. THERE WAS ALSO SOME CONSTERNATION IN THE PARLIAMENT AND IN 
THE PRESS OVER A PROVISION OF THE SLOVENIAN LAW OF 
RATIFICATION, WHICH CAME AS AN ATTACHMENT TO THE DIPLOMATIC 
NOTE.  THE PROVISION APPARENTLY CITES EU REGULATIONS AS 
REQUIRING A SHORTER TIMELINE FOR DETERMINING FINAL 
DISPOSITION FOR THE NUCLEAR WASTE FROM THE PLANT.  WHILE THE 
PRESS CHOSE TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF THIS PROVISION, AND EVEN 
CLAIMED THAT IT INCREASED THE POSSIBILITY THAT CROATIA MIGHT 
ONE DAY HAVE TO STORE THE WASTE, THE GOVERNMENT EXPLAINED 
THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT CHANGED CROATIA\'S 
OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THE TEXT OF THE 
AGREEMENT ITSELF.  IF SLOVENIA WANTED TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL 
BURDENS, THAT WAS ITS PREROGATIVE. 
 
5. FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, IT IS 
CLEAR THAT CROATIA HAS NO INTENTION OF EVER STORING THE WASTE 
ON ITS TERRITORY.  ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT, CROATIA AND 
SLOVENIA SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINDING A PERMANENT 
SOLUTION TO THE DISPOSAL PROBLEM (CURRENTLY, WASTE IS STORED 
ON-SITE AT KRSKO), AND A PROGRAM FOR THE DECOMMISSIONING OF 
THE PLANT SHOULD BE DRAFTED WITHIN 12 MONTHS FROM THE ENTRY 
INTO FORCE OF THE AGREEMENT.  IF THE PARTIES FAIL TO REACH 
    AGREEMENT ON DISPOSAL OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE BY THE END OF THE 
PLANT\'S LIFE (NOW SET FOR 2023, BUT WITH AN EXTENSION 
POSSIBLE), THEN WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THE PLANT\'S 
DECOMMISSIONING, BOTH PARTIES ARE OBLIGED TO STORE THE WASTE 
IN A 50-50 DIVISION.  CROATIA HAS NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING 
THAT TO COME TO PASS, AND OUR CONTACT IN THE MINISTRY OF 
ECONOMY PREDICTED THAT ULTIMATELY THE WASTE WILL END UP IN A 
THIRD COUNTRY.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, HR, IZ 
SUBJECT: TFIZ01: CROATIAN PARLIAMENT DEBATES IRAQ: NO 
SURPRISES 
 
REF: ZAGREB 669 
 
    1.  ON MARCH 26, CROATIA\'S PARLIAMENT DEBATED THE GOC 
POSITION ON IRAQ.  DEBATE WAS LIMITED BY A STRUCTURE AGREED 
IN ADVANCE BY PARLIAMENT LEADERS ON MARCH 21.  AT THE 
BEGINNING OF \"QUESTION TIME,\" PM RACAN DELIVERED A BRIEF 
REPORT; PARTY LEADERS THEN HAD FIVE MINUTES EACH TO RESPOND. 
PM RACAN\'S \"REPORT\" TRACKED CLOSELY WITH THE POSITION HE 
RELAYED PRIVATELY TO THE AMBASSADOR IN THEIR MARCH 24 MEETING 
(REFTEL).  RACAN REPEATED HIS EXPRESSION OF \"REGRET\" AT THE 
LACK OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY UNITY OVER IRAQ.  HE PUBLICLY 
ANNOUNCED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S READINESS TO SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORTS IN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, PEACEKEEPING AND POST-WAR 
RENEWAL OF IRAQ.  RACAN CALLED FOR A \"REVITALIZATION\" OF UN 
AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL BODIES AND SAID THAT THE UN SHOULD 
HAVE THE LEAD IN REBUILDING IRAQ. 
 
2.  LEADERS OF COALITION PARTIES GENERALLY BACKED THE GOC. 
VESNA PUSIC (HNS) SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH 
DEVELOPING AND THEN STICKING TO A CONSISTENT POSITION. 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE USG HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED; THE ONLY 
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE WAS CROATIA\'S DECISION NOT TO BE LISTED 
AS A MEMBER OF THE COALITION SUPPORTING MILITARY ACTION IN 
IRAQ.  JOZO RADOS (LIBRA) SAID THAT THE LOCAL MEDIA HAS 
EXAGGERATED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGREED GOC LINE AND 
PRESIDENT MESIC\'S SPEECH.  ZLATKO KRAMARIC (LS) SAID 
CROATIA\'S POSITIONS ON THE EU AND THE U.S. MUST BE REDEFINED, 
HOPED THAT THE U.N WOULD NOT REGRESS TO THE LEAGUE OF 
NATIONS, AND HOPED THAT TERRORISM WOULD NOT SPILL OVER TO 
\"OUR REGION.\"  LUKA TRCONIC (HSS) EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT 
DAMAGE DONE TO THE UN, ON WHICH \"SMALL NATIONS LIKE CROATIA\" 
RELY. 
 
    3.  THE OPPOSITION REACTION TO THE PM\'S REPORT WAS MIXED. 
THE HDZ -- THE ONLY PARTY TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT THE USE OF 
FORCE TO DISARM IRAQ -- DID NOT USE THEIR RIGHT OF REPLY. 
HDZ WHIP VLADIMIR SEKS SAID HIS PARTY HAD \"PUBLICLY SHARED 
ITS VIEWS ON THE IRAQI CRISIS AND HAD NOTHING TO ADD TO ITS 
POSITIONS.\"  DC PRESIDENT MATE GRANIC CRITICIZED A LACK OF 
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT MESIC ON 
IRAQ, WONDERING WHY THE (STILL NOT ESTABLISHED) NATIONAL 
SECURITY COUNCIL HAD NOT BEEN USED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. 
GRANIC COMMENDED THE HIGH LEVEL OF UNITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
AND MOST POLITICAL PARTIES REACHED ON THE NEED OF UNSC 
APPROVAL OF THE MILITARY ACTION.  IDS LEADER DAMIR KAJIN 
ACCUSED PRESIDENT BUSH OF \"LOSING TOUCH WITH REALITY\" AND 
STARTING A \"UNILATERAL\" ACTION THAT WILL PRODUCE MORE 
ANTI-AMERICANISM. 
 
4.  DRAZEN BUDISA (HSLS) SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD 
RECONSIDER ITS FOREIGN POLICY GOALS IN THE LIGHT OF NEW 
DIVISIONS.  RESPONDING TO RACAN\'S DECLARATION THAT CROATIA 
WOULD SEEK TO PARTICIPATE IN POST-CONFLICT ACTIVITIES, BUDISA 
SAID THAT \"CROATIA SHOULD NOT BE JOINING THE COUNTRIES WHICH 
WILL REBUILD IRAQ, BUT THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO STOP THE 
WAR.\"  THE ONLY FIREWORKS OF THE \"QUESTION TIME\" SESSION WERE 
PROVIDED BY THE HDZ RIGHT-WING EXTREMIST LJUBO CESIC ROJS, 
WHO ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS NOISILY INTERJECTED HIS 
READINESS TO JOIN THE US-LED MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ.

BEEN CONVEYED TO THE AMBASSADOR BY SIMONOVIC, AND SAID OUR 
REPORTS FROM GENEVA WERE THAT THEIR DELEGATION WAS STILL 
INTENDING TO ABSTAIN.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO NOTED INDICATIONS 
REPORTED BY GENEVA THAT THE EU WOULD OPPOSE.  KOVACIC 
RECONFIRMED THE GOC STANCE WAS \"NO, BUT WE WILL FOLLOW THE EU

WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH HIS DELEGATION IN GENEVA. 
 
2. (C) KOVACIC CALLED THE CROATIAN DELEGATION IN GENEVA AND 
THEN CALLED US BACK TO CONFIRM -- THEIR CURRENT INSTRUCTION 
IS TO OPPOSE, TO VOTE \"NO\" -- NOT \"ABSTAIN.\"  WERE THE EU TO

REF: ZAGREB 617 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) NATO SECRETARY GENERAL ROBERTSON VISITED CROATIA FOR 
A BRIEF STOPOVER ON MARCH 31.  IN MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT 
MESIC, PM RACAN AND KEY CABINET MEMBERS AND WITH PARLIAMENT 
LEADERS, ROBERTSON DELIVERED A GENTLE MESSAGE, ENCOURAGING 
CROATIA TO STAY ON TRACK WITH REFORMS IDENTIFIED UNDER THE 
MAP PROGRAM.  RACAN WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC, CHOD 
LUSIC AS WELL AS DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SIMONOVIC.  STJEPAN 
BARTULICA, HEAD OF THE MFA\'S NATO OFFICE, MET WITH US ON 
APRIL 1 TO DESCRIBE THE MEETING WITH RACAN. 
 
2.  (C) IN A LENGTHY OPENING, RACAN EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT 
THE LACK OF UNITY ON IRAQ AT NATO.  BARTULICA SAID THAT 
ROBERTSON WOULD NOT BE DRAWN INTO A DISCUSSION ON THE 
SUBSTANCE OF IRAQ, BUT SHARED RACAN\'S CONCERN AND HOPED 
THINGS WOULD BE SET RIGHT AT THE NAC QUICKLY.  BARTULICA TOLD 
US RACAN WAS ADVISED IN THE PRE-BRIEF TO PREEMPT DISCUSSION 
OF FUGITIVE ICTY INDICTEE GOTOVINA BY DECLARING THAT IN THE 
WAKE OF THE DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION, CROATIA BELIEVES THE TIME 
IS RIGHT TO MOVE AGAINST PIFWCS IN THE FRY AND RS.  BARTULICA 
SAID ROBERTSON\'S ONLY MESSAGE ON COOPERATION WITH THE HAGUE 
WAS AN EXPRESSION OF \"UNDERSTANDING\" FOR THE DIFFICULTY OF 
THE ISSUE; GOTOVINA WAS NOT RAISED. 
 
3.  (C) SYG ROBERTSON TOLD RACAN THAT CROATIA IS MAKING GOOD, 
STEADY PROGRESS IN MAP, AND IS A \"BEACON\" IN A DARK REGION OF 
    EUROPE.  CROATIA SHOULD USE THE MAP REVIEW PROCESS AS A 
ROADMAP FOR REFORMS.  HE HAILED THE UPCOMING SIGNING OF THE 
ADRIATIC CHARTER, AND HOPED THAT IT WOULD SPEED PROGRESS 
TOWARD MEMBERSHIP.  HE PRESSED THE CROATIANS TO DO BETTER ON 
BUILDING AND MAINTAINING PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THEIR BID FOR 
MEMBERSHIP.  HE RAISED REFUGEE RETURNS, BUT GENTLY: NATO 
ISN\'T PRESSING THE GOC TO ENSURE ALL ACTUALLY RETURN, IT MUST 
MERELY CREATE THE CONDITIONS WHEREBY REFUGEES CAN RETURN IF 
THEY WISH TO. 
 
4.  (C) BARTULICA SAID THAT THEY EXPECTED A MUCH TOUGHER 
MESSAGE FROM SYG ROBERTSON.  THE TEXT OF A DECEMBER 2002 
LETTER FROM THE SYG (LEAKED TO THE LOCAL PRESS) TO PM RACAN 
LAMBASTED THE GOC ON FAILING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON DEFENSE 
REFORM AND DOWNSIZING.  BARTULICA SPECULATED THAT THE 
DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION HAS PROMPTED INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPALS 
TO BACK OFF OF THEIR TOUGH LINE ON CROATIA. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C) WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT SYG ROBERTSON MAY HAVE LEFT 
SOME IN THE GOC WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT ASSASSINATION OF PM 
DJINDJIC MAY BE ENCOURAGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO 
EASE UP THE PRESSURE ON REFORMS.  WHEN EC COMMISSIONER PATTEN 
WAS IN ZAGREB FOR A TRUNCATED VISIT (SO HE COULD VISIT 
BELGRADE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION), HE 
TOLD THE LOCAL EC HOM THAT INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON SERBIA 
MAY HAVE BEEN TOO HARSH AND COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO 
DJINDJIC\'S ASSASSINATION (REFTEL). 
 
    6.  (C) WE DISAGREE STRONGLY WITH THE PREMISE THAT STRONG IC 
PRESSURE ADDS TO INSTABILITY.  THE DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION DID 
NOT CHANGE THE ISSUES HERE OR THE REASONS WE ARE PUSHING THE 
RACAN GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THEM.  REAL PROGRESS ON 
OUTSTANDING WAR LEGACY ISSUES LIKE ICTY COOPERATION AND 
REFUGEE RETURNS WOULD BE PROGRESS TOWARD BUILDING LONG-TERM 
STABILITY IN THE REGION.

TAGS: PREL, PHUM, HR, IZ 
SUBJECT: TFIZ01: CROATIAN CABINET ORDERS HUMANITARIAN 
CONTRIBUTION FOR IRAQ 
 
 
1.  (U) ON APRIL 3, THE CROATIAN CABINET PASSED A DECISION 
(SEE TEXT AT PARA 4) TO SEND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE WITH A 
VALUE OF JUST UNDER USD 3 MILLION TO IRAQ.  THE ASSISTANCE 
SHOULD INCLUDE BLANKETS, SLEEPING BAGS, BED LINENS, FLOUR, 
SUGAR, AND WATER PURIFICATION AGENTS.  THE CABINET ALSO 
DIRECTED THE GOC TO CONSIDER SENDING \"EXPERT ASSISTANCE\" TO 
SUPPORT HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN IRAQ. 
 
2.  (SBU) ON APRIL 4 WE MET WITH ANDREA BEKIC OF THE MFA\'S 
NORTH AMERICAN DESK TO SEEK FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE 
CROATIAN CONTRIBUTION.  BEKIC INSISTED THAT CROATIA WANTS TO 
BE SEEN -- PARTICULARLY BY THE U.S. -- AS DOING ITS PART FOR 
POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION.  THE MFA HAD BEEN TASKED BY THE 
SENIOR-LEVEL \"CRISIS COMMITTEE\" TO FIND WAYS TO TRANSPORT THE 
CARGO.  GIVEN PAST DIFFICULTIES, WE MADE SURE SHE UNDERSTOOD 
THAT ORGANIZING AIRLIFT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT; THE GOC 
SHOULD NOT/NOT COUNT ON A POSITIVE RESPONSE IF IT APPROACHES 
THE USG WITH A REQUEST FOR AIRLIFT. 
 
3.   (SBU) BEKIC SAID THAT CROATIA\'S MISSION TO NATO WAS 
MAKING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COLLEAGUES IN BRUSSELS FOR DELIVERY 
OF PART OF THE DONATION TO TURKEY.  THE REST OF THE DONATION 
IS DESIGNATED FOR USE IN IRAQ.  WE SUGGESTED THAT OTHER 
COUNTRIES INTERESTED IN MAKING AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION ARE MAKING MONETARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
    NGO\'S ALREADY ACTIVE IN THE REGION.  CROATIA\'S EMBASSY IN 
WASHINGTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED AT THE WEEKLY 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE MEETINGS. 
 
4.  (U) BEGIN TEXT OF THE GOC APRIL 5 DECISION (NOTE INTERNAL 
NUMBERING): 
 
(I)  ABOUT 20 MILLION KUNA (USD 2.85 MILLION) WORTH OF 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE SHALL BE SENT TO THE WAR-AFFECTED 
POPULATION IN IRAQ. 
 
(II)  THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE SHALL BE SENT AS NEEDED AND 
POSSIBLE TO DISTRIBUTE. 
 
(III)  THE ASSISTANCE SHALL CONSIST OF BLANKETS, TENTS, 
SLEEPING BAGS, FLOUR, SUGAR, FIELD BEDS, BED LINEN, AND 
WATER-PURIFICATION AGENTS. 
 
(IV)  THE CRISIS COMMITTEE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA SHALL 
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DECISION. 
 
(V)  THE CRISIS COMMITTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA IS 
INSTRUCTED TO CONSIDER SENDING EXPERT ASSISTANCE AIMED AT 
ALLEVIATING THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR IN IRAQ.

1.   (C) SUMMARY: FOR CROATIA, UNRAVELING THE LIABILITIES AND 
ASSETS OF THE SUCCESSOR STATES OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA 
CONTINUES TO HINGE ON SECURING A RATIFIED AGREEMENT ON 
SUCCESSION ISSUES (ASI).  ON APRIL 4, ZDRAVKO ROGIC, SENIOR 
CROATIAN REPRESENTATIVE ON THE SUCCESSOR STATES\' FINANCE 
COMMITTEE, REPEATED WHAT HE AND OTHERS IN THE GOC HAVE SAID 
TO US ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ALREADY: EVEN IF THE GOVERNMENT 
WANTED TO, IT COULD NOT PROVIDE A HOLD HARMLESS TO ENABLE 
DISPERSAL OF NBY ASSETS TO SUCCESSOR STATES BY THE APRIL 15 
U.S.-IMPOSED DEADLINE BEFORE OFAC PROCEEDS WITH A GENERAL 
UNBLOCKING.  CROATIA WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BLOCKED NBY ASSETS 
DISPERSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER AN ASI IS RATIFIED, ROGIC 
CONTINUED, BUT A HOLD HARMLESS WOULD BE A LEGAL 
\"IMPOSSIBILITY.\"  MOREOVER, HE SAID, DEALS WORKED OUT WITH 
THIRD COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ONE SIGNED WITH RUSSIA LAST WEEK, 
ARE PREDICATED ON HAVING A RATIFIED SUCCESSION AGREEMENT.  NO 
DISPURSEMENTS COULD BE MADE BY MOSCOW UNTIL CROATIA RATIFIES 
THE ASI. END SUMMARY 
 
HOLD HARMLESS IMPOSSIBLE 
------------------------ 
 
2.   (C) ZDRAVKO ROGIC, DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF THE CROATIAN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00755  01 OF 02  042043Z 
CENTRAL BANK AND THE GOC\'S REPRESENTATIVE ON THE SUCCESSOR 
STATES\' FINANCIAL COMMITTEE, WAS IN FAMILIAR FORM DURING A 
MEETING APRIL 4.  HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM SKOPJE, WHERE THE 
FINANCIAL COMMITTEE HAD JUST CONCLUDED A TOUGH SESSION. 
ROGIC SAID CROATIA\'S STAND WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. REQUEST 
FOR A HOLD HARMLESS TO ENABLE RELEASE OF FROZEN NBY ASSETS 
REMAINED ABSOLUTELY UNCHANGED.  HE REPEATED ALL THE ARGUMENTS 
HE HAS MADE BEFORE, AND CLAIMED OTHER SUCCESSOR STATES 
REMAINED UPSET ABOUT THE U.S. DECISION TO GO FORWARD WITH A 
GENERAL UNBLOCKING ON APRIL 15 ABSENT A HOLD HARMLESS.  THE 
U.S., PERHAPS THE WORLD\'S \"MOST LEGALISTIC STATE,\" HE SAID, 
WANTS TO PUSH FORWARD HERE IN A NON-LEGAL FASHION TO UNBLOCK 
EVEN THOUGH CROATIA HAS NOT RATIFIED THE ASI.  THE U.S. WANTS 
THE GOC TO PROVIDE A HOLD HARMLESS EVEN THOUGH, BY PROVIDING 
IT, THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD BE USURPING THE AUTHORITY 
OF THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT. 
 
3.   (C) ROGIC REPEATED POINTS HE AND COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE ON 
MANY OCCASIONS TO US, IN PARTICULAR THAT AUTHORITIES IN 
BELGRADE CONTINUE TO REFUSE THE CROATIANS AND OTHER SUCCESSOR 
STATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE BOOKS OF THE NBY TO 
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO $589 MILLION THAT HAD GONE MISSING 
FROM JOINT VENTURE BANKS.  \"WE NEED YOUR HELP IN TRACKING 
DOWN THIS MONEY,\" HE REPEATED.  WHY DO AUTHORITIES IN 
BELGRADE REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH US?  \"IT\'S IN THEIR 
INTEREST TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS\" BECAUSE THE MONEY MOST 
LIKELY WAS STOLEN BY MILOSEVIC\'S PEOPLE.  ROGIC SAID AGAIN 
THAT CROATIA DOES NOT WANT COMPENSATION FOR THE MISSING MONEY 
-- IN THE FORM OF AN ALTERED KEY OR ANY OTHER WAY -- BUT 
MERELY WANTED A FULL ACCOUNTING THAT WOULD ENABLE THE 
GOVERNMENT TO SUBMIT THE ASI TO THE PARLIAMENT.

RUSSIAN DEBT: NOT SO FAST 
------------------------- 
 
4.   (C) WE ASKED ROGIC ABOUT THE DEAL WORKED OUT IN MOSCOW 
OVER THE RUSSIAN DEBT (REF A), AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER IN 
USING THE ASI KEY THE CROATIANS HAD ADOPTED A DOUBLE 
STANDARD.  THE KEY, UNDER WHICH CROATIA GETS 23 PERCENT OF 
ANY PAYOFF TO SFRY SUCCESSOR STATES, WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO BE 
USED FOR DISBURSING RUSSIAN DEBTS BUT NOT FOR DISBURSING 
BLOCKED NBY MONEY.  ROGIC POINTED OUT RATHER EMPHATICALLY 
THAT THE DEAL BROKERED IN MOSCOW IS PREDICATED ON THE VIENNA 
ASI COMING INTO FULL FORCE.  BEFORE ANY MONEY COULD BE 
DISBURSED, HE STRESSED, ALL SUCCESSOR STATES WOULD HAVE TO 
RATIFY THE VIENNA AGREEMENT.  ASKED IF HE EXPECTED MOSCOW, A 
HISTORICAL FRIEND OF BELGRADE\'S, TO HOLD UP DISBURSING MONEY 
TO SERBIA UNTIL CROATIA RATIFIED THE ASI, ROGIC SAID 
\"ABSOLUTELY.\"  AND IF RUSSIA DISBURSES THE MONEY BEFORE THE 
ASI COMES INTO EFFECT, ROGIC SAID HE EXPECTED THE U.S., AS A 
STATE RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW, TO SUPPORT THE CROATIAN 
POSITION -- ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SAY HOW.

5.   (C) ROGIC CAME ACROSS AS CLEARLY FRUSTRATED.  HE 
CONTINUES TO SAY (OVER AND OVER AGAIN) THAT HE CANNOT 
UNDERSTAND WHY THE U.S. IS PUSHING SO HARD TO DISBURSE THE 
MONEY FROZEN UNDER THE SERBIA SANCTIONS PROGRAM -- ALTHOUGH 
HE RETURNED TO AN ACCUSATION MADE MONTHS AGO THAT THIS 
INITIATIVE IS ALL ABOUT A PROMISE THE SECRETARY MADE TO 
BELGRADE AUTHORITIES LAST YEAR TO RETURN FROZEN ASSETS TO 
THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS.  EVEN IF ROGIC\'S RESPONSE ABOUT THE 
HOLD HARMLESS REMAINS UNCHANGED, HE SOUNDED MORE CONCILIATORY 
CONCERNING COMPENSATION.  HE KNOWS THAT THE $589 MILLION THAT 
WENT MISSING AFTER THE ASI WAS SIGNED WAS PROBABLY STOLEN BY 
MILOSEVIC AND HIS CRONIES YEARS AGO.  AS SUCH, CROATIA IS NOT 
ASKING FOR COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF A HIGHER PERCENTAGE IN 
THE KEY OR ANYTHING ELSE.  BUT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SEND 
AN ASI TO THE PARLIAMENT THAT REFLECTS REALITY -- OR SO HE 
ASSERTED TO US. 
 
6.   (C) WHEN ROGIC INSISTS THAT NONE OF THE RUSSIAN DEBT 
COULD BE DISBURSED UNTIL THE ASI ENTERED INTO EFFECT, WE 
PRESUME HE IS REFERRING TO LANGUAGE IN ARTICLE 8 OF THE 
MEMORANDUM BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE SFRY 
SUCCESSOR STATES.  THAT SAYS THAT THE DEAL SHALL COME INTO 
FORCE AFTER \"ALL THE REQUIRED INTRA-STATE AND INTER-STATE 
PROCEDURES\" HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN.  IT IS UNCLEAR IF ROGIC 
REALLY BELIEVES THAT RUSSIA -- WHICH HE COMPLAINED SHOWED 
BIAS IN MOSCOW TOWARD THE BELGRADE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE 
NEGOTIATIONS -- WILL DUTIFULLY WAIT FOR THE CROATIAN 
PARLIAMENT TO RATIFY THE ASI BEFORE DISBURSING ANY OF ITS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00755  02 OF 02  042044Z 
DEBTS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, ROGIC\'S COMMENTS INDICATED THAT AN 
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN MOSCOW AND 
THE SUCCESSOR STATES REMAINS OVER SETTLING ACCOUNTS, AND 
MOSCOW MAY NOT BE IN SUCH A RUSH TO HONOR DEBTS IF IT HAS A 
GOOD EXCUSE TO SIT ON ITS HANDS.

DEADLINES 
 
REF: ZAGREB 717 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF ROB SILBERSTEIN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) ICTY ZAGREB RESREP THOMAS OSORIO TOLD US LATE APRIL 4 
THAT THE GOC APPEARS TO HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE HAGUE\'S APRIL 
4 DEADLINES TO SERVE THE SEPTEMBER 2002 INDICTMENT ON GENERAL 
JANKO BOBETKO OR HIS LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE AND TO HONOR OTP 
DOCUMENT REQUESTS.  OSORIO SAID HE WAS INFORMED THAT 
OFFICIALS FROM THE GOC OFFICE FOR COOPERATION WITH THE 
TRIBUNAL SERVED THE INDICTMENT ON BOBETKO\'S ATTORNEY.  THE 
CROATIAN AMBASSADOR IN THE HAGUE HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED TO 
INFORM THE ICTY REGISTRAR OF CROATIA\'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
ICTY JUDGE\'S ORDER ON THE BOBETKO CASE.  THE GOC DECISION TO 
SERVE THE INDICTMENT CAME AFTER THE PRESIDING JUDGE IN THE 
ZAGREB COUNTY COURT, CITING BOBETKO\'S SEVERE MEDICAL 
CONDITION, REFUSED TO SERVE THE INDICTMENT. 
 
2. (C) OSORIO ALSO CONFIRMED THAT AMBASSADOR KRNIC, HEAD OF 
THE GOC OFFICE FOR COOPERATION, TRANSMITTED LATE APRIL 4 A 
THICK SET OF DOCUMENTS ON CROATIAN MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN 
BOSNIA DURING THE WAR.  THE PACKAGE ALSO CONTAINED A LETTER 
OF COMMITMENT, BINDING THE GOC TO PROVIDE OUTSTANDING BANKING 
DOCUMENTS.  OSORIO SAID THAT THE OTP HAS INFORMED THE GOC 
THAT CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE HAS ACCEPTED THE GOC OFFER TO 
VISIT ZAGREB.  DEL PONTE HAS PROPOSED APRIL 17 FOR THE VISIT. 

3. (C) BARRING A MIRACULOUS RECOVERY BY THE 83-YEAR OLD 
GENERAL, THE GOC\'S SERVING OF THE INDICTMENT EFFECTIVELY 
CLOSES THE BOBETKO CASE.  ALTHOUGH THE GOC APPEARS TO HAVE 
RESPONDED ADEQUATELY TO THE OTP DOCUMENT DEADLINE, THE DEVIL 
IS IN THE DETAILS.  OSORIO SAID THAT THE  TRIBUNAL 
INVESTIGATORS NOW MUST ANALYZE THE CONTENTS OF THE GOC 
SUBMISSION.  A PACKAGE OF DOCUMENTS THAT OSORIO HAD REVIEWED 
INFORMALLY ON APRIL 1 AT CROATIAN MOD ARCHIVES DID NOT 
FULFILL OTP NEEDS.  THE OTP WOULD COMPLETE ITS ANALYSIS OF 
THE GOC SUBMISSION BY APRIL 10. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4. (C) ACCORDING TO OSORIO, THE GOC\'S SERVING OF THE 
INDICTMENT, PARTICULARLY AFTER MAINTAINING THAT THIS WAS THE 
ROLE OF THE CROATIAN COURTS, IS SIGNIFICANT.  BY DOING SO -- 
IN OSORIO\'S VIEW -- THE GOC ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE TRIBUNAL 
HAS PRIMACY OVER THE RULINGS OF CROATIAN COURTS.  TIME WILL 
TELL AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE GOC AGREES THAT ITS ACTION IS 
PRECEDENT SETTING.  WHAT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, IS THAT WITH THE 
U.S. AND EU MAKING IT CLEAR THAT ICTY COOPERATION IS A SIN 
QUA NON FOR EURO-ATLANTIC INTEGRATION, AND WITH PM RACAN 
SCHEDULED TO TRAVEL TO ATHENS ON APRIL 15 TO GET THE EU\'S 
\"AVIS,\" THE ICTY/OTP FIRM DEADLINES NO DOUBT SPURRED A 
RELUCTANT GOC TO ACT.

CLASSIFIED BY: NICHOLAS HILL, POLITICAL-ECONOMIC COUNSELOR, FOR REASONS 
 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.   (C) ON APRIL 5, A DAY AFTER THE RACAN GOVERNMENT 
DELIVERED AN ICTY INDICTMENT TO GENERAL JANKO BOBETKO THROUGH 
HIS LAWYER (REFTEL), IT TOOK INTO CUSTODY IVICA RAJIC, A 
BOSNIAN CROAT AND FORMER COMMANDER OF THE CROAT DEFENSE 
COUNCIL (HVO), WHO HAS BEEN WANTED BY THE TRIBUNAL ON WAR 
CRIMES CHARGES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  THOMAS OSORIO, HEAD OF THE 
ICTY LIAISON OFFICE IN ZAGREB, TOLD US ON APRIL 7 THAT HIS 
OFFICE HAD BEEN HOPEFUL ABOUT THE RAJIC ARREST, BUT WAS 
SURPRISED BY THE TIMING.  PM RACAN HAD PROMISED CHIEF 
PROSECUTOR CARLA DEL PONTE BACK IN OCTOBER ON HER LAST VISIT 
TO CROATIA THAT AUTHORITIES WOULD NAB RAJIC, BUT THERE HAD 
BEEN NO SPECIFIC NEWS RECENTLY. 
 
2.   (C) ACCORDING TO OSORIO, IN CONTRAST TO OTHER INDICTED 
WAR CRIMINALS -- SUCH AS ANTE GOTOVINA AND EVEN BOBETKO -- 
RAJIC HAS NO SIZABLE FOLLOWING, OR IN OSORIO\'S WORDS, \"FAN 
CLUB\" IN CROATIA.  AND AS A BOSNIAN CROAT, HIS ARREST IS 
VIEWED HERE AS MUCH LESS CONTROVERSIAL.  RAJIC IS A 
\"PSYCHOPATH\" AND REPRESENTED THE \"WORST OF THE WORST,\" OSORIO 
SAID.  RAJIC WAS INDICTED FOR THE KILLING OF 16 CIVILIANS IN 
THE CENTRAL BIH TOWN OF STUPNI DO IN 1995.  HE HAD BEEN 
PROTECTED BY THE TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT AND OFFERED FALSE 
DOCUMENTS.  HE HAD REPORTEDLY FLED CROATIA, BUT REPORTS ABOUT 
    HIS RETURN BEGAN CIRCULATING LAST YEAR.  THE POLICE HAVE BEEN 
TRACKING HIS ACTIVITIES AND MONITORING HIS FAMILY\'S 
TELEPHONES.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, HIS LOCATION WAS 
UNCOVERED DURING THE COURSE OF THE ONGOING SEARCH FOR 
GOTOVINA. 
 
3.   (C) CHIEF OF POLICE RANKO OSTOJIC TOLD US ON APRIL 7 
THAT THE ARREST CAME AFTER AN 8-MONTH INVESTIGATION. 
ACCORDING TO OSTOJIC, FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROTECTING LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, THE POLICE TOLD THE PRESS THAT RAJIC 
WAS ARRESTED IN ZAGREB.  IN TRUTH, HOWEVER, THE FUGITIVE WAS 
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY IN SPLIT.  OSTOJIC TOLD US THAT 
AUTHORITIES WANT TO \"DISMANTLE\" THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE 
INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT THAT HAS PROTECTED SUSPECTED WAR 
CRIMINALS.  OSTOJIC NOTED THAT RAJIC\'S WIFE, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS 
HIRED BY THE PREVIOUS REGIME AND CONTINUES TO WORK FOR THE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IN SPLIT.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION 
--------------------------- 
 
1. (C) MINISTER OF JUSTICE ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC TOLD US ON 
APRIL 2 THAT THE GOC IS COMMITTED TO PASSING QUICKLY 
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF CROATIAN COURTS 
TO PROCESS WAR CRIMES.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE MINISTER\'S 
ASSURANCES, OTHER KEY PLAYERS -- INCLUDING THE DRAFTER OF THE 
MOST CURRENT VERSION OF THE DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES LEGISLATION 
-- WERE SKEPTICAL THAT A WAR CRIMES BILL WOULD SEE THE LIGHT 
OF DAY SOON.  THEY TOLD US THE GOC, IN AN ELECTION YEAR, IS 
TOO SKITTISH TO ACT IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION FROM THE 
RIGHT-WING AND FROM JUDGES (ONE OF CROATIA\'S MOST 
REFORM-RESISTANT GUILDS). 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00790  01 OF 03  091557Z 
 
2. (C) AS WE HAVE REPORTED (REFS C AND D), WITHOUT A 
STRENGTHENED LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK AND STRONG POLITICAL 
SUPPORT, CROATIA\'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS LARGELY 
INCAPABLE OF PROSECUTING WAR CRIMES FAIRLY AND EFFECTIVELY. 
THE BOTTOM LINE FOR US IS THAT WITHOUT THE FRAMEWORK THAT NEW 
LEGISLATION WOULD PROVIDE, THE USD TWO MILLION IN REGIONAL 
SEED ASSISTANCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS IDENTIFIED FOR A 
CROATIA WAR CRIMES PROJECT COULD NOT BE USED EFFICIENTLY. 
 
3. (C) THE TIME IS NOT RIPE FOR A VISIT OF A LARGE TECHNICAL 
TEAM OF EXPERTS TO ZAGREB TO DEVELOP A WAR CRIMES ACTION PLAN 
FOR THE SEED FUNDING:  THE TEAM HAS NO CONCRETE BASIS ON 
WHICH TO WORK.  HOWEVER, A RETURN VISIT OF S/WCI AMBASSADOR 
PROSPER TO ZAGREB IN EARLY- TO MID-MAY COULD HELP PRESS THE 
GOC TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES LEGISLATION AND 
ADVANCE OUR BROADER ICTY COMPLETION STRATEGY.  SUCH A VISIT 
WOULD BE PARTICULARLY TIMELY NOW THAT THE GOC HAS TAKEN 
POSITIVE STEPS TO CORRECT THE COURSE OF ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH 
THE ICTY TRIBUNAL (REFS A AND B).  END SUMMARY. 
 
PRESSING THE GOC ON DOMESTIC WAR CRIME PROSECUTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4. (C) WE MET ON APRIL 2 WITH MINISTER OF JUSTICE INGRID 
ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC AND ASSISTANT MINISTER OF JUSTICE FOR 
CRIMINAL AFFAIRS DUBRAVKO PALIJAS TO REVIEW GOC PLANS TO 
IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES TRIALS.  WE 
TOLD THE MINISTER THAT, PURSUANT TO S/WCI AMBASSADOR 
PROSPER\'S DISCUSSIONS IN ZAGREB IN JULY 2002 (REF F), THE USG 
HAS IDENTIFIED USD TWO MILLION IN ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00790  01 OF 03  091557Z 
CROATIAN EFFORTS.  WE TOLD THE MINISTER THAT WASHINGTON IS 
PREPARED TO DISPATCH A TEAM OF EXPERTS TO DEVELOP A 
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR THE FUNDS THAT WE WOULD PRESENT TO THE 
GOC FOR COMMENT AND APPROVAL.  HOWEVER, AS A FIRST STEP, WE 
WANTED TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE THE GOC STANDS IN 
PASSING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FACILITATE LOCAL PROSECUTIONS 
AND THE WORK OF THE EXPERT TEAM. 
 
5. (C) WE TOLD THE MINISTER THAT DESPITE THE POSITIVE 
HANDLING OF THE GOSPIC WAR CRIMES TRIAL (REF C), WE CONTINUED 
TO HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE 
CROATIAN COURTS TO PROSECUTE SENSITIVE WAR CRIMES FAIRLY AND 
IMPARTIALLY.  FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT, ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION 
WOULD BE TO CREATE A SINGLE WAR CRIMES COURT WITH HAND-PICKED 
JUDGES.  SUCH AN APPROACH WOULD ALLOW THE USG -- AND POSSIBLY 
OTHER DONORS -- TO CHANNEL ASSISTANCE EFFICIENTLY.  WE ALSO 
TOLD THE MINISTER THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES MUST BE 
GIVEN STRENGTHENED TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE WAR 
CRIMES.  IN PARTICULAR, THE GOC NEEDS TO PASS WITNESS 
PROTECTION LEGISLATION, AND TO GIVE PROSECUTORS MORE FREEDOM 
TO CONCLUDE PLEA BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH COOPERATIVE 
WITNESSES. 
 
6. (C) ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC TOLD US THAT THE GOC HAS BEEN 
DEBATING VARIOUS CONCEPTS OF A WAR CRIMES COURT FOR OVER TWO

TAGS: KAWC, KJUS, PREL, UNSC, ICTY, EAID, HR 
SUBJECT: ASSISTING CROATIA TO STRENGTHEN DOMESTIC WAR 
CRIMES PROSECUTIONS: RECOMMENDED WAY AHEAD 
 
YEARS.  IN FACT, ONE APPROACH, CONCEIVED BY A/M PALIJAS IN 
DECEMBER 2002, CALLED FOR THE CREATION OF A SINGLE WAR CRIMES 
COURT IN ZAGREB.  THE MINISTER SAID THAT SHE REJECTED THAT 
PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE THE GOC TO HIRE MORE JUDGES 
IN ZAGREB TO HANDLE THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD.  THE MOJ DOES 
NOT HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING.  RATHER, SHE ENVISIONED 
CENTRALIZING WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS IN CROATIA\'S FOUR MAJOR 
URBAN CENTERS:  ZAGREB, SPLIT, RIJEKA AND OSIJEK.  TO PREVENT 
BIASED JUDGES FROM RECEIVING WAR CRIMES CASES -- AS OCCURRED 
IN THE LORA WAR CRIMES TRIAL FIASCO (REF D) -- THE WAR CRIMES 
BILL WOULD GRANT THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT SPECIAL 
AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER CASES BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS AND TO 
SELECT THE JUDGES THAT WOULD TRY THE CASES. 
 
7. (C) THE MINISTER SAID THAT CROATIAN WAR CRIMES EXPERT, 
PROFESSOR IVO JOSIPOVIC, HAS BEEN TASKED WITH DEVELOPING A 
NEW DRAFT DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES BILL.  HIS DRAFT SHOULD BE 
READY BY THE END OF APRIL, ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC SAID.  SHE 
ANTICIPATED THAT THE GOC WOULD APPROVE THE DRAFT SOMETIME IN 
MAY AND THEN FORWARD IT TO PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL UNDER 
\"URGENT PROCEDURE,\" MEANING THAT THE LAW COULD BE ADOPTED BY 
MID-2003.  ADDITIONALLY, A WITNESS PROTECTION BILL -- DRAFTED 
IN COOPERATION WITH OUR DOJ/OPDAT RESIDENT LEGAL ADVISOR -- 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00790  02 OF 03  091558Z 
IS PENDING BEFORE THE GOC FOR APPROVAL. 
 
8. (C) AFTER OUR OPTIMISTIC MEETING WITH THE MINISTER, WE MET 
SEPARATELY WITH A/M PALIJAS.  DISPLAYING A RARE BURST OF 
EMOTION AND ANGER, PALIJAS (PROTECT) CRITICIZED HIS MINISTER 
AND THE GOC ON ITS APPROACH TO WAR CRIMES LEGISLATION. 
PALIJAS SAID THAT ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC INITIALLY AGREED THAT 
HIS SINGLE WAR CRIMES COURT PROPOSAL WOULD BE THE MOST 
EFFICIENT WAY TO STRENGTHEN LOCAL WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS. 
THE GOC REJECTED HIS APPROACH, NOT BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL 
CONCERNS, BUT BECAUSE THE GOC FEARS A SINGLE WAR CRIMES COURT 
WOULD BE A POLITICAL LIGHTNING ROD, HE EXPLAINED.  PALIJAS 
ALSO WAS SKEPTICAL THAT THE GOC WOULD PUT A DOMESTIC WAR 
CRIMES BILL ON THE SABOR FAST TRACK IN AN ELECTION YEAR.  HE 
SAID HE WOULD BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IF THE LAW WERE PASSED 
BY SEPTEMBER. 
 
9. (C) FOLLOWING UP ON OUR DISCUSSIONS IN THE MINISTRY OF 
JUSTICE, WE MET ON APRIL 3 WITH PROFESSOR JOSIPOVIC.  LIKE 
PALIJAS, JOSIPOVIC WAS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE GOC APPROVING A 
WAR CRIMES BILL ANY TIME SOON.  HE ADDED THAT \"THE GOC DOES 
NOT KNOW WHAT IT WANTS OTHER THAN TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL 
DOES NOT HAVE A HIGH POLITICAL PROFILE.\" 
 
10. (C) JOSIPOVIC SAID THAT HE PLACES MUCH OF THE BLAME ON 
THE COURTS FOR THE GENERAL FAILURE OF THE CROATIAN CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM TO TRY WAR CRIMES EFFECTIVELY.  IN PARTICULAR, 
SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT IVICA CRNIC HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE 
LEADERSHIP AND REIN IN RIGHT-WINGERS IN THE COURTS. 
CONSEQUENTLY, JOSIPOVIC\'S DRAFT BILL WILL GIVE PROSECUTORS, 
NOT THE SUPREME COURT, THE RIGHT TO DECIDE IN WHICH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00790  02 OF 03  091558Z 
PARTICULAR JURISDICTION TO TRY A WAR CRIMES CASE.  JOSIPOVIC 
EXPECTED STRONG OPPOSITION TO HIS DRAFT FROM THE 
INWARD-LOOKING JUDICIARY IN ADDITION TO THE EXPECTED CARPING 
FROM THE RIGHT-WING. 
 
COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION 
-------------------------- 
 
11. (C) THE GOC HAS BEEN WORKING FITFULLY ON A SPECIAL WAR 
CRIMES COURT FOR THE PAST TWO AND HALF YEARS.  IN THAT TIME, 
WE HAVE SEEN THREE DIFFERENT DRAFTS, ALL WITH THEIR PLUSSES 
AND MINUSES.  WHILE, IN OUR JUDGMENT, THE SINGLE ZAGREB-BASED 
COURT WOULD BE THE BEST OPTION, ANY OF THE OPTIONS THAT THE 
VARIOUS GOC DRAFTERS DEVELOPED WOULD PROVIDE US WITH AN 
ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH TO CHANNEL OUR ASSISTANCE.  THE 
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT, ALTHOUGH THE MINISTER\'S ASSURANCES THAT 
THE GOC IS COMMITTED TO PASSING QUICKLY SPECIAL WAR CRIMES 
LEGISLATION ARE WELCOME, UNTIL A DRAFT LAW IS APPROVED BY THE 
GOC AND FORWARDED TO PARLIAMENT, THERE IS NO BASIS FOR US TO 
MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ASSISTANCE PLAN.  ABSENT SPECIAL WAR 
CRIMES LEGISLATION THAT CREATES THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK FOR US TO 
TARGET OUR ASSISTANCE, WE RUN THE RISK OF FRITTERING AWAY OUR 
SCARCE ASSISTANCE DOLLARS.

WOULD HELP US TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR A FUTURE EXPERT TEAM 
VISIT BY PRESSING THE GOC TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DOMESTIC WAR

     B. TBILISI 778 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF ROB SILBERSTEIN, REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) WE HAVE NOT DETECTED ANY BLATANT EU PRESSURE ON THE 
GOC NOT TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH US. 
HOWEVER, FOR THE MOMENT, THE EU DOES NOT NEED TO STRONG-ARM 
    THE CROATIANS.  THE GOC IS NOWHERE NEAR TAKING A DECISION ON 
OPENING FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH US ON ARTICLE 98, LET ALONE 
READY TO CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT. 
 
2. (C) PRIME MINSTER RACAN TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON A NUMBER OF 
OCCASIONS THAT HE UNDERSTANDS OUR REQUIREMENTS AND IS WILLING 
TO REACH AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT.  THAT BEING SAID, RACAN AND 
OTHER GOC OFFICIALS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE GOC, WITH ITS 
EU AMBITIONS, DOES NOT WANT TO BE OUT IN FRONT OF THE EU AND 
IS WAITING TO SEE THE RESULTS OF OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH KEY EU 
STATES.  THE GOC\'S IDEA WOULD BE TO CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT 
MODELED ON WHATEVER THE USG AND EU STATES WORK OUT. 
 
3. (C) SOME LOCAL OBSERVERS HAVE QUESTIONED WHY THE GOC 
SHOULD TRANSFER CROATIAN CITIZENS TO THE ICTY WHILE GRANTING 
U.S. CITIZENS PROTECTION FROM THE ICC.  NEVERTHELESS, RACAN 
INDICATED TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT ICTY LINKAGES WOULD NOT/NOT 
BE AN OBSTACLE TO CONCLUDING AN AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, THE ICTY 
ISSUE COULD COMPLICATE PARLIAMENT RATIFICATION OF AN ARTICLE 
98 AGREEMENT -- PARTICULARLY IN AN ELECTION YEAR. 
 
4. (C) ON APRIL 5, ASSISTANT MINISTER OF DEFENSE JELENA 
GRCIC-POLIC TOLD US THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE 
GOC\'S WAIT-FOR-THE-EU APPROACH ON ARTICLE 98.  GRCIC-POLIC 
SAID MINISTER OF DEFENSE ZELJKA ANTUNOVIC WAS AWARE OF THE 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE CUTOFF IMPLICATIONS OF AMERICAN 
SERVICEMEBERS PROTECTION ACT (ASPA).  WHILE ANTUNOVIC WOULD 
SUPPORT EFFORTS TO REACH A DEAL, SHE WAS NOT A PLAYER ON THE 
ISSUE.  THE ASSISTANT MINISTER TOLD US THAT THERE WAS STRONG 
OPPOSITION TO AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT FROM THE OFFICE OF 
PRESIDENT MESIC.  MOREOVER, GRCIC-POLIC SAID THAT, WITHOUT 
    FIRM INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO PROCEED IN THE 
ABSENCE OF AN EU MODEL AGREEMENT, THE MFA WOULD NOT BEGIN 
NEGOTIATIONS, DESPITE THE JULY 1 ASPA DEADLINE. 
 
5. (C) GRCIC-POLIC SPECULATED THAT PRE-ELECTION MANEUVERING 
AND FEAR OF DAMAGING CROATIA\'S EU ASPIRATIONS -- BY JULY 1, 
CROATIA\'S APPLICATION WILL HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE 
COMMISSION FOR THE AVIS PROCESS -- WOULD LEAD RACAN TO FORGO 
IMET AND FMF FUNDING RATHER THAN CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT NOT 
SHIELDED BY PRIOR EU AGREEMENTS.  SHE FEARED THAT, IF A 
CUTOFF OCCURRED, RACAN AND MESIC WOULD SEEK TO MAKE POLITICAL 
HAY BY TRUMPETING GOC \"MORAL DECISIVENESS\" IN THE FACE OF 
U.S. PRESSURE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) WE WARNED GRCIC-POLIC THAT, WITH TIME HAVING PASSED, 
THE GOC STRATEGY OF WAITING FOR EU STATES TO TAKE THE LEAD IS 
FLAWED AND THE GOC SHOULD BEGIN NEGOTIATING WITH US IN 
EARNEST: BECAUSE THE ASPA EXEMPTS NATO MEMBERS FROM THE 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE CUTOFF, KEY EU STATES DO NOT FEEL A SENSE 
OF URGENCY.  WE ALSO CAUTIONED THAT A PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER 
SHOULD NOT BE PRESUMED.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO REMIND THE GOC 
OF THE IMPENDING JULY 1 DEADLINE AND URGE THEM TO BEGIN TO 
WORK QUIETLY AND CONSTRUCTIVELY TOWARDS AN AGREEMENT THAT 
SECURES US BILATERAL PROTECTION FROM THE ICC.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE PROJECT IS ONE POSSIBLE 
ROUTE TO BRING RUSSIAN OIL TO WESTERN MARKETS, SOMETHING 
WHICH WOULD ENHANCE GLOBAL ENERGY SECURITY BY INCREASING 
DIVERSIFICATION OF OIL SUPPLIES.  THE CROATIAN PRESS HAS 
SOUGHT TO PORTRAY CROATIA AS A NEW PLAYER IN WORLD OIL 
POLITICS.  HOWEVER, ACTUAL CROATIAN INFLUENCE ON THE SUCCESS 
OF THE PROJECT, AND THE UPFRONT INVESTMENT AND THUS RISK 
CROATIA IS WILLING TO TAKE ON, ARE RELATIVELY SMALL. 
ENVIRONMENTAL OPPOSITION TO THE PIPELINE HAS ARISEN, AND THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S WILLINGNESS TO MAKE MORE-THAN-BARE-MINIMUM 
INVESTMENTS IN THE PROJECT COULD WEAKEN IF IT DOES NOT 
RECEIVE CLEAR COMMITMENTS FROM SUPPLIERS AND BUYERS.  SIMILAR 
ISSUES SURROUND THE CPOT (CONSTANTA-PANCEVO-OMISALJ-TRIESTE) 
BOSPORUS BYPASS PIPELINE PROJECT, AS WELL AS CONCERN OVER THE 
LOSS OF SERBIAN AND BOSNIAN EXPORT MARKETS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) ON DECEMBER 16, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SIX 
COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE DRUZHBADRIA OIL PIPELINE PROJECT 
SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ON COOPERATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
PROJECT OF INTEGRATION OF THE \"DRUZHBA\" AND \"ADRIA\" OIL 
PIPELINES IN ZAGREB.  THE AGREEMENT WAS THE CULMINATION OF 
FIVE YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS, BUT IMPORTANT ISSUES REMAIN TO BE 
WORKED OUT BEFORE ANY OIL ACTUALLY FLOWS FROM RUSSIAN OIL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00799  01 OF 05  110814Z 
FIELDS, THROUGH UKRAINE, BELARUS, SLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY TO THE 
TERMINUS OF THE DRUZHBA PIPELINE, THEN INTO THE ADRIA 
PIPELINE TO THE CROATIAN PORT OF OMISALJ. 
 
3.  (U) CURRENTLY JANAF, THE CROATIAN STATE-OWNED OIL 
PIPELINE COMPANY, RECEIVES OIL AT THE DEEP-WATER PORT OF 
OMISALJ, ON THE NORTHERN CROATIAN ADRIATIC COAST, LESS THAN A 
HUNDRED MILES FROM TRIESTE.  SOME OIL GOES TO THE RIJEKA 
REFINERY, AND THE REST IS PUMPED VIA PIPELINE OVER THE GORSKI 
KOTAR MOUNTAINS TO A REFINERY IN SISAK (SOUTH OF ZAGREB), 
THEN EASTWARDS TOWARDS SERBIA AND NORTHWARD TOWARDS HUNGARY. 
 
4.  (U) IN ORDER FOR CROATIA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN TO 
CREATE A NEW ROUTE FOR THE EXPORT OF RUSSIAN CRUDE TO WESTERN 
EUROPE AND THE U.S., IT WILL NEED TO INSTALL PUMPS CAPABLE OF 
PUMPING OIL IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.  THE INITIAL INVESTMENT 
REQUIRED TO ENABLE JANAF TO ACCOMPLISH THE FIRST-PHASE GOAL 
OF BEING ABLE TO EXPORT FIVE MILLION TONS OF OIL A YEAR COULD 
BE AS LITTLE AS $20 MILLION.  INVESTMENTS OF UP TO $70 TO 80 
MILLION WOULD BE NEEDED TO REALIZE THE FINAL OUTPUT GOAL OF 
15 MILLION TONS PER YEAR.  MUCH OF THE NEW INVESTMENT IS FOR 
STRENGTHENING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES.

5.  (SBU) A RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENT IS NEEDED IN THE 
SHORT-TERM BECAUSE JANAF\'S FACILITIES ARE WOEFULLY 
UNDERUTILIZED.  KRESIMIR BARANOVIC, HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT 
PROJECTS FOR JANAF SAID MOST OF THE NEAR-TERM INVESTMENTS 
WILL BE FOR REVERSIBLE PUMPS AT THE SISAK REFINERY, SOME 
PUMPS AT OMISALJ FOR LOADING OIL ONTO TANKERS, ADDITIONAL 
STORAGE TANKS AT SISAK, AND SOME PIPING AND CONTROL 
EQUIPMENT.  MUCH OF THIS EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN BOUGHT AND SOME 
DELIVERED.  SOME EXISTING PUMPS ARE SIMPLY BEING REPOSITIONED. 
 
PIPELINE BRINGS EXISTING PROBLEMS INTO FOCUS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) SOON AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE DRUZHBADRIA AGREEMENT, 
THE MEDIA AND NGOS PROMINENTLY RAISED ENVIRONMENTAL 
QUESTIONS.  THE \"ENVIRONMENTALISTS\" BREAK DOWN INTO TWO 
GROUPS -- THOSE WHO SIMPLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
AND JANAF CONDUCT APPROPRIATE STUDIES AND TAKE THE ADEQUATE 
PRECAUTIONS, AND THOSE WHO THINK THAT ANY ADDITIONAL 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK TO THE CROATIAN COAST IS UNACCEPTABLE. 
CONCERNS CENTERED ON TWO ISSUES -- THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OIL 
SPILL AND THE EFFECT OF DISCHARGES OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF 
BALLAST WATERS, WHICH COULD INTRODUCE NEW AQUATIC INVASIVE 
SPECIES TO THE CROATIAN ADRIATIC COAST.  LOCALS AND OTHERS 
CITED CONCERNS THAT A LARGE SPILL COULD ENDANGER TOURISM, 
WHICH IS BY FAR CROATIA\'S BIGGEST FOREIGN CURRENCY EARNER, 
BRINGING IN AN ESTIMATED $4 BILLION IN REVENUE IN 2002. 
MEDIA REPORTS QUOTE THE PRESIDENT OF JANAF AS SAYING REVENUE 
FLOWS FROM THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT WOULD BE $30 MILLION PER 
YEAR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT, INCREASING TO $80 
MILLION AT FULL CAPACITY. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00799  02 OF 05  110814Z 
 
7.  (SBU) THE GOVERNMENT, SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFULLY, HAS REBUTTED 
THE OIL-SPILL ARGUMENT BY NOTING THAT THE INTENSITY OF 
TRAFFIC ENVISIONED UNDER THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT -- AT ITS 
PEAK, 80 LARGE (250 THOUSAND PLUS TON ) TANKERS PER YEAR -- 
WILL HARDLY CHANGE.  CURRENTLY, ABOUT 50-60 TANKERS A YEAR 
DOCK AT OMISALJ (IN THE PRE-WAR YEARS IT WAS OVER A HUNDRED), 
AND OVER 400 AT TRIESTE.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S ARGUMENT IS NOT 
THAT IT IS PERFECTLY SAFE -- AN IMPOSSIBLE ASSURANCE TO GIVE 
-- BUT THAT IT WOULD BE NO MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CURRENT 
SITUATION. 
 
8.  (SBU) THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH OTHER 
GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION TO UPGRADE REQUIREMENTS FOR TANKERS 
(E.G., TO REQUIRE THAT TANKERS BE DOUBLE HULLED) AND TO 
ESTABLISH TRAFFIC LANES IN THE ADRIATIC.  (CURRENTLY THERE 
ARE NO TRAFFIC LANES, ACCORDING TO THE MARITIME MINISTRY. 
WHEN WE QUIPPED \"THANK GOODNESS THERE ARE NO ICEBERGS IN THE 
ADRIATIC\" THE REJOINDER WAS \"AH, YES, BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF 
ISLANDS.\") 
 
9.  (SBU) CONTACTS AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND MARITIME

WHILE OFF-LOADING OR LOADING A SHIP, COULD BE EASILY 
CONTAINED BY JANAF\'S MODERN EQUIPMENT.  MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
WOULD BE A SPILL AT OPEN SEA.  IN THAT CASE, THEY CONCEDED, 
CROATIA\'S RESOURCES WOULD BE OVERWHELMED, AND THEY WOULD 
REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL HELP. 
 
BALLAST WATER PROBLEM 
--------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) THE BALLAST WATER PROBLEM IS NEW ONLY IN ITS SCOPE 
AND IN THE ATTENTION IT HAS DRAWN.  CURRENTLY, SHIPS THAT 
TAKE ON CROATIAN EXPORTS ARE DUMPING BALLAST WATER IN UNKNOWN 
LOCATIONS -- THERE ARE NO CONTROLS.  THE QUANTITIES ARE 
PROBABLY SMALL, AND MANY OF THESE SHIPS ARE MOVING BETWEEN 
MEDITERRANEAN PORTS, RATHER THAN BRINGING BALLAST WATERS FROM 
FARTHER AFIELD.  THUS, THE QUESTIONS RAISED OVER THE 
DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE ARE HIGHLIGHTING A PROBLEM THAT HAS 
EXISTED FOR QUITE A WHILE, IF IN LESS DRASTIC FORM.  IDEALLY, 
BALLAST WATERS SHOULD BE EXCHANGED 200 MILES FROM SHORE -- 
WHICH MEANS NOWHERE IN THE ADRIATIC -- AND THERE ARE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WISDOM OF DOING IT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. 
CROATIA IS LOOKING AT THIS PROBLEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION (IMO) AND AS PART OF THE 
ADRIATIC UNION INITIATIVE. 
 
11.  (SBU) IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR, JANAF FORMED AN EXPERT 
GROUP TO LOOK AT THE BALLAST WATER PROBLEM, INCLUDING MEMBERS 
FROM RESEARCH AND UNIVERSITY INSTITUTIONS, ACCORDING TO THE 
JANAF WEBSITE.  OUR GOVERNMENT CONTACTS TELL US THIS GROUP 
MET ONCE, THEN DECIDED THAT THE PROBLEM HAD TO BE ADDRESSED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT.  AN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE WAS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00799  03 OF 05  110815Z 
FORMED, BUT APPARENTLY HAS YET TO MEET. 
 
12.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENT CONTACTS, JANAF 
TECHNICALLY DOES NOT NEED TO DO AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY 
(EIS) FOR THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE, SINCE THE EXISTING 
PIPELINE AND ON- AND OFF-LOADING FACILITIES AT OMISALJ ARE 
ALREADY LICENSED FOR TRANSPORTING UP TO 30 MILLION TONS A 
YEAR.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE PIPELINE, 
THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTED JANAF TO DO AN EIS, AT JANAF\'S 
EXPENSE.  THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT BELIEVES THIS WILL TAKE 
ONLY TWO TO THREE MONTHS, PLUS ANOTHER FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS 
FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.  (NOTE: PER THE SCOPE OF WORK OF A 
TDA-FINANCED FEASIBILITY STUDY OF THE CPOT PROJECT -- SEE 
PARA 16 BELOW -- THERE WILL BE AT LEAST A PARTIAL EIS DONE AS 
PART OF THAT STUDY.  WE ARE TRYING TO CLARIFY THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO STUDIES.) 
 
CROATIA WANTS TO SEE THE MONEY

DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT, AND THE FACT THAT THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTMENT NECESSARY IS GOING FORWARD, IT IS STILL NOT A DONE

DEAL.  ASSISTANT MINISTER OF ECONOMY ROMAN NOTA RECENTLY 
COMMENTED TO US, HALF SARCASTICALLY, THAT AMERICANS AND 
RUSSIANS REGULARLY VISIT HIM TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE STATUS OF 
THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE PROJECT.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT 
SHOWING SUPPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR ROUTE, AND THEY ARE NOT 
COMMITTING TO PUT MONEY INTO THE PROJECT.  \"IT IS NOT CLEAR 
WHO WILL FILL THE PIPELINE, AND WHO WILL BUY WHAT COMES OUT.\" 
 INDEED, THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE GUARANTEES FOR 
MINIMUM DELIVERIES. 
 
14.  (SBU) A FEW U.S. COMPANIES HAVE EXPRESSED PRELIMINARY 
INTEREST IN SOURCING FROM THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE, BUT WERE 
DIRECTED BY THE GOC AND JANAF TO AK TRANSNEFT -- THE RUSSIAN 
ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING SUPPLIES AND BUYERS FOR THE 
OIL -- TO NEGOTIATE ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  THE GOC AND 
JANAF ARE ALSO NOT INTERESTED IN ANY DEAL THAT WOULD RESULT 
IN LOSING OWNERSHIP CONTROL OF ITS PIPELINE, WHICH WAS PART 
OF THE OFFER OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE INTERESTED U.S. PARTIES. 
 
15.  (SBU) IN THE MEANTIME, THERE ARE RISKS FOR CROATIA -- 
NAMELY ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, AND BY EXTENSION, POLITICAL 
RISKS.  FOR CROATIA, UPGRADING ITS ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING 
AND POLLUTION CONTROLS WILL BE RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE.  NOTA 
CHARACTERIZED COOPERATION AMONG THE COUNTRIES PARTY TO THE 
AGREEMENT AS GOOD, WITH \"OCCASIONAL PROBLEMS FROM UKRAINE,\" 
WHICH HAS A POTENTIALLY COMPETING, \"INTERNAL PROJECT,\" I.E., 
ODESSA-BRODY.  WHILE NOTA HAS SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT THE CPOT 
PROJECT, IF BOTH PROJECTS WERE RUNNING CONCURRENTLY, CROATIA 
WOULD GET MORE BENEFIT WITH THE SAME RISK, HE SAID.

16.  (SBU) THE CONSTANTA-PANCEVO-OMISALJ-TRIESTE (CPOT) 
PIPELINE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING CASPIAN BASIN OIL FIRST 
TO AN EXPORT TERMINAL AT OMISALJ, THEN AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION 
OF A PIPELINE TO TRIESTE, TO THE TRANS-ALPINE PIPELINE.  A 
U.S. CONSORTIUM, HLP-PARSONS, IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A 
TDA-FINANCED TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY STUDY.  THE 
RELATIVELY MINOR UPGRADES THAT CROATIA WOULD HAVE TO MAKE FOR 
THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT WOULD COMPLEMENT THE POTENTIALLY 
LARGER CPOT PROJECT.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS FOR 
CROATIA REGARDING THE CPOT PROJECT.  CURRENTLY, SERBIA AND 
PARTS OF BOSNIA ARE SERVED BY OIL COMING EAST FROM OMISALJ 
AND SISAK, EITHER THROUGH PIPELINE OR TRUCK.  SHOULD A CPOT 
PIPELINE BE BUILT, CROATIA WOULD LOSE THOSE MARKETS, AS THE 
PETROLEUM WOULD FLOW WEST AND SUPPLY REFINERIES IN SERBIA AND 
BOSNIA. 
 
17.  (SBU) IN A MEETING WITH JANAF PRESIDENT VESNA 
TRNOKOP-TANTA AND AN ADVISOR, PROBLEMS WERE CITED WITH THE 
PARSONS STUDY.  NAMELY, JANAF FELT THAT PARSONS WAS USING 
UNREALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE 
RESULTANT USE OF ENERGY IN SERBIA AND BOSNIA.  THESE

ASSUMPTIONS INCREASED THE COST OF THE PROJECT IN TWO WAYS -- 
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD NEED TO BE BUILT IN THE EASTERN 
PART OF THE ROUTE, AND LESS OIL WOULD END UP BEING DELIVERED 
TO CROATIA AS A RESULT OF CONSUMPTION PROJECTIONS.  \"IT ISN\'T 
WORTH IT TO US TO LOSE OUR SERBIAN MARKETS, IF WE ONLY GET 5 
MILLION TONS OF OIL,\" COMPLAINED TRNOKOP.  (IN OTHER QUARTERS 
WE HAVE HEARD ESTIMATES OF 10-12 MILLION TONS PER YEAR AS THE 
MINIMUM ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE AMOUNT.)  ON THE OTHER HAND, 
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY OFFICIALS SAID THEIR DISPLEASURE WITH THE 
PARSONS STUDY WAS SIMPLY THAT PARSONS WAS USING OLD, 
INACCURATE DATA. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
18.  (SBU) WHILE BOTH PIPELINE PROJECTS COULD BE BENEFICIAL 
TO CROATIA, THERE IS LITTLE CROATIA CAN DO, AS A TRANSIT 
COUNTRY, TO BRING THE PROJECTS TO FRUITION.  IN THE MEANTIME, 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS ARE INCREASING, AND JANAF WILL BE 
LOATH TO COMPLETE EXTENSIVE INVESTMENTS , INCLUDING IN 
ENVIRONMENTAL UPGRADES, UNTIL THE PROJECTS HAVE FIRM SUPPORT 
FROM BUYERS AND SUPPLIERS.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) THE UNOFFICIAL STARTING GUN FOR THE NEXT 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION HAS GONE OFF, BUT PM RACAN\'S 
COALITION-LEADING SDP IS STALLED AT THE START.  A NEW 
USAID-SPONSORED IRI POLL SHOWS THAT ONLY 13 PERCENT OF VOTERS 
NOW PLAN TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR THE SDP.  VOTER 
DISSATISFACTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS AT 68 PERCENT, 
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LEVEL IT WAS WITH THE LAST GOVERNMENT IN 
1999 AFTER A DECADE OF WAR AND HDZ MISRULE HAD BROUGHT 
CROATIA TO ECONOMIC RUIN AND INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  THE 
SDP\'S FOUR SMALLER COALITION PARTNERS HAVE BEGUN TO PREPARE 
THEMSELVES FOR THE ELECTION, AND OPPOSITION PARTIES ALREADY 
HAVE THEIR CAMPAIGN BILLBOARDS OUT.  THE SDP, HOWEVER, IS IN 
DISARRAY, AND RACAN FACES DISSENT WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY FROM 
BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT. 
 
2.  (C) IRI POLLSTERS SAY THAT IF THE SDP CAN TURN THINGS 
AROUND, A COALITION WHICH EXCLUDES THE STILL-UNRECONSTRUCTED 
HDZ CAN WIN IN ELECTIONS THIS AUTUMN.  THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY AND CROATIAN VOTERS ARE RIGHT TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY 
THE OPPORTUNITIES MISSED BY THE RACAN GOVERNMENT, BUT THERE 
HAVE BEEN SOME IMPORTANT POSITIVE CHANGES.  FOR ALL THEIR 
PERSONAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL FAILINGS, THE PARTIES WHICH MAKE 
UP THIS GOVERNMENT ARE IN THE EUROPEAN MAINSTREAM.  ON ISSUES 
OF MOST CONCERN TO US BUT (REGRETABLY) NOT TO THE TYPICAL 
CROATIAN VOTER, THEIR PERFORMANCE IS VARIED: LITTLE PROGRESS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00803  01 OF 04  111156Z 
OR COMMITMENT ON REFUGEE RETURNS, UNEVEN COOPERATION WITH 
ICTY, AND GOOD NEIGHBORLY RELATIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT.  THESE 
LEVELS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED UNDER AN HDZ GOVERNMENT 
BECAUSE ITS MANY OF ITS LEADING FIGURES AND CONSTITUENTS ARE 
FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO BUILDING AN OPEN, INCLUSIVE CROATIA. 
 
3.  (C) AS MUCH AS WE REGRET RACAN\'S LACK OF LEADERSHIP, 
THERE IS AS YET NO ALTERNATIVE TO A COALITION INCLUDING THE 
SDP THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FUNDAMENTALLY UNDEMOCRATIC HDZ. 
 UNLESS THE SDP CAN GET BACK ON ITS FEET, SUCH A COALITION 
MAY NOT PREVAIL AT THE POLLS IN OCTOBER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
IRI POLL SERVES AS ELECTION STARTING GUN 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) CROATIA\'S NEXT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION MUST TAKE PLACE 
BEFORE APRIL 2004, BUT THE COALITION HAS ALL BUT FORMALLY 
ANNOUNCED ELECTIONS FOR OCTOBER 2003.  THE THREE LARGEST 
PARTIES OF THE FIVE-PARTY COALITION WHICH MAKE UP THE 
COALITION LED BY PM RACAN\'S SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP) 
HAVE ALL ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL NOT JOIN A PRE-ELECTION 
COALITION.  A USAID-SPONSORED IRI POLL COMPLETED ON MARCH 25 
SHOWS THAT THE SDP STILL LEADS THE COALITION, BUT HAS THE 
SUPPORT OF ONLY 13 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS WHO SAID THEY WOULD 
TAKE PART IN ELECTIONS, DOWN FROM 23 PERCENT IN JUNE 2001, 
BELOW THE OPPOSITION HDZ (22 PERCENT) AND FAR BEHIND THOSE 
WHO SAID THEY WOULD VOTE BUT HAVE NOT MADE UP THEIR MINDS (29 
PERCENT). 
 
VOTER DISSATISFACTION NEAR ALL-TIME HIGH 
---------------------------------------- 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00803  01 OF 04  111156Z 
 
5.  (C) ONE OF THE MOST STARTLING RESULTS FROM THE IRI POLL 
(CONDUCTED BY PULS, CROATIA\'S LEADING PUBLIC-OPINION FIRM) IS 
THAT ONLY 22 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS THINK THAT CROATIA IS 
HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, DOWN FROM A PEAK OF 57 
PERCENT AFTER THE COALITION TOOK OFFICE IN JANUARY 2000. 
FULLY 68 PERCENT SAID THAT CROATIA IS BEING LED IN THE WRONG 
DIRECTION, VERY CLOSE TO THE LEVEL OF VOTER DISSATISFACTION 
IN 1999, AFTER NEARLY A DECADE OF WAR AND HDZ MISRULE.  THE 
POLL SHOWS THAT 73 PERCENT OF CROATIANS BELIEVE THAT THE SDP 
IS MOST RESPONSIBLE IN THE COALITION FOR GOC POLICY.  THREE 
TIMES AS MANY RESPONDENTS BELIEVE THE SDP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
SQUABBLES IN THE COALITION THAN THE SDP, AND 55 PERCENT 
EITHER THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT HAD DONE NOTHING GOOD DURING 
ITS TENURE OR COULD NOT POINT TO A SINGLE POSITIVE 
ACCOMPLISHMENT. 
 
IRI:  COALITION \"SURVIVABLE\" 
---------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) NEVERTHELESS, IRI POLLSTERS SAID THE COALITION IN ITS 
CURRENT FORM IS \"SURVIVABLE,\" PROVIDED THE SDP COULD GET ITS 
RATING UP TO 20 PERCENT.  THEY LAID OUT A STRATEGY -- WHICH 
THEY LATER PITCHED TO ALL COALITION PARTIES -- WHERE THE 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

GOVERNMENT SHOULD FIRST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT LIVING UP 
TO VOTER EXPECTATIONS AND THEN GET THE MESSAGE OUT ON THINGS 
THEY HAVE DONE, ESPECIALLY ON JOB CREATION AND IN BRINGING 
CROATIA\'S TOURIST INDUSTRY BACK TO LIFE. 
 
SDP GETS THE BAD NEWS 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (C) WE MET WITH SDP SECRETARY GENERAL IGOR DRAGOVAN, WHO 
ATTENDED IRI\'S PRESENTATION OF THE POLL RESULTS TO HIS PARTY. 
 PM RACAN (PRESIDENT OF THE SDP) WAS NOT AVAILABLE, BUT KEY 
SENIOR LEADERS WERE PRESENT, INCLUDING DEPUTY PM/DEFENSE 
MINISTER ANTUNOVIC, LABOR MINISTER VIDOVIC AND INTERIOR 
MINISTER LUCIN.  AFTER A BRIEF GRIPE ABOUT A LEAK TO THE 
PRESS BY ANOTHER PARTY OF THE POLL\'S UNFAVORABLE SHOWING OF 
THE SDP, DRAGOVAN EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO BE ABLE TO SHAPE HIS PARTY\'S MESSAGE IN TIME TO GET 
RESULTS. 
 
8.  (C) DRAGOVAN WAS DISCOURAGED, BUT NOT SURPRISED, BY THE 
FACT THAT VOTERS DON\'T KNOW ANY OF THE COALITION\'S 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  DRAGOVAN AGREED WITH IRI\'S CRITICISM THAT 
PM RACAN\'S INABILITY TO TAKE CREDIT FOR PROGRESS ON THE 
ECONOMY IS COMPOUNDED BY HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO DEVELOP A 
PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATIONS STAFF.  THE ONE POLL RESULT THAT 
CAUGHT HIM BY SURPRISE WAS THAT VOTERS BELIEVE THE SDP IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE SQUABBLES BETWEEN COALITION 
PARTNERS.  DRAGOVAN INSISTED THAT THE CROATIAN PEASANT\'S 
PARTY (HSS) HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST ALL OF THE 
CONFLICTS. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

RACAN WANTS TO RUN ON HIS RECORD 
-------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) DESPITE THE SDP\'S CURRENT STANDING, DRAGOVAN IS 
OPTIMISTIC AND CLAIMS THE SDP HAS A PLAN TO GET OUT THE WORD. 
 HE GAVE US A COPY OF A BOOKLET THE SDP IS ISSUING TO ALL 
PARTY MEMBERS TO GIVE THEM CONCRETE FACTS TO REFUTE 
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE COALITION\'S INACTION.  THE LIST OF 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS IMPRESSIVE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED WITH 
THE PRECEDING HDZ GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE.  THERE ARE \"TALKING 
POINTS\" FOR SDP RANK-AND-FILE ON ALL SUBJECT AREAS, BUT 
DRAGOVAN BELIEVES THE BOOKLET\'S FRAMING OF THE GOC\'S TRACK 
RECORD ON THE ECONOMY WILL BE MOST CONVINCING.  STATISTICS 
CITED IN THE SDP\'S \"WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED\" BOOKLET 
INCLUDE: 
 
- STEADY, IMPRESSIVE GROWTH IN GDP, FROM -0.4 PERCENT IN 1999 
TO 5.2 PERCENT IN 2002; 
- PER CAPITA GDP IS NOW 5,150 EURO, AHEAD OF NINE EU 
CANDIDATE COUNTRIES; 
- INFLATION DOWN STEADILY: 
- RETIREMENT OF MOST OF THE HDZ-ERA DEBT; 
- 3.2 BILLION DOLLARS IN FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT: 
- REDUCTION OF THE STATE BUDGET OUTLAYS; 
- REDUCTION OF INTEREST RATES FOR CONSUMER CREDIT; 
- IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES; 
- INCREASING THE REAL WAGES OF THE AVERAGE WORKER; AND 
- REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS. 
 
10.  (C) DRAGOVAN TOLD US THAT THE SDP\'S WAR CHEST IS FULL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00803  02 OF 04  111156Z 
AND THEY PLAN TO ROLL OUT ADS THIS SUMMER TAKING CREDIT FOR 
THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  HE WAS FRUSTRATED THAT THE SDP\'S 
SMALLER COALITION PARTNER HNS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH 
PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETING THE ZAGREB-SPLIT HIGHWAY, WHICH 
VOTERS CITE AS ONE OF THE FEW ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS GOVERNMENT 
(EVEN THOUGH THE HIGHWAY WILL NOT BE COMPLETED BEFORE 
ELECTIONS). 
 
DISSENT WITHIN THE SDP 
---------------------- 
 
11.  (C) IN ADDITION TO THE PROBLEM OF GETTING HIS MESSAGE 
OUT, RACAN FACES OPEN DISSENT FROM WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY\'S 
RANKS.  ON APRIL 2, SDP MP ZLATKO SESELJ QUIT THE PARLIAMENT, 
RETURNING HIS MANDATE TO THE SDP.  SESELJ TOLD THE PRESS THAT 
HE IS FED UP THAT HIS PARTY HAS CONSISTENTLY BACKED DOWN IN 
THE FACE OF PRESSURE FROM THE HSS.  THE LAST STRAW IN 
SESELJ\'S CASE WAS THE SDP AGREEING TO APPROVE THE HSS 
EDUCATION MINISTER\'S PROPOSED HIGH SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS WHICH, 
ACCORDING TO SESELJ \"ARE NOT WORTH THE PAPER THEY\'RE PRINTED 
ON.\"  SESELJ, A CAREER EDUCATOR AND OWNER OF A PRIVATE HIGH 
SCHOOL IN ZAGREB, SAID THAT THE HSS TEXTBOOK \"PASSED BECAUSE 
OF HSS PRESIDENT TOMCIC\'S \"BLACKMAIL.\"

12.  (C) ZDRAVKO TOMAC, CHAIR OF THE PARLIAMENT\'S FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, IS ACTIVELY SUBVERTING SOME OF HIS PARTY\'S 
TACTICS ON ELECTIONS.  DRAGOVAN TOLD US THAT RACAN HAS BEEN 
TRYING TO EASE TOMAC OUT THE DOOR FOR YEARS, BUT THE JOWLY, 
CANTANKEROUS PROFESSOR JUST WON\'T GO.  FORMERLY A PARTY VICE 
PRESIDENT, TOMAC IS NO LONGER EVEN A MEMBER OF THE SDP 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  DRAGOVAN TOLD US THAT RACAN TRIED TO GET 
THE MESSAGE ACROSS BY FIRING TOMAC\'S SISTER FROM A COMFY SPOT 
AS ASSISTANT MINISTER OF VETERANS\' AFFAIRS, BUT TOMAC HANGS 
ON, USING HIS COMMITTEE CHAIR AS A PULPIT FOR HIS OWN PET 
POLICY: INSISTING THAT THE DAYTON AGREEMENT BE REVISED TO 
CREATE A SEPARATE ENTITY FOR ETHNIC CROATS IN BIH.  (NOTE: 
EACH TIME TOMAC MAKES SUCH AN ANNOUNCEMENT, GOC AND SDP 
OFFICIALS MAKE STATEMENTS DECLARING THAT TOMAC DOES NOT SPEAK 
FOR EITHER THE PARTY OR THE GOVERNMENT.) 
 
13.  (C) WE AND MANY IN THE MEDIA THOUGHT TOMAC HAD FINALLY 
CROSSED THE LINE WHEN AS A GUEST AT THE ANNUAL CONVENTION OF 
THE MODERATE OPPOSITION PARTY DEMOCRATIC CENTER (DC), HE WAS 
QUOTED AS SAYING HE WOULD SUPPORT DC PRESIDENT MATE GRANIC AS 
A CANDIDATE FOR PRIME MINISTER.  HOWEVER, RACAN\'S ONLY 
RESPONSE WAS TO REMARK THAT \"TOMAC SEEMS TO BE DISTANCING 
HIMSELF FROM THE SDP.\"   DRAGOVAN TOLD US THAT RACAN SEEKS TO 
AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF DISSENT WITHIN THE PARTY AND DOES NOT 
WANT TO ALIENATE THE MORE CONSERVATIVE SDP VOTERS WHO 
ASSOCIATE WITH TOMAC. 
 
ELECTION-YEAR LEGISLATION? 
-------------------------- 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00803  03 OF 04  111156Z 
14.  (C) ALTHOUGH IT IS LATE IN THE LEGISLATIVE SEASON FOR 
NEW INITIATIVES, THE SDP IS TRYING TO GET THROUGH TWO MORE 
\"REFORMS\" WHICH THEY HOPE WILL BE POPULAR WITH VOTERS.  ONE 
IS AN ELECTION-YEAR TAX REFORM, ANNOUNCED IN GENERAL TERMS ON 
APRIL 7.  THE SDP PROPOSES BROAD CUTS TO INCOME TAXES AND TO 
OFFSET THE LOSS WITH INCREASES IN PROPERTY TAXES.  THE OTHER 
IS REFORM OF THE LABOR CODE, BUT THE SDP EFFORT SEEMS TO HAVE 
RUN OUT OF STEAM.  FOLLOWING A LONG STALEMATE, GOVERNMENT, 
EMPLOYER, AND LABOR UNION NEGOTIATORS APPEARED TO BE ON TRACK 
TO REACHING A COMPROMISE ON A NEW LABOR LAW.  BUT ON APRIL 9, 
LABOR LEADERS WALKED OUT OF NEGOTIATIONS, INSISTING THAT THE 
GOC WAS NOT NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH.  ONE OBSERVER NOTED 
THAT THE TIMING OF THE WALKOUT IS PREDICTABLE: UNIONS JUST 
WANT TO GET THE BEST DEAL THEY CAN BEFORE THEIR TRADITIONAL 
PROTEST ON MAY 1; IF THEY HELP BRING DOWN THE SDP, THEY ARE 
UNLIKELY TO GET A BETTER DEAL FROM THE HDZ. 
 
ELECTION LAW GAMBLE WOULD RELY ON AGREEMENT WITH BIH 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
15.  (C) ON APRIL 3, THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT PASSED TECHNICAL 
CHANGES TO EXISTING ELECTION LAW WHEN COALITION PARTNERS 
COULD NOT COME TO COMPROMISE ON A NEW ELECTORAL MODEL.  THE 
SABOR BROUGHT THE OLD LAW INTO LINE WITH THE NEW 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES AND MADE SOME OTHER 
IMPORTANT TECHNICAL CHANGES, BUT DID NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF 
DIASPORA VOTING.  ALL CROATIAN CITIZENS, REGARDLESS OF WHERE 
THEY RESIDE, STILL HAVE A RIGHT UNDER CROATIA\'S CONSTITUTION, 
TO VOTE IN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  IN THE LAST ELECTION, 
HARD-LINE NATIONALIST CROATS FROM BOSNIA USED THIS TO ELECT 
SIX MP\'S ON THE HDZ SLATE.

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00803  03 OF 04  111156Z 
 
16.  (C) THE GOC IS COUNTING ON SIGNING A NEW BILATERAL 
AGREEMENT ON DUAL CITIZENSHIP WITH BIH WHICH WOULD PREVENT 
CROATS WHO VOTED IN BOSNIA FROM VOTING IN CROATIA.  WHILE THE 
MFA INFORMS US THAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE WELL ALONG, OTHER 
OBSERVERS WARN US THAT THIS AGREEMENT COULD BE AT RISK IF BIH 
DECIDES TO PLAY HARDBALL AND LINK THE DUAL CITIZENSHIP 
AGREEMENT TO PROGRESS ON OTHER ISSUES.  ONE SUCH ISSUE OF 
GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BIH IS THE LONG-PENDING AGREEMENT ON THE 
STATUS OF THE PORT OF PLOCE.  BIH IS TO GAIN SPECIAL ACCESS 
TO THE PORT IN EXCHANGE FOR FREE PASSAGE FOR TRAVELLERS 
THROUGH THE NEUM CORRIDOR (A STRETCH OF THE ADRIATIC COAST, 
PART OF BIH, WHICH SEPARATES CROATIA\'S MAINLAND FROM THE 
DUBROVNIK REGION).  THE PARLIAMENT\'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
COMMITTEE -- AT THE URGING OF NONE OTHER THAN ZDRAVKO TOMAC 
-- IS OPPOSING A GOC COMPROMISE ON AN AGREEMENT WITH BIH 
REGARDING THE STATUS OF THE PORT OF PLOCE.

A GOVERNMENT ON ITS OWN AND NO COALITION WHICH DOES NOT

18.  (C) LIKE THE RESPONDENTS TO THE IRI POLL, WE HAVE BEEN 
DISAPPOINTED BY THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S MISSED OPPORTUNITIES 
AND BY HIS INDECISIVE LEADERSHIP STYLE, BUT AN HDZ GOVERNMENT 
WOULD BE WORSE.  DESPITE ITS NEW FACADE, AND WHILE IT MIGHT 
MAKE THE TRAINS RUN ON TIME, THE HDZ REMAINS THE PARTY OF 
EXCLUSIONARY ETHNIC NATIONALISTS.  THEY WOULD OBSTRUCT THE 
PROCESS OF ADDRESSING THE LEGACY OF ETHNIC WAR.  AT SOME 
POINT IN THE FUTURE -- BUT CERTAINLY NOT IN TIME FOR THIS 
FALL\'S ELECTIONS -- THE HDZ MAY CHANGE ENOUGH AT THE 
FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL TO BE A USEFUL PARTNER FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  AFTER ALL, FEW WHO SAW GEORGE 
WALLACE IN 1963 COULD HAVE PREDICTED HE WOULD RENOUNCE HIS 
SEGREGATIONIST VIEWS AND FIND SUPPORT 20 YEARS LATER AMONG 
MORE PROGRESSIVE VOTERS.  FOR NOW, THE PARTIES WHICH MAKE UP 
THE CURRENT COALITION ARE MORE LIKELY TO MOVE FORWARD ON 
POLICIES WHICH ADVANCE OUR GOALS FOR REGIONAL STABILITY, EVEN 
IF THEY DO SO ONLY WHEN PRESSURED AND EVEN THEN ONLY 
GRUDGINGLY. 
 
19.  (C) OUR USAID DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN 
RAMPED UP IN THIS ELECTION YEAR TO HELP THE SDP AND ALL OTHER 
REFORM-ORIENTED POLITICAL PARTIES IN CROATIA.  IN ADDITION TO 
PROFESSIONAL POLLING INFORMATION, WE ARE TRAINING PARTY 
LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS, ORGANIZING FOCUS GROUPS, AND HELPING 
PARTIES DEFINE HOW BEST TO TAILOR THEIR MESSAGES TO ACHIEVE

SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: GOC STATEMENT ON THE FALL OF IRAQI REGIME 
 
 
1.  ON APRIL 11, THE GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA ISSUED A 
STATEMENT COMMENTING ON THE FALL OF BAGHDAD AND THE 
COLLAPSE OF THE IRAQI REGIME.  THE STATEMENT (FULL TEXT 
    BELOW) HAILS THE END OF THE REGIME AS A CHANCE FOR THE 
FUTURE OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, AS WELL AS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT 
OF PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE REGION.  THE STATEMENT ALSO 
REITERATES CROATIA\'S WILLINGNESS TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
RECONSTRUCTION AND CALLS FOR A UN ROLE IN ASSURING HUMAN 
RIGHTS PROTECTION IN POST-CONFLICT IRAQ. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT OF GOC STATEMENT: 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ASSESSES THE FALL 
OF SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S DICTATORSHIP REGIME AS A GOOD CHANCE 
FOR THE FUTURE OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, AS WELL AS FOR THE 
ADVANCEMENT OF PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE WIDER REGION. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA HOPES THAT 
MILITARY OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE SUFFERING OF IRAQI 
CITIZENS, ALLIANCE SOLDIERS, JOURNALISTS, AND OTHER 
VICTIMS, WILL SOON BE OVER. 
 
IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES IN IRAQ, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
PUBLIC PEACE AND ORDER, THE TRUE PROTECTION OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS, AND THE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN 
WHICH THE UN SHOULD HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE, IS OF CRUCIAL 
IMPORTANCE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 
EXPECTS IRAQ TO BE CONSTITUTED AS A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY WITH 
THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH WILL ENABLE A PEACEFUL AND DIGNIFIED 
LIFE TO ALL ITS CITIZENS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA PASSED A DECISION 
ON APRIL 3, 2002 ON SENDING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO 
IRAQ\'S WAR-AFFECTED POPULATION IN THE AMOUNT OF 20 MILLION 
KUNA, AND ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT ITS SPEEDY DELIVERY AND 
    DISTRIBUTION ARE CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED. THE GOVERNMENT 
REITERATES THE WILLINGNESS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA TO 
PARTICIPATE IN REMOVING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR AND IN 
THE ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ.

CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF MITCH BENEDICT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE GOC INITIATED A COMMENT AND DISCUSSION 
PERIOD FOR A DRAFT NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR ROMA IN MARCH, AND 
WOULD LIKE TO FINALIZE THE PLAN BY THE FALL.  NGOS TELL US 
THE DRAFT PLAN IS A WELCOME EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE SEVERE 
OBSTACLES FACED BY THE ROMA IN CROATIA, BUT FALLS SHORT ON 
THE DETAILS AND FUNDING.  PRONE TO RELY ON EXPRESSIONS OF

SUCH AS ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL STRATEGY, IT REMAINS TO BE 
SEEN IF THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTIONS TO 
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ROMA IN CROATIA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) ANTE SIMONIC, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, ASSEMBLED A 
WORKING GROUP LATE LAST YEAR TO DRAFT A NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR 
ROMA.  THE GOC OFFICE FOR NATIONAL MINORITIES IS PLAYING A 
COORDINATING ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL 
STRATEGY, AND HAS RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM OSCE/OHIDR AND THE 
COUNCIL OF EUROPE.  ON MARCH 12 THE GOVERNMENT HELD A PUBLIC 
ROUNDTABLE TO PRESENT THE DRAFT NATIONAL STRATEGY, AND 
SIMONIC ANNOUNCED THERE WOULD BE A PERIOD OF PUBLIC 
DISCUSSION AND COMMENT BEFORE A FINAL REPORT WOULD BE 
PRESENTED TO THE GOVERNMENT.  ONCE THE GOVERNMENT APPROVES 
THE REPORT IT WILL BE PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT FOR ADOPTION. 
MLENA KLAJNER, ACTING HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICE FOR 
NATIONAL MINORITIES, TOLD US THE NATIONAL STRATEGY IS NOT 
LIKELY TO BE ADOPTED BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. 
 
3. (U) THE DRAFT NATIONAL STRATEGY CONTAINS A LONG LIST OF 
LARGELY GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED ACTIVITIES IN EDUCATION, 
GOVERNANCE, SOCIAL WELFARE, EMPLOYMENT, INTERNAL AFFAIRS, 
CULTURE, AND HOUSING.  THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES CONSIST OF 
LONG-TERM, MEDIUM-TERM, AND SHORT-TERM TASKS THAT ARE TO BE 
UNDERTAKEN BY GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES AND INSTITUTIONS, NGOS, 
AND THE ROMA COMMUNITY.  ROMA REPRESENTATIVES ARE TO BE 
SYSTEMATICALLY INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN 
THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, AND THROUGH 
THE COMMITTEE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL PROGRAM 
FOR ROMA.  THE COMMITTEE, TO CONSIST OF NINE REPRESENTATIVES 
OF RELEVANT MINISTRIES AND GOVERNMENT OFFICES, SEVEN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00836  01 OF 02  151548Z 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM ROMA COUNCILS, AND ONE REPRESENTATIVE 
FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS NGO, WILL MEET \"AS NECESSARY\" TO MONITOR 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY. 
 
4. (C) THE CROATIA HELSINKI COMMITTEE (HHO), THE MOST ACTIVE 
HUMAN RIGHTS NGO IN CROATIA WORKING ON ROMA ISSUES, TOLD US 
THAT WHILE THE GOVERNMENT IS WELL-INTENTIONED THE NATIONAL 
STRATEGY IS REALLY ADDRESSING \"LUXURY ITEMS\" RATHER THAN 
BASIC NEEDS, AND IS BETTER SUITED TO A DEVELOPED COUNTRY 
RATHER THAN CROATIA.  HHO FURTHER FAULTED THE GOC FOR NOT 
TAKING A HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH TO THE DOCUMENT, AND FOR NOT 
INCLUDING ANYONE FROM OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT IN THE INITIAL 
DRAFTING.  ON THE OTHER HAND, HHO PRAISED THE GOC FOR THE 
EFFORT, CITING IT AS THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS 
PROBLEMS FACING THE ROMA POPULATION IN CROATIA.  HHO WILL 
CLOSELY MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY. 
\"CHILDREN FIRST,\" A LOCAL NGO WITH LONG EXPERIENCE IN WORKING 
WITH THE ROMA, REJECTED WHAT IT TERMED THE \"GHETTOIZATION\" 
INHERENT IN SEPARATE SOLUTIONS FOR THE ROMA PROPOSED IN THE 
NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR PROBLEMS FACED BY ALL THOSE IN POVERTY. 
 WHILE WELCOME, PROPOSED EFFORTS TO EXPAND EARLY CHILDHOOD 
EDUCATION WERE CRITICIZED AS NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH. 
 
5. (C) ROMA NGOS SUCCESSFULLY HELD A FIRST CONGRESS OF ROMA 
IN CROATIA IN FEBRUARY 2003 AND UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED THE 
NATIONAL STRATEGY.  HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO HHO, ROMA VIEW THE 
NATIONAL STRATEGY AS \"TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.\"  AS A 
DISEMPOWERED COMMUNITY, ROMA SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT IS A 
GIVEN.  UNFORTUNATELY, ROMA NGOS ARE FRACTIOUS AND NUMEROUS 
-- CERTAINLY IN COMPARISON TO THEIR SMALL NUMBER, PERHAPS 
30-40,000 IN THE CROATIAN POPULATION AS A WHOLE -- AND HAVE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00836  01 OF 02  151548Z 
DIFFICULTY IN WORKING TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF COMMON GOALS. 
NON-ROMA NGOS THAT ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON ROMA ISSUES ARE 
UNANIMOUS IN THEIR VIEW THAT THE ROMA ARE INCAPABLE OF 
EFFECTIVELY WORKING ON THEIR OWN BEHALF.  BOJAN MUNJIN, WHO 
FOLLOWS ROMA ISSUES FOR THE HHO, SAID THE ROMA WERE A \"SAD 
AND DEPRESSED COMMUNITY\" WHO ARE SO POORLY EDUCATED THAT THEY 
HAVEN\'T \"THE TOOLS OR IMPLEMENTS\" TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS. 
KLAJNER TOLD US THERE ARE OVER 50 ROMA NGOS, AND THAT A 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN TO THOSE NGOS ENDS UP IN 
PRIVATE POCKETS, AN ASSESSMENT SHARED BY MANY IN THE DONOR 
COMMUNITY.  SHE SAID IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR DIFFERENT 
BROTHERS IN THE SAME FAMILY TO HEAD UP SEPARATE AND COMPETING 
NGOS. 
 
6. (C) BLANKA SHEGOVIC, DIRECTOR OF \"CHILDREN FIRST,\" HAS 
WORKED WITH THE ROMA COMMUNITY FOR AT LEAST SEVEN YEARS, 
ESTABLISHING PLAY GROUPS AND PRE-SCHOOL PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO 
HELP ROMA CHILDREN STAY IN SCHOOL.  SHE TOLD US THAT FEW ROMA 
NGOS ARE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ROMA 
COMMUNITY, BUT RATHER EXIST AS A MEANS FOR THE LEADER TO 
ESTABLISH A POWER BASE SECURED BY FUNDING PROVIDED BY DONORS. 
 MANY ROMA DO NOT WANT NON-ROMA NGOS INVOLVED IN ROMA ISSUES.

USUALLY NOT ADDRESSED.  THE ROMA STRATEGY INCLUDES SOME

ACTIVITIES IN 2003 ALONE, BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION WHERE 
THAT MONEY WILL COME FROM, OR IF THE GOC WILL BE ABLE TO 
ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR ACTIVITIES THIS YEAR.  NATIONAL

1. (SBU) REFUGEE RETURNS, RECONSTRUCTION, AND ETHNIC 
RELATIONS DOMINATED A RECENT VISIT TO DONJI LAPAC, A 
MUNICIPALITY OF 3,400 NEAR CROATIA\'S WESTERN BORDER WITH 
BOSNIA.  SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE WAR, BOTH IN TERMS OF 
DISPLACEMENT OF THE POPULATION AND DESTRUCTION OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE, THE MUNICIPALITY IS BEGINNING TO SHOW SOME 
SIGNS OF RENEWAL.  THE CHALLENGE WILL BE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO 
MAINTAIN REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 
EXPANDING AVENUES FOR CONSTRUCTIVE PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT DECISION-MAKING. 
 
SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE WAR 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) DONJI LAPAC SUFFERED MIGHTILY IN 1995, THOUGH NOT 
APPARENTLY IN THE FIGHTING TO RETAKE THE TOWN.  IT WAS IN THE 
DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE REASSERTION OF CROATIAN 
CONTROL THAT MANY OF THE SERB-OWNED HOUSES WERE DAMAGED OR 
DESTROYED.  NEARLY EIGHT YEARS LATER SIGNS OF THE WAR REMAIN 
LARGELY UNCHANGED -- OF 614 DAMAGED OR DESTROYED HOUSES ONLY 
54 HAVE BEEN REBUILT.  MANY HOMES STILL BEAR ON THEIR WALLS A 
HAND PAINTED SIGN OF THE TIME -- \"DON\'T BURN, RIJEKA POLICE\" 
-- INFORMING CROATS OF THE VARIOUS POLICE UNITS THAT WERE 
EITHER OCCUPYING OR USING THE HOUSES.  THE CENTER OF THE TOWN 
CONSISTS MOSTLY OF BOMBED OUT OR DESTROYED BUILDINGS.  THERE 
ARE NO STORES OR RESTAURANTS, AND THE ONE FORMER HOTEL IS 
BOARDED UP. 
 
3. (SBU) THE TOWN OF DONJI LAPAC DID NOT HAVE A CHURCH OF ANY 
CREED PRIOR TO THE WAR.  THE MUNICIPALITY HAD A TOTAL 
POPULATION OF 4,600 IN THE 1991 CENSUS, 4,460 OF WHOM WERE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00862  01 OF 02  180844Z 
SERBS.  CROATS MADE UP LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE 
POPULATION.  ALMOST ALL THE SERBS FLED THE REGION IN AUGUST 
1995 DURING OPERATION STORM.  THE GOC THEN INVITED BOSNIAN 
CROATS AND CROATS FROM OTHER PARTS OF CROATIA (SO-CALLED 
\"SETTLERS\") TO INHABIT THE AREA.  EVENTUALLY 178 BOSNIAN 
CROATS AND 254 CROAT SETTLERS ACCEPTED THE GOVERNMENT\'S OFFER 
AND TOOK UP RESIDENCY.  HOUSES AND APARTMENTS VACATED BY 
SERBS WERE OCCUPIED, AND MANY OF THESE WERE OCCUPIED 
ILLEGALLY -- THAT IS, WITHOUT OFFICIAL DECISIONS GRANTING 
TEMPORARY OCCUPANCY.  TODAY APPROXIMATELY 2,800 SERBS AND 450 
CROATS RESIDE IN THE MUNICIPALITY. 
 
4. (C) ACCORDING TO MILAN DJUKIC, THE MAYOR, 45 PRIVATELY 
OWNED HOMES STILL HAVE \"TEMPORARY OCCUPANTS,\" AND NO HOMES 
HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS.  HE SAID OF 
THESE, APPROXIMATELY 35 ARE OCCUPIED BY BOSNIAN CROATS WHO 
OWN HOMES IN BOSNIA, YET REMAIN IN CROATIA BECAUSE THEY 
EITHER CANNOT OR WILL NOT RETURN TO BOSNIA.  THE MAYOR 
STRESSED THAT RESTITUTION OF PROPERTY TO SERBS CANNOT BE 
DEALT WITH UNTIL THE SITUATION OF BOSNIAN CROATS IS RESOLVED. 
 HOWEVER, DJUKIC THEN SAID \"TO PREVENT SERBS FROM RETURNING\" 
IS THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT.  HE FURTHER ACCUSED THE 
GOVERNMENT WITH \"CONTINUING A POLICY OF ETHNIC CLEANSING OF 
THE POPULATION.\"  DJUKIC WAS NOT ABLE TO SQUARE HIS 
INFLAMMATORY ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WITH HIS 
CLAIM THAT THE SERB POPULATION OF DONJI LAPAC CONTINUES TO 
INCREASE, AND WILL AGAIN LIKELY REACH NEARLY 100 PERCENT. 
 
THE MUNICIPALITY

PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00862  01 OF 02  180844Z 
5. (SBU) DONJI LAPAC MUNICIPALITY IS IN LIKA, CLOSE TO THE 
BOSNIAN BORDER, OVER THREE HOURS SOUTH OF ZAGREB BY CAR. 
VERY POOR ROADS EFFECTIVELY ISOLATE THE REGION, WHICH IN 
WINTER MONTHS CAN BE COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF 
CROATIA.  THE REGION WAS ORIENTED TRADITIONALLY TOWARD BIHAC 
IN BOSNIA, WHICH IS LESS THAN 20 MILES TO THE NORTH.  LIKE 
OTHER TOWNS AND MUNICIPALITIES IN THE WAR-AFFECTED AREAS, 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.  OUTSIDE SMALL-SCALE FAMILY 
RUN AGRICULTURE, THERE ARE ALMOST NO JOBS OTHER THAN 
GOVERNMENT JOBS.  HOWEVER, THOSE JOBS ARE RARELY OPEN TO 
SERBS OR RETURNEES.  THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SERB ON THE POLICE 
FORCE OF 60 OFFICERS.  ONLY TWO OF THE 30 EMPLOYEES OF LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION ARE SERBS.  DJUKIC TOLD US THERE 
ARE NO SERB TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL, ALTHOUGH LATER WE WERE 
TOLD THAT TWO PART-TIME TEACHERS COME CONDUCT SERBIAN 
LANGUAGE CLASSES. 
 
6. (C) ALL NGOS AGREED THAT PEOPLE FEEL DISAPPOINTED WITH THE 
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.  THERE ARE NO MEANINGFUL AVENUES FOR 
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE MUNICIPALITY, 
AND VERY LITTLE HAPPENS WITHOUT THE MAYOR\'S EXPRESSED 
APPROVAL OR PARTICIPATION.  A YOUNG WOMAN WITH A SOCIAL 
SERVICE NGO SAID THE CURRENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE REMINDED 
HER OF HOW IT WAS UNDER SOCIALISM.  THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY.

 ACCORDING TO THE NGOS WE SPOKE WITH, THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE 
OF THE MUNICIPAL BUDGET, OR HOW DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE.

TOLD US THAT THEY WAITED NEARLY A YEAR TO GET A MEETING WITH 
THE MAYOR, WHOSE OFFICE IS A STONE\'S THROW AWAY. 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
--------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) SOME RAYS OF HOPE EXIST ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT. 
AGRICULTURE WAS THE MAINSTAY OF THE REGION, AND EFFORTS ARE 
UNDERWAY TO REVITALIZE THIS SECTOR.  MOST FARMERS RAISED 
LIVESTOCK -- CATTLE, SHEEP, AND HORSES -- AND SOME 
SMALL-SCALE DAIRY ACTIVITY HAS RESTARTED.  PLANS ARE AT THE 
FEASIBILITY STAGE FOR A LARGE-SCALE POULTRY-PROCESSING PLAN, 
WHICH WOULD RELY ON LOCAL FARMERS FOR SUPPLY OF CHICKENS. 
HOWEVER, ACCESS TO FINANCING REMAINS A HUGE OBSTACLE.  DUE TO 
DESTRUCTION OR LOSS OF LAND RECORDS IN THE WAR, FEW FARMERS 
ARE ABLE TO PROVE OWNERSHIP OF LAND, THE ONLY REAL COLLATERAL 
THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE FOR A LOAN.  ZAMIR.NET, A USAID FUNDED 
NGO PROVIDING INTERNET ACCESS AND TRAINING, ARE WORKING MORE 
AND MORE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ON JOB SEARCH SKILLS AND 
TECHNIQUES, AND THEY ARE TEACHING LOCAL BUSINESSMEN WEB 
MARKETING SKILLS.  ACCORDING TO ZAMIR.NET, EXPECTATIONS ARE 
HIGH, AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WANT TO ACQUIRE COMPUTER 
SKILLS SO THAT THEY CAN COMPETE FOR NEW JOBS.

INVOLVING REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL CITIZENS IN THE GOVERNANCE 
OF THE COMMUNITY, USAID HAS ALLOWED ITS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT 
WITH THE MUNICIPALITY TO LAPSE.  DONJI LAPAC FACES THE SAME 
PROBLEMS CONFRONTING MANY OTHER WAR-AFFECTED AREAS -- 
ISOLATION, DEPOPULATION, SEVERE UNEMPLOYMENT, LACK OF 
HOUSING, AND OBSOLETE, DAMAGED OR DESTROYED INFRASTRUCTURE -- 
PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF ONE MAN TO SOLVE, 
AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF THE 
BROADER COMMUNITY.  \"WEB MARKETING FOR BUSINESSMEN\" MAY NOT 
BE THE ANSWER AT THIS POINT IN TIME, BUT WHILE IT MAY SEEM 
FANCIFUL, IT DOES INDICATE AT LEAST SOME PEOPLE ARE HOPEFUL 
ABOUT THE FUTURE.  THE CHALLENGE IN THE NEAR TERM WILL BE TO 
MEET AT LEAST MINIMALLY SOME OF THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE 
COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) BASED ON MEETINGS WITH KEY GOC AND GOBIH OFFICIALS IN 
CROATIA IN RECENT WEEKS, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT 
TYPES AND LEVELS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT THE GOC IS PROVIDING TO 
ETHNIC CROATS IN BOSNIA -- TARGETED LARGELY TO THREE AREAS: 
PENSIONS FOR FORMER HVO SOLDIERS, REFUGEE RETURNS, AND 
CULTURAL COOPERATION.  MOST OF THE BENEFICIARIES ARE CROATIAN 
CITIZENS.  THE GOC IS SEEKING TO ENSURE THAT ALL AID IS 
COORDINATED WITH THE RELEVANT GOBIH MINISTRIES AND IS 
PROVIDED IN A TRANSPARENT WAY.  THE GOC MAINTAINS CONTROL 
OVER THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE ASSISTANCE IS CHANNELED TO BIH, 
THUS ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITY THAT EXTREMIST BOSNIAN CROAT 
LEADERS WILL MISUSE THE FUNDING AS WAS THE CASE -- AND 
PROBABLY THE INTENT -- WITH THE TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
2.  (C) WE ARE REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS A 
TRANSPARENT PROCESS AT WORK AND THAT THE GOC, UNLIKE ITS 
PREDECESSOR, IS SEEKING TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN BIH. 
WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME CONCERNS OVER CONTINUED PENSION 
PAYMENTS, THESE PAYMENTS WERE APPROVED AS PART OF THE DAYTON 
PROCESS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO COMPLAINTS BY IC OFFICIALS IN 
BOSNIA CONCERNING SUCH ASSISTANCE, WHICH IS RELATIVELY MODEST 
COMPARED TO FIVE YEARS AGO. OFFICIALS WE MET TO DISCUSS THESE 
MATTERS INCLUDE THE HEAD OF THE MFA,S NEIGHBORING RELATIONS 
DEPARTMENT, FILIP VUCAK; ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR THE OFFICE OF 
DISPLACED PERSONS AND REFUGEES, LOVRE PEJKOVIC; AND THE BIH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

AMBASSADOR TO CROATIA, ZLATKO DIZDAREVIC. END SUMMARY. 
 
PENSIONS/SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) AT THE TOP OF THE GOC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO CROATS IN 
BOSNIA ARE PENSION PAYMENTS TO FORMER HVO SOLDIERS AND THEIR 
BENEFICIARIES.  THE SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM IS BETWEEN 3 AND 5 
MILLION USD MONTHLY, WHICH COVERS A TOTAL OF ABOUT 10,000 
BENEFICIARIES.  THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PAYMENTS IS OVERSEEN 
BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOR AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN CROATIA IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH ITS COUNTERPART IN BIH. 
 
4.  (C) THE GOC DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE FOR MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT/TRAINING OR SALARIES FOR BOSNIAN CROATS SERVING IN 
THE FEDERATION ARMY.  UNDER THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
MILITARY MATTERS (SCMM) ARRANGEMENT, AND PURSUANT TO A 
BILATERAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOC AND GOBIH, SUCH DIRECT 
SUPPORT WOULD BE CHANNELED THROUGH THE RELEVANT MINISTRIES IN 
THE BIH GOVERNMENT IN A CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT WAY.  ABOUT 
THREE MONTHS AGO, THERE WAS A DEBATE WITHIN CROATIA BASED ON 
COMPLAINTS THAT FORMER HVO SOLDIERS WERE BEING PAID PENSIONS 
AT LOWER LEVELS THAN SOLDIERS IN CROATIA.  THE GOC IS 
REVIEWING THE ISSUE AND IS CONSIDERING INCREASING THE 
PENSIONS PAID TO FORMERS HVO SOLDIERS TO BRING THEM ON PAR 
WITH THEIR HV COUNTERPARTS.  THIS WOULD MEAN ADDING TO THE 
EXISTING BUDGET FOR THIS ITEM BETWEEN $200,000 AND $600,000 A 
YEAR FOR THE INCREASED PAYMENTS. 
 
REFUGEE ASSISTANCE 
------------------ 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00866  01 OF 02  181415Z 
 
5. (C) SINCE 2001, THE GOC HAS BUDGETED ABOUT 3 MILLION USD 
PER YEAR AS PART OF A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP BOSNIAN CROATS 
CURRENTLY LIVING IN CROATIA MOVE BACK TO BOSNIA.  THE GOC 
PROVIDES HOUSING MATERIALS TO BOSNIAN CROATS WHO, IN RETURN, 
SIGN CONTRACTS STIPULATING THEY WILL VACATE THE HOUSES THEY 
OCCUPY IN CROATIA ONCE THEIR HOMES IN BIH HAVE BEEN 
RECONSTRUCTED.  ASSISTANT MINISTER PEJKOVIC DIRECTLY OVERSEES 
THIS PROGRAM AND WORKS WITH HIS BIH COUNTERPART TO ENSURE 
THAT THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT ALREADY RECEIVED ASSISTANCE FROM 
THE IC OR GOBIH.  IT IS A \"SELF HELP\" PROGRAM WHEREBY OWNERS 
ARE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION THEMSELVES. 
THE PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN WELL MANAGED.  COMPLAINTS BY 
BENEFICIARIES ARE RAMPANT OVER THE PROCESS IN WHICH THE 
MATERIALS ARE DELIVERED (IN THREE STAGES), HIGH EXPENSES 
PLACED ON THE OWNERS TO COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION, AND LACK OF 
GOC INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROCESS.  WHILE FUNDS FOR MATERIALS 
FOR OVER 300 HOUSES HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED, MANY OF THESE HOUSES 
HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED (SEE REFTELS). 
 
CULTURAL COOPERATION 
-------------------- 
 
6. (C) THE GOC ALSO ALLOCATES 3 MILLION USD PER YEAR TO 
IMPROVE CULTURAL, RELIGIOUS, AND EDUCATIONAL TIES WITH CROATS 
IN BOSNIA.  THESE FUNDS ARE PROVIDED IN A TRANSPARENT WAY IN 
COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT GOBIH MINISTRIES.  THE GOC MFA

THIS IS TRUE COMPARED TO THE $85 MILLION PER YEAR THE TUDJMAN 
GOVERNMENT USED TO PROVIDE TO THE BOSNIAN CROATS DURING AND 
AFTER THE WAR.  THIS MONEY, WHICH WAS CHANNELED THROUGH THE 
NOW DEFUNCT HERCEGOVACKA BANKA, WAS SUPPOSED TO BE USED TO 
PURCHASE MILITARY EQUIPMENT, PAY SALARIES OF HVO SOLDIERS,

8. (C) BIH AMBASSADOR TO CROATIA DIZDAREVIC TOLD US THAT THE 
GOC DOES NOT PROVIDE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO THE GOBIH FOR HEALTH 
INSURANCE FOR ETHNIC CROATS IN BOSNIA.  RATHER, THE GOC 
ALLOWS THEM TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE IN CROATIA AT COSTS 
SIMILAR TO WHAT CROATIAN CITIZENS PAY.  THEY ARE NOT TREATED 
AS FOREIGNERS, WHO PAY HIGHER COSTS.  CROATS IN BOSNIA THAT 
USE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IN BOSNIA RECEIVE COVERAGE UNDER

COMMENT

9. (C) WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT GOC-PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO 
CROATS IN BOSNIA IS TRANSPARENT AND DONE IN COOPERATION WITH 
GOBIH OFFICIALS.  THE TYPES OF ASSISTANCE BEING PROVIDED 
OUGHT TO HAVE A STABILIZING EFFECT IN BIH.  IT ALSO ALLOWS 
THE GOC TO CLAIM CREDIT FOR SEEKING TO MAINTAIN GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBOR.  AMBASSADOR DIZDAREVIC TOLD US 
THAT THE GOBIH DOES NOT HAVE ANY MISGIVINGS ABOUT GOC 
INTENTIONS WITHIN BOSNIA AND IS PLEASED WITH THE ROLE THE GOC 
IS PLAYING.  THE GOC WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF 
SUPPORT IT IS PROVIDING TO CROATS IN BOSNIA, PARTICULARLY 
PENSION PAYMENTS AND ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZED HEALTH CARE. 
RESOLVING THE ISSUE OF DUAL CITIZENSHIP WILL BE THE ONLY WAY 
FOR THE GOC TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE.

CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00898  01 OF 02  231534Z 
 
1.  (C) SPLIT, CROATIA\'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY, SHOULD BE A 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUCCESS STORY.  BUT EVEN THOUGH CITY 
REVENUES ARE UP, DEBTS HAVE BEEN RETIRED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE 
AND A SERIES OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS ARE PLANNED, 
SPLIT\'S LEADERS ARE A STEP AWAY FROM DISBANDING THE 
MULTI-PARTY CITY GOVERNMENT.  THE PROBLEM IS NATIONAL-LEVEL 
POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP MIXED WITH THE DESIRE OF SOME LOCAL 
POLITICIANS TO GET THEIR SLICES OF THE PATRONAGE PIE.  UNLESS 
A COMPLICATED DEAL IS CUT, THE COALITION GOVERNMENT IN SPLIT 
COULD FALL, EMBARRASSING NATIONAL-LEVEL LEADERS AS THEY 
PREPARE FOR ELECTIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) A LOCAL-LEVEL POWER-SHARING DEAL BROKERED IN FEBRUARY 
2002 BETWEEN THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP) AND THE 
CROATIAN SOCIAL LIBERAL PARTY (HSLS) CALLS FOR SPLIT MAYOR 
SLOBODAN BEROS (SDP) TO STEP DOWN AT THE END OF THE SUMMER 
AND HAND THE KEYS OF THE CITY TO HSLS DEPUTY MAYOR MIROSLAV 
BULICIC.  WHEN THE HSLS BROKE APART IN JULY 2002 AT THE 
NATIONAL LEVEL (AFTER PARTY PRESIDENT DRAZEN BUDISA LEFT THE 
GOVERNMENT), THE SDP-HSLS COALITION IN SPLIT REMAINED IN 
PLACE.  NOW BUDISA IS TRYING TO FORCE THE HSLS MEMBERS OF THE 
CITY GOVERNMENT TO RESIGN AND FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT WITH THE 
NATIONALIST OPPOSITION HDZ. 
 
3.  (C) THE LOCAL HSLS IS DIVIDED EVENLY BETWEEN THOSE LOYAL 
TO THE NATIONAL-LEVEL PARTY AND THOSE WHO WANT TO STAY IN 
OFFICE WITH THE SDP.  BULICIC TOLD US THAT VOTERS ELECTED 
HSLS TOGETHER WITH SDP AND WOULD NEVER FORGIVE THEM IF THEY 
FORMED A COALITION WITH HDZ.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, ASSERTED 
BULICIC, THE CITY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS: 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00898  01 OF 02  231534Z 
THE CITY\'S WAR-ERA DEBT HAS BEEN FULLY RETIRED (AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE), UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN, CITY SERVICES ARE PERFORMING 
AT TOP LEVELS, CITY TAX REVENUES ARE ABOVE EXPECTATIONS AND 
THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING SEVERAL IMPORTANT NEW 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BEGINNING THIS FALL. 
 
4.  (C) BULICIC ALSO HAS HIS OWN PERSONAL MOTIVATIONS.  TO 
BECOME MAYOR, HE MUST FIRST STEP DOWN AS DEPUTY MAYOR AND 
RESUME HIS SEAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL.  WHEN HE DOES THIS, HE 
WILL ALSO HAVE TO STEP DOWN AS HEAD OF SPLIT CITY SANITATION, 
A WELL-PAYING JOB WITH PLENTY OF PATRONAGE POSITIONS AT HIS 
DISPOSAL.  BULICIC HOPES TO OFFSET THIS LOSS OF LUCRE BY 
INSISTING THAT THE SDP GIVE HIM THE POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF 
\"PLOVPUT,\" THE STATE-LEVEL ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBLE FOR 
MAINTAINING NAVIGATIONAL AIDS IN CROATIA\'S INLAND WATERS. 
(SINCE THIS IS A STATE-LEVEL APPOINTMENT, THERE WOULD BE NO 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH HIS POSITION AS CITY COUNCILOR.) 
 
5.  (C) SDP OFFICIALS ARE EXASPERATED AT BULICIC\'S BLATANT 
INSISTENCE AT BEING COMPENSATED FOR HIS LOSS OF INCOME (CITY 
COUNCILORS RECEIVE NO SALARY).  THEY POINT OUT THAT SINCE THE 
MAYOR\'S JOB IS A FULL-TIME PAID POSITION, BULICIC WOULD HAVE 
TO RESIGN ONCE HE LEAVES THE COUNCIL TO BECOME MAYOR. 
BULICIC MAY BRING DOWN THE CITY GOVERNMENT JUST FOR A FEW 
MONTHS\' INCOME AS HEAD OF PLOVPUT.  \"WHEN IT COMES TO 
POLITICS IN CROATIA, GOOD PERFORMANCE JUST IS NOT ONE OF THE 
CRITERIA USED TO DECIDE WHO SERVES,\" EXPLAINED VELJAN 
RADOJKOVIC, WHO SERVES AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
NATIONAL-LEVEL GOVERNMENT IN SPLIT-DALMATIA COUNTY. 
 
6.  (C) MARIN JURJEVIC, A LEADING SDP MP WHO IS ALSO THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00898  01 OF 02  231534Z 
CHAIR OF THE SPLIT SDP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, ADMITTED THAT 
BULICIC HAS COALITION PARTIES OVER A BARREL.  THE CITY 
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE A POOR JOB OF BLOWING ITS OWN HORN; AS 
WITH THE REST OF CROATIA, MOST RESIDENTS ARE DISSATISFIED 
WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT.  WITH ELECTIONS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE 
IN THE FALL, THE LOSS OF CROATIA\'S SECOND CITY WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT TO RECOVER FROM.  JURJEVIC TOLD US HE GUARANTEED 
BULICIC THE MAYOR POSITION, BUT HAS NOT (YET) GIVEN IN ON THE 
ASSIGNMENT TO PLOVPUT. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C) HSLS PRESIDENT BUDISA IS DESPERATE TO BRING DOWN THE 
SPLIT GOVERNMENT AND HAS ALREADY SHOWN HE IS READY TO HIT 
BELOW THE BELT TO ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME.  UNDER HIS 
LEADERSHIP, HSLS WENT FROM BEING THE SECOND-LARGEST POLITICAL 
PARTY IN THE COALITION TO THE BRINK OF POLITICAL IRRELEVANCE. 
 HE SEEKS TO SABOTAGE THE COALITION\'S ABILITY TO TAKE CREDIT 
FOR SPLIT\'S SUCCESS AND INCREASE THE VALUE OF HIS PARTY IN A 
POTENTIAL COALITION WITH THE HDZ.  THE SDP WANTS TO KEEP 
SPLIT -- THE ONLY CITY WHERE THEY ARE IN GOVERNMENT IN 
NATIONALIST-LEANING DALMATIA -- ON THEIR SIDE.

REF: A. STATE 92865 
     B. 02 STATE 253531 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF ROB SILBERSTEIN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (SBU) POST WELCOMES DEPARTMENT\'S DECISION TO LAUNCH AN 
EXBS PROGRAM IN CROATIA AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT 
ON THE EXBS PROGRAM \"ROAD MAP\" (REF A).  THE TECHNICAL 
PROGRAMS AND TRAINING THAT COME WITH THE EXBS PROGRAM GIVE US 
ADDED LEVERAGE TO FOSTER INCREASED GOC COOPERATION ON 
REGIONAL SECURITY AND ARMS CONTROL ISSUES. 
 
THE EXBS ENVIRONMENT IN CROATIA 
------------------------------- 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00914  01 OF 02  250603Z 
2. (SBU) THE ASSISTANCE ENVIRONMENT IN CROATIA IS COMPLEX AND 
HAS CHANGED MARKEDLY SINCE THE EXBS ASSESSMENT TEAM CAME TO 
ZAGREB IN MARCH 2002.  CROATIA, UNDER THE EU\'S STABILIZATION 
AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT, HAS BEGUN TO RECEIVE MILLIONS OF 
EUROS IN ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE EU/CARDS PROGRAM. 
APPROXIMATELY EURO 14 MILLION PER YEAR FROM 2002 TO 2004 IS 
EARMARKED FOR BORDER CONTROL, POLICE AND CUSTOMS REFORM AND 
ASYLUM ISSUES.  EU MEMBER STATES ALSO PROVIDE LIMITED 
BILATERAL ASSISTANCE ON BORDER SECURITY ISSUES.  THE USG, 
THROUGH THE INL- AND SEED-FUNDED PROGRAMS PROVIDES 
APPROXIMATELY USD 1.5 MILLION PER YEAR IN ASSISTANCE FOR 
POLICE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR REFORM.  U.S. PROGRAMS ARE 
DUE TO PHASE OUT IN FY 2004.  WE RECENTLY ALSO LAUNCHED THE 
DOD-MANAGED WMD COUNTER-PROLIFERATION PROGRAM.  OUR CHALLENGE 
IS TO ENSURE THAT THE EXBS PROGRAM COMPLEMENTS AND DOES NOT 
COMPETE WITH THESE EXISTING INITIATIVES. 
 
3. (C) THE EU FACTOR IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.  CROATIA\'S 
PRINCIPAL FOREIGN POLICY GOAL IS EU MEMBERSHIP.  OUR 
EXPERIENCE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT CROATIAN POLICY-MAKERS 
WILL SHY AWAY FROM IMPLEMENTING ANY INITIATIVE SHOULD THEY 
BELIEVE THAT ITS PRESCRIPTIONS ARE IN CONFLICT WITH EU 
RECOMMENDATIONS OR PROGRAMS. 
 
4. (SBU) WHILE THE ASSISTANCE FIELD IS CROWDED, THE EXBS 
PROGRAM ADDRESSES A UNIQUE NEED.  THE EU\'S PROGRAMS ARE 
FOCUSED ON CROATIA\'S EXTENSIVE UNDER-MANNED AND 
UNDER-EQUIPPED LAND BORDER: CROATIAN PORTS AND MARITIME 
SECURITY ISSUES LARGELY HAVE BEEN IGNORED BY THE EU.  NEITHER 
DOES THE CARDS PROGRAM ENVISION INITIATIVES TO STRENGTHEN 
CROATIAN CONTROLS OVER ARMS AND DUAL USE EXPORTS.  U.S. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00914  01 OF 02  250603Z 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS COULD PROVIDE A 
USEFUL LAUNCHING PAD FOR SOME EXBS INITIATIVES, BUT THEIR 
EMPHASIS LAYS ELSEWHERE. 
 
5. (C) DURING OUR BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS IN FEBRUARY 
2003, GOC REPRESENTATIVES ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE LACK OF 
INTER-AGENCY COOPERATION SERIOUSLY DEGRADED CROATIA\'S ABILITY 
TO CONTROL ITS BORDERS AND TO MANAGE CRISES.  WHILE SOME 
REFORMERS IN THE GOC ARE READY TO CREATE AN INTER-AGENCY 
COMMITTEE TO COORDINATE BORDER AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT ISSUES, 
BUREAUCRATIC RESISTANCE WITHIN THE GOC HAS STYMIED THIS 
INITIATIVE TO DATE.  BY TARGETING OUR EXBS ASSISTANCE, WE 
HOPE TO ENCOURAGE THE GOC TO STAND UP SUCH A COMMITTEE IN 
ORDER TO MANAGE THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD FLOW FROM THE EXBS 
AND WMD PROGRAMS.  SUCH A SINGLE FOCAL POINT WOULD MAKE OUR 
ASSISTANCE DELIVERY MORE EFFICIENT AS WELL AS ENHANCE THE 
OVERALL BORDER SECURITY/CRISIS MANAGEMENT CAPACITY OF 
CROATIA.

SUBJECT: WHO SHIELDED ICTY PIFWC IVICA RAJIC? 
 
REF: ZAGREB 761 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF ROBERT SILBERSTEIN, REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C/NF) CROATIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TELL US THAT 
THEY HAVE UNCOVERED EVIDENCE OF A SYSTEMATIC, CLANDESTINE 
EFFORT OF THE FORMER HDZ GOVERNMENT TO SHIELD ETHNIC CROAT 
PIFWCS -- INCLUDING IVICA RAJIC -- FROM JUSTICE.  THEY HAVE 
LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION TO UPROOT THAT SUPPORT NETWORK AND 
INDICT ITS ORGANIZERS.  THEY SPECULATED THAT THERE IS OVERLAP 
BETWEEN THE RAJIC NETWORK AND THOSE THAT AID ICTY PIFWC ANTE 
GOTOVINA, BUT SAID THEY HAVE NO PROOF THUS FAR. 
 
2. (C/NF) WHILE THE INVESTIGATION MIGHT EMBARRASS THE HDZ, IT 
ALSO MIGHT RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW SUCH A NETWORK COULD 
CONTINUE TO OPERATE DURING THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S MANDATE, 
PARTICULARLY AS THERE WERE INDICATIONS IN LATE 2000 OF AN 
ORGANIZED PIFWC PROTECTION EFFORT.  THE GOC WILL REQUIRE 
CONTINUED EXTERNAL PRESSURE TO ENSURE THAT IT PROSECUTES 
THOSE WHO SEEK TO STYMIE THE WORK OF THE ICTY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
STATUS OF THE RAJIC CASE 
------------------------ 
 
    3. (C) THE APRIL 5 ARREST IN SPLIT OF BOSNIAN CROAT ICTY 
FUGITIVE IVICA RAJIC BROUGHT TO A CLOSE AN EIGHT-MONTH 
MANHUNT CONDUCTED BY A SPECIAL UNIT OF THE CROATIAN POLICE 
(REFTEL).  THE CROATIAN SUPREME COURT ON APRIL 23 AUTHORIZED 
THE ZAGREB COUNTRY COURT TO ADJUDICATE THE ICTY TRANSFER 
PROCESS.  ALTHOUGH RAJIC\'S ATTORNEY HAS FILED AN APPEAL 
DEMANDING THAT RAJIC\'S TRIAL BE HELD IN CROATIA, OUR GOC 
CONTACTS TOLD US THE DEFENSE MOTION ONLY HAS NUISANCE VALUE 
AND THAT RAJIC WILL BE TRANSFERRED BY MID-MAY. 
 
INVESTIGATION DETAILS 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C/NF) ACCORDING TO DIRECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE RANKO 
OSTOJIC AND CHIEF PROSECUTOR MLADEN BAJIC, THE CROATIAN 
POLICE IN MID-2002 CAME ACROSS INFORMATION THAT RAJIC\'S WIFE 
WAS LIVING IN A MINISTRY OF DEFENSE-OWNED APARTMENT AND WAS 
WORKING AT AN MOD FACILITY IN SPLIT.  A SMALL UNIT OF POLICE 
OFFICERS THAT OSTOJIC TRUSTED WAS FORMED TO STAKE OUT THE 
LOCATIONS -- AS WELL AS A CAFE THOUGHT TO BE OWNED BY RAJIC 
-- BUT THE TEAM HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE FUGITIVE. 
 
5. (C/NF) BAJIC TOLD US THAT THE BREAK IN THE CASE CAME ABOUT 
TWO MONTHS AGO, WHEN A LOCAL INFORMANT IN SPLIT GAVE POLICE 
NEW DETAILS ABOUT RAJIC\'S COVER IDENTITY, ALLOWING THE POLICE 
TO ARREST THE PIFWC.  BAJIC SAID THAT THE CROATIAN POLICE 
RECEIVED NO OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE IN WHAT WAS A VERY CLOSE-HOLD 
CASE.  ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, OSTOJIC TOLD US THAT HE 
WOULD NOT SHARE ANY DETAILS OF THE RAJIC OPERATION WITH HIS 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE COLLEAGUES BECAUSE OF FEARS THAT 
HDZ-SYMPATHIZERS INSIDE THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WOULD TIP HIM OFF 
    AND DRIVE RAJIC DEEPER UNDERGROUND. 
 
WHO PROTECTED RAJIC? 
-------------------- 
 
6. (C) BAJIC SAID THAT HE AND OSTOJIC ARE PUSHING A \"FURIOUS\" 
INVESTIGATION TO IDENTIFY AND INDICT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT 
SHELTERED RAJIC.  BAJIC BELIEVES THAT THERE MUST BE OVERLAP 
BETWEEN THOSE WHO ABETTED RAJIC AND THOSE WHO FORMED THE 
SUPPORT NETWORK OF PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA, ALTHOUGH THE POLICE 
HAVE NOT YET UNCOVERED EVIDENCE SUPPORTING HIS THESIS. 
 
7. (C/NF) IN THE COURSE OF THE RAJIC INVESTIGATION, CROATIAN 
AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THEY HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE OF A SYSTEMATIC 
EFFORT OF THE FORMER HDZ GOVERNMENT TO SHIELD ETHNIC-CROAT 
PIFWCS FROM ARREST.  THEY SHARED WITH US A JUNE 1998 BRIEFING 
PAPER PREPARED FOR PRESIDENT TUDJMAN BY THEN HEAD OF CROATIAN 
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE (SIS) MARKICA REBIC.  INTER ALIA, THE 
PAPER -- WHICH WE BELIEVE IS GENUINE -- OUTLINES CROATIAN 
EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (HIS) COVERT OPERATIONS AGAINST 
ICTY AND EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ICTY DOCUMENTS REGARDING ONGOING 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
8. (C) THE DOCUMENT ALSO DESCRIBES HOW THE SIS PROTECTED

BETWEEN THOSE WHO ABETTED RAJIC AND THOSE WHO FORMED THE 
SUPPORT NETWORK OF PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA, ALTHOUGH THE POLICE 
HAVE NOT YET UNCOVERED EVIDENCE SUPPORTING HIS THESIS. 
 
7. (C/NF) IN THE COURSE OF THE RAJIC INVESTIGATION, CROATIAN 
AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THEY HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE OF A SYSTEMATIC 
EFFORT OF THE FORMER HDZ GOVERNMENT TO SHIELD ETHNIC-CROAT 
PIFWCS FROM ARREST.  THEY SHARED WITH US A JUNE 1998 BRIEFING 
PAPER PREPARED FOR PRESIDENT TUDJMAN BY THEN HEAD OF CROATIAN 
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE (SIS) MARKICA REBIC.  INTER ALIA, THE 
PAPER -- WHICH WE BELIEVE IS GENUINE -- OUTLINES CROATIAN 
EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (HIS) COVERT OPERATIONS AGAINST 
ICTY AND EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ICTY DOCUMENTS REGARDING ONGOING 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
8. (C) THE DOCUMENT ALSO DESCRIBES HOW THE SIS PROTECTED 
 
ZAGREB 00000925  002.1 OF 002 
 
SPECTS TO SFOR CAPTURE 
OPERATIONS AND ESTABLISHED SAFEHOUSES AND UNDERTOOK OTHER 
MEASURES (INCLUDING CHANGE OF IDENTITY) TO PROTECT THE 
INDICTEES.  BAJIC TELLS US THAT HE HAS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
THAT \"CONFIRMS\" THAT THE HDZ GOVERNMENT CHANNELED FUNDING FOR 
THE PIFWC PROTECTION OPERATIONS THROUGH HDZ MP LJUBO 
CESIC-ROJS (AT THE TIME ASSISTANT MINISTER OF DEFENSE FOR 
LOGISTICS), CIRO GRUBISIC, THEN-CROATIAN CONSUL GENERAL IN 
MOSTAR AND THE NOW-DEFUNCT HERCEGOVACKA BANKA.

8. (SBU) CROATIAN MEDIA IS RIFE WITH SPECULATION THAT THE EU 
REQUIRED THE GOC TO SUBMIT A LIST OF PERSONS SUSPECTED OF 
ABETTING PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA FOR INCLUSION IN THE EU TRAVEL 
BAN \"ON PERSONS IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA INVOLVED IN THE 
EVASION OF JUSTICE\" (ADOPTED AT THE EU GENERAL AFFAIRS 
COUNCIL APRIL 16).  PETER MARTIN, DEPUTY POLITICAL ADVISOR AT 
THE EC MISSION IN ZAGREB, SAID HE KNEW OF NO FORMAL EU 
REQUEST, BUT INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES MIGHT HAVE APPROACHED 
THE GOC.  FOR HIS PART, BAJIC TOLD US THAT HE WELCOMED EU AND 
U.S. EFFORTS TO STEP UP THE PRESSURE ON THOSE WHO AIDED AND 
ABETTED THE FLIGHT FROM JUSTICE OF INDICTED WAR CRIMINALS.

AMBASSADOR -- EMBARRASSED THE GOC AND OVERSHADOWED AN 
OTHERWISE SOLID ATTEMPT TO SENSITIZE THE CROATIAN PUBLIC TO 
IMPENDING NEW INDICTMENTS AFTER THE APRIL 16 VISIT OF ICTY 
PROSECUTOR CARLA DEL PONTE TO ZAGREB (REFTEL).  REACTING TO 
PRESS REPORTS THAT ZAGREB DIPLOMATS AGREED WITH DEL PONTE 
THAT GOC COOPERATION WITH ICTY WAS HALF-HEARTED, GRANIC, 
INTER ALIA, CALLED ZAGREB-BASED DIPLOMATS \"SUPERFICIALLY 
INFORMED.\"  GRANIC\'S REMARKS DREW UNIFORMLY STINGING 
CRITICISM FROM THE LOCAL MEDIA AS WE AND OTHER MISSIONS 
REFUSED TO COMMENT AND LEFT THE GOC TO STEW IN ITS OWN 
EMBARRASSMENT.  PM RACAN, WHO COUNTS ON GRANIC TO SUPPORT 
THE COALITION AND TO MANAGE THE GOC, EVENTUALLY SAID THAT 
HIS DEPUTY\'S VIEWS WERE \"PERSONAL\" AND DID NOT REFLECT THE 
GOC\'S POSITION.  MEANWHILE, ICTY INDICTEE GENERAL JANKO 
BOBETKO CHECKED HIMSELF OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, A POTENTIALLY 
DISTURBING TWIST TO A CASE THAT ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO, THE GOC 
AND THE OTP BOTH BELIEVED WAS CLOSED.  END SUMMARY 
 
FOOT IN MOUTH DISEASE 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (U) IN AN APRIL 22 INTERVIEW TO THE NEWS DAILY \"NOVI 
LIST,\" DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GORAN GRANIC COMMENTED ON OTP 
CHIEF PROSECUTOR CARLA DEL PONTE\'S APRIL 16 VISIT TO 
ZAGREB.  GRANIC REMARKED THAT CROATIA WAS COOPERATING FULLY 
WITH THE ICTY AND COMMITTED THE GOC TO DELIVER TO THE HAGUE 
ANY NEW INDICTEES WITHOUT DELAY.  (CROATIAN MEDIA SOURCES 
SPECULATE THAT DEL PONTE IS SET TO DELIVER UP TO FIVE NEW 
INDICTMENTS AGAINST FORMER CROATIAN OFFICIALS: ADMIRAL 
DAVOR DOMAZET, GENERALS IVAN KORADE AND MLADEN MARKAC, AND 
FORMER PRIME MINISTERS HRVOJE SARINIC AND FRANJO GREGURIC.)

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00927  01 OF 02  280635Z 
 
3.  (SBU) THE INTERVIEW WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR GRANIC\'S 
PETULANT REACTION TO THE INTERVIEWER\'S REMARK THAT FOREIGN 
DIPLOMATS AGREED WITH DEL PONTE\'S ASSESSMENT THAT CROATIA 
ONLY COOPERATED WITH THE ICTY RELUCTANTLY.  GRANIC SAID 
SOME DIPLOMATS \"PROVED NOT TO BE UP TO THE MARK,\" WERE 
SOMETIMES \"RIDICULOUS IN THE WAY THEY MADE JUDGMENTS\" AND 
MADE STATEMENTS THAT WERE \"DOWNRIGHT TRAGIC.\"  ASKED TO 
NAME THE DIPLOMATS, GRANIC LISTED: \"MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH 
EMBASSY, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR, THE FORMER SPANISH 
AMBASSADOR, DUTCH OFFICIALS,\" AND \"OTHER SUPERFICIALLY 
INFORMED DIPLOMATS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF SOME 
INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN CROATIA.\" 
 
4.  (SBU) GRANIC\'S INTERVIEW IGNITED A MEDIA FIRESTORM, 
EVEN AS WE, AND OTHER MISSIONS, BIT OUR TONGUES.  A 
COLUMNIST FOR NOVI LIST EXCORIATED HIM FOR USING A \"TONE 
THAT IS NOT TO BE USED EVEN WITH ONE\'S OWN STAFF,\" ADDING 
THAT GRANIC HIMSELF HELPED FOSTER THE IMPRESSION THAT 
CROATIA COOPERATED UNWILLINGLY, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF 
GENERAL BOBETKO.  ANOTHER COMMENTATOR FOR THE SAME PAPER 
SAID GRANIC\'S STATEMENTS COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN IRAQ 
UNDER SADDAM OR IN AFGHANISTAN UNDER THE TALIBAN, BUT NOT 
IN A MODERN EUROPEAN COUNTRY THAT CROATIA ASPIRES TO 
BECOME.  FOCUSING ON THE GOC\'S EU ACCESSION DRIVE, ONE 
COMMENTATOR SAID, \"WITH ONLY ONE MOVE, GRANIC MANAGED TO 
ANNUL THE ENTIRE POSITIVE ATMOSPHERE THAT WAS PICKING UP IN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.\"  A FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY \"VJESNIK\" NOTED THAT 
GRANIC\'S WORDS RECALLED THE ATTITUDE OF THE HDZ GOVERNMENT, 
WHICH VIEWED ZAGREB\'S INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIVES AS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00927  01 OF 02  280635Z 
\"ENEMIES OF CROATIAN STATEHOOD.\" 
 
5. (SBU) GRANIC, HOWEVER, APPEARS TO HAVE AT LEAST SOME 
SYMPATHIZERS IN THE GOC.  UNNAMED FOREIGN MINISTRY SOURCES 
TOLD \"NOVI LIST\" THAT GRANIC MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNDIPLOMATIC, 
BUT THAT HE HAD \"AT LEAST TOLD THE TRUTH.\" \"AMBASSADORS MAY 
SPEAK LIKE THAT IN SOME BANTU STATE, BUT NOT IN CROATIA, 
WHICH IS A PART OF EUROPE.\" 
 
WE\'RE SORRY (WELL, SORT OF) 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) AT A APRIL 24 PRESS CONFERENCE, PM RACAN SOUGHT 
TO LIMIT DAMAGE, SAYING THAT HE REGRETTED GRANIC\'S REMARKS 
AND THAT THEY DID NOT REFLECT THE POLICY OF THE GOC.  AT 
THE SAME TIME, HE SOUGHT TO INSULATE HIS DEPUTY -- AND 
RIGHT HAND MAN -- FROM FURTHER CRITICISM, SAYING THAT 
INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT HAD THE RIGHT TO AIR 
THEIR PERSONAL VIEWS, WHICH MIGHT NOT BE, AND OFTEN WERE 
NOT, THOSE OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THERE WAS NO NEED FOR 
FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE ISSUE, RACAN MAINTAINED.

TO KEEP THE REGISTRAR AND THE PRESIDING ICTY JUDGE WELL 
INFORMED OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BOBETKO CASE.  IT IS 
POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGE MIGHT DECIDE THAT BOBETKO\'S 
DECISION TO REFUSE HOSPITAL TREATMENT IS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH 
A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCE TO WARRANT REACTIVATING THE ARREST 
ORDER.

SUBJECT: CROATIA WILL NOT ACCEPT TRANSFER OF NBY FUNDS 

REF: STATE 99664 (NOTAL) 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLECON COUNSELOR NICHOLAS HILL, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B AND 
D) 
 
1.  (C) ON APRIL 29, WE MET WITH MIROSLAV KOVACIC, HEAD OF 
THE AMERICAS DEPARTMENT AT THE MFA, AT HIS REQUEST.  KOVACIC 
SAID THE MINISTRY HAD HEARD FROM THE CROATIAN NATIONAL BANK 
(CNB) THAT IT HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO ACCEPT A TRANSFER OF 
$54.6 MILLION AS CROATIA\'S PART OF UNFROZEN NBY ASSETS IN THE 
U.S.  KOVACIC REFERRED BACK TO OUR DEMARCHES OVER THE LAST 
SEVERAL MONTHS, WHICH HAD DESCRIBED A PROCESS IN WHICH, IF 
THE USG DID NOT RECEIVE HOLD HARMLESS ASSURANCES FROM ALL 
PARTIES, THE USG WOULD PROCEED WITH A GENERAL UNBLOCKING. 
KOVACIC ASKED FOR CONFIRMATION THAT THE TELEX FROM THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK IN NEW YORK DID INDEED INDICATE THAT THE 
USG HAD DECIDED TO DISBURSE THE MONEY TO EACH SUCCESSOR STATE. 
 
2.  (C) USING REFTEL POINTS, WE CONFIRMED THAT THE USG HAD 
DECIDED THAT TRANSFERRING THE FUNDS DIRECTLY TO EACH 
GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAY TO 
GET THE ASSETS TO THE SUCCESSOR COUNTRIES.  WE STRESSED THAT 
WE WOULD BE CONCERNED IF CROATIA TOOK ANY LEGAL STEPS THAT 
WOULD INTERFERE WITH THIS EFFORT TO RESOLVE ISSUES LEFT OVER 
FROM THE MILOSEVIC ERA.  FINALLY, WE BELIEVED THAT THE ISSUE 
OF NBY ASSETS FROZEN IN THE US UNDER MILOSEVIC-ERA SANCTIONS 
AND THE AGREEMENT ON SUCCESSION ISSUES (ASI) SHOULD BE 
HANDLED SEPARATELY. 
 
3.  (C) KOVACIC COUNTERED THAT GOC LAWYERS SAID THE TWO 
    ISSUES WERE LINKED.  THE GOC COULD NOT ACCEPT THE MONEY, 
BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN ACCEPTING THE KEY OF THE ASI, WHICH 
HAD NOT BEEN RATIFIED BY PARLIAMENT.  HE EXPRESSED HIS 
STRONG, PERSONAL DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THIS OUTCOME WAS NOT IN 
LINE WITH WHAT THE USG HAD TOLD THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT. 
KOVACIC SAID CROATIA HAD BEEN VERY HOPEFUL WHEN THE USG 
OFFERED ASSISTANCE TO HELP OBTAIN AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAD 
HAPPENED TO THE NBY DEPOSITS -- AN OFFER THAT SEEMED TO 
DISAPPEAR SUDDENLY AFTER AN OFAC VISIT TO ZAGREB AND BELGRADE 
IN DECEMBER. 
 
4.  (C) WE EXPLAINED THAT THE OFFER WAS RESCINDED AFTER 
OFFICIAL VISITORS TO CROATIA, DISMAYED BY THE HARD LINE TAKEN 
BY CROATIAN INTERLOCUTORS, CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT 
CROATIA WAS NOT LOOKING FOR AN EXPLANATION THAT WOULD SMOOTH 
THE WAY TO RATIFICATION OF THE ASI, BUT RATHER FURTHER 
REASONS TO BE INTRANSIGENT AND TO DEMAND COMPENSATION.  WE 
REITERATED THAT IT WOULD BE UNWISE FOR CROATIA TO TRY TO 
BRING A COURT CASE AGAINST THE USG OVER THIS ISSUE.  KOVACIC 
SAID IT WAS TOO EARLY TO SAY, BUT IT MIGHT IN THE END BE 
NECESSARY.

PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00954  01 OF 02  301022Z 
1.  (C) CROATIA TOOK SOME TIME TO WARM TO THE IDEA OF THE 
ADRIATIC CHARTER.  BECAUSE OF ITS FEAR OF BEING TRAPPED IN A 
NEW BALKAN ALLIANCE AND ALSO BECAUSE OF AN ARROGANT 
ASSUMPTION THAT ITS MORE ADVANCED LEVEL OF ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT MADE IT A BETTER NATO CANDIDATE, CROATIA RESISTED 
TYING ITS FORTUNES TO ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA.  BUT CROATIA HAS 
SINCE BECOME AN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER OF THE CHARTER.  THE 
GOVERNMENT AND ESPECIALLY FM PICULA HAVE TAKEN US AT OUR WORD 
THAT EACH CANDIDATE WILL BE EVALUATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. 
 THEY ALSO REALIZE THAT BY SIGNING, CROATIA CAN DEMONSTRATE 
ITS COMMITMENT TO WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH OTHER 
PROSPECTIVE ALLIES.  FINALLY, PICULA HOPES THAT THE CHARTER 
WILL ENSURE THAT THE U.S. REMAINS COMMITTED TO FUTURE 
EXPANSION. 
 
2.  (C) WE EXPECT THAT THE SECRETARY\'S SCHEDULE WILL ALLOW 
VERY LITTLE TIME FOR SUBSTANTIVE CONVERSATION WITH FM PICULA. 
 THERE ARE, HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF ISSUES WHICH MAY COME UP IN 
WHICH THE SECRETARY\'S ENGAGEMENT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. 
 
-------------------------------- 
UN-FROZEN ASSETS FROM YUGOSLAVIA 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) CROATIA CONTINUES TO OBJECT TO OUR FORMULA TO 
UN-BLOCK FUNDS FROZEN IN THE U.S. BY MILOSEVIC-ERA SANCTIONS. 
 
POINT TO MAKE: 
 
- CROATIA NEEDS TO PUT THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST, AS OTHER 
SUCCESSOR STATES HAVE, AND ACCEPT THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS.

4.  (C) CROATIA HAS NOT BEGUN TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 
AGREEMENT, AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE ESSENTIAL TO CROATIA\'S 
MODERNIZATION AND INTEROPERABILITY GOALS IS IN JEOPARDY. 
 
POINT TO MAKE: 
 
- URGE YOU TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS FOR AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT 
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE JULY 1 DEADLINE IS LOOMING AND 
CROATIA MUST NOT COUNT ON A WAIVER. 
 
---------------- 
ICTY COOPERATION 
---------------- 
 
5.  (C) CROATIA MET THE TRIBUNAL\'S RECENT DEADLINES FOR 
COOPERATION, BUT ONLY AT THE LAST MINUTE AND ONLY UNDER HEAVY 
PRESSURE.  THE INDICTMENT WAS SERVED ON GENERAL BOBETKO, 
REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS ARE ON THE WAY TO BEING FULFILLED, AND 
FUGITIVE ICTY INDICTEE IVICA RAJIC HAS BEEN APPREHENDED. 
 
POINTS TO MAKE: 
 
- PROMPT AND FULL COOPERATION WITH ICTY IS ESSENTIAL AND 
NON-NEGOTIABLE AND IS A LITMUS TEST FOR CROATIA\'S READINESS 
TO ADVANCE IN THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATION INTO NATO AND THE 
EU. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00954  01 OF 02  301022Z 
 
- URGE YOU TO REDOUBLE YOUR EFFORTS TO APPREHEND ICTY 
FUGITIVE ANTE GOTOVINA. 
 
--------------- 
REFUGEE RETURNS 
--------------- 
 
6.  (C) CROATIA HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH ON THIS ISSUE.  DESPITE 
PROGRESS ON RECONSTRUCTION OF WAR-DAMAGED HOUSES, THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO MEET DEADLINES ON EVICTIONS OF 
THOUSANDS OF CROAT \"SQUATTERS\" IN HOMES BELONGING TO ETHNIC 
SERBS WHO FLED DURING THE WAR, NOR HAS IT MET COMMITMENTS TO 
COMPENSATE OWNERS.  NOW THE RACAN GOVERNMENT IS RESISTING 
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON THIS ISSUE. 
 
POINT TO MAKE: 
 
- IT IS THE CONSENSUS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT 
YOUR GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOING ENOUGH TO SUPPORT REFUGEE 
RETURNS.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE, AND UNTIL IT IS ADDRESSED 
IN A SERIOUS, SYSTEMATIC WAY, IT BLOCKS CROATIA\'S INTEGRATION 
INTO EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS.

7.  (C) CROATIA HAS BEEN A SOLID ALLY IN THE WAR ON 
TERRORISM, AND HAS MADE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS.  CROATIA\'S 
ONLY MILITARY UNIT CERTIFIED AS NATO-INTEROPERABLE (AN MP 
PLATOON) IS NOW DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN.  CROATIA REFUSED TO 
BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COALITION ON IRAQ, PREFERRING TO SCORE 
POINTS WITH THE FRENCH TO SUPPORT ITS EU MEMBERSHIP BID. 
CROATIA HAS OFFERED IN-KIND ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ AND IS 
CONSIDERING OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT THIS IS AN ELECTION 
YEAR, AND THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN WILLING TO SWIM 
THE TIDE AGAINST PUBLIC OPINION TO SUPPORT OUR APPROACH. 
OFFICIALS SEEK TO KEEP CROATIA\'S COOPERATION ON TERRORISM 
DISTINCT FROM ITS RESISTANCE ON IRAQ. 
 
POINT TO MAKE 
 
- WE APPRECIATE CROATIA\'S IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WAR 
ON TERRORISM.  WE HOPE CROATIA WILL RESPOND POSITIVELY TO 
CONCRETE REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT TO ACTIVITIES IN IRAQ.

PROGRESS TOWARD MEMBERSHIP IN NATO 
---------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE THE CURRENT COALITION 
DEFEATED THE NATIONALIST REGIME LED BY TUDJMAN\'S HDZ, 
CROATIA\'S STATUS CHANGED FROM BEING OUTSIDE PFP TO THAT OF 
SERIOUS ASPIRANT IN NATO\'S MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLAN.  PROGRESS 
HAS BEEN UNEVEN AND, IN SOME AREAS, DISAPPOINTING.  AT 
CROATIA\'S FIRST FORMAL MAP REVIEW IN BRUSSELS ON MAY 8, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

POINT TO MAKE: 
 
- COMMEND YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S PROGRESS AND REITERATE USG 
COMMITMENT TO NATO\'S OPEN DOOR.  URGE YOU TO MAKE PROGRESS ON 
KEY REFORM AREAS -- MOST OF NATO\'S BENCHMARKS WILL HELP YOU 
PROGRESS TOWARD MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU AS WELL.

SUBJECT: CROATIAN GRUMBLING ABOUT TIRANA VENUE FOR ADRIATIC 
CHARTER SIGNING 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE ROSSIN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) THE DECISION TO SIGN THE ADRIATIC CHARTER IN TIRANA, 
AND NOT IN WASHINGTON, LED TO GRUMBLING IN THE CROATIAN 
FOREIGN MINISTRY AND SPECULATION IN THE PRESS HERE THAT 
CROATIA WAS BEING PUNISHED FOR ITS REFUSAL TO SUPPORT OUR 
APPROACH ON IRAQ.  THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SOUGHT -- WITH NO 
SUCCESS -- TO CONVINCE OTHER A3 COUNTRIES TO PUSH FOR A 
CHANGE IN VENUE BACK TO WASHINGTON, EVEN IF IT WOULD HAVE 
MEANT A DELAY.  PICULA WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A HIGH-PROFILE 
SIGNING IN WASHINGTON, WITH BILATERAL MEETINGS BEFORE AND 
AFTER, TO VALIDATE THE GOC\'S PROGRESS TOWARD MEMBERSHIP IN 
NATO AS THE COALITION ENTERS AN ELECTION SEASON.  THE CHOICE 
OF TIRANA AS A VENUE WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE THINGS ALBANIA 
IS DOING AND CROATIA IS NOT, LIKE SIGNING AN ARTICLE 98 
AGREEMENT AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO EFFORTS IN 
IRAQ. 
 
2.  (C) THE CROATIAN PRESS, SPURRED ON BY MALICIOUS LEAKS 
FROM THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, IS SPECULATING THAT THE U.S. CHOSE 
TIRANA FOR THE SIGNING IN ORDER TO PUNISH THE RACAN 
GOVERNMENT.  POLITICAL COMMENTATORS CLAIM THAT THE U.S. 
DECISION WAS PREDICATED BY CROATIA\'S REFUSAL TO BE NAMED AS A 
MEMBER OF THE COALITION OF THE WILLING, BY CROATIA\'S REFUSAL 
TO GRANT OVERFLIGHT CLEARANCE FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT BOUND FOR 
IRAQ, AND ALSO IN RESPONSE TO DEROGATORY REMARKS ABOUT 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING THE U.S. 
AMBASSADOR) MADE RECENTLY BY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GORAN 
GRANIC. 
 
    3.  (C) THE GOC IS DOING ITS BEST TO TURN OFF SPECULATION 
THAT THE TIRANA VENUE WAS CHOSEN AS \"PUNISHMENT\" FOR CROATIA. 
 CROATIA\'S MAP COORDINATOR EXPLAINED TO THE PRESS THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF SECRETARY POWELL\'S PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO THE 
CHARTER AND POINTED OUT HOW DIFFICULT IT HAS BEEN FOR THE 
SECRETARY TO FIND A TIME -- IN THE MIDDLE OF A KEY TRIP TO 
 
SIPDIS 
THE MIDEAST -- TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT.  ANALYSTS BOTH IN AND 
OUT OF GOVERNMENT WILL PROBABLY NOT BE CONVINCED.  FOR MANY 
OF THEM, CROATIA IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE, AND EVERY 
WORLD EVENT WHICH AFFECTS CROATIA MUST HAVE SOMEHOW BEEN 
BROUGHT ABOUT BY CROATIA\'S OWN ACTION.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR, ICTY, War Crimes 
SUBJECT:  INDICTED FORMER CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF JANKO BOBETKO BURIED 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: INDICTED GENERAL JANKO BOBETKO WAS BURIED ON 
MAY 2.  WHILE OPPOSITION LEADERS ATTENDED THE FUNERAL, 
PRESIDENT MESIC DID NOT, AND PM RACAN AND SPEAKER TOMCIC 
ONLY PAID THEIR TRIBUTE AT A SEPARATE CEREMONY.  IN AN 
INFLAMMATORY SPEECH AT THE FUNERAL, RETIRED GENERAL IVAN 
BASARAC CRITICIZED BOBETKO\'S INDICTMENT BY THE ICTY, SAYING 
THERE WAS NO FREEDOM IN CROATIA AS LONG AS INDICTED 
GENERALS ARE NOT FREE.  MOST MEDIA CRITICIZED BASARIC\'S 
    TURNING THE FUNERAL INTO A POLITICAL RALLY.  SOME ARGUED 
THAT PART OF THE PUBLIC WOULD OBJECT TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
LOW PROFILE AT BOBETKO\'S FUNERAL, WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY WOULD DISAPPROVE OF ITS TAKING ANY PART AT ALL. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  RETIRED GENERAL JANKO BOBETKO, FORMER CROATIAN CHIEF OF 
THE GENERAL STAFF, WHO WAS ALSO INDICTED FOR WAR CRIMES BY 
THE ICTY, WAS BURIED ON MAY 2 IN HIS NATIVE TOWN OF SISAK. 
THE PRESS ESTIMATED THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN 10 AND 20 
THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHERED AT HIS FUNERAL, MANY OF WHOM HAD 
ARRIVED FROM THE SOUTHERN COASTAL REGION OF DALMATIA. 
WHILE MOST OPPOSITION LEADERS, INCLUDING HDZ PRESIDENT IVO 
SANADER, ATTENDED THE FUNERAL, THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
REPRESENTED ONLY SYMBOLICALLY BY ONE MINISTER (SDP) AND ONE 
MP (HSS) WHO WERE THERE IN THEIR PARTY AND PRIVATE 
CAPACITIES.  PRESIDENT STIPE MESIC SENT HIS AIDE-DE-CAMP TO 
REPRESENT HIM AT BOBETKO\'S FUNERAL AND EXCUSED HIMSELF, 
CITING PRIOR ENGAGEMENTS.  PRIME MINISTER IVICA RACAN AND 
PARLIAMENT SPEAKER ZLATKO TOMCIC ATTENDED A MEMORIAL 
SERVICE IN ZAGREB, BUT DID NOT GO TO SISAK FOR THE FUNERAL 
ITSELF. 
 
3.  AS EXPECTED, BOBETKO\'S FUNERAL TURNED INTO A POLITICAL 
EVENT; IN A PARAPHRASE OF THE GENERAL\'S MEMOIRS, A LOCAL 
COLUMNIST DESCRIBED THE FUNERAL AS BOBETKO\'S \"LAST, 
DECISIVE BATTLE WITH THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL.\"  RETIRED GENERAL 
BASARAC MADE AN INFLAMMATORY SPEECH IN WHICH HE SAID THERE 
WAS \"NO FREEDOM IN CROATIA AS LONG AS GENERALS NORAC, 
GOTOVINA AND ADEMI ARE NOT FREE,\" DISMISSING THE INDICTMENT 
    AGAINST BOBETKO AS BASELESS.  WHILE BASARAC DREW A PARALLEL 
BETWEEN THE PROSECUTION OF BOBETKO AND THE \"PERSECUTION OF 
CHRIST,\" ONE BANNER AT THE FUNERAL READ: \"HOLY TRINITY: 
FRANJO, JANKO AND GOJKO,\" IN REFERENCE TO LATE PRESIDENT 
TUDJMAN, BOBETKO AND LATE MINISTER OF DEFENSE SUSAK. 
SIMILARLY, HDZ PRESIDENT IVO SANADER DESCRIBED BOBETKO AS A 
\"LEGEND OF THE CROATIAN STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM AND 
INDEPENDENCE, WHOSE NOBLE DEED WAS WITHOUT A SINGLE STAIN.\" 
SHORTLY BEFORE HE DIED, BOBETKO SAID HE WANTED CONVICTED 
WAR CRIMINAL GENERAL MIRKO NORAC TO BE RELEASED FROM JAIL 
TO CARRY THE CROSS AT THE FUNERAL.  AUTHORITIES DEMURRED. 
 
4.  MOST MEDIA CRITICIZED THE POLITICIZATION OF BOBETKO\'S 
FUNERAL, ESPECIALLY BASARAC\'S SPEECH.  COMMENTATORS 
CRITICIZED THE FACT THAT THE FUNERAL WAS DESIGNED AND USED 
AS A FORUM FOR A POLITICAL SHOWDOWN WITH THE GOVERNMENT. 
SOME IN THE MEDIA NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE STATE LEADERSHIP 
WAS IN A NO-WIN SITUATION.  THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT AND 
THE PRIME MINISTER FAILED TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL WILL BE 
USED BY CROATIA\'S NATIONALIST RIGHT-WING TO SKEWER THE 
RULING COALITION.  THE FACT THAT THEY PARTICIPATED AT ALL 
-- IN THIS CASE BY THE PRIME MINISTER DISPATCHING A MEMBER 
OF PARLIAMENT AND OF THE GOVERNMENT -- MAY DRAW CRITICISM 
FROM THE HAGUE AND OTHERS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) IN DECEMBER 2002, THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT PASSED A 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00995  01 OF 03  061502Z 
NEW \"CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES.\"  THAT LAW 
WAS WIDELY HAILED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A 
REASONABLE COMPROMISE AND A STEP FORWARD FOR MINORITY RIGHTS 
IN CROATIA.  BUT THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SLOW TO 
IMPLEMENT IT, AND CAME UNDER FIRE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY FOR ITS DELAY.  THE LAW CALLS FOR BROAD PROTECTIONS 
OF MINORITY RIGHTS, INCREASED LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION AND 
THE CREATION OF NEW LOCAL- AND NATIONAL- LEVEL \"MINORITY 
COUNCILS.\"  THESE NEW COUNCILS WILL BE STATE-FUNDED AND, 
WHILE THEY HAVE LITTLE DIRECT POLICY RESPONSIBILITIES, ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE INFLUENTIAL IN DIRECTING STATE RESOURCES AND 
IN SELECTING MINORITY CANDIDATES FOR LOCAL BY-ELECTIONS. 
 
2.  (C) ON APRIL 10, THE RACAN CABINET LURCHED INTO ACTION 
AND ANNOUNCED THAT ELECTIONS FOR LOCAL MINORITY COUNCILS 
WOULD TAKE PLACE ON MAY 18.  MINORITY GROUPS COMPLAIN THAT 
THE WARNING TIME IS TOO SHORT AND THAT BUREAUCRATIC SNAFUS 
ARE PREVENTING REGISTRATION OF CANDIDATES.  THE LEADER OF THE 
CROATIA\'S ETHNIC ITALIAN MINORITY HAS CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT. 
THE OSCE MISSION IN CROATIA -- PERHAPS REFLEXIVELY -- HAS 
JOINED WITH THE MINORITIES IN OBJECTING TO THE SHORT NOTICE, 
BUT HAS ALSO CALLED ON ALL MINORITY GROUPS TO TAKE PART IN 
THE ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NEW \"CONSTITUTIONAL LAW\" ON MINORITIES ... 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) CROATIA\'S NEW \"CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL 
MINORITIES\" (CLNM) WAS PASSED ON DECEMBER 13 (REFTEL) AFTER A 
DIVISIVE DEBATE FINALLY PRODUCED A COMPROMISE WITH WHICH 
MINORITY GROUPS, THE OPPOSITION AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00995  01 OF 03  061502Z 
COMMUNITY DECLARED THEY COULD ALL LIVE.  WHILE MINORITY 
GROUPS DID NOT GET EVERYTHING THEY WANTED, GUARANTEED 
MINORITY REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT WAS INCREASED, AND THE 
LAW IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS A STEP FORWARD FOR MINORITY 
RIGHTS. 
 
ESTABLISHES \"MINORITY COUNCILS\" 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) THE CLNM CALLS FOR THE ELECTION OF NEW MINORITY 
COUNCILS AT THE COMMUNITY, CITY AND COUNTY LEVEL.  IN UNITS 
OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT (CITIES AND TOWNS), EACH ETHNIC 
MINORITY COMMUNITY WHICH HAS MORE THAN 200 INDIVIDUALS AND 
MAKES UP AT LEAST 1.5 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION MAY 
ELECT A MINORITY COUNCIL.  (A SINGLE TOWN WITH MORE THAN ONE 
SIGNIFICANT MINORITY COMMUNITY COULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE 
MINORITY COUNCIL.)  IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL MINORITY 
COUNCILS, THE CLNM CREATED A NATIONAL-LEVEL COUNCIL MADE UP 
OF FIVE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT, SEVEN ELECTED BY 
THE LOCAL-LEVEL COUNCILS PLUS ALL OF THE DESIGNATED MINORITY 
REPRESENTATIVES IN PARLIAMENT. 
 
5.  (SBU) IN MOST OF THEIR FUNCTIONS, MUNICIPAL MINORITY 
COUNCILS ARE EXPECTED TO ACT AS LOCAL-LEVEL WATCHDOGS FOR THE 
RIGHTS OF THE COMMUNITY THEY REPRESENT.  COUNCILS ARE 
EMPOWERED TO PROPOSE LOCAL LEGISLATION WITH THE AIM OF 
ADVANCING THE GOALS OF THE MINORITY THEY REPRESENT.  THEY MAY 
ALSO REVIEW DECISIONS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODY AND, IF 
THEY BELIEVE A DECISION UNFAIRLY DISADVANTAGES MINORITIES, 
THEY MAY APPEAL IT DIRECTLY TO THE APPROPRIATE MINISTRY IN 
ZAGREB, WHICH MUST IN TURN ANNUL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00995  01 OF 03  061502Z 
DECISION WITHIN EIGHT DAYS IF IT AGREES WITH THE LOCAL 
COUNCIL.  WHILE THE LAW DOES NOT IMPOSE QUOTAS FOR MINORITY 
REPRESENTATION IN CITY OFFICES, COUNCILS HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
\"PROPOSE CANDIDATES FOR DUTIES IN STATE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES 
AND BODIES OF SELF-GOVERNMENT UNITS.\" 
 
6.  (SBU) THE CLNM INSTRUCTS MUNICIPALITIES TO ALLOCATE FUNDS 
TO COVER THE ACTIVITIES OF LOCAL COUNCILS.  COUNCILS HAVE THE 
SAME STATUS AS NGOS AND ARE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY THE NEW 
LAW TO USE FUNDS FROM PRIVATE DONATIONS, EVEN IF THEY ARE 
FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. 
 
ELECTIONS FOR MINORITY COUNCILS ON MAY 18 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) COUNCILS WILL BE ELECTED BY THE SAME RULES WHICH 
APPLY FOR ELECTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES.  ACCORDING TO 
THESE RULES, THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF ELECTIONS MUST TAKE PLACE 
NOT LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS BUT NOT MORE THAN SIXTY DAYS BEFORE 
THE ELECTION.  PM RACAN\'S CABINET SET THE MAY 18 DATE FOR 
ELECTIONS TO THE MINORITY COUNCILS AT ITS CLOSED SESSION ON 
APRIL 10.  THE DECISION BECAME FINAL ON APRIL 16, THE DATE OF 
ITS PUBLICATION IN CROATIA\'S OFFICIAL GAZETTE.

8.  (C) MINORITY LEADERS OBJECT TO THE SHORT NOTICE OF THE 
ELECTIONS, BUT MOST HAVE BEGUN PREPARATIONS TO ENSURE THEIR 
ORGANIZATIONS ARE REPRESENTED.  SERB LEADER MILORAD PUPOVAC 
COMPLAINED THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PUBLISHED RIGHT BEFORE 
THE EASTER SEASON, WHICH MEANT THAT MANY OF THE BUREAUCRATS 
WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUING ELECTION MATERIALS WERE INSTEAD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

STRETCHING LONG WEEKENDS INTO HOLIDAYS.  FULLY 237 
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH MINORITY POPULATION 
TO ELECT MINORITY COUNCILS, EACH OF WHICH CAN HAVE FROM 10 - 
15 MEMBERS (DEPENDING WHETHER IT IS A CITY/TOWN COUNCIL OR A 
COUNTY COUNCIL), PUPOVAC EXPLAINED, AND IT IS A MONUMENTAL 
TASK TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATES, PROVIDE THEM WITH REGISTRATION 
FORMS, ENSURE THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER NOMINATION 
SIGNATURES AND THEN PAY THE FEE (ABOUT USD 7.00). 
 
9.  (C) PUPOVAC ADMITTED HE WAS CONCERNED THAT NATIONAL-LEVEL 
ETHNIC POLITICAL PARTIES, LIKE HIS INDEPENDENT SERBIAN 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDSS), WOULD LOSE INFLUENCE IF THEY COULD 
NOT REACH OUT TO ENOUGH LOCAL-LEVEL CANDIDATES IN TIME TO 
SEAT A RESPECTABLE NUMBER OF LOCAL COUNCILORS.  PUPOVAC 
SPECULATED THAT WHILE THE COUNCILS HAVE NO FORMAL ROLE IN 
SELECTING CANDIDATES FOR LOCAL-LEVEL BY-ELECTIONS (REQUIRED 
TO ENSURE PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION BY MINORITIES IN LOCAL 
COUNCILS), HE WAS SURE THAT THE COUNCILS WOULD BE INFLUENTIAL 
IN THAT PROCESS. 
 
10.  (C) ETHNIC HUNGARIAN LEADER TIBOR SANTO, WHO HOLDS ONE 
OF FIVE SEATS IN PARLIAMENT DESIGNATED FOR CROATIA\'S ETHNIC 
MINORITIES, AGREED THAT THE DEADLINE IS SHORT, BUT SAID THAT 
HE EXPECTED ETHNIC HUNGARIANS TO FIELD LISTS OF CANDIDATES IN 
ALL OF THE TWO DOZEN MUNICIPALITIES WHERE HUNGARIANS MAKE UP 
ENOUGH OF THE POPULATION TO QUALIFY TO FORM MINORITY 
COUNCILS.  HE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT ACTED 
INAPPROPRIATELY IN SETTING THE MAY 18 ELECTION DATE. 
 
CALL FOR ITALIANS TO BOYCOTT COUNCIL ELECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00995  02 OF 03  061502Z 
 
11.  (C) FURIO RADIN, THE MP REPRESENTING CROATIA\'S ITALIAN 
MINORITY IN PARLIAMENT, INSISTS THAT THE MAY 18 DEADLINE IS 
FAR TOO SHORT AND HAS CALLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SET 
ANOTHER DATE FAR IN THE FUTURE.  HE PUBLICLY CALLED ON ETHNIC 
ITALIANS TO BOYCOTT THE ELECTION AND SAID THAT CROATIA\'S 
ITALIAN UNION (AN ISTRIA-BASED ETHNIC POLITICAL GROUPING) 
WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN DRAFTING LISTS OF CANDIDATES.  RADIN 
TOLD OSCE PRIVATELY THAT THE DEADLINES ARE \"IMPOSSIBLE TO 
MEET\" AND SPECULATED THAT THE MAY 18 DATE WAS \"EITHER A 
RESULT OF UTTER INCOMPETENCE OR A CLEAR WISH ON THE PART OF 
THE GOVERNMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MINORITIES WERE WEAK AND 
INCAPABLE.\"  RADIN POINTED OUT TO THE OSCE THAT THE ELECTION 
RULES STATE THAT CANDIDATE LISTS MUST BE COMPLETED AND 
SUBMITTED WITHIN TWELVE DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
ELECTIONS.  BECAUSE OF THE EASTER HOLIDAY, THIS PERIOD WAS 
SHORTENED FURTHER. 
 
IS RADIN JUST PROTECTING HIS INTERESTS? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) OTHER ETHNIC LEADERS WERE SURPRISED BY RADIN\'S 
VEHEMENCE AND, WHILE THEY RESPECT THE STRONG STANCE TAKEN BY 
THE ITALIANS, THEY WONDER IF THE BOYCOTT TACTIC IS 
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.  SERB LEADER PUPOVAC SPECULATED TO US THAT 
ONE REASON THE ITALIANS MAY OBJECT TO THE NEW MINORITY ORDER 
IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN A PEG.  BEFORE PASSAGE 
OF THE NEW CLNM, BOSNIAKS WERE NOT IDENTIFIED AS AN ETHNIC 
MINORITY.   NOW (USING DATA FROM THE MOST RECENT CENSUS), 
BOSNIAKS ARE THE SECOND MOST NUMEROUS \"NATIONAL MINORITY\" IN 
CROATIA, WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL GET A LARGER SLICE OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00995  02 OF 03  061502Z 
STATE FUNDING THAN THE ITALIANS WILL. 
 
13.  (C) HUNGARIAN MP SANTO TOLD US THAT RADIN IS MOST LIKELY 
CONCERNED THAT THE NEW MINORITY COUNCILS WILL DISPLACE THE 
ITALIAN UNION.  AS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION, ONLY UNION 
MEMBERS ELECT THEIR OFFICERS.  CROATIA\'S ITALIAN UNION IS 
EXPRESSLY NAMED IN BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
OF ITALY AS THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR ETHNIC ITALIANS IN 
CROATIA.  SANTO SPECULATED THAT IF ELECTIONS FOR THE NEW 
COUNCILS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE ITALIAN UNION\'S STATUS WILL 
DECREASE.  HE SAID THAT THE MINORITY COUNCILS WERE NOT 
INTENDED TO BE AN EXTENSION OF NATIONAL-LEVEL ETHNIC 
POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THEY WERE INTENDED RATHER TO 
EMPOWER A GROUP OF LOCAL MINORITIES TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND 
MINORITY ISSUES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. 
 
14.  (C) MATO ARLOVIC, CHAIR OF THE PARLIAMENT\'S 
CONSTITUTION, RULES AND POLITICAL SYSTEM COMMITTEE (WHICH 
DRAFTED THE CLNM) TOLD US THAT RADIN\'S RESISTANCE IS ALL 
ABOUT MONEY.  ACCORDING TO ONE PRESS ARTICLE, THE ITALIAN 
GOVERNMENT IS FUNDING THE ITALIAN UNION TO THE TUNE OF ALMOST 
3.5 MILLION EURO IN 2003.  A MINORITY COUNCIL WHICH 
REPRESENTES THE BROADER ETHNIC ITALIAN COMMUNITY IN CROATIA 
MIGHT AT SOME POINT COMPETE FOR THIS FUNDING.

PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00995  03 OF 03  061503Z 
WHETHER RADIN IS RIGHT AND WHETHER THE GOC HAS ENGINEERED 
THIS PROCESS TO FAIL.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GORAN GRANIC HAS 
BEEN TASKED BY THE CABINET WITH IMPLEMENTING THE CLNM -- 
GRANIC HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY OBSTRUCTIONIST TO INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY EFFORTS ON REFUGEE RETURNS AND WAR CRIMES. 
 
16.  (C) PUPOVAC ADMITS THAT THE ACRIMONIOUS DEBATE BEFORE 
PASSAGE OF THE CLNM MAY HAVE MADE SOME LEADING COALITION 
FIGURES -- INCLUDING DPM GRANIC -- LESS EAGER TO REACH OUT TO 
POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE MINORITY COMMUNITY.  PUPOVAC SAID HE 
MET WITH GRANIC JUST AFTER THE APRIL 10 CABINET MEETING WHEN 
THE DATE FOR COUNCIL ELECTIONS HAD BEEN SET (BUT BEFORE 
PUBLICATION), BUT THE DPM MADE NO MENTION OF THE MAY 18 DATE.

ADMITTED THAT THE GOC ACTIONS HAVE BEEN LEGAL, BUT ADDED THAT 
HE THINKS THIS \"OMISSION\" COMBINED WITH THE DECISION TO 
SCHEDULE ELECTIONS AT THIRTY-TWO DAYS AFTER ANNOUNCING 
ELECTIONS (RATHER THAN CLOSER TO 60 DAYS) SHOWS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT THESE ELECTIONS TO BE A SUCCESS. 
 
GOC EXTENDS DEADLINE TO VERIFY VOTER ROLLS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
17.  (C) THERE ARE SOME RECENT SIGNS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
RESPONDING TO PRESSURE TO MAKE THE ELECTIONS A SUCCESS.  MANY 
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ALREADY PUBLISHED CANDIDATE LISTS.  ON 
MAY 5, THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED AN EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE 
FOR MINORITIES TO CHECK VOTER REGISTRATION LISTS TO ENSURE 
ALL ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO CAST BALLOTS. 
PUPOVAC WELCOMED THE EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE, BUT IT WAS 
NOT ENOUGH FOR RADIN; HE TOLD US ON MAY 6 THAT THE ITALIANS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00995  03 OF 03  061503Z 
STILL PLAN TO BOYCOTT THE ELECTION AND PLANS TO SEEK A NEW 
DATE FOR ITALIAN ELECTIONS.  (WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOYCOTT 
IS NOT TOTAL; SOME ETHNIC ITALIAN COMMUNITIES HAVE PROPOSED 
CANDIDATE LISTS OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF THE ITALIAN UNION.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
18. (C) THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS BEEN PUSHING THE GOC 
TO MOVE FORWARD ON IMPLEMENTING THE CLNM SINCE IT WAS PASSED, 
AND THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES HERE HAVE CHEERED US ON.  NOW 
THAT THE GOC IS MOVING FORWARD, THE MINORITIES ARE CRYING 
\"FOUL\" AND ARE ASKING FOR A DELAY IN THIS ELECTION.  THIS 
ELECTION SHOULD NOT HAVE COME AS A SURPRISE TO ANYONE IN THE 
MINORITY COMMUNITY, LEAST OF ALL TO RADIN.  HE HELPED DRAFT 
THE CLNM AND KNOWS THE DEADLINES AND TIME LIMITS IN THE 
ELECTION RULES.  WE THINK THE OSCE\'S CURRENT PUBLIC LINE IS 
RIGHT ON THE MONEY: KEEP THE PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO COMMIT 
RESOURCES AND SHOW FLEXIBILITY AS THE ELECTION APPROACHES 
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ENCOURAGING MINORITIES TO PARTICIPATE.

SUBJECT: USG-AMWAY CORPORATION JOIN TO CLEAR MINEFIELD NEAR 
SPLIT 
 
 
1. TO HIGHLIGHT A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE USG AND AMWAY 
CORPORATION IN CROATIA TO CLEAR A MINEFIELD NEAR A PRIMARY 
SCHOOL IN THE TOWN OF ZRNOVNICA NEAR SPLIT, THE AMBASSADOR 
ATTENDED A CEREMONY AT THE SCHOOL ON MAY 5.  SENIOR AMWAY 
REPRESENTATIVES, THE MAYOR OF SPLIT, AND CROATIAN MINE ACTION 
    CENTER (CROMAC) AND INTERNATIONAL TRUST FUND (ITF) OFFICIALS 
WERE IN ATTENDANCE AT THE EVENT, WHICH RECEIVED WIDESPREAD 
MEDIA PUBLICITY.  AMWAY CORPORATION IN CROATIA INITIALLY 
RAISED USD 15,000 FROM ITS DISTRIBUTORS IN CROATIA AND ASKED 
IF THE USG WOULD MATCH THAT AMOUNT THROUGH ITS MATCHING FUNDS 
PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE ITF IN SLOVENIA, AND ALSO ASSIST 
WITH FINDING A PROSPECTIVE DEMINING PROJECT. 
 
2. AFTER DISCOVERING THAT THE SELECTED PROJECT WOULD COST 
MORE THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED BECAUSE OF AN INCREASE IN ITS 
OVERALL SIZE, THE AMBASSADOR, WITH THE SUPPORT OF PM,S 
OFFICE OF HUMANITARIAN DEMINING, AGREED TO COVER THE 
DIFFERENCE.  THE AMBASSADOR AND AMWAY OFFICIALS PRESENTED A 
CHECK TO GOC DEMINING OFFICIALS IN THE AMOUNT OF USD 120,000 
TO COVER THE COST OF THE PROJECT.  DEMINING OPERATIONS WILL 
BEGIN WHEN THE SCHOOL YEAR ENDS NEXT MONTH AND WILL BE 
COMPLETED BY AUGUST. 
 
3. THE AMBASSADOR, AMWAY OFFICIALS, AND THE MAYOR WERE 
WELCOMED TO THE SCHOOL BY THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE FROM ITS 400 
STUDENTS AS A SHOW OF THEIR APPRECIATION FOR THEIR 
WILLINGNESS TO FINANCE CLEARING A MINEFIELD LITERALLY TEN 
YARDS FROM THEIR SCHOOL.  THE CHILDREN PERFORMED SONGS AND 
DANCES AND EXPRESSED THEIR APPRECIATION TO THE USG AND AMWAY 
CORPORATION.  DURING HIS SPEECH, THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED 
THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE JOINT PROJECT WITH AMWAY IS TO 
CONTINUE TO PROMOTE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN THE FIELD 
OF DEMINING.  HE URGED OTHER COMPANIES IN CROATIA TO FOLLOW 
AMWAY,S LEAD BY DONATING OR RAISING FUNDS.  THE AMBASSADOR 
ALSO PRESENTED OVER 200 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE CHILDREN,S BOOKS 
THAT HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY THE PRINCIPAL FOR THE SCHOOL,S 
    LIBRARY.  THE DONATION OF THE BOOKS, AND EVENTUALLY A 
COMPUTER, WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY PM,S OFFICE OF HUMANITARIAN 
DEMINING. 
 
4. THE AMBASSADOR THANKED ALL OF THOSE WHO HAD MADE THE EVENT 
POSSIBLE, NOTING THAT THE DEMINED AREA WILL BENEFIT THE 
ENTIRE COMMUNITY BY REMOVING CONCERNS OVER THE SAFETY OF THE 
CHILDREN ATTENDING THE SCHOOL.  DESPITE THE USG,S 
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION, THE AMBASSADOR MADE IT 
CLEAR DURING PRESS INTERVIEWS THAT THIS WAS AMWAY,S EVENT 
AND ITS OPPORTUNITY TO &BASK IN THE SUN8 FOR ITS EFFORTS. 
AMWAY IN TURN INFORMED US IT IS ALREADY BUDGETING FOR FURTHER 
MINE ACTION NEXT YEAR.

CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC OFFICER ISABELLA DETWILER: REASON 1.5 (B AND D) 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
1.  (C) AT A CLOSED SESSION ON MAY 8, THE CROATIAN 
CABINET FORMALLY DECIDED TO ACCEPT FUNDS FROZEN IN THE 
U.S. UNDER MILOSEVIC-ERA SANCTIONS.  ON MAY 7 
WE MET WITH MFA SENIOR LEGAL ADVISOR ANDREJA METELKO- 
ZGOMBIC AND AMERICA\'S DESK DIRECTOR MIROSLAV KOVACIC TO 
PRESS FOR CROATIAN ACCEPTANCE.  THIS ISSUE WAS ALSO 
RAISED DURING THE SECRETARY\'S MEETING WITH FM PICULA ON 
THE MARGINS OF THE SIGNING OF THE ADRIATIC CHARTER ON MAY 
2. 
 
2.  (SBU) ON MAY 9 WE CONFIRMED WITH METELKO-ZGOMBIC THAT 
THE CABINET HAD DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE FUNDS, WHILE NOT 
PREJUDICING THE PARLIAMENT\'S DECISION ON WHETHER TO 
RATIFY THE AGREEMENT ON SUCCESSION ISSUES (ASI).  IN 
COMMENTS TO THE PRESS AFTER THE CABINET SESSION, 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ALSO ANNOUNCED IT WOULD SEEK LEGAL 
ACTION AGAINST ONE OF THE JOINT VENTURE BANKS IN GERMANY, 
WHERE DEPOSITS MYSTERIOUSLY ERODED.  METELKO-ZGOMBIC 
STATED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE LEGAL ACTION WOULD BE TO 
TRY TO FORCE DISCLOSURE OF THE HISTORY OF THE ACCOUNTS, 
THOUGH IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOME SORT OF RESTITUTION 
MIGHT BE SOUGHT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (SBU) ON MAY 8, IN A CLOSED CABINET SESSION, THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01031  01 OF 02  091345Z 
GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE APPROXIMATELY $56 
MILLION TRANSFER FROM THE USG.  DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
IVAN SIMONOVIC WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
WAS MIXING \"PRINCIPLES WITH PRAGMATISM,\" STRESSING THAT 
ACCEPTING THE MONEY DID NOT MEAN THAT CROATIA WOULD 
RATIFY THE ASI.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE 
DECISION TO FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE LHB BANK IN 
GERMANY, APPARENTLY PARTIALLY OWNED BY SLOVENIA\'S 
LJUBLJANSKA BANKA.  IN RESPONSE TO OUR QUERY, METELKO- 
ZGOMBIC CLARIFIED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE LAWSUIT WOULD 
BE TO EXTRACT INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISAPPEARING 
DEPOSITS, THOUGH SHE DID NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SEEKING SOME SORT OF COMPENSATION FROM THE BANK. 
 
4.  (SBU) THE DAY BEFORE THE DECISION, WE MET WITH MFA 
SENIOR LEGAL ADVISOR ANDREJA METELKO-ZGOMBIC AND 
AMERICA\'S DESK DIRECTOR MIROSLAV KOVACIC TO PRESS FOR 
CROATIAN ACCEPTANCE OF THE FUNDS FROZEN IN THE U.S. UNDER 
MILOSEVIC-ERA SANCTIONS.  WE STRESSED THAT WE SAW THE 
DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUNDS IN THE U.S. AS SEPARATE FROM 
THE ISSUE OF THE ASI, ALTHOUGH RESOLUTION OF THE LATTER 
WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN CROATIA\'S INTEREST. 
 
5. (C) METELKO-ZGOMBIC ACKNOWLEDGED THE RESOLUTION OF 
SUCCESSION ISSUES WAS IN CROATIA\'S INTERESTS, BUT THE 
PUBLIC AND THE PARLIAMENT WERE DEMANDING ANSWERS.  SHE 
REJECTED THE ARGUMENT THAT \"EVERYONE IN VIENNA KNEW\" THAT 
THE NUMBERS IN THE ASI WERE NOTIONAL; WHILE ADMITTING THE 
LIMITS OF HER KNOWLEDGE OF BANKING, SHE INSISTED THAT 
\"ANY VILLAGE BANK\" COULD COME UP WITH A FIGURE FOR ITS 
DEPOSITS.  WHEN CROATIA WENT TO THE OVERSEAS JOINT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01031  01 OF 02  091345Z 
VENTURE BANKS TO ASK FOR AN ACCOUNTING, IT WAS REBUFFED 
AND SENT TO THE NATIONAL BANK OF YUGOSLAVIA.  METELKO- 
ZGOMBIC INSISTED THAT THE NBY WAS EVADING ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY, AS LAID OUT IN APPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX C OF 
THE ASI, TO FACILITATE THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION FROM 
THE JOINT VENTURE BANKS TO THE SUCCESSOR STATES.  WE 
WONDERED ALOUD WHETHER A FULL ACCOUNTING WOULD REALLY BE 
ENOUGH TO CONVINCE THE PARLIAMENT TO SWALLOW AND RATIFY; 
METELKO-ZGOMBIC RETORTED IT WAS THE LEAST THE GOVERNMENT 
COULD DO. 
 
6.  (C) TURNING TO THE DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS FROM THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK, METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID 
SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 
UNFREEZING OF THE FUNDS, AS WE HAD PROMISED TO DO, AND 
THE DECISION TO DIVIDE AND DISBURSE THE FUNDS, WHICH HAD 
COME AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE, AND THROUGH A RATHER UNUSUAL 
CHANNEL -- THE U.S. BANK COMMUNICATION TO THE CROATIAN 
NATIONAL BANK.  WE EMPHASIZED THAT THE USG HAD DECIDED 
THE QUICKEST AND MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO GET THE SUCCESSOR 
STATES BACK THEIR OWN MONEY, UN-ERODED BY LAWSUITS, WAS 
THROUGH THIS MECHANISM. 
 
7.  (C) WHILE REFUSING TO PREJUDGE THE FINAL GOVERNMENT 
DECISION, METELKO-ZGOMBIC SAID THE GOVERNMENT WOULD TRY 
TO FIND A WAY TO ACCEPT THE FUNDS WITHOUT PREJUDICING THE 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ICTY ZAGREB RESREP THOMAS OSORIO TOLD US MAY 5 THAT 
THE GOC HAS IMPROVED COOPERATION IN THE MONTH FOLLOWING THE 
VISIT OF OTP CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE TO ZAGREB.  THE GOC 
LARGELY HAS FULFILLED OUTSTANDING DOCUMENT REQUESTS AND 
APPEARED SOMEWHAT MORE PROACTIVE IN THE GOTOVINA CASE -- IT 
IS SET TO ISSUE A REWARD FOR HIS ARREST ON MAY 10.  THE IVICA 
RAJIC TRANSFER TO ICTY CUSTODY APPEARED TO BE MOVING AHEAD AS 
WELL AS THE GOC INVESTIGATION AGAINST THOSE THAT SHELTERED 
AND SUPPORTED HIM AND OTHER CROATIAN PIFWCS.  THE ONLY BLACK 
CLOUD FOR OSORIO WAS DEL PONTE\'S POOR HANDLING OF A ZAGREB 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS REQUEST FOR AN \"ICTY ISSUES CHECKLIST.\" 
DESPITE OSORIO\'S WARNINGS, DEL PONTE CIRCULATED A 
POORLY-CRAFTED DOCUMENT THAT -- IF LEAKED -- COULD CLOUD 
GOC-ICTY RELATIONS.  END SUMMARY 
 
IMPROVED COOPERATION 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) ON MAY 5, ICTY ZAGREB RESREP THOMAS OSORIO TOLD US 
THAT THE GOC -- FOR NOW -- HAS BEEN LIVING UP TO THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

COMMITMENTS PM RACAN MADE WHEN OTP CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE 
VISITED ZAGREB A MONTH EARLIER (REF B): 
 
-- THE OTP RECEIVED THE BULK OF THE RAW CENSUS DATA IT 
REQUESTED.  WHILE SOME DATA ARE MISSING, OSORIO -- AT THIS 
POINT -- CONSIDERS THIS TO BE A TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT ON THE 
PART OF THE GOC CENSUS BUREAU AND NOT A GOC ATTEMPT TO 
OBFUSCATE. 
 
-- THE OTP IS WORKING WITH STATE PROSECUTOR BAJIC TO DEVELOP 
THE EXACT LANGUAGE THAT HE WOULD USE TO OBTAIN CROATIAN COURT 
PERMISSION TO ACCESS PRIVREDNA BANKA RECORDS RELATED TO GOC 
FINANCING OF THE WAR IN BOSNIA. 
 
-- THE OTP RECEIVED OVER 1100 PAGES OF PERSONAL DOCUMENTS OF 
THE FORMER GOC MINISTER OF DEFENSE GOJKO SUSAK, A KEY OTP 
DOCUMENT REQUEST.  OTP INVESTIGATORS ARE CLOSELY ANALYZING 
THE FILES, WHICH COULD HAVE BEARING ON A WIDE RANGE OF ICTY 
CASES, INCLUDING THE BLASKIC APPEAL. 
 
-- THE OTP ALSO WAS GIVEN ACCESS TO THE MILITARY ARCHIVES OF 
THE SEVEN CROATIAN ARMY BRIGADES THAT OPERATED IN BOSNIA FROM 
1992 TO 1994. 
 
GOTOVINA 
-------- 
 
3. (C) OSORIO SAID THAT, IN EARLY MAY, THE HEAD OF THE GOC 
OFFICE FOR COOPERATION WITH ICTY REASSURED HIM THAT THE GOC 
DECISION TO ISSUE A REWARD FOR ICTY FUGITIVE ANTE GOTOVINA 
WAS IRONCLAD.  IN A MEETING WITH US ON MAY 8, DIRECTOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01037  01 OF 02  091539Z 
GENERAL OF POLICE RANKO OSTOJIC CONFIRMED THAT THE GOC WOULD 
ISSUE THE GOTOVINA REWARD ON MAY 10 IN THE AMOUNT OF 350,000 
KUNA (USD 55,000).  THAT AMOUNT, SAID OSTOJIC, IS AT LEAST 
SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER REWARD ISSUED IN CROATIAN 
HISTORY.  OSTOJIC ALSO TOLD US THAT POLICE IN THE ZADAR AREA 
-- CENTRAL DALMATIA -- HAVE BEEN GIVEN SPECIFIC ORDERS TO 
TAIL AND SURVEIL GOTOVINA FAMILY MEMBERS AND KNOWN 
SYMPATHIZERS. 
 
IVICA RAJIC 
----------- 
 
4. (C) ON APRIL 30, THE ZAGREB COUNTY COURT RULED THAT THE 
ICTY HAS JURISDICTION OVER IVICA RAJIC AND APPROVED HIS 
TRANSFER TO THE HAGUE.  RAJIC\'S LAWYERS APPEALED THE DECISION 
TO THE CROATIAN SUPREME COURT, BUT LEGAL EXPERTS TOLD US THE 
APPEAL HAS NO CHANCE OF PROSPERING.  RAJIC SHOULD BE IN ICTY 
CUSTODY NO LATER THAN THE END OF MAY. 
 
5. (C) OSORIO TOLD US THAT DEL PONTE, DURING HER MEETING WITH 
PM RACAN, MADE IT CLEAR THAT SHE WANTS ALL INFORMATION THAT 
THE GOC DEVELOPS ON HOW RAJIC LIVED FREELY (UNDER ALIAS) IN 
CROATIA FOR SEVEN YEARS AFTER HIS OTP INDICTMENT.  RACAN 
REPORTEDLY PROMISED HER THAT A \"FULL REPORT WOULD BE

6. (C) OSTOJIC AND BAJIC TOLD US THAT THE GOC STILL IS 
PIECING TOGETHER THE COMPLEX NETWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE 
FORMER HDZ GOVERNMENT THAT PROTECTED IVICA RAJIC AND OTHER 
ICTY PIFWCS.  THEY PLAN TO INDICT ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN THE 
ILLEGAL \"OPERATION HAAG,\" CODE NAME FOR PROGRAM THAT 
SHELTERED PIFWCS AND RAN INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS AGAINST 
ICTY, SFOR, AND OTHERS (REF A). 
 
7. (C) OSTOJIC TOLD US THAT THE EFFORT TO PROTECT RAJIC WAS 
MASTERFUL:  WHEN HIS SPECIAL POLICE UNIT BEGAN ITS 
INVESTIGATION IN MID-2002, THERE WAS NO RECORD IN THE GOC TO 
INDICATE THAT AN IVICA RAJIC OFFICIALLY EVER EXISTED IN 
CROATIA.  CRITICALLY, ALL COPIES OF RAJIC\'S FINGERPRINT FILES 
HAD BEEN DESTROYED.  OSTOJIC SAID THAT THE POLICE WERE ABLE 
TO GET A COPY OF RAJIC\'S FINGERPRINTS FROM BIH GOVERNMENT 
AUTHORITIES WITHOUT TIPPING THEIR HAND TO THE ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION.  WITHOUT THOSE PRINTS, THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY CONCLUSIVELY THE PIFWC, WHO, WHEN 
ARRESTED, WAS LIVING IN A SUBURB OF SPLIT UNDER THE NAME OF 
JAKOV KOVAC. 
 
CDP \"NON PAPER:\" GOOD IDEA, POOR EXECUTION 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. (C) OSORIO SAID THAT DEL PONTE\'S POOR HANDLING OF A 
REQUEST FROM THE ZAGREB DIPLOMATIC CORPS FOR A \"COOPERATION 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01037  02 OF 02  091539Z 
CHECK LIST\" MARRED WHAT OTHERWISE HAS BEEN A GOOD MONTH FOR 
GOC-ICTY COOPERATION.  (DURING HER VISIT TO ZAGREB, IC REPS 
REQUESTED THAT THE OTP GENERATE AN \"ISSUES CHECK LIST\" THAT 
THEY COULD USE WHEN ENGAGING THE GOC ON COOPERATION WITH ICTY 
(REF B)).  ON APRIL 24 OSORIO GAVE US AN ADVANCE COPY OF AN 
OTP \"NON-PAPER,\" SAYING THAT THIS WAS WHAT DEL PONTE PROPOSED 
DISTRIBUTING TO THE IC (DOCUMENT POUCHED TO S/WCI AND 
EUR/SCE). 
 
9. (C) WE TOLD OSORIO THAT WHILE THE IDEA OF A BASIC 
CHECKLIST HAD MERIT, THE OTP \"NON-PAPER\" WAS FAR TOO LONG, 
DENSE AND \"PREACHY.\"  WE SUGGESTED TO OSORIO THAT THE OTP\'S 
SUBMISSION SHOULD BE SHORTER AND STRICTLY FACTUAL, OUTLINING 
AREAS OF NON-COOPERATION AND WHAT THE GOC MUST DO TO MEET OTP 
REQUESTS. 
 
10. (C) OSORIO SAID HE SHARED OUR VIEW (AS DID THE LOCAL OSCE 
MISSION, WHICH ALSO WAS GIVEN AN ADVANCE COPY OF THE 
\"NON-PAPER\"), AND HELD OFF ON DELIVERING THE DOCUMENT TO THE 
LOCAL EU TROIKA, DESPITE EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS FROM DEL 
PONTE.  HE TOLD US THAT ON APRIL 29 HE CALLED DEL PONTE TO 
EXPRESS HIS RESERVATIONS.  HE SAID THAT SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
THE DOCUMENT WAS FLAWED, BUT ORDERED HIM TO GIVE IT TO THE 
ZAGREB EU TROIKA AND THE U.S. EMBASSY ANYWAY; SHE PERSONALLY 
HAD GIVEN THE DOCUMENT TO SOLANA, PATTEN AND PRODI THE 
PREVIOUS DAY DURING A VISIT TO BRUSSELS.  SHE TOLD OSORIO 
\"WE\'LL GET IT RIGHT NEXT TIME.\"  OSORIO SAID THAT HE WAS 
CONVINCED THAT THE GOC WOULD GET ITS HANDS ON THE DOCUMENT, 
WHICH IT WOULD LEAK TO THE PRESS -- AT A TIME OF ITS CHOOSING 
-- TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE OTP IS NOT SINCERE IN ITS EFFORTS 
TO BUILD A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOC

SUMMARY 
 
1. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ON MAY 12 PRESSED DEPUTY FOREIGN 
MINISTER IVAN SIMONOVIC TO CONCLUDE AN ARTICLE 98 OR OTHER 
NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT.  SHOULD CROATIA FAIL TO DO SO BY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

JULY 1 WHEN THE AMERICAN SERVICEMEMBERS PROTECTION ACT COMES 
INTO EFFECT, IT STANDS TO PUT AT RISK OVER USD 19 MILLION IN 
FMF AND IMET ASSISTANCE (FY00 TO FY03) KEY TO ITS NATO 
INTEGRATION ASPIRATIONS.  DFM SIMONOVIC SAID THAT ICTY 
LINKAGES DURING AN ELECTION YEAR -- PARTICULARLY WHEN NEW 
INDICTMENTS ARE EXPECTED -- AND THE GOC\'S DESIRE NOT TO GET 
OUT IN FRONT OF THE EU MADE NEGOTIATING AN AGREEMENT ALMOST 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE GOC. 
 
2. (C) SIMONOVIC ASKED IF WASHINGTON MIGHT GRANT CROATIA AN 
ASPA WAIVER -- EVEN FOR SIX MONTHS -- PARTICULARLY, HE 
CLAIMED, SINCE THE GOC WAS SET TO UNDERTAKE A NUMBER OF 
PROMISING, BUT POLITICALLY DIFFICULT, REFUGEE RETURN 
INITIATIVES.  WHILE THE AMBASSADOR URGED SIMONOVIC TO 
IMPLEMENT THE GOC\'S REFUGEE RETURN AGENDA (DESCRIBED SEPTEL), 
THERE COULD BE NO LINKAGE BETWEEN THOSE EFFORTS AND AN ASPA 
WAIVER.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THE GOC HAD TO FIND A 
WAY TO BALANCE ITS INTERESTS AND TO MANAGE LINKAGES TO ICTY. 
RESPONDING TO SIMONOVIC, THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT HE HAD NO 
INDICATION THAT THE EU WAS WORKING ON AN ARTICLE 98 
INITIATIVE FOR THESSALONIKI.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PRESSING THE GOC ON ARTICLE 98 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) THE AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY DCM AND POLOFF, CALLED 
ON DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER IVAN SIMONOVIC ON MAY 12 TO PRESS 
THE GOC TO CONCLUDE AN ARTICLE 98 OR NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT. 
 THE AMBASSADOR BRIEFED THE DFM ON PROGRESS TO DATE -- 34 
AGREEMENTS SIGNED AND SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS UNDERWAY WITH SOME 
OF CROATIA\'S NEIGHBORS.  TALKS WITH THE EU HAVE BEEN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01047  01 OF 02  121715Z 
FRUITFUL, BUT SCOPE OF COVERAGE ISSUES HAVE PREVENTED THE 
U.S. FROM REACHING AN EU-MODEL AGREEMENT. 
 
4. (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT PRIME MINISTER RACAN AND 
OTHER GOC OFFICIALS TOLD HIM IN 2002 THAT THEY WISHED TO 
REACH AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT, BUT THAT CROATIA DID NOT WANT 
TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE EU AND, THEREFORE, PREFERRED TO 
WAIT FOR AN EU-MODEL AGREEMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT 
WHAT WAS AN UNDERSTANDABLE POSITION LAST YEAR NOW MUST BE 
RECONSIDERED:  BECAUSE OF THE AMERICAN SERVICEMEMBERS 
PROTECTION ACT (ASPA), CROATIA PUTS AT RISK OVER USD 19 
MILLION IN FMF AND IMET ASSISTANCE FROM FY 00 THROUGH FY 03. 
CONSIDERING THE LIMITED SCOPE IN THE CROATIAN DEFENSE BUDGET 
FOR NEW ACQUISITIONS, THIS ASSISTANCE IS CRITICAL FOR KEEPING 
CROATIA\'S NATO INTEGRATION ASPIRATIONS ON TRACK.  NOBODY ELSE 
WAS GIVING THAT NEEDED SUPPORT. 
 
5. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ADDED THAT THE GOC NEEDED TO REALIZE 
THAT THE COUNTRIES THAT CROATIA IS LOOKING TO PAVE THE WAY 
FOR IT WITHIN THE EU ARE UNAFFECTED BY ASPA.  MANY ARE EXEMPT 
OF THE EFFECTS OF ASPA BECAUSE OF THEIR NATO MEMBERSHIP OR, 
LIKE AUSTRIA, DO NOT RECEIVE FMF OR IMET ASSISTANCE.  THE DFM 
AGREED THAT CROATIA WAS IN A DIFFICULT AND ISOLATED POSITION. 
 IT WAS AN \"UNPLEASANT FEELING\" TO BE A PRIMARY \"TARGET,\" 
ALBEIT INADVERTENTLY, OF THE ASPA.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE DFM 
SAID, THE GOC WAS HAMSTRUNG.  IN AN ELECTION YEAR, THE 
SPECTER OF NEW ICTY INDICTMENTS AND DOMESTIC LINKAGES BETWEEN 
THE ICC AND ICTY MAKE AN AGREEMENT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  THE 
TYPE OF AGREEMENT, BE IT THE STANDARD OR UNILATERAL ARTICLE 
98 AGREEMENT OR THE \"GENERIC\" NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT, DID 
NOT MATTER. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01047  01 OF 02  121715Z 
 
A SIX-MONTH WAIVER PLEASE 
------------------------- 
 
6. (C) SIMONOVIC LAUNCHED INTO A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A 
NUMBER OF NEW INITIATIVES -- LARGELY FOCUSED ON REFUGEE 
RETURN -- THAT HE SAID THE GOC PLANNED TO UNDERTAKE IN COMING 
MONTHS (SEPTEL).  THESE INITIATIVES, HE ARGUED, WERE 
IMPORTANT FOR CROATIA\'S EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP ASPIRATIONS 
AND FOR REGIONAL STABILITY, BUT HAD THEIR OWN POLITICAL COST 
FOR THE GOC.  IN LIGHT OF THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE 
LIKELY TO BE SCHEDULED IN NOVEMBER, AND THE DIFFICULTY FOR 
THE GOC OF IMPLEMENTING THOSE NEW INITIATIVES, WOULD IT BE 
POSSIBLE FOR WASHINGTON TO CONSIDER ISSUING A SIX-MONTH 
WAIVER ASPA FOR CROATIA, SIMONOVIC ASKED.  ADDITIONALLY, 
SIMONOVIC ASKED IF WE HAD RECEIVED ANY INDICATION THAT THE EU 
LAUNCH AN INITIATIVE ON ARTICLE 98 AT THE UPCOMING EU SUMMIT 
IN THESSALONIKI. (HE DID NOT ELABORATE.) 
 
7. (C) THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THERE COULD BE NO LINKAGE 
BETWEEN OTHER CROATIA FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES AND OUR NEED 
TO CONCLUDE A BILATERAL NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT.  THERE WAS 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUBJECT: CROATIA/ICC: STILL TAKING A TOUGH LINE ON ARTICLE 
98 NEGOTIATIONS 
 
LITTLE POINT IN DISCUSSING WHAT SHORT-TERM WAIVERS FOR 
ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE CROATIA HASN\'T 
EVEN BEGUN TO NEGOTIATE.  IN ANY CASE, ALL INDICATIONS WERE 
THAT ASPA WAIVERS WOULD BE FEW, AND, IF ANY WERE TO BE 
ISSUED, NATO INVITEES WOULD HAVE PRIORITY BEFORE CROATIA. 
THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT NO DECISION HAD BEEN TAKEN ON 
WHO, IF ANYONE WOULD GET A WAIVER. 
 
8. (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SIMONOVIC THAT WHILE WE BELIEVED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01047  02 OF 02  121715Z 
CROATIA\'S EU AND ICTY CONCERNS WERE UNDERSTANDABLE, THEY ALSO 
HAD TO BE PUT  PERSPECTIVE.  OUR SENSE WAS THAT WE WOULD 
SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EU ON ARTICLE 98 
WELL BEFORE BRUSSELS WOULD CONSIDER CROATIA\'S EU MEMBERSHIP. 
GOOD ARGUMENTS DIFFERENTIATED THE ICTY AND THE ICC; IT WOULD 
BE UP TO THE GOC TO CRAFT A MESSAGE THAT WOULD RESONATE WITH 
THE CROATIAN PUBLIC.   THE AMBASSADOR ADDED THAT HE HAD 
RECEIVED NO INFORMATION THAT THE EU WOULD ALTER ITS POSITION 
ON ARTICLE 98 IN THESSALONIKI. 
 
9. (C) THE AMBASSADOR AGAIN URGED DFM SIMONOVIC TO REVIEW THE 
VARIOUS AGREEMENT TEXTS WE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE GOC TO BEGIN 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH US ON AN AGREEMENT.  SIMONOVIC WAS NOT 
OPTIMISTIC, SAYING THAT, UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS, HE COULD 
NOT SEE THE GOC AGREEING TO A NON-EXTRADITION AGREEMENT, 
IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COST. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) SIMONOVIC\'S GAMBIT OF LINKING AN ASPA WAIVER TO GOC 
PROGRESS ON CORE REGIONAL STABILITY ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO 
US WAS A GOOD TRY FROM THE CROATIAN PERSPECTIVE.  THE GOC 
DOES NOT WANT TO EXPEND WHAT IT IMAGINES WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT 
POLITICAL CAPITAL -- BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND IN TERMS OF ITS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU -- TO SIGN A NON-SURRENDER 
AGREEMENT. 
 
11. (C) NOW THAT WE DISPENSED WITH THE GOC\'S MANEUVER, 
HOWEVER, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER OR NOT THE GOC STICKS 
TO THE NO-NEGOTIATIONS POLICY THAT SIMONOVIC DESCRIBED.  THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01047  02 OF 02  121715Z 
GOC KNOWS WHAT THE STAKES ARE AND HOW LITTLE CHANCE CROATIA 
HAS FOR A WAIVER.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS THE GOC TO FIND 
A WAY TO BALANCE ITS INTERESTS AND BEGIN TO NEGOTIATE A 
NON-SURRENDER AGREEMENT WITH US.  PROSPECTS CANNOT BE 
CONSIDERED GOOD.  PM RACAN IS NEVER EAGER TO RISK DOMESTIC 
PROBLEMS OVER ICTY, AND SIMONOVIC INADVERTENTLY REITERATED 
THAT THE GOC\'S EU BID COUNTS FOR MORE THAN NATO -- IN SPITE 
OF REPEATING LEADING REFERENCES BY THE AMBASSADOR, SIMONOVIC 
NEVER ONCE REFERRED TO CROATIA\'S MAP PROCESS AS AN IMPORTANT 
GOC PRIORITY.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. ON MAY 11, COMMEMORATION CEREMONIES WERE HELD BOTH AT THE 
JASENOVAC CONCENTRATION CAMP IN CROATIA AND SEPARATELY IN 
    BLEIBURG, AUSTRIA.  PRESIDENT STJEPAN MESIC STIRRED UP 
CONTROVERSY IN JASENOVAC, WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS -- MOSTLY 
SERBS, JEWS, AND ROMA -- PERISHED AT THE HANDS OF THE USTASHE 
REGIME.  MESIC APOLOGIZED NOT JUST FOR THESE CRIMES, BUT FOR 
\"ALL\" CROATIAN CRIMES, INCLUDING BY IMPLICATION THOSE 
COMMITTED IN THE MORE RECENT WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE.  ON THE 
SAME DAY, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER SIMONIC LEAD A CROATIAN 
DELEGATION TO BLEIBURG FOR A COMMEMORATION OF THE SLAUGHTER 
OF USTASHE AND NAZI TROOPS AND CIVILIANS BY PARTISAN FORCES 
IN THE WANING DAYS OF WORLD WAR II.  END SUMMARY. 
 
JASENOVAC 
--------- 
 
2. ON MAY 11, THE DCM LAID A WREATH AT THE ANNUAL 
COMMEMORATION AT THE JASENOVAC CONCENTRATION CAMP.  THIS 
YEAR\'S COMMEMORATION WAS HELD IN MEMORY OF AN ATTEMPTED BREAK 
OUT IN 1945 WHEN 1,100 INMATES WERE KILLED. 
 
3. STJEPAN MESIC, PRESIDENT OF CROATIA, ATTENDED THE 
COMMEMORATION FOR THE FIRST TIME AND DELIVERED THE KEYNOTE 
ADDRESS.  MESIC POINTEDLY APOLOGIZED FOR ALL CROATIAN CRIMES. 
 HE EXPRESSED DEEP REGRET FOR \"ALL THE INNOCENT VICTIMS WHO 
DIED, FROM THOSE WHO ABUSED THE IDEA OF THE CROATIAN STATE 
AND USED IT AS AN ALIBI FOR MURDERS, ROBBERIES, AND 
PERSECUTIONS.\" 
 
4. MODERATE MEMBERS OF THE RULING COALITION PRAISED THE 
PRESIDENTS REMARKS AND APOLOGY, WHILE RIGHT-WING POLITICIANS 
TOOK OFFENSE.  ZELJKO GLAVAN, AN HSLS MP, SAID CRIMINALS MUST 
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, BUT \"ONE SHOULD NOT APOLOGIZE FOR 
    SOMEONE ELSE\'S CRIMES.\"  JADRANKA KOSOR, DEPUTY PRESIDENT OF 
THE RIGHT-WING HDZ, OUTRIGHT REJECTED \"MESSAGES THAT 
EVERYBODY SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO EVERYBODY.\"  NENAD CANAK, 
PRESIDENT OF THE VOJVODINA ASSEMBLY (SERBIA), CALLED MESIC\'S 
MESSAGE \"EXTREMELY WISE,\" AND ADDED THAT SUCH \"SYMBOLIC 
GESTURES...ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO BUILD THE 
FUTURE WITHOUT BURDENS.\" 
 
5. A TELEGRAM FROM PRIME MINISTER IVICA RACAN WAS ALSO READ 
AT THE COMMEMORATION.  RACAN URGED THAT THE VICTIMS BE 
REMEMBERED AND STRESSED THE NEED \"TO PREVENT THE REOCCURRENCE 
OF SUCH HORRORS WHICH ONE HUMAN BEING CAN DO TO ANOTHER ONLY 
IF HE OR SHE STARTS BELIEVING THAT HE OR SHE IS BETTER THAN 
OTHERS.\" 
 
6. AMONG THE ESTIMATED THREE THOUSAND ATTENDEES WERE MEMBERS 
OF THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY, A GOC AND PARLIAMENTARY 
DELEGATION, EX-INMATES FROM THE CAMP, PARTISAN FIGHTERS FROM 
WORLD WAR II, SERBIAN, JEWISH, AND ROMA DELEGATIONS, AND 
SULEJMAN TIHIC, A MEMBER OF THE BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA COLLECTIVE 
PRESIDENCY. 
 
7. JASENOVAC, A SMALL TOWN TWO HOURS DRIVE TO THE EAST OF 
ZAGREB, LIES ON THE SAVA RIVER BORDER WITH BOSNIA.  DURING 
WORLD WAR II THE FASCIST REGIME OF ANTE PAVELIC ESTABLISHED A 
SERIES OF WORK AND TRANSIT CAMPS IN THE AREA.  THOUSANDS OF 
SERBS, JEWS, ROMA, AND ANTI-FASCIST CROATS LOST THEIR LIVES 
IN THE CAMPS. 
 
BLEIBURG COMMEMORATION 
---------------------- 

8. ALSO ON MAY 11, A COMMEMORATION WAS HELD IN BLEIBURG, 
AUSTRIA IN TRIBUTE TO THE SOLDIERS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 
WORLD WAR II USTASHE GOVERNMENT, NAZI TROOPS AND CIVILIANS, 
WHO WERE KILLED EN MASS BY PARTISAN FORCES AFTER THEY FLED 
CROATIA IN THE WANING DAYS OF THE WAR AND WERE TURNED BACK BY 
ALLIED TROOPS IN AUSTRIA.  SENIOR OFFICIALS PRESENT INCLUDED 
DEPUTY SPEAKERS OF PARLIAMENT BALTAZAR JALSOVEC AND IVICA 
KOSTOVIC, AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ANTE SIMONIC. 
 
9. ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS KOSTOVIC, A MEMBER OF THE 
RIGHT-WING HDZ, STATED THAT BLEIBURG IS \"A SYMBOL OF THE 
SUFFERING OF THE CROATIAN PEOPLE.\"  ADDITIONAL PRESS 
REPORTING MENTIONED ISOLATED PROVOCATIONS -- SOME OF THE 
ESTIMATED EIGHT THOUSAND ATTENDEES WORE FASCIST INSIGNIA AND 
CARRIED ANTE PAVELIC PHOTOGRAPHS -- BUT THE COMMEMORATION WAS 
REPORTED TO BE ORDERLY AND PEACEF

1.  (C) ELECTIONS FOR CROATIA\'S NEW LOCAL MINORITY COUNCILS 
WERE HELD ON MAY 18, BUT THE TURNOUT WAS SO LOW THAT THE 
ELECTIONS ARE BROADLY JUDGED TO BE A TOTAL FAILURE.  THERE IS 
ENOUGH BLAME ON ALL SIDES TO GO AROUND.  THE GOVERNMENT SET 
AN UNREALISTICALLY SHORT -- BUT LEGAL -- DEADLINE, FAILED TO 
EDUCATE POTENTIAL VOTERS ADEQUATELY AND DID NOT TAKE STEPS TO 
UPDATE A \"DISASTROUSLY\" OUTDATED VOTER REGISTRY.  MINORITIES 
WERE WARNED OF UPCOMING ELECTIONS WELL IN ADVANCE, BUT THOSE 
GROUPS WHICH CHOSE TO PARTICIPATE DID LITTLE TO PREPARE AND 
REMAIN DISORGANIZED.  THE OSCE MISSION IN CROATIA ISSUED A 
STATEMENT CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO HOLD REPEAT ELECTIONS 
WHERE COUNCILS WERE NOT SEATED, BUT SUCH A REPEAT ELECTION 
WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE LAW.  THE ELECTIONS COMMISSION 
HAS DELAYED RELEASE OF THE RESULTS, BUT PRELIMINARY VOTER 
TURNOUT DATA SHOW THAT, IN SOME DISTRICTS, OBSERVERS 
OUTNUMBERED VOTERS.  THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THAT THE 
ELECTIONS WERE LAWFUL AND THAT COUNCILS SHOULD BEGIN TO 
FUNCTION IN REGIONS WHERE ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE.  IN A MAY 21 
MEETING WITH DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ANTE SIMONIC, THE 
AMBASSADOR URGED THE GOC TO ENSURE GREATER PARTICIPATION BY 
MINORITIES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MAY 18 MINORITY ELECTIONS -- WHERE WERE THE VOTERS? 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2.  (C) CROATIA\'S NEW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL 
MINORITIES (CLNM) CALLED FOR ELECTIONS OF LOCAL-LEVEL 
\"MINORITY COUNCILS\" IN ALL MUNICIPALITIES WITH SIGNIFICANT 
ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS (SEE REFTEL FOR DETAILS).  SINCE 
EACH MINORITY COMMUNITY MAY ELECT ITS OWN COUNCIL (PROVIDED 
IT MAKES UP ENOUGH OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF A 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01164  01 OF 03  231059Z 
MUNICIPALITY), FULLY 470 COUNCILS COULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED. 
140 COMMUNITIES WITH TOO FEW MINORITIES FOR A COUNCIL WERE 
ELIGIBLE TO ELECT SINGLE REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE UP REGIONAL 
MINORITY COUNCILS. 
 
3.  (C) ELECTIONS WERE HELD IN LESS THAN HALF OF THE 
MUNICIPALITIES ELIGIBLE AND VOTER TURNOUT IN ALMOST ALL AREAS 
WHERE ELECTIONS WERE HELD WAS SO LOW AS TO BE LAUGHABLE.  IN 
ONE DISTRICT, ONLY THREE VOTERS TURNED OUT TO CAST BALLOTS 
FOR A FIVE-CANDIDATE LIST, A TURNOUT OF 0.13 PERCENT. 
MINORITIES BLAME THE GOVERNMENT FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO FIELD 
LISTS OF CANDIDATES IN TIME TO MEET THE SHORT DEADLINE. 
CROATIA\'S ETHNIC ITALIAN LEADERS CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT OF THE 
ELECTION.  IN OTHER MUNICIPALITIES, MINORITIES EITHER LACKED 
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO REGISTER AS CANDIDATES OR WERE NOT 
ORGANIZED ENOUGH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO PUT TOGETHER A 
CANDIDATE LIST.  IN A MAY 19 PRESS STATEMENT, THE OSCE 
MISSION IN CROATIA EXPRESSED \"CONCERN\" AT THE LOW VOTER 
TURNOUT AND CALLED FOR NEW ELECTIONS TO BE ORGANIZED IN 
MUNICIPALITIES WHERE THEY WERE NOT HELD. 
 
ETHNIC SERB POLITICIANS FOCUS ON RIVALRY 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) MILORAD PUPOVAC, PRESIDENT OF CROATIA\'S SERB NATIONAL 
COUNCIL (AND ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATIC 
SERB PARTY - SDSS), TOOK PAINS TO DESCRIBE TO US HIS 
ORGANIZATION\'S EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO LOCAL-LEVEL MINORITY 
COMMUNITIES.  HE AGREED THAT TURNOUT WAS DISMAL, BUT WOULD 
PRESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CONSTITUTE COUNCILS WHERE LAWFUL 
ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE.  SINCE THE LAW PREVENTED POLITICAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01164  01 OF 03  231059Z 
PARTIES FROM SUBMITTING CANDIDATE LISTS, PUPOVAC\'S POSITION 
ON THE SERB NATIONAL COUNCIL GAVE HIM AND HIS SDSS UNIQUE 
ADVANTAGE OVER RIVAL ETHNIC SERB POLITICIANS IN CAMPAIGNING 
FOR MINORITY COUNCILS.  PUPOVAC TOLD US THAT ONE INDIRECT 
GOAL OF THE CLNM IN CREATING LOCAL COUNCILS WAS TO GIVE LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES MORE OF A VOICE IN MINORITY AFFAIRS.  HE AGREED 
THAT OUTSIDE OF A SMALL, POLITICALLY ACTIVE ELITE, MOST 
MINORITIES ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN 
CROATIA.   MILAN DUKIC, PRESIDENT OF THE SERB INDEPENDENT 
PARTY (SNS - RIVAL TO PUPOVAC\' SDSS) WAS NOT ABLE TO MOBILIZE 
VOTERS TO TAKE PART IN ELECTIONS, AND SO DISPARAGED THE 
ELECTIONS AS A \"CHARADE.\" 
 
5.  (C) PUPOVAC TOLD US HE RECOGNIZES THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
DECISION TO SET THE ELECTION DATE WAS LEGAL, BUT POINTS OUT 
THAT IT WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN LEGAL TO SET THE DATE NEARLY A 
MONTH LATER.  FURIO RADIN, WHO REPRESENTS THE ITALIAN 
MINORITY IN PARLIAMENT AND ALSO CHAIRS ITS HUMAN RIGHTS 
COMMITTEE, DECLARED TO THE PRESS THAT THE LOW TURNOUT MADE 
THE ELECTION A \"FAILURE\" AND CALLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO 
HOLD NEW ELECTIONS WITH MORE REASONABLE LEAD TIME AND WITH 
GREATER EFFORTS TO EDUCATE POTENTIAL VOTERS.  OTHER ETHNIC 
LEADERS HAVE OPENLY SPECULATED THAT RADIN\'S OPPOSITION TO 
THESE ELECTIONS HAS BEEN MOTIVATED IN PART BY HIS CONCERN 
THAT THE NEW COUNCILS COULD DISPLACE WELL-ESTABLISHED

                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01164  02 OF 03  231100Z 
TEAMS OF OBSERVERS TO 48 POLLING PLACES.  WE MET WITH VLATKA 
SVEDRUZIC, WHO COORDINATED GONG\'S EFFORTS AND ALSO EXECUTED A 
MODEST VOTER-INFORMATION CAMPAIGN SPONSORED BY THE OSCE 
MISSION IN CROATIA.  SVEDRUZIC SAID THAT THE CONDUCT OF THE 
POLL WAS PROPER IN ALL RESPECTS, BUT NOT ALL POLLING PLACES 
WERE OPEN.  LOCAL OFFICIALS MADE TIMELY ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT 
WHICH POLLS WOULD BE OPEN, BUT THERE WAS CONFUSION AMONG 
VOTERS NONETHELESS.  CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT TO POLLING 
PLACES WAS APPROPRIATE, AND ADEQUATE RESOURCES WERE DISBURSED 
TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE POLL.  THE BIGGEST TECHNICAL 
PROBLEM WAS OUTDATED VOTER REGISTERS WHICH SVEDRUZIC TERMED A 
\"DISASTER.\"  DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH DISTRICTS HAD A 
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH MINORITY COMMUNITY TO WARRANT A LOCAL 
COUNCIL WERE MADE BASED ON THE 2001 CENSUS.  BUT THIS 
INFORMATION DID NOT MATCH VOTER ROLLS, SINCE INFORMATION IN 
THE CENSUS ABOUT ETHNICITY IS CONSIDERED CONFIDENTIAL.  VOTER 
ROLLS ARE ONLY UPDATED BEFORE A MAJOR ELECTION, SVEDRUZIC 
EXPLAINED, AND THE CURRENT LISTS DATE FROM PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS IN JANUARY 2000, AND THEREFORE DO NOT INCLUDE MANY 
FORMER REFUGEES WHO HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES IN CROATIA. 
 
7.  (C) SVEDRUZIC DESCRIBED THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS TO 
EDUCATE VOTERS AS \"MINIMAL.\"  CANDIDATE LISTS WERE PUBLISHED 
IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE 
ELECTIONS WERE MADE ON THE RADIO.  GONG RAN A MODEST 
GET-OUT-THE-VOTE CAMPAIGN WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE 
OSCE MISSION IN CROATIA.  SVEDRUZIC SAID THAT THERE WERE 
NEARLY AS MANY REASONS FOR LOW TURNOUT THERE ARE DISTINCT 
ETHNIC COMMUNITIES IN CROATIA.  SOME SERB POLITICIANS SAW THE 
ELECTION AS A CHANCE TO SCORE POINTS AGAINST THEIR RIVALS.

ETHNIC COMMUNITIES.  ITALIANS CHOSE TO BOYCOTT.  BOSNIAKS ARE 
WELL-ORGANIZED, BUT SINCE THEY WERE ONLY DESIGNATED AS AN 
OFFICIAL \"NATIONAL ETHNIC MINORITY\" WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE 
CLNM IN DECEMBER, THEY HAD TO CHANGE THEIR ETHNICITY STATUS 
AT THE POLLING PLACE.  (NOTE: BOSNIAK TURNOUT WAS STRONGER 
THAN ANY OTHER MINORITY GROUP, BUT WAS STILL RELATIVELY LOW.) 
 SVEDRUZIC SAID THEY MET WITH ROMA REPRESENTATIVES, BUT 
BECAUSE SO MANY OF CROATIA\'S ROMA ARE ILLITERATE, THE 
INFORMATION HANDOUTS DISTRIBUTED WOULD BE OF LIMITED USE. 
 
EXPLAINING LOW TURNOUT 
---------------------- 
 
8.  (C) ROMAN MESTROVIC, AN SDP MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT\'S 
HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE, TOLD US THAT HE EXPECTED THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE THE LION\'S SHARE OF THE BLAME FOR THE 
\"TOTAL FAILURE\" OF THE ELECTION, BUT THERE IS \"PLENTY OF 
BLAME FOR ALL.\"  MESTROVIC BELIEVES IT WOULD BE BEST TO THROW 
OUT ALL OF THE ELECTION RESULTS.  THE MAY 18 EXERCISE SHOULD 
SERVE AS AN \"EDUCATION\" AND, WITH TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE 
LAW, THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD SCHEDULE NEW ELECTIONS TO TAKE 
PLACE CONCURRENTLY WITH EITHER PARLIAMENTARY OR LOCAL 
ELECTIONS.  MATO ARLOVIC, SDP VICE PRESIDENT AND CHAIR OF THE 
PARLIAMENT\'S CONSTITUTION, RULES AND POLITICAL SYSTEM 
COMMITTEE, TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE LOW TURNOUT IS ACTUALLY A 
\"GOOD RESULT\" FOR CROATIA, SINCE IT MEANS MANY MINORITIES ARE 
CHOOSING THE \"CIVIC OPTION\" OF IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS 
CROATIAN CITIZENS BROADLY AND NOT AS MEMBERS OF INDIVIDUAL 
ETHNIC COMMUNITIES.

9.  (C) IN A MAY 21 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER ANTE SIMONIC AGREED THAT LOW TURNOUT WAS A PROBLEM 
AND AGREED THAT THE GOVERNMENT, IN HINDSIGHT, SHOULD HAVE 
PICKED THE LONGER TIMELINE.  HE DEFENDED THE LEGALITY OF THE 
SHORT DEADLINE, AND SAID THAT MINORITIES SHOULD SHOULDER SOME 
OF THE BLAME FOR THE ELECTIONS\' FAILURE.  MINOR GOVERNMENT 
SHORTCOMINGS IN PREPARING THE POLL HAD NO EFFECT ON VOTER 
TURNOUT, ASSERTED SIMONIC, WHICH WAS MAINLY DUE TO 
OBSTRUCTION BY OR DISORGANIZATION AMONG CROATIA\'S MINOIRTY 
ASSOCIATIONS.  HE SAID HIS PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT PART OF THE 
REASON FOR THE LOW TURNOUT WAS A \"GENTLEMAN\'S CONSPIRACY\" BY 
MINORITY ORGANIZATIONS WHICH BELIEVE THEY STAND TO LOSE 
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SUPPORT, BOTH FROM THE STATE BUDGET 
AND, IN THE CASE OF ITALIANS, FROM ABROAD WHEN THE NEW 
COUNCILS ARE FORMED.  PM RACAN\'S CABINET WOULD MEET SOON TO 
DISCUSS A WAY FORWARD ON THE ISSUE, AND HE SPECULATED THAT 
CHANGES TO THE LAW ON LOCAL ELECTIONS COULD BE PUSHED THROUGH 
TO MAKE POSSIBLE REPEAT ELECTIONS IN THOSE DISTRICTS WHERE 
THEY DID NOT TAKE PLACE.  HOWEVER, A MAY 22 GOC PRESS 
STATEMENT INSISTED THAT THE POLL WAS LEGAL, THE TURNOUT WAS 
IN THE RANGE OF WHAT IT EXPECTED, AND THAT THE RESULTS WOULD 
STAND.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) ON MAY 21, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER SIMONIC TO DISCUSS CROATIA\'S DESIGNATION ON THE 
SPECIAL 301 WATCH LIST FOR FAILING TO PROTECT U.S. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  SIMONIC IS IN CHARGE OF HEALTH AND 
MINORITY ISSUES.  SIMONIC ACKNOWLEDGED THE OBLIGATION CROATIA 
HAD TO RATIFY THE BILATERAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MOU, AND 
SAID A KEY GOAL WAS TO PASS THE DRAFT DRUG LAW, WHICH 
CURRENTLY INCLUDES LANGUAGE ON DATA EXCLUSIVITY.  SUBSEQUENT 
NEWS ITEMS QUOTED SIMONIC AS WILLING TO TRY TO PRESS THE 
CABINET TO SEND THE MOU TO THE PARLIAMENT FOR RATIFICATION, 
BUT MINISTER OF HEALTH VLAHUSIC WAS SQUARELY AGAINST 
RATIFYING THE MOU.  END SUMMARY.

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01187  01 OF 02  271602Z 
2.  (SBU) ON MAY 21, THE AMBASSADOR REVIEWED FOR DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER SIMONIC THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE 1998 INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY MOU WAS SIGNED.  THE U.S. NEGOTIATED THE MOU IN THE 
CONTEXT OF SUPPORTING CROATIA\'S BID TO JOIN THE WTO AND IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH A BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY (BIT). 
CROATIA WAS NOW A MEMBER OF THE WTO, THE BIT WAS IN FORCE, 
AND THE MOU WAS STALLED, DESPITES YEARS OF DISCUSSIONS, BOTH 
IN WASHINGTON AND IN ZAGREB.  HE WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT 
GOC FAILURE TO ACT HAD ALLOWED CROATIA TO \"DRIFT\" ONTO THE 
WATCH LIST.  WHILE OUR GOAL WAS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, THE 301 
PROCESS DID CONTAIN MECHANISMS THAT COULD WELL LEAD TO TRADE 
SANCTIONS DOWN THE ROAD IF THE GOC DID NOT ACT. 
 
3.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED APPROVINGLY THE NEWS THAT THE 
LATEST ITERATION OF THE DRAFT PHARMACEUTICAL LAW CONTAINED 
LANGUAGE ON DATA EXCLUSIVITY DRAWN FROM THE EU MODEL.  (THE 
LANGUAGE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE DRAFT AT LEAST ONCE 
BEFORE.)  HE HOPED THAT DATA EXCLUSIVITY WOULD REMAIN IN THE 
LEGISLATION, BE ENACTED AND IMPLEMENTED SOON. 
 
4.  (SBU) SIMONIC REMARKED THAT HE WAS RELATIVELY NEW IN THE 
GOVERNMENT.  ONE OF HIS AND HIS PARTY\'S (HSS -- CROATIAN 
PEASANT\'S PARTY) MAIN PRIORITIES WAS TO PASS A NEW DRUG LAW. 
UPON ENTERING THE GOVERNMENT, HE LEARNED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF 
THE MOU.  SIMONIC CONCLUDED THAT THE GOC HAD AN OBLIGATION TO 
THE U.S. TO RATIFY THE MOU.  CROATIA ALSO HAD TO FOLLOW 
INTERNATIONAL RULES, SUCH AS THOSE OF THE WTO, STABILITY PACT 
AND THE EU.  HE WAS NOT AN ECONOMIST, AND ADMITTED THAT HE 
HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN DATA ON WHAT THE EFFECT WOULD BE 
ON THE CROATIAN HEALTH SYSTEM OR ON CROATIAN COMPANIES OF 
INTRODUCING DATA EXCLUSIVITY.  SIMONIC SAID HE WAS PUSHING 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01187  01 OF 02  271602Z 
FOR THE DRUG LAW, WHICH WAS IMPORTANT FOR CROATIA AND HIS 
PARTY, AND HE BELIEVED THE MOU WOULD BE RATIFIED AS WELL. 
HOWEVER, HE WARNED, THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH WOULD HAVE TO 
COMMENT ON THE DRAFT LEGISLATION.  SIMONIC FLAGGED THE MOU\'S 
PROVISION FOR PIPELINE PROTECTION OF DRUGS AS A CONCERN AS 
WELL. 
 
5.  (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED SIMONIC FOR HIS RECOGNITION 
OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S OBLIGATION TO RATIFY THE MOU.  WHILE ANY 
COUNTRY COULD EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN RATIFICATION, WHAT HAD 
BEEN OF CONCERN IN CROATIA WAS THE LACK OF EXECUTIVE 
COMMITMENT TO PUSH FOR RATIFICATION. 
 
6.  (U) THE MEDIA COVERED THE VISIT FAIRLY EXTENSIVELY, AND 
FOR THE FIRST TIME REPORTED ON THE 301 ANNOUNCEMENT. 
(SIMONIC HAD ARRANGED AN UNUSUAL POOL SPRAY AT THE TOP OF THE 
MEETING).  AFTER THE MEETING, SIMONIC TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK HARD TO GET CROATIA OFF THE WATCH LIST, 
AND SAID HE WOULD PRESS FOR MOU RATIFICATION WITHIN THE 
CABINET.  HE NOTED THAT WHILE CROATIA WAS ON A LIST WITH 
COUNTRIES SUCH AS PAKISTAN AND JAMAICA (PRESUMABLY NOT A GOOD 
THING), THERE WERE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SUCH AS ITALY ON 
THE LIST AS WELL. 
 
7.  (U) THE MEDIA ALSO INTERVIEWED MINISTER OF HEALTH 
VLAHUSIC, WHO WAS LESS FORTHCOMING.  VLAHUSIC (FOR REPORT OF

THE DRAFT DRUG LAW WHICH WOULD PROVIDE DATA EXCLUSIVITY, 
CROATIA WAS DOING SOMETHING THAT IT DID NOT REALLY HAVE TO DO 
UNTIL EU ACCESSION.  IN ANOTHER PRINT INTERVIEW, HE IS QUOTED

8.  (SBU) WE HAVE HEARD FROM INDUSTRY SOURCES THAT VLAHUSIC 
MAY PLAN TO SUGGEST AMENDMENTS TO THE DRAFT DRUG LAW THAT 
WOULD DELAY IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL EU ACCESSION.  THE 
AMBASSADOR SENT A LETTER MAY 21 TO MINISTER VLAHUSIC, SHORTLY

OUR ALLIES IN THE GOVERNMENT -- THE MFA, THE MINISTRY OF 
ECONOMY, AND EVEN THE STATE INSTITUTE OF INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY -- AND RAISED THE AWARENESS LEVEL OF THOSE WHO WERE 
HARDLY AWARE OF THE ISSUE BEFORE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTER IN CHARGE OF HEALTH ISSUES.  THE 301 
ANNOUNCEMENT POINTS UP THE FALLACY OF THE HEALTH MINISTER\'S 
ARGUMENTS TO US (REFTEL) -- THAT IS, THAT SINCE THE GOC IS 
COMPLYING WITH TRIPS, IT DOES NOT NEED TO RATIFY THE MOU -- 
AND EXPOSES HIS POSITION AS PANDERING TO THE LOCAL INDUSTRY. 
WHILE THERE IS MORE MOMENTUM THAN BEFORE TO RATIFY THE MOU, 
THERE WILL ALSO BE A TEMPTATION ON THE PART OF THE 
GOVERNMENT, LOOKING AT THE LONG TIMELINE BEFORE THE NEXT 301 
REVIEW, TO PUT THIS ON THE BACK BURNER.  WE WILL DO OUR BEST 
TO KEEP THE HEAT ON.

SUBJECT: THE SAD STATE OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN OSIJEK 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF MITCH BENEDICT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) ON A RECENT VISIT TO OSIJEK WE STOPPED IN AT THE 
OFFICES OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY.  DOWN FROM A PRE-WORLD WAR 
    II POPULATION OF OVER 10,000, THERE ARE NOW ONLY 150 JEWS IN 
THE REGION, AND BY STRICT DEFINITION MOST OF THOSE WOULD NOT 
BE CONSIDERED JEWISH.  ELDERLY, POOR IN HEALTH AND RICHES, 
THE COMMUNITY FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.  HOWEVER, 
RESTITUTION OF PROPERTY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THEIR 
FINANCIAL STATUS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE JEWS OF EASTERN SLAVONIA 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (U) THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF OSIJEK (JCO) IS THE 
REPRESENTATIVE ORGANIZATION FOR ALL JEWS OF EASTERN SLAVONIA. 
 PRIOR TO WORLD WAR II, THIS REGION CONTAINED ABOUT 10,000 
JEWS THAT WERE DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL COMMUNITIES.  JEWS BEGAN 
TO LEAVE JUST PRIOR TO THE WAR; THOSE WHO REMAINED WERE 
DECIMATED BY THE HOLOCAUST.  FURTHER EMIGRATION OCCURRED IN 
1948-1952, WHEN THE CONSOLIDATION OF COMMUNISM AT HOME 
COINCIDED WITH THE BIRTH OF ISRAEL. 
 
3. (U) TODAY THERE ARE BARELY 150 JEWS IN THE WHOLE REGION. 
DARKO FISHER, HEAD OF THE JCO, SAID THAT OUTSIDE OSIJEK AND 
VUKOVAR THERE ARE ONLY SINGLE FAMILIES IN SOME OF THE LARGER 
TOWNS.  HOWEVER, BY STRICT CRITERIA MOST OF MEMBERS OF THE 
JCO COULD NOT BE COUNTED AS JEWS.  FISHER SAID AS LONG AS ONE 
GRANDPARENT WAS JEWISH, AND THE INDIVIDUAL HOLDS NO OTHER 
RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION, THEY ARE WELCOME AS MEMBERS OF THE 
JEWISH COMMUNITY. 
 
4. (U) THERE ARE LESS THAN 10 YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY, 
AND ALL OF THEM COME FROM MIXED MARRIAGES.  FISHER TOLD US 
THAT, GIVEN THE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION, 
    AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY AT TIMES OF PRACTICING AND MAINTAINING 
RITUALS AND TRADITIONS, NO JEW BORN IN THE AREA EVEN PRIOR TO 
WORLD WAR II KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN OBSERVANT JEW.  THE 
PRIMARY CONCERNS OF THE JCO ARE FOR THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF 
ITS MOSTLY ELDERLY, IMPOVERISHED AND ILL MEMBERS. 
 
PROPERTY RESTITUTION 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) THE JCO SUBMITTED A LIST OF 14 CONFISCATED OR 
NATIONALIZED PROPERTIES FOR WHICH THEY CLAIM RESTITUTION 
PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 30, 1997.  TO DATE NOTHING HAS 
BEEN RESTITUTED.  FISHER WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO SHARE THE 
BLAME FOR LACK OF PROGRESS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE SAID HE 
HAD NO DOUBT THERE WAS \"SOME BLOCKAGE\" ON THE PART OF THE 
GOVERNMENT.  RETURN OR COMPENSATION FOR EVEN A FEW PROPERTIES 
WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE 
COMMUNITY. 
 
6. (SBU) INCLUDED AMONG THE PROPERTIES IS THE SITE OF FORMER 
OSIJEK SYNAGOGUE ON THE MAIN STREET IN THE CENTER OF OSIJEK. 
THE SYNAGOGUE WAS BURNED DOWN IN 1941, AND THE REMAINS WERE 
CLEARED IN 1952.  AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, THE JCO WAS GIVEN 
AN ALTERNATIVE PROPERTY AS A FORM OF COMPENSATION, BUT THAT 
TOO WAS CONFISCATED IN 1955.  A MIXED COMMERCIAL/RESIDENTIAL 
BUILDING OCCUPIES THE SITE OF THE SYNAGOGUE TODAY.  THE 
THIRTEEN REMAINING PROPERTIES CONSIST OF BUILDINGS AND 
RESIDENCES -- THE RABBI\'S HOUSE, A SCHOOL, OTHER PROPERTY 
RELATED TO THE SYNAGOGUE -- EITHER PURCHASED BY THE JCO OR 
WILLED TO THE JCO BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. 
 
    7. (C) FISHER SAID THE COURTS DON\'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, AND 
CONSEQUENTLY DO NOTHING.  SINCE 1997 THEY HAVE RECEIVED ONLY 
ONE COURT DECISION ASKING FOR FURTHER DOCUMENTATION TO PROVE 
OWNERSHIP.  HOWEVER, HE ASKED RHETORICALLY, IS THERE EVER 
GOING TO BE A DOCUMENT THAT PROVES THE PROPERTY WAS 
CONFISCATED BY THE NAZI REGIME?

UNTIL IT HAS DEMONSTRATED -- IN ACTIONS, NOT JUST WORDS -- 
THAT IT WILL SUPPORT POLICIES WHICH ADVANCE OUR STRATEGY FOR 
ACHIEVING STABILITY IN THE REGION.  THAT WAS THE MESSAGE THE 
AMBASSADOR DELIVERED TO HDZ PRESIDENT IVO SANADER OVER LUNCH 
ON MAY 27.  THE HDZ CONTINUES TO TAKE A POSITIVE LINE ON SOME 
TOUGH BILATERAL ISSUES WHERE THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HAS NOT 
(LIKE IRAQ AND THE ICC), BUT HAS MADE NO PROGRESS TOWARD 
BENCHMARKS SET BY THE AMBASSADOR ON ICTY COOPERATION, REFUGEE 
RETURNS AND INTERNAL PARTY REFORMS.  SANADER SAID HE IS 
\"DEEPLY CONVINCED\" OF THE VITAL ROLE OF THE U.S. AS THE 
GUARANTOR OF SECURITY IN EUROPE AND PLEDGED THAT STRONG TIES 
WITH THE U.S. WILL BE A TOP PRIORITY SHOULD THE HDZ RETURN TO 
GOVERNMENT AFTER PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE CLAIMED THAT 
UNTIL THE NEXT PARLIAMENT IS SEATED, HE HAS LITTLE FREEDOM TO 
ACT ON SOME POLITICALLY SENSITIVE ISSUES, BUT PROMISED THAT 
AN HDZ GOVERNMENT (IF ELECTED) WOULD PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS 
ON THESE ISSUES THAN THE CURRENT COALITION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
FOLLOW-UP TO FEBRUARY MEETING 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) ON MAY 27, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH HDZ PRESIDENT IVO 
SANADER OVER LUNCH TO FOLLOW UP THEIR INITIAL MEETING ON 
FEBRUARY 21 (REFTEL).  WITH SANADER WAS MIOMIR ZUZUL, 
FORMERLY CROATIA\'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., WHO PARTICIPATED 
ACTIVELY IN THE DISCUSSION.  AT THEIR FIRST MEETING, SANADER 
HAD EXPRESSED KEEN INTEREST IN DEVELOPING CLOSER TIES WITH 
THE EMBASSY WITH A VIEW TOWARD SHOWING CROATIAN VOTERS -- AND 
POTENTIAL COALITION PARTNERS -- THAT THE HDZ \"REFORMS\" HAVE 
BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE USG.  AT THAT SAME MEETING, THE 
AMBASSADOR HAD SET OUT A SERIES OF SPECIFIC ACTIONS THE HDZ

NEEDED TO TAKE ON ISSUES RELATING TO REGIONAL SECURITY IN 
ORDER TO GET THE U.S. VALIDATION THEY SO AVIDLY SOUGHT. 
 
HDZ\'S SOLID SUPPORT ON IRAQ, ARTICLE 98 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER THAT THE USG RECOGNIZES 
THE STRONG SUPPORT THE HDZ HAS GIVEN TO THE U.S. ON TOUGH 
BILATERAL ISSUES, ESPECIALLY ON IRAQ AND MORE RECENTLY IN 
CALLING FOR CROATIAN TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH THE 
U.S.  SANADER SAID HE IS \"DEEPLY CONVINCED\" THAT THE 
TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS ESSENTIAL TO EUROPEAN SECURITY. 
 HE REGRETS THE CURRENT COALITION\'S ACTIONS WHICH HAVE 
DAMAGED THE RELATIONSHIP.  THE HDZ RECOGNIZES THAT CROATIA\'S 
FUTURE IS IN EUROPE, BUT THERE SHOULD BE A MORE APPROPRIATE 
BALANCE, RECOGNIZING THE ROLE OF THE USG.  IN AN HDZ 
GOVERNMENT, RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. WILL BE A HIGHER 
PRIORITY, SANADER DECLARED.  HE REJECTED THE ANALYSIS BY MANY 
IN THE MEDIA THAT HE HAS TAKEN PRO-U.S. POSITIONS ONLY TO GET 
OUR APPROVAL FOR THE REFORMS HE IS CARRYING OUT.  THE 
EUROPEAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY GAVE THE HDZ THE ONLY \"SEAL OF 
APPROVAL\" IT NEEDED WHEN IT VOTED TO GRANT THE HDZ OBSERVER 
STATUS IN THE EPP. 
 
AMBASSADOR: NOT ENOUGH PROGRESS ON KEY ISSUES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOOK NOTE OF THE CHANGES IN THE HDZ IN 
THE PAST THREE YEARS; WITHOUT THEM EVEN THE RECENT LIMITED 
ENGAGEMENT WITH SANADER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.  BUT 
THE AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT

SANADER: \"MY HANDS ARE TIED\" 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) AS HE DID IN FEBRUARY, SANADER EXPLAINED THAT HE IS A 
\"HOSTAGE TO THE PARTY CAUCUS\" IN THE PARLIAMENT, ALL OF WHOM 
WERE SELECTED BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED AS HDZ PRESIDENT AND MANY 
OF WHOM RESIST HIS EFFORTS TO TRANSFORM THE HDZ INTO A 
MAINSTREAM CENTER-RIGHT PARTY.  HE NOW SEEKS CHANGES TO THE 
HDZ BY-LAWS WHICH WILL TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
DETERMINING WHO WILL BE ON PARTY CANDIDATE LISTS FROM THE 
100-MEMBER HDZ \"EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\" TO THE 13-MEMBER PARTY 
PRESIDENCY, OVER WHICH HE HAS FIRM CONTROL.  IF HE SUCCEEDS 
IN MAKING THIS CHANGE AT THE JUNE 21 PARTY CONGRESS, HE PLANS 
TO MAKE SWEEPING CHANGES TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE PARTY 
CAUCUS, WITH MORE THAN 80 PERCENT \"NEW BLOOD\" IN THE NEXT 
PARLIAMENT. 
 
6.  (C) ON CESIC-ROJS, SANADER AGREED THAT IT IS TIME FOR 
ROJS TO GO, AND PROMISED HE WOULD BE OUT AFTER THE JUNE HDZ 
PARTY CONGRESS.  HE GAVE NO GROUND ON GLAVAS, INSISTING THAT 
AS FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED GLAVAS\' ONLY PROBLEM IS ONE OF 
IMAGE; HE HAS NO INFORMATION WHICH HE CONSIDERS CREDIBLE 
IMPLICATING GLAVAS OF ANY WRONGDOING.  HE ADMITTED, HOWEVER, 
THAT GLAVAS\' AGGRESSIVE APPROACH IS A LIABILITY FOR THE HDZ. 
SANADER POINTED OUT THAT IF THE CHANGES TO PARTY BY-LAWS HE 
SEEKS ARE APPROVED, THE ROLE OF THE PARTY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
-- OF WHICH GLAVAS IS A MEMBER -- WILL BE REDUCED. 
 
7.  (C) ON TAKING A PUBLIC, PROACTIVE STANCE ON ISSUES 
RELATING TO ICTY COOPERATION AND REFUGEE RETURN, SANADER SAID 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01230  02 OF 02  300953Z 
THAT UNTIL HE HAS A CHANCE TO CHANGE THE MAKEUP OF HIS 
PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION, HIS HANDS WILL BE TIED.  THE HDZ 
HAS, SANADER ARGUED, TAKEN THE LEAD ON SOME PROGRESSIVE 
POLICIES.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORT TO PASS A NEW 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES (CLNM) WAS 
FOUNDERING IN BITTER ARGUMENTS WITH ETHNIC MINORITY LEADERS 
UNTIL THE HDZ -- SANADER PERSONALLY -- STEPPED IN TO BROKER A 
COMPROMISE.  NOW, CROATIA\'S CLNM IS BROADLY PRAISED BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  REMOVING RIVAL IVIC PASALIC FROM A 
POSITION OF POWER DID MORE THAN JUST CLEAN HOUSE IN THE HDZ, 
SANADER CONTINUED; IT ALSO REMOVED A SOURCE OF INAPPROPRIATE 
INFLUENCE OVER THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, PAVING THE WAY FOR 
THEIR REFORM. 
 
8.  (C) SANADER MADE A STRONG PITCH FOR THE EMBASSY TO BEGIN 
TREATING THE HDZ AS IT DOES OTHER CROATIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, 
INCLUDING ALLOWING IT TO PARTICIPATE IN ONGOING USAID 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AIMED AT BUILDING POLITICAL PARTY 
CAPACITY.  THE AMBASSADOR DID NOT APOLOGIZE FOR SETTING A 
HIGH BAR FOR THE HDZ TO CLEAR, HIGHER THAN OTHER PARTIES, 
BEFORE HE WOULD CONSIDER RECOMMENDING THAT THE USG ENGAGE 
MORE CLOSELY WITH SANADER\'S PARTY.  THE HDZ WAS DIRECTLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DESTABILIZING AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE 
POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND WOULD HAVE TO DO MORE 
THAN DISCUSS POLICY CHANGES IN PRIVATE, THE AMBASSADOR 
EXPLAINED.  SANADER SAID HE UNDERSTOOD, REPEATED HIS 
COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, AND 
DECLARED THAT AN HDZ GOVERNMENT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT AND 
WOULD PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARD NATO 
MEMBERSHIP.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SANADER THAT THE USG WOULD 
RECOGNIZE REAL HDZ REFORM WHENEVER IT CAME -- BEFORE OR AFTER 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

REFORM WAS VISIBLE AND CLEAR. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C) AS HE DID IN FEBRUARY, SANADER STRUCK US AS 
PERSONALLY GENUINE.  DESPITE HIS ASSURANCES ABOUT HIS 
EAGERNESS TO IMPROVE HIS PARTY\'S STANDING WITH THE U.S., WE 
DO NOT EXPECT HE WILL MEET THE BENCHMARKS WE SET, AT LEAST 
NOT BEFORE THE NEXT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  WE EXPECT 
SANADER WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE CHANGES TO PARTY BY-LAWS 
HE OUTLINED TO US DURING THE NEXT PARTY CONVENTION, BUT WE 
RECOGNIZE THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE: POLITICAL HOUSECLEANING, 
NOT DEMOCRATIC REFORM OF THE PARTY.  ONCE HE HAS ALL THE 
REINS IN HIS OWN HANDS, SANADER WILL NO LONGER HAVE ANY 
EXCUSES FOR NOT DELIVERING.  UNTIL THE HDZ DEMONSTRATES -- 
WITH ACTIONS, NOT JUST PRIVATE STATEMENTS -- THAT IT IS A 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY READY TO WORK FOR STABILITY IN THE REGION, 
WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO HOLD IT AT ARM\'S LENGTH.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) CROATIA IS HEAVILY RELIANT ON FMF AND IMET FUNDING TO 
ACHIEVE ITS GOALS OF MODERNIZATION AND INTEROPERABILITY WITH 
NATO.  AS CROATIA STRUGGLES TO DOWNSIZE AND RESTRUCTURE ITS 
MILITARY, NEARLY 70 PERCENT OF ITS DEFENSE BUDGET IS CONSUMED 
BY PERSONNEL COSTS.  THE LOSS OF U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAMS WILL CERTAINLY SLOW CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARD 
ELIGIBILITY FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP AND THEREBY AFFECT OUR 
EFFORTS TO PROMOTE REGIONAL STABILITY IN SOUTH CENTRAL EUROPE 
BY MOVING THE REGION\'S COUNTRIES INTO EURO-ATLANTIC 
INSTITUTIONS AND USING THE LEVERAGE OF THE NATO ACCESSION 
PROCESS TO SPEED REFORMS. 
 
2.  (C) CROATIA VALUES THE HIGH LEVEL OF BILATERAL DEFENSE 
COOPERATION AND WOULD REGRET THE IMPACT AN ASSISTANCE CUTOFF 
WOULD HAVE ON THAT RELATIONSHIP, PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN THE 
IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF ASSISTANCE ITSELF.  POST IS WORKING TO

MITIGATE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF SEVERING MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE.  AT RISK IS USD 5.5 MILLION IN UNOBLIGATED FMF 
FUNDS FROM FY 2003.  WHILE WE HAVE NOT YET TAKEN STEPS WHICH 
WOULD WEAKEN OUR EFFORTS WITH THE GOC TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 
98 AGREEMENT, IT IS LIKELY THAT MOST OF THE FY03 FMF FUNDS 
COULD BE OBLIGATED BEFORE THE JULY 1 DEADLINE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CROATIA RELIES ON FMF FOR MODERNIZATION, INTEROPERABILITY 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3.  (C) BECAUSE THE GOC IS STILL STRUGGLING WITH DOWNSIZING 
AND RESTRUCTURING ITS MILITARY, PERSONNEL COSTS ARE A 
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH PORTION OF THE ANNUAL MOD BUDGET.  IN 
ITS MAY 2003 REPORT TO NATO\'S NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL IN ITS 
FIRST MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLAN REVIEW, CROATIA REPORTED THAT 
MILITARY PROCUREMENT MAKES UP ONLY ABOUT 18 PERCENT OF ITS 
TOTAL BUDGET.  SUBTRACT FROM THIS AN EXPENSIVE 
UPGRADE/OVERHAUL TO ITS AGING FLEET OF MIG AIRCRAFT AND THE 
PAYMENTS TO SERVICE AN EX-IM BANK LOAN USED FOR THE PURCHASE 
OF COASTAL AND AIR SURVEILLANCE RADARS, AND THE $5.5 MILLION 
FMF BUDGET IS THE EQUIVALENT OF NEARLY 30 PERCENT OF 
CROATIA\'S OWN NATIONAL DEFENSE MODERNIZATION BUDGET.  ALL OF 
THE EQUIPMENT IN THE CURRENT FMF PROCUREMENT PIPELINE IS 
INTENDED TO SUPPORT CROATIA\'S GOALS OF INTEROPERABILITY WITH 
NATO. 
 
FMF COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SUPPORTS BORDER SECURITY 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
4.  (C) CROATIA\'S TOP PRIORITIES FOR FMF, AS DEVELOPED BY MOD 
PLANNERS IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH EMBASSY ZAGREB\'S ODC, HAVE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01238  01 OF 02  301414Z 
BEEN TO PROCURE VHF AND OTHER WIDE-BAND RADIOS, IFF EQUIPMENT 
FOR CAF HELICOPTERS, MILES EQUIPMENT AND NIGHT VISION GOGGLES 
FOR THE GROUND FORCES.  THESE PURCHASES WILL HELP ACHIEVE 
FORCE INTEROPERABILITY WITH NATO.  RADIO EQUIPMENT ALSO PLAYS 
A ROLE IN ENSURING CROATIA IS CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING ITS LONG 
MARITIME BORDER; WITHOUT THIS COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY, 
CROATIA\'S NEWLY INSTALLED RADAR SYSTEMS WOULD NOT BE FULLY 
INTEGRATED. 
 
THE NUMBERS: WHAT IS AT STAKE 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) ALL OF THE FY 2000 AND 2001 FMF FUNDS HAVE BEEN 
OBLIGATED, ALTHOUGH EQUIPMENT HAS NOT YET BEEN DELIVERED.  OF 
THE USD 5 MILLION ALLOCATED FOR FY 2002, USD 377,867 REMAINS 
TO BE OBLIGATED (WORK ON THIS CASE HAS BEEN ONGOING; A CHANGE 
IN PRICE FOR NIGHT VISION GOGGLES HAS PREVENTED COMPLETION; 
IT IS NOT LIKELY TO BE COMPLETE BEFORE THE JULY 1 CUTOFF). 
NONE OF THE USD 5.5 MILLION FOR FY 2003 HAS BEEN OBLIGATED, 
AND UNLESS PROMPT ACTION IS TAKEN, THIS FUNDING IS AT RISK OF 
BEING SUSPENDED.  USD 700,000 WAS ALLOCATED FOR FY 2003 IMET 
PROGRAMS WITH CROATIA.  OF THIS AMOUNT, USD 599,179 WILL BE 
OBLIGATED BY JUNE 30, LEAVING USD 100,821 AT RISK OF BEING 
SUSPENDED AND REALLOCATED.

CROATIA VALUES BILATERAL DEFENSE RELATIONSHIP 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) FOREIGN MINISTER PICULA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON MAY 29 
THAT CROATIA WILL REGRET THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE DONE TO THE 
BILATERAL MILITARY AND OVERALL U.S. - CROATIA RELATIONSHIP 
EVEN MORE THAN THE LOSS OF THE FUNDING.  PICULA SAID CROATIA 
HIGHLY VALUES THE POSITIVE RELATIONS THE MOD HAS DEVELOPED 
WITH DOD AS ONE OF THE \"MOST POSITIVE\" ASPECTS OF THE BROADER 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  IN AN EARLIER MEETING WITH THE 
AMBASSADOR, CROATIA\'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. IVAN GRDESIC 
PRAISED THE OUTSTANDING CUMULATIVE EFFECT THE IMET PROGRAMS 
ARE HAVING ON THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE CAF\'S OFFICER CORPS. 
 THESE OFFICERS RETURN TO CROATIA WITH A VISION OF A MODERN 
MILITARY, ORIENTED TOWARD NATO AND READY TO ENGAGE WITH THE 
U.S. TO ACHIEVE OUR SHARED GOALS IN THE REGION. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
---------- 
 
7.  (C) WE CONTINUE TO PRESS HARD FOR THE GOC TO ENGAGE MORE 
SERIOUSLY TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT, BUT WE HAVE 
NO SERIOUS EXPECTATION THAT THE GOC WILL AGREE.  WE WILL 
ENGAGE WITH MOD PROCUREMENT SPECIALISTS TO COMMIT THE BULK OF

THE FY 2003 FMF FUNDS AT RISK.  SINCE THERE IS NO TIME TO 
BUILD A NEW FMF CASE BEFORE THE JULY 1 CUTOFF, THE ONLY WAY 
TO OBLIGATE THESE FUNDS IS TO AMEND AN EXISTING CASE.  FOR 
CROATIA, THIS MAKES GOOD SENSE, SINCE THE EXISTING CASE FOR 
PURCHASE OF VHF RADIOS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE MOD AS A 
TOP PRIORITY FOR FUTURE FMF FUNDING. 
 
8.  (C) WE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO PRESENT THIS APPROACH TO 
THE MOD IN ORDER TO RETAIN AS MUCH LEVERAGE AS POSSIBLE TO 
ENCOURAGE THE GOC TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT.  WE 
EXPECT AN INTER-AGENCY TEAM LED BY PM\'S AMBASSADOR MARISA 
LINO TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE IN ZAGREB ON JUNE 12.  POST\'S 
OFFICE OF DEFENSE COOPERATION WAS INFORMED ON MAY 30 BY 
DEFENSE SECURITY COOPERATION AGENCY (DSCA) EXPERTS THAT IT 
WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF COMMITTING 
UNOBLIGATED FMF FUNDING BY JUNE 4 IN ORDER TO BE SURE TO BE 
ABLE TO MEET THE JULY 1 DEADLINE.  WE WILL ENGAGE WITH THE 
MOD IN AN EFFORT TO COMMIT THE FY 2003 FUNDS IN TIME.

SUBJECT: CROATIA CONSIDERING OFFERING TROOPS TO IRAQ 
 
Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Croatia is actively considering contributing forces 
to support Phase IV operations in Iraq.  The idea of 
contributing a small number of military police to deploy as 
part of a multi-national unit has been broached with the 
Embassy informally several times, including with the 
Ambassador by Foreign Minister Picula, but a formal offer has 
not yet been made.  GoC officials seek a wide range of 
details in order to budget and plan for a possible deployment 
so they can brief the Cabinet and Parliament on the political 
and financial costs of a commitment of forces.  On June 4, we 
informed the GoC that, before the USG will engage in initial 
military-to-military discussions, PM Racan\'s cabinet must 
make a formal political commitment of its intent to join the 
coalition.  Before we can enter a more detailed discussion of 
operational plans, Croatia\'s parliament must approve the 
deployment of forces to Iraq, whereby Croatia would join the 
Coalition.  GoC officials expressed some frustration at 
having to make a commitment to deploy forces without details 
about cost and without assurances that Croatia\'s offer would 
be accepted, but were confident they could secure a Cabinet 
commitment solid enough to begin initial discussions.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (C) In the run-up to military operations to liberate 
Iraq, Croatia\'s political leaders were sharply and publicly 
negative in their response to U.S. requests to join the 
coalition.  While this approach may have won mild praise from 
some EU members at the time, senior GoC officials hope that 
offering to deploy troops to Iraq will help repair the damage 
they caused to the U.S.-Croatia bilateral relationship.  The 
GoC is exploring the possibility of deploying a small number 
of military police to Iraq as part of a multinational unit. 
While there has been no formal GoC decision to deploy, the 
idea of a Croatian contribution has been floated publicly and 
privately at all levels, including in the press on May 30 by 
PM Racan and by FM Picula on May 29 with the Ambassador. 
 
3.  (C) Croatian Defense Ministry policymakers and planners 
have engaged with us to try to determine what the modalities 
and costs of Croatia\'s so-far hypothetical deployment would 
be.  But until the GoC has made a more formal commitment to 
deploy forces to Iraq and thereby join the coalition, Croatia 
will not have access to detailed operational plans.  After 
consultations between DATT and experts at CENTCOM and 
USEUCOM, we prepared for the GoC a sequence of events which 
Croatia must follow as it prepares to deploy troops to Iraq. 
 
4.  (C) On June 4, Defense Attache and Poloff met first with 
Assistant Minister of Defense (Policy) Jelena Grcic Polic and 
then with MFA North America Department Head Miroslav Kovacic 
to explain how Croatia should proceed as it prepares to offer 
a contingent of troops to deploy in Iraq.  We made clear that 
until there has been a formal political commitment by the 
GoC, the USG will not fully engage with military planners. 
Assistant DefMin Grcic Polic said that this put her planners 
in a tough spot; until they had precise information, they 
would not have the projected cost details needed to draft the 
decision for the Cabinet to approve.  We explained that the 
initial policy decision by the Cabinet need not be a detailed 
document intended for approval by the parliament, but rather 
a formal declaration by Croatia\'s political leaders that 
Croatia seeks to deploy troops to Iraq to support Coalition 
efforts.  Grcic Polic was relieved, and speculated that a 
Cabinet \"Determination\" (rather than a formal \"Decision\") 
should be relatively easy to push through the Croatian 
bureaucracy. 
 
5.  (C) We explained that once the GoC makes the initial 
political decision to deploy, the U.S. could authorize 
military-to-military technical discussions, including a 
meeting at CENTCOM Headquarters with Croatian planners. 
These initial discussions should produce enough information 
about whether Croatia\'s offering meets the needs of the 
coalition and about the details and projected costs of a 
deployment for the GoC to take a more formal \"Decision\" to 
deploy and then forward that decision to Parliament for 
 
approval (required by Croatian law before troops can deploy 
abroad).  Once the Croatian Parliament approve the decision, 
Croatia would be considered a member of the Coalition and 
would therefore receive access to operational plans.  Then, 
detailed discussions about modalities and timing of 
deployment would begin, followed by, eventually, deployment 
of Croatia\'s troops to Iraq. 
 
6.  (C) At the MFA, Kovacic asked whether, before the GoC 
exposes itself to the political risk of making an offer of 
troops for Iraq, we could give assurances that Croatia\'s 
offer of military police would be accepted.  We replied that 
we could make no such assurances, but expressed our hope that 
we could soon count Croatia as a member of the coalition. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C) The GoC leadership seems genuinely eager to make this 
deployment a reality, but we will insist on a firm political 
commitment before engaging in serious discussions.  Such a 
political commitment to deploy should not be difficult to get 
through the Cabinet, and a formal decision should, if 
properly managed, pass the parliament.  Once this political 
commitment is made, however, we are not certain that the unit 
Croatia will propose will offers will measure up in military 
terms.  We do not underestimate how difficult a task it is 
for the GoC to deploy troops overseas; this is only the 
second time they have done it (the first time was to ISAF in 
January 2003), and the first time was a bureaucratic 
disaster.  The financial burden of even the small deployment 
of MP\'s to ISAF was difficult for the MoD budget to swallow. 
Given the decline in the bilateral relationship due to a 
number of GoC actions, the decision to deploy a small unit to 
Iraq should not be taken as more than it is: an effort at 
self-serving damage control.

SERVICEMEMBER\'S PROTECTION ACT BEFORE CUTOFF DATE.  AS 
INSTRUCTED (REFTEL A), ON JUNE 4 WE INFORMED THE GOC HOW IT 
CAN COMMIT THE USD 5.5 MILLION ALLOCATED FOR FY2003 TO AN 
EXISTING FMF CASE IN TIME FOR THESE FUNDS TO BE OBLIGATED BY 
JULY 1.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) CROATIA IS UNLIKELY TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT 
BEFORE UNOBLIGATED FMF AND IMET FUNDS ARE SUSPENDED ON JULY 
1.  AS INSTRUCTED IN REF A, DEFENSE ATTACHE, ODC CHIEF AND 
POLOFF MET ON JUNE 4 WITH DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER ZLATKO 
GARELJIC TO INFORM HIM THAT THE USD 5.5 MILLION ALLOCATED TO 
CROATIA IN FMF FUNDING COULD BE OBLIGATED BEFORE SUSPENSION 
ON JULY 1.  WE UNDERSCORED TO GARELJIC THAT THE FAILURE OF 
CROATIA TO CONCLUDE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WOULD STILL HAVE 
A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP; 
    NEARLY USD 6 MILLION IN FMF AND IMET SUPPORT ANTICIPATED IN 
FY 2004 WOULD CERTAINLY BE SUSPENDED.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE 
ADDED, CROATIA\'S UNWILLINGNESS TO CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT WOULD 
BE A BLOW TO THE BROADER BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. 
 
3.  (C) AS DESCRIBED IN REF B, WE EXPLAINED TO DEPUTY DEFMIN 
GARELJIC THAT, DUE TO THE SHORT TIME REMAINING BEFORE THE 
JULY 1 CUTOFF, THE ONLY WAY CROATIA CAN COMMIT THE FY2003 FMF 
FUNDS IS TO COMMIT THEM TO AN EXISTING CASE.  THE ONLY \"OPEN\" 
CASE WHICH COULD BE MODIFIED IN TIME IS FOR COMMUNICATIONS 
EQUIPMENT.  AS ADDITIONAL VHF RADIO EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN 
IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY, CROATIA SHOULD ACT QUICKLY TO 
MODIFY THIS CASE.  WE TOLD GARELJIC CROATIA MUST SEND A 
LETTER OF REQUEST TO MODIFY THE EXISTING FMF CASE BY FRIDAY, 
JUNE 6, IN ORDER FOR EXPERTS IN WASHINGTON TO OBLIGATE THE 
FUNDS IN TIME TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING SUSPENDED.  ODC 
PROVIDED GARELJIC WITH A DRAFT LETTER, PROPOSING A MIX OF 
AVAILABLE VHF RADIO EQUIPMENT WHICH WOULD MEET NEEDS 
IDENTIFIED BY MOD PLANNERS.  THE MOD HAS FLEXIBILITY WITHIN 
THIS FMF CASE TO CHANGE THE MIX OF EQUIPMENT, BUT MAY NOT 
APPLY FY 2003 FUNDS TO ANY OTHER CASE. 
 
4.  (C) IN A SEPARATE MEETINGS ON JUNE 4 WITH ASSISTANT 
DEFENSE MINISTER (POLICY) JELENA GRCIC POLIC AND WITH MFA 
NORTH AMERICA DEPARTMENT HEAD MIROSLAV KOVACIC, WE 
UNDERSCORED THAT THE DECISION ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT PROVISION 
OF THE ASPA WAS MADE IN WASHINGTON AND APPLIES EQUALLY TO ALL 
COUNTRIES WHICH ARE RECIPIENTS OF FMF AND IMET FUNDING AND 
ARE SUBJECT TO THE JULY 1 CUTOFF.  NEVERTHELESS, BOTH KOVACIC 
AND GRCIC POLIC WERE GRATEFUL, AND SAID THAT THE FMF 
ASSISTANCE IS VITAL TO CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARD NATO 
    MEMBERSHIP. 
 
5.  (C) UPON HEARING THAT CROATIA MIGHT YET BE ABLE TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF FY 2003 FUNDS, GARELJIC, GRCIC POLIC AND KOVACIC 
ALL EXPRESSED GRATITUDE, STATING THEIR ASSUMPTION THAT THE 
USG\'S DECISION WAS BASED ON RECOGNITION OF CROATIA\'S CURRENT 
REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM ASPA PROVISIONS DUE TO ITS 
PURPORTED \"UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES.\"  IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE OUR 
FMF REPROGRAMMING EFFORT, THUS UNDERCUTTING OUR DIPLOMACY FOR 
AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT, WE MADE CLEAR TO ALL THREE THAT THIS 
SAME INTERPRETATION OF U.S. LAW IS BEING APPLIED TO ALL 
COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO SUSPENSION OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE UNDER 
ASPA AND REPEATED OUR REQUEST THAT THE GOC ENGAGE SERIOUSLY 
IN UPCOMING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A POSSIBLE ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) So far, 2003 has not been a good year for our 
bilateral relationship with Croatia.  On issue after issue, 
whether Iraq, intellectual property rights, unblocking of 
assets of the Former Yugoslavia, or now our proposed Article 
98 agreement, the GOC not only has failed to deliver, but has 
antagonized us in the process.  The GOC\'s shortcomings -- 
lack of leadership, political infighting, bad PR, apathy and 
arrogance -- are well known and have hampered Croatian reform 
and progress on a host of issues.  We are not alone in this 
problem.  Our European colleagues share our frustration with 
the GOC\'s handling of refugee returns, cooperation with ICTY 
and (lacking) judicial reform.  The difference is that Prime 
Minister Racan eventually responds to European concerns, but 
not ours. 
 
2. (C) We have begun to press senior GOC officials about the 
deteriorating relationship.  Most recently, the Ambassador 
urged FM Picula to work to get our bilateral relationship 
back on track.  He told Picula that a good place to start 
would be concluding an Article 98 agreement.  Picula and the 
others left us in a disappointing, if familiar, place that 
boils down to: the GOC values the relationship but is 
unwilling to take any particular risks for it.  They trot out 
by-now shopworn arguments that it is in our interest to cut 
Croatia maximum slack because of the GOC\'s \"unique 
stabilizing role\" in the region.  We have discounted this 
line and stressed that if the GOC puts the U.S. in second 
place, we will reciprocate, and that will have consequences, 
notably in U.S. support for Croatia\'s NATO aspirations. 
While we see some signs that the GOC realizes it has a 
problem, we see less indication it will change its recent 
behavior.  Racan has made EU accession the leitmotif of his 
election campaign; even after that fear of ruffling EU 
feathers will be a powerful disincentive to take risks for 
us, and in any case Racan\'s domestic timidity and natural 
risk aversion bode poorly for this relationship.   End 
Summary. 
 
What a difference a year makes 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) In our mid-term evaluation of the GOC\'s performance in 
January 2002 (reftel), we warned that the GOC\'s poor 
management, the lack of leadership at the top, 
intra-coalition and intra-party fractiousness and underlying 
lack of sympathy for international community concerns would 
slow progress on the core issues of refugee returns, 
compliance with ICTY obligations and economic reforms. 
Nonetheless, we had registered important bilateral successes: 
 the GOC canceled dual-use sales to Iran and Libya, was 
active to a degree in the Global War On Terrorism and had 
helped several ways -- humanitarian assistance, arms for the 
ANA and sending Military Police for ISAF -- in Afghanistan. 
 
4. (C) In contrast, 2003 has seen a downturn in our bilateral 
relationship.  Variously due to an emergent EU tilt, timidity 
over domestic \"threats to stability\" or sheer neglect of the 
relationship, the GOC has mishandled or stiffed us on a range 
of issues, including but not limited to: 
 
-- IRAQ: Seeking to score domestic political points and curry 
favor with Germany and France, the GOC rebuffed our quiet 
overtures to join the coalition and then publicly exulted in 
its \"decisive\" no. 
 
-- IPR:  The GOC failed to move the 1998 Croatian-U.S. MOU on 
intellectual property to its parliament for ratification, 
despite repeated high-level interventions and warnings that 
inaction would result in Special 301 watch listing -- as it 
did this spring. 
 
-- SFRY ASSETS UNBLOCKING:  Croatia tried, very obnoxiously, 
to obstruct our unblocking of funds frozen in the U.S. under 
Milosevic-era sanctions.  It is the only country not to have 
ratified the Agreement on Succession Issues for countries of 
the SFRY. 
 
-- GWOT SHORTFALLS:  Despite constant reminders, including by 
the G8, since 9/11 the GOC has signed or ratified none of its 
outstanding terrorism conventions.  It also failed to provide 
information we sought on the movement of Iraqis through 
Croatia. 
 
-- PUBLIC INSULT:  In April Deputy PM Granic, PM Racan\'s 
right-hand man and the GOC point man on many issues of 
special IC interest, publicly insulted the Ambassador and 
other IC actors most engaged on war crimes matters in words 
widely assessed here as \"going too far.\"  Racan, while saying 
 
he disagreed, affirmed Granic\'s right to say what he wanted 
publicly and took no corrective measures. 
 
5. (C) We are not the only ones to feel the effects of 
Croatian foreign policy incompetence.  Granic did not only 
attack the U.S. Ambassador in April for insisting on full 
cooperation with ICTY:  the British Ambassador, the Dutch 
government and the last Spanish Ambassador were also 
broadsided, and their governments were equally irritated.  At 
PM Racan\'s (admittedly insincere) invitation in autumn 2002, 
all leading IC representatives here requested a meeting on 
refugee return issues.  Irritating everyone, Racan then 
ignored the letter, never set up a meeting, conveyed that he 
never would, and indicated he would not discuss returns 
issues anymore with local Ambassadors.  More generally, 
European ambassadors tell us that the GOC communicates as 
poorly with them as it does with us, with Ambassadorial 
access to PM Racan virtually non-existent. 
 
6. (C) There is, however, one major difference.  The GOC may 
not be very responsive to any outside advice or pressure, but 
eventually it does bend to EU pressure.  The most notable 
instance was in early April when Racan overrode a court order 
and had ICTY\'s indictment of General Bobetko delivered -- on 
a deadline day set by Chief Prosecutor del Ponte, and after 
the British specifically threatened not to ratify Croatia\'s 
Stabilization and Association Agreement if the deadline were 
missed.  Racan, Picula and other top Croatian officials make 
trip after trip to EU capitals to manage their EU relations 
and aspirations.  As some within the MFA have remarked, they 
make no comparable effort with the USG.  For example, 
internal recommendations that a high Croatian official visit 
Washington to discuss the Article 98 issue have not been 
implemented. 
 
Can this be turned around? 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (C) In a series of discussions over the past few weeks 
with senior GOC officials including Croatian Ambassador to 
the U.S. Grdesic, Deputy Foreign Minister Simonovic and 
Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Jakic and a frank 
one-on-one with Picula on May 29, the Ambassador and DCM have 
pressed the GOC to act to reverse this downward trend.  They 
stressed that the problem ran deeper that just the GOC\'s 
failure to deliver on issues of concern to the United States, 
though that was serious.  The GOC was failing to tend to the 
relationship.  Many problem areas had been due to sheer GOC 
neglect and apparent indifference.  Even quiet diplomacy is 
impossible, they noted, since nearly every one of our 
diplomatic overtures is leaked, or as often briefed, to the 
press.  These next-day stories too often include claims by 
GOC officials of U.S. \"pressure.\"  They feed press 
controversy that needlessly limits the GOC\'s scope to find 
common ground with us. 
 
8. (C) The Ambassador and DCM warned that it is increasingly 
apparent to us that the GOC has taken a strategic decision to 
put its relationship with the EU, its domestic sensitivities 
or indeed any competing factor we could identify ahead of the 
United States, and even on occasion to pit us against them. 
Such an approach would have, indeed already had had serious 
consequences in Washington.  The Ambassador told Picula that 
it was time for Zagreb to demonstrate its interest in and 
commitment to our relationship by coming down our way on some 
tough issue important to the U.S. Article 98 negotiations 
were a good place to start, but this was not about Article 98 
alone. 
 
You are right, but... 
--------------------- 
 
9. (C) Picula was at pains to stress the importance the GOC 
attaches to its relations with the United States, but 
acknowledged that over the past year the GOC had attended 
more to its EU interests.  The drift in GOC-U.S. ties, he 
explained, was more a matter of circumstance than intent -- 
the GOC is committed to maintaining excellent relations with 
both the EU and the United States.  He rationalized that 
momentum in the U.S.-Croatia bilateral relationship stalled 
when the GOC was criticized at home for \"failing\" to win an 
invitation to join NATO at the Prague Ministerial in November 
2002.  After that, the GOC decided to intensify its EU 
membership drive.  This and the demands of managing its 
oft-stormy relationship with ICTY have been the GOC\'s foreign 
policy emphases this year, but no slight was intended. 
 
10. (C) The GOC, Picula acknowledged, needs to be more active 
and positive in managing its relationship with the United 
States.  That said, Picula reiterated what we have heard 
before: the GOC values U.S. relations but cannot conclude an 
Article 98 agreement now.  Stepped-up EU pressure on Croatia 
-- including a very blunt letter from Patten and Papandreou 
sent in late May -- and domestic linkage between the ICC and 
ICTY make an agreement politically impossible for the GOC. 
 
His argument was the same as he, Racan and others have used 
for some time to solicit U.S. understanding of the \"delicate\" 
Croatian position.   It is a fill-in-the-blank exercise. 
Signing an Article 98 Agreement (or joining the Iraq 
coalition, or fulfilling ICTY obligations in the Bobetko 
case) would damage this reformist GOC\'s political prospects; 
that would create disorder in Croatia; that would throw 
Croatia\'s process of democratization off course; that would 
bring back the rightwing HDZ, end Croatia\'s contributions to 
regional security and thereby damage U.S. interests. 
Therefore, it is in the U.S. interest, at least as much as 
Croatia\'s, that Croatia obtain a National Interest Waiver 
from ASPA, that we not press for ICTY cooperation, that we 
\"understand\" its vocal rejection of the Iraq Coalition, or 
(fill in the blank). 
 
11. (C) We have cautioned our interlocutors that the GOC will 
not find much \"understanding\" in Washington for these 
arguments.   From our vantage point, it seemed that the GOC 
was over-dramatizing the difficulty in negotiating an Article 
98 agreement, whether from an EU or domestic opinion 
perspective, and it was doing nothing to try to guide public 
perceptions, work with us and demonstrate good intentions. 
There had been too many such evolutions.  Croatia could not 
presume that its relations with the U.S. would stay good if 
it did nothing to sustain them.  If, as appeared to be the 
case, Croatia was relegating the U.S. to the second echelon 
in its foreign relations, it could be sure that Washington 
would do the same.  This would have consequences.  As one 
example: a year ago, the USG had championed Croatia\'s entry 
into NATO\'s Membership Action Plan.  The GOC knew that other 
Allies had been skeptical but we had prevailed, as we can in 
NATO when we use chips.  Who could imagine that Washington 
would get out front pushing Croatia\'s NATO aspirations again? 
 Indeed, that Zagreb would fail to husband its U.S. relations 
knowing that its support at NATO HQ is thin raised questions 
about how seriously the GOC even took its NATO bid. 
 
Comment: Prospects Not Good 
--------------------------- 
 
12. (C) The GOC\'s disappointing handling of our request for 
an Article 98 Agreement has followed familiar patterns. 
There is careless incompetence: the GOC ignores issues until 
the 11th hour, shuns quiet diplomacy, then boxes itself in by 
needless media spin so that it reaching agreement is much 
more difficult for it, even if it wanted to try.  There is 
political cowardice:  instead of focusing on how to frame and 
sell hard issues to Croatian voters, the GOC preemptively 
capitulates.  There is arrogance:  the GOC really believes 
that it is indispensable to stability in the region, even 
though rapid changes in Serbia and Montenegro, slow but 
incomplete reform within the opposition HDZ and other 
developments render this claim increasingly overblown.  That 
arrogance leads the GOC to take for granted the substantial 
financial and political assistance we have provided since the 
Racan government came to power in 2000: roughly $175 million 
in SEED and military assistance and strong backing for its 
NATO and EU membership drives. 
 
13. (C) We will keep pressing the GOC to understand that 
U.S. attention and support is not Croatia\'s birthright, and 
that there must be more mutual benefit in the relationship. 
We\'ve seen some small signs that the message is registering 
-- media commentary is beginning to watch this seriously, 
there is some unease in marginal elements of the governing 
coalition and a few second-echelon ministers have expressed 
personal concern and interest in working for improvements. 
We have not seen such concern or interest at the level where 
it counts, however, and we are not sanguine that PM Racan, in 
whose hands this responsibility rests, will do anything to 
turn this trend around anytime soon.  Apart from being at the 
root of some of the GOC weaknesses that have undermined the 
relationship, Racan has decided that his only foreign policy 
priority in this election year, at least, is the EU.  He has 
been ready, even eager to  \"choose for Europe, against the 
U.S.\" to further that goal, even gratuitously when nobody is 
requiring it. 
 
14. (C) We, of course, must continue to seek ways to impose 
costs as well as offer benefits keyed to the GOC\'s handling 
of our bilateral relationship.  Realistically, however, we 
assess that we will not be able to bank on Croatian support 
on any risky issue, not only in this election year but (at 
least as long as Racan is in office) for as long as the EU is 
keeping its shaky membership application under scrutiny and 
ICTY is pursuing Croatia indictments.

Summary 
------ 
 
1. (C) ICTY Zagreb ResRep Thomas Osorio told us June 5 that 
the GOC is failing to deliver on a number of commitments PM 
Racan gave Chief Prosecutor del Ponte during her mid-April 
visit to Zagreb.  Census information was incomplete, 
assistance to gain access to bank records on GOC financial 
support to breakaway Croats in Bosnia has not been 
forthcoming and the OTP still is in the dark regarding the 
circumstances surrounding the arrest of ICTY fugitive PIFWC 
Ivica Rajic in Split.  Osorio told us not to expect any new 
Croatia indictments soon; del Ponte has decided to hold off 
until she has accumulated a package of 3-5 indictments that 
she can deliver to the GOC at one time.  GOC backsliding on 
its ICTY obligations is no surprise, but it did not help that 
del Ponte took the pressure off by waxing so strongly about 
\"improved\" GOC cooperation during her visit in April.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C)  In a meeting June 5, ICTY Zagreb ResRep Thomas Osorio 
told us that, although there was a surge in cooperation 
immediately after the visit of OTP Chief Prosecutor del Ponte 
to Zagreb in mid-April, since then the GOC has failed to 
follow through on many of its commitments.  Of greatest 
concern to the OTP is the GOC\'s failure to provide useable 
census data, one of the major points of discussion between PM 
Racan and del Ponte in April (ref c).  (Inter alia, the OTP 
requires these data to demonstrate Serbian ethnic cleansing 
in Croatia in the Milosevic trial.)  During the del Ponte 
visit, Racan reportedly instructed the GOC to comply with the 
OTP\'s requests, over the objections of Deputy Prime Minister 
Goran Granic.  Shortly thereafter, the GOC provided the OTP 
with what it asserted was a complete package of data on the 
2001 census. 
 
3. (C) Osorio told us that, after careful analysis of the 
data, the OTP determined that it was inadequate.  Not only 
were vital information elements of the census database 
withheld, approximately 340,000 census records were excluded 
completely.  On May 29, Deputy Prosecutor Blewitt (del Ponte 
was in Rwanda) wrote a strongly worded letter to PM Racan 
stating that the GOC\'s failure to provide the census data was 
a clear failure in cooperation.  Blewitt requested immediate 
intervention to provide the requested data. 
 
4. (C) According to Osorio, the GOC also has failed to meet 
other commitments it made to del Ponte in April: 
 
-- The GOC has yet to provide the promised assistance to 
secure access to Privredna Banka records detailing Croatian 
financial transfers to the para-state of Herceg-Bosna during 
the war. 
 
-- It has failed to certify that the 1000 pages of documents 
from former Defense Minister Susak\'s personal files that the 
GOC provided in early May represented the entire collection. 
Osorio told us that there is reason to believe that the GOC 
submission is incomplete.  OTP analysis of the Susak papers 
suggests the existence of more documents.  Additionally, the 
number of pages that the GOC declared to the OTP varied from 
1000 to over 1300.  (Head of the GOC Office for Cooperation 
with ICTY, Frane Krnic, told the Ambassador in March that 
there were 1156 pages in the Susak collection.) 
 
-- It has not provided the OTP with any information on the 
arrest of ICTY PIFWC Ivica Rajic and on the investigation 
into the illegal PIFWC protection network that the HDZ 
government established (ref b), even though Racan explicitly 
promised del Ponte that this information would be forthcoming. 
 
5. (C) Osorio said that the only silver lining in ICTY\'s 
relationship with Croatia is the excellent cooperation 
provided by Croatian Chief Prosecutor Mladen Bajic.  The OTP 
recently handed over to Bajic 11 boxes of physical evidence 
that the ICTY collected in the Paulin Dvor war crimes case 
that Bajic is pursuing.  (The Osijek court is about to begin 
the trial of two retired Croatian Army officials for their 
 
role in the murder of 18 ethnic Serbs and one 
ethnic-Hungarian in the town of Paulin Dvor in Eastern 
Slavonia.  Slavko Zadnik, one of Bajic\'s deputies, tells us 
that another six persons may be indicted for the crime. 
Others, including former HDZ intelligence and government 
officials may be indicted for covering-up the crime.) 
 
No new indictments soon 
----------------------- 
 
6. (C) Osorio said that del Ponte did not sign and forward 
any new indictments to the ICTY judge for approval prior to 
her departure on a three week trip to Rwanda in late May. 
According to Osorio, del Ponte has decided to wait until all 
Croatia indictments are ready.  Her plan is to deliver a 
package of 3-5 indictments at one time to \"minimize the 
political shock on the GOC\" (for more detail on the potential 
new indictments see ref a).  Osorio said that the net result 
is that we should not anticipate any new Croatian indictments 
any time soon. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) No surprises here: the brief GOC-OTP honeymoon after 
del Ponte\'s mid-April visit to Zagreb is over.  The Croatian 
Government has returned to its disappointing but familiar 
routine of shirking cooperation once the pressure is off. 
While the GOC clearly deserves the lion\'s share of the blame 
for not delivering fully and consistently on its ICTY 
commitments, del Ponte also bears some responsibility for her 
rollercoaster public relations approach.  In April, del Ponte 
was all sweetness and light, announcing that \"a very positive 
development of cooperation had been achieved.\"  Less than two 
months later the OTP is again complaining that the GOC has 
failed to live up to its commitments.  Under such 
circumstances it would not be surprising if the press -- and 
even some of her IC supporters -- might begin to question del 
Ponte\'s credibility.

Overview 
-------- 
 
1.  (C) With its application for membership in the EU\'s 
\"in-box\" and parliamentary elections around the corner, it is 
extremely unlikely that the Croatian government will move any 
closer to signing an Article 98 Agreement during your visit, 
or even discuss texts.  We expect their entire focus will be 
to argue for a waiver.  This will be one in a series of GoC 
policy choices which have damaged our bilateral relationship 
(ref A).  Your visit represents the USG\'s \"extra mile\" effort 
to prevent this outcome.  We look forward to your visit and 
to welcoming you to Zagreb. 
 
The Environment 
--------------- 
 
2.  (C) Croatia submitted its formal application for EU 
membership in December 2002.  Since then, every single GoC 
policy decision has been taken with a view towards how the 
Racan Government believes it will be perceived by the 
European Union.  In the case of Iraq, that meant not only 
declining our request to join the coalition of the willing, 
but publicly crowing about it.  On deciding whether to engage 
toward signing an Article 98 Agreement, that meant taking the 
Patten/Papandreou letter urging candidate countries\' 
adherence to EU guidelines as if it were Holy Writ and as if 
Croatia was actually under active consideration for 
membership in the near term. 
3.  (C) Croatia\'s coalition government came to power in 
January 2000, bringing to an end the corrupt, nationalist 
regime of Tudjman\'s HDZ.  Apart from ejecting the HDZ, 
however, the coalition parties had few major goals in common. 
 The Racan Government has managed to hang on through most of 
its four-year mandate, but it has been a rocky ride, 
including countless threats of resignations, several cabinet 
reshuffles and one genuine government crisis.  Although there 
has been no formal announcement, the next parliamentary 
election is widely expected to take place late this autumn. 
All of Croatia\'s politicians believe the best way to get more 
votes is to show that they are more pro-EU than their 
competition. 
 
The Arguments 
------------- 
 
4.  (C) The USG has been pushing Croatia hard, both in 
Washington and in Zagreb, to move forward on an Article 98 
agreement.  Although the GoC continues to tell both us and 
the public that it has not made a formal decision, we 
understand that the Racan Cabinet has already decided not to 
sign.  The excuses they will present in their meetings with 
your delegation are by this time very familiar, as are the 
reasons they believe Croatia\'s \"special circumstances\" make 
it a good candidate for a national interest waiver. 
 
-- EU Accession.  While the GoC downplays this argument in 
its discussions with us (since they know it carries little 
weight), it takes the admonition in the Patten/Papandreou 
letter very seriously and will not step outside the lines set 
out in the EU Common Positions.  Despite all indications that 
the EU\'s bark is worse than its bite, the GoC has not 
responded to our urging that it explore what the true, 
limited repercussions of signing an Article 98 agreement 
would be for its application for EU membership. 
 
-- ICTY/ICC Linkage.  Croatia\'s leaders have done nothing to 
explain the differences between ICTY and the ICC to the 
public.  (They acknowledge the distinction to us in private.) 
 As a result, they not only presume, self-servingly, but also 
make it more probable that voters would punish them for 
allowing the U.S. to exempt its servicemembers while sending 
Croatia\'s \"heroes\" to the Hague. 
 
-- Regional Stability.  The GoC believes that the U.S. should 
understand that Croatia is irreplaceable as we seek to build 
stability in the region.  Cutting U.S. military assistance 
would not only slow Croatia\'s progress toward NATO 
membership, but would also impede its effort to increase the 
security of its borders. 
 
-- U.S. - Croatia Relations.  The GoC believes that bilateral 
military ties are the strongest part of our overall 
relationship.  IMET training in particular has been a solid 
investment of good will and good intentions which is at risk 
if the U.S. does not grant Croatia a national interest waiver. 
 
 
-- Domestic Political Fallout.  GOC leaders say that voters 
will punish coalition parties if the GoC signs an Article 98 
agreement.  Since the opposition HDZ is still largely 
undemocratic and supports policies which oppose our goals for 
regional stability, the U.S. cannot afford to risk a return 
to power of the right-wing nationalists.  (This argument 
holds little water since the HDZ has already called publicly 
for the Croatia to sign an agreement.) 
 
Likely Outcome 
-------------- 
 
5.  (C) While it is all but certain that the GoC will not 
agree to sign an Article 98 agreement during your visit, it 
will present its engagement with your delegation to the 
Croatian public as a good faith effort to find common ground 
and to make Croatia\'s case for a national interest waiver. 
It also will likely seek to use the visit with us as evidence 
of its serious effort to reach common ground -- i.e., for us 
to grant a waiver. 
 
Managing the Message 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Croatia\'s foreign ministry has already approached us 
seeking to orchestrate a joint press conference and statement 
with a view toward minimizing differences and papering over 
the serious cracks in our bilateral relationship.  That also 
would mainly be for domestic consumption.  We turned them 
down and have instead organized a private interview for you 
with a very solid journalist from Croatia\'s least 
sensationalist daily newspaper where you will be able to lay 
out the facts about ICC and Article 98 and have them reported 
faithfully.

UNDP PROGRAM IN CROATIA 
----------------------- 
 
1. UNDP MAINTAINS A SMALL PRESENCE IN CROATIA; UNFPA IS NOT 
    ACTIVE IN THE COUNTRY.  POST RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS CONTAINED 
IN REFTEL PARA 7 FOLLOW. 
 
2. UNDP IS ENGAGED WITH THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT PLANNING PROCESS.  SPECIFICALLY, UNDP HAS WORKED 
WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PRODUCE COUNTRY-LEVEL DEVELOPMENT 
PLANS.  OTHER THAN THE COUNTY DEVELOPMENT PLANS, UNDP HAS 
DONE VERY LITTLE WORK IN THE AREA OF GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF 
LAW. 
 
3. HIV/AIDS AND ECONOMIC REHABILITATION OF WAR AFFECTED AREAS 
ARE THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE UNDP PROGRAM.  THE UNDP 
PROGRAM HAS BECOME MORE FOCUSED IN RECENT YEARS, SHIFTING 
FROM A BROADER HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE MANDATE TO TARGETED 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HIV/AIDS PROJECTS.  THE PROGRAM IS 
NOT FOCUSED ON REDUCING POVERTY. 
 
4. THE UNDP PROGRAM SUPPORTS MARKET-ORIENTED APPROACHES AND 
ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SUPPORT TO LOCAL ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES, AND FAMILY-BASED AND SMALL AND MEDIUM 
SCALE ENTERPRISE CREDIT SCHEMES.  THESE AREAS ARE APPROPRIATE 
FOR THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY.  YES, GOVERNANCE/DEMOCRACY AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE COUNTRY 
PROGRAM. 
 
5. THE UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE HAS PLAYED A COORDINATING 
ROLE ON THE ISSUE OF HIV/AIDS.  THE RESREP DOES NOT 
COORDINATE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BILATERAL 
DONORS, MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS, NGOS, AND CIVIL SOCIETY. 
 
COMMENT ON UNDP COUNTRY PROGRAMME OUTLINE FOR 2004-2006 
    --------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
6. ON \"PAST COOPERATION AND LESSONS LEARNED,\" WE AND OTHERS 
ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE REPEATED CLAIMS OF SUCCESS FOR THE 
ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION PROGRAMME (PARAS 10-13).  BY AND 
LARGE, THERE HAS BEEN NO ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION IN THESE 
AREAS.  WE UNDERSTAND UNDP HAS BASED THE NUMBER OF 4000 JOBS 
CREATED SOLELY ON THE NUMBER OF CREDITS THEY HAVE EXTENDED. 
UNDP IS NOT \"THE RECOGNIZED CENTRAL UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM 
PROVIDER\" NOR DO WE SEE THAT ROLE INCREASING IN THE WAKE OF 
THE DEPARTURE OF UNLO LATER THIS MONTH. 
 
7. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL AND STAFFING CAPACITY 
OF UNDP TO CARRY OUT THE PROPOSED PROGRAM AS OUTLINED IN 
PARAS 14-21.  UNDP\'S PRESENCE IN CROATIA CONSISTS OF A 
HEADQUARTERS STAFF OF A FEW PEOPLE, AND FOURTEEN PEOPLE 
DIVIDED BETWEEN FOUR FIELD OFFICES.  UNDP SIMPLY HAS NOT 
\"PLAYED THE LEAD ROLE IN CROATIA IN SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT.\"  THEIR ROLE HAS BEEN MINOR, AT BEST, AND 
CONSEQUENTLY WE QUESTION THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE 
POLICY ADVICE BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCES (PARA 17). 
 
8. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CROSS-BORDER INITIATIVES (PARA 21) 
UNDERTAKEN BY UNDP.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL ONGOING 
CROSS-BORDER INITIATIVES IN EASTERN SLAVONIA IN THE AREA OF 
BRCKO, AND ALONG THE UNA RIVER IN WESTERN SLAVONIA, BUT WE 
ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY UNDP INVOLVEMENT.  GIVEN THE STAFFING 
AND FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS UNDER WHICH UNDP IS OPERATING, WE 
QUESTION THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN PARA 21 -- AND 
THE SAME WOULD APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT, MONITORING, 
    AND EVALUATION ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN PARAS 22-25.

1. POPE JOHN PAUL II VISITED CROATIA BETWEEN JUNE 5-9 -- 
HIS THIRD VISIT TO THIS OVERWHELMINGLY CATHOLIC COUNTRY. 
IN HIS OPENING ADDRESS ON ARRIVAL AT THE RIJEKA AIRPORT 
    THE POPE NOTED THAT \"CROATIA RECENTLY SUBMITTED ITS 
APPLICATION TO BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART, BOTH POLITICALY 
AND ECONOMICALLY, OF THE BIG FAMILY OF EUROPEAN NATIONS 
-- I CANNOT BUT EXPECT A DESIRE FOR FAST FULFILLMENT OF 
THESE ASPIRATIONS.\" 
 
2. THE VISIT DOMINATED THE CROATIAN MEDIA AND WAS 
WITHOUT EXCEPTION PORTRAYED POSITIVELY.  USING RIJEKA AS 
A BASE, THE POPE TRAVELED TO DUBROVNIK AND ZADAR ON THE 
COAST, AND TO OSIJEK AND DJAKOVO IN EASTERN SLAVONIA. 
KEY POLITICAL FIGURES INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT, PRIME 
MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER WELCOMED THE POPE\'S 
MESSAGE OF SUPPORT FOR THE COUNTRY\'S EFFORTS TO JOIN THE 
EUROPEAN UNION. 
 
3. IN OSIJEK THE POPE GREETED A CROWD OF 200,000 AND 
NOTED THAT IN THE AFTERMATH OF WAR, WHICH LEFT DEEP AND 
STILL UNHEALED WOUNDS ON THE POPULATION, IT REQUIRES A 
LOT OF COURAGE TO PROMOTE RECONCILIATION, SOLIDARITY AND 
SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THE PRESENCE OF SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH 
DIGNITARIES WAS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE VISIT. 
 
4. GOC OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT RESTITUTION OF THE 
CHURCH\'S NATIONALIZED PROPERTY WAS NOT ON THE AGENDA IN 
MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT MESIC OR PRIME MINISTER RACAN. 
GORAN GRANIC, A DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND THE GOC POINT 
PERSON FOR RELATIONS WITH THE CHURCH, STATED THAT MANY 
INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE SIMILAR CLAIMS, BUT 
THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE PRIVILEGED IN THIS PROCESS. 
HOWEVER, PRESS REPORTS IN ADVANCE OF THE VISIT CITED 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH THE CHURCH 
    COULD RECEIVE AS MUCH AS 25 PERCENT OF THE STATE-OWNED 
CROATIA INSURANCE COMPANY AS COMPENSATION FOR A PART OF 
ITS PROPERTY NATIONALIZED UNDER THE COMMUNISTS. 
 
COMMENT

5. ACCORDING TO IVICA MASTRUKO, PRESIDENT MESIC\'S 
ADVISER FOR RELIGIOUS ISSUES AND CROATIA\'S LONG-SERVING 
AMBASSADOR TO THE VATICAN, THE POPE\'S SUPPORT FOR 
CROATIA\'S EU ASPIRATIONS WAS PARTICULARLY AIMED TOWARD 
THE LOCAL CHURCH, WHICH HAS BEEN VOCALLY SKEPTICAL OF 
THE GOC\'S EURO-ATLANTIC ASPIRATIONS.  NATIONALIST AND 
ISOLATIONIST TENDENCIES ARE MOST NOTABLE AMONG DALMATIAN 
BISHOPS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE GONE AS FAR AS TO PUBLICLY 
SUPPORT INDICTED WAR CRIMINALS.  WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT 
ANY CHANGES IN THE POLITICAL VIEWS OF LOCAL CHURCH 
OFFICIALS, THE VISIT SHOULD BOOST THE POSITION OF 
ARCHBISHOP JOSIP BOZANIC, CROATIA\'S TOP CHURCH OFFICIAL 
AND A REPUTED MODERATE, WHO HAS A REPUTATION OF BEING 
MORE IN LINE WITH THE VATICAN POLICY.

TAGS: KAWC, PREL, BH, HR, UN, UNSC, War Crimes 
SUBJECT: CROATIA/ICTY: PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA GOES PUBLIC 
 
Classified By: Poloff Robert Silberstein, reasons 1.5(b) and (d) 
 
1. (U) In an undated interview published June 10, ICTY 
fugitive PIFWC Ante Gotovina reportedly told Ivo Pukanic, 
editor of Croatian newsmagazine \"Nacional,\" that he 
acknowledged the authority of the Hague Tribunal.  Gotovina 
said that he was willing to surrender to the ICTY on the 
condition that the indictment against him is suspended and he 
is given the opportunity to be interviewed as a suspect by 
ICTY investigators in Zagreb.  Should the OTP then decide 
that an indictment is warranted, Gotovina claimed that he 
would surrender quietly to The Hague. 
 
2. (SBU) In the interview, Gotovina criticized Croatia\'s 
former HDZ government, saying that it failed to inform him of 
OTP requests to interview him as a suspect in 1998.  He was 
milder in his critique of the current coalition government, 
but said it too let him down as it failed to communicate with 
him at all after coming to power in 2000.  In what can only 
be termed revisionist history, Gotovina characterized himself 
as a \"victim of political manipulation\" from both the right 
and the left.  (Note: in early 2001, Gotovina was one of 12 
retired and active-duty generals who published an open letter 
harshly attacking the Racan Government for its decision to 
order the arrest of Croatian Army General Mirko Norac for war 
crimes committed in the town of Gospic in 1991.  Norac was 
convicted in 2003.)  Gotovina extended an olive branch to 
President Mesic, saying that he deplored an incident at a 
military barracks in Split in May 2001 when members of the 
local guards brigade openly cursed Mesic during the 
President\'s visit. 
 
3. (U) Prime Minister Racan, President Mesic and Deputy Prime 
Minister Goran Granic (day-to-day manager of the GOC\'s 
relationship with ICTY) reiterated that Gotovina had no 
choice but to appear in The Hague as an indictee.  Racan 
offered Gotovina the GOC\'s full support in mounting a legal 
defense once the PIFWC surrendered. 
 
Ready to surrender? 
------------------- 
 
4. (C) ICTY Zagreb ResRep Thomas Osorio told us June 11 that 
he believed the Gotovina interview was authentic and very 
encouraging.  He interprets the interview as a clear sign 
that recent stepped-up SFOR pressure in Bosnia (tightened 
border controls, sweeps of areas in which Gotovina was 
suspected of taking shelter, detention of suspected 
collaborators) is having the desired psychological effect on 
Gotovina.  So too is pressure from the international 
community; Osorio speculated that Gotovina appears to be 
coming to the conclusion that even if the HDZ returns to 
power he would have to remain a fugitive as any Croatian 
Government would be compelled to transfer him to the ICTY. 
Therefore, Gotovina may have decided to take the plunge and 
open what are in effect negotiations with the ICTY -- with 
the press, the GOC and the Office of the President as 
intermediaries -- on the modalities of an eventual surrender. 
 
 
5. (C) Osorio said the ICTY will not entertain Gotovina\'s 
demand that the indictment against him be dropped or 
suspended, even temporarily.  However, once he surrenders, 
the OTP can proffer \"face saving\" options.  These included 
launching a complete indictment review, in which Gotovina and 
his legal team could participate, and rewording or dropping 
elements of the indictment. 
 
6. (C) Separately, Osorio\'s deputy told us that they have 
received no indication that the Croatian police have 
developed new leads on Gotovina\'s whereabouts.  In a 
statement to police on June 10, \"Nacional\" editor Pukanic 
refused to disclose any details about where or when the 
interview was conducted, other than to say that it was 
outside Croatia  and that there were other \"witnesses\" 
present. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Whatever his motivations for giving an interview -- 
SFOR and IC pressure, a falling out with his right-wing 
abettors or ennui of life as a fugitive -- Gotovina, by 
acknowledging ICTY\'s jurisdiction, has embarrassed Croatia\'s 
political right, which had made him the poster boy of 
opposition to ICTY cooperation.  The GOC and President Mesic 
 
already have begun to make political hay of the interview, 
hinting that had the HDZ facilitated Gotovina\'s interviewed 
as a suspect in 1998, ICTY might have decided not to indict 
him.

SUBJECT: MESIC SPEECH AT EMBASSY OPENING FAILS TO BOOST 
BILATERAL RELATIONS 
 
REF: ZAGREB 1296 
 
Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
 1.  (C) On June 13, President Mesic attended the ceremonial 
opening of the new U.S. Embassy in Zagreb.  The Ambassador 
used the festive occasion to declare that the imposing, 
state-of-the art chancery is a concrete example of the United 
States\' long-term commitment to Croatia.  Rather than use his 
remarks on this occasion to step away from GoC actions which 
have harmed the bilateral relationship (ref), the approach 
and tone of Mesic\'s speech was disappointing and open to 
interpretation.  While he did note some positive elements of 
the U.S. - Croatia relationship, he also raised contentious 
subjects like the U.S. use of sanctions to punish other 
states, the possibility that the U.S. would seek to 
marginalize the UN or seek to slow the progress of EU 
unification.  While Mesic rejected the idea that \"the U.S. 
would even think about\" these actions, he seemed to be 
conveying his doubts about U.S. policies.  Mesic went on to 
re-assert Croatia\'s sovereignty and declared that the U.S. 
should accept \"a Croatia which uses its own head much more 
than a Croatia reduced to a subservient role.\" 
 
2.  (C) Our GoC interlocutors were quick to point out that 
Mesic does not represent the formal position of PM Racan\'s 
government.  Indeed, since Mesic was elected, he has been a 
willing partner with the Government in limiting the role of 
Croatia\'s presidency in an effort to prevent recurrence of 
the excesses of the Tudjman regime.  Croatia\'s President now 
plays more of a ceremonial role, and his statements are at 
times less nuanced than the GoC positions; that was certainly 
the case last month when he called U.S. action in Iraq 
\"illegitimate.\" 
 
3.  (C) After the Embassy ceremony, we called President 
Mesic\'s Foreign Policy Adviser Tomislav Jakic (the likely 
author of the speech) to express our dissatisfaction with the 
message delivered.  We told him -- and other GoC 
interlocutors -- that we thought the occasion and location 
was inappropriate for such an ambiguous and condescending 
message.  We also told him the message itself was wrong and 
unhelpful.  Jakic was defensive, saying the speech was 
intended to reject unequivocally the criticisms of U.S. 
policy, but said he would inform the president. 
 
4.  (U) Begin text of Mesic address: 
 
Ambassador Rossin, 
Distinguished members of the Diplomatic Corps, 
Distinguished guests, 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
 
I am pleased to be able to attend the ceremonial opening of 
the new Embassy of the United States of America in the 
Republic of Croatia.  I wanted to be here today in order to 
affirm in this way as well Croatia\'s friendly feelings 
towards the United States.  And I also wanted to see at close 
range and visit this impressive structure.  This is the best 
response to all those who speculate about the United States 
losing interest in this part of the world and in Croatia. 
 
Our two countries have long-standing relations.  They can be 
traced to the fairly distant past, to the time when many 
Croats and people from Croatia, then part of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, left in order to seek a place in the 
sun on the other side of the ocean, in the New World.  There 
is no need to recall the names of famous individuals who have 
come from our lands and made a significant contribution to 
the development and progress of the United States. 
 
Similarly, there is no need to recall what the United States 
had done on the global scale, but also within the scope of 
our bilateral relations, in promoting democracy, freedom and 
human rights.  Let me repeat: there is no need to recall all 
that, because we know it.  I would simply like to say the 
following: Croato-American relations have always been, and 
will be, relations of taking and giving on both sides. 
 
Of course, our relations have passed through different 
phases, they have seen their ups and downs.  But at any 
moment we in Croatia have seen and experienced ourselves as 
sincere friends of the United States. 
 
There have been and there are no anti-American feelings in 
Croatia.  We have always been and we are friends of the 
 
 
United States.  However, just as in any relations, it takes 
two to sustain relations of friendship.  In other words, the 
United States also ought to understand that our friendship is 
sincere and durable even when our thinking about a particular 
issue may differ from the thinking in Washington, D.C. 
 
We know that the United States has been the firm mainstay of 
the free world.  Therefore, we know that this excludes the 
possibility that the United States might even think of 
punishing any of its friends, with whom it shares the same 
values and ideals, for remaining true to the fundamental 
tenets of international relations - the freedom of 
individuals and nations and their full equality. 
 
We know that the United States played an irreplaceable role 
in the foundation of the United Nations, and that it should 
be given the credit, perhaps more than anybody else, for the 
sustenance of the world organization in times and conditions 
which were anything but propitious.  Therefore, we reject any 
thought that the United States could even think of 
marginalizing the global organization or even refrain from 
supporting it and thereby endanger its very survival. 
 
We know that the project of united Europe, in the difficult 
and extremely dangerous times of the cold war and of the 
East-West confrontation, could not even have started without 
the sincere and full support of the great ally on the other 
side of the Atlantic.  Therefore, we believe that any 
speculations according to which the United States does not 
regard European unification with the same enthusiasm with 
which its supported that millennial project for decades to be 
absurd and utterly unfounded. 
 
Today Croatia sees and realizes its place in the world within 
the circle of democratic countries, in the ranks of the 
global antiterrorist coalition, in the United Nations, and 
tomorrow - both in the European Union and the NATO.  We have 
never pursued our foreign policy by relying now on this 
country, or group of countries, and now on another. 
 
In line with the same principles, we want to have equally 
good relations with all countries, large and small, powerful 
and less powerful ones alike. 
 
We are aware of our European identity but also our global 
orientation. 
 
We are aware, of course, of the specific role and place of 
the United States in the world in which we live.  It is 
therefore completely clear that one of our foreign policy 
priorities is the continuation and broadening of good 
relations and even of alliance with the United States. 
 
But we are an independent, sovereign state, and until we 
transfer, by our own free will, part of our sovereignty to 
the European Union, we shall make our own decisions, bearing 
in mind first and foremost the interest and welfare of our 
citizens - over the short and long term alike. 
 
We shall always be ready to listen to others, but we also 
expect others to be sensitive to us.  Knowing the history of 
the United States, we are certain that it will best 
understand such a position and know to appreciate a Croatia 
which uses its own head much more than a Croatia reduced to a 
subservient role. 
 
Let me take this opportunity to convey cordial and friendly 
greetings to President George Bush and to the American people. 
Let me also wish the diplomatic representative of the United 
States, who will now work in this modern and impressive 
building at the outskirts of our capital, a pleasant 
performance of their duties in this traditionally friendly 
environment, geared to the continuous progress and 
development of ever better, mutually beneficial relations 
between our two countries.

Ministry of Health had deleted language from the draft 
pharmaceutical law that would have provided EU-

after failing to see Croatian progress on moving the

Begin Text of Letter: 
 
 
His Excellency 
Ivica Racan 
Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia, 
Zagreb 
 
June 16, 2003 
Dear Mr. Prime Minister: 
 
I am writing to express the continuing request of my 
government that the Croatian government forward to the 
Sabor the U.S.-Croatian Memorandum of Understanding on 
Intellectual Property, signed in 1998.  I also write to 
express our concern that language to protect 
pharmaceutical test data has been removed from the draft 
Pharmaceutical Law.  This language, while not 
substituting for ratification of the Memorandum of 
Understanding, would help address one of our major 
concerns regarding Croatia\'s inadequate protection of 
the intellectual property rights of U.S. as well as 
other foreign companies.  Its deletion further calls 
into question the willingness of the Government of 
Croatia to fulfill its obligation to the U.S. to ratify 
the Memorandum of Understanding, which is an important 
outstanding matter in our relations. 
 
You will recall that the U.S. actively supported 
Croatia\'s entry to the WTO and has brought into effect 
the Bilateral Investment Treaty, both measures to which 
we agreed as part of a package with the Memorandum of 
Understanding.  We fulfilled our commitments in this 
matter; Croatia has not yet done so.  That failure led 
to Croatia being named to the U.S. Special 301 Watch 
List.  In the absence of concrete progress, Croatia will 
eventually face trade sanctions.  This is troubling, 
especially in the context of other recent 
disappointments in our bilateral relationship.

BROADBAND FIXED WIRELESS MARKET IN CROATIA 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
A.Croatia has allocated an unlicensed frequency band 
of 2400-2483.5 MHz with limitation on Effective 
Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) equal to 100 mW, and 
5725-5875 MHz with EIRP equal to 25 mW.  There are no 
separate allocations for indoor and outdoor uses.  A 
license is required for the use of 3.5GHZ spectrum. 
 
B.The demand for BFW can be only roughly estimated. 
 Independent researchers estimate that 1.4 million 
n 
people in Croatia (out of total population of 4.3 
million) have Internet access.  According to the 
Institute for Telecommunications, which issues 
approvals for import of BFW units, thousands of such 
units have been imported into Croatia in the past three 
years, but there is no information on how many are used 
in commercial networks. 
 
C.An operating license is required for BFW services 
provided in the 3.5GHz spectrum.  Additionally, every 
Internet service provider must obtain a license from 
the Croatian Telecommunications Institute, located at:

BFW systems operating in the 2.4GHz range are not 
required to have a license provided that they meet the 
above frequency and EIRP requirements (see paragraph A) 
and that they are certified according to relevant ETSI 
(European Telecommunications Standardization Institute) 
technical specifications. 
 
 
D.There are no ownership limits for companies 
offering BFW services.  However, until 2005, the local 
incumbent operator, Hrvatske telekomunikacije, reserves 
the exclusive right to offer real time voice services. 
 
E. Every telecommunications operator offering 
interconnection has to publish its interconnection 
tariffs.  The tariffs have to be approved by the 
Croatian Telecommunications Institute. 
 
F.n/a 
 
G.Four out of eight Internet service providers in 
Croatia use commercial BFW networks to connect 
customers to the Internet or to link two different 
locations of the same customer.  Small range devices 
(SRD) are used by ISPs for connecting users in the 
urban areas.  Companies also use SRD for intranet

1.  After hearing from industry contacts that the

Begin Text of Letter: 
 
 
His Excellency 
Ivica Racan 
Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia, 
Zagreb 
 
June 16, 2003 
Dear Mr. Prime Minister: 
 
I am writing to express the continuing request of my 
government that the Croatian government forward to the 
Sabor the U.S.-Croatian Memorandum of Understanding on 
Intellectual Property, signed in 1998.  I also write to 
express our concern that language to protect 
pharmaceutical test data has been removed from the draft 
Pharmaceutical Law.  This language, while not 
substituting for ratification of the Memorandum of 
Understanding, would help address one of our major 
concerns regarding Croatia\'s inadequate protection of 
the intellectual property rights of U.S. as well as 
other foreign companies.  Its deletion further calls 
into question the willingness of the Government of 
Croatia to fulfill its obligation to the U.S. to ratify 
the Memorandum of Understanding, which is an important 
outstanding matter in our relations. 
 
You will recall that the U.S. actively supported 
Croatia\'s entry to the WTO and has brought into effect 
the Bilateral Investment Treaty, both measures to which 
we agreed as part of a package with the Memorandum of 
Understanding.  We fulfilled our commitments in this 
matter; Croatia has not yet done so.  That failure led 
to Croatia being named to the U.S. Special 301 Watch 
List.  In the absence of concrete progress, Croatia will 
eventually face trade sanctions.  This is troubling, 
especially in the context of other recent 
disappointments in our bilateral relationship.

SUBJECT: CROATIA REACTION: 2003 TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
REPORT 
 
 
1. (SBU) We were called in to the Foreign Ministry on June 13 
to discuss the recently released 2003 Trafficking in Persons 
report.  Dubravka Simonovic, Head of the Human Rights section 
in the Department for UN and Human Rights, asked for an 
explanation of why Croatia was placed as a tier 2 country in 
the Department\'s 2003 Trafficking in Persons report.  She 
observed that to be included in the report a country would 
have to have a significant number of trafficking victims, 
defined as not less than 100 victims.  She then pointed out 
that there have been eight victims in Croatia, a number that 
is agreed upon by NGOs, international organizations, and the 
GOC. 
 
2. (SBU) We explained that the assessment of a \"significant\" 
number of victims was based not just on the number of known 
victims, but also on the number of women trafficked into 
Western Europe, the number of women trafficked from source 
countries, the fact that one of the three known routes from 
source countries to Western Europe goes through Croatia, and 
the fact that the police deport many women without ever 
questioning how they got into Croatia.  Based on these 
factors, we think its reasonable that a significant number of 
victims are trafficked through Croatia.  Simonovic summarized 
that our assessment was based on an \"assumption,\" and we need 
more credible data.  Besides challenging us on the data, she 
also questioned where Bosnia and Serbia and Montenegro were 
on the report, and wanted to know why Macedonia was a tier 1 
country \"when they have a much bigger problem than we do.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Despite the disagreement over numbers, Simonovic 
affirmed that Croatia had the political will to address the 
problem of trafficking, and that it wishes to work closely 
with us to address the issue.  She asked what they needed to 
do to come into compliance with the Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act.  We provided her with a summary of activities 
and deadlines from Croatia\'s National Action Plan to suppress 
trafficking, approved by the GOC last November, and pointed 
out how little had been implemented in the intervening time 
period.  She admitted that the deadlines were not realistic 
and that this issue needed to be addressed by the National 
Committee.  She further bemoaned the limited availability of 
GOC funding for trafficking activities, yet assured us that 
the ministries allocate additional funding beyond the 
approximately $16,000 available through the Government Human 
Rights Office for trafficking activities. 
 
4. (SBU) We later met with Ivana Werft, Secretary to the 
National Committee for the Suppression of Trafficking in 
Persons.  Werft has been a willing and able interlocutor on 
trafficking issues, and has worked to bridge the gap between 
NGO activists and the GOC on trafficking issues.  Like 
Simonovic, Werft was concerned with the report\'s finding that 
Croatia has a significant problem of over 100 cases of 
trafficking when all agree that there have been eight 
identified victims.  To illustrate the problems connected 
with transit and identification of trafficking, she 
rhetorically asked what border police can do, and what data 
can be gleaned from a situation, when, for example, police 
stop, question, and then send on their way young women from 
the Balkans who are legally transiting Croatia and say they 
are en route to a job in Western Europe.  Werft pointed out 
that of the eight known victims in Croatia, two had been 
identified while transiting Croatia, a testimony to increased 
awareness and training. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (U) The very nature of the crime of trafficking creates 
serious obstacles in terms of compiling accurate and reliable 
data, particularly in countries that are believed to be 
primarily transit countries.  All those working on the issue 
locally recognize the problem of a lack of data, yet NGOs and 
the International Office for Migration (IOM) have and 
continue to request donor funding solely for awareness 
raising and prevention activities.  Our requests to the 
Stability Pact for examples or models of good data collection 
projects have not met with success. 
 
6. (U) We had prepared both Simonovic and Werft in advance 
for the tier 2 listing.  In part due to our aggressive 
engagement on the issue -- for months we took every 
opportunity to forewarn that we anticipated Croatia may be 
listed as a tier 2 country -- both Simonovic and Werft told 
us they were not surprised at the listing and had in fact 
expected it. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Despite the challenges to us on the numbers, the 
tier 2 placement has had the predictable effect of sharpening 
the GOC\'s focus on the issue.  Simonovic specifically stated 
that the issue is now a priority for the GOC because the IC 
has made it a priority.  As with refugee and return and 
reintegration issues, where the international community 
focuses, the GOC responds.  We will strive to maintain their 
attention on this issue in the hope that increased GOC 
funding and meaningful activities will result.

SUBJECT: LINO DELEGATION VISIT: CROATIA WILL NOT SIGN 
ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT 
 
REF: A. ZAGREB 1298 
 
     B. ZAGREB 1364 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Lawrence Rossin for Reasons 1.5 (B and D) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Citing both political and legal reasons, the GoC told 
PM/B\'s Ambassador Marisa Lino on June 12 that Croatia cannot 
now sign an Article 98 Agreement.  EU pressure, Croatia\'s 
status as a signatory of the Rome Statute and a \"sensitive\" 
domestic political environment were the main reasons cited by 
the GoC\'s high-level inter-agency delegation which met with 
Lino.  The Croatian side claimed that agreements now in force 
-- like the PFP SOFA and protections for NATO forces built 
into the Dayton Accords -- provide most of the protections 
the U.S. is seeking.  Nevertheless, the GoC proposed that it 
might be possible to include the provisions of a 
non-surrender agreement into a broader document on bilateral 
legal cooperation.  Lino expressed skepticism, but said the 
U.S. would be pleased to review any proposal. 
 
2.  (C) During and after the visit, the GoC sought to spin 
its engagement with the Lino delegation as proof that it is 
doing its part to improve U.S. - Croatia bilateral relations. 
 In the press, however, the GoC crowed about turning down the 
USG in an apparent effort to make political hay with voters 
at home and to curry favor with the EU, which is now 
considering Croatia\'s application for membership.  End 
Summary. 
 
Croatia Takes Talks Seriously 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) On June 12, PM/B Senior Negotiator Ambassador Marisa 
Lino led an inter-agency delegation to Zagreb to encourage 
Croatia to move closer to signing an Article 98 non-surrender 
agreement with the U.S.  Lino\'s delegation included top-level 
legal and policy experts from both State and DoD.  The 
Croatian delegation was authoritative, led by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Ivan Simonovic, and included Deputy Defense Minister 
Gareljic and legal and policy experts from the Foreign 
Affairs, Defense and Justice Ministries.  Also present was 
Ivo Josipovic, formally a professor of Law at Zagreb 
University, but informally PM Racan\'s top legal advisor; he 
was Croatia\'s representative at the prepcon for the Rome 
Statute. 
 
PM Racan Message: Work With Us, Please 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Simonovic sought a private meeting with Ambassadors 
Lino and Rossin in advance of the meeting of the two 
delegations.  In it he outlined the Croatian positions that 
would be expanded upon in the larger session.  Conveying a 
\"personal message\" from PM Racan, Simonovic said Croatia 
understands U.S. concerns about the Rome statute and 
recognizes the U.S. vulnerability to politically motivated 
indictments.  Croatia will \"do all it can\" to work with the 
USG, Simonovic continued, but only within its \"limited 
maneuvering space.\"  Simonovic pointed out that, because of 
existing agreements, there is no possibility that any member 
of the U.S. armed forces could be extradited to the ICC. 
Simonovic acknowledged that the GoC\'s legal arguments against 
signing a non-surrender agreement as proposed by the U.S. are 
\"not unique,\" and focused instead on Croatia\'s \"special 
political circumstances.\" 
ICC/ICTY Issue Toughest Nut to Crack 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) The most difficult issue will continue to be the 
association of the ICC with ICTY.  Technically, Simonovic 
told Lino, Croatia voluntarily accepted the jurisdiction of 
the ICTY, but the reality is that it was imposed by the 
international community; Croatia had no choice in the matter. 
 If the GoC were to sign an exemption for Americans, it would 
be impossible to convince Croatia\'s voters that this was not 
a double standard.  Simonovic did not mention EU pressure (we 
have assured him and others that this argument carries little 
weight with us), but he insisted that Croatia cannot be a 
\"showcase signatory,\" and that more EU countries would have 
to sign non-surrender agreements before Croatia could 
consider signing the text as we proposed it.  Simonovic 
underscored Croatia\'s \"unique position\" by describing its 
three categories of neighbors: 
 
- countries which are already signatories of Article 98 
agreements (and do not have immediate EU aspirations); 
- countries which are not signatories and do not receive 
military assistance from the U.S.; and 
- countries which are either already in NATO or soon will be. 
 
 
That, he said, left only Croatia.  Surely it was not our 
intent nor in our interest to single Croatia out for special 
penalty? 
 
Can Non-Surrender Be Part of Broader Agreement? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6.  (C) Simonovic said Croatia will propose that the 
provisions of the U.S. non-surrender agreement be included in 
a broader document covering legal cooperation, but he said 
that the USG\'s precise language on non-surrender could not be 
included in such an agreement.  Lino was skeptical that an 
MLAT or an extradition treaty could be crafted to address USG 
concerns, but the U.S. would be pleased to consider any 
proposal from the Croatian side; we rejected no 
counterproposal in advance. 
 
Lino: Why We Are Here 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (C) At the broader meeting, Amb. Lino explained the USG\'s 
motivation for seeking a non-surrender agreement.  We seek 
neither immunity nor impunity, but rather protection from 
politically motivated indictments.  Recent cases in Belgium 
reinforce our concern that the U.S., because of its role in 
world affairs, will be an early target of ICC indictments. 
Lino explained in detail the variations we are willing to 
accept in a non-surrender agreement; but the essence of all 
are the same: a promise not to surrender U.S. nationals 
without our consent. 
 
Croatia Values Cooperation with the U.S. 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Simonovic welcomed the Lino delegation, and pointed 
out that the authoritative nature of the GoC delegation 
demonstrated the seriousness with which Croatia took this 
issue.  Croatia is very interested in good relations with the 
U.S., he continued; \"we owe you a lot, and we expect more 
from our future cooperation.\"  He expressed regret that 
Croatia could not have been more supportive on Iraq, but said 
that was changing.  The Racan Cabinet was meeting as the 
delegations talked to approve the deployment of a number of 
Croatian troops to Iraq, Simonovic reported (ref b).  (During 
the discussion, an aide handed Simonovic a note; he 
theatrically announced Cabinet approval for the offer for 
Iraq; Ambassador Rossin expressed appreciation but noted that 
military-to-military talks would determine if the proposed 
Croatian contingent to the Coalition Forces would be useful.) 
 
9.  (C) Deputy Defense Minister Gareljic underscored the 
value Croatia places on the bilateral military relationship. 
Representing the branch of the GoC which will feel the impact 
of ASPA provisions most directly, Gareljic explained the 
importance of U.S. military assistance in Croatia\'s efforts 
to reform its military into a highly-trained, well-equipped 
force that would be interoperable with NATO.  Gareljic 
outlined Croatia\'s contributions to ongoing operations, 
including the deployment of a Croatian MP platoon to 
Afghanistan in support of ISAF and the donation of surplus 
weapons for the fledgling Afghan National Army. 
Lino: \"Your Troops in ISAF Are Protected By Article 98\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
10.  (C) Lino thanked Gareljic for his presentation, but 
pointed out that Croatia\'s troops are in fact operating in 
Afghanistan with far greater protection from ICC prosecution 
than the U.S. seeks in the proposed non-surrender agreement. 
The ISAF agreement (which inter alia protects Croatia\'s MPs) 
is considered an Article 98 agreement under the Rome Statute. 
 Further, there are four Croatian citizens who currently 
serve as members of the U.S. armed forces; without 
protection, they are potential victims of political 
prosecutions. 
 
Existing Agreements Provide Partial Protection 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
11. (C) Andreja Metelko-Zgombic, head of the Foreign 
Ministry\'s International Law Department, described a number 
of existing legal instruments that, she said, already provide 
the protections we seek in an Article 98 agreement to U.S. 
servicemembers.  Multilateral agreements, like the PFP SOFA 
and the Dayton Agreements (which covers NATO forces 
participating in SFOR) provide full immunity, not just a 
non-surrender agreement.  Three bilateral agreements, one 
dating from 1994 protecting U.S. assistance providers, one 
from 2001 (recently extended through 2003) on law enforcement 
cooperation, and now one covering workers implementing a WMD 
assistance instruction, provide protections similar to those 
to administrative and technical workers as described by the 
Vienna Conventions. 
 
Croatia\'s Top Lawyer: A Political, Not Legal Decision 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
12.  (C) Ivo Josipovic, one of Croatia\'s leading jurists and 
a participant at the preparatory conference which finalized 
Qe Rome Statute, outlined the GoC\'s legal objections to 
signing an agreement as proposed by the USG.  Croatia will 
interpret paragraph 2 of Article 98 in accordance with the EU 
guidelines; that means the language proposed by the U.S. is 
too broad.  After an extensive, detailed discussion with Lino 
about how the term \"sending\" can be variously interpreted, 
Josipovic admitted that in the final analysis, lawyers can 
argue valid points from both sides; he agreed (as did 
Simonovic in the pre-meeting), that the decision to choose 
one or the other interpretation is a political decision, 
given the absence of any negotiating record. 
 
Possible GoC Counterproposal 
---------------------------- 
 
13. (C) Josipovic pointed out that the spirit of the proposed 
non-surrender agreement might be embedded in a broader 
document covering legal cooperation; Croatia and the U.S. 
have no current MLAT, and the extradition treaty in force 
dates from 1904.  Josipovic said that the GoC had approached 
him to draft a document which would fit such a description 
and hoped to have it ready soon. 
 
14.  (C) Lino explained that there are serious problems with 
using either MLATs or Extradition Treaties to prevent 
politically-motivated indictments.  Nevertheless, the U.S. 
would be willing to examine any proposal.  Lino agreed that 
the decision to sign a non-surrender agreement is in fact a 
political decision, and she stressed how important these 
agreements are to the President, the Secretary and to the 
Congress.  She urged the Croatians not to lose themselves in 
the technical details of the legal argument, but to focus on 
the broader principles.  Ambassador Rossin added that, the 
GoC side having acknowledged that the whole issue was 
political, not legal, we would watch whether the GoC chose to 
sign or not, i.e. to stick with the EU guidelines and ICTY 
prallels it acknowledged not to be valid, and assess the 
impact on our relations accordingly.  (The Ambassador made 
this point again, even more directly, to Josipovic during a 
luncheon following the meeting.  Josipovic, a close Racan 
confidant, agreed to convey the message.) 
 
15.  (C) Simonovic expressed hope that the U.S. and the EU 
would soon reach agreement on how to move forward with 
Article 98 agreements, and opined that \"this disagreement 
will be exploited by countries which do not share our 
values.\"  Emphasizing the role Croatia plays in promoting 
stability in the region, Simonovic asked about the likelihood 
of a national interest waiver.  Lino was straightforward; 
there has been no decision on any waivers of ASPA provisions 
and Croatia should certainly not count on one. 
 
GoC Manipulates Press Coverage 
------------------------------ 
 
16.  (C) Press interest in the Lino delegation\'s visit was 
high.  Despite the lack of progress, Simonovic declared 
victory for the Croatian side, announcing that Croatia had 
said \"no to the treaty (an Article 98 Agreement), but yes to 
further dialogue.\"  In one instance, his statement bordered 
on fabrication: he claimed that the GoC had actually made a 
proposal whereby accused Americans would be extradited to the 
U.S. and not to the ICC \"in line with both the Rome Statute 
and the EU guidelines.\"  Croatia\'s raucous press picked up 
the theme; one headline read: \"Croatia\'s \'No\' to America,\" 
and leading columnists declared the Lino delegation visit a 
\"diplomatic victory\" for the GoC, since they were able to 
find a way forward.  In the absence of responsible briefings, 
the press is drifting even farther afield, with some 
speculating that a deal trading leniency for ICTY fugitive 
Ante Gotovina for a \"yes\" on an Article 98 Agreement was on 
the table. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
17.  (C) The GoC took the visit of Amb. Lino\'s delegation 
seriously, but the reality is that we are no closer to 
signing an Article 98 agreement than before the June 12 
discussions.  Nor was there any real indication that a GoC 
counterproposal will take into account our fundamental 
desideratum.  We were impressed by the Croatian delegation\'s 
preparation and focus on substantive issues without raising a 
litany of justifications for a waiver.  But we were 
disappointed (predictably) with their spin of the press and 
public opinion.  While they talked and acted seriously, we 
assess that the GoC\'s main aim, to make the public think it 
has put relations with the U.S. back on track, was largely 
attained.  That may of course be ephemeral; July 1 is only 
two weeks away.  But clearly the domestic objective was more 
 
important that the discussion with us, which was foreordained 
to be Kabuki since the GoC had already decided \"no.\"  Until 
the EU changes its stance, we should expect Croatia to remain 
solidly in the \"no\" column; even if the EU changes its 
position, PM Racan\'s ICTY timidity may stall a GoC \"yes.\" 
 
18.  (U) Ambassador Lino\'s delegation cleared this telegram.

CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF MITCH BENEDICT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) POLITICAL OBSERVERS IN ZAGREB BELIEVE THAT CONDITIONS 
MAY SOON BE CREATED WHEREBY ICTY PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA COULD 
SURRENDER TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR FURTHER TRANSFER TO THE 
HAGUE.  THE LOCAL ICTY REPRESENTATIVE TOLD US JUNE 18 THAT 
RECENT MOVES TAKEN BY GOTOVINA HIMSELF AND PRESIDENT MESIC 
COULD BE THE OPENING STEPS IN A SET-PIECE DRAMA WHERE THE 
LAST ACT IS GOTOVINA\'S SURRENDER AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER TO 
ICTY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
EXCHANGE OF LETTERS 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) ON JUNE 12, PRESIDENT MESIC SENT A LETTER TO ICTY 
CHIEF PROSECUTOR CARLA DEL PONTE OFFERING TO GUARANTEE THE 
AVAILABILITY OF PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA IF ICTY WOULD BE WILLING 
TO INTERVIEW HIM AS A \"SUSPECT\" IN ZAGREB RATHER THAN INSIST 
ON HIS TRANSFER TO THE HAGUE.  ALSO ON JUNE 12, MESIC\'S 
OFFICE TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD MADE NEW 
DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE TO PM RACAN\'S CABINET THAT SHOW GOTOVINA 
WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLEANSING OF ETHNIC SERBS FROM 
THE KRAJINA REGION OF CROATIA DURING \"OPERATION STORM.\" 
FRANE KRNIC, HEAD OF THE GOC OFFICE FOR COOPERATION WITH 
ICTY, TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD LONG AGO MADE 
THE DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE TO ICTY. 
 
    3. (C) THOMAS OSARIO, HEAD OF THE ICTY OFFICE IN ZAGREB, 
CONFIRMED TO US THAT THE SIX DOCUMENTS PROVIDED CONTAIN NO 
NEW INFORMATION, BUT WERE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THEY CAME FROM 
THE PRESIDENTIAL ARCHIVES, AND THEY CONTAINED BOTH 
EXCULPATORY AND INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE.  ON JUNE 17 DEL PONTE 
RESPONDED TO MESIC IN A DRY AND FACTUAL LETTER SHE WROTE 
HERSELF IN WHICH SHE GAVE MESIC NO ROOM FOR POLITICAL 
MANEUVERING.  SHE SAID WITHDRAWAL OF THE INDICTMENT IS NOT 
POSSIBLE, AND THE \"ONLY SOLUTION\" IS FOR GOTOVINA TO 
SURRENDER VOLUNTARILY OR BE ARRESTED AND TRANSFERRED TO THE 
HAGUE AND TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COURT.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
GRANIC ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOC WOULD RESPECT THE LAW OF THE 
LAND; IF GOTOVINA PRESENTS HIMSELF, THE GOC WILL HAVE HIM 
ARRESTED, EVEN IF THE ARREST TAKES PLACE AT PANTOVCAK 
(MESIC\'S RESIDENCE). 
 
4. (C) MESIC\'S INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF GOTOVINA HAS GIVEN 
HIM A POLITICAL BOOST, AND WAS A SOLID SWIPE AT THE HDZ\'S 
FIRM GRASP ON THE POLITICAL RIGHT.  THE HDZ HAD USED 
GOTOVINA, WIDELY ACCLAIMED AND ACCEPTED AS A WAR HERO, AS A 
SYMBOL OF OPPOSITION TO COOPERATION WITH ICTY.  WHATEVER THE 
REASONS -- PRESSURE FROM SFOR IN BOSNIA, INTENSIFIED ACTION 
ON THE PART OF THE CROATIAN POLICE, OR THE ARREST OF RAJIC 
AND THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS 
HIDING AND WHO WAS ABETTING IT -- GOTOVINA HAS NOW DELINKED 
HIS FUTURE FROM THE POLITICAL RIGHT AND HAS EFFECTIVELY 
PLACED MESIC AT THE HELM OF HIS DEFENSE.  FOR THE PAST YEAR, 
MESIC HAS BEEN CALLING FOR GOTOVINA TO TURN HIMSELF IN. 
MESIC HAS POSITIONED HIMSELF WELL; BY PICKING UP THE MANTEL 
ON GOTOVINA, HE UNDERCUTS THE MODERATE RIGHT BY PROCLAIMING 
THAT THE HDZ MISUSED GOTOVINA, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE CAN 
    DEMONSTRATE COOPERATION WITH ICTY AND RESPECT FOR THE LAW. 
THE PRESS IS SPECULATING THAT, IF HE SUCCEEDS, MESIC IS NOW 
CERTAIN TO WIN THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 
 
 
5. (C) OSARIO TOLD US THE EXCHANGE OF LETTERS AND THE 
PROVISION OF DOCUMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL ARCHIVES 
(DOCUMENTS FROM THE TUDJMAN ARCHIVES), DESPITE THE FACT THEY 
CONTAIN NO NEW INFORMATION, REPRESENT A SEA CHANGE IN THE 
CASE.  \"WE HAVE GONE FROM A VACUUM TO NOW MOVEMENT,\" HE SAID, 
NOTING THAT GOTOVINA\'S LAWYERS HAVE NEVER ONCE BEEN IN DIRECT 
CONTACT WITH THE ICTY OFFICE.  THE DISCUSSION MAY NOW EVOLVE 
THROUGH THE PRESS, BUT THE MODALITIES OF GOTOVINA\'S ARREST 
AND TRANSFER ARE AT LEAST NOW BEING DISCUSSED.  OSARIO 
DECLINED TO PREDICT WHEN GOTOVINA MIGHT SHOW UP IN THE HAGUE, 
THOUGH HE ASSERTED THAT THERE IS \"NO WAY BACK.\"

SUMMARY 
    ------- 
 
1.   (C) IVO SANADER IS PULLING OUT THE STOPS TO PRESENT HIS 
PARTY AS PRO-WEST AND RESPECTABLE.  HDZ\'S ANNUAL CONVENTION 
TOOK PLACE JUNE 21, AN EVENT SOME EXPECTED TO BE A YAWNER 
SINCE NO PARTY SEATS WERE UP FOR ELECTION.  HDZ PRESENTED 
EX-U.S. CONGRESSMAN GUY VANDER JAGT AS THE CONVENTION\'S 
KEYNOTE SPEAKER.  TO THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE, VANDER JAGT CLAIMED 
THAT IVO SANADER HAD THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, 
IN PARTICULAR, VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY AND SECRETARY RUMSFELD. 
FOR HIS PART, SANADER\'S SPEECH WAS MODERATE IN TONE.  IN 
REMARKS AFTER THE CONVENTION, HE DEFLECTED QUESTIONS ABOUT 
INDICTED WAR CRIMINAL ANTE GOTOVINA.  ACCORDING TO HDZ 
OFFICIALS, TURNOUT AT THE CONVENTION WAS ALMOST 6,000, MUCH 
LARGER THAN LAST YEAR\'S.  SANADER LOOKS TO HAVE CONSOLIDATED 
HIS HOLD ON TUDJMAN\'S OLD PARTY.  THE EMBASSY ISSUED A 
STATEMENT AFTER THE CONVENTION EXPLAINING THAT THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ENDORSE ANY CANDIDATES.  END SUMMARY 
 
U.S. SUPPORTS THE HDZ? 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C) KEEN TO SHOW THAT HDZ IS REFORMING AND HAS 
CREDIBILITY IN THE WEST, PARTY PRESIDENT IVO SANADER ASKED 
GUY VANDER JAGT, FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM MICHIGAN, 
TO DELIVER THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS.  VANDER JAGT -- WHO DELIVERED 
THE NOMINATING SPEECH AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION FOR RONALD 
REAGAN IN 1980 -- TOLD THE THRONG AT ZAGREB\'S CIBONA 
BASKETBALL ARENA THAT MUCH OF WASHINGTON\'S REPUBLICAN 
ESTABLISHMENT WAS BEHIND HDZ.  HE ASSERTED THAT THE 
REPUBLICANS APPRECIATED IN PARTICULAR HDZ\'S SUPPORT ON IRAQ. 
    VANDER JAGT CLAIMED IN HIS SPEECH THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE RUMSFELD AND VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY JUST 
 
SIPDIS 
BEFORE DEPARTING FOR CROATIA.  THE DEFENSE SECRETARY, 
ACCORDING TO VANDER JAGT, TOLD HIM TO DO A GOOD JOB TO HELP 
THE HDZ.  RUMSFELD, HE CLAIMED, EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR 
SANADER\'S SUPPORT ON IRAQ.  REFERRING TO SANADER AS CROATIA\'S 
NEXT PRIME MINISTER, VANDER JAGT CALLED ON HDZ TO SWEEP THE 
CURRENT GOVERNMENT OUT OF OFFICE -- AND, IN SO DOING, HE 
PRESSED ALL THE HOT ECONOMIC AND NATIONALIST BUTTONS. 
 
3.  (C) VANDER JAGT WAS AMONG SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL VIPS 
INVITED.  HE WAS NOT INTRODUCED AS A \"FORMER\" CONGRESSMAN; 
THE CLEAR AIM WAS TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE U.S. 
ADMINISTRATION ENDORSES HDZ AND WANTS TO GET THE CURRENT 
GOVERNMENT OUT OF OFFICE.  THE EX-CONGRESSMAN\'S APPEARANCE 
WAS ARRANGED BY FORMER CROATIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. MIOMIR 
ZUZUL.  IN CONTRAST TO VANDER JAGT AND SEVERAL OTHER EUROPEAN 
SPEAKERS, DORIS PACK, PRESIDENT OF THE EU PARLIAMENT\'S 
COMMISSION FOR SOUTHEAST EUROPE, DELIVERED WHAT WAS LESS OF A 
PEP TALK.  SHE WAS SUBSTANTIVE AND CONVEYED THE FAMILIAR 
THEMES ABOUT CROATIA\'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.  WHEN SHE 
SAID SHE HOPED INDICTED WAR CRIMINAL ANTE GOTOVINA WOULD GO 
TO THE HAGUE, THE AUDIENCE HISSED LOUDLY.  (SANADER DID NOT 
TOUCH ON GOTOVINA IN HIS PREPARED REMARKS, BUT WHEN ASKED 
ABOUT IT IN A SUBSEQUENT HTV INTERVIEW, HE DISSEMBLED: \"IN 
OPPOSITION,\" HE DID NOT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO 
MAKE AN INFORMED JUDGMENT.) 
 
SPIN CONTROL 
------------ 
 
    4.  (C) WE PREPARED PRESS GUIDANCE TO GET OUT THE MESSAGE 
THAT VANDER JAGT\'S VIEWS DID NOT REPRESENT THOSE OF THE USG. 
THE CROATIAN PRESS\'S TRACK RECORD OF FACT CHECKING IS NOT 
GREAT, AND WE WANTED TO BE SURE PEOPLE KNEW VANDER JAGT IS 
NOT CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF CONGRESS.  IN ADDITION, WE REACHED 
OUT TO KEY ADVISORS OF PM RACAN AND PQSIDENT MESIC TO MAKE 
SURE THEY GOT THE WORD.  BOTH ARE FAMOUS FOR LEADING WITH 
THEIR CHINS WHERE THE PRESS IS CONCERNED, AND WE DID NOT WANT 
TO SEE THEM COMMENTING ON REMARKS BY VANDER JAGT, THE FULL 
BACKGROUND OF WHICH THEY DID NOT HAVE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C) FOR HIS PART, SANADER HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE HE 
DEFEATED HARD LINER IVIC PASALIC IN A HOTLY CONTESTED 
LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE A YEAR AGO.  HE HAS CONSOLIDATED HIS BASE 
AND JETTISONED A NUMBER OF THE MORE PROBLEMATIC FIGURES FROM 
POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN THE PARTY.  INDEED, HE KICKED A 
PROMINENT HDZ RIGHT-WINGER, LJUBO CESIC-ROJS, OUT OF THE 
PARTY.  AS ONE COMMENTARY PUT IT AFTER THE CONVENTION, 
HOWEVER, SANADER STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO CONVINCE 
CROATIAN VOTERS -- AS DISTINCT FROM HDZ ACTIVISTS -- THAT HIS 
PARTY ENJOYS INTERNATIONAL RESPECTABILITY.  AND IF THE PARTY 
 
ZAGREB 00001439  002 OF 002 
 
RTNERS, THE DEMOCRATIC 
CENTER (DC) AND THE CROATIAN LIBERAL PARTY (HSLS) SENT SECOND 
TIER REPRESENTATIVES.  THE PEASANTS PARTY (HSS), THE SECOND 
BIGGEST IN THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT -- AND THE WIDELY-REPUTED 
\"KINGMAKER-TO-BE\" -- SENT NOBODY.  HSS HAD BEEN RUMORED FOR 
    MONTHS TO HAVE BEEN FLIRTING WITH HDZ.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Over the last several months in Croatia, 
several pieces of legislation have been introduced which 
seek to regulate the import and cultivation of biotech 
crops and foods.  The embassy and FAS Vienna have 
engaged the government on a number of fronts to stop 
 to stop 
legislation that, in the case of one parliamentary 
proposal, would temporarily ban GM products.  We are 
also trying to soften restrictive measures that are 
contained in two pieces of proposed legislation (the 
Food Law and Law on Protection of Nature).  While the 
government has discarded its earlier intention to ban 
the import and sale of biotech products, it feels, 
probably correctly, that for any law to have chance of 
passing it must follow EU\'s outline for traceability and 
labeling.  In the meantime, the government and importers 
appear to be maintaining an \"informal\" ban on GMOs, 
which is costing U.S. exporters $12-$15 million a year 
in lost soybean sales.  End Summary. 
 
 
Temporary Ban Revisited 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) In early May, we learned that two draft bans 
on GMOs had appeared on the parliamentary agenda.  Both 
drafts were submitted by political parties, not the 
government.  One, a total, indefinite ban on GMOs, was 
proposed by the HSP -- Croatian Party of Rights, a tiny 
far-right party.  Conventional wisdom was that party\'s 
marginal status would preclude the bill from getting 
serious consideration.  The second bill, which called 
for a total ban on the import and sale of GMOs until 
legislation regulating its planting, distribution and 
sale were in place, was introduced by the HSS - the 
Croatian Peasants Party -- the second largest party in 
the ruling coalition. 
 
3.  (SBU) Drawing heavily upon the points used by the 
embassy the first time a ban on GMOs was proposed in 
Fall 2001, we urgently demarched Marijana Petir, 
Spokesperson of the HSS and prominent environmental 
activist (points emailed to EUR/SCE).  The HSP bill was 
voted down.  The HSS bill was voted on and passed its 
first reading, but was taken off of \"urgent procedure\" - 
- which would have meant that it would have become law 
immediately -- and put on the shelf awaiting a second 
reading.  While this allows the HSS to have a campaign 
issue, in reality the bill is unlikely to come up for a 
second reading before parliamentary elections, expected 
in the fall. 
 
We\'ll Protect You! 
------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) Last year the government told the public that 
it would, before the end of the year, pass legislation 
to regulate the import and sale of GMOs.  The government 
told us that it felt the need to address the concerns of 
consumers, meet its obligations to bring its laws into 
line with EU directives, and divert calls for an 
outright ban.  A number of legislative initiatives 
 
dealing with consumer protection, food, and 
environmental issues are under consideration and they 
all touch upon GMOs in some way.  While the government 
did not make its 2002 deadline for biotech legislation, 
it is intent on getting these laws passed by the end of 
the current legislative year, partly to make progress 
with EU accession and partly to have something to show 
the electorate in the Fall (the most likely time for 
parliamentary elections). 
 
Consumer Protection Law 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Last fall, we commented on GM-labeling 
requirements in the draft consumer protection law (ref 
A).  Assistant Minister Spevec assured the Ambassador, 
during a meeting with Minister of Economy Jurcic, that 
she had reviewed the law, agreed with our assessment 
that the labeling requirements went beyond even what the 
EU required, and she had ordered the language be deleted 
(ref B). 
 
6.  (SBU) The legislation finally passed parliament on 
June 4th.  Our preliminary review of the law indicates 
that the Ministry of Economy hedged its position by 
deleting all mention of \"genetically modified\" products. 
Instead, the legislation requires manufacturers to 
provide consumers with information about the existence 
of \"transformed\" products, including transformed 
ingredients and supplements, as well as the type of 
transformation, in accordance with \"subsequent 
regulation.\"  It is unclear whether this is a reference 
to the food law (which is generally considered to be the 
main legislation on labeling), or subsequent 
implementing regulations for the consumer protection 
law. 
 
Law on Protection of Nature 
--------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) This law has passed its first reading and is 
undergoing changes in committee before getting a second 
reading, probably late in June.  We are in the process 
of preparing comments for the Ministry of Environment, 
which is in charge of drafting the law (we have sought 
input from USEU and USDA/W).  We had discussed the law 
in general last fall during the visit of biotech speaker 
Lisa Katic (ref c).  The draft legislation would require 
licenses for the import, transport and introduction into 
the environment, and placing into the market of GMO 
products, principally seed.  Regulation of food and feed 
is specifically deferred to the food law, and GM drugs 
to a future law. 
 
8.  (SBU) Labeling of GM seeds would be required, which 
may not be an issue for the seed companies, since GM 
seed usually attracts a higher price, and is a selling 
point for those that wish to purchase it. 
 
9.  (SBU) Encouragingly, GM seed imports could be 
approved by a shortened procedure if there is enough 
data and experience with release of the product into the 
environment.  Hopefully, this would mean that products 
already approved in the EU (and we would argue, in the 
U.S.) would be quickly approved in Croatia as well. 
 
Food Law 
-------- 
 
10.  (SBU) We regularly raise the issue of biotechnology 
in our discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture, 
 
including in a discussion between the Ambassador and the 
Minister ref D).  When we learned that the draft law was 
soon to be introduced into Parliament, we sent 
preliminary comments on June 4 to the Ministries of 
Agriculture (principal sponsor of the bill), Economy, 
Foreign Affairs, Environment and the advisor to the 
Deputy Prime Minister, and expanded comments June 16th. 
The provisions of the law concerning GMO (covered as a 
\"novel food\" in the draft) and our comments were: 
 
-- Special permits, issued by Ministry of Agriculture, 
will be required to put GM food and feed products on 
market.  The permit should be issued based on a 
scientific opinion of a biotech committee in the new 
food agency (the details of this committee will be 
spelled out by the Minister of Health with consent of 
the Minister of Agriculture in future regulations). 
 
US Embassy Comment: Any \"committee\" system should be 
transparent.  It is important that non-scientific 
prejudices not be allowed to block applications.  We 
encourage the inclusion of industry representative on 
this committee. 
 
-- Novel food can be banned from market entry if it is 
scientifically determined to harm human health.  Novel 
foods may also be temporarily banned if there is 
scientific uncertainty (decision by the Ministry of 
Health with consent the Ministry of Agriculture). 
 
U.S. Embassy Comment: We are concerned that this could 
lead to the non-scientific application of the so-called 
\"precautionary principle\" for novel foods.  There is 
\"scientific uncertainty\" in even the most respected and 
widely applied food safety rules.  The degree of risk is 
what matters, not the fact that risk is present.  All 
foods, additives, processes, etc., contain an element of 
risk.  Why are novel foods being treated under a 
separate regulatory framework?  (Please also see the WTO 
SPS Agreement, Article 5, Paragraphs 1 and 2, to 
determine Croatia\'s international obligations on this 
point.) 
 
-- Novel foods will have to have a label that states 
specific information that informs the consumer about 
differences of novel foods comparing to standard food, 
and about the process of change.  Food containing GMOs 
must be labeled with \"this product contains GMO.\"  Foods 
that derive from GMOs but that do not contain GMOs must 
be labeled as \"this product derives from GMOs.\" 
 
U.S. Embassy Comment: We note that the proposed labeling 
does not convey any health related information.  The 
label will essentially be ideologically-based and will 
not provide consumers with any science-based conclusions 
about the product. 
The labeling provisions will also be technically 
impossible to enforce and will be open to fraud.  For 
example, how will Croatian authorities know if soybean 
oil from Brazil was made from GM soya?  There is no 
reliable scientific method to test soybean oil to 
determine if it has been made from GM plants.  Also, it 
is unclear what the threshold level will be for 
labeling. 
 
Labeling of all foods that are made with GM-derived 
vitamin supplements, GM-derived enzymes (cheese), GM- 
yeasts (beer), etc., is also not feasible and will and 
result in many unintentional violations.  In many 
instances, there is no scientific way of proving whether 
 
foods are derived from GM-plants or bacteria. 
Enforcement of the law will necessarily be very 
selective and aimed at imported products. 
 
However, we note that exempting domestic manufacturers 
from labeling because they are currently widely used or 
because non-GM varieties are not available (as has been 
proposed recently in Parliament) could be a violation of 
the WTO\'s principle of national treatment. 
 
The U.S. Government believes that labeling should convey 
material facts.  We are concerned that requiring 
labeling when there is no material difference in the 
product will lead to discrimination.  We support 
voluntary labeling (such as the \"organic\" label used in 
the United States, or \"GMO-free\") when the manufacturer 
believes that the customer puts a premium on that 
characteristic. 
 
-- Feed containing GMO would have to be labeled 
accordingly, but details will be prescribed by the 
Ministry of Agriculture. 
 
Embassy comment: similar to comment for food. 
 
-- Penalties for the violation of the law are from 
100,000 to 500,000 Kn for a company and 5,000 to 10,000 
Kn for any responsible individual or employee.  (Note: 
currently the exchange rate is approximately 6.5 kunas 
to the dollar.) 
 
U.S. Embassy Comment: These are the highest penalties 
contained in the draft law.  Given the fact that other 
food safety issues are actually harming consumer health 
in Croatia (e.g., trichinosis, lysteria, etc.) it is 
interesting that other violations of the law do not 
result in such strong sanctions. 
 
11.  (SBU) We spoke to Assistant Minister Miroslav Bozic 
shortly after we sent the Ministry preliminary comments. 
He said he generally agreed with our comments, except in 
the areas of labeling and testing.  He believed that 
consumers demand labeling, and fraud in declaration can 
be prohibited.  Bozic appealed for understanding.  He 
noted that Minister Pankretic (who is a member of the 
HSS -- the same party that proposed a ban) has withstood 
considerable pressure from his party in allowing the 
food law to be drafted in a way that \"opens the doors to 
GMOs.\"  Bozic reported that he had appeared on 
television the night before to defend the food law, and 
had to rebut ridiculous arguments such as \"why do we 
need GMOs?\" 
 
12.  (SBU) In this conversation with A/M Bozic, we noted 
that while labeling sounded reasonable in theory, in 
practice, in other European countries, labeling had led 
to a lessening of consumer choice, since \"environmental\" 
NGOs had frightened grocers out of carrying GM products. 
In Croatia, importers of soy products had told us that 
they were not buying US soy beans, because of the fear 
of being stigmatized, yet were buying Argentinean and 
Brazilian soy, much of which was probably GM, despite 
certificates to the contrary (see para 15). 
 
Media Announces Victory for GMOs 
---------------------------------- 
 
13.  (SBU) While the Embassy has a number of concerns 
with the proposed Food Law, the press has proclaimed 
that the legislation will \"open the doors to GMOS.\" 
This has caused a gnashing of teeth from the more 
 
strident NGOs.  A producers\' NGO, the Community of 
Farmers Assembly from Slavonia and Baranja (ZUSSB), held 
a press conference last week to express their shock at 
Government decision to allow import of GM food.  They 
invited consumers not to buy such products and even to 
go a step further by \"throwing\" such products off the 
shelves. 
 
But Victory not in Sight 
------------------------ 
 
14.  (U) Prominent environmental NGO, Zelena Acija 
(a.k.a. Green Action, which is associated with the U.S. 
NGO Earth First), also published a \"black list,\" \"white 
list\" and \"green list\" for foods.  The \"black\" list is 
for companies that could not or would not certify that 
they did not use or import GMOs; the \"white\" list is of 
companies that expressed a desire to be GM-free but 
could not certify all their sources; and, on the \"green\" 
list are companies that feel they could certify their 
GM-free status.  This is the second such attempt by 
Zelena Acija to create such a list.  In a visit last 
year to the food industry committee of the Croatian 
Chamber of Economy, Zelena Akcija\'s activities were 
cited as a factor in the Croatian industry\'s fear and 
distrust of biotech. 
 
15.  (SBU)_ As mentioned above, a major food and feed 
importer told us that it had stopped importing US soy 
products as part of an \"informal ban\" on U.S. products 
which could contain GMOs.  This \"informal ban\" was also 
acknowledged by a Croatian public health official. 
While the Croatian official maintained that soy imports 
from Brazil (the leading source country for soya for 
Croatia) were tested for GMOs in Slovenia, the Croatia 
importer told us that there was no testing being done; 
he and his counterparts simply requested and got \"GM- 
free\" certificates from their suppliers. U.S. soybean 
and soy meal exports to Croatia went from $12-$15 
million annually to zero today.  The decline mirrors the 
adoption of GM-soybeans in the United States. 
 
16.  (U) Prominent weekly magazine Globus conducted a 
poll of 600 respondents to determine the attitudes of 
Croatians towards GMOs.  66 percent said they would not 
accept GMOs in Croatia, and 16 percent said they would 
not mind.  60 percent feared that such food would not be 
properly labeled and only 15 percent said they would buy 
it. 
 
Mission Outreach 
---------------- 
 
17.  (SBU) The Embassy and USDA/Vienna are working 
together to change those numbers, by countering the 
grotesque misinformation campaign against biotech.  As 
mentioned earlier, the Embassy hosted a roundtable with 
a biotech speaker from the grocery industry last fall. 
The speaker also visited associations and government 
officials to answer often-hostile questions.  We sent a 
group of four parliamentarians (two of them from the 
HSS) on a biotech study tour of the U.S. in March (ref 
E).  These parliamentarians, all from farm areas, came 
back more inclined to believe our assurances that the 
environmental and health risks of biotech are minimal. 
We plan a repeat for next year, focusing on some of the 
people most opposed to biotech, including the president 
of Zelena Akcija. 
 
18.  (SBU) In February, USDA/Vienna brought in one of 
the FDA\'s chief regulators, Dr. Jim Maryanski, to give a 
 
lecture at a biotech conference and participate in a 
lunch for regulators and trade groups.  This month, 
USDA/Vienna sponsored Richard Sellers from the American 
Feed Industry to speak at the annual Krmiva feed show -- 
the largest event of this type in the region.  Mr. 
Sellers met with a number of industry representatives 
and described how the U.S. feed industry has taken 
advantage of the current generation of GMO crops.  The 
Embassy currently seeks funding to help a local biotech 
ally (the head of the Croatian Association of Bio- 
geneticists and a passionate critic of \"junk science\") 
produce a home-grown pro-biotech public information 
pamphlet. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
19.  (SBU) It is tempting to look at the headlines 
decrying the \"opening of Croatia to GMOs\" and declare 
victory.  Unfortunately, it would be illusory.  It is 
difficult to see a breakthrough soon.  The chances of 
Croatia passing laws that depart from EU norms on GM 
labeling and licensing are negligible.  If the current 
proposed laws pass, most if not all grocers and food 
producers may well be afraid to source and sell biotech 
products because of public perceptions and threats of 
NGO protests in their stores.  And the status quo -- no 
restrictions on paper yet an informal but effective 
shunning of U.S. products  is hurting U.S. farm 
exports.

SUBJECT: GOC APPROVES HOUSING MEASURES AIMED AT 
FACILITATING REFUGEE RETURNS 
 
REF: A. (A) STATE 96439 
 
     B. (B) ZAGREB 1084 
 
Classified By: Darren Taylor, Political Officer, For Reasons: 1.5 (B) a 
nd (D). 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) In what is being viewed as an abrupt change of policy, 
the Croatian Government on June 12 finally approved measures 
aimed at providing subsidized housing to refugees who enjoyed 
\"tenancy rights\" under the old Yugoslav system.  In another 
development, Prime Minister Racan, for the first time, 
publicly called for all refugees to return to Croatia.  The 
GOC,s pursuit of EU membership -- and the EU,s linkage of 
progress on return-related issues as a condition for 
membership -- is the driving force behind recent GOC actions. 
 The proof will be in the implementation.  Senior GOC 
officials, unfortunately, are already declaring the mission 
accomplished -- characteristically confusing statements of 
intention with implementation.  End Summary. 
 
What A Difference A Day Makes 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) After three years of ignoring, rebuffing and attacking 
IC insistence that it address the issue of lost 
occupancy/tenancy rights (OTR) affecting the ability of tens 
of thousands of refugees to return to Croatia, the SDP-led 
coalition Racan government on June 12 dramatically reversed 
its previous policy and announced a new initiative to provide 
housing assistance to refugees who had enjoyed OTR and who 
want to return.  The government previously insisted that OTR 
had been abolished as a legal instrument in Croatia and 
therefore that no effort would be made to offer any special 
assistance (never mind compensation) to the tens of thousands 
of refugees -- by one estimate, up to 100,000 ethnic Serbs -- 
who lost OTR when Croatia\'s law was changed after they had 
fled Croatia, often under duress, in the mid-nineties. 
 
3. (C) Following Cabinet approval of the new initiative, 
Prime Minister Racan took center stage and publicly welcomed 
refugees to return to Croatia during a nationwide television 
broadcast.  (Racan had rejected making such a public appeal 
ever since entering office in early 2000, citing domestic 
political considerations.)  In this first-ever public, 
personal invitation, Racan told the TV audience that, by 
adopting the housing program, the GOC had removed a key 
political obstacle to EU membership.  \"Housing is no longer 
an obstacle for refugees seeking to return to Croatia,8 he 
said. 
 
GOC Highlights Housing Policy 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In their public announcements and in a presentation to 
the Zagreb diplomatic corps, GOC officials described the new 
initiative as an effort to facilitate the return of refugees, 
not restore OTR to all individuals and families who lost 
them.  Under the new housing plan, which the GOC promised to 
begin implementing within 30 days, there will be two options 
for potential returnees. 
 
--  Subsidized rent of state-owned apartments.  Under this 
program, returnees would be eligible to receive subsidized 
rent (less than one dollar per square meter) for apartments 
that will be bought by the State or built through the 
state-subsidized housing program. 
 
--  Direct purchase of property.  Refugees who are 
financially able to pay the down payment (usually 10-30 
percent of the actual cost of a home or apartment) will 
receive low interest rate loans under the program. 
 
5. (C) GOC officials stressed that only former OTR holders 
who seek to return to Croatia and who do not own homes in 
Croatia or any of the former Yugoslav republics will be 
eligible to participate in the program.  The program will 
include cities both inside and outside of the war-affected 
areas (so-called \"Areas of Special State Concern\").  The GOC 
said it plans to spend USD 70 million toward the effort next 
year and complete the reconstruction program by 2006. 
Roughly half of this amount will come from the state budget. 
Both Deputy PM Linic and Deputy FM Simonovic assured the 
Ambassador that funds have been reserved for this program. 
The GOC plans to apply for loans from the Council of Europe 
Bank to cover the remaining balance. 
 
EU Membership Driving Force Behind GOC Action 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The EU,s decision to link Croatia,s progress on 
refugee returns to its eventual membership in the EU is 
 
 
driving the GOC effort.  In its March report, the EC 
Commission specifically set a benchmark for the GOC:  to 
develop and implement an acceptable plan to restore OTR for 
those who lost such rights after fleeing during the war.  The 
Commission gave the GOC until the end of the year to show 
measurable progress on this and two other key impediments to 
return: property restitution and processing applications for 
reconstruction assistance.  The clear message was that the 
GOC must act to enable and facilitate minority returns or 
face a negative avis next spring on its EU membership 
application.  The linkage is the only powerful lever 
available to the IC to force the GOC to take what it 
considers unpopular and costly steps to facilitate mostly 
Serb returns.  Early signs are that the GOC is bending under 
this EU pressure, which the USG has both spurred and 
endorsed. 
 
No Time to Celebrate 
-------------------- 
 
7. (C) The GOC has a history of making promises and not 
following through.  The Ambassador has underscored that we 
will be looking at implementation as the true test of the 
government\'s commitment -- a message he conveyed again to the 
Prime Minister on June 26.  Whether or not the GOC fully 
implements the program just announced will send a clear 
signal about its readiness to \"clear the hurdle\" on refugee 
returns.  While the GOC appears to have gotten the message 
from the EU that resolving refugee returns will weigh heavily 
on Croatia,s bid for membership, the same holds true for 
NATO membership -- a point which the Croatians need to be 
reminded of at every opportunity (Ref). 
 
8. (C) Finally, despite the rather celebratory spirit 
displayed by many GOC officials over the recent initiative, 
another cloud hangs over Croatia: the case a former tenancy 
right holder brought to the European Court of Human Rights in 
Strasbourg.  Scores of other similar cases loom too.  The GOC 
could be on the hook to compensate -- at enormous cost -- all 
former tenancy rights holders, not just those who return to 
Croatia to live.  Indeed, the proposed GOC program is not a 
final resolution to the issue of OTR.  The EU holds that 
rulings by the Strasbourg court must be respected -- a 
central obligation of any country which aspires to EU 
membership.  The OSCE is also following these cases closely.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ON JULY 2 AMBASSADOR FRANK TOLD PRESIDENT MESIC AND FM 
PICULA THAT THE U.S. WOULD WORK WITH THE GOC TO PROMOTE 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, REFORMS OF THE ECONOMY, AND CROATIAN 
MEMBERSHIP IN NATO AND THE EU.  HE CAUTIONED THAT THE GOC 
MUST COOPERATE WITH THE ICTY AND WORK TO RESOLVE RETURNS 
    ISSUES.  AMBASSADOR FRANK SUGGESTED THAT THE GOC COULD DO 
MORE TO IMPROVE COORDINATION ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE GWOT. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
MEETING WITH FM PICULA 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) DURING AN INTRODUCTORY CALL ON JULY 2, AMBASSADOR 
FRANK AND FM PICULA EXCHANGED VIEWS ON THE STATE OF 
U.S.-CROATIA RELATIONS.  PICULA REVIEWED THE FOREIGN POLICY 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAD 
REMAINED REMARKABLY STABLE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.  THE 
COALITION\'S AGENDA WAS AMBITIOUS AND BEGINNING TO BEAR FRUIT, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE ECONOMIC SECTOR.  PICULA EMPHASIZED THE 
IMPORTANCE TO CROATIA OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU AND NATO.  HE 
WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U.S. AND CROATIA WOULD CONTINUE THEIR 
CLOSE COOPERATION, BUILDING ON PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  U.S. 
AND EU SUPPORT TO ACHIEVING CROATIA\'S FOREIGN POLICY GOALS 
WAS ESSENTIAL.  PICULA SAID THAT RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF CLOSE 
COOPERATION BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BRUSSELS WAS CRUCIAL. 
 
3. (C) AMBASSADOR FRANK NOTED CROATIA\'S MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
AND AGREED THAT THERE WAS MORE YET TO BE DONE.  IN THIS 
REGARD, THE U.S. FULLY SUPPORTED THE GOC\'S ASPIRATIONS FOR EU 
AND NATO MEMBERSHIP.  THE U.S. CERTAINLY WAS NOT ASKING 
CROATIA TO CHOOSE BETWEEN NATO AND THE EU.  HE NOTED THAT THE 
GOC MUST COMPLY WITH THE ICTY, ACCOMMODATE ALL RETURNEES, 
NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, REFORM THE 
JUDICIAL SECTOR AND CONTINUE BUILDING A MARKET ECONOMY. 
WHILE CROATIA HAD BEEN HELPFUL IN THE GWOT, IT COULD DO MORE. 
 AS AN INDICATION OF OUR COMMITMENT, THE U.S. HAD TO DATE 
    PROVIDED $285 MILLION IN ASSISTANCE TO CROATIA.  AMBASSADOR 
FRANK EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING PRIVATE 
COMMUNICATIONS TO DISCUSS POTENTIALLY DIVISIVE ISSUES. 
 
4.  (C) PICULA SAID HE WOULD RAISE THE AMBASSADOR\'S POINTS 
WITHIN THE CABINET, ESPECIALLY ON CLOSER COOPERATION IN THE 
GWOT.  HE ALSO PLEDGED THAT HE WOULD NOT RAISE DIVISIVE 
BILATERAL ISSUES IN THE PRESS. 
 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MESIC 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) FOLLOWING HIS PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS ON JULY 2, 
AMBASSADOR FRANK MET PRIVATELY WITH PRESIDENT MESIC AND TWO 
SENIOR ADVISORS.  THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE SAME ISSUES WITH 
MESIC WHO SAID HE WOULD \"FIX\" THE SHORTCOMINGS IN GWOT 
COOPERATION.  HE ALSO PLEDGED TO WORK PRIVATELY WITH THE U.S. 
TO RESOLVE CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT BOTH PICULA AND MESIC TOOK A 
VERY POSITIVE TONE IN THESE MEETINGS AND HAVE CLEARLY 
RECOGNIZED THE SHORTCOMINGS OF DEALING WITH THE USG IN THE 
PRESS RATHER THAN USING PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.S.  WE 
PLAN TO TEST THESE COMMITMENTS IN COMING WEEKS WITH BOTH THE 
PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER.

SUBJECT: APPLICATIONS FOR FY2003 AMBASSADOR\'S FUND FOR 
REFUGEES 
 
REF: STATE 66319 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. We are pleased to submit two applications to 
PRM,s Ambassador,s Refugee Fund Program aimed at providing 
support to refugee communities.  The first request is to 
provide resource support (totaling about 7,000 USD) to a 
community center and primary school in Centingrad, a town 
with a sizeable Muslim population, many of whom are returnees 
to Croatia.  The second request is to provide various types 
of medical/surgical equipment to Knin hospital (totaling 
about 13,000 USD), which provides important medical services 
to thousands of refugees who have returned to the area.  We 
have visited the community center and school in Centingrad, 
which is currently under construction by a joint team of U.S. 
and Croatian military officers and the Knin hospital in 
recent weeks.  An Embassy panel, chaired by the DCM, 
determined that these projects, out of a list of twelve, were 
the ones where PRM funds would have the greatest impact on 
refugee returns and the community at large.  End Summary. 
 
 
Panel Selects Projects for PRM Program 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. Following extensive research on a dozen projects submitted 
for consideration for PRM,s Ambassador,s Fund Program, the 
DCM recently convened a panel to review the list of proposed 
projects and to make final selections.  Panel members agreed 
that supporting the projects in the town of Centingrad and in 
the city of Knin would yield the most benefit.  Both are 
projects that will benefit refugee populations and the entire 
community at large.  They will continue to support 
reconciliation efforts that are underway.  In addition, both 
are very specific in nature and will require little effort 
with implementation.  Post has reviewed and confirmed the 
estimated prices of the equipment that has been requested, 
and is confident that the prices will fit within the $20,000 
cap set by PRM.  Post will play a direct role in overseeing 
the purchases and delivery of the requested items. 
Background material on each project is provided below. 
 
A Muslim Community in Croatia 
------------------------------ 
 
3. The town of Centingrad is located about two hours from 
Zagreb by car.  The town, which consisted of 4,800 residents 
prior to the war and had an ethnic makeup of 66 percent 
Croat, 25 percent Serb, and 9 percent Muslim, was heavily 
damaged.  Since 1998, refugee returns to the town have 
increased as more houses are being reconstructed and 
infrastructure is repaired.  The population now stands at 
about 2,500, with Croats making up 78 percent of the 
population, and Serbs and Muslims the balance.  Muslims are 
now the second largest ethnic group due to an increase in 
returns.  The town has received very little support from the 
Croatian Government.  It has one of the largest Muslim 
communities in Croatia. 
 
4. We recently met with the local Imam, Azim Durmic, and the 
president of the school, Matija Stepic, who told us that the 
two most important needs for the community were at the 
primary school and community center.  The school in 
Centingrad had been completely destroyed, forcing many of the 
town,s almost fifty children to travel some fifteen miles to 
attend school in a neighboring municipality.  But help is on 
the way, primarily due to assistance from the United States. 
The Imam boasted about the fact that USAID is providing some 
assistance helping to restore electricity, and U.S. and 
Croatian military personnel were currently reconstructing the 
primary school.  Construction will be completed by August 1. 
 
5. Stepic told us that the school will need about 100 
compulsory school literature books, 3-4 computers, a 
television, videocassette recorder, and sports equipment for 
outdoor sports before it opens.  USG assistance with the 
above-mentioned items would be appreciated.  We later visited 
the construction site of the school and spoke with the U.S. 
military commander in charge of the project who confirmed the 
timeframe for completion.  The estimated cost of providing 
the items the school requested is $6,000. 
 
6.  As for the community center, Imam Duric explained that it 
is a place where all of the citizens gather to read or 
complete paperwork for citizenship papers or to apply for 
various types of social assistance.  Based in a three-storied 
house, we noticed that the community center is indeed the 
gathering place for adults and children.  The Imam said that 
because of the various roles the community center plays, it 
 
 
would be useful for it to have a medium-sized copier to 
complete various types of paperwork and a television and 
videocassette recorder so that the children could watch 
various educational and other shows during summer months and 
after school.  The estimated cost of these items is 
approximately $1,000. 
 
Knin Hospital In Need of Help 
----------------------------- 
 
7. The city of Knin was the capital of the so-called &Serb 
Krajina8 prior to the war.  During this period, Knin had a 
predominantly Serb population and its hospital was considered 
one of the best in Croatia.  However, the effects of the war 
and the virtual neglect by the Croatian government since the 
war have taken a severe toll on the hospital,s operations 
over the past eight years.  Although the ethnic balance in 
Knin has changed (it is now roughly 65 percent Croat and 35 
percent Serb after a significant infusion of Bosnian Croats 
who were resettled in the region after Serbs fled their 
homes), many Serbs are returning to Knin and the hospital 
continues to provide services to all of Knin,s citizens. 
 
8. We traveled to Knin to meet with the manager of the 
hospital, Anka Shihabi.  She told us that the hospital was 
built twenty years ago and equipped to provide medical 
services to 350 patients.  The hospital,s medical equipment, 
infrastructure, and information technology was heavily 
destroyed during the war.  There are four main departments -- 
medical, surgical, gynecological, and pediatric -- currently 
operating at the hospital.  The hospital currently has 140 
employees, including many Serbs, and has almost 100 patients. 
 In the gynecology department, over 300 women, many of whom 
are returning refugees, from Knin give birth per year.  Other 
refugees receive critical services including minor and major 
surgery, from the hospital daily even though they are not 
able to pay. 
 
9. Shihabi told us that the Knin hospital continues to be one 
of the most important preconditions for sustainable return 
and living in the Knin area.  This is because the hospital 
also provides services to refugees in several other 
municipalities outside Knin.  The next closest hospital is 
located almost an hour away in Sibenik.  Shihabi indicated 
that the hospital was in dire need of basic medical equipment 
needed to perform various types of surgical procedures.  She 
provided us with a list of about 40 pieces of equipment 
ranging from various types of tweezers and scissors to 
different types of scalpels.  She had received estimates for 
the equipment, which totaled about $13,000.  Providing this 
equipment would allow the hospital to continue to provide 
services to all of Knin,s residents.  She noted that these 
items were the most pressing need for the hospital and 
appealed to the U.S. for help.

SKRACIC PROVIDED A DEFINITIVE RESPONSE TO OUR POSITION ONLY 
ON JULY 2.  SKRACIC ASKED THAT WE CONSIDER CAREFULLY BEFORE 
DISENGAGING FROM THE MULTINATIONAL ADVISORY GROUP (MAG).

SUBJECT: PRODI IN CROATIA: ENCOURAGEMENT FOR EU BID AND 
THANKS FOR NOT SIGNING ARTICLE 98 
 
 
1.  On July 10, EC President Romano Prodi visited Croatia to 
present the Commission\'s membership \"questionnaire\" to PM 
Racan.  In meetings with President Mesic, PM Racan\'s Cabinet 
and an address to the Croatian parliament as well as in 
meetings with religious leaders and opposition parties, Prodi 
encouraged Croatia to continue its efforts toward membership. 
 Prodi said Croatia has made \"noticeable progress\" and that 
the question of EU membership for Croatia is \"no longer if, 
but when and how.\" 
 
2.  Prodi dispelled the persistent public misconception that 
the EU will support Croatia\'s membership only as part of a 
regional grouping of Balkan countries.  Nevertheless, he made 
a strong appeal for regional cooperation and for Croatia to 
use its front-running position to help other states in the 
region make progress toward the EU.  He made clear that much 
work remains ahead and that no aspect of the public sector 
will be unaffected as the GoC moves along the \"arduous but 
exhilarating road to membership.\" 
 
3.  Prodi hit all the right notes when urging progress toward 
reform: he commended Croatia\'s progress in some fields, but 
called for further efforts in reform of the judiciary, 
freedom of the media, respect for minority rights and the 
return of refugees.  Prodi told the press and parliament 
(full text of Prodi\'s address at para 5 below) that some of 
the more than 2500 \"questions\" in the document he handed to 
the GOC addressed cooperation with ICTY.  He said that full 
compliance is essential, and added that only the UN and the 
ICTY itself can judge Croatia\'s level of cooperation; the EC 
will base its judgment on whether Croatia is in cooperation 
based solely on their evaluation.  Reactions of all of 
Croatia\'s leadership were identical: Croatia is committed to 
do whatever it takes to move forward as quickly as possible 
towards membership.  After the opposition\'s meeting with 
Prodi, even Ivo Sanader, President of the right-wing HDZ, 
said that he was \"absolutely\" for full cooperation with the 
Hague. 
 
Prodi Thanks Croatia For Saying \"No\" to Article 98 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4.  For us, the major sour note was Prodi\'s very public 
message of thanks to the GoC for refusing to sign an Article 
98 agreement with the U.S.  In his address to parliament, his 
meetings with President Mesic and PM Racan, and in the press, 
Prodi praised Croatia for standing up to pressure.  \"I know 
that by not signing one (non-surrender agreement) Croatia 
made a sacrifice and I am grateful for that.  Because of 
that, Croatia will not be forgotten.\" 
 
Text of Prodi Address to the Croatian Parliament 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5.  Begin text of EC President Prodi\'s July 10 address to the 
Croatian parliament: 
 
President, Honorable Members, 
 
On 21 February the Croatian authorities delivered the 
country\'s application for membership to the Greek Presidency 
in Athens. 
 
I believe there are few acts in a country\'s history that can 
have such far-reaching implications. 
 
By submitting that application, Croatia has reaffirmed its 
European vocation. And by the same token it has declared that 
the long and trying period of war, division and nationalism 
is well and truly over. 
 
That application demonstrated Croatia\'s determination to look 
to the future as it sets off along the arduous but 
exhilarating road to membership. 
 
I heard the news in Skopje, which I was visiting at the time, 
and I warmly welcomed the membership application. 
 
I was convinced, and I still am, that it marked a critical 
turning point for Croatia and set a very important example 
for all the other countries in the region. 
 
So I am very happy that I will be shortly handing over to the 
Croatian authorities a comprehensive, wide-ranging document, 
technically termed a \"questionnaire.\" 
 
This questionnaire contains over 2,500 questions on the 
political, economical and administrative situation in the 
country.  The answers will form the basis for the 
Commission\'s opinion on the starting of accession 
negotiations. 
 
 
Our journey together starts today and in some years\' time it 
will take Croatia into the European Union. A Union that is 
enlarging and growing stronger, that will soon have a 
Constitution, the result of intense debate between 
governments, parliaments and the public. 
 
And today I am here to share in the emotion, the expectation 
and anticipation this great journey evokes. 
 
It is a journey of mutual discovery. 
 
In the coming months we will discover more about each other. 
We will learn more about each other\'s systems and we will see 
how compatible they are. We will adapt our instruments and 
procedures, and this harmonisation process will mean we will 
soon share the same rules. 
 
Our fellow citizens will get to know each other better, to 
understand where we come from -- our different histories, 
cultures and traditions -- and how we have got where we are 
today. 
 
We will learn to live side by side in a Union of diversity 
and minorities, because no Member State of the Union is large 
enough to take decisions alone without coordinating them with 
the others. 
 
This factor has become a distinctive trait of Europe, where 
respect, tolerance and the search for consensus are the rule. 
Where coercion is outlawed. Where dialogue has replaced 
diatribe. Where shared rules, worked out in common and 
decided jointly, are the foundation for life within the Union. 
 
It means bringing legislation and implementation of new rules 
into line with the Union\'s standards. 
No sector of administrative life will remain unaffected by 
this process of adaptation to EU rules. 
 
And yet all the countries that have gone through this 
strenuous and at times painful process have come out 
stronger, with a hugely enhanced capacity to meet the 
challenges of international life. 
 
This is true of all countries in the Union, from the founding 
members to those that are still to become full members. It 
involves a process of continual growth and constant 
adaptation. 
 
The whole country must help in this complex and delicate 
process. 
 
All society, all Croatians -- both men and women -- need to 
speak out loud and clear in favour of membership. The 
institutions must rise to the challenge and give guidance, 
with all the enthusiasm, patience and determination they can 
muster. 
 
Parliament, and you, Honourable Members, have a special 
responsibility, since it is your task to legislate and 
support the reform process politically. 
 
This is my earnest hope and appeal to you. 
 
Keep your eyes fixed firmly on your country\'s interest and 
its aspiration to join the great European family of nations. 
 
That was what you did in December last year when you voted 
unanimously in favour of a resolution supporting Croatia\'s 
application to join the European Union. 
 
That spirit of unity is a great strength, particularly given 
the range of opinions that is typical of a democratic society. 
 
That spirit of unity, based on a shared European ambition, 
will be vital in tackling the problems and issues that have 
to be resolved to complete the membership process. 
 
The country\'s political, economic, legal and administrative 
transition was a huge challenge for Croatia. 
 
You met that challenge successfully on several counts, but 
further effort is needed in areas such as the reform of the 
judicial system, freedom of the media, respect for minority 
rights and the return of the refugees. It calls for a major 
effort on the sensitive issue of cooperation with the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. 
 
Your country has already shown it can make tough choices in 
the name of the European idea. I am thinking of the 
International Criminal Court, where Croatia has decided to 
align itself on the Union\'s Common Position and back the 
authority of an institution that will act as a safeguard for 
 
 
all members of the international community. 
 
This is the basis for building a future together in Europe: 
it means sharing the same vision and creating the tools to 
build it. 
 
President, Honourable Members, 
 
Only a few days ago we met in Thessaloniki for a summit that 
marked a crucial turning point for the region. 
 
On that occasion the members of the European Council solemnly 
declared that the Balkan countries\' future is in the European 
Union. At the same time they stressed the Union\'s firm 
support for the integration of the Balkans into the Union. 
 
Before this House, I want to repeat my full and firm support 
for integrating the Balkans into the European Union. 
 
And I will never tire of repeating that Europe\'s unification 
can never be regarded as complete until all the countries in 
the region are full members of the Union. 
 
The political agenda agreed at Thessaloniki is a joint 
commitment and it charts the course we intend following 
together. 
 
We have bolstered the Stabilisation and Association Process 
by including the salient aspects of the enlargement strategy. 
 
We have stepped up political dialogue. 
 
We have put the stress on the problems of growth and economic 
development, because we are convinced that growth and 
employment are the most effective ways of combating poverty 
and social exclusion, the breeding ground for crime and 
illegal trafficking. 
 
The Union is ready to do its part and the Commission is keen 
to get on with the work before it. 
 
But this is a two-way street. 
 
You need to show the same enthusiasm and determination. 
Indeed, the pace and tempo of integration will be set by you. 
 
The Union\'s rules are clear: respect for the Copenhagen 
political criteria, a functioning market economy and the 
capacity to adapt to the rules and regulations of EU law. 
 
The Union asks for no more. But it will accept no less. 
 
For my part, I am certain Croatia can rise to the challenge. 
 
Your country also has a special responsibility, because at 
present Croatia is in the forefront. It is for you to \"set a 
good example\" and show that the goal can be reached if the 
political will is there and you are ready to follow in the 
footsteps of Europe\'s founding fathers. 
 
President, Honourable Members, 
 
I want to stress how important it is never to lose sight of 
the regional reference framework. 
 
The whole - I repeat, the whole - of the Balkans must come 
into the European Union. 
 
No wall, no barrier must divide the Balkans. That would be 
unthinkable. We know only too well how much suffering such 
divides have caused. 
 
There is no nostalgia for the past in what I am saying. 
 
Just the profound conviction that it is time to build bridges 
in the Balkans, not destroy them. To open borders, not to 
close them. To restore relations and trade links, not to 
sever them. 
 
It is no coincidence that regional and subregional 
initiatives are thriving in the region. Like the Stability 
Pact, the South-East Europe Cooperation Process, the Central 
European Initiative and the Adriatic-lonian Initiative. And 
agreements too, such as the Memorandum of Understanding on 
the Regional Electricity Market in South-East Europe and the 
Framework Agreement on the Sava River Basin. And the network, 
now complete, of bilateral free-trade agreements between all 
the countries in the region. 
 
Development, stability and security call for a regional 
approach. No country can regard itself as free from the risk 
of instability if the others are not free from that risk too. 
 
Naturally, this does not mean that Croatia will have to wait 
until every other country is ready to join before it becomes 
a member. 
The principle of differentiation will continue to apply and 
each country will be judged on its own merits and capacities. 
 
But the process of enlargement for the Balkan countries is 
one and indivisible. And ultimately the region as a whole 
must be fully integrated into the Union. 
 
President, Honourable Members, 
 
Let me close by reminding you of a date: 24 November 2000. 
 
That day, here in Zagreb I attended a Summit that launched 
the process of integrating the Balkan countries into Europe. 
 
That Summit also marked the start of talks between the 
European Union and Croatia on our Stabilisation and 
Association Agreement. 
 
At the time I was full of hope that Croatia would make fast 
progress towards European integration. 
 
Today I am sure your country has really started on the 
journey that will take it into the European Union as a full 
member. 
 
To je vasa i nasa zajedicka buducnost. 
 
Hvala lijepo.

SUBJECT: POLITICS, POLITICS: AMBASSADOR\'S INITIAL CALL ON 
PARLIAMENT SPEAKER TOMCIC 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The opposition-leading HDZ party will remain strong 
after parliamentary elections this November, but it will not 
be able to form a government; Croatia\'s next coalition 
government will be largely similar to the current lineup of 
parties, Parliament Speaker Zlatko Tomcic confidently 
predicted during his first meeting with the Ambassador. 
Tomcic declared that, right up until the beginning of the 
formal campaign period, the ruling coalition will remain 
focused on driving forward with Croatia\'s top policy 
priorities: integration into the EU and NATO.  The Ambassador 
applauded the coalition\'s consensus on key goals and 
reaffirmed U.S. support for Croatia\'s eventual accession into 
Euro-Atlantic institutions.  There is strong agreement within 
the international community that Croatia must continue to 
make progress on reform; concrete achievements in key areas 
will help Croatia\'s progress toward both NATO and the EU. 
End Summary. 
 
Tomcic: Looking Forward to Close Relationship 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) On July 22, the Ambassador paid his initial call on 
Parliament (Sabor) Speaker Zlatko Tomcic.  Tomcic was eager 
to establish a close working relationship with the Ambassador 
similar to the one he enjoyed with former Ambassador Rossin. 
Despite the formal elegance of the Sabor\'s reception rooms, 
Tomcic was open and informal about political challenges 
facing the coalition and his Croatian Peasants\' Party (HSS). 
He apologized for not being able to meet with the Ambassador 
in the first days following his arrival in Croatia, 
explaining that official visits by two heads of state (Israel 
and Turkey) and the press of business now before the 
parliament relating to EU accession made scheduling difficult. 
 
Tomcic: We\'re Focused on EU/NATO Accession 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) Tomcic declared that both the Government and the 
Parliament\'s majority are in full agreement on Croatia\'s top 
policy priorities: integration into the EU and NATO. 
Parliament passed legislation on defense reform and a law to 
restructure Croatia\'s intelligence services to support the 
Government\'s bid for NATO membership.  The process of 
bringing Croatia\'s legislation into line with EU standards is 
an intense, ongoing process, but the parliament\'s unanimous 
declaration in September 2002 supporting Croatia\'s membership 
application demonstrated Croatia\'s commitment, said Tomcic. 
He complained bitterly about the opposition\'s \"destructive, 
selfish\" actions in the last two months to boycott voting in 
the Sabor for political reasons.  Tomcic said that he is 
certain that the EU and NATO will judge Croatia\'s suitability 
for membership not only by formal criteria, but also by the 
behavior of the political opposition.  Fortunately, Tomcic 
pointed out, the government enjoys an extraordinary level of 
public support for its accession goals. 
 
4.  (C) Tomcic said that much of the work the parliament is 
doing to help Croatia progress towards the EU and NATO goes 
on behind the scenes, particularly its work to reach out to 
other parliaments in the region.  Croatia knows it cannot 
progress in a vacuum: a stable and prosperous Croatia can 
only exist in a stable and prosperous region.  Tomcic said 
that, since Croatia may be several steps ahead of some states 
in the region, it can serve as an example of how to move 
forward. 
 
Ambassador: Croatia Has Lots Of Work To Do 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) The Ambassador welcomed Tomcic\'s commitment to EU and 
NATO membership and said that the U.S. remains committed to 
helping Croatia achieve these goals.  He hailed the broad 
support for these goals among Croatia\'s political leaders, 
but explained that there is also broad consensus within the 
international community that Croatia has important reform 
work still to achieve.  The international community agrees 
that for EU and NATO accession, Croatia must make concrete 
progress on key issues, including refugee return, judicial 
reform, ICTY cooperation and regional relations.  U.S. 
assistance programs are directed toward helping Croatia 
achieve these goals.  Tomcic expressed appreciation for the 
Ambassador\'s support and also for the significant commitment 
of U.S. assistance to Croatia since the change in government 
in January 2000. 
 
Privatization: HSS Pressing For Changes to Law 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.  (C) Responding to the Ambassador\'s question about the 
politically sensitive issue of privatization, Tomcic claimed 
that the disparity between his party\'s view and that of PM 
Racan\'s SDP has been exaggerated by Croatia\'s irresponsible 
media.  Under the Tudjman regime, the privatization process 
was an opportunity for \"their people\" to get rich by taking 
public property.  While the current government has done much 
better, Tomcic expressed regret that it has not made as much 
progress as the public had hoped.  Not a single large-scale 
privatization has taken place without \"incident,\" Tomcic 
complained.  Tomcic said that the SDP and the HSS have now 
agreed on a way forward (according to an HSS model), and that 
a new law on privatization would be presented to parliament 
in September.  Tomcic brought up the recent privatization of 
25 percent of INA, Croatia\'s state-owned energy company, and 
declared that he is convinced that this process was \"very 
correct,\" and that there would be no \"dirty laundry\" 
discovered, despite what might be alleged in the press. 
 
Sabor to Work Overtime to Keep Election Campaign Short 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7.  (C) The Ambassador steered the conversation toward 
electoral politics, and asked how the parliament\'s work would 
be affected by the campaign.  Tomcic said that an election 
date in late November had been agreed to with key coalition 
partners, but that would not stop him from keeping the 
parliament at work.  He told the Ambassador that he had 
already announced an extraordinary session from September 9 - 
15, which means that the Sabor will be in session 
continuously until the middle of October, focused almost 
entirely on the EU accession agenda.  Tomcic expressed hope 
that the official campaign period will be kept as short as 
possible in order to keep conflicts between parties to a 
minimum and also to keep the costs of campaigning -- which 
are by law covered primarily by the state budget -- as low as 
possible. 
 
Election Prediction: Return of Our Coalition 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Tomcic predicted that the opposition HDZ would be the 
leading vote-getter in the next election, but was confident 
that it would not be able to attract enough support from 
other parties to form a government.  The SDP would fare well, 
but would get \"slightly fewer\" seats in the next parliament. 
He expected his own HSS to do slightly better than the 16 
seats (about ten percent of the total) it holds in the 
current Sabor, but the Croatian People\'s Party (HNS) would 
also see a sharp improvement. 
 
9.  (C) Tomcic said that, since the SDP, HSS and HNS will 
probably not have quite enough seats to form an absolute 
majority, the coalition will have to rely on those MPs which 
will fall outside of the two \"blocs.\"  Tomcic said he expects 
that the next Sabor will have as many as 15 MPs from smaller 
or regional parties, fully eight MPs representing ethnic 
minorities and perhaps four who represent Croatians abroad. 
The most complex part of forming the next government will be 
the process of bringing smaller parties into the coalition. 
Nevertheless, Tomcic is confident that there will be \"no 
great changes\" between the next coalition government and the 
current lineup of parties.  (Note: Uncertainty about which 
parties would form the next government has usually centered 
on the possibility that Tomcic\'s HSS would break with the 
current coalition and go with the HDZ -- a prospect which 
looks increasingly implausible with each passing week. End 
Note.) 
 
Next Government Must Have Stronger Coalition Agreement 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
10.  (C) Tomcic said he believes Croatia\'s democracy has 
developed far enough to \"allow the luxury\" of waiting to form 
coalitions until after elections.  The HSS will then advocate 
hammering out a strong national-level policy program in order 
to create conditions where disagreements over policy no 
longer disrupt the work of the government.  Such a program 
would mean that ICTY cooperation would not be an issue for 
debate, but an obligation of the government.  The same should 
hold true for issues relating to return of refugees and for 
working to improve relations with Serbia and Montenegro. 
 
11.  (C) The Ambassador praised Tomcic\'s leadership in the 
parliament and expressed his eagerness to continue a regular, 
private dialogue.  Tomcic readily accepted and proposed that 
the two meet again, more informally, toward the end of 
August, before the Sabor next convenes. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
12.  (C) Tomcic was on-message and worked hard to make a good 
impression; he clearly recognizes how important good 
relations with the U.S. are to achieving Croatia\'s goals.  A 
cagey, cautious politician, for Tomcic to predict a 
successful outcome of the next election with such confidence 
so far in advance is significant, even if his forecast 
largely represents the current conventional wisdom.

SUBJECT: PM RACAN TO AMBASSADOR: EAGER TO IMPROVE TIES WITH 
U.S. 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank, for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) During their first meeting, on July 23, Prime 
Minister Racan said he wanted good ties with the newly 
arrived U.S. Ambassador.  He alluded to sometimes rocky 
relations in the past, and stressed that it would be 
important to keep in regular contact, both formally and 
informally.  Racan was optimistic about upcoming elections in 
Croatia, indicating he expected more or less the same 
coalition to return to power -- although he suggested that he 
may be ready to step aside as Prime Minister.  Racan 
underscored Croatia\'s role in the region as a source of 
stability.  That included Croatia\'s role in the war on 
terrorism, which his government takes very seriously.  He 
said that Croatia remained committed to overcoming its 
wartime legacy, including by cooperating with ICTY.  End 
Summary. 
 
Racan Wants Strong U.S.-Croatia Relations 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) PM Racan opened his July 23 one-on-one meeting with 
Ambassador Frank by saying that the U.S. had special 
importance for him; while he usually lets the President and 
the Foreign Minister deal with foreign diplomats, he wanted 
to maintain regular contact, formally and informally, with 
the U.S. Ambassador.   It was a positive theme that dominated 
the one-and-half-hour introductory meeting.  Both the 
Ambassador and Prime Minister agreed to look to the future, 
to build on what the Ambassador described as a very good, 
solid bilateral relationship.  Racan wanted to ensure that 
the interests of the U.S. in Croatia were well taken care of, 
and he would view acts of anti-Americanism as acts against 
Croatia.  He said Croatia was with the U.S. in the fight 
against terrorism. 
Force of Stability 
------------------ 
 
3.  (C) Throughout the discussion, Racan stressed the 
importance of stability, both for Croatia and the region, 
both of which had only recently emerged from war.  He saw 
Croatia as a force of stability, and saw it as the country\'s 
\"duty\" to play that role effectively.  He contrasted 
Croatia\'s role with that of Bosnia next door, where the 
\"Islamic lobby\" figured more prominently.  To  illustrate 
this, Racan referred to his recent visit to Sarajevo and his 
initiative for Croatia to help build a highway in Bosnia 
along the European 5C route.  He said he made the proposal 
despite knowing he was touching a  \"hornet\'s nest.\"  He said 
BiH authorities had already secured capital for the project, 
and suggested the influence of \"Islamic capital\" could 
destabilize Bosnia and the region.  Racan referred to the 
fact that as many as 150 mosques had been built in recent 
years in Sarajevo, which he did not mind as a religious 
phenomenon, but he did mind if this upset the balance of all 
religious/ethnic groups in Bosnia. 
 
4.  (C) Racan cited a number of recent GOC initiatives as 
examples of Croatia\'s role in improving regional stability, 
including suspending visas requirements for SAM citizens, and 
its costly decision to compensate ethnic Serb returnee 
holders of tenancy rights.  The Prime Minister emphasized  -- 
sometimes implausibly -- that the GOC always had in mind the 
wider regional situation, even when making decisions that 
might result in differences with the U.S.  He argued that the 
GOC decision to sign the Vilnius Group declaration -- which 
was  generally supportive of the U.S. position on Iraq -- was 
made out of a desire to preserve regional stability.  When 
the GOC subsequently back-pedaled on the  declaration, and 
stated Croatia\'s opposition to the war in Iraq, Racan said he 
was upset to have his \"leadership\" questioned.  This was not 
about leadership,  Racan argued, but rather about preserving 
stability in the country.  Anti-war sentiment, about 80 
percent of the population, could not be ignored. 
 
U.S. and EU Share Views on Croatia 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The Ambassador noted that the U.S. and Croatia had 
sufficiently good relations that the two could disagree 
privately -- not in the press -- on some subjects while 
maintaining many common goals.  The Ambassador stressed the 
importance of regional stability, U.S. support for Croatia\'s 
accession to Euro-Atlantic institutions, and the importance 
for Croatia to press ahead on  economic reforms and job 
creation.  He added that both the U.S. and its EU  partners 
shared the same goals with regard to Croatia, including full 
cooperation with ICTY, the return of refugees, and the full 
normalization of relations with its neighbors.  The 
Ambassador stressed that these issues, which emerged from 
 
 
Croatia\'s wartime legacy, remained critical and could not be 
ignored. 
 
Elections 
--------- 
 
6.  (C) The Ambassador asked the Prime Minister to comment on 
the upcoming elections.  Racan replied that he did not expect 
great changes, unless the coalition made some big mistakes. 
Although Croatians are still dissatisfied with things this 
government has failed to do (i.e. prosecute corruption in 
privatization and reform the judiciary and state 
administration), they do recognize the government\'s 
achievements: general economic progress, including low 
inflation; stronger regional cooperation; substantial 
movement on NATO and EU accession; and road building and 
railroad modernization.  The positive trends will continue if 
the current coalition stays in power.  The return of  the HDZ 
would probably mean a return to the Tudjman era  -- which 
voters do not want.  As for possible changes in the make up 
of a new government, Racan somewhat unconvincingly suggested 
he may not want to be Prime Minister again.  He was 
exhausted, he said. 
 
HDZ: New and Improved? 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Speaking about the main opposition party, Racan said 
that, although the HDZ leadership might be \"new and 
improved,\" the party base remained more or less the same -- 
one reminiscent of Tudjman times.  The HDZ can complete its 
transformation only if it loses elections.  If it wins, the 
current opposition phase of transformation would merely be 
perceived as a temporary halt before the return to the same 
kind of rule under Tudjman.  Racan encouraged the Ambassador 
to maintain contact with the HDZ leadership, if only because 
such contact may encourage the reformers.  But reform of that 
party, he added, was a long way off.  Racan noted that the 
more reform-minded leaders of HDZ in Bosnia told him on his 
recent visit that they would like to see Racan\'s government 
-- rather than one led by HDZ -- win the next election. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (U) A pragmatic -- if sometimes phlegmatic -- politician, 
PM Racan came across as somebody who wants improved relations 
with the U.S.  He will be busy in coming weeks preparing for 
elections and cajoling his government to move forward on 
Croatia\'s EU requirements, but he told the Ambassador that he 
wanted to meet regularly.  Racan suggested getting together 
again at the end of August.  As for Racan\'s hint that he may 
be ready to step aside as Prime Minister, this was not 
conveyed with Shermanesque certitude; few other such rumors 
have circulated, and we suspect that, as of now, it should 
not be taken seriously.  Racan waited in the wings for years 
to get to power.  Assuming the ruling coalition wins, he will 
want to remain Prime Minister a good while longer.

COORDINATER FOR CYBERSECURITY ISSUES, AND DIJANA SIMIC, 
ASSISTANT MINISTER AT THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND 
TECHNOLOGY.  SIMIC SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
DEVELOPING A STRATEGY OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR THE 
21ST CENTURY, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF 
CROATIA\'S CYBERSECURITY NEEDS. 
 
3.  CROATIA IS A SIGNATORY TO THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE\'S 
CONVENTION ON CYBERSECURITY.  IT IS PASSING A SERIES OF

SUBJECT: REFUGEE RETURN ISSUES AND OPIC ROAD FINANCE; THE 
AMBASSADOR CALLS ON RECONSTRUCTION MINISTER CACIC 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR RALPH FRANK FOR REASONS 1.5 (B), AND (D). 
 
    SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ON JULY 21, THE AMBASSADOR PAID AN INTRODUCTORY CALL 
ON RADOMIR CACIC, CROATIA\'S MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS, 
RECONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD CACIC HE 
WAS PLEASED WITH RECENT GOC INITIATIVES AIMED AT SPEEDING UP 
THE PACE OF REFUGEE RETURNS.  HE ENCOURAGED CACIC AND HIS 
MINISTRY TO MOVE FORWARD ON OTHER KEY ELEMENTS INCLUDING 
REPOSSESSION AND RECONSTRUCTION.  REGARDING THE STATUS OF AN 
OPIC GUARANTEE FOR FINANCING OF A HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION 
PROJECT, THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THE GUARANTEE WAS 
STILL UNDER REVIEW IN WASHINGTON.  CACIC REACTED STRONGLY TO 
THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE GUARANTEE MIGHT NOT BE APPROVED. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
PROGRESS ON RETURNS 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) IN HIS INTRODUCTORY CALL ON JULY 21, THE AMBASSADOR, 
ACCOMPANIED BY USAID DIRECTOR, TOLD MINISTER CACIC THAT 
REFUGEE RETURNS REMAIN AN IMPORTANT CONCERN IN THE REGION FOR 
THE USG.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED SATISFACTION THAT THE GOC 
HAD MADE GREAT STRIDES IN RECENT MONTHS IN APPROVING POLICIES 
RELATED TO REFUGEE RETURNS.  THE GOC\'S MOST RECENT 
INITIATIVE, ANNOUNCED ON JUNE 12, AIMED AT PROVIDING A 
HOUSING SOLUTION TO THOSE WHO LOST TENANCY RIGHTS DURING THE 
WAR WAS ALSO WELCOME.  THE AMBASSADOR URGED THE GOC TO FOCUS 
ITS ATTENTION NOW ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW POLICY IN 
ORDER TO PRODUCE QUICK RESULTS.  AS THE EU AND NATO GAUGE 
CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARD MEMBERSHIP, THEY WILL BASE THEIR 
    JUDGMENTS ONLY ON RESULTS ON THE GROUND, NOT GOVERNMENT 
ANNOUNCEMENTS.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO URGED THE GOC TO EXPEDITE 
THE PACE OF OTHER KEY MEASURES ALREADY UNDERWAY, ESPECIALLY 
THE REPOSSESSION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF PROPERTY. 
 
3. (C) CACIC THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS ASSESSMENT, 
SAYING IT WAS \"RIGHT ON THE MARK.\"  HE SAID THAT HIS MINISTRY 
IS FOCUSING ITS ATTENTION ON IMPLEMENTATION, WHICH HAS BEEN 
SLOWED SOMEWHAT BY THE LACK OF PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES. 
 FINANCES WERE NOT A PROBLEM.  CACIC TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT 
5,000 TO 7,000 HOUSES WILL BE BUILT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. 
HE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT ONLY A SMALL PORTION (ABOUT 
5,000) OF THE ALMOST 20,000 APPLICANTS WILL QUALIFY FOR 
HOUSING ASSISTANCE.  MANY OF THE APPLICANTS DO NOT MEET THE 
CRITERIA AND WILL NOT RECEIVE A POSITIVE DECISION. 
REPOSSESSION OF PROPERTY IS PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY.  HE 
PREDICTED THAT ONLY ABOUT 1,500 CASES, OUT OF A TOTAL OF 
20,000, WILL NOT BE RESOLVED BY THE END OF THE YEAR.  THE 
OWNERS OF THOSE PROPERTIES WILL BE PAID RENT UNTIL THEY 
ASSUME CONTROL OF THEIR PROPERTY.  THE HOME IMPROVEMENT LOAN 
PROGRAM BACKED BY USAID CREDIT GUARANTEE WILL HAVE A BIG 
IMPACT ON HELPING RESOLVE THE HOUSING ISSUE, SAID CACIC. 
 
NO DECISION ON OPIC FINANCING 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) RESPONDING TO A JULY 17 QUERY TO THE EMBASSY ABOUT THE 
ISSUE OF AN OPIC GUARANTEE OF CROATIAN SOVEREIGN DEBT FOR A 
HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, THE AMBASSADOR TOLD CACIC SAID 
THAT THE GUARANTEE PROPOSAL WAS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION IN 
WASHINGTON.  THIS WAS PART OF THE INTERAGENCY PROCESS, AND A 
    FINAL DECISION WAS AT LEAST SEVERAL WEEKS AWAY.  THE DELAY 
WAS NOT CROATIA-SPECIFIC.  SINCE APPROVAL WAS NOT GUARANTEED, 
ALL OPTIONS SHOULD STILL BE LEFT OPEN.  THE AMBASSADOR 
REITERATED THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS HIGHWAY 
PROJECT IN OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. 
 
5. (C) CACIC REACTED STRONGLY TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S SUGGESTION. 
 HE SAID THAT BECHTEL HAD PLEDGED TO HELP RAISE FUNDING IN 
THE AMOUNT OF 250 MILLION USD FOR A PORTION OF THE PROJECT. 
THE GOC HAD ALREADY ASSUMED SIGNIFICANT COST OVERRUNS FOR THE 
PROJECT.  HE LATER WENT ON TO EXPLAIN HOW HE HAD TURNED DOWN 
FINANCING FROM THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, WHICH WANTED TO 
INVEST IN CROATIA.  A NEGATIVE DECISION ON THE OPIC GUARANTEE 
WOULD NOT GO OVER WELL WITH THE GOC AND COULD BE A \"PUBLIC 
DISASTER\" FOR THE U.S. IF SUCH A DECISION WERE TO REACH THE 
CROATIAN PRESS.  THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE FOR THE GOC ON THIS 
ISSUE, PARTICULARLY SINCE ELECTIONS ARE A FEW MONTHS AWAY. 
CACIC SAID HE WOULD TRY TO WORK WITH OTHER KEY MINISTRIES IN 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROBLEMS ARISE.  (COMMENT:  WE DO NOT 
SHARE CACIC\'S VIEW.  WHILE THE GOC MAY BE UPSET IF IT HAS TO 
SETTLE FOR MORE EXPENSIVE FINANCING, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT 
ANY CRITICISM OF A POSSIBLE NEGATIVE DECISION ON AN OPIC 
GUARANTEE WOULD GAIN MUCH TRACTION IN THE PRESS.  END COMMENT.

MFA\'S UN DEPARTMENT.  SKRACIC PRESENTED THE GOC\'S FORMAL 
REQUEST FOR A BILATERAL MEETING WITH SECRETARY POWELL FOR

SECRETARY WILL BE AND THAT IF A MEETING ON THE MARGINS OF 
 
SIPDIS 
    UNGA IS NOT POSSIBLE, PICULA IS READY TO TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON 
EITHER IMMEDIATELY BEFORE OR AFTER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. 
PICULA NOW PLANS TO BE IN NEW YORK FROM SEPTEMBER 22 - 26,

WOULD BE CROATIA\'S CONTRIBUTION OF TROOPS TO IRAQ, A POSSIBLE 
COMPROMISE FORMULA ON ARTICLE 98/ICC AND COUNTERTERRORISM. 
THE DCM TOLD SKRACIC THAT WE WOULD FORWARD THE GOC REQUEST.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR RALPH FRANK FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) DURING A JULY 30 VISIT TO ZAGREB, HIGH REPRESENTATIVE 
ASHDOWN PRAISED THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S PRODUCTIVE POLICY 
TOWARD BOSNIA OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AND EXPRESSED HOPE 
    THAT THE POLICY WOULD CONTINUE AFTER UPCOMING ELECTIONS IN 
CROATIA.  HE REFUSED TO BE ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATIONS ON THE 
STATUS OF THE PORT OF PLOCE AND ON A ROAD CONSTRUCTION 
PROJECT IN THE REGION OF NEUM, BIH, AND ENCOURAGED THE SIDES 
TO WORK THROUGH THESE BILATERAL ISSUES THEMSELVES.  IN A 
PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, ASHDOWN DESCRIBED OHR\'S 
AMBITIOUS WORK PLAN FOR THIS AUTUMN AND ASKED THAT WE URGE 
CROATIAN POLITICIANS TO ABSTAIN FROM CAMPAIGN RHETORIC WHICH 
COULD AFFECT PROGRESS IN BIH.  HE AGREED TO CONTINUE TO PRESS 
OTHER INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ACTORS TO ENSURE THE GOC MEETS 
REFUGEE RETURN IMPLEMENTATION BENCHMARKS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) HIGH REPRESENTATIVE PADDY ASHDOWN VISITED ZAGREB ON 
JULY 30 AT THE INVITATION OF THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT.  IN 
MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT MESIC, PM RACAN, WITH 
PARLIAMENTARIANS AND WITH THE PRESS, ASHDOWN PRAISED THE 
RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S \"PRODUCTIVE\" POLICY TOWARD BIH AND 
PRESIDENT MESIC\'S MORAL LEADERSHIP IN THE REGION.  IN HIS 
MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, ASHDOWN THANKED THE USG FOR ITS 
STEADFAST SUPPORT OF OHR\'S MISSION. 
 
3.  (C) ASHDOWN SAID THAT HE REJECTED EFFORTS BY BOTH RACAN 
AND MESIC TO GET OHR TO ENGAGE ON THE CORRIDOR 5C ROAD 
PROJECT AND ON THE STATUS OF THE PORT OF PLOCE, BOTH ISSUES 
ASHDOWN BELIEVES SHOULD REMAIN BILATERAL ISSUES.  AS HE DID 
DURING HIS MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR (REF), RACAN TOLD 
ASHDOWN THAT HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SPECTER OF \"ISLAMIC 
FUNDING\" FOR THE IMPORTANT ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AND 
THOUGHT THAT THE TENDERING PROCESS WOULD BE BIASED TOWARD A 
MAYLAYSIAN FIRM.  ASHDOWN SAID HE ASSURED RACAN THAT THE 
BIDDING FOR THE PROJECT WOULD BE TO EUROPEAN STANDARDS AND 
    THAT CONCERNS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE GOBIH, NOT TO OHR. 
ASHDOWN SAID HE WAS PLEASED THAT IT APPEARED THE TWO SIDES 
WERE COMING TO CLOSURE ON THE ISSUE OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT 
ON THE STATUS OF THE PORT OF PLOCE. 
 
4.  (C) ASHDOWN SAID HE WAS VERY RELIEVED TO HEAR CONFIDENT 
PREDICTIONS FROM THE CURRENT COALITION ABOUT THE LIKELY 
OUTCOME OF CROATIA\'S NEXT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE SAID 
THAT FOR ALL ITS FAULTS, THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY TOWARD 
BIH HAS BEEN A \"RAY OF LIGHT\" IN THE REGION.  ASHDOWN 
DESCRIBED A SERIES OF PROJECTS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING 
NATIONAL-LEVEL BIH INSTITUTIONS WHICH OHR HOPES TO PRESS 
FORWARD IN THE COMING MONTHS.  HE ALERTED THE AMBASSADOR THAT 
NATIONALIST-LEANING POLITICIANS IN CROATIA MAY OBJECT TO SOME 
OF THESE REFORMS; HE ASKED THAT THE USG URGE POLITICAL 
LEADERS TO ABSTAIN FROM MAKING THEM ISSUES IN THE UPCOMING 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN. 
 
5.  (C) ASHDOWN SAID THAT HE PLANNED A NEW REGIONAL 
INITIATIVE TO RE-OPEN TRADE CORRIDORS FROM THE BIH REGION IN 
TREBINJE TO THE CROATIAN CITY OF DUBROVNIK.  TREBINJE\'S 
PROXIMITY TO DUBROVNIK AND THE \"DE FACTO ECONOMIC BLOCKADE\" 
OF TRADE INTO CROATIA HAS TURNED THE TREBINJE REGION OF BIH 
INTO A \"NEST OF THIEVES.\"  HE HOPES TO ENGAGE WITH 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO URGE THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT 
TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES -- 
ESPECIALLY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS -- TO DUBROVNIK.  ASHDOWN 
SAID HE EXPECTED A FAIR HEARING IN ZAGREB, BUT HAD FEW HOPES 
THAT DUBROVNIK MAYOR SUICA (HDZ) WOULD BE RECEPTIVE TO THE 
INITIATIVE. 
 
    6.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD ASHDOWN THAT REFUGEE RETURN AND 
REINTEGRATION ISSUES REMAIN A TOP USG CONCERN FOR THE REGION. 
 DESPITE POSITIVE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW PROJECTS AND 
CROSS-BORDER MEETINGS, THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS THE 
GOC FOR PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION BEFORE GIVING CROATIA 
CREDIT FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED 
ASHDOWN TO ENSURE THAT IN MEETINGS WITH EU COLLEAGUES, HE 
PRESS THEM TO INSIST ON RESULTS ON THE GROUND, NOT 
ANNOUNCEMENTS IN ZAGREB.  ASHDOWN READILY AGREED THAT THE 
TIME TO APPLY LEVERAGE IS NOW, AND SAID HE WOULD RAISE THE 
ISSUE, ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE EU COUNTRIES LESS LIKELY TO HOLD 
CROATIA ACCOUNTABLE.

REF: LJUBLJANA 0749 
 
Classified By: PolOff Darren Taylor for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Government of Croatia is frustrated with the 
leadership of the International Trust Fund and will block 
extension ITF director Jernej Cimpersek\'s mandate.  GoC 
officials expressed their frustration with Cimpersek\'s lack 
of professionalism and his unwillingness to focus on all 
donor priorities which, they claim, has led to a 
\"polarization\" of the demining community in the Balkans. 
They acknowledged that Cimpersek has been difficult to work 
with, but rejected the allegation that their decision was 
based on personality conflict.  The GoC asserted that their 
decision is firm; as an extension can be passed only by 
consensus of the managing board, it appears Cimpersek\'s days 
as Director are numbered.  GoC officials said they would 
prepare a position paper for the ITF managing board and key 
donors outlining reasons for their position.  End Summary.

frustration with ITF Director Cimpersek.  She said the ITF 
managing board reacted strongly to Croatia\'s announcement at 
the July 22 board meeting at which it blocked extension of 
Cimpersek\'s mandate, but insisted that Croatia\'s decision is 
firm.  Labor Minister Vidovic said that the position Plestina 
presented was the view of the GoC, and that the decision to 
block Cimpersek\'s extension had been taken in advance of the 
July 22 meeting.  The decision was final and would not be 
reversed under any circumstances, asserted Minister Vidovic. 
 
3.  (C) Vidovic said that there have been a series of 
incidents over the past year in which Cimpersek and his 
deputy Goran Gacnik had acted inappropriately, both in public 
and at regional fora on humanitarian demining.  It seemed at 
times that their goal was to embarrass GOC officials present 
at the meetings or Croatia in general.  He stated that while 
the GOC was not completely innocent of responsibility for the 
strained relationship, GOC officials were always willing to 
sit at the table to discuss ways to find solutions. 
 
4.  (C) Vidovic explained that as the third largest donor to 
the ITF behind the US and EU, the GoC recognizes its 
responsibility to support the ITF\'s role in the region.  The 
ITF has contributed to important positive developments in 
demining in the region, but the current leadership of the ITF 
seems to have lost sight of the fact that it is the donors, 
not the ITF staff, which are most responsible for these 
successes.  Vidovic said he had instructed key personnel to 
draft a position paper outlining the GOC\'s position 
concerning the ITF leadership, a copy of which will be 
provided to ITF managing board members and key donors.  He 
had also alerted FM Picula about this issue to prepare him 
for possible engagement. 
5. (C) Plestina and Jungwirth stated that most of their 
concerns centered on issues of professionalism, regional 
ethnic biases, and the polarization of the demining community 
in the region.  They claimed they made repeated efforts to 
improve their working relationship with the ITF, but 
Cimpersek seemed to prefer to distance himself from Croatia 
and engage as little as possible on Croatian matters.  When 
he did engage, it was often in a rude, uncooperative, or 
unprofessional manner.  During bilateral meetings, the ITF 
director would launch into tirades about what the ITF was or 
was not willing do in Croatia, and how Croats are his biggest 
problem in the region.  Plestina claimed other 
representatives from regional mine action centers had lodged 
similar complaints. 
 
USG Intervention Appreciated, But Unsuccessful 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6. (C) Vidovic and Plestina expressed appreciation for USG 
efforts to improve the relationship with Cimpersek, 
especially PM Assistant Secretary Bloomfield\'s personal 
involvement during a GOC-sponsored conference on demining in 
Dubrovnik in October 2002.  They noted that even in the 
presence of senior USG officials, the ITF director displayed 
unprofessional behavior and used unacceptable language at 
 
times when contentious issues were discussed. 
 
7. (C) Plestina claimed that although they had low 
expectations, the GoC had made efforts to improve the working 
relationship after the meeting in Dubrovnik, if for no other 
reason than they had been asked to do so by the USG.  But 
Cimpersek showed signs that he was unwilling to take steps to 
improve the relationship.  He did not attend meetings that 
were held in Croatia and refused to travel to Croatia for 
some time.  He has been unwilling to meet with GOC leaders to 
discuss ways of improving cooperation or to solicit GOC views 
about developments at the ITF. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The GoC decision to block Cimpersek\'s extension does 
not come as a surprise; Plestina and CROMAC have complained 
to us many times in the past, and we have been present at 
meetings when Cimpersek has acted inappropriately.  The 
presence of Labor Minister Vidovic at the July 28 meeting was 
clearly intended to ensure that we understood that the GoC 
decision is a formal cabinet position and not just a 
reflection of a personality conflict between the ITF director 
and the PM\'s wife.  Vidovic has in the past told us that he 
does not want the disagreement over the leadership of the ITF 
to become an irritant, but wants to make sure we understand 
that the GoC position is final. 
 
9. (C) We concur with the GoC that it is time for Cimpersek 
to go and suggest that the managing board should seek a new, 
more professional director who is committed to working 
closely with governments in the region and with the main 
donors, both in the field and in donor capitals.

SUBJECT: CROATIA USING \"UNCOMFORTABLE\" BACK-CHANNEL TO 
CONVINCE GOTOVINA TO SURRENDER 
 
REF: ZAGREB 1579 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: DCM Patrick S. Moon for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The Croatian government is using an unusual 
back-channel in an attempt to create conditions in which 
PIFWC Ante Gotovina would surrender for transfer to ICTY. 
The GoC\'s urgency and unorthodox approach is derived from the 
UK\'s refusal to ratify Croatia\'s Stabilization and 
Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU unless Croatia 
demonstrates its commitment to cooperate with ICTY.  Unless 
the SAA is ratified soon, Croatia will miss a key deadline in 
its application for EU membership.  ICTY is showing some 
flexibility in its approach to the Gotovina case, but the 
likelihood that this particular effort will bring about 
Gotovina\'s surrender is uncertain.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) UK Ambassador in Croatia Nicholas Jarrold has kept us 
closely informed of an unusual GoC back-channel effort to 
broker the surrender of ICTY PIFWC Ante Gotovina.  The key 
players in the effort are: 
 
- Zeljko Bagic, one of President Mesic\'s top National 
Security Advisors (Mesic has been seeking a way for Gotovina 
to \"tell his side of the story\" before giving himself up - 
ref); 
 
- Ivo Pukanic, editor of the sensationalist newsweekly 
\"Nacional,\" which on June 10 ran Gotovina\'s first interview 
after two years in hiding (in the interview, Gotovina said he 
recognized the authority of the ICTY, widely interpreted as a 
signal he was ready to talk about surrendering); 
 
- Thomas Osorio, ICTY representative in Zagreb; and 
 
- UK Ambassador Nicholas Jarrold, a hesitant participant, but 
evidently selected by the GoC because the UK is the EU 
country Croatia needs most to convince that they are serious 
about transferring Gotovina to the Hague. 
 
3.  (C) On July 30, Pukanic approached Amb. Jarrold (at the 
urging of Bagic) and said that Gotovina offered to make 
himself available in Zagreb for an interview with ICTY 
representatives.  Gotovina was prepared to agree to fly to 
The Hague and surrender five days later.  Pukanic said that 
Gotovina is seeking a scenario which would retain his \"honor 
as a Croatian general.\"  Amb. Jarrold rejected this scheme 
and held firm: Gotovina must go to The Hague -- no detours. 
Nonetheless, Jarrold said that he saw no problem with 
Gotovina making himself \"available\" to the ICTY. 
 
4.  (C) Amb. Jarrold instructed his DCM to brief local ICTY 
representative Osorio, who apparently consulted with The 
Hague and came back with a proposal for Gotovina: Osorio and 
several of his investigators would meet Gotovina in Bosnia 
for a period of hours for an interview, giving Gotovina the 
opportunity to make the statement to investigators that he 
seeks.  SFOR would provide \"security\" for the meeting, and 
Gotovina would surrender to SFOR afterwards.  Having Gotovina 
surrender in Bosnia would also spare GOC officials all the 
angst related to having to send their \"war hero\" off to The 
Hague. 
 
5.  (C) Amb. Jarrold told us that he delivered this offer to 
Nacional editor Pukanic on July 31.  Pukanic responded that 
such a meeting was not possible since Gotovina was \"5,000 to 
10,000\" kilometers away.  Pukanic suggested a meeting in 
Mexico City.  Amb. Jarrold immediately rejected such an 
arrangement pointing out the obvious complications of 
involving Mexican and possibly American authorities. 
Jarrold also reported that UK contacts with del Ponte\'s staff 
in The Hague suggested that she might be backtracking from 
the offer Osorio made here.  He pointed to the difficulties 
in dealing with individuals on her staff and del Ponte\'s poor 
relations with other parts of the Tribunal. 
 
6.  (C) Amb. Jarrold said that his involvement has run its 
course, and he is ending his role, with which he was clearly 
uncomfortable.  Jarrold said EC officials told him that for 
Croatia to stay on their desired timeline in the EU 
application process, they need all the ratifications of 
Croatia\'s SAA by late December or early January.  The UK 
would require three months for the Parliament, government and 
Queen to act.  The Dutch are the other holdout, but The Hague 
needs only a week or so to act since the Dutch parliament has 
already approved the SAA; the government is holding the 
ratification pending sufficient GOC action on ICTY issues. 
 
 
7.  (C) Unlike the previous interactions with Gotovina, these 
talks have not yet surfaced in the press.  We will have to 
wait until early next week when the next issue of Nacional 
appears to see whether Pukanic will make public his latest 
intermediary services. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The ball is again in Gotovina\'s court with the GOC 
watching anxiously and no doubt praying that Gotovina will 
take up the ICTY\'s offer.  While Gotovina\'s surrender is a 
necessary step for British ratification of the SAA, it will 
not likely be sufficient.  London will probably also want to 
see that the GOC acts appropriately when it receives new 
indictments, rumored for September.  The GOC has said it will 
be responsive and act quickly, but we -- like the British -- 
will want to see that they do so and not merely accept their 
word.

POSITIVE RESULTS 
 
REF: ZAGREB 913 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  Croatia has made important progress on reforms since the 
elections in January 2000 brought an end to the nationalist 
regime of former President Tudjman\'s HDZ party.  But this 
progress is fragile, and if the next parliamentary elections 
result in a government that is not committed to continuing 
these reforms, it could stall Croatia\'s movement toward 
accession into Euro-Atlantic institutions, a key USG goal for 
regional stability in Southeast Europe. 
 
2.  One of the challenges to the USG\'s SEED-funded democratic 
governance assistance programs is to ensure the reform 
process in Croatia continues by helping reform-oriented 
political parties succeed.  To do this, USAID implementers 
are directed to assist parties in crafting messages that 
explain to voters how continued progress on reform is in 
their interest and also to appeal directly to citizens to 
participate in the electoral process.  This strategy is 
working.  Recent USAID-sponsored polls show that, with 
elections expected in late November 2003, it is likely that a 
coalition of reform-oriented political parties will be able 
to form a government committed to a progressive agenda.  End 
Summary. 
 
Political Environment for Assistance 
------------------------------------ 
 
3.  Expectations of voters following the elections that 
brought Croatia\'s first coalition government to power in 
January 2000 were unrealistically high.  Popular support for 
coalition parties began to slip when voters realized that it 
would take time for some reforms to show results.  The 
results of local-level elections held in May 2001 confirmed 
this, and coalition party leaders were stunned by the strong 
showing of the nationalist, right-wing HDZ.  USAID assistance 
programs implemented mainly by grantees National Democratic 
Institute and International Republic Institute are intended 
to help reform-oriented parties explain their successes and 
the benefits of remaining on the reform path. 
 
NDI Assistance 
-------------- 
 
4.  NDI\'s program works on political party training, both at 
the central and local level.  Croatia\'s current leadership 
has been frustrated by the public\'s persistent belief that 
there has been no progress toward making good on campaign 
promises.  NDI is working with the leading coalition party to 
develop a communications strategy which explains the 
government\'s achievements over the past three years.  In 
addition to its training program for members of Parliament, 
NDI is also helping parties develop better strategies to 
reach out directly to constituents. 
 
5.  During the campaign which brought the current coalition 
to government, NDI encouraged the development of a citizen 
action NGO, GONG.  This NGO now serves as a sub-grantee 
supported by NDI to carry out a range of pre-election 
activities to get out the vote, especially important for 
strengthening the momentum for reform.  GONG also holds 
\"citizen hours\" in communities around Croatia to bring 
citizens into direct contact with their elected officials at 
all levels.  Response to this program has been excellent, and 
has enjoyed participation from all political levels, 
including President Mesic. 
 
IRI Assistance 
-------------- 
 
6.  IRI assistance has had the highest public profile since 
it works not only with political party spokespeople but with 
journalists as well.  IRI\'s in-depth political polling has 
become invaluable to reform-oriented political parties as 
they make their appeals to voters.  Top U.S. political 
analysts help parties decide -- using extensive polls -- 
which campaign issues will be most resonant with voters and 
then help parties develop messages which will encourage 
voters to continue to support reform-oriented parties. 
 
7.  IRI completed its second in a series of three polls in 
late June 2003.  The first poll served as a \"wake-up call\" to 
 
 
coalition parties who began -- finally -- to heed advice of 
U.S. consultants.  They took responsibility for not 
fulfilling voter expectations, and then began to 
systematically explain their government\'s achievements of the 
past three years.  Coalition political leaders have focused 
on issues they knew (based on poll results) resonated with 
voters, like improving the tourism industry, transportation 
infrastructure and making progress toward membership in the 
EU.  The second IRI poll shows that this message is getting 
through and that support for coalition parties is increasing. 
 
8.  U.S. analysts presented the data to the senior levels of 
Croatia\'s leading political parties.  They explained the 
poll\'s most significant results: the coalition-leading SDP 
has begun to gain ground on the opposition HDZ, which has 
become stagnant.  Undecided voters have begun to lean toward 
coalition parties, and the key indicator, the number of 
respondents who think the Government is leading Croatia in 
the \"right direction,\" is on the rise. 
 
9.  The poll showed that the majority of undecided voters -- 
still over twenty percent -- are women or younger voters, the 
natural constituency of reform-oriented parties.  The 
opposition-leading HDZ has not branched out from its core 
constituents of older, less-educated, rural voters and the 
percentage of undecided voters who declared that they would 
never vote for the HDZ is high.  The bottom line, according 
to IRI analysts, is that a return of a coalition similar to 
the current lineup of political parties and excluding the HDZ 
is very likely. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  We are pleased that coalition parties took the advice of 
our USAID-funded experts and also that the advice had such 
immediate and positive results.  Coalition party leaders have 
become confident that they will return to government after 
elections in November, but we continue to warn against 
complacency.  We will continue to urge reform-minded parties 
to focus their message on how continued progress on reforms 
will help them achieve their long-term goals.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ELAB, ETRD, PHUM, HR, HR 
SUBJECT: CROATIA: INPUT FOR CHILD LABOR REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 193266 
 
1.  Croatia has a good record on preventing the worst forms 
of child labor.  The Government has strengthened its 
legislative base and has made progress on implementation and 
enforcement.  In preparing our response to reftel, post met 
with officials at the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare 
and also sought input from representatives of human rights 
NGOs and labor organizations.  We advised our interlocutors 
that they may submit their views to the USDOL directly (per 
reftel). 
 
2.  Below follows post\'s response to questions posed in 
reftel about Croatia\'s efforts to prevent the worst forms of 
child labor.  Responses are keyed to questions and indicators 
posed in reftel instructions. 
 
A - Does Croatia has adequate laws and regulations 
proscribing the worst forms of child labor? 
 
Indicators: 
 
-Has Croatia ratified ILO Convention 182 or taken concrete 
steps toward ratification? 
 
Yes.  The Croatian parliament adopted ILO Convention 182 on 
the worst forms of child labor on July 17, 2001; the 
convention went into force in Croatia on July 17, 2002. 
 
-What laws and regulations have been promulgated on child 
labor, such as minimum age(s) for employment or hazardous 
forms of work? If there is a minimum age for employment, is 
that age consistent with the age for completing educational 
requirements? 
 
Several laws and regulations have been promulgated on child 
labor, including the labor law, government regulations on 
minor employment (2002), Croatia\'s occupational safety act, 
the revised criminal code, family act, law on ombudsman for 
children (2003), defense act (2003), elementary education 
act, law on juvenile courts, Croatia\'s constitution and the 
national action plan for children.  The minimum age for 
employment is 15.  Children between the ages 15 and 18 may 
only work with written permission from a legal guardian. 
Education is free and compulsory through grade eight and 
generally completed by the age 14.  According to the 
occupational safety and health act, children under age 18 are 
prohibited from working overtime, at night or under dangerous 
labor conditions. 
 
-Do Croatia\'s laws and regulations define the worst forms of 
child labor or hazardous work as the ILO defines those terms? 
 If Croatia has ratified Convention 182, has it developed a 
list of occupations considered to be worst forms of child 
labor, as called for in article 4 of the convention? 
 
There are no regulations in Croatia\'s legislation that 
expressly define what is considered \"a worst form of child 
labor\" but a series of laws and sub-acts regulate this issue. 
 Pursuant to Croatia\'s labor law, the ministry of labor and 
social welfare passed regulations in 2002 restricting types 
of employment that cannot be performed by a minor, stipulates 
types of employment which can be performed by a minor only if 
his/her health condition meets specific requirements. 
 
-Have there been any recent governmental or judicial 
initiatives to strengthen or enforce child labor legislation 
and regulations? 
 
The government strengthened child labor legislation and 
regulations by adopting the following new regulations 
government the employment of minors and by passing a new law 
creating a national ombudsman for children (in effect since 
June 18, 2003).  In order to ensure better implementation of 
the goals set under the national action program on children 
the cabinet has founded the national council for children -- 
a group of state and local institutions that promote general 
children\'s rights issues. 
 
B) Does Croatia has adequate laws and regulations for the 
implementation and enforcement of proscriptions against the 
worst forms of child labor? 
 
Indicators: 
 
-What legal remedies are available to government agencies 
that enforce child labor laws and regulations (criminal 
penalties, civil fines, court orders)? -are these enforcement 
remedies adequate to punish and deter violations? 
 
Article 228 of the labor law stipulates penalties and fines 
 
against companies and individuals found in violation of the 
laws regulating the employment of minors under the age 15 
that range from HRK 10,000 to 30,000 for companies, and from 
HRK 3,000 to 10,000 for individuals.  Croatia\'s criminal code 
stipulates sanctions for a range of crimes violating human 
freedom, such as slavery, international prostitution, a 
procurement of minors for sexual purposes and so on with 
penalties ranging from three months to 10 years in prison. 
The occupational safety act stipulates that firms employing 
minors against the provisions of this law shall be fined HRK 
10,000 to 40,000. 
 
-Have these enforcement provisions been applied? 
 
Yes.  According to the ministry of interior, during the 
period January 1, 2000 - December 31, 2002, 76 cases of 
criminal acts against children that relate to the worst forms 
of child labor pursuant to the convention were detected and 
reported.  70 criminal acts had to do with child and minor 
abuse in pornography, four criminal acts related to slavery 
and the transport of slaves, two criminal acts of 
international prostitution. 
 
From January 2002 - April 2003, labor inspectors found that 
five minors (all male), ages 16-17, illegally performing work 
under special circumstances.  There were four persons in 
bakeries and one transporting timber from the forest.  Labor 
inspectors ordered the employer to dismiss the minors and 
filed a complaint against the employer in misdemeanor court. 
Misdemeanor courts fined the employers HRK 10,000 (about USD 
1600) in one and HRK 1,000 in the other case. 
 
From January 2002 until April 2003, labor inspectors found 
117 violations of the legal provisions (99 minors) in 
businesses of hospitality (catering), trade, industry and 
construction and the minors worked as waiters, salesmen, 
bakers and helper construction laborers.  Out of 99 persons, 
65 were female and 34 male.  Employers were issued orders to 
refrain from employing minors for night work and inspectors 
filed requests for initiation of the legal proceedings 
against all employers that acted against the provisions of 
the law. 
 
C) Has Croatia established formal institutional mechanisms to 
investigate and address complaints relating to the worst 
forms of child labor? 
 
Indicators: 
 
-Has the government designated an authority to implement and 
enforce child labor laws and regulations? 
 
Yes.  The State Inspectorate is the government agency 
empowered to conduct on site investigations and ensure 
implementation of employment regulations.  Labor inspectors 
have the authority to issue orders to employers to either 
assign minors to different, appropriate jobs or dismiss them 
from work according to the labor law.  Labor inspectors can 
file request with courts to initiate legal proceedings 
against employers they find to be in violation of law.  The 
Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare has been designated as 
the national focal point for prevention of child abuse. 
 
-What are the mechanisms for receiving, investigating and 
addressing child labor complaints? To what extent are 
complaints investigated and violations addressed? 
 
The Ombudsman for children is responsible for coordinating, 
promoting and protecting rights of children.  The Ombudsman 
monitors the implementation of all regulations related to 
children rights pursuant to the constitution, convention on 
children rights and other international documents related to 
rights of children.  The office has the authority to propose 
measures to bodies of state government, local and regional 
self-government, legal and physical persons how to undertake 
measures to prevent violations.  The Ombudsman can initiate 
regulatory changes to ensure protection of rights. 
 
-What level of resources does the government devote to 
investigating exploitative child labor cases throughout 
Croatia? 
 
According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, the 
GOC allocates funding from the state budget for projects 
aimed at protection of children from abuse and neglect, 
including projects which are carried out by NGOs and 
individuals (hot line, shelters, advisories) 
 
-How many child labor inspections and investigations have 
been conducted over the past year?  How many have resulted in 
fines, penalties or convictions? 
 
(see above) 
 
-Has the government provided awareness raising and/or 
training activities for government officials charged with 
enforcing child labor laws? 
 
The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare conducts seminars 
and workshops to update employees and other inspectors on 
changes in legislation. 
 
D) Have social programs been implemented to prevent the 
engagement of children in the worst forms of child labor, and 
to assist in removing children engaged in the worst forms of 
child labor? 
 
Indicators: 
 
-What initiatives has the government supported to prevent 
children from entering exploitative work situations, to 
withdraw children engaged in such labor, and to advocate on 
behalf of children involved in such employment and their 
families? 
 
The national program for demographic development and the 
national employment policy deal both directly or indirectly 
with issues of child protection. 
 
-Does the government support programs to promote children\'s 
access to primary schooling and to enhance the quality and 
relevance of schooling? 
 
 
-Do Croatia\'s laws/regulations call for universal or 
compulsory education?  Are these requirements enforced? 
 
Primary education is mandatory.  Parents must enroll their 
children to a primary school otherwise the law on elementary 
school education stipulates fines from HRK 60-300. 
 
According to Croatia\'s center for research and development of 
education, the primary enrollment rate in 1998 was 95%. (up 
from 87.1% in 1996 and 82.3% in 1994, as reported by the 
USDOL). 
 
E) Does Croatia have a comprehensive policy aimed at the 
elimination of the worst forms of child labor? 
 
Indicators: 
 
-Does Croatia have a comprehensive policy or national program 
of action on child labor? 
 
Croatia has a national program of action for children, which 
also covers the issue of child labor.  This program is 
currently being audited with the objective of ensuring 
operational implementation of the envisaged goals.  In order 
to ensure better implementation of the goals set under the 
national action program on children, the Croatian government 
created the National Council for Children -- a group of state 
and local institutions that promote general children\'s rights 
issues. 
 
-Has the government made a public statement/commitment to 
eradicate the worst forms of child labor? 
 
No.

DIRECT SUPPORT IF OUR INTENTION IS TO ENCOURAGE JOINT OR 
BILATERAL EXERCISES UNDER THE CHARTER. END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL, POLOFF AND NAVY ATTACHE MET 
SEPARATELY WITH MFA ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE NORTH AMERICA DESK 
ANDREA BEKIC AND ASSISTANT MINISTER OF DEFENSE JELENA 
GRCIC-POLIC ON AUGUST 12.  BOTH INTERLOCUTORS ASKED FOR THE 
U.S. POSITION BEFORE RESPONDING FORMALLY TO THE ALBANIAN 
PROPOSAL.  WE STATED THAT WHILE WE ENCOURAGED REGIONAL 
    COOPERATION, WE WANTED TO HEAR CROATIA,S VIEWS ON THE MOU 
BEFORE COMING TO A POSITION OURSELVES. 
 
4. (C) ASSISTANT MINISTER GRCIC-POLIC TOLD US THAT CROATIA 
VIEWS THE CHARTER PRIMARILY AS A POLITICAL DOCUMENT, AND NOT 
A MILITARY INSTRUMENT.  IN A FOLLOW UP CONVERSATION WITH NAVY 
ATTACHE AUGUST 13, GRCIC-POLIC SHARPENED HER POINTS, 
EMPHASIZING THAT WHILE SHE WAS STILL LOOKING FOR USG VIEWS, 
THE MOD FOUND THE PROPOSED MOU &UNACCEPTABLE IN ITS PRESENT 
FORM, AS IT WOULD TAKE THE RELATIONSHIP TO A DIFFERENT 
LEVEL.8  EARLIER, SHE TOLD US CROATIAN POLICY WAS TO FOCUS 
ITS LIMITED RESOURCES ON REGIONAL MULTILATERAL MILITARY 
COOPERATION WITH MEMBERS OF THE QUADRILATERALE (ITALY, 
SLOVENIA, HUNGARY AND CROATIA), SPECIFICALLY THE 
MULTINATIONAL LAND FORCE (MLF), RATHER THAN CHARTER PARTNERS. 
 SHE NOTED THAT CROATIAN FORCES COULD LEARN MORE FROM THESE 
ACTIVITIES THAN FROM EXERCISES WITH NON-CONTIGUOUS, LESS 
MILITARILY ADVANCED REGIONAL PARTNERS.  GRCIC-POLIC STRESSED 
THAT THE CHARTER EMPHASIZED INDIVIDUAL PARTNERS\' PREPARATIONS 
FOR NATO AND POINTED OUT THE CROATIA WOULD BE BETTER 
POSITIONED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED IN THE 
MOU ONCE IT HAD MOVED CLOSER TO NATO.  SHE UNDERSCORED THE 
U.S. HAD A KEY ROLE IN THE \"U.S.-ADRIATIC CHARTER\" AND THAT 
GIVEN THE REGION\'S GEOGRAPHY, A U.S. SUPPORT ROLE WAS 
ESSENTIAL TO MAKING ANY PROPOSED MULTILATERAL EXERCISE 
HAPPEN. 
 
5. (C) WITH KEY MFA SUBSTANTIVE EXPERTS ON VACATION, MFA,S 
BEKIC WAS RELUCTANT TO PROVIDE ANY VIEWS ON THE MATTER, BUT 
DID STATE THAT THE MFA,S INITIAL REACTION WAS THAT THE 
ALBANIAN PROPOSAL WENT BEYOND THE INTENT OF THE CHARTER.  SHE 
    ADDED THAT IN GENERAL, CROATIA WANTED TO KEEP TO THE CHARTER 
IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND DID NOT WANT TO OVEREMPHASIZE THE 
PROCESS. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT:  WE BELIEVE THAT, DESPITE OUR INTERLOCUTORS, 
INITIAL NEGATIVE COMMENTS, CROATIA WOULD BE WILLING TO SIGN 
SOMETHING LESS THAN AN MOU TO AVOID GENERATING ILL-WILL WITH 
THE U.S.  AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, THE PECULIARITIES OF 
CROATIAN LAW WOULD ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THAT THE SABOR RATIFY 
ANY MOU, MAKING A LESS FORMAL \"MILITARY COOPERATION PLAN\" 
POLITICALLY MORE DESIRABLE.  GRCIC-POLIC,S COMMENTS ON THE 
NEED FOR U.S. LOGISTICAL SUPPORT FOR ANY CHARTER-LINKED 
EXERCISES SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  WITHOUT SUCH ASSISTANCE 
ONLY BILATERAL CROATIAN-ALBANIAN NAVAL EXERCISES WOULD BE 
PRACTICAL GIVEN CHARTER MEMBERS LACK OF TRANSPORT ASSETS FOR 
GROUND FORCES.  WE BELIEVE THE U.S. SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
ENCOURAGE COOPERATION, BUT LEAVE IT TO THE CHARTER PARTNERS 
TO WORK OUT WHAT FORMS THIS SHOULD TAKE.

SUBJECT: CROATIA CONDITIONALLY READY TO SUPPORT NEUM SHIP 
VISIT 
 
REF: NARDI/MOON E-MAIL 8/8/03 
 
Classified By: POLOFF JUSTIN FRIEDMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 B & D 
 
1. (U) See action request for Embassy Sarajevo para 9. 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY:  We provided the MFA and MoD with a non-paper 
(text para 10) outlining our request for support for the 
visit of a U.S. military vessel to the BiH port of Neum.  The 
MFA believes legal issues will need to be worked through 
before there is a formal OK, but appeared to be predisposed 
to cooperate.  Overall, Croatia understands the importance of 
supporting the visit, and the MOD appears ready to take the 
lead to make the visit a success.  The Croatians will want 
the GoBiH to send a Dipnote requesting cooperation to execute 
the visit. 
 
3. (C) The Embassy will need to provide the MoD with a 
detailed, written request for support, as is standard for 
ship visits to Croatia, according to our MoD contacts, in 
order for the GoC to say we have met the requirements of 
Croatian law.  The GoC wants to take the lead in announcing 
its support for the visit to manage any possible political 
impact on the upcoming November parliamentary elections.  The 
MoD would also like to arrange a formal protocol meeting for 
Deputy Defense Minister Zlatko Gareljic and Navy Commander 
Rear Admiral Zdravko Kardum with Admiral Johnson at an 
appropriate time during the Admiral,s visit to the region. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
4. (C) POLITICAL IMPORTANCE: On August 12, Poloff and Navy 
Attache delivered a non-paper (para 8) to the MFA and MoD 
outlining our request for support for the visit of a U.S. 
military vessel in late September to the BiH port of Neum. 
We met separately with MFA Acting Director of the North 
America Desk Andrea Bekic and Assistant Minister of Defense 
Jelena Grcic-Polic.  Both interlocutors recognized the 
political importance of the visit for regional cooperation. 
We stressed that Croatia needed this visit to be a success 
for our bilateral relationship as well, given recent 
disappointments of Croatia,s position on the war in Iraq and 
Article 98. 
 
5. (C) PUBLIC RELATIONS: Grcic-Polic and Bekic cautioned that 
the visit would be very politically sensitive within Croatia 
given upcoming parliamentary elections (November 23rd). 
Grcic-Polic noted that different timing for a visit could 
ease PR concerns, but she understood our need to have this 
visit now.  Grcic-Polic suggested that Croatia take the lead 
in announcing support well ahead of the visit as part of its 
efforts to improve regional cooperation.  We stated our 
willingness to work with the GoC to manage any public 
announcements, emphasizing our need to hold back on 
announcing a specific date for force protection reasons. 
 
6. (C) LEGAL CONCERNS: MFA,s Bekic cautioned that this was a 
new situation for Croatia and that we would need to work 
within Croatian law.  She was particularly concerned about 
the precedent our visit would set for other foreign military 
vessels making passage through Croatian territorial waters to 
reach the Bosnian port.  Navy Attache stressed our position 
that the U.S. was not obligated under the Law of the Sea to 
provide advance notice of our vessel,s passage, but given 
that we would need to procure considerable Croatian 
logistical support and yet to be fully defined security 
support, we wanted to work together to ensure that Croatian 
legal concerns are not an impediment to a good visit. 
 
7. (C) Assistant Minister of Defense Grcic-Polic echoed 
Bekic,s concerns, but offered work-arounds.  She said that a 
Dipnote from the GoBiH requesting security and logistic 
assistance would be helpful to cast the visit in terms of 
regional cooperation.  She said she would also want the 
standard fax or an informal note from the Embassy detailing 
our requests for assistance; such a document could be 
\"craftily\" considered as meeting Croatian legal requirements. 
 She said the MoD was willing and prepared to support the 
visit and wanted to work out the details well in advance. 
Once we outlined our requests, she would stand up an 
interagency task force (Ministry of Defense, Ministy of the 
Interior - Police and Ministry of Transportation) to address 
our support needs. 
 
8. (C) INVITATION FOR ADMIRAL JOHNSON: Grcic-Polic said that 
 
 
Deputy Defense Minister Zlatko Gareljic would be in charge of 
Croatia,s support effort since Minister Antunovic would be 
in China at the end of September.  She asked for a formal 
meeting for the Deputy Minister and the Chief of the Navy, 
Rear Admiral Zdravko Kardum, with Admiral Johnson at an 
appropriate time during the ship visit.  Navy Attache 
suggested that the proposed meeting in Split at the end of 
the visit might best serve protocol needs, depending on the 
Admiral\'s scheduled arrival and departure. 
 
9. (C) COMMENT and ACTION REQUEST: Grcic-Polic has offered us 
a good work-around on legal issues for the visit.  We 
understand that the GoBiH was making formal contact with the 
GoC simultaneous with our calls on the Croats.  Post suggests 
that Embassy Sarajevo check with the GoBiH to determine 
whether the kind of note Grcic-Polic suggested is possible. 
We will continue our work with the MoD and MFA to provide the 
Croatians our detailed support needs. 
 
10. (C) BEGIN NON-PAPER TEXT: 
 
The BiH State Presidency has invited the United States Navy 
to conduct the first-ever friendly ship visit to Neum, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This visit is projected to occur in late 
Sep 2003. 
 
In the spirit of regional cooperation, the United States 
Government seeks the assistance to of the Government of 
Croatia in provision of security and logistic support 
critical for the success of this historic visit. 
 
The United States Navy seeks the assistance of the Croatian 
Ministry of Defense and Ministry of the Interior to provide 
force protection at sea and on the landward approaches to 
Neum. If provided, the United States Navy can abide by agreed 
upon force protection measures for its ships while sailing in 
Croatian waters. Standard compensation can be provided to the 
Ministry of the Interior for services rendered. The 
Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and United States Navy 
will be responsible for force protection once the ship enters 
BiH waters. 
 
The United States Navy plans to engage Croatian-based 
husbanding agents to provide logistic support for the ship. 
We intend to use Croatian personnel (pilots, agents, etc.) 
and maritime resources (tugs, lighters, barges, etc.) drawn 
from Ploce, Croatia to support this visit due to the lack of 
adequate maritime infrastructure at Neum. 
 
We anticipate the need to utilize Croatian airports (Split 
and/or Dubrovnik) and roadways to facilitate the movement of 
personnel (including VIPs) and supplies to and from Neum, in 
the case of a medical evacuation, and to conduct tours to 
Croatia. These movements will require your cooperation in 
expediting border crossings. 
 
The current Croatian Maritime Code is silent on the 
possibility of freedom of transit by international traffic to 
Neum.  Based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and 
customary international law, diplomatic notification is not 
required to conduct right of innocent passage within a 
states, territorial seas nor within base lines defining 
internal waters which deny access to other states, 
territorial seas, as contained in the current Maritime Code. 
In making these request we do not prejudice our rights under 
international law, but hope that our Governments can work 
together to make this historic visit a success for regional 
cooperation.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR ENGAGES ON KEY BILATERAL ISSUES WITH 
FM, DEPUTY FM, AND CROATIAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S. 
 
REF: ZAGREB 01797 
 
Classified By: Poloff Justin Friedman, reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C): With the political class returning from the Dalmatian 
coast, the Ambassador had separate tour d\'horizon meetings 
this week with Foreign Minister Picula, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Simonovic, and Croatian Ambassador to the U.S. 
Grdesic to re-energize work on some key issues that have lain 
largely dormant over the summer vacation season.  FM Picula 
said he has given his staff a two week deadline to develop a 
serious proposal on an Article 98 agreement, as he 
understands a meeting at the Department around his UN UNGA 
visit will depend on real progress in this key area.  The 
Ambassador stressed that we needed to see concrete, positive 
steps on this issue to help steer the bilateral relationship 
back on track. 
 
2. (C) FM Picula said that the GoC wants to use the planned 
visit of a U.S. Navy ship to the BiH port of Neum in 
September to show that Croatia can work with the U.S.  The 
Ambassador stated bluntly that the real measure of Croatian 
cooperation with the ICTY will be General Ante Gotovina\'s 
transfer to The Hague.  On refugee returns, the GoC must work 
to harmonize its statistics with its neighbors\' and the 
international community\'s so that we can have a clear 
understanding of what kind of progress has been achieved. 
Picula said that Croatia was trying to build more cooperative 
relations with BiH and Slovenia, but the GOC\'s initiatives 
were being spun the wrong way in the Slovenian and BiH press. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
ARTICLE 98 
---------- 
 
3. (C) The Ambassador met with Deputy Foreign Minister 
Simonovic on August 26 and with Foreign Minister Picula and 
Croatian Ambassador to the U.S. Grdesic (separately) on 
August 27.  The Ambassador\'s calls were simultaneous to a 
flurry of press reporting suggesting that Croatia had made a 
new offer to the U.S. on Article 98.  DFM Simonovic clarified 
that the GoC\'s approach was still the same.  Croatia could 
accept an agreement where the U.S. agrees to start some form 
of U.S. investigative or judicial proceeding against an 
accused person which would allow Croatia to halt extradition 
of that individual to the ICC.  Simonovic said further expert 
level discussions could work out what phase or what kind of 
U.S. process would be needed to satisfy Croatian legal 
concerns.  Subsequently, FM Picula told the Ambassador that 
he had charged his experts with coming up with a new, 
creative proposal in the next two weeks. 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador commented to Picula that Croatia\'s 
position on the Article 98 issue and the Iraq war remained 
prominent in Washington\'s thinking about the U.S.-Croatia 
relationship.  The GoC would need to take a series of steps 
to change this thinking and get the bilateral relationship 
moving forward.  He cautioned Picula that U.S. views on 
Article 98 were clear and had not changed, and it would be 
important for the GoC to present to the U.S. a meaningful 
proposal. 
 
5. (C) Picula asked where discussions on Article 98 stood 
with the EU, as their position was key.  The GoC is under the 
impression that the UK and Italy are pushing the EU to bring 
forward a position that would permit members to conclude 
Article 98 agreements with the U.S.  Such a move would 
facilitate Croatia,s efforts to conclude an Article 98 
agreement.  The Ambassador commented that Croatia would have 
to come to its own decision on an Article 98 agreement in the 
context of its relationship with the EU, but noted that it 
was hard to believe that this single issue could decide 
Croatia\'s membership prospects, particularly when other 
countries seeking EU membership had signed Article 98 
agreements with the U.S. 
 
NEUM SHIP VISIT 
--------------- 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador stressed in all his meetings that by 
clearly demonstrating its support for the U.S. Navy ship 
visit to the BiH port of Neum, Croatia can help steer the 
U.S.-Croatia relationship back on track.  FM Picula said the 
GoC was ready to support the ship visit, and and asked that 
the U.S. request for specific GoC assistance to support the 
ship visit be conveyed in writing.  DFM Simonovic told the 
Ambassador that the GoC was satisfied with the BiH dipnote 
(generated by the GoBiH subsequent to reftel) requesting 
assistance for the U.S. ship visit.  (COMMENT: Given the lack 
of BiH maritime infrastructure or support services at Neum, 
Croatian support will be critical to the success of the ship 
 
 
visit.  END COMMENT). 
 
IRAQ TROOP CONTRIBUTION 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) Picula said that the MFA was working with the MoD to 
prepare the appropriate documentation for the Sabor to begin 
consideration of a Croatian contribution to coalition forces 
in Iraq.  He said the decision document would be submitted to 
the Sabor for approval in the regular session beginning 
September 15.  He predicted approval prior to parliamentary 
elections expected on November 23.  Picula asked the 
Ambassador\'s assistance in lobbying for support of key Sabor 
deputies.  Picula observed that a new UNSC resolution thought 
to be under consideration that would go beyond UNSCR 1500 
would make the GoC political position easier. 
 
EU ACCESSION 
------------ 
 
8. (C) Simonovic noted that political conditionalities on EU 
membership will drive much of the next government\'s 
post-election actions, including cooperation with ICTY, 
refugee returns, and justice system improvements.  He noted 
that the UK was being very tough on Croatia, making its 
approval of the EU SAA contingent on the surrender of General 
Ante Gotovina to the ICTY.  Simonovic hoped that Prime 
Minister Racan\'s upcoming visit to London in September would 
help smooth out this problem and facilitate UK approval of 
the SAA. 
 
ICTY 
---- 
 
9. (C) DFM Simonovic commented that the timing of the next 
ICTY indictments could affect the political situation in 
Croatia, but observed that the GoC would be able to handle it 
even if the announcement came before the elections.  He asked 
if the international community\'s impression of GoC 
cooperation had changed.  The ambassador warned bluntly that 
the international community\'s perception is that the GoC is 
not doing enough to capture Gotovina and transfer him to The 
Hague.  That Gotovina could grant an interview with a leading 
Croatian weekly magazine and pose for photos for the cover 
made it hard for the international community to believe that 
Gotovina simply could not be found.  The message to Gotovina 
must be clear that his only choice is to appear in The Hague. 
 Anything else will hold up EU accession and just about 
everything else Croatia wants with the international 
community.  Simonovic responded that the international 
community\'s perception of Croatia on this issue was \"worse 
than I thought.\" 
 
REFUGEE RETURNS 
--------------- 
 
10. (C) When asked about the international community\'s 
perception on refugee returns, the Ambassador observed that 
because of poor record keeping and a lack of agreement on 
definitions for categories of returnees made it imperative 
that the GoC get the basic issue of how to count returnees 
resolved with its neighbors and the international community. 
Until that happens, we would never be able to agree on what 
the remaining tasks are.  Simonovic hoped that President 
Mesic\'s upcoming trip to Belgrade will help Croatia\'s image 
on this issue.  The Ambassador responded that the 
international community is looking for measurable progress, 
and the consensus is that we are not there yet. 
 
RELATIONS WITH SLOVENIA 
----------------------- 
 
11. (C)  Simonovic complained that relations with Slovenia 
are burdened by Slovenia\'s emotional approach to key issues 
like the GoC plan to declare an exclusive economic zone 
(EEZ).  He noted that the Italians have the rational approach 
of wanting to preserve a sustainable fishery for their own 
fleet and are ready to talk about options, including an EEZ, 
to prevent non-European vessels from devastating the Adriatic 
fishery.  Working with Slovenia was much more difficult as 
the GoS will not say directly what it wants and keeps linking 
an EEZ with the issue of access to the high seas.  He 
admitted that poor GoC diplomacy had led to the initialed 
(but unratifiable) agreement on Piran Bay which, despite 
having no legal standing, had created political expectations 
in Slovenia and Croatia that were hard to overcome. 
Simonovic believes that arbitration may be the only long-run 
way to depoliticize and resolve the EEZ issue, as well as 
border delimitation and the Ljubljanska Banka issue. 
 
RELATIONS WITH BOSNIA 
--------------------- 
 
12. (C) Simonovic observed that the GoC was finally finding 
 
 
the right level of engagement with BiH and now believes it 
can play a positive role in Bosnia.  However, he was unhappy 
how the corridor 5C roadway issue was developing.  Simonovic 
commented that some in BiH are using this issue to claim the 
GoC is back to its old ways of meddling in BiH internal 
affairs.  He feared the GoC response will be to become once 
again too \"hands-off.\"  Croatia was on the \"side of the 
angels\" on the 5C corridor; the real issue is that BiH 
authorities are letting the whole tendering process smell of 
corruption.

SUBJECT: ICTY PUSHES CROATIAN COOPERATION IN NON-PAPER 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Justin Friedman, reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
1. (SBU) ICTY representative Thomas Osorio provided us on 
September 1 a copy of the non-paper (text para 3) which he 
had just delivered to the GoC.  Osorio told us that this 
paper was part of the Prosecutor\'s strategy of providing 
maximum transparency to Croatia on outstanding issues in 
advance of her October report to the Security Council on 
Croatia\'s cooperation with the ICTY. 
 
2. (C) Osorio added that he had been asked by the 
prosecutor\'s office to work \"intensively\" with Croatian 
authorities to ensure improved cooperation in coming months. 
He stressed, however, that despite rumors to the contrary, 
there were absolutely no negotiations going on with anybody 
in or outside the GoC to facilitate the surrender of indicted 
war criminal Ante Gotovina. 
 
3. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OF NON-PAPER: 
Non-Paper 
August 2003 
 
Co-operation between Croatia and the OTP (ICTY) 
 
Croatia,s co-operation with the OTP has improved since the 
last visit of the Prosecutor to Zagreb in April 2003; the 
Government made certain efforts to resolve the outstanding 
issues. There are, however, segments where co-operation is 
still not fully sufficient and causes concerns in the light 
of the ICTY,s Completion Strategy, recently endorsed by the 
UN Security Council (Resolution 1503). Full co-operation with 
the OTP is one of the fundamental prerequisites for the 
success of the ICTY,s Completion Strategy. 
 
At this stage, the Prosecutor decided to circulate this 
Non-paper to the Government and the relevant States taking 
into account her briefing to the UN Security Council expected 
in October. In the OTP,s view it is possible to resolve all 
or the majority of the remaining outstanding issues in the 
near future, allowing the Prosecutor to state Croatia,s full 
compliance with the OTP,s requests. 
 
Arrest and transfer of the indictees still at large 
 
At the moment there is one fugitive at large * Ante 
Gotovina, who is, according to available sources, believed to 
be in Croatia (or in adjacent areas of Herzegovina in BH). 
Interviews with this fugitive have been published in Croatia 
on a number of occasions lately, despite official claims that 
nobody knows where he is hiding. The Prosecutor expressed on 
a number of occasions her disappointment in regard to the way 
in which the Croatian Government had handled the case of 
Gotovina. It is fundamentally important that the Government 
undertakes pro-active efforts to locate and arrest Gotovina. 
It is not acceptable that the Government, as it seems, has 
chosen to wait passively for \"somebody\" to provide 
information on his location or for Gotovina himself to decide 
to surrender. 
 
UN SC Resolution 1503 &urges Member States to consider 
imposing measures against individuals and groups or 
organisations assisting indictees at large to continue to 
evade justice8. The reported efforts of the Government in 
this respect under Rule 591 (in April this year) (FOOTNOTE: 
Rule 59 provides that a State shall report to the Registrar 
its inability to execute the arrest warrant and the reasons 
thereof. Failure to report on actions taken may lead to 
report by the President to the Security Council. END 
FOOTNOTE.) are not sufficient, and in any event the 
Government is required to report regularly to the Registrar 
on the actions taken in this respect. 
 
All in all the situation with Gotovina gives rise to concerns 
about ability of the Government to control the special 
services and to act without undue delay upon any new 
indictments issued by the ICTY. It is encouraging though that 
the Government expressed to the Prosecutor a commitment to 
act immediately upon any new indictment/ arrest warrant. 
 
Requests for documents, access to archives and availability 
of witnesses. 
 
On the positive side, for a long time now the situation with 
interviews by the OTP of potential witnesses and suspects 
could be assessed in positive terms. The Government was 
effective and co-operation in this respect is progressing 
well (with some rare and minor problems with some specific 
persons to be interviewed). 
 
The situation with the access to the documentary evidence and 
archives has additionally improved but is not fully 
satisfactory. The OTP has had access or obtained documents 
from a number of locations/ archives in Croatia (including 
Government Ministries, Office of the President, HVO archive 
in the State Archive of Croatia and others). The Croatian 
 
authorities also allowed on-site reviews of certain important 
collections of documents. 
 
In July 2003 the OTP conducted a comprehensive review of all 
its Requests for Assistance and Information (RFA-s). On 7 
August the results of this review, with clear, detailed and 
concise benchmarks, were provided to the Head of the Croatian 
Government,s Office for Co-operation with the ICTY and the 
ICJ, Mr. F. Krnic. 
 
The Croatian side was informed about 16 RFAs regarded on 7 
August outstanding (partially answered, or in some cases 
requiring further discussions). Some of the RFAs are two 
years old. Without going into the details of the outstanding 
RFAs (or part of RFAs), which were presented to the 
authorities and have been discussed on a number of occasions, 
it is important to stress that OTP Requests are precise and 
specific. The follow up discussions with the authorities have 
also clarified additionally the OTP,s needs. The above 
mentioned outstanding Requests deal with the following 
topics: identified Military units and their specific 
documentation; specific reports of the Croatian Ministry of 
Defence during a limited period of times documentation of the 
late Defence Minister G. Susak; specific Bank records; 
specific information of the Croatian Intelligence community; 
specific documents in regard to the Operation &Storm8; 
specific statistical data from the 1991 census; and with some 
other matters. It is also expected by the OTP that the 
Croatian authorities respond to the RFAs in good faith with 
substantial materials, and completely responsive to the 
subject matter of the RFAs. Unfortunately, it is not always 
the case. 
 
War crimes cases in the local courts. 
 
In view of the ICTY,s Completion Strategy, the importance of 
local war crimes investigations and prosecutions gains 
special significance. The UN SC Resolution 1503 additionally 
stresses importance of &the strengthening of national 
judicial systems8 to the rule of law in general and to the 
implementation of the ICTY Completion Strategy and notes \"the 
obligation ... of the countries of the former Yugoslavia to 
investigate those accused whose cases would not be tried by 
the ICTY and take appropriate action with respect to 
indictment and prosecution, while bearing in mind the primacy 
of the ICTY over national courts8. 
 
It could be stated at this stage that, despite the fact that 
a number of war crimes cases have already been processed, 
only one serious war crimes trial has been conducted with the 
first serious result - the Norac-Oreskovic & al. trial in 
Rijeka. However, the written verdict in this case has not 
been issued yet and the case is under appeal. Some other 
cases (like Lora prison case in Split) were not so 
successful. The OTP has already established very positive 
relations with the office of the Croatian State Attorney Mr. 
M. Bajic (the OTP assisted and will assist more in some 
particular war crimes investigations and prosecutions 
launched by Bajic,s office, which has already issued first 
indictments for war crimes). However, it is expected that 
Croatia demonstrate that it is serious about pursuing all war 
crimes suspects in Croatia, regardless of the nationality of 
the perpetrators or victims. 
 
The Government has introduced a draft law on the Special war 
crimes Court(s) which, however, mainly deals with the ICC. In 
general, this draft law is designed to facilitate Croatian 
assistance to the ICC and aims at a more general reform of 
the domestic legal system so as to better carry out domestic 
prosecutions of war crimes cases. The draft also envisages 
cases being remitted to Croatia by the ICTY, but the terms 
and procedures of taking over the cases and evidence are 
unclear. Another interesting feature is that in many 
respects, this draft seems superior to existing Croatian 
legislation designed to facilitate cooperation with the ICTY.

SUBJECT:  CROATIA ABOUT TO COMPLETE EU QUESTIONNAIRE, SAYS OUTGOING DEPUTY MINISTER OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION 
 
1.  ALTHOUGH ICTY COMPLIANCE COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS, CROATIA 
IS WELL ON TRACK IN ITS EUROPEAN INTEGRATION EFFORTS.  THAT 
IS WHAT OUTGOING DEPUTY MINISTER OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, 
MIRJANA MLADINEO, TOLD US AUGUST 28, ON HER LAST DAY ON THE 
JOB.  SHE STARTS SOON IN BRUSSELS AS AMBASSADOR TO 
CROATIA\'S EU MISSION.  SHE TOLD US THAT LINE MINISTRIES 
GENERALLY KEPT INTERNAL GOC DEADLINES TO COMPLETE THE 
CANDIDACY QUESTIONNAIRE DELIVERED BY ROMANO PRODI IN EARLY 
JULY.  THE WORK OF THE MINISTRIES, SHE SAID, WILL BE VETTED 
    BY OCTOBER AND DELIVERED TO BRUSSELS SHORTLY THEREAFTER. 
SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME 29 QUESTIONS, COVERING MOSTLY 
ECONOMIC STRATEGIES, HAD BEEN SENT BACK TO THE RELEVANT 
MINISTRIES FOR MORE WORK -- BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE WORK 
WAS ON TIME. 
 
2.  STRESSING CROATIA\'S NEED TO KEEP AMBITIOUS DEADLINES IN 
ORDER TO MOVE THE PROCESS ALONG, MLADINEO SAID SHE HOPED 
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WOULD APPROVE CROATIA\'S CANDIDACY 
BY APRIL 2004 -- A TIMELINE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE GOC TO 
START NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EU BY THE FOLLOWING FALL. 
TIMING IS CRITICAL, SHE STRESSED; CROATIA WANTS TO START 
NEGOTIATIONS BEFORE THE ACCESSION OF ANOTHER TEN NEW MEMBER 
COUNTRIES SET FOR NEXT SPRING.  MLADINEO GAVE CREDIT TO THE 
GOVERNMENT FOR THE PACE OF ITS WORK: IT HAS ACCOMPLISHED 
THE COMPREHENSIVE TASK OF ANSWERING THOUSANDS OF QUESTIONS 
NEEDED FOR ITS EU CANDIDACY IN A MATTER OF MONTHS IN AN 
ELECTION YEAR.  FOR ITS PART, THE PARLIAMENT HAS ADJUSTED 
TO EU STANDARDS SOME FIFTY LAWS IN TIMELY FASHION, MANY 
OVER RECENT WEEKS.  THOSE INCLUDE THE LABOR ACT, BROADCAST 
MEDIA ACT, ANTI-MONOPOLY ACT, FOOD ACT, AND GENDER EQUALITY 
ACT. 
 
DARK CLOUD 
---------- 
 
3.  THE BIGGEST CLOUD ON THE HORIZON, MLADINEO CONCEDED, 
WAS THE STABILIZATION AND ACCESSION AGREEMENT (SAA) -- 
WHICH HAS STILL NOT BEEN RATIFIED BY THE UK AND THE 
NETHERLANDS; THEY ARE HOLDING OUT OVER CROATIA\'S HANDLING 
OF ITS ICTY OBLIGATIONS.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER REGRETTED 
    INCLUSION OF CROATIA\'S LEADING INDICTED WAR CRIMINAL, ANTE 
GOTOVINA, BY NAME NEXT TO MLADIC AND KARADZIC IN THE RECENT 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION OVER THE TRIBUNAL\'S WORK.  THIS 
WAS UNHELPFUL AND UNFAIR, SHE SAID -- ADDING, HOWEVER, 
THAT, EVEN IF FULL SAA RATIFICATION IS DELAYED OVER 
CROATIA\'S RECORD ON COOPERATION WITH THE ICTY, THE WORK OF 
HER MINISTRY WOULD MOVE IN PARALLEL TO THE SAA PROCESS. 
(THE BRITISH CHARGE CONFIRMED TO US AUGUST 29 THAT, IN 
PRACTICAL TERMS, THE EC WOULD NOT LIKELY ACT POSITIVELY ON 
CROATIA\'S APPLICATION, THE \"AVIS,\" BEFORE THE SAA IS 
RATIFIED BY ALL EU MEMBERS.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4.  THE POLITICAL CHOREOGRAPHY OF CROATIA\'S EU BID IS 
LOOKING A BIT MORE AWKWARD THAN IT DID A FEW MONTHS AGO. 
WHAT PM RACAN WANTS TO DO IS GET THE EU QUESTIONNAIRE 
COMPLETED AND DELIVERED TO BRUSSELS IN TIME TO CALL 
ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE WIDELY EXPECTED IN NOVEMBER.  WHILE 
THE EC BUREAUCRACY ASSESSES WHAT WILL BE THOUSANDS OF PAGES 
OF DOCUMENTATION, RACAN AND HIS CURRENT COALITION PARTNERS 
WOULD CAMPAIGN -- TRUMPETING THE PRIORITY THEY PLACE ON 
EUROPEAN INTEGRATION.  HOWEVER, UNLESS ALL CURRENT EU 
MEMBER STATES RATIFY THE SAA, RACAN WILL HAVE SOME 
EXPLAINING TO DO.  AND BY NEXT YEAR, THE 10 NEW MEMBERS 
COULD IN EFFECT BE HANDED, AS CURRENT MEMBERS HAVE, A VETO 
OVER CROATIA\'S SAA.  RACAN MAY BRISTLE AT THIS PROSPECT -- 
PARTICULARLY WITH RELATIONS WITH SLOVENIA LOOKING 
INCREASINGLY STRAINED OVER A MARITIME DISPUTE.

SUBJECT: TENSIONS MOUNT OVER CROATIAN INTENT TO DECLARE EEZ 
IN ADRIATIC 
 
Classified By: Economic Officer Isabella Detwiler for reasons 1.5 b and 
 d 
 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (C) Relations between Croatia and Slovenia have taken 
another downward plunge over Croatia\'s announced intention to 
declare an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Adriatic Sea. 
 The Slovenian ambassador to Croatia has apparently been 
recalled.  The Croatian MFA presented the Croatian point of 
view to the diplomatic corps in Zagreb September 2, arguing 
that Croatia was within its rights to declare an EEZ, while 
it fully intended to consult with Slovenia and other 
interested parties.  Meanwhile, the Slovenian Economic 
Counselor in Zagreb attributed the strong Slovenian reaction 
to a mixture of built-up fatigue at the lack of 
professionalism of Croatian diplomacy and concern over 
possible economic losses in fisheries and natural gas 
exploration.  End Summary. 
 
Greener than Thou 
----------------- 
2.  (SBU) Deputy Foreign Minister Simonovic passed two 
non-papers to the assembled diplomatic corps September 2 (to 
be transmitted septel.  The MFA apparently called the meeting 
in response to a similar meeting called by the MFA in 
Ljubljana the day before).  He described the Croatian 
proposal to declare an EEZ as motivated principally by a 
concern for the environment of the Adriatic and especially 
fisheries.  He described alternative proposals for fishery 
zones or ecological zones as insufficent and not clearly 
defined under international law.  Simonovic made no mention 
of exploitation of gas deposits, although in one of the 
non-papers, the GOC asserts that the 1968 Agreement between 
Italy and SFRY delimits rights concerning exploration and 
exploitation of natural resources of the sea-bed (we will 
seek clarification). 
 
\"Irrational Escalation\" 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  Simonovic denied that the GOC had refused to 
consult with the government of Slovenia on the issue, and 
instead accused the GoS of delaying consultations, then 
downgrading the level of representation at the upcoming 
September 16 meeting to a level which would not help to move 
the process forward.  He claimed Croatia had even previewed 
the EEZ concept to all the relevant parties in Athens June 
19-20 at a preparatory meeting for the EU Summit.  No 
objections were registered.  For Slovenia to be crying foul 
now was \"an irrational escalation\" of the issue. 
 
4.  (SBU) In what may be the key area of dispute, the GOC 
argued that Slovenia does not have the right to declare an 
EEZ, apparently because Slovenia\'s territorial seas are 
hemmed in on all sides by Italian and Croatian territorial 
waters -- an assertion that Slovenia contests, based mostly 
on historic access to the open sea.  Simonovic pooh-poohed 
the Slovenian assertion that no EEZ could be declared without 
Ljubljana\'s consent and without ratification of the moribund 
Croatian-Slovenian border agreement.  This agreement was 
initialed in 2001 on the Prime Minister\'s personal 
instructions on the Croatian side by the head of border 
commission.  However, it was repudiated formally by the 
government of Croatia after it received a hostile reception 
by the public and the parliament. 
 
Par for the Course for a \"Banana Republic\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) In a previously scheduled meeting on September 2 with 
the Slovenian economic counselor in Zagreb, Riana Benko, we 
heard quite a different story.  Benko passed over a Slovenian 
 
 
non-paper on the issue (faxed to desk, L and OES).  Benko 
decried what she described as just the latest in unneighborly 
acts by Croatia.  She listed the failure of Croatia to ratify 
the border agreement with Slovenia as just one of a series of 
unfulfilled commitments.  Croatia was not acting seriously, 
she stressed, but rather like a \"banana republic.\"  Slovenia 
was informed of important initiatives through the media, 
rather than official channels (comment: we have experienced 
the same pattern of communication ourselves). 
 
6.  (C) Benko made a perhaps contradictory argument that 
Slovenia recognizes that Croatia has a right to declare an 
EEZ, but it has the duty to consult first (the non-paper is 
more categorical that \"the Republic of Slovenia has 
throughout advocated the view that the proclamation of an 
exclusive economic zone requires the consent by all the 
states concerned.\"  Benko said Slovenia was historically a 
seafaring nation, and would not have its traditional \"sea\" 
reduced to a \"lake.\"  She freely admitted that Slovenia had 
interests not only in fisheries and the environment, but 
perhaps \"most importantly,\" in possible gas deposits in the 
Northern Adriatic (Croatia\'s INA and Italian Agip are 
currently exploring for gas in areas somewhat to the south of 
the intersection of extensions of Croatian, Italian and 
Slovenian borders).  Benko sounded genuinely hurt by 
Croatia\'s perceived ingratitude for all of Slovenia\'s help 
with Croatia\'s EU accession, and noted that such help could 
be affected by Croatia\'s actions on the EEZ. 
 
7.  (C) We asked if she was heartened by the meeting of 
experts scheduled for September 16.  Benko expressed 
pessimism, because she felt the GOC had made it difficult, 
politically, to take a step back and compromise.  In its 
non-paper, the GOS states \"the proposed level of heads of 
legal departments is presently sufficient.  There is no need 
for political meetings that could later be interpreted by 
Croatia as consultations with the Republic of Slovenia.\" 
What then did Slovenia seek?  Benko said all five countries 
involved (Italy, Slovenia, SaM, Croatia and Albania) should 
consult and come up with a way to share the resources.  We 
asked if the EU supported this approach.  Benko hesitated, 
then ventured that \"one member -- Italy -- has its own 
interests.\" 
 
EU Keeping Out of It, Sort of 
----------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) We asked a contact at the EU mission for its view on 
the brouhaha.  Martin Mayer, political advisor, noted the EU 
did not have competence in the area of EEZs, which were 
authorized by the UN in the 1982 Convention on the Law of the 
Seas.  The EU recognized the right of states to declare an 
EEZ, but felt it should be done in consultation with affected 
states.  The EU had offered to mediate if asked by both 
parties, recognizing there were no clear legal guidelines. 
Mayer hoped that an EU conference on Mediterrean fisheries in 
November would be another forum for discussion with various 
parties. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) Although the Croatians may have dropped the 
diplomatic ball, they do seem to have a fair legal case.  The 
Croatians and Slovenians will have to work this out among 
themselves, although an EU offer to mediate may help.

Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (C) On September 3, the Slovenian Charge called upon the 
DCM to deliver a fairly low-key pitch that the U.S. and EU 
help \"create the atmosphere\" for a resolution over the 
conflict over the Croatian intention to announce an exclusive 
economic zone (EEZ) in the Adriatic.  In a presentation that 
seemed to mix personal opinion with instructions from 
Ljubljana, he downplayed Slovenian economic interests, 
instead emphasizing Slovene concerns over access to open seas 
and a belief that Croatia intended to use the EEZ declaration 
as an attempt to strengthen its hand in the still-unresolved 
negotiation of a sea and land border agreement. 
 
2.  (C) In a separate meeting with the Croatian MFA, the head 
of the Legal Department assured us that an EEZ would not 
cause problems in navigation (including for warships), and 
would not affect existing Slovene-Croatian fishing 
agreements.  Our interlocutor said discussions were ongoing, 
and that no definite decision had been made to declare an EEZ 
as opposed to an ecological and/or environmental zone.  End 
Summary 
 
EEZ and Border Agreement -- Separate but Linked 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3.  (C) On September 4, Slovenian Charge Hocevar called on 
the DCM.  He noted that the Slovenian non-paper on the EEZ 
issue, presented to an embassy colleague the day before 
(faxed to EUR/SCE, L and OES), was \"already\" old, and that 
the Slovenian arguments were evolving, especially as it 
prepared for an October 22-24 meeting in Brussels and a EU 
fisheries meeting in Venice, set for November.  He emphasized 
that while the EEZ and the border agreement were legally 
separate, the main Croatian motivation in declaring the EEZ 
was to put Croatia in a stronger position in the border 
negotiation (an earlier settlement, which covered both 
maritime boundaries and some small adjustments to the land 
border, was initialed by the GOC and GOS, but repudiated by 
the GOC after meeting fierce opposition in Croatia).  Hocevar 
speculated that Croatia may also wish to cement rights over 
gas deposits. 
 
4.  (C) While conceding that the repudiated agreement was not 
legally binding, Hocevar was confident it would form the 
\"basis\" of an arbitrated agreement.  When asked if the GOS 
was willing to accept arbitration, he noted that the GOS was 
concerned about the possible partiality of a judge on the 
International Maritime Court in Hamburg, so had rejected that 
venue.  The International Court of Justice in the Hague was a 
possibility, but the GOS had not made a final decision. 
 
Electioneering 
-------------- 
 
5.  (C) Hocevar was pointed in ascribing current Croatian 
policy statements to electioneering.  He believed that Deputy 
Foreign Minister Simonovic was the architect of this 
anti-Slovenian campaign waged in the press without 
consultations with Ljubljana.  Hocevar also commented that 
the Slovenian side should lower its rhetoric, and not allow 
itself to be baited by the Croatians. 
 
\"Basic Right of Access\" 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Hocevar downplayed Slovenian economic interest in 
fisheries, guessing that there were only about 50 Slovenian 
fishermen.  However, history, the coastal way of life and 
\"tradition\" gave the sector more weight than the employment 
numbers would indicate.  The main reason for Slovenia\'s 
concern was a fear of being cut off from the open sea.  When 
the DCM noted that the Convention on the Law of the Sea 
guarantees the right of innocent passage, Hocevar replied 
that in cases of \"national emergencies,\" EEZs could be closed 
off, creating crises -- e.g., Panama under Noriega or a 
Greek-Turkish conflict that almost led to war.  Hocevar 
argued it was in the interest of all countries, including the 
U.S., to preserve as open access as possible to the high 
 
 
seas, and that it was the \"basic right\" of Slovenia to have 
access to the sea.  Slovenia would seek a joint-ecological 
zone.  \"Hopefully, Croatia will see the importance of EU and 
NATO in today\'s world,\" Hocevar concluded. 
 
A Concession Too Far 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Previously, we met with the head of the MFA\'s 
international legal department, Andreja Metelko-Zgombic.  She 
confirmed many of the points made the day earlier by the 
Deputy Minister to the diplomatic corps (ref B).  Discussing 
the repudiated border agreement, which the Slovenians believe 
enhances their rights to \"territorial access\" to the open sea 
(as opposed to merely effective access through transit 
rights), Zgombic said the agreement had been opposed even 
before its initialing by most Croatian legal experts, but had 
been a good-faith effort to promote good neighborly 
relations.  It ultimately proved to be too generous to gain 
the constitutionally required parliamentary ratification. 
The agreement, which included both sea borders and minor land 
border adjustments, would have ceded Croatian territorial 
waters to create an open sea corridor from internationally 
recognized open seas to Slovenian territorial waters.  In 
doing so, it would have cut off a triangle of Croatian 
territorial waters from the rest of Croatian jurisdiction. 
The Croatians had also negotiated some concessions on the 
land border within the same agreement, which were also not 
now operable.  Zgombic reiterated previous Croatian 
assertions that the GOC was ready to seek arbitration in any 
relevant court, including the ICJ. 
 
8.  (C) When asked to comment on Slovenian press suggestions 
for a Monaco-like solution (France ceded some territorial 
waters to Monaco to ensure Monaco\'s access to open sea), 
Zgombic noted that France \"gave\" this away -- it was not a 
right of Monaco -- and a similar approach had already been 
tried in the form of the rejected agreement and found 
politically infeasible. 
 
If Navigation, Fishing and Gas Not Issues ... 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) On practical issues, Zgombic said that existing 
fisheries treaties with Slovenia, which extend fishing rights 
in territorial waters, would continue in force (the EEZ would 
have no impact on territorial waters).  Croatia was prepared 
to negotiate special fishing rights in the EEZ for Slovenia 
as a Geographically Disadvantaged Country as provided for 
under Article 70 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
The right of innocent passage without prior notification 
through the EEZ, including for military ships, was not in 
doubt.  The memorandum recently signed by Croatia, Italy and 
Slovenia, which created counter-clockwise commercial traffic 
lanes in the Adriatic, would remain in force.  Finally, 
Zgombic looked surprised when asked if an EEZ would have any 
impact on exploitation rights of the seabed in the Adriatic. 
She noted that it is clear in law that an EEZ has no impact 
on the rights related to the underlying seabed, which are 
determined by agreements on the continental shelf, which is 
not in dispute. (Note: at least so far.) 
 
10.  (C) Zgombic claimed that no firm decisions had been made 
on the declaration of an EEZ.  The options of declaring an 
ecological zone or a fisheries zone were still in play.  She 
saw little difference between a combined fisheries/ecological 
zone, and an EEZ.  (Note: the previous day, the Deputy 
Minister had told the diplomatic corps that the GOC 
preference was for an EEZ because of its more solid legal 
base.) 
 
... Then Why the Decision? 
-------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) When asked why the government had decided to make 
this declaration of intent now, after having mulled over the 
issue publicly so long, Zgombic ventured that the EU policy 
of encouraging fishery or ecological zones had been an 
important factor, as well as evident degradation of the 
environment and decline in fish stocks.  Earlier, Croatia had 
been constrained by political considerations, including a 
perception that Italy would object to losing automatic access 
to nearby open sea.  (Comment: It is very likely Croatia 
would negotiate special fishing rights for Italy when 
delimiting the overlapping Croatian and Italian EEZ claims. 
It is also likely that Croatian elections, slated for 
 
 
November, factored in the decision; being tough on the 
Slovenians is always a political winner.  End Comment.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
12.  (C) While confident of its right to declare an EEZ, the 
GOC is aware of its obligation to consult -- but it does not 
believe that consultations need to be concluded to Slovenian 
satisfaction before it can act.  Nevertheless, the government 
has said it will not declare an EEZ precipitously.  It has 
(belatedly) sought consultations, and publicly called for the 
return of the Slovene ambassador, recalled by Ljubljana 
earlier this week.  While the GOC has mustered its legal 
arguments, it is unclear whether the GOC has considered all 
the political consequences -- especially if the GOS puts 
teeth in its alleged intimations that its support for 
Croatia\'s EU membership is at risk.  We concur with Embassy 
Ljubljana\'s recommendation that Croatia and Slovenia be 
encouraged to work this out bilaterally, or in an EU context.

SUBJECT: TIME RUNNING OUT FOR AGREEMENT ON PLOCE PORT 
 
REF: 02 ZAGREB 01295 
 
Classified By: POLOFF DARREN TAYLOR: REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) PM Racan has vowed that Croatia will ratify the Ploce 
Port Agreement by the end of September despite continued 
local and parliamentary opposition to the agreement.  GOC and 
GOBiH have met frequently in recent weeks to try to reach a 
compromise that would provide Croatia the political cover to 
move forward on ratification.  Results have been encouraging, 
but some stumbling blocks remain after the BIH side recently 
voiced concerns that the new annex negotiated by the two 
governments did not go far enough in addressing its concerns 
over the method for settling future disputes.    The Acting 
Head of the Neighboring Relations Department, Davor Vidis, 
was not optimistic: he told us that Racan appears determined 
to bring the Ploce issue to closure, but it was too early to 
tell if parliament would ratify the agreement anytime soon. 
There is growing concern that the window of opportunity to 
resolve the Ploce Port issue is closing as election season 
heats up.  End Summary. 
 
Progress on Ploce Port Agreement 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) While on an official trip to BiH in July, PM Racan 
declared that the Ploce Port agreement, first signed in 1999, 
would be resolved by the end of September.  In agreeing to an 
annex, GOC and GOBIH officials have eliminated the 
international arbiter called for in the original agreement. 
This was a central issue for the GOC because of concerns that 
the international arbiter would be part of a seven-person 
commission overseeing the port\'s activities, and would 
theoretically be able to cast the deciding vote when disputes 
arose.  The Croatians have balked because this would give a 
foreign mediator the right to make final decisions about a 
Croatian Port on Croatian territory -- in their view 
infringing on Croatia,s territorial sovereignty.  Racan and 
Picula were certain that parliament would not ratify the 
agreement in its current form and without an annex. 
 
But Time Running Out 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C) \"The window of opportunity for a final agreement on 
the Ploce Port is closing fast.\"  This is what the Acting 
Head of the Neighboring Relations Department Davor Vidis told 
us when we met with him on August 27.  Vidis claimed that GOC 
officials accompanying Racan on the BiH visit were surprised 
by his declaration because of continued local and 
parliamentary opposition to the agreement.  His reference to 
the shrinking window of opportunity to resolve Ploce is 
linked to the recent snag in the negotiations.  Last week, a 
member of the BiH presidency rejected the newly negotiated 
annex to the current agreement because it did not contain a 
specific deadline for the ratification of the agreement and 
final procedures for establishing a commission to resolve 
possible future disputes over management of the port.  Vidis 
said that GOBiH appeared to be backtracking on the annex. 
 
 
4. (C) Vidis predicted that, if the Ploce Port Agreement were 
not resolved within the next three weeks, it would languish 
until next spring -- well after Croatia\'s elections.  Foreign 
policy issues, he said, would not receive much attention 
during the campaign, and Ploce was in any case too divisive. 
He commented that key parliament officials, including Deputy 
Speaker of the Parliament Tomac, who strongly opposed 
ratifying the agreement in its current form, have not 
indicated whether they would support ratifying the Ploce 
agreement if it contained a new annex.  He noted that HSLS 
president Budisa was already causing problems by voicing his 
opposition to the agreement even if it contained the annex. 
 
The GOC Strategy 
---------------- 
 
5. (C) Vidis said the GOC strategy will be to lay low on the 
Ploce issue to allow for a \"cooling off\" period.  He stated 
that the GOC would then try to resurrect negotiations in a 
low-key fashion with the hopes of addressing GOBiH concerns 
and reaching a final agreement.  The GOC would then seek to 
have parliament ratify the agreement through urgent 
procedure.  If this strategy failed, Croatia would have no 
other option except to allow the new government to try to 
resolve the issue.  He noted that local opposition in Ploce 
to ratifying the agreement was hardening, which is also 
complicating matters and leaving the GOC little room to 
 
maneuver.  Political leaders in Ploce continued to lobby key 
members of parliament against the agreement.  He was not 
optimistic that the GOC strategy would prevail but said that 
the GOC had limited options. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) The Ploce Agreement was politically sensitive even 
before Croatia\'s disagreement with Slovenia over declaration 
of an Exclusive Economic Zone turned up the political heat on 
border issues.  In the current environment, we expect Racan 
to back away from his declaration that he will secure Ploce 
ratification in September and that this issue will languish 
until the next government takes it up.  During our meeting, 
Vidis seemed desperate to reach a final agreement with the 
GOBiH before elections.  While stressing that the GOC would 
do its part to reach an agreement in the next few weeks, 
Vidis was not convinced that GOBiH officials shared the same 
sense of urgency, particularly since the BiH parliament has 
already ratified the agreement.

1. (C) PER REFTEL A, WE HAVE PREPARED A LIST OF SPECIFIC 
INCIDENTS HIGHLIGHTING OUR CONCERNS (REF C) ABOUT ITF 
    DIRECTOR JERNEJ CIMPERSEK,S SUITABILITY TO CONTINUE IN HIS 
CURRENT POSITION: 
 
--  LAST OCTOBER, CIMPERSEK DISPLAYED UNPROFESSIONAL AND 
UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR DURING A/S BLOOMFIELD\'S VISIT TO 
CROATIA TO ATTEND A DEMINING CONFERENCE IN DUBROVNIK.  DURING 
MEETINGS WITH GOC OFFICIALS AND IN PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH U.S. 
OFFICIALS, CIMPERSEK HAD TO BE REPEATEDLY TOLD THAT HIS 
TEMPERAMENTAL AND OPENLY HOSTILE BEHAVIOR WAS NOT HELPFUL IN 
RESOLVING DISPUTES WITH SENIOR GOC OFFICIALS.  CIMPERSEK 
RESPONDED BY SIMPLY DECLARING HIS DISDAIN FOR THE GOC 
OFFICIALS INVOLVED. 
 
--  LAST NOVEMBER, WHEN POLOFF VISITED LJUBLJANA TO MEET WITH 
ITF AND PM/HDP OFFICIALS FROM WASHINGTON, WHO WERE IN TOWN TO 
ATTEND THE NIGHT OF A THOUSAND DINNERS EVENT, CIMPERSEK 
LAUNCHED AN EXPLETIVE-FILLED SCREED AT POLOFF.  HE COMPLAINED 
BITTERLY ABOUT MANY OF THE KEY DEMINING PLAYERS IN CROATIA 
AND LAUNCHED SIMILAR CRITICISMS AGAINST EMBASSY ZAGREB AND 
SENIOR USG OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON.  PM/HDP OFFICIALS WHO 
HEARD CIMPERSEK, INCLUDING THE THEN REGIONAL MANAGER FOR THE 
BALKANS WHO WAS CO-LOCATED AT ITF HEADQUARTERS, WERE SHOCKED. 
 
 
--  DURING POLOFF,S VISIT TO ITF HEADQUARTERS EARLIER THIS 
YEAR TO MEET WITH THE FORMER PM/HDP BALKANS REGIONAL MANAGER, 
CIMPERCEK AGAIN LAUNCHED INTO A TIRADE ABOUT HIS DISPLEASURE 
WITH CROATIANS AND USED EXPLETIVES TO VOICE DISGUST WITH U.S. 
OFFICIALS WHO DEMANDED THAT HE PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN 
DEALING WITH CROATIAN AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN THE DEMINING 
COMMUNITY IN THE REGION.  HIS ACTIONS PROVOKED A STRONG 
    RESPONSE FROM THE THEN REGIONAL MANAGER WHO SUGGESTED TO 
CIMPERSEK THAT HE RESIGN IF HE NO LONGER WANTED TO PERFORM 
THE DUTIES OF THE JOB. 
 
--  DURING POLOFF,S OTHER VISITS TO ITF HEADQUARTERS AND 
DURING MEETINGS IN OTHER LOCATIONS WITH CIMPERSEK, CIMPERSEK 
WOULD OPENLY STATE HIS EFFORTS TO DEFLECT ATTENTION AWAY FROM 
DEMINING PROJECTS IN CROATIA AND HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE 
SUPPORT TO CROATIA.  WHEN POLOFF TRIED TO CONVEY TO CIMPERSEK 
THAT THE USG MUST ENGAGE THE GOC IN A PROFESSIONAL AND 
DIPLOMATIC MANNER, CIMPERSEK RESPONDED THAT HE WAS SLOVENIAN 
AND DID NOT SHARE THE USG,S VIEW.  THIS WAS ALSO HIS 
ATTITUDE TOWARD OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, PARTICULARLY 
BIH AND SERBIA MONTENEGRO. 
 
--  SLOVENIAN OFFICIALS WORKING AT THE ITF HAVE CONFIDED TO 
US THAT CIMPERSEK IS UNABLE TO CONTROL HIS TEMPER AND 
OFTENTIMES THEY ARE THE VICTIMS OF HIS RAGE.  THEY HAVE 
OFFERED APOLOGIES ON HIS BEHALF.  CIMPERSEK, HOWEVER, HAS 
NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR ANY INCIDENTS AND MADE COMMITMENTS TO 
TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT\'S FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR DISCUSSES 
LIBYA, ARTICLE 98, REGIONAL RELATIONS, ICTY AND IRAQ 
 
REF: BELGRADE 2018 
 
Classified By: DCM Patrick Moon for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The DCM met September 3 with President Mesic,s new 
Foreign Policy Advisor, Ambassador Ivica Mastruko.  Mastruko 
said there had been no discussion of military-related 
projects during President Mesic,s recent trip to Libya. 
President Mesic has washed his hands of any personal efforts 
to facilitate the surrender of Croatian ICTY indictee 
Gotovina to The Hague.  Although Mesic,s upcoming first 
official visit to Belgrade would be heavy on protocol events, 
Mesic would likely meet with Croatian-Serb refugees and urge 
them to return home.  Mastruko said work was underway on an 
Article 98 proposal that Picula would present in the U.S. 
this month.  Finally, Mesic would neither promote nor 
criticize the GOC,s proposal to send a military contingent 
to Iraq.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) In our first ever meeting on September 2 with 
Ambassador Mastruko (see paras 10-11 for bio information) 
since he took over as President Mesic,s foreign policy 
advisor late last month, Mastruko emphasized the importance 
of the Croatian relationship with the U.S. and his strong 
desire to consult closely, frequently and candidly with the 
U.S. Embassy.  The DCM explained that newly arrived 
Ambassador Frank had established informal relationships with 
senior GOC officials to promote good communication and a 
better understanding of each country,s points of view. 
 
Libya 
----- 
 
3.  (C) Mastruko understood U.S. sensitivities regarding 
Croatia,s warming relations with Libya and explained that 
President Mesic,s only objective was to gain commercial 
projects for Croatian firms.  He made clear that there were 
no representatives of military-related firms on Mesic,s trip 
to Libya last month and there were no discussions of any 
military projects with the Libyans ) nothing on military 
ships, nothing on aircraft (contradicting reftel allegations 
from Yugoimport).  He did say that the Libyans expressed 
interest in using Croatian shipyards to overhaul old 
commercial vessels. 
 
4. (C) Mastruko said that Mesic had even acted on behalf of 
other countries in the region in promoting specific 
commercial projects such as the sale of Macedonian steel and 
Bosnian road building capabilities. 
 
5.  (C) However, Mastruko ended this discussion by noting 
that although Croatia would never do so, he was aware that 
Serbia and Montenegro may be considering a Libyan proposal to 
train pilots. 
 
Trip to Belgrade 
---------------- 
 
6.  (C) Mastruko said that Mesic,s upcoming first official 
trip to Belgrade would be heavy on protocol and light on 
substance.  However, Mesic was seriously considering a 
meeting with Croatian Serb refugees to urge them to return 
home. 
 
Troops to Iraq 
-------------- 
 
7.  (C) When the DCM expressed appreciation for the GOC,s 
decision to send a small military contingent to Iraq, 
Mastruko carefully observed that Mesic had agreed with PM 
Racan not to comment publicly on this proposal before the 
Sabor endorses it, which the GOC expects by the end of 
September.  Mastruko noted that there had been some criticism 
of this deployment in the press and the public did not seem 
strongly supportive.  (Comment:  We believe that President 
Mesic has reservations about deploying Croatian troops 
without a specific endorsement by the UNSC.  End comment.) 
 
Article 98 
---------- 
 
8.  (C) Mastruko confirmed that the MFA was working on two 
possible alternative approaches to an Article 98 agreement. 
One would be an extradition treaty and the other an MLAT-type 
agreement.  He said FM Picula would take the proposal to the 
U.S. this month for discussion with senior U.S. officials. 
(Comment:  It was not clear whether Mastruko was suggesting 
the proposal would include both agreements or whether the MFA 
was studying whether to propose one or the other.  End 
Comment.) 
 
 
ICTY 
---- 
 
9.  (C) In light of UNSCR 1503 and Gotovina,s failure to 
act, Mastruko said that President Mesic had dropped all his 
efforts to facilitate Gotovina,s surrender and transfer to 
the ICTY.  He was now encouraging the Ministry of Interior 
and other GOC organizations to do everything possible to 
capture Gotovina who was now &on his own.8 
 
Biographic Information 
----------------------

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) PASSAGE OF A NEW UNSCR AUTHORIZING A UN-MANDATED 
MULTINATIONAL FORCE UNDER UNIFIED U.S. COMMAND WOULD MAKE THE 
GOC\'S TASK OF SECURING PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL TO DEPLOY A 
CROATIAN CONTINGENT OF TROOPS TO IRAQ MUCH EASIER. 
DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ REMAINS POLITICALLY SENSITIVE.  WITH 
ELECTIONS EXPECTED IN NOVEMBER, THE GOC WOULD WELCOME THE 
POLITICAL COVER OF A NEW UN MANDATE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) ON JUNE 12, CROATIA\'S GOVERNMENT MADE A POLITICAL 
COMMITMENT TO DEPLOY A MILITARY CONTINGENT TO IRAQ (REF B), 
BUT PM RACAN\'S CABINET HAS NOT YET SUBMITTED A FORMAL 
DECISION TO THE PARLIAMENT FOR RATIFICATION.  A CROATIAN 
LIAISON OFFICER ARRIVED AT CENTCOM ON SEPTEMBER 3 TO GATHER 
DETAILS THE PARLIAMENT WILL REQUIRE TO APPROVE DEPLOYMENT. 
DEPLOYMENT OF FORCES TO IRAQ REMAINS VERY POLITICALLY 
SENSITIVE.  PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST DEPLOYMENT OF A CROATIAN 
CONTINGENT REMAINS HIGH, ALTHOUGH CROATIA\'S POLITICAL LEADERS 
UNDERSTAND THAT MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO COLLECTIVE SECURITY 
IS EXPECTED OF COUNTRIES WHICH ASPIRE TO NATO MEMBERSHIP. 
 
3.  (C) SPEEDY PASSAGE OF A NEW UNSCR AUTHORIZING A 
UN-MANDATED MULTINATIONAL FORCE UNDER UNIFIED U.S. COMMAND 
WOULD MAKE THE GOC\'S POLITICAL TASK MUCH EASIER.  (IN A 
SEPTEMBER 9 DISCUSSION ON OTHER ISSUES, DEPUTY FOREIGN 
MINISTER IVAN SIMONOVIC RAISED THE ISSUE OF CROATIA\'S 
POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE COALITION, AND MADE PRECISELY 
THIS POINT TO THE DCM.)  PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS ARE EXPECTED 
    IN NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR, AND LEADING COALITION POLITICIANS 
WOULD WELCOME THE ADDITIONAL POLITICAL COVER A NEW RESOLUTION 
WOULD PROVIDE.  THE GOC MAY CHOOSE TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEW 
UNSCR IS PASSED BEFORE FORWARDING ITS FORMAL DECISION ON 
DEPLOYMENT FOR PARLIAMENTARY RATIFICATION.  CROATIA\'S 
PARLIAMENT IS EXPECTED TO DISSOLVE ITSELF IN MID-OCTOBER TO 
PREPARE FOR ELECTIONS, SO A PROLONGED DEBATE OVER THE 
RESOLUTION COULD MEAN THAT CROATIAN TROOPS WOULD NOT BE 
AUTHORIZED TO JOIN THE STABILIZATION FORCE BEFORE EARLY 2004. 
 WITH CROATIA\'S EU APPLICATION NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION, THE 
GOC WOULD AVOID TAKING ANY STEP TO WHICH THEY BELIEVE KEY EU 
MEMBER STATES MIGHT OBJECT. 
 
4.  (C) WE HAVE REACHED A POINT IN OUR EFFORTS TO LOBBY 
CROATIAN POLITICIANS WHERE WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE CURRENT 
PARLIAMENT WILL APPROVE A GOC DECISION TO DEPLOY FORCES TO 
IRAQ.  HOWEVER, IF THE RACAN CABINET CHOOSES TO DELAY 
FORWARDING A FORMAL DECISION TO THE LEGISLATURE PENDING THE 
OUTCOME OF DEBATE IN THE UNSC, THE CURRENT PARLIAMENT MAY NOT 
GET A CHANCE TO VOTE.

1.   (SBU) SUMMARY: CROATIAN AUTHORITIES ARE GENERALLY 
SATISFIED WITH PRESIDENT MESIC\'S SEPTEMBER 10 TRIP TO 
BELGRADE.  THE PRESIDENT\'S FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR, ANOTHER 
MESIC STAFFER, AND THE HEAD OF THE MFA\'S EASTERN BALKANS

    TWO PRESIDENTS MAKING FROM-THE-HEART STATEMENTS OF REGRET FOR 
THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES\' WAR-TIME LEGACIES.  THE SAM 
AMBASSADOR TO CROATIA, ON HAND IN BELGRADE FOR THE VISIT, 
SAID THE SAME THING TO US ON RETURNING.  THE CROATIAN PRESS 
REPORTED SOME GRUMBLING, BUT FOR THE MOST PART THIS CAME FROM 
THE USUAL SUSPECTS IN THE OPPOSITION TRYING TO SCORE POINTS 
BEFORE ELECTIONS, EXPECTED IN NOVEMBER.  END SUMMARY 
 
HISTORIC VISIT? 
--------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) PRESIDENT MESIC\'S TRIP TO BELGRADE WENT MUCH BETTER 
THAN EXPECTED.  THIS WAS HOW DAVOR VIDIS, HEAD OF THE MFA\'S 
EASTERN BALKANS OFFICE, SUMMED IT UP DURING A MEETING 
SEPTEMBER 12.  HE TOLD US THAT THE PRESIDENT TOOK ALONG 
SEVERAL KEY PEOPLE -- INCLUDING FINANCE MINISTER CRKVENAC AND 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SIMONOVIC -- AND A LIST OF ISSUES TO 
TACKLE.  BUT TIME WAS SHORT, AND WHEN THE TWO PRESIDENTS 
EXCHANGED APOLOGIES MID-WAY DURING THE VISIT, ALL THE OTHER 
ISSUES MELTED INTO INSIGNIFICANCE.  VIDIS TERMED THE EXCHANGE 
OF APOLOGIES AN \"HISTORIC\" MOMENT IN THE RELATIONSHIP. 
 
3.  (C) MESIC\'S SENIOR FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR, IVICA 
MASTRUKO, TOLD US SEPTEMBER 12 THAT, DESPITE THE BREVITY OF 
THE VISIT, THE PRESIDENT COVERED MUCH GROUND.  THE TWO 
DELEGATIONS DISCUSSED THE DANUBE BORDER DISPUTE.  MESIC MET 
WITH A GROUP OF SERBIAN REFUGEES, AND LATER WITH A GROUP OF 
ETHNIC CROAT LEADERS FROM SERBIA\'S NORTHERN PROVINCE OF 
VOJVODINA.  MASTRUKO SAID THAT MESIC INVITED SAM PRESIDENT 
MAROVIC TO CROATIA FOR A VISIT, PREFERABLY BEFORE THE END THE 
YEAR.  THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN MESIC AND MAROVIC -- BOTH FORMER 
    COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA -- IS MUCH 
BETTER THAN THAT BETWEEN MESIC AND FORMER FRY PRESIDENT 
KOSTUNICA. 
 
4.  (C) SEPARATELY, KATARINA TRSNJAK, AN MFA OFFICIAL 
SECONDED TO MESIC\'S OFFICE, TOLD US THAT MESIC WAS SURPRISED 
BY SAM PRESIDENT MAROVIC\'S STATEMENT OF REGRET.  MAROVIC USED 
VERY STRAIGHT-FORWARD LANGUAGE, WITHOUT ANY HESITATION.  THE 
CROATIANS ON THE DELEGATION, SHE SAID, EXPECTED LANGUAGE MUCH 
LESS FORTHCOMING.  AT THE SAME TIME, MESIC\'S COMMENTS WERE 
MORE \"LEGALLY GROUNDED,\" AS SHE PUT IT, ALTHOUGH ALSO VERY 
SINCERE.  ECHOING VIDIS, TRSNJAK SAID THAT AFTER THE EXCHANGE 
OF APOLOGIES IT BECAME VERY DIFFICULT TO CONDUCT OTHER 
BUSINESS.  \"IT WAS NEITHER THE PLACE NOR THE TIME.\" 
 
OTHER REACTION 
-------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) MEANWHILE, PUBLIC REACTIONS TO THE VISIT WERE 
GENERALLY POSITIVE.  PM RACAN SAID HE \"WELCOMED\" MAROVIC\'S 
STATEMENT, WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS AN IMPORTANT SYMBOLIC 
GESTURE IN THE STATES\' BILATERAL RELATIONS.  DEFENSE MINISTER 
ANTUNOVIC SAID THE TWO PRESIDENTS\' REMARKS AUGURED WELL FOR 
EVEN BETTER RELATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  CRITICS INCLUDED 
HARD-LINE NATIONALIST IVIC PASALIC, PRESIDENT OF THE CROATIAN 
BLOCK, WHO TERMED MESIC\'S STATEMENT OF CONTRITION 
\"DISGRACEFUL,\" AND MAROVIC\'S \"INADEQUATE.\"  HDZ VICE 
PRESIDENT JADRANKA KOSAR AND CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHTS 
PRESIDENT ANTE DJAPIC SAID THEY OBJECTED TO WHAT SEEMED LIKE 
AN EQUALIZATION OF GUILT. 
 
    COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU) ANY MESIC TRIP, OWING TO THE PRESIDENT\'S LIMITED 
CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS, IS GOING TO BE SHORT ON SUBSTANCE -- 
AND THIS ONE WAS NO EXCEPTION.  MESIC AND MAROVIC SHOWED SOME 
DEGREE OF POLITICAL COURAGE IN EXCHANGING APOLOGIES, AND THIS 
VISIT WILL DO MUCH TO PUSH BILATERAL RELATIONS EVEN FURTHER 
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  VIDIS WAS MORE CONFIDENT THAN HE HAS 
BEEN IN SOME WHILE ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR PROGRESS ON A 
NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES, INCLUDING BORDERS.  AND THE 
BEST THING ABOUT THIS VISIT, HE QUIPPED, WAS THAT IT PUSHED 
ZAGREB\'S PROBLEMS WITH SLOVENIA OFF THE FRONT PAGES.

REF: ZAGREB 1364 
 
Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The Croatian government has deferred plans to deploy 
a small military contingent to Iraq.  Since the government 
and parliament are expected to dissolve in advance of 
parliamentary elections predicted for late November, it is 
now unlikely that an Iraq deployment will take place before 
2004.  Citing unfavorable public opinion and wishing to avoid 
the deployment becoming an election issue, Foreign Minister 
Picula told the Ambassador on September 17 that the 
Government would not forward a deployment proposal to the 
Croatian parliament for ratification.  End Summary. 
 
In June, Croatia Decides to Deploy to Iraq... 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) On June 12, the Croatian Government made a formal 
\"determination\" that it intended to deploy troops to Iraq 
(ref).  We took this decision as it was intended: a display 
of political will in advance of technical discussions to 
gather details needed for final parliamentary approval of 
deployment.  Following the June 12 decision, military - to - 
military technical talks were authorized and Croatia began to 
plan seriously for deployment.  A Croatian Liaison Officer 
was deployed to U.S. Central Command on September 3 and 
tentative plans to deploy a small contingent of special 
operations forces to Iraq under U.S. command began to take 
shape.  Recognizing the political sensitivity of taking an 
unpopular decision in an election year, FM Picula asked the 
Ambassador at an August 27 lunch for our help in convincing 
potential opponents in the parliament to support a measure 
when it came to vote. 
 
But As Elections Approach, Political Leaders Get Cold Feet 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
3.  (C) Despite private statements of support from key 
political leaders, public opinion against deployment remains 
strong.  Late on September 15, we were informed that 
President Mesic had convened a meeting earlier that day at 
which he declared his opposition to deploying troops to Iraq. 
 We understand that PM Racan, FM Picula DefMin Antunovic and 
Parliament Speaker Tomcic were present at the meeting.  While 
Antunovic reportedly declared that the troops were ready and 
could carry out the mission, Racan\'s focus was on elections 
and the likely political cost of deployment to coalition 
parties. 
 
FonMin Picula Delivers the Bad News 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) On September 17, Foreign Minister Picula called in 
the Ambassador and informed him that \"in view of recent 
developments, both domestically and on the ground in Iraq, 
the Government has decided to postpone the decision on 
sending troops to Iraq.\"  Picula explained that the GoC 
sought to keep the Iraq deployment issue from becoming an 
issue in the upcoming election and questioned whether, in the 
current environment, a decision to deploy would garner the 
two-thirds majority in parliament required by Croatia\'s 
Constitution to deploy forces abroad.  Picula was careful to 
make a clear distinction between Croatia\'s continuing 
commitment to the anti-terrorist coalition and its hesitance 
on Iraq. 
 
Ambassador Pushes Back 
---------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The Ambassador said that the decision to delay was 
\"very disappointing\" and that it went back on the June 12 GoC 
political commitment to deploy.  The decision would not be 
welcome in Washington and would certainly have an effect on 
the bilateral relationship.  He rejected Picula\'s assertion 
that the parliament would not have approved a GoC decision to 
deploy, since in the course of our lobbying efforts we had 
assurances that if PM Racan\'s SDP (of which Picula is a 
member) backed the proposal, it would have more than enough 
support to pass.  The Ambassador made it clear that he 
understood the GoC was bowing to pressure from Mesic and that 
he was dismayed by its inability to show leadership on this 
issue.  He said the decision to back out of the decision to 
deploy was an \"embarrassment\" to the Croatian Armed Forces 
who were clearly ready to deploy.  Picula shrugged, saying 
that \"events in Iraq and Croatian elections are on a 
 
collision course.\"  The GoC decision to defer debate on 
deployment became public on September 18. 
 
Little Chance to Review Deployment before 2004 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.  (C)  Croatia\'s government and parliament are expected to 
dissolve in mid-October in advance of elections predicted for 
the end of November.  Although Picula claimed the decision to 
deploy to Iraq is only being \"delayed,\" it is unlikely that 
it could be revisited by the government and parliament before 
early 2004.

SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER PICULA SEEKS USG COMMMENT ON 
ARTICLE 98 OPTION 
 
REF: ZAGREB 1887 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF JUSTIN FRIEDMAN, REASONS 1.5 (B) & (D) 

1. (C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST: THE AMBASSADOR MET 
ONE-ON-ONE WITH FOREIGN MINISTER PICULA ON SEPTEMBER 17 TO 
DISCUSS KEY BILATERAL ISSUES IN ADVANCE OF HIS AND PRESIDENT 
MESIC\'S TRIP TO NEW YORK FOR THE UNGA (IRAQ TROOP 
CONTRIBUTION COVERED SEPTEL).  ASKED BY THE AMBASSADOR ABOUT 
THE STATUS OF A GOC PROPOSAL FOR AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT, AS 
WAS PROMISED TO US IN JUNE (REFTEL), PICULA SAID AN ARTICLE 
98 AGREEMENT WOULD BE DIFFICULT IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE. 
CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS GOC DISCUSSIONS, HE OFFERED TO 
NEGOTIATE AN AGREEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF A SOME FORM OF 
MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT.  NOTE: PICULA RAISED THIS 
OPTION WITH AMBASSADOR LINO IN JUNE, TO WHICH LINO RESPONDED 
THAT DESPITE THE WEAKNESSES INHERENT IN THIS OPTION, THE USG 
WOULD CONSIDER A GOC PROPOSAL.  PICULA HANDED THE AMBASSADOR 
A NON-PAPER (TEXT PARA 2) STATING THE GOC\'S CURRENT POSITION 
AND INVITED A U.S. RESPONSE.  POST REQUESTS WASHINGTON 
RESPONSE TO THE APPROACH SUGGESTED BY MINISTER PICULA.  END 
SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. 
 
2. (SBU) BEGIN GOC ARTICLE 98 POINTS (NOTE INTERNAL 
NUMBERING): 
 
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
 
TALKING POINTS 
 
FOR A MEETING BETWEEN CROATIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
TONINO PICULA AND THE US AMBASSADOR RALPH FRANK (ARTICLE 98 
AGREEMENT) 

1.  STARTING FROM THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND THE EU ON THE LEGAL NATURE AND PERMISSIBILITY OF 
SPECIAL AGREEMENTS ON NON-EXTRADITION TO THE ICC, AS WELL AS 
THE CROATIAN INTERNAL POLITICAL RELATIONS RELATED TO THE FACT 
THAT CROATIA CURRENTLY HAS AND WILL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO 
COOPERATE WITH THE ICTY, WE NEED TO STATE THAT THE 
MANEUVERING SPACE IS RATHER LIMITED. 
 
2. DURING THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS WITH THE US 
REPRESENTATIVES HELD IN JUNE 
2003 IT WAS STATED THAT THE ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT (AS 
PROPOSED) IS HARDLY ACCEPTABLE FOR CROATIAN SIDE, ESPECIALLY 
IN LIGHT OF THE CLEAR STAND OF CROATIAN PUBLIC OPINION. 
 
* ADDITIONALLY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR CONSTITUTION SUCH AN 
AGREEMENT SHOULD BE RATIFIED IN THE PARLIAMENT, WHICH COULD 
POSE AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM. 
 
3.  THE CROATIAN SIDE SUGGESTED THAT THE PROBLEM CAN BE 
SOLVED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A WIDER AGREEMENT ON 
EXTRADITION AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE (OR JUST THE EXTRADITION 
AGREEMENT). 
 
4.  THE ELEMENTS OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT COULD BE AS FOLLOWS: 
 
A)    INSTEAD OF CONCLUDING A SPECIAL AGREEMENT ON 
NON-EXTRADITION TO THE ICC, A SUITABLE PROVISION COULD BE 
INCLUDED IN THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN CROATIA AND THE US ON 
EXTRADITION AND MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE (ALTERNATIVELY IN 
EXTRADITION AGREEMENT OR TWO SEPARATE AGREEMENTS CAN BE 
    CONCLUDED). SUCH AN AGREEMENT DOES NOT EXIST UP TO DATE AND 
THE AGREEMENT CONCLUDED BETWEEN THE US AND THE KINGDOM OF 
SERBIA, TAKEN BY SUCCESSION OVER BY CROATIA, IS CURRENTLY 
IMPLEMENTED. 
 
B)    IN THE AGREEMENT, WHICH BY ITS NATURE SHOULD BE 
DETAILED AND IT SHOULD ENCOMPASS DIFFERENT FORMS OF LEGAL 
ASSISTANCE, THERE WOULD BE A PROVISION THAT WOULD NOT BE 
EXPLICITLY REFERRING TO THE ROME STATUTE. INSTEAD, IT WOULD 
BE A PROVISION THAT WOULD GENERALLY DEAL WITH MUTUAL 
EXTRADITION ISSUES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE 
&AUT DEDERE, AUT JUDICARE8 (TO PROSECUTE OR TO EXTRADITE).

SUBJECT: CROATIA\'S THIRD TELEVISION CHANNEL PRIVATIZED 
 
 
1.  Summary:  At its September 16 session, the 
Croatian Radio and Television Council selected the 
German-Croatian group, \"HRTL,\" for a 10-year 
concession for national television broadcasting in 
Croatia, thus privatizing Croatian Radio and 
Television\'s (HRT) third TV channel.  The 
privatization had attracted interest not only within 
Croatia, but also from major European broadcasters. 
After the decision was announced, Croatian media 
circles quickly began to speculate that the end result 
will be too much German media influence in Croatia. 
End summary. 
 
2.  In December 2002, the Croatian Government 
announced a public tender process to lease the third 
HRT channel.  The privatization attracted interest not 
only within Croatia, but also from major European 
broadcasters, and seven companies filed bids with the 
state Radio and Television Council.  The winner, HRTL, 
consists of the German RTL television company and a 
group of Croatian companies, including \"Agrokor,\" 
\"Podravka,\" \"Atlantic Group,\" \"HVB/Splitska Banka,\" 
and \"Pinta TV3.\"  Overall, RTL has 23 television and 
22 radio stations in eight European countries. 
HRTL prevailed over, among others, the \"Rovita\" 
company, whose backer was British media magnate Rupert 
Murdoch. 
 
3.  HRTL has announced that it will start broadcasting 
primarily entertainment programs, with a heavy dose of 
locally-produced shows, within the next six months. 
Given the money and talent behind HRTL, there is no 
doubt that it will provide state-owned HRT with strong 
competition, and it is generally hoped that the new 
commercial channel will raise the standards of 
Croatian journalism and of Croatian programming.  HRT 
will continue to broadcast on two nationwide channels, 
HRT1 and HRT2. 
 
4.  HRTL will have to pay the equivalent of $50,000 
for the annual broadcasting license, as well as large 
amounts of money to use the distribution system and 
satellite connections built years ago by HRT.  Only 
large international corporations had the resources to 
make an investment of this size, and, in fact, HRTL 
has already announced it will invest approximately $30 
million in the first year.  (Note: Foreign companies, 
however, could not apply without support of their 
domestic partners, since Croatian law prohibits 100 
percent foreign ownership of a national TV channel.) 
Before the decision was announced, there had been 
speculation among media watchers that any losing 
bidders would appeal the Radio and Television 
Council\'s decision, but as things stand now, there are 
no signs that they will do so. 
 
5. The Mission of the Organisation for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to Croatia issued a 
statement on September 17 stating that it hoped that 
the decision to allocate the frequency of the third 
national television channel to a private bidder would 
promote the private broadcasting sector in Croatia and 
introduce healthy competition to the national 
television scene.  Mission head Ambassador Peter 
Semneby said in the statement that \"... the bidding 
procedure ... appeared to be transparent\", and that, 
\"This will hopefully contribute to the pluralism of 
the television market in Croatia and benefit the 
Croatian public through a wider variety of views in 
television news programming.  We are satisfied with 
the openness of the selection procedure, regardless of 
who was eventually awarded the tender.\" 
 
6.  Comment:  While there is general satisfaction with 
the professional quality of RTL, Croatian media 
observers have already started commenting that, with 
this decision, Croatian media have, de facto, been 
turned over to German ownership.  Considering the fact 
that the German company \"WAZ\"--a co-owner of the 
German mega-group \"Bertelsmann\"--owns 50 percent of 
strategic shares in the largest Croatian newspaper and 
magazine publisher \"Europa Press Holding\" (EPH), some 
Croatian voices in the media are speculating that 
German strategic financial, media and political 
interests have prevailed in Croatia.  Unfortunately, 
the HRTL-run channel will not be operational for the 
parliamentary elections expected for November 23.  The 
private channel could have provided broader media 
access for all political parties, which was an issue 
 
for the last elections in 2000.

SUBJECT: WHO\'S WHO IN CROATIAN POLITICS - AN ELECTION PRIMER 
 
Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) Croatia\'s next parliamentary elections are expected 
to take place on November 23.  For the uninitiated, the 
number of political parties, alliances and personalities 
might seem overwhelming.  At this stage in Croatia\'s 
democratic development, political parties are beginning to 
stake out distinct territory on the policy spectrum, but most 
voters still make their choices either by loyalty to a \"brand 
name\" or by identifying with the personalities at the top of 
a party\'s electoral list. 
 
2.  (C) This telegram is intended as a reference tool.  It 
provides a thumbnail sketch of some of the leading Croatian 
politicians expected to play a role in this parliamentary 
election.  The politicians are listed alphabetically in one 
of two groups -- ruling coalition and opposition parties. 
After results of the final USAID-sponsored IRI poll are 
released (on October 9), we will offer a primer on Croatia\'s 
political parties and their basic platforms, along with their 
ratings at the beginning of the sprint to the November 23 
election.  When the parliament is dissolved and elections 
finally called (expected in mid-October), we will offer a 
primer on the rules of the election game in Croatia. 
 
======================== 
Ruling Coalition Figures 
======================== 
 
3.  (C) Zeljka Antunovic (Age 48, Social Democratic Party - 
SDP)  As deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Vice 
President of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Antunovic is 
Croatia\'s undisputed leading woman politician.  Many were 
skeptical when she was appointed to be Croatia\'s first female 
Defense Minister in June 2002, but steady success on tough 
management issues like defense downsizing have turned heads. 
A pragmatic, engaging personality, she is expected to be a 
standard-bearer for the SDP as the campaign heats up.  Unlike 
Racan, Antunovic has no skeletons in her closet from the 
Communist League of Croatia, which gives SDP\'s centrist 
claims more credibility. 
 
4.  (C) Ivo Banac (Age 56, Liberal Party - LS) Well-liked by 
the few in Croatia who know him and mistrusted by the vast 
majority who do not, this outsider was a full-time professor 
at Yale before he won the presidency of the Liberal Party 
early in 2003.  His blunt approach has alienated some of the 
LS faithful, but his appreciation of U.S. policy is sometimes 
music to our ears.  We understand Banac is keeping his chair 
at Yale in reserve if (or when) things go poorly for LS at 
elections. 
 
5.  (C) Milan Bandic (Age 48, SDP)  An ambitious workaholic 
known in every corner in the capital, Bandic is a modern 
politician in the American style; no babies go unkissed an no 
ribbons are uncut without Bandic posing for the newspapers. 
He is in the middle of a political comeback from a drunk 
driving incident in early 2002, after which he had to step 
down from the Mayor\'s chair.  His popularity extends only as 
far as the Zagreb city limits, where hizzoner is expected to 
take back the mayor\'s chair when it comes open next.  Outside 
of Zagreb, Bandic could be a liability to the SDP and Racan 
may keep this one-time rival at arm\'s length. 
 
6.  (C) Radimir Cacic (Age 54, Croatian Peoples\' Party -HNS) 
Rough-hewn and blunt-spoken, Cacic was rated as the \"most 
efficient\" Minister in the current government.  Cacic is 
given credit for the government\'s progress in building 
highways and housing.  A successful businessman both in and 
out of government, Cacic is viewed with suspicion by some 
observers for potential conflict of interest.  He is 
notorious for his careless statements; even his closest party 
colleagues say that he should just work, and not speak at 
all. 
 
7.  (C) Goran Granic (Age 53, Libra) The workhorse of the 
Racan government and Deputy Prime Minister for most of its 
term in office, Granic has become a liability for the 
coalition.  Granic\'s portfolio includes ICTY, returnee issues 
and intelligence oversight.  The longer he went on, the more 
the policy constraints imposed by the international community 
began to chafe.  While he recognizes how important it is for 
Croatia\'s future to cooperate with ICTY, he bristles at any 
negative characterization of the goals of Croatia\'s \"homeland 
war.\"  In the past year, he became bitter, and took ICTY 
criticism of GoC shortcomings personally.  He alienated 
potential allies of GoC policy on more than one occasion when 
lashing out at perceived attackers. 
 
8.  (C) Ivan Jakovcic (Age 48, Istrian Democratic Union - 
IDS)  The Lord of Istria, Croatia\'s most-developed western 
region, Jakovcic cares little for politics in Zagreb. 
Jakovcic rules the IDS with an iron hand, while at the same 
time attempts to present the impression of an urbane, modern 
leader.  Jakovcic\'s political goals are simple: make the best 
 
political deal he can with Zagreb to ensure the most 
development and independence for Istria.  Too long in power, 
the IDS and Jakovcic personally are beset by scandals, one of 
which involves Jakovcic\'s purchase of an entire historic 
village. 
 
9.  (C) Damir Kajin (Age 41, IDS) The emissary of the Istrian 
party in Zagreb, Kajin is a loyal lieutenant of Jakovcic but 
regularly polls higher than his boss both in Istria and on 
the national level.  Kajin is an eloquent and frequent 
proponent of progressive policy choices from the floor of the 
parliament and often comes under fire from the nationalist 
right-wing.  An able scrapper, Kajin usually holds his own. 
Unlike Jakovcic, Kajin is widely viewed as a leader of high 
principles and integrity. 
 
10.  (C) Slavko Linic (Age 54, SDP)  This former long-time 
Mayor of Rijeka has played a key role in restructuring the 
Croatian economy as Racan\'s Deputy Prime Minister responsible 
for all things economic.  While basic economic indicators in 
Croatia are turning up, Linic is tainted with suspicion for 
all of the GoC\'s recent false starts on privatization.  Linic 
was much more popular while he was a successful mayor of an 
\"opposition\" city that defied the Tudjman government.  His 
national-level role as Croatia\'s official belt-tightener and 
his tough portfolio have hurt Linic\'s ratings.  The fact that 
he is intolerant of the media and at times even hostile to 
reporters doesn\'t help either. 
 
11.  (C) Stipe Mesic (Age 69, HNS?).  As President of 
Croatia, Mesic is supposed to remain above the political 
fray, but the nearer elections approach, the more likely it 
is that his HNS colors will show through.  With a year to go 
in his five-year term, Mesic remains popular and is trusted 
by the people and has become the conscience of Croatian 
politics. Mesic speaks in plain words and easily cuts to the 
heart of the matter.  His past affinity for the non-aligned 
movement sometimes leads him to make choices at odds with 
U.S. policy goals; his early, unmeasured statements against 
U.S. action in Iraq and his recent trip to Libya are 
examples.  These conflict with his positive statements 
encouraging refugee return, regional fence mending and 
cooperation with ICTY. 
 
12.  (C) Tonino Picula (Age 42, SDP).  Croatia\'s foreign 
minister draws most of his political influence from his 
absolute loyalty to his party boss, PM Racan.  At the same 
time, Racan\'s patronage is an obstacle for him to become a 
full-fledged leader.  Just before Picula\'s appointment almost 
four years ago, one of the winning coalition leaders told the 
Embassy that \"Picula will be the foreign minister, but Racan 
will run foreign affairs.\"  Four years later, analysts argue 
this is still the case.  However, Croatian foreign policy 
achievements early on necessarily turned this former party 
secretary to a fairly popular national figure.  Picula\'s 
 
SIPDIS 
youthful approach and hardworking nature suggest he has a 
long political future. 
 
13.  (C) Vesna Pusic (Age 50, HNS).  A modern, sophisticated, 
charismatic leader, this former Georgetown professor has 
turned her one-time marginal Croatian People\'s Party into a 
serious player.  Her deep-seated liberal views win her few 
admirers outside the intellectual elite, but she has helped 
keep the Racan coalition going.  In practice, Pusic has 
proven herself to be a pragmatic politician ready to get 
things done.  Some see her as the next FM if an SDP-led 
coalition returns to power after the next election. 
 
14.  (C) Ivica Racan (Age 59, SDP).  PM Racan is a man of 
patience and tactic, rather than one of action.  While these 
traits helped him survive the Tudjman regime as he 
transformed Croatia\'s League of Communists into the SDP, it 
has been maddening for those who hoped for decisive 
leadership and has meant missed opportunities for Croatia. 
While his SDP may now be a modern, left-of-center party, 
Racan (its president) still has reflexes from its communist 
past.  When he cut a back-room deal with his Slovenian 
counterpart on a contentious maritime border issue, he was 
shocked to learn that he could not muscle it through even his 
own party, let alone the rest of the parliament.  He is 
excessively risk-averse, and his decision to back away first 
from the Vilnius-10 declaration and later from a decision to 
deploy Croatian troops to Iraq hurt Croatia\'s relations with 
the U.S. 
 
15.  (C) Jozo Rados (Age 47, Libra) Genial and intelligent, 
Rados\'s preference to remain out of the day-to-day political 
dialogue will likely bring about his doom as a leader in 
Croatia.  He showed real political courage when he led a 
group of MP\'s away from Budisa\'s HSLS to save the Racan 
government, but his ineptitude as a manager during his 
15-month stint as Minister of Defense meant a slow start on 
defense reform. 
 
16.  (C) Zlatko Tomcic (Age 58, Croatian Peasant\'s Party - 
 
HSS)  Authoritarian and politically vain, Tomcic is the 
undisputed leader of the Croatian Peasant Party; he expects - 
and rewards - total obedience.  Comfortably positioned in a 
political can\'t-lose position as Croatia\'s third strongest 
party (and therefore kingmaker), the HSS has a stable, mainly 
rural constituency.  Tomcic likes to give the impression that 
as Speaker of Croatia\'s Parliament he is above the political 
rough-and-tumble, but he is really a natural at cutting 
back-room deals and drives a notoriously hard bargain with 
Racan.  Because of his constituency, the Catholic Church has 
strong influence over Tomcic. 
 
================== 
Opposition Parties 
================== 
 
17.  (C) Drazen Budisa (Age 55, Croatian Social Liberal Party 
- HSLS) Imperious, unpredictable and politically 
self-destructive, Budisa took his party from the 
second-largest in Croatia to the brink of political 
irrelevance in less than two years.  An egotistic tantrum 
brought down the first Racan government and split his party. 
A charismatic public speaker still viewed as a tragic hero 
from his role in the \"Croatian Spring,\" he should never be 
counted all the way out as a political force. 
 
18.  (C) Anto Djapic (Age 45, Croatian Party of Rights, HSP) 
President of the most radical nationalist party in Croatian 
Parliament, Djapic has been an apologist and even an open 
admirer of Croatia\'s World War II-era fascist regime.  Under 
pressure from the HDZ (which  might need the HSP to form a 
coalition government), Djapic renounced the Ustashe in 
September 2003.  Some observers speculate that Djapic has 
been handsomely compensated by the HDZ for making them look 
reasonable by comparison. 
 
19.  (C) Mate Granic (Age 56, Democratic Center - DC) 
Minister of Foreign Affairs for most of the Tudjman regime, 
Granic broke away from the HDZ to form \"Democratic Center\" in 
early 2000.  Although the DC never got off the ground as a 
conservative alternative to the HDZ, Granic often polls as 
Croatia\'s most popular politician.  His positive polling is a 
result of good name recognition and his inability to offend 
anyone.  His younger brother is Deputy PM Goran Granic, who 
reportedly once remarked that \"whenever there is anything 
important to decide, Mate is usually in the bathroom.\" 
 
20.  (C) Jadranka Kosor (Age 50, HDZ)  Adding a human, even 
glamorous, face to the traditionally hard-line HDZ, Kosor\'s 
approach to the public is shaped by her status as a single 
mother caring for an elderly, infirm parent.  While she may 
have been added to the HDZ presidency to give it gender 
balance, she is now an important political player in her own 
right. 
 
21.  (C) Ivic Pasalic (Age 44, Croatian Blok - HB) Pasalic 
was purged from the HDZ after nearly defeating Sanader in a 
bruising race for the party presidency.  As the \"eminence 
grise\" for much of the Tudjman regime, Pasalic is widely 
believed to have been personally responsible for some of the 
worst HDZ abuses of power both during and after the war.  But 
nothing has stuck to Pasalic, and although he is on the USG\'s 
\"obstructing Dayton\" blacklist, he has not been indicted in 
Croatia. 
 
22.  (C) Ivo Sanader (Age 50, Croatian Democratic Union - 
HDZ)  A polished, eloquent salesman, in the three years since 
he took over Tudjman\'s HDZ, Sanader eliminated his internal 
political opposition using both fair means and foul.  Now he 
is working overtime to present the HDZ as just another 
conservative European party.  Sanader wears his ambition on 
his sleeve (right next to his Rolex) and will make any deal 
that will get his HDZ into government.  He and a few other 
HDZ leaders represent the respectable veneer on the 
largely-unreformed HDZ. 
 
23.  (C) Vladimir Seks (Age 60, HDZ) The whip of the HDZ 
parliamentary caucus, Seks uses his considerable procedural 
expertise to keep the Racan government as uncomfortable as 
possible.  His reputation is still tainted with the worst 
forms of Tudjman-era cronyism, but he has quit drinking and 
is working hard to reform his public image.  A new scandal 
about coercing \"contributions\" to the party from business 
leaders in the old days and his continued low ratings in 
polls suggest that the Croatian public still takes him for 
the Tudjman-era dirty dealer that he always was. 
 
24.  (C) Miroslav Tudjman (Age 58, Croatian True Revival - 
HIP)  Tudjman Junior\'s greatest political assets are his name 
recognition and his uncanny physical resemblance to his 
father.  The head of one of Croatia\'s often-abused 
intelligence services during the HDZ regime, some observers 
believe he has enough \"goods\" on coalition leaders to keep 
them from going after him.  More likely is that they do not 
see this uncharismatic academic as a threat.

Summary 
------------ 
 
1. (U) On October 3, the Ambassador paid an initial courtesy 
call on Sevko Omerbasic, Mufti of Zagreb and Croatia. 
Omerbasic, an educator and known moderate, has been quoted in 
the press as being critical of U.S. actions in Iraq.  When 
asked if there had been any efforts to promote extremism in 
Croatia, Omerbasic emphatically said \"no,\" and assured us 
that extremist views are unlikely to be found among the small 
and moderate Muslim population of Croatia.  In a wide-ranging 
meeting, Omerbasic struck a balanced and progressive tone, 
thanked the U.S. Mission for a recent donation to a Muslim 
community, and indicated a desire for further close contact 
with the Embassy.  End Summary. 
 
A Face of Progressive Islam 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) On October 3 the Ambassador paid an introductory call 
on Sevko Omerbasic, Mufti of Zagreb and Croatia.  Ahmed 
Ikanovic, Secretary of the Islamic Community in Croatia, and 
Mirsad Srebrnikovic, President of the Islamic Center, joined 
in what was a productive and informative meeting.  Omerbasic 
estimated the size of the Islamic community of Croatia to be 
well over the official figure of 70,000 and nearly double its 
pre-war size.  He described the Community\'s successes in 
education, and detailed their plans to develop a university 
and increase social services, such as establishing a 
pre-school and home for retirees. 
 
3. (U) Omerbasic spoke of the September 11 attack on the 
United States and the tremendous damage it caused to the 
reputation of Islam.  He noted that there were \"irrational\" 
responses to the attack, including some from religious 
leaders in the United States, but assured us that he believed 
religious leaders had a responsibility to promote peace, 
reconciliation, and tolerance. 
 
4. (SBU) Omerbasic said he was energetically against Croatia 
sending troops to Iraq out of fear of a backlash against 
Muslims in Croatia from the majority Roman Catholic 
population should a Croatian soldier be wounded or killed. 
He urged us to seek alliances with Arab nations -- such as 
Egypt -- who could supply Arab troops who would then take the 
lead in rebuilding of Iraq.  He expressed concern that every 
additional U.S. soldier killed in Iraq will serve only to 
worsen American views of Islam and the Arab world.  However, 
he confided to us that on Saddam personally, he would have 
done the same as the U.S. and Great Britain.  He said it was 
not lost on him or others that only after Saddam\'s fall did 
he proclaim himself a religious person.  The Ambassador noted 
Croatia\'s desire to enter Euro-Atlantic alliances and the 
European Union, and spoke of the responsibility of all 
democratic nations to play a role in the defense of democracy 
and the fight against terrorism.  The Mufti stated further 
that he supported the Government\'s decision to send police to 
Afghanistan -- noting that the Taliban had little to do with 
Islam. 
 
5. (U) In September, on one of his first trips outside 
Zagreb, the Ambassador donated $13,000, including books, 
computers, a photocopy machine, and sporting equipment to the 
primary school and Muslim Community Center in the village of 
Maljevac.  South of Zagreb in a hard-hit war-affected area, 
Maljevac is one of a series of small impoverished villages 
with a large Muslim population along the border with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Omerbasic said he visited the village 
just after the Ambassador, and saw for himself the donations 
and the effect they were having on the community.  He praised 
the donation as a symbol of the United States as a nation 
based on justice and the rule of law.  He portrayed Islam as 
a positive and progressive force, and by so doing aligned 
himself as a democrat in support of the same principles as 
the United States. 
 
Comment 
------------- 
 
6. (SBU) While he seemed at times reluctant to venture too 
deeply into domestic politics -- saying the Government did 
not seek his views -- he nonetheless felt comfortable enough 
to discuss a broad range of issues, from the Middle East to 
the upcoming elections.  He was extremely positive about the 
current government, calling its policy toward religious 
minorities \"revolutionary\" -- and expressed hope that there 
would be \"continuity\" in the Government beyond elections 
expected this fall.  We found the discussion fruitful, and 
 
will seek additional opportunities for the larger Embassy 
community to engage Omerbasic and his staff on issues of 
mutual concern.

 SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Since its declarations this spring and June 12 
initiative aimed at providing subsidized housing to refugees 
who enjoyed \"tenancy rights\" under the old Yugoslav system, 
the GOC has made little progress on key return-related 
issues.  The number of refugees returning to Croatia lags 
behind those in recent years.  Representatives from key IC 
organizations, including UNHCR, OSCE, and the European 
Commission, agree that the government,s performance on a 
number of issues, including repossession of property, 
evictions, and rental compensation, remains poor.  We will 
need to work with others in the IC to keep the pressure on 
the government to produce results.  There is some debate, 
however, over how hard to press -- particularly right now. 
This is a politically sensitive time for the Croatian 
government, with elections expected in November.  End 
Summary. 
 
GOC Makes Promises On Return Issues( 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Earlier this spring and prior to its submission of its 
application for EU membership, the GOC made a series of 
promises to resolve key issues related to refugee returns. 
More specifically, the GOC pledged to resolve by year-end the 
almost 7,000 cases involving property repossession to pay 
rental compensation to owners -- primarily Serbs -- who were 
not able to occupy their homes, to evict mostly Croat double 
and illegal occupants (those who were illegally occupying 
homes at the same time they owned property in one of the 
former Yugoslav republics, or who simply were not entitled to 
housing care from the state), and to increase significantly 
the pace of reconstruction of property for Serb owners.  The 
GOC vowed that, by taking these actions, most of the issues 
affecting returns would be resolved by the end of this year. 
The government expected that about two years would be needed 
to complete the property reconstruction process. 
 
3. (C) In June, after considerable pressure from the 
international community and growing complaints about the lack 
of GOC progress on returns, the government promised to take a 
comprehensive approach to refugee returns by adopting 
legislation providing housing assistance to refugees who 
wanted to return to Croatia (REF A).  This policy covered 
those mostly Serb owners who were former occupancy/tenancy 
rights holders under the old Yugoslav system.  The program 
was to offer the holders the option of renting or buying a 
home at subsidized prices.  From the GOC perspective, 
adopting such legislation was the final piece of the puzzle 
that would resolve the refugee issue altogether.  GOC leaders 
vowed to provide the IC with a detailed implementation plan 
for the housing program within 30 days after its 
announcement.  \"Housing is no longer an obstacle for refugees 
seeking to return to Croatia,8 Prime Minister Racan said 
after he invited all Serb refugees to return to Croatia. 
However, no such plan has been offered to date. 
 
(While the IC sets Benchmarks 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Meanwhile, the international community -- including 
OSCE and EC -- has sought to keep the pressure on the GOC. 
In its March report, the European Commission set specific 
benchmarks that the GOC must meet, some by the end of the 
year, others by March 2004 (REF B).  The report stipulated 
that the GOC must show concrete progress on repossession, 
reconstruction, and compensation for lost occupancy/tenancy 
rights.  It also called on the GOC to resolve the issue of 
repossession by the end of the year.  That said, while 
remaining firm that Croatia must honor its commitments, 
Jacques Wunenburger, head of Zagreb\'s EC mission, conceded to 
the Ambassador on September 30 that he doubted the GOC\'s 
record on refugee returns would hold up Croatia\'s bid for EU 
membership -- in this respect, the government\'s cooperation 
with the war crimes tribunal loomed much larger. 
 
5. (C) The OSCE noted in its July Status Report on Croatia 
that much progress was still needed on repossession, 
evictions and housing reconstruction.  It noted that the pace 
of returns had slowed down.  The report also highlighted 
interviews with Serb refugees who cited housing problems as 
well as legal, administrative, and psychological barriers as 
key obstacles to their return and reintegration into Croatian 
society.  OSCE officials noted that the Croatian government 
would likely receive a more critical report during its 
evaluation in the fall if it did not make significant 
 
progress on the key issues of concern raised by the OCSE. 
 
 
6. (C) In the July joint monthly report produced by UNHCR and 
the OSCE, UNHCR noted that the GOC has not created a 
favorable environment, particularly in the war-affected 
regions, for the return of refugees.  Many refugees continue 
to face \"discriminatory practices\" in terms of medical, 
social, and humanitarian assistance from the government 
leaving them in extremely vulnerable situations.  UNHCR 
called on the government to implement legislation immediately 
aimed at improving the overall conditions of refugees who 
have already returned and for those seeking to return. 
 
That was Then, This is Now 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (C) EC, OSCE and UNHCR officials have told us that the GOC 
has not made as much progress as expected on repossession, 
reconstruction, compensation, and implementing the new 
housing program.  They also note that meetings with GOC 
officials in recent weeks have not gone well.  The GOC 
appeared to be backtracking on its commitments and taking a 
more hostile attitude when sensitive issues related to the 
government,s performance were discussed. 
 
8. (C) The EC mission,s point person on returns, Alfons 
Peters, told us that while the government has made 
significant progress on reconstruction, it has not made much 
progress on the repossession of property, rental 
compensation, and implementing the new housing program.  The 
government would not meet its self-imposed year-end deadline 
for solving all of the property repossession cases (some 
2,000 cases would be left unresolved).  Peters believed that 
a major reason for the government,s problems was a lack of 
communication among the relevant ministries and a lack of 
expertise.  He told us that the EC mission would probably 
give the GOC the benefit of the doubt and accept a longer 
implementation period as long as the GOC could present an 
acceptable program of action to resolve the outstanding 
issues. 
 
9. (C) The Head of the Return and Reintegration unit at the 
OSCE mission, Axel Jaenicke, told us that the GOC,s 
performance over the past three months was dismal.  Almost 
5,000 repossession cases were unresolved, some 15,000 
applications for reconstruction assistance remain without a 
formal decision, and the government,s rental compensation 
plan has been a \"miserable failure.\"  Only a few hundred 
owners, out of an initial group of 4,000 claimants, have 
received some form of payment and those were not for the 
proper amounts.  The program lacks transparency, and its 
guidelines make it difficult to determine who is eligible to 
receive compensation and for what amount.  Even more 
discouraging are reports that GOC officials in different 
jurisdictions are encouraging Serb owners not to apply for 
compensation.  Jaenicke said that the OSCE was in the process 
of determining what message the mission would send about the 
GOC,s performance in two upcoming reports, including the 
Mission,s official status report due in November. 
 
10. (C) UNHCR Head Bajulaiye told us that he was very 
disappointed with the GOC\'s recent progress.  He described a 
recent meeting that he and his EC and OSCE counterparts had 
with Reconstruction Minister Cacic in which Cacic himself 
gave a somber assessment of the GOC,s performance on 
return-related issues.  Cacic stated that the government 
would not meet its self-imposed deadlines and those set by 
the IC, particularly in resolving all of the property 
repossession cases.  Cacic further admitted that little 
progress had been made in implementing the new housing 
program announced on June 12, and that the GOC has failed to 
provide the IC with a detailed implementation plan as 
promised by July. 
 
11. (C) Bajulaiye left the meeting feeling that not much had 
been accomplished except more GOC promises, which will not be 
fulfilled.  He cited an incident last month in which ODPR 
Head Pejkovic threatened to raise complaints at UNHCR 
headquarters against his UNHCR counterparts from BiH and 
Serbia and Montenegro when they voiced concerns about the 
GOC,s commitment to the returns process.  He also cited the 
hostile responses of senior GOC officials to the most recent 
Human Right Watch Report, which was highly critical of the 
GOC,s performance on refugee and minority issues, as another 
counterproductive action by the GOC.  Bajulaiye vowed not to 
sugar coat any UNHCR reports on the GOC\'s progress in coming 
months. 
 
GOC Appealing for More Time 
--------------------------- 
 
12. (C) When we met with Pejkovic last week to get the GOC,s 
perspective, we found him in a much more somber mood than 
usual.  His office has been under increased pressure from the 
 
government as refugee-related questions were among the most 
important ones the GOC has to respond to as the GOC prepared 
answers to the EU questionnaire.  In recent weeks, his staff 
has had to focus solely on preparing a response to the EU 
questions, which had forced him to place other 
returns-related issues on the back burner.  He argued that 
repossession, evictions, and compensations were extremely 
complex issues and required a functioning judiciary system, 
which Croatia did not have at the moment.  He pleaded for 
more time.  There are some 19,000 claims for reconstruction 
and 4,600 repossession cases that must be resolved. 
 
13. (C) Pejkovic predicted that it would be more difficult to 
resolve property repossession in regions such as Knin, 
Benkovac, and Obrovac because of a substantial extremist 
presence.  Taking drastic actions would increase ethnic 
hostilities and lead to open conflicts between the local 
populations and returning refugees.  Pejkovic noted that the 
information campaign designed to inform refugee populations 
in BiH and Serbia and Montenegro about the GOC,s housing 
program will start at the end of the month.  The GOC had 
already included funding for the construction of 1,500 
apartments in next year,s budget.  He predicted that a total 
of about 5,000 apartments would be needed as he expected a 
similar number of applicants would qualify and want to 
participate in the program. 
 
While Returns Continue to Spiral Downward 
----------------------------------------- 
 
14. (C) The most recent UNHCR and GOC figures show that 
refugee returns continue to decline.  In the first seven 
months of this, some 5,860 refugees have returned to Croatia 
from BiH and Serbia and Montenegro.  This is compared to a 
total of 9,640 returns in 2002 and 10,572 returns in 2001 
based on ODPR figures.  UNHCR figures indicate that as of the 
end of July there were 6,400 returns to Croatia this year 
compared to a total of 11,000 returns all of last year.  With 
the returns season ending in August, UNHCR does not expect a 
spike in returns over the remaining three months of the year 
as the winter months approach.  UNHCR estimates that there 
may be up to 1,000 more returns by year-end but not more. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
15. (C) The Racan government has demonstrated again it is 
content to make declarations expressing its commitment to the 
returns process without following through on implementation 
-- a dichotomy that the government makes no effort to hide. 
Senior GOC officials have not publicly raised the housing 
program initiative since it was first announced in June, and 
there have been few if any evictions.  Despite specific 
deadlines, many GOC officials overseeing refugee returns took 
the entire month of August off for holidays and spent 
September working on the EU questionnaire instead of on 
return issues.  Pejkovic said that substantial progress will 
probably not be made until next year after a new government 
is formed. 
 
16.  (C) On refugee-related issues, Croatian government 
officials may be sensing fatigue on the part of their 
international critics.  We are taking steps to combat this 
perception and to keep the GOC focused.  While the upcoming 
parliamentary elections will make it difficult to engage 
senior leaders on the refugee problem, we intend to propose 
that returns be raised at the upcoming review of Croatia\'s 
NATO Annual National Program in Brussels.  Until a new 
Croatian government is seated, we will focus on building 
consensus for a consistent international community stance on 
refugee return issues.  We will also seek opportunities to 
engage at the local level to remind officials of our 
continued interest and expectation of results.  Once a new 
government is seated, engaging key officials early and often 
will be part of our effort.

SUBJECT: DEL PONTE BRIEFS DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON CROATIA\'S 
ICTY COOPERATION 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte briefed the 
diplomatic corps in Zagreb following her October 6 meetings 
with PM Racan and President Mesic.  Del Ponte was pleased 
with the GoC\'s new-found capacity to fulfill requests for 
assistance from the OTP.  As expected, she was harshly 
critical of GoC efforts to date to find and apprehend ICTY 
fugitive Ante Gotovina, and said she had given PM Racan 
specific information of individuals and \"services\" in Croatia 
which were supporting Gotovina\'s flight from justice.  Del 
Ponte commented that the GoC could arrest Gotovina in \"a 
matter of weeks\" if it made a concerted effort.  The 
Prosecutor credited international pressure, particularly from 
the EU, for the GoC\'s improved performance, and asked that 
the international community maintain that pressure to ensure 
Croatia\'s continued cooperation with the ICTY.  Del Ponte 
expressed confidence that Croatian prosecutors and special 
war crimes courts would be able to take over outstanding war 
crimes cases as called for the ICTY completion strategy. End 
Summary. 
 
Documents are Flowing 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a well-attended briefing for the diplomatic corps 
October 6, ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte stated that 
the GoC\'s performance in meeting requests for assistance 
(RFAs) -- access to documentary archives and access to 
individuals -- had improved markedly over the last few 
months.  She specifically said she would avoid the term 
\"satisfied\" as it had too many possible interpretations.  She 
said that RFAs that had been outstanding over 13 months were 
now being completed.  She stressed that her office would need 
to review the materials being delivered, but was confident 
that the quantity and quality represented significant 
improvement over the past. 
 
3. (C) Del Ponte credited pressure from the international 
community, particularly from the EU as it reviewed 
ratification of Croatia\'s SAA, as the critical impetus for 
the GoC\'s improved performance.  Commenting on questions over 
whether the ICTY could continue to provide this kind of clear 
benchmark for the GoC\'s performance in cooperating with the 
ICTY, del Ponte said that the requests for assistance are 
constantly being generated, but that she was more positive 
now that the GoC would not sit on new requests.  She said she 
hoped the GoC would continue to answer RFAs in a timely 
fashion. 
 
GoC still stalling on Gotovina 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Del Ponte said that two previous reports the GoC had 
provided her on September 18th and 25th on its efforts to 
arrest Gotovina (reports required under Rule 59 of the 
Tribunal) were \"absolutely unacceptable.\"  She said she had 
not reviewed a new report handed to her that day, but at 
first glance it appears to complement and add to the previous 
reports. 
 
5. (C) Del Ponte said she had provided PM Racan and Police 
Chief Ranko Ostojic with her assessment of why she continues 
to believe that ICTY indictee and fugitive Ante Gotovina is 
still in Croatia.  She noted that President Mesic had told 
her a year ago that he had seen Gotovina personally in Zagreb 
in the company of a police escort. 
 
6. (C) In her separate, private meeting with PM Racan, she 
said she had provided Racan with specific information on 
individuals and parts of institutions that continue to 
support Govovina\'s flight from justice.  Racan said he would 
work to ensure the information does not become 
\"contaminated,\" repeating the term to refer to the need to 
dismiss some authorities because of such \"contamination.\" 
 
7. (C) Speaking of the two meetings, she said that some 
information was known to her Croatian interlocutors, but some 
had surprised them.  She said that Racan had softened his 
line as a result, saying to her what he repeated at their 
press conference, that the GoC was ready to arrest Gotovina 
if he is in Croatia, and to assist other governments if he is 
abroad. 
 
8. (C) Commenting on local press reports, del Ponte said that 
the ICTY had not/not conducted any negotiations with Gotovina 
via Ivo Pukanic, editor in chief of the sensationalist weekly 
Nacional.  She let Thomas Osorio -- the ICTY Head of Office 
in Zagreb -- explain that Pukanic had approached Osorio with 
a message from Gotovina, to which the ICTY had responded that 
there would be no deals, the indictment against Gotovina 
E 
 
 
would not be withdrawn, and that the only place for Gotovina 
was in The Hague.  Del Ponte said President Mesic had 
indicated that Pukanic had approached him as well, and Mesic 
had responded with the message to Gotovina that it would be 
best if the fugitive general would voluntarily surrender 
himself.  Del Ponte said, without further elaboration, that 
the infamous photo on the cover of the June 10th issue of 
Nacional, showing Pukanic and Gotovina together, was 
evidently a forgery. 
 
9. (C) Del Ponte also criticized the GoC, stating that 
Gotovina was continuing to draw on his military pension, 
while his wife continued to receive her colonel\'s military 
salary without reporting for duty, but no effort had been 
made to track down to whom or where the money was being sent. 
 Del Ponte noted that she did not believe that these funds 
were sufficient to sustain the evidently luxurious lifestyle 
Gotovina was enjoying on the run, but the fact they were 
still flowing indicated a lack of effort on the part of the 
GoC since the prosecutor\'s office had highlighted these flows 
back in December 2001.  President Mesic promised to look into 
the matter. 
 
Importance of International Pressure 
------------------------------------ 
 
10. (C) When the Dutch ambassador asked her whether she 
wasn\'t putting too much emphasis on Gotovina in light of the 
improved cooperation on the documentation issue, del Ponte 
responded that it was clear to her that the recent progress 
was only happening because of international pressure.  Del 
Ponte said she believed Gotovina could be arrested in a few 
weeks, if GoC efforts continued as they were now.  The EU 
ambassador commented that ratification of Croatia\'s EU SAA 
depended on her report to the UNSC.  Del Ponte responded that 
she would keep her report strictly to the facts.  However, 
she believed personally that it would be better if Gotovina 
remained a condition of SAA ratification, as she was sure the 
GoC could arrest him if it wanted to. 
 
No Interest in New Indictments 
------------------------------ 
 
11. (C) Del Ponte said that none of her interlocutors had 
expressed any interest in new indictments being prepared by 
the ICTY.  She said the investigations were complete to open 
four new indictments, but declined to answer when these would 
be released. 
 
Local Capacity 
-------------- 
 
12. (C) Del Ponte commented that she had confidence in State 
Prosecutor Mladen Bajic and his office\'s ability to take over 
local prosecution of cases under the ICTY completion 
strategy.  She added that the successful prosecution of Norac 
had improved her confidence in the ability of Croatian courts 
to take on more war crimes cases. 
 
13. (C) Del Ponte said the pending law on war crimes which 
would designate special courts to try war crimes cases would 
hopefully prevent future travesties of justice as had 
occurred in the Lora case in Split.  She noted that when her 
team had complained in one meeting today that the draft war 
crimes law did not have adequate provision for the use of 
ICTY-generated evidence in Croatian court proceedings, 
Minister of Justice Anticevic-Marinovic had picked up her 
cell phone and called the drafters working on the legislation 
to order the necessary change.  (Note: the draft law passed 
first reading in the Sabor on October 1st, but had been taken 
off the fast track.  This could indicate the law will be back 
in for a final vote before the Sabor is dissolved on October 
14th in advance of the November 23rd elections.  End Note.)

     B. STATE 272470 
 
1.  On September 18, at a meeting with representatives of 
embassies of all eleven PSI states, Croatia\'s Foreign 
Ministry made an informal declaration of support for PSI 
principles, but asked questions about the legal framework for 
PSI and about plans for PSI infrastructure (ref a).  After 
receipt of additional information (ref b), Croatia\'s Foreign 
Ministry delivered a formal paper on October 7 (full text at 
para 2 below) in which it declares full support for the 
initiative, readiness to cooperate with PSI states and seeks 
to participate in PSI exercises in the Mediterranean. 
 
2.  Begin text of Croatian paper on PSI 
 
POSITION-PAPER ON PROLIFERATION SECURITY INITIATIVE 
 
The Republic of Croatia as a democratic and peace-oriented 
country is deeply engaged in both regional and global 
disarmament and non-proliferation issues. The intensifying of 
transnational threats throughout Europe and elsewhere, global 
terrorism, organized crime as well as refugee crises, 
narcotics smuggling, trafficking in human beings and illegal 
migrations have had both a direct and indirect influence on 
the national security of Croatia. Being situated in an area 
where some smuggling routes from Asia, Africa and Eastern 
Europe converge and cross into Western Europe, Croatia has 
recognized this potential threat and is making it an 
imperative to combat.  For this reason, strengthening and 
raising the efficiency of Croatia\'s border management and 
security system is amongst the priorities for the Government. 
 
Croatia adopted a Law on the Production, Maintenance and 
Trafficking of Arms and Military Equipment, and the Control 
of Export of Dual Use Goods Act is ready to enter the 
parliamentary procedure.  Croatian Government has on 9 May 
2002 accepted the criteria contained in the EU Code of 
Conduct for Arms Exports. 
 
With regard to weapons of mass destruction non-proliferation 
on an international level, Croatia is a party to and active 
participant in all the major international conventions 
dealing with WMD.  This includes the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT); the Convention on the 
Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons; the Convention 
on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons; and the Comprehensive 
Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).  Also, Croatia works closely 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency on many issues in 
its sphere of responsibility, such as with the 
implementations of the Convention on the Physical Protection 
of Nuclear Material. 
 
Annex III Lists 1, 2 and 3 of the Ordinance on Goods Subject 
to Import and Export Licensing regulates the issuance of 
import/export licenses for goods which fall under the list of 
substances relating to the Convention on the Prohibition of 
the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical 
Weapons and on their Destruction. Import/export licenses for 
substances included in the above mentioned lists are granted 
by the Ministry of Economy. 
 
As a State Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and in accordance with the Protocol 
Additional to the Agreement between the Republic of Croatia 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the 
Application of Safeguards in connection with the NPT (Annex 
II) and the Decree on Goods Subject to Import and Export 
Licensing, the import and export of nuclear materials and 
specified equipment on nuclear materials or the use of 
nuclear materials are subject to licensing. Import/export 
licenses for these materials and equipment are issued by the 
Ministry of Economy. 
 
Unfortunately, as September 11 has proved, not all WMD 
threats involve the use of chemical/biological/nuclear 
weapons.  To combat these threats we believe that all 
necessary efforts should be put into establishing much closer 
interstate cooperation between partner countries, especially 
in the exchange of real-time information. Timely exchange of 
information could have a decisive effect on possible 
terrorist activities. Croatia\'s firm position is that only 
through working together with its partners and allies can the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction, missiles and other WMD 
delivery systems be fought effectively. 
 
Taking into account all stated above, Croatia fully supports 
 
the work of Proliferation Security Initiative as described in 
the non-paper presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 
18 September 2003 by the representatives of Australia, 
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, 
Spain, UK and USA. 
 
Croatia is ready to cooperate with the countries participants 
of PSI within the scope of the Initiative and in accordance 
with the national legislation and international law. 
 
Croatia has so far been exchanging information with its 
partners regarding the proliferation of weapons through its 
territory and will continue to observe possible \"suspicious\" 
cargos in its ports, seas, roads or airspace. 
 
Croatia has interest to participate in the exercises within 
the PSI as an observer state. We are especially interested in 
the activities planned to take place in the Mediterranean 
Sea.

REF: ZAGREB 2033 
 
Classified By: Poloff Justin Friedman, reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) With the parliamentary campaign heating up, some 
bilateral issues have been put on hold until they can be 
addressed without political interference.  In separate 
meetings, Presidential Foreign Policy Affairs Advisor Ivica 
Mastruko and MFA Asstant Minister for Non-European Affairs 
Drazen Margeta told the DCM that plans to discuss an ICC 
non-surrender agreement and a deployment of Croatian troops 
to Iraq will have to wait for the next government.  Mastruko 
criticized the Sabor\'s declaration of an economic and fishing 
zone in the Adriatic as a purely political move aimed at 
swaying voters in the upcoming elections.  Margeta said 
movement on IPR issues would also have to wait until after 
the new parliament settles in.  End Summary. 
 
Article 98 
---------- 
 
2. (C) In separate meetings to discuss ongoing U.S. concerns 
about doing business with Libya (septel), DCM express 
continued U.S. interest in pursuing an Article 98 agreement 
with Croatia with Presidential Foreign Policy Affairs Advisor 
Ivica Mastruko on October 6 and MFA Asstant Minister for 
Non-European Affairs Drazen Margeta on October 7.  Mastruko, 
who attended the meeting between President Mesic and A/S 
Rademaker on September 23 in NY, said that President Mesic 
felt Croatia could not sign an Article 98 agreement until 
ICTY indictments of Croatian citizens had been satisfactorily 
resolved.  Mastruko believed that this could be achieved by 
the end of this year, although he noted that the ICTY 
gameplan cited the end of 2004 as the deadline for issuing 
all indictments.   When the DCM noted that the Croatian 
Government had also cited EU restrictions as preventing the 
conclusion of an Article 98 agreement, Mastruko said that the 
president,s position on this issue was &autonomous8 from 
that of the Government.  He suggested that Mesic did not have 
a position regarding EU restrictions. 
 
3. (C) Assistant Minister Margeta reiterated the GoC\'s 
interest in finding a mutually agreeable formulation on 
extradition that would include Article 98-like provisions. 
DCM welcomed Croatian engagement on the issue, but said that 
the proposed framework would not satisfy U.S. needs.  He 
noted that 66 countries had signed Article 98 agreements, 
including Bosnia, Macedonia, Albania and Romania.  Margeta 
responded that Croatia was different from its neighbors, and 
the GoC felt itself under considerable public pressure due to 
the extradition requirements of the ICTY.  Nevertheless, 
Margeta said the GoC would continue to pursue the matter to 
find a solution acceptable to both sides. 
 
4. (C) DCM said that the standard NATO Status of Forces 
Agreement addendum that Post had given the GoC in September 
for review contained language similar to Article 98 without 
mentioning the Article specifically.  GoC agreement to this 
standard language would be welcomed as another positive step. 
 Margeta said the GoC wanted to get military-to-military 
cooperation back on track and asked if this SOFA agreement 
would be enough to secure a waiver of current sanctions under 
the American Serviceman\'s Protection Act (ASPA).  DCM 
responded that while no decisions had been made, Croatia 
would have to build a stronger case for possible waiver.  The 
GoC had taken some positive steps including its contribution 
of troops for Afghanistan and its assistance on the 
successful U.S. Navy ship visit to the BiH port of Neum.  The 
GoC\'s backing away from an Iraq troop contribution was a 
negative that would need to be overcome. 
 
Troops to Iraq 
-------------- 
 
5. (C) In pointing to President Mesic,s statements that 
Croatia should not send a military contingent to Iraq without 
a new UNSCR, DCM pointed out to both interlocutors that a new 
draft resolution was being negotiated in NY and should be 
available soon.  In any event, the government in its June 12 
&determination8 that it would commit troops to Iraq had 
cited in a diplomatic note to the U.S. Embassy cited UNSCR 
1483 as sufficient grounds.  Presidential Advisor Mastruko 
was obviously unaware of the diplomatic note, but made clear 
that the government,s position had changed (reftel). 
Mastruko and Margeta both confirmed that once a new UNSCR had 
been approved, the government would move ahead to gain Sabor 
approval for the deployment. 
6. (C) Assistant Minister Margeta agreed with DCM\'s point 
that the Iraq mission would not be a typical UN peacekeeping 
operation, but more like SFOR or KFOR.  Margeta said that 
 
Croatian forces were continuing to train for this mission and 
were ready to go once a decision had been made.  He commented 
that the GoC wanted to improve bilateral relations, and hoped 
that a UN resolution would facilitate the positive step of a 
GoC troop contribution for Iraq. 
 
Declaration of Fish and Ecology Zone 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Mastruko lamented the Sabor,s decision last Friday to 
declare a fishing and ecology zone in the Adriatic over the 
expressed reservations of the EU, Slovenia and Italy.  He 
predicted that this decision, which was taken solely to 
please the public in advance of the November elections, would 
cause Croatia substantial problems with the EU, 
\"perhaps bigger than Govotina.\"  Mastruko (HNS) sharply 
criticized Sabor leader and HSS party leader Tomcic for 
pushing this proposal through the Sabor.  Mastruko said it 
was the wrong decision taken for the wrong reasons. 
 
7. (C) Margeta observed that the reactions of the EC, Italy 
and Slovenia to the declaration were not as hard as had been 
expected.  He emphasized that Croatia had a legal right to 
make this move, which was motivated primarily over concerns 
for the environment and the fishing economy in the Adriatic. 
He expected that the next important signal would come when 
Prime Minister Racan delivered Croatia\'s answers to the EU 
questionnaire the following Thursday (10/9) in Brussels.  He 
said the GoC would focus diplomatic efforts for the next year 
on explaining the need for this move, emphasizing in 
bilateral discussions with Italy and Slovenia the possibility 
of \"polishing\" the declaration. 
 
ICTY 
---- 
 
8. (C)  Mastruko, who left the meeting with the DCM to join 
President Mesic for his meeting with ICTY Prosecutor Carla 
del Ponte, said he believe that del Ponte already written her 
report to the UN Security Council and was &only going 
through the motions8 in her visit to Zagreb.   Mastruko was 
pleased to hear of the visit by Ambassador Prosper on October 
7.  He noted that the meeting with State Attorney Bajic would 
be very useful but that the meeting with Minister of Justice 
Anticevic-Marinovic would be a waste of time since &she will 
not be in the next government.8   Margeta also welcomed 
Ambassador Prosper\'s visit and asked about what del Ponte 
would be saying to the UN.  DCM responded that del Ponte had 
told the diplomatic community what she had told the GoC; 
namely, that while cooperation on documentary requests was 
improving, the Gotovina issue remained a major problem. 
 
IPR MOU 
------- 
 
9. (SBU)  DCM also briefed Mastruko and Margeta on the IPR 
MOU issue since it has the potential to escalate into a 
significant bilateral irritant.  Croatia was on the watch 
list and could be elevated to the priority watch list. 
Margeta noted this issue was very complex and movement would 
be difficult until after elections and new parliament has 
settled in.  DCM noted that the EU required action on this 
issue by the end of 2004 as a condition of EU membership and 
this issue should be dealt with sooner, rather than later. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) As the parliamentary election campaign heats up, many 
of our core bilateral issues are being put on hold.  Approval 
for sending troops to Iraq, if the next government supports 
it, will certainly have to wait until the necessary 
parliamentary committees are stood up to approve such a 
decision. 
 
11. (C) On Article 98, Since Mesic has consistently supported 
actions to burnish Croatia,s credentials for EU membership, 
we tend to believe that Mesic would in the end acquiesce to 
the government position to follow the EU lead.  In addition, 
the Mesic position to wait until ICTY indictments are 
resolved will put off until next year ) perhaps well into 
next year ) any willingness to sign an Article 98 agreement. 
 Having said that, ultimately the Government and not Mesic 
will decide under what conditions it will sign an Article 98 
agreement.  End Comment.

CHAPTER TWO 
 
REF: ZAGREB 2132 
 
Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C) Croatia\'s transition from socialism through war and 
finally towards integration in Euro-Atlantic institutions has 
led to a proliferation of political parties.  Fully sixteen 
parties are now represented in Croatia\'s parliament and still 
others hope to win seats in the next Sabor.  Some of these 
parties were created when larger parties split; others are 
regional parties in semi-permanent coalition with 
national-level parties. 
 
2.  (C) As the November 23 date for parliamentary elections 
draws near, all of these parties are either recasting 
themselves to appeal to as many voters as possible or are 
trying to align themselves with likely coalition partners to 
ensure they break the five-percent vote threshold to qualify 
for seats in the next parliament and thereby ensure their 
political survival.  This cable is intended to serve as a 
reference.  Taken together with a primer on political 
personalities (ref) and an upcoming guide to Croatia\'s 
electoral rules, we hope it will be useful for those 
following Croatia\'s political race. 
 
========================= 
Parties Now in Opposition 
========================= 
 
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The HDZ of today bears little resemblance to the 
corrupt, nationalist machine of founder Franjo Tudjman, but 
is a long, long way from becoming \"Croatia\'s Republican 
Party\" as party president Ivo Sanader tries to portray it. 
Although he won the presidency of the HDZ in 2000, Sanader 
waited until 2002 to begin a ruthless purge of his rivals in 
the party.  Sanader portrays the purge as \"democratization,\" 
but the main standard used to decide who stayed or went in 
the HDZ was personal loyalty.  The HDZ damaged whatever 
pro-Europe credibility it had when it did not vote to ratify 
Croatia\'s Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with 
the EU in 2001.  Moreover, few observers believe that an HDZ 
government would readily cooperate with ICTY requests to 
surrender \"Croatia\'s heroes\" like PIFWC Ante Gotovina or 
support the calls of the international community on refugee 
return.  Sanader and a handful of other modern-looking 
politicians represent a thin veneer of respectability 
covering up the same old crowd of crony nationalists (absent 
a few of the most rotten apples).  Sanader is desperate to 
lead the HDZ back to government and would consider a deal 
with practically any party to get there. 
 
4.  (C) The HDZ has a rock-solid electorate, mainly rural, 
and relatively uneducated.  Consistently the highest-polling 
party, the HDZ also leads the \"party I\'d never vote for\" 
category, and IRI pollsters opine that the HDZ has topped out 
at 30 percent.  More loyal even than Cubs fans, HDZ voters 
would turn out rain or shine; an election with low turnout 
would help the HDZ. 
 
Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Under the imperious Drazen Budisa\'s leadership, the 
HSLS went from being the second most important party in 
Croatia to the brink of political irrelevance in less than 
three years.  The HSLS is now fighting its way back again, 
but only as a member of the opposition.  Budisa\'s 
egotistical, absolutist leadership brought about two 
destructive splits in the party; first Croatia\'s Liberal 
Party (LS) broke away and more recently a group of centrist 
MP\'s broke away to form the \"Libra\" party and keep a Budisa 
hissy fit from bringing down the Racan government.  Now, the 
HSLS\' main policy platform seems to be \"get Racan\" and Budisa 
seems ready to make any deal to avenge himself on the SDP. 
Without the balance of the eight MP\'s who left to form Libra, 
the HSLS has become more reactionary than the HDZ and would 
oppose any cooperation with ICTY which would impugn the 
\"dignity of the homeland war.\" 
 
6.  (C) The HSLS formed a pre-election coalition with the 
Democratic Center, a group which broke away from the HDZ in 
2000.  Although observers are shocked by this \"unnatural\" 
alliance (Budisa was persecuted by the Tudjman government), 
polls suggest this was a canny political move.  While the 
HSLS and DC were separately polling at three and two percent 
respectively, together they poll more than nine percent, much 
greater than the sum of their parts. 
 
Democratic Center (DC) 
 
 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Mate Granic, who was Tudjman\'s Foreign Minister for 
most of that regime, broke away from the HDZ to form DC with 
two other less-nationalist MP\'s after the elections of 2000. 
Granic expected the HDZ to self-destruct after being thrown 
from office and wanted to give conservative, but not 
nationalist, HDZ members an option.  But when the HDZ held 
together, the DC never got off the ground.  Through tireless 
work, Granic has built a party infrastructure in most parts 
of Croatia, using his personal name recognition to keep DC\'s 
label in the public eye.  Until recently, DC\'s polling 
numbers were disastrous (why vote for \"HDZ-lite\" when you can 
vote for the real thing?), but a coalition with Drazen 
Budisa\'s HSLS has made it likely that DC will break the five 
percent threshold and win seats in the next Sabor. 
 
Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) Long the bastion of Croatia\'s extreme right-wing 
nationalists, the HSP may have damaged its faithful following 
by finally repudiating (in September 2003) Croatia\'s WWII 
fascist government.  Until then, the \"Ustashe\" symbols and 
black-shirted thugs were welcome at HSP rallies.  For most of 
the past three years, the HSP supported Sanader\'s assertions 
of party reform by making the HDZ look reasonable by 
comparison.  With recent polls showing that the HSP might be 
needed to bring a right-wing government to power after 
elections, the HSP leader Anto Djapic is hastily getting rid 
of some of the nationalist trappings which would be most 
objectionable to the international community.  Ironically, 
HSP MP Tonci Tadic is broadly considered to be the Croatian 
parliament\'s hardest-working and usually best-prepared MP. 
 
Croatian Bloc (HB) 
------------------ 
 
9. (C) When Ivic Pasalic, Tudjman\'s former hatchet man, was 
ejected from the HDZ after losing a close, bruising battle 
for the party presidency to Ivo Sanader, he formed the 
\"Croatian Bloc\" party to give his still-faithful followers a 
new political home.  The experiment is failing despite 
Pasalic\'s eager infusions of cash, purportedly from secret 
offshore accounts.  HB supporters are returning to the HDZ 
brand name, and Pasalic may not garner enough votes at the 
next election to win himself a seat in the Sabor.  HB has 
staked out the ideological ground to the right of Sanader\'s 
HDZ (opposing any cooperation with ICTY, urging slower 
rapprochement with Serbia and Montenegro), but to the left of 
HSP.  HB signed a pre-election coalition with Croatian True 
Revival (HIP). 
 
Croatian True Revival (HIP) 
--------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Dissatisfied with Sanader\'s leadership of his 
father\'s party, Miroslav Tudjman founded HiP as a political 
home for all those disappointed with the HDZ\'s 2000 loss. 
HiP did well in 2001 local elections, but soon fizzled, since 
it had little infrastructure and only Tudjman\'s name to trade 
on.  HiP\'s role in its coalition with HB will be to provide 
Croatia\'s dimmest voters with another Tudjman to vote for. 
 
Right-Wing Fringe Parties 
------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) The extreme right-wing is littered with small 
parties trying to stake a claim to Croatia\'s most nationalist 
voters.  Although some of these parties, like the Croatian 
Pure Party of Rights (HChSP) and the Croatian Christian 
Democratic Union (HKDU), will continue to win seats at the 
local level, it is very unlikely that any of them will again 
break the five-percent threshold to win seats in parliament. 
 
========================= 
Parties Now in Government 
========================= 
 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
----------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) Croatia\'s SDP has not gained strength from its three 
years as leader of the ruling coalition in government. 
Although it has shed the ideology of its origins in Croatia\'s 
Party of Communists, the SDP retains some of its worst 
organizational aspects and still struggles to identify its 
own post-socialist political identity.  In pursuing the 
government\'s reform agenda, the SDP has alienated some of its 
natural constituencies, particularly organized labor.  As the 
election approaches, many Croatian voters identify the 
successes of the coalition government with the SDP\'s 
 
 
coalition partners.  The government\'s failures, however, seem 
to have stuck with the SDP, which catches the blame for 
foreign policy gaffes, reductions in the social safety net 
and (according to a recent poll) for being the cause of 
squabbles between coalition partners. 
 
13.  (C) While Croatia\'s other leading parties have updated 
and streamlined their leadership structure in advance of the 
election, the SDP has not.  PM Ivica Racan maintains a firm 
hold on the party presidency, and together with a few party 
leaders like Defense Minister Zeljka Antunovic, Foreign 
Minister Tonino Picula and Labor Minister Davorko Vidovic, 
tries to present a modern, left-of-center image of a \"normal\" 
European Social Democratic party.  But Racan did not take 
advantage of the SDP\'s time in government to bring new blood 
into the top ranks of the leadership and to retire some of 
the figures who look like throwbacks to SDP\'s communist 
roots. 
 
14.  (C) Other parties have cranked up their public-relations 
machines, but the SDP has yet to get going.  Earlier polls 
suggested that the existing coalition had a comfortable 
margin; SDP focused its efforts on how to divide up 
ministerial portfolios rather than on the campaign.  New 
polls show this was folly; the SDP\'s inaction has given the 
opposition a running start.  It may not be too late, however, 
since polls suggest that the biggest block of undecided 
voters are overwhelmingly young and female.  This is where 
the SDP needs to focus if it wants to gain ground in the 
sprint to elections. 
 
15.  (C) The SDP has signed a pre-election coalition 
agreement with the Istrian Democratic Union (IDS).  This 
tactical alliance will probably help the two parties corner 
most of the votes in Istria, Croatia\'s most highly-developed 
region, but has put the noses of some SDP faithful out of 
joint. 
 
Croatian People\'s Party (HNS) 
----------------------------- 
 
16.  (C) With its urban, professional appeal, the HNS has 
grown significantly since elections in 2000.  Despite its 
small representation in the parliament (only two seats), the 
HNS probably benefited most from being in government.  Public 
Works Minister Radimir Cacic (HNS) gets most of the credit 
for a popular highway project and while President Mesic by 
law had to resign from the HNS when he took office, HNS 
strategists never let the public forget where the popular 
president\'s political roots are.  HNS is left-of-center and 
appeals most to younger, educated voters, which puts it in 
competition for the same electorate with which SDP seeks to 
improve its standing.  Conflicts with the SDP, especially in 
the Zagreb city council, have spoiled an otherwise productive 
relationship.  HNS has signed pre-election coalition 
agreements with two much smaller regional parties, one near 
Rijeka, the other in the eastern part of Croatia.  These 
agreements will help both the regional parties and HNS win 
seats in contested districts.  Some say that HNS has not done 
enough to build a party infrastructure outside of Zagreb. 
 
Croatian Peasants\' Party (HSS) 
------------------------------ 
 
17.  (C) As Croatia\'s third-largest party, the HSS has grown 
used to the gravy that being \"kingmaker\" in the coalition 
brings.  Its core constituency is (naturally) rural, older, 
and churchgoing.  Party President (and parliament speaker) 
Zlatko Tomcic rules the party with an iron hand in all 
respects, from policy choices to personnel.  While the HSS 
has in general been a loyal coalition partner, it has 
prevented the GoC from moving forward in some aspects of 
privatization.  Although it is a strong supporter of the 
GoC\'s bid for EU membership, it has taken a back seat on 
foreign policy choices.  The HSS presents itself as a 
right-of-center party, and has a party platform similar to 
that of Christian Democrats elsewhere in Europe.  But HSS 
critics say that the HSS has no ideology; it is only in 
government for what it can get out of it for itself and its 
constituents. 
 
18.  (C) The HSS reorganized itself into regional subunits 
well in advance of elections and has been running a modern, 
American-style campaign at the grass roots.  The HSS declared 
months ago that it will not form any pre-election coalitions. 
 While HSS party leaders tell us privately that they would 
not plan on entering a coalition with the HDZ, most believe 
the HSS would go with whichever side offered them the best 
deal. 
 
Libra 
----- 
 
 
19.  (C) Libra broke away from the HSLS in June 2002 when a 
group of eight MPs chose to stay with the Racan government 
rather than force early elections.  With no time to develop 
an effective national-level infrastructure and no soldiers to 
serve the eight \"generals\" who lead the party, Libra will not 
make it into the next Sabor unless PM Racan chooses to reward 
its loyalty by including a few Libra leaders on SDP\'s list of 
candidates.  Libra\'s centrist, academic approach is effective 
in parliament, but useless in an election campaign. 
 
 
Regional Parties 
---------------- 
 
20.  (C) Istrian Democratic Union (IDS).  The IDS has run 
Croatia\'s western, most developed county since independence, 
despite Tudjman\'s attempts to displace it with the HDZ.  The 
IDS still polls higher than any other party in Istria, but 
party leadership has been tainted by scandal.  The IDS 
generally supports progressive policies at the national 
level, and has championed minority rights in the parliament 
(Istria has a significant Italian minority).  The IDS has 
signed a pre-election coalition agreement (valid only for 
Istria) with the SDP. 
 
21.  (C) Primorsko Goranski Union(PGS). A micro-party in 
Rijeka, Croatia\'s third-largest city, the PGS\' alliance with 
the HNS will likely mean at least one seat in the parliament. 
 PGS has supported the Racan government\'s progressive 
policies, although not formally a member of the coalition. 
 
22.  (C) Croatian Slavonia - Baranya Party (SBSH).  Another 
micro-party, this time from the agricultural heartland of 
eastern Croatia.  This party, although generally more 
conservative than PGS, has formed a pre-election alliance 
with the HNS in one electoral district.

SUBJECT: STATUS OF CROATIAN BIOTECH REGULATIONS 
 
REF: STATE 263456 
 
1.  The following information responds to questions 
reftel, approximately in the order questions were asked. 
 
Entry Into Force 
---------------- 
 
2.  Over the past five months in Croatia, several pieces 
of legislation regulating the importation, cultivation 
and marketing of biotech crops and foods have been 
passed.  Many provisions of these laws are still not in 
force and thus it is difficult to state definitively how 
they will function in practice. 
 
3.  The Law on Consumer Protection was the first biotech- 
related law to be passed.  It was published in the 
government gazette, number 96/03 on June 10, 2003, after 
being approved May 29.  The Food Act was approved by 
Parliament on July 14 and published in government gazette 
number 117 on July 23.  The third law that passed 
Parliament (03/09/03) is the Law on Protection of Nature 
(not yet published in the government gazette).  Since we 
still do not have this law\'s actual text, this cable was 
compiled on the basis of the final draft that went to 
parliamentary procedure.  According to newspapers and 
governmental sources, the amendments made to the final 
text deal only with the restriction of GMO planting in 
national parks, nature parks, and other protected zones, 
as well as in areas intended for ecological agriculture 
and tourism. 
 
4.  Normally laws enter into force eight days after being 
published in the government gazette.  The Consumer 
Protection law was applied 90 days (enforced 8 days) 
after being publishing (it is unclear to us the 
difference being \"being in force\" and \"application,\" but 
these two periods are laid out in the law).  Provisions 
on product labeling from the Consumer Protection Law will 
be regulated by sub-laws.  Until they are enacted, the 
old provisions from the Law on Norms will be applied as 
long as they do not contradict the Law on Consumer 
Protection. 
 
5.  Articles 29, 74 (section 4), and 75 of the Food Law 
will be applied at the latest three years after the law 
came into force.  Article 29 deals with introduction of 
HACCP in food handling and processing facilities. 
Articles 74 (section 4) and 75 deal with authorized 
testing laboratories and reference laboratories for 
official food control. 
 
Regulatory Process 
------------------ 
 
6.  The Law on Protection of Nature is the overarching 
law for biotechnology issues and, together with the Food 
Law and future sub-laws, regulates the importation, 
transshipment, production, usage, and sale of products of 
agricultural biotechnology (all food, feed and seed).  To 
import agricultural biotechnology products into Croatia, 
the importer must, according to the Law on Protection of 
Nature, have a permit for limited usage or intentional 
introduction into the environment before placing the 
product on the market.  \"Limited usage\" is only relevant 
for trials and will not be considered in detail in this 
cable. 
 
-- Procedure for obtaining a permit for intentional 
release into the environment 
 
7.  To introduce a GMO into the environment, a permit 
from the Ministry of Environment is needed, as well as 
the consent of the Ministry of Agriculture.  Before 
applying for a permit, a risk assessment study by an 
authorized company is mandatory (though existing risk 
assessment studies from other sources may be used, with 
the source\'s written consent). 
 
8.  The Minister of the Environment, with the consent of 
the Minister of Agriculture, will specify in special 
regulation the content, scope, and methodology of these 
 
risk assessments, as well as the companies authorized to 
perform the assessment studies.  Before introducing the 
GMO into the environment, a contingency plan (in case of 
uncontrolled spreading of the GMO) is also required.  The 
government will outline the approximate contents and 
application plan of these measures.  The permit 
application must contain: technical documentation with 
prescribed parts, a risk assessment, contingency plan, 
and other relevant data.  The Minister of the Environment 
will describe, in a special regulation with consent of 
the Minister of Agriculture, how to apply for a permit, 
and contents of the permit application.  The Ministry of 
Environment, with consent of Ministry of Agriculture, 
will issue the permit within 90 days of receiving the 
application.  Permits may be issued in an abbreviated 
procedure if there is enough information and experience 
about releasing the particular GMO into the environment. 
In that case, the permit can be issued within 30 days. 
 
-- Procedure for obtaining a permit for placing product 
onto the market 
 
9.  Any GMO placed on the market for the first time 
requires a special permit.  The permit is issued for a 
maximum of 5 years, but is renewable.  Permits for 
products used in agriculture, forestry and fishery are 
issued by an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, with 
the consent of the Ministry of Environment.  Permits for 
foodstuffs are issued by an agency of the Ministry of 
Health, with the consent of the Ministry of Agriculture. 
Before applying for a permit, a risk assessment study is 
mandatory.  The Minister of the Environment with the 
consent of the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister 
of Health will prescribe the contents and scope of the 
risk assessment study, to be laid out in a special 
regulation.  Each application must contain technical 
documentation, a risk assessment study, conditions of 
placing the product on the market, a monitoring plan, a 
time-span proposal for the permit, a labeling proposal, a 
packaging proposal, and a summary of technical 
documentation.  Another permit must be obtained for each 
additional application of approved GMOs.  The Minister of 
the Environment, with the consent of the Minister of 
Agriculture and Minister of Health, will describe the 
required contents of the application and technical 
documentation, and the conditions of monitoring, labeling 
and packaging, in a special regulation.  If placing the 
product on the market causes intentional or unintentional 
introduction of GMOs into the environment, a copy of the 
application will go to the Board for Introduction of GMOs 
into the Environment.  If food or feed will be placed on 
the market a copy of the application will go to the Board 
for Novel Food and Feed.  These boards must report back 
within 60 days of receiving the application. 
 
10.  Additionally, the Food Law requires that all novel 
foods introduced into the market be approved by the 
Minister of Health in agreement with the Minister of 
Agriculture, based on the previously obtained scientific 
expert statement of the Croatian Food Agency.  The 
conditions and the procedure for issuing the approval 
shall be provided by the Minister of Health in 
cooperation with the Minister of Agriculture.

agricultural inspectors, plant protection inspectors, 
state inspectorate inspectors, etc.  The testing 
laboratory will be established by the Ministry of Health 
with support from the Ministry of Agriculture and the 
Ministry of Environmental Protection. 
 
Company penalties for violating the biotech provisions of 
the Law on Protection of Nature will range from Kn 
100,000 to Kn 1,000,000 depending on the violation, with 
responsible employee penalties from Kn 15,000 to Kn 
70,000. 
 
-- Food Law 
 
13.  Oversight is done by sanitary inspectors, border 
sanitary inspectors, veterinary inspectors, border 
veterinary inspectors and other state officials who are 
authorized by a competent Minister. 
 
Company penalties for violating the \"novel food\" 
provisions of the Food Law concerning placing novel food 
on the market or labeling (see below) will be from Kn 
100,000 to Kn 500,000, with each responsible individual 
fined from Kn 5,000 to Kn 10,000. 
 
-- Consumer Protection Law 
 
14.  Oversight (see below on labeling) is done by the 
State Inspectorate and other designated inspectors. 
 
Manufacturer or trader penalties for releasing 
incorrectly labeled (or unlabeled) product on the market 
will range from Kn 50,000 to Kn 100,000 and each 
responsible employee will be penalized from Kn 3,000 to 
Kn 5,000. 
 
The current exchange rate is approximately $1 = Kn 6.5. 
 
Shipments of Biotech Products 
----------------------------- 
 
15.  Shipments of agricultural biotech products should be 
tested in the newly opened biotechnology-testing 
laboratory.  This laboratory is not yet testing samples 
because there are still no specific regulations 
specifying what tests should be done.  Thus, for the 
moment, agricultural biotechnology products can enter 
Croatia undetected.  But there are indications that 
testing will start soon. 
 
Traceability System 
 
------------------- 
 
16.  Traceability as mentioned in the Food Law deals not 
only with biotech products.  It is a system for all 
levels of production, processing and distribution of 
foodstuffs, raw materials of vegetable and animal 
origins, food-producing animals or animals used in food 
production, which includes the tracing of any other sort 
of material intended for incorporation (or which shall be 
incorporated) into food.  Food business operators must 
establish a record keeping system of their suppliers and 
customers.  Food placed on the market must be identified 
by specific documentation or other information. 
 
17.  The Law on Protection of Nature requires that all 
agricultural biotechnology products have documentation 
indicating the product as a GMO or containing GMOs, and a 
correct code that is given to a particular GMO.  All 
companies that place GMOs or products containing GMOs on 
the market must keep a database and have a procedure 
enabling the identification of companies from which the 
product was obtained or to which it was sold, for five 
years after it was placed on the market (excluding end 
consumers). 
 
Documentation 
------------- 
 
18.  For agricultural products that may contain the 
products of agricultural biotechnology, special 
documentation is needed.  Documentation is the same as 
for 100 percent agricultural biotechnology products. 
Unfortunately, there are no specifications yet because 
regulations that should outline documentation are still 
unpublished. 
 
In-country Field Tests 
---------------------- 
 
19.  In-country field tests are not required prior to 
regulatory approval of a biotech crop by current 
legislation (see previous text). 
 
Biotech Approvals 
----------------- 
 
20.  A complete list of the information required by the 
government for biotech crop application consideration 
(under the Law on Protection of Nature, see the procedure 
for obtaining a permit for intentional release into the 
environment) is: technical documentation with specific 
parts (data about the applicant; data on GMO; data on 
conditions of environmental release; data on interaction 
of GMO and environment; monitoring program; data on 
methods of supervision over release of GMO; data on 
handling GMO waste; summary of technical documentation), 
risk assessment of GMO introduction in environment, 
contingency plan (in case of uncontrolled spread of GMO 
in environment), and other relevant data. 
 
Labeling 
-------- 
 
21.  Food and feed containing agricultural biotechnology 
products must be labeled according to the Food Law, the 
Law on Protection of Nature and the Consumer Protection 
Law.  The threshold is still undetermined, but under the 
Law on Protection of Nature, in cases where coincidental 
and technologically unavoidable traces of permitted GMO 
are found, the government can determine the threshold 
below which the products need not be labeled. 
 
22.  According to the Food Law, food and feed labels 
should have additional special information to keep 
consumers informed about any ways in which the novel food 
or its ingredients no longer corresponds to the existing 
food or food ingredient.  In that case, the declaration 
must contain information about the changed 
characteristics or features, including the method used to 
produce that indication or characteristic.  The food and 
food ingredients containing (or consisting of) GMOs must 
have a visible indication that it contains or consists of 
 
GMOs.  The indication must clearly state \"genetically 
modified organisms\" or contain the sentence \"this product 
contains genetically modified organisms.\" Food and food 
ingredients originating from GMOs but not containing them 
must have a visible indication that they originate from 
GMOs. 
 
23.  The requirements regarding the declaration of novel 
food under the Food Law will be provided for by a 
regulation developed by the Minister of Health in 
accordance with the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry 
within one year from enactment of the Law. 
 
24.  According to the Law on Protection of Nature, any 
agricultural biotechnology product placed on the market 
must have a visible mark on its package and accompanying 
documentation stating that the product is a GMO or 
contains GMOs.  This label should clearly say 
\"genetically modified organism\" or contain the sentence 
\"this product contains genetically modified organisms.\" 
 
25.  The Consumer Protection Law establishes minimum 
product labeling requirements, which manufacturers should 
use to identify transformed products, including 
transformed ingredients and supplements, as well as the 
type of transformation, in accordance with special 
regulations.  It is unclear if this is a reference to the 
Food Law (generally considered to be the main legislation 
on labeling), or subsequent implementing regulations for 
the Consumer Protection Law.  The designated Minister 
(depending on the product) will establish the detailed 
content of the label, in concert with other Ministries 
and laws (such as the Food Law) and regulations. 
 
Extent of Labeling 
------------------ 
 
26.  It could be said that all levels of food products 
(i.e. processed and unprocessed) must carry a label. 
 
Other Labeling 
-------------- 
 
27.  Post is unaware of any laws or regulations governing 
the use of labels such as \"biotech-free,\" \"non-biotech,\" 
\"GMO-free,\" or \"non-GMO.\"

FISHING ZONE?

Classified By: Pol/Econ Counselor Nicholas Hill, Reason: 1.5 b and d 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Croatia continues to have trouble with its neighbors 
and the EU over its economic zone waters.  On October 3, the 
Croatia parliament approved the government\'s proposal to 
proclaim an ecological and fishing zone in the Adriatic.  By 
scaling back its earlier plan to declare an exclusive 
economic zone (EEZ), and by deferring implementation of the 
zone for twelve months, the government hopes to blunt the 
wrath of the EU and neighboring countries.  The government 
apparently feared that the EU -- pushed by Italy and Slovenia 
-- would try to limit Croatia\'s options by unveiling at the 
November 25 Mediterranean Fisheries Ministers conference in 
Venice a proposal for a \"joint economic zone.\"  End Summary. 
 
Showing They Can Disagree about Anything... 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) On October 3, the Croatian parliament supported a 
government proposal to declare a fishing and ecological zone, 
a step down from the earlier proposal for an exclusive 
economic zone, with a delay in implementation of 12 months. 
Although the difference between a fishing and ecological zone 
and an EEZ is slight -- both are based on the Convention of 
the Law of the Sea -- the issue has emerged as a bone of 
contention for Croatia\'s ruling coalition.  The largest party 
in the coalition, the Social Democrats (SDP), argued that 
Croatia could avoid worse problems with the EU by scaling 
back the scope of its extension of jurisdiction.  The 
opposition plus the Peasants Party (HSS) -- the ruling 
coalition\'s second largest party -- argued that it would be a 
betrayal of national interests if Croatia did not exert its 
full rights.  In the end, the HSS agreed to the government\'s 
proposal after a non-substantive amendment was added.  With 
eyes on parliamentary elections -- expected on November 23 -- 
all parties saw this as a net political gain with the 
Croatian public. 
 
EEZ Option Endangered 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Andreja Metelko-Zgombic, head of the MFA\'s 
International Legal Department, confirmed that the country 
delegations to the September 24 Brussels prepatory meeting 
for the Venice Conference of Fisheries Ministers had indeed 
urged Croatia not to act unilaterally -- a posture she found 
somewhat hypocritical, given that a number of European 
countries had declared unilaterally fishing and/or ecological 
zones, including in the Mediterranean.  She believed that 
Italy was developing a novel idea for a \"special\" regime for 
the Adriatic.  Croatia has long maintained its right to 
declare an exclusive economic zone, including relevant 
language from the Convention on the Law of the Sea in its 
domestic Maritime Code from 1994.  It would be harder to 
invoke this right, she said, if and when the EU clearly 
stated a preference for a different solution. 
 
4.  (C) Zgombic reaffirmed that Croatia felt confident it 
could and should accommodate Slovenian economic interests in 
fisheries.  She said only two Slovenian boats now enter the 
high seas, mainly to catch sardines for Slovenian canneries. 
Their needs would be addressed easily.  More difficult would 
be Slovenia\'s political needs.  Zgombic said a 1993 Slovenian 
parliamentary declaration set as a Slovenian diplomatic 
imperative \"territorial contact\" with the high seas and 
control over the entire Piran Bay.  She told us that the 
Slovenian position was emotionally charged and, from a legal 
perspective, largely \"irrational.\" 
 
The Adriatic as a European Sea 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) \"The Adriatic must be a European sea,\" said an easily 
exasperated Slovenian diplomat we talked to on October 7. 
Jadran Hocevar, the Political Counselor and sometime DCM, 
told us he was outraged by the Croatian declaration of the 
ecological/fisheries zone.  He said that Slovenia\'s economic 
interests could be more easily accommodated than its 
political interests: \"We have 30 commercial fishermen, 46 and 
a half kilometers of coast, and 1000 years of history.\"  He 
predicted that the declaration would make implementation of 
the 2001 border \"agreement\" between Slovenia and Croatia more 
difficult -- an implausible comment given that the Croatians 
have said over and over again that the deal initialed by 
representatives of the two prime ministers was a dead letter 
already because the Croatian parliament would not ratify it. 
 
Chasing the Few Fish Left 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Hocevar noted that Italian interests would be even 
harder to accommodate than Slovenia\'s.  The Italian side of 
the Adriatic has been fished out almost completely -- a point 
the Italian DCM conceded to us privately.  \"We\'ve over-fished 
our side of the Adriatic,\" he said bluntly during a reception 
last month.  \"We must fish in the eastern half.\"  As a 
result, large Italian fishing vessels regularly ply close to 
-- and occasionally in -- Croatian territorial waters, taking 
advantage of the rich spawning areas off Croatia\'s vast 
network of islands.  While Slovenia caught about 1,500 tons 
of fish a year, and Croatia about 30,000 tons, Hocevar 
estimated Italy\'s catch at \"several hundreds of thousands\" of 
tons.  For their part, the Croatians point to independent 
studies showing that fish stocks in the Adriatic are in steep 
decline. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C) Science and politics have mixed to create the GOC\'s 
current problems over its waters.  The ruling coalition faces 
considerable political pressure to do more to protect its 
waters and diminishing fish stocks.  While it would be easy 
to ascribe the current kerfuffle to GOC incompetence -- a 
default explanation that usually works -- on this issue, the 
government may conceivably be acting shrewdly, although the 
strength of EU displeasure has yet to be measured.  The 
Venice Conference looms large and the GOC may want to improve 
its negotiating posture in advance.  Given its EU-centric 
focus, it will likely cede much to its neighbors -- allowing, 
for example, Italian trawlers to fish in its ecological zone 
and Slovenian ships to enter at will.  What the Croatians 
will not want to cede will be their right under international 
law to declare an ecological and fishing zone.  And they will 
want to exclude vessels from outside the region -- for 
example, Asian fish factory trawlers.  On this point, they 
should not have difficulty gathering a chorus of supporters 
among the participants in Venice.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR REBUFFS EFFORT AT HOLOCAUST DENIAL 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF MITCH BENEDICT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (SBU) ON OCTOBER 10 THE AMBASSADOR CALLED ON ARCHBISHOP 
    JOSIP BOZANIC TO PROTEST A RECENT ARTICLE IN \"GLAS KONCILA,\" 
THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE CROATIAN COUNCIL OF BISHOPS, TITLED 
\"WHY IS THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN THE SERVICE OF ANTI-CROATIAN 
SLANDERERS?\"  MASQUERADING AS COMMENTARY, THE ARTICLE IS 
LITTLE MORE THAN A SCREED ON HOW THE UNITED STATES CONDUCTS 
DIPLOMACY (\"FALLACIES OF THE BIG BROTHER\") AND WHY, BY HAVING 
A LINK ON THE EMBASSY WEB SITE TO THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL 
MUSEUM, WE ARE \"SPREADING FALSEHOOD AND ANTI-CROATIAN 
SLANDER.\" 
 
2. (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD THE ARCHBISHOP -- AND SOON TO BE 
CARDINAL -- THAT THE GLAS KONCILA ARTICLE COULD BE PERCEIVED 
AS AN EFFORT AT HOLOCAUST DENIAL.  IN ADDITION, IT ALLEGED A 
CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF CROATIA ON THE PART OF 
ETHNIC SERBS AND JEWS IN THE UNITED STATES.  SUCH AN ARTICLE, 
THE AMBASSADOR SAID, WOULD ONLY HARM CROATIA, AND THE IMAGE 
OF CROATIA\'S CATHOLIC CHURCH.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT 
THE ARTICLE STOOD IN STARK CONTRAST TO A CLEAR MESSAGE OF 
ETHNIC RECONCILIATION, TOLERANCE, AND PEACE DELIVERED BY THE 
POPE DURING HIS JUNE VISIT TO CROATIA. 
 
3. (C) BOZANIC CLAIMED FIRST NOT TO HAVE READ THE ARTICLE, 
BUT THEN NOTED IT WAS A \"COMMENTARY\" WRITTEN BY A LAYPERSON 
THAT DOES NOT WRITE WELL AND WAS EXPRESSING THE \"IMAGINATION 
OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS.\"  BOZANIC NEXT RECALLED WITH A GLINT IN 
HIS EYE THAT DURING THE TUDJMAN REGIME THE FIRST TOPIC OF 
EVERY DISCUSSION WITH THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR WAS FREEDOM OF 
THE PRESS AND THE NEED FOR NON-INTERFERENCE IN THE MEDIA.  HE 
MAINTAINED THAT AN INDEPENDENT EDITORIAL BOARD, NOT THE 
CHURCH, DETERMINED THE CONTENTS OF GLAS KONCILA. HE SUGGESTED 
THAT SOMEONE IN THE MEDIA COULD WRITE AN APPROPRIATE REPLY -- 
    AND, IF CERTAIN FACTS WERE NOT TRUE, WE SHOULD REFUTE THEM 
DIRECTLY.  WHILE MAINTAINING THE PAPER\'S INDEPENDENCE, 
BOZANIC CONCEDED THAT PREVIOUSLY HE HAD SPOKEN TO \"SOME 
ELEMENTS\" OF THE EDITORIAL BOARD, ON \"SOME ASPECTS OF SOME 
ISSUES.\" 
 
4. (C) BOZANIC DEFENDED THE AUTHOR, SAYING HE AND HIS ENTIRE 
FAMILY CAME FROM THE VOJVODINA REGION OF SERBIA, \"WHERE THEY 
SUFFERED AND SUFFERED WOUNDS,\" AND THAT FOR SUCH PEOPLE IT 
WILL TAKE GENERATIONS FOR THOSE WOUNDS TO HEAL.  THE 
AMBASSADOR UNDERSCORED AGAIN THAT THE ARTICLE SERVED NO 
POSITIVE PURPOSE, AND IN FACT WAS AN EGREGIOUS AFFRONT TO 
THOSE WORKING TO PROMOTE A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL CROATIANS. 
BOZANIC THANKED THE AMBASSADOR AND SAID HE WOULD \"TAKE 
CERTAIN STEPS,\" ALTHOUGH HE CAUTIONED ONE FINAL TIME THAT 
GLAS KONCILA IS NOT AN OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
IN CROATIA. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) THE MEETING WITH BOZANIC TOOK PLACE ON THE EVE OF HIS 
DEPARTURE FOR ROME, WHERE HE ATTENDED THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
JOHN PAUL II\'S PAPACY AND WILL REMAIN FOR HIS ELEVATION TO 
CARDINAL ON OCTOBER 21.   THE VATICAN REACHED BACK IN THE 
RANKS WHEN IT APPOINTED BOZANIC ARCHBISHOP IN 1997.  ALTHOUGH 
A MODERATE BY REPUTATION, HE WILL NOT ROCK THE BOAT IN 
DEALING WITH THE LARGELY CONSERVATIVE AND NATIONALIST 
HIERARCHY OF THE CHURCH IN CROATIA.  THE ARTICLE WILL ONLY 
LEND STRENGTH TO THE ARGUMENT THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN 
CROATIA REMAINS MORE A PART OF THE PROBLEM THAN THE SOLUTION 
    IN TERMS OF PROMOTING ETHNIC TOLERANCE, RECONCILIATION, AND 
THE \"NORMAL\" LIFE SOUGHT BY ALL CROATIANS.

    1.  SUMMARY:  THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED ON OCTOBER 
17, THE FIRST FORMAL STEP IN A SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH WILL 
LEAD TO ELECTIONS ON NOVEMBER 23.  PRESIDENT MESIC TOOK THE 
SECOND STEP ON OCTOBER 20, WHEN HE FORMALLY SET THE DATE FOR 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  CROATIA\'S ELECTORAL LAW REMAINS 
GENERALLY UNCHANGED SINCE THE LAST PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN 
JANUARY 2000, DESPITE OSCE CALLS FOR AN OVERHAUL. 
NONETHELESS, THE CONSENSUS OF ALL POLITICAL OBSERVERS AND 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTED IN CROATIA IS THAT 
THE NOVEMBER 23 POLL WILL BE GENERALLY FREE AND FAIR.  THIS 
ASSESSMENT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE LAW BUT 
ALSO A POLITICAL CULTURE WHICH OSCE ASSERTS HAS \"IRREVOCABLY 
CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.\"  THIS TELEGRAM, TOGETHER WITH 
DESCRIPTIONS OF LEADING POLITICAL FIGURES AND OF CROATIA\'S 
POLITICAL PARTIES (REFS) IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS A REFERENCE 
FOR THOSE FOLLOWING CROATIA\'S ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CROATIA\'S FIRST REFORM SABOR DISSOLVES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  AFTER A FRENZY OF PASSING LAST-MINUTE LEGISLATION 
FOLLOWED BY A SERIES OF FORMAL SPEECHES OF FOND RECOLLECTION 
AND EVEN RECONCILIATION, CROATIA\'S PARLIAMENT (SABOR) 
DISSOLVED ITSELF ON THE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 17, 2003.  THE 
MOVE TOOK PLACE ACCORDING TO AN AGREEMENT MADE PUBLIC BY 
COALITION LEADERS WELL IN ADVANCE.  CROATIA\'S CONSTITUTION 
REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT TO SET AN ELECTION DATE NOT MORE THAN 
60, BUT NOT LESS THAN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THE SABOR\'S 
DISSOLUTION.  ON OCTOBER 20, PRESIDENT MESIC CARRIED OUT THIS 
DUTY AND ANNOUNCED THAT THE ELECTION WILL TAKE PLACE ON 
NOVEMBER 23, AS EXPECTED.  FROM THE MOMENT SPEAKER ZLATKO 
    TOMCIC GAVELED THE SABOR CLOSED ON NOVEMBER 17 UNTIL THE NEXT 
PARLIAMENT TAKES POWER, ALL OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE SABOR IS 
VESTED IN PM RACAN\'S CABINET.  FEW OBSERVERS, HOWEVER, EXPECT 
THE LAME-DUCK GOVERNMENT TO MISUSE THIS AUTHORITY. 
 
ELECTION SCHEDULE NOW FIXED 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) NOW THAT PRESIDENT MESIC HAS OFFICIALLY FIRED THE 
STARTING GUN, THE REST OF CROATIA\'S ELECTORAL SCHEDULE IS 
SET.  POLITICAL PARTIES (AND INDEPENDENT POLITICAL GROUPS) 
HAVE FOURTEEN DAYS TO SUBMIT THEIR LISTS OF CANDIDATES TO THE 
STATE ELECTORAL COMMISSION (SEC).  THE SEC THEN HAS 48 HOURS 
TO REVIEW THE LISTS, AND ONCE THEY ARE CERTIFIED, THE FORMAL 
CAMPAIGN BEGINS.  THE \"OFFICIAL\" CAMPAIGN WILL THEREFORE 
BEGIN ON NOVEMBER 5 AND WILL LAST UNTIL MIDNIGHT ON NOVEMBER 
21, WHEN \"ELECTION SILENCE\" RULES GO INTO EFFECT. 
 
FEW CHANGES TO CROATIA\'S ELECTION LAW ... 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) CROATIA\'S ELECTORAL LAW WAS CRITICIZED BY THE OSCE\'S 
OFFICE FOR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS (ODIHR) 
AFTER THE JANUARY 2000 POLL.  ODIHR THEN MADE SPECIFIC 
SUGGESTIONS ON HOW THE LEGISLATION COULD BE CHANGED TO ENSURE 
A MORE PROFESSIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS. 
DESPITE THE BEST INTENTIONS OF SOME OF THE SABOR\'S LEADING 
CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERTS, THE LAW REMAINS ESSENTIALLY 
UNCHANGED.  WHEN CROATIA\'S POLITICAL THEORISTS GAVE UP THE 
TASK OF ELECTION LAW OVERHAUL IN EARLY 2003, POLITICAL 
REALISTS TOOK OVER; TWO CHANGES -- ONE COSMETIC AND ONE 
    SIGNIFICANT -- TO THE EXISTING LAW WERE PASSED.  THESE 
MODIFICATIONS TOOK CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE OF CROATIA\'S 
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH INTO ACCOUNT (THE PARLIAMENT\'S IRRELEVANT 
UPPER HOUSE WAS ABOLISHED IN 2001) AND -- MORE IMPORTANTLY -- 
WHEN THE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES WAS 
PASSED, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF GUARANTEED SEATS TO 
REPRESENTATIVES OF CROATIA\'S MANY ETHNIC MINORITY WAS 
INCREASED FROM THREE TO EIGHT. 
 
... BUT \"FREE AND FAIR\" POLL EXPECTED 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) DESPITE THE GOC\'S FAILURE TO CHANGE THE ELECTION LAW, 
ODIHR EXPERTS HAVE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THEY TERMED 
A \"SEA CHANGE\" IN THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN CROATIA.  AN 
ODIHR EXPERT TEAM WHICH VISITED ZAGREB FROM SEPTEMBER 16 - 19 
CITED CONFIDENCE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS BY ALL RELEVANT

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) USDOC Market Access and Compliance Office 
Director, Susanne Lotarski, delivered a strong message 
to the Croatian government to forward the long-stalled 
bilateral MOU on intellectual property rights.  During 
an October 14-15 visit to Zagreb, she urged authorities 
to ratify the MOU or face possible trade sanctions under 
the U.S. Special 301 process.  Lotarski also emphasized 
the relation between strong IP protection, business 
ethics and rule-of-law -- all of which investors judge 
when evaluating a country.  Her warning came on the 
heels of a similarly forceful warning by the Ambassador, 
most recently with Deputy Prime Minister Simonic 
(reftel).  End Summary. 
 
\"Ashamed\" MOU Did Not Move Forward 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) In her October 14 meeting with Minister of 
Economy Ljubo Jurcic, Lotarski noted that a lack of 
progress on the part of the Croatian government on the 
intellectual property memorandum of understanding 
endangered some of the positive aspects of the bilateral 
relationship.  She said the U.S. is disappointed in the 
failure of the government to include data exclusivity in 
the recent drug law -- especially since protection of 
confidential test data is required by the WTO and the 
 
SIPDIS 
EU.  There was a good chance Croatia would be moved up 
on the 301 list during a fall out-of-cycle review.  This 
was an escalation in a process that could lead to trade 
sanctions, such as removal of GSP benefits -- and not 
only on pharmaceuticals. 
 
3.  (SBU) Jurcic said the Ministry of Economy supported 
WTO principles and the U.S. position on the MOU.  The 
Ministry of Health, on the other hand, supported 
Croatian pharmaceutical producers and Croatian 
consumers.  However, the visit of the Ambassador to the 
Deputy Prime Minister and the delivery of the non-paper 
had made an impression on the government, and the issue 
was being revisited. 
 
4.  (SBU) Acting Deputy Economy Minister Olgica Spevec, 
also at the meeting, recalled that she had assured the 
Embassy last fall that the MOU would probably make it to 
the parliament early in 2003.  She was frankly ashamed 
that the GOC had not lived up to its obligations, and 
noted that lately the Ministry of Economy had been left 
out of meetings on this issue, perhaps because the 
government did not like its stance.  Spevec asked 
whether the U.S. would consider amending the agreement, 
or at least adding a phase-in period.  We noted that the 
phase in contemplated in the MOU had already expired -- 
in 1999.  Lotarski reported that all EU accession 
countries had accepted strong IP provisions.  Even 
Poland, with whom we had had the most trouble, had 
implemented data exclusivity, if not for as long a 
period as we would like. 
 
MOH: Cheap Drugs the Priority 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Lotarski met the same day with Minister of 
Health, Ivo Vlahusic, and Director of Drug Approvals, 
Csaba Dohoszky, to deliver the same message.  Vlahusic 
was forthright in saying that as Minister of Health, 
with primary responsibility for the welfare of 
Croatians, he had to oppose the MOU.  However, as a 
member of the ruling coalition, if the government told 
him to go along with the MOU, he would.  (Note:  the 
Ministry of Health did indeed allow data exclusivity 
language to be inserted into the recent drug law.  It 
was, we were told, a call from Pliva to the Prime 
Minister that resulted in the yanking of that 
provision.) 
 
6.  (SBU) Dohoszky asserted that \"Croatia is not the 
only country where intellectual property protection is 
not what the big multinationals want.\"  While Croatia 
did not face the same problems that under-developed 
countries did, generics are still vital to its health 
system.  Lotarski countered that the USG was not anti- 
 
 
generic, but it did demand a level playing field.  It 
was not fair that an innovative company had to submit 
test data, which was then used by a generics company as 
a basis for the latter\'s registration.  To add insult to 
injury, in Croatia, the (Croatian) generics company was 
likely to get its registration months, sometimes years, 
before the innovative company for the same drug, while 
benefiting from the innovative company\'s test data.  It 
came down to whether Croatia wanted to be known as a 
country with good business ethics and rule-of-law. 
 
7.  (SBU) Lotarski also pointed out that Croatia had 
received U.S. support for its WTO entry in return for 
the MOU.  \"It would be fair to ratify the MOU, Vlahusic 
admitted, adding, however, that the promise to ratify 
the MOU in exchange for your support for our WTO entry 
was an \"oral agreement.\"  Nevertheless, the Minister 
promised to contact the Croatian pharmaceutical industry 
and ask whether it would maintain its position in the 
face of possible trade sanctions.  He would also consult 
with the MFA and the government.  Commercial Counselor 
Beryl Blecher urged Vlahusic to meet with the foreign 
pharmaceutical producers as well. 
 
8.  (SBU) Dohoszky highlighted a problem that he said 
could be more acute than data exclusivity -- that is, 
\"retroactive patent protection,\" otherwise known as 
pipeline protection.  \"We all know that data exclusivity 
is inevitable, but this pipeline protection could really 
bust the health care budget if there is a big 
retroactive effect.\"  Would it be possible, the drug 
approval director asked, to modify the MOU or add a 
supplement to take the sting out of the pipeline 
protection provision?  Lotarski citing the importance of 
pipeline protection to the U.S., reported that Hungary 
had raised the same objections, but resolved its issues. 
 
MFA Will Try to Push Rock Back Up Hill 
-------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Lotarski met also with Drazen Margeta, MFA 
Assistant Minister for Non-European countries.  Margeta 
emphasized the importance the GOC placed on its 
relationship with the U.S., highlighting recent joint 
military exercises.  Lotarksi described the threat that 
the failure to forward the MOU to the parliament posed 
to the relationship.  Margeta said his Ministry would 
try to forward the MOU to the Cabinet for approval -- 
again.  The MFA completed the procedure earlier this 
year, only to have the MOU shelved at the Cabinet level, 
apparently because of opposition from Croatian industry. 
 
10.  (SBU) Miro Kovacic, head of the Americas Desk, also 
said that pipeline protection had been raised as an 
important issue by Croatian drug makers.  They were 
floating the figure of 100 million euro as the extra 
cost to the Croatian health system of data exclusivity 
and pipeline protection.  Lotarski noted that other 
Central European countries had been asked to provide 
this protection, and found it worthwhile, when looking 
at the overall economic effect.  Competition and the 
health care system suffered if innovative drug makers 
did not want to bring new drugs into the market.  At the 
end of the day, a country could not use theft to balance 
its health care books, and a country had to live up to 
its word, even when governments changed. 
 
MOU is Not EU Accession Problem 
------------------------------- 
 
11.  (SBU) Lotarski\'s final meeting was with Orsat 
Miljenic, Deputy Minister of EU Integration.  Miljenic 
noted that the Ministry saw no reason to object to 
ratification of the MOU.  Updated intellectual property 
protections were clearly required by the EU, and his 
ministry wanted to meet EU standards as soon as possible 
-- regardless of Croatia\'s EU accession date. 
Convergence with EU standards wase good for Croatia 
regardless, he said, noting that Croatia aspired to be a 
\"virtual member\" of the EU, even before entry. 
 
Comment and recommendation 
-------------------------- 
 
12.  (SBU) With elections expected on November 23, 
action on the MOU is unlikely in the very short term, 
but a new government could take up the issue in January. 
Although the Parliament was dissolved on October 17 in 
 
 
anticipation of elections, we would like to see the new 
government -- which will likely be in place by early 
January -- act on this issue quickly.  Only increased 
outside pressure will move this issue forward in the 
face of fierce resistance from the local generics 
manufacturers.  To keep up the pressure, we would 
recommend accepting an out-of-cycle U.S. industry 
petition for Croatia and urge that Washington agencies 
move Croatia to the Priority Watch List.

SUBJECT: CROATIA\'S PROGRESS ON REFORMS THREATENED BY 
RIGHT-WING GAINS IN POLLS 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) New polls show that the reform-oriented parties which 
formed the Racan government are trailing Croatia\'s right-wing 
nationalist opposition in the race for November 23 
parliamentary elections.  Unless the current coalition turns 
it around -- and pollsters tell us they could still manage 
this -- Croatia could have a government led by the HDZ and 
including even more extreme nationalist parties before the 
end of the year.  While the HDZ is no longer the party of 
Franjo Tudjman and has been supportive of the U.S. position 
on Iraq, the return of a nationalist government now would 
mean less cooperation with ICTY, a slowdown in improving 
relations with Serbia and Montenegro, more hesitance in 
implementing refugee returns and would likely not deliver a 
deployment to Iraq. 
 
2.  (C) While Croatia has matured as a state beyond the point 
where it would be appropriate -- or helpful -- for the USG to 
back one political option or the other openly, there are some 
steps we could take to avoid adding to the largely 
self-inflicted misfortunes facing Racan\'s coalition.  We are 
already sponsoring a vigorous get-out-the vote campaign 
targeted at voters likely to support a reform agenda.  In 
addition, we should defer tough messages calling for stepping 
up the pace of reform until after elections.  We should also 
seek opportunities to show Croatia\'s voters that we recognize 
the achievements -- such as they are -- of the Racan 
government.  End Summary. 
 
Racan Coalition Trailing in Polls 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) A USAID-sponsored IRI poll released in early October 
shows that the coalition led by PM Racan\'s SDP is in real 
trouble as it begins the sprint for November 23 parliamentary 
elections.  The Racan coalition brought the trouble on 
itself; polls in late Summer showed progressive parties with 
a slim (but comfortable) lead and momentum behind them. 
Rather than building on their lead, coalition political 
leaders coasted, and have only recently begun campaigning in 
earnest.  To add insult to injury, the GoC continues to 
fumble politically-sensitive policy issues, like its recent 
mishandling of a unilateral declaration of an exclusive 
economic zone in the Adriatic. 
 
4.  (C) The IRI poll shows HDZ with a ten-point lead over 
Racan\'s SDP.  More alarming is that this gain is not being 
made at the expense of other, more extreme right-wing 
parties, but from the large pool of undecided voters.  IRI 
pollsters tell us that, if the election were held now, the 
HDZ and its ilk would win enough support to form a 
government.  If coalition parties take decisive action, they 
may be able to turn this trend around, particularly if they 
can show voters that a vote for the HDZ is a vote against 
Croatia\'s aspirations to join the EU. 
 
Reforms in Jeopardy 
------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Croatia\'s voters and the international community had 
high expectations of the Racan government.  While the 
government has not met many of these expectations, it has 
made progress on some important reforms.  This progress, 
which has transformed Croatia from a net consumer of security 
in the region to a net producer, is at risk if a right-wing 
government with revanchist elements comes to power. 
 
At Risk: ICTY Cooperation and Refugee Return 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) We have been frustrated with the Racan government\'s 
progress on ICTY cooperation and refugee return, but the 
alternative is worse.  The HDZ has made it clear that they 
view PIFWC Ante Gotovina as a \"hero, not a criminal.\"  The 
HSLS, which would be the HDZ\'s coalition partner, has 
declared that it would seek to change Croatia\'s law which 
makes cooperation with the  Tribunal obligatory.  Current GoC 
officials have privately expressed serious concerns to us 
about their ability to protect police operatives who have 
been involved in the search for indicted war criminals should 
a right-wing government come to power.  On returns, despite 
our urging, the HDZ has not encouraged local leaders to 
facilitate refugee returns; an HDZ government would not 
improve even the Racan government\'s mixed record. 
 
 
7.  (C) The Racan government has made important progress 
toward building good-neighborly relations with Serbia and 
Montenegro.  While some of its achievements -- like the 
Prevlaka agreement -- cannot be reversed, others would be at 
risk and the pace of rapprochement would certainly slow. 
Croatia under Racan has severed inappropriate links to Croats 
in BiH.  HDZ President Sanader has told us privately that his 
party has dropped the Tudjman-era policies harmful to Dayton, 
but he nonetheless is campaigning in the hard-line Croat 
areas of BiH using nationalist themes. 
 
8.  (C) Sanader\'s public statements on Iraq have been music 
to our ears, but it is unlikely that an HDZ government would 
be able to deliver the two-thirds parliamentary majority 
required to deploy a Croatian contingent to Iraq.  A Sanader 
cabinet would not consider itself bound by the Racan 
Cabinet\'s June 12 political decision (not ratified by 
parliament before it dissolved) to deploy troops to Iraq. 
Several of Sanader\'s likely coalition partners have already 
taken public positions against deployment. 
 
What to Do? 
----------- 
 
9.  (C) There is little that we can -- or should -- do to 
influence the outcome of the November 23 elections.  But with 
the parliament dissolved and the Racan government in 
caretaker status until elections, there is no value in 
pushing Croatia to take new action on reforms until a new 
government is seated.  We would instead advocate looking for 
ways to highlight the accomplishments of the Racan government 
and the progress Croatia has made toward Euro-Atlantic 
institutions under its stewardship.  The upcoming meeting of 
the Adriatic Charter Partnership in Washington may provide us 
with an opportunity to make this point.  More welcome for the 
Racan government and far more useful from an election 
standpoint would be messages of support from EU countries or 
international organizations.

1. (U) ON OCTOBER 22, WE VISITED DJULOVAC MUNICIPALITY TO 
OPEN A USAID AND EUCOMM FUNDED SCHOOL REHABILITATION PROJECT, 
A COMMUNITY CENTER, AND A ROAD PROJECT.  SMILING VILLAGERS, 
SINGING STUDENTS, AND TABLES LADEN WITH LOCAL DELICACIES AND 
HOMEMADE BRANDIES GREETED US, THE LOCAL POLITICAL 
ESTABLISHMENT, AND UNTOLD OTHERS AT THREE RIBBON CUTTING 
CEREMONIES.  AS IF IT WAS HIS DAUGHTER\'S WEDDING, MAYOR MILAN 
GRAHOVAC, OF THE CROATIAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (HSS), ATTENDED TO 
EVERY DETAIL AT A SIT DOWN LUNCH FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE 
HUNDRED.   IT IS ELECTION TIME IN CROATIA, AND INCUMBENTS ARE 
TAKING EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE WHO IS BRINGING HOME 
THE BACON.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A GOOD DAY IN DJULOVAC 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) ON OCTOBER 22 THE AMBASSADOR AND USAID DIRECTOR 
VISITED DJULOVAC MUNICIPALITY IN WESTERN SLAVONIA TO OPEN AN 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT, A COMMUNITY CENTER, 
AND AN 8 KM ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT.  USAID SPENT 
APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION AND EUCOMM AN ADDITIONAL $220,000 
IN THE MUNICIPALITY, WHICH HAS A POPULATION OF JUST OVER 
4,100.  THE MUNICIPALITY, OVER TWO HOURS BY CAR DUE EAST OF 
ZAGREB, WAS ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE 1991-1995 WAR, LYING 
THE FARTHEST NORTH THAT SERB PARAMILITARIES PENETRATED IN 
CENTRAL CROATIA.  DURING THE WAR 55 PERCENT OF THE REGION\'S 
HOUSING STOCK WAS EITHER BADLY DAMAGED OR DESTROYED.  SIX 
    VILLAGES WERE COMPLETELY DESTROYED AND REMAIN UNINHABITED 
TODAY. 
 
3. (U) THE MAJORITY OF ETHNIC SERBS LIVING IN THE REGION FLED 
IN THE BEGINNING OF 1992.  THE TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT ALLOCATED 
EMPTY HOMES BELONGING TO ETHNIC SERBS FOR THE \"TEMPORARY USE\" 
OF 1,950 KOSOVO CROATS AND 250 BOSNIA CROATS WHO SETTLED IN 
THE AREA.  WHILE THE POPULATION HAS NEARLY RETURNED TO ITS 
PREWAR LEVEL, THE COMPOSITION HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY, AND 
THE CHALLENGE REMAINS TO FIND PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS FOR 
SETTLERS (KOSOVAR AND BOSNIAN CROATS) SO THAT PROPERTIES CAN 
BE RETURNED TO OWNERS (SERBS). 
 
4. (U) IN A MODEL OF COOPERATION, IN 2001 THE MUNICIPAL 
AUTHORITIES, ASSOCIATION OF KOSOVO CROATS \"LETNICA,\" AND THE 
NGO \"SERB DEMOCRATIC FORUM\" PRESENTED A JOINT PLAN FOR 
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE GOC AND INTERNATIONAL 
DONORS.  FUNDING WAS SECURED, AND THE PLAN HAS BEEN 
SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED, AS EVIDENCED BY INCREASED RETURNS 
OF REFUGEES.   HOWEVER, UNEMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC STAGNATION 
REMAIN THE MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR THE REGION.  ACCORDING TO 
OFFICIAL FIGURES ONLY 350 PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN THE 
MUNICIPALITY, WITH OVER HALF IN THE FORESTRY INDUSTRY. 
OUTSIDE SMALL-SCALE AGRICULTURAL BASED PRODUCTION -- HONEY, 
WINE, AND CRAFTS -- FEW REAL POSSIBILITIES EXIST FOR THE 
HILLY AND ISOLATED REGION. 
 
5. (SBU) DJULOVAC AND ITS ENVIRONS IS A STRONGHOLD OF THE 
HSS, THE SECOND LEADING PARTY IN THE RULING COALITION AND THE 
THIRD LARGEST PARTY IN PARLIAMENT.  WHILE MORE COMFORTABLE 
SITTING ON A TRACTOR THAN BEHIND A DESK, GRAHOVAC, LIKE ANY 
    POLITICAL PRO, WAS QUICK TO SEE THE CAMPAIGN ADVANTAGES 
INHERENT IN THE DAY\'S EVENTS.  THE RECONSTRUCTION AND 
BUILDING PROVIDED EMPLOYMENT, AND THE SCHOOLS WERE SORELY 
NEEDED FOR THE LARGER AND BURGEONING POPULATION OF 700 
SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN -- A \"SMALL\" FAMILY OF KOSOVAR CROATS HAS 
SIX CHILDREN. 
 
6. (SBU) THE MAYOR HAD LONG LOOKED FORWARD TO THE THE DAY\'S 
CELEBRATIONS, WHICH CULMINATED IN A HUGE LUNCH IN THE TOWN\'S 
MAIN HALL.   LIKE THE FATHER OF THE BRIDE, GRAHOVAC WENT FROM 
TABLE-TO-TABLE -- FIREMEN, TEACHERS, CIVIC AND BUSINESS 
LEADERS -- MAKING SURE EVERYONE\'S GLASS WAS FULL.  HSS 
LEADERS, INCLUDING TWO ADDITIONAL HSS COUNTY PREFECTS FROM 
NEIGHBORING COUNTIES --  WERE CONFIDENT THEY WOULD DOMINATE 
THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS IN THE REGION.  THE BAND -- WE WERE 
TOLD A MIXED SERB AND CROAT ENSEMBLE -- PLAYED ON, AND FOR 
ONE DAY, AT LEAST, DESPITE WHATEVER PROBLEMS THERE MAY BE, 
THERE WAS SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE IN DJULOVAC.

SUBJECT: ONCE AGAIN, NO DOUBLE VOTE FOR MINORITIES IN 
CROATIA 
 
1. THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT VOTED LAST MONTH TO DENY A DOUBLE 
VOTE TO ETHNIC MINORITY VOTERS IN THE NATIONAL ELECTIONS SET 
    FOR NOVEMBER 23.  THE \"DOUBLE VOTE\" WOULD HAVE PERMITTED 
OFFICIALLY-DESIGNATED MINORITIES TO VOTE TWICE ON ELECTION 
DAY, ONCE FOR GENERAL PARTY LISTS, AND ONCE FOR AN ETHNIC 
REPRESENTATIVE.  THE ISSUE WAS BROUGHT TO THE PARLIAMENT\'S 
COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION, WHICH DETERMINED THAT THE 
CONSTITUTION, THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES, 
AND THE ELECTORAL LAW ALL CLEARLY DEFINE THAT MINORITY 
MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE DOUBLE VOTING RIGHTS.  SEVENTY-ONE MPS 
VOTED IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE, 33 OPPOSED, AND FOUR 
ABSTAINED.  THOSE IN FAVOR OF DENYING THE DOUBLE VOTE TO 
ETHNIC MINORITIES INCLUDED A CROSS SECTION OF BOTH THE RULING 
COALITION AND OPPOSITION PARTIES. 
 
2. MILORAD PUPOVAC, CHAIR OF THE SERB NATIONAL COUNCIL (SNV), 
AND CANDIDATE OF THE INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATIC SERB PARTY 
(SDSS), COMPLAINED ABOUT THE DECISION AND TOLD US HE PLANNED 
TO APPEAL IT ONCE AGAIN TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.  PUPOVAC 
AND FURIO RABIN, CROATIA\'S LEADING ETHNIC ITALIAN MP, HAVE 
BEEN THE LEADING ADVOCATES PUSHING FOR A DECISION IN SUPPORT 
OF DOUBLE VOTING RIGHTS FOR MINORITIES. 
 
3. DOUBLE VOTING WOULD HAVE ENSURED PUPOVAC\'S ELECTION AS AN 
ETHNIC SERB REPRESENTATIVE TO PARLIAMENT.  IN THE PREVIOUS 
ELECTION HE LOST THE RACE FOR THE ONLY ETHNIC SERB SEAT BY 
APPROXIMATELY 2,000 VOTES TO MILAN DJUKIC, WHO WON BECAUSE UP 
TO 80 PERCENT OF ALL ETHNIC VOTERS CHOSE TO VOTE ON THE PARTY 
LISTS -- LEAVING ONLY THE SO-CALLED \"HARD LINERS\" MORE IN 
SYNC WITH DJUKIC\'S CONFRONTATIONAL POLITICS TO VOTE ON THE 
ETHNIC LIST.  DOUBLE VOTING WOULD HAVE ALSO OPENED THE WAY 
FOR PUPOVAC TO SPEND MORE TIME ENCOURAGING MINORITY VOTERS TO 
SUPPORT THE RULING CENTER-LEFT COALITION -- IN EFFECT 
    ENSURING A FUTURE POLITICAL PAYOFF FOR \"DELIVERING\" THE SERB 
VOTE TO RACAN. 
 
4. IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE, MILAN DJUKIC, THE SOLE MP 
ELECTED IN 2000 TO REPRESENT ETHNIC SERBS IN THE SABOR, 
OPPOSED THE DOUBLE VOTE FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES.  DJUKIC\'S 
POSITION IS PARTLY PRAGMATIC -- IT WOULD NEVER PASS 
PARLIAMENT -- BUT MOSTLY PERSONAL.  THE REALITY OF ONE-MAN 
ONE-VOTE IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF ETHNIC SERB VOTERS HAVE AND 
WILL VOTE FOR THE SDP AND OTHER NATIONAL PARTIES OF THE 
CENTER-LEFT.  IF PROVIDED WITH A SECOND \"ETHNIC\" VOTE, MANY 
OF THOSE VOTERS, SOCIAL DEMOCRATS BY INCLINATION, WOULD MORE 
LIKELY CAST THEIR ADDITIONAL VOTE FOR PUPOVAC OR OTHER 
\"MODERATE\" CENTER-LEFT ETHNIC SERBS CANDIDATES.  HENCE, 
DJUKIC IS CONTENT TO HAVE ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF ETHNIC 
SERBS VOTE ON THE ETHNIC SERB LIST BECAUSE THOSE WHO VOTE 
TEND TO BE MORE \"HARD-LINE\" NATIONALISTS.  TO SOLIDIFY HIS 
SUPPORT AMONG SUCH VOTERS, DJUKIC IN RECENT MONTHS HAS RAMPED 
UP THE RHETORIC OF VICTIMIZATION OF SERBS AND CRITICISM OF 
THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. NOVEMBER 5 MARKS THE OFFICIAL BEGINNING OF CROATIA\'S 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND THE ISSUE OF DOUBLE VOTING FOR 
MINORITIES IS NOW RESOLVED, AT LEAST FOR THIS CYCLE.  BUT 
PUPOVAC PROBABLY NEED NOT WORRY SO MUCH: ONE OF THE 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE RACAN GOVERNMENT WAS TO CHANGE THE 
ELECTION LAW TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF GUARANTEED SEATS IN 
PARLIAMENT FOR MINORITIES TO EIGHT, INCLUDING THREE FOR 
    CROATIA\'S SERBIAN COMMUNITY.  THIS TIME AROUND MOST OBSERVERS 
THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR DJUKIC AND PUPOVAC -- AND BOTH ARE 
CAMPAIGNING HARD.  WE SAW PUPOVAC ON THE STUMP RECENTLY IN 
KNIN, PUTTING ALL HIS BEST ORATORY SKILLS -- HE IS A 
PROFESSOR OF RHETORIC AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ZAGREB -- TO THE 
TEST.  WHILE SOME PROPONENTS DECRY THE DENIAL OF THE DOUBLE 
VOTE AS A LOSS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR MINORITY RIGHTS, 
THESE CONCERNS ARE PROBABLY OVER-WROUGHT. 
 
6. BY AFFIRMING ONE-MAN, ONE-VOTE, NATIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES 
WILL HAVE MORE INCENTIVE TO BROADEN THEIR APPEAL TO ALL 
VOTERS REGARDLESS OF ETHNICITY, PROMOTING GREATER POLITICAL 
INCLUSIVENESS, ETHNIC TOLERANCE, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS -- 
AND THEY WILL HAVE MORE REASON TO FOCUS ON POCKET BOOK ISSUES.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) On November 6, Croatia\'s State Electoral Commission 
published the approved lists of candidates for the November 
23 parliamentary election.  This act serves as the official 
starting gun for the formal campaign, which means rules 
governing equal access to state media now apply.  Polls 
suggest that the parties which made up the Racan government 
are in trouble.  While the election will be very close, a 
coalition led by the right-wing HDZ may win enough seats to 
form a government.  End Summary. 
 
Five Thousand Candidates for 160 Seats 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Political parties and independent candidates had until 
midnight of November 3 to submit lists of candidates to 
Croatia\'s State Electoral Commission (SEC) in order to 
participate in upcoming elections.  After a 48-hour review 
period, the SEC released the names of more than 5,000 
candidates who will compete for seats in Croatia\'s next 
parliament.  Each list for the ten geographical electoral 
districts and the one \"diaspora\" list contained fourteen 
names.  While it is relatively easy to have a list approved 
by the SEC (in the central Zagreb district, voters will be 
confronted with 40 different lists), a list must receive at 
least five percent of the vote to qualify to divide the 14 
seats in an electoral district. 
 
SDP Helping Friends in Need 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The candidate lists reflect last-minute coalitions 
between the coalition-leading Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
and two smaller parties which had been faithful members of PM 
Racan\'s reform government.  Racan (as president of the SDP) 
ceded spots high on his party\'s list to members of the 
Liberal Party (LS) and the Libra party.  Igor Dragovan, 
Secretary General of the SDP, told us his party expected 
 
SIPDIS 
little return in terms of votes, but was taking the step in 
order to ensure that a \"liberal option\" was preserved as a 
parliamentary party in the next Sabor. 
 
HDZ Candidates Include Nationalist Dinosaurs... 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  (C) Croatia\'s two largest parties, the SDP and the 
right-wing nationalist HDZ followed through on pledges to 
shake up their parliamentary delegations.  Less than half of 
the MP\'s in their current parliamentary caucuses made the 
lists for this election.  HDZ President Sanader told the 
Ambassador the makeup of their list would demonstrate that 
the HDZ has become a modern, democratic party.  But in fact, 
while there are many new names, the HDZ has placed high on 
their lists individuals who epitomize the worst stereotypes 
of the Tudjman era abuses, including a suspected war criminal 
(Branimir Glavas), an active opponent of refugee return 
(Zadar Governor Sime Prtenjaca) and a kleptocrat (HDZ caucus 
whip Vladimir Seks). 
 
SDP Turns to WWF for Name Recognition 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) SDP leaders told us they planned to get rid of MP\'s 
who made insufficient substantive contributions to the work 
of the last parliament and to professionalize their caucus. 
But they placed Mirko Filipovic, a champion of the brutal 
sport called \"ultimate fight\" most popular in Japan (where he 
is known by the nom de guerre \"Cro-Cop\"), high on their list 
for the Zagreb city district.  Filipovic, who has no 
background in politics, may add name recognition to the SDP, 
but he will surely alienate the urban, educated voters which 
make up the core of the SDP. 
 
Polls Show HDZ Could Form Government 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) Because of differences in polling techniques (and 
levels of professionalism), opinion poll results in the 
Croatian press can vary by as much as 20 percent.  However, 
all show that the HDZ is holding its commanding lead as the 
largest individual party.  We met on November 7 with the 
directors of Croatia\'s most reliable polling firm.  They said 
that the HDZ continues to poll at 28 percent, with the SDP 
and its election partners trailing far behind at 19 percent. 
The HSS will continue to play the role of \"kingmaker\" and is 
polling at a solid 11 percent.  HNS is slipping, and now 
barely polls at eight percent. 
 
7.  (C) The percentage of voters who say they intend to vote 
but are still undecided is now only 12 percent; this figure 
continues to shrink as the date for elections approaches. 
IRI pollsters told us that a low turnout would favor the HDZ; 
with turnout now predicted at only 65 percent, the SDP and 
its partners need to work harder to get out the vote.  As it 
stands now, if the other right-wing parties which would be 
likely coalition partners for the HDZ (including the extreme 
nationalist Croatian Party of Rights - HSP) continue to hold 
their ground, the HDZ could win enough seats in parliament to 
form a coalition government with a slim majority. 
 
Coalition Parties Holding on to Hope 
------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) The parties which formed the Racan government have 
not given up hope.  HNS Secretary General Boris Blazejkovic 
told us that his party\'s polling numbers are infuriatingly 
variable, since they rely on the urban youth vote which is 
least likely to turn out for elections.  SDP leaders admit 
that this will be a tight race, but express confidence that 
Croatian voters will remember the dreadful state of the 
country\'s economy when the SDP-led government took office 
three years ago. 
 
Electoral Process Efficient, Transparent 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) Despite the closeness of the race, all of its 
contestants seem to be playing by the rules.  All of the 
election deadlines have been met, and OSCE\'s long-term 
observers are being granted access to all levels of the 
process.  Croatia\'s SEC allows NGO monitors to attend all of 
its sessions and publishes all decisions immediately on a 
modern website.  The Croatian Helsinki Commission (tasked by 
OSCE to conduct media monitoring) reported to the press on 
November 5 that the campaign has been portrayed by the media 
in a \"fair and balanced\" manner.

SUBJECT: CROATIAN ELECTIONS: GOOD TIME TO STAY ON SIDELINES 
 
Classified By: Nicholas Hill, Polecon Counselor, for Reasons 1.5 (B) an 
d (D) 
 
 
1.   (C) Summary: Elections are less than two weeks away and 
remain too close to call.  Both sides have complained that 
the U.S. favors the other side.  In contrast to 2000, when 
post played a rather prominent role shepherding the cats that 
made up Croatia\'s democratic opposition parties into 
something like a workable coalition, we have remained more 
publicly neutral this time.  If we favor any side it would be 
the ruling coalition under Prime Minister Racan\'s Social 
Democratic Party -- but, unlike in 2000, what the current 
election season is putting on display is a range of parties 
with many shades of gray.  HDZ has come a long way since 
Tudjman times, but it is not fully reformed.  SDP has moved 
Croatia in the right direction -- toward regional 
reconciliation and Euro-Atlantic institutions -- but it has 
been a big disappointment when juxtaposed against 
expectations at the beginning of its mandate.  End summary. 
 
2.   (C) There is a range of issues we will be looking to the 
next government to manage -- cooperation with the War Crimes 
Tribunal, facilitation of refugee returns, and regional 
reconciliation are key issues that Croatia faces as part of 
overcoming its wartime legacy.  Euro-Atlantic integration and 
implementing the wrenching reforms required of any transition 
country will also continue to figure prominently.  HDZ 
President Ivo Sanader argues to us that a government he heads 
will be much more friendly to the U.S. and sensitive to our 
priorities in the bilateral relationship.  His likely foreign 
minister, Miomir Zuzul, Croatia\'s Ambassador in Washington 
during the Tudjman era, is even more aggressive in making the 
case.  We like some of the rhetoric coming out of HDZ these 
days compared to the bad old days under Tudjman, but remain 
skeptical about follow through. 
 
Overcoming Wartime Legacy 
------------------------- 
 
3.   (C) Sanader knows what priority we attach to Croatia\'s 
cooperating fully with the War Crimes Tribunal and in private 
meetings assures us he has no intention to slack off compared 
to the current coalition.  Quite the contrary, he argues that 
an HDZ-led government will be \"much more efficient\" in 
working with The Hague.  This is a comparison that does not 
offer much reassurance given the current government\'s rather 
indifferent record of cooperation.  Moreover, Sanader\'s party 
has several key people who have rather cozy ties to potential 
war criminals.  Indeed, near the top of its list in Osijek is 
Branimir Glavas, an HDZ leader in the early nineties who 
played a considerable role in stirring up ethnic tensions -- 
and who many believe belongs in the The Hague himself.  Among 
his potential coalition partners, Sanader will have Drazen 
Budisa, leader of the Croatian Liberal Party (HSLS).  He has 
demanded that Croatia must change its terms of Cooperation 
with ICTY.  A former coalition partner of Racan\'s, he has 
demonstrated already that his threats can be more than 
bluster. 
 
4.   (C) Another priority for the U.S. in its relations with 
Croatia is seeing progress on refugee returns.  The current 
government has taken criticism for not doing enough to 
facilitate the return of ethnic Serbs expelled in the 
mid-nineties.  OSCE and UNHCR have led the way in pointing 
out the Racan government\'s deficiencies on this front and 
pointed to the lack of follow through.  Statements of intent 
are made in Zagreb about what will be done to facilitate 
returns and then little happens at the local level.  Sanader 
has told us he understands the importance of facilitating 
returns -- but we have seen precious little in terms of an 
HDZ strategy for pushing this issue forward.  (Although at 
Sanader\'s instruction when trying to set up a lunch meeting 
with the Ambassador, HDZ did forward to us a copy of a speech 
by Glavas underscoring the importance of inter-ethnic 
reconciliation.  We cannot confirm if the speech was actually 
delivered.) 
 
5.   (C) Another priority for the U.S. is seeing Croatia 
improve its relations with its neighbors.  On this issue on 
balance the current government has done well -- and is less 
vulnerable to an argument that HDZ could do better to advance 
our agenda.  Indeed, one of the first things the Racan 
government did on coming to office was to stop undermining 
Dayton by meddling unconstructively in BiH\'s Bosnian-Croat 
community.  Many outstanding issues remain, including 
ratifying the Ploce Port Agreement, but most observers agree 
that relations are much more normal than during Tudjman 
times.  Similarly, relations with Belgrade are much better. 
The two sides are moving constructively on a number of 
fronts, including by signing a landmark temporary agreement 
over the Prevlaka peninsula, which enabled the UN to shut 
down its observer mission there at the end of 2002.  Given 
all the bad blood, it is implausible that HDZ could step in 
and push regional reconciliation more effectively. 
 
Euro-Atlantic Integration 
------------------------- 
 
6.   (C) We support Croatia\'s integration into NATO and the 
EU, and have applauded the Racan government for pushing this 
process forward -- although it is not clear that continued 
progress hinges on the results of next week\'s elections. 
Certainly much has been done in the past four years.  The 
Prime Minister, particularly in recent months, has made EU 
integration the centerpiece of its mandate.  Quite 
constructively, the government has made clear that difficult 
decisions on ICTY cooperation and a range of reform issues 
will have to be made as part of this effort to move toward EU 
membership.  The government signed a Stability and 
Association Agreement with the European Commission in January 
2002 and has been working with the EC on membership 
requirements ever since. 
 
7.   (C) The problem is that the difficult decisions that 
Racan has been willing to talk about are not getting resolved 
and Croatia -- read, this government -- is only now starting 
to pay the price.  The SAA is bogged down.  If the British 
and Dutch do not ratify it by year-end -- their chief gripe 
is over the government\'s inability to track down Ante 
Gotovina, at present Croatia\'s only known ICTY indictee -- 
the EU\'s ten new members will enter in May and be asked to 
ratify it too.  As a result of the delays, the notion that, 
to get into Europe, Croatia needs Racan is looking less 
convincing all the time.  And for his part, Sanader and 
others in leadership positions in HDZ have been making some 
of the right noises about Euro-Atlantic integration.  The HDZ 
leader may be in a position to pull off a Nixon-to-China: it 
is doubtful that he would let problems concerning refugee 
returns or the War Crimes Tribunal derail Croatia\'s progress 
on EU integration. 
 
8.   (C) Sanader and Zuzul argue that they will work hard to 
keep EU integration on track and work even harder than the 
current government on NATO integration.  The jury is out for 
a while, but their case has some resonance.  Racan has 
benefited from the goodwill shown him ever since he came to 
office.  Sanader will benefit from no such goodwill, and 
bromides will not pass for policy measures.  He will have to 
bend over backward to answer the concerns about whatever 
coalition he forges, and deliver on substance not rhetoric. 
If he comes to power, whatever he does, there are plenty of 
skeptics in EU capitals and Croatia will inevitably lose time 
on moving toward the EU and NATO -- Sanader\'s task will be to 
move quickly to put the doubters at ease.  We are not 
convinced yet that he will succeed, particularly given some 
of the problematic, retrograde people associated with any 
HDZ-led coalition.  But it would also be unfair to suggest 
that an HDZ victory would automatically poison Croatia\'s EU 
and NATO chances -- particularly if substance replaces style. 
 
 
Conclusion 
---------- 
 
9.   (C) In part because the choices in Croatia\'s political 
orbit are so uninspiring, we are more ambivalent and have 
played a less active role in these elections compared to four 
years ago.  The current government has the right instincts 
about what needs to be done, but not the stomach to carry 
through on the implementation.  It has also been lamentably 
unresponsive on some of our own priorities -- in particular, 
its policy concerning Iraq during the lead up to war was 
confusing and unhelpful; it pandered needlessly to its old 
World War II allies Germany and France.  At the same time, 
after only four years out of power, HDZ has baggage and its 
return to power will leave many uncomfortable about the 
future.  We suspect that an HDZ-led coalition would look less 
like Tudjman revisited and more like Viktor Orban\'s coalition 
in Hungary until last year -- nationalist and somewhat 
roguish, with a lot of kleptocrats taking prominent 
positions, but not necessarily a malignant force for 
instability.  All in all, this is a good time to stay on the 
sidelines.

REFERENCED BANK ACCOUNT AT PRIVREDNA BANK HAD BEEN LOCATED. 
THE ACCOUNT, UNDER THE NAME OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF IRAQ, HAS 
APPARENTLY BEEN FROZEN SINCE 1991 UNDER UNSCR 661.  IN 
RESPONSE TO OUR REQUEST AND UNSCR 1483, THE GOC IS REQUESTING 
THAT A JUDGE ORDER PRIVREDNA BANKA TO TRANSFER THE MONEY TO 
THE DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR IRAQ.  THIS SHOULD OCCUR NEXT WEEK, 
AND OUR CONTACTS DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY PROBLEMS. 
 
2.  (SBU) WHILE WE WELCOMED THIS NEWS, WE QUESTIONED WHY THE 
ACCOUNT HAD NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED DURING THE INITIAL SEARCH FOR 
IRAQI ASSETS, REFTEL B.  OUR FIU CONTACT WAS UNSURE, BUT SAID 
THAT THE ACCOUNT HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED INTERNALLY AND PLACED 
IN A SPECIAL STATUS BY THE BANK AFTER ITS 1991 SEIZING, AND 
MAY THEREFORE HAVE BEEN MISSED. 
 
3.  (SBU) POST NOTES THAT UNSCR 1463, PARA 23 (A) ONLY MAKES 
A GENERAL REFERENCE TO GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ ENTITIES, WHILE 
PARA 23 (B) LISTS SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS.  ACCORDING TO THE

APPEARS THAT THIS LIST OF IRAQI STATE ENTITIES WAS NEVER 
POSTED.  WHILE THE CENTRAL BANK OF IRAQ OBVIOUSLY QUALIFIES 
AS A STATE ENTITY UNDER UNSCR 1483\'S PARA 23 (A), OTHER 
    ENTITIES MAY NOT BE AS OBVIOUS.  THE VARIOUS BANKS IN CROATIA 
MAY ALSO HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE LIST OF NAMES PROVIDED BY

TO IRAQI STATE ENTITIES.  TO ENSURE THAT ALL IRAQI ASSETS ARE

STATE ENTITIES, WERE ISSUED BY THE UNSCR COMMITTEE.  WE WOULD 
THEN ASK THE GOC TO CONDUCT A SECOND, MORE THOROUGH, SEARCH.

HIS CORE PARTY MEMBERSHIP.  ORGANIZED LABOR -- THE NATURAL 
CONSTITUENCY OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS -- IS BITTER ABOUT 
RECENT REFORMS OF LABOR LEGISLATION AIMED AT IMPROVING THE 
FLEXIBILITY OF CROATIA\'S LABOR MARKET, AND CROATIA\'S UNIONS 
HAVE REFUSED TO OFFER AN ENDORSEMENT TO ANY POLITICAL PARTY. 
NEVERTHELESS, LINIC WAS NOT WITHOUT SOME HOPE; HE BELIEVED 
THAT CROATIA\'S UNDECIDED VOTERS WOULD REMEMBER THE ECONOMIC 
DISASTER WHICH THE RACAN GOVERNMENT INHERITED FROM THE HDZ.

THE NATIONAL LEVEL.  KAJIN MADE A POINT OF TELLING US THAT IF 
IDS IS IN GOVERNMENT, IT WOULD VOTE TO SUPPORT A GOVERNMENT 
PROPOSAL TO DEPLOY CROATIAN TROOPS TO IRAQ.  IF SANADER WINS,

REF: ZAGREB 977 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU)  Prime Minister Racan\'s SDP may have gotten itself 
into a no-win situation by directly responding to what has 
been increasingly partisan -- and pro-HDZ -- comments made by 
Catholic Church officials in the run up to Croatia\'s national 
elections on November 23.  The Catholic Bishops Conference 
(HBK) released a pre-electoral message that was non-partisan 
at face value, but clearly conservative and supportive of the 
opposition parties.  Direct criticism of the Church would 
spell certain electoral death in a country that is over 85 
percent Catholic and still mired in issues of identity and 
ethnic nationalism.  The SDP at first chose not to respond 
but, as Church officials more publicly have crossed the line 
into partisan politics, some leading SDP members are finding 
it increasingly difficult to remain silent.   End Summary. 
 
Catholic Church Issues Election Message 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Catholic Church in Croatia entered the current 
electoral contest on October 30 when the Croatian Catholic 
Bishops\' Conference (HBK) released a statement that provided 
criteria for the faithful to evaluate parties and candidates. 
 The statement called on Church officials not to promote 
individual political parties; however, indications of support 
for conservative and right-wing parties were clear to all. 
Mentioned first was that parties must possess an 
\"uncompromising and consistent war on drugs,\" which 
represented a direct rebuff to the ruling SDP, which 
supported decriminalization of \"soft\" drug possession. 
 
3. (SBU) Catholics were also directed not to vote for parties 
and individuals who support legalized abortion, euthanasia, 
and same-sex marriages.  The Croatian People\'s Party (HNS) in 
particular, as well as other members of the ruling coalition, 
supported same-sex unions in the discussion on a recent law 
on gender equality.  Abortion is legal in Croatia, and only 
conservative parties on the right have openly opposed it. 
 
4. (SBU) Included among the list of priorities to be voted 
for were a \"removing of the legacy of the totalitarian 
system\" -- again, a swipe at the SDP as the successors to the 
Communist Party.  Voters were told to support those parties 
and candidates most likely to forge links between \"Croats at 
home and abroad,\" and those who will nurture national 
identity and culture.  The politics of identity and 
nationalism are clearly the domain of conservative and 
right-wing parties. 
 
5. (SBU) The issue of property restitution is further 
complicating the ruling coalition\'s relationship with the 
Catholic Church in the run up to elections.  On October 29, 
in a direct challenge to the Government, Archbishop Ivan 
Prendja of Zadar told reporters on the margins of the fall 
meeting of the Catholic Bishop\'s Conference that there has 
been little progress on restitution of church property 
nationalized after World War II.   At their annual spring 
meeting in April, the HBK made a similar statement claiming 
property restitution was at a standstill (Reftel).  It was 
also in April that the Catholic Church gave the Government a 
list of 43 properties for which it was seeking restitution. 
 
6. (SBU) On November 11, the media reported that the HBK sent 
the Government a letter requesting urgent restitution of 
properties.  Prime Minister Racan fell for the bait, and told 
reporters the pre-election period \"was not an ideal time\" to 
discuss restitution of Church property.  Two days later the 
HBK denied they had sent the GOC a letter, but used the 
denial to remind readers that the Government\'s commitments 
and obligations to the Church are \"well known.\" 
 
SDP No Longer Able to Turn the Other Cheek 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7. (SBU) Initially the SDP had been willing to ignore the 
various jabs and thrusts aimed at the ruling coalition; 
rather than respond defensively, members of the ruling 
coalition, as well as President Mesic, preferred instead to 
praise the Church for urging voters to go to the polls. 
Prime Minister Racan has praised the Church for getting out 
the vote, yet according to press reports, he also said he did 
not believe voters would be influenced by the Bishop\'s 
election message. 
 
8. (SBU) Ingrid Anticevic-Marinovic, Minister of Justice and 
a member of the SDP presidency, told us she has heard reports 
that reactionary priests have crossed the line and are now 
directly encouraging parishioners to vote against the ruling 
coalition.  We have heard similar reports, particularly in 
the ninth and tenth electoral districts that comprise most of 
Dalmatia, the strongholds of the HDZ and other more far-right 
segments of the opposition. 
 
9. (SBU) Boris Dezulovic, a columnist for the weekly \"Globus\" 
newsmagazine, summarized well what is being heard from the 
pulpit -- \"if you do not understand the bishop\'s advice on 
who to vote for, your parish priest will interpret for you: 
the HDZ.\"  On November 15, the press reported that Ante Ivas, 
Bishop of Sibenik, met with opposition candidates running in 
the Ninth Electoral District.  On November 16, Sime Lucin, 
Minister of the Interior and a member of the SDP presidency, 
held a press conference in which he confronted Bishop Ivas 
over his alleged support for the opposition. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) The SDP and other members of the ruling coalition 
have no real option but silence when it comes to responding 
to pre-election slights from the Church.  Criticism of the 
Church, and particularly criticism of Church involvement in 
partisan politics -- in a country where there is little 
separation of church and state -- would spell certain 
electoral death in a country that is over 85 percent Catholic 
and still mired in issues of identify and ethnic nationalism. 
 The best Racan could have hoped for would be silence from 
the Church, a prospect that now may be more difficult to 
achieve given senior party members\' new found willingness to 
confront Church officials.

SUBJECT: ELECTIONS: NEW POLLS SHOW RACE CLOSER THAN EVER 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) SEPARATE POLLS PUBLISHED IN CROATIA\'S TWO LEADING 
DAILY NEWSPAPERS ON NOVEMBER 17 INDICATE THAT THE RACE FOR 
CROATIA\'S NOVEMBER 23 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION WILL BE A PHOTO 
    FINISH.  ONE PAPER GIVES THE EDGE TO A RIGHT-OF-CENTER 
COALITION LED BY THE NATIONALIST HDZ AND THE OTHER SUGGESTS 
THAT A LEFT-OF CENTER COALITION LED BY PM RACAN\'S SDP IS 
AHEAD BY A NOSE.  BOTH POLLS SHOW THAT THE FATE OF SMALLER 
PARTIES WITHIN THE TWO GROUPINGS IS CHANGING.  THE MOST 
DRAMATIC CHANGE IS THE GAIN BY THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING HSP. 
WHILE THIS TREND IS NOTEWORTHY, IT PROBABLY DOES NOT 
REPRESENT A NATIONALIST SHIFT IN THE CROATIAN ELECTORATE, BUT 
THE DESERTION OF SOME OF THE HDZ\'S MOST EXTREME SUPPORTERS TO 
THE HSP.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) WITH LESS THAN A WEEK TO GO BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS, CROATIA\'S SENSATIONALIST PRESS IS FULL OF POLLING 
DATA, SOME OF WHICH HAS LITTLE MEANING.  ON NOVEMBER 17, 
ZAGREB\'S TWO LARGEST-CIRCULATION DAILIES PUBLISHED POLLS 
WHICH SUGGEST THIS ELECTION WILL BE THE CLOSEST IN CROATIAN 
HISTORY.  VECERNJI LIST COMMISSIONED A POLL THAT WAS 
CONDUCTED BY TELEPHONE FROM BETWEEN NOVEMBER 10-15 WITH 1800 
RESPONDENTS ACROSS CROATIA.  ONLY TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE POLLED 
SAID THEY INTENDED TO VOTE, AND ANOTHER SIX PERCENT SAID THEY 
HAD NOT YET MADE UP THEIR MIND IF THEY WOULD CAST THEIR 
BALLOTS.  THE POLL SHOWED THAT THE RIGHT-OF-CENTER BLOC LED 
BY THE CROATIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION (HDZ) WOULD WIN 71 SEATS, 
INCLUDING THE PROJECTED 5 OR 6 REPRESENTATIVES OR CITIZENS 
LIVING ABROAD.  THE LEFT-OF-CENTER GROUPING SEEN AS LIKELY BY 
VECERNJI LIST ANALYSTS, LED BY RACAN\'S SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY (SDP) BUT INCLUDING THE MORE CONSERVATIVE PEASANT PARTY 
(HSS), WOULD WIN 69 SEATS, INCLUDING THE 8 MINORITY VOTES 
THAT ARE LIKELY, BUT NOT CERTAIN TO BACK THIS MORE 
PROGRESSIVE OPTION. 
 
    3.  (C) WHILE THE TWO BIGGEST PARTIES -- THE HDZ AND THE SDP 
-- ARE HOLDING STEADY, THE HSS SEEMS TO BE LOSING GROUND; 
POLLS SUGGEST IT COULD WIN AS FEW AS EIGHT SEATS.  THE 
CENTER-RIGHT COALITION OF DEMOCRATIC CENTER (DC) AND THE 
CROATIAN SOCIAL LIBERAL PARTY (HSLS) -- A LIKELY PARTNER IN A 
GOVERNMENT LED BY THE HDZ -- IS LOSING GROUND AS WELL.  THE 
MORE LIBERAL CROATIAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (HNS), WHICH IS RUNNING 
IN COALITION WITH SMALLER REGIONAL PARTIES, COULD BE POISED 
TO SURPASS THE HSS TO BECOME THE THIRD STRONGEST POLITICAL 
PARTY IN THE NEXT PARLIAMENT WITH 15 SEATS. 
 
NEW HDZ WING OF AN HDZ COALITION? 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) BOTH POLLS SUGGESTED THAT THE EXTREME-RIGHT CROATIAN 
PARTY OF RIGHTS (HSP) WILL PERFORM FAR BETTER THAN ORIGINALLY 
EXPECTED.  FOR SOME VOTERS, THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE HDZ AND 
SDP IS NOT DISTINCT ENOUGH.  ON BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT, MOST 
OF THE CANDIDATES FOR SEATS IN CROATIA\'S NEXT PARLIAMENT ARE 
RUNNING CONVENTIONAL RACES, RELYING ON THE ADVICE OF MODERN 
MEDIA CONSULTANTS.  ON POLICY ISSUES, MOST CANDIDATES ARE 
TRYING TO STAKE OUT THE CENTER GROUND, SHOWING THEIR 
QUALIFICATIONS TO LEAD CROATIA TOWARD EURO-ATLANTIC 
INSTITUTIONS WHILE GROWING THE ECONOMY.  NOT SO THE HSP. 
WHILE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THE HSP FINALLY PROHIBITED THE 
DISPLAY OF WWII-ERA FASCIST SYMBOLS, IT RETAINS ITS EXTREME 
NATIONALIST CHARACTER. 
 
5.  (C) EMBLEMATIC OF THE HSP CAMPAIGN WAS THE STUNT PULLED 
BY LEADING ZAGREB HSP CANDIDATE SLAVEN LETICA.  TO KICK OFF 
HIS CAMPAIGN, HE RENTED A COSTUME OF THE 19TH CENTURY 
    CROATIAN VICEROY (AND WAR HERO) BAN JELACIC AND RODE ON 
HORSEBACK TO SVETA GERA, DISPUTED TERRITORY ON CROATIA\'S 
NORTHERN BORDER HELD BY SLOVENIA AND ASKED THE BORDER GUARDS 
TO LEAVE CROATIA.  ODDLY, THE MEMBER OF THE LAST SABOR VOTED 
AS \"BEST PARLIAMENTARIAN\" BY CROATIA\'S JOURNALISTS WAS HSP 
MEMBER TONCI TADIC.  WHILE JOURNALISTS RARELY AGREED WITH HIS 
VIEWS, THEY ALL RESPECTED HIS PROFESSIONALISM AND THOROUGH 
PREPARATION FOR FLOOR DEBATES. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C) AS THE HDZ\'S RHETORIC -- IF NOT ITS ACTIONS -- MOVES 
TOWARDS THE CENTER, ITS MORE RIGHT-WING ELEMENTS ARE FINDING 
A NEW HOME IN THE HSP.  THE HDZ IS NOT LOSING GROUND, 
HOWEVER, AND SEEMS TO BE ATTRACTING SUPPORTERS FROM SMALLER 
CONSERVATIVE PARTIES (LIKE THE HSS AND THE HSLS/DC) CLOSER TO 
WHAT PASSES FOR THE CENTER IN CROATIA.  THE INCREASE OF 
SUPPORT FOR THE HSP IS WORRISOME, BUT PROBABLY DOES NOT 
REPRESENT A NEW RISE IN EXTREME NATIONALISM IN CROATIA.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.   (C) Most international and local observers looking at 
preparations for elections in Croatia are generally satisfied 
that the voting on November 23 will be fair and transparent. 
ODIHR is comfortable enough with the process to have decided 
not to bring in short-term monitors for election day.  There 
has been criticism, however, of the GoC for foot-dragging on 
providing the means for ethnic Serbian refugees residing 
outside Croatia to vote.  Croatian authorities have felt the 
heat, including by the OSCE Head of Mission here, for not 
opening up more polling stations in Serbia to enable more 
refugee voting.  The Croatians have rejected proposals to 
open more polling stations -- pleading fiscal constraints and 
lack of interest in the affected refugee population.  End 
Summary. 
 
General Satisfaction, but... 
---------------------------- 
 
2.   (C) Most independent observers give Croatian authorities 
high marks for the preparations involved in making sure that 
elections set for November 23 are fair.  An ODIHR long-term 
observer mission in Croatia has convened a couple of meetings 
of the local diplomatic corps and gone over a laundry list of 
issues that would ordinarily be of concern, including 
election coverage in the media.  Officials are generally 
satisfied (see www.osce.org for more) and the OSCE decided 
after a September visit that election-day monitoring would 
not be necessary.  Similarly, GONG, the leading local NGO 
looking at election procedures, has expressed its 
satisfaction.  Where concerns have been raised and not 
answered by authorities have been over preparations to enable 
voting of ethnic Serb refugees outside of Croatia -- 
particularly in Serbia, where 90 percent of them reside. 
 
3.   (C) At the last ODIHR briefing of the diplomatic 
community on November 13, OSCE Head of Mission Peter Semneby 
went over efforts to get Croatian authorities to expand the 
number of voting stations in Serbia -- it was an issue that 
his mission and not ODIHR was taking the lead on.  Semneby 
told us that he and the EC Head of Mission had jointly raised 
their concerns with a number of people at the MFA and at the 
State Election Commission (SEC) on November 6.  The Head of 
the SEC Election Commission, Ivica Crnic -- who also chairs 
Croatia\'s Supreme Court -- had sent a letter to the MFA 
requesting that it consider adding more polling stations to 
facilitate easier voting by Serbian refugees, although 
Semneby conceded to us that the request in the letter had 
been fairly general.  Semneby recommended that authorities 
consider adding stations in northern Serbia in Sremska 
Mitrovica, Sombor, and Novi Sad. 
 
4.   (C) For its part, the MFA has resisted adding more 
stations in Serbia, and hidden behind the argument that any 
final determination would be the Election Commission\'s to 
make.  We have talked to the head of the Neighboring 
Countries Office, Davor Vidis, about the issue several times 
in recent weeks and received the same answer -- that the MFA 
would do whatever the Election Commission requested of it, 
but that so far no precise request had come in.  He told us 
that there would be polling stations at the Croatian Embassy 
in Belgrade, and consulates in Subotica, in Vojvodina, and 
Kotor, in Montenegro.  To the argument that many refugees are 
located over 100 kilometers from any of the planned station, 
he was dismissive: they can \"get in their cars and go vote.\" 
 
Too Costly? 
----------- 
 
5.  (C) On November 7, Semneby and the Head of the local EC 
Mission, Jacques Wunenberger, met with Deputy Foreign 
Minister Ivan Simonovic to push back.  They urged the GoC to 
make more effort to assist Serbian refugees, who constituted 
the \"most disadvantaged\" part of Croatia\'s electorate.  If 
the GoC would be willing to open more polling stations, the 
EC would be prepared to contribute 100,000 Euro to help get 
out the refugee vote.  (Nobody knows precisely, but there are 
over 200,000 refugees still living in Serbia, a good 
percentage of which would be eligible to vote.)  Simonovic 
resisted.  While he thanked the OSCE and EC for their efforts 
to get out the vote, the number of likely voters to turn out 
did not justify the resources required to open more polling 
stations.  In the last national elections in 2000, only 1,500 
people voted in Serbia, even fewer of those were refugees. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) Adding more polling stations in Serbia would not 
likely have affected the results of Croatian elections.  But 
 
 
the posture taken by authorities -- sometimes obfuscatory -- 
will invite criticism, and certainly rate a mention by ODIHR 
in what will otherwise be a fairly positive report of 
election procedures.  When we made this point with the acting 
head of the MFA\'s Americas Desk, she was dismissive: \"If it\'s 
not this issue, OSCE will find something else to complain 
about.\"  We heard all sorts of excuses why no polling 
stations would be added.  Primarily, the Croatians complained 
that adding more stations would just cost too much money. 
And at least until last week, Vidis said defensively, the 
Election Commission had not requested more stations.  When it 
finally did, the request was too vague -- and, more to the 
point, too late.  He did not say it, but under the election 
law, the deadline to add polling stations passed last week.

growth, declining unemployment, progress on its Stabilization 
and Association Agreement with the EU, new roads, and 
constructive relationships with the IMF and World Bank.  Even 
on the structural side, the government has made some major 
advances, such as in pension reform and downsizing of the 
police and military.  The main clouds on the horizon are 
burgeoning debt, both private and public.  Whether the 
progress was great enough and fast enough for the voters to 
give the government credit is in doubt.  Additionally, the 
Croatian public appears to share a characteristic with other 
central and eastern Europeans -- they perceive their 
situation to be significantly worse than the numbers would 
indicate.  End Summary 
 
Perils of Pauline with the IFIs 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) On November 12, the IMF completed a second review of 
its Stand-by Arrangement with Croatia.  While Croatia needed 
four waivers -- in part because the national oil company 
privatization receipts came in after the formal end of the 
review -- the IMF had a hard time arguing with 
greater-than-planned GDP growth (for the second year in a 
row), budgetary restraint, and strong foreign reserves.  Many 
observers had anticipated a train wreck on the current 
account deficit -- this year\'s big issue -- but, if the 
figures are to be believed, an enormously successful tourist 
season saved the Croatian government at the last hour.  (This 
is reminiscent of the situation last year, when the fiscal 
deficit was the major concern.  The government ended up 
confounding the IMF and most observers by outperforming that 
target as well by an almost inexplicable under-execution of 
the budget.) 
 
3.  (SBU) Another rabbit-out-of a-hat moment came when the 
government managed to pass a package of laws and amendments 
to fulfill conditions for the second tranche of its World 
Bank Structural Adjustment Loan.  The World Bank showed 
repeated flexibility, including delaying the \"drop-dead\" 
deadline of the review.  This approach paid off, since the 
government secured reforms to the labor laws considered 
impossible by many -- albeit while alienating its allies in 
the labor unions in the process.  The parliament also passed 
legislation on bankruptcy, budget preparation, corporate 
governance and competition.  Between these achievements and 
the laws the government has scrambled to pass to fulfill 
requirements of the EU, Croatia has made great progress on 
its legislative framework.  Implementation and enforcement 
will continue to be sticking points. 
 
Despite Everything, Quite a bit of Success 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) This phenomenon -- outperforming economically almost 
despite itself -- has been characteristic of this government. 
 Despite a woeful lack of economic talent, especially at the 
Ministries of Finance and Economy, the economy is on an 
upward, if shaky, path.  Much of the credit goes to prudent 
management at the Central Bank and lack of alternative 
investment opportunities in Western Europe, but also the 
prudent decisions of the previous and current governments to 
privatize the banking sector, most of the national 
telecommunications company, and a large chunk of the oil 
company, as well as the decision of this government to pursue 
restrictive agreements with the IMF and World Bank.  The 
efforts of numerous small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, 
while hard to quantify, appear to be playing an increasingly 
important part in the economic recovery. 
 
5.  (SBU) The banking crisis of the late Tudjman regime and 
the resultant recession forced the Socialist (SDP)-led 
government to move ahead on reforms that it might otherwise 
have avoided.  Whatever the motivation, the government can 
point to the strongest GDP growth in the region -- 5.2 
percent last year, 3.8 percent in 2001, and 3.9 percent in 
the first year of its mandate, 2000.  Projections for this 
year range from a low of 3.5 percent up to five percent -- 
with the final result likely to be closer to the higher 
number.  Inflation has been lower even than expected, less 
than two percent this year, and 2.2 percent last year. 
Foreign Direct Investment has fluctuated with several large 
deals, but, despite being well below potential, it has put 
Croatia in the middle of the Central and Eastern European 
pack in per capita terms.  The fiscal deficit remains too 
high, but decreased from 6.5 and 6.8 percent of GDP in 2000 
 
 
and 2001 respectively, to 4.8 percent in 2002 and is expected 
to come in close to the planned 4.6 percent this year.  The 
government has ambitious plans to cut the deficit to 3.8 
percent in 2004 -- a goal they have perhaps wisely not made 
public. 
 
6.  (U) Unemployment, in many ways the bottom line, has begun 
to move downwards.  After reaching a high of 16.1 percent in 
2000 (ILO-survey), it fell to 14.1 for the first half of this 
year -- still above the 13.6 percent of the HDZ\'s final year. 
 
7.  (SBU) Of course, this rapid growth has been accompanied 
by some economic imbalances, which if not addressed, could 
lead to or worsen the next recession.  Much of this 
impressive growth was fueled by government investment, 
principally in roads, and frantic consumer (and business) 
spending.  While industrial production has been increasing 
steadily, much of this spending is on imports.  This led to 
an eye-popping increase in the current account deficit, from 
3.7 percent of GDP in 2001 to 7.2 in 2003.  While the IMF had 
hoped to drive this down to 3.6 in the current year, it had 
to adjust its goal to 5.9 after the first review of the 
Standby Arrangement, and even then feared the goal would be 
missed. 
 
8.  (C) In a suspiciously dramatic escape, as-yet unpublished 
data showed that tourism inflows for the first nine months of 
this year were 89 percent (yes, eighty nine) above last year, 
thus allowing the GOC to make the revised current account 
deficit goal.  While the IMF is understandably skeptical, it 
has not been able to poke holes in the numbers.  The local 
IMF rep told us that the best indication that the data, if 
not actually accurate, at least are not an out-and-out lie, 
is that the Central Bank also refused to believe the numbers 
at first, until it found it could not refute them. 
 
Curbing Credit Growth 
--------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Perhaps more sustainably, measures that the Central 
Bank took to slow down the growth of credit and debt have 
begun to take hold.  The annual rate of credit expansion fell 
from 31.3 percent at the end of 2002 to below 20 percent, and 
is still falling, much to the distress of the banks and 
businesses. 
 
10.  (C) Debt has become the latest target of concern among 
the financial press and critics of the government, including 
the Central Bank.  Total external debt, both public and 
private has soared from 59.7 percent of GDP in 2000 to 68.5 
percent in 2002.  The Central Bank, resisting efforts from 
the IMF to tighten monetary policy further for fear of being 
blamed for a recession, has argued that government spending 
and guarantees to public companies are the main culprits of 
the expanding debt -- an argument that may be overblown. 
Public debt increased more moderately from 51.1 percent of 
GDP in 2000 to 51.6 in 2002.  Given the size of the current 
account deficit, the IMF and others want to squeeze both the 
increase in imports by slowing credit growth (through 
monetary policy) and government spending.  The government is 
also being pushed to finance more of its needs on the 
domestic market.  A properly functioning Ministry of Finance 
would certainly help in this area. 
 
11.  (C) While the official numbers for public debt do not 
look overly alarming, the GOC did breach its agreement with 
the IMF not to issue more guarantees than it retired.  Most 
of the new guarantees were for a railroad improvement 
project, which in its current, ambitious form, is met with 
skepticism by both the World Bank and the IMF.  The 
government plans to pay for future hefty investments in 
railroads with cuts in other spending, including social 
transfers and subsidies. 
 
Privatization Mixed 
------------------- 
 
12.  (SBU) On privatization, the picture is also mixed.  The 
state telecommunications company is majority-private, due to 
a process started by the previous government.  The current 
government pushed though a very successful sale of 25 percent 
plus one share of the state oil company, with a further 15 
percent to be privatized next year.  As mentioned earlier, 
the banking sector is largely in foreign, private hands.  The 
government is scaling back and pushing back the sale of parts 
of the state electricity company, specifying that now only 
distribution will be privatized.  The sale of the state 
insurance company can be considered a failure, as the GOC 
negotiates with the Catholic Church to take 25 percent of the 
company as compensation for post-WWII expropriations, and 
proposes the sale of an additional 20 percent through the 
stock exchange.  However, private insurance companies 
 
 
continue to expand their market share. 
 
13.  (C) The Croatian Privatization Fund handles the large 
state portfolio of smaller properties, mainly tourist and 
industrial properties.  After a politically motivated 
brouhaha over the sale of a resort complex on the island of 
Hvar early this year, no sales of companies have been 
finalized.  However, tender preparations continue, 35 
entities were tendered, and contracts are being negotiated 
for 12 of these.  Also in the past year, the government 
divested itself of minority shares in various companies 
valued at approximately $40 million.  While both the right 
and the left are shying away from discussing privatization 
during the campaign, both the right-of-center HDZ and 
left-of-center SDP seem to recognize the necessity of 
off-loading money losing enterprises.  However, the Croatian 
Peasant\'s Party, which brought the current privatization 
process to a near halt and whose support is very likely 
needed to form the next coalition, takes the most stridently 
anti-privatization line and could continue to play an 
obstructionist role in the next government. 
 
No Respect 
---------- 
 
14.  (SBU) Despite the government\'s significant successes, 
and despite porky \"goodies\" such as roads and subsidies to 
struggling industries, most notably in the shipbuilding and 
ship repair industries, the public appears unappreciative. 
While rates of poverty are relatively low -- 5 to 10 percent 
depending on the measure, in line with Slovenia and the Czech 
Republic -- over half the public, according to one poll, say 
they are barely making ends meet and need to take out loans. 
Another poll shows that, despite evidence to the contrary, 58 
percent of respondents thought that unemployment was 
increasing.  32 percent thought economic growth was negative, 
and 37 percent thought it was unchanged.  A dismal 51 percent 
thought their living standards had deteriorated since the 
ruling coalition came to power, only 14 percent thought 
living standards had improved. 
 
15.  (C) While this exaggerated pessimism appears to be a 
characteristic of the region, it may be magnified in Croatia 
because of the fractious nature of the coalition, the 
legacies of the war, and discrepancies in growth between 
Zagreb and the coast on one hand, and the rest of the country 
on the other.  It is a distinct possibility that this 
pessimism will translate into a vote against the current 
government, in order to punish it for sins real and imagined.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Voters head to the polls this Sunday, November 23, in 
what will probably be the closest general election in 
Croatia\'s short history.  The only result we\'re ready to 
predict is that the overwhelming majority of voters will cast 
ballots for candidates who back integration into 
Euro-Atlantic institutions and favor continued economic 
reform.  But regardless of whether the right or left wins, 
the next government will be a coalition which will include 
parties which do not fully share that consensus.  That means 
that Croatia\'s next government -- no matter how positive its 
intentions -- could have many of the characteristics we found 
most exasperating in its predecessor.  All expectations are 
that the poll will be carried out properly and that 
preliminary, unofficial results should be available by the 
end of election day.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) In Croatia\'s last general election nearly four years 
ago, voters were faced with clear choices: isolation or 
Europe, stagnation or reform.  When they return to the polls 
this Sunday, their options -- as they have been presented -- 
are far less distinct.  Both PM Racan\'s SDP and Ivo Sanader\'s 
HDZ have pledged to continue to lead Croatia toward 
integration in the EU and NATO, even if it means making 
unpopular choices, like cooperation with ICTY and 
accommodating the return of Serb refugees.  Both claim that 
they will continue to move forward with economic reforms, 
although both will probably have to step back from a few 
populist campaign promises. 
 
3.  (C) Perhaps the most important achievement of the past 
three years is the emergence of this solid consensus among 
the majority of voters as to where Croatia should be going. 
No matter what the outcome, our initial post-election 
response should be to welcome voters\' affirmation of 
Croatia\'s European vocation -- and all the reforms that 
entails -- and to encourage the next government to make 
faster progress toward this goal. 
 
4.  (C) Observers here continue to predict that this election 
will be the closest in Croatia\'s short history.  But it is 
clear that neither the HDZ nor the SDP will win enough seats 
to form a government on its own.  That means they will have 
to reach out to parties which do not fully share this 
mainstream, pro-Europe, pro-reform consensus.  There are also 
serious questions about whether the HDZ\'s commitment to this 
consensus is anything more than a respectable facade 
concealing the nationalist, corrupt elements still strong in 
Sanader\'s HDZ.  Certainly, the HDZ leadership has significant 
reservations about full cooperation with the ICTY. 
 
5.  (C) All polls indicate that the HDZ will be the single 
largest party in the next parliament.  To assemble the 
additional votes needed for a center-right government to come 
to power, Sanader will look first to the HSLS/DC as a 
coalition partner.  While the leaders of this coalition have 
made pro-Europe noises, HSLS leaders have made it clear that 
unconditional cooperation with The Hague War Crimes Tribunal 
is a price they are not willing to pay to get to Europe.  If 
Sanader needs to reach beyond the HSLS/DC, he will have to 
engage with the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), an extreme 
right-wing party which still carries historical baggage from 
Croatia\'s WWII-era fascist state. 
 
6.  (C) For a center-left government to return to power, 
Racan\'s SDP can rely on the progressive Croatian People\'s 
Party (HNS) as a solid partner which shares the mainstream 
consensus.  They should also be able to count on the support 
of most of the eight parliamentary seats which by law are 
allotted to Croatia\'s many ethnic minorities.  But even in 
their most optimistic election scenarios, this grouping will 
need help from the Croatian Peasants\' Party (HSS).  While the 
HSS shares the goal of membership in the EU, its leadership 
claims it will oppose some economic reforms (like 
privatization) and are arguing for a stronger state role in 
directing the economy. 
 
7.  (C) In January of 2000, the coalition led by Racan\'s SDP 
came to power with only a single shared goal: get rid of 
Tudjman\'s HDZ.  Lack of consensus within that coalition often 
meant the Government was paralyzed and conflicted every time 
it faced a tough decision.  Unfortunately, the likely lack of 
consensus within either of the lineups expected to succeed 
after Sunday\'s poll will produce either an unstable 
government or -- more likely -- one that, like its 
predecessor, seems indecisive and misses key opportunities. 
The only formula that seemed to work for the previous 
Government was to move slowly, blame tough choices on 
external factors and logroll coalition partners which would 
otherwise block progress.  We should expect to see some of 
this behavior in the next government as well.  In practical 
 
terms, that means major policy changes will be difficult to 
achieve.  Issues that would require a two-thirds majority -- 
like deploying troops to Iraq -- will be a tough sell for any 
government. 
 
8.  (C) We expect at least preliminary results to be 
available late on election day, November 23.  Final results 
may not be published for a few days, but because the process 
of tabulating results in Croatia has in the past been so 
transparent, reliable results of parallel vote counts 
conducted by NGO\'s and party observers will likely be 
available by November 25. 
 
9.  (C) The next step after elections is up to President 
Mesic.  The leader of the party which gets the most votes is 
not automatically given first chance to form a coalition 
government.  Croatia\'s constitution grants the president a 
high degree of flexibility in identifying who should make the 
first attempt at forming a government.  Mesic will grant this 
mandate to the leader of whichever grouping convinces him 
that they have the votes in the new parliament to form a 
government.  That individual will then have thirty days to 
form a government and receive a vote of confidence in the new 
Sabor.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.   (C) On the last day of the campaign for the November 23 
parliamentary elections, there is no escaping campaign hoopla 
in Zagreb.  All of Croatia\'s political parties -- even those 
with no hope of crossing the five percent vote threshold 
needed to win seats -- are pulling out all the stops.  They 
are spending freely; according to one leading daily, more 
than USD 10 million will have been spent during the short 
campaign, more than five dollars per person expected to vote. 
 Election-related TV and radio ads dominate the airwaves; 
party campaign cars can be seen plying city streets blaring 
Croatian music and party doctrine; activists are handing out 
pamphlets on busy corners; and political rallies -- complete 
with party literature, food, music, and Croatian celebrity 
guest appearances -- take place every night in Zagreb\'s main 
square.  The parties are running full force in these last 
pre-election days, turning the Croatian capital into 
something of an election-obsessed three-ring circus.  In the 
last days of the campaign, PM Racan\'s SDP seems to have 
finally found a rhythm that works, but this will likely be 
too little, too late.  End summary. 
 
 
HDZ Campaign Dominates the Scene 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) As we approach the November 23 elections, many of the 
political parties are sponsoring concerts and political 
rallies in Zagreb\'s main Ban Jelacic Square as well as other 
locations around town, and increasing numbers of party 
activists wander the pedestrian-only streets, handing out 
campaign pamphlets with fervor.  Both the SDP and HDZ wound 
up their campaigns with competing rallies on November 20 
about ten blocks apart in downtown Zagreb.  Both events drew 
big crowds, but the SDP managed to land two of Croatia\'s 
hottest pop acts and out-drew the HDZ by a solid margin.  The 
HDZ crowd was older and veterans from Croatia\'s war of 
independence were prominent.  The SDP crowd was a mix of 
party faithful, curious voters and (overwhelmingly) younger 
Zagrebers waiting for the politicians to get off the stage 
and the rock \'n roll to start.  The Peasants Party (HSS) 
rally on November 19 in Zagreb had a similar format; an old, 
stodgy membership turned up for free beer and music only to 
have their hats blown off by a way-too-loud state-of-the-art 
sound system. 
 
Cult of Personality? 
-------------------- 
 
3.   (SBU) Sanader\'s image permeates the HDZ\'s political 
campaign; he seems confident that the personality cult he is 
developing -- along with the self-confident aura of the 
campaign -- will result in victory for his party.  In fact, 
in interviews and public statements, the HDZ increasingly has 
been behaving as if it has already won.  In this vein, 
Sanader continues to pull out all the stops, airing not only 
campaign ads (designed by a U.S. firm), but also snippets of 
an interview with Austrian Prime Minister Schusssel, 
professing to be Sanader\'s friend and singing HDZ\'s praises. 
In broadcasting this ad and other testimonials from a number 
of right-of-center European leaders, Sanader seeks to 
reassure voters who have doubts about whether an HDZ 
government will be able to bring Croatia closer to EU 
membership. 
 
4.   (SBU) Television ads, which until this past weekend had 
been seen mainly during prime time and mostly for HDZ, have 
in the final days of the campaign absolutely taken over the 
airwaves.  Often five or six campaign ads will air back to 
back -- sometimes with two HDZ ads among them -- and they can 
be seen at all hours of the day.  They range from the 
polished and professional to the humorous and clearly low 
budget.  Much as is the case with the billboards, the HDZ 
appears to have put the most money and effort into their ads, 
which depict Sanader walking through a variety of Croatian 
cities, speaking with and \"high five-ing\" various Croatians 
-- old, young, traditional, and hip -- and ending with him 
emerging from a crowd of people, the EU stars circling about 
the screen and then melding into the Croatian flag as the 
backdrop all blurs and the image focuses on Sanader himself 
and the HDZ campaign slogan, \"Get Croatia Moving.\"  The 
campaign has been well-oiled, although some say it is too 
slick. 
 
5.   (SBU) While conducted on a smaller scale compared to 
HDZ, HSS and HNS -- both until elections were called part of 
SDP\'s ruling coalition -- seem to be effectively appealing to 
their respective electorates, or at least are attempting to. 
This week, HSS President Tomcic took up a \"personalization\" 
strategy; increasingly HSS billboards have moved from the 
slightly bizarre tree-hugging man with the \"I love my land\" 
 
slogan, to one with Tomcic as the dominant image with the 
Croatian countryside backdrop and the slogan remaining.  The 
HNS on the other hand, has flaunted the new Zagreb-Split 
highway at every opportunity.  Their billboards all picture 
the party\'s two leaders in the foreground, with images of the 
highway and the EU and Croatian flags in the backdrop.  One 
HNS TV ad depicts a middle-aged man driving home on the 
highway, pulling up to his house -- complete with a gnome in 
the front yard -- and sighing with happiness.  The references 
to the highways are HNS\'s attempt to profit from the road 
construction that has gone on busily over the past three 
years. 
 
SDP: Retooling, but Out of Time 
------------------------------- 
 
6.   (C) Until the last week of the election campaign, the 
SDP effort campaign was floundering.  The party seemed to be 
behaving as if it had already lost the election, sending a 
confused, unclear message in which the government\'s successes 
were not highlighted.  But in the final week of the campaign, 
the SDP has adjusted its message, learning from the success 
of the personalized campaigns of other parties.  New posters, 
billboards and TV ads feature PM Racan -- looking very Prime 
Ministerial indeed -- prominently.  Racan scored well in a 
head-to-head debate with Sanader, but since that event 
competed with a soccer match in which Croatia beat Slovenia 
to qualify for the European Champions League, few voters 
noticed.  In the final days, the SDP developed a new slogan, 
and began asking voters not to choose between left or right, 
but forward or back.  SDP leaders tell us that momentum is 
swinging in their direction.  \"If we only had five more days, 
we would beat them soundly,\" Igor Dragovan, SDP\'s Secretary 
General told us on November 20. 
 
Smaller Parties 
--------------- 
 
7.   (U) The smaller parties and the plethora of independent 
candidates, none of whom has much chance of ending up in the 
next Parliament, seem -- somewhat inexplicably -- just as 
eager as the larger parties to get the word out.  Nearly all 
have been seen around Zagreb campaigning, most already have 
numerous billboards up and more go up everyday.  Many have 
begun airing short TV ads, and one even has a website devoted 
entirely to his campaign platform.  Candidates on these 
independent lists run the gambit from former SDP vice 
president Zdravko Tomac to the known arms dealer, Zvonko 
Zubak, to an idealistic Croatian-American businessman, whose 
billboards simply show him, his first name (Boris) in a giant 
red square, and proclaim \"Dobar Glas!\" -- a vote for Boris is 
a \"Good Vote.\" 
 
8.  (SBU) The OSCE/ODIHR assessment of the campaign continues 
to be positive.  Outside of a few isolated egg-throwing 
incidents, there has been no violence and voters are being 
given the information they need to make an informed decision. 
 Media coverage has been balanced, and although coverage has 
been skewed in favor of larger political parties, it is 
evenly split between the SDP and HDZ. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.   (C) This campaign season, with its focus on image and 
not substance seems to have left Croatia\'s voters and opinion 
leaders unsatisfied.  The HDZ\'s over-confidence seems to be 
turning off voters -- an impression that Racan is encouraging 
by consistently pointing to Sanader\'s \"arrogance\" during the 
campaign.  Despite their own lackluster efforts, one SDP 
advantage has been the fear factor; when all is said and 
done, some just tremble at the thought of Tudjman\'s old party 
returning to power.  They will vote SDP.  However, this could 
also swing the other way; with polls showing an advantage for 
HDZ, voters could decide to stay home on Sunday, driven to 
despair by HDZ\'s well-oiled campaign machine.  The good news 
is that all the punditry and speculation will come to an end 
on election day, and all the political jockeying and 
coalition building will get started.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Under Croatia\'s peculiar election law, Serbs are 
pulled in two different directions in the run up to voting. 
They can vote for candidates on the minority lists or for 
candidates on the national lists but not for both.  At a 
rally November 20, candidates of the moderate Independent 
Democratic Serb Party (SDSS) encouraged voters to vote for 
the ethnic lists.  Some say this makes no sense: the Serbs 
are guaranteed three seats in the next parliament no matter 
how few votes they get, so they should vote for the national 
parties most sensitive to their issues to ensure maximum 
influence.  Not so, says the SDSS.  Vote for them on the 
ethnic lists so SDSS members of parliament have the 
credibility of being backed by a large constituency.  They 
will then be better positioned to do the bidding of Croatia\'s 
Serbian community, and maybe even play the role of a 
kingmaker in an otherwise evenly divided legislature, with 
whatever coalition eventually emerges after elections.  End 
summary. 
 
Last Day of Campaigning 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) With one full day of campaigning remaining in the run 
up to parliamentary elections on November 23, we attended a 
Zagreb rally of the Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS). 
 Held in a small concert hall in the center of the city, 
better known for rock concerts, the rally drew a mostly 
middle-aged and elderly crowd of approximately 250.  A 
traditional Serbian band opened the rally, which was attended 
by current SDSS office holders from across the country, as 
well as the party\'s top three candidates:  Vojislav 
Stanomirovic, President of the SDSS, Milorad Pupovac, Vice 
President, and Ratko Gajica. 
 
3. (C) All three candidates repeated a now familiar theme of 
the SDSS campaign -- ethnic Serbs should vote for candidates 
on the ethnic Serb minority list.  To urge all Serbs to vote 
on the minority list, when they are guaranteed three seats 
regardless of the number of voters, would appear illogical on 
the surface, since by doing so the Serbian leadership is 
putting at risk the reelection of a center-left coalition, 
their natural allies.  At least three factors explain the 
logic.  First, although there are three seats guaranteed for 
Serbs, this election presents a real competition between 
Serbs.  Some observers predict the SDSS will win two seats 
and Milan Djukic, a more extreme populist -- based on name 
recognition alone -- will win one.  However, the SDSS dreams 
of winning all three seats, as well as one or two diaspora 
seats, which would make them a respectable small party in 
Parliament and a force to reckon with.  Though highly 
unlikely, an SDSS electoral sweep would require a significant 
increase in Serbs voting on the ethnic list. 
 
4. (C) Second, along with so many other segments of the SDP\'s 
electoral base, ethnic Serbs are angry and disillusioned by 
what they view as the ruling coalition\'s abject failure to 
resolve their issues.  They want a government of the left, 
but not a continuation of the current coalition, according to 
Pupovac.  He declared that the last three and a half years 
have been wasted, and Croatian Serbs need a courageous and 
decisive government that takes their votes more into account 
than the voters of the HDZ.  Pupovac said that Prime Minister 
Racan\'s much delayed call for Croatian Serbs to return was as 
convincing as when Tudjman told them not to leave. 
 
5. (SBU) Gajica told the small crowd that he was approached 
in Knin -- the center of the war-affected area near the 
Bosnian border, with a population now consisting entirely of 
either returned Serbs or settled Bosnian Croatians -- by a 
representative of the ruling coalition, who said \"since it 
only takes one vote each to get all three of your (Serb) 
members elected, give your votes to us.\"  Gajica\'s response, 
intended to roil his audience, was that \"they had our votes 
on a platter\" before, but failed to address in any meaningful 
way issues of direct concern to the Serbian community. 
Stressing the theme that Serbs will not be taken for granted 
any more prompted loud applause. 
 
6. (C) Finally, to affect the work of the Parliament, and to 
be a legitimate partner of the ruling coalition, Serbs 
elected to fill the minority seats need to be able to say 
they speak for the Serbian community.  We attended SDSS 
rallies both in Knin and in Zagreb earlier, and the message 
 
was identical -- if only 10,000 Serbs vote on the minority 
list, and 100,000 Serbs vote for the ruling coalition, then 
the Government will be able to claim rightly that they have 
the mandate to speak for the Serbs.  Gajica called such 
thinking \"dangerous,\" and urged Serbs to use their numbers to 
build an organization that is both strong and lasting. 
Gajica and Stanomirovic both have stated at rallies that they 
hope such ethnic politics will not be relevant in 20 years, 
but lament that it is a realistic necessity now in order for 
Serbs to get their issues addressed.  Pupovac privately has 
told us he would feel more comfortable within the folds of a 
\"civic\" social democratic party, but democracy in Croatia is 
not yet at the stage where there are issue-based political 
parties able to address minority issues adequately. 
 
Not mincing Words 
----------------- 
 
7. (U) Looking tired and somewhat edgy, Pupovac ventured into 
territory normally off limits to politicians.  It was 
\"offensive and humiliating\" for Serbs to be asked if they are 
\"full Croatians\" and loyal to Croatia.  He told the audience 
he personally hoped for a Croatia unencumbered, without 
disbelief, bad feelings, and mistrust.  Sounding much more 
like a psychologist than the professor of rhetoric that he 
is, Pupovac expressed hope for a Croatia that could have a 
\"relaxed relationship with itself.\"  He spoke of a country 
where all are treated equal, and each is valued. 
 
8. (U) A large part of Croatia was silenced, he continued, 
and the ruling coalition has not done its job to remove this 
suppression.  Speaking of all Croatians, he said people need 
self-confidence, and should believe more in themselves, 
rather than seek such confirmation elsewhere.  Addressing 
Serbs directly, he said, \"we certainly need to face certain 
truths, to ask why we are guilty too, either for omissions or 
for what others were doing on our behalf.\"  However, he 
spread the blame when he intoned that Serbs should be able to 
accept not just their guilt but also those things for which 
they are not guilty -- and he then listed Croatian cities in 
which war crimes were committed against Serbian civilians. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) From talking to ethnic Serbs, particularly their 
political leadership, and attending some of their rallies, it 
is clear that the Racan-led coalition has left many 
disenchanted.  They see less need to vote for what would be 
their logical coalition partners on the center-left -- even 
if it means nationalist parties benefit on election day. 
Indeed, some Croatian Serb leaders may hope that the group of 
eight minority seats in the next parliament becomes a 
potential king maker in an otherwise evenly divided 
legislature -- giving the minorities more clout to extract 
concessions, from either a Racan-led or a Sanader-led 
government.  A second reason why SDSS wants Croatian Serbs to 
vote for ethnic lists is more crass: the party cannot stand 
Milan Djukic, leader of the rival Serbian National Party 
(SNS).  The lower the turnout in the ethnic voting, the 
better Dukic will do.  In Croatia, as in the rest of the 
region, politics is personal.

WEAK COALITION IN NEW SABOR

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) founded by 
former President Franjo Tudjman was a big winner in Croatia\'s 
November 23 parliamentary election, but will still have to 
form a coalition in order to seat a government.  According to 
unofficial results, the HDZ won 65 of 76 seats needed for a 
majority.  But its likely coalition partners performed so 
poorly that HDZ President Ivo Sanader\'s government may have a 
parliamentary majority of only a handful of seats. 
 
2.  (U) Voter turnout was just over 68 percent, as expected. 
OSCE and local NGO monitors concluded that the poll was 
conducted in a professional and transparent manner with no 
incidents which would affect the outcome.  Results will be 
made official within ten days, once the period for candidates 
to appeal results has expired. 
 
3.  (SBU) The next step is for President Mesic to consult 
with political leaders and then decide who gets the first 
chance to form a government, based on that individual\'s 
ability to demonstrate to Mesic that he will be able to 
command a majority of seats in the new parliament.  Sanader 
expects to get the nod soon, but Mesic seems to be in no 
hurry.  The law sets no time limit for these consultations to 
be completed, but Mesic is expected to name a PM-Designate by 
the end of the week.  This individual would then be required 
to present a government to the new Parliament for a 
confidence vote within 30 days.  It is likely that the next 
Croatian cabinet will be seated before Christmas.  End 
Summary. 
 
HDZ Machine Campaign Delivers Results 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Voters went to the polls on November 23 to elect a 
successor to Croatia\'s first post-Tudjman parliament.  The 
\"official\" portion of the campaign was short, but very 
intense, and the powerful HDZ campaign machine made the most 
of the natural pessimism of Croatian voters, convincing them 
that -- most empirical evidence to the contrary -- they were 
not better off than when the Racan government came to office 
in January 2000. 
 
HDZ Exceeds Even Its Own Expectations ... 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) Sanader\'s HDZ won in eight of Croatia\'s ten 
geographical electoral districts and won big in the 
nationalist-leaning areas of Dalmatia and Eastern Slavonia 
which still feel the effects of war.  As expected, the HDZ 
was weakest in central Zagreb and in Istria, Croatia\'s most 
developed regions.  According to unofficial results, the HDZ 
won a total of 65 out of 151 seats in the new parliament. 
The number of seats assigned to representatives of voters 
outside of Croatia -- the \"diaspora district\" -- is 
determined by voter turnout.  The results of precincts in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina are still being tabulated; the result 
for the HDZ and the total number of seats in the new 
parliament may be increased by one. 
 
But Will Still Have Trouble Seating A Government 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6.  (C) Despite winning almost twice as many seats as his 
closest rival (Racan\'s SDP), Sanader will have to work hard 
to form a coalition with even a narrow majority.  His most 
likely coalition partners, a grouping of the Croatian Social 
Liberal Party (HSLS) and the Democratic Center (DC), were 
dealt a humiliating defeat by the voters, electing only three 
MP\'s.  Neither party president will enter the Sabor, which 
almost certainly means the end of their political careers. 
Sanader can count on the support of the extreme right-wing 
Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), which won eight seats 
(doubling its total from the previous parliament), but he 
would rather not be saddled with the HSP\'s ultra-nationalist 
baggage. 
 
HSS Is Down, But Not Out of the Horsetrading 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The Croatian Peasants\' Party (HSS) had expected to be 
a major player in the next parliament, but instead lost 
ground.  Analysts suggest that voters interpreted Party 
President Tomcic\'s coyness during the last days of the 
campaign about whether his party would go right or left as 
\"these seats for sale.\"  Rather than the 20 seats projected 
by reliable polls just two weeks before the election, the HSS 
secured only 10, down from 16 in the previous parliament. 
 
 
Nevertheless, the HSS could still try to bargain with the HDZ 
to enter government.  The HDZ would have to choose which 
partner, the HSP with its nationalist reputation or the HSS 
with its economic goals smacking of central planning, would 
be the lesser of two evils. 
 
Election Surprise -- Pensioners Win Three Seats 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8.  (C) As expected, Racan\'s SDP was the other big loser in 
Sunday\'s poll, but his party -- together with coalition 
partners -- will remain a significant force in the new 
parliament.  The Croatian People\'s Party (HNS), which had 
only two seats in the previous Sabor, made important gains 
and now has 11 seats.  The one surprise was the Croatian 
Party of Pensioners (HSU), which enters the parliament for 
the first time with three seats.  Croatia\'s pundits are still 
scratching their heads about the success of the HSU, but 
speculate that they benefited from the HSS\' loss. 
 
Thirteen Parties In Sabor Equals One Big Mess 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) When all the various coalition partners are counted 
separately, there will be a total of thirteen political 
parties represented in the next Croatian parliament.  Add to 
this cacophony an additional eight seats reserved for ethnic 
minorities (which in the last parliament almost always voted 
against the HDZ). 
 
Slim Majority May Force the HDZ to \"Play Nice\" 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
10.  (C) If the HSS decides not to align itself with the HDZ, 
Sanader will have a majority of only five seats in the new 
parliament.  This could be further eroded if the few seats 
from the HSLS/DC grouping decide to declare themselves as 
free agents (anything is possible).  On one hand, this may 
force Sanader to reach across the aisle to seek consensus 
before setting any new policy course.  But this slim majority 
will also mean that he will find it difficult to get the 
business of government done.  Because the SDP and HNS share 
the main policy goals which Sanader claimed the HDZ would 
pursue after elections, one might hope for non-partisan 
consensus on issues related to Croatia\'s integration into 
Euro-Atlantic institutions.  Unfortunately, as there is no 
love lost between the right and left in Croatia, the new 
opposition may look for opportunities to repay the HDZ\'s 
dirty parliamentary tricks which so often embarrassed the SDP 
during Racan\'s tenure. 
 
OSCE and NGO\'s Praise Election Process 
-------------------------------------- 
 
11.  (U) Long-term monitors from OSCE\'s Office of Democratic 
Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) cited a number of areas 
for improvement in Croatia\'s electoral legislation, but 
concluded that the conduct of the poll was professional, 
transparent and the result was the democratic expression of 
the voters.  As it did in 2000, the highly successful 
Croatian election watchdog NGO \"GONG\" mounted a full scale 
election monitoring effort with nearly 3000 participants. 
They reported a number of minor incidents, but concluded that 
the process was professional and in accordance with election 
law.  A parallel vote tabulation carried out by GONG 
confirmed the general results presented by Croatia\'s State 
Electoral Commission.  No political party has so far 
challenged any of the results in any of the polling stations 
in Croatia or abroad. 
 
Timelines: Mesic to Name PM-Designate 
------------------------------------- 
 
12.  (SBU) Now that the voting is over and reliable -- but 
not official -- results are available, Croatia\'s constitution 
calls for President Mesic to name a PM-designate, after 
consultations with the various political parties.  Mesic told 
the press that he would not necessarily name the PM-designate 
on November 24, but would seek evidence from the next 
potential prime minister of agreements with other political 
leaders which demonstrates that they would be able to win a 
vote of confidence.  Neither Croatia\'s constitution nor the 
election law specify the amount of time the President has to 
make his designation, but Mesic\'s political adviser told us 
the President would act before the end of the week.  Once a 
PM-Designate is named, he will have thirty days to present a 
cabinet to the parliament to pass a vote of confidence. 
 
Government In Place by Year\'s End 
--------------------------------- 
 
13.  (SBU) The results of the election will become official 
 
 
when the State Electoral Commission has received all of the 
signed originals of the protocols certifying results from all 
polling stations around the world and when all appeals of 
these results have been considered by Croatia\'s 
Constitutional Court.  Election officials tell us this should 
take about 10 days.  The new parliament must convene within 
20 days of \"completion of the election\" -- which is 
interpreted as publication of the official results.  Ideally, 
the first act of the new parliament should be to vote its 
confidence in the new government proposed by the 
PM-designate.  If Croatia\'s democratic process continues to 
function as efficiently as it has for this election cycle, a 
new Government could be in place before Croatia\'s public 
institutions begin to shut down for the Christmas and New 
Year holidays.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) MIOMIR ZUZUL, CERTAIN TO BE HDZ\'S NOMINEE AS 
CROATIA\'S NEXT FOREIGN MINISTER, TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON 
    NOVEMBER 24 THAT THE HDZ IS SEEKING TO FORM A COALITION WITH 
THE CROATIAN PEASANTS\' PARTY (HSS) AND THE ETHNIC SERB PARTY 
TO AVOID HAVING TO BRING THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING CROATIAN 
PARTY OF RIGHTS (HSP) INTO GOVERNMENT.  AN HDZ GOVERNMENT 
WOULD BE PREPARED TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT AND WOULD 
SUPPORT DEPLOYING CROATIAN TROOPS TO JOIN COALITION FORCES IN 
IRAQ.  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED THE HDZ ON ITS WIN AND 
COMMENDED VOTERS\' EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR INTEGRATION INTO 
EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS.  HE PRAISED THE HDZ\'S CAMPAIGN 
STATEMENTS ON MOVING FORWARD WITH WAR LEGACY ISSUES, 
INCLUDING ICTY.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE U.S. WOULD MAKE 
JUDGMENTS BASED ON THE NEW  GOVERNMENT\'S ACTIONS, NOT ITS 
STATEMENTS.  ZUZUL LOOKED FORWARD TO A SERIES OF REGULAR 
CONSULTATIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 24, THE AMBASSADOR PHONED HDZ PRESIDENT 
IVO SANADER TO CONGRATULATE HIM FOR HIS PARTY\'S STRONG 
SHOWING IN THE NOVEMBER 23 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  SANADER 
WAS QUICK TO RETURN THE CALL, AND ASKED THAT THE AMBASSADOR 
MEET RIGHT AWAY WITH MIOMIR ZUZUL, WHO WOULD BE THE HDZ\'S 
NOMINEE AS CROATIA\'S FOREIGN MINISTER.  THE AMBASSADOR 
AGREED, AND MET WITH ZUZUL ONE-ON-ONE ON THE EVENING OF 
NOVEMBER 24. 
 
3.  (C) ZUZUL WAS CLEARLY PLEASED WITH THE HDZ\'S RESULT, BUT 
WAS QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT THE HDZ IS STILL WORKING ON 
PUTTING TOGETHER A COALITION WITH ENOUGH VOTES TO SEAT A 
GOVERNMENT.  HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE HDZ\'S FIRST 
CHOICE IS TO GIVE THE HSS A CHANCE TO FORM A GOVERNMENT.  THE 
HDZ WOULD BE WILLING TO MAKE A GENEROUS OFFER TO THE HSS, 
ZUZUL EXPLAINED, IN ORDER TO FORM A GOVERNMENT WITHOUT THE 
    HSP.  (NOTE: ZUZUL KNOWS WELL THAT THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY WOULD BE HESITANT TO ENGAGE WITH THE NATIONALIST 
HSP.  END NOTE.)  DESPITE THE HSS\' POOR SHOWING IN THE POLLS, 
THE HDZ WOULD BE WILLING TO OFFER HSS PRESIDENT TOMCIC THE 
CHANCE TO RETURN AS SPEAKER OF CROATIA\'S PARLIAMENT (A POST 
HE HELD FOR THE DURATION OF THE RACAN GOVERNMENT).  FAILING 
THAT, THE HDZ WILL OFFER TOMCIC A SPOT AS DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER OR PERHAPS ONE OR MORE \"NON-KEY\" MINISTRIES IN THE 
NEXT GOVERNMENT. 
 
4.  (C) ZUZUL SAID THAT THE HDZ WOULD SEEK THE SUPPORT OF 
CROATIA\'S ETHNIC SERB PARTY, WHICH, THANKS TO CROATIA\'S 
PROGRESSIVE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES, 
NOW HAS THREE SEATS IN THE PARLIAMENT.  THE HDZ WOULD BE 
WILLING TO OFFER THE SDSS A POSITION AS DEPUTY SPEAKER, SAID 
ZUZUL, WHICH WOULD BE A STRONG SIGNAL OF THE SANADER 
GOVERNMENT\'S INTENTION TO MOVE FORWARD ON REFUGEE ISSUES. 
 
5.  (C) ZUZUL SAID THAT RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. WILL BE A 
PRIORITY FOR THE SANADER GOVERNMENT.  THE HDZ WOULD SUPPORT 
SIGNING AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT AND WOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH 
DEPLOYING A CROATIAN CONTINGENT OF TROOPS TO JOIN COALITION 
FORCES IN IRAQ.  ONCE THE COALITION IS LOCKED IN PLACE, BUT 
BEFORE THE FIRST MEETING OF THE PARLIAMENT, SANADER PLANS TO 
TRAVEL TO ROME (WHERE HE WOULD SEEK A MEETING WITH PM 
BERLUSCONI AND AN AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE) AND ALSO TO 
WASHINGTON TO DESCRIBE HIS NEW GOVERNMENT\'S PLANS.  ZUZUL 
SAID SANADER WOULD HOPE FOR A MEETING IN WASHINGTON WITH 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER DR. RICE. 
 
6.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED ZUZUL FOR HIS OPENNESS AND HIS 
    READINESS TO MEET WITH US ON A REGULAR BASIS; THE U.S. 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WITH CROATIA HAS BECOME MUCH MORE 
BROAD IN THE NEARLY FOUR YEARS SINCE THE HDZ WAS LAST IN 
GOVERNMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED THE HDZ ON ITS 
STRONG SHOWING IN THE POLLS AND POINTED OUT THAT ELECTION 
RESULTS SHOWED THAT VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY BACKED PARTIES 
WHICH SUPPORT CROATIA\'S INTEGRATION INTO EURO-ATLANTIC 
INSTITUTIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR URGED THE HDZ TO CAPITALIZE ON 
ITS STRONG MANDATE AND MOVE FORWARD ON THE TOUGHEST ISSUES, 
LIKE ICTY COOPERATION AND REFUGEE RETURN, EARLY IN ITS 
TENURE.  HE WELCOMED SANADER\'S PROGRESSIVE STATEMENTS DURING 
THE CAMPAIGN, BUT WARNED THAT THE USG WOULD MAKE JUDGMENTS 
BASED ONLY ON POLICY IMPLEMENTATION. 
 
7.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE EASIER TO 
ADVOCATE FOR SENIOR-LEVEL MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON ONCE SANADER 
HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN OFFICE AND HAD A POSITIVE TRACK RECORD.

Summary 
-------- 
 
1. (U) With the official vote count still days away, moderate 
Serbs from the Independent Democratic Serbian Party (SDSS) 
are almost certain to fill the three designated ethnic Serb 
seats in the next Parliament.  Milan Djukic, the 
confrontational former representative of ethnic Serbs in 
Parliament, lost narrowly to a relatively unknown newcomer on 
the national scene, and will not return to Parliament. 
Ethnic Serbs appear to have decided that extremist politics 
have not been successful, and the SDSS will face high 
expectations that they can solve intractable and long-term 
problems faced by the Serbian community.  End Summary. 
 
A Clean Sweep by the SDSS 
------------------------- 
 
2. (U) One of the surprises to come out of the November 23 
Parliamentary elections is that the Independent Democratic 
Serbian Party (SDSS) appears to have captured all three of 
the guaranteed seats for the Serbian minority in the next 
parliament.  With results in from all but six of 6,504 
polling stations (99.9 percent), the SDSS\'s candidates placed 
first, second, and third on the minority list.  Vojislav 
Stanimirovic, the party President, was first with 24,361 
votes (22.16 percent) and Milorad Pupovac, vice president of 
SDSS, came in second with 23,541 votes (21.41 percent).  The 
biggest upset of all was Ratko Gajica, the SDSS\'s third 
candidate and a relative unknown outside of Knin, who beat 
Milan Djukic, President of the Serbian National Party, by 
approximately 700 votes.  In the last Parliamentary election 
in January 2000, Djukic beat Pupovac by 3,000 votes and was 
the minority Serbian representative in the 2000-2003 
parliament, which had only one guaranteed minority seat 
reserved for Serbs. 
 
A Political Newcomer 
-------------------- 
 
3. (U) Gajica, whose birthday was election day, started the 
campaign as a relative unknown outside of Knin.  A lawyer by 
training, he is an SDSS representative in the Sibenik-Knin 
County Assembly, and the President of the Sibenik-Knin 
Serbian National Minority Council.  His prominence among 
Serbs in the Knin region may partly be due to the fact he 
stayed in Knin during and after Croatian forces recaptured 
the town in Operation \"Storm\" in 1995.  He maintained a 
private law practice, and has consistently provided pro bono 
legal assistance to ethnic Serbs.  Though never mentioned by 
name directly, in campaign appearances Gajica contrasted his 
calm and reasoned style, and ability to work successfully 
within the system, with that of Djukic.  Stanimirovic and 
Pupovac both worked to provide Gajica with maximum exposure 
among the electorate.  The three candidates appeared together 
at almost all campaign functions across Croatia, and Gajica 
was featured in press releases and campaign propaganda 
distributed in Serbia and Montenegro. 
 
Djukic Ousted 
------------- 
 
4. (C) Djukic, on the other hand, appears to have antagonized 
just about everyone.  An OSCE observer termed his performance 
on the campaign trail \"atrocious.\"  He campaigned almost 
exclusively on his home turf of Donji Lapac and Donji Srb. 
However, his rallies were poorly attended -- at times only a 
handful of people turned out.  Bombastic and exclusionary, 
Djukic\'s style is to make an extreme statement that will draw 
a reaction from a high-level Government official, often 
ensuring prominent press coverage.  Few if any legislative 
accomplishments could be credited to Djukic; he even voted 
against the dual vote for ethnic minorities (Ref B), a 
position seemingly at odds with a large majority of ethnic 
Serbs.  Drazen Djakula, the President of the non-partisan 
Serb Democratic Forum (SDF), told us after the election that 
Djukic\'s ouster from parliament indicates minorities 
recognize that extremist positions are not productive in 
terms of advancing minority interests.  Djukic might get 
headlines, but ethnic Serbs appear to agree that he did not 
deserve to get their vote. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) The SDSS will enter Parliament with a strong mandate 
from ethnic Serbs, and they are going to be under tremendous 
pressure to produce.  Time is running out (hostilities ended 
eight years ago, and Eastern Slavonia was reincorporated into 
Croatia six years ago), and expectations are going to be high 
for the SDSS to achieve concrete results on immediate issues, 
such as property and tenancy/occupancy rights, and on 
long-term and more systemic problems, such as employment and 
job creation.  The SDSS was elected both on name recognition 
-- Stanimirovic due to his role with Erdut processes in 
Eastern Slavonia, Pupovac as a former Member of Parliament 
(1995-1999) and Zagreb-based activist, and Gajica in Knin -- 
as well as for successfully conveying the message that they 
can work within parliament to produce meaningful results. 
The day after elections they reached out to the other five 
minority representatives, and they plan to meet soon to 
discuss what role they can play in promoting their issues in 
the next government\'s mandate.

END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) HDZ PRESIDENT IVO SANADER HAS ALREADY TAKEN HIS 
VICTORY LAP AND SDP PRESIDENT (AND FORMER PM) IVICA RACAN HAS 
ALREADY CONCEDED DEFEAT AFTER THE NOVEMBER 23 ELECTION, BUT 
SANADER STILL NEEDS TO LINE UP COALITION PARTNERS TO ENSURE 
HE HAS A MAJORITY IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT.  BEFORE PRESIDENT 
MESIC WILL OFFICIALLY NAME SANADER AS THE PM-DESIGNATE AND 
INSTRUCT HIM TO FORM CROATIA\'S NEXT GOVERNMENT, SANADER MUST 
DEMONSTRATE THAT HIS PROPOSAL WILL PASS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE. 
 
 
3.  (C) THE NUMBER OF SEATS IN CROATIA\'S PARLIAMENT IS NOT 
FIXED BEFORE ELECTIONS.  PARLIAMENTARY SEATS ARE AWARDED TO A 
DISTRICT MADE UP OF OUT-OF-COUNTRY VOTERS (THE \"DIASPORA 
DISTRICT\") BASED ON VOTER TURNOUT.  ENOUGH DIASPORA VOTERS 
TURNED OUT ON NOVEMBER 23 TO SEAT FOUR MPS, BRINGING THE 
    TOTAL NUMBER OF MEMBERS IN CROATIA\'S NEXT PARLIAMENT TO 152. 
THAT MEANS SANADER NEEDS 77 VOTES TO WIN A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE 
FOR HIS GOVERNMENT. 
 
4.  (C) SANADER HAD EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE 
SUPPORT OF A GROUPING OF THE HSLS/DC, BUT THOSE PARTIES FARED 
FAR POORER THAN EXPECTED ON ELECTION DAY AND TOGETHER WON 
ONLY THREE SEATS.  THE HDZ TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON NOVEMBER 24 
(REF) THAT THE HDZ WOULD SEEK TO MAKE A DEAL WITH THE 
CROATIAN PEASANTS\' PARTY (HSS) TO AVOID HAVING TO FORM A 
GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE RIGHT-WING CROATIAN PARTY 
OF RIGHT (HSP).  THE HSS HAS ALREADY INDICATED THAT IT IS 
WILLING TO DEAL, BUT WITH ONLY TEN SEATS, THE HDZ WILL HAVE 
TO MAKE AN OFFER TO THE HSLS/DC AS WELL. 
 
5.  (C) HSS PRESIDENT ZLATKO TOMCIC WILL TRY TO DRIVE A HARD 
BARGAIN.  WHILE THE HSS WAS A RELIABLE COALITION PARTNER FOR 
RACAN\'S SDP, IT OPPOSED SOME ECONOMIC REFORMS AND BLOCKED ANY 
AGGRESSIVE PRIVATIZATION POLICY.  SINCE THE ELECTION, TOMCIC 
HAS MADE PUBLIC THE HSS CRITERIA FOR JOINING A COALITION: A 
MORE DELIBERATE PACE OF ECONOMIC REFORM WITH A STRONGER STATE 
ROLE; WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW FAR SANADER IS WILLING 
TO BEND.  THE HSP, HOWEVER,  HAS BEEN PUBLICLY SIGNALING ITS 
WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE ON ANY ISSUE -- EVEN COOPERATION 
WITH ICTY -- JUST TO GET INTO GOVERNMENT.  THE HDZ WELL 
UNDERSTANDS THAT THE HSP\'S NATIONALIST BAGGAGE WOULD NOT HELP 
CROATIA\'S ASPIRATIONS FOR EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP.  BUT IF 
SANADER CANNOT MAKE A DEAL WITH TOMCIC, HE WILL NEED EVERY 
ONE OF THE HSP\'S EIGHT SEATS AND ALL THREE FROM HSLS/DC TO 
HAVE A ONE-VOTE MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT. 
 
    6.  (C) IN A NOVEMBER 25 MEETING WITH THE DCM, PRESIDENT 
MESIC\'S ADVISER IVICA MASTRUKO TOLD US THAT MESIC WOULD BEGIN 
FORMAL CONSULTATIONS WITH POLITICAL LEADERS ON NAMING SANADER 
AS PM-DESIGNATE BY THE END OF THIS WEEK OR EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
MASTRUKO SAID THAT MESIC WILL INSIST ON SEEING SIGNED 
AGREEMENTS FROM SANADER\'S FUTURE PARTNERS PLEDGING THEIR 
SUPPORT.  MASTRUKO WAS CERTAIN THAT SANADER WOULD EVENTUALLY 
BE NAMED AS PM-DESIGNATE, BUT REJECTED HDZ ASSERTIONS THAT 
THE ETHNIC SERB PARTIES MIGHT SERIOUSLY CONSIDER ENTERING A 
FORMAL COALITION TO SUPPORT SANADER. 
 
7.  (C) \"OFFICIAL\" RESULTS OF THE NOVEMBER 23 ELECTION MAY BE 
DELAYED.  BECAUSE ONE EXTRA, UNACCOUNTED-FOR BALLOT WAS FOUND 
IN A BALLOT BOX, ELECTIONS WILL BE REPEATED IN ONE DISTRICT 
OUTSIDE OF ZAGREB ON NOVEMBER 30.  THE RESULT OF THIS RE-VOTE 
CAN IN NO WAY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, BUT THE 
OVERALL RESULTS MAY NOW NOT BECOME OFFICIAL UNTIL AS LATE AS 
DECEMBER 5.  MASTRUKO SAID THE PARLIAMENT\'S FIRST SESSION  -- 
WHERE SANADER AND HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD RECEIVE AN OFFICIAL 
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE -- COULD POSSIBLY TAKE PLACE IN LATE 
DECEMBER OR MORE PROBABLY IN EARLY JANUARY.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR PROPOSED DECEMBER 6 SECDEF VISIT 
TO CROATIA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C) Your visit to Croatia just two weeks after 
parliamentary elections will give the USG a unique 
opportunity to influence the next government\'s policy. 
Although HDZ President Ivo Sanader has not finished putting 
together the coalition which will give him the support needed 
to pass a vote of confidence, his overwhelming victory in the 
November 23 poll means that he will almost certainly be 
Croatia\'s next Prime Minister by early January. 
 
2.  (C) Even before his campaign went into high gear, Sanader 
made clear his intention to take steps to improve Croatia\'s 
relationship with the U.S.  Since the election, the HDZ has 
in private meetings with the Ambassador and in public 
statements re-affirmed its intention to sign an Article 98 
agreement and to move to deploy Croatian troops to join the 
coalition in Iraq.  Despite the HDZ\'s strong showing in the 
election, however, Sanader\'s majority in parliament will be 
very narrow; he may not be able to deliver easily on these 
pledges.  Nevertheless, it would be appropriate to \"cash this 
check\" by expressing the USG\'s gratitude for these tough 
policy decisions. 
 
3.  (C) Both in meetings with us and with the EU, Sanader has 
demonstrated that he knows the right things to say about 
addressing Croatia\'s war legacy.  While he chooses his words 
carefully, Sanader has said that a government led by the HDZ 
would cooperate with The Hague war crimes tribunal and would 
address refugee return and property restitution issues.  Your 
visit should underscore that both the U.S. and the EU will 
look for results, not just statements on these issues; 
cooperation with the war crimes tribunal is not negotiable. 
 
4.  (C) Croatia made good progress towards NATO membership 
during the tenure of the Racan government.  Just over three 
years ago, Croatia was outside of Partnership for Peace.  Now 
completing its second cycle in the Alliance\'s Membership 
Action Plan, Croatia has demonstrated its commitment to 
making the necessary sacrifices to reform its military and 
develop capabilities to make a contribution to NATO.  One 
important goal of your visit would be to convince Sanader to 
continue the progress begun in the past two years.  This was 
not merely SDP party policy, but a sound direction which met 
with the approval of NATO allies. 
 
5.  (C) Reform of the Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) is 
progressing slowly, but in a positive direction.  The focus 
of CAF\'s reform efforts in 2002 and 2003 has been on 
downsizing and restructuring at the price of not training and 
modernizing the force.  This process is being conducted in a 
transparent manner, with criteria set on professional 
capabilities and the needs of the force, not political 
affiliation.  Croatia has made significant progress in 
de-politicizing its armed forces.  But senior HDZ officials 
have suggested that they may reverse some of this progress. 
Your visit could serve to underscore that NATO expects the 
uniformed services to remain outside of politics. 
 
6.  (C) Although the Racan government -- and President Mesic 
-- were not helpful on Iraq, Croatia has been an active 
supporter of international efforts to combat terrorism. 
Croatia deployed a highly-professional platoon of military 
police to Afghanistan.  This unit functioned as a national 
unit under the supervision of the German contingent during 
ISAF III and is now under Canadian command as part of a 
Canadian MP company in ISAF IV.  Croatia made significant 
contributions of weapons and munitions to the fledgling 
Afghan National Army and made donations of humanitarian 
assistance both to Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 
7.  (C) When the Racan government signaled in July 2003 that 
it might be ready to make a troop contribution for Iraq, 
Croatia established a liaison officer at U.S. CENTCOM 
headquarters to begin technical talks in advance of a 
political decision to deploy.  Although the Racan government 
decided to defer deployment until after elections, Croatia\'s 
liaison officer remains at CENTCOM working to coordinate 
issues from Croatia\'s ISAF mission.  Since this officer 
already in Tampa and since Croatia\'s Special Operations 
Forces soldiers designated for Iraq have already finished a 
five-month training course, deployment of Croatia\'s soldiers 
-- provided the HDZ can line up enough votes in parliament -- 
could take place quickly. 
 
8.  (S/NF) Acquisition of Croatia\'s S-300. Two successive 
Croatian Ministers of Defense have promised, yet not 
delivered on facilitating the transfer to the USG of 
Croatia\'s incomplete, yet highly desirable S-300 (SA-10 
 
 
Grumble) surface-to-air missile.  MOD Antunovic worked 
closely with our Defense Attache to orchestrate transfer of 
this system to the USG, but she ran out of political support 
and time before the parliamentary elections brought a halt to 
the transfer.   Elements of this system are intended for use 
by the U.S. Air Force in testing and validating future 
generation aircraft.  An ongoing legal dispute between the 
GoC and arms purveyor Zvonimir Zubak over S-300 ownership has 
the system locked up in civil court proceedings.  Ceding 
possession rather than ownership is a possible workaround for 
the GoC. Department of State, OSD and Air Force staffs are 
actively involved in this foreign material acquisition case.

RIGHTS

Summary 
------- 
 
1. On December 1-2 the OSCE Croatia Mission\'s Return and 
Reintegration Unit briefed their field staff, regional OSCE 
staff (Belgrade and Sarajevo), and regional UNHCR staff on 
the status of implementation of the GOC\'s plan to address the 
issue of lost Occupancy Tenancy Rights (OTR).  OTR has been 
one of the most important and politically sensitive obstacles 
to sustainable return of refugees and IDPs.  The GOC long 
denied that OTR was even an issue to consider -- then 
finally, without consultation with the international 
community, the GOC announced a program (reftels) in June for 
affected refugees and IDPs to qualify for redress.  There has 
been no implementation to date, the deadline for applying has 
been extended, and the OSCE doubts that anyone will be able 
to move into an apartment before 2005.  End Summary. 
 
 
OSCE Training Seminar on Tenancy Rights 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. On June 12, the GOC announced a program that would provide 
housing solutions to those refugees and IDPs who -- due to 
displacement after independence and during the fighting -- 
lost their \"tenancy rights\" enjoyed under the old Yugoslav 
system of socially-owned apartments (Ref B).  The OSCE and 
UNHCR have argued for years with the GOC that OTR is the last 
significant obstacle to completing the process of return for 
the approximately 185,000 refugees who remain in 
Serbia-Montenegro and the 22,000 who remain in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The OSCE estimates that residents who 
lost OTR include 23,700 families of Croatian Serbs from urban 
areas of Croatia (that remained always under control of the 
GOC), and up to 10,000 families in war-affected areas. 
 
3. In its draft Status Report 13, which is scheduled for 
presentation to the permanent council of the OSCE in Vienna 
on December 18, the OSCE reports that neither of the GOC\'s 
programs, one for inside war-affected areas -- known as Areas 
of Special State Concern (ASSC) after the law of the same 
name -- and the other for outside the ASSC, are not yet 
operational.   The program announced June 12 for areas 
outside ASSC included an initial deadline for applications of 
December 31, 2003.  The international community strongly 
implored the GOC to extend the deadline, and eventually it 
was, to December 31, 2004.  The OSCE and UNHCR believe an 
extensive information campaign will be required in order to 
inform potential applicants, the majority of which reside in 
Serbia-Montenegro.  UNHCR will support live talk shows on 
national public and private television in Serbia-Montenegro. 
However, the GOC\'s public outreach campaign is not likely to 
begin before early spring. 
 
4. Complicating any governmental action at this time is the 
fact that the current ruling coalition in Croatia lost in the 
parliamentary elections held November 23.  It may take weeks 
to form a new ruling coalition, and it may be well into 
January before Ministers and other higher level authorities 
are identified and on the job.  Most observers expect Lovre 
Pejkovic, Assistant Minister and Head of the Office for 
Displaced Persons, Returnees, and Refugees (ODPR) in the 
Ministry of Public Works to keep his position in the new 
government.  However, the OSCE speculates that Pejkovic will 
not have a budget for OTR programs before at least March, no 
apartments will be built before the end of 2004, and the 
first successful applicant for housing will not move into an 
apartment before 2005. 
 
5. Axel Jaenicke, the Head of the Return and Reintegration 
Unit at the OSCE Mission to Croatia, was pessimistic about 
implementation.  He repeatedly pointed out that 
implementation is dependent solely on the goodwill of the 
GOC, because the Government\'s so-called \"Conclusion\" and 
\"Implementation Plan\" are decision documents only and do not 
carry the weight of law.  Potential applicants have no legal 
security and cannot seek redress in a court of law.  As if 
orchestrated to prove Jaenicke\'s point, in introductory 
remarks before the OSCE training seminar, Pejkovic reversed 
prior GOC policy and announced that potential applicants who 
have a pending court case on a housing matter will at the 
same time also be able to apply to ODPR for a housing 
solution under an OTR program. Previously the GOC said no 
 
 
applications would be accepted from those with pending court 
cases.  Jaenicke said he did not expect the GOC to provide 
written confirmation on this change -- an example, in his 
critique, of the non-legal basis for the GOC\'s programs, and 
how much they rely on the whim of those currently in power. 
 
Dissatisfaction with the EC Role 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. Jaenicke was surprisingly critical of the EC at various 
points throughout the two-day OSCE training seminar.  The 
invited EC representative showed up late the first day and 
stayed only briefly.  At least at the working level, there is 
tension between the two missions on the issue of tenancy 
rights -- in contrast to otherwise cozy relations, 
particularly between the two mission heads.  The OSCE, 
particularly if there is a positive avis out of Brussels next 
spring that paves the way for a quicker EU accession, is an 
institution on the way out in Croatia.  Peter Semneby, the 
Head of Mission, expects full funding for the current mandate 
in 2004, but states plainly that major downsizing will begin 
in 2005.  The EC, on the other hand, represents the key to 
Croatia\'s desired future as a normal European state. 
Jaenicke went so far as to tell the 80 participants that the 
OSCE \"does not have a stick here,\" and it will be up the EC 
to monitor implementation and \"challenge\" the goodwill of the 
GOC.  However, he suggested that to rely on the EC to monitor 
implementation was wishful thinking, because the EC has no 
field capacity in Croatia whatsoever. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. Occupancy Tenancy Rights is a vexing issue with a lot of 
gray area.  The OSCE\'s skepticism about the GOC\'s plan to 
address the issue is certainly warranted.  Given the GOC\'s 
record of underestimation, slow implementation, and missed 
deadlines, it is very likely that there will be little 
progress on tenancy rights in 2004.  If the number of 
applicants exceeds the GOC\'s stated expectation of 5,000 then 
it is also likely that the GOC will not have the capacity to 
complete the program by the stated deadline of 2006.  We will 
continue to work with our local OSCE and EU colleagues, to 
press the GOC for action on tenancy rights, and to keep the 
issue on the accession agenda.

SUBJECT: SANADER\'S HDZ STILL COBBLING TOGETHER COALITION; 
MINORITY GOVERNMENT LIKELY 
 
Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Nearly two weeks after his party scored a resounding 
win in Croatia\'s November 23 parliamentary election, HDZ 
President Ivo Sanader is still rounding up votes to pass a 
vote of confidence in the new parliament.  Sanader will 
certainly be Croatia\'s next Prime Minister, but it is taking 
him a bit longer than he expected to get the eleven 
additional votes his HDZ needs for a majority.  The HDZ may 
in fact begin its term with a minority government; Sanader 
already has enough pledges of \"yea\" votes from parties which 
do not intend to enter his coalition.  In a meeting with the 
Ambassador on December 3, Sanader said he would meet with 
President Mesic on December 8 and expected to be named 
\"PM-Designate\" shortly thereafter.  Election results were 
made \"official\" on December 5; the first session of the 
parliament must take place within 20 days.  A new HDZ-led 
government could be in place before Christmas.  End Summary. 
 
HDZ Headed for Minority Government? 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Euphoria from the HDZ\'s big win on November 23 faded 
quickly as Sanader has had to work hard to secure commitments 
from new members of the Sabor to secure the 77-seat majority 
needed to pass a vote of confidence in Croatia\'s new 
parliament.  So far, Sanader has obtained the signatures of 
ten MP\'s (a mixture of small parties, minority 
representatives and three votes from the Croatian Party of 
Pensioners - HSU) to add to the 66 HDZ seats he already 
controls.  While no other MP-elect has officially signed up, 
Sanader has more than enough informal pledges of support for 
his proposed government to pass an initial vote of confidence 
in the parliament. 
 
HSS Decides Against Coalition with HDZ 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Sanader\'s hopes of a comfortable majority were dashed 
on December 2, when the Croatian Peasants\' Party (HSS) turned 
down an offer to enter a coalition with the HDZ. 
Nevertheless, HSS President Zlatko Tomcic agreed to vote to 
support Sanader\'s proposed government, which will give the 
HDZ enough votes to pass a vote of confidence with a few to 
spare.  HSS leaders told us they were under heavy pressure 
from conservative European political leaders to enter 
coalition with HDZ, but resistance from within the HSS to 
joining with their former political opponents threatened 
party stability.  Had the HSS decided to enter government 
with the HDZ, it would almost certainly mean the ouster of 
the eight HSS governors who owe their seats to deals with the 
HDZ\'s political opponents.  Despite his party\'s poor 
performance in the election, HSS party president Tomcic is 
trying to have his cake and eat it too: his deal with Sanader 
reportedly lets HSS appointees keep their political patronage 
jobs while his decision to remain out of the HDZ government 
might let HSS governors remain in their chairs. 
 
EU Ambassadors Insist That HSP Stay Out of Government 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
4.  (C) Sanader lost the option to form a coalition with the 
extreme right-wing Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) when on 
December 1 the Italian Ambassador to Croatia -- after a 
November 27 meeting of all European Union Ambassadors in 
Zagreb -- announced that the HSP was \"unacceptable\" to the EU 
and that a government including the HSP would impede 
Croatia\'s progress toward EU membership.  In a December 3 
meeting with the Ambassador, Sanader said that he had never 
really considered a coalition with the HSP, but was peeved by 
the EU Ambassadors\' \"inappropriate\" interference in Croatia\'s 
internal political affairs. 
 
Sanader Still Searching For The 77th Vote 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Sanader told the Ambassador that he still hoped to 
get at least one more signature.  Negotiations with Furio 
Radin, the representative of Croatia\'s Italian minority are 
still open, Sanader said, and the HDZ still hopes to come to 
some agreement with the three Members-elect representing 
Serbs.  All of Croatia\'s political elite know that Radin 
holds Sanader\'s all-important 77th seat and the pressure is 
on from Sanader\'s political opponents in Istria (where most 
of Croatia\'s ethnic Italians live) to keep Radin out of the 
Government.  Press reports indicate that Radin will be on the 
fence: like the HSS, he will vote confidence in the Sanader 
government, but will not sign on the dotted line. 
 
 
Election Results Final, Parliament Must Sit By Christmas 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
6.  (C) The results from the Novemmber 23 election become 
\"official\" on December 5, two days after they were announced 
by Croatia\'s State Electoral Commission.  Croatia\'s 
constitution requires the first session of the new parliament 
be convened within 20 days of \"completion of the electoral 
process,\" which means it will be gaveled open before December 
25. 
 
Sanader Expects Designation From Mesic 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Sanader told the Ambassador that he expects to meet 
formally with President Mesic on December 8 and be named 
PM-Designate soon after, possibly as early as December 9. 
There is no requirement that the government pass its vote of 
confidence in the Sabor\'s first meeting and Sanader may 
choose to wait until early January. 
 
Ambassador Lays Down Markers With Sanader 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) The Ambassador took the opportunity of his one-on-one 
meeting with Sanader on December 3 to lay down markers about 
how best to show the international community -- and Croatia\'s 
voters -- that an HDZ government will keep Croatia moving 
forward on the road toward integration in Euro-Atlantic 
Institutions.  Sanader seemed to take the advice seriously, 
writing down plenty of notes.  On economics, the Ambassador 
urged Sanader to make a clear statement supporting the 
independence of the Central Bank and to engage in some 
substantive dialogue with the IMF.  On relations with ICTY, 
the Ambassador said there is no room for compromise and urged 
Sanader to ensure his party\'s policy of full cooperation 
remains clear.  On refugee returns, he said the international 
community welcomed Sanader\'s campaign statements, but would 
make its judgments based on policy implementation.  The 
Ambassador told Sanader that the Defense Ministry has made 
good progress toward NATO goals in the past two years, 
particularly on depoliticization of the armed forces and on 
launching the difficult process of downsizing.  The 
Ambassador expressed hope that the next defense minister 
would not reverse these trends. 
 
9.  (C) The Ambassador said that the USG took the HDZ\'s 
campaign pledge to sign an Article 98 Agreement as a 
commitment.  We did not welcome reports that Miomir Zuzul, 
Sanader\'s likely appointee to be Croatia\'s next foreign 
minister, may have been walking back that commitment during 
recent meetings in Washington. 
 
10.  (C) Sanader thanked the Ambassador, and while he 
resisted making predictions about the makeup of his proposed 
government, he rejected press speculation that either of the 
former Defense Ministers now in the HDZ parliamentary caucus, 
Luka Bebic or Andrije Hebrang, would be named as Croatia\'s 
next defense minister.  (Note: Both Bebic and Hebrang have 
made statements suggesting they would reward political 
loyalty within the uniformed services.  End Note.)  Sanader 
welcomed the Ambassador\'s proposal to continue to meet 
regularly as plans for the next Croatian government take 
shape.

Classified By: Nicholas Hill, Political-Economic Counselor, for reasons 
 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.   (C) President Mesic is satisfied that relations with the 
incoming government led by HDZ should go smoothly.  That is 
what his top domestical political advisor, Igor Dekanic, told 
us in his office on December 5.  He said that HDZ President 
Ivo Sanader should get the formal nod from the president on 
December 9 and the parliament could be convened before 
Christmas.  President Mesic intends to give the new 
government the benefit of the doubt, and is counting on it to 
continue to carry out a largely pro-reform agenda.  With a 
slim margin in the Parliament, the government may not last 
its full four-year mandate, but should be around through 
presidential voting in early 2005.  On issues of concern to 
the U.S., Dekanic predicted that a decision to send troops to 
Iraq was doable and, now that there is a UN resolution in 
place, President Mesic should be on board.  By contrast, with 
the votes not adding up in parliament, he indicated that the 
new government would have a very difficult time getting an 
Article 98 agreement approved in the Sabor.  End summary. 
 
Smooth Sailing Ahead? 
--------------------- 
 
2.   (C) President Mesic\'s top domestic political advisor, 
Igor Dekanic, was more positive than we expected in our first 
meeting since the elections swept out PM Racan\'s reform 
coalition.  He said that President Mesic understood well the 
wish of Croatian voters and fully intended to make the best 
of the new circumstances and try to work well with an HDZ-led 
government.  Mesic, whose relations with Racan have always 
been rocky, even quipped that he was a \"founding member\" of 
HDZ -- which is true, before he quit in 1993 -- and 
recognized that the party had gone through reforms in recent 
years.  \"In every joke there is some truth,\" Dekanic told us. 
 He added that the Office of the President has even received 
private assurances that relations with the incoming 
government would be much better than they were under Racan. 
Dekanic indicated that the HDZ may even join Mesic\'s 
traditional allies in the current Racan government to support 
Mesic openly for President when as everybody expects he runs 
again in early 2005.  Alternatively, Dekanic added 
implausibly, HDZ could offer up a weak candidate of its own, 
assuring Mesic\'s victory. 
 
Coalition Jockeying 
------------------- 
 
3.   (C) Dekanic described Sanader\'s coalition jockeying 
pretty much as it has been described in the press, with a 
concerted effort on the HDZ leader\'s part to look responsible 
and reform-minded.  Dekanic said Sanader took to heart what 
the European ambassadors said after the elections about the 
right-wing Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), and will do 
everything to avoid bringing the party into any coalition -- 
certainly initially.  Early in an HDZ government\'s mandate, 
Sanader should enjoy a fairly comfortable margin in the 
parliament, Dekanic predicted.  The new government could 
count on the support of the Peasants Party (HSS) and even the 
Serbian representatives elected on the minority list, 
although neither party will be part of the HDZ-led coalition. 
 Dekanic confirmed that HSS leader Tomcic is having serious 
trouble inside his own party, which made it impossible to 
join any HDZ government.  He added that the three new Serbian 
representatives in parliament were demanding a lot for their 
support -- but some of this, he suggested, may be political 
posturing that will settle down.  He held out at least a 
small possibility that the Serbian SDSS representatives could 
eventually be persuaded to join the government. 
 
Troops to Iraq/Article 98 
------------------------- 
 
4.   (C) We asked Dekanic to predict if the new parliament 
would be able to deliver a vote to deploy troops to Iraq and 
approve an Article 98 agreement.  He said that troops to Iraq 
looked likely to pass if Sanader wanted it -- although, given 
the two-thirds majority required, nothing was certain. 
Dekanic indicated that there were probably enough votes in 
the opposition to cross the hurdle and, now with a UN 
Security Council resolution in place, he noted that President 
Mesic would also be supportive. 
 
5.   (C) On Article 98, Dekanic was much more cautious. 
President Mesic continues to object on principle.  There is 
no certainty that even if the new Prime Minister pushes hard 
for it, Sanader would be able to secure the necessary 
two-thirds support in parliament.  He would need to recruit 
many unlikely partners in the Parliament -- including the far 
right HSP, which having been spurned by Sanader in coalition 
negotiations, is unlikely to play a helpful role on this sort 
 
of issue. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.   (C) President Mesic\'s constitutional authority is quite 
limited, so he is probably wise -- and being politically 
expedient -- to give the new government the benefit of the 
doubt.  Like many others in Croatia, the President is 
satisfied with what Sanader is saying and hopes that the new 
Prime Minister will be able to deliver on a reform agenda. 
For his part, Sanader sees Mesic as an important ally. 
Dekanic correctly pointed out that the Croatian President has 
enormous credibility in the West and his seal of approval 
will be important in coming months as Sanader sets out to 
keep progress toward the EU and NATO on course. 
 
7.   (C) The pay off for Mesic will be what HDZ does when 
Mesic runs for reelection in early 2005.  Dekanic predicted 
that Mesic may run with support from all mainstream quarters 
-- that is, with the HDZ-led coalition and the previous 
SDP-led coalition.  Mesic, the longest of long shots at the 
start of the last presidential election in 2000, would look 
like a juggernaut the second time around.  But a year is a 
long time in Croatian politics, and a lot can change, 
particularly given a parliament that is so evenly split.

Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank, reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
SUMMARY and ACTION REQUEST 
-------------------------- 
 
1. (C) Prime Minister-Designate Ivo Sanader and his new-look 
HDZ will take office in late December following their strong 
showing in the November 23 parliamentary elections.  Although 
the HDZ\'s voter base still includes many hard-line 
nationalists, Sanader\'s pro-European / pro-U.S. campaign 
included promises to cooperate fully with the ICTY.  We want 
to ensure Sanader follows through, but believe that at this 
time, a concerted but private approach would be most 
effective.  While the Ambassador continues to encourage 
Sanader to deal directly and personally with Carla del Ponte 
and vigorously seek to find and deliver ICTY fugitive Ante 
Gotovina to The Hague, we would like to delay any additional 
public campaign of the Rewards-for-Justice program to give 
Sanader the opportunity to make good on his campaign 
promises. 
 
2. (C) We think the time will be right for Ambassador Prosper 
to come to Zagreb as soon as the new government settles into 
office ) mid to late January ) to reinforce our non-public 
pressure before Sanader\'s promises to cooperate with the ICTY 
are lost in the push and pull of local politics.  The new 
government should also be pushed to implement recently-passed 
laws that will support development of domestic war crimes 
prosecution capabilities, as Ambassador Prosper was promised 
on his last visit to Zagreb (ref A).  Post recommends that 
the long-planned war crimes assistance assessment team come 
to Zagreb immediately following Ambassador Prosper\'s visit, 
but only if we can identify sufficient funding for an 
assistance program.  End Summary and Action Request. 
 
Sanader\'s ICTY Promise 
---------------------- 
 
3. (C) Prime Minister-designate Ivo Sanader made repeated 
pledges on the campaign trail that, if elected, the HDZ would 
cooperate fully with the ICTY.  Part of this may well have 
been Sanader\'s calculation that the international community 
needed to hear this message to calm fears that a restored HDZ 
would mean a return to the bad old days of Franjo Tudjman. 
However, while he was careful never to say explicitly that 
his government would transfer PIFWC Ante Gotovina, Sanader 
took a real risk of alienating part of his party base.  Since 
winning a plurality of seats in the Sabor, Sanader has 
signaled that he is ready to follow through on ICTY 
cooperation, including comments this week that the GoC would 
cooperate with the ICTY even when it does not agree with it, 
a veiled reference to Gotovina.  He rejected a coalition with 
the hard-right HSP, even though his government will have only 
the slimmest of majorities.  More importantly, Sanader has 
announced that he will personally manage the issue of ICTY 
cooperation. 
 
Holding Him To His Word 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador has developed a frequent but very 
non-public dialogue with Sanader and Foreign 
Minister-designate Miomir Zuzul on ICTY cooperation and other 
issues.  Sanader and Zuzul confirm their intention to work 
with the ICTY.  Further, they have floated trial balloons 
with the ICTY head of office about modalities for PIFWC Ante 
Gotovina to turn himself in to the Tribunal.  We will 
continue to reiterate our private message to Sanader that 
ICTY cooperation is a precondition for the new government to 
build a positive relationship with the U.S.  While we cannot 
be sure whether Sanader can deliver Gotovina, we continue to 
make it clear that the U.S. agrees with the international 
community consensus: Croatia must demonstrate full and 
complete cooperation on all issues with the ICTY, including 
Gotovina. 
 
Time is right for Ambassador Prosper 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) With Sanader\'s cabinet just about to settle into 
office, a visit to Zagreb in the third or fourth week of 
January by Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Pierre 
Prosper would maximally reinforce our message on Croatian 
 
 
behavior on war crimes issues.  Ambassador Prosper can make 
clear in face-to-face meetings with Sanader and the key new 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, and Justice 
that the U.S. expects the new government to prove itself 
ready to join Euro-Atlantic institutions by the actions it 
takes on war crimes issues.  Beyond cooperation with the ICTY 
and the surrender of Gotovina, we should push the new 
government to move quickly to create special war crimes 
courts and to implement the witness protection program called 
for in laws passed at the end of the last government\'s 
mandate.  Ambassador Prosper can seek to renew commitments on 
this made to him by the previous government. 
 
Wait on Rewards-for-Justice Push 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) We believe that any U.S.-backed publicity campaign now 
to push for PIFWC information via the Rewards-for-Justice 
(RFJ) program would send the wrong message: the U.S. does not 
trust the sitting government to make a concerted effort to 
find PIFWCs like Gotovina.  Further, Ambassador Prosper\'s 
comments during his last visit on the RFJ program were widely 
miss-construed by the press (refs A & B).  There have been 
only 68 calls and almost no useful information coming to the 
embassy\'s hot line as a result of the publicity generated for 
the RFJ program (refs C & E).  Thus, we believe that any U.S. 
public comments on Croatian PIFWCs should focus on the 
opportunity the new government has to demonstrate by its 
actions toward the ICTY and the international community its 
full adoption of the core values of the Euro-Atlantic 
community.  We should give Sanader a grace period in office 
to deliver on Gotovina before reconsidering the need for 
another targeted RFJ push in Croatia. 
 
ICTY Completion Strategy Needs Jump-start 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) ICTY representatives have told us that Croatia should 
be prepared to take over approximately 25 major war crimes 
cases under the Completion Strategy.  The outgoing government 
leaves for the HDZ a mixed legacy on building domestic war 
crimes prosecution capabilities (refs D & F).  It brought to 
Zagreb Chief State Prosecutor Mladen Bajic, who is widely 
regarded as an honest and fair prosecutor with a deep 
interest in building the institutional capacities of his 
office.  Likewise, the outgoing government brought in as 
Director General of Police Ranko Ostojic, who is also 
generally respected by the international community.  While 
Ostojic was unable to deliver Gotovina, he did catch PIFWC 
Ivica Rajic and, with Bajic, helped dig out key information 
on the Tudjman-developed Operation Haag to hide PIFWCs in 
Croatia.  Further, Bajic led the effort to convict Croatian 
war criminal Mirko Norac.  However, the Paulin Dvor 
investigation has languished, possibly to avoid uncomfortable 
revelations during the recent elections. 
 
8. (C) While Ostojic may not survive the government 
transition, Sanader appears inclined to keep Bajic on for 
now.  We need to take advantage of positive personalities in 
key professional positions now, to help institutionalize 
reforms they have initiated.  The challenges remaining should 
not be overblown, but remain significant.  Local prosecutors 
continue to waste court time pursuing trials-in-absentia 
against Serbian suspects.  While one judge was widely praised 
for impartiality in a highly charged war crimes case against 
a Croatian, another judge recently issued a war crimes 
verdict that reads more like the rantings of an angry mob 
than the reasoned consideration of a judicial professional. 
 
Let\'s Deliver Promised War Crimes Assistance 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) We can help firm up the position of key players who 
promote institutional reform ) who would be most receptive 
to our assistance ) by delivering on our long-standing 
commitment to begin a war crimes assistance program.  This 
should start with the visit of an assessment team immediately 
following Ambassador Prosper\'s visit.  The team should be 
prepared to consider focusing initial assistance on helping 
the police develop their witness protection program. 
Although the State Prosecutor\'s office has developed strong 
capabilities with our assistance, we should look at following 
up with programs on complex case management and task force 
development as a priority.  The EU CARDS program has a 
comprehensive judicial training project that is only just 
beginning to get rolling.  We should consider focusing our 
efforts on judicial training on specific, practical issues 
such as the sensitivities of managing a war crimes trial and 
 
 
the requirements for accepting evidence developed outside of 
Croatia, i.e. either in Serbia or Bosnia and Herzegovina or 
by the ICTY. 
 
Funding Problem 
--------------- 
 
10. (C) In preparing previous outlines of a war crimes 
assistance program, post had relied on commitments by the 
Department to provide USD 1 million each of SEED FY-03 and 
FY-04 regional funds (ref G and previous).  Post understands 
that FY-03 funds were redirected to assist in the creation of 
Bosnia\'s war crimes court.  Post has just received 
information (ref H) that FY-04 regional SEED funds are also 
no longer available.  While we will review our resource 
allocations, we are not optimistic about finding additional 
funds as we have previously fully programmed bilateral FY-04 
SEED funds (ref I).  Launching a credible war crimes 
assistance program requires adequate funding.  If we cannot 
identify sufficient funds, we should not initiate such a 
program.

SUBJECT: CROATIAN TRADE SPAT WITH HUNGARY 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified -- please handle accordingly. 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Recent headlines announcing the death of the 
Hungarian-Croatian Free Trade Agreement are premature, but 
not by much.  Hungary\'s decision to raise tariffs on 
selected Croatian products may be a last gasp of 
exasperation before Hungary apparently loses its ability to 
single out countries for special treatment upon its entry 
into the EU.  While trade negotiators and veterinarians 
will hopefully find a compromise over the meat 
certification issue that has provoked this mini-trade war, 
the Minister of Agriculture has warned that Hungary has 
more to lose than Croatia should Croatia decide to 
reciprocate.  End Summary. 
 
Another case of BSE-fallout? 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The trade tensions that ultimately resulted in 
Hungary raising its tariffs on December 9 on 15 items -- 
mainly processed food -- arose out of a Croatian decision 
in May to ban all meat products from livestock fed with 
bone meal, whether they be ruminants (such as cows) or non- 
ruminants (such as chickens and pigs).  The U.S. and other 
countries argue that there is little risk in using bone 
meal to feed animals that do not contract BSE-like 
diseases.  Croatia itself banned the practice of using bone 
meal feed for all livestock three years ago, whereas 
Hungary (like the U.S.) at first only banned the use of 
bone meal for ruminants when BSE first broke out in Europe. 
 
3.  (SBU) According to our contacts at the Ministry of 
Agriculture, after originally protesting the Croatian ban, 
Hungary adopted a similar measure this past summer. 
However, it gave its agricultural producers 60 days to 
implement the measure, presumably in order to give them 
time to use up existing bone meal stocks and to find 
substitutes.  Croatia duly lifted the ban on products from 
Hungary, as long as they were \"bone meal free.\" 
 
4.  (SBU) While Hungary wanted Croatia to accept meat 
products from a list of about 200 Hungarian companies that 
Hungarian veterinarians were willing to certify as bone- 
meal-free (companies which had adopted a \"voluntary ban\"), 
Croatia demanded testing and traceability.  The Croatians 
wanted to do random checks of a number of these \"bone meal 
free\" meat plants.  This apparently was the final straw for 
the Hungarians 
 
5.  (U) On December 9, Hungary suspended FTA rates for 15 
Croatian products.  In effect, the low FTA-rates reverted 
back to MFN rates.  This can be a high barrier -- in one 
example, the tariff on dried soups jumped from four percent 
to 32 percent.  The Croatians claim this was done without 
prenotification and in violation of the provisions of the 
FTA, which calls for consultations if \"interests\" are 
damaged and before any privileges are withdrawn, though 
they admit the Hungarians had indicated there would be 
consequences if Croatia continued to block pork imports 
once Hungary had a comprehensive ban in place.  The 
Croatians claim they learned of the tariff changes the day 
they were implemented.  While exports to Hungary only make 
up less than three percent of Croatian exports, the tariffs 
hit a few companies, most significantly Podravka, hard. 
While Prime Minister Racan has spoken of how a trade war 
would hurt everyone, Minister of Agriculture Pankretic has 
pointedly reminded the Hungarians that they have more to 
lose than Croatia.  In the first 10 months of 2003, Croatia 
exported only $67 million of goods to Hungary, but imported 
$350 million from that country. 
 
Or Croatian Protectionism? 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) While Croatia is probably motivated partly by 
protectionism, the picture is a bit more complicated than 
that.  While Hungary is reportedly facing a surplus of pork 
and depressed prices, Croatia is actually in a shortage 
situation, especially for higher quality pork, and has been 
importing pork for a number of years.  Shortages have been 
exacerbated by foot-and-mouth disease in some of its source 
 
countries.  Nevertheless, Croatian pork producers have 
tried to urge the government to \"encourage\" meat processors 
to use lower quality, higher priced Croatian pork.  They 
can argue that with the total bone meal ban they have lived 
with for three years, they face higher costs and need a 
level playing field.  This justification will be eliminated 
in a few months time, when the generation of Hungarian pigs 
old enough for slaughter will all be from the post-ban era. 
 
7.  (SBU) Additionally, Croatian officials are extremely 
cautious -- even over-cautious -- in the face of public 
concern about BSE.  Bureaucratic pride may have played a 
role as well -- the Hungarian veterinarians did not like 
having their certificates questioned, while the Croatians 
did not like being told they did not have the right to 
verify these certificates. 
 
8.  (SBU) While the FTA will lapse upon Hungary\'s entry 
into the EU in May 2004, Croatia will then face in the 
Hungarian market the generally low preferential tariffs it 
enjoys with the EU.  Our contacts tell us that Hungary 
should lose its ability to single out countries for 
punishment (the possibility of misusing sanitary measures 
will remain, no doubt).  However, May is a long way off for 
the companies that are negatively affected, and the GOC 
hopes to negotiate a solution.  If not, Croatia may well 
retaliate.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH PM-DESIGNATE SANADER: 
FLAGGING U.S. CONCERNS 
 
Classified By: Nicholas Hill, Political-Economic Counselor, for reasons 
: 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.   (C) We have \"extremely high expectations.\"  That was how 
Ivo Sanader described on December 19 what he hopes will be 
very good bilateral relations with the U.S. when he becomes 
Croatia\'s Prime Minister next week.  Meeting at the 
Ambassador\'s request in the HDZ party headquarters, Sanader 
stressed that his early priorities would be moving full 
throttle toward EU and NATO membership.  He said he 
understands U.S. priorities in Croatia and wants to become 
our \"strategic partner\" in the region.  When the Ambassador 
flagged several issues of concern to the U.S., Sanader took 
them on board.  He promised to work to ratify the MOU on 
intellectual property in January.  On refugee returns, he 
said he wants to move faster than the previous government and 
has already made progress with Croatia\'s leading Serbian 
political party.  On ICTY, he said he was determined to get 
relations off to a good start (septel to follow).  On an 
Article 98 agreement, Sanader promised to move as fast as he 
could, but obvious near-term constraints loomed.  End 
summary. 
 
NATO a Bigger Priority 
---------------------- 
 
2.   (C) Prime Minister-designate Ivo Sanader, joined by 
incoming Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul, met the Ambassador on 
December 19 at HDZ headquarters.  He said he intends to be 
\"very ambitious\" in his first months in office.  Priority 
would remain getting Croatia into NATO and the EU.  NATO 
membership was a strategic priority -- Sanader hopes it can 
be accomplished by 2006 -- but he sees it as part of a 
process that can only speed up Croatia\'s EU membership.  The 
Prime Minister-designate pointed to the 10 new countries 
entering the EU next spring as an example of this symbiotic 
relationship.  He said he looks forward to discussing 
Croatia\'s NATO aspirations at the Istanbul Summit in May. 
The Ambassador stressed that the U.S. remains committed to 
seeing Croatia join NATO, hoped that the government can 
continue the requisite defense reforms, but cautioned that 
NATO\'s timetable is also governed by other outside factors. 
 
EU Aspirations on Track 
----------------------- 
 
3.   (C) Sanader was satisfied that Croatia\'s EU aspirations 
remain well on track.  He had a good conversation with Romano 
Prodi on December 18.  Prodi had not been \"precise\" in his 
assurances, but Sanader said he was confident that Croatia 
would receive a positive avis sometime in the spring, and he 
hopes it would be approved by the Council of Ministers 
sometime around June.  In the meantime, German Chancellor 
Shroeder invited Sanader for an official visit to Berlin on 
January 8.  Sanader said he will be in Brussels for meetings 
with Prodi at the European Commission and the new NATO 
Secretary General on January 12-13, and travel to Strasbourg 
 
SIPDIS 
after that.  In a visit that was postponed from this week, he 
plans to be in Rome for meetings with Prime Minister 
Berlusconi and the Pope on January 20.  The new Prime 
Minister\'s schedule is filling up. 
 
Article 98 
---------- 
 
4.   (C) Related to Croatia\'s EU focus, Sanader told the 
Ambassador that he wanted to work with us on an Article 98, 
but that he would have to be very cautious.  He said in 
talking to Prodi and others about Croatia\'s EU aspirations, 
Article 98 was always there -- or, as he put it, always 
\"somewhere present in the air.\"  The Ambassador underscored 
that signing an Article 98 with Croatia remains a priority in 
Washington and that we want to move forward on it.  Sanader 
said he would work with us, but timing would be important. 
He noted it would be enormously difficult to get the 
two-thirds support such an agreement would require in the 
Croatian Parliament, probably not before the European Council 
of Ministers approved Croatia\'s avis next summer. 
 
IPR MOU 
------- 
 
5.   (C) When the Ambassador discussed the long-stalled 
Memorandum of Understanding on Intellectual Property Rights 
between Croatia and the U.S., Sanader promised to move it to 
the Croatian Parliament for ratification.  Both Sanader and 
Zuzul were familiar with the issue -- Zuzul had been the 
Croatian Ambassador in Washington when the MOU was first 
 
 
signed in 1998 -- and looked eager not to let it become a 
thorn in our bilateral relations.  Zuzul told the Ambassador 
the problem had always been Croatian Pharmaceutical company 
Pliva\'s opposition.  The Ambassador noted that he had 
discussed the issue with Pliva\'s CEO and been assured that 
the company would not oppose ratification.  By way of 
concluding discussion on the MOU, Sanader turned to Zuzul and 
said, \"Let\'s do it immediately.\"  Zuzul nodded, and they 
indicated it should be ratified by January. 
 
Refugees, Serbian Community 
--------------------------- 
 
6.   (C) Sanader wanted to raise with the Ambassador progress 
he had made with Croatia\'s leading ethnic Serbian Party 
(SDSS).  SDSS would not join the government but it agreed to 
support the HDZ-led coalition in the Parliament.  To secure 
the agreement, Sanader said, he promised to work much more 
effectively and proactively to secure refugee return and on 
\"all other open issues\" -- including even tenancy rights, an 
issue which the previous government had dragged out endlessly 
over its mandate.  We \"don\'t want delays like under Racan,\" 
he said.  The Prime Minister-designate boasted that the new 
coalition now enjoys the support of \"all\" the minority 
communities in Croatia. 
 
Croatian Troops to Iraq 
----------------------- 
 
7.   (C) Two other issues the Ambassador raised with Sanader 
included sending Croatian troops to Iraq and concern that a 
Croatian ship-yard is contemplating refitting a Libyan naval 
vessel.  After repeated delays, Croatian authorities had 
already indicated tentatively that it would act positively on 
dispatching troops to Iraq, but time ran out in the previous 
government\'s mandate.  The Ambassador handed Sanader a 
non-paper describing to him the modalities for the new 
government to move forward should it seek to commit troops. 
Sanader took it on board, professed not to know much about 
the subject, but reminded the Ambassador that he had been 
supportive of the U.S. Iraq policy since before the war 
started.  Dispatching troops to Iraq -- the MOD has in mind a 
Special Forces unit -- would, like an Article 98, require a 
two-thirds vote in the Parliament. 
 
Libya Vessel 
------------ 
 
8.   (C) The Ambassador also took the opportunity to brief 
the incoming Prime Minister on the firm U.S. position 
concerning Libya.  There have been reports, he said, that a 
contract had been signed to refit a Libyan naval vessel 
called the \"Al-Munyed\" at a Rijeka shipyard.  The Ambassador 
stressed that military cooperation with Libya had no 
productive future and could be illegal under U.S. law. 
Sanader said he knew nothing about any possible deal, but 
promised to look into the matter.  The Ambassador urged the 
Prime Minister-designate to take up the matter with President 
Mesic, who has been informed of the U.S. position. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.   (C) It is prudent to stay in wait-and-see mode, but so 
far the Prime Minister-designate has made no wrong moves or 
statements.  The bad news is clearly that he recognizes the 
difficulty of delivering an Article 98 agreement in the 
immediate future, but he wants to keep working at it.  We 
will see where this leads.  He knows it is important to us 
and that we hold some cards -- in particular, the U.S. has 
been Croatia\'s biggest NATO backer.  Notwithstanding this 
obstacle, Sanader and Zuzul are keen to get the relationship 
off to the right start.  They want to visit Washington early 
in the new government\'s mandate and hold some high level 
meetings.  If they stay on the reform course they have 
plotted, and are able to deliver on some of their promises -- 
such as a ratified MOU -- we should be receptive to granting 
the new Prime Minister a good visit sometime early in the new 
year.  We believe it important to reach out to them now, 
especially with the EU moving so quickly to gain their 
support of positions which -- on some issues -- are contrary 
to our own.

CLASSIFIED BY: NICHOLAS HILL, POLECON COUNSELOR, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN

SUMMARY 
------- 

1.   (C) CROATIA\'S INCOMING PRIME MINISTER, IVO SANADER, 
CALLED UP CHIEF PROSECUTOR CARLA DEL PONTE ON DECEMBER 19 TO 
UNDERSCORE HIS DESIRE TO MAINTAIN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE 
WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL.  TOM OSORIO (STRICTLY PROTECT), THE HEAD 
OF THE ICTY OFFICE IN ZAGREB, TOLD US AFTER THE TELEPHONE 
CALL THAT THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR WAS \"EXTREMELY HAPPY\" AT 
SANADER\'S INITIATIVE.  THE CONVERSATION WAS CONSTRUCTIVE, HE 
SAID, AND PUTS THE NEW GOVERNMENT\'S RELATIONS WITH THE HAGUE 
ON A VERY GOOD FOOTING.  EARLIER ON DECEMBER 19, OSORIO MET 
WITH FOREIGN MINISTER-DESIGNATE MIOMIR ZUZUL, AND DISCUSSED A 
RANGE OF ISSUES THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE WITH THE 
TRIBUNAL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   (C) SANADER\'S CALL ON DECEMBER 19 TO DEL PONTE CAME 
AFTER HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR EARLIER ON THE SAME DAY (REF) 
THAT HE WANTED TO MAKE THE INITIATIVE BUT WAS CONCERNED -- 
NAMELY, BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT ANY CONVERSATION WITH DEL 
PONTE REPORTED IN THE PRESS AT THIS STAGE.  SOON AFTER WE 
REPORTED THIS TO OSORIO, HE MET WITH ZUZUL AND OFFERED 
ASSURANCES.  SANADER PLACED THE CALL LATER ON THE SAME DAY. 
FOR HIS PART, OSORIO SAID HIS MEETING WITH ZUZUL, HIS FIRST 
WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER-DESIGNATE, WENT WELL.  HE DESCRIBED 
HIS OFFICE\'S WORK, WHERE RELATIONS WITH THE PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT HAD GONE WELL AND WHERE THEY FELL SHORT -- 
PRIMARILY WITH RESPECT TO DELIVERING FUGITIVES, MOST NOTABLY 
ANTE GOTOVINA. 
 
3.   (C) OSORIO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL ZUZUL THAT THE 
TRIBUNAL VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THE WORK OF THE HEAD OF THE 
GOC\'S ICTY COOPERATION OFFICE, JAKSA MULJACIC AND, MORE 
    IMPORTANTLY, THE GOC\'S STATE PROSECUTOR MLADEN BAJIC.  ZUZUL 
TOOK HIS COMMENTS ON BOARD AND APPARENTLY PASSED THEM ON TO 
SANADER; DURING HIS TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH DEL PONTE, 
THE PRIME MINISTER-DESIGNATE SAID HE PLANNED TO KEEP 
MULJACIC, WHO KNOWS DEL PONTE WELL FROM HIS TOUR AS CROATIA\'S 
AMBASSADOR IN THE HAGUE.  SANADER WAS LESS COMMITTAL ABOUT 
BAJIC, BUT ACCORDING TO OSORIO -- AND WE HAVE HEARD SIMILAR 
REPORTS -- THERE ARE NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO REPLACE THE 
CURRENT STATE PROSECUTOR, WHO HAS BEEN OFFICE FOR LESS THAN 
TWO YEARS.  BAJIC HAS DEVELOPED A REPUTATION FOR FAIRNESS AND 
PROVED TO BE AN EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATOR. 
 
4.   (C) OSORIO TOLD ZUZUL HOW THE TRIBUNAL HOPED ITS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH CROATIA WOULD DEVELOP UNDER THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT.  HE REMINDED THE INCOMING FOREIGN MINISTER THAT 
THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE A QUICKER PACE OF ACTIVITY IN COMING 
MONTHS, WHICH HAD SLOWED DOWN OWING IN PART TO CROATIA\'S 
ELECTIONS SEASON.  BEFORE MEETING ZUZUL, OSORIO EXPRESSED 
SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY THE INCOMING PRIME MINISTER HAD 
REPORTEDLY INDICATED A DESIRE TO BE THE GOC\'S POINT PERSON 
FOR RELATIONS WITH THE TRIBUNAL.  OSORIO TOLD US THAT THE 
PROSECUTOR SAW THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP AS 
KEEPING IT FOCUSED AT THE JUSTICE SECTOR LEVEL.  ALTHOUGH NOT 
CLEAR IF HE DISCUSSED THIS WITH DEL PONTE, SANADER TOLD THE 
PRESS OVER THE WEEKEND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE THE GOC\'S POINT 
PERSON WITH THE TRIBUNAL. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.   (C) WE STRESS THAT WHAT SANADER ULTIMATELY SAID TO CARLA 
    DEL PONTE ON DECEMBER 19 CAME TO US THIRD HAND.  THE KEY 
POINT IS THAT, FROM THE TRIBUNAL\'S STANDPOINT, THE 
CONVERSATION SHOWED SANADER TRYING TO REACH OUT.  IT WILL NOT 
TAKE LONG FOR THE NEW HDZ-LED GOVERNMENT TO BE PUT TO THE 
TEST ON ITS COMMITMENTS TO THE ICTY.  WE EXPECT THE TRIBUNAL 
TO DELIVER SEVERAL NEW INDICTMENTS TO THE GOC EARLY IN THE 
NEW YEAR.  THESE INDICTMENTS COMBINED WITH INCREASING 
PRESSURE TO TRACK DOWN ICTY FUGITIVE ANTE GOTOVINA -- WHOSE 
STATUS STILL LOOMS SIGNIFICANTLY AS AN OBSTACLE TO CROATIA\'S 
EU AND NATO ASPIRATIONS -- ENSURES THAT BROMIDES WILL NOT 
PASS FOR COOPERATION.  AND SANADER, WITH A GOOD NUMBER OF 
HARD LINE NATIONALISTS IN HIS RANKS, WILL BE FEELING THE HEAT 
FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS TENURE.

SUBJECT: IMF CONCERNED THAT DEFICITS WILL RISE UNDER NEW 
GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: ZAGREB 2446 
 
Classified By: ECONOMIC OFFICER ISABELLA DETWILER: REASON 1.5 (B AND D) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The incoming government is playing its economic game 
close to its chest.  A visiting IMF team that met informally 
with the HDZ\'s economic players came away without much new 
information.  The HDZ\'s campaign promises, much like the 
campaign promises of the other parties, were expensive. 
Perhaps more worrying, because they were in writing, were the 
concessions the HDZ made to the Pensioners Party (HSU) in 
order to secure its three votes in the next Parliament.  If 
implemented in anything like their current form, concessions 
would severely boost the budget deficit and upset the 
delicate balance the last government reached on pensions. 
 
2.  (C) In what was not a big surprise given the timing of 
the team\'s visit -- right after parliamentary elections -- 
the IMF was not able to complete the third review of the 
Stand-by Arrangement.  It was in no position to judge 
Croatia\'s economic plans for the next 12 months -- primarily 
because the plans do not really exist yet.  The IMF, the 
outgoing government, and Central Bank were able to complete 
an informal, backward-looking review, which found the 
situation generally satisfactory, but with some lingering 
areas of concern.  End Summary. 
 
Expensive Promises 
------------------ 
 
3.  (C)  The two areas of the HDZ\'s economic policies that 
have attracted the most attention appear to have come from 
two different camps within the HDZ.  A cut of two percent in 
the VAT tax was urged by young academic (and former Central 
Bank employee) Ante Babic.  Babic, who is rumored to be 
interested only in an advisory role in the new government, is 
said to believe that this tax cut would stimulate business, 
rather than translate into lower prices.  However, a recent 
roundtable of business people reportedly scoffed at the idea, 
and worried about the fiscal effects.  The VAT cut, estimated 
to cost about 1.2 percent of GDP, would be partially financed 
by increased compliance and enforcement of tax collections, 
optimistically estimated to provide additional revenue of 0.4 
percent of GDP. 
 
Pensioners Strike Back? 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  In an unpublished but well-reported memorandum 
signed by representatives of the HDZ and the HSU, it was 
agreed to increase the base level of pensions and adopt a 
more favorable methodology for indexation. Other goodies are 
rumored, but not confirmed.  World Bank economists have 
estimated that if the additional costs were fully covered by 
additional payroll taxes (not likely), the contribution rate 
would rise from 20 percent to 35 percent.  Even if the 
worst-case scenario does not materialize, any significant 
increase in payroll taxes would create additional 
disincentives to employment.  The World Bank and others also 
worry that these changes will destroy what have been the 
significant accomplishments of the Racan government\'s 
three-pillar pension reform.  One possible result is that the 
private sector second and third pillars would be \"crowded 
out\" by the bulking up of the first, pay-as-you-go, pillar. 
 
5.  (C)  The IFIs have tried, in the absence of hard plans or 
data from the incoming government, to calculate the effect of 
these proposals on the fiscal deficit.  The deficit, which 
was expected to be 4.5 percent of GDP in 2003 and drop to 3.8 
percent next year, could increase to between 5.8 and 8 
percent, depending on assumptions.  The calculation that 
arrives at the lower (but still large) figure increases the 
deficit for the VAT reduction, promised wage increases, 
pension and maternity benefit increases, investments in the 
railroads (also promised by the SDP, to have been paid for by 
social transfer cuts), and decreases the deficit through the 
hoped-for better collection of taxes and a fairly generous 
credit for capital expenditure cuts to the tune of 0.7 
percent of GDP.  While many do not believe that the HDZ will 
be able to implement this full package, if a significant 
fraction of it is, the budget deficit could balloon. 
 
IFIs in Limbo 
------------- 
 
6.  (C)  The IMF team visiting Zagreb in December left after 
signing what was called a letter of intent.  It looked more 
like a memorandum looking back over developments over the 
last few months.  Several players in the process told us that 
 
 
it was not quite clear why the IMF was here.  The GOC\'s 
principle interlocutor with the IMF reportedly opposed the 
team\'s coming, while the Central Bank said that, if the team 
came, it had to complete the review.  As it is, the letter 
signed by the three parties concludes \"...we believe that our 
program implementation during 2003 has been broadly 
satisfactory, and it is our sincere hope that the third 
review can be completed early next year.\"  The IMF has 
tentative plans to come back in late February (the program 
lapses in early April), at which time the next government 
would have to be ready to present detailed plans and a budget. 
 
7.  (C)  When the new IMF Mission Director for Croatia, 
Dimitri Demekas, met with us, he said he had told the HDZ 
leadership -- including Prime Minister-designate Sanader and 
top economic advisor (and incoming Finance Minister) Ivan 
Suker -- to take their time in deciding what form of 
cooperation they would like to have with the IMF.  Demekas 
emphasized to us that he was not pushing another Standby 
Arrangement on the incoming government (a good thing, since 
the HDZ has publicly expressed its skepticism about such a 
program).  The IMF would like to keep engaged, however, 
perhaps through intensive monitoring, and would like to keep 
an office in Zagreb.  According to Demekas, the HDZ officials 
were polite and non-committal. 
 
8.  (C)  The World Bank\'s Country Director also told the 
Ambassador that the World Bank would like to see a strong IMF 
presence in Croatia.  He quipped that while they were 
flattered by HDZ statements that they wanted to \"graduate\" 
from IMF programs and that they would prefer to work more 
closely with the World Bank, the IMF and World Bank came 
together.  We have received mixed information on whether an 
IMF program would be necessary for the next big World Bank 
program, and Programmatic Adjustment Loan. 
 
Racan Government takes a Bow 
---------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  As reported reftel, the Racan government leaves 
office with higher than expected growth -- projected at 5 
percent this year -- and lower than expected inflation.  The 
accumulated government debt has stabilized at 51 percent of 
GDP, the fiscal deficit will come in better than programmed, 
at 4.5 percent of GDP, and even the current account deficit 
is better than feared, at 5.4 percent of GDP.  The dark 
cloud, especially given the Standby Arrangement\'s focus on 
stabilizing overall debt, is the burgeoning foreign debt -- 
public and private -- which increased from 68.5 percent of 
GDP to an expected 74 percent in the past 12 months, spurred 
on also by booming consumer borrowing.  The IMF remains 
unhappy with the Central Bank\'s monetary instruments, and the 
government and Central Bank point fingers at each other 
assigning  blame. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.   (C) The new HDZ-led coalition will have its hands full 
on the economic front, and the fact that it will effectively 
be a minority government will make matters all the more 
tenuous.  Because HDZ made a lot of generous promises during 
the election campaign to cut taxes -- and now must give away 
much to get small coalition partners on board -- it will be 
difficult for the new economic team to start preaching fiscal 
rectitude.  But sooner or later it likely must, and at that 
time it may appreciate having the IMF, in some form, around 
to serve as the bogey man requiring it to do a course 
correction.

SUBJECT: NOW PRESENTING CROATIA\'S NEW GOVERNMENT - SANADER 
CONFIRMED AS PM 
 
Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Croatia\'s newly-constituted parliament confirmed Ivo 
Sanader as Prime Minister On December 23.  The parliament 
also voted confidence in Sanader\'s ministerial appointments. 
The new cabinet will have 15 members, including Sanader and 
two deputy Prime Ministers, a sharp change from Racan\'s 
cumbersome 24-member cabinet.  Sanader\'s lineup shows he took 
pains to avoid nominations with too much baggage from the 
corrupt, nationalist Tudjman-era HDZ.  But that means some of 
the new ministers -- including those in key positions -- will 
be outsiders, who may be slow to trust their staff and may 
have little understanding of ongoing reform processes.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (C) On December 21, PM-Designate and HDZ President Ivo 
Sanader named his new cabinet.  As promised, the new 
government will be smaller than its predecessor, with only 15 
members.  Because Sanader proposed to change the Croatian 
bureaucracy so dramatically, the new parliament had to get 
down to business on December 22, the day it was sworn in. 
Over the objections of the opposition, the HDZ-led parliament 
passed changes to legislation which combine ministerial 
portfolios and change the structure of the government.  The 
coalition led by Sanader\'s HDZ does not have a majority in 
parliament, but these first legislative changes show that the 
political deals he made in the month since parliamentary 
elections are holding. 
 
3.  (C) Despite his party\'s strong showing in elections, 
Sanader had trouble forming his coalition; this is reflected 
in the shape of his government.  The HSLS -- which won only 
two seats in parliament -- reportedly refused Sanader\'s offer 
of a ministerial appointment. The only member of the new 
government from a party other than the HDZ is Vesna 
Skare-Ozbolt, Croatia\'s new Justice Minister. 
 
4.  (C) Even before the November 23 elections, Sanader told 
the Ambassador that his new government would not include 
figures from the bad old days of Tudjman\'s HDZ.  He has kept 
this commitment, but at the cost of appointing some outsiders 
who have little experience on the Zagreb political scene. 
These appointees will likely be slow to trust senior-level 
ministry staff appointed during Racan\'s tenure and will be 
ignorant of some key reform programs still underway. 
 
5.  (C) The changes in the structure of the government are 
far-reaching and will take time to implement.  Sanader has 
pledged to slash the number of independent government 
agencies and offices which had proliferated during the Racan 
government.  In an attempt to make the government bureaucracy 
more efficient, he has done away with the position of Deputy 
Minister (a political appointment) and introduced the 
position of state secretary, a professional position which 
does not require parliamentary approval.  Plans include 
creation of four new \"at-large\" state secretaries to ensure 
sensitive projects move forward promptly. 
 
6.  (C) While most observers of Croatian politics are by now 
familiar with HDZ president Ivo Sanader, we offer the 
following thumbnail sketches of the new Prime Minister\'s 
Cabinet to give an outline of the new Croatian Government. 
 
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader 
-------------------------- 
7.  (C) A polished, eloquent salesman, Sanader (age 50) led 
his HDZ party to a sweeping victory in the November 23 
parliamentary elections less than four years after the HDZ 
was ejected from government.  Sanader sees himself as a 
mainstream conservative in both the European and American 
sense, with all the contradictions that implies.  On one 
hand, he wants to cut the size of government and cut taxes, 
while on the other, he wants to protect domestic markets and 
look after pensioners.  He is eager to present the HDZ as 
reformed and capable of making progress toward integration in 
the EU and NATO.  Sanader is fluent in English, German and 
Italian. 
 
Jadranka Kosor, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of 
Family, Veterans and Intergenerational Solidarity 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
8.  (C) The only woman in the senior ranks of the patriarchal 
HDZ, Kosor has become a strong political player in her own 
right.  A former journalist, she became politically active 
when she covered Croat refugee issues during Croatia\'s 
\"homeland war.\"  Kosor adds a human, even glamorous face to 
the traditionally hard-line HDZ, and her approach to the 
public is shaped by her status as a single mother caring for 
an elderly, infirm parent.  Most observers are still puzzled 
as to what the \"intergenerational solidarity\" part of her 
portfolio means, but all are certain it was included as part 
 
 
of a package which won Sanader the support of the three MP\'s 
from the Croatian Party of Pensioners (HSU). 
 
Andrija Hebrang, Deputy PM 
Minister of Health and Social Welfare 
------------------------------------- 
9.  (C) A long-time member of the HDZ, Hebrang served as 
Minister of Health and (briefly) as Minister of Defense 
during the Tudjman era.  A bit of a political loose cannon, 
Hebrang is apt to say whatever is on his mind and think of 
consequences later.  Deeply conservative, Hebrang\'s 
prominence during the campaign helped the HDZ keep those 
nationalist voters who might not have supported Sanader\'s 
more progressive message.  By appointing Hebrang as Deputy 
Prime Minister, Sanader shows respect to his party\'s right 
wing.  By giving him the Health and Social Welfare 
portfolios, Sanader clearly hopes to keep Hebrang from making 
policy which could negatively affect Croatia\'s EU and NATO 
integration.  A cardiac radiologist who has published a 
number of scientific works, Hebrang is one of Croatia\'s 
leading physicians and continued to see patients daily 
throughout his prior appointments. 
 
Miomir Zuzul, Minister of Foreign Affairs 
----------------------------------------- 
10.  (C) A highly experienced diplomat and one of Sanader\'s 
closest advisers, Zuzul\'s appointment was certain even before 
the election campaign began.  Zuzul remained in Washington 
after his assignment as Croatia\'s Ambassador to the U.S. as a 
consultant for Livingston/Moffett.  His close ties to the 
U.S. and his eagerness to improve bilateral relations have 
drawn some criticism from the local press which suggests 
that he should concentrate on being a \"Croatian minister, not 
an attorney of U.S. interests in Croatia.\" 
 
Bozidar Kalmeta 
Minister of the Sea, Traffic, Tourism and Development 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
11.  (C) Kalmeta has been the mayor of the coastal city of 
Zadar for the past ten years.  Zadar has consistently posted 
Croatia\'s strongest post-war economic growth numbers. 
Kalmeta has a reputation of a pragmatic technocrat who worked 
well with the opposition SDP government on projects for his 
city.  Kalmeta\'s efforts at the head of the HDZ campaign in 
the 9th district produced the best result for the party 
anywhere in Croatia.  Sanader is loading up Kalmeta with 
duties that had been the responsibility of three separate 
ministries under the Racan government.  Kalmeta\'s laid-back 
interpersonal style is well suited to Zadar (or maybe to 
Southern California), but with his new workload, Kalmeta may 
have to keep his beloved motorcycles in the garage. 
Kalmeta\'s international reputation is tainted by his tacit 
agreement to the open display of support and sympathy for the 
ICTY-indicted fugitive General Gotovina, whose photograph 
prominently adorns the city walls in Zadar. 
 
Ivan Suker, Minister of Finance 
------------------------------- 
12.  (C) Suker is Vice President of the HDZ and mayor Velika 
Gorica, a sizeable town on the outskirts of Zagreb.  Unlike 
Kalmeta, however, he seems like an outsider and is perceived 
as a bit of a hick by Zagreb\'s political elite.  A successful 
businessman, Suker has no experience in international finance 
and is considered \"nothing more than a bookkeeper\" by his 
critics.  Suker will have a tough time keeping some of the 
HDZ\'s more populist campaign promises like cutting the 
value-added tax (PDV), increasing pension payments and 
simplifying Croatia\'s income tax.  Suker speaks no English, 
but he will be aptly supported by two young Harvard-educated 
advisers who will lend their technical expertise to this 
political heavyweight. 
 
Berislav Roncevic, Minister of Defense 
-------------------------------------- 
13.  (C) The least-known (and by all early accounts, the 
least-qualified) of all of Sanader\'s appointments, Roncevic 
was reportedly a last-minute choice.  A lawyer by education, 
Roncevic has been Mayor of the Slavonian small town of Nasice 
since June 2003.  His earlier career was in the town\'s 
forestry administration.  Roncevic\'s first political 
statement as Minister-designate looks to us like a misstep; 
in an initial interview, he declared that the old-style HDZ 
nationalist Branimir Glavas is his political mentor.  With no 
political experience in Zagreb and no understanding of the 
complex reform processes underway in the MOD, we will have to 
work hard early in his tenure to bring Roncevic up to speed. 
 
Marijan Mlinaric, Minister of Interior 
--------------------------------------- 
14.  (C) While Mlinaric seems to have little direct 
experience to be Interior Minister, his strong party 
credentials made it likely that he would be given some 
position of prominence in the new government.  A member of 
the HDZ collective presidency, a former MP and a former 
 
 
prefect of Varazdin county, Mlinaric is a surgeon by trade. 
In his first statement to the press, he pledged to make 
Croatia\'s police servants of the people and make sure 
citizens do not view the police force as an instrument of 
repression. 
 
Branko Vukelic 
Minister of Economy, Labor and Entrepreneurship 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
15.  (C) Vukelic was elected Secretary General of the HDZ in 
2002, at the same party convention in which Sanader 
consolidated his control of the HDZ.  Vukelic had been tipped 
in the press as the nominee for Interior Minister, but when 
the press reported rumors of a corruption scandal dating from 
his days as mayor of the city of Karlovac, Sanader changed 
his appointment.  Vukelic will have a portfolio that had 
previously been divided between three ministries; he will 
face a significant management challenge. 
 
Bozo Biskupic, Minister of Culture 
---------------------------------- 
16.  (C) Biskupic served as the HDZ\'s Minister of Culture 
from 1995 - 2000.  Trained as both a lawyer and a museum 
curator, Biskupic (age 65) has been inconspicuous in Croatian 
politics in recent years.  A collector of fine art, Biskupic 
was for a time deputy mayor of Zagreb. 
 
Petar Cobankovic 
Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
17.  (C) Cobankovic\'s background is in agriculture and he 
looks the part of a farmer, but his campaign in Eastern 
Slavonia turned out one of the best results for the HDZ. 
During the war, Cobankovic was a leader in the defense of 
Ilok, Croatia\'s easternmost town before the Serbs drove the 
Croatians out.  Cobankovic told us he will try to use his new 
appointment to reduce Croatia\'s imports of food products, but 
would not specify how he would accomplish this.  Cobankovic 
will be a reluctant Zagreber; he plans on keeping his large 
family at home in eastern Croatia. 
 
Marina Matulovic Dropulic, Minister of Environmental 
Protection, Physical Planning and Construction. 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
18.  (C) An architect by trade, Matulovic Dropulic had the 
same portfolio in previous HDZ governments.  She was Mayor of 
Zagreb until 2000. 
 
Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic, Minister of European Integration 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
19. (C) A career diplomat and an associate of Sanader\'s 
during his stint as Deputy Foreign Minister, Grabar Kitarovic 
took a leave from the MFA to research her doctoral 
dissertation on U.S. Foreign Policy (with help from a 
Fullbright fellowship) at George Washington University.  At 
35, she will be the youngest member of Sanader\'s cabinet; she 
will have big shoes to fill in following Neven Mimica. 
Grabar Kitarovic spent a year as a high school exchange 
student in Los Alamos. 
 
Vesna Skare Ozbolt, Minister of Justice 
--------------------------------------- 
20.  (C) An attorney from Osijek, Skare Ozbolt began her 
career as a senior aide to President Tudjman\'s, and was 
heavily involved in the peaceful reintegration of Eastern 
Slavonia in the late 1990\'s.  Skare Ozbolt is now president 
of the Democratic Center (DC) party, the only party other 
than the HDZ to take an appointment to Sanader\'s cabinet. 
Skare Ozbolt has told the press that she sees her role not as 
a jurist, but as a manager; she intends to leave technical 
work to experts in her ministry.  Sanader recently refuted 
early press reports that he would personally oversee the 
relationship with ICTY -- he asserted that the Justice 
Ministry would retain this function.  Skare Ozbolt strikes us 
as smart, tough and dedicated to Croatia\'s integration into 
Euro-Atlantic institutions.  Unfortunately, as the only 
non-HDZ member in the cabinet, she may be viewed with 
suspicion by her colleagues; this may impede her work. 
 
Dragan Primorac, Minister of Science, Education and Sports 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
21.  (C) Primorac is Sanader\'s only nominee who is not 
formally a member of any political party.  Primorac has been 
active in the process of identifying the remains of missing 
persons from the war and helped develop the Racan 
government\'s relationship with the International Commission 
on Missing Persons.  Primorac studied medicine in the U.S. 
and now teaches forensic medicine at three medical schools in 
Croatia. 
 
Vladimir Seks, President of the Parliament 
------------------------------------------ 
22.  (C) While he is not a member of the cabinet, Seks 
(pronounced Sheks) will probably be Sanader\'s most important 
 
 
ally in pushing forward the HDZ\'s legislative agenda.  As the 
whip of the HDZ when they were in opposition during the last 
parliament, Seks used his considerable procedural expertise 
to keep the Racan government as uncomfortable as possible. 
Now, as the speaker of a parliament where his party\'s 
coalition has no clear majority, he will need all of his 
political cunning to keep the government\'s agenda from being 
derailed.  Although never indicted, Seks is a symbol of the 
corruption and cronyism which marked the late Tudjman era. 
His personal style is not confrontational, and he has an 
ironic sense of humor; at one recent social function, he 
greeted poloff by saying \"Hello, I\'m the reformed Seks.\"

REF: STATE 348293 

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) ON DECEMBER 24, CROATIA BANNED THE IMPORT OF U.S. 
BEEF IN RESPONSE TO NEWS REPORTS OF THE FIRST CASE OF BSE IN 
THE U.S.  ON DECEMBER 29, EMBASSY PRESENTED REFTEL 
NOTIFICATION OF THE BSE CASE IN U.S. TO ASSISTANT MINISTER OF 
AGRICULTURE MIROSLAV BOZIC ON DECEMBER 29.    WHILE CROATIA 
DOES NOT IMPORT BEEF FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION FROM THE U.S., 
SOME PET FOOD IMPORTS WILL PROBABLY BE AFFECTED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NOTIFICATION DELIVERED 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) WE DELIVERED REFTEL NOTIFICATION OF THE BSE CASE IN 
WASHINGTON STATE TO ASSISTANT MINISTER BOZIC ON DECEMBER 29, 
AND PASSED A COPY TO THE MFA AS WELL.  BOZIC WAS AWARE OF THE 
CASE, BUT THANKED US FOR OUR PROMPT OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION. 
WE DISCUSSED THE DECREE ISSUED BY THE MINISTRY ON DECEMBER 24 
WHICH ADDED THE U.S. TO THE LIST OF COUNTRIES FROM WHICH BEEF 
CANNOT BE IMPORTED.  BOZIC EMPHASIZED THAT THE BAN WAS 
TEMPORARY, THOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT NO COUNTRY HAD BEEN TAKEN 
OFF THE LIST SINCE IT WAS ESTABLISHED.  HE THOUGHT THAT MIGHT 
CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, PERHAPS AS EARLY AS IN THE FIRST HALF 
OF 2004, BECAUSE OF PRESSURE FROM THE EU.  BOZIC DID NOT 
THINK THE BAN WOULD AFFECT PET FOOD IMPORTS, WHICH HE 
UNDERSTOOD TO BE SOURCED FROM EU-ACCEPTED SOURCES, AND ASKED 
TO BE ADVISED IF THERE WERE ANY PROBLEMS. 
 
3.  (U) BOZIC NOTED THAT CROATIA STILL DOES NOT HAVE A SINGLE 
    REPORTED CASE OF BSE.  ALL COWS OVER 24 MONTHS OF AGE ARE 
EXAMINED UPON SLAUGHTER, AS WELL AS ANY COWS OF ANY AGE THAT 
EXHIBIT SUSPICIOUS SYMPTOMS. 
 
CROATIA BANS U.S. BEEF 
---------------------- 
 
4.  (U) IN A DECREE ISSUED DECEMBER 24 (WHICH WILL TAKE 
EFFECT WHEN PUBLISHED, PROBABLY ON DECEMBER 30), CROATIA 
ADDED THE UNITED STATES TO A LIST OF COUNTRIES FROM WHICH 
BEEF PRODUCT IMPORTS ARE BANNED.  THE LIST NOW NUMBERS 24, 
AND INCLUDES CANADA AND ALL EU MEMBERS EXCEPT FOR SWEDEN. 
BEEF, BOVINE EGG CELLS, BEEF BY-PRODUCTS, AND MEAL FROM BEEF 
PRODUCTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES ARE BANNED.  THE DECREE 
SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTS MILK, BOVINE SPERM AND EMBRYOS, GELATIN 
AND COLLAGEN (EXCEPT FROM PORTUGAL, IRELAND AND GREAT 
BRITAIN), AND BOVINE MATERIALS FOR PURELY INDUSTRIAL USE. 
THE DECREE ALSO EXEMPTS FOOD FOR CATS AND DOGS, AS LONG AS IT 
IS NOT FROM RUMINANTS, AND ANY RUMINANT-BASED RAW MATERIALS 
COME FROM A COUNTRY WHICH HAS NOT HAD ANY REGISTERED CASES OF 
BSE. 
 
EFFECTS ON US TRADE 
------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  THE U.S. DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPORT BEEF TO 
CROATIA, ALTHOUGH IT THEORETICALLY COULD (BEFORE THE DECREE) 
FROM ANY PLANT CERTIFIED TO EXPORT TO THE EU.  THE U.S. DID 
EXPORT APPROXIMATELY $518,000 WORTH OF PET FOOD TO CROATIA IN 
2002, AND U.S. BRANDS PRODUCED IN EUROPE AND EXPORTED TO 
CROATIA PROBABLY DO CONTAIN MANY U.S. INPUTS.  WE CONTACTED 
    MASTER FOODS, PROBABLY THE BIGGEST IMPORTER OF U.S. BRAND PET 
FOOD INTO CROATIA.  JASMINKA ILICIC, HEAD OF INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS, TOLD US THAT SHE EXPECTS THE BAN TO AFFECT THEIR 
IMPORTS IN THE MEDIUM-TERM.  FOR NOW, THE COMPANY HAS 
REQUESTED A WAIVER FROM THE GOC FOR PET FOOD PRODUCED BEFORE 
THE DATE OF THE BAN.  IT ASKED FOR AND RECEIVED A SIMILAR 
WAIVER WHEN CROATIA BANNED BEEF PRODUCT IMPORTS FROM CANADA. 
 
PRESS COVERAGE

SUBJECT: CROATIAN PRESIDENT MESIC: OK ON IRAQ TROOP 
CONTRIBUTIONS, WAIT ON ARTICLE 98, LIBYAN SHIP REFIT, TRIP 
TO SYRIA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank, reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (S) In the Ambassador\'s January 13 call on President Mesic 
to seek movement on key bilateral issues, Mesic offered to go 
slow for the time being on any contract to refit a Libyan 
naval vessel while restating his desire to develop commercial 
relations with Libya.  Mesic committed not to get in the way 
 
 VBI0878  SECURITY ERROR 
of moves by the new government to send Croatian troops to 
Iraq, but he remained concerned about the increased risk of 
terrorist attacks on Croatian tourist installations.  Mesic 
continued to balk at signing an Article 98 agreement until 
the ICTY has issued all indictments against Croatian 
citizens.  Mesic plans to visit Syria before the summer and 
asked for U.S. views on a possible meeting with Syrian 
President Asad (see comment paragraph 9).  Intelligence 
cooperation discussions will be reported septel.  End SUMMARY. 
 
Go Slow on Libya Ship Refit 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (S) The Ambassador called on President Stipe Mesic on 
January 13 to review core bilateral issues and set the tone 
for what we hope will be regular consultations.  Also 
attending the meeting were Presidential Foreign Policy 
Advisor Ambassador Mastruko, Assistant to the Foreign Policy 
Advisor Tomislav Car, and Poloff Justin Friedman (notetaker). 
 Ambassador Frank led the meeting by noting recent moves by 
Libya to come clean on its WMD programs and resolve the 
Lockerbie case.  However, the restoration of normal relations 
would need to wait until implementation of the agreement on 
WMD was verified and U.S. sanctions were lifted.  In the 
interim, the Ambassador urged that Croatia continue to hold 
off on any contract to refit the Libyan naval vessel 
Al-Munijed. 
 
3. (S) President Mesic responded that Libya was testing 
Croatia with this ship refit contract, and that $150 million 
in commercial contracts were contingent on this deal. 
However, Croatia understood U.S. concerns and would wait on 
consummating any refit deal by stalling the Libyans \"in the 
Arab way.\"  Mesic repeated Croatia\'s offer to allow U.S. 
intelligence access to the ship when it arrives in Croatian 
waters and offered that prospective Croatian contractors in 
Libya could also be exploited for intelligence purposes.  He 
said that he had good personal relations with Libyan leader 
Qadhafi, based in part on Qadhafi\'s deep admiration for 
deceased Yugoslav dictator Tito, as well as on Mesic\'s 
significant personal experience working in Libya.  Mesic said 
he had worked for many years in Libya during his days as 
chief of an engineering firm, including work on three 
separate 1000-person settlements along the Libya-Chad border, 
and had visited Libya officially previously when he held the 
rotating Yugoslav presidency.  Mesic noted that he had 
invited Qadhafi to visit Croatia, although no dates have been 
discussed. 
 
Won\'t Block Troops to Iraq 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Ambassador Frank turned the conversation to Iraq, 
commenting that a Croatian troop contribution to the 
coalition would be a significant gesture toward improving 
bilateral relations.  The Ambassador noted that UNSCR 1511 
specifically authorized the international military force in 
Iraq and urged member states to contribute to the military 
effort.  As recently as two weeks ago, Mesic had publicly 
commented that Croatia needed a further UN resolution 
authorizing military force before it could contribute troops. 
 Mesic further commented in the press that troop 
contributions would increase the risk of terrorist attacks in 
Croatia. 
 
5. (C) Mesic said that he agreed on our assessment of UNSCR 
1511, but countered that the coalition action \"was not a UN 
action.\"  However, Mesic agreed that Croatia should assist 
international efforts in Iraq to speed up Croatia\'s pace on 
the road to Euro-Atlantic integration.  Mesic said that he 
 
would not push for a troop contribution, but would not make 
any effort to block such a contribution if it received 
support in the Sabor.  He preferred that the contribution 
have a non-military profile, such as engineers, medical 
personnel, or even military police.  Mesic offered, however, 
that he would be in contact with the government and would not 
do anything to make Sabor approval more difficult.  (Comment: 
The required two-thirds majority in the Sabor for a 
deployment is problematic and a significant challenge for the 
HDZ-led government.  Nonetheless, Mesic\'s commitment is a 
positive development.  The Croatian armed forces have been 
training a small special forces unit for potential deployment 
to Iraq.) 
 
6. (C) President Mesic appeared surprised when the Ambassador 
noted that there had been no terrorist attacks on countries 
contributing troops to the Iraq coalition since the start of 
operations.  However, Mesic said he remained deeply concerned 
about the risk to Croatia\'s critical tourism industry of an 
attack on a hotel on the Adriatic coast. 
 
Wait on Article 98 
------------------ 
 
7. (C) Ambassador Frank urged President Mesic to support 
moves by the new government to seek an Article 98 agreement 
with the U.S.  He noted the importance of helping the 
Croatian public distinguish between the UN mandated ICTY and 
the ICC, which sought to assert jurisdiction over 
non-signatories like the U.S.  The Ambassador noted that 80 
countries, including other prospective EU members, had signed 
Article 98 agreements with the U.S. 
 
8. (C) President Mesic said he understood the U.S. position 
and reasons for seeking Article 98 agreements.  He agreed 
that the ICTY and ICC carried differently mandated 
obligations, but stressed the difficulties of conveying this 
distinction to the Croatian people who were victims of 
external aggression.  Mesic said that the ICTY performed a 
necessary role in Croatia of individualizing the guilt for 
war crimes committed by all sides.  He asked that the U.S. 
press the ICTY to issue all remaining indictments for 
Croatian citizens.  Once that was done, it would be easier 
for him to explain to the public the reasons for signing an 
Article 98 agreement with the U.S.  He added that once all 
Croatian indictees were in The Hague, Croatia could more 
easily sign an Article 98 agreement. 
 
Syria Visit 
----------- 
 
9. (C) Mesic asked what U.S. views would be if he were to 
meet with Syrian President Bashar al Asad.  He said that he 
was looking to visit the Middle East some time before the 
summer, and stops would include Syria, Qatar, Oman, and 
Jordan.  Mesic noted that the petroleum exploration Croatian 
firm Crosco (a subsidiary of INA) had taken over leases from 
U.S. firms of some gas and oil fields in Syria, and these 
were turning into major finds.  Several hundred Croatian 
citizens were now working in Syria, and Mesic felt it 
important that he visit them.  (Comment: We will seek 
guidance from Washington closer to the date of the trip on 
specific points that Mesic could use with Al-Asad if 
appropriate.)

SUBJECT: PROPOSALS FOR BIOTECH EDUCATION ACTIVITIES 
 
REF: A) FAS WASHDC 663775  B) 03 ZAGREB 2224 
 
1.  In response to ref A, Mission proposes the following 
biotech outreach activities: 
 
-- placement of biotech articles targeted for Central 
European market, especially those by European authors. 
 
-- funding to help promote local pro-biotech organizations. 
 
-- organize trips for regulators to EU countries that are 
relatively pro-biotech, e.g., Spain, to see their approval 
process. 
 
-- funding to support travel of Croatian biotech 
stakeholders and journalists to U.S. and to Europe, for 
international conferences and to meet pro-biotech groups 
(currently, anti-biotech NGOs fund travel to meet with 
anti-GMO speakers and groups). 
 
2.  Target Markets: 
 
The U.S. has export growth potential in the following 
markets, which would be stymied by anti-biotech attitudes 
and legislation: 
 
-- soybeans 
-- processed food that contains soybeans and corn 
-- feed that contains soybeans and corn 
 
3.  Current Conditions in the Targeted Markets - affecting 
the intended commodity or product: 
 
-- FAS Zagreb will email table containing details of 
imports to Croatia from World and U.S. for the targeted 
commodities to FAS/ICD and FAS/OA/BIG.  In 2002 the U.S. 
exported approximately $1 million in course grains, $1 
million in soybean meal, $1 million each in non-nut snack 
foods, breakfast cereal and pet food, and $7 million in 
other consumer-oriented products. 
 
-- Please see ref B for details of Croatian legislation 
regarding biotech.  In brief, a framework of laws has been 
enacted that in theory will allow the import and 
cultivation of biotech products, under heavy regulation. 
How these laws will be implemented will in great part 
depend on how the public perceives the risk of biotech 
products. 
 
4.  Project Objectives: 
 
To open the door for U.S. products in Croatian market by: 
 
-- demonstrating that Croatia can be \"European,\" risk- 
adverse, environmentally sensitive and use biotech at the 
same time. 
 
-- convincing consumers, regulators and politicians that 
biotech is safe. 
 
5.  Performance Measures: 
 
Changes in market accessibility for mentioned products, to 
be measured by: 
 
-- increased number of neutral or positive press reports on 
television and in print; 
 
-- first approvals for biotech products 
 
6.  Rationale: 
 
This market could close for almost all food products 
containing even traces of \"GMOs.\"  In the future, the 
Croatian model may be followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina 
and other countries in the region, increasing the injury to 
U.S. exporters and local consumers.  We need not only 
to communicate the safety of this technology and 
quality of U.S. products, we need to \"Europeanize\" 
biotech.  Currently, biotech is seen in Croatia as an 
American imposition.  Anti-biotech forces continually 
say they are following the \"European way,\" which to 
their minds means no-GMOs.  We need to show that biotech 
has been used in Europe for years, and that there 
are pro-biotech countries and forces in Europe. 
Activities will probably not have an immediate, 
 
obvious impact but over time they should create a more 
balanced Croatian position about biotechnology, openness to 
consumer choice, and allow U.S. products to re-enter the 
market.

SUMMARY and COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. (C) In an introductory call on new Minister of Justice 
Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, Ambassador Frank welcomed the Minister\'s 
positive statements on cooperation with the ICTY and urged 
quick resolution of the Gotovina case.  The Ambassador 
praised achievements in reforming the State Prosecutor\'s 
office under Chief State Prosecutor Mladen Bajic, and 
stressed the need for comparable judicial reforms. 
Skare-Ozbolt laid out her four-point plan for thorough 
judicial reforms and committed on refugee returns to \"fully 
protect private property.\"  Skare-Ozbolt brings a burst of 
new energy to a lackadaisical Ministry, but will face an 
uphill battle to convince the judiciary to go along with her 
reforms.  However, our new assistance program to help improve 
local capacity to prosecute war crimes cases will benefit 
from this new momentum for change.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
ICTY Cooperation Key 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) Ambassador Frank paid an introductory call on Minister 
of Justice Vesna Skare-Ozbolt on January 23.  Also 
participating were Assistant Minister Zdravko Stojanovic, 
PolOff Justin Friedman, and USAIDOff Chuck Howell.  The 
Ambassador welcomed the commitment of the new government to 
cooperate fully with the ICTY.  However, the U.S. was deeply 
concerned by comments in the press by Sabor President 
Vladimir Seks indicating the U.S. had not discussed the 
Gotovina case on Seks\'s and Foreign Minster Zuzul\'s recent 
visit to Washington.  The Ambassador stressed that resolution 
of the Gotovina case was an important part of the Washington 
discussions and that he had spoken to Prime Minister Sanader 
that morning about the GoC correcting any public 
misperceptions created by the Sabor President\'s statements. 
Skare-Ozbolt noted this comment reaffirmed her government\'s 
commitment to cooperate fully with the ICTY.  Later the same 
day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement 
retracting Seks\'s comments. 
 
Judicial Reform High Priority 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Ambassador Frank praised reforms achieved by State 
Prosecutor Mladen Bajic in his office and challenged Minister 
Skare-Ozbolt to achieve similar reforms in the judiciary. 
Skare-Ozbolt agreed with the Ambassador\'s comment that 
judicial reforms were also necessary to improve investor 
confidence in Croatia.  She said she planned to keep in place 
existing programs to improve court performance, including the 
USAID, World Bank, EU funded municipal court automation 
program, while improving on their implementation. 
 
4. (C) Minister Skare-Ozbolt said she would implement a 
four-point plan to tackle the serious problems still facing 
the judicial sector.  First, she plans to move judicial 
training programs from the ineffective Center for Judicial 
Education and create a new Judicial Academy in cooperation 
with the Zagreb Law School.  There, prospective and current 
judges would receive additional training to encourage 
individual courts to specialize in areas such as family law 
or commercial law. 
 
5. (C) Second, to help remove the 1.5 million court case 
backlog, Minister Skare-Ozbolt will introduce legislation 
allowing cases to be transferred between courts, noting that 
sixty percent of the backlog is in the Zagreb and Split 
courts.  She also plans to create new criminal and civil 
courts as well as a land registry court for Zagreb, having 
already identified facilities to be renovated for this 
purpose. 
 
6. (C) Third, Minister Skare-Ozbolt plans to fund the hiring 
of 550 new court counselors (equivalent to U.S. clerks) who 
would help judges manage administrative matters, draft 
decisions, and even handle simple cases directly.  These 
counselors would all be bar-approved lawyers, who could use 
these positions to demonstrate their suitability to become 
judges.  Finally, some laws, including aspects of the 
criminal code changes annulled by the Constitutional Court 
(ref A), would be changed to improve court efficiency. 
 
7. (C) Minister Skare-Ozbolt also pointed to implementation 
of alternative dispute resolution legislation and better 
 
E 
 
 
training of government officials on when to use courts to 
improve the efficiency of the court system.  With these 
measures, Minister Skare-Ozbolt expects to resolve the case 
backlog in three to five years. 
 
Support Refugee Returns 
----------------------- 
 
8. (C) Ambassador Frank welcomed commitments by Prime 
Minister Sanader to promote the return of refugees to 
Croatia, noting the role of the Ministry of Justice would be 
critical in this effort.  Minister Skare-Ozbolt said she had 
considerable experience on the challenges involved from her 
previous experience working on the peaceful reintegration of 
the Slavonia region into Croatia but committed to \"fully 
protect private property.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Minister Skare-Ozbolt\'s energy, apparent commitment, 
and engagement on the issues of judicial reform and refugee 
return are a welcome change from her predecessor.  Minister 
Skare-Ozbolt also indicated that she wanted to see clinical 
legal education more widely introduced in Croatia.  While we 
sense a new energy and direction from her Ministry staff as 
well, her key challenge will be to convince deeply 
conservative judiciary and law school faculties to accept 
considerable changes to the way they do their jobs.  We have 
supported such efforts in the past with limited success, but 
have a declining ability to support new efforts as SEED 
funding dries up. 
 
10. (C) Over the last year, the GoC has made uneven progress 
in improving its ability to prosecute war crimes cases 
domestically (ref B).  Post will seek to leverage new War 
Crimes Court assistance funds (ref C) with Minister 
Skare-Ozbolt\'s commitment to implement court system reforms, 
as well as EU judicial education programs now in place.

MINISTER -- FROM HIV/AIDS TO NATO 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank, reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) In his introductory meeting with Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Health Andrija Hebrang, the 
Ambassador emphasized USG desire to help Croatia in the area 
of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, our appreciation for 
the support of the new government to ratify the Intellectual 
Property MOU, concern over delays faced by US companies 
registering drugs in Croatia, and the interest of U.S. 
companies in upgrading of Croatia\'s aging hospital 
infrastructure.  Hebrang expressed his admiration for U.S. 
medicine, highlighted the \"new\" HDZ, and appealed for our 
support for Croatia\'s NATO bid.  He promised to look into the 
drug registration issue, and flagged an \"open issue\" 
regarding the IP MOU.  End Summary. 
 
Affinity for U.S. 
----------------- 
 
2.  (U) On January 27, the Ambassador met with Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Health Andrija Hebrang, accompanied 
by the Senior Commercial Counselor, USAID officer and a 
notetaker.  The Ambassador congratulated Hebrang on being 
named Health Minister and one of only two Deputy Prime 
Ministers.  He thanked Hebrang for his assistance to the U.S. 
Embassy shortly after September 11 (Hebrang, a radiologist, 
helped the Embassy access decontamination equipment after the 
anthrax attacks in the U.S.). 
 
3.  (U) Hebrang noted the importance of the U.S. to Croatia, 
and his own very positive personal experiences with the U.S. 
(Hebrang spent time in the U.S. as a visiting professor in 
1988.)  He believed the best place to learn medicine was in 
the U.S., and he asked that the Embassy facilitate training 
in the U.S. and university-to-university exchanges. 
Regarding the war on terrorism, Croatia was proud to have 
been part of the coalition and would continue to a partner to 
the U.S. 
 
HIV/AIDS -- Need for Political Leadership 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) The Ambassador highlighted U.S. cooperation with 
Croatia in the health area.  In addition to work in various 
public health areas with NGOs, the USG was the largest single 
donor to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. 
Croatia has a two-year, $3.3 million dollar agreement with 
the Fund.  The Ambassador underscored the U.S.\'s worldwide 
commitment to combatting AIDS.  Experts believe that the next 
wave of the epidemic could be in Southeast Europe.  While 
Croatia has a low incidence of HIV infection (about 0.02 
percent), as a transit country, international experts were 
concerned that this number could rise.  Political leadership 
was needed to strengthen primary prevention, to curb 
discrimination and stigmatization, and to boost cross-border 
cooperation and information exchange.  The Ambassador urged 
Hebrang to use his position to speak publicly in support of 
HIV/AIDS victims and in favor of prevention programs. 
 
5.  (SBU) Hebrang recognized that, as an open country and a 
tourist destination, Croatia\'s HIV infection rate could 
increase.  He was dedicated to education and prevention. 
 
Pharmaceutical Issues 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) The Ambassador expressed his appreciation for the 
Sanader government\'s commitment to ratify soon the 1998 MOU 
on Intellectual Property Rights.  In response, Hebrang raised 
an \"open issue\" with respect to the MOU.  He understood there 
was some question among Croatian drug producers about the 
period they could produce affected drugs after ratification 
of the MOU.  The Ambassador said that we would be happy to 
clarify any technical questions once they were clearly 
identified. 
 
7.  (SBU) The Ambassador also called to Hebrang\'s attention 
the unacceptably long registration periods U.S. 
pharmaceutical firms faced when trying to market their 
products in Croatia -- far in excess of the time limits 
established under Croatian law.  The USG was hosting a 
regional conference on Pharmaceutical Regulation in Skopje in 
March, as part of our effort to help build capacity in the 
Croatian Drug Agency.  Hebrang expressed his surprise about 
the registration delays and pledged to talk to the Drug 
Agency head about the issue. 
 
 
8.  (SBU) The Ambassador highlighted two health care projects 
about which U.S. companies had expressed interest -- a new 
hospital information system and outsourcing of services at a 
Zagreb hospital.  The U.S. Trade and Development Agency had 
been approached by IBM to explore supporting a pilot project 
for the Hospital Information System.  With the change in 
government, IBM had the impression that the project might be 
on hold or withdrawn. 
 
9.  (U) Hebrang explained that upgrading Croatia\'s hospitals 
-- most of which were over 40 years old -- and hospital 
systems were a high priority.  Both projects that the 
Ambassador mentioned were going forward.  Hebrang said U.S. 
companies would be welcomed in the health sector\'s 
rejuvenation. 
 
NATO 
---- 
 
10.  (C) Hebrang bracketed the meeting with appeals for US 
support for Croatia\'s NATO bid.  With Croatia a member 
neither of the EU nor of NATO, it was in a \"Balkan hole.\" 
The Ambassador stressed that Croatia had to make real changes 
and reforms and appeared to have made a good start.  FM Zuzul 
and Parliament Speaker Seks\' trip to the U.S. had been 
positive.  The \"house cleaning\" performed by the current HDZ 
leadership had been essential to its credibility.  Hebrang 
echoed the importance of creating a \"new HDZ.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (C) Hebrang was personable and open.  As a former 
Minister of Health during the Tudjman era, he has been able 
to jump quickly and authoritatively into health care issues 
-- calling the former government to task for racking up 
arrears and debts to suppliers (contacts in and out of the 
government say his charges are probably well-founded). 
However, he definitely sees his role as much more than a 
Health Minister.  As a senior member of the HDZ, Hebrang was 
rumored to be seeking a security or foreign affairs 
portfolio, but his penchant for rash statements, propensity 
to clash with President Mesic, and his defense of late 
ICTY-indictee General Bobetko put him at odds with many -- 
including the EU -- and with the modern, more moderate image 
of Sanader\'s HDZ.  In recognition of his strength within the 
party and his ability to deliver votes, he was awarded one of 
the two deputy prime minister slots, in charge of economic 
issues.  We have yet to see how Hebrang plans to manage this 
important porfolio, in which other ministers and advisors 
play major and perhaps overlapping roles.

SUBJECT: FASCISM FALLS OUT OF FASHION IN CROATIA 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please Treat Accordingly 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Until relatively recently, expressions of extreme 
nationalism were considered acceptable in Croatia\'s political 
and social dialogue.  That seems to be changing.  Croatians 
have gotten the message that extreme nationalism is 
incompatible with their ambitions of accession to 
Euro-Atlantic institutions.  In stark contrast to election 
results in Serbia, held about the same time, only a few of 
Croatia\'s most extreme nationalists won seats in the new 
parliament.  The jingoist balladeer Marko Perkovic \"Thompson\" 
has been ostracized for hate speech which would have been 
acceptable to many in Croatia less than two years ago.  PM 
Sanader\'s HDZ courted and won the support of the ethnic Serb 
party in parliament, which would have been unthinkable under 
former President Tudjman.  Sanader has also made a clear 
gesture acknowledging culpability of Croatia\'s WWII-era 
fascist regime in the Holocaust.  It is certain that extreme 
nationalist sentiment is still a factor in Croatia, but the 
general recognition that it is nothing to be proud of is a 
step forward.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) When the Tudjman-era HDZ was ejected from power in 
January 2000, most voters cited corruption and financial 
mismanagement, not a rejection of extreme nationalism, as 
their motivation for change.  Ironically, the event that 
served to bring most Croatians to the realization that 
expressions of extremism were damaging to their interests was 
a surge of nationalist fervor brought on by the ICTY 
indictment of retired General Janko Bobetko in the Autumn of 
2002. 
 
Croatia Chooses Europe, Not Nationalism 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) The Racan government dithered for months about 
whether it dared to serve the ICTY indictment on the aged, 
ailing General Bobetko whom the right had dubbed a \"hero\" of 
Croatia\'s war of independence.  Throughout the \"crisis\" -- 
which PM Racan claimed brought Croatia close to real civil 
unrest -- the international community maintained a firm line: 
either cooperate with ICTY or abandon aspirations of 
integration with NATO and the EU.  Bobetko died before he 
could be transferred to The Hague, but the stalemate dragged 
on long enough for the wave of emotional response to pass and 
for most Croatians to decide that they were ready to 
sacrifice one of their symbols for a future in Europe. 
 
Cleaning out the HDZ 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The HDZ, long the standard-bearer of Croatian 
nationalism, was during the Bobetko \"crisis\" completing its 
own transformation, although some skeptics still believe this 
transformation is largely superficial.  Ivo Sanader first 
defeated Tudjman henchman Ivic Pasalic in a bruising battle 
for the party presidency and then began a systematic purge of 
Pasalic\'s supporters.  Together with Miroslav Tudjman, the 
son and spitting image of his father, Pasalic founded a new 
political party to be a home for nationalist HDZ members 
disaffected by Sanader\'s more centrist political message. 
 
The \"Thompson\" Phenomenon 
------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) While Pasalic expected some of his support to come 
from HDZ hardliners, he also counted on an apparent 
resurgence of extreme nationalism among younger Croatians for 
new strength.  The popular singer Marko Perkovic -- known as 
\"Thompson\" (after the submachine gun) to his fans -- was 
packing in huge crowds in the Summer and Fall of 2002 to hear 
jingoist ballads laced with references paying homage to 
Croatia\'s WWII-era fascist state, known as the \"Ustashe.\" 
Tens of thousands of Croatians too young to have served in 
the \"Homeland War\" brazenly displayed \"Ustashe\" symbols and 
shouted anti-Serb slogans at a series of \"Thompson\" concerts. 
 
 
Nationalism Fails at Croatian Polls 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) In the Spring of 2003, when political parties began 
positioning themselves for elections later that year, Sanader 
strategically staked out the center-right, declaring that, if 
elected, an HDZ government would be committed to Croatia\'s 
integration into Europe, even at the cost of cooperating with 
ICTY.  When elections came around on November 23, voters 
responded.  Poll results show that some of the HDZ 
nationalists drifted away to the hardline Croatian Party of 
Right (HSP), but Pasalic\'s anti-Europe, anti-ICTY message got 
 
nowhere; his party won not a single seat while Sanader\'s HDZ 
won nearly half the seats in the new Sabor.  The HSP won a 
total of eight seats, a good result for the HSP as a party, 
but a sound defeat for extreme nationalism in Croatia. 
Croatian political columnists were quick to point out how 
this result contrasted with recent parliamentary elections in 
Serbia. 
 
Sanader\'s HDZ In Coalition With Serbs 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Sanader stunned Europeans skeptical of his centrist 
vocation when he inked a deal with the new parliament\'s 
ethnic Serb party, the SDSS.  In exchange for their three 
votes, the SDSS got a pledge to speed the processes of 
refugee return and restitution of property expropriated from 
Serbs displaced during the war.  While the new government has 
yet to produce results on the difficult issue of refugee 
returns, Sanader\'s effort to reach out to Serbs has made even 
his most skeptical critics sit up and take notice. 
 
8.  (SBU) \"Thompson\" has fared even worse than Pasalic.  A 
free speech NGO recently posted a transcript from a live 
version of one of Thompson\'s ballads.  In the plain light of 
day, Thompson\'s vile hate speech has turned the stomachs of 
most Croatians.  Croatia\'s PEN Center has long been a critic 
of Thompson, but on January 24, even the Croatian Bishops\' 
Council -- which from time to time still disputes the extent 
of the Holocaust in Croatia -- sharply criticized his \"hate 
speech and glorification of crimes.\"  President Mesic, who 
continues to bear the standard for Croatians who oppose 
extremism, condemned Thompson\'s lyrics as \"shameful\" and 
wondered how people who support fascist ideals could still 
exist in Croatia.  The recent arrest of a Zagreb street 
vendor of parephernalia bearing \"Ustashe\" symbols shows how 
much things have changed. 
 
Sanader Gesture at Holocaust Commemoration 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9.  (SBU) In preparation for Croatia\'s January 27 
commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day, Sanader made an 
appearance and an appropriate statement -- together with 
President Mesic -- at an exhibit of photographs which paid 
homage to victims of the Holocaust.  While this was a 
continuation of former PM Racan\'s recognition of Croatian 
culpability in the Holocaust, it marked another departure 
from the practice of Tudjman\'s HDZ. 
 
10.  (SBU) Extreme nationalism is still present in Croatia, 
but its blatant expression is no longer acceptable in public. 
 All of Croatia\'s responsible political leaders recognize 
that extreme nationalism is incompatible with Croatia\'s bid 
for NATO and EU membership.  It seems to us that Croatia\'s 
voters -- whether they voted for the HDZ or its political 
opponents -- made a conscious choice to move forward, even if 
it means sacrificing some of its nationalist icons -- such as 
ICTY indictee Ante Gotovina.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) On January 30, the Ambassador reviewed with Jadranka 
Kosor, Deputy Prime Minister, Croatia\'s record on trafficking 
in persons (TIP).  Kosor acknowledged that Croatia will need 
to address the issue better, but otherwise offered little in 
substance other than to declare that she will be our point of 
contact on TIP.  The new GOC is still organizing itself on 
this issue, but we have raised TIP at the highest levels to 
highlight its importance to the USG, and the need for Croatia 
to take action against trafficking.  End Summary.

2. (SBU) On January 30, the Ambassador raised the issue of 
TIP in his initial courtesy call with Jadranka Kosor, Deputy 
Prime Minister, and Minister for Family, Veterans Affairs,

concerned about the Government\'s lack of implementation of 
its National Action Plan to suppress trafficking in persons. 
Kosor indicated her desire to work closely with us on 
anti-trafficking programs and activities. 
 
The MFA\'s New Found Interest 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) On January 29, we met Andrea Bekic, MFA Desk Officer 
for the US, to discuss Croatia\'s efforts, or lack thereof, to 
combat TIP in Croatia.  Bekic expressed concern that Croatia 
may be moved from Tier 2 to Tier 3 on the annual TIP report. 
She wanted to know our intentions, as well as what Croatia 
must do to demonstrate that it is vigorously working to 
eliminate all forms of TIP.  We reviewed with Bekic the 
benchmarks (Ref A) that we delivered to the MFA and 
Government Human Rights Office in August 2003 (Ref B), and 
discussed additional measures -- such as organizational 
reforms, and additional funding -- that Croatia could take 
now to begin much needed implementation of the National 
Action Plan. 
 
4. (C) We learned later from the local office of the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) that the MFA 
is arguing within the government that the Government Office 
for Human Rights should be disbanded.  Presumably most of 
what the Human Rights Office considers its \"competencies\" -- 
such as attending international conferences and \"cooperating\" 
with the international community -- would fall to the MFA. 
IOM also told us that the chair of the Croatian Helsinki 
Committee met with Kosor immediately following her 
appointment, and told her the Head of the Government Office 
for Human Rights must be replaced.  In our meetings with 
Human Rights Office staff, there is clear unease and 
uncertainty about the future of the office.  We have made the 
point in our meetings with GOC interlocutors that 
coordination and cooperation is necessary and good, but the 
new government must begin to take action soon to implement 
anti-trafficking activities. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) The new government is still in the early stages of 
filling positions and assigning responsibilities, but we have 
focused the new Government early on TIP as an important USG 
interest, and confirmed that we expect the GOC to implement 
the former government\'s National Action Plan to combat 
trafficking.  The Ambassador raised TIP in his initial 
meetings with the Prime Minister, who demonstrated a 
familiarity with the issue and promised to provide us with a 
point of contact for further discussion.  The meeting with 
Deputy Prime Minister Kosor focused almost exclusively on 
TIP, and she twice told the Ambassador that she is our point 
of contact on TIP-related issues, although she had little of 
substance to say during the Ambassador\'s January 30 meeting 
with her.  Bekic\'s eagerness to meet on TIP may indicate an 
expanded willingness on the part of the MFA to be involved on 
the issue.  Previously only the MFA\'s Department of Human 
Rights engaged with us on TIP, and then mostly for the 
 
purpose of challenging the basis on which Croatia was 
included in the Department\'s annual TIP report (Ref C, para 
9c).

OF THE MFA\'S AMERICAS DEPARTMENT, ANDREA BEKIC, HANDED US A

THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 
PRESENTS ITS COMPLIMENTS TO THE EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA IN ZAGREB AND HAS THE HONOUR TO PRESENT THE 
CANDIDATURE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA FOR THE NON-PERMANENT 
SEAT TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF THE UNITED NATIONS FOR THE 
PERIOD 2008-2009 AT ELECTIONS TO BE HELD DURING THE 62ND 
SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN 2007 
IN NEW YORK. 
 
CROATIA STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE UN PRINCIPLES OF EQUITABLE 
REPRESENTATION OF REGIONS AND ROTATION IN THE MEMBERSHIP OF 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION. IN THIS RESPECT AND CONSIDERING 
THE FACT THAT CROATIA HAS NEVER BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL, THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA WOULD HIGHLY APPRECIATE IF 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WOULD RENDER ITS VALUABLE 
SUPPORT FOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED CANDIDATURE. 
 
TO DATE, CROATIA HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF UN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
COUNCIL (ECOSOC) AND SERVED ON EIGHT OF ITS FUNCTIONAL 
COMMISSIONS, CULMINATING IN THE PRESIDENCY OF ECOSOC IN 2002. 
MINDFUL THAT PEACE AND SECURITY ARE PREREQUISITES FOR 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROSPERITY, CROATIA WOULD LIKE TO REMAIN 
ENGAGED WITH AND RESPONSIVE TO CURRENT CONCERNS ON REFORMING 
    THE UN SYSTEM, IN ORDER TO MAKE IT A STRONGER AND MORE 
EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. 
 
GIVEN THE SECURITY COUNCIL,S PRIMARY ROLE IN THE MAINTENANCE 
OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY, A CENTRAL TENET OF 
CROATIA,S CANDIDATURE FOR SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP IS ITS 
WISH TO ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE UN SYSTEM OF COLLECTIVE 
SECURITY IN EFFECTIVE AND TRANSPARENT WAY, AS EMBODIED IN THE 
CHARTER AND RE-ALIGNED WITH THE MILLENNIUM DECLARATION. 
CROATIA GAINED IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE IN POST-WAR RECOVERY, 
POST-CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND CONFIDENCE BUILDING. CROATIA 
CONTINUES TO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO CONFLICT PREVENTION 
AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION ACTIVITIES, AND TAKES AN ACTIVE PART 
IN A NUMBER OF UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS. IN ITS ROLE OF THE 
PROMOTER OF REGIONAL AND EUROPEAN SECURITY, CROATIA STANDS 
DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PEACE EFFORTS AND A 
STRENGTHENED UN ROLE ON A REGIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVEL. 
 
THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 
AVAILS ITSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RENEW TO THE EMBASSY OF 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN ZAGREB THE ASSURANCES OF ITS 
HIGHEST CONSIDERATION.

SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR MEETS MARITIME,           TOURISM,TRANSPORT AND DEVELOPMENT MINISTER 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  Bozidar Kalmeta, Croatia\'s Minister of Maritime, 
Tourism, Transport and Development, said in his February 9 
introductory meeting with the Ambassador that 
reconstruction of returning Serbs\' homes and road building 
would be his two top priorities.  The government would 
consider giving Bechtel a contract to participate in 
building a highway from Split to Dubrovnik.  It also 
intends to continue modernization of the Croatian railroads 
and liberalize the telecommunications market.  In tourism, 
the GOC would seek to raise the quality of service by 
privatizing hotels to brand-name investors.  A joint 
project with the World Bank has been started to treat 
wastewater in coastal cities.  Kalmeta would like to see 
creation of an American-style Coast Guard.  Despite these 
numerous challenges, Kalmeta\'s business-mindedness inspires 
optimism.  End summary. 
 
Reconstruction 
-------------- 
 
2.  Croatia\'s new Minister for Maritime Affairs, Tourism, 
Transport and Development, Bozidar Kalmeta, said at his 
February 9 introductory meeting with the Ambassador that 
reconstruction of the remaining 5,000 houses for which 
reconstruction applications were outstanding -- 80 percent 
of which was ethnic-Serb owned property -- was his 
ministry\'s top priority.  He estimated that this effort 
would cost about 1.3 billion kuna (approx. 215 million 
dollars) and would be completed by the spring of 2005. 
Kalmeta praised his team working on reconstruction, led by 
his State Secretary for development, Zdravko Livakovic, and 
including an ethnic Serb assistant minister, Milan Janjic 
of the Serb Democratic Forum (SDF).  Revitalizing the 
economy in the war-affected areas will be part of the 
reconstruction effort.  Kalmeta said the government was 
preparing a new law on Areas of Special State Interest, 
which would include additional economic incentives for 
these areas. 
 
Transportation Infrastructure 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  Kalmeta identified construction of infrastructure as 
the second highest priority of his ministry.  The 
government will continue the same pace of road building as 
the previous one.  Referring to a meeting he had had the 
same day with Bechtel representatives, the Prime Minister 
and the Foreign Minister, Kalmeta said the government would 
consider Bechtel as the contractor for the new highway from 
Split to Dubrovnik.  An important condition would be heavy 
involvement of Croatian companies in the project.  Bechtel 
representatives, who allegedly voiced readiness to include 
Croatians in up to 70 percent of the job, would send back a 
concrete proposal in a matter of days.  In addition to this 
Adriatic-Ionic corridor, the GOC was also interested in the 
5C corridor running from the Hungarian to the Bosnian 
border, as well as convincing the Slovenes to build their 
own portions of the highways connecting Croatia with Italy 
and Austria, respectively.  Kalmeta asked for USG help with 
the Slovene government about this issue. 
 
4.  The government intends to continue with the 2003-2007 
Railroad Modernization Plan as enacted by the previous 
government.  To achieve this, the government would have to 
spend 15 billion kuna ($2.5 billion), part of which would 
be collected through a gasoline tax. 
 
Telecommunications 
------------------ 
 
5.  Despite resistance from the existing telecom firms to 
allowing more networks of fixed and mobile telephony, 
Kalmeta supported the liberalization of the 
telecommunications sector.  Competition would eventually 
bring down the prices of telephone services, which were 
among the highest in Europe, Kalmeta said.  Also, new 
concessionaires would create from 1 to 1.5 thousand jobs, 
and contribute at least 170 million kuna to the state 
budget. 
 
Tourism 
------- 
 
6.  As for tourism, Kalmeta supported quick privatization 
of the remaining 30 hotel companies, which owned a much 
greater number of hotels.  He favored foreign brand-name 
investors that would significantly raise the quality of 
accommodations.  Kalmeta singled out Istria as a region 
 
 
whose approach to tourism was serious, systematic and which 
recognized that tourism was a long-term investment.  As far 
as the rest of Croatia was concerned, tourism was handled 
in an \"amateurish\" way.  Kalmeta mentioned that the 
government engaged with the World Bank in a $240 million 
project to manage wastewater in the coastal cities.  Zadar 
and Opatija were the first towns to start the project. 
 
Coast Guard 
----------- 
 
7.  Kalmeta liked the idea of a Coast Guard as it exists in 
the U.S.  His ministry was drafting legislation to 
establish such a Coast Guard and welcomed U.S assistance 
and experience in this matter. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  Kalmeta\'s gigantic ministry came as a result of merging 
three ministries into one.  While highly talented -- 
Kalmeta was described during the election campaign as 
Croatia\'s most \"successful mayor\" -- the Zadar native is 
still trying to determine where his huge portfolio ends. 
His public works and reconstruction predecessor, Radimir 
Cacic, a bullish and determined businessman, left some big 
shoes to fill.  To a large extent, the government\'s 
performance will be measured by Kalmeta\'s achievements, 
both domestically (tourism and road building) and 
internationally (return and reconstruction).  Despite this 
pressure, Kalmeta strikes us as a capable manager, rather 
than a politician, who is on top of his portfolio and whose 
eye is set on results.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PREL, HR, Trade 
SUBJECT: NEW FINANCE MINISTER TALKS FISCAL DISCIPLINE 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified -- please protect accordingly. 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) The Ambassador met new Finance Minister Ivan Suker 
February 10.  Suker declared the government\'s intention to 
negotiate a new Standby Arrangement with the IMF -- 
apparently EU pressure caused the government to overcome 
earlier misgivings about another SBA.  Such an agreement 
would mean crafting a restrictive budget.  Suker emphasized 
fiscal discipline first, tax cuts second.  The Ambassador 
reviewed various USG assistance projects and asked for more 
feedback to make them more effective.  Suker, a former mayor, 
emphasized the importance of strong financing mechanisms at 
the local level.  End Summary. 
 
\"Dedicated to new Standby Arrangement\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Suker began the February 10 meeting with the 
Ambassador by noting that he was embroiled in tough 
negotiations with various ministries in an attempt to put a 
budget together (the government has until the end of March to 
put together its first budget -- it is currently operating on 
a provisional budget passed by the last government).  He 
believed that this first budget would demonstrate to the 
international community and to the financial markets the HDZ 
government\'s seriousness. 
 
3.  (SBU) Suker highlighted the government\'s intention to 
pursue a Standby Arrangement with a target budget deficit of 
4.5-4.8 percent of GDP (this would be far above the 3.8 
percent the last government agreed with the IMF for this 
year).  He argued that the last government had \"achieved\" a 
budget deficit of 4.8 percent -- far below the target of 6.7 
percent -- in 2002 only by failing to fulfill commitments. 
While the figures are not yet official (or even public), the 
previous government had NOT met its 4.5 percent target for 
2003; he believed the figure was 5.8 percent.  Thus, 4.5-4.8 
percent this year would represent real discipline.  \"We will 
need to say \'no\' to a lot of spending.\"  The Ambassador noted 
that he had just met with the Minister of Transportation, who 
had a lot of ambitious -- and expensive -- projects. 
Preparing for NATO would also not be a cheap endeavor. 
 
Tax Cuts to Wait 
---------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Suker also said that tax reform could come only 
after deficit reduction.  Suker did not even mention one of 
the HDZ\'s most important campaign promises -- VAT reduction 
-- but rather stressed the importance of lowering the cost of 
labor (i.e., payroll taxes) to stimulate employment. 
 
5.  (SBU) Suker highlighted the need to bring order to 
government finances -- he would begin by sorting out the 
Treasury function in the Ministry.  Transparency would also 
be a focus. 
 
Leadership Needed to Make Assistance Work 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) The Ambassador explained that, in the last 
government, the Mission had found the Ministry often 
unresponsive.  Given the appointment of so many evidently 
competent people to the Ministry, we looked forward to a 
better relationship, particularly in implementing our 
assistance programs.  Many of our programs were designed to 
achieve just what the Minister had identified as his 
principle goal -- getting a grip on finances.  Much of our 
assistance to the Ministry was coming to an end in September. 
 To maximize its effectiveness, we wished to work closely 
with Ministry, especially in the areas of continuing to 
implement a new financial information management system and 
the area of fiscal decentralization. 
 
7.  (SBU) Suker noted that as a mayor until the end of last 
year, he had seen how localities should not and could not 
rely on the central government.  He remarked on the need to 
simplify and streamline the patchwork of taxes and fees and 
to improve the management of infrastructure -- areas where 
U.S. assistance can help. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Suker -- an ex-mayor and tax collector -- sounded 
the right notes on the need for fiscal discipline.  He may 
 
find the IMF a good stick with which to beat his fellow 
ministers, as he tries to ratchet down the deficit.  However, 
the IMF will likely demand, at least as a starting position, 
more ambitious deficit reduction than that contemplated by 
the government --- we understand in the neighborhood of 4.0 
percent.  Meanwhile, the pensioners are getting restless, the 
Ministry of Defense needs to invest in NATO preparedness, and 
the ambitious Minister of Transportation has plans for roads, 
bridges, railroads and a new Coast Guard.  It is unclear to 
us that Suker has the political weight to push back against 
more politically influential ministers.  Only the interest of 
the EU in Croatia continuing with an SBA has brought the 
government this far; at some point the government will have 
to balance constituencies against IMF and EU pressure.

SUBJECT: CROATIA TRYING TO CONVINCE UK IT IS COOPERATING 
WITH ICTY 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: DCM PATRICK S. MOON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
    SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) THE UK MAY BE EASING THE CRITERIA BY WHICH IT WILL 
MEASURE CROATIA\'S COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL 
TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY).  IN ADVANCE OF A 
FEBRUARY 11 VISIT BY FM ZUZUL TO LONDON, A BRITISH EMBASSY 
OFFICER INFORMED US THAT IF PM SANADER MAKES A CLEAR PUBLIC 
STATEMENT OF HIS GOVERNMENT\'S INTENT TO ARREST AND TRANSFER 
ICTY PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA AND MAKES KEY CHANGES TO SENIOR 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE PERSONNEL, HMG WOULD AGREE TO MOVE 
FORWARD WITH THE RATIFICATION PROCESS OF CROATIA\'S 
STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (SAA) WITH THE 
EUROPEAN UNION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) FROM FEBRUARY 11 - 12, CROATIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
MIOMIR ZUZUL VISITED LONDON TO URGE FORWARD PROGRESS TOWARD 
UK RATIFICATION OF CROATIA\'S SAA.  THE UK AND THE NETHERLANDS 
ARE WITHHOLDING RATIFICATION UNTIL CROATIA DEMONSTRATES IN 
THE MOST CONCRETE TERMS THAT IT IS COOPERATING WITH ICTY. 
UNTIL RECENTLY, THE PRIMARY BENCHMARK HMG HAS BEEN WILLING TO 
ACCEPT IS THE APPREHENSION AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER TO ICTY 
CUSTODY OF ICTY PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA. 
 
3.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 9, A BRITISH EMBASSY OFFICER BASED IN 
ZAGREB BRIEFED US THAT THE UK WOULD NOW CONSIDER MOVING 
FORWARD WITH THE SAA IF CROATIA TOOK THE FOLLOWING STEPS: PM 
SANADER MUST MAKE AN UNEQUIVOCAL PUBLIC STATEMENT DECLARING 
HIS READINESS TO ARREST GOTOVINA AND CERTAIN SENIOR OFFICIALS 
AFFILIATED WITH CROATIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WOULD HAVE TO 
LEAVE THEIR POSTS.  THE BRITISH EMBASSY OFFICER SAID THAT 
    ZELJKO BAGIC, A SENIOR STAFFER TO PRESIDENT MESIC, WOULD HAVE 
TO GO BECAUSE HE HAS MISMANAGED CROATIA\'S INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICES AND HAS BEEN TAINTED WITH CORRUPTION.  THE OTHER 
OFFICIAL WAS DESCRIBED ONLY AS \"OFFICIALS WITH CLOSE LINKS TO 
HERVOJE PETRAC.\"  PETRAC IS NOW A WEALTHY CROATIAN 
BUSINESSMAN WITH DIVERSE INTERESTS, BUT IS WIDELY RUMORED TO 
HAVE GOTTEN HIS START IN MONEY-LAUNDERING DURING THE WAR.  HE 
HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF POLICE INVESTIGATIONS, BUT NO 
INDICTMENTS HAVE BEEN FILED.  PETRAC EMPLOYS THE DAUGHTER OF 
DAMIR LONCARIC, HEAD OF CROATIA\'S INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. 
 
4.  (C) IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR ON FEBRUARY 14, 
BRITISH AMBASSADOR NICHOLAS JARROLD CONFIRMED THAT HMG WAS 
CONSIDERING CHANGING ITS MEASURE OF HOW TO JUDGE CROATIA\'S 
COOPERATION WITH ICTY.  WHILE HE MADE NO MENTION OF THE 
\"PETRAC CONNECTION,\" HE DID CONFIRM THAT HMG WOULD SEEK 
BAGIC\'S OUSTER. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C) THE UK DECISION -- STILL UNCONFIRMED -- TO MOVE THE 
GOALPOSTS A FEW YARDS CLOSER WOULD BE A POSITIVE RESULT OF 
THE SANADER GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORT TO CONVINCE THE EU (AND US) 
THAT CROATIA IS REALLY LOOKING FOR GOTOVINA AND THAT GOTOVINA 
IS NOT IN CROATIA.  BUT THE NEW BENCHMARKS ARE STILL TOUGH 
POLITICAL HURDLES; IN AN APPEARANCE ON BBC\'S \"HARD TALK\" 
SUBSEQUENT TO HIS MEETINGS IN LONDON, FM ZUZUL REPEATEDLY 
DODGED A DIRECT QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD 
ARREST GOTOVINA. 
 
    6.  (C) WHILE THE INSISTENCE AT SACKING SENIOR INTEL 
OFFICIALS COULD SEEM ODD, IT REFLECTS UK FRUSTRATION -- WHICH 
WE SHARE -- WITH THE INTELLIGENCE ESTABLISHMENT IN ZAGREB. 
MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN BAGIC\'S AND LONCARIC\'S ALLEGED 
CONNECTIONS WITH ORGANIZED CRIME ARE THEIR LINKS TO PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE HAD CONTACT WITH GOTOVINA.  BAGIC WAS REPORTEDLY THE 
CONNECTION DURING MESIC\'S BRIEF (AND VERY INDIRECT) CONTACT 
WITH GOTOVINA IN 2003.  LONCARIC\'S CONNECTION TO PETRAC -- 
WHO IS WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE THE MONEY BEHIND THE 
SENSATIONALIST NEWSWEEKLY \"NACIONAL\" -- MAY HAVE LED TO 
GOTOVINA\'S SURFACING IN THAT PUBLICATION AROUND THE SAME 
TIME.  FINALLY, SINCE SANADER CANNOT SACK EITHER BAGIC OR 
LONCARIC WITHOUT MESIC\'S ASSENT, THIS BENCHMARK MAY BE 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE GOC TO ACHIEVE.

SUBJECT: CROATIA\'S POLITICAL OPPOSITION WOULD BLOCK TROOPS 
TO IRAQ AND ARTICLE 98 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank, reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Ambassador Frank discussed a range of issues February 
24 with former Prime Minister, SDP President and now 
opposition leader Ivica Racan, and thanked him for his 
efforts as Prime Minister to prepare Croatia for future NATO 
membership.  Racan welcomed the thanks but cautioned that his 
now-opposition SDP party would not support sending Croatian 
troops to Iraq or ratification of an Article 98 agreement in 
the current political climate.  Racan\'s opposition means that 
PM Sanader faces an almost insurmountable challenge to 
assemble the two-thirds majority vote in the Sabor among the 
other, smaller opposition parties, many of which have already 
rejected publicly any support for troops to Iraq or an 
Article 98 agreement. 
 
2. (C) Racan blamed intra-coalition conflict as the major 
cause for the defeat of his center-left coalition, noting 
that while the SDP only lost five seats, the other coalition 
partners were devastated in the polls.  However, he admitted 
some responsibility for his defeat by failing to spend more 
time building up his own party\'s organization. 
 
3. (C) On February 26, the Ambassador also met Racan\'s SDP 
colleague, former Defense Minister Zeljka Antunovic.  An 
effective reformer in office, Antunovic warned that steep 
cuts in the defense budget proposed by the ruling HDZ would 
endanger defense reforms and render it difficult for Croatia 
to fulfill its MAP obligations.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Afghanistan Yes, Iraq No 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) On February 24, Ambassador Frank met with SDP 
President and former Prime Minister Ivica Racan for the first 
time since Racan\'s party lost tQ November 23 parliamentary 
elections.  The Ambassador thanked Racan for his efforts to 
prepare Croatia to become a member of NATO, noting that the 
visit of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to Croatia on February 
8 was primarily intended to welcome Croatia\'s progress toward 
NATO and was not meant to send any signals about the change 
in government. 
 
5. (C) Racan thanked the Ambassador, noting that when in 
power, he had done everything possible to bring Croatia 
closer to NATO and the EU.  Racan agreed that U.S.-Croatia 
relations were deeper than how they were frequently depicted 
in the media which have been suggesting that close ties 
depend solely on the issues of troops to Iraq and an Article 
98 agreement.  Racan said he wants what is best for Croatia 
and would not be partisan if the ruling HDZ were able to 
build on his good work to further Croatia\'s Euro-Atlantic 
integration. 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador said he hoped that Racan could be 
equally non-partisan on the issue of sending troops to Iraq, 
which was in Croatia\'s interest and would demonstrate the 
GoC\'s willingness to share the burdens of being part of the 
global coalition against terrorism.  Racan responded that 
sending Croatian troops to Afghanistan to participate in ISAF 
had been his initiative.  He had been able to secure broad 
political support because of the clearer political context 
and general public support.  Racan said he would support an 
expansion of Croatia\'s efforts in Afghanistan, as it would 
not provoke any strong negative public reaction. 
 
7. (C) On Iraq, Racan said the situation was much more 
complex and public reaction would be much more negative.  He 
said that the SDP was in a delicate political position, and 
that any support for sending troops to Iraq would hurt the 
SDP and benefit the ruling HDZ.  Because the ruling HDZ was 
linked closely in the public mind to the U.S., the HDZ could 
plausibly cite U.S. pressure as the motivating factor for its 
support for sending troops to Iraq.  If the SDP were to 
support such a move, it would be seen as abandoning its 
principles.  Racan added that, when he was in government, he 
wanted to do much more on Iraq, but pressure from the public 
and from President Mesic forced him to retreat.  Therefore, 
any future steps in Iraq would have to be very cautious, 
initially non-military in nature, and not all at once. 
 
No Article 98 Agreement 
----------------------- 
 
8. (C) On an Article 98 agreement, Racan noted that he had 
tried to find a solution to reconcile the U.S. and Croatian 
positions.  While he supported without compromise Croatia\'s 
cooperation with the ICTY, public opinion still linked an 
Article 98 agreement with ICTY cooperation.  Racan said he 
believed that HDZ party members for the most part were in 
favor of signing an Article 98 agreement with the U.S. only 
 
because they believed it would be part of a deal that could 
get Croatia off the hook from cooperating with the ICTY.  The 
Ambassador made clear that there would be no such deal for an 
Article 98 agreement.  Racan said that while an Article 98 
agreement would be very difficult politically, he hoped that 
negotiations would continue to produce a formula to meet both 
sides\' needs. 
 
Defeat Not Racan\'s Fault 
------------------------ 
 
9. (C) In response to Ambassador Frank\'s question about how 
he would rebuild his party following the November 23 
elections, Racan said that the elections had clarified the 
political landscape in Croatia.  There was now a strong 
right-wing party in the HDZ, which he hoped would prove to be 
as moderately right-wing as PM Sanader claimed.  Racan 
credited Sanader with initiating reform of the HDZ, but said 
the work was not finished.  Racan believes that Sanader will 
be tied up with the business of governing and will not be 
able to complete reform of the HDZ he was in power. 
 
10. (C) More importantly, the elections had shattered the 
illusion that there was political space for a democratic 
center between the moderate right and the moderate left.  The 
challenge was for the SDP to become the strong moderate left 
party.  The SDP could agree on strategic issues with the HDZ 
like NATO and EU membership, but still sharply differentiate 
itself on issues of taxation, abortion, human rights, and 
social welfare. 
 
11. (C) Racan said that he would be focusing his efforts on 
rebuilding his party now that he had the time.  While in 
government, he had to focus his attention on maintaining the 
coalition and admitted that he had made a strategic error in 
neglecting party-building work while Prime Minister. 
However, Racan would not accept the notion that his party had 
lost the elections.  He noted that the SDP had only lost five 
seats, while being the only party to campaign on the basis of 
the work of the governing coalition.  The other coalition 
parties had effectively run against the coalition and been 
devastated in the polls. 
 
12. (C) Racan claimed that the election defeat was the result 
of rising public expectations that the very success of his 
government\'s policies had engendered.  He blamed 
intra-coalition squabbling for souring the public\'s appetite 
for continued coalition government and accused the media of 
being more interested in scandal-mongering than in reporting 
on the coalition\'s successes.  Racan also accused 
conservative elements of the Catholic Church, upset at the 
coalition\'s liberal social policies, of playing a worse role 
than in the previous election. 
 
Defense Reform Stalled 
---------------------- 
 
13. (C) The Ambassador followed up the Racan meeting with a 
separate meeting on February 26 with former defense minister 
(and current SDP Vice President and MP) Zeljka Antunovic to 
thank her for her work in moving the Croatian military to 
prepare for possible NATO membership.  Antunovic thanked the 
Ambassador for U.S. support for her efforts.  She said that 
now it was time for a strong public relations campaign to 
explain why it was in Croatia\'s interest to join NATO.  Such 
a campaign should also be open and direct about what were the 
obligations NATO membership would entail. 
 
14. (C) Antunovic said she was deeply concerned that the 
Defense budget proposed by the ruling HDZ would prove to be a 
costly mistake.  The cuts proposed were too deep to allow 
further work on reforming the military to meet its NATO 
obligations.  Croatia had promised NATO it would spend 2.2 
percent of GDP on the military, but the new budget was less 
than last year.  Worse, Antunovic feared that the new budget 
indicated that the HDZ leadership did not understand that 
further defense reform is not just for NATO but also in 
Croatia\'s own best defense interests. 
 
15. (C) Antunovic said she was also concerned about the new 
defense minister\'s ability to assert leadership over a balky 
bureaucracy and general staff.  She said she understood that 
leadership change always slows progress on reforms.  She 
feared that while staff work on reforms that she set in 
motion would continue, implementation could be blocked by a 
reluctant bureaucracy.  She feared that the Defense Minister 
Roncevic would not be able to reach the same modus vivendi 
she had with the defense leadership, that she would accept 
all comments and criticism but expected the military to carry 
out her decisions. 
 
16. (C) Antunovic said that President Mesic was very engaged 
on military reform issues and that she had a productive 
working relationship with him.  She said that she had agreed 
 
 
with Mesic to keep any disagreements out of the public eye 
and work together to resolve them.  Her problems had come 
more from the President\'s staff than from the President 
himself. 
 
Not Ready for Coast Guard Decision 
---------------------------------- 
 
17. (C) In response to our question, Antunovic said she had 
not made taking a decision on a Coast Guard a priority as 
Mininster.  She said the issue was in need of further 
internal discussion, as all the relevant ministries have 
different ideas on the issue.  That said, she had set in 
motion a long-term planning process at the Ministry of 
Defense, but cautioned that few people in Croatia think 
seriously about the need for inter-ministerial cooperation on 
this or any issue. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
18. (C) The hesitancy that Racan expressed to the Ambassador 
to take on public opinion or President Mesic on difficult 
issues sounded to us like deja vu all over again.  Racan\'s 
failure to assert leadership on Iraq and Article 98 was an 
important reason movement on those issues stalled under his 
tenure as prime minister.  With his SDP\'s 34 seats in the 
Sabor, Racan could have made it easier for the HDZ to gain 
the two-thirds majority of 101 (of 152) deputies needed to 
approve sending troops to Iraq or an Article 98 agreement. 
 
19. (C) It will be virtually impossible for PM Sanader to 
find the necessary votes without the SDP.  He would have to 
cobble together support from the smaller parties on the left 
and right extremes, most of which have previously come out 
against such moves.  Sanader has proved that in bringing his 
party to power he knows how to cut a political deal. 
However, we are not sanguine that even Sanader could make 
either troops to Iraq or an Article 98 agreement happen when 
a large portion of his own party base is already set against 
it.  Adding to that President Mesic\'s strong opposition to 
both initiatives, we conclude that faced with these 
considerable obstacles there is little likelihood that the 
Sanader government will be able to move forward on either 
issue in the near term.

CLASSIFIED BY: DCM PATRICK S. MOON FOR REASON 1.5 (B, D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) THE CROATIAN PRESS IS WIDELY REPORTING THAT THE 
    GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA HAS RECEIVED NEW SEALED ICTY 
INDICTMENTS FROM THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL.  THE GOVERNMENT IS 
REFUSING TO COMMENT, BUT THE PRESS CITES THAT SANADER AND 
OTHER HDZ LEADERS ARE WORKING HARD TO MANAGE POLITICAL 
FALLOUT BEFORE THE INDICTMENTS ARE MADE PUBLIC.  THE GOC 
RECOGNIZES THAT ITS COOPERATION WITH THE TRIBUNAL WILL BE 
UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S MICROSCOPE; SANADER\'S 
GOVERNMENT KNOWS THAT DECISIONS ABOUT CROATIA\'S SUITABILITY 
AS AN EU CANDIDATE WILL DEPEND ON HIS ACTIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) ON MARCH 5, ALL OF THE CROATIAN PRESS REPORTED THAT 
NEW INDICTMENTS AGAINST MLADEN MARKAC AND IVAN CERMAK HAD 
BEEN HANDED DOWN BY THE ICTY PROSECUTOR AND THAT THEY HAD 
BEEN DELIVERED UNDER SEAL TO THE GOC OFFICE FOR COOPERATION 
WITH ICTY ON FEBRUARY 26.  THE FACT OF THE INDICTMENTS HAS 
BECOME AN OPEN SECRET IN ZAGREB, BUT GOC LEADERS REFUSE TO 
COMMENT OR SPECULATE ON THE RECORD.  INDICTMENTS AGAINST 
MARKAC AND CERMAK FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES DURING AND AFTER 
\"OPERATION STORM\" IN NOVEMBER 1995 HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN 
ZAGREB SINCE JANUARY. 
 
3.  (SBU) PM SANADER REPORTEDLY BRIEFED PRESIDENT MESIC ABOUT 
THE INDICTMENTS ON MARCH 1.  MESIC IN TURN BRIEFED FORMER PM 
RACAN (NOW LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION) ON MARCH 2.  ACCORDING 
TO PRESS REPORTS, SANADER HAS ALSO DISCUSSED THE INDICTMENTS 
WITH ANTO DJAPIC, LEADER OF THE EXTREME NATIONALIST CROATIAN 
PARTY OF RIGHT (HSP) IN ORDER TO TEMPER THE HSP REACTION AND 
THEREBY COVER THE GOVERNMENT\'S NATIONALIST POLITICAL FLANK. 
THE PRESS REPORTS THAT SANADER WANTS THE TWO INDICTEES TO 
ANNOUNCE THE INDICTMENTS THEMSELVES, AT THE SAME TIME AS THEY 
PUBLICLY AGREE TO TRAVEL TO THE HAGUE TO ANSWER THE CHARGES. 
    THE GOVERNMENT WILL REPORTEDLY OFFER THE COURT THE SAME 
\"GUARANTEES\" FOR MARKAC AND CERMAK WHICH IT GAVE ON BEHALF OF 
ICTY INDICTEE RAHIM ADEMI, WHO WAS RELEASED BY ICTY TO AWAIT 
TRIAL AT HOME IN CROATIA. 
 
4.  (SBU) CERMAK IS ALREADY ON THE PUBLIC RECORD AS DECLARING 
HIS READINESS TO GO THE HAGUE IF INDICTED.  IN A RECENT PRESS 
INTERVIEW CERMAK NOTED THAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN \"INTERVIEWED\" 
BY ICTY INVESTIGATORS.  HE TOLD THE PRESS THAT HE \"WOULD 
CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE HAGUE\" SO AS \"NOT TO CAUSE 
PROBLEMS FOR HIS HOMELAND,\" A CLEAR REFERENCE TO THE DAMAGE 
TO CROATIA\'S EU BID CAUSED BY ICTY PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA\'S 
FUGITIVE STATUS. 
 
INDICTMENTS AGAINST BOSNIAN CROATS 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) CROATIA\'S PRESS REPORTS THAT ICTY INDICTMENTS HAVE 
BEEN HANDED DOWN ON THREE BOSNIAN CROATS, MILIVOJ PETKOVIC, 
JADRANKO PRLIC AND SLOBODAN PRALJAK, ALL FOR ACTIVITIES 
DURING THE WAR IN BIH.  PETKOVIC AND PRALJAK WERE HVO 
COMMANDERS AND PRLIC WAS PRESIDENT OF THE SHORT-LIVED 
PSEUDO-STATE OF HERCEG-BOSNA.  PRALJAK AND PETKOVIC BOTH 
RESIDE IN ZAGREB.  PETKOVIC IS CURRENTLY THE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL OF THE CROATIAN ARMY AND PRALJAK (WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ANCIENT MOSTAR BRIDGE) IS A 
BUSINESSMAN PROMINENT IN ZAGREB HIGH SOCIETY.  WHILE THESE 
THREE INDICTMENTS WILL LIKELY BE LESS POLITICALLY SENSITIVE 
-- THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAR IN BOSNIA AND NOT WITH 
THE RECAPTURE OF CROATIAN TERRITORY IN \"OPERATION STORM\" -- 
THEY WILL ALSO PRESENT POLITICAL CHALLENGES TO THE SANADER 
    GOVERNMENT. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C) WHILE THESE INDICTMENTS PRESENT A POLITICAL CHALLENGE 
TO THE SANADER GOVERNMENT, THEY ALSO PRESENT AN IMPORTANT 
OPPORTUNITY.  SANADER HAS BEEN SEEKING TO CONVINCE THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- AND PARTICULARLY EU DECISIONMAKERS 
-- THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS DOING ALL IT CAN TO COOPERATE FULLY 
WITH THE ICTY, DESPITE CROATIA\'S FAILURE TO APPREHEND AND 
TRANSFER GOTOVINA.  IF SANADER CAN \"DELIVER\" ON THE NEW SET 
OF INDICTMENTS, HIS ARGUMENT ON GOTOVINA WILL BE 
STRENGTHENED.  QUICK AND DECISIVE ACTION COULD ALSO OVERCOME 
SPECIFIC BRITISH AND DUTCH RESERVATIONS THAT ARE BLOCKING 
CROATIA\'S EU CANDIDACY.

SUBJECT: AGREEMENT ON SUCCESSION ISSUES RATIFIED 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PLS PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY:  LATE ON MARCH 3, THE CROATIAN 
PARLIAMENT RATIFIED THE AGREEMENT ON SUCCESSION ISSUES 
AND ADOPTED A CONCLUSION COMMITTING THE GOVERNMENT TO 
CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION INTO $589 MILLION WHICH ARE 
\"MISSING\" FROM JOINT VENTURE BANK ACCOUNTS.  CROATIA IS 
    THE LAST COUNTRY OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA SUCCESSOR 
STATES TO RATIFY THE AGREEMENT FIRST REACHED IN VIENNA 
IN 2001.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) LAST MONTH THE NEW HDZ-LED CROATIAN GOVERNMENT 
PROPOSED TO PARLIAMENT THAT RATIFICATION MOVE FORWARD ON 
THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, WHICH 
ONLY CROATIA HAD NOT RATIFIED.  PRIME MINISTER IVO 
SANADER POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS THE COUNTRY\'S OBLIGATION 
TO RATIFY THIS AGREEMENT.  FOREIGN MINISTER MIOMIR ZUZUL 
SAID THAT PROLONGING THE RATIFICATION OF THE AGREEMENT 
WAS DAMAGING FOR POLITICAL REASONS AND ALSO BECAUSE 
PROPERTY VALUES SUBJECT TO THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT WERE 
DETERIORATING.  THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, NERVOUS ABOUT 
WHAT SORT OF CRITICISM THE DEAL WOULD FACE, HAD REFUSED 
TO SEND IT TO PARLIAMENT FOR A VOTE. 
 
3.  (SBU) AT THE EXPERT LEVEL, ZDRAVKO ROGIC, A TOP 
ADVISOR ON SUCCESSION ISSUES, WHO UNDER THE PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT HAD VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED THE DEAL WITHOUT A 
FULL ACCOUNTING OF THE MISSING MONEY, TOLD US LAST MONTH 
THAT IT WAS TIME TO MOVE AHEAD.  HE INDICATED THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD STILL WORK WITHIN THE FINANCIAL 
COMMITTEE OF THE SFRY STATES TO GET AN ACCOUNTING OF THE 
MISSING MONEY.  HE PRAISED THE NEW LEADERSHIP AT THE 
SERBIAN CENTRAL BANK AS BEING WILLING TO COOPERATE, BUT 
NOTED THAT POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES IN BELGRADE RENDERED 
PROGRESS SLOW. 
 
4.  (SBU) RECENT PRESS REPORTS CLAIMED THE EU AND U.S. 
WERE PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO RATIFY 
    THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT EVEN THOUGH CROATIA STILL 
CLAIMED $589 MILLION HAD GONE MISSING FROM JOINT VENTURE 
BANKS (SOME 90 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT \"VALUED ON 21 MARCH 
2001\" IN THE AGREEMENT).  WHILE WE HAD NOT MADE THIS A 
TOP PRIORITY IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOC, WE HAVE 
CONSISTENTLY MADE CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDED TO 
MOVE AHEAD ON THIS ISSUE.  IN REGARD TO THE MISSING 
MONEY, WE HAVE URGED ROGIC TO FIND A WAY TO RESOLVE 
DIFFERENCES WITH BELGRADE.  THE U.S. DE-BLOCKED USD 225 
MILLION IN U.S. BANKS A YEAR AGO USING THE VIENNA 
AGREEMENT ON DIVISION OF ASSETS OF THE FORMER SFRY. 
CROATIA BECAME ENTITLED TO USD 56 MILLION AS OF MAY 
2003. 
 
5.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO ZAGREB\'S EC MISSION, THE 
EUROPEANS HAVE TAKEN A SIMILAR TACK.  THEY HAVE WANTED 
TO SEE THE AGREEMENT RATIFIED, BUT HAD NOT BEEN APPLYING 
PARTICULAR PRESSURE ON CROATIAN AUTHORITIES IN RECENT 
MONTHS. 
 
6.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO A PRESS COMMENTARY ON MARCH 3 IN 
ZAGREB DAILY DNEVNIK, RATIFICATION OF THE SUCCESSION 
AGREEMENT COULD TRIGGER RESISTANCE TO THE RETURN OF 
PROPERTY AND TENANCY RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY THE AGREEMENT. 
ASKED IF TENANCY RIGHTS WERE COVERED IN THE AGREEMENT, 
BOZO MARANDIC, THE GOVERNMENT\'S POINT PERSON ON THE 
SUCCESSION TALKS, SAID ONLY, \"YES AND NO.\"  IN FACT, 
PRIVATE PROPERTY AND \"ACQUIRED\" RIGHTS ARE COVERED IN 
ANNEX G OF THE VIENNA AGREEMENT.  ACCORDING TO 
BELGRADE\'S AMBASSADOR IN ZAGREB, ANNEX G, NOT MISSING 
MONEY FROM THE JOINT VENTURE BANKS, WAS THE REAL SOURCE 
    OF CONSTERNATION PREVENTING THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT FROM 
TAKING THE SUCCESSION AGREEMENT TO THE PARLIAMENT FOR 
RATIFICATION.

MOU RATIFIED AFTER ALMOST SIX YEARS 
 
 Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Late on March 3, the Croatian parliament 
approved the Memorandum of Understanding on 
Intellectual Property Rights, which the GOC had 
signed in May 1998 but had never ratified.  While the 
MOU does not go into effect until implementing 
regulations and laws are in force and diplomatic 
notes are exchanged, the ratification is a major 
achievement that must be credited to the Sanader 
government.  As always, the battle now moves to the 
arena of implementation and enforcement.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) On March 3, the 1998 Memorandum of 
Understanding on Intellectual was ratified, with 77 
votes in favor, 23 votes against and one abstention. 
When the former HDZ government signed the MOU in May 
1998, it promised to have the MOU in force by June 
1999.  Over the years since then, the GOC has offered 
various reasons for delay, but eventually 
acknowledged that the unwillingness of Croatian 
pharmaceutical producers to give up the ability to 
use clinical data created by others (including U.S. 
drug companies) was the real problem. 
 
3.  (SBU) Even before the November 2003elections, top 
members of the current HDZ-led government promised to 
make good on Croatia\'s outstanding commitment and to 
ratify the agreement.  While seemingly easier to make 
good on than other U.S. requests (i.e., Article 98 
agreement, assistance for the Coalition in Iraq), 
ratification was far from certain.  The local 
pharmaceutical companies did not want to come out 
publicly against the agreement, so chose to try to 
undermine it behind the scenes. 
 
4.  (SBU) When the MOU was initially put on the 
parliamentary agenda mid-February, immediately after 
after it on the agenda were amendments to the Drug 
Law, which purported to bring domestic legislation 
into line with the MOU.  These amendments had been 
prepared by the Ministry of Health and approved by 
the Cabinet with little debate.  However, the effect 
of the amendments would have been to gut the MOU. 
Luckily, after protest from the U.S. innovative drug 
industry, the amendments were withdrawn. 
 
5.  (SBU) Interestingly, amendments to the Patent 
Law, necessary to implement the \"pipeline protection\" 
aspects of the MOU, were prepared by the Ministry of 
Science and Education and are adequate, according to 
U.S. industry experts. 
 
6.  (SBU) There were several attempts to open the MOU 
up for amendment (the Sanader government had 
submitted the bill for a streamlined, up-or-down 
vote).  Sources close to the committee debate said 
the deputies were told that Croatia was the only 
country to saddle itself with such an agreement, that 
other countries had given themselves until EU 
accession to implement similar provisions, etc.  The 
day before the final vote, the newspapers were full 
of stories decrying the possible effect of the 
agreement on the Croatian pharmaceutical industry. 
Damage figures -- which the industry and government 
had been unable to produce for years -- were quoted 
at $200 million -- a figure our industry describes as 
ludicrous. 
 
7.  (SBU) As ratification became inevitable, local 
drug companies\' strategy turned to plotting to 
neutralize \"negative effects\" of the MOU.  A Belupo 
spokesperson told the press, \"Belupo believes in the 
Government\'s readiness to consult the experts of the 
Croatian pharmaceutical companies in drafting the 
implementing legislation in order to make MOU\'s 
consequences as acceptable as possible.\"  Her 
counterpart at Pliva said \"they (Pliva) expect that 
the implementing legislation will eliminate any 
dilemmas in the agreement\'s implementation.\" 
 
Comment 
 
 
------- 
 
8.  (SBU) The current government deserves credit for 
making ratification of the MOU a priority and for 
pushing it through.  There are some individuals -- 
mainly in the Ministry of Health -- who will 
try to undermine the MOU in the process of drafting 
implementing legislation and regulations.  We will 
continue to monitor and engage the government 
to prevent dilution of the agreement\'s hard-won benefits.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On March 2 Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs 
Paula Dobriansky visited Croatia and met with President 
Stjepan Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, and Foreign 
Minister Miomir Zuzul.  The Under Secretary discussed 
Croatia\'s participation in the Community of Democracies, the 
UN Commission on Human Rights, and how Croatia might become 
more engaged in Afghanistan, as well as refugee return and 
reintegration, progress on combating trafficking in persons, 
and cooperation with the ICTY in a full day of meetings in 
Zagreb.  Sanader and Zuzul pressed at every opportunity for 
U.S. support for Croatia\'s entry into NATO and the EU.  End 
Summary. 
 
Interlocutors 
------------- 
 
2. (U) On March 2, Under Secretary of State for Global 
Affairs Paula Dobriansky visited Croatia for one day of 
meetings with senior government officials.  She began the day 
with a working lunch at the Office of the Prime Minister; 
participants included Ambassador Ralph Frank, Prime Minister 
Ivo Sanader, Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul, and other high 
level state officials.  U/S Dobriansky next visited the 
Foreign Ministry, where she again met with Foreign Minister 
Zuzul and his staff.  Zuzul introduced the new government\'s 
line up of MFA officials working on bilateral and 
multilateral issues of concern to the U.S.  Late in the day 
President Sthjepan Mesic hosted U/S Dobriansky for a meeting 
at his Office; Foreign Minister Zuzul and the president\'s 
senior foreign policy advisors joined in the meeting. 
 
Croatia\'s EU and Nato Aspirations 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Sanader and Zuzul returned at every available 
opportunity to their priority theme -- Croatia seeks visible 
support from Washington for entry into the EU and NATO at the 
earliest opportunity.  The recent visit to Croatia by SecDef 
Rumsfeld was cast as a major step forward in bilateral 
relations. 
 
4. (C) Sanader and Zuzul both stressed that they are pursuing 
return and reintegration and cooperation with ICTY not only 
because Croatia is obligated to do so, but because they are 
the right things to do.  They also acknowledged that such a 
path is necessary for entry into the EU and NATO.  They 
claimed that Croatia is the most advanced country in the 
region, and that it could be the success story, the example 
for others to follow. 
 
5. (C) However, in order for the GOC to do the right things 
on issues of concern to the international community -- issues 
on which the public holds \"mixed feelings\" or significantly 
opposes -- the GOC needs to receive clear signals of support 
or acceptance by the United States and the international 
community. 
 
6. (C) Specifically, what they would like out of the next 
NATO summit is communique language in which each aspirant 
country is mentioned by name, its successes are recognized, 
and its future path of entry is defined.  U/S Dobriansky 
noted their arguments and said she would convey the 
Government\'s message to Washington. 
 
Refugee Return and Reintegration 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) PM Ivo Sanader opened his meeting with U/S Dobriansky 
by stressing actions he has taken to encourage ethnic Serb 
refugees to return to Croatia.  He noted that five days prior 
to the November elections he had called publicly for the 
return of refugees, signaling to supporters of his 
center-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party the 
direction he intended to lead the country should the HDZ come 
to power. 
 
8. (C) Following the elections, in his quest to form a 
government, Sanader gained the support of all eight MPs 
representing minorities in parliament.  In a further 
unprecedented move for a Prime Minister of Croatia, Sanader 
celebrated Christmas with the Serbian Orthodox community -- 
an action he described as a big shock for Croatian society. 
He frankly acknowledged the \"old\" HDZ\'s poor record on 
 
minority issues and said there is no alternative now to 
\"normal relations.\"  The new government is only 70 days old, 
but Sanader was pleased to report on his efforts to promote 
return and reintegration. 
 
9. (C) President Mesic, who offered no timetable except to 
say that the process had begun, affirmed that the government 
would reconstruct all homes destroyed during the war.  He 
said it was in Croatia\'s interest for all citizens to return 
if democracy were to take root and thrive.  He was positive 
about the general human rights situation in Croatia, minority 
protections, and the strides Croatia has made with regard to 
development of a free press.  On the other hand, he affirmed 
that judicial reform had yet to begin and was sorely needed 
for Croatia to consolidate its democratic transition. 
 
10. (C) U/S Dobriansky stressed in her meetings the 
importance of working specifically on the process of 
reintegration.  She said that other countries have 
experiences with reintegration that can be drawn on, and that 
the U.S. will work with the GOC and perhaps make available 
outside expertise on reintegration.  The offer was made of a 
potential joint visit to Croatia of PRM A/S Dewey and UNHCR 
Head Rudd Lubbers to meet with their Croatian counterparts on 
reintegration to discuss best practices and how the 
government might improve its chances for success in this 
crucial area. 
 
Community of Democracies 
------------------------ 
 
11. (C) The Under Secretary highlighted the good work being 
done within the framework of the Community of Democracies 
(CD).  She said the CD is an important affiliation and 
encouraged Croatia to play a greater leadership role in 
sharing its experiences along the path of transition to 
democracy. 
 
12. (C) The GOC was receptive to greater involvement with the 
CD.  PM Sanader remarked \"I fully agree with this.\"  FM Zuzul 
asked for elaboration on specific ways in which the GOC can 
help.  U/S Dobriansky expressed her desire to continue 
discussions on the issue, and offered to provide more 
specific suggestions on how Croatia might play a larger role 
within the CD. 
 
UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR) 
----------------------------------- 
 
13. (C) U/S Dobriansky told PM Sanader the U.S. wants to work 
with the GOC at the CHR to partner on issues of mutual 
concern.  She informed FM Zuzul that the U.S. delegation will 
hold a breakfast meeting on March 17 for all democracies in 
the CHR.  She invited Croatia to attend.  This meeting would 
be an opportunity for democracies to discuss their priorities 
for CHR and coordinate as appropriate.  She announced that we 
are working with several Latin American nations to co-sponsor 
this year\'s resolution on Cuba, and she requested that 
Croatia consider co-sponsoring the resolution. 
 
14. (C) Zuzul commented that the Czech Republic had 
approached Croatia on this year\'s Cuba resolution.  He 
promised the GOC would seriously consider the request. 
However, he cautioned that co-sponsoring would be difficult 
if there is no other European co-sponsor.  He noted that by 
co-sponsoring the Cuba resolution, Croatian companies doing 
business in Cuba would likely suffer. 
 
15. (C) The Under Secretary also asked Croatia to support the 
U.S. position in the CHR on China.  She said the U.S. was not 
seeking co-sponsorship, but merely support.  Zuzul offered no 
reaction on China.  Comment: Croatia is opposed to country 
specific resolutions in principle; moving the GOC away from 
this position could prove challenging.  End Comment. 
 
Participation in Afghanistan 
---------------------------- 
 
16. (C) In addition to playing a larger role within the CD, 
U/S Dobriansky stressed that greater participation in 
Afghanistan offers Croatia a larger stage for sharing its 
democratic development experiences.  She was just in 
Afghanistan, and she spoke not just of the needs of Afghans, 
but of the tremendous work being done by the international 
forces now in the country as Afghanistan strives to recover 
from decades of war. 
 
17. (C) Zuzul offered to explore areas in which Croatia might 
be able to provide additional assistance.  The Croatian 
experience, in war and in the post-conflict period, means 
 
that many people have skills that could be used in 
Afghanistan.  Examples would be in medical teams, counselors 
for victims of post-traumatic stress syndrome, and demining. 
 
Cooperation with the Hague Tribunal 
----------------------------------- 
 
18. (C) Sanader mentioned Croatia\'s relationship with the 
Hague Tribunal.  He said his government is committed to 
nothing less than full and unconditional cooperation with the 
ICTY in all cases, including that of indictee Ante Gotovina. 
He added that Andre Hebrang, Minister of Health, and Branimir 
Glavas, the HDZ party head and county prefect in Eastern 
Slavonia, members of the party\'s so-called hardline faction, 
have both supported HDZ\'s policy of cooperation with the 
ICTY; they have both called publicly for Gotovina to turn 
himself in to The Hague. 
 
19. (C) In his meeting, Sanader also told the Under Secretary 
that cooperation with The Hague is a far more difficult issue 
for the government than, for example, refugee return.  The 
average Croatian finds it extremely hard to accept that the 
people who recovered Croatian territory and brought the 
country to independence are war criminals.  U/S Dobriansky 
commented that cooperation with the ICTY is important for 
fulfilling Croatia\'s Euro-Atlantic aspirations, and that the 
international community will be looking not so much at what 
Croatia says but at what it actually does. 
 
Trafficking in Persons 
---------------------- 
 
20. (C) Dobriansky raised trafficking in persons as an issue 
in her meetings.  Sanader demonstrated an awareness of U.S. 
concerns and said he wanted to work with the U.S. so that 
Croatia can move from Tier 2 to Tier 1 on the Annual Report 
to Congress on Trafficking in Persons.  In her meetings with 
Sanader and Zuzul, the Under Secretary suggested that the GOC 
designate an effective point of contact on the issue of 
trafficking, someone who could 
ensure compliance within the government as well as work 
closely with the international community. 
 
21. (C) Zuzul told the Under Secretary that responsibility 
for the issue of trafficking was now with the foreign 
ministry, and that Tomislav Vidosevic, the newly appointed 
Assistant Minister for Multilateral Affairs, would be our 
point of contact.  (Vidosevic manages the MFA\'s Department 
for Human Rights.)  Andrea Bekic, acting head of the MFA\'s 
Americas Department, cited the November 2003 
UNICEF/UNHCHR/OSCE ODIHR report as evidence that Croatia is 
doing well in the fight against trafficking.  She provided us 
with a copy of the December 2003 Non-Paper on Trafficking in 
Croatia presented by Croatia\'s Embassy in Washington to the 
Department. 
 
22. (C) The Under Secretary noted that some countries, and 
the EU, have identified the institution of the Ombudsman as 
an independent, yet government sanctioned point of contact 
for trafficking issues.  An ombudsman, for example, could 
issue an independent report on governmental actions to combat 
trafficking in persons.  U/S Dobriansky stressed that it is 
also important for the Embassy of Croatia in Washington to 
engage actively with the Department on the issue of 
trafficking in persons.  Zuzul said he would instruct 
Croatia\'s DCM in Washington to contact G/TIP and engage with 
the Department as a point of contact on the problem.

SUBJECT: SURVEY ON REFUGEE RETURN TO CROATIA 
 
Classified By: PolOff Mitch Benedict for reason 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Results of an extensive survey, financed jointly by 
USAID and the OSCE, show that only five percent of ethnic 
Serb refugees -- approximately 10,500 out of the estimated 
210,000 ethnic Serbs from Croatia who are now in Serbia or 
Bosnia -- plan to return to Croatia in the next five years, 
and that receiving communities remain strongly opposed to 
return.  The survey indicates that there are still strong 
currents of antipathy in Croatia to Serb refugee returns and 
that additional substantial returns of refugees are unlikely. 
 The survey has not yet been released publicly; however, the 
OSCE has discussed the results with the Government and 
briefed UNHCR. 
 
2. (C) The reported five percent who plan to return compares 
with 25-30 percent of Croatia Serbs in Serbia who two years 
ago told UNHCR representatives they would return to Croatia 
under \"certain conditions.\"  The Croatia OSCE Mission says 
the survey simply confirms what they already know, mainly 
that refugee populations lack sufficient information in order 
to make an informed decision on return.  We believe that 
information provided through an organized campaign, as 
proposed by the OSCE Mission, is by itself unlikely to boost 
returns substantially, and that in the end additional returns 
of ethnic Serb refugees to Croatia will number somewhere 
between the optimistic OSCE projection of 40,000 and the 
survey\'s 10,500.  End Summary. 
 
Background and Methodology of Survey 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) USAID, in support of the OSCE\'s return and 
reintegration program, financed a survey to determine the 
emotional and motivational factors that affect the return of 
refugees (primarily Croatian Serbs) and the level of 
acceptance of their return by the local population.  The 
survey, conducted by the Zagreb-based PULS Agency, looked at 
four different populations: (1) the domiciled population, 
mixed but largely ethnic Croat, living in areas of return for 
ethnic Serb refugees (the so-called \"war-affected areas\"); 
(2) ethnic Serb refugees originally from Croatia who are 
living in Serbia Montenegro and Bosnia Herzegovina; (3) 
ethnic Croat refugees from Bosnia Herzegovina who are living 
in Croatia; and, (4) a reference group of all Croatian 
citizens. (Comment: the 2001 census reported that 89.6 
percent of the population of Croatia is ethnic Croat; ethnic 
Serbs make up 4.5 percent, and no other ethnic group makes up 
more than 0.5 percent of the population.  The 1991 census 
found that 12.6 percent of the population was ethnic Serbs. 
End Comment.) 
 
4. (SBU) The PULS survey was based on a questionnaire that 
was completed through a personal interview conducted in the 
respondent\'s place of residence.  Interviews lasted 30-40 
minutes, and were conducted in the December 2003 to January 
2004 timeframe.  The sample size for each of the four groups 
varied, but was between 600-1000 for each of the four groups. 
 The research represented the largest survey done on public 
attitudes regarding the issue of refugee return and 
reintegration to date. 
 
Substantial Additional Returns Unlikely 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Only five percent of both refugee populations -- 
ethnic Croat refugees from Bosnia Herzegovina and ethnic Serb 
refugees from Croatia -- say they plan on returning to their 
former country of domicile in the next five years.  Given 
that there are approximately 210,000 ethnic Serb refugees 
(190,000 in Serbia Montenegro and 20,000 in Bosnia 
Herzegovina), a return rate of five percent would mean that 
only 10,500 ethnic Serb refugees plan to return.  Only 15 
percent of ethnic Serb refugees described Croatia as a place 
they would want to live and 60 percent say they will never 
return to their former homes. 
 
6. (SBU) Information provided by former acquaintances, 
friends, and family forms the basis of what refugees know 
about former communities and homes.  Most survey respondents 
know someone who returned, and such private sources of 
information are the most trusted.  Less than 15 percent of 
ethnic Serbs living in Serbia Montenegro report having heard 
positive impressions about conditions in their former homes, 
 
while over 30 percent report having heard negative 
impressions.  More than half of all ethnic Serbs responded 
that living among people of their own nationality is 
important or very important, which also supports a survey 
finding that both ethnic Croats and ethnic Serbs would be 
more willing to return if there is a return en masse. 
 
7. (SBU) Younger and more educated survey respondents are the 
least likely to want to return -- a finding which is 
reflected by the actual returnee population.  Most returnees 
are elderly; young people and families are unlikely to return 
to where there are no jobs, and the prospects for employment 
are slim.  A large majority of respondents -- 68 percent of 
ethnic Serb refugees and 78 percent of ethnic Croat refugees 
-- say their primary focus over the next five years is to 
improve their living conditions where they now live. 
 
Return of Refugees Still Strongly Opposed 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Among the domiciled population in war-affected areas 
of Croatia -- the mixed but largely ethnic Croat population 
that never left Croatia -- there is still strong opposition 
to the return of ethnic Serb refugees.   Fully 30 percent of 
the population currently residing in war-affected areas 
responded that cohabitation between ethnic Serbs and Croats 
is completely or mostly impossible; half the respondents said 
they felt ethnic Serbs want to return to Croatia because they 
want to start the war again. 
 
9. (SBU) By a margin of over 2:1 those who live in 
war-affected areas, and ethnic Croat refugees from Bosnia, 
think the return of Serbian refugees is not a good thing for 
Croatia.  In addition, nearly 50 percent of the general 
population of Croatia thinks that the return of Serbian 
refugees is not a good thing for Croatia.  Of the population 
living in war-affected areas, nearly 80 percent have had 
Serbian refugees return to their town or village, and more 
than half the respondents report they are not happy about it. 
 
10. (SBU) There is also strong opposition to government 
assistance to ethnic Serb returnees, including reconstruction 
of homes and provision of alternative accommodation.  Only 
three percent of all non-Serb respondents said the Government 
should encourage ethnic Serbs to return and give them all 
possible assistance to do so.  In contrast, 30-40 percent of 
all non-Serb respondents said the government should not help 
Serbian refugees at all.  A majority of respondents of the 
domiciled population in war-affected areas that never left, 
and the general population, think that ethnic Serbs should 
not get back their occupancy/tenancy rights.  In general, 
27-35 percent of all non-Serb respondents believe that ethnic 
Serbs left Croatia voluntarily and should not be allowed 
back. 
 
 
OSCE Remains Guardedly Optimistic 
--------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) The OSCE Mission to Croatia told us that the survey 
confirms what the Mission already knows: there are strong 
reservations on the part of receiving communities toward the 
return of ethnic Serb refugees.  However, OSCE Mission 
staffers have told us that the survey offers wide latitude 
for interpretation -- and that a total return of only 10,500 
refugees (para 7) is well below their expectations.  The 
OSCE\'s Return and Reintegration Unit will argue that they 
still expect approximately 14,000 total households -- at 
least 40,000 people -- to return by the end of 2006.  Higher 
returns are still possible, according to the OSCE, if full 
and complete information is made available to potential 
returnees. 
 
12. (U) The OSCE\'s optimistic figures are also based in part 
on an informal survey conducted in 2001 by UNHCR in Serbia 
during a re-registration exercise of all 230,000 refugees 
from Croatia in Serbia at the time.  The data showed that 
approximately 25-30 percent of refugees -- 70,000 people -- 
said that they would return to Croatia under certain 
conditions, the primary one being return of housing or 
provision of alternative accommodation. 
 
13. (U) A projected return of 14,000 households is based on 
the following.  There are 12,000 pending applications for 
reconstruction assistance, and of those approximately half 
are likely to receive positive decisions for reconstruction 
assistance.  In addition, the OSCE calculates that 
 
approximately 23,000 households outside war-affected areas, 
and perhaps and additional 10,000 households within 
war-affected areas, lost their occupancy/tenancy right (OTR) 
to live in socially owned apartments.  According to the 
Government\'s estimate -- which the OSCE assumes to be low -- 
only 5,000 OTR holders will avail themselves of alternative 
accommodation and return to Croatia.  Therefore, a total 
figure of 14,000 households still to return is based on 6,000 
apartment dwelling families who receive compensation for lost 
OTR; 6,000 families who receive reconstruction assistance; 
and, 2,000 families who return to claimed properties that are 
now still occupied. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
14. (C) The total number of additional returns through the 
end of 2006 is likely to fall somewhere between the survey\'s 
low estimate of 10,500 total individuals and the OSCE\'s 
optimistic estimate of 40,000.  Unmarried youth and young 
families are the least likely to return because employment 
opportunities in the war-affected areas are relatively bleak 
and will remain so for the foreseeable future. 
 
15. (C) The disincentives for the working age population to 
return are strong.  There are few economic incentives for 
businesses to locate in these areas, and the huge socialist 
behemoths that once employed the masses by the thousands are 
either dead or dying for lack of investment and markets. 
Consequently, potential returnees are going to remain the 
elderly and those willing to engage in small-scale 
agricultural pursuits -- a limited population that is only 
getting smaller. 
 
16. (C) We believe that OSCE and/or GOC information campaigns 
designed to encourage return are likely to be only marginally 
effective at best.  Refugees are most likely to continue to 
make decisions on their future based on what they hear from 
former neighbors, friends, and family members who have 
returned.  The attitudes of receiving communities, and how 
those attitudes play out in terms of safety and security, 
will remain paramount.  A half million dollar ad campaign, 
for example, is likely to fall on deaf ears if ethnic Serb 
males can be arbitrarily arrested and detained on war crimes 
accusations (the perception in Eastern Slavonia), or that, 
once reconstructed, one\'s house may be attacked and burned -- 
as happened recently in the Zadar hinterlands. 
 
17. (C) One could interpret the survey to mean that the 
primary factors determining return are societal attitudes and 
jobs, variables over which the GOC has only marginal control 
in the short to mid-term.  That, combined with the estimate 
that the total number of future returnees is going to be 
relatively small, should give the GOC confidence to do all it 
can on the variables over which it does have control -- 
namely processing applications for reconstruction assistance, 
facilitating repossession, and providing alternative 
accommodation for former holders of OTR.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) ON MARCH 11, AS EXPECTED, RETIRED CROATIAN GENERALS 
MLADEN MARKAC AND IVAN CERMAK DEPARTED VOLUNTARILY FOR THE 
HAGUE TO FACE WAR CRIMES INDICTMENTS.  PRESS REPORTS INDICATE 
THAT MARKAC AND CERMAK WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY UPON ARRIVAL 
IN AMSTERDAM.  ICTY ISSUED A STATEMENT WELCOMING CROATIA\'S 
COOPERATION ON THIS CASE.  POLITICAL REACTION IN ZAGREB HAS 
BEEN PREDICTABLE AND RELATIVELY MINIMAL.  PM SANADER AND 
OTHER GOC OFFICIALS OBJECT TO THE INDICTMENT\'S 
CHARACTERIZATION OF CROATIA\'S WAR OF INDEPENDENCE AS A 
\"CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE\" BUT NOTE THAT THE PLACE TO VOICE THESE 
OBJECTIONS IS BEFORE THE COURT.  MOST POLITICAL FIGURES 
SUPPORTED THE TRANSFER OF THE TWO INDICTEES.  EXTREME 
RIGHT-WING POLITICIANS, HOWEVER, CALLED THE HDZ GOVERNMENT\'S 
ACQUIESCENCE \"HIGH TREASON.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO THE PRESS, THE CROWD THAT GATHERED AT 
ZAGREB\'S AIRPORT ON THE MORNING OF MARCH 11 TO BID FAREWELL 
TO CROATIA\'S LATEST ICTY INDICTEES WAS SMALL, WELL-BEHAVED 
AND MELANCHOLY, RATHER THAN ANGRY.  RETIRED CROATIAN GENERALS 
MLADEN MARKAC AND IVAN CERMAK DEPARTED VOLUNTARILY FOR 
AMSTERDAM ON A REGULARLY-SCHEDULED FLIGHT.  THE PRESS REPORTS 
THAT THEY WERE TAKEN INTO ICTY CUSTODY SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVAL. 
 
3.  (SBU) THERE WAS NEVER ANY REAL DOUBT AS TO WHETHER THE 
TWO WOULD SURRENDER (REF).  THE FACT THAT THEY WERE THE NEXT 
LIKELY INDICTEES HAS BEEN AN OPEN SECRET IN THE CROATIAN 
PRESS FOR MONTHS.  IN ALL OF HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS, PM 
    SANADER HAS CONSISTENTLY INSISTED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD 
COOPERATE FULLY WITH ICTY.  SOME OPPOSITION LEADERS CALLED 
FOR A DEBATE ABOUT THE INDICTMENT IN THE PARLIAMENT, BUT THIS 
CALL WAS REJECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  FORMER PM RACAN TOOK A 
CHEAP POLITICAL SHOT AT SANADER BY CALLING FOR \"ALL HDZ 
MEMBERS TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION.\"  SANADER SHOT 
BACK BY CALLING ON ALL MEMBERS OF CROATIA\'S SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY TO RE-ELECT RACAN AS PARTY PRESIDENT AND THEREBY ASSURE 
THE HDZ OF ANOTHER TERM IN OFFICE. 
 
4.  (SBU) SANADER OBJECTED TO LANGUAGE IN THE INDICTMENT 
WHICH BROADLY DESCRIBES THE ACTIONS BY CROATIAN FORCES IN 
\"OPERATION STORM\" AS A \"JOINT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE\" AND NAMES 
FORMER PRESIDENT FRANJO TUDJMAN AS AN ACCOMPLICE.  AMONG 
OTHER OBJECTIONS, SANADER BRISTLED AT LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT THE 
INDICTMENT WHICH STATES THAT THE GOAL OF CROATIAN FORCES\' 
ACTION WAS THE DEPORTATION AND FORCED DISPLACEMENT OF ETHNIC 
SERBS FROM THE KRAJINA REGION.  BUT TO HIS CREDIT, SANADER 
INSISTED THAT THE ONLY APPROPRIATE PLACE TO VOICE THESE 
OBJECTIONS IS BEFORE THE COURT.  FEW CROATIAN POLITICIANS ARE 
DISCUSSING THE INDICTMENT\'S DAMNING DESCRIPTIONS OF MURDERS, 
PLUNDER AND WANTON DESTRUCTION IN THE KRAJINA REGION 
FOLLOWING \"OPERATION STORM.\" 
 
5.  (SBU) THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS OBJECTIONS TO THE GOC DECISION 
TO TRANSFER MARKAC AND CERMAK CAME FROM IVIC PASALIC AND 
MIRKO CONDIC.  (NOTE: IVIC PASALIC CHALLENGED SANADER FOR THE 
PRESIDENCY OF THE HDZ PARTY IN 2002 AND NARROWLY LOST; HE 
THEN FORMED THE \"CROATIAN BLOC\" PARTY, WHICH WON NOT A SINGLE 
SEAT IN RECENT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  CONDIC HEADS A 
HIGHLY POLITICIZED CROATIAN VETERANS ORGANIZATION.)  PASALIC 
    AND CONDIC ACCUSED SANADER OF \"HIGH TREASON.\" 
 
6.  (SBU) INITIAL PUBLIC REACTIONS TO THE GOC\'S DEMONSTRATION 
OF COMMITMENT TO COOPERATION WITH ICTY ARE POSITIVE.  ICTY 
SPOKESWOMAN FLORENCE HARTMANN TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE COURT 
WELCOMES THE \"ENCOURAGING STEP\" AND THAT \"PROGRESS HAD BEEN 
MADE.\"  SHE ALSO SAID THAT SHE \"EXPECTS CROATIA TO PROCEED 
WITH ALL OTEHR REQUESTS MADE BY THE TRIBUNAL,\" A CLEAR

Croatia is seeking support for a consensus resolution on its 
biennial \"conscientious objection to military service\" 
resolution.  On country-specific resolutions, Croatia 
supports an \"objective evaluation\" without politicization and 
voting through regional blocks. 
 
3. Begin text of non-paper: 
 
CROATIA\'S PRIORITIES AT THE 60th SESSION OF 
THE UN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
The Republic of Croatia attaches great importance to the 
pivotal role of the UN Commission on Human Rights, and as a 
first time member in the period 2002-2004, this year will 
continue to play an active role in its work.  The Permanent 
Representative of Croatia to the UN Ambassador Gordan 
Markotic, has been elected as one of the Vice-Chairmen of the 
Commission. 
 
-In the field of human rights promotion and protection, 
Croatia is firmly committed to the principle that all human 
rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
inter-related. 
 
-Croatia supports the universal ratification of core 
universal human rights treaties, as well as their effective 
implementation at the national level.  This particularly 
refers to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights in the context of which it should be stressed that 
Croatia remains committed to the universal abolition of death 
penalty and the prevention of torture and all forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Croatia has 
signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. 
 
-Croatia pays particular attention to the further 
strengthening of the implementation of economic, social and 
cultural rights.  In this context, it supports the early 
commencement of work related to the elaboration of a draft 
optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights related to an optional 
communications procedure for individuals or groups claiming 
to be victims of the violation of the rights contained in the 
Covenant. 
 
-Croatia remains committed to the further strengthening of 
the mechanisms for the protection of human rights within the 
UN system.  It firmly believes that the strengthening of 
effectiveness of these mechanisms and their streamlining is 
crucial for the protection and promotion of human rights 
worldwide. In this respect, Croatia extended a standing 
invitation to the thematic special procedures in 2003 and 
invites the countries that have not done so to do the same. 
 
-Croatia renders its full support to the ongoing activities 
related to the reform of the human rights treaty system, the 
achieving of increased co-ordination and closer co-operation 
among the treaty bodies leading to the strengthening of the 
human rights protection at the national and international 
levels. 
 
-At this session, the Republic of Croatia will present its 
biennial resolution entitled \"Conscientious Objection to 
Military Service\" which is important in the context of the 
freedom of opinion, freedom of conscience, freedom of belief 
as well as the right not to be discriminated. 
 
-Croatia will continue to support the efforts within the 
Commission on Human Rights aimed at the integration of gender 
perspective in all of its activities.  Paying particular 
attention to gender equality as an important objective, 
Croatia considers the work of the Special Rapporteur of the 
Commission on Human Rights on violence against women 
particularly important for achieving this goal. 
 
-The Republic of Croatia attaches significant importance to 
the process of adopting resolutions considering the fact that 
the role of the members of the Commission is crucial for the 
future protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. 
Consequently, Croatia: 
 
 
--supports the adoption of thematic resolutions by consensus 
over the increasing trend of adopting them by voting. 
Members should commit themselves to adequate preparation of 
the texts of resolutions and appropriate negotiations; 
 
--supports the ongoing initiatives regarding the improvement 
of the organization of work of the Commission and the call 
for biennialization or triennalization of resolutions that 
provide added value aimed at the promotion and protection of 
human rights; 
 
--supports the objective evaluation of country resolutions 
without politicization and voting through regional blocks, 
since such voting undermines the resolutions\' key aim of 
unbiased assessment of specific human rights situations in 
the observed countries.

End summary. 
 
2.   (C) Croatia\'s press is reporting that the GoC expects 
the imminent arrival of new indictments against several 
Bosnian Croats for actions in BiH in 1993-1994.  According to 
local press reports, two of the likely indictees -- Milivoj 
Petkovic and Slobodan Praljak -- met with Justice Minister 
Vesna Skare Ozbolt on March 16 and reportedly said that they 
will agree to be transferred to The Hague when served with an 
indictment.  Both Petkovic and Praljak reside in Zagreb (see 
ref a). 
 
3.  (C) We met on March 17 with Jaksa Muljacic, Assistant 
Justice Minister in charge of ICTY Cooperation.  While he 
could not confirm \"officially\" that Skare Ozbolt met with 
Milivoj Petkovic and Slobodan Praljak, he said he did not 
anticipate any problems with the two giving themselves up. 
If they balk, \"we will arrest them.\"  There is no other 
choice for Croatia. 
 
4.   (C) Muljacic just returned from The Hague where he met 
with Carla del Ponte.  He said the Tribunal officials he met 
were happy with the GOC\'s cooperation to date.  The 
government had successfully transferred Mladen Markac and 
Ivan Cermak.  While there were no guarantees, Muljacic said 
Carla del Ponte had assured him informally that the two would 
be released pending a trial date.  The Trial Chamber would 
have to make this decision, but absent any concerns by the 
Prosecutor\'s office, it would likely come quickly -- probably 
within a matter of weeks. 
 
5.   (C) Muljacic said the government had some problems with 
the contents of the indictments against Cermak and Markac, 
particular the references to the existence of a \"joint 
criminal enterprise\" in connection with Operation Storm, but 
would address them through legal channels.  However, he 
stressed that such issues would not get in the way of full 
cooperation with ICTY.  The government Council on Cooperation 
with the Tribunal, which is chaired by the Justice Minister, 
was scheduled to meet on March 17 to discuss in what form to 
state the government\'s concerns about the Cermak and Markac 
indictments, if at all.  \"There\'s plenty of time for that,\" 
Muljacic said.  He does not expect a trial for up to another 
two years. 
 
6.  (C) He dismissed a report in Zagreb-weekly Nacional that 
the GoC aimed to have Cermak and Markac prosecuted in a 
domestic war crimes trial.  The trial will be in The Hague, 
and there will be no effort to change the venue. 
Nonetheless, the government has committed itself to boosting 
its capacity to prosecute war crimes cases in Croatia, 
although trials would be of a much lower profile than the 
names on indictments that have been seen so far.  Muljacic 
anticipates eventually some 20 such cases being prosecuted 
domestically. 
 
7.   (C) On Gotovina, Muljacic said that he discussed the 
report on what steps the GOC was taking to apprehend Ante 
Gotovina with Carla del Ponte.  He did not show us a copy, 
but indicated that the report, about 30 pages in length, 
would go a long way to demonstrate that Gotovina is not 
likely in Croatia at this time.  Del Ponte told him that her 
office would look at it closely, and there would likely be 
many follow up questions.  Any official reaction would follow 
that. 
 
 
8.   (C) In a separate meeting on March 11 with Tom Osorio, 
head of the Zagreb ICTY Liaison Office, he told us that the 
Tribunal was very pleased with the extent of cooperation 
shown so far by the new authorities in Croatia.  He ticked 
off a number of areas where the government was doing exactly 
what it should be doing, described Ozbolt\'s can-do posture on 
cooperation, and said he hoped -- and expected -- that good 
relations would continue this way.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Foreign Minister Zuzul told the Ambassador on March 
22 that the GoC would do everything it could to ensure 
Croatian citizens indicted by ICTY for crimes in Bosnia were 
transferred to The Hague, but could not guarantee that the 
process would go as smoothly as in the cases of Cermak and 
Markac.  Zuzul said that the \"most logical and efficient\" way 
for the GoC to receive the indictments would be for the 
Government of BiH to present a formal request to the GoC for 
assistance in execution.  Zuzul said that the GoC is still 
considering its options to raise more forcefully its 
objections to the text of the recent indictments against 
Cermak and Markac (ref b).  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) On March 22, the Ambassador met with Croatian Foreign 
Minister Miomir Zuzul to discuss aspects of an upcoming trip 
to the U.S.  The Ambassador used the opportunity to remind 
Zuzul that the international community expects Croatia to 
continue to cooperate fully with the ICTY in the case of 
indictments against a number of Bosnian Croats.  Croatia\'s 
track record of cooperation with the Tribunal was greatly 
improved by the GoC\'s management of indictments against Ivan 
Cermak and Mladen Markac, both of whom surrendered to ICTY 
custody on March 11. 
 
3.  (C) Zuzul reiterated the Sanader government\'s commitment 
to full cooperation with ICTY, but pointed out that not all 
aspects of the indictments against the Bosnian Croats are 
under GoC control, as they were with Cermak and Markac.  In 
the latter case, GoC was able to \"manage the process\" of the 
indictments to exclude any outcome other than the prompt 
transfer of the PIFWCS to The Hague.  Zuzul said that since 
several of those expected to be named in new indictments of 
Bosnian Croats are Croatian citizens and reside in Croatia, 
the GoC is ready to cooperate, but the process may not be as 
smooth. 
 
Croatia Seeks \"Formal Requests\" from GoBiH 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Zuzul said that the method by which the GoC is asked 
to help secure indictees\' transfer is important.  After all, 
Zuzul explained, if our shared goal is to support the 
development of BiH as a sovereign state, we should follow the 
appropriate form.  Croatia seeks formal requests from the 
government in Sarajevo for assistance in delivering the 
indictments and transferring indictees. 
 
Objecting to Language Doesn\'t Mean \"Not Cooperating\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5.  (C) Zuzul said that the GoC was still considering how 
best to voice its objections to the language in the Cermak 
and Markac indictments.  The GoC had concluded that its 
status as \"amici curiae\" might not be strong enough.  The 
Cermak and Markac indictments had crossed the line from being 
an indictment of individuals to an accusation against 
Croatia; Croatia should have the right to defend itself 
separately from the individuals.  Zuzul said that one 
U.S.-based adviser told him that the Prosecutor\'s 
inappropriate characterization of Croatia\'s war might end up 
helping the indictees.  (Note: the text of the indictments 
used the term \"joint criminal enterprise\" to describe parts 
of Croatia\'s war of independence and named former President 
Tudjman as an accomplice.  End Note.)  Zuzul said that PM 
Sanader is doing his best to keep political grandstanding 
about the indictments to a minimum.  So far, the GoC has 
avoided an open debate in the Sabor, but it may not be long 
before this issue is given a more public airing. 
 
6.  (C) Zuzul said that PM Sanader had sent the President of 
the Court a letter (with a copy to Chief Prosecutor del 
Ponte) voicing GoC objections to the text of the indictment. 
Zuzul was quick to point out that this line of action must 
not be seen as a deviation from the GoC\'s resolve to continue 
full cooperation with the Tribunal, but rather as a separate 
track.  Other moves on this track include a meeting between 
Justice Minister Vesna Skare Ozbolt and, eventually, a 
 
meeting for FM Zuzul with the President of the Court.  When 
the latter meeting is scheduled, Zuzul concluded, Croatia 
will make a more formal representation to the USG. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C) Zuzul clearly knows that the Sanader government\'s 
cooperation with ICTY is under an international microscope, 
and we expect Croatia will act in a way that will not 
negatively affect Croatia\'s aspirations for integration into 
Euro-Atlantic institutions.  While Zuzul\'s preference for a 
formal request for assistance from the GoBiH likely stems 
more from his Government\'s desire for a small measure of 
political cover rather than its desire to respect the state 
institutions of BiH, he has a point.

Summary 
 ------- 
 
1.   (C) In a meeting on March 27 with the Ambassador 
arranged to discuss a Croatian proposal to refit a Libyan 
military vessel (ref), Croatian President Stipe Mesic spent 
most of his time discussing his recent visit to the Middle 
East.  He said he had a very full schedule of meetings in 
Damascus, Amman, and Doha.  He described a world of 
difference between a \"gloomy\" Syria on the one hand and a 
more vibrant and \"happy\" Jordan and Qatar on the other.  He 
met with the leaders of all three countries and was 
optimistic about boosting economic contacts.  In Syria, 
Croatia\'s national oil company, INA, has made an important 
discovery in fields east of Damascus.  In a one-on-one 
meeting with President Assad, Mesic urged the Syrian leader 
to accept the reality of Israel and oppose terrorism.  End 
summary. 
 
Jordan and Qatar Bustling 
------------------------- 
 
2.   (C) President Mesic briefed the Ambassador March 27 
about his recent trip to the Middle East.  He said it went 
well, and that he was optimistic about increased Croatian 
trade with the three countries that he visited.  He was 
particularly upbeat about his stops in Jordan and Qatar.  In 
Jordan, he met with King Abdullah.  It was Mesic\'s third 
visit to Amman.  The country is \"opening up.\"  Mesic 
described a lively place unlike any other Arab country. 
Croatia should look at Jordan\'s experience with free trade 
zones as a possible model to be adopted back home to spur 
investment and commerce in Croatia\'s war affected regions. 
He was pleased to tell the Ambassador that a Jordanian 
business delegation would travel to Croatia later this year 
to look at opportunities.  Also, King Abdullah told him that 
he wants to increase university-level exchanges between the 
two countries. 
 
3.   (C) In Qatar, Mesic met with the Emir.  The Croatian 
president saw a similarly vibrant place.  Doha was bustling. 
Croatian companies were interested in investing in Qatar\'s 
cement industry.  The Qataris want to promote more exports of 
natural gas to Europe and are looking to invest in a facility 
to transship liquefied natural gas (LNG), primarily to Italy, 
Slovenia, and Croatia.  Ploce is one possible location for a 
facility, but most of the talk now is of making an investment 
in Krk, an island just off of Croatia\'s primary port of 
Rijeka, in the northern Adriatic.  According to Igor Dekanic, 
who in addition to being Mesic\'s top domestic policy advisor 
is an oil industry expert, an LNG facility must be on highly 
stable ground, and Krk is probably the best -- if not only -- 
site in the Adriatic.  Mesic was optimistic about Krk\'s 
prospects.  He told the Ambassador that the Emir wants to pay 
a visit to Croatia in early July. 
 
Syria Gloomy 
------------ 
 
4.   (C) Syria was the most problematic stop for Mesic on his 
swing through the region.  The country was \"gloomy\" and 
reminded the president of Croatia back in the seventies, 
statist in orientation, and depressing.  Mesic said he met 
alone with President Assad and -- as he promised he would do 
when he met the Ambassador prior to the trip  -- conveyed USG 
concerns about the Syrian regime.  Assad came across as a 
\"civilized man\" who inherited a creaky and repressive state 
apparatus.  The Syrian president seemed to be resolved in his 
desire to carry out reforms, but it was difficult.  Mesic 
underscored with Assad that the Syrian regime should 
\"recognize reality,\" including the \"reality of Israel.\"  It 
was an illusion to think otherwise.  Mesic said he tried to 
steer the conversation in this direction, but it was clear 
that taking such a course \"was not easy for Assad.\"  Mesic 
said the Syrian president needed to be \"engaged more\" by 
western interlocutors.  Assad will have to \"break the regime 
structures\" he inherited from his father.  According to 
Mesic, Assad denied any links to -- or cooperation with -- 
terrorist organizations. 
 
5.   (C) Mesic\'s more immediate purpose in visiting Syria was 
to look at the progress of INA, the Croatian national oil 
company, which has made a major discovery in Syria.  Dekanic 
told us later that INA\'s investment was modest by western 
standards, only $80 million, but there are some 500 Croatians 
now on the ground in Syria, and this was a big breakthrough 
 
for the Croatian company.  Mesic indicated that Assad was 
ready to open the doors to more business exchanges.  Croatia 
was in the process of opening up an honorary consulate in 
Damascus.  Overall, however, Syria was in a \"difficult\" 
economic situation, and opportunities for Croatian companies 
were not nearly as great as they were elsewhere in the Middle 
East.

SUBJECT: SERBS PLAYING POLITICAL HARDBALL ON RETURN ISSUES 
 
Classified By: POLOFF Mitch Benedict for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Disappointed with GOC implementation of promises to 
address refugee return issues, Serb politicians threatened on 
March 23 to withdraw their informal support for PM Sanader\'s 
government.  Sanader responded immediately and met with 
Milorad Pupovac, one of three MPs representing the Serb 
minority in Croatia\'s parliament and agreed to concrete 
benchmarks on property repossession, reconstruction 
assistance and minority representation in local government 
bodies.  Sanader and Pupovac agreed on a bureaucratic 
mechanism intended to bypass a long-standing obstruction to 
returns.  Pupovac genuinely believes Sanader is trying to do 
the right thing.  He told us on March 26 that he supports 
\"with no reserves and no conditions\" the PM\'s efforts to 
reform both the GOC and the HDZ.  Sanader\'s efforts to 
deliver quick results on this issue may run aground on the 
rocks of Croatia\'s still foundering judicial system, which 
would be responsible for ordering evictions of ethnic Croat 
\"squatters\" in homes belonging to Serb refugees.  Pupovac set 
optimistic benchmarks by which he will measure GOC 
implementation of commitments.  End Summary. 
 
Serbs Dissatisfied 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) On March 23, Milorad Pupovac, president of the Serb 
National Council and one of three members of Croatia\'s 
parliament designated to represent the Serb minority, 
announced to the press that he was dissatisfied with the 
government\'s implementation of its pledges to move forward on 
refugee issues.  Pupovac threatened that the three Serb MP\'s 
were prepared to withdraw their support for PM Sanader in the 
absence of concrete results.  Although traveling in Europe, 
PM Sanader contacted Pupovac right away and set up an urgent 
meeting with Serb leaders.  While Sanader leads a minority 
government and needs the support of the three Serb votes in 
parliament, the greatest value he gains by his party\'s 
informal coalition with the Serbs is credibility; they 
demonstrate to the EU and other skeptics that Sanader\'s HDZ 
is no longer the ethnocentric party of former President 
Tudjman. 
 
Commission Established 
---------------------- 
 
3. (C) After meeting with the SDSS on March 25, Sanader 
announced that the GOC had formed a commission to resolve 
return and property issues and that it would be headed by 
former MP and hard-line HDZ member Gordana Turic.  Sanader 
proposed the commission in part because he was unwilling to 
remove Lovre Pejkovic, the Assistant Minister who has been in 
charge of the property repossession issue for six years.  The 
SDSS alleges that Pejkovic is not only tainted by allegations 
of corruption and is viewed by many as an obstacle to return 
and the resolution of property issues, but he worked actively 
to oppose the appointment of Stanko Janic (an ethnic Serb) as 
Assistant Minister for reconstruction. 
 
4. (C) The latest addition to the commission, which was 
recently reported to consist of 14 members, is Vladimir 
Stengel, the hard-line and long-serving HDZ mayor of Vukovar. 
 The appointment of Stengel, even more than Turic, provides 
ample pause for concern.  Stengel, an ardent Croat 
nationalist, has presided over a virtual stalemate in 
Vukovar, a city that has begun to reconstruct, albeit slowly, 
but remains tensely divided along ethnic lines.  However, 
Sanader believes his government should be judged by its 
results rather than rhetoric, and his strategy may be that 
only hard-liners, motivated by the desire to stay in power 
and promise of leading Croatia toward its Euro-Atlantic 
aspirations, can force compliance on refugee return issues 
among the lower level bureaucrats and local and regional 
officials. 
 
Property Repossession 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) The Government\'s agreement with the SDSS called for 
the elimination of \"legal and other obstacles to the 
repossession of property owned by institutions of the Serb 
national community.\"  Repossession of private property by 
individuals was not specifically addressed, but has become a 
central benchmark now being used by the SDSS to measure 
cooperation with the Government.  A key area for concern is 
properties that are occupied illegally, either because the 
temporary occupant never had official approval or is in 
 
possession of alternative accommodation.  These so-called 
\"illegal/double occupants\" now currently number about 500. 
Approximately 3,200 legally occupied houses (under the 
war-time law on temporary occupancy) are to be returned by 
year\'s end. 
 
6. (C) Pupovac, who cited a figure of 430 illegally occupied 
properties, told us that the SDSS is demanding that all 
illegal/double occupants vacate properties by the end of 
June.  They expect 150 properties to be returned to their 
rightful owners in April, 150 in May, and the balance in 
June.  Pupovac said it was unconscionable that situations 
exist whereby an ethnic Croat from Bosnia is occupying a 
Serb\'s house in Croatia yet the Croat has gotten 
reconstruction assistance in Bosnia to rebuild his house 
there, which he is now renting and using the income to 
purchase a place on the coast of Croatia.  The SDSS is 
pushing the Sanader Government to establish a coordination 
mechanism with Serbia Montenegro and Bosnia Herzegovina so 
that such situations can be detected and avoided. 
 
7. (C) The OSCE Mission has told us they view the SDSS 
timetable as unobtainable and unrealistic.  Some 99 percent 
of cases of illegal/double occupancy are before the courts 
awaiting action, meaning there could be no change in the 
status quo until the completion of such action; in addition, 
a court order would be required to evict an illegal/double 
occupant -- which is doubtful given the still growing backlog 
of over 1.4 million cases clogging the judicial system.  The 
inability of the judicial system to resolve these emotionally 
charged yet simple cases is highlighted by the fact that 
resolution of cases (and approximately 200 have been resolved 
since January 1) occurs extra-judicially by agreement between 
the occupier and the owner.  Ratko Gajica, an SDSS MP, 
admitted to us that illegal/double occupants are going to 
vacate only if pressured to do so by the government. 
 
Reconstruction Assistance 
------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The agreement between the SDSS and the Government 
speaks extensively to the issue of reconstruction assistance. 
 The GOC agreed to the administrative resolution of all 
requests on hand by the end of April.  In addition, the 
agreement commits the GOC to extend the current deadline of 
June 2004 for submission of requests for reconstruction 
assistance.   According to the OSCE there are currently 
10,500 applications for reconstruction assistance on file 
with the GOC, and of those they expect approximately 7,500 
positive decisions.  The remaining 3,000 applications are 
incomplete, and could be closed immediately, according to the 
GOC. 
 
9. (C) Pupovac, who is not known for his exactness of 
numbers, spoke of 7,000 applications that were incomplete. 
Regardless of the number, the issue for Pupovac is to find 
out why the applications are incomplete so that appropriate 
efforts can be made to complete the applications.  He 
recognizes that the applicants themselves are at least partly 
to blame for the high number of incomplete applications; 
information gleaned from the OSCE would in fact lay most of 
the blame on the applicants.  For example, last year as a 
follow up, the GOC sent 2,000 letters to applicants seeking 
clarifications and additional information; only a few hundred 
applicants responded.   According to the OSCE, the GOC is in 
possession of 17,000 unprocessed applications, which is 
compounding the problem.  On March 26, the GOC extended the 
deadline for submitted reconstruction assistance requests to 
September 30. 
 
CLNM Implementation 
------------------- 
 
10. (C) A significant part of the agreement between Sanader 
and the SDSS related to implementation of the Constitutional 
Law on National Minorities (CLNM).  Sanader committed to 
bringing local and regional self-government units into 
compliance with the provisions of the CLNM by March 18.  He 
also committed by March 18 to provide the funds and establish 
the conditions for the election and work of Serb national 
minority councils at the local, municipal, and county levels. 
 Elections for minority councils took place in February; 
funding and other issues remain unresolved. 
 
11. (C) Full implementation of the CLNM would bring two 
significant benefits for minorities: political participation 
at the local and regional level and jobs.  Political 
participation of the Serbian minority and jobs being what 
they are -- either in short supply or a particularly touchy 
subject seven years after an ethnically based war -- these 
 
provisions of the law have not been implemented since the law 
was passed in December 2002.  Nonetheless, the law requires 
that county, municipal, and town councils include ethnic 
minorities proportionally.  Pupovac and the SDSS are 
demanding steps be taken to implement this commitment, which 
will in many cases open the doors for the first time to 
political participation for minorities at the local and 
regional level. 
 
12. (C) Remarkably the Racan Government appears to have never 
even attempted to implement the CLNM at the local and 
regional level.  The GOC is now drafting regulations for 
implementation and accompanying guidelines for municipalities 
and counties.  Pupovac told us the SDSS is not demanding 
everything at once, but it would be content for now if the 
GOC would meet with the county prefects and begin a process 
of developing regulations for implementation of the CLNM. 
Actual implementation could then take place over a six-month 
period. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (C) We asked Pupovac directly how he is going to measure 
success.  He cited figures on the return of property and 
talked about implementation of the CLNM, but what really 
animated him was talk about personalities.  He said that the 
people who for years obstructed the return of refugees \"have 
to be dealt with\" -- and he is correct.  There is no doubt 
that individual obstruction by government officials has 
significantly held back the resolution of refugee return and 
reintegration issues. 
 
14. (C) There is a new urgency to settling issues resulting 
from the 1991-1995 war.  Many feel that only the HDZ -- the 
party in power during and after the war -- would have the 
authority to deal with the hard-liners who have been 
obstructing progress on refugee return and reintegration 
issues.  However, Sanader has to maintain a delicate 
balancing act.  He must keep his right-wing nationalist base 
placated while at the same time sufficiently fulfilling his 
agreement with the SDSS to retain their support in 
parliament. 
 
15. (C) Like the OSCE, we do not expect the GOC to be able to 
resolve all the issues in the agreement with the SDSS by the 
deadlines established.  Where the SDSS draws the line remains 
to be seen; for now Pupovac genuinely believes Sanader is 
trying to do the right thing.  He told us on March 26 that he 
supports \"with no reserves and no conditions\" the PM\'s 
efforts to reform both the GOC and the HDZ.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO STRIKE A COMPROMISE POSITION

IF LABELED, BUT THAT CROATIA WOULD REMAIN \"GMO FREE\" BECAUSE 
SOWING OF GM CROPS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS

WERE FAIRLY MATTER-OF-FACT -- NON-LABELED GMOS HAVE BEEN 
FOUND IN FOOD.  SOME NEWS PROGRAMS EVEN NOTED THAT NO 
HARMFUL EFFECTS OF GMOS HAD BEEN PROVEN.  HOWEVER, THE MERE 
FACT THAT GMOS WERE FOUND PROMPTED A PUBLIC OUTCRY.  GREENS 
PORTRAYED THE RESULTS AS VINDICATION OF YEARS OF DIRE 
WARNINGS, AND RENEWED CALLS FOR A TOTAL BAN ON BIOTECH. 
(IRONICALLY, GMOS WERE ALREADY DE FACTO BANNED.  WHILE A LAW 
HAD BEEN PASSED ALLOWING THE IMPORT OF GMOS ONCE REGISTERED 
AND LABELED, IN THE ABSENCE OF REGULATIONS, NO PERMITS COULD 
BE ISSUED.)  AS A RESULT OF THE FUROR, CONSUMERS THREATENED 
TO SUE COMPANIES THAT DID NOT LABEL GMOS, CONSUMER GROUPS 
DEMANDED THAT THE COMPANIES IN QUESTION BE PUNISHED, 
PRODUCERS THREATENED THE LAB FOR PUBLISHING PARTIAL 
INFORMATION, SUPERMARKETS PLEDGED TO WITHDRAW THE FOOD 
CONTAINING GMOS, AND THE SANITARY INSPECTION SERVICE 
TIGHTENED UP INSPECTIONS ON THE BORDER, REQUESTING GMO-FREE 
CERTIFICATES FOR FRESH PRODUCE AND COMMODITIES, TAKING 
SAMPLES, ETC. 
 
4.  (SBU) A CONTACT IN PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES HEADQUARTERS 
FUMED TO US THAT THE LAB IN OSIJEK HAD ACTED IRREGULARLY AND 
IRRESPONSIBLY.  IN THE ABSENCE OF REGULATION OF LAST YEAR\'S 
FOOD LAW, THERE WERE NO GUIDELINES FOR TESTING.  HE

5.  (U) THE ZAGREB PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE INITIALLY CROSS

BECAUSE THE OSIJEK LABORATORY DID NOT WANT TO SHARE ITS

FIVE HAD TRACES OF GMOS, AND SEVEN HAD NO GMOS.  AFTER THE 
ZAGREB LAB WAS FINALLY ABLE TO OBTAIN SAMPLES FROM THE 
OSIJEK LAB, AN ISO-CERTIFIED LABORATORY IN BERN PROVED THAT

LABORATORY WAS WRONG. 
 
6.  (U) THE ONE PRODUCT SAMPLE WITH OVER ONE PERCENT OF GMO

SUBSIDIARY OF THE SLOVENIAN COMPANY, PERUTNINA PTUJ.  THE 
SAUSAGE CONTAINED SOY EXTRACT THAT WAS PROBABLY BOUGHT FROM 
A DUTCH COMPANY WITH OFFICES IN ZAGREB.  THE MEDIA REPORTED

THE GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO STRIKE A COMPROMISE POSITION 
PUBLICLY, BY SAYING THAT IMPORTS OF GMOS WOULD BE PERMITTED, 
IF LABELED, BUT THAT CROATIA WOULD REMAIN \"GMO FREE\" BECAUSE 
SOWING OF GM CROPS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
ADOPTED THE EU-APPROVED LIST OF GM PRODUCTS AND THE EU

QUALITY-BIOTECHNOLOGY TESTING LABORATORY.  ONE OF ONLY TWO 
BIOTECH TESTING LABS IN CROATIA, THE FACILITY LACKS ISO 
CERTIFICATION.  IT TESTED 33 FOOD SAMPLES FOR QUALITY AND

PRESENCE HAD TO WITHDRAW IT FROM THE MARKET (THEY DID SO 
VOLUNTARILY), AND MAY BE PUNISHED FOR NOT LABELING GMO

CONTAINING ACCIDENTAL OR TECHNOLOGICALLY UNAVOIDABLE TRACES 
OF ALLOWED GMO AT THE LEVEL OF 0.9 PERCENT OR LESS IN A 
PRODUCT OF ONE INGREDIENT, OR 0.9 PERCENT OR LESS OF 
ALLOWED GMO OF EACH INGREDIENT OF THE PRODUCT, NEED NOT BE

DECLARE THE COUNTRY OR A REGION \"GMO-FREE,\" ALTHOUGH THE LAW 
ON PROTECTION OF NATURE DOES HAVE PROVISIONS TO DECLARE 
CERTAIN AREAS GMO-FREE TO PROTECT NATURE PRESERVES, TOURISM 
OR ORGANIC PRODUCTION.  THAT DID NOT STOPPED ISTRIA COUNTY

Summary 
------- 
 
1.   (C) The new Croatian government is doing everything it 
can to keep its EU and NATO bids on track and forge better 
ties with the U.S.  Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul conveyed 
confidence in a dinner on April 1 with the Ambassador and 
EUR/SCE Director Chuck English.  He said the Prime Minister\'s 
trip to Washington last week went \"extremely\" well.  They 
were grateful for the President\'s supportive remarks at the 
NATO ceremony at the White House.  The new HDZ-led government 
was cooperating with the War Crimes Tribunal \"100 percent,\" 
and Carla del Ponte seemed to be very happy (septel).  The 
government remained commited to deliver any indictees to The 
Hague that it could, including the five Bosnian Croats whose 
indictments the court just issued. 
 
2.   (C) The GOC spoke with one voice.  PM Sanader was 
completely supportive of Washington\'s Iraq policy and would 
do what it could to play a role -- although the opposition in 
parliament limited its options.  The Ambassador and English 
urged the government to contribute troops to the new 
protection force for the UN pressence in Iraq (ref).  Zuzul 
said he would take the matter up with the prime minister (see 
para 5).  Zuzul was confident the government would meet its 
commitments to Croatia\'s Serbian community on property and 
refugee issues.  End summary. 
 
3.   (C) In a wide-ranging discussion over dinner April 1, 
Foreign Minister Zuzul told the Ambassador and visiting 
EUR/SCE Director Chuck English that the prime minister\'s 
visit to the U.S. went extremely well.  PM Sanader was 
delighted with the remarks of the President at the White 
House Accession ceremony for the seven newest NATO members 
and three aspirants, including Croatia, Macedonia and 
Albania.  The president had more words of encouragement for 
the aspirants than for the new members, Zuzul, who 
accompanied the PM, said.  The prime minister was delighted 
in a pull aside with the President to hear praise for 
Sanader\'s position on the Iraq war and terrorism.  While 
SecDef Rumsfeld was unable to meet separately with Sanader, 
the PM had three separate encounters with Rumsfeld and was 
pleased with the words of encouragement. 
 
4.   (C) Zuzul said that the GOC\'s commitment to getting into 
NATO as fast as possible remained firm, although interest in 
Alliance membership generally had declined in Croatia.  The 
government looked forward to the visit of NATO Secretary 
General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer sometime in May.  In addition 
to meetings, Scheffer will speak to the Parliament.  Zuzul 
noted that, according to one poll, the public\'s support for 
NATO was down from the upper sixties a few years ago to the 
low fifties now.  The Foreign Minister said that President 
Mesic and some of his key advisors were at best ambivilent 
about membership.  The president is facing elections next 
winter and is not likely to push Alliance membership 
prominently in his election plank.  \"It\'s not popular to talk 
about NATO in Croatia right now.\" 
 
Troops/Assistance to Iraq? 
-------------------------- 
 
5.   (C) Zuzul said that Croatians seem to connect NATO 
membership with the more controversial matter of sending 
troops to Iraq.  The GOC wants to play a helpful role, but 
right now sending troops was extremely unpopular.  Zuzul said 
that while in Washington he talked to experts at Walter Reed 
hospital; the GOC was considering offering medical 
assistance.  Zuzul had in mind making Croatian pediatric 
facilities available to Iraqi children -- if children could 
be transported to Zagreb for care.  Passing points (ref), the 
Ambassador and SCE Director English pressed Zuzul to consider 
contributing troops to a contingent charged with protecting 
what will be a large-size UN mission in Baghdad after the 
transfer of sovereignty in June.  Zuzul said he was 
\"personally\" disposed to the idea, but securing enough 
support would be problematic.  He will consult with the prime 
minister.  Zuzul noted that fear of terrorist reprisals was a 
problem in Croatia -- the president himself, whose support 
would be critical to deliver troops to Iraq, has talked about 
the terrorist threat a number of times, both to the public 
and in private meetings with the government. 
 
ICTY Cooperation 
---------------- 
 
6.   (C) Zuzul stressed that the GOC was doing everything it 
could to cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal.  \"We\'re 
cooperating 100 percent, not 90 percent.\"  He said he was on 
 
 
the phone with Carla del Ponte and the ICTY Liaison Office in 
Zagreb constantly.  Del Ponte told Justice Minister 
Skare-Ozbolt this week that the government\'s efforts 
\"exceeded\" her expectations.  Zuzul underscored that the GOC 
objects to some of the recent indictments that have arrived 
from The Hague -- which characterize aspects of the Homeland 
War as a \"joint criminal enterprise\" -- but would cooperate 
regardless.  The government has helped to deliver two 
indictees already, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac, and has 
consulted with the most recent group of indictees -- 
including Croatian Defense Council (HVO) Military Police 
Chief, Valentin Coric -- and they would go to The Hague on 
April 5.  Zuzul said that this effort was not easy 
politically, but the government had \"no choice.\" 
 
7.   (C) The Ambassador and SCE Director pressed Zuzul hard 
on the need to track down ICTY fugitive Ante Gotovina. 
Authorities must demonstrate that they have \"turned over 
every stone\" in their efforts to apprehend him, English said. 
 Getting Gotovina remained an essential priority in 
Washington and the government must deploy all viable means to 
find him -- and demonstrate as much to the Tribunal.  Zuzul 
countered that the government was doing everything it could 
and would continue to do everything it could -- but it was 
difficult to prove a negative.  \"Nobody would be happier than 
we if Gotovina turned up in The Hague, but I\'m not 
optimistic.\" 
 
Refugees 
-------- 
 
8.   (C) Zuzul said he was much more optimistic that the 
government would enjoy success on its promises concerning 
facilitating the return of ethnic Serb refugees.  PM Sanader 
was in constant touch with the Serb members of Parliament -- 
who are unofficial coalition partners of HDZ -- and would 
fulfill commitments made at the beginning of the HDZ-led 
government\'s mandate.  Issues associated with return of 
refugeess, including property restitution, were vexing, Zuzul 
continued, but unlike with Gotovina, the government has more 
control over the situation and would be able to deliver. 
English noted that much was riding on how well Croatia\'s 
creaky justice sector performed -- a point stressed by our 
OSCE interlocutors in Zagreb.  (Croatian courts suffer from 
enormous backlogs, and police have been slow to follow 
through on evictions in behalf of ethnic Serb property 
owners.)  Zuzul was undeterred.  The government has much more 
control over this issue than over finding Gotovina.

Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
1. (C) On April 5, the Government of Croatia put six new 
Bosnian-Croat ICTY indictees onto a regularly scheduled 
commercial flight to Amsterdam.  Notwithstanding a minor 
misunderstanding regarding the late notice given the GoC 
regarding one of the six, ICTY Head of Office Thomas Osorio 
describes the GoC\'s handling of this group and the previous 
indictments and transfers of Croatians Cermak and Markac as 
\"by the book.\"  Osorio believes that Croatia\'s handling of 
these last eight indictees, along with new candor in the 
search for fugitive Ante Gotovina, marks a turning point in 
Croatia\'s relations with the tribunal and could bode well 
both for further constructive dialogue on Gotovina.  Osorio 
also intimated that should this dialogue remain positive, 
Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte could deliver to the UN 
Security Council a positive report on Croatian cooperation 
with the Tribunal.  END SUMMARY and COMMENT. 
 
New Indictments \"by the Book\" 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Over the last week, the Government of Croatia 
delivered new ICTY indictments to six Bosnian Croat 
indictees.  All six ) former Herceg Bosna (HB) prime 
minister Jadranko Prlic, former Croatian Defense Council 
(HVO) commanders Slobodan Praljak and Milivoj Petkovic, 
former HB Defense Minister Bruno Stojic, fromer HVO Military 
Police commander Valentin Coric, and former head of the 
officer for missing and detained persons of HB Berislav Pusic 
-- are dual citizens of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina 
and were resident in Croatia at the time their indictments 
were delivered.  As promised, all six boarded a regularly 
scheduled commercial flight for Amsterdam the morning of 
Monday, April 5. 
 
3. (C) In a meeting with EUR/SCE Director Charles English 
April 2, the ICTY\'s Head of Office for Croatia, Thomas 
Osorio, described the GoC\'s handling of these indictments, as 
well as those of Croatians Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac 
(reftel), as \"by the book.\"   Osorio noted that the GoC was 
tying its own hands by offering guarantees that Cermak and 
Markac would appear for trial if released from custody, thus 
creating the expectation that similar guarantees would be 
offered for the new indictees. 
 
4. (C) Osorio said the ICTY does not seek such guarantees 
when assessing pre-trial release requests, judging each case 
on three issues: whether the suspect had surrendered 
voluntarily; whether the state involved has a track record 
for cooperating on delivering suspects to the Tribunal; and 
whether the accused was fully cooperating with the court. 
Under these criteria, the Chief Prosecutor had to object to 
Cermak\'s and Markac\'s release and would likely object to the 
release of at least two of the Bosnian Croats. 
 
Turning the Corner on Cooperation? 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) ICTY Chief Osorio told Director English that Croatian 
cooperation with the Tribunal is better than the official, 
ICTY public line of \"so far, so good.\"  He said that the 
issue of cooperation on documentation requests is \"completely 
behind us now.\"  In particular, Osorio praised the 
professional approach of Croatia\'s Justice Minister Vesna 
Skare-Ozbolt.  Osorio praised the role Foreign Minister 
Miomir Zuzul has played, but said he has been urging the 
Croatians to take the MFA out of the picture in handling 
relations with the Tribunal, including further indictments. 
Notwithstanding the political sensitivities in Croatia of 
each new indictment which would likely keep Prime Minister 
Ivo Sanader involved, Osorio said that the best way to 
continue to depoliticize cooperation with the Tribunal would 
be to remove the MFA from the process altogether. 
 
Time for Dialogue on Gotovina 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Osorio said that Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte and 
Prime Minister Sanader had developed a whole new dialogue on 
the issue of fugitive Ante Gotovina.  Although del Ponte had 
been very cautious about engaging in such a dialogue, Osorio 
believed that the Sanader government had earned new trust 
based on its moves since assuming office, including the 
latest Article 59 report recently submitted on its efforts to 
apprehend Gotovina.  Osorio would not discuss with us the 
contents of the report, but noted that this was the first of 
such reports not to be immediately leaked to the media. 
 
Another positive step, according to Osorio, was the recent 
decision of Justice Minister Skare-Ozbolt to give new 
authority on the Gotovina issue to Mladen Bajic, the highly 
respected Chief State Prosecutor.  Osorio said that the del 
Ponte\'s office would be very cautious to avoid being trapped 
into developing a checklist as a basis for the GoC to claim 
it had done everything it could to find Gotovina.  However, 
he reemphasized that the Prosecutor\'s Office now believed it 
could engage in a genuine dialogue with the GoC on Gotovina. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Osorio would not come out and say this directly, but 
he did give us every indication that Chief Prosecutor del 
Ponte was moving toward delivering a positive report to the 
UN Security Council on Croatia.  He indicated that the 
evolving dialogue was moving in a direction that would \"allow 
the prosecutor to say Croatia is doing everything it can do\" 
to find Gotovina.  Although Osorio cautioned that he did not 
yet have the information to say the GoC was doing everything, 
he left us with the strong impression that the GoC and ICTY 
are headed in that direction.

SUBJECT: THE ECONOMY -- SANADER GOVERNMENT\'S ACHILLES HEEL? 
 
Classified By: Economic Officer Isabella Detwiler: Reason: 1.5 (B AND D 
) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) While the Sanader government has scored points on the 
foreign policy and political fronts, it is faltering on the 
economic front.  The government inherited certain economic 
weaknesses, further handicapped itself with slavish campaign 
promises, then shot itself in the foot with weak appointments 
to economic positions.  While the government has been forced 
to recognize that it needs an IMF program, it does not appear 
to have a strategy on how to make the painful changes 
necessary for a new Standby Arrangement.  Despite the 
grumbling of economists and citizens, the markets remain 
unfazed.  End Summary. 
 
Good news/Bad news: Economy Cooling 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) While the IMF and the previous government maintained 
until late into the year an estimate for 2003 GDP growth of 5 
percent, no one was too surprised when it turned out to be 
4.4 percent.  The incoming government\'s official and 
conservative estimate for 2004 of 3.2-3.4 percent also 
reflects the consensus that the economy is cooling.  That 
should be good for the current account deficit and mounting 
foreign debt, but as the government\'s macroeconomist in the 
Ministry of Finance conceded, growth in this range is not 
enough to continue to pull down the unemployment rate.  And 
there is no guarantee that the economy will not slow down too 
fast or too far.  (On a positive note, unemployment has 
continued to fall, and despite claims to the contrary, the 
number of registered unemployed was 10 percent lower in 
February 2004 than a year earlier. 
 
3.  (C) The lower-than-projected growth was not the only bad 
news at the end of year.  For reasons that remain murky, the 
budget was blown in the last few months of the year, mainly 
after the election, but before the new government took over. 
Some \"overspending\" was due to the current government\'s push 
to classify as much spending as 2003 spending as possible in 
areas where there was accounting leeway.  Other overspending 
was due to good weather, which allowed the acceleration of 
road construction.  It also appears that the government 
accelerated the payment of some bills.  The net effect was 
that the final deficit came in a full percentage of GDP over 
the target of 4.5 percent. 
 
4.  (C) Paradoxically, the ratio of government debt to GDP 
has stabilized at about 52 percent, while the foreign debt 
(combined public and private) has continued to soar -- 76 
percent of GDP at the end of 2003, and climbing.  While, as 
the Central Bank governor pointed out last year, some of this 
\"private\" sector borrowing may actually be state-owned 
companies, much of the new debt is a result of local 
subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks bringing in funds to fuel 
a consumption-led boom.  Administrative measures by the 
Central Bank last year to slow the growth in credit by using 
reserve requirements to penalize banks that lent too much 
appear to have been widely circumvented.  \"Loans\" became 
\"leases\" and larger corporate borrowers simply borrowed 
directly from abroad. 
 
5.  (SBU) The current account deficit is showing some signs 
of improvement, but not as rapidly as everyone would like. 
The figure for 2003 is a scary sounding 7.2 percent, but 
reportedly includes a large (1.1 percent of GDP) one-off 
accounting entry, which the Central Bank argues means the 
\"real\" deficit was \"only\" 6.2 percent, just a bit over the 
target of 6.0 percent, and much lower than the 8.5 percent of 
2002.  However, the trade deficit continues to increase, and 
the economy remains dangerously dependent on strong tourist 
seasons to lower the current account deficit. 
 
6.  (C) The Central Bank has been talking up the need for the 
government to use fiscal policy to rein in demand, claiming 
that as an open, euro-ized economy, monetary policy would be 
ineffective in Croatia.  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has 
been working with the IMF on a package that would combine an 
increase in interest rates with tools to prevent excessive 
inflows of capital. 
 
The SBA is Dead; Long live the SBA 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) It became clear early this year that the current 
precautionary Standby Arrangement with the IMF was dead, with 
most of its targets blown by larger or smaller margins.  But 
with a new government in power, newly convinced (by the EU) 
of the wisdom of maintaining and negotiating a new SBA with 
 
the Fund, the IMF found it hard to \"punish\" anyone.  The 
early-March announcement that the SBA was off-track, 
carefully orchestrated by the government and the IMF to 
minimize \"panic,\" was greeted by a collective yawn by 
international markets. 
 
8.  (C) While PM Sanader has decreed that there will be a new 
Standby Arrangement, it is unclear whether he is willing to 
make the sacrifices to reach one.  Negotiations on a new SBA 
should begin the second half of April, with a Board meeting 
in the late summer.  While the IMF appealed to the government 
during the visit of the country director in February not to 
make fiscal decisions that would hem the government in, the 
government has forged ahead with a relatively loose budget, 
delivering partially on expensive pension promises, and 
moving a step closer to an expensive tax cut. 
 
9.  (C) Part of the government\'s determination to attribute 
as much spending as possible to the previous government was 
to establish a high base from which to \"decrease\" government 
spending.  To a certain degree, this has worked.  Before the 
budget was passed in early March, the IMF told us that it 
would not support a spending level of 4.5 percent for 2004, 
since the previous SBA had targeted a deficit of only 3.8 
percent.  At this point, the IMF appears to have given up on 
further cuts this year, but is aiming for an ambitious 3.7 
percent in 2005. 
 
One-Two Punch to the Budget 
--------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Despite the government\'s professed right-of-center 
orientation, the military and police arguably got short 
shrift in the budget process.  Social spending was the most 
lavish, as the government delivered on promises it made to 
the pensioners\' party to secure the support of its three 
seats in the Parliament.  Health and road construction were 
also winners, while increased spending on railroads was 
delayed for at least one year (although there are rumblings 
that some spending may be restarted). 
 
11.  (C) The most distressing development, because of its 
long-term impact and the political difficulty of reversing 
it, is the set of changes made to the pension insurance law 
in March.  The legislation formalized a change in the 
indexation of pensions from a price-wage index to an index 
based solely on nominal wage increases, as well as an 
increase to the base pension.  The tax exemption for 
pensioners was also increased.  These changes alone will 
increase government spending on pensions by 23 billion kuna 
(about $3.8 billion) over ten years, by GOC estimates.  It 
would reverse the previous downward trend in spending on 
pensions as a percent of GDP, increasing spending by almost 
two percent of GDP by 2013.  And this is only part of the 
package promised by Sanader. 
 
12.  (C) The government has promised to submit to Parliament 
by June a package further sweetening the pensions. 
Indexation would be raised again, to a combined index using 
wage and nominal GDP increases, plus a payment of the 
so-called \"pensioners debt,\" which the past government had 
successfully (at least legally) settled.  The stated aim of 
the package is to bring the average pension to 70 percent of 
the average wage.  This would be incredibly generous by 
almost any standard and would gut the recent pension reform, 
which sought to shift people from a failing \"pay-as-you-go\" 
system to individualized retirement accounts. 
 
13.  (C) The problem is particularly acute because of the 
large number of people on pensions -- an incredible 1.1 
million out of a population of 4.4 million and a workforce of 
only 1.7 million.  The average net pension is less than 2000 
kuna, or $350 dollars, which, while not bad by area 
standards, makes arguments that pensions need to be curbed 
politically difficult. 
 
14.  (C) Further complicating the task of lowering the 
deficit and reaching an agreement with the IMF is the VAT 
cut, brainchild of key Sanader advisor Ante Babic.  This will 
cost up to 3 billion kuna.  The cut has surprisingly few 
supporters.  Consumers are skeptical the cut will translate 
into lower prices, economists are skeptical it will stimulate 
business, and even some government officials have indicated 
to us they would have preferred to see a cut in payroll taxes 
to increase competitiveness.  Despite the lack of popular 
support, the parliament took a step in the direction of 
no-return when it passed a law April 2 that committed the 
government to lower the VAT rate from 22 to 20 percent 
beginning January 2005.  So far, efforts to collect 
additional revenues from administrative reform and improved 
tax collection -- identified by Babic as sources to make up 
the shortfall -- appear not to have even gotten off the 
 
drawing board. 
 
Shallow Talent Pool 
------------------- 
 
15.  (C) The economic team -- if it can be called that -- 
does not seem to be functioning.  As far as we can tell, 
there is little coordination.  Deputy Prime Minister in 
charge of the economic portfolio, Dr. Andrija Hebrang, does 
not have a background in either economics or in business.  He 
is embroiled in almost daily battles with the media and the 
medical establishment on issues arising from his \"other job,\" 
as Minister of Health.  Ante Babic, State Secretary in the 
Prime Minister\'s office for Strategic Development, and 
self-described \"mastermind\" of the Sanader government\'s 
economic policy, appears to be increasingly side-tracked. 
After authoring the VAT reduction, the idea to enforce 
central procurement of local input for state-owned shipyards, 
and failing to prevent the giveaway to pensioners, that may 
be just as well.  Finance Minister Suker at least has budget 
hawk instincts, but as a small town mayor and tax collector, 
may not have the inclination or ability to form broader 
economic policy. 
 
16.  (C) Thus the responsibility has had to flow up, to 
Sanader, and down, to State Secretary of the Ministry of 
Finance, Martina Dalic.  Dalic headed the macroeconomist 
department of the Ministry in the previous government, then 
left to become the chief economist at the Croatian branch of 
Raiffheisen Bank.  She is well-respected and has shown 
formidable determination and vigor in trying to whip the 
dysfunctional Ministry of Finance into shape.  However, in 
addition to her other duties, she is now effectively in 
charge of both IMF and World Bank negotiations (Babic having 
been sidelined from the latter).  It is doubtful that she has 
the political weight to demand concessions from Ministers. 
Thus, important decisions will have to be backed by her 
Minister, and in most cases, the Prime Minister. 
 
17.  (C) Meanwhile, Minister of Foreign Affairs Zuzul has 
done more to promote Croatian exports and investment in 
Croatia than the \"invisible\" Minister of Economy Branko 
Vukelic.  The problems in the Ministry of Economy extend 
downward -- key positions have been filled with weak 
candidates, and experienced staff let go.  A strong Minister 
of Transport and Infrastructure, Bozidar Kalmeta, will 
probably be good for Croatia\'s infrastructure development, 
but left unchecked, could put even more strains on the 
budget.  Preliminary signals from our EC counterparts 
indicate that the new Minister of EU Integration -- whose 
ministry has some influence on the pace of overall reforms -- 
Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, may be having difficulty filling 
the large shoes of her predecessor. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
18.  (C) Croatia has had a weak economic team for years, yet 
still experienced respectable economic growth.  It is too 
early to say that the good luck has run out.  However, it is 
clear that the bad decisions of the last few months could be 
the seeds of future crisis if left uncorrected.  The IMF will 
play a key role in giving the government cover to reverse 
itself; one question is whether the IMF can or should bend 
enough to reach an agreement with which the Sanader 
government can live, given the HDZ\'s lack of a majority in 
the parliament.  The World Bank, for now, is insisting that 
the government conclude an SBA with the IMF in order for the 
government to access the goodies of the Programmatic 
Adjustment Loan.  Meanwhile, as the GOC has recently found on 
a bond-selling road trip that the markets continue to smile 
on Croatia, delaying the day of reckoning.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The recent visit of IMF Mission Director to Zagreb 
showed that there is political will (for the moment) to 
conclude a Standby Agreement, but considerable political 
blood will have to be spilled along the way.  While the 
government is figuring out how to backtrack on promises to 
the pensioners, other ministers are announcing plans for 
increased spending.  End summary. 
 
PM: \"Make it So\" 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U) IMF Croatia Mission Director Dimitri Demekas and 
Resident Representative John Norregaard called on the DCM 
April 19.  The purpose of Demekas\' visit to Zagreb was to 
participate in the normal IMF annual review and to lay the 
groundwork for \"real\" negotiations on a new Standby 
Arrangement, which will begin in May. 
 
3.  (SBU) Demekas was heartened by the strong political will 
displayed by the Prime Minister, with whom he had met twice. 
The PM made it clear he was intent on making an SBA happen, 
even though it would mean some pain. 
 
4.  (SBU) Demekas seemed confident that the slowing economy 
would pave the way for an improvement in the current account 
deficit and foreign debt.  He told the government that the 
IMF would want to see some fiscal trimming later this year, 
especially if revenue collection continues to be weak, as it 
has been in the first quarter. 
 
5.  (C) Demekas took a much less firm line on the pension 
issue than have resident representatives of the IMF and the 
World Bank over the last few months.  While it would be very 
unfortunate if the pension giveaways stood, he said, it would 
not be the end of the world, especially if the GOC cut 
spending in other areas.  Also, Demekas felt that the 
government was moving to address the issue.  He had been told 
that the second tranche of pension increases, which the 
government had promised to submit to parliament in June, were 
on indefinite hold.  Also, the package of pension increases 
passed in March might not be as bad as thought. 
 
What Pension Bill? 
------------------ 
 
6.  (C) When Demekas raised the 23 billion kuna (over 10 
years) bill for pensions as a problem in a discussion with 
the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance Suker and State 
Secretary Dalic, he got an astonishing response: \"What are 
 
SIPDIS 
you talking about?  It\'s not going to cost that much.\"  After 
Demekas showed them the official government estimate, they 
claimed they had not been aware of it.  (Note: This frankly 
beggars belief.  The cost estimate was prepared by the 
Ministry of Economy and tracks with independent estimates 
prepared by the Pension Fund and the World Bank.  It was 
posted on the internet and was in the package approved by the 
Cabinet.  Furthermore, the World Bank and IMF have been 
raising alarms for some time.  End Note.) 
 
7.  (C) Suker said the pension changes would only cost 4 
billion kuna.  His explanation is that while the law says 
that now pensions will be indexed to wages (full stop), what 
the law REALLY meant was they would be indexed to REAL wages 
(wage growth adjusted downward to take out inflation).  The 
GOC will try to confirm this interpretation via an 
\"explanatory note\" from by the Parliament. 
 
8.  (SBU) Demekas was also blase about the VAT reduction, 
which he concluded, based on government comments, was a sure 
thing.  Sure, it would have been nice to have started tax 
 
 
reductions in other areas, such as payroll taxes, but as long 
as the government paid for it with spending cuts or other tax 
increases (such as introducing VAT on items currently at 
zero, like bread), it did not really matter. 
 
9.  (SBU) Demekas was pleased with the Prime Minister\'s 
commitment to SBA -- and hoped it would remain steadfast even 
after a positive EC avis, or future (June perhaps) invitation 
to begin negotiations on EU accession.  He doubted that the 
World Bank\'s Programmatic Adjustment Loan by itself would 
provide enough leverage on the GOC to maintain fiscal 
discipline.  As the recent road show to sell government bonds 
demonstrated, the GOC can raise lots of cheap money on its 
own. 
 
IMF Previews Negotiations 
------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) In a close-out meeting latter in the week, Demekas 
told the Prime Minister that the IMF would ask the GOC to 
trim the current year\'s budget by a modest 800 million kuna 
(the total budget is 89.4 billion kuna), and agree to 
decrease next year\'s fiscal deficit to under 3.5 percent of 
GDP.  This would be serious belt-tightening -- a full 
percentage point below this year\'s 4.5 percent deficit.  The 
Prime Minister was apparently receptive.  In the meantime, 
the hyper-active Minister of Transportation is announcing new 
subsidies for construction of fishing boats, and rumors 
abound that cuts in spending for the railroads -- a victory 
for budget hawks -- are about to be reversed. 
 
Comments 
-------- 
 
11.  (C) Demekas appears to have concluded his visit to 
Croatia convinced that the government is committed to signing 
a new Standby Arrangement.  This reflects Sanader\'s 
understanding that an agreement is what the EU wants -- and 
accession to the EU remains front and center for the 
government.  However, if the Arrangement has any teeth at 
all, a heavy political price will have to be paid in order to 
reach it. 
 
12.  (C) Particularly difficult will be walking back from the 
pension promises.  We are skeptical of the way the government 
has apparently chosen to do so -- reinterpreting an already 
passed law in a way that lawyers contacted by the World Bank 
say is contrary to any plain or legal reading of the 
legislation.  Also, changing pension indexation from the 
previous half-price inflation/half-nominal wage increase, to 
an index made up solely of real wage increases, could result 
in no increased benefit or even a decreased benefit to 
pensioners over the old system.  This would understandably be 
considered mendacious and a betrayal by the almost 
twenty-five percent of the Croatian public that receives a 
pension, and their families and friends.  While a frank 
admission that Croatia cannot afford the March pension 
legislation would be painful, it would be more honest.

Summary and Introduction 
------------------------ 
 
1.  (C) PM Ivo Sanader\'s furious, almost frantic, pace for 
his first 100 days in office has produced positive results. 
Most of his government\'s energy has been focused on foreign 
policy, where Sanader and his closest associates had to work 
quickly to convince the skeptics of the \"new HDZ\" who are 
making key decisions about Croatia\'s progress toward 
integration in the EU and NATO.  While ICTY fugitive Ante 
Gotovina remains a key obstacle, the clear highlight of 
Sanader\'s first \"semester\" is Croatia\'s dramatic turnaround 
in cooperation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.  This 
achievement, together with his ability to engage with 
Croatia\'s Serb minority, was enough to win a positive \"avis\" 
on April 21 from the EC on Croatia\'s pending application to 
be accepted as a candidate for membership. 
 
2.  (C) We share the opinion of most of Sanader\'s domestic 
critics that he has spent too little time on the economy.  We 
welcomed his decision to continue Croatia\'s relationship with 
the IMF, but in order to get an agreement with the Fund, 
Sanader may have to renege on some of the promises he made to 
key constituencies, especially to retirees and veterans. 
There have been bumps in the road for Sanader, but none have 
caused his government to lose momentum, a frequent, 
frustrating occurrence during the Racan government\'s tenure. 
 
3.  (C) Sanader\'s government has done well on issues relating 
to the USG\'s broad goals in the region, like addressing \"war 
legacy\" issues, progress toward NATO membership and 
developing better relations with neighbors.  But on strictly 
bilateral issues, Sanader\'s record has been mixed.  While we 
welcomed the government\'s move to ratify a long-overdue 
economic agreement, its weak position in parliament and 
pressure from the EU has forced it to back away from pledges 
to send Croatian troops to Iraq and to sign an Article 98 
agreement.  Nevertheless, we find the new GoC\'s can-do 
attitude and its readiness to engage with us on almost every 
issue a refreshing -- and surprising -- change. End Summary 
and Introduction. 
 
No Time to Lose ... 
------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Ivo Sanader\'s HDZ government took office in late 
December 2003 with a lot to prove and little time to prove 
it.  With Croatia\'s application for EU candidate status up 
for review just four months after coming to office, Sanader 
had to prove to skeptics -- both in EU Capitals and in 
Washington -- that his HDZ is not the corrupt, opaque party 
which gave former President Tudjman the domestic political 
tools to wage ethnic war and run Croatia\'s economy into the 
ground. 
 
5.  (C) Showing a great deal of political savvy and a measure 
of political courage as well, Sanader rejected an offer of 
coalition with Croatia\'s far-right party and worked out a 
deal with the ethnic Serb party in parliament.  The Serbs 
drove a hard bargain, insisting on concrete steps on minority 
issues and setting ambitious benchmarks for the government to 
meet on refugee property restitution.  So far, they are 
pleased with Sanader\'s public call for refugees to return to 
Croatia and his government\'s allocation of budget funds to 
repair Serb houses damaged during the war.  For Sanader, the 
grumbling from a few nationalist members of his party was 
more than offset by the instant credibility he got from 
skeptics on both sides of the Atlantic of his party\'s 
sincerity to resolve refugee issues. 
 
... But Little Time to Get Organized 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) Once in office, Sanader took little time to get his 
government organized before launching his full-court press 
for status as an EU candidate.  Four months after coming to 
power, some lines of responsibility are still not clear.  In 
the first two months of his tenure, Sanader was forced to 
withdraw a number of sub-ministerial appointments which were 
clearly not properly vetted, much to his embarrassment.  In a 
clear effort to avoid the \"revanchist\" label, the Sanader 
government left most mid-level bureaucrats in place.  But on 
almost every important issue, regardless of complexity, 
Sanader and a very small group of close advisers still 
exclude many of the government\'s professional civil servants 
from the policy-making process.  This has led to some 
stagnation on less-urgent matters and some uninformed 
decisions on others.  Particularly on economic issues, 
Croatia suffers from a lack of talented people willing to 
 
 
leave the private sector for government. 
 
Progress on ICTY Cooperation 
---------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The area where the Sanader government has clearly 
made the most dramatic turnaround is in cooperation with the 
ICTY.  Despite its purported best intentions, the Racan 
government\'s track record on this issue was poor.  With his 
wobbly coalition indecisive at the best of times, Racan was 
fearful of reprisal from the right-wing, both in and out of 
his government.  Sanader has no such limitations and in a 
short time has established a clear track record.  His 
government has engineered the transfer of eight indictees to 
ICTY custody and has fulfilled all court document requests. 
 
8.  (C) The best measure of Croatia\'s cooperation with ICTY 
will be the transfer of fugitive indictee Ante Gotovina.  But 
the Sanader government has taken some real steps on this 
issue as well (ref a), and convinced the ICTY Chief 
Prosecutor to deliver a favorable report on GoC cooperation 
to the European Commission in advance of its decision on the 
\"avis.\" 
 
\"NATO or Bust\" -- Real Movement on Defense Reform 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
9.  (C) Sanader\'s drive for EU candidate status has not 
distracted his government from adding more horsepower to 
Croatia\'s NATO bid. Defense Minister Roncevic has announced 
steps to eliminate a large and costly \"standing reserve\" of 
sub-standard soldiers (all of whom are veterans of Croatia\'s 
war of independence).  He has also launched a new Strategic 
Defense Review (in consultation with NATO\'s International 
Staff) and has given instructions to the drafters of the 
Review that Croatia\'s force must be structured not to provide 
for territorial defense, but for making contributions to 
joint peace support operations.  Responding to proposals from 
the USG and others in the region, the MOD has gone further, 
and has proposed to transform its Navy and Air Force, 
retaining only a minimum fighter force for air policing and 
pooling assets with the Interior and Transport Ministries to 
form a coast guard capable of interdicting illicit 
trafficking of all sorts along Croatia\'s long and vulnerable 
coastline. 
 
10.  (C) While the Racan government made a good start on 
defense reforms, it could not afford to appear \"soft on 
defense\" to domestic critics on the right, and therefore 
lacked the political will to make these fundamental changes 
to Croatia\'s force structure.  Sanader\'s HDZ government does 
not have this political Achilles\' heel, and reform is surging 
ahead. 
 
Moving Forward on Everything ... 
-------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) Justice Minister Vesna Skare Ozbolt has injected 
energy and commitment to the tough task of judicial reform. 
She introduced changes to the penal code to criminalize 
trafficking in persons, institutionalized and depoliticized 
Croatia\'s cooperation with the ICTY and has begun to tackle 
the Herculean task of reforming Croatia\'s broken-down 
judiciary.  Skare Ozbolt has also engaged with us to develop 
Croatia\'s domestic capability to prosecute war crimes.  When 
Sanader consolidated three ministries into Bozidar Kalmeta\'s 
Ministry of the Sea, Tourism, Transport and Development, we 
feared that the energetic former mayor was being set up for a 
fall, but he appears up to the task.  Highway construction 
and other infrastructure projects are moving forward at a 
remarkable rate and the government is finally following 
through on commitments to build homes for returning 
dispossessed Serb refugees. 
 
... Except for the Economy 
-------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) By most measures, Croatia\'s economy had \"turned the 
corner\" during the Racan government\'s tenure.  Growth was 
strong, unemployment was beginning to drop, but there were 
lurking weaknesses which had been masked by 
stronger-than-expected performance of the tourism industry. 
Although the markets remain unfazed, Croatia\'s current 
account deficit and ballooning debt (both public and private) 
set off warning bells for many economic observers.  Although 
the previous government never needed to draw on Stand-by 
facilities agreed with the IMF, the GoC benefited from the 
IMF\'s role as an outside auditor and an external discipline 
on the economy.  Sanader\'s decision to renew Croatia\'s 
relationship with the Fund was useful, but the 
belt-tightening the IMF will likely request may mean that he 
will need to renege on some of his more populist campaign 
promises.  (See ref b for more detail.) 
 
 
Relations in the Region 
----------------------- 
 
13.  (C) There were a few observers who thought that the 
return of the HDZ to power in Croatia would slow the steady 
progress toward building good-neighborly relations in the 
region.  Sanader\'s activist foreign policy has put most of 
those fears to rest.  He has kept his distance from the HDZ 
in BiH, as requested by High Representative Ashdown, and 
expressed support for the BiH central government.  He has 
sought to address irritants in Croatia\'s bilateral 
relationship with Slovenia.  Croatia ratified the succession 
agreement on assets belonging to the former Yugoslavia and 
extended a visa-free regime for residents of Serbia and 
Montenegro. 
 
Good Bilateral Vibrations ... 
------------------------------ 
 
14.  (C) During his election campaign, Sanader pledged to 
improve relations with the U.S. to \"balance\" Croatia\'s 
foreign policy and make it less Euro-centric.  Atmospherics 
have certainly changed -- we have immediate access to the top 
levels of the GoC whenever we need it.  Beyond atmospherics, 
Sanader pushed a long-languishing bilateral agreement on 
Intellectual Property Rights through the parliament, despite 
pressure from Croatian pharmaceutical producers.  In addition 
to its military police contribution to ISAF, Croatia is 
preparing to make a civilian contribution to a Germany-led 
Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan.  At the UN 
Commission on Human Rights, Croatia co-sponsored a resolution 
on the Human Rights Situation in Cuba, the first time Croatia 
has ever co-sponsored a country resolution.  Croatia is an 
eager supporter of the Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) and looks to engage more closely on cooperative 
security.  The GoC is also lobbying hard (maybe too hard) to 
improve its standing in Washington, particularly in Congress. 
 
... But \"No\" on Article 98 and Troops to Iraq 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
15.  (C) During the election campaign, Sanader made clear his 
party\'s policy to support an Article 98 agreement and to send 
a Croatian contingent of troops to support operations in 
Iraq.  But the post-election political reality is that he is 
unable to make this policy a reality.  Since his HDZ party 
does not even have a simple majority in parliament (let alone 
the two-thirds majority required to deploy troops abroad), 
Sanader chose not to propose an Iraq deployment to the 
parliament.  However, his government is trying to formulate a 
contribution which shows commitment to U.S. goals but does 
not require legislature approval.  The GoC decision not to 
sign an Article 98 Agreement was a clear response to EU 
pressure.  With Croatia\'s application for candidate status 
still pending and the EU pushing hard for Croatia not to 
sign, FM Zuzul announced that the GoC would not engage in 
negotiations on an Article 98 agreement. 
 
Outlook Good for Long-Term Regional Goals 
----------------------------------------- 
 
16.  (C) While we are disappointed that the new GoC was 
unable to meet commitments on some of our near-term goals, 
our long-term agenda has taken steps forward since the 
Sanader government took office.  First, we think it is 
realistic to hope that Croatia\'s marked improvement in 
cooperation with The Hague might bring other states in the 
region around.  (We understand Ambassador Bond cited 
Croatia\'s transfer of indictees to ICTY when urging BiH 
government officials to improve their record of cooperation 
with the Tribunal.  According to press reports, Serbia and 
Montenegro cabinet member said that the new \"Croatian Model\" 
of cooperation has put \"even more pressure\" on the GoSaM.) 
Second, and perhaps most importantly, with the EU\'s positive 
\"avis,\" Croatia\'s neighbors to the south and east can take 
heart that reforms can pay off.  Third, since progress in 
integration requires good-neighborly relations, we can expect 
that the long process of EU and NATO scrutiny will keep 
Croatia\'s bilateral relations in the region on a positive, 
constructive track.

1. (C) FOREIGN MINISTER MIOMIR ZUZUL SOUGHT A MEETING WITH 
    AMBASSADOR FRANK TO EXPRESS HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE U.S. 
POSITION CONDITIONING SUPPORT FOR CROATIA\'S NATO ENTRY ON THE 
ARREST OF ICTY FUGITIVE ANTE GOTOVINA (REFTELS).  AMBASSADOR 
FRANK RESPONDED THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SURPRISE AS 
THE U.S. HAS LONG STATED THAT FULL COOPERATION WITH THE ICTY 
MEANS THAT GOTOVINA IS ARRESTED AND IN THE HAGUE.  THE 
AMBASSADOR CAUTIONED THAT CROATIA CANNOT ABSOLVE ITSELF OF 
ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO LOCATE AND APPREHEND GOTOVINA BY 
ATTEMPTING TO SHOW THAT GOTOVINA IS NOT IN CROATIA.  FM ZUZUL 
PLANS A PRIVATE VISIT TO THE U.S. MAY 16-18 AND ASKED IF HE 
SHOULD TRY TO SEE THE SECRETARY ONCE AGAIN.  AMBASSADOR 
SUGGESTED THAT WHILE FM ZUZUL COULD USEFULLY MEET WITH

IN WASHINGTON BY SEEKING ADDITIONAL HIGH LEVEL MEETINGS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
SHOCKED, JUST SHOCKED 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) ON MAY 4, AMBASSADOR FRANK MET WITH FOREIGN MINISTER 
MIOMIR ZUZUL TO REINFORCE THE U.S. POSITION ON ICTY FUGITIVE 
ANTE GOTOVINA.  MINISTER ZUZUL EXPRESSED HIS SURPRISE AT THE 
U.S. POSITION THAT CROATIA\'S ENTRY INTO NATO WAS CONDITIONED 
ON THE ARREST AND DELIVERY TO THE HAGUE OF ICTY FUGITIVE ANTE 
GOTOVINA.  ZUZUL SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH WHAT HE 
DESCRIBED AS AN UNHELPFUL APRIL 30 NATO MAP REVIEW IN 
BRUSSELS (REF B), PARTICULARLY AFTER THE POSITIVE EU AVIS, 
WHICH HE THOUGHT HAD ALSO REFLECTED U.S. VIEWS. 
 
3. (C) AMBASSADOR FRANK RESPONDED THAT THE U.S. POSITION 
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SURPRISE AS IT WAS NOT NEW.  THE U.S. 
    HAS ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR THAT FULL COOPERATION WITH THE ICTY 
MEANT THAT GOTOVINA WAS ARRESTED AND DELIVERED TO THE HAGUE. 
ON APRIL 15, ZUZUL HAD BEEN TOLD DIRECTLY BY AMBASSADOR 
PROSPER THAT THE U.S. DID NOT AGREE WITH ICTY CHIEF 
PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE\'S ASSESSMENT THAT CROATIA WAS FULLY 
COOPERATIVE WITH ICTY.  ZUZUL HAD HEARD THE SAME MESSAGE FROM 
THE SECRETARY TWICE ) DURING THEIR PHONE CALL APRIL 16 AND 
IN PERSON IN BERLIN ON APRIL 28 (REF A). 
 
HELP US FIND GOTOVINA 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) ZUZUL SAID HE WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE CURRENT 
SITUATION, AS THE GOC WAS CONVINCED THAT GOTOVINA WAS NOT IN 
CROATIA.  THE GOC WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE POLITICAL 
CONSEQUENCES OF ARRESTING GOTOVINA.  HIS ARREST WOULD PROVIDE 
RELIEF FROM THE CURRENT DEPRESSING POSITION THE GOC WAS IN. 
ZUZUL THEN ASKED FOR U.S. ASSISTANCE IN FINDING GOTOVINA. 
 
5. (C) AMBASSADOR FRANK REMINDED ZUZUL THAT IT WAS INCUMBENT 
ON THE GOC TO FIND GOTOVINA.  IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO ASSERT 
THAT GOTOVINA WAS NOT IN CROATIA.  THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY WAS CONCERNED THAT SOME IN CROATIA BELIEVED THEY 
COULD \"GAME\" THE ISSUE BY WAITING OUT THE ICTY\'S COMPLETION 
STRATEGY.  CROATIA\'S PAST BEHAVIOR -- ON BOBETKO AND GOTOVINA 
) HAD PUT THE BURDEN ON CROATIA TO MATCH ITS WORDS WITH 
ACTIONS.  THE U.S. HAD GONE VERY FAR IN SUPPORTING CROATIA\'S 
NATO ASPIRATIONS.  HOWEVER, GOTOVINA IS AND WOULD REMAIN A 
MAJOR OBSTACLE TO FURTHER U.S. SUPPORT FOR CROATIA\'S NATO 
CANDIDACY.  THE GOC SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD IN THE SEARCH, AS NO 
OTHER COUNTRY COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE CONTACTS AND LEADS 
    THAT COULD LEAD TO GOTOVINA\'S CAPTURE. 
 
ZUZUL\'S PRIVATE TRIP TO U.S. 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (C) FM ZUZUL SAID HE WAS PLANNING A PRIVATE VISIT TO 
BOSTON AND NEW YORK FROM MAY 13 AND WOULD BE IN WASHINGTON 
MAY 16-18 TO DEAL WITH PERSONAL ISSUES.  ZUZUL ASKED WHETHER 
HE SHOULD TRY TO SEE THE SECRETARY AGAIN.  THE AMBASSADOR 
SAID THAT, HAVING JUST SEEN THE SECRETARY, ZUZUL SHOULD NOT 
SEEK ANOTHER MEETING TO GO OVER THE SAME GROUND.  AMBASSADOR 
FRANK SUGGESTED THAT ZUZUL COULD USEFULLY MEET WITH 
AMBASSADOR PROSPER, IN ADVANCE OF PROSPER\'S POSSIBLE NEXT 
VISIT TO CROATIA, IF ZUZUL HAD SOMETHING NEW TO SAY ON 
GOTOVINA.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) GoC officials were both encouraged and disappointed 
with their second annual review by NATO\'s North Atlantic 
Council of Croatia\'s progress towards membership.  They were 
encouraged by new optimism about Croatia expressed by many 
allies, citing that the International Staff\'s report noted 
progress on tough issues.  But GoC officials disheartened by 
what they perceived as a new position by the U.S., Croatia\'s 
former champion at NATO.  Croatian officials believe the USG 
has changed the standard by which it is measuring cooperation 
with ICTY.  We encouraged Croatia to continue its progress 
toward NATO membership, stressed that the U.S. has always 
insisted on full cooperation with international obligations 
and underscored the U.S. Mission\'s message at the NAC (ref a) 
that the continued fugitive status of ICTY indictee Gotovina 
is an obstacle to accession.  End Summary. 
 
Croatia reacts to NATO\'s \"Report Card\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Croatia took away mixed messages from its April 30 
\"26 1\" Membership Action Plan (MAP) progress review at NATO\'s 
North Atlantic Council (NAC).  In the week following the NAC 
meeting, we met with Croatia\'s MAP coordinator Pjer Simunovic 
and with Davor Stier, the lead political officer at Croatia\'s 
mission to NATO.  GoC officials were pleased by most allies\' 
recognition that Croatia was making good progress on 
sensitive issues in the political chapter of MAP.  They 
appreciated the constructive, but tough assessment of the 
work the GoC needs to do on defense reform, military 
downsizing and restructuring and also on judicial reform. 
 
Croatia: USG Moved the Goalposts on ICTY Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3.  (C) According to Steir, the most disheartening message 
came from the U.S. representative to the NAC.  Most Allies 
took note of the ICTY Chief Prosecutor\'s positive assessment 
of Croatia\'s cooperation, noting the immediate transfer of 
eight indictees and the ICTY\'s assessment of full cooperation 
on document requests to the GoC.  According to Steir, it was 
the GoC\'s firm understanding that the USG had previously used 
the ICTY\'s assessment as its own measure of Croatia\'s 
cooperation.  Now that Del Ponte judges Croatia as \"fully 
cooperating,\" Stier continued, the U.S. has changed its 
standard, insisting that Gotovina must be in The Hague before 
the U.S. will allow Croatia to move forward toward 
membership.  Steir reiterated FM Zuzul\'s plea at the NAC that 
Croatia \"must not be held hostage to one man.\" 
 
\"A Blow to Croatia\'s Atlantic Movement\" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Simunovic said that the new U.S. position at the NAC 
was a blow to Croatia\'s Atlanticists and could dampen energy 
in Zagreb for Croatia\'s NATO bid.  The EC\'s \"avis\" was not 
seen as a finish line, but as a starting point.  With this 
concrete signal, Croatia\'s reformers have a new tool with 
which to push ahead on reforms relating to the EU.  According 
to Simunovic, the message to those in Croatia who are 
responsible for managing the NATO bid was the opposite: 
despite GoC efforts and measurable achievements, Croatia is 
no closer to NATO membership. 
 
\"Give Us a \'Carrot\' in the Istanbul Communique, Please\" 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5.  (C) Simunovic and Stier asked for a strong message at the 
Istanbul summit which could re-energize Croatia\'s bid for 
NATO and boost public support for membership the way the EC\'s 
\"avis\" had for Croatia\'s EU bid.  More than anything, 
Simunovic said he fears that the Croatian public could 
develop a \"who needs NATO anyway\" attitude; support for the 
tough reforms which are not part of EU requirements -- 
especially in defense -- could fall away. 
 
6.  (C) Stier said Croatia was considering proposing draft 
language for the Summit communique to various delegations at 
NATO.  He said that proposed language would not include a 
call for an invitation -- Allies have been clear that the MAP 
aspirants should not expect that -- but would suggest that 
heads of state hail the progress of the three and direct the 
NAC to assess their suitability for an invitation after the 
next MAP review cycle in Spring 2005. 
 
7.  (C) For our part, we encouraged Croatia to continue its 
efforts in NATO\'s MAP and to address all of the issues raised 
by allies at the April 30 review.  As always, we reiterated 
to our interlocutors that Croatia should take all measures 
possible to deliver Gotovina to ICTY custody.

THE MAY 19 - 20 ADRIATIC CHARTER PARTNERSHIP COMMISSION 
MEETING.  WE DELIVERED REFTEL TALKING POINTS TO PJER 
SIMUNOVIC, CROATIA\'S POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR NATO ISSUES. 
SIMUNOVIC SAID THAT CROATIA\'S HESITANCE STEMS FROM THE GOC 
DRIVE TO MAKE THE ADRIATIC CHARTER PARTNERSHIP A FUNCTIONAL 
BODY WHICH WILL FOCUS ON ISSUES RELATING TO WORK THE PARTNERS 
ARE DOING IN NATO\'S MAP TO QUALIFY FOR FOR FULL NATO

SHOULD BE MAP-SPECIFIC, NOT ON ACTIVITIES WITH NON-CHARTER

SEPARATE MEETING ON THE MARGINS OF THE ADRIATIC CHARTER EVENT 
INCLUDING THE THREE \"A3\" FOREIGN MINISTERS WITH THE SAM AND 
BIH FOREIGN MINISTERS.  HE REMAINED CONVINCED THAT FULL 
ENGAGEMENT OF THE MINISTERS IN THE COMMISSION\'S ACTIVITIES 
WOULD BE DISTRACTING AND WOULD DETRACT FROM THE POTENTIAL 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE COMMISSION MEETING.  HE SAID HE 
CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THE ADRIATIC CHARTER SHOULD BE

    ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO REGIONAL COOPERATION.\"  WE THANKED 
HIM FOR THE PROPOSAL, AND SAID WE WOULD RELAY ANY WASHINGTON 
REACTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
3.  (C) SIMUNOVIC HAS A POINT: THE INCLUSION OF THE BIH AND 
SAM FOREIGN MINISTERS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE MEETING WOULD 
LIKELY MOVE THE AGENDA AWAY FROM MAP.  BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER 
REASONS FOR CROATIAN FM ZUZUL TO BE LESS THAN EAGER TO MEET 
SAM FM VUK DRASKOVIC.  DRASKOVIC HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO 
ACCOMPANY SAM PRESIDENT MAROVIC TO CROATIA ON AN OFFICIAL 
VISIT TO ZAGREB.  AFTER CROATIA\'S TOP NEWSWEEKLY PUBLISHED A 
LENGTHY INTERVIEW WITH DRASKOVIC CONTAINING SEVERAL 
STATEMENTS CONSIDERED BY MANY IN ZAGREB TO BE INFLAMMATORY, 
DRASKOVIC WAS \"DISINVITED\" BY PRESIDENT MESIC.  ZUZUL IS 
SCHEDULED TO TRAVEL TO BELGRADE TO MEET DRASKOVIC SHORTLY 
AFTER THE ADRIATIC PARTNERSHIP MEETING.  SIMUNOVIC, WHO IS IN 
CHARGE OF CROATIA\'S PR CAMPAIGN TO BUILD POPULAR SUPPORT FOR 
NATO, WOULD PROBABLY RATHER NOT HAVE THE ZUZUL-DRASKOVIC 
MEETING DISPLACE THE ADRIATIC CHARTER MINISTERIAL FROM THE

1.  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR THE 
OUTSTANDING SUPPORT PROVIDED DURING THE MAY 4 - 5 VISIT OF 
FOUR CROATIAN PARLIAMENTARIANS TO BRATISLAVA.  THIS TRIP MADE 
AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNDERSTANDING BY THESE 
LAWMAKERS OF HOW TO HELP MOVE CROATIA FORWARD TOWARD NATO 
    MEMBERSHIP.  I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE TIME AND COMMITMENT 
OF DCM SCOTT THAYER AS WELL AS THAT OF YOUR DEFENSE ATTACHE, 
YOUR POL COUNSELOR AND YOUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER.  I WOULD 
LIKE TO SINGLE OUT POLOFF KASSIE KOHLER, WHO PUT TOGETHER AN 
OUTSTANDING PROGRAM AND MADE INSIGHTFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
DISCUSSIONS. 
 
2.  WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE VISIT CAME DURING A BUSY PERIOD 
FOR YOUR EMBASSY, FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT THE TIMING COULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER.  CROATIA\'S TOP POLICY PRIORITIES ARE TO 
JOIN THE EU AND NATO, AND THE VISITING CROATIAN MPS WERE 
EAGER TO LEARN FROM SLOVAKIA\'S RECENT SUCCESS. 
 
3.  THE CROATIAN DELEGATION LEARNED THAT IN ORDER TO REACH 
ITS GOAL, SLOVAKIA HAD TO OVERCOME THE LEGACY OF THE MECIAR 
GOVERNMENT, WORK STEADILY ON REFORM ISSUES WITHIN NATO\'S MAP 
PROGRAM AND ENGAGE WITH NGOS AND OPINION LEADERS TO BUILD 
PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT FOR INTEGRATION.  PERHAPS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON LEARNED WAS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT 
IF IT FOLLOWS SLOVAKIA\'S LEAD, CROATIA CAN OVERCOME THE LATE 
START BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S 
OSTRACISM OF THE TUDJMAN REGIME. 
 
4.  IN EACH MEETING, THE CROATIAN MP\'S WERE GIVEN THE 
OVERWHELMING IMPRESSION THAT SLOVAKIA BACKS FURTHER EXPANSION 
OF THE EU AND NATO AND STANDS READY TO HELP CROATIA SUCCEED. 
AT THE MOD AND MFA, EXPERTS SHARED COPIES OF LEGISLATION, PR 
STRATEGY DOCUMENTS AND ADVICE ON HOW SLOVAKIA QUALIFIED FOR 
NATO MEMBERSHIP.  AT THE PARLIAMENT, MEMBERS OF THE FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL DEFENSE COMMITTEES DISCUSSED THE 
ACTIVIST ROLE THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS MUST PLAY TO HELP THEIR 
    NATION MOUNT A SUCCESSFUL BID FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU AND 
NATO.  THE SLOVAK MPS MADE A CLEAR COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT 
CROATIA\'S EFFORTS. 
 
5.  AGAIN, I\'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR MAKING 
THIS SUCH A SUCCESSFUL VISIT; IT WAS A CLEAR CONTRIBUTION TO 
OUR TOP MISSION GOALS.

SUBJECT: CROATIA:  ON THE ROAD TO EU MEMBERSHIP 
 
Classified By: DCM Patrick Moon for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Croatia is clearly headed toward being named a 
candidate for EU membership at the June 17-18 EU Summit. 
However, we expect that the EU leaders will postpone a 
decision on setting a date to begin accession negotiations 
for a range of reasons, not all related to Croatia.  Italy, 
Slovenia and the UK have Croatia-specific concerns (ICTY and 
maritime sovereignty issues) while other members are 
reportedly concerned about enlargement fatigue and linkages 
to Turkey\'s status.  End Summary. 
 
SAA Ratifications and the Avis 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) When the European Commission presented a positive 
avis on Croatia on April 20, Croatian political leaders from 
all parties congratulated themselves on successfully 
achieving a key goal on the path to EU membership.  The 
positive avis was in question up until only a few days 
earlier when ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte sent a 
glowing report to the EC citing Croatia,s full cooperation 
with the Tribunal.  As as result, the Netherlands has now 
sent forward its ratification, and the UK has started the 
process with every prospect, according the British DCM, of 
ratifying the document before the EU Council meets June 
17-18.  According to our contacts here, the UK has not 
changed its views on Gotovina and holds the GOC responsible 
for the indictee,s transfer to the ICTY. 
 
Pre-Accession Negotiations 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Our colleagues from EU embassies are telling us that 
although the EU Council will certainly endorse the positive 
avis and accept Croatia as a candidate for membership, it 
will be in no hurry to set a date to begin negotiations.  We 
are told to expect the Council, for various reasons, to put 
off a decision on setting a date to begin accession 
negotiations until at least the next summit in December and 
possibly until 2005.  While the UK would argue that 
negotiations should not begin before Gotovina is in The 
Hague, other members are focused on issues such as Turkey, 
maritime sovereignty in the Adriatic, and enlargement 
fatigue. 
 
4. (C) It now looks as though only Italy will not have 
ratified Croatia,s SAA by the time of the June Summit. 
According to the Italian DCM, Rome is reluctant because of 
lack of progress in resolving issues related to Croatia,s 
unilateral declaration last year of an exclusive ecological 
and fisheries zone in the Adriatic.  The Italian DCM and 
Slovenian Ambassador told us that Croatia has been inflexible 
and in no mood for compromise in three rounds of trilateral 
talks on the zone.  The Italian DCM said this was 
disappointing since it was clear that Croatia would 
eventually have to accept changes on use of the Adriatic as 
part of the EU accession process.  The Slovenian Ambassador 
criticized Croatia for its failure to engage on the basis of 
methods common among EU members for resolving disputes. 
 
5. (C) The Italian DCM specifically rejected any linkage 
between Rome,s ratification of the SAA (or related issues) 
and the still unresolved bilateral issues on property 
restitution to Italians who left Croatia at the end of WWII. 
 Despite several rounds of negotiations, Croatia still had 
not engaged seriously, and Rome was frustrated with Croatia\'s 
failure to address Italian concerns.  While the DCM asserted 
that this issue would be treated outside the EU accession 
process, most observers and the Croatian press believe Italy 
is indeed linking progress on the property restitution issue 
to Italian support in the EU. 
 
6. (C) Given the GOC,s near total focus on EU membership, we 
are surprised to learn that the MFA has kept the Italians and 
Slovenians at arms length on the maritime issues since either 
Italy or Slovenia could block further progress in Brussels. 
While the relative newness of the Sanader government may be 
to blame for the lack of progress on these issues, we also 
suspect that the HDZ,s nationalistic proclivities may be a 
more likely explanation for the lack of progress. 
 
7. (C) Unfortunately, lack of progress in Italy,s 
discussions with Croatia on the property restitution issues 
may be affecting efforts by the U.S., Austria and others to 
negotiate bilateral agreements with the GOC to provide the 
basis for former Croatians to seek restitution for property 
seized since WWII.  The GOC may be concerned that Italy might 
use any deal Croatia signs with another country against 
Zagreb to press for compromises on the more complicated and 
politically sensitive Italian claims. 
 
8. (C) The Political Counselor at the EC Mission underscored 
with us that the Commission,s green light represents just 
one small step in what promises to be a long drawn out 
process.  He dismissed any concern that a positive stance on 
the avis now would serve to reduce any leverage Brussels has 
over Croatia, particularly with respect to delivering 
Gotovina to The Hague.  In fact, the EC,s leverage &goes 
up,8 he said.  Brussels can apply the brakes anytime it 
deems appropriate.  It would be unfair, he added, to insist 
that all &outstanding issues8 with Croatia had to be 
resolved before offering a positive judgment on the avis. 
Croatia has been a success story in the region, and not to 
acknowledge this success would have been the wrong message 
for the other countries and not have served the reform 
process. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Sanader (and virtually all other political figures) 
will be very pleased with the June EU summit decision on 
Croatia,s candidacy as it definitively opens the door to 
membership and, importantly, to pre-accession funds from 
Brussels.  Possibly anticipating an EU decision to postpone a 
decision on beginning pre-accession negotiations, Sanader has 
been downplaying the importance of attaining membership as 
soon as possible (2007 is the target most often cited 
publicly).  This expectation-lowering approach is a prudent 
exercise for the savvy Sanader.  The accession process will 
be fraught with difficult political decisions for the GOC and 
unpopular changes to domestic policies.  As many of the other 
new EU members discovered during the accession process, you 
have to be careful what you wish for.

TRANSFER 
 
Classified By: Poloff Justin Friedman, reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY and COMMENT: On May 25, the ICTY announced the 
issuance of an indictment against Croatian retired General 
Mirko Norac for his role in the Medak Pocket case.  ICTY Head 
of Office Thomas Osorio (protect) told us that the Tribunal 
intends to transfer this case to Croatia for prosecution. 
Minister of Justice Vesna Skare-Ozbolt told Ambassador Frank 
that she was concerned about the timing of the indictment but 
that the GoC was ready to work through the legal issues to 
ensure the Croatian judicial system was ready to try the 
case.  Although this announcement compresses the time the GoC 
has to prepare for this first case transfer, we believe that 
the key players, including the Minister of Justice and the 
Chief State Prosecutor, will do everything necessary to 
ensure the Croatian legal system is ready to try this case. 
END SUMMARY and COMMENT 
 
Norac Indicted 
-------------- 
 
2. (C) The May 25 ICTY announcement of an indictment against 
Croatian retired General Mirko Norac came as a surprise. 
ICTY Head of Office Thomas Osorio told us on May 24 that he 
had expected that the judge would not issue the indictment 
for several weeks.  Osorio regretted the timing, as the ICTY 
on May 21 had just begun the first of a series of joint 
training seminars with the Ministry of Justice to prepare 
Croatian prosecutors and judges to handle indictments 
transferred to Croatia for prosecution under Article 11 bis 
of the ICTY Statute. 
 
Transfer to Croatia 
------------------- 
 
3. (C) Osorio said that the ICTY Office of the Prosector had 
been planning to join the Norac indictment to that of Rahem 
Ademi and make this case the first one transferred to 
Croatia.  However, as the weekend training seminar had 
verified, there were several legal issues outstanding that 
needed to be worked through.  The key issue is how to 
prosecute command responsibility charges absent a 
corresponding statute in the Croatian Criminal Code valid at 
the time of the crimes.  Osorio believes, as does OSCE Rule 
of Law Unit Head Mary Wycoff, that there are sufficient 
elements in Croatian law, including the Yugoslav National 
Army Military Law (valid in Croatia from 1992 to 1996), to 
cover command responsibility. 
 
Preparation Timing Compressed 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The problem for the GoC and the ICTY is building a 
sufficiently strong legal case around the command 
responsibility issue.  The weekend seminar confirmed that 
this issue remains controversial among Croatian legal 
professionals.  Osorio reported that Croatian judges, led by 
Supreme Court Justice Damir Kos, will insist on a 
Constitutional Court ruling in the matter.  Osorio had hoped 
to have much of the summer to build this case, but the early 
release of the Norac indictment will compress this timing. 
 
Bad Political Timing for GoC 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Minister of Justice Vesna Skare-Ozbolt told Ambassador 
Frank on May 25 that she was also concerned about the timing 
of the indictment.  The Sabor is scheduled to discuss the 
ICTY indictments of Cermak and Markac in the next day or two, 
and the GoC has been working hard to manage the tone of this 
debate.  The release of the Norac indictment would make it 
more difficult to keep inflammatory rhetoric out of the 
debate, even if the debate\'s conclusions have been worked out 
in advance. 
 
6. (C) Skare-Ozbolt said it would be important at the outset 
that it be made clear to the public that the Norac case would 
be transferred to Croatia for prosecution.  Osorio told us 
that there would be no arrest warrant or request for transfer 
for Norac.  However, the ICTY press release issued May 25 
makes no mention of these points. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) We believe that Minister Skare-Ozbolt, along with 
State Prosecutor Mladen Bajic, are committed to preparing the 
Croatian legal system as much as possible to ensure that 
cases transferred from ICTY are properly handled.  Aside from 
 
 
the legal issues to be resolved, the ICTY Statute 11 bis 
requires that the Tribunal monitor how these cases are 
handled, with the option of pulling the trial back to The 
Hague if the GoC cannot handle its responsibilities.  Osorio 
and Bajic have told us that they want to have a successful 
first prosecution and are taking steps to ensure a success. 
The compressed timetable will add to the challenge, but not 
make it insurmountable.

REELECTION PROSPECTS 
 
 
Classified By: Polecon Counselor Nicholas Hill, for reasons 1.5 (B) and

Summary 
-------- 
 
1.   (C) In what was mostly an inside baseball discussion 
about Croatian politics, President Mesic\'s top Domestic 
Policy Advisor, Igor Dekanic, told us on May 26 that he was 
optimistic about Mesic\'s reelection prospects -- although an 
official announcement of his candidacy was still months away. 
 Mesic had the likely support of all the key opposition 
parties and maybe even of the HDZ.  Dekanic praised the 
current government; PM Sanader was doing more to implement a 
reform agenda than the prior SDP-led government.   Mesic\'s 
agenda is the same as the current government\'s, including 
getting into NATO and the EU, and cooperating with the War 
Crimes Tribunal.  So long as Sanader could keep his party\'s 
nationalists at bay, the HDZ was on the right course and 
Mesic was comfortable working with the government.  That 
said, according to Dekanic, Sanader needed to show progress 
on his reform agenda to keep his rank and file happy.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.   (C) We spoke to Igor Dekanic, President Mesic\'s Domestic 
Policy Advisor, in his offices on May 26.  He was very 
satisfied with Mesic\'s position in the run up to presidential 
elections this coming winter.  He said that Mesic had 
carefully courted support across a range of political 
parties, including virtually all the members of the previous 
ruling coalition.  A number of parties, including the 
Croatian Peoples Party (HNS), the Liberal Party (LS), and 
Libra, have already stated publicly that they will support 
the President.  The Social Democrats, the leading opposition 
party, look likely to line up behind Mesic.  Owing in part to 
its own disarray, the Peasants Party (HSS) is also likely to 
back Mesic, although they may wait until the last moment 
before showing support.  Dekanic said even those parties 
contemplating fielding candidates to run against Mesic were 
not necessarily doing it with a view to winning.  Should HDZ 
run current Deputy Prime Minister Andrej Hebrang for 
president, representing the party\'s right-wing base, he would 
lose.  This may even help Sanader keep the party\'s 
nationalists in their box. 
 
Foreign Policy on Domestic Politics 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.   (C) We asked Dekanic how foreign policy -- particularly 
relations with Serbia-Montenegro -- was affecting domestic 
politics in Croatia at the moment.  He said the situation was 
stable.  SaM President Marovic had just come to Zagreb and 
had very productive meetings -- although both sides agreed 
not to get too much in the weeds on issues, given the 
political uncertainty in Belgrade at the moment.  We asked if 
Mesic\'s recent snub of SaM Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic 
reflected Mesic\'s playing domestic politics in an election 
year.  In short, yes, Dekanic answered.  Turning more 
serious, Dekanic described Draskovic as a metaphor for the 
whole political situation in Serbia right now.  Hard-line 
nationalism had made a comeback, and the emergence of 
Tomislav Nikolic -- whose Serbian Radical Party still claims 
sizable parts of Croatia as its own -- was troubling. 
Croatia, Dekanic said, will try to prevent a similar 
nationalist backlash.  \"We don\'t want to wake up the same 
sort of people here.\"  (He conceded that Draskovic\'s 
nationalism was not of the same virulence as Nikolic\'s.) 
 
4.   (C) According to Dekanic, keeping Croatia on the reform 
track -- toward NATO and the EU -- was essential.  \"We need 
progress to keep the nationalists at bay.\"  He said that 
President Mesic remains a staunch supporter of the War Crimes 
Tribunal.  PM Sanader was also doing everything he could to 
cooperate with the ICTY, in accordance with Croatia\'s 
obligations.  This would continue, although Dekanic conceded 
that the current government must oppose elements of recent 
indictments that call into question the legacy of former 
president Franjo Tudjman.  We stressed to Dekanic the 
importance of seeing indictee Ante Gotovina delivered to The 
Hague.  Dekanic agreed, adding, however, that if Gotovina 
remained an impediment to Croatia\'s reform process, the 
current HDZ government would have a difficult time keeping 
its nationalist elements in check.  Gotovina could \"tip the 
scales\" inside the HDZ, and then Sanader will have real 
problems. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.   (C) Politics in Croatia are fairly straight forward 
these days, and Mesic\'s prospects for reelection are looking 
about as good as they can at this stage in the election 
cycle.  His approval ratings are consistently in the 80s. 
Dekanic does describe a threat: reawakening Croatia\'s 
 
 
nationalists.  This is more a long-term problem for PM 
Sanader than for Croatia as a whole.  The Prime Minister\'s 
party, the HDZ, is best looked at like a bicycle.  So long as 
there is forward movement on Sanader\'s reform agenda, then 
the party\'s reformers should remain in charge.  When there is 
no more forward movement, then HDZ -- particularly its 
current leadership -- could have problems.

SUBJECT: NATO SECRETARY GENERAL VISITS CROATIA 
 
Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C) In a brief visit to Zagreb on May 26, NATO Secretary 
General (SYG) Jaap de Hoop Scheffer \"left a message of 
encouragement\" for Croatia to move forward toward qualifying 
for an invitation to join the Alliance by making concrete 
progress in NATO\'s Membership Action Plan.  In an outbrief to 
NATO Ambassadors, the SYG said he was impressed with the new 
government\'s commitment to continued reforms, but noted with 
concern that if President Mesic gets his way, Croatia will 
waste scarce defense resources in directions that do not 
support accession to NATO.  In meetings with the President, 
PM, Foreign and Defense Ministers as well as at the 
Parliament, the SYG urged full cooperation with the ICTY and 
greater efforts to apprehend fugitive Ante Gotovina.  The SYG 
discussed the security environment in the region with the PM 
and was pessimistic about prospects for finding a long-term 
solution in Kosovo.  End Summary. 
 
A Tour of MAP Countries Before Istanbul 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) On May 26, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop 
Scheffer visited Croatia and met with the President, Prime 
Minister, Foreign and Defense Ministers and the Speaker of 
the Parliament.  In a briefing to NATO Ambassadors accredited 
to Croatia, the SYG said the Zagreb visit was the first stop 
in a trip to all three of NATO\'s MAP countries.  After 
visiting Skopje and Tirana, the SYG said he will attend a 
meeting of the North Atlantic Council at SFOR headquarters in 
Sarajevo.  The SYG said he was considering adding a stop in 
Belgrade to the trip, but no plans have been made so far. 
 
Croatia Wants a Fast Track To Membership 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The SYG said that one of the main reasons he 
scheduled this pre-Summit trip to the three MAP countries was 
to \"leave a sign of encouragement\" as the Istanbul Summit 
approaches.  He was impressed with Croatia\'s declared 
commitment to continue the reforms needed to qualify for 
membership.  The SYG said that PM Sanader was optimistic 
about Croatia\'s chances to enter the Alliance.  Sanader said 
Croatia has its NATO bid on a \"parallel track\" with its EU 
application; he said that Croatia aspires to \"catch the EU 
train and arrive in the same car\" as Bulgaria and Romania. 
Sanader sought advice from the SYG on how to work with the 
other MAP countries; whether Croatia can expect to accede to 
membership on its own or if its fate is tied to Albania and 
Macedonia.  The SYG said that candidates will be assessed on 
an individual basis, but in the meeting with NATO Ambassadors 
pointed out that while NATO and the EU have always talked 
about individual assessments, when it comes to enlargement, 
\"they act in big bangs.\"  The SYG said that none of his 
interlocutors expected an invitation for Croatia at Istanbul. 
 
Cooperation On War Crimes 
------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The SYG discussed cooperation with ICTY in all of his 
meetings with officials in Zagreb, and made this point 
particularly clear during his address to the Croatian 
parliament.  In meetings with the PM and FM, the SYG was told 
that Croatia expects ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte\'s 
upcoming report to the UNSC to be consistent with the \"full 
cooperation\" assessment she gave to the European Commission 
which led to the EC\'s positive \"avis\" on Croatia\'s EU 
membership application.  The SYG characterized both the PM 
and FM as very optimistic about del Ponte\'s upcoming report. 
Croatia does, however, expect some criticism inasmuch as it 
is not yet fully ready to accept war crimes cases from ICTY 
for trial by Croatian courts.  Sanader told the SYG that he 
understands how important the label of \"full cooperation\" is 
to NATO; the SYG said he \"got the impression that he is 
sincere.\"  During the SYG\'s outbrief, the Ambassador stated 
plainly that the USG will not base its judgment solely on del 
Ponte\'s assessment of Croatia\'s cooperation; for us it 
essential that the GoC apprehend ICTY fugitive Gotovina and 
transfer him to ICTY custody.  The Ambassador said that the 
Croatian government is well aware that we consider Gotovina\'s 
fugitive status as an obstacle to Croatia\'s progress towards 
membership. 
 
President Pulling Croatia Off-Track on Defense Reform? 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5.  (C) The SYG said that he was struck by the difference in 
how the government and President view Croatia\'s priorities 
for defense reform.  He was briefed in meetings with the 
Defense and Foreign Ministers about the ongoing Strategic 
Defense Review and about discussions on force restructuring. 
He was pleased that the government is working to create a 
 
flexible, modern force with capabilities that NATO can use. 
In his meeting with President Mesic, however, the SYG heard 
about plans to spend scarce defense resources to refit 
Croatia\'s fighter force, which demonstrates either a 
disregard for or a lack of understanding of NATO\'s 
priorities.  The SYG said this internal conflict is common in 
transition countries, but Sanader and his cabinet will be 
challenged to bring the President\'s archaic vision of the 
armed forces around.  The structure of Croatia\'s government 
does not help, the SYG continued.  A simple question like 
\"who is the commander-in-chief\" prompts a long discussion. 
It is still not clear, the SYG said, whether PM Sanader or 
President Mesic will occupy the one chair allotted to Croatia 
at the EAPC meeting in Istanbul. 
 
Regional Relations -- Concern About Serbia, Kosovo 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6.  (C) The SYG discussed relations in the region with 
Sanader and FM Zuzul at some length.  He reported that 
Sanader was committed to improving relations with neighbors, 
but was concerned about developments in Serbia.  Sanader said 
that he had extended the policy of allowing citizens of SaM 
visa-free travel to Croatia and described ongoing high-level 
contacts with government officials in SaM and hoped that 
these trends would continue.  Sanader expressed concern about 
political developments in Belgrade, particularly about the 
strength of the Serb Radical Party, which he said has as part 
of its party doctrine a goal of re-annexing Croatian 
territory.  Should the Serb Radical Party candidate win in 
June 13 Presidential elections, it would complicate a wide 
range of issues, including in Kosovo and Republika Srpksa, 
Sanader told the SYG. 
 
7.  (C) The SYG told NATO Ambassadors he had no answers for 
Sanader on how the international community should proceed on 
Kosovo.  He spoke bluntly, in very pessimistic terms, to NATO 
Ambassadors about the situation in Kosovo, and said he is 
\"not confident\" in the current plan; \"it is difficult to talk 
about \'Standards before Status\' when there are no standards.\" 
 
 
Strong Words for Parliament 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) In addition to ICTY cooperation, the SYG used his 
speech to the Croatian parliament to press for continued 
efforts on refugee return, judicial reform and defense 
reform.  He pressed legislators to continue to approve the 
necessary budget support to modernize Croatia\'s defense 
forces.  He also highlighted that the two-thirds majority 
vote in parliament required before deploying troops abroad 
would restrict Croatia\'s ability to respond to a rapid NATO 
deployment. 
 
Public Support for NATO Falling 
------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) The SYG said he had discussed the drop in public 
support for NATO in several of his meetings with GoC 
officials.  The GoC recognized the challenge, but pointed out 
that the public has firmly associated NATO with U.S. policy 
and Iraq.  The Ambassador concurred that the Croatian public 
did not understand the broad goals of NATO and challenged his 
ambassadorial colleagues in Zagreb to be more active in 
explaining publicly the benefits of membership in the 
Alliance.  The German Ambassador said that two other factors 
added to the drop in public support.  The first is that the 
security environment in the region has changed; Croatians no 
longer feel an imminent military threat.  The second is less 
tangible; many Croatians are tired of being lectured to, he 
said.  We should make it plain in our public statements that 
the Alliance wants Croatia to succeed and that NATO will 
benefit from Croatia\'s membership.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte briefed the 
diplomatic community on June 4 on her day and a half visit to 
Zagreb.  Del Ponte said that although Croatia\'s cooperation 
with the tribunal was the best of any country, she had warned 
the GoC leadership that she could change her assessment at 
any time.  Del Ponte supports transferring ICTY indictments 
to Croatia for prosecution, beginning with the 
soon-to-be-joined Norac and Ademi cases.  The ICTY is looking 
to the OSCE to monitor the performance of Croatian courts. 
However, ICTY Diplomatic liaison Jean-Daniel Ruch separately 
warned Ambassador Frank that past, simplistic OCSE 
assessments of Croatia\'s local prosecution capabilities could 
bias ICTY President Theodor Meron against approving the 
transfer of cases.  The assembled ambassadors were wary of 
OSCE mission creep, suggesting that the ICTY and OSCE look to 
developing local capacities to monitor war crimes cases.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
CROATIA COOPERATING FULLY 
------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On June 4, ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte 
briefed the diplomatic community on the results of her day 
and a half visit to Zagreb.  Del Ponte reiterated her public 
statements that Croatia is fully cooperating with the ICTY, 
including the continuing search for fugitive Ante Gotovina. 
The GoC has engaged in direct communication with the ICTY and 
has responded promptly to requests for assistance.  Del Ponte 
said she had made it clear to both President Mesic and Prime 
Minister Sanader that she would withdraw her positive opinion 
if she felt the GoC was slacking off on cooperation, 
particularly regarding Gotovina. 
 
3. (C) Del Ponte said that she had complete confidence in 
Chief State Prosecutor Mladen Bajic, who is a \"brilliant\" 
prosecutor, in leading the search for Gotovina.  Del Ponte 
expects the GoC to find Gotovina and to work actively with 
other governments to find him if he is not in Croatia.  She 
said within the next few months she expected the GoC to 
either confirm Gotovina was in Croatia or in a specific other 
country.  Prior to del Ponte\'s briefing, ICTY Diplomatic 
liaison Jean-Daniel Ruch, told Ambassador Frank separately 
that President Mesic and Prime Minister Sanader has assured 
del Ponte in their meetings that there was absolutely no 
interest among Croatian authorities in protecting Gotovina. 
 
READY TO TRANSFER CASES 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) Chief Prosecutor del Ponte told the diplomatic 
community the ICTY was getting ready to transfer the Norac 
and Ademi cases, once they had been joined into a single 
case.  She welcomed the work of Justice Minister Vesna 
Skare-Ozbolt to prepare Croatian judges and prosecutors for 
this transfer.  The issue for the Tribunal was whether the 
new special war crimes courts were ready to process 
transferred cases.  Most of the assembled ambassadors, 
including those from Germany, Canada, The Netherlands, and 
Ireland, said that despite some concerns, they felt that 
Croatia was ready to take on a test case.  The only way to 
know for sure was to send a case for prosecution. 
 
5. (C) In their separate meeting, ICTY\'s Ruch told Ambassador 
Frank that the transfer of cases could heavily depend on the 
OSCE.  Ruch complained that the OSCE was the only 
organization with a credible capability to assess the 
performance of Croatian judiciary.  However, the OSCE\'s 
reports for 2002 and 2003 (draft) appeared to be sterile 
number crunching exercises, which focused on the performance 
of small courts processing locally generated indictments and 
did not reflect the capabilities of the four courts 
designated to take on ICTY cases.  He feared that ICTY 
President Theodor Meron would rely only on these reports and 
assess that the Croatian judiciary was not ready to take on 
ICTY cases.  Ruch asked the Ambassador to weigh in with the 
OSCE Mission to provide a richer, more dynamic assessment of 
the evolving capacities of the four war crimes courts that 
would facilitate the transfer of the first test case to 
Croatia. 
 
ROLE OF THE OSCE 
---------------- 
 
6. (C) Del Ponte welcomed the role of the OSCE in monitoring 
local war crimes cases.  She noted that the ICTY does not 
have the resources to monitor transferred cases, and would 
look to the OSCE to assist.  German Ambassador Gebhardt Weiss 
cautioned against expanding the OSCE\'s role in Croatia and 
 
urged that Croatian NGOs be helped to grow into this role. 
Irish Ambassador Barrie Robinson, speaking on behalf of the 
EU, said with 25 member countries, the EU would have an 
enhanced capability to perform a monitoring function. 
 
7. (C) OSCE Head of Mission Peter Semneby said that the OSCE 
was working with the Ministry of Justice to identify issues 
and potential solutions regarding fairness issues in local 
prosecutions.  That said, he noted that he had told Judge 
Meron that for individual cases, there was no reason not to 
believe that the Croatian judiciary can handle prosecutions. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) The ICTY is probably right that there is no realistic 
short-term alternative to the OSCE playing a key monitoring 
role.  However, if our objective in transferring ICTY cases 
back to Croatia is to help Croatia come to terms with its own 
checkered war legacy, Croatian civil society will have to 
play a larger role in monitoring Croatian government 
institutions.  Longer term, we would agree with the German 
view that the OSCE could play a useful role in developing the 
capacity of Croatian NGOs to take on the monitoring function.

SUBJECT: U.S. SANCTIONS NOT MAJOR OBSTACLE TO CROATIAN GAS 
EXPLORATION IN SYRIA, INA INTERESTED IN IRAQ 
 
Summary 
------------ 
 
1.  (SBU) On June 1 we visited INA, the majority state-owned 
oil and gas company, to inquire about its overseas activities 
in general, and its exploration activities in Syria in 
particular.  Zeljko Belosic, Member of the Board and 
executive director for Oil and Gas Exploration and Production 
noted the importance of the Syrian gas concession to INA and 
a certain degree of difficulty associated with U.S. 
sanctions.  Belosic also listed other deals afoot and noted 
that INA hoped to get back into Iraq, perhaps in cooperation 
with a Jordanian or U.S. company.  End Summary. 
 
Syria is INA\'s Biggest Find in 15-20 Years 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Belosic described INA (and its exploration 
subsidiary, CROSCO) projects throughout the world, including 
in Egypt, Namibia, Syria, Algeria, Tunisia, and preliminary 
efforts to get back into the Russian market.  The discussion 
quickly turned to INA\'s gas concession in Syria.  Belosic 
noted the importance of this concession to INA -- the company 
had sunk over $140 million into the project and had no choice 
but to continue.  It was their biggest find in the last 15-20 
years.  The project started in 1998, had three drilling rigs 
in operation, and INA would start another 5-7 rigs next year. 
 That day INA was bidding on another concession block. 
 
3.  (SBU) Almost all INA\'s equipment and technology was 
American -- it was the technology of choice, it was what was 
taught in Croatian universities; INA knew and trusted U.S. 
suppliers.  Most of the large equipment needed in Syria was 
in place or not yet procured.  Thus the sanctions were 
causing significant but not insurmountable problems.  For 
example, six months ago INA had signed a contract for 
chemicals with Halliburton.  The chemicals were on a truck en 
route from Dubai to Syria when the sanctions went into 
effect.  Halliburton turned the truck around and had it 
return to Dubai.  In such a case, Belosic said INA does not 
get its money back, but can only accept delivery in some 
other country.  While the monetary value of the chemicals 
whose contracts could not be fulfilled was not that 
significant -- some tens of thousands of dollars -- there 
were warehouses full of chemicals worth several millions of 
dollars that needed to be used with the new chemicals.  While 
replacement chemicals could and had to be located and 
procured, their reaction with already purchased stocks was 
unknown, and could even cause accidents if proper care was 
not taken. 
 
4.  (SBU) In another case, INA had been told by the U.S. 
company that sold them some equipment that they could not 
provide service for that equipment.  Additionally, all the 
exploration rigs were American.  In the middle of the night, 
if a $100,000 part broke down, INA would normally call up the 
American supplier, and a replacement part would be put on a 
plane the same day.  With sanctions, INA would have to look 
for a replacement, perhaps from a licensee or U.S. 
joint-venture partner, from Europe or the Far East.  Each day 
that a rig sat idle cost INA $20,000.  Nevertheless, INA had 
operated in Libya for ten years under sanctions.  It was able 
to operate by locating alternative suppliers, often paying 
three times the normal price. 
 
5.  (SBU) Belosic felt confident that INA would overcome any 
problems presented by sanctions.  In fact, he noted that if 
INA\'s U.S. \"neighbors\" in Syria, Occidental, Marathon and 
Devon, had difficulties taking advantage of their concessions 
or fulfilling their contracts, INA would be happy to make an 
offer for their rights.  Belosic also provided embassy 
officers maps of INAs concession blocks in Syria and Egypt, 
which we can supply upon request. 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
6.  (SBU) Belosic said that, contrary to some news reports, 
INA was not yet back in Iraq.  It wanted to return -- it had 
been the last foreign company to leave Iraq just before the 
Iran-Iraq war, he said -- but the security situation was too 
difficult.  INA had had discussions with some Jordanian oil 
officials recently, and a joint venture in Iraq was a 
possibility.  (Note: King Abdullah of Jordan made an official 
 
 
visit to Croatia last week.  End note.)  INA had also 
expressed interest in cooperating in Iraq to Halliburton 
European representatives, asking them to pass the message 
back to the relevant parties.  INA had also been prepared to 
attend an \"oil\" meeting that had been scheduled in Basra, but 
which was then delayed.

SUBJECT: POLITICS AND PORK OVERTAKE SCIENCE IN CROATIA\'S 
GMO POLICY 
 
REF: (A) ZAGREB 578 (B) 03 ZAGREB 2224 
 
Classified By: Econoff Joshua Harris for reasons 1.5(b,d). 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) After initial tests in February first raised the 
prospect of unlabeled GMOs in the Croatian food market 
(reftel A), the GoC has thoroughly politicized the GMO debate 
and shown an eagerness to cash in on populist anti-GMO 
sentiment to drum up support.   A move in GMO policy away 
from science could potentially limit markets for US soy and 
corn exports to Croatia.  The establishment of a previously 
mandated agency charged with coordinating food safety 
analysis in line with EU standards has been accelerated and 
politicized.  Even before the testing scandal broke, the 
HDZ-led coalition shifted lead responsibility for GMOs from 
the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Culture.  As 
responsibility for GMO policy within the GoC becomes 
increasingly diffuse and GoC officials responsible for food 
policy show an unnerving disinterest in scientific arguments, 
prospects for government involvement in countering anti-GMO 
propaganda are slim.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Fanning the flames 
------------------ 
 
2. (U) Following February\'s report that a now-discredited 
biotech lab in Osijek had identified 14 domestically 
available food samples that contained GMO components (reftel 
A), the possible presence of GMOs in Croatian food has 
featured prominently in the media and public statements by 
high-level government officials.  On the heels of the first 
tests, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water 
Management Petar Cobankovic tasked the Institute for Public 
Health (IPH) -- the only internationally certified lab 
capable of detecting GMO material in food products -- with 
following-up and identifying which specific products violate 
strict Croatian laws on licensing and labeling of GMOs.  The 
IPH reports that up to 700 products have been tested so far 
this year (compared with less than 40 last year). 
 
3. (U) Minister of Health and Deputy Prime Minister Andrije 
Hebrang drew wide criticism for ignoring calls to identify 
specific products with possible GMO components.  At an April 
30 press conference, Hebrang cited likely undeserved 
financial hardship to businesses and fears over job losses in 
refusing to divulge the product names.  Confirming that there 
was no health risk because all offending products had been 
\"destroyed,\" Hebrang,s refusal to name names prompted 
Croatian Television to accuse him of putting the concern of a 
few hundred food workers above 4.5 million Croatian citizens, 
and several food producers to independently issue statements 
that GMOs are not used in their products. 
 
4. (U) After weeks of media speculation and anticipation, 
Cobankovic used a May 13 press conference on changes to farm 
subsidy regulations to announce the final results: of 37 
products tested, 36 contained no GMOs above the 0.9% 
threshold and one borderline case merited further retesting. 
In stark contrast to the frenzy leading up to the 
announcement, Cobankovic,s exculpatory statement received 
scant media attention. 
 
The new food safety agency smells like pork 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The Ministry of Agriculture has recently politicized 
the establishment of a new food safety agency by relocating 
it outside the capital and apparently favoring patronage over 
expertise in choosing the agency\'s management.  The new 
agency will have lead responsibility for food analysis while 
the inspection competence will remain with the IPH.  Though 
mandated by law in 2003 and considered an essential step 
towards fulfilling EU consumer protection requirements by 
both pro-GMO scientists and anti-GMO NGOs alike, the manner 
of the agency\'s creation has sounded alarms that HDZ is using 
the agency more for pork than consumer protection. 
 
6. (C) While the setup of the agency has been in the works 
for months, in a surprise move in March the GoC decided to 
locate the agency in Osijek (270km east of Zagreb).  Bozic 
informed us that a managing board of scientists and food 
safety experts from Osijek would run the agency while State 
Secretary for Agriculture Dragan Kovacevic (from Osijek) 
 
SIPDIS 
 
 
would oversee it.  Though Bozic acknowledged the agency 
seemed to have recently taken a decidedly political turn, he 
assured us that we would be able to \"swallow\" the managing 
board\'s membership once it is made public. 
 
7. (C) At Bozic\'s suggestion, we met with Kovacevic on May 28 
to discuss the manner of the food safety agency\'s 
establishment.  Kovacevic took great pains to assure us the 
agency\'s managing board would consist exclusively of 
scientists and experts well-trained in food safety issues. 
EU consumer protection legislation rather than politicking 
would dictate the board\'s membership.  Nevertheless, whereas 
Kovacevic\'s predecessor was willing to privately acknowledge 
benefits to GMO technology even as he publically echoed the 
GoC\'s anti-GMO line, Kovacevic himself seems both 
professionally and personally inclined to oppose any GMO 
introduction into Croatia.  Kovacevic unambiguously informed 
us that no GMO crops would be planted in Croatian soil even 
as he stressed that Croatian agricultural policy was all but 
determined by the EU. 
 
8. (C) Kovacevic saw little role for the Ministry of 
Agriculture or the new food agency in public education on GMO 
safety.  When asked about any programs in the works to 
balance an aggressive NGO-led anti-GMO campaign, Kovacevic 
stated simply, \"We\'re not trying to promote GMOs but rather 
\'healthy foods.\'\" 
 
Making nature protection a cultural issue? \"Stupid!\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
9. (SBU) A shift in \"nature protection\" responsibility -- 
including both national parks and GMO crop regulation -- from 
the Ministry of Environmental Protection to the Ministry of 
Culture earlier this year has left the authority to regulate 
GMO introduction in Croatia in the hands of a disinterested 
ministry and clouded responsibility for GoC response to GMO 
concerns.  The 2003 Law on the Protection of Nature (Reftel 
B) originally tasked the Ministry of Environment (in 
consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture) with 
regulating the importation, transshipment, production, usage, 
or sale of GMO seeds and crops for introduction into nature 
in line with the Cartagena Protocol.  The HDZ-led government 
shifted this nature protection authority to the Ministry of 
Culture -- but provided no additional funding or staff to 
fulfill this broadened mandate. 
 
10. (C) During a May 19 meeting on bilateral cultural 
cooperation, the Ambassador raised the GMO issue with 
Minister of Culture Bozo Biskupic.  At the mention of GMOs, 
Biskupic threw up his hands and exclaimed, \"This is stupid!\" 
According to Biskupic, the Ministry of Culture has no 
interest in the GMO issue and stressed that no one in his 
Ministry knew anything about the topic.  Biskupic is actively 
seeking to push the nature protection portfolio to either the 
Ministry of Health or Ministry of Agriculture.  (NOTE: Based 
on his visceral reaction to the question, Minister Biskupic 
does not seem prepared to coordinate permits for GMO release 
as required by the 2003 law.  END NOTE.) 
 
11. (C) Moving responsibility for nature protection from 
Environment to Culture has prompted wide criticism from 
scientists, NGOs, and even the EU.  Krunoslav Capak and 
Marijan Katalenic of the food safety division at the 
Institute for Public Health criticized GoC efforts to divide 
a limited number of experts trained in food safety issues 
among different ministries but expressed optimism that EU 
pressure could prompt change.  NGOs simultaneously view the 
move as a step away from coordinated environmental protection 
and food policy and an assertion of Croatia,s right to 
organize its government however it chooses.  Irena Brnada, 
Director of the Regional Environmental Center office in 
Croatia, singled out Minister of Environment Marina 
Matunkovic-Dropulic as the likely instigator of the 
reorganization, citing her desire to focus on the 
construction portfolio instead of GMOs.  Jagoda Munic, 
director of the influential Green Action NGO, defended 
Matunkovic-Dropulic as a strong proponent of the anti-GMO 
movement. 
 
12. (C) Academics, NGOs, and even the Ministry of Environment 
itself all expect the GMO portfolio to eventually revert to 
either the Ministry of Environment or Ministry of 
Agriculture.  While the IPH suggested the move was imminent 
and a direct response to EU pressure, high-level officials in 
the Ministry of Environment claimed they had no more than 
 
 
\"rumors\" about restructuring and that the Ministry of Culture 
could retain lead authority on GMO crop issues for many 
months. 
 
Comment: All food politics is local 
----------------------------------- 
 
13. (C) Though follow-up tests have all but shown early fears 
of GMOs in Croatian food were overblown, the GoC has shown a 
willingness to use the GMO issue to pander to public worries. 
 Scientists active in food safety policy-making expressed 
dismay that by moving responsibility for GMO analysis and 
education away from the technical experts, the GoC has been 
ceding ground to a well-organized NGO-led, anti-GMO campaign. 
 
14. (SBU) Public opinion research on GMO attitudes and 
awareness has primarily been done by NGOs with a priori 
conceptions of the results.  GoC officials stress that they 
have no role in public education.  Srecko Jelenic, Director 
of the Croatian Association of Genetic Engineers, offered 
that the government has refused to fund public opinion 
research for fear of alienating an anti-GMO public. 
 
15. (C) Scientists, government officials, and NGOs all 
acknowledge that the GMO debate in Croatia is temporary. As 
Croatia moves closer to the EU and harmonizes food regulation 
with EU norms, hopes of making Croatia \"GMO-free\" (reftel A) 
should fade. Yet in the short-term, the GoC can channel GMO 
fears into political support by sidelining science and 
focusing on emotion.  As long as GMO authority rests with an 
uninterested ministry and multiple agencies with unclear 
mandates vie for control of GoC GMO policy, the government is 
poorly positioned to counter rampant anti-GMO propaganda from 
the media and NGOs.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) During her June 28-30 visit to Zagreb, EUR DAS 
Kathleen Stephens reviewed developments in our bilateral 
relationship.  Satisfaction with the NATO Istanbul Summit was 
an important theme.  Government interlocutors agreed that 
progress on refugee returns and the search for Gotovina must 
continue and intensify.  The GOC reaffirmed its recognition 
of the special obligations it has in the region.  DAS 
Stephens reinforced our continued expectation that the 
government move toward signing an Article 98 Agreement and 
provide increased support for the new government of Iraq. 
Government officials described how EU accession was helping 
spur economic reforms.  End Summary. 
 
NATO - GOT WHAT WAS WANTED AT ISTANBUL 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) President Mesic told DAS Stephens he was pleased that 
the Istanbul Summit had gone as expected.  Although the press 
had commented negatively about the length of his meeting with 
President Bush (one paper had it at 28 seconds), Mesic said 
he was satisfied.  FM Zuzul also expressed satisfaction in 
his meeting with DAS Stephens, noting the Summit Communique 
had given Croatia a mechanism for advancing its own 
candidacy, giving Croatia greater influence over the tempo of 
its approach.  He said now that Croatia had the chair of the 
Adriatic Charter (A3) for the next six months, the A3 would 
be priority number one.  Commenting on the wide political 
consensus in Croatia for pursuing NATO membership, Zuzul 
joked that now the opposition parties were criticizing the 
HDZ government for not advancing Croatia\'s candidacy fast 
enough. 
 
NO MOVEMENT ON ARTICLE 98 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) DAS Stephens strongly urged FM Zuzul to move forward 
on our long-stalled discussion of an Article 98 agreement, 
noting that the lack of an agreement constrains our ability 
to assist Croatia to make progress on its NATO Membership 
Action Plan.  Zuzul said the GoC cannot move on Article 98, 
as it would have serious consequences for Croatia\'s relations 
with the EU.  He said he had told both Secretary Powell and 
Secretary Rumsfeld that while Croatia understands the U.S. 
 
SIPDIS 
need for an agreement, there would have to be a softening of 
the EU\'s anti-Article 98 stance before Croatia could make a 
move.  Zuzul added that UK Minister for Enlargement Dennis 
McShane had told him that while London was not firmly with 
the EU position on Article 98, it was not prepared to protect 
Croatia in Brussels if it signed an agreement with the U.S. 
 
RECOGNIZING INTERIM IRAQ AUTHORITY 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) In her meetings with Mesic and Zuzul, DAS Stephens 
urged the GoC to join with other leading democracies in 
supporting the democratic transition in Iraq.  President 
Mesic agreed that it was necessary to send a message of 
tolerance, adding that the UN must play a role, which Croatia 
would support.  FM Zuzul responded that the GoC will try to 
do more in Iraq including putting together a civilian medical 
team together with Macedonia and Albania to provide care to 
Iraqi civilians.  Zuzul said that a statement welcoming the 
Transitional Authority would be issued that same day.  He 
said Croatia wanted to be more diplomatically active in Iraq, 
adding that the GoC would create an Ambassador-at-large 
position with responsibility for Iraq. 
 
MORE FOR AFGHANISTAN 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Zuzul said he believed that President Mesic would not 
oppose expanding GoC efforts in Afghanistan.  Zuzul said the 
GoC was working with Germany with an eye toward contributing 
to a provincial reconstruction team.  (Note: Croatian troops 
are in their third rotation in Afghanistan.  End Note.) 
 
ICTY COOPERATION 
---------------- 
 
6.  (C) DAS Stephens welcomed Croatia\'s improved cooperation 
with the ICTY but cautioned that the Gotovina issue would 
continue to be an obstacle to Croatia\'s integration into 
Euro-Atlantic institutions.  The Minister of Justice said 
that Carla del Ponte had given Croatia six months to find 
Gotovina.  State Prosecutor Bajic said he was pleased with 
 
 
the cooperation the police and intelligence services were 
providing in the search for Gotovina.  He noted that no one 
was saying that Gotovina was not in Croatia any more, and 
that his goal was to find Gotovina, regardless of where he 
might be. 
 
REGIONAL ISSUES 
--------------- 
 
7.  (C) DAS Stephens observed that many leaders in the region 
are now looking to Croatia as a positive model to emulate on 
a broad range of issues including ICTY cooperation.  She 
suggested that it was time for the GoC to start playing a 
more active role in South Central Europe.  Zuzul responded 
that for obvious reasons, the GoC had been reluctant to be 
seen as playing a too-aggressive role in the region.  The GoC 
was now prepared to do more.  The Belgrade-Split rail 
connection had recently reopened, and the SaM was now talking 
seriously about replacing military with police to patrol the 
Croatian border. 
 
8.  (C) Similarly, Zuzul said that Croatia had had a go-slow 
policy with Kosovo.  However, Croatia had historically good 
connections to Kosovo and many Croatian businesses were eager 
to exploit their ties with Kosovar firms.  Zuzul offered DAS 
Stephens to use his good offices to provide a back channel to 
the Kosovo leadership.  He said he was ready to make a 
similar offer to the EU and UN, but would proceed cautiously 
to avoid giving Belgrade the impression that Croatia favored 
the Kosovars.  DAS Stephens thanked Zuzul for the offer and 
urged that the GoC could best help by reinforcing our message 
about standards.  Our core standard was that Kosovo become a 
place where non-ethnic Albanians (e.g., Serbs) could live 
safely.  Only when that was in place could the status of 
Kosovo be taken up.  Zuzul agreed, as he was concerned that 
the status quo could not be sustained and should not be the 
objective of the international community. 
 
9.  (SBU) Mesic welcomed the Serbian election results and 
planned to attend President-elect Tadic\'s inauguration.  (In 
the end, only FM Zuzul attended the ceremony, both Mesic and 
Sanader\'s offices announcing that scheduling conflicts 
prevented their attendance.) 
 
IPR MOU 
------- 
 
10.  (SBU) Zuzul told DAS Stephens that the GOC is finally 
ready to completely clarify the IPR MOU implementation. 
(Note: there are two laws that need to be amended to bring 
the MOU into effect -- the Patent Law and the Drug Law.  The 
Minister of Science has promised to facilitate the amendments 
to the Patent Law, while the Minister of Health has called 
such amendments \"complicated.\"  End note.) 
 
EU ACCESSION IMPETUS FOR REFORM 
------------------------------- 
 
11.  (U) Martina Dalic, State Secretary of the Ministry of 
Finance, described reforms needed for EU accession as the 
number one priority.  They include tackling the external debt 
problem and the internal reforms needed for accession. 
 
12.  (SBU) The Ministry is combing the tax code to close 
loopholes and remove senseless exemptions.  The purpose of 
these changes is not so much to produce revenue as to help 
create a more transparent system, with which it would be 
easier to comply.  More emphasis would be put on collection. 
The Ministry had drafted a proposal to cut income and profit 
taxes.  Longer term, as spending is ratcheted down, the GOC 
wants to cut payroll taxes to improve competitiveness. 
Overall, the government needed to be downsized to \"provide a 
space for the private sector.\" 
 
13.  (SBU) When Ambassador Frank asked about the 
privatization process, Dalic noted that the privatized 
sectors of the economy were clearly the most successful. 
Privatization was necessary for the further development of 
the energy and tourism sectors.  Dalic also discussed the 
concept of Public-Private Partnerships, which she felt could 
be useful in bringing managerial skills from the private 
sector to struggling public companies when \"local problems\" 
prevented a traditional privatization. 
 
PRESS INTERVIEW 
--------------- 
 
14.  (U) DAS Stephens\' interview with Bruno Lopandic, foreign 
affairs correspondent of state-owned \"Vjesnik,\" ran July 2 
under the headline \"We expect Croatia\'s stronger engagement 
 
 
in Iraq.\"  Regarding Croatia\'s reluctance to sign an Article 
98 Agreement, Stephens recalled the position of the HDZ 
during the election campaign, and regretted that \"time had 
not been found yet (for the government) to implement this.\" 
 
15.  (U) The following day, \"Vjesnik\" ran a commentary by 
Lopandic in which he lamented, \"no matter how hard the 
authorities are trying to prove otherwise, there is no 
denying that relations between the two countries have 
deteriorated...Croatia still has not learned the importance 
of keeping its word.  The Racan government first said a 
secret \'maybe\' with regard to Iraq that was followed by a 
 
SIPDIS 
public \'no.\'  The HDZ, on the other hand, made all kinds of 
promises when it was in the opposition but once it was in the 
ruling party, called upon official Washington to be 
understanding because it could not fulfill U.S. 
expectations.\"  Other media also picked up on the theme that 
the USG has not let the HDZ off the hook on either Article 98 
or Iraq. 
 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
 
16.  (SBU) DAS Stephens\' visit was extremely successful in 
pressing home the message that the U.S. is a firm friend of 
Croatia, but that it expects Croatia to live up to its 
obligations, be they to fulfill promises on Article 98 or to 
bring Gotovina to justice.  The GOC also made clear that it 
is serious about completing Croatia\'s pro-NATO, pro-European 
orientation. 
 
DAS Stephens has not cleared this message.

REF: ZAGREB 1080 
 
1. Since assuming office in December 2003, the new 
government of Croatia (GoC) has, on several occasions, 
publicly repeated its commitment to rapid and 
transparent privatization by 2006 of virtually all of 
the approximately 1,100 companies in which the GoC holds 
equity.  This divestiture will contribute to meeting 
European Union accession criteria, help reduce 
outstanding state liabilities, and enhance the 
competitiveness of the Croatian economy. 
2. The GoC\'s strong commitment to privatization was 
reflected in its acceptance of the conditions of new 
agreements with the World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund in June 2004 that stipulated a timeline 
for divestiture of the GoC\'s portfolio by 2006. 
 
3. The government is the majority shareholder in 
approximately 100 of the 1,100 companies and is a 
minority shareholder in the rest. To jumpstart the 
privatization process in March, the GOC appointed a new 
board and management team to oversee the process and 
resumed the tendering of companies. Since then, with the 
assistance of USAID-funded advisors, 10 majority-owned 
companies have been tendered with two of the companies 
receiving multiple bids from qualified investors. 
Accelerated USAID assistance has been requested by the 
GoC to meet its goals of tendering 3 to 5 majority-owned 
enterprises and sell minority shares of approximately 40 
to 60 enterprises per month. 
 
4.  To best meet the GoC\'s privatization targets, new 
approaches are being explored to selling companies \"still 
within the boundaries of the current Privatization Law\" 
that will preserve a transparent and competitive process 
but also enable a more rapid closure of transactions. 
These include introduction of public auctions using the 
Zagreb Stock Exchange for majority-owned companies as 
well as establishment of Public Private Partnerships for 
a limited number of transactions (see REFTEL). 
 
5. By November 2004, the GoC hopes to sell its minority 
share packages in some 200 companies and its majority 
holdings in 15 companiesQincluding two large loss 
makers.  Given that most of the enterprises are 
financially distressed, near bankruptcy and politically 
sensitive, these are ambitious targets.

SUBJECT: CROATIA HALTS VAT EXEMPTIONS FOR MOST NGOS 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) A recent change to taxation law means Croatian NGOs 
will again be required to pay VAT on purchases financed with 
foreign donations. Though some NGOs have raised alarms over 
alleged unfairness and lack of transparency, GoC efforts to 
clean up its tax policy are welcome steps. Although the 
government was completely within its legal rights to suspend 
VAT exemptions, its failure to adequately explain the 
decision to the NGO community has put the GoC on the 
defensive. USG assistance programs remain VAT exempt. END 
SUMMARY 
 
LET\'S TAX LIKE IT\'S 1997 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U) The April 30 national gazette published a Ministry of 
Finance decree revoking VAT exemptions for NGO purchases 
financed with foreign donations. The original 1997 law on VAT 
provided for narrow tax exemptions to humanitarian 
organizations. The GoC expanded these exemptions in 2001 to 
include human rights, minority rights, women\'s rights, and 
democracy-building NGOs. 
 
3. (U) As of May 8, VAT has been levied on in-country 
purchases of goods and services by NGOs financed with foreign 
assistance. NGO purchases financed with local assistance will 
continue to be assessed VAT. VAT will not/not be assessed on 
the receipt of foreign assistance itself. All existing 
bilateral agreements on VAT exemption, such as those with the 
USG and the European Commission, will remain in force. 
 
NGOS CONDEMN GOVERNMENT DECISION BUT IGNORE OLIVE BRANCH 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
4. (U) Three of the largest NGOs in Croatia -- BaBe (women\'s 
issues), GONG (democracy-building, election monitoring), and 
Green Action (environment) -- immediately and publicly 
criticized what they call the decision\'s harmful impact of 
civil society development. Two NGOs allege that the GoC 
attempted to bribe them with preferential tax treatment in 
exchange for dropping the issue. 
 
5. (SBU) GONG alleges government intimidation in the form of 
a June 1 audit by state tax inspectors. While all NGOs we 
spoke with expressed outrage at so-called retaliation for NGO 
protest, the Tax Administration has assured us audits are 
aimed only at the enforcement of tax laws and prevention of 
abuse. 
 
6. (SBU) Moreover, the Ministry of Finance accepted an NGO 
proposal to form a working group consisting of 
representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Tax 
Administration, NGOs, donors, and unions to brain-storm how 
best to support civil society without VAT exemptions. Since 
May 27, the GoC has attempted to work with key NGOs to 
establish public benefit criteria -- in line with European 
Union guidance -- that would allow for VAT refunds from the 
state budget for qualifying organizations. 
 
IT\'S NOT ABOUT THE BUDGET 
------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) No one claimed the VAT change was aimed at filling 
state coffers. BaBe and GONG told us that in their dealings 
with MinFin, the Ministry had no idea how much revenue the 
change would generate. In a separate meeting, MinFin 
officials told us that they are scouring tax regulations to 
close loopholes -- as much for tax policy reasons as revenue 
generation. 
 
8. (SBU) The GoC contributed 17 million kuna ($2.9 million) 
from its 2003 state budget to civil society development. The 
recently-created Foundation for Civil Society Development 
will work with the GoC, local administrations, and NGOs on 
increasing transparency in how state money is distributed to 
civil society organizations. 
 
TAX AGENCY HAS \"NO INTEREST WAGING WAR WITH NGOS\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
9. (SBU) On June 30, Deputy Director of the Tax 
Administration Zlatko Fabijancic told us that charging NGOs 
VAT was in no way about increasing state revenues, but rather 
was about simplification of the tax code and eliminating a 
potential source of abuse. His agency hoped to insure that 
VAT exemptions are fully in accordance with the 1997 law on 
 
taxation. This measure would also combat tax evasion, as 
individuals have created or fabricated NGOs with the 
intention not just to evade VAT but also income tax. 
 
10. (SBU) Fabijancic explained that the Tax Administration 
feels that eliminating NGO VAT exemptions constitutes a 
much-needed correction to the 2001 change -- exemptions the 
Tax Administration long warned was out of step with EU norms. 
Correcting what he saw as a clear aberration from both 
Croatian and EU law is a necessary part of harmonization with 
EU tax law. 
 
11. (SBU) Fabijancic defended the GoC against NGO allegations 
of disinterest or ill-intent. He denied \"bribery\" 
allegations. Asked about allegations of intimidation, 
Fabinjancic declared, \"We have no interest in waging war with 
NGOs.\" 
 
12. (SBU) In a separate meeting, a high-level contact in the 
Ministry of European Integration told us she personally does 
not/not see VAT exemptions for NGOs as inconsistent with EU 
policies nor does she believe EU harmonization demands taxing 
NGOs. She expressed hope that the GoC would be able to 
continue financial support for civil society while closing 
this tax loophole. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (SBU) Eliminating VAT exemptions for NGOs makes sense for 
Croatia\'s fiscal policy -- it simplifies the tax code, it 
closes a loophole, it eliminates a likely source of abuse, 
and it may even generate a modest amount of revenue. Based on 
our reading of the EC directive on VAT and discussions with 
the OSCE mission in Croatia, the GoC has done nothing 
inconsistent either with EU legislation or with best 
practices in EU member states. It has, however, failed to 
effectively explain its position to the NGOs. 
 
14. (SBU) Moreover, the GoC has shown a clear willingness to 
compromise with NGOs, offering to institute VAT refunds for 
organizations that meet public benefit criteria. Despite good 
faith efforts by the GoC to support civil society without 
manipulating the tax code, NGOs have stubbornly refused to 
discuss anything other than more exemptions. We are confident 
the GoC will continue to work with the NGO community to find 
a way to support civil society without resorting to 
manipulation of the tax code. 
 
15. (SBU) Discontinuing the VAT exemption looks worse than it 
is. In the assessment of large, internationally-funded NGOs 
we spoke with, NGO operations will continue despite a decline 
in purchasing power. In fact, the effectiveness of NGO 
pressure in generating MinFin\'s refund proposal is evidence 
that Croatian NGOs are alive, well, and not shying away from 
a fight. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: UNLICENSED GMO CORN RETURNS BIOTECH TO HEADLINES 
 
REF: ZAGREB 1037 
 
1. (U) On July 9, Minister of Agriculture Petar Cobankovic 
announced that a hybrid corn seed imported by US-based 
Pioneer Seeds tested positive for GMO content. Cobankovic 
estimates that 2,000 hectares of farmland have been planted 
with the GMO-contaminated seed. Destruction of contaminated 
cropland began on July 16 in Eastern Slavonia. 
 
2. (U) Pioneer currently holds about 35 percent of the 
Croatian market for corn seed. For unauthorized release of a 
GMO seed into Croatian soil, Pioneer will likely be liable up 
to 2 million kuna ($337,000). Beyond the immediate financial 
penalties, the damage to Pioneer\'s reputation on the local 
market is likely to be considerable. 
 
3. (U) In line with Croatia\'s Law on Nature Protection, 
unlicensed release into nature of genetically-modified seeds 
carries harsh financial penalties for the offending company 
and compels the GoC to compensate farmers for any damages. 
The Law further mandates that the GoC pull all contaminated 
seeds off the local market and clean up contaminated 
cropland. Though the Law establishes a procedure for 
licensing GMO release into Croatian soil, the GoC has 
established no regulations governing the issuance of licenses 
nor has the government shown any interest in implementing a 
GMO licensing procedure. 
 
4. (U) Until the licensing provisions of the Law are 
implemented, there is an effective zero tolerance policy on 
GMOs in seeds. Though the Institute for Public Health 
specified for us that the Pioneer sample seed contained 6 
parts per thousand GMO components, the local Pioneer 
representative released a statement noting that according to 
a certificate provided by Pioneer Labs in Iowa, this 
particular corn seed contained only conventional (non-GMO) 
components. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) Cobankovic\'s announcement promises to bring GMO 
anxieties back to the media\'s attention just as lingering 
fears of public health dangers associated with unlabeled GMO 
foods had started to fade. As science has increasingly been 
marginalized in the local GMO debate (reftel), this latest 
announcement only confirms Croatians\' worst fears -- that 
GMOs have been planted in their country without their 
knowledge. 
 
6. (SBU) Post is in the middle of a concerted public 
diplomacy effort to try to counter the widespread 
misunderstanding of biotechnology in Croatia. Three 
biotechnology experts influential in local food and 
environmental policy formulation will shortly arrive in the 
US on a biotech-themed International Visitors\' Program. We 
will soon roll out a revamped embassy website including 
numerous biotech links and an article in Croatian on this 
issue funded under Post\'s Democracy Commission small grants 
program. We should also take advantage of the proposed visit 
by OES A/S Turner this fall to reinforce our outreach efforts 
to scientists, policy-makers, and the Croatian public. END

SUBJECT: CROATIA TAKES SMALL STEP TOWARDS INCREASED MEDIA 
FREEDOM 
 
Classified By: PolOff Justin Friedman, reasons 1.5 (b and d) 
 
1. (U) In a marathon session on July 15, Croatia\'s Parliament 
approved amendments to the Penal Code concerning media 
slander.  The burden of proving the intent to slander and the 
actual offense now falls on the prosecution, not the 
defendant, and responsibility can no longer be transferred 
from a reporter to an editor.  This is an important step in 
the direction of increased media freedom.  However, in line 
with seldom-used provisions in other European countries, the 
possibility of a prison sentence for libel still exists. 
 
2. (U) Two recent cases of prison sentences given to 
journalists have stirred public debate.  One involves a 
&Slobodan Dalmacija8 journalist, Ljubica Letinic, who was 
sentenced to prison for libel in Split on July 12.  The other 
case involves the former editor-in-chief of the Slavonski 
Brod-based newspaper &Novi Brodski list8, Miroslav Juric. 
Juric was sentenced to prison after refusing to pay a fine 
for alleging the corruption of two judicial officials.  In an 
unusual twist, Minister of Justice Vesna Skare-Ozbolt 
personally paid Juric,s fine to keep him out of prison, 
saying, &In this country journalists will not go to prison 
for libel8. 
 
3. (SBU) The Ministry of Justice provided us with a 
background paper stating that because of shifts in the burden 
of proof and elimination of editorial responsibility, this 
change in the law effectively decriminalizes media slander. 
Minister of Justic Vesna Skare-Ozbolt has repeated this 
assertion of \"decriminalization\" in public. 
 
4. (SBU) Legal experts, including Sabor Member Ivo Josipovic 
and Croatian Judges Association Head Vladimir Gredelj, have 
criticized Skare-Ozbolt on two fronts.  They claim, first, 
that the Minister paying the fine does not solve the problem 
but only reduces respect for the rule of law.  Second, they 
say that the approved legal changes in fact do not fully 
&decriminalize8 libel despite Skare-Ozbolt,s assertions. 
They have a point.  Because the legal burden now shifts from 
the journalists to the prosecution, it will be more difficult 
to prove libel.  However, media slander does in fact remain 
part of the Criminal Code and can therefore be punishable by 
incarceration. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) The popular Skare-Ozbolt is usually a very sure-footed 
politician.  What in the U.S., for example, might have played 
as a great public relations ploy, appears to have backfired 
on her here.  In paying Juric,s fine, Skare-Ozbolt may have 
been trying to harmonize Juric\'s punishment with intent of 
the new law.  In doing so, she has made her first public 
relations misstep since taking office.  Skare-Ozbolt has told 
us that she is ready to use the media to advance her reform 
agenda.  Oddly, the media has not jumped to defend and 
support her but has actually been used by opponents to attack 
her actions.  She may have inadvertently misstepped here, but 
we fully expect her to regain her footing.

1. (U) This is an action message. Please see paragraph 5. 
 
2. (C) On June 15 we met with Drazen Hrastic, Head of Office 
for Cooperative Security, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
advance of the Dayton Article IV Review Conference (REF C). 
The essence of this conversation was passed to Department REF 
D.  Hrastic indicated that while Art. IV implementation on 
measures for sub-regional arms control is ongoing, there is a 
high level of implementation within the region and excellent 
cooperation among the parties.  Hrastic believes it is not 
too soon to start thinking about a time when Art. IV will be 
closed and its provisions subsumed to the CFE Treaty. 
 
2. (C) FUTURE OF REGIONAL ARMS CONTROL: In this context, 
Hrastic sought clarification of the U.S. approach to regional 
arms control.  Specifically, under what framework would 
ongoing arms control and verification procedures be 
conducted?  Hrastic said the GoC would prefer that Art. II 
elements be transferred to IV or possibly Art. V.  However, 
Hrastic said that some countries (unspecified) seemed to 
support further confidence building and verification measures 
be conducted in the OSCE framework.  Hrastic emphasized that 
Croatia would not block consensus, but he was simply seeking 
U.S. views.  The GoC wants to see consensus on three issues 
related to Art. V: 1) its purpose; 2) its content; and 3) 
general agreement between the OSCE and the parties. 
 
3. FUTURE of RACVIAC: Expressing his personal opinion, in the 
context of the U.S. leaving RACVIAC (Refs A and B), Hrastic 
is concerned that the U.S. is backing out of the arms control 
business in the Balkans.  Hrastic complained that not all 
RACVIAC members were proactive in determining what that 
organization should be doing, particularly regarding training 
activities.  In that regard, Hrastic said that there appear 
to be communication problems between the OSCE\'s Personal 
Representative (designated under the Dayton Agreement) and 
RACVIAC.  The Office of the Personal Representative was not 
providing sufficient feedback on training requests.  Hrastic

considering taking this position but we indicated that we 
were unsure how strong a role the U.S. could take in 
addressing organizational issues if we were to take on 
observer status. 
 
4. FUTURE TRAINING: Hrastic said that in his recent 
Washington consultations, he had asked about possible U.S. 
education and training for Dayton parties.  He said that 
there had been some initial discussion of training for 
military NCOs and of training in disaster relief programs. 
He asked what were the U.S. plans in this regard. 
 
5. ACTION REQUEST: Post requests Department instructions for 
answering Hrastic\'s specific questions on the future of the 
Dayton annex and our role in RAVIAC.

SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST 
-------------------------- 
 
1. (C) The GoC solidly supports the Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI).  In two recent meetings, key foreign 
ministry interlocuteurs have requested US views on modalities 
for intelligence sharing under PSI as well as US advice in 
organizing the GoC\'s own National PSI Coordinator Office. 
The GoC has also offered to participate or even host 
PSI-related military exercises either under the umbrella of 
the Adriatic Charter or as a broader regional exercise.  The 
GoC has also expressed interest in exploring bilateral 
boarding and non-overflight clearance agreements with the US. 
 Post requests Department guidance in responding to these 
offers for an expanded role for Croatia in the PSI. END 
SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. 
 
HIGH-LEVEL SUPPORT SQUARELY BEHIND PSI 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) On July 22, Assistant Minister for Multilateral 
Affairs in the MFA Tomislav Vidosevic called acting PolEcon 
Chief to his office as a follow-on to reftels to express 
personally the GoC\'s eagerness to participate in PSI. 
Vidosevic affirmed that strengthening Croatia\'s involvement 
in PSI is a central task of this government as part of its 
objective to play a constructive role in the region. 
Vidosevic stressed that Croatia sees PSI as a clear step 
towards Euro-Atlantic integration, even as Croatia seeks to 
maintain its position within SE Europe. 
 
3. (C) Vidosevic said that the GoC is working to organize 
itself better to participate more fully in PSI, through 
improving horizontal communication among MFA, MinDef, MinFin, 
MinInt, and intelligence services.  He said he had invited 
senior Polish officials -- including the Polish National 
Coordinator for PSI -- to come to Zagreb in September for a 
\"trilateral exchange of views\" with US representation.  In 
response to our question on what type of US participation he 
envisioned, Vidosevic backed off, saying that he wanted to 
postpone a visit from Washington until more concrete 
preparations had been completed. 
 
4. (SBU) In response to our observation that PSI could meld 
well with Croatia\'s involvement in the Adriatic Charter 
regarding maritime issues and interdiction, Vidosevic 
suggested joint training exercises in the region could work 
within the A-3 framework.  He added that while the GoC was 
very keen to see the US included, he realized the initiative 
would have to come from the A-3 themselves. 
 
CROATIA TAKES STOCK OF PSI PROGRESS TO DATE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Prior to the Vidosevic meeting, on July 7 we took 
stock with Drazen Hrastic, Head of Department for Cooperative 
Security and GoC POC for PSI, of Croatia\'s progress to date 
on the five objectives outlined by U/S Bolton in Lisbon in 
April. 
 
6. (SBU) SUPPORT: Croatia has already issued a statement of 
support and remains enthusiastic for GoC participation in PSI. 
 
7. (C) LEGISLATION: Hrastic believes the legislative review 
could be conducted in parallel with Croatia\'s acquis 
implementation program in which police interdiction 
competencies could be extended in line with PSI guidelines. 
The MFA recently produced an internal policy document 
recommending both the establishment of an inter-ministerial 
body with authority over not just legislative review but 
day-to-day operations and closer cooperation with other PSI 
countries.  In terms of intelligence sharing, Hrastic asked 
how we would like to see intelligence resources reallocated 
within PSI. 
 
8. (SBU) CONTACT: Drazen Hrastic will be the working level 
PSI contact at least until an inter-agency coordination body 
is up and running.  The appropriate rank of a full-time PSI 
coordinator will be determined in collaboration with Poland 
and the U.S. 
 
9. (C) AGREEMENTS: GoC is prepared to consider both a 
boarding agreement and an overflight denial agreement and 
asked if we could produce any sample agreements previously 
concluded with other countries.  At the Vidosevic meeting, we 
responded that the US will likely focus efforts on concluding 
agreements with the most problematic flag-of-convenience 
countries as a first priority and that an agreement with 
Croatia would likely be considered in subsequent rounds of 
 
such negotiations.  Hrastic noted that Croatia could be of 
more assistance interdicting foreign-flagged vessels in 
Croatian territorial waters rather than Croatian-flagged 
vessels in international waters. 
 
10. (C) TRAINING: Croatia is willing to host an indiction 
training exercise both to further PSI participation but also 
to fulfill Croatia\'s MAP obligations.  Hrastic noted that 
Croatia will certainly observe any training exercises in the 
region but would like to participate if its capacity permits. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. (C) Croatian participation in PSI clearly has solid 
high-level political support -- as Assistant Minister 
Vidosevic\'s meeting request demonstrates.  Yet dispite broad 
promises to press ahead with training exercises and 
interdiction agreements, Croatia may find its enthusiasm 
outstrips its resources.  As Hrastic himself summed it up: 
\"It\'s not a question of willingness but capacity.\"  Within 
our larger priorities, we should tap this enthusiasm by 
seriously considering supporting any follow-up ideas 
presented by the GoC for hosting PSI-related exercises.  END

SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1.  Overturning a 2002 acquittal, the Croatian Supreme Court 
has called for a retrial of eight Croatian military police 
accused of the torture and murder of ethnic Serb civilians 
and soldiers at Lora Prison.  The international community 
praised the ruling as Croatian recognition of the original 
trial,s judicial bias. 
 
2.  Reversal of the high profile Lora acquittal demonstrates 
Croatia,s readiness to address the judicial shortcomings 
apparent in lower courts during earlier domestic war crimes 
trials -- a critical task before the GOC accepts the transfer 
of cases from the ICTY.  The Lora case also highlights the 
need for development of witness protection measures within 
Croatian courts, as much of the testimony rejected during the 
trial was in the form of depositions taken in Serbia from 
former Lora inmates who refused to appear in court due to 
death threats.  Post has placed a high priority on witness 
protection in its project to strengthen the Croatian 
judiciary,s war crimes trial capacity.  END SUMMARY and 
COMMENT. 
 
REACTION TO RETRIAL, READY FOR REFORM 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  The Croatian Supreme Court on August 19 overturned the 
November 2002 acquittal of eight Croatian military police 
accused of torturing and murdering ethnic Serb prisoners in 
Lora Prison near Split in 1992.  The county court had 
acquitted the eight guards after a six-month trial that was 
universally criticized within the international community as 
a gross miscarriage of justice.  According to the Supreme 
Court ruling, presiding judge Slavko Lozina incompletely 
established facts and failed to admit crucial evidence, 
including testimony from former inmates.  The ruling returned 
the case to the county court for retrial before a new panel 
of judges. 
 
4.  Reacting to the Supreme Court,s announcement, Lozina 
claimed the justices quashed his verdict due to criticism 
from Minister of Justice Vesna Skare Ozbolt, who Lozina 
claims is kowtowing to the OSCE and State Department. 
Meanwhile, OSCE Ambassador Peter Semneby told the press the 
decision recognizes international concerns voiced during the 
original trial and indicates the need to improve the capacity 
of the Croatian judiciary.

REF: STATE 163453 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. This cable responds to reftel questions on Croatia\'s 
efforts to prevent the worst forms of child labor. 
 
2. Croatia has taken solid steps to counter the worst forms 
of child labor, enacting legislation proscribing the problem 
and ensuring the implementation and enforcement of existing 
legislation. Recent changes to the criminal code have 
criminalized trafficking in children for purposes of sexual 
exploitation and labor. A national Ombudsman for Children 
coordinates GoC efforts to prevent the exploitation of 
children and to assist in removing children from exploitative 
situations. We find plans to introduce trafficking awareness 
education an encouraging and necessary step towards 
preventing child trafficking from or through Croatian 
territory. END SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
 
LEGISLATION 
----------- 
 
3. Does Croatia have adequate laws and regulations 
proscribing the worst forms of child labor? 
 
The Croatian Parliament adopted ILO Convention 182 on the 
worst forms of child labor on July 17, 2001. The Convention 
entered into force on July 17, 2002. 
 
While Croatia has no single law on child labor, a number of 
labor and social protection laws have been promulgated. The 
Labor Law establishes a minimum age for legal employment of 
15. Children between the ages of 15 and 18 may work only with 
written permission from a legal guardian. An Occupational 
Safety Act prohibits children under the age of 18 from 
working overtime, at night, or in dangerous work conditions 
or with dangerous substances. The Family Act establishes 
social protection procedures to assist exploited or 
vulnerable children while a criminal investigation against 
their abuser is pending. The Law on the Ombudsman for 
Children establishes a state office to promote and protect 
the interests of children throughout the country. The Defense 
Act prohibits children under 18 from serving in the armed 
forces. The Elementary Education Act mandates eight years of 
primary education for all school children (ages 7-15). The 
minimum working age of 15 is consistent with these education 
requirements. 
 
Croatia currently has no law expressly defining the term \"the 
worst forms of child labor,\" though the Croatian criminal 
code effectively fulfills this requirement. The code 
specifically mentions kidnapping, use of children in 
narcotics trafficking, slavery, international prostitution, 
procurement of children for sexual abuse, use of children in 
pornographic production, and abuse or neglect related to 
labor. Changes to the criminal code in May 2004 add a Cyber 
Convention, criminalizing the act of allowing children access 
to pornographic material on computer networks. The 
Occupational Safety Act limits workers between 15 and 18 from 
working in dangerous or harmful work conditions or with 
chemical or radioactive materials. 
 
4. Does Croatia have adequate laws and regulations for the 
implementation and enforcement of proscriptions against the 
worst forms of child labor? Have there been any recent 
governmental or judicial initiatives to strengthen or enforce 
child labor legislation and regulation? 
 
Six state bodies share authority for implementing and 
enforcing child labor laws in Croatia. 
 
(a) The Ministry of Justice is responsible for maintaining 
the criminal code and bringing criminal charges defined by 
the legislation above. (In 2003, the Ministry of Justice 
recorded 0 criminal charges for international prostitution, 6 
for procurement or pimping of children, 37 for exploitation 
of children for use in pornography, and 19 for allowing 
children access to pornography.) 
 
(b) The Ministry of the Family, Veterans, and 
Intergenerational Solidarity oversees Centers for Social Work 
and coordinates social services available to a child while a 
criminal investigation into abuse is pending. 
 
(c) The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare assists the 
Ministry of the Family and Center for Social Work in 
providing protective services (including protective custody 
arrangements) during an abuse investigation. 
 
(d) The Ministry of Economy, Labor, and Entrepreneurship is 
responsible for investigating abuses of Croatian labor laws 
and monitoring work environment safety. 
 
(e) The State Inspectorate is responsible for tracking legal 
violations of employment statutes independently of criminal 
proceedings. 
 
(f) The Ombudsman for Children is responsible for 
coordinating GoC efforts to protect and promote the rights of 
children. The Ombudsman receives and responds to abuse 
allegations from both victims and the general public. While 
the Ombudsman has no legal authority to impose penalties, the 
Ombudsman works closely with police and the district 
attorney\'s office to follow-up on abuse allegations. 
 
In July 2004, the Croatian Parliament passed changes to the 
criminal code introducing Trafficking in Persons as a 
separate criminal act. The law, set to enter into force on 
October 1, 2004, contains wording specifically related to 
children and foresees a minimum prison sentence of five years 
for violations. Under the new code, \"whoever, in violation of 
the rules of international law, buys, sells, hands over to 
another person or mediates in the purchase, sale or handing 
over of a child or a minor for the purposes of slavery or a 
similar relationship, sexual abuse, prostitution, illicit 
transplantation of organs, exploitation of labor by minors, 
or for other illicit purposes shall be punished by 
imprisonment for not less than five years.\" 
 
From 2002-3, the Ministry of Justice catalogued 117 cases 
involving labor by children under 15. The children, 65% 
female, were employed in the hospitality, retail, industrial, 
and construction sectors. During the same period, the 
Ministry catalogued 5 cases of illegal dangerous work 
performed by children between 15 and 18 years old. Four cases 
involved children working at night in a bakery while the 
fifth involved a child working in forestry involving 
dangerous work conditions. 
 
The June 2003 Law on the Ombudsman for Children established a 
national office responsible for coordinating, promoting, and 
protecting the rights of children in line with legal demands 
found in the Croatian Constitution, the UN Convention of 
Rights of the Child, and other international obligations. 
Conceived to ensure that children have access to effective 
protection mechanisms in case of a violation of their rights, 
the independent Ombudsman\'s office coordinates and responds 
to all children\'s rights violations -- including child labor 
complaints under ILO Convention 182. 
 
The Ombudsman\'s office has legal competence to monitor the 
coordination of all laws concerned with the protection and 
interests of children, Croatian compliance with international 
obligations concerning children\'s rights, and implementation 
of all protective mechanisms. Moreover, the office tracks 
violations and informs the public about children\'s rights 
violations. The law compels state, regional, and local 
governments to cooperate with the Ombudsman\'s office and 
respond to any warnings, proposals, or recommendations within 
15 days. 
 
INVESTIGATIONS OF CHILD LABOR COMPLAINTS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
The Ombudsman has authority to enter premises for the purpose 
of evaluating care of children in temporary or foster care. 
Upon discovery of abuse, sexual mistreatment, or 
exploitation, the Ombudsman reports the incident to the 
General Attorney Office for investigation and prosecution. 
 
Ombudsman for Children Ljubica Matijevic-Vrsaljko informed us 
that since the office began functioning 9 months ago, it has 
received two complaints. In response to a letter alleging 
that clothing company United Colors of Benetton d.o.o. had 
produced an advertisement featuring a 14-year old girl, the 
Deputy Ombudsman traveled to the site of the advertisement, 
photographed the billboard for documentation purposes, and 
formally requested the company provide information about the 
girl featured in the ad. (The Ombudsman has broad powers to 
compel companies to comply with requests for information.) 
Benetton responded that the ad was not produced within 
Croatia but imported from Italy. The Ombudsman submitted a 
request for information to Benetton headquarters in Milan in 
July and is currently awaiting a reply. Should the Ombudsman 
receive confirmation that the child is under-age, the law 
compels the Ombudsman to inform the police and district 
attorney for a full investigation. (According to Ms. 
Matijevic-Vrsaljko, her role is \"not judge but truth-teller.\") 
 
The second case involves a 17-year old boy who claims a man 
stopped him on the street in Zagreb, complimented his 
appearance, and offered him substantial sums of money to 
appear in films. The Ombudsman has referred this case to the 
Zagreb police, who have since interviewed the boy and are 
currently investigating. 
 
With regard to funding, the Office of the Ombudsman for 
Children employs a full-time Ombudsman and two deputies all 
appointed to eight-year renewable terms. The Ombudsman has an 
annual operating budget of 3 million kuna ($500,000) and 
plans to hire 12 support staff this fall. According to State 
Secretary for Labor Vera Babic, the State Inspectorate has 
 
SIPDIS 
responsibility for inspecting worksites and enforcing labor 
protection legislation. The Inspectorate employs 84 
inspectors for investigating labor relations issues and 90 
for investigators labor safety and protection issues. Though 
these inspectors are not specifically tasked with child labor 
investigations, they help to establish national priorities 
for worker protection. The Ministry of Economy, Labor, and 
Entrepreneurship was unable to provide data on specific child 
labor inspections. 
 
The Ministry of the Interior provides training to government 
officials on legislation criminalizing various forms of child 
abuse -- including child trafficking, sexual abuse, and labor 
exploitation. The police academy offers a seminar for new 
recruits addressing domestic violence involving children, 
educating police officers about the possibility of child 
abuse within a family and instructing them on how to respond 
to domestic violence calls. 
 
SOCIAL PROTECTION AND EDUCATION 
------------------------------- 
 
5. Have social programs been implemented to prevent the 
engagement of children in the worst forms of child labor and 
to assist in removing children engaged in the worst forms of 
child labor? 
 
In line with its involvement in the UN Convention of the 
Rights of the Child and European trends towards establishing 
an Ombudsman for Children, Croatia established an Ombudsman 
for Children in 2003. The Ombudsman and two deputies have 
authority to advocate on behalf of children involved in 
exploitative employment situations and on behalf of children 
victims of trafficking independent of any political office or 
party. The 2003 law empowers the Ombudsman office to propose 
legislation to the national, county, and municipal 
governments to strengthen victim assistance on behalf of 
children. 
 
The Ombudsman expressed grave concern about newspaper ads 
that seek to recruit teenage girls for escort services or 
modeling agencies, noting that Croatian girls were uneducated 
about this \"open invitation to trafficking.\" The Ombudsman is 
working with the Ministry of Science and Education to 
introduce mandatory education and awareness-raising about the 
possibility of child trafficking -- she expects all Croatian 
school children will be required to watch the educational 
film \"Lilya Forever\" (about a child trafficking victim). 
 
Recognizing that criminal investigations often overlook the 
needs of the child, a Center for Social Welfare (CSW) within 
the Ministry of the Family is responsible for insuring a 
child\'s protection while police investigate an abuse 
violation and the district attorney\'s office prosecutes the 
abuser. A network of 112 CSWs throughout Croatia -- include 1 
central office and 13 branch offices for Zagreb -- have broad 
powers to inspect foster or temporary care facilities and 
even to terminate parental rights during an abuse case if the 
parents are a threat to the child\'s welfare. New legal 
procedures to enter into force on January 1, 2006 will give 
parents the power to appeal CSW decisions through normal 
legal channels. While she lauded the CSW\'s focus on the 
child, Matijevic-Vrsaljko expressed concern that the Centers 
for Social Welfare do not institutionally coordinate their 
activities with either the police or the district attorney. 
 
In July 2003, the former Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare 
through its National Committee on Children established a safe 
shelter in a GoC-owned facility. The shelter, upgraded with 
the help of International Organization for Migration funding, 
will provide temporary safe haven to exploitation victims as 
of August 2004. 
 
Croatians enjoy ready and widespread access to primary 
education. Under Croatian law children must complete eight 
years of compulsory education after the age of six. In 
 
practice, this means compulsory education is generally 
completed by the age of 15, though the overwhelming majority 
of Croatian students remain in school until age 18. 
 
The Croatian Constitution, the 2002 Constitutional Law on the 
Rights of National Minorities, and the 2003 Law on Education 
in the Languages of National Minorities work to extend access 
to primary schooling to Croatia\'s minority communities. The 
2003 National Program for Roma (NPR) specifically addresses 
the issue of primary schooling for Roma children in Croatia 
(the GoC estimates 1500 Roma children attended primary school 
in 2002). The NPR notes that the primary obstacles to Roma 
access to primary schooling is weak command of the Croatian 
language; accordingly, the NPR commits the GoC financially to 
provide additional teachers and pre-school instruction in 
Croatian language for Roma children valued at approximately 
$65/child per year. 
 
A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY ON CHILD LABOR 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. Does Croatia have a comprehensive policy aimed at the 
elimination of the worst forms of child labor? 
 
Croatia introduced a National Program of Action for Children 
in 1999, including programs to promote economic development, 
health, nutrition, access to safe drinking water, poverty 
relief, education support, and assistance for children 
victims of war. The Program establishes education targets of 
60% of Croatian children in pre-elementary education and 100% 
in compulsory elementary education. According to State 
Secretary for Labor Vera Babic (who sat on the drafting 
 
SIPDIS 
commission), this target has been met. 
 
In June 2004, Croatia established a working group on child 
trafficking, chaired by a representative of the National 
Human Rights Office and consisting of the Ombudsman for 
Children and representatives of the Ministries of Interior, 
Family, Science and Education, Health and Social Welfare, and 
the District Attorney\'s Office. In coordination with UNICEF, 
this working group is in the process of drafting a national 
plan for combating child trafficking but has no immediate 
plans to release any public documents. 
 
A National Program of Action for Youth passed in November 
2002 aims at establishing a long-term strategy for the social 
integration and empowerment of young people between the ages 
of 15 and 29; the National Program concerns youth job 
creation but does not address the labor exploitation of 
children younger than 15 years. 
 
Croatia has not, however, issued a public statement on 
eliminating the worst forms of child labor.

Summary and Comment 
-------------------------- 
 
1. (C) In a wide-ranging meeting on August 25, Croatia\'s 
National NATO Coordinator Pjer Simunovic told us that the 
soon-to-be finished Strategic Defense Review will drive a new 
long term vision for the Croatian armed forces based on the 
premise that Croatia should be prepared for NATO membership, 
regardless of NATO\'s timing for accession.  The GoC will 
invite ministers from Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Italy, and Turkey to observe the November 12 
Adriatic Charter Partnership Commission meeting, and attend a 
November 13-14 follow-on session.  Simunovic stressed that 
the GoC sees its niche operational role within NATO as 
providing military police, such as the unit currently serving 
in Afghanistan.  He also mentioned the possibility of 
providing special forces, combat engineering, and medical 
units to NATO and UN peacekeeping operations, as well as 
naval capabilities in the Mediterranean.  The GoC\'s primary 
challenge, beyond the domestic fiscal challenge of securing 
adequate defense budgets, was to develop and implement a 
public relations strategy to ensure the public will support 
joining NATO. 
 
2. (C) Comment:  Completion of the Strategic Defense Review 
will signal a welcome change in the right direction for 
Croatia,s defense policy, and was probably not an easy 
achievement for this government, in view of Croatia,s 
relatively recent need for a very active defense against a 
neighboring state.  Simunovic,s \"act like an ally\" 
philosophy is heartening, as is his optimism (if not 
misplaced) about maintaining defense budget levels.  We note 
that because the GoC has not signed an Article 98 agreement, 
Croatia must prepare for NATO membership without IMET and 
other assistance that new Allies found so helpful in the 
process.  END SUMMARY and COMMENT. 
 
Ready for Membership when NATO is Ready 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) In Pol/Econ Counselor,s introductory call, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs National Coordinator for NATO 
Pjer Simunovic told us that major components of Croatia\'s 
Strategic Defense Review would be completed by the end of 
2004.  This will drive a long-term defense development plan 
based on the assumption that Croatia was a full member of 
NATO.  When challenged on whether all elements of the 
military supported the transition away from territorial 
defense, Simunovic stressed that the highest levels of the 
GoC have made the political commitment to collective 
security, and that Croatian armed forces were faithfully 
developing the reform programs necessary to implement this 
policy. 
 
4. (C) The main challenge was in securing adequate resources 
to support defense reforms in a tight fiscal environment. 
However, Simunovic was confident that the Ministry of Finance 
had become more \"defense sensitive,\" and he was hopeful that 
defense budgets would stay at about 1.8 percent of GDP. 
Simunovic pointed out that this figure was based on Croatian 
budget definitions, but the figure was just over two percent 
using NATO definitions ) an ambiguity that he found helpful 
in negotiations with the Ministry of Finance. 
 
5. (C) Simunovic said that GoC strategic planning was founded 
on the goal of being fully ready for an invitation by the end 
of the current MAP cycle, i.e. the next 12-24 months. 
 
Act Like a Member 
----------------- 
 
6. (SBU) According to Simunovic, the GoC hoped to use its 
chairmanship of the Adriatic Charter (A3) to show it could 
look and act like a NATO member.  He said that the GoC was 
planning to host an A3 Partnership Commission meeting at the 
Foreign and Defense Ministerial level November 12-14 on the 
island of Briuni.  Ministers from Serbia and Montenegro and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as ministers from Turkey and 
Italy would be invited to join in expanded talks on the 
second day, following initial A3 discussions.  Note: Post 
understands that DAS Stephens provisionally accepted Foreign 
Minister Zuzul\'s invitation to participate in the Briuni 
meetings at the informal Foreign Ministerial August 6-8 in 
Dubrovnik.  End Note. 
 
Niche Contributions to Afghanistan and Iraq 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The GoC\'s Strategic Defense Review will state that 
Croatia\'s defenses must be structured to meet the same 
asymmetrical threats that its future NATO allies face -- 
terrorism and the security/humanitarian spillover from any 
continued regional instability.  Simunovic said that Croatia 
would build niche defense capabilities to meet these threats 
along the lines of its currently in place and planned 
contributions to the ISAF mission.  Croatia is now sending 
its fourth rotation of fifty military police to Afghanistan 
and finalizing its civilian contribution to the German PRT, 
which will consist of 1-2 diplomats, 2-3 civilian police, and 
a civilian medical team.  With A3 partners Albania and 
Macedonia, the GoC is also planning to send an 11 person 
medical team to Kabul this fall. 
 
8. (SBU) In addition to these contributions, Simunovic said 
that Croatia would consider developing capabilities in 
special forces and combat engineering.  The GoC is also 
finalizing concepts for civilian contributions to coalition 
efforts in Iraq, including bringing Iraqi children to Croatia 
for medical treatment (the first seven children arrived in 
Zagreb August 26), providing forensic training for Iraqi 
technicians, and contributing police trainers to the 
Coalition Police Academy in Amman, Jordan.  Simunovic added 
that the GoC also wanted to explore how it could contribute 
to maritime security beyond the Adriatic to the broader 
Mediterranean region. 
 
Public Support for NATO Membership 
---------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Simunovic noted that while broad support at the 
political level for NATO membership was unquestioned, the 
general public lacked knowledge about the advantages of 
membership for Croatia.  The new Annual National Plan will 
lay out a more sophisticated approach and timetable for a 
public relations campaign.  Although polls generally show 
public support for NATO membership hovering at the fifty 
percent level, Simunovic was confident that the GoC was at a 
good starting point.  The GoC hoped to work with Slovenia to 
absorb the lessons of its successful PR campaign in its own 
strategy.  Simunovic is organizing a workshop with the A3 
partners on strategies and techniques to promote public 
support for NATO membership.  He asked if the USG could 
provide a \"public relations specialist\" to participate in the 
workshop, provisionally scheduled for early October.  Post 
will submit a more tailored request for a participant after 
considering which skills and experience would be most 
effective.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR, Political Parties/Elections 
SUBJECT: PUMPING UP -- OPPOSITION REVIVING COALITIONS FOR LOCAL 
ELECTIONS 
 
1.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Croatia\'s current opposition parties 
learned the hard way when they lost power in the 2003 
parliamentary elections - coalitions are the key to electoral 
victory against the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).  With 
that lesson in mind, opposition leaders see local elections 
(expected next spring) as a critical opportunity to rebuild the 
partnerships they abandoned in 2003, strengthen party 
infrastructure, and set the stage for the next round of 
parliamentary elections.  This revival of opposition coalitions 
indicates a marked evolution of attitudes among party power 
brokers - a step away from the personality politics of the recent 
past that too often favor party extremists.  Local elections will 
give Croatian politicians the opportunity to prove they can 
sustain these alliances and produce a more balanced and stable 
multi-party democracy. 
 
2.  The Social Democrats (SDP) and the Peasant Party (HSS) 
announced plans for close cooperation in local elections, 
including joint candidate lists.  In a similar vein, a trio 
purporting to make up the Croatian \"civil center,\" the Croatian 
People\' Party (HNS), the Liberal Party (LS) and Libra, signed a 
coalition agreement and left open the possibility of linking up 
with their former partners in the SDP and HSS.  The ruling HDZ has 
generally avoided talk about elections; however, some house- 
cleaning moves indicate that it, too, is preparing.   The Croatian 
Party of Rights (HSP) is positioning itself to appeal to voters 
too far to the right for the reformed HDZ, but remains open to 
local coalitions with the ruling party.  Despite earlier 
posturing, most parties seem to favor the existing party ballot 
system rather than the direct election of mayors and county 
executives.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
LEARNING FROM THEIR MISTAKES 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  Croatian opposition parties are aiming for a political 
comeback by reforming the partnerships that once brought them to 
power.  The SDP, the largest opposition party, and the HSS are in 
the process of negotiating a coalition for local elections 
ordinarily due in May 2005.  This alliance is critical, as the 
independent ambitions of HSS leader Zlatko Tomcic are widely seen 
as the main reason for the previous coalition government\'s 
collapse.  In addition, while the SDP dominates urban politics, 
the HSS power base is rural, creating a complementary ticket for 
local elections.  Senior officials in both the SDP and the HSS 
told the Embassy they would seek joint lists of candidates in all 
counties and major cities across the country.  They plan to sign 
an agreement in early September, and hope to make similar 
arrangements in smaller communities.  Party leaders have also said 
they would leave the door open for other parties, especially 
former partners in the HNS and the regional Istrian Democratic 
Assembly (IDS).  The HNS, LS and Libra signed a coalition 
agreement July 18 establishing what they called a \"civil center\" 
of Croatia, and welcome cooperation with other parties, namely the 
SDP, the HSS, and the Pensioners\' Party (HSU). 
 
4.  In addition to these formal steps to rebuild the former 
coalition, political leaders from the SDP, HSS and HNS united to 
criticize government actions this summer, particularly those 
concerning road construction.  The opposition took full political 
advantage of the GOC\'s intention to expand a road construction 
contract without public tendering.  Using this \"affair\" to portray 
the HDZ-led government, and particularly some of its ministers, as 
a group pursuing private rather than national interests (the 
latter being an issue of particular sensitivity for the HDZ), the 
opposition eventually forced the government to open a full 
tendering process.  According to Post contacts, the leaders of 
these parties will continue to work together to counterbalance the 
HDZ\'s power when Parliament resumes its work later in September. 
 
TAKING OUT THE TRASH -- HDZ\'S SUMMER CLEANING AND THE FAR RIGHT 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
 
5.  The ruling HDZ has not yet publicly addressed elections. 
However, some of the party\'s and the government\'s recent moves 
indicate that they are positioning themselves for local elections. 
In July, the HDZ expelled from membership Ante Loncar, mayor of 
the economically troubled town of Imotski, for spending city funds 
on a particularly expensive official vehicle. Similarly, the 
government pressed corruption charges in August against Stipe 
Gabric Jambo, another former mayor and ex-HDZ member who has 
greatly enriched himself over the past decade, becoming a symbol 
of cronyism and dubious privatization. In its countrywide effort 
to stop illegal building, in July the government ordered the 
destruction of a house in an elite part of Zagreb belonging to a 
former prominent HDZ-er and army general Ljubo Cesic Rojs, who 
epitomizes the regime from the nineties.  While steps like these 
are welcome, opposition officials claim they are more a result of 
infighting than a genuine wish to clean party ranks and combat 
corruption, noting that these house-cleaning targets enjoyed full 
support and protection while loyal to the party and were 
conveniently hit only after they left the HDZ or when their 
interests clashed with those of other, more powerful old-school 
party members. 
 
6. The far-right Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) recently formally 
abandoned its past practice of glorifying Croatia\'s WWII fascist 
regime.  As a consequence, it won eight seats in the November 2003 
elections, doubling its strength in the national Parliament.  As 
the HDZ has moved toward the center, the HSP has been quick to 
capture the right side of the political spectrum. It launched a 
campaign this summer in support of generals indicted for or 
convicted of war crimes, including posters across Dalmatia 
picturing Mirko Norac, a Croatian general indicted by the ICTY and 
already found guilty of war crimes by a domestic court, declaring: 
\"Guilty -- of defending his homeland.\"  Similarly, the party has 
become a more vocal skeptic regarding NATO and EU membership and 
was also the only important party that had no problem with the 
recent erection of monuments in memory of Ustasha leaders.  Recent 
polls show that HSP support may have peaked, settling at 7 to 8 
percent, a number predicted by local analysts, including President 
Mesic\'s domestic policy advisor, Igor Dekanic.  COMMENT: Local 
elections could reveal the HSP\'s real strength, as they are the 
only significant party with the possibility of going into 
coalition with the HDZ.  While international considerations kept 
the HDZ from forming a national alliance with the HSP following 
the last parliamentary elections, it is less likely to avoid 
cooperation with the far right at the local level.  END COMMENT. 
 
DEBATES OVER ELECTION TIMING AND REPLACING PARTY BALLOTS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
7.  HDZ strategists have also considered how the timing of the 
local elections due in 2005 might help their cause.  The law 
requires local elections on the third Sunday of May every four 
years.  However, two high-ranking old-school HDZ-ers have made 
conflicting statements on changing the election schedule. The HDZ 
MP and party chief in Eastern Slavonia, Branimir Glavas, suggested 
in mid-July that local elections could be held together with those 
for the President around the New Year.  Although Glavas argued 
that combining the two elections would reduce organizational 
costs, opposition leaders and independent analysts suspect Glavas 
believes the HDZ would do better at combined elections than at a 
local election following their candidate\'s expected defeat in the 
presidential race (septel).  Later in July, another prominent 
party member, Deputy Speaker Luka Bebic, said that he expected 
local elections in April.  Either of the suggested dates would 
require a legislative change.  SDP SG Igor Dragovan told us in 
late August that the HDZ would have trouble getting its coalition 
partners, especially the Pensioner Party and the Independent 
Democratic Serbian Party (SDSS), to vote for changing the law, due 
to growing SDSS discontent with the slow pace the government is 
addressing their interests. Dragovan believes the HDZ chose to 
make conflicting statements about the election date to create 
confusion in the opposition. 
 
8.  There has also been intermittent debate about direct election 
of mayors and county executives (zupans). Under current law, local 
executive authorities are selected by the city councils/county 
assemblies elected on party/coalition ballots at the local 
elections.  Reformers have argued that local officials should be 
responsible directly to the citizens rather than the parties they 
come from.  All major parties have supported this view in public 
statements.  The HNS, however, is now the only major party that 
still publicly promotes a change.  While claiming that they still 
support direct election of mayors and zupans, all other relevant 
parties (HDZ, SDP, HSS) in fact favor the status quo. They 
privately offer a number of reasons: there isn\'t enough time to 
change the law; that, once elected, mayors would be unimpeachable; 
that local governments would become unstable; or even that Croatia 
is not ready for such a radical change.  Most major parties 
governing Croatian cities and counties (HDZ, SDP, HSS) are not 
ready to give up party influence on the electoral process, 
especially in places with strong individuals.  With virtually no 
debate on the issue in the run-up to local elections, it\'s likely 
the current system will remain in place.

Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
1. (C): We followed up on reftel A with Ranko Vilovic, 
Director of the Office for UN Affairs in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  Vilovic said that Prime Minister Ivo 
Sanader would lead the Croatian delegation to UNGA, although 
the final composition had not been approved.  He said Croatia 
would focus on the Secretary General\'s agenda for responding 
to global threats and challenges and reform of the UN. 
Croatia is likely to follow the EU lead at this UNGA session. 
 However, on issues where there is no EU consensus position 
) e.g. Security Council expansion ) Croatia will be more 
amenable to U.S. lobbying.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
2. (C) CROATIA\'S UNGA TEAM: The MFA\'s Director for UN Affairs 
Ranko Vilovic told us on Sept. 3 that Prime Minister Ivo 
Sanader would lead the Croatian delegation to UNGA.  The 
final composition of the delegation did not have final 
approval yet, but Vilovic said that the following people 
would most likely join the PM on Croatia\'s UNGA team: 
 
Miomir Zuzul ) Foreign Minister 
Bianka Matkovic ) State Secretary and Chief of Staff to the 
Prime Minister 
Miroslav Kovacic ) State Secretary and Director of the 
Government office for e-Croatia 
Aleksander Heina ) Chief of Staff to the Foreign Minister 
Tomislav Vidosevic ) Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs

Ambassador Neven Jurica ) Ambassador to the U.S. 
 
Possible additions to the team yet to be determined are: 
 
Ivan Suker ) Minister of Finance 
Ranko Vilovic ) Director for UN Affairs, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs 
 
3. (C) CROATIA\'S UNGA PRIORITIES:  Vilovic provided us with 
the preliminary overview of Croatia\'s priorities for the 
coming UNGA.  Although these priorities were not yet approved 
by his leadership, Vilovic did not expect any major changes. 
In priority order, Croatia will focus on: 
 
A)  Working to support the Secretary General\'s initiatives on 
responding to global threats and global challenges. 
 
B) Reform of the UN including Security Council reform. 
Vilovic said that traditionally Croatia had supported the 
German and Japanese proposals for expanding the UNSC P-5 to 
10 and adding four or five new non-permanent seats.  The GoC 
was more interested in expansion of the Security Council than 
in addressing the issues of reform of the P-5 veto.  Croatia 
would support any solution to reform the Council in hopes 
that a compromise will emerge. 
 
C) Developing International Counter-Terrorism Cooperation 
including implementation of UNSCR 1535 or any other 
developments in this direction. 
 
D) Post Conflict Management.  Croatia has direct experience 
and hopes to increase its contributions in this area, 
particularly in peacekeeping operations.  The GoC would like 
to make a high profile effort in this area, particularly in 
light of its bid for a UNSC seat for 2009-10. 
 
E) Millenium Declaration.  Vilovic said that the GoC\'s 
assessment was that implementation of the Declaration was not 
going well and that the 2005 High Level Plenary to assess 
progress would not have a good outcome unless implementation 
can get back on track.  The GoC\'s first report was getting a 
final polishing and would be ready for submission soon. 
 
F) Development issues. The GoC will look to support 
initiatives on the Commission for Sustainable Development as 
well as forward movement on the Monterrey Consensus. 
 
G) The GoC Human Rights. Croatia\'s term on the UNHRC is 
expiring.  However, GoC will support in particular efforts on 
UNSCR 1324, the Protocol on Torture, and the Convention on 
Rights of Vulnerable Groups. 
 
H) Disarmament and Non-Proliferation.  Croatia has the Chair 
of the Ottawa process and will focus energies there, as well 
as on implementing CTBT. 
 
I) ICTY. Vilovic repeated the mantra that GoC is fully 
cooperating with The Hague Tribunal and will continue to do 
 
so.

1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Patrick Lopez-Terres, Chief of 
Investigations in the ICTY Office of the Prosecutor, has 
expressed enthusiastic support for Croatian Chief State 
Prosecutor Mladen Bajic,s initiative to pursue bilateral 
cooperation agreements between the state prosecutors of the 
countries of the former Yugoslavia (ref A).  In a September 6 
meeting with the Ambassador, Lopez-Terres hailed the State 
Prosecutor,s work, adding that Bajic,s new plan 
demonstrated exactly the spirit of cooperation the ICTY needs 
to succeed in its exit strategy.  Bajic is currently 
providing extensive witness and evidence support to SAM,s 
state prosecutor in the Ovcara Farm war crimes case and is 
searching for ways to ensure that his colleague in Belgrade 
can reciprocate, despite political atmospherics (ref B). 
Bajic is skillfully floating his idea with the international 
community to win support before he gets any resistance from 
within the GOC or its neighbors.  Once Bajic presents 
specifics, the Ambassador proposed early Embassy intervention 
with key political leaders to ensure the prosecutor,s plan 
succeeds domestically. 
 
2.  (C)  Lopez-Terres assessed Bajic,s coordinating role in 
the GOC,s ongoing hunt for Ante Gotovina as extremely 
positive but said the quality of actual police work continues 
to be mixed, and the goal ) Gotovina in The Hague ) does 
not appear much closer.  According to Lopez-Terres, Bajic 
claims to be making progress in improving police attitudes, 
particularly in Gotovina,s hometown of Zadar, but only with 
extraordinary effort.  Bajic plans &more aggressive and 
visible8 police tactics to push the investigation forward. 
Post has no doubt about the prosecutor,s political will, but 
until the GOC removes the members of the police Lopez-Terres 
said have posters supporting Gotovina in their lockers, Bajic 
will continue to face an uphill battle.  END SUMMARY AND 
COMMENT. 
 
PROSECUTOR,S TRIAL BALLOON WINS ICTY SUPPORT 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  According to Lopez-Terres, Bajic has already drafted 
a model bilateral agreement on prosecutor cooperation and 
will soon present it to the MOJ.  Bajic, who has excellent 
relations with his colleagues in the region, hopes to create 
a direct communication channel between state prosecutors, 
bypassing the diplomatic formalities of Mutual Legal 
Assistance and minimizing delays in witness appearances or 
evidence transfer - delays that could unhinge ICTY,s exit 
strategy. 
 
4.  (C)  In addition to selling ICTY on his plan, Bajic has 
met with us as well as the OSCE and other multilateral 
organizations, seeking the international support he will need 
to overcome any political obstacles to his idea. 
Lopez-Terres doubted that politicians would object to the 
substance of Bajic,s proposal, but there may be turf issues 
with MFA or others as the state prosecutor strays outside the 
strict definitions of his mandate.  Bajic is also likely 
counting on prosecutorial agreements to help him survive 
professionally if a lack of cooperation on the part of a 
neighboring government stalls his prosecution of cases 
transferred from the ICTY. 
 
5.  (C)  When Bajic has finalized his plan, the Ambassador 
proposed to Lopez-Terres that the Embassy could assist by 
expressing USG support early for the concept to MFA and PM, 
noting that we want to ensure that Bajic has all the tools he 
needs.  Post could also go to President Mesic, the Ambassador 
added, and highlight that we look forward to his support on 
this potential issue in his re-election campaign. 
 
CASE TRANSFERS CRITICAL TO ICTY EXIT 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  Lopez-Terres made it clear that ICTY judges are 
 
counting on the success of case transfers.  While ICTY will 
retain oversight, Lopez-Terres noted with a smile that 
pulling cases back to The Hague would be &incompatible with 
our exit strategy.8  He reported that ICTY views Croatia as 
the most prepared country in the region to accept case 
transfers.  The retrial in the Lora Prison case (ref C) will 
be a key opportunity for the Croatian judiciary to prove this 
readiness.

SUBJECT: MESIC RE-ELECTION ALL BUT CERTAIN, HDZ IN 
DAMAGE-CONTROL MODE 
 
REF: ZAGREB 01571 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank for reasons 1.5 (b) & (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: As the most popular Croatian 
politician by a double-digit margin with no realistic 
opponent, President Stjepan Mesic is almost assured of 
coasting to re-election at year\'s end.  Mesic has opposed key 
U.S. initiatives (troops to Iraq and Article 98), and is not 
expected to change in a second term, but he has otherwise 
been a positive force for Euro-Atlantic integration.  His 
likely re-election is a welcome sign of solid public support 
for centrist politics in Croatia. 
2.  (C)  The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which 
has yet to name a presidential candidate, seems to have given 
up hopes of unseating Mesic and is focusing instead on 
minimizing the damage the presidential campaign could have on 
the HDZ\'s showing in local elections expected in May 2005 
(reftel).  Having reached the end of any honeymoon it might 
have enjoyed after coming to power in November 2003, the HDZ 
faces simmering public dissatisfaction with government and is 
late to select a candidate.  Seeing no benefit in a lopsided 
loss to Mesic, some HDZ leaders ask whether the party should 
back any nominee at all.  Public support for potential 
candidates from within government is lukewarm at best, 
recently prompting the party to commission a poll of 2,000 
HDZ voters regarding who should be their presidential 
candidate.  Speculation about names from academia and 
athletics indicate the HDZ likely sees any candidate it puts 
up against Mesic as a sacrificial lamb; the eventual 
candidate is unlikely to be closely or historically 
associated with the party. Science, Education and Sport 
Minister Dragan Primorac, one of the more popular government 
figures and not an HDZ member, could be a compromise choice. 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
FIVE MORE YEARS: PRESIDENT MESIC ON ROAD TO RE-ELECTION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) With support pledged or expected from essentially all 
of Croatia,s opposition parties, including the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP), the Croatian People\'s Party (HNS), 
and the Liberal, Peasants\' and Istrian Parties (LS, HSS, and 
IDS), local analysts agree that barring a dramatic change in 
circumstances, the contest to be called between December 18 
and January 18 is Mesic\'s election to lose.  His only 
declared opponent to date is Slaven Letica of the right 
fringe Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), which consistently 
polls in the single digits.  Current polls suggest Mesic may 
achieve the required simple majority in the first round of 
the election, eliminating the need for a second round two 
weeks later. 
 
4.  (U)  Constitutional changes during Mesic\'s term reduced 
presidential powers significantly from the era of Franjo 
Tudjman, reshaping the office into a traditional Head of 
State.  Mesic, however, retains important foreign policy 
influence through ambassadorial and intelligence service 
appointments as well as in his role as Commander-in-Chief of 
the Croatian Armed Forces. 
 
HDZ TURNS TO THE MAN ON THE STREET 
---------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  HDZ leaders seem perplexed by the presidential race. 
 Fiscal realities have de-railed several of the party\'s key 
campaign promises, including pension reform and tax relief, 
and a few controversial government decisions (notably the 
razing of houses constructed without permits and a traffic 
law setting a blood alcohol limit of zero) have party 
strategists nervous about public support.  A stunning 
municipal by-election loss to the SDP in Pozega in central 
Slavonia this week despite high-level campaign support from 
Zagreb has only added to HDZ nail biting. 
 
6.  (U)  Rumors have circulated for weeks about HDZ 
candidates ranging from Deputy PM Andrija Hebrang and Speaker 
of Parliament Vladimir Seks to MFA Miomir Zuzul, Minister of 
Science, Education and Sport Dragan Primorac, and PM Ivo 
Sanader himself, but the prospect of being selected as the 
HDZ presidential nominee seems increasingly like a bad card 
to draw.  Early favorite Jadranka Kosor, Deputy PM and 
Minister of Family, Veterans Affairs and Intergenerational 
Solidarity, went from media darling in early summer to being 
heckled from the stage at a public celebration for Olympic 
medallists in late August.  Perhaps prophetically, one of the 
 
 
guests of honor at that event was Lino Cervar, first-time MP 
and coach of Croatia\'s gold medal handball team ) the most 
recent name to surface in HDZ\'s search for an appealing 
candidate. 
 
7.  With the press speculating that Croatia,s largest party 
has no match for Mesic, members are likely to insist in the 
HDZ\'s upcoming poll that any candidate is better than none. 
HDZ leaders, to distance themselves from the seemingly 
inevitable loss, are likely to choose a candidate whose HDZ 
ties are not deep.  Science minister Primorac could fill the 
bill: although almost certain to lose against Mesic, he would 
run a credible race (polls show he is one of the more popular 
members of the government) and because he lacks long-term 
ties to HDZ, would cost the party little.

SUBJECT:  ICTY Indictees\' Children Supported on Humanitarian 
Grounds 
 
1. (SBU)  State Secretary Tomislav Ivic of the Ministry of 
Veterans and Family told Embassy officers on September 13 that the 
Government\'s May 12 decision to give school allowances to the 
children of Croats indicted by The Hague-based War Crime Tribunal 
(ICTY) was based on \"humanitarian considerations.\"   Ivic denied 
the decision was politically motivated. He said Minister Kosor had 
passed it, in consultation with Prime Minister Sanader, strictly 
on humanitarian grounds, to help the families of the indictees to 
cope with increased expenses (travel to The Hague, frequent long 
distance phone calls, etc.). 
 
2. (U) The decision caused quite a stir in the Croatian press 
during the slow news month of August. Human rights activists 
charged that the decision was unconstitutional as it discriminated 
against Croatian Serb indictees, as well as those being tried for 
war crimes locally. Critics also argued that most indictees were 
wealthy individuals in no need of state support, describing the 
government\'s decision as a sort of payoff to those who helped it 
improve its relations with ICTY by voluntarily surrendering. 
 
3. (U) Ivic said that, contrary to public perception, most 
families of ICTY indictees were not well off financially, adding 
that the wealthier among them (e.g. General Cermak) declined such 
support. When taking the decision, GOC bore in mind the 
presumption of innocence, as the allowance applies only to those 
indicted, not to those convicted. The allowance itself amounts to 
500 kuna (about USD 80) a month for pre-school and school 
children, and 1000 kuna (USD160) for college students. This year\'s 
appropriation is 150,000 kuna ($25,000) through December 2004. 
Ivic could not predict whether the program would be renewed. 
Asked what would happen if an indictee were found guilty, Ivic 
cited the case of General Blaskic (who was convicted, served time 
and was released), whose children no longer received government 
support, as a precedent. 
 
4. (SBU) Given the minor amounts involved, we doubt there was a 
real political quid-pro-quo involved in the GOC\'s decision. 
Nevertheless it created a small local backlash and undermined to a 
small degree the GOC\'s public commitment to doing the right thing 
with indictees; a wiser minister might seek to provide allowances 
for impoverished indictees\' families though a less controversial 
mechanism next year.

SUBJECT: ENVIRONMENT COULD BE STICKING POINT IN CROATIA\'S 
EU NEGOTIATIONS 
 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
1. (SBU) Environmental protection issues seem certain to be 
a major sticking point in Croatia\'s EU membership 
negotiations.  With the European Commission playing an 
ever-smaller role in environmental policy priority setting, 
the chaotic distribution of environmental responsibility 
among Croatian ministries and agencies and disinterest on 
the part of local governments could slow the negotiating 
process. 
 
2.  (SBU) Implementation remains the largest concern. 
While Croatia might reasonably expect to receive long 
transition periods for environmental approximation based on 
the experience of the 10 newest members, the GoC will still 
have to demonstrate that the appropriate legislation exists 
and that it has a concrete plan for implementation.  Based 
on the starting point, the environmental chapter of the 
acquis could be among the hardest to close.  END SUMMARY 
AND COMMENT. 
 
3. (SBU) Responsibility for environmental policy is diffuse 
by EU standards; according to contacts in the EC delegation 
to Croatia, the Ministry of Environment has competency for 
just about 50% of EU environmental directives.  The 
Ministries of Health, Transportation, Agriculture, and 
Economy also have authority over pieces of environmental 
policy.  This chaotic division of labor makes it extremely 
difficult to judge to what degree Croatian law tracks with 
the environmental acquis.  Moreover, the GoC has not 
completed any systematic review of existing Croatian 
environmental legislation. 
 
4. (SBU) As EC CARDS assistance to Croatia wraps up this 
year, environmental assistance will reappear as pre- 
accession aid once the Commission releases Croatia\'s pre- 
accession strategy in October.  CARDS funding for current 
projects -- legislative approximation, drinking water 
quality monitoring, and waste management -- will expire 
this year.  Though environmental priorities (air quality, 
water quality, and industrial pollution control) are 
unlikely to change after CARDS, Croatia will have more 
responsibility in terms of priority setting and will have a 
co-financing requirement on all projects.  According to our 
contact, the EC does not push its environmental priorities 
but finds the GoC receptive to their suggestions.

SUBJECT: EMBASSY COMMENTS ON ICRAS RATING REVEIW FOR CROATIA 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified -- please protect accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) Embassy Zagreb supports proposal to maintain 
Croatia\'s ICRAS rating on sovereign debt at the current C 
minus, and to increase the non-sovereign risk rating to C 
minus. 
 
2.  (SBU) While the fiscal and current account deficits 
warrant close monitoring, and the failure of Croatia to 
complete its last Stand-by Arrangement must be recognized, we 
agree with the drafters of the Country Risk Assessment Report 
that Croatia is at a different place economically and 
politically than it was in 2001, when the ICRAS ratings were 
last determined. 
 
3.  (SBU) We would stress the following factors: 
 
-- The banking sector has been revamped since the beginning 
of the decade, and is one of the most open and sophisticated 
in the region.  Central Bank measures to slow the inflow of 
money to the banks -- flows that have fueled an import boom 
-- appear to be working. 
 
-- The worst of the fiscal deficits (2003) and current 
account deficits (2002) appear to be behind us, and should 
the government keep close to its announced targets, the twin 
deficits should be under control.  (The ability of the new 
government to keep to its ambitious budget targets remains 
untested.  Should Croatia be unable to keep the current SBA 
on-track, the ratings might need to be revisited.) 
 
-- The beginning of EU negotiations early next year and the 
desire of the government to close the gap between its 
accession track and those of Romania and Bulgaria will 
provide a powerful incentive for the GOC to ratchet down the 
deficits.  The EU has been a very effective proponent of 
Croatia keeping within an IMF program and the fiscal 
discipline that encourages -- it was key in causing the new 
government to pursue a new agreement.

Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d). 
 
1. (C) Clearly surprised and embarrassed by press revelations 
that fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina\'s wife had 
been granted a new position within the Croatian Armed Forces 
Joint Staff, Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul told the 
Ambassador on September 16 that the Ministry of Defense will 
\"solve this problem today.\"  Dunja Zloic Gotovina, herself a 
former soldier and the Croatian Army\'s first female colonel, 
was reportedly assigned to the office for international 
military cooperation after a seven-year paid absence from 
service as an \"unassigned officer,\" but will apparently soon 
be retired. 
 
2. (U) Dunja Gotovina\'s assignment had reportedly been a 
political problem the MOD had tried to avoid as long as 
possible, repeatedly delaying resolution of her ambiguous 
status and encouraging her to accept a private sector job. 
She refused to leave the service, according to the press, 
insisting that she not be held responsible for her husband\'s 
actions and that she receive a position in line with her 
rank. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT: The MFA\'s rapid reaction to public 
revelations about Gotovina\'s wife indicate the GOC\'s 
increasing sensitivity to events that could leave the 
international community with the impression that it supports 
accused war criminals.  As soon as the issue appeared in the 
press (Zuzul said the political leadership had no advance 
warning), the government took action. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: ICTY: SURPRISE OVER CERMAK/MARKAC, NO FANFARE FOR 
BOSNIAN CROATS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d). 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Croatian government officials and 
political leaders expressed surprise and disappointment at 
the ICTY trial chamber\'s September 14 decision against 
provisional release of Generals Mladen Markac and Ivan 
Cermak, particularly in the wake of their voluntary surrender 
to the Court and the recent release of six Bosnian Croat 
indictees who were permitted to return to Croatia while 
awaiting their trial.  The court used the GOC\'s failure to 
deliver fugitive general Ante Gotovina to support its lack of 
confidence in state guarantees for the Markac/Cermak release. 
 
2. (C) The GOC undoubtedly hoped that the tightly controlled 
Zagreb arrival of the six Bosnian Croats a week earlier had 
demonstrated the seriousness of government guarantees related 
to provisional releases.  The conspicuous lack of press 
statements and absence of nationalist crowds at the airport 
for the six contrasted sharply with previous \"homecomings\" 
from the ICTY; the GOC made an effort to show it can manage 
public aspects of indictee releases. Anti-ICTY public 
sentiment gained a temporary boost, but the GOC will support 
the decision.   END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
SUPPORTING THE DECISION AND THE APPEAL 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Despite political rumblings on the continued detention 
of Cermak and Markac, accused of war crimes in southern 
Croatia in 1995, Assistant Minister of Justice for ICTY 
Cooperation Jaksa Muljacic assured the Embassy September 15 
that MOJ Vesna Skare-Ozbolt will publicly stand by the 
ruling. \"A court decision is a court decision,\" Muljacic 
stressed, quietly adding that Skare-Ozbolt will also support 
the generals, appeal expected September 20. 
 
4.  (C) The ruling against release will confuse Croatian 
public opinion, he said, considering that ICTY\'s Chief 
Prosecutor opposed the release of the Bosnian Croats but did 
not oppose the release of the two Croatian generals. 
According to Muljacic, this decision will stall the steady 
growth in public acceptance of the ICTY - important in 
setting the stage for the eventual capture of Gotovina, 
former commander of both Markac and Cermak. 
 
ALL QUIET AT PLESO AIRPORT 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) Jadranko Prlic, Berislav Pusic, Bruno Stojic, 
Valentin Coric and Generals Slobodan Praljak and Milivoj 
Petkovic, all former political and military leaders of the so 
called Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna, made no public 
statements upon arrival in Croatia September 9, where they 
will await their trial in The Hague.  Whisking indictees and 
their families past the press, it appears the GOC is making a 
concerted effort to control public events likely to stir 
lingering anti-ICTY sentiments.  The ICTY indicted the six in 
April 2004 for war crimes related to the persecution of 
Bosnian Muslims in areas controlled by the Croatian Defense 
Council (HVO) from 1991 to 1994. 
 
5.  (U) The almost unnoticed arrival of the six was in stark 
contrast to the early August homecoming of General Tihomir 
Blaskic, which attracted several hundred supporters and 
created a minor media frenzy.  Unlike Blaskic, who was 
released after the ICTY reduced his sentence, the six Bosnian 
Croats are still awaiting trial and will remain under a gag 
order during their house arrest.  In addition, Blaskic was 
widely viewed by the Croatian public as a martyr paying for 
the crimes of others after receiving a 45-year sentence in 
2000, the longest handed down by ICTY judges at the time. 
Prlic and company are still somewhat undefined in Croatian 
eyes. 
 
THE TRANSFER TEMPEST 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Thomas Osorio, head of the ICTY office in Zagreb, 
immediately dismissed comments appearing in the national 
press from Croat member of the Bosnian Presidency Dragan 
Covic claiming that this case would be transferred to Croatia 
or Bosnia.  While ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte is 
watching how Croatians react to release of the six Bosnian 
Croats to gauge the country\'s readiness for case transfers in 
terms of \"atmospherics,\" according to Osorio, she has no 
intention of requesting the transfer of this case.

SUBJECT: CROATIAN POLITICAL SPECTRUM UNITED AGAINST TROOPS 
TO IRAQ, ARTICLE 98 FOLLOWING BUSH REMARKS 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. (SBU) President Bush\'s widely publicized written reply to 
Ambassador Neven Jurica on Jurica\'s presentation of 
credentials has united and solidified Croatia\'s diverse 
political parties in opposition to sending troops to Iraq or 
signing an Article 98 agreement with us.  Although some 
commentators have emphasized the strong message in the letter 
on the GoC\'s responsibility to ensure ICTY fugitive Ante 
Gotovina is apprehended and transferred to The Hague, the 
bulk of the reaction has been against the letter\'s call to 
send troops to Iraq.  Public comment has ignored the letter\'s 
welcoming tone toward Croatia\'s Euro-Atlantic integration. 
Given the Croatian public\'s broad opposition to the war in 
Iraq and President Mesic\'s long-standing position of seeking 
a UN mandate, such a response is hardly surprising.  One 
respected commentator, Bruno Lopandic, perhaps captured the 
mood in Zagreb best in his editorial when he noted that 
President Bush\'s letter had shown that Gotovina, troops to 
Iraq, and Article 98 remain central to the U.S. agenda with 
Croatia and that it was time to end the self-deception of 
some Croatian politicians that these issues would fade in 
importance with a Republican Administration.  END SUMMARY AND 
COMMENT. 
 
2. (U) The reaction to President Bush\'s letter to new 
Croatian Ambassador to the U.S. Neven Jurica on Jurica\'s 
presentation of credentials was quick and uniform across the 
Croatian political spectrum.  In broadly replayed comments to 
the media, President Mesic repeated his standard comment that 
he would only support a Croatian troop contribution under a 
UN mandate and UN command.  However, Mesic refused to support 
UNSG Annan\'s charge that the Iraq operation was \"illegal,\" 
commenting that, \"Military operations in Iraq, carried out by 
the United States and its allies, have certainly helped to 
topple the dictatorial regime and establish peace in that 
part of the world which must be democratized.  It is not up 
to me to judge how the operation has been conducted and 
whether it was launched prematurely.\" 
 
3. (U) Opposition parties from the left, center and right 
have all endorsed president Mesic\'s position that a UN 
mandate is required before Croatia would contribute troops. 
The chief foreign policy advisor of the SDP, the main 
left-center opposition party, Zoran Milanovic commented that 
Croatia should be cautious even about sending instructors to 
the NATO-run military training academy when NATO itself 
cannot agree on a position.  Even the ruling HDZ was very 
non-committal following the release of the letter.  Kresimir 
Cosic, the HDZ parliamentarian and chief of the Croatian 
delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, commented 
that, \"I think that involvement of Croatia in such an 
unsettled situation in Iraq would be a very sensitive issue.\" 
 
4. (U) Some press reports noted the mention of Article 98 in 
the President\'s letter, reporting that the GoC has been 
polling the opposition parties to gauge support for signing a 
non-surrender agreement.  According to these reports, all 
political parties are firmly against signing such an 
agreement with the U.S., with one report quoting sources in 
President Mesic\'s office that there would be no Article 98 
agreement as long as Croatia was sending indictees to The 
Hague.

IMPROVE COOPERATION WITH U.S. 
 
 
Classified By: PolOff Justin Friedman, reasons 1.4 (b), (c) & (d) 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. (S) With the confirmation of Veselko Grubisic as new 
Director of the Croatian Intelligence Agency (OA), the GoC is 
asserting positive control over the intel services.  Along 
with new chief of Counterintelligence Agency (POA) Josko 
Podbevsek, (named earlier this year), Grubisic should be more 
willing to cooperate with us and more forceful in pursuit of 
ICTY fugitive general Gotovina.  President Mesic appears to 
have approved this move despite previously telling the 
Ambassador he opposed putting a party person at the top of 
the OA.  The press speculates that the GoC will recreate the 
National Security Bureau (NSB) to coordinate among the three 
intel services (including military intelligence), with former 
NSB head and President Mesic loyalist Tomislav Karamarko 
returning to run it, although Karamarko may not be 
confirmable in this position.  We will welcome these changes 
for their promise of improving our intel cooperation, but 
will watch closely for signs of the services straying back 
into political waters.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
2. (U) On September 15 the Parliamentary Committee on 
Internal Affairs and National Security upheld the nomination 
of Veselko Grubisic as the new Director of the Intelligence 
Agency (OA).  Grubisic was jointly proposed by President 
Mesic and Prime Minister Sanader to replace outgoing OA chief 
Damir Loncaric, who had recently announced his resignation. 
 
3. (C) Loncaric was forced out of his position in large part 
due to pressure on Mesic by Western governments for his 
removal.  Media have speculated that Loncaric was leaving as 
part of an understanding between the President and the PM 
whereby Mesic would agree to Sanader bringing his people to 
the leading positions in the intelligence community in 
exchange for a) HDZ not running a negative campaign against 
him during the presidential race, and b) re-establishing a 
supervisory and coordination body (such as the former 
National Security Bureau) which would be headed by someone of 
his choice.  Parliament may be unwilling to approve 
recreating the NSB; opposition parties fear a return to the 
unsavory mix of intel and politics of the Tudjman era. 
 
4. (C) Mesic\'s former campaign chief and National Security 
Bureau head Tomislav Karamarko has publicly denied rumors 
that he would return to the post.  Karamarko told Emboff only 
that he would be meeting with Mesic this week, but Karamarko 
did not contradict his business partners at the Soboli 
security consulting firm when they asserted that they fully 
expect him to leave the private sector and take up a 
recreated NSB post in the coming months.  We have heard 
rumors that Karamarko has political skeletons in his closet 
that may make him unconfirmable, should this post be created. 
 
5. (S) Veselko Grubisic is a veteran of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, and prior to his appointment was Assistant 
Minister in charge of security analysis and communications 
security.  In February 2004, he co-led the GoC delegation to 
Washington for the Senior Policy Exchange on Export Control 
Issues.  FM Zuzul designated Grubisic as our primary point of 
contact with MFA on intelligence issues, including the search 
for Gotovina. 
 
6. (U) Earlier in his diplomatic career Grubisic dealt with 
NATO and international security issues.  From 1991 to 1996 he 
lived in Sydney, Australia where he managed an electronic 
company and led the local HDZ chapter in 1995-96.  During his 
confirmation hearing testimony, Grubisic told the Sabor 
Committee that his focus would be business intelligence. 
Grubisic holds an M.A. in international relations and B.S. in 
mechanical engineering.  The press has reported his close 
links with Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul and current 
Ambassador to the U.S. Neven Jurica. 
 
7. (U) The new deputy chief of OA, Stribor Kikerec (whose 
appointment was announced in the press in June) comes from 
inside the intelligence community.  Until recently he was 
chief of the OA station in Moscow.  Earlier in his career he 
was an assistant director of HIS, the intelligence agency 
that has now been replaced by OA.  The press notes that he 
was Sanader\'s personal choice, in much the same way as was 
the new chief of Counterintelligence Agency (POA) Josko 
Podbevsek, who replaced Franjo Turek earlier this year. 
Together with President Mesic\'s former national security 
advisor Zeljko Bagic, Turek was reported to be in touch with 
people from organized criminal circles that allegedly assist 
fugitive general Ante Gotovina, and therefore had to go.

SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. (C) Poloff met with MFA Head of Cooperative Security 
Section Drazen Hrastic on September 13 to discuss ref B 
guidance on how Croatia could enhance its participation in 
the Proliferation Security Initiative.  The GoC hopes to have 
its PSI interagency process and points of contact settled by 
the end of this year and would continue to seek guidance from 
Poland on this process.  Preparations for negotiating a 
bilateral shipboarding agreement with the U.S. will, at best, 
be completed by the end of this year.  The GoC will try to 
stress PSI-linked counter-WMD activities in its cooperative 
exercises with Adriatic Charter (A3) partners Albania and 
Macedonia.  We will continue to urge that the GoC get its own 
house in order and establish points of contact beyond the MFA 
to facilitate Croatia\'s participation in PSI.  END SUMMARY 
AND COMMENT. 
 
2. (C) Hrastic elaborated on ref A points that the GoC would 
organize its PSI activities as a subset of the work of an 
interagency National Commission for WMD and non-proliferation 
issues involving representatives from the Ministries of 
Foreign Affairs, Interior (police), Defense, Economy (export 
control), and Finance (Customs) plus the intelligence 
services.  The MFA would likely chair the Commission at the 
Assistant Minister level or higher.  He said that the 
Government of Poland would be assisting in creating this 
Commission.  Subsequently, Polish Embassy counselor Dariusz 
Wisniewski told us that PSI cooperation would be one of the 
main issues on the Polish agenda for President Mesic\'s 
upcoming visit to Warsaw Sept. 26-27.  Wisniewski said that 
the Polish Undersecretary of State (no name given) will be 
visiting Zagreb in the first week of October in part to 
strengthen Polish-Croatian military-to-military and 
military-industrial relations, as well as to follow up on PSI 
consultations. 
 
3. (C) Hrastic siad that the GoC was just starting to review 
the model text for the bilateral shipboarding agreement.  He 
speculated that it would be difficult to have full 
interagency agreement on the text before the end of this 
calendar year.  Hrastic\'s personal view was that there would 
not be any serious difficulties with any of the main points 
in the agreement, but given the number of ministries and 
agencies involved, it would take some time to reach internal 
consensus.  That said, Hrastic was confident that the 
agreement had political support, but that the GoC may ask the 
U.S. to help lobby to secure parliamentary approval when we 
reach that stage. 
 
4. (C) In response to the upcoming schedule of PSI 
activities, Hrastic repeated the offer for Croatia to host 
some kind of exercise in the future.  He said that as the GoC 
reviewed options for possible Adriatic Charter (A3) 
exercises, most thinking centered on WMD interdiction related 
activities which could naturally be of interest for other PSI 
participants in the Adriatic and/or Mediterranian region. 
This would be an important item for the A3 Foreign Ministers 
meeting which Croatia will host in November.

SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. (SBU) As rhetoric on border questions between Slovenia and 
Croatia escalates before the October 3 Slovenian 
parliamentary election, Croatia calls for arbitration and 
rejects as blackmail recent Slovenian threats to use the EU 
card. The potential for violence is small, but each side will 
continue to claim jurisdiction over the same small wedges of 
sea and land. 
 
2. (U) There are three intertwined issues:  the maritime 
boundary, the land border (probably more important as a 
bargaining chip in the maritime border dispute), and 
Croatia\'s declaration of a fishing and environmental zone due 
to go into effect October 3 (see septel). Croatian and 
Slovenian leaders have for weeks exchanged insults and 
accusations blurring the distinction among these issues. 
 
3. (SBU) Though pre-election politicking can explain harsh 
statements and provocative stunts by both sides, the serious 
issues of Slovenia\'s self-image as a maritime nation and 
Croatia\'s inferiority complex vis-a-vis Slovenia have kept 
the boundary issue alive since independence and will continue 
to do so even after Slovenia\'s October 3 election. Before it 
received official EU candidate status, the GoC had to 
backtrack on the fishing and environmental protection zone. 
However, the GoC is not strong enough to weather any further 
bilateral compromise on the border issue.  The GoC hopes to 
resolve the boundary issue through arbitration before its EU 
entry, but the fact remains that a \"no\" vote by any EU member 
can delay or derail Croatia\'s EU aspirations.   END SUMMARY 
AND COMMENT. 
 
MARITIME BOUNDARY 
----------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Croatia bases its maritime boundary case on its 
reading of the UN Convention on the Law of Sea, which the MFA 
legal department claims establishes guidelines for delimiting 
territorial seas in bays based on \"equidistance.\" (Comment: 
UNCLOS also allows for exceptions based on historical title 
or special circumstance.) Despairing of a negotiated solution 
that would meet its political needs, the GoC notes in all 
public statements its strong preference for binding 
arbitration. 
 
5. (SBU) Controversy surrounds a 2001 agreement between 
Croatia and Slovenia (always referred to by Croatian 
authorities as a \"draft\" document), which was initialed by 
then-PM Racan\'s representative but repudiated by Parliament 
and never signed. The GoC maintains the agreement has no 
legal force. The document, which was never published but 
apparently grants Slovenia a corridor through the Adriatic in 
order to give it \"contact\" with the open sea, caused a 
national uproar and nearly brought down Racan\'s government. 
The Croatian MFA has expressed frustration at GoS insistence 
in keeping the 2001 document alive. 
 
LAND BORDER 
----------- 
 
6. (U) Increased tension over the maritime boundary has 
deepened divisions over the land border. Stunts and 
provocations by both sides -- police interdictions of fishing 
vessels, protests at border crossings, and most recently the 
September 22 arrest of several Slovenian parliamentarians by 
Croatian police for refusing to provide identity papers while 
crossing an international border -- kept the controversy in 
the headlines throughout August and September (ref c). 
 
7. (SBU) On the land border issue, the GoC cites the opinion 
of the Badinter Commission, a group of legal experts 
established by the EU in the early 1990s to determine borders 
within the former Yugoslavia.  According to the Badinter 
Commission, in the absence of agreement otherwise, the 
international borders of the new states should be the same as 
the internal borders of the Yugoslav Republics.  This 
\"Badinter principle\" is noted in both the Croatian and 
Slovenian declarations of independence.  Thus, the GoC 
considers the land border question closed.  (NOTE: The 
Badinter group did not address the maritime boundary, as 
there were no internal maritime borders in the former 
Yugoslavia.) 
 
8.  (SBU) The MFA asserts that the repudiated 2001 initialed 
agreement made only small administrative changes to the land 
border, on an equal land swap basis with Slovenia.  Slovenian 
press reports characterize these as major land concessions, 
 
but if that was the case, it was not sufficient to appease 
the Croatian parliament. 
 
FISHING AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ZONE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) These maritime boundary and land border problems 
have intensified at an inopportune time, just before 
Croatia,s Fishing and Environmental Protection Zone (FEPZ) 
in the northern Adriatic enters into force October 3.  As a 
political concession to Italy and Slovenia in the run-up to a 
decision on Croatian EU candidate status, the Zone will not 
apply to EU member states (reftels A and C). The latest 
chapter in a muddled history on Adriatic fishing rights, 
including a 1996 bilateral non-interdiction agreement for 
Slovenian and Croatian fishermen, the FEPZ will give Croatia 
authority to interdict only non-EU flag vessels fishing in 
the zone.  Since the bilateral non-interdiction agreement 
expired with Slovenia\'s EU accession in May 2004, Slovenian 
police have begun stopping Croatian flagged fishing vessels 
(reftel B) and Croatian police have responded by escorting 
Croatian fishermen operating near the equidistance boundary. 
 
WON\'T GO AWAY AFTER OCTOBER 3 
----------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) While much of recent Slovenian rhetoric seems to 
be political electioneering, this is a long-festering dispute 
that matters deeply to both countries.  According to the MFA 
and EC delegation contacts, EU accession will not solve the 
maritime boundary question because the EU has no competency 
over territorial seas.  Croatian officials fear Slovenia will 
block Croatia,s EU entry, but anything other than 
international arbitration will be impossible for the GoC to 
sell to its public.

MARITIME BOUNDARY 
 
REF: (A) ZAGREB 1077 (B) ZAGREB 1737 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. (SBU) Croatia,s Fishing and Environmental Protection Zone 
(FEPZ) will enter into force in the Adriatic Sea on October 
3.  It will not apply to EU member states, thanks to a 
political concession Croatia made in the run-up to a decision 
on its EU candidate status in June (ref A). Despite GoC 
efforts to decouple the FEPZ from the long-running maritime 
boundary dispute with Slovenia, the October 3 start date -- 
coincidentally also the date of Slovenian Parliamentary 
elections -- comes just as renewed tensions on the maritime 
boundary had begun to settle (ref B). 
 
2. (SBU) The FEPZ foreshadows how Adriatic fishing rights 
will be shared once Croatia joins the EU, as EU member states 
enjoy access to each other\'s fishing zones within negotiated 
quota limits, but neither the FEPZ nor EU accession will help 
solve the maritime boundary problem.  Unfortunately, the 
clear legal distinction between the FEPZ and the maritime 
boundary is lost on most reporters and more than a few 
politicians, making it likely that FEPZ enforcement could 
refuel anxieties on the maritime boundary just as cooler 
heads have begun to prevail. END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
FISHING ZONE TAKES EFFECT... BUT NOT FOR EU MEMBERS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3. (SBU) Croatia\'s Fishing and Environmental Protection Zone 
(FEPZ), which enters into force October 3, 2004, will not 
apply to EU-flagged vessels pending conclusion of a fisheries 
partnership agreement between Croatian and the EU. Under the 
FEPZ regime, Croatia will have authority only to interdict 
non-EU flag vessels fishing in the zone, which according to 
our MFA contacts includes a small number of mostly Korean and 
Japanese-flagged vessels. Italian vessels, the primary cause 
of over-fishing, will not be affected by the FEPZ. 
 
4. (SBU) However, Croatia currently has neither immediate 
plans nor capacity to enforce the FEPZ. Commenting on recent 
press reports that Croatia\'s nascent coast guard will ensure 
enforcement starting on October 3, MFA,s  Head of Department 
for EU Politics told Emboffs September 30 that the FEPZ would 
not be enforced for \"some months\" after its official start 
date. A special office of the PM will be created to oversee 
enforcement and must first establish clear rules of conduct 
before interdictions can begin. The FEPZ would in no way 
affect innocent passage or the safe passage of military 
vessels. The MFA legal department informed Emboffs the FEPZ 
was fully compliant with Croatia\'s treaty obligations under 
the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
 
5. (U) Croatia and Slovenia agreed in 1996 to allow limited 
fishing rights in each other,s territorial waters without 
fear of interdiction. In 2002, both Ministers of Interior 
agreed to a temporary but renewable suspension of 
interdiction of each other,s flagged vessels provided police 
were notified in advance. According to the MFA legal 
department, the GoS informed Croatia in early 2004 that it 
would not be able to renew this non-interdiction agreement 
after EU accession, as fisheries is an exclusive EU 
competence. 
 
6. (SBU) Since May 2004, local press has routinely reported 
on Slovenian police interdiction of Croatian-flagged vessels 
and police escorts for Croatian fishing vessels operating 
near the GoC-proposed maritime boundary, irking both sides 
but doing little to explain how fishing rights actually work. 
The MFA and Ministry of Interior are in close contact over 
each interdiction; MFA maintains a map showing logged 
incidents of Slovenian vessels in what are claimed to be 
Croatian territorial waters -- incidents effectively 
following the territo

SUBJECT: GOTOVINA SEARCH SEPTEMBER UPDATE 
 
Classified By: Poloff Justin Friedman, reasons 1.4 (b) & (d) 
 
1. (U) The ongoing GoC search for ICTY fugitive Ante Gotovina 
hit the Croatian news last week with the arrest of four 
persons suspected of being part of Gotovina\'s support network 
and the retirement of Gotovina\'s wife, Dunja Gotovina, from 
the Croatian Armed Forces.  Minister of Justice Vesna 
Skare-Ozbolt denied that the sensational raids on the Zagreb 
and Zadar homes of Zeljko Dilber, Ante Maksan, Zeljko 
Matozan, Zdenko Rincic were tied to her then upcoming visit 
to The Hague.  All four were released following questioning, 
but Dilber and Maksan will face illegal weapons possession 
charges resulting from evidence discovered during the raid. 
 
2. (C) Chief State Prosecutor Mladen Bajic - the GoC lead on 
the search for Gotovina - told us on September 28 that the 
timing of these raids was pure coincidence.  The request for 
search warrants on six individuals had been with the courts 
for several weeks before four were issued and the raids 
launched.  The two remaining requests were denied by the 
Sibenik court for insufficient grounds.  Bajic said that a 
joint police and intelligence service team was still 
analyzing data from computer and paper files recovered in the 
raid.  However, preliminary analysis seems to indicate that 
at least Dilber and Maksan had been in contact with Gotovina. 
 Bajic noted with satisfaction the improving coordination 
between police investigators and the Croatian POA (internal 
intelligence service).  A working group has been formed and 
is taking the lead in the investigation, freeing Bajic from 
having to have a more hands-on role in directing police 
activities. 
 
3. (C) Bajic holds out more hope for focusing current 
investigative efforts on Gotovina\'s wife, Dunja Gotovina. 
For the past seven years, Mrs. Gotovina has received a Lt. 
Colonel\'s salary from the Croatian army.  Last week the GoC 
announce the she will be retired from active duty by October 
15.  Bajic said that the investigation of Mrs. Gotovina\'s 
financial records was ongoing, but was key to tracing Ante 
Gotovina\'s support network.  Following reports of her 
traveling outside Croatia last spring, Mrs. Gotovina refused 
to show her passport to investigators.  Border police data do 
not indicate that she left the country, but Bajic has a 
search warrant request to look at her passport to try to 
determine her movements. 
 
4. (C) Bajic also said that he had followed up on information 
from the ICTY (which also splashed in the media) about 
Gotovina being seen in the seaside community of Brela near 
Makarska.  Bajic\'s mother lives in Brela and Bajic is a 
personal friend of the owner of the restaurant in which 
Gotovina was allegedly seen and photographed.  In a small, 
resort town with only one road (the Adriatic highway) and a 
narrow sea channel for entry or exit, it would be an unlikely 
stopover for Gotovina.  Bajic learned that the reports seemed 
to stem from an actor with a strong physical resemblence who 
had made himself up to look like Gotovina as part of a 
promotion for a film to be made with a Gotovina character.

PROGRESS, BUT BARRIERS REMAIN 
 
Classified By: Kirsten B. Selinger for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary and Comment 
 
1. (U) During his 29 SEP ) 2 OCT trip to Croatia, Assistant 
Secretary for PRM Arthur Dewey visited several refugee return 
 
SIPDIS 
sites - both trouble spots and successes - and heard that the 
barriers to additional returns include a lack of economic 
opportunity in the war-affected areas, bureaucratic hold-ups, 
lingering resistance to ethnic Serbs, and the existence of a 
&secret8 list of war-crimes indictments.  FM Zuzul 
emphasized the GOC,s intense commitment to concluding the 
refugee portfolio, noting that they were past &the point of 
no return8 on its resolution.  While many refugees have 
moved on and may no longer wish to return, the GOC wants and 
needs to close the returns chapter, facilitating return for 
those who wish to in a transparent manner.  As such, its 
upcoming public information campaign in Serbia and Montenegro 
(SAM) and Bosnia (BiH) will publicize its program for 
potential returnees who lost socialized housing ) the final 
and most difficult housing category.  Continued international 
pressure is needed, according to the OSCE, UNHCR and EU, in 
order to meet their goal of wrapping up the returns issue by 
the end of 2006. 
 
2. (C) Dewey met with ethnic Serb MP Milorad Pupovac, who 
praised  PM Sanader,s political commitment to reintegration 
and significant progress on housing for returnees, but noted 
that the PM,s message of reconciliation has still not 
trickled down to all members of his party and administration. 
 In the coming months, the ethnic Serb party (SDSS) will 
reevaluate its coalition with the GOC; concrete progress will 
be critical in maintaining their support, and recent comments 
indicate they are not fully pleased with developments.  End 
Summary and Comment. 
 
FM Zuzul: &Only One Way to Proceed8 
 
3. (U) The political commitment of the GOC was repeatedly 
underscored during the visit, most notably in a meeting with 
FM Miomir Zuzul.  The GOC has &made a decision that we want 
to solve8 the issues of refugee return and war criminals. 
The GOC knows there is only one way to proceed, Zuzul said, 
and that its chances for Euro-Atlantic integration hinge on 
these two issues, specifically resolving housing for returns 
and handing over fugitive General Gotovina to the ICTY. 
Since the HDZ took power the atmosphere for returns has 
changed significantly, Zuzul asserted.  We are proud of what 
has been achieved in less than a year, he said, noting that 
PM Sanader has twice visited ethnic Serb homes, the first PM 
to do so.  The GOC goal is to create the conditions for 
returns, including stimulating economic development.  In that 
regard, Zuzul asked Dewey for ideas to redevelop the 
economically-depressed war-affected areas. 
 
Ethnic Serb View: War Crimes Charges Are Continuing Barrier 
 
4. (C) PM Sanader,s genuine commitment was reaffirmed in 
Dewey,s meeting with Serbia and Montenegro Ambassador Milan 
Simurdic and Pupovac, although they noted that others have 
not jumped on board the PM,s reconciliation train.  In fact, 
some are standing in the way and are turning back the 
democratic process, Pupovac stated firmly.  Certain 
politicians will have to leave the GOC, he cautioned, or we 
will reconsider our coalition.  (Note: Pupovac is referring 
in part to unpopular and long-serving Assistant Minister for 
Displaced Persons and Refugees Lovre Pejkovic, who has been 
repeatedly criticized for inaction and obstruction of the 
returns process on many fronts.  End Note.) In recent days, 
Pupovac has spoken out publicly about the lack of practical 
support for returns, calling administrative barriers and 
policy inconsistencies an alternate form of ethnic cleansing. 
 
5. (C) Of serious concern to both is the alleged &secret 
list8 of persons accused of war crimes, which has taken on 
mythic proportions within the refugee community.  Pupovac and 
Simurdic agreed that fear of arrest remains the major 
deterrent to additional returns to Croatia.  The Chief State 
Prosecutor is finalizing a review of all ongoing war crimes 
investigations with the goal of eliminating unfounded 
 
 
accusations.  He has promised a comprehensive list of the 
remaining cases (about 1,900) to Pupovac in the coming weeks. 
 While only a few returnees per month are arrested and most 
are quickly released, Pupovac said that news of any arrest 
has a chilling effect on refugee return as it spreads via 
word of mouth in refugee communities.  Pupovac intends to 
approach Sanader on this issue, and said receipt of an 
accurate list will play into his party,s further 
participation in the coalition, hinting at an internal review 
by the end of this year. 
 
6. (SBU) Simurdic praised the positive approach of the GOC, 
but complained that they have not established a permanent 
dialogue with the GOS.  For example, he was not invited to 
the launch of the GOC/OSCE/UNHCR/EU public information 
campaign to encourage refugee returns, targeted predominantly 
at individuals currently living in Serbia and Montenegro. 
The GOC is using the ethnic Serb SDSS as a substitute for 
dialogue with the GOS, he said.  In Dewey,s meeting with 
Zuzul, the FM had admitted its failure in communicating with 
Belgrade, attributing it to Belgrade,s lack of organization 
and clear representative. 
 
Field Visits: Barriers Remain, Progress Slow 
 
7. (U) In numerous visits to returnee families, and to civil 
society organizations that assist refugee returns, A/S Dewey 
saw GOC-funded settlements for Bosnian Croats and property 
repossession sites of Croatian Serbs.  However, looting of 
Serb properties (mainly by Croats who occupied the properties 
after the war) remains a practical barrier to habitation. 
Many potential returnees, according to several NGOs, are also 
deterred by a lack implementation of laws at the national and 
local levels, minimal access to GOC funding for returns, and 
bureaucratic obstruction.

MARITIME BOUNDARY 
 
REF: (A) ZAGREB 1737 (B) ZAGREB 1741 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. (SBU) Croatia remains open to a negotiated bilateral 
settlement on the Croatia-Slovenia maritime boundary despite 
press reports to the contrary. A much-hyped Slovenian 
proposal to avoid fishing incidents in the Adriatic has not 
yet been presented to the GoC. Two weeks after Slovenian 
parliamentary elections, the maritime boundary issue is still 
very much alive; if Croatia is unable to conclude bilateral 
negotiations with Slovenia on the border, it will press for 
international arbitration. END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
NEGOTIATIONS STILL POSSIBLE 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) On October 14, Croatian MFA Director for Central 
Europe and Head of the International Law Department told 
Emboffs that the GoC was still open to a negotiated bilateral 
settlement on the open maritime boundary question with 
Slovenia. If a negotiated agreement proves impossible, the 
GoC is prepared to submit to binding arbitration (reftel A). 
MFA lawyers have not started to prepare their case to present 
before an arbitration court, though they have begun 
collecting relevant documents. 
 
3. (SBU) Our MFA contacts\' statements contradict an October 
15 press report that FM Zuzul\'s formation of a special team 
to handle arbitration meant that Croatia had ruled out a 
bilateral agreement. Our MFA contacts had not heard of any 
such arbitration team. 
 
4. (SBU) Croatian and Slovenian media reported that Slovenia 
would present the Croatian MFA with an \"Agreement on the 
Avoidance of Incidents\" in the disputed territorial waters of 
the northern Adriatic. On September 30 -- the day Slovenian 
FM Ivo Vajgl announced Slovenia would present its proposal -- 
the Head of EU Politics at the Croatian MFA told us he had 
heard of the proposal only from the newspapers and that he 
had no meetings scheduled with the Slovenian Embassy in 
Zagreb. At the October 14 meeting, our MFA contacts confirmed 
that they have not/not received such agreement from the GoS. 
 
5. (SBU) Our MFA contacts stressed that Croatia will not use 
its recently-proclaimed Fishing and Environmental Protection 
Zone (FEPZ) to press its case on the maritime boundary 
(reftel B). The FEPZ and maritime boundary are completely 
separate questions, although the media and even some GoC 
officials have employed rhetoric equating the FEPZ with 
territorial expansion. The FEPZ lies well south of the 
disputed area.

SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTATION OF IP MOU STALLS: EC NOT THE 
REASON, BUT A GOOD EXCUSE 
 
REF:  ZAGREB 387 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
-------------------- 
 
1.  (SBU) The GOC has not yet taken action on legislative 
changes need to implement and bring into force the 
Intellectual Property MOU, finally ratified in March, 
despite Ministerial-level reassurances in September. 
European Commission officials have raised open-ended 
questions about the MOU in meetings with GOC officials, 
but EU ambivalence is not why its implementation has 
stalled.  Rather, our allies, notably in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, have to push for the MOU over the 
objections of a strong Minister of Health and a strong 
domestic lobby.  Once the EU gets data exclusivity 
protection -- required by its Interim Agreement with 
Croatia and also a small but important part of the MOU -- 
- and as Croatia begins negotiations on accession early 
in 2005, we expect EU griping about the MOU to become 
even louder.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
Amendments Blocked 
------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) The Ambassador has repeatedly pressed the 
government -- most recently in mid-September -- to move 
forward two pieces of legislation to enable the 1998 MOU 
to come into force: one amends the drug law to provide 
data exclusivity and the other amends the patent law to 
provide \"pipeline protection\" (a one-year window in 
which companies can file for patents on products not yet 
on the market but which are past the usual period for 
filing).  Two ministers assured the Ambassador that one 
or both pieces of legislation would be on the 
government\'s agenda before the end of September.  In 
several government sessions held since then, however, 
the issue was not considered. 
 
3.  (SBU) Government and industry contacts report that 
the local generics industry and the Minister of Health 
(and Deputy Prime Minister for Economy) Andrija Hebrang 
oppose the MOU.   Hebrang is wrestling with an enormous 
budget gap in the public health system, and the U.S. 
industry believes he extracted large pricing concessions 
from local generics manufacturers in partial exchange 
for delaying the introduction of data exclusivity.  In 
the meantime, our industry informs us that a bumper crop 
of marketing requests for locally-produced generics, 
which rely on U.S. test data for registration, are being 
approved and the copied drugs are being put on the drug 
reimbursement list. 
 
EC Innocent... Sort Of 
---------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) In late September, Globus (a sensationalist but 
occasionally accurate weekly) published a titillatingly 
titled article, \"Barroso and Sanader in Conflict Over 
Viagra.\"  The article claimed that the European 
Commission had written to PM Sanader opposing the MOU. 
The EC Delegation confirmed that no such letter existed. 
In fact, the EC had recently reminded the Minister of 
European Integration of the need to get cracking on data 
exclusivity, and complaining of long drug registration 
periods.  However, our EC counterpart told us that the EC 
\"was not overjoyed with the prospect of the MOU.\" She did 
not provide an explanation other than exasperation that 
Croatia did not discuss or share the MOU with the 
Commission before it was ratified.\" 
 
5.  (SBU) The MFA has confirmed that the EC Delegation 
had recently made informal remarks in meetings with GOC 
officials indicating \"serious questions\" about the MOU. 
Head of the North America Desk at the MFA -- a supporter 
of the MOU -- said, \"Frankly, these comments make our job 
harder.  Some clarity would be appreciated.\" 
 
6.  (SBU) Econoff met with visiting EC staffers on 
October 18,including Alain Deckers from the Commission\'s 
Internal Market DG.  The officials said that they had no 
objections to the two pieces of legislation as long as 
they were non-discriminatory and did not prevent Croatia 
meeting its obligations under the Interim Agreement.  We 
shared frustration that the Ministry of Health was 
telling each of us that the other was an obstacle to 
devising data exclusivity language. 
 
7.  (SBU) Deckers did note that Croatia would have to 
 
 
\"denounce\" some parts of the MOU upon EU entry, for 
procedural rather than substantive reasons.  Other parts 
of the MOU, notably in the copyright area, might not 
conform to EU Directives, but he was not able to give 
details.  The Commission\'s Croatia Desk Officer went 
further, saying that he was sure that the U.S. would not 
want to do anything to complicate Croatia\'s accession and 
implying that the MOU could cause problems.  Econoff 
asserted that bringing the MOU into effect was not 
negotiable and noted that the mixed signals being sent 
about the MOU were being used by those who wanted to 
block data exclusivity and pipeline protection, which 
hurts us both.

SUBJECT: HDZ PICKS KOSOR, \"DIGNIFIED\" CAMPAIGN AHEAD 
 
REF: A. ZAGREB 01601 
     B. ZAGREB 01571 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: The ruling Croatian Democratic 
Union (HDZ) announced on 17 October its nomination of 
Jadranka Kosor, Deputy PM and Minister of Family, 
Generational Solidarity and Veterans\' Affairs (bio follows) 
as candidate for the presidential elections (ref A) currently 
planned for Tuesday, December 21.  This choice reflects the 
party\'s desire to select a safe candidate -- i.e. one who can 
lose gracefully to the overwhelmingly popular incumbent 
President Stjepan Mesic and minimize the damage this loss 
inflicts on the HDZ heading into local elections expected in 
May 2005 (ref B). 
 
2. (U) By law, the government must schedule elections on 
non-working days, so discussion of a midweek vote has sparked 
complaints from the business community about lost revenue 
from another shutdown in late December.  Speaker of 
Parliament Vladimir Seks has said the government may avoid 
the workday issue and call the election for Sunday, January 
2, 2005.  PM Sanader is now floating a proposal for a 
constitutional amendment allowing presidential elections on 
the same Sunday every five years, rather than the current 
window between 30 and 60 days prior to the end of the 
incumbent\'s mandate.  The opposition Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) has expressed opposition to reopening a constitutional 
debate.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
LOW EXPECTATIONS, HIGH RHETORIC 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) While the HDZ has promised to do all it can to 
ensure Kosor\'s victory, the party will likely avoid harsh 
criticism of the president, given his reputation as Croatia\'s 
most popular politician.  The HDZ would prefer to maintain 
its good relations with Mesic and just get the election over 
with (December 21 is the earliest electoral date under the 
Constitution, putting the greatest possible amount of time 
between this and the May local elections); so Kosor\'s 
campaign will likely remain in her words \"dignified\" and 
\"peaceful.\" 
 
4. (U) Analysts believe Kosor can count on core HDZ voters 
(about 30% in the last elections), but will lose centrist 
voters to Mesic, who has the support of at least seven 
opposition parties, and more extreme right wing voters to 
Slaven Letica of the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP).  Other 
candidates include the far right Croatian Block\'s president 
Ivic Pasalic, a close associate of former president Franjo 
Tudjman, and Miroslav \"Ciro\" Blazevic, whose political 
reputation rests largely on his coaching of the Croatian 
national soccer team to a third place World Cup finish in 
1998.  This opposition may not be sufficient to push the 
election to a second round (held two weeks after the first 
round), as Mesic\'s current poll numbers are well over the 
required 50 percent. 
 
5. (U) Kosor has already made her first misstep of the 
campaign: when she claimed she already had the support of a 
Croatian network of 40 women\'s NGOs, NGO leaders publicly 
denied the assertion, reporting they are still waiting to 
hear Kosor\'s positions on key issues.  She is the second 
woman to run for president in Croatia\'s history. 
 
BIOGRAPHY: WARTIME RADIO BROADCASTS BUILT PUBLIC FOLLOWING 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
6.  (U) Kosor was born on July 1, 1953, in the Slavonian town 
of Pakrac.  She began her professional career as a journalist 
in 1972, working for the daily newspaper Vecernji List and 
Radio Zagreb (now Croatian Radio).  During the 1991-95 war, 
she hosted radio shows for refugees and other displaced 
persons, earning her name recognition and public popularity. 
In 1995 she became one of the HDZ\'s vice presidents, was 
elected to parliament, and became deputy speaker.  In 2002, 
she became deputy president of the HDZ, making her officially 
the number two in the party.  She was elected to a third term 
in parliament in 2003 but gave up her seat to take her 
current cabinet position.  In recent years, she has focused 
her political energies on issues related to motherhood and 
war veterans.  Kosor holds a law degree from the Law Faculty 
in Zagreb.  She has one son and lives in Zagreb.  She speaks 
some English and understands German.

SUBJECT: BUSINESS AS \"ZUZUL\" - FM FACES CORRUPTION SCANDAL 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Opposition parliamentarians today 
filed a motion for a vote of no-confidence in Foreign 
Minister Miomir Zuzul after a week of swirling corruption 
accusations.  Zuzul has denied all wrongdoing in the business 
deal at the center of the controversy, but the chief state 
prosecutor has launched an investigation and PM Ivo Sanader 
has backed off from earlier unconditional support for his FM, 
saying he is \"awaiting the facts.\"  While those facts remain 
murky, it is clear that attacks on Zuzul are taking a 
political toll.  With opposition claims that the Serb and 
Pensioner parties from the ruling coalition will join the 
hunt for Zuzul, Sanader may soon find the scandal too costly 
for the GoC and seek the FM\'s resignation himself. 
 
2.  (C) Zuzul has been a consistent friend of the U.S. and 
his experience as Croatian Ambassador to the U.S. has 
naturally made him one of Post\'s key interlocutors within the 
GoC.  Zuzul\'s pro-American views, however, have become a 
liability in the press, and his perceived inability to keep 
his business deals separate from his official duties will 
likely make him an increasingly ineffective advocate for U.S. 
interests.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
THE IMOSTROJ/MTS CASE ) CONFLICT OF INTEREST? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The current scandal revolves around the sale of two 
companies: Imostroj, a bankrupt arms manufacturer whose 
assets were purchased by businessman and Zuzul relative Ivan 
Karin at auction in June, and MTS, a consultancy company 
owned by FM Zuzul\'s wife.  Zuzul\'s accusers claim that after 
Karin agreed to purchase 50 percent of MTS for 500,000 kuna 
(approximately USD 80,000), the FM influenced the GoC\'s 
September decision to write off a substantial portion of 
Imostroj\'s debt.  While Zuzul has denied any connection 
between the deals, his credibility dropped when the press 
immediately disproved his claims that Karin never actually 
paid for his share of MTS.  The GoC has defended the debt 
write off as a simple social measure to allow employees to 
receive their salaries. 
 
4. (SBU) Zuzul has been dogged by negative press stories 
since becoming FM late last year, and his efforts to defend 
himself have become increasingly awkward.  When the press 
discovered he had under-declared rental income, Zuzul blamed 
his accountant.  When the press lambasted him for his 
vociferous arguments for contracting directly with Bechtel 
for a new segment of the Split-Dubrovnik road, Zuzul, who had 
worked until a few months before the November 2003 elections 
for a law firm which lobbied for Bechtel, claimed the Foreign 
Minister played a natural role in all large international 
deals.  After Sanader was pressured into nixing the direct 
contract and putting the roadwork out for bid, Zuzul\'s 
perceived conflict of interest became an article of faith 
among many in the press and public. 
 
OPPOSITION SMELLS BLOOD, RULING PARTY ASSESSING DAMAGE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5. (U) Leaders from the opposition Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), and Croatian People\'s 
Party (HNS) claim they can muster 79 votes in a no-confidence 
measure against Zuzul (two more than the required simple 
majority), including votes from the Croatian Party of 
Pensioners (HSU) and the Independent Serbian Democratic Party 
(SDSS) of the ruling coalition.  According to current 
parliamentary rules, the Speaker must call the no-confidence 
vote within 30 days of a request.  The presidency of 
Sanader\'s Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) will m

NON-MILITARY ASSISTANCE IN IRAQ 
 
REF: ZAGREB 01936 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d). 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: As she did in her meetings with 
President Stjepan Mesic and PM Ivo Sanader (septel), A/S Beth 
Jones stressed the importance of Croatia\'s role in NATO 
integration and stability in the region when she met November 
11 with Social Democratic Party (SDP) president Ivica Racan. 
A/S Jones also asked for opposition support of an Article 98 
agreement and Croatia\'s expanded involvement in international 
military actions, explaining that our bilateral relationship 
will grow as Croatia participates more in multilateral 
actions.  She highlighted actions Croatia could undertake to 
remove barriers to Euro-Atlantic integration, such as the 
capture of ICTY fugitive Ante Gotovina. 
 
2. (C) The former prime minister said the SDP supports strong 
U.S.-Croatia relations whether the party is in government or 
in the opposition.  Racan expressed worry about the ruling 
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) government\'s handling of the 
EU integration agenda.  He said he would consider ways the 
SDP as the largest opposition party could contribute to 
improving relations with the U.S., but stopped short of 
endorsing Article 98 or troops to Iraq.  END SUMMARY AND 
COMMENT. 
 
ASSISTING IN IRAQ, BUT WITHOUT COMBAT BOOTS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Racan defended Croatia\'s role in the GWOT, 
particularly during the SDP coalition government (in power 
from 2000-2003), when Croatia decided to send troops to 
support operations in Afghanistan even before the U.S. asked. 
 When he mentioned Croatia signing the Vilnius statement, he 
motioned toward his then-FM, Tonino Picula, sitting at his 
side.  \"This is the Foreign Minister who was almost hung,\" he 
said.  According to Racan, the Vilnius statement sparked a 
fierce public reaction that his government underestimated, as 
Croatians still recovering from war spoke out against sending 
troops outside their country\'s borders. 
 
4. (C) The SDP supports non-military assistance to the effort 
in Iraq, according to Racan, and his government considered 
some options a year ago.  While he didn\'t directly oppose 
contributing forces under UNSCR 1546 for UN security during 
election preparations, he said he could not foresee a 
decision in which Croatian troops would go to Iraq.  On 
Article 98, Racan noted that during his government, the 
opposition (the now-ruling Croatian Democratic Union - HDZ) 
linked the issue to the ICTY, supporting an Article 98 
agreement with the U.S. as justification for their opposition 
to cooperation with the ICTY. 
 
INTEGRATION, PUBLIC OPINION, AND THE HDZ GOVERNMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (C) Racan said he was worried about the dramatic drop in 
public support for EU and NATO membership (now both below 50 
percent) since the HDZ took power in December 2003, saying it 
could seriously limit the GoC\'s maneuvering room in EU 
negotiations.  He attributed the dip to the HDZ\'s tendency to 
blame every tough decision on international pressure rather 
than presenting reforms as in Croatia\'s interest.  He claimed 
this is the price the country pays for a HDZ government 
pursuing policies that its voter base does not support.  Next 
week, the opposition will propose a set of principles in 
Parliament that Croatia should stand on in EU negotiations, 
as the GoC has not put forward any. 
 
6. (C) According to Racan, internal HDZ opposition to reform 
has kept the Sanader government from advancing reform 
legislation.  He also cited the conflict-of-interest scandal 
surrounding FM Miomir Zuzul (reftel) as damaging to Croatian 
credibility within the EU. 
 
\"IT\'S GOOD TO BE THE OPPOSITION\" 
-------------------------------- 
7. (C) COMMENT: Racan and his party seem content to sit back 
and let the HDZ pursue essentially the same pro-EU/NATO 
agenda the SDP government pursued.  According to Racan, the 
current government\'s work on integration has helped temper 
European skepticism about the HDZ and Croatia in general. 
And while SDP strategists fear the HDZ government will leave 
important reforms left undone, some issues, such as

OFF TO SLOW START 
 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
1.  (SBU) Despite public statements that Croatia is ready to 
start and conclude EU membership negotiations, a lack of 
coordination has characterized the beginning of the process. 
The GoC has delayed naming its negotiating team until it 
receives a date to open negotiations.  Though including NGOs 
and unions in the negotiating process might help bolster 
flagging support for accession, union leaders doubt they will 
be welcome as real participants in the negotiating process. 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
 
LOTS OF BROTH, NOT ENOUGH COOKS 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) PM Sanader has publicly backed away from early 
promises to \"catch up\" to Romania and Bulgaria, instead 
pledging to start negotiations in early 2005 and close all 
acquis chapters within two years.  Yet despite the PM\'s 
request for a concrete start date at the December 17 EU 
Ministerial, a lack of coordination within the GoC on the 
negotiating process could lengthen the process.  Thus far the 
PM has named only the delegation heads -- FM Zuzul and 
Minister of European Integration Grabar-Kitarovic. 
 
3.  (SBU) According to the MFA, the GoC will delay setting up 
the rest of negotiating team until after the December 
meeting.   There will be a separate negotiating team for each 
acquis chapter; the composition of each team will depend on 
the acquis chapter, though both the MFA and the Ministry of 
European Integration (MEI) will be represented.  The MFA will 
negotiate the Common Foreign and Security Policy chapter and 
share responsibility for the external assistance chapter with 
the Ministry of Economy. 
 
LABOR UNIONS HAVE THEIR DOUBTS 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) The government has promised to make negotiations a 
non-partisan affair including all parties, unions, NGOs, and 
companies, but has yet to send out formal invitations. 
Croatia\'s largest labor union, the Federation of Independent 
Trade Unions (SSSH), expressed doubts to Emboffs that the 
government would seriously welcome their input on negotiating 
teams.  SSSH is eager and willing to participate in 
negotiating teams for acquis chapters that concern labor 
issues.  Though SSSH strongly supports EU membership, it 
fears the GoC will try to close chapters as quickly as 
possible rather than negotiate a good deal for Croatia. 
(COMMENT:  The SSSH may overestimate how much actual 
negotiating there will be, to judge from the experience of 
recent EU candidate countries similar to Croatia.) 
 
5.  (SBU) In exchange for inclusion in the negotiating 
process, SSSH is prepared to mobilize its 215,000-member base 
in a pro-EU campaign but feels the GoC doesn\'t take its offer 
seriously.  As public support for EU membership dips below 50 
percent -- and a referendum seems likely -- the GoC knows it 
will need to engage the public in the process.  Union leaders 
and MFA officials agree that a fringe euro-skeptic campaign 
has met with some success only because the GoC has yet to 
mount a serious pro-EU challenge.

REGION, AFGHANISTAN; URGES ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) During their November 11 meeting, A/S Beth Jones 
and Prime Minister Sanader discussed steps to improve 
regional relations, current and possibly additional Croatian 
contributions to resolve international crises, and the 
possibility of signing an Article 98 Agreement.  PM Sanader 
stressed that while 
Croatia was looking toward the EU, it was mindful of its 
responsibilities in the region.  A/S Jones congratulated 
Croatia on its progress toward regional cooperation and 
Euro-Atlantic integration, while calling for greater Croatian 
contributions to resolve international conflicts.  In her 
meeting with President Mesic November 10, A/S Jones urged 
Croatia to support UN activities in Iraq. 
 
Regional Cooperation 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) PM Sanader said he would visit Belgrade the 
following week -- the first visit of a Croatian Prime 
Minister to Belgrade ever.  Cooperation of Serbian 
authorities in helping locate 1200 Croatians missing since 
the war would help close a painful chapter in history.  SaM, 
BiH and Croatia were developing common methodologies and a 
common register of missing persons.  Looking to the future, 
he and his counterpart would initial the first bilateral 
agreement on minority protection.  PM Sanader stressed the 
parliamentary support of all minority representatives -- 
including the Serbs -- for his government. 
 
3.  (C) PM Sanader appealed for a strong continued U.S. 
presence in the region.  He noted that Croatia\'s positive 
steps toward EU accession and NATO integration were 
incentives for the whole region.  PM Sanader recommended 
against broadening the Adriatic Charter (A3) to include BiH 
and Serbia-Montenegro.  The addition of weaker partners, who 
were not yet even members of Partnership for Peace, would 
slow the A3\'s momentum and stir negative public reaction in 
the three countries. 
 
4.  (SBU) A/S Jones reassured the Prime Minister of the U.S. 
continued commitment to the region, stressing that NATO would 
remain in BiH in a smaller, more focused manner, and that 
EU-FOR would liaise with NATO.  The Adriatic Charter was 
about encouraging each other, but NATO would make the 
determination on whom to invite on an individual basis.  When 
A3 reached out to BiH and SaM, it was welcomed as sign of 
strong leadership. 
 
ICTY Cooperation 
---------------- 
 
5.  (C) PM Sanader noted stepped-up cooperation with ICTY -- 
most recently GoC involvement that resulted in the voluntary 
surrender in BiH of indictee Miroslav Bralo, a Bosnian Croat. 
 A/S Jones welcomed the recent cooperation, noting that the 
arrest of fugitive General Gotovina would be essential to 
Croatia\'s Euro-Atlantic integration.  President Mesic made 
similar comments to A/S Jones, noting that full ICTY 
cooperation is in Croatia\'s national interest. 
 
Afghanistan/Iraq 
---------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) A/S Jones thanked PM Sanader for Croatia\'s sending 
of troops to Afghanistan, which contributed to the historic 
elections there.  The U.S. was seeking international 
community support in Iraq as well -- the EU and member states 
were quite involved in reconstruction and humanitarian 
assistance.  There was a new focus on working through the UN, 
as elections neared.  We would like to see Croatian 
contribute in some way to a UN Protection Force.  In general, 
we welcomed greater Croatian involvement in any of the crisis 
areas around the world -- Iraq, Afghanistan, Darfur, or 
others. 
 
7.  (C) PM Sanader noted that he had publicly supported the 
U.S. intervention in Iraq before the election, but the 
requirement for a two-thirds vote in the parliament to send 
troops abroad made an Iraq deployment impossible. 
Additionally, there were presidential elections in January 
and local elections in April that made the topic difficult 
even to consider. 
 
8. (C) President Mesic said Croatian military contributions 
to the UN-Iraq mission were possible \"under the right 
conditions.\"  President Mesic said that Croatia was 
\"maximally cooperating\" in the anti-terrorist coalition, but 
he was deeply concerned about the devastating fall out for 
Croatia\'s vital tourism industry from a possible terrorist 
 
 
attack.  He observed that the Israel-Palestine problem was 
the main generator of terrorism and the key ultimately to 
resolving both Afghanistan and Iraq.  Noting the opportunity 
created by the passing of Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat, 
President Mesic urged the U.S. to take the lead in 
reinvigorating the Middle East Peace Process.  He welcomed 
the upcoming Morocco initiative but suggested that the key to 
winning the war on terrorism would be to have prominent 
Muslim clerics unequivocally condemn all terrorist acts. 
 
Article 98 
---------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Similarly, on the possibility of an Article 98 
agreement, PM Sanader recalled his public comments urging 
consideration for the U.S. position.  The EU had made clear, 
however, that no accession hopeful could sign such an 
agreement.  If the EU position changed, Croatia would be 
happy to reconsider. 
 
10.  (U) Assistant Secretary Jones has cleared this message.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MESIC KICKS UP DUST ON EUCOM MEMORANDUM 
OF UNDERSTANDING 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Justin Friedman, reasons 1.4 (b) & (d) 
 
1. (C) President Mesic has kicked up some political dust 
over the EUCOM Memorandum of Understanding (signed in July) 
on using Croatian facilities and airspace for bilateral 
military 
exercises.  Without objecting to the substance of the MoU, 
Mesic\'s office has asserted publicly that it was not 
informed about the MoU until it came up for Sabor 
ratification late last week.  Our understanding is that 
lead negotiator Assistant Minister of Defense for Policy 
Jelena Grcic-Polic was keeping Mesic\'s office in the loop. 
However, it is possible that in the finalization of the MoU 
text, the internal clearance process inside the GoC may 
have fallen short of the spirit, if not necessarily the 
letter of the regulations.  Mesic may be trying to use 
the uproar to throw some dirt on the ruling HDZ party and, 
indirectly, on HDZ Presidential candidate Jadranka Kosor. 
Parliamentary ratification of the standard agreement is not 
seriously in doubt.  END SUMMARY and COMMENT. 
 
NOT IN THE LOOP? 
---------------- 
 
2. (SBU) President Mesic\'s office touched off a small 
political dust storm with the public assertion over the 
weekend that his office was not consulted before the 
Ministry of Defense signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
with EUCOM over the use of Croatian facilities and airspace 
for military exercises.  On national television news on 
November 16, Mesic positioned himself above the fray, 
saying that he would have his staff review the MoU and the 
process leading up to its signing, but would not interfere 
in the Parliamenary ratification process if legal procedures 
had been followed. 
 
3. (C) Assitant Military Advisor to President Mesic, Maj. 
Robert Baric, confirmed for us the press reports that the 
President\'s office believes it was not fully consulted in 
the run up to the MoU signing. 
 
WHO IS THE TARGET? 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) Press reports have focused on the fact that the MoU 
was signed by Grcic-Polic.  Although Grcic-Polic was a key 
MoD office official in the previous coalition government, 
she is one of the few senior officials to stay in 
government when the HDZ assumed power last winter and may 
be perceived as too pro-U.S.  Our experience with 
Grcic-Polic is that she is a tough negotiator and an 
effective, if prickly advocate for Croatian interests.  We 
have heard rumors of Grcic-Polic\'s departure from the MoD 
since this summer when she was short-listed to be Croatia\'s 
Ambassador to Brussels.  However, President Mesic appeared 
to have nixed her nomination.  In the end, Grcic-Polic may 
be just collateral damage as she is seen as close to 
Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul, in part from her previous 
diplomatic service. 
 
5. (C) Mesic\'s real target may be the HDZ and its 
presidential candidate, Jadranka Kosor.  Some press 
commentators have picked up on this tiff as further 
evidence that the HDZ is too eager to kowtow to the U.S. as 
compensation for not delivering on pre-election promises of 
sending troops to Iraq or an Article 98 agreement.  In the 
last week, Mesic has dropped his non-party, 
president-of-the-people stance and alligned himself with 
the SDP, HSS, and LIBRA opposition parties, as well as with 
his own former party, the HNS.  Mesic is still polling 
above 50% with Kosor trailing far behind in second place 
with just 20% support. 
 
RATIFICATION STILL SEEMS LIKELY 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) On substance, the MoU is a standard, 
non-controversial document.  In a press conference November 
16, former Defense Minister and opposition MP Zelka 
Antunovic only questioned the fact that the MoU had not 
been made public although it is not confidential. 
Pointedly, Antunovic did not challenge the substance or 
need for the MoU.  This current dust up may slow 
ratification of the MoU, but MoD sources indicate ratification 
is not in jeopardy.

DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT OF U.S. DRUG FIRMS 
 
(SBU) On November 8, the Ambassador met with Minister of 
European Integration, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, to discuss 
implementation of the Intellectual Property MOU.  Kitarovic 
explained that an amendment to the Drug Law was being 
considered which would provide the U.S. and the EU different 
periods of data exclusivity.  The Ambassador strongly 
objected, saying that discriminatory treatment was 
unacceptable, and a very bad signal to foreign investors. 
Kitarovic admitted this treatment was problematic under 
Croatian law as well, and pledged to do her best to rectify 
the situation.  Kitarovic later informed the Ambassador that 
she had succeeded in ensuring that a non-discriminatory 
version of the amendment would be considered.  While the 
final language of the provision is still being discussed, the 
GoC now understands that we will not tolerate differential 
treatment.

SUBJECT: SANADER\'S BELGRADE VISIT HAILED AS HISTORIC, 
COURAGEOUS 
 
 
Classified By: Political Officer Tom Selinger for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d) 
. 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Politicians and analysts from 
across nearly the entire political spectrum have praised PM 
Ivo Sanader\'s November 15 visit to Belgrade and his meetings 
with SAM President Svetozar Marovic and PM Vojislav Kostunica 
as a key step forward in post-war reconciliation.  According 
to the MFA, concrete results from this visit include an 
agreement on the protection of minority rights (septel) and a 
joint statement recognizing the two countrie\' shared goal of 
Euro-Atlantic integration and highlighting the importance of 
regional cooperation.  In Croatian political circles, the 
substance of the trip is far outweighed by the magnitude of 
the visit itself, the first of a Croatian head of government 
to the SAM capital. 
 
2. (C) The visit is also a reassuring sign of Sanader\'s 
control over the right wing of his party, particularly in the 
run-up to presidential elections expected in early January. 
The PM continues to succeed in his pro-integration and 
pro-reconciliation foreign policy, keeping the ruling 
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) squarely in line with the 
expectations of the international community.  Only the far 
right Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) opposed the Belgrade 
trip, saying it was poorly timed, three days before the 
anniversary of the fall of Vukovar.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
 
DOCUMENTS HIGHLIGHT COMMON EUROPEAN GOALS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) In a now familiar refrain, Damir Kusen, Assistant 
Minister in the MFA for EU, NATO and member states, told the 
DCM that both sides were committed to addressing their 
differences in a \"European spirit.\"  Kusen said during the 
visit the GoC announced its intention to withdraw all 
military forces from along the SAM border by the end of 2004, 
and hoped their neighbors would reciprocate.  The GoC will 
also extend its visa exemption for SAM citizens by 6 months, 
with the possibility of making the policy permanent 
(presumably after the border is completely de-militarized). 
SAM\'s deliverables, according to Kusen, included support for 
Croatia\'s bid for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security 
Council, and the return of land registries and books from a 
monastic library taken by the JNA during the war.  The GoC 
hopes to focus an expected Kostunica visit to Zagreb in the 
spring on trade and economic cooperation. 
 
4.  (U) Minority issues dominated much of the visit.  MOJ 
Vesna Skare-Ozbolt signed an agreement on the protection of 
national minorities with the SAM Minister of Human and 
Minority Rights Rasim Ljajic.  Kusen emphasized that the GoC 
sees the final phase of refugee returns as a bilateral issue 
with SAM, and hopes to speed up the resolution of missing 
persons cases.  Kusen noted that the GoC\'s budgetary 
challenges will temporarily delay resolution of the return of 
property to Serbs, but said SAM officials understand this. 
Several days before the Belgrade visit, according to Kusen, 
the GoC provided the Serbian government with a 
much-publicized list of war crimes indictments (a version of 
which has since appeared on the internet) in an effort to 
address concerns that fear of arrest prevents some Serb 
refugees from returning. 
 
MINORITIES AND OPPOSITION AGREE ON SIGNIFICANCE OF VISIT 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
5. (C) SAM Ambassador to Croatia Milan Simurdic, who 
accompanied Sanader on the entire Belgrade visit, called it 
truly historic.  He told the DCM that the Serb minority in 
Croatia was very satisfied with Sanader\'s decision to make 
the trip and he viewed it as very productive. 
 
6. (C) Furio Radin, an Italian minority MP who chairs the 
Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights and Rights of 
National Minorities, told PolOff that PM\'s visit was 
\"necessary and courageous, particularly just before the 
presidential elections.\"  Radin praised Sanader\'s foreign 
policy, calling it the best part of the current government. 
He noted that the real proof of the PM\'s success was his 
support among minority MPs, and all have praised his Belgrade 
visit. 
 
7.  (C) Professor Damir Grubisa, a left-wing political 
scientist who left the Tudjman government in protest over its 
expansionist policy toward Bosnia, said the visit shows that 
Croatia and SAM are pushing the war into the past.  Grubisa, 
who does not often agree with the PM, called Sanader a 
\"shrewd statesman,\" and commended his \"business-like 
approach\" to regional relations.  The Belgrade visit, Grubisa 
told PolOff, showed real leadership on Sanader\'s part and 
 
 
will open a dialogue that will make all future cooperation 
easier.

SUBJECT: CROATIA: TRANSPARENCY OF BUDGETS/MILITARY SPENDING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 239929 
 
1.  In response to reftel, post provides the following, keyed 
to reftel questions: 
 
A.  General Overview of Auditing Procedures: 
 
(1) - According to the MOD, military expenditures are audited 
in various ways.  Commanders, heads of units and the 
Financial Section of the MOD are responsible for monitoring 
the budgets.  There is an internal MOD auditor (the 
Department for Programs, Budgets and Finance), and an 
external auditor -- the State Audit Agency, which examines 
financial reports annually.  There is also an Inspector 
General within the MOD for ad hoc investigations. 
 
(2) As noted above, there are both internal MOD and external 
audits. 
 
(3) The Inspector General reports to the Ministry of Defense; 
the State Audit Agency reports to the Parliament. 
 
(4) Most of the people to whom the auditors report are 
civilians (most of the top ranking people in the MOD are 
civilian). 
 
(5) There is a legislative framework for annual audits of 
military expenditures. 
 
(6) The Law on State Auditing requires annual audits of 
receipts that fund the military. 
 
--  Post knows of no recent scandals involving military 
expenditures (there were serious problems in the MOD in the 
\'90s).  The local press has been active in uncovering 
procurement \"scandals\" in the Ministries of Health and 
Transportaion, but has not reported on any financial scandals 
in the MOD or military services in recent years. 
Approximately seventy percent of the military\'s budget is for 
personnel expenses, very little for procurement.  Budgeting 
and monitoring of budgeting are still developing in Croatia 
(departments and ministries routinely over- and under-spend 
their budgets), but we know of no major current cases of 
abuses or fraud in the MOD. 
 
B.  Military Budget and On-Budget and Off-Budget Revenues and 
Expenses 
 
(1) The Defense Budget includes the armed forces; the 
intelligence and internal security forces are covered by 
other budget items (\"security forces\" includes only police; 
Croatia does not have a gendarmerie or other paramilitary 
internal armed force) 
 
(2) There are some small off-budget receipts (from 
military-owned businesses, such as hotels and related 
businesses) which are reportedly audited by MOD internal 
auditors. 
 
-- An outstanding question currently under debate in the 
government is how to deal with the proceeds of privatized 
military property, including some desirable real estate on 
the coast.  One school advocates directing those proceeds 
directly back to MOD, to help with modernization and fund the 
social costs of the major downsizing currently going on. 
Another school believes that money should come back to the 
central treasury, which would facilitate monitoring and 
auditing.  This issue remains unresolved. 
 
C.  The Military Component of the National Budget 
 
(1) Military spending is barely two percent of GDP, scarcely 
enough to finance the modernization of the military (Croatia 
is a NATO aspirant).  We do not believe it receives priority 
over \"development\" spending. 
 
(2) Budget priorities can be and are debated in the 
Parliament. 
 
2.  Comment: While Croatia has a lot of room for improvement 
in its budgeting process in general -- an area it must 
improve upon to advance its NATO and EU aspirations -- we 
believe that Croatia meets the standards set out in the 
Transparency of Budgets legislation.

Summary and Comment 
 
1. (C) In recent weeks, the Counterintelligence Agency (POA) 
has been the focus of both media and parliamentary scrutiny 
because of its alleged intimidation of a journalist.  Helen 
Puljiz alleges that the POA tried to blackmail her in an 
attempt to persuade her to collaborate with them and provide 
information about President Mesic\' former advisor , who 
allegedly has links to indicted war criminal Ante Gotovina. 
Puljiz is now planning legal action against the POA for 
violating her human rights.  The independent Council for 
Oversight of the Security Services investigated and -- 
although it doubted the veracity of the POA\'s version of the 
story -- was unable to find any wrong-doing.  Parliament,s 
Committee for Internal Affairs and National Security also 
reviewed the case, but drew criticism for its weak 
investigation and possibly partisan findings.  On November 
25, Mesic forwarded a request to PM Sanader to dismiss POA 
Director Josek Podbevsek. 
 
2. (C) Human rights organizations and the press are 
criticizing the lack of civilian protection against the POA\'s 
methods and calling for a legal revamping to better protect 
citizens, human rights - but they are not accusing the GOC 
or the POA of attempting to stifle the media.  While the case 
has snowballed into a political issue ) because of upcoming 
presidential elections and because of institutional 
immaturity - at heart is the POA\'s methods for gathering 
intelligence.  It also highlights the lack of authority of 
parliamentary bodies to exercise appropriate control over 
security services.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
POA Oversteps Its Limits( 
 
3. (C) Last month, the POA called journalist Puljiz for an 
investigative interview during which officers allegedly 
offered her a newspaper job in return for information about 
Mesic\'s former advisor Zeljko Bagic and his links to ICTY 
fugitive Ante Gotovina via indicted fugitive tycoon Hrvoje 
Petrac.  When Puljiz demurred, the POA allegedly tried to 
intimidate and blackmail her with compromising tapes of her 
personal life.  Puljiz approached the Council for Oversight 
of the Security Services and requested an investigation. 
However, the Council concluded it could not determine whether 
the POA had violated Puljiz, rights.  Puljiz is now is 
planning legal action against the POA; the Journalist,s 
Association has taken on her cause and a subgroup has 
approached international organizations for assistance calling 
the Council,s work \"nontransparent.\"  Mesic stepped into the 
issue this week by signing a decision to dismiss POA Director 
Josko Podbevsek, stating that the POA infringed upon her 
Constitutional human rights and acted inappropriately in 
gathering information.  PM Sanader,s co-signature is 
required; he has refused to do so, charging that Mesic is 
politicizing the case because earlier this fall Mesic, 
advisor Zeljko Bagic was forced to resign and on November 23 
criminal charges were filed against him. (Reftel) 
 
(And Parliament Steps In 
 
4. (U) Last week Parliament,s National Security and Internal 
Affairs Commission also investigated, but not before GOC 
spokesman/HDZ party spokesman Ratko Macek leaked Commission 
findings stating the POA acted appropriately.  Suspecting 
collusion, opposition members of the Commission charged Macek 
with revealing secret material and questioned his access to 
Commission materials.  Parliament,s Commission also got 
bogged down when one independent MP revealed the sensitive 
contents of the Council\'s report.  Opposition members slammed 
his unprofessionalism and have called for a Parliamentary 
debate, asserting that so far all have failed to clarify the 
facts. 
 
Oversight Institutions Remain Weak 
 
5. (C) We spoke to Vlatko Cvrtila (strictly protect), 
Director of the Council for Civilian Supervision of Security 
Services about the case.  Cvrtila said that he was not 
satisfied by the POA\'s non-credible response that it only had 
the investigating officers\' notes of the conversation rather 
than a recorded version.  The incident underlines the lack of 
authority of his Council, Cvrtila said.  As neither the 
Council nor Parliament,s Commission have subpoena authority, 
the Council cannot hold the POA accountable if it in fact 
deceived the Council.  The case also demonstrates a lack of 
development of Croatia\'s parliamentary institutions: given 
Croatia\'s history of the security services taking on a 
political role, Cvrtila said was important for the parliament 
to assert true civilian supervision over these services to 
ensure their activities are directed against genuine threats. 
 
 As such he criticized Parliament,s President Vladimir Seks 
and its leadership for failing to deal with the political 
\"hot potato\" of revising the Council,s regulations to 
improve its oversight capabilities and provide it with 
permanent, professional staff. 
 
POA Operated in \"Gray Zone\" 
 
6. (C) Of equal concern is that this incident reflects a lack 
of professionalism on the part of the POA.  Under Croatian 
law, Puljiz had the right to refuse the POA\'s interview 
request.  Had she done so, the POA could have sought a court 
order and Puljiz could have had an attorney present. 
However, the POA has no such internal procedures, thus 
officers were able to operate in a gray zone where their 
activities may have been legal, but certainly were 
questionable.  The Centre for Peace Studies, a human rights 
organization, has called for amending the Security Services 
Act to better protect civilians by requiring that the POA 
tell citizens they have a right to refuse an interview and 
requiring that a record of an interview be given to the 
individual for confirmation.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND CROATIAN PRESIDENT MESIC DISCUSS 
MILITARY MOU, GOTOVINA, NATO, PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 
 
REF: A. ZAGREB 02002 
 
     B. ZAGREB 02044 
 
Classified By: Classified by Ambassador Ralph Frank; Reasons 1.4 (b) an 
d (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  The Ambassador asked Croatian President 
Stjepan Mesic to tone down the anti-U.S. rhetoric that has 
been a major element of his reelection strategy thus far. 
Mesic and the Ambassador also discussed the impact of 
Croatia\'s NATO accession on presidential authority over the 
armed forces; the Gotovina case; campaign strategy; and the 
case of a journalist, connected with a Mesic associate, who 
was allegedly interrogated by the security services. 
 
2.  (C)  Croatian President Stjepan Mesic invited the 
Ambassador via an intermediary to dinner November 30 to 
discuss several outstanding issues.  There was no publicity. 
Also present were Mesic\'s chief of cabinet Ambassador Davor 
Bozinovic, and informal advisors Zarko Kraljevic and Dr. 
Mladen Vedris (former Deputy Prime Minister).  Mesic was 
cordial and relaxed; the meeting lasted three hours. 
 
U.S. ) Croatian MOU on Military Exercises 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) The Ambassador told Mesic that he was concerned about 
the level of rhetoric Mesic and others had generated 
regarding the routine GOC-EUCOM MOU on military exercises 
signed last summer (ref A); Mesic\'s statements were 
provocative, and risked fanning anti-NATO and anti-U.S. 
flames; the U.S. should not become an issue in the upcoming 
presidential campaign, and given Mesic,s giant lead in the 
polls, it is completely unnecessary to \"run against\" the US. 
The Ambassador explained the substance of the MOU to Mesic, 
emphasized that we have similar agreements with all PfP 
countries, and noted that it does not obligate the GOC to do 
anything it does not want to do; it merely provides a 
framework for issues that must be discussed in preparation 
for military exercises. 
 
4.  (C) Mesic replied that his concern was the internal 
consultation process within the GOC, skirting the issue of 
his provocative statements. 
 
Gotovina Stops the Conversation 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Mesic asked the Ambassador\'s view on whether the EU 
would give Croatia a start date for accession negotiations at 
its meeting on December 17.  The Ambassador replied that many 
EU countries shared the U.S. view that full cooperation with 
ICTY required the GOC to get PIFWC Ante Gotovina arrested and 
to The Hague.  Without full cooperation, it was doubtful 
those EU states would support setting a date.  Mesic and 
colleagues appeared surprised at this remark; Mesic said he 
believed that the GOC had done all it could on the Gotovina 
issues, and he was clearly not in the country at this point. 
The Ambassador replied that establishing Gotovina\'s location 
outside Croatia did not meet the USG test for Croatia\'s ICTY 
cooperation -- Gotovina\'s presence in The Hague is the 
benchmark; many EU countries feel the same way.  It is 
important that the GOC understand the seriousness of the 
international community on this issue. 
 
NATO Accession Leads to Loss of Presidential Authority 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6.  (C) Mesic noted that he was concerned about a loss of 
presidential authority as Croatia continues the military 
modernization and NATO accession process.  He cited the 
Croatian Navy\'s transition into a Coast Guard, and therefore 
no longer part of a national security organization, as a 
degradation of presidential authority.  Likewise, the Air 
Force\'s evolution into an organization responsible for 
firefighting and transport is another example of a reduction 
of his defense responsibilities. 
 
Reelection Campaign Strategy 
---------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Mesic said he was pursuing an aggressive presidential 
campaign not because he was worried about losing (the latest 
polls give him three times the percentage of his nearest 
challenger), but because he wants to have the biggest 
possible electoral mandate to help him counter the HDZ 
government in his term, which he believes is pursuing 
worrisome policies. 
 
Puljiz Case Not Freedom of the Press Issue 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) Mesic also noted that the Puljiz case (ref B) was not 
really an issue of freedom of the press, but rather the 
 
 
government using Puljiz as a way to collect information on 
Mesic.  Allegedly, the intel services attempted to enlist 
Puljiz\'s ongoing cooperation, not because Puljiz was a 
journalist, but because she had a personal relationship with 
then presidential advisor, and now local indictee and subject 
of an EU travel ban, Zeljko Bagic. 
 
9.  (C) Comment:  Mesic\'s invitation to dinner/face-to-face 
discussion of contentious issues reflects his concern for 
U.S. views and his desire to make his views clearly known to 
us.  As last president of Yugoslavia, he reflects more than a 
passing nostalgia for the predictability of the socialist and 
non-aligned period. 
 
10.  (C) Comment, cont\'d:  Mesic also is a powerful moral 
tiller for Croatia\'s move toward necessary changes in 
preparation for Euro-Atlantic integration.  His \"apology\" for 
illegal acts committed against Serbs in the Balkan war is his 
most noteworthy example, but he also has been on the \"right\" 
side with respect to Croatia\'s role in World War II 
atrocities, and the offensive nature of occasional emergence 
of Ustashe/Nazi symbols.  Most recently he has been a strong 
proponent of Croatian cooperation with ICTY.

PRESIDENT ON BEHALF OF INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR 
 
REF: ZAGREB 02044 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ralph Frank; Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S) Summary:  PM Sanader and FM Zuzul asked Ambassador 
Frank and UK Ambassador Ramsden December 1 for assistance in 
persuading President Mesic to suspend seeking the dismissal 
of head of the Croatian Counter-Intelligence Agency 
Podbevsek, stating that his work was critical to the hunt for 
PIFWC Ante Gotovina. End Summary. 
 
2.  (S) PM Sanader and FM Zuzul invited Ambassador Frank and 
UK Ambassador John Ramsden to meet December 1 to discuss 
issues related to the capture of PIFWC Ante Gotovina. 
 
3.  (S) Sanader and Zuzul told the Ambassadors that President 
Mesic\'s effort to dismiss Josko Podbevsek,  new head of the 
counter-intelligence agency POA, was interfering in the 
effort to capture Gotovina.  Although President Mesic is 
trying to portray the Puljiz/Podbevsek case (ref) as being 
directed against him for political reasons, the investigation 
is really all about tracking down Gotovina.  The GOC has 
indicted Franjo Turek, a Mesic associate and former head of 
the POA, because it is convinced he is a valid target who has 
had telephone conversations with Gotovina.  Podbevsek is a 
critical player in the hunt for Gotovina; Mesic\'s effort to 
fire Podbevsek is a blow against that hunt. 
 
4.  (S) Sanader asked the Ambassadors to intervene with Mesic 
on behalf of Podbevsek.  Ambassador Frank and UK Ambassador 
Ramsden said they could not do so, because it would be 
directly interfering in Croatia\'s internal affairs. 
 
5.  (S) Ambassador Frank suggested an alternate approach to 
the PM: that the PM propose that he and the President make a 
joint public statement in support of apprehension of 
Gotovina, and the dedication of all elements of the 
Government of Croatia to that end.  Then it would be up to 
the PM to make the case to the President that Podbevsek 
remaining in place would be the key element of that effort. 
 
6.  (S) Comment: Podbevsek, while young (38) and 
inexperienced, has the PM\'s confidence on the Gotovina issue, 
and under his leadership, cooperation with the U.S. and the 
UK has greatly increased.  However, the full range of the 
PM\'s persuasive powers will be needed to convince the 
President of the merit of retaining Podbevsek.

SUBJECT: Minority Agreement Formalizes Protections 
 
Ref: (1) Zagreb 2103 (2) Belgrade 2482 
 
Summary and Comment 
 
1. (SBU) During his historic visit to Belgrade on 15 
November (Refs), PM Sanader and SAM PM Tadic signed an 
agreement on the protection of minorities in the two 
countries.  Focused on the ethnic Croat and ethnic Serb 
minorities in each country, the agreement does not set 
out new protections, but rather confirms the legal rights 
of the two minority groups and establishes a commission to monitor 
progress and implementation.  The third such bilateral 
minority agreement for Croatia, its significance is 
largely symbolic in establishing a technical framework 
for protection and discussion of minority issues.  End 
Summary and Comment. 
 
2. (SBU) Ethnic Serb party MP Milorad Pupovac told us he 
was generally pleased with the agreement, and fought 
successfully with the MFA for the inclusion of several 
provisions: references to refugee issues, the composition 
of the implementing commission, and \'acquired rights\' - 
referring to legal minority rights of ethnic Serbs 
which he believes are key.  He remains most interested in 
ensuring the right to use minority languages and promoting the 
activities of the National Minority Council in Croatia. 
Regarding the PM\'s visit to Belgrade, Pupovac was 
disappointed that the PM declined to visit the ethnic 
Serb refugee committee along side his visits with the 
Croat community and the Catholic Church.  The agreement 
also formally allows the GOC to support ethnic Croats in 
SAM, he noted.  Some ethnic Serb refugee groups, Pupovac 
said, criticized SAM for not pushing the missing persons 
issue more during negotiations. 
 
3. (SBU) According to Dunja Jevak, South East European 
Director at the MFA, the agreement contains no new 
elements but provides a standard for both countries.  The 
GOC is ahead of SAM in terms of minority representation 
and treatment, Jevak stated, and this agreement helps 
move SAM in the right direction.  Jevak admitted the 
Ministry\'s initial resistance to provisions pushed by the 
SDSS but agreed after recognizing that refugee issues 
were germane to the agreement and that no additional 
protections were involved. 
 
4. (U) The agreement offers similar protections as under 
the Constitution, including the right to education and 
public use of minority script (the parties agreed to 
special legislation on this point and on curriculum 
issues).  It pledges to support employment of minority 
members in education and to promote the availability of 
educational centers and media programs for minorities. 
In addition, the commitment to minority participation in 
local, regional and national government was confirmed, as 
was the protection of minority rights.  Unlike Croatia\'s 
other minority agreements, it establishes a joint 
committee to monitor implementation to be selected by 
Croatia\'s National Minority Council.  Minority agreements 
were previously signed with Italy and Hungary.

TAGS: SENV, ECON, PGOV, HR 
SUBJECT: CROATIA REQUESTS US SUPPORT FOR LENIENCY ON KYOTO 
TARGETS 
 
 
1. On December 7, the Croatian MFA submitted a request by 
diplomatic note for U.S. support for a GoC application for 
leniency in carbon dioxide emissions ahead of the UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference 
currently ongoing in Buenos Aires. The GoC believes 
fulfilling its Kyoto Protocol obligation to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions by 5% from 1990 levels would have negative 
economic effects and has applied under UNFCCC Article 4.6 for 
an increase of emissions over 1990 levels by 4.46 Mt. Eq-Co2. 
 
2. The diplomatic note reads as follows. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Croatia 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States 
of America in Zagreb and has the honor to inform the latter 
that, in the light of the expected entering into force of the 
Kyoto Protocol in February next year, Croatia is intensifying 
the activities toward its ratification.  In order to reach 
this objective, we still have an open question to be resolved. 
 
The Republic of Croatia became a party to the United Nations 
Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1996, and 
by undertaking the commitments outlined in Annex I, Croatia 
took an active part in the world,s efforts for the 
mitigation of climate change. 
 
It was in good faith that Croatia signed the Kyoto Protocol 
in 1999.  Having finished the first detailed national 
inventory, we realized that a reduction of 5% of GHG 
emissions in relation to the very low base year 1990 emission 
level (4.8 t CO2 per capita) would seriously jeopardize and 
make impossible any economic growth. 
 
Having such as outcome in mind, Croatia had to request 
flexibility under Article 4.6 of the UNFCCC to be applied in 
our case and asked for an increase of level emission of the 
base year by 4.46 Mt eq-CO2 in order to meet its Kyoto target 
by domestic measures.  In 2001, the Republic of Croatia 
officially submitted the request for application of Article 
4.6.  In the process of its consideration, we met all the 
conditions put before us by the UNFCCC bodies and interested 
parties of the Convention. 
 
The Convention bodies find Croatia eligible for application 
of Article 4.6  The final decision on our request is to be 
adopted on 10th Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC in Buenos 
Aires, December 2004. 
 
In order to commence the ratification process in Croatia in 
2005, we kindly ask for the support of your country,s 
delegation to enable the adoption of a positive decision 
regarding the Croatian request. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affaires of the Republic of Croatia 
avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of 
the Untied States of America in Zagreb the assurances of its 
highest consideration.

SUBJECT: CROATIA FINALLY PROVIDES DATA EXCLUSIVITY; 
PIPELINE PROTECTION IN DOUBT 
 
REF: A. ZAGREB 1836 AND PREVIOUS 
     B. TELCOM ERRION/DETWILER 11/17/04 
 
1.  (U) On December 3, the Croatian parliament passed an 
amendment to the Drug Law which provides data exclusivity 
(protection against other companies using clinical trial data 
provided to the government as a condition of marketing 
authorization).  The protection lasts for six years after the 
drug is first registered in either Croatia or in any EU 
member country.  While the language is not as strong as that 
originally sought in the 1998 bilateral MOU on Intellectual 
Property (there is usually a lag of several years between 
when a drug is first registered somewhere in the EU and in 
Croatia), local U.S. pharmaceutical representatives have 
voiced their satisfaction with the provision.  The opposition 
in parliament unsuccessfully attacked the legislation, 
charging the government with ignoring the interests of the 
Croatian health system and Croatian pharmaceutical companies. 
 The government defended the measure, citing obligations 
under the MOU and to the EU. 
 
2.  (SBU) We understand from Ref B that the interagency group 
considering the initiatation of exchange of dipnotes 
necessary to bring the MOU into effect has determined that 
the USG cannot currently meet all the requirements of the 
MOU, and therefore will not bring the MOU into effect.  In 
the absence of a determination that the USG is willing to 
bring the MOU into force, the embassy is uncertain about the 
prospects for pursuing pipeline protection legislation, which 
would have provided our companies a \"second chance\" to patent 
drugs not currently protected.  As we understand it, such a 
provision is not called for under TRIPS; our argument for it 
was based on the obligations of the MOU.  If the USG is now 
doubtful about bringing the MOU into force, we will have 
difficulty pressing the GOC on that basis.

REF: A) ZAGREB 2044 B) ZAGREB 2060 
 
Classified By: Poloff Justin Friedman, reasons 1.4 (B) & (D) 
 
SUMMARY and COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. (C) The scandal (reftels) surrounding the Counter 
Intelligence Agency (POA) 
has peaked with President Mesic and Prime Minister Sanader 
agreeing to fire POA 
Chief Josko Podbevsek and nominate Tomislav Karamarko as his 
replacement. 
Prior to his successful confirmation hearings and official 
installation on 
December 15, Karamarko told us on December 13 that he planned 
to focus on 
professionalizing the POA, improving international 
cooperation including in the 
search for ICTY fugitive Ante Gotovina, and promoting his 
vision of unifying 
the direction of the intelligence agencies under a single 
leadership along the 
lines of recent U.S. reforms.  Karamarko, who resigned as 
director of the now 
defunct National Security Office in 2002 when these same 
reform proposals were 
rejected,  will face an uphill battle to centralize control 
of Croatian 
intelligence agencies in a country where most of the 
political class have 
personal and often bitter memories of the abuse of 
intelligence powers by the 
Yugoslav and Tudjman governments.  END SUMMARY and COMMENT. 
 
OLD NEW FACE FOR POA 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) Following accusations that agents of the Counter 
Intelligence Agency 
(POA) acted unethically, if not necessarily illegally in 
attempting to coerce 
journalist Helena Puliz into acting as a POA informant (ref 
A), President Mesic 
and PM Sanader agreed last week to fire POA chief Josko 
Podbevsek.  Late on 
Friday (Dec. 10), they agreed to nominate Tomislav Karamarko 
as his 
replacement.  Karamarko told us on Monday (Dec. 13) that he 
had been reluctant 
to leave the security business he had founded and take a 
salary cut to 
return to public service.  Ultimately, he said, it was 
Mesic\'s personal appeal 
that compelled Karamarko to say yes.  Karamarko has a long 
public service career 
(see Bio Notes), last serving as head of the National 
Security Office (UNS) 
until 2002 when he resigned when his intelligence reform 
plans were not 
accepted by the then coalition government. 
 
GOTOVINA CASE 
------------- 
 
3. (C) Karamarko claims that the press has distorted his 
views on the 
Gotovina case.  He admitted that he has publicly stated that 
it would be better 
if suspected war criminals were tried in Croatian courts. 
Karamarko told us 
that he still thinks that the Gotovina indictment was 
politically motivated, 
rather than legally justified.  However, he believes that 
Gotovina must prove 
his innocence in The Hague.  When we reminded him that the 
international community 
will judge the Croatia and the Croatian intelligence 
community on the basis of how it 
performs in the Gotovina case, Karamarko said he would insist 
on professional 
behavior from his organization, including fully cooperating 
in the search for 
Gotovina. 
 
REFORM PLANS 
------------ 
 
4. (C) Karamarko said he wanted the POA to become a full 
partner in the global 
coalition fighting terrorism.  His priorities would be to 
improve the 
professionalism of the POA in order to ensure that the rights 
 
of citizens were 
fully respected and that the POA\'s activities could never 
been seen as 
politically motivated.  He also said he would immediately 
take steps to stop 
leaks of POA information to the press.  Beyond that, 
Karamarko said he would 
like to improve international cooperation, particularly with 
the U.S.  In 
addition, Karamarko said he would pursue his reform agenda of 
bringing 
management of Croatian intelligence organizations together 
along the lines of 
recently approved reforms in the U.S. 
 
BIO NOTES 
--------- 
 
5. (U) Karamarko has a long professional association with 
President Mesic.  He 
joined the HDZ in 1990 as an early founding member.  He 
became chief of the 
City of Zagreb Police in 1995, but ran afoul of hard-line HDZ 
rightists Ivic 
Pasalic, Ljubo Cesic-Rojs, and Miroslav Kutle for his 
investigations into their 
corrupt business dealings, and was removed from that office. 
In 2000 Karamarko 
served as chief of Mesic\'s presidential campaign and became 
both National 
Security Advisor and head of the National Security Office 
(UNS) upon Mesic\'s 
election victory.  According to press reports, as head of the 
UNS, Karamarko 
came into conflict with the POA predecessor organization, the 
Police 
Intelligence Service (SZUP) when he tried to assert control 
over its 
controversial activities.  Karamarko left the UNS when that 
organization was 
shut down in 2002 under an intelligence reform law passed by 
the coalition 
government. 
 
6. (SBU) Karamarko understands and speaks only limited 
English.

SUBJECT: FM VISIT BOOSTS RUSSIA-CROATIA RELATIONS 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: In an effort to shore up 
Moscow\'s influence in this Brussels-leaning capital, Russian 
FM Sergei Lavrov met with President Stjepan Mesic, PM Ivo 
Sanader, Speaker of Parliament Vladimir Seks, and FM Miomir 
Zuzul on his December 10 visit to Zagreb.  Significant 
developments included agreement on the settlement of 
Soviet-era debt to Yugoslavia, discussions of promoting 
Russian investment in Croatia\'s energy and tourism sectors, 
groundwork for future anti-terror and anti-drug trafficking 
agreements, and interest in selling hardware to the Croatian 
military during its modernization to NATO standards.  The two 
FMs agreed on a plan of consultation, but an expected visit 
by Russian President Vladimir Putin has not yet been 
scheduled.  The GOC got what it wanted in Soviet debt 
repayment; the rest of the visit was primarily a scouting 
trip for Russian investment opportunities.  END SUMMARY AND 
COMMENT. 
 
PLANES, TURBINES, AND PIPELINES 
------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) Lavrov\'s visit represented a potential warming of 
bilateral relations and, the GoC hopes, increased Russian 
interest in economic opportunities in Croatia, according to 
Vesna Klaic, MFA\'s director of bilateral relations with 
Eurasian countries.  The last Russian FM to visit Croatia was 
Jevgeny Primakov in 1998, when Croatia\'s situation, both 
politically and economically, was far different.  Lavrov 
expressed complete Russian support for Croatia\'s EU 
candidacy. 
 
3. (SBU) Agreement on in-kind payments in the form of 
fire-fighting aircraft, power plant turbines, and gas 
pipelines to settle the full value of the $185.7 million due 
Croatia from Soviet-era debt represented a particular 
achievement for the GoC.  According to Klaic, standard 
Russian practice in other countries of the former Yugoslavia 
has been to negotiate a 25 percent reduction. 
 
RUSSIA INTERESTED IN INVESTING IN TOURISM, MILITARY SALES 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
4. (U) Lavrov was particularly interested in advancing 
economic relations, and the GoC intends to pursue his offer 
to initiate a joint campaign to promote Russian investment in 
Croatia, particularly in the energy and tourism sectors. 
Discussions focused on the Druzba-Adria pipeline, a 
controversial project to carry oil from Russia to the port of 
Omisalj on the northern Croatian island of Krk.  Moscow is 
extremely interested in this project, according to Lavrov, 
but respects Croatia\'s ongoing environmental review process 
and consideration of potential damage to Croatian tourism. 
Research is now complete for an environmental impact report, 
but the GoC is still assessing the information and has not 
yet released any findings. 
 
5. (U) Just days after Lavrov\'s departure, the ruling 
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) presidential candidate 
Jadranka Kosor declared her opposition to Druzba-Adria 
(putting her slightly beyond the GoC\'s official neutrality) 
and environmental protestors organized rallies in Zagreb and 
several coastal cities against the project.  President Mesic, 
on the other hand, remains open to the project and has called 
for an informed public debate, noting that oil tankers are 
already entering the Adriatic bound for Italian and Slovenian 
ports and no one is protesting against them. 
 
6. (SBU) Lavrov also came to Zagreb looking for a piece of 
the military modernization pie.  \"Military and technical 
cooperation\" discussions centered on Russian-made hardware 
that could serve the Croatian military\'s needs in upgrading 
to NATO standards. 
 
ANTI-TERROR, COUNTER-DRUG AGREEMENTS ON HORIZON 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
7. (SBU) Lavrov and Zuzul began the groundwork for future 
bilateral agreements on preventing terrorism and drug 
trafficking and responding to civil disasters.  MFA consular 
experts will go to Moscow in January to pursue to pursue 
accelerated visa procedures.  According to Klaic, Russian 
police checks are slowing down visas for Croatian business 
travelers. 
 
8. (U) The FMs also discussed proposals for intercity 
cooperation, including a planned sister city relationship 
between Kaliningrad and Rijeka.  According to Lavrov, the GoR 
will establish Russian cultural center in Croatia and a Forum 
for Slavic Culture that will link all Slavic peoples.

SUBJECT: HIV/AIDS IN CROATIA: LOW PREVALENCE AND LOW 
AWARENESS 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1.  Croatia\'s few registered cases of HIV/AIDS and low 
knowledge about the disease and how it spreads translate into 
an HIV/AIDS strategy focused on prevention and education. 
Stigmatization continues be an obstacle, as alarmist press 
accounts beat out a small cadre of dedicated health 
professionals in dictating the terms of the HIV/AIDS 
discussion.  A long-overdue updated National Action Plan and 
proposed anti-discrimination law are encouraging signs that 
Croatia is getting serious about dealing with HIV/AIDS before 
it becomes a major problem. 
 
2.  This is the first in a series of three cables looking at 
HIV/AIDS in Croatia.  Reports on Global Fund efforts to 
expand free, anonymous testing and efforts to combat high 
antiretroviral drug prices will follow septel.  END SUMMARY 
AND COMMENT 
 
PREVALENCE 
---------- 
 
3.  With just 470 registered cases in a population of 4.4 
million, Croatia\'s HIV/AIDS prevalence is low.  Two hundred 
eighteen individuals currently receive drug treatment for 
AIDS.  Four out of five infected are men.  Transmission since 
1985 has occurred primarily by sexual contact within the 
homosexual (38%) and heterosexual (27%) communities; 
intravenous drug users account for 10% of all HIV infections. 
Two cases of transmission occurred via blood transfusion in 
2004.  Most reported cases come from large cities; however, 
large cities also have the best mechanisms for reporting new 
cases. 
 
4.  Official statistics likely underestimate the true extent 
of the problem owing to complicated (but improving) 
bureaucratic procedures to get confirmed test results and to 
register a case with the national health system.   Whereas 
patients until recently were given a choice of paying cash 
for an HIV test or presenting their national insurance card 
-- with identifying details -- to their care provider, 
Croatia\'s health system now allows for free and anonymous 
testing.  Official GoC HIV/AIDS statistics come from drug 
treatment centers (including needle exchange centers), 
hospitals, HIV testing centers, and blood transfusion centers. 
 
JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS FAIL TO SHAKE PUBLIC APATHY 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5.  Croatia\'s low prevalence of HIV/AIDS coexists with 
sensationalist journalism, silence from political leaders, 
and indifference from most of the public.  Media coverage 
surrounding a trafficking victim in Mostar (reftel) and a man 
in Split publicly accused of intentionally spreading HIV 
brought HIV/AIDS to the headlines just ahead of World AIDS 
Day 2004.  A large daily recently ran a headline announcing 
that a Split-based herbologist had \'cured\' 5 patients of 
AIDS.  A number of NGO-sponsored group discussions and film 
festivals included speeches specifically criticizing 
journalists for creating anxieties about AIDS rather than 
promoting a serious discussion on how HIV is transmitted and 
how Croatians can protect themselves.  Yet whereas alarmism 
characterizes the reporting on HIV, silence seems more the 
rule in the political class, as politicians frequently go to 
great lengths to avoid speaking up on HIV/AIDS for fear of 
alienating voters.  The Church has likewise shied away from 
speaking out about HIV/AIDS, though some in the NGO community 
have expressed frustration with the Church\'s obstructionism 
in expanding peer education.  Tabloid journalism and 
political silence in general, however, have done little to 
shake public indifference. 
 
REASONS FOR OPTIMISM -- A NEW NATIONAL PLAN AND 
ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAW 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.  On the occasion of World AIDS Day, Croatia\'s reconfigured 
National AIDS Committee convened for the first time all year 
on December 1 to adopt an updated National Action Plan on 
combating the spread of HIV/AIDS.  The plan, drafted by the 
Ministry of Health to replace the previous 1993 version, 
emphasizes assistance to people living with HIV/AIDS, 
targeted interventions into at-risk populations, expanded 
peer education, upping test numbers through voluntary 
counseling and testing centers, and improved surveillance of 
how HIV/AIDS spreads in Croatia.  The Committee\'s membership 
includes a mix of Ministry of Health politicians, 
immunologists, NGOs, doctors, the UNDP Resident 
Representative, and a Catholic priest.  NGOs and GoC 
 
 
representatives were united in supporting the updated plan as 
a positive step towards de-stigmatization and prevention, 
while stressing that its implementation -- with Global Fund 
assistance -- had been ongoing since 2003. 
 
7.  Croatia has no law banning discrimination against 
individuals with HIV/AIDS; however, the Labor Law provides 
some protection from discrimination in hiring and firing. 
Several HIV-themed NGOs recently teamed up with a professor 
from the Zagreb Faculty of Law to draft a comprehensive 
anti-discrimination law that would incorporate HIV/AIDS 
discrimination into a larger disabilities movement.  The 
proposed law would address discrimination in employment, 
education, welfare payments, and access to legal services 
while criminalizing mandatory HIV testing and hate speed 
associated with HIV/AIDS.  The law will also ban 
discrimination based on membership in a risk group or 
personal connections to an infected person.  The NGO 
consortium believes they have support in the Parliamentary 
Committee on Human Rights and hopes to have the bill ready 
for debate by March.

SUBJECT: 2004 GMO AND BIOSAFETY DEVELOPMENTS IN CROATIA 
 
REF: STATE 259661 
 
1.  Reftel requested an update on biosafety issues in 
preparation for the next meeting of the parties to the Cartagena 
Protocol. As an EU candidate country, Croatia will almost 
certainly follow the EC lead on any biosafety or GMO issue. 
Following is an overview of recent developments on these issues. 
 
2. Three laws passed in 2003 (the Law on Food, the Law on Nature 
Protection, and the Law on Consumer Protection) establish a 
regulatory framework for the introduction of GMO crops and foods 
to Croatia; in fact, given the absence of a working registration 
system, they constitute a de-facto ban on GMO products. 
Responsibility for biotech policy is divided among three 
ministries. 
 
3.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Management 
shares responsibility with the Ministry of Culture for licensing 
and testing GMO seeds. The Ministry of Agriculture is also 
responsible for \"cleaning-up\" unauthorized GMO release into 
nature. Minister of Agriculture Petar Cobankovic has taken it 
upon himself (above and beyond the law) to compensate farmers 
whose land was contaminated by the unauthorized release of 
Pioneer GMO seeds this summer; currently the Ministry is suing 
Pioneer to recoup its expense.  The case is likely to be tied up 
in Croatian courts for years. 
 
4.  The Ministry of Culture is responsible for \"nature 
protection\":  regulating the release into nature of GMOs. When 
the GoC passed the Law on Nature Protection in 2003, the nature 
protection portfolio originally fell to the Ministry of 
Environment; in January 2004, a newly-elected GoC shifted 
responsibility for registering and licensing GMO seeds to the 
Ministry of Culture. The Ministry of Culture is also responsible 
for insuring GMO seeds are not planted on any of Croatia\'s 
numerous protected areas. 
 
5.   A GoC bill on novel foods has passed its first reading in 
the Parliament, and will be taken up again in early 2005.  The 
law is designed to establish a clear regulatory and licensing 
procedure for GMO crops and food.  It has been painted as a 
necessary part of EU legislative harmonization, and though it 
would allow GMOs on the Croatian market, press reports focus on 
the great difficulties the law would impose of potential GMO 
importers and harsh financial penalties for unauthorized GMO 
release.  The Institute for Public Health houses the only in- 
country facility capable of testing foods for GMOs.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION - MESIC IN FIRST ROUND? 
 
REF: A. ZAGREB 02002 
     B. ZAGREB 01601 
     C. ZAGREB 01571 
 
1. SUMMARY AND COMMENT: President Stjepan Mesic appears 
poised to win a second five-year mandate in the upcoming 
presidential election; the only question that remains is 
whether he will get the necessary 50 percent   one vote in 
the first round on January 2 or face a second round against 
his nearest rival on January 16.  While Mesic and Jadranka 
Kosor of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) are the 
only ones with a hope of making a second round, 11 other 
contenders signed on for the short, holiday-season campaign, 
more candidates than in any presidential election since 
Croatian independence. 
 
2. While none of the other 11 is likely to break even five 
percent at the polls, they have come out of the woodwork for 
a variety of reasons.  The most colorful characters of the 
race (a soccer coach who led Croatia to third place in the 
1998 World Cup, a former army general turned shady 
entrepreneur turned extremist politician, and a \"local boy 
does good\" millionaire back from Minnesota) seem bent on 
self-promotion.  Others are using the election campaign to 
voice right-wing beliefs from which they feel the HDZ 
government has strayed.  The rest are in the business of 
party building - increasing name recognition and mobilizing 
activists for local elections expected in April or May 2005. 
 
3. With results so predictable (Mesic is consistently polling 
around 50 percent, while Kosor is lucky to draw 20 percent 
with only 15 percent left undecided), the election\'s real 
value may in the end be to show PM Ivo Sanader just how small 
the extreme right of Croatian politics is, encouraging him to 
continue, and perhaps even step up, reforms on the path to 
Euro-Atlantic integration.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
WISECRACKS AND WISDOM ) MESIC AS THE CITIZEN PRESIDENT 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4. At age 71, Mesic remains the nation\'s most popular 
politician, a classic populist who often serves as the moral 
compass of the nation.  Throughout his five years in office, 
he has cultivated his image as the genial and witty \"citizen 
president,\" in sharp contrast to the oft bad-tempered style 
of his predecessor, Franjo Tudjman.  Known in U.S. circles as 
a leading opponent to Article 98 and troops to Iraq, Mesic 
has actually played an extremely positive role in Croatian 
politics since the 1960s. 
 
5. Mesic was imprisoned for a year for his role in the 
\"Croatian Spring\" of 1971, a movement against Belgrade\'s 
domination of Yugoslavia.  Mesic later served briefly as the 
last president of Yugoslavia and even more briefly as 
Croatia\'s first prime minister.  He returned to parliament as 
speaker in early 90s, but then left in protest against the 
HDZ\'s policy promoting the division of Bosnia.  Mesic became 
one of Tudjman\'s most outspoken critics, and as president he 
can claim at least some credit for leading Croatia out of the 
international isolation brought on by Tudjman\'s regime.  He 
also spearheaded efforts to amend Croatia\'s constitution, 
greatly reducing the presidential powers of Tudjman\'s day and 
transforming the country into a parliamentary democracy.  He 
has focused on his experience during the campaign, asking 
voters to let him continue to improve the nation. 
 
CROATIA\'S SOCIAL CHAMPION: KOSOR ON THE SOFT ISSUES 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
6. Kosor, currently deputy prime minister and minister of 
family, veterans, affairs, and intergenerational solidarity, 
was selected as the HDZ candidate only weeks before the 
campaign began and faces a steep uphill battle against Mesic. 
 Simply forcing a second round would be a huge success.  The 
HDZ, however, has opened its checkbook and activated its 
political machine, making Kosor by far the most promoted 
candidate in the campaign. 
 
7. Kosor\'s radio programs for refugees and other victims 
during the war years in the mid-1990s first endeared her to 
the Croatian public.  She then became a parliamentarian and 
later deputy chair of the HDZ.  Kosor thrives on social 
issues and has focused her campaign on improving living 
conditions for disadvantaged groups.  She has stepped ahead 
of the HDZ on a few issues, perhaps to show herself as more 
than Sanader\'s puppet, taking an absolutist stance against 
sending troops to Iraq, calling the indictment against 
Gotovina flawed, and flatly opposing the controversial 
Druzba-Adria oil pipeline from Russia to the Croatia coast. 
However, her Mother Theresa image, as Mesic calls it, 
continues to define her.  In classic Mesic style, he has 
lately taken to calling his opponent \"Lady Suzanna,\" after 
she wept at campaign event (\"suza\" is Croatian for tear). 
 
SHOUTS FROM THE FRINGES 
----------------------- 
 
8. The marginal voices in the campaign have tended toward the 
extreme, with several candidates claiming that ICTY fugitive 
Ante Gotovina should not surrender to The Hague, and others 
focusing on reasons why Croatia does not need the EU. 
Fortunately, all of the far right candidates combined will be 
unlikely to break 10 percent on January 2. 
 
9. The GoC has opened 155 polling places in 50 countries for 
the Croatian diaspora and Croatians in BiH and SaM, who enjoy 
the rights of citizenship without ever stepping foot in 
Croatia.  This will likely give a needed boost to Kosor, as 
the HDZ dominates in communities outside the country, and is 
probably her only hope in forcing a second round.

1. SUMMARY AND COMMENT: President Stjepan Mesic fell one 
percent short of the simple majority he needed for a first 
round re-election on January 2, finishing the day at 49 
percent of the 2.2 million votes cast.  He will face Croatian 
Democratic Union (HDZ) nominee Jadranka Kosor, who received 
20 percent of the vote, in a two-candidate runoff on January 
16.  The biggest surprise was clearly the third-place 
candidate, a Croatian-American businessman who stunned 
political analysts with a finish just below 18 percent, 
nearly edging Kosor out of the second round.  The remaining 
ten candidates each finished below 3 percent.  NGO observers 
reported no irregularities at the polls.  Mesic, who finished 
first in all 21 Croatian electoral districts, is expected to 
win an easy second round victory, but the HDZ political 
machine is likely to kick into high gear in the next two 
weeks and could turn out enough voters to partially erode 
Mesic\'s 30-point lead.  It remains to be seen whether Miksic 
voters, who apparently were looking for new faces in Croatian 
politics, will go for Kosor on January 16 ) or perhaps not 
vote at all.   END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
MIKSIC STEALS THE SHOW 
---------------------- 
 
2. Boris Miksic, a Croatian-American who immigrated in the 
1970s and made a fortune in composite plastics in his adopted 
home state of Minnesota, shocked the country as he led Kosor 
in exit polls until the diaspora vote was counted, dropping 
him to third place.  Miksic, who personally funded all of his 
5-million kuna (USD 1 million) campaign (nearly twice what 
Mesic spent), tapped into disaffected right-of-center 
voters, frustration with a HDZ government that they feel has 
focused on Euro-Atlantic integration at the expense of 
domestic priorities and conservative values. 
 
3. Miksic\'s finish illustrates a call for new faces in 
Croatian politics.  He entered the race in November as a 
relatively unknown figure, having unsuccessfully run for 
parliament in 2003, and actually withdrew before the election 
date was announced due to what he said was the media ignoring 
his campaign.  Apparently enough newspapers noticed his 
departure to prompt him to quickly re-enter the race.  He 
focused his campaign on improving Croatia\'s economy, which he 
said should be done before entering EU negotiations.  He also 
gathered some far right votes with promises that ICTY 
fugitive Ante Gotovina would walk freely in Croatia under his 
presidency. 
 
4. Miksic said he does not intend to tell his voters whom 
they should support in the second round, but Kosor would be 
the natural choice for most.  We may see the HDZ court Miksic 
prior to January 16 in an effort to win his endorsement. 
Miksic has made a big enough splash to stir up Croatian 
politics, and may be recruited by other parties as well. 
 
KOSOR CALLS FOR DEBATE ON THE ISSUES, NOT PERSONAL JABS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5. A defeat at the hands of Miksic would have been a disaster 
for Kosor and the HDZ, who can thank diaspora voters for 
saving their collective skin.  The low, 51 percent voter 
turnout (compared to the typical 70 percent) also hurt Kosor, 
and probably Mesic as well, as base voters who saw the 
election as a foregone conclusion stayed home.  After 
breathing a deep sigh of relief when the official preliminary 
results were announced at midnight, Kosor quickly launched 
into round two, challenging Mesic to debate her on the 
issues.  This would be a welcome change from round one, when 
the discourse focused on one-liners and personal insults. 
 
6. COMMENT: Mesic was perhaps too comfortable with his 
30-plus percentage point lead in pre-election polls, letting 
Kosor\'s massive media blitz overshadow his campaign.  To 
assure victory, he now must energize his voters, as turnout 
could be even lower in the second round.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: HIV/AIDS IN CROATIA -- GLOBAL FUND FILLING A VOID 
ON EDUCATION AND OUTREACH 
 
REF: ZAGREB 2171 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1.  With a three-year, $5 million commitment in Croatia, the 
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis has made 
possible free and anonymous HIV testing in three urban 
centers of Croatia and supported NGO education and outreach 
to vulnerable populations.  Given Croatia\'s low prevalence 
and low awareness of HIV/AIDS, the Global Fund has played a 
crucial role in two areas -- education and targeted 
intervention -- whereas the GoC has focused its resources in 
treatment and care.  Though stigma and lack of understanding 
pose significant obstacles to outreach and education efforts, 
Global Fund support and superb local partners have already 
made significant progress expanding access to testing and 
educating vulnerable populations about preventing new HIV 
infections. 
 
2.  This is the second in a series of three cables looking at 
HIV/AIDS in Croatia.  Reftel provides a snapshot of the 
current situation and Croatia\'s National Action Plan on AIDS, 
while a description of Croatia\'s drug treatment efforts will 
be reported septel.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
3.  Since 2003, the Global Fund has been essential to GoC 
efforts to prevent new HIV/AIDS infections -- it features in 
Croatia\'s updated National Action Plan on HIV/AIDS and the 
Ministry of Health has appointed a coordinator for Global 
Fund activities.  Consistent with the Global Fund\'s aim of 
supplementing rather than replacing local contributions, the 
Ministry of Health has channeled Global Fund resources to 
areas overlooked by the GoC state budget and national health 
insurance system but specifically noted by the National 
HIV/AIDS Committee as areas where work is needed -- targeted 
inventions into vulnerable populations and education.  GoC 
expenditures on HIV/AIDS have remained steady at around $2.5 
million -- with 90% going to drug treatment, 9% to 
prevention, and 1% to research. 
 
GLOBAL FUND OUTSIDE OF ZAGREB -- CASES FROM RIJEKA AND SPLIT 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
4.  Two Voluntary Counseling and Testing centers (VCTs) 
opened in 2004 in Rijeka and Split (Croatia\'s second and 
third largest cities) thanks to Global Fund support funneled 
through the Ministry of Health.  A third renovated facility 
will open in Zagreb in December 2004.  In Rijeka, the local 
partner NGO Terra works with intravenous drug users, 
commercial sex workers, and the sizeable local sailor 
population on HIV/AIDS awareness and strategies to reduce 
risky behaviors.  As a member of RiskNet, Terra works closely 
with similar outreach NGOs in BiH, SaM, Bulgaria, and Romania 
on methods of reaching vulnerable populations.  Terra\'s 
president also sits on the National AIDS Committee to keep 
national health leaders informed about targeted invention 
progress. 
 
5.  The Global Fund provides 70% of the budget of a 
Split-based NGO HELP that has worked with Split County\'s 
sizeable intravenous drug user population since 1990. 
According to the NGO\'s president, Global Fund and local 
government support are the two most important factors in 
HELP\'s success promoting testing and HIV awareness among drug 
users.  With Global Fund money, HELP is for the first time 
able to provide free drop-in testing and counseling services 
for six hours every week in cooperation with the County 
Institute for Public Health.  (All HELP employees -- even 
their financial manager -- receive counseling training.) 
Thanks to Global Fund support, HELP has also been able to 
expand its geographic reach through a mobile outreach and 
awareness-raising program.  HELP is also working on building 
a regional network of NGOs that work with IV drug users in 
Croatia, BiH, and SaM to share techniques and information. 
 
INTEGRATING GLOBAL FUND INTO CROATIA\'S HEALTH SYSTEM 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6.  Health professionals and NGOs are eager to continue 
Global Fund-inspired outreach and education programs after 
the project\'s end in Croatia in 2006.  The Ministry of Health 
is eager to integrate Croatia\'s three VCTs into the national 
health system.  Priorities for 2005 include establishing a 
fourth VCT in Croatia\'s overlooked eastern region and 
integrating a peer education program into Croatian high 
schools.
