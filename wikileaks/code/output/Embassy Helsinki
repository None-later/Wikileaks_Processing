1. (C) FINNISH PRESIDENT TARJA HALONEN TRAVELED TO 
MOSCOW JUNE 7 FOR THE FINLAND-RUSSIA SUMMIT AND HER 
FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN.  THE MAIN 
PURPOSE OF THE MEETING WAS TO PROVIDE THE LEADERS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SIZE EACH OTHER UP.  OVERALL THE FINNS 
WERE IMPRESSED WITH PUTIN\'S GRASP OF THE ISSUES, AND 
(AT LEAST ACCORDING TO FINNISH OFFICIALS) THE RUSSIANS 
WITH FINLAND\'S FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT.  HALONEN 
DELIVERED THE FIRM MESSAGE TO PUTIN THAT MANY OF 
RUSSIA\'S POLICIES, FOR EXAMPLE IN CHECHNYA AND SERBIA, 
WERE INCONSISTENT WITH FUNDAMENTAL DEMOCRATIC AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS PRINCIPLES SHARED BY THE TRANSATLANTIC COMMUNITY 
TO WHICH RUSSIA ASPIRED. 
 
2. (C) HALONEN ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE TO THE 
EU-RUSSIA RELATIONSHIP OF THE IMMINENT EU MEMBERSHIP OF 
ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA AND THE SUBSEQUENT 
LENGTHENING OF THE RUSSIA-EU BORDER.  PUTIN LAUNCHED 
INTO AN ATTACK ON THE BALTICS AND THEIR TREATMENT OF 
THE RUSSIAN MINORITIES. 
 
3. (C) ACCORDING TO FINNISH OFFICIALS WHO ACCOMPANIED 
PRESIDENT HALONEN, RUSSIAN VIEWS OF THE JUST-ENDED 
U.S.-RUSSIA SUMMIT TRACKED WITH WHAT THEY HAD HEARD 
FROM US.  FM IVANOV SEEMED UPBEAT ABOUT THE SUMMIT, BUT 
PUTIN APPEARED CONTENTIOUS AND SAID THAT A U.S. 
DECISION TO GO FORWARD WITH NMD WOULD UNLEASH AN ARMS 
RACE. END SUMMARY 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

4. (C) IN ACCORD WITH THE AGREEMENT POTUS AND PRESIDENT 
HALONEN MADE DURING HALONEN\'S RECENT VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON, HALONEN\'S CHIEF OF STAFF JAAKKO KALELA GAVE 
AMBASSADOR EDELMAN A QUICK READ-OUT OF THE HALONEN- 
PUTIN SUMMIT IN MOSCOW ON JUNE 7.  MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
GENERAL FOR RUSSIA AND NIS RENE NYBERG ELABORATED ON 
THE VISIT JUNE 9, SHARING WITH US BOTH THE GOF\'S 
REPORT TO OTHER EU MEMBERS (VIA COREU) AND A MORE 
DETAILED, INTERNAL GOF REPORT (PLEASE PROTECT). 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
RUSSIA\'S POLICIES AT ODDS WITH WESTERN VALUES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) PUTIN WAS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN TAKING THE 
MEASURE OF HALONEN. THEIR DISCUSSION CENTERED ON 
CHECHNYA, KOSOVO/SERBIA, AND IRAQ.  HALONEN STRESSED 
THAT RUSSIAN POLICY IN ALL THESE AREAS PUT THEM AT ODDS 
WITH BASIC EU PRINCIPLES.  REFLECTINQ THEIR TRAINING AS 
LAWYERS, AT TIMES THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO 
GAVE THE APPEARANCE OF TWO ATTORNEYS PLEADING THE CASE 
FOR THEIR CLIENTS.  KALELA SAID THIS WAS NOT A 
DISCUSSION OF \"FACTS BUT VALUES.\"  ACCORDING TO KALELA 
(WHO HAS BEEN CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE LAST THREE FINNISH 
PRESIDENTS) HALONEN HELD HER OWN WITH PUTIN WHO, AT ONE 
POINT, EXCLAIMED \"YOU ARE A VERY DANGEROUS WOMAN.\" 
NYBERG CONFIRMED THAT HALONEN MADE THE SAME GENERAL 
IMPRESSION ON THE OTHER RUSSIAN OFFICIALS PARTICIPATING 
IN THE PLENARY SESSION.

PUTIN\'S RUDE WARNING TO FINNS: DON\'T DISCUSS KARELIA 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6. (C) PUTIN RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE TERRITORY FINLAND 
WAS FORCED TO CEDE TO THE SOVIET UNION AFTER WORLD WAR 
II (KARELIA) IN THE PRIVATE SESSION. 
 
--   NOTE: THIS IS A VERY EMOTIONAL ISSUE FOR MANY 
     FINNS.  OVER 400,000 KARELIANS LEFT THEIR HOMES IN 
     THE CEDED TERRITORIES AND WERE RESETTLED 
     THROUGHOUT FINLAND.  IT REMAINS A TOPIC OF LIVELY 
     PUBLIC DEBATE AND EVEN PLAYED A PART IN THE RECENT 
     FINNISH PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. END NOTE 
 
PUTIN SAID THAT CONTINUED DISCUSSION IN FINLAND ABOUT 
THE POSSIBLE RETROCESSION OF KARELIA TO FINLAND COULD 
DAMAGE THE RUSSIAN-FINNISH BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  HE 
SAID THAT IN HIS PERSONAL OPINION, STALIN HAD MADE A 
MISTAKE BY INVADING FINLAND DURING THE WINTER WAR. 
\"RUSSIA HAD ENOUGH TERRITORY AND DIDN\'T NEED MORE TO 
DEFEND ITSELF.\"  BUT NONETHELESS, IN HIS VIEW, WHAT WAS 
DONE WAS DONE AND THE TERRITORIAL BORDER BETWEEN 
FINLAND AND RUSSIA COULD NOT NOW BE UNDONE.  HE 
EXPLICITLY LINKED THE STATUS OF KARELIA TO THE 
SITUATION OF THE JAPANESE NORTHERN TERRITORIES AND 
ADDUCED THAT DISPUTE AS THE MAIN REASON WHY RUSSIA 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUBJECT: FINNISH PRESIDENT HALONEN\'S JUNE 7 
MEETING WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN 
 
COULD NOT NOW LOOK AT ANY ADJUSTMENT WITH FINLAND. 
 
7. (C) HALONEN SAID THAT HER POSITION ON THE ISSUE WAS 
CLEAR: SHE DID NOT ADVOCATE REOPENINQ THE KARELIA 
QUESTION.  FINNISH VOTERS KNEW THAT WHEN THEY ELECTED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        HELSIN  02613  02 OF 02  121416Z 
HER.  STILL, SHE COULD NOT PREVENT OTHER FINNS FROM 
EXPRESSING THEIR VIEWS.  PUTIN SAID HE HAD NO INTENTION 
OF RAISING THE ISSUE IN PUBLIC.  IN THE EVENT, IT WAS 
THE ONE QUESTION THAT THE FINNISH PRESS RAISED DURING 
THE PRESIDENTS\' JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE.  PUTIN, WHO WAS 
SURPRISED, PERHAPS EVEN SHOCKED, BY THE QUESTION, GAVE 
A RESPONSE WHICH KALELA CHARACTERIZED AS \"QUITE TOUGH, 
EVEN BRUTAL.\"  (THE FINNISH PRESS REPORTED THAT PUTIN 
SAID RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND FINLAND HAD BEEN 
QUITE GOOD FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS BUT THAT A DISCUSSION 
OF KARELIA COULD \"DESTROY\" THOSE GOOD RELATIONS.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
HALONEN DISMISSES PUTIN\'S JUSTIFICATION FOR FORCE IN 
CHECHNYA 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
8. (C) PUTIN REPEATEDLY BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION BACK 
TO CHECHNYA, ARGUING THAT \"YOU FINNS DEFENDED 
YOURSELVES DURING THE WINTER WAR.  WHY DON\'T WE 
RUSSIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST 
TERRORISM IN CHECHNYA?\"  HALONEN\'S RESPONSE WAS VERY 
DIRECT. \"I JUST DON\'T BUY THAT LINE OF ARGUMENT,\" SHE 
REPORTEDLY TOLD PUTIN. 
 
--------------------------------- 
PUTIN CRUDELY ATTACKS THE BALTICS 
--------------------------------- 
9. (C) ACCORDING TO NYBERG, PUTIN ATTACKED THE BALTICS, 
DRAWING ON FAR-FETCHED CLAIMS AND OUTRIGHT LIES.  PUTIN 
SAID THAT THE ESTONIANS \"WERE STILL MAKING TERRITORIAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        HELSIN  02613  02 OF 02  121416Z 
CLAIMS AGAINST RUSSIA.\" HE ACCUSED THE BALTICS OF 
BLATANT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE RUSSIAN SPEAKING 
MINORITIES.  PUTIN ASKED, \"DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR THE 
BALTICS TO DRIVE OUT THE RUSSIAN POPULATION ONLY TO 
MAKE ROOM (PRESUMABLY WHEN IN THE EU) FOR KURD AND 
ALBANIAN REFUGEES?\" 
 
10. (C) HALONEN TOLD PUTIN THAT BOTH FINLAND AND THE EU 
TAKE SERIOUSLY THE PRINCIPLE OF FAIR TREATMENT FOR 
MINORITIES, ESPECIALLY IN EU COUNTRIES AND PROSPECTIVE 
EU MEMBERS.  TO UNDERLINE THIS, SHE ALLUDED TO THE 
SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH THE EU-14 HAD VIEWED THE 
PARTICIPATION OF THE FREEDOM PARTY IN THE AUSTRIAN 
GOVERNMENT -- AN EU MEMBER.  HALONEN NOTED THAT THE 
BALTICS WERE COMPLYINQ WITH OSCE RECOMMENDATIONS 
REGARDINQ SOCIAL INTEGRATION AND THAT FINLAND WAS 
CONTINUING TO HELP THESE COUNTRIES PREPARE FOR EU 
MEMBERSHIP AND ESPECIALLY IN HELPING BUILD UP RULE OF 
LAW.  RESPONDING TO PUTIN\'S STATEMENT ABOUT ESTONIA\'S 
\"TERRITORIAL CLAIMS,\" SHE REMINDED HIM THAT ALREADY 
DURING PRIMAKOV\'S TENURE, PRIMAKOV HAD ASKED HER AS 
THEN FOREIQN MINISTER TO FACILITATE THE TALKS ON A 
BORDER TREATY BETWEEN ESTONIA AND RUSSIA. 
 
---------------------- 
PUTIN POLEMICAL ON NMO 
---------------------- 
 
11. (C) KALELA SAID THAT DURINQ THE KREMLIN DINNER HE 
SAT NEXT TO FM IVANOV, WHO BRIEFED HIM ON THE CLINTON- 
PUTIN SUMMIT IN ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TERMS THAT THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        HELSIN  02613  02 OF 02  121416Z 
AMBASSADOR HAD BRIEFED KALELA AND VALTASAARI BEFORE 
THEIR TRIP TO MOSCOW.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE HAD BEEN 
THAT IVANOV WAS VERY UPBEAT AND OPTIMISTIC, RATHER THAN 
STRICTLY FACTUAL IN HIS BRIEFING.  PUTIN\'S CONVERSATION 
WITH HALONEN ON THE SUBJECT AT DINNER WAS SLIGHTLY MORE 
\"POLEMICAL.\"  IN DISCUSSING NMO HE HAD TAKEN AN ALMOST 
THREATENING TONE, SAYING THAT AN AMERICAN DEPLOYMENT 
COULD CAUSE A \"NEW ARMS RACE.\"  HE HAD NONETHELESS 
EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE SUMMIT MEETING WITH 
POTUS AND SAID HIS RELATIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT WERE 
\"QUITE GOOD.\" 
 
---------------------------------- 
PUTIN\'S GRASP OF ISSUES IMPRESSIVE 
---------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) ALL OF THE FINNS WERE QUITE IMPRESSED BY THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUTIN AND YELTSIN.  PUTIN WAS VERY 
MUCH ON TOP OF HIS BRIEF.  HE SPOKE FLUENTLY AND 
LUCIDLY WITHOUT ANY NOTES.  STATE SECRETARY VALTASAARI 
NOTED THAT PUTIN WAS ABLE TO NAME ALL 26 FINNISH- 
RUSSIAN BORDER CROSSINQS (INCLUDINQ THE 4 UNDER 
CONSTRUCTION) WHICH EVEN THE FINNS COULD NOT HAVE DONE 
WITHOUT NOTES.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES IRAQ WITH PRESIDENT HALONEN 
 
REF: HELSINKI 248 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POL CHIEF JOHN HALL, REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) ON MARCH 4 THE AMBASSADOR CALLED ON PRESIDENT HALONEN 
FOR A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF ISSUES ON THE INTERNATIONAL AND 
BILATERAL AGENDA.  IRAQ WAS THE CHIEF TOPIC.  THE AMBASSADOR 
BEGAN BY THANKING THE PRESIDENT FOR HER RECENT FIRM PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESOLVING THE CRISIS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        HELSIN  00262  071504Z 
LIES WITH SADDAM, NOT WITH THE UN, THE U.S., OR OTHERS. 
 
2. (C) THE PRESIDENT REITERATED HER BELIEF THAT IRAQI 
COMPLIANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS IS THE KEY TO THE PROBLEM. 
AT THE SAME TIME, SHE STRESSED THAT THE MAJORITY OF FINNS 
OPPOSE DISARMING SADDAM BY FORCE.  AN ANTI-WAR PETITION 
SIGNED BY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD BEEN DELIVERED TO THE 
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE DURING THE DAY-LONG DEMONSTRATIONS 
FEBRUARY 15.  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED FINLAND ON BEING A 
COUNTRY THAT WELCOMES DISSENT -- AND CONGRATULATED THE FINNS 
ON THEIR ABILITY TO DISSENT IN AN ORDERLY WAY.  THE PRESIDENT 
LAUGHED, \"YES, WE FINNS ARE ORDERLY.\" 
 
3. (C) HALONEN ALSO VOICED FINNISH CONCERN ABOUT THE 
AFTERMATH OF A CONFLICT, ESPECIALLY ITS EFFECT ON THE 
DEVELOPING NATIONS OF THE REGION.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REACH OUT TO NATIONS WHERE POVERTY IS 
RAMPANT -- WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE CONNECTIONS.  THE 
PRESIDENT ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE 
POLITICAL STRUCTURES OF NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, EMPHASIZING 
THAT SHE WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT IRAN.  (SHE SEEMED TO BE 
REFERRING IN PARTICULAR TO SAUDI ARABIA.)  THE AMBASSADOR 
SAID THE UNITED STATES IS EQUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ECONOMIC 
AND POLITICAL STABILITY, BOTH WITHIN IRAQ AND IN THE REGION, 
AND WAS COMMITTED TO A VISION OF A FUTURE OF HOPE FOR ALL OF 
THE MIDDLE EAST.  IN THIS CONNECTION, WE APPRECIATE FINLAND\'S 
PUBLICLY-STATED WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN RECONSTRUCTION 
IN IRAQ, WITH HUMANITARIAN AID AND PEACEKEEPERS. 
 
4. (C) THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHETHER THE AMBASSADOR THOUGHT A 
CONFLICT WAS INEVITABLE.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE HAD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        HELSIN  00262  071504Z 
OBSERVED THAT DIPLOMATS OFTEN ANSWER A QUESTION WITH A 
QUESTION.  FOLLOWING THAT MODEL, SHE ASKED WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT THOUGHT SADDAM HAD ANY INTENTION OF FULLY 
DISARMING.  IT SEEMS HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF: IF HE DID 
NOT HONOR THE FIRST UNSC RESOLUTION ON IRAQ, WHAT IS THE 
CHANCE THAT HE WILL HONOR THE EIGHTEENTH? 
 
5. (C) THE PRESIDENT AND THE AMBASSADOR ALSO BRIEFLY 
DISCUSSED HALONEN\'S BUSY SCHEDULE OF INTERNATIONAL VISITS 
OVER THE PAST YEAR.  PRESIDENT HALONEN SAID AGAIN HOW MUCH 
SHE APPRECIATED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MEETING WITH HER LAST APRIL, 
AND THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HELPING ARRANGE THE VISIT, 
ALONG WITH CALLS ON JUSTICE O\'CONNOR AND SENATOR HELMS.  IT 
IS CLEAR HALONEN IS ALSO STILL THINKING ABOUT HER VISIT TO 
CHINA LAST NOVEMBER.  SHE SAID THAT FOR MANY NATIONS THE 
FUTURE LIES IN WORKING WITH CHINA.  STILL THERE REMAINS MUCH 
FOR THE CHINESE TO DO IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS FIELD.  SHE NOTED 
THAT SHE HAD BEEN CRITICIZED FOR NOT TAKING A STRONGER STANCE 
ON THIS ISSUE DURING HER VISIT.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE SAME 
APPLIES TO IRAQ -- WHO HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE?  WHERE IS THE INTERNATIONAL 
OUTRAGE OVER THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY SADDAM AGAINST HIS 
OWN PEOPLE? 
 
6. (C) COMMENT: WE ARE STRUCK BY HOW MUCH MORE MODERATE 
PRESIDENT HALONEN\'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS ARE TODAY THAN EVEN TWO 
YEARS AGO.  ALTHOUGH FINLAND REMAINS A NON-ALIGNED NATION -- 
AND MANY FINNS REMAIN OUTRIGHT PACIFISTS -- HALONEN HAS MADE 
CLEAR IN A HIGH-PROFILE WAY HER VIEW THAT THE HEAT MUST BE 
KEPT ON SADDAM.  IN DECEMBER SHE AND PM LIPPONEN TOGETHER 
APPROVED FINLAND\'S PUBLIC COMMITMENT TO AIDING IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        HELSIN  00262  071504Z 
POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ, AT A TIME WHEN NOT THAT 
MANY NATIONS HAD COME FORWARD WITH SUCH A COMMITMENT.  TO 
SOME EXTENT, SHE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO CLOSE RANKS WITH 
LIPPONEN, SINCE ELECTIONS ARE  IMMINENT (MARCH 16).  AND 
LIPPONEN HAS INDEED MADE USE OF HER STATEMENTS, ANSWERING 
OPPOSITION CRITICISM OF FINLAND\'S IRAQ STANCE BY SAYING HIS 
GOVERNMEN IS IN LINE WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S POLICY (REFTEL).

REF: HELSINKI 001209 
 
1. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Dr. Leo Michel, INSS, and 
Dr. John Hulsman, Heritage Foundation, visited 
Helsinki for two program days (November 20-21) to 
participate in the Atlantic Council of Finland\'s 
(ACF) major conference on the transatlantic 
security relationship on Nov. 21.  A total of 4 
U.S. speakers (in addition to subject speakers, 
Jeffrey Gedmin from the Aspen Institute in Berlin 
and Michael Mihalka from the Marshall Center) 
expounded and defended the USG\'s approaches to 
dealing with international terrorism, new security 
threats, and multilateral institutions. 
 
2. DATE; FISCAL YEAR, AND QUARTER: Nov. 20-21, 
2003; FY-04, 1st QUARTER 
 
3. JUSTIFICATION AND OBJECTIVE: to address mutual 
understanding and transatlantic security 
 
4. MPP THEME: Mutual Understanding; Transatlantic 
Relations 
 
5. AUDIENCE: Finland\'s key decision-makers, 
government officials, politicians, historians, 
business and cultural leaders, university faculty 
and students 
 
6. RESULT/IMPACT: 
 
During their 2-day visit, the speakers also met 
with advanced students at the National Defence 
College of Finland, gave several tv and print 
interviews (commenting on the vital need for a 
global response to terrorism and, in the context of 
the recent bombings, Turkey\'s continuing 
integration into the West), briefed 
parliamentarians and defense officials, and debated 
further with key international relations experts at 
representational events. While not all Finnish 
interlocutors were persuaded that the U.S. is 
committed to multilateralism, they were impressed 
by the substantive and realistic, rather than 
ideological, positions presented by the American 
speakers.  The ACF conference advanced the 
discussion about Finland\'s evolving security 
relationships, including possible NATO membership, 
at a time when Finland is exploring new responses 
to challenges in its upcoming white paper on 
defense.

invitations to lectures (jointly with other

     B. STATE 152813 
     C. HELSINKI 860 
 
Classified By: LABOFF David A. Schlaefer for Reasons 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
1. (C) As reported in Ref C, almost all official contact 
between Finland and Cuba has ceased, and Finland does not 
maintain an embassy in Havana. 
 
2. (C) We are not aware of any current activity by the 
Finnish Government, or by Finnish NGOs, to support elements 
of Cuban civil society and encourage democratic change.  Nor 
are we aware of any efforts by Finnish labor unions to 
advance labor rights in Cuba.  Since receipt of Refs A and B, 
we have made some discreet inquiries, and turned up no 
evidence of any actions under way in this area. 
Nevertheless, Finnish officials have said that the GoF policy 
toward Cuba is based on \"encouragement of peaceful transition 
to pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights.\" 
These are not empty words -- human rights concerns are a 
major factor in Finland\'s foreign policy.  On the other hand, 
the Finns have a strong preference for multilateral action in 
most issues, via the EU if possible and in any case the more 
broadly-based the better.  We therefore believe that the 
Finnish government and Finnish NGOs would be interested in 
principle in international efforts to assist democratic 
change in Cuba, but would not want to lead such an effort. 
 
3. (C) The Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions, or 
SAK, is Finland\'s largest trade union confederation.  It 
participates in the work of the ILO and belongs to the ICFTU 
and the OECD\'s Trade Union Advisory Council.  Its 
international activities include promotion of worker rights, 
in areas ranging from Russia and the Baltics to South 
America, Asia, and Africa.  The SAK may be interested in an 
international effort in labor fora to press Cuba to end labor 
rights violations, but again, we believe they would look for 
the broadest coalition of partners possible before joining 
and would be unlikely to take the lead in forming such a 
coalition.

said that there was obviously a need for a \"buffer\" between 
UN civilian personnel and Coalition military operations.  She 
opined that using American and British forces to protect UN 
assets invited attacks by insurgents and was not the ideal 
solution to UN security needs.  However, she stopped short of 
endorsing the concept outlined in reftel and said that the 
Finnish government would have to seriously consider the issue 
before giving any official reaction. 
 
3.  (C)  Riitola told Poloff that Finland\'s Foreign Minister, 
Tuomioja, was returning from vacation at the end of the week, 
and would be meeting with President Halonen for an \"informal 
review\" of pressing foreign policy issues that had arisen 
during Finland\'s unofficial summer break.  Riitola said that 
she would pass the information to the Political Secretariat 
and Foreign Minister\'s Office, and see that the force 
protection issue was on the agenda for the Halonen/Tuomioja 
meeting. To reinforce our message before that review, 
Ambassador Mack met with Under Secretary of State for 
Political Affairs Jaakko Laajava and Acting Political DG Anu 
Lammanen Ryter on August 5.  The Ambassador emphasized that 
an early expression of support for the UN protection force by 
Finland could be critical to galvanizing the necessary 
support in the international community.  Keying off comments 
made by President Halonen last week that Muslim troops were 
the best hope for stabilizing Iraq, the Ambassador stressed 
that the force contemplated in reftel would consist primarily 
of Muslim troops and be less likely to be attacked by Muslim 
insurgents and terrorists.  The Ambassador cited Finland\'s 
long-standing, strong support for the United Nations and 
multilateralism, and also noted recent press remarks by UNSYG 
Annan stating that plans for full UN re-engagement in Iraq 
are in jeopardy because of lack of support on the force 
protection issue. 
 
4.  (C)  Laajava agreed that a solution to the UN force 
protection issue was necessary.  He said that it was often 
easy to \"miss the forest for the trees,\" and that whatever 
policy differences existed with the U.S. as regards Iraq, it 
was in everyone\'s interest to now assist in helping to build 
a stable and safe country for the Iraqi people.  Laajava 
mentioned that Annan had been in Finland (and was in a 
meeting with President Halonen) when he was informed of the 
tragic attack on UN headquarters earlier this year.  He noted 
that former Finnish President Ahtisaari had led the inquiry 
into the attack, and many of the recommendations in 
Ahtisaari\'s report seemed to inform the UN force protection 
concept that was now being discussed.  However, Laajava also 
said that since the operation envisioned was not a \"blue 
helmet\" operation, both politics and logistics could be more 
complicated.  Laajava said that he would be participating in 
the \"informal review\" of foreign policy later that very day, 
and would fully discuss the issue with Tuomioja and Halonen. 
He also had several questions about the mechanics of the 
operation. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  There is currently an ongoing debate in 
the Finnish press about how Finland should reconcile its 
commitment to the UN and multilateralism with the aversion 
both the GoF and Finnish society have as regards the Iraq 
conflict.  While the GoF has publicly emphasized that lack of 
resources makes any consideration of Finnish troop deployment 
impossible, some editorials have questioned whether that 
position is morally sustainable, and whether Finnish lives 
are \"worth more\" than the lives of would-be peacekeepers from 
the developing world.  Given that, the reaction of the MFA\'s 
working level to the current demarche suggests they see 
financing a UN protection force as an opportunity for Finland 
to fulfill moral and political obligations to the UN without 
becoming involved in actual ground operations.  Whether 
Tuomioja agrees with this assessment remains to be seen. 
Tuomioja\'s support alone may not be sufficient to secure a 
positive response from Finland, but his opposition will 
almost certainly make the idea a political non-starter here. 
 
6.  (C)  Action request:  The GoF has requested the following 
information pursuant to its internal debate over third party 
financing on UN force protection in Iraq: 
 
--  What are Iraq\'s neighbors, especially Saudi Arabia, doing 
in regard to UN force protection? 
 
--  Why is the U.S. making this appeal rather than a direct 
approach from the UNSYG? 
 
--  What criteria were used to determine which countries 
would be approached? 
 
--  Who will command the UN protection force? 
 
--  What will the force\'s relationship be to the coalition 
and what precisely will its function be? 
 
--  What is the attitude of the IIG to this idea? 
 
--  Why is this not officially a \"blue helmet\" operation, 
since that would seem to facilitate both financial and troop 
donations?

provided to the CPA in support of their claim(s) to Finnish 
residency were over ten years old and did not transfer

     B. PRISTINA 951 
 
Classified By: ACTING POL CHIEF DAVID ALLEN SCHLAEFER FOR REASONS 1.4 ( 
B) and (D) 
 
1. (C) According to the Finnish Defense Forces (FDF), Finland 
has the following national caveats on the use of Finnish 
troops in Kosovo: 
 
-- No use of lethal force to protect property.  (This caveat 
and the next do not affect the peacekeeper\'s right to 
self-defense.) 
 
-- No use of lethal force to prevent a detained person from 
escaping. 
 
-- No use of riot control weapons, including tear gas, water 
cannons, or rubber bullets. 
 
-- No use of Finnish forces outside the KFOR area of 
operations. 
 
2. (C) In a conversation with the FDF International Division, 
Embassy Helsinki DATT was told that the FDF has proposed to 
the Ministry of Defense that the latter two caveats be 
lifted.  The third was written into Finnish deployment orders 
some years ago, when it was assumed that soldiers would not 
be involved in riot control actions.  Now the Finns realize 
the situation has changed, said our source.  Nevertheless, 
MoD lawyers are currently examining the use of tear gas to be 
sure that it is consistent with Finland\'s obligations under 
the Chemical Weapons treaty. 
 
3. (C) In a July 29 conversation with Klaus Korhonen, MFA 
Acting Political Director, and Mikko Kinnunen, Acting Chief 
of the Security Policy Unit, POL Chief urged the MFA to throw 
its weight behind the lifting of all four caveats.  POL Chief 
stressed that this recommendation is the result of the NATO 
study of lessons learned from the tragic violence of last 
March -- when former Finnish PM Holkeri was head of UNMIK. 
We underlined that the first caveat is not a theoretical 
issue, since attacks on patrimonial sites, or on the homes of 
minority groups, have been major contributors to past 
violence.  Korhonen said he understood, but said MFA would 
need to discuss the caveats with its own legal staff, since 
\"the principles, traditions, and practices on which (these 
limitations) may be based\" have to be addressed. 
 
4.  (C) On August 2, Acting Defense Attache presented a 
parallel demarche to Dr. Pauli Jarvenpaa, MoD DG for Defense 
Policy, and third-ranking official at the Ministry. Jarvenpaa 
said that in response to past incidents in Kosovo, Finnish 
Defense Forces (FDF) legal staff had prepared a document 
addressing the caveats issue; this document is currently 
being studied by MoD. Jarvenpaa opined that use of legal 
force to protect property and to prevent a detained person 
from escaping are the thorniest caveats for the Finns.  He 
said that the Finns will find some sort of work-around on the 
use of riot control weapons  (e.g., use of water cannons) so 
as to avoid violating NBC chemical weapons conventions. He 
further believed that the Finns would relax restrictions 
allowing their troops to operate outside the KFOR area of 
operations. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) The Finns remain committed to non-alignment, and are 
proud of the current and past role they have played in 
nonviolent dispute resolution and peacekeeping.  That said, 
their attitude toward security issues also reflects their 
highly pragmatic side.  As a nation they are proud of -- and 
comfortable with -- their close relationship with NATO and 
the fact that they were the first non-NATO country to lead a 
regional unit within KFOR.  We assume that the question of 
caveats has been discussed with the Finns within NATO 
channels; to induce some change in the first caveat may 
require a very high-level presentation -- such as an early 
SACEUR demarche to ADM Kaskeala, the Finnish CHOD.  The 
timing of this demarche is important.  If countervailing 
views favoring restrictive caveats have time to harden, 
Kaskeala will have a more difficult time influencing the 
desired outcome.

1.  (C)  Per reftel instructions, Pol Chief and Poloff 
demarched Tuula Yrjola, the desk officer for Ukraine, and 
Terhi Hakala, Director on the Unit for East Europe and 
Central Asia, about the need for additional election 
observers in Ukraine during upcoming elections.  Poloffs 
noted the interest Finland had expressed at the last e-PINE 
PolDirs\' meeting about democratization in Ukraine, and 
stressed that this was an excellent opportunity to use the 
e-PINE framework to advance our shared agenda in Kiev. 
Hakala agreed, and said that Finland was prepared to commit 
up to 4 election observers for the October first-round and 
November run-off elections.  She said that it would be 
difficult to commit more than 4 since Finland had also been 
asked to send observers to Minsk to cover Belorussian 
elections during the same time period.  However, Hakala said 
that Finland was extremely interested in what happens in 
Ukraine and would consider sending additional observers if 
possible. 
 
2.  (C)  Hakala and Yrjola also shared their views about the 
upcoming Ukrainian elections.  Hakala opined that while it 
was unrealistic to hold out hope for \"fair and free\" 
elections in Ukraine now, the GoF was at least looking for 
progress toward that goal.  She said the Finns take every 
opportunity they can to stress to the Ukrainian government 
the need for democratic reform.  She said that Finnish 
observers would be monitoring issues such as the incidence of 
ballot stuffing, how much pressure there was on voters at 
polling precincts to select certain candidates, and how much 
pressure was put on the media (and the media\'s reaction) to 
slant coverage of the candidates.  Hakala said that it was 
still unclear which of the two leading candidates would 
likely win the election, although Yanukovych was clearly 
Putin\'s choice, and this gave him a marked advantage.  Both 
Hakala and Yrjola said that a Yanoukovych victory would lead 
to a realignment in the power balance among Ukraine\'s 
organized crime/business \"clans,\" and also likely lead to a 
change in Ukraine\'s policy toward the EU. 
 
3.  (C)  Yrjola said that the Ukrainian foreign minister 
might visit Helsinki shortly before the October 14 e-PINE 
meeting in Washington, and that the visit might profitably 
inform the e-PINE discussion of Ukraine.  Asked if she 
thought there were any Ukraine-related projects that might 
benefit from discussion under the e-PINE umbrella, Hakala 
said that GoF wants to pay more attention to freedom of the 
media, and plans to invite Ukrainian journalists to Helsinki 
to learn some fundamentals.  She said that it might be useful 
to gather journalists from several FSU nations at once for an 
English-language or Russian-language program.

1. (C) Summary: In an August 27 meeting with the chief of the 
MFA\'s EU coordination unit, we reviewed the agenda for the 
September 3-4 Gymnich meeting.  We were told that the EU is 
leaning toward a financial contribution to support a UN 
protection force in Iraq -- and that Finland would consider 
making a national contribution if EU funds did not 
materialize.  (The GoF made that position official on 
September 1; see septel.)  On other issues, we were told the 
Finns: still favor shifting EU focus from the China arms 
embargo to improving the code of conduct; have no problem 
with giving Turkey a date for beginning accession 
negotiations; support sanctions against Sudan -- if those 
sanctions take into account the concurrent need to end 
Sudan\'s civil war; agree pressure must be kept on Iran; feel 
Ambassador Eide\'s recommendations on Kosovo make sense but 
may be hard to implement; and support the Sharon plan for 
Gaza withdrawal -- as long as it is not Gaza first and last. 
Our exchange on Burma/ASEM is reported in Ref E; the Finns 
seem still inclined to accept a lower-level Burmese presence 
at the summit.  End Summary 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
2. (C) On August 27 POL Chief and PolOff met with Kimmo 
Lahdevirta, chief of MFA\'s EU coordination unit, to review 
issues likely to be raised at the Foreign Ministers\' upcoming 
Gymnich meeting.  Lahdevirta said that in addition to the 
topics mentioned in Ref A, the ministers\' agenda includes 
Iraq and Middle East peace negotiations. 
 
3. (C) We asked whether the EU had come to any decision on 
the request that the European Union contribute financially to 
cover certain costs for countries that provide troops for a 
UN protection force (Refs B, C).  Lahdevirta said that the 
question had been discussed at that week\'s meeting of the 
PSC, and his understanding was the participants were \"fairly 
unanimous\" that the EU should provide some money (he did not 
say how much) from EU common funds to support this 
initiative.  He said that the FMs will take up the matter at 
the Gymnich, but in the meantime, the Commission has been 
tasked with finding the money to do this. 
 
4. (C) Lahdevirta added that Finland prefers the idea of the 
EU contributing as a group, rather than some individual 
members providing national funds.  But if EU funding does not 
materialize, he said, Finland \"would be willing to consider\" 
making a national contribution.  (Note: On September 1, the 
GoF reported formally to us, and to its fellow EU members, 
that this is Finland\'s position.  See septel for further 
details.) 
 
China Arms Embargo 
------------------ 
 
5. (C) We argued, as we have in past conversations with the 
GoF, that the government of China would portray lifting of 
the embargo as an endorsement of China\'s recent human rights 
record, an endorsement China certainly does not deserve. 
Lahdevirta said the Finns understand and agree that the 
Chinese human rights record is \"very problematic.\" 
Nevertheless, the GoF still believes the most productive 
course would be to shift attention to the EU code of conduct, 
tighten it so that it more effectively controls 
high-technology items not covered by the arms embargo, and 
bring it into the EU\'s body of codified, binding legislation. 
 (Septel reports on a subsequent, more detailed conversation 
with nonproliferation chief and PolDir-designate 
Vierros-Villeneuve.) 
 
Turkey and the EU 
----------------- 
 
6. (C) Lahdevirta said that Finland (during whose 1999 EU 
presidency Turkey became a formal candidate for EU 
membership) has no problem with Turkey being given a date for 
the beginning of accession negotiations.  He added that the 
GoF has been \"very disappointed\" with the Greek Cypriots\' 
reaction to the decision to widen contacts with Northern 
Cyprus. 
 
Sudan/Darfur 
------------ 
 
7. (C) Lahdevirta said Finland is prepared to consider 
sanctions against the Government of Sudan, but reiterated 
that those sanctions must take into account the ongoing and 
separate need to foster peaceful resolution of the 
government/SPLA civil war.  (See Ref D and previous.) 
Iran 
---- 
 
8. (C) The GoF is \"waiting eagerly\" for the UK/French/German 
report, but certainly agrees that the EU must be part of the 
international pressure on Iran to cooperate fully with the 
IAEA and to suspend all its enrichment-related and 
reprocessing activities. 
 
Kosovo 
------ 
 
9. (C) Lahdevirta described NATO PermRep Eide\'s recent report 
to the UNSYG as \"very critical and his recommendations very 
harsh -- but they may be necessary.  The question is how to 
implement them.\"  The report, he said, contains ideas that 
make sense, but are more easily said than done.  On the issue 
of Belgrade\'s interests in Kosovo, Lahdevirta remarked that 
Kosovo Serbs have a legitimate fear of being marginalized or 
cantonized.  They must be able to feel that they have a 
future. 
 
Middle East 
----------- 
 
10. (C) The EU will do what it can to support PM Sharon\'s 
Gaza withdrawal plan, said Lahdevirta, but with the 
understanding that it cannot be Gaza first and last.

Classified By: Ambassador Earle I. Mack for Reasons 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
1. (C) I spoke today with Jaakko Kalela, President Halonen\'s 
chief of staff.  I noted news reports over the past few days 
that a cache of weapons, mostly handguns, had been seized in 
Finland.  Just today Finnish customs officials have reported 
that these weapons were transiting Finland, from China to 
Estonia.  I told Kalela that if the EU\'s China Arms Embargo 
were lifted, with a consequent increase in the arms trade 
with China, we might very well see more such incidents.  I 
also stressed the negative effect lifting the embargo would 
have on regional stability in East Asia, especially if 
tensions increase in the run-up to Taiwan\'s elections. 
Lifting the embargo now would be seen as a validation of 
China\'s human rights policy, or at least a sign that the EU 
believes the policy is headed in the right direction. 
 
2. (C) Kalela told me he agreed conceptually with the points 
I had made.  He said, however, that the Finns believe the 
embargo has become outmoded, and something updated should 
take its place.  I replied that we do not believe the 1998 
Code of Conduct is enforceable, and do not believe it could 
be made effective.  I underlined that lifting the embargo 
would evoke a very negative reaction in the U.S., including 
on the Hill.  Kalela assured me he does not want to see a 
strain of that sort in the trans-Atlantic relationship.  In 
any case, he said, he did not think any substantive action 
would take place at the upcoming GAERC meeting.  He assumes 
the Ministers will defer this for later action. 
 
3. (C) I mentioned my conversation with Under Secretary 
Laajava (Ref A); Kalela said he was aware of it.  I used that 
opportunity to mention that Laajava had suggested a call from 
the Secretary to President Halonen may help make the case for 
retaining the embargo.  I asked Kalela for his advice 
regarding such a call.  I said we would not want to embarrass 
President Halonen by putting her in a position where she 
would be uncomfortable with the call.  Kalela in response was 
a bit more positive than Laajava, who had been a touch 
guarded about the merits of such a call.  Kalela said he 
thought a call from the Secretary would be well received, 
although -- like Laajava -- he did not want to guarantee that 
it would change Finnish views. 
 
4. (C) We still have the sense that the Finns would prefer to 
see the embargo lifted, but would not take the lead for doing 
so.  There have been times in the past, however (such as the 
ICC debate in 2002), when they have been strong advocates 
within the EU for working with the U.S. to find an outcome 
acceptable to all.  It might be worthwhile for the Secretary 
to telephone Tarja Halonen and ask for her assistance in this 
case.

1. (C) Summary:  On October 7 Assistant Secretary for Arms 
Control Stephen Rademaker and AC Special Advisor Paul 
Janiczek, en route back to Washington from a visit to Moscow 
(reftel), stopped in Helsinki for consultations with the 
Finnish government.  In separate meetings with the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense, Rademaker urged 
the Finns to support the new U.S. initiative for a global ban 
on the sale or export of all persistent landmines.  He also 
made the case for negotiating such a ban in the CD, rather 
than the CCW.  At both ministries, officials said they saw no 
reason for Finland to object to such a ban.  Finnish 
officials briefed the Assistant Secretary on the GoF decision 
to sign the Ottawa Convention in 2012 and eliminate all 
anti-personnel landmines (APLs) by 2016.  The Finns asked for 
Rademaker\'s views on recent development in Russia, and 
expressed concern over \"hardline trends\", although they said 
the Finnish-Russian bilateral relationship remains on track. 
MFA officials also sought U.S. views on a wide range of other 
issues, including the CTBT, NPT, and BWC.  End Summary. 
 
The U.S. Landmine Initiative 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) A/S Rademaker and Special Advisor Janiczek spoke first 
with MoD officials, including LGEN (ret) Matti Ahola, the 
ministry\'s second-ranking official, Director General for 
Resource Policy Eero Lavonen, Deputy DG for Defense Policy 
Olli-Pekka Jalonen, and Senior Advisor Taina Susiluota, the 
Ministry\'s chief civilian expert on landmines.  At the MFA, 
the visitors met with Under Secretary for Political Affairs 
Jaakko Laajava, Political Director Markus Lyra, Arms Control 
director Pilvi-Sisko Vierros-Villeneuve, and Laura 
Kansikas-Debraise, who has the landmine portfolio.  The 
visitors were accompanied by DATT to the first meeting, and 
by POL chief to both meetings. 
 
3. (C) In his conversations with both MFA and MoD, Assistant 
Secretary Rademaker recalled the close cooperation between 
 
SIPDIS 
the U.S. and Finnish governments on landmines, cooperation 
that continues today in the CCW in Geneva, where Finnish 
Ambassador Reimaa has been a valued partner.  Bearing that 
cooperation in mind, the Assistant Secretary hoped the GoF 
would be able to support the new U.S. initiative for a global 
ban on the transfer of persistent landmines, covering both 
anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines. 
 
4. (C) Rademaker said we share the concern over the 
humanitarian effects of landmines that motivated the framers 
of the Ottawa Convention.  This is evidenced by our support 
for demining efforts worldwide, in which we invest a great 
deal more than most Ottawa Convention signatories.  The 
Convention is one solution to these humanitarian concerns, 
but it is not the best solution, since it does not cover 
anti-vehicle mines -- which can have anti-handling devices 
that are equivalent to APLs and which therefore present just 
as great a challenge.  The U.S. is now confident enough of 
self-destructing/self-deactivating (SD/SDA) technology that 
we have committed to eliminate all persistent landmines from 
our inventory by 2010.  There are several advantages to doing 
so: the obvious humanitarian benefit; elimination of the 
costly need to clear minefields after conflicts; and the fact 
that given the highly mobile nature of modern warfare, U.S. 
forces might have to pass through areas that we ourselves 
once had mined. 
 
5. (C) The Assistant Secretary noted that over the years 
persistent landmines have been transferred to Angola, 
Afghanistan, Cambodia, and many other nations.  The U.S. 
proposes an international treaty prohibiting the sale or 
export of such mines -- although there should be an exception 
for SD/SDA mines, to allow countries with persistent mines to 
replace them with the new technology.  \"The Ottawa Convention 
missed the point.  It\'s not the existence of landmines in 
warehouses that\'s killing people, it\'s the fact that they\'re 
persistent.  And it\'s their indiscriminate export that is 
the problem.\" 
 
6. (C) Rademaker said that one issue yet to be decided is 
where to negotiate such a ban.  The U.S. knows Ambassador 
Reimaa favors doing so in the CCW, but we prefer the 
Conference on Disarmament, for several reasons.  First, the 
CCW is fundamentally about the law of war, not arms control. 
Second, the CD has not been engaged in productive work on any 
subject for some time; this must end if its continued 
existence is to be justified.  And finally, introducing into 
the CCW a proposed ban on the sale/export of anti-personnel 
and anti-vehicle mines, in addition to the anti-vehicle 
landmine (AVL) initiative already pending there, would so 
complicate matters that it would likely ensure no progress is 
made on either initiative. 
 
7. (C) In response, MFA Under Secretary Laajava said ruefully 
that the entire issue \"is a real minefield for us -- we don\'t 
want to overstep into things we can\'t control.\"  He said the 
GoF would need time to consider the U.S. initiative. 
Nevertheless, PolDir Markus Lyra said, \"Your ideas sound all 
right to me.\"  Arms Control chief Vierros-Villeneuve noted 
that in the past, the GoF had supported use of the CD.  She 
said that from the substantive point of view the Finns would 
have no problem with negotiation in the CD framework, 
although it would be difficult for Finland to take the lead 
in such negotiations.  She said there are strong feelings in 
the EU that the Ottawa Convention should not be undermined by 
other discussions -- but, she acknowledged, the U.S. 
initiative would be about more than APLs.  In Rademaker\'s MoD 
meeting, Jalonen and Susiluota said that their ministry would 
have no problem with anything in the U.S. proposal -- the 
substance of the initiative presents no difficulty for 
Finland. 
 
8. (C) The Finns asked how the Russians and Chinese have 
responded to the U.S. initiative.  A/S Rademaker said the 
Russians told him they are prepared to begin negotiations on 
a transfer ban -- \"which is huge,\" since much of the 
worldwide humanitarian problem stems from Soviet-manufactured 
mines.  The Russians have not yet agreed to an exception for 
SA/SDA mines, saying this can be addressed in the 
negotiations.  The Russian position on the AVL proposal in 
the CCW is much more negative: they have said they need 
undetectable anti-vehicle mines and will not give them up. 
As for the Chinese, the U.S. has discussed the concept with 
them only in general terms, but their initial reaction was 
not negative. 
 
Finland\'s Landmines 
------------------- 
 
9. (C) Both ministries briefed the Assistant Secretary on 
Finland\'s decision, made in the context of the nation\'s new 
\"white paper\" on security and defense policy, to sign the 
Ottawa Convention in 2012 and destroy its APLs by 2016.  At 
the same time, anti-vehicle mines will be retained 
indefinitely.  LGEN Ahola said landmines are a vital part of 
the territorial defense; referring to the two wars fought 
with the Soviet Union in the 1940s, he said there are tens of 
thousands of veterans alive today thanks to landmines.  The 
Finnish public supports their retention \"as long as things in 
Russia are uncertain.\"  Insofar as the APLs are concerned, 
however, the MoD has been cooperating with the U.S. 
Department of Defense and private U.S. companies in 
determining what systems might be feasible replacements. 
These might include short-range perimeter defense weapons, 
improved anti-vehicle mines, \"intelligent charges with an 
integrated sensor system,\" \"smart ammunition\" for artillery, 
and/or multiple rocket launchers.  To procure such systems, 
the government has pledged to add 200 million euros to the 
MoD budget over the period 2009-16, and the MoD will 
reprogram a further 111 M euros of its current budget. 
 
10. (C) MFA Under Secretary Laajava said that although the 
white paper covered a lot of ground, the Finnish parliament 
in its review of the document has concentrated on two 
subjects: a proposal for base closings and the APL decision. 
Although some MPs feel the government\'s timetable is too 
hasty and some not hasty enough, both MoD and MFA expect the 
GoF decision to hold.  In the meantime, said 
Vierros-Villeneuve, the government is bound by the EU policy 
of promoting the Ottawa Convention.  Laajava recalled that he 
had been Political Director when the Convention was being 
negotiated.  He had been sent to various EU capitals to 
explain the role that APLs play in Finnish defense, and make 
the case for Ottawa-compliant systems.  \"I got zero sympathy. 
 And when Princess Diana got involved, an orderly negotiation 
process turned into a movement.\"  A/S Rademaker agreed that 
support of the Convention has become almost akin to a 
religion.  But religious devotion to one treaty should not be 
allowed to stand in the way of doing something meaningful to 
prevent the indiscriminate export of persistent landmines. 
 
Changes in the Russians 
----------------------- 
 
11. (C) The Assistant Secretary\'s Finnish interlocutors also 
took the opportunity to ask for his views on other issues. 
First and foremost, they sought his assessment of political 
developments in Russia.  LGEN Ahola said the Finns \"know the 
Russian hierarchy well,\" and bilateral conversations are 
continuing without problems for now, \"but we -- including our 
politicians -- are worried about harder-line trends.\" 
Laajava, noting that Rademaker was returning from 
consultations in Moscow, asked for Rademaker\'s sense of the 
overall atmosphere there, because \"we\'re not quite sure.\" 
The Assistant Secretary said that, compared to past trips to 
Moscow, he had found a new atmosphere at the MFA: things the 
U.S. and Russia had talked about in a businesslike way in the 
past were now more contentious, and surveillance during his 
visit was heavy and obvious. 
 
12. (C) Laajava asked if there has been any backtracking from 
previous commitments.  Rademaker said no, although the 
Russians are now less diplomatic in their rejections.  With 
regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention, for example, we 
have concerns regarding the Russian declaration.  For more 
than a year the USG has attempted to gain copies of certain 
documents the Russian government showed the OPCW.  One year 
ago the Russian side agreed to share these documents with the 
U.S., but now they claim that the documents in question have 
been destroyed.  The Assistant Secretary said that in the 
past, the U.S. and Russia could have a civilized dialogue on 
such concerns, and work together to resolve them, but now the 
Russian side seems less willing to cooperate.  He noted that 
the Russians need to be responsive: Congress will not 
find such behavior acceptable, given the amount of money the 
USG spends on assisting the GoR in eliminating its chemical 
stockpiles. 
 
Non-strategic Nuclear Weapons 
----------------------------- 
 
13. (C) A/S Rademaker\'s MFA interlocutors also sought his 
views on a wide range of other topics, beginning with that of 
tactical nuclear weapons.  Rademaker said that the U.S. is 
concerned that Russia has not complied fully with Yeltsin\'s 
undertakings of 1991-92.  NATO, for its part, has reduced its 
tactical nuclear weapons in accordance with the Presidential 
Nuclear Initiatives, and even lower.  PolDir Lyra noted that 
U.S. tactical nuclear weapons nevertheless have not been 
withdrawn totally from Europe.  The Assistant Secretary 
agreed, but said the remaining weapons are in Europe as much 
for the cohesion of the alliance as out of military 
necessity.  He added that there appears to be an argument 
about them within some NATO governments; in Germany, for 
example, the arms control community probably would like to 
see all tactical weapons go, but the German MoD feels they 
guarantee a U.S. nuclear umbrella. 
 
NPT 
--- 
 
14. (C) Under Secretary Laajava asked how the USG assesses 
the state of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  A/S Rademaker 
said a lot will depend on how the next Rev Con goes.  The NPT 
is facing a crisis of compliance.  Are there other nations 
out there that were trading with the A.Q. Khan network, or 
otherwise pursuing nuclear weapons in violation of the NPT? 
In a serious Rev Con, that would be the focus. 
 
CTBT 
---- 
 
15. (C) Under Secretary Laajava said that Finns consider the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty one of the cornerstones of 
their foreign policy.  He had always thought the U.S. would 
be able to find some technical solution that would allow 
ratification of the treaty.  Is that hope now lost?  The 
treaty\'s credibility needs to be preserved, given the 
\"tremendous tasks that lie ahead.\"  A/S Rademaker said that 
treaties require the votes of 2/3 of the Senate, which means 
they must enjoy bipartisan support.  The CTBT does not and 
will not, no matter who wins the U.S. election.  That said, 
the U.S. continues to respect the testing moratorium.  He 
noted rumors that the \"robust nuclear earth penetrator\" will 
require testing, but said that in fact this is planned to be 
an existing weapon placed in an even harder case than the 
Clinton Administration\'s \"nuclear earth penetrator,\" which 
also was deployed without nuclear testing.  Moreover, 
bringing the Nevada test center back online would be very 
expensive.  Nevertheless, the reality is that no man-made 
device lasts forever.  We can envision circumstances 
developing in the future in which it would be very useful to 
us to test.  This ties into the problem of verifying the 
CTBT, which is of central concern to the Senate.  Arguably 
the CTBT might be an acceptable bargain if we were assured no 
one else was violating it, but nuclear testing can take place 
below the seismologists\' ability to detect.  The CTBT clearly 
is not a good bargain for us if we adhere to it and others do 
not. 
 
BWC 
--- 
 
16. (C) Laajava asked about U.S. plans for the next BWC Rev 
Con, which will take place during the Finnish EU presidency, 
in the second half of 2006.  A/S Rademaker said we have only 
started to think about this, since member states are only 
halfway through the work program adopted in 2002.  Overall, 
we are satisfied with the work program, but we continue to be 
dissatisfied with the approach represented by the BWC 
Protocol.  Verification arrangements under the Protocol could 
not be expected to detect cheating, but they could be 
expected to create problems for the biotechnology industry, 
in which patents are hard to achieve and based on very 
sensitive proprietary information.  Here, as in other areas 
like the Ottawa Convention, the Clinton Administration did 
the world no favors by letting a negotiation get to the final 
stages and then pulling away.  We know that many believe the 
Bush Administration walked away from the Protocol just as it 
was about to be signed, but this is not true. 
Vierros-Villeneuve assured Rademaker that Finland is aware of 
this, and Laajava added that he himself had seen it was 
untrue.  Vierros-Villeneuve said the EU agrees the Protocol 
is now part of the past, \"just rhetoric.\"  Nevertheless, 
Laajava said, \"the issue itself is tremendous -- even more so 
because of the terrorist threat.\"  Rademaker agreed that 
advances in biotechnology pose BW risks, although the 
industry overall has produced great benefits. 
 
17. (U) Assistant Secretary Rademaker has cleared this cable.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, TU, FI, EUN 
SUBJECT: FINLAND: SUPPORT FOR TURKISH ACCESSION TO THE EU 
 
 
1.  (U) Several Finnish officials and opinion makers have 
recently expressed support at a variety of fora for eventual 
Turkish accession to the EU.  Such statements mark Finland as 
being among those who support a positive decision as regards 
the Turkish question later this year.  Olli Rehn, the new 
Finnish EU Commissioner for Enlargement, has publicly warned 
opponents of Turkish accession that as the historic decision 
is debated, Turkey\'s application should not be \"pre-judged\" 
but considered on its merits and with the best interests of 
both Turkey and Europe in mind.  The Finnish Government 
clearly supports Rehn\'s attitude.  The three most notable 
examples of Finland\'s proactive policy on Turkey were a 
statement by Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja at an October 13 
\"Turkey and the Borders of Europe Seminar,\" and the remarks 
of Liisa Jaakonsaari, the chair of Finland\'s Parliamentary 
Foreign Affairs Committee, and former President Martti 
Ahtisaari at a Helsinki briefing about the Independent 
Commission on Turkey\'s just-released report. 
 
Support from the Foreign Minister 
--------------------------------- 
2.  (U) Speaking at the aforementioned seminar, Tuomioja 
welcomed the Committee\'s report and stated Finnish support 
for Turkish accession.  The foreign minister noted that 
Turkey had made substantial progress in all outstanding areas 
such as human rights, civil-military relations, and the rule 
of law.  He specifically noted progress on issues like 
capital punishment, gender equality, and the supremacy of 
international agreements.  Tuomioja acknowledged that 
challenges remained.  He said that the continued use of 
torture, violence against women, and concerns over freedom of 
expression remained real problems that Turkey would have to 
overcome as it prepared for accession.  However, he expressed 
confidence that the Turks would meet these challenges and be 
ready within a decade to join the EU.  Countering claims that 
Turkey\'s Islamic culture is incompatible with European 
culture, Tuomioja bluntly said that \"Turkey is part of 
Europe.  Finns share a common identity with the Turks.  Our 
common values, not borders, should be at the center of 
discussion.\" 
 
An Historic Moment is at Hand 
----------------------------- 
3.  (U) Speaking before Finland\'s Parliament and leading 
politicians and ministry officials on Oct. 20, Jaakonsaari 
opined that whatever the price of EU enlargement, it was 
small in comparison with the costs of not bringing Turkey 
into the EU.  Jaakonsaari emphasized the importance of Turkey 
in building bridges to the Muslim world.  She said that the 
process of enlargement and integration might be a long one, 
but that it must continue.  Jaakonsaari recognized that 
Turkey must fulfill its obligation to continue to reform its 
human rights practices, and that there could be no question 
of a \"double-standard\" for human rights within Turkey as 
opposed to the rest of the EU.  However, she believed recent 
progress would continue.  Jaakonsaari said that Turkey\'s 
legislative preparation had been \"excellent,\" and while the 
implementation of this legislation had not always run 
smoothly so far, she was optimistic about the future.  She 
opined that for the EU and Turkey, there could be \"no turning 
back.\" 
 
4.  (U)  Following Jaakonsaari\'s remarks, the head of the 
EU\'s Independent Commission on Turkey, former Finnish 
President Martti Ahtisaari, spoke.  Ahtisaari said that 
Turkey was a part of Europe and always had been.  He noted 
that Turkey was a part of the OSCE, NATO, and virtually every 
other trans-atlantic organization in some capacity.  He 
highlighted Turkey\'s strong economic performance in recent 
years, and cited a long list of successful Turkish human 
rights reforms, including abolition of the death penalty, 
reform of language laws, increased guarantees on religious 
freedom, and significant improvements on gender equality and 
the treatment of women in Turkish society.  Ahtisaari said 
that while many of his interlocutors around Europe suggested 
that a 20-year timeframe for Turkish accession was necessary, 
he cautioned against setting artificial, temporal mileposts. 
What was important at this stage was to set an initial date 
for talks to begin in good faith. 
 
5.  (U)  Pursuant to the \"good faith\" reference, Ahtisaari 
directly criticized opponents of EU enlargement who, he 
asserted, tried to \"set the bar higher\" for Turkey because it 
was a Muslim nation.  Admonishing his audience not to \"mix 
religion and politics,\" Ahtisaari said that while the Turks 
should not receive special treatment, they should neither be 
discriminated against.  Obliquely addressing German CDU 
leader Angela Merkel, he said that those who suggest some 
sort of \"special relationship\" for Turkey short of EU 
membership humiliated the Turks, and likened the idea to 
offering an adulterous relationship rather than marriage. 
Ahtisaari said that fears of European \"Islamicization\" were 
groundless, and overlooked 80 years of progressive 
secularization in Turkey as well as internal EU estimates 
that as many as 70 million new workers will be needed in the 
EU by 2050 if Europeans are to maintain their current 
standard of living.  Finally, Ahtisaari opined that in the 
end, the best prophylactic against Islamic fundamentalism in 
Turkey or elsewhere was inclusion of Turkey in the European 
polity rather than exclusion and separateness:  \"An historic 
moment is at hand;  the most important moment in the modern 
history of Europe.\"

1. (C) We delivered the demarche points from Ref A-C messages 
to Leena Alto, deputy European Correspondent in the Finnish 
MFA, and to Jonna Partanen, Counselor in the Secretariat for 
EU Affairs in the office of PM Vanhanen.  Alto and Partanen 
briefed us on the positions FM Tuomioja will be taking to the 
GAERC meeting, as follows. 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
2. (U) Alto said the GoF agrees that the January elections 
are extremely important -- as is the political process that 
precedes them.  The Iraqi people deserve free and fair 
elections, and Finland has contributed to the International 
Reconstruction Fund Facility to help make that a reality. 
Alto added that Finland offers its firm support -- both 
nationally and through the EU -- to PM Allawi in the IIG\'s 
efforts to establish the institutions of civil society in 
Iraq. 
 
3. (C) Insofar as assistance to the Iraqi police is 
concerned, Finland (as Washington is aware) already 
contributes ten instructors to the academy in Jordan.  Alto 
said the GoF is willing to consider a joint EU project -- but 
anything the EU does in Iraq \"must be carefully considered in 
light of the serious security situation that now exists.\" 
 
Sudan 
----- 
 
4. (C) Alto said, \"We are on the same wavelength, very much 
so.\"  The GoF welcomes the resumption of the Abuja talks, and 
agrees the international community should keep up the 
pressure on both sides to reach an agreement.  At the same 
time, efforts must continue to find a solution to the 
humanitarian crisis on the ground.  The Finns \"recognize the 
African ownership of the process,\" she said, and support AU 
efforts in Darfur.  Alto nevertheless noted there has been 
some talk of an EU police mission.  The GoF feels there needs 
to be more clarity regarding the modalities of such a 
mission.  If that needed clarity is supplied, she said, \"we 
would consider positively\" the idea of participating in a 
\"well-planned police mission\" in Darfur. 
 
Russia 
------ 
 
5. (C) Alto noted that the agenda for the upcoming EU-Russia 
Summit includes further negotiation on the four common 
spaces.  It seems unlikely to the Finns that all four can be 
completed at the Summit.  Finland strongly believes that 
nothing should be agreed until everything is agreed, even if 
that means that the four spaces all must be held over for 
further negotiation later.  Alto said the Finns will resist 
any suggestion that Russia and the European Union agree what 
they can now and defer the rest for later: doing so would 
allow the Russians to \"pick and choose what they want\" from 
the document. 
 
6. (C) She reiterated a complaint we have heard from the 
Finns before (e.g., Ref D): that the EU has no real unity 
regarding relations with Russia.  When the going gets tough, 
a few individual members break away to pursue their own 
bilateral relationships with Russia for their own national 
reasons.  At every EU meeting Finland (which still has the 
Union\'s longest border with Russia) stresses the need for 
unity on this matter.  \"The EU is the main vehicle for 
conduct of relations with Russia,\" said Alto, \"and we want to 
keep it that way.\" 
 
Iran 
---- 
 
7. (C) Alto said the Finns fully agree on the importance of 
the November 25-26 IAEA Board of Governors meeting.  They 
support unified U.S./EU pressure on the Iranians to suspend 
all enrichment-related activity. 
 
Middle East Peace Process 
------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The GoF welcomes PM Sharon\'s plan for withdrawal from 
Gaza, said Alto.  She added that the Finns consider the 
planned Palestinian elections a necessary test case for PA 
willingness to engage in democratic reforms.  Finland 
understands it is likely the EU will offer its help in 
organizing the elections, and the GoF supports such an offer.

1. (C) Your visit to Helsinki, coming just days after the 
U.S. election, will be an excellent opportunity to review our 
bilateral and multilateral agenda with Finnish leaders, and 
to stress the value of our close relationship with Finland 
and Europe.   Finnish President Halonen has sent a telegram 
to the White House offering President Bush her \"heartfelt 
congratulations\" on his re-election and expressing her 
confidence that the \"excellent cooperation\" between the two 
presidents will continue in the future.  In a similar message 
PM Vanhanen stressed the \"great responsibility and worldwide 
trust\" connected with the U.S. Presidency; in earlier 
comments he had underlined the importance of the 
trans-Atlantic partnership in facing issues of global 
concern. 
 
2. (C) The Finns will use the opportunity to ask what changes 
in U.S. foreign policy may be in the wings.  They will also 
want to hear your assessment of events in Russia after 
Beslan.  They will expect you to ask about their new White 
Paper on foreign and security policy, which reaffirms 
Finland,s nonalignment but keeps open the NATO option, 
supports the EU\'s rapid reaction force, and commits the GoF 
to signing the Ottawa Convention by 2012.  We recommend you 
thank the Finns for their support for reconstruction in Iraq 
(including a commitment of one million euros for the UN 
protection force), and for their multiple contributions in 
Afghanistan.  End Summary. 
 
Assessing the Election 
---------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) On November 3, before the result of the U.S. 
Presidential election was known, Finnish President Halonen, 
PM Vanhanen, and Speaker of Parliament Lipponen all said they 
did not expect the outcome of the election to affect 
bilateral relations, which Halonen termed \"stable and good.\" 
Halonen (who was attending an EU meeting in Brussels, and may 
have felt the need to speak guardedly) added, however, that 
if President Bush were returned to office she hoped the 
Administration would re-visit its Iraq policy.  PM Vanhanen 
spoke in broader terms: \"Issues such as worldwide 
cooperation, general stability, terrorism, and global 
development continue to feature on the agenda ... and here a 
good partnership between Europe and the United States is 
needed.\"  On November 4, Halonen and Vanhanen both sent 
congratulatory telegrams to the White House.  Halonen offered 
President Bush her \"warm greeting and ... heartfelt 
congratulations,\" as well as \"my anticipation that our 
excellent cooperation will continue in the future.\"  In his 
message PM Vanhanen stressed the \"great responsibility and 
worldwide trust\" connected with the U.S. Presidency.  An 
editorial in the \"Helsingin Sanomat,\" Finland\'s leading 
daily, argued that \"it takes two to build bridges, and 
Europeans would be wise to do their part.  The result of a 
democratic election has to be respected.  Creating more 
conflicts across the Atlantic does not on this side of the 
ocean serve anybody\'s true interests.\" 
 
4. (C) The Finns, with their strong preference for 
multilateral action and their commitment to the 
trans-Atlantic relationship, will want to know if any gesture 
to Europe will be forthcoming from a second Bush 
administration.  FM Tuomioja may also express to you the hope 
that the second administration will adopt a more 
\"multilateralist\" strategy during its second term (ignoring 
the fact that the first administration spent months working 
for unity in the UNSC before Operation Iraqi Freedom).  The 
PM and FM may ask whether Russian ratification of the Kyoto 
Protocol will make a difference to the USG, or whether any 
new initiatives can be expected in the arms control area. 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
5. (C) The GoF -- FM Tuomioja in particular -- was critical 
of OIF, which began only days after the Finnish general 
election in March 2003.  Then, in the weeks that followed, 
new Center Party PM Anneli Jaatteenmaki was forced out of 
office over allegations that she had released classified MFA 
documents regarding conversations with the U.S. on Iraq. 
Center\'s Matti Vanhanen took over as PM, and since then has 
sought to calm the domestic political waters roiled by 
\"Iraq-Gate.\"  In March 2004, two Finnish businessmen visiting 
Baghdad as part of an exploratory trade delegation were 
killed, further decreasing GoF interest in Finns 
participating in any mission inside Iraq for the foreseeable 
future. 
 
6. (C) Nevertheless, the GoF has sought and found ways to 
assist in Iraqi reconstruction.  They made an early 
commitment of one million euros to help fund the UN 
Protection Force (reiterated by President Halonen in her UNGA 
speech); the Finns have provided ten instructors for the 
police academy in Amman; and they are prominent as one of the 
small donors (five million euros) to the IRFFI.  In your 
conversations with the PM and FM, they will be interested in 
your assessment of how reconstruction in Iraq is proceeding, 
including the prospects for free and fair elections. 
 
Afghanistan 
----------- 
 
7. (C) Finland has been a solid partner in Afghanistan. 
Afghanistan is now one of the largest recipients of Finnish 
development assistance (10 million euros this year), and 
approximately 70 Finnish troops are serving under ISAF 
auspices, including CIMIC troops in Kabul and twenty soldiers 
with the UK/Finnish/Norwegian PRT in the north.  Several 
Finnish politicians have visited Afghanistan, including the 
Parliamentary Human Rights caucus.  We recommend you thank 
the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister for Finland\'s early 
contributions to both Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 
Russia 
------ 
 
8. (C) The stability of political and commercial relations 
with Russia -- and therefore the stability of Russia itself 
-- will always be of vital importance to the Finns.  In 
recent conversations, they have said that while day-to-day 
interactions with the Russians continue on track, Finns are 
concerned about long-term trends.  FM Tuomioja told the 
Ambassador September 15 that \"the signs are less encouraging 
than they have been for some time.\" (Ref A) It is 
understandable that \"the appalling events in Beslan have 
affected Russia seriously,\" said the FM; \"we only hope they 
draw the right conclusions.\"  He worries that Putin seems to 
be relying more and more on people who are not by inclination 
natural democrats.  Your Finnish interlocutors will be very 
interested to hear your own assessment, and likely will quiz 
you about the atmosphere you encountered in your most recent 
trip to Moscow. 
 
The White Paper 
--------------- 
 
9. (C) The GoF\'s long-awaited white paper on national 
security policy was completed and sent to Parliament for 
their review in September.  In it the government reaffirms 
Finland,s nonalignment, although \"applying for membership in 
the Alliance will remain a possibility ... in the future.\" 
The White Paper has since been criticized by some of the 
nation\'s most committed trans-Atlanticists for being too 
timid in its treatment of Finland,s need for allies.  One 
commentator said the White Paper was \"born old\" in failing to 
note modern realities in Russia.  MP Liisa Jaakonsaari, the 
SDP\'s chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, criticized 
Finland,s foreign policy as lacking direction. 
 
10. (C) The White Paper probably represents the limits of the 
possible insofar as NATO membership is concerned, given that 
public opinion remains strongly against membership.  (One 
recent poll showed 80% opposed.)  Foreign Minister Tuomioja 
told us last year that he did not expect the NATO question to 
arise during this Parliamentary term (2003-2007).  But that 
does not change the reality of Finland\'s position.  The Finns 
see NATO as the foundation for trans-Atlantic security.  They 
have made NATO interoperability one of the guiding principles 
of their armed forces, they are strong supporters of PfP, and 
they welcomed the Baltic nations\' entry into the Alliance. 
(MFA PolDir Lyra worried, though, that NATO planners were 
pressing the three new members too hard to shift capabilities 
away from territorial defense to crisis management.)  The 
White Paper does state that \"Finland considers a strong 
trans-Atlantic relationship to be important for the security 
of Europe;\" Finland will foster that relationship on a 
bilateral basis with the U.S., as well as through the EU and 
the PfP. 
 
11. (C) The White Paper restated that territorial defense is 
the fundamental mission of Finland,s armed forces, but 
commits the nation for the first time to providing combat 
troops to EU rapid reaction forces.  It mentions repeatedly 
the need to combat terrorism, but does not provide much 
information on how the GoF is organized to do that.  And in 
one of its most controversial decisions, it commits Finland 
to signing the Ottawa Convention by 2012, and destroying its 
anti-personnel landmines by 2016. 
 
The Finnish EU Presidency (July-December 2006) 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
12. (C) The Finns may be the last EU president under the old 
system, since the Constitution Treaty is scheduled to take 
effect during their tenure.  The Finns are acutely aware of 
this, and have already started preparations to make the most 
of the opportunity.  (We are told, for example, that one of 
the reasons for FM Tuomioja\'s surprise choice of Pilvi-Sisko 
Vierros-Villeneuve to succeed Markus Lyra as Political 
Director was her past experience in Brussels during 
Finland,s last presidency.)  The Finns have said that 
strengthening trans-Atlantic relations will be one of the 
themes of their presidency. 
 
China Arms Embargo 
------------------ 
 
13. (C) We have heard that there is a split within MFA 
between those (including Vierros-Villeneuve, currently 
Nonproliferation chief) who genuinely believe that the Code 
of Conduct can and should be made to function efficiently to 
stop the kinds of high-tech exports that the Chinese most 
want, and those in the human rights section, who agree with 
the U.S. that lifting the embargo would send the wrong 
signal.  The Embassy recommends that you stress to the FM 
that lifting the EU arms embargo sends the wrong message at 
the wrong time to China, and may give the Chinese Government 
the impression that it can act with impunity with regard to 
serious violations of human rights. 
 
14. (C) In conversations with the Ambassador reported in Refs 
C and D, MFA Under Secretary Laajava and Presidential Chief 
of Staff Kalela both agreed in principle with the reasoning 
behind the U.S. position.  The Ambassador asked whether a 
call from Secretary Powell to President Halonen would be 
useful, caveating the question by saying we would not want to 
embarrass either President Halonen or the Secretary by 
putting them in an awkward position.  Both Laajava and Kalela 
said that such a call might be useful, although neither could 
guarantee it would change Finland\'s position. 
 
War on Terror 
------------- 
 
15. (C) Finland is an ally in the fight against global 
terrorism, but Finns believe the possibility of an attack on 
Finnish soil remote.  FM Tuomioja in particular is concerned 
that civil liberties not be lost in the rush to investigate 
and prevent terrorist attacks.  For example, he has been 
critical of U.S. policy regarding the Guantanamo detainees 
and the Abu Ghraib scandal and may raise these with you. 
 
Trafficking-in-Persons 
---------------------- 
 
16. (U) Tuomioja may complain to you about Finland\'s Tier 2 
ranking.  We recommend that you thank the Finns for hosting 
the September OSCE/ODIHR conference on the rights of 
trafficking victims, and note the passage of new legislation 
making trafficking a separate legal offense -- but stress 
that a better record in prosecution and victim assistance is 
needed. 
 
The \"Helsinki Process\" 
---------------------- 
 
17. (SBU) Tuomioja is the co-chair (with the Tanzanian FM) of 
the Helsinki Group, the steering committee for the Helsinki 
Process that was launched in 2002 to promote a more just and 
equitable globalization process.  Tuomioja and President 
Halonen are interested in the negative effects of 
globalization and deeply committed to fostering a North-South 
dialogue aimed at ameliorating these effects.  To that end, 
the Helsinki Process sponsors regular conferences and 
seminars about global problem solving, the global economic 
agenda, and human security in all of its forms.  President 
Halonen\'s speech before the UNGA in September centered on 
globalization, its inherent inequities, and the urgent need 
for the developed and developing world to work together to 
redress these.  (On the same day Halonen suggested to the 
press in New York that an international tribunal be formed to 
determine the legality of OIF.)  For his part, the Foreign 
Minister\'s bilateral meetings in New York during the UNGA\'s 
opening week were all related to the Helsinki Process.  It is 
possible the Foreign Minister will raise this during your 
meeting.  You may wish to ask him about the Helsinki Group\'s 
upcoming report on globalization, due to be released in the 
spring of 2005.

deployment of a Georgian battalion to Iraq for \"middle ring\" 
security is imminent, with a Romanian unit likely to follow 
soon after, but that both deployments are contingent upon the 
salary support promised by Finland and other EU states.  POL 
Chief said that the UN Comptroller and Legal Advisor 
apparently are opposed to establishing a UN trust fund to 
disburse these funds, and urged that the GoF consider 
disbursing the funds bilaterally, or via a multilateral 
account set up by the EC or a donor country. 
 
2. (C) Kalkku said that according to her understanding, the 
possibility of a UN trust fund was still a live issue.  The 
Finnish mission to the United Nations has reported that the 
Asia division of the Secretariat strongly supports the 
creation of such a fund, and therefore a split-recommendation 
memo was likely to go forward to the UNSYG for his decision. 
 
3. (C) Kalkku -- stressing that this was a preliminary 
reaction -- said that if the SYG decided against a UN trust 
fund, the Finns probably could not disburse the money 
bilaterally in the current calendar year, because it has been 
obligated under the GoF budget chapter for multilateral 
assistance.  In calendar year 2005, it might be possible to 
reprogram the money to a bilateral chapter -- but the Finns 
would much prefer a multilateral fund, rather than having to 
set up and operate a fund on a national basis.  POL Chief 
recommended that the GoF make clear in New York their 
preference for a UN trust fund. 
 
4. (C) Kalkku asked whether the Georgian deployment is likely 
to take place before the end of the year.  Embassy would 
appreciate Department\'s assistance in answering this question.

1. (U) Netherlands Ambassador Engels telephoned U.S. 
Ambassador Mack on November 10 to report that he had received 
instructions from The Hague to deliver a demarche on behalf 
of the EU, requesting that the GoF extend the tenure of 
Ambassador Markku Reimaa as coordinator for the Group of 
Government Experts (GGE) on Mines Other Than Anti-Personnel 
Mines (MOTAPM) in Geneva.  Engels said he had just contacted 
Political Director Markus Lyra to make the case for Reimaa 
staying on.  It is our understanding that a similar demarche 
was made by the Germans to the Finnish embassy in Berlin, on 
behalf of the Western Group. 
 
2. (U) Upon receipt of Ref A November 12, POL Chief spoke 
with Pilvi-Sisko Vierros-Villeneuve, who is currently head of 
MFA\'s Arms Control, Disarmament, and Nonproliferation Unit, 
and who will succeed Lyra as Political Director starting in 
January.  Vierros-Villeneuve said that the MFA had already 
informed the Finnish delegation in Geneva that Ambassador 
Reimaa may continue in his coordinator\'s role until September 
1, 2005.  \"Finland is as interested in the outcome (of the 
MOTAPM process) as you are,\" said Vierros-Villeneuve, \"and is 
not willing to do anything to harm this process.\"  If 
necessary, she said, Reimaa could continue in his position 
until November 2005 -- but for the period September-November 
he would have to cover the talks from Helsinki. 
 
3. (U) Vierros-Villeneuve clarified the issue of resources 
(Ref B), which she said is of real concern to the GoF. 
Finland will hold the EU presidency in the second half of 
2006.  The EU\'s Constitution Treaty is scheduled to take 
effect during that period, so Finland may be the last 
president under the current system.  The Finns are already 
preparing for this, and want to have their presidency team -- 
including Reimaa\'s successor -- in place far enough in 
advance of July 1, 2006 so that they will be fully 
operational when the presidency begins.  POL Chief said that 
we certainly understand this, but (drawing on Ref B para 3) 
noted the feeling of the Western Group that a negotiated 
agreement on MOTAPM could be achievable within the next year 
if we do not change the chair.  Vierros-Villeneuve -- who has 
been waiting to receive Reimaa\'s own assessment of where 
matters stand -- said that \"this is extremely useful 
information,\" and \"very good to hear.\"  If there is a chance 
of reaching a negotiated agreement in a year, the Finns 
\"really need to put our effort into it.\" 
 
4. (C) Vierros-Villeneuve said that the GoF sees arms control 
as one of the areas where they hope to make a contribution 
during their presidency.  MOTAPM is one example; another is 
the BWC: \"One of our major tasks\" will be to work with the 
U.S. toward a positive outcome of the BWC Review Conference, 
she said.  \"We\'re very keen on this option -- we want to do 
more than just be in charge of keeping the Protocol alive.\" 
She said she would be happy to discuss this and other arms 
control priorities with U.S. officials during her upcoming 
visit to Washington.

REF: NONE

Summary 
-------- 
 
1. (C) During her November 8 meeting in Helsinki with Finnish 
Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, Assistant Secretary Jones 
said that the Administration was already talking about 
reinvigorating the transatlantic relationship, and said that 
one of the purposes of her trip was to ask Finland\'s views 
about this.  FM Tuomioja replied that U.S. \"re-engagement\" in 
the Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative (BMENA) 
and Middle East Peace Process (MEPP) was at the top of 
Brussel\'s priority list, and that the current situation with 
Arafat afforded both risks and opportunities to push the 
peace process forward.  A/S Jones expressed concern about the 
ongoing Rogers child-custody case, and FM Tuomioja said that 
he was confident the Finnish courts would resolve the 
situation.  Asked for his views about how the U.S. and EU 
could positively engage Russia, FM Tuomioja opined that 
Moscow did not understand how the EU works and was engaged in 
futile attempts to split EU countries over certain issues. 
A/S Jones and FM Tuomioja agreed that the U.S. and EU should 
not shy away from human rights concerns in Chechnya and 
acknowledged signs that the Russians again were willing to 
discuss frozen conflicts such as the Transnistria and South 
Ossetia disputes.  FM Tuomioja said that the EU\'s statements 
on Ukraine\'s election had possibly been too harsh; FM 
Tuomioja and A/S Jones agreed on the importance of not giving 
up on democratization in Ukraine. 
 
2. (C) A/S Jones thanked the Foreign Minister for Finland\'s 
contributions to coalition efforts inside Afghanistan and 
Iraq.  After the successful elections in Afghanistan, the 
next big challenge was eradication of opium poppy 
cultivation.  FM Tuomioja agreed, remarking that U.S. and EU 
agricultural policies do not facilitate viable alternatives 
to poppy cultivation for poor farmers.  FM Tuomioja also 
advocated getting tough with Afghan Government elements 
involved in narcotics trafficking.  A/S Jones expressed U.S. 
solidarity with Finland\'s support for Turkish EU accession, 
prompting the Foreign Minister to opine that while an early 
date for accession talks was desirable, simply establishing a 
concrete date was the most important step.  At the request of 
Finland\'s Under Secretary for Political Affairs, A/S Jones 
offered to put the Finnish officials in touch with U.S. 
diplomats in Russia who are handling the State Department\'s 
anti-trafficking in persons efforts there.  Finally, noting 
that Arctic climate change threatened the entire Arctic 
region, the Foreign Minister hoped the upcoming Arctic 
Council meeting in Reykjavik would spur efforts to ameliorate 
this.  A/S Jones replied that the U.S. was also looking 
forward to the meeting and seeing the Council\'s new report. 
End Summary. 
 
Second Term Priorities 
---------------------- 
 
3. (C) A/S Jones stated that, with the election behind us, 
Secretary Powell was actively preparing for several major 
 
SIPDIS 
meetings, including the OSCE ministerial, and NATO and USEU 
summits.  The Administration wanted to reinvigorate the 
transatlantic relationship.  She called the FM\'s attention to 
the President\'s reference to this in his November 3 press 
conference.  FM Tuomioja said no one should forget that 
transatlantic cooperation was already working and delivering 
results in most areas, and that where differences remained, 
there were effective ways of dealing with them.  The Foreign 
Minister said that he hoped Secretary Powell would indeed 
remain in office, and that he looked forward to seeing him 
again at the NATO meeting, and perhaps in April in New York 
at the next meeting of the Helsinki Process. 
 
4. (C) A/S Jones said one of the purposes of her visit was to 
ask for his ideas on ways that transatlantic relations could 
be strengthened during the President\'s second term.  The 
Foreign Minister replied that the Broader-Middle East and 
MEPP was the \"number one item\" among EU members, who expected 
the U.S. to \"re-engage\" and jumpstart the process.  He said 
that while Arafat\'s death could lead to instability, it also 
afforded a window of opportunity should the U.S. choose to 
seize it.  A/S Jones said that although she could not speak 
for the White House, she knew the State Department was indeed 
considering how best to use the Arafat situation to promote a 
peaceful solution in the Middle East. 
Rogers Case 
----------- 
 
5. (C) A/S Jones said that there was concern in Washington 
over the ongoing Rogers case, in which a Finnish mother has 
refused to obey U.S. and Finnish court orders requiring her 
to surrender her two dual-national children to their U.S. 
citizen father, and expressed hope that it would soon be 
resolved.  She noted that Finland needs to obey the letter of 
the law.  Tuomioja replied that it was a \"messy\" case and not 
primarily the responsibility of his ministry, although he 
acknowledged that Finland was bound by international treaty. 
He said that he had faith in Finland\'s legal system and that 
he believed the case would be cleared up soon.  Jones 
underscored the importance of complying with the Hague 
Convention. 
 
Russia 
------ 
 
6. (C) A/S Jones asked FM Tuomioja for Finland\'s perspective 
on how the U.S. and EU should approach Russia to bring about 
positive engagement.  FM Tuomioja said that he believed 
Russia had unrealistic or ignorant expectations about how to 
approach the EU.  The Foreign Minister said that Moscow 
wanted Finland to be a bridge between Russia and the EU, not 
understanding that Finland was itself an integral part of the 
EU.  Russia did not understand how the EU worked or was 
evolving; Moscow believed it could selectively choose what 
issues it wished to address bilaterally with EU nations in 
order to drive wedges among EU members.  Such a strategy was 
doomed to fail.  Some EU countries had been more 
\"forthcoming\" with Russia on issues like visa policy, which 
had probably weakened the EU\'s position; hence the need for 
the EU to follow common policy where it existed.  FM Tuomioja 
opined that the postponement of an EU-Russia summit 
originally planned for November 11 was due to Moscow\'s 
inability to limit the agenda to such \"wedge issues.\"  A/S 
Jones agreed that it is good for the Russians to understand 
there is a limit to how far they can push the EU. 
 
Chechnya 
-------- 
 
7. (C) The Foreign Minister said that the EU and U.S. should 
not shy away from issues such as human rights in Russia, 
specifically the situation in Chechnya.  Finland fully 
supported Russia\'s need to aggressively combat terrorism, but 
that did not legitimate humans rights abuses.  A/S Jones 
agreed, noting that the fight against terrorism did not 
justify backsliding on democracy.  FM Tuomioja cited the need 
for Russia to find a \"legitimate partner\" with whom they can 
reach a political solution in Chechnya.  A/S Jones said that 
Russia wanted the U.S. to label all Chechens as terrorists, 
obviating the need for political talks.  FM Tuomioja 
mentioned a recent flap over a Chechen website on a Finnish 
server that was accused of inciting terrorism in the 
Caucasus, advising that Finland had taken up the issue of its 
own accord, not because of any Russia request or pressure; 
Secretary Jones said that Russia had approached the U.S. 
 
SIPDIS 
about shutting down a similar website located in Texas. 
 
Ukraine/Belarus/Frozen Conflicts 
-------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) FM Tuomioja and A/S Jones agreed on the importance of 
not giving up on democratization in Ukraine.  A/S Jones said 
that, even though real concerns existed, the Ukrainians 
needed to hear the message that opportunities existed for 
participation in transatlantic institutions, including 
eventual EU membership, if progress continued.  She said that 
Ukraine might be ready for WTO membership within a year, a 
huge step toward a better future.  FM Tuomioja said that 
while the EU could not say \"yes\" to Ukraine now, it would be 
a mistake to say \"never.\"  There were interim stages of 
integration that could be explored.  He said that the EU\'s 
statement on the recent election could possibly have been 
\"too tough,\" as the elections had gone better than he 
expected.  Jones said that like the EU, the U.S. believes 
that no matter what the outcome of the elections, the U.S. 
cannot turn its back on Ukraine. 
 
9. (C) The Foreign Minister asked A/S Jones semi-rhetorically 
if an independent Belarus had a future, arguing that Belarus 
was a paradox as reintegration with Russia would actually 
improve the region\'s human rights.  A/S Jones replied that 
there was scant enthusiasm in Moscow for such a solution. 
A/S Jones noted that Russia was at least willing to schedule 
discussions on frozen conflicts such as Transnistria and 
South Ossetia again. 
Caucasus/Central Asia 
--------------------- 
 
10. (C) A/S Jones asked FM Tuomioja about the situation in 
Central Asia.  FM Tuomioja replied that he had visited only 
Kyrgyzstan, the only place in the world where a Russian and 
American military base co-existed.  He said that Finland had 
no specific advice on Central Asia other than the EU could 
play a useful role in the region.  A/S Jones mentioned that 
the region had institutional associations with Europe via 
NATO\'s Partnerhsip for Peace (PfP) and other similar 
arrangements.  The PfP has been good for Central Asia, not 
least for improvements in the way the governments treat their 
soldiers.  FM Tuomioja mentioned that he planned to visit 
Kazakhstan in January.  A/S Jones opined that the biggest 
challenge to the region will be its upcoming political 
transitions and the need for Central Asian polities to see 
that democratic transitions can work. 
 
11. (C) FM Tuomioja noted he had recently visited Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, where there seemed to be a new willingness on 
both sides to show some flexibility.  Here again, Russia is 
the key.  A/S Jones said this seemed to be an area where the 
Russians are willing to engage in a constructive way, but the 
parties remain so volatile that it is hard to make any 
progress.  A/S Jones and FM Tuomioja agreed that neither the 
Armenian nor Azerbaijani Governments had done a good job of 
preparing their publics for an eventual settlement, despite 
what progress might have been made in private bilateral 
discussions. 
 
Climate Change 
-------------- 
 
12. (U) The Foreign Minister said that a meeting of the 
Arctic Council in Reykjavik would consider a new report on 
climate change in the Arctic region.  He said that it was 
undeniable that such changed was taking place, which could 
have devastating effects for the region\'s future.  Tuomioja 
said that he did not expect the U.S. to change its position 
on the Kyoto Protocol, but hoped it would address important 
environmental issues, and perhaps engage in negotiating a 
\"Kyoto Two.\"  A/S Jones said that the Administration was 
definitely interested in looking at the facts and the science 
of the issue.  FM Tuomioja stressed the importance of the 
Arctic Council in bringing together representatives of the 
Arctic\'s indigenous peoples (sic) with the regions\' 
governments.  Such meetings of regional fora are all to the 
good, he said -- an example being the eight-plus-one 
consultations under e-PINE.  Political Director Lyra seconded 
this assessment. 
 
Trafficking-in-Persons 
---------------------- 
 
13. (SBU) A/S Jones asked the Foreign Minister about 
Finland\'s recent anti-TIP activity, specifically in the areas 
of victim assistance and prosecution.  FM Tuomioja said that 
Finland had recently adopted new anti-TIP legislation and was 
confident its implementation would bring improvements in all 
areas.  He cited the recent break-up of a Russian-organized 
prostitution ring in Helsinki, hoping that Finland\'s progress 
would be \"reflected in future evaluations.\"  Under Secretary 
of State for Political Affairs Jaakko Laajava said that 
Finland\'s greatest obstacle in combating trafficking was 
internal conditions inside Russia.  A/S Jones replied that 
the U.S. was working aggressively with NGOs inside Russia to 
go after trafficking rings, ameliorate the conditions that 
led to trafficking, and educate potential victims about the 
dangers involved.  Laajava asked A/S Jones for information 
about the partners the U.S. was working with inside Russia, 
and she promised to ask U.S. diplomats to put him in touch 
with the appropriate people in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  FM 
Tuomioja added that Finland enjoyed an increasing measure of 
trilateral cooperation with Russia and Estonia on the TIP 
issue. 
 
14. (C) FM Tuomioja lamented that the Russians are moving 
border guards from their side of the Russian-Finnish border 
to southern regions, which increases the burden on Finnish 
border guards.  A/S Jones recalled Finland\'s very good 
training programs for Central Asian border authorities, and 
asked whether that is continuing.  U/S Laajava said only that 
\"it will be many years before our experience can produce 
added value\" in the \"totally different environment\" of 
Central Asia. 
 
Afghanistan/Iraq 
---------------- 
 
15. (SBU) A/S Jones thanked the Foreign Minister for 
Finland\'s contributions to the efforts inside Iraq and 
Afghanistan.  Election in Afghanistan had been far better 
than we had dared hope.  One of the biggest challenges now 
was to eradicate opium poppy cultivation to stop the drug 
flow out of the country; it was necessary to find economic 
alternatives for poppy farmers so that they could survive 
without resorting to poppy cultivation.  FM Tuomioja agreed 
that the elections had been successful, and added that it 
would be good if the Iraqi elections were also as successful, 
although that seemed more difficult.  He said that now that 
Afghanistan had a democratically-elected government, the 
international community had to be tougher on government 
elements involved in narcotics trafficking.  He agreed that 
finding economic alternatives for small farmers was a general 
problem everywhere that narcotics were produced, and argued 
that U.S. and EU agricultural subsidies and protective 
barriers exacerbated the problem. 
 
16. (C) A/S Jones said that in Iraq our focus is on helping 
to build a legitimate police and military, along with 
reconstruction generally.  She thanked the Foreign Minister 
for Finland\'s readiness to contribute a million euros to a UN 
protection fund in Iraq.  Discussions were underway in NATO 
about how best to proceed with the training of Iraqi military 
forces.  (Note: At a press availability that followed the 
meeting, the Assistant Secretary also thanked Finland 
publicly for Finland\'s contributions to reconstruction and 
stability in Afghanistan and Iraq.) 
 
Iran 
---- 
 
17. (C) FM Tuomioja said that he was hopeful the Iranian 
response to the EU \"nuclear\" package might be positive, and 
that he believed that there were some signs this might be the 
case.  If not, the international community faced a very 
serious problem. 
 
Turkey/Cypress 
-------------- 
 
18. (C) A/S Jones said that the U.S. was grateful for 
Finland\'s position on eventual Turkish accession and would do 
what it could to keep the Turks moving down the path of 
necessary reform.  The U.S. had done its best, working behind 
the scenes, and hoped the EU had noticed.  The Foreign 
Minister replied that this was appreciated, but wryly asked 
that the U.S. not be \"too helpful\" and interject itself in 
such a way that opponents of Turkish accession could use U.S. 
support for Turkey as a straw man.  FM Tuomioja said that the 
present government of Turkey had made more progress toward 
substantive reform in two years than the previous government 
had made in twelve.  Finland hoped the EU Commission in 
December would set a concrete date for the beginning of 
accession talks.  FM Tuomioja opined that whether the date 
was earlier or later was unimportant, but that the 
establishment of a concrete timetable was the primary 
concern.  Political Director Lyra said that the latter half 
of 2005 was most often mentioned in Brussels as the likely 
timeframe.  Both FM Tuomioja and A/S Jones agreed that it was 
necessary to keep up the pressure on Turkey as regards 
Cyprus, and that confidence-building measures such as the 
withdrawal of some Turkish troops from the north would be 
positive.  They also agreed on the difficulty of working with 
Cypriot President Popadopoulos. 
 
19. (C) FM Tuomioja said that during his visit to Yerevan, 
the Armenians had asked for help in getting the Turks to open 
the border; some Turkish officials have privately sympathized 
with the Armenian goal, \"but the Turks have pushed themselves 
into a corner.\"  A/S Jones replied that the USG is working 
hard on this; train transport is the first priority. 
 
ESDP/Security Policy 
-------------------- 
20. (C) FM Tuomioja said that Finland\'s Parliament would 
endorse the general outline of the recently released \"White 
Paper,\" although there would probably be many minor revisions 
and changes.  A/S Jones said that the U.S. was pleased that 
Finnish interoperability with NATO was stressed in the report. 
 
21. (U) A/S Jones has cleared this cable.

\"WE NEED EACH OTHER\" 
 
 
Classified By: APAO HELENE KESSLER FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) In a November 9 meeting with Finnish PM Matti 
Vanhanen, visiting EUR 
A/S Jones reassured the Prime Minister of the importance the 
Bush 
Administration places on the transatlantic relationship, 
citing the President\'s 
references to outreach to Europe and the importance of both 
the EU and NATO 
in his very first statement after winning re-election.  The 
Prime Minister 
confirmed that he would like to visit the US to discuss the 
Finnish EU 
presidency.  PM Vanhanen said Finland opposes any EU 
structured cooperation 
on defense that duplicates NATO.  An EU rapid response force 
is new for Finns 
but a natural outgrowth of their experience as peacekeepers. 
A/S Jones thanked 
the Prime Minister for contributions to Iraq and Afghanistan 
and raised the 
Rogers child-custody case and IPR.  Other issues discussed 
included Turkey and 
Russia.  End Summary. 
 
U.S. Elections 
-------------- 
 
2. (SBU) PM Vanhanen conveyed congratulations to President 
Bush on his 
reelection and commented on the high number of individuals 
who voted in the 
2004 U.S. elections.  A/S Jones noted U.S. pride in the large 
voter turnout and 
high interest in the issues.  Vanhanen said that the previous 
week\'s meeting of the 
European Council included extensive discussion about the U.S. 
elections and the 
importance of transatlantic relations. 
 
Iraq/Afghanistan 
---------------- 
 
3. (SBU) A/S Jones expressed appreciation for Finland\'s 
active role and 
contributions in Afghanistan and Iraq, saying Finland should 
take great pride in 
the success of the historic elections in Afghanistan.  On 
Iraq, the path to 
improving the situation is through the elections at the end 
of January.  The Iraqis 
need the help of the international community to make free and 
fair elections a 
reality.  The generous funding Finland has offered for 
protection of a UN 
presence in Iraq is important. 
 
Finland\'s EU Presidency 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) When A/S Jones asked where he would put the emphasis 
in the transatlantic 
relationship, PM Vanhanen answered that Finland has already 
started preparing 
for its EU presidency, in the latter half of 2006.  Its job 
is to lead the EU during 
that half year period when the Constitution Treaty is 
scheduled to take effect, 
working with the EU agenda.  While Finland has a \"crisis 
scenario\" for that 
period, the Prime Minister stated that \"we hope we don\'t 
inherit all of the open 
issues,\" such as the WTO negotiations with the U.S.  The EU\'s 
relations with 
Russia are very important to Finland, but that question must 
be seen in the bigger 
picture of EU-U.S.-Russian relations.  \"We need each other,\" 
the Prime Minister 
emphasized. 
 
EU Defense Cooperation 
---------------------- 
 
5. (C) PM Vanhanen pointed out that Finland has underlined, 
during his Prime 
Ministership, that it opposes any EU structured cooperation 
on defense that 
duplicates NATO\'s role. \"When we build crisis management 
capability in 
Europe, it must be with good cooperation with NATO and a good 
link to the 
USA at the same time.\" 
 
White Paper/EU Rapid Reaction Force 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
6. (C) A/S Jones told the Prime Minister that the USG was 
very impressed with 
Finland\'s recently-released White Paper on security policy 
and its references to 
NATO interoperability.  The Prime Minister noted that a new 
question for 
Finland is how to create a rapid reaction force.  Given the 
history of Finland\'s 
active role in peacekeeping, it is important to take part in 
the ESDP and to start 
cooperation in two rapid reaction battle groups (one with 
Sweden and Norway, and one with 
Germany and the Netherlands).  A/S Jones agreed that this is 
a formula that all of 
us are finding useful. 
 
US-EU Agenda/Turkey 
------------------- 
 
7. (C) A/S Jones shared U.S. priorities for the US-EU agenda 
including Iraq, 
Afghanistan, the Middle East Peace Process and EU 
enlargement, which enlarges 
stability in this very important part of the world.  On 
Turkey, she emphasized 
that the U.S. wants to be sure that we keep working with 
Turkey in parallel with the 
EU.  The Prime Minister was quite optimistic about prospects 
for Turkey\'s 
eventual accession and believed that preparations to start 
negotiations have 
already encouraged big developments in Turkey.  \"They are 
ready to work hard.\" 
Finland\'s new EU commissioner Olli Rehn, who used to be 
Vanhanen\'s 
assistant, will have the enlargement portfolio.  PM Vanhanen 
reflected that 
Finland is far enough from Turkey that it can be neutral in 
this matter.   He 
stressed that Turkish membership is very important for 
Finland.  He believed that 
when Turkey becomes a member all open questions, such as the 
Armenia border 
and Cyprus, must be solved at the same time and all parties 
understand that. 
 
Russia 
------ 
 
8. (C) PM Vanhanen agreed with A/S Jones that engagement with 
Russia remains 
very important.  This is especially true for Finland, given 
the increasing 
importance of bilateral trade (he projected that in 2010 
Russia would be 
Finland\'s largest single trade partner).  The Prime Minister 
said the EU must 
hold to a common policy on Russia, and part of that policy 
must be to insist that 
none of the four \"common spaces\" is agreed until all are 
agreed.  A/S Jones 
welcomed the EU desire to move on all four issues, and not 
just terrorism. 
 
Bilateral Issues: IPR/Rogers/Possible PM Visit 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
9. (C) A/S Jones raised concern that U.S. pharmaceuticals are 
being accorded 
inadequate intellectual property protection under current 
Finnish regulations. 
The Prime Minister confirmed that he has the needed 
information on this issue. 
On the Rogers child custody case, A/S Jones acknowledged 
Finland\'s adherence 
to the Hague convention,  expressing appreciation that so 
much has been done to 
resolve the issue.  The Prime Minster felt that in these sad 
cases too much was in 
the press; political decision makers should not take part 
since they are questions 
for the courts.  He stressed that Finland is a signatory to 
the Hague convention 
and he hoped the issue will be resolved on the basis of the 
convention. 
10. (SBU) A/S Jones said that as we are just getting 
organized for the new 
administration, the Department could seek a decision on the 
possibility of a visit 
to Washington by the Prime Minister. PM Vanhanen confirmed 
that he is very 
ready and willing to visit the U.S. as part of Finland\'s 
preparations for its 
upcoming EU presidency and stressed that Finland wants to be 
in close contact 
with the U.S. during this time.

1.  (C) Poloffs delivered reftel demarche to officials at the 
MFA and to Jonna Partanen, Special Advisor on EU Affairs to 
Prime Minister Vanhanen.  On November 19, Poloff received 
feedback from Leena Aalto, Counselor in the MFA\'s EU Affairs 
Division.  Aalto\'s remarks were keyed to the issues covered 
in reftel. 
 
Middle-East Peace Process 
------------------------- 
2.  (C)  Aalto said that the top priority for Finland was 
securing strong EU support for a new electoral process aimed 
at electing a new generation of post-Arafat Palestinian 
leaders.  She said that Arafat\'s death provided a \"window of 
opportunity\" in which to promote a substantive peace 
settlement in Palestine, and that the EU and U.S. needed to 
closely cooperate to take advantage of this opportunity. 
(Note:  Aalto\'s remarks about the \"window\" were almost 
identical to those made by Foreign Minister Tuomioja on Nov. 
8 during a meeting with EUR A/S Jones in Helsinki). 
 
China Arms Embargo 
------------------ 
3.  (C)  Aalto opined that she did not believe the EU would 
produce a statement suggesting to China that the arms embargo 
would be lifted in the near future.  She said that certain EU 
countries would push hard for this, but that so many 
differences remained about how to revise the Code of Conduct 
and how to pursue the EU\'s human rights dialogue with 
Beijing, that it would be very difficult to draft any 
consensus statement.  She said that the fact the discussion 
was back on the agenda for November was already a concession 
to EU members that wished to lift the embargo.  Finland\'s 
official position would be that it was too early to produce 
such a statement. 
 
Belarus 
------- 
4.  (C)  Finland shares American concerns over Belarus, and 
agrees that U.S.-EU coordination is important.  Finland will 
support whatever consensus emerges at the GAERC as regards 
possible measures against the Belarusian leadership. 
 
Cyprus 
------ 
5.  (C)  Aalto said that she understood Cyprus was no longer 
on the November GAERC agenda. 
 
Turkey 
------ 
6.  (C)  Finland supports Turkish EU accession and will try 
to build consensus for setting a concrete date for talks to 
begin.  Aalto said that it was possible certain EU countries 
might support setting a date, but propose language suggesting 
that an arrangement short of full membership might still be a 
\"positive\" outcome to accession talks.  Finland was opposed 
to this since it would send a negative signal to Turkey at 
the outset of negotiations.  However, Aalto said that the 
question of timing (when the actual date is) was less 
important than the establishment of a concrete date itself. 
She said that Finland would prefer an early date, but would 
support whatever consensus emerged so long as it was \"clear 
and concrete.\" 
 
Iran 
---- 
7.  (C)  Aalto also said that Finland was interested in the 
anticipated GAERC discussion about Iran\'s nuclear program. 
She said that both Tehran\'s positive response to the European 
proposal and Secretary Powell\'s comments about Iranian 
attempts to obscure efforts to produce a warhead and delivery 
vehicle would likely be discussed at the GAERC.

CAPITALISM 
 
Classified By: POLOFF DAVID ALLEN SCHLAEFER FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (C)  Finland\'s Foreign Minister, Erkki Tuomioja (SDP), 
raised eyebrows by posting an essay to his personal website 
alleging a \"systematic campaign\" by the Finnish mainstream 
media to promote a \"rightwing\" social and foreign policy 
agenda.  Tuomioja\'s essay was directed against Finland\'s 
leading newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (HS), and its Chief 
Editor, Janne Virkkunen.  Virkkunen penned an editorial that 
appeared in the HS on November 14 in which he lamented the 
conformity of Finland\'s \"consensus\" system of politics and 
praised a new report by the Center for Finnish Business and 
Policy Studies (EVA) entitled \"Roadmap to Finland\'s Future 
Success.\"  The \"Roadmap\" report advocates labor market 
reforms and calls for increasing productivity through longer 
working hours in order to meet the challenges of 
globalization as well as Finland\'s ticking demographic time 
bomb.  Tuomioja, in unusually strong language, accused 
Virkkunen and his newspaper of \"feeding porridge to a 
reluctant nation\" and telling workers to \"work twice as hard 
for half their wages in order for the elite to enjoy greater 
incomes, preferably without the taxman interfering.\"  The 
website essay sparked the inevitable controversy in the 
Finnish media.  The essay, which originally appeared on the 
site late on the 15th, disappeared the next day.  However, 
the essay reappeared again, apparently unedited, on the 17th. 
 
 
A Trial Balloon? 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Tuomioja is known for shooting from the hip, 
although the essay was somewhat shrill even by his standards. 
 If anything, the Helsingin Sanomat is more often left of 
center on key issues, and the foreign minister\'s assertion to 
the contrary is probably seen by most Finns as an 
exaggeration bordering on the absurd.  Moreover, Virkkunen\'s 
offending editorial was relatively measured in tone, stating 
that it was a \"healthy sign\" that differing opinions on 
globalization and economic issues were being heard, and that 
the Social Democrats should be more open to discussion of 
dissenting views.  The editorial also mentioned a report 
submitted last week by a globalization task force appointed 
by Prime Minister Vanhanen that offered suggestions similar 
to those in the EVA \"Roadmap.\" 
 
 
3.  (C)  Tuomioja has held forth on his website on all manner 
of social, cultural, and political issues in the past, and 
his musings are no strangers to controversy.  However, the 
current piece could be more artifice and design than random 
reaction.  Tuomioja is considering whether to run for the SDP 
chairmanship next summer.  Although Finland\'s next general 
election is not until 2007, the Foreign Minister may be 
contemplating his chances to become prime minister (should 
the SDP win) or to run for President (should Tarja Halonen 
decline to run again).  Tuomioja and Halonen are the leaders 
of the SDP\'s left wing.  A recent poll found that Tuomioja 
was the least popular with SDP party members of the major 
contenders for the SDP chair;  however, the same poll found 
that Tuomioja was the most popular contender with the public 
at large.  The odd essay might be a trial balloon of sorts, 
or an attempt to gain yet more popular support so as to be 
able to present himself to the SDP braintrust next summer as 
\"the man who can win back the prime ministership.\"  Finland 
is currently experiencing a major transportation workers 
strike as a dispute over the hiring of part-time bus drivers 
has spread, and Tuomioja\'s populist rhetoric could be 
designed to tap into what he perceived to be public anger 
over greedy employers exploiting average Finns.  If so, 
judging from the initial public reaction to the essay (and 
the strike), he may have overreached.

Classified By: PolOff David Allen Schlaefer, reasons 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Of all the open questions in Finnish foreign policy, 
the issue of whether to join NATO is the biggest.  It is 
debated endlessly in the editorial and op-ed pages, but that 
debate has yet to affect public opinion.  Polls continue to 
show strong opposition to membership, in part because of 
Finland\'s tradition of nonalignment, in part because of Iraq, 
and in part because a mistrustful public still thinks of NATO 
in Cold War terms and does not have a clear sense of where 
NATO transformation is taking the Alliance.  At the same 
time, Finland\'s leaders make no bones about the importance of 
the NATO to trans-Atlantic security.  Finland retains a close 
relationship with the Alliance: it is an active member of 
PfP, and is committed to NATO interoperability.  This close 
relationship reflects practical calculations about Finland\'s 
neighbor to the east -- the latest White Paper on national 
security policy, released in September, retains territorial 
defense as the primary mission of the Finnish Defense Forces. 
 The Finns also understand the importance of crisis 
management, however: the Finns work closely with NATO 
partners in Afghanistan and the Balkans, and the GoF has 
committed to joining two EU battle groups -- one with the 
Swedes and Norwegians, and one with the Germans and Dutch -- 
with the stipulation that this effort must be consistent with 
Berlin Plus.  In your conversations in Helsinki, the Finns 
are likely to ask for your assessment of the direction in 
which the Alliance is moving, and the role that they can play 
in it, short of actual membership, and the future of NATO\'s 
relations with the EU.  End Summary. 
 
The White Paper 
--------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Your visit to Finland takes place shortly after the 
GoF\'s much anticipated White Paper on national security 
policy was completed and sent to Parliament for its review in 
September.  Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja told EUR 
Assistant Secretary Beth Jones on Nov. 8 (see reftel) that he 
expected the Parliament to approve the report\'s main outline 
with only minor revisions.  The White Paper reaffirms 
Finland\'s nonalignment, although \"applying for membership in 
the (NATO) Alliance will remain a possibility...in the 
future.\"  The White Paper has since been criticized by some 
of the country\'s most committed trans-Atlanticists for being 
too timid in its treatment of Finland\'s need for allies.  One 
commentator said that the White Paper was \"born old\" in 
failing to note the modern realities in Russia.  MP Liisa 
Jaakonsaari, the Social Democratic Party\'s chair of the 
Foreign Relations Committee, has said that Finland\'s foreign 
policy lacks direction. 
 
3.  (C)  This criticism seems to have gained some traction: 
at a Nov. 8 dinner in honor of A/S Jones, LGEN Ahola, 
second-ranking MoD official, told the Ambassador that some 
consideration is being given to changing \"a possibility\" to 
\"a real option,\" more in line with the last White Paper, 
issued in 2001. 
 
4.  (C)  Public opinion, however, remains strongly against 
NATO membership.  By early 2003, support for joining the 
Alliance had struggled up to 20%, or even higher in some 
polls, but it plummeted to near zero after the onset of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom.  A recent poll found over 80% of 
respondents still opposed the idea, although most wanted the 
door to NATO left open.  If Finland\'s political leadership 
were to recommend that Finns walk through that door, the 
nation probably would do so, but there is no indication this 
will happen in the foreseeable future.  In fact, Foreign 
Minister Tuomioja told us last year that he did not expect 
the NATO question to arise during this Parliamentary term 
(2003-2007).  Despite this, Finland clearly sees NATO as the 
foundation for trans-Atlantic security, and Finland has made 
NATO interoperability one of the guiding principles of its 
military.  The Finns are among the most active participants 
in the PfP, and welcomed the Baltic States\' entry into the 
Alliance.  The White Paper states that \"Finland considers a 
strong trans-Atlantic relationship to be important for the 
security of Europe.\"  Finland can be expected to foster that 
relationship on a bilateral basis with the U.S., as well as 
through the EU and the PfP. 
 
Russia 
------ 
 
5.  (C)  Russia obviously figures prominently in Finnish 
foreign policy.  The stability of political and commercial 
relations with Russia -- and therefore the stability of 
Russia itself -- will always be of vital importance to the 
Finns.  In recent conversations, they have said that while 
day-to-day interactions with the Russians continue on track, 
Finns are concerned about long-term trends.  Foreign Minister 
Tuomioja told the Ambassador in September, in the wake of the 
changes made by Putin after the Beslan tragedy, that he was 
worried that Putin seemed to be relying more and more on 
people who are not by inclination natural democrats. 
Tuomioja also told A/S Jones on November 8 that Russia was 
trying to drive wedges between EU members on certain issues, 
and clearly did not understand how the EU worked or that 
Finland was now an integral EU member and not a \"bridge\" 
between Russia and the Union. 
 
Territorial Defense 
------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  The White Paper also reaffirmed Finland\'s 
long-standing policy that territorial defense is the primary 
mission of Finland\'s armed forces.  Finnish defense strategy 
is based on maintaining the capability to muster a credible 
deterrent force of approximately 350,000 troops to counter 
any Russian threat.  To that end, a system of universal male 
conscription is in place.  Concerns about the compatibility 
of Finland\'s territorial defense strategy with the demands of 
NATO membership and/or participation in collective EU defense 
structures are frequently raised by detractors of both 
concepts.  NATO and the envisaged EU force are looking more 
at an enhanced ability to rapidly project military force 
abroad, requiring members to reconfigure their armed forces 
accordingly.  Some Finns fear that overhauling the Finnish 
military along these lines could jeopardize Finland\'s ability 
to credibly field a conventional territorial defense of the 
country vis-a-vis Russia.  In addition, PolDir Lyra worries 
that NATO planners are pressing the three Baltic nations too 
hard to shift capabilities away from territorial defense, 
leaving the possibility of \"a security vacuum in the Baltic.\" 
 
Battle-Groups 
------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Finnish defense officials are formulating a plan for 
Finnish participation in EU battle-groups.  The White Paper 
commits the nation for the first time to providing combat 
troops to EU rapid reaction forces.  Tentative plans call for 
between 300-400 Finnish troops to be divided between a 
\"Nordic\" battle-group led by Sweden and including Norway, and 
a German-Dutch group.  The Finns tell us they were able to 
win Greek agreement to including Norway in the battle-group 
only after Finnish and Swedish officials went to Athens last 
week to appeal directly to the Greek Government. 
 
8.  (C)  The Finnish troops in the \"Nordic\" group would be 
primarily ancillary and support types, while those in the 
German-Dutch group would be special forces.  However, Finland 
maintains only a small standing military of about 8,000 
professionals, plus about 15,000 conscripts in training for 
six months.  The bulk of Finland\'s military strength lies in 
reserves.  Finnish politicians want to have a force of 
several hundred troops ready to deploy with an EU 
battle-group on five-days notice, without increasing the size 
of the \"standing army.\"  One possible solution might be to 
maintain a core of soldiers who would remain de facto 
reserves for one year after conscript service. 
 
NATO Interoperability 
--------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Finland is committed to being interoperable with 
NATO, and already is to a remarkable extent.  For example, in 
the last 18 months, Finland  has held the role, for two 
six-month periods, as the Framework Nation for the 
Multi-National Brigade Center in Kosovo.  However, there are 
other areas where Finland has a ways to go as regards 
interoperability.  One in particular is with its Air Force. 
The FiAF\'s 63 F-18 Hornets are superb air defense fighters; 
however, their datalink systems not compatible with NATO. 
The Finns have decided to cease further development of their 
unique datalink and spend scarce defense dollars on a 
\"dumbed-down,\" less capable system that is NATO compatible. 
It is not yet clear whether this system will be operational 
by 2008, when the White Paper states Finland will be prepared 
to offer its F-18s for international crisis 
management/peacekeeping operations. 
 
Landmines 
--------- 
 
10.  (C)  The White Paper commits Finland to signing the 
Ottawa Convention by 2012, and destroying its anti-personnel 
landmines (APLs) by 2016.  This has been one of the most 
controversial decisions in the White Paper, and in the 
subsequent Parliamentary review has been criticized from the 
left and the right.  Finland\'s Left Alliance (which includes 
the Communists, as well as a range of more moderate political 
figures) argued that the nation should stay with the original 
compromise of the 2001 White Paper, in which the government 
committed to joining Ottawa in 2006 -- if doing so would not 
harm national security -- while Conservative MPs argued that 
Finland should not give up APLs at all.  Ministry officials 
tell us that the White Paper decision was a hard-fought 
compromise among MFA, MoD, and the Ministry of Finance (which 
must find the necessary millions of Euros to purchase 
replacement systems), and is unlikely to change. 
 
Your Meeting at the MFA 
----------------------- 
 
11.  (C)  Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs 
Jaakko Laajava will leave Helsinki next month to become 
Finland\'s Ambassador to the United Kingdom.  The current 
Director General for Political Affairs, Markus Lyra, will 
move up to replace him at the MFA.  You may wish to 
congratulate both on their new appointments.  Laajava has 
been Finland\'s ambassador to the U.S., and is regarded as the 
MFA\'s premier Americanist.  He is known to be close to former 
PM Paavo Lipponen, whose support for NATO membership is a 
poorly-kept secret in Finnish politics.  Laajava himself 
supports NATO accession, although, given the Foreign 
Minister\'s position and prevailing public opinion, he is 
usually measured in his comments.  He will probably provide 
an overview of Finland\'s White Paper (stressing NATO 
interoperability), and discuss plans for Finnish 
participation in the EU battle-groups.  The Under Secretary 
may be interested in hearing about ongoing NATO operations in 
Afghanistan, and about the recent decision concerning NATO 
and troop training in Iraq.  (NOTE:  Finland has pledged 1 
million Euros to help fund a UN Protection Force in Iraq, but 
bureaucratic problems in New York over the creation of a UN 
trust fund to manage the money has held up the project, and 
no funds have been disbursed.) 
 
Your Meeting at the Ministry for Defense 
---------------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C)  Your one hour meeting at the MoD will be split 
between a roundtable discussion with MoD policy makers, and a 
meeting with the Defense Minister, Seppo Kaariainen.  The 
roundtable discussion will be led by MoD Policy Director Dr. 
Pauli Jarvenpaa.  Jarvenpaa knows you from previous 
encounters, and he is a strong advocate of the trans-Atlantic 
link.  Kaariainen has been Defense Minister for a little over 
a year, and during that time he has significantly softened 
the overtly isolationist agenda he brought to the office. 
However, he is a politician who focuses on domestic issues. 
Our best hope with him is for incremental gains.  You might 
take the opportunity to thank Finland for its work in 
Afghanistan (18 members in a PRT; 6 military firefighters at 
Kabul airport; approximately 46 CIMIC specialists in Kabul); 
and its work in Kosovo and in helping to coordinate the EU 
takeover from NATO in Bosnia.  He would probably also 
appreciate hearing about NATO cooperation with the EU, and 
with Russia.

REF: STATE 258831 
 
Classified By: POL Chief John Hall for reasons 1.5(B) and (D) 
 
1. (U) We met with Finnish MFA EU Correspondent Kimmo 
Lahdevirta to discuss the agenda for next week\'s GAERC 
meeting and the European Council meeting to follow.  Finnish 
views, by issue: 
 
2. (C) China Arms Embargo: Lahdevirta said his understanding 
is that the EU has reached consensus on revisions to the Code 
of Conduct, except for two issues: a difference of views 
regarding the primacy of national law in some cases, and 
whether to make the Code legally binding.  He opined that the 
first issue ought to be resolved fairly easily, but the 
second is much more difficult and may have to be carried over 
into Luxembourg\'s presidency.  Finland strongly favors making 
the Code legally binding, he said, but \"a whole host of 
others\" are opposed.  The GoF, Lahdevirta added, has not 
wanted to link lifting of the embargo with completion of work 
on the Code of Conduct.  We said this did not seem logical -- 
if the Finns want a legally binding Code of Conduct, one 
would think that the best tactic to get it would be to insist 
on the embargo staying in place until their demand is met. 
 
3. (C) Ukraine: Lahdevirta agreed that the EU and the U.S. 
are on the same wavelength regarding the election and 
post-election developments.  He remarked that the 
demonstrations in Kiev clearly show strong pro-change, 
pro-modernization sentiments, but do not necessarily show a 
pro-Western feeling.  In any case, he said, the Finns are 
pleased and relieved that so far there has been no bloodshed, 
and feel it is \"important to emphasize the integrity of 
Ukraine against any secession.\"  The GoF wonders if enough 
time remains to complete the technical arrangements for a new 
vote on December 26, but if the vote is held, it is important 
that Western nations field as many observers as possible. 
Finland is considering on a national basis whether it can 
increase its own contribution. 
 
4. (C) Middle East: Lahdevirta did not see any difference 
between EU views and the U.S. position of reftel.  In 
particular, he agreed that the Palestinian Authority must be 
headed by a legitimate leadership, and must show that it can 
work.  It is also important that Israel and the Palestinians 
cooperate on planning for Gaza withdrawal, \"so that no 
vaccuum develops between them.\" 
 
5. (C) Iran: Lahdevirta said he expected the GAERC to 
reassert the necessity for Iran to stick to its commitments 
-- and for the international community to be given the 
opportunity to verify that.  Iran must understand that 
without such verification, there is no possibility of 
anything happening on the \"carrot\" side.  He said it seems it 
will take quite some time before things change for the better 
in Iranian society -- although on the other hand, events in 
Ukraine show that change can happen rapidly. 
 
6. (C) Turkey: Lahdevirta said the Finns expect Turkey and 
Croatia to be the most sensitive issues at the European 
Council meeting.  The Finns are cautiously optimistic that 
the Council will agree to begin accession talks for Turkey, 
although the date remains up in the air.  In any case, the 
firm GoF view is that the question before the EU is 
negotiation on full Turkish membership, not on some lesser 
status.  Lahdevirta remarked that a Turkish indication of 
willingness to recognize Cyprus would obviously be an 
important step that would certainly help \"pave the way.\" 
 
7. (C) Croatia: Drawing on reftel points, we stressed the 
need to keep the pressure on Croatia to cooperate with the 
ICTY.  The Finns expect that the idea of agreeing to set a 
date for negotiations, but making it conditional on 
cooperation with ICTY, will be acceptable to a majority of EU 
nations -- but perhaps not all.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) U.S. Ambassador to NATO R. Nicholas Burns visited 
Helsinki November 29-30.  Following remarks given to the 
Atlantic Council of Finland at a seminar on NATO and small 
nations, Ambassador Burns participated in meetings with 
Minister of Defense Seppo Kaariainen and MFA Under Secretary 
for Political Affairs Jaakko Laajava.  He also addressed NATO 
Ambassadors at the Estonian Embassy and participated in press 
interviews.  End Summary. 
 
Atlantic Council Seminar 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Ambassador Burns spoke in Helsinki on November 29 in a 
seminar organized by the Atlantic Council of Finland, to an 
audience of 170 leading foreign policy experts and 
commentators.  His audience also included a sizable group of 
students from the National Defense College.  The title of the 
seminar was \"Small States and NATO.\"  Ambassador Burns also 
gave an interview to Finland\'s leading daily, independent 
Helsingin Sanomat (circulation 440,000) which was published 
on November 30.  The Finnish Broadcasting Company\'s senior 
diplomatic correspondent also taped an interview with 
Ambassador Burns to air as part of an upcoming Sunday morning 
talk show.  In his speech and in the newspaper interview, 
Ambassador Burns stressed Finland\'s contributions to NATO-led 
operations as a PfP country, praising Finland\'s (and 
Sweden\'s) conceptual leadership role in the PfP program.  He 
noted that NATO membership is an issue for Finns to decide, 
suggested that some Finns\' and Swedes\' Cold War conception of 
NATO is outdated, and described the new NATO as a democratic, 
stronger, and more flexible alliance.  In the newspaper 
interview, Ambassador Burns discussed the possibility of 
non-allies participating in NATO\'s Response Force (NRF) and 
praised Finland\'s participation in peacekeeping in Kosovo, 
Afghanistan and elsewhere. 
 
MFA Meeting 
----------- 
 
3. (U) At the Foreign Ministry, Ambassador Burns met with 
Jaakko Laajava, Under Secretary for Political Affairs (and 
Ambassador-designate to the UK); Pilvi-Sisko 
Vierros-Villeneuve, Director of the Arms Control Unit (and 
Political Director-Designate); and Elina Kalkku, Director of 
the Security Policy Unit.  Ambassador Burns was accompanied 
by Ambassador Mack, POL Chief Hall, and Executive Assistant 
Barrett. 
 
4. (U) Ambassador Burns began by thanking Finland for what it 
is doing in NATO, particularly in the Balkans and 
Afghanistan.  All non-member nations who contribute troops to 
NATO-led operations now are present at meetings related to 
those operations, which is as it should be. 
 
5. (SBU) Ambassador Burns emphasized that President Bush sees 
NATO as \"absolutely vital\", and is a strong believer in 
giving the Partnership for Peace a greater say in decision 
making.  Burns called Laajava\'s attention to the President\'s 
November 19, 2003 Whitehall address, an important speech in 
which the President acknowledged America\'s commitment to NATO 
and other multilateral institutions.  He also noted that NATO 
SYG de Hoop Scheffer was the first foreign visitor to the 
Oval Office after President Bush won re-election -- another 
sign of U.S. commitment to NATO.  Moreover, the President\'s 
first official trip abroad after the State of the Union 
Address will be to Brussels for a NATO summit in early 
February; NATO-EU meetings will also take place. 
 
6. (U) Burns said that some in Europe assume NATO is a Cold 
War institution.  That characterization is no longer 
accurate.  The transformation of NATO, from an American 
perspective, has been strongly due to the course of events 
after September 11, 2001, and to the evolution in military 
technology, which is far advanced from the Cold War. 
President Bush\'s multilateral vision for NATO that he laid 
out at the NATO Summit in Istanbul this past June includes 
integrating the two military missions, OEF and ISAF, in 
Afghanistan; collective training conducted by NATO in Iraq; 
and NATO\'s Istanbul Cooperation Initiative for outreach to 
the Arab world. 
 
7. (U) Burns explained that there is strong bipartisan 
support for NATO in the U.S.  While nations still believe the 
U.S. is using NATO as a \"tool box,\" the U.S. has been the 
prime proponent of NATO reform and for greater NATO roles in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.  As the Alliance focuses on its 2005 
agenda, we want to put Trans-Atlantic differences behind us 
and move forward. 
 
8. (C) Asked by Under Secretary Laajava whether the U.S. is 
pleased with the condition of the Alliance, Ambassador Burns 
said that on the political side the right decisions are being 
made -- new members are being taken in and NATO is reforming 
its relations with Russia.  But on the military side the gap 
is wide, particularly in the area of capabilities.  The U.S. 
defense budget is more than twice that of the other Allies 
put together.  NATO members\' defense spending should be 
around two percent of GDP, yet many countries (Canada, Spain, 
Germany, the Netherlands, and others) are below this level. 
Eleven members spend more than 60 percent of their defense 
budgets on personnel costs alone.  And Lord Robertson 
estimated that of the 2.4 million men and women in uniform in 
Europe, only three-five percent can be deployed beyond their 
borders.  As a result, more and more of the burden is borne 
by the U.S., UK, France, Norway, and others.  With the U.S. 
deeply committed to Iraq, other nations have had to take up 
more of the burden in Afghanistan -- where the European 
allies have been slow to deploy.  Laajava agreed, recalling 
the difficulty in finding the helicopters to deploy Finnish 
troops to the PRT in Meymaneh, Afghanistan. 
 
9. (SBU) Ambassador Mack raised the point of the current 
legislation under consideration in the Finnish Parliament to 
amend the peacekeeping law to permit troop deployment based 
on an EU mandate.  Political Director-designate 
Vierros-Villeneuve said Parliament seems to favor changing 
the legislation in regards to an EU mandate.  Burns said we 
applaud the formation of EU battlegroups, if they allow 
Europe to be more proficient.  But if they begin to undercut 
the NATO Response Force -- the largest NATO reform in recent 
years -- then there will be problems.  Security Policy 
Director Kalkku said it will be necessary to ensure that the 
same unit does not serve standby duty for a battlegroup and 
for the NRF consecutively. 
 
10. (C) In discussing the NATO-EU relationship, Ambassador 
Burns described it as a symbiotic relationship in some ways, 
where 19 of the 25 EU nations are also NATO members.  He said 
the U.S. strongly supports EU giving ESDP greater identity, 
\"and if it leads to greater capabilities, we\'ll be 
delighted.\"  Problems arise when some in Europe, such as 
French President Chirac, would like to turn the EU into a 
strategic counterweight to the U.S.  These attempts to make 
the EU and NATO competitive make the relationship difficult 
and would be resisted by Europeans like Denmark, Norway, the 
UK, and Italy. 
 
11. (C) Laajava remarked that he had encountered \"quite 
strong sentiments\" in Congress on this issue when he was 
Ambassador to the U.S.  He affirmed that it is important to 
shift attention to focus on the world\'s real problems instead 
of criticizing institutions.  Burns said that NATO has to 
remain the pre-eminent Trans-Atlantic security institution, 
which will lead it to even greater capabilities.  Laajava was 
supportive to say that Finland\'s way is to generate and 
gather positive identification with the EU.  During the Cold 
War, identification was close to home for Finland.  Now, 
Finland finds that identification and political capital are 
with the EU. 
 
12. (C) Afghanistan: Burns said he did not think the NATO 
mission has deployed as fast and strong as we had hoped. NATO 
has not succeeded in raising troops for an expansion to 
western Afghanistan.  Its shortfalls make clear that without 
a U.S. lead ISAF has been severely hampered.  But he hoped to 
see improvements in 2005.  The upcoming NATO Defense 
Ministers\' meeting in Nice in February will be a forum where 
these issues will begin to be addressed, with the goal of 
unifying the OEF and ISAF operations under a single NATO 
command by the summer.  Kalkku asked about operational 
procedures for combining the operations.  Burns said one 
option was to create two task forces under one mission.  This 
will make matters easier for Germany.  \"And for us,\" said 
Kalkku. 
 
13. (C) Burns reassured Laajava that NATO will have a full 
set of options by the Nice meeting, and encouraged the Finns 
to get involved in the debate.  It will be important for 
contributing countries such as Finland, Sweden, New Zealand, 
and Japan to be at the table in the larger troop-contributing 
country meetings as we discuss this in 2005.  Laajava thanked 
Burns and underscored the importance that public perception 
be shaped the right way. 
 
14. (C) Kosovo: In answer to a question from Kalkku, Burns 
highlighted the U.S. commitment to KFOR.  The upcoming spring 
periodic mission review will decide whether to break down the 
four quadrants.  The allies do not want to see significant 
troop reductions, although some support personnel could be 
moved over the horizon to improve KFOR\'s tooth-to-tail ratio. 
 Burns said the Allied commanders had been very disappointed 
in the way some nations\' troops had performed in March, and 
this has led to a focus on national caveats.  But the 
commanders had also praised the Finnish, Swedish, U.S., and 
Norwegian troops, who did not hesitate to act. 
 
15. (C) Iraq: Ambassador Burns said the U.S. is \"absolutely 
determined\" to stay the course.  The President is committed 
and there is strong public support for the war against 
terrorism.  Ambassador Burns asked Laajava what the 
benchmarks would be for Finland to make additional 
contributions to Iraq -- either humanitarian, financial, or 
military assistance.  Laajava hesitated to respond and said 
that they will wait to see what Iraqi elections delivered. 
Ambassador Mack recalled that Finland had been one of the 
first countries to contribute to the UN Protection Force, 
pledging one million euros this past September.  Kalkku said 
the EU is considering a civilian mission, and the GoF might 
contribute civilian rule-of-law experts to that. 
 
16. (C) The U.S. is committed to a NATO role in Iraq.  NATO 
has begun training Iraqi officers in Baghdad, said Burns. 
After elections in Iraq, the U.S. hopes more countries will 
join this effort to train senior Iraqi officers.  Partnership 
for Peace countries are welcome to participate. 
 
17. (U) Partnership for Peace (PfP): Ambassador Burns 
stressed that the future of PfP is promising, with countries 
like Finland and Sweden as the intellectual driving force, 
and he thanked Laajava for the joint paper on PfP options 
that the two countries had contributed.  NATO is looking to 
Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Middle East as new areas 
for an expanded partnership.  This conceptual, intellectual 
leadership of Finland is instrumental to developing PfP 
leadership. 
 
18. (U) NATO-Russia: Ambassador Burns said the U.S. is 
convinced that we must keep working with Russia, including 
within NATO at the NATO-Russian Council.  The NATO-Russia 
agenda has focused so far on Russia\'s Istanbul Commitments in 
Georgia and Moldova, and lately on Ukraine.  There is ongoing 
cooperation on issues of common concern such as theater 
missile defense and protecting civilian populations against 
chemical attack. 
 
MoD Meeting 
----------- 
 
19. (SBU) At the Ministry of Defense, Ambassador Burns first 
participated in a roundtable discussion with senior MoD 
officials, then met with the Minister.  Finnish participants 
in the roundtable included: 
Lt. General (ret.) Matti Ahola, MoD Permanent Secretary; 
Pauli Jarvenpaa, Director General for Policy; Jyrkki Iivonen, 
MoD Public Affairs Director; Colonel Sakari Honkamaa, Finnish 
Defense Staff; Colonel Arto Raty, Director of the National 
Defense Course; and Karolina Honkanen, MoD Researcher and 
author of a study on small states in NATO. 
 
20. (C) The Finns began the roundtable by asking Ambassador 
Burns how the second Bush Administration would approach NATO, 
and in general what would be the Administration\'s posture 
toward Europe.  The Ambassador replied by first thanking the 
Finns for their contributions to NATO in Bosnia, Kosovo, and 
Afghanistan.  He said that it was important to think about 
how PfP countries could be \"at the table\" more to inform NATO 
decision-making.  Burns said that the past two years had been 
rocky ones for NATO and for Trans-Atlantic relations. 
However, he believed that the debate was turning away from 
one about the action in Iraq to one over how best to 
stabilize the situation there and help the Iraqi people.  The 
Administration was interested in moving forward, not dwelling 
on the past two years, and the Ambassador opined that 2005 
should be a much better year and renew the close 
Trans-Atlantic ties that were valued by all.  Pointing to the 
President\'s trip to Brussels in February, he said that the 
President was serious about reaching out to friends and 
allies, and that the U.S. was not interested in \"going it 
alone.\"  Dr. Jarvenpaa replied that these were \"encouraging 
words.\" 
 
21. (C) Iivonen asked the Ambassador for his assessment of 
the Russia-NATO and Russia-U.S. relationship.  The Ambassador 
said that the U.S. had a realistic view of Russia and was 
watching recent developments closely.  However, he said that 
the West had to maintain a strategic relationship with Russia 
and that it would be dangerous to ignore or isolate Moscow. 
Burns cited several examples of NATO-Russian cooperation, 
including the theater-missile defense system project, 
counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, civil emergency 
coordination, and maritime search and rescue cooperation. 
However, the Ambassador said that neither the U.S. nor NATO 
was uncritical of the situations in Chechnya, Georgia, 
Moldova or Ukraine; what was important was to engage the 
Russians on these issues rather than isolate them. 
 
22. (C) During the roundtable, Dr. Jarvenpaa noted that the 
capabilities of the EU battlegroups are not very challenging 
-- he called them \"light groups, with simple capability.\"  He 
said Finland wants close cooperation between the battlegroups 
and the NRF.  The Finns indicated some frustration with the 
negotiations on the battlegroups, suggesting that the EU\'s 
limited military capability meant that the debate over the 
battlegroups was more over process than designing a system 
with real military value.  Ambassador Burns said that the 
U.S. supported the concept of EU battlegroups as long as they 
were consistent with the Berlin Plus agreements and not in 
conflict with NATO resource needs.  The Ambassador cited the 
abortive EU military headquarters planning cell proposal in 
April 2003 as unhelpful.  He said that it should be possible 
to deconflict NATO and EU defense policies, but that it 
wouldn\'t happen without the two institutions talking about 
problems areas, and that as regards battlegroups, NATO 
couldn\'t even get the issue on the agenda with the EU because 
of Cypriot objections. 
 
23. (SBU) Ahola referred to a statement the previous week by 
the Finnish Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Committee which 
recommended that the government should call NATO membership a 
\"real option\", rather than just a \"possibility.\"  He also 
said that a new official poll had found support by the 
Finnish population for NATO membership had grown to 34 
percent.  He saw this as very good news, noting that the 
all-time low had been 11 percent. 
 
24. (C) After the Roundtable, Ambassador Burns had an office 
call with Minister of Defense Seppo Kaariainen.  The Minister 
spoke warmly about his visit to the U.S. in April 2004, and 
noted that he found particularly interesting the briefings on 
transformation he got at the Joint Forces Command and 
Pentagon.  He said he took to heart a quote, \"It is not 
enough to make things better, we must make better things.\" 
Kaariainen said Parliament\'s review of the Security and 
Defense Policy White Paper will be completed by the third 
week of December.  It is his impression that the White Paper 
is \"very European\", emphasizing that Finland will participate 
fully in the ESDP.  The EU has made very fast progress on 
many defense issues, including battlegroups, headline goals, 
and Operation ALTHEA.  Finland\'s aim is to \"participate 
fully, without conditions.\" 
 
25. (C) Kaariainen also emphasized the importance Finland 
puts on the Trans-Atlantic link and relations with the U.S. 
-- through NATO, through the EU, and bilaterally.  He said, 
\"In some areas, we are natural competitors, but we need to 
work together on crisis management.\"  He noted that the White 
Paper lists NATO \"as an option in the future\" and that for 
now Finland has a very practical relationship with NATO, 
particularly with cooperation in the Balkans and Afghanistan. 
 Kaariainen noted that Finland has good relations with 
Russia, especially in the area of trade.  He noted the 
particular economic importance of the St. Petersburg area to 
Finland.  He added there is a need for \"clear rules\" for Air 
Policing, for example air traffic control procedures, and 
that NATO\'s new relationship in the Baltics has \"stabilized\" 
the Baltic Sea region.

TAGS: KCRM, PTER, KSEP, SNAR, KTFN, EFIN, FI 
SUBJECT: MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL CRIMES IN FINLAND: 
SUBMISSION TO PART II OF 2004-2005 INCSR 
 
 
1. Summary:  The following is Embassy Helsinki\'s submission 
to the money laundering and financial crimes section of the 
2004-2005 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 
(INCSR). End summary. 
 
-------- 
Overview 
-------- 
2. Finland is not a regional center for money laundering, 
financial crime or illegal commerce. A \"Corruption 
Perceptions Index\" survey taken by Transparency 
International, which evaluates countries based on experts\' 
perceptions of corruption, ranked Finland in first place as 
the country perceived around the world to be the least 
corrupt. Nonetheless, Finnish authorities are concerned 
about links to organized crime, as well as money laundering 
arising from fraud or other economic crime. To date, no 
Finnish (or Finland-based) individuals or organizations have 
been suspected of financing terrorism. 
 
3. The Money Laundering Clearing House (MLCH), established 
under the National Bureau of Investigation in March 1998, 
receives and investigates reports of suspicious transactions 
from obligated reporting institutions. The Clearing House 
has authority to initiate investigations before the basis of 
a pre-trial investigation has been established. The Clearing 
House also has the ability to freeze a transaction for up to 
five business days in order to determine the legitimacy of 
the funds. The responsibilities of the Clearing House were 
expanded in 2003 to include the prevention of terrorist 
financing. 
 
4. The Clearing House received 4,132 suspicious transaction 
reports (STRs) in 2004, 2,716 in 2003, 2,718 in 2002, and 
2,796 in 2001. A majority of the reports-roughly four- 
fifths-concerned money laundering; the remainder consisted 
mostly of U.S., EU and/or UN designations of entities 
suspected of terrorist financing. Of the cases forwarded to 
pre-trial criminal investigation, the most common offenses 
were tax fraud (25 percent), narcotics offenses (13 
percent), fraud (12 percent) and receiving offense (11 
percent). 
 
5. Money laundering represents about 10 percent of all 
financial crime in Finland. Financial crime--not limited to 
money laundering--has remained steady over the past three 
years (approximately 1600 cases per year). As of the 
preparation of this report, no information is available on 
the number of arrests and/or prosecutions for money 
laundering in 2004. However, the scale of the problem is 
relatively minor. Between 1994-2002, 93 people were arrested 
for money laundering. Of those, 83 people were convicted. 
 
6. A majority of STRs involve at least one foreign party. 
Nationals from 84 countries were mentioned in the reports. 
To some extent, this internationalization is due to the 
receipt of terrorist financing related STRs. Of the money 
laundering STRs, the most-represented suspect nationalities 
were Finnish (48%), Russian (16.5%), Estonian (4.8%) and 
Swedish (1.6%). Criminal proceeds laundered in Finland 
derive mainly from domestic criminal activity. Local 
narcotics trafficking organizations as well as a small 
number of local organized crime groups control some of the 
money-laundering proceeds. 
 
7. Of all the reporting agencies, currency exchange 
companies are the most active in reporting suspicious 
transactions, accounting for 70% of all money laundering 
STR\'s. Other reporting entities include banks (19%), non- 
Police national authorities such as Customs and the Frontier 
Guard (7%) and insurance companies (1%). Reports from the 
National Police account for approximately 0.6% of all STR\'s. 
The Act on Preventing and Clearing Money Laundering protects 
individuals that cooperate with law enforcement entities. 
 
8. Money laundering occasionally occurs within offshore 
financial centers. Finland has not enacted secrecy laws that 
prevent disclosure of client and ownership information by 
domestic and offshore financial services companies to bank 
supervisors and law enforcement authorities. Finland does 
not have any cross-border transaction reporting 
requirements. However, Finnish authorities have addressed 
the problem of the international transportation of illegal 
source currency and monetary instruments in the Customs Act 
(sections 13-20). 
 
9. No Finnish entities or officials are known to encourage, 
facilitate or engage in laundering the proceeds from illegal 
drug transactions, from other serious crimes, or from 
terrorist financing. Neither have there been any reports of 
Finland\'s financial institutions engaging in currency 
transactions involving international narcotics trafficking 
proceeds that include significant amounts of United States 
currency or currency derived from illegal drug sales in the 
United States. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Money Laundering & Financial Crimes Legislation 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
10. In 1994, Finland enacted legislation criminalizing money 
laundering related to all serious crimes. The Act of 
Preventing and Clearing Money Laundering (Money Laundering 
Act), which passed in 1998, compels credit and financial 
institutions, investment and fund management companies, 
insurance brokers and insurance companies, real estate 
agents, pawn shops, betting services, casinos, and most non- 
bank financial institutions to report suspicious 
transactions. Management companies and custodians of mutual 
funds were added as covered entities in the Money Laundering 
Act in 1999. 
 
11. Apartment rental agencies, auditors, auctioneers, 
lawyers, accountants, and dealers in high value goods were 
added when amendments to the Act came into force in 2003. 
Also included are the businesses and professions that 
practice other payment transfers in the field of financing 
that are not referred to in the Credit Institutions Act, 
such as \"hawala.\" According to the Money Laundering Act, an 
obliged party must identify customers, exercise due 
diligence and report suspicious activity. 
 
12. In December 2002 the Parliament accepted amendments to 
the Penal Code, which came into force on April 1, 2003. The 
amendments included the differentiation of penalty 
provisions concerning money laundering and traditional 
receiving offense in order to clarify the law where some 
actions could be punishable on the basis of both the 
receiving offense and money laundering penalty provisions, 
and to emphasize in legislation the criminality of money 
laundering and its relevance to serious organized crime. 
Prior to the amendments, the definition of money laundering 
was limited only to property gained through crime. 
 
13. The new amendments expand the definition to include 
negligence and the usage or transmission of property gained 
through an offense and its proceeds or property replacing 
such property, as well as bringing under the law those who 
assist in activities of concealment or laundering. With the 
differentiation of money laundering from the traditional 
receiving offense, the receiving offense penal scale now 
corresponds to the basic penal scale of other economic 
offenses, and the money laundering penal scale is set to 
meet international standards, with sanctions of up to six 
years of imprisonment. 
 
------------------------- 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
------------------------- 
14. Finland is a member of the Financial Action Task Force 
(FATF) and the Council of Europe. The MLCH is a member of 
the Egmont Group. Finland also cooperates with the European 
Union, Europol, the United Nations, Interpol, the Baltic Sea 
Task Force, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development and other international agencies designed to 
combat organized crime. Finland is a party to the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention and has signed the UN Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime. Finland is also a party to 
the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, 
Seizure, and Confiscation of Proceeds from Crime. 
 
15. Finland has enacted laws for the sharing with other 
governments of seized narcotics assets, as well as the 
assets from other serious crimes. Finland is party to the 
Vienna and Strasbourg Conventions, and has signed the 
European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal 
Matters, under which other countries may be afforded a 
considerable amount of legal assistance. Finland has also 
concluded numerous bilateral law enforcement cooperation 
agreements. In September 1989, Finland signed a tax treaty 
with the United States, replacing a previous treaty signed 
in 1970. The current treaty has provisions to exchange 
information for investigative purposes. 
 
16. The MLCH may exchange information with other Financial 
Intelligence Units (FIUs) and with bodies engaged in 
criminal investigations, such as police services and public 
prosecutors. Although no Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
is required for this purpose under Finnish law, MOUs have 
been concluded with Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, 
Korea, Canada, Russia and Albania. The information exchanged 
may only be used for the prevention and clearing of money- 
laundering transactions. Consequently, the information 
obtained may only be used as evidence with the approval of 
the MLCH. 
 
17. The MLCH\'s action in response to a request for 
information on a given person or organization differs from 
case to case. In most cases, the MLCH simply hands over the 
requested information and no other measures are taken. If 
the MLCH has already received a STR related to the person or 
entity, the Anti-Money-Laundering Act allows it to start a 
police investigation. Under the Pre-trial Investigation Act, 
the police must institute an investigation if an offence is 
reported or suspected in Finland. 
 
-------------- 
ASSET FREEZING 
-------------- 
18. From January-November 2004 the Money Laundering Clearing 
House gave 24 orders to freeze assets/suspend transactions. 
The total value of these transactions was $1.7 million (EUR 
1,398,398). With these orders, the Money Laundering Clearing 
House recovered $630,000 of criminal proceeds. Most cases 
involved money laundering and financial crime. In 2003, the 
Clearing House gave 16 orders to freeze assets/suspend 
transactions. The total value of these transactions was 
approximately $1.8 million, a significant increase from 2002 
($900,000) and 2001 ($720,000). With these orders, 
authorities recovered criminal proceeds totaling over $1.5 
million (compared to approximately $5,000 in 2002 and 
$650,000 in 2001). 
 
19. According to the Penal Code Chapter 10 Section 2, the 
proceeds of crime shall be given to the injured party. If a 
claim for compensation or restitution has not been filed, 
Finnish authorities can order forfeiture. With some 
exceptions, only the proceeds of a crime can be forfeited. 
Legitimate businesses can be seized if used to launder drug 
money or support terrorist activity. 
 
20. Finnish authorities do not have national authority to 
permanently suspend transactions or forfeit assets 
independent of a judicial process. Although the authority to 
freeze assets rests with the National Bureau of 
Investigation, officials at the MLCH consult and coordinate 
with other branches of government, including the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry 
of Finance. 
 
------------------------------- 
Terrorist Financing Legislation 
------------------------------- 
21. Finland became a party to the UN International 
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism 
on June 28, 2002. The penal code of Finland was amended at 
the end of 2002 with the addition of a new chapter on 
terrorism (Chapter 34 a). According to Section 5 of the 
amendment, a person who directly or indirectly provides or 
collects funds in order to finance a terrorist act or who is 
aware that these funds shall finance a terrorist act, 
commits a punishable offence. 
 
22. In January 2003 the Parliament accepted amendments to 
the Money Laundering Act bringing it in line with the FATF 
Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing, the UN 
International Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism and the amendments to the EU 
Directive on Money Laundering. 
 
23. Finland has national authority to freeze terrorist 
assets. The Money Laundering Clearing House performs 
investigations on all individuals suspected of financing 
terrorist acts, including all individuals and entities on 
the UN 1267 sanctions committee\'s consolidated list. To date 
no Finns have been suspected of financing terrorism and no 
funds of foreign nationals suspected of terrorist financing 
have been located in Finland. In the event that funds are 
found, the assets could be frozen without undue delay for 
five business days. For the funds to remain frozen, a 
criminal investigation must be launched (either in Finland 
or abroad). The funds would remain frozen for the period of 
the investigation. 
 
---------------- 
Free Trade Zones 
---------------- 
24. Finland has four Free Zones and seven Free Warehouse 
areas. The four designated Free Zones are located in Hanko 
(southern Customs District), Hamina and Lappeenranta 
(Eastern customs district), and Turku (Western Customs 
District). The seven Free Warehouses are located in Helsinki 
(southern customs district), Naantali, Pori, Rauma, Vaasa 
(Western Customs District), Kemi and Oulu (Northern customs 
district). 
 
25. In Finland, the duty-free free zone and warehouse 
licenses have in most cases been granted to municipalities 
or cities, but one or several commercial operators, approved 
by the customs districts, are usually in charge of 
warehousing operations within the area. The duty-free 
storage areas are available to both domestic and foreign- 
owned companies. The free zone area regulations have been 
harmonized in the EU by the Community Customs Code. 
 
26. Finnish Free Trade Zones often serve as a transit points 
for shipments of good to and from Russia. Many goods 
originating in East Asia and destined for St. Petersburg or 
Moscow, are transported on the trans-Siberian railway to the 
Lappeenranta Free Trade Zone, where they are temporarily 
stored. These are mostly high-valued goods, whose passage 
offers safety and tax incentives to Russian consumers. There 
are no indications that these zones are being used in trade- 
based money launderings schemes or by the financiers of 
terrorism. There are no supervisory programs and/or due 
diligence procedures in place to monitor activities in the 
free trade zones.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Finnish President Tarja Halonen\'s most recent meeting 
with Vladimir Putin left the Finns with the clear impression 
that the Russian president is feeling frustrated and anxious. 
 He complained at length to Halonen that Russia has been 
misunderstood and mistreated by the West, with an implicit 
accusation that the U.S. is fostering regime change in the 
near abroad with political cover from the EU.  Former PM 
Paavo Lipponen, after discussing the meeting with Halonen, 
described to the Ambassador his own sense that the Russians 
feel under pressure on their perimeter, at least in the 
Baltic and Caucasus; Lipponen advises that the U.S. and EU 
stand firm on principle, as always, but \"bear in mind that 
Putin feels very uncomfortable right now.\" 
 
2. (C) In contrast to the negative vibrations on 
international issues, Putin was upbeat about cooperation with 
Finland, promising to assist with the regional and bilateral 
issues of greatest interest to the Finns.  This is especially 
important to the GoF domestically, given recent charges by 
local critics that Halonen and the Vanhanen government are 
not capable of managing the relationship with Russia. 
Lipponen in particular was happy with Putin\'s positive 
response regarding the Northern Dimension, which the GoF 
believes needs some serious restructuring.  End Summary. 
 
The down side: Russia treated poorly by the West 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. (C) Presidents Halonen and Putin meet roughly once a year 
to discuss bilateral and EU issues.  The most recent meeting 
took place in St. Petersburg on December 14.  We have since 
had read-outs from several different sources here. 
Parliament Speaker (and former PM) Paavo Lipponen discussed 
the summit with Halonen, and passed along his sense of how 
things had gone in a December 17 conversation with the 
Ambassador.  In addition, we spoke with Jarmo Viinanen of 
Halonen\'s staff and MFA Russia unit director Olli Perheentupa. 
 
4. (C) The meeting, we are told, went well on bilateral 
issues.  Putin did not repeat or refer to recent 
Finland-bashing from officials such as EU advisor 
Yastrzhembskiy, who had claimed that Finland belongs to the 
EU\'s Russophobe camp.  Halonen was able to raise the 
questions most urgent for the GoF right now (paras 9-12, 
below), and the two presidents together reaffirmed publicly 
that relations are good.  That statement, and the evidence 
that the relationship is operating normally in most areas, 
helps defend Halonen and the government of PM Matti Vanhanen 
against local critics who have charged that Finland\'s leaders 
don\'t know how to manage relations with Russia. 
 
5. (C) Our Finnish interlocutors tell us that in the meeting 
itself, Putin seemed (in Viinanen\'s words) \"frustrated, 
stressed, and anxious\" -- both about slowness within his own 
bureaucracy and about Russia\'s relations with the West. 
Putin had declined to set a specific agenda for the 
conversation; instead, he spent much of the time complaining, 
with the general theme that Russia has been misunderstood and 
mistreated. 
 
-- According to Viinanen, Putin had critical words for U.S. 
support of the Saakashvili government in Georgia, which came 
to power \"in an illegal way.\"  Although he spoke 
elliptically, he seemed to imply that the United States was 
actively fostering regime change in Russia\'s near abroad, 
with the EU providing political cover.  He seemed to include 
Ukraine in this, although he did not dwell on events there. 
 
-- On Chechnya, Putin said he was sick and tired of being 
told there must be a political solution.  He went to great 
lengths to describe what Russia has done to bring about such 
a solution, and said that if he could just find someone with 
whom he could fashion an agreement -- someone who accepted 
that Chechnya will always be a part of Russia -- he would do 
so. 
 
-- Putin sharply criticized the EU\'s decision to cancel the 
GSP status that had been applied to its aluminum exports. 
This was particularly unjust given that Russia had recently 
signed the Kyoto protocol and extension of the PCA, both 
steps ardently sought by the EU. 
 
-- \"He spoke at length on seemingly irrelevant issues,\" added 
Viinanen.  The Finns had not intended to raise the issue of 
Karelia, but Putin did, saying that if the Finnish/Russian 
border, fixed at the end of World War II, were to be revised, 
then other borders in Eastern Europe could be challenged as 
well. 
 
6. (C) MFA Russia chief Perheentupa commented to us that 
disputes like Russia\'s GSP status will inevitably mark any 
trade relationship.  Still, he had a sense that \"Putin is in 
a state of mind where he can\'t decide what to do.  He goes 
from one summit to the next, just reacting to the outside 
world, not moving forward according to any strategy or 
vision.\" 
 
7. (C) Former PM Lipponen (who remains head of Finland\'s SDP) 
discussed the visit with Halonen and afterward assessed the 
meeting in a conversation with the Ambassador.  Lipponen said 
that the Russians feel under pressure on their perimeter, at 
least in the Baltic and Caucasus areas, and Halonen is 
concerned about what this might portend.  For his own part, 
Lipponen said, his advice to partners on both sides of the 
Atlantic would be to stand firm on principle, as always, but 
\"bear in mind that Putin feels very uncomfortable right now,\" 
especially with regard to Western involvement in the Caucasus. 
 
The up side: regional/bilateral issues 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Putin was for the most part upbeat and cooperative on 
the regional and bilateral issues Halonen felt most important 
to Finland: 
 
9. (C) Northern Dimension: Lipponen told the Ambassador that 
he was particularly pleased with the Halonen-Putin discussion 
of the EU\'s Northern Dimension (ND), toward which the former 
Finnish PM still feels a strong proprietary interest. 
Perheentupa described to us the challenges as the GoF sees 
them.  On the EU side, now that the ND is an official part of 
EU foreign policy all documents related to it are EU 
documents, which makes progress more cumbersome; moreover, 
practically speaking, Finland and Sweden are the only two EU 
nations still interested in the ND.  On the Russian side, 
Moscow has been reluctant to participate in the second action 
plan (which will expire in 2006, during the Finns\' EU 
presidency).  A third action plan seems unlikely; instead the 
Finns are casting about for a way to re-define the ND that 
engages more EU states and makes Russia (in Perheentupa\'s 
words) \"an almost equal partner.\" 
 
10. (C) We are told that Putin readily accepted the idea of 
restructuring.  Hearing that a mid-level Finnish delegation 
would be at the Russian foreign ministry on December 17 for 
further discussions, Putin said he would instruct MFA to be 
responsive.  He was as good as his word: the Finnish 
delegation was received at a higher level than expected and 
found the ministry quite willing to cooperate. 
 
11. (C) Saimaa Canal: This canal, which links the Saimaa lake 
district with the Gulf of Finland, was built a century ago, 
when Finland was a Russian Grand Duchy.  The post-World War 
II boundaries placed most of the canal within the USSR.  In 
1963, Finnish President Kekkonen negotiated a fifty-year 
agreement on Finland\'s use of the canal to continue maritime 
access to Finland\'s extensive navigable eastern lake 
district.  At the time, says Perheentupa, it was largely a 
political agreement, but the canal has since become quite 
important to Finnish forestry companies, who need to know 
whether the agreement will be renewed in 2013 so that they 
can plan for alternatives if necessary.  To date little 
negotiating progress has been made, with money being the core 
issue: \"We think we should pay according to real costs,\" said 
Perheentupa dryly.  \"The Russians think we should pay as much 
as we can afford.\"  Halonen raised this with Putin, who said 
that he would speak to the Ministry of Transportation.  The 
current goal is to give the Finnish and Russian Prime 
Ministers a progress report when they have their own next 
meeting, in May or June 2005. 
 
12. (C) Russia, Finland, and the EU: Russia\'s relations with 
the EU continue to crop up on the bilateral agenda.  The 
Russians have told the Finns repeatedly that they expected 
more sympathy and support from Finland within the EU than 
they have gotten.  In particular, Perheentupa said, Putin has 
the mistaken idea that Finland black-balled Moscow\'s proposal 
for visa-free travel between Russia and the Schengen area. 
In fact, we are told, the GoF supports gradual visa 
facilitation as a way to move toward eventual lifting of the 
visa requirement.  Finland does not object to that eventual 
goal, as long as the progress toward it is reciprocal. 
 
Looking forward to Finland\'s EU presidency 
------------------------------------------ 
 
13. (C) According to Perheentupa, Putin reiterated to Halonen 
what the Russians have said repeatedly in recent months: that 
Moscow attaches great hopes to the Finnish EU presidency. 
For their part, our interlocutors say, the Finns are no 
happier with Russians\' policies toward the EU than is Putin 
with the EU\'s policies toward Russia.  To address this, the 
Finns want to intensify the dialogue in preparation for July 
2006, and they expect to be able to do so: \"Finland is not a 
great power, like the UK, Germany, or France,\" commented 
Perheentupa, \"but we have long experience in dealing with 
Russia.\"

REF: TALLINN 1121 
 
Classified By: POL Chief John Hall for reasons 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
1. (C) On December 22 Jarmo Viinanen, advisor to Finnish 
President Halonen, gave us a read-out on the December 14 
meeting between Halonen and Russian President Putin. 
Viinanen confirmed that, as reported to Embassy Tallinn 
(reftel), Halonen had asked when Putin would sign border 
treaties with Estonia and Latvia.  Putin\'s response, 
according to Viinanen, was, \"When (their leaders) come here 
on May 9.\"  Putin added that this is his policy line -- there 
are others who do not feel this way. 
 
2. (C) We asked whether the Finns interpreted Putin\'s 
response as flippant.  No, said Viinanen, \"It\'s a promise in 
a way,\" and Putin may well have intended to send a message 
through Halonen: if Estonia and Latvia are willing to take 
the difficult political step of joining in the May 9 
ceremonies, Putin would be willing to respond in kind by 
signing the treaties.  The Finns believe that Putin\'s 
reference to this being his own policy line means that he 
will have to overrule those in the GoR who favor a more 
hard-line position.  \"I would suspect that there are those in 
MFA and elsewhere who would be happy to increase the 
pressure, not reconcile,\" Viinanen said. 
 
3. (C) Putin also noted that he had instructed FM Lavrov to 
discuss this with the Estonian and Latvian FMs in Brussels. 
The Finns do not know what came of those conversations. 
Viinanen did comment that even if Putin\'s offer is genuine, 
U.S. and EU pressure may be needed between now and May to 
make sure the Russian promise is kept. 
 
4. (C) Regarding the use of the word \"occupation,\" Viinanen\'s 
description of the Halonen-Putin conversation matches that 
given to Embassy Tallinn.  It is not clear to the Finns, 
however, whether Putin did intend to admit that an occupation 
took place, or whether this was some sort of rhetorical 
flourish intended to deflect the issue.  Putin may have 
wished to call into question the definition of \"occupation,\" 
or the legitimacy of its application in this instance.  In 
any case, said Viinanen, \"He didn\'t say flat out that it 
wasn\'t occupation.\" 
 
5. (U) Other aspects of the Halonen-Putin meeting are 
reported septel.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ASEC, PTER, FI, Counterterrorism 
SUBJECT: FINLAND:  2004 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 245841 
 
1.  (U)  This report is keyed to the applicable questions in 
reftel para 15.  The Embassy\'s summary update has also been 
emailed to John Kincannon and Kiersten McCutchan per reftel 
instructions. 
 
2.  (U)  a)  Finland actively supports and participates in 
the European Union\'s counterterrorism efforts, and in 2004 
participated in a number of EU and OSCE-sponsored events. 
 
b)  Finland is strongly committed to Afghan reconstruction 
and prevention of the resurgence of the Taliban.  Afghanistan 
is a major recipient of Finland\'s foreign assistance; Finland 
aims to disburse about 10 million Euros in development and 
humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan each year. 
Approximately 70 Finnish troops are currently deployed in 
Afghanistan in support of ongoing ISAF operations, and a 
number of Finnish civilian crisis management experts are 
working in Afghanistan as well.  Finland is a member, along 
with the UK and Norway, of a Provincial Reconstruction Team 
in Meymaneh in northern Afghanistan. 
 
Ten Finnish instructors are currently at the police academy 
in Amman training Iraqi police. 
 
In December 2004, Finland signed a bilateral Extradition and 
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the United States, 
bringing the Finnish-American relationship into conformity 
with the EU-U.S. Mutual Legal assistance Treaty executed in 
2003. 
 
c)  In January 2004, the Finnish Security Police dedicated a 
special unit to concentrate solely on fighting terrorism, the 
first of its kind in Finland.  Finland in 2004 pledged 1 
million Euros to help fund a UN Protection Force in Iraq. 
Finland has national authority to freeze terrorist assets. 
The Money Laundering Clearing House performs investigations 
on all individuals suspected of financing 
terrorist acts, including all individuals and entities on 
the UN 1267 sanctions committee\'s consolidated list. To date 
no Finns have been suspected of financing terrorism and no 
funds of foreign nationals suspected of terrorist financing 
have been located in Finland. In the event that funds are 
found, the assets could be frozen without undue delay for 
five business days. For the funds to remain frozen, a 
criminal investigation must be launched (either in Finland 
or abroad). The funds would remain frozen for the period of 
the investigation. 
 
e)  Finland has implemented regulations that allow it to 
freeze assets without EU or UN approval in cases when another 
government presents a legal request for action or when the 
individual or organization is suspected of having committed 
an offense within Finland\'s borders.  Finland has also 
amended its criminal code to make it possible to sentence 
leaders of terrorist groups to 15 years in jail, although the 
group has to have actually committed acts of terrorism in 
Finland before investigation or prosecution can begin.  If 
the charge also includes murder, the maximum sentence could 
be life imprisonment.  Finnish law enforcement has the 
authority to intercept wire, oral, and email communications 
with prior judicial approval in cases where national security 
interests are involved.  There is no special magistrate for 
counterterrorism, and the source for such judicial approval 
would depend upon the nature of the case. 
 
h)  Finnish Security Police in 2004 created a special unit 
concentrating solely on fighting terrorism.  Effective July 
1, 2004, the Parliament of Finland enacted legislation in 
support of the International Maritime Organization\'s 
amendment to the International Convention for the Safety of 
Life at Sea and the International Ship and Port facility 
Security Code.  Finnish authorities confirm that they are 
complying on schedule with the legislation\'s requirements, 
and that each of Finland\'s port facilities have submitted 
security plans that have been approved by the Finnish 
Maritime Administration. 
 
j)  Finland currently has about 70 troops inside Afghanistan 
in support of ongoing ISAF operations. 
 
l)  Finland supports the Global War on Terrorism.  However, 
some Finnish officials and most of the general public believe 
the likelihood of a terrorist attack inside Finland to be 
remote. 
 
o)  Finland has a relatively small Muslim community.  The 
Government of Finland monitors some individuals believed to 
have ties to terrorist organizations outside of the country. 
 
3.  (U)  Summary for Finland: 
 
Finland actively supports the Global War on Terrorism. 
Finland has implemented regulations that allow it to freeze 
assets without EU or UN approval in cases when another 
government presents a legal request for action or the 
individual or organization is suspected of having committed 
an offense within Finland\'s borders.  Finland has also 
amended its criminal code to make it possible to sentence 
leaders of terrorist groups to 15 years in jail, although the 
group has to have actually committed acts of terrorism in 
Finland before the investigation and prosecution can begin. 
If the charge also includes murder, the maximum sentence 
could be life imprisonment.  In January 2004, the Finnish 
Security Police also created a special unit concentrating 
solely on fighting terrorism, the first of its kind in 
Finland. 
 
Finland is committed to rebuilding Afghanistan and preventing 
the resurgence of the Taliban.  Approximately 70 Finnish 
troops are currently deployed in Afghanistan in support of 
ongoing ISAF operations, and a number of Finnish civilian 
crisis management experts are working inside Afghanistan as 
well.  Afghanistan is a major recipient of Finland\'s foreign 
aid, which includes support for the Afghan army and police 
force.  Finland aims to disburse approximately 10 million 
Euros in development and humanitarian assistance to 
Afghanistan each year. 
 
The Finns have ten instructors at the police training academy 
in Amman to help train Iraqi police personnel.  At the 2004 
Doha donors\' conference, Finland held one of the two chairs 
set aside for small donors.  Finland pledged 5 million Euros 
in development and humanitarian assistance to Iraq, and a 
further 1 million Euros to help funs a UN Protection Force 
inside Iraq. 
 
Finland is a party to all 12 international conventions and 
protocols relating to terrorism, and has implemented all 
applicable EU legislation against terrorism.

SUBJECT: FINNISH AID IN SUPPORT OF TSUNAMI RELIEF EFFORT 
 
REF: STATE 00959 
 
1. (SBU) The Government of Finland is about to increase its 
total disaster assistance donation to 12 million euros.  GoF 
donations have increased over the past week to keep slightly 
ahead of private donations.  End Summary 
 
2. (U) Embassy Helsinki made subject demarche immediately on 
the morning of January 4, 2005. 
 
3. (U) On December 27, 2004, the GoF made its first 
contribution of 500,000 euros through the Finnish Red Cross 
to the IFRC.  On December 29, as the scope of the disaster 
became better known, and private donations grew, the GoF 
added another 2 million euros: one million to the WFP, 
500,000 to UNICEF and 500,000 to the WHO.  On December 31, 
the GoF gave another two million euros to the IFRC, through 
the Finnish Red Cross.  All of the current 4.5 million euros 
have been disbursed. 
 
4. (U) The GoF has already set aside another 5.5 million 
euros in expectation of a UN aid request on Thursday, 
January 6.  Officials expect to allocate and disburse the 
amount as soon as the requests are in. 
 
5. (SBU) Although not yet announced, MFA sources tell us 
that the GoF will increase the current total of 10 million 
euros to 12 million euros by the end of the week. 
 
6. (U) Donations by the Finnish public stand at just below 
11 million euros as of the morning of January 4, 2005, with 
the amount constantly rising.  The bulk of this amount goes 
to the Finnish Red Cross (8.6 million) and Finnish Church 
Aid - the Lutheran Church\'s aid organization (1.1 million). 
Finnish UNICEF has received 750,000, Finnish Save the 
Children Fund 250,000, and two smaller organizations received 
another 120,000. 
 
7. (SBU) While sympathetic to the tsunami relief effort, 
MFA humanitarian assistance officials nervously watch as 
the aid figure grows to 12 million euros, now more than 
one quarter of Finland\'s total humanitarian assistance 
budget for 2005. 
 
8. (U) Statistical note: Although Finland is a relatively 
developed country, it is tiny.  Finnish GDP is less than 
1.5 percent of the U.S. GDP.
