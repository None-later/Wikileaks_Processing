E.O. 12356:DECL:  OADR 
TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, PHUM, PTER, LE, RAID 
SUBJECT:  LEBANESE AMBASSADOR FAWZI SALLOUKH CAUTIOUS 
ABOUT PROGRESS IN THE SYRIAN/LEBANESE TRACKS OF THE 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE TALKS 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY.  FAWZI SALLOUKH, LEBANESE AMBASSADOR TO THE 
EU AND BELGIUM, PAID A COURTESY CALL AUGUST 1 ON 
AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT.  SALLOUKH HAS BEEN IN BRUSSELS 
SINCE LAST APRIL AND HAS FOUND THE PACE LESS HECTIC THAN 
AT HIS LAST POST--WHICH WAS VIENNA--WHERE HE HAD TO 
COVER A BROADER RANGE OF ISSUES.  THE LESS HECTIC PACE 
ALSO APPEARS TO BE THE RESULT OF \"THIN\" EU-LEBANESE 
TIES, WHICH ARE UNLIKELY TO GROW STRONGER SO LONG AS 
LEBANON REMAINS OUTSIDE THE MULTILATERAL TALKS. 
SALLOUKH BLAMED TEL AVIV FOR THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE 
ISRAELI-LEBANESE BILATERALS, ASSERTING BEIRUT COULD 
DISARM HIZBALLAH ONCE THE ISRAELIS LEAVE SOUTHERN 
LEBANON.  END SUMMARY. 
--------------------------------------- 
SALLOUKH BELIEVES ASAD HAS TIME TO WAIT 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT ASKED ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR THE 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS GIVEN THE RECENT 
ISRAELI-JORDANIAN AGREEMENT.  SALLOUKH AGREED THAT 
DEVELOPMENTS WERE PROMISING AND WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AN 
EVENTUAL SETTLEMENT, BUT SAID SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD HAS 
THE ABILITY TO \"WAIT.\"  THE ISRAELI-JORDANIAN AND 
ISRAELI-PLO ACCORDS CONSTITUTE TWO \"POSITIVE STEPS 
FORWARD,\" BUT COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED THE \"FINAL 
SOLUTION\" TO THE PROBLEM.  HE ALSO WARNED AGAINST A 
STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH--SUCH AS FOLLOWED IN THE 
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CASE--TO SOLVING THE 
ISRAELI-SYRIAN/LEBANESE DIFFERENCES. 
 
4. ONCE THERE IS A RESOLUTION, HE SAW NORMALIZATION OF 
ISRAELI-SYRIAN AND ISRAELI-LEBANESE TIES AS HAVING THE 
POTENTIAL TO PROCEED MORE RAPIDLY THAN HAPPENED FOR 
EGYPT AND ISRAEL AFTER THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS.  HE SAID, 
THOUGH, THAT ISRAEL MIGHT BE \"AFRAID\" OF THE POTENTIAL 
FOR ISRAELI-LEBANESE ECONOMIC COMPETITION.  HE FELT, IN 
PARTICULAR, THAT LEBANESE AND ISRAELI AGRICULTURE WOULD 
BE COMPETITORS. 
 
5. SALLOUKH SAID LEBANESE PARTICIPATION IN THE 
MULTILATERALS DEPENDS ON PROGRESS IN THE BILATERALS, 
WHICH IN TURN IS PREDICATED ON THE \"UNCONDITIONAL 
WITHDRAWAL\" OF ISRAELI TROOPS FROM THE SOUTHERN SECURITY 
ZONE.  SALLOUKH SAID THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT THOUGHT ITS 
LEVERAGE IN THE BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE WEAKENED 
BY JOINING THE MULTILATERALS.  SALLOUKH, NEVERTHELESS, 
TRIES TO KEEP HIS GOVERNMENT ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN 
THE MULTILATERAL TRACK BY SENDING BACK REPORTS ON THEIR 
PROGRESS.  HE SAID THE EU WAS HELPFUL IN THIS REGARD BY 
GIVING HIM READOUTS OF THE VARIOUS MULTILATERAL 
MEETINGS. 
 
6. IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT\'S QUESTION, 
SALLOUKH WAS CONFIDENT THAT, IF ISRAEL WITHDRAWS, 
LEBANESE AUTHORITIES COULD REASSERT CONTROL OVER 
SOUTHERN LEBANON AND DISARM THE HIZBALLAH.  HE SAID 
LEBANON CANNOT DISARM HIZBALLAH NOW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE 
SEEN AS A \"TRAITOROUS\" ACT BY THE LOCAL POPULATION IN 
VIEW OF THE ISRAELI \"OCCUPATION.\"  ONCE THE ISRAELIS 
LEFT, SALLOUKH SAID SYRIAN TROOPS WOULD ALSO WITHDRAW. 
SALLOUKH REFERRED TO A RECENT STATEMENT BY THE 
GOVERNMENT WHICH AFFIRMED ITS INTENT TO DEPLOY 25,000 
TROOPS TO SOUTHERN LEBANON IF ISRAELI TROOPS WOULD 
LEAVE.  IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S CONDEMNATION OF 
THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN LONDON AND LATIN 
AMERICA, SALLOUKH UNDERLINED LEBANESE CONDEMNATION OF 
ALL \"KILLINGS,\" BUT SAID THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OR PROOF 
OF HIZBALLAH PARTICIPATION IN THE ATTACKS. 
 
7. AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT ASKED ABOUT SYRIA\'S INFLUENCE 
OVER THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.  SALLOUKH SAID SYRIA 
AND LEBANON WERE LIKE \"TWIN\" COUNTRIES.  THERE IS SO 
MUCH INTERMARRIAGE THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE.  THIS IS 
THE CASE, HE SAID, FOR BOTH CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM 
FAMILIES IN LEBANON AND SYRIA.  HE NOTED THEY WERE 
ADMINISTERED AS ONE UNIT DURING THE PERIOD OF OTTOMAN 
RULE. 
 
------------------------------- 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY STILL STALLED 
------------------------------- 
 
8. AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT ASKED ABOUT PRIME MINISTER 
HARIRI\'S HORIZON 2000 PLAN FOR DOUBLING PER CAPITA GDP 
IN TEN YEARS.  SALLOUKH SAID IT WAS GETTING A GOOD 
RECEPTION IN PARLIAMENT.  HE BEMOANED THE LACK OF 
AVAILABLE OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE.  HE SAID THAT ARAB SOURCES 
HAD DRIED UP.  THE MONIES, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT LEBANON HAD 
BEEN PROMISED AT THE TIME OF THE TAIF ACCORD HAD BEEN 
DIVERTED DUE TO THE GULF WAR.  HE HOPED THAT THE RECENT 
WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE OF USD 175 MILLION WOULD PROVE A 
CATALYST FOR OTHER DONORS, BUT ADMITTED LEBANON\'S 
REFUSAL TO JOIN THE MULTILATERALS WOULD PROBABLY 
CONTINUE TO BE A STUMBLING BLOCK TO MAJOR OUTSIDE 
ASSISTANCE. 
 
9. IN THE EVENT THAT LEBANON JOINS THE PEACE PROCESS AND 
INTERNATIONAL AID IS UNFROZEN, AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT 
ASKED ABOUT WHICH SECTORS COULD BENEFIT MOST FROM 
INVESTMENT.  SALLOUKH RESPONDED THAT LEBANON\'S 
AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY NEEDED ASSISTANCE THE MOST. 
LEBANESE AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD-HIT BY 
THE LACK OF OUTSIDE MARKETS.  SALLOUKH CITED THE EU, 
WHICH SLAPS A TWENTY-SEVEN-AND-HALF PERCENT TARIFF ON 
IMPORTED FRUITS FROM LEBANON.  HE WAS ALSO ADAMANT THAT 
MORE MONEY SHOULD NOT GO INTO THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR. 
GULF ARABS\' PURCHASES WERE DRIVING UP PRICES IN THE 
BEIRUT REAL ESTATE MARKET TO SUCH LEVELS THAT MOST 
LEBANESE COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY.  HE SAID PROPERTY 
PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN IN WEST EUROPEAN CITIES.  WHAT 
REMAINS OF LEBANON\'S MIDDLE CLASS SUFFERS FROM THE RISE 
IN PROPERTY PRICES, WHILE THE OVERALL ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS 
HAVE FED DISCONTENT IN BEIRUT\'S \"POVERTY BELT.\" 
 
10. SALLOUKH THOUGHT PROSPECTS WERE BRIGHT FOR THE 
TOURIST TRADE ONCE PEACE IS FULLY RESTORED.  LEBANON 
ENJOYED 250 KILOMETERS OF SEASHORE AND PLENTY OF 
HISTORICAL SITES TO INTEREST THE FOREIGN VISITOR. 
SALLOUKH SAID SOME OUTSIDE MONEY WAS BEGINNING TO FLOW 
IN TO REBUILD THE LUXURY RESORTS ALONG THE COAST. 
 
--------------------------------- 
EU-LEBANESE TIES ON THE THIN SIDE 
--------------------------------- 
 
11. AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT ASKED ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF 
EU-LEBANESE TIES.  SALLOUKH SAID HE TRIED TO INTEREST 
HIS GOVERNMENT IN UPGRADING THE 1977 TRADE AND 
COOPERATION ACCORD IN VIEW OF THE EU NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
OTHER MASHREK AND MAGHREB COUNTRIES.  HOWEVER, THE EU IS 
NOT INTERESTED UNTIL LEBANON JOINS THE MULTILATERAL 
PROCESS.  HE REITERATED THAT THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT 
WILL NOT JOIN THE MULTILATERAL UNTIL THERE IS PROGRESS 
IN THE BILATERALS.  THEREFORE, EU-LEBANESE TIES SUFFER 
FROM AN \"IMPASSE.\"  IN CLOSING, AMBASSADOR EIZENSTAT 
ASSURED HIM OF U.S. DETERMINATION TO ACHIEVE A LASTING 
PEACE IN THE REGION AND THE HOPE THAT U.S.-LEBANESE TIES 
CAN BE STRENGTHENED.

SUBJECT:  U.S.-EU TROIKA:  TERRORISM 
 
1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY WILLIAM R. REGAN, USEU.  REASON 1.5 
(B) AND (D). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (C)  THE MAY 7 U.S.-EU TROIKA DISCUSSIONS ON TERRORISM 
COVERED THE WATERFRONT, BUT SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS PAID TO 
THE EU\'S RELATIONS WITH IRAN, WHERE IT PLEDGED CONTINUED 
VIGILANCE, AND ITS COOPERATION PROGRAMS WITH THE 
PALESTINIANS (SEE PARAS 15-17 BELOW).  THERE WAS WIDE 
CONVERGENCE OF VIEWS ON TERRORIST TRENDS, THE RUSSIAN 
PROPOSAL FOR A NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION, AND THE INDIAN 
MOVE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE TREATY ON TERRORISM. 
 
3.  (U)  THE U.S. WAS REPRESENTED BY S/CT GORDON GRAY, 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPRESENTATIVE DREW ARENA, AND USEU 
POLOFF BILL REGAN.  VINCENT FEAN, JOINED BY RUPERT JOY AND 
KATE COLLINS, REPRESENTED THE UK PRESIDENCY.  ROUNDING OUT 
THE TROIKA WERE ROBERT ROLLINGER OF LUXEMBOURG AND PETER 
PRAMBERGER, MARINA CHRYSTOPH, PETER BLUMAUER, AND MS. HAMIDI 
OF AUSTRIA.  HENK VAN DER ZWAN REPRESENTED THE COUNCIL 
SECRETARIAT AND MICHEL IPAS AND HANS FEDDERSEN THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION. 
 
----------------- 
U.S.-EU STATEMENT 
----------------- 
 
4.  (C)  THE EU AGREED TO A JOINT STATEMENT ON SHARED 
OBJECTIVES AND CLOSE COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF 
COUNTERTERRORISM.  FEAN NOTED THAT EU VIEWED THE STATUS OF 
THE DOCUMENT AS A RESTRICTED WORKING PAPER, THUS NOT FOR 
PUBLIC RELEASE.  IN RESPONSE TO U.S. ARGUMENTS FOR MAKING 
OUR COOPERATION ON TERRORISM PUBLIC, FEAN SAID THAT THE EU 
TROIKA FAVORED A PUBLIC DOCUMENT AND PLEDGED TO WORK WITH 
THE U.S. TO ADDRESS THE ONE SENTENCE IN THE CURRENT PAPER 
WHICH THE EU WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE MADE PUBLIC.  FOLLOWING 
THE MEETING, FEAN, JOY, AND GRAY WORKED OUT BRIDGING 
LANGUAGE WHICH THE UK PROMISED TO CIRCULATE TO ITS EU 
PARTNERS. 
 
------------------------ 
TERRORISM TRENDS/THREATS 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  THE UK PRESENTATION NOTED A DECREASE IN TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS IN THE EU SINCE LAST FALL\'S TROIKA, PRIMARILY DUE 
TO A REDUCTION IN TENSIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  HOWEVER, 
THE THREAT OF INDIGENOUS VIOLENCE THERE AND IN SPAIN (ETA 
ATTACKS) AND FRANCE (MOSTLY CORSICA) REMAINS SIGNIFICANT. 
THERE HAD BEEN NO TERRORIST ATTACKS BY NON-EU GROUPS ON EU 
SOIL SINCE THE LAST TROIKA, BUT FUND-RAISING, PROPAGANDA, 
AND RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES BY EXTERNAL TERRORIST GROUPS 
CONTINUE.  LUXEMBOURG MENTIONED AN INCREASE IN COOPERATION 
BETWEEN TERRORISTS AND ORGANIZED CRIMINAL GROUPS. 
 
6.  (C)  THE UK PRESIDENCY MADE A SPECIAL PLEA ON BEHALF OF 
FRANCE FOR CLOSE COOPERATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION SHAING, 
IN LIGHT OF THE WORLD CUP SOCCER GAMES TO BE HELD IN FRANCE 
THIS JUNE.  FRANCE IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED BY THREATS FROM 
EXTREME LEFTIST/ANARCHIC GROUPS PROTESTING THE GAMES\' 
COMMERCIAL DIMENSION, ISLAMIC GROUPS, AND THOSE TARGETING 
PARTICULAR NATIONAL TEAMS OR INDIVIDUALS (PLAYERS OR HIGH- 
PROFILE FANS).  THE UK MADE A SIMILAR PLEA, ON BEHALF OF 
PORTUGAL, FOR INFORMATION ON THREATS TO THE EXPO 98 IN 
LISBON.  THE U.S., NOTING ON-GOING COOPERATION ON THESE 
EVENTS, UNDERTOOK TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND SHARE INFORMATION 
ON POTENTIAL THREATS WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF FRANCE AND 
PORTUGAL. 
 
7.  (C)  GRAY REVIEWED U.S. PERCEPTIONS OF TERRORIST TRENDS, 
NOTING AN OVERALL DECLINE IN ATTACKS BUT INCREASES IN THE 
LETHALITY OF ATTACKS AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  THE U.S. 
REMAINS TROUBLED BY INCREASED ATTACKS AGAINST CIVILIANS, THE 
RISE OF RELIGIOUSLY-MOTIVATED VIOLENCE, AND THE 
FRAGMENTATION OF TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
----------------- 
IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA 
----------------- 
 
8.  (C)  GRAY SURVEYED DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN SINCE KHATAMI\'S 
ELECTION, EMPHASIZING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DEMONSTRATED 
HIS INCLINATION TO CHANGE IRAN\'S FOREIGN POLICY BUT DOES NOT 
YET HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO COMPLETELY.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE 
U.S. OBSERVES CONTINUED IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, 
INCLUDING THE KAZAKSTAN INCIDENT IN FEBRUARY, THE 
ASSASSINATIONS OF DISSIDENTS ABROAD, THE FATWHA AGAINST 
RUSHDIE, AND SUPPORT FOR GROUPS VIOLENTLY OPPOSED TO THE 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS. 
 
9.  (C)  ALTHOUGH IRAN MAY NOT ALWAYS BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO 
EXTERNAL INFLUENCE ON THIS QUESTION, THE U.S. AND EU SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER TO PUSH TEHRAN IN THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION, SAID GRAY.  HE THEN URGED THE EU TO 
CONTINUE, IF NOT STRENGTHEN, ITS SYPHORE SYSTEM TO REVIEW 
VISA APPLICATIONS OF IRANIAN OFFICIALS; REVIEW THE SIZE OF 
MOIS STATIONS IN EU CAPITALS; INCLUDE TERRORISM IN THE EU\'S 
RENEWED DIALOGUE WITH IRAN; AND NOT BE SHY ABOUT CRITICIZING 
IRAN IF IT IS TIED TO NEW TERRORIST INCIDENTS. 
 
10.  (C)  FEAN RESPONDED THAT EU FOREIGN MINISTERS IN 
FEBRUARY HAD PLEDGED TO KEEP UP POST-MYKONOS VIGILANCE ON 
IRANIAN TERRORISM.  EU COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERTS PERFORMED AN 
ASSESSMENT OF THE TERRORIST THREAT UNDER THE NEW IRANIAN 
REGIME, AND HAD COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AS THE U.S.  THE 
SYPHORE SYSTEM WILL UNDERGO A TECHNICAL (NOT POLICY) REVIEW 
TO SEE HOW IT IS WORKING AND TO LOOK FOR AREAS OF 
IMPROVEMENT; THE REVIEW MAY BE COMPLETE BY THE END OF JUNE. 
FEAN EMPHASIZED THAT THE CONTROL OF MOIS STATIONS IS 
STRICTLY A MEMBER STATE MATTER, AND URGED US TO APPROACH 
CAPITALS ON THIS QUESTION.  TERRORISM WILL BE ON THE EU\'S 
AGENDA WITH IRAN WHEN TALKS BEGIN IN BRUSSELS ON MAY 19. 
FEAN STRESSED THAT OUR POINT ABOUT NOT BEING SHY DEPENDS IN 
LARGE PART ON U.S. WILLINGNESS TO SHARE, EVEN BILATERALLY, 
INFORMATION LINKING IRAN TO TERRORIST ATTACKS.  IN REPLY, 
GRAY NOTED THAT THE U.S. HA RECENTLY SHARED INFORMATION ON 
MOIS ACTIVITIES IN KAZAKHSTAN, AND UNDERSCORED THAT THE U.S. 
WOULD CONTINUE TO SHARE SUCH INFORMATION WITH EU MEMBER 
STATES IN THE FUTURE. 
 
11.  (C)  THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND 
EU THAT IRAQ AND LIBYA HAD NOT SPONSORED TERRORIST ATTACKS 
IN RECENT TIMES, BUT RETAINED THE CAPABILITY TO DO SO.  THE 
UK NOTED THAT THE EU HAS LONG HAD AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM FOR 
SCREENING IRAQI VISA APPLICANTS. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
DESIGNATION OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C)  GRAY REVIEWED THE U.S. DESIGNATIONS OF FOREIGN 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AND UPDATED THE EU ON THE RESULTS TO 
DATE AND THE LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE LEGISLATION AND THE 
DESIGNATIONS.  ARENA EDUCATED THE EU ABOUT THE HOW THE 
CHALLENGES WOULD WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE U.S. COURTS. 
THIS TOPIC DOMINATED THE SUBSEQUENT LUNCH DISCUSSION, 
PARTICULARLY AS THE UK IS CONTEMPLATING LEGISLATION TO 
CRIMINALIZE TERRORIST FUNDRAISING. 
 
-------------------------------- 
INTRA-EU COOPERATION AND EUROPOL 
-------------------------------- 
 
13.  (C)  ACCORDING TO THE UK, EU JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS 
MINISTERS LATER THIS MONTH WILL CONSIDER A STEPPED-UP 
PROGRAM OF INTRA-EU COOPERATION ON TERRORISM.  ONE ITEM WILL 
ENCOURAGE JOINT MEMBER STATE ACTION AGAINST IDENTIFIED 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE UK WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH OTHER 
MEMBER STATES AGAINST CREDIT-CARD FRAUD BY ISLAMIC GROUPS. 
THE AUSTRIANS NOTED THAT, AS A FOLLOW-ON TO THE NOVEMBER 
1997 SEMINAR IN LUXEMBOURG ON TERRORIST FINANCING, THEY 
INTEND TO HOST A SEMINAR IN VIENNA DURING 21-22 OCTOBER. 
GRAY THANKED THEM FOR THE INVITATION AND INDICATED THAT THE 
U.S. LIKELY WOULD ATTEND. 
 
14.  (C)  DURING ITS PRESIDENCY THE UK HAS HOSTED THREE 
EVENTS DESIGNED TO FOSTER CLOSER COOPERATION AMONG EU 
PARTNERS:  A TWO-WEEK SEMINAR ON BOMB-SCENE MANAGEMENT, A 
SEMINAR ON ARMS TRAFFICKING, AND THE FIRST-EVER SEMINAR ON 
CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM.  ARENA SEIZED ON THE 
SECOND ITEM TO EXPLAIN THAT THE BROADER DISPUTE SURROUNDING 
U.S. ARMS EXPORTS TO THE EU HAD A TERRORISM DIMENSION. 
 
15.  (C)  AS FOR EUROPOL, THE UK EXPLAINED THAT ALL BUT TWO 
MEMBER STATES HAD RATIFIED THE TREATY, AND IT IS HOPED THAT 
THOSE FINAL RATIFICATIONS WILL TAKE PLACE BY THE FALL.  THE 
TREATY STIPULATES THAT EUROPOL IS TO TAKE ON TERRORISM NO 
LATER THAN TWO YEARS AFTER IT BEGINS OPERATIONS, BUT SPAIN 
IS PROPOSING THAT IT BEGIN WORK IN THIS FIELD IN JANUARY 
1999.  THE EU JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS MINISTERS WILL 
CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL AT THEIR MAY MEETING.  AT ANY RATE, 
THE UK CONTINUED, EUROPOL WILL TAKE AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH 
TO THE PROBLEM FIRST WORKING TO SUPPORT MEMBER STATES, 
PERFRM DATA ANALYSIS, AND FACILITATE INFORMATION EXHANGES; 
SUBSEQUENTLY, IT WOULD DEVELOP RELATINS WITH THIRD- 
COUNTRIES. 
 
--------------------------------- 
COOPERATION WITH THE PALESTINIANS 
--------------------------------- 
 
16.  (C)  THE UK REVIEWED ITS THREE-YEAR PROGRAM OF 
COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION WITH THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
(PA).  HAVING JUST COMPLETED A REVIEW OF THE FIRST YEAR, THE 
UK SAID THE PROJECT IS OFF TO A \"DECENT START\" AND THAT 
COOPERATION WITH THE PA IS GOOD.  THE EU HAS SENT SIX FACT- 
FINDING MISSIONS FROM MEMBER-STATE SECURITY SERVICES TO THE 
REGION, INCLUDING ON MANAGEMENT, EXPLOSIVE DISPOSAL, SEARCH, 
INTERVIEW TECHNIQUES, AND SURVEILLANCE.  IN THE FUTURE THE 
EU HOPES TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND 
SECURE COMMUNICATIONS. 
 
17.  (C)  THE UK SAID LOCAL LIAISON BETWEEN NEILS ERICSON 
AND THE U.S. HAS IMPROVED SINCE LAST FALL, AND THE EU ASKED 
THAT THE U.S. TAKE BACK TO WASHINGTON THE UNION\'S STRONG 
DESIRE TO KEEP UP THIS LIAISON. 
 
18.  (C)  DURING UK PRIME MINISTER BLAIR\'S RECENT VISIT TO 
THE MIDDLE EAST, THE EU AND PA SIGNED AN AGREEMENT 
ESTABLISHING A SECURITY COMMITTEE.  THE COMMITTEE, WHICH 
MEETS FORTNIGHTLY AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS, DOES NOT DUPLICATE 
ERICSON\'S WORK, BUT DISCUSSES JOINT SECURITY EFFORTS, 
OBSTACLES TO BETTER COOPERATION, INFORMATION EXCHANGES, AND 
HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION.  ALTHOUGH NOT ADMITTED PUBLICLY, 
THE PA ACCEPTS PERIODIC EVALUATIONS OF ITS PERFORMANCE. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
DRAFT UN CONVENTION ON NUCLEAR TERRORISM 
---------------------------------------- 
 
19.  (C)  THE EU PRESIDENCY AND U.S. SHARED SIMILAR 
ASSESSMENT OF THIS RUSSIAN INITIATIVE (THE EU TROIKA MET 
LATER IN THE DAY WITH A RUSSIAN DELEGATION AND RAISED THIS 
ISSUE).  DESPITE EARLY SKEPTICISM, IT APPEARED THAT RUSSIA 
WAS WILLING TO WORK ON A VIABLE TREATY.  THE U.S. IS LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE JUNE 4-5 MOSCOW MEETING OF LEGAL EXPERTS OF 
THE EIGHT TO DISCUSS THE TEXT.  THE U.S. AND EU MEMBER 
STATES COORDINATED WELL DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST 
BOMBINGS, AND THE U.S. WOULD LIKE THAT COORDINATION TO 
CONTINUE. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS ON TERRORISM 
-------------------------------------- 
 
20.  (C)  AFTER DISTRIBUTING A SPREADSHEET SHOWING WHAT 
MEMBER-STATES HAD SIGNED AND RATIFIED WHAT CONVENTIONS, THE 
UK CONCLUDED THAT THERE WERE FEWER GAPS IN THE SHEET THAN 
BEFORE.  THE EU\'S TERRORISM WORKING GROUP, WHICH MET ON MAY 
6, MADE A MORAL (NOT LEGALLY BINDING) COMMITMENT TO HAVE 
MEMBER STATES IMPLEMENT LEGISLATION FOR THE TERRORIST 
BOMBING CONVENTION BY 2000.  GRAY NOTED THAT THE EIGHT HAS 
CALLED ON ALL STATES TO BECOME PARTY TO ALL ELEVEN 
CONVENTIONS BY THE YEAR 2000, AND THE U.S. HOPES THE EU CAN 
ADOPT THE SAME POLICY.  THE UK STRESSED THAT THESE ARE 
NATIONAL DECISIONS -- I.E., NOT MADE IN BRUSSELS.  MOREOVER, 
THE EU HAS BEEN ADVOCATING TO THE ACCESSION STATES OF 
CENTRAL EUROPE AND CYPRUS TO SIGN AND RATIFY ALL THE 
CONVENTIONS.  THE EU PROMISED TO PROVIDE A SIMILAR 
SPREADSHEET ON THESE COUNTRIES. 
 
------------------------------------- 
COMPREHENSIVE CONVENTION ON TERRORISM 
------------------------------------- 
 
21.  (C)  THE UK NOTED THAT IT WILL RAISE THIS INDIAN 
PROPOSAL WITH THE RUSSIANS LATTER THAT DAY.  THE EU HAS NO 
FORMAL POSITION ON THIS QUESTION, BUT IN 1996 THE TERRORISM 
WORKING GROUP DISCUSSED A SIMILAR IDEA AND CONCLUDED THAT IT 
WOULD BE UNHELPFUL AND DIVISIVE.  GRAY AGREED COMPLETELY, 
AND NOW THE TRICK IS TO DETERMINE HOW TO STAVE OFF OR SLOW 
DOWN THE INDIAN EFFORT. 
 
-------- 
OUTREACH 
-------- 
 
22.  (C)  THE UK EXPLAINED ITS OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO RUSSIA, 
THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN STATES, AND CYPRUS, DESCRIBING THEM AS 
FRUITFUL AND SUBSTANTIVE.  THERE IS SOME CONFUSION IN THESE 
COUNTRIES BETWEEN TERRORISM AND ORGANIZED CRIME SINCE THE 
LATTER OFTEN USES VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMER.  THE 
EU ALSO OUTLINED THE DISCUSSION OF TERRORISM IN ITS DIALOGUE 
WITH THE GCC AND IN THE EURO-MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERSHIP.  THE 
U.S. DESCRIBED ITS OUTREACH PROGRAM WITH THE OAS, 
EMPHASIZING THE USEFULNESS OF SUCH REGIONAL DIALOGUE BUT 
NOTING THAT THE BEST COOPERATION OFTEN OCCURS BILATERALLY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
TALEBAN, AUSTRIAN PRIORITIES, NEXT TROIKA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
23.  (C)  GRAY PRESSED THE EU FOR A RESPONSE TO A DEMARCHE 
IN MARCH ASKING THE EU TO RAISE TALEBAN SUPPORT FOR USAMA 
BIN LADEN IN ITS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TALEBAN.  THE EU DID 
NOT KNOW THE STATUS OF THE REQUEST, AND PLEDGED TO GET BACK 
TO US.  (COMMENT:  USEU IS STILL WAITING FOR A PROMISED 
REPLY TO REPEATED REQUESTS TO THIS DEMARCHE.  END COMMENT.) 
 
24.  (C)  THE AUSTRIANS SAID THEIR PRIORITIES WOULD BE THE 
SEMINAR ON TERRORIST FINANCING NOTED ABOVE, THE CONTINUATION 
OF WORKING GROUP BUSINESS, CONTINUATION OF PRACTICAL WORK 
WITH THE PALESTINIANS, AND WORKING ON THE NUCLEAR TERRORISM 
CONVENTION.  TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION IS OF GREAT 
IMPORTANCE TO AUSTRIA\'S PRESIDENCY, THEY CONCLUDED.  GRAY 
REQUESTED THAT WE BOTH REMAIN FOCUSED ON IRAN.  HE ALSO 
SUGGESTED THAT WE COULD DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM AND 
HUMAN RIGHTS. 
 
25.  (C)  AUSTRIA SET THE NEXT TERRORISM TROIKA FOR NOVEMBER 
25, THE DAY BEFORE THANKSGIVING.  GRAY AGREED, AND EXPRESSED 
HIS APPRECIATION FOR AUSTRIA\'S WILLINGNESS TO HOST A WORKING 
DINNER THE NIGHT BEFORE AND TO BEGIN THE NOVEMBER 25 MEETING 
EARLY ENOUGH TO ALLOW WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVES TO RETURN 
TO THE U.S. IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAY.

SUBJECT: EU-IRAN:  SOLANA\'S JANUARY TRIP TO TEHRAN 
 
REF: BRUSSELS 5536 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: USEU POLOFF LEE LITZENBERGER; REASON 1.5, (B,D) 

SOLANA TRIP TO IRAN:  KEEPING TEHRAN ON BOARD 
-------------------------- 
1.  (C)  EU FM\'S ON DECEMBER 9 INVITED EU HIGH REP SOLANA TO 
VISIT TEHRAN IN JANUARY TO DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF EU 
RELATIONS WITH IRAN.  ACCORDING TO BJORN LARRSON, SOLANA\'S 
IRAN/IRAQ POLICY ADVISOR (PROTECT), SOLANA WILL TRAVEL TO 
TEHRAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF JANUARY IN PART TO FOLLOW UP ON 
THE EU-3 INITIATIVE ON IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, AS REPORTED 
REFTEL.  LARSSON SAID THAT THE EU-3 COUNTRIES WERE AS EAGER 
TO PASS THE ISSUE ON TO SOLANA AS THE EU-12 WERE IN HAVING IT 
PASSED.  HAVING SOLANA FOLLOW UP IS ONLY LOGICAL, LARSSON 
SAID.  THE IRANIANS ALWAYS INTERPRETED THE EU-3 TRIP AS AND 
EU INITIATIVE.  ANOTHER REASON FOR SOLANA\'S TRIP, ACCORDING 
TO LARSSON, IS SIMPLY TO KEEP THE IRANIANS \"ENGAGED\" UNTIL 
THE NEXT IAEA REPORT IS ISSUED IN FEBRUARY.  LARSSON SAID 
THAT IAEA DG EL BARADEI HAS TOLD SOLANA THAT HE IS VERY KEEN 
FOR THE EU TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH IRAN. 
 
ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH TO RESUME TCA 
--------------------- 
2.  (C)  LARSSON SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE EU WELCOMED THE NEWS 
DECEMBER 12 THAT IRAN WILL SIGN THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL, THAT 
PROBABLY WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE EU TO RESUME TRADE 
AND COOPERATION AGREEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH TEHRAN.  \"SIGNING 
THE AGREEMENT IS ONE THING; IT\'S THE IMPLEMENTATION THAT 
COUNTS AND THAT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME,\" HE SAID. 
 
IRANIANS WANT TCA RESUMED 
---------------- 
3.  (C)  LARSSON SAID THAT IRAN REALLY WANTS THE TCA TALKS 
RESUMED -- THE DECISION BY EU FM\'S ON DECEMBER 8 NOT TO 
RESUME THESE TALKS WAS WHAT TRIGGERED TEHRAN TO CANCEL NEXT 
WEEK\'S UPCOMING COMPREHENSIVE DIALOGUE (REFTEL).  HE 
INDICATED THAT THE EU WOULD HOLD OUT ON RESCHEDULING THE TCA 
TALKS UNTIL IRAN DELIVERS SOMETHING MAJOR -- SUCH AS AGREEING 
TO PERMANENTLY END -- VICE SUSPEND -- ITS URANIUM ENRICHMENT 
PROGRAM.  HOWEVER, HE NOTED, THE EU HAS EXPLICITLY NOT SET 
ANY SPECIFIC BENCHMARKS FOR RESUMING THE TCA TALKS.  TO DO SO 
WOULD ONLY ENCOURAGE IRANIAN BARGAINING TO TRY TO STRIKE A 
BETTER DEAL. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
4.  (C)  CURRENTLY, IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS AT THE 
FOREFRONT OF EU-IRANIAN POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS, WITH FRANCE 
TAKING ONE OF THE TOUGHEST LINES AMONG EU MEMBERS.  WE ALSO 
NOTE THAT THERE ARE OTHER POLITICAL CONDITIONALITIES THAT THE 
EU HAS PLACED ON IRAN:  HUMAN RIGHTS, ANTI-TERRORISM AND
