SUBJECT: LABOR STRIKES IN ALEXANDRIA 
 
1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A GENERALLY CALM 
LABOR SCENE IN EGYPT, ALEXANDRIA SECURITY OFFICE HAS 
CORROBORATED AN OPPOSITION PRESS REPORT THAT A LABOR 
STRIKE HAD OCCURRED AT A FACTORY IN THE ALEXANDRIA SUBURB 
OF ABU KIR.  HOWEVER, THE SOURCE PROFESSED IGNORANCE 
CONCERNING THE OPPOSITION JOURNAL\'S ALLEGATION OF A 
SECOND WORK STOPPAGE IN THE ALEXANDRIA AREA, INVOLVING 
A DEFENSE PLANT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  BACKGROUND:  TRANQUIL LABOR SCENE.  SINCE THE FLARE- 
UP OF WORKER VIOLENCE AT THE DELTA TEXTILE MANUFACTURING 
CENTER OF KAFFAR AL-DAWWAR LAST SEPTEMBER, THE 
EGYPTIAN LABOR SCENE, TO ALL APPEARANCES, HAS BEEN 
GENERALLY CALM.  IN THE INTERVENING MONTHS, OUR TRADE 
UNION CONTACTS--ALWAYS RELUCTANT TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT 
OF LABOR UNREST--HAVE REPEATEDLY ASSURED US THAT ALL IS 
QUIET ON THE LABOR FRONT, PROTRAYING WORKERS\' RELATIONS 
WITH BOTH MANAGEMENT AND THE GOE AS HARMONIOUS.  REFLECT- 
ING THE PLACID LABOR SITUATION IS THE FACT THAT OF LATE, 
THE OPPOSITION PRESS HAS OMITTED ANY MENTION OF STRIKES 
OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT LABOR TROUBLE.  IN THE PAST, ONE 
OPPOSITION PAPER IN PARTICULAR, THE LEFTIST NATIONAL 
PROGRESSIVE UNIONIST GROUPING PARTY\'S (NPUG) WEEKLY, 
AL-AHALI, HAD OCCASIONALLY ALLEGED THIS OCCURRENCE OF 
STRIKES AND SIMILAR LABOR DIFFICULTIES.  AS FOR THE 
\"NATIONAL,\" PLO-GOE MEDIA, THEY AVOID DISCUSSION OF 
LABOR TROUBLE ALTOGETHER. 
- 
4.  STRIKES IN ALEXANDRIA AREA.  ON JUNE 19, HOWEVER, 
AL-AHALI BROKE ITS UNUSUAL SILENCE IN A BRIEF, PAGE-ONE 
STORY, WHERE IT REPORTED THAT NATIONAL SECURITY POLICE 
RECENTLY STORMED TWO FACTORIES IN THE ALEXANDRIA AREA TO 
BREAK UP MASS MEETINGS OF STRIKING WORKERS.  (COMMENT: 
THE PAPER GAVE NO SPECIFIC DATES FOR THE INCIDENTS. END 
COMMENT.)  ACCORDING TO THE PAPER, IN BOTH INCIDENTS, 
ONE INVOLVING THE ABU KIR ENGINEERING INDUSTRIES\' COMPANY 
AND THE OTHER THE \"MOHARREM BEY DEFENSE PLANT,\" POLICE 
EVICTED THE STRIKERS AND THEN CLOSED THE FACTORIES. 
AL-AHALI\'S ACCOUNT MADE NO REFERENCE TO ANY ARRESTS OR 
INJURIES RESULTING FROM THE POLICE INTERVENTION.  WORKERS 
STRUCK THE ABU KIR PLANT, SAID AL-AHALI, OVER MANAGEMENT\'S 
FAILURE, SINCE LAST JANUARY, TO PAY MONTHLY PRODUCTION 
BONUSES.  THE PAPER SAID NOTHING ABOUT WORKERS\' GRIEVANCES 
AT THE DEFENSE PLANT. 
 
5.  SECURITY OFFICIAL\'S CORROBORATION.  IN JUNE 24 MEETING 
WITH PSO, ALEXANDRIA SECURITY OFFICIAL CONFIRMED THE 
OCCURRENCE OF A STRIKE AT THE ABU KIR FACTORY OVER THE 
NON-PAYMENT OF WORKERS\' BONUSES.  THE OFFICIAL PROVIDED 
FEW DETAILS ON THE EVENT AND DOWNPLAYED ITS SIGNIFICANCE, 
PORTRAYING IT AS A RARE AND ISOLATED CASE OF WORKERS 
EXPRESSING THEIR UNHAPPINESS OVER A FACTORY-SPECIFIC, 
BREAD-AND-BUTTER ISSUE.  THE SOURCE APPEARED TO IMPLY 
THAT POLICE HAD INTERVENED TO HALT THE WORKERS\' PROTEST, 
BUT WOULD NOT CONFIRM WHETHER THE INCIDENT HAD RESULTED 
IN ANY ARRESTS OR INJURIES. 
 
6.  DEFENSE PLANT.  PERHAPS INDICATIVE OF EGYPTIANS\' 
SENSITIVITY AND SECRECY REGARDING THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY, 
THE SECURITY OFFICIAL DENIED HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE 
SECOND REPORTED INCIDENT, AT THE MOHARREM BEY FACTORY. 
WHEN PSO MENTIONED AL-AHALI\'S STORY, THE OFFICIAL REMARKED 
CALMLY \"I DON\'T KNOW WHAT YOU\'RE TALKING ABOUT\" AND THEN 
CHANGED THE SUBJECT. 
 
7.  COMMENT:  AT THIS JUNCTURE, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH 
CREDENCE TO GIVE TO AL-AHALI\'S REPORT OF LABOR TROUBLE AT 
THE MOHARREM BEY DEFENSE PLANT.  WHILE THE PAPER\'S 
REPORTING OFTEN LACKS OBJECTIVITY AND ACCURACY, LABOR 
TROUBLE IN SUCH MILITARY-RUN (BUT CIVILIAN-MANNED) 
FACTORIES IS NOT UNKNOWN; IN APRIL 1984, FOR EXAMPLE, 
VARIOUS SOURCES CONFIRMED THE OUTBREAK OF A STRIKE--BROKE 
UP BY POLICE--AT A DEFENSE PLANT NEAR CAIRO.  IN ADDITION 
TO THIS PRECEDENT, THE SECURITY OFFICIAL UNHESITATINGLY 
CONFIRMED AL-AHALI\'S REPORT OF THE OTHER STRIKE, AT THE 
ABU KIR SITE.  WE WILL PURSUE THE AL-AHALI STORY WITH OUR 
CONTACTS AND REPORT FURTHER AS WARRANTED.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  LETTER FROM ALEXANDRIA:  RAMADAN I 
 
1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THIS IS THE FIRST MESSAGE IN A TWO-PART 
SERIES WHICH DISCUSSES THE JUST-COMPLETED MONTH OF RAMADAN, 
AND THE ENSUING FEAST PERIOD, IN THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA. 
ALTHOUGH THE MONTH PASSED WITH THE TRADITIONAL GAIETY, THIS 
YEAR THE MUSLIM HOLY MONTH OF DAYTIME FASTING WAS CELE- 
BRATED AGAINST A BACKDROP OF APPARENT RISING FUNDAMEN- 
TALISM, CHALLENGES TO THE PUBLIC ORDER, AND THE CONTINUING 
SAGA OF THE \"TRIAL BY PRESS\" OF ALEXANDRIA\'S GOVERNOR. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  RAMADAN, WHICH LASTED FROM MAY 20 TO JUNE 17 IN EGYPT, 
WAS CELEBRATED IN TRADITIONAL FASHION IN ALEXANDRIA.  BUT 
THIS YEAR, UNLIKE LAST, IT WAS AGAINST A BACKDROP OF 
GROWING FUNDAMENTALISM AND SECURITY CONCERNS; WORSENING 
QUALITY OF LIFE, AND A DETERIORATING URBAN ENVIRONMENT; 
AND MORE THAN A WHIFF OF POLITICAL SCANDAL, DUE TO THE 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF GOVERNOR MA\'1\"\'S STEWARDSHIP OF 
THE CITY (FOR BACKGROUND ON LATTER, SEE ALEXANDRIA 435). 
FOR ALL THE GAIETIZ OF THE SEASON, ONE SENSED THAT SOME OF 
IT WAS PROBABLY FORCED:  MANY OF THE ALEXANDRIANS WE KNOW 
ARE WORRIED, BOTH ABOUT THEIR COUNTRY AND THEIR CITY. 
RAMADAN--WHEN THE ADVANCE GUARD ARRIVES OF THE 1.5 MILLION 
CAIRENES WHO EVENTUALLY SPEND THE SUMMER IN ALEXANDRIA-- 
TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD TIME TO REFLECT ON LIFE IN THIS 
CITY, AND TO COLLECT COMMENTS FROM OUR CONTACTS ABOUT 
ISSUES WHICH CONCERN THEM. 
- 
- 
4.  IFTARS:  \"IFTAR\" (OR, BREAKFAST), THE MEAL WHICH 
BREAKS THE FAST AT SUNSET, IS A TIME OF RESPLENDENT 
FEASTS IN ALEXANDRIA.  THE REPORTING OFFICER DID NOT 
ATTEND ANY AT WHICH THERE WAS LESS THAN FIVE TIMES THE 
AMOUNT OF FOOD NECESSARY FOR THE NUMBER OF GUESTS PRESENT. 
SOME OF THE FOODS ARE TRADITIONAL--FOR EXAMPLE, EGYPTIANS 
OF ALL CLASSES ACTUALLY BREAK THE FAST WITH \"FUL\" (RED 
BEANS)--INCLUDING IMPORTED ITEMS, SUCH AS THE APRICOT 
PASTE (FROM SYRIA)WHICH IS USED TO MAKE THE RAMADAN-ONLY 
DRINK, AMAR-EL-DINE.  THE PASTRY \"KUNAFA\" IS MADE ON 
TURNING GRILLS, PLACED OUTSIDE ON SIDEWALKS DURING RAMADAN, 
AND IS OFFERED AT EVERY IFTAR.  WHILE THE MEATS MAY VARY, 
SHRIMP IS NOT A TRADITIONAL RAMADAN FOOD AND PRICES IN 
ALEXANDRIA, KNOWN THROUGHOUT EGYPT FOR THIS DELICACY, 
ACTUALLY PLUMMET DURING THIS TIME.  (ONE HOTEL MANAGER 
OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE STOCKS UP,AND FREEZES, SHRIMP FOR THE 
ENTIRE SUMMER DURING RAMADAN.)  WHILE IFTARS IN ALEXANDRIA 
ARE MORE SOCIAL, THAN RELIGIOUS, OCCASIONS, THIS YEAR WE 
ATTENDED OUR FIRST HOME IFTAR WHICH HAD A SHAYKH PRESENT 
TO LEAD THE TWO EVENING PRAYERS ON PRAYER RUGS ESPECIALLY 
LAID OUT ON THE LAWN OF THE HOST\'S VILLA FOR THE OCCASION. 
COMMENT:  IT IS PROBABLY WORTH NOTING, IF ONLY IN PASSING, 
THAT NOT ALL OF THE VEILED WOMEN PRESENT, EITHER THIS YEAR, 
OR LAST YEAR AT SIMILAR FUNCTION, JOINED IN THE PRAYERS. 
IN ADDITION TO EXTREMELY HEAVY RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING 
DURING RAMADAN, EGYPTIAN TELEVISION ALSO RUNS SPECIAL 
VIEWER PARTICIPATION GAME SHOWS AND SERIALS IN THE EVENINGS. 
LARGE COLOR TELEVISIONS ARE EVEN BROUGHT OUT OF DOORS 
FOR GARDEN IFTARS.  BOTH YEARS, THE SERIAL WON OUT OVER 
THE LAST EVENING PRAYER FOR AT LEAST A FEW OF THE VEILED 
FEMALES.  END COMMENT. 
 
5.  IFTAR CONVERSATIONS: 
 
-- (A) VEILS:  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO SCIENTIFIC DATA, THERE 
WAS VISIBLY A SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF VEILED 
FEMALES IN ALEXANDRIA DURING THIS RAMADAN.  FEMALE, MUSLIM 
STAFF MEMBERS OF THE CONGEN (NONE OF WHOM IS VEILED) HAVE 
EVEN COME TO US TO EXPRESS CONCERN.  THIS ISSUE--PERHAPS 
CODE TO DISCUSS DEEPER WORRIES ABOUT THE RISE OF FUNDA- 
MENTALISM-- WAS DISCUSSED REPEATEDLY BY OUR CONTACTS 
DURING RAMADAN.  (COMMENT:  \"VEILS\", AS USED BY OUR 
CONTACTS, AND IN THIS MESSAGE, DESCRIBES THE CURRENT 
EGYPTIAN FASHION OF COVERED HEAD, HAIR AND THROAT--BUT 
WITH FACE STILL VISIBLE, UNLIKE IN THE GULF--ACCOMPANIED 
BY LONG SLEEVE BLOUSES AND FLOOR LENGTH SKIRTS.  END 
COMMENT.)  WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE (MODERATE) CHIEF JUSTICE 
OF EGYPT ADDRESSED THE BLUE-RIBBON EASTERN ALEXANDRIA 
ROTARY CLUB DURING ONE RAMADAN IFTAR.  THE SUBJECT OF 
VEILS APPARENTLY CAME UP DURING THE DISCUSSION, AND HE 
ASSERTED THAT THE KORAN DOES NOT CALL FOR VEILING.  HE 
WAS HEATEDLY DENOUNCED FROM THE FLOOR TO THE DEGREE THAT 
OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS ROTARY (COMPRISED MOSTLY OF THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESS LEADERSHIP OF ALEXANDRIA) FELT 
OBLIGED TO STAND UP AND DEMAND APOLOGIES FROM THEIR FELLOW 
ROTARIANS.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESSMEN IN 
EGYPT, MOHAMED RAGAB, IS A MEMBER OF THIS ROTARY.  HIS 
WIFE ADOPTED THE VEIL DURING RAMADAN--AND THAT HAS PRO- 
VOKED MUCH COMMENTARY AMONG THE CITY\'S ELITE (WHOSE WIVES 
ARE GENERALLY UNVEILED).  COMMENT:  IN A COUNTRY WHERE 
FELLAHIN WOMEN TRADITIONALLY COVER THEIR HAIR WITH A 
SCARF,  AND WHERE URBAN WIDOWS, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE 
POOR, OFTEN ADOPT HEAD COVERING, \"VEILS\" ARE NOT UNKNOWN. 
WE ARE TOLD, HOWEVER, THAT THEY ARE NOT TRADITIONAL AMONG 
EDUCATED, URBAN FEMALES.  SOME OF OUR CONTACTS HAVE 
ALSO EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN THAT SO MANY YOUNG WOMEN ARE 
ADOPTING VEILS.  THIS, IN FACT, IS WHERE THE SHARP RISE 
IN HEAD COVERINGS HAS OCCURRED.  BASED ON OUR TRAVELS IN 
THE DELTA, IT REMAINS AN URBAN PHENOMENON.  END COMMENT. 
 
-- (B)  GOVERNOR MA\'AZ\'S  PROBLEMS:  THE PARLIAMENTARY 
INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE (SEE ALEXANDRIA 435) FINISHED 
ITS WORK IN ALEXANDRIA DURING RAMADAN.  THE REPORT IS 
SLATED TO BE PUBLISHED IN EARLY JULY, BUT ALREADY THE 
PRESS IS REPORTING THAT THE COMMITTEE IS \"SPLIT\"--NOT 
ON HIS GUILT, BUT ON WHETHER TO REFER HIS CASE TO THE 
REGULAR COURTS OR THE SOCIALIST PROSECUTOR.  MEANWHILE, 
THE NDP MEMBER OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY WHO STARTED THE 
AFFAIR, GEBRIL MOHAMED, IS SEEN CARRYING SHEAVES OF 
PAPERS AROUND TOWN (PRESS REPORTS NOTE THAT HE HAS AN 
ADDITIONAL 39 CHARGES TO OFFER TO THE COMMITTEE) CLAIMING 
THIS CASE WILL BE \"THE EGYPTIAN WATERGATE.\"  EARLY DURING 
THE INVESTIGATION, THE ACCUSER SAID THAT HIS LIFE WAS 
IN DANGER (THE WINDSHIELD WAS MYSTERIOUSLY BROKEN ON HIS 
CAR, FOLLOWING WHICH HE HAS TAKEN TO PARKING IT OVERNIGHT 
ON THE GROUNDS OF THE NDP PARTY HEADQUARTERS)--CERTAINLY 
AN EXAGGERATION, BUT CALCULATED TO GARNER EVEN MORE 
PUBLICITY FOR HIS CAUSE.  THERE IS CONTINUED EXTENSIVE 
COVERAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION IN THE \"WAFD\" AND MOST 
OTHER NATIONAL PRINT MEDIA.  DURING RAMADAN, THE GOVERNOR 
GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO THE NEWS MAGAZINE \"OCTOBER\" CONCERNING 
HIS PERSONAL REAL ESTATE DEALS IN THE NEARBY BEACH RESORT 
OF AGAMI:  HE LIED, AND THE \"WAFD\" SUBSEQUENTLY PUBLISHED 
PHOTOCOPIES OF THE SALE AND TAX RECORDS.  ALTHOUGH 
PRESIDENT MUBARAK HAS NOT SPOKEN OUT PUBLICLY ON THIS 
ISSUE, GOVERNOR MA\'AZ WAS NOTABLY ABSENT FROM THE LIST 
OF GOVERNORS WHO RECEIVED AWARDS FROM THE PRESIDENT AT 
THE JUST-CONCLUDED CONFERENCE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN 
CAIRO.  WE HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT 
CAME TO ALEXANDRIA MAY 13 TO INAUGURATE VARIOUS PROJECTS, 
INCLUDING THE USAID TELEPHONE PROJECT, HE TOLD THE 
GOVERNOR ON ARRIVAL AT THE AIRPORT THAT \"IF WHAT THEY 
SAY ABOUT YOU IN THE PRESS IS TRUE, THE CASE WILL GO TO 
THE COURTS.\"  COMMENT:  WE CONTINUE TO BE INTRIGUED BY 
HOW THE PRESIDENT HANDLES THE CASES OF SENIOR GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS PUBLICLY ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION.  IN BOTH THE 
MOUSTAPHA EL SAID CASE, AND NOW APPARENTLY WITH GOVERNOR 
MA\'AZ, HE PERMITS A \"TRIAL BY PRESS\" AND THEN LETS THE 
COURTS TAKE OVER.  FOR LESSER LIGHTS (EG. THE RECENT 
NUMEROUS  FIRINGS AND FORCED RETIREMENTS IN THE CUSTOMS 
ADMINISTRATION (SEE FORTHCOMING SEPTEL), THE RECKONING 
DAY ARRIVES MORE SWIFTLY.  WE WONDER IF THIS OTHERWISE 
ADMIRABLE LOYALTY TO HIS SENIOR OFFICIALS--FOR EXAMPLE, 
NOT SUSPENDING THEM DURING THE PRESS ATTACKS--MIGHT 
BE MISPLACED?  END COMMENT.  AS ALEXANDRIANS ARE WELL-KNOWN 
FOR BEING (IF OUR READERS WILL PERMIT) ALEXANDRIA-CENTRIC, 
THIS ISSUE, ABOVE ALL OTHERS, DOMINATED RAMADAN CONVER- 
SATIONS HERE.  THE GOVERNOR HAS VERY FEW DEFENDERS AMONG 
THE ALEXANDRIA ELITE, WHOSE PRIME INTEREST NOW, APPEARS 
TO BE SPECULATING ON HOW THE GOVERNOR\'S RIGHT HAND MAN 
(AND WIDELY VIEWED AS CORRUPT, UNLIKE THE GOVERNOR), 
GOVERNORATE SECRETARY-GENERAL SHAKER ABDEL SALAAM, HAS 
MANAGED TO KEEP HIS NAME OUT OF THIS INVESTIGATION. 
 
-- (C)  NOT DISCUSSED:  WE WERE STRUCK BY THE LACK OF 
CONVERSATION ON THE FATE OF THE PERSONAL STATUS LAW, AS IT 
HAS APPARENTLY GALVANIZED CAIRO (SEE CAIRO 16094, PLUS 
NEWS REPORTS ON THE SAME SUBJECT).  IF THE SUBJECT WAS 
DISCUSSED, WE HAD TO RAISE IT.  WE DID--ON TWO OCCASIONS 
DURING RAMADAN.  ONE EGYPTIAN WOMAN (AND FORMER WIFE OF 
A SYRIAN VICE FOREIGN MINISTER) SAID THAT SHE HAD VISITED 
THE NDP ALEX HEADQUARTERS TO TRY TO GET \"SOMETHING\" 
STARTED AMONG THE WOMEN IN ALEXANDRIA, TO FORCE THE GOE TO 
DEVELOP LEGISLATION TO REPLACE THE \"JIHAN SADAT LAW\" 
STRUCK DOWN BY THE COURTS MAY 4.  SHE REPORTED THAT HER 
REMARKS WERE RECEIVED WITH HOSTILITY BY THE THREE FEMALE 
PARTY WORKERS WITH WHOM SHE SPOKE, WHO ASSERTED THAT THE 
JIHAN SADAT LAW WAS \"CONTRARY\" TO ISLAM.  OUR FRIEND, WHO 
RELATED THIS AT A TABLE WITH THREE WELL-EDUCATED FEMALE 
FAMILY MEMBERS PRESENT, SUMMARIZED HER VIEWS THUS: 
\"SYRIAN WOMEN WOULD NEVER PUT UP WITH THIS.  EGYPTIAN 
WOMEN ARE UNSOPHISTICATED.\"  (THE OTHERS PRESENT LET THE 
REMARK STAND.) 
 
-- ONE MEMBER OF THE SAME FAMILY DECIDED TO ASK FOR A 
DIVORCE IN MAY, WHEREUPON HER HUSBAND PROMPTLY ASKED 
HER TO LEAVE THE CAIRO APARTMENT WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED 
FOR THE YOUNG COUPLE BY THE GIRL\'S FAMILY.  THESE KINDS 
OF STORIES PROMPTED NDP ALEX PARTY CHIEF, MOHAMED 
ABDELLAH, IN A LATER CONVERSATION, TO TERM THE GOE\'S 
CURRENT EFFORTS TO PASS A PERSONAL STATUS LAW (SEE CAIRO 
16752) THE \"FLAT ACT.\"  THAT, HE ASSERTED, IS THE REAL 
ISSUE.  EGYPTIAN WOMEN ARE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT SECOND 
MARRIAGES OF THEIR HUSBANDS (RARE AMONG EDUCATED--AND 
POLITICIZED--EGYPTIANS, IN ANY EVENT), THAN IN SUDDENLY 
FINDING THEMSELVES HOMELESS IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE 
HOUSING CRISIS IS ACUTE, AND GROWING WORSE.  COMMENT: EVEN 
THE EXPECTED LARGE RETURN OF EGYPTIANS FROM THE GULF WILL 
AGGRAVATE THE HOUSING PROBLEM IN ALEXANDRIA:  MANY WOMEN, 
INCLUDING SOME ON THE CONSULATE STAFF, ARE RESIDING, 
WITH THEIR CHILDREN, IN THEIR PARENTS\' HOME DURING THEIR 
HUSBANDS\' LENGTHY ABSENCES IN THE GULF.  THESE PROFESSIONAL 
COUPLES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AVOID FACING THE HOUSING CRUNCH-- 
THUS FAR.  END COMMENT. 
 
6.  FASTING:  WE KNOW SEVERAL PROMINENT BUSINESSMEN IN 
ALEXANDRIA WHO HAVE STARTED FASTING ONLY IN THE PAST FEW 
YEARS.  EVERYONE WE KNOW, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, WHO NORMALLY 
IMBIBES ALCOHOL, GIVES IT UP FOR THE MONTH, AS WELL AS 
CIGARETTES DURING THE FASTING HOURS (THE LATTER IS PROBABLY 
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE HEAVY SMOKING EGYPTIANS).  THE GOE 
DECREE REGARDING THE SALE OF ALCOHOL DURING RAMADAN--IN 
GENERAL, IT IS ONLY SOLD IN \"TOURISTIC\" HOTELS OR 
RESTAURANTS, AND THEN ONLY TO FOREIGNERS--WAS SEVERELY 
ENFORCED IN ALEXANDRIA THIS YEAR.  THE GREEK CONSUL GENERAL 
INVITED A VISITING DELEGATION FROM GREECE TO DINE AT A 
LOCAL RESTAURANT, OWNED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE ALEXANDRIA 
GREEK COMMUNITY.  THE RESTAURANT HAS A RAMADAN ALCOHOL 
PERMIT.  DURING THE MEAL, A GENERAL INTELLIGENCE(MUKHABARAT) 
OFFICER CAME INTO THE RESTAURANT, OBSERVED THE WINE BEING 
SERVED TO THE GREEKS, AND ORDERED THE GREEK OWNER TO 
APPEAR AT MUKHABARAT HEADQUARTERS THE NEXT DAY.  DURING 
THEIR MEETING, THE RESTAURANT OWNER WAS TOLD THAT, EVEN 
WITH A PERMIT, IF HE SERVED ALCOHOL DURING RAMADAN, THE 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WOULD FIND \"OTHER\" WAYS TO PUT 
\"PRESSURE\" ON HIM.  THE RAMADA, CURRENTLY ALEXANDRIA\'S 
BEST HOTEL, VOLUNTARILY DID NOT SERVE ALCOHOL DURING 
RAMADAN, BUT HAD A SMALL BAR DISCREETLY SET UP IN AN 
UPSTAIRS SUITE FOR FOREIGNERS.  THE MANAGER TOLD US 
THAT, IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE, HE FELT HIS DECISION WAS 
\"GOOD FOR BUSINESS.\" 
 
7.  QUALITY OF LIFE--AND CIVIL DISTURBANCES:  THE CITY\'S 
GROWING PROBLEMS WITH PROVIDING SERVICES FOR ITS 3 
MILLION INHABITANTS BECOME AGGRAVATED DURING RAMADAN, 
DUE BOTH TO THE INFLUX OF VISITORS DURING THE FEAST 
FITLOWING RAMADAN, AND TO THE DEPLORABLE WORK HABITS OF 
FASTING CITY EMPLOYEES.  ELECTRICAL AND WATER OUTAGES 
WERE FREQUENT DURING RAMADAN, AND GARBAGE PICK-UP, A 
CONTINUING, MAJOR PROBLEM HERE, ALMOST STOPPED TOWARD 
THE END OF MONTH (AND THROUGHOUT THE SIX-DAY FEAST AT 
THE END OF RAMADAN).  THAT, COMBINED WITH HOT WEATHER AND 
BAD TEMPERS PRODUCED BY THE FASTING, PROBABLY LED TO THE 
NUMEROUS CIVIL DISTURBANCES, LARGE AND SMALL, THE CITY 
WITNESSED DURING THE MONTH.  AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS ARE 
FREQUENT, AS ARE STREET FIGHTS OVER THE SLIGHTEST SCRAPE: 
ONE CONGEN OFFICER REPORTED SEEING TWO STREET BRAWLS WITHIN 
ONE BLOCK.  THERE WERE ALSO SEVERAL MAJOR INCIDENTS BEFORE 
THE END OF THE MONTH, ATTRIBUTABLE TO \"RAMADAN CONDITIONS\" 
BY MOST ACCOUNTS: 
 
(A)  COPTIC-MUSLIM BRAWL:  DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE, 
THERE WAS A MAJOR FIGHT BETWEEN COPTS AND MUSLIMS AT A 
WHOLESALE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE MARKET IN THE NOUZA AREA 
OF ALEXANDRIA.  WE HAVE HAD TWO VERSIONS FROM POLICE 
SOURCES AS TO HOW IT STARTED:  ONE ALLEGES THAT A COPTIC 
MERCHANT OR CUSTOMER WAS MAKING A\"SHOW\" OF EATING AND 
SMOKING IN FRONT OF FASTING MUSLIMS.  ANOTHER VERSION 
SAYS THAT THERE WAS A SIMPLE DISPUTE, BUT WHEN THE TWO 
CONTENDERS REALIZED THAT ONE WAS COPTIC AND THE OTHER 
MUSLIM, A MELEE BEGAN, WITH BYSTANDERS JOINING IN.  OUR 
STATE SECURITY SOURCES CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE 15 
ARRESTS AND 4 HOSPITALIZED; TWO CARS WERE BURNED AND ONE 
HOUSE OR SHOP DESTROYED.  COMMENT:  AS COPTIC CONTACTS 
HAVE NOT APPROACHED US ON THIS INCIDENT, WE CONTINUE TO 
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT RELIGIOUSLY-INSPIRED AND SHOULD 
NOT BE VIEWED AS \"SECTARIAN STRIFE\"--BUT MERELY AN 
EXPLOSION OF TEMPERS AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS.  END COMMENT. 
- 
- 
(B)  MURDER IN LABAN:  THERE IS A TRADITION IN ALEXANDRIA 
OF FOOTBALL GAMES IN THE STREETS DURING RAMADAN, EVEN 
MAJOR THOROUGHFARES (MAKING TRAFFIC EVEN MORE OF A BLOOD 
SPORT), IN THE LAST HOUR BEFORE THE \"MEDFAA\"--THE CANNON 
WHICH IS FIRED TO SIGNAL THE END OF THE FASTING PERIOD. 
IN THE WORKING CLASS DISTRICT OF LABAN, MEMBER OF THE GOE\'S 
ELITE CENTRAL SECURITY FORCES, UNABLE TO GET A GAME STOPPED 
IN FRONT OF HIS ABODE, TOOK HIS GUN AND SHOT ONE OF THE 
PLAYERS.  WHEN THE YOUNG MAN DIDN\'T DIE IMMEDIATELY, HE 
SHOT HIM A SECOND TIME, WITH THE HORRIFIED FATHER STANDING 
BY, ACCORDING TO OUR POLICE SOURCES.  THE CSF MEMBER IS 
NOW IN PRISON, BUT TEMPERS ARE RAW IN LABAN. 
 
(C)  KNIFE FIGHT IN MANCHIA:  OUR INFORMATION IS SKETCHIER 
ON THIS INCPQENT, BUT IT APGEARS THAT ZEALOUS CUSTOMS 
POLICE, IN A VERY INFREQUENT APPLICATION OF LAW 119 
(1978)--WHICH ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE PROFITS ON IMPORTED 
ITEMS AMONG THE IMPORTER, WHOLESALER AND RETAILER--VISITED 
SHOPOWNERS TO LOOK AT THEIR BOOKS.  THE MANCHIA SHOPS 
WERE FULL OF IMPORTED ITEMS AS RAMADAN, WHEN SALES APPROACH 
THOSE AT CHRISTMASTIME IN THE U.S., IS THE TIME WHEN 
RETAILERS MAKE A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THEIR YEARLY 
PROFITS.  THE CUSTOMS POLICE DEPARTED, BUT WHEN THEY 
RETURNED THE SHOPOWNERS WERE WAITING FOR THEM WITH KNIVES. 
ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS KILLED, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE 
QUITE A FEW INJURED DURING THE ENSUING KNIFE FIGHT. 
 
COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH THESE THREE INCIDENTS SHOULD PROPERLY 
BE LABELLED \"CIVIL DISTURBANCES,\" ALEXANDRIA\'S SECURITY 
FORCES WERE ON A STATE OF ALERT (ALL LEAVES CANCELLED) 
THROUGHOUT THE FEAST WHICH FOLLOWS RAMADAN.  THE CITY 
EXPECTED VIOLENCE, OR AT LEAST PROHIBITED MARCHES, BY 
MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS DURING THE SIX-DAY BAIRAM HOLIDAY, 
PARTICULARLY THE FIRST MORNING.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE LEARNED 
OF NO VIOLENCE, THERE WERE, INDEED, FUNDAMENTALIST 
ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING SOME IN CONTRAVENTION OF GOE 
DECREES) AND THOSE WILL BE ADDED IN THE SECOND MESSAGE 
IN THIS SERIES.  END COMMENT.

IN MID-JUNE AT THE NEARBY ABU KIR ENGINEERING INDUSTRIES 
FACTORY, RESULTING IN AUTHORITIES\' CLOSING IT FOR TWO 
DAYS--JUNE 19-20.  THE OFFICIAL CONFIRMED THAT POLICE 
INTERVENED TO BREAK UP THE STRIKE, BUT LIKE THE SECURITY

OR INJURIES.  INTERESTINGLY, THE LATTER SOURCE INDICATED 
THAT CONTRARY TO OUR UNDERSTANDING, THE ABU KIR FACTORY 
IS RUN BY THE MILITARY, ALTHOUGH THE WORKERS ARE 
CIVILIAN.  WHILE DENYING THE OCCURRENCE OF A SECOND 
STRIKE, AT THE MOHARREM BEY DEFENSE PLANT, HE DID SAY 
THAT, AS PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, FOLLOWING THE ABU KIR 
INCIDENT, SECURITY POLICE WERE DEPLOYED AROUND THE 
MOHARREM BEY FACILITY. 
 
3.  IN ADDITION TO THE NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE UNIONIST 
GROUPING PARTY\'S WEEKLY, AL-AHALI, ANOTHER OPPOSITION 
JOURNAL, THE SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY\'S ASH-SHAAB, ALSO 
REPORTED ON ALEXANDRIA\'S LABOR TROUBLE.  ACCORDING TO 
ASH-SHAAB, IT WAS AT THE INSTRUCTION OF THE GOE\'S 
MINISTER OF STATE FOR MILITARY PRODUCTION, GAMAL IBRAHIM, 
THAT THE ABU KIR PLANT WAS CLOSED FOR TWO DAYS, IN 
REACTION TO THE STRIKE OVER NON-PAYMENT OF WORKERS\' 
BONUSES. 
- 
4.  WITH OUR SECURITY SOURCES REPORTING THAT ALL IS NOW 
BACK TO NORMAL AT THE ABU KIR FACTORY, THE OPPOSITION 
PRESS ALSO SEEMS TO CONSIDER THE MATTER CLOSED:  NEITHER 
ASH-SHAAB NOR AL-AHALI CONTAINED A FOLLOW-UP STORY ON 
THE INCIDENT IN THEIR LATEST EDITIONS, JUNE 25 AND 26, 
RESPECTIVELY. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  THE INCIDENT AT THE ABU KIR FACTORY SEEMS 
TO FIT THE PATTERN OF THE FEW LABOR STRIKES THAT OCCUR 
IN EGYPT:  A BRIEF FLARE-UP OF WORKER UNREST, CONFINED 
TO A SPECIFIC FACTORY, AND FOCUSED ON BREAD-AND-BUTTER 
ISSUES.  WHAT IS NOT TYPICAL ABOUT THIS STRIKE IS THAT 
IT APPARENTLY INVOLVED THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY, WHICH WOULD 
ACCOUNT FOR THE B BWPID RESPONSE BY THE AUTHORITIES--AT 
BOTH THE ABU KIR AND MOHARREM BEY SITES.  END COMMENT.

1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE BAIRAM FEAST, WHICH FOLLOWS RAMADAN, 
LASTED THREE DAYS IN EGYPT, FOLLOWED BY A WEEK-END.  EARLY 
NEGOTIATIONS, BETWEEN ALEXANDRIA SECURITY FORCES AND THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, MANAGED TO AVERT VIOLENCE ON THE 
FIRST DAY OF THE FEAST.  HOWEVER, THE LETTER, IF NOT THE 
SPIRIT, OF THE GOE BAN ON RELIGIOUS DEMONSTRATIONS WAS 
REPEATEDLY VIOLATED IN ALEXANDRIA, AND RIOT POLICE WERE 
DEPLOYED TO ENSURE ORDER.  MUSLIM BROTHER (AND MEMBER 
OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, REPRESENTING THE WAFD PARTY) 
MOHAMED EL MARAGHI WAS THE LEADING ACTOR IN THE FUNDA- 
MENTALIST EVENTS IN ALEXANDRIA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THE MONTH OF RAMADAN WAS AN UNEASY TIME IN ALEXANDRIA 
(SEE REFTEL), A CITY WHICH HAS A HISTORY OF FUNDAMENTALIST 
VIOLENCE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT WAS IN ALEXANDRIA THAT THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERS ATTEMPTED TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT 
NASSER IN 1954.  SHAYKH HAFEZ SALAAMA\'S CALL, IN CAIRO, 
FOR A \"GREEN\" MARCH IN SUPPORT OF THE RAPID IMPLEMEN- 
TATION OF SHARIA, OR KORANIC, LAW IN EGYPT (SEE CAIRO 
15351, 15780 AND 15793), AND THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR\'S 
SUBSEQUENT JUNE 12 DECREE BANNING PUBLIC MARCHES, 
UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE IN ALEXANDRIA: 
ALL LEAVES FOR SECURITY OFFICERS FOR THE DURATION OF THE 
FEAST AFTER RAMADAN WERE CANCELLED, AND POLICE WERE PUT 
ON ALERT STATUS.  WHILE THE MINISTER\'S DECREE, IN FACT, 
WAS VIOLATED IN ALEXANDRIA, INTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS 
BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTALISTS AND THE SECRET POLICE--AS 
WELL AS THE MASSIVE STREET PRESENCE OF RIOT POLICE ON 
THE FIRST DAY OF THE FEAST--MANAGED TO AVERT VIOLENCE. 
THIS IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH IT WILL BE FOREVER DIFFICULT 
FOR FOREIGNERS TO MAKE TOO MANY INQUIRIES IN EGYPT.  WHAT 
FOLLOWS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE EITHER TO OBSERVE, OR 
TO OBTAIN FROM SECURITY AND OTHER SOURCES.  OUR CONTACT 
WITH FUNDAMENTALIST CLERICS IN ALEXANDRIA REMAINS LIMITED. 
 
4.  PRAYERS IN THE STADIUM:  DURING PRESIDENT SADAT\'S TIME 
THERE WERE INAUGURATED,IN CAIRO AND IN ALEXANDRIA, 
MASSIVE MORNING PRAYER SESSIONS IN PUBLIC STADIA ON 
TBE FIRST DAY OF THE BAIRAM FEAST WHICH FOLLOWS RAMADAN. 
THIS YEAR IN ALEXANDRIA, STATE SECURITY AND THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERS, LED BY MOHAMED AL MARAGHI, UNDERTOOK EARLY 
DISCUSSIONS ON HOW THESE PRAYERS WOULD PROCEED.  STATE 
SECURITY FELT, PROBABLY, CORRECTLY, THAT THE OUTCOME OF 
THE EVENT WOULD BE DECIDED LARGELY BY THE TONE SET BY 
THE SHAYKH LEADING THE PRAYERS.  THEY PROPOSED THAT THE 
GOE MINISTRY OF THE AWQAF REPRESENTATIVE IN ALEXANDRIA 
(TECHNICALLY THE SENIOR IMAM IN THE CITY) LEAD THE 
PRAYERS.  THE MB\'S INSISTED ON SHAYKH MEHALAWI--A 
CHARISMATIC SHAYKH WHO BECAME A PARTICULAR TARGET OF 
PRESIDENT SADAT IN THE FORMER PRESIDENT\'S LAST MONTHS. 
(SHAYKH MEHALAWI WAS JAILED BY SADAT AND WE HAD HEARD 
NOTHING ELSE ABOUT HIM UNTIL HE CAME INTO THE CONSULATE 
GENERAL LAST YEAR, ESCORTED BY A BRIGADIER FROM STATE 
SECURITY, TO OBTAIN A VISA FOR TRAVEL TO THE U.S.  SEE 
84 ALEXANDRIA 329.)  THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR, 
ACCORDING TO OUR ALEXANDRIA SECURITY SOURCES, CONTINUED 
TO INSIST ON THE GOVERNMENT MAN.  THEREFORE, THE STADIUM 
PRAYER NEVER TOOK PLACE. 
 
5.  PRAYERS AT SIDI GABER:  SIDI GABER IS A PUBLIC SQUARE 
LOCATED ON AVENUE EL HORREYA, THE CITY\'S MAIN THOROUGH- 
FARE, IN THE CITY\'S AFFLUENT EASTERN SUBURBS.  THERE IS 
A SMALL MOSQUE LOCATED NEXT TO THE SUBURBAN TRAIN STATION 
ON THE SQUARE.  OUR STATE SECURITY CONTACTS TELL US THAT 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERS CHOSE THIS MOSQUE FOR THEIR MORNING 
PRAYERS JUNE 18.  OTHERS HAVE TOLD US THAT THIS IS THE 
TRADITIONAL PLACE FROM WHICH THE BAIRAM MARCH TO THE 
CITY STADIUM BEGINS, AND THAT THE SHAYKH AT THE NEARBY 
MOSQUE IS A MB (SHAYKH MEHALAWI TRADITIONALLY HOLDS 
FORTH AT THE IBRAHIM MOSQUE, WHICH IS LOCATED DOWNTOWN 
AT RAMLEH STATION).  WHATEVER THE REASON FOR THE SITE 
SELECTION--VICE ONE OF THE MAJOR MOSQUES DOWNTOWN-- 
SUNRISE ON THE FIRST DAY OF BAIRAM SAW APPROXIMATELY 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND FUNDAMENTALISTS GATHERED IN THE STREET, 
SURROUNDED BY AN ESTIMATED ONE THOUSAND POLICE IN FULL 
RIOT GEAR, COMPLETE WITH SHIELDS AND BATONS.  COMMENT: 
BOTH THOSE FIGURES COME FROM POLICE SOURCES.  AN 
EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN, AND CONGEN CONTACT, WHO HAPPENED 
TO BE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME, HOWEVER, TELLS US THAT 
THERE WERE \"AT LEAST\" THREE THOUSAND RIOT POLICE.  \"I 
BECAME VERY SCARED,\" HE SAID. END COMMENT.  TRAFFIC 
(WHICH IS LIGHT AT THAT EARLY HOUR) WAS TOTALLY BLOCKED, 
BUT THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE, ACCORDING TO BOTH WESTERN 
OBSERVERS AND STATE SECURITY SOURCES.  THE CONSULATE 
GENERAL\'S POLITICAL ASSISTANT (A MUSLIM) LIVES ON THE 
SQUARE, AND REPORTED BEING \"FRIGHTENED\" BY WHAT SHE 
OBSERVED, INCLUDING NUMEROUS WOMEN IN FULL VEIL--THE 
ENTIRE FACE COVERED (AS IN THE GULF).  SHE FURTHER 
REPORTED THAT THE PRAYER WAS EXTREMELY WELL-ORGANIZED, 
WITH LEADERS DRESSED IN DISTINGUISHING GARB.  IT 
APPEARS THAT THERE WERE INTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS AT THE 
SCENE, BETWEEN SECURITY OFFICIALS AND ORGANIZERS, AND 
THAT THOSE PARTICIPATING DID NOT ATTEMPT TO MARCH, BUT 
DISPERSED IN AN ORDERLY FASHION AFTER THE PRAYER AND 
SERMON.  SHE ALSO REPORTS THAT THE SERMON, BY MB MOHAMED 
EL MARAGHI, CONTAINED DENUNCIATIONS OF THE GOE, CALLED 
\"TYRANNICAL\" AT ONE POINT.  BY APPARENT AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN THE SECURITY FORCES AND THE FUNDAMENTALIST 
ORGANIZERS, THE CROWD WAS ENJOINED BY THE SPEAKER NOT 
TO RESPOND TO VARIOUS, REPEATED JIBES HE MADE AT THE 
GOVERNMENT.  REITERATING HER POINT ABOUT THEIR DISCIPLINE, 
OUR OBSERVER NOTED THAT THE GROUP OBEYED THIS REQUEST, 
ALBEIT WITH RELUCTANCE.  COMMENT:  MUSLIM BROTHER 
MOHAMED EL MARAGHI WAS ELECTED TO THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY 
(WAFD) IN THE HUY EHOIR ELECTIONS, REPRESENTING ALEXAN- 
DRIAACXDCENTRAL DISTRICT.  WE HAVEKMET WITHRWIM ONCE 
(SEE ALEX  QIIN PARA 21).  END COMMENT. 
 
6.  SMALLER MARCHES.  THERE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY SMALLER 
MARCHES, TRADITIONAL ON THE FIRST DAY OF BAIRAM, AT 
OTHER LOCATIONS (WE SUSPECT THAT THE SECURITY FORCES 
HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO PROHIBIT ONLY \"GREEN\" MARCHES)-- 
IN CONTRAVENTION OF MINISTER ROUCHDY\'S DECREE.  ONE 
OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE OFFICIAL RESIDENCE, AND 
INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED MEN (ONLY), MOST IN 
TYPICAL MB DRESS--WHITE GALLEBEYA, SKULL CAP--AND 
BEARDED, CHANTING THE TRADITIONAL BAIRAM PRAYER.  THE 
SECURITY FORCES STATIONED AT THE RESIDENCE DID NOT 
INTERFERE AS THE MEN MARCHED PAST IN A HIGHLY-DISCIPLINED, 
ALMOST MILITARY FASHION.  WE EARLIER REPORTED A DEMONSTRA- 
TION ON JUNE 17, THE LAST DAY OF RAMADAN, IN FRONT OF 
THE POLICE STATION IN THE WORKING CLASS DISTRICT OF 
MOHARREM BEY (SEE CAIRO 16037, PARA 8). THIFDMARCH, OF 
APPRTMIMALELY 300#$034 9, , WE HAVE SINCE LEARNED WAS 
NOT A \"GREEN\" 76-4:#, BUT A TACTIC USED TO FORCE EYEN 
GOVERNMENT TO PERMIT PUBLIC PRAYERS THE FIRST DAY OF 
BAIRAM.  WE HAVE HEARD OF SIMILAR DEMONSTRATIONS AT 
OTHER POLICE STATIONS AROUND THE CITY, FOR THE SAME 
PURPOSE. 
 
7.  POLICE-MUSLIM BROTHER \"COOPERATION:\"  AS WE BELIEVE 
IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE EVENTS IN ALEXANDRIA, THE 
SECURITY FORCES ARE IN DIALOGUE WITH MB LEADERS HERE: 
THE NEGOTIATIONS ATNSTATE SECURITY, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE 
CONDUCTED DIRECTLY BETWEEN GENERAL ABDEL HADI SAYED AND 
MOHAMED EL MARAGHI.  WE ALSO SURMISE THAT THE FORCES 
COUNTED ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL PROWESS, AND THE WELL-KNOWN 
DISCIPLINE, OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD TO HELP THEM KEEP 
ORDER.  WE NEVERTHELESS FIND THIS COOPERATION BETWEEN 
THE GOE AND A STILL-BANNED ORGANIZATION CURIOUS.  IN 
CONVERSATIONS ON THIS RATHER FINE POINT WITH EGYPTIAN 
CONTACTS WE HAVE HEARD TWO COMPLEMENTARY RATIONALES FOR 
THIS COOPERATION.  ALEX NDP PARTY CHIEF, MOHAMED ABDELLAH, 
IN COMMENTS REMINISCENT OF REMARKS ONE HEARS ABOUT THE 
CPUSA, INDICATED THAT THE MB MOVEMENT IN EGYPT IS 
THOROUGHLY PENETRATED, CONSISTS LARGELY OF OLDER 
FUNDAMENTALISTS AND IS NEITHER A DYNAMIC, NOR A 
DANGEROUS FORCE IN THE COUNTRY.  THE BUSINESSMAN QUOTED 
ABOVE (PARA 5), WHO HAS GOOD CONTACTS INSIDE THE SECURITY 
SERVICES, CLAIMS THAT THE MB\'S ARE \"QUIET\" NOW 
(RELATIVE TO PAST TIMES, ONE PRESUMES).  HE FURTHER 
REPORTS THAT IT IS IN GOE INTEREST TO KEEP THE ORGANI- 
ZATION BANNED, AS THAT ALLOWS THE SECURITY FORCES TO 
MAINTAIN CLOSE TABS ON THE MOVEMENT.  COMMENT:  WE HAVE 
HEARD RUMORS THAT THE BAN ON THE BROTHERHOOD MIGHT BE 
LIFTED--BUT ALSO WORRIES EXPRESSED THAT THAT WOULD 
SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL TO BOTH THE RADICAL MUSLIMS AND 
THE GENERAL POPULATION.  WE IMAGINE THAT THE SECURITY 
CONCERNS NOTED HERE MUST WEIGH HEAVILY IN GOE CALCULA- 
TIONS ON THIS ISSUE.  END COMMENT. 
 
8.  \"ISLAMIC GROUPS:\"  WHAT DOES CONCERN THESE SAME TWO 
SOURCES IS \"AL-GAMIAT AL-ISLAMIYYA\" (ISLAMIC GROUPS), 
THE SHADOWY, RADICAL UNDERGROUND GROUPS WHICH OPERATE 
ON A CELL SYSTEM, ACCORDING TO ABDELLAH.  ABDELLAH 
SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT KNOW WHO THEY ARE, OR 
WHO LEADS THEM.  THE BUSINESSMAN SAYS THAT IT IS THESE 
GROUPS WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PUT THEIR FEMALES INTO 
FULL-FACE VEILS, AS NOTED ABOVE.  HE ALSO CLAIMS THAT 
THE GROUPS ARE COMPOSED OF THE URBAN POOR, UNABLE TO 
COMPETE IN THE DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT OF CONTEMPORARY 
EGYPT. 
 
9.  COMMENT:  WE DO NOT WANT TO EXAGGERATE THE IMPORTANCE 
OF A GATHERING OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN A CITY OF 
THREE MILLION.  (THE ONLY MEDIA COVERAGE OF THIS EVENT 
WAS IN AN OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER, WHICH ALSO PUBLISHED TWO 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE GATHERING.  A COPY HAS BEEN POUCHED 
TO INR AND NEA/EGY).  NOR CAN WE EXPLAIN WHY SUCH A 
MASSIVE DEFIANCE OF MINISTRY ROUCHDY\'S DECREE OCCURRED 
ONLY IN ALEXANDRIA, NOT IN CAIRO (OR ELSEWHERE IN EGYPT, 
TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE).  WE SURMISE THAT, AT 
LEAST AS REGARDS ALEXANDRIA, THE SECURITY FORCES CAME 
TO BELIEVE THAT A CONTROLLED GATHERING--EVEN ONE WHICH 
COMPLETELY BLOCKED ALEXANDRIA\'S MAIN STREET--WAS 
PREFERABLE TO A POTENTIALLY VIOLENT, UNCONTROLLED EVENT, 
WHATEVER THE LEGAL TECHNICALITIES.  IN THIS REGARD, 
THE MB\'S BOTH SERVED GOE PURPOSES AND PROVIDED A VENUE 
FOR AL-GAMIAT AL-ISLAMIYYA--WHICH THEY WOULD HPXVE NEVER 
BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN THEMSELVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT. 
DESPITE THE EARLY HOUR OF THE SIDI GABER GATHERING, THE 
FACT OF ITS OCCURRENCE IS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE CITY, 
AND HAS PROVOKED WORRIED COMMENTS FROM SOME OF OUR 
CONTACTS--USUALLY ALONG THE LINES THAT, \"THE GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD CRACK-DOWN ON THESE PEOPLE.\"  WITHIN THE LIMITS OF 
RATHER SEVERE PERSONNEL CONSTRAINTS, WE SHALL ATTEMPT 
TO EXPAND OUR REPORTING ON FUNDAMENTALISM IN EGYPT\'S 
SECOND CITY.  END COMMENT.

2.  SUMMARY. THE JULY 2 PRESENTATION, TO THE PEOPLES 
ASSEMBLY, OF THE PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT 
ON ALEXANDRIA GOVERNOR FAWZI MA\'AZ\'S CONDUCT OF OFFICE 
DID NOT STOP THE DEBATE.  INDEED, NEW CHARGES AND 
COUNTER-CHARGES HAVE EMERGED DURING THE SUMMER 
WHICH INDICATE THAT THIS ISSUE IS FAR FROM DEAD. 
IN RESPONSE TO HIS TROUBLES, THE GOVERNOR HAD 
REMOVED TWO OF ALEXANDRIA\'S TOP POLITICAL OFFICIALS, 
LEAVING THE CITY WITH AN EMBATTLED GOVERNOR AND TWO 
NEWCOMERS TO COPE WITH ALEXANDRIA\'S MOUNTING PROBLEMS. 
HE HAS ALSO SUED WAFD PARTY AND NEWSPAPER LEADERSHIP 
FOR LIBEL.  WHILE THERE AREN\'T TOO MANY HEROES IN THIS 
STORY, THE EMERGING POLITICAL ROLE OF MINISTER OF 
AGRICULTURE, YOUSSEF WALLY, IS WORTH NOTING.  END 
SUMMARY. 
- 
- 
3.  POLITICS, THIS SUMMER, IN THE VERY POLITICAL 
CITY OF ALEXANDRIA, HAVE REVOLVED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY 
AROUND THE PROBLEMS OF   GOVERNOR FAWZI MA\'AZ 
(REFS A AND B).  WHILE THE GOE APPARENTLY ELECTED 
TO CUBBY-HOLE THE REPORT PRODUCED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY 
INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE (REF A), THIS WAS NOT ACHIEVED 
WITHOUT A SOMEWHAT TUMULTUOUS LAST DAY OF PARLIAMENT-- 
AND AT LEAST SOME DAMAGE, WE HEAR, TO THE REPUTATION 
OF PEOPLES ASSEMBLY SPEAKER, RIFAAT AL MAHGOUB. 
ALTHOUGH NO PUBLISHED ACCOUNT TELLS US WHAT HAPPENED 
TO THE REPORT (SOME BELIEVE IT WAS REFERRED TO THE 
MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT; OTHERS THINK THE REPORT, 
AND ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS, WENT TO THE 
SOCIALIST PROSECUTOR), THE GOVERNMENT IS PERCEIVED 
AS HAVING TAKEN NO ACTION IN THE MA\'AZ CASE, AND 
ATTACKS IN THE WEEKLY \"WAFD\" HAVE CONTINUED UNABATED. 
THE GOVERNOR HAS ENMESHED HIMSELF FURTHER BY GIVING 
INTERVIEWS WHICH, FAR FROM EXONERATING HIM, HAVE NOT 
ONLY KEPT THE DEBATE ALIVE, BUT PROVIDED NEW 
AMMUNITION FOR CHARGES AND COUNTER-CHARGES. 
 
-- NEAR THE END OF THE SUMMER, AND BECAUSE OF PERCEIVED 
WRONG ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE 
SEWAGE DEBATE HAS RESURFACED, BOTH IN ALEXANDRIA AND 
IN THE COLUMNS OF ALL NATIONAL DAILIES.  THIS PROUD 
CITY IS NOT ONLY BEING HELD UP TO NATIONAL RIDICULE, 
BUT THE APPARENT DRIFT AND INDECISIVENESS--ON BOTH THE 
MA\'AZ CASE AND THE SEWAGE OUTFALL QUESTION--HAVE LEFT 
BOTH OBSERVERS AND PARTICIPANTS WITH THE IMPRESSION 
OF \"A WEAK GOVERNMENT\"--IN THE WORDS OF ONE OF MA\'AZ\'S 
FELLOW GOVERNORS. 
 
4.  THE LAST DAY OF PARLIAMENT:  BY ALL ACCOUNT, THE 
LAST DAY OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, JULY 2, WAS A LIVELY 
OR \"MELODRAMATIC\" (IN THE WORDS OF \"AL SHAAB\" JULY 9) 
OCCASION.  THE 41-PAGE REPORT ON GOVERNOR MA\'AZ 
WAS DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBERS ONLY THAT MORNING.  TWO 
NDP AND TWO WAFD MEMBERS WERE ALLOWED BRIEFLY TO DISCUSS 
THE SANITIZED (ACCORDING TO THE \"WAFD,\" JULY 18) REPORT. 
THE LAST SESSION OF PARLIAMENT, HEAVILY MANAGED 
BY SPEAKER RIFAAT AL MAGHOUB, LASTED ONLY TWO HOURS 
AND 20 MINUTES AND SAW THE PASSAGE OF 6 NEW LAWS 
AND THE APPROVAL OF 14 REPORTS.  THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL 
ITEM WAS NOT EVEN ON THE AGENDA:  AT THE REQUEST GOVERNOR 
MA\'AZ, THE NDP MOVED TO LIFT THE PARLIAMENTARY 
IMMUNITY OF \"WAFD\" EDITOR, AND PA MEMBER FOR PORT SAID, 
MOUSTAPHA SHERDY.  IN ALEXANDRIA, WE UNDERSTAND 
THAT GOVERNOR MA\'AZ HOSTED AN INFORMAL RECEPTION 
IN HIS OFFICE THAT DAY TO CELEBRATE THE EVENTS 
THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN CAIRO.  COMMENT:  ANOTHER 
LOCAL ECHO OF CAIRO\'S DRAMATIC EVENTS WAS THAT 
MA\'AZ SENT HIS SECRETARY TO THE CONSULATE GENERAL 
THAT DAY TO PROCURE A VISA FOR HIS SON:  \"HE PROBABLY 
IS ASKING FOR THIS NOW, BECAUSE HE WON\'T BE AROUND 
MUCH LONGER,\" COMMENTED HIS SECRETARY.  END COMMENT. 
 
5.  LIFTING SHERDY\'S PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY:  BY 
MOST ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING NDP, THE SUCCESSFUL ACTION 
TO LIFT SHERDY\'S IMMUNITY (PROPOSED BY MA\'AZ DEFENDER 
FAROUK  GARANA, SEE PARA 7), WAS EXTRA-PARLIAMENTARY. 
IT PROVOKED A WAFD BOYCOTT OF PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S 
TRADITIONAL TEA ON THE LAST DAY OF PARLIAMENT, A 
ONE DAY RESIGNATION FROM THE WAFD LEADERSHIP BY 
FOUAD SERAG EL DIN, AND A FIRESTORM IN NATIONAL 
PRESS, MOST NOTABLY IN THE \"WAFD,\" WHICH INTER ALIA, 
CHALLENGED THE GOE TO SHOW ON TELEVISION THE 
COMPLETE FOOTAGE OF THE LAST DAY OF THE PEOPLES 
ASSEMBLY (A CHALLENGE NOT YET TAKEN UP).  AN 
UNREPENTANT SHERDY HELD FORTH IN A PAGE ONE EDITORIAL 
IN THE JULY 11 EDITION OF THE \"WAFD,\" DECRYING 
MAGHOUB\'S  MANAGEMENT OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY AND 
ATTACKING THE SPEAKER IN STRONG LANGUAGE:  \"THE DOG 
AT THE CENTER OF POWER... KNOWS HE IS NOTHING BUT 
A MERE CORPSE SITTING IN THE (SPEAKER\'S) CHAIR... WHOSE 
PEN DISCHARGES NOTHING BUT PUS.  I WOULD LIKE TO TELL 
HIM THAT MY FEELING TOWARDS HIM NOW IS THE FEELING OF 
PITY.\"  THE SAME EDITORIAL ALSO (AND FINALLY) GOT TO 
THE HEART OF WAFD CHARGES AGAINST MA\'AZ:  \"MA\'AZ SHOULD 
NOT SLIP AWAY FROM PUNISHMENT (BUT) MA\'AZ IS NOT 
THE ONLY PROBLEM.  THE BIG PROBLEM IS THE PROBLEM OF 
CORRUPTION IN EGYPT.  THE \'WAFD\' BELIEVES DEEPLY 
THAT THE CAMPAIGN WE ARE STARTING IN ALEXANDRIA 
SHOULD TEACH THE REST (OF THE COUNTRY) A GOOD LESSON.\" 
COUNTER-ATTACKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT, MOUSSA SABRY 
(AL AKHBAR, JULY 14)WROTE A PAEAN OF PRAISE FOR 
MA\'AZ, REMINDED HIS READERS THAT SHERDY LIVED 
\"IN THE GULF COUNTRIES FOR 12 YEARS,\" AND ACCUSED 
SHERDY OF THINKING THAT \"THE PEN IS A CLEAVER IN THE 
HAND OF A BUTCHER.\"  SABRY\'S EDITORIAL WAS ENTITLED 
\"CHAOS.\"  MA\'AZ AND ALEXANDRIA\'S LOCAL POPULAR 
COUNCIL PRESIDENT, EZZAT KADDOUS (REF A) SUBSEQUENTLY 
BROUGHT LIBEL SUITS AGAINST WAFD PARTY LEADER 
FOUAD SERAG EL DIN, AND THREE \"WAFD\" NEWSPAPER 
STAFFERS, SHERDY, BADAWI AND THE NEWSPAPER\'S 
CARTOONIST.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE.FIRST SITTING 
OF THE TRIAL WILL BE IN THE GIZA DISTRICT COURT 
OCTOBER 8.  BECAUSE SOME HARSH FEELINGS, REGARDING 
THE JULY 2 SESSION OF THE PA, REMAIN, MOST 
OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT THE GOE WILL WANT TO COMPLETE 
(OR OTHERWISE GET PAST) THIS LIBEL CASE BEFORE 
PARLIAMENT RECONVENES IN NOVEMBER. 
 
6.  MA\'AZ, \"ATTEMPTING TO SAVE HIMSELF\":  MA\'AZ 
SPENT THE REMAINDER OF THE MONTH OF JULY GIVING 
INTERVIEWS IN GOE-SPONSORED DAILIES AND MASS- 
CIRCULATION MAGAZINES ATTEMPTING TO EXCULPATE 
HIMSELF FROM THE CORRUPTION CHARGES:  THE THRUST 
OF THE ATTACKS AGAINST HIM HAD MOVED FROM POOR 
MANAGEMENT CHOICES REGARDING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 
(REF A) TO PROFITEERING ON LAND DEALS.  AFTER 
THREE TIMES, IN THE COURSE OF THESE INTERVIEWS, 
ATTEMPTING TO SHIFT BLAME TO A FORMER GOVERNOR 
FOR PROFITEERING ON BEDOUIN LAND IN THE BEACH 
RESORT AREA OF AGAMI, THE SON OF KAMAL EL DIB 
(GOVERNOR OF ALEXANDRIA UNDER NASSER AND SADAT) 
STRUCK BACK.  THE GOE-SPONSORED PRESS DECLINED 
TO PUBLISH HIS STATEMENT, BUT ON AUGUST 28, THE 
\"WAFD\" CARRIED A BANNER HEADLINE STORY, WHICH 
INCLUDED A PHOTOCOPY OF A DEED SIGNED BY MA\'AZ. 
COMMENT:  MOUFID EL DIB, THE SON OF THE FORMER 
GOVERNOR, TOLD US THAT HE IGNORED THE FIRST MA\'AZ 
CHARGE, BUT AS THE GOVERNOR EMBELLISHED THE STORY 
THROUGHOUT THE S, HE FELT THAT HIS DECEASED 
FATHER\'S HONOR, INDEED THAT OF THE WHOLE FAMILY, 
WAS AT STAKE.  HE ALSO TOLD US THAT THE GOE OFFICIAL 
IN CHARGE OF \"STATE\" (BEDOUIN) LAND IN AGAMI 
(THROUGH WHO MA\'AZ CONDUCTED HIS LAND DEALS) WAS 
RECENTLY REMOVED FROM HIS POST.  TO GIVE AN IDEA 
OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROFITEERING, EL DIB 
REPORTED THAT MA\'AZ (WHILE STILL A POLICE OFFICER) 
HAD PAID THE STATE 173 PIASTERS PER SQUARE METER 
FOR THE LAND, BUT THAT EL DIB--NOT HIS FATHER-- 
HAD BOUGHT IT FROM MA\'AZ AT LE 200 PER SQUARE 
METER.  END COMMENT.  WHILE SPEAKING PUBLICLY 
ABOUT THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM, MA\'AZ MOVED QUIETLY 
BEHIND THE SCENES TO RID HIMSELF OF TWO OF 
ALEXANDRIA\'S POLITICAL BARONS--MEN WHOM HE 
BELIEVED, ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS, HAD NOT 
SUPPORTED HIM SUFFICIENTLY IN HIS TIME OF NEED. 
IN SO DOING, HE HAS REMOVED FROM THE LOCAL SCENE 
TWO OF THE MOST DYNAMIC, WELL-KNOWN NATIONALLY, 
AND (BY MOST ACCOUNTS) EFFECTIVE, POLITICAL 
LEADERS IN ALEXANDRIA:  ALEXANDRIA$S SECRETARY 
GENERAL (NUMBER TWO PERSON IN THE GOVERNORATE 
AFTER MA\'AZ HIMSELF), SHAKER ABDEL SALAAM, AND 
LOCAL NDP PARTY HEAD, MOHAMED ABDELLAH. 
 
7.  NDP PARTY LEADERSHIP:  A SMALL PAGE ONE 
ANNOUNCEMENT, IN \"AL AHRAM\" AUGUST 12, INFORMED 
READERS THAT MAHMOUD DAOUD, HEAD OF EGYPT\'S 
COTTON BOARD AND MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE UNDER 
SADAT, HAD REPLACED MOHAMED ABDELLAH AS NDP 
PARTY CHIEF IN ALEXANDRIA.  WHILE THE BUSY ABDELLAH, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE PA FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, 
AND PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION LEADER FOR ALEXANDRIA, 
HAD FOUR TIMES ATTEMPTED TO SUBMIT HIS RESIGNATION 
FROM THE ALEX PARTY POST, HE WAS ACTUALLY FIRED 
BY SOBHI ABDEL HAKIM, SHURA COUNCIL SPEAKER AND 
SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE NDP.  AT (WE ARE TOLD) 
MA\'AZ\'S INSTIGATION, A TEN-PERSON DELEGATION 
COMPRISED OF PA AND SHURA COUNCIL MEMBERS FROM 
ALEXANDRIA, AND LED BY PA MEMBER (AND MA\'AZ ALLY) 
FAROUK GARANA, SOUGHT A MEETING WITH SOBHI TO 
COMPLAIN ABOUT ABDELLAH\'S NUMEROUS ABSENCES FROM 
ALEXANDRIA, AND PARTY DRIFT HERE.  MUCH OF THE 
SESSION HARKED BACK TO THE TUMULTUOUS MEETING AT 
NDP ALEX HEADQUARTERS IN APRIL (REF A).  ABDELLAH, 
IN TRUE ALEXANDRIAN FAS MANAGED TO HAVE 
SEVERAL SUPPORTERS INCLUDED IN THE DELEGATION--WHO 
SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN THE STEPS ABDELLAH HAD TAKEN SINCE 
THAT TIME TO HEAL PARTY WOUNDS, AND MA\'AZ\'S 
REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH ABDELLAH.  THE FACT OF 
ABDELLAH\'S FREQUENT ABSENCES FROM ALEXANDRIA, 
HOWEVER, COULD NOT BE DISPUTED, AS HE HAD JUST 
RETURNED FROM PA TRIPS TO BOTH THE PRC AND THE 
USSR (REF C).  ABDELLAH MAINTAINS HE WAS CONSULTED 
ON HIS OWN OUSTER AND WAS GIVEN THE COURTESY OF 
A PRIORI VETOES ON THREE POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS 
(NOTABLY, GARANA).  MOST ACCOUNTS HOLD THAT IT 
WAS ACTUALLY YOUSSEF WALLY, GOE MINISTER OF 
AGRICULTURE AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL OF 
THE NDP, WHO SUGGESTED DAOUD AS THE NEW PARTY 
LEADER FOR ALEXANDRIA--NOT ABDELLAH, AS ABDELLAH 
NOW TRIES TO CLAIM.  ACCORDING TO DAOUD, HIS 
COURTESY CALL ON NDP CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT MUBARAK, 
REVOLVED LESS AROUND ALEXANDRIA\'S MOUNTING PROBLEMS, 
THAN AROUND MUBARAK\'S HORTATORY (AND SOMEWHAT 
MISPLACED, GIVEN THE MOODS IN ALEXANDRIA) COMMENTS 
TO DAOUD TO BREATHE LIFE BACK INTO THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR IN ALEXANDRIA.  AT DINNER THE WEEK OF 
HIS SELECTION, THE SOMEWHAT ELDERLY DAOUD 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS HE FACES 
HERE, AND SAID HIS FIRST PRIORITY MUST BE TO HEAL 
THE WOUNDS IN THIS \"DEEPLY DIVIDED CITY.\" 
 
8.  THE SECRETARY GENERALSHIP:  THE FORMER 
CLOSENESS OF FAWZI MA\'AZ AND SHAKER ABDEL SALAAM 
(BOTH POLICE GENERALS) CANNOT BE EXAGGERATED. 
THEY APPEARED EVERYWHERE TOGETHER AND ALL THE 
CITY\'S PROBLEMS WERE ADDRESSED, IN A FASHION, BY 
MA\'AZ NAMING SHAKER TO HEAD A\"STUDY COMMITTEE.\" 
SHAKER EVEN GAINED NATIONAL PROMINENCE AS HEAD 
OF THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE FOR USAID\'S SUCCESSFUL 
NEIGHBORHOOD URBAN SERVICES (NUS) PROJECT IN THE 
THREE URBAN GOVERNORATES OF CAIRO, GIZA AND 
ALEXANDRIA.  SHAKER\'S DOOR AT THE GOVERNORATE 
WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO CALLERS, WHEREAS THE ALOOF 
MA\'AZ HOLDS ONLY TST PERFUNCTORY (AND 
GENERALLY NON-SUBSTANTIVE) COURTESY SESSIONS 
WITH VISITORS.  WE HAD EARLIER SPECULATED ON (WHAT 
WAS VIEWED LOCALLY AS) THE NEAR MIRACLE THAT 
SHAKER\'S NAME WAS NEVER ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF 
MA\'AZ IN THE NUMEROUS \"WAFD\" ARTICLES, ALTHOUGH 
SHAKER WAS PERCEIVED LOCALLY AS HEAVILY INVOLVED 
IN PRIVATE BUSINESS DEALS, WHEREAS MA\'AZ (UNTIL 
RECENTLY) WAS NOT.  WE ALSO RECEIVED INFORMATION 
FROM VARIOUS ALEXANDRIANS THAT SHAKER WAS QUIETLY 
BETRAYING THE GOVERNOR, IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE 
HIMSELF; THESE SAME SOURCES REPORTED THAT THEY 
HAD TOLD THE GOVERNOR THE SAME THING.  ALTHOUGH 
THE ACTUAL CAUSE FOR SHAKER\'S SUDDEN TRANSFER TO 
THE MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN CAIRO REMAINS 
UNKNOWN, IT IS CLEAR THAT HE WAS PUT OUT TO 
PASTURE BY MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AND 
ANOTHER FORMER POLICE GENERAL) ABU BASHA--AT THE 
REQUEST OF MA\'AZ.  ALLEGEDLY FURIOUS AT HIS 
TRANSFER TO THE NON-POSITION OF \"SPECIAL ASSISTANT 
TO THE MINISTER,\" SHAKER REPORTEDLY HAS RESIGNED 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  COMMENT:  MA\'AZ APPEARS DETERMINED 
TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES IN THE MIDST OF THIS 
TURMOIL:  IN A MEETING WITH VISITING USG 
OFFICIALS AUGUST 21, MA\'AZ POINTEDLY TOLD US 
THAT SHAKER HAD RECEIVED A \"BIG PROMOTION.\" 
THE SAME DAY, THE GOVERNOR LED THE DELEGATION 
TO THE FUNERAL IN ALEXANDRIA OF SHAKER\'S MOTHER. 
END COMMENT.  ACCORDING TO ABDELLAH, A DISHEARTENED, 
AND INCREASINGLY ISOLATED, MA\'AZ TOLD THE MINISTER 
TO \"NAME ANYONE\" TO REPLACE SHAKER--A HIGHLY 
UNUSUAL POSITION FOR ANY SENIOR MANAGER REGARDING 
THE SELECTION OF HIS DEPUTY.  BUT, THAT IS WHAT 
THE MINISTER DID:  FAYEZ OSMAN, FORMER HEAD OF THE 
EASTERN ALEXANDRIA DISTRICT, IS ALEXANDRIA\'S 
NEW SECRETARY GENERAL.  A FORMER ARMY OFFICER 
WHO LOST HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE 1956 WAR, THE 
CONGENIAL AND LOW-KEY OSMAN IS DUE FOR RETIREMENT 
IN A YEAR OR SO.  THIS LEAVES THIS TROUBLED CITY 
WITH AN EMBATTLED AND ISOLATED GOVERNOR, A 
CARETAKER SECRETARY-GENERAL--AND A POLITICALLY 
AWARE LOCAL POPULATION DRAWING UNFORTUNATE CONCLUSIONS 
ABOUT ITS CENTRAL NMENT. 
 
9.  \"MASSIVE\" POLICE TRANSFERS:  WHILE EVERYONE 
LOCALLY ASSOCIATES THE EARLY AUGUST TRANSFER OUT 
OF ALEXANDRIA OF 132  POLICE OFFICERS (\"THE 
LARGEST SHAKEUP IN POLICE ANNALS\" ACCORDING TO 
THE \"WAFD,\" AUGUST 22, AND CONFIRMED BY LOCAL 
SOURCES) WITH THE GOVERNOR\'S PROBLEMS, WE HAVE 
BEEN UNABLE TO ESTABLISH ANY DIRECT LINK--OTHER 
THAN THE OBVIOUS ONE THAT, AS A RESPECTED FORMER 
POLICE GENERAL, MA\'AZ MUST HAVE BEEN CONSULTED. 
HOWEVER, RUMORS ALSO ABOUND THAT HIS CLOSEST 
ALLIES IN THE POLICE FORCE WERE AMONG THOSE 
TRANSFERRED.  A GOVERNOR OF ANOTHER DELTA 
GOVERNORATE HAS EVEN MADE THE PRIVATE SUGGESTION 
THAT THE ACTIVIST MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR, AHMED 
ROUCHDY, WAS PREPARED TO TAKE ACTION ON \"THE 
MESS IN ALEXANDRIA,\" EVEN IF THE MINISTER OF LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT, ABU BASHA, WAS (OR COULD) NOT.  A 
FINAL TWIST TO THE SPECULATION IS THAT THE MOI 
WAS UNHAPPY WITH HOW THE SECURITY FORCES IN 
ALEXANDRIA WERE COPING WITH THE FUNDAMENTALISTS\' 
CHALLENGE HERE (SEE ALEX 546 AND 587).  COMMENT: 
WE EARLIER REPORTED ON THE REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE IN 
BEHAVIOR OF BOTH THE FUNDAMENTALISTS AND THE 
SECURITY FORCES AT THE RECENT KURBAN BAIRAM, AS 
COMPARED TO THE RAMADAN BAIRAM (ALEX  799). 
END COMMENT. 
 
10.  HOW MUCH LONGER WILL MA\'AZ REMAIN?  WHILE 
THERE ARE SOME LOCAL NOTABLES WHO CONTINUE TO 
DEFEND MA\'AZ (USUALLY HARKING BACK TO HIS 
ACKNOWLEDGED EXCELLENCE AS A POLICE GENERAL), 
THERE IS A GENERALIZED LOCAL SENTIMENT THAT HE 
MUST GO:  HE HAS BEEN TOO DEBASED BY THE MONTHS- 
LONG CAMPAIGN IN THE \"WAFD\" (ON WHICH THE GOE 
HAS BEEN PUBLICLY SILENT) AND PERCEIVED INACTION 
ON THE CITY\'S MOUNTING PROBLEMS (LED BY GARBAGE 
AND SEWAGE QUESTIONS), TO BE ABLE TO LEAD THIS 
RATHER RAMBUNCTIOUS CITY.  PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S 
POSITION ON THE MA\'AZ TROUBLES REMAINS SOMEWHAT 
OPAQUE:  WHILE WE HAVE HAD REPORTS (REF B) THAT 
HE INTENDS TO LET THE GO TO TRIAL, HIS 
REMARKS EARLIER THIS SUMMER TO THE AMBASSADOR 
TENDED TO INDICATE THAT HE CONTINUES TO HAVE 
CONFIDENCE IN MA\'AZ.  SINCE THAT TIME, HOWEVER, 
NEW CHARGES HAVE EMERGED (SUCH AS IN PARA 6), PLUS-- 
AND IMPORTANTLY-- THE PRESIDENT HAS SPENT THE 
SUMMER IN ALEXANDRIA.  WHILE HE HAS NOT BEEN 
SEEN SOCIALLY, MRS. MUBARAK HAS BEEN VISIBLE AT 
(AND KNOWN TO HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT) THE CITY\'S 
BEACHES, AND IN AGAMI.  AT THIS POINT, DECENCY 
WOULD SEEM TO REQUIRE THAT MA\'AZ BE PERMITTED HIS 
DAY IN COURT (PARA 4), BUT WE SUSPECT THAT HE WILL 
BE REMOVED BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, PROBABLY 
IN A CAMOUFLAGED TRANSFER OF SEVERAL GOVERNORS. 
IF HE IS NOT, THE GOE, AND SPECIFICALLY PRESIDENT 
MUBARAK, WILL FACE INCREASING CHARGES OF NEGLIGENCE 
OF EGYPT\'S SECOND CITY, AND LOUDER COMPLAINTS THAN 
WHAT WE ARE ALREADY HEARING THAT MA\'AZ IS BEING 
PROTECTED BECAUSE HE IS FROM MENOUFIA (REF A), 
AND HAS FAMILY TIES TO MUBARAK\'S PRIVATE SECRETARY, 
ZAKI. 
 
11.  A FEW (INTERIM) CONCLUSIONS: 
 
-- WHILE TEMPERS ARE RISING HERE, PARTICULARLY IN 
REGARD TO THE SEWAGE ISSUE, THE GOE HAS PROBABLY 
DISCOUNTED SOME OF THE GRIPES AS THEY COME FROM 
A CITY WHICH TRADITIONALLY IS ON DIFFICULT TERMS 
WITH THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE 
IMPRESSION OF WEAKNESS, OR NEGLIGENCE, OF THE 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT REMAINS.  AND, ALEXANDRIA\'S 
PROBLEMS--FOLLOWING THE ANNUAL SUMMER SOJOURN 
HERE OF THE POLITICAL AND JOURNALISTIC LEADERSHIP 
OF CAIRO--CAN NO LONGER BE CALLED \"LOCAL.\" 
INDEED, ALEXANDRIA AND ITS PROBLEMS, HAVE BEEN 
REPEATEDLY FEATURED IN THE COLUMNS THIS SUMMER 
OF ALL THE NATIONAL DAILIES AND HAVE APPEARED, AS 
WELL WE UNDERSTAND, IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
ARABIC LANGUAGE MEDIA. 
 
-- THE POLITICAL CHANGES WHICH HAVE OCCURRED 
HERE (PARAS 7-8), PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE 
GOVERNOR\'S PROBLEMS, HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE: 
APPARENT WEAK MEN HAVE REPLACED STRONG, NATIONAL 
FIGURES.  WHILE DAOUD HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE 
LEADER OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY, HE HAD A MIXED 
REPUTATION AS MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE.  LOCALLY, 
HE IS KNS INTELLIGENT, BUT A HEAVY DRINKER, 
AND SOMEONE POOR ENOUGH (UNLIKE ABDELLAH) TO BE 
TEMPTED BY PATRONAGE HE WILL NOW CONTROL. 
THE NEW SECRETARY GENERAL WILL LIKELY BE NON-CORRUPT, 
BUT NOT DYNAMIC ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE CITY\'S 
MOUNTING PROBLEMS, WHILE MA\'AZ CONCENTRATES ON 
HIS LEGAL DEFENSES. 
 
-- AS IS ITS WONT, THIS CITY HAS ALSO HAD AN 
IMPACT ON THE REPUTATION OF SEVERAL NATIONAL 
LEADERS.  DUE NOT ONLY TO HIS MANAGEMENT OF THE 
PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, BUT TO HIS PERSISTENT REPUTATION 
LOCALLY AS A NASSERIST, RIFAAT AL MAGHOUB IS 
VIEWED IN ALEXANDRIA AS ALMOST OUT OF THE RUNNING 
TO REPLACE KAMAL HASSAN ALI AS PRIME MINISTER. 
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOUSSEF WALLY, WHOSE ROLE 
IN KING-MAKING IS KNOWN (IN ADDITION TO SELECTING 
ABDELLAH\'S REPLACEMENT, WALLY IS ALLEGED PERSONALLY 
TO HAVE PICKED THE NEW GOVERNOR OF DAMIETTA, AS 
WELL AS SEVERAL OF THE MINISTERS IN MUBARAK\'S 
CURRENT CABINET) AND HE IS NOW VIEWED LOCALLY AS 
THE FRONT RUNNER AMONG THOSE LIKELY TO BECOME PM. 
ADDITIONALLY, WALLY IS GENUINELY POPULAR IN THE 
AGRICULTURAL DELTA.  FINALLY, AS HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, 
THE OTHERWISE POPULAR KAMAL HASSAN ALI, HAS NOT 
EARNED ANY KUDOS HERE THIS SUMMER--EITHER FOR HIS 
LACK OF ACTION ON THE MA\'AZ CASE, OR FOR HIS MIS- 
HANDLING OF THE CITY\'S SEWAGE PROBLEMS.  THAT TOPIC 
WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF A SEPTEL ABOUT THE TROUBLED 
SUMMER IN THIS CITY.

TAGS: PINR, EG 
SUBJECT:  MEETING WITH ALEXANDRIA\'S NEW GOVERNOR: FIRST 
IMPRESSIONS 
 
REF:  CAIRO 15935 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IT IS TOO EARLY TO ASSESS THE 
CHARACTER OF THE NEW MAN ON THE ALEXANDRIA HOT SEAT. 
INITIAL IMPRESSIONS OF GOVERNOR GAWSAQI ARE FAVORABLE, 
ALTHOUGH KEY CONTACTS FEEL HE HAS INSUFFICIENT GRIT 
AND EXPERIENCE FOR THIS VERY TOUGH JOB.  OTHERS CLAIM 
THAT AL GAWSAQI\'S ALLEGED \"SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP\" WITH 
MUBARAK WILL PAY THE GOVERNORATE MANY DIVIDENDS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  TWO WEEKS AGO, SAYYID ISMAIL AL-GAWSAQI WAS 
APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF ALEXANDRIA (REFTEL).  THE MOVE 
CAME AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE (HE IS RELATIVELY UNKNOWN), 
AND HE WAS NEVER EVEN MENTIONED AS BEING IN CONTENTION. 
SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN ALEXANDRIA, AL-GAWSAQI HAS STAYED 
BUSY MEETING WITH GOVERNORATE OFFICIALS AND LEADING 
BUSINESSMEN.  REQUESTS BY FOREIGNERS FOR MEETINGS WITH 
HIM WERE POLITELY, BUT FIRMLY, TURNED ASIDE, UNTIL 
JULY 24 WHEN THE LOCAL CONSULAR CORPS WAS FORMALLY 
INTRODUCED TO HIM. 
 
3.  (LOU)  THE AFFAIR, CEREMONIAL IN NATURE, HELD NO 
SUBSTANCE ALTHOUGH IT GAVE THE CONSULS AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO ASSESS THE GOVERNOR\'S FLUENCY IN ARABIC, FRENCH, 
AND ENGLISH (HE WAS APOLOGETIC ABOUT HIS ABILITY IN 
THE LATTER TWO BUT GETS ALONG VERY WELL IN BOTH).  HE 
SAID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS ABOUT FRIENDSHIP AND HIS 
DESIRE TO SOLVE MANY OF THE PROBLEMS AFFLICTING 
ALEXANDRIA. AT THE END OF THE MEETING, THOSE PRESENT 
SHOOK HANDS WITH THE GOVERNOR AS THEY FILED OUT OF HIS 
OFFICE.  I MANAGED TO PLACE MYSELF AT THE END OF THE 
LINE (HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS AMONG MY PROTOCOL CONSCIOUS 
COLLEAGUES) AND, AS A RESULT, WAS ABLE TO HAVE A FEW 
WORDS WITH HIM.  GAWSAQI SAID HE VERY MUCH WANTED TO 
HAVE GOOD COOPERATION WITH THE U.S.  HE SAID HE HAD 
NOT HAD TIME TO STUDY THE DETIALS OF OUR VARIOUS AID 
PROJECTS, BUT HE IS AWARE THAT OUR CONTRIBUTION TO 
ALEXANDRIA IS CONSIDERABLE.  HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY 
TO EMPHASIZE THAT HIS DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN TO US, AND 
I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS SINCERE. 
 
4.  (C)  FIRST IMPRESSION:  GAWSAQI COMES ACROSS AS A 
SINCERELY EARNEST, HONEST, AND WELL MEANING OFFICIAL. 
SEVERAL OF OUR CONTACTS, HOWEVER, HAVE EXPRESSED 
CONCERN THAT HE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE, GRIT, 
AND \"STREET SMARTS\" TO TACKLE ALEXANDRIA\'S VARIATED 
SECURITY, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  \"GOOD INTEN- 
TIONS DON\'T NECESSARILY MAKE A GOOD GOVERNOR,\" ONE 
KEY BUSINESSMAN REMINDED US. 
 
5.  (C)  OTHERS POINT OUT THAT GAWSAQI MAY PROVE TO BE 
A MORE EFFECTIVE GOVERNOR THAN MANY EXPECT.  THE REASON: 
HIS ALLEGED CLOSE RELATIONS WITH PRESIDENT MUBARAK. 
AS REPORTED REFTEL, GAWSAQI SERVED FOR A TIME IN THE 
EGYPTIAN AIR FORCE.  SEVERAL SOURCES TELL US THAT 
MUBARAK AND GAWSAQI WORKED TOGETHER IN THE EAF ON TWO 
OCCASIONS.  IN THE 1960\'S, DURING THE TENURE OF SIDQI 
MAHMUD AS AIR FORCE COMMANDER, HE   WAS ALLEGEDLY 
EAF LEGAL ADVISOR AND SHARED AN OFFICE WITH MUBARAK 
WHO WAS WORKING AS AN AIDE TO THE COMMANDER (COMMENT: 
THIS IS THE FIRST I HAVE HEARD THAT MUBARAK EVER HAD 
SUCH A JOB, AND OUR MEAGER BIO FILES FAIL TO SHED ANY 
FURTHER LIGHT.  PERHAPS INR/B CAN.  END COMMENT.) 
WHETHER OR NOT THIS STORY IS APOCRYPHAL, MUBARAK KNEW 
GAWSAQI AGAIN AFTER HE BECAME EAF COMMANDER IN THE 
MID-1970\'S AND WAS APPARENTLY VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS 
ABILITY. 
 
6.  (C)  ANOTHER STORY WHICH IS CIRCULATING ALSO 
UNDERSCORES  CLOSE LINKAGES BETWEEN THE TWO 
MEN:  A FEW YEARS AGO, THE PRESIDENT APPARENTLY WANTED 
TO APPOINT GAWSAQI ATTORNEY GENERAL, A KEY POST IN THE 
LEGAL SYSTEM HERE.  THE NOMINATION WAS THWARTED BY THE 
JUDGES REVIEWING THE NOMINATION BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY 
ENERAL MUST, ACCORDING TO EGYPTIAN LAW, BE DRAWN FROM 
HE COURT OF CASSATION (ONE OF THE TWO HIGHEST COURTS). 
AWSAQI WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF BENI 
UQAYF.  DURING A VISIT TO THIS GOVERNORATE, MUBARAK 
AS SUPPOSEDLY VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS FRIEND\'S 
DMINISTRATION, AND ON JULY 10 HE REWARDED HIM WITH 
LEXANDRIA. 
HAMBLEY 
 
7. (C)  ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INR CAN SHED ON 
GAWSAQI WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  NUMEROUS PHOTOS WERE 
TAKEN DURING THE JULY 24 CONSULAR CORPS PRESENTATION, 
AND WE WILL FORWARD ONE OF THE GOVERNOR AS SOON AS WE 
RECEIVE A COPY.  INR MAY ALSO WISH TO NOTE THAT GAWSAQI 
SERVED A SHORT TIME IN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND MAY 
HAVE HAD A BRIEF POSTING IN THE U.S.

E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR 
TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, PINS, PINR, EG 
SUBJECT: THE \"AL-AHRAR\" PARTY IN ALEXANDRIA: THE ISLAMIC RIGHT RESURGENT 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
- 
2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING 
PHENOMENA  WITHIN EGYPT\'S ESTABLISHED OPPOSITION PARTIES 
OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS HAS BEEN THE TRANSFORMATION 
WITHIN THE \"LIBERALS\" OR \"AL-AHRAR\" PARTY.   THROUGHOUT 
THE 1970\'S AND EARLY 1980\'S, THE PARTY WAS PROBABLY THE 
MOST BOURGEOIS AND PRO-WESTERN OF THE LEGAL OPPOSITION 
PARTIES (IT INITIALLY EVEN SUPPORTED CAMP DAVID, SUPPORT 
FOR WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN ABROGATED).  THE PARTY\'S WEEKLY 
NEWSPAPER WAS WIDELY READ IN ALEXANDRIA, ESPECIALLY PRIOR 
TO THE RE-PUBLICATION OF \"AL-WAFD\" NEWSPAPER WHICH NOW 
WINS LOCAL POPULARITY CONTESTS.   HOWEVER, SINCE THE 
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, THE PARTY HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY 
RADICALIZED BY A GROUP OF ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS WHO ARE 
EXPANDING THEIR DOMINANCE OF THE PARTY STRUCTURE. 
THE POST HAS RECENTLY ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH A MEMBER 
OF \"AL-AHRAR\'S\" POLITBURO WHO OPPOSES THE INCREASED 
ISLAMICIZATION AND WHO HAS DESCRIBED FOR US SOME OF 
THE RECENT CHANGES IN THE PARTY.  THIS SOURCE CONTINUES 
TO BELIEVE THAT RELIGION FOR MANY OF EGYPT\'S 
YOUNG PEOPLE IS ONLY A FAD, BUT SHE STILL COULD NOT 
CONCEAL HER CONCERN OVER WHAT HAS OCCURRED WITHIN 
THE \"AL-AHRAR\" PARTY. IT IS FAR TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE 
WHETHER THESE CHANGES WILL ALTER SIGNIFICANTLY THE 
MINUTE STANDING THE \"AL-AHRAR\" PARTY HAS ON EGYPT\'S 
POLITICAL MAP, ALTHOUGH ITS IMPACT HAS BEEN FELT IN 
ALEXANDRIA.  AT A MINIMUM, THE INFUSION OF DYNAMIC, 
YOUNGER BLOOD INTO AN ORGANIZATION WHICH HAD ALMOST 
CEASED TO EXIST POLITICALLY IS CERTAIN TO INVIGORATE 
THE LOCAL POLITICAL PROCESS IN 
FUTURE POPULAR COUNCIL ELECTIONS AND TO GIVE THE 
SQUABBLING AND DIVIDED LOCAL NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
- 
3.  TRADITIONALLY, THE \"AL-AHRAR\" PARTY (OR \"THE LIBERALS\") 
HAS ENJOYED ONLY A SMALL FOLLOWING IN ALEXANDRIA.  ITS 
MODERATELY LEFTIST, PRO-WESTERN POLICIES HAD 
CONSIDERABLE APPEAL TO BUSINESSMEN, SMALL MERCHANTS, 
AND THE MIDDLE CLASS GENERALLY, BUT THESE SAME ELEMENTS 
TENDED TO SUPPORT EITHER THE RULING NDP OR THE 
\"WAFD\". 
- 
4.  THE POST\'S ATTENTION TO RECENT CHANGES WITHIN 
\"AL-AHRAR\" DEVELOPED FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT 
SHAYKH SALAH ABU ISMAIL WAS PLANNING TO ADDRESS THE PARTY 
FAITHFUL IN ALEXANDRIA ON SEPTEMBER 11,  A DATE 
WHICH COINCIDED WITH THE PERES-MUBARAK SUMMIT. 
FOR SEVERAL YEARS, ABU ISMAIL HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MORE 
ARTICULATE (AND RADICAL) PROPONENTS OF THE ISLAMIC 
TENDENCY IN EGYPT.  ALTHOUGH HE HAS CONTINUALLY ESCHEWED 
VIOLENCE, HE HAS PROMOTED A VERY STRINGENT PROGRAM 
REGARDING ADOPTION OF THE \"SHARIA\" (ISLAMIC LAW) AND 
OTHER MEASURES DESIGNED TO MAKE EGYPT INTO SOME KIND 
OF ILL-DEFINED ISLAMIC STATE.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, ABU 
ISMAIL AND A LARGE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS JOINED THE 
\"AL-AHRAR\" PARTY.  ABU ISMAIL IS, IN EFFECT, THE 
DRIVING FORCE IN THE PARTY BEHIND THE CHAIRMAN, MUSTAFA 
KAMAL MURAD. 
- 
5.  CONGEN PERSONNEL RECENTLY CONTACTED MRS. RAGAA RASHAD, 
AN ALEXANDRIAN LAWYER AND MEMBER OF THE PARTY\'S POLITBURO 
(SHE ALSO HEADS THE LIBERALS \"WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS\" DEPARTMENT). 
RASHAD (PLEASE PROTECT) IS A STRONG OPPONENT OF THE 
RECENT CHANGES IN THE PARTY.  IN A RECENT CONVERSATION, 
SHE TALKED ABOUT ABU ISMAIL\'S SEPTEMBER 11 
CONVOCATION OF THE ALEXANDRIA BRANCH OF THE PARTY AND 
DESCRIBED THE IMPACT OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT\'S INROADS. 
- 
6.  CONERNING THE FORMER, RASHAD DECLINED TO 
GIVE TOO MANY DETAILS.  SHE NOTED THAT ABU ISMAIL HAD 
HIGHLIGHTED FOUR POINTS: (A) THE OPPOSITION 
BOYCOTT OF THE SHURA COUNCIL ELECTIONS THIS FALL; 
(B) THE IMPORTANCE OF THE APPLICATION OF THE \"SHARIA\"; 
(C) CONDEMNATION OF THE TORTURE OF \"ISLAMIC GAMAAT\" 
MEMBERS IN PRISON (NOTE: THIS IS A CONSTANT THEME IN 
THE OPPOSITION PRESS, AND ESPECIALLY IN \"AL-WAFD\", AS 
READERS OF THE CAIRO PRESS REVIEW WILL NOTE.); AND 
(D) \"AL-AHRAR\'S\" OPPOSITION TO THE EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI 
SUMMIT. 
- 
7.  ON THE RECENT CHANGES WITHIN THE \"AL-AHRAR\" PARTY, 
RASHAD ARGUED THAT MANY OF THE PARTY\'S KEY PRINCIPLES 
HAVE CHANGED SINCE SHAYKH ABU ISMAIL \"TOOK OVER.\" 
PREVIOUSLY, THE PARTY BELIEVED THAT THE \"SHARIA\" WAS 
ONE OF THE SOURCES FOR LEGISLATION.  NOW, THE PARTY 
HAS DETERMINED THAT \"SHARIA\" IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF 
LEGISLATION.  EVEN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY, MUSTAFA 
KAMAL MURAD, HAS SEEMED TO CHANGE.  RASHAD SAID THIS 
OCCURRED FOLLOWING A VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA.  MURAD (WHO WAS 
KNOWN IN ALEXANDRIA FOR HIS NIGHTLY BOUTS WITH JOHNNY 
WALKER) IS LETTING HIS BEARD GROW AND IS BECOMING VERY 
RELIGIOUS, ACCORDING TO RASHAD.  OTHER SOURCES TELL US 
HE HAS BECOME VERY MORIBUND IN HIS DIRECTION OF PARTY 
ACTIVITIES AND SEEMS TO HAVE ABDICATED MUCH OF HIS 
AUTHORITY TO ABU ISMAIL AND HIS SUPPORTERS. 
- 
8.  AS FOR THE NEW PARTY MEMBERS, MRS. RASHAD SAYS THAT 
THE PARTY NOW SEEMS TO CONSIST OF VARIOUS SECTS OF 
MUSLIM GROUPS.  EACH GROUP, SHE ADDED, HAS A DIFFERENT 
NAME, SUCH AS \"THE REJECTION OF THE FORBIDDEN AND THE 
REQUESTING OF FAIRNESS ASSOCIATION.\"  SHE CHARACTERIZED 
MOST OF THEM AS \"RADICALS\".  MOST OF THE MEMBERS, SHE 
SAID, ARE WELL-EDUCATED.  MANY ARE PROFESSIONALS SUCH 
AS DOCTORS, LAWYERS, AND PHARMACISTS.   MOST OF THE WOMEN 
ARE TOTALLY COVERED.  EVEN THOSE WHO ARE EDUCATED (AND 
MOST OF THEM ARE, ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE) SEEM TO BELIEVE 
THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE COVERED SO AS NOT TO ATTRACT 
MEN AND THEREBY \"COMMIT A SIN.\"  EXPANDING ON THIS LOGIC, 
SHE SAID THAT PROPONENTS OF THIS POLICY BELIEVE THAT IF 
THE WOMAN HAS PRETTY HANDS, THEN THE HANDS HAVE TO BE 
COVERED.  ATTRACTIVE EYES ALSO HAVE TO BE COVERED, EITHER 
BY WEARING GLASSES OR A VEIL.  EVEN PHOTOGRAPHS 
OF PEOPLE WHICH USED TO DECORATE PARTY OFFICES HAVE 
BEEN REMOVED BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED 
TABOO, ACCORDING TO RASHAD.  IN A RELATED INCIDENT, SHE 
REPORTED THAT ABU ISMAIL\'S DEPUTY, SHAYKH YUSIF AL-BADRI 
(AKA YOUSSEF EL BADRY) WAS ONCE INFURIATED BECAUSE 
\"AL-AHRAR\" NEWSPAPER HAD PICTURED \"NAKED WOMEN\" ON 
ONE OF ITS PAGES.  MRS. RASHAD DISCOVERED LATER THAT 
BY NAKED WOMEN, HE MEANT WOMEN WHOSE HAIR WAS NOT COVERED. 
MRS. RASHAD HAS, HERSELF, COME UNDER PRESSURE TO WEAR THE 
VEIL, BUT SHE HAS THUS FAR SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED. 
- 
9.  ASKED FOR HER VIEWS ON THE CURRENT APPEAL OF ISLAM 
TO EGYPT\'S YOUNG PEOPLE, RASHAD RECITED REASONS MENTIONED 
BY MANY IN THE COUNTRY\'S SECULAR POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT. 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PRESSURES ARE CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE RELIGIOUS REVIVAL, SHE SAID.  NEVERTHELESS, SHE 
QUESTIONED WHETHER THE ALL OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO WEAR 
BEARDS AND CLAIM TO BE RELIGIOUS ARE 
AS DEEPLY COMMITTED AS THEY STATE. 
SHE RECALLED THE STORY OF A RELATIVE WHO 
WAS A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE \"SUNNI\" (IN THIS CONTEXT, 
\"SUNNI\" MEANS RELIGIOUSLY DEVOUT BEARDED PEOPLE) GROUPS. 
HE  FELL IN LOVE WITH A GIRL WHO WAS NOT 
VEILED AND EVENTUALLY LEFT THE GROUP, SHAVED HIS BEARD, 
AND ADOPTED A DECIDEDLY SECULAR LIFE STYLE. 
- 
10.  BIO NOTE:  RAGAA RASHAD HAS LONG BEEN ACTIVE IN 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS.  IN THE LATTER CONTEXT, 
SHE HAS ADVOCATED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMITTEE IN 
ALEXANDRIA TO DEFEND WOMEN\'S RIGHTS.  SHE HAS PARTICIPATED 
IN A NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS CONFERENCES ABROAD AND, 
LOCALLY, HAS LECTURED TO THE MUSLIM YOUTH ASSOCIATION 
ABOUT CITIZENS\' RIGHTS.  A POLITICAL MODERATE, SHE IS 
A LAWYER AND CURRENTLY IN CHARGE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS IN 
ALEXANDRIA\'S GUMRUK DISTRICK.  TWO LOCAL ISSUES OF CURRENT 
INTEREST TO HER ARE SOLUTION OF THE CITY\'S ENORMOUS 
SEWERAGE PROBLEM THROUGH COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF DAY CARE NURSERIES TO HELP WORKING 
WOMEN PLACE THEIR CHILDREN DURING THE DAY.

2.  SUMMARY:  ISRAELI CONSUL GENERAL WAS PLEASED WITH 
RESULTS OF HIS AMBASSADOR\'S RECENT (AND, SURPRISINGLY, 
HIS FIRST) \"OFFICIAL\" VISIT TO ALEXANDRIA.  IN WAKE 
OF SEPTEMBER SUMMIT, INCREASED INTEREST IN TOURISM WAS 
EXPRESSED, BUT LOCAL ISRAELIS DO NOT EXPECT ANY 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.  ZIM LINES IS DOING ADEQUATE 
BUSINESS WITH ALEXANDRIA\'S PORT, DESPITE TRADE 
SLOWDOWN GENERALLY.  SMALL ISRAELI AGRICULTURAL 
ACTIVITY CONTINUES IN DELTA, RECENTLY EXPANDED BY

SASSON\'S \"OFFICIAL\" VISIT TO ALEXANDRIA: 
---------------------------------------- 
3.  AT AN OCTOBER 28 MEETING, ISRAELI CONGEN TUVAL 
AND I SHARED PERPSECTIVES ON RECENT VISITS BY OUR 
RESPECTIVE AMBASSADORS TO ALEXANDRIA.  AFTER 
DESCRIBING THE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES ENGAGED IN BY 
AMBASSADOR AND MRS. WISNER AND THE ENTHUSIASTIC 
RECEPTION THEY RECEIVED, I ASKED TUVAL HOW SASSON\'S 
OWN OCTOBER 16 VISIT HAD GONE. 
 
4.  TO MY ASTONISHMENT, TUVAL SAID THIS WAS SASSON\'S 
FIRST \"OFFICIAL\" VISIT TO ALEXANDRIA IN THE OVER 
FIVE YEARS HE HAS BEEN ISRAEL\'S AMBASSADOR TO CAIRO. 
HE SAID SASSON HAD VISITED THE CITY IN CONNECTION 
WITH BILATERAL MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 
FOREIGN MINISTER, OR TO ACCOMPANY DELEGATIONS. 
HOWEVER, HE HAD NEVER CALLED ON THE GOVERNOR OR MET 
WITH ALEXANDRIAN PERSONALITIES.  IN ANY EVENT, BOTH 
HE AND SASSON WERE PLEASED WITH THE VISIT. 
 
5.  TUVAL SAID THE MEETING WITH GOVERNOR GAWSAQI 
HAD GONE WELL.  I PROBED HIM A LITTLE ON THIS 
POINT, AND HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS FRIENDLY, 
EVINCED SUPPORT FOR GOOD EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI RELATIONS, 
AND BASICALLY RESPONDED \"INSHALLAH\" (GOD WILLING) TO 
THE ISRAELIS\' EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST IN EXPANDED 
TRADE AND TOURISM.  AT A BUFFET LUNCH, TUVAL 
INTRODUCED HIS AMBASSADOR TO OVER 40 LOCAL BUSINESSMEN, 
TRAVEL AGENTS, ACADEMICS, AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
IN CUSTOMS AND THE JUDICIARY WITH WHOM HE HAS HAD 
OFFICIAL DEALINGS.  HE SAID HE WAS PLEASED BY BOTH 
THE TURNOUT AND THE ENSUING  DISCUSSIONS.  NOTING 
THAT HE HAS DIFFERED FREQUENTLY IN THE PAST WITH 
SASSON\'S OFTEN DOUR DEPICTION OF EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI 
RELATIONS, TUVAL SAID HIS AMBASSADOR HAD CONCEDED 
THAT ALEXANDRIANS GENERALLY SEEM TO BE READIER TO 
ACCEPT NORMALIZATION (OR AT LEAST TO MEET WITH 
ISRAELIS)       THAN MANY IN CAIRO.  TUVAL ACCEPTED 
MY POINT THAT CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF ALEXANDRIAN 
SOCIETY (NOTABLY THE ISLAMIC RIGHT) PROBABLY DO NOT 
SHARE THIS VIEW.  HOWEVER, HE SAID HE FEELS A 
BROADER AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON 
EGYPTIAN ATTITUDES IS AVAILABLE IN ALEXANDRIA, AND 
HE HOPES OTHER ISRAELI EMBASSY OFFICERS WILL VISIT 
THE CITY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES 
AVAILABLE. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  ABOVE NOTWITHSTANDING, TUVAL COMPLAINED 
ON NOVEMBER 4 ABOUT THE REFUSAL OF SENIOR GOVERNORATE 
OFFICIALS TO ATTEND HIS FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THE ONE 
FOR SASSON.  HE ALLEGED THAT CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT 
EZZAT KADDOUS HAD TOLD HIM UNOFFICIALLY SOME TIME 
AGO THAT THIS IS DONE TO \"SIYASSAT AL-IMTINA\'\", AN 
OFFICIALLY CONDONED \"ABSTENTION POLICY.\"  END COMMENT. 
 
7.  AT HIS MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR, TUVAL SAID 
HE RAISED THE QUESTION OF THE TWO ISRAELI SAILORS 
WHO WERE DETAINED IN EGYPT (RELEASED ON THEIR OWN 
RECOGNIZANCE) IN FEBRUARY 1986 WHILE THEIR CASE 
(ALLEGED HASHISH SMUGGLING) WAS CONSIDERED BY THE 
LOCAL COURTS (SEE REFTEL).  THEY WERE FOUND \"NOT 
GUILTY\" IN EARLY OCTOBER BUT ARE STILL UNABLE TO 
LEAVE EGYPT UNTIL THE DECISION IS REVIEWED.  TUVAL 
ASKED THE GOVERNOR TO INTERVENE OR AT LEAST USE 
HIS GOOD OFFICES TO EXPEDITE MATTERS, BUT THE 
LATTER DECLINED.  HE EVINCED IRRITATION THAT GAWSAQI, 
WHO IS A JUDGE BY TRAINING, WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE A 
CLEAR EXPLANATION OF WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE VERDICT 
REVIEW PROCESS.  AT NOVEMBER 4 DINNER, TUVAL WAS 
EVEN MORE PERPLEXED THAT THE SAILORS HAD STILL NOT 
BEEN REMOVED FROM THE DEPARTURE \"BLACKLIST\" BECAUSE OF 
CONTINUING BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS.  HE EXPRESSED THE 
HOPE THE CASE WOULD NOT BECOME A BILATERAL ISSUE. 
 
 
POST SUMMIT DEVELOPMENTS: 
------------------------ 
8.  I ASKED TUVAL IF HE HAD DETECTED ANY CHANGES IN 
LOCAL ATTITUDES TOWARD ISRAEL SINCE THE SEPTEMBER 
SUMMIT.  HE SAID HE FOUND THE FEW GOVERNORATE 
OFFICIALS HE MEETS REGULARLY TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE 
RELAXED IN HIS PRESENCE.  ALSO, HIS CONSULATE HAS 
RECEIVED A RECENT INCREASE IN INQUIRIES FROM LOCAL 
TRAVEL AGENTS ABOUT TOURISM, AND HE HAS MET WITH 
ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM A LOCAL TRAVEL AGENCY. 
HOWEVER, TUVAL SAID HE DOES NOT EXPECT ANY UPSURGE 
IN EGYPTIAN SIGHTSEERS.  HE IS HOPEFUL, HOWEVER, 
THAT A LARGER NUMBER OF JEWISH PILGRIMS WILL ATTEND 
THIS YEAR\'S COMMEMORATIVE BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS AT 
THE TOMB OF THE VENERATED 19TH CENTURY RABBI YACOUB 
ABU HASIRAH NEAR DAMANHOUR. 
 
 
ZIM LINES: 
---------- 
9.  ZIM CONTINUES TO DO ADEQUATELY IN ALEXANDRIA, 
DESPITE EGYPT\'S CURRENT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND 
THE FALLOFF IN TRADE.  ALTHOUGH I DID NOT RAISE THIS 
SUBJECT WITH TUVAL, THE COMPANY\'S LOCAL AGENT SAID 
RECENTLY THAT ZIM NOW OFFERS A CONTAINER SERVICE 
TWICE MONTHLY.  BUSINESS WITH EAST ASIA IS PARTICULARLY 
GOOD.  EACH SHIP IS ALSO ABLE TO PICK UP FROM 50 TO 60 
CONTAINERS ON EACH OUTWARD VOYAGE, AN ACHIEVEMENT THE 
AGENT IS ESPECIALLY PROUD OF.  LEADING EXPORTS 
CARRIED BY ZIM INCLUDE COTTON AND TEXTILES, USUALLY OF 
ASIAN OR EUROPEAN DESTINATIONS. 
 
 
DELTA AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES: 
----------------------------- 
10.  TUVAL SAID ISRAEL HAS TWO ONGOING AGRICULTURAL 
ACTIVITIES IN THE DELTA.  THE OLDEST IS THE TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE PROJECT UNDERTAKEN BY AN EXPERT NAMED 
KEIDAR (RESIDENT IN CAIRO) AT A FARM NEAR TANTA. 
(THERE IS ONE ZVI KEIDAR ON THE ISRAELI EMBASSY 
DIP LIST WHO MAY BE THE EXPERT MENTIONED.)  A VERY 
RECENT UNDERTAKING IS A JOINT GOVERNMENT-TO- 
GOVERNMENT AGRICULTURAL VENTURE NEAR THE DELTA TOWN 
OF GIANCLIS.  TUVAL SAID THIS PROJECT IS ALSO 
GOING WELL AND THAT A RESIDENT EXPERT IS PRESENT, 
BUT HE DID NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS. (COMMENT: 
I ASKED IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO VISIT THESE 
TWO PROJECTS SOME DAY AS BOTH ARE IN MY CONSULAR 
DISTRICT.  TUVAL SAID NO.  EVEN HE AND OTHER 
ISRAELIS ARE NOT NORMALLY ALLOWED TO VISIT THE SITES 
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR \"LOW PROFILE\" NATURE. 
HOWEVER, TUVAL SAID HE HOPES TO VISIT THEM WITH 
AMBASSADOR SASSON IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND WOULD BRIEF 
ME AT THAT TIME.  END COMMENT.) 
 
11.  ANOTHER AGRICULTURALLY-REALTED PROJECT WE ARE 
AWARE OF IS PURELY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND IS 
DIRECTED BY ONE BENNY DUMAI (PHONETIC), A RESIDENT 
OF CAIRO, WHO HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS IN INTRODUCING 
ISRAELI DRIP IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES TO PRIVATE 
EGYPTIAN ENTREPRENEURS.  ONE SUCH ENTREPRENEUR IS 
AN ALEXANDRIAN WHO HAS USED DUMAI\'S TECHNOLOGY TO 
IMPROVE THE CULTIVATION OF PEARS AND OTHER FRUIT 
ON HIS FARM IN THE CITY\'S SUBURBS.  THIS EGYPTIAN 
WAS FULSOME IN HIS PRAISE FOR DUMAI, HIS TECHNOLOGY, 
AND WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR HIS FARM.  AT THE SAME TIME, 
HE NOTED THAT DUMAI WORKS VERY QUIETLY AND WITHOUT 
MUCH PUBLICITY (TUVAL SAID HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE 
NAME).  THE EGYPTIAN LIKEWISE FEELS HE MUST BE 
DISCREET IN HIS DEALINGS WITH THE ISRAELIS (HE WORKS 
AT AIN SHAMS UNIVERSITY).  HE HAS EVEN TAKEN THE 
PRECAUTION OF PUTTING A WALL AROUND THE MAIN CONTROL 
UNIT FOR HIS IRRIGATION SYSTEM TO PREVENT OUTSIDERS 
FROM SEEING THE HEBREW LETTERING ON THE MACHINERY. 
 
 
COTTON: 
------- 
 
12.  THE ISRAELIS ARE APPARENTLY INVOLVED IN SOME 
COTTON DEALINGS HERE AS WELL.  TUVAL IS HAZY ON THE 
DETAILS BUT HE RECALLS THAT SOMEONE FROM EILAT (PERHAPS 
NAMED \"MUKKI;\" TUVAL SAID HE WOULD TRY TO CHECK) 
BEING INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH AN ALEXANDRIA- 
BASED PUBLIC SECTOR COTTON COMPANY TO TRADE OR SELL 
ISRAELI SHORT FIBER COTTON IN EXCHANGE FOR EGYPT\'S 
MUCH PRIZED LONG FIBER VARIETY.  (COMMENT:  U.S. 
COTTON PRODUCERS HAVE A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT WHICH IS 
PROFITABLE AND ADVANTAGEOUS FOR BOTH OF THE PARTIES 
INVOLVED.  WE WILL REPORT ON DETAILS ABOUT THE 
ISRAELI ARRANGEMENTS AS AVAILABLE.  END COMMENT.) 
 
ISRAELI CONGEN ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE ALEXANDRIA: 
-------------------------------------------- 
13.  TUVAL\'S CONSULAR DISTRICT INCLUDES FOR PROVINCES: 
ALEXANDRIA, BUHAYRA, KAFR AL-SHAYKH, AND DAQAHILIYAH 
(MANSURA).  THUS FAR, HE HAS ONLY VISITED THE 
BUHAYRA IN THE HINTERLAND, PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THE 
GOVERNORS OF KAFR AL-SHAYKH AND DAQAHILIYAH HAVE 
NEVER RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR APPOINTMENTS.  HE 
SAID HE PLANS TO TRY TO CALL ON THEM WITHOUT 
APPOINTMENTS SOMETIME BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. 
 
 
TUVAL\'S FUTURE: 
-------------- 
14.  TUVAL\'S SUBORDINATES HAVE MENTIONED RECENTLY 
TO FRIENDS ON CONGEN STAFF THAT TUVAL WILL BE 
LEAVING HIS POST IN EARLY 1987.  ISRAELI MFA IS 
ALLEGED TO BE LOOKING FOR A SUCCESSOR WHO IS 
\"PUBLIC RELATIONS MINDED.\"  THE ZIM LINE AGENT HAS 
ALSO TOLD US THAT TUVAL MAY BE DEPARTING \"SOON.\" 
TUVAL HIMSELF IS MUM ON THE SUBJECT. ASKED NOVEMBER 4 
HOW LONG A NORMAL TOUR OF DUTY IS, TUVAL (WHO ARRIVED 
IN 1984) REPLIED \"THREE TO FOUR YEARS.\" 
 
15.  COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH I SEE TUVAL ON A REGULAR 
BASIS, AND WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP, THE MEETINGS 
ARE USUALLY AT MY INITIATIVE.  TUVAL IS NOT AS ACTIVE 
AS HIS PREDECESSOR AND PROBABLY HAS NOT OPENED AS 
MANY DOORS AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE.  THE SEPARATION 
FROM HIS FAMILY (RESIDENT IN JERUSALEM FOR SCHOOLING) 
HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL IN THIS REGARD.  ON THE OTHER HAND, 
HE IS PLEASANT, NOT PUSHY, AND HAS GONE OUT OF HIS 
WAY TO UNDERSTAND EGYPTIAN VIEWPOINTS AND PUT DOMESTIC 
EVENTS IN EGYPT INTO A BROADER CONTEXT.  IT IS 
APPARENT THAT HE IS NEITHER HELPED NOR ENCOURAGED BY 
HIS EMBASSY IN CAIRO IN HIS VARIOUS UNDERTAKINGS. 
HE CONSULTS REGULARLY, BUT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE KEPT 
IN THE INFORMATION LOOP.  WITHOUT HIS AMBASSADOR\'S 
FULL UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT, IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE 
HOW HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO DO MUCH BETTER AS A 
WELL-INFORMED AND EFFECTIVE PROPONENT OF IMPROVED 
EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI TIES.  TUVAL IS ASSISTED IN HIS

1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
- 
- 
ALEXANDRIA\'S RADICAL PAST... 
---------------------------- 
2.  PERHAPS IN KEEPING WITH ITS REPUTATION AS A 
CENTER OF DISSENT, IN THE 1970\'S, ISLAMIC RIGHT 
ACTIVITIES IN ALEXANDRIA WERE FOCUSED ON THE 
POLITICAL:  THE RADICAL \"SHIBAB MUHAMMAD\" 
ORGANIZATION, WHICH TRIED TO OVERTHROW SADAT 
IN 1974, AND THE FIRST RENDITION OF \"AL-JIHAD\" 
WHICH WAS ACTIVE IN 1979-81, DREW MANY OF THEIR 
LEADERS AND ADHERENTS FROM ALEXANDRIA AND LARGE 
DELTA TOWNS--IN CONTRAST TO \"AL-TAKFIR W\'AL-HIJRA\" 
AND LATER RADICAL ORGANIZATIONS WHICH WERE ORGANIZED 
AND FOCUSED ON CAIRO AND UPPER EGYPT.  MORE VISIBLY, 
TWO ALEXANDRIA-BASED RELIGIOUS LEADERS, SHAYKHS 
MAHALLAWI AND EID, GALVANIZED A LARGE, VOCAL, AND 
YOUTHFUL FOLLOWING BETWEEN 1977-81 THROUGH THEIR 
POLEMICS (ALBEIT NON-VIOLENT) AGAINST SADAT 
AND CAMP DAVID AND THEIR EXHORTATIONS IN FAVOR OF 
AN ISLAMIC-STYLE REPUBLIC. 
- 
- 
... AND LOWER PROFILE PRESENT 
----------------------------- 
3.  THE SITUATION IN ALEXANDRIA IS CONSIDERABLY 
DIFFERENT IN 1987.  IN CONTRAST TO THE DAYS WHEN 
MAHALLAWI AND EID WERE IMPORTANT FIGURES ON THE 
NATIONAL POLITICAL SCENE, NO CURRENT LOCAL FIGURE 
CAN BE SAID AT PRESENT TO HAVE SUCH AN INFLUENCE 
OR A FOLLOWING.  EXTREMIST ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS 
SUPPORTING VIOLENCE PROBABLY HAVE ADHERENTS, BUT 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ALEXANDRIA IS A PARTICULAR 
CENTER FOR THESE GROUPS. 
- 
- 
4.  HOWEVER, RADICAL (BUT NON-VIOLENT) ISLAMIC 
ORGANIZATIONS (AND ESPECIALLY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
AND THE VARIOUS ISLAMIC GROUPS OR \"GAMAAT\") 
RETAIN UNTESTED BUT CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL CLOUT. 
THIS IS BEST EVIDENCED BY THE LATTER\'S SUCCESS IN 
RECENT UNIVERSITY STUDENT UNION ELECTIONS (86 
ALEXANDRIA 1341) AND THE CAREFUL AND SUCCESSFUL 
ORCHESTRATION OF THE MASS PUBLIC PRAYER SERVICES 
IN ALEXANDRIA BY SUPPORTERS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS 
AT THE END OF RAMADAN AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
FEAST OF SACRIFICE (86 ALEXANDRIA 899).  IN 
THIS SENSE, THE ISLAMIC RIGHT\'S LOWER POLITICAL 
PROFILE IN ALEXANDRIA COULD BE MISLEADING.  WHILE 
THERE ARE DOUBTLESS MANY DIVISONS BETWEEN VARIOUS 
FACTIONS, THERE ARE ALSO SUGGESTIONS THAT THE 
ISLAMIC RIGHT, HOWEVER AMORPHOUS, IS BETTER 
ORGANIZED, DISCIPLINED, AND FINANCED THAN SOME 
OBSERVERS SUGGEST.  THE BIG QUESTION MARK IS 
THE EXTENT TO WHICH VARIOUS GROUPS IN ALEXANDRIA 
HAVE LINKAGES AMONG THEMSELVES OR WITH NATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE SEMI-LEGAL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. 
THIS ISSUE WILL BE ADDRESSED IN PART II. 
- 
- 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IN-ROADS 
---------------------------- 
5.  WHERE THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IS MORE READILY HAVING 
ITS INFLUENCE FELT (AND RAPID GROWTH OBSERVED) IS 
IN COMMERCE, SOCIAL AND WELFARE ACTIVITIES, AND 
PHILANTHROPY.  FOR THE TIME BEING, THIS HAS NOT 
TRANSLATED INTO ANY DIRECT POLITICAL SPOILS, BUT 
THE IMPACT OF ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS IN THESE AREAS HAS 
BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE LOCAL SCENE.  WHILE 
IT MUST BE CONCEDED THAT SOME PEOPLE AFFILIATE 
THEMSELVES WITH SUCH ORGANIZATIONS OR ACTIVITIES 
BECAUSE IT IS CHIC TO DO SO, IT IS NEVERTHELESS 
EQUALLY TRUE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR 
ORGANIZATIONS ARE INCREASING THEIR SHARE OF THE 
LOCAL WEALTH, CREATING JOBS IN AN OTHERWISE 
STAGNANT ECONOMY, AND RESPONDING TO SOCIAL NEEDS 
THAT AN OTHERWISE OVERBURDENED CITY GOVERNMENT 
CANNOT PROVIDE. 
- 
- 
6.  THIS THREE PART REPORT PROVIDES A FIRST TENTATIVE 
MICROSCOPIC VIEW OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA: 
ITS LEADERS, ITS ACTIVITIES, AND ITS IMPACT. 
SOME OF THE PERSONALITIES HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN 
EARLIER REPORTING; OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN AND ARE 
STILL RELATIVELY UNKNOWN TO US.  VARIOUS OBSERVERS 
ASSESS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR 
ACTIVITIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS:  SOME ARE GENUINELY 
SCARED, FEARING THAT THESE ACTIVISTS, LOADED WITH 
SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS FUNDS, WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE 
A SIGNIFICANT (AND NEGATIVE) POLITICAL IMPACT ON 
EGYPT\'S FUTURE.  OTHERS ARE MORE SANGUINE AND ARGUE 
THAT THE UPSURGE IN ISLAMIC ACTIVISM IS MERELY REFLECTIVE 
OF POPULAR OPINION IN FAVOR OF INCREASED RELIGIOSITY. 
- 
- 
7.  BOTH OF THESE VIEWPOINTS ARE HEARD FREQUENTLY 
IN ALEXANDRIA.  OUR ASSESSMENT IS THAT THERE ARE 
INDEED POSITIVE ASPECTS TO THE CURRENT ACTIVISM 
OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA:  IN A CITY WHERE 
THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS AND LITTLE PROSPECT FOR 
EARLY IMPROVEMENT, THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, NOT INFREQUENTLY, 
IS HELPING TO FILL THE VOID AND, IN THIS MANNER, 
CREATING A MORE STABLE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. 
- 
- 
8.  AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE TOO MANY UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS AS TO WHO IS FINANCING VARIOUS ISLAMIC 
ENTERPRISES AND UNDERTAKINGS AND ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS 
BETWEEN VARIOUS ISLAMIC ENTREPRENEURS AND PHILAN- 
THROPISTS AND NATIONAL OR LOCAL ISLAMIC PERSONALITIES 
AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE A POLITICAL AGENDA WHICH 
IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE GOE.  UNTIL THESE 
QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED, ONE MUST CONTINUE TO VIEW 
THE ISLAMIC RIGHT AND ITS PROPONENTS WITH CONTINUED 
CAUTION AND CURIOSITY. 
- 
- 
9.  PART II IN THIS SERIES WILL IDENTIFY SOME OF 
THE PRINCIPAL SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) POLITICAL 
LEADERS OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA.  THE 
THIRD AND FINAL PART WILL LOOK AT REPRESENTATIVES 
OF THE GROWING ISLAMIC BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND 
ASSESS THEIR ROLE IN COMMERCE, SOCIAL WELFARE, 
AND PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITIES.

2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  THIS TELEGRAM TRANSMITS 
PART II OF OUR REPORT ON THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN 
ALEXANDRIA AND IDENTIFIES SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL 
SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) POLITICAL LEADERS IN 
THIS CITY AND THE MAIN \"RADICAL\" MOSQUES.  WHILE 
THERE ARE DOUBTLESS MANY DIVISIONS BETWEEN VARIOUS 
FACTIONS, THERE ARE ALSO SUGGESTIONS THAT THE 
ISLAMIC RIGHT IS BETTER ORGANIZED THAN SOME 
OBSERVERS SUGGEST.  THIS MAY ACCOUNT, FOR EXAMPLE, 
FOR THE \"ISLAMIC GAMAAT\'S\" RECURRING SUCCESSES 
IN ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY\'S STUDENT UNION ELECTIONS. 
MOREOVER, THE ORGANIZATION, DISCIPLINE, AND WELL- 
FINANCED MASS PUBLIC PRAYER MEETINGS HELD AT THE 
END OF RAMADAN AND THE BEGINNING OF THE \'ID AL-IDHA 
SUGGEST THERE MUST BE MORE LINKAGES BETWEEN 
PRINCIPAL LEADERS AND VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAN 
MEETS THE EYE.  ANOTHER INTERESTING POINT IS THE 
CONTINUED ACTIVISM IN ALEXANDRIA OF MANY OF THE 
ISLAMIC STUDENT LEADERS OF THE 1970\'S, EVEN THOUGH 
THEY HAVE NOW LEFT SCHOOL, ENTERED THE WORK PLACE, 
AND MAINTAIN A LOW PROFILE.  THEY MAY NO LONGER 
BE DEMONSTRATING IN THE STREETS, BUT THEIR 
COMMITMENT TO AN ISLAMIC EGYPT APPEARS, IN MANY 
CASES AT LEAST, UNABATED.  FUTURE POST REPORTING 
WILL ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE THEIR ACTIVITIES AND 
THEIR IMPACT ON ALEXANDRIA\'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT IN GREATER DETAIL.  END SUMMARY AND 
COMMENT. 
- 
- 
THE SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) POLITICAL LEADERS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
3.  WITH PERIODIC EXCEPTIONS, LEADERS OF THE 
ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA NO LONGER CAPTURE 
THE NATIONAL NEWSPAPER HEADLINES AS THEY DID IN 
THE LATE 1970\'S AND EARLY 1980\'S, WHEN TWO 
ALEXANDRIAN CLERICS, AHMAD AL-MAHALLAWI AND 
MAHMUD EID, WERE AMONG  THE BEST KNOWN OF EGYPT\'S 
\"RADICAL\" SHAYKHS.  NEVERTHELESS, THE ISLAMIC 
RIGHT\'S SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) POLITICAL 
RANKS ARE FAR FROM EMPTY.  SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, 
SOME IDENTIFIED OPENLY WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, 
HAVE FOLLOWINGS IN ALEXANDRIA AND CAN BE CONSIDERED 
THE ISLAMIC RIGHT\'S LEADING SPIRITUAL AND (POTENTIALLY) 
POLITICAL LEADERS.  THEY ARE BUTTRESSED BY THE 
LEADERS OF THE NUMEROUS \"ISLAMIC GAMAAT\" OR 
GROUPS.  THE LATTER ARE FOCUSED LARGELY, BUT 
NOT EXCLUSIVELY, ON THE ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY 
CAMPUS.  INCREASINGLY, WE HAVE DETECTED \"GAMAAT\" 
ACTIVITY AMONG YOUNG PROFESSIONALS, AND MANY OF 
THE \"GAMAAT\" LEADERS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY 
ARE DRAWN FROM THIS LATTER CATEGORY.  FINALLY, 
THERE ARE OTHER ISLAMIC RIGHT LEADERS WHO ARE MEMBERS 
OF SECULAR POLITICAL PARTIES.  THESE MEN ARE NOT 
ALL NECESSARILY \"RADICAL\" IN THEIR RELIGIOUS 
VIEWPOINTS, AND SOME ARE CONSIDERED POLITICAL 
OPPORTUNISTS WHO HAVE SIMPLY \"ADOPTED\" THE ISLAMIC 
TREND IN ORDER TO FURTHER THEIR OWN POLITICAL 
AMBITIONS.  WHETHER THEY WILL SURVIVE THE ELECTORAL 
LIST VETTING NOW UNDERWAY IN PREPARATION FOR 
THE APRIL 6 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 
- 
- 
4.  JUST AS INDIVIDUAL LEADERS ARE NO LONGER AS 
VISIBLE AS THEY WERE, SO TOO IS IT DIFFICULT TO 
PINPOINT INDIVIDUAL MOSQUES AS PARTICULAR \"HOTBEDS\" 
OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT.  IN THIS MESSAGE, WE HAVE 
DENOTED SEVERAL OF THE MOSQUES WITH ACTIVE IMAMS 
AND CONGREGATIONS, BUT NONE OF THEM APPROACHES, 
EITHER SYMBOLICALLY OR POLITICALLY, THE IMPORTANCE 
WHICH SHAYKH AL-MAHALLAWI\'S \"QA\'ID IBRAHIM\" 
MOSQUE HAD BEFORE 1981. 
- 
- 
5.  WHAT THIS ALL MEANS IS OPEN TO DEBATE.  SOME 
INSIST, UNCONVINCINGLY, THAT THE ISLAMIC LEADERSHIP 
IN ALEXANDRIA, AS ELSEWHERE IN EGYPT, HAS NO 
CENTRAL ORGANIZATION.  THEY DEPICT THE ISLAMIC 
RIGHT HERE AS BEING LITTLE MORE THAN NUMEROUS, 
HIGHLY INDIVIDUALISTIC, RELIGIOUS GROUPS WITH NO 
COMMON AGENDA AND LITTLE CONTACT AMONG ONE 
ANOTHER WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THEIR SUCCESS IN 
LOCAL ELECTIONS HAS BEEN MODEST. 
- 
- 
6.  OTHER INFORMED OBSERVERS (INCLUDING A GOOD 
SOURCE IN STATE SECURITY) ARE CONVINCED THAT THE 
LEADERS OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT CONSCIOUSLY ADOPTED 
A \"LOWER PROFILE\" IN ORDER TO AVOID RENEWED GOE 
RETRIBUTION ON THE SCALE OF SADAT\'S 1981 CRACKDOWN 
WHILE DEVELOPING ROOTS AMONG THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
AND FOLLOWERS.  WHILE CONCEDING THAT THERE IS 
COMPETITION AMONG VARIOUS ELEMENTS COMPRISING THE 
ISLAMIC RIGHT, THEY POINT BOTH TO PRESIDENT SADAT\'S 
1981 ASSERTION THAT THE \"ISLAMIC GAMAAT\" ARE 
ESSENTIALLY AN MB-SPONSORED UNDERGROUND AND TO THE 
ISLAMIC RIGHT\'S WELL-COORDINATED ORCHESTRATION OF 
UNIVERSITY STUDENT UNION ELECTIONS AND THE MASS 
PUBLIC PRAYER MEETINGS AT THE ALEXANDRIA STADIUM 
WHICH MOBILIZE OVER 100,000 WORSHIPPERS TWICE YEARLY. 
- 
- 
7.  WE HAVE DIVIDED THE ISLMAIC RIGHT\'S SPIRITUAL 
LEADERSHIP IN ALEXANDRIA INTO THREE SEPARATE 
CATEGORIES.  AS NONE OF THESE MEN CURRENTLY HOLDS 
AN IMPORTANT POSITION (ASIDE FROM POSSIBLE 
MEMBERSHIP) WITHIN A POLITICAL PARTY, THE SEMI-LEGAL 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OR ANY OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPING, 
THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE IS STILL MORE POTENTIAL 
THAN REAL.  ON THE ONE HAND, THERE IS NO WAY OF 
KNOWING AS YET THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY HARBOR 
PERSONAL POLITICAL AMBITIONS.  ON THE OTHER, 
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT PROPITIOUS FOR THEM TO ENTER 
THE POLITICAL ARENA EVEN IF THEY SHOULD WANT TO. 
- 
- 
8.  PRINCIPAL INFLUENCES: 
- 
- 
(A)  AHMAD AL-MAHALLAWI, IMAM OF AL-QA\'ID IBRAHIM 
MOSQUE:  SINCE HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 1982, 
AL-MAHALLAWI HAS TAKEN A LOWER PROFILE IN 
ISLAMIC AFFAIRS.  USUALLY HIS FRIDAY SERMONS 
FOCUS ON RELIGIOUS MATTERS, NOT POLITICS (ONE 
EXCEPTION WAS HIS ANTI-ISRAEL BLAST FOLLOWING 
THE SEPTEMBER 1986 ALEXANDRIA SUMMIT).  AN 
ASCETIC TYPE WHO LIVES HUMBLY, AL-MAHALLAWI IS 
QUITE ALOOF AND DOES NOT IMPRESS A WESTERNER AS 
A PERSONALITY WITH MUCH CHARISMA.  NEVERTHELESS, 
HE RETAINS CONSIDERABLE STATURE IN ALEXANDRIA 
AND HAS A DEVOTED FOLLOWING.  ACCORDING TO 
OPPOSIION PRESS REPORTS, IT WAS AL-MAHALLAWI\'S 
ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS A MOSQUE IN ASYUT LAST YEAR 
WHICH SPARKED A SERIOUS CLASH BETWEEN ISLAMIC 
RADICALS AND SECURITY POLICE.  IN GENERAL, AL- 
MAHALLAWI\'S RHETORIC HAS MELLOWED IN RECENT 
YEARS, ALTHOUGH HE REMAINS A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE 
OF AN ISLAMIC STATE.  SINCE THE SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT 
OF NEW PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, RUMORS HAVE 
CIRCULATED THAT AL-MAHALLAWI WILL BE A CANDIDATE 
FOR ONE OF THE INDEPENDENT SEATS.  IF HE RUNS (AND 
IF THE ELECTIONS ARE FAIR), OBSERVERS BELIEVE HE WILL 
BE DIFFICULT TO BEAT. 
- 
- 
(B)  MAHMOUD EID (AKA MAHMUD \'ID):  ALONG WITH 
AL-MAHALLAWI, EID WAS VERY ACTIVE IN THE LATE 1970\'S. 
HE HAS SPENT MOST OF THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE 
GULF, ALTHOUGH HE IS SAID TO RETAIN A DEVOTED 
FOLLOWING IN ALEXANDRIA.  HE IS ALSO ALLEGED TO 
RETAIN SEVERAL OF THE RADICAL ISLAMIC VIEWS 
WHICH GOT HIM INTO TROUBLE WITH THE LATE PRESIDENT 
SADAT. 
- 
- 
(C)  MUHAMMAD AL-MARAGHI:  A WAFDIST MEMBER OF THE 
PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, AL-MARAGHI IS KNOWN LOCALLY AS 
A LEADING MEMBER OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
AND SPIRITUAL LEADER TO SOME OF THE \"ISLAMIC 
GAMAAT\" (GROUPS) IN THE CITY.  IN HIS LATE FORTIES 
OR EARLY FIFTIES, HE IS KNOWN AS A FORCEFUL 
SPEAKER WHO IS TOTALLY COMMITTED TO AN ISLAMIC 
STATE IN EGYPT.  HOSTILE TO THE U.S. AND ITS 
POLICIES.  AL-MARAGHI SEEMS TO HAVE ALMOST AS 
MANY DETRACTORS AS HE HAS ADMIRERS, AND HIS 
REELECTION TO THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY IN THE FORTHCOMING 
ELECTIONS IS IN DOUBT. 
- 
- 
(D)  ADEL EID (AKA ADIL \'ID):  AN ARTICULATE AND 
RADICAL ALEXANDRIAN LAWYER, EID IS ALLEGED TO 
HAVE CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN RADICAL ISLAMIC 
CIRCLES AND, LIKE AL-MARAGHI, TO BE THE SPIRITUAL 
LEADER OF SOME LOCAL \"ISLAMIC GAMAAT.\"  ARDENTLY 
ANTI-U.S. AND ANTI-ISRAEL, HE ONCE INDICATED HE 
WOULD ONLY COME TO CG\'S RESIDENCE IF HE COULD BE 
CONVINCED \"NO ISRAELIS WERE PRESENT.\"  HE WASN\'T, 
AND HE DIDN\'T COME.  EID IS ALSO MENTIONED AS A 
POSSIBLE CANDIDATE FOR THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY. 
- 
- 
(E)  YASSIN RUSHDI:  RUSHDI WAS ALLEGEDLY A 
MUSLIM BROTHER AT ONE TIME.  HE IS A FORMER NAVAL 
OFFICER WHO WAS BOOTED OUT OF THE MILITARY BY 
NASSER FOR HIS ISLAMIC ACTIVISM.  NOT RESPECTED 
AS A SCHOLAR (HE HAS NO SUCH CREDENTIALS), 
RUSHDI IS NEVERTHELESS KNOWN AS A CHARISMATIC 
AND ARTICULATE LEADER WHO HAS A LARGE AND DEVOTED 
FOLLOWING DRAWN FROM THE MIDDLE AND UPPER MIDDLE 
CLASSES.  HIS SERMONS AND LECTURES ARE AVAILABLE 
ON WIDELY-SOLD TAPES.  RUSHDI\'S LARGE AND TASTEFUL 
MOSQUE (\"AL-MOWASSAT\") IS JAMMED AT PRAYER TIMES 
AND FOR HIS EVENING LECTURES.  HE IS KNOWN GENERALLY 
TO SHY AWAY FROM POLITICAL SUBJECTS AND EMPHASIZE 
PERSONAL PIETY.  ABOUT FIFTY, HE WELL OFF OWING 
TO A CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS HE OPERATES ON THE 
SIDE.  BECAUSE OF HIS ALLEGED MAGNETIC HOLD ON 
UPPER CLASS WOMEN, HE HAS BEEN TERMED BY SOME HERE 
AS \"THE RASPUTIN OF ALEXANDRIA.\" 
- 
- 
9.  LEADERS OF ALEXANDRIA\'S \"ISLAMIC GAMAAT\": 
- 
- 
(A)  AHMAD MAHMUD NAFIS HAMDI:  A LEADER OF THE 
\"ISLAMIC GAMAAT\" AT ALEXANDRIA UNIVERSITY\'S 
ENGINEERING FACULTY, HAMDI WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT 
OF THE STUDENT UNION IN EARLY DECEMBER 1986. 
VERY RELIGIOUS, HE IS SAID TO BE NON-CONFRONTATIONAL 
AND VERY PERSONABLE. 
- 
- 
(B)  WAGIH MUHAMMAD ABU HALIMA:  CURRENTLY VICE 
PRESIDENT OF THE ALEXANDRIA STUDENT UNION, ABU 
HALIMA IS ONE OF THE \"GAMAAT\" LEADERS IN THE 
MEDICAL SCHOOL, THE FACULTY WHICH PERHAPS SHOWS 
MORE ISLAMIC MANIFESTATIONS THAN ANY OF THE 
OTHERS.  HE IS SAID TO BE MORE VOCAL AND AMBITIOUS 
THAN HAMDI. 
- 
- 
(C)  KHALID ABD AL-RAHMAN AL-ZAFARANI:  HEAD OF 
THE PHYSICIANS SYNDICATE IN ALEXANDRIA, 
AL-ZAFARANI ACCORDING TO ONE SOURCE IS FRIENDLY 
WITH (AND ONCE THE EMPLOYEE OF) DR. ALI MEHELBA, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE ANDALUS ACID COMPANY (SEE PART III). 
AL-ZAFARANI IS VERY ACTIVE IN THE \"GAMAAT\" 
MOVEMENT.  IN HIS MID-30\'S, HE HAS FLIRTED WITH 
VARIOUS FACTIONS OVER THE PAST DECADE, INCLUDING 
\"AL-TAKFIR W\'AL-HIJRA\" IN ITS FORMATIVE YEARS. 
CURRENT ORGANIZATIONAL AFFILIATIONS ARE UNKNOWN. 
AL-ZAFARANI IS SAID TO BE CHARISMATIC.  HE AVOIDS 
WESTERNERS AND STAYS OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT.  STATE 
SECURITY TELLS US HE WAS A LEADER OF THE \"GAMAAT\" 
MOVEMENT EARLY IN THE DECADE AND WAS IMPRISONED 
FOR HIS ACTIVITIES IN 1981.  HE CONTINUES TO BE 
UNDER SURVEILLANCE.  MANY SOURCES IN ISLAMIC CIRCLES 
HERE BELIEVE AL-ZAFARANI MAY BE CONSIDERING A HIGHER 
PROFILE.  THEY HAVE SUGGESTED TO US HE MAY BECOME 
A CANDIDATE FOR THE APRIL 6 PEOPLES ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS. 
- 
- 
(D)  SAMIH SAID HASAN AL-SABA:  CURRENTLY 27 YEARS 
OLD AND THE FORMER HEAD OF THE \"GAMAAT\" IN THE 
ALEXANDRIA MEDICAL FACULTY, AL-SABA WAS IMPRISONED 
IN 1981 AND SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASED.  HE IS 
ALLEGEDLY A FOLLOWER OF AL-ZAFARANI, AND STATE 
SECURITY ALLEGES SOMETIMES ENGAGES IN ANTI-REGIME 
AND ANTI-AMERICAN PAMPHLETERRING (THE LAST TIME 
APPARENTLY DURING THE \"ACHILLE LAURO\" EPISODE). 
- 
- 
(E)  SABRI NUR:  IN HIS FIFTIES, NUR IS AN OLDER, 
BUT CHARISMATIC AND ARTICULATE, LEADER OF ONE 
OF THE ISLAMIC GROUPS IN ALEXANDRIA WHICH IS 
BELIEVED TO SUPPORT SHAYKH SALAH ABU ISMAIL. 
NUR VOICES AN EXTREMIST POLITICAL AGENDA AND 
CLAIMS TO HAVE A LARGE AND YOUTHFUL  FOLLOWING. 
HE IS PERIODICALLY THE SUBJECT OF PRESS INTERVIEWS 
AND COMMENTARY IN THE LIBERALS\' WEEKLY NEWSPAPER, 
\"AL-AHRAR.\" 
- 
- 
(F)  AHMAD AL-SAYYID HATAYBA:  TWENTY-NINE YEARS 
OF AGE, HATAYBA WAS THE HEAD OF THE ISLAMIC 
GROUP IN THE ALEXANDRIA FACULTY OF DENTISTRY 
UNTIL HIS 1981 ARREST.  HE IS CONSIDERED MORE 
POLITICIZED THAN SOME OF HIS FELLOW \"GAMAAT\" 
LEADERS AND IS SAID TO FREQUENTLY CRITICIZE GOE 
POLICIES. 
- 
- 
(G)  FAHMI MUHAMMAD AMER:  ANOTHER OF AL-ZAFARANI\'S 
ALLEGED PROTEGES, AMER IN THE PAST HAS BEEN 
ACTIVE IN THE \"FAJR AL-ISLAM\" MOVEMENT (SEE 
PART III).  HE WAS A LEADER OF THE \"GAMAAT\" 
MOVEMENT IN THE FACULTY OF ARTS DURING HIS 
STUDENT YEARS. 
- 
- 
(H)  MAJDI MUHAMMAD HASAN RAJAB WARDA (AKA 
MAGDI WARDA):  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PINPOINT 
THE MOSQUE WHERE WARDA IS CURRENTLY ACTIVE. 
HOWEVER, WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN HIS ACTIVE YEARS 
AT ALEXANDRIA\'S LAW FACULTY HE WAS A VOCAL AND 
HARSH CRITIC OF THE COPTS AND STILL DELIVERS 
ANTI-CHRISTIAN  AND ANTI-JEWISH POLEMICS PERIODICALLY 
FROM ANY ONE OF THE DOZENS OF PRIVATE MOSQUES 
IN THE CITY. 
- 
- 
10.  ISLAMIC VOICES IN THE ALEX BRANCHES OF THE 
SECULAR PARTIES: 
- 
- 
(A)  HAMMAD AL-KHAYYAL:  A NDP MEMBER OF THE 
PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, AL-KHAYYAL IS BEARDED AND 
ESPOUSES RELIGIOUS CAUSES.  ALEXANDRIANS ARE 
SUSPICIOUS OF HIS MOTIVES.  AL-KHAYYAL IS 
ALLEGED BY THESE SOURCES TO BE A LEFTIST WHO 
IS USING HIS NEW ISLAMIC GUISE TO FURTHER HIS 
OWN POLITICAL AIMS.  SOME IN THE NDP ARE TRYING TO 
REMOVE HIM FROM THE PARTY LIST FOR THE FORTHCOMING 
ELECTIONS. 
- 
- 
(B)  AHMAD AL-SHARNOUBI (AKA AL-SHARNUBI):  LIKE 
AL-KHAYYAL, AL-SHARNOUBI IS BEARDED AND STRONGLY 
SUPPORTS ISLAMIC ISSUES (E.G., HE FAVORS 
PROHIBITION AND ADOPTION OF THE \"SHARIA\").  HE 
IS ALSO CONSIDERED BY SOME HERE AS A CLOSET LEFTIST. 
HE IS AN NDP MEMBER OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY.  SOME 
LOCAL PARTY OFFICIALS WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM REMOVED 
FROM THE FORTHCOMING PARTY LIST. 
- 
- 
(C)  MUSTAFA EL GUEINDY (AKA MUSTAFA AL-GUINDI): 
CHAIRMAN OF THE RELIGIOUS COMMITTEE OF THE PEOPLES 
ASSEMBLY, AL-GUINDI IS ALSO A SECONDARY SCHOOL 
ARABIC TEACHER AND THE IMAM OF KABARI MOSQUE IN 
WEST ALEXANDRIA.  HE IS VERY RELIGIOUS BUT 
REGARDED AS A MODERATE. 
- 
- 
(D)  DR. AHMAD SAYYID DARWISH:  ACTIVE AS WELL IN 
THE LOCAL BRANCH OF THE LIBERALS (\"AL-AHRAR\") PARTY. 
DARWISH IS THE HEAD OF THE PARTY\'S YOUTH ORGANIZATION 
IN ALBANJNDRIA.  O NIS BEING PROMOTED AS A CANDIDATE 
FOR THE NEW PEOPLES ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS.  HE IS IN 
HIS LATE FIFTIES OR EARLY SIXTIES AND IS SUSPICIOUS 
OF WESTERNERS. 
- 
- 
RADICAL MOSQUES 
--------------- 
11.  IN THE DAYS WHEN THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES 
OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT HAD A HIGH PROFILE IN 
ALEXANDRIA, TWO MOSQUES WERE THE PRINCIPAL 
FOCAL POINTS FOR ALMOST WEEKLY DEMONSTRATIONS: 
MAHALLAWI\'S \"AL-QA\'ID IBRAHIM\" MOSQUE AND \"AL-SALLAM\" 
MOSQUE IN THE BULKLI DISTRICT WHERE SHAYKH MAHMUD 
EID HELD FORTH.  INFLUENCE IS NOW MORE DISPERSED, 
IN PART AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE GOE\'S EFFORTS TO 
BRING MORE OF EGYPT\'S ESTIMATED 40,000 PRIVATE 
OR \"UNOFFICIAL\" MOSQUES UNDER THE CONTROL OF 
THE MINISTRY OF AWQAF.  THIS EFFORT HAS ONLY 
PARTIALLY SUCCEEDED IN ALEXANDRIA WHERE PRIVATELY 
BUILT AND FUNDED MOSQUES CONTINUE TO PROLIFERATE. 
MEMBERS OF THE \"GAMAAT\" FREQUENTLY COMPRISE THE 
BULK OF THE CONGREGATIONS AT THESE MOSQUES, 
WHERE VERY CONSERVATIVE (BUT NOT NECESSARILY 
POLITICAL) MESSAGES ARE PREACHED EACH FRIDAY AND 
DURING VARIOUS WEEKLY STUDY SESSIONS AND PRAYER 
MEETINGS. 
- 
- 
12.  FOLLOWING IS AN ANNOTATED LISTING OF SOME 
OF THE MORE PROMINENT MOSQUES IN ALEXANDRIA WHERE 
THE MORE ACTIVE PROPONENTS OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT 
GATHER: 
- 
- 
(A)  \"AL-QA\'ID IBRAHIM\" MOSQUE:  AL-MAHALLAWI 
HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THIS MOSQUE, AND 
PERIODICALLY HE WILL ATTRACT LOCAL ATTENTION WITH 
PROVOCATIVE REMARKS IN HIS FRIDAY SERMONS.  AT 
PRESENT, IT IS NOT THE CENTER FOR ISLAMIC ACTIVISM 
THAT IT WAS IN 1980. 
- 
- 
(B)  \"AL-SALAM MOSQUE\":  WITH MUHAMMAD EID OUT OF 
THE COUNTRY, THIS MOSQUE IS NO LONGER AS IMPORTANT 
A GATHERING POINT FOR THE ISLAMIC RIGHT AS IT 
ONCE WAS.  HOWEVER, IT IS STILL FREQUENTED BY 
WORSHIPPERS IN VERY CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC ATTIRE. 
- 
- 
(C)  \"ASR AL-ISLAM\" MOSQUE:  LOCATED ON A MAIN 
STREET IN THE SIDI GABR DISTRICT, THIS MOSQUE 
ATTRACTS FULLY VEILED WOMEN AND BEARDED MEN. 
IT HAS NO SPECIFIC IMAM, BUT MUHAMMAD MARAGHI 
IS SAID TO FREQUENT IT, AND UMAR AL-TALMASANI, 
THE LATE MB LEADER, PREACHED THERE IN 1986. 
ONE SERMON RECENTLY OVERHEARD BY A CONGEN EMPLOYEE 
ATTACKED THE WEALTHY HARSHLY FOR NOT HELPING THE 
POOR.  ANTI-CHRISTIAN AND ANTI-JEWISH SERMONS ARE 
REGULARLY PREACHED, AS WELL.  DURING THE SEPTEMBER 1986 
ALEXANDRIA SUMMIT, THEN-PRIME MINISTER PERES WAS 
SCORNED IN VERY INSULTING TERMS.  A MEDICAL CLINIC 
OF THE SAME NAME, FOR WOMEN ONLY, IS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THIS MOSQUE AND IS USUALLY CROWDED.  TREATMENT 
IS SAID TO BE GOOD, AND PRICES ARE AFFORDABLE BY 
MIDDLE CLASS EGYPTIANS. 
- 
- 
(D)  \"FAJR AL-ISLAM\" MOSQUE:  THIS MOSQUE IS 
ALLEGEDLY RUN BY A GROUP CALLING THEMSELVES, 
\"SUPPORTERS OF KHOMEINI\"--A STRANGE APPELATION 
AS MOST DEVOUT SUNNIS DO NOT CONSIDER SHIA TO BE 
MUSLIMS.  SERMONS ARE SAID TO BE FREQUENTLY ANTI- 
CHRISTIAN, ALLEGING FOR EXAMPLE, THAT CHRISTIANS 
ARE ATHEISTS WHO WILL SURELY GO TO HELL. 
- 
- 
(E)  \"FATIH AL-ISLAM\" MOSQUE:  LOCATED IN THE 
EXCLUSIVE RUSHDI DISTRICT WHERE MANY DIPLOMATS 
AND WESTERNERS LIVE, THIS MOSQUE WAS BUILT IN 
WHAT WAS INTENDED TO BE A GARAGE.  MOST OF THE 
CONGREGANTS ARE YOUNG, BEARDED, AND WEAR WHITE 
GALIBIYAS.  FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL, SERMONS TEND 
TO BE APOLITICAL, FOCUSING ON INTERPRETATIONS OF 
KORANIC PASSAGES.  THICK GLOVES AND OTHER 
EXTREMIST ACCOUTREMENTS FOR WOMEN ARE SOLD OUTSIDE 
THE MOSQUE ON FRIDAYS. 
- 
- 
(F)  \"AL-MOAWASSAT\" MOSQUE:  THIS IS THE MOSQUE 
OF YASSIN RUSHDI, THE SO-CALLED \"RASPUTIN\" OF 
THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT IN ALEXANDRIA.  RUSHDI IS 
NOT CONSIDERED A POLITICAL RADICAL, BUT HIS 
MOSQUE IS INCLUDED IN THIS LIST BECAUSE OF THE 
NUMBER OF ADHERENTS WHO GATHER HERE EACH WEEK TO 
LISTEN TO HIS SERMONS AND TEACHINGS.

2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  THIS TELEGRAM TRANSMITS 
THE THIRD AND FINAL INSTALLMENT IN OUR SERIES 
ON THE ISLAMIC RIGHT IN ALEXANDRIA.  WHILE THE 
SPIRITUAL FORCE OF RIGHTIST ISLAM IS GROWING, 
ITS POLITICAL POTENTIAL IS STILL RELATIVELY 
UNFORMED AND DIFFICULT TO GAUGE IN ALEXANDRIA, 
EVEN IF IT EXISTS BEHIND THE SCENES.  WHERE THE 
ISLAMIC RIGHT IS HAVING ITS INFLUENCE MORE 
PALPABLY FELT IS IN COMMERCE, SOCIAL AND WELFARE 
ACTIVITIES, AND PHILANTHROPY.  FOR THE TIME 
BEING, THIS HAS NOT TRANSLATED INTO ANY DIRECT 
POLITICAL SPOILS.  HOWEVER, BUSINESSMEN WITH 
ISLAMIC CREDENTIALS (OR IN ORDER TO OBTAIN 
ISLAMIC CREDENTIALS) DONATE MONEY TO THE \"ISLAMIC 
GAMAAT,\" SOME OF THE PROMINENT RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
MENTIONED IN PART II, AND MANY OF THE WELFARE 
AND CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES THEY SPONSOR.  IN 
THIS WAY, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ISLAMIC ECNOMIC 
SECTOR ARE SOMEWHAT DISTURBING, TENDING TO PROVIDE 
THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING 
SOCIO-POLITICAL GROUPS WHO SOMETIMES HAVE A VERY 
DIFFERENT POLITICAL AGENDA THAN THE GOE.  IN 
OTHER WAYS, HOWEVER, THESE BUSINESSMEN ACTUALLY 
CONTRIBUTE TO THE STABILITY OF THE CURRENT 
REGIME BY PROVIDING A PORTION OF THE SAFETY NET 
AND SERVICES WHICH AN OVERSTRETCHED GOVERNMENT 
CANNOT PROVIDE.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
- 
- 
WHO\'S WHO IN ALEXANDRIA\'S ISLAMIC BUSINESS WORLD? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
3.  AN INCREASING NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN ALEXANDRIA, 
AS ELSEWHERE IN EGYPT, ARE ADDING \"ISLAMIC\" TO 
THEIR TITLES OR--MORE COMMONLY--LETTING WORD 
SPREAD THAT THEY ARE ISLAMIC COMPANIES.  IN 
PRACTICE, THIS SOMETIMES MEANS USING ISLAMIC 
BANKING INSTITUTIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND 
GIVING PREFERENCE TO MUSLIMS AS EMPLOYEES.  IN 
SOME INSTANCES, BUSINESSMEN ARE AFFILIATING 
THEMSELVES WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES OR COMPANIES 
BECAUSE IT IS CHIC TO DO SO.  OTHERS INVOLVE 
THEMSELVES FROM SINCERE CONVICTION, BECAUSE THEY 
HOPE TO PROFIT FROM SUCH ALLIANCES, OR THE 
MOTIVATION MAY BE A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE. 
- 
- 
4.  TWO PILLARS OF THE LOCAL BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT, 
MUSTAFA AL-NAGGAR, AND MOHAMMED RAGAB HAVE LONG 
BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THIS CURRENT, ALTHOUGH THEY 
ARE NOT AFFILIATED DIRECTLY WITH ANY ISLAMIC 
COMPANIES PER SE.  TOGETHER, THEY ARE AMONG THE 
LEADING BENEFACTORS IN ALEXANDRIA TO ISLAMIC 
INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETIES--SOME RADICAL, 
SOME NOT.  FOR EXAMPLE, AL-NAGGAR IS PERSONALLY 
CLOSE TO SHAYKH AHMAD AL-MAHALLAWI, ALTHOUGH HE 
(NAGGAR) NEVER ARTICULATES SIMILARLY INTOLERANT 
POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS VIEWS AND, INDEED, INSISTS 
THAT AL-MAHALLAWI HAS MELLOWED.  NEVERTHELESS, 
NAGGAR IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE TWO WEALTHIEST 
MEN IN ALEXANDRIA, AND HIS SUPPORT FOR THE 
ISLAMIC RIGHT HERE, REGARDLESS OF MOTIVATION, 
IS SIGNIFICANT. 
- 
- 
5.  MOHAMMAD RAGAB IS YOUNGER, MORE DYNAMIC, AND--IN 
THE VIEW OF OUR MUCH PRAISED COMMERCIAL SPECIALISTS--A 
BETTER BUSINESSMAN THAN NAGGAR.  HE IS NOT AS 
WEALTHY, BUT HE IS MORE AMBITIOUS AND OUTSPOKEN. 
A SIGN OVER THE BAR NEXT TO THE OLYMPIC-SIZED 
INDOOR POOL AT HIS SUMPTUOUS HOME ADVERTISES 
THAT \"FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH, THE RAGABS 
SERVE ONLY FRUIT JUICES AND SOFT DRINKS.\" 
- 
- 
6.  THERE IS BAD BLOOD BETWEEN RAGAB AND NAGGAR, 
LARGELY BECAUSE THE FORMER MOVED INTO THE IMPORTED 
FOOD AREA WHICH HAD BEEN NAGGAR\'S MAINSTAY WHEN 
THE CAR IMPORT AND HEAVY MACHINERY BUSINESS, 
WHICH WAS RAGAB\'S PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY, LOST 
VIABILITY WITH THE NEW IMPORT RESTRICTIONS. 
RAGAB CURRENTLY HEADS THE ALEXANDRIA BUSINESSMEN\'S 
GROUP BUT HAS AMBITIONS TO CUT A WIDER SWATH. 
AS EFFECTIVE AS HE IS, HE IS DISLIKED IN SOME 
CIRCLES BECAUSE HE IS VIEWED AS TOO MUCH OF A 
SELF-PROMOTER.  NOT IDENTIFIED WITH ANY ONE 
ISLAMIC SPIRITUAL PERSONALITY IN ALEXANDRIA, RAGAB 
IS ALLEGED TO DONATE CONSIDERABLE SUMS OF MONEY 
TO A VARIETY OF ISLAMIC CHARITIES AND \"ISLAMIC 
GAMAAT.\"  IN ADDITION, HE HAS HELPED PROMOTED 
BUSINESSMEN WHO ARTICULATE A SIMILAR, \"ISLAMIC,\" 
POINT OF VIEW. 
- 
- 
7.  ANOTHER FIGURE WHO IS OF INTEREST LOCALLY IS 
DR. ALI AL-MEHELBA WHO HEADS THE AL-ANDALUS ACID 
COMPANY (DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN 86 ALEXANDRIA 1406). 
TRAINED AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR, AL-MEHELBA MORE OR 
LESS CAME FROM NOWHERE.  HIS CONSTRUCTION 
ACTIVITIES (UPSCALE HOUSING, HOSPITALS, AND 
TOURIST VILLAGE SCHEMES) ARE WIDE SCALE AND ARE 
ALLEGEDLY FINANCED THROUGH SHAREHOLDING AND 
PYRAMID FINANCING IN A WAY TO AVOID THE APPEARANCE 
OF PAYING \"INTEREST.\"  HOWEVER, HE APPEARS TO 
HAVE OVER EXTENDED HIMSELF, AND LOCAL SOURCES 
TELL US HE MAY BE IN TROUBLE.  THIS HAS NOT 
STOPPED HIM, HOWEVER, FROM PLANNING ADDITIONAL 
PROJECTS. 
- 
- 
8.  MEHELBA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CLOSE TIES AND 
\"FRIENDS\" IN SAUDI ARABIA.  HE MAINTAINS BRANCHES 
OF HIS FIRM THERE, IN PART TO ELICIT FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT FROM THE LARGE EXPATRIATE EGYPTIAN 
COMMUNITY WHO OFTEN INVEST IN HIS CONSTRUCTION 
PROJECTS.  IT IS ALSO RUMORED THAT UNIDENTIFIED 
SAUDI SOURCES GAVE MEHELBA HIS INITIAL BOOST 
AND MAY ALSO BE CALLED UPON TO RESCUE HIM IF HIS 
CURRENT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS ARE NOT RESOLVED. 
- 
- 
9.  TWO OTHER INTERESTING BUSINESS FIGURES HAVE 
ALLEGED TIES TO SAUDI ARABIA.  ONE, TALAAT 
MUSTAFA IBRAHIM (USUALLY KNOWN AS TALAAT MUSTAFA) 
RUNS THE HUGE ALEXANDRIA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY. 
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHERE MUSTAFA GOT HIS ORIGINAL 
SEED MONEY:  ALEXANDRIANS ARE SUSPICIOUS THAT 
MUSLIM BROTHERS (MANY OF WHOM WERE EXILED IN 
SAUDI ARABIA) HELPED HIM OBTAIN SAUDI BACKING 
IN THE MID-1970\'S. 
- 
- 
10.  IN ANY EVENT, MUSTAFA TENDS TO WEAR HIS 
ISLAM ON HIS SLEEVE, WHILE HIS WIFE, WHO WEARS 
THE \"HEGAB\" OR HEAD COVERING, HAS MADE HERSELF 
UNWELCOME IN SOME QUARTERS BECAUSE OF HER INCESSANT 
EXHORTATIONS TO OTHER UPPER CLASS WOMEN TO DO 
LIKEWISE.  MUSTAFA\'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL MOVE TO 
DATE HAS BEEN THE PLACEMENT OF A LARGE, AND 
HIGHLY VISIBLE BILLBOARD, WITH THE ISLAMIC CREED 
EMBLAZONED ON IT, ON TOP OF ONE OF HIS BUILDINGS 
(86 ALEXANDRIA 1425).  HE HAS VERY CLOSE RELATIONS 
WITH MUHAMMED RAGAB, AND THE LATTER HAS BEEN 
ACCUSED BY DETRACTORS OF TRYING TO PROMOTE HIM 
INTO A KEY POSITION WITHIN THE ALEXANDRIA 
BUSINESSMEN\'S GROUP.  TOGETHER, THE TWO WERE 
RECENTLY INVOLVED IN A CONTROVERSIAL (BUT NOT 
UNPOPULAR) PROPOSAL TO BUILD AN ISLAMIC-ORIENTED 
PRIVATE COLLEGE IN ALEXANDRIA.  THE MINISTER OF 
EDUCATION RECENTLY QUASHED THE IDEA ON CURRICULUM 
GROUNDS, BUT MOVES ARE UNDERWAY TO TRY TO RESUSCITATE IT. 
- 
- 
11.  ANOTHER \"MYSTERIOUS\" BUSINESSMAN WHO IS 
BECOMING PROMINENT IS HAJJ AHMED EBEID (AKA 
AHMAD UBAYD).  HE IS AFFILIATED WITH TWO ISLAMIC 
INVESTMENT COMPANIES.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 
SUGGESTIONS THAT EBEID IS AFFILIATED WITH ALI 
AL-MEHELBA, BUT THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED. 
- 
- 
ALEXANDRIA ACTIVITIES OF ISLAMIC COMPANIES AND BANKS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
12.  THERE ARE SEVERAL \"ISLAMIC COMPANIES\" BASED 
IN ALEXANDRIA, INCLUDING AL-ANDALUS ACID 
(MENTIONED ABOVE), AL-MADINA AL-MINAWARA (REAL 
ESTATE DEVELOPMENT), AL-MARWA, AL-SAFAA, AND THE 
ALEXANDRIA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, AN OLDER 
COMPANY FOUNDED IN 1974.  A FORMER GOVERNOR OF 
ALEXANDRIA TOLD US ON JANUARY 29 THAT THE 
ISLAMIC COMPANIES ARE HEALTHY, GROWING RAPIDLY, 
AND THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE. 
- 
- 
13.  THE LARGEST SUCH FIRM (AND ONE OF THE OLDEST) 
IS PROBABLY TALAAT MUSTAFA\'S ALEXANDRIA 
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY.  THIS COMPANY HAS BUILT 
600 FLATS IN MONTAZA AND IS CONSTRUCTING SUMMER 
FLATS IN MAMOURA.  TO THE WEST OF THE CITY, IT 
CONSTRUCTED ITS FIRST PROJECT AND A PLANT TO 
EXTRACT SALTS IN 1974 AND BUILT 1,500 FLATS TO 
ACCOMMODATE THE WORKERS. 
- 
- 
14.  IN AN OCTOBER 1986 DISCUSSION, MUSTAFA 
STATED THAT HIS COMPANY, LIKE MANY OTHERS, PUTS 
ITS MONEY IN THE FAYSAL BANK AND OTHER ISLAMIC 
BANKS BECAUSE THEY \"TRUST\" THEM AND ALSO, BECAUSE 
THEY CAN TAKE DOLLARS OUT OF EGYPT \"IF OR WHEN 
NECESSARY.\"  HE FLATLY DENIED THAT FUNDS FOR 
ISLAMIC COMPANIES COME FROM SAUDIS OR THE SAG, 
ALLEGING THAT THE MONEY COMES SOLELY FROM EGYPTIAN 
EXPATS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND THE GULF WHO WANT TO 
INVEST IN EGYPT, BUY FLATS, AND WHO HAVE \"MORE 
TRUST\" IN ISLAMIC INSTITUTIONS THAN IN SECULAR 
ONES. 
- 
- 
15.  WHILE THE FAYSAL BANK HIRES ONLY MUSLIMS, 
(86 ALEXANDRIA 1215), THIS IS NOT TRUE OF SOME 
OF THE COMPANIES.  A GOOD CHRISTIAN SOURCE TOLD 
US RECENTLY THAT HE HAS FRIENDS WHO WORK IN ONE 
OF THE AL-ANDALUS COMPANIES.  MANY ARE DESIRABLE, 
HE SAID, BECAUSE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF FOREIGN 
LANGUAGES. 
- 
- 
ISLAMIC WELFARE ASSOCIATIONS IN ALEXANDRIA 
------------------------------------------ 
16.  EMBASSY REPORTING 986 CAIRO 28338) HAS 
DETAILED THE IMPORTANT ROLE PRIVATE WELFARE 
ASSOCIATIONS ROLE PLAY AS A SAFETY NET AND AS A 
STABILIZING FORCE IN A CHANGING SOCIETY.  SIMILAR 
ORGANIZATIONS PROSPER IN ALEXANDRIA, AND MANY OF 
THEM ARE SPONSORED BY THE ISLAMIC RIGHT.  SOME 
OF THESE, LIKE THE \"FAJR AL-ISLAM\" AND \"ASR-AL-ISLAM\" 
CLINICS MENTIONED IN REF B ARE AFFILIATED TO 
RADICAL MOSQUES (COMMENT: THE \"FAJR AL-ISLAM\" 
CHARITABLE SOCIETY WAS THE ONLY ISLAMIC CHARITABLE 
SOCIETY IN ALEXANDRIA BANNED BY THE GOE IN THE 
1981 CRACKDOWN.  THE BAN WAS SUBSEQUENTLY LIFTED. 
END COMMENT.) 
- 
- 
17.  MORE COMMONLY, HOWEVER, THE ISLAMIC RIGHT 
SPONSORS MODERATE CHARITY AND WELFARE ACTIVITIES 
WITH FEW OR NO POLITICO-RELIGIOUS TRAPPINGS. 
ALEXANDRIA PHYSICIANS ARE PARTICULARLY ACTIVE 
IN ESTABLISHING POLYCLINCS.  THEY SOLICIT 
PRIVATE DONATIONS FROM MOSQUES, BUY THEIR 
EQUIPMENT, AND STAFF THEIR CLINICS WITHOUT 
ASSISTANCE FROM THE MINISTRIES OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS 
OR HEALTH.  OFTEN, PHYSICIANS FROM THE UNIVERSITY 
DONATE THEIR TIME IN THE AFTERNOONS.  HOSTELS FOR 
NEEDY FEMALE STUDENTS FROM OUTSIDE ALEXANDRIA, 
AS WELL AS DAY CARE AND OLD-AGE CENTERS, ARE OTHER 
TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SUPPORTED BY WELL-TO-DO 
DEVOUT MUSLIMS.  BECAUSE THE GOE IS UNABLE TO 
PROVIDE ADEQUATE FACILITIES FOR THESE VERY 
NECESSARY ACTIVITIES, ISLAMIC SOCIAL WELFARE 
ASSOCIATIONS OF THIS NATURE FULFILL A STABILIZING 
SOCIAL FUNCTION. 
- 
- 
PHILANTHROPY FROM THE ISLAMIC RIGHT 
----------------------------------- 
18.  MANY OF THE PROMINENT OWNERS OF ISLAMIC 
COMPANIES, SUCH AS MOHAMMED RAGAB, MUSTAFA AL-NAGGAR, 
AND DR. ALI MAHELBA, ARE ALSO WELL KNOWN 
PHILANTHROPISTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, RAGAB AND AL-NAGGAR 
HAVE CONTRIBUTED LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO A NEW 
DRUG REHABILITATION HOSPITAL IN MONTAZA; 
AL-NAGGAR HAS DONATED VERY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT 
TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ALEXANDRIA HOSPITAL; AND 
DR. MAHELBA TOLD US VERY RECENTLY THAT HE IS SETTING 
UP A PROJECT TO SUPPLY FOOD TO THE POOR BY GETTING 
WEALTHY PEOPLE TO DONATE PROVISIONS. THE PROJECT HAS 
BEEN WORKED OUT ON PAPER; HE NOW SEEKING SOMEONE 
TO ADMINISTER IT.  THIS LIST OF PHILANTHROPIC 
ACTIVITIES IS A LONG ONE AND AN IMPORTANT 
(AND IN SOME CASES, VITAL) SOURCE OF SUPPORT TO 
BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HOSPITALS, CLINICS, 
ORPHANAGES, AND SPECIALIZED WELFARE INSTITUTIONS. 
WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF USAID, \"ISLAMIC\" 
BUSINESSMEN ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT BENEFACTORS 
OF PRIVATE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS (ISLAMIC OR 
OTHERWISE) IN ALEXANDRIA AT THE PRESENT TIME. 
- 
- 
19.  CONCLUDING COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH THE ECONOMIC 
SQUEEZE DEPICTED IN 86 ALEXANDRIA 1301 HAS EASED 
SOMEWHAT, INCREASED NUMBERS OF UNEMPLOYED AND RISING 
PRICES CONTINUE TO BE A SERIOUS POTENTIAL PROBLEM 
IN ALEXANDRIA, AS ELSEWHERE.  THE LOCAL GOVERNMNET 
IS TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE MANY INFRASTRUCTURAL 
INADEQUACIES AND GENERAL UNCLEANLINESS WHICH 
PLAGUE ALEXANDRIA, BUT THE PROBLEMS THE GOVERNORATE 
FACES CLEARLY OUTNUMBER THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES 
IT HAS AVAILABLE TO CORRECT THEM OR AT LEAST 
BRING THEM UNDER CONTROL. 
- 
- 
20.  IN THIS SENSE, THE EXPANDING ISLAMIC 
PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES ARE A CONSTRUCTIVE 
FORCE, PROVIDING JOBS AND CONTRIBUTING GENEROUSLY 
TO VITALLY NEEDED SOCIAL SERVICES THROUGH A WIDE 
RANGING COMMITMENT TO WELFARE AND PHILANTHROPIC 
ACTIVITIES.  THUS, WHILE IT HAS BECOME FASHIONABLE 
IN SOME QUARTERS TO VIEW THE ISLAMIC RIGHT 
SOLELY IN TERMS OF A THREAT TO EGYPTIAN STABILITY, 
IN SOME RESPECTS, MODERATE ISLAMIC PROPONENTS 
MIGHT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO EGYPT\'S STABILITY, 
PROVIDED THE ECONOMY DOES NOT FURTHER DETERIORATE 
AND RADICALIZE KEY SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. 
IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN, EXTREMIST LEADERS FROM 
THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, WHO IN ALEXANDRIA HAVE ADOPTED 
A LOW PROFILE, COULD VERY WELL TRY TO EXPLOIT 
A TROUBLED SITUATION AND SEIZE THE INITIATIVE 
FROM THE NAGGARS, THE RAGABS, AND THEIR ILK 
WHO, DESPITE THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SOME 
NON-VIOLENT RADICAL ELEMENTS, SEEM DEDICATED ONLY 
TO SLOW, EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN EGYPT.  END 
CONCLUDING COMMENT.

2.  SUMMARY 
----------- 
 
LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, EGYPT\'S SECOND CITY 
ENTERED INTO RAMADAN ON MARCH 28 AND THE RESULTANT 
REORIENTATION OF THE DAILY WORK AND LIVING ROUTINES TO 
ACCOMODATE DAY-TIME FASTING AND NOCTURNAL FEASTING AND 
FESTIVENESS.  THE OVERALL MOOD  IS OF AN EXTENDED 
NOCTURNAL HOLIDAY SEASON, AND A PARTICULARLY INTENSE 
SOCIAL LIFE.  IT IS QUALIFIED, HOWEVER, BY A SHARPER 
SQUEEZE THIS YEAR THAN IN PAST YEARS RESULTING FROM 
DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF FOOD STAPLES EXCEPT AT MUCH 
HIGHER BLACK MARKET PRICES, OFTEN DOUBLE THE USUAL RATES. 
WHILE OUR CONTACTS COMMONLY ESTIMATE THAT NO MORE THAN 
60 PERCENT OF ALEXANDRIANS COMPLY FULLY WITH RELIGIOUSLY 
PRESCRIBED ABSTINANCE, E.G., FROM FOOD, DRINK AND 
NICOTINE  DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS, PROBABLY 80-90 PERCENT 
OF THE POPULACE ARE CAREFUL TO OBSERVE THESE STRICTURES 
IN PUBLIC.  THERE IS A CLEAR SENSE OF HEIGHTENING SOCIAL 
PRESSURE TO CONFORM WITH THE PUBLIC REPEAT PUBLIC 
NORMS OF BEHAVIOR, CONSISTENT WITH AN OVERALL CONTEXT 
OF SLOW BUT SURELY CONTINUING TREND OF ISLAMIC RELIGIOSITY. 
ATTENTION TO AND DISCUSSION OF POLITICAL ISSUES SEEMS TO 
HAVE SLACKENED WITH THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION OF INCREASING 
FOCUS AMONG THE POLITICALLY LITERATE ON ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN 
ISSUES, NOTABLYSOVIETJEWISH IMMIGRATION.  END SUMMARY. 
-- 
 
3.  DAY INTO NIGHT 
------------------ 
 
WITH A MOSLEM MAJORITY OF PERHAPS 85 PERCENT OF ITS 
ROUGHLY 5 MILLION INHABITANTS, ALEXANDRIA ON MARCH 28 
ENTERED THE LUNAR MONTH-LONG PERIOD OF RAMADAN AND RE- 
ORIENTED MUCH OF ROUTINE ACTIVITY FROM DAY TO NIGHT. 
ABOUT A WEEK LATER, THE COPTIC CHRISTIANS WHO MAKE UP 
MOST OF THE REMAINDER ENTERED INTO THEIR OBSERVANCE OF 
LENTEN FASTING.  WITH NOCTURNAL FEASTING BEGINNING AT THE 
CRACK OF CANNONS AND CALLS TO PRAYER SIGNALLING SUNDOWN 
FOLLOWED BY NIGHT TIME PROMENADES, CALLS ON FRIENDS AND 
FAMILY AND SORTIES TO OPEN-AIR CARNIVALS, MOST ALEXANDRIANS 
DO NOT GET TO BED BEFORE ONE OR TWO IN THE MORNING.  THEY 
THEN WAKE FOR A PRE-DAWN BREAKFAST.  AS A RESULT, THE 
WORK DAY COMMONLY DOES NOT BEGIN BEFORE TEN OR ELEVEN 
IN THE MORNING AND LASTS ONLY UNTIL 2:30 OR 4:00 IN 
THE AFTERNOON, ALTHOUGH STORES AND SERVICE SHOPS GEN- 
ERALLY REOPEN AT 7:30 FOR BUSINESS UNTIL 11:00 OR EVEN 
LATER.  BY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, THE PRESCRIBED AB- 
STINENCE FROM FOOD, DRINK, AND CIGARETTES HAS LOWERED 
THE COLLECTIVE ENERGY LEVEL PERCEPTIBLY AND, NOTABLY 
AMONG MOTORISTS ANXIOUS TO GET HOME FOR A QUICK NAP 
BEFORE ANOTHER HEAVY NOCTURNAL SCHEDULE, TEMPERS HAVE 
BEEN SHARPENED. 
 
4.  CONTACTS EXPLAIN TO THIS OBSERVOR EXPERIENCING 
HIS FIRST RAMADAN IN EGYPT, THAT PERHAPS 85 OR 90 
PERCENT OF MOSLEMS ARE CAREFUL TO OBSERVE PUBLICALLY 
REPEAT PUBLICALLY THE NORMS OF DAY TIME ABSTINENCE, BUT 
THAT PROBABLY 20-30 PERCENT CANNOT RESIST THE 
TEMPTATION TO SNEAK A CIGARETTE OR A FURTIVE COFFEE OR 
SOFT DRINK AND, PERHAPS, EVEN A SNACK.  THE FEW MAJOR 
TOURIST HOTELS SELL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ONLY TO FOREIGNERS 
AND THEN ONLY FROM 5:30 OR 6:00 IN THE EVENING UNTIL 
MIDNIGHT IN CAREFULLY LIMITED AREAS.  BY COMMON CON- 
SENSUS, EVEN THE MINORITY OF MOSLEMS WHO REGULARLY IN- 
BIBE A WHISKEY OR GIN AND TONIC AT FESTIVE OCCASIONS 
DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR, ARE CAREFUL TO ABSTAIN 
PUBLICALLY AND TOTALLY NOW.  THAT SAID, PIETY IS PRACTICAL 
ECONOMIC SENSE FOR THE TYPICAL LOW INCOME ALEXANDRIAN. 
THE LATTER\'S SALARY IS ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT OF US100 
DOLLARS MONTHLY.  BEER AND LIQUOR ARE WELL BEYOND HIS 
PRICE RANGE -- AT ANYWHERE FROM THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE 
DOLLAR TO THREE DOLLARS PER LIBATION -- SO OBLIGATORY 
TEMPERANCE DURING RAMADAN REPRESENTS VIRTUALLY NO 
CHANGE FROM HIS USUAL LIFE STYLE YEAR-ROUND.  DAILY 
PRAYING IS, WE ARE TOLD, MARKEDLY MORE FREQUENT. 
OVERALL, THERE IS A SENSE OF A CONTINUED, GRADUAL 
TIGHTENING OF SOCIAL PRESSURES TO OBSERVE ISLAMIC NORMS 
IN KEEPING WITH A YEAR-ROUND TREND OF INCREASING RELI- 
GIOSITY IN OUTWARD DRESS AND BEHAVIOR. 
 
5.  FOOD:  AVAILABILITY AND PRICE SQUEEZE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
THE GENERALLY FESTIVE NOCTURNAL HOLIDAY ATMOSPHERE HAS 
BEEN QUALIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY BY A FOOD AVAILABILITY 
AND PRICE SQUEEZE WHICH IS PERCEPTIBLY SHARPER THIS YEAR 
THAN PREVIOUSLY.  ALEXANDRIANS INSIST THAT THEY PROBABLY 
CONSUME AS MUCH OR MORE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF FOODS DURING 
THIS LUNAR  MONTH THAN THEY DO IN THE REMAINING 11 MONTHS 
OF THE YEAR COMBINED.  NOTABLY, HUGE AMOUNTS OF SYRUPY 
AND OTHER HIGHLY SWEETENED CAKES, PASTRIES AND OTHER 
RICH DESSERT GOODIES.  FURTHER, IN A CULTURE NOTABLE 
FOR COMPULSIVE HOSPITALITY, RAMADAN BRINGS THAT IMPULSE 
TO A FEVERISH PEAK.  THUS, BY DISTORTING ANNUAL 
BUDGETS AND/OR BORROWING, MOST ALEXANDRIANS SPEND AS 
MUCH OR MORE THAN THEY CAN POSSIBLY AFFORD TO OBSERVE 
A DAILY PRACTICE OF LAVISH HOSPITALITY. 
 
6.  FLOUR, SUGAR, COOKING OIL AND RICE, IN THAT DESCEND- 
ING ORDER OR PRIORITY, HAVE BEEN NOTICEABLY SCARCE SINCE 
THE SECOND WEEK OF MARCH.  AVAILABILITY OF THESE STAPLES 
IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO BLACK MARKET SOURCES WHO 
DEMAND AND GET TWO AND THREE TIMES THE NORMAL PRICES. 
(E.G., FLOUR, SUGAR AND RICE ARE SELLING AT DOUBLE THE 
USUAL  PRICE, WHILE THE BETTER QUALITY OF COOKING OIL 
HAS SOARED OUT OF THE REACH OF MANY CONSUMERS.)  PUSHING 
AND SHOVING AT GOVERNMENT-OWNED OUTLETS BY POORER 
ALEXANDRIANS EAGER TO GET THEIR RATIONS OF THE ABOVE 
STAPLES HAS BECOME MORE INTENSE.  HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN 
NO REPEAT OF A TRAGIC INCIDENT IN THE DELTA TOWN OF KAFR 
DAWAR WHERE ON MARCH 26 FOUR WOMEN REPORTEDLY 
WERE CRUSHED TO DEATH IN A MOB LINED UP OUTSIDE 
A DISTRIBUTION OUTLET.  NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS 
RESENTFUL GOSSIP ABOUT GOVERNMENT OUTLET EMPLOYEES 
AND PRIVATE GROCERS LICENSED TO SELL GOVERNMENT- 
SUPPLIED COMMODITIES.  THOSE ADVANTAGEOUSLY PLACED 
ARE PROFITING HANDSOMELY FROM SALES OF GOVERNMENT 
STOCKS TO AFFLUENT INDIVIDUALS OR CORPORATE BUYERS 
LIKE RESTAURANTS OR HOTELS.  FURTHER, FRESH VEGETABLES 
HAVE JUMPED 30 PERCENT OR MORE OVER THEIR USUAL 
PRICE LEVELS.  LOCAL POLICE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CRACK 
DOWN ON MERCHANTS GUILTY OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS PRICE- 
GOUGING BUT TO LITTLE EFFECT IN ELIMINATING IT AS 
A PREVALING PRACTICE. 
 
7.  ON BALANCE, HOWEVER, THE STRIKING EGYPTIAN 
TRAIT OF SOMEHOW MAKING DO HAS ASSERTED ITSELF 
AND THE MOOD ON THE STREETS -- BASED ON OUR SIDEWALK 
SORTIES APRIL 4 AND APRIL 9 AT NIGHT INTO THE CENTRAL 
ALEXANDRIA AREA -- IS GENERALLY RELAXED.  BARRING 
ANY FURTHER OR SUDDEN REDUCTION IN THE AVIALABILITY 
OF FOOD, THERE IS NO DISCERNIBLE INDICATION OF ANYTHING 
THAT MIGHT SPARK PUBLIC UNREST. 
 
8.  NEVERTHELESS, WE NOTE AMONG THETPOLITICALLY 
LITERATE CLUSTERS OF ELITE OPINION AN INCREASING 
CRITICAL INTEREST IN U.S. POLICIES ON THE ISSUES OF 
SOVIET JEWISH IMMIGRATION TO ISRAEL AND, MOST RECENTLY, 
THE STATUS OF JERUSALEM.  INDEED, AT A SUNDOWN DINNER 
\"IFTAR\" OF THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON APRIL 4, HOSTED 
BY THE LOCAL EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION 
IN HIS HONOR, AMBASSADOR WISNER WAS ASKED, WITH 
IMPECCABLE COURTESY IN AN EXTREMELY ORDIAL 
SETTING, TO \"EXPLAIN\" THE U.S. POSITION. WARMLY 
APPLUADED FOR BOTH HIS PREPARED REMARKS AND THE Q AND 
A SESSION THAT FOLLOWED DURING THE AMBASSADOR\'S 
HOUR-AND-A-QUARTER SESSION, WE NOTE THAT PRIVATE 
REMARKS TO US LATER FOCUSSED ON THE AMBASSADOR\'S 
ELOQUENCE BUT THAT CONCERNS ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE 
IMMIGRATION QUESTION REMAIN UNABATED.  INTERESTINGLY, 
WE SINCE HAVE HEARD FROM BUSINESS COMMUNITY CONTACTS 
THE APPREHENSIVE REASONING THAT GIVEN THE PRESUMED 
TERRITORIAL INABILITY OF BOTH ISRAEL PROPER AND 
THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES LITERALLY TO ACCOMODATE 
SOVIET JEWS, THE ISRAELIS ULITMATELY WILL BE OBLIGED 
TO \"RE-TAKE\" THE SINAI LANDS CEDED TO EGYPT.  INDEED, 
AS THE COLLECTIVE ATTENTION OF ALEXANDRIANS FOCUSES 
LITERALLY ON INGESTION AND DIGESTION, INTEREST 
IN POLITICAL ISSUES AMONG OUR RANGE OF USUAL 
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL CIRCLE CONTACTS HAS 
SLACKENED.

SUBJECT: ALEXANDRIA: CONSENSUS OF VIEWS ON 
         THE PROBLEMS FACING EGYPT: THE ECONOMY 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  DURING A DAY-LONG SERIES OF 
MEETINGS OCTOBER 17, CG SCHELL AND VISITING NEA/EGY 
DIRECTOR SURBER HEARD FROM A CROSS-SECTION OF OUR 
REGULAR LOCAL CONTACTS THAT THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM 
FACING EGYPT TODAY IS THE ECONOMY, MORE SPECIFICALLY, 
THE LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES.  OUR CONTACTS WERE 
ALMOST UNANIMOUS IN THEIR VIEWS THAT ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST MILITANCY DERIVES MUCH OF ITS MOMENTUM 
FROM THE FRUSTRATIONS AND HOPELESSNESS WHICH ATTEND THE 
CURRENT SITUATION.  THEY ALL RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO 
CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF ECONOMIC REFORM AND TO CREATE 
JOBS AND A FUTURE FOR EGYPTIANS.  COMMENT: THOUGH NOT 
NEW,  THEIR MESSAGE WAS NONETHELESS REMARKABLE FOR ITS 
UNIFORMITY.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
3.  THE ALEXANDRIANS WHO MET WITH NEA/EGY DIRECTOR 
SURBER AND CG SCHELL OCTOBER 17 REPRESENTED A 
CROSS-SECTION OF OUR LOCAL CONTACTS.  THEY INCLUDED THE 
MAYOR OF ONE OF ALEXANDRIAS SIX DISTRICTS, THE DIRECTOR 
OF AN A.I.D.-FUNDED SMALL BUSINESS PROJECT, SEVERAL 
YOUNG AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN, A MEMBER OF THE SHOURA 
COUNCIL, AND A MEMBER OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, WHO IS 
ALSO AN ACADEMIC. 
 
4.  A CONSENSUS EMERGED FROM THE SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL 
MEETINGS WE HELD; NAMELY THAT THE ECONOMY IS THE MOST 
SERIOUS PROBLEM FACING EGYPT TODAY AND, SPECIFICALLY, 
THAT THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO ADDRESS THE 
UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM AND INCREASE THE ROLE OF THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR.  THE DISTRICT MAYOR, A HARD-WORKING 
PUBLIC SERVANT HEAVILY-INVOLVED IN LOCAL PUBLIC WORKS 
PROJECTS, STATED FLATLY THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM 
WAS BEYOND HIS LOCAL RESOURCES.  THE A.I.D. PROJECT 
ADMINISTRATOR, WHOSE PROJECT PROVIDES LOANS FOR SMALL 
BUSINESSES, SAID THAT EVERY 1,690 L.E. (APPROX. USD 510) 
HE LOANS CREATES ONE NEW JOB.  HE WAS AN AGGRESSIVE 
ADVOCATE OF JOB-CREATION AND THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR IN RESTORING THE AILING ECONOMY.  HIS VIEWS WERE 
ECHOED BY THE YOUNG BUSINESSMEN AND BY THE SHOURA 
COUNCIL MEMBER, WHO ARGUED FOR EXPANSION OF THE 
A.I.D.-FUNDED PROGRAM AND TOLD US THAT THE MAIN 
CHALLENGE OF HIS COUNCIL WAS TO \"CONTINUE THE PROCESS 
(ECONOMIC REFORM) WHICH WE HAVE STARTED.\"  FINALLY, THE 
PEOPLES ASSEMBLY MEMBER STRESSED THAT ECONOMIC REFORM 
WAS NOT JUST A MATTER OF GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION AND 
REDUCTION OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR.  HE NOTED THAT THE 
BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAD TO BE READY INVOLVE ITSELF IN 
OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR. 
 
5.  OUR CONTACTS ALSO AGREED THAT EGYPTS ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS, WITH THEIR ATTENDENT FRUSTRATION AND 
HOPELESSNESS, WERE BEHIND THE RISE IN FUNDAMENTALIST 
MILITANCY AND VIOLENCE.  THEY NOTED THAT THE 
FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT INCLUDED A SOCIAL WELFARE 
COMPONENT WHICH AIDES YOUNG EGYPTIANS IN THE PURCHASE OF 
TEXTBOOKS AND IN THE QUEST FOR HOUSING, THUS APPEARING 
MORE RESPONSIVE TO PEOPLES NEEDS THAN THE GOVERNMENT. 
THE ONLY POSSIBLY DIFFERING VIEW WAS THAT OF THE 
UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATOR WHO, WHILE IN AGREEMENT ABOUT 
THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, ARGUED THAT EXCESSIVE 
FORCE AND OVERREACTION BY SECURITY FORCES HAD ALSO 
CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED FUNDAMENTALIST POPULARITY AND 
MILITANCY. (HER VIEWS ARE REPORTED SEPTEL). 
 
6.  COMMENT: ALTHOUGH OUR CONTACTS CAME FROM A VARIETY 
OF BACKGROUNDS AND OUTLOOKS, THE SIMILARITIES IN THEIR 
ANALYSES AND CONCLUSIONS WERE STRIKING.  NO ONE ARGUED 
WITH THE BASIC PREMIS OF THE NECESSITY OF ECONOMIC 
REFORM, NOR WITH THE PACE OF REFORM, YET ALL RECOGNIZED 
THE POLITICAL DANGERS THE PROCESS OF REFORM COULD 
BRING.  THEIR COMMENTS ON FUNDAMENTALISM WERE ALSO 
REMARKABLY SIMILAR.  END COMMENT. 
 
7.  NEA/EGY SURBER DID NOT REVIEW OR CLEAR ON THE TEXT 
OF THIS MESSAGE.

REF:  (A) ALEXANDRIA 541 (B) ALEXANDRIA 341 
-     (C) ALEXANDRIA 43 (D) ALEXANDRIA 38 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE TRIAL OF THIRTY-ONE SUSPECTED 
ISLAMIC JIHAD MEMBERS, SOME OF WHOM WERE ARRESTED IN 
ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST, WILL BEGIN OCTOBER 29 AT 
ALEXANDRIAS HIGH MILITARY COURT ACCORDING TO WIDESPREAD 
PRESS COVERAGE.  THE SUSPECTED MILITANTS, WHO COULD FACE 
THE DEATH PENALTY IF FOUND GUILTY OF THE CHARGES OF 
SUBVERSION AND PLOTTING ASSASSINATIONS, WILL BE THE 
FIRST LARGE GROUP TO STAND TRIAL UNDER EGYPTS NEW 
ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS.  LOCAL SECURITY SOURCES DESCRIBED 
THE BOMBINGS OF ALCOHOL SHOPS IN ALEXANDRIA LAST WINTER 
AS \"KIDS STUFF\" COMPARED TO WHAT WAS BEING PLANNED BY 
THE SUSPECTED JIHAD MEMBERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) THE TRIAL OF THIRTY-ONE SUSPECTED ISLAMIC JIHAD 
MEMBERS WILL BEGIN OCTOBER 29 AT ALEXANDRIAS HIGH 
MILITARY COURT ACCORDING TO FRONT PAGE COVERAGE IN ALL 
OFFICIAL PAPERS AND TELEVISION NEWS BROADCASTS.  THE 
SUSPECTED MILITANTS, WHO COULD FACE THE DEATH PENALTY IF 
FOUND GUILTY OF THE CHARGES OF SUBVERSION AND PLOTTING 
ASSASSINATIONS, WILL BE THE FIRST LARGE GROUP TO STAND 
TRIAL UNDER EGYPTS NEW ANTI-TERRORISM LAW PASSED IN 
JULY.  GENERAL ABDEL GAFFAR HELAL, DIRECTOR OF THE 
MILITARY COURT SYSTEM, ANNOUNCED THAT THE SUSPECTS, SOME 
OF WHOM HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST, WERE 
FROM TWO JIHAD SPLINTER GROUPS WHICH HAD BEEN PLANNING 
ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS 
FIGURES, IMPORTANT GOE INSTALLATIONS AND TOURIST SITES 
IN EGYPT.  SOME OF THE MEMBERS REPORTEDLY HAD RECEIVED 
MILITARY TRAINING IN OTHER COUNTRIES (I.E. 
AFGHANISTAN).  THOSE ARRESTED INCLUDED A FEW FOREIGNERS 
(JORDANIAN, SUDANESE) AND EGYPTIANS FROM FAYOUM, MINYA, 
ALEXANDRIA, MANSOURA, CAIRO, SOHAG, KAFR EL SHEIKH, AND 
LUXOR. 
 
3. (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, THE FIRST JIHAD 
SPLINTER GROUP TRAINED MEMBERS OUTSIDE OF EGYPT AND SENT 
THEM BACK TO EGYPT (VIA LIBYA AND SUDAN) WITH MONEY AND 
WEAPONS TO COMMIT ACTS OF SABOTAGE.  FIFTEEN MEMBERS OF 
THIS GROUP WERE ARRESTED AND NINE OTHERS FLED.  POLICE 
FOUND ARMS, EXPLOSIVES, FRAUDULENT IDENTIFICATION CARDS 
AND PASSPORTS, AND MONEY AT THE TIME OF THE ARREST.  THE 
SECOND GROUP, \"GAMAAT EL-TAKFEER,\" HAS ORGANIZED TO 
DISCREDIT EGYPTS RULING REGIME AND PEOPLE AS 
\"NON-BELIEVERS.\"  THIS GROUP REPORTEDLY HAS PLANNING TO 
ASSASSINATE GOE OFFICIALS (INCLUDING POLICE) AND DESTROY 
INSTALLATIONS (INCLUDING SOME MOSQUES) AS INDICATED ON 
PLANS AND A MAP FOUND AT THE TIME OF THE ARREST OF 
SIXTEEN OF THE GROUPS TWENTY-TWO MEMBERS. 
 
4. (U) GOE OFFICIALS ON THE HIT LIST REPORTEDLY 
INCLUDED:  DR. SAFWAT EL-SHERIF, MINISTER OF 
INFORMATION; MINISTER OF INTERIOR ABDEL HALIM MOUSSA; 
GENERAL MUSTAFA KAMEL, GOVERNOR OF DAKAHLIA AND FORMER 
HEAD OF STATE SECURITY; MOHAMED HASSAN TANTAWI, GOVERNOR 
OF SOHAG; AND OTHER FORMER MINISTERS OF INTERIOR. 
 
5. (U) GENERAL ABDUL GAFFAR HELAL ALSO SAID THAT THE 
TRIAL WILL TAKE PLACE IN ALEXANDRIA BECAUSE THAT IS 
WHERE MOST OF THE GROUPS ACTIVITIES WERE CENTERED. 
STATE SECURITY REPORTEDLY HAD TRACKED SOME OF THE 
MEMBERS MOVEMENT TO ALEXANDRIA FROM UPPER EGYPT 
FOLLOWING DISTURBANCES THERE LAST SPRING.  THE 
INVESTIGATION ALSO REPORTEDLY REVEALED THAT THE MEMBERS 
USED TO HOLD MEETINGS AT THE IBRAHIM MOSQUE OF SHEIKH 
AHMED EL-MEHALLAWY AT RAMLEH STATION (DOWNTOWN 
ALEXANDRIA) AND THAT THEY BELONG TO AN INTERNATIONAL 
FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT LED BY OMAR ABDURRAHMAN, RASHED 
GHANOUSHI OF TUNISIA, ABBAS MIDANI OF ALGERIA, AND 
HASSAN EL-TURABI OF SUDAN. 
 
6. (C) LOCAL SECURITY CONTACTS CONFIRMED THE PRESS 
ACCOUNTS AND ADDED MORE DETAILS.  THOSE A 
RRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST (REF A) APPARENTLY CAME 
HERE FLEEING FROM THE SECURITY CRACKDOWN IN UPPER EGYPT 
LAST SPRING.  THEY MAY ALSO HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEIR 
NEW LOCATION TO ASSIST THE LOCAL JIHAD ORGANIZATION IN 
CARRYING OUT SOME OF THE ALEXANDRIA INCIDENTS REPORTED 
PREVIOUSLY.  ACCORDING TO OUR SECURITY CONTACTS, THE TWO 
JIHAD SPLINTER GROUPS PLANS WERE HIGHLY 
COMPARTMENTALIZED AND THE MEMBERS GENERALLY DID NOT KNOW 
EACHOTHER, BOTH FOR THEIR PROTECTION AND THE SUCCESS OF 
THEIR OPERATIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THOSE ARRESTED 
ARE REPORTEDLY IDEOLOGICALLY-MOTIVATED, WELL-EDUCATED 
PROFESSIONALS, NOT JUST UNSKILLED LABORERS ATTRACTED TO 
FUNDAMENTALISM FOR ECONOMIC REASONS, AS CONVEYED BY 
PRESS COVERAGE. 
 
7. (C) SECURITY CONTACTS INDICATED THAT THE BOMBINGS OF 
ALCOHOL SHOPS IN ALEXANDRIA LAST WINTER (REFS B-D) WERE 
\"KIDS STUFF\" COMPARED TO WHAT WAS BEING PLANNED.  STATE 
SECURITY OFFICIALS TOLD US THAT JIHAD MEMBERS WHO THE 
PRESS REPORTED HAD \"ESCAPED\" SIMPLY HAD NOT BEEN 
APESTED YET; THEY ARE BELIEVED TO BE OUTSIDE OF EGYPT 
AT THIS TIME. 
- 
8. (C)  OTHER SECURITY SOURCES RECENTLY PROVIDED 
ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE INDICATING THE RISING LEVEL OF 
POLICE CONCERN IN ALEXANDRIA AND NEIGHBORING 
GOVERNORATES.  SEVERAL GOE OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY HAVE 
BEEN PLACED UNDER HEAVY PERSONAL SECURITY DUE TO THE 
UNCOVERING OF SPECIFIC PLOTS AGAINST THEM, INCLUDING THE 
GOVERNOR OF DAKAHLIA, GENERAL MUSTAFA KAMEL, THE 
GOVERNOR OF GHARBIA, MAHER EL GUENDY, AND ALEXANDRIA 
STATE SECURITYS HEAD OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS.  KAMEL, 
FORMER HEAD OF STATE SECURITY, AND EL GUENDY, WHO 
INTERROGATED FUNDAMENTALISTS DURING SADATS TIME, HAVE 
REPUTATIONS OF HAVING BEEN VERY TOUGH ON EXTREMISTS. 
 
9. (C) COMMENT: THIS TRIAL OF SUSPECTED JIHAD MEMBERS IS 
SIGNIFICANT, BOTH BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO TAKE 
PLACE IN A MILITARY COURT UNDER THE ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS 
PASSED THIS SUMMER AND BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE 
OFFENSES.  OUR STATE SECURITY CONTACTS, WHO IN THE PAST 
HAVE RESPONDED TO OUR INQUIRIES ABOUT FUNDAMENTALIST 
ACTIVITIES IN A LOW KEY AND RELAXED MANNER, READILY 
CONFIRMED PRESS REPORTS AND VOLUNTEERED ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION ON THIS CASE.  THE NEWLY REVEALED DETAILS 
ABOUT THE SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST 
CERTAINLY PUT INTO A MORE SERIOUS LIGHT THE LOCAL 
INCIDENTS REPORTED REFTELS.  AS TO WHY THE GOE HAS 
DECIDED TO START THE TRIAL NOW, AS SUGGESTED BY THE 
EXTENSIVE PRESS COVERAGE, THE GOE SEEMS TO BE ANXIOUS TO 
COUNTER THE NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND EFFECTS OF THE RECENT 
ATTACKS ON TOURISTS AND TO DETER EXTREMISTS FROM 
COMMITTING FURTHER VIOLENCE.  END COMMENT.

REF: (A) ALEXANDRIA 22  (B) FBIS NC0901165293 
 
 
1.  OFFICIALS OF THE MERSA MATROUH GOVERNORATE HAVE 
CONFIRMED LOCAL PRESS REPORTS THAT THE SALLOUM BORDER 
CROSSING WAS REOPENED BY LIBYAN AUTHORITIES EARLY 
TUESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 12.  LIBYA HAD CLOSED ITS LAND 
BORDERS FOR A THREE-DAY PERIOD TO PROTEST THE 
U.N.-IMPOSED SANCTIONS (COMMENT: THERE ARE A FEW RUMORS 
HERE, PROBABLY GROUNDLESS, THAT THE GOL CLOSED THE 
BORDERS WHILE SEARCHING FOR SUSPECTS INVOLVED IN THE CA 
ACCIDENT WHICH KILLED THE GOL JUSTICE MINISTER. END 
COMMENT).  OVER 150 VEHICLES HAVE REPORTEDLY CROSSED AT 
SALLOUM SINCE THE BORDER WAS REOPENED.  THE GOVERNOR 0 
MERSA MATROUH HAS BEEN AT THE BORDER OVERSEEING THE 
COMMITMENT OF ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES 
TO HANDLE A HEAVY TRAFFIC BACKLOG. 
 
2.  NOT A FEW EGYPTIANS WERE INCONVENIENCED AND ANGERE 
BY LIBYAS ACTIONS.  AS ONE EXAMPLE, EXPATRIATE TEACHE 
WORKING IN LIBYA LOST THREE DAYS OF THEIR MID-TERM 
HOLIDAY WHEN THEY WERE STRANDED.  THE PRESS REPORTS TH 
LOSSES TO EGYPTIAN BUSINESSES FROM THE EMBARGO TOTALLE 
20 MILLION L.E. (ABOUT USD 600,000), INCLUDING MUCH 
SPOILED PRODUCE.  COMMENT: WHILE THIS SEEMS HIGH TO US 
WE DO NOTE PRIOR REPORTS (REF A) OF THE MAGNITUDE OF T 
TRAFFIC BACKLOG AND THAT MERCHANTS DELAYED AT SALLOUM 
WERE SELLING THEIR PRODUCE AT VERY REDUCED PRICES. 
WHATEVER THE DAMAGES, THE GOL WON NO FRIENDS HERE WITH 
ITS EMBARGO AND, IN FACT, PROBABLY LEFT LIBYAS OWN 
BUSINESS COMMUNITY HURT AND ANGRY.  OUR LOCAL CONTACTS 
FLATLY CALL THE EMBARGO ECONOMIC \"SUICIDE\" FOR LIBYA.

BREAKING INTO A MOSQUE IN THE GHARBIA GOVERNORATE

HEARING OUR FIRST REPORTS OF EGYPTIANS OBJECTING TO

END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
THE ALEXANDRIA ARRESTS 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  FORTY EIGHT PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED IN ALEXANDRIA ON 
MARCH 8.  ALTHOUGH SOME WEAPONS WERE FOUND THERE WERE 
NONE OF THE CLASHES THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILAR 
MEASURES ELSEWHERE IN EGYPT.  BY CONTRAST, A 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ISLAMIST ANTI-GOVERNMENT 
PRINTED MATERIAL WAS SEIZED. 
 
THERE ARE CONFLICTING STORIES ABOUT WHO AND WHAT 
THOSE ARRESTED ARE.  ONE POLICE OFFICER TOLD US ALL 
THOSE ARRESTED WERE FROM UPPER EGYPT AND THAT SOME 
WERE INVOLVED IN THE KILLING OF THE BRITISH TOURIST 
LAST OCTOBER AND OTHER ATTACKS ON TOURISTS.  OTHER 
POLICE SOURCES INDICATED THAT THOSE ARRESTED WERE 
ACTIVISTS (PLANNERS, ORGANIZERS) AS OPPOSED TO 
TERRORISTS.  THE PRESS REPORTS THAT 11 OF THE 48 
ARRESTED HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED. 
 
4.  THE PRESS CLAIMS THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THOSE 
ARRESTED BELONG TO \"HEZBOLLAH\", BUT THERE IS 
CONFUSION ON THAT SCORE AS WELL.  ONE POLICE SOURCE 
DENIED THAT HEZBOLLAH WAS PRESENT IN ALEXANDRIA AT 
ALL.  ANOTHER SOURCE SAID THE NAME HEZBOLLAH WAS 
ADOPTED BY A SMALL GROUP OF EXTREMISTS WHO HAD 
BROKEN AWAY FROM THEIR MAIN GROUP BECAUSE OF A 
DISPUTE OVER CONTROL AND HAD CHOSEN WHAT THEY 
THOUGHT WAS A CATCHY NAME. 
 
------------------------------- 
MOSQUE TAKE OVER 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  EIGHT MEMBERS OF JIHAD WERE ARRESTED FOR 
BREAKING INTO A MOSQUE, USING CHAINS TO ATTACK THOSE 
SAYING PRAYERS AND ATTEMPTING TO TAKE OVER THE 
MOSQUE FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES.  THE INCIDENT 
OCCURRED IN THE VILLAGE OF SHOUBRA MALAS IN ZEFTA IN 
THE DELTA GOVERNORATE OF GHARBIA.  THERE WAS A CLASH 
BETWEEN THE INTRUDERS AND THE \"CONGREGATION\", BEFORE 
INTRUDERS WERE ARRESTED.  THIS INCIDENT CLOSELY 
RESEMBLES ANOTHER ATTEMPTED TAKE OVER OF A MOSQUE IN 
KAFR EL ZAYAT, ALSO IN GHARBIA, IN AUGUST 1992.  THE 
AUGUST INCIDENT WAS REPORTEDLY PERPETRATED BY 
ACTIVISTS FROM UPPER EGYPT ATTEMPTING TO FORM JIHAD 
CELLS IN THE DELTA. 
- 
6.  THE PRESS ALSO REPORTS A MARCH 17 INCIDENT IN 
TANTA, THE CAPITAL OF GHARBIA GOVERNORATE.  TWENTY 
EIGHT FUNDAMENTALISTS ARE ACCUSED OF ATTACKING A 
SHRINE AND ATTEMPTING TO DIG UP THE COFFIN OF THE 
SAINT TO WHICH IT IS DEDICATED.  ACCORDING TO THE 
FUNDAMENTALISTS, REVERENCE OF SAINTS IS AN 
ABERRATION. 
 
------------------------- 
HEJAB FOR AMERICANS? 
------------------------- 
 
7.  TWO AMERICAN WOMEN RESIDENT IN ALEXANDRIA WERE 
WAVED OUT OF AN ANTIQUE SHOP IN TOWN THIS WEEK 
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE THEIR HEADS COVERED.  AT 
LEAST ONE OF THE WOMEN IS A GRANDMOTHER AND BOTH 
WERE CONSERVATIVELY DRESSED.  BOTH HAVE SHOPPED IN 
THE AREA BEFORE AND NEVER ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM. 
- 
------------------------- 
COMMENT 
------------------------- 
 
8.  TO DATE ALEXANDRIA HAS BEEN SPARED THE VIOLENCE 
ASSOCIATED WITH INCIDENTS IN UPPER EGYPT AND EVEN 
CAIRO.  THERE IS, HOWEVER, A DEFINITE INCREASE IN 
FUNDAMENTALIST ACTIVITY AND, FOR SOME LONGTIME 
RESIDENTS, AN ALMOST PALPABLE CHANGE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. 
AS NOTED, THERE IS SOME CONFUSION AS TO 
WHO IS DOING WHAT IN THE ALEXANDRIA AREA.  GOE 
OFFICIALS JUMP AT ANY CHANCE TO ATTRIBUTE PROBLEMS 
TO FOREIGN INFLUENCES, WHILE ALEXANDRIA OFFICIALS 
JUMP AT ANY CHANCE TO CLAIM THE TROUBLEMAKERS COME 
FROM UPPER EGYPT.  THERE PROBABLY IS SOME EXTERNAL 
INFLUENCE AND THERE MAY BE UPPER EGYPTIANS WHO HAVE 
COME TO ALEXANDRIA TO ESCAPE POLICE ATTENTION AND/OR 
TO ORGANIZE; THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND HERE BEFORE.  BUT, 
EVEN WITHOUT THEM, ECONOMIC DISSATISFACTION AND A 
TREND TOWARD FUNDAMENTALISM HAVE EXISTED FOR SOME 
TIME PRIMARILY AMONG THE POORER ELEMENTS OF 
ALEXANDRIAS POPULATION, EVEN IF THIS HAS NOT YET 
SPURRED THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE SEEN IN UPPER EGYPT 
AND, MOST RECENTLY, IN CAIRO.

TAGS:  PGOV, KISL, EG 
SUBJECT: ALEXANDRIA: IMPROVING THE NEIGHBORHOODS 
         AND (BY) MOVING OUT THE FUNDAMENTALISTS 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA IS UNDERTAKING 
A MAJOR PROGRAM TO IMPROVE HOUSING AND GENERAL LIVING 
CONDITIONS IN MANY OF ITS POORER NEIGHBORHOODS.  ONE 
PROGRAM ELEMENT, INVOLVING THE RELOCATION OF 
NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS, IS IN PART INTENDED TO ROOT 
OUT AND ISOLATE EXTREMISTS AND THEIR FUNDAMENTALIST 
SYMPATHIZERS.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SURVEYING 
NEIGHBORHOODS AND PREPARING LOCAL IMPROVEMENT PLANS 
ALSO SEEK TO IDENTIFY FUNDAMENTALIST TROUBLEMAKERS, 
WHO ARE THEN RELOCATED TO AREAS AWAY FROM THEIR 
LIKE-MINDED FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) THE OFFICIAL PRESS MAY 10 REPORTED THAT THE 
CITY OF ALEXANDRIA WAS ENGAGED IN A 186 MILLION L.E. 
(ABOUT USD 55 MILLION) PROGRAM OF NEIGHBORHOOD 
IMPROVEMENTS.  TARGETTED AT FIFTY-SIX POOR 
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY, THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO 
IMPROVE HOUSING, ROADS, SEWAGE FACILITIES AND WATER 
SUPPLIES. 
 
3. (LOU) A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER AND A DISTRICT MAYOR 
WHOM WE SPOKE WITH SEPARATELY WERE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT 
THE PROGRAM.  BOTH EMPHASIZED THE CARE WHICH THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS TAKING TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS 
OF EACH NEIGHBORHOOD.  THEY CLAIMED THAT SOCIAL 
WORKERS HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH VISITING THE 
NEIGHBORHOODS TO SURVEY THE NEEDS OF LOCAL RESIDENTS 
AND THEN HELP PLAN A SUITABLE PROGRAM.  IN AREAS 
WHERE HOUSING IS COMPLETELY UNSUITABLE, RESIDENTS 
WILL BE PREMANENTLY RELOCATED TO HOUSING ELSEWHERE, 
SUCH AS IN THE NOW-LARGELY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT OF 
AMREYA, NEAR THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY.  WHERE 
HOUSING IS NOT SO BAD, OR WHERE ROAD, SEWER, AND 
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS HAVE TO BE MADE, RESIDENTS MIGHT 
BE RELOCATED FOR A SHORT TIME TO TEMPORARY FACILITIES. 
 
4. (LOU) OUR CONTACTS STRESSED THE ATTENTION WHICH IS 
BEING PAID TO THE NEEDS OF NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS. 
FOR EXAMPLE, IF SOCIAL WORKERS DETERMINE THAT 
RESIDENTS TO BE RELOCATED INCLUDE LARGE NUMBERS OF 
CHILDREN, SCHOOLS WILL BE BUILT IN THE NEW HOUSING 
AREAS.  ALSO, IF LARGE NUMBERS OF WORKERS ARE 
DISPLACED FROM CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THEIR JOBS BY THE 
RELOCATION, ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO IMPROVING 
TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES. 
 
5. (LOU) BOTH OFFICIALS DISCOUNTED THE POSSIBILITY 
THAT NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO 
LEAVE THEIR HOMES.  FIRST OF ALL, THE RESIDENTS ARE 
BEING MOVED TO MUCH-IMPROVED HOUSING.  SECONDLY, OUR 
CONTACTS CLAIMED, MOST OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE 
TARGETTED NEIGHBORHOODS ARE MIGRANTS FROM OUTSIDE OF 
THE CITY.  THEY HAVE LITTLE LONG-TERM ATTACHMENT TO 
THEIR COMMUNITIES. 
 
6. (C) OUR CONTACTS BOTH VOLUNTEERED THAT THERE IS A 
SECURITY ASPECT TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT 
PROGRAM.  THOSE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH SURVEYING THE 
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ALSO IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL 
TROUBLEMAKERS, SUCH AS FUNDAMENTALISTS, WHO ARE OF 
CONCERN TO SECURITY OFFICIALS.  THOSE RESIDENTS WHO 
ARE OF CONCERN WILL BE RELOCATED TO AREAS AWAY FROM 
LIKE-MINDED NEIGHBORS OR TROUBLEMAKERS FROM OTHER 
NEIGHBORHOODS. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT:  ALEXANDRIAS AMBITIOUS IMPROVEMENT 
PROGRAM IS UNDOUBTEDLY PART OF A NATIONAL EFFORT TO 
TARGET SOME SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CAUSES OF 
FUNDAMENTALIST EXTREMISM.  THOSE OFFICIALS WITH WHOM 
WE SPOKE, WHO HAVE IN THE PAST HAVE SHOWN A KEEN 
SENSE AND CONCERN FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS NEEDS, SEEM 
GENUINELY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT; THE DISTRICT MAYOR 
SAID HE HOPED TO SEE REAL PROGRESS IN SIX MONTHS TO A 
YEAR.  IT IS INTERESTING THAT OUR CONTACTS FREELY 
DISCUSSED THE SECURITY ASPECTS OF THE ALEXANDRIA 
PROGRAM, ACKNOWLEDGING THE NEED TO ROOT OUT AND 
ISOLATE EXTREMISTS WHILE ELIMINATING THE REASONS FOR 
AND SOURCES OF THEIR LOCAL SUPPORT.  END COMMENT.
