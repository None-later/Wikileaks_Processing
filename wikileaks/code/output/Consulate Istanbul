SUBJ: CONVERSATION WITH FEMALE UNIVERSITY OF 
      TEHRAN PROFESSOR 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  CONOFF SPOKE WITH A 32 YEAR OLD 
IRANIAN FEMALE PROFESSOR WHO TEACHES MANAGEMENT 
AT AL ZAHRAH UNIVERSITY AND ENGLISH LITERATZE 
AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY.  SHE DESCRIBED CONDITIONS 
IN TEHRAN AND AT THE UNIVERSITY.  DURING ONE 
VERY EMOTIONAL MOMENT SHE COMPLAINED THAT THE 
CURRENT SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF WESTERN 
INTERFERENCE IN IRANIAN INTERNAL POLITICAL 
AFFAIRS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  CONOFF SPOKE BRIEFLY WITH A 32 YEAR OLD FEMALE 
PROFESSOR FROM AL ZAHRAH (WOMEN\'S) UNIVERSITY IN 
THE VANAK NEIGHBORHOOD OF TEHRAN.  SHE ALSO TEACHES 
AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY.  SHE TEACHES 12 HOURS PER 
WEEK AT AL ZAHRAH THE FORMER FARAH UNIVERSITY, 
WHICH IS A WOMEN ONLY UNIVERSITY AND 8 HOURS PER 
WEEK AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY.  IN TEHRAN UNIVERSITY 
SHE IS ONE OF 30 FEMALE FACULTY MEMBERS IN THE 
DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH LITERATURE. 
 
4.  SHE SAID THAT MOST OF THE STUDENTS ENROLLED 
IN COURSES IN THE ENGLISH LITERATURE DEPARTMENT 
ARE LEARNING ENGLISH TO ENABLE THEM TO STUDY 
ADVANCED COURSE WORK IN OTHER FACULTIES, WHICH 
USE TEXTS AND RESEARCH MATERIALS PUBLISHED IN 
ENGLISH.  ALTHOUGH THE CLASSROOMS AND LECTURE HALLS 
ARE CO-ED THE MALE STUDENTS SIT ON ONE SIDE OF THE 
ROOM AND THE FEMALE STUDENTS SIT IN A GROUP ON THE 
OPPOSITE SIDE.  ALL FEMALE STUDENTS AND FEMALE 
FACULTY HAVE TO WEAR \"APPROPRIATE ISLAMIC DRESS.\" 
WHEN ASKED IF SHE WAS TREATED WITH RESPECT BY THE 
MALE STUDENTS SHE SAID THAT SHE HAS NEVER HAD A 
PROBLEM. 
 
5.  INFORMANT TOLD CONOFF THAT IT IS HER OPINION 
THAT THE MAJORITY OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN IRAN HAVE 
CONNECTION TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLICAN PARTY, A CERTAIN 
MULLAH, OR IN SOME WAY HAVE CONVINCED OFFICIALS OF 
THEIR STRONG ISLAMIC BELIEFS.  SHE ADDED, HOWEVER, 
THAT MOST PEOPLE IN IRAN ARE TIRED OF THE REGIME, 
A COMMENT WE HAVE HEARD NUMEROUS TIMES FROM A WIDE 
ASSORTMENT OF PEOPLE.  PEOPLE HAVE TO ACT FAITHFUL 
AND \"PRETEND TO FOLLOW THOSE STUPID, CRAZY MULLAHS, 
BUT THE MAJORITY NO LONGER BELIEVES IN THE GOVERNMENT. 
HOW CAN THEY WHEN THINGS ARE SO EXPENSIVE AND ALL 
THOSE BOYS ARE DYING IN THAT SENSELESS WAR IN BASRA.\" 
 
6.  WHEN ASKED WHY THE REGIME IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE 
IF SO MANY PEOPLE DISLIKE IT SHE SAID THAT EVERYONE 
IS AFRAID.  \"IF YOU GO ALONG WITH THEM THEY WON\'T 
HURT YOU AND THERE IS ALWAYS SOME BENEFIT, LIKE THE 
STUDENTS GETTING ACCEPTED INTO UNIVERSITY.\"  SHE 
ADDED, \"THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT IF THEY DEMONSTRATE 
KHOMEINI WILL KILL THEM.  SHE POINTED OUT THAT THE 
SHAH CONTINUED TO PAY STRIKING WORKERS AND ADDED 
\"IF HIS TROOPS HAD KILLED A FEW THOUSAND HE WOULD 
STILL BE IN POWER.  KHOMEINI WOULD DO THAT WITHOUT 
THINKING ABOUT IT.  THAT\'S WHY NO ONE TRIES TO 
CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT.\" 
 
7.  SHE SAID THAT THIS YEAR APPROXIMATELY 600,000 
STUDENTS WOULD TAKE PART IN THE NATION-WIDE 
UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAMS BUT ONLY 40,000 TO 50,000 
WOULD BE ACCEPTED.  \"THIS AND THE WAR IS WHY YOUP 
HAVE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE OUT IN THE WAITING ROOM,\" 
SHE SAID.  \"DO YOU BLAME THEM?  IF THEY DON\'T GET 
ADMITTED TO A UNIVERSITY WHAT CAN THEY DO, THERE 
ARE NO JOBS.\"  WHEN ASKED HER OPINION OF THE NIV 
APPLICANTS SHE SAID,\" I TOLD YOU.  THERE ARE NO 
JOBS.  FOR THE BOYS IF THEY CAN\'T GO TO SCHOOL 
WHAT IS LEFT?  GOING TO THE MILITARY.\" 
 
8.  INFORMANT SAID THAT FEMALE UNIVERSITY FACULTY 
ARE PAID SALARIES EQUAL TO THAT OF MALE COUNTERPARTS 
AND THERE IS NO OPEN DISCRIMINATION, HOWEVER, \"THEY 
DO THINGS, LITTLE THINGS TO UPSET YOU.\" 
A FACULTY MEMBER IS ONLY ALLOWED TO TEACH 24 HOURS PER 
WEEK, BUT THEY TRY TO FIND EXCUSES TO KEEP WOMEN 
FROM CARRYING A FULL LOAD. \"HAVING HAIR EXPOSED 
COULD BE GROUNDS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION, SUCH AS 
HAVING A COURSE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOUR SCHEDULE.\" 
SHE TOLD CONOFF THAT MOST STUDENTS ARE BIDDING THEIR 
TIME, HOPING THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS 
WILL IMPROVE BY THE TIME THEY GRADUATE.  SHE BELIEVES 
THAT THE AVERAGE STUDENT IS WEAKER AND LESS MOTIVATED 
THAN IN THE PAST.  \"THERE REALLY ISN\'T MUCH INCENTIVE 
TO EXCELL.\" 
 
9.  AFTER LENGTHY QUESTIONING SHE JOKED THAT CONOFF 
SHOULD TELL HER WHEN THE U.S. PLANS TO TOPPLE 
KHOMEINI.  WE FIND IT INTERESTING THAT MANY IRANIANS 
INCLUDING EDUCATED AND WESTERN-ORIENTED PROFESSIONALS 
SUCH AS THIS PROFESSOR BELIEVE THAT THE SHAH\'S 
DOWNFALL WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE U.S. OR A 
COMBINATION OF WESTERN POWER BROKERS.  WHEN 
CONOFF REMINDED HER THAT THERE WERE NO AMERICANS 
IN IRAN TO PROVIDE US INFORMATION SHE LAUGHED AND 
SAID, \"YOU DON\'T HAVE TO HAVE AN AMERICAN TO TELL 
YOU WHAT IS GOING ON; THE CIA DOESN\'T USE JUST 
AMERICANS.  I\'M SURE THAT YOU OR SOMEONE IN YOUR 
GOVERNMENT KNOWS JUST AS MUCH AS RAFSANJANI AND 
KHOMEINI DO ABOUT MY COUNTRY.\" 
 
10.  COMMENT.  IN THE IRANIAN WORLDVIEW THERE IS 
ALWAYS SOMEONE OR SOMETHING ELSE TO BLAME FOR 
ONE\'S MISFORTUNES.  THIS MAY BE A RULER, A BOSS, 
THE WEATHER OR FATE IN GENERAL.  IT IS INTERESTING, 
HOWEVER, THAT SO MANY IRANIANS BELIEVE THAT THE 
U.S. INTERESTS ARE ENHANCED BY PROLONGING THE WAR 
BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ AND BY KEEPING KHOMEINI IN 
POWER.  END COMMENT.

PART THREE IN A SERIES. 
 
REF: A) ISTANBUL 770  B) ISTANBUL 960 
 
 
1.   CONFIDENTIAL.  CLASSIFIED BY CONS THOMAS H. CARTER 
FOR REASONS 1.5.(B) AND (D). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY:  THE FAMILY OF ALI AKBAR HASHEMI 
RAFSANJANI, ESPECIALLY HIS DAUGHTER FAEZEH, WILL REMAIN 
POWERFUL DESPITE RAFSANJANI\'S IMMINENT RETIREMENT, SAYS 
AN IRANIAN BUSINESSMAN.  AZAN TALEGHANI, DAUGHTER OF THE 
LATE AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI, ADDS THAT FEMALE 
REPRESENTATION IN THE MAJLES IS INCREASING BUT IRANIAN 
WOMEN HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING WORK IN ANY FIELD OTHER 
THAN TEACHING.  ADVOCACY GROUPS SUCH THE ISLAMIC WOMEN\'S 
INSTITITUTE OF IRAN, OF WHICH MS. TALEGHANI IS 
PRESIDENT, HELP FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS AND PROFESSIONALS 
FIND JOBS.  THIS REPORT IS THE THIRD IN A SERIES. 
REFTELS A AND B DEALT WITH THE US EMBARGO, IRANIAN 
RELIGIOUS FOUNDATIONS, AND THE SEPARATION OF MOSQUE AND 
STATE IN IRAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
FAEZEH RAFSANJANI WANTS TO BE SPEAKER 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) IF CURRENT MAJLES SPEAKER NATEQ-NURI WINS THE 
NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AS EXPECTED, RAFSANJANI\'S 
OLDEST CHILD FAEZEH MAY BECOME SPEAKER OF THE MAJLES OR 
A PRESIDENTIAL DEPUTY.  SOURCE, A MULTI-LINGUAL AND 
HIGHLY EDUCATED IRANIAN BUSINESSMAN, HAS A FRIEND WHO 
PLAYS VOLLEYBALL FOR THE IRANIAN NATIONAL TEAM AND WHO 
ATTENDED A DINNER IN JANUARY AT WHICH FAEZEH SPOKE. 
(NOTE: FAEZEH IS CURRENTLY THE HEAD OF THE IRANIAN 
ATHLETIC FEDERATION.)  FAEZEH TOLD THE ASSEMBLY THAT SHE 
WOULD WORK HARD AS SPEAKER OF THE MAJLES TO OPEN DOORS 
TO THE WEST SO THAT ATHLETES COULD COMPETE 
INTERNATIONALLY. SHE ALSO MENTIONED THAT SHE WOULD 
REPRESENT HER FATHER IN THE POLITICAL ARENA AND THAT SHE 
WOULD CARRY ON HIS FIGHT TO MODERNIZE IRAN. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT:  FAEZEH\'S STATEMENTS MAKE CLEAR HER 
SYMPATHY WITH PRAGMATISTS IN THE MAJLES.  DURING LAST 
YEAR\'S ELECTION SEASON FAEZEH MADE SEVERAL CONTROVERSIAL 
STATEMENTS SUCH AS HER BELIEF THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO RIDE BICYCLES FREELY IN TEHRAN PARKS.  SHORTLY AFTER 
THE ELECTIONS THE CONSERVATIVE COALITION LED BY KHAMANEI 
CONSOLIDATED POWER AND FAEZEH BECAME MUCH LESS VOCAL-- 
OUR SOURCES CLAIM SHE FEARED DECERTIFICATION.  HER 
WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK OUT AGAIN SIGNALS EITHER HER 
GROWING CONFIDENCE, THE GROWING CONFIDENCE OF THE HARD- 
LINERS THAT THEY ARE FIRMLY IN POWER AND NOT THREATENED 
BY FAEZEH, OR BOTH.  END COMMENT. 
 
----------------------------- 
FAEZEH\'S GENDER NOT IMPORTANT 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) SOURCE SAYS FAEZEH\'S GENDER IS NOT AN ISSUE 
BECAUSE SHE IS A RAFSANJANI AND BECAUSE OF HER STRONG 
PERSONALITY.  THE MAJLES HAS A GROWING CONTINGENT OF 
FEMALE REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING FARZANI MAYED OF 
ISFAHAN AND FARZANI MAJOUB OF TEHRAN.  MAHJOUB IS A 
PRAGMATIST AND THE DAUGHTER OF DR. (FNU) MAHJOUB, FORMER 
MINISTER OF EDUCATION UNDER THE SHAH.  SOURCE BELIEVES 
WOMEN WERE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION 
BUT WERE SHORTCHANGED BY KHOMEINI AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN 
GIVEN PROPER CREDIT OR AUTHORITY. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  REGARDING FAEZEH BECOMING SPEAKER, 
SOURCE\'S LENSES MAY BE A BIT ROSE-COLORED.  A SURVEY OF 
OTHER IRANIANS COMING THROUGH ISTANBUL PRODUCED ONLY 
OPINIONS TO THE CONTRARY.  ONE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT 
EMPLOYEE SAID A WOMAN COULD NEVER ACHIEVE A LEADERSHIP 
POSITION IN IRAN.  EVEN NOW THERE IS DISAGREEMENT ON THE 
TALLY OF FAEZEH\'S ELECTION RESULTS FROM LAST SPRING. 
LIBERAL SOURCES SAY SHE RECEIVED THE MOST VOTES OF ANY 
CANDIDATE AND WOULD BE SPEAKER BUT FOR THE FACT THAT SHE 
IS A WOMAN.  MEANWHILE TWO OF THE MAJOR IRANIAN DAILIES 
CLAIMED SHE RECEIVED THE SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES, 
AND SEVERAL CONSERVATIVE SOURCES CLAIM SHE SIMPLY 
RECEIVED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES OF ANY FEMALE 
CANDIDATE.  END COMMENT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
OTHER RAFSANJANI CHILDREN COMING INTO THEIR OWN 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7.  (C) PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI WILL REMAIN POWERFUL AFTER 
HIS RETIREMENT IN AUGUST, SOURCE SAYS, THANKS TO THE 
GROWING WEALTH AND INFLUENCE OF HIS FAMILY.  IN ADDITION 
TO FAEZEH, THE PRESIDENT HAS TWO OTHER CHILDREN. 
RAFSANJANI\'S SECOND CHILD, YASSER, CONTROLS THE IMPORTS 
OF MANY MAJOR EAST ASIAN COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN 
IRAN AND IS SAID TO HAVE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS; HIS 
OTHER SON, MEHDI, IS DOING WELL AS THE HEAD OF A 
BUSINESS GROUP WHICH HAS TIES TO GERMAN, CANADIAN, AND 
JAPANESE FIRMS.  SOURCE CLAIMS THE RAFSANJANI FAMILY 
OWNS MOST OF RAFSANJAN--AN IMPORTANT PISTACHIO-GROWING 
TOWN AND REGION--AND PRODUCES \"RAFSANJAN PISTACHIOS\" 
WHICH ACCOUNT FOR NINETY PERCENT OF ALL PISTACHIO 
EXPORTS FROM IRAN.  HE ADDS THAT THE FAMILY ALSO 
CONTROLS THE PROFITABLE \"FREE-TRADE ZONE\" ON QESHM 
ISLAND IN THE PERSIAN GULF. 
 
8.  (C) COMMENT:  SOURCE VIEWS THE WEALTH OF THE 
RAFSANJANI FAMILY IN A FAVORABLE LIGHT, BUT OTHER 
IRANIANS ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF CORRUPTION AND 
NEPOTISM.  THE CONTROL OVER THE RAFSANJAN PISTACHIO 
BUSINESS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY OTHER SOURCES, ALTHOUGH 
THE NINETY PERCENT FIGURE MAY BE HIGH.  RAFSANJANI\'S 
CONTROL OVER THE QESHM FREE ZONE IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE. 
IN ANY CASE, THE RAFSANJANI FAMILY IS ASSURED OF A LARGE 
AND STEADY INCOME FROM THEIR BROADENING VENTURES.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI\'S DAUGHTER GIVES INPUT 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9.  (C) IN EARLY MARCH AZAN TALEGHANI, PRESIDENT OF THE 
ISLAMIC WOMEN\'S INSTITUTE OF IRAN, CAME THROUGH ISTANBUL 
ON HER WAY TO A UN CONFERENCE IN NY.  MS. TALEGHANI IS 
THE DAUGHTER OF THE LATE AYATOLLAH MAHMOUD TALEGHANI, A 
PIVOTAL FIGURE IN THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION.  ACCORDING TO 
MS. TALEGHANI THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN POLITICS IS 
GROWING.  DURING THE SHAH\'S TIME THERE WERE NEVER MORE 
THAN FOUR WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT, NOR DID THE NUMBER RISE 
AFTER THE REVOLUTION.  FOLLOWING THE 1992 PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS, HOWEVER, NINE FEMALE MEMBERS WON POSITIONS IN 
THE MAJLES.  FOUR MORE WERE ELECTED IN THE 1996 
ELECTIONS, BRINGING THE TOTAL TO THIRTEEN.  TALEGHANI 
SAYS FOUR OF THE THIRTEEN WOMEN IN THE MAJLES ARE 
LIBERAL/PRAGMATISTS, THREE ARE CONSERVATIVES, AND THE 
OTHER SIX DO NOT HAVE CLEAR AFFILIATIONS.  SEVERAL 
FEMALE LIBERAL CANDIDATES WERE NOT CERTIFIED BY THE 
COUNCIL OF GUARDIANS IN THE LAST ELECTIONS OR THE NUMBER 
COULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER. 
 
10.  (C) MS. TALEGHANI SAYS THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM 
WOMEN FACE IN IRAN IS THE INABLITY TO ENTER THE WORK 
FORCE.  THE PRIMARY TASK OF HER ORGANIZATION IS TO GET 
WOMEN INTO WELL-PAYING JOBS.  THE ORGANIZATION\'S MOST 
SUCCESSFUL VENTURE SO FAR IS A TEXTILE COOPERATIVE, 
MANAGED AND STAFFED BY WOMEN, WHICH MAKES CLOTHING FOR 
EXPORT TO DUBAI.  SUCH SUCCESS IS RARE IN IRAN, SAYS 
TALEGHANI, AND MOST WOMEN WHO WORK ARE TEACHERS. MORE 
YOUNG WOMEN THAN EVER BEFORE ARE RECEIVING SECONDARY AND 
HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT OUTSIDE OF TEACHING THERE ARE FEW 
PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN.  MS. TALEGHANI WAS 
A TEACHER FOR MANY YEARS AND ACTUALLY HAD FAEZEH 
RAFSANJANI AS A STUDENT.  TALEGHANI SAYS FAEZEH WAS \"NOT 
A REMARKABLE STUDENT,\" BUT IS PLEASED WITH HER 
POLITICAL SUCCESS AND WITH THE PROGRESS THIS REPRESENTS 
FOR IRANIAN WOMEN. 
 
11.  (U) NOTE:  SOURCE\'S FATHER--AYATOLLAH MAHMOUD 
TALEGHANI--WAS A UNIVERSITY TEACHER AND LEFTIST ISLAMIC 
THEORIST PERSECUTED THROUGHOUT THE SHAH\'S REGIME.  HIS 
FAMILY HAD DEEP ROOTS AMONG THE BAZAARI (MERCHANT CLASS) 
IN TEHRAN, AND MAINTAINS EVEN NOW SOME OF ITS 
CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE.  ACCORDING TO JOHN STEMPEL\'S 
\"INSIDE THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION\" TALEGHANI \"...WAS 
IDOLIZED BY THE URBAN POOR AND BY THE YOUNG 
INTELLECTUALS IN BOTH MUJAHADIN AND FEDAYEEN CIRCLES FOR 
HIS OPPOSITION TO THE SHAH....  HE WAS THE ONLY 
INDIVIDUAL [AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTION] WHOSE 
PERSONAL REPUTATION WAS IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH TO DEFY 
KHOMEINI.\"  A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI 
AND AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI THREATENED THE REVOLUTION AND 
COULD HAVE RESULTED IN CIVIL WAR, BUT TALEGHANI 
EVENTUALLY CONCEDED TO KHOMEINI FOR THE SAKE OF UNITY. 
HE DIED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS.

PROSPECT OF AK

Classified By: Consul General David Arnett.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: While much of Istanbul\'s secular 
establishment remains wary and suspicious of Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan\'s Justice and Development (AK) party, soundings among 
market insiders in Istanbul on the eve of Sunday\'s polls show 
a more nuanced view among the city\'s business elite.  In 
contrast to the doom and gloom scenarios we heard earlier 
this fall from market analysts who saw anything but a Kemal 
Dervis-led post-election economic team as a catastrophe that 
would swiftly lead to an economic meltdown, markets are 
increasingly coming to terms with an AK government.  The 
decline in political uncertainty will likely help the current 
market rally.  But we have also heard concerns with the 
economic policies of the new government, and with some of the 
likely AK economic policy-makers.  We believe that following 
elections, and a short honeymoon, these concerns will start 
to grow.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) Watchful Waiting: As ref B related, Istanbul\'s secular 
establishment is resigned to the prospect of an AK victory in 
Sunday\'s election, but remains deeply troubled about what it 
bodes for the future of Turkey\'s secular republic. 
Surprisingly, however, given their worries earlier this fall 
and their tendency at that time to see former Minister of 
State Kemal Dervis as the Turkish economy\'s only potential 
savior, Istanbul financial circles now appear to be 
increasingly at ease with the prospect of AK\'s coming to 
power.  Analysts such as Global Director of Research Cem 
Akyurek and Garanti Securities Executive Director David 
Edgerly now indicate that an AK victory will not preclude a 
short-term market rally, and can potentially even lead to a 
\"virtuous circle\" in which interest rates decline and ease 
the risk of a Turkish financing gap next year.  Testimony to 
the Istanbul financial community\'s coming to terms with the 
prospect of AK are the recent performance of major market 
indicators: the Istanbul Stock exchange and interest rates 
have all remained relatively stable, even in the face of 
occasional gaffes by Erdogan and his deputies.  The market\'s 
tolerant attitude has been, in the words of one banker, that 
\"better they make these mistakes before the election, than 
after, when they might cause real trouble.\" 
 
 
3. (C) \"Market Friendly\": Beyond the need to put the best 
face on what appears to be inevitable, a number of factors 
appear to be at play in the financial community\'s attitude 
toward AK.  Many believe (as Edgerly told us) 
\"philosophically AK is market friendly,\"  and by nature and 
inclination will be supportive of the securities market 
(though perhaps \"less so\" of debt markets).  A second factor 
is the market\'s ever-present hope for stability, and desire 
to avoid uncertainty, and the resultant genuine 
attractiveness of the prospect of a strong one or at most 
two-party government, even if it involves an untested player 
like AK.  Perhaps most importantly, there is also the hope 
that AK understands that its economic options are limited, 
and that it has no alternative to continuing to implement the 
country\'s economic reform program.  We heard this repeatedly: 
from bankers, securities firms, and businessmen in the real 
sector.  They argued that \"AK is not stupid\" and will stick 
with the program, since it has no alternative, and since it 
will want to show it can govern responsibly.  (Comment: Some 
AK Economic officials, such as Vice Chairman Ali Coskun, do 
not seem concerned that they have no alternative, per ref d.) 
 Dissent came only from the influential TUSIAD, where Deputy 
Secretary General Umit Ismen reminded us of a board member\'s 
 
SIPDIS 
admonition to \"remember that we are viewing things 
rationally, while politics does not always follow those 
rules.\" 
 
 
4. (C) A Weak Bench?: A more widespread concern in business 
circles here is whether AK has the economic bench strength to 
manage a complex economic challenge.  There is thus worry 
about how sustainable any stability provided by an AK 
government will be.  Global\'s Cem Akyurek told us recently 
that the answers to two questions he had recently suggested 
that a New York colleague ask a visiting AK delegation had 
only reinforced his skepticism about the party.  When under 
questioning the AK speaker indicated that he had been a REFAH 
supporter and that his business experience consisted of a 
brief stint in the textile industry, Akyurek\'s doubts were 
confirmed.  \"These are not the people who can solve Turkey\'s 
problems,\" he argued.  There is some indication, however, 
that AK\'s ability to move beyond its base and attract other 
center-right wing supporters is easing this concern. 
5. (C) Weak Opposition: Above all, AK is benefiting from its 
opposition.  To be sure, Dervis and his Republican People\'s 
Party (CHP) allies remain the market\'s preference, though 
disappointment is widespread that he has not been more 
effective politically.  Dervis\' recent Radikal interview, 
which Ismen characterized as the \"talk of the town,\" appears 
to have done particular damage, reinforcing his \"statist\" 
image and leaving a bad taste even among his business 
backers, particularly with his claim never to have supported 
the privatization of Turk Telecom.  AK has also benefited 
from comparison to the other two parties that now appear to 
have a chance to cross the threshold: Cem Uzan\'s Genc (Youth) 
Party and Tansu Ciller\'s DYP (ref c).  In contrast to these 
two parties\' populist promises and (in Ciller\'s case) 
\"stubborn refusal to learn from past mistakes\" (by pledging 
to return to a managed exchange rate), AK\'s campaign has 
seemed \"relatively responsible\" in comparison.  Hence Dervis\' 
charges that the party is using different messages for 
different audiences has not resonated, as observers accept it 
as part of politics, and in any case see AK\'s domestic 
promises as much less dangerous than those of its rivals. 
\"Hurriyet\" economic commentator Ege Cansen, for instance, 
suggested recently in his column that Uzan is the pivotal 
figure of this election, and that his most nefarious effect 
has been to cause Ciller to adopt a similarly \"pandering\" 
message.  Amplifying on these comments at a recent dinner for 
visiting Johns Hopkins professor Francis Fukuyama, he saw a 
particular danger in these \"negative political influences\" 
and the possibility they might impel Erdogan to adopt similar 
policies. 
 
 
6.  (C) Comment: Beyond making a virtue of necessity, 
financial markets will likely be cautiously optimistic 
following elections, on the back of declining political 
uncertainty.  But at some point in the government formation 
process, the concerns we are already hearing about likely GOT 
policies (and about some of the likely AK policymakers) could 
start to grow quickly.  End Comment.

SUBJECT:  REVIEW OF THE FULBRIGHT GLOBAL WOMEN\'S 
CONFERENCE IN ISTANBUL, SEPTEMBER 18-21, 2002 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  PA Istanbul cooperated with the Bureau 
of Educational and Cultural Affairs in executing the 
first-ever Fulbright-sponsored conference bringing 
together 110 r 110 women from the Middle East, North 
Africa, South Asia, Europe and Central Asia to focus 
on the role of women as leaders in the global 
community.  The conference was amplyheavily covered 
by Turkish media. Assistant  Assistant Secretary 
Harrison personally presented to Turkish recipients 
both a scholarship and an award under the ECA 
Partnerships for Learning Initiative.Preparation of 
a final text of the conference presentations and 
proceedings awaits selection of an editor END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  The Fulbright-sponsored \"Women in the Global 
Community\" conference was hosted on the historic 
campus of Bogazici University (originally founded by 
Congregationalist missionaries in 1863 as Robert 
College) on September 18 - 21, featuring sessions on 
a wide array of topics, including education, public 
health, information technology, war and peace, 
culture and ethnicity, and the role of women in the 
political process. 
 
 
3.  Assistant Secretary of State Patricia Harrison, 
Ambassador Pearson, Senior Coordinator of the Office 
of International Women\'s Issues April Palmerlee, and 
the Consul General participated with university vice 
rector Sevket Pamuk in ceremonies opening the 
conference.  During the course of the conference 
Assistant Secretary Harrison met with several 
leading Turkish businesswomen, resulting in plans 
for the establishment of a chapter in Turkey of the 
International Women\'s Forum, as well as with a group 
of American Fulbright students who related their 
experiences in Turkey and who were invited by the 
Assistant Secretary to write recommendations for the 
program.  The keynote address, \"Historical 
Perspective: The Turkish Example,\" was delivered by 
Professor Akile Gursoy, prominent sociologist and 
granddaughter of Turkey\'s third president, Celal 
Bayar. 
 
 
4.  The conference attracted more than 110 overseas 
participants from the Middle East, South Asia, North 
Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, including 
scholars from Afghanistan, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, 
India, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Nepal, Palestine, 
Tunisia, Europe and the United States.  More than 
150 Turkish women NGO leaders, academics and 
business persons, as well as former Fulbright and 
Humphrey grantees, constituted the main conference 
audience.  Sessions were varied in style and 
presentation, and debate throughout was lively. The 
most heavily-attended panels were on \"The Role of 
Women in Rebuilding Afghanistan,\" \"Women in Turkey,\" 
and \"Civil Society: War and Peace.\"  The conference 
program included evening screenings of award-winning 
films produced/directed by women filmmakers at the 
Mithat Elam Film Center on campus and an exhibit of 
books by women writers (to be donated to the host 
institution). Turkish print and electronic media 
covered the opening ceremonies and concluding 
banquet.  In addition, the Library of Congress film 
team recorded the entire conference for display on 
its website. 
 
 
5.  During the final banquet of the conference a 
Fulbright scholarship provided by the Bureau of 
Educational and Cultural Affairs for $50,000 was 
announced in honor of the late Inci Pirinccioglu, 
one of the first Turkish Fulbright students, who 
returned to Turkey from study at Columbia University 
during the 1950s to build a successful travel and 
events planning business.  The Pirinccioglu family 
was present at the occasion, spoke of the effect of 
the Fulbright program on their mother\'s life, and 
announced their intention to establish a reciprocal 
Fulbright award which would support an American 
student studying in Turkey. 
 
 
6.  In conjunction with the conference, Assistant 
Secretary Harrison announced a $250,000 award under 
 
SIPDIS 
ECA\'s Partnerships for Learning Initiative to the 
U.S.-Turkish Binational Commission to enable Turkish 
undergraduate students with demonstrated financial 
need to study in the United States at several 
campuses of the State University of New York (SUNY) 
system.  The announcement was made at a press 
conference in the consulate general garden following 
a meeting with the rectors of ten Turkish 
universities, including five universities from the 
southeast of the country.  It is anticipated that 
other donors, including the American university 
sector, will provide additional funding for this 
program. 
 
 
7.  Mass circulation Turkish dailies Hurriyet and

SUBJECT: Istanbul Anti-War Protest 
 
 
1. (U) Around 5,000 people in Istanbul protested against a 
possible U.S.-led operation against Iraq on Sunday.  The 
anti-war demonstration was organized with the participation 
of more than 170 NGOs, including the country\'s three big 
unions: Turk-Is (the Confederation of Turkish Labor Unions), 
the Confederation of Revolutionary Labor Unions (DISK) and 
the Confederation of Public Sector Labor Unions (KESK). 
Other participating organizations included the Chamber of 
Engineers and Architects, the Union of Turkish Doctors, 
Greenpeace, some political parties and several Islamist 
groups. 
 
 
2. (U) The protest started around 11.00 a.m. in Abide-I 
Hurriyet Square in Istanbul\'s downtown Sisli District under 
tight police control. During the meeting, the union leaders 
made speeches and the crowd chanted anti-US and anti-war 
slogans including \"No to Imperialist War,\" and \"We Will Not 
Be American Soldiers.\" The speakers included a British 
Member of Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn from the Labor Party. 
The crowd dispersed after a few hours and there was no 
violence during the demonstration. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Comment: Police contacts confirmed to us that 5,000 
people participated in the demonstration, but noted that 
they had anticipated a crowd twice that size.  End comment.

Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Turks in Istanbul continue to debate the 
merits and drawbacks of a possible Cyprus settlement in the 
wake of Denktas\'s acceptance of the UN plan as a \"basis for 
negotiations.\"  Consensus among the experts with whom we 
have spoken in Istanbul (including Turkish Cypriots, 
journalists, and academics) is that the plan is a good one, 
albeit with some serious flaws.  All of them look first and 
foremost to Ankara for clues on how Turkey will act in the 
coming weeks and months.  They believe that Denktas\'s 
conditional approval of the plan was inevitable (he could 
not afford to appear obstructionist in the face of pressure 
from the new Justice and Development Party (AKP) 
government), but that the Turkish side (and perhaps the 
Greek) will not be prepared to negotiate a plan for 
signature before the December 12 Copenhagen Summit. 
Furthermore, most of our interlocutors are convinced that 
the signals that the EU gives Turkey with regard to its 
membership bid at the summit are likely to have a major 
impact on Turkey\'s position in the upcoming Cyprus 
negotiations.  In the end, however, many of those we spoke 
to believe that the Annan plan is simply too good to be 
true -- the Greek Cypriots will ultimately either reject 
the deal outright or throw up unrealistic demands to ensure 
that no final agreement is reached.  End Summary. 
 
 
The Most Pro-Turkish Plan Ever 
------------------------------ 
2. (C) Murat Munir, a well-regarded journalist for Sabah 
newspaper (and a Turkish-Cypriot himself) told poloff that 
the Annan proposal was the \"most pro-Turkish plan\" ever 
presented.  He and others had only high praise for how the 
plan meets Turkish demands for sovereignty and equality in 
its \"common-state\" formula.  Kemal Kirisci, an expert on 
international affairs at Bogazici University, was also 
impressed by many of the details, including provisions for 
ensuring that Cyprus not be in a position to block Turkey\'s 
EU bid and for extending to both Greek and Turkish 
nationals the same entry and residency rights (a major 
concession, he noted, in light of Turkey\'s position outside 
the EU).  Oddly enough, one of the only criticisms we heard 
of the administrative arrangements was that the \"component 
states\" (as opposed to the \"common state\") were given too 
much authority.  Niyazi Bekiroglu, President of the 
Association of Turkish Cypriots in Turkey, explained to 
poloff that Greek immigration to the Turkish side may 
ultimately enable them to wrest control of local 
administration. 
 
 
We Give up Beaches, Farmland -- and are left with Mountains 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
3. (C) For the most part, criticism of the plan has 
focused not on the administrative arrangements, but on the 
territorial concessions and provisions for refugee return. 
\"We are being asked to give up the pristine beaches, the 
fertile farmland, and the port and water resources of 
Guzelyurt (Morphou).  What are we left with?...  The 
mountains,\" Bekiroglu lamented (Note: Bekiroglu claims that 
his views largely reflect those of the 150,000 Turkish 
Cypriots living in Turkey).  Cyprus watchers in Istanbul 
are still buzzing about the recent public remarks by former 
Turkish President Kenan Evren about how the Turkish 
military in 1974 never intended to take as much territory 
as they did and that they did so with the expectation that 
such land be used as a bargaining chip at the negotiating 
table.  When pressed on the issue of territory, all of 
those we spoke to admitted that such concessions (subject 
to some minor changes to the maps and special provisions 
regarding water and port rights in Guzelyurt) are possible. 
 
 
A Flood of Greek Refugees? 
-------------------------- 
4. (C) Conceding that the territorial concessions might 
ultimately be acceptable, Bekiroglu admitted that he was 
more concerned about the provisions allowing for the return 
of Greek refugees. According to Bekiroglu\'s calculations, 
the territorial concessions, the return of Greek refugees, 
the concurrent displacement of Turkish Cypriots, and the 
need for many non-Cypriot mainland Turks to return home 
will lead to the unacceptable displacement of a majority of 
the existing population in the TRNC.  Additionally, even 
with the annual limitations provided for in the plan, 
Bekiroglu worries that Greek immigration combined with 
Turkish emigration will quickly lead to unacceptably large 
Greek minorities (or even majorities) in certain areas on 
the Turkish side of the island.  Munir, too, argued that 
allowing Greeks to return to the north may ultimately 
undermine the viability of an agreement.  Although Munir 
concedes that the principle of refugee return may be 
necessary (although he suspects few will rush back), 
neither of the publics on either side of the Green Line is 
psychologically prepared to lower that long-standing 
barrier.  Munir said that his personal experience on the 
island suggests to him that the suspicion and distrust 
harbored in equal measure on both parts of the island would 
lead quickly to renewed violence if the communities are 
brought together too quickly. 
 
 
Ankara Calls the Shots 
---------------------- 
5. (C) Even assuming that the two publics come to support a 
settlement, Munir argues that it will require concerted 
pressure from Ankara to overcome those in the TRNC that 
have a vested economic interest in maintaining the status 
quo.  Most of our interlocutors seem convinced that the new 
AKP government would like to see a settlement.  The 
million-dollar questions, however, are: What does the 
Turkish deep state think?  Is AK\'s recent electoral mandate 
sufficient to sway the National Security Council (NSC) 
debates?  Kirisci and a former Turkish diplomat both argued 
that the military and more conservative elements of the 
secular establishment will be heavily influenced by the 
signals that Turkey gets on its membership bid from the 
December 12 EU Copenhagen Summit.  If (as Turkish President 
Sezer suggested in his remarks at the end of the NATO 
Prague Summit) the Europeans are engaging in \"double-talk,\" 
Turkey may feel that they cannot abandon the Turkish 
Cypriots to a double-dealing, anti-Turkish EU.  Note: Both 
also feel that Turkey may have made a tactical error in 
pushing for a \"date\" for negotiations.  It may be possible, 
they claim, to come up with some other sufficiently 
positive message that might convince the Euro-skeptics in 
Turkey. End Note. 
 
 
Doomed to Failure? 
------------------ 
6. (C) Our more pessimistic interlocutors believe that the 
deal will either be dashed to pieces on the rocks of the 
Copenhagen Summit or will founder on the shoals of Greek 
Cypriot opposition.  Bekiroglu, for example, suspects that 
the entire Annan plan is an EU trap.   Having \"bought\" the 
support of a select group of influential Turkish 
journalists (including Mehmet Ali Birand and Murat Munir), 
the EU seeks only to secure Turkish acquiescence and a 
Greek vote for EU enlargement at Copenhagen.  Others, 
including Bogazici University Professor Gun Kut, argued 
that the plan is simply to pro-Turkish to ever be approved 
by the Greek Cypriots.  Even assuming that Ankara throws 
its weight behind a settlement, they expect the Greek 
Cypriots to reject the plan in the proposed referendum (the 
publication of a recent poll showing that 64 percent of 
Greek Cypriots oppose the plan has not gone unnoticed in 
Istanbul) or simply put forth unacceptable demands to 
ensure a breakdown in negotiations.

1. (U) SENSITIVE-- NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION 
 
 
2. (SBU) SUMMARY: Officials at Istanbul\'s Center for Private 
Sector Development, a joint undertaking of the OECD and 
Turkish International Cooperation Administration (TICA), 
outlined an ambitious program of seminars and programs for 
next year in recent meetings with Pol/Econ Section Chief and 
Econ Specialist.  The center seeks to encourage the 
development of a vibrant and sustainable private sector in 
target regions through programs focusing on such themes as 
encouraging foreign direct investment, enterprise finance and 
financial sector development, investment and agribusiness, 
and rule of law and anticorruption efforts.  In addition, a 
handful of Turkey-specific activities are planned, including 
an assessment of regulatory reform in Turkey (the subject of 
a major series of OECD studies last year) and several 
sectoral workshops, organized in cooperation with the 
Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO)  As in the past, the 
center will focus on bringing together a range of government 
officials from transition economies to share experiences and 
focus on best practices.  In effect, Center Manager Engin 
Goksu stressed, the center functions as a \"miniature OECD\", 
focusing on the Southeastern European, Black Sea, Caucasus 
and Central Asian regions, but also including Russia, Eastern 
Europe and Mongolia.  While primarily funded by the OECD and 
TICA, the Center is also seeking enhanced cooperation with 
bilateral donors active in these areas, as well as with 
potential corporate sponsors of specific programs.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
 
 
3. (SBU) A Turkish/OECD Partnership: Pol/Econ Section Chief 
and Economic Specialist recently toured the spacious offices 
and conference facilities of Istanbul\'s \"Center for Private 
Sector Development\" in the downtown Eminonu district, 
overlooking the Golden Horn and Bosphorus.  The new 
facilities, which the center moved into last year, permit it 
to organize conferences on site, obviating the need to rent 
more expensive facilities at local hotels.  TICA and the OECD 
jointly support the center\'s activities, with Turkey paying 
for the Istanbul facilities for the center, as well as 
covering lodging and per diem costs for conference and 
seminar participants.  The OECD largely covers the costs of 
the materials and experts who organize the seminars (Center 
Manager Goksu is on the OECD\'s Paris staff), leaving sending 
countries responsible only for the airfare for their 
participating officials.  On average, the center hosts 15-20 
programs a year, with some 30-50 participants per program. 
Goksu indicated, however, that in some instances Central 
Asian countries in particular have had difficulty paying the 
high airfares from the region, so that Central Asian 
participation has suffered as a result.  He indicated that in 
his travels through the region in recent weeks he has sought 
to disseminate information about the center to various 
bilateral aid missions, in the hope of encouraging future 
cooperation to help meet some of these costs. 
 
 
4. (SBU) 2003 Program: Goksu outlined an ambitious draft 
agenda of 22 separate programs for the center in 2003.  Eight 
programs will be devoted to encouraging foreign direct 
investment, including sessions on investment in the tourism 
sector (a followup to a 2002 program to assess the impact of 
the earlier session), public-private partnerships, exchange 
controls and liberalization and its impact on FDI, and FDI, 
privatization, and environmental issues.   Special regional 
seminars will address investment in extractive industries in 
the Caspian region, the Eurasia investment initiative 
(including the Black Sea Investment initiative), and the 
investment compact within the Stability Pact and the 
Southeast European Cooperative Initative (SECI).   Two 
programs are planned on enterprise finance and financial 
sector development, including enterprise finance and risk 
capital for Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchange (FEAS) 
member countries, and a FEAS group meeting on capital market 
development that will be held in Almaty.  Programs on 
investment and agribusiness are planned focusing primarily on 
Central Asia (in conjunction with UNCTAD), while the OECD 
itself will take the lead on a series of programs addressing 
Rule of Law issues, including \"Constitutional Courts on the 
role of constitutional law in the economic reform process,\" 
dispute settlement and commercial arbitration, and the annual 
meeting of the Anti-corruptio network for Transition 
Economies.  Finally, separate programs will address 
regulatory reform in Turkey, privatization in transition 
economies, EBRD programs for investors in transition 
economies, sectoral developments in Turkey (with Turkey\'s 
ISO), E-government and E-commerce, and WTO membership for 
transition economies. 
 
 
5. (SBU) \"A Miniature OECD\": Goksu stressed that the center 
essentially functions as a small-scale OECD, in that it 
provides a forum for officials from a range of transition 
economies to come together and exchange knowledge, best 
practices, and information on how policies can best be 
implemented.  While the center\'s geographic range is wide, 
reaching essentially from Vienna to Ulaanbator, its focus 
remains on the core regions of Southeastern Europe, the 
Caucasus, and Central Asia.  Officials from other Eastern 
European countries and the Russian Federation have 
participated as well, however, as have officials from 
Mongolia. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: In addition to being an important outreach 
mechanism for the OECD in its efforts to work with non-member 
transition economies, the center also represents a 
substantial commitment of resources by the GOT.  As such it 
particularly represents Turkey\'s commitment and efforts to 
build bridges to its newly independent neighbors in Central 
Asia and the Caucasus.  While the center has in the past also 
benefited from bilateral economic assistance, in particular 
from GTZ, that aid has now ended, and it is solely reliant on 
the GOT, OECD and assorted other international organizations 
that help organize some programs.  Goksu stressed, however, 
that he is committed to seeking not just some limited 
targeted bilateral assistance to facilitate attendance, but 
also to outreach to the corporate sector, as the center seeks 
to fulfill its mandate of encouraging private sector 
development in its target regions.  End comment.

Classified By: Consul General David Arnett. 
 Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The week after Copenhagen has been a tough 
one on Turkey\'s financial markets.  The Istanbul Stock 
Exchange (ISE) has slumped dramatically, losing over 14 
percent of its value, the Turkish lira has depreciated 7 
percent, and interest rates on lira-denominated Treasury 
bills have spiked up to over 55 percent (a rise of 5 
percent).  Istanbul market analysts ascribe the declines, 
however, not to disappointment with the summit\'s outcome, but 
to a return to the country\'s \"real\" agenda.  That agenda, 
they suggest, was largely drowned out in the media build-up 
to Copenhagen.  But now, attention is again returning to the 
other issues and risks before Turkey, including notably the 
prospect of an imminent military operation against Iraq and 
political uncertainty surrounding a new and largely untested 
majority government.  As for Copenhagen itself, analysts 
ascribed its lack of resonance not just to the decision\'s 
openness to interpretation, but to a concerted effort by 
Turkish government, business, and media to spin it 
positively.  End  Summary. 
 
 
2.  (U) Unsettled Markets: Markets have been active and 
unsettled over the last week.  In the first two days after 
the summit, the ISE slumped nearly 12 percent.  After 
stabilizing briefly, it resumed its downward trend on 
Thursday, December 19.  The lira and interest rates, Turkey\'s 
other two key economic indicators, responded similarly, with 
interest rates spiking back up to the mid-50s, and the lira 
again depreciating to a rate above 1.6 million to the dollar. 
 
 
3.  (C) EU Blues: Though increasing optimism in the run-up to 
Copenhagen about the prospects for a firm starting date for 
negotiations sparked fears that the markets would react 
negatively to the eventual outcome, in fact comment and 
reaction has been muted.  Cem Akyurek, research director at 
Global, Turkey\'s largest brokerage, attributed the reaction 
to a concerted effort by government, business, and media to 
put the best face on what he characterized as a \"strikingly 
negative\" decision.  Easing the task were the conflicting 
opinions about the outcome not just in the Turkish and 
international press, but from European and other leaders. 
Akyurek, who has been sceptical about AK\'s economic policies 
and leadership, also gave the government grudging credit for 
its \"mature\" response.  He pointed to the government\'s 
message that it remains committed to pressing forward on 
reform as an essential balm for the market, a view echoed by 
other analysts.  Bender Securities, for instance, 
characterized the \"EU anchor\" as a key positive over the long 
term in its daily market report. 
 
 
4.  (C) The \"Real\" Agenda: The market\'s ability to come to 
terms relatively quickly with the Copenhagen outcome has not 
provided overall relief, however.  Most analysts ascribe the 
negative trend to concern about Iraq and the prospects for 
imminent military action.  Others point also to initial 
missteps by the new government, particularly in the economic 
field, where lack of coordination has brought conflicting 
messages on issues ranging from Turkey\'s new public tender 
law (and whether the government plans to delay its 
implementation or not) to return of a portion of the 
compulsory savings accounts collected by the government in 
past decades.  On these issues, analysts remain divided. 
Akyurek remains strikingly pessimistic about AK and its 
plans, noting that the mixed messages he and visiting 
investors have heard in Ankara also extend to such key issues 
as maintenance of primary surplus and inflation targets. 
Others, however, are more sanguine: HC Istanbul Director Elif 
Zapparoli told us that she would be \"shocked\" if AK actually 
made good on those suggestions.  \"These guys are in this for 
the long haul,\" she suggested, and \"will not jeopardize their 
position by picking a fight with the IMF.\"  (Note: Akyurek\'s 
boss, Global Chairman Mehmet Kutman, also falls in this 
\"optimist\" camp.  In a recent mailing, he effusively 
characterized the AK government as \"young, hardworking, and 
highly disciplined,\" suggesting that for the first time in 
\"recent memory\" it offered Turkey \"the possibility of 
government in the spirit of public service.\") 
 
 
5. (C) Iraq: For Istanbul\'s market analysts, Iraq remains the 
new key wildcard.  Most ascribe recent market dynamics to 
increasing concern about the prospects for imminent military 
action, and the potential costs Turkey will face.  Drawing on 
the experience of the Gulf War, some studies estimate the 
potential impact on Turkey in the tens of billions of 
dollars.  (A recent-- albeit seriously flawed-- study by the 
Foreign Economic Relations Board estimated Turkey\'s losses at 
15-20 billion dollars).  Analysts admit that the issue cuts 
both ways, however.  In his recent letter, Kutman conceded 
that the costs of an operation \"will be very much outweighed 
by the benefit...of having a stable and democratic government 
in Iraq.\"  Zapparoli echoed these sentiments, while Akyurek 
also saw a safety net in the market\'s belief that given 
Turkey\'s strategic importance, neither the U.S. nor the IMF 
would permit it to fail. 
 
 
6. (C) Comment: Despite their disappointment, Turkey\'s 
markets have reacted calmly to the Copenhagen decision.  But 
at the same time, they have taken off the rose-colored 
glasses through which they filtered all other developments. 
With increasing uncertainty surrounding Iraq, and growing 
concerns about government policy, markets are likely in for a 
bumpy ride until the former situation is resolved, one way or 
another, and until the government imposes more discipline in 
conveying its economic message.  End Comment.

Classified By: Consul General David Arnett.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Istanbul contacts in the financial and real 
sectors agree that in its first month and a half Turkey\'s Ak 
government \"hasn\'t gotten it\" and has done a poor job on 
economic policy, thereby dissipating much of the goodwill 
generated by initial perceptions that a single-party 
government would break the deadlock that has constrained 
Turkish governments over the past decade.  Explanations range 
from a combination of inexperience, lack of coordination, and 
inconsistency, to a perception that far from being a unified 
party, Ak is riven into warring factions with the \"populist 
wing,\" at least to date, coming out on top.  Many believe 
that all is not lost, however.  While pessimists believe that 
AK will not get it under any circumstances, a not 
insignificant group believes that with the \"road map staring 
it in the face,\" economic forces will ultimately compel AK to 
stick with the program.  The failure of Tuesday\'s treasury 
auction (ref a) is seen by many as a salutory first warning 
by the markets, while PM Gul\'s subsequent budget 
pronouncements (ref b) have been taken as a sign that at 
least parts of the government are getting the message. 
Concern is also widespread about the economic impact on 
Turkey of an Iraq operation, though most agree that recent 
estimates are highly exaggerated (one contact quipped that 
they led him to conclude the \"U.S. is planning to attack 
Turkey rather than Iraq\").  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) Evaporating Euphoria: In a round of calls on leading 
bank, real sector, and market actors on Wednesday, January 8, 
visiting Ankara Econ Counselor and Istanbul Pol/Econ Chief 
heard a decidedly downbeat assessment of Ak\'s performance to 
date.  The meetings followed closely on Tuesday\'s 
unsuccessful Treasury Auction and overlapped with PM Gul\'s 
afternoon budget statement.  Akbank CEO Zafer Kurtul noted 
that positive market sentiment has rapidly dissipated in the 
face of Ak\'s expansive spending plans and failure to identify 
savings to pay for them.  Even Ak allies from within MUSIAD 
(the \"Islamic\" businessmen\'s association) conceded that 
Erdogan\'s \"populist\" policies have raised issues for the 
market, while longtime Ak skeptics at Bender Securities 
argued that the only possible \"method to the madness\" of 
recent government policies was expectation that at the end of 
the day neither the U.S. nor the IMF would allow Turkey to 
fail.  Optimism lingers in some camps, however.  ING Baring\'s 
Managing Director John McCarthy, a seasoned Turkey watcher, 
conceded that AK\'s \"honeymoon is over,\" but argued that 
despite its populist tendencies, Ak is \"smart enough to see 
the roadmap and won\'t tinker too much.\" 
 
 
3. (C) A Shot across the Bows: All pointed to the failure of 
the January 7 treasury auction to raise sufficient cash for 
the Treasury to meet its redemption requirements as an 
important warning to the government, as even the local 
\"primary dealers\" that have supported the market up to now 
failed to step up to the plate.  PM Gul\'s announcement of tax 
increases and spending cuts late on January 8 (ref b) was 
taken as evidence that the message had registered, but 
Bender\'s initial reading was that even taken at face value 
the measures will be insufficient to achieve a 6.5 percent 
primary surplus goal that Gul reiterated.  Bender Chief 
Economist Emin Ozturk noted too that covering the shortfall 
forced the Treasury to expend a significant portion of its 
foreign exchange account at the Central Bank.  A similar 
shortfall in the next auction on January 21, he warned, will 
deplete the account, leaving no \"cushion for the future.\" 
 
 
4. (C) Embattled Reformers?: The general consensus among 
those we canvassed was that economic understanding in AK is 
thin, limited mainly to Prime Minister Gul and State Minister 
Babacan and their entourages.  Deputy Prime Minister Sener 
had few admirers among those we talked to, while there was 
agreement that Erdogan too has \"not played a constructive 
role\" on economic policy.  Given perceived tensions between 
Gul and Erdogan, and doubts about how much weight Babacan 
carries within the government, there was concern about just 
how effective the reformist bloc could be.  Not all judge the 
situation hopeless, however.  McCarthy noted that a recent 
TUSIAD meeting in Ankara concluded that the organization 
could work with AK, but would need to \"support it to the 
extent we can\" to make up for its lack of depth and 
credentials. 
 
 
5. (C) Dangerous Tendencies: Observers also expressed concern 
that despite public pledges to make a new start, AK may 
revert to familiar patterns of nepotism and corruption. 
Bender pointed to anecdotal word that some party 
functionaries are resigning to create construction companies, 
presumably to benefit from public tenders, while indications 
that Interior Minister Aksu\'s brothers may be appointed to 
head BOTAS and Turkseker also raised concerns.  Bender also 
pointed to mutual suspicions between AK and ranking 
bureaucrats and pressure from the AK caucus to put \"loyal 
people\" in place as potential destabilizing factors. 
 
 
6. (C) Growth?: Less consensus existed on the question of 
where Turkey\'s economy is now.  While the Bank of New York 
said it has seen no movement, noting that its loan exposure 
has fallen by 2/3 to just over 300 million USD, Yapi Kredi 
Senior Economist Hasan Ersel said his bank has seen some 
progress in the real economy, though he only expects 4 
percent growth this year.  (Ersel conceded that absent a 
settlement between the Cukorova Group and BRSA, however, his 
own institution\'s embattled predicament is not sustainable 
past mid-year.)  Some other companies are also thriving. 
Lezzo Industries Chairman Erol Yarar (founding Chairman of 
Musiad) noted that his group expects 9 percent growth in 
sales this year and plans significant new investments, while 
AKBank CEO Kurtul noted that the bank is doing well and is 
working to increase market share in key product lines.  Both 
reminded us, however, that beyond the current range of macro 
issues facing AK, there are a whole range of structural 
impediments in the Turkish economy that hinder business and 
discourage investment.  These, they argued, will have to be 
addressed before Turkey is able to achieve truly sustainable 
and balanced growth. 
 
 
7. (C) Iraq: Concern about Iraq\'s impact on Turkey\'s own 
economy was more muted than recent alarmist press statements 
led us to expect.   Noting that damage estimates are clearly 
exaggerated, Ersel quipped that they prompted him to wonder 
whether the U.S. was shifting its sights and planning to 
attack Turkey rather than Iraq.  Yarar too downplayed the 
issue, judging that \"the thought is worse than the reality.\" 
There was concern, however, particularly from market players 
that the perception that the U.S. and IMF would not permit 
Turkey to fail is creating a \"moral hazard\" and contributing 
to slippage on economic reform and fiscal discipline. 
 
 
8. (C) Comment: Gul\'s statement came late in our day of 
meetings and was only addressed by Bender analysts, who 
judged it positive but insufficient.  That view has largely 
been echoed over the last two days by other market analysts. 
But whatever the doubts about the specific figures (and there 
are many), there is at least relief that AK appears to have 
gotten the market\'s message at some level.  Whether the 
reform contingent is capable of building on that start 
remains to be seen.  Many in the markets have their doubts. 
End comment.

1. (SBU) On January 16, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew 
passed the Consul General a copy of a recent Ecumenical 
Patriarchate \"Notification on the Sacred Monastery of 
Esphigmenou.\"  The notification (see below) reiterates the 
Patriarchate\'s position on the long-standing dispute with the 
Esphigmenou Monastery (reftels).  Bartholomew did not offer 
any further comment on the issue. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Begin Text 
 
 
A Notification on the Sacred Monastery of Esphigmenou 
 
 
Religious freedom, which is internationally endorsed, 
stipulates that each organized religion or religious 
community determines the manner of receiving believers in its 
membership and the presuppositions for their inclusion and 
exclusion.  Furthermore, the administration of each religion 
has the jurisdictional right to specify the limits of 
operation of its religious houses and of the all other 
establishments of its worship.  It is self-evident and 
generally acceptable that the basic and indispensable 
presupposition of the use of places of worship (churches, 
monasteries, etc.) of a given religion is that whoever 
requests such as a usage should be a member of the given 
religion or religious community to which the particular place 
of worship belongs.  It is not possible for a Christian to 
\"demand\" to hold an act of worship of Christians in a Moslem 
mosque.  No Orthodox Christian or group of Orthodox 
Christians have the right to demand the use of a Roman 
Catholic place of worship, or a Lutheran one, etc.  Whether 
non-Orthodox churches or communities allow the use of their 
premises by the Orthodox is a matter that pertains to their 
absolute discretionary convenience.  In no case could these 
Orthodox accuse these churches of restricting their religious 
freedom by not allowing them to use places of worship that 
belong to them. 
 
 
The judgment of the highest authority of a religion 
concerning the deletion of certain ex-members from the 
registry of its active members is an internal matter (interna 
corporis) of this religion and cannot be questioned by other 
authorities.  A complaint that such a judgment curtails the 
religious freedom of those deleted is totally baseless, 
because their deletion does not deprive them of the right to 
believe whatever they wish and as they wish and to engage in 
their religious activities as they decide.  It only deprives 
them of the right to make use of places of worship of the 
religion from which they were deleted, because this is a 
self-evident consequence of their deletion. And, indeed, if 
they have in no way contributed to the construction of such 
places in question, they are certainly unable to evoke any 
proprietary or economic connection with them. 
 
 
In the case at hand, the Sacred Monastery of Esphigmenou on 
the Holy Mountain of Mt. Athos has a history of centuries and 
was not erected by those who have occupied it since 1972.  It 
belongs, as the entire Holy Mountain does, to the Orthodox 
Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate (of Constantinople). 
 By virtue of the explicit regulation of article 5 of the 
Constitutional Charter of the Holy Mountain and of article 
105 of the Constitution of the Greek State, \"schismatics and 
heterodox\" are not permitted to be residents on the Holy 
Mountain.  \"Schismatics\" are those who, although not 
differing in faith from the Ecumenical Patriarchate, refuse 
to be in ecclesiastical communion with the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate and also with the rest of the Orthodox Churches. 
 \"Heterodox\" are those who hold a different faith on a few or 
more points, such as the Protestants, the Roman Catholics, 
etc.  The special arrangement, which applies to the Holy 
Mountain for religious purposes, is recognized by the 
European Union as being in agreement with European Law.  This 
arrangement is attached to the Treaty of the entry of Greece 
into the European Economic Community and has ever since been 
recognized as being in force. 
 
 
The Ecumenical Patriarchate, exercising its spiritual 
jurisdiction, has characterized as schismatics the occupants 
of the Monastery of Esphigmenou, who since 1972 have cut-off 
relations with both the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the other 
Sacred Monasteries of the Holy Mountain.  A necessary 
consequence of this spiritual and jurisdictional judgment, 
which has taken the form of an official Patriarchal and 
Synodical decision, is that these occupants have no longer 
any right to reside on the Holy Mountain.  Indeed, their 
residence there is not based on any right of any other 
nature.  They did not erect the Sacred Monastery, nor do they 
have any right over it.  Their expulsion from the Holy 
Mountain does not offend their religious freedom to engage in 
religious activity as they wish.  It simply safeguards the 
freedom of the members of the Sacred Community of the Holy 
Mountain to have, according to teConsiutioa Chatr of 
the oly Mountain, 
-monastics who hare te samefaith nd 
ae of the sam mind nd admnistraively nited ith thm. 
or exaple, te condmned mnks ofEsphigenou dd not 
atted for ecadesthe hihest aministrative gatherings of 
he Holy Mountain, the 20-membered \"Sacred Community,\" 
because they did not wish to participate in the customary 
inaugural common prayer, established for centuries.  Besides, 
they refused to be in ecclesiastical and administrative 
communion with the rest of the Sacred Monasteries of the Holy 
Mountain and to participate in common activities of worship 
and governance of any nature. 
 
 
Consequently, the decision, taken after thirty years of 
patience, to characterize as schismatics the uncanonical 
occupants of the Sacred Monastery of Esphigmenou, which 
incurs their expulsion from the Holy Mountain, constitutes an 
obligatory action which has been issued in light of new, very 
recent and extremely injurious data.  This action protects 
the religious freedom of the Holy Mountain, without offending 
the religious freedom of those expelled from it, who can 
engage in their religious practices as they wish in any other 
place outside the Holy Mountain which has been for more than 
a millennium specifically allocated to Orthodox believers and 
not schismatics. 
 
 
In conclusion, the possible claims of the uncanonical 
occupants of the Sacred Monastery of Esphigmenou of the Holy 
Mountain that their characterization as schismatics and their 
consequent expulsion from the Holy Mountain is an assault on 
their religious freedom is baseless, because it does not 
restrict them from having any convictions and from practicing 
them anywhere else, except on the Holy Mountain.  The Holy 
Mountain has been for more than a millennium specifically 
assigned, in accordance with its current Constitutional 
Charter which is in force since 1924 and the Constitution of 
Greece, to Orthodox Christians alone, who recognize the 
spiritual jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the 
Patriarch over them, i.e. to those who are not schismatics.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EFIN, TU, Istanbul 
SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S JANUARY 14 EXCHANGES WITH ISTANBUL 
BUSINESS, ACADEMIC AND MEDIA LEADERS 
 
REF: ANKARA 392 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: In a series of January 14 discussions, the 
Ambassador reassured prominent Turkish businessmen, 
academics, and journalists that there is no crisis in 
U.S.-Turkish relations.   He outlined in general terms the 
USG-GOT discussions on Iraq, and made the case that the 
status quo in Iraq is detrimental to Turkey\'s long-term 
interests.  He criticized wildly inflated estimates of damage 
from an Iraq operation that have appeared in the Turkish 
media.   Ultimately, he said, the U.S. will accept whatever 
Turkey decides and plan accordingly, but the window for a 
Northern Flank option is narrowing rapidly.  His 
interlocutors made clear that the Iraq operation, and 
particularly the introduction of U.S. ground troops through 
Turkey, will be a tough sell, but that a UN mandate and 
broader European and Middle East support would aid the 
effort.  All three groups were critical of GOT Iraq policy, 
however, as contradictory, indecisive, and short on vision. 
And despite negative public opinion, all recognized that if a 
conflict is inevitable, Turkey\'s interests would be best 
served by cooperating with the anti-Iraq coalition.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) In each discussion, Ambassador stressed that despite 
sensationalist press stories, there is no crisis in 
U.S.-Turkish relations.  He expressed confidence that the two 
sides will reach a mutually acceptable arrangement on support 
for a U.S. operation.  Continuance of the status quo is 
clearly not in Turkey\'s interest, he argued, suggesting that 
there are clear benefits that would flow to Turkey from a 
regime change in its southern neighbor.  He challenged his 
interlocutors to think proactively about Turkey\'s future 
international role and to take a strategic, long-term 
approach to regional stability.  He also asked for support in 
calming fears about the potential impact on Turkey of an 
operation, noting that estimates of USD 100-140 billion in 
damage are wildly exaggerated.  The U.S., he stressed, is 
committed to providing aid that will effectively address the 
impact an operation might have on Turkey (leading investment 
houses estimate the impact at 4-15 billion USD).  The 
assistance numbers, while large, will not resonate unless 
current exaggerated public fears are addressed, he stressed. 
Ultimately, he said, the U.S. will accept Turkey\'s decision 
and plan accordingly, but the window for a Northern Flank 
option is narrowing rapidly. 
 
 
3. (C) According to the businessmen, academics, and 
journalists, the task of selling an operation to the Turkish 
public will be difficult: not only are over 80 percent of 
Turks opposed, but the newly-elected Justice and Development 
(AK) Party\'s base consists of the strongest opposition.  As 
Yeni Safak columnist Cengiz Candar put it, \"Given their 
mindset and upbringing, these guys never imagined that they 
might be the ones to invite U.S. troops into the region.\" 
While no one disputed the Ambassador\'s characterization of 
the damage estimates on the Turkish economy as \"inflated,\" 
some voiced skepticism about the USG\'s ability to shepherd a 
package through the Congress (the Ambassador remarked that 
early, whole-hearted Turkish cooperation would help make that 
task easier).  Most were somewhat critical of the AK 
government\'s recent indecision and mixed messages, pointing 
particularly to State Minister Tuzman\'s visit to Iraq and the 
failure to begin preparing public opinion for a decision to 
cooperate on Iraq.  Turkish conglomerate head Sakip Sabanci 
questioned the government\'s difficulty in choosing between 
its \"loyal\" ally in Washington and Baghdad and expressed 
whole-hearted support for TUSIAD President Ozilhan\'s January 
13 critique of the government (reftel).  In the end, most 
agreed that assuming a war is inevitable, Turkey will suffer 
economically whether it participates or not.  Personal views 
on Iraq aside (Bilgi University professor Soli Ozel opined 
that \"the U.S. has not yet made a case for a just war\"), 
Turkey will be best served by cooperating.   The consensus, 
however, was that another UNSCR and wide European and Middle 
East support will be crucial to getting Turkish support, 
although opening bases to U.S. ground troops may still be too 
tall an order for the AK government.

1.  (SBU) Summary: Leading Istanbul bankers and market 
analysts see current market sentiment as one of \"watchful 
waiting,\" but believe that despite recent declines in the 
stock market, there is an underlying expectation that the 
Turkish government will reach agreement with the IMF on the 
fourth review and with the U.S. on Iraq modalities.  Analysts 
concede that AK\'s \"learning curve has been expensive,\" and 
that the new government\'s economic policies remain Turkey\'s 
biggest risk (especially on bank sector reform), but they are 
betting at the end of the day on international recognition of 
Turkey\'s interests. End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Complacency and Watchful Waiting: In a round of 
separate meetings on January 22 and 23 with visiting Ankara 
DCM and Deputy Econ Counselor, financial and market analysts 
predicted that AK would \"stick with the program\" and not 
permit relations with either the IMF or United States to 
reach an impasse.  Citibank Country Risk Manager Peter 
Rossiter characterized the markets as complacent, and himself 
offered a relatively sanguine view of the government, arguing 
that it is not \"intentionally\" departing from the ongoing 
reform program, but instead has been hampered by its 
inexperience and lack of depth in its economic team.  He 
conceded that the government\'s lack of fiscal discipline is a 
serious concern, and that Citibank remains concerned about 
how Turkey will \"bridge the gaps\" that may occur as a result 
of an Iraq operation and its own fiscal policies, but noted 
that the bank\'s customers do not appear to share these 
worries.  \"The moral hazard of potential U.S. assistance is 
serious,\" he noted.  More generally, however, he saw 
fundamentals in Turkey moving in a positive direction, saying 
that Citibank\'s overall perspective is more positive than a 
year ago as a result of enhanced political stability, a 
stabilized banking system and companies that are \"earning 
their way out of the 2001 crisis.\" 
 
 
3. (SBU) Getting in on the Game: Pointing to the Treasury\'s 
successful January 22 auction, observers also drew attention 
to the reappearance of foreign investors in the market. 
While conceding that the core of the market remains the key 
banks that cannot afford to exit (given that T-bills make up 
35-40 percent of their assets), Bender analysts Murat Gulkan 
and Emin Ozturk attributed foreign demand to the success of 
last year\'s carry trade, where investors realized a 65-70 
percent return based on a relatively stable exchange rate. 
Morgan Stanley, they noted, had recently put out a paper on 
this issue. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Difficult Relations: While conceding that the agenda 
for completion of the much-delayed fourth review remains 
daunting, analysts were virtually unanimous that the market 
anticipates resolution of the outstanding issues.  Even 
Global\'s Cem Akyurek, traditionally a sceptic about the 
government, expects its completion, while analysts at TEB 
investment argue that the government has \"no choice\" but to 
reach a settlement.  Disbank\'s Tayfun Bayazit expects a 
satisfactory budget and abandonment of the most controversial 
proposed procurement law amendments, but sees the oustanding 
Pamukbank/Yapi Kredi problem as the key imponderable 
(reftel).  Beyond the January 31 deadline facing the banking 
board on that issue, all pointed to other key milestones 
including submission of the budget in late January. 
Observers agreed that the market expects the IMF to return by 
mid-February, and while some slippage may be allowed because 
of the upcoming holiday (the entire week of February 10), any 
delay beyond that point will damage market confidence. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Moral Hazard: Other banking and market analysts 
shared Citibank\'s belief that the expectation of U.S. 
assistance has created a moral hazard to one degree or 
another, and is encouraging the markets to look beyond such 
key issues as the sustainability of real interest rates. 
There was a general consensus from our interlocutors that the 
markets believe that the U.S. and IMF will take a more 
charitable view of Turkey\'s actions in the event of an Iraq 
operation.  We reiterated to all interlocutors that any U.S. 
assistance is conditioned not just on military cooperation 
but on continued economic reform. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: If markets are sanguine about the immediate 
future, there remains an underlying pessimism about Turkey\'s 
long-term prospects.  Akyurek, who has headed Global\'s 
research department for five years, argued that essentially 
\"AK doesn\'t understand the Washington consensus\" and remains 
Turkey\'s biggest risk.  The fact is especially frustrating, 
he argued, because Turkey \"doesn\'t need a lot for takeoff-- 
1-2 billion in FDI and 3-4 billion in loans would suffice.\" 
But for that to occur, Turkey needs 3 good years of \"flawless 
economic management.\"  In his view, and in that of most of 
those we talked to, while Turkey may get through the next few 
months, it is very unlikely to get to that take-off point. 
End Comment.

TOWARDS IRAQ 
 
 
REF: A. ISTANBUL 108 AND 114 
     B. ANKARA 549 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Widespread and increasingly vocal opposition 
to a possible war against Iraq is on the verge of evolving 
into a more general anti-American backlash in Istanbul.  Our 
observations, Istanbul contacts, and recent polls and surveys 
lead us to believe that anti-American sentiment is sharply 
rising in Istanbul.  \"sessiz Although much of this opposition is 
directed primarily at our policies in Iraq, the overall 
climate provides fertile ground for extremists hostile 
towards the United States.  Some leftist groups (including 
terrorist groups DHKP-C and KADEK) and the populist media 
tycoon and would-be politician Cem Uzan are seizing the 
opportunity to stir up trouble and rally support to their 
causes.  U.S. reassurances of its commitment to Iraq\'s 
territorial integrity and support for an economic assistance 
package are helping to address Turkish concerns.  However, 
sustained public diplomacy in Istanbul -- with 15% of the 
country\'s population and key opinion makers in media, higher 
education, and business -- remains critical to winning the 
Turkish public\'s support for our goals in Iraq.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) We have been following with concern the fervent and 
widespread opposition in Istanbul to U.S. policy in Iraq. 
Recent polls (E.G., the Pew Global Attitudes Project and 
local polls) affirm that up to 90% of Turks oppose U.S. 
military action against Iraq and that anti-American sentiment 
is on the rise in Turkey.  We have observed that Istanbul 
reflects those trends.  In recent months, ConGen Istanbul has 
consistently found Turks to be much more vocal and critical 
of U.S. policies towards Iraq and the Middle East.  \"No to 
War\" bumper stickers and placards have been plastered across 
the city, and the Consulate has received dozens of virulent, 
even threatening, anti-war letters. 
 
 
3. (C) The frequency and attendance of anti-war 
demonstrations have been steadily increasing over the last 
month.  In the largest demonstration so far, over 5000 
protesters gathered in Beyazit square on January 26 
brandishing placards reading \"Damn U.S. Imperialism\" and \"We 
Won\'t Be The U.S. Soldiers\" (ref A) (Note: Press reports 
indicate that there was a much larger demonstration in the 
southeastern city of Mersin on the same day.  End Note).  A 
meeting of over 2000 organizational representatives on 
January 25 was held in Istanbul to plan for even larger 
demonstrations in the coming weeks.  Demonstrators dumped a 
(presumably) American military uniform and boots on the steps 
of a prominent Turkish business association last week to 
protest the chairman\'s recent \"hawkish\" public remarks. 
Turkish police sources told us last week that they suspect 
that these demonstrations are being secretly sponsored by 
various anti-American leftist groups, including DHKP-C, MLKP 
(Marxist Leninist Communist Party), and KADEK (formerly the 
PKK) terrorist cells. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Others are also seizing the opportunity to fan the 
flames of anti-Americanism and gather personal support. 
Recent spurious allegations that the U.S. has had official 
contacts with KADEK/PKK in northern Iraq have received 
considerable Istanbul-based national press coverage (ref B). 
Additionally, media tycoon and Youth Party leader Cem Uzan 
has reached out to all of Istanbul (as well as the rest of 
Turkey) over the last week with an enormous anti-American 
media campaign  (Note: Uzan\'s Youth Party emerged just a few 
months before last year\'s November 3 elections and captured 
over 7 percent of the national vote with its anti-American, 
anti-Western populist rhetoric.  End Note).  Using print, 
radio, and television, Uzan has put out a well-crafted, 
populist, anti-war message under the title \"Who is the U.S. 
Attacking?\"  Uzan\'s message strikes popular chords by 
touching on themes like \"Turkey should make its own decision 
on war,\" \"The U.S. has not kept its promises to compensate 
Turkey for $100 billion in damages from the Gulf War,\" and 
\"Who will suffer from this anti-Muslim U.S. aggression?\"  Not 
content with using his private media outlets, Uzan has bought 
air and radio time as well as entire pages in all of the 
major newspapers.  Local staff tells us that this campaign is 
unprecedented in its coverage and cost. 
 
 
5. (U) All of this is troubling to Americans who know Turkey 
well.  Turkish hospitality is unstinting and Turkish-American 
friendship runs deep.  Additionally, U.S. \"soft power\" in 
Turkey appears alive and well. Turkey sends over 10,000 
students to study at American universities every year 
(placing it in the top ten countries worldwide).  Turkish 
television routinely features American programs (current fare 
includes Friends, Ally McBeal, Dawson\'s Creek, and NYPD Blue) 
in prime time network slots, and NBC and CNN also have 
popular local franchises.  American films dominate local 
theaters, and American pop music has made significant inroads 
in local radio programming.  U.S. products, from McDonald\'s 
and Coca-Cola to Ford automobiles and Boeing aircraft, are 
commonplace. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Nonetheless, our sense is that the reservoir of good 
will towards the United States is gradually being depleted. 
Simple opposition to U.S. policies (i.e. \"what we do\") among 
the large majority of Turks who are generally sympathetic to 
the U.S. is spilling over and contributing to the small core 
of anti-American Turks who dislike \"who we are.\"  The Pew 
Project found that only 31 percent of Turks had a positive 
view of \"Americans\" (versus 30 percent of the U.S.), 78 
percent viewed the spread of U.S. ideas and customs 
negatively, and 46 percent disliked American popular culture. 
 The timing and the discrepancy between the intensely 
pro-American mood in late 1999 and early 2000 (following 
former President Clinton\'s November 1999 visit to Turkey) and 
the generally pessimistic mood last summer during the waning 
months of the unpopular Ecevit government may have 
exaggerated these numbers.  But this cannot fully account for 
the sharp turn in public opinion against the United States 
that we observe in Istanbul. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Most Istanbul Turks continue to value the 
U.S.-Turkey strategic alliance and enjoy American products. 
Adversely affected by the ongoing economic crisis, however, 
many in this group mistakenly blame the IMF (and, by 
extension, the U.S.) for the country\'s crushing debt and the 
current strict economic program.  Initially sympathetic to 
the U.S.\'s war on terrorism, most of them have since come to 
believe that the operations directed against Afghanistan and, 
now, Iraq are heavy-handed personal American vendettas and 
perhaps even anti-Islamic in nature.  They feel that the U.S. 
has its priorities confused (i.e., Iraq before 
Israel/Palestine) and is bent on pursuing its goals 
unilaterally with little regard for international, and 
particularly Turkish, opinion. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: Our contacts in Istanbul, like embassy 
contacts elsewhere in the country, have never been fond of 
Saddam Hussein; most recognize that he represents a threat to 
regional stability, and many even admit that he probably does 
have biological and/or chemical weapons.  Nonetheless, there 
is a strong, widespread Turkish desire to preserve stability 
in the region - critical for Turkey\'s economic and political 
development.  Much of the opposition to an operation against 
Iraq rests with our contacts\' pessimistic predictions of the 
duration of hostilities, an unstable post-war power vacuum, 
and the possible disintegration of the Iraqi state into 
several components, including a Kurdish north.  CONGEN 
reassurances -- that we would prefer a peaceful solution to 
war, that we will continue to seek wide international support 
for any necessary military operation, that we are committed 
to Iraqi territorial integrity and long-term regional 
stability, and that we are prepared to help Turkey weather 
the negative economic shocks of a war -- have gone a long way 
towards addressing these concerns.  Continued multilateral 
diplomacy and public diplomacy efforts to address these basic 
concerns will be critical to winning the Turkish public\'s 
support for our goals in Iraq.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: PROTESTANTS TRY ADAPTIVE APPROACH TO CHURCH 
ESTABLISHMENT 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Seventeen nascent Protestant churches have 
adopted a novel legal tactic designed to circumvent 
regulations that for years have made it nearly impossible to 
receive zoning approval for a church or prayer group.  The 
success or failure of this strategy depends on the outcome of 
the churches\' attempts to win legal recognition in a series 
of ongoing court cases. End Summary. 
 
 
-------------- 
In Legal Limbo 
-------------- 
 
 
2. (SBU) Poloff recently met with Attorney Mustafa Demir, who 
represents most of the American Protestant groups in 
Istanbul, including a total of 22 churches and one 
now-defunct school (Martyn International Academy).  In past 
meetings, Demir and Amcit Protestant leader George Bristow 
expressed their frustration at not being able to open a 
church under Turkish law.  In fact, Demir said, there 
is no provision in Turkish law, either positive or negative, 
for the establishment of a new church.  Requests for a 
building to be zoned as a church are typically ignored or 
refused. 
 
 
3. (SBU) For these reasons, Protestant groups often give up 
trying to establish churches within any legal framework, 
instead opting for informal arrangements, converting shops or 
apartments into places of worship, and hoping that the 
unregistered church will go unnoticed.  This approach 
typically works for a time, but in a matter of months police 
take notice, or neighbors complain, and the informal church 
is shut down, the leaders often charged with zoning 
violations. 
 
 
------------------------ 
The Mosque-like Approach 
------------------------ 
 
 
4. (SBU) Ironically, most Turkish mosques similarly inhabit a 
legal no-man,s-land, in that they too usually lack zoning 
permission.  Upon completion of a new mosque, the leadership 
applies for benefits that, according to Turkish law, are 
given to all religious institutions: free water, electricity, 
gas, trash collection, and so forth. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Demir sees provision of these services as a means to 
secure legal recognition without the zoning issue face-off. 
He has advised his clients first to buy, lease, or renovate 
the property they wish to use as a church.  Then, the church 
requests provision of municipal services that all religious 
institutions are entitled to.  Also, the church notifies the 
local police that they have some security concerns, and 
requests police protection.  Finally, if GoT authorities warn 
the churches of their lack of a zoning permit, they file a 
counter-suit asking for legal recognition from the state, 
claiming that the utilities and police protection constitute 
evidence of their recognized status in a manner similar to 
any mosque. 
 
 
6. (SBU) To date, 17 churches have initiated cases seeking 
such legal recognition.  Of the 17, three have had initial 
rulings: one finding in favor of the church, one against 
(stating that the church was not a legal entity and thus 
could not bring suit against the state), and one which has 
been postponed for further examination.  Demir hopes that if 
the one positive ruling stands on appeal, it can be used as 
precedent to buttress the claims of the other churches. 
 
 
---------------------- 
Under Another Umbrella 
---------------------- 
 
 
7. (SBU) The same group of Istanbul Protestant churches had 
previously run up against difficulties in running an 
unregistered school, the Martyn International Academy (MIA). 
Though the case is still pending, the board members of the 
now-defunct school admitted to breaking Turkish law in the 
operation of an unlicensed educational institution (see 
reftel). 
 
 
8. (SBU) In a similarly pragmatic manner, MIA has found a 
means to re-open in another location on the Asian side of 
Istanbul, under the auspices of the newly opened Istanbul 
International School of Camlica.  The school has already been 
registered, and the former MIA students and faculty have been 
added on as the \"English Language Section\" of a school that 
also offers instruction in Turkish and Korean.  200 former 
MIA students have thus been able to attend classes under the 
new school,s name. 
 
 
9. (SBU) Comment: Having exhausted their earlier strategies 
of normal application, and quiet evasion, Demir and Bristow 
hope that their new \"adaptation\" strategy will prove more 
fruitful.  Final resolution of the ongoing cases will soon 
show whether or not their hopes are misplaced.  End Comment.

ORGANIZATIONS 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: Istanbul, Turkey\'s economic, commercial 
and cultural capital, hosts a rich diversity of business 
voices, all seeking to influence both government policy and 
international perceptions of Turkey.  Leader of the pack is 
the venerable TUSIAD-- Turkish Industrialists and 
Businessmen\'s Association-- now in its fourth decade, which 
has won widespread respect (and occasional government pique) 
for its cogent policy critiques.  In recent years, a host of 
other organizations has emerged.  Tellingly, for a country 
and society still grappling with the proper boundaries of 
religion and a secular order, many of them are more avowedly 
religious.  Young business leaders have also stepped forward, 
establishing groups to encourage entrepreneurship and to 
enable them to step out from their elders\' shadow.  End 
Sumary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Running the gamut: Business associations in Istanbul 
come in a wide variety, beginning with those quasi-public 
organizations used to organize the business sector, 
continuing on to mixed organizations which seek to advance 
such national goals as international trade and exports, to 
the purely private and voluntary organizations that now crowd 
the city scene.  Numerically, quasi-public organizations, and 
particularly the local Chambers of Commerce and Industry, 
still hold pride of place.  But given that membership is 
compulsory (in that it is necessary for registration as a new 
business entity), they have tended to have less of a lobbying 
role.  Only in recent years has the umbrella (and 
Ankara-based) Union of Chambers of Commerce (TOBB) begun to 
make its voice heard.  Similarly, mixed organizations (such 
as the Foreign Economic Relations Board and its affiliated 
business councils) have focused on specific policy goals and 
remained relatively uncontroversial.  Not so the private 
organizations.  As exemplified by TUSIAD\'s recent 
confrontation with the Gul government over both Iraq policy 
and pursuit of economic reform, they have waded into the 
thick of policy debates, and played an important role in 
national politics.  Their importance is not new (some ascribe 
the fall of one of Bulent Ecevit\'s early governments in the 
late 1970s to TUSIAD\'s opposition).  But in an environment 
where many perceive a lack of (or lackluster) political 
opposition, they have assumed increasing importance.  \"The 
markets are the government\'s opposition,\" one leading 
investment analyst told us recently, and by extension these 
organizations play a similar role.  Inspired by TUSIAD\'s 
success, the range of organizations has widened dramatically 
in the last decade, and now encompasses \"young\" business 
leaders, \"independent\" business leaders, and more avowedly 
\"religious\" business leaders. 
 
 
3. (SBU) The Heavyweight-- TUSIAD: If it has spawned a slew 
of imitators, until TOBB recently began to take a more active 
role, TUSIAD has had no serious challenger for the title of 
Turkey\'s most influential business association.  Founded in 
1971, its 471 members represent over 1300 of Turkey\'s largest 
companies, producing 47 percent of the value added in Turkish 
production and a similar percentage of Turkey\'s exports.  As 
the numbers suggest, these members include the country\'s 
largest industrial holdings.  Past chairmen have included a 
number of Kocs and Sabancis, and other members of Turkey\'s 
most exclusive business elite.  Once known as the \"Bosphorus 
Billionaires\' Club,\" the organization has evolved with the 
times, incorporating both representatives of foreign 
companies and the professional managers who have assumed the 
reins of many Turkish companies from their original founders. 
 Currently headed by Tuncay Ozilhan, who recently reluctantly 
agreed to extend his two-year tenure for a third year, TUSIAD 
eschews partisanship but is politically active in lobbying 
for business interests.  Recently it has focused on full 
implementation of Turkey\'s ongoing economic reform program 
and advancement of Turkey\'s candidacy for EU membership. 
Based in Istanbul, the organization maintains permanent 
offices in Brussels and Washington. 
 
 
4. (SBU) While non-partisan, TUSIAD does not pull its 
punches, as Ozilhan\'s mid-January critique of government 
policy on both Iraq and reform showed.  Though both sides 
drew back from confrontation (and privately many TUSIAD 
members argue the media blew the dispute up out of 
proportion), Ozilhan succeeded in laying down a clear marker 
of the importance to Turkey\'s business community of both 
continued economic reform and cooperation with the U.S. 
Beyond its policy advocacy in Ankara and abroad (before 
Copenhagen, TUSIAD delegations inundated European capitals), 
TUSIAD also publishes academic and other papers on essential 
political and economc issues.  A recent study on inflation 
and growth dynamics, for instance, highlighted the economic 
cost of the macro instability Turkey has experienced in 
recent decades. 
 
 
5. (SBU) The Flatterers-- MUSIAD: If imitation is the 
sincerest form of flattery, TUSIAD has many admirers.  Its 
success has spawned a slew of similar groups, though 
organized around different operating principles.  Chief among 
these groups is the Independent Industrialists\' and 
Businessmen\'s Association (MUSIAD), which groups many 
mid-rank companies, and is known for more of a \"Muslim\" 
identity.  Founded in 1990, it currently has 3000 members, 
divided among 30 branches throughout the country.  It 
organizes regular international and local trade fairs and 
trade missions, providing a key mechanism for companies that 
are new to international markets to make a first foray into 
them.  A less developed and structured organization than 
TUSIAD, it consequently relies more on its leadership and its 
views.  The current MUSIAD President, Ali Bayramoglu, has 
adopted a high public profile, commenting on pending economic 
and political issues.  Reflecting his constituency, however, 
he has been less inclined to support the IMF consensus, and 
more given to advocate populist measures.  Given a congruence 
of views, MUSIAD has close ties with the AK party, and a 
dozen organization members were elected to parliament in the 
November elections. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Other groups include the Young Entrepreneurs 
Association (GYIAD) and the Young Turkish Businessmen\'s 
Association (TUGIAD), which both group the younger generation 
of Turkish entrepreneurs.  Both groups have participated in 
USG-organized programs, as has the Business Life Cooperation 
Association (ISHAD).  The latter has taken part in several 
trade missions to the United States, as well as a Public 
Affairs organized Voluntary Visitor Program.  Like Musiad, 
its members come from small to medium-sized enterprises and 
are  Islamic influenced, though they follow modern business 
practices, and do not circumscribe their business activities 
for religious reasons. 
 
 
7. (SBU) The Specialist-- YASED: While TUSIAD effectively 
represents Turkey\'s largest economic actors, over the last 
quarter-century the Foreign Investors Association (YASED) has 
been similarly active in promoting the interests of foreign 
companies in Turkey.  With 315 members representing 211 
companies, YASED has fought to improve Turkey\'s business 
environment, focusing both on streamlining the torturous 
procedures for approval of foreign investments and assisting 
its members in their dealings with the Turkish government and 
regulatory bodies.  Reorganized in 1998, YASED developed a 
committee system to address specific sectoral and regulatory 
needs.  It has played a leading role in efforts to draft a 
new investment code and associated regulations and thereby 
improve the investment climate in Turkey.  In a recent 
meeting it reported significant progress, noting that while 
serious issues remained, Turkey\'s new AK government has 
proved much more receptive to its proposals than were its 
predecessors.  (septel). 
 
 
8. (SBU) The Hybrid-- DEIK: If most Turkish business 
organizations are private, the current key actor in 
developing and encouraging international trade had a mixed 
character at its outset.  In its early years the Foreign 
Economic Relations Board (DEIK) received state funding, from 
which it has now graduated.  Instead it is financed 
exclusively by its members and founding organizations, which 
include TUSIAD and TOBB (TOBB\'s Chairman is always the 
titular head of DEIK).   DEIK seeks to encourage 
international trade through bilateral business councils with 
Turkey\'s leading trade partners.  The current 66 councils 
include 1134 representatives of 478 companies.  Generally, 
participating companies have undertaken business activity 
with the target country, or plan to do so.  DEIK essentially 
acts as an intermediary between the public and private 
sectors, due to its close working relations with both 
government bodies and private sector institutions in Turkey. 
It aims to encourage business development, to improve 
conditions for bilateral trade, and to provide a forum for 
delibersations on new avenues and forms of bilateral and 
multilateral cooperation. 
 
 
9. (SBU) TUSBC: For the U.S., the key subset of DEIK (and the 
first council formed) is the Turkish-U.S. Business Council, 
which functions as the counterpart to the American Turkish 
Council (ATC).  Founded in 1985, at the personal urging of 
Turgut Ozal, TUSBC currently has around 100 members.  In 
addition to the major international Washington Conference it 
organizes each March with the ATC, TUSBC also organizes other 
programs, including investment and business seminars 
throughout the U.S. and Turkey visits for American business 
and political leaders.  At its 2003 meeting, it adopted an 
action plan to further strengthen its activities by creating 
a consulting center and reinvigorating its sectoral 
committees. 
 
 
10. (SBU) TABA Amcham: While TUSBC is the American-Turkish 
Council\'s counterpart, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\'s 
officially certified partner is the Turkish-American Business 
Association (TABA), which was founded at almost the same time 
(1986).  Currently boasting 1000 (mostly Turkish) members in 
7 chapters throughout the country, TABA has also sought to 
enhance business relations and promote investment between the 
two countries.  It has also focused in particular on 
encouraging cooperation in the Caucasus region.  It focuses 
on five sectors-- energy, telecommunication, transportation, 
tourism, and environmental protection-- but has generally 
been less active than its DEIK-affiliated counterpart. 
Recognizing the complications and difficulties resulting from 
the bifurcated organizational structure of Turkish-U.S. 
business relations, some TABA members have recently 
encouraged greater cooperation with TUSBC. 
 
 
11. (SBU) Comment: Istanbul\'s diversity of business voices 
provides a valuable resource to the Consulate, both in 
seeking to advance U.S. business interests and in gleaning 
business attitudes to issues of the day.  However, the 
multiplicity of voices can also be confusing, and the mission 
has encouraged greater unity and cooperation among the 
various organizations. Turkey\'s major independent policy 
voices seem determined to use their influence to fill the 
void left by the perceived absence of an effective opposition 
to the majority AK government.  While both sides will no 
doubt try to avoid the heated clash of mid-February, there is 
no doubt that TUSIAD and its counterparts will continue to 
push their message at every opportunity.  End Comment.

Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL DAVID ARNETT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: The General Directorate for Foundations 
recently enacted regulations that were expected to allow 
community (i.e. non-Muslim religious) foundations to reclaim 
seized properties.  The new regulations are part of the 
EU-harmonization reforms aimed at enhancing religious 
minority rights and, it was hoped, allowing foundations to 
reclaim seized properties.  Reaction from non-Muslim 
community leaders ranged from outrage to indifference to 
near-contentment, depending upon a community\'s reading of the 
regulations and the amount of each community\'s disputed 
property.  However, one fact is unquestioned: property 
acquisition and registration remains squarely in the 
unsupervised hands of the General Directorate for 
Foundations, the very body accused of appropriating many of 
the properties to begin with.  End Summary. 
 
 
------------------- 
THE NEW REGULATIONS 
------------------- 
 
 
2. (U)  The new regulations, published in the Official 
Gazette January 24, address three different issues: how 
community foundations can acquire property, how they may use 
such property, and how they may register \"property already at 
their disposal\" (i.e. occupied but unregistered property). 
Each portion of the regulation has its own ambiguities and 
legal complexities. 
 
 
3. (U) In the case of acquisition, it is unclear whether 
newer religious community foundations, not currently on the 
list, will be allowed to acquire further property as their 
community grows.  In the case of older communities with 
shrinking populations, it is not clear if they will have the 
option of acquiring new properties at all, as they will have 
to explain, even if the property is willed or donated, what 
\"religious, charitable, social, educational, cultural, and 
health needs\" the new property will meet.  The Ecumenical 
Patriarchate and other communities with rapidly dwindling 
populations fear that the General Directorate for 
Foundations, the arbiter of whether the property may be 
acquired, will deny them the inheritance, saying their needs 
are already met by current properties. 
 
 
4. (U) In the case of disposition of property already owned 
and properly registered, the foundations are allowed to 
\"exercise their power of disposition of the property\" in 
order to meet the needs listed above.  However, \"the exercise 
of real rights shall be subject to the permission of the 
General Directorate for Foundations.\"  Thus, rental or sale 
of an existing property is not an unsupervised right. 
 
 
5. (U) In the case of registration of currently owned 
property, the regulation seems to preclude the possibility of 
restitution for properties seized by the GoT between 1935 and 
the present.  Though the regulation is generous as to what 
documents can be used to buttress an application for 
registration (including utility bills, Ottoman deeds and 
registries, and unapproved deed inspection records), the 
caveat that the property must be \"under the disposal of the 
foundation\" suggests that only property with documentation 
problems, rather than property expropriated by the State, 
will be covered under the law.  Thus, one major point it was 
hoped the new law would ameliorate is not addressed by the 
regulation. 
 
 
----------------- 
GENERAL REACTIONS 
----------------- 
 
 
6. (U)  Poloff spoke with representatives of all major 
communities affected by the new regulations (the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate, Armenian Orthodox Patriarchate, Suriyani 
Orthodox Metropolitan, Jewish Community, and Chaldean 
Catholics).  Since the law is written specifically for 
community foundations, the list of relevant groups was 
appended to the regulation, though there is no mention of 
what inclusion on the list of 160 foundations means.  Whether 
or not these are the only parties who can make use of the law 
is unclear.  The portion of the law related to registration 
of currently owned property covers the years 1935 to present 
(and the list of foundations is roughly accurate for those 
registered in 1936).  However, it is unclear if newer 
foundations, such as the Istanbul Protestant Church 
Foundation, can make use of the new \"acquisition\" regulations 
or not, as they were not listed in the appendix. 
7. (U) Of the total 160 foundations listed, the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate has 74.  The Armenian Orthodox Patriarchate has 
34 foundations.  The Jewish Community has 18, Suriyanis 6, 
and Chaldean Catholics 3. 
 
 
8. (C) Reactions to the regulation diverge widely. 
Metropolitan Meliton of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, who has 
principal responsibility for property issues, argues the 
regulations are \"one step forward, three steps back,\" in that 
they fail to recognize or give status to the Patriarchate, 
split Halki into two foundations, and make no provision for 
the re-acquisition of expropriated property.  Armenian 
Orthodox, Suriyani and Chaldean Catholic churches are also 
pessimistic about the regulations\' limitations to varying 
degrees, but suggest that the law may open some possibilities 
for normalization of unresolved property problems and new 
property acquisition.  Finally, the Jewish Community is most 
optimistic, seeing no new problems created by the law, and 
some utility in the registration process.  Except for the 
Armenians and Greeks, all the communities with which post met 
agreed that the appended foundation list was complete. 
 
 
----------------- 
SPECIFIC CONCERNS 
----------------- 
 
 
9. (C) \"A Patriarch is not a Foundation\": Greek and Armenian 
Orthodox churches hold that their patriarchs, and the 
immediate facilities in which they reside and work, are not 
foundations, but simply patriarchates.  As such, they should 
be allowed to own and acquire property, as well as register 
the property they now inhabit, in their own right (in both 
cases, the patriarchates do not have any legal status or 
deed, despite centuries of residence).  Unlike the 
Hahamhanesi (Chief Rabbinate), they have no established 
foundation for the patriarchate itself, and argue that a 
foundation is unacceptable because the patriarch alone 
decides how the property should be administered, not a 
committee (as is required in the law governing foundations). 
This political and semantic fight prevents both parties from 
coming to a modus vivendi with the GoT under the new 
regulations, and continues a decades-old stand-off over what, 
exactly, a patriarch is under Turkish law. 
 
 
10. (C) \"Applying to the Thief\": Greek and Armenian Orthodox 
and Chaldean Catholic churches all see restitution of 
expropriated property as impossible under this law.  Legal 
problems \"created\" (in their terms) by the GoT in the 
thirties prevented non-Muslim communities from either 
registering properties or forming their own foundations. 
Accordingly, over the course of the next 60 years, their 
properties were taken over by the General Directorate of 
Foundations.  No mention is made in the regulation of how to 
apply for restitution of properties which were seized, only 
how to register properties which are still in the 
communities\' possession, but lack proper documentation. 
Though all concede that the law technically could be 
interpreted to allow for some form of restitution, such an 
application must be approved by the General Directorate for 
Foundations, the very body which took the properties to begin 
with.  In the words of Fr. Francois Yakan of the Chaldean 
Catholic Church, \"that would be like applying to the thief to 
get your wallet back.\" 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
11. (C) The regulations fall well short of providing a 
transparent and efficient means to reconcile property 
seizures that the GoT itself recognizes were unlawful. 
Normalization of the status of property already in the hands 
of the foundations demands a willingness on the part of the 
foundation to accommodate to the General Directorate\'s 
willful interpretations of the law.  The Jewish Community 
long ago elected to accommodate itself.  The Greek and 
Armenian Orthodox churches continue to hold their political 
ground in the interests of establishing a transparent and 
reliable approach on the part of the General Directorate. 
End comment.

REF: ISTANBUL 225 
 
 
Classified By: CG David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  In a country that recent polls show is 
approximately 94 percent against a war in Iraq, one would 
expect its largest city to have seen its share of large 
anti-war demonstrations.  Despite a populace that holds views 
more squarely anti-war than London, Paris or New York, to 
date protest organizers have not been able to attract more 
than 5,000-8,000 of Istanbul\'s 12 million residents.  The 
reasons for this lie in Turkey\'s fragmented civil society; 
police and security attitudes; and harsh winter weather.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------ 
WHOSE RALLY IS IT? 
------------------ 
 
 
2. (C) The average Istanbul resident is strongly anti-war. 
But, before attending a rally against the war, most likely he 
or she will ask who is organizing it, and who is likely to 
attend.  The possibility of a rally being &hijacked8 by, or 
accused of collaboration with, more radical groups is a 
powerful disincentive to participation.  In a February 15 
protest in Kadikoy, an initially peaceful protest became a 
small-scale riot, involving Molotov cocktail throwing and the 
arrest of approximately 60 alleged members of the 
outlawed Kurdish PKK/KADEK organization.  Turkish citizens\' 
desire to avoid trouble and distance themselves from 
accusations of sympathy with some radical groups provide a 
strong reason to stay home. 
 
 
3. (C) Across the spectrum, political parties and NGOs have 
held anti-war functions, but often seek to use the theme to 
further their own ends.  If someone isn\'t a die-hard Saadet 
Partisi supporter, for example, he probably doesn\'t want to 
attend their rally, regardless of how he feels about the 
anti-war theme.  Perhaps recognizing how difficult it has 
been to bring out the crowds, the organizers of a February 22 
anti-war meeting billed their gathering as an academic 
conference rather than a rally.  Poloff noted that 
the rally-style speeches and rhetoric fell somewhat flat on a 
sedate audience of approximately 150 journalists, academics, 
and students. 
 
 
--------------------- 
THE HEAVY HAND OF LAW 
--------------------- 
 
 
4. (C) More senior police commanders remember well the nearly 
all-engulfing riots that paralyzed Istanbul in the late 
1970s.  As a result, police are rarely out-manned at 
political rallies.  In the case of openly announced 
demonstrations, the police often arrive several hours in 
advance, parking buses full of police throughout the area. 
When a rally\'s organizers do not notify the police 
(tantamount to requesting permission), reaction from the 
authorities can be more severe.  In recent protests near 
Galatasaray Lisesi (about a half mile from the Consulate 
General) on February 19, police buses were backed up for 
several blocks.  Two weeks prior, a protest planned for the 
Abide-i Hurriyet Park in Sisli had hundreds of police filling 
the location more than 3 hours in advance, with fewer 
protesters than police showing up, partially due to rain. 
 
 
5. (C) Our contacts also note that, at a typical rally, many 
plain-clothes policemen permeate the crowd, and also 
videotape the event.  The fact that taped speeches by 
pro-Islamist politicians have been leaked by the security 
establishment to the press in the past, often to discredit 
the politicians\' claims of moderation, seems to support this 
thesis.  When coupled with a general lack of civic activism 
in Turkish society, efforts to avoid conflict with the police 
(and possible subsequent detention) provide a second powerful 
reason not to take to the streets. 
 
 
6. (C) One final factor reducing the size of possible 
protests is the fact that Turkey\'s AK Parti government has 
echoed the public\'s general anti-war sentiment in its 
statements and policies.  If parliament (as is expected) 
passes a resolution later this week allowing U.S. troops to 
transit Turkish territory, anti-war activists may take to the 
streets to protest their government\'s &disconnect8 with the 
public. 
 
 
------------- 
RAIN AND SNOW 
------------- 
 
 
7. (U) Another important consideration is that the weather 
has been almost unceasingly bad for the last three weeks. 
Considerable rain and snow have kept Turks at home across the 
board, with enclosed shopping malls the only significant 
crowded locations.  Protests are unlikely to draw any large 
numbers, no matter how heated the opposition, until the 
weather improves. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
8. (C)  With a government echoing many of the public\'s 
anti-war arguments, even as it negotiates with the U.S. over 
troop transit, rally participation may have seemed 
unnecessary.  With the submission of a request to parliament 
for authorization of U.S. troop transit, that dynamic could 
change.  END COMMENT.

1.  (SBU) Summary: With Turkey\'s new AK government just 
having marked its hundredth day in office, representatives of 
American pharmaceutical companies indicate they have not yet 
judged the time ripe to raise the intellectual property and 
pricing issues that have beset them in recent years.  Despite 
this, they see some grounds for hope.  Eli Lilly Managing 
Director Roberto Giusti argues that in contrast to its more 
\"nationalistic\" predecessor, the current government\'s 
intentions are good, though it has little concept of the 
scale of the issues confronting it in the pharmaceutical 
area.  Giusti argued that advancement of U.S. pharmaceutical 
interests remains hampered by continued divisions within the 
industry.  Differences over the relative weight accorded to 
such issues as prolonging the reimbursement lifecycle of 
older off-patent brands has divided such industry leaders as 
Eli Lilly and Pfizer, with the former joining with 
like-minded companies to form a new \"Association of Research 
Based Pharmaceutical Companies\" (AIFD) in January.  Now 
completing its registration procedures, the group will make 
an introductory foray into Ankara later this week. 
Meanwhile, Giusti encouraged the USG to continue to host 
regular gatherings of the industry, noting that outside these 
sessions \"there is very little dialogue.\"  End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (SBU) A New Association: In a February 27 meeting with 
P/E Chief and Commercial Specialist, Eli Lilly General 
Manager Roberto Giusti (joined midway through the meeting by 
Akzo Nobel General Manager Edward Lysen) outlined the goals 
of the new research-based association (of which he is Vice 
President).  (Note: The Group\'s ten members make up 20 
percent of the sector, accounting for a significant 190 
million USD in investment in Turkey in the past two years. 
End Note.) They stressed that neither IEIS (the Drug 
Manufacturers Employers\' Association) nor TISD (the Turkish 
Drug Manufacturers\' Association) makes representation of 
innovation or of research-based interests their top priority, 
and that AIFD aims to fill that gap.  Pointing to \"big 
picture\" in Turkish healthcare expenditure, Giusti argued 
that while the total is deficient (closer to that of Bulgaria 
than that of Greece), it is also seriously skewed.  Much of 
it, he suggested, is a \"subsidy\" to domestic industry, in 
that while imported drugs routinely face price 
discrimination, Turkish manufacturers receive reimbursement 
far above comparable world prices for their \"copy drugs\" (or 
generics).  As a result, cost containment (encouraged by the 
IMF) has targeted new and innovative products, resulting in 
price discrimination against them.  (Thus, vitamins, e.g., 
are subsidized, while new cancer drugs are not.)  Giusti 
stressed that the new association is not overtly seeking an 
end to the subsidies, nor to the reimbursement lifecycle 
issues on which he suggested Pfizer is focused.  Rather the 
group believes these \"business interests\" should be lower 
priorities than the industry\'s \"legitimate entitlements\": 
full implementation of intellectual property rights and the 
discontinuation of disciminatory practices against imports. 
In Giusti\'s view, the defensibility of the \"local subsidy\" or 
reimbursement lifecycle is not the key issue; rather the 
issue is their \"inappropriateness\" at a time when data 
exclusivity is not provided and when price discrimination 
continues to exist. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Continued Differences: Giusti noted that the 
association\'s members are not exclusively foreign, but 
include three Turkish research-based firms.  Founding 
companies include Novartis, Sering AG, Novo, Bayer, Solvay, 
Lundbeck Astrazeneca, Sanofi-Synthelabo, Organon and Lilly. 
Outside the new organization are those with \"other 
interests\": generic manufacturers, with their vested interest 
in the current reimbursement system, and Pfizer.  (In a 
separate meeting with Pfizer\'s Pricing Director Feyza Tevruz 
earlier in the month, these differences were only indirectly 
touched upon, with Tevruz noting that Pfizer did not share 
all of Giusti\'s criticism of the reimbursement system: while 
it agreed the system was \"not perfect,\" it could live with 
it.)  Giusti also expressed frustration with the lack of 
transparency in the GOT\'s reimbursement decisions, suggesting 
that some other foreign firms had benefited from their access 
to decisionmakers to win special breaks.  Part of the 
problem, he suggested, is a lack of communication within the 
industry, and he encouraged the USG to hold pharmaceutical 
roundtables (like that of late November at the Consulate) on 
a more regular basis.  Lysen echoed the point, noting that in 
his past assignment, roundtables hosted by Embassy Tokyo had 
been extremely helpful in keeping the industry informed about 
developments and on the same page in their advocacy efforts. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Still too Early: Giusti and Lysen echoed what Tevruz 
and Pharmacia-Upjohn Country Director Muhittin Bilutay 
suggested earlier in the month: the time is only now becoming 
ripe to press the new Minister of Health on the data 
exclusivity and price discrimination issues, particularly 
given staff changes in the Ministry.  Giusti was hopeful that 
the new government would be more open to the industry\'s 
position than its predecessor.  The Ecevit government, he 
argued, saw issues through a \"nationalistic\" prism and was 
predisposed to back domestic industry at the expense of its 
foreign counterparts.  That may not be true of AK: he 
suggested that the government\'s intentions are \"good,\" but 
that it is not aware of the extent of things that need to be 
changed.  Giusti said he will make an initial trip to Ankara 
this week to introduce the new association and distribute the 
new issue paper it has prepared (copy e-mailed to desk and 
Embassy Ankara).  Bilgutay similarly indicated that the 
industry is just now beginning to raise the price issues that 
have seriously harmed it in Ankara.  The Import subcommittee 
of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA) planned 
to meet with the Health Ministry\'s new Director General of 
Pharmaceuticals in mid-February to raise its concerns about 
import pricing, and to determine whether she planned to 
adhere to the action plan her predecessor had adopted to 
address the issue.  Bilgutay stressed the seriousness of the 
situation, noting that regulations that had cut the companies 
margins on imports from 36 to 16 percent (10 percent profit 
and 6 percent cost), when coupled with inflation and lags in 
reimbursement cycles, had seriously harmed the industry. 
 
 
5. (SBU) A Tender Trap?: Bilgutey also flagged his concern 
that new tender regulations may apply to purchase of 
pharmaceutical products, putting further downward pressure on 
already low reimbursement prices.  Neither Giusti or Tevruz 
raised this issue, however. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: Serious divisions persist among U.S. and 
other international companies active in the Turkish market, 
though there is underlying agreement that intellectual 
property issues need to be addressed, as is reflected in 
PhRMA\'s latest submission.  Given the positive feedback on 
the roundtable Mission organized in November (the third in 
the past year), we will seek to organize such sessions on a 
regular basis, though perhaps not quite as often as the 
monthly session Giusti suggested.  A goal at some of these 
sessions would also be to encourage dialogue between American 
and Turkish pharmaceutical companies, something the 
American-Turkish Council has also attempted to organize.  End 
Comment.

1. (SBU) Summary:  Istanbul market analysts are grappling 
with the new political landscape following Saturday\'s 
parliamentary vote against permitting U.S. troops.  The 
development was a shock: despite difficulties in 
negotiations, the market had long assumed (and priced in) a 
positive outcome.   While some observers still hold out hope 
a second vote will be held after AK deputies take in the 
market consequences of their action, others are less 
sanguine.  All agree that what is required now is renewed 
commitment to the IMF program.  Prime Minister Gul\'s 
pre-market opening announcement of agreement on the 2003 
budget with the IMF is being taken as a sign that he 
understands this reality.  Some doubt whether such a policy 
is sustainable in the medium term, however, as a war\'s 
contractionary impact hits home.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) A Jaw-dropping Surprise: Saturday\'s decision was a 
shock to the market, which despite tough rhetoric had never 
really doubted that at the end of the day Turkey would hew to 
its strategic partnership with the U.S. and recognize the 
important role a U.S. package could play in counterbalancing 
an Iraq operation\'s economic impact.  As J.P. Morgan\'s Koray 
Arikan commented Saturday night after the vote, \"the markets 
had priced in the deal, and viewed the parliamentary process 
as cosmetics.\"  Indeed, at the range of brokerages we 
canvassed last week there was little doubt that approval 
would come, and more interest in the mechanics of how the 
U.S. assistance (which all saw as critical to the 
sustainability of Turkey\'s debt) would function. 
 
 
3. (SBU) A Silver Lining: Coupled with concern about how 
Turkey will cover its financing gap without assistance, 
however, some analysts see a hint of a silver lining.  If 
previously there was a perception that the government was 
stalling in its negotiations with the IMF in anticipation of 
completion of the U.S. assistance package, there is now 
belief that the government has put itself at the mercy of the 
IMF, and has no choice but to accept its conditions without 
exception.  ATA Invest Board Member Mehmet Sami and Chief 
Economist Altug Karamenderes told us on March 3 that 
continuance of the IMF program, not \"temporary\" U.S. 
assistance, remains the most important issue for investors. 
The two saw in Prime Minister Gul\'s morning press conference 
an indication that he understood this reality, and believe 
that indications of progress on the IMF agreement will help 
blunt the vote\'s negative impact on Turkish markets. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Sustainability: Both Sami and Karamenderes 
questioned, however, whether the government will be able to 
sustain this policy in the medium term, pointing out that the 
figures Gul announced in meeting Turkey\'s 6.5 percent primary 
surplus target, while IMF blessed, are very ambitious.  They 
also noted that they represent a shift from AK\'s earlier 
populist stance to agreement to squeeze savings out of the 
public sector, and will be politically difficult.  Most 
critically, a variety of looming factors, including weak 
demand, increasing oil prices, tourism declines, and 
increased military spending, may \"strangle growth\" and leave 
the government far short of its revenue targets.   The 
cascading challenges, in Sami\'s and Karamenderes\' view, may 
lead the government to \"give up\" and abandon the program at 
some point this summer or fall.  Alternatively, they 
suggested, the government might at that point move to 
restructure its domestic and foreign debt, or, in a worst 
case scenario, default, a possibility they regarded 
phlegmatically.  \"Opportunistic investors are out there 
waiting,\" they said, arguing that default has lost some of 
its past stigma. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: The vote came as a shock to Istanbul 
markets and observers, and has shaken market confidence.  The 
government\'s quick moves on the IMF front have dampened some 
of that impact, however.  Sami and Karamanderes did note that 
ironically if a second vote were successful the end result 
would be the best of all possible worlds: unblocking of large 
American assistance, but only after the government had pushed 
the IMF program further than it was previously willing to go. 
 End Comment.

This is a joint Istanbul-Ankara cable.  Sensitive but 
Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: Turkish government and tourism industry 
officials are bracing in anticipation of a sharp downturn in 
tourism in the event of an Iraq operation.  The sector, 
Turkey\'s largest foreign exchange earner, turned in a good 
performance in 2002, earning over 10 billion USD (27 percent 
of all foreign currency income).  Anecdotal reports hinting 
at reservation declines of 30-50 percent in the first months 
of 2003 have led some to suggest that the sector could lose 
4-5 billion USD for the year as a whole.  The Tourism 
Minister is putting a braver face on the situation. 
Unsurprisingly, all agree that while a quick and successful 
operation\'s effect could be rapidly overcome, an extended 
campaign would have a much larger impact.  Key tests will 
come later this month at tourism fairs in Germany and 
Russia--Turkey\'s largest tourism markets.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Already Feeling the Chill: Tourism Ministry 
officials told Embassy Econ officer this week that Turkey is 
already feeling the chill from war anxiety.  Summer travel 
reservations that are usually made in January to February 
have slowed considerably, they reported, while by some 
anecdotal accounts hotel reservations are off by 30 to 50 
percent.  Istanbul\'s Ciragan Hotel, for instance, reports a 
25 percent decline in bookings.  The Ministry\'s Acting Head 
of External Relations, Tolga Tuyluoglu, admitted that 
predicting the exact effect of a crisis is difficult, but 
that based on Turkey\'s Gulf experience, a former Ministry 
official has estimated that Turkey would lose 4-5 billion USD 
in 2003 and 10-12 billion over the next three years.  This 
year\'s target of 15 million travelers generating 12 billion 
USD in revenue, already an ambitious increase from last 
year\'s 10 billion USD level, would appear well out of reach. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Industry Predictions: Basaran Ulusoy, President of 
the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies, told us on March 
5 that the association concurs in estimates of a 40-50 
percent decline in tourism: without a war it estimates 
tourism revenue at 10.35 billion USD; in the event of a war 
it forsees only 5.5 billion USD in revenues (these totals do 
not include the 1.5 billion USD that the government adds to 
account for unrecorded income--the association thus 
calculates 2002 revenue at 8.5 billion USD.)  ATA Invest, one 
of Turkey\'s leading brokerages, predicts a slightly higher 
level of tourism revenue for 2003--8.5 billion USD.  All 
noted that beyond its importance to Turkish foreign exchange 
earnings (27 percent last year), tourism is deeply interwoven 
into the fabric of the Turkish economy, and by the Ministry\'s 
count 38 associated sectors ranging from food to jewelry and 
carpets will also be negatively impacted. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Anecdotes: Turkish Tourism Investors\' Association 
(TYD) Secretary General Nedret Koruyan told us March 4 that 
she is already hearing reports that travel agents in Europe 
are pressing Turkish tourist facilities for price cuts, given 
slumping demand.  Since prices never fully recovered from the 
Gulf Crisis, however, she sees little margin for such 
flexibility for the industry.  Ulusoy, whose family runs one 
of Turkey\'s largest tourism conglomerates, noted numerous 
anecdotal examples of the freeze in the market, ranging from 
cancellation of 44 maritime cruises to Turkey (which will 
severely impact the Kusadasi and Istanbul regions), to 
rent-a-car firms backing out of car purchase agreements.  As 
for the Association itself, while typically it purchases 
eight million museum tickets from the Ministry of Culture to 
sell at cost to its members, this year it is only taking 2.5 
million. 
 
 
5. (SBU) A Brave Face: If privately Ministry officials are 
pessimistic about Turkey\'s prospects, Tourism Minister Guldal 
Aksit is putting a braver face on the situation.  She told 
\"Hurriyet\" newspaper this week that she is an optimist, and 
that by diversifying its tourism market, Turkey would be able 
to limit an operation\'s impact.  Industry observers made 
clear that while they do not share the Minister\'s views, they 
understand that she must remain a cheerleader for the sector: 
if she cried that the sky was falling, Ulusoy commented, it 
would fall that much more quickly and lead banks to move to 
foreclose on loans to the sector.  Already many companies 
face bankruptcy, as reduced revenue flows will not cover 
financing costs of the renovations and projects they 
completed in the off-season. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Hoping for a Short War: Both Ulusoy and Koruyan 
agreed that a short war, started soon and finished in a few 
weeks, could limit the impact on the sector to 25-30 percent, 
and permit it to recover in a few years.  However, even in 
this case a significant impact is unavoidable, as the current 
uncertainty has already begun to affect bookings, given that 
March is the month in which many summer reservations are made 
and in which airlines plan their summer schedules.  Ulusoy 
reiterated a refrain we heard frequently last fall (and heard 
in Ankara this week as well), in expressing regret that 
international exigencies had prevented the operation from 
being launched and completed in January and February. 
 
 
7. (SBU) New Realities: Behind the high impact estimates are 
several new realities facing the industry.  Turkey\'s 
competitors have already started using the possibility of 
military action against Iraq to promote themselves at 
Turkey\'s expense.  Ulusoy noted Greece\'s new pitch to the 
industry: \"Come to Greece, there is no war in our 
neighborhood.\"  Both Ulusoy and Koruyan noted that travel 
contracts, beyond providing an out in case of force majeure 
(such as war), also now include alternate destinations, so 
that travelers can be easily rerouted to back-up locations. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Interrupted Progress: The uncertainty caused by the 
Iraqi crisis has interrupted Turkey\'s strong rebound in 2002 
from the post-September 11 world tourism downturn.  Koruyan 
characterized last year as a very good year, noting that 
Turkey had experienced the largest increase in tourism in the 
Mediterranean region.  January figures continued that trend, 
with total arrivals increasing by 18 percent from 2002, and 
EU arrivals increasing by 45 percent.  Even arrivals from the 
U.S. and Japan, two countries that Koruyan characterized as 
\"lost markets\" for Turkey, increased by 11 and 17 percent 
respectively (though U.S. tourism in Turkey is still barely 
half its pre-September 11 level).  (Note: MOT officials are 
less willing to write off these markets, as American and 
Japanese tourists typically spend more per capita than their 
European counterparts.  End Note.)  Koruyan noted that Turkey 
has benefited from its price advantage over rival 
destinations in the Mediterranean: introduction of the Euro, 
she suggested, had provided a pronounced edge over Spain and 
Greece (which saw a 5.6 percent decline in tourism in 2002). 
 
 
9. (SBU) Repackaging the Market:  Koruyan also gave some 
credit for the strong results in 2002 to the Ministry of 
Tourism\'s new advertising campaign.  While funding has 
remained flat at 50 million USD, it has been refocused away 
from Turkey as a general destination and towards emphasis of 
specific  areas such as Antalya (especially popular among 
Russians) and Bodrum (popular with British and German 
tourists).  It is easier to distance such resorts from Iraq 
than to distance Turkey as a whole, Koruyan suggested. 
 
 
10. (SBU) Key Tests: Both Ministry and Industry contacts 
stress that Turkey faces its key tests this month, with major 
tourism fairs in both Germany and Russia, the country\'s two 
key tourism markets (with 3.5 million and 950,000 visitors 
respectively in 2002).  The industry pins special hopes on 
the Russian market, which in the past has proven more crisis 
resistant than its European counterparts.  But Ulusoy noted 
that even a charter package from Kazakstan was recently 
cancelled because of war concerns: \"I thought they were used 
to crises,\" he noted. 
 
 
11. (SBU) Comment: Given the sensitivity of the sector to 
international conditions, a significant impact on Turkey from 
both continued uncertainty and/or a war is unavoidable.  If 
quick and decisive, however, observers concur that the impact 
can be overcome.  They note too the potential upside from an 
end to uncertainty and from a regime change in Iraq.  Ulusoy, 
who professed strong support for U.S. goals in Iraq, 
estimated that there are three to three-and-a-half million 
potential annual visitors to Turkey from Iraq and the broader 
Middle East who do not now travel because of the crisis.  End 
Comment.

CONSIDERS CHANGES 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Following a March 10 meeting to review and 
discuss a report it had commissioned from the International 
Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), members of the 
Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission (TARC) have been 
unable to reach agreement on how to deal with the contentious 
\"genocide\" issue.  Moving forward, TARC may make some changes 
in its composition and focus in order to overcome fundamental 
differences that have hindered progress in its work to date. 
End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) The Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission 
(TARC) met in London on March 10 to review and discuss the 
report it had commissioned in July 2002 from the 
International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ).  The 
ICTJ report, entitled \"The Applicability of the U.N. 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide to Events Which Occurred During the Early Twentieth 
Century,\" was sent to TARC members last month and has 
subsequently been reprinted in the Turkish and Armenian 
press.  Although the ICTJ report\'s explicitly legal nature 
and narrow focus dramatically limit its implications, the 
simple fact that both the Armenian and Turkish members of 
TARC agreed to commission the ICTJ report is a positive 
development.  The first half of the report indicates that \"no 
legal, financial, or territorial claim arising out of the 
Events could successfully be made against any individual or 
state under the Convention.\"  But the report continues in the 
second half to note that the Events themselves could be said 
\"to include all of the elements of the crime of genocide as 
defined in the Convention\" (in other words, that the term 
\"genocide\" can be applied to tragedy that befell the 
Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire). 
 
 
3. (U) The report has not received significant attention in 
the Turkish press.  Former Ambassador and TARC member Gunduz 
Aktan has publicly expressed his concern that the ICTJ\'s 
conclusions might be taken out of context and interpreted as 
a judgment on the Events themselves rather than a legal 
opinion on the applicability of a legal definition.  He and 
others have commented that because the term \"genocide,\" as 
legally defined by the Convention, can be applied to any 
number of ethnic clashes, it has lost all practical meaning. 
 
 
4. (C) On March 12, former Turkish Ambassador (also President 
of the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation) Ozdem 
Sanberk and Sabanci University Professor and former 
Bosphorous University Rector Ustun Erguder (both TARC 
members) told poloff separately that the March 10 meeting had 
gone reasonably well.  Over the course of past meetings, 
Sanberk and Erguder said that interpersonal dynamics between 
the Turkish and Armenian participants have been good, 
although they continue to have fundamental differences on the 
key issue of \"genocide.\"  (Note and Comment: Erguder had 
earlier remarked to poloff that \"one particular Turkish 
member\" had been offended and upset by the exchanges during 
one of the sessions and that this had led to a long pause in 
the TARC\'s activities.  Based on Erguder\'s comments, poloff 
believes that he may have been referring to Gunduz Aktan. 
End Note and Comment.)  Sanberk reported that there had been 
\"total disagreement,\" for example, on the ICTJ report, 
particularly its second half.  Erguder told poloff that he 
personally had found the ICTJ report to be fair and balanced, 
but confirmed, however, that the only aspect the Commission 
could agree on was to put the report behind them. Looking 
forward, Sanberk and Erguder said that the TARC will continue 
its work, but that there was a possibility that there might 
be partial, or even total, changes in both the Armenian and 
Turkish sides of the Commission.  Erguder added that he had 
suggested that TARC abandon the \"genocide\" issue for now and 
focus instead on promoting other people-to-people and civil 
society activities.  He claimed that Armenian Assembly of 
America Chairman Van Krikorian reacted favorably to this 
proposal. 
 
 
5. (C) Comment: The TARC has had a rocky and difficult road, 
particularly in weathering criticism from the Armenian 
diaspora.  Sanberk and Erguder claim from their personal 
experience that Turks have been far less critical than 
Armenians of the TARC.  However, TARC\'s work is not widely 
followed in Turkey.  At the same time, we are beginning to 
hear such criticism in Istanbul as well.  Most recently, for 
example, Kaan Soyak (please protect), the President of the 
Turkish-Armenian Business Development Council (a commercial 
group that also promotes people-to-people and commercial 
activities), told poloff on March 8 that his contacts in both 
the Armenian and Turkish communities are fed up with TARC and 
are eager for \"a new approach.\"

Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: In assessing the outlook for the new 
government to be led by Justice and Development (AK) Party 
leader Tayyip Erdogan, we look back at his only major 
previous government experience --- as Istanbul Mayor from 
1994 to 1998.  End Summary. 
 
 
Refah and Grassroots Politics 
----------------------------- 
2. (U) Erdogan ran for Istanbul Mayor in 1994 with little 
prior political experience.  However, he had benefited from 
his work in the milieu of Islamist leader Erbakan\'s National 
View (Milli Gorus) Movement, Erbakan\'s Refah Party (RP), and 
his own natural political skills and personal charisma.  A 
graduate of a preacher (Imam-Hatip) high school, Erdogan 
worked his way up through the RP system and ran for Istanbul 
Mayor from the platform of RP Chairman for Istanbul.  At that 
time, Refah had pioneered pervasive grassroots political 
organization, door-to-door campaigning, charitable donations, 
and other techniques now widely emulated by other political 
parties in Istanbul.  Such tactics proved to be particularly 
successful in the populous Istanbul districts of 
Gaziosmanpasa, Umraniye, Fatih, and Bagcilar districts --- 
poor, migrant neighborhoods that were rapidly expanding as 
Turkey underwent massive urbanization.  The newcomers came 
from the poorest parts of Anatolia in search of jobs and 
economic stability.  But Istanbul\'s inability to absorb them 
combined with years of chronic high inflation left most 
living in dire economic conditions, adding to the swelling 
ranks of the urban poor.  Mostly conservative and religious, 
they were welcomed by similarly conservative local RP 
activists, mostly head-scarved women, who provided them with 
donations of food and coal, as well as advice on how to find 
homes and jobs.  Largely on the basis of their support, RP 
had made steady in-roads in these and other neighborhoods of 
Istanbul since 1984, winning an increasing share of the vote 
and minor victories, including the Fatih District Mayorship 
in 1989. 
 
 
A Tight Race, A Narrow Mandate 
------------------------------ 
3. (C) The support of the Refah party organization alone, 
however, was not enough.  Erdogan benefited from the fact 
that the Istanbul 1994 election was a tightly contested race 
with strong candidates from several of the other parties. 
The left and left-center votes were divided between 
Democratic Left Party (DSP) candidate Necdet Ozkan (brother 
of Husamettin Ozkan, who later became deputy PM under PM 
Ecevit) and Socalist Democratic People\'s Party (SHP) 
candidate Zulfu Livaneli.  The votes from the center-right 
were split between Ilhan Kesici from the Motherland Party 
(ANAP) and former Istanbul Mayor Bedrettin Dalan, who 
abandoned ANAP and ran on the True Path Party (DYP) ticket. 
Dalan told us recently that he had been promised the ANAP 
nomination only to have it personally rescinded by ANAP 
Chairman Mesut Yilmaz.  Dalan says that he then accepted the 
DYP nomination with no expectation of victory (Note: DYP is 
traditionally very weak in Istanbul. End Note), hoping merely 
to split the center-right vote, deny victory to Kesici, and 
thereby spite Yilmaz and ANAP.  The final results suggest 
that he may have succeeded.  Erdogan edged out Kesici by a 
little more than 40,000 votes with only 25.6 percent to 
Kesici\'s 24.6 percent.  Livaneli finished third with 17.4 
percent and Dalan \"the spoiler\" finished with 12.5 percent. 
 
 
Erdogan the Man 
--------------- 
4. (U) Although impossible to quantify, Erdogan\'s charisma 
and political savvy have also been key factors in his success 
as a politician (see ref A for more detail).  Erdogan has 
supporters throughout Istanbul and in all walks of life. 
When asked why they like him, the most common response is 
that he is someone they can trust.  Erdogan was a fresh face, 
a talented football player, and came from humble beginnings 
-- all political assets in a country that is chronically 
disappointed with its politicians, as was the case with 
Erdogan\'s predecessor, Nurettin Sozen.  Most Istanbul 
residents also respected Erdogan\'s faith and devotion, 
although his Islamist credentials were somewhat alarming and 
controversial among the secularist establishment and public 
media.  This controversy was fueled by pre-election promises 
to build a mosque in Taksim square and close the city\'s 
brothels, as well as by Mayor Erdogan\'s decisions to ban 
alcohol in municipal facilities and to close the cafeterias 
during Ramadan. 
 
 
Targeting the Urban Poor 
------------------------ 
5. (C) Once in office, however, Erdogan worked quickly to 
bolster his public support and reward those who elected him 
by devoting his efforts to addressing the needs of the urban 
poor.  The standard mantra used by Erdogan supporters to 
characterize his term is one in which corruption was replaced 
by honest administration and city services were actually 
delivered.  This view enjoys much popular resonance.  When 
before the election we asked Erdogan supporters why they 
backed him, we most often heard the refrain that \"he got 
things done in Istanbul.\"  Erdogan himself pointed to his 
success in such areas as increasing water fee collections 
25-fold to 25 million USD, thereby enabling the city to wean 
itself from reliance on foreign donors to provide this 
essential service.  More generally, Erdogan supporters 
stressed the city\'s improving budget picture during his 
tenure, in which a 2 billion USD deficit was transformed into 
a surplus and civic investments expanded dramatically. 
Scrutiny of Istanbul\'s budget books confirm some but not all 
of these points.  In contrast to earlier periods, Istanbul 
under Erdogan consistently ran a budget surplus.  Public 
investments were not sacrificed to meet day-to-day 
obligations, but were largely realized at the same rate as 
the rest of the budget. 
 
 
6. (C)  Many of our interlocutors point to the roads, gas, 
and water networks built in the poor suburbs, crediting 
Erdogan with improving the quality of life for millions of 
Istanbul residents.  Erdogan gets less praise from middle and 
upper-class Istanbul residents, many of whom live in the 
richer neighborhoods of Besiktas, Bakirkoy, and Kadikoy, 
which continued to experience the chronic urban challenges of 
pollution and congestion.  Here, too, however, Erdogan is 
often credited with completing the first line of Istanbul\'s 
underground metro, cleaning up the Golden Horn, and 
constructing an extensive natural gas network.  Former Mayor 
Dalan claims that Erdogan had no \"vision\" and failed to 
implement any major, new projects, merely executing those 
that had been in the pipeline for years.  He says that 
Erdogan called him to personally apologize for abandoning 
Dalan\'s plan to revamp Taksim Square by rerouting traffic 
through underground tunnels.  But even Dalan admits that 
Erdogan was significantly better than his predecessor Sozen 
and concedes that Erdogan \"tried.\"  Rusen Cakir, a veteran 
journalist with the Vatan daily newspaper and author of a 
book on the Refah Party and a biography of Erdogan himself, 
told poloff that from the beginning Erdogan saw Istanbul as a 
platform for higher political ambitions.  As a result, 
Erdogan worked hard to cultivate a broad constituency and 
develop a reputation as an honest, effective administrator. 
 
 
Corruption 
---------- 
7. (C) If there is agreement that the depiction of Erdogan as 
a mayor who got things done has a strong base in reality, 
more questions surround the argument that he ran a clean (or 
\"ak\") government.  Views differ as to Erdogan\'s personal 
complicity in the various corruption scandals of his 
administration, but there are few who would deny that \"where 
there is smoke, there is fire.\"  And while it is certainly 
possible that the prosecution of the cases against Erdogan 
may have been politically motivated, the public evidence and 
what we have heard from Istanbul contacts in a position to 
know point to an extensive pattern of corruption (see refs A 
and B for further details).  The major scandals involved 
corruption in the awarding of public tenders for the city 
natural gas distribution system, the underground metro, 
cleaning up the Golden Horn, trash collection, municipal 
shuttle bus service, and planting trees in public spaces. 
Erdogan was also charged with misappropriating funds by 
manipulating data on the electronic tickets used for the 
city\'s transportation services and for renting out municipal 
advertisement billboards for below-market prices.  He has 
been acquitted from all but one of these cases, although 
there is still a possibility that other cases could still be 
opened. 
 
 
8. (C) Former Istanbul CHP Chairman Mehmet Boluk, who was at 
least partially responsible for collecting the evidence that 
led to these cases, told us that major corruption in Istanbul 
began under Dalan, continued under Sozen, but reached new 
heights under Erdogan.  Rusen Cakir disagrees, arguing that 
while corruption took place under Erdogan, it was much more 
centralized and controlled (and therefore less in absolute 
terms) than under Dalan and Sozen. In any case, the pattern 
of corruption has been the same.  Mayors have used their 
power to award and cancel public tenders to funnel money to 
favored companies.  These companies, presumably, return the 
favor by making payments into personal bank accounts or to 
favored charities.  Another well-informed observer of Turkish 
politics told us that in many cases political parties simply 
send their campaign expenses to such companies, which then 
pay them and conceal the payments as assorted business 
expenses.  Rusen Cakir and others have told us that the 
proceeds of corruption during Erdogan\'s administration were 
primarily directed to charities and a select group of people, 
and not widely disbursed through the city administration. 
9. (C) How did Erdogan manage to keep his hands clean and 
escape responsibility?  Boluk, who is also a former 
investigative journalist (who also gathered and presented 
evidence against Erdogan\'s CHP predecessor Sozen), believes 
that the various cases have been dropped largely as a result 
of political pressure from Erdogan and his supporters.  Boluk 
cited the AKBIL (electronic ticket) case as an example. 
After failing to appear for three consecutive court dates, 
Erdogan finally came to court with a new legal team that 
included two retired judges from the same court.  Without 
explanation, the prosecutor himself asked that the charges be 
dropped.  In other cases, unexplained delays in procedural 
matters have led to charges being dropped due to a statute of 
limitations clause. There are still outstanding charges 
related to the IGDAS case, for example, but the prosecutor 
has kept the file on his desk for months. 
 
 
10. (C) Among the public, the cases have lacked traction 
because of the widely-shared belief, stemming from Erdogan\'s 
1997 conviction for \"Islamist sedition\", that Turkey\'s 
secular establishment was hounding him and using the legal 
system to pursue political ends.  In addition, unlike the 
\"mainstream\" politicians who ran Istanbul, Erdogan still 
benefits from a perception, almost uniquely applied to 
Islamist politicians, that corruptly-attained funds were 
plowed back either into city services-- via purchases of 
ambulances, garbage trucks, and other amenities for 
impoverished districts-- or in party/movement building rather 
than venal pocket-lining.  (Note: As ref A notes, our 
\"establishment\" contacts confirm that this perception had an 
important basis in reality, and that ironically they would 
have preferred the older system to being forced to contribute 
to causes in which they did not believe.  End Note.)  AK\'s 
move away from piously Islamic rhetoric to more mainstream 
issues, coupled with its recruitment of shady though 
presumably more traditional political figures, has made it 
harder for Erdogan to maintain this political teflon. 
 
 
Erdogan\'s Cronies 
----------------- 
11. (C) Many of the other defendants and people who 
presumably profited from these scandals have accompanied 
Erdogan and the AK party to Ankara.  The president of a think 
tank with close links to the Turkish government and state 
told us that although other AK parliamentarians and party 
people may be fiercely ideological, he believes that this 
group is motivated primarily by its loyalty to Erdogan. 
Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim, formerly the General 
Director of the Istanbul Sea Bus, was removed from office on 
corruption charges that took place under Erdogan.  Energy 
Minister Mehmet Hilmi Guler was an adviser to Erdogan and an 
IGDAS (Istanbul Natural Gas Distribution Company) board 
member and a defendant in the natural gas corruption case. 
Among those who are rumored to be added to a new Erdogan 
cabinet next week are Idris Naim Sahin and Akif Gulle, both 
of whom worked with Erdogan in Istanbul and were implicated 
in various corruption scandals.  There are also more than a 
dozen other AK parliamentarians that were implicated in the 
various Erdogan corruption scandals.  Separately, the heads 
of several major city-managed firms during Erdogan\'s tenure 
and other Erdogan advisers have since been newly appointed to 
lucrative positions as the heads of state-owned companies, 
including Turkish Airlines, the State Water Works, Turkish 
Petroleum Refineries Corporation, and the General Foundations 
Directorate. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
12. (C) Was Erdogan a successful mayor?  The answer depends 
on whom you talk to and what constitutes success in their 
minds.  One thing is clear, however.  Despite his narrow 
mandate, the corruption scandals, and unrelenting criticism 
regarding his Islamic leanings, Erdogan remained loyal to the 
constituency that elected him.  He had little time for 
grandiose new plans, instead devoting the bulk of his efforts 
to providing municipal services to the urban poor.  In the 
process he may well have enriched a circle of friends and 
supporters, thereby laying important groundwork for the 
eventual establishment of the AK Party and its success at the 
polls in 2002.  Among the AK parliamentarians and other 
power-brokers that have relocated to Ankara, it is likely 
that there is a sizable group that is motivated more by 
loyalty to Erdogan (and perhaps by simple greed) than by 
ideological considerations.  As for Erdogan himself, if his 
service as Istanbul Mayor is any guide, his efforts as Prime 
Minister will be primarily devoted to solidifying and 
expanding AK\'s voter base.  And although that base has 
expanded considerably beyond the urban poor of Istanbul, it 
still remains largely disenfranchised and conservative. 
Satisfying this segment of the Turkish population while 
operating under the rigid austerity of Turkey\'s IMF program 
will be among Erdogan\'s greatest challenges.  End Comment.

TAGS: PHUM, TK, Istanbul 
SUBJECT: PUSHING BACK ON CENSORSHIP: \"ARARAT\" AND FREEDOM 
OF THOUGHT 
 
1. (U) Summary: Istanbul contacts claim the overall climate 
for free expression continues to improve.  While the GOT 
continues to censor works dealing with the Kurdish issue and 
other sensitive topics, improvements in legislation have 
strengthened the underlying legal basis for freedom of 
expression.  The film \"Ararat,\" which runs headfirst into one 
of the most sensitive political issues in Turkey, the tragic 
massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during the early 
twentieth century, is not expected to face obstacles to its 
release in Turkey.  These Istanbul contacts ascribe most 
problems with censorship not to specific government policies, 
but to narrow-minded bureaucrats who are stubbornly resistant 
to change.  End Summary. 
 
 
Freedom of Thought Movement 
-------------------------------------- 
2. (U) Author and free speech activist Sanar Yurdatapan 
described the work of his Freedom of Thought movement, which 
began in 1995 as a signature campaign in support of renowned 
author Yasar Kemal, who was under investigation for a letter 
he had published in a national daily.  Using a Turkish law 
that held writers and publishers equally responsible for 
their publications, Yurdatapan and over 1000 supporters 
\"re-published\" Kemal\'s letter, thereby forcing the 
prosecutors to open cases against all of them.  The cases 
dragged on for years, eventually resulting in dismissals for 
the defendants.   In the meantime, the movement replicated 
these tactics and began to publish regular compilations of 
writings and transcripts that had been subject to 
investigations and trials, using prominent names as 
\"publishers\" to publicize the cases and shame the system into 
acquitting the defendants.  The movement continues to publish 
one or more pamphlets each year and supports the original 
defendants in their legal battles in the courts. 
 
 
Film Review and Rating Commission 
--------------------------------- 
3. (U) Film directors, producers, and distributors generally 
fare somewhat better than their prose counterparts.  Unlike 
publishers, however, film producers and distributors must 
submit films to the Review and Rating Commissions (RRC) for 
an age-based suitability rating and prior approval before 
they can distribute them to theaters.  Legislative reforms in 
1991 established a Lower RRC with 3 members (2 appointed by 
the industry, one by the state) and a Higher RRC with 7 
members (4 appointed by the industry, 2 by the state, and one 
by the National Security Council).  Only particularly 
controversial and sensitive cases are submitted to the Higher 
RRC.  According to Bedahattin Cetin, President of Belge Film 
(a film distribution company specializing in foreign and 
artistic films) and Vice President of the National Film 
Platform (an industry coalition), only one film has been 
denied marketing approval since the RRCs were established. 
That film, \"Big Man, Small Love,\" was subsequently granted 
approval by the courts (and won national accolades), although 
the director herself is still the subject of an ongoing court 
case. 
 
 
\"Ararat\": No Problems Expected 
------------------------------ 
4. (U) Cetin currently owns the distribution rights for 
\"Ararat,\" the film written and directed by Atom Egoyan about 
the mass killing of Armenians that took place in 1915 in the 
waning days of the Ottoman Empire.  Cetin told poloff that he 
expects a very limited demand for the film, perhaps no more 
than three screens.  Although there were local press reports 
last year when the film first came to public attention that 
the then-National Security Council described it as the 
greatest threat to Turkey since \"Midnight Express,\" Cetin 
assured poloff that he has not experienced, nor does he 
anticipate, any problems or obstacles in bringing the film to 
Turkey.  \"In fact, a government minister personally 
congratulated me on taking the initiative,\" Cetin said. 
Cetin did note that he planned to edit a particularly violent 
and shocking rape scene, but not for political reasons (Cetin 
claims that, upon hearing his concerns, the film\'s director 
admitted that the same scene had been edited for U.S. 
distribution).   Cetin\'s primary concerns are about the 
timing of the film\'s release in relation to a possible war in 
Iraq. 
 
 
Narrow-Minded Bureaucrats 
------------------------- 
5. (U) Both Yurdatapan and Cetin told poloff that the primary 
obstacles to freedom of expression are narrow-minded 
bureaucrats who are generally inclined to ignore legislative 
changes that protect the rights of writers, journalists, and 
film makers.  Asked whether there might be a link between the 
level and type of harassment and which political parties are 
in government, both said they had not detected any such 
pattern.   According to Yurdatapan, many, if not most, of the 
cases filed against writers and journalists are eventually 
dismissed in the courts.  The cases and trials themselves, 
however, continue to be used as a form of harassment.  As for 
films, despite having prior approval from the RRCs, Cetin 
admitted that local governors still have the authority to 
pull films from the theaters and send them to court if they 
believe they are subversive.  The American film \"Basic 
Instinct\" and the Iranian-Kurdish film \"A Time for Drunken 
Horses,\" for example, were pulled from theaters in separate 
provinces on the order of local governors (the former for its 
explicit sexuality, the latter for its portrayal of the 
Kurds).  The courts overturned the bans in both cases and the 
increased publicity that resulted led to long and successful 
runs in the theaters. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
6. (U) If the opening of \"Ararat\" goes as smoothly as Cetin 
predicts, it would indeed be a positive sign.  However, to 
date, it remains unclear whether recent reforms will lead to 
a broad loosening of state censorship.  The Publishers\' 
Association of Turkey reports that, in 2002, the GOT opened 
cases against 67 books and leveled charges against 35 
publishers and 48 writers; in 2001, the GOT took such action 
against 42 books, 23 publishers and 38 writers.  The GOT 
continues to level charges of separatism against writers and 
publishers of works dealing with the Kurdish issue or using 
the word \"Kurdistan.\"

SUBJECT: ARMENIAN PATRIARCH MESROB II ON THE CHURCH, 
ARMENIA, AND TURKEY 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: In a March 13 meeting, Istanbul Armenian 
Patriarch Mesrob II blamed Catholicos Karekin II and Armenian 
President Robert Kocharian for increasing tensions within the 
Armenian Church and criticized the Armenian Diaspora for 
focusing exclusively on \"genocide\" recognition and for 
ignoring Turkish-Armenian reconciliation.  Mesrob admitted 
that the Armenian community in Turkey continues to experience 
problems regarding their right to own property, but dismissed 
it as an issue for international concern.  Mesrob is also 
hopeful that the new single-party Justice and Development 
Party (AKP) government will carry through on some of its 
early rhetoric regarding the treatment of minority religious 
communities.  End Summary. 
 
 
Armenian Orthodox Church 
------------------------ 
2. (C) Placing the blame squarely on Etchmiadzin and Yerevan, 
Mesrob told poloff that tensions within the Armenian Orthodox 
Church are on the rise.  Although personal relationships 
between the Catholicos and Patriarchs are good, Mesrob 
claimed that Catholicos Karekin II\'s efforts to assert his 
authority have caused friction with the others (Note: In 
addition to Catholicos Karekin II in Etchmiadzin (Armenia), 
there are three other hierarchical Sees in the Church: the 
Catholicos of Cilicia (Lebanon), and the Patriarchs of 
Jerusalem and Constantinople. End Note).  Mesrob lamented 
that Karekin\'s election to the Catholicosate in 1999 had not 
been democratic, and, in fact, had been orchestrated by 
Armenian President Robert Kocharian.  According to Mesrob, 
Armenians worldwide are increasingly frustrated with the 
Armenian government and their Church.  Clearly disappointed 
that Kocharian was reelected March 5, Mesrob doubted whether 
such an outcome would have been possible without massive 
election fraud.  Poloff told Mesrob that both the OSCE and 
the State Department had publicly criticized the conduct of 
the elections and called on the Armenian government to 
investigate the irregularities. 
 
 
Armenians in Turkey 
------------------- 
3. (C) As for his own community, Mesrob told poloff that his 
best estimates indicate that there are between 50,000 and 
60,000 Orthodox Armenians in Turkey (Note: There are a few 
thousand Armenian Catholics as well.  End Note).  The Turkish 
government estimated that there are as many as 80,000, but 
Mesrob believes this number is exaggerated and may include 
many Armenians who have since emigrated.  Mesrob reports that 
the population is fairly stable; there are even 100 or so new 
converts each year.  More interesting, Mesrob offered, is the 
continuous stream of visitors claiming Armenian descent and 
varying levels of adherence to Church traditions who come to 
see him from all over Turkey.  When he himself travels to 
other parts of Turkey, particularly the eastern regions, 
Mesrob said that he is besieged by such people.  Mesrob 
deliberately refrains from encouraging such visits and 
exchanges in order to avoid the appearance of proselytization 
and to preserve good relations with the Turkish government. 
Asked to hazard a guess as to their numbers, Mesrob 
speculated that there might be a million or more such people 
who accept their Armenian roots.  (Comment: Poloff has heard 
similar estimates from other sources as well.  End Comment). 
 
 
4. (C) With regard to ongoing government restrictions on the 
activities and rights of the local Armenian community, Mesrob 
admitted that in spite of recent improvements in legislation, 
such problems continue.  Shortly before meeting with poloff, 
for example, Mesrob  had met with local Armenians to decide 
whether to take legal and/or political measures in response 
to a decision to revoke a property deed for one of the 
Armenian high schools.  (Note: Although Mesrob did not 
mention the school by name, a sympathetic March 23 article in 
daily Radikal suggests that he may have been referring to the 
Surp Hac Armenian School in Uskudar.  End Note).  Despite 
these difficulties, however, Mesrob was emphatic in 
emphasizing that he does not believe that this should be a 
subject of international concern.  In his view, U.S. and 
European pressure on the Turkish government has been 
counterproductive. \"Would it make sense for Turkey to lobby 
the U.S. on behalf of Native Americans?\" he asked 
rhetorically.  Mesrob acknowledged that each religious 
minority deals with these issues differently.  The Greeks, he 
said, favor a more confrontational approach because they feel 
that Ecumenical Patriarch Bartolomeos\' political stature 
gives them more influence.  Meanwhile, the Jews rely heavily 
on the political and financial support of a few powerful 
patrons within their community (including Jak Kamhi (Profilo) 
and Isak Alaton (Alarko)). 
 
 
Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation 
------------------------------- 
5. (C) Mesrob told poloff that the real obstacle to 
Turkish-Armenian reconciliation lies with the Armenian 
Diaspora.  According to him, most older Turks acknowledge 
that the so-called \"genocide\" occurred, but are unable to 
discuss it openly.  The Diaspora, however, is single-mindedly 
focused on recognition of the \"genocide\" and has no interest 
in Turkish-Armenian reconciliation.  Mesrob also questioned 
Armenian President Kocharian\'s commitment to reconciliation, 
suggesting that he too may be overly influenced by the 
Diaspora.  Mesrob told poloff that his own position is 
particularly delicate.  He is seen by many in the Diaspora as 
an apologist for Turkey and by many in Turkey as an agent of 
Armenia.  As long as he can avoid feeding these 
misimpressions,  Mesrob assured poloff that he is personally 
prepared to do whatever he can to support reconciliation; he 
is even ready to travel to Azerbaijan for meetings with the 
Chief Mufti, an offer he claimed he recently made to the 
General Director for Religious Affairs Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz 
(Note: Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz retired on March 17 \"under 
pressure\" from the AK government.  End Note). 
 
 
Turkish Politics 
---------------- 
6. (C) Asked whether he expected to see movement on these 
issues from the new Justice and Development Party (AKP) 
government, Mesrob remarked that they have been saying some 
of the right things, but that he has not seen many tangible 
results so far.  He did note that this single-party 
government may be in a stronger position to effect change 
than the previous coalition government.  Ties between the 
Patriarchate and the Democratic Left Party (DSP) and 
Motherland Party (ANAP) coalition partners in the 1999-2002 
Ecevit government had been good, but the third coalition 
partner, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), had refused to 
even meet with him.  Mesrob dismissed speculation that 
Islamic-leaning AKP may \"use\" the minority religious 
communities as an excuse and cover for loosening state 
control over religion to advance their \"hidden\" 
socio-religious agenda.  Mesrob also doubted whether AKP 
would be able to undertake any bold initiatives regarding 
either its minority populations or relations with Armenia 
until after the Iraq situation is resolved. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
7. (C) Much of what Mesrob said about the differences between 
the minority religious communities tracks closely with what 
we have observed.  Of the three major communities, the Greeks 
(numbering only a few thousand) have been the quickest (and 
often only) ones to ask for our help in addressing property 
and religious training issues.  The Jewish community 
(numbering about 22,000) explicitly prefers a 
non-confrontational style, which they claim has enabled them 
to meet the needs of their community.  Perhaps because they 
are faced with such sensitive and unresolved issues (i.e., 
\"genocide\" and Turkish-Armenian reconciliation) and because 
they are caught between Armenia and the Armenian Diaspora, on 
the one hand, and the Turkish government and a nationalist 
Turkish population, on the other hand, the Armenian community 
here has been careful to deal with their local problems 
themselves without appealing for international assistance. 
At the same time, the three communities have cordial 
relations and have cooperated on a number of issues.  Most 
recently, all three community leaders openly supported 
Turkey\'s EU aspirations.  Mesrob claims that they had planned 
to make a joint trip to European capitals before Copenhagen, 
but in the end he made the trip alone (Note: His initiative 
was widely reported and well-received in the Turkish media. 
End Note).

TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU, Istanbul 
SUBJECT: ISTANBUL ECONOMIC ANALYSTS: LOOKING FOR A LIFELINE 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Chief Stuart Smith.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: After a rocky start to the week on Monday, 
word that the U.S. Iraq supplemental contains 1 billion USD 
for Turkey has been seized on as a lifeline by Istanbul 
markets and analysts.  Concern persists about the 
sustainability of Turkey\'s debt, however.  Analysts suggest 
any problem is unlikely to emerge immediately, as banks will 
remain in the market and move to shore up their balance 
sheets at the end of the quarter and cooperate with the 
government to bring interest rates down.  The key wildcard 
that could hinder that effort: individual bank\'s dollar 
liquidity.  One banking contact estimates that 5 percent of 
the system\'s 44 billion USD in assets has been withdrawn or 
transferred overseas in recent days, a figure confirmed in 
Ankara by BRSA sources (septel).  Other banks report that 
after an initial \"leakage\" on the first day of hostilities, 
the situation has stabilized.  Banking industry leaders 
reviewed the situation in Ankara on March 26 with the 
Treasury, Central Bank and BRSA.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) No credibility: Our contacts in Istanbul\'s financial 
community are extremely critical of the AK government and its 
mishandling of U.S. relations on Iraq.  Its mixed signals on 
reintroducing the motions to support the U.S., and the 
perception that State Minister Babacan deliberately misled 
the markets before the Treasury\'s last debt auction, have 
left its credibility in shreds.  The distrust was evident 
over the weekend as Prime Minister Erdogan\'s message of 
commitment to economic reform failed to sway market 
sentiment.  Analysts at Bender Securities argue that \"this 
government is finished.\"  But, of equal concern, many 
perceive that the problem extends beyond the government. 
Yapi Kredi\'s Huseyin Imece characterizes the failure as one 
in which the entire Turkish state shares responsibility, from 
the President and military through the oppositin as well. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Isolation: Beyond the loss f American financial 
assistance, which some see s survivable (Finansbank\'s Kerim 
Kemahli notes tat Turkey was expected to muddle through 
before he package appeared, and can still do so), concern 
among Istanbul observers focused especially on a erception 
that Turkey\'s bridges to the West and articularly to the 
U.S. have been cut.  EU warnigs on Cyprus, coupled with 
warnings from all quaters against Turkish intervention in 
Northern Ira (\"the last error remaining for Turkey to 
commit\" in Imece\'s description), shook the markets and 
contributed to 
nday\'s sharp sell-off.  Tuesday\'sreport of 
a new and more modest U.S. assistance ackage has thus been 
seized on as a lifeline.  Analysts recognize that the amount 
(in the Turkish ontext) is relatively insignificant, and 
congresional approval by no means assured, but nonetheless, 
in Kemahli\'s and others\' view, the aid is an important signal 
that the U.S. administration is not abandoning Turkey. 
(Garanti Bank\'s Baris Kokoglu argued that even a promise of 
billions from the EU would have less market impact than the 
U.S. billion.) 
 
 
4. (SBU) Debt Sustainability: All observers are now focused 
on interest rates, Turkey\'s key economic indicator.  While 
pessimism is marked at local brokerages (Bender\'s Murat 
Gulkan and Emin Ozturk see an economy trying to navigate 
between muddling through and \"doomsday,\" with no real 
upside), some bankers are more sanguine.  Kemahli argues that 
the \"moderate\" reaction of the past week shows that the 
Turkish economy has matured since the 2001 crisis, and will 
weather the storm.  The banking sector is strong, he argues, 
with banks liquid and without exposure to short positions on 
the dollar.  Banks are taking paper losses because current 
high rates negatively impact their balance sheet, but he and 
his colleague Ozlem Cinemre characterize this more as an 
\"opportunity cost,\" in that deposit rates are so low the 
banks are still making money on their entire portfolio. 
Garanti\'s Kokoglu agrees, noting further that the banks have 
no alternative but to stay in the bond market.  There is no 
demand in the real sector for loans, reserve requirements 
provide an incentive for bond holdings over loans in any 
case, and other securities (such as U.S. bonds) do not offer 
a high enough return to cover Turkish deposit rates.  Bender 
analysts characterize the situation as a \"Hotel California,\" 
where all players are enjoying good profits, but cannot exit 
the game. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Dollar liquidity: Given that ten banks constitute 
the key market for Turkish t-bills, their liquidity is 
critical to debt turnover.  On this issue, we are hearing 
mixed messages.  Yapi\'s Huseyin Imece warned that \"leakage\" 
from the system has reached 5 percent of its 44 billion USD 
in total dollar assets, a figure confirmed by BRSA\'s Engin 
Akcakoca, who told Embassy Ankara (see Ankara septel) that FX 
withdrawals from March 14-15 totaled 1.8 billion USD.  Not 
all banks are being equally affected, however.  Cinemre and 
Kemahli noted that while there were some withdrawals on the 
first day of military operations in Iraq (2 percent of the 
Finansbank\'s 1.8 billion USD holdings), the situation had 
since stabilized and that on Wednesday there was even a 20 
million USD inflow.  They noted too that withdrawals were not 
driven by panic, as they were 2 years ago (when Finans was 
forced to turn to merchants in the Grand Bazaar and its 
German branches for stopgap liquidity), but by large 
depositors comparison shopping in pursuit of increased 
returns.  Kokoglu reported a similar pattern at Garanti. 
However, he confirmed that the CEO\'s of major banks were 
meeting in Ankara on March 26 with the BRSA, Central Bank, 
and Treasury to review the situation and emphasized the 
importance of Turkey\'s continued commitment to its reform 
program.  The government no longer has any margin for error, 
he stressed, and the markets will \"swiftly punish\" any 
missteps. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: From the Istanbul perspective, what started 
as an extremely problematic week has been salvaged by the 
public perception that the U.S. is not abandoning Turkey. 
Analysts are united in their belief that to further soothe 
the markets Turkey should avoid raising tensions by going 
into Northern Iraq.  After the announcement of U.S. 
assistance, they also see value in a reciprical goodwill 
gesture by Turkey--such as opening airbases-- without seeking 
a quid pro quo.  Most of all, they are looking for actions 
rather than words from the government on the economy.  We 
were struck, however, by the dividing line between the views 
of Istanbul\'s bankers and stock market analysts.  While the 
latter are uniformly gloomy, some of the former were more 
sanguine--convinced that Turkey has seen worse before and 
will ultimately weather the crisis, provided the war is short 
and the government continues to follow IMF guidance.  End 
Comment.

Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) & (d) 
 
 
1. (C) In separate March 26 meetings, Istanbul contacts 
confirmed that illegal foreign prostitution in Istanbul 
remains widespread, and that criminal networks, and possibly 
even corrupted officials, have a lucrative stake in the 
business.   Marmara University sociologist professor Nilufer 
Narli told poloff that foreign prostitution, particularly 
involving \"Russians,\" remains widespread in various 
neighborhoods of Istanbul (Note: Such women are generally 
Moldovan, but also come from the other countries in the 
region.  End Note).  In addition to cheap hotels and bars 
which play host to foreign prostitution in Taksim, Laleli, 
and Aksaray, Sisli District Governor Osman Demir confirmed 
that  prostitution is also widespread in the night clubs of 
the Elmadag neighborhhod in Sisli.  Asked how many of these 
women might have been involuntarily forced into this work, 
both Narli and Demir said that the overwhelming majority work 
voluntarily.  Demir maintained that many are primarily 
\"suitcase traders,\" who simply \"raise capital\" by engaging in 
prostitution on the side.  Narli said that her research had 
not found many such women, although she admitted that there 
are probably some young women who are lured to Istanbul under 
the expectation that they will engage in other work (as 
waitresses, maids, or babysitters), and are pressured into 
prostitution by economic circumstances or even by force. 
 
 
2. (C) Both Demir and Narli said that criminal groups have a 
major stake in the prostitution business.  Demir (who 
oversees the security apparatus for the Sisli district) told 
poloff that he believes both local and international groups 
are involved.  In addition to the mafia elements, Narli added 
that there are \"undoubtedly\" corrupt officials who profit 
from these illegal activities.  She pointed to the fact that 
some of the hotels and other establishments where such 
prostitution occurs are even owned by retired police 
officials.  The fact that even the highest levels of Turkish 
society use such prostitutes (or at least the exclusive 
high-end \"escorts\"), Narli suggested, may be why such illegal 
activities are tolerated.  Separately, Demir noted that the 
sharp disparity between the economic prospects such women 
face at home compared with what they can earn in Istanbul 
will always make it difficult for the authorities to control 
such activities. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Comment: These remarks largely track with what we 
had understood to be the situation here in Istanbul.  It is 
interesting that both of these contacts raised the subject on 
their own in meetings on other subjects, suggesting to us 
that our contacts are increasingly aware of our concerns 
regarding trafficking in persons.

Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: While not quite so pessimistic as they 
were two weeks ago about Turkey\'s immediate economic 
prospects, Istanbul financial analysts remain decidedly 
gloomy about the country\'s mid-term future.  All agree that 
the Treasury seems to have next week\'s debt auction well in 
hand.  In the mid-term, however, there is consensus that 30 
percent real interest rates are not sustainable, and will 
shift for better or worse.  Though an upside is \"technically 
possible,\" in the words of former Disbank Chairman Vural 
Akisik, such an evolution would require government 
credibility in the markets, currently a sorely lacking 
commodity.  Akisik and others stressed that at root (and 
counterintuitively) the problem is not fiscal.  Turkey today 
enjoys the best economic fundamentals it has had in a decade. 
 But without unstinting government commitment to 
half-heartedly accepted and long-delayed structural reforms, 
interest rates will not come down to a sustainable level. 
End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Less short-term angst...: In a round of meetings 
during the week of March 31 with visiting Ankara DCM, Ankara 
Econ Counselor, and Istanbul Pol/Econ Chief, financial and 
real sector interlocutors indicated that their concerns had 
eased about the short-term sustainability of Turkey\'s debt. 
All agreed that the Treasury should be able to roll over the 
4.8 quadrillion TL in treasury bills that come due on April 
9.  Analysts point to several factors: most importantly, the 
country\'s sentiment-driven markets, initally alarmed by a 
perceived breach in U.S.-Turkish relations at a time the 
country appeared increasingly isolated in Europe, have been 
calmed by Secretary Powell\'s visit and the proposed 1 billion 
USD assistance package.  A range of technical factors also 
provide a safety margin to the Treasury: tax collections in 
March and April should provide some ready cash, while the 
state banks (little used in recent auctions)  can step in as 
a last resort. 
 
 
3. (SBU) ...but long-term gloom: Our interlocutors concurred, 
however, that in the medium to long-term it is hard to be 
hopeful.  ING Barings Managing Director John McCarthy noted 
that given the current situation, one is \"stretched for 
positive arguments\" about Turkey\'s situation.  With the 
economy at a standstill, the country is coming to a \"dark 
time,\" he warned, and will have to seriously face up to the 
structural issues it has long ducked, or face a crisis along 
the lines of Mexico in the 1990s.  Others were similarly 
pessimistic--Bender analysts Murat Gulkan and Emin Ozturk see 
\"muddling through\" as the best case scenario for Turkey, and 
can see no scenario for growth in the mid-term.  Ozturk noted 
that there are few engines for growth this year (only exports 
seem poised for a positive performance, while consumption, 
public sector investment and tourism are all down), and a 
business decision to draw down inventories (which accounted 
for a large proportion of the growth in the fourth quarter of 
2002) could cause the economy to contract. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Positive fundamentals, but: Gulkan and Ozturk 
stressed that at root the problem is not fiscal, given that 
Turkey currently enjoys the best economic fundamentals it has 
seen in a decade.  Continued strong performance on the fiscal 
side is a necessary but not sufficient condition for turning 
the economy around.  Instead, they argued, the government 
must stop sending mixed signals to the markets and instead 
push the reform program wholeheartedly.  Former Disbank 
Chairman Vural Akisik echoed this point, noting that Turkey\'s 
macro base is better than it has been since 1994.  Because of 
that, observers believe the government can get through the 
next months by \"spending the ammunition\" it has accumulated. 
But to achieve a sustainable real interest rate (which Akisik 
calculates at 35 percent), the government must have 
credibility with the markets, something that is now almost 
totally lacking.  Reviewing the missed opportunities and 
missteps that have characterized the last few months, Akisik 
likened the situation to that of a husband who has cheated on 
his wife and now even when guiltless must pay attention to 
every nuance.  In such a situation it is not enough that the 
government get the main issues right--the details must be 
perfect too. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Captive audience: Many of our interlocutors concur 
that ultimately a restructuring of Turkey\'s domestic debt-- 
either orderly or chaotic--is inevitable.  They do not expect 
it soon, however.  Most believe that the government can 
sustain the debt through 2003.  Questions deepen for the 
following years, and one leading international bank has 
adjusted its baseline scenario to reflect a 2005 default as 
the most likely outcome.  HSBC General Manager Antika concurs 
that restructuring is inevitable, but she (and the bank\'s 
Treasurer) do not see it happening this year.   Indeed, she 
noted that HSBC\'s own interests militate against such a 
development, in that they mirror (though to a lesser degree) 
the predicament of the sector as a whole.  With exposure to 
Turkish debt both on its balance sheet and in collateral for 
corporate loans, as HSBC\'s Treasurer told us, \"we have an 
interest in keeping the boat afloat, not in profiteering from 
the situation.\"  Other banks\' situation is similar.  Bender\'s 
Ozturk and Gulkan stressed (as they have repeatedly in recent 
months) that Turkish banks are captives of the system, and 
are essentially prevented from cashing out, since a decision 
by one bank to do so could bring the whole \"house of cards\" 
down. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Restructuring: Intriguingly, however, we heard this 
week our first hint that the banks themselves may be 
receptive to some sort of controlled restructuring, in an 
effort to escape the treadmill on which they find themselves. 
 Bank of New York Representative Neslihan Tombul told us on 
April 3 that she has heard that at least two banks (Isbank 
and Garanti) have sent feelers to the Treasury on the 
subject.  Beyond the costs a restructuring might impose, 
depending on how it is formulated, she also sees benefits, in 
that with longer-term securities banks have a more stable 
balance sheet on which to operate. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: With reassurance on U.S.-Turkish ties 
helping to soothe Turkish markets in the short term, 
attention is again focused on the key imponderable of 
government credibility.  We see little sign that the 
government will be able to recoup that commodity any time 
soon.  Given its missteps, each government move has been 
closely scrutinized, and in many cases (as in the case of 
recent nominations to the board of Halkbank and Ziraat Bank) 
found wanting.  Most Istanbul analysts remain decidedly 
downbeat on the government economic team, expressing grudging 
respect only for Finance Minister Unakitan.  Only by reaching 
outside the government for a \"Dervis,\" in Gulkan and Ozturk\'s 
view, can the government regain credibility.  They (and we) 
see this as an extremely remote possibility, however.  End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL WORRIES ABOUT WAR, U.S.-TURKEY TIES, 
ECONOMY 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: With apparently over ninety percent of the 
local population opposed to the war in Iraq, anti-war 
sentiment in Istanbul continues to harden as reports and 
images of civilian casualties stream in over the sympathetic 
news networks.  Among Istanbul\'s academic and business elite, 
however, fears of a breakdown in U.S.-Turkish relations and 
its consequences for Turkey have replaced Iraq as the primary 
concern.  The only issue that seems to span the sharp divide 
between the concerns of the man in the street and the elite 
is a shared nervousness about the government\'s ability to 
manage an already-battered economy in the face of additional 
shocks from the war.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Media coverage of the coalition operations in Iraq has 
largely reinforced the prevailing anti-war sentiment in 
Istanbul.  Local television stations have focused 
predominantly on civilian casualties, reports of coalition 
setbacks, and regional opposition to the war.  Although our 
contacts with average Turks have elicited responses ranging 
from apathy to antipathy, the general mood among 
working-class (and unemployed) Istanbul residents remains 
decidedly anti-war.  Pointing to the coalition\'s failure to 
find evidence of chemical and biological weapons, almost all 
Turks here question the U.S.\'s justification for war. 
Students stubbornly cling to their mantra of \"no blood for 
oil,\" while residents of more conservative and religious 
neighborhoods voice their concerns about an \"anti-Muslim 
crusade.\"  Although very few have a kind word to say about 
Saddam and his regime, they point gloomily to the 
difficulties involved in managing a post-Saddam Iraq and the 
regional resentment that is being provoked by the U.S.\'s 
presence. 
 
 
3. (U) The preoccupations of our business, academic and media 
contacts, however, have shifted dramatically in recent days. 
Following weeks of negotiations and the parliament\'s refusal 
to allow the U.S. to transport troops and equipment to 
northern Iraq, the Istanbul elite is now focused on the 
\"crisis\" in U.S.-Turkish relations.  Discussions of \"what 
went wrong?\", \"who is to blame?\", and \"is the strategic 
partnership dead?\" have replaced arguments over whether the 
war in Iraq is justified.  At an April 2 Marmara Group 
conference on U.S.-Turkish relations, a panel of retired 
generals, senior diplomats, and business leaders skirted the 
case for war, but came out strongly in favor of maintaining 
the strategic partnership.  Former Foreign Minister Emre 
Gonensay argued that, given its friendship with the U.S., 
Turkey should have stood by the U.S. in Iraq.  Echoing the 
comments of other panelists, retired General Necdet Timur 
remarked that two months of disagreement cannot be allowed to 
undermine a 50-year old strategic relationship. 
 
 
4. (U) The only unifying theme in our discussions throughout 
Istanbul has been the universal, even overriding, concern 
about the fragile economic situation.  \"Turkey must solve its 
economic problems... without a healthy economy, foreign 
policy is irrelevant,\" said former diplomat and DYP Vice 
Chairman Mehmet Ali Bayar at the Marmara Group conference. 
Investment analysts, bankers, and economists are skeptical 
about the AK government\'s ability to implement the IMF 
program.  Many of them now argue that the risk of loan 
default or restructuring has risen.  Sentiment has improved 
in the wake of Secretary Powell\'s visit and the renewed 
prospect for U.S. assistance, but all eyes are on AK\'s 
economic efforts.  Almost everyone worries about the 
potentially damaging impact that the war in Iraq is likely to 
have on Turkey\'s economy.  Local merchants and restaurant 
owners claim they are already feeling the pinch of 
contracting tourism.  Grocers, taxi drivers, security guards, 
and other working-class Turks in Istanbul bemoan their 
economic plight and hope for a rapid conclusion to the war.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL STUDENTS VOICE NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF 
WAR IN IRAQ 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Istanbul pol/econoffs hosted a group of 11 
students from Istanbul\'s Beykent University to discuss 
current political developments in the Middle East and the 
Turkish/U.S. relationship.  The students were unanimously 
opposed to the war.  However, the group demonstrated a 
nuanced understanding of the U.S./Turkish relationship and a 
belief that, though they disagree with the war, the press in 
Turkey and the Middle East has dealt with U.S. policy in a 
sensationalist manner.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) On April 1, Pol/econoffs hosted a group of 11 students 
from newly-established Beykent University\'s English Language 
Department.  The students (9 women and 2 men) were largely 
interested in pursuing careers in translation, teaching, 
further study in literature, and public relations. 
Geographically, most were raised in Istanbul, though two grew 
up in the Southeast, one on the Black Sea coast, and several 
others lived for many years in the Aegean region.  One of the 
girls wore a headscarf (technically not permitted in 
universities by the Higher Board of Education, but often 
ignored at private universities).  Two of the students were 
dual nationals: one Turkish-American, and one Turkish-Israeli. 
 
 
------------- 
War and Media 
------------- 
 
 
3. (U) Though the subject of the war in Iraq took up only a 
portion of the two-hour discussion, students immediately 
stated, unanimously, that they were against the war. 
However, they were quick to distance themselves from any 
sympathy with the Iraqi regime.  In essence, one student 
said, the decision to act without a clearer UN mandate, and 
not give inspections further time, was what they disagreed 
with. 
 
 
4. (U) When asked about media coverage in Turkey, students 
acknowledged that the U.S. had been subject to a host of wild 
conspiracy theories.  Students pointed to fanciful press 
articles, such as: allegations that the new consulate\'s 
location has a darker purpose (one paper suggested that the 
location was perfect for monitoring traffic on the Bosphorus; 
another said flights to Ataturk International Airport would 
be monitored from \"the hilltop fortress\"); visa and 
immigration policies were specifically anti-Muslim; and U.S. 
interest in Turkey\'s Southeast is to encourage an independent 
Kurdistan.  Students pointed out that, ultimately, Turks were 
harmed by the sensationalist approach of the media. 
 
 
------------------- 
American Intentions 
------------------- 
 
 
5. (U) Poloff asked whether the students believed the United 
States was \"well-intentioned\" in using military force against 
Saddam.  Most of the students did not offer a clear opinion 
in either direction: one said he believed the American people 
meant well, but that military commanders might be less 
well-intentioned.  Another student said that while she had 
questions about U.S. motives, she knew that \"Saddam is no 
saint.\"  The question of civilian casualties, heavily 
reported in Turkish media, weighed heavily on the students\' 
minds. 
 
 
---------------- 
AKP and the Vote 
---------------- 
 
 
6. (U) Pointing to the failed Turkish Parliament vote to 
allow U.S. troops to transit Turkey for Northern Iraq, 
several students said AKP\'s \"mismanagement\" was to blame for 
the narrow defeat.  Students also pointed to \"playing 
politics for too long\" as a concern, blaming the military, 
CHP, and AKP for the miscalculation and subsequent damage to 
U.S.-Turkish relations.  At the same time, several students 
said, they believe the long-term U.S.-Turkish relationship 
will remain strong. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
7. (U) Students displayed both a healthy skepticism of local 
press coverage and a nuanced understanding of political 
machinations in Ankara.  Unprompted, the students offered an 
analysis of AK which was highly refined: balancing populist 
promises to their supporters while trying to grapple with 
complex international relationships and economic management.

SUBJECT: SUB-GOVERNORS SURVEY SECURITY AND POLITICS IN 
ISTANBUL 
 
Classified By: CG David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: In recent meetings, several of Istanbul\'s 
kaymakams (sub-governors) were surprisingly open in 
describing the challenges they face in overseeing proper 
functioning of the security apparatus.  Pointing to a massive 
rural-urban migration to Istanbul over the past several 
decades as a central source of difficulty, the kaymakams 
discussed their concerns related to street children and 
crimes committed by minors; proper handling of demonstrations 
and protests; rural-urban migration; and improving police 
training.  All were eager to underline their firm belief that 
Turkey and the U.S. would remain close allies and friends 
despite recent difficulties in the relationship.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Istanbul\'s Sub-Districts 
------------------------ 
 
 
2. (U)  Poloff recently met with kaymakams for Bagcilar, 
Sisli, and Kadikoy districts in Istanbul.  The three 
districts, very different in terms of income levels, 
commercial interests, and location, roughly mirror the 
diversity of economic conditions among Istanbul\'s 
12-million-plus population.  Bagcilar, located on the 
northwestern edge of Istanbul\'s European side, is a classic 
gecekondu (literally \"landed at night,\" a neighborhood of 
recent arrivals to the city, often interspersed with 
squatters and small businesses).  Sisli, in central European 
Istanbul, has both a thriving commercial district and 
residential areas spanning the entire range of incomes, from 
very poor to affluent.  Its population of 300,000 people 
swells to one million during the day, as workers crowd in 
from outlying areas.  Kadikoy, a central district on the 
Asian side, has a variety of retail and commercial 
businesses, a pedestrian neighborhood and shoreline area 
popular with locals, and a largely middle-class residential 
area. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
Bagcilar and Gaziosmanpasa 
-------------------------- 
 
 
3. (C) Poloff met April 3 with Bagcilar\'s acting kaymakam, 
Aziz Inci.  Inci said that most residents of neighborhoods 
like Bagcilar are immigrants from Turkey\'s rural areas and 
Southeast, with few adults born in Istanbul.  Inci believes 
that most come to Istanbul for economic reasons, and that 
\"security reasons\" as a justification for migration ended in 
about 1995. 
 
 
4. (U) Inci views the primary challenge of his job as one of 
providing infrastructure.  Working to solve shortcomings in 
education, health, and social services, and combating 
joblessness, are his main preoccupations.  In order to make 
necessary improvements, as kaymakam he must often work not 
only with the governor\'s office, but also with neighboring 
kaymakams and the Istanbul mayor in order to deal with 
cross-cutting issues such as electricity, transportation, and 
sewage. 
 
 
5. (C) One way in which kaymakams come into direct contact 
with political parties is through such development projects. 
Inci said that local political party offices often show 
interest when the kaymakam is making decisions on where to 
improve infrastructure, or whom to hire for certain 
contracts.  Additionally, political parties seek to 
\"bandwagon\" onto successful projects, claiming them as their 
own initiatives to score points with the local electorate. 
 
 
----- 
Sisli 
----- 
 
 
6. (C) Sisli kaymakam Osman Demir also pointed to 
infrastructure development as a key need for Istanbul\'s 
social development, and also as a means of enhancing 
security.  Demir expressed concern about what he perceives to 
be a growing pattern of criminal activities among minors. 
Demir pointed to economic hard times, a burgeoning youth 
population, and lighter punishments on young offenders as 
causes of this problem.  Demir believes some criminal 
elements are recruiting minors to avoid harsher punishments. 
 
 
7. (C) Demir pointed to a continuing presence of illegal 
immigrants in Istanbul as a major problem.  Sisli has a 
number of night clubs in the Elmadag neighborhood that have 
performers and some prostitutes from the former Soviet Union. 
 Additionally, garment and leather businesses in the 
Nisantasi neighborhood cater to suitcase traders from the 
same countries, and signs in Russian are nearly as frequent 
as Turkish or English. 
 
 
8. (C) Demir argued that trafficking in Istanbul is largely 
voluntary.  He laid out several \"typical\" scenarios, which 
include Chinese workers attempting to enter Europe by 
transiting Istanbul, and women from the former Soviet Union 
working as shuttle traders in Istanbul, and occasionally 
\"raising capital\" by engaging in prostitution.  Demir felt 
that both local and international mafia have a hand in this 
ongoing problem, but that economic under-development in 
neighboring countries was its major impetus.  (As kaymakam, 
Demir oversees the security apparatus for the Sisli district, 
and has intimate personal knowledge of all significant 
arrests, detentions, and police investigations within the 
area.) 
 
 
------- 
Kadikoy 
------- 
 
 
9. (C) Kadikoy Kaymakam Yuksel Peker was surprisingly frank 
about problems of police administration and human rights. 
Peker conceded that torture in Turkey is still a problem, but 
argued it can be solved by proper education.  \"Police, in 
their zeal to extract information, believe that torture is 
the best option.  Training them in other methods of proper 
interrogation will stop them,\" he suggested. 
 
 
10. (C) Peker, like his other colleagues, believed that many 
of Istanbul\'s current social ills are caused by severe 
pressures brought about by massive rural-urban migration.  He 
echoed their belief that infrastructural improvements will do 
much to ease these pressures, and encourage law-abiding 
behavior. 
 
 
------------------ 
What\'s a kaymakam? 
------------------ 
 
 
11. (U) Kaymakams (sub-governors) are chiefs of Ministry of 
the Interior offices in Turkey\'s provincial sub-divisions, 
and thus formally the chief representatives of the Turkish 
State below the level of governors.  Career civil servants, 
they must be university graduates of public administration or 
political affairs faculties.  They may be graduates of either 
public or private universities.   Upon graduation, they take 
an entrance exam to enter the kaymakam program, and then 
begin an approximately one-month training program at the 
Ministry of the Interior in Ankara.  Kaymakams generally 
aspire eventually to be appointed as governors.  Early in 
their careers, they usually do a one-year training program in 
the U.S. or U.K. to study Anglo-Saxon local administration. 
 
 
12. (C) A kaymakam\'s career usually moves geographically from 
East to West.  After completing MoI training in Ankara, a 
young kaymakam is typically posted somewhere in the rural 
southeast.  Throughout the region, kaymakams are generally 
young men in their late-20s to early 30s.  Though technically 
in charge of the security apparatus throughout the 
sub-district (sometimes a very large geographic area), 
kaymakams in this period of their careers are heavily 
supervised by governors and deputy governors in the 
provincial capitals.  At the same time, they are somewhat 
eclipsed by a security apparatus that, while respectful to 
them as the future governors of Turkey, keeps them somewhat 
distant from direct control over jandarma and other security 
operations.  On one occasion, poloff met with a jandarma 
colonel and kaymakam simultaneously.  While technically of 
higher rank, the kaymakam was deferential to the colonel, who 
was both older and more experienced. 
 
 
13. (C) A young kaymakam understands his limitations: he is a 
colonel without a regiment, charged not with independent 
decision making on security matters, but with communicating 
the governor\'s instructions to the local security apparatus, 
and reporting back on the local situation.  \"Do well in small 
matters and you will be rewarded\" is the order of the day.  A 
young kaymakam looks to onward assignment as a deputy 
governor or a kaymakam in a more comfortable location.  On 
more than one occasion, young kaymakams and deputy governors 
asked poloff about an American FSO\'s career track, and 
claimed to see strong similarities. 
 
 
14. (U) As a kaymakam\'s career progresses, the geography 
changes, with postings in Turkey\'s coastal areas and larger 
cities.  While poloff estimates that median age for a 
kaymakam in the rural Southeast is just over 30 years old, 
Istanbul\'s kaymakams average close to 50.  Previous posts for 
kaymakams poloff spoke with in Istanbul include the Aegean 
area, Ankara and Istanbul. 
15. (C) MoI civil servants who pursue this career path 
typically display an awareness of Turkish ethnic and 
geographical diversity that may be lost on many of the 
Ankara-Istanbul elite and even on many governors.  While 
typically Kemalist in outlook, they often exhibit a clear 
understanding of the problems that have given rise to 
conflict and political instability.  Uniformly, when speaking 
about political unrest in both rural and urban settings, 
kaymakams have stressed to poloff their belief in the 
importance of opportunity for Kurdish and Turkish poor, 
stating that they believe their role in apportioning funds 
for development projects to be very important in enhancing 
security and discouraging extremism.  Improvements in 
education, state-funded health care, and physical 
infrastructure are thus key concerns for kaymakams throughout 
Turkey.

SUBJECT: POWER AT ANY PRICE? CEM UZAN\'S POLITICAL AMBITIONS 
 
 
REF: ANKARA 2516 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Initial contacts with Youth Party (GP) 
officials in Istanbul confirm our belief that the party is 
essentially a vehicle of convenience for media tycoon Cem 
Uzan\'s considerable political ambitions.  At the same time, 
GP is not resting on its laurels, but instead is moving 
quickly to build up a grass-roots presence throughout 
Istanbul, while Cem Uzan himself is reaching out to 
mainstream Turkish politicians ) including independent 
Istanbul Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna.  Istanbul politicians 
believe that GP\'s electoral performance in November was no 
flash-in-the-pan, and that Uzan and his party are in politics 
for the long haul.  End Summary. 
 
 
New Kid on the Block 
-------------------- 
2. (C) The November 2002 elections virtually wiped the 
Istanbul political landscape clean, leaving just two parties 
represented in parliament from Istanbul as elsewhere.  Even 
the center-right Motherland Party (ANAP), which had long 
relied on Istanbul as a solid voter base, could only manage 
4.6 percent here.  The newly-formed Youth Party (GP), 
however, despite a late slump in the polls, managed to 
capture 8.3 percent of the Istanbul vote (improving on the 
7.5 percent they received nationally).  As the heir-apparent 
of one of Turkey\'s wealthiest, and most unscrupulous, 
family-owned conglomerates, GP chairman and media tycoon Cem 
Uzan was already well known before he entered politics. 
Rumors suggest that the firm began as a small construction 
outfit that ballooned in size as a result of illicit dealings 
and money-laundering with the Qadaffi Libyan government. 
Whether these rumors are true or false, almost all Istanbul 
residents we have spoken to take the Uzans\' unscrupulous 
reputation for granted.  While the USD 3 billion fraud case 
leveled by Motorola and Nokia against the Uzan family further 
enhanced their notoriety, most Istanbul Turks also remember 
how Uzan-owned Star Television won, and then reneged on, the 
contract to broadcast the premier Turkish soccer league 
games, but not before selling thousands of decoder boxes and 
non-refundable subscriptions. 
 
 
Local Billionaire Trying to Do Good? 
------------------------------------ 
3. (C) Despite his family\'s unsavory reputation, Cem Uzan 
appears to have made a successful transition to politics.  In 
fact, some Istanbul contacts feel Uzan\'s personal wealth is a 
political asset (i.e., \"With more money than he knows what to 
do with, (Uzan) is unlikely to fall prey to the corruption 
that other politicians engage in\").  Uzan also generously 
funded his own political campaign.  A former top Star 
executive told poloff that Uzan spent USD 40 million of his 
personal fortune (Note: Others have put the figure as high as 
USD 100 million.  End Note).  Whatever the total, Uzan made a 
splash during the campaign by enlisting big-name music icons 
to provide \"free\" concerts during his rallies and reportedly 
offering free Telsim mobile phones to active supporters. 
Uzan also hired well-known Istanbul advertising executive Ali 
Taran not merely to produce GP\'s advertisements, but, 
according to a former Taran associate, to craft his entire 
public image to appeal to a wide, untapped voter base.  The 
result was a finely-calibrated message combining populist 
calls for lower taxes and higher spending with an 
anti-Western, anti-IMF patriotic appeal to Turkish national 
pride.  Since the elections, Uzan continued his spending 
ways, blanketing Istanbul newspapers, television and radio 
with another carefully-crafted nationalistic message firmly 
opposing the U.S.-led war against Iraq, clearly another 
populist effort to play to the vast majority who opposed the 
war.  Nor did Uzan limit the campaign to his own media 
channels.  GP Vice Chairman Tugba Kalafatoglu told poloff on 
April 10 that they paid triple the going rate for advertising 
space in rival Dogan group newspapers. 
 
 
Building From the Bottom Up and the Top Down 
-------------------------------------------- 
4. (C) Istanbul Youth Party (GP) Chairman Hasan Bakkal 
admitted to poloff on April 9 that GP had not been ready for 
early elections and had barely enough time to establish a 
token skeleton infrastructure in each of Istanbul\'s 
districts.  GP had its first local party congress in February 
(where Bakkal himself was elected the chairman of a 60-person 
board) and has been working to develop a serious grassroots 
infrastructure throughout the city.  Separately, City Council 
Motherland Party (ANAP) Group President Recai Delibasioglu 
told poloff that 12 of ANAP\'s Istanbul district chairmen had 
defected to GP since the elections.  Bakkal\'s provincial 
headquarters, for example, will move to new, larger office 
space in the next few weeks to accommodate its growing staff. 
 Bakkal estimated (while freely admitting that he did not 
have hard numbers) that GP has 150,000 registered volunteers 
in Istanbul.  He told poloff that he hopes to have GP 
volunteers personally visit between 65 and 70 percent of 
Istanbul households by the end of the year.  On the critical 
issue of finances, Bakkal claimed that GP is relying 
exclusively on small donations from party members.  Bakkal 
expressed skepticism regarding the possibility that GP will 
receive government funds (Note: According to existing Turkish 
laws, based on its recent electoral performance, GP should 
now be entitled to annual disbursements of government funds. 
End Note). 
 
 
5. (C) While building from the bottom, GP is also looking to 
recruit mainstream politicians at the top.  On April 9, 
former State Minister and two-term True Path Party (DYP) 
parliamentarian Ufuk Soylemez formally joined the Youth Party 
(reftel).  Meanwhile, Bakkal confirmed to poloff that GP has 
also invited independent Istanbul Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna to 
join the party.  Bakkal claimed that Gurtuna is close to GP, 
but admitted that he has not yet made a decision.  (Note: We 
had heard this from a number of other reliable sources as 
well.  See septel for further details.  End Note).  Others 
have told us that they too have been approached by GP, 
including former Istanbul Mayor Bedrettin Dalan, former 
Ambassador and Ozal Adviser Kaya Toperi, and ANAP City 
Council Group President Recai Delibasioglu. Bakkal said that 
GP has been flooded with applicants, but that they are 
turning away all but the \"best.\" Delibasioglu confirmed to 
poloff that the lack of viable political alternatives has 
given GP the luxury to be selective. 
 
 
Whither GP? 
----------- 
6. (C) GP is already looking forward to the upcoming April 
2004 local elections, with a particular eye on the biggest 
prize of all, Istanbul.  Our contacts here believe that GP\'s 
electoral success was no mere flash-in-the-pan and that Cem 
Uzan is here to stay.  Motivated more by personal ambition 
than ideological convictions, many Istanbul politicians, like 
some of their colleagues elsewhere, are already trying to 
catch GP\'s rising star.  Our contacts predict that this trend 
will accelerate if the AK government is unable to manage the 
formidable political and economic challenges ahead. 
 
 
7. (C)  What about Cem Uzan himself?  Former Star executive 
and Uzan associate Aydin Ozdalga assured poloff that Cem Uzan 
personally is unlikely to run for local office, even for the 
influential position of Istanbul mayor.  His ambitions lie 
much higher.  As for his ideological convictions, Ozdalga and 
others believe that Uzan\'s anti-Western, populist rhetoric is 
skin-deep; were he to come to power, he would in all 
likelihood adopt more moderate policies.  GP Vice Chairman 
Kalafatoglu made a similar argument, citing more modest, 
nuanced rhetoric in recent GP advertising. 
 
 
8. (C) Comment: GP has made significant inroads in Istanbul 
with its nationalist bent and openly populist rhetoric, but 
the party still has its work cut out for it.  For those 
Istanbul politicians that place political ambition above 
personal ideology, joining such a party would be acceptable 
if such a move seemed politically fortuitous.  Consequently, 
many are in a waiting mode to see how the AK government fares 
in the coming months before deciding which way to jump. 
Altough some believe that the GP rhetoric is based more on 
political opportunism than any deep ideological conviction, 
it remains to be seen whether Cem Uzan and GP will moderate 
their tone in future elections or if they can eventually come 
to power. 
 
 
9. (C) Embassy Note: Cem Uzan and the GP appear to modify 
their rhetoric according to regions.  As such, their approach 
in Istanbul is likely to reflect a more urbane approach, at 
least at the top.  Nationally, the party is uniformly more 
extreme in its opportunism; our contacts to date give us no 
reason to conclude that Uzan and GP will moderate their tone 
or policies if they come to office.

SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S BANKING SECTOR: ON FIRMER GROUND, BUT NOT 
OUT OF THE WOODS 
 
 
This is a joint Ankara-Istanbul cable.  Sensitive but 
Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: Industry and government contacts in 
Istanbul and Ankara concur that Turkey\'s banking sector has 
improved considerably since the 2001 crisis.  Government 
moves to impose effective and independent oversight through 
the creation of the Banking Regulatory and Supervision Agency 
(BRSA) in September 2000 increased transparency and public 
confidence.  The takeover and resolution of 19 insolvent 
banks, and partial restructuring of public banks, have 
eliminated unfair competition and eliminated the worst 
performers.  Most concur, however, that serious problems 
remain, and that the sector remains extremely fragile, with 
bank exposure not just to individual balance sheet problems, 
but also to systemic risk as a result of Turkey\'s tenuous 
macroeconomic fundamentals.  Turkish banks operate more as 
hedge funds than commercial lenders, with government 
securities making up a higher percentage (an average of 40 
percent) of their assets than loans.  Having gotten into the 
government securities game, however, the banks have no easy 
exit, other than through a long-range strategy of increasing 
their capital and growing out of the problem.  However, the 
quick end to war in Iraq, and declining interest rates have 
given the sector some breathing room, providing profits in 
place of the heavy paper losses that March\'s high rates 
caused.  In the medium term, the sector needs increased 
capitalization, either through foreign direct investment or 
public offerings.  Either solution involves diluting 
ownership of family-owned businesses, however, which will 
face traditional barriers.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Snapshot of the Sector: Turkey\'s banking sector is 
small by world standards, with total assets at the end of 
2001 of only USD 122 billion.  Forty percent of that total is 
accounted for by three state banks: Ziraat, Halk and Vakif 
Banks (the first two being Turkey\'s largest banks).  On the 
private side of the sector there are the big four-- Akbank 
(the market leader), Isbank, Garanti Bank and Yapi Kredi (the 
last being managed by the BRSA with a view towards its sale 
in the medium term).  There are also six significant 
medium-sized banks (by Turkey\'s standards)-- Kocbank, 
Denizbank, Finansbank and TEB are the leaders in this 
category.  In addition to small traditional banks, there are 
also a number of \"Special Finance Houses\" (in Turkish legal 
parlance) which follow Islamic banking principles.  Though 
they account for only 4 percent of total banking sector 
assets, they are politically important to the AK party, as 
several ministers (including Finance Minister Unakitan) and 
senior officials rose through their ranks.  Foreign 
participation in the sector is extremely limited.  While a 
number of foreign commercial and investment banks have 
correspondent offices in Turkey, only two commercial banks 
have entered the market recently-- HSBC through the purchase 
of the bankrupt Demir Bank and Unicredito (Italy) through a 
50/50 partnership with Koc Bank.  Analysts note that overall 
the market is thin and undercapitalized, as is evident in the 
fact that the \"big four\'s\" total assets barely equal those of 
the National Bank of Greece (at around USD 40 billion). 
 
 
3. (SBU) Improvements Since the Crisis: If challenges remain 
in the sector, all agree that the specific problems that 
contributed to the 2001 crisis have been partially addressed 
by post-crisis reforms.  BRSA Vice President Ceyla 
Pazarbasioglu, in an April 17 meeting, pointed specifically 
to the system\'s enormous short foreign exchange position 
(addressed through a debt swap, and subsequent bank attempts 
to avoid overexposure to exchange risk); high levels of group 
lending (being brought down over four years to an 
internationally accepted level-- Finansbank Chairman Husnu 
Ozyegin noted to us on April 29 that whereas his FIBA group 
was once his bank\'s number one customer, it is now only 
number 7); and the sector\'s high level of non-performing 
loans (being addressed by debt restructuring, as through the 
Istanbul approach, and other steps).  In addition, we would 
mention two big improvements: BRSA\'s intervention and 
resolution of 19 private banks, which took out the sector\'s 
worst performers; and the GOT\'s recapitalization of Halk and 
Ziraat Banks (at a cost of about USD 25 billion). 
 
 
4. (SBU) But problems remain: Those we canvassed in recent 
weeks agree, however, that the sector is not by any means out 
of the woods.  Key remaining issues include the lack of free 
capital and the sector\'s overall need for increased 
capitalization, maturity mismatches between assets and 
liabilities, overexposure to government securities and 
resultant \"systemic\" risk, and lack of other profitable 
assets.  Though a range of banks have recently trumpeted 
advantageous loan programs for members of such business 
associations as the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, TEB General 
Manager Akin Akbaygil notes that overall there is no 
significant loan demand by local clients, given prevailing 
high interest rates and transaction costs.  That lack of 
demand has led banks to shift more of their resources into 
the government bond market, an area that Akbaygil quipped is 
a little like \"hell,\" in that it is easy to get into and very 
hard to escape.  Indeed most analysts believe that 
notwithstanding the fact that ownership of bonds by 
individuals is at its highest level ever, the banks are now 
trapped in a \"pyramid scheme\" from which they cannot escape. 
The banks are clearly aware of the treadmill on which they 
find themselves: Koc Bank General Manager Kemal Kaya 
confirmed rumors that the big four have been exploring the 
possibility of a government debt restructuring with the 
government in Ankara, perhaps to be accompanied by a change 
in reserve requirements.  Kaya indicated that then Treasury 
U/S Oztrak had not responded to the proposal when he received 
it in late March. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Systemic Risk: Pressure from the banks for 
restructuring has likely eased in recent weeks, as the 
overall market mood has lightened with the end of the war. 
While banks were worried about heavy losses at the end of the 
first quarter, as a result of high interest rates, they are 
now enjoying windfall profits, given those rates decline. 
However the long-term problem of their overexposure to 
government debt remains, as does the maturity mismatch that 
accompanies it.  While most deposits held by banks are one or 
at most three month terms, government bond maturities have 
increasingly been extended, and now average just over 14 
months.  Given that most bank-held bonds have a floating rate 
or are denominated in foreign currencies, the banks no longer 
face a large foreign exchange risk (it has effectively been 
shifted to the government, which has been managing it well), 
but the overall credit risk remains, and in the view of some 
outside analysts should be provisioned against (though 
currently government bonds are treated as no risk for 
accounting purposes).  Akbaygil also alerted us to another 
looming risk that has attracted little attention to date: the 
banks\' exposure to the liabilities of the Turkish insurance 
industry, which it largely controls through wholly-owned 
subsidiaries.  Like the banks themselves the sector is 
undercapitalized. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Structural Problems: Beyond the difficult 
macroeconomic environment in which they work, banks also face 
a tough operating environment.  Akbank CEO Zafer Kurtal noted 
that in addition to high interest rates, intermediation taxes 
and fees can easily add another fifteen percent to the cost 
of a loan, even before any bank margin is considered.  Banks\' 
problems are compounded by the continued lack of inflation 
accounting (though the government has promised to introduce 
it for the sector this year), which results in situations 
like that faced by industry leader Akbank in the first three 
months of this year, when it paid an effective 80 percent tax 
rate on its profits.  The larger banks (especially Is and 
Garanti) hold large real estate portfolios and other fixed 
assets which cannot be easily liquidated in the present 
economic environment.  Isbank, given its extensive industrial 
subsidiaries, has faced extensive group losses which have 
dragged down its bottom line.  Bender Securities analyst 
Murat Gulkan notes that as a result the banks\' position is a 
bit deceiving, in that they are not as solvent as their 
current liquidity would otherwise indicate. 
 
 
7. (SBU) The Lethal Bank/Media Mix: At least three of 
Turkey\'s biggest banks are owned by groups with large media 
holdings (YPK, Disbank, and Garanti).  The media subsidiaries 
often slant \"news\" stories to promote their holding and bank 
interests.  Thus Dogan\'s (Dis\' parent) recent series on the 
BRSA\'s failure to collect from bankrupt banks\' former owners 
also coincided with Dis\' attempt to acquire assets from the 
BRSA.  Even so, there is legitimate public concern with the 
failure to date to collect from former bank owners.  The 
BRSA\'s inability to agressively pursue these debtors has been 
the one black mark on an otherwise strong record. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: As TEB CEO Akbaygil noted to us, banking is 
the superstructure of the overall economy, and consequently 
will prosper or suffer in line with the economy\'s health and 
the government\'s effectiveness in implementing the economic 
reform program.  If reform implementation continues, analysts 
see a strong upside-- a view that led one brokerage to 
upgrade both Akbank and Isbank late last year.  Improvement 
of the macroeconomic climate alone will not be enough, 
however.  In the medium term, more capital is needed.  The 
two most likely sources of this capital are direct foreign 
investment or selling off more equity on the Istanbul Stock 
Exchange.  Either choice will result in dilution of 
family-owned bank businesses.  While some CEO\'s like 
Finansbank\'s Husnu Ozyegin tell us they are prepared to 
accept this (in the expectation that they will be able to 
retain effective control even with a 25-30 percent share), 
traditional attitudes on protecting the family \"jewels\" will 
doubtless prove a barrier.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL MAYORALTY: UP FOR GRABS? 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: The Istanbul Mayoralty, often characterized 
as the second most desirable political prize in the country, 
has become the focus of a back-room power struggle as players 
jockey for ground in advance of the April 2004 local 
elections. Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna, an independent since the 
Virtue Party was banned in 2001, narrowly escaped a recent 
Justice and Development (AK) Party-orchestrated no-confidence 
vote in the normally acquiescent City Council.  Following his 
now-public fallout with AK, there is widespread speculation 
that he may join media tycoon Cem Uzan\'s Youth Party (GP), 
thereby setting the stage for a tightly contested election 
next year.  Other high-profile names are also being floated 
as trial balloons, but most key political groups are waiting 
cautiously before deciding which horse to bet on.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) For perhaps the first time ever, on March 28 the 
Istanbul City Council refused to approve the Mayor\'s annual 
report on the previous year\'s municipal activities.  118 of 
the 203 City Council members, including the Justice and 
Development (AK), Republican People\'s (CHP), and Felicity 
(SP) Party groups, voted to reject the report; 42 Motherland 
Party (ANAP) members voted in favor of approving the report. 
A two-thirds majority (i.e., another 35 nay votes) would have 
had the legal effect of a no-confidence vote.  The Governor 
would have been forced to appoint a temporary replacement and 
a formal dismissal case would have been opened against Mayor 
Ali Mufit Gurtuna.  This development is particularly 
surprising in light of the fact that the City Council is a 
largely powerless, rubber-stamp body.  While its formal 
duties do include approving the overall city budget, its 
activities have been generally limited to approval of the 
annual activity report and other ceremonial functions.  The 
City Council includes municipal officials from Istanbul\'s 
various districts, as well as part-time politicians who seek 
the office primarily for influence to help advance their 
private business careers. 
 
 
3. (C) So what did Mayor Gurtuna do to antagonize the City 
Council?  Veteran AK Group President Huseyin Evliyaoglu 
complained to poloff that the 2002 Municipal Report had not 
been \"serious\":  first, it failed to focus on last year\'s 
activities, simply recycling language and photographs from 
previous editions; second, it arbitrarily put forth 550 new 
spending projects (that deal less with the city\'s needs and 
more with the fact that their total number corresponds to the 
550th anniversary of the Ottoman conquest of Istanbul).  In 
short, it was a mere \"public relations document.\"  Evliyaoglu 
did not deny, however, that the report was typical of 
previous reports.  Pressed for more substantive criticisms, 
Evliyaoglu openly suggested (while refraining from offering 
details) that the real opposition to Gurtuna stemmed from 
concerns about corruption and malfeasance.  Evliyaoglu also 
complained that the major media groups have all been \"bought 
off\" by the Mayor, claiming that in one incident Gurtuna 
capitulated to demands from Star newspaper representatives 
for contracts and concessions when he was threatened with an 
incriminating file with both evidence and allegations. 
 
 
4. (C) ANAP Group President Recai Delibasioglu, whose party 
\"saved\" Gurtuna by voting in favor of the report, told poloff 
that the report was merely a pretext for an AK-orchestrated 
effort to unseat, or at least discredit, the Mayor. 
According to Delibasioglu, AK resents the fact that Gurtuna, 
who came to power as Erdogan\'s deputy with the then-Virtue 
Party, has maintained his distance from the party\'s more 
successful successor.  The rift between them has now grown to 
the point where all bridges have been burnt.  ANAP, 
meanwhile, faces a disintegrating voter base and a bleak 
political future.  But with 6 Istanbul district mayors 
dependent on good ties with the city mayor\'s office, ANAP 
remains on good terms with Gurtuna.  The fact that 
Delibasioglu also indicated that he expects to play an 
important role in the upcoming and potentially lucrative 
privatization of the Istanbul Natural Gas Distribution 
Corporation suggests that there may have been some quid pro 
quo in return for ANAP\'s support. 
 
 
5. (C) Evliyaoglu told poloff that relations between AKP and 
Gurtuna have reached new lows and that he sees Gurtuna\'s 
chances of being the AK candidate for mayor in next year\'s 
local elections as \"one in a hundred\" (i.e., as close to zero 
as you can get in Turkey\'s unpredictable politics). 
Evliyaoglu was particularly incensed that he had heard that 
Gurtuna hoped to use his recent trip to Washington for the 
American-Turkish Council Meeting to convince U.S. officials 
that he remains a likely AKP candidate and to secure their 
support in convincing PM Erdogan to offer him the nomination. 
 Evliyaoglu declined to join the delegation for the trip 
precisely because he was worried that his presence might 
convey the impression that Gurtuna was maintaining good ties 
with AKP.  On the other hand, Muge Altas, Advisor to the 
Mayor, argued to poloff that the rift between Gurtuna and AK 
is not nearly as wide as others believe.  She also 
downplayed, but did not deny, the rumors that Gurtuna might 
be considering the Youth Party. 
 
 
6. (C) Other high-profile names have also been floated as 
possible contenders for the Istanbul Mayoralty in next year\'s 
elections. Delibasioglu claimed that former Interior Minister 
and ANAP parliamentarian Sadettin Tantan might be convinced 
to throw his hat in the ring.  Tantan, formerly the Mayor of 
Istanbul\'s Fatih district, is well-known and well-liked in 
Istanbul.  In a chance meeting with poloff, however, Tantan 
refused to confirm rumors about his potential candidacy.  CHP 
parliamentarian and former Economy Minister Kemal Dervis is 
another name that we have heard mentioned as a possible 
contender, although most dismiss this as unlikely. 
7. (C) Comment:  While the opposition of the toothless City 
Council is clearly not one of Gurtuna\'s major worries, it is 
an indication of the Mayor\'s political isolation.  The roots 
of Gurtuna\'s problems with the City Council largely stem from 
his refusal to politically align himself with one of the 
major parties.  It is clear that relations between Gurtuna 
and the Istanbul-based AK Party have been seriously strained, 
but AK and Gurtuna continue to represent each other\'s best 
chance to win in the upcoming local elections.  If AK\'s 
popularity deteriorates significantly before next year\'s 
elections, we do not rule out the possibility of a 
last-minute reconciliation, or at least \"alliance of 
convenience,\" between Gurtuna and AK Party Chairman Tayyip 
Erdogan.  Contenders from other parties, even names like 
Tantan and Dervis, would be long-shots unless they emerge as 
consensus candidates after a fundamental realignment of the 
center-right or center-left parties.

SUBJECT: THE \"ARMENIAN ISSUE\" IN ISTANBUL 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Most of those Turks we have spoken with in 
Istanbul are largely ignorant of the tragic fate of at least 
hundreds of thousands of Armenians who were killed in 1894-5 
and especially in 1915-16 throughout Anatolia toward the end 
of the Ottoman Empire.  Turkish history books and readily 
available academic literature fail to address the subject, 
leaving Turks without an objective context to evaluate the 
claims leveled by the Armenian Diaspora.  As a result, such 
charges and the consequent international demands for Turkey 
to \"recognize\" the 1915 deaths as a \"genocide\" are merely 
dismissed by Istanbul Turks as part of a hostile propaganda 
campaign and a prelude to demands for \"compensation.\"   A 
\"Genocide Resolution\" from the U.S. Congress would be greeted 
with public outrage and would strengthen anti-Americanism. 
End Summary. 
 
 
How does the average Istanbul Turk see the Armenian issue? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
2. (U) We have spoken to a number of Istanbul Turks over the 
last several weeks in an effort to get a better sense of the 
range of opinion on this issue.  The subject appears to have 
been largely ignored in the Turkish history books and most 
have only a very dim understanding of what happened to the 
Armenians in 1915-16.  To the extent that Turks here have a 
historical understanding of the events, it is in the context 
of the invasions and uprisings that threatened the Ottoman 
Empire.  For most, however, the issue has come to their 
attention only as the result of what they see as a hostile 
propaganda campaign by the Armenian Diaspora -- the same 
Diaspora that earlier spawned a terrorist organization that 
assassinated 34 Turkish diplomats in the 1970s and 1980s, 
including several in the United States.  Predictably, for a 
population that is still mainly inward-looking and 
reflexively nationalistic, each new development in this 
international campaign provokes howls of protest here in 
Istanbul. 
 
 
Is the so-called Armenian \"genocide\" still taboo? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
3. (C) In the past, Turkish authorities actively restricted 
what could be written or said on this and other subjects, but 
in recent years such restrictions have eased.  As an example, 
Hrant Dink, the editor of Turkey\'s only Armenian-language 
newspaper, Agos, told poloff that in the last few years three 
separate books that dealt with the subject were banned after 
publication.  One of the publishers spent six months in 
prison as a result.  But when the cases were taken to court, 
all of the charges were dismissed and the bans were lifted. 
Dink speculated that Turkish authorities have realized that 
these cases merely generate undesirable publicity while 
simply ignoring these publications consigns them to the dusty 
back shelves of bookstores and libraries. 
 
 
How would Turks in Istanbul react to a \"Genocide\" resolution? 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
 
4. (C) The almost universal response from average Turks here 
would be outrage and would be reflected strongly in the mass 
media.  Beyond that, however, both Hrant Dink and Ilter 
Turkmen (former Foreign Minister and Turkish Coordinator of 
the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission) asked, \"what 
more could Turkey do?\"  A few even suggested that it might be 
better to go ahead and get it out of the way, rather than 
endure the annual suspenseful ritual of waiting to see 
whether the Congress will pass it or not.  Most, however, 
worry that such a development would aggravate a continuing 
anti-American, anti-Western current of public opinion and 
would have negative long-term repercussions.  Similarly, each 
year Istanbul Turks nervously await the U.S. President\'s 
April 24 statement, judging it largely by the simple measure 
of whether or not it uses the \"g-word.\" 
 
 
What are the prospects for reconciliation with Armenia? 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
5. (C) This is obviously an issue that rests in the hands of 
the government in Ankara.  Those we have spoken to here are 
not hopeful that there will be much progress.  Turkmen 
expressed his frustration, saying that he had pushed Ankara, 
unsuccessfully, to unilaterally open the border with Armenia. 
 Turkmen blamed those in the mid-to-senior ranks of the 
Foreign Ministry, arguing that they have a narrow, 
nationalistic mindset that makes it impossible for them to 
see the way forward on this issue.  Turkmen told poloff that 
the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission had achieved 
only very limited progress and would need to be changed 
before it could continue its work.  Dink, too, expressed 
frustration with the government for not opening the border 
(\"Even the border between northern and southern Cyprus has 
been opened...\").  Conceding that the Justice and Development 
(AK) Party government has had a lot on its plate (i.e., EU 
accession, Cyprus, Iraq) since coming to power last November, 
Dink held out little hope that they would be able to do much 
with Armenia.

SUBJECT: WOLFOWITZ AND PERLE REMARKS REVIVE DEBATE ON 
U.S.-TURKEY TIES 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Recent remarks by DOD Deputy Secretary 
Wolfowitz and Defense Policy Board Member Perle have revived 
a rancorous public debate in Istanbul on the status of 
U.S.-Turkish relations.  Reactions to the May 6 Wolfowitz 
interview on CNN Turk also dominated our previously-scheduled 
May 7 meetings with a range of local contacts.  In 
characteristic Turkish fashion, a pro-U.S. NGO leader, a 
retired Admiral, and a local district mayor bristled 
self-defensively upon hearing criticism from a foreign 
quarter.  After some discussion and reflection, however, our 
contacts generally accepted the criticism (while maintaining 
that the USG had made mistakes of its own) and focused on the 
need to rebuild the damaged bilateral relationship.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) The following comments provide a sample of the local 
reaction to DOD Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz\'s remarks 
during a May 6 CNN Turk interview: 
 
 
- Retired 3-star Admiral Attila Kayat remarked that it was 
hypocritical and inappropriate for Wolfowitz to claim that 
the Turkish military should have taken a stronger (and hence 
\"undemocratic\") stand in the lead-up to the Turkish 
parliament vote on whether to allow U.S. troops to enter 
Turkey; 
- ARI Movement President Kemal Koprulu characterized the 
remarks as \"blunt,\" and while admitting that Turkey had made 
mistakes before the vote, argued that the USG had made 
mistakes as well; 
- Nonplused, Beykoz District Mayor Alaattin Koseler (from 
former PM Ecevit\'s Democratic Left Party) asked how deeply 
felt Wolfowitz\'s opinions were within the USG in general. 
Though accepting of poloff\'s explanation that the remarks did 
not run contrary to the idea that Turkey and the U.S. 
remained close allies, Koseler voiced concern that Turkish 
public opinion would react badly regardless of the intended 
meaning. 
 
 
3. (C) After some discussion and reflection, however, both 
Kayat and Koprulu readily admitted that Turkey had made 
mistakes and that Wolfowitz had correctly focused on the need 
to rebuild the bilateral relationship.  Kayat was reluctant 
to hold his former military colleagues responsible, arguing 
instead that the Justice and Development (AK) Party 
government should have simply said \"no\" to the USG from the 
beginning, instead of making promises and engaging in 
negotiations over an assistance package.  Koprulu readily 
accepted that the GOT, the opposition Republican People\'s 
Party (CHP), the bureaucracy, and the military all made 
mistakes.  Both Koprulu and Kayat argued, however, that the 
USG\'s failure to \"sell\" its case for war to Turkey was a key 
element in the fateful parliamentary decision. 
 
 
4. (U) Defense Board member Richard Perle repeated some of 
Wolfowitz\'s points at a May 8 conference, and went on to 
openly criticize the inexperience of the new Turkish 
government and irresponsibility of the opposition CHP.  The 
questions following Perle\'s remarks on \"whether Turkey would 
be forced to pay a price for not supporting the U.S.\" and 
\"what Turkey would need to do to repair the relationship\" 
reflect general concerns in Istanbul on the issue.  Perle 
responded that the U.S. has no plans for a retaliatory policy 
and called for both sides to rediscover mutual interests, 
undertake joint projects, and rebuild the damaged bilateral 
relationship.  By criticizing the regimes in Syria and Iraq 
as \"undemocratic\" and \"supportive of terrorists\" and 
expressing hope for rapid regime change in both, Perle 
implicitly warned against a Turkish policy which would ignore 
core U.S. interests and implied that this should be an area 
where Turkey and the U.S. work together. 
 
 
5. (C) Comment: The remarks by Wolfowitz and Perle have 
revived the underlying unease among our contacts in Istanbul 
regarding the strained U.S.-Turkish relationship. 
Ever-sensitive to foreign criticism, initial reactions were 
self-defensive, but if our contacts are any indication, 
further reflection may lead many here to look for productive 
ways to begin rebuilding the partnership.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL IN THE SPRINGTIME: RESURGENT OPTIMISM 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: As a belated spring bursts forth on the 
Bosphorus following an unusually cold and protracted winter, 
\"spring is also in the air\" in Istanbul business circles. 
The resurgent optimism stems from speedy conclusion to the 
war in Iraq and belief that its short-term cost for Turkey 
was limited, and will easily be surpassed by the long-term 
benefits access to the Iraqi market can provide.  With 
declining interest rates, a strengthening lira, and improving 
inflation performance, Istanbul business leaders believe that 
four-five percent GDP growth is no longer out of the 
question.  Some tourism industry leaders now indicate that in 
place of the 50-60 percent dropoff they earlier predicted, 
Turkey\'s tourism loss can be held to 15 percent, leaving the 
country ahead of last year\'s levels.  With strong export 
growth, the key issue remains domestic demand, which has 
rebounded in some sectors, but not across the board. 
Istanbul\'s business elite expects the turn around to deepen 
in the second half of 2003, however, as the uncertainty 
caused by the war recedes.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Gloom Recedes: In place of the extreme pessimism 
that characterized the run-up to the Iraq war and 
accompanying concern about U.S.-Turkish relations and the 
depth of the government\'s commitment to the IMF program, 
optimism is now in the air in Istanbul.  Whereas analysts two 
months ago saw no engine for growth in the economy other than 
exports, and saw serious impacts from the war on domestic 
demand, tourism, and public investment, there is now 
widespread expectation that only the latter will act as a 
brake on growth.  The improvement in sentiment is evident in 
the latest Central Bank Survey, which reports improving 
expectations on growth (up to 3.7 percent), inflation (down 
to 26.6 percent) and interest rates. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Tourism: While tourism leaders we canvassed in March 
gloomily predicted a 50-60 percent drop to 5.5 billion as a 
result of the war, they are now relatively more sanguine. 
The sector did experience a 25 percent drop in March, 
following a 15 percent gain in the first two months of the 
year, but some industry leaders believe recovery to near 2002 
levels is not out of the question.  Turkish Tourist Agency 
Union (TURSAB) head Basaran Ulusoy told us on May 7 that he 
believes the loss can be held to 10-15 percent from the 
year-end target of 15 million tourists, leaving Turkey ahead 
of last year\'s level.  Tourism Investors\' Association 
Secretary General Nedret Koruyan is more circumspect, 
 
SIPDIS 
suggesting that while tourist numbers may recover to last 
year\'s level, overall revenues will decline, as foreign 
travel agencies are agressively pressing for discounts for 
last minute bookings.  She noted, though, that the decline 
will not approach the magnitudes the industry earlier feared. 
 
 
 
 
4.  (SBU) Exports:  One of the driving forces behind last 
year\'s growth seems only to have picked up pace in the first 
four months of 2003, with an impressive 36 percent increase 
in exports.  Total volume is close to USD 14 billion, and 
analysts predict that exports will reach USD 40 billion for 
the year, exceeding even the ambitious year-end target of 39 
billion.  Analysts see the possibility of an annual export 
volume of up to USD 6 billion with Iraq, once trade is 
normalized, arguing that Turkey is ideally positioned to 
supply that country\'s consumer needs.  Meanwhile, in the last 
quarter, the leading export items readywear and automotive 
products recorded 28 and 66 percent increases respectively. 
Suleyman Orakcioglu, head of the Istanbul Readywear 
Exporters\' Union and creator of the successful \"Damat\" brand, 
told us on May 6 that Turkish exporters gained valuable 
experience after the 2001 crisis when domestic demand 
plummeted and companies were forced to exploit international 
markets.  Aggressive marketing is supported by the benefit 
provided by the strong Euro in European markets, which 
account for more than 50 percent of Turkey\'s exports. 
Orakcioglu predicted that Turkish textile makers will also 
benefit from the SARS epidemic in Asia, noting that they are 
already seeing new orders from companies that are not 
interested in travelling to the Far East.  He expressed 
concern, however, that existing quota limits will prevent 
Turkey from filling the expected additional demand from U.S. 
customers. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Domestic Demand: The wild card in the deck remains 
the ability of domestic demand to rebound and take the place 
of stock accumulation, which accounted for the bulk of GDP 
growth last year.  Initial indications are promising. 
Industrial production grew 7.5 percent in the first quarter 
on y-o-y terms, including a surprisingly strong 5.6 percent 
in March, far exceeding analysts\' expectations of 1.3 
percent.  Earlier predictions of 0-2 percent growth for 2003 
have been revised to 4-5 percent by some analysts (in line 
with the Central Bank survey\'s 3.7 percent).  Selected 
retailers report up to a 30 percent increase in sales during 
the past few weeks, and expect demand to increase further as 
the uncertainty caused by the war recedes.  Domestic sales of 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles also rose 271 
percent in the first quarter (from an admittedly weak 2002 
figure-- the lowest in the last decade), while consumer 
durables recorded a 20 percent increase.  These trends are 
expected to continue as improving inflation performance and 
declining interest rates spur the release of pent-up demand. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: The mood on the Bosphorus is definitely 
more hopeful than it was six weeks ago, but significant risk 
factors remain.  Chief among them are continued government 
implementation of the reform program and the strengthening 
lira, which could begin to hurt Turkey\'s international 
competitiveness.  Contrarians also note that while Turkish 
markets always expect an easy summer, something usually 
happens to change the picture-- from the Russia crisis in 
1998 to early elections in 2002.  While no such event is on 
the horizon, any such external or internal shock could easily 
change the current picture, given the economy\'s underlying 
fragility.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: MINORITY RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN TURKEY: A 
QUESTION OF APPROACH ON PROPERTY ISSUES 
 
REF: (A) ISTANBUL 202 (B) 2002 ISTANBUL 1627 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David L. Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and ( 
 
 
d). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Recent legal changes in property rights for 
minority foundations have elicited varied responses from 
different religious communities in Turkey.  The history of 
Turkish and Ottoman minority communities plays into their 
respective views on pastoral concerns, political connections, 
property issues, and outside audiences.  Each community\'s 
pragmatic calculation of its own best interest accounts for 
differences in minority community relations with the Turkish 
Government.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
The Unbending Greek Position 
---------------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) The Ecumenical Patriarch has the difficult task of 
occupying the universally acknowledged, but often 
disregarded, Patriarchal throne of Constantinople and New 
Rome, recognized as ecumenical outside Turkey, but deprecated 
by the Turkish state.  First among the Patriarchs of all 
Orthodoxy, his pastoral duties include ministering to 
millions of diaspora Greeks in the United States (as well as 
other countries), and a tiny group (around 3,000) of aging 
Greeks in Istanbul.  His flock, which at the turn of the 
twentieth century numbered over 500,000 in Istanbul alone 
(and millions throughout Turkey), once owned vast areas in 
and around Istanbul, including all of Heybeliada, the island 
which still houses Halki Seminary, currently not permitted to 
function by the Turkish State. 
 
 
3. (C) Given the small size of the Greek Orthodox community 
in Turkey, the Ecumenical Patriarch is not heavily encumbered 
with local pastoral obligations.  American Greeks, from whom 
he derives much respect, outside support, and funding, 
encourage him to remain firm in his insistence on (1) 
recognition from the Turkish State of his ecumenical status; 
and (2) reopening Halki Seminary.  In a recent submission of 
lost property to the General Directorate for Foundations, 
Metropolitan Meliton said the Patriarchate submitted claims 
for 1,374 disputed properties (other sources say they 
submitted close to 2,000).  In contrast, Armenians submitted 
less than 400, Jews four, and Chaldeans three. 
 
 
4. (U) NOTE: Radikal newspaper reported May 5 that 1593 
applications have been submitted to the General Directorate 
for Foundations so far.  Of those, 574 (or 36 percent) of the 
applications were rejected.  Of those property claims 
rejected, 302 were Greek, 232 Armenian (the article does not 
differentiate between Armenian Catholic and Orthodox claims), 
and 13 Jewish.  END NOTE. 
 
 
5. (C) Additionally, the Ecumenical Patriachate is 
considerably less concerned with angering the GoT by voicing 
objections to outsiders than the Jews or Armenians.  After 
the First World War, Greeks transferred some community 
properties into the names of private individuals in order to 
avoid expropriation.  The door, however, was closed behind 
them.  Until the most recent spate of legal reforms, a 
religious community could not make use of these 
nominally-private properties.  In one case, an orphanage was 
tranferred into private hands but could not be further used 
by the community.  Additionally, Turkish law forbade the 
religious minority communities from gaining property through 
inheritance, except under special circumstances as determined 
by the General Directorate for Foundations.  To the knowledge 
of ConGen Istanbul, no community has ever received permission 
to gain property by inheritance. 
 
 
6. (C) With these memories still haunting the Patriarch and 
his supporters, post believes an unwritten decision was taken 
not to pursue any legal loopholes in the future.  Rather, the 
Patriarchate has consistently pressed for explicit legal 
recognition of their various property claims (reftel).  To 
date, this has not borne fruit.  However, with a 
steadily-shrinking local community and a supportive overseas 
flock, the Ecumenical Patriarch has considerably less to lose 
than other religious minorities in confronting the GoT. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Flexible Jewish Policies 
------------------------ 
 
 
7. (C) The Jewish community in Turkey numbers approximately 
25,000 people, the vast majority of whom are in Istanbul. 
The community maintains property primarily on the European 
side of the city, with a synagogue and other properties also 
on Buyukada (an island in the Sea of Marmara).  Despite the 
community\'s size, few legal problems exist, largely due to 
the flexible approach the community has taken in maintaining 
its properties. 
 
 
8. (C) First, the community tranfers ownership when necessary 
to avoid expropriation or other loss.  While the Chief 
Rabbinate has had a historically close relationship with U.S. 
and Israeli diplomats, it avoids adversarial relations with 
the Turkish Government.  The community avoids formalisti=QQdealing with 
he General Directorate for Foundations (which 
all communities assess is not favorably disposed to Jewish or 
Christian needs to begin with), opting instead to approach 
elected officials who can bring pressure on the General 
Directorate\'s bureaucrats from above.  Poloff pointed out to 
Chief Rabbinate\'s Lay Vice President Lina Filiba that the 
community has a history of finding a modus vivendi within 
Turkish law (\"and sometimes outside it,\" she said) to achieve 
their goals, while other communities were less flexible. 
Filiba said that meeting the spiritual needs of their 
community come first, and the means by which this is 
accomplished are less important. 
 
 
9. (C) Unlike the Greeks, the Jewish Community has a younger 
generation as well as a series of wealthy entrepreneurs who 
can assist when financial problems come up.  Jak Kamhi 
(Chairman of Profilo Holding), the Garih and Alaton families 
(founders of Alarko Holding), and others can be depended upon 
to assist when necessary.  Thus, fighting tooth-and-nail for 
one or two small properties that can bring little monetary 
compensation at a significant political cost is not their 
normal practice. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
Tending the Armenian Flock 
-------------------------- 
 
 
10. (C) Patriarch Mesrob II finds himself in a delicate 
position: as head of the Armenian Orthodox community in 
Turkey, he must tend to the needs of his sizeable community 
(estimated at 65,000 to 70,000 people, now the largest of the 
Lausanne Treaty minorities) by working with the Turkish 
Government on practical matters such as minority education 
policy, church maintenance, and reconstruction of the 
patriarchate building.  At the same time, his working 
relationship with the GoT often comes under criticism from 
the Armenian Orthodox Church and the sizeable Armenian 
diaspora in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere.  Reflecting on 
the question of whether the tragic events that befell 
Armenians in the closing days of the Ottoman Empire should be 
called a \"genocide\" or not, Mesrob has said that the more 
important work is to focus community energy on healing, 
building bridges between Turks and Armenians, and moving 
forward. 
 
 
11. (C) Mesrob has elected to work publicly with the 
Government of Turkey.  He was the only Patriarch to travel to 
Copenhagen to voice support for Turkey\'s EU aspirations in 
the run-up to the most recent accessions.  Publicly voicing 
pride in his Turkish citizenship, Mesrob has sought to 
consolidate the position of his community by adopting a 
non-threatening approach.  Recently, when asked by poloff 
what concerns he had about property issues, Mesrob said that 
while there were some continuing concerns, the Armenian 
Orthodox community had no intention of airing the problems 
publicly, or relying on outside assistance.  However, the 
Patriarch and others have leveled complaints about property 
issues and complications in working with the General 
Directorate for Foundations; these complaints are similar to 
those of other communities. 
 
 
12. (C) Criticism of GoT policies is balanced with pragmatic 
interest in cooperation to improve Armenian community 
cohesion.  For example, in a recent discussion with poloff, 
Armenian Patriarchal Chancellor Tatul said the community 
remains interested in recent mother-tongue language laws, and 
is considering an Armenian-language radio station (if 
forthcoming regulations permit) in addition to their 
community newspaper, \"Lraper.\" 
 
 
---------------------- 
Unrecognized Suriyanis 
---------------------- 
 
 
13. (C) Like other sizeable minority communities in Turkey, 
the Syrian Orthodox were offered Lausanne Treaty status as 
minorities.  Reflecting a spirit of patriotism toward the 
fledgling Turkish Republic, the Patriarch (then seated in 
Antakya, biblical Antioch) said that Suriyanis were Turkish 
citizens, and had no need of minority status, as the 
constitution would ensure their rights to freedom of 
religion.  Though both the Suriyanis and the GoT may have 
meant well, this left the community in limbo: not protected 
by Lausanne, not Muslim, and not foreign nationals.  As such, 
there is effectively no protection for the Syrian Orthodox 
Church. 
 
 
14. (C) In the years since Lausanne, much Suriyani church 
property was expropriated by the GoT.  The Tur Abdin area of 
Southeast Turkey, once home to a huge Suriyani community that 
emigrated starting in the 1960\'s owing to hostility on the 
part of Turkish officials, now has a series of abandoned 
monasteries and churches where property ownership is in 
question; perhaps only 400 Suriyanis remain in Tur Abdin. 
The Patriarch eventually left Turkey for Damascus, leaving 
behind two Metropolitans (effectively Archbishops), in 
Istanbul and Midyat, to serve the still-sizeable community. 
Both Metropolitans show great appreciation for any attention 
paid to their community and its plight.  Seeing the problems 
that resulted from an effective non-status for many years, 
they quickly recount the past occasions on which foreign 
dignitaries and Turkish officials paid them a visit, or even 
sent letters of congratulations on religious holidays.  In 
Istanbul, Metropolitan Yusuf Cetin speaks with admiration for 
President Sezer\'s willingness to visit their church two years 
ago (the only President of Turkey to do so). 
 
 
15. (C) Regarding property issues, the Suriyanis claim that 
much of what has happened in the past is now beyond the scope 
of the current law.  Key monsteries and churches remain in 
their possession, yet abandoned or expropriated ones have no 
congregants.  Migrations to Syria, Europe and the U.S., and 
Istanbul have emptied much of their population from the 
Southeast.  Midyat Metropolitan Samuel Aktas says that core 
concerns of the community are largely met--worship, Aramaic 
classes, and continued functioning of monasteries.  However, 
when the Suriyanis need to deal with the GoT, they are 
usually given unwritten approval for requests.  Such tacit 
(versus official) acceptance reflects the Suriyanis\' 
still-unclear status under Turkish law.

SUBJECT: CEM UZAN STUMPS YOUTH IN ISTANBUL 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Genc Party leader Cem Uzan\'s recent speech 
to a gathering of university student leaders in Istanbul 
provided insight into both his political skills and 
shortcomings as he seeks to build on his surprisingly strong 
showing in last year\'s election.  While charismatic in some 
ways, Uzan failed significantly to address key student 
concerns about employment and education reform in the Q and A 
session.  Uzan also seems to have changed targets of 
criticism, saying nothing about the United States and taking 
only a brief swipe at the IMF.  Instead, Uzan railed at 
length against the European Customs Union (though not the EU, 
interestingly).  If Uzan is to burnish his up-and-coming 
image and appear to voters as a serious candidate, he will 
have to understand the feelings of Turkish voters on more 
issues than just the pain of international integration.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------ 
Heeeeeere\'s Cemmy! 
------------------ 
 
 
2. (U) A youthful politician bounds onto stage.  The applause 
of the 1,400-person crowd rise to a near roar as he takes off 
his blazer, and puts on the youth conference\'s t-shirt.  Live 
Star TV (owned by Uzan) cameras zoom in on the podium, while 
a boom camera pans through the crowd.  As a media 
opportunity, Cem Uzan\'s recent speech at a \"GencNet\" 
conference at Istanbul\'s Yeditepe University began very well. 
 
 
3. (U) GencNet, a web site devoted to civic action by youth, 
is supported by both the International Republican Institute 
(IRI) and the ARI Movement, a local NGO which works to 
develop civil society in Turkey.  GencNet\'s basic message to 
Turkish youth is \"get involved,\" and this year\'s conference 
allowed youth to vote on who they wanted for the keynote 
speaker.  Answer: Cem Uzan, leader of Genc (Youth) Party. 
 
 
---------------------- 
Proud Entry for Turkey 
---------------------- 
 
 
4. (U) Uzan\'s speech touched on all the major \"hot topics\" of 
Turkish politics: war in Iraq, economic crisis, relations 
with the EU and the US, and the Cyprus question. 
Interestingly, though Uzan made passing reference to his 
dislike for Turkey\'s \"subservience\" to IMF demands, he 
refrained from further comment.  Instead, he blamed a host of 
Turkish economic woes  (including joblessness, and drops in 
agricultural and industrial exports) on the European Customs 
Union, of which Turkey is a member. 
 
 
5. (U) Stating he believed Turkey to have lost USD 70 billion 
in customs revenues in the last seven years as a result of 
the customs union membership, Uzan said that the EU was 
charging Turkey \"the price for EU membership\" without 
providing \"the product\" (i.e. full membership).  In a further 
political contortion, Uzan claimed to be pro-EU, but said 
that Turkey must enter the European Union \"proudly, not 
begging to be accepted.\"  However, he said he believed that 
in the future, the EU would be a superpower, and if Turkey 
were to join, it would be \"part of that superpower.\" 
 
 
6. (U) Twice in the course of the Q and A session, Uzan 
visibly failed to address the questions posed to him 
(questions for Uzan were submitted to the GencNet web site 
and did not seem to have been given in advance to Uzan).  In 
both cases, the concerns were specific to Turkish university 
students, and resulted effectively in meandering non-answers 
from Uzan.  In response to a roundly-applauded question on 
what he would do as a future Prime Minister to encourage 
post-university job prospects, especially in light of his 
pledge to quadruple the number of Turkish universities, and 
(as the questioner pointed out) the difficulty graduates 
already face in the job market, Uzan blamed customs union 
membership as the cause of lost jobs.  He added that his 
focus is on raising the number of universities; the question 
of employment is unrelated.  His answer was not applauded. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
I said \"no,\" but AK should have said \"yes\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
7. (U) When asked about his position on the war in Iraq, Uzan 
made reference to several full-page adds he took out in his 
family\'s newspapers and elsewhere.  \"As you all know, I was 
against this war in Iraq, remembering the losses Turkey 
suffered in the first Gulf War.  However, the AK government 
was inexperienced, and started bargaining, rather than 
looking after Turkey\'s strategic interests.  If the motion 
(to allow the US bases and transit through Turkey) had been 
approved, Turkey would have gotten a seat at the table to 
decide the future of Iraq.  The problem is not US-Turkish 
relations, but Turkey\'s bargaining approach to the issue.\" 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
8. (SBU) Uzan benefited from slick public relations advice, 
lumpenproletariat glee at his ability to swindle Motorola out 
of USD 2 billion, and his widespread ownership of television 
and press outlets in the Fall 2002 general election campaign, 
and again in his early-2003 anti-US/anti-war media campaign. 
However, his performance at the GencNet Conference suggests a 
lack of knowledge on a variety of significant issues, 
including higher education, employment, national security, 
and Cyprus.  Additionally, Uzan\'s schizophrenic positions on 
the EU and war in Iraq serve to muddle his message.  The 
run-up to November\'s election was a sprint for Uzan.  Any 
future aspirations for parliament will be more of a political 
\"marathon,\" and require a broader and more persuasive message 
than he has heretofore displayed.  We will continue to press 
Genc Party contacts as well on Uzan\'s defrauding of Motorola.

SUBJECT: LEADERSHIP IN THE ORTHODOX WORLD: THE ECUMENICAL 
PATRIARCH AND RUSSIAN COMPETITION 
 
Classified By: Consul General David L. Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) 
and ( d). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Though divided among many national churches, 
all Orthodox leaders except the Russian Orthodox recognize 
the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul, Bartholomew II, as 
first among equals.  Located in \"The Second Rome,\" the 
Ecumenical Patriarch traces a line of succession back to St. 
Andrew and, later, the conversion of Emperor Constantine. 
However, Alexei II, Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, 
may be making a play for preeminence within Orthodoxy.  In a 
recent conversation, Metropolitan Meliton confirmed the 
competitive atmosphere and the Ecumenical Patriarchate\'s 
animosity toward more recent Russian machinations.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------------- 
How Many Romes Are There? 
------------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) Being a student of Orthodox power politics is a little 
bit like watching a prize fight in slow-motion.  Jabs and 
swings come only rarely, and there are plenty of breaks.  The 
prize in question in this case is not a summit of religious 
authority, as with the Pope in Roman Catholicism, but a nod 
of pre-eminence from other Orthodox leaders.  With this nod 
comes a certain ability to set the tone of discussions 
between Orthodoxy and the outside world, especially Western 
Christianity.  However, changes come only slowly, and church 
concerns revolve around events in the distant future. 
 
 
3. (C) One of the central pillars of support to the 
Ecumenical Patriarch\'s claim to ecumenical status is 
location.  As \"Patriarch of Constantinople and New Rome,\" he 
can trace authority back to the Apostle Andrew and leadership 
of the city where Christianity first became legalized within 
the Roman Empire under Constantine, and later the state 
religion.  Demography and Turkish law are working against the 
Ecumenical Patriarch\'s status in \"The Second Rome,\" however. 
The Greek Orthodox citizens of Turkey (from whom a new 
Patriarch must be chosen) now number only 3,000.  For the 
Patriarchate to continue beyond one or two more patriarchs 
after Bartholomew II, Turkish law regarding Lausanne Treaty 
minorities will have to change, allowing leadership by 
non-Turkish citizens.  This seems unlikely to happen. 
 
 
4. (C) There is a Third Rome, though.  Moscow claims that, 
prior to the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, the torch was 
passed to it to take up leadership within Orthodoxy, when the 
tsar was given the Cap of Monomakh.  Tenuous though the claim 
 
SIPDIS 
may be, it allowed the Romanov tsars to claim the title of 
\"Protector of the Orthodox Faith,\" a position which played 
into Russia\'s involvement in the First World War, and the 
Romanov dynasty\'s demise. 
 
 
------------------------- 
Don\'t Write to My Bishop! 
------------------------- 
 
 
5. (C) The most recent round of maneuvering began with a 
letter from Russian Patriarch Alexei II to several Orthodox 
leaders in Western Europe.  Under Orthodox canon law, a 
Patriarchof a national church is confined to communicating 
directly on 
 with bishops and priests under his on 
authority.  The Ecumenical Patriarchate provided poloff with 
a letter from Alexei to, among others, \"His Grace, the Right 
Reverend Gabriel, Bishop of Komansk, Locum Tenens of the 
Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox Parishes in Western Europe,\" 
and four other church leaders the Ecumenical Patriarch claims 
as his own. 
 
 
6. (C) In the letter, Alexei lays out the reasons that he 
does not consider the Russian Orthodox Church in Western 
Europe to be subordinate to Constantinople.  He cites a 1931 
letter from Photius, then Ecumenical Patriarch, who he argues 
foresaw only temporary subordination of the Russian Exarchate 
in Western Europe to Constantinople \"until, God willing, 
unity and the unbroken image of the Holy Sister Russian 
Church are restored.\"  Alexei now argues that that time has 
come. 
7. (C) Moreover, Alexei\'s letter lays out a new proposal for 
a single Metropolitan for the Russian Church in Western 
Europe.  Unlike the current Orthodox leaders in Western 
Europe, who are appointed by the Ecumenical Patriarch, he 
argues that local leaders should be elected from among local 
clergy, and confirmed by Moscow.  Thus, Alexei holds out the 
prospect of greater autonomy, tied to his own authority. 
 
 
--------------------- 
More Churches, Please 
--------------------- 
 
 
8. (C) On a recent trip to Moscow, Metropolitan Meliton of 
Philadelphia (Chief Secretary of the Holy Synod) said the 
Russians made a further request: four churches in Istanbul. 
Currently, the Russian Orthodox Church provides priests to 
serve in a church owned by the Ecumenical Patriarchate. 
However, they argue, their need has grown, and more churches 
are required.  Rather than just working as guests on 
Ecumenical Patriarchate property, they have requested that 
ownership be transferred to them.  Meliton said he denied 
their request, but offered to expand the number of Russian 
Orthodox priests allowed to serve the flock in Istanbul. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
\"Political, Not Spiritual\" 
-------------------------- 
 
 
9. (C) Meliton said that in the wake of the collapse of 
communism, the Russian Orthodox Church was badly discredited, 
not least among their Orthodox co-religionists.  While he 
recalls in the past working with Russian prelates who were 
focused on spiritual concerns, he feels that picture has 
changed.  Now, he says, \"Alexei and his bishops are all 
former KGB informants, who still work closely with the FSB 
and are far more political than spiritual in nature.\" 
Meliton says he and the Patriarchate view Russian Orthodoxy 
with great suspicion, and believe that it is deeply entangled 
in the political needs of the Russian state. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
10. (C) Although not unheard of, it is rare for Turkish 
political analysts or commentators to grasp that GOT 
acceptance of the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate in 
Istanbul and facilitation of the Patriarchate\'s ability to 
continue would accrue foreign policy benefits to Turkey.  In 
this regard we will continue to pay close attention to the 
attitude toward the Patriarchate of Turkish \"Eurasianists\" -- 
i.e., those in the military, MFA, think tanks and business 
world who advocate closer ties to Russia as an alternative to 
Turkey\'s U.S/EU orientation.

EU, BUT TAKES SWIPES AT U.S., EU, AND DOMESTIC \"OPPONENTS\" 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Declaring at a globalization conference that 
the Turkish military is not against Turkey\'s pursuit of EU 
membership, deputy chief of the TGS Buyukanit further 
qualified the military\'s stance with a series of reservations 
and an indirect but clear set of jabs at the U.S.  End 
summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Opening a Turkish Armed Forces-sponsored symposium 
on globalization at the Military Academy in Istanbul on May 
29, Turkish General Staff (TGS) deputy Yasar Buyukanit 
declared that the Turkish Armed Forces cannot be against the 
EU because the EU is the \"ultimate condition\" for realizing 
Ataturk\'s modernization targets.  He went on to denounce 
claims that the Turkish military opposed European Union 
membership as an \"unfair attack.\"  He called for the EU to 
treat Turkey\'s \"40-year old\" membership application \"without 
any prejudice.\"  At the same time, Buyukanit denounced past 
foreign support for domestic terrorism (i.e., Kurdish 
separatism) by countries using the guise of \"trying to teach 
us human rights.\"  Buyukanit also warned those with \"archaic 
and separatist goals\" that EU membership could not be used as 
a means to advance their objectives. 
 
 
3. (SBU) In thinly-veiled criticism of the U.S. and Western 
Europe, Buyukanit criticized \"developed\" and \"hegemonic\" 
states for not being sensitive to local concerns in pursuing 
policies that \"exploit ethnic diversities\" and \"damage social 
stability\" in developing countries.  While condemning 
terrorism, Buyukanit said that \"powerful countries\" must also 
pursue strategies that are in compliance with international 
law.  Finally, in light of vast income disparities, developed 
countries should be less \"stingy\" in their approach to 
developing countries. 
 
 
4. (C) Amidst continuing speculation following remarks by NSC 
Secretary-General Kilinc and subsequent remarks by TGS Chief 
 
SIPDIS 
Ozkok, conference attendees (including many of Turkey\'s most 
prominent columnists, academics, and retired diplomats and 
generals) expected Buyukanit to deliver a message confirming 
the military\'s commitment to Turkey\'s EU membership. 
Although most appeared encouraged by his remarks, some of the 
attendess were unconvinced.  Ilnur Cevik, editor and 
columnist for the English-language Turkish Daily News, 
pointed out to poloff that Buyukanit had given no specifics 
on the necessary steps that the military itself would have to 
take for Turkey to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria.  One 
foreign analyst and long-time Turkey resident was 
particularly struck by the jabs at the U.S.  In remarks to 
Pol Counselor in Ankara, leading commentator Cengiz Candar 
agreed with this latter assessment.  Candar saw Buyukanit as 
using the EU-candidacy-related portion of his remarks (with 
support for EU candidacy couched in negative terms, i.e. the 
Armed Forces \"cannot be against\") as a mere lead-in to a 
criticism of the U.S. and a warning to domestic groups the 
military judges to be against Ataturkist principles. 
 
 
5. (U) Other columnists also picked up on the negative 
message: Sedat Ergin in centrist mass-circulation \"Hurriyet\" 
focused on Buyukanit\'s criticism of the U.S. and 
globalization; Himet Bila in Kemalist \"Cumhuriyet\" 
interpreted the remarks as a warning to the West and a 
defiant statement against those who want to see the Turkish 
military\'s influence wane. 
 
 
6. (C) Comment: lack of specifics and swipes at the U.S. and 
EU in Buyukanit\'s remarks have left many questions 
unanswered.  Some of our Istanbul contacts worry that at a 
time when the TGS is making critical decisions about 
senior-level appointments, TGS Chief Ozkok appears to be more 
and more isolated.  Hurriyet columnist Cuneyt Ulsever told 
poloff before the speech that he is worried about divisions 
within the top brass and thinks some anti-EU hard-liners may 
be looking for an \"emergency\" to justify extending in their 
positions for another year.

SUBJECT: TACKLING TURKEY\'S PRODUCTIVITY GAP: MICRO MATTERS 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: While most attention in Turkey remains 
focused on the country\'s macroeconomic fundamentals, a new 
McKinsey Global Institute report is directing attention to 
the productivity gap that separates Turkey from the U.S. and 
Europe and the microeconomic reforms that must be taken to 
close it.  Highlighted are the need to reduce the high level 
of informality in the Turkish economy, to ensure that 
liberalization of utilities occurs only in a \"robust\" 
regulatory and judicial environment, and to redouble efforts 
to smooth economic volatility.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Lagging Productivity: The McKinsey study, 15 months 
in the making, estimates that overall productivity levels in 
Turkey are just one-half of their potential, averaging 40 
percent of U.S. levels for labor, and 50 percent overall. 
The estimate reflects both low total factor productivity (at 
Korea\'s level) and a declining level of total factor inputs 
(more akin to Brazil) over the last decade.  The overall 
figure masks the key attribute of the Turkish economy, 
however: bi-modality, whereby modern and traditional/informal 
sectors uneasily coexist in particular industries.  In the 
modern sector productivity can approach 65 percent of the 
U.S. level, in traditional areas it is less half that. 
Normally such inefficient firms would be squeezed out of the 
market, but because of the \"unfair\" advantages they receive 
by operating \"informally\" and avoiding tax, social security 
and regulatory requirements, they are able to stay in 
business.  While conceding that structural impediments make 
it unrealistic for Turkey to reach U.S. productivity levels 
in the medium term, the report argues that Turkey could reach 
70 percent of U.S. levels if it adopted the correct policy 
mix.  Such a course, McKinsey argues, could unleash growth 
averaging 8.5 percent a year from 2005-2015, and create 6 
million new jobs (coincidentally matching the number a recent 
TUSIAD report estimated must be created to put Turkey\'s 
worsening unemployment dynamics on a positive track). 
 
 
3. McKinsey\'s Action Plan: Arguing that Turkey is fortunate 
in that it does not suffer \"death from a thousand cuts,\" 
McKinsey argues that its three highlighted factors explain 
over 90 percent of Turkey\'s productivity shortfall.  To 
address them, it pushes for the following: 
 
 
-- Informality: McKinsey recommends a carrot and stick 
approach to give firms now operating in the shadow economy an 
incentive to move into the modern sector.  While Turkey\'s 
ability to offer \"carrots\" is constrained by its need to 
maintain a strong primary surplus to support the IMF reform 
package (though the study notes that if VAT fulfillment rose 
from 64 to 90 percent, the rate could be lowered from 18 to 
13 percent without any impact on revenue), McKinsey 
recommends the government facilitate enterprise access to 
information and know-how, modelled on current EU programs 
that support SME\'s.  As a stick, the report pushes for 
stricter and more effective enforcement of company 
obligations, but concedes that this cannot be done across the 
board, but must instead be targeted at specific sectors.  It 
suggests starting with the VAT in the retail sector, and then 
moving upstream and downstream. 
 
 
-- Monopoly Market Liberalization: McKinsey reiterates the 
need for Turkey to liberalize its monopoly sectors-- 
especially telecommunications and electricity-- but stresses 
that this must be done in an effective and \"unambiguous\" 
regulatory and judicial framework.  It points to Telecom 
Italia Mobile\'s recent difficulties as an example of how a 
weak regulatory structure has permitted sector incumbents to 
block a competitive challenge, and the improved productivity 
such a challenge would bring. 
 
 
-- Macroeconomic and political stability: McKinsey highlights 
the distortions that Turkey\'s recent instability have brought 
to business operations, and the way in which it has hampered 
productivity.  While at the simplest level Turkey\'s shifts 
over the last decade from boom to contraction have made 
capacity planning virtually impossible, the resultant high 
interest rates and inflation that have characterized the 
economy have skewed managerial priorities, putting a higher 
premium on cash-flow management, for instance, than on 
operational or productivity improvements.  (One contact in 
the food sector notes that supermarkets in Turkey have 
routinely earned profits above 20 percent, 2/3\'s of which 
stems from their ability to impose 120-day payment terms on 
their suppliers, rather than from any innate efficiency.) 
 
 
4. (SBU) Positive Reaction: In a meeting with P/E Chief on 
April 30, McKinsey Director David Meen indicated that 
reaction to the report in business and industrial circles had 
been uniformly positive, and that its analysis and 
conclusions were widely accepted.  He conceded that the 
report had had less impact in Ankara than McKinsey had hoped, 
given that it appeared in the run-up to the Iraq war, when 
the capital\'s attention was directed elsewhere.  However, he 
indicated that the firm has had fruitful contacts with both 
State Minister Babacan and the Energy and Transportation 
Ministries regarding its specific regulatory suggestions. 
Babacan, he said, was particularly intrigued by the 
suggestions on informality.  To raise the report\'s profile 
further, Meen said that McKinsey will soon organize a series 
of conferences in Ankara, with the assistance of the Union of 
Chambers of Commerce (TOBB).  He emphasized, however (and 
reiterated the point in a May 8 speech at the \"Forum 
Istanbul\" conference), that he is waiting to be convinced 
about the government\'s commitment to transform words into 
actions. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: The McKinsey report is well timed, and 
reaffirms from a productivity standpoint the importance of 
getting Turkey\'s macro fundamentals right, while also 
outlining a number of micro steps that can also bridge 
another significant part of Turkey\'s productivity shortfall. 
Some question whether taking on the informal sector is a wise 
policy choice, given the important role it has played in 
cushioning the impact of recent economic crises.  But 
McKinsey makes a convincing case that the virtuous cycle 
created by reducing informality and improving productivity 
would ultimately produce income and jobs far outweighing 
those lost through the informal sector\'s contraction.  End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: EXPORTS REMAIN STRONG, BUT LIRA WORRIES PERSIST 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: New figures released by the Turkish 
Exporters Assembly (TIM) on June 2 show that Turkey\'s 
exporters withstood the challenge of a strengthening lira and 
set a new monthly export record of USD 3.9 billion in May, a 
30.7 percent increase over 2002.  For the year ending May 31, 
exports were USD 40.7 billion, up 28 percent from the 
previous 12 month period.  Meanwhile, however, declining 
tourism revenues and an even sharper pickup in imports led 
the GOT to revise its 2003 current account deficit projection 
from USD 3.7 billion to 6.1 billion.  Exporters warned too 
that the appreciating lira threatens their competitiveness 
and added their voice to calls on the Central Bank for a 
decline in interest rates and more consistent exchange rate 
policy.  Central Bank officials counter that continued low 
unit labor costs and productivity increases are keeping 
Turkish exports competitive, and that exporters are focusing 
excessively on the lira-dollar rate, which--for trade 
purposes--is much less important than the lira-Euro rate, 
where the lira\'s appreciation has been much smaller.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) A new record: The statistics unveiled June 2 in 
Istanbul show Turkish exports moving from record to record, 
with April\'s USD 3.74 billion giving way to May\'s 3.916 
billion, despite the lira\'s appreciation.  For the first five 
months of the year exports were USD 17.9 billion (versus 
13.36 billion in the same period last year), while for the 
last twelve months they totalled USD 40.7 billion.  The 
record was paced by sharp gains in exports of textiles (up 
28.6 percent to USD 993 million) and automotive products (up 
48.4 percent to USD 596 million). 
 
 
3. (SBU) But a widening deficit: Even with the export record, 
however, the GOT also moved on June 2 to revise Turkey\'s 
projected 2003 current account deficit up to USD 6.1 billion. 
 While projected exports were revised up to 40.6 billion from 
39.4 billion, even more quickly growing imports and a 
projected decline in tourism revenues (though of a lesser 
magnitude than was predicted earlier in the year) account for 
the widening gap.  In announcing the shift, State Minister 
Babacan also pointed to the impact of the strong lira and 
what he characterized as strong private sector demand. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Statistical Anomolies: While a welcome and positive 
development, commentators argue that the headline export 
figure is not necessarily as impressive as it first appears. 
Given that the bulk of Turkey\'s exports (nearly 66 percent) 
goes to the European Union and is priced in Euros, \"Sabah\'s\" 
Abdurrahman Yildirim noted, a portion of the January-May 
increase (perhaps as much as a quarter by our rough 
calculations) stems from the Euro\'s increase in value against 
the dollar. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Shoals Ahead: In announcing the May figures, TIM 
Chairman Oguz Satici warned that notwithstanding the positive 
results of the last five months, export growth is becoming 
unsustainable because of the appreciating lira.  May\'s 
figures, he said, reflect orders placed in the first three 
months of the year, while currently exporters are coming to a 
situation where they \"cannot accept orders\" because the 
appreciating exchange rate does not permit them to accurately 
predict costs and income, and consequently prices.  Arguing 
that the current rate serves the interests of \"rentiers\" and 
not the real economy, he called for an exchange rate \"in the 
same line as inflation and input costs,\" and warned the 
Central Bank that \"those who avoid responsibility even though 
they have authority will be called to account.\" 
 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: Central Bank officials question exporters\' 
arguments.  First, they point out that, while the lira-dollar 
exchange rate is important in financial markets, the 
lira-Euro rate is much more significant for trade.  Although 
the lira has appreciated against the Euro, its rise has been 
much more modest than against the dollar.  Furthermore, 
imported inputs for exports tend to be priced in dollar 
terms, so the lira\'s appreciation against the dollar is not a 
complete negative for exporters.  In addition, these 
officials point out, Turkish exporters continue to benefit 
from low unit labor costs, which still have not recovered 
from the 2001 crisis, and from rising productivity.  End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: AKP AND THE ISTANBUL \"ESNAFLAR\": A PERFECT MATCH? 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Support from the Istanbul \"esnaflar\" ) 
small businessmen, restaurant owners, craftsmen, shopkeepers, 
street vendors, and taxi and truck drivers - may have 
contributed to the Justice and Development (AK) Party\'s 
November 2002 electoral success, but this support may be less 
solid than it appears.  Esnaflar are frustrated with their 
economic circumstances and expect Prime Minister Erdogan to 
deliver economic salvation... or at least populist hand-outs. 
 End Summary. 
 
 
\"Esnaflar\": Part of AKP\'s Base? 
------------------------------- 
2. (U) Although Turkish \"esnaflar\" ) small businessmen, 
restaurant owners, craftsmen, shopkeepers, street vendors, 
and taxi and truck drivers ) may not have the same influence 
and access that wealthier manufacturing and industrial groups 
enjoy, together they make up one of the largest sectors of 
the voting population.  The Turkish Esnaflar and Artisan 
Union, an umbrella organization for 172 different esnaflar 
chambers, claims to represent 3 million Istanbul residents 
(700,000 registered members and their families), about a 
quarter of the population.  Narrow profit margins, a greedy 
and corrupt bureaucracy, and a lack of access to credit and 
loans have left most of Istanbul\'s esnaflar on the edge of 
poverty.  The two-year old economic crisis hit this group 
especially hard, forcing many into bankruptcy and the ranks 
of the unemployed and others onto the streets to protest 
government demands that they pay outstanding social security 
debt and personal loans. 
 
 
3. (SBU) This combination of voting power and desperation has 
made this group a major target for political parties in 
Turkey.  Although it is difficult to make generalizations, 
anecdotal evidence and common wisdom suggest that, in line 
with the majority of the Turkish population, esnaflar tend to 
be both politically conservative and religiously devout, 
voting mostly for right-wing parties.  The Board of the 
Istanbul Esnaflar and Artisan Union (IESB), for example, 
includes an adviser to the Chairman of the True Path Party, a 
senior Istanbul Motherland Party official, and two Justice 
and Development (AK) Party members.  Suat Yalkin, IESB 
President for the last 18 years, told poloff that IESB is 
careful not to endorse particular parties, but he conceded 
that IESB members provided significant support to the AK 
Party in last November\'s elections, despite the fact that 
IESB had specifically distanced itself from the now-banned 
Welfare and Virtue Parties for their Islamic leanings. 
 
 
Frustration or Fanaticisim? 
--------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Our anecdotal contacts with typical esnaflar 
restaurant owners and shopkeepers confirm that AK made 
inroads into these groups.  One restaurateur admitted to 
voting for AK, citing frustration with the difficult economic 
situation and the ineffective and corrupt politicians in 
Ankara as his motivating factor.  A shopkeeper said he voted 
for AK because of his confidence in former Istanbul Mayor and 
AK Chairman Tayyip Erdogan.  We have heard similar accounts 
from vegetable sellers, tailors, and small shop owners.  On 
the other hand, for every AK supporter we have met, other 
esnaflar told us that they have given up on politicians 
altogether and did not vote at all in the last elections.  On 
the whole, our sense is that AK support among the esnaflar 
rests on Erdogan\'s charisma, AK\'s \"clean\" reputation, and 
growing frustration with the inability of \"corrupt\" Ankara 
politicians to address the crippling economic situation. 
Rarely have we encountered esnaflar that supported AK for 
purely ideological reasons. 
 
 
Can AKP and Erdogan Deliver? 
---------------------------- 
5. (SBU) IESB President Yalkin claimed that despite this 
support, AK has not been particularly responsive to esnaflar 
concerns.  According to Yalkin, esnaflar have almost no ready 
access to credit and bank loans.  (Note: This is a frequent 
complaint we hear from esnaflar, who claim that because such 
credits are unavailable, they must save up their own money or 
borrow from friends and family.)  Yalkin complained that the 
ratio between loans to small and large businesses in Turkey 
is less than 1:100, while in most western economies the 
figure is closer to 50:50.  This notwithstanding, Yalkin 
complained that the AK government has so far refused to take 
measures to prevent the privatization of state-owned Halk 
Bank, the only institution that has been willing to lend to 
esnaflar in the past.  Esnaflar, like the Turkish farmers, 
have also pushed the government to forgive their 
non-performing bank loans (USD 20 to 40 million). 
 
 
6. (SBU) Yalkin allowed, however, that Erdogan seemed to be 
making a personal effort.  Following an appeal from esnaflar 
representatives, Erdogan tripled the amount of a small credit 
fund for esnaflar in the 2003 budget (increasing it to 
approximately USD 80 million).  Erdogan also eliminated a 
requirement that potential applicants pay all of their 
arrears to the state pension fund (a condition almost none of 
them can satisfy).  Yalkin claims that the 44 percent 
interest rate for the fund has limited its utility (only 
one-third of the money has been disbursed), but he believes 
that Erdogan may lower the rate by another ten percent when 
he addresses a gathering of esnaflar in Ankara on June 24. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
7. (SBU) Many have pointed to esnaflar support as one of the 
factors that underpinned AKP\'s electoral success in Istanbul. 
 Absent any comprehensive studies it is difficult to draw 
definitive conclusions, but it is probably safe to say that 
they supported AKP in numbers equal to or greater than the 
general population.  Anecdotal conversations with individual 
shopkeepers and other esnaflar, however, suggest that this 
support may be skin-deep and highly dependent on AKP\'s 
ability to turn the economy around or at least deliver 
populist hand-outs, including subsidized credits and loan 
forgiveness.  A similar perception within AK doubtless 
explains the government\'s intermittent populist gestures, 
which have periodically roiled Turkish markets and put in 
doubt its commitment to economic reform.

SUBJECT: AKP ISTANBUL CONGRESS: \"MUEZZINOGLU RELOADED\" 
 
 
1. (U) Justice and Development (AK) Party Chairman and Prime 
Minister Tayyip Erdogan headlined the June 22 AK Istanbul 
Congress.  There were no surprises (in fact, no challengers 
at all) in the reelection of Istanbul Chairman Mehmet 
Muezzinoglu, and Erdogan\'s unscripted speech focused on 
predictably populist themes that would resonate with the 
10,000 party faithful and luminaries in the audience: 
 
 
- Education: promised free textbooks and private-school 
vouchers for 10,000 students; 
- Energy: promised new dams and cheaper electricity; 
- Foreign Policy: promised to push forward with EU membership; 
- Party Ideology: reaffirmed that AKP is a conservative 
democratic party that is open to all (i.e., headscarved or 
not) and committed to Ataturk\'s secularist principles. 
 
 
2. (U) Erdogan also made news by remarking that he would soon 
reveal estimates on the staggering extent of corruption in 
Turkey.  He warned the labor unions not to make unreasonable 
demands and cautioned all of his supporters not to expect the 
economic situation to improve immediately (i.e, give us at 
least 3 years).  In an indirect reference to Young Party (GP) 
Chairman Cem Uzan\'s verbal attacks and subsequent legal 
charges against him, Erdogan said that he was content to let 
the courts handle the issue.  Following his speech, Erdogan 
welcomed a few dozen new members into the party, most of whom 
had defected from local positions in the Motherland Party 
(ANAP), including Bahcelievler Mayor Saffet Bulut. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Comment: Erdogan\'s speech was a further 
demonstration of his political talent, charismatic appeal, 
and keen understanding of his constituents.  Clearly his 
die-hard Istanbul supporters are willing to give him and his 
government time to make their mark, but it remains to be seen 
whether the wider AK support base will be as patient.

SUBJECT: SULTANBEYLI: A HIGHWAY RUNS THROUGH IT... AND 
DOESN\'T STOP 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary and Comment: A recent visit to Sultanbeyli, 
one of Istanbul\'s poorer Asian districts, highlights how 
Turkey\'s uneven economic gains in recent years have widened 
the gap between the \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\"  The modern 
Istanbul-Ankara highway runs right through this conservative, 
pious neighborhood, but with the nearest exit/on-ramp 15 
minutes away, Sultanbeyli residents are reminded that theirs 
is a less privileged district.  Voters here have turned out 
in large numbers to support successive Islam-oriented parties 
and gave the Justice and Development (AK) Party over 53 
percent of the local vote in 2002 national elections. 
Although support for AK currently remains strong, success in 
future elections will also depend on whether the AK 
government can deliver a locally popular 
property-registration amnesty and long-term economic 
development and opportunities.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Less than thirty years ago, Sultanbeyli was a 
sparsely populated rural area inland from the Bosphorus and 
the Gulf of Izmit.  Massive immigration from Erzurum, Sivas, 
and the Black Sea region made this one of the fastest-growing 
districts in the country.  It was also widely known as one of 
the most conservative and religious districts of Istanbul by 
the mid-1990s.  Since becoming a district (ilce) in 1989, the 
mayoralty has been held by Islamic-oriented Welfare (Refah), 
Fazilet (Virtue), and Saadet (Felicity) party candidates. 
Local residents confirm that as recently as five years ago, a 
large percentage of the women wore not just headscarves, but 
the full carsaf (chador).  The appointment of a dynamic 
district governor and the increasingly pragmatic approach of 
the mayor marked a shift that gave the district a more 
moderate feel.  However, in the main, Sultanbeyli residents 
remain conservative.  The imam at one of the town\'s largest 
mosques claimed that the local mosques attract sizable crowds 
for daily prayers and overflow with faithful on Fridays, 
although it was impossible for us to have a free conversation 
with him since the district mufti (representative of the 
state\'s religious affairs directorate) showed up to monitor 
the imam and dominate the conversation. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Saadet Party Mayor Yahya Karakaya told poloffs that 
the population growth had exceeded the district\'s ability to 
extend municipal services.  Although immigration and growth 
have tapered off, his principal challenges as mayor are to 
expand the basic water, natural gas, and road infrastructure 
to the full population.  Additionally, up to 75 percent of 
Sultanbeyli residents lack building authorization and 
property deeds, leading them to complain that they have no 
protection or guarantees that they won\'t be evicted and/or 
have their property confiscated.  Although there is some 
local industry, Karakaya said, it does not go far in 
providing local employment opportunities.  Unemployment is 
high and is demonstrated by the fact that some of the 30,000 
unemployed line up daily along the main street hoping to find 
day jobs with contractors looking for cheap labor.  Most of 
those lucky enough to have full-time jobs must board buses 
each morning for the hour-long journey to Mediyekoy, Sisli, 
and other Istanbul European districts. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Local politicians from several parties told visiting 
poloffs that Sultanbeyli is a Justice and Development (AK) 
Party stronghold.  Although the mayor is from rival Necmettin 
Erbakan\'s Saadet Party, he, too, professed a deep admiration 
for AKP Chairman Tayyip Erdogan and open support for the AK 
government\'s policies because he sees them as reasonable, not 
radical.  In the November 2002 elections, 53 percent of 
Sultanbeyli voters turned out to support AK, compared to only 
37 percent in Istanbul  as a whole.  Although no specific AKP 
candidate has emerged, newly-elected local AK Party Chairman 
Omer Ozkartal told poloffs that he expects the party to get 
as much as 60 percent or more of the vote in the spring 2004 
municipal elections.  Local Republican People\'s Party (CHP) 
officials made no effort to dismiss such claims.  In a sign 
that he doesn\'t take such support for granted, however, 
Ozkartal was quick to echo the mayor\'s call regarding the 
need to push forward with a property amnesty and to note that 
as long as the Istanbul-Ankara highway that bisects their 
neighborhood merely passes them by, Sultanbeyli residents 
will not be satisfied. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Staunchly \"secularist\" CHP reps acknowledged that 
Sultanbeyli has moderated considerably from what they 
described as an oppressively Islamist atmosphere until 
several years ago.  More interested in a real exchange of 
views with us than the more openly anti-American local CHP 
organizations in other parts of the country, the reps 
nevertheless displayed a strong conspiracy-theory approach in 
peppering us with questions about U.S. intentions. 
 
 
6. (SBU) The district chairman of Motorola deadbeat Cem 
Uzan\'s Genc Party acknowledged that Genc would not win the 
mayoral elections on its own, but might have a chance if it 
combined with other parties under a unified candidate.  With 
a portrait of Uzan, considered by a majority of Turks as 
corruption personified, on the wall behind him, he went on to 
criticize the widespread nature of corruption in Turkey.

SUBJECT: GENC (YOUNG) PARTY MACHINATIONS IN KIRKLARELI 
PROVINCE 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
 
 
1. (C) Genc (Young) Party is in the process of attempting to 
build a Turkey-wide base of support, seeking to co-opt local 
politicians and appeal to broadly-nationalist sentiment. 
Conversations with political leaders in one rural province 
suggest that the combination of political ambition, murky 
business dealings, and strong-arm tactics has left some of 
the target audience wary of Cem Uzan and his party. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Genc Comes to Kirklareli 
------------------------ 
 
 
2. (U) Kirklareli is the capital of the province of the same 
name in Trakya (European Turkey), a city of 53,000 people, 
with an economy centered on farming and border trade with 
Bulgaria.  Kirklareli has a long history of center-left 
voting, and CHP took the largest share in the last elections. 
 AK and Genc Party, both competing for center-right votes, 
took second and third.  Longer-standing parties that 
previously did well in the province (such as MHP, DYP, ANAP, 
and DSP) were badly defeated, taking on average just a few 
percent of the vote. 
 
 
3. (C) Genc Party has sought to consolidate and build upon 
its base in Kirklareli in the wake of the November election, 
establishing a party headquarters, courting local 
politicians, and publicizing its populist rhetoric.  The 
strategy, it appears, can only take Genc so far, as evidenced 
by the comments of contacts in Kirklareli.  The province, 
though a political backwater in itself, may be indicative of 
a large segment of the rural and newly-urban voters who have 
displayed some reticence toward Genc. 
 
 
----------------------- 
By Any Means Necessary? 
----------------------- 
 
 
4. (C) In the run-up to the November 2002 election, Kirkareli 
sources report that Genc Party used particularly aggressive 
tactics to attract voters there, including: forcing employees 
of Telsim, Imar Bankasi, and other Uzan family businesses to 
join Genc, using Uzan media outlets (including cell-phone 
text messaging) to drive home the Genc message, increasing 
profits to Uzan sub-contractors and distributors who visibly 
supported the party and providing free cement for home 
building to poorer segments of the population from the Uzans\' 
nearby Halapasa Cement Factory. 
 
 
5. (C) According to Kirklareli Mayor Cengiz Bagdan, many 
local politicians were also approached to join Genc, himself 
included.  Bagdan professes no interest currently in leaving 
nationalist MHP, though he admits that may change as local 
elections get closer. 
 
 
6. (C) Separately, Sait Lutfu Gur, Chairman of the Chamber of 
Tradesmen and Craftsmen, confirmed Genc Party\'s aggressive 
politics.  Gur believes, however, that the nationalist 
rhetoric of Genc combined with strong-arm tactics has little 
resonance in this area of Turkey.  Kirklareli\'s economy was 
more lightly affected than elsewhere by economic crises, and 
has significantly less unemployment.  Benefiting from free 
trade, Gur and his colleaugues passionately argued for a 
reduction in trade barriers as the best way to help the 
Turkish economy, which runs against some of Genc\'s more 
strident xenophobic rhetoric. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
7. (C) Rural, statist, and moderately conservative, 
Kirklareli has many traits similar to other Genc strongholds. 
 Some of Genc\'s more unseemly strong arm tactics have kept a 
lid on any budding enthusiasm there, especially when coupled 
with Kirklareli\'s pro-trade, left-of-center attitudes.

2. (SBU) Summary: Istanbul market analysts have welcomed 
recent progress in Turkey-IMF relations and indications that 
the oft-delayed fifth review can be wrapped up by early to 
mid-August.  As a result they are \"optimistic\" for the short 
term, seeing no clouds on the immediate horizon and believing 
investors can realize 8-9 percent returns over the next two 
months in dollar terms on Turkish bonds.  Beyond this market 
play, however, they warn us that overall sentiment is not 
good, and they continue to see significant \"implementation 
risks\" for the fall, particularly as the tougher requirements 
of the sixth review come into play.  The wild card in the 
picture remains the strong Turkish lira, which analysts 
continue to have difficulty explaining.  Criticism of the 
Central Bank is growing, however, with few buying its 
argument that its interventions have been aimed solely at 
curbing volatility in the market.  End Summary. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Guarded Optimism: Recent soundings with analysts at 
Istanbul brokerages and banks show that optimism is 
increasing, at least for the immediate future.  Bender 
analysts Emin Ozturk and Murat Gulkan, who earlier this year 
highlighted to us the frequent failure of the summer \"carry 
trade\" (purchasing government bonds to earn high rates, while 
counting on the exchange rate to stay fairly stable) to be as 
profitable as markets expected, told us this week that, this 
year at least, the bet appears to have paid off.  Baturalp 
Candemir at HC Istanbul shares that view, arguing that with 
no major clouds on the horizon following progress registered 
during the recent IMF mission, investors should be able to 
realize 8-9 percent in dollar terms over the next two months. 
 In a world where investors are scraping to realize 2 percent 
elsewhere annually, the opportunity makes Turkey appear very 
attractive, despite its currently overvalued exchange rate. 
Ozturk and Gulkan noted that while July and August are 
typically \"dead\" periods at their firm, this year the phone 
has been ringing off the hook with inquiries about 
opportunities in Turkey. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Implementation Risk: While progress registered 
during the recently concluded IMF mission removed the last 
clouds from the short-term horizon of these analysts, 
Candemir did express some scepticism about whether the 
additional financial measures the IMF and government have 
agreed on will prove sufficient to achieve the program\'s 6.5 
percent primary surplus target.  The IMF\'s blessing, he said, 
however, would be enough to satisfy the markets.  For the 
longer term he is less sanguine, seeing significant 
implementation risk, particularly if his expectation is met 
that these measures will be insufficient.  Given the 
political difficulties inherent in laying off more employees 
at state-owned enterprises, he predicted that the sixth 
review would drag on until the end of the year.  The real 
crunch, most analysts here suggest, will begin in September, 
as investors start to worry about next year\'s debt burden, 
and intensify in the second half of October, when 
government-IMF discussion of the 2004 budget begins in 
earnest.  Ozturk and Gulkan note that while the AK government 
has \"moved up a learning curve,\" the ingredient that is 
currently missing is word about their plans for next year: 
Will it seek to scale back the primary surplus, or accept 
that it needs to be maintained at a high level?  Key to 
market stability at that point, Candemir argued, will be 
evidence that promised U.S. assistance is on track, and 
continued reform implementation. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Exchange rate dynamics:  The key wild card in the 
current economic picture is the strong Turkish lira, which 
has gone from strength to strength, shrugging off the Central 
Bank\'s July 18 intervention and not losing ground to the 
dollar, even as it has strengthened against other currencies. 
 Observers remain divided on the reasons for the lira\'s 
strength.  Some, like Candemir, see \"under the mattress\" 
money reentering the system to benefit from high interest 
rates and to participate in various recent economic 
amnesties.  Others, like former Yapi Kredi Chairman Burhan 
Karacam, see other issues at work, attributing the lira\'s 
rise to a timing gap between payments for imports and 
exports.  Karacam suggests that a large supply of dollars 
accumulated in the run-up to the Iraq war, as exporters held 
off exchanging their earnings in expectation that the lira 
would weaken.  When the war ended quickly, those dollars 
flooded into the market, driving its rate down.  In contrast, 
however, while Turkey\'s current account deficit would suggest 
there should be strong demand for dollars, in fact importers 
utilize delayed payment terms and invest the money in 
short-term government bonds to benefit from high real rates. 
Karacam suggests that many of these payments come due in 
mid-October, at which point he predicts that there could well 
be a \"squeeze\" in the currency market, and a sudden sharp 
drop in the lira.  (Karacam noted that he recently made these 
points to Central Bank governor Serdengecti, who is looking 
into the issue.) 
 
 
6. (SBU) Differences: Not all agree with this explanation, 
however.  While most see merit in the first part of the 
story, in the flood of dollars that followed the war, they 
are less convinced that most importers are deferring their 
payments to the fall.  (Our random sampling of importers 
confirms that such extended payment terms are not by any 
means general.)  Ozturk and Gulkan suggest a combination of 
other factors can explain most recent developments: in 
addition to \"under the mattress\" money, some \"hot money\" has 
flowed into the market (perhaps 1.5 billion usd), while 
Turkish financial institutions (acting largely through 
subsidiaries, since under BDDK rules limit their ability to 
do so themselves) have opened short positions.  Candemir 
noted that he had expected the lira to continue to appreciate 
to 1.35 million during August, due to an essential balance in 
currency inflows and outflows.  The Central Bank\'s recent 
intervention, however, has changed the market\'s dynamics. 
Far from easing the market\'s volatility, he suggested, it has 
increased it.  Ozturk was similarly critical, suggesting that 
the bank had \"panicked\" because of the failure of its recent 
interest rate cut to move the currency. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Bank Credibility: Both Ozturk and Candemir warn that 
the key risk from the bank\'s recent intervention is to its 
credibility.  While it continues to insist that it is acting 
only to prevent market \"volatility,\" many observers have 
concluded that its true concern is the currency\'s value. 
With the government enjoying only limited credibility in the 
market, Candemir warned that if the bank similarly \"loses 
credibility,\" it will leave the country without any credible 
voices on economic policy. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: Though the underlying dynamics of concern 
with the long-term plans of the AK government on economic 
policy have not changed, clearly recent progress on the 5th 
review and Turkey\'s traditional \"summer optimism\" have 
combined to give the government some much needed breathing 
space.  That will not last forever, however.  As Mehmet 
Besimoglu wrote in Radikal on July 21, because it\'s summer 
there is a \"tendency to see the glass as being half full; if 
necessary measures are not taken before fall attention will 
shift to the empty half.\"  Istanbul analysts worry, though, 
that such warnings may now have little resonance.  Just as 
the government has little credibility with them, so they have 
little credibility with it, in that their warnings of dire 
consequences for the government\'s policy missteps have not 
been realized.  End Comment.

TENSIONS 
 
 
REF: ISTANBUL 399 
 
 
Classified By: Consul-General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b & d). 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II advised the Ambassador 
during his July 16 farewell call that aggressive efforts by 
the Armenian Catholicos in Etchmiadzin to assert primacy over 
the Armenian community in Turkey could increase Turkish 
tensions on the Armenian issue in the coming months. 
Specifically, the Catholicos expects to complete work in 
October on a \"constitution\" for the Armenian Church that 
would claim that all unused or vacated church properties 
around the world should revert to Etchmiadzin.  Given the 
extreme sensitivity regarding properties owned by the 
minority religious communities in Turkey, Mesrob opined that 
such efforts would almost certainly feed nationalist 
suspicions regarding Armenian claims on Turkish property. 
While conceding that there would be serious questions about 
the legal validity of such a \"constitution\" for Armenian 
communities in countries around the world, Mesrob argued that 
at a minimum such claims would raise bilateral tensions 
between Ankara and Yerevan. 
 
 
2. (SBU)  Mesrob added that the \"constitution\" issue is 
merely the latest in a series of attempts by Etchmiadzin (and 
Yerevan) to assert its primacy over Armenian communities 
around the world, including those that fall under the 
Patriarchs of Istanbul, Silicia, and Jerusalem (reftel). 
Together these three Patriarchs have resisted these efforts, 
but their objections are unlikely to block the new 
constitution.  Mesrob also claimed that medals recently 
awarded to members of the local community by the Catholicos 
(without consulting the Istanbul Patriarchate) were further 
evidence of an attempt to assert its primacy and to divide 
the local community. 
 
 
3. (SBU)  Mesrob told the Ambassador that he had recently 
sent a letter to the Turkish Foreign Ministry to alert them 
to these efforts and warn of the increased tension that 
extraterritorial claims could impose on the Armenian issue. 
Mesrob admitted that he is worried the Ministry may not 
interpret his letter in the \"good faith\" in which it was 
intended.  In addition to a general warning, Mesrob said that 
he had used the letter as an opportunity to argue that the 
minorities in Turkey be given \"legal status\" in order to 
resist efforts by other elements of the Armenian Church to 
assert authority within the Armenian community in Turkey. 
 
 
4. (C) Comment: When it comes to the volatile issues of the 
Armenian \"genocide\" and Turkish-Armenian relations, the 
70,000-strong Armenian community in Turkey regularly finds 
itself caught between a rock (Armenia, the Armenian Orthodox 
Church, and the Armenian Diaspora) and a hard place (Turkey). 
 If Mesrob\'s description of the ongoing developments within 
the Armenian Church proves accurate, this issue could become 
yet another source of tension between Armenia and Turkey.

SUBJECT: WAITING FOR THE BIG ONE... IS ISTANBUL PREPARED 
FOR AN EARTHQUAKE? 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Despite continued public awareness about 
the likelihood of a major earthquake in the next 30 years, 
Istanbul remains ill-prepared for a major natural disaster. 
To the extent that municipal and state officials have begun 
to focus on this critical issue, the bulk of their attention 
has been on response efforts and not the more difficult 
mitigation efforts.  End Summary. 
 
 
Waiting for the Big One... 
-------------------------- 
2. (U) Lying just off of the Northern Anatolian fault line, 
Istanbul (and its prior incarnations as Constantinople and 
Byzantium) has experienced major earthquakes every 100 to 150 
years during its long history.  The question is not whether 
an earthquake will occur, but rather when and how damaging it 
will be.  A sequential westward progression of major 
earthquakes this century has led experts to believe that 
there is now a 65 percent probability of a major earthquake 
near Istanbul in the next 30 years.  What troubles these 
experts and municipal authorities is the fact that modern 
Istanbul has grown in population from under a million to 
approximately 12 million in just two generations.  Most of 
this vast expansion has taken place in the absence of 
sensible land-use planning and earthquake-resistant 
construction.  These same problems led to the tens of 
thousands of deaths in the 1999 Kocaeli/Izmit earthquake, 
whereas similar magnitude earthquakes in developed countries 
with modern urban planning and construction cause relatively 
less damage (49 deaths in San Francisco/Oakland in 1989). 
 
 
3. (U) Recent studies (including one funded by the American 
Red Cross) indicate that a major earthquake (7.5 on the 
Richter scale) in the immediate vicinity of Istanbul is 
expected to claim 40-50,000 lives and cost USD 11-12 billion 
in direct building damages (not including other property 
damage, secondary losses in productivity, and a million or 
more homeless).  Severe shaking during the 1999 Izmit quake 
claimed almost a thousand lives and damaged over 23,000 
buildings in the Istanbul neighborhood of Avcilar (over 80 km 
from the epicenter but consisting mostly of unstable land) 
and forced Istanbul residents to flee their houses and 
prompted many to sleep in the streets for days.  Recent polls 
suggest that the psychological damage has endured: 58 percent 
of the city\'s residents are expecting a major earthquake, 29 
percent have moved (or plan to move) to \"safer\" 
neighborhoods, and 40 percent say that only their work 
prevents them from leaving the city altogether.  As recently 
as July 9, rumors of an impending earthquake panicked 
Istanbul residents until the Kandilli Observatory and 
municipal authorities debunked the scare. 
 
 
Challenges to Disaster Preparedness 
----------------------------------- 
4. (U) WHO\'S IN CHARGE?: The problems and challenges involved 
in preparing for an earthquake are considerable.  They begin 
with the question of authority.  Outdated laws from the 1950s 
(when Turkey was predominantly rural) formally delegate 
disaster response to the national government and to its 
representatives around the country (i.e., state-appointed 
governors).  The Civil Defense Directorate of the Ministry of 
Interior employs 2000 people around the country, but their 
mandate and training deal primarily with the Cold War threat 
of nuclear attack, not disaster preparedness.  Although an 
Emergency Management Agency was created several years ago, 
its role vis-a-vis other disaster management agencies remains 
undefined.  The scale of the problem in large urban areas, 
moreover, is far beyond the capacity of local governors and 
has been unable to attract sufficient resources from a 
government preoccupied with an ongoing economic crisis.  In 
the absence of a national response on this issue of critical 
concern, the Istanbul municipal authorities have stepped into 
the vacuum, working closely with the governor\'s office and 
local organizations to coordinate unified earthquake 
preparations.  But tension between municipal and state 
authorities has created major problems, obstacles, and delays 
in advancing the city\'s level of preparedness.  Schools, 
hospitals, and cultural heritage fall directly under state, 
not municipal, control. 
 
 
5. (U) RESPONSE VERSUS MITIGATION: Earthquake preparations 
fall into two general categories: response and mitigation. 
Major steps have already been taken with regard to upgrading 
and reinforcing the city\'s ability to respond to an 
earthquake (training rescue teams and firefighters, 
pre-positioning supplies), but the much larger and more 
expensive mitigation efforts have only just begun.  The 
Istanbul Muncipality, Turkish Red Crescent (with American Red 
Cross assistance), and others have upgraded their response 
preparations.  Prof. Nuray Aydinoglu, head of the Kandilli 
Observatory (Turkey\'s premier earthquake research institute) 
told us that the response to the June 2003 Bingol earthquake 
showed that the response situation had improved considerably 
in the last five years, but added that mitigation efforts 
were few and unorganized.  Nasuh Mahruki, Chairman of AKUT (a 
search-and-rescue NGO that achieved national fame for their 
work after the 1999 Izmit earthquake), sardonically confirmed 
to us that the city and other organizations seem to have 
focused on the \"glamorous\" response preparations at the 
expense of the more important preventive mitigation efforts. 
Another earthquake engineer living in Bursa noted a similar 
tendency on the part of municipal authorities there.  Even 
response preparedness has focused disproportionately on 
\"heavy\" search and rescue (using machinery to save people in 
collapsed buildings) instead of \"light\" search and rescue 
(where neighbors and local communities pull victims from 
rubble), which typically accounts for 80 percent of those 
rescued. 
 
 
6. (U) BUILDING CODES, TESTING, INSURANCE: Ironically, Turkey 
adopted modern building codes (judged to have up-to-date 
seismic design provisions by the USGS) shortly before the 
devastating Izmit earthquake.  The new code, the product of 
five years of work by expert commissions, was prompted by the 
1992 Erzincan earthquake and largely tracked advances in U.S. 
codes.  Aydinoglu, who was also the primary author of the new 
code, told us that he is primarily concerned with his failure 
since the 1980s to get Turkey to strengthen the legislation 
regarding testing and enforcement of building codes. 
Currently, the professional qualification requirements for 
those testing designs and examining buildings are extremely 
low.  An independent earthquake engineer told us separately 
that the software that is used by architects to design 
earthquake-resistant buildings is outdated and that engineers 
testing the designs on behalf of the authorities use the same 
software.  Although earthquake insurance is mandatory, only 
25 percent of buildings are believed to be insured and 
insurance companies have yet to develop any expertise or 
experience examining buildings. 
 
 
7. (U) UNCHECKED AND UNPLANNED GROWTH: Despite the persistent 
problems in design, however, the biggest problems for 
municipal authorities are caused by poor land-use planning 
and inferior construction.  Both problems have been 
exacerbated by the massive and largely uncontrolled waves of 
rural-to-urban migration that have made Istanbul Europe\'s 
largest city at approximately 12 million people.  Municipal 
authorities have been unable to cope with the flood of 
immigrants, many of whom began their new lives in Istanbul 
building unlicensed squatter (gecekondu, literally \"landed by 
night\") settlements, often in \"forest\" or \"state\" lands. 
Although a series of property amnesties has legalized many of 
these buildings and neighborhoods, between 60 to 65 percent 
of Istanbul\'s 1 million or so buildings were built without 
proper construction permits (i.e., not according to the 
approved plan or without a permit altogether).  Government 
plans for yet another property amnesty could spur another 
wave of illegal construction and vastly complicate municipal 
efforts to prepare for an earthquake (see septel) (Embassy 
Comment: At the same time, these plans may be driven by solid 
political reasons. End Comment). 
 
 
8. (U) EARTHQUAKE VULNERABILITY: One of the major challenges 
in Istanbul relates to the construction style and lack of 
building expertise.  Due to the ready availability of 
affordable wood, most residences in California are built on 
wooden frames, making them more ductile and 
earthquake-resistant (although they are also more susceptible 
to fires).  Due to a scarcity of wood, most Turkish 
residences are built on relatively more static reinforced 
concrete frames.  Furthermore, a lack of knowledge and 
expertise regarding the proper use of transverse bars, 
correctly-mixed concrete, and techniques to minimize moisture 
and corrosion have made many of these structures 
fundamentally unsound.  These simple problems have greatly 
increased Turkey\'s vulnerability to earthquake damage. 
Statistics from the losses in past earthquakes indicate that 
for every life lost in California, 10 are lost in similar 
earthquakes in Japan, and 100 in Turkey. 
 
 
9. (U) CROOKED CONTRACTORS AND DEATH-BY-\"PANCAKE\": Endemic 
corruption on the part of both building contractors and 
municipal authorities has given rise to thousands of 
sub-standard buildings that could become literal \"death 
traps\" in the event of a major earthquake.  According to one 
expert, authorities simply are not sufficiently well trained 
and paid to be able to resist corruption and properly enforce 
building codes.  The most common pattern of residential 
construction has been for self-financing contractors to 
conclude deals with land owners for permission to build in 
return for handing over a specified number of the future 
building\'s apartments.  With municipal authorities already on 
the take to overlook the illegal construction, the 
contractors have little incentive to comply with costly 
building codes.  Instead, they cut corners, using inferior 
materials and adding on unstable floors, to increase their 
overall profits.  It is these reinforced concrete, 4- to 
10-story, static or non-ductile apartment buildings that are 
at the greatest risk of damage or even \"pancake\"-style 
collapse that has claimed the most lives in previous 
earthquakes.  Studies predict that a major earthquake in 
Istanbul could result in between 5,000 and 6,000 such 
pancaked buildings. 
 
 
10. (U) PUBLIC FACILITIES: In the event of an earthquake, the 
safety of schools, hospitals, and other government buildings 
will be critical to minimizing damages and coordinating 
assistance.  These facilities, too, have yet to be thoroughly 
examined and reinforced.  One World Bank-funded study 
examined 26 hospitals and determined that 86 percent of them 
needed major repairs and reinforcements.  The former Director 
of the Kandilli Observatory and the then-Minister of Health 
got into a nasty public quarrel over the failure to follow 
through on the needed repairs.  The Ministry of Education 
inspected the local schools, evacuated a few of the most 
unsafe, and is engaged in reinforcing many others.  An 
official from a major teachers\' union told us, however, that 
the examinations were cursory at best.  Some cultural 
heritage sites and museums have also begun to prepare for an 
earthquake, but there is very little public funding available 
for this work.  The director of Topkapi Palace, for example, 
has obtained corporate sponsorship and has implemented a 
program, but the Hagia Sophia (which is expected to suffer 
serious damage in a major earthquake) has yet to do more than 
study the issue. 
 
 
Mitigation: Step By Small Step... 
--------------------------------- 
11. (U) Despite the challenges, in addition to the 
considerable work and organization that has been done on 
disaster response preparations, municipal authorities have 
also taken early steps to launch more comprehensive 
mitigation programs.  After overcoming obstacles and delays 
imposed by state authorities, the city conducted a loss 
estimation study and a geological survey with Japanese 
assistance to identify the areas and neighborhoods in 
Istanbul that are at greatest risk in an earthquake.  A 
consortium of universities, including Bogazici, Istanbul 
Technical, Yilidiz Technical, and Middle East Technical 
Universities, is set to complete a major study of economic, 
legal, technical, and sociological factors to determine the 
outlines for a mitigation project that will put all of 
Istanbul\'s buildings through a screening process to identify 
those that are at highest risk.  Istanbul officials estimate 
that the process will take about 10 years and cost as much as 
USD 10 billion.  A pilot project is due to begin shortly in 
the Zeytinburnu district of Istanbul.  Separately, a contract 
has also been awarded for retrofitting Istanbul\'s bridges. 
Perhaps the most encouraging steps with regard to mitigation 
have been taken by individuals sensitized to the dangers by 
recent earthquakes.  Although municipal authorities are still 
powerless to strictly enforce land-use plans and building 
codes, several earthquake experts have noted that individual 
land-owners and contractors are much less likely now to build 
in unsafe neighborhoods or to cut corners in construction. 
 
 
Much Left to Do.... 
------------------- 
12. (U) Although much of what remains to be done will take 
time and resources, there is also much that can be done at 
relatively low cost.  The American head of a 3-year old 
USAID/OFDA disaster awareness project believes that one of 
the key issues is to educate renters, property owners, and 
builders on how to construct earthquake-safe buildings. 
Simple measures and techniques that cost no more than 10 
percent of the construction cost could make new buildings 
much safer.  Another potentially productive area of education 
is non-structural mitigation efforts (properly fastening 
shelves and objects within buildings).  Fifty percent of 
earthquake injuries and 10 percent of deaths are attributable 
to non-structural causes.  The USAID/OFDA project (with only 
USD 530,000) has implemented a sustainable basic disaster 
awareness program for teachers and students, but has been 
unable to fully address these other critical education and 
awareness problems. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
13. (U) Because of the terrifying enormity of its scale and 
cost, preparing for a major earthquake is the proverbial 
elephant in the room that nobody in Istanbul really wants to 
talk about.  While the city does seem to have finally 
acknowledged its presence, the bulk of its early efforts have 
focused on the relatively easier and more glamorous task of 
response preparations instead of the more difficult and 
costly mitigation efforts.  Bottom line: Istanbul remains 
woefully unprepared for an earthquake.  Inshallah (God 
Willing), there will be enough time to advance major 
mitigation and educational efforts before the big one hits.

SUBJECT: OLYMPIC GAMES: ISTANBUL 2012? 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: On June 15, Istanbul formally submitted its 
application to the International Olympic Committee to host 
the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.  8 other cities had also 
thrown their hats into the ring: London, Paris, New York, 
Madrid, Moscow, Leipzig, Havana, and Rio de Janeiro.  Despite 
the fierce competition and continuing friction with the 
Istanbul municipality, Istanbul Olympic officials believe 
that their 2012 bid (their fourth consecutive application) is 
their strongest to date and that Istanbul has a good chance 
to be chosen as one of the finalists. End Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) ALWAYS A RUNNER-UP?  Despite having lost bids to host 
the 2000, 2004, and 2008 games, Istanbul Olympic officials 
are optimistic about their prospects for hosting the 2012 
Summer Olympic Games.  Like other would-be Olympic hosts, 
Istanbul faced serious problems in its earlier bids regarding 
the lack of sufficient venues and experience hosting 
international competitions.  Although Istanbul was chosen as 
a finalist in 2008, Istanbul Olympic officials believe that 
political considerations made Beijing the odds-on favorite 
(in addition to the fact that the 2004 games would be in 
nearby Athens).  This time, however, Istanbul Olympic 
officials are hopeful that their bid will be one of the 
strongest. 
 
 
3. (U) THE MEETING OF CONTINENTS: Yalcin Aksoy, the General 
Director of the Preparation and Organization Council for the 
Istanbul Olympic Games, told us that Istanbul has two main 
advantages in its favor.  First, Istanbul is not merely a 
geographic link between Europe and Asia: historically, 
culturally, and ethnically it brings much of the world 
together.  The Council plays to this advantage with its 
slogan, \"Istanbul: The Meeting of Continents.\"  Aksoy also 
noted that no Olympic games have ever been hosted by a 
predominantly Muslim city. 
 
 
4. (U) THE TURKISH OLYMPIC ACT: Next, Istanbul Olympic 
officials have a unique legislative instrument, the Turkish 
Olympic Act of May 1992, that guarantees the political 
support and resources needed to prepare for the Olympic 
Games.  Specifically, the Act (approved unanimously by the 
Turkish Parliament) provided for the creation of a permanent 
organization and staff to manage Istanbul\'s bids for the 
games.  Additionally, the Act devotes specific sources of 
revenue, including 5 percent of National Lottery proceeds and 
one percent shares of the Sports Lottery, horse-race betting 
ticket sales, and Istanbul Greater Municipality budget 
(totaling about USD 15-20 million each year). 
 
 
4. (U) WHITE ELEPHANTS?  As a result of this permanent staff 
(which Aksoy claimed is unique among cities bidding to host 
the Summer Games) and its financial resources, Istanbul has 
been able to overcome some of the problems it had with its 
early bids.  According to Aksoy, at the time of its first 
Olympic bid, Istanbul had only one of the 33 sports 
installations required to host the Summer Games.  Since then 
the Council has spent almost USD 200 million on 
installations, including an 80,000-seat Olympic stadium 
(costing USD 120 million), an Olympic Natatorium, and a 
20,000-seat gymnasium.  Plans are proceeding for an 
exhibition center and an Olympic Village.  The Council has 
also worked with local sports organizations to develop 
experience in hosting international events, including recent 
European diving and basketball championships.  Aksoy argued 
that given Istanbul\'s size and the local demand for sport, 
these venues will not be unused \"white elephants.\"  Istanbul 
will not build baseball stadiums or field hockey pitches 
until it wins its bid for the games, Aksoy said. 
 
 
5. (U) TRANSPORTATION WOES AND THE CURSE OF OBSCURITY: 
Istanbul\'s main disadvantage is its weak transportation 
infrastructure and chronic traffic problems.  The city\'s 
unsuccessful efforts to develop transportation networks to 
service the rapidly growing population would be a major 
problem in hosting an event as large as the Olympic Summer 
Games.  Additionally, unlike London, Paris, and New York, 
Istanbul is not as well known among the members of the 
International Olympic Committee (IOC).  But new restrictions 
imposed after the Salt Lake City scandals that prohibit IOC 
members from visiting competing cities virtually guarantees 
that most IOC members will have to vote on Istanbul\'s bid 
without really knowing the city.  Aksoy worries that their 
unfamiliarity and misguided impressions may imperil 
Istanbul\'s Olympic aspirations. 
 
 
6. (SBU) FRICTION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNCIL: Another 
disadvantage, largely downplayed by Aksoy, is the friction 
between the Preparation and Organization Council and the 
Istanbul Greater Municipality.  Although the Istanbul Mayor 
is one of the 13 Board Members of the Council, the 
legislative requirement that the city hand over one percent 
of its budget to the Council has generated significant 
tensions.  Much of the recent tension has focused on the 
issue of transportation.  Aksoy admitted that the Olympic 
Stadium\'s debut event last summer (a soccer match between 
former UEFA and perennial Turkish Champions Galatasaray and 
Greece\'s Olympiakos) was a \"catastrophe\" due to the lack of 
sufficient roads (Note: Local newspapers and soccer fans 
described the traffic into and out of the stadium as worse 
than Dante\'s Inferno).  Due to the city\'s refusal to build 
new roads and despite the fact that the Council\'s revenues 
are not supposed to be used for transportation 
infrastructure, the Council finally agreed last month to let 
the city use a portion of its annual dues to finish the USD 
10 million stadium access roads (just in time for Galatasaray 
to use the stadium for the 2003-2004 season while their own 
stadium is renovated).

2. (U) Summary:  Two new national surveys of Turkish 
companies highlight signs of recovery from the devastating 
financial crisis of 2001.  The studies, carried out 
separately by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO) and the 
Islamic-influenced Independent Industrialists\' and 
Businessmen\'s Association (MUSIAD), show a modest recovery, 
led largely by growth in exports.  ISO Chairman Tanil Kucuk 
stressed in announcing his organization\'s survey of the 
country\'s top 500 industrial companies that Turkey has 
benefited from booming exports but has much work to do to 
achieve \"sustainable\" economic growth. Though the study 
showed that Turkish industry returned to profitability in 
2002, he warned that recent headline growth figures in GNP 
(at 7.8 percent for 2002 and 8.1 percent in this year\'s first 
quarter) exaggerate the economy\'s strength and are \"too good 
to be true.\"  End Summary. 
 
 
----------------------- 
Turkey\'s Industrial 500 
----------------------- 
 
 
3. (U) Return to Profitability: The annual ISO study provides 
an authoritative snapshot of Turkish industry.  Overall, the 
industrial sector\'s share in GNP increased to 25.6 percent in 
2002 from 23 percent the previous two years, with the top 500 
companies accounting for 53.9 percent of that total (13.2 
percent of GNP).  Sales of the top 500 companies grew 5.8 
percent in real terms over 2001, with four-fifths of the 
companies registering a profit for the year, for an overall 
profit level of 5.7 percent (versus a 0.5 percent loss for 
the 500 companies in 2001).  Sales and profits were largely 
export driven, with the 500 achieving a 17.3 percent increase 
in exports, for a total of 17.3 billion USD, 49.5 percent of 
the country\'s total exports.  Other key factors in increasing 
profitability were decreasing labor costs (which took only 27 
percent of sales revenue in 2002, versus 34 percent in 2001), 
lower interest rates, and decreasing rent.  While the ratio 
of \"other revenues\" (interest earnings, real estate sales, 
and earnings from foreign currency exchange) over earnings 
from core operational activities was 114 percent in 2002 (it 
has been over 100 percent since 1999), it declined 
significantly from its level of 547 percent in 2001.  The 
decline reflects a significant shift by firms back towards 
their core activities, a trend that should be reinforced in 
coming years if real interest rates and inflation continue to 
decline. 
 
 
4. (U) Public vs. Private: The survey also provides a useful 
breakdown of state ownership in the industrial sector.  While 
Turkey\'s two largest industrial concerns, the state refinery 
Tupras (slated for privatization this year) and Electricity 
Production Ltd. (EUAS) are state-owned (with sales quadruple 
and double the next largest companies, respectively), overall 
only 30 of the top 500 companies are in the state\'s hands. 
While private sector exports boomed in 2002, public sector 
industrial exports dropped from 1.2 billion USD to 972 
million USD.  Employment figures show that the IMF program is 
having an effect: the three largest employers on the list 
(TEKEL, Turkish Sugar Factories, and the Turkish Coal Mining 
Companies) are state owned, but overall employment in public 
sector companies fell 21.86 percent from 178,005 to 139,102. 
Private sector industrial employment rose 5 percent to 
365,694.  The increased efficiencies resulting from the cuts 
brought an impressive turnaround in profitability for public 
sector companies, from negative 6.1 percent to plus 8.3 
percent.  Private companies also saw increasing 
profitability, though the rise was more modest, with 
profitability reaching 5.1 percent in 2002 from 1.3 percent 
in 2001. 
 
 
5. (U) Winners: Koc Holding remains Turkey\'s largest private 
industrial group, with 19 companies in the top 500, and five 
in the top 10 private companies.  Koc leads in all areas, 
including total sales, profits, exports, and employment. 
With group sales of 4.85 billion USD, the holding accounted 
for 9 percent of total sales and 11 percent of total private 
sector sales among the top 500.  The country\'s second largest 
holding, the Sabanci group, has 15 companies in the top 500, 
but in a reflection of its increasing orientation towards 
financial services, has no companies in the top 10 private 
companies for either overall sales, exports, or profits. 
 
 
6. (U) Words of Warning: In his public comments announcing 
the survey results, ISO President Tanil Kucuk noted that 
conditions are generally improving, but stressed that 
headline growth figures (7.8 percent in 2002 and 8.1 percent 
in this year\'s first quarter) are \"too good to be true,\" and 
will not be sustainable until fundamental changes occur in 
the economy.  He echoed points he has made frequently to us 
in recent meetings about the difficulties facing Turkish 
companies, including the unavailability of affordable credit, 
which requires companies to finance investments from their 
own resources, the high cost of energy and other inputs, and 
high tax and social security payments on wages, including 
particularly the increasing weight of indirect taxes (which 
now account for 70 percent of all tax revenues).  Action is 
needed, he stressed, to expand Turkey\'s tax base and thereby 
reduce the size of the shadow economy and the unfair 
competition it represesents. 
 
 
------------- 
MUSIAD Survey 
------------- 
 
 
7. (U) Improving Morale: The MUSIAD survey, carried out in 27 
provinces with participation by 1800 companies, showed a 
similar improvement in morale, while also highlighting the 
challenges on the horizon.   50 percent of the companies 
surveyed increased production in the first half of 2003, 54 
percent experienced an increase in domestic sales, 58 percent 
saw an increase in exports, and 45 percent increased their 
workforce.  Profitability presented a more mixed picture, 
however, with 36 percent seeing increased profits, 29 percent 
seeing no change, and 35 percent suffering a drop in 
profitability.  Expectations for the second half of the year 
were more positive, with predictions for increases outpacing 
first half results for sales (61 percent), exports (76 
percent) and employment (57 percent).  One-third of 
respondents noted that they operate at 70-80 percent of 
capacity, with 22 percent utilizing 60-70 percent, and 
another 22 percent utilizing less than half. 
 
 
8. (U) Continuing Challenges: The MUSIAD survey highlights 
the fact that even small companies are heavily dependent on 
exports, with 58 percent of respondents exporting 61-80 
percent of their production, and 9 percent exporting 
virtually everything they produce.  Exports continue despite 
the appreciating Turkish lira, but many respondents warned 
that the profit margin on exports is becoming dangerously 
low.  The survey also highlighted the continuing financing 
problems facing Turkish industry, with general reluctance 
(and inability) to use outside funding sources forcing 
two-third\'s of respondents to utilize their own equity to 
continue their operations.  Only 21 percent utilized bank 
loans. 
 
 
9. (U) MUSIAD Chairman Ali Bayramoglu suggested that 
increasing growth and declining inflation show that the 
wounds of 2001 are gradually healing.  He argued that 
business confidence in the government is increasing, but 
pressed for action to reduce the domestic borrowing 
requirement of the government and to bring Turkey\'s widening 
current account deficit under control.  If action is not 
speedily taken on these issues, he warned, including through 
a \"controlled flexible currency policy,\" Turkey faces a 
possible crisis in the fall. 
 
 
10. (SBU) Comment: The MUSIAD and ISO studies confirm what we 
are hearing anecdotally from other contacts here in Istanbul: 
the real economy has improved over the past year and a half, 
but remains fragile, and sensitive to macroeconomic shocks. 
Most concur that headline growth figures exaggerate the 
extent of improvement in the economy, and that the important 
motor of domestic demand has only improved marginally over 
the past year.  Given the critical problem of financing, 
which hampers almost all Turkish companies, most business 
groups remain strong backers of Turkey\'s economic reform 
program, hoping that by reducing inflation and changing the 
country\'s risk profile real interest rates can be brought to 
a more business-friendly level.  MUSIAD, long a strong critic 
of the program, remains the only significant exception to 
that rule.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL ECONOMISTS CHEER RECENT GOOD NEWS, BUT 
REMAIN WARY 
 
 
1.  Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet 
distribution. 
 
 
2.(SBU) Summary: Istanbul market analysts are pleasantly 
surprised by recent positive developments in the economy, and 
accept the rationale for the IMF\'s preemptive decision to 
reschedule much of Turkey\'s 2004 and 2005 debt repayments. 
They warn, however, that the government will have to use the 
current opportunity to best advantage, and that much of the 
recent good news (including on the inflation front) is 
dependent on the strong Turkish lira, which may begin to give 
back its gains in early fall.  The market, they suggest, will 
continue to take its cues from Turkish-IMF relations, and 
from developments relating to promised U.S. assistance.  Some 
argue disbursement of the latter\'s initial tranche itself 
could bring interest rates down 2-3 percent.  End Summary. 
 
 
3.(SBU) Good News: A range of senior bankers and market 
analysts told Pol/Econ Chief and visiting Ankara Deputy Econ 
Counselor on August 12 that they are relatively optimistic 
about the Turkish economy for the short term, given recent 
positive developments, including good inflation, industrial 
production, and export figures, and most significantly the 
IMF\'s decision to defer repayments of 2004 and 2005 debt. 
They noted that the timing of the rescheduling had surprised 
the market, though most believed it was unavoidable, given 
the volume of debt coming due, particularly in 2004.  In 
Bender Securities\' Murat Gulkan\'s view, the Fund made a 
virtue of necessity, making the move at a time when it would 
be welcomed by the market.  Had it occurred in the fall, he 
suggested, markets would have reacted negatively, viewing it 
as a sign of IMF weakness. 
 
 
4.(SBU) Lira Appreciation: Most analysts stress, however, 
that much of the recent good news, including especially the 
recent decline in inflation, is tied to the appreciation of 
the Turkish lira.  They suggest that the lira\'s strength may 
not persist beyond October, given seasonal factors, and warn 
too that its high level may also begin to negatively affect 
exports, which have played a key role in leading the recent 
recovery.  Our contacts had a variety of explanations for the 
lira\'s strength, but almost all now see money from Iraq 
playing a significant role.  Bender\'s Murat Gulkan and Emin 
Ozturk noted the recent disconnect between the foreign 
exchange and bondmaret, wththefomerriingstongy, 
wil inerst ates on bonds eclne ony odetl.  n 
thirvie--ecoed byYapi Kedi Bak conmit Hsa 
rsl--ony lira puchasesaimed rimariy at cnsumption or 
investments outsid the financial markets explain the 
discrepancy, since otherwise bond yields would have fallen as 
well.  Another factor in the discrepancy may also be the 
relative thinness of the foreign exchange market, a point 
cited by an Akbank executive in a recent meeting with the 
DCM.  Ersel posited that many ordinary Turks, having sharply 
curtailed consumption during the 2001 financial crisis, 
finally feel enough short-term confidence to spend more. 
Since their income has not increased, however, Ersel said 
they are dipping into their wealth in the form of foreign 
exchange holdings.  HC Istanbul Chief economist Banturalp 
Candemir credited promised U.S. assistance with calming the 
market and permitting the lira to appreciate, and predicted 
that actual loan disbursement would bring rates down another 
2-3 percent. 
 
 
5.(SBU) Future Steps: Candemir raised another cautionary note 
for next year, noting that two-thirds of the government\'s 
revenue measures this year have been \"one off.\"  Given that 
many have been amnesties which are relatively painless but 
which can only go so far, new more painful measures will be 
required next year for Turkey to maintain a strong primary 
surplus.  That will be tough for the government, he 
predicted, \"since they want to avoid hurting people,\" 
especially in an election year.  Bender\'s Gulkan and Ozturk 
agreed that the government\'s fiscal performance has been a 
problem, in that while \"good\" in Ozturk\'s view, it has not 
kept pace with the IMF program\'s \"extremely ambitious\" 
targets. 
 
 
6.(SBU) A Weak Banking Sector: Banking contacts also hailed 
the recent good news, but were less sanguine about the 
banking sector itself.  TEB CEO Akin Akbaygil identified the 
size of Turkey\'s banking sector as the key problem facing the 
country, arguing that the country\'s debt would be less of a 
problem if the sector were more developed.  Yapi Kredi Senior 
Vice President and Chief Economist Hasan Ersel concurred, 
noting that steps to increase bank capitalization last year 
had been a \"static solution to a dynamic problem.\"  Both 
expressed concern about the impact of the IMAR bank scandal 
on the BRSA, with Akbaygil predicting that the scandal\'s 
scope may ultimately eclipse that of the BCCI scandal.  He 
noted that banking regulators appear to have been fixated on 
simply confirming basic measures such as the bank\'s capital 
adequacy ratio, and were blind to the scope of the apparent 
fraud being carried out at the bank.  More generally, while 
conceding that the BRSA has done an enormous amount to clean 
up the sector, and \"surviving banks\" are appreciative of its 
efforts, problems remain, including lack of liquidity (too 
many bank assets are tied up in treasury paper, leaving the 
banks \"prisoners\" of the system).  Incentives remain skewed 
against conducting actual banking, however, as good profits 
are available only in buying and selling government paper. 
 
 
7.(SBU) Comment: Our contacts were more sanguine about 
prospects for the fall than they have been in the past, given 
the IMF\'s surprise decision, and concurred that it, together 
with promised U.S. assistance, could create a \"virtuous 
circle\" that brings down interest rates and lessens the 
financing burden on the Treasury.  They warned of the extreme 
fragility of this scenario, however.  Candemir noted that AK 
Party officials are convinced that their successful policies 
brought down interest rates.  In his view, however, the rate 
decline is not a success story, in that it could have been 
even more dramatic if the IMF review process had not been so 
drawn out.  End comment.

1.  (U) Summary: The Republican People\'s Party\'s August 3 
Istanbul congress showcased a spirited contest between 
supporters of party leader Deniz Baykal and opposition 
groups within the party.  When the votes were counted, 
Baykal\'s candidate, Sinasi Oktem, won easily, but a brawl on 
the congress floor highlighted divisions in the party.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
------------- 
Baykal Speaks 
------------- 
 
 
2.  (U) CHP party leader Deniz Baykal won only lukewarm 
applause when he entered the hall, a reaction that turned to 
sarcastic grins and angry interruptions as many delegates 
responded negatively to his speech.  Most reactions came 
when Baykal claimed the party had ended its fractional 
\"schisms\" and \"internal conflicts.\" A number of delegates 
told PolOfficer that the party administration had dismissed 
many members and brought in new ones with \"arbitrary\" and 
\"unlawful\" decisions.  Not holding primaries before the 
general elections in November was another reason why Baykal 
opponents were unhappy with the party. 
 
 
------------- 
Tensions Rise 
------------- 
 
 
3.  (U) After Baykal\'s speech, when party delegates were 
given the chance to speak, tensions between the opposition 
and Baykal supporters started to rise, reaching a peak when 
some of the party officials proposed ending deliberations 
early. This caused an uproar and ended in fisticuffs, 
leading to one injury. 
 
 
4.  (U) Late in the afternoon, the three candidates for 
Istanbul chairman made their speeches.  Mehmet Boluk, a 
former chairman, and Batur Ilter criticized the party 
administration for its \"anti-democratic\" decisions. Both 
candidates complained about the party\'s \"move towards the 
right,\" and demanded a more left-wing message to cull the 
votes of the poor. The two candidates\' protests were 
disputed by the third, Sinasi Oktem, who praised the party\'s 
performance and policies. After his speech, Batur Ilter 
announced that he was withdrawing his candidacy, leaving 
only the opposition candidate, Mehmet Boluk, and the current 
chairman, Sinasi Oktem. The latter was elected with 409 
votes. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
5.  (U) Although Oktem won the election with an overwhelming 
majority, the congress was a clear manifestation of the 
divide within the party between pro- and anti-Baykal forces. 
Despite a considerable number of members and delegates who 
are unhappy with the party\'s policies and the decisions made 
by the party leadership, Baykal seems to have managed to 
hang on to control in Istanbul. With a loyalist district 
chairman and support from most of the 140 newly-elected 
delegates that Istanbul will send to the party\'s national 
congress, Baykal enhanced his prospects for keeping dissent 
in check at that event as well.

SUBJECT: ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH (FINALLY) MEETS WITH AKP 
MINISTERS 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David L. Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and ( 
 
 
d). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I met with 
FonMin Abdullah Gul and IntMin Abdulkadir Aksu on August 8 
and 12, respectively.  Though both ministers publicly and 
warmly received Bartholomew, the meetings did not yield any 
concrete steps forward on property issues or recognition of 
the Patriarch\'s ecumenical status.  Much ground remains to be 
covered in resolving property and recognition problems.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
 
Bartholomew meets with Gul 
-------------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) The Ecumenical Patriarchate requested formal meetings 
with the new government months ago, but Bartholomew was only 
received on August 8 by FonMin Abdullah Gul and on August 12 
by IntMin Abdulkadir Aksu (note: this meeting follows a 
personal appeal by Greek FonMin Papandreou during a recent 
visit to Istanbul).  Metropolitan Meliton of Philadelphia, 
who attended the meetings with Gul and with Aksu, reported 
that Gul warmly received the Patriarch, who made a brief 
presentation about the activities of the Patriarchate both 
within Turkey and internationally.  Bartholomew then 
discussed the many property issues which have been 
problematic for the Greek community and Patriarchate for many 
years.  Per Meliton, Gul professed surprise at the extent to 
which the General Directorate for Foundations had caused the 
Patriarchate problems, and requested further information on 
the Patriarchate\'s complaints.  After further legal 
explanation by Keban Hatemi, attorney for the Patriarchate 
who was also in attendance, Gul said that the AK government 
is working on new policies and regulations intended to make 
improvements in religious freedom in Turkey, for Muslims and 
all believers.  At the conclusion of the meeting, Gul 
reiterated to reporters that he had promised to continue 
working with the Patriarchate on property issues, including 
re-opening the Halki Seminary. 
 
 
Aksu Blames the State 
--------------------- 
 
 
3. (C) Like Gul, Aksu voiced a willingness to work with the 
Patriarchate and a recognition of past injustices to the 
religious minorities.  Meliton reported that Aksu said past 
problems were the result of \"a consolidated state policy,\" 
and hoped that \"in time healthier conditions will be formed 
to solve these problems.\"  Aksu, per Meliton, said that past 
judicial decisions against minority foundations \"are not 
befitting of democratic institutions.\" 
 
 
No \'Ecumenical\' For a While 
--------------------------- 
 
 
4. (C) Meliton said that, in a brief interchange, Gul asked 
the Patriarch to continue supporting Turkey in the public 
sphere, as the current climate was difficult for Turkey.  Per 
Meliton, the Patriarch said that as a Turkish citizen, he had 
always voiced strong support for Turkey in national and 
international settings.  However, he had also been honest 
about the problems (property issues and ecumenical status) he 
encounters.  Gul, and later Aksu, both made a request that 
the Patriarch not use the title Ecumenical until January, 
2004.  Aksu said that the reason for this was that PM Erdogan 
was planning to attend a meeting in Istanbul of the European 
Popular Party in October of this year, (a conference the 
Patriarch typically participates in), but would be unable if 
conference materials used the Ecumenical title. 
 
 
5. (C) Per Meliton, the Patriarch told Gul that he could not 
disavow the ecumenical status of the Patriarch, which had 
been recognized since the 6th century, but that he would, as 
a show of good faith, ask that the title not be printed in 
conference materials.  However, Bartholomew said, he could 
not prevent other conference attendees from using the title 
in referring to him.  Meliton said that Gul was not very 
happy with this response.  Meliton also noted that Gul said 
two FonMin ambassadors might be sent to the conference in 
Erdogan\'s place. 
 
 
Media Reaction 
-------------- 
 
 
6. (C) Extensive press coverage and commentary, particularly 
following the Gul meeting, focused primarily on the possible 
opening of the Halki Seminary.  The more right-wing 
nationalist press greeted the prospect with predictable 
paranoid hostility while some of the liberal columnists 
magnanimously welcomed the idea.  The Islamist press, 
meanwhile, was also warm to the idea, while the die-hard 
secularist writers openly warned that AK and its Islamist 
supporters sought only to use Halki to establish a precedent 
for loosening state control of Islamic education and training. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
7. (C) Despite the delay in receiving Bartholomew, these 
meetings may be a positive sign that the new government, as 
it moves aggressively to advance EU harmonization reforms, 
will also take further steps to improve the situation of 
Turkey\'s religious minority communities.  Even assuming the 
government is well-intentioned, however (and does not intend 
to use the minorities as a foil for a separate Islamic 
agenda), addressing the difficult property and religious 
freedom issues and pressing the state bureaucracy to change 
its behavior will be a long, uphill struggle.

REF: ISTANBUL 1039 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: A property amnesty currently being planned 
by the Justice and Development (AK) Party government has set 
off a flurry of debate and criticism in Istanbul.  AK sees 
the measure as a potential major source of revenue, a 
realistic solution to a long-ignored problem (i.e., \"illegal\" 
settlements and the political and social limbo squatters live 
under), and a popular pre-local election vote-getter in the 
poor and disenfranchised voter base of Istanbul\'s crowded 
urban sprawl.  Opponents in Istanbul charge, however, that 
what they dismiss as a populist measure will undermine what 
they allege are existing sensible land-use, environmental, 
and disaster-mitigation policies and encourage illegal 
land-grabs and construction.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Having wiped out the detailed Ottoman land registry 
system, the Republic of Turkey has never carried out a 
systematic survey or introduced a new and complete land 
registry system.  Nor has the Turkish state controlled the 
use of state-owned lands or enforced zoning laws.  With this 
lack of control, and under succeeding national and local 
governments of all political stripes -- including CHP -- 
squatter communities, including some of the most stable 
neighborhoods in Turkey\'s largest cities, have mushroomed 
since the 1960\'s, with periodic commitments by local 
governments to supply utilities and paved roads on a catch-up 
basis.  The provision of utilities in turn has spurred 
developers to offer squatters free apartments in return for 
letting them consolidate squatter plots and build apartment 
blocks. 
 
 
3. (SBU) In this context, the Justice and Development (AK) 
Party government is planning a property amnesty as a means to 
generate revenue and regularize the quasi-legal resident 
status of hundreds of thousands of migrants to Turkey\'s major 
cities.  The impact of such an amnesty would be felt 
particularly in Istanbul where approximately 700,000 
buildings, or 60-65 percent of the total, are believed to be 
illegally constructed (i.e., without proper building 
permits), with many of them built on state lands (i.e., 
without deeds).  In addition to new laws and regulations, a 
comprehensive amnesty will require a constitutional amendment 
(which could eventually go to a national referendum) to 
enable the government to reclassify some \"forest lands\" which 
have long been built on or used as agricultural land. (Note: 
Currently the proposal would cover only lands which had been 
converted by 1981, but it is unclear how all such 
determinations could be accurately documented.  End Note.)

4. (SBU) The history of property amnesties in Turkey has 
paralleled (and, some believe, contributed to) the massive 
waves of rural-to-urban migration over the last five decades. 
 Since the first amnesty in 1949, there have been six more 
culminating in the most recent one in 1986.  In the early 
years, the unavailability and/or inaffordability of proper 
housing forced newly-arrived migrants to construct their own 
\"gecekondu,\" or squatter residences, recreating their village 
lifestyle in the greater Istanbul region.  Although built on 
state property and without the requisite building permits, 
both industry and politicians benefited, tapping the 
settlements for cheap labor and votes.  As such, the early 
amnesties that allowed gecekondu owners to \"purchase\" permits 
and legal titles to their property were win-win propositions 
for the politicians: they were popular vote-getters that also 
generated extra revenue for the government coffers. 
 
 
5. (SBU) In the 1980s and 1990s, Istanbul grew to become 
Europe\'s most populous city and was increasingly unable to 
absorb and manage the massive population influx, reaching as 
high as 500,000 migrants each year.  With time, the clear-cut 
populist equation of property amnesties became murkier.  Land 
speculators and corner-cutting contractors built sub-standard 
multi-story apartment buildings to rent out to poorer 
families, making money on the ever-increasing demand for 
housing and gambling on the expectation that future 
governments would legalize their properties.  More and more 
people objected to new amnesties as \"unfair\" (i.e., they 
provided legal cover to law-breakers) and municipal 
authorities in more affluent areas became increasingly 
frustrated with the negative effect they had on their 
attempts to conduct sensible urban planning and management. 
Amnesties aside, however, politicians and bureaucrats 
continued to profit from the fresh supply of potential voters 
and the endemic corruption involved in turning a blind eye to 
new, illegal properties. 
 
 
------------ 
AK\'s Amnesty 
------------ 
6. (SBU) A chronic lack of comprehensive urban land-use 
planning in the last several decades has left the current AK 
government with an untenable situation in which hundreds of 
thousands of city-dwellers live in quasi-legal or illegal 
residences.  Thousands of acres of so-called \"forest lands\" 
in and around the cities have long been cleared and developed 
to accommodate rural migrants or wealthy city apartment 
dwellers in search of homes with gardens.  Even the 
opposition CHP party campaigned last year with a pledge to 
transfer such lands to the current residents.  AKP, however, 
has emphasized the revenue-generating potential of a new 
property amnesty.  In discussing the issue, Prime Minister 
Erdogan has made repeated references to expected revenues, a 
figure that some government officials put as high as USD 25 
billion.  Some we have talked to, however, note that 
amnesties never generate the revenue anticipated and have 
labeled the latest proposal as merely another in a long 
series of amnesties that will reward supporters and win 
votes: 
 
 
-- Eyup Muhcu, Chairman of the Istanbul Chamber of 
Architects, railed against the proposed amnesty, calling it a 
blatant attempt to make money and win votes that violates 
most people\'s \"sense of justice,\" encourages more illegal 
construction, and complicates efforts to prepare for a major 
earthquake (reftel). 
 
 
-- Selami Ozturk, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) Mayor 
of Kadikoy (where approximately 1 million Istanbul residents 
live), told poloff that a new amnesty would make it \"nearly 
impossible\" for him to provide municipal services to 
gecekondu neighborhoods that developed without any urban 
planning or oversight.  Moreover, pointing to detailed 
neighborhood maps overlaid with the 2002 voting results, 
Ozturk noted how the amnesty would primarily benefit those 
neighborhoods that had voted heavily for the AK Party. 
 
 
-- While careful not to directly criticize the AK 
government\'s policies, Irfan Uzun, Head of the Planning and 
Property for the Istanbul Greater Municipality, told poloff 
that city land-use plans would be undermined if completely 
illegal buildings without deeds or permits are provided 
amnesty.  Uzun worried aloud that the city may have to \"buy 
back\" deeds awarded during an amnesty in order to expropriate 
and destroy properties that conflict with city infrastructure 
projects. 
 
 
7. (SBU) The proposed amnesty has its share of supporters: 
 
 
-- AKP founding member and independent businessman Cuneyt 
Zapsu defended the amnesty as sensible economic policy, 
arguing that the government must acknowledge the irreversible 
fact that many of these \"forest lands\" can not be restored 
and that thousands of illegal settlements can not be 
destroyed.  By legalizing these properties and \"bringing them 
into the system,\" the amnesty will not only generate revenue, 
but will also change now untransferrable assets into 
convertible ones, benefiting the economy as a whole. 
 
 
-- Yahya Karakaya, the Saadet Party mayor of Sultanbeyli 
listed the lack of legal property deeds as one of his 
district\'s major problems, arguing that even the residents of 
his poor district would be willing to purchase building 
permits and deeds to escape the constant threat of eviction. 
(Note: Approximately 75 percent of the buildings in 
Sultanbeyli lack permits and 25 percent are built on state 
lands and lack deeds.  End Note.) 
 
 
8. (SBU) Even opponents of a new amnesty conceded that 
certain strict conditions could theoretically minimize the 
negative effects of an amnesty: mandating basic building 
codes and safety standards, authorizing municipal authorities 
to retrofit neighborhoods for services, limiting the amnesty 
to owner/residents, and ensuring that this be the \"final\" 
amnesty.  Uzun from the Istanbul Greater Municipality claimed 
that most of the buildings without permits have only minor 
problems, but that an amnesty that allowed the city to 
examine and reissue permits to buildings with minor 
construction problems would actually be beneficial. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
Forest Lands and Forest Fires 
----------------------------- 
9. (SBU) Perhaps the most controversial part of the amnesty 
plan relates to a proposed constitutional amendment to 
reclassify a portion of the country\'s designated \"forest 
lands\" (those which lost their forest nature by 1981) to 
enable the government to sell off properties that have long 
since been illegally cleared and settled.  Although the first 
effort to pass such an amendment was vetoed by President 
Sezer earlier this year, the government is determined to push 
forward, even if it means risking the chance that the 
President will submit it to a national referendum (Note: The 
President has the authority to veto such bills only once.)  A 
rash of summer forest fires this year (summer forest fires 
have been a problem for at least a decade but the press 
reports a large increase last year) may be an indication that 
some unscrupulous speculators hoping to profit from newly 
\"cleared\" land expect the amendment and a broad amnesty to 
pass.  (Note: They would need to produce fake documentation 
to show that the lands had been deforested long before, or 
perhaps they see the proposed amnesty as the first in a new 
series of such amnesties.  End Note.) 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
9. (SBU) AK is motivated by an understanding that 
regularizing the status of people who now live in fear of 
constant eviction will win them votes and by wishful thinking 
that an amnesty will bring in substantial revenue.  Seeking 
to balance popular measures with the dictates of an IMF 
package, the government desperately needs the increased 
flexibility that any extra fiscal revenue will provide. 
This, combined with the fact that AK would benefit directly 
at the ballot box from a property amnesty, gives the 
government a powerful incentive to press forward with this 
proposal. 
 
 
10. (SBU) The impact on Istanbul from an urban planning 
perspective will likely be negative.  An amnesty without 
strict conditions (and past experience and realistic 
expectations suggest that such conditions are unlikely to be 
adopted) will complicate the city\'s efforts to prepare for an 
earthquake, provide municipal services, and plan for 
sustainable growth. 
 
 
11. (SBU) Although many in Istanbul are uninterested, or at 
least ambivalent, about the idea of a property amnesty, they 
would likely be more decisive if the \"forest land\" issue 
comes to a referendum.  Unaware of or despairing over the 
extent of deforestation in Istanbul, large numbers of voters 
living in the heart of the long built-up urban area would 
probably turn out in opposition, thereby setting the stage 
for a divisive vote that government critics will bill as a 
referendum on the AK government\'s overall performance.

SUBJECT: PM ERDOGAN CALLS FOR U.S. ACTION AGAINST PKK/KADEK 
 
 
Classified By: Acting Consul General Stuart Smith for reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: In a September 12 public speech, Prime 
Minister Tayyip Erdogan called for a leading U.N. role in 
Iraq, Turkish contributions to Iraq\'s stability and 
reconstruction, and U.S. action against PKK/KADEK.  Without 
attaching any specific pre-conditions, the PM said that 
Turkey is still considering whether to send troops to Iraq. 
End Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Speaking at a September 12 dinner hosted by the 
Turkish-American Business Association (a group that includes 
mostly Turkish businesses), Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan 
said that despite occasional disagreements, U.S.-Turkish 
relations are strong and broad-based.  Though anti-Turkish 
lobbies have worked in Washington to undermine these 
relations, he said, Turkey and the U.S. have had close 
political, economic, and security relations for decades and 
will continue to enjoy such relations. 
 
 
3. (U) On Iraq, Erdogan noted that the U.S. and Turkey share 
an interest in rebuilding a stable, democratic Iraq and that 
Turkey is already making contributions to that effort.  He 
argued that the United Nations should play a lead role in 
this project, and said that Turkey is still studying whether 
to send Turkish troops to participate in a stabilization 
force.  If necessary, the PM said he would send a bill to 
parliament for its consideration. 
 
 
4. (U) On terrorism, Erdogan criticized both the U.S. and the 
West for \"not taking the necessary attitude towards KADEK.\" 
While acknowledging the tragedy that occurred in the U.S. on 
9/11, Erdogan argued that Turkey has also been the victim of 
a terrorist campaign that claimed 40,000 lives.  The U.S. 
should act against PKK/KADEK in the same manner that they 
would expect Turkey to act against terrorists threatening the 
U.S.  If this is done, he added, everything will work out. 
 
 
5. (C) Comment: It appears that the PM may have departed from 
his prepared script during his remarks on terrorism and the 
PKK/KADEK.  Many of the 500-plus participants in the dinner 
(who included numerous Turkish businessmen and Turkish 
representatives of U.S. businesses) were taken aback at the 
\"harshness\" of his comments on that topic.  At the same time, 
they were impressed by Erdogan\'s grasp of the range of other 
issues in the relationship, as reflected not just in the 
speech but in comments to attendees during the hour plus he 
spent moving from table to table before departing.

REF: 02 ANKARA 7237 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet 
distribution. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Summary: While market attention is focused on IMF 
program implementation and the sustainability of Turkey\'s 
debt, joblessness and underemployment remain the key 
preoccupations of the bulk of the Turkish population.  2003\'s 
second quarter brought some improvement, according to 
official figures-- though these are distorted both by the 
scale of the informal economy and disguised unemployment in 
the agricultural sector-- with the unemployment rate 
declining from 12.3 to 10 percent.  But 2.4 million Turks are 
still officially listed as being unemployed, and most experts 
believe the true figure is far higher.  Recent studies by 
TUSIAD and the Turkish Employers Association (TISK) attribute 
continuing high unemployment to both supply and demand 
factors and warn that if the structural problems facing 
employment are not addressed, the country\'s unemployment rate 
could double by 2010. End Summary. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Labor Market Snapshot: New statistics from the State 
Statistics Institute show that at the end of the second 
quarter of 2003 there were 2.418 million unemployed workers 
in Turkey, while 21.6 million people were working in the 
labor force, translating to a 10 percent unemployment rate 
and a 49.4 percent labor force participation rate.  The 
figures represent a slight deterioration from second quarter 
figures in 2002, but an improvement from 2003\'s first 
quarter, when 2.84 million people were unemployed and the 
total employment figure was only 20.25 million, for a labor 
force participation rate of 47.5 percent.  Among educated 
young people, the rate is significantly worse, however, with 
25.9 percent unemployment.  The rate is particularly high for 
high school graduates, Galatasaray Professor Seyfatten Gursel 
argues, because shortcomings in the Turkish educational 
system leave students unprepared for the working world. 
While unemployment rates are lower for college graduates, the 
recent recession has impacted them as well.  Yilmaz Argudan, 
a leading management consultant, told us in a recent meeting 
that whereas his MBA students at Istanbul\'s elite Koc 
University each received an average of 3 or more good job 
offers in years past, now they are averaging less than one 
per student. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Underestimating the problem: Two key factors 
complicate any attempt to understand the scope of 
unemployment in Turkey: the fact that nearly 40 percent of 
the population remains engaged in agriculture, and secondly, 
the fact that 40 percent of all economic activity is 
unregistered.  Turkey\'s high level of agricultural employment 
masks the severity of the country\'s unemployment problem, in 
that agricultural \"employment\" for many is simply a disguised 
form of underemployment or unemployment, while the low 
official unemployment rate in agricultural brings the overall 
rate down.  Most analysts thus use the more meaningful 
non-agricultural unemployment rate, which more dramatically 
illustrates the impact of the 2001 crisis.  From an already 
high level of 9 percent in 2000, it jumped to over 16 percent 
in 2002, and has not improved significantly since. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Unregistered workers: The issue is further 
complicated, however, by the size of Turkey\'s unregistered 
economy, which a recent State Statistics Institute study 
suggests accounts for 40 percent of Turkey\'s gross domestic 
product.  That level is nearly twice as large proportionally 
as the unregistered economy\'s share of GDP in most developing 
economies.  Hence while 5.3 million workers are officially 
registered with Turkey\'s Social Security Fund (SSK), another 
3.4 million workers are not registered.  These workers fall 
outside of Turkey\'s social security net and receive no legal 
protection.  As Ankara Finance Ministry officials recently 
told the Embassy, the 2001 crisis reinforced this tendency. 
With few employment options, workers are willing to accept 
whatever employment they can get.  Tackling the unregistered 
economy is viewed by most economists as another key part of 
any permanent solution to the unemployment, since the forty 
percent of workers who fall outside the social security 
system not only do not contribute to it, but their firms 
compete \"unfairly\" with those who do.  Reduction of this 
shadow economy is another key goal of organizations like the 
Turkish Employers\' Association (TISK) and and the Turkish 
Ready-Wear Makers Association (TGSD). 
 
 
6. (SBU) Structural Problems: If the precise level of 
unemployment is difficult to assess, there is little 
disagreement about the poor record of the Turkish economy 
over the past decade in creating new jobs.  A recent report 
by TISK noted that between 1996 and 2002, while Turkey\'s 
population increased by eight million, overall employment 
fell by over 100,000 to 20.28 million people.  Most 
economists attribute this poor record to structural problems 
in the labor market, particularly high tax and social 
security rates.  Many argue Turkey\'s newly passed job 
security legislation, aimed at harmonizing Turkish standards 
with those of the E.U., will compound the problem. 
Industrialists in Bursa recently argued to us that the law\'s 
requirement that employers \"justify\" any lay-offs will in 
fact make them more hesitant to hire new workers.  The 
criticism led the government to delay implementation of the 
legislation and to try to make it more \"employer friendly\" by 
exempting firms employing less than 30 workers.  In a July 
letter to the government on unemployment, the Turkish 
Ready-wear Manufacturer\'s Association (TGSD) commented 
ironically that the harmonization effort to bring Turkey in 
line with Europe should not stop with employment standards, 
but should extend to tax rates as well.  The association 
pointed out that with recent increases, Turkey\'s total tax 
burden on wages is 47 percent, well above the OECD average of 
26 percent, and exceeding even the levels in Scandinavia. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Tax Incentives: TGSD\'s proposed solution, one echoed 
by many other organizations and economists, is to provide 
meaningful tax incentives for employers.  As additional 
workers are taken on, the organization suggests, tax and 
social security payments should increasingly be shared by the 
government, with the employer paying a lower rate.  In early 
August, Labor Minister Basesgioglu indicated that his 
Ministry was working with the Finance Ministry and Treasury 
to develop a program along these lines, under which 20 
percent of the social security tax and a similar percentage 
of the income tax for each new employee would be paid by the 
government. TGSD also proposed regional incentive programs, 
modelled on measures adopted to encourage economic 
development in Turkey\'s Southeast, however, the IMF opposes 
these geographic incentives, believing they lead to market 
distortions.  (Comment: In our view, Turkey tends to resort 
too often to tax incentives.  The solution to the high tax 
rate problem is for Turkey to continue to work with the IFIs 
on tax reform that broadens the tax base, enabling it over 
time to reduce marginal rates.  End Comment.) 
 
 
8. (SBU) Labor Supply: At the same time that Turkey is having 
difficulty creating new positions, it faces the challenge of 
an increasing number of entrants to the labor force.  High 
birth rates have led to demographic pressure on labor 
markets.  TUSIAD\'s recent labor market study pointed to a 
number of other factors, including the end of early 
retirement, and the increasing number of women entering the 
labor market.  In addition, experts predict that the gradual 
decline in the percentage of men participating in the labor 
force that has occurred over recent years will reverse itself 
in coming years.  (Galatasaray Professor Seyfettan Gursel, an 
author of the TUSIAD study, points out that one reason for 
Turkey\'s relatively good unemployment performance in the 
early 1990s was not growth or \"brilliant\" economic 
performance, but the fact that the declining level of male 
participation in the labor force held down the overall 
participation rate.) 
 
 
9. (SBU) Growth Requirements: According to TUSIAD, only 
sustained growth of six percent over the next eight years can 
allow Turkey to bring unemployment to an \"acceptable\" level 
of 6.5 percent.  Five percent growth leaves unemployment at 
10 percent, while anything less further compounds the 
problem.  Study authors point to the importance not just of 
steady macroeconomic policy to achieve this goal, but also to 
the need for the kinds of microeconomic reforms advocated by 
TGSD and other organizations to address the structural 
problems that make the labor market inflexible.  (Comment: 
Turkey also nees to pursue additional microeconomic reforms 
desgned to encourage competition and entrepreneurship  End 
Comment.) 
 
 
10. (SBU) Comment: Until strog economic growth begins to 
create significant ne employment, most Turks will remain 
sceptical abut whether a recovery has truly begun.  While 
ideas abound about how to make Turkey a more 
employment-friendly place, budget pressures will likely limit 
the government\'s ability to implement all the incentive 
programs-- or tax reductions-- that business would like to 
see.  End Comment.

nd (d). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary and Comment: The Istanbul Bar is at once a 
defender of the legal profession and historically a leader in 
promoting respect for human rights and rule of law in Turkey. 
 With a broad and ambivalent membership and a new 
nationalist/statist administration, however, the Bar 
currently appears unlikely to be a catalyst for change.  On 
the other hand, the Bar was quick to raise the anti-war 
banner to oppose U.S. intervention in Iraq and continues to 
seek opportunities to criticize and attack the U.S. and U.K. 
for their actions there.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
 
Current Bar Leadership 
---------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) The Istanbul Bar, the oldest such association in 
Turkey and the third largest in the world (after Tokyo and 
Cairo), elects a new President and slate of board members 
every two years by a simple vote of all its members (i.e., 
dues-paying, registered lawyers).  The previous Bar 
President, Yucel Sayman, was a well-regarded professor of law 
widely known for his pro-human rights views.  Often openly 
critical of the security apparatus, Sayman once told poloff 
he believed that there would never be another military coup 
in Turkey, as the current constitution represents a permanent 
state of military control.  At a recent \"robing\" ceremony in 
which young lawyers are raised to the bar, one new lawyer 
spoke at length of the high regard in which all lawyers held 
the previous Bar Administration, conspicuously making no 
mention of his feelings toward the current one. 
 
 
3. (C) Poloff spoke September 16 with Ayse Celikel, former 
Minister of Justice and herself a lawyer.  Celikel noted 
significant differences in philosophy between Sayman and 
current Bar President Kazim Kolcuoglu.  While Sayman was 
strongly pro-human rights, he also was well-known for his 
liberal and internationalist point of view.  Kolcuoglu, by 
contrast, tends to be more pro-establishment Ataturkist. 
Celikel noted that Bar administrations have significant 
impact upon the legal profession, even though their two-year 
terms of office are fairly short. 
 
 
4. (C) \"Principles First,\" a broad nationalist, statist 
coalition led by Kazim Kolcuoglu beat out two other 
candidates in last fall\'s election.  Sayman\'s group, a wide 
assortment of broadly democratic-minded lawyers competed 
under the banner of \"Contemporary (Lawyers),\" while Hasan 
Mollaoglu led the slate for \"Calling,\" a democratic, 
religious-leaning group.  Although the structure and 
functions of the Bar are not normally subject to change, 
lawyers with whom poloff spoke indicated Kolcuoglu\'s 
administration has a reputation for: administrative 
mismanagement, weak support for human rights and EU reforms, 
and a nationalistic/statist attitude.  Following complaints 
about inadequate reimbursement and general mismanagement, the 
current Bar has brought back one of Sayman\'s key staff 
members to rescue the critical \"public defender\" duty system 
which provides legal representation for those who cannot 
afford it. 
 
 
5. (C) Human rights and EU reform themes have been notably 
absent from the Bar\'s regular conferences and seminars, 
replaced instead with an emphasis on civil code and labor 
law.  Kolcuoglu, upon taking office, dissolved all standing 
committees of the Bar.  Though some lawyers have alleged that 
this was a direct attack on the Bar\'s human rights agenda, 
others (even more liberal Bar members) attribute it to a 
simple desire to clean house as a new administration. 
Additionally, the fact that the current administration has 
begun to fly the Turkish flag and play the national anthem at 
Bar meetings has not gone unnoticed. 
 
 
Iraq: Istanbul Bar\'s Active Anti-War Stance 
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
6. (U) The Istanbul Bar, throughout the build-up and during 
the actual war in Iraq, took a strong, vocal anti-war stance. 
 Regular meetings and marches down Istiklal Street, a major 
pedestrian area in European Istanbul, were sponsored by the 
bar Association.  Based on various conversations and 
observation of such rallies, it is clear that the anti-war 
stance was generally popular with Bar members.  Shortly 
before the election of the current Bar administration last 
November, moreover, all three candidates came together and 
issued a joint statement opposing U.S. intervention in Iraq. 
Lawyers typically attended rallies in large numbers, wearing 
robes to identify their profession.  More recent events in 
Iraq, notably the July 4 detention of Turkish Special Forces 
by U.S. troops, elicited sharp criticism from the Bar, both 
on their web site and in press releases. 
 
 
7. (U) In August, the Istanbul Bar filed a case with the 
newly-established International Criminal Court against the 
British government and senior British officials for their 
actions in Iraq.  \"We want them to be brought to justice,\" 
Kolcuoglu said in the announcement, \"...the invasion of Iraq 
is a clear infringement of the universal principles of 
legitimacy and justice... the killing and mistreatment of 
civilians and the looting in this country should be 
considered war crimes and crimes against humanity.\" 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
8. (C) Previously, the Istanbul Bar\'s human rights work 
provided an important prop to development of the rule of law 
in Turkey.  Though the current Bar administration maintains 
high standards of training and professional development for 
lawyers, their political focus has shifted from encouraging 
lawyers to work as human rights advocates to support for a 
firmly Ataturkist, anti-war agenda.  This is, on balance, a 
loss for Turkish civil society advocates.  End comment.

EDUCATION REFORMS 
 
1. (sbu) Summary: Ask anyone in Istanbul what\'s wrong with 
the Turkish education system and you are likely to get the 
same answer: overcrowded, under-funded schools tied up in 
bureaucratic red tape.  Fixing the problem, however, has been 
the subject of considerable acrimonious political debate. 
Critics charge that the last several governments have all 
\"used\" education reform in attempts to solidify and expand 
their support base, and that AK is similarly using the issue 
as a back-door to achieving a secret aim to Islamicize Turkey 
and Turkish society.  Those defending AK\'s proposals for 
higher education reform and some of its plans for education 
as a whole say they would go a long way towards addressing 
inherent injustices and much-needed reforms and might also 
address a widespread desire for a more conservative and 
religious environment in Istanbul\'s schools.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (sbu) As schools across the city reopen after summer 
recess, Istanbul residents are unhappy and worried that their 
children are not getting an adequate education.  One taxi 
driver remarked that there is education \"for the rich, but 
not the poor\" (i.e., the rich send their kids to private 
schools), while a lower-class mother of three said that the 
system offers \"zilch.\"  With 65 students per primary school 
classroom in Istanbul (after the school day has already been 
divided into separate morning and afternoon sessions), it is 
clear there is a chronic shortage of rooms and teachers. 
Only 10 percent of the students who take the national 
university entrance exams are able to secure places in 
Turkish universities (both private and public).  Once at 
university, both students and professors chafe under the 
centralized restrictions and controls that have been in place 
since the 1980 coup put an end to widespread student riots 
and infighting. 
 
 
Higher Education Council (YOK) and University Reforms 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
3. (sbu) AK higher education reform proposals aimed at 
reducing the authority and autonomy of the much-hated Higher 
Education Council (YOK) have provoked a vigorous debate. 
Critics we have talked to (including professionals, 
educators, and the YOK Chairman) claim that rhetoric about 
\"democracy\" and \"efficiency\" merely cloak a hidden Islamic 
agenda.  Specifically, they claim that decentralizing 
education, by allowing professors to elect their own 
administrators and rectors, for example, will \"hand over 
control\" of the universities (beginning with Erzurum and 
Marmara Universities) to the \"Islamists.\"  One university 
administrator lamented that the AK party had actually \"forced 
him to defend YOK.\"  The vice chairman of the Istanbul 
Association of University Professors defended the proposals, 
however, noting that while imperfect, they had incorporated 
many of the association\'s suggestions. 
 
 
Imam-Hatip (Preacher) Schools and Religious Education 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
4. (sbu) As \"proof\" of the government\'s secret Islamist 
agenda, critics charge that AK wants to boost attendance in 
the country\'s state-run imam-hatip (preacher) schools (of 
which there are 26 in Istanbul, including the one Prime 
Minister Erdogan attended), despite the fact that the number 
of graduates far exceeds the need for imams.  By amending a 
point system for the national university entrance exam that 
currently disadvantages graduates of vocational schools (only 
8 percent of which are imam-hatip schools), AK would 
roll-back what was a thinly-veiled and highly successful 
effort initiated in 1997 to discourage families from sending 
their children to imam-hatip schools.  (Note: Imam-hatip 
enrollment appears to have jumped by 80 percent this year in 
Istanbul, at least in part on the expectation that the new 
government would carry out its promises in this regard.  End 
Note.)  Suspicious of anyone who sends their children to such 
schools, critics worry that increasing numbers of religiously 
conservative graduates (note: in addition to the normal 
curriculum, imam-hatip students spend half of their class 
time in religion courses) will go on to university and 
eventually \"infiltrate\" the state bureaucracy.  The head of 
an Istanbul imam-hatip graduate association simply pointed to 
the injustice of a system (\"affecting all vocational schools, 
not just imam-hatips\") in which an imam-hatip student this 
year received a perfect raw score on one of the national 
exams and did not have enough \"points\" to get into any of the 
university departments he had selected.  The administrator of 
an Istanbul imam-hatip school noted that the point system 
isn\'t even \"legal\" according to existing laws.  He also 
defended the decision of parents to choose such schools, not 
so their children will become imams, but so they can learn 
about religion in a more \"morally conservative\" environment. 
 
 
School Vouchers and Free Textbooks 
---------------------------------- 
5. (sbu) Another plan to send 10,000 poor students to private 
high schools with government vouchers was already vetoed by 
President Sezer on August 14 on the grounds that many of the 
private schools selected for the program had been 
\"established by people for other reasons\" (i.e., Islamist). 
(Note: Many of the schools were reportedly established by 
Fethullah Gulen and other tarikats or brotherhoods).  Sezer\'s 
decision was welcomed by many government critics who argued 
that the vouchers would merely transfer government funds to 
tarikat-run schools and educate future generations to be 
prejudiced against secularism.  Yet another project that has 
yet to be finalized is a government promise to provide free 
textbooks to students.  An Istanbul-based NGO education 
expert labeled this a \"blatant hand-out\" that the government 
would almost certainly try to roll out shortly before next 
year\'s local elections.  A teachers\' union representative 
stopped short of accusing the government of seeking to 
\"rewrite\" history, but speculated that the government would 
almost certainly choose books that are more in line with 
their political views and wondered aloud which government 
crony would be awarded the publishing contract.  The fact 
that photos and \"messages\" of the PM and Education Minister 
were included in some of the recently-distributed books has 
already been labeled by critics as inappropriate propaganda. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
6. (sbu) While almost all Istanbul residents agree on the 
need for education reform, at least a substantial minority, 
particularly among the secular elite, do not trust the AK 
government to guide the process.  There is no clear answer on 
whether AK\'s reforms are intended to \"islamicize\" Turkey, but 
they do at least represent an effort to address some of the 
education system\'s shortcomings.  The elements of the 
discussion that draw the most direct fire (the voucher plan 
and grumblings about the headscarf ban) still seem to command 
a good deal of support among the general public in Istanbul.

1. (C) Summary: Istanbul Republican People\'s Party (CHP) 
contacts report widespread internal discontent with CHP 
Chairman Baykal and the CHP\'s performance over the last 
several months.  Although Baykal has successfully taken firm 
control of the Istanbul party organization, the party has so 
far been unable to put forward any candidates for Istanbul 
City Hall that promise to mobilize and reinforce their 
eroding support base.  Resigned over their party\'s inability 
to increase its public support, our contacts openly admit 
that they expect a CHP failure at the polls in next spring\'s 
local elections to open the way for internal change within 
the party. 
 
 
Baykal Strengthens Hold on Istanbul Organization 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2. (C) Istanbul has long been a major battleground within the 
CHP organization, and this year\'s Istanbul Congress was 
further confirmation of that fact (ref A).  In the face of 
opposition and criticism, Baykal made a strong push to ensure 
that his people dominated the delegate list that Istanbul 
will send to the National Congress and would continue to 
control the Istanbul organization.  Mehmet Boluk, a former 
Istanbul Chairman and the principal challenger to Baykal\'s 
candidate in the August 3 Congress, argued that the party is 
losing its base on the left and has not been sufficiently 
vocal in opposition.  Although Boluk\'s challenge failed, he 
told poloff that \"most\" of the party faithful are \"unhappy\" 
with Baykal, but are keeping their opposition quiet until 
next spring\'s local elections.  Once the elections are over, 
Boluk predicted a sea change within the party ranks.  (Note: 
Boluk has also filed a court case alleging that Baykal 
illegally stacked the August 3 Istanbul Congress with 
supporters by falsifying local residency documents.) 
 
 
The Big Prize: Istanbul Mayoralty 
--------------------------------- 
3. (C) None of our CHP interlocutors expect major 
developments at the upcoming CHP Congress (see also ref B), 
with all eyes focused instead on next spring\'s municipal 
elections.  Most agree that the Justice and Development (AK) 
Party commands significantly more local support than CHP, and 
that the electoral math leaves CHP with only a narrow 
opportunity to take the Mayoralty (note: this would require a 
split among potential AKP supporters between 
still-independent Istanbul Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna and an 
unnamed AKP candidate).  Local CHP insiders Boluk and Sisli 
District Mayor Mustafa Sarigul were somewhat defeatist about 
CHP\'s electoral prospects and even eager to use a failure 
(defined as anything less than the 19 percent CHP polled 
nationally last year) to bring about internal change in the 
party. 
 
 
4. (C) Sarigul said that although he had been approached 
about running for the Istanbul Mayoralty (note: he is widely 
considered one of CHP\'s best potential candidates), he has 
since decided that his chances of winning do not justify a 
decision to run.  Former State Minister and Istanbul MP Kemal 
Dervis\' name continues to be floated, but close confidante 
and fellow Istanbul MP Damla Gurel downplayed that 
likelihood.  Former Foreign Minister and current New Turkey 
Party (YTP) Chairman Ismail Cem has also been mentioned as a 
possible candidate (in the unlikely event that CHP and YTP 
could cement a pre-election alliance), but few take that 
prospect seriously. 
 
 
Failure in 2004 = Chance for Change? 
------------------------------------ 
5. (C) Assessing CHP\'s performance as the country\'s only 
opposition party since last year\'s elections, former Istanbul 
Chairman Mehmet Boluk said that this must be one of the only 
parties in recent history to \"lose public support while in 
opposition.\"  Istanbul MP Damla Gurel (a newcomer to CHP who 
joined the party last year with former State Minister Kemal 
Dervis) admitted candidly to poloff that \"most party members 
are unhappy.\"  Professing to have good personal relations 
with Baykal, Gurel nevertheless criticized him for not 
promoting party teamwork, for failing to \"follow through\" on 
commitments, and for a total inability to \"communicate\" his 
vision and plans both within the party and to the general 
public. 
 
 
6. (C) Sisli Mayor Sarigul also criticized Baykal and the CHP 
leadership, particularly for failing to challenge AKP by 
appealing directly to the voters.  Rather than criticize 
AKP\'s plans for a property amnesty and sale of forest lands, 
for example, Sarigul argues that CHP should have embraced the 
proposal and taken it even further (see also ref C).  We are 
supposed to be the social democrats, but we are doing nothing 
to reach out to the people who need us, Sarigul complained. 
(Note: Boasting of having received the largest number of 
votes among all of the Istanbul delegates to the National 
Congress, Sarigul clearly sees himself as a potential future 
leader of the party). 
 
 
7. (C) Former CHP Chairman Altan Oymen (who was defeated by 
Baykal when he returned to the party chairmanship in 2001) 
was more supportive of Baykal and his performance, but 
conceded that CHP had failed to increase its support among 
the general public.  Oymen attributed this to the party\'s 
failure to bring together the other left and center-left 
parties, many of which are dominated by former CHP members. 
Gurel, Sarigul, and Oymen all agreed that anything less than 
19 percent of the vote in the upcoming elections would 
trigger an internal movement for change within the party. 
Asked how such change would materialize in a party that is 
tightly controlled by the chairman, Sarigul and Oymen 
separately explained that an electoral failure would prompt 
discussions and debate in the party ranks and would embolden 
other power brokers to push for change (perhaps Baykal 
himself would resign, Oymen added).

SUBJECT: WHOSE ISLAM? AK PARTI AND ISTANBUL ALEVIS 
 
 
Classified By: CG David L. Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Alevis, followers of a heterodox 
religious-cultural offshoot of Shi\'a Islam and Anatolian 
Sufism, probably number about 10 percent of Turkey\'s 
population (7 million, with several million in Istanbul), 
although some Alevis assert that there are 25 million. 
Persecuted by the Ottomans and historically secularist since 
the founding of the Turkish Republic, Alevis have 
historically voted left, especially for CHP.  Though Alevi 
leaders distanced themselves from CHP in the November 2002 
elections, no affinity for AK Parti has taken its place. 
Recent comments by PM Erdogan have been seen by Istanbul 
Alevis as confirming their suspicions of AK\'s lack of 
sympathy for their beliefs.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
The Alevi place in Turkish politics 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
2. (U) No reliable figures exist for the number of Alevis in 
Turkey.  In a country of 70 million people, Alevi leaders 
frequently claim that 1/4 to 1/3 of the population are Alevi. 
 We think a more accurate estimate is 10 percent of the 
population, or seven million.  Alevi houses of worship, 
called Cem Evis, are scattered throughout Istanbul, filled 
with Alevis who previously lived in central Anatolia.  Alevis 
from the same village often congregate at the same Cem Evi 
and live in the same neighborhood. 
 
 
3. (U) Alevis were periodically and viciously persecuted by 
the authorities for their \"heretical\" religious views during 
the Ottoman imperial era.  When Ataturk emerged as a 
political force in Central Anatolia in the early 1920s, 
Alevis were some of his earliest and fiercest supporters 
because they saw him as willing to suppress the Sunni 
majority.  Support for CHP, the party founded by Ataturk, 
continued to be strong until the November 2002 parliamentary 
elections.  Several Alevi leaders, among them Prof. Izzettin 
Dogan (President of the Cem Foundation), said publicly that 
CHP had done very little for Alevis over the years, and that 
Alevis should feel no special need to vote for them. 
According to Prof. Dogan, most Alevis elected not to vote 
rather than shift their support to another party. 
 
 
4. (U) Although a Kemalist form of secularism has been 
ensconced in all republican constitutions as a founding 
principal of the Turkish state, the government controls and 
funds Sunni Islam through the Diyanet.  Christians and Jews 
are guaranteed some protection for their religious practices 
and facilities, but Alevis and their places of worship are 
not. 
 
 
Religion, culture, or both? 
--------------------------- 
 
 
5. (C) On September 4, during a trip to Germany, PM Erdogan 
discussed the status of Cem Evis in Turkey, saying: \"...you 
cannot compare Cem Evis to mosques.  One is a place of 
worship, whereas the other is only a house of culture.  We 
cannot provide the help for Cem Evis that we do for mosques.\" 
 In a September 12 conversation with Poloff, AK Parti 
Istanbul Vice Chairman Murat Yalcintas (son of AK heavyweight 
and MP Nevzat Yalcintas) confirmed AK\'s position that Alevi 
houses of worship do not rate protection and funding similar 
to mosques.  Yalcintas said that the Prime Minister\'s 
comments were widely supported within AK Parti ranks. 
Yalcintas was critical of Alevi and Shi\'a beliefs, saying 
\"these people claim to be the followers of Ali and the family 
of the Prophet.  If they honor Ali, they should pray like Ali 
did, and go to a mosque.\"  In his view, a Cem Evi could only 
claim status as a religious house of worship if Alevis 
disavowed being Muslims. 
 
 
7. (C) In a September 5 meeting with Poloff, board members of 
the Haci Bektas-i Foundation (one of the two largest Alevi 
organizations in Turkey, representing the committed left wing 
of Alevidom) said they viewed PM Erdogan\'s comments as being 
\"both a true reflection of his beliefs and, unfortunately, a 
legally correct statement,\" in that there is no legal status 
or funding for Cem Evis in existing Turkish law.  The board 
members pointed out that they often have difficulty in 
obtaining permission for building facilities, and get no 
government funding from the Diyanet.  Moreover, they 
complained, Diyanet funds are applied to building mosques, 
including in wholly-Alevi villages.  Alevi tax dollars are 
thus being used to convert Alevis to Sunni Islam. 
 
 
8. (C) Muharrem Eren, President of the Karacaahmet Sultan 
organization (a local, well-established, independent Alevi 
organization based in the conservative Uskudar neighborhood 
that claims over 5000 active members) told poloff that he and 
his followers do not expect the AK government to address 
their concerns.  Eren claimed that when PM Erdogan was 
Istanbul Mayor he had tried to \"destroy\" their organization, 
at one point actually sending a demolition team in an effort 
to dismantle their Cem Evi in the middle of the night.  Eren 
emphasized the widely-held Alevi view that the preservation 
of their religion and culture depends on strict enforcement 
of Ataturk\'s secular principles and that his political 
sympathies continue to lie with the CHP. 
 
 
Disadvantaged Alevis? 
--------------------- 
 
 
9. (C) Alevis have long charged that they are excluded from 
positions of leadership in Turkish society, and assert that 
high military, governmental, or judicial positions are not 
open to them.  On the other hand, mainstream Sunni Muslim 
contacts claim that Alevis are disproportionately represented 
in high military, bureaucratic, and business circles; 
Islamist PM Erbakan played on this view when he had prominent 
members of his 1996-7 government warn against the 
\"Syrianization\" (i.e. secularization) of Turkey.  Prof. Dogan 
told us, however, that he was troubled by recent complaints 
from members of his community that Alevis who are civil 
servants have been pressured to attend Sunni religious 
services.  Reportedly, people he believes to be AK Parti 
functionaries have come to government ministries, asking 
office directors to regularly pray and attend services at a 
mosque.  According to Dogan, in some few cases, Alevis have 
been pressured into resigning. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
10. (C) The views expressed by Dogan, Haci Bektas-i board 
members, and Karacaahmet Sultan do not reflect the full 
spectrum of the Istanbul Alevi community, but together they 
claim to represent the concerns and aspirations of more than 
a million Istanbul residents.  The latest reaction over PM 
Erdogan\'s statement illustrates a considerable divide between 
AK and Turkey\'s Alevi community.  Some AK supporters, while 
supportive of religious freedom in general (especially when 
it relates to Sunni Islamic religious expression), regard 
Alevis as heretics; others consider Alevis to be Sunnis at 
heart (they have common circumcision and burial rites), 
wayward Sunnis, or merely a cultural group.  This latter view 
is given weight by the Alevi\'s use of alcohol, avoidance of 
fasting during Ramazan, and hanging of pictures of Ataturk 
alongside those of Ali in their Cem Evis.  End comment.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL VIEWS ON SENDING TURKISH TROOPS TO IRAQ 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Istanbul residents from all walks of life 
continue to worry about the situation in Iraq and the 
prospect of sending troops to Iraq.  Whomever we meet with, 
and whatever the subject, the conversation inevitably turns 
to Iraq.  Despite the widespread opposition before the U.S. 
intervention, Turks here are now split on the issue of 
whether to send troops to Iraq.  Many see the March 1 
decision and the preceding negotiations as having been 
\"disastrous\" for U.S.-Turkish relations.  Nevertheless, 
several of our interlocutors insist on the need for a U.N. 
Security Council (or at least NATO) mandate.  With the 
notable exception of the Turkish Industrialists\' and 
Businessmen\'s Association (TUSIAD), the business community 
has largely come out in support of Turkish participation in 
Iraq on the grounds that it would help secure a foothold for 
Turkish companies in that market and would ensure the 
continuation of good U.S.-Turkish relations.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) The following sample of comments on Iraq provide a 
general snapshot of the views that we have been hearing: 
 
 
-- Istanbul Health Director (and close acquaintance of PM 
Erdogan) Erman Tuncer waxed eloquently on the importance of 
U.S.-Turkish relations, lamented how difficult (but 
democratic and correct) the March 1 decision had been, and 
insisted that a UNSCR would be critical to securing the 
participation of Turkish peacekeepers (Note: Tuncer somewhat 
disingenuously sought to blame this prerequisite on President 
Sezer\'s position. End Note). 
 
 
-- Former Istanbul CHP Chairman (and recent challenger) 
Mehmet Boluk also emphasized the need to maintain the 
U.S.-Turkish relationship and said that he would have 
supported closer cooperation with the U.S. from the 
beginning, including in the March 1 vote.  Boluk criticized 
the CHP for not behaving like a \"real\" opposition and for 
ignoring Turkey\'s interests, noting that the British 
opposition had provided critical support to British PM Blair. 
 (Note: Boluk has an axe to grind with CHP Chairman Baykal. 
End Note). 
 
 
-- Istanbul AKP Vice Chairman Murat Yalcintas told us that 
the AKP rank and file are opposed to sending Turkish 
peacekeepers, seeing it as an American effort to minimize 
U.S. casualties.  They are suspicious, moreover, as to why 
the U.S. has not acted against the PKK terrorists in northern 
Iraq.  Without some developments on that front, Yalcintas 
thinks it will be difficult to persuade the general public 
and even AKP parliamentarians to support sending Turkish 
troops. 
 
 
-- CHP parliamentarian Damla Gurel defended her decision to 
vote against the March 1 resolution on the grounds that 
\"inside AKP sources\" had told them that the vote would pass 
in any case and to do otherwise would have been personal 
\"political suicide.\"  Both Gurel and fellow CHP 
parliamentarian Onur Oymen separately told poloff that CHP is 
in close consultation with President Sezer and that the party 
remains opposed to any deployment of Turkish forces without a 
U.N. (or at least NATO) mandate. 
 
 
-- The managing director of AK Sigorta (one of the top three 
Turkish insurance companies) Ragip Yergin told poloff that 
Turkey had made a mistake not approving the March 1 
resolution and that PM Erdogan \"could not afford\" to have 
another resolution fail (with or without a UNSCR).  If there 
is a UNSCR, approval of a Turkish resolution is a 
\"non-issue.\" 
 
 
-- MUSIAD Vice Chairman and Albayrak General Coordinator Omer 
Bolat said that he (and most MUSIAD members) supported the 
March 1 decision to deny U.S. troops access to Turkey, but 
that \"now the situation is different.\"  Bolat told us that 
the U.S. should move quickly to multilateralize the foreign 
presence in Iraq and Turkey should participate (providing 
there is a new UNSCR). 
 
 
-- TUSIAD\'s position shifted in the other direction, however, 
with an equivocal September 19th statement by Chairman Tuncay 
Ozilhan.  While the press widely reported that Ozilhan called 
for a UN resolution as a precondition for any decision to 
send troops to Iraq, and argued that it did not appear likely 
that Turkish troops could contribute to stability there, 
TUSIAD sources stress that his actual statement (which they 
concede was \"unfortunately worded\") simply argued that 
because of increasing uncertainty in Iraq, \"Turkey must think 
more deeply\" about whether sending troops will contribute to 
stability there. 
 
 
-- Ulker (food processing giant) CEO Murat Ulker, while 
professing ignorance on political issues, said that \"Saddam 
had to go and only the U.S. could do it.\"  Ulker expressed 
regret about the March 1 decision and support for a possible 
future deployment of Turkish troops. 
 
 
3. (C) Comment: The impression we get here is that a decision 
to send troops remains deeply unpopular.  At the same time, 
many of those who supported the March 1 decision acknowledge 
that the situation has changed.  Most are responsive to the 
argument that contributing to a stable, democratic, secular, 
and prosperous Iraq is very much in Turkey\'s own interests, 
but, at a minimum, they are looking for a UNSCR to provide 
\"international legitimacy\" and a cover to disassociate a 
Turkish troop presence from the unpopular U.S. \"occupation.\" 
The most perplexing shift is that of TUSIAD, for despite 
arguments by Deputy Chairman Mustafa Koc and others that the 
September 19 statement did not represent a change in the 
organization\'s policy, it clearly marks a step back from 
TUSIAD\'s much more unequivocal position in favor of the March 
1 resolution.  Some argue that TUSIAD sensed the way the wind 
was blowing in the government, but former Ambassador and 
TUSIAD board member Cem Duna told us on September 24 that in 
his view the odds of Turkey\'s ultimately providing troops are 
still \"well above 50 percent.\"  He himself noted, however, 
that he had felt similarly in March.  In any case, though 
TUSIAD represents Turkey\'s largest companies, it is not part 
of the AK government\'s constituency, and so is largely 
irrelevant to this government\'s decision making process.

SUBJECT: WEIGHING CORPORATE TURKEY\'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Central Bank Governor Sureyya Serdengcti 
this month added his voice to those expressing concern about 
the risks to the Turkish economy posed by the growing open 
positions of companies in the real sector.  Observers agree 
that while the Turkish banking sector-- whose own open 
positions in 2001 contributed to the depth of that year\'s 
banking crisis-- is now in a much more solid position, the 
real sector is increasingly exposed to foreign exchange risk. 
 Recent Central Bank statistics show that at the end of the 
first quarter, 43 leading industrial companies had a net 
exposure of 4.3 billion USD, with ten leading firms 
accounting for three-quarters of that total, while the total 
exposure of the 214 companies on the Istanbul stock exchange 
was over 6 billion USD.  Despite Serdengecti\'s warning, 
company officials downplay the risk, and many economists 
concur that worry about the issue is exaggerated.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Central Bank Concerns: Speaking to the Ankara Chamber 
of Industry on September 18, Serdengecti invoked a 
traditional Turkish proverb to warn companies in the real 
sector that \"if you get burned by a risk you took knowingly, 
don\'t cry.\"  He noted that while the banking sector currently 
has only limited exposure to foreign exchange risk because of 
its small open position, the growing open position of Turkish 
firms leaves them increasingly exposed to unforeseen 
movements in the lira\'s foreign exchange rate.  He conceded 
that this is not a problem if the firm has foreign exchange 
earnings, but that if they do not, and are \"seized by 
illusions,\" then they will be burned. 
 
 
3. (SBU) An Angry Reaction: Industrial leaders did not react 
well to Serdengecti\'s counsel.  Ibrahim Ozdogan, head of 
GISAD YK, commented that a country\'s central bank head should 
work first to provide confidence to the markets, and only 
then turn to offering advice, while leading exporter Ahmet 
Zorlu noted that his group has little foreign exchange 
exposure, but has been hurt by the dollar\'s decline. 
Suleyman Orakcioglu, head of the textile companies 
association IKTIB, emphasized that he did not wish to enter 
into a dispute with the Central Bank, but that his 
organization\'s key goal is to lower the price of exporters\' 
inputs, given their current high level, despite the dollar\'s 
decline. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Statistical backing: Recent statistics drawn both 
from Central Bank reports and company filings with the 
Istanbul Stock Exchange highlight the issue, though they 
provide contradictory indications about whether it has grown 
in scope in the recent past.  Stock exchange figures show 
that 43 companies in the exchange\'s industrial index have a 
total foreign exchange exposure of 4.3 billion USD. 
Three-quarters of that total is held by just the ten largest 
firms.  Moreover, Central Bank officials told Emboffs that 
the largest exposures were with the oil refiner Tupras and 
the petroleum distributor Petrol Ofisi.  They expressed a 
lack of concern about these two companies\' foreign exchange 
exposure given that they were in the dollar-linked oil 
business.  The exposure increases only marginally when all 
214 companies in the exchange are included, reaching a total 
of 6 billion USD.  An analysis by Disbank\'s economic research 
team, however, shows that this total actually represents a 
decline from these firms\' total exposure in the fourth 
quarter of 2002 (which then approached 7 billion USD). 
Interestingly, while there has been a steady (albeit gradual) 
decline in the exposure of firms with foreign investment 
since the second quarter of 2002, the exposure of firms 
without foreign investment shot up at the end of that year, 
and has only now begun to decline gradually. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Varying Motives: Historically, much of corporate 
Turkey\'s borrowing has taken place offshore, given high 
interest rates on Turkish lira loans.  (Even today real rates 
are hovering in the 12-14 percent range on short term 
instruments, well above comparable dollar or Euro rates). 
Companies thus traditionally borrow at low interest rates in 
foreign currency, and then either import inputs or convert 
the loan into lira for domestic consumption or investments. 
As Serdengecti noted, the degree of risk to which they are 
exposed depends on the use to which they put the loan, and 
whether they have a natural hedge in the form of foreign 
currency earnings.

SUBJECT: WEIGHIG CORPORATE TURKEY\'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK 
 
 
6. SBU) How Significant?: Given these varying motives and 
risk factors, analysts and economists are divided on the 
significance of the issue.  Vural Akisik, Chairman of the 
board of Petrol Ofisi, which has one of the largest open 
positions among Turkish companies (but is in a dollar-linked 
industry), argued that the total open position figure is not 
particularly meaningful, given that companies open positions 
for many reasons.  If the open position is financing a 
capital import, he argued, which will be used to generate a 
foreign currency income stream, this is less of a problem 
than if it is financing a consumption or intermediary good. 
Unfortunately, however, there are no good figures available 
which separate out what percentage of foreign exchange 
borrowings are being used for this purpose.  Akisik concurred 
that if companies are using the funds to invest in treasury 
bills, as banks did before the last crisis, they would be 
exposed to significant risk in the event of a correction. 
Given that few foreign banks would extend credits for such a 
purpose, however, he saw this risk as being limited.  Ersin 
Ozince, CEO of Isbank, similarly argued that the largest 
exchange rate challenge facing Turkey\'s real sector is not 
that posed by its open position, but that posed to its 
competitiveness.  He cited the example of the Is company that 
produces soda ash for glass production, noting that it is 
currently cheaper to import that raw material from abroad 
than to produce it in Turkey. 
 
 
7. (SBU) A Mixed Bag: Investment analysts largely agree that 
the open position problem is not at a critical level.  A 
recent analysis by ATA Invest, one of Istanbul\'s largest 
brokerages, noted that many companies are largely hedged 
against recent foreign exchange developments because while 
their exports are largely denominated in Euros, which has 
moved less against the lira, their raw material inputs and 
even some local purchases are dollar denominated.  For those 
companies with largely Turkish lira income flows, recent 
exchange movements will benefit them in the short term. 
Hence, in ATA\'s view, the dollar debts of Turkcell and Petrol 
Ofisi should give those companies large FX gains in the 
second quarter, though of course exposing them to FX losses 
if there is a correction.  ATA noted that most firms\' debts 
were to finance inputs, but did highlight two companies, 
Cimsa and Migros, a large food retailer, which had placed 
their liquid assets in TL instruments (a long-standing 
tradition in the fast-moving retailing sector, where profit 
has typically stemmed more from cash-flow management than 
core operations.) 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: Most analysts agree that the current 
situation is less worrisome than that which preceded the last 
crisis, in that the banking system itself no longer is at 
risk; instead, specific companies have put themselves at the 
mercy of the foreign exchange rate.  Bender analysts Emin 
Ozturk and Murat Gulkan make one noteworthy caveat to this 
reassuring picture, however: given that banks and real sector 
firms coexist inside the same large holdings, it can be 
argued that some holdings have simply moved their foreign 
exchange games from a sector where they are now forbidden by 
regulatory rules (the banks) to one where there is less 
supervision (the real sector).  But given the natural hedge 
of foreign currency income, and the fact that a not 
insignificant part of the exposure is related to capital 
goods purchases, the overall problem looms less large than it 
did in the past.  Beyond this, many see no reason for a lira 
correction in the near to mid-term; indeed some commentators 
have even outlined scenarios where the lira could reach 1.3 
million to the dollar or higher.  End Comment.

1. (sbu) Summary: During courtesy calls on the Armenian 
Patriarch, Chief Rabbi, and Syrian Orthodox Metropolitan, 
Ambassador Edelman promised to maintain close relations with 
each community and to press the GOT to implement broader 
protection for religious freedom in Turkey.  Each of the 
community leaders detailed his principal concerns and 
problems, including a general shared frustration with the 
state bureaucracy\'s failure to implement recent legislative 
changes.  End Summary. 
 
 
Armenian Patriarch Mesrob Mutafyan II 
------------------------------------- 
2. (c) Mesrob reminded the Ambassador that the 65,000-strong 
Armenian community is the largest non-Muslim community in 
Turkey.  In addition to supporting one of only four Armenian 
Orthodox Patriarchs, its 45 churches, 17 schools, and active 
press give it an important voice in the global Armenian 
community.  Additionally, Mesrob said that he estimates there 
are about 1 million Turks of \"concealed\" Armenian descent 
living as Muslims in Turkey and about 120 of them \"convert 
back\" to Orthodoxy each year.  Mesrob\'s principal complaint 
about the GOT is its failure to recognize the legal 
personality of the patriarchate (unlike the Greeks, Mesrob is 
content to send Armenian priests abroad -- to Jerusalem or 
Armenia -- for training).  Mesrob said that, despite press 
reports, he does not believe his being denied a seat on a 
plane to Van was the result of any deliberate harassment. 
Mesrob said that he actively supports Turkey\'s EU membership 
and has done what he can to bring Turkey and Armenia together 
(a task that he said has been complicated by aggressive 
statements from the Armenian government).  Mesrob added that 
he hopes to visit the Armenian communities in Baghdad and 
Jerusalem when the security situations there improve. 
 
 
Chief Rabbi Isak Haleva 
----------------------- 
3. (sbu) Haleva and the members of the Jewish Lay Council 
told the Ambassador that the 22,000-strong Jewish community 
has had \"no particular problems or difficulties\" with the 
Turkish government.  When occasional issues arise, they 
prefer to use their \"excellent\" personal relations with the 
PM, FM, and even Turkish military to resolve them.  Lay 
Council President Bensiyon Pinto noted that while the Greeks 
are seeking to reclaim and register over 2000 properties, the 
Jewish community has only 4 such claims.  The community has 
17 active synagogues, a school, a museum, and other social 
facilities.  Agreements with two U.S. universities enable 
them to send students and future rabbis abroad for training. 
Members of the Council claimed that while they have 
experienced no direct restrictions on their freedom to 
worship, occasional problems with the bureaucracy make life 
difficult.  Others added that some of the pro-Islamic press 
often print anti-Semitic remarks. 
 
 
Syrian Orthodox Metropolitan Yusuf Cetin 
---------------------------------------- 
4. (sbu) Cetin told the Ambassador that the Syrian Orthodox 
community in Turkey had shrunk from 60,000 to 15,000 in the 
last 30 years, largely due to immigration to Europe, 
Australia, and the U.S. (where he said there are two 
Metropolitans ministering to 25,000 Syrian Orthodox).  The 
remaining community is centered in Istanbul and the 
Southeast, particularly near Mardin.  With only one church in 
Istanbul and restrictive laws preventing them from building 
others, the local community has been forced to seek 
agreements with churches of other denominations.  With no 
religious schools, its priests are educated at two 
monasteries in Istanbul and five in the Southeast (although 
students also study simultaneously at public schools).  Cetin 
said that he too supports Turkey\'s EU membership and is 
pleased with recent legislative reforms, but following up on 
implementation will be very important.  He pointed to recent 
attacks on the first non-Muslim university rector (a 
Christian) as an example of how Turkish society needs to 
change. 
 
 
5. (sbu) In all three of these meetings the Ambassador 
stressed his determination to maintain close relations with 
the religious communities, to press the Turkish government to 
follow up in implementing recent positive reforms and to 
further broaden its protection of religious freedom.  The 
Ambassador told his interlocutors that he has already raised 
these issues with the PM and the relevant ministers and is 
hopeful that progress can be made before or during the May 
2004 NATO Summit in Istanbul and the likely visit of 
President Bush.

1. (C) Summary: A recent extortion campaign against members 
of a Jewish retirement home\'s board of directors has shaken 
Istanbul\'s Jewish community.  One of the board members, Yasef 
Yahya, was killed on August 22 at his office.  Starting three 
weeks ago, other members of the board have been contacted 
with demands for large sums of money.  Another Jewish 
businessman, Mois Konur, was killed on October 8, in what 
appears to be an unrelated incident.  Police believe the 
killings were criminal rather than political.  End Summary. 
 
 
Retirement Home Killing and Extortion 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
2. (U) On August 22, a 39-year-old Jewish dentist, Yasef 
Yahya, was killed in his office in Sisli, in central European 
Istanbul.  Yahya was a member of the board of directors of a 
Jewish retirement home, a member of B\'nai Brith, and a 
regular attendee at the Haskoy synagogue.  According to press 
reports, Yahya was killed \"execution style,\" with a single 
bullet to the head.  Police report that Yahya was found with 
a woman\'s stocking stuffed in his mouth, and his briefcase 
and cell phone were missing.  However, Yahya\'s wallet, 
containing TL 43 million (USD 31) and his watch were still on 
the body. 
 
 
3. (C) Starting on September 26, another member of the board 
of directors of the same retirement home, Jaki (or Zeki) 
Kaziz began receiving threatening phone calls.  In 
conversation with Lina Filiba, Vice President of the Jewish 
Community\'s Lay Council, Poloff learned that calls were all 
made from a single cell phone number (90-555-512-4765). 
Kaziz was told that he had to pay one million euros, later 
reduced to USD 500,000.  As a means of showing how serious he 
was, the caller told Kaziz to look at 
\"yahya2010@hotmail.com,\" using password \"5555.\"  According to 
Filiba, in the e-mails were personal details about Yahya, 
including credit card numbers.  Several threatening e-mails 
came from \"efraim@hotmail.com.\" 
 
 
4. (C) Threatening calls were also made to the office of the 
president of the retirement home board, Yasar Natan.  Natan 
recently died, however, and his son spoke with the caller. 
Again, the caller made threats and demanded USD 500,000. 
Filiba said a third member of the board was contacted at 
home, and the caller said his name was \"Murat Velioglu.\" 
 
 
5. (C) The Jewish Community has shared all information with 
the Istanbul police regarding this case.  All families of the 
retirement home board members are now in hiding, and change 
residence weekly.  Jewish Community Lay Council President 
Bensiyon Pinto has spoken directly with both the Minister of 
the Interior and PM Erdogan about the case.  The Israeli 
Consul General was also informed of the situation. 
 
 
Caterer killed 
-------------- 
 
 
6. (C) Meanwhile, in an apparently unrelated incident, Mois 
Konur, a 29-year-old caterer was killed while walking on the 
street on October 8.  According to Jewish Community contacts, 
Konur may have had past interaction with organized crime in 
Turkey, possibly including unpaid debts.  Konur\'s family was 
unaware of any prior threats to him or of the retirement home 
case in general.  While Israeli and French press have 
reportedly linked the two killings, Jewish Community 
contacts, and the Istanbul police, believe they are separate. 
 
 
Pattern of Anti-Jewish Violence? 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
7. (C) In a discussion following the death of Yahya with 
other Jewish small business owners, some community members 
noted that it is not uncommon for Jewish small business 
owners to be threatened, particularly by \"MHP supporter 
types.\"  Small time threats for protection money are \"common 
for our doctors,\" according to Filiba.  However, small 
business owners noted in the same conversation that similar 
threats do occur with their Turkish colleagues as well. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
8. (C) At this point, the cases appear to involve extortion 
and organized crime.  Post will continue to monitor them, 
however, and report if any linkage to larger political 
motivations or groups which may have an anti-semitic agenda 
is discovered.

Ibrahim Kahraman of the Kaptan Foreign Trade Company to 
review the status of the equipment order cited in Ref a.  The 
two confirmed that all links between Sega Dis Ticaret and 
al-Huda had been terminated, and that al-Huda is now working 
exclusively with the Ankara-based Kaptan company on the 
order.   They added that the information provided to us last 
week by Sega is out-of-date, and that in fact al-Huda is 
prepared to go forward with the contract without change in 
price or quantity.  What they need to proceed, however, is a 
green light from the Turkish Foreign Trade Undersecretariat, 
which they understand is contingent on that office receiving 
the go-ahead from the State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) 
in Baghdad.  Kahraman noted that their Dubai-based partner, 
Mr. Wadi Handal, has already been in contact with the CPA, 
but that to date SOMO has not provided the required 
notification to Ankara via the Turkish Commercial Attache in 
Baghdad.  They provided a copy of a September 21st letter

the CPA, requesting delivery of the order, which was 
addressed to SOMO, with information copies to al-Huda and the 
Iraqi Ministry of Trade. 
 
 
2.  Mujahed and Kahraman noted that the payment for the 
order, as well as for other items in the Turkey-Iraq protocol 
that was signed during State Minister Tuzman\'s trip, is 
currently in Halkbank, where it has been blocked at the 
direction of the Turkish government.  (They estimated the 
total amount at 200 million USD.)   They concurred with the 
information in the Thatcher letter that payment would follow 
delivery of the material to Iraqi Media Network (IMN) 
warehouses in Baghdad.  The two stressed that the equipment 
is not yet in place in Turkey, but will only be procured from 
Europe and Canada after the Turkish government gives them the 
go-ahead.  They estimated that ordering the material and 
delivering it to Baghdad would take six weeks to two months 
from that point.

1. (sbu) Summary: Following Ruling AK Party national congress 
(reftel), the Istanbul AK Party organization is gearing up 
vigorously at the grassroots level for next year\'s March 28 
municipal elections.  Not content merely to rely on the 
party\'s performance at the national level, the Istanbul AK 
Party organization\'s grassroots outreach campaign is already 
well under way.  Although no decision has been made on who 
will be the AK Party candidate for the Greater Istanbul 
Mayoralty, it now appears likely that Prime Minister and AK 
Party Chairman Tayyip Erdogan will pass over current 
independent Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna in favor of someone 
closer to him and the party.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (sbu) Continuing strong support in the greater urban 
sprawl for Tayyip Erdogan owing to his attention to city 
services and infrastructure during his 1994-1998 tenure as 
mayor;  the failure of the opposition CHP to reach the man in 
the street; the collapse of Cem Uzan\'s Genc Party\'s 
popularity (following the exposure of financial scandals and 
corruption in his family conglomerate), and the absence of 
any other rising political challenges make the AK Party the 
heavy favorite in the upcoming municipal elections in 
Istanbul.  Gurtuna\'s chances of being welcomed into the AK 
Party have always hinged on whether the party would need his 
name recognition to win the upcoming local elections and 
whether he and Erdogan could overcome their mutual antipathy. 
 It now appears to us that, rather than coopting Mayor 
Gurtuna, PM Erdogan will probably feel comfortable nominating 
a lesser known candidate to challenge him. 
 
 
3. (u) On October 26, AK invited 2,500 assorted artists, 
athletes, journalists, civil society leaders, and ordinary 
citizens as part of its grassroots outreach campaign under 
the \"AK Platform\"-banner.  PM Erdogan, Istanbul Province AK 
Chairman Muezzinoglu, and other assorted party luminaries 
listened to short speeches by attendees detailing their views 
on, and possible solutions to, Istanbul\'s problems (similar 
meetings have already been held in each of Istanbul\'s 32 
sub-provinces).  Much of the criticism was directed at the 
notably-absent Mayor Gurtuna and several speeches called on 
AK to challenge him in the upcoming elections.  President of 
the Artisans (Esnaflar) Chamber Suat Yalkin, for example, 
publicly praised Erdogan and AK and promised to support and 
endorse a mayoral candidate \"close to the Prime Minister.\" 
 
 
4. (c)  AK founding member Serap Yasar told poloff privately 
that there will be meetings in the coming weeks to discuss 
AK\'s mayoral candidate with a decision expected by November 
15.  Yasar was dismissive of Gurtuna\'s chances.  Istanbul 
Vice Chairman (and master of ceremony at the conference) 
Murat Yalcintas and another AK founding member Mukaddes 
Misiroglu later told poloff that they too saw Gurtuna\'s 
chances as slim, but \"never to say never\" in Turkish 
politics.  All agreed that the choice would ultimate come 
down to Party Chairman Erdogan himself. 
 
 
5. (u) Without criticizing the current mayor directly, PM 
Erdogan\'s speech remarked on the problems still facing the 
city, including uncontrolled migration and overcrowded 
classrooms.  Erdogan also promised to deliver public 
administration reform to give the local mayors and district 
mayors the authority to tackle problems locally.  President 
of the Independent Industrialists and Businessmen\'s 
Association (MUSIAD) Ali Bayramoglu touched on the same 
subject, saying that \"only Istanbul can solve Istanbul\'s 
problems\" (Note: Bayramoglu is often mentioned as a possible 
AK candidate for mayor). 
 
 
6. (c) In lengthy discussions with us, Muezzinoglu, 
Gaziosmanpasa sub-province chairman Subasi, and a group of 
leading party activists from Eyup sub-province also laid out 
the party\'s block-by-block structure, e.g., each polling 
booth neighborhood is canvassed door-to-door by a four-member 
team with a rep each from the party\'s women\'s and youth 
branches joining two more senior local reps.  Eyup reps added 
that they start each day as if the party is at zero percent 
rather than the 40%-45% level party polls indicate.  Noting 
that he monitors the provincial party activity through a 
regularized stream of reports up from the base, Muezzinoglu 
also underscored that no one is relaxing: his goal is to 
reach 51% of the vote in the elections. 
 
 
7. (c) Comment: Not content to rest on their laurels, the 
Istanbul AK Party organization is preparing to use the same 
successful electoral strategy they used last year: Party 
Chairman Erdogan\'s charisma combined with meticulous 
grassroots campaigning.  Carried out by tens of thousands of 
activists and volunteers, AK already has a clear jump on the 
competition in local campaigning and is not relaxing its 
pace.  Nothing is a foregone conclusion, however.  The choice 
of candidates is particularly important in municipal 
elections.  Moreover, while Erdogan\'s handpicked provincial 
chairman Muezzinoglu, a surgeon, is highly organized, he is 
relatively untested in the political arena.

local Christians.  Thus, Poloff noted, a trip to Cuba by the 
Patriarch could cause a wrinkle in the long-standing

issue with the Patriarchate, and would welcome further, more 
authoritative discussion of the issue either through the 
Consulate General in Istanbul or the Embassy in Ankara. 
Meliton took careful note of all this and said that he would 
be writing a memo to the Patriarch immediately, and would 
have a response from the Patriarch no later than November 4. 
He said, however, the Patriarch would not want to do anything 
to harm our relationship.  Though Bartholomew had agreed

SUBJECT: KURDISH LANGUAGE NUDGES INTO PRIME TIME 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: In a small sign that Turkey\'s EU reforms 
are beginning to have some impact, Kurdish singer Ciwan Haco 
performed on a popular prime time television show on October 
25.  The show\'s host, Hulya Avsar, herself half-Kurdish, took 
pains to strike a balance between Turkish patriotism and 
Kurdish cultural expression.  Despite initial hesitation by 
the television station, Haco interviewed only in Kurmanji 
(the most widely spoken Kurdish language in Turkey), using a 
translator.  While no major milestone in linguistic freedom, 
the 15-minute performance and interview suggests there may be 
greater room to maneuver on \"mother tongue\" issues in the 
future.  End Summary. 
 
 
Hulya and the Show 
------------------ 
 
 
2. (U) Actress/singer Hulya Avsar\'s eponymous show featured a 
rarity in Turkish broadcasting on October 25: Kurdish singing 
and discussion.  Avsar, a native of Edremit, is the daughter 
of a Kurdish father and Turkish mother.  Her highly-rated 
show, sponsored by British retailers Marks & Spencer, is 
popular with youth of both sexes, and some middle-aged Turks. 
 The show airs on Saturday evenings at 11pm on a major 
Istanbul-based station, Kanal D. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Kanal D producers sought to soften the impact of 
inviting a Kurdish pop star to perform on the show.  Poloff 
learned from Haco\'s translator, who also appeared on the 
show, that the program executives initially asked Haco to 
talk with Avsar in English.  Haco (a Syrian-born Kurd who 
lives in Norway and speaks fluent English) refused, saying 
that he was a Kurd and wished to perform and speak in 
Kurmanji.  Poloff contacts opined that Haco\'s status as a 
citizen of another country may have made it easier to get 
Kurmanji past nervous television executives. 
 
 
Elderly Counter-balance 
----------------------- 
 
 
4. (U) Ultimately, Haco\'s wishes prevailed, but his 
appearance was preceded by a short interview with a 
105-year-old Turkish veteran of the Turkish War of 
Independence.  The feisty vet (who brought his bayonet with 
him and discussed the three Greeks he killed with it) talked 
of letting Ataturk drink water from his hands, and was a 
clear counterweight to Haco\'s Kurmanji performance. 
 
 
5. (U) Following the elderly veteran, Haco was introduced and 
began by conversing with Avsar in Kurmanji.  Avsar, after 
somewhat nervously saying that she was in fact partially 
Kurdish, spoke little herself, but recognized and used 
several basic phrases.  (Note: Older Turks with whom poloff 
spoke said this was not the first time Hulya had taken some 
risks professionally.  Avsar once publicly defended Ibrahim 
Tatlises, an icon of Turkish arabesk music who at one time 
was banned by the government.  End note.)  Two Kurmanji songs 
by Haco followed the interview. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
6. (SBU) To date, post is not aware of any press reaction to 
the Kurdish performance.  Use of a \"mother tongue\" language, 
even briefly, without major outcry, is a small step forward. 
The true litmus test, however, will be the introduction of 
regular \"mother tongue\" broadcasting, something which was 
legalized as part of the 2002 EU reforms, but which has yet 
to be implemented.  End comment.

SUBJECT: POSSIBLE EDUCATION MINISTRY MOVEMENT ON HALKI? 
 
 
REF: ISTANBUL 1347 
 
 
Classified By: A/CG Stuart Smith for reason 1.4 (d). 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Recent encouraging comments by Turkish 
government officials about prospects for re-opening Halki 
Theological Seminary have sparked extensive press interest. 
Education Minister Huseyin Celik, in a recent meeting with 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, said that re-opening Halki 
(possibly as a theological technical school) is long overdue 
and would be good for the development of Turkish democracy. 
The Greek Orthodox Community, while optimistic, is not 
holding its breath.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) On October 30, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew met 
with National Education Minister Huseyin Celik to discuss the 
status of the Halki Seminary on Heybeli Island, outside 
Istanbul.  Patriarchate sources were very pleased by Celik\'s 
\"positive outlook,\" but said that no concrete steps for the 
re-opening of Halki (which has been closed since 1971) were 
taken. 
 
 
3. (C) According to Metropolitan Meliton of Philadelphia, the 
idea to re-designate Halki as a part of the Theological 
Faculty of Istanbul University is now not being seriously 
considered.  Instead, he said, Halki may be re-opened as a 
private theological \"technical school.\"  Questions remain as 
to whether Halki would be allowed to administer a four-year 
course of study, or would be limited to only one year. 
Meliton said the Patriarchate would be willing to discuss 
this point further. 
 
 
4. (U) Following the meeting with Bartholomew, Celik made a 
statement to the press that \"the issue of the seminary on 
Heybeli Island has been on the agenda for 32 years, and 
doesn\'t need to be protracted any longer.\"  Further, he said, 
\"having a free education in Christian theology is a necessary 
part of the democratic structure of the Turkish state.\"  All 
major press coverage of the meeting was positive. 
 
 
5. (C) In a separate meeting, Yavuz Onen, Human Rights 
Foundation President (protect), said that he believes nothing 
new is happening, and that Celik\'s press statements were 
intended as positive human rights publicity for the EU\'s 
benefit.  Onen has been involved in discussions on the status 
of Halki for many years. 
 
 
6. (C) Comment: The Patriarchate hears good things from all 
AK Party ministers they\'ve met with.  While the meetings 
indicate a more open-minded attitude to the issue in the 
Erdogan government, to date the government has not followed 
words with action, and reaction from the Kemalist core has 
been unremittingly harsh and xenophobic.  Moreover, our 
attempts to find anyone in the Education Ministry in Ankara 
who is responsible for what Celik said would be a commission 
to study the way ahead have gone for nought. 
 
 
7. (C) Additionally, the Patriarchate told us that, in their 
August meeting, PM Erdogan implied to Bartholomew that, in 
return for opening Halki, he might expect some quid pro quo 
from Greece with regard to the treatment of the Turkish 
minority in Thrace and/or the long-delayed opening of a 
mosque in Athens (a linkage that the Patriarchate rejects). 
We are continuing to press GoT and AK Party officials for 
clarification of Celik\'s statement and the GoT\'s intent.  End 
comment.

SUBJECT: REACTION MUTED TO NEW PENSION OPPORTUNITIES 
 
 
 1.  Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet 
distribution. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Summary: Turkey\'s new private pension system was 
unveiled with much fanfare at the end of October, with 
optimistic prognosticators predicting that up to 10 million 
Turks will enroll over the next decade.  Initially six 
companies are offering private pension plans, with another 
six waiting to be licensed.  Boosters trumpet the system as 
one that will enable workers to maintain their standard of 
living in retirement, while also providing an important 
source of long-term financing for Turkish economic 
development.  Sceptics argue, however, that the new system 
differs little from previously existing private pensions that 
were offered by life insurance companies, and that with only 
a modest increase in incentives for participation the system 
will be hard pressed to achieve its ambitious goals.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
3. (U) High-profile Rollout: Turkey\'s new and improved 
private pension system received a high profile rollout last 
week, with industry executives reporting extensive interest 
from the public.  Designed to supplement Turkey\'s existing 
public social security net, the system enables workers to put 
money in a variety of funds linked to different investment 
vehicles, including the stock market and government 
securities.  Initially, six companies (Ak, Anadolu, Garanti, 
Oyak and Yapi Kredi Emeklilik) are licensed to participate in 
the system, all affiliated with major Turkish banks and 
insurance companies.  An additional six companies, including 
firms affiliated with the Dogan and Koc groups expect to 
receive their licenses in the next few weeks.  Each firm 
offers between 5 and 9 different funds, and requires a 
minimum monthly contribution that can be as little as 25 
dollars or 40 million TL. 
 
 
4. (U) Rules/Incentives: In contrast to previously existing 
private pensions in Turkey, which were offered by life 
insurance companies, the new plan gives enhanced flexibility 
in some areas, but takes away in others.  Contributors will 
now be able to switch their investments between participating 
companies and within each company among its various 
investment funds.  But contributors must also pay into the 
system for at least 10 years and reach the age of 56 before 
they are able to take money out without penalty, in contrast 
to the existing scheme where only the ten year rule applies. 
Beyond the fifteen percent tax that participants will face on 
early withdrawal, sceptics also note that the new system\'s 
incentives, while enhanced from the previous system, remain 
modest.  The maximum tax credit on contributions is 10 
percent of a contributor\'s income (to a maximum of Turkey\'s 
minimum wage, currently 180 USD/month), up from 5 percent 
under the old system.  In place of the 10 percent tax on 
benefits under the old system for those meeting the age and 
contribution thresholds, the rate is cut to 5 percent. 
Investment advisors nonetheless argue that workers who invest 
10 percent of their income for 20 years will be able to 
maintain their standard of living in retirement, though of 
course there are no guarantees for how the various funds will 
perform. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Outlook: Publicly, at least, fund organizers predict 
that 8 to 10 million workers, or between a third and a half 
of those officially registered as workers in the Turkish 
economy will elect to participate in the system in the next 
10 years.  Ak Emeklilik, which is affiliated with AK Bank, 
Turkey\'s leading financial insitution, has publicly targeted 
a 10 percent market share, with 50,000 clients and 300 
million USD in assets in the first year alone.  Privately, 
however, other industry executives predict that industry\'s 
takeoff will be more gradual.  Garanti Emeklilik Chairman 
Aclan Acar, for instance, noted that his firm will not hire 
new staff or open special branches, but will instead simply 
use existing bank and insurance company offices to sell the 
product.  He noted that his son, a financial analyst, had 
reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of the system, and 
concluded that despite the incentives, investing in a mutual 
fund is more advantageous, given its flexibility and the 
absence of penalties for early withdrawal.  Without further 
incentives, Acar predicted, enrollments will likely lag 
behind industry expectations, so that he expects that without 
changes enrollments will only reach 2 million or so, rather 
than the hoped-for 10 million. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: Despite the caveats, the new retirement 
scheme does offer the potential to draw some additional 
resources into Turkish financial markets.  In a country where 
most bank liabilities are extremely short term, and mismatch 
even with year-long government securities, any longer term 
instruments are a welcome development.  But rapid growth in 
the sector is likely to be constrained not just by the 
relatively modest incentives the new system offers, but also 
by the continuing lag in real wage growth, which leaves most 
Turkish workers with relatively little savings to devote to 
such purposes.  End comment.

SUBJECT: GEBZE INDUSTRY SEES AWAKENING ECONOMY 
 
 1.  Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet 
distribution. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Summary: Industrialists in the Marmara region 
industrial town of Gebze told visiting P/E Section Chief and 
Poloff that recent positive economic developments are finally 
beginning to be felt at their level, and that they are fairly 
bullish on the region\'s economic prospects.  While exports 
remain the primary engine of economic growth (though they 
have been hurt by low profit margins as a result of the 
strong Turkish lira), our interlocutors reported that they 
are beginning to see a pickup in domestic demand as well.  As 
a result, all firms reported a significant increase in 
employment over the last eight months, with most increasing 
their long-frozen workforces by 20-30 percent.  A number of 
problems continue to cloud the business horizon, however, 
with high energy prices, high taxes, and unfair competition 
from the informal sector topping the list.  Gebze businessmen 
give the AK government high marks for its initial year, 
commenting that it is among the most \"business friendly\" 
governments they have seen.  End summary. 
 
 
3. (SBU) An Industrial Center: An important center in the 
industrial heartland of Turkey\'s Marmara region, Gebze is a 
short 40 kilometers outside of the Istanbul city center, with 
convenient highway, rail and sea connections to Central Asia, 
the Middle East and Europe.  Local business officials proudly 
point to the area\'s dynamic industrial sector, which now 
accounts for 13 percent of Turkey\'s industrial production. 
During an October 30 day trip to the region organized in 
conjunction with the Gebze Industrialists and Businessmens\' 
Association (GESIAD), P/E Chief and Poloff toured a number of 
industrial facilities, ranging from low-tech flooring and 
wood products production, to more high-tech production of 
automobile radiators, automotive glass, and copper tubing. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Exports and domestic demand: All the firms we 
visited reported a sharp uptick in demand, which had prompted 
them to expand employment over the last 9 months.  Kale Oto 
Radyator, for instance, noted that its work force had grown 
by 50 percent to approximately 200 people, while Sarkuysan, a 
manufacturer of copper wire and tubing and one of Turkey\'s 
leading industrial success stories, noted that employment has 
increased 30 percent to 450 employees.  Turkey\'s recent 
export boom explains the companies\' success, both directly 
and indirectly.  Kale, for instance, supplies 95 percent of 
the radiators used in the Turkish automotive industry, so 
that while its sales are largely domestic, they form part of 
a sector that has played a key role in leading Turkish 
exports to record levels this year.  Olimpia Oto Camlari 
Sanayi and Ticaret, a leading auto glass manufacturer, has 
benefited similarly, though it does not dominate its market 
to the same extent.  Sarkuysan, meanwhile, enjoys a dominant 
local market share while also exporting half of its output. 
Domestic producers are also seeing an uptick in demand, 
though Yongapan Wooden Products General Manager Azem Gungor 
noted that his Turkish market is largely saturated, so the 
firm is currently focusing more on overseas opportunities and 
expanding its factories in Bulgaria and Romania and looking 
to open a new operation in Bosnia. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Familiar Concerns: Gebze businessmen echoed 
traditional complaints about Turkey\'s relatively unfriendly 
business environment, pointing especially to concerns about 
high Turkish energy prices.  Two of the firms we visited, 
Sarkuysan and Yongapan, produce much of their own energy, but 
high natural gas prices and the high cost of electricity for 
the 20 percent of their energy needs they buy on the open 
market crimp profits.  Sarkuysan VP Sevgur Arslanpay listed 
high energy prices as a major obstacle to his firm\'s 
international competitiveness and their single biggest 
complaint about the local business environment.  Gungor 
pointed to sector specific problems: the high cost of forest 
products, which he said were three times the level of 
neighboring countries, largely because of government control 
of forests.  While logistics and the weight of many of its 
products shield Yongapan from international competition, the 
difficulties have led the company to focus its expansion more 
on its foreign than its domestic operations. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Informal Economy: Among other complaints were high 
tax rates, including the lack of inflation accounting (which 
the government has promised to implement next year), which 
can lead to diminution of a company\'s capital, and the 
difficulty in raising financing (most of our Gebze 
interlocutors pointed to self-financing as the major source 
of their funds-- only Kale noted that it has historically 
been able to secure bank financing at very low rates, perhaps 
stemming from its market dominance in an export-oriented 
industry).  Lower tech companies also complained about unfair 
competition from companies that operate in the shadows, 
avoiding payment of labor and other taxes.  For companies 
like Sarkuysan, which require extensive investment and high 
tech processes, however, this is not an issue. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Plaudits: Gebze businessmen were largely 
complimentary about the new Turkish government, crediting it 
with a more business-friendly attitude than its predecessors, 
and arguing that the results of the past year show its 
competence in addressing economic issues.  As one would 
expect from members of an industrialists\' organization close 
to Islamic spiritual leader Fethullah Gulen, the businessmen 
we spoke to appeared pious.  Likewise, as one would expect 
from businessmen representing not only Gulenist but, more 
broadly, Anatolian values, several criticized President 
Sezer\'s decision not to invite the head-scarved wives of AK 
parliamentarians to his independence day reception.  Kale 
President Celal Kaya even expressed support for the 
government\'s plans to dispatch Turkish soldiers to Iraq 
(\"necessary,\" he said, \"to protect the Turkmen\" and to 
dissuade the Kurds from forming their own state).  There was 
some concern that AK\'s handling of the imam-hatip (preacher) 
schools and higher education council reform was clumsy and 
untimely, but overall our interlocutors judged AK\'s moderate 
face to be sincere, and expressed hope that it would continue 
to focus on the economy rather than other issues. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: If these companies are an indicative 
sample, exports may turn out to be the engine that pulls 
Turkey out of the lingering effects of the 2001 economic 
crisis.  Each of the companies we visited has been making 
serious investments in production capacity, often by 
purchasing foreign equipment, as well as by hiring more 
workers, holding out the prospect of a pick-up in local 
demand.  The view of politics from this industrial heartland 
is that this government has scored big points by taking steps 
to stabilize the economy and improve the business 
environment.  AK will continue to enjoy widespread support 
here as long as fixing the economy remains their top priority. 
 
 
9. (SBU) Behind the scenes wrangling that preceded the trip 
also set in bold relief the odd mixture of xenophobia and 
openness to world markets that can characterize Turkish 
business.  We learned from Mustafa Gunay, whose Business Life 
Association (ISHAD) worked with its affiliate GESIAD to 
organize the program, that one company was hostile to the 
planned visit, fearing that we represented American companies 
that wanted to either steal his \"cutting-edge\" technology or 
buy it out from under him cheaply.  Gunay responded by asking 
what century he was living in, and stressing the need for 
mid-sized Turkish companies to reach out to and cooperate 
with foreign partners.  The exchange highlights the public 
relations benefit of showing the flag in outlying industrial 
districts, and we plan to follow-up by organizing a \"Doing 
Business with the U.S.\" program early next year in 
cooperation with GESIAD.

TWENTY PEOPLE 
 
Classified By: Consul General David L. Arnett for reason 1.4 (d). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: It\'s hard to be a patriarch with a tiny 
domain.  Recently-enthroned Turkish Orthodox Patriarch Pasa 
Umit Erenerol is the third Patriarch of a \"church\" that dates 
its founding back to 1922 and the heat of a civil war. 
Today, the patriarch\'s writ goes no further than his extended 
family, though the fact of his patriarchal status allows the 
family to hold on to three church buildings claimed by the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate.  Ultra-nationalist elements of the 
Turkish establishment continue to see the microscopic church 
as a foil to its Ecumenical rival.  End Summary. 
 
 
A Short History of Turkish Orthodoxy 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
2. (U) In 1922, Turkey and Greece were in the midst of a 
pitched battle for national survival, fighting town-to-town 
through western Anatolia amidst an ethnically-mixed 
population.  In Kayseri, an ethnic Greek, Pavli (later \"Papa\" 
or Pope) Eftim, gathered 72 priests and other Orthodox 
followers to the banner of Mustafa Kemal\'s Turkish 
Nationalists and rejected the leadership of the Ecumenical 
Patriarch.  In 1924, Papa Eftim and some of his followers 
occupied the Ecumenical Patriarchate at Fener for a time. 
Later that year, Fener was returned to the Ecumenical 
Patriarch, reportedly at the request of the Turkish 
government.  Still, three churches (all in the Beyoglu 
district of Istanbul) were awarded to Papa Eftim, and he was 
installed as Patriarch of a new Turkish Orthodox Church. 
 
 
Master of His Domain 
-------------------- 
 
 
3. (U) Eftim\'s community, once numbering in the thousands, 
gradually dropped away through a combination of old age and 
immigration to Europe and elsewhere.  He and his American 
wife had a son, Selcuk Erenerol, who took over the 
Patriarchate after his death.  Pasa Umit Erenerol was named 
Patriarch after Selcuk Erenerol\'s death earlier this year. 
According to Sevgi Erenerol, his sister, the Patriarch leads 
approximately 20 people who attend one of three churches 
(Panayia Church, the Patriarchal seat), as the other two are 
badly burned and in need of renovation, respectively. 
According to Sevgi Erenerol, the 20 people are members of 
three families. 
 
 
4. (U) The current patriarch has no formal religious 
training, though he was \"raised in church,\" according to 
Sevgi Erenerol.  The Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate has no 
regular contact with any other national Orthodox Church, by 
their own admission.  There are no other ordained clergy in 
the church.  The church has no foundations or property other 
than the three church buildings.  However, the economic 
situation of the Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate is good, 
\"thanks to the support of the state,\" according to Erenerol. 
 
 
A Foil to Fener 
--------------- 
 
 
5. (C) The Patriarchal offices are covered with evidence of 
Turkish nationalist sentiment.  Photos, busts, and sayings of 
Ataturk are everywhere.  A map of Central Asia hangs over the 
door, with the faces of Ataturk, Mehmet the Conqueror, and 
Genghis Khan superimposed.  The nationalist pedigree of the 
church is impeccable; at the enthronement ceremony for the 
current Patriarch, MHP representatives sat next to the Mufti 
for the Muslim minority in Greek Thrace, \"TRNC\" 
representatives, and spouses of people killed by the PKK. 
Property issues aside, ultra-nationalist elements of the 
establishment continue to see the church as a useful foil to 
the ambitions of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and more 
generally Greece. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
6. (C) The Turkish Orthodox Church, a microscopic community 
within the already-small Orthodox minority in Turkey, gains 
mention only by virtue of competing property claims with the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate.  Selcuk Erenerol was, before his 
death, famous for his invective against the Ecumenical 
Patriarch and \"foreign interests\" in Turkey.  To date, Pasa 
Umit Erenerol has not made any major public statements.  It 
remains to be seen if ultra-nationalists will continue to 
find use for the diminutive church in the future.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL SYNAGOGUES BOMBED 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
 
1. (u) Bombs detonated simultaneously at two of the major 
Jewish synagogues in Istanbul at approximately 9:30 am have 
claimed dozens of lives and injured over a hundred people. 
Based on observations by the Consul General, RSO, and poloffs 
at both sites, it appears that both buildings were targeted 
by vehicle bombs.  Damage was extensive, cars on the streets 
were destroyed, storefronts ruined, and glass windows 
shattered blocks away.  Consulate employees felt the shock 
from one of the explosions at their residence about a 
kilometer and a half away.  Early reports indicate that at 
least 23 people have been killed and over a hundred wounded, 
although it is likely that the numbers will continue to rise. 
 
 
2. (u) One of the sites was the Sisli Beth Israel synagogue, 
one of the community\'s most active.  The Chief Rabbi, the 
President of the Jewish Community, and 60 other dignitaries 
were at the site when the explosion occurred for a ceremony 
to commemorate the completion of a restoration project. 
Members of the Jewish Community Board who were also at the 
site reported to us that the Chief Rabbi and the President of 
the Community escaped unharmed, but at least a dozen people 
were killed, including by-standers and security personnel. 
 
 
3. (u) The other site was Neve Shalom synagogue, another of 
the community\'s main synagogues and the site of a 1986 
machine-gun and grenade attack by Abu Nidal that claimed 20 
lives.  Although not heavily-used for normal Sabbath 
services, it is the primary site for special occasions, and 
today\'s explosion took place during a bar mitzvah ceremony 
attended by 400 people.  Police on the scene told the CG that 
the bomb was carried by a small truck and that at least 10 
people were killed.  CG observed a large crater in front of 
the main entrance.  Fortunately, extensive security measures 
at the site appear to have limited the damage to the front 
section of the building, away from the main hall.  People 
attending the religious services were able to exit the 
building through a rear entrance. 
 
 
4. (c) It is too soon to say who might have conducted the 
attacks.  We have heard one report that IBDA-C (Islamic Great 
Eastern Raiders), a small and relatively inactive terrorist 
group, phoned the Anatolian news agency to claim 
responsibity.  Our assessment of this group\'s capabilities, 
however, suggests that they would be unable to conduct such 
an attack.  The Minister of Interior also told the Ambassador 
that these attacks do not fit the pattern of the PKK, DHKP-C, 
MLKP, or any of the local groups whose activities they track 
closely. 
 
 
5. (u) We have no reports so far that any American citizens 
were killed or injured at either site.  We are in touch with 
local hospitals to ensure that we are notified promptly if 
any Americans are brought in.  We did speak with one 
uninjured Amcit, Rabbi Mendy Chitrik, who was at the 
Ashkenzai synagogue, not far from Neve Shalom, at the time of 
the explosion. 
 
 
5. (c) Action Request: The Ambassador has expressed the 
condolences of the USG and offers of assistance to the 
Minister of Interior, the Foreign Ministry, and the Israeli 
Embassy; the CG has conveyed them to the Israeli CG and 
leadership of the Jewish community.  Because there are 
indications that this might be the work of international 
terrorist groups, post requests that we be authorized to 
offer FBI assistance to the Turkish authorities to assist 
them in their investigations.

rights activists recently being arrested and sentenced to 28 
years in prison;  Castro\'s statement that he plans to remain 
President for life; many limits to religious freedom and 
human rights in Cuba; the probable exploitation of the 
Patriarch\'s trip by the Castro regime for propaganda purposes. 
 
 
3. (C) Bartholomew responded as follows: 
 
 
-USG opinion is important to Ecumenical Patriarchate and to 
me personally. 
 
 
-However, it would be difficult for me not to go to Cuba: the 
visit has been formally announced by Archbishop of Central 
America Athenogoras; the Cuban government gave us both land 
and material aid; and the Cuban government has recognized the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate\'s leadership of Orthodox believers in 
the Cuban state. 
 
 
-Russian Orthodox Metropolitan Kirill, director of their 
external affairs, had been working for some time to obtain 
such recognition from Cuba, without success. 
 
 
-Many Amcits plan to be in Cuba for the visit, including 
Archbishop Demetrios of the United States.  Such attendees 
must be going with the permission, or at least the knowledge, 
of the USG. 
 
 
-I can use this opportunity to raise the issue of human 
rights with Castro, and I will do so.  Though I understand 
your concerns about Castro\'s use of my visit for his own 
political ends, he did not do so with the visit of the Pope, 
who is a more widely-recognized personality than I am.  Why 
would he use me? 
 
 
4. (C) Consul General commented that the major change between 
the Pope\'s prior visit and the Patriarch\'s planned visit is 
the crack down on dissidents in 2003.  75 people are now in 
deplorable prison conditions, seen as prisoners of conscience 
by Amnesty International and many others.  Many countries 
have suspended high-level relations and cultural exchanges 
with the Castro regime.  We are trying to send the message to 
Castro that it is not just \"business-as-usual\" after this 
human rights violation.  (NOTE: the Patriarch did not appear 
aware that all of the 75 prisoners were still in prison and 
serving 28-year sentences.) 
 
 
5. (C) Bartholomew responded that he would undertake to bring 
the subject of these prisoners into conversations with Castro 
in private, and would urge that they be released. 
Bartholomew pointed out that he had done something similar in 
a prior visit to Libya, working closely with Bulgarian 
Ambassadors and MFA to push for the release of Bulgarian 
scholars.  \"You can trust me to use this opportunity to bring 
up these issues,\" he said.  \"I don\'t have the right to give 
up this opportunity for recognition of the Orthodox Church.\" 
 
 
6. (C) Consul General asked whether there was a possibility 
of downgrading the representation of the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate in Cuba, sending someone else in the place of 
the Patriarch.  Bartholomew replied that \"the trip has 
already been decided upon and announced.  Metropolitan 
Athenogoras of Central America announced my planned travel to 
Cuba and Haiti (which I will be going to for one day). 
Athenogoras will soon be in Istanbul, and I will have him 
come to the U.S. Consulate General to discuss the background 
for this trip and his feelings on the Cuban government.\" 
 
 
7. (C) COMMENT: The driving force for this whole undertaking 
seems to be Bartholomew\'s interest in beating the Russian 
Orthodox Church to the punch.  Bartholomew\'s tone, however, 
seemed to indicate that he was pleading for our understanding 
with regard to the corner he had painted himself into (with 
the assistance of Metropolitan Athenogoras).  We recognize 
that intra-Orthodox competition with the Russians is key to 
the future of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.  However, in 
agreeing to make this trip,  Bartholomew has not taken into 
full account the political implications, especially as they 
relate to human rights in Cuba, or his relationship with the 
USG.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
8. (C) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests that Department confirm 
with Metropolitan Demetrios that he plans to travel to Cuba. 
If so, Post would appreciate a read-out of his thinking and 
information on any other high-level Greek-American leaders 
traveling with him.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL REACTS TO SYNAGOGUE BOMBINGS 
 
 
REF: ISTANBUL 1703 
 
 
1. (sbu) Summary: Istanbul is still stunned by the shock and 
horror of Saturday\'s synagogue bombings.  The overwhelming 
response has been to view this as a senseless and 
unjustifiable attack, not merely against Turkey\'s small 
Jewish community, but against Turkey itself.  Despite 
widespread speculation and uncertainty about possible 
perpetrators and motives, the general consensus among our 
contacts is that the attacks are unlikely to have a 
significant impact either on Turkish domestic politics or 
foreign policy.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (u) An Attack Against All Turks: The casualty figures from 
the synagogue bombings now indicate that 23 people were 
killed and over 300 wounded (reftel).  Only 6 of those killed 
were members of the Jewish community, although community 
officials tell us that one other member remains in critical 
condition.  Chief Rabbi Isak Haleva himself was lightly 
injured on one hand and his son suffered more serious wounds 
to his face.  Although the synagogues and the Jewish 
community were clearly the intended target, most Turks with 
whom we have spoken feel that the attacks were simply attacks 
against Turkey.  Noting that most of the victims were Muslim 
bystanders and security personnel, men-on-the-street condemn 
the senseless violence and express solidarity with their 
Jewish fellow citizens.  The Jewish community, living under 
constant terrorist threats, was horrified by the scale of the 
attacks, but not particularly surprised by the attacks 
themselves. 
 
 
3. (u) Government Responds: Turkish officials have responded 
quickly to the attacks.  Accompanied by several ministers, 
Prime Minister Erdogan toured the damaged synagogues, visited 
victims in the hospitals, and made a courtesy call on Chief 
Rabbi Haleva and the community leadership.  The Prime 
Minister has been widely quoted as vowing to find the 
perpetrators of the attacks and to \"continue fighting 
terrorism in the international arena.\" Investigators have 
taken control of the sites, gathered evidence, and are 
following up on the available leads.  The press reported, for 
example, that a few suspects had been taken into custody, but 
later reported that these suspects have since been released. 
 
 
4. (u) Investigation: Although the investigations are still 
in the early phases, many think that the attacks were 
instigated from abroad.  Press reports indicate that an 
Al-Qaeda-affiliated group has claimed credit for the attacks. 
 Authorities are now more or less convinced that each attack 
was carried out by suicide bombers using small trucks with 
fake license plates carrying 300-400 kilograms of explosives. 
 It remains unclear to what degree local actors may have been 
involved in the planning and execution of the attacks.  Most 
Turks remain puzzled about the possible motives for such an 
attack, but most of the speculation focuses on possible anger 
directed against Turkey\'s close relationship with Israel and 
the U.S. and its complicity with regard to the volatile 
situations in Iraq and the Palestinian territories. 
 
 
5. (sbu) Impact on Turkish Politics: Noted political experts 
are waiting to see what impact the bombings will have on the 
government\'s policies.  Cengiz Candar, columnist for Tercuman 
daily newspaper, told poloff that it is too soon to say for 
sure whether the attacks will have a long-term impact.  He 
noted that it will be important to see to what extent 
domestic groups or organizations were involved in the 
attacks.  Candar commented, however, that if the motive was 
to drive a wedge between Turkey and Israel, it may well have 
the opposite effect.  Ismet Berkan, editor and columnist for 
Radikal daily newspaper, said that he doesn\'t see any 
likelihood that the bombings will create domestic problems 
for the government or affect the general direction of its 
policies.  Sabanci University Professor Ali Carkoglu was more 
concerned, noting that anti-AK elements may try to use any 
links uncovered with domestic Islamic extremists to attack 
the government.  He added that public support for 
Turkish-Israeli relations was always \"thin\" at best; more 
such attacks could prompt criticism and a public debate on 
the subject. 
 
 
6. (sbu) Comment: Some are already postulating absurd 
MOSSAD/CIA conspiracy theories.  Others are using the attacks 
to criticize Turkey\'s relationships with Israel and the U.S. 
It will be impossible to convince purveyors of these views to 
change.  However, investigators and others in decision-making 
positions appear to accept that Al-Qaeda or some similar 
terrorist group has targeted Turkey.  This is not the first 
time, of course, that Turkey has been the victim of terrorist 
attacks, but it does bring the U.S.-led \"war on terror\" a lot 
closer to home.

SUBJECT: DUZCE: BLESSED BY NATURE, CURSED BY NATURE 
 
 
1. (sbu) Summary: On November 12-13, the fourth anniversary 
of a major earthquake, Poloff visited Duzce, a small Black 
Sea province halfway between Istanbul and Ankara. 
Impoverished by natural disasters and cruel circumstances, 
Duzce is Turkey\'s newest province and has placed its trust in 
the Justice and Development (AK) Party, hopeful that Prime 
Minister Erdogan and his government can deliver it from 
misfortune.  Judging by the concurrent visits by AKP 
ministers and their reception in Duzce, the government 
appears to be attentive to local concerns, even if there may 
ultimately be limits on how responsive they can be.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (sbu) Poloff visited Duzce on the fourth anniversary of 
the 1999 earthquake that killed 782 people, devastated the 
city center, destroying or damaging most of the buildings in 
the area.  The Duzce quake came just three months after the 
nearby, more-destructive Izmit/Adapazari earthquake that also 
caused significant local damage in Duzce.  As a result of the 
earthquakes and the devastation, a political decision was 
made to elevate the Duzce district to become Turkey\'s 81st 
province.  A governor and staff were appointed to oversee 
provincial reconstruction and management.  Asked whether the 
new status had brought tangible benefits to Duzce, Mayor Ruhi 
Kurnaz told poloff that it had brought additional burdens, 
including the costs of building offices for the governor and 
all of the provincial bureaucrats.  Local citizens largely 
agreed. 
 
 
3. (sbu) Locals claim that following the earthquakes and 
other developments (see below) Duzce went from being modestly 
affluent to impoverished and needy.  Although the Ecevit 
government, with international assistance, built entire new 
neighborhoods of modern apartment blocks for the earthquake 
victims, the construction process was tainted by corruption 
and has left many disappointed.  The 7,500 new apartments 
were designated only for land-owners who lost property. 
Those who lost multiple properties still received only one 
unit per person.  Those who rented apartments that were 
damaged or destroyed received nothing.  The ultimate cost to 
the new apartment owners is still unclear and none has been 
given formal deeds to new property. 
 
 
Political Outlook 
----------------- 
4. (sbu) With a predominantly conservative and traditional 
population of about 300,000, Duzce has tended to vote for 
center-right and right-wing political parties.  Home to a 
number of different Caucasian peoples, Duzce has one of 
Turkey\'s largest Cherkez populations (estimated at 50,000 by 
the local Cherkez Foundation), in addition to large numbers 
of Adagians, Abkhazians, and Laz.  Duzce residents are oddly 
proud of the national stereotype that portrays them as 
gun-toting \"tough guys\" (Note: Muhammed Tokcan, a 
Turkish-Chechen from Duzce, is famous (and sometimes admired) 
for his hijacking of a Black Sea ferry and hostage-taking in 
the Istanbul Swissotel to protest Russia\'s military actions 
against Chechnya). 
 
 
5. (sbu) Pointing proudly to the fact that in the 2002 
general elections Duzce gave AK 53 percent of the vote (one 
of its best provinces nationwide), AK Party provincial 
chairman Saim Tut told poloff he is confident that the party 
continues to make inroads with the public.  A former Duzce 
AKP founding member (now a village muhtar, or elected leader) 
begrudgingly admitted that he and other older members (who 
had signed on when nobody was interested in AKP) had been 
voted off the board this year in favor of \"new, young blood.\" 
 The CHP provincial and district chairmen, meanwhile, 
displayed to poloff a stunning lack of vision and energy 
(declaring themselves pleased with \"doubling\" their votes to 
8 percent in 2002), a total disconnect on political issues 
with the local populace, and a fundamentally flawed 
understanding of Turkey\'s IMF program and economic crisis. 
Mayor Kurnaz (a member of Saadet Party and a passionate 
support of party chairman Erbakan) confided to poloff that he 
does not intend to run in the upcoming March 28 local 
elections (Note: A number of local contacts indicated that 
Kurnaz would be unlikely to win reelection against a strong 
AKP candidate). 
 
 
Land of Plenty... 
----------------- 
6. (sbu) Duzce has some of the most productive agricultural 
land in Turkey.  Blessed with abundant water supplies and 
rich soil, locals boast that they can grow \"anything,\" and 
many non-farmers supplement their income by cultivating small 
plots on their property.  The local economy is dominated by 
agriculture, which, in turn, is dominated by hazelnuts, 
accounting for anywhere between 10 and 30 percent of Turkey\'s 
total production.  The President of the Agricultural Chamber 
estimated that at least 40,000 people work in the 
agricultural sector.  In addition to hazelnuts, Duzce 
produces significant amounts of tobacco, corn, and cattle. 
Until the mid-1990s, Duzce was also home to over 600 firms 
specializing in wood products, including parquet and paneling. 
 
 
But What the Lord Giveth, He can Taketh Away... 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
7. (sbu) Years before the two major earthquakes in 1999, 
Duzce was struck by the decimation of its wood industry.  A 
combination of dwindling forests and increasing labor costs 
left the local industry unable to stand up to Bulgarian 
competition.  Over the period of a few years, all but a dozen 
or so of the 600 firms have gone bankrupt or moved their 
production facilities to Bulgaria and other countries.  Hasan 
Demir, the owner of one such company, Aslan Forest Products, 
explained to poloff that he had no choice but to move to 
Bulgaria, where his brother now manages the profitable firm 
which exports the bulk of their products back to Turkey. 
Thousands of workers who lost jobs in this sector have yet to 
be picked up by new firms. 
 
 
8. (sbu) Ironically, one of the main obstacles to new 
investment, according to almost everyone we spoke to, is the 
excellent local water supplies.  In the early 1990s, faced 
with severe water shortages, then-Istanbul Mayor Tayyip 
Erdogan launched a billion dollar project to build a pipeline 
to bring drinking water from the Greater Melek River in Duzce 
to Istanbul.  With the project now well under way, in order 
to protect the future Istanbul water supply, national 
authorities now insist that companies building new facilities 
in Duzce meet strict and costly environmental standards. 
Duzce locals are convinced that the new standards are driving 
away potential investors.  Bulent Samli, the General Manager 
of an Ingersoll-Rand (IR) lock production facility in Duzce, 
confided to poloff that if IR had not purchased an existing 
plant (from ITO, Turkey\'s second-largest lock producer) the 
strict environmental standards would have prompted them to 
look elsewhere. 
 
 
9. (sbu) Finally, even Duzce\'s economic mainstay, hazelnut 
production, is now in danger.  Ozturk told poloff that this 
year\'s harvest will be 60 to 65 percent below previous years. 
 Although the decrease is part of a normal, albeit 
unpredictable, cycle in hazelnut production, hard-hit local 
farmers are desperate to diversify their products to protect 
themselves from future shocks.  Here too, though, farmers 
lament the fact that Duzce has very few food processing 
plants to soak up local production and seems unable to 
attract new investment. 
 
 
Pinning Hopes on AKP 
-------------------- 
10. (sbu) Despite the bleak situation, however, locals 
believe that the current AKP government is more understanding 
of their problems than previous governments.  Visiting Duzce 
the same day as poloff, the Agriculture Minister announced a 
new project to give 100 milk cows to 50 farmers in Duzce 
(Note: Ozturk criticized the implementation of the program 
but credited the government with \"good intentions\"). 
Medium-size business owners told poloff that despite the 
continuing need to apply for government \"incentives\" (i.e., 
tax exemptions), this government has taken a number of 
business-friendly measures.  Hikmet Keskin, President of the 
23,000-strong Esnaflar (small businessmen) Association (and a 
possible AKP local candidate himself), told poloff that his 
members have continuing concerns, but that this government 
has been responsive (e.g., on low-interest credit, 
restrictions on opening large supermarkets).  Finally, Duzce 
also hopes to benefit from proposed government incentives for 
provinces with an average annual income below USD 1500. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
11. (sbu) The message we heard from this Anatolian province 
echoes much of what we have heard in the teeming Istanbul 
suburbs: \"It\'s the economy, stupid.\"  Deliberations on Iraq, 
back-and-forth over education or public administration 
reform, Turkey\'s on-again off-again EU membership 
aspirations, even the occasional furor over headscarves are 
minor concerns for local residents who continue to struggle 
in the face of economic adversity.  AKP\'s success here in 
Duzce is more attributable to the party\'s ability to reach 
out to the people, listen to their concerns, and make 
good-faith efforts to address them, than to any ideological 
agenda.  Duzce residents may not be infinitely patient, but 
for now they have nowhere else to turn.

SUBJECT: NEW BOMBING WAVE TARGETS BRITISH INSTITUTIONS 
 
 
1.(U) At least two powerful explosions targeting British 
institutions rocked Istanbul shortly before 11 a.m. on 
Thursday, November 20.  The first exploded at 10:55 a.m. at 
the Istanbul headquarters of HSBC Bank in the Levent 
financial district.  Shortly thereafter a tremendously 
powerful explosion struck the British Consulate in the Taksim 
district, in the heart of Istanbul\'s shopping district (and 
near the former U.S. Consulate).  While Turkish press 
initially reported five explosions, the discrepency appears 
to have resulted from a number of secondary gas explosions. 
Initial reports indicate that 18 people were killed and 358 
wounded, but that total is likely to swiftly rise, given the 
magnitude of the blasts.  British Consul General Roger Short, 
who was seen entering the Consulate shortly before the 
explosion, is now listed as missing. 
 
 
2. (U) The first explosion struck in Levent, Istanbul\'s 
financial district, at 10:55 a.m., at the Istanbul 
headquarters of the London-based HSBC bank.  Conoffs and 
visiting Terrorist finance team felt the explosion from their 
meeting location with a Turkish bank over half a mile away. 
News photos show extensive damage to the fifteen story 
building, with windows blown in and the building\'s entrance 
area gutted.  Initial reports are that there were six 
fatalities at the site. 
 
 
3. (U) Moments later, a second even more powerful explosion 
occurred in front of the British Consulate in the Taksim 
district of Istanbul.  That explosion was audible all over 
the city, with a huge cloud of smoke billowing from the site. 
 Later photographs show that the bomb detonated directly in 
front of the Consulate\'s gate, levelling the entire gatehouse 
and causing major damage to the Consulate and surrounding 
streets, which constitute one of Istanbul\'s major shopping 
districts.  Ten people are reported dead at the site, but 
that total is also likely to rise. 
 
 
4. (U) Consulate will convene an EAC this afternoon to review 
our security profile in the wake of this ongoing terror 
campaign.  We will also hold a town hall meeting with the 
entire community.  At present, all Consulate employees and 
American dependents have been accounted for. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Consulate will also offer full assistance to our 
British colleagues, including possible office space for 
investigators at the old Consulate building in Beyoglu.

SUBJECT: BOMBING UPDATE 
 
 
REF: ISTANBUL 1744 
 
 
1.(SBU) Summary: The toll from yesterday\'s attacks in 
Istanbul now stands at 27 dead and 450 wounded.  Among the 
dead are British Consul General Roger Short and 12 other 
Consulate employees (two British, ten Turkish).  As in the 
November 15 blasts, most victims were Turks passing by the 
vicinity of the attacks.  They included noted actor Kerem 
Yilmazer.  To date, we have no reports of American 
casualties.  The official Turkish investigation is at an 
early stage, while a large Scotland Yard contingent arrived 
in the city late last night.  Consul General joined those 
meeting British Foreign Minister Jack Straw at Istanbul 
airport on the evening of November 20, and reiterated USG 
readiness to provide whatever assistance we can to our 
British colleagues.  UK officials have accepted the offer of 
the former U.S. Consulate in Beyoglu as a base of operations 
for the Scotland Yard investigation, and Turkish officials 
have moved to close the streets around the location.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Updated casualty figures indicate that 27 people 
died in the two November 20 bombings: 17 at the British 
Consulate and 10 at the headquarters of HSBC.  The vehicle 
targeting the Consulate succeeded in crashing through the 
compound\'s gates, and exploded inside the compound directly 
next to the buildings along the compound wall that housed 
temporary offices for the CG, Public Affairs, and Security 
officials.  The structures were obliterated in the blast; the 
bodies of Consul General Roger Short and his secretary, Lisa 
Hallworth, were recovered hours later after tons of debris 
were removed.  The fact that the vehicle penetrated the 
perimeter seems to account for the fact that while many 
injuries occurred among those passing by on the street and in 
the shops and offices surrounding the Consulate, there were 
relatively few fatalities. 
 
 
3. (U) In Levent, at the site of the first bombing, reports 
indicate that 10 people lost their lives.  Most were 
passers-by on the street, including noted actor Kerem 
Yilmazer, who was apparently driving by the building at the 
time of the explosion.  The front of the HSBC building was 
sheered off by the blast and lower floors were largely 
gutted, but to date only two fatalities have been reported 
among those inside the building. 
 
 
4. (SBU) We are working closely with our British colleagues 
to provide assistance, particularly on the security, 
administrative, and consular fronts.  The Consul General 
joined the group greeting Foreign Secretary Straw at Istanbul 
airport and reiterated Ambassador Edelman\'s earlier offer to 
help in whatever way we can.  GSO worked through the night of 
November 20-21 to ready the former American Consulate 
building for immediate occupancy, and British officials 
indicate that they will use it as their command post for the 
Scotland Yard team that will conduct its own investigation of 
the bombing.  Turkish officials have already taken steps to 
seal off the streets surrounding the property. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Meanwhile, life in Istanbul has resumed some of its 
normal rhythm, albeit with an underlying sense of shock and 
horror.  Even more than last weekend\'s attacks, yesterday\'s 
explosions, which occurred on a busy thoroughfare in the 
upscale Levent business district and on a crowded corner in 
the heart of the shopping and cultural hub of Beyoglu, 
brought home to the entire city its vulnerability.  Strangers 
and neighbors alike have taken the time to express their 
condolences not just to British expatriates, but others as 
well, expressing the wish \"Gecmis olsun\"-- may it pass. 
Prime Minister Erdogan encapsulated the feelings of most with 
his comment yesterday that \"those who bloodied this holy day 
and massacred innocent people will account for it in both 
worlds.  They will be damned until eternity.\"

Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
 
1. (U) After examining sites of the November 15 and 20 terrorist 
attacks, the Ambassador visited the Istanbul Mayor and Governor on 
November 24 to extend the condolences of the United States and to offer 
 
 
any further assistance that might be required during the investigations 
 
 
Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler, who supervises all of the Istanbul 
police and security services, offered the following comments on the 
terrorist attacks and the ongoing investigations. 
 
 
2. (SBU) \"We Must Remain Strong\": Guler noted that Istanbul had been 
both physically and psychologically unprepared for the attacks. 
Additionally, following the November 15 attacks on the synagogues, law 
enforcement authorities were more focused on the investigation than on 
preventing further attacks. Despite the shock, however, Guler echoed 
Prime Minister Erdogan\'s remarks by saying that as the investigation 
continues, Turkey must remain strong and continue to preserve its 
democracy, respect for human rights, and ongoing European Union reforms 
 
 
After all, Guler said, \"This is what the terrorists were targeting.\" 
 
 
3. (C) An International Struggle: Sharing views on Al-Qaeda and its 
methods, Guler stressed the importance of international cooperation in 
meeting this threat.  He thanked the Ambassador for U.S. assistance, 
noting that there has already been excellent cooperation and exchange o 
 
 
intelligence.  The Governor detailed some of the additional security 
measures that have been taken since the attacks, particularly to protec 
 
 
such public sites as airports, bridges, and shopping malls, in addition 
 
 
to sites that might be associated with those countries supporting the 
U.S. in its Coalition of the Willing (e.g., Italy, Bulgaria, Japan).  H 
 
 
admitted that closing off public streets is not always possible, but 
that the police are looking for the right balance between security and 
other concerns. 
 
 
4. (C) Investigations Continue: Guler told the Ambassador that the 
police have already gathered good evidence from the November 15 
bombings.  Echoing his Police Chief\'s public criticism of the local 
press, the Governor suggested that the failure to respect the 
sensitivity of the investigative process (i.e., the publication of the 
names of suspects and accomplices) may have hindered the ability of the 
 
 
police to prevent the second bombings.  Without providing specific 
details, Guler implied that there are \"signs\" that there may be further 
 
 
attacks. 
 
 
5. (SBU) The Ambassador noted that the defender\'s resources are finite 
and the terrorist\'s targets nearly endless, but he offered several 
suggestions that the Governor absorbed with keen interest.  The 
Ambassador pointed out that the color-coded threat alert system in the 
U.S. had drawn criticism but that it had also applied real pressure on 
terrorist planners.  Similarly, he said, although it may be impossible 
to close off more than a few streets in a metropolis like Istanbul, 
random vehicle checks along streets with potential target buildings 
would complicate and perhaps negate attack plans. 
 
 
6. (U)  The Ambassador also suggested that the Governor might meet with 
top security officials from New York City, including former Mayor 
Guiliani, in order to benefit from their experience in dealing with the 
 
 
aftermath of terrorist attacks and preventing future attacks.  [Note: 
NYC Mayor Bloomberg and Istanbul Mayor Gurtuna have already exchanged 
visits. Istanbul\'s U.S. Sister City is Houston, but the Department\'s 
Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs is looking into the 
possibility of formalizing another Sister City relationship 
between NYC and Istanbul.  Mission will pursue this proposal.

SUBJECT: TURKEY: A NEW FRONT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERROR 
 
REF: A) ISTANBUL 1703 & 1711 B) ISTANBUL 1744 & 1752 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Istanbul is slowly recovering from the shock 
of two separate sets of terrorist bombings that claimed over 
50 lives and wounded 750 in one week.  Although both the 
synagogue bombings (ref a) and the latest bombings of the 
British Consulate and HSBC Turkey headquarters (ref b) appear 
to have had specific targets, there is little doubt among 
public opinion that Turkey has become a new front for the war 
against international terror.  Even as investigators continue 
their search for the perpetrators and their accomplices, 
there is widespread speculation regarding the possible 
motives, targets, and messages of the attacks.  Despite some 
calls for disassociating Turkey from U.S. policies in Iraq 
and Israel, the attacks do not appear to have changed 
people\'s minds, but only to have reinforced what people 
already believed.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Who dunnit?: Public reaction to the attacks has moved 
from shock to anger.  The thrust of the anger appears to be 
directed at a faceless, nebulous terrorist threat.  Most 
accept official government statements that the attacks were 
carried out by Turkish citizens linked to extreme Islamic 
groups like IBDA-C (the Great Islamic Eastern Anatolian 
Raiders) and Hizbollah (an indigenous Turkish group, 
reportedly sponsored by Iran).  A majority also believe that 
these groups probably had some support from the Al-Qaeda 
international terrorist network.  On the other hand, there is 
a minority that questions whether Turks, or at least 
Islamists, were involved at all.  Some believe instead that 
the terrorists may have been secretly funded and supported by 
the U.S. or Israel in an effort to poison Turkey against 
radical Islamic groups (this viewpoint has also been 
articulated by several television commentators and printed in 
the local Islamic press).  Asked whether such a conspiracy 
theory seems a little far-fetched, a shopkeeper and barber 
separately told poloff cryptically that \"anything is possible 
in politics.\" 
 
 
3. (U) Why?: Among those who accept the apparent links with 
international terrorism, there is still widespread 
disagreement over what motivated the bombers.  Were the 
attacks designed to send a message to Israel, the U.K. and 
the U.S.?  Or, were they aimed at Turkey for supporting those 
governments and designed to destabilize Turkey\'s secular 
democracy?  This debate is likely to continue for some time. 
Protestors at a \"peace rally\" over the weekend reflected the 
diversity of opinions, with some calling for cutting ties 
with the U.S. and others calling for greater international 
cooperation against terrorism.  Our sense from our contacts 
here is that neither Turkey\'s democracy nor its relationship 
with the U.S. is directly threatened in the wake of these 
attacks. 
 
 
4. (U) What now?: Hotels and shopkeepers are already 
lamenting the negative impact that these attacks have had on 
one of the city\'s economic mainstays: tourism.  Shopkeepers 
in the Grand Bazaar remarked that the flow of visiting 
tourists had slowed to a trickle since the attacks.  The Four 
Seasons and other five-star hotels have already had numerous 
cancellations.  Most Turks here now anticipate, moreover, 
that with these attacks some sort of invisible line seems to 
have been crossed by international terrorists and that there 
will be more such attacks in the future.  Consequently, they 
are supportive of the government\'s intentions and efforts to 
investigate, apprehend, and prosecute the perpetrators as 
quickly and efficiently as possible.  Asked by poloff what 
Turkey should do now, a taxi driver shrugged and said that 
Turkey \"must continue to work with other countries in the 
struggle against international terrorism.\" 
 
 
5. (C) Comment: Reaction to the attacks is still settling in, 
but like Americans after September 11, many here see that 
their world has changed and wonder what will happen next. 
This reflectiveness does not characterize everyone, of 
course: those who were previously anti-American and did not 
believe that al-Queda carried out the September 11 attacks 
have not abandoned their views, but now want to see a U.S. 
hand either directly or indirectly causing the attack on 
Turkey.  But the mainstream of the population, including the 
Government and Security Services, seems to recognize the 
international cooperation is essential to fight this scourge 
and that Turkey\'s western democratic orientation must 
continue.

SUBJECT: BANKING SECTOR PREPARES FOR A \"BRAVE NEW WORLD\" 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: The strong profits reported by Turkish 
banks in 2003\'s third quarter show that the sector is 
gradually recovering from the effects of the 2001 crisis, 
according to industry analysts in Istanbul.  They note, 
however, that much of the recent good news is the result of 
the windfall profits that banks have enjoyed as a result of 
declining interest rates, which have raised the value of 
their Treasury securities.  Banks, they warn, have yet to 
show that they will be able to prosper in the new environment 
that will result if Turkey is able to stay the course and 
achieve its goal of sustainable low inflation and interest 
rates.  Analysts forsee a further wave of consolidation in 
the sector, arguing that banking restructuring is only \"half 
complete.\"  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) A positive quarter:  Most major Turkish banks easily 
beat analysts\' expectations in their recently announced 
third-quarter results.  Industry leader Akbank led the way 
with third quarter earnings of USD 376 million, bringing its 
nine month profit to USD 722 million, well above the market 
consensus of USD 572 million.  Two of Turkey\'s other big four 
banks, Garanti and Yapi Kredi, also exceeded expectations, 
though more modestly, while Isbank slightly undershot 
analysts\' expectations, largely due to higher loss provisions 
than analysts had expected. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Treasury windfall: Closer examination of bank 
balance sheets, however, shows that  the bulk of the profits 
stemmed from windfall profits on the banks\' holdings of 
Treasury bonds, which comprise from one-third to one-half of 
major banks\' assets.  Akbank, for example, holds nearly USD 
9.5 billion in government securities, composed of nearly 5.5 
billion in trading securities, 3.5 billion in securities 
available for sale, and only USD 450 million in securities 
held to maturity.  The latter figure is down significantly 
from its 2001 level of nearly USD 4.5 billion, reflecting the 
shift banks have made from holding securities to actively 
trading them in the secondary market.  The trend is evident 
at other banks as well, though less dramatically, given that 
Akbank leads the industry with 50 percent of its assets in 
government paper.  Garanti, for instance, has Treasury 
holdings of USD 5.8 billion (out of total assets of 14.2 
billion), but most of these are earmarked to be held to 
maturity, and a smaller percentage (28 percent) are 
denominated in Turkish lira.  The continuing bias of Turkish 
banks towards government paper was evident in recently 
published comments by the General Manager of Vakifbank. 
Asked to predict the bank\'s year-end profits, he said they 
would depend on future Central bank rate cuts, given that 
bank profitability stems from its government securities 
portfolio. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Loan expansion: Industry experts like Huseyin Imece 
at Yapi Kredi and Kubilay Cinemre at Garanti Bank stress that 
the banks\' strong performance in the first part of the year 
is deceiving, in that the industry as a whole is not yet at a 
point where it achieves a sustainable operation from its core 
operations.  Of Turkey\'s big four, only Yapi Kredi currently 
has a loan portfolio that eclipses its security portfolio. 
Other banks are seeking to expand market share, however. 
Akbank\'s market share in retail loans and SME\'s almost 
doubled in the first nine months of 2003, but the bank\'s 
total loan portfolio is still only half the size of its 
security portfolio, at USD 4.85 billion.  Garanti\'s market 
share in retail loans increased from 18 to 25 percent, while 
the bank\'s overall loan portfolio expanded by 6 percent to 
USD 4.4 billion, or 31 percent of assets.  Cinemre stressed, 
however, that banks cannot be profitable simply on the basis 
of these products alone: new instruments are needed, such as 
a long-term mortgage system. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Restructuring: Ercan Kumcu, who in addition to 
writing regularly on economic topics in \"Hurriyet\" newspaper, 
also heads Tekfenbank, one of the industry\'s smallest 
players, told us recently that while important progress has 
been registered in recent years in restructuring the sector, 
the process is still only half complete.  Beyond the issue of 
weak banks in the system that may have to be taken over, 
there are also structural problems, stemming both from high 
intermediation costs as a result of excessive government 
taxes, and banks\' own propensity to \"overbranch.\"  (Note: The 
IMF and World Bank are working with the GOT to find ways to 
bring down intermediation costs, and the GOT has agreed to a 
modest reduction in taxation on bank transactions beginning 
in 2004.  But the GOT is constrained by the need for revenue 
to meet its fiscal targets.  End Note.)  According to Kumcu, 
further consolidation in the sector is essential, as is 
additional foreign investment.  With foreign banks currently 
only holding a small fraction of the market, there is 
significant room for them to expand. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Other clouds: Kubilay warned of additional clouds on 
the horizon, however, as a result of the new draft banking 
law currently being debated in parliament.  As a reaction to 
the wave of bank failures in the 2001 crisis and the recent 
IMAR bank scandal (newspaper headlines recently trumpeted 
Justice Minister Celik\'s outrage at finding himself sharing a 
VIP waiting lounge with the former head of a failed Turkish 
bank, which had required the injection of hundreds of 
millions of dollars of government funds), the draft provides 
stiff penalties for bankers in the event of bankruptcy as a 
result of high losses.  The law, Kubilay noted, would permit 
seizure of the personal assets of bankers and their families 
in such instances.  Inevitably, he argued, such regulations 
would have a chilling effect on the sector and dissuade 
bankers from assuming any risk.  The Banker\'s Association has 
reportedly been urging the GOT not to make this feature of 
the law quite so draconian.  IMF staff reportedly agree that 
it is too draconian, but attach greater priority to the 
portions of the draft legislation relating to the bank 
regulatory and deposit insurance agencies.

1. (C) Summary: U/S Grossman met with the Governor of 
Istanbul to express U.S. solidarity with the people of 
Istanbul and Turkey, and our ongoing cooperation in the war 
on terror.  Guler outlined a series of \"lessons learned\" from 
the attacks, and expressed optimism that Turkey would be 
better prepared in the future to interdict larger-scale 
attacks.  Guler expressed thanks for USG support against 
terrorism in the past, and some frustration at European 
attitudes regarding threats to Turkey.  U/S Grossman thanked 
Guler for excellent cooperation in the war on terror, 
including assistance in safeguarding USG personnel here in 
Istanbul.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) U/S Grossman met December 9 with Istanbul Governor 
Muamer Guler.  Guler, a career civil servant in the Ministry 
of the Interior, oversees the security apparatus for the 
Istanbul province, and directly oversees GoT measures in 
response to the four bombings which took place in Istanbul in 
November. 
 
 
\"Not quite ready\" for attacks 
----------------------------- 
 
 
3. (C) Guler was candid in his observation that Istanbul was 
not fully prepared for coordinated attacks like those which 
took place in November.  Guler said that, in the past, 
Istanbul had seen its share of smaller-scale terrorist 
attacks, such as those carried out by PKK/KADEK, DHKP-C, and 
others.  He said that Turkey has now realized the need to 
prepare for larger, coordinated attacks. 
 
 
4. (C) Guler thanked the U.S. for its consistent support of 
Turkey in the context of the war on terror.  Guler said 
Turkey looks for such support from our European allies as 
well, and hopes that all governments see such attacks as 
attacks against civilization and humanity, not just Istanbul 
and Turkey.  U/S Grossman said that the USG, from President 
Bush and Secretary Powell to Amb. Edelman and CG Arnett, have 
conveyed our sense of solidarity with the people of Turkey. 
U/S Grossman said he went to the sites of the attacks, Neve 
Shalom Synagogue and the British Consulate General, to 
personally express his solidarity, and was impressed by the 
spirit of the people of Istanbul, who are already rebuilding. 
 
 
EU surprisingly alarmist 
------------------------ 
 
 
5. (C) Guler noted that, while U.S. support for Turkey has 
been strong in the wake of the attacks, \"our European friends 
have been unexpectedly worried.\"  He said that 25 percent of 
tourists coming to Turkey visit Istanbul, and recent EU 
statements saying that Turkey and Istanbul are not safe hurt 
Turkey, which is what the terrorists want.  U/S Grossman 
noted that in the past the USG has tried to focus the 
attention of our European allies on terrorist groups which 
attack Turkey.  He said it is unfortunate that the EU often 
takes too long to see these groups as terrorists.  U/S 
Grossman noted, however, that we will continue to work with 
the EU and others to keep them focused on these groups, 
closing their offices and cutting off their finances.  U/S 
Grossman highlighted the upcoming NATO Summit in Istanbul as 
a major opportunity for Turkey to show the EU and others its 
progress in democracy, economic, and social development over 
the last 20-25 years. 
 
 
Attackers\' Profile and Whereabouts 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
6. (C) Guler addressed the issue of cooperation with Syria in 
pursuing suspected bombers.  He said that it now appears that 
Azad Ekinci planned the attacks, and that he had escaped to 
Syria.  Syria quickly responded to the attacks by arresting 
20 people and immediately turning them over to Turkey.  After 
interrogation by GoT officials, it became clear than most of 
these people had little to nothing to do with the attacks 
(most of whom were school children), and only one was finally 
arrested.  Guler said Turkey knows for the most part who the 
assailants are, and believes 4-5 people are still at large, 
and probably entered Syria at the time of or soon after the 
attacks.  Guler added that he believes Syria is \"trying to be 
as helpful as possible within the framework of the Adana 
Agreement between Turkey and Syria.\" 
 
 
7. (C) When asked about the possibility of any links that 
these terrorists may have with Iran, Guler replied that 
\"Turkey has no problems with Iran.  One key figure, Yusuf 
Polat, was caught by Iranians at the border.\"  Guler said 
that \"it is quite clear that a group of friends came together 
in Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Syria.  But, the button for 
this attack was pushed by al-Qaida.\"  Guler described the 
group as a \"platform,\" which was organized and trained 
abroad, but which hosted others who came from outside and 
carried out the attacks.  He noted that this \"platform\" type 
of organization made detection difficult. 
 
 
Cooperation in war on terror 
---------------------------- 
 
 
8. (C) U/S Grossman also expressed thanks on behalf of the 
USG for the assistance and protection that U.S. military and 
diplomatic personnel have received in Istanbul.  \"We 
appreciate your efforts to keep us safe,\" he said.  \"We 
remain ready to cooperate with you in an effort to stop these 
terrorists.\"

FRAY 
 
 
Classified By: Consul-General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Absent an open border between Turkey and 
Armenia, twice-weekly flights between Istanbul and Yerevan 
since 1995 have provided some of the only direct contact 
between Turks and Armenians.  Initially operated by the 
state-owned (and now bankrupt) Armenian Airlines, the rights 
were taken over last year by a private Russian company, 
Armavia.  Following an agreement between the Turkish and 
Armenian Foreign Ministers, however, on October 16, a Turkish 
firm, Tower Aviation, initiated twice-weekly flights of its 
own.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Twice-weekly flights between Istanbul and Yerevan 
since 1995 represent the only direct links between Turkey and 
Armenia.  According to Dikran Altun, a Turkish-Armenian who 
acted as Armenian Airlines\' Istanbul representative for 
several years, 90 percent of the passengers are Armenian 
\"suitcase traders\" traveling to Istanbul to purchase goods 
for resale in Armenia.  Only 10 to 15 tickets are sold on 
each flight to Turks (generally Turkish-Armenians, but 
occasionally Turkish businessmen).  Although the Turkish 
government requires the airline to submit seasonal and 
monthly applications for the charter flights, Altun claims 
that there were never any real problems with securing the 
necessary approvals.  It was always clear, however, that 
Turkish Civil Aviation authorities passed along applications 
to the Turkish Foreign Ministry for \"political\" approval. 
(Note: Altun neglected to mention the brief period when the 
flights were disrupted by the Turkish government\'s decision 
to stop issuing visas for Armenians at the Istanbul airport 
following the passage of an Armenian \"genocide law\" by the 
French parliament.  End Note.) 
 
 
3. (C) After two years of trying, Altun himself recently 
secured permission and initiated additional flights on 
October 16 along the same route under the auspices of his own 
firm, Tower Aviation.  Altun told poloff that while a 
personal appeal to then-Foreign Minister Ismail Cem failed to 
secure the necessary political approval, an agreement reached 
between FMs Abdullah Gul and Vartan Oskanian earlier this 
year did the trick.  Arsen Avegyan, the Armenian 
representative to the Black Sea Economic Cooperation forum, 
confirmed to poloff that the Foreign Ministers had 
specifically discussed this issue.  Avegyan added that in the 
framework of seeking a gradual improvement in bilateral ties, 
the Armenian side is now interested in exploring the idea of 
allowing cargo flights between the two countries. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Tower Aviation rents both its equipment and crews 
from another private Turkish firm, Fly Air (which also 
recently initiated the first domestic Turkish flights to 
compete with state-owned Turkish Airlines).  Altun told 
poloff that he has minimal expectations regarding potential 
profits from this venture.  His costs are about USD 19,000 
per round-trip flight (USD 18,000 for the equipment and crew 
and approximately USD 1,000 for ticketing, sales, and 
marketing expenses).  The capacity for each flight is 148 
passengers and tickets are currently available for TL 270 
million (USD 190).  According to his calculations, Altun said 
that he needs to sell about 100 seats on each flight to break 
even.  Since October (admittedly not the high season), Altun 
said that he has had only 60-70 passengers on each flight. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Altun\'s biggest concern, however, stems from what he 
labeled \"unfair competition\" from Armavia.  Altun claimed 
that Armavia is \"trying to crowd him out\" by pressuring 
travel agencies in Armenia not to sell his tickets.  Because 
Armavia now controls most of the flights in and out of 
Armenia, Altun claims that travel agents are susceptible to 
such pressure.  Armavia has also threatened to add a third 
weekly flight in order to undercut demand for Tower/Fly Air. 
If he continues to have problems, Altun said that he plans to 
petition the Turkish Civil Aviation authorities to cancel one 
of Armavia\'s twice-weekly flights.  This would force Armenian 
passengers who do not want to spend a full week in Istanbul 
to use Altun\'s airline.  Altun was confident that such 
pressure would immediately resolve his problems with Armavia. 
 
 
6. (C) Embassy Comment: The Turkish MFA views the approval of 
these flights, NGO exchanges, and the proposed joint 
restoration of historic monuments as modest examples of 
improved Turkish-Armenian relations.  They continue, however, 
to link the opening of the border and the restoration of full 
diplomatic relations to a Nagorno-Karabakh settlement (or at 
least to Armenian concessions towards such a settlement).

2. (SBU) Summary: Recent soundings among leading Istanbul 
market analysts and participants highlight the extent to 
which Turkey\'s continued strong macroeconomic performance has 
left them more optimistic about the future.  With strong 
disinflation and export performance, acceptable growth 
results, and continued progress on IMF implementation, our 
contacts give some credit to the AK government for keeping 
the economy on the right track.  Their optimism is tempered, 
however, by recognition that Turkey\'s recovery is fragile and 
could easily reverse if the government missteps and returns 
to populist policies that shake market confidence, fails to 
implement structural reforms, or slips on its EU accession 
track.  Looming too is the challenge Turkish business will 
face in the new world that will result if the GOT is 
successful in sustaining low inflation and low interest rates 
over the long term.  Mehmet Kutman, head of Turkey\'s largest 
securities firm, noted that his key worries center on the 
private sector, which has grown comfortable and complacent 
from the existing order, and will face difficulties in a new 
world where the benefits it has grown accustomed to receiving 
from the government are absent.  End Summary. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Visiting Ankara Economic Counselor and P/E Chief 
canvassed a number of leading market analysts and 
participants during a series of meetings on December 11, 
including Mehmet Kutman, Chairman of Global Securities (and a 
nephew of former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz), Demir Sabanci, 
head of the Sabanci Group\'s retail division, Ayse Berker, 
head of Fitch Rating\'s Istanbul office, and Bender analysts 
Emin Ozturk and Murat Gulkan.  All saw significant 
improvement in the economy over the last year, with Kutman 
and his chief strategist, Tevfik Aksoy, highlighting renewed 
interest by foreign investors in Turkey and Sabanci noting a 
pickup in retail demand.  However, our conversations also 
revealed that business investment remains low and that the 
recovery has not yet produced much job creation or boosted 
consumer spending significantly. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Pluses and Minuses: Kutman and Aksoy were optimistic 
overall, noting good results on the macro side and the 
\"feel-good\" effect of a strong single-party government. 
Kutman (who has sought to build good relations with the AK 
government) noted that he believes in Prime Minister Erdogan 
and especially Finance Minister Unakitan, though the rest of 
the team is less strong.  He opined that they don\'t yet have 
full cognizance of their strength and what they can 
accomplish, but that they \"listen to feedback,\" are likely to 
steer clear of corruption (given their lack of ties to 
established major business groups), and are open to foreign 
direct investment.  He noted that he has never seen more 
interest in Turkey than he sees now, especially from 
Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Far Eastern groups.  With 
the current positive momentum from good macroeconomic 
results, he believes that the market is better positioned to 
absorb occasional mistakes by the government, such as the 
inexperience the government showed in allowing groups that 
opposed the privatization of TEKEL to raise unrealistic 
expectations about the company\'s value, thereby leading 
Unakitan to void the tender when bids came in at a lower 
level.  Kutman challenged the idea that all government 
attempts to weaken independent regulatory boards are a bad 
idea, strongly criticizing the performance of the Banking 
board under former chairman Engin Akcakoca (Ankara septel 
reports on our Istanbul meeting with Akcakoca) for having 
pursued policies that raised the cost of the reorganization 
of the sector. 
 
 
5. (SBU) A Vulnerable Private Sector: In Kutman\'s view, 
today\'s crucial need is for the optimism that has flowed from 
good macroeconomic results and other positive developments 
over the past year to move to the real economy.  Otherwise, 
he argued, it may prove ephemeral.  He noted that real wages 
have yet to recover from the crisis (and parenthetically that 
he has not raised wages at Global for two years), so that 
demand is top down rather than bottom up.  (Sabanci confirmed 
this point, noting that while sales are recovering at Sabanci 
retail chains, the average consumer is still spending, per 
visit to his stores, less than half what he or she spent 
before the crisis.)  Kutman\'s key worries center on the 
private sector, which has grown too accustomed to growing 
through government handouts, whether from discounts from 
state enterprises (Tupras\' privatizion will squeeze the 
private sector, he suggested), government contracts, or 
government sanctioned monopoly power.  Turkish businesses, he 
said, are still \"not comfortable,\" and so only bring money 
back to Turkey to play the securities market, rather than 
make real investments.  The new environment, and the added 
challenge of foreign competition, he suggested, will force a 
change in the way Turkish business operates.  Beyond this, 
his concerns focus on the bureaucracy and judiciary, which 
often seek to block the government, as they have recently on 
privatization and banking reform.  The legal system, he 
argued, is the key problem in Turkey: one that cannot be 
fixed in one or even five years. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Nuances: Analysts at Fitch Ratings and Bender 
Securities were more cautious.  Fitch\'s Ayse Berker, for 
instance, told us that she continues to believe that promised 
U.S. assistance is critical to maintaining stability in 
Turkish markets.  Without that money or potential World Bank 
assistance, she forsees real debt repayment problems in 2005. 
 She noted that she remains concerned about the government\'s 
reform commitment, given delays in passing key measures for 
the sixth review (key banking and public administration 
measures did finally clear parliament after our discussion), 
and that ironically on some issues the earlier coalition had 
taken more decisive action than AK, which she characterized 
as a \"coalition in a party.\"  She questioned where growth 
would originate in 2004, given the government\'s need to 
maintain a large primary surplus, and worried about the 
banking sector\'s ability to make money in a low-interest-rate 
environment.  Bender analysts Emin Ozturk and Murat Gulkan 
echoed these concerns, adding that with the IMF\'s new softer 
tone and the market\'s sunny optimism, it isn\'t clear \"who 
will push the government\" to continue to take the necessary 
tough decisions.  They, along with Berker, noted that 
Turkey\'s economic outlook for 2004 would also depend on 
global economic trends (low global rates have pushed money to 
Turkey in 2003), as well as progress toward EU accession, 
including a Cyprus solution. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Populism Redux: Ozturk and Gulkan pointed to rumors 
of new populist measures that the government is considering, 
including an amnesty for debtors to state banks, an increase 
in the minimum wage and in pensions.  They (like former BDDK 
head Akcakoca at lunch) also challenged Kutman\'s suggestion 
that AK is distant from all major holdings, noting progress 
on a plan to allow Mehmet Kahramehmet to negotiate down his 
three billion debt to the government for Pamukbank by nearly 
forty percent in exchange for early repayment.  (The deal has 
not yet been finalized, but all are intrigued too by the fact 
that Kahramehmet\'s Cukorova Group has emerged as a bidder for 
Tupras at a time when its debts to the government exceed 4.5 
billion dollars.)  Sabanci noted that the AK party\'s populist 
activism has extended to \"Wal-mart\" type restrictions to keep 
major retailers from moving into areas where they would 
disrupt small and medium-sized enterprises.  At the same 
time, however, AK is moving to protect food manufacturers 
from competition from \"store-brands.\"  Currently, he opined, 
\"competitiveness and productivity\" are not the watchwords in 
Ankara. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment:  Though some credit Turkey\'s AK government 
with having moved partway up a learning curve as a result of 
market signals over the last year, all of our interlocutors, 
even the relatively optimistic Kutman, agreed that this has 
not changed the fundamental fact that the current government 
suffers from a lack of understanding of economics.  As a 
result, there is no strategic economic vision within the 
government, and the senior leadership is often sympathetic to 
populist proposals that are economically damaging.  End 
Comment.

REF: ISTANBUL 294 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: Tourism industry executives are again 
wondering what the future holds for their sector following 
November\'s suicide bombings in Istanbul.  The attacks 
interrupted a strong sectoral recovery that saw visitor 
figures surpass last year\'s level by the end of November, and 
tourism revenues exceed the government\'s postwar estimates by 
over a billion dollars.  Though cancellations are estimated 
to have hit 40-50 percent of late-November and December 
bookings, their impact has been cushioned by the fact that 
this is Turkey\'s low season for tourism.  But a wave of 
cancellations of conferences and congresses threatens to 
deprive the oft-beleagured sector of an important source of 
income, and worries persist that the new security environment 
will lead major cruise lines to drop Turkey from their 
itineraries next year.  Many industry executives note their 
sense of \"betrayal\" at the decision of many of Turkey\'s 
allies to warn their nationals against travel to Turkey, and 
express hope that the warnings will be speedily lifted.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Rebound: After the quick end to combat operations in 
Iraq in early April, tourism in Turkey posted a surprisingly 
strong and healthy recovery.  Visitor numbers passed last 
year\'s total at the end of November, and industry leaders 
expect the year\'s total to be somewhere between 13.5 million 
(according to the Tourism Investors\' Association) and 14 
million (per the Hotel Operators Association).  While overall 
revenue will not approach last year\'s, as a result of the 
discounts that operators offered to entice visitors back to 
Turkey, initial rough estimates are that the sector will earn 
9.8 billion USD in 2003, well above the Turkish government\'s 
postwar forecast of 8.7 billion USD, and nearly equal to 
2002\'s 10 billion USD level.  The season was particularly 
strong in Antalya, a favorite beach destination of European 
travelers, which accounts for up to 45 percent of the 
national industry.  (Istanbul-based tourism represents 20 
percent, Aegean tourism 25 percent, with the remainder 
divided among specialty \"cultural\" destinations such as 
Cappadoccea.) 
 
 
3. (SBU) Another blow: Coming at a time when Turkey had had 
some success in differentiating itself from its dangerous 
neighborhood and luring visitors back to the country, the 
November blasts in Istanbul had an immediate chilling effect. 
 Hotel operators in Istanbul ranging from small boutique 
hotels to large five-star luxury properties report 
cancellations of 40-50 percent of their late-November and 
December reservations.  The impact swiftly trickled down to 
other businesses that depend on the tourist trade: Istanbul\'s 
famed Grand Bazaar has been unusually quiet for the holiday 
season, with many merchants reporting little to no business. 
Of even more concern to the industry is the decision of many 
organizations to defer or cancel planned conferences and 
programs in Istanbul.  Ustun Ozbey, a senior executive at the 
Koc Group\'s SETUR travel agency, pointed to the decision of a 
major medical group to cancel its planned May congress in the 
city and move it to Western Europe.  The congress had 
represented years of work, he noted, and would have brought 
thousands of high-income tourists to the city with 
expenditures well above those of an average visitor.  It will 
take years, he suggested, for Istanbul to recoup such losses. 
 Nedret Koruyan, Secretary General of the Tourist Investors\' 
Association, noted that private sector and government 
officials plan to meet to discuss the crisis in the industry 
resulting from the bombings.  She held out little hope that 
there is a magic solution, however. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Betrayal: Ozbey expressed particular concern with 
the decision of major Western nations to warn their citizens 
against travel to Turkey.  While conceding the need for 
countries to ensure their citizens\' safety, he argued that 
countries should have stood by Turkey rather than handing a 
\"victory to the terrorists.\"  Mehmet Kutman, head of Turkey\'s 
largest securities firm, told us on December 11 that the 
Turkish government is also very preoccupied with the travel 
warning issue, especially because of its potential impact on 
cruise ship visits.  He noted that cruise lines are now 
making out their 2004 schedules, and many are cancelling 
planned port calls in Turkey.  With each ship disgorging 
thousands of passengers, such cancellations threaten that the 
industry\'s difficulties may persist into next year.  (Note: 
Princess Cruise lines went forward with one port call in 
Kusadasi after the November 17 bombings; no Istanbul port 
calls are planned during the winter.) 
 
 
5. (SBU) Low season: For now, most industry executives are 
putting a brave face on the situation.  And some are 
genuinely sanguine about the industry\'s ability to recover. 
Koruyan noted that with the attacks occurring in Turkey\'s low 
season, there are grounds for hope that the sector can 
recover in time for next year.  Key tests will come at winter 
fairs in Turkey\'s major markets, including Germany and 
Russia.  (Though as last year\'s experience shows, the sector 
can pick up again even when advance reservations are 
limited.)  In addition, resort destinations such as the 
Turkish Aegean and Mediterranean coasts are likely to bounce 
back more easily given their appeal to niche \"beach-going\" 
markets.  Ozbey noted that Turkey retains its price advantage 
relative to other Mediterranean and Aegean destinations in 
Europe, and should benefit from that fact. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: More challenging will be the task of luring 
visitors back to Istanbul.  The fabled city on the Bosphorus 
has always represented a bridge between diverse cultures, 
mixing a European sophistication with the mystery and 
\"otherness\" of the Middle East.  With terrorism rearing its 
head in Istanbul, that latter element has undoubtedly assumed 
heightened and less favorable prominence in the eyes of many 
potential visitors.  End Comment.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I plans to 
travel to Cuba to accept title to a rebuilt Greek Orthodox 
Church in Havana.  He has undertaken to raise human rights 
concerns both publicly and privately while in Cuba, and has 
agreed to a reception hosted by U.S., Greek, and Turkish 
diplomats.  Bartholomew has declined Castro\'s offer of a 
state guest house during his visit to Cuba.  Competition for 
primacy in the Orthodox world with Russia remains a key 
factor influencing his travel to Cuba.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
Deciding to go to Cuba 
---------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) Bartholomew began by thanking the Consul General and 
USG for their support for him over the years.  He said that 
he understood USG misgivings, and respected the USG 
perspective, but felt that he had to go.  He said, \"I am 
frequently criticized by Greek nationalists for being an 
instrument of Turkey.  Not going would subject me to further 
criticism of bowing to American influence, and would open the 
USG to criticism of pressuring me against performing a 
pastoral duty.  As a religious man I must find balance 
between these concerns and the misgivings we have about the 
Cuban government.\" 
 
 
3. (C) Bartholomew said that he was obliged to travel to 
Havana to receive the deed to the church from the Cuban 
government, but has taken USG concerns into account while 
planning the trip.  Bartholomew said he had declined an offer 
of staying in an official guest house, but would instead stay 
in a hotel with 1000 supporters who would also be traveling 
to Cuba, most of whom, according to him, are U.S. citizens 
(including Metropolitan Demetrios of the United States). 
Bartholomew plans to attend a reception/luncheon for him 
hosted by Greek and Turkish Ambassadors and the head of USINT 
Havana.  Per his usual practice, Bartholomew plans to make an 
initial courtesy call on the Turkish Ambassador in his 
capacity as a Turkish citizen.  He said he is willing to 
attend a dinner, currently in the planning stage, to be 
hosted by the Turkish Ambassador. 
 
 
A Human Rights Agenda 
--------------------- 
 
 
4. (C)  Making reference to the prior meeting with CG 
regarding planned travel to Cuba, Bartholomew said he is 
planning to mention human rights concerns in his upcoming 
travel to Cuba.  He said that he plans to raise these 
concerns both in public statements and in private meetings 
with Cuban leadership, noting \"I have a feeling that the USG 
will be pleased.\"  Bartholomew said, however, that he feels 
he must also express gratitude to the Cuban government for 
its assistance in rebuilding the church in Havana, and for 
its support for Orthodoxy.  He said that Cuban officials have 
assured him that his church will have \"complete religious 
freedom\" in Cuba. 
 
 
5. (C) Bartholomew said he understands the concerns of other 
churches in Cuba, however.  He said that he had sent a note 
to the Pope offering his assistance and had \"just spoken with 
Monsignor Georges Marovitch of the Papal Nuncio in Istanbul, 
and asked if, during my visit to Cuba, I could be of help to 
the Roman Catholic Church.  I will attempt to use the visit 
to coordinate religious work in solving some of the problems 
faced by the people of Cuba.\" 
 
 
The Russian Angle 
----------------- 
 
 
6. (C) CG asked whether the Ecumenical Patriarch would 
publicly urge the Cuban government to give permission for 
building and renovation to other churches that, to date, have 
been denied it.  Bartholomew said that the issue of church 
construction was complicated by the actions of the Russian 
Orthodox Church, especially the political machinations of 
President Putin and Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk. 
Essentially, if Bartholomew does not go to Cuba, Castro will 
give the church to the Russians, who \"always build a church 
wherever there is a Russian Embassy, regardless of the number 
of Russian Orthodox in the area.  The Russians constantly 
pursue political ends through religion.\" 
7. (C) Bartholomew continued, saying that the Russians have 
tried to pressure Castro not to assist the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate in Cuba, and have alleged to Castro and others 
that Bartholomew is working with the CIA in Estonia to thwart 
Russian aspirations there. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
8. (C) The key motivating factor for Bartholomew\'s planned 
travel to Cuba is beating the Russian Orthodox Church to the 
punch.  He believes that the measures he has taken (staying 
in a hotel, raising human rights issues publicly and 
privately, providing time to meet with diplomats separate 
from Cuban government-arranged meetings) will prevent the 
visit from being used as propaganda by Castro.  It seems from 
his tone, however, that any direct criticism of the Castro 
regime will be moderate, as Bartholomew seeks to consolidate 
his victory over the Russians.

SUBJECT: LATE OFFER MUDDIES TUPRAS PRIVATIZATION 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: Turkish analysts are reacting positively 
today to yesterday\'s announcement that the highest bid for 
privatization of two-thirds of the state refinery Tupras came 
in at 1.3 billion USD.  While the press has been critical of 
the offer, the bid values the overall company at 2 billion 
USD, which market analysts term a \"reasonable\" discount from 
its current market capitalization of 2.4 billion USD.  The 
losing bidder, Anadolu Consortium, which includes Cukurova 
Holding and a Kazakh partner, briefly muddied the waters on 
January 14 by announcing it would raise its bid above 1.3 
billion USD, but privatization officials swiftly termed this 
impossible, noting that it would require cancellation of the 
tender and recommencement of the process.  Most analysts we 
have consulted view the winning bid as a reasonable 
valuation, and while reluctant to predict its ultimate 
disposition, note that the Privatization Administration\'s 
decision to submit it to the High Privatization Council for 
approval is a positive indication.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) The winning bid of 1.3 billion for TUPRAS from 
Efremov Kautschuk GmbH (a little known Russian company that 
is widely believed to represent the interests of Tatneft, 
Russia\'s sixth-largest oil company) and Zorlu Holding (which 
only announced its intention to join in the Efremov bid on 
January 12) values the overall company at 2 billion USD. 
While the valuation represents a discount from the company\'s 
market capitalization of 2.4 billion USD, leading analysts 
such as Bender Securities term it a \"reasonable\" one.  (Zorlu 
and Efremov would pay 50 percent in cash and the remainder in 
two equal yearly installments.)  After the embarrassments 
that surrounded the attempted privatization of Petkim (won by 
the infamous Uzan clan but ultimately voided) and Tekel\'s 
tobacco operations (where the highest bid was less than half 
government expections), observers view the result as a 
success, in that it exceeded market expectations.  Indeed, 
prior to the announcement, Turkish stocks had trended down on 
fears that the PA would either cancel the tender or ask 
bidders to raise their offer.  The PA\'s decision to instead 
submit the offer to the High Privatization Council is thus 
viewed as a sign that the government may let the sale go 
through. 
 
 
3. (SBU) The issue was muddied, however, on January 14, by 
the announcement by the losing bidder, the Anadolu 
Consortium, that it would raise its offer above 1.3 billion 
USD.  PA officials swiftly rejected the overture, noting that 
such an action is legally impossible, and would require 
cancellation of the tender and reopening of the process, 
something it is loath to do after the highly publicized 
failures of the Tekel and Petkim privatizations.  There may 
be other challenges as well, however, including legal ones. 
Though Ahmet Zorlu indicated there were no plans for 
redundancies at Tupras, the union representing many of the 
company\'s employees indicated that it would go to court to 
void the sale. 
 
 
4. (SBU) If analysts view the bid amount for Tupras as 
reasonable, there is wide speculation about the sudden 
decision of Zorlu, whose holding is only peripherally 
involved in the energy sector, to join forces with Tatneft at 
the last minute.  Bender Securities Research Director Murat 
Gulkan, without naming names, speculated that Zorlu may be 
operating as a front for the \"largest downstream distributor\" 
in Turkey-- i.e. the Dogan Group.  He further conjectured 
that down the road there may be a share exchange that would 
permit Dogan to create a vertically integrated empire with 
his Petrol Ofisi gas distribution chain.  If true, this might 
also explain the persistent interest of Karamehmet\'s Cukurova 
group, given his longstanding differences with Dogan. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: Though the tender was arguably successful 
in attracting bids that represent a reasonable valuation of 
the company, other elements of the tender process raise 
questions.  The Zorlu Group\'s ability to join the bidding on 
the eve of the tender\'s announcement raises questions about 
the entire process, as does the ability of a holding group 
(Cukurova) that bankrupted two banks and still owes the 
government billions of dollars to qualify as one of the final 
two bidders.  Finally, some may be concerned about the 
prospect of a Russian company entering the Turkish energy 
market in a big way.   Despite these caveats, most analysts 
believe that approval of the sale is critical to the 
credibility of the government\'s privatization program, and 
are thus looking for its ultimate approval.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL ANTI-TRAFFICKING EFFORT UPDATE 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Poloff met January 14 with Human Resource 
Development Foundation (HRDF) Executive Director Demet Gural 
in Istanbul  to get an update on TIP programs and efforts to 
put together a shelter for trafficked women.  To date, the 
GoT has offered no funding for a separate shelter for 
trafficked women or for training programs.  HRDF does 
organize training in conjunction with GoT agencies, though, 
and has gotten significant moral support.  In the absence of 
monetary assistance, however, GoT efforts to combat 
trafficking in Istanbul remain incomplete.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Training Programs 
----------------- 
 
 
2. (SBU) Gural reports that HRDF is having success with two 
upcoming training programs.  One, for prosecutors and judges, 
is GoT approved and scheduled for January 26.  Funding comes 
from the British Council, Chamber of Commerce, and TURSAB. 
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is 
providing an expert to lecture.  A second program, aimed at 
police officers, has also gotten the go-ahead and is 
scheduled for February or March.  Chamber of Commerce and 
TURSAB will provide support for this program as well. 
 
 
3. (SBU) HRDF is also working with the Kadikoy Mayor on a 
project involving illegal migrants, one component of which 
includes sex workers.  The program has EU funding.  The 
Kadikoy Mayor\'s office is also considering collaboration with 
HRDA on a possible shelter project.  Kadikoy currently has a 
women\'s shelter (for general purposes, not TIP-specific) with 
10-15 beds, according to Gural. 
 
 
GoT Support and Funding 
----------------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) According to Gural, GoT support and funding has been 
a mixed bag.  GoT has not given any material support of any 
type, or committed to any future support for programs or 
shelters.  GoT contacts have told Gural that, due to budget 
constraints, funding a shelter is not currently feasible. 
 
 
5. (SBU) However, working relations have gotten much better, 
according to Gural.  She says officials with whom she 
regularly has contact on migrant and sex worker issues have 
become substantially better-informed and more cooperative. 
She reports 2 cases of trafficked women that were reported to 
HRDA (one in Antalya, one in Kusadasi) since Summer of 2003. 
She says all proper procedures were carried out in handling 
both cases.  In one of the two cases, however, she contacted 
the women\'s shelter in Buyukcekmece (outlying European 
Istanbul) to inquire about possible shelter for the woman, 
and, when they found out she was a foreigner, they became 
unwilling to further assist without a letter from the 
Governor\'s office or a ministry in Ankara requesting 
admission of the woman.  Fortunately, other shelter options 
were found.  An attitude of hesitation regarding foreign 
women seems to continue, according to Gural. 
 
 
USG Funding question 
-------------------- 
 
 
6. (SBU) The possibility of funding from USG sources was 
previously discussed with TDY Embassy Poloff.  Gural inquired 
about any progress on USG funding for a shelter or other TIP 
programs.  Poloff committed to inquiring with the Embassy and 
Washington about any possibilities that exist for funding, 
but cautioned that any potential sources would certainly not 
be found until after the DOS budget is passed.  She 
understood.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL EMPLOYERS\' MUTED REACTION TO TURKEY\'S 
MINIMUM WAGE JUMP 
 
 1.  Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet 
distribution. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Summary: The recent decision of the Turkish 
government to increase Turkey\'s minimum wage by 38 percent, 
while also raising pensions by 21 percent, has sparked strong 
criticism in financial circles, but only a muted reaction 
from organizations representing the \"real\" economy. 
Istanbul-based employers\' associations note that the raise 
was imposed over their objections by government and labor 
representatives in the tripartite commission that is 
responsible for addressing the issue.  They stress, however, 
that the primary impact will be felt in the Anatolian 
heartland, rather than Istanbul, given that most workers here 
already earn far above the minimum wage.  Leading brokerages 
are less sanguine, worrying about the potential impact on 
Turkey\'s budget and about the potential for more \"populist\" 
measures in the run-up to March\'s local elections.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
3. (SBU) The decision by the Turkish government to raise the 
country\'s minimum wage by 38 percent at the beginning of the 
year (representing a net 34 percent increase to recipients), 
together with its subsequent decision to raise pensions by 21 
percent, has brought only a muted reaction from Istanbul 
business circles.  Meetings with a range of employers\' 
associations, including those in the glass and food 
industries, showed little concern about the issue.  Food 
Employers\' association head Nazim Duzenli noted that 
employers had refused to sign on to the increase in the 
tripartite commission that addresses the issue, leaving it to 
be adopted over their objections by labor and government 
officials.  He predicted little immediate impact on his 
members, however, given that his association has no employers 
with workers who earn the minimum wage.  That is true, he 
suggested, of most businesses in Istanbul and the Marmara 
region.  The measure\'s impact, he predicted, would be greater 
in Turkey\'s Anatolian heartland, among small to medium-sized 
employers (KOBIs) who do tend to have workers at minimum-wage 
levels.  Teoman Yenigun, head of the glass employers\' 
association, concurred with this argument, adding, however, 
that over time there would be a trickle-down effect on larger 
Istanbul-based businesses, in that many of their domestic 
inputs are sourced from KOBIs.  That impact will not be felt 
for some time, Yeoman predicted.  Yeoman\'s concerns with the 
measure focused more on its implications for public finances 
and for the encouragement it may give to Turkey\'s large 
\"shadow economy\" than for his industry\'s situation. 
 
 
4. (SBU)  Other major employers have been similarly sanguine. 
 Sabanci Holding\'s head of finance, Faruk Bilen, told us 
recently that he saw no impact on the holding from the 
decision, in that it too employs no minimum wage labor.  From 
a moral standpoint, he suggested that it is difficult to 
question the step, in that low-wage workers have borne the 
largest burden since the 2001 crisis, and the increase only 
allows them to partially recoup their losses.  At a time when 
the government spends nearly 70 quadrillion lira a year on 
interest payments, he suggested, a meager 2.6 quadrillion for 
increased wages at the lower end of the scale is hard to 
challenge. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Largely glossed over by employers now, but an 
unwritten subtext to their lack of militancy over the issue, 
is the fact that the actual increase came in much closer to 
their recommendations than to that desired by workers or even 
initially by the Prime Minister.  The 38 percent increase 
represents a rise from 226 million TL to 303 million TL. 
While clearly out of line with inflation targets, a point 
Istanbul brokerages have emphasized, it falls far short of 
the 100 percent increase (to 454 million TL) originally 
proposed by workers, or the 340 million TL (or 55 percent 
increase) advocated by the Prime Minister.  In fact, news 
reports during the commission\'s deliberations noted that the 
level proposed by employers was 300 million TL, virtually 
identical to the final figure.  Even TUSIAD Chairman Tuncay 
Ozilhan had publicly indicated that a rise of 20 percent 
would track with Turkey\'s 2004 inflation target, when coupled 
with an expected 7-8 percent increase in worker productivity. 
 Employers had also desired a 25 percent discount in social 
security premiums on the increase, and in fact achieved a 
government agreement to assume part of the burden of the 
increased social security taxes that would result, so that 
the actual increase to employers is 20 percent, precisely in 
line with Ozilhan\'s comments.  In fact, it is the fiscal 
impact of the government\'s agreement to assume part of the 
social security tax burden, rather than the minimum wage 
increase per se, that causes financial analysts here to worry. 
 
 
6. (U) If large employers have opted to avoid publicly 
criticizing the increase, Istanbul financial analysts have 
been less recalcitrant.  Leading brokerages such as 
HCIstanbul and Bender have criticized the increase\'s 
\"populist\" nature, and warned particularly about its 
implications for inflation, the shadow economy, and the 
government\'s budget.  While State Minister Babacan has been 
quick to stress that the Prime Minister identified 
compensating spending cuts to absorb the cost of the minimum 
wage and pension increases, most analysts were not impressed, 
with HCIstanbul, for instance, arguing that it will be 
\"practically impossible\" to find savings measures to balance 
the cost, which it estimated at 4.1 quadrillion (2.9 billion 
USD or 1 percent of GNP).  Hence its report on the issue 
concluded that the government would be forced to resort to 
tax measures or price hikes in the public sector, both of 
which would further encourage inflation.

2. (SBU) Summary: Shipping delays on the Bosphorus and 
Dardanelles straits have eased in recent days but the war of 
words surrounding the issue continues.  Russia\'s oil pipeline 
monopoly Transneft strongly criticized Turkish administration 
of the waterways earlier this week, and indicated that it is 
considering building a pipeline across Thrace that will 
bypass the problem.  For their part, Turkish officials 
strongly defend themselves, ascribing the problems to this 
winter\'s unusually bad weather (in the most recent storm last 
week four ships sank or ran aground in the approaches to the 
two straits) and to the doubling of oil exports via tanker 
from the Black Sea over the past seven years.  Both 
government and industry sources stress that the new VTS 
system is not a panacea and that traffic is at or near 
capacity.  End Summary. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Winter of Discontent: Recent months have constituted 
a winter of discontent for oil shippers using the Bosphorus 
and Dardanelles.  By some accounts, delays have averaged 20 
days for tankers to transit the two straits, with the longest 
waits in the approaches to the longer Dardanelles. 
Chevron/Texaco advisor Captain Kjell Ljandin told Embassy 
econoff that the worst moment occurred earlier this month 
when 42 ships were waiting in the Marmara Sea to pass  south 
through the Dardanelles.  With tanker rates in the 
Mediterranean at extremely high levels, the delays have 
translated into extra costs of 700,000 USD or more per 
shipment.  According to Transneft officials, they have also 
led to serious backups at Russia\'s Novorossisk oil terminal. 
Alper Aral, a manager at Ditas, the oil shipper owned by 
Turkish refinery Tupras, told us that because the delays 
cannot be predicted in advance, they have upset supply 
schedules and put upward pressure on already high tanker 
rates in the Mediterranean.  The problem does not affect 
Ditas\' shipments to Tupras\' Izmit refinery on the sea of 
Marmara, he said, since such shipments can \"jump the queue,\" 
but does affect shipments to refineries in Izmir.  Aral 
added, however, that blaming delays solely on the straits is 
misleading, in that the Russian port is often closed by bad 
weather as well.  Nonetheless, the Bosphorus delays do impose 
a significant cost on shippers, and according to Cem Koksal, 
the  Chief Financial Officer of the Zorlu Group, the Turkish 
partner in Tatneft\'s winning bid for Tupras, the ability to 
avoid them provided an additional incentive for the Russian 
oil company\'s decision to bid on the Turkish refiner. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Running at capacity: In press comments, Transneft 
officials have suggested that in addition to technical issues 
leading to shipping backlogs there are \"political issues\" as 
well, a charge strongly disputed by Turkish authorities. 
Instead, they point to the increase in oil volumes shipped 
over the last decadeto what they describe as the straits\' 
capacity.  Official figures document the dramatic increase. 
he amount rose from 124 million tons in 2002 to 13 million 
tons in 2003.  Most tellingly, the lattr total is more than 
twice 1997\'s total of 60 milion tons.  With these volumes, 
both government and industry sources describe the recent bad 
weather in European Turkey as he \"sraw tht broke the 
camel\'s back.\"  Indeed, n the most recent storm on February 
13-15, four ships sank or ran agroundin the approaches to 
th Bosphorus and Dardanelles, with the loss of 20 Cabodian 
and Bulgarian seamen. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Necessary Balance: Maritime Deput Undersecretary 
Sitki Ustaoglu stressed to Embasy econoffs tht evenwhen 
the new Vessel Traffic Syste (VTS)for te strats is fully 
operational it wa turne over o Turkey on a provisional 
bsis at the beginning of the year, though some unspcified 
problems remain that should be resolved by April), it will 
not solve the problem of shipping delays.  This point was 
echoed in Istanbul by Turkish Maritime Pilots Association 
(TKKD) Secretary General Cavit Istikbal, who argues that if 
the system is used to implement vessel spacing requirements, 
which heretofore have often been observed mostly in the 
breach, traffic could decline rather than increase.  (In the 
past, according to MFA officials, shippers often bribed 
straits officials to get around the transit rules, but now 
with electronic management this is no longer possible.)  In 
Istikbal\'s view, while the new system provides a useful 
documentary record of incidents that occur, it does not 
materially change the vessel transit system that has been in 
place since 1994, and so will not lead to increased traffic. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Upgrades: Istikbal said that planned implementation 
of an automatic ship reporting system may permit some 
increase in volume, since Maritime authorities will know 
sooner about approaching ships and will be better able to 
organize them.  But Ustaoglu noted that such organization may 
also require some unspecified changes in existing legislation 
and will not be implemented in the near future.  In essence, 
Istikbal described the current system as a delicate balancing 
act between safety requirements and traffic facilitation, in 
that the daylight and one-way traffic requirements for large 
(200 meter) tankers inevitably limit volumes (only six such 
tankers can be accommodated each day on the Bosphorus; the 
limit was raised to 7-8 on the Dardanelles at the end of 
January), but reflect a reasonable tradeoff since any 
accident in the straits could interrupt traffic for a 
protracted period.  Similarly, though Montreaux does not 
allow Turkey to require use of tugboats, Turkey has been able 
to encourage their use by allowing only one large tanker 
through a day without a tug.  The costs of waiting far 
outstrip the modest cost of the tug, so most large vessels 
acquiesce and employ one. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Bypass pipelines: The delays in the straits have led 
to renewed interest in pipeline projects to bypass them, 
especially since in most experts\' view the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan 
pipeline will only provide limited relief when it comes 
online next year (Istikbal estimated that BTC would only 
replace one of the six large tankers that transit the straits 
each day, and that new production would swiftly replace it). 
In press comments this week, Transneft indicated its interest 
in a pipeline across Thrace that would enable it to avoid 
both straits.  A source close to the Thrace bypass told us 
that the rising cost to shippers (delays and insurance) has 
convinced several oil companies that the Thrace bypass is an 
economically viable/cost effective alternative.  Zorlu\'s 
Koksal judged that the most currently feasible project would 
take oil to the Tupras refinery in Izmit from a point on 
Turkey\'s Black Sea coast.  He noted that this route could be 
built for a relative pittance (150 million USD), and would 
mostly parallel existing natural gas pipelines, so would have 
less right-of-way difficulties. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: Turkish maritime officials have told the 
Embassy that they are preparing a paper for the International 
Maritime Organization (IMO) on the straits, to follow up on 
their response last year to Russia\'s complaints (ref b). 
They stress, however, that they have no plans to change the 
Montreaux convention and that while legislative changes are 
planned, this will take time so that \"no quick fixes\" are in 
the works.  From the perspective of our Istanbul contacts, 
Turkey\'s measures to safeguard the straits strike a proper 
balance between Turkey\'s responsibilities under the 
convention and its responsibilities to its citizens, 
particularly given the impact an accident would have on the 
city and its inhabitants.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: CHALDEANS LEAVING IRAQ THROUGH ISTANBUL 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A significant number of Chaldean-Iraqis 
have left Iraq, and are currently taking refuge in Istanbul. 
Estimates vary on the size of the group, with Turkey\'s de 
facto Chaldean leader estimating 4,600, while Catholic relief 
Charity Caritas thinks around 1,500 refugees may currently be 
in Istanbul.  Adverse conditions in Iraq and pressure from 
other Iraqi ethnic groups appear to be the prime reason for 
the exodus.  The tiny local Chaldean community is overwhelmed 
by the number of new refugees.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Chaldeans Seeking Refuge 
------------------------ 
 
 
2. (SBU) Poloff met January 21 with Fr. Francois Yakan, 
Vicar-General of the Chaldeans of Turkey.  Due to the fact 
that the Chaldean Bishop of Turkey is very old and infirm, 
Yakan is the de facto leader of Turkey\'s tiny Chaldean 
community, constituting some 300 believers.  Yakan believes 
that there are currently 4,600 Chaldeans who have fled Iraq 
and are living in Istanbul.  Per Yakan, some are legally 
present in Turkey, others arrived legally but have overstayed 
their visa, and some illegally crossed into Turkey.  Most of 
these refugees are going to Canada and Australia, and a small 
number to the United States.  Yakan reports he was surprised 
to find that, in addition to Arabic and Chaldean, most of 
these refugees also speak English. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Yakan said that Turkish Chaldeans find themselves in 
a considerable bind because of the migration.  With such a 
tiny community, they have little to no means of assisting so 
many of their fellow believers.  Yakan himself has borrowed 
money from relatives to assist the refugees, and says he 
spends most of his time in the Istanbul Police Foreign 
Citizen\'s Section.  According to Yakan, Turkish police who 
arrest a Chaldean in Turkey illegally are willing to release 
the person to relatives or friends.  If none can be found, 
the detainee is returned to Iraq.  Yakan assists the refugees 
in filling out Turkish-language paperwork and finding 
relatives in Turkey. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Yakan\'s estimate of 4,600 refugees in Turkey may be 
inflated.  Francis Teoh at UNHCR-Ankara reports that they 
have had very few claims to refugee status from Iraq since 
the conflict began, and the number of those applying for 
refugee status is approximately the same as prior to the 
conflict.  Teoh reports that the MFA has assured him that 
there are no forcible deportations to Iraq.  Since refugees 
from Iraq can neither be resettled nor deported, their status 
after application with UNHCR is \"frozen.\"  However, UNHCR can 
provide applicants with letters indicating their refugee 
status, which may be helpful if the refugees are detained by 
Turkish police. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Caritas, a Catholic relief organization, reports 
that there is a sizeable community of Christian-Iraqi 
refugees in Istanbul, mostly Chaldeans and some Suriyanis. 
Per Caritas estimate, 304 families have applied to them for 
assistance.  Caritas estimates that the families are fairly 
large, averaging 5 people per family.  Caritas reports that 
the refugees come from various regions of Iraq, including 
North, South, and Baghdad. 
 
 
Need for Outside Assistance 
--------------------------- 
 
 
6. (SBU) Yakan says that outside support is being solicited 
from many other groups, with no assistance to date.  The 
Papal Nuncio in Istanbul has permitted the Chaldeans to use 
St. Antoine Church for services, due to the large number of 
worshippers.  Yakan is soliciting support from Chaldean 
communities abroad, which include approximately 270,000 
Chaldeans in the US and 80,000 in the EU.  Yakan will be 
attending meetings with European and American Chaldeans in 
Paris and Brussels in the near future to discuss possible 
assistance. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Ideally, Yakan would prefer that the Chaldeans not 
leave Iraq at all, as the community there (which he believes 
numbered 1 million before the most recent war) has shrunk to 
700,000 people.  Yakan believes discrimination by other 
minorities in Iraq, coupled with an unstable political 
situation, account for the migration.  Per Yakan, Kurds and 
Shi\'a in particular are making life uncomfortable for the 
Chaldeans, seeking to cement their own hold on various towns, 
and even jobs, by removing the Chaldeans already present. 
Yakan related one story of 3 Chaldean nurses in Kirkuk who 
were all fired form their jobs so that Kurds could be hired. 
 
 
Fears of a Wave to Come 
----------------------- 
 
 
8. (SBU) In tandem with Iraq\'s larger infrastructural 
problems, Chaldeans have been hit even harder, Yakan reports. 
 Chaldean schools and hospitals all are currently defunct, he 
says.  Yakan fears that, as Shi\'a and Kurds consolidate their 
hold, the Chaldeans will be more and more marginalized. 
Yakan fears that \"since Turkomans, Armenians, and others have 
whole countries paying attention to their minorities\' 
concerns, Chaldeans will be easily forgotten.\"

2.  (SBU) Summary: In a February 18 meeting with Econoff, 
Zorlu Group Chief Financial Officer Cem Koksal outlined the 
group\'s strategy for completion of the purchase of the 
Turkish refiner Tupras, predicting agreement with Turkey\'s 
Privatization Administration on a 60-day timeline for 
conclusion of the final share purchase agreement in coming 
days.  Koksal stressed that Zorlu entered the deal on the 
basis of equality with its Russian partner, Tatneft (which 
participated in the tender through a German subsidiary-- 
Efremov), and will contribute half of the purchase price.  He 
dismissed questions that have been raised about the partners\' 
ability to finance the deal, suggesting that the two 
companies will pay half of the 1.3 billion USD purchase price 
in cash and will finance the remainder through a consortium 
of Turkish and international banks.  Given existing 
management\'s ongoing 750 million USD investment program at 
Tupras, Koksal sees little need for the immediate injection 
of additional funds, though the new owners will try to speed 
up implementation of the program to ensure that the refinery 
meets E.U. standards when they come into force next year. 
End Summary. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Finishing Touches: Accepting congratulations on the 
group\'s success in the Tupras tender, Koksal noted that the 
timeline for completing the share purchase agreement between 
the winning bidders and the Turkish Privatization 
Administration should be finalized in coming days.  He noted 
that Zorlu\'s Russian partner Tatneft had initially wanted a 
90 day term, but would compromise on 60 days (in place of the 
usual 45).  He stressed that although Zorlu entered the 
process on the basis of full equality with Tatneft, and will 
split the purchase price 50-50, initially it will only have a 
minority 49 percent stake.  He ascribed this complication to 
the fact that Tatneft\'s initial bid envisioned a 51 percent 
share for Tatneft, and that this cannot be changed until the 
process is completed.  Any attempt to do so, he noted, would 
spark negative publicity that the group wants to avoid, 
particularly given the complaints about the process already 
voiced by the losing Cukorova Group.  It might also provide 
ammunition for legal challenges that will be mounted by labor 
opponents of the sale. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Financing: Koksal said that Zorlu and Tatneft will 
each put in 325 million in cash for an initial 650 million 
USD  downpayment, and will finance the rest from a consortium 
of Turkish and international banks.  The partners intend to 
pay the entire amount up front, he indicated, to \"put to 
rest\" rumors that the companies may not be able to meet their 
obligations, though he emphasized that they did not expect to 
receive a discount in the purchase price from the PA for 
doing so.  He noted that the financing on the installment 
plan offered by the PA, at 7 percent, was too high, and that 
since the group would need to finance the remainder in any 
case, it is better to do so in today\'s \"bullish\" markets. 
Koksal added that some part of Zorlu\'s downpayment would also 
be financed, though the bulk would come from contributions 
from various group companies.  Turkish banks, he said, are 
very interested in the deal, since they currently enjoy a 
strong equity base with excess liquidity.  They are also 
attracted by the prospect of regular business from Tupras, 
given that its banking activities will be channeled through 
financing banks.  Koksal noted that the group\'s financing 
focus is currently on large Turkish banks like Garanti and 
Isbank; the group\'s Denizbank will not participate to avoid 
any appearance of connected lending, and they would prefer to 
avoid using industry leader Akbank, with which the group does 
not have an existing relationship. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Tatneft: Koksal expressed little concern about the 
various legal challenges Zorlu\'s Russian partner faces, 
suggesting that such legal processes as shareholder 
consultation were required only if the company had 
participated directly in the tender.  Instead, by using its 
German subsidiary, Efremov, it had effectively shielded 
itself from these legal requirements.  Once the deal is 
completed, however, it would assume direct responsibility for 
it.  He hailed the project, suggesting that it represents 
Russia\'s biggest overseas investment and is equal in scope to 
the Blue Stream project.  He added that Tatneft\'s interest in 
Tupras stems in part from recent delays on the Bosporus, in 
that Tupras shipments are able to \"jump the queue\" and sail 
directly to the company\'s Izmit refinery.  The ability to 
avoid these delays was a powerful incentive for Tatneft, as 
is the fact that as part of the purchase the partners agreed 
that assuming that pricing and quality are equal, Tupras will 
first purchase oil from Tatneft.  (Earlier, managers at 
Ditas, Tupras\' tanker company, had told us that the company 
only sources 2.5 million tons of oil each year from Russia, 
with the bulk of its supplies coming from Iran and Syria.) 
 
 
6. (SBU) Labor woes: Koksal conceded that the purchase will 
confront challenges from organized labor, which he attributed 
more to the fear of the petroleum workers union (Petrol-Is) 
that it will continue to lose power and influence than to 
concern about job losses.  In fact, Koksal suggested, 
employment at Tupras is not far from world standards, and 
exceeds that level by only 10 percent or so.  Hence he does 
not anticipate major layoffs, believing instead that the 
labor force can be thinned mostly through attrition as 
workers retire.  He added that Zorlu had expected the legal 
challenges, but does not expect them to be successful. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Investment: Koksal stressed that Zorlu and Tatneft 
see little need for large immediate investments in their new 
acquisition.  A major capital investment program has been 
underway since 2001, he noted, and will total 750 million USD 
by 2006.  The bulk of this total (two-thirds) is dedicated to 
bringing Tupras\' diesel production into line with EU 
standards.  This is key to Tupras\' future, he argued, since 
under Turkey\'s new petroleum law, from next year distributors 
will be able to source 100 percent of their purchases from 
overseas, rather than the current 40 percent.  Implementation 
of EU standards, however, will create a natural entry barrier 
which will keep out cheaper low quality products, while 
Turkey will retain its competitive advantage against its 
European rivals.  He added that overall refineries in Izmit 
and Izmir are up to world standards, while the 
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline will bring new raw materials to 
the Kirikkale refinery.  The major question is Tupras\' oldest 
refinery at Batman in Turkey\'s southeast, which cannot be 
brought into compliance with EU sulphur rules.  Koksal noted 
that the government retains a golden share in the company, 
and the military may desire to keep this site operational for 
strategic reasons.  Koksal added that the new partners also 
have serious questions about Tupras\' plans for a new refinery 
in Izmit, believing that it may lead to excess capacity and 
would be a mistake, given that investments in refineries 
typically trade at half their \"book\" value.  He noted that 
the partners\' consultants have told them that Tupras capacity 
can increase from 25-26 million tons per year to 30 million 
tons simply by shifting production from \"black to white 
goods.\" 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: Koksal is Ahmet Zorlu\'s key advisor on 
financial and other issues, and as his comments reflect has 
been deeply involved in the group\'s strategy on the Tupras 
acquisition.  He noted too that the group is moving ahead on 
other fronts as well, planning to increase its volume of 
exports of white goods to Europe from 1.5 billion USD to 2.3 
billion.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: TURKISH FIRST ARMY COMMANDER ON US/TURKEY 
RELATIONS, CYPRUS, GME 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5(b&d) 
 
 
1. (u) Summary: During the course of a February 26 courtesy 
call by the Ambassador, First Army Commander General 
Buyukanit offered his views on U.S.-Turkish 
military-to-military relations, the ongoing Cyprus 
negotiations, and the Greater Middle East.  End Summary. 
 
 
Mil-Mil Relations 
----------------- 
2. (c) Buyukanit noted that the March 1, 2003, vote in the 
Turkish Parliament had been a major setback to relations.  As 
the then-Deputy Chairman of the Turkish General Staff (TGS), 
he recalled having worked around the clock for several days 
in the lead-up to the vote.  As a result, Buyukanit took it 
personally when Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz later 
\"criticized\" the Turkish military in a CNN Turk interview for 
not demonstrating sufficient leadership.  Buyukanit defended 
the TGS, but concluded that he saw the whole incident as a 
\"black spot\" on his career.  The Ambassador reassured the 
General that we understand there were many factors which 
contributed to the parliamentary vote and that Wolfowitz 
remains one of Turkey\'s strongest supporters. 
 
 
3. (c) The Ambassador added that much of the damage to the 
relationship has already been repaired with renewed contacts 
and a resumption of the High-Level Planning Group (HLPG) 
meetings.  Buyukanit expressed his satisfaction with the 
resumption of the HLPG meetings and suggested that such 
meetings adopt the broad, \"strategic\" focus that 
characterized the bilateral exchanges in the 1980s.  The 
Ambassador agreed and noted that the November HLPG had 
included such a discussion on Iraq.  Following up on these 
talks with other discussions between regular HLPG meetings 
would also be important to maintaining a healthy dialogue. 
The upcoming visit of DOD Jim Townsend to Turkey would be one 
such useful opportunity.  The June NATO Summit in Istanbul 
would be yet another opportunity for high-level discussions. 
 
 
Cyprus 
------ 
4. (c) Initially reluctant to comment on the ongoing 
negotiations in Cyprus (an issue on which he had spent 
\"years\" and had \"hundreds\" of meetings), Buyukanit did note 
that he sees the island as \"strategically\" important only as 
it relates to Turkey\'s EU membership.  \"What will happen if 
(there is a solution and) Turkey does not join the EU?,\" he 
asked.  As for the ongoing talks, Buyukanit urged caution to 
ensure that \"today\'s solutions not become tomorrow\'s 
problems.\"  With a few \"necessary modifications\" (nfi), the 
plan could work.  Moreover, Buyukanit added, \"I know\" that 
when UNSYG Annan sits down to \"fill in the blanks\" on the 
plan, that it is \"really the U.S. and the U.K.\" that will be 
calling the shots.  The Ambassador expressed confidence that 
Turkey will eventually be an EU member and that a durable 
Cyprus settlement can be found.  The U.S. has a role, the 
Ambassador admitted, but it would be UNSYG Annan who makes 
the final decisions on the details of unresolved elements of 
the plan. 
 
 
Greater Middle East 
------------------- 
5. (c) The Ambassador sketched the background and thinking 
that underlies a new USG focus and commitment to support 
democratic and economic reform in the Greater Middle East 
(GME).  Buyukanit agreed that Turkey would be one of the 
prime beneficiaries of greater stability and democracy in 
this region.  Disavowing the much-discussed notion that 
Turkey can be a \"model,\" Buyukanit argued that if the U.S. 
succeeds there, Iraq itself could be the model for Saudi 
Arabia, Syria, and other countries in the region.  Buyukanit 
singled out the Israeli-Palestinian dispute as particularly 
intractable and commented that the U.S. would have a critical 
role to play here and in the whole region.

1.  (U) Summary: Prosecutors at Istanbul\'s State Security 
Court on February 25 formally indicted 69 alleged 
conspirators in November\'s 4 terrorist attacks. 
Approximately 50 of the accused are now in custody.  However, 
a number of key figures, including the alleged leader of the 
Turkish al-Qaida cell, Habip Aktas, remain at large. 
Prosecutors indicated that the case against these individuals 
will be handled separately.  The indictment seeks life 
imprisonment for five of the suspects, and terms ranging from 
4.5 years to 22.5 years for the remainder.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) A Longstanding Plot: Based on what we have learned 
from news sources, the 128-page indictment describes a 
long-standing plot that developed over the course of a year 
and a half.  It suggests that the initial idea came from 
Habip Aktas, who it describes as the head of the \"Turkish 
section\" of al-Qaida, and asserts that he gained al-Qaida 
approval for his plan to stage attacks in Turkey after 
establishing contact with Al-Misri, head of the military 
branch of al-Qaida.  Initial targets included Incirlik Air 
Force Base and an Israeli vessel in Alanya, but these targets 
were ultimately deemed too difficult.  (Separate press 
reports cite Israeli intelligence officials as stating that 
the Israeli Consulate in Istanbul was also initially 
targeted, but abandoned it as it was also \"too hard a 
target.\")  The indictment states that the attacks cost 
150,000 USD, two-thirds of which came from al-Qaida members 
in Europe and the remainder from members in Iran.  Two 
indictees, Adnan Ersoz and Baki Yigit, allegedly met with 
Usama Bin Laden in Qandahar before 9/11; others were trained 
in al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
 
 
3. (U)  The indictment notes that members of the al-Qaida 
cell held a \"Vahabi-Selefi\" (Wahhabi-Salafi) version of 
Islam, which promotes a fundamentalist approach of literal 
interpretation of the Koran, does not consider Turks as 
Muslims and views Turkey itself as a \"dar-ul harp\" (\"house of 
war\"), or country against which jihad is legitimate. 
 
 
4. (U) Charges: In the final part of the indictment, the five 
members of the organization\'s leadership committee (Yusuf 
Polat, Adnan Ersoz, Fevzi Yitiz, Harun Ilhan and Osman Eken) 
are charged with \"attempting by force to abolish the 
constitutional system,\" with a penalty of life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole.  Two other defendents, 
Metin Ekinci and Suleyman Ugurlu (brother of one of the 
suicide bombers) are charged with \"participation in an 
attempt by force to abolish the constitutional system.\"  They 
face potential sentences of 7.5 to 22.5 years.  Two other 
defendents, Baki Yigit, who claimed to have met Bin Laden, 
and Seyit Ertul, who claimed to be the head of the Konya 
branch of the organization, were charged with \"leadership of 
an illegal organization\" and face a sentence of 22.5 years. 
45 of the remaining defendents are charged with \"membership 
in an illegal organization\" and face 15 to 22.5 years, while 
the remaining 15 defendants are charged with \"aiding and 
abetting\" the organization and face a lesser penalty of 4.5 
to 7.5 years.  The files of Aktas and those of his colleagues 
who are still at large were separated from the files of those 
in custody, and will be pursued separately. 
 
 
5. (U) Post is working with the security court to obtain a 
full text of the indictment and will forward it to Washington 
on receipt. 
 
 
6. (C) Embassy Comment: Sources in the intelligence branch of 
Turkish National Police in Ankara have told us one of the 
problems is a lack of files on an estimated several hundred 
Turks who reportedly received al-Qaida type training in 
Pakistan or Afghanistan.  They say part of the problem was a 
personnel shuffle carried out by the new AK Party government 
which sent experienced police intel officers from Istanbul to 
the provinces and at the same time a quiet policy of easing 
up on preventive measures against various radical Islamist 
groups.  While the indictment implies that the security 
services have the case well in hand, our sources are 
concerned that serious gaps remain in the effort to gain a 
grip on terrorist groups in Turkey.

SUBJECT: EXECUTIVES HIGHLIGHT BUOYANT STOCK MARKET BUT 
LAGGING INVESTMENT IN MEETINGS WITH AMBASSADOR 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: In meetings with Ambassador Edelman on 
February 26, executives at the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) 
and Foreign Investors\' Association (YASED) focused on two 
extremes of Turkey\'s current economic performance: the 
buoyant stock market, which has risen 80 percent over the 
last year, and Turkey\'s continued failure to attract foreign 
investment.  ISE leaders attributed positive market sentiment 
to increasing portfolio investment, lower interest rates, and 
the rising profits of ISE-traded companies, suggesting that 
continued commitment to Turkey\'s IMF program and structural 
reforms will further boost the market.  YASED President Saban 
Erdikler, however, criticized the government for its failure 
to move more aggressively on one key reform: improving 
Turkey\'s investment environment.  Since November 2003, he 
argued, nothing \"tangible\" has been done to attract foreign 
direct investment, in part due to the \"stronger than 
expected\" resistance of the Turkish bureaucracy.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) A Rising Market: In their meeting and lunch with 
Ambassador Edelman, ISE Senior Vice Chairman Aril Seren and 
Vice Chairman Huseyin Erkan stressed that Turkey\'s improving 
economic fundamentals have positively impacted the exchange. 
Falling interest rates, reduced inflation, and strong growth 
in 2003 led to a considerable increase in trading volume, as 
compared with the crisis year of 2001 and 2002.  Companies 
traded on the ISE, they noted, recorded a notable 176 percent 
jump in profits in 2003.  In addition, the strong Turkish 
lira and increased political and economic stability attracted 
portfolio investments from outside Turkey.  Interestingly, 
they argued that the bulk of this inflow was likely savings 
held outside the country by Turkish investors.  Although the 
exact amount is not known, they estimated that such external 
savings may be as high as 150 billion USD.  Seren added that 
decreasing profit margins in government papers due to lower 
interest rates makes the ISE more attractive for investors. 
Recent Capital Market Board decisions to make dividend 
payments compulsory and to apply international accounting 
standards further enhance the ISE\'s advantages as an 
investment alternative. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Room to Grow:  Seren and Erkan added that they 
believe there is still potential for a further rise in the 
exchange since company price/earnings ratios are still at 
reasonable levels.  Erkan added that the ISE\'s recent rise 
essentially represents recovery from 2001 and 2002\'s low 
levels.  Seren said they expect more IPO\'s in 2004 as trade 
volume grows.  The recent IPO of the Fenerbahce Football Club 
was very successful and encouraged other companies to follow 
suit.  Both executives agreed that a solution to the Cyprus 
conflict by May this year and a positive message from the 
European Union at the end of 2004 are critical for the 
Turkish economy and for healthy growth at the ISE. 
 
 
4. (SBU) No Investment: Less optimistic, however, was the 
prognosis of the leadership of the Foreign Investors\' 
Association (YASED).  Ambassador Edelman voiced his concern 
about the low level of direct foreign investment that Turkey 
receives despite its high potential and need, particularly in 
the energy, tourism, and transportation sectors.  He noted 
that Turkey\'s current FDI level of 400 million USD is far 
from adequate, a point YASED President Erdikler seconded. 
Erdikler argued that Turkey must target an annual FDI level 
of 30 billion by 2008. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Bureaucratic Resistance: Erdikler stressed that 
while YASED was initially encouraged by the AK government\'s 
commitment to improving the investment climate, and by the 
personal commitment of individual members of the government 
to investment issues, resistance by the Turkish bureaucracy 
had prevented any real improvement over the last year and a 
half.  He said YASED is disappointed by the recent lack of 
determination of the government, and was critical of the 
failure to keep pushing ahead to complete the remaining 
regulations concerning the investment environment. 
 
 
6. (SBU) March Investment Conference: Erdikler echoed his 
recent public criticism of organization of the mid-March 
Turkey Investment Promotion Conference, noting that the 
government had not coordinated with NGO\'s.  Only 16 
executives of major multinational companies responded, of 
whom 12 are CEO\'s.  YASED will take part in the conference 
and support the cause, he said, but he added that it will not 
be easy to convince executives to invest in Turkey at a time 
when Turkey cannot demonstrate success in resolving the 
problems of past investors.  The difficulties of Motorola, 
Nokia, and Cargill are closely followed by potential 
investors, he noted, as are IPR concerns, particularly those 
relating to pharmaceuticals. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Continuing Needs: Erdikler conceded that some steps 
have been taken by the AK government, including simplifying 
investment and company registration procedures.  Much remains 
to be done, however, including restructuring of the judicial 
system to meet the needs of the business community, and 
transparency in public services to establish confidence in 
the rule of law.  Erdikler added that long-term political and 
economic stability is the most critical factor for investment 
and agreed with his ISE counterparts that Turkey must both 
continue working with the IMF to complete needed structural 
reforms and with the EU to complete political preconditions 
for EU negotiations. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: Erdikler\'s disappointment is shared in 
other quarters, including domestic industry.  Istanbul 
Chamber of Industry President Tanil Kucuk echoed many of 
Erdikler\'s points in an eloquent address to the chamber\'s 
general assembly at the end of January, arguing that 2003 was 
\"not put to good use\" on the structural reform front. 
Seconding Erdikler\'s point about Turkey\'s need for 
investment, he warned that key indicators still remain below 
their 1997 levels, and that only new investment will permit 
Turkey to exceed them, as the economy has exhausted its 
ability to expand through productivity growth and increased 
capacity utilization.  End Comment.

Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Previously polarized and defined by their 
degree of support and sympathy for the PKK (later KADEK, now 
KONGRA-GEL) and imprisoned former PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, 
Istanbul Kurds tells us they have increasingly adopted Iraqi 
Kurds and their experiment with autonomy as their new cause 
celebre.  The ongoing efforts by the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) to 
secure a high degree of autonomy within a federal Iraq enjoy 
widespread support among Kurds in Istanbul.  This shift 
appears to have undermined some support in Istanbul for the 
PKK and for those who have traditionally adopted anti-U.S. 
positions (Embassy Note: We have not seen a similar shift 
among Kurds in Ankara or the Southeast. End Note).  Our 
Istanbul Kurdish contacts remain concerned, however, about 
the plight of their \"children in the mountains\" and disparage 
the Turkish government\'s inadequate PKK-related Reintegration 
Law and its overall policy on the Kurdish issue.  Pessimistic 
about the ongoing EU reform process and short-term prospects 
for a positive shift in government policy, moderate Kurds in 
Istanbul hope that when Ankara sees that an official Kurdish 
entity (as part of a federal Iraq) represents no threat to 
its interests, the Turkish Government and State will 
eventually be more forthcoming in response to local demands 
for Kurdish cultural rights.  End Summary. 
 
 
Istanbul: The Largest Kurdish City in the World 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
2. (C) With up to 2 million Kurds, Istanbul is, by most 
accounts, the largest Kurdish city in the world.  While many 
Kurds here and in other large Turkish cities enjoy more 
economic opportunities and a less oppressive political 
climate than Kurds in the Southeast, most of our contacts 
still say that \"in their hearts\" they aspire to an 
independent Kurdish state.  Few would ever choose to leave 
western Turkey, however, to return to an independent 
Southeast.  One Kurdish lawyer from Diyarbakir said, 
moreover, that if many in the Southeast were forced to choose 
between being able to hop on a bus to Istanbul and being 
confined to an \"independent Kurdistan,\" they too would 
reconsider their separatist aspirations.  Educated Kurds we 
have talked to are generally realistic and admit that they 
would be satisfied with true protection of their cultural and 
human rights, something to which they are convinced, however, 
that Ankara remains uncommitted. 
 
 
\"Winning the Peace\": Kurdish Cultural Rights 
-------------------------------------------- 
3. (C) The widespread view of Kurds in Istanbul is that the 
Turkish State distrusts the Kurds and systematically 
discriminates against them (ref A reports on similar views 
among Kurds in the Southeast).  They argue that the State and 
successive governments have never paid more than lip service 
to protecting Kurdish cultural rights.  Our Kurdish contacts 
see the recent reforms to allow Kurdish language instruction 
and broadcasting as the bare minimum required for Turkey\'s EU 
membership.  Moreover, they note that there has been little 
progress in implementing even these insufficient reforms. 
Sefik Beyaz, Chairman of the Istanbul Kurdish Institute (an 
organization that seeks to bring together disparate Kurdish 
groups to promote Kurdish culture) and also a left-wing 
alliance mayoral candidate for his home town Bitlis in 
Eastern Turkey, told poloff that implementation of these 
reforms is not \"sincere\" and that there have been no \"real 
steps\" taken.  On the importance of the language issue, 
however, Beyaz added that \"if you accept only one language 
(i.e., Turkish), you are condemning Kurdish and Kurdish 
culture to death.\" (Note: Despite recent reforms, no Kurdish 
language schools have begun classes to date, although this is 
expected to happen soon.  There are also no Kurdish-language 
broadcasts as yet under these reforms.  End Note). 
 
 
4. (C) ConGen\'s Kurdish contacts believe that neither the 
ruling AKP nor the opposition CHP have demonstrated a 
forward-leaning position or any creative thinking on the 
Kurdish issue.  Kemal Parlak, a former Istanbul Chairman of 
the Kurdish political party DEP, said that \"Kurdish Kurds\" 
were largely kept off the November 2002 party lists by both 
AKP and CHP.  Mustafa Ayzip, a prominent Kurdish lawyer and 
occasional human rights advocate, acknowledged current 
Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu\'s Kurdish origins, but 
pointed to his previous work as a police chief and governor 
in dismissing him as a \"product of the state.\"  (Note: Aksu\'s 
son Murat confessed to poloff separately that the family 
never spoke Kurdish at home. End note.)  This political 
disenfranchisement has contributed to a stifling of the 
public debate among the Kurdish community in Istanbul. 
Moderate Kurds who engage in political activity are routinely 
harassed, arrested, and often brought to trial by the state 
on little more than suspicion of affiliation with the PKK. 
Ironically, these same people are castigated and discredited 
within the Kurdish community by leftist, radical PKK 
sympathizers for their moderate policies.  As a result, there 
is a dearth of moderate leaders and an exchange of ideas 
within the Kurdish community. 
 
 
The PKK and Ocalan: Previously the Only Game in Town 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
5. (C) Until now debate among our Kurdish contacts in 
Istanbul has focused on the PKK and its now-imprisoned leader 
Abdullah Ocalan.  Istanbul reps of successive Kurdish 
political parties, including DEP, HEP, HADEP, and now DEHAP, 
are openly sympathetic to the PKK\'s separatist agenda and are 
widely believed to have informal links with the PKK itself. 
Other Kurdish organizations based in Istanbul, despite 
official harassment and legal challenges, have generally 
maintained their distance from the PKK, but remain 
battlegrounds for Kurdish intellectuals arguing over the 
extent to which they should show sympathy to a separatist 
agenda.  Hasan Kaya, the former chairman of the Kurdish 
Institute, told us last year that he resigned under pressure 
from more extremist members for his criticism of the Kurdish 
party DEHAP/HADEP and for not pursuing a more pro-PKK agenda. 
 DEMOS, a group of Istanbul Kurdish intellectuals that first 
came together in 1998 to seek a solution to the \"Kurdish 
issue,\" has been criticized and torn apart by debate on the 
same issue.  \"Ninety-five percent of Kurds do not agree with 
the PKK (and its methods), but many feel compelled to support 
(it) to a certain degree,\" Kaya claimed.  The PKK\'s lack of 
hard-core support, Kaya continued, is immediately obvious 
when one examines the public turnout for pro-Ocalan rallies 
(usually no more than a few thousand) and the annual Newroz 
(Kurdish New Year) celebrations (as many as 500,000).  That 
being said, \"even I don\'t want to be characterized as 
anti-PKK,\" Kaya confessed. 
 
 
A New Cause Celebre: Iraqi Kurdistan 
------------------------------------ 
6. (C) According to Kaya, Ayzit, Parlak and others, the 
U.S.-led intervention in Iraq has now completely changed the 
debate within the Kurdish community.  Although our contacts 
say that cultural and linguistic differences continue to 
separate them from Kurds in Iraq, they see Iraqi Kurdish 
aspirations for an ethnic federation as a proxy for their own 
unrealized ambitions.  The tantalizing prospect of a 
permanent, legal Kurdish autonomous entity (albeit within an 
Iraqi federation) has proved to be an inspiration and 
unifying cause for Turkish Kurds, our contacts assert.  Many 
of our contacts in Istanbul now also feel more comfortable in 
challenging the PKK\'s rhetoric.  Kemal Parlak indicated, for 
example, that he and others had disagreed with the PKK and 
HADEP when they labeled the PUK and KDP as \"collaborators and 
traitors.\"  Still others told us that the new focus on Iraq 
has undermined support in the Kurdish community for the PKK 
and for those adopting anti-U.S. positions.  Rusen Cakir, a 
columnist for Vatan newspaper and an expert on the Kurdish 
issue, told poloff that while support for the PKK among 
Turkish Kurds has decreased, Kurdish nationalism, including a 
sub-current of separatism, appears to be on the rise. 
 
 
7. (C) This sympathy for Iraqi Kurds underlies the logic that 
our contacts assert led most Istanbul Kurds to support the 
U.S.-led intervention (although most Turks did not), but to 
oppose a parliamentary measure that would have allowed Turkey 
to deploy troops to northern Iraq.  (Embassy Note: Embassy 
Kurdish contacts in Ankara and the Southeast asserted that 
Kurds in the Southeast opposed the invasion, if only out of 
fear of a Turkish crackdown in the Southeast and Northern 
Iraq.  After the Iraqi regime was routed, without a Turkish 
military incursion and with Kurdish support, they began to 
tell us it had been a good thing after all  End Note). 
Istanbul Kurds also split with their fellow Turkish citizens 
upon hearing reports of ethnic clashes between Iraqi Kurds 
and Turkmen in Kirkuk.  Many Istanbul Kurds were upset that 
Turkey appears to be cooperating with Syria and Iran to 
oppose Kurdish demands in Iraq and are now worried about 
reports that the U.S. may pressure the Kurds to back down as 
well.  More than one Kurdish contact has remarked to us that 
\"nobody\" seems to question Palestinian demands for an 
independent state or Turkish Cypriot demands for an 
\"ethnically-divided confederation,\" but that Kurdish 
aspirations are always seen as overreaching. 
\"Our Fates Are Intertwined\" 
--------------------------- 
8. (C) Looking forward, our contacts are nervous that Kurdish 
aspirations may once again be frustrated, but are also 
cautiously optimistic that developments in Northern Iraq 
could have a positive impact on their situation in Turkey. 
The \"positive scenario\" that our contacts have laid out 
envisions Turkey at peace with a \"Kurdish neighbor\" within a 
federal Iraq.  Our contacts say that when Turkey\'s worst 
fears about Kurdish separatism go unrealized, they hope that 
the Turkish state will change its fundamental approach 
towards its own Kurdish population.  The \"negative scenario\" 
centers on a clash between Iraqi Kurdish demands for autonomy 
and/or Kirkuk and Turkey\'s opposition.  The ethnic conflict 
that may ensue if the Iraqi Kurds feel that they are being 
forgotten \"once again\" will exacerbate tensions among the 
Istanbul Kurdish community and harden Turkey\'s stance on the 
Kurdish issue. 
 
 
9. (C) Most Istanbul Kurds we have spoken with believe that 
the U.S. will play the determining role as this drama 
unfolds.  \"We have cast our lot with (the U.S.),\" Mustafa 
Ayzit explained.  Our contacts are less specific, however, 
when it comes to the details of the Kurdish demands for 
autonomy in northern Iraq.  Kirkuk appears to be a powerful 
symbol of Kurdish identity, but most stopped short of 
insisting that its inclusion in a Kurdish region was a sine 
qua non (one mentioned interim international administration 
of the city as a possible compromise).  The unresolved issue 
of PKK militants in Iraq is also a major concern.  While many 
we spoke to harbor little sympathy for the PKK leadership, 
most feel that any military action against their \"children in 
the mountains\" (i.e., the rank and file) would prompt 
widespread outrage and condemnation among the Kurdish 
community here.  Despite the failure of last year\'s 
Reintegration Law (ref B), all of our Kurdish contacts 
expressed the firm belief that a \"genuine\" amnesty would 
solve the problem. 
 
 
10. (C) Comment: Most Kurdish contacts in Istanbul credit the 
U.S. with giving Iraqi Kurds an opportunity to achieve 
long-standing aspirations for cultural identity.  Our 
contacts believe that the outcome of the ongoing developments 
in Iraq will be more significant for their own future in 
Turkey than any ongoing domestic reforms or even Turkey\'s EU 
membership process.

SUBJECT: FUROR OVER ATATURK\'S DAUGHTER\'S ARMENIAN ANCESTRY 
EXPOSES TURKISH RACISM 
 
 
1. (sbu) Summary: Recent claims reported in two Turkish 
newspapers that the late Sabiha Gokcen -- Ataturk\'s adopted 
daughter and Turkey\'s first female pilot -- was Armenian have 
exposed an ugly streak of racism in Turkish society.  The 
reports led a number of prominent figures to make racist 
remarks \"defending\" Gokcen, which in turn prompted criticism 
from more open-minded columnists.  Perhaps the most alarming 
result, however, has been an intensely personal campaign by 
die-hard nationalists against the editor of the Armenian 
weekly newspaper that first broke the story.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (u) On February 21, the Hurriyet daily newspaper reprinted 
a claim that had been published two weeks earlier in the 
Armenian weekly newspaper AGOS to the effect that Sabiha 
Gokcen, the adopted daughter of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and 
Turkey\'s first female pilot, was of Armenian descent.  The 
claim, based on genealogical research by one of Gokcen\'s 
descendants, is not considered particularly new or noteworthy 
among Armenian circles.  Nevertheless, its widespread 
circulation in Hurriyet prompted many prominent figures to 
make racist and insulting remarks: 
 
 
-- Hurriyet columnist Emin Colasan wrote two editorials last 
week on the subject.  Colasan asks why such claims were put 
forward when it is obvious that \"dead people can\'t defend 
themselves\" against such \"slander and lies.\" 
 
 
-- The Turkish Air Association (founded by Ataturk to promote 
the Turkish Air Force) released a statement describing the 
\"completely fabricated and unfounded\" reports \"not merely as 
an insult to Gokcen, but also as an insult to Ataturk.\" 
 
 
-- The Turkish General Staff (TGS) issued a statement 
criticizing the reports regarding Gokcen\'s ethnic origin as 
an \"unfounded and unfair campaign against Ataturk 
nationalism\" and \"a claim that abuses national values and 
feelings.\" 
 
 
(Note: In contrast to the TGS statement, Aegean Army 
Commander General Hurshit Tolon earlier commented that if 
Gokcen was Armenian, it is important proof of the \"greatness\" 
of Turkish nationalism and Ataturk\'s vision.  \"It means\" he 
said, \"that Ataturk understood many years ago that ethnic 
origin has no importance in a globalizing world.\"  End Note). 
 
 
3. (u) Others, including columnists Oktay Eksi (Hurriyet) and 
Sahin Alpay (Zaman), criticized the racist tone of these 
responses.  Alpay put his finger on the crux of the 
controversy in his February 28 column. \"Because Turkish 
identity has been defined... as \"those who adopt Turkish 
culture, share Islamic beliefs, and speak Turkish,\" anybody 
falling outside this definition was not considered part of 
national society.  While these politics may have been 
unavoidable during the republic\'s formation, in today\'s 
circumstances they represent a threat to Turkey\'s national 
unity and territorial integrity... In order to achieve the 
ideal of a modern, free, and democratic Turkey, we need to 
accept that no matter their language or religion, everyone 
with citizenship and a bond of devotion to the Turkish 
Republic is a Turk.\" 
 
 
4. (sbu) More worrying than this exchange is the fact that 
the publication of these claims has led die-hard nationalist 
members of the Istanbul branch of the Nationalist Action 
Party-affiliated \"ideological hearths\" to launch a personal 
campaign attacking Hrant Dink, the editor of AGOS.  While 
Dink has not been specifically criticized for publishing the 
story on Gokcen, the publicity it generated prompted some 
nationalists to use a previous Dink editorial to label him as 
a \"traitor.\"  (Note: In the article in question, Dink urges 
Armenians to put aside their poisonous obsession with Turks 
and the \"genocide\" and to focus instead on Armenia and 
develop a positive Armenian identity.  He is accused of 
labeling Turks as \"poisonous.\"  End Note).  This campaign has 
so far included hostile phone calls to Dink and a February 26 
demonstration outside the AGOS offices by 40 or so 
aggressive, taunting protesters.  Clearly distraught and 
upset by the attacks, Dink confessed to poloff that he has 
even considered abandoning the newspaper. 
 
 
5. (sbu) Comment: These developments spotlight the racism 
underlying Turkish nationalism.  The outrage by Turkey\'s 
secular establishment also reflects its hyper-sensitivity to 
any perceived attacks on Kemalist ideology.  We can expect 
that any attempt to debate establishment-imposed notions of 
secularism or the meaning of Turkishness will continue to

REF: A) 03 ANKARA 6163 AND 4315 B) 03 ANKARA 4499 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Previously polarized and defined by their 
degree of support and sympathy for the PKK (later KADEK, now 
KONGRA-GEL) and imprisoned former PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, 
Istanbul Kurds tells us they have increasingly adopted Iraqi 
Kurds and their experiment with autonomy as their new cause 
celebre.  The ongoing efforts by the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) to 
secure a high degree of autonomy within a federal Iraq enjoy 
widespread support among Kurds in Istanbul.  This shift 
appears to have undermined some support in Istanbul for the 
PKK and for those who have traditionally adopted anti-U.S. 
positions (Embassy Note: We have not seen a similar shift 
among Kurds in Ankara or the Southeast. End Note).  Our 
Istanbul Kurdish contacts remain concerned, however, about 
the plight of their \"children in the mountains\" and disparage 
the Turkish government\'s inadequate PKK-related Reintegration 
Law and its overall policy on the Kurdish issue.  Pessimistic 
about the ongoing EU reform process and short-term prospects 
for a positive shift in government policy, moderate Kurds in 
Istanbul hope that when Ankara sees that an official Kurdish 
entity (as part of a federal Iraq) represents no threat to 
its interests, the Turkish Government and State will 
eventually be more forthcoming in response to local demands 
for Kurdish cultural rights.  End Summary. 
 
 
Istanbul: The Largest Kurdish City in the World 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
2. (C) With up to 2 million Kurds, Istanbul is, by most 
accounts, the largest Kurdish city in the world.  While many 
Kurds here and in other large Turkish cities enjoy more 
economic opportunities and a less oppressive political 
climate than Kurds in the Southeast, most of our contacts 
still say that \"in their hearts\" they aspire to an 
independent Kurdish state.  Few would ever choose to leave 
western Turkey, however, to return to an independent 
Southeast.  One Kurdish lawyer from Diyarbakir said, 
moreover, that if many in the Southeast were forced to choose 
between being able to hop on a bus to Istanbul and being 
confined to an \"independent Kurdistan,\" they too would 
reconsider their separatist aspirations.  Educated Kurds we 
have talked to are generally realistic and admit that they 
would be satisfied with true protection of their cultural and 
human rights, something to which they are convinced, however, 
that Ankara remains uncommitted. 
 
 
\"Winning the Peace\": Kurdish Cultural Rights 
-------------------------------------------- 
3. (C) The widespread view of Kurds in Istanbul is that the 
Turkish State distrusts the Kurds and systematically 
discriminates against them (ref A reports on similar views 
among Kurds in the Southeast).  They argue that the State and 
successive governments have never paid more than lip service 
to protecting Kurdish cultural rights.  Our Kurdish contacts 
see the recent reforms to allow Kurdish language instruction 
and broadcasting as the bare minimum required for Turkey\'s EU 
membership.  Moreover, they note that there has been little 
progress in implementing even these insufficient reforms. 
Sefik Beyaz, Chairman of the Istanbul Kurdish Institute (an 
organization that seeks to bring together disparate Kurdish 
groups to promote Kurdish culture) and also a left-wing 
alliance mayoral candidate for his home town Bitlis in 
Eastern Turkey, told poloff that implementation of these 
reforms is not \"sincere\" and that there have been no \"real 
steps\" taken.  On the importance of the language issue, 
however, Beyaz added that \"if you accept only one language 
(i.e., Turkish), you are condemning Kurdish and Kurdish 
culture to death.\" (Note: Despite recent reforms, no Kurdish 
language schools have begun classes to date, although this is 
expected to happen soon.  There are also no Kurdish-language 
broadcasts as yet under these reforms.  End Note). 
 
 
4. (C) ConGen\'s Kurdish contacts believe that neither the 
ruling AKP nor the opposition CHP have demonstrated a 
forward-leaning position or any creative thinking on the 
Kurdish issue.  Kemal Parlak, a former Istanbul Chairman of 
the Kurdish political party DEP, said that \"Kurdish Kurds\" 
were largely kept off the November 2002 party lists by both 
AKP and CHP.  Mustafa Ayzip, a prominent Kurdish lawyer and 
occasional human rights advocate, acknowledged current 
Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu\'s Kurdish origins, but 
pointed to his previous work as a police chief and governor 
in dismissing him as a \"product of the state.\"  (Note: Aksu\'s 
son Murat confessed to poloff separately that the family 
never spoke Kurdish at home. End note.)  This political 
disenfranchisement has contributed to a stifling of the 
public debate among the Kurdish community in Istanbul. 
Moderate Kurds who engage in political activity are routinely 
harassed, arrested, and often brought to trial by the state 
on little more than suspicion of affiliation with the PKK. 
Ironically, these same people are castigated and discredited 
within the Kurdish community by leftist, radical PKK 
sympathizers for their moderate policies.  As a result, there 
is a dearth of moderate leaders and an exchange of ideas 
within the Kurdish community. 
 
 
The PKK and Ocalan: Previously the Only Game in Town 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
5. (C) Until now debate among our Kurdish contacts in 
Istanbul has focused on the PKK and its now-imprisoned leader 
Abdullah Ocalan.  Istanbul reps of successive Kurdish 
political parties, including DEP, HEP, HADEP, and now DEHAP, 
are openly sympathetic to the PKK\'s separatist agenda and are 
widely believed to have informal links with the PKK itself. 
Other Kurdish organizations based in Istanbul, despite 
official harassment and legal challenges, have generally 
maintained their distance from the PKK, but remain 
battlegrounds for Kurdish intellectuals arguing over the 
extent to which they should show sympathy to a separatist 
agenda.  Hasan Kaya, the former chairman of the Kurdish 
Institute, told us last year that he resigned under pressure 
from more extremist members for his criticism of the Kurdish 
party DEHAP/HADEP and for not pursuing a more pro-PKK agenda. 
 DEMOS, a group of Istanbul Kurdish intellectuals that first 
came together in 1998 to seek a solution to the \"Kurdish 
issue,\" has been criticized and torn apart by debate on the 
same issue.  \"Ninety-five percent of Kurds do not agree with 
the PKK (and its methods), but many feel compelled to support 
(it) to a certain degree,\" Kaya claimed.  The PKK\'s lack of 
hard-core support, Kaya continued, is immediately obvious 
when one examines the public turnout for pro-Ocalan rallies 
(usually no more than a few thousand) and the annual Newroz 
(Kurdish New Year) celebrations (as many as 500,000).  That 
being said, \"even I don\'t want to be characterized as 
anti-PKK,\" Kaya confessed. 
 
 
A New Cause Celebre: Iraqi Kurdistan 
------------------------------------ 
6. (C) According to Kaya, Ayzit, Parlak and others, the 
U.S.-led intervention in Iraq has now completely changed the 
debate within the Kurdish community.  Although our contacts 
say that cultural and linguistic differences continue to 
separate them from Kurds in Iraq, they see Iraqi Kurdish 
aspirations for an ethnic federation as a proxy for their own 
unrealized ambitions.  The tantalizing prospect of a 
permanent, legal Kurdish autonomous entity (albeit within an 
Iraqi federation) has proved to be an inspiration and 
unifying cause for Turkish Kurds, our contacts assert.  Many 
of our contacts in Istanbul now also feel more comfortable in 
challenging the PKK\'s rhetoric.  Kemal Parlak indicated, for 
example, that he and others had disagreed with the PKK and 
HADEP when they labeled the PUK and KDP as \"collaborators and 
traitors.\"  Still others told us that the new focus on Iraq 
has undermined support in the Kurdish community for the PKK 
and for those adopting anti-U.S. positions.  Rusen Cakir, a 
columnist for Vatan newspaper and an expert on the Kurdish 
issue, told poloff that while support for the PKK among 
Turkish Kurds has decreased, Kurdish nationalism, including a 
sub-current of separatism, appears to be on the rise. 
 
 
7. (C) This sympathy for Iraqi Kurds underlies the logic that 
our contacts assert led most Istanbul Kurds to support the 
U.S.-led intervention (although most Turks did not), but to 
oppose a parliamentary measure that would have allowed Turkey 
to deploy troops to northern Iraq.  (Embassy Note: Embassy 
Kurdish contacts in Ankara and the Southeast asserted that 
Kurds in the Southeast opposed the invasion, if only out of 
fear of a Turkish crackdown in the Southeast and Northern 
Iraq.  After the Iraqi regime was routed, without a Turkish 
military incursion and with Kurdish support, they began to 
tell us it had been a good thing after all  End Note). 
Istanbul Kurds also split with their fellow Turkish citizens 
upon hearing reports of ethnic clashes between Iraqi Kurds 
and Turkmen in Kirkuk.  Many Istanbul Kurds were upset that 
Turkey appears to be cooperating with Syria and Iran to 
oppose Kurdish demands in Iraq and are now worried about 
reports that the U.S. may pressure the Kurds to back down as 
well.  More than one Kurdish contact has remarked to us that 
\"nobody\" seems to question Palestinian demands for an 
independent state or Turkish Cypriot demands for an 
\"ethnically-divided confederation,\" but that Kurdish 
aspirations are always seen as overreaching. 
 
 
\"Our Fates Are Intertwined\" 
--------------------------- 
8. (C) Looking forward, our contacts are nervous that Kurdish 
aspirations may once again be frustrated, but are also 
cautiously optimistic that developments in Northern Iraq 
could have a positive impact on their situation in Turkey. 
The \"positive scenario\" that our contacts have laid out 
envisions Turkey at peace with a \"Kurdish neighbor\" within a 
federal Iraq.  Our contacts say that when Turkey\'s worst 
fears about Kurdish separatism go unrealized, they hope that 
the Turkish state will change its fundamental approach 
towards its own Kurdish population.  The \"negative scenario\" 
centers on a clash between Iraqi Kurdish demands for autonomy 
and/or Kirkuk and Turkey\'s opposition.  The ethnic conflict 
that may ensue if the Iraqi Kurds feel that they are being 
forgotten \"once again\" will exacerbate tensions among the 
Istanbul Kurdish community and harden Turkey\'s stance on the 
Kurdish issue. 
 
 
9. (C) Most Istanbul Kurds we have spoken with believe that 
the U.S. will play the determining role as this drama 
unfolds.  \"We have cast our lot with (the U.S.),\" Mustafa 
Ayzit explained.  Our contacts are less specific, however, 
when it comes to the details of the Kurdish demands for 
autonomy in northern Iraq.  Kirkuk appears to be a powerful 
symbol of Kurdish identity, but most stopped short of 
insisting that its inclusion in a Kurdish region was a sine 
qua non (one mentioned interim international administration 
of the city as a possible compromise).  The unresolved issue 
of PKK militants in Iraq is also a major concern.  While many 
we spoke to harbor little sympathy for the PKK leadership, 
most feel that any military action against their \"children in 
the mountains\" (i.e., the rank and file) would prompt 
widespread outrage and condemnation among the Kurdish 
community here.  Despite the failure of last year\'s 
Reintegration Law (ref B), all of our Kurdish contacts 
expressed the firm belief that a \"genuine\" amnesty would 
solve the problem. 
 
 
10. (C) Comment: Most Kurdish contacts in Istanbul credit the 
U.S. with giving Iraqi Kurds an opportunity to achieve 
long-standing aspirations for cultural identity.  Our 
contacts believe that the outcome of the ongoing developments 
in Iraq will be more significant for their own future in 
Turkey than any ongoing domestic reforms or even Turkey\'s EU 
membership process.

SUBJECT: ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH APPOINTS NON-TURKS TO CHURCH 
SYNOD 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In an attempt to ensure the viability of 
his institution in the face of the declining Orthodox 
community in Turkey, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, 
first among equals in the Orthodox world, appointed six 
non-Turkish citizen metropolitans to the church\'s Holy Synod. 
 The twelve-person body has ultimate authority over 
theological policies of the patriarchate and the eventual 
election of Bartholomew\'s successor.  Though the Treaty of 
Lausanne and other legal precedents suggest no direct problem 
with the appointments, the move raised the ire of Turkish 
secularist nationalists and sparked a wave of attention in 
the Turkish press.  How the Turkish Government and State (not 
always the same thing) respond to the appointments will be a 
test of Turkey\'s understanding of, and willingness to 
practice, religious freedom.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
\"Metropolitan Crisis\" 
--------------------- 
 
 
2. (U) Bartholomew\'s move represented the first time in the 
80-year history of the Republic of Turkey that non-citizens 
have been included in the Synod.  The six new appointments to 
the 12-member body, which went into effect on March 1, 
include metropolitans from Greece (Crete and Rhodes), the UK, 
New Zealand, Finland, and the United States (Metropolitan 
Demetrios).  Six Turkish citizens remain members.  The 
appointments sparked a flurry of attention in the Turkish 
press, with several articles alleging that the Patriarch was 
in violation of the Lausanne Treaty.  To date, Bartholomew 
has been careful to avoid the appearance of \"challenging\" the 
Turkish state, and has not yet responded to many requests for 
interviews on the subject. 
 
 
3. (U) However, as a number of press commentators pointed out 
below the sensational headlines, the Treaty of Lausanne makes 
no mention of either the Patriarch or of the Holy Synod, nor 
does it discuss the nationality of people serving in 
theological capacities in Turkey.  In fact, the well-known 
requirement that the Patriarch and those who elect him be 
Turkish citizens dates from a 1923 edict from the Istanbul 
Governor\'s office, and is thus not formal Turkish 
legislation.  Since that time, no non-Turkish citizens have 
been Synod members, though the current Patriarch\'s 
predecessor, Athenagoras, was a U.S. citizen who was 
automatically naturalized upon arrival in Istanbul in 1948. 
It is noteworthy that Athenagoras\' situation was a unique 
confluence of interests, in that his Patriarchal status was 
approved by Greece, Turkey, and the United States.  He 
reportedly arrived in Turkey on a plane lent to him by 
then-President Harry Truman. 
 
 
4. (U) Press coverage, while initially somewhat 
sensationalist, has not been bombastic.  However, a series of 
inaccuracies in press reporting has clouded the issue. 
Papers variously (and inaccurately) have reported that: the 
new appointees have been \"hired\" by the Patriarch and will 
work in Turkey; the appointees will live in Turkey and cannot 
simply enter as tourists; Turkish citizens were \"removed\" to 
make way for foreigners (partially true: the previous 
incumbents were too old or infirm to carry out their duties, 
and were retired); the appointments are a direct 
contravention of the Lausanne Treaty (no specific articles 
cited). 
 
 
Demographic and Political Concerns 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
5. (SBU) Poloff met March 6 with Metropolitan Meliton, Chief 
Secretary of the Holy Synod.  Per Meliton, the appointments 
 
SIPDIS 
were intended as one way to deal with Turkey\'s shrinking 
Greek community.  With around 2,000 Greeks left in Turkey, 
few able Metropolitans remain.  The six newly-appointed Synod 
members are filling spots previously held by Turkish citizens 
now too old and infirm to participate effectively.  Though 
none of the new appointees are young, per Meliton, 
establishing a precedent for non-Turkish citizen 
participation in the Synod is crucial to the continuance of 
the patriarchate in Turkey.  Meliton reports that in August 
2003, prior to the new appointments, the Patriarch sent 
letters to both the MFA and Prime Minister\'s office which 
outlined his proposal for putting non-Turkish citizens on the 
Synod.  No reply has been received to date. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Though neither the GoT nor any organ of the Turkish 
State (e.g. the MFA) has given a public reaction to date, 
Meliton says he has heard that both the Turkish National 
Intelligence Organization (MIT) and other portions of the 
Turkish security establishment are unhappy with the new 
appointments.  Separately, former Foreign Minister Ilter 
Turkmen confirmed to poloff that some within the GoT will 
find the appointments objectionable, and expressed some 
surprise that the Ministry of the Interior hasn\'t spoken out 
to date.  Turkmen speculated that there may be legal problems 
with the appointments, though he said he was not an expert in 
minority legal matters. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
7. (SBU) The appointment of six non-Turkish citizens to the 
Synod is a bid to lengthen the life-span of the patriarchate 
in Istanbul.  With only 2,000 Greeks left, finding qualified 
senior theologians in Turkey is becoming impossible. 
Appointing foreigners to these posts also strengthens the 
Patriarch\'s hand within the larger Orthodox world, and helps 
the Patriarch appear in touch with his far-flung communities. 
 The appointments represent no threat to Turkey\'s interests; 
indeed, by strengthening the Ecumenical Partriarchate, Turkey 
enhances its position.  However, elements of the Turkish 
secularist-nationalist establishment are likely to challenge 
the appointments.  Demonstrating flexibility toward the needs 
of Turkey\'s minorities could be very beneficial in the run-up 
to possible EU accession talks.  But, by choosing a path of 
continuing intransigence on Halki, refusal to recognize the 
ecumenical status of the patriarchate, and objection to 
participation in the Holy Synod by non-Turkish citizens, the 
Turkish establishment is shooting itself in the foot.

SUBJECT: ARMENIAN PATRIARCH DISCUSSES ONGOING CONCERNS 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David L. Arnett for reasons 1.4 (b) and ( 
 
 
d). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II believes the 
run-up to a decision for Turkey on EU accession in December 
provides the best opportunity in years to get movement from 
the GoT on a variety of problems faced by minority 
communities, including church administration and property 
issues, clerical education, and security concerns.  To date 
Mesrob believes little real change has been effected, 
although Istanbul police have acted quickly against a website 
encouraging violent attacks against his community.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (C) Consul General met with Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II, 
still recovering from a serious traffic accident, on March 
12.  Mesrob provided thoughtful insight into the challenges 
faced by the Armenian Orthodox Community in particular, and 
minority religions in general, in working with the Turkish 
bureaucracy.  Mesrob remains hopeful that there will be 
\"positive changes in the near future, despite a recent 
hardening of GoT attitudes in some areas.\" 
 
 
How to Keep an Empty Church 
--------------------------- 
 
 
3. (U) Under current General Directorate of Foundations 
(Vakiflar Genel Mudurlugu, VGM) regulations, each church or 
synagogue in Turkey must have an administering foundation, 
typically a board of directors made up of parishioners.  In 
areas of Turkey where the population of a given minority is 
dwindling, it can often be impossible to find the minimum 
number of people (typically six) needed to administer the 
church or synagogue foundation in that locality.  Should the 
number fall below the minimum, the VGM eventually takes title 
to the church or synagogue, and any attached property, 
ostensibly for the purpose of safeguarding the property. 
 
 
4. (C) In practice, this safeguarding constitutes, at best, 
neglect.  The VGM has little money for use in the upkeep of 
vacant churches.  In several cases, churches taken over by 
the VGM were used in ways that were objected to by the 
minority community.  Minority communities have also alleged 
that VGM officials have used former church properties to 
enrich themselves or their friends. 
 
 
5. (U) As a possible remedy to the situation, Armenian and 
Jewish Community representatives have proposed on several 
occasions not requiring that board members be resident in the 
same district (ilce) as the church or synagogue.  Though GoT 
authorities have shown some flexibility, allowing residents 
of the same province (particularly in Istanbul) to serve on 
boards of foundations in districts other than their own, this 
has not extended to Turkey as a whole.  Mesrob believes that 
by allowing board members to serve on foundations elsewhere 
in Turkey, the churches and synagogues could better address 
their desire to preserve historically-significant, but not 
regularly-used, houses of worship. 
 
 
6. (C) In particular, Mesrob points to the Church of St. 
Gregory the Illuminator in Kayseri.  This church, built in 
what was believed to be the home town of St. Gregory (who 
converted the Armenians to Christianity, leading to Armenia 
becoming the first officially Christian state), has major 
historical significance for Armenians everywhere.  If the VGM 
were to take over, and then neglect or misuse the property, 
the Armenian Diaspora would object strenuously and publicly, 
he believes.  Though he has expressed such concerns directly 
to the GoT, no response has been forthcoming to his proposal 
for expanding eligibility for foundation board participation. 
 
 
No Halki for Armenians 
---------------------- 
 
 
7. (C) Mesrob discussed the status of the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate\'s negotiations with the GoT on reopening of 
Halki Seminary.  Mesrob believes that such negotiations have 
reached am impasse because the Greeks want the seminary to be 
classified as a \"vocational school,\" something which would 
not/not put Halki under the authority of the Higher Board of 
Education (YOK).  (Note: Vocational schools still fall under 
the Ministry of Education.  Mesrob did not elaborate as to 
why the government preferred YOK as the appropriate 
authority.) 
 
 
8. (SBU) Though the Armenian Orthodox Community also has 
now-defunct seminaries which it could reopen if it also 
reached an agreement with the Ministry of Education and YOK, 
Mesrob says he has no desire to do so.  Mesrob says he 
intends to work with YOK to create some sort of theological 
faculty which would train future Armenian priests and 
teachers, as well as outsiders with an academic interest in 
Orthodox theology, for two years only.  He then hopes to send 
the candidates for the priesthood overseas for further, and 
more intensive, training. 
9. (SBU) Mesrob\'s attitude is the result of financial 
concerns.  He estimates that reopening a seminary in Istanbul 
would cost USD 400,000 per year.  Sending an average of 8-10 
students per year overseas for theological training costs USD 
15,000 to 20,000 per student, resulting in a net savings of 
USD 200,000 to 280,000.  Though Mesrob\'s proposal seems much 
closer to the Ministry of Education and YOK\'s wishes, there 
is no GoT movement to date. 
 
 
Internet Threats Ended 
---------------------- 
 
 
10. (C) Mesrob had previously raised with poloff security 
concerns regarding a web site 
(http://barbarian.sitemynet.com/PitbuLs/id6.h tm -- now 
defunct) which gave addresses and telephone numbers for 
Armenian churches, hospitals, and foundations, along with 
advice for how to make bombs, when best to attack, and what 
dates are religious holidays.  The site clearly planned to 
provide similar information in the future for Jews, 
Suriyanis, and \"Ataturk Thought Associations,\" but had not 
yet gotten information for these. 
 
 
11. (C) Mesrob reported that Istanbul police had been very 
helpful in tracking and identifying the owner of the site, 
who was arrested and quickly sentenced to three years in 
prison.  Mesrob said that in the past, periodic small-scale 
attempts at attacking the Armenian Community had been largely 
unsuccessful, but pointed to a new security gate at the 
patriarchate as proof of continued vigilance.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL INVESTMENT CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTS FAMILIAR 
ISSUES 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
 
1. (U)  Summary:  The long-planned but oft-delayed 
International Investment Advisory Council (IAC) meeting 
grouping CEO\'s from leading multinationals finally took place 
in Istanbul on March 15.  Organized by the Turkish government 
with cooperation from the World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund, the council brought together key government 
economic policymakers and 19 business leaders, including 
executives from Citigroup, Fiat, Ford, Hyundai, Nestle, 
Siemens and Toyota.  In its final communique, the council 
praised the GOT for its progress towards macroeconomic 
stability, but reiterated the need for it to tackle a range 
of other long-standing problems that impede investment. 
Among the seven issues singled out were lingering 
administrative and bureaucratic hurdles to investment, 
failure to protect intellectual property rights,  Turkey\'s 
cumbersome tax code and inefficient legal system, and the 
need to rein in the country\'s unregistered economy. 
Attendees also pressed for creation of an Investment 
Promotion Agency and steps to encourage investment in 
research and development.  Prime Minister Erdogan, who 
attended the session, pledged that the GOT would tackle these 
issues and report back to the council in eight months.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Making a Splash: Originally scheduled for 2002, and 
subsequently postponed first to 2003 and ultimately to 2004, 
the council was intended to make a major splash by including 
top tier business leaders like Bill Gates of Microsoft. 
Organizers ultimately scaled back their expectations, but did 
secure participation by top executives from 19 leading 
multinationals, most of whom already have operations in 
Turkey.  A number of other companies expressed interest in 
attending, but at a lower level, and consequently were not 
invited because of the GOT\'s concern that only CEO-level 
executives participate.  (Note: World Bank officials told 
Emboffs last month that Bank President James Wolfensohn 
himself had sought to persuade the GOT of the utility of 
getting executives from the next tier, given their role in 
making investment decisions, but was unsuccessful.)  In the 
end attendees included the Presidents or CEO\'s of Citigroup, 
Hyundai, Lafarge, Metro AG, Nestle, Newmont Mining 
Corporation, Pirelli, Siemens, Toyota, Unilever.  The World 
Bank\'s Wolfensohn co-hosted the event, as did Belgian IMF 
Executive Director Willy Kiekens, who also represents Turkey. 
 (IMF Acting Managing Director Anne Krueger was to have 
represented the IMF following Managing Director Kohler\'s 
resignation, but ultimately neither she nor European 
Department Vice President Deppler was able to attend, leaving 
Kiekens to fill in, though he doesn\'t really speak for IMF 
management or staff.)  Representatives of Turkish NGO\'s 
including TUSIAD, the Turkish Exporters\' Assembly (TIM), the 
Union of Chambers (TOBB), and Foreign Investors\' Association 
(YASED) also participated.  From the Turkish government Prime 
Minister Erdogan attended the session, accompanied by his top 
economic aides. 
 
 
3. (U) Familiar Recommendations: If the level of attendance 
and attention garnered by the conference were new, the 
results were familiar.  While praising Turkey\'s progress 
towards economic and political stability over the last three 
years, council members also highlighted both a number of 
continuing impediments to investment and steps that need to 
be taken to attract investment.  Among them were: 
 
 
-- red tape and bureaucracy, particularly at the sectoral 
level. 
-- need for improvement in implementation of laws and dispute 
resolutions mechanisms. 
-- need for tax reform, to provide a corporate taxation 
regime which avoids double taxation and provides incentives 
for investment in R & D. 
-- need for improved infrastructure, particularly in 
telecommunications, power and transportation, and for further 
investment in education and training. 
-- the need to rein in Turkey\'s unregistered economy. 
-- lack of protection of intellectual property. 
-- creation of an investment promotion agency. 
 
 
Attendees also focused on issues particular to their sectors, 
such as the ongoing labor dispute that threatens to disrupt 
Pirelli\'s tire production here, and legislation that prevents 
companies like Metro A.G. from placing superstores in 
metropolitan areas. 
4. (U) Follow-on steps: Attendees agreed that the council 
will become an annual event, with an initial progress report 
to be delivered to participants in eight months.  Prime 
Minister Erdogan pledged the government will report back on 
implementation of the group\'s core recommendations at next 
year\'s meeting.  Economic Minister Babacan was named 
goverment liaison for the council, and it was agreed tht 
its work would also be pursued through the lon-standing 
Coordination Council for the Improvemet of the Investment 
Environment (YOIKK).  The later\'s technical committees, 
which bring together oth government and private sector 
representative, will serve as the working groups to develop 
cocrete measures to implement IAC recommendations. 
5. (SBU) Comment: Though primarily a public relatons 
exercise, the council meeting was undoubtedly useful in 
ensuring that GOT decisionmakers heard again at a high level 
the message that macroeconomic stability alone is not enough 
for Turkey to improve its dismal record in attracting 
investment-- progress on structural reforms is also 
essential.  Indeed, coming at a time when Turkey continues to 
struggle to attract foreign investment (having received only 
500-600 million USD in each of the last two years), and in 
the same week that the Economist Intelligence Unit 
(admittedly not a Turkey fan) rated the country 78th out of 
100 emerging and heavily indebted countries (on a par with 
Nigeria, and below the Ukraine and Azerbaijan), the meeting 
could not have been more timely.  The key will be 
implementation, however, and on that score the GOT\'s record 
is mixed at best.  YASED officials, who attended the meeting 
but were largely cut out of its preparation, have noted that 
the YOIKK committees have not met since November 2003, 
precisely because the government wanted to wait on the IAC 
meeting and its outcome before moving ahead.  Coming months 
will thus test the GOT\'s willingness to re-engage on these 
issues.  A number of our private sector contacts in Istanbul, 
noting the IMF\'s own difficulty in securing progress on 
structural reforms, are frankly sceptical that anything 
except harmonization as part of EU accession negotiations 
will move Turkey forward on many of these issues.  End

TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, TU, Istanbul 
SUBJECT: \"HONOR KILLING\" SHOCKS ISTANBUL, HIGHLIGHTS 
ONGOING WOMEN\'S RIGHTS ISSUES 
 
1. (u) Summary: The tragic murder of 22-year old Guldunya 
Toren on February 26 by two of her brothers at a Bakirkoy 
district hospital shocked Istanbul, captured several days of 
media coverage, and highlighted the fact that the tradition 
of \"honor killings\" remains deep-set, even in Turkey\'s most 
developed and cosmopolitan city.  Such incidents are only the 
most visible manifestation, however, of a pervasive attitude 
that denies women equal rights.  End Summary. 
 
 
Honor Killings 
-------------- 
2. (u) According to reports, Toren, originally from Bitlis in 
Southeast Turkey, was raped and impregnated by a family 
member last year.  Having \"dishonored\" her family, Toren fled 
to Istanbul, where she delivered the baby, but was eventually 
tracked down by two brothers, shot, and left to die on an 
Istanbul street.  She was then taken to the hospital where 
her brothers pursued her and killed her in front of 
witnesses.  The sensational details and timing of the case 
fueled widespread interest. 
 
 
3. (sbu) Human rights activists tell us that a few dozen such 
\"honor killings\" take place each year in Turkey.  Although 
Istanbul is the city with the largest number of reported 
cases in recent years, almost all of the individuals involved 
were immigrants from Turkey\'s Southeast.  Drawing on 13 years 
of experience and research in the Southeast, Vildan 
Yirmibesoglu, the Human Rights Department Head for the 
Istanbul Governor, told poloff that \"honor crimes\" are the 
result of a traditional culture that crosses all religious, 
ethnic, and tribal divisions in that region.  After 
immigrating to Turkey\'s large western cities, fellow 
villagers and townsmen tend to \"recreate\" their rural 
communities and to preserve their local traditions, including 
gender biases. 
 
 
Penal Code Reform 
----------------- 
4. (sbu) In order to address these and other gender 
discrimination issues, activists have made a considerable 
effort to press the government to enact vital legislative 
reform.  Liz Amado, a senior staff member of Istanbul-based 
Women for Women\'s Human Rights, explained that reforming the 
civil code was insufficient (note: this was accomplished in 
2001); entire sections of the penal code need to be rewritten 
to eliminate explicit and implicit language that 
discriminates against women.  According to Amado, these 
efforts suffered a serious setback with the election of the 
AKP government in November 2002.  Aysel Celikel, the interim 
Justice Minister before the elections, and a fellow traveler 
for women\'s rights activists, had accepted most of their 
proposals for the draft penal code, but the new AKP 
government decided to start from scratch (without consulting 
human rights groups).  Over a year later, Amado reports that 
constant lobbying with (reluctant) AKP deputies and (more 
supportive) CHP deputies has led the appropriate 
parliamentary commission to finally accept (most of) their 
proposed changes in the draft code that is still under review. 
 
 
5. (u) Assuming that the draft is passed in its current form, 
proposed changes will include: making sexual offenses crimes 
against \"persons\" and \"bodily integrity,\" instead of 
\"society\" and \"chastity\"; deligitimizing \"honor crimes\" by 
removing the \"unjust provocation\" article that allows for 
reduced sentences; deligitimizing marital rape; eliminating 
language that discriminates based on marital status and 
virginity; removing provisions for reduced sentences for 
rapists who marry their victims; and other reforms to protect 
children.  Additional proposed changes include: criminalizing 
forced virginity testing; decriminalizing \"indecent 
behavior\"; and making \"honor killings\" an \"aggravating\" 
circumstance that is subject to more severe sentences (as is 
currently the case with vendetta killings). 
 
 
Changing the Mindset of the System 
---------------------------------- 
6. (sbu) Amado said that the focus will soon shift to 
implementation.  Amado and Yirmibesoglu pointed to the 
attitudes of judges and prosecutors as a key element of the 
overall problem.  Yirmibesoglu remarked that in many cases 
these officials share the same outdated notions of \"honor\" as 
the perpetrators.  On an encouraging note, Canan Arin, a 
board member of the Istanbul Bar Association\'s Center for 
Women\'s Rights, pointed to decisions by prosecutors and 
judges in two \"honor killing\" trials last year in 
Kahramanmaras and Izmir to deny the application of the 
\"unjust provocation\" article (with its reduced sentence) 
based on the argument that the crimes were clearly 
premeditated.  Arin and Amado both expressed their hope that 
the Istanbul prosecutor and judge will approach the Toren 
case in the same manner.  Additionally, a Sanliurfa court 
just this week handed out the most severe punishment ever for 
an \"honor killing,\" giving life imprisonment to the 
perpetrator and 17-year prison terms to 6 other family 
members. 
 
 
7. (sbu) With regard to the Guldunya Toren case, Arin and 
Amado are both among a group that has filed cases charging 
the Istanbul police and the Bakirkoy hospital staff with 
negligence for failing to protect the victim.  They argued 
that even before the attacks, the police \"knew\" that the 
woman\'s life was in danger.  The Istanbul police chief has 
publicly denied responsibility, and even blamed Toren for 
refusing to name her attackers when she was admitted to the 
hospital.  Although warrants have been issued, the two 
brothers have not yet been apprehended. 
 
 
8. (u) The timing and gruesome details of the case have 
ensured widespread media attention.  The EU Troika 
subsequently drew further attention to the case by citing it 
as an example of ongoing human rights concerns.  Public 
officials and commentators used International Women\'s Day on 
March 8 to speak out on the case and women\'s rights in 
Turkey.  The Head of the Religious Affairs Directorate 
reinvigorated plans to have imams deliver sermons throughout 
Turkey to condemn the practice of honor killings as immoral 
and against Islam.  Amado noted ruefully, however, that 
neither the Prime Minister nor the President addressed the 
issue directly.  She claimed, moreover, that the Minister for 
Women\'s Affairs unhelpfully denied any relationship between 
the lack of women\'s shelters and honor killings. 
 
 
A Sign of Things to Come? 
------------------------- 
9. (sbu) Yirmibesoglu told poloff that the Istanbul Governor 
had been pushing the Religious Affairs Directorate for some 
time to speak out on this and other issues.  Meanwhile, she 
noted that the Governor has launched plans to open three new 
women\'s shelters in Istanbul this year (one was opened in 
February in the Fatih district, another will open in May). 
Additionally, Yirmibesoglu said that following the March 28 
local elections, the Governor plans to bring together 
officials, police, prosecutors, judges, and civil society 
activists for a meeting to discuss honor killings and other 
gender issues. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
10. (sbu) The continued practice of honor killings in 
Istanbul indicates that the cultural traditions of Turkey\'s 
Southeast remain deeply rooted among the immigrant 
communities here.  Antiquated notions of honor are reinforced 
by a more widespread societal bias that leads to pervasive 
gender discrimination.  The notable dearth of women 
candidates, for example, in the upcoming Istanbul March 28 
local elections contributes to a general impression that the 
advancement of women\'s rights has been slow.  Significant 
strides in the area of democratic reform and respect for 
human rights can not obscure the fact that overcoming gender 
prejudices and biases will take time.

SUBJECT: TERROR STRIKES ISTANBUL MASONIC LODGE 
 
REF: ISTANBUL 375 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: On March 9, a botched suicide attack 
against an Istanbul Masonic lodge left 2 dead and 7 wounded 
(reftel).  Investigations continue, but police statements and 
assorted press reports suggest that there may have been a 
network of planners and accomplices, as well as connections 
to a murder last year and possibly even to the November 
bombings of two Istanbul synagogues, the British Consulate 
and the HSBC building (Note: Istanbul police have not 
confirmed the latter).  Meetings with representatives of the 
Masons and Turkey\'s Jewish Community indicate a shared 
perception that \"Islamic\" terrorists have targeted their 
institutions.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Witnesses report that on March 9, 2 suicide bombers 
entered the Free Mason temple in Yakacik in the Kartal 
district of Istanbul, shot a security guard, and, while 
shouting Islamic slogans, opened fire on a Masonic lodge 
assembled for dinner.  Police report that 4 of 14 bombs 
strapped to the bombers then exploded, killing one bomber and 
a waiter, and injuring the other bomber and several Masons. 
The bomber who survived the attack is in stable condition in 
police custody.  The investigation has led to over a dozen 
arrests.  Police have linked one of the weapons used in the 
attack to the murder last year of a Jewish dentist.  One of 
the men arrested has since \"confessed\" to the murder. 
Istanbul police contacts told us that this suspect was also 
responsible for building the bombs used on March 9.  Some of 
those involved (including the dead bomber) reportedly 
received terrorist training in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
Another man arrested since the bombings (at the airport about 
to board a flight to Pakistan) was also wanted in connection 
with the November bombings (our police contacts could not 
confirm any direct connection, however, between this latest 
attack and those earlier bombings).  The Governor announced 
last week that, in the course of this investigation, police 
had uncovered and thwarted a plan to conduct another bombing 
(note: unconfirmed press reports suggest that the target was 
a television network, aTV, perhaps chosen because of its 
\"Jewish financing.\"  aTV is owned by Dinc Bilgin, who, 
according to our Jewish community contacts, may, in fact, be 
a \"secret\" Sabbatai Jew). 
 
 
Turkey\'s Long Masonic History 
----------------------------- 
3. (SBU) A senior local member of the Free Masons told poloff 
that the Masons have been active in Turkey for most of the 
last two hundred years.  With 13,000 active members and 
almost 200 lodges, there are Masons in almost every major 
Turkish city.  The largest concentration is in Istanbul where 
there are 108 lodges that operate out of three temples that 
also serve as community centers and gathering places (Note: 
\"lodges\" refer to groups of Masons who typically meet once 
every two weeks at one of the temples).  The recent attack 
took place at one of the three temples where one of the 
lodges was assembled for dinner. 
 
 
4. (SBU) During the Ottoman period, the Masons are believed 
to have supported the \"tanzimat\" (reformation) movement in 
the late 19th century and the \"Young Turk\" movement in the 
early 20th century.  Key \"Young Turks,\" including Talat Pasa, 
Enver Pasa, and Cemal Pasa, were all reportedly Masons 
themselves.  Additionally, many of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk\'s 
advisers may also have been Masons.  Our contact confirmed 
these rumors and argued that as a result of their support for 
these democratic and pro-Western reforms, Turkish Masons have 
been seen as \"enemies\" by \"fundamentalist Islamists.\"  This 
antipathy increased markedly over the last 30 years. 
Necmettin Erbakan and others close to him espoused 
anti-Masonic messages as they worked to develop successive 
Islamic political parties. 
 
 
5. (SBU) The secretive nature of the Turkish Masons (\"even 
more so than in the U.S., our contact noted) has generated an 
image problem for them in Turkey.  In 1999, the then-Grand 
Master launched a public campaign to address this problem 
(this included a public exhibit and television interviews, 
one of which was re-aired last week), but successive leaders 
have attached less importance to this issue.  In general, our 
contact believes that educated Turks are either \"pro-Mason\" 
or \"neutral,\" and that their principal problem is the 
\"anti-Islamic\" accusations that have poisoned their 
reputation with the more extreme Islamic elements of society. 
 
 
Zionists?  A Jewish Connection... 
--------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Forensic evidence linked one of the weapons used in 
the attack to the murder of a Jewish dentist in Istanbul last 
year.  One of the people subsequently arrested as a part of 
the ongoing police investigation \"confessed\" to the murder. 
Many Turks here are under the impression that Masons are 
\"pro-Zionist,\" a fact bolstered by the large number of 
conspiracy theory-style Turkish books on that subject. 
Jewish Community Vice President Lina Filiba confirmed the 
widespread nature of such impressions.  She told poloff the 
Masonic lodge bombing (and its link to the murder of a Jewish 
dentist) and last year\'s bombing of two Istanbul synagogues 
have underlined a pervasive fear in Turkey\'s Jewish Community 
that, after 50 years of largely avoiding tensions between 
Israel and Muslim populations, Turkey\'s Jews are now being 
directly targeted.  The fact that the terrorists, fed a 
steady diet of misinformation, confused the Masonic Lodge 
with a Jewish target is no comfort, Filiba added.  Now very 
concerned with the physical security of their gathering 
places, the Jewish Community leadership is struggling to take 
precautions and reduce their exposure to potential attacks. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Last year\'s bombings of the synagogues, the British 
Consulate, and the HSBC building were a wake-up call for the 
Masons as well.  Our Turkish Mason contact told us that the 
Masons received reports from the police of an anonymous 
caller \"threatening to attack more Masonic targets\" when he 
called to claim credit for the British bombings.  In response 
to this and other threats, the Istanbul police added security 
details to their sites, but our contact noted ironically that 
because the police worked from \"9 to 5,\" they were never in 
position to protect the Masonic temples during the busy 
evening periods.  Since the latest attacks, however, he 
admitted that police security has been provided around the 
clock. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Although the damage from this attack was limited, 
our contact was careful to note that news reports of 
\"incompetence\" on the part of \"amateur\" terrorists were 
incorrect.  His understanding of the attack (from the police 
and from witnesses) was that after shooting the private 
security guard, the terrorists entered the large garden 
courtyard and opened fire on the glass wall separating the 
courtyard from the restaurant.  Before they could reach the 
restaurant, however, one of the bombs detonated prematurely, 
killing one terrorist and incapacitating the other, before 
the remainder of the bombs could be manually detonated 
(presumably inside the building itself).  As a result, the 
damage was minimal and only those closest to the courtyard 
were injured. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
9. (SBU) Investigations into the attack continue, but early 
indications suggest that there was a network of planners and 
accomplices (some of whom may have trained in Pakistan and 
Afghanistan) and a connection with last year\'s murder of a 
Jewish dentist.  Whether there was a connection with last 
year\'s synagogue and British Consulate bombings remains to be 
seen.  In any case, the Jewish community and the Masons are 
convinced that there is a network of local extremists that 
remains committed to targeting their communities and anyone 
they deem to be working against the interests of Islam.

SIPDIS 
 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, TU, Istanbul 
SUBJECT: ISTANBUL MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS FOR DUMMIES 
 
 
1. (u) Summary: The Justice and Development Party (AKP) is 
poised for landslide victories in most of the March 28 
Istanbul municipal elections.  AKP candidate Kadir Topbas 
looks to be a shoo-in for the top prize -- Istanbul Mayor -- 
and AKP candidates are also expected to take the lion\'s share 
of the 32 district mayorships, city council seats, and other 
assorted local positions.  The Republican People\'s Party 
(CHP) will probably hold the wealthier districts of Sisli and 
Kadikoy, and may pick up similarly affluent Besiktas and 
Bakirkoy at the expense of the faltering Motherland Party 
(ANAP).  One or two other poorer districts where the 
conservative vote is hotly contested by AKP and Saadet Party 
may fall by default into the hands of CHP or another party. 
Rather than belabor the obvious AKP landslide, we offer 
instead a \"how to\"-guide for those interested in the nuts and 
bolts of the election process in Istanbul.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (u) Istanbul\'s streets are festooned with colorful 
banners, its buildings plastered with large candidate photos, 
the air filled by the shrill noise of loudspeakers.  The 
holiday-like atmosphere is for the upcoming March 28 local 
elections.  Here is our \"Istanbul Municipal Elections For 
Dummies\" -- a \"how-to\"-guide that will help you and your 
political party gain a local foothold in the Istanbul 
municipality (or help explain why your rivals succeeded where 
you failed). 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Organization, Organization, Organization 
---------------------------------------- 
3. (u) The cardinal rule and sine qua non for success in 
municipal elections in Istanbul is to build a strong 
\"teskilat,\" or party organization.  The standard structure 
consists of an executive committee with parallel women\'s and 
youth branches.  Each committee (and branch committee) has 
members assigned to head sub-committees for each of the key 
party functions, including election affairs, media, public 
relations, financial issues, local government, organizational 
affairs, economic issues, social issues, research, and 
foreign affairs.  This entire structure is duplicated at the 
district level in each of the 32 local districts and again at 
the \"mahalle\" or neighborhood level.  Finally, each 
neighborhood committee assigns a certain number of party 
volunteers to each specific polling station in their area. 
 
 
4. (u) The numbers add up quickly.  The AKP Kucukcekmece 
district organization, for example, includes 90 members on 
the executive, women\'s, and youth committees.  There are 
another 30 members on each of the 26 neighborhood executive, 
women\'s, and youth committees (actually 28 neighborhoods, 
since they have divided the two largest into two).  AKP has 
also assigned 2 party members to work each of the polling 
stations.  Kucukcekmece AKP Chairman Mevlut Uysal told us 
that he has over 4,000 AKP members working as volunteers in 
the district party organization.  We have seen similar 
numbers and structures for the major political parties in 
each district and neighborhood we have visited.  Based on our 
observations and conversations with AKP officials, we 
estimate that there are between 120,000 and 150,000 AKP 
members working as volunteers in Istanbul.  (Note: Smaller 
political parties are unable to maintain such organizations. 
Some cannot even identify candidates for each district, much 
less staff and volunteers in each neighborhood and polling 
station). 
 
 
-------------------------- 
Financing and Fund Raising 
-------------------------- 
5. (u) A strong party organization is also one of the keys to 
successful fund raising.  Both our AKP and CHP contacts in 
major districts have told us that their estimated campaign 
expenses are from USD 200,000 to 250,000 in cash, in addition 
to in-kind contributions from party members and supporters 
(i.e., vehicles, office space, volunteers).  Much of this 
money comes from party members.  Dues are minimal (about USD 
4 annually for AKP), but ambitious party members are expected 
to make contributions in other ways.  One party member told 
us, for example, that he was told to \"sell\" 5 tickets to a 
fund raising dinner for about USD 40 each (he bought them 
himself).  Candidate applications are another major source of 
funding.  Applications for district mayor cost around USD 
4,000.  With as many as a dozen or more applications in some 
of their safer districts, AKP in particular was able to rely 
on these fees as a significant source of funding.  Fund 
raising dinners and receptions are an additional source of 
financing.  Cash contributions to political parties are 
limited by Turkish law to USD 40, but we suspect that most 
parties find ways around this regulation. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
(National) Success Breeds (Local) Success 
----------------------------------------- 
6. (u) Although the importance of individual candidates is a 
mantra that is frequently used to distinguish municipal 
elections from national elections, party affiliation remains 
a major factor in local electoral contests.  Turkey\'s 
government is highly-centralized with regard to most public 
administration functions (note: the parliament is currently 
discussing an AKP proposal to decentralize public 
administration). There is a widespread perception that having 
municipal officials from the parties in power nationally will 
lead to more funding and attention from Ankara.  Such 
candidates often try to use this perception to their 
advantage.  The AKP candidate for Kadikoy district mayor and 
his campaign manager freely admitted as much to poloff (note: 
the incumbent Kadikoy mayor is from CHP).  Countless voters 
have also told us that this is a major (and sometimes 
determining) factor in their decisions. 
----------------------- 
Touch All of Your Bases 
----------------------- 
7. (u) As is the case in any democratic country, there are 
certain individuals and organizations in Istanbul that 
exercise influence in the political process.  Successful 
politicians are careful to touch all of their bases to 
maximize their chances of appealing to the widest possible 
electorate.  In Istanbul these include: news and media 
organizations, labor and teachers\' unions, assorted business 
associations, clubs (including Lion\'s and Rotary chapters) 
and, perhaps most interestingly, the myriad of \"hemsehir,\" or 
fellow townsmen associations.  Politicians are expected to 
\"call on\" these organizations to introduce themselves, 
explain their plans, and ask for support. 
 
 
8. (u) The vast majority of Istanbul\'s population arrived in 
the last 30 years.  Most Istanbul residents continue to 
identify themselves with their hometowns, and even more 
narrowly with their home villages or districts.  Istanbul is 
home to over a million people from the Anatolian town of 
Sivas alone, with large numbers from the Black Sea, the 
Southeast, and rural Anatolia.  Istanbul has thousands of 
\"fellow townsmen\" cultural associations organized along these 
lines.  These associations serve primarily as community 
centers that host cultural activities and provide limited 
assistance to newly-arrived immigrants and to their home 
towns.  From a political perspective, however, their 
importance goes beyond their organizational capacity.  The 
bonds of kinship between fellow townsmen can often be a 
determining factor in voting patterns and behavior.  Politics 
in the Zeytinburnu district of Istanbul, for example, is 
dominated by its large concentration of residents from 
Giresun.  All of the successful parties take these 
considerations into account when choosing their candidates 
for municipal elections. 
 
 
-------------- 
Hit the Street 
-------------- 
9. (u) The active portion of the campaign period for Istanbul 
municipal elections is fairly short.  Most of the political 
parties postponed their official announcement of candidates 
until the legal deadline one month before the elections. 
Although some campaigning began earlier, most of the 
advertising and activities has been confined to the last few 
weeks.  The emphasis seems to be on roving campaign vehicles 
(replete with larger-than life photos of the candidates and 
sub-standard loud-speaker systems), outdoor billboard 
advertisements and banners, and newspaper advertisements and 
supplements.  Advertising on television and radio is banned. 
Campaign volunteers will often insert newspaper supplements 
about their candidates and hand out free copies of the 
newspapers.  Successful candidates spend much of their time 
touching the bases mentioned above and meeting with 
shopkeepers and visiting constituents in their districts. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
10. (u) Despite the size of the Istanbul metropolitan area, 
local politics retains a town, even village-style flavor. 
The reputation of local candidates depends heavily on their 
family name, who they know, and where they are from.  AKP\'s 
likely success in the March 28 elections here in Istanbul 
stems in large part from its strong organizational base and 
its proximity and responsiveness to local voters.  As the 
first single-party government in decades, however, these 
elections are also viewed as a referendum on AKP\'s 
performance since November 2002.  We expect Istanbul voters 
to give AKP a ringing endorsement with about 50 percent of 
the total vote, the Istanbul mayorship, 23 or 24 of the 32 
district mayorships, and 75 percent or more of the city 
council seats.

2. (U) Most of Turkey\'s Jews are descendants of the original 
Sephardim, who were evicted from Spain by Ferdinand and 
Isabella in 1492.  Offered refuge by the Ottoman emperors, 
they have lived in Istanbul and parts of western Turkey for 
500 years.  A small group of Ashkenazi (European) Jews also 
sought refuge in Turkey during the Second World War, and have 
remained.  Since the founding of the State of Israel, Turkish 
Jews have generally felt more secure and been more prosperous 
than other Jewish communities in the Muslim world.  Today, 
Turkey\'s 20,000 Jews represent the last vibrant Jewish 
community in a Muslim-majority country. 
 
 
3. (U) Another, less well-known offshoot of the Jewish 
population in Turkey are the Sabbateans, (or \"Donme\"), the 
followers of a 17th century Jewish cleric, Sabbatai Sevi, who 
lived in Izmir (and later Thessaloniki) and claimed to be the 
messiah.  Confronted with the option of converting to Islam 
or dying, Sevi became a Muslim.  Many of his followers did so 
as well, while secretly maintaining their Jewish observances. 
 No accurate statistics exist regarding the size of the 
Sabbatean community, or how many of those still adhere to 
Jewish traditions, though they may number in the thousands. 
 
 
4. (C) Jewish history in Turkey occasionally provides fuel 
for the paranoid fantasies of extremely nationalistic 
Islamists.  Among the facts occasionally cited as \"proof\" of 
Jewish interference in Turkish political life are: Ataturk\'s 
birth in Thessaloniki (a heavily-Jewish city at the time), 
and attendance at a school run by Sabbateans; Masonic 
(believed to be a Jewish/Zionist organization by many Turks) 
membership of many leaders of the Young Turks and early 
Republic; the relative affluence and better education of 
Turkey\'s Jewish community; and the widely-accepted rumor that 
former Foreign Minister Ismail Cem was descended from 
Sabbateans. 
 
 
Recent Attacks 
-------------- 
 
 
5. (C) On August 22, 2003, a 39-year-old Jewish dentist, 
Yasef Yahya, was killed in his office in Sisli, in central 
European Istanbul (ref A).  Yahya was a member of the board 
of directors of a Jewish retirement home, a member of B\'nai 
Brith, and a regular attendee at the Haskoy synagogue. 
According to press reports, Yahya was killed \"execution 
style,\" with a single bullet to the head.  Police report that 
Yahya was found with a woman\'s stocking stuffed in his mouth, 
and his briefcase and cell phone were missing.  However, 
Yahya\'s wallet, containing TL 43 million (USD 31), and his 
watch were still on the body. 
 
 
6. (C) On November 15, 2003, two truck bombs were 
simultaneously detonated in front of synagogues in Istanbul, 
killing 23 and wounding over 300 people (refs B and C).  Each 
attack was carried out by suicide bombers using small trucks 
with fake license plates carrying 300-400 kilograms of 
explosives. 
 
 
7. (C) On March 9, 2004, two suicide bombers entered the Free 
Mason temple in Yakacik in the Kartal district of Istanbul, 
shot a security guard, and, while shouting Islamic slogans, 
opened fire on a Masonic lodge assembled for dinner (ref D). 
Police report that 4 of 14 bombs strapped to the bombers then 
exploded, killing one bomber and a waiter, and injuring the 
other bomber and several Masons.  The investigation has led 
to over a dozen arrests.  Police have linked one of the 
weapons used in the attack to the murder of Yasef Yahya.  One 
of the men arrested has reportedly confessed to Yahya\'s 
murder. 
 
 
Jewish Community Reaction 
------------------------- 
8. (C) Poloffs spoke with Jewish merchants, lawyers, 
academics, and Lay Council members about the changed security 
environment confronting the community, all of whom concurred 
that the events of the past year have deeply shaken the 
community.  Synagogue attendance is down significantly, and 
the community leadership now organizes services at only two 
of the four commonly-used synagogues.  Security at the 
synagogues has been increased, and police are providing more 
officers before, during, and after services.  Youth and 
cultural centers (which were in unsecured rented space) have 
been closed.  The Swissotel has offered assistance, and youth 
activities now take place in the hotel\'s ballroom when it is 
not otherwise occupied.  Jewish families have stopped letting 
youth volunteer as synagogue security.  Two families have 
removed their children from the Jewish school, fearing it may 
be a future target.  Lay Council VP Lina Filiba recently 
returned from a fund-raising tour in the United States, 
soliciting Jewish communities there to help pay for necessary 
school upgrades to Jewish schools, synagogues, and other 
properties. 
 
 
9. (C) All contacts spoke of the linkage between the murder 
of Yasef Yahya and the attack on the Masonic Lodge as a 
source of fear.  One interlocutor, Prof. Rifat Bali, said 
that he believed the knowledge that Yahya was killed by 
terrorists willing to carry out larger operations simply for 
being Jewish was even more frightening to the community than 
the synagogue bombings.  Individual assassinations, he said, 
were more fearsome than larger-scale attacks. 
 
 
10. (C) Still, none of post\'s contacts reported any knowledge 
of Jewish community members planning to leave Turkey.  One 
on-line Turkish-Jewish discussion group laid out options in 
case of a substantially worse situation, and discussed 
relatives in the U.S., Israel, and Europe who might help them 
emigrate, but at this time no one appeared to be doing so. 
Jewish shop-owners with whom poloffs spoke said they too had 
discussed various options outside Turkey with their families, 
but had no plans to leave, because their families and 
businesses were in Istanbul. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
11. (C) Conspiracy-theory fueled fantasies have convinced 
some radical Islamists that Zionists and Masons are behind 
all the woes of the world\'s Muslims.  This paranoia is not 
exclusive to Turkey.  Now, however, radical groups in 
Istanbul are acting upon these fantasies, and making the 
city, like much of the Middle East, a hard place of residence 
for Jews.

SUBJECT: TURKS PROTEST YASSIN\'S DEATH, CONDEMN ISRAEL, U.S. 
 
1. (u) Summary: Protesters burned Israeli and American flags 
at a symbolic funeral held for the former Hamas leader 
Sheikh Ahmad Yassin following the noon prayer on Friday, 
March 26, in the Sultanahmet district, in central Istanbul. 
About 5,000 people participated in the demonstration 
organized by the Palestine\'s Friends Initiative, a group 
that includes some of Turkey\'s major Islamic NGOs. End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (u) Following the Friday noon prayer on March 26, a large 
group of about 5,000 people gathered in Sultanahmet Square 
to protest the death of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  The 
demonstration was planned by the Palestinan Friend\'s 
Initiative, a movement which includes some of Turkey\'s major 
Islamic NGOs, including Mazlum-Der, Ozgur-Der, Insan Vakfi, 
and the Association of Jurists. 
 
 
3. (u) The organizers galvanized the crowd by hanging a 
Sheikh Yassin poster from one of the mosque\'s windows, 
distributing Palestanian flags, and shouting slogans, 
including \"Sheikh Yassin, your way is our way,\" \"Down with 
Israel,\" \"Down with American Imperialism,\" and \"Hail to 
Hamas, go on resisting.\" The mood of the crowd reached a 
frenzy when an effigy of Israeli PM Ariel Sharon and Israeli 
and American flags were set on fire.  The demonstration was 
concluded with a funeral prayer for Yassin and speeches 
criticizing Israel and the US. 
 
 
4. (u) The protest was held under the watchful eyes of a 
large riot squad from the Turkish National Police.  The 
organizers were careful to warn the crowd to disperse 
peacefully and at no point did the police intervene. 
 
 
5. (u) Comment: Islamists in Istanbul were quick to condemn 
Israel\'s actions, with many echoing Saadet Party leader 
Recai Kutan\'s remarks, \"We once again see that the biggest 
terrorists are Israel and the US.\"  This outrage was shared, 
to a certain extent, by many Istanbul residents across the 
political spectrum.  Even Prime Minister Erdogan, perhaps 
motivated in part by the March 28 municipal elections, 
described Yassin\'s death as a \"terrorist action.\"

SUBJECT: GREATER MIDDLE EAST INITIATIVE:  YOUNG 
TURKISH FOREIGN-POLICY ACADEMICS SKEPTICAL NOT OF 
U.S. MOTIVES BUT OF SUCCESS 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR EDELMAN\'S MEETING 
WITH A GROUP OF ISTANBUL ACADEMICS PROVIDED AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO GAUGE REACTIONS OF INFORMED 
INTERLOCUTORS TO THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST 
INITIATIVE.  SEVERAL WARNED OF UNINTENDED 
CONSEQUENCES, AND OTHERS WONDERED IF THE PROPOSED 
COMMITMENT COULD BE SUSTAINED.  NOTABLE FOR THEIR 
ABSENCE WERE EXPRESSIONS OF MORAL INDIGNATION 
ABOUT THE ARAB/ISRAELI PROBLEM AND SUSPICIONS OF 
U.S. MOTIVES IN WANTING TO TRANSFORM THE GREATER 
MIDDLE EAST.  \"GOOD LUCK!\" THEY SAID, IN EFFECT. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (SBU) AT A FEBRUARY 27 BREAKFAST HOSTED BY THE 
CONSUL GENERAL, SIX RISING STARS OF TURKISH 
UNIVERSITY FOREIGN-POLICY/INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS 
FACULTIES MET WITH AMBASSADOR EDELMAN, WHO 
SKETCHED OUT FOR THEM THE GENESIS OF THE GREATER 
MIDDLE EAST INTIATIVE AND INVITED THEIR REACTIONS. 
 
 
3. (SBU) HAKAN YILMAZ (BOGAZICI UNIVERSITY; PH.D 
IN POLITICAL SCIENCE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, 1996) 
RECALLED THE ANNULMENT OF ALGERIA\'S ELECTIONS AND 
THE SUBSEQUENT BLOODSHED IN ASKING THE RHETORICAL 
QUESTION: \"IF YOU DON\'T KNOW WHAT\'S IN THE BOX, DO 
YOU WANT TO OPEN IT?\"  THERE IS NO RELIABLE 
OPINION POLLING IN THE ARAB WORLD, HE SAID.  THE 
RESULTS OF ELECTIONS MIGHT NOT BE TO THE U.S.\'S 
LIKING.  THAT SAID, IT IS MORALLY A GOOD THING TO 
TRY TO BRING DEMOCRACY TO THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST. 
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE IN THE WEST (NOTE: HE 
INCLUDED TURKEY.  END NOTE.) HAVE THE WILL, THE 
MONEY, AND THE STAYING POWER FOR THE \"SOCIAL 
ENGINEERING\" THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED.  AN OSCE-TYPE 
ORGANIZATION FOR THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST MIGHT 
HELP, BUT EXPERIENCE IS NOT ENCOURAGING; NOTHING 
HAS COME OF SIMILAR EFFORTS BEFORE, BE THEY IN SUB- 
SAHARAN AFRICA OR THE ARAB WORLD ITSELF. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) GUL SOSAY (BOGAZICI UNIVERSIY; PH.D. IN 
POLITICAL SCIENCE, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, 1999) 
COMMENTED THAT \"DEMOCRACY\" - I.E. A SYSTEM FOR 
ELECTING OFFICEHOLDERS - IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO 
TRANSFORM THE GME COUNTRIES INTO HAPPIER PLACES. 
THEY NEED JOBS, EDUCATION, AND INFRASTRUCTURE. 
HOW IS THE U.S. GOING TO IMPLANT DEMOCRATIC 
VALUES/SYSTEMS IN SOCIETIES BEREFT OF THEM? 
EVIDENTLY, IRAQIS COULD NOT BE MADE TO APPRECIATE 
THE VALUE OF \"CAUCUSES.\"  ONE CAN PRAISE AND 
PROMOTE GRASS-ROOTS INSTITUTIONS AND NGO\'S, BUT 
HOW DOES ONE FOSTER THEM AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE 
CONDITIONED BY DECADES, IF NOT CENTURIES, OF 
LOOKING ONLY TO THE STATE FOR SOLUTIONS?  IF THE 
U.S. IS SERIOUS ABOUT BRINGING LITERACY, ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT, GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETC. TO THE REGION, 
WHAT ROLE IN THAT EFFORT DOES IT ENVISION FOR THE 
UNITED NATIONS? 
 
 
5. (SBU) UMUT OZKIRIMLI (ISTANBUL BILGI 
UNIVERSITY;  PH.D IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, 
ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY, 1998) ASKED HOW THE GREATER 
MIDDLE EAST INITIATIVE WOULD TAKE ACCOUNT OF 
LATENT AND WIDESPREAD ANTI-AMERICANISM, ESPECIALLY 
IF DEMOCRATIC REFORMS BRING ANTI-AMERICAN ELEMENTS 
TO POWER?  HAS THE U.S. WEIGHED THE CHANCES OF 
SUCH AN OUTCOME?  WHY WILL THE U.S.\'S CLAIM TO BE 
HELPING THESE COUNTRIES BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE, 
RATHER THAN VIEWED WITH SUSPICION?  SOME EUROPEAN 
INTELLECTUALS NOW EVEN TALK OF \"DEMOCRATIC 
COLONIALISM.\" 
 
 
6. (SBU) AHMET HAN (ISTANBUL BILGI UNIVERSITY; 
PH.D, ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY, 2001) EXPRESSED CONCERN 
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST 
INITIATIVE TO UNLEASH IRREDENTISM. IF YOU BRING 
DEMOCRACY, YOU WILL INVITE PEOPLE TO QUESTION 
THEIR COMMITMENT TO CURRENT BORDERS OF NATION- 
STATES; HE SPECIFICALLY CITED JORDAN AND KUWAIT. 
HE ALSO OPINED THAT AMERICANS\' PSYCHOLOGY 
TRADITIONALLY UNDERESTIMATES THE SALIENCE OF 
HISTORICAL GRIEVANCES.  HE ILLUSTRATED HIS POINT 
WITH AN ANALOGY: GIVE A SURPRISE \"INFUSION\" OF 
$100 TO A COUPLE OF AMERICANS; TO THE AMERICANS, 
ALMOST ANY DIVISION OF IT WILL BE CONSIDERED 
ACCEPTABLE, BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES WILL BE GETTING A 
NET BENEFIT.  IN THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST, HOWEVER, 
RECIPIENTS WILL PRIMARILY CONSIDER THEIR FEELINGS 
ABOUT THE OTHER RECIPIENT IN DECIDING WHAT IS FAIR 
AND THUS ACCEPTABLE. 
 
 
7. (SBU) BULENT ARAS (FATIH UNIVERSITY; PH.D, 
BOGAZICI UNIVERSITY, 1998) ALSO SPOKE OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF BORDER DISPUTES ERUPTING AS A 
CONSEQUENCE OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE GREATER 
MIDDLE EAST.  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE 
THINK, DON\'T BE OBSESSED WITH POLLS; GO TO THE 
MOSQUES.  (NOTE: FATIH IS AN ISLAMIST-ORIENTED 
UNIVERSITY.  END NOTE.)  IT IS HARD TO APPEAR 
CONSISTENT, AND THEREBY AVOID THE ACCUSATION OF 
DOUBLE STANDARDS, WHEN CHOOSING BETWEEN SECURITY 
AND DEMOCRACY.  IF YOU REALLY WANT SECURITY, YOU 
WILL ULTIMATELY LET KARIMOV DO WHAT HE WANTS IN 
UZBEKISTAN.  IF YOU REALLY WANT DEMOCRACY, YOU 
WILL SUPPORT DISSIDENTS ONLY TO FIND THAT THEIR 
EFFECTIVENESS DIMINISHES IN PROPORTION TO THEIR 
IDENTIFICATION WITH THE U.S.  \"YOU SHOULD HAVE 
LEFT SAAD EDDIN IBRAHIM IN JAIL A LITTLE WHILE 
LONGER,\" HE QUIPPED, REFERRING TO THE CASE OF THE 
EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN SCHOLAR. 
 
 
8. (SBU) IN RESPONDING TO THESE AND OTHER 
OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE TURKISH ACADEMICS, THE 
AMBASSADOR HIGHLIGHTED SEVERAL THEMES.  FOR A 
VARIETY OF REASONS, GME COUNTRIES WERE FOR A LONG 
TIME NOT HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS OF DEMOCRACY 
AND GOOD GOVERNANCE.  THIS HAS NOW CHANGED.  IN 
THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST, WE ALL DIAGNOSE THE SAME 
PROBLEMS; TO DO NOTHING ABOUT THEM IS NOT AN 
OPTION.  AMERICANS ARE NOT GOING TO BE DISSUADED 
BY THE \"PROBLEMATIC\" NATURE OF THE INITIATIVE.  WE 
ARE NOT ATTEMPTING TO IMPOSE ANYTHING ON THE 
REGION. THERE IS NO DETAILED BLUEPRINT FOR THE 
INITIATIVE.  RATHER, THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO 
FINDING WAYS AND MEANS TO HELP WHERE WE CAN BY 
CREATING AN INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE 
TO, AND SUPPORTIVE OF, CHANGE EMANATING FROM THE 
REGION.  IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO ADAPT 
EXISTING INSTRUMENTS TO SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC REFORM 
AND DEVELOP NEW ONES. THE AMBASSADOR RECOUNTED AN 
ANECDOTE FROM AN ARAB AMBASSADOR IN ANKARA, WHO 
WAS LISTENING TO A HARANGUE ABOUT U.S. MEDDLING IN 
THE REGION WHEN HE INTERRUPTED TO ASK: ARE WE 
HAPPY WITH THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN OUR COUNTRIES, 
WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS, OUR ECONOMIES, OUR 
HEALTH-CARE SYSTEMS?  IF SOMEBODY IS OFFERING TO 
HELP US, SHOULDN\'T WE BE GRATEFUL FOR THE OFFER? 
 
 
9.  (SBU) COMMENT: A HESITANT, QUIZZICAL AND 
SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL REACTION BY TURKISH ACADEMICS 
TO THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST INITIATIVE IS TO BE 
EXPECTED.  IT IS PARALLELED IN THE TURKISH MEDIA. 
THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE THE GME INITIATIVE HAS NOT 
YET BEEN DEFINED IN DETAIL.  WE SAW SOMETHING 
SIMILAR AT AN EARLIER MEETING BETWEEN THE 
AMBASSADOR AND ELEVEN REPRESENTATIVES FROM 
PROMINENT ISTANBUL-BASED NGOS.  AFTER THE 
AMBASSADOR HAD EXPLAINED THE ADMINISTRATION\'S 
THINKING BEHIND THE GME INITIATIVE, HE WAS MET BY 
AN INITIAL SILENCE THAT SEEMED TO UNDERSCORE THE 
REPRESENTATIVES\' HESITATION TO ENGAGE ON THE 
TOPIC.  HOWEVER, THEY SOON WARMED UP TO IT.  WHAT 
IS WORTH NOTING IS THAT AMONG TURKISH FOREIGN 
POLICY THINKERS THE GME INITIATIVE IS NOT 
REFLEXIVELY VIEWED IN KNEE-JERK FASHION AS SOME 
KIND OF PLOY DESIGNED TO SIDETRACK THE ARAB- 
ISRAELI DISPUTE OR INFILTRATE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. 
THE FOCUS IS ON SECURING TURKEY\'S INTERESTS - NOT 
THE INTERESTS OF ARABS OR THE INTERESTS OF 
FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIMS. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: TURKISH POLICE SEIZE 4.4 TONS OF MORPHINE BASE 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David L. Arnett for reasons 1.4 (b) and ( 
 
 
d). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Turkish National Police (TNP) seized 4.4 tons 
of morphine base, with an estimated value in Turkey of USD 
15.5 million, in a raid on an Istanbul warehouse on March 29. 
 The group targeted in the recent raid has connections to 
other narcotics trafficking groups in Turkey and elsewhere. 
TNP continue to investigate, and may yet succeed in further 
dismantling this network.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) In early 2004, the Turkish National Police (TNP) 
received information indicating the possible presence of a 
multi-ton quantity of morphine base being stored in Istanbul. 
 Acting on intelligence, TNP officers raided a warehouse in 
an industrial park located in Istanbul on March 29.  Inside 
the warehouse was a truck which contained 4.4 tons of 
morphine base.  The morphine was produced in Afghanistan 
during the period of Taliban rule, and may have been 
trafficked to Turkey through Iran.  The intended wholesale 
point of sale was most likely Western Europe.  The 
unprocessed morphine base has a value in Turkey of 
approximately USD 15.5 million.  If processed, the morphine 
has a wholesale value of USD 50-60 million. 
 
 
3. (C) Prior to the raid, TNP had set up long-term 
surveillance of the group operating the warehouse, with the 
goal of determining how many people were connected to the 
trafficked morphine.  Five Turkish nationals were arrested as 
a result.  All five are native-born residents of Istanbul, 
with three from the same family. 
 
 
4. (C) Information on the raid was released to the press on 
March 31.  Press have reported a linkage between this 
trafficking group and Cetinkaya, who was previously linked in 
the press to numerous large heroin seizures.  Post assesses 
that this linkage seems accurate. 
 
 
5. (C) DEA Istanbul reports that in subsequent conversation 
with TNP officials, the TNP have indicated that they are now 
targeting organizations, and not just trying to seize illicit 
drugs.  TNP has indicated that they are now placing greater 
resources into follow-up on successful operations, seeking to 
identify the larger network facilitating drug trafficking. 
 
 
6. (C) COMMENT: This latest seizure, coupled with that of 
over a ton of heroin earlier this year, illustrates the 
initial success of the TNP\'s new strategy.  Officials 
realize, however, that these early successes have just begun 
to scratch the suface of this city\'s and country\'s 
trafficking problem.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: TRUCKING INTO THE EU...VIA CYPRUS? 
 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  Hundreds of Turkish truckers were stopped 
for days at several EU border crossings on May 1 when 
European customs officials insisted that they present 
insurance cards valid in Cyprus.  Although the crisis was 
resolved by issuing replacement insurance cards, Turkish 
truckers and border officials were piqued that the 
requirement was instituted without notification, particularly 
given the unlikelihood of any Turkish truck actually ever 
driving to Cyprus.  End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (U)  Turkish truckers were stopped on May 1 at the 
Ipsala/Kipi border crossing by Greek customs officials 
demanding \"green cards\" (proof of third party insurance) 
showing Cyprus as one of the 43 Green Card 
System-participating countries.  (Note:  Prior to May 1, 
green cards purchased in Turkey showed the Cyprus box on the 
card marked out with two \"X\"\'s.  End note.)  Huseyin Turan 
Yanik, the regional representative for a Turkish transport 
association (Uluslararisi Nakliyeciler Dernegi - UND), told 
poloff May 7 that this problem was solved relatively quickly. 
 Some truckers were able to purchase new single-entry green 
cards at the border for 100 to 300 Euros, while others got 
them through agents in Istanbul.  Turkish truckers who were 
stopped in other European countries -- including Hungary, 
Slovakia and Croatia -- were also able to arrange for new 
green cards on-site at similar expense.  Yanik, who 
personally fielded many of the calls from panicked truckers, 
estimates that between 400 and 1000 trucks were affected at 
the Ipsala border crossing alone.  Although the backlog had 
largely cleared by May 4, the full costs associated with 
these delays - which the UND fears may include penalties for 
late deliveries and/or contract cancellations - will not be 
known until all the trucks return from their destinations in 
Europe. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Nevzat Er, Chief Customs Inspector General for 
Kapikule and Ipsala told Poloff on May 7 that it was unclear 
whether or not EU countries were coordinating on this new 
requirement.  He claimed that Brussels had not sent out any 
new directive about this, and said his Greek counterparts got 
their orders by telephone from Athens.  Yanik and Er both 
questioned the logic of the new requirement since the chance 
of a Turkish truck transiting Cyprus is quite low, but Yanik 
was mostly pragmatic.  The majority of his members didn\'t 
care whether or not Cyprus was \"X-ed out\" or not, he said; 
\"they just want to do their job.\"  Despite his 
business-oriented attitude, it was clear that many at the 
border suspected Greece was behind the new green card 
requirement, and that politics was getting in the way of 
commerce.  Yanik expects that a similar situation could 
develop with other customs documents, such as ATR 
certificates, in the future.

     C. C) ANKARA 1752 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
 
1. (sbu) Summary: Following a decision by Archbishop 
Christodoulos of Greece to appoint three new bishops without 
his approval, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and an 
enlarged Holy Synod formally broke communion with 
Christodoulos on April 30 and called on the newly-appointed 
bishops not to assume their positions.  It remains to be seen 
whether this latest salvo will lead to a resolution of the 
conflict or a permanent split within the Greek Orthodox 
Church.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (u) Ignoring a warning from Bartholomew, Archbishop 
Christodoulos of Greece led the Greek Holy Synod in electing 
3 new bishops on April 26.  As reported ref A, the dioceses 
in question are among the 36 \"New Land\" dioceses that belong 
to the Ecumenical Patriarchate but are \"administered\" by the 
Greek Orthodox Church under the authority of the 1928 
Patriarchal and Synodical Act.  In response, an enlarged 
meeting of the Major Holy and Sacred Resident Synod, 
including 41 bishops from Turkey and throughout the Greek 
Orthodox diaspora (including Archbishop Demetrios of 
America), convened in Istanbul and voted unanimously on April 
30 to break \"communion\" with Christodoulos, declare the 
elections invalid, and enjoin the \"elected\" bishops not to 
assume their provinces (otherwise communion would be broken 
with them as well). 
 
 
3. (c) While the decision appears to be strictly canonical 
(\"A Bishop should not venture to effect ordinations outside 
of his bounds\"), the severity of the measure has sparked 
controversy among the Greek Orthodox community.  Patriarchate 
officials justify the decision by citing a pattern of willful 
disobedience on the part of Christodoulos since he was 
elected in 1998.  As stated in the April 30 Protocol, 
\"...Christodoulos... repeatedly and frequently did willfully 
transgress... by seeking to be mentioned as Primate... by 
failing to observe (the Patriarchal and Synodical Act of 
1928)... he persists in disorder, and harms himself and the 
pleroma of the Church, becoming thus the cause of scandal and 
division...\"  According to the Secretary of the Holy Synod 
Metropolitan Meliton, there is little love lost between 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and Christodoulos. 
Bartholomew himself told poloff that they rarely speak and 
that it had been almost a year since they had last done so. 
 
 
4. (c) A Patriarchal delegation traveled to Greece in early 
May to meet with the President, Prime Minister, Foreign 
Minister and senior parliamentarians to present their case. 
Metropolitan Meliton, who participated in the delegation, 
told poloff that their interlocutors were polite, but 
declined to get involved in the dispute.  Meliton noted that 
he believes the new government is more sympathetic to 
Christodoulos than the previous PASOK government.  Although 
there are only a few weeks remaining before the new bishops 
must legally assume their provinces, Meliton was hopeful that 
Christodolous would back down and defuse the crisis.  Asked 
what further steps might be taken against him, Meliton said 
that he could be declared \"schismatic\" and excommunicated 
from the Church. 
 
 
5. (c) Comment: Although the decision of the Patriarch and 
the Holy Synod would seem to contradict the uninformed but 
widely-held notion in Turkey that the \"Greek Patriarch\" is 
merely a stooge of Greece, the event passed with only limited 
news coverage and little notice in Istanbul.  The 
participation of the diaspora, including the 6 new foreign 
members of the Holy Synod, may raise eyebrows in Ankara, 
however, as the Turkish government continues to ponder 
whether and how to respond to the inclusion of foreigners in 
the Synod (refs B and C).  Finally, it is worth noting that 
Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II, the Ecumenical 
Patriarch\'s most serious rival for authority within the 
Orthodox world, did not miss this opportunity to score points 
against Bartholomew by sending a public letter of support to

1. (c) Summary: Until now Istanbul-based initiatives have had 
an important role to play in track-two moves to improve 
Turco-Armenian relations.  However, the Turkish Armenian 
Reconciliation Commission (TARC), much-derided by the 
Armenian diaspora and largely ignored by Turks, has 
discontinued its active work and appears to be reinventing 
itself as a more passive bilateral forum.  Separately, a 
Vienna-based initiative to bring together Turkish and 
Armenian historians has attracted little attention in 
Istanbul and will have trouble finding common ground between 
its participants.  Citing an unfavorable political climate 
and bilateral tensions, the Armenian Patriarch has asked the 
Armenian Catholicos to delay a planned visit to Turkey until 
2006.  End Summary. 
 
 
The TARC is Dead, Long Live the TARC 
------------------------------------ 
2. (c) At an April Moscow meeting, the TARC decided to 
declare victory and \"discontinue\" its work.  Former Turkish 
Foreign Minister Ilter Turkmen and former Bilgi University 
Rector Ilter Turan, two of the Turkish participants, both 
told Istanbul poloff that the TARC had largely succeeded in 
its limited objectives, namely, to develop a rapport and an 
atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence between key 
unofficial Turks and Armenians.  In Moscow, they endorsed the 
recommendations of coordinators David Philips and Joe 
Montville to take the logical next step and use this core 
group of individuals in a reconstituted Consultative Group to 
support and promote worthwhile track-two initiatives.  The 
new group will meet less frequently (perhaps annually), but 
will include a wider range of businessmen, academics, and NGO 
figures. 
 
 
3. (c) At the same time, the TARC members undertook to 
approach their respective governments  to offer advice on how 
to advance reconciliation efforts.  Both Turkmen and Turan 
said that the recommendations would include an opening of the 
Turkish-Armenian border.  Both noted, however, that Armenia 
would also need to explicitly reject any territorial claims 
on Turkey.  (Comment:  However, the Turkish MFA has told us 
in Ankara, Armenian recognition of the border is not 
sufficient for Turkey to open the border or restore 
diplomatic relations; concessions on the occupied territories 
would have to be part of any package that would do the trick. 
 End Comment).  Turan opined that this could be accomplished 
by measures short of rewriting the Armenian Declaration of 
Independence and Constitution, perhaps even \"a simple 
parliamentary resolution\" would do.  Turkmen averred 
separately that he thought a statement that explicitly refers 
to the appropriate articles in the 1921 Moscow and Kars 
Agreements would be sufficient.  According to Turkmen, the 
Armenian members of TARC also agreed on the need for such a 
statement.  Turan added, however, that some kind of 
\"face-saving\" measures might also need to be taken to give 
Azerbaijan the cover it would need to accede to such a 
development. 
 
 
Viennese Armenian-Turkish Platform 
---------------------------------- 
4. (u) A separate initiative, the Viennese Armenian-Turkish 
Platform (sometimes referred to as the Turkish-Armenian 
Historical Commission) is also making an effort to tackle the 
\"genocide\" issue directly.  Academics from both Armenia and 
Turkey, presumably with permission from their governments, 
have already exchanged historical information and documents 
and are due to meet in Vienna on July 25.  This initial 
meeting is ostensibly to prepare for a more formal meeting to 
take place next spring.  Judging by recent anti-Armenian 
statements of Yusuf Halacoglu, President of the Turkish 
History Institution and the senior Turkish participant, the 
commission will be hard-pressed to find much middle ground 
between the two sides.  Halacoglu also co-authored a new book 
that debunks Armenian \"genocide\" claims, including a 
\"mathematical\" refutation of the much-cited assertion that 
1.5 million Armenians perished in that period. 
 
 
Visit of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev 
------------------------------------------- 
5. (c) Armenia-bashing was the dominant theme of Azeri 
President Aliyev,s April 13-15 visit to Turkey.  Azerbaijani 
Ambassador Mehmed Nevruzoglu Aliyev, Azerbaijani Consul 
General Ibrahim Nebioglu Yagubov and DCM Abdullahyev have all 
told us that the primary agenda item for the visit was \"to 
put an end\" to any plans to relax the current Turkish border 
restrictions with Armenia.  Ambassador Aliyev claims that 
while there may have been some support for a border opening 
at the \"mid-levels of the Turkish bureaucracy\" (Comment:  A 
misperception: see reftels and previous.  End Comment.), 
senior Turkish officials disavowed any plans for such 
measures in their meetings with President Aliyev. 
 
 
Visit of Catholicos Karekin II 
------------------------------ 
6. (c) Catholicos Karekin II of Echmiadzin has been planning 
a visit to Turkey (the last such visit was made several years 
ago by his predecessor).  Kaan Soyak, Co-Chairman of the 
Turkish-Armenian Business Development Council, told poloff 
that he had been passing messages between Yerevan and Ankara 
and thought that such a visit might take place as soon as 
this year.  However, Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II, who has 
been consulting with Ecumenical Patriarch Batholomew (who 
would likely invite the Catholicos for an ecumenical visit) 
told poloff that he had recommended that the visit be 
postponed to 2006.  Mesrob argued that he was unprepared for 
a visit this year and that with 2005 being the 90th 
anniversary of the \"genocide,\" tensions would be too high for 
such a visit before Spring 2006.  Even then, Mesrob added, he 
would not \"allow\" the Catholicos to visit any sensitive sites 
in eastern Turkey for fear that this would simply exacerbate 
tensions.  (Comment: Inter-church politics and unresolved 
tension between Mesrob and Karekin (which Mesrob attributes 
to Karekin\'s \"overly politicized\" nature) may have influenced 
Mesrob\'s desire to postpone the visit.  Embassy Ankara and 
ConGen Istanbul would be interested in Embassy Yerevan\'s 
views on the subject of a possible visit by Karekin).

SUBJECT: \"WE\'RE HERE TO HELP YOU\": NEW COMMISSION DISPLAYS 
OLD ATTITUDES ON RELIGIOUS MINORITY ISSUES 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
 
1. (c) Summary: A delegation of the new inter-ministerial 
commission charged with resolving outstanding minority issues 
visited Istanbul in January to meet with the leaders of the 
religious communities and to follow up on complaints that the 
religious leaders had passed to Prime Minister Erdogan last 
fall.  Although this commission replaced the now-abolished 
(and previously scret) \"Minority Control Commission,\" its 
delegaton to Istanbul clearly demonstrated that old habits 
die hard.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (c) The EcumenicalPatriarchate and the Armenian Orthodox 
Patriarchshared their accounts of January 20 meetings with 
delgaionfr 
nkra sent by the new inter-miiseral 
cmmssin harged with resolving the miority communities\' 
outstanding human rights and eligious freedoms issues.  Both 
Metropoliton Melton (the Ecumenical Patriarch\'s de facto 
chief aviser) and Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II remarked o 
the composition of the delegaton-- mbassador olukbasi, 
two other repreenttiesfrm te inistry of Foreign 
Affairs,andon frm he Ministry of Interior (they were 
joined by a representative from the Istanbul Polie 
Department) -- as yet another indication of how the Turkish 
government continues to treat the minority communities as 
\"foreigners\" in their own country.  dditionally, rather than 
conduct the meetings in their personal offices, the religious 
leaders were asked to come to the Governor\'s office where 
(after being greeted by the Governor) they met with the 
government delegation. 
 
 
3. (c) Patriarchal Elections: The Greek Orthodox Community 
has long complained about requirements (based only on 
pronouncements by the Istanbul Governor) that those voting 
and those elected to serve as the Patriarch and on the Holy 
Synod be Turkish citizens.  With less than 3000 Greek 
Orthodox left in Turkey, the community\'s ability to produce 
qualified clergy and its very sustainability are in doubt. 
 
 
Following up on these concerns, the delegation insisted on 
the legality and the continued applicability of these 
restrictions.  Bolukbasi also questioned whether it would 
ever be possible to confer Turkish citizenship on a 
non-Turkish Patriarch, as was done with Patriarch Athenagoras 
in 1948 (Note: Athenagoras, an American citizen and then 
Archbishop of America, was elected as Ecumenical Patriarch 
with the support of the U.S., Greek, and Turkish governments 
at the time.  End Note).  Rather than address the community\'s 
underlying concern about its long-term viability, Bolukbasi 
simply suggested that current restrictions be maintained and 
a new legal procedure be established for future elections. 
In his meeting with Mesrob, Bolukbasi indicated that they 
hoped to use a draft regulation that he had proposed after 
his own election as a model for the other communities. 
 
 
4. (c) Halki Seminary: Closed since 1971, the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate hopes to reopen this school under its former 
status (i.e., largely independent).  The Turkish government 
has insisted that as a \"higher education\" institution, it can 
only be reopened as a part of a university under the direct 
control of the Higher Education Council. 
 
 
On this issue, Bolukbasi pointed to the declining numbers of 
Greek Orthodox in Turkey and questioned whether such a 
seminary would find enough students in order to be 
financially viable.  In response to the Patriarch\'s request 
that the school be reopened under its prior status as a 
\"vocational high school\" and be able to educate foreign 
seminarians, Bolukbasi simply said that any school providing 
4 years of post-high school education could not be so 
classified and that foreign students would need special 
permission to study there (and would be banned from working 
in Turkey in any case).  Bolukbasi insisted that the school 
could only be opened under the authority of the Higher 
Education Council, i.e., as a faculty of an existing 
university.  The Armenian community has no desire to open a 
seminary (its priests are trained in Jerusalem), but Mesrob 
noted the need for a college or university faculty that could 
teach the Armenian language, literature, and culture. 
 
 
5. (c) Orphanage: A historically-significant orphanage on 
Buyukada that once belonged to the Greek Orthodox community 
has fallen into disrepair.  The Ecumenical Patriarchate 
discontinued plans to renovate the building (and rent it out 
as a hotel) when its ownership was challenged by the Turkish 
government. 
 
 
While refusing to acknowledge the Patriarchate\'s legal title 
to the property, Bolukbasi nevertheless urged the Patriarch 
to cooperate in having the building restored.  (Note: 
Subsequent to this meeting the orphanage was formally 
expropriated by the state). 
 
 
6. (c) Other Issues: Bolukbasi deflected a request to have 
the 1936 foundations law amended to give the state the power 
to return expropriated properties.  Asked to help obtain 
residence permits for foreign clergy (who are obliged to 
leave Turkey every 3 months to renew their tourist visas), 
Bolukbasi merely suggested that they submit applications to 
the relevant authorities (Note: A previous such applicant had 
been deported as a result). 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
7. (c) The mere fact of the visit and the desire to put an 
end to the problems of the religious communities represents 
progress of a sort.  But the reported attitudes of the 
delegation in the meetings does not bode well for the 
resolution of these outstanding issues in the near-to-medium 
term.  Mesrob himself noted that the participation of 
Ambassador Bolukbasi was \"particularly unfortunate and 
discouraging\" since this diplomat \"is believed to be an 
inveterate proponent of the traditional Kemalist line 
concerning minority issues.\"

1.  (U)  Summary:  Prime Ministry human rights Director Vahit 
Bicak offered an upbeat assessment of Turkey\'s progress in 
addressing religious minority foundations\' legal issues at a 
May 15 NGO-organized symposium.  Nonetheless, religious 
minority foundations stressed that they still face serious 
challenges.  Foundations are finding it difficult in some 
cases to transfer the registration of property they control 
from individuals\' names (including Jesus and Mary, on 
occasion) to the foundations\' names.  Moreover, the 
government has approved only a handful of their petitions to 
recover seized properties.  Turkey\'s implementation of EU 
reforms, especially as regards religious minorites\' property 
rights, remains incomplete.  End Summary. 
 
 
The Good... 
----------- 
2.  (SBU) Representatives of religious groups, academia and 
government attended a May 15 symposium organized by the 
Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation (TESEV) to 
discuss the legal problems still facing religious minority 
foundations after the passage of reform laws some 18 months 
ago (refs A through D).  Vahit Bicak, Chairman of the Prime 
Ministry\'s Human Rights Commission, was a presenter at two 
sessions, and he seemed to go over well with the potentially 
critical audience.  (Note: symposium organizers tell us that 
Bicak had originally been invited to attend the symposium, 
but that Bicak himself insisted on making the two 
presentations.  End note.)  Having served as an intern/jurist 
for the European Court of Human Rights in 1999, Bicak 
comfortably detailed the European Convention on Human Rights\' 
religious freedom provisions in a morning session.  Speaking 
as a human rights lawyer rather than as a government 
official, his candor was refreshing.  When discussing the 
\"freedom from expressing religious preference to the state,\" 
for example, he acknowledged that this invited discussion of 
Turkey\'s inclusion of religion on the national identity card. 
 
 
 
 
3.  (U)  Bicak closed the symposium with his afternoon speech 
on Turkey\'s accomplishments in the area of religious freedom. 
 The return of property sacred to the Baha\'i community in 
Edirne topped his list of concrete advances.  He also pointed 
to improved dialogue between the government and foundations, 
the ability of foundations to engage in international 
activities, and less onerous requirements for officially 
changing religions.  He claimed that there was an emerging 
consensus that all foundations be considered under one law, 
instead of the current situation which considers religious 
foundations separately from others.  As regards property, he 
pointed to foundations\' ability to register property under 
their own names and a more reasonable deadline for applying 
to recover property.  Bicak also announced that a previously 
secret \"Minority Control Commission\" had been abolished and a 
 
SIPDIS 
new inter-ministerial commission had been appointed to 
resolve outstanding issues with the communities (Ref E). 
 
 
4.  (U)  Adnan Ertem, the Regional Deputy Director of the 
General Directorate for Foundations attended the TESEV 
symposium, and during a Q/A session thanked panelists for 
their \"fair evaluation of positive developments.\"  As the day 
went on he developed a slightly more defensive posture in his 
interventions, but stayed until the bitter end and mostly 
kept his cool despite representing the target of the day\'s 
heaviest criticism.  His participation in the event was 
positive in and of itself.  Moreover, TESEV organizer Cem 
Murat Sofuoglu noted that in a similar symposium two years 
earlier, six police officers had attended.  This time there 
was only one, he said, who had asked permission to attend. 
Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a lawyer representing the Protestant 
community, at one point remarked that \"standards were so low 
that this counts as progress,\" but many agreed that a new and 
more productive attitude, when compared to years past, was 
displayed by the government officials present at the 
symposium. 
 
 
The Bad... 
---------- 
5.  (U) Despite Bicak\'s upbeat tone and the improved 
atmospherics, religious minority foundations continue to face 
problems.  The regulations which came into effect in January 
2003, for example, allow religious minority foundations to 
apply to the General Directorate for Foundations to register 
\"property already at their disposal,\" but not registered in 
the foundation\'s name.  At the symposium, Ata Sakmar, a 
lawyer affiliated with the Greek Orthodox community, 
explained one reason why some such applications have been 
rejected.  In the past, Greek Orthodox properties were often 
registered in the name of individuals in order to avoid 
expropriation, and many were actually registered in the name 
of \"Jesus\" or \"Mary.\"  According to Sakmar, in the absence of 
the official registrant\'s consent to changing the 
registration to a foundation\'s name, these petitions are 
rejected.  \"I almost had to author a communique to summon 
Jesus to the courtroom last year\", he said, \"in order to 
submit successful applications to the General Directorate.\" 
 
 
6.  (U)  A negligible number of petitions to recover property 
that had been seized by the government has been granted.  In 
addition to difficulties in recovering properties seized 
since 1935, there is still the outstanding question of 
properties expropriated and/or disposed of by the government 
prior to 1935.  It is not clear whether the 2002 reforms even 
allow for applications to reclaim such property.  In any 
case, implementation of the spirit if not the letter of the 
reform measures passed in 2002 remains elusive. 
 
 
And the Tense... 
--------------- 
7.  (SBU)  Istanbul Muftu Cagrici was among three religious 
leaders invited to make opening remarks at the TESEV event. 
While the Armenian Orthodox and Ecumenical Orthodox 
Patriarchs sent representatives in their stead, Dr. Cagrici 
not only delivered his remarks personally, but stayed 
throughout the day and participated actively, and for the 
most part, constructively. In a comment that provided an 
insight into the \"us vs. them\" mentality deeply engrained in 
some government bureaucrats, however, he implied that perhaps 
Turkey\'s Law 1062, the so-called \"Reciprocity Law,\" might be 
appropriate to consider in response to restrictions on ethnic 
Turks in Western Thrace.  Numerous participants rejected that 
idea, stating that the Reciprocity Law \"should not even be 
mentioned here,\" as it is meant to affect nationals of 
foreign states, not Turkish citizens. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
8.  (SBU)   The mere fact that this conference (reportedly 
only the second to be held on this subject since the 2002 
reform measures were passed) took place with the 
participation of the Muftu and attendance and interventions 
by a representative of the Foundations Directorate is a 
welcome development.  Discussion was open and lively, but as 
the reference to Western Thrace clearly indicated, the 
religious minorities continue to be subjected to an \"us vs. 
them\" attitude by state bureaucrats (e.g., minority groups 
still fall under the \"Foreigners\" Branch of the Istanbul 
Police Department).  Changing societal and bureaucratic 
attitudes that figure into the development of religious 
freedom policies will be at least as difficult as legislating 
property returns.  But as one participant noted at the end of 
the day, \"It would be strange if transformation -- and we are 
talking about transformation here -- were easy.\"

SUBJECT: TURKEY RAISES NORTHERN CYPRUS AVIATION LINKS IN 
ISTANBUL TRANSPORTATION BILATERAL; OTHER ISSUES INCLUDE THY 
PROCUREMENT AND BOSPHORUS SHIPPING 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta 
and his visiting delegation reviewed the bilateral 
transportation relationship with Turkish Minister of 
Transportation Binali Yildirim in a full day of meetings in 
Istanbul on Monday, May 24.  Yildirim took the opportunity to 
press for the establishment of direct aviation links as part 
of the U.S. review of its policy towards Northern Cyprus. 
Secretary Mineta responded that that review is ongoing, and 
 
SIPDIS 
that we are committed to ensuring that Turkish Cypriots are 
not \"punished\" as a result of the outcome of last month\'s 
referendum.  The two ministers also reviewed the gamut of 
other transportation issues, stressing the benefits that both 
sides have gained in the civil aviation area from our \"open 
skies\" agreement, and exploring possible areas of cooperation 
on maritime and land transport.  The Secretary made a strong 
pitch for Boeing aircraft in Turkish Airlines\' (THY) current 
procurement decision; THY officials responded that price and 
technical issues are key, and that the process is \"close to 
conclusion.\"  In the afternoon, the two Ministers toured the 
Bosphorus and received a briefing at the headquarters of the 
Vessel Traffic System (VTS) in Istinye.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Cyprus: The major bilateral issue on Yildirim\'s 
agenda was transportation linkage to Northern Cyprus.  He 
expressed appreciation for U.S. efforts to secure a 
settlement in the run-up to last month\'s referendum, and 
noted that while Turkey would have preferred a \"yes-yes\" 
outcome to the referendum, since that had not happened it is 
now focused on seeking removal of the \"unfair restrictions\" 
that the international community has imposed on the Turkish 
side of the island.  He noted that Turkey is grateful for 
U.S. steps to do this, and expressed hope that direct flights 
would be one of the measures adopted.  Yildirim noted that 
Northern Cyprus has worked to bring its ports and airports up 
to international standards, and provided documentation to 
that effect to the Secretary.  Secretary Mineta responded 
that our review of our Cyprus policy is underway, and that we 
are committed to ending the isolation of Turkish Cypriots and 
ensuring that they are not punished as a result of the 
referendum\'s outcome.  He stressed that we are coordinating 
our actions with the EU, and that better results will be 
obtained if actions are coordinated at the ICAO, and that he 
will speak to our Ambassador there as well.  Ambassador 
Edelman added that our goal is to end Northern Cyprus\' 
economic isolation and help make the economic balance between 
north and south more equal.  To that end, he said, we will 
work both within the U.S. policy process and with 
multilateral institutions. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Aviation: Secretary Mineta stressed the two 
countries\' common interests and noted that our bilateral 
\"open skies\" agreement had proved advantageous to both sides 
(a point with which U.S. companies concurred during a 
business breakfast with the Secretary before his bilateral 
meeting).  On security issues, he noted that lead 
responsibility in the U.S. government has passed to the 
Department of Homeland Security, but emphasized that the 
Department of Transportation remains deeply involved. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Maritime/Land Transport: In response to Secretary 
Mineta\'s outline of his efforts to encourage short-sea 
shipping in the United States to ease road congestion on the 
coasts, Minister Yildirim noted that the same issue exists in 
Turkey.  He attributed Turkey\'s high rate of road accidents 
to the \"lack of balance\" between various transport modes, 
with Turkish shippers primarily using road transportation. 
As a result, he noted, Turkey\'s road fleet is the largest in 
Europe.  The resulting congestion and infrastructure 
deterioration, Yildirim said, explains the high number of 
fatalities on Turkey\'s roads.  He outlined a similar effort 
to encourage freight to move by sea rather than by road. 
 
 
5. (SBU) THY Procurement: In closing, Secretary Mineta 
touched on the upcoming procurement decision by Turkish 
Airlines (THY), emphasizing our hope that the airline and 
government would give serious consideration to Boeing 
aircraft in their deliberations.  Yildirim responded by 
highlighting the dramatic growth that the civil aviation 
sector in Turkey has experienced over the past six months (a 
period in which air travel is up 30 percent).  He attributed 
the development to the entry of private companies into the 
market.  In the face of this private sector competition, he 
indicated, THY, which has also experienced growth, is 
determined to carry through with its fleet expansion plans. 
He then turned the floor over to THY General Manager 
Gundogdu, who emphasized that discussions with Airbus and 
Boeing are ongoing, and that the airline, together with 
Finance Minister Unakitan, will meet with Boeing next week in 
the U.S.  Price and technical issues are key, he said, and he 
suggested that the Secretary talk to Boeing on the price 
issue.  He added that the process is \"close to a conclusion.\" 
 Regarding price, Ambassador Edelman noted that Turkey can 
help itself by adopting the Capetown Convention on aircraft 
financing, which enables U.S. export credit agencies to offer 
better rates.  The Minister responded that the Foreign 
Ministry is now working on the issue, and that the convention 
should be ratified soon. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Bosphorus Shipping: Both in the bilateral meeting 
and during an afternoon Bosphorus tour, Minister Yildirim and 
his maritime deputies emphasized the volume of traffic that 
is transiting the straits.  They noted that nearly 50,000 
ships made the passage last year, some 8,900 of them with 
dangerous cargo.  Vessel Traffic System (VTS) Director Tuncay 
Cehreli provided a detailed briefing on VTS operations during 
a stop at VTS headquarters in Istinye, emphasizing that the 
system is essentially a monitoring one.  While Yildirim 
stressed that the system is not intended to increase or 
decrease traffic, but to increase its safety, he did note 
that with the VTS in place traffic levels have increased in 
the first part of 2004.  Total passages, he said, are up 10 
percent and passages by ships with dangerous cargoes are up 
25 percent.  Turkish officials remain concerned that only 39 
percent of ships request pilots for the tricky and dangerous 
passage through the heart of Istanbul, though they did note 
that 99.5 percent of ships with dangerous cargoes take on a 
pilot, largely for insurance reasons.

1.  Summary:  While European officials assess GOT efforts

Council\'s important December Summit, Turkey\'s de facto 
integration into the cultural life of Europe deepens. 
Turkey\'s hosting of the Eurovision Song Contest in Istanbul,

Hosting Europe\'s \"Uber-Kitsch\" Event 
------------------------------------ 
2.  On May 15, an estimated 100 million viewers across Europe 
tuned in on Turkey as Istanbul hosted the 49th Eurovision 
Song Contest.  For the uninitiated, Eurovision is more than 
an \"American Idol\" talent show.  Thirty-six countries sent 
participants to the contest, and some 4.2 million televoters, 
many of whom paid for the right to vote, determined the 
winner.  It\'s a classic yearly event that combines neighborly 
love with flag-waving patriotism, and inspires viewing 
parties in homes across Europe, much like Oscars night in the 
United States.  (Note:  The show has launched the careers of 
such stars as the group ABBA and Celine Dion.  End note.) 
 
3.  Sertab, Turkey\'s representative in the 2003 contest, won 
the event last year, thus bestowing the honor of hosting this 
year upon her home city.  Turkey\'s newspaper headlines all 
but hailed her victory last year as tantamount to entry into 
the EU itself:  \"She conquered Europe,\" proclaimed Milliyet. 
This year\'s Turkish entry, a ska group called Athena, placed 
a respectable fourth (right between #3 Greece and #5 Cyprus), 
but, more importantly, the event went off smoothly, and 
organizers put on an impressive show for all of Europe to 
watch.  The show was hosted in perfect French and English, 
and spectators in the 10,500 seat arena, sold out months in 
advance, waved Greek, Turkish, FYROM, and Cypriot flags 
almost side by side. 
 
Arts: Popstars and Prizes for Literature, Film 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
4.  Eurovision is just one of many examples of Turkey\'s de 
facto integration into European cultural life.  Turkey\'s 
first international popstar, Tarkan, who has already achieved 
commercial success in several European countries, released 
his fourth album last year and launched a European concert 
tour.  Istanbul-born author Orhan Pamuk is known throughout 
Europe.  His recent novel \"My Name is Red\" won the 
International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2003; this award 
was the latest in a series of European honors dating back to 
his 1991 Prix de la Decouverte Europeenne for the French 
translation of his second novel, \"Sessiz_Ev\" (\"The Quiet 
House\"). 
 
5.  At the Cannes Film Festival in 2003, Turkish artists 
Muzaffer Ozdemir and Emin Toprak won the Best Actor awards, 
and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan won the Grand Prize of the 
Jury, for the film \"Uzak.\"  The same film was named FIPRESCI 
Film of the Year at the San Sebastian International Film 
festival.  (Additionally, Turkish-German director Fatih Akin 
won the Golden Bear for best film honors at the Berlin 
International Film Festival last year for \"Gegen die Wand 
(Head on),\" a film about second-generation Turks in Germany.) 
 
Sports: Turkish Football, the Golden Girl, and the Sultans of 
the Net 
------------ ----------------- --------------------- 
---------------- 
5.  The situation is similar in the sports world.  Turkish 
soccer teams are invariably in the thick of the action, as 
they were in the 2003-2004 UEFA Champions League tournament 
when Istanbul club Besiktas met Chelsea and Istanbul rival 
Galatasaray (the 2000 UEFA Champion) took on Juventas. 
(Note:  Turks were miffed, however, when the games they were 
due to host last year were moved to alternate venues after 
the November Istanbul bombings.  Turks were later quick to 
note that similar changes in venue did not happen after the 
March bombings in Madrid.  Indeed, to highlight the point, 
Turkish teams emphasized their readiness to carry through 
with planned matches in Spain in the bombing\'s aftermath. 
End note.)  Turkish and second-generation Turkish soccer 
stars also feature on a number of top European clubs. 
Although the Turkish national team failed to qualify for EURO 
2004, it is still basking in its third-place World Cup 2002 
finish. 
 
6.  Turkey\'s female athletes often dominate the local sports 
headlines as well.  Elvan Abeylegesse, formerly of Ethiopia 
but now running for Turkey, broke a world record in the 
women\'s 5000-meter event at the Bergen Golden League meeting 
in Norway on June 11.  Track and field star \"Golden Girl\" 
Sureyya Ayhan has been a darling of the European media for 
several years running.  She won the silver medal in last 
fall\'s 1500 meters final at the 9th World Athletic 
Championship in Saint Denis, France, and shortly thereafter 
set a world record in Belgium\'s Van Damme Golden League 
Tournament.  Turks also took great pride in this year\'s 
second-place European finish of the \"Sultans of the Net,\" the 
national Women\'s Volleyball Team, and the victory of one of 
its club teams in the European Women\'s Volleyball 
Championship. 
 
7.   In sum, European public opinion may be skeptical about 
the politics of GOT joining the European Union, but civil 
society has shown that sharing space with Turkey in the 
cultural realm is as natural as can be.

SUBJECT: HALKI:  REAL PROGRESS AT LAST? 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b & d) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary and Comment:  The Ecumenical Patriarchate, 
having learned through a variety of sources that the 
government is reportedly working to reopen the Halki 
Seminary, is optimistic this could happen in September. 
According to the Patriarchate, the proposal purportedly under 
development by the government would be the most forthcoming 
to date, but still would not open the school to foreign 
seminarians.  Government officials so far are not able to 
confirm that any new proposals are in the works.  Previously, 
the Patriarchate has refused to budge from its red lines on 
this issue.  This latest optimism suggests that they may be 
inclined to pocket this offer, if it comes, and to continue 
working to redress outstanding concerns.  At the same time, 
coming just before the NATO Summit and the President\'s visit, 
the GOT may be hoping to use this opportunity to look good 
and make progress on this long-standing issue.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  In a June 18 meeting at the Ecumenical Patriarchate, 
Metropolitan Meliton of Philadelphia (the Ecumenical 
Patriarch\'s de facto Chief of Staff) told poloff he is 
optimistic about the chances for Halki Seminary being opened 
in September, and he confirmed that Ecumenical Patriarch 
Bartholomew I told the press that the Orthodox seminary would 
be opened in the new academic year, as reported June 17 in 
the Turkish daily Cumhuriyet.  According to Meliton, the 
Patriarch met last week with Prime Ministry officials after 
participating in a court case involving a dismissed Bulgarian 
priest, and learned that the government is preparing a 
solution in which Halki Seminary would be opened directly 
under the Ministry of Education, rather than as part of a 
university under the control of the Higher Education Council 
(YOK).  The Metropolitan received a similar message last week 
from unnamed MFA sources. 
 
3.  (C) Such a proposal would ease a major stumbling block in 
resolving the issue, as the Patriarchate has demanded that 
the school be opened under its former, largely independent, 
status.  The catch, however, is that from what Patriarchate 
officials have heard, the school would be opened only for 
Turkish citizens.  In light of the dwindling numbers of Greek 
Orthodox in Turkey (approximately 2000-3000), opening Halki 
for Turkish citizens only would be just a first step and not 
a sustainable solution for the long term, according to 
Meliton.  Nevertheless, \"this is good,\" he said.  If the 
school is to be opened, \"now is the time,\" he said, \"with the 
visit of President Bush.\"  The Patriarchate is still working 
out its exact response to a possible government announcement, 
Meliton said, but his general reaction appeared to be 
positive. 
 
4.  (C) If the offer is made, the school could open as early 
as September, and thus the Patriarchate would have to get 
busy this summer in order to be ready to open it.  As it 
stands now, at least four individuals would be ready and 
qualified to serve as staff members, including Meliton 
himself.  The budget for the school would come from the 
Patriarchate, he said. 
 
5.  (C)  Following this meeting, emboffs spoke with several 
Education Ministry officials in Ankara, but were unable to 
confirm that any new proposals for reopening Halki were in 
the works.  A diplomat from the MFA Department of Greek 
Affairs said he \"could not confirm or deny\" the reports on 
Halki.  On June 20, Radikal daily quotes YOK Chairman Tezic 
himself as raising problems with Halki Seminary falling under 
YOK (as GOT has repeatedly proposed), and suggesting instead 
that Halki Seminary would be most appropriately supervised by 
the Ministry of Education.  For this to happen, Radikal added 
that some legislative reforms would be required.

SUBJECT: A/S JONES MEETING WITH IRAQI FM ZIBARI AND IRAQI 
MOD SHA\'ALAN 
 
 
Classified By: A/S Elizabeth Jones for Reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  During the run-up to the Istanbul Summit 
June 27, A/S Jones and CPA Foreign Policy Director Ronald 
Neumann discussed Iraq\'s security challenges and a new 
NATO-Iraq relationship with Iraqi FM Zibari and Iraqi MoD 
Sha\'alan.  Jones and Zibari agreed that their informal 
meeting with NATO foreign ministers June 27 would be an 
important event both symbolically and practically.   Zibari 
said that Iraq had lost much time due to the occupation, but 
that he believed the new Iraqi cabinet members 
were willing to \"risk everything\" to overcome the terrorist 
threat and build the new Iraq.  Zibari and Sha\'alan stressed 
the Ministry of Defense desperately needed equipment, as well 
as training, for Iraq\'s security forces.  Zibari also said 
that Iraqi PM Allawi recently clarified that the Iraqi 
Interim Government (IIG) did not want Turkish units on Iraqi 
soil, but that Turkish training officers and headquarters 
staff were welcome.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Important Beginning 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Prior to the informal Foreign Ministers Meeting June 
27, Jones told Iraqi FM Zibari and Iraqi MoD Sha\'alan that 
Iraqi PM Allawi\'s letter to NATO Secretary General de Hoop 
Scheffer requesting Alliance support for Iraq was a very 
important beginning to the new NATO-Iraq relationship.  The 
informal NATO meeting was an important event, both 
symbolically and practically, as NATO Allies would have the 
opportunity to hear views from Iraqis directly.  Jones said 
that although NATO was already providing support to the 
Polish-led Multinational Division, Allied leaders would 
decide at the Istanbul Summit June 28 to ask NATO to take on 
a collective mission to train the Iraqi security forces.  A 
NATO training mission was significant because it would lead 
to a comprehensive approach; Iraqi authorities could 
coordinate directly with NATO, which would help match 
training requirements with member-state capabilities.  Jones 
said that the NATO Military Committee had ideas on how NATO 
could support Iraq, but that those ideas were not worth 
anything unless Iraqi leaders are engaged in developing them. 
 
-------------------------- 
To Rule is To Decide 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Zibari said he is finding that \"to rule is to decide\" 
and he believes that the new cabinet is made up of people who 
are willing to \"risk everything\" to fight in the struggle to 
build the new Iraq.  Zibari said that terrorists, 
anti-democratic forces, Ba\'athists and many regional 
countries are trying to make the new Iraq fail.  He said they 
would not win, but they would delay progress and make it 
difficult to succeed. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
IIG Progressing, Gaining Political Support 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4.   (C) FM Zibari thanked Jones and the State NEA Bureau for 
efforts to overcome difficulties over the past year.  He was 
pleased that the hard work on smaller issues had now opened 
the way to address more strategic decisions.  Zibari agreed 
that the informal Foreign Ministers meeting was important and 
said that Allawi had prepped him to request training and 
other types of support.  He also said that this meeting -- 
similar to the recent G-8 Sea Island Summit and the 
Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) conference -- would 
have a big impact in Iraq and a political statement by the 
Alliance was important to recognize the progressive and 
positive stage the IIG had achieved. 
 
----------------------------- 
Water Under the Bridge 
----------------------------- 
 
5.   (C) Zibari said that he had warned the U.S. not to move 
from liberator to occupier, and that even the closest friends 
of the U.S. had gone back on it.  He complained that Iraq had 
lost time, lost men, and lost money, but that this was \"water 
under the bridge\" and the IIG now has a new opportunity to 
address the country\'s needs.  According to Zibari, it is 
vital to demonstrate that the transfer of sovereignty is 
real, i.e. that ministries are spending money, purchasing 
equipment, and reaching out to other countries.  No one wants 
the return of Saddam, or a \"little Saddam\"; no one wants 
extremists or a theocracy, but people want the confidence 
that they can build their own future. 
 
-------------- 
Up to Iraqis 
-------------- 
 
6.   (C) Zibari said Iraq needs security to make this goal 
happen.  He said that CPA had encouraged Iraq\'s leaders to 
open their borders and relax their rules to encourage 
investment, but that without security, efforts to revitalize 
the economy would fail.  To achieve these goals, Zibari said 
they would need NATO\'s support. 
 
7.   (C) Zibari said that in the end, however, Iraq\'s future 
will depend on Iraqis and that it will be crucial to have the 
right Iraqi leaders.  He regretted that most Iraqis were 
trained with weapons and that even the opposition had to take 
up arms.  Zibari said the key was to find the right people to 
stand up and challenge this.  He said the cabinet was aware 
of the risks  -- car bombs, assassins, plots  -- but that it 
could not give up. 
---------------------- 
...And Equipping? 
---------------------- 
8.  (C) Jones shared highlights of the draft Political 
Statement on Iraq to which Allied leaders would agree at the 
Istanbul Summit.  Zibari asked why the statement only 
mentioned that Allies had decided to provide training, but 
not equipment.  Jones said that the U.S. concept included 
both training and equipping Iraqi security forces, and she 
encouraged them to tell NATO Foreign Ministers of their 
priorities for assistance. 
 
9.  (C) Zibari said that the Iraqi army needs 
counterintelligence training and equipment so that it can be 
a visible deterrence force.  Iraq has thousands of police, 
but not enough weapons, cars, or communications.  Zibari said 
NATO could help in many areas, but that he understood some 
Allies wanted to \"settle certain scores\" and were reluctant 
to send troops to Iraq.  Zibari said Allies could help in 
other ways, such as with training and equipment; his contacts 
tell him that Italy and Germany were open to this type of 
support.  However, U.S. support was most critical in his view. 
 
10.  (C) MoD Sha\'alan added that the Ministry of Defense is a 
new ministry and is \"in need of everything.\"  According to 
Sha\'alan, Iraq\'s security forces need weapons, light 
aircraft, vehicles, and command and control communications 
equipment.  He said that Iraq faced serious threats from 
border infiltrations, and that training on NATO\'s high-tech 
border control techniques, modern communications, and 
leadership training would be crucial.  Sha\'alan stressed that 
weapons training required weapons, however, and that Iraq 
needed NATO\'s help in this area.  He asked for help in 
pressing Gulf states to finance Iraq\'s equipment needs. 
Jones said that a new NATO International Cooperation 
Initiative (ICI), which would be launched in Istanbul, would 
open the door to security cooperation with Gulf states and 
other countries.  She suggested that this new framework might 
help to bring support to Iraq from Gulf states. 
 
--------------------- 
Time and Turkey 
--------------------- 
 
11.  (C) Zibari stressed that time was an important factor 
and that they could not afford a lengthy process for 
assistance.  Jones said that according to the Alliance 
decision, NATO must develop modalities \"on an urgent basis\" 
for implementing the decision.  Zibari also said that PM 
Allawi recently clarified that the IIG did not want Turkish 
units on Iraqi soil, but that Turkish training and 
headquarters staff were welcome.

     B. ANKARA 01233 
 
1.  Summary:  Secretary Powell and FM Gul witnessed the 
signing of a protocol that will lead to the opening of 
Turkey\'s first shelter for trafficking in persons victims 
later this month.  The signing ceremony, which attracted 
significant attention and publicity, publicly committed the 
Turkish government and the Istanbul Municipality to support 
this initiative.  Although a modest step in Turkey\'s 
fledgling efforts to combat TIP, the shelter and the enhanced 
cooperation between Turkish authorities and NGOs represent a 
sea change in official attitudes on this issue.  USG pressure 
has helped focus GOT attention on its anti-TIP programs, but 
tight budgets and competing priorities will likely impede the 
long-term progress that can only come from substantial 
investments in training, assistance, and public education. 
End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
TIP Shelter Signing Ceremony 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  On June 29 Secretary Powell witnessed the signing of a 
protocol between the Istanbul Municipality and Turkish NGO 
Human Resources Development Foundation (HRDF)  setting the 
stage for the opening of Turkey\'s first-ever shelter for 
victims of trafficking in persons.  The Secretary, in 
Istanbul for the NATO Summit, made remarks at the signing 
ceremony, along with Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.  The 
event put the Municipality\'s support for the shelter on the 
public record, as it committed itself to provide a property 
to house the program.  The municipality\'s contribution, a 
result at least in part of USG pressure and subsequent MFA 
and Ministry of Interior intervention, marks an important 
milestone in GOT anti-trafficking protection efforts. 
 
3.  The presence of the Secretary and FM Gul at the signing 
ceremony attracted widespread media attention (Ref A), and 
was an excellent opportunity for public education about the 
trafficking in persons issue in Turkey.  The Secretary 
pointed out that the protection of human liberty and dignity 
is part of NATO\'s mandate, and that NATO countries had 
developed the first ever anti-trafficking policy by an 
Alliance.  FM Gul stated that Turkey is committed to the 
worldwide effort against trafficking; Turkey\'s legal 
framework already reflects this and now the country is taking 
concrete measures to implement these laws.  Efforts by the 
American-Turkish Council have resulted in contributions from 
American companies toward the shelter\'s operating costs, and 
two local representatives of Altria/Philip Morris were on 
hand to present a check for $45,000 to HRDF.  Municipality 
officials, HRDF board members, the Istanbul representative of 
the International Organization on Migration (IOM) and 
numerous journalists also attended the event. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
GOT-NGO Anti-TIP Cooperation Improving 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  The GOT (Ministry of Interior) signed agreements in the 
last several months with HRDF and IOM to cooperate on a 
number of anti-TIP efforts (Ref B, post\'s submission to 2004 
TIP report).  Turkish police, upon identifying potential TIP 
victims when carrying out raids, now contact HRDF and IOM so 
that these organizations can provide medical and legal 
assistance.  IOM Istanbul rep Murat Kalkan told us recently 
that the police alerted them to 20 TIP cases in the first two 
months following conclusion of their agreement this spring 
(all involved Ukrainian and Moldovan women in Adana, Ankara, 
and Istanbul).  HRDF Executive Director Demet Gural confirmed 
they are also enjoying good cooperation with police officials 
in this regard.  To date, however, there has been no place 
for TIP victims to stay and await assistance, and too often 
victims have been forced to leave the country before 
receiving the help they need.  According to Gural, the new 
shelter facility, due to open later this month, will be able 
to accommodate 12-15 women.  The municipality has paid a 
year\'s rent in advance for the facility, which will be housed 
-- at least for its first year of existence -- in a duplex 
apartment in Istanbul.  The municipality is also covering all 
utilities.  HRDF will be seeking a larger, more permanent, 
state-owned property to house the shelter starting in its 
second year of operation. 
 
5.  The shelter is partially furnished, and one of HRDF\'s 
founding members has donated additional furniture and kitchen 
appliances to meet its immediate needs.  Embassy Ankara has 
organized a clothes and supplies drive that will provide 
additional resources to the shelter.  HRDF\'s project 
coordinator, Dr. Muhtar Cokar, will work along with 
psychotherapist Serra Akkaya and legal advisor Hasan Kemal 
Elban in implementing the project.  HRDF is currently 
recruiting for a full-time, tri-lingual (Turkish, Russian, 
Moldovan) \"cultural mediator\" who will live in the shelter 
and staff the shelter\'s hotline.  The shelter will be 
equipped with security cameras, purchased with a portion of 
the funds contributed by Philip Morris.  As soon as the 
cultural mediator is identified, the shelter will be open for 
business; HRDF staff estimates that all will be in place by 
the end of July. 
 
---------------- 
Regional Efforts 
---------------- 
 
6.  On a separate note, HRDF is involved in a September 
conference on border trafficking of minors scheduled to take 
place in Edirne (on the Turkish border with Bulgaria).  The 
conference is designed for Turkish and Bulgarian NGOs and law 
enforcement agencies, but HRDF is looking for funding to 
bring Moldovan participants as well.  AMCONGEN Istanbul has 
been in touch with AMEMB Chisinau regarding possible funding 
sources.  This type of regional cooperation among NGOs seems 
to be the norm for HRDF.  When visiting HRDF in May, two 
visiting Moldovan NGO representatives were on their way back 
home via Istanbul after having been in Dubai assisting in the 
repatriation of a Moldovan TIP victim.  From July 16-30, 
HRDF\'s Armenian NGO partner, Hope and Help, is due to visit 
Istanbul, Ankara, Trabzon, Hopa, Rize and Antalya.  In 
Istanbul, Hope and Help will meet with Gural and AMCONGEN TIP 
officer.  The NGO will then meet with MFA TIP officials in 
Ankara.  At each of their stops, Hope and Help 
representatives have scheduled meetings with partner NGOs, 
Georgian and Russian Consulate officials, TIP officers from 
the Turkish National Police, and Armenian victims of 
trafficking.

SUBJECT: ARMENIAN \"GENOCIDE\" AND THE OTTOMAN ARCHIVES 
 
Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
This is a joint CG Istanbul/Embassy Ankara message. 
 
1. (sbu) Summary: The lack of agreement and dialogue on the 
so-called Armenian \"genocide\" question remains a major 
obstacle to Turkish-Armenian rapprochement.  A long-term 
resolution of this problematic issue can only be built on an 
open dialogue and healthy academic debate.  Free and complete 
access to the Ottoman archives, one of the primary 
repositories for historical evidence during this period, will 
be critical to building the mutual trust needed for such a 
debate.  Although Turkey has made great strides to open the 
archives and destigmatize the issue, persistent problems and 
doubts about the archives continue to undermine efforts to 
bridge the gulf of misunderstanding between Armenians and 
Turks on this historical question.  End Summary. 
 
2. (u) The most significant obstacle to Turkish-Armenian 
reconciliation remains a lack of agreement or even healthy 
dialogue on the Armenian \"question\" or what most Turks refer 
to as the \"supposed genocide.\"  The accusations, denials, and 
counter-accusations on this issue have long obscured most 
genuine academic debate.  Armenian diaspora scholars have 
amassed scores of eyewitness accounts and narratives 
detailing the tragic events of 1915-16 that they claim 
amounted to a genocide of as many as 1.5 million Armenians 
living in the Ottoman Empire.  Turkish historians, meanwhile, 
have argued that no more than a few hundred thousand 
Armenians were killed by bandits, disease, and harsh 
conditions when, in response to the threat posed by Armenian 
insurgents (and the \"massacre\" of many Turkish Muslims), much 
of the Armenian population was deported to Syria and Lebanon. 
 
A Question of Identity 
---------------------- 
3. (sbu) In addition to thousands of years of recorded 
history, a rich cultural heritage, and a vibrant Church, for 
Armenians around the world the 1915-16 events remain a 
crucial component of their modern identity.  Although some 
Armenians have at times sought retribution through terror and 
violence (including ASALA terrorism in the 1970s), focus has 
shifted to a tireless political campaign for recognition of 
the events as genocide. 
 
4. (sbu) The Turkish approach to the Armenian issue is 
complex.  From the inception of the Republic, Ataturk and his 
establishment heirs have asserted that maintenance of a 
\"Turkish identity\" -- which Ataturk and his circle developed 
as an artificial construct and which his political heirs 
claim is under threat from domestic and foreign enemies -- is 
essential to the preservation and development of the 
Republic.  Representatives of both the Turkish state and 
every government to date believe that acknowledging any 
wrongs inflicted on the Armenians would call into question 
Turkey\'s own claims of victimization and its borders, and 
would make Turkey vulnerable to claims for indemnity. 
Decades of official denial and the absence of historical 
accounts or academic debate within Turkey on this taboo issue 
have deprived Turks today of an objective context in which to 
process assertions of genocide. 
 
Are the Archives Open? 
---------------------- 
5. (sbu) Both sides have attempted to use the Ottoman 
Archives to support their version of events.  The Turks have 
published volumes of documents to bolster their case, while 
Armenian scholars charge that the Turkish government\'s 
obstruction of free access to the archives suggests that they 
are hiding the \"smoking gun\" that would prove the genocide. 
Armenian scholars have long complained that they could not 
obtain access permits or were obstructed in their research in 
the archives.  Others point to long (and, they say, 
deliberate) delays in securing permits that often consumed 
most or all of the time available on grants or sabbaticals. 
Kevork Bardakchian, head of the Armenian Studies program at 
the University of Michigan, for example, told poloff that he 
and other colleagues were simply denied without explanation 
when they applied for access to the archives in the 1970s and 
1980s.  An Archive Director in this period spoke openly about 
the need to \"protect\" the documents from misuse by hostile 
foreigners. 
 
6. (sbu) Turkish and foreign scholars agree that former PM 
and President Turgut Ozal made a real push to open the 
archives in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The records were 
placed under the supervision of the Prime Ministry, 
procedures for obtaining research permits were simplified, 
and efforts to catalog the 150 million documents were 
accelerated.  Everyone we have spoken to concedes that this 
represented a \"sea change\" that has continued to this day. 
According to Turkish archive officials, permits are usually 
granted within a week, archival staff are helpful, and 
photocopies of desired documents are readily available at 
reasonable fees.  When poloff visited the Ottoman Archive 
research room earlier this month, the staff showed him a 
computerized list of over 300 Americans who have received 
permission to conduct research there in recent years (over 30 
so far this year alone).  The catalogs are also freely 
available through the Archive website over the internet. 
 
7. (sbu) Some restrictions on access remain in place. 
Turkish officials do not permit access to over 70 million 
still-uncatalogued documents and claim that many others are 
too damaged for use by researchers.  Moreover, some critics 
still complain that the Turkish government seeks to block 
those researching the Armenian question.  Prime Ministry 
State Archive Director Yusuf Sarinay pointed out to poloff 
that researchers must be legally in Turkey for that purpose, 
which requires visa approval by the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  Some researchers continue to have permits delayed 
or denied altogether (Greek researchers have also been 
victims of such discrimination in the past).  Archive 
Director Sarinay said that although many American researchers 
have come to the archives, notably not one has come from 
Armenia.  He speculated that this was because there are no 
diplomatic relations between Turkey and Armenia - and because 
of a policy of reciprocity for Armenia supposedly not 
allowing Turkish researchers into its archives.  Turkey\'s own 
preeminent Ottoman historian, Halil Inalcik, criticized the 
Archives\' lack of openness in a February 2001 editorial for 
Radikal daily entitled \"The Ottoman Archives Should Be Opened 
to the World.\"  Despite the criticism, however, the mantra 
today is \"openness\" and any talk of \"protecting\" the archives 
from foreigners is politically incorrect.  Although the 
Archives Director still has considerable authority to deny 
access, he would be hard-pressed to explain placing such 
restrictions on any serious academic researcher. 
 
Have the Archives Been Purged? 
------------------------------ 
8. (c) Perhaps more important than the question of access, 
however, is whether or not the archives themselves are 
complete.  According to Sabanci University Professor Halil 
Berktay, there were two serious efforts to \"purge\" the 
archives of any incriminating documents on the Armenian 
question.  The first took place in 1918, presumably before 
the Allied forces occupied Istanbul.  Berktay and others 
point to testimony in the 1919 Turkish Military Tribunals 
indicating that important documents had been \"stolen\" from 
the archives.  Berktay believes a second purge was executed 
in conjunction with Ozal\'s efforts to open the archives by a 
group of retired diplomats and generals led by former 
Ambassador Muharrem Nuri Birgi (Note: Nuri Birgi was 
previously Ambassador to London and NATO and Secretary 
General of the MFA).  Berktay claims that at the time he was 
combing the archives, Nuri Birgi met regularly with a mutual 
friend and at one point, referring to the Armenians, ruefully 
confessed that \"We really slaughtered them.\"  Tony Greenwood, 
the Director of the American Research Institute in Turkey, 
told poloff separately that when he was working in the 
Archives during that same period it was well known that a 
group of retired military officers had privileged access and 
spent months going through archival documents.  Another 
Turkish scholar who has researched Armenian issues claims 
that the ongoing cataloging process is used to purge the 
archives. 
 
Coming to Grips With History 
---------------------------- 
9. (sbu) Turkish attitudes on the genocide issue have evolved 
over time.  Although few have the courage to do so publicly, 
some intellectuals, academics, and others privately question 
the official version of events.  Ordinary citizens in central 
and eastern Anatolia often openly acknowledge to us what 
their grandfathers did to the Armenians.  Several visiting 
American academics have noted that the subject is no longer 
as taboo as it once was.  Publicly, the Turkish establishment 
(including the nationalist think-tank ASAM, the state Turkish 
Historical Association, and even the Archives) continues to 
challenge the assertions of the Armenian diaspora and fire 
off counter-accusations charging Armenians with having 
engaged in massive, wide-spread revolts during the war and 
with having perpetrated wholesale massacres on Turkish 
Muslims.  In recent years the Education Ministry has asked 
high-school students to compete in an essay competition to 
deny the genocide (note: Berktay claims that this idea 
originated with ASAM and was imposed on the Ministry by 
ASAM\'s military contacts).  The current government, however, 
has been noticeably more quiet on the subject than some of 
its predecessors, dutifully repeating the need to \"leave the 
issue for historians to discuss.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
10. (c) Although almost a century has passed since the 
1915-16 events, the gulf of misunderstanding between the 
Armenians and Turks on this issue remains considerable.  No 
longer as completely closed a subject as it once was, 
discussion of the issue in Turkey still remains limited and 
dominated by the nationalist/establishment line.  Even if the 
current government hopes to put this issue behind them, it is 
unlikely that they will be able to do more than simply 
encourage an environment in which a healthy discussion can 
take place.  It is doubtful that, in their current state, the 
Ottoman Archives will ever deliver a definitive 
interpretation of the Armenian question, but they will be a 
focal point and key resource for any Turks and Armenians 
seeking to engage in genuine research and debate on the 
issue.  To that end, we should support and encourage 
researchers to continue to push for access to the archival 
materials and be prepared to approach the Turkish government 
to discuss any complaints of official obstruction.  We 
request that the Department make us aware of any such 
complaints.

REF: JEDDAH 1603 
 
Classified By: Consul-General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
1. (C) Summary and Comment: Elected on June 16 as the next 
Organization of Islamic Conferences (OIC) Secretary General 
(reftel), Dr. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu met with poloff on July 12 
to discuss his recent election, plans for the organization, 
and views on a range of topics.  Well-known to the Consulate, 
Ihsanoglu will likely bring a more academic and less 
political approach to the OIC.  Ihsanoglu\'s experience and 
fluent English should make him an accessible and reasonable 
interlocutor, but his views on Israel/Palestine and U.S. 
policy in the Middle East will ensure that he is a firm 
advocate of long-held OIC positions on these and other 
issues.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
2. (SBU) Meeting with poloff on July 12, Dr. Ekmeleddin 
Ihsanoglu, the Director General of the Istanbul-based 
Research Center for Islamic History, Art, and Culture 
(IRCICA, a subsidiary of the OIC), credited both Turkish 
diplomacy and his own qualifications for his recent 
appointment as the next OIC Secretary General.  Following an 
initial impasse among three candidates (from Turkey, 
Malaysia, and Bangladesh) for the position (note: by 
tradition the position rotates between the Arab, African, and 
Asian groups within the OIC), Ihsanoglu was selected in the 
first-ever OIC \"election\" by 32 of the 56 voting members. 
Ihsanoglu told poloff that he sees this election, although 
the ballot was secret, as a particularly significant 
democratic development.  Asked whether it should be seen as a 
precedent or a one-time incident, Ihsanoglu said that as the 
presiding Secretary General for the next appointment he hopes 
to ensure that this practice is institutionalized. 
 
3. (C) Ihsanoglu remarked that the Istanbul OIC Meeting, like 
previous gatherings, was characterized by a consensus on the 
need for more democratic reform and civil society development 
among member states.  Several speakers underlined the \"image\" 
problem faced by the Islamic world in light of continuing 
terrorist activities.  Poloff suggested that these statements 
point to significant areas of common cause with the U.S. 
Broader Middle East and North Africa initiative.  Ihsanoglu 
seized on the opening to lambaste the U.S. for what he called 
a \"short-sighted, one-size-fits-all\" approach to the region. 
While conceding that the U.S. has a credibility problem, 
poloff assured Ihsanoglu that we are keenly aware of the 
regional diversity and do not intend to \"impose\" our own 
democratic model on the region.  Based only on the 
self-stated objectives of the OIC and its members, poloff 
reiterated that there should be substantial room for 
cooperation in this area. 
 
4. (C) Returning to the subject of U.S. credibility in the 
region, Ihsanoglu agreed that much of the public criticism 
directed against the U.S. was unwarranted.  Ihsanoglu 
conceded that U.S. interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, and 
Kosovo on behalf of local Muslim populations directly 
contradict charges of a U.S. \"anti-Islamic\" bias (Note: An 
expert on Bosnia, Ihsanoglu could not resist commenting that 
intervention had come late and that the Dayton Accords had 
created an unworkable situation for the Bosnian Muslims.  End 
Note).  Asked for his views on the ongoing crisis in Darfur, 
Sudan, Ihsanoglu openly dismissed OIC efforts and statements 
to date as inadequate and undertook to take a more aggressive 
approach on such humanitarian crises. 
 
5. (C) Ihsanoglu pointed to the Israel/Palestinian issue as 
the principal cause for the lack of U.S. credibility in the 
region.  Ihsanoglu remarked that as a teenager growing up in 
Cairo, despite official propaganda to the contrary, he 
remembered the U.S. as the \"land of the free\" and as an 
\"unbiased arbitrator.\"  This public image, he added ruefully, 
has been turned on its head over the last few decades. 
Ihsanoglu called on the U.S. to pressure Israel to abandon 
the \"illegal\" wall it is constructing, its settlements in the 
occupied territories, and its tactics of humiliation and 
violence.  Poloff argued that the U.S. is prepared to urge 
both sides to reach an agreement, but that any settlement 
will depend on the leadership and political will of the 
parties.  Ihsanoglu concurred when poloff noted that the 
absence of such leadership and any kind of democratic 
legitimacy on the Palestinian side are major obstacles to 
peace.  Ihsanoglu reminded poloff, however, that this issue 
led to the creation of the OIC and remains its \"raison 
d\'tre.\" 
 
6. (C) Ihsanoglu told poloff that the hiring of more capable 
and experienced staff would be his highest priority as OIC 
Secretary General when he assumes office next year.  Clearly 
 
SIPDIS 
dissatisfied with the caliber of the existing OIC staff, 
Ihsanoglu stressed the need for more \"capable\" personnel with 
\"international (i.e., U.N.) experience.\"  Although the four 
OIC Assistant Secretary Generals are appointed by the OIC 
members, Ihsanoglu believes that he will be in a position to 
make a positive difference at the middle and lower levels of 
the 150-strong OIC staff. 
 
7. (SBU) Bio Notes: 
 
Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, a Turkish national, was born in 1943 in 
Cairo, Egypt.  Before assuming his current position as the 
Director General of the Research Center for Islamic History, 
Art, and Culture (IRCICA) in 1980, Ihsanoglu was a professor 
of organic chemistry and has since continued his academic 
career as a professor of the history of science.  As the 
Director General of IRCICA and the Secretary of the 
International Commission for the Preservation of Islamic 
Cultural Heritage, Ihsanoglu has organized and directed 
research projects on various aspects of Islamic culture and 
civilization and has also edited a number of publications and 
periodicals.  He is fluent in Turkish, Arabic, and English 
and has a working knowledge of French and Persian.  He is 
married with three sons. 
 
Ihsanoglu has been a valuable Consulate contact for many 
years.  He is urbane, intellectual, friendly, and 
approachable.  While adept at developing and maintaining 
political contacts, Ihsanoglu\'s knowledge of foreign affairs 
and his personal manner and style are more academic than 
political.

SUBJECT: TURKISH TRUCKING ASSOCIATION URGES HALT TO WORK 
WITH USG IN IRAQ 
 
REF: ANKARA 4340 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
1. (sbu) Immediately following the August 2 murder of Murat 
Yuce, a former Turkish trucker who had been held hostage in 
Iraq, Turkey\'s largest transporters\' association released a 
statement calling on its members to halt work on all U.S. 
military contracts in Iraq.  The non-binding statement may 
have led to the subsequent August 5 release of two other 
Turkish truckers held hostage in Iraq, but also prompted 
criticism from such groups as a rival transporters\' 
association and Turkey\'s major exporters\' association, which 
argued that Turkish companies must be free to play a role in 
Iraq\' future.  Both transporters\' associations tell us 
privately, however, that, despite the risk, Turkish companies 
will continue to seek more business in Iraq.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Turkish Truckers Association \"Abandons\" USG Contracts 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
2. (sbu) Murat Yuce, a plumber employed by the Turkish firm 
Bilintur to handle laundry services at one of the U.S. 
military facilities in Iraq, was taken hostage and murdered 
on August 2 (reftel).  Until a few months ago, however, Yuce 
was a trucker for the Turkish firm Oztur.  Immediately 
following the internet broadcast of his murder, the 
International Transporters\' Association (ITA), which purports 
to represent over 90 percent of Turkish transportation 
companies, issued a statement calling on its members to halt 
work on all U.S. military contracts in Iraq.  (Note: 
Following the statement, two other Turkish drivers for Oztur 
were released in Iraq on August 5. End Note.)  Despite the 
declarative language of the statement (full text in para 7), 
ITA Chairman Cahit Soysal told poloff on August 5 that the 
decision was approved by only a majority of ITA\'s 19 board 
members and has no binding authority on ITA\'s 900 plus member 
companies.  Soysal began by assuring poloff that ITA does not 
see the U.S. as an \"enemy.\"  The August 2 statement, Soysal 
argued, is the product of many months of concern about the 
security situation for member employees in Iraq.  ITA said 
they have conveyed these concerns and specific suggestions to 
improve the situation to Turkish, Iraqi, and USG officials 
(including to Ambassador Bremmer during a February 2004 
meeting in Baghdad with a Turkish commercial delegation). 
 
3. (sbu) Poloff remarked that the U.S. shares ITA\'s concerns 
about the security situation.  Soysal conceded that the U.S. 
has taken some measures, but went on to argue that 
shortcomings in these arrangements vitiate their 
effectiveness.  Even where there are convoys, he said, they 
don\'t wait for trucks that have technical problems (even flat 
tires) and they speed up whenever they come under fire, 
sometimes leaving trucks behind.  Additionally, the convoys 
are provided only to Mosul and not back to the border -- 
would-be terrorists need only note which trucks are escorted 
on the way to Mosul and then target them on the way back. 
Soysal said that ITA does not hold the U.S. responsible for 
the security situation and added that ITA is willing to work 
with all of the relevant authorities to invest in measures 
that can improve the situation.  Additionally, Soysal assured 
poloff that ITA is not encouraging its member companies to 
cancel contracts with the U.S. military.  \"The statement was 
a political, public-relations message,\" Soysal admitted. 
Poloff noted that the USG is worried that the statement, by 
seeming to respond to terrorist demands, may ultimately have 
a detrimental effect on the personal security of Turks and 
other foreigners in Iraq.  Soysal said that, with sufficient 
cover (i.e., additional security measures), ITA would be 
eager to rescind the statement. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Rival Groups Denounce Statement as Irresponsible Posturing 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
4. (sbu) While the ITA statement elicited some public support 
(particularly from groups that are generally opposed to the 
U.S. presence in Iraq), a number of business associations 
were openly critical.  The Chairman of the Turkish Exporters\' 
Assembly, for example, said that \"Neither the Turkish 
truckers nor the exporters have the luxury to say that \'I 
don\'t want to play here.\'\"  Saffet Ulusoy, Chairman of ITA\'s 
principal rival transporters\' association, the Ro-Ro Vessel 
Operators and Combined Transporters\' Association (RODER), 
said that, \"ITA does not have the authority or the right to 
take such a decision.  Only the government can take such a 
decision.\"  Cumhur Atilgan, the General Manager of RODER 
(which claims to represent over 60 percent of Turkish 
transport companies) told poloff on August 6 that RODER also 
has security concerns but that many of its members had 
criticized the ITA statement as \"political posturing\" that is 
detrimental to their business and to the security of their 
truckers in Iraq.  (Note: Ulusoy, formerly ITA Chairman, 
formed RODER when he lost reelection 2 years ago.  ITA and 
RODER share a number of members, but do not see eye to eye on 
most issues.  End Note). 
 
--------------------------- 
Improving Security in Iraq? 
--------------------------- 
5. (sbu) Despite their security concerns and the perceived 
risks of working in Iraq, both ITA and RODER assured poloff 
that their members were committed to pursuing such business. 
Following the liberation of Iraq last year, trade between 
Turkey and Iraq has risen dramatically.  According to 
recently released figures from the Turkish Exporters\' 
Assembly, trade with Iraq in 2003 was over USD 1 billion and 
reached almost USD 800 million in the last 7 months.  In 
order to address their own security concerns, both ITA and 
RODER told poloff that they are developing projects to 
construct a warehouse and trans-shipment center in northern 
Iraq where Turkish trucks can transfer their cargo to Iraqi 
trucks.  Both said that they were willing to invest their own 
money, that they had already raised the idea with the Turkish 
MFA and Ministry of Transportation, and that they are 
planning to send delegations to Iraq to explore possibilities 
on the ground.  Both asked for U.S. support.  Both 
organizations also lamented the failure to implement earlier 
proposals that Turkish trucks be given fake or temporary 
Iraqi license plates to reduce the likelihood that they would 
be targeted by terrorists. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
6. (sbu) The ITA statement appears to have been a political 
effort to insulate Turkish truckers from association with the 
USG and to goad authorities into addressing their long-held 
security concerns.  Political and personal differences 
between ITA and RODER will probably prevent any cooperation 
between the two organizations on efforts to improve the 
security situation for their companies.  Regardless of the 
inherent risks and the position of their associations, 
however, Turkish transportation companies and exporters are 
likely to continue to pursue lucrative business contracts in 
Iraq. 
 
---------------------- 
ITA August 2 Statement 
---------------------- 
7. (u) International Transporter\'s Association supports the 
development of political and trade relations between Turkey 
and Iraq.  However, it has observed that security and 
stability in Iraq can not be maintained yet.  Within the 
framework of current developments, the ITA decided to stop 
the transport of cargo which belong to the American troops in 
Iraq as of August 2, 2004.

1. (sbu) Summary: Turkey\'s Istanbul-based minority religious 
communities report that while recent legislation has enabled 
them to \"legalize\" ownership of numerous properties already 
under their control, the new law is inadequate in that it 
does not permit the community foundations (mostly Greek 
Orthodox and Armenian) to reclaim properties that were seized 
by the state over the last 30 years.  In addition, community 
representatives note that they continue to face outright 
discrimination, in violation of the Lausanne Treaty, as their 
religious foundations must meet requirements not imposed on 
other foundations in order to acquire new properties.  While 
these institutions operated more freely during the Ottoman 
period, our contacts note that the problems they face today 
stem directly from a xenophobic, paranoid, \"deep-state\" 
mentality that continues to pervade the bureaucracy, courts, 
and military.  Interestingly, a decision taken by the Jewish 
community in the 1930s appears to have left it in a much 
better position than its counterparts.  End Summary. 
 
A Tough Place to Be a Religious Minority 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
2. (u) Legal problems aside, the most grave injustices 
committed against the minority communities are unlikely to 
ever be redressed.  The post-WWI population exchange between 
Greece and Turkey, the WWII wealth tax that forced many 
Greeks, Armenians, and Jews to sell their businesses and 
properties (and sent those who could not pay to labor camps), 
the 1955 anti-Greek riots that destroyed thousands of Greek 
businesses, and subsequent Greek-Turkish tensions in the 
1960s and 70s all created conditions in which members of the 
minority communities were forced to sell their properties at 
firesale prices or abandon them altogether.  This cable 
examines only those properties to which the minority 
community foundations have legal claims through acquisition 
(usually by donation) or prior ownership. 
 
Ottoman Era: Benign Neglect 
--------------------------- 
3. (u) The complex challenges faced by the communities stem, 
in part, from the historical context of the transition from 
the Ottoman Empire to the Turkish Republic.  During the 
Ottoman period, the minority religious communities had no 
\"foundations\" and ran themselves under their own laws 
concerning church or synagogue matters.  Their churches, 
synagogues, schools, monasteries, seminaries, and other 
properties either pre-dated the Ottoman Empire or were 
granted and authorized by the Sultan himself.  It wasn\'t 
until 1935 and 1936 that Turkey imposed rules and regulations 
on these institutions by defining them as \"foundations\" 
(although this confused them with the many thousand Muslim 
\"vakifs\" or foundations that operated under different rules), 
by placing them under the supervision of the General 
Directorate for Foundations (GDF), and by requiring them to 
submit declarations listing their extant properties. 
 
Modern Turkey: Regulate and Control 
----------------------------------- 
4. (u) In 1974 a Turkish high court decided that the minority 
religious foundations had no right to acquire property beyond 
those listed on their 1936 declarations, thus initiating a 
process that has continued almost to this day by which the 
state began to seize communal properties under various 
pretexts.  Such properties included those that had fallen 
into disuse, disrepair, or, according to the authorities, had 
insufficient \"documentation\" to establish firm legal 
ownership.  When the local population in specific areas fell 
below the statutory requirements, two Greek Orthodox 
foundations were taken into custody by the state in their 
entirety.  Almost all of the properties confiscated since 
1974 were rent-generating apartments and stores (not 
churches, synagogues, monasteries or other core communal 
institutions) that previously belonged to members of the 
community and had been bequeathed to the community 
foundations. 
 
On the Road to the EU: A New Era? 
--------------------------------- 
5. (c) As part of the 2002 EU Copenhagen criteria reforms, 
the Turkish parliament passed a law which in principle allows 
the minority religious communities to acquire, sell, and 
apply to register properties (ref A).  According to this 
initial reform, subsequent changes, and implementing 
regulations (refs B-E), minority foundations may indeed in 
principle acquire (either by purchase or donation) and sell 
properties, but only with the prior approval of the GDF. 
They may also apply to register properties under their 
control to which they do not already have clear legal 
ownership.  The laws do not permit them, however, to reclaim 
any of the properties acquired since 1936 that were 
expropriated following the 1974 court decision.  The Greek 
Orthodox and Armenian communities also both complain that 
these reforms do not address their other core concerns on 
obtaining recognition of legal personality for their 
Patriarchates, educating their clergy, and other issues. 
Huseyin Hatemi, an Istanbul University law professor and 
adviser to both communities, told poloff that the law does 
not turn the clock back to 1974 (when the communities freely 
acquired properties without special permission), much less to 
1935 (when they were almost totally unregulated). 
 
6. (c) Ata Sakmar, a Galatasaray University law professor and 
another adviser, agreed with Hatemi and noted to poloff that 
the root of the problem is a deeply frozen, xenophobic, 
paranoid, \"deep state\" mentality that stems from the events 
of World War I, the Treaty of Sevres, and what the Greeks 
refer to as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe.\"  Turkey only 
grudgingly accepted the 1923 Lausanne Treaty (guaranteeing 
freedoms and protections for non-Muslims) and ever since has 
tried, without any legal basis, to link its treatment of 
minorities with Greece\'s treatment of the Muslim population 
in Thrace.  Sakmar said this mentality is pervasive in the 
bureaucracy and even the courts.  In an ongoing expropriation 
case of the Greek Orthodox orphanage on Buyukada, for 
example, a civil court judge discarded the entire civil code 
and applied an irrelevant administrative code to reach a 
decision against the Patriarchate, something Sakmar likened 
to having a U.S. small claims court decide to impose an 
involuntary divorce on a plaintiff.  Sakmar said the same 
attitude was exhibited by the new interministerial commission 
tasked to resolve minority issues in their January meeting 
with the Ecumenical Patriarch (ref f). 
 
7. (c) Not all of the minorities are complaining, however. 
Silvio Ovadya, the newly appointed President of the Jewish 
Community, told poloff that they are pleased with the new 
reforms.  To date, they have won approval to purchase some 
land, to sell some properties, and to legalize their 
ownership of properties, including the Italian synagogue in 
Istanbul.  Founded for and used by non-Turks, the synagogue 
was deliberately excluded on the community\'s 1936 
declaration.  With the disappearance of that element of the 
community, however, Istanbul\'s remaining Jews have maintained 
the property.  Establishing ownership in a similar pending 
petition for properties in Izmir is more problematic and 
Ovadya did not seem to expect a positive response.  Unlike 
the Greek Orthodox and Armenians, however, the Jews have few 
property grievances.  When they were asked to list their 
properties in 1935-6, in what now seems to have been a 
prescient decision, they simply formed associations, 
transferred most rent-generating properties to the 
associations, and left them off the list. 
 
8. (c) Adnan Ertem, the Acting Director for the GDF in 
Istanbul and the senior official responsible for implementing 
the new laws, argued to poloff, however, that enormous 
strides had been made over the last two years.  He claimed 
that his office has rapidly and liberally implemented the new 
laws.  Although the regulations allow for a more narrow 
reading, Erdem asserts that his office has decided that even 
rent-generating properties will be deemed to meet the 
\"cultural and religious\" needs of the communities (presumably 
the rents will ultimately go to that purpose).  He asserts 
further that no application to acquire new property has yet 
been refused (Note: This was an early concern for the 
communities, ref g).  With regard to the almost 2000 
applications to legalize existing properties, Erdem claimed 
to have kept rigidly to the 2-month limit for considering 
such cases.  Roughly one-third have been approved, one-third 
sent back for more documentation (of those that have been 
resubmitted, Ertem claims that 90 percent have been 
approved), and one-third refused (on the grounds that they 
legally \"belong\" to third parties -- i.e., they were 
expropriated or are simply listed in the names of other 
individuals -- for the most part these were not under the 
control of the foundations and therefore ineligible for 
legalization under the new laws). 
 
9. (c) Asked about other problems encountered by the 
communities -- but not addressed in the new laws -- Ertem 
evinced an accommodating attitude.  He agreed, for example, 
that there is no need to restrict participation in elections 
for foundation boards to small geographic districts. 
Allowing anybody in Istanbul to participate, for example, 
would allow foundations in neighborhoods in which the 
community no longer resides to continue to operate (Note: 
Ertem suggested that we might want to raise this in Ankara 
where the foundation law is being rewritten).  Asked about 
the recent appropriation of the Greek Orthodox community\'s 
Buyukada orphanage, Ertem averred that solutions could have 
been found to keep the orphanage in the community\'s hands, 
but argued that the Patriarchate is more interested in 
preserving the original deed which is in its name (Note: 
Because Turkey does not recognize the Patriarch as a legal 
entity, the GDF challenged the deed and won a court ruling to 
expropriate the property).  Finally, Ertem disputed 
allegations that minority community foundations face 
discrimination, arguing that other foundations also require 
GDF approval to acquire and sell properties (in fact they 
require additional court approval to sell).  Ertem agreed 
that having two separate sets of laws is inappropriate and 
said that he hopes the new draft foundation law will apply 
equally to all foundations. 
 
10. (c) In an off-the-record postscript, Ertem told poloff 
that the Jewish and Armenian communities have good working 
relationships with his office.  The Greek Orthodox, however, 
never raise their problems with him, instead taking them 
directly to the Prime Minister, his cabinet, other countries, 
and even the European Court of Human Rights (Note: The 
Turkish press reported widely on August 10 that the ECHR had 
agreed to consider a petition by a Greek Orthodox foundation 
in Istanbul).  Ertem speculated that this may be because the 
Greek Orthodox community is primarily motivated by political, 
not administrative, concerns.  Specifically, the Patriarchate 
wants legal status for itself, something with which Ertem 
claimed to have no personal problem, but which can only come 
from being recognized by the Turkish government. 
 
11. (u) Neither the Greek Orthodox nor the Armenians ever saw 
the 2002 reforms as a solution to their problems and both 
continue to lobby government officials to address their 
concerns.  Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II met with FM Gul on 
July 16 and presented him with a letter detailing his 
community\'s grievances.  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, 
meanwhile, gave interviews this month to the BBC, Associated 
Press, and Reuters, in which he explained his problems. 
(Note: Bartholomew\'s interview with Reuters generated 
critical local press coverage when he was misquoted as 
calling on EU countries to \"pressure\" Turkey on these 
issues). 
 
Comment: The Real Problem 
------------------------- 
12. (c) Even the fiercest critics of Turkey\'s inability to 
resolve the problems of its minority religious communities 
admit that the AKP government seems determined to tackle the 
issue (an opinion expressed by both Hatemi and Sakmar, 
although Hatemi wondered whether FM Gul\'s appointment of 
notorious hardline nationalist Ambassador Bolukbasi-- who 
narrowly escaped assassination by the Armenian terrorist 
group ASALA years ago and whose nickname is Ambassador No -- 
to the interministerial commission was intended to sabotage 
the effort).  If Ertem is correct, the new laws on property 
are being implemented in a timely fashion.  The reforms 
adopted so far, however, have two fundamental flaws.  First, 
the laws do nothing to address the principal Greek Orthodox 
and Armenian grievances on property issues -- specifically, 
to allow them to reclaim properties that were seized since 
1974.  Second, the narrow reforms fail to address the wider 
political concerns of the communities. 
 
13. (c) The Armenian Patriarch, concerned about the long-term 
viability of the 60,000-plus member community, has focused 
primarily on his ability to find Armenian-capable teachers 
for their schools, train priests and reopen churches, and 
preserve the historical legacy of the community.  The 
Ecumenical Patriarch, with fewer than 3,000 Greek Orthodox 
left in Turkey, is more concerned with obtaining recognition 
of his Ecumenical status and reopening the Halki seminary to 
train new generations of clergy loyal to the Patriarchate. 
Both also seek a relaxation of strict rules on electing 
foundation board members and recognition of their \"legal 
personality\" as a means to securing their leadership 
positions in their respective communities. 
 
14. (c) Ertem\'s accommodating attitude notwithstanding, 
anecdotal evidence provided by our interlocutors and our 
personal observations of public reactions to minority issues 
support charges that the root of the problem lies in a 
xenophobic paranoia that pervades the bureaucracy.  As such, 
the problems that continue to afflict the communities\' are 
unlikely to be resolved with piecemeal reforms and countless 
ongoing appeals to the GDF and the courts.  Instead, it seems 
to us that a solution will only be possible when the Turkish 
government faces the fundamental issues head-on, takes a firm 
decision that these communities are an asset and not a threat 
to Turkey, and resolves to do whatever it takes to help them 
survive.

1.  (SBU) Summary: Industry participants in the July 23 
Istanbul voluntary principles meeting tell us that while they 
are \"interested in and supportive in principle\" of the 
initiative, it is unworkable unless Russian oil companies 
also participate.  They also stressed that while 
consideration of bypass pipeline issues is appropriate, it 
should not be the exclusive focus of the principles; rather, 
shipping regulations must also play a key role, since oil 
will continue to transit the Bosphorus.  All remain in close 
contact with MFA officials.  In our last meeting, with BP on 
August 26, we learned that a planned MFA meeting with Russian 
oil companies in advance of President Putin\'s state visit 
here early next month has fallen through, so that a planned 
follow-on meeting in Turkey towards the end of September is 
also now in doubt.  End Summary 
 
2. (SBU) The Istanbul meeting on the voluntary principles was 
attended by the Foreign Ministry, the UK Consulate, Nilufer 
Oral, head of the Maritime Policy Center at Bilgi University, 
and companies including British Petroleum, ENI, Shell, Total, 
Chevron-Texaco and ExxonMobil.  The UK was represented by 
Consul General Barbara Hay, who attended a luncheon for 
participants, but did not attend the meeting itself.  We 
subsequently canvassed officials from a number of 
participating companies, including BP Turkey President Tahir 
Uysal, Nilufer Comert, Managing Director for Shell, and 
Muammar Ekin, Managing Director of Total. 
 
3. (SBU) Uysal, who was accompanied by a senior advisor, 
Michael Bilbo, indicated that the good attendance at the 
meeting highlighted the fact that there is no \"disalignment\" 
within the industry.  All were impressed by Orel\'s opening 
presentation about the dangers posed by straits transit, and 
concurred that together with oil industry, Turkey has done 
\"all that it can do\" to minimize those dangers.  He 
characterized the MFA draft as a \"good document,\" and that 
Ministry officials had made clear they were there to work 
with the industry as they had no \"certain view\" and were 
instead groping for a solution to problems posed by the 
dramatic increase in oil shipments through the Bosphorus. 
Uysal noted that the proposal cuts across many issues and 
will affect many industry interests, and so will take time to 
absorb: BP itself is now thinking through the implications 
for CPC.  However, Uysal, like his colleagues at Total and 
Shell, said he had two principle initial caveats.  First, the 
initiative would be meaningless without the participation of 
Russian companies, which were not included on July 23, and, 
second, while the principles were directed towards 
encouraging use of pipelines, this could not be the exclusive 
goal, since oil shipments will remain on the straits whether 
or not a pipeline is built.  Shipping regulations must thus 
remain a key element.  BP also questioned the need for the 
principles to focus on assigning a cost to Bosphorus delays. 
Bilbo noted that the industry had already reviewed the 
situation last winter, and come to the conclusion that delays 
could cost the industry anywhere from 300-700 million USD per 
season (or from 50 cents to 3 USD per barrel),depending on 
weather, as a result of increased chartering rates, lost 
production, and lower prices offered on world markets for 
Russian oil. 
 
4. (SBU) Regarding next steps, Uysal noted that while the MFA 
hoped to present the principles to Russian industry before 
the Putin visit, that trip had now been put off, so that much 
will depend on the view President Putin takes in his meetings 
with Turkish officials.  As a result of the delay, a planned 
follow-on meeting with the industry here may also be 
postponed.  More generally, Uysal observed that there is a 
serious lack of communication between Turkish and Russian 
interests on the issue and the ways the two countries are 
impacted.  He noted that BP had recently taken a senior 
Russian oil executive to Ankara, and that the individual had 
returned with a whole new perspective both on Turkey\'s 
concerns about the straits and about what would need to be 
done to construct a pipeline. 
 
5. (SBU) Regarding the various pipeline proposals, Uysal 
stressed that a project could make economic sense, but would 
require a leader to push it forward.  BP, which played this 
role for BTC, would not do so for a second pipeline, but 
Transneft could conceivably do so.  Its decision to team up 
with the Anadolu Machinery Group on a possible Thracian bid 
had sparked interest throughout the Russian oil industry.  As 
for the Russian preference for the Thrace route, Uysal 
attributed it to lack of knowledge of Turkey.  While they saw 
it as the shortest route, environmental and right-of-way 
issues could make it much more complicated than the longer 
Samsun-Ceyhan alternative.  Uysal noted that BP\'s TNK 
affiliate has urged Transneft to back off Thrace.  Not 
surprisingly, Uysal saw BTC, \"the first Bosphorus bypass,\" as 
the easiest alternative for avoiding the straits.  Using a 
Heathrow analogy, he noted that proposals for a third London 
airport have continually been shelved in favor of expanding 
Heathrow.  Similarly, BTC capacity could be increased from 1 
to 1.4 million barrels per day with existing facilities, 
while additional pumping stations could expand capacity up to 
2 million barrels per day.  Beyond BTC, however, Uysal opined 
that the Samsun-Ceyhan route makes more sense, given existing 
right-of-ways (Bluestream to Kirikkale and then an existing 
Kirikkale-Ceyhan pipeline) and terminal facilities at the 
southern terminus. 
 
6. (SBU)  In closing, Uysal noted government concern about 
the agitation of the competing five pipeline groups for 
government licenses.  The Finance Ministry, he noted, sees 
the early granting of a license as a danger, in that it could 
do more to block a final decision than to facilitate it. 
Uysal opined that it might be best to give all five groups a 
license, thereby rendering them meaningless.  More critical 
will be creation of a sponsor group that will commit 
production to such a pipeline.  Companies will want 
substantial guarantees from Turkey that there will be no 
interruption in the pipeline before they step forward, in his 
view.  Surprisingly, Uysal opined that pipeline financing 
would \"not be a problem.\"  Rather, ensuring a proper legal 
structure could prove more difficult. 
 
7. (SBU)  Shell and Total officials largely echoed Uysal\'s 
point, but did so second-hand, since neither personally 
attended the session, as both companies were represented from 
the head offices in London and Paris respectively.  Both 
Comert and Ekin indicated that in recent days they had been 
in contact with Hakki Akil, Director of the MFA office 
pursuing the issue, and both had been provided by him with 
minutes of the July meeting.  Comert stressed that the July 
session was informal, and that the companies had only agreed 
in principle with the concerns that were reflected in the 
voluntary principles drafted by the Foreign Ministry.  They 
had not, however, made any explicit commitments to support 
them.  She noted that the issue is relatively less important 
to Shell than to companies like BP, since it has less oil 
flowing through the Bosphorus.  Shell will continue to 
participate in the process, however, and she noted that Hakki 
Akil from the MFA had phoned on August 20 regarding 
outstanding \"action items.\"  She noted that while the MFA 
planned a meeting on the issue with Russian companies before 
Putin\'s early September visit to Turkey, she expected that 
Russian companies would react negatively to the proposal. 
She added that in her view the principles as they stand are 
too commercially prescriptive, and should focus more on 
environmental and security issues. 
 
8. (SBU) Ekin and Altinyay noted that while Total is a 
relatively small player in Bosphorus shipping, its stake will 
increase as its Caspian projects come on line.  He stressed 
that Total feels a strong \"social responsibility\" to ensure 
safety of oil shipments, and suggested that the voluntary 
principles should be along the lines of things that already 
exist, including limits on ship age and double hull 
requirements.  Pipelines, he concurred, are a separate issue, 
involving commercial rather than security and environmental 
considerations.  He expressed doubt, however, about whether 
they would prove economical, unless Turkey made life \"more 
difficult\" for those using the Bosphorus, perhaps by raising 
insurance requirements.  Ekin noted that the big oil 
companies already implement most suggested measures for 
environmental and security protection, but concurred with a 
point that he said Chevron had raised on July 23 that such 
measures \"make things tougher and tougher for ourselves, and 
leave more room for smaller companies\" that may cut corners. 
 
9. (SBU) A Leader or a Stick: Ekin concluded that the process 
on the voluntary standards is a difficult one that requires 
either a leader or a stick.  The MFA is \"pushing a little,\" 
he said, but other countries will have to get on board too, a 
task made difficult in his view by the lower level of 
environmental safeguards and awareness in other Black Sea 
states. 
 
10. (SBU) Comment: From the vantage point of Istanbul 
industry, the MFA appears to have initiated a valuable 
dialogue, albeit one that they would like to see tweaked in a 
less commercial direction.  Whether the proposal will bear 
fruit, however, will depend on the stance of Russian 
interests, something that should become clearer in coming 
weeks with President Putin\'s visit to Turkey.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL ANALYSTS ON CURRENT ACCOUNT RISKS 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: Despite positive international and 
domestic developments, including the Turkish government\'s 
recognition of the need for a new stand-by agreement for the 
2005-2007 period, Turkish markets have remained range-bound 
in recent weeks.  Many analysts attribute the markets\' 
failure to rally to concern about the burgeoning Turkish 
current account deficit, which grew 95 percent year-on-year 
in the first six months of 2004 and at 9.9 billion for that 
period is now approaching 4 percent of GDP.  Most analysts 
doubt the deficit is near crisis levels; however, there is 
some difference of opinion on the severity of the problem, as 
can be seen by the contrasting positions rating agencies such 
as S and P, Fitch, Moody\'s, and JCR have taken.  Istanbul 
market observers we have canvassed in recent weeks agree that 
the high level of the current account is the largest cloud on 
Turkey\'s economic horizon, but largely concur with Fitch and 
S and P that it has not yet reached crisis proportions.  They 
argue instead that currently projected levels are 
financeable, and that the government\'s attention to the 
problem, while unlikely to be effective in and of itself, 
sent an important message to the markets that it was 
monitoring the issue, a point Economics Minister Babacan 
reiterated on August 25.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) A dramatic jump: January to June 2004 figures showed 
the current account gap at 9.9 billion USD, a 95 percent jump 
from the 5.09 billion USD deficit in the same period in 2003. 
 While exports have grown quickly, imports have expanded even 
more rapidly, leaving the trade deficit at 12.2 billion USD. 
(The trade deficit continued to worsen in July, when it 
reached 3.2 billion USD.)  Other negative items include 
investment, whose deficit was 2.8 billion USD for January to 
June.  On the positive side of the ledger, services (largely 
tourism) were in surplus at 3.5 billion, as were transfers 
(from Turks living abroad) at 1.6 billion.  As is typically 
the case in Turkey, tourism revenues are bunched in the third 
quarter, such that the full-year current account deficit may 
not be much higher than the first half number.  For the first 
half, Turkey financed the overall current account gap with 
net capital inflows of 9.4 billion USD and (given an increase 
in official fx reserves of 2.7 billion USD) 3.2 billion in 
net errors and omissions. 
 
3. (SBU) Financing Concern: Indeed, more than the absolute 
level of the deficit, the financing mix on which Turkey 
relies was of more concern to our interlocutors.  Global 
Securities\' Cem Akyurek, for instance, told us on August 19 
that he sees an encouraging trend towards repatriation of 
foreign capital by Turkish businesses in the net errors and 
omission total, but finds the overall composition of Turkey\'s 
capital inflows less inspiring, particularly the country\'s 
reliance on \"hot money,\" i.e. short-term portfolio 
investment.  Indeed, figures show that of the net inflow only 
1 billion USD came into Turkey as FDI from January to June. 
While this is a significant improvement on the abysmal FDI 
level of the first half of 2003, it falls far short of the 3 
billion in portfolio investment that came into Turkey in 
January-June.  The remainder of Turkey\'s capital inflow came 
from bank and non-bank borrowing, while government borrowing 
was negative because of net repayments to the IMF.  Bender 
analysts Murat Gulkan and Emin Ozturk concur that dependence 
on portfolio investment leaves Turkey vulnerable to sudden 
shifts in sentiment (the maxi-devaluation scenario which 
briefly spooked the markets when it was raised by a Moody\'s 
senior credit officer), but they also saw positive financial 
developments on the horizon that should help cover the gap. 
These include the recent agreement between the Cukorova Group 
and the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF), whereby the 
group will repay 4 billion USD over the next two years, 
almost exclusively from (admittedly mysterious) foreign 
sources, privatization or sale of big ticket items such as 
Tupras, Telsim, and Petkim (which should bring foreign 
interest), and prospects for a new stand-by agreement with 
the IMF. 
 
4. (SBU) Unavoidable Result: Analysts also reminded us that 
given the nature of the Turkish economy, with its dependence 
on imported capital equipment, an expanding deficit is an 
inevitable result of an economic recovery.  Akyurek argued 
that obviously a current account deficit of 5 percent of GDP 
would not be sustainable, but that similarly the economy 
could not grow with a deficit at its post crisis levels of 
1.5-2 percent of GDP.  Citibank Treasury Vice President Cem 
Koksal similarly viewed the deficit as a sign of the 
\"success\" of the government\'s economic program, and predicted 
that government measures would be successful in controlling 
it. 
 
5. (SBU) A Demand Explosion?: Though concern has been raised 
recently about the dramatic expansion in consumer loans and 
credit card debt, most analysts, like Deputy Prime Minister 
Sener, were reluctant to attribute the deficit to credit 
expansion.  Citibank noted that while they have increased, 
the absolute level of consumer loans is not that high, while 
Garanti Bank Vice President Kubilay Cinemre argued that 
automotive loans, one of the fastest growing items, simply 
represent the fulfillment of pent-up demand from the 
post-crisis period, and are rapidly reaching their limit. 
Similarly, Murat Ucer of Eurosource saw signs in July 
consumer data that consumption is starting to ease, while 
Global\'s Akyurek stressed that except for consumer durables, 
for which demand also accumulated in the post-crisis period, 
demand pressures are not excessive. 
 
6. (SBU) Government Policy: While some, particularly in the 
banking sector, are critical of the government\'s decision to 
increase the natural resources tax to dampen consumer 
lending, market analysts like Baturalp Candemir at HC 
Istanbul were impressed by the government\'s attention to the 
current account issue.  For the first time, he suggested, the 
government had taken action before a problem had hit the 
market.  On the other hand, the move is likely to complicate 
upcoming negotiations with the IMF.  IMF Deputy Resrep 
Christoph Klingen has told Embassy Ankara econoffs that the 
increase in the resource utilization tax had been taken in 
defiance of Fund staff, which opposed it as contrary to the 
GOT-agreed strategy of reducing bank intermediation costs. 
 
7. (SBU) More generally, however, there is broad consensus 
that current account pressures dictate that the government 
should maintain a tight fiscal policy for the foreseeable 
future, so most analysts in Istanbul are focused on the 
upcoming IMF-GOT negotiations.  Meeting the government\'s 
inflation target is likely to be tough next year, Akyurek 
suggested, and the government needs to maintain a high 
primary surplus to keep possible demand pressures under 
control.  Both he and Candemir did not see a 6.5 percent 
level as essential, but saw room for some give and take so 
long as the quality of fiscal adjustment is improved and its 
duration lengthened.  Hence a primary surplus of 6 percent 
could be acceptable to the market, as could exclusion of some 
investment items from the primary balance, so long as the 
government made clear its commitment to that level over a 
number of years.  Only such a commitment, Akyurek argued, 
would permit real interest rates to decline from their 
current 15 percent level.  While some are concerned that such 
rate declines could further fuel imports, Candemir pointed 
out that the rates\' current high levels themselves help fuel 
the current account deficit by encouraging short-term capital 
inflows that keep the Turkish lira overvalued.  Note: 
Istanbul analysts\' willingness to contemplate some loosening 
of the 6.5 percent primary surplus does not take into account 
the likely resistance from the IMF board to easing the GOT\'s 
contribution to the financing gap that the IMF is being asked 
to fill.  End Note. 
 
8. (SBU) GOT policymakers clearly remain attuned to the 
market\'s concerns about the current account deficit.  Both 
Economics Minister Babacan and Deputy Prime Minister Sener 
sought to emphasize the government\'s vigilant attention to 
the current account issue in public comments on August 25, 
with Babacan noting that the government will undertake 
further strong measures to control the deficit if necessary, 
while downplaying the seriousness of the problem in further 
comments on August 31.  For his part, Sener implicitly gave a 
green light to gradual devaluation of the Turkish lira, 
arguing that such a development would inevitably help resolve 
the problem by leading to a decline in imports and rise in 
exports.

1. (sbu) Summary: In addition to the struggle to maintain 
Istanbul as a viable seat for the Ecumenical Patriarchate, 
Bartholomew faces a rising challenge for moral and 
ecclesiastical authority within the Orthodox world from 
Moscow-based Russian Patriarch Alexy II.  End Summary. 
 
2. (sbu) Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the first among 
equals among Orthodox leaders worldwide, faces two challenges 
that, left unresolved, threaten the very future of this 
venerable, 1500-year old institution.  The first is the 
viability of Istanbul as a patriarchal seat.  The Patriarch 
traces his religious authority back to when Istanbul (then 
Constantinople) was the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire 
and Christianity was adopted as the state religion.  Today, 
however, the Patriarch\'s once-vibrant flock of millions of 
Greek Orthodox has fled (less than 3,000 remain) the 
trappings of its historical legacy, including the Hagia 
Sophia (the physical seat of the Patriarchate for almost a 
millennium but now a museum), and the Halki Seminary (where 
several generations of Orthodox priests were trained), and 
countless other properties have been expropriated or shut 
down.  Patriarchate officials tell us that unless they reopen 
the seminary, regain properties, and break free from the 
burden of Turkish regulations (particularly the requirement 
that the Patriarch be a Turkish citizen), the institution 
will die along with the last dozen or so of its surviving 
septuagenarian Metropolitans (see refs a-d and previous 
cables for reporting on these issues). 
 
3. (sbu) Even assuming that the Patriarch can secure the 
viability of its Istanbul seat, however, Bartholomew faces 
another major challenge from Moscow-based Russian Patriarch 
Alexy II for ecclesiastical authority in the wider Orthodox 
world.  Styling itself as the \"Third Rome,\" Moscow claims 
that it assumed authority within the Orthodox community 
beginning in the 15th century with the fall of 
Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire, and much of the 
Orthodox Balkans to the Ottoman Muslims and the subsequent 
elevation of Metropolitan Job of Moscow to the rank of 
Patriarch.  Although temporarily suspended by the Soviet 
regime\'s oppression of the Russian Orthodox Church for much 
of the 20th century, the Moscow church\'s efforts to extend 
its influence beyond its geographic jurisdiction have 
continued unabated.  With abundant sources of income among 
its vibrant community of over 100 million faithful, three 
seminaries in which to train new generations of clergy, and 
open political support from the Russian government, Alexy is 
well-placed to challenge Bartholomew on a number of fronts. 
 
Shot Across the Bow: Estonia 
---------------------------- 
4. (sbu) The first open dispute between Moscow and Istanbul 
in recent years was over Estonia, where 50,000 Orthodox 
Christians, mostly Russians, make their home.  Although the 
Estonian Church had placed itself under the jurisdiction of 
the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarch during its brief 
independence from Russia between 1923 and 1944, Moscow had 
since reasserted its control.  After regaining independence 
in 1991, at the request of Estonian Orthodox activists, and 
with the approval of the Estonian government, Bartholomew 
reasserted his jurisdiction over the Orthodox community and 
installed an Archbishop in 1996.  Alexy, who had previously 
served himself as the Metropolitan for Estonia during the 
later Soviet period, responded by temporarily severing formal 
ties, or in Church parlance, \"breaking communion\" with 
Bartholomew.  After months of negotiation, both sides agreed 
to allow the Estonians to choose for themselves (most 
parishes chose Bartholomew, but most of the Russian Orthodox 
population remains loyal to Moscow). 
 
Struggle for the Heartland: Ukraine 
----------------------------------- 
5. (sbu) Looming large in comparison to the skirmish for 
influence over Estonia is the impending struggle for the 
loyalty of 40 million Ukrainian Orthodox faithful in Ukraine, 
the original heartland of Eastern Slavic Orthodoxy. 
Ukrainian Orthodox Christians are currently divided.  The 
Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) 
has the most parishes, followed by the Ukrainian Orthodox 
Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP), and the Ukrainian 
Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC).  Poll sggest, 
howeer, tht most of the population islyal tothe smller 
UOC-KP.  (Note: In addition some 5 million Ukrainians 
identify themselves a members of the Ukrainian Eastern-Rite 
Catholic hurch, a church that is loyal to Pope John Paul II 
in Rome, but continues to maintain Orthodox tradiions (the 
existence of these churches remains a ajor source of 
friction between the Orthodox andCatholic Churches, see refs 
e-f)). 
 
6. (sbu)The UOC-KP and the UAOC have appealed to Bartholomw 
to help unite the fragmented Ukrainian Church ad help it 
obtain independence from Moscow.  Motivated by a combination 
of altruism and a desire to regain authority assumed by 
Moscow in the 17th century (but never recognized by 
Istanbul), Bartholomew has dispatched envoys to mediate 
between the various Churches.  Moscow, meanwhile, is 
reluctant to surrender its authority over a jurisdiction 
which includes as many as a quarter of its total parishes and 
has provided up to two-thirds of its clergy.  Bartholomew\'s 
point-man on this issue, Metropolitan Meliton of 
Philadelphia, the Secretary of the Holy Synod of the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate, told poloff that the negotiation 
process will likely take years, but that he hopes some 
formula can be found whereby a unified Ukrainian Church is 
granted autocephalous status under Istanbul, perhaps with an 
understanding that Moscow will select or vet the appointments 
of the senior-most clergy. 
 
Orthodox in Havana? 
------------------- 
7. (sbu) The most recent chapter in this ongoing rivalry took 
place far from Moscow and Istanbul earlier this year in 
Havana, Cuba.  In a deliberate snub to his former superpower 
patron, Fidel Castro offered to donate a church to the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate and invited Bartholomew to visit to 
celebrate the occasion.  Despite considerable pressure from 
the U.S. government (and this Consulate) to refuse the 
invitation, Bartholomew told us that his ongoing struggle 
with Alexy for influence in the Orthodox world compelled him 
to accept; if he refused, Castro would simply offer the 
Church to Alexy instead.  Despite the small size of the 
Orthodox community and the likely prospect that Castro would 
seek to manipulate the visit to his own advantage, 
Bartholomew visited in January, spent four days with Castro, 
and gladly accepted the new church (see ref g-h). 
 
Worldwide Battle for Hearts and Souls 
------------------------------------- 
8. (c) The Russian Patriarchate has not confined its 
ambitions to its immediate neighbors and one-time client 
states.  In a much more conciliatory fashion, Moscow has 
reached out to Orthodox communities in Western Europe, the 
United States, and, most recently, in Asia.  The Russian 
Orthodox Church has long had a presence in Western Europe, 
but has moved to open new churches and parishes throughout 
the region.  Last year, Alexy wrote to several Orthodox 
Bishops in Europe offering them more autonomy if they were to 
forsake Constantinople\'s authority for his own (ref i) and 
has opened new churches throughout Europe.  According to 
Metropolitan Meliton, Moscow\'s established dioceses in 
Austria, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, 
and the Netherlands are in direct violation of the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate\'s authority.  Metropolitan Meliton told poloff 
that he is also increasingly alarmed by similar moves into 
India, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia, and even the 
Seychelles.  The Patriarchate believes that these 
expansionary efforts have the full support of the Russian 
government.  As Bartholomew himself told the CG earlier this 
year, \"the Russians constantly pursue political ends through 
religion.\"  Meliton told poloff that he has heard reports 
that the Russian Foreign Ministry had concluded an agreement 
with Alexy to allow the Russian Orthodox Church to open 
chapels in its Embassies and Consulates around the world. 
Meliton even expects Russian President Putin, who postponed 
an official trip to Turkey earlier this month, to petition 
the Turkish government for permission to open one or more of 
their own churches under the very nose of the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate (Note: Currently, Bartholomew permits Russian 
priests to perform services in churches under his control, 
but the Russians have long sought their own churches). 
 
Comment 
------- 
9. (sbu) Although these venerable religious institutions are 
primarily engaged in providing spiritual services and 
guidance to millions of devoted followers, much of their 
institutional tension and international rivalries center on 
more mundane issues, such as possession of churches and 
control of territory.  As recently as mid-August, 
Metropolitan Meliton and Metropolitan Demetrios of America 
traveled to Jerusalem in n ffot o rsolve a dispute over 
control of soe arihe inCaifonia.  The fact that the 
Patriarchate spends considerable time on such issues is an 
indication that t clearly sees its very survival as 
depending ona successful defense of its canonical privileges 
and moral authority in the Orthodox world. 
 
10 (c) This rivalry may also have unfortunate implicaions 
for the Patriarchate\'s continuing efforts t secure its 
status here in Istanbul.  Erol Muterimler, an influential 
academic, suggested to us ecently that resistance among the 
Turkish militay and bureaucracy to acknowledging the 
Patriarch\' ecumenical status nd eopening the Halki 
seminry ay ste from  desir to move closer to Russiaand 
aoid an involement in what they see as a roxy rivalry 
between Washington and Moscow.  A psitive Turkish response 
to a Putin request for Rusian churches to be opened in 
Turkey (see para 7 might be an indication that such thinking 
has sme currency in Ankara.

SUBJECT: A MARINER\'S VIEW OF THE TURKISH STRAITS 
 
REF: ISTANBUL 262 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
1. (U)  In meetings with Consulate and Embassy officers last 
week, British Petroleum maritime consultant Vice Admiral Sir 
Christopher Morgan provided a mariner\'s view of the issues 
the Turkish straits pose for transiting oil tankers.  Morgan, 
who accompanied a BP Suezmax tanker through the straits at 
the height of last winter\'s storms, spoke highly of the newly 
installed Vessel Traffic System (VTS) and sees few risks in 
the actual transit of either the Dardanelles or the 
Bosphorus, provided that there is no oncoming traffic on the 
latter.  Rather, he argues that the key safety issue centers 
on the anchorages at the entrances to the Dardanelles, 
particularly at the northern end where loaded tankers can 
back up.  At one point during his transit, nearly 60 loaded 
tankers were jostling for position in a narrow anchorage. 
During the fierce storms that buffeted the area at the end of 
January, several of these ships dragged anchor and nearly 
collided with their neighbors.  In Morgan\'s view, this 
anchorage policy \"is more risky than the combined risk of 
each and every individual tanker transit through the Turkish 
Straits.\"  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Vice Admiral Morgan, accompanied by Mike Bilbo from 
BP\'s Istanbul office, met with us on September 16 to discuss 
his experience transiting the straits at the height of last 
winter\'s storms.  He accompanied a BP chartered Suezmax 
tanker, the MT Max Jacob, which loaded at the Georgian port 
of Supsa on January 10 and then proceeded west across the 
Black Sea towards the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, entering the 
northern strait on January 15.  Morgan, who recently retired 
after five years as Director General of Britain\'s Chamber of 
Shipping, prepared a report on his experience in March that 
assessed the risks the Turkish straits pose for transiting 
ships and the operations of Turkey\'s Vessel Traffic 
Management system and other maritime safety measures.  Aside 
from one unfortunate incident, and a number of technical 
critiques, including the need for pilots to join the ship 
before they are actually committed to entering the straits 
and the relative inadequacy of the tugs used by Turkish 
coastal authorities, he was largely complimentary of the 
professionalism and knowledge of the Turkish maritime 
authorities with whom he worked.  In particular, he had high 
praise for the new VTS, saying it provided ship captains with 
useful, accurate information. 
 
3. (SBU) Anchorage Risks: Morgan\'s major safety concerns 
centered on the risks posed by the \"cramming\" of large 
numbers of tankers into inadequate anchorages as backups 
built up during this winter\'s storms.  By chance, he found 
himself at the Gelibolu anchorage at the northern end of the 
Dardanelles at the very height of this winter\'s delays, when 
average waits reached nearly 30 days and 66 ships were 
waiting to transit, both northbound and southbound.  The MT 
Max Jacob reached Gelibolu on January 17, after an uneventful 
run through the Bosphorus, a transit that Morgan describes as 
posing \"few problems for a well run Suezmax,\" provided that 
(as Turkish regulations require) there is no oncoming 
traffic.  The voyage swiftly became more arduous, however, as 
at Gelibolu the ship joined a queue of vessels containing 
some 26 million barrels of crude oil that were waiting to 
transit the Dardanelles. 
 
4. (SBU) Morgan characterized the most stressful period of 
the voyage as the time when the ship was maneuvering among 
these anchored vessels to find its own mooring area.  The 
ship was subsequently stuck for ten days in the anchorage by 
fierce winter storms with winds of over 50 knots that ravaged 
the area, and led to closure of the straits.  During that 
period, several ships dragged anchor and came within little 
more than a ship\'s length of their neighbors before being 
able to get underway.  Morgan noted that in meetings with 
government officials in Ankara he will argue that a new 
designated anchorage south of the separation zone is urgently 
needed at Gelibolu to ease this congestion.  In addition, 
given the dangers the anchorages pose, he argued that Turkey 
should reduce the vessel buildup by more efficiently using 
daylight hours in good weather and by easing its \"excessive\" 
requirement of an hour and a half separation between tankers 
during their transit.  An hour, he suggested, would be 
sufficient, though he noted that this is an argument that the 
industry does not expect to win.  More likely to win official 
sanction, he added, is a recommendation that when traffic 
builds up the straits operate in one direction for an entire 
day, rather than half a day.  The latter procedure costs 
several hours from the shortened winter day, as ships wait 
for vessels moving in the opposite direction to clear the 
channel. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: Given his relationship with the industry, 
Morgan\'s recommendation that transit separation spacing be 
reduced so that more vessels can make the passage in a day is 
not surprising.  However, his point about the risks posed by 
the anchorages seems difficult to refute, and is dramatically 
illustrated by radar printouts from January which depict 
dozens of ships, many nearly on top of each other.  Morgan 
indicated he will push the anchorage issue in particular in 
his meetings in Ankara.  Given Turkish concerns about 
straits\' safety and congestion, he does not expect his 
argument regarding separation times to win much traction. 
Suggestions by the press and some observers that the GOT may 
be excessively regulating traffic to purposefully delay 
shipping to further make the point on congestion show that 
this could induce a dangerous outcome.  End Comment.

1. (SBU)  Summary: Representatives of Turkey\'s two leading 
transporters associations told us in meetings this week that 
their members perceive a deteriorating security situation in 
Iraq, with problems now reaching as far as Mosul in the 
north.  They also continue to see serious problems with the 
convoy system.  While they are working to explore how 
insurance, secure rest stops, and private security firms can 
ease the difficulties faced by their members, they do not see 
these possibilities providing any short term relief.  Despite 
the problems, they indicated that Turkish companies remain 
committed to supply operations, and that the associations 
continue to explore ways they can help.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) P/E Chief met separately with the leaders of 
Turkey\'s International Transporters\' Association (UND), 
Chairman Cahit Soysal and Vice Chairman Reha Uran, and Ro-Ro 
Transport Association (Roder) Chairman Cumhur Atilgan.  We 
offer a synopsis of their comments in order to provide some 
additional on-the-ground information about this often 
confusing subject. 
 
3.  (SBU) Convoys:  Both organizations reported that their 
members continue to express concern about the way in which 
convoys for humanitarian and military cargoes are organized. 
Their reports indicate that rarely is the goal of one escort 
per ten vehicles achieved.  Instead, their members complain 
that often one hundred trucks are grouped together with only 
two escorts, causing a \"loss of control.\"  (Note: We believe 
they are referring not to fuel shipments for the coalition-- 
which we understand receive coalition escort on the basis of 
a 1:10 ration-- but to humanitarian fuel shipments for whom 
private security contractors are responsible.  End Note.) 
They stressed that they would like to see smaller (20 vehicle 
convoys) occur in practice.  In addition, members continue to 
report that they \"never see return escorts.\"  Terrorists, 
they added, know this fact, and continue to focus their 
attacks on the return trip.  UND officials conceded that in 
some cases truck drivers may head off on their own to buy 
oil, and so drop out of the convoy system for that reason, 
but they argued that the reports are so unanimous that this 
cannot be the only factor.  A final concern centers on the 
way in which formalities are completed at the convoy\'s 
destination.  Soysal noted that trucks have to wait on the 
road outside secure areas for the paperwork to be completed, 
leaving all vehicles, but especially those at the end of the 
convoy, vulnerable to attack.  Truckers would prefer that the 
trucks be admitted to the base and that formalities be 
finalized there.  (Note: Turkish contruction company and USG 
contractor Yuksel executive Emin Sazak raised a similar point 
in meetings in Ankara, noting that terrorist surveillance and 
threats often occur at this final stage of the delivery.) 
 
4. (SBU) Insurance: UND noted ref A\'s point regarding the 
inclusion of an insurance/security premium in coalition and 
humanitarian delivery contracts.  They responded, however, 
that this is ineffective, as adequate insurance coverage is 
rarely available, and when it is (allegedly only one Turkish 
company will write such coverage) it is prohibitively 
expensive.  The expense, they suggested, far exceeds what is 
provided for this purpose in the contracts, and thereby eats 
into the trucker\'s profit margin.  If the convoy system were 
more effective, they added, insurance rates might fall. 
(Note: This insurance problem is separate from the at least 
equally difficult insurance issue raised by MFA (and echoed 
by the associations): that truckers are unable to document 
their insurance claims for damage or theft since U.S. 
military and local police do not issue the equivalent of a 
police report.  End Note.) 
 
5. (SBU) Secure Rest Areas/Transshipment Centers: RODER chief 
Atilgan noted that progress is being made on a transshipment 
point near Zaho, which will offer Turkish truckers the option 
of transferring their deliveries to local Iraqi drivers. 
This will enhance security for Turkish drivers, though at the 
cost of their income, since it is less lucrative to drop off 
goods in the North than to carry them to their final 
destination.  UND concurred, and stressed that their goal is 
safe transport all the way to Baghdad-- they do not what to 
have to transship their goods, given both the drop in income 
and legal issues that result concerning who retains 
responsibility for the cargo.  Regarding secure rest areas, 
Soysal noted that this is an attractive idea, but that it is 
difficult to move it forward given the lack of authoritative 
interlocutors in Iraq.  \"It is unclear who we can deal with 
on this,\" he stressed. 
 
6. (SBU) Security: Both organizations reported a 
deteriorating security situation, with problems now reaching 
as far north as Mosul.  If the problems reach the border, 
Atilgan said, \"you will no longer see any Turkish truckers in 
Iraq.\"  UND noted that there is some question about whether 
all of the attacks are the work of insurgents, or whether 
some stem from local operators who would like to see more 
goods be transshipped.  Both concurred that use of private 
security companies is an option for Turkish truckers, and UND 
noted that they put information about available companies on 
their website (without explicit recommendation of particular 
firms).  However, the expense again cuts into operating 
margins, and means that few companies take advantage of this 
possibility. 
 
7. (SBU) Other issues: Neither organization saw the Syrian 
route (suggested by some GOT officials last week), as an 
alternative solution.  They noted that it involves additional 
risks, including high charges and further bureaucratic 
difficulties.  (Note: In contrast to MFA officials, senior 
Turkish Customs officials have told the Embassy that the 
Syrian route is impractical for truckers.  End Note.)  RODER 
noted that problems are now extending further north, into the 
Mosul area, which is of serious concern.  UND also complained 
about the activities of Northern Iraqi authorities, who it 
alleged are acting \"like they run an independent state.\"  The 
latest step that has sparked outrage is the requirement that 
Turkish truckers buy fuel from designated stations in Iraq, 
and the levying of fines (240 USD per truck) for vehicles 
that have more than a \"minimal amount\" of fuel in their tanks 
on entering Iraq. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: The RODER and UND comments were a sobering 
indication of what Turkish drivers face in Iraq.  Both 
organizations remain committed to helping their members cope 
with the difficulties that exist (even as UND continues to 
recommend that companies not carry coalition cargo-- a 
recommendation that Soysal said the organization is not yet 
in a position to lift).  They indicated that Turkish 
companies remain committed to supply operations, as reflected 
by the 8000 to 10,000 Turkish trucks that are on the road on 
a daily basis in Iraq, but that the rising risks and expense 
could lessen that commitment.  As a reminder of the threats 
and pressure faced by Turkish drivers, on October 1 Soysal 
faxed a copy of a document distributed to drivers in Iraq 
signed by a Ebi Basir and Ebi Jandel Teams, threatening any 
driver who delivers fuel to Iraq after September 30 with 
death.  End Comment. 
 
Baghdad Minimize Considered.

SUBJECT: CUKUROVA FAILS TO COME THROUGH AGAIN 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
This cable was coordinated with Embassy Ankara. 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: Turkey\'s stock market was shaken Tuesday 
as it absorbed news that the Cukurova Group had again missed 
the deadline for completion of the first payment under its 
early payment plan with the Turkish Savings Deposit Fund 
(SDIF).  The ISE-100 dropped 2.15 percent Tuesday as a 
result, with Yapi Kredi Bank, which was slated to receive the 
bulk of the 130 million USD payment, falling 9.5 percent 
before trading in its shares was suspended.  The apparent 
failure of the high profile deal not only complicates the 
future of Yapi Kredi Bank, which is owed 2 billion USD by the 
group, but also that of Turkey\'s largest GSM operator, 
Turkcell, whose shares are held in trust by the bank as 
collateral for the loan.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Early Repayment: Pursuant to an early repayment 
agreement concluded in July between the Cukurova group, 
Banking Regulatory Board (BRSA), the SDIF, and Yapi Kredi 
Bank,  the group received a \"haircut\" of nearly 2 billion USD 
in its outstanding debt to the bank and the SDIF (the latter 
debt stems largely from the failure of Pamukbank, which the 
group also owned) by shortening the repayment period from 
2011 to 2006.  From the outset much speculation surrounded 
the identity of the mysterious foreign investors who were 
providing the capital that would enable the Cukurova Group to 
meet its 4 billion USD in outstanding obligations, with press 
speculation earlier this month focusing on Central Asian and 
other unspecified middlemen.  Officially, the source of the 
funds was the Northway Petroleum Corporation, an apparent 
paper entity whose General Manager was added to the Turkcell 
and Yapi Kredi boards earlier this fall. 
 
3. (SBU) Jewel in the Crown: For Cukurova, the key enticement 
to the deal was the ability to hold onto the 13 percent of 
Turkcell shares that the bank holds in trust against the 
group\'s outstanding debts.  Under its original payment 
protocol, the group can only hold onto the shares by paying 1 
billion USD in cash by the end of January 2005.  The new 
protocol lengthened the deadline and provided for gradual 
release of shares as Cukurova made its debt payments.  The 
company, which once made Mehmet Karamehmet(who controls 
Cukurova) the wealthiest man in Turkey, is the group\'s 
centerpiece, and with a leading position in Turkey and 
growing interests throughout the region (including its recent 
success in a GSM license tender in Iran, albeit one now 
subject to review by the Iranian parliament), Turkcell 
appears poised to maintain its market dominance and continue 
to grow its overall valuation. 
 
4. (SBU) Missed Deadline: Despite the doubts about the fund 
providers, most brokerages hailed the deal this summer.  One 
typical comment, from HC Istanbul, characterized the outcome 
as \"positive for all the parties directly involved.\"  Given 
Cukurova\'s previously spotty record in loan repayment, 
however, this endorsement came with the important caveat that 
confidence in the plan would \"gradually increase once 
investors see a couple of regular monthly payments by 
Cukurova.\"  To date, however, no payments have been 
registered.  Instead, the payment deadline was first moved 
from early September to late September, and ultimately to 
October 11.  The Group briefly claimed on October 11 that it 
had made the necessary payment in the United States, but that 
the Columbus Day holiday had prevented transfer of funds to 
Turkey.  That claim swiftly disappeared, however, as the 
group proved unable to produce a deposit receipt and as the 
funds failed to appear again on October 12. 
 
5. (SBU) Next Steps: Still unclear is what the next step in 
the process will be.  The SDIF, which has less at stake, has 
indicated that Cukurova can combine the first and second 
payment, together with interest, and maintain the revised 
protocol.  Both Yapi Kredi Bank and the BRSA, however, have 
said that failure to produce the money on October 12 rendered 
the revised protocol null and void.  Most critically for 
Cukurova, that would enable Yapi Kredi to sell the Turkcell 
shares it holds as early as the end of January.  Already a 
number of companies have expressed interest, including 
Telia-Sonera, the company\'s minority Finnish partner, which 
could assume majority control of the company by buying the 
pledged shares. 
 
6. (SBU) What Went Wrong: Cukurova Chairman Karamehmet is 
notoriously tightlipped, but already there is speculation 
that the group\'s unidentified fund providers balked at 
contributing once they realized that the collateral they had 
been promised fell short of the amount they were being asked 
to provide.  As evidence, some note that the fund providers 
had asked that bank shares be provided to them as collateral 
as well, something explicitly prohibited by the early 
repayment agreement, since their eligibility to run a bank in 
Turkey was open to question.  In a statement late Thursday, 
Cukurova claimed that the delay in payment was entirely the 
fault of its lenders, as though this somehow absolved it of 
responsibility. 
 
7. (SBU) Yapi Kredi Still Healthy:  Both the Chief Sworn 
Auditor (bank inspector) of BRSA and Yapi Kredi executives 
told econoffs that, despite the market concerns, Yapi Kredi 
is still a sound institution.  One YKB executive told us the 
Turkcell shares held by YKB have appreciated in value from 
$1.5 billion to $7-8 billion over the past 2.5 years. 
Moreover, he opined that some groups such as Koc, Sabanci or 
Telia Sonera would be very interested in paying a substantial 
premium for these shares.  The Sworn Auditor said YKB is 
adequately capitalized and has a good image.  A second YKB 
executive worried about the effect of the uncertainty could 
have on YKB\'s image, a concern similar to that voiced by BRSA 
Chairman Bilgin in a meeting this summer. 
 
8. (SBU) How the Cukurova-Yapi Kredi end game plays out is 
important for several reasons.  First and foremost, as BRSA 
Chairman Bilgin has told us privately, Yapi Kredi is one of 
Turkey\'s major banks, and problems at Yapi Kredi have 
implications for the entire banking sector.  YKB executives 
have told us that BRSA stays in close, solicitous touch with 
YKB management.  This case is also important for the 
credibility of the relatively new leadership of BRSA and 
SDIF.  Cukurova is only one of the owners of failed banks 
that the regulators--backed by the GOT--have been pressuring 
into finalizing deals to honor intervened banks\' loans to 
these owners\' other companies.  But Cukurova is the most 
important of the remaining cases because of the large amounts 
involved and Yapi Kredi\'s size and importance.  If SDIF and 
BRSA are perceived as insufficiently tough on Cukurova, this 
could hamper the regulators\' ability to enforce other deals 
with failed bank owners.  Finally, the Cukurova arrangement 
raises questions about the source of the funds the group is 
bringing in to make its payments.  Though markets and even 
regulators seem to be mainly focused on whether Cukurova can 
come up with the money, if the source of the funding is not 
clear, it would raise doubts about possible tax evasion or 
money laundering.  End Comment.

2. (SBU) Bombing and Follow-up: As reported in reftel, 
shortly after midnight on October 7 an unidentified assailant 
threw an explosive device (identified as a hand grenade by 
police after subsequent discovery of a pin) over the back 
wall of the Ecumenical Patriarchate compound.  The device 
exploded near the roof of St. George Church, shattering 
several windows in the upper clerestory, as well as the 
window of one apartment in the Patriarchal residential 
building facing the church.  There were no injuries.  On 
October 13, Istanbul RSO met with Chancellor Theoliptos to 
review developments and provide security advice.  The 
chancellor indicated that he is \"generally satisfied\" with 
police department response and cooperation.  He noted that he 
spoke with Istanbul Police Chief Celalettin Cerrah about 
security subsequent to the attack, and that the chief had 
undertaken to send someone from the Turkish National Police 
to visit the Patriarchate and make security recommendations. 
(Note: In a subsequent phone conversation, Cerrah\'s deputy, 
the Police Chief for Fener, confirmed that he will send 
someone to review security issues.  We will follow up this 
week to ensure that this occurs.  End Note.) 
 
3. (SBU) Upgrades: Theoliptos noted that he plans security 
upgrades, including a new perimeter security camera system, a 
new metal detector, and installation of new fencing that will 
make it more difficult to throw material over the wall.  RSO 
also recommended installation of shatter resistant window 
film, creation of safehavens, and solicitation of police 
support for patrolling of the back wall of the Patriarchate, 
which has been the location of most incidents.  (Note: 
Currently there is a permanent police presence at the front 
of the compound, but not at the rear.  In addition, the TNP 
provides a three-man personal protection detail to the 
Patriarch.  End Note.) 
 
4. (SBU) Halki Controversy: On an unrelated subject, 
Patriarchate officials, including His All Holiness himself, 
continue to express concern about a press controversy which 
briefly flared at the beginning of October regarding 
allegations that the U.S. Defense Department provided the 
Patriarchate with 12 million USD to \"bribe\" Turkish officials 
to facilitate the reopening of Halki Seminary.  The 
allegation, made in documents submitted to the 6th District 
Court in Kadikoy by Vasilaki Filoridi, who is suing the 
Patriarchate for alleged misuse of 3.3 million USD that he 
contributed, received wide press coverage in early October 
(albeit mostly in more marginal, nationalist papers).  The 
Patriarchate convoked the Consulate on October 6 to request 
an official USG statement denying the allegation.  We 
understand that such a message is being cleared on an 
inter-agency basis in Washington.  The Patriarch himself made 
an oblique reference to the issue in his October 10 meeting 
with a delegation from the American Jewish Committee. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: The recent spate of security incidents 
surrounding the Patriarchate, coming after several years of 
relative quiet, are a matter for concern.  Turkey\'s progress 
towards the European Union, and understanding of the sorts of 
changes that this will require, appears to have inflamed the 
sentiments of a small core group of extreme nationalists, 
leading not just to the recent terrorist incident, but also 
to a public campaign against reopening of Halki.  We will 
continue to closely monitor the situation, and provide advice 
as appropriate, and have encouraged the Patriarchate to 
immediately inform us of further, similar developments.  End 
Comment.

LINGERING SENSITIVITIES 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: Sessions at last week\'s Istanbul 
conference of Europe\'s Green Party highlighted Turkey\'s hopes 
and aspirations to gain a date for the beginning of accession 
negotiations, but also lingering sensitivities about 
perceived EU discrimination against Turkey and local 
discomfort about the changes EU negotiations and membership 
will bring in its wake.  The centerpiece of the conference 
was a joint appearance by German Foreign Minister Fischer, 
Turkish Foreign Minister Gul and incoming Enlargement 
Commissioner Rehn, where the two sides laid out their 
positions, with Gul pressing for easing of the negotiating 
conditions and Fischer arguing that they represented a 
sensible middle ground that enables both sides to keep their 
\"eye on the goal.\"  More heated and revealing was a debate on 
Islam (which included an Alevi representative) and a 
philosophical discussion on Turkey\'s EU prospects that 
featured noted novelists Yasar Kemal and Orhan Pamuk, and 
singer (and opposition deputy) Zulfi Livaneli.  Environmental 
and human rights panels also attracted extensive interest. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The October 19-21 Istanbul meeting of the European 
Parliament\'s Green/EFA Group was designed to facilitate an 
\"open and constructive\" discussion about EU and Turkish 
mutual expectations.  With participation from a broad 
cross-section of representatives from the Turkish political 
world and civil society, the conference exposed a number of 
the fault lines both between the two sides and within Turkey 
itself.  Designed as a pluralist forum, with representation 
by all viewpoints, it quickly encountered criticism from some 
for failing to include an adequate \"Kemalist\" representation. 
 Opposition gadfly Bedri Kadri charged that the inclusion of 
only like-minded \"second republicans\" and \"liberal-Islamists\" 
shortchanged the Kemalists, which he optimistically 
(over)estimated as 60-70 percent of Turkish \"intellectuals.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Equal Treatment: On whether Turkey is being treated 
differently, Green representatives were unapologetic.  Group 
President Daniel Cohn-Bendit argued that Turkey should 
actively seek \"special\" rather than \"equal\" treatment, since 
its integration is not comparable to that of such countries 
as Malta and Bulgaria.  \"It will be difficult (for both),\" he 
argued, \"but one of the most important steps we must both 
take.\"  While FM Gul echoed the government\'s standard 
insistence on equality of treatment, Prime Minister Erdogan\'s 
close advisor Cuneyt Zapsu picked up on Bendit\'s suggestion. 
\"We are not being treated like others, because we are 
different,\" he argued, and \"I am proud\" of that fact.  Given 
Turkey\'s size and importance, he continued, \"It is naive to 
expect equal treatment.\" 
 
4. (SBU) A Balancing Act: Both Commissioner Rehn and FM 
Fischer emphasized that the Commission recommendation sets an 
\"end goal of full membership,\" adding that the special 
conditions imposed were not in any sense \"harsh and 
punitive,\" but rather intended to \"recognize the 
difficulties\" in Turkey\'s accession.  It is not against 
Turkey or a sign of skepticism, Fischer insisted, but a \"work 
of art\" designed to open the road and give Europe time to 
modernize its structures and prepare itself for Turkish 
accession.  In the future, Fischer optimistically predicted, 
\"People will change and laugh that they once wanted to say no 
to Turkey.\"  For his part, however, FM Gul did not back down 
from Turkey\'s desire to see changes from the Commission\'s 
report, arguing that mutual trust must be deepened and 
consolidated and that Turkey\'s membership should not be a 
\"subject of internal politics (in European countries).\" 
 
5. (SBU) Historical Taboos: While the ministers reiterated 
basic positions, others directly broached local taboos and 
held up a mirror to challenge the EU to look more closely at 
itself.  Noted writer Orhan Pamuk, in particular, hit a chord 
with some in the audience (and antagonized others) by 
stressing that the new and freer Turkey must now face up to 
questions about its past, particularly the \"disappearance\" of 
Armenians and Greeks in the early part of the last century, 
arguing that a culture where such issues can be discussed 
will be one that Europe will find easier to accept. 
Singer/writer/director (and Republican People\'s Party-- the 
party of Ataturk-- deputy) Zulfu Livaneli challenged the 
notion of Ataturk\'s supremacy by noting the contributions of 
a long line of reformers who preceded him.  EU 
Parliamentarian Cem Ozdemir even suggested that Ataturk must 
be saved from some of his admirers who sought to use him as 
an \"excuse to stop freedom.\"  \"Where,\" he asked rhetorically, 
\"is the modernization of Turkish education?\" 
 
6. (SBU) Religion and Identity: In a panel on Islam, after 
criticizing the Turkish state for dicriminating against, and 
even refusing to recognize, Alevis as a separate religious 
group (note: Alevis are heterodox Muslims who account for as 
much as 20 percent of the Turkish population), Alevi 
representative Esat Korkmaz surprised some by remarking that 
outright abolition of the Religious Affairs Directorate 
(Diyanet) would be dangerous.  Turkish journalist Rusen Cakir 
reminded the Europeans that Turkey is not monolithically 
religious and conservative, noting, for example, that it was 
not only the EU that opposed Turkey\'s recent effort to 
criminalize adultery, but also many in Turkey vocally opposed 
the effort as well.  On the question of borders, after one 
Euro MP voiced concerns that expansion to include Turkey 
might prove to be a \"Trojan Horse designed to weaken Europe,\" 
Galatasaray University professor Ahmet Insel retorted that 
much of the ongoing debate is \"not about Turkey and the EU\'s 
borders at all, but European identity and the EU\'s future.\" 
Turkish identity was also a recurring theme.  Zulfu Livaneli 
remarked, \"I felt European until I went to Europe for the 
first time,\" and stressed that Turks are the most Eastern of 
the Western societies and want to play that role. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: The Istanbul Green Party Conference 
provided a useful opportunity for European politicians to 
come together with their Turkish counterparts and with 
elements of Turkey\'s civil society.  It showcased not just 
the hopes and fears that accompany the accession project, but 
also the impact that process has had on Turkey, leaving 
panelists free to advance arguments that a short decade ago 
would have led to their arrest and imprisonment.  Given the 
delicacy with which local taboos were broached and the 
vociferous response generated, however, it is clear that 
Turkey remains in the early stages of grappling with issues 
of history and identity.  As for the Europeans, Nuray Mert, 
columnist for the daily Radikal, questioned whether coming to 
Turkey and debating, while also \"acting as if Ramazan was not 
going on,\" really creates a bridge to the Muslim world.  In 
addition, instead of simply viewing Turkey as the sweetener 
in a cup of coffee, changing the taste but not the 
appearance, she argued, Europeans need to be willing to 
accept it as the creamer instead, affecting both at the same 
time.  Only such an approach, she suggested, will permit a 
true partnership between the two sides.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: KUCUKARMUTLU: APPLE OF ISTANBUL\'S EYE AND 
POLITICAL HOT POTATO 
 
REF: 03 ANKARA 2914 
 
1. (u) Summary: A storm is brewing in the Istanbul 
neighborhood of Kucukarmutlu, pitting Istanbul Technical 
University (ITU) and its plans for a technology park against 
local residents and politicians.  ITU recently reiterated its 
intention to seek implementation of court decisions to evict 
tens of thousands of illegal residents on 90 hectares of land 
it owns in Kucukarmutlu, one of the largest remaining 
\"gecekondu,\" or squatter, neighborhoods in central Istanbul 
(Note: Istanbul\'s sprawling poorer suburbs still contain such 
neighborhoods).  Although merely the most recent of many such 
disputes, its breath-taking views of the Bosphorus and 
convenient proximity to downtown Istanbul make Kucukarmutlu a 
particularly contentious and intractable dispute between the 
rule of law and political expediency and reality.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (u) Settled between 40 and 50 years ago by economic 
migrants from the Black Sea and central Anatolia, 
Kucukarmutlu tells a story typical of greater Istanbul.  Poor 
city planning and an inability to absorb a flood of 
immigrants led many of the poorer arrivals to construct their 
own housing on whatever available land they could find. 
Local politicians eager for fresh votes looked the other way 
as these \"gecekondu,\" or squatter, settlements illegally 
appropriated both government and private property.  In an 
effort to meet the needs of constituents and appeal for their 
votes, local officials later began to provide municipal 
services (e.g., water, electricity) to these communities, 
gradually converting them to more established neighborhoods. 
Today, with newly paved roads, bus routes, schools, mosques, 
an array of local businesses, and even some middle-to-higher 
quality housing stock, only its relative poverty and 
incongruous breath-taking views of the Bosphorus distinguish 
Kucukarmutlu from other central Istanbul neighborhoods.  A 
resident and shopkeeper boasted recently to poloff that 
Kucukarmutlu is \"the apple of Istanbul\'s eye.\" 
 
3. (sbu) Istanbul courts have already ruled in favor of ITU 
in hundreds of legal cases in the neighborhood.  Now worried 
they may be evicted from their homes, thousands of 
Kucukarmutlu residents marched on October 18 to the offices 
of Sariyer district Mayor Yusuf Tulun.  In his second 
(non-consecutive) term as Sariyer mayor, Tulun told the press 
that his office opposed the ITU project.  \"There isn\'t a 
square centimeter of empty space.  They (ITU) made their 
plans without asking us... We should give the people deeds 
(to their houses),\" he added.  In an earlier meeting with 
poloff, Tulun emphasized his desire to be responsive to his 
constituents and detailed plans for popular projects in each 
of Sariyer\'s neighborhoods.  Nurettin Cosan, the elected 
neighborhood representative for most of Kucukarmutlu, 
separately told poloff that both his constituents and the 
university are victims in this matter; a just solution must 
be found that takes care of all concerned (read: the 
government or city should shoulder the costs involved).  ITU 
Rector Faruk Karadogan told poloff that ITU is determined to 
keep the land.  If the politicians are willing to take 
responsibility for the situation, however, Karadogan thinks a 
win-win solution can be found (probably by building larger 
apartment blocks and relocating some residents). 
 
4. (sbu) Despite the fact that much of the land in 
Kucukarmutlu belongs to the greater Istanbul municipality, 
senior Istanbul officials are largely sympathetic to the 
plight of the Kucukarmutlu residents.  Ramazan Evren, the 
Secretary General of the Istanbul Municipality, reminded 
 
SIPDIS 
poloff that the city had reached relocation agreements with a 
number of Kucukarmutlu residents in order to expand a key 
access road through the neighborhood to the city\'s major 
international highway.  He estimated, however, that similar 
agreements for the whole area would cost USD 1 billion -- a 
price neither the city nor the government is prepared to 
shoulder (Note: Because many of the residents merely \"rent\" 
their apartments, Karadogan claims the costs would be lower). 
 Evren noted that the city is working closely with ITU (a 
claim that Karadogan denied), the Sariyer municipality, and 
others to look for solutions, but added that he could not 
envision any in which the neighborhood would be evacuated. 
Ilker Ayci, newly-appointed member of the Istanbul Exceutive 
Committee, concurred that the neighborhood was unlikely to be 
evacuated.  He shrugged his shoulders, reminded poloff that 
the problem began decades ago, and remarked, \"we just got 
caught holding the hot potato.\" 
 
5. (u) Mahmut Ovur, Istanbul editor for daily Sabah 
newspaper, described the situation in similar terms.  Despite 
having a valid property deed and court decisions to back its 
claims, Ovur saw no chance at all for ITU to have the 
eviction decisions enforced.  Instead, he argued that, in all 
likelihood, ITU was merely hoping to force local officials to 
compensate it with another piece of land elsewhere. 
According to Ovur, in addition to proper city planning (long 
absent in Istanbul), the solution to such gecekondu problems 
is to open up new land for development and to sell squatters 
the deeds to their land (ideas supported by PM Erdogan in 
proposed reforms last year, reftel).  Ovur predicted that 
after Turkey gets its invitation to begin EU negotiations in 
December, the AKP government would push ahead with reforms 
along these lines.  The bigger problem, according to Ovur, is 
illegal construction.  Most buildings in Istanbul are built 
on legally-owned land, but without proper building permits. 
As a result, tens of thousands of buildings (with more being 
built every day) are now believed to be susceptible to damage 
or collapse in a major earthquake.  Reinforcing or rebuilding 
them would cost tens of billions of dollars and the city has 
yet to put forth a plan to address this key issue. 
 
6. (sbu) Comment: Only seven months in office, the new 
Istanbul municipality has already grappled with several 
property issues.  Plans to demolish buildings susceptible to 
flood damage in the Alibeykoy neighborhood sparked public 
outrage until the city offered generous relocation packages 
to affected residents.  Even after concluding similar offers 
prior to the destruction of a dozen or so buildings in the 
Pendik district to make room for a school, local officials 
and police faced open riots by nervous gecekondu residents 
there.  Given the difficulties sparked by these small-scale 
problems, it is highly unlikely that local officials would be 
capable (were they so inclined) of evacuating the much-larger 
contested area in the Kucukarmutlu neighborhood.  Current 
political realities will dictate that the rule of law take a 
back seat in this dispute.  Its implications, however, for 
the city\'s ability to address the much larger and more 
serious issues of illegal construction and earthquake 
preparedness are worrying.

1. (sbu) Summary: There is a solid strain of Turkish opinion 
promoting the idea of \"reciprocity\" re dealing with the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate.  Increasingly, opinion makers and 
the GOT attempt to justify the current situation by citing 
the \"mistreatment\" of Turks living in Greece.  The 
Association for the Solidarity of Turks of Western Thrace 
disavows any animosity towards the small Greek community in 
Istanbul, but claims that Greece continues to: repress 
Turkish efforts to assert their ethnic identity, restrict 
their freedom to choose religious leaders, and provide 
inadequate Turkish-language educational facilities.  Although 
linking the treatment of the two minorities has no valid 
legal basis, doing so resonates with wider public opinion. 
End Summary. 
 
Turks of Western Thrace -- Red Herring?... 
------------------------------------------ 
2. (sbu) Meeting with poloff in early October, board members 
of the Association for the Solidarity of Turks of Western 
Thrace (ASTWT) outlined their positions and sought to justify 
a \"siege\" of the Patriarchate they carried out as far back as 
1991.  Founded in 1946 by Turks from western Thrace, ASTWT 
now has 15,000 registered members at branches in 15 cities in 
Turkey.  ASTWT uses its charitable foundations, sports clubs, 
and community centers to reach out to 64,000 Turks from 
western Thrace and their families.  ASTWT President 
Burhaneddin Hakguder disavowed all terrorism and violence, 
describing the 1991 \"siege\" of the Patriarchate as a peaceful 
demonstration that sought to draw attention to the Greek 
government\'s decision, for the first time, to reject the 
popular election of a muftu by a Turkish community in western 
Thrace (Note: Metropolitan Meliton, Secretary of the Holy 
Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, told poloff that he was 
in the building at the time and that it had certainly \"felt\" 
like a near-violent siege).  The Greek government continues 
to deny approval of elected muftus and insists on appointing 
its own. 
 
3. (sbu) Denying any animosity towards the Patriarch or Greek 
community here, ASTWT board members argued they are the 
victims of a \"double-standard.\"  According to them, the Greek 
government has systematically sought to eliminate any sense 
of ethnic identity among its Turkish population.  Until 
passage of a new citizenship law in 2000, permission to open 
businesses and even obtain certain driving licenses was 
denied.  Courts continue to reject applications for 
organizations with the word \"Turk\" in the name; one judge 
even argued that \"there are no Turks\" in Greece.  Turkish 
schools are deliberately under-funded and under-staffed to 
the point where responsible parents feel compelled to send 
their children to Greek schools.  One board member claimed 
that his niece\'s textbook at one such school still claims, 
for example, that \"some day\" man will reach the moon.  Greece 
refuses to lift restrictions on the number of Turkish 
instructors who can come to Greece (currently capped at 15; 
there are well over 200 Turkish schools).  Finally, Hakguder 
claimed that until Greece was forced to revise its laws in 
1989, over 60,000 Turks were stripped of their Greek 
citizenship, often simply for leaving the country.  To this 
day those former Greek citizens have no recourse to appeal 
the decisions. 
 
... Or Political Cover? 
----------------------- 
4. (c) While condemning violent measures employed by some 
radical groups that have perpetrated attacks against the 
Patriarchate in the past, a wide range of Turkish academics, 
journalists, bureaucrats, and politicians routinely opposes 
any reforms or measures to address outstanding concerns of 
the minority religious communities on the grounds that Greece 
must also cease any such discrimination against its Turkish 
population.  The Istanbul Muftu, Mustafa Cagrici, made this 
argument at a conference on minority issues earlier this 
year.  The Acting Director for the Istanbul General 
Directorate for Foundations also made the same argument in 
meetings with poloffs.  Columnists, including former 
Motherland party Education Minister Hasan Celal Guzel, 
retired Ambassador and True Path parliamentarian Coskun 
Kirca, and former Democratic Left parliamentarian Ahmet Tan, 
among others, have all made the same connection in newspaper 
columns.  Most recently, Education Minister Celik also told 
the Ambassador there is a link between the treatment western 
Thrace\'s Turks and the search for a solution to permit the 
reopening of the Greek Orthodox seminary on Heybeli Island 
(Halki)(ref c). 
5. (sbu) This linkage of the Greek minority\'s position in 
Turkey with the plight of Turks in Greece is based on a 
debatable legal interpretation of the 1923 Treaty of 
Lausanne, which brought an end to the Turkish war of 
independence and established the Turkish Republic\'s modern 
borders.  Section III of the Treaty on the Protection of 
Minorities obligated Turkey to ensure freedom of religion and 
equal political and civil rights for all of its nationals. 
Article 45 at the end of Section III states that, \"The rights 
conferred by the provisions of the present Section on the 
non-Moslem minorities of Turkey will be similarly conferred 
by Greece on the Moslem minority in her territory.\" 
 
6. (sbu) Legal interpretations aside, linking the treatment 
of the two minority populations resonates with a broad 
cross-section of Turkish public opinion.  The perception here 
that Greece continues to discriminate against its Muslim 
population has become a de facto obstacle in the resolution 
of outstanding religious freedom issues in Turkey.  Many 
Turks continue to cite the same grievances listed by the 
ASTWT above, including the right of Turks in Greece to 
appoint their own muftus, inadequate funding of Turkish 
schools, and a general desire to suppress any sense of ethnic 
identity among the population there.  Greece\'s failure to 
construct a mosque in Athens before this year\'s Summer 
Olympic Games, despite its commitments to do so, was 
regularly cited earlier this year as further proof of its 
recalcitrant attitude on this issue.  Turkish newspapers also 
recently gave prominent coverage to a November incident in 
which a Greek television crew filmed an 
\"inappropriately\"-dressed woman in a mosque used by Turks 
living in Greece (Note: They also reported that Greek 
prosecutors had launched an investigation). 
 
7. (c) Comment: Although we make every effort to convince 
Turks that linking the problems of the two minorities is 
counterproductive, it is an argument that appears to have 
solid traction among a large number of Turks here in 
Istanbul.  Treatment of Turks in Greece is an issue that we 
leave for Embassy Athens to address, but we assure our 
interlocutors that our Mission in Greece is every bit as 
diligent as we are in investigating and raising human rights 
violations.  For better or worse, however, the issue has 
become a de facto obstacle for progress on Halki and other 
issues relating to the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

This cable was coordinated with Embassy Ankara. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: A range of Turkish companies active in Iraq 
outlined their main concerns in a November 5 meeting with 
Turkey Caucus co-chair Representative Ed Whitfield.  Security 
and payment issues headed the list, with companies reporting 
not just serious problems in ensuring the safe delivery of 
their shipments, but also in problems in receiving payment 
for their contracts.  Ercumen Aksoy, head of the Turkish-Iraq 
Business Council, and Mehmet Habbab, CEO of Delta Petroleum, 
who organized the meeting, made a strong pitch for a U.S. 
umbrella to ensure that payments are made for outstanding 
contracts.  The companies who attended noted that they have a 
cumulative 500 million USD in payments outstanding in Iraq, 
and that interruption in fuel oil shipments since the 
beginning of October has undermined the barter system through 
which many Turkish contracts were financed.  The problem also 
threatens the project by which Karadeniz Energy has provided 
electrical power to Iraq (ref b).  Osman Karadeniz indicated 
that unless a way is found to ensure delivery of heavy fuel 
oil, the company will not be able to fulfill its part of the 
bargain.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Payment woes: Companies represented at the lunch, in 
addition to Delta Petroleum and Karadeniz Energy, included 
major shippers such as Tefirom (the first company to sign a 
contract with the CPA to deliver oil to Iraq), Tekfen (a 
major construction firm active in Iraq since the 1980s), and 
freight forwarders such as Ets. A. Boutros and Fils. 
Collectively, the companies present noted that they are owed 
some 500 million USD in Iraq, and that in some cases even 
contracts dating to the period of the Coalition Provisional 
Authority (CPA) have not been honored.  Several companies 
noted that although Iraqi officials participated in the 
elaboration of these contracts, on attempting to pursue them 
now with the Iraqi interim government, a number of ministries 
are disclaiming responsibility for the contracts and 
directing them to speak to \"the Americans.\"  Only Tekfen 
indicated that it was experiencing no problem with payment 
for its work in Iraq, as a result of the fact that it is paid 
from the account that Iraq built up in Halk Bank in Turkey 
through the \"Oil for Food\" program. 
 
3. (SBU) Umbrella: Delta Petroleum\'s Mehmet Habbab made a 
pitch for an \"American umbrella\" to cover Turkish companies\' 
contracts with SOMO.  He noted that Turkish businessmen 
currently deliver close to 7000 tons of oil products to Iraq 
daily, but that since SOMO took over responsibility for the 
contracts in July 2004 deliveries have become haphazard as 
payments are delayed for over 90 days.  As a result, the 
trade functions on a \"stop and go\" basis, with businessmen 
stopping deliveries until funds are received and then 
restarting them.  The resultant intermittent nature of the 
delivery system, in Habbab and his colleagues\' view, creates 
\"havoc\" and constant shortages.  Habbab thus suggested that 
the U.S. guarantee Iraqi payments in case of default-- 
something that he argued would not cost anything as funds are 
available in Iraq and the U.S. can control receipts.  Such an 
arrangement, he argued, could contribute enormously to Iraq\'s 
recovery at a fraction of the cost of outstanding 
reconstruction contracts.  Turgut Bozkurt, who works as an 
advisor with Tefirom, noted that shippers had factored 60-day 
payment delays into their planning, but that the delays now 
exceed 90 days.  Companies will work even with this, he said, 
so long as there is a guarantee that they will be paid in the 
end. 
 
4. (SBU) Security Issues: In addition to the payment issue, 
companies remain focused on their security difficulties. 
Even with its payment advantage, Tekfen noted that work has 
ground to a halt on many of its projects for security 
reasons.  Other companies, including shippers in particular, 
reported similar security problems with regard to their 
deliveries.  As Ankara and Istanbul have reported earlier, 
they indicated that the problem is most acute on the return 
trip, when trucks generally are not in convoys.  Delta\'s 
Mehmet Habbab said that four of his contract drivers have 
been killed; other companies indicated that they have also 
experienced casualties.  Overall, Habbab suggested that over 
30 percent of the goods shipped from Turkey are squandered, 
representing a daily loss of 1.5 million USD per day. 
Looking at the larger picture, Ercument Aksoy stressed that 
the security situation poses serious challenges for the 
viability of Turkish trade in Iraq.  He noted that the 
security problems have driven freight rates to Baghdad up 
from 1800 USD to nearly 4500 USD per truck from Turkey. 
Given that rates from Jordan and Kuwait remain a fraction of 
that level (he quoted a figure of 1000-1200 USD), he 
predicted that while Turkish exports to Iraq this year are 
near 1.6 billion USD, they will not be able to reach that 
level again next year unless the security situation improves. 
 Habbab suggested that one solution might be for the U.S. to 
permit private security firms to offer security to Turkish 
trucks on the road all the way to Baghdad.  He argued that 
truckers would be happy to pay for such a service, and that 
such an arrangement would ease the burden on U.S. military 
personnel. 
 
5. (SBU) Energy: Among the projects hampered by the security 
situation is Karadeniz Holding\'s sale of electricity to 
northern Iraq.  Osman Karadeniz reiterated points he made to 
the Embassy (ref b), noting that the company has yet to 
receive a single shipment of heavy fuel oil from Iraq.  While 
earlier bureaucratic problems have been ironed out, security 
constraints currently preclude delivery of the supplies. 
This has been the case, he said, since the 101st Airborne, 
which co-signed the original agreement, left the country.  He 
noted that they have no alternative to the heavy fuel oil 
from Iraq, since their special import permit from Turkey only 
applies to Iraqi fuel oil.  He expressed hope, but not 
necessarily optimism, that the situation can be resolved in 
the near future.  If it is not, however, he said the company 
will not be able to continue to supply the amount of power it 
promised to Iraq.  Habbab suggested that if the security 
situation continues to preclude the fuel shipments, the U.S. 
might instead seek to pressure the Turkish government to 
allow import of fuel oil from other supply points to enable 
Karadeniz to fulfill its contract.

1. (SBU) Summary: In separate meetings the week of November 
8, Istanbul business leaders told visiting State Department 
Special Representative for Commercial and Business Affairs 
Frank Mermoud and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union 
Rockwell Schnabel that they are optimistic both about 
Turkey\'s overall economic prospects and about the outcome of 
the December 17 EU summit.  Business leaders were relatively 
pragmatic about the October 6 EU Commission report, 
recognizing the balance it sought strike between Turkey and 
sceptical European publics.    They stressed, however, that 
there should be no dilution of the ultimate goal of full 
Turkish membership in the EU.  Only that prospect, they 
argued, will make Turkey\'s reform process irrevocable and 
overcome the entrenched interests that will otherwise resist 
surrendering the concessions and privileges they now enjoy. 
A cautionary note was struck by TUSIAD foreign relations 
chief Cem Duna, who warned that the negotiations will 
highlight the divergent interests of different parts of the 
Turkish economy, and that it will not be easy for the country 
to formulate a common negotiating position.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The November 8 visit of Special Representative Mermoud 
and November 10-13 visit of USEU Ambassador Schnabel 
permitted us to touch base with a broad cross-section of the 
Istanbul business community and regauge sentiment both about 
Turkey\'s current economic conjuncture and about prospects for 
Turkey to receive a date to begin negotiations at the EU\'s 
December 17th summit.  Mermoud\'s meetings ranged from 
bilateral business groups such as the American Business Forum 
in Turkey and the Turkish-American Business Association, to 
the Foreign Investors\' Association (YASED) and such leading 
American investors as Coca-Cola, Cargill and Motorola.  In 
addition to TUSIAD (the Turkish Businessmen\'s and 
Industrialist\'s Association), Ambassador Schnabel also met 
with representatives of the Turkey-EU Business Council, ING 
Bank Managing Director John McCarthy and Finansbank Chairman 
Husnu Ozyegin. 
 
3. (U) Bullish Outlook: Both Mermoud and Schnabel\'s 
interlocutors were generally upbeat on Turkey\'s prospects in 
the near to mid-term.  ING\'s McCarthy noted that Turkey is 
currently experiencing the best economic period he has seen 
in his twenty-plus years in Turkey.  He stressed that the 
bank, while \"realistic\" about problems that continue to 
exist, such as corruption and an inadequate legal system, is 
generally \"bullish\" on Turkey.  Cem Duna, TUSIAD\'s foreign 
relations chief (and a former Turkish Ambassador to the EU), 
echoed this positive appraisal, pointing not just to the work 
that has been done in recent years to restore \"macro 
balances\" in the economy, but also structural changes such as 
the creation of independent regulatory boards that are now 
working \"more or less\" effectively.  He noted that work has 
also begun on legal reform, though he conceded that with only 
10,000 judges and prosecutors for a population of 70 million 
people, Turkey still has a long way to go.  EU Business 
Council leaders pointed up their expectation that the ongoing 
economic recovery will enable the country to overcome some of 
the limitations that have held it back in the past.  Turkey\'s 
underdeveloped capital markets, for instance, have suffered 
from the absence of institutional investors, but with the 
recent creation of private pension plans and the prospect of 
development of a mortgage system in the next two years, there 
is hope that these markets can be deepened and strengthened. 
Only Cargill\'s Corporate Affairs Director Mustafa Sayinatac 
was more pessimistic about Turkey\'s mid-term prospects, 
pointing to such issues as Turkey\'s budget and current 
account deficits, the absence of foreign direct investment, 
and his belief the economy is overheating.  McCarthy, 
however, opined that this year\'s growth and current account 
deficit reflect the satisfaction of pent-up demand and will 
ease next year: ING sees growth moderating to 4.8 percent in 
2005, he said. 
 
4. (SBU) An EU Stamp of Approval: Business leaders stressed 
their belief that Turks feel a strong emotional pull to 
Europe, based in large part on the belief that EU membership 
will bring about an improvement in the standard of living 
here.  For business, Duna said, the key advantage the EU will 
bring is \"predictability.\"  Business council leaders 
elaborated that they expect that some of the key problems 
which currently hamper their activities, such as red tape and 
an inadequate legal system, will be addressed as part of the 
negotiating process.  While (like Duna) they were generally 
understanding of the balance the commission had sought to 
strike in its October 6 report, they stressed the importance 
of avoiding \"additional qualifiers\" on December 17, since 
this would reduce the impact of a positive decision.  The 
key, they suggested, is that the \"carrot of full membership\" 
remain clearly in front of Turkey, since only that prospect 
will convince economic actors here to be willing to give up 
the concessions and privileges that they have enjoyed in the 
past.  Not all saw the report\'s emphasis of the \"open-ended\" 
nature of the negotiations as all negative, however.  Tezcan 
Yaramanci, Chairman of BankEuropa, reflecting a viewpoint we 
are hearing more and more from the business community, noted 
that this may work to Turkey\'s benefit, since once it has 
made the changes necessary to join Europe (and benefited 
economically from them), it may find that it no longer wants 
to join the club. 
 
5. (SBU) Challenges Ahead: All agreed that the challenges 
facing Turkey will only intensify after December 17.  Duna, 
who is often mentioned as a candidate for the post of 
Secretary General of Turkey\'s EU negotiating team, noted that 
 
SIPDIS 
he is concerned about the difficulties that the negotiating 
process will pose for Turkey as it attempts to formulate 
national positions on various economic issues.  \"The fault 
lines will be more obvious,\" he predicted, and companies will 
be divided based on the nature of their operations. 
Cargill\'s Sayinatac pointed to the difficulties that will 
result from the need to reconcile Turkey\'s enormous 
agricultural sector with that of the EU, while Coca-Cola\'s 
Bozer dismissed the argument that large Turkish companies are 
not ready for the EU (\"the Customs Union has prepared them\"), 
but conceded that he is concerned about how Turkish SMEs will 
react.  Most, including members of Turkey\'s EU busienss 
councils, concurred that there is currently little 
understanding in Turkey, even among specialists, about what 
EU membership actuallly entails and about the changes that 
Turkey will be asked to undertake.  They predicted more than 
a few difficult moments as Turkey is asked to make changes to 
harmonize with the acquis. 
 
6. (SBU) Foreign Investment: All agreed that while the EU 
stamp of approval, a sort of ISO 9000 certificate, will mark 
a \"paradigm shift\" for both the EU and Turkey, by itself it 
will not be enough to spark an inflow of foreign direct 
investment.  Business council leaders pointed to ongoing 
problems such as red tape, heavy taxation, and Turkey\'s legal 
system as factors that will take time to address, so that 
even with a date Turkey will remain \"far down the list\" of 
potential investment locations.  Coca-Cola President Ahmet 
Bozer, whose own company\'s IPO was pulled on the day he met 
with Mermoud, predicted that investment would flow only after 
the \"tipping point\" in negotiations is reached and Turkish EU 
membership appears inevitable.  Mustafa Alper, YASED\'s new 
Secretary General, noted that his organization is seeing 
 
SIPDIS 
increased interest in Turkey, particularly from Asian 
countries, as it draws nearer to the EU.  But he conceded 
that this has not yet translated into new flows of FDI and 
that while much new legislation has been adopted, 
implementation issues remain.  The \"bureaucracy is tough,\" he 
noted, and it will take time to tackle it, legal reform, and 
taxation.  He added that while the government has been 
extremely responsive on many issues, outstanding areas of 
dispute do remain.  Most notably, private sector/government 
disagreement over how a new Investment Promotion Agency 
should be structured and managed has resulted in its being 
put on hold for the forseeable future.  Overally, however, he 
assessed that the investment climate remains \"cloudy, but is 
getting better.\" 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: Ambassador Schnable and Special 
Representative Mermoud\'s meetings provided a useful snapshot 
of where Turkish business is in its thinking about the 
Turkish economy generally and EU relations specifically. 
Optimism was widespread that Turkey will receive a date on 
December 17, that will enable it to take its relationship 
with the EU, and its economy as well, to a new level.  Few 
were eager to speculate about an alternative \"doomsday\" 
scenario, though most agreed that failure to secure a date 
would result in a sharp economic correction and threaten the 
country\'s hard won political and economic stability.  Duna 
predicted that such a development would lead opposition 
forces (whether in the establishment or fundamentalist 
circles) to challenge the reforms that Turkey has achieved in 
recent years.  But he expressed hope that those changes have 
already become so entrenched that the Turkish people would 
not accept going back to the old way of doing things even 
even in such a worst case scenario.  End Comment.

This cable was coordinated with Embassy Ankara. 
 
1. (sbu) Summary: Open warfare between main opposition CHP 
leader Deniz Baykal and Mustafa Sarigul (\"Yellow Rose\" in 
Turkish), the popular CHP mayor of Istanbul\'s Sisli district, 
will probably lead to Sarigul\'s eviction from the party.  Few 
observers doubt that the corruption allegations against 
Sarigul; it is equally obvious that  Baykal is using the 
issue to try to eliminate an upstart rival who has spent 
months \"campaigning\" in front of staged rallies in Anatolia 
far from his district.  From Istanbul it appears that 
Sarigul, who has made little effort to conceal his ambition 
to replace Baykal, foolishly overplayed his cards.  From 
Ankara, we see the possibility that Sarigul, backed by 
retired left-nationalist military officers and disgraced 
former political heavyweights, may once again switch parties 
and try to take over the moribund center-right DYP.  However, 
despite his image as a \"common-touch\" politician and his 
enduring popularity, Sarigul lacks the party organization to 
marry his overweening prime ministerial ambitions with facts 
on the ground.  In any event, the Baykal-Sarigul clash is 
further degrading CHP\'s already heavily-damaged reputation. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (sbu) Beleaguered main opposition Republican People\'s 
Party (CHP) has briefly raised its profile again on the back 
of stories detailing party infighting and corruption.  On 
November 16, CHP Secretary General announced the findings of 
an internal party investigation into corruption allegations 
against Istanbul Sisli district mayor Mustafa Sarigul.  The 
report claims that Sarigul took USD 300,000 in bribes several 
years ago to allow the construction of several illegal 
buildings in Sisli and, as a result, recommends that he be 
expelled from the party.  Sarigul responded immediately, 
calling the accusations baseless, charging the CHP leadership 
with seeking to stifle the \"people\'s will,\" and promising to 
open a defamation suit. 
 
3. (c) Based on what we know about Sarigul personally and 
municipal politics in general, there is little doubt that the 
CHP charges have merit; Sarigul is also the subject of a 
simultaneous ongoing official corruption investigation.  Both 
the Consulate and the Embassy (refs) have heard reports of 
Sarigul\'s corruption and unsavory business connections. 
Granting dubious building permits or looking the other way on 
illegal construction, moreover, is precisely how many local 
district mayors cash in on their positions.  On the other 
hand, if USD 300,000 were the extent of Sarigul\'s corruption 
(and given that he is known as \"Mister 15 percent,\" such a 
low figure is unlikely), that would probably make him one of 
the cleaner mayors in Istanbul. 
 
4. (c) As such, it is clear that CHP\'s investigation and 
report were politically motivated.  Even CHP party insider, 
and another would-be Baykal challenger, Hursit Gunes admitted 
to poloff that Baykal is simply eliminating a political 
(albeit corrupt) rival.  A wide range of CHP contacts have 
told us for years that Sarigul enjoys little support within 
the party structure, but his emergence in recent months as an 
apparently viable challenger to Baykal had earned him the 
support of several dissident MPs.  According to Gunes, 
however, this latest development may cost him even that 
meager support (although about a dozen CHP MPs have defied 
the party leadership\'s threats of punishment and promised to 
attend a November 20 Sarigul rally in the southern port city 
of Mersin). 
 
5. (c) If he is eventually expelled from the party, as 
contacts in Istanbul now expect, Sarigul may seek to 
capitalize on his local popularity and name recognition by 
forming his own party.  Without an organized and effective 
party base, however, it is unlikely that Sarigul would be 
more than a flash in the pan.  (Indeed, political observers 
in Ankara point to the fact that Sarigul buses in supporters 
for his Anatolian rallies, another sign that his popular 
support outside Istanbul is no more than media hype).  On the 
other hand, we have heard in Ankara that, backed by 
now-disgraced former ANAP PM Yilmaz and former DSP Deputy PM 
Ozkan, Sarigul may try to work out a deal with current 
center-right DYP leader Agar and, switching parties for the 
third time, take over DYP. 
 
6. (sbu) The more immediate question is how much this latest 
leadership struggle in CHP will further damage CHP\'s already 
poor image as a lackluster opposition party.  For better or 
worse, Sarigul is one of the CHP\'s most telegenic 
politicians, at least in Istanbul.  He won reelection on 
March 28 with almost 70 percent of the vote in Sisli and he 
has used his public relation skills and establishment allies 
to stay in the press.  Expulsion from CHP may benefit Baykal 
personally, but further heightens the Baykal-imposed bunker 
mentality in CHP.  Gunes acknowledged, for example, that 
targeting Sarigul, while other more corrupt senior CHP 
officials sit untouched, is a further blow to CHP\'s 
credibility.

RIGHTS 
 
REF: ANKARA 6206 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Izmir business and religious leaders, NGOs 
and a journalist shared their views on human rights, Iraq, 
Turkey\'s EU membership and religious issues November 12 with 
Izmir liaison officer.  The Izmir branches of the Human 
Rights Foundation and the Bar Association, both involved with 
legal access and medical aspects of torture, noted their 
displeasure with U.S. policy in Iraq.   The muftu\'s office 
stressed increasing religiosity in Izmir, including 
applicants for the hajj and in Koranic classes.   EGIAD, the 
Young Businessmen\'s Association, was focussed on EU 
membership and eager to establish contacts with U.S. 
businessmen associations and participate in U.S. trade 
missions and fairs.   Former MP and Hurriyet Aegean rep 
Tartan was confident of the role model Izmir could serve as 
an EU city.   End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Izmir Deputy Muftu Cemil Karaguz discussed the 
responsibilities of the muftu,s office, including overseeing 
200 mosques in the Izmir region, and administration of 
Koranic courses, both short and long term, which attract many 
youth as well as women.   He claimed that religiosity in 
Izmir has increased in recent years, and that the number of 
applicants for the hajj in Izmir doubled from 3,000 to 6,000 
for 2005 -- with half of the applicants women.   In the final 
days before Ramazan Bayram, the muftu\'s office was busy 
answering inquiries from residents regarding the amount of 
zekah (tithe in income to the poor, one of the requirements 
of Islam) to be distributed.    The assistant to the muftu 
noted that the imams deal with current concerns such as the 
growth of pickpocketing by reinforcing moral values in their 
weekly khutbas (sermons).   (Comment: Although the muftu 
office\'s views on the growth of religiosity may be 
overstated, the influx of residents to the Izmir region from 
the southeast may be changing the traditionally more secular 
character of the population.  End comment.) 
 
3. (SBU) Lawyers at the Izmir Bar Association, a 4800-member 
organization that concentrates on human rights and the 
prevention of torture, discussed their goals to ensure that 
all detainees are guaranteed access to a lawyer following 
arrest, and that detainees who claim they were tortured are 
examined by qualified medical doctors.   They were eager to 
re-establish contact with USG representatives, but underlined 
their concern about U.S. policy in Iraq. 
 
4. (SBU) Sharing the Bar Association,s concern about U.S. 
Iraq policy and human rights was the Izmir branch of the 
Human Rights Foundation of Turkey, an NGO that provides 
physical and psychological treatment and rehabilitation 
services to those subject to torture.  Dr. Veli Lok heads a 
group of four reputable medical doctors at the Izmir branch, 
who offer their services on a volunteer basis and approach 
the problem clinically.  Sharing statistics on examinees in 
Izmir in 2004, he noted that of the 122 cases to date, 27 
were women, 40 were victims of torture,  over 99 per cent of 
the examinees originated from the southeast and 90-95 per 
cent were of Kurdish origin.  At the conclusion of the 
meeting, Dr. Lok criticized U.S. policy in Iraq, commenting 
that U.S. concern about victims of torture in Turkey is 
matched by Turkish concern about Iraqi victims of torture by 
U.S. soldiers in Iraq.   Liaison officer stressed to both 
Associations the U.S. commitment  to human rights, and noted 
that these incidents are being dealt with legally. 
 
5. (SBU) Directors of EGIAD, the Aegean Young Businessmen,s 
Association, told liaison officer that their members had 
overcome initial concerns about EU membership and were now 
looking forward to the benefits EU accession would bring to 
commerce in Izmir.   EGIAD is an extremely active association 
and holds monthly meetings with speakers for all members as 
well as periodic smaller work groups on EU and foreign 
relations, IT, legal, press, and cultural issues.  They were 
eager to reinvigorate contacts with American young 
businessmen\'s associations and to participate in trade 
missions, trade fairs and matchmaker programs in the U.S. 
 
6. (SBU) Hakan Tartan, former DSP MP and Minister of Labor, 
who ran as a candidate of Ismail Cem\'s New Turkey Party in 
2002, is now Hurriyet\'s Aegean representative.  Tartan, a 
native of Izmir, was enthusiastic about Izmir\'s advantages in 
the cultural and commercial areas -- and further promoted 
this role of Izmir as a model city for Turkey\'s EU membership 
in his Hurriyet column November 13. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: In general,  the interlocutors expressed 
little concern about the nature of the continued U.S. 
presence in Izmir -- as opposed to the views conveyed to 
Ambassador Edelman during his October 25 visit to Izmir.

Classified By: Acting Consul General Stuart Smith for Reasons 1.5 (b&d) 
 
 
1. (c) Summary: Against the expectations of the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate, the Turkish Supreme Court on October 10 upheld 
a lower court decision revoking the Patriarch\'s deed of 
ownership for the long-vacated Greek Orthodox orphanage at 
Prinkipos (Buyukada) and awarded ownership to an 
already-confiscated Greek Orthodox foundation.  In losing 
this case, the Patriarchate not only exhausted its last legal 
recourse in Turkey to regain physical custody of one of its 
most historically-significant and potentially valuable 
properties, but also lost what it saw as an invaluable lever 
to force the Turkish state to grant the Patriarchate legal 
status.  Meanwhile, in another unpleasant surprise, the Greek 
Orthodox Balikli Hospital was recently notified by its 
district tax inspector that it owes five years of back taxes 
(despite the fact that they have tax-exempt status granted by 
Istanbul authorities).  The community is exploring legal 
options, but if the decision is enforced, it may be forced to 
close the hospital.  End Summary. 
 
2. (c) The Greek Orthodox orphanage at Prinkipos is a large, 
beautiful, wooden structure on Buyukada, an island in the 
Marmara Sea near Istanbul.  The building is significant to 
the Greek Orthodox community for both its historical and 
monetary value.  Vacated in the early 1960s, the building has 
fallen into a serious state of disrepair.  In 1997, the 
General Directorate of Foundations (GDF) initiated a legal 
process to have the 1902 deed (which is in the name of the 
Ecumenical Patriarch) transferred to the Greek Orthodox 
foundation administering the property (Note: Because the 
foundation had already been confiscated by the GDF, such a 
ruling would lead to the effective seizure of the orphanage). 
 Although it predates the Turkish Republic, the deed is 
perhaps the only formal document in which the Patriarchate 
has any legal status in the eyes of the Turkish state.  As 
such, the Patriarchate was confident that it had a strong 
legal case to maintain its claim to the property, and in so 
doing to force the Turkish state to grant the Patriarchate 
some measure of long-sought legal recognition.  The Supreme 
Court decision on October 10 upholding a lower court\'s 
decision to revoke the deed came as a complete surprise.  The 
Patriarchate intends to pursue the case at the European Court 
of Human Rights. 
 
3. (c) In another unexpected development, Metropolitan 
Meliton, Chief Secretary of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate, told poloff on November 21 that the non-profit 
Greek Orthodox Balikli Hospital has been notified that, 
despite its tax-exempt status, it may be forced to pay back 
taxes owed since 1999.  Local tax authorities have appointed 
a team to audit the hospital. The 450-bed hospital operates 
with about 200 staff, generates USD 2.6 million in annual 
revenue, is open to the general public, and accepts about 200 
charitable cases each year.  As such, the hospital is one of 
the few remaining vibrant institutions in an otherwise aging 
and vanishing community.  If it turns out that substantial 
sums are owed, Meliton predicted that the community would be 
forced to close the hospital.  Asked whether this might 
simply be a normal, bureaucratic process, Meliton was 
skeptical and particularly worried about the decision to 
apply laws that cover \"private,\" as opposed to non-profit, 
hospitals.  Working together with the hospital\'s management 
and the Greek Orthodox community\'s lawyers, the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate is planning a legal challenge to the decision 
and will also send letters to the Prime Minister, Health 
Minister, and others in the Turkish government. 
 
4. (c) Meliton indicated that the Greek community is not 
alone in facing this tax challenge: other minority religious 
communities have also been approached by the tax authorities 
in the past.  The small Bulgarian Orthodox community here, 
for instance, was forced to close their hospital in 1982 
after receiving a similar notification from the tax 
authorities.  The Jewish community, however, told us that 
they voluntarily established a commercial unit to manage 
their hospital\'s taxable accounts. Operating at a net loss, 
the Jewish hospital pays only some value-added taxes on 
purchases.  Similarly, the director of the non-profit 
American Hospital told poloff that his institution also pays 
only VAT and is subject to annual or biannual surprise 
audits. 
 
5. (c) Comment: The decision on the orphanage and the 
notification to the hospital at a time when Turkey should be 
on its best behavior before the December 17 European Council 
decision have left the Patriarchate frustrated and 
discouraged.  They feel that despite promises from the 
Turkish government there has been little real progress on 
their core concerns (legal status, reopening Halki, property 
restitution).  Additionally, they fear that the government is 
powerless or unwilling to stop elements of the Turkish state 
and bureaucracy hostile to the Greek Orthodox community from 
proceeding in a systematic campaign against them. 
 
6. (c) Comment, cont.: While the decision on the orphanage 
represents a serious setback for the community, we need to be 
aware that the Patriarchate\'s concern was not merely to 
recover the property, but also to use it to secure legal 
recognition of its status.  Additionally, it may be premature 
to conclude that the Turkish state is trying to force the 
community to close the Balikli hospital.  Judging by the 
experiences of other non-profit hospitals in Istanbul, these 
latest measures may simply be an effort to apply standard 
laws to the long-ignored Greek Orthodox hospital.

SUBJECT: CRITICISM OF U.S. POLICY IN IRAQ PERVADES BMNEAI 
CONFERENCE IN ISTANBUL 
 
REF: ANKARA 6293 
 
 1. (SBU) Summary: Linkage of the BMENAI with U.S. policy in 
Iraq was a common theme of speakers at a Cultural Initiative 
Symposium on the Greater Middle East and North Africa Project 
(BMENAI) in Istanbul in November.  A wide range of Turkish 
academics, former GOT officials, and European diplomats and 
journalists presented papers, but there was a noticeable 
absence of panelists from Middle Eastern countries due to the 
late start in organizing the conference.  While a number of 
speakers discussed in general terms Turkey,s contribution to 
BMENAI, few referred to Turkey,s participation in the 
Democracy Assistance Dialogue.  Former MFA U/S and panel 
chair Ozdem Sanberk explained on the margins that the GOT had 
done virtually nothing to move the process forward since late 
June, pending the results of the U.S. elections.  Panelists 
in general downplayed or ignored questions critical of 
Turkey\'s progress in reforms.  The anti-American tone of the 
conference set by former General Kemal Yavuz reflected 
suspicion of BMENAI.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The Istanbul Cultural and Artistic Foundation, 
chaired by Sakir Eczacibasi, sponsored a Cultural Initiative 
Symposium in Istanbul on the Greater Middle East and North 
Africa Project (BMENAI) November 8-10. Conference panelists 
included a wide range of Turkish academics, former ministers 
and generals, European diplomats, journalists, and 
professors.  A number of attendees commented on the lack of 
participation from the Islamic countries represented in the 
BMENAI.  According to a chairman of one of the panels, Dr. 
Ahmet Evin of Sabanci University, the conference organizers 
had a late start in organizing the conference and were unable 
to confirm speakers from the Middle East and North African 
countries. 
 
3. (SBU) In the opening session, former Deputy PM Erdal Inonu 
stressed that terror was the motivating factor for the 
BMNEAI.  Minister of Culture Erkan Mumcu underlined that 
peace, not terror, should be its theme.  Mumcu was confident 
that Turkey, with its experience in democratic reforms, could 
contribute a great deal to the initiative, and added that 
Turkey should express itself as an Islamic country. 
 
4. (SBU) Michael Lake, former EU Ambassador to Turkey, 
stressed that BMNEAI,s commitment to shared values of 
democracy, human rights, and a market economy contributes to 
resolution of conflicts in the region.  He was positive about 
Turkey,s accession prospects, and hopeful about prospects of 
reform for partner GOP countries.   Richard Falk of 
Princeton,s Center for International Studies underlined the 
shift of the U.S. post-cold war strategy from Europe to the 
Middle East/Islamic world, as the region that will determine 
the shape of the future )- and noted Turkey,s central role 
in the resolution of regional tensions.  He added that it is 
impossible to separate the BMNEAI from the post 9/11 global 
setting, and questioned whether democracy could be achieved, 
in light of U.S. policies to build long-range bases in Iraq, 
and its relations with Turkey and Israel. 
 
5. (SBU) William Hale of the University of London noted that 
the current AKP government,s introduction of legislation 
based on Islamic principles has stirred up opposition among 
secularists and in democratic countries, but has not broken 
democratic rules.   Former BBC Turkish bureau chief Andrew 
Mango commented that the BMNEAI has similarities with the 
Marshall Plan )- but instead of transferring funds, the 
BMENAI transfers skills.  Mango pointed out that the Turkish 
experience demonstrates the advantages the BMENAI offers to 
countries in the region. 
 
6. (SBU) Retired general Kemal Yavuz was sharply critical of 
the U.S. in his speech on the first day of the conference, 
linking the BMENAI with U.S. policy in Iraq, and calling the 
project &unrealistic, mistaken, and irresponsible  -- a 
threat to Turkey and to humanity.8   Yavuz asserted that 
Israel manages U.S. Middle East policy, that the U.S. goal is 
control of the flow of oil, and that the U.S. Secretary of 
Treasury promoted the current Iraq policy prior to 9/11. 
Yavuz noted that in the last one and a half years, 100,000 
Iraqis have been killed in war and occupation ) which will 
lead to extremism in the region.  He also criticized U.S. 
policy in Afghanistan as a plan to rule Asia.  Noting that 
every political project has a psychological component in 
order to create allies, Yavuz implied that the U.S. strategy 
in creating BMNEAI is to create allies for its Middle Eastern 
policy.  He added that until 10 years ago, foreigners used to 
implement destructive policies in Turkey.  Yavuz, speech 
received huge applause, and most questioners supported his 
anti-U.S. rhetoric. 
 
7. (SBU) This anti-American tone continued throughout much of 
the conference; in his presentation on the Asian view of the 
BMENAI at the end of day two of the conference, former OIC 
Assistant SecGen Arshad Zaman was openly hostile, criticizing 
the U.S. for using BMENAI to divert attention from Iraq. 
However, the Russian Ambassador in Ankara, Petr Stegniy, 
delivered a very thoughtful speech, in which he defended 
BMENAI and U.S. policy in Iraq, noting that key historical 
events (such as the French and Russian revolutions) are never 
understood until many years later.  After the panel, Stegniy 
commented that Russia is assisting the U.S. in promoting 
BMENAI in the region. 
 
8. (SBU) Yusuf Isik, an economist and Kemal Dervis\' advisor, 
referred to Turkey\'s role in the Democracy Assistance 
Dialogue (DAD) in a panel on the final day of the conference 
on Turkey\'s obligations vis a vis BMNEAI.  However, in 
general many panelists and questioners reflected a lack of 
detailed information about Turkey,s role in the DAD 
(reftel).  While speakers referred to Turkey,s contribution 
to the BMNEAI, in a number of instances throughout the 
seminar, questions regarding Turkey\'s role in the BMENAI and 
comments critical of its progress in democratic reforms were 
often downplayed or ignored by the panel chairs.  Former MFA 
Undersecretary Ozdem Sanberk acknowledged the lack of 
information about the Democracy Assistance Dialogue in 
official circles by early November.  He explained that 
virtually nothing had been done to move the process forward 
since late June, citing a desire to wait and see if the U.S. 
elections would bring a change in policy. 
 
9. (SBU) Comment: In the leadup to the 12/11 Forum for the 
Future in Morocco, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
the lead agency for BMENAI, has made progress toward 
publicizing Turkey,s role in the Democracy Assistance 
Dialogue, as noted in the MFA,s November 18 statement and 
questions and answers. However, Yavuz,s diatribe, the 
favorable reaction to it, panelists, lack of detailed 
information, and the anti-American tone of much of the 
Istanbul conference reveal that ignorance and suspicion about 
BMENAI remain high.  End comment.

This message has been coordinated with Embassy Ankara. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Leading Turkish textile exporters tell us 
they are deeply pessimistic about prospects for the sector, 
warning that the end of the global quota system next month 
will lead to mass layoffs in Turkey unless \"an exit\" is 
found.  In a recent meeting organized by the Istanbul Textile 
and Apparel Exporters\' Union (IKTIB), representatives of more 
than 30 companies that currently account for close to 1 
billion USD in exports to the U.S. cited not just \"unfair\" 
competition from China and India, but Qualified Industrial 
Zones (QIZ\'s) in Jordan and particularly the prospect of 
QIZ\'s in Egypt as serious threats to their future.  With 
textiles accounting for up to a third of industrial 
employment in Turkey, they predicted that a \"social crisis\" 
will emerge in coming years, since there are no other sectors 
that can absorb the work force that will be made redundant. 
They pressed for reconsideration of a Turkish QIZ including 
textiles as their only chance for the future. 
Representatives of leading U.S. textile importers concurred 
with this gloomy prognosis, noting that change will not come 
immediately, but predicting that over the next few years 
textile exports to the U.S. will decline 20-25 percent, while 
(Turkey\'s more significant) exports to the European Union 
could decline by as much as half.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Represented at our recent meeting with IKTIB were such 
leading firms as Altinyildiz, Sahin Holding, Erteks, Tureks, 
Istanbul Konfeksiyon, and Mithat Giyim.  While companies 
noted that they expect the impact of quota removal on overall 
Turkish export volumes to be felt over the next several 
years, they said that they are already feeling the squeeze on 
their profit margins.  Many have already taken steps to 
reduce their work force, laying off 5 to 10 percent of their 
employees.  Others have frozen investment plans, as they wait 
to see what will happen.  Most predicted a further 20 percent 
decline in employment as the impact of the lifting of quotas 
is fully absorbed.  Already, they said, the impact of China 
and India is being felt on the pricing side.   They 
characterized the pricing pressures they face as 
\"unbearable,\" and said most plants are not making any profit, 
but are simply operating to maintain market share.  Most of 
the orders they receive now from the U.S. are repetition 
orders, which are the secondary low volume orders that 
supplement primary bulk orders, many of which are now sourced 
to China. 
 
3. (SBU) Participants unanimously characterized the Far 
Eastern competition they face, primarily from China and 
India, as unfair.  Chinese producers, they argued, receive 
formal and informal subsidies ranging from free energy, cheap 
bank loans -- which are essentially grants since they are 
rarely repaid -- and government subsidies for exports.  They 
noted that these advantages are on top of a labor cost 
advantage whereby Chinese costs, at 45 USD per worker per 
month, are only a tenth of Turkey\'s 450 USD per month.  In 
addition, companies complained that while they are frequently 
inspected and forced to abide by strict codes of conduct, 
such codes are observed more in the breach in China and 
India, further enhancing those countries\' competitive edge. 
Producers noted ironically that Turkey\'s status as a 
mid-range producer has led it to be selected as a pilot 
country both by Western companies and countries for various 
pilot programs that add to their costs.  They also observed 
that they understand that Turkey will become a test country 
for a new U.S. port security program, while China and India 
have been exempted, because the program is not \"feasible\" 
given the volumes passing through their ports.  Comment: 
Industry representatives apparently do not realize that the 
Container Security Initiative, if implemented in Turkey, 
would actually provide them with a competitive advantage 
relative to producers in countries without access to a CSI 
port.  End Comment. 
 
4. (SBU) Beyond the Far Eastern threat confronting them, 
producers expressed concern about competitors closer to home. 
 They noted that QIZ\'s in Jordan and potentially in Egypt 
will take sales away from Turkey.  More generally, they 
complained that implementation of these and other 
preferential arrangements, in the Americas and sub-Saharan 
Africa, undercut them, and they asked rhetorically why such a 
benefit could not be provided to Turkey, given its 
longstanding strategic alliance with the U.S.  Already, 
several companies noted that they are considering moving 
production to Jordan to benefit from the QIZ (ironically the 
Istanbul-based Turkish American Business Association recently 
organized a briefing highlighting the advantages of such a 
move).  They argued that only a QIZ agreement between the 
United States and Turkey would permit companies to maintain 
their existing market share in the United States. 
 
5. (SBU) Producers noted that their overall woes are 
compounded by the strengthening Turkish lira and depreciating 
dollar.  Companies specializing in shipping to the U.S. are 
especially impacted, but they conceded that the overall 
sector is somewhat cushioned from by the fact that the lira\'s 
appreciation against the Euro has been less marked, but even 
there the Chinese renminbi\'s link to the dollar enhances 
China\'s competitiveness there. 
 
6. (SBU) Representatives of U.S. textile importers largely 
echoed these predictions about the impact of the elimination 
of quotas on Turkey.  Gap\'s Middle Eastern Representative 
Gulsun Cetin (whose husband Rusen is a senior IKTIB board 
member), told us her company sources nearly 10 percent of its 
annual 6.3 billion USD in procurement from the region (and 
290 million USD of that total from Turkey alone).  She sees 
Turkish textile exports to the United States declining by 
20-25 percent over the next three years.  She predicts that 
Turkey\'s exports to Europe will drop even more sharply, 
however-- by up to 50 percent over the same period, in part 
because she expects the U.S. to be more aggressive than 
Europe in adopting safeguard measures and in part because the 
value of Turkey\'s customs union position will diminish in the 
post-quota environment.  Cetin agreed that Turkey\'s 
disadvantage vis-a-vis the Far East stems not just from 
higher costs, but the difficulty purchasers have in 
implementing codes of conduct there.  But she also criticized 
Turkish companies for their failure to use the last few years 
to upgrade their manufacturing to the next level and move to 
higher value added production.  As a result, she said, Turkey 
has \"no competitive edge,\" and optimistic predictions about 
Turkey\'s ability to compete by both politicians and industry 
are divorced from reality. 
 
7. (SBU) As for the Gap itself, Cetin noted that she is 
shifting her firm\'s more mass market products (largely those 
targeted at Old Navy and Gap stores) to Egypt from Turkey. 
Some higher-end production, such as men\'s blazers, however, 
is moving here from Italy, given lower labor costs (18 USD 
per piece versus 48 in Italy).  Cetin noted that Turkey can 
move towards these higher end items, so that overall textile 
export values will not decline as substantially as will 
volumes.  But she still predicted wrenching economic 
dislocations, and agreed with Turkish manufacturers that it 
is not clear where in the economy those laid off from textile 
production will be able to go.  Other leading export sectors, 
such as automotive production, are less labor intensive, and 
also require more skilled labor.  The transition will require 
careful government management, our IKTIB interlocutors told 
us, something that has not occurred up to now. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: In contrast to their optimistic public face 
(a recent editorial in the Exporters\' Union magazine 
recounting a visit to China pointed out that country\'s 
shortcomings and opined that Turks should not be overly 
fearful of the threat it poses), in private industry leaders 
are much less sanguine.  We reiterated that discussion of 
QIZs with Turkey has always excluded the textile sector, and 
that even if Turkish QIZ\'s were to reemerge as a realistic 
possibility (something that does not now appear likely), this 
would remain the case.  IKTIB members, however, stressed that 
without some such \"privilege\" from the United States, Turkey 
is likely to lose significant market share, resulting in 
severe economic hardship and a potential \"social crisis.\" 
 
9.  (SBU)  Turkish industry is painting a decidedly more 
gloomy picture than external observers, like the WTO, IMF and 
investment bankers, all of whom have predicted a more limited 
impact.  It is also difficult to disentangle the impact of 
the end of quotas from exchange rate changes and more local 
factors (such as a 34 percent increase in the minimum wage 
earlier this year) that may be playing a part in the textile 
sector\'s loss of competitiveness.  Nonetheless, the Turkish 
textile industry, which thrived behind the barriers of the 
quota system, is clearly in transition.  The sector, while 
still large, is increasingly becoming less important to the 
Turkish economy: the share of textiles in total Turkish 
exports of goods has fallen from 39% in 1998 to 29% 
currently, while total exports grew by 125% (nominally) since 
1998.  We suspect that the industry is overplaying the 
downside of the end of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing 
to bolster their case for trade preferences.  Embassy Ankara 
plans to report views of GOT officials and Ankara-based 
business organizations on these issues septel.  End Comment.

1. (SBU) Summary: While acknowledging that the environment 
for religious minorities in Turkey has significantly improved 
over the past several years, leaders of several Istanbul 
Protestant churches claim that they continue to face legal 
hurdles and cultural prejudice in their activities.  Because 
their registration applications are routinely denied, delayed 
or ignored, the churches are forced to operate unofficially, 
with no legal guarantee to protect them from arbitrary 
closure.  Some Protestant leaders suspect that the lack of 
formal procedures for  the legal establishment of places of 
worship stems from the Turkish secular establishment\'s fear 
that this would open the way for the registration of 
thousands of illegal mosques.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Leaders of ten separate Protestant churches (most in 
Istanbul, but including one each from Izmir and Ankara) 
described their recent experiences to poloffs and conoff on 
December 2.  The Protestants claim that there are about 30 
churches in Istanbul with approximately 40 to 50 members in 
each congregation.  All operate unofficially, with the 
exception of the Istanbul Protestant Church Foundation, which 
successfully registered as a foundation in 1998 (Note: 
Subsequent legal changes requiring that new foundations have 
at least USD 600,000 in capital have effectively eliminated 
this as an option for other churches.  End Note). 
 
3. (SBU) Overall, the Protestant leaders conceded that the 
general atmosphere for their activities had improved over the 
last several years, albeit in \"baby steps.\"  They cited the 
following examples of harassment over the past year alone: 
 
- Although appropriate permits had been obtained from the 
local deputy governor, the Sisli Police obtained higher 
authority to force the River Church to suspend its weekly 
screening of a film about Jesus.  Claiming that they had 
received a bomb threat against the church, police searched 
the premises and suggested that they stop showing the film 
\"for their own protection.\" 
 
- Despite being contacted by Bayrampasa prison officials when 
foreign inmates requested Christian services and provisions, 
the River Church was denied permission to administer the 
services on the grounds that the church pastor is not a 
registered priest.  According to the pastor, however, he is 
an ordained minister and no Turkish authority ever asked to 
check his credentials. 
 
- Although they had obtained prior permission and there were 
no apparent protesters, police forced Alo Dua Church 
Protestants to stop distributing copies of the New Testament 
on Prince\'s Island, again claiming it was \"for their own 
protection.\" 
 
- In a separate incident, a group of Protestants was harassed 
by hostile bystanders in Taksim while distributing materials 
on New Year\'s Day.  Although permission had been obtained in 
advance, several police present failed to intervene, except 
to force the Protestants, rather than the hostile bystanders, 
to vacate the premises, again citing their security as the 
reason. 
 
- Church members traveled to a remote area in the Black Sea 
region for the baptism of four new members.  They claim that 
thirty gendarme showed up, made threatening remarks and 
forced them to leave. 
 
- Last month several congregations reported that outsiders 
distributed materials at their services published by an 
organization called Hakikat (reportedly linked with Turkish 
Hizbullah) threatening Turkish converts with violence if they 
don\'t convert back to Islam. 
 
4. (SBU) The Protestant leaders also shared stories about 
legal roadblocks they have faced over the past year: 
 
- The River Church applied for a permit to hold discussion 
groups about the movie \"The Passion.\"  Despite a 
constitutional right to assemble, the application was denied 
on the grounds that zoning laws in the requested area do not 
allow church discussion groups. 
 
- Church members were occasionally harassed, subjected to 
unreasonable delays, or denied outright when they sought to 
change their religion on their national ID cards.  One 
official simply refused to provide the necessary application 
forms; others were told they could not convert without a 
document from a registered church (Note: The only such 
churches are of other denominations, mostly Greek or Armenian 
Orthodox. End Note). 
- Most complained that their inability to officially register 
means that they cannot obtain Turkish residency or work 
permits.  The Turkish government requires individuals 
applying for residency to have at least USD 30,000 in Turkey, 
but residency permits are required to open bank accounts. 
Without such permits foreigners must leave the country every 
90 days, in order not to overstay their visas. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: Protestants appear to be free to worship in 
the privacy of their unregistered churches (usually 
residential or commercial office space), but when they seek 
to conduct outreach or other public activities, they 
routinely encounter official harassment and occasionally 
public prejudice.  The lack of established procedures to 
officially register the churches effectively denies the 
Protestant community any legal protection from official 
harassment and arbitrary closure.  Even the Istanbul 
Protestant Church Foundation has so far been unable to obtain 
the necessary zoning permits for its small church (Note: 
Current zoning regulations stipulate that places of worship 
be at least 2,500 square meters in size - a requirement that 
the church (and many mosques) fails to meet).  The reluctance 
of Turkish authorities to facilitate the registration of 
these churches may stem, in part, from the secular 
establishment\'s concern that such a precedent could lead to 
the legalization of thousands of uncontrolled, unregistered 
mesjits or mosques.

This cable was coordinated with Embassy Ankara 
 
1. (SBU) P/E Chief and Consular Section Chief met on December 
7 with H. Ismail Kaptanoglu Ship Management and Trading 
Company Managing Director Sadan Kaptanoglu and other company 
executives to review Coast Guard security concerns and 
possible action against the company.  While reiterating that 
the company had not received the Coast Guard\'s September 30 
warning letter until it was transmitted by the Foreign 
Ministry last week, Kaptanoglu stressed that the company 
understands the gravity of the situation, will fully 
implement the Coast Guard\'s requirements, and is 
\"brainstorming\" to determine other ways in which it can 
reduce the number of absconders and deserters leaving its 
ships.  She indicated that the company will prepare and send 
a letter to the Coast Guard to this effect on December 7. 
Clearly adding to the company\'s new found sense of urgency is 
concern over the planned call by a company vessel-- the H 
Cenk Kaptanoglu-- to Corpus Christi on December 20. 
 
2. (SBU) Kaptanoglu was joined by her Deputy General Manager, 
Muhsin Divan, her operations manager, Tansel Karademir, and 
the company\'s security officer, Raif Soylerkaya.  All 
expressed embarrassment about the company\'s current 
predicament, noting that the third generation company, which 
controls nearly 10 percent of Turkey\'s merchant marine, has 
been in business for over 100 years.  She noted that prior to 
the current series of exchanges through the Foreign Ministry, 
the company had been preparing a letter to the Coast Guard 
regarding the H Hasan Yardim incident, which she described as 
a real blow to the company because it had sought to have the 
appropriate security measures in place for the vessel\'s 
arrival in Baltimore.  She explained, however, that a delay 
in processing of the guards in the port resulted in their not 
reaching the vessel until after it had berthed, by which time 
a number of seamen had slipped away. 
 
3. (SBU) Kaptanoglu and her colleagues attributed the 
desertion and absconding problem to Turkey\'s economic 
problems, and also to the fact that it is difficult to find 
good seamen (and officers) in Turkey.  They had difficulty, 
however, in explaining why the problem has affected 
Kaptanoglu ships more than other vessels from Turkey, other 
than to speculate that because Kaptanoglu vessels engage in 
time-chartering rather than regular liner service, the 
pressures on crew members are more intense.  They noted that 
they have sought to build profiles of deserters to guide them 
in future crewing decisions, but this has not been helpful 
(half of those who jumped ship were married with children, 
half single).  They have also sought bonds and guarantees 
from sailors and their relatives (and are now pursuing the 
four November cases in Turkish court), but that this has also 
been ineffective.  In response to Consular Chief\'s 
observation that a pattern of absconding and deserting from 
Kaptanoglu ships (with seven incidents in 15 port calls over 
a two year period) could give rise to the impression that 
someone inside the company was acting as a facilitator, 
Kaptanoglu said she has had the same thought and is reviewing 
the company\'s crewing operation to ensure that this is not 
the case. 
 
4. (SBU) As a last resort, Kaptanoglu indicated that she is 
examining the possibility of solving the problem by 
reflagging the company\'s ships and using non-Turkish crews, 
but that she hopes to exhaust other measures first.  Her 
father (AK Deputy and Maritime Chamber Managing Council Head, 
Cengiz Kaptanoglu) and her uncle (who heads the Turkish 
Shipowners\' Association) would strongly resist such a move, 
she predicted.  Currently the company intends to contract 
with a single protective agency in the United States that 
will handle all security related issues related to 
Kaptanoglu\'s port calls.  Up to now, Kaptanoglu has worked 
with multiple agencies, which has resulted in coordination 
problems.  That company would ensure that armed guards meet 
the vessel in a timely fashion on December 20 and that they 
carry out all the measures required in the September 30 
letter. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: Kaptanoglu is clearly now seized with the 
gravity of our security concerns, and aware of the impact 
proposed measures will have on company operations.  Ms. 
Kaptanoglu promised that a letter to the Coast Guard 
outlining company actions would be dispatched within 24 
hours, and stressed that the company will fully abide by 
Coast Guard requirements.  End Comment.

1. (sbu) Summary: Following dominatig victories in the arch 
28 local elections, Justice and Development Party (AKP) 
officials in Istanbul have sought to furthr consolidate 
power by attracting converts from ther parties and have 
transferred key assets fro the few remaining non-AKP 
districts to areas uner thir conrol. The adersely 
affected mayors, ho alo compain tht the AKP-controlled 
greate municipality routinely discriminates against themin 
allocating investment for municipal projects,have challenged 
some of the new measures in cour.  Although tense relations 
between the city and hese districts will make life dfficult 
fo the andful of non-AKP mayors, mostenjoystrong 
political and economic support from teir relatively wealthy 
and educated constituents.  End Summary. 
 
2. (sbu) The Justice and Development Party (AKP) racked up an 
impressive list of victories in the March 28 local elections 
in Istanbul, taking approximately 45 percent of the total 
vote, winning the Istanbul mayorship, 69 percent of the seats 
on the Istanbul city council, and 24 of Istanbul\'s 32 
district mayorships.  The rare holdouts were Istanbul\'s 
wealthiest districts (Bakirkoy, Besiktas, Sisli, Kadikoy, and 
Avcilar), where majorities of the better educated and more 
secular populations elected Republican People\'s Party (CHP) 
mayors, while popular incumbent Motherland Party (ANAP) 
mayors managed to hold on in the Prince\'s Islands and 
Buyukcekmece (both relatively affluent summer resort areas, 
although Buyukcekmece now borders Istanbul\'s urban sprawl), 
as well as Catalca (rural, agriculture-intensive).  Since the 
elections, however, the ANAP district mayors for both the 
Prince\'s Islands and Catalca have abandoned their party and 
joined AKP. (Note: The chairman of the CHP city council 
group, who was at the iftar dinner attended by PM Erdogan and 
hosted by Istanbul Mayor Topbas where one of the mayors 
publicly switched parties, remarked to poloff that he thought 
it insulting and inappropriate to conduct this ceremony in 
the presence of local CHP and ANAP officials.  End Note). 
 
3. (sbu) Local mayors have complained to poloff that the 
AKP-controlled Istanbul city council has taken steps to 
consolidate the party\'s power at the expense of local mayors 
from other parties.  In Bakirkoy, the Istanbul city council 
has long eyed the profitable Hippodrome, or race track. 
Years earlier, measures were passed to ensure that taxes from 
off-track betting (there are hundreds of venues around the 
city) remain in the district where the bets are placed.  This 
year the city council passed a new measure expropriating 80 
percent of the race track\'s monthly USD 2 million on-site 
taxes to be distributed to other districts and the greater 
municipality.  With the Hippodrome accounting for 35 percent 
of Bakirkoy\'s total revenue, Unal Erzen, the CHP Bakirkoy 
district mayor, worries that he may have trouble making ends 
meet.  AKP Istanbul Chairman Mehmet Muezzinoglu told poloff 
that the Hippodrome belongs to all of Istanbul and that the 
city council would have followed through with these plans 
even if they also controlled Bakirkoy.  Erzen also complained 
that Bakirkoy is routinely overlooked by the Greater 
Municipality when it comes to large investments in 
transportation and infrastructure.  (Note: As one of the 
wealthier districts in Istanbul, Bakirkoy has enjoyed major 
investments in past years and faces few of the endemic 
problems of other, poorer districts.  End Note). 
 
4. (sbu) ANAP Buyukcekmece district mayor Hasan Akgun had 
similar complaints.  A significant portion of this district\'s 
revenue comes from taxes paid by businesses in the district\'s 
industrial area, one of the largest in Istanbul.  Several 
weeks ago, AKP used its majority in the Istanbul city council 
to separate the Buyukcekmece industrial area from that 
district and attach it instead to a neighboring region 
controlled by an AKP official.  Akgun has challenged the 
measure in court and trials are ongoing.  AKP Istanbul 
Chairman Muezzinoglu conceded that Akgun is \"10 percent 
right\" in his claims, but argued that the redistricting was 
part of a much larger effort to redraw local borders in a 
more rational manner.  Asked whether Buykcekmece continues to 
get a fair share of investment from the Istanbul Greater 
Municipality for public works projects, Akgun claimed that he 
has gotten \"nothing.\"  CHP Besiktas district mayor Ismail 
Unal, meanwhile, told poloff that relations with Istanbul 
Mayor Topbas are pleasant \"face-to-face,\" but that they get 
no real cooperation or follow-up outside of these meetings. 
 
5. (c) Comment: While AKP has clearly used its dominating 
position in the Istanbul city council to consolidate its 
control in Istanbul, it is unclear whether this is anything 
more than \"politics as usual.\"  We have also heard many 
(unconfirmed) rumors about local corruption going all the way 
to the highest levels in the AKP in Istanbul.  Some early 
assessments of Istanbul Mayor Kadir Topbas suggest that he is 
relatively ineffective; many of our contacts have suggested 
that real power lies instead with Vice Mayor Idris Gulluce 
and AKP Istanbul Chairman Muezzinoglu.  In the end, whether 
or not AKP is guilty of corruption or dirty politics, they 
will enjoy their dominating position in local politics for 
several years, but if they fail to deliver on people\'s 
expectations there will be nobody else to blame when voters 
go back to the polls in 2009.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, SOCI, TU, Istanbul 
SUBJECT: THE NEW EU? ARRANGING MARRIAGES ON TURKISH 
TELEVISION 
 
 
1. (u) Summary: With Turkey on the verge of receiving a 
historic invitation on December 17 to begin membership 
negotiations, Europe is seized with the question of whether 
Turkey is sufficiently \"European.\"  Religion and economic 
disparities aside, Turkish television provides a window into 
some key cultural differences.  Television fare here largely 
tracks with the offerings available in the U.S. and Europe -- 
romantic and dramatic serials, popstar competitions, 
melodramatic soap operas.  Over the past few years Turkey has 
also adopted the latest western television craze, reality 
television, but has given it a uniquely Turkish twist. End 
Summary. 
 
2. (u) According to Sinevizyon, the leading local producer of 
reality television programs, the trend started here with the 
wholesale adoption of the \"Big Brother\" format.  With only a 
few minor changes (installing private dressing rooms, 
single-sex bedrooms, and a few behavior rules), Sinevizyon 
has had five seasons of highly-rated programs.  The dating 
and marriage shows, however, have not translated into Turkish 
culture as easily.  Sinevizyon\'s Pelin Akat admitted that 
they bombed with a show based on supermodels and with another 
which tried to help couples resolve their interpersonal 
problems.  This season, however, Sinevizyon has scored their 
biggest hit, \"Will You Be My Bride?,\" by creating a radically 
different format. 
 
3. (u) In \"Bride,\" 5 mothers and 10 would-be daughters-in-law 
live in the same house (Big Brother-style -- very little 
privacy, on-screen 24 hours a day).  Each week the 
most-popular contestant (as determined by call-in votes) 
earns the right to vote off another.  Effectively, the 
mothers screen the daughters as potential brides for their 
sons, who live in a separate house and occasionally interact 
with the women, but have no real input in choosing their 
partners.  Instead of a prize check, contestants compete for 
100,000 euros in gold coins sitting on the coffee table of 
the studio house (Note: Such coins are traditional, 
ubiquitous wedding gifts in Turkey.  End Note). This is 
reality television Turkish-style. 
 
4. (u) The format has broad appeal in a society where a large 
percentage of couples are still matched by some form of 
arranged marriages or, at the very least, must seek parental 
approval for their fiances.  Turkish audiences particularly 
relate to the empowered, even domineering, mothers.  \"Mom, 
why did you vote off Aysegul? I love her!,\" asked one son. 
His mother responded, \"Love?! You don\'t know what love is! 
I\'ll tell you when you\'re in love.\"  Traditional Turkish 
society continues to put its sons on pedestals, leading 
audiences to sympathize with the girls who have trouble 
\"measuring up.\"  One of the mothers offered her more modest 
underwear to a girl wearing a g-string; the same girl later 
saw her reputation in the house plummet briefly when she was 
falsely accused of having previously worked as a belly 
dancer. 
 
5. (u) One of the most popular and successful television 
programs in Turkey\'s history, \"Bride\" will air its season 
finale on December 18.  Having racked up 30 percent daily 
ratings and as high as 50 percent on the weekend call-in vote 
episodes, \"Bride\" is the most widely-watched and discussed 
reality television show in Turkey to date. It is also showing 
on Turkish affiliates in Europe.  Although Sinevizyon has no 
details on viewership in Europe, they claim that a previous 
(and less successful) program which also allowed viewers in 
Europe to call in their votes recorded more votes from the 
European audience than it did from the audience in Turkey. 
 
6. (u) Comment: \"Bride\'s\" depiction of the Turkish family, 
the dominant role that mothers play, and the influence they 
wield over their children seems at odds with the more modern 
values common in Europe today.  Akat told us, however, that 
two major European reality television producers may soon 
purchase the rights to market similar formats in Europe. 
Perhaps American and European mothers are just as influential 
(albeit more subtle) in family life as Turkish mothers.  In 
any case, the EU may not have to wait for Turkey\'s accession 
to begin absorbing some of its values.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL ANALYSTS ON MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, 
OPTIMISTIC FOR 2005 
 
REF: ANKARA 7105 
 
1. (u) Summary: Istanbul market analysts were not surprised 
at the relatively moderate size of the post-EU decision 
rally, because they believe that much of the good news had 
already been priced into the markets during the last few 
months.  They expect, however, that interest in Turkish 
financial markets will increase beginning early next year, 
as Turkey attracts a broader base of global investors.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (u) Bender Securities\' Murat Gulkan told Econ Specialist 
that the already upbeat bond market welcomed the Central 
Bank\'s rate cut. He noted that Turkish Lira (TL) bond rates 
dropped by close to 2 percentage points in two working days 
on Friday and Monday.  Murat Cetinkaya, Head of Treasury for 
Diler Yatirim Bank, told us that fears of a possible crisis 
in Brussels had contributed to lira weakness in recent 
weeks.  The lira\'s appreciation on Monday, Cetinkaya 
explained, merely brought the rate back to its level from 
two weeks ago against the Euro-dollar basket. 
 
3. (u) Both Gulkan and Cetinkaya expect more intensive 
foreign investor trading following the Christmas and New 
Year holidays. With many investors preparing to close out 
their 2004 books, they are likely to wait until January 
before taking significant new positions.  Cetinkaya said he 
believes that most of the dollar supply came from local 
banks taking their positions before the foreigners come 
back.  Gulkan said a big-ticket corporate transaction such 
as Telsim (mobile telephone company), Star (media group), or 
one of the big banks might also trigger high volume F/X 
flows early next year.  Looking ahead at the coming year, 
Murat Ucer, an analyst for Eurosource who has generally been 
a voice of caution, told us that he expects macroeconomic 
stability throughout the coming year, although growth may 
slow considerably. 
 
4. (u) Comment: Istanbul-based (and some London-based) 
financial analysts believe that the December 17 EU decision 
will put Turkey on the radar screens of the big global 
funds, attracting a broader base of global investors than 
has been the case up until now.  Equity markets of Turkey\'s 
Eastern European competitors are already expensive, with the 
Czech Republic showing a 72 percent increase this year, 
Hungary 66 percent, and Poland 25 percent. The EU news, 
coupled with the Central Bank\'s long-awaited decisions to 
cut borrowing rates, resume F/X purchase auctions, and adopt 
inflation targeting, has left analysts bullish on prospects 
for 2005.

1. (sbu) Summary: In trying to burnish ruling AKP\'s religious 
tolerance credentials, Prime Minister Erdogan attended the 
December 5 opening of a museum at an Armenian Hospital in 
Istanbul and four days later presided over the opening 
ceremony for a new  mosque-church-synagogue complex near 
Antalya.  Both the Armenian Patriarch and Chief Rabbi 
accepted invitations to join the PM in Antalya.  Members of 
the Armenian, Jewish, and Protestant communities, however, 
characterized the appearances as \"window dressing\" designed 
merely to put on a show for the EU about Turkey\'s religious 
tolerance and harmony.  End Summary. 
 
Museum of Brotherhood 
--------------------- 
2. (u) Founded in 1832 with the permission of Sultan Mahmud 
II, the Surp Pirgic Hospital in Yedikule is one of four 
active Armenian hospitals in Istanbul.  PM Erdogan attended 
the December 5 opening ceremony to commemorate the hospital\'s 
newly-renovated museum space that exhibits drawings and 
photographs, religious garments, and antique medical 
equipment and furniture.  Dubbed the \"Museum of Brotherhood\" 
for the occasion, the small museum focuses on the history of 
the hospital and the Istanbul Armenian community, avoiding 
the sensitive subject of the 1915-6 massacres and deportation 
of Armenians living elsewhere in the country.  The PM\'s 
attendance turned the minor event into a gala occasion with 
thousands of guests and luminaries in attendance.  (Note: 
Poloff particularly noted the slick media kits and public 
relations efforts directed at foreign diplomats and media 
representatives.  End Note).  The PM\'s speech was replete 
with paeans to the shared history and culture of Turks and 
Armenians (\"As the children of this country, we have lived 
together in peace and security for centuries.  Our writers, 
architects, human values, trade, folksongs, and cuisines have 
mixed...\"). 
 
Garden of Religions 
------------------- 
3. (u) In a similar public display on December 8, PM Erdogan 
presided over the opening ceremony of a new 
mosque-church-synagogue complex near the Mediterranean city 
of Antalya in the tourist resort area of Belek.  The opening 
of the new complex appears to be a direct response to 
European and human rights critics who have chastised Turkey 
for not allowing any new churches, even in areas where 
increasing numbers of foreigners have settled.  The leaders 
of the religious communities in Istanbul were invited to 
participate in the opening of the new \"Garden of Religions,\" 
and both the Armenian Patriarch and Turkey\'s Chief Rabbi 
featured prominently in the news coverage and photographs. 
Echoing comments he also made at the hospital, PM Erdogan 
remarked that \"nobody who sees (this)... will be able to 
ignore this country\'s identity.\" 
 
What They Really Think... 
------------------------- 
4. (c) Members of the minority religious communities in 
Turkey were quick to belittle the developments.  Speaking at 
a December 10 Istanbul conference, Turgay Ucal of the Turkish 
Presbyterian Church characterized the \"Garden\" as mere 
\"window dressing\" and \"show\" for the EU in advance of the 
December 17 European Council summit.  Hrant Dink, editor of 
the Armenian weekly AGOS, told poloff that while the PM\'s 
visit to the hospital was important to the Armenian 
community, he doubted whether these events signified any kind 
of meaningful shift in policy on outstanding religious 
freedom issues.  Moreover, we have heard other blunt voices 
of criticism from within the Armenian community in Istanbul. 
For instance, the Deputy Director of Surp Pirgic Hospital, 
who is seen as a \"useful fool\" for the Turkish state by 
members of the community exasperated by his attempts to cover 
up the community\'s difficulties with officialdom, was slammed 
for using the opening of the museum to curry favor with the 
authorities.  Lina Filiba, VP of the Jewish Community, 
admitted that the Chief Rabbi had felt compelled to go 
Antalya, but that the community had refused to donate a torah 
and had no plans to send rabbis to perform services in the 
new \"show\" synagogue.  Finally, according to the daily 
newspaper Milliyet, Father Alphonse Sammut, who attended the 
ceremony in Antalya, claimed that \"as long as the rights of 
Catholics (to open churches) are not recognized, the 
religious mosaic that we hope for will not be possible.\" 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew\'s notable absence in 
Antalya, despite also being invited, was a clear sign that he 
was reluctant to be used in a photo opportunity so soon after 
the \"ecumenical\" furor during the Archons visit (ref A). 
 
Comment 
------- 
5. (c) Erdogan used both events to try to deflect criticism 
and put a positive spin on Turkey\'s record of ethnic and 
religious tolerance.  Nobody we spoke to in the Christian and 
Jewish communities harbored any illusions that this was 
anything but an effort to influence the upcoming December 17 
European Council decision on Turkey\'s EU membership 
application.  What will demonstrate true tolerance will be 
the acceptance on the part of the AKP leadership, grassroots, 
and Turkish society in general that Christians, Jews and 
others who are not Muslims are as much Turks as anyone else, 
and that they have the right to worship and proselytize to 
the same extent as Muslims.

SUBJECT: ISTANBUL ORGANIZATIONS ADDRESS STREET CHILDREN AND 
INCREASE IN PICKPOCKETING 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Pickpocketing incidents, particularly those 
involving cellular telephones, have risen sharply throughout 
Turkey in 2004, with the highest jump in Istanbul.   National 
attention following an incident leading to the death of a 
student in Istanbul in November prompted the formation of a 
ministerial commission, increased security and greater 
punishments for pickpocketing.  Government officials 
attribute the growth in pickpocketing to poor economic 
conditions leading to immigration from eastern and 
southeastern Turkey, and an increase in street children 
coming from broken families.   Incidents continue, one 
resulting in the arrest in Istanbul of a group of youths from 
Diyarbakir in early December.  State Minister Aksit predicted 
the number of street children in Istanbul could rise to 
625,000.  Istanbul security officials contend that they do 
not have sufficient funding to do more than arrest leaders of 
groups of child criminals.  Organizations such as the 
Istanbul Social Services Directorate and NGOs addressing the 
street children issue contend that pickpocketing is related 
more to organized crime, and should be dealt with separately 
from the increase in street children.   End summary. 
 
Istanbul Pickpocketing Incident draws National Attention 
 
2. (U) There were 11,886 pickpocketing incidents throughout 
Turkey in the first nine months of 2004, an increase of 23 
per cent nation-wide, compared to 9700 in the first nine 
months of 2003.   The incidents in Istanbul alone numbered 
6000 in the first nine months of 2004, a 60 per cent increase 
over the comparable period in 2003.   The death of a 
university student thrown from a train near Haydarpasha in 
November by a group of youths who stole the student,s 
cellular phone drew national attention to the rise of 
pickpocketing and the related increase of street children. 
Three youths were arrested in connection with the death of 
the student, who was returning to his home in Istanbul via 
the express train after classes at a university in Izmit. 
The father of one of the youths arrested admitted that he 
forced his two middle-school aged children to work to 
contribute to the family budget, so his son started to sell 
pismaniye (a sweet special to Izmit) on the train, but he had 
fallen in with a bad group of friends. 
 
3. (U) In response to public outcry after the incident, the 
Council of Ministers formed a commission consisting of four 
ministers (State Minister Aksit, Interior Minister Aksu, 
Education Minister Celik and Health Minister Akdogan) to 
research the causes of pickpocketing and the related issue of 
street children.   After the first meeting of the commission, 
Aksit called the cause of the problem totally economic: 47 
per cent came from the east and southeastern Anatolia; 42 per 
cent had left primary school; 49 per cent came from broken 
families; and 53 per cent had been exposed to violence. 
Deputy General Director of Security, Ramazan Er, who 
announced that additional police have been assigned to trains 
to curb pickpocketing incidents, echoed Aksit, attributing 
the cause to the immigration of families with many children 
from rural areas to large cities, along with the separation 
of the parents, who encourage their children to commit 
crimes.   Er also announced that the punishment for these 
pickpocketing crimes would increase from three to seven years 
in the new Turkish Punishment Law coming into effect April 1, 
2005.   The Supreme Court also placed the crime of cellular 
telephone robberies within the category of extortion, and 
increased the punishment for those indicted of extortion from 
10 to 20 years. 
 
4. (U) According to the last census, Aksit announced that 
625,000 children in Istanbul are at risk of becoming street 
children.  Aksit added that 95 per cent of children working 
in the streets are male, and that the working children issue 
should be addressed separately from children living in the 
streets.   Based on the Security Directorate\'s 2003 estimate 
of 88,313 street children addicted to drugs and involved with 
crime, Aksit noted that 15 per cent of these children are age 
10 and under, and 85 per cent are between 11 and 18 years 
old.   44 per cent of these children are addicted to 
cigarettes and other substances, and of this 4 percent are 
addicted to alcohol, 2 per cent to paint thinner, 2 per cent 
to glue, and 2 per cent to narcotics. 
 
5. (U) In November 2004, some Belgian tourists in Istanbul 
were injured by a group of young glue addicts in Cihangir 
demanding money, and an Israeli tourist in Istanbul was also 
attacked by glue sniffers.   The number of street children in 
Istanbul who are addicted to easily-obtainable inhalants such 
as glue and paint thinner is apparently increasing, and some 
may commit crimes such as pickpocketing on an individual 
basis.  However, Istanbul Governorate social services and NGO 
officials believe that child glue addicts who commit crimes 
are generally not controlled by organized crime, as they do 
not produce a flow of money.  These officials insist that the 
street children problem must be dealt with separately from 
the rise in pickpocketing, which is generally committed by 
professionals controlled by mafia groups. 
 
Child Crime in Istanbul on the Rise... 
 
6. (U)  Statistics from the Istanbul Children\'s Crime 
division from January 1 - May 15, 2004 revealed that 5,569 
children in Istanbul during that period were apprehended by 
police and accused of committing 4,285 different crimes. 
4,740 of those apprehended were released by the court and 
returned to their families, 289 were sent back to their 
countries, and 395 were sent to prison.   192 were accused of 
pickpocketing theft; 310 of robbery, 546 of wounding others, 
394 of fighting, and 131 of driving without a license. 
Interestingly, of the children aged 11 years and under 
accused of robbery, 191 were girls and 41 boys. 
 
...but Limited Funds to Deal with Child Criminals 
 
7. (SBU) Although National Security officials increased 
punishments for the crimes, limited financial resources for 
Istanbul security districts are preventing implementation of 
policies to address the increase in pickpocketing.  Beyoglu 
Police Chief Gedik informed ARSO that he has stationed teams 
of plainclothes police officers and additional uniformed 
police in the Istiklal area to deal with increased crimes by 
gangs of children.   Gedik had made a proposal to the 
Istanbul Chief of Police to develop a national program to 
deal with gangs of children who commit pickpocketing and 
other crimes, but was informed there were no funds for such a 
program.   Gedik also said that beyond arresting and 
incarcerating several of the leaders of the gangs of street 
children, he did not have the authority or resources to 
combat the ongoing activities of the child criminals. 
Reacting to public pressure about pickpocketing and street 
children, Gedik began to round up children in his district 
and transfer them to the Beykoz district, the responsibility 
of the Jandarma, who Gedik is convinced have more resources 
to address the problem. 
 
Amcit Pickpocketing incidents centered in Taksim 
 
8. (U) Istanbul ACS unit advises that the locus of 
pickpocketing reported by American citizens has moved in 2004 
from the tourist center of Sultan Ahmet to the business and 
nightclub area in Taksim -- in the Beyoglu district. 
However, there have thankfully been virtually no violent 
incidents involving Americans in Istanbul over the past two 
years in connection with pickpocketing. 
 
Social Services and NGOs Address Street Children Problem 
 
9. (SBU) While the government ministers and security 
officials are convinced that the increase in street children 
is a primary cause of the surge in pickpocketing incidents, 
both municipal government officials and NGO directors assert 
that the two issues are separate. Fevzi Yirtik, director of 
the Istanbul Governorate,s Social Services Division, which 
operates eight shelters for street children in Istanbul, 
contends that most of the children in his shelters are not 
involved in crime, and that it is important to distinguish 
between street children and children involved in crimes such 
as pickpocketing.   Yusuf Ahmet Kulca, Director of the Umut 
Cocuklar Dernegi (Association for Hope for Children), 
believes that the pickpocketers are controlled by different 
mafia groups, and attributes the rise in pickpocketing to the 
annual influx of approximately 300,000 immigrants from 
eastern and southeastern Turkey to Istanbul. 
 
10. (SBU) Both the social services directorate and the NGO 
deal with children from broken homes, due to divorce, 
violence and abuse, and their goal is to reunite the children 
with their families.  Pediatricians and other experts in both 
organizations work together to rehabilitate the children. 
The Social Services Directorate, which has addressed the 
problem of street children since 1998, deploys teams 
monitoring the streets to look for children who should be 
brought to the shelters, but will not do so by force.  The 
governorate,s 8 shelters have a capacity of 250, but 
currently there are approximately 150-200 children in the 
shelters, between the ages of 8 and 18, after which the state 
is not responsible.  The shelters have an open-door policy 
for the children, so that they can come and go whenever they 
want.  Yirtik claims his directorate has not had a problem 
with funding, and has been successful in reuniting one-third 
of the children with their families.   However, as many 
involved in pickpocketing incidents are between age 18 and 
25, the social services directorate,s ability to reduce 
street crime for children over 18 is limited. 
 
11. (SBU) The Hope for Children Association, one of 14 NGOs 
in Istanbul dealing with street children, works with children 
from age 7 to 27, 7 per cent of whom are girls.   The 
Association,s single shelter in Bakirkoy has a capacity of 
50, but currently is housing 35-40 children.   The NGO has 
developed vocational projects to encourage children to stay 
off the streets, including working in a laundry service.  The 
Association is supported only by private donations -- one of 
their facilities was donated by Philip Morris -- and depends 
on volunteers, including medical staff.  Director Kulca 
complained that they have recently had to cut staff severely 
and cancel a project due to lack of funding. 
 
12. (SBU) Comment: A continuing flow of immigrants from the 
east and insufficient funding handicap the ability of 
municipal, security and NGO organizations to deal with the 
growing numbers of street children and the increase in child 
crime.  A city-wide effort to combat these problems, 
including greater cooperation between security officials and 
social organizations in Istanbul, is needed to reduce the 
increase in pickpocketing and the involvement of children in 
street crime.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EU, TU, Istanbul, EU Accession 
SUBJECT: TURKEY GETS A DATE FROM THE EU, ISTANBUL REACTS 
 
 
1. (u) Summary: The December 17 EU decision to begin 
membership negotiations with Turkey in October 2005 was 
greeted in Istanbul with a mixture of relieved satisfaction 
and lingering skepticism.  Following the initial euphoria 
after the decision was announced, some Turks in academic 
circles already have begun to air their concerns and 
reservations about the qualifying language and conditions. 
Others, meanwhile, recognize the need to begin preparing for 
a long and difficult negotiating process and to downplay 
public expectations for what EU membership will mean for 
Turkey.  End Summary. 
 
\"Full Membership\" or Nothing At All... 
 
2. (sbu) Frustrated by decades of rejection and a sense of 
having been wronged on the Cyprus issue, many we spoke to in 
the days leading up to the December 17 decision were prepared 
to reject anything other than a \"fair\" invitation.  Istanbul 
Muncipal Housing Construction Director Ismet Yildirim, who 
claims to be close to the Prime Minister, openly told poloff 
that he hoped the offer would be rejected. \"What do we need 
the EU for anyway?\" he added.  Even some secular types who 
have long supported EU membership and opposed the ruling AKP 
admitted that they would fully support PM Erdogan if he felt 
compelled to reject a sub-standard offer.  Views here seem to 
have been influenced by the ruling AKP\'s tough rhetoric in 
the weeks before December 17.  Asked what would constitute a 
\"fair\" invitation, Turks here listed: 1) a specific starting 
date for negotiations in 2005; 2) negotiations for \"full\" 
membership, not some sort of special status or restricted 
membership; and 3) no preconditions on Cyprus.  Cyprus, in 
particular, seems to have been the most emotional issue. 
Educated Turks here invariably conceded that Turkey would 
\"eventually\" have to recognize Cyprus if it hoped to join the 
EU as a fellow member, but none of them was willing to accept 
such recognition as a pre-condition for negotiations. 
 
Exasperation and Suspicion Make (Some) Room for Euphoria, 
Pride, Relief 
 
3. (u) Following the initial euphoric reaction to the 
decision, we engaged a range of contacts for their views. 
Despite some qualifying language in the text of the decision 
and ongoing debate in academic circles, those we spoke with 
by and large accepted the December 17 decision as a victory 
for Turkey and the AKP government.  Even those who voted 
against AKP in the November 2002 elections admitted that they 
never would have imagined that AKP could deliver on their EU 
promises.  Cigdem Nas, a professor at the EU Institute of 
Marmara University, told poloff that the decision was not a 
surprise, but merely the latest step in a process that has 
lasted over 40 years and left most Turks with \"EU fatigue.\" 
Exasperated by the process, Turks here nevertheless feel 
relieved and proud that Turkey is finally on the verge of 
beginning negotiations.  They have suspected for years that 
the EU has been leading them on and raising the bar; many 
believed that this day would never come.  Despite the 
decision, in fact, suspicion remains.  Many are still 
convinced the EU will use Cyprus, negotiatin delays, or some 
other means to prevent Turkey fom ever joining the EU. 
 
A Pyrrhic Victory of ou Minds? 
 
4. (u) Such suspicions continue to fueldebate amongst more 
informed observers over wheter the decision was a victory at 
all.  Noting that he was saddened by the inappropriate 
\"carnival\" atmosphere that greeted the decision and deeply 
worried about some of the qualifying language and conditions 
(particularly on Cyprus), former ANAP FM Bozer told a Kadir 
Has University audience that \"it was a victory of our minds, 
but not our hearts.\"  Can Baydaroglu, former VP of the 
Turkey-Europe Foundation, echoed Bozer\'s concerns, 
specifically singling out the onerous new requirements that 
the 31 EU chapters be negotiated sequentially (rather than 
simultaneously) and that the EU Council separately approve 
the closing of each chapter.  Although the government has 
promised to restart the Cyprus negotiations, few here are 
hopeful that a solution can be found before Turkey is due to 
begin negotiations in October 2005.  An NTV journalist summed 
up a widely-shared view when she remarked that \"what little 
leverage there was on the Greek Cypriots was lost when the EU 
accepted them as a candidate at the 2002 Copenhagen Summit.\" 
Opinions differ, however, on whether Turkey should sign the 
Ankara Protocol (thereby implicitly recognizing Cyprus) in 
the absence of an agreement, even if failure to do so would 
jeopardize Turkey\'s EU prospects. 
 
Preparing for the Tough Slog Ahead 
 
5. (sbu) Even as Ankara puts together its negotiating team, 
several Istanbul universities and NGOs are planning 
conferences and public awareness campaigns to prepare Turkish 
public opinion for the negotiation process.  Former Finance 
Minister and Turkey-Europe Foundation President Ziya 
Muezzinoglu admitted to poloff that the negotiations will be 
difficult and that several groups in Turkey will suffer as a 
result.  While Muezzinoglu and others have argued to us that 
Turkey has a head-start given its participation in the EU 
Customs Union, most admit that Turkey will have difficulty in 
negotiations on several chapters, especially agriculture, 
finance, environment, and free movement of people.  Cigdem 
Nas remarked that the EU is also likely to become a scapegoat 
on a range of subjects, even though many of the reforms would 
have been necessary in any case.  Nationalists and other 
groups opposed to EU membership have already indicated to us 
that they will take advantage of this difficult transitional 
period to push for a \"Eurasian\" or Middle East alternative. 
Yusuf Cevahir, VP of the MUSIAD business association and 
Chairman of the Cevahir Group, for example, lamented to 
poloff the economic opportunities that Turkey would forego by 
choosing the EU over expanded ties with the Middle East. 
 
Are We Worthy? 
 
6. (u) Oddly, even as Turks here take pride in finally 
getting a negotiation date, there is a strong sense among 
some Istanbul Turks of all social classes that Turkey does 
not actually \"deserve\" to be in the EU.  Few would admit it 
openly to foreigners, but amongst themselves many Turks here 
strongly doubt whether their country will ever develop to the 
level of EU norms.  They constantly cite excessive traffic, 
the poor state of roads, petty corruption, sub-standard 
public services, even bad manners and a penchant for doing 
things at the last minute as examples of how Turkey is not 
ready to join the EU.  \"How are we ever going to be in Europe 
with this?\" has become a common refrain for frustrated Turks 
throughout Istanbul.  We overheard a taxi driver remark 
recently, \"Look at this (traffic)!  If they let us in, we\'ll 
just screw up the whole EU.\" 
 
7. (sbu) Comment: As the initial euphoria wears off, there is 
a growing sense here that December 17 was not the finish 
line, but merely another (albeit large) obstacle on the long 
road to EU membership.  Cyprus still looms large as a 
potential deal-breaker if a comprehensive, or at least 
face-saving solution, can\'t be found by next October.  Many 
here continue to suspect, moreover, that the EU will forever 
dangle membership as an unattainable \"carrot\" to motivate 
Turkish good behavior.  Nevertheless, Turks here have now 
begun to focus on the difficult negotiations ahead and the 
equally difficult task of managing the Turkish public\'s 
expectations during the process.

1. (SBU) Summary: On December 27, poloff met with Osman 
Kaplan, Deputy Director of the Foreigners Unit of the 
Istanbul Police Department, to follow up on trafficking in 
persons issues raised during the visit of a Moldavan anti-TIP 
government delegation (ref B) and the murder of a Belarusian 
woman in Istanbul (ref c). Kaplan said there is a growing 
awareness about the TIP problem in Turkey, and that in 
November five traffickers were apprehended in Istanbul, of 
whom three are in jail.  He shared documents about the 
Belarusian case; four men have been arrested and jailed in 
connection with the death.  Kaplan clarified the different 
situations of women described as trafficked; some come 
voluntarily, and some are tricked; many are unwilling to 
testify against traffickers.  Kaplan complained that the 
Moldovan delegation accused the Turkish Police of cooperating 
with the traffickers, increasing tension in the meeting. End 
summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Poloff and pol specialist met December 27 with Osman 
Kaplan, Deputy Director of the Foreigners Unit of the 
Istanbul Police Department, to follow up on trafficking in 
persons issues raised during the visit of a Moldavan anti-TIP 
government delegation (ref B) and the murder of a Belarusian 
woman in Istanbul in the fall.  Kaplan underlined that he was 
unable to provide information to U.S. diplomats in Istanbul 
on cases involving nationals from third countries -- such as 
Moldova or Belarus -- without official permission from the 
Ankara Headquarters of the Foreigners Unit. However, Kaplan 
shared information both about the growing TIP problem in 
Turkey and the Belarusian case. 
 
3. (SBU) Kaplan said there is a growing awareness about the 
TIP problem in Turkey, adding that more serious measures have 
been taken to address TIP after the 2002 amendment to the 
Turkish Penal Code, which specified the definition of human 
trafficking. As an example, Kaplan confirmed that in November 
2004 five traffickers were apprehended and sent to court; 
three of the traffickers are already in jail. 
 
4. (SBU) Kaplan stressed that women who may come under the 
definition of trafficked come to Turkey for many different 
reasons.  Some come voluntarily to make money; a woman, for 
example, can make USD 100 a night in Istanbul, versus USD 
30-50 a month in Moldova or Belarus.  Another group of women 
are cheated by traffickers.  He gave an example of a Moldovan 
woman who came to Turkey years ago and married a Turkish man; 
she is now a Turkish citizen.  She frequently travels to 
Moldova to recruit young women by promising them various 
jobs, such as dancing or babysitting, and forces them into 
prostitution once they are in Turkey.  Kaplan noted that the 
women are fearful of being sold.  He added that the Istanbul 
police have found that in most cases, the women are often 
unwilling to testify against the traffickers both because 
they are afraid of reprisal, and because they want to be able 
to return to Turkey. 
 
5. (SBU) On the murder of the Belarusian woman, Kaplan showed 
copies both of the police report and a November 3 article 
describing the case, in which a 27-year old Belarusian woman, 
Vera Krivenia, was tricked into coming to Istanbul by two 
Turkish men with promise of a job.  The two men took her 
passport, locked her in a house in Bakirkoy and forced her 
into prostitution. According to the documentation Kaplan 
shared, Krivenia and another Russian woman were then sent to 
the apartment of two businessmen, where she committed suicide 
by throwing herself out of the sixth-floor bathroom window in 
order to avoid being a prostitute.  Kaplan confirmed that the 
police arrested and sent to prison four Turkish men in 
connection with Krivenia\'s death: the two men who brought 
Krivenia to Turkey to force her into prostitution, and the 
two businessmen. 
 
6. (SBU) Turning to the November meeting of the Moldovan TIP 
delegation with the Istanbul police (ref c), Kaplan 
complained about the attitude of the Moldovan authorities, 
calling their approach unprofessional.  Kaplan claimed that 
the Moldovan delegation accused the Turkish Police of 
cooperating with the traffickers, increasing tension in the 
meeting.  He had to warn the interpreter not to interpret all 
the statements of the Moldovans, in order to prevent the 
Foreigners Unit director from leaving the meeting.  Kaplan 
added that the GOT has problems with the Moldovans entering 
the country.  For example, it is easy to change passports and 
names in Moldova, making it very easy for a Moldovan to 
return to Turkey even though his or her entry is banned.

7. (SBU) Kalan complained about the heavy work load and lack 
of resources, both personnel and fiancal inth 
Foreigners\' Unit, where te rng ofisue icludes work 
permits to illegal immgraio, TP,and visa violations. 
Kaplan stated that in November, 1000 foreigners were deported 
from Istanbul.  He believes that a separate Immigration 
Office is needed to ease the burden on the Foreigners\' Unit. 
 
8. (SBU) Bio Note: Kaplan, who graduated from the Ankara 
Police Academy in 1991, spent a year in the U.S., on an 
exchange program in the District of Columbia and Virginia 
police stations.  He served in the Ankara police bureau from 
1992-95, then transferred to Istanbul, where he is deputy 
head of the Foreigners\' Unit.   Kaplan has also worked in UN 
teams in Bosnia and Kosovo, and is comfortable with English.
