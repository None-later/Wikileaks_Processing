POPE CALLS WORLD\'S CARDINALS TO ROME

2.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS ORDERED ALL THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S 
CARDINALS TO ROME IN MAY TO DISCUSS POLICY ISSUES. CALLED AN 
EXTRAORDINARY CONSISTORY, THE MAY 21-24 MEETING WILL ANALYZE 
THE WAY THE POPE EXERCISES HIS AUTHORITY AND HOW THE WORLD\'S 
BISHOPS SHARE IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. 
VATICAN WATCHERS SUGGEST THE MEETING MIGHT ALSO ADDRESS THE 
STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND OTHER 
CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN THE HOPE OF RE-ESTABLISHING FULL 
UNITY. POPE JOHN PAUL HAS REGULARLY INSISTED ON THE PRIORITY 
OF CHRISTIAN UNITY. AN EVENTUAL \"RE-PHRASING\" BY THE WORLD\'S 
CARDINALS OF HOW PAPAL AUTHORITY IS EXERCISED MAY MAKE IT 
LESS OF A PROBLEM FOR OTHER CHRISTIAN CHURCHES, ESPECIALLY 
THE ORTHODOX, TO ACCEPT.

DETERIORATING SITUATION ON THE MIDDLE EAST.\" A STATEMENT 
RELEASED BY THE VATICAN SAID MOSLEM REPRESENTATIVES JOINED 
ITS OWN DELEGATION IN CALLING FOR AN END TO THE ISRAELI- 
PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY IN \"UNJUSTLY OCCUPIED\" 
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. THE JOINT STATEMENT AFFIRMED THE 
SPECIAL CHARACTER OF JERUSALEM AS SACRED TO ALL THREE 
MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONS, AND CONDEMNED BREACHES OF THE 
PRINCIPLE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, PARTICULARLY THE BLOCKING OF 
ACCESS TO THE HOLY PLACES.

PAPAL APPEAL FOR AFGHANISTAN 
---------------------------- 
 
4.   POPE JOHN PAUL II APPEALED TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY ON BEHALF OF DROUGHT AND CIVIL WAR VICTIMS IN 
AFGHANISTAN. AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS FEBRUARY 28 GENERAL 
AUDIENCE IN VATICAN CITY, THE POPE DECLARED THAT \"A GRAVE 
HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY IS OCCURRING IN AFGHANISTAN.\" HE SAID 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, THE SICK AND THE 
ELDERLY, WERE DYING OF HUNGER AND COLD. THE POPE EXPRESSED 
HIS APPRECIATION FOR THE EFFORTS OF HUMANITARIAN 
ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN THE REGION. HE APPEALED TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY \"NOT TO FORGET THIS TRAGIC 
SITUATION,\" AND URGED ALL PARTIES IN \"A WAR WHICH HAS BEEN 
TOO LONG AND BLOODY\" TO ARRANGE AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE TO 
ALLOW AID TO REACH PEOPLE MOST AT RISK.

5.   PATRIARCH RAPHAEL BIDAWID OF BAGHDAD DECLARED THAT 
RENEWED BOMBINGS OF MILITARY TARGETS BY US AND BRITISH 
AIRCRAFT COULD PUSH SADDAM HUSSEIN \"TO RETALIATE OUT OF 
DESPERATION.\" IN AN FEBRUARY 25 INTERVIEW WITH VATICAN NEWS 
AGENCY \"FIDES,\" BIDAWID OPINED THAT \"THE WHOLE OF THE ARAB 
WORLD IS NOW AGAINST THE AMERICANS AND THE BRITISH, AND 
READY TO COMMIT VIOLENCE AGAINST THE USA AND BRITAIN IN 
THEIR OWN COUNTRIES.\" THE PATRIARCH SAID THAT THE MORE 
SADDAM HUSSEIN IS \"MALTREATED\", THE GREATER THE SUPPORT HE 
RECEIVES FROM ORDINARY IRAQIS. BIDAWID CALLED FOR A \"SERIOUS 
DIALOGUE\" AND DECLARED THAT AIR STRIKES WOULD ONLY LEAD TO 
MORE VIOLENCE. ACCORDING TO THE CATHOLIC LEADER, WESTERNERS 
DO NOT APPRECIATE THE ARAB MENTALITY AND THAT IF AN ARAB\'S 
DIGNITY IS OFFENDED \"HE WILL BE AS FEROCIOUS AS A LION.\" 
BIDAWID SAID \"IT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE\" THAT 
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS DIRECTED AT IRAQ HAVE NOT WEAKENED SADDAM 
HUSSEIN\'S CONTROL OVER THE COUNTRY.

--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
6.   UKRAINE\'S NEWLY CREATED CARDINAL LUBOMYR HUSAR WANTS TO 
\"REASON WITH\" HIS ORTHODOX CHURCH COUNTERPARTS WHO OBJECT TO 
A PAPAL VISIT IN JUNE. SPEAKING AT A FEBRUARY 22 PRESS 
CONFERENCE IN VATICAN CITY, HUSAR SAID CATHOLICS IN UKRAINE 
HAVE THE SAME CULTURE, HISTORY, CHURCH STRUCTURE, THEOLOGY 
AND DISCIPLINE AS THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. HUSAR ACKNOWLEDGED 
THE TENSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ORTHODOX CHURCH LEADERS BUT SAID 
THE SITUATION \"IS NOT A STALEMATE.\" ACCORDING TO THE 
CARDINAL, THERE ARE TWO COMPLICATING FACTORS. THE FIRST IS 
THE GROWING STRENGTH OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN UKRAINE, 
WHICH AFTER YEARS OF COMMUNIST REPRESSION IS \"REBOUNDING 
WITH VIGOROUS HEALTH\" AND IS ACCUSED BY THE ORTHODOX OF 
COMPETING FOR SOULS.  SECONDLY, HUSAR SAID, THE ORTHODOX 
LEADERSHIP IS SPLINTERED AND THE MOSCOW PATRIARCHATE FEARS 
THAT A PAPAL VISIT MIGHT LEND CREDIBILITY TO ORTHODOX 
LEADERS OTHER THAN THE ONES BACKED BY MOSCOW. (NOTE: THE 
VATICAN HAS SAID POPE JOHN PAUL II WILL BE VISITING CATHOLIC 
FAITHFUL AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY INSENSITIVE INITIATIVES 
TOWARDS ORTHODOX LEADERS. END NOTE). CARDINAL HUSAR POINTED 
OUT THAT IN THE PAST THE COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MACHINE HAD 
PORTRAYED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS A TOOL OF THE WEST 
DEDICATED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET STATE, AND THAT 
THE LINGERING EFFECTS OF THAT MESSAGE MAKE MANY UKRAINIANS 
UNEASY ABOUT THE CHURCH. HUSAR OPINED THAT THE UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT BACKED THE PAPAL VISIT AS A \"MEANS OF DRAWING THE 
COUNTRY CLOSER TO THE OTHER NATIONS OF EUROPE.\"

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND PUERTO RICO. THE 49-YEAR-OLD 
CLEVELAND NATIVE WILL BE ORDAINED AN ARCHBISHOP BY THE POPE

CHIEF OF STAFF FOR VATICAN SECRETARY OF STATE (PRIME 
MINISTER EQUIVALENT), CARDINAL ANGELO SODANO. HE WAS 
ORDAINED A PRIEST IN 1977 AND HAS A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN 
CHURCH LAW. BROGLIO ENTERED THE VATICAN\'S DIPLOMATIC SERVICE 
IN 1983 AND HAS SERVED IN IVORY COAST AND PARAGUAY, AS WELL 
AS AT THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY. HE SPEAKS FRENCH, 
ITALIAN AND SPANISH. MERANTE

MINISTER TAURAN IS ATTENDING THE POPE\'S ANNUAL LENTEN

3.  (C) MIGLIORE EXPANDED UPON THE TEXT OF THE PRO 
MEMORIA.  HE SAID THAT THE VATICAN IS REQUESTING THE U.S. 
AND THE UK TO PUT PRESSURE ON UGANDA AND RWANDA TO FULLY 
WITHDRAW ITS TROOPS FROM THE KIVU REGION, TO IMMEDIATELY 
CEASE THE ILLEGAL EXPLOITATION OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES, 
AND TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERCONGOLESE DIALOG. 
MIGLIORE SAID THAT THE UGANDAN/RWANDAN OCCUPATION OF KIVU 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATH OF OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE 
PAST FEW YEARS. 
 
4.  (C) CHARGE INQUIRED IF THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE 
APPROACHING OTHER COUNTRIES IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. AND THE 
UK.  MIGLIORE SAID THAT THE VATICAN HAD DECIDED TO LIMIT 
ITS DEMARCHE TO THE U.S. AND THE UK ON THE SITUATION IN THE 
KIVU REGION BECAUSE IT BELIEVES WE ARE THE TWO COUNTRIES 
WITH THE MOST INFLUENCE WITH THE RWANDANS AND THE UGANDANS. 
HOWEVER,  THE VATICAN WILL BE CONTACTING THE ANGOLANS AND 
THE ZIMBABWEANS TO URGE THEM TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE

WAR. HE NOTED THAT MANY COUNTRIES SHARED THE VATICAN\'S

OF CONVERSATION WAS THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE NEED FOR \"A 
CLIMATE OF DQTENTE AND DIALOGUE.\" (SEPTEL TO FOLLOW). THE 
VATICAN STATEMENT SAID PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS LINKED 
TO \"RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW ON THE PART OF ALL AND 
IN THE CONVICTION THAT THE PEOPLES HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS 
AND DUTIES.\" VATICAN FM, ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN, 
ALSO HELD DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS EGYPTIAN COUNTERPART, AMR 
MOUSSA. ON FEBRUARY 18, POPE JOHN PAUL LAMENTED THE 
INCREASE IN PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI VIOLENCE AND SAID THE 
PROSPECTS FOR PEACE WERE GROWING DIM. MEANWHILE, THE 
VATICAN AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL, ARCHBISHOP PIETRO SAMBI, 
CALLED ON TOURISTS AND PILGRIMS NOT TO ABANDON JERUSALEM

\"ALARMING MEDIA REPORTS ACCORDING TO WHICH THE HOLY LAND 
IS DROWNED IN TERROR.\" SAMBI SAID PRECAUTIONS HAD TO BE 
TAKEN, BUT THAT PILGRIMS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE 
PRESENT VIOLENCE. (COMMENT: SAMBI EARLIER EXPRESSED 
CONCERN ABOUT THE FALL OFF IN PILGRIMS AND TOURISTS 
IMPACTING ECONOMICALLY ON PALESTINIANS, BOTH MOSLEM AND 
CHRISTIAN. HIS ASSURANCES ABOUT PILGRIM SAFETY SUGGEST

APOSTOLIC (ORTHODOX) COMMUNITY. (COMMENT: THE VATICAN AND 
THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH IN ARMENIA ENJOY EXCELLENT 
RELATIONS. THE POPE AND THE FORMER CATHOLICOS (LEADER) 
HAD DEVELOPED A WARM FRIENDSHIP. THEOLOGICAL DISPUTES 
BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND APOSTOLIC ARMENIANS WERE RESOLVED 
IN 1996. FULL UNITY BETWEEN THE TWO CHURCHES WOULD BE A

INTERVIEW WITH VATICAN RADIO, SGRECCIA SAID THE VATICAN 
APPRECIATES AND ENCOURAGES SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WHEN IT IS 
GEARED TOWARDS \"THE PREVENTION AND HEALING OF ILLNESSES 
AND THE RELIEF OF HUMAN SUFFERING.\" THE BISHOPS STRESSED 
THAT RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION MUST SHOW RESPECT FOR 
ALL HUMAN LIFE FROM CONCEPTION TO NATURAL DEATH, AND 
ESPECIALLY WHEN SUBJECTS ARE UNABLE TO CONSENT TO 
PROCEDURES. BISHOP SGRECCIA REAFFIRMED THE VATICAN\'S 
OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF FETAL STEM CELLS FOR RESEARCH 
UNLESS THE CELLS CAME FROM SPONTANEOUSLY ABORTED FETUSES. 
THE VATICAN ACCEPTS RESEARCH USING STEM CELLS TAKEN FROM 
THE UMBILICAL CORD OF NEWBORN INFANTS AND FROM ADULTS. 
SGRECCIA SAID THE VATICAN ALSO SUPPORTS BIOTECHNOLOGY AS 
LONG AS PROPER SAFEGUARDS ARE MAINTAINED, CONSUMERS

7.   IN A SIGN OF RESPECT FOR EASTERN-RITE CHURCHES 
UNITED TO ROME, THREE NEW CARDINALS DID NOT RECEIVE THE 
TRADITIONAL RED \"BEANIES\" AND BRIM-LESS \"BIRETTAS\" DURING 
A FEBRUARY 21 VATICAN CITY CEREMONY. THE MODIFICATION OF 
THE CEREMONY REFLECTS CURRENT VATICAN POLICY TOWARDS 
ANCIENT NON-ROMAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE UNIQUE 
RITUALS, LANGUAGE AND TRADITIONS. ONE OF THE NEW 
CARDINALS AND HEAD OF THE VATICAN OFFICE FOR EASTERN 
CHURCHES, SYRIAN PATRIARCH MOUSSA DAOUD SAID NOT 
RECEIVING THE RED HAT SIGNIFIED THAT THE ORIENTAL-RITE

CARDINALS CONTINUE TO BE LINKED TO THEIR LOCAL CHURCHES 
AND DO NOT BECOME MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY OF ROME. (NOTE: 
CARDINALS ARE TRADITIONALLY MEMBERS OF THE ROMAN CLERGY. 
\"NON-ROMAN\" CARDINALS ARE GIVEN TITLE TO ONE OF ROME\'S 
CHURCHES ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE CASE FOR THE NEW 
CARDINAL-PATRIARCHS FROM SYRIA AND EGYPT. THE UKRAINIAN 
EASTERN-RITE CARDINAL IS A MONK. HE DID NOT RECEIVE A RED 
HAT, BUT WAS GIVEN TITLE TO ONE OF ROME\'S CHURCHES. END

SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN\'S VISIT TO IRAN 
 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY CDA JOSEPH MERANTE FOR REASONS 1.5 
(A) AND (D) . 
 
2. (C) CHARGE CALLED ON VATICAN DIRECTOR OF MIDDLE 
EASTERN AFFAIRS MONS. GIANNI D\'ANIELLO ON MARCH 12 TO 
DISCUSS FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN\'S MARCH 3-8 TRIP TO IRAN. 
D\'ANIELLO, WHO ACCOMPANIED THE FOREIGN MINISTER, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01390  121701Z 
CATEGORIZED THE VISIT AS \"HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL\".  HE SAID 
THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE VISIT WAS TO LOBBY FOR INCREASED 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR CATHOLICS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER 
CHRISTIANS IN IRAN.  ACCORDING TO D\'ANIELLO, THE LARGEST 
GROUPS IN COMMUNION WITH ROME ARE THE CHALDEANS, SOME 
MELKITES, AND EUROPEANS WHO WOULD BE MEMBERS OF THE LATIN 
CHURCH.  TWO OTHER MAIN BODIES OF CHRISTIANS ON WHOSE 
BEHALF THE VATICAN WANTED TO SPEAK ARE THE ASSYRIAN 
CHURCH OF THE EAST, AND THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. 
D\'ANIELLO SAID THAT IN GENERAL, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR 
THESE CHRISTIAN GROUPS WAS NOT GREATLY CURTAILED, AND THE 
IRANIAN GOVERNMENT PROMISED EVEN GREATER LATITUDE.  HE 
SAID THAT HE AND TAURAN FOUND STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS INDICATIVE OF AN EVOLVING OPENNESS ON THE PART 
OF IRAN, BUT ADDED THAT THE VATICAN IS STILL UNSURE IF WE 
CAN EXPECT CONTINUED OPENNESS OR A RETURN TO MORE 
REACTIONARY POLICIES. 
 
3. (C) D\'ANIELLO SAID THAT TAURAN RAISED THE SITUATION OF 
THE IRANIAN JEWS WHO WERE SENTENCED FOR SPYING FOR ISRAEL 
DIRECTLY IN A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT 
KHATAMI.  HE SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS NONCOMMITTAL. 
HOWEVER, ON THE ISSUE OF THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS, 
D\'ANIELLO SAID THAT IRAN AGREES WITH THE VATICAN, THAT 
THE VIOLENCE MUST END AND THAT THE TWO PARTIES RESUME 
NEGOTIATIONS.  D\'ANIELLO USED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY 
THAT HE \"WASN\'T SPEAKING OFFICIALLY\" BUT THAT THE VATICAN 
IS HAVING INCREASED CONCERNS THAT IN AN ULTIMATE 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES, THE CHRISTIANS OF 
JERUSALEM WILL BE \"LEFT OUT\".  HE ASKED THAT WE PAY 
ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF ALL THREE RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01390  121701Z 
ANY DISCUSSIONS IN WHICH THE U.S MIGHT TAKE PART. (NOTE: 
THIS DIM VIEW OF THE MEPP WAS ALSO REFLECTED IN A 3/11 
DINNER CONVERSATION ACTING DCM HAD WITH ISRAELI EMBASSY 
DCM. THE ISRAELI DCM RELATED THAT THE VATICAN HAD 
REBUFFED THE ISRAELI EMBASSY\'S ATTEMPTS TO SECURE A 
LOCATION IN VATICAN CITY TO HOLD AN EVENT COMMEMORATING 
THE LST ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE\'S VISIT, SAYING THAT THE 
HOLY SEE DID NOT \"VIEW THAT VISIT AS A SUCCESS.\") 
 
4. (C) CHARGE CALLED AUSTRIAN DCM LATER IN THE DAY TO GET 
READOUT OF FM TAURAN\'S MORNING BRIEFING ON THE TRIP TO EU 
EMBASSIES.  ACCORDING TO AUSTRIAN DCM, TAURAN SAID HE 
RAISED 1) IMPORTATION OF BIBLES; 2) THE NEED FOR A 
JUDICIAL STATUS FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN IRAN; 3) 
RETURN OF SOME PROPERTIES CONFISCATED AFTER THE 1979 
REVOLUTION. HE ALSO TOLD THE EU AMBASSADORS THAT KHATAMI 
SAID THE SENTENCES OF THE IRANIAN JEWS WERE \"FINAL\", BUT 
\"EARLY PARDON\" SHOULD NOT BE RULED OUT. 
 
5. (C) D\'ANIELLO ALSO USED THE VISIT TO PRESENT A NOTE 
VERBALE ON THE CASE OF ZIVKOVICH AND ALPERIN VS. THE 
IOR.(SEPTEL TO FOLLOW, NOTE FAXED TO EUR/WE, L/DL 3/12). 
 
6. (C) COMMENT: A MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY GOAL OF THE 
VATICAN IS PROTECTION OF THE CHRISTIANS IN ISLAMIC 
COUNTRIES.  THUS, IN THOSE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES, SUCH AS 
IRAN AND IRAQ, IN WHICH THE VATICAN BELIEVES THE STATUS 
OF CHRISTIANS IS NOT GREATLY COMPROMISED, WE SHOULD 
EXPECT VATICAN ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT.  MERANTE

EMAILS 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  THE HOLY SEE DOES NOT SHARE THE 
POLITICAL VIEWS OF THE BISHOP OF MOSTAR AND OTHER 
CROAT-NATIONALIST CLERGY IN B-H AND IT IS DOING THE 
UTMOST WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL LIMITS OF THE CHURCH 
TO CHANGE THEIR POLITICAL BEHAVIOR.  OUR 
INTERLOCUTORS BELIEVE THE CLERGY\'S VALID CONCERNS ON 
BEHALF OF THEIR FLOCK WERE REFLECTED IN MARCH 2 
LETTER CARDINAL PULJIC SENT PRESIDENT BUSH.  FOR 
NOW, THE HOLY SEE\'S EFFORTS TO EFFECT CHANGE IN THE 
HERZEGOVINIAN CLERGY ARE FOCUSED ON THE NUNCIO IN 
SARAJEVO.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  A/DCM FOLLOWED UP ON REF A EXCHANGE IN A 
3/9 MEETING WITH VATICAN BALKANS DIRECTOR MSGR. 
JOSEPH MARINO.  IN THAT CONVERSATION, MARINO SAID 
THAT HE HAD ALREADY HEARD ON THE ISSUE OF THE BISHOP 
OF MOSTAR FROM SRSG JACQUES KLEIN 3/5.  FRENCH AMB. 
TO THE HOLY SEE DEJAMMET ALSO CALLED 2/8.  MARINO 
SAID THIS WAS CLEARLY HIS \"ISSUE DU JOUR\" AND THAT 
HE HAD PREPARED A PAPER FOR FM TAURAN UPON THE 
LATTER\'S RETURN FROM IRAN.  MARINO TOOK A/DCM\'S 
POINT THAT BISHOP PERIC HAD OVERSTEPPED IN CALLING 
FOR A UNILATERAL REVISION OF DAYTON AND IN PUBLICLY 
SUPPORTING CONVICTED WAR CRIMINALS, BUT HE OPINED 
THAT THE CROATS HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR MANY MONTHS 
THAT THEIR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS HAVE BEEN LARGELY 
IGNORED BY THE I/C.  WHEN A/DCM PRESSED FOR THE HOLY 
SEE TO DO SOMETHING TO REIN-IN THE BISHOP, MARINO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01419  01 OF 02  131649Z 
EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE THE HOLY SEE 
COULD DO OTHER THAN PULL THE BISHOP ASIDE FOR A 
QUIET TALK (NOTE: SEE PARAS 5-6 FOR FURTHER 
BACKGROUND ON THE LIMITS FACED BY THE HOLY SEE IN 
DEALING WITH POLITICAL MATTERS INSIDE THE CHURCH. 
FYI: TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, NEITHER PERIC NOR 
PULJIC ARE FRANCISCAN; WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE 
FRANCISCANS REPRESENT YET ANOTHER OBSTACLE TO INTER- 
COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION IN B-H. END NOTE.) 
 
3.  (C) A/DCM FOLLOWED UP REF C INSTRUCTION ON 2/13, 
MEETING AGAIN WITH MSGR. MARINO.  AFTER HEARING THE 
TALKING POINTS, MARINO ASSURED US THAT THE VATICAN 
HAS HEARD THE SAME MESSAGE FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES 
AND THAT IT WILL DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO TRY 
TO CHANGE THE HERZEGOVINA CLERGY\'S BEHAVIOR.  HE 
POINTED OUT THAT THE HOLY SEE IS ON RECORD 
SUPPORTING A DEMOCRATIC AND MULTIETHNIC B-H, AND 
THAT THIS POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED.  HE SAID THAT 
THE NUNCIO IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED UNDER INSTRUCTION 
FROM THE HOLY SEE, HAS ALREADY SPOKEN WITH CARDINAL 
PULJIC, AND WILL LIKELY SPEAK WITH BISHOP PERIC 
SOON.  HE NOTED THAT PULJIC HAD SENT A LETTER TO 
PRESIDENT BUSH MARCH 2, AND THOUGHT THAT A HIGH- 
LEVEL RESPONSE MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY FOR THE USG TO 
REINFORCE THE NUNCIO\'S REPRESENTATIONS. 
 
4.  (C) A/DCM PRESSED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A PUBLIC 
STATEMENT FROM THE HOLY SEE; IF NOT A DENUNCIATION 
OF THE MOSTAR BISHOP THEN AT LEAST A RESTATEMENT OF 
RELEVANT PASSAGES FROM THE PONTIFF\'S NEW YEARS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01419  01 OF 02  131649Z 
MESSAGE SUPPORTING DEMOCRACY AND MULTIETHNIC/INTER- 
COMMUNAL SOCIETIES.  MARINO REPLIED THAT THE CHURCH 
WOULD NOT PUBLICLY DISAVOW OF ONE OF ITS OWN OVER A 
POLITICAL MATTER, RECALLING THAT DURING THE PEOPLE 
POWER REVOLUTION IN MANILA CARDINAL SIN WAS MORE 
ACTIVE THAN THE CHURCH PREFERRED.  NOR IS THE HOLY 
SEE CONTEMPLATING SENDING A HIGHER LEVEL OFFICIAL 
FROM THE SECOND SECRETARIAT (NOTE: MFA EQUIVALENT) 
TO REINFORCE THE NUNCIO\'S MESSAGE.  A/DCM RECALLED 
THAT AS RECENTLY AS LAST SUNDAY THE PONTIFF 
 PUBLICLY 
CONDEMNED BASQUE TERRORISM IN VERY STRONG TERMS EVEN 
THOUGH THE BASQUE CHURCH IS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS 
SUPPORT OF BASQUE INDEPENDENCE.  MARINO RESPONDED 
THAT THERE IS A NEW BASQUE BISHOP WHO FULLY 
SUPPORTED THE PONTIFF\'S STATEMENT; THE SITUATION IN 
B-H, WHILE SIMILAR, IS THUS NOT FULLY ANALOGOUS.

5.  (SBU) CATHOLIC BISHOPS ENJOY A UNIQUE AUTONOMY 
WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT 
FALL INTO THEOLOGICAL, MORAL OR SPIRITUAL ERROR, 
THERE IS LITTLE THE POPE AND VATICAN OFFICIALS CAN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01419  02 OF 02  131649Z 
DO TO CORRECT A BISHOP\'S POLITICAL/POLITICAL 
INDISCRETIONS, EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE THE INCLINATION 
TO DO SO.  THE POPE IS THE SOLE JUDGE OF BISHOPS, 
BUT HAS \"JURIDICAL COMPETENCE\" ONLY IN SPIRITUAL OR 
ECCLESIASTICAL MATTERS.  IN THE LAST 100 YEARS, 
CATHOLIC BISHOPS HAVE HELD A VARIETY OF POLITICAL 
POSITIONS RANGING FROM NEAR-MARXIST SOCIALISM TO 
HARD-LINE FASCISM, WITHOUT BEING DISCIPLINED BY THE 
HOLY SEE.  THE POLITICAL POLICY OF POPES AND THE 
VATICAN GOVERNMENT TENDS TO BE CENTRIST, BUT IT HAS 
NEITHER THE AUTHORITY NOR, USUALLY, THE WILL TO 
PROMOTE ONE POLITICAL EXPRESSION OVER ANOTHER. 
 
6.   (SBU)  FURTHERMORE, UNDER THE PRINCIPLE KNOWN 
AS SUBSIDIARITY IT IS VATICAN POLICY NOT TO CARRY 
OUT AT A HIGHER LEVEL WHAT CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY 
ACHIEVED AT A LOWER LEVEL.  IF THE VATICAN WERE TO 
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DIVISIVE NATIONALISTIC REMARKS 
MADE BY AN OTHERWISE THEOLOGICALLY AND MORALLY 
FAITHFUL CATHOLIC BISHOP, IT COULD BEGIN AN 
INTERVENTION THROUGH THE LOCAL CATHOLIC HIERARCHY: A 
NEIGHBORING BISHOP, THEN A SENIOR BISHOP, THEN 
PERHAPS THE PAPAL NUNCIO. THIS APPROACH HAS WORKED 
IN THE PAST WHERE THE BISHOPS\' COUNCIL IS LARGE, AND 
CONTAINS BISHOPS WITH POLITICAL VIEWS SYMPATHETIC TO 
THOSE OF THE HOLY SEE (NOTE: APPARENTLY NOT THE CASE 
IN B-H) .

7.  (C)  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CROATIA AND B-H IS A 
FIERCELY LOYAL SUPPORTER OF THE PRESENT POPE AND OF 
THE VATICAN.  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD 
WISH TO PUBLICLY CHASTISE A CROATIAN BISHOP, 
APPOINTED BY POPE JOHN PAUL II, FOR EXCEEDING THE 
BOUNDS OF POLITICAL PRUDENCE.  POST HAS OVER PAST 
MONTHS DISCUSSED WITH THE VATICAN AS WELL AS WITH 
OTHER CONTACTS POSSIBLE AVENUES TO TAME THE MOSTAR 
BISHOP\'S MORE DESTRUCTIVE NATIONALIST IMPULSES. 
POST WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WHETHER THE BISHOPS OF 
THE CROAT BISHOPS CONFERENCE SUPPORT PERIC\'S 
ACTIVITY.  FOR NOW, WE ARE SEEKING TO DEVELOP AN 
INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE (REF D) WITH THE 
SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY, IN LARGE PART TO TRY TO BRING 
PERIC OUT OF THE CROAT-NATIONALIST POLITICAL 
WILDERNESS.

(D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY: EMBASSY OFFICERS MET 2/7 WITH VATICAN NGO 
\"CARITAS INTERNATIONAL\" CUBA SPECIALISTS FOR A CONVERSATION 
ON CARITAS\' HUMANITARIAN WORK IN CUBA. THE OFFICIALS WERE 
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY AND 
THE ROLE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THEY CLAIMED CARITAS CUBA 
ENJOYED A REASONABLE DEGREE OF FREEDOM AND MAINTAINED A 
COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT. THEY 
CHALLENGED THE USG TO \"ENGAGE\" WITH THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
INSTEAD OF ISOLATING IT WITH INEFFECTIVE EMBARGO. THEY 
FORESAW A USEFUL ROLE FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE US IN 
CUBA\'S FUTURE SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
AND URGED THE USG TO PLAN NOW FOR THE POST-CASTRO ERA. END 
SUMMARY.

2.   (C)  EMBASSY OFFICERS MET MARCH 7 WITH CARITAS 
INTERNATIONAL CUBA SPECIALIST, FATHER NELSON VIOLA (AN 
ARGENTINE NATIONAL) AND CARITAS CARIBBEAN DESK OFFICER EBER 
FERRER (BRAZILIAN). THEY DISMISSED REFTEL REPORT THAT THE 
CUBAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT STEP UP PRESSURE ON THEM BECAUSE OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01436  01 OF 03  161439Z 
THE NEW U.S. ADMINISTRATION\'S INITIATIVE FOR FAITH RELIEF 
AGENCIES.  AFTER INSISTING THAT CARITAS WAS NOT \"POLITICAL\" 
AND ONLY MET A HUMANITARIAN NEED, THEY OFFERED THEIR CANDID 
APPRAISAL OF THE SITUATION IN CUBA. BOTH MEN NOTED HIGH 
STANDARDS OF INTELLECTUAL, CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT AMONG CUBANS. HOWEVER, THEY LAMENTED POOR 
INFRASTRUCTURE, EXCESSIVE STATE CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY, AND 
HARD-LINE ATTITUDES WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT THAT IMPEDED 
DEVELOPMENT.  VIOLA CLAIMED CUBA\'S MARKET ECONOMY IS SLOWLY 
DEVELOPING IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS, AND THAT 
THE OVERALL ECONOMY IS BETTER BECAUSE OF TOURISM AND THE 
INFLUX OF HARD CURRENCY REMITTANCES.  HE SAID THE GENERAL 
POPULATION HAD LESS FEAR OF THE STATE AND THAT PLURALISM 
HAD BEGUN TO TAKE HOLD. 
 
3.  (C)  THEY BOTH CALLED THE U.S. EMBARGO AN ANACHRONISM 
THAT WAS STILL MANIPULATED BY FIDEL CASTRO AS AN EXCUSE FOR 
CUBA\'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WOES.  FR. VIOLA OPINED THAT 
CARITAS WOULD HAVE LESS WORK TO DO IN CUBA IF THE U.S. 
EMBARGO WERE LIFTED, ALTHOUGH THE CHURCH\'S OPPOSITION TO IT 
WAS PRACTICAL, NOT POLITICAL.  HE SAID IT WAS 
UNDERSTANDABLE DURING THE COLD WAR, IF NOT JUSTIFIED, BUT 
THAT NOW THE U.S. IS JUST LOSING BUSINESS TO EUROPEAN 
COMPETITORS. 
 
4.  (C)  VIOLA SAID CARITAS FUNNELS MOST OF ITS ASSISTANCE 
THROUGH OFFICIAL CUBAN MECHANISMS.  IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH 
CUBAN OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT THERE IS NO HUNGER IN THE 
COUNTRY, CARITAS DISCREETLY RUNS \"SOUP KITCHENS,\" FOR THE 
ELDERLY AND UNMARRIED MOTHERS.  THE GOC DISCOURAGES RELIEF 
THAT DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE SOCIALIST MODEL (WHICH WOULD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO FOOD FOR ALL), BUT TOLERATES THESE 
CARITAS ENTERPRISES.  VIOLA SAID THAT OFTEN THE SOUP 
KITCHENS OPERATE FROM THE RESIDENCE OF A LOCAL CLERGYMAN 
WHO CLOAKS IT AS A GESTURE OF HOSPITALITY TO ALLAY OFFICIAL 
SUSPICIONS. 
 
-------------------------------- 
SITUATION OF CHRISTIANS IMPROVED 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  FATHER VIOLA CLAIMS THAT IT HAS TAKEN CUBANS 40 
YEARS TO WAKE UP TO CASTRO\'S TWO MAIN ERRORS: HIS ANTI- 
AMERICAN POLICY AND HIS PROMOTION OF AN ATHEISTIC 
COMMUNISM. VIOLA CLAIMS THAT PUBLIC MANIFESTATION OF 
RELIGION IS BECOMING MORE ACCEPTABLE AND THAT THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH HAS A GROWING INFLUENCE ON CUBAN SOCIETY.  ATTENDING 
CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS SERVICES NO LONGER LEADS INEVITABLY TO 
SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP -- EVEN SOME COMMUNIST PARTY 
MEMBERS ARE NOW OPENLY CATHOLIC.  THE DIALOGUE THAT BEGAN 
BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE GOC IN RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC 
CRISIS AFTER THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL CONTINUES TODAY. 
CARITAS CUBA HAS GROWN FROM A SMALL HAVANA-BASED BRANCH TO 
A PRESENCE IN EVERY PARISH IN 2001. FATHER VIOLA DISMISSED 
CLAIMS THAT THE 1999 PAPAL VISIT HAD COME TO NOTHING IN THE 
END.  HE SAID MANY CHRISTIANS EXPECTED TOO MUCH AT ONCE. 
CHANGE, HE OPINED, TAKES A LONG TIME AND IT WAS AN 
ABSURDITY TO EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE.  THE PAPAL VISIT WAS A 
CATALYST FOR CHANGE.

TO THE INTELLECTUAL AWAKENING OF THE CUBAN POPLE.  HE 
ATTRIBUTED OPPOSITION TO RELIGION AND O THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH TO A \"NATURAL SOCIOLOGICALAND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
REACTION\" DURING THE REVOLUTIOARY PERIOD.  ACCORDING TO 
VIOLA, THE CATHOLIC CHRCH HAS RECEIVED HAVANA\'S APPROVAL 
TO OPEN A THIR SEMINARY TO TRAIN FUTURE CLERGY (THERE ARE 
ALREDY TWO IN OPERATION) AND THAT CUBA\'S BISHOPS ARE FEE 
TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY.  THE CHURCHIS CONTENT 
WITH, BT MONITORING CUBA\'S SECULAR EUCATION SYSTEM TO 
GUARD AGAINST THE TEACHING OF ATI-CHRISTIAN THEMES. THE

LOGISTICAL AND COMMUNICATIONS REASONS.  HE BELIEVED THE 
U.S. HAD A KEY ROLE TO PLAY IN THAT THE COORDINATION CENTER 
MUT OPERATE ON A DEMOCRATIC MODEL.  ITS WORK WOULD HVE TO 
BE VERY DISCRETE AND ABOVE POLITICAL ISSUE.  HE SAID THE 
ARCHDIOCESE WAS ALREADY WORKING WTH YOUNG CUBAN-AMERICANS 
TO CHANGE ATTITUDES AND OSTER RECONCILIATION.  FATHER 
VIOLA MENTIONED MIAMI ASSISTANT BISHOP THOMAS G. WENSKI 
WAS A KEY FIGURE FOR U.S. CATHOLIC CHURCH EFFORTS IN CUBA 
AND THE CARIBBEAN REGION. 
 
9.  (C)  FATHER VIOLA ALSO ENTHUSED OVER A MEDICAL PROJECT 
IN THE DIOCESE OF SANTA CLARA.  SUPPORTED BY THE CUBAN 
GOVERNMENT AND AT ONE STAGE TO HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY A U.S. 
FOUNDATION, THE JOHN PAUL II PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY INSTITUTE 
OWNED AND MANAGED BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS TO BE A 
CATCHMENT HOSPITAL FOR ALL OF LATIN AMERICA, AND COULD 
\"SERVE EVERYONE\'S INTERESTS.\"  APPARENTLY A FUNDING HICCUP 
HAS STALLED IT.  VIOLA PROFFERED THE HOSPITAL AS A PROJECT 
IN WHICH THE U.S. COULD BECOME INVOLVED, PERHAPS THROUGH 
THE MEDIATION OF THE MIAMI ARCHDIOCESE, AND SO ENGAGE THE 
CUBAN GOVERNMENT.  HE SAID CUBA WAS RIPE FOR CHANGE AND A 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01436  02 OF 03  161443Z 
PROJECT SUCH AS THIS COULD HELP STIMULATE POSITIVE CHANGE. 
ACCORDING TO VIOLA, U.S. ASSISTANCE IN THE PROJECT WOULD 
ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECT OUR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE, DAMAGED BY 
THE EMBARGO. 
 
----------------------- 
APRES CASTRO LE DELUGE? 
----------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  FATHER VIOLA URGED THE USG TO PLAN NOW FOR A 
POST-CASTRO TRANSITION, AT THE SAME TIME INSISTING THAT 
SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE WOULD HAVE GREATEST 
SUCCESS WHILE CASTRO WAS STILL ALIVE.  HE SAID THE 
ATMOSPHERE IN CUBA WAS TENSE, AND THAT THERE WAS A RISK OF 
VIOLENCE WITH THE TRANSITION FROM AUTHORITARIANISM TO A 
MORE LIBERAL CLIMATE.  THIS WAS AGGRAVATED BY VOCIFEROUS 
HARD-LINERS ON ALL SIDES.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  CLEARLY VIOLA WAS CONFIDENT ABOUT THE CHURCH\'S 
FUTURE IN CUBA.  HE EXPLAINED HIS UNVARNISHED CRITICISM OF 
USG POLICY BY SAYING \"I ASK A LOT OF HAVANA, BUT I HAVE A 
RIGHT TO ASK EVEN MORE OF YOU.\"  ALTHOUGH THIS INITIAL 
MEETING WITH A/DCM WAS A RECITATION OF RAMBLING ANALYSES, 
SHIBBOLETHS, AND PLATITUDES, WE BELIEVE VIOLA CAN BE AN 
IMPORTANT LENS INTO CUBAN AFFAIRS SINCE HE TRAVELS 
REGULARLY THROUGHOUT CUBA AND APPEARS WILLING TO SHARE HIS

1.  (C) POLOFF DELIVERED REFTEL DEMARCHE TO MSGR. LEO 
BOCCARDI, VATICAN MFA DESK OFFICER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ON 
MARCH 15.  MSGR. BOCCARDI REVIEWED THE POINTS FOR THE 57TH 
COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ENTHUSIASTICALLY.  HE CLAIMED 
NOTABLE CONGRUENCE BETWEEN MANY VATICAN AND USG POSITIONS, 
PARTICULARLY ON THE CERD (COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF 
ALL FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION) PROCESS, UNDERLINING 
THE RISK OF INFRINGEMENT ON THE JUDICIAL SOVEREIGNTY OF 
SIGNATORIES.  MSGR. BOCCARDI ENDORSED THE WORLD CONFERENCE 
AGAINST RACISM (WCAR) TO BE HELD IN DURBAN, OUTLINING A 
PROACTIVE VATICAN STRATEGY IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE 
CONFERENCE. 
 
2.  (C) VATICAN STRATEGY IN THE RUN-UP TO WCAR WILL FEATURE 
PROMINENT PAPAL CONDEMNATIONS OF RACISM.  THE VATICAN WCAR 
PROGRAM WILL SEEK TO COMBAT RACISM THROUGH A) EDUCATION, 
THROUGH WORKSHOPS IN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS; B) INCREASED INTER- 
RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE; AND C) AN AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF 
MINORITY GROUPS, WITH THE VATICAN PLEDGING TO PRESSURE 
EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TO SAFEGUARD THE RIGHTS OF THE ROMA 
MINORITY IN PARTICULAR. 
 
3.  (C) MSGR. BOCCARDI CONCURRED WITH USG CONCERN THAT 
REGIONAL BLOCS MAY FRUSTRATE CONSENSUS ON CRUCIAL POINTS. 
HE REFERRED TO A RECENT PROCLAMATION IN TEHRAN BY MUSLIM 
MIDDLE EASTERN GOVERNMENTS THAT PALESTINE WAS BY DEFINITION 
A MUSLIM NATION, AN ASSERTION THE VATICAN DEEMED 
UNACCEPTABLE.  HE WARNED OF A POSSIBLE EFFORT AT THE WCAR

4.  (C) MSGR. BOCCARDI WARNED OF POSSIBLE VATICAN CONFLICT 
AT DURBAN IF AN EFFORT WERE MADE TO ENSHRINE SEXUAL 
ORIENTATION AS GROUNDS FOR DEFINITION OF A RACIAL MINORITY. 
MSGR. BOCCARDI DECLARED THE VATICAN COULD ENDORSE LANGUAGE 
ABHORRING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF QUOTE SEX OR 
GENDER ENDQUOTE; HOWEVER, SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS SUCH WAS AN 
UNACCEPTABLE CATEGORY FOR THE VATICAN.  ACCORDING TO MSGR. 
BOCCARDI, THIS DEBATE WAS ADVANCED BY THE BRAZILIAN 
DELEGATION AT A PREVIOUS CONFERENCE IN SANTIAGO.  MSGR. 
BOCCARDI WAS CAREFUL NOT TO CRITICIZE USG POSITIONS. 
FURTHERMORE, HE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNED DISCRIMINATION AND 
VIOLENCE TOWARD LESBIAN OR GAY PERSONS.     MERANTE

ARCHBISHOP AGOSTINO MARCHETTO, OPINED THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
AND HUMAN HEALTH RISKS OF BIO-ENGINEERED FOOD DEMAND 
STRONGER INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND CONTROLS. THE 
REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL 
ORGANIZATION SHOULD CONSIDER TAKING A LEAD ROLE, ESPECIALLY 
IN EDUCATION AND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES. ACCORDING TO 
ARCHBISHOP MARCHETTO, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES RAISED 
BY GENETICALLY ALTERED FOODS HAVE A GLOBAL IMPACT AND THUS 
REQUIRE INTERNATIONALLY GUARANTEED STANDARDS. HE SAID THE 
FAO SHOULD ACTIVELY PURSUE \"BIOSECURITY\" QUESTIONS, DRAWING 
ON ITS POSITION AS A CENTRALIZED AGENCY OF INFORMATION AND 
RESEARCH ON AGRICULTURAL ISSUES. THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THIS 
WOULD ALLOW THE ORGANIZATION TO CONTINUE TO HELP MEMBER 
STATES ENACT CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR THE FOOD PRODUCTION

DRUG INJECTION ROOMS WHERE ADDICTS CAN SHOOT UP UNDER

SAID GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SHOULD FOCUS INSTEAD ON ADDICTS\' 
REHABILITATION AND REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY. HE SAID DRUG 
DEPENDENCY WAS NOT A RIGHT OR A FREEDOM BECAUSE IT DAMAGED 
THE ADDICT AND WAS A SELF-RENUNCIATION OF PERSONAL DIGNITY. 
REZEAU SAID COUNTRIES IN FAVOR OF THE INJECTION ROOMS 
POINTED TO REDUCTIONS IN OVERDOSE DEATHS, INFECTIONS AND 
DISEASE TRANSMISSION AS BENEFITS OF THE INJECTING ROOM 
PROGRAM. HE RETORTED THAT SUCH PROGRAMS HAD DISADVANTAGES 
INCLUDING A NEGLIGIBLE DESIRE FOR SOCIAL REINTEGRATION.

REDUCE INSTANCES OF OVERDOSE AND INFECTION, WHILE AT THE 
SAME TIME HELPING ADDICTS TO RECOVER THEIR PLACE IN SOCIETY.

HE HAS NEVER GIVEN UP ON A SINGLE THING HE SET OUT TO DO

OCCASION TO ACCOMMODATE HIS ILLNESS. HE ALMOST COLLAPSED 
DURING ONE EVENT BECAUSE OF A STOMACH VIRUS AND HAD TO BE 
HELPED BACK INTO HIS APARTMENT. END NOTE). NAVARRO-VALLS 
CLAIMED THE POPE HAS THE PHYSICAL CAPACITY FOR THE WORK HE 
IS DOING. THE COMMENTS CAME AHEAD OF THE PONTIFF\'S UP-COMING 
PILGRIMAGE TO SYRIA, GREECE AND MALTA. RECENT VISITORS TO

CHRISTO PROYKOV STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF A PAPAL VISIT TO 
PREDOMINANTLY ORTHODOX BULGARIA. IF THE TRIP GOES AHEAD IT 
WOULD BE THE FIFTH TRIP FOR POPE JOHN PAUL II TO AN ORTHODOX 
COUNTRY AFTER ROMANIA AND HIS UPCOMING VISITS TO GREECE,

BULGARIA\'S ORTHODOX CHURCH, PATRIARCH MAXIM, HAD AGREED TO 
MEET WITH THE POPE IF HE CAME, BUT ALSO THAT HE WOULD BE 
FOLLOWING CAREFULLY THE RESULTS OF THE POPE\'S VISIT TO 
GREECE IN MAY. (COMMENT: WITH NEWS AGENCIES ALSO REPORTING A 
POSSIBLE PAPAL VISIT TO CYPRUS, THE POPE\'S OUTREACH TO THE 
ORTHODOX CHURCH APPEARS TO BE GAINING MOMENTUM. IT IS NO 
SECRET THAT POPE JOHN PAUL WOULD CONSIDER THE HEALING OF THE 
 
SIPDIS 
TEN-CENTURY RIFT WITH ORTHODOXY AS THE PINNACLE OF HIS 
PAPACY. END COMMENT). MERANTE

COTTIER, TO DISCUSS THE CLONING OF HUMAN BEINGS. COTTIER 
AFFIRMED THE VATICAN POSITION THAT CLONING IS IMMORAL IN 
EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE. HOWEVER, HE STRESSED THAT HUMAN BEINGS 
THAT RESULT FROM CLONING PROCEDURES MUST BE CONSIDERED EQUAL 
TO ANY OTHER PERSON IN REGARD TO RIGHTS AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES. (NOTE: TRANSLATED THEOLOGICALLY, FOR THE 
VATICAN THESE CLONES WILL HAVE THE SAME IMMORTAL SOULS THAT 
ALL HUMAN BEINGS POSSESS. END NOTE). COTTIER FIRMLY 
DISMISSED THE POSSIBILITY OF A SUB-HUMAN RACE OF CLONES. 
(NOTE: THE VATICAN ACCEPTS CLONING THERAPIES USING PLANTS 
AND ANIMALS WHEN THIS DIRECTLY BENEFITS HUMAN PERSONS IN 
TERMS OF FOOD AND HEALTH CARE, AS LONG AS ANIMAL RIGHTS AND 
BIO-DIVERSITY ARE RESPECTED. END NOTE). 
 
2.   COTTIER ACCEPTED THE LICITY OF CLONING INDIVIDUAL BODY 
PARTS FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. HE ALSO APPROVED OF THE USE 
OF ANIMAL ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANTATION INTO HUMANS, IF PROPER 
HEALTH SAFEGUARDS WERE FOLLOWED. COTTIER SAID THE USE OF 
ADULT STEM CELLS IN HEALTH-CARE THERAPIES WAS LEGITIMATE. HE 
CONDEMNED THE USE OF STEM CELLS FROM FETUSES DESTROYED BY 
THE TECHNIQUE. 
 
3.   COMMENT: FATHER COTTIER EXPRESSED HIS APPRECIATION THAT 
EMBASSY OFFICERS REPRESENTING THE USG HAD SHOWN FORESIGHTED 
INTEREST IN HUMAN CLONING. HE OPINED THAT WHILE THE 
TECHNIQUE SEEMED INEVITABLE, MOST GOVERNMENTS HAD FAILED TO 
ANTICIPATE ITS MORAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS. END

2.   VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS ANNOUNCED APRIL 
10 THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS WRITTEN TO UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX 
PATRIARCH VLADIMIR OF KIEV. THE SPOKESMAN DID NOT DIVULGE 
THE CONTENTS OF THE PRIVATE LETTER. VATICAN SOURCES SAY IT 
STRESSED THE ECUMENICAL NATURE OF THE PONTIFF\'S VISIT TO 
UKRAINE THIS SUMMER. CARDINAL ROBERTO TUCCI, THE OUTGOING 
DIRECTOR OF PAPAL TRAVEL, DELIVERED THE LETTER TO THE 
ORTHODOX PATRIARCH. TUCCI ALSO DELIVERED AN INVITATION FOR 
THE PATRIARCH TO ATTEND THE VATICAN\'S COMMEMORATION OF THE 
LAST HOURS OF THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST (STATIONS OF THE 
CROSS) AT ROME\'S COLISEUM ON APRIL 13. PATRIARCH VLADIMIR

ORTHODOX BISHOPS WHO ARE ALIGNED WITH THE PATRIARCHATE OF 
MOSCOW. HE URGED THE POPE NOT TO GO THROUGH WITH HIS PLANNED 
VISIT, SAYING IT WOULD COMPLICATE ECUMENICAL RELATIONS. 
WHILE THE CONTENTS OF THE PATRIARCH\'S LETTER WERE MADE 
PUBLIC IMMEDIATELY, THE VATICAN DID NOT OFFICIALLY RECEIVE A 
COPY UNTIL WEEKS LATER AND HAS NOW RESPONDED PRIVATELY. THE 
VATICAN HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT, DESPITE THE OBJECTIONS OF 
THE ORTHODOX LEADERS, THE POPE WILL NOT CHANGE HIS PLANS.

VATICAN RADIO: REDUCTION IN MEDIUM WAVE TRANSMISSIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3.   VATICAN RADIO ANNOUNCED APRIL 10 THAT IT WILL REDUCE 
THE NUMBER OF ITS MEDIUM WAVE BROADCASTS AFTER A JOINT 
VATICAN-ITALIAN COMMISSION DETERMINED THAT THE STATION 
VIOLATED ITALY\'S STRICT LIMITS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION. 
PRELIMINARY MEASUREMENTS TAKEN BY A JOINT TEAM OF 
TECHNICIANS FROM VATICAN RADIO AND THE ITALIAN MINISTRIES OF 
HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT CONFIRMED THAT SOME TRANSMISSION 
LEVELS EXCEEDED BY AS MUCH AS THREE TIMES THE ITALIAN LIMITS 
ON ELECTROMAGNETIC EMISSIONS. VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN 
NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THE RADIO REDUCED SIGNAL STRENGTH BY 50 
PERCENT IN FEBRUARY 2001, AND THAT CUTS IN BROADCASTING 
SCHEDULES WOULD BE MADE TO BRING LEVELS INTO LINE WITH 
ITALIAN STANDARDS. BROADCASTS VIA FM AND SHORT WAVE (HOW 
MOST OF THE WORLD RECEIVES THE RADIO\'S PROGRAMMING) WILL NOT 
BE AFFECTED BY THE CHANGES. VATICAN RADIO POINTED OUT THAT 
ITS TRANSMISSIONS CONFORM TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON 
ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY 14 
OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. ITALY PASSED MORE STRINGENT

REGULATIONS IN 1998. (COMMENT: EMBASSY CONTACTS AT VATICAN 
RADIO SAY THE REDUCTION IN TRANSMISSION SCHEDULES WILL HAVE 
MINIMAL IMPACT ON ITS OPERATION. THE RADIO HAS PLANNED FOR 
SOME TIME TO FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON SATELLITE AND INTERNET 
TECHNOLOGY TO PROPAGATE ITS MESSAGE. END COMMENT).

CHANGES TO POPE\'S EASTER PROGRAM 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.   THE VATICAN ANNOUNCED APRIL 10 THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II 
WILL NOT PARTICIPATE FULLY IN AN APRIL 13 COMMEMORATION OF 
THE LAST HOURS OF THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST (STATIONS OF THE 
CROSS) AT ROME\'S COLISEUM. THE INTERNATIONALLY TELEVISED 
EVENT IS A HIGHLIGHT OF THE VATICAN\'S EASTER WEEKEND 
PROGRAM. INSTEAD OF WALKING AROUND THE COLISEUM, THE POPE 
WILL REMAIN KNEELING THROUGHOUT THE CEREMONY. HE WILL CARRY 
A LIGHT WOODEN CROSS FOR THE FINAL FEW METERS OF THE 
PROCESSION AND THEN DELIVER HIS CUSTOMARY MESSAGE AT THE 
CONCLUSION OF THE SERVICE. THE CHANGE IN FORMAT IS A 
CONCESSION TO THE POPE\'S PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS.

MILLION DURING THE VATICAN\'S FY2000. THE MONEY WAS USED FOR 
EMERGENCY AID IN PLACES LIKE KOSOVO, MOZAMBIQUE AND ETHIOPIA 
AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN GEORGIA, CAMEROON AND PERU AMONG

THE FOUNDATION SENT MORE THAN US 2 MILLION FOR SEVERAL 
HUNDRED ARABLE LAND PRESERVATION PROJECTS. \"COR UNUM\'S\" 
PRESIDENT, GERMAN BORN ARCHBISHOP PAUL CORDES, DOWNPLAYED 
THE MONETARY FIGURE OF THE PAPAL DONATIONS SAYING THAT THE 
FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE POPE\'S GESTURES OF SOLIDARITY WITH 
THE POOR AND NEEDY. THE POPE RECEIVES HIS CHARITY FUNDING 
FROM AN ANNUAL WORLDWIDE COLLECTION IN CATHOLIC PARISHES AND 
FROM DONATIONS FROM DIOCESES, RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS AND 
PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS.

6.   THE VATICAN HAS EXPRESSED \"DISAPPOINTMENT\" OVER A 
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION CONDEMNING IT FOR ALLEGED 
INACTION IN THE FACE OF REPORTS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF NUNS BY 
PRIESTS. (REFTEL). THE VATICAN\'S OBSERVER AT THE PARLIAMENT, 
MONSIGNOR PAUL GALLAGHER, SAID THE VATICAN SHARED THE 
EUROPEAN BODY\'S CONCERN ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, AND IN

PARTICULAR CATHOLIC NUNS. HE OPINED THE RESOLUTION REFLECTED 
ANTI-VATICAN SENTIMENTS IN SOME QUARTERS OVER ABORTION AND 
CONTRACEPTION POLICY CONFLICTS. GALLAGHER NOTED THAT LESS 
THAN 20 PERCENT OF THE PARLIAMENT\'S MEMBERS TOOK PART IN THE 
VOTE BUT THAT \"ANY ACT OF A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION IS TO BE 
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.\" 
 
---------------------------------- 
VATICAN CABINET LEVEL APPOINTMENTS 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.   THE VATICAN HAS ANNOUNCED TWO SENIOR CABINET LEVEL 
APPOINTMENTS. CARDINAL CRESCENZIO SEPE IS TO TAKE THE REINS 
OF THE VATICAN\'S POWERFUL MISSIONARY OFFICE, THE 
CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLES, AND 
ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO MARIA VEGLIO BECOMES SECRETARY (NUMBER 2 
POSITION) OF THE CONGREGATION FOR THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES. 
CARDINAL SEPE WAS THE BRAINS AND THE ENERGY BEHIND THE 
VATICAN\'S SUCCESSFUL MILLENNIUM YEAR CELEBRATIONS. HE IS A 
CHARISMATIC FIGURE AND MEDIA-SAVVY. HIS CONSIDERABLE 
ORGANIZATIONAL AND FUND-RAISING ABILITY SHOULD RESULT IN THE 
POWER CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLES 
ASSUMING AN EVEN HIGHER PROFILE IN THE VATICAN GOVERNMENT. 
(NOTE: IT IS NO SECRET THAT SEPE IS A PAPAL FAVORITE AND HAS 
BEEN REWARDED FOR HIS Y2K ACCOMPLISHMENTS. WHEN PAPAL 
ADVISORS HEARD THAT SEPE WAS TO BE CREATED A CARDINAL 
FEBRUARY LAST, THEY COMMENTED THAT HE WAS TOO YOUNG - HE 
TURNS 58 THIS YEAR. POPE JOHN PAUL II REPLIED, \"I BECAME 
POPE AT THE SAME AGE!\" END NOTE). ARCHBISHOP VEGLIO IS 
PRESENTLY THE VATICAN\'S AMBASSADOR TO LEBANON AND KUWAIT, 
AND THE POPE\'S REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES ON 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02022  02 OF 03  121846Z 
THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. HE SUCCEEDS AN AGING AND RECLUSIVE 
UKRAINIAN ARCHBISHOP AS NUMBER TWO AT THE CONGREGATION FOR 
THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES (NOTE: THE CONGREGATION HANDLES ALL 
ISSUES RELATING TO THOSE CHRISTIANS WHO ARE NOW IN COMMUNION 
WITH ROME BUT USE EASTERN OR ORTHODOX-LIKE WORSHIP FORMS AND 
CHURCH ORGANIZATION. END NOTE). VEGLIO\'S LANGUAGE SKILLS AND 
DIPLOMATIC EXPERIENCE (HE HAS ALSO SERVED IN EUROPE, AFRICA, 
SOUTH AMERICA AND THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION) AUGUR WELL FOR A 
REVAMPING OF THE POSITION. (COMMENT: THE CONGREGATION FOR 
THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES IS SET TO TAKE ON GREATER IMPORTANCE 
IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF THE POPE JOHN PAUL\'S OUTREACH 
TO ORTHODOXY FOR WHOM THE EXISTENCE OF EASTERN RITE 
CATHOLICS IS A MAJOR STICKING POINT COMPLICATING EVENTUAL 
UNION WITH ROME. END COMMENT).

NEW PAPAL APPEAL FOR PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.   POPE JOHN PAUL II MADE AN URGENT NEW PLEA FOR PEACE IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST APRIL 18 AS HE CONCLUDED HIS REGULAR WEEKLY 
AUDIENCE. THE PONTIFF SAID THAT THE VOICE OF REASON AND 
CONSCIENCE MUST TAKE THE PLACE OF THE SOUND OF ARMS. HE 
ADDED THAT \"SINCERE ATTENTION TO THE LEGITIMATE ASPIRATIONS 
OF ALL PEOPLES AND SCRUPULOUS OBSERVANCE OF INTERNATIONAL 
LAW ARE THE ONLY MEANS CAPABLE OF LEADING THE SIDES BACK TO 
THE NEGOTIATING TABLES AND TRACING A PATH OF FRATERNITY FOR 
THOSE POPULATIONS.\" THE POPE REMARKED THAT WHILE THE 
CHRISTIAN WORLD ENJOYS EASTER, \"WE CANNOT FAIL TO FEEL 
SOLIDARITY TOWARD OUR BROTHERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHO ARE 
GOING THROUGH A MAELSTROM OF ARMED VIOLENCE AND VENGEANCE\". 
THE POPE\'S MESSAGE WAS HEADLINED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 
VATICAN\'S SEMI-OFFICIAL DAILY, \"L\'OSSERVATORE ROMANO.\"

3.   POPE JOHN PAUL II INCORPORATED SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS 
FROM ANCIENT BYZANTINE RITES INTO HIS EASTER MASS APRIL 15, 
MARKING THE CONVERGENCE OF WESTERN AND EASTERN CELEBRATIONS 
OF THE CHRISTIAN FEAST. THE PONTIFF VENERATED AN ANCIENT 
\"ACHEROPITA\" (NOT PAINTED BY HUMAN HANDS) ICON OF THE RISEN 
JESUS. LATER IN THE MASS A CHOIR OF RUSSIAN SEMINARY 
STUDENTS SANG THEOLOGICAL REFLECTIONS ON THE RESURRECTION 
SET TO A RUSSIAN MELODY. (COMMENT: THE BYZANTINE TOUCHES 
APPEAR TO BE PART OF A VATICAN PR EXERCISE IN PREPARATION 
FOR THE POPE\'S FORTHCOMING VISITS TO GREECE AND UKRAINE. THE 
MAJORITY OF CHRISTIANS IN BOTH COUNTRIES USE BYZANTINE FORMS 
OF WORSHIP. REUNIFICATION OF EUROPE\'S CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IS 
AT THE TOP OF POPE JOHN PAUL\'S WISH LIST. IT IS LIKELY THAT 
GESTURES, HOWEVER SMALL, SIGNALING OPENNESS TO THE EASTERN 
ORTHODOX WILL CONTINUE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE VATICAN\'S 
PUBLIC CEREMONIES, AT LEAST DURING THE PRESENT PONTIFICATE. 
END COMMENT).

POPE SKIPS POST-EASTER HOLIDAY 
------------------------------ 
 
4.   BREAKING WITH TRADITION, POPE JOHN PAUL CUT SHORT HIS 
POST-EASTER BREAK AND RETURNED TO VATICAN CITY APRIL 18 FOR 
HIS WEEKLY GENERAL AUDIENCE. EASTER WEEK EVENTS LEFT THE 
POPE VISIBLY FATIGUED AND AT TIMES HE APPEARED ON THE VERGE 
OF COLLAPSE. DESPITE THE RIGORS, VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN 
NAVARRO-VALLS ANNOUNCED THAT THE 80-YEAR OLD POPE WOULD 
SPEND ONLY TWO DAYS AT HIS RETREAT 25 KILOMETERS OUTSIDE OF 
ROME.

5.   POPE JOHN PAUL HAS APPOINTED ARCHBISHOP PAOLO ROMEO AS 
HIS AMBASSADOR (NUNCIO) TO ITALY AND THE REPUBLIC OF SAN 
MARINO. ROMEO IS CURRENTLY PAPAL REPRESENTATIVE IN CANADA. A 
34-YEAR VETERAN OF THE VATICAN DIPLOMATIC SERVICE, 
ARCHBISHOP ROMEO HAS SERVED AS NUNCIO TO COLOMBIA AND HAITI. 
HIS OTHER POSTINGS IN LESSER CAPACITIES HAVE INCLUDED THE 
PHILIPPINES, BELGIUM, VENEZUELA AND RWANDA. HE ALSO WORKED 
IN THE VATICAN\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY. BORN IN 1938 IN SICILY, 
ROMEO WAS ORDAINED A PRIEST IN 1961. HE HOLDS A DOCTORATE IN 
CANON LAW AND ENTERED THE VATICAN\'S DIPLOMATIC SERVICE IN 
1967. HE SPEAKS FRENCH, SPANISH, ENGLISH AND GERMAN, AS WELL 
AS HIS NATIVE ITALIAN. MERANTE

MERANTE.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY: THERE IS NO NEW INFORMATION SUGGESTING 
AN IMMINENT PAPAL DEMISE, BUT THE POPE\'S HEALTH 
APPEARS TO CONTINUE ITS DECLINE. POST OFFERS SOME 
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USG\'S ACTIONS SURROUNDING THE 
PAPAL FUNERAL AND ELECTION OF A NEW POPE.  THE USG 
WOULD HAVE NINE DAYS FROM THE DEATH OF THE POPE TO 
FORM AND SEND A PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION TO THE FUNERAL 
MASS IN THE VATICAN AND POSSIBLY THE POPE\'S NATIVE 
POLAND. END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C) ALTHOUGH POST HAS NO NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
POPE\'S HEALTH THAT IMPELS THE TIMING OF THIS CABLE, 
THE POPE\'S STATE OF HEALTH IS WELL-KNOWN AND THE 
PROSPECT OF A PAPAL FUNERAL AND A SUBSEQUENT ELECTION 
ARE ON THE NEARER RATHER THAN THE FARTHER HORIZON. 
POST WISHES THE DEPARTMENT NOT TO BE SURPRISED BY 
PROTOCOL URGENCIES ON SHORT NOTICE.  AFTER THE DEATH 
OF A POPE, THERE IS A PERIOD OF MOURNING OF NINE DAYS 
BEFORE THE FUNERAL MASS, WHICH WOULD BE ATTENDED BY 
HEADS OF STATE OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.  THE PROCESS 
FOR ELECTING THE NEW POPE WILL BEGIN AFTER BURIAL. 
 
--------------------------- 
BACKGROUND: THE INTERREGNUM 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) WHEN THE POPE DIES, THE PREFECT OF THE PAPAL 
HOUSEHOLD (CURRENTLY AMERICAN BISHOP JAMES HARVEY) 
INFORMS THE CARDINAL CHAMBERLAIN (CURRENTLY SPANISH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  02295  01 OF 04  270100Z 
CARDINAL EDUARDO MARTINEZ SOMALO), WHO MUST VERIFY THE 
DEATH, ARRANGE FOR A DEATH CERTIFICATE AND INFORM THE 
CARDINAL-VICAR OF ROME (CURRENTLY ITALIAN CARDINAL 
CAMILLO RUINI).  THE CARDINAL-VICAR MAKES THE DEATH 
PUBLIC; VATICAN RADIO THEN BROADCASTS THE NEWS.  THE 
VATICAN PRESS OFFICE WOULD PROBABLY HOLD A PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT DAY.  THE CARDINAL-CHAMBERLAIN THEN 
LOCKS AND SEALS THE POPE\'S PRIVATE APARTMENTS.  THE 
CARDINAL CHAMBERLAIN, ON BEHALF OF THE COLLEGE OF 
CARDINALS ASSUMES RESPONSIBILITY \"AD INTERIM\" FOR 
CHURCH GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE FUNERAL AND BURIAL OF 
THE POPE AND THE ELECTION OF HIS SUCCESSOR. THREE 
CARDINAL ASSISTANTS, SELECTED BY LOT FROM AMONG 
CARDINALS ALREADY IN ROME, HELP THE CHAMBERLAIN.  THE 
HEADS OF VATICAN GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS, WITH SOME 
EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS THE CHAMBERLAIN HIMSELF ARE 
SUSPENDED FROM EXERCISING THEIR AUTHORITY.  THE PAPAL 
FUNERAL RITES CONTINUE FOR NINE CONSECUTIVE DAYS. 
 
--------------------------------- 
TWO FUNERALS? AND AN INAUGURATION 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) POST RECOMMENDS THAT THE PRESIDENT ATTEND THE 
PONTIFF\'S FUNERAL SERVICES IN THE VATICAN.  IT IS VERY 
POSSIBLE THAT THE POPE\'S WILL DIRECTS THAT HE BE 
BURIED IN HIS NATIVE POLAND, A REQUEST THAT THE 
VATICAN WOULD HONOR, WE BELIEVE.  THE WHITE HOUSE 
SHOULD THUS CONSIDER THAT THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR 
ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION FOR BURIAL SERVICES IN 
POLAND.  IN ADDITION, WE RECOMMEND A HIGH-LEVEL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02295  01 OF 04  270100Z 
PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION OF EIGHT OR NINE TO THE 
INAUGURATION OF THE NEW POPE, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS 
OCCURRED WITHIN THE WEEK FOLLOWING THE BURIAL. 
 
----------------------- 
WHO ATTENDS THE FUNERAL 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  WITH A POPE AS ACTIVE IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND 
WHO HAS VISITED MORE NATIONS THAN ANY OTHER PONTIFF, 
THE PAPAL FUNERAL WOULD PROBABLY BE ATTENDED BY MANY 
HEADS OF STATE.  JOHN PAUL II HAS MET MANY CURRENT 
WORLD LEADERS PERSONALLY, AND WE EXPECT THAT MANY OF 
THEM WILL COME TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS. THE NINE-DAY 
NOTICE OF A PAPAL FUNERAL WILL PUT HOTEL SPACE AT A 
PREMIUM.  HOTELS WILL HAVE TO TURN RESERVED GUESTS 
AWAY.  HOTELS ARE REPORTED TO HAVE ALREADY AGREED WITH 
SOME MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS TO TURN OUT GUESTS TO ALLOW 
THE PRESS TO TAKE ROOMS.  WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

-------------------------- 
THE CONCLAVE: PREPARATIONS 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) CARDINALS WILL ARRIVE IN ROME FROM THE WORLD 
OVER; THEY WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH HOTEL SPACE, AS 
THEY WILL STAY IN THE DOMUS SANTA MARTA FACILITY, 
INSIDE THE VATICAN AND REBUILT RECENTLY FOR THEIR USE. 
PREVIOUS CONCLAVES INVOLVED THE CARDINALS STAYING IN 
CRAMPED ROOMS NEAR THE SISTINE CHAPEL.  EVEN WHILE THE 
FUNERAL RITES ARE GOING ON, THE CARDINALS MEET IN 
\"GENERAL CONGREGATIONS\" ORGANIZED BY THE CHAMBERLAIN. 
AT THIS TIME THE CARDINALS WOULD LIKELY BEGIN 
INFORMALLY TO DISCUSS CANDIDATES FOR THE PAPACY. 
 
-------------------- 
THE CONCLAVE: VOTING 
-------------------- 
 
8.  (C) THOSE CARDINALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE MUST 
BEGIN TO DO SO NO EARLIER THAN FIFTEEN AND NO LATER 
THAN TWENTY DAYS AFTER THE DEATH OF THE POPE.  NEWS 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ALREADY OPTIONED CHOICE LOCATIONS 
TO STAKE OUT THE VOTING. THE CONCLAVE PROPER BEGINS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  02295  02 OF 04  270101Z 
WITH A MORNING MASS IN ST PETER\'S BASILICA, AFTER 
WHICH THE CARDINALS GO TO THE SISTINE CHAPEL, WHERE 
THEY TAKE AN OATH TO FOLLOW THE ELECTION RULES 
(CHANGED BY POPE JOHN PAUL II).  THEN THEY CAST THE 
FIRST VOTE. 
 
--------------------- 
HOW LONG IT WILL LAST 
---------------------- 
 
9.  (C) THERE IS NO LIMIT ON HOW LONG THE VOTING MAY 
GO ON, BUT IN PRACTICE, IT LIKELY WILL BE A MATTER OF 
DAYS.  NONE OF THE TEN CONCLAVES SINCE 1831 LASTED 
MORE THAN FOUR DAYS. WHEN A CANDIDATE RECEIVES THE 
REQUISITE MAJORITY (WHICH VARIES ACCORDING TO HOW MANY 
TIMES VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST), THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE 
OF CARDINALS FORMALLY ASKS THE WINNER IF HE ACCEPTS 
ELECTION AND BY WHAT NAME HE WISHES TO BE CALLED.  THE 
CONCLAVE IS THEN OFFICIALLY OVER. 
 
------------ 
SMOKE RISING 
------------ 
 
10.  (C) ORDINARILY, THE FIRST INDICATION TO THE 
OUTSIDE WORLD THAT A NEW POPE HAS BEEN ELECTED COMES 
WHEN A PLUME OF WHITE SMOKE RISES FROM THE SISTINE 
CHAPEL AS THE LAST BALLOTS ARE BURNT.  (FOR BALLOTS 
THAT DO NOT RESULT IN THE NEEDED MAJORITY, A CHEMICAL 
MIXED WITH THE BALLOTS GIVES THEM A DARK APPEARANCE 
WHEN THEY ARE BURNT.)  NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WITH PRIME 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02295  02 OF 04  270101Z 
LOCATIONS WILL BE VIDEOTAPING SMOKE RISING FROM THE 
SISTINE CHAPEL.  THESE ORGANIZATIONS WITH THEIR ROUND- 
THE-CLOCK STAKEOUTS WILL FURTHER EXACERBATE THE HOTEL 
ROOM SHORTAGE WE PREDICT FOR ROME.  THE MEDIA WILL 
WAIT TO CAPTURE ON TAPE THE SENIOR CARDINAL DEACON 
PROCLAIMING THE ELECTION ON THE MAIN BALCONY FROM ST 
PETERS, OVERLOOKING THE SQUARE WHEN THE NEW POPE 
APPEARS TO IMPART HIS BLESSING. 
 
------------- 
NO CORONATION 
-------------- 
 
11.  (C) POPE JOHN PAUL I (WHOSE REIGN LASTED 33 DAYS) 
DISCONTINUED THE ELABORATE CORONATION CEREMONY 
PRESCRIBED BY HIS PREDECESSORS.  THE NEXT POPE\'S 
ELECTION, LIKE THOSE OF JOHN PAUL I AND JOHN PAUL II 
IN 1978, SHOULD BE COMPLETED AND CELEBRATED BY TWO 
EVENTS.  FIRST, THERE WILL MOST LIKELY BE A PUBLIC 
\"SOLEMN CEREMONY OF INAUGURATION\" OF THE NEW PAPACY. 
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE NEW POPE WOULD TAKE FORMAL 
POSSESSION OF HIS PATRIARCHAL BASILICA, WHICH IS ST 
JOHN LATERAN, THE \"CATHEDRAL\" OF ROME, IN A CEREMONY 
INVOLVING A PONTIFICAL MASS THERE.  THE VATICAN WOULD 
NOT EXPECT A HEAD OF STATE TO ATTEND THESE MASSES IF 
S/HE ATTENDED THE FUNERAL, BUT A DELEGATION FROM THE 
HEAD OF STATE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO ATTEND.  EMBASSY 
VATICAN SUGGESTS A TEN-PERSON DELEGATION.

HOUSING FOR A PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION 
------------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) WE RECOMMEND THAT THE WHITE HOUSE CONSIDER 
THE RESIDENCE OF THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE 
FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S USE DURING HIS STAY.  THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE HAS TWO EXTRA BEDROOMS, WITH 
ONE OTHER ROOM USABLE AS A SLEEPING ROOM.  THE 
RESIDENCE HAS A 24-HOUR GUARD AND GATED ENTRY.  THE 
RESIDENCE HAS A TOTAL OF 1400 SQUARE METERS (15,246 
SQUARE FEET). 
 
13.  (C) IF THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT STAY AT THE 
RESIDENCE, WE SUGGEST HOTELS WHICH ARE CLOSE TO THE 
VATICAN, DUE TO PROJECTED EXTREME TRAFFIC CONGESTION: 
- CAVALIERE HILTON - 4.6 KLOMETERS FROM THE VATICAN - 
312 ROOMS TOTAL.  THERE ARE 17 SUITES IN ALL, TWO OF 
WHICH ARE \"PRESIDENTIAL\" AND ONE \"ROYAL.\" 
- HOLIDAY INN ST PETER\'S - 4.5 KM FROM THE VATICAN)- 
300 ROOMS, AND 25 EXECUTIVE ROOMS. 
- HOTEL MINERVA - (2.5 M FROM THE VATICAN)- WITH 118 
ROOMS AND 16 SUITES. 
- HOTEL AMBASCIATORI - 4 KM FROM THE VATICAN -WITH 
150 ROOMS AND 8 SUITES. 
- EXCELSIOR HOTEL- 4 KM FROM THE VATICAN - WITH 318 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  02295  03 OF 04  270102Z 
ROOMS AND 15 SUITES. 
- ST. REGIS GRAND HOTEL - 4 KM FROM THE VATICAN - WITH 
161 ROOMS AND 6 SUITES. 
 
------------------------------------- 
GETTING A HOTEL ROOM WILL NOT BE EASY 
------------------------------------- 
 
14.  (SBU) FOLLOWING MEDIA REPORTS OVER THE PAST 
SEVERAL YEARS AND CULMINATING IN RECENT ARTICLES, 
MAJOR NEWS ORGANIZATIONS ARE PLANNING FOR PERSON- 
INTENSIVE OPERATIONS, WITH ROUND-THE-CLOCK STAKEOUTS 
OF THE VATICAN.  THEY WILL NEED HUNDREDS OF HOTEL 
ROOMS.  IT WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE U.S. DELEGATION TO 
MAKE HOTEL RESERVATIONS IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEARNING OF 
THE POPE\'S DEATH.  IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE COMES FOR 
ONE OF THE MASSES, HOTEL SPACE WILL BE EVEN MORE IN 
DEMAND. 
 
15.  (SBU) IN ADDITION TO THE MEDIA HORDES THAT WILL 
DESCEND ON ROME, MOST NATIONS WILL SEND TOP LEVEL 
DELEGATIONS WITH MANY HEADS OF STATE.  DUE TO A 
COMBINATION OF FACTORS, THIS POPE\'S FUNERAL MAY 
ATTRACT THE LARGEST NUMBER OF OFFICIAL VISITORS FOR 
ANY PAPAL FUNERAL IN HISTORY.  OVER TWENTY YEARS OF 
HIGH-PROFILE INVOLVEMENT IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS, THE MOST 
FOREIGN TRAVEL OF ANY POPE IN HISTORY, THE GREAT 
NUMBER OF PERSONAL MEETINGS BETWEEN THIS POPE AND 
EXISTING HEADS OF STATE OR GOVERNMENT - ALL THESE 
ARGUE FOR THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTAL 
REPRESENTATION, ACCOMPANIED BY THE INEVITABLE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02295  03 OF 04  270102Z 
ENTOURAGES. 
 
16.  (C) FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE FUNERAL MASS FOR JOHN 
PAUL I, WHOSE 33 DAYS AS POPE HARDLY GAVE HIM THE TIME 
TO BUILD UP THE RESPECT AND GOODWILL ENJOYED BY HIS 
SUCCESSOR, APPROXIMATELY 47 COUNTRIES SENT 
DELEGATIONS. (MANY OTHER NATIONS SENT THEIR RESIDENT 
AMBASSADORS) 117 MISSIONS (NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL) 
WERE REPRESENTED.  121 MISSIONS SENT REPRESENTATIVES 
FOR THE MASS CELEBRATING THE BEGINNING OF JOHN PAUL 
II\'S MINISTRY AS PONTIFF A FEW WEEKS LATER.  109 
MISSIONS SENT REPRESENTATIVES TO THE MASS FOR THE 
BEGINNING OF JOHN PAUL I\'S PAPACY, WITH 110 MISSIONS 
REPRESENTED AT THE FUNERAL MASS FOR PAUL VI.  SINCE 
THE 1979 ROUND OF FUNERAL AND ELECTION  MASSES, THE 
VATICAN HAS ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH EVEN 
MORE NATIONS.  THERE WILL CLEARLY BE A HEAVY INFLUX OF 
FOREIGN DIGNITARIES AND THEIR ENTOURAGES, NOT TO 
MENTION ITALIAN OFFICIALS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
AND HORDES FROM POLAND.

19.  (U) EMBASSIES ROME AND VATICAN WOULD MAKE 
VEHICLES AVAILABLE FOR THE VISIT.  THERE ARE A NUMBER 
OF LARGE RENTAL VEHICLE COMPANIES (HERTZ, EUROPCAR,

ON APRIL 28.  AFFIRMING THAT THE \"INNOCENT\" PEOPLE OF IRAQ 
SHOULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
\"DESTRUCTIVE WAR WHOSE AFFECTS ARE STILL BEING FELT BY THOSE 
WHO ARE WEAKEST AND MOST VULNERABLE,\" THE POPE QUOTED FROM A

PRODUCE.\"

SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THAT DURING HIS TRIP TO 
ATHENS, POPE JOHN PAUL II WILL EMPHASIZE THE FAITH THAT 
UNITES CATHOLIC AND GREEK ORTHODOX BELIEVERS, RATHER THAN 
THEIR DIFFERENCES.  SEEKING TO AVOID DISCUSSION OF GREEK 
ORTHODOX PROTESTS THAT HAVE MARRED THE TRIP\'S PREPARATIONS, 
NAVARRO-VALLS HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE POPE WILL MAKE THREE 
JOINT APPEARANCES WITH THE GREEK ORTHODOX METROPOLITAN 
CHRISTODOULOS OF ATHENS, INCLUDING AN \"HISTORIC\" READING OF 
THE TEXT OF ST. PAUL AT THE AREOPAGUS.  ALTHOUGH THE VISIT 
IS UNLIKELY TO PRODUCE ANY \"GREAT AGREEMENTS,\" THE SPOKESMAN 
SAID THAT THERE WAS HOPE THAT THE SYMBOLIC GESTURES BETWEEN 
THE TWO RELIGIOUS LEADERS COULD HELP TO OVERCOME SUSPICIONS 
AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS.  HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE POPE 
HAS VISITED GREECE BEFORE, WHILE SERVING AS ARCHBISHOP TO 
KRAKOW. IN A HIGHLY UNUSUAL STEP, INDICATIVE OF THE 
VATICAN\'S EFFORT TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE ASPECTS 
OF THE TRIP, THE VATICAN PRESS OFFICE PUBLISHED A TRANSCRIPT 
OF THE INTERVIEW. IN A CONVERSATION WITH CHARGE ON OTHER 
ISSUES 05/04, VATICAN DFM MIGLIORE SHARED THE HOLY SEE\'S 
\"HURT\" AT THE VITRIOL DIRECTED AT THE PERSON OF THE POPE BY 
CERTAIN RADICAL QUARTERS OF THE GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - IN 
SOME CASES DEMONIZING HIM FOR THE SCHISM OF 1054. IN 
MIGLIORE\'S WORDS, THIS WAS NOT \"CIVILIZED\" BEHAVIOR. HE 
AVERRED HOWEVER THAT THE VISIT WOULD IN THE END BE A 
SUCCESS.

5.   (U) IN AN APRIL 27 SPEECH FOCUSING ON THE DANGERS OF 
GLOBALIZATION, POPE JOHN PAUL II TOLD AN AUDIENCE OF ABOUT 
FIFTY INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN ACADEMICS PARTICIPATING IN THE 
ANNUAL PLENARY MEETING OF THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY OF SOCIAL 
SCIENCES THAT GLOBALIZATION HAS IN ITSELF BECOME A NEW 
CULTURE, DISPLACING LOCAL CULTURES AND REDUCING THE VALUE OF 
HUMAN BEINGS TO THEIR ECONOMIC USEFULNESS.  THE POPE URGED 
WORLD LEADERS TO CONTROL THE FORCES OF THIS \"NEW VERSION OF 
COLONIALISM\" AND TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, 
CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  HOWEVER, THE POPE 
REFUSED TO OVERSIMPLIFY GLOBALIZATION IN TERMS OF GOOD OR 
BAD.  \"IT WILL BE WHAT PEOPLE MAKE OF IT,\" HE SAID.

1.  (U)  THIS CABLE CONTAINS A GUIDANCE REQUEST -- PLEASE 
SEE PARA FIVE. 
 
2. (C)  PURSUANT TO REF C, CHARGE AND A/DCM MET IN THE 
AFTERNOON OF 5/4 WITH SANT\'EGIDIO FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR 
ANDREA RICCARDI TO DISCUSS HOW TO PUSH THE PACE OF THE 
PROPOSED INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE FOR BOSNIA.  RICCARDI\'S 
ASSISTANT, CLAUDIO BETTI, HAD HEARD FROM CARDINAL PULJIC 
(THE KEY INTERLOCUTOR IN THIS DIALOGUE) THAT PULJIC 
SUPPORTS THE CONFERENCE BUT THAT THE EARLIEST HE CAN ATTEND 
WOULD BE JUNE 7-8.  SANT\'EGIDIO IS PUSHING AHEAD TO CONFIRM 
THE OTHER INVITEES FOR THAT DATE.  A/DCM REMINDED RICCARDI 
THAT THE IMPENDING HDZ DECLARATION OF A SEPARATE ENTITY IN 
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA HAS LENT SOME URGENCY TO THE CONFERENCE, 
BUT RICCARDI INSISTED THAT TO HAVE A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE 
PULJIC NEEDED TO BE FULLY ON BOARD, AND JUNE 7 IS THE BEST 
THEY CAN DO. 
3.  (C)  RICCARDI TOLD US THAT SANT\'EGIDIO WOULD IN THE 
MEANTIME HAVE OTHER MEETINGS WITH THE CARDINAL IN WHICH 
THEY WOULD PRESS HIM TO TAKE A MODERATE LINE VIS A VIS THE 
HDZ GAMBIT.  DON VICENZO PAGLIA WILL SEE PULJIC SOON FOR A 
CONFIRMATION IN BOSNIA; RICCARDI SAID THAT DON VICENZO WILL 
PRESS FOR MODERATION, AS WILL RICCARDI HIMSELF WHEN HE SEES 
PULJIC DURING THE 5/23 CONSISTORY IN ROME.  RICCARDI 
BELIEVED THAT THE FACT THAT PULJIC ACCEPTED THE IDEA OF AN 
OFF-SITE CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS INTERCOMMUNAL RECONCILIATION 
INDICATES THAT PULJIC IS \"LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT OF THE

4.  (C) PER REF B, CHARGE CALLED UK AMBASSADOR PELLEW IN 
THE MORNING OF 5/4 TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT THAT THE 
PROJECT IS SANT\'EGIDIO\'S.  (NOTE:  POST HAS PUSHED 
AGGRESSIVELY FOR THE CONFERENCE TO OCCUR ASAP, AS WELL AS 
FOR CO-FUNDING OF THE CONFERENCE, AND HAS SECURED A PLEDGE 
FROM THE AUSTRIAN EMBASSY HERE TO PROVIDE AIR TRANSPORT FOR 
THE BOSNIANS AS WELL AS A PLEDGE FROM THE SWEDISH EMBASSY 
(EU PRESIDENCY) TO CO-FUND THE REMAINDER OF THE EXPENSES. 
BUT THE TIME HAS COME FOR SANT\'EGIDIO TO TAKE THE REINS. 
END NOTE.)  PELLEW (PLEASE PROTECT), PERHAPS REFLECTING 
FRUSTRATION THAT HIS MISSION HAS BEEN OUT OF THE LOOP, TOLD 
US SANT\'EGIDIO IS MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN GIVEN SUFFICIENT LEAD 
TO DO THINGS IN THEIR OWN WAY (READ: SLOWLY AND WITH GREAT 
DELIBERATION).  HE WASN\'T CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE 
TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL EVENT IF \"PRESSURIZED\" BY THE USG.  WE 
LATER ASSURED RICCARDI THAT WE SEE THIS AS A SANT\'EGIDIO 
PROJECT, AND THAT WE WERE THERE TO HELP AS NEEDED.  HE TOO 
BELIEVED THAT WAS THE BEST APPROACH, AND SAID SANT\'EGIDIO 
WOULD COORDINATE AMONG THE OTHER EMBASSIES INVOLVED.  POST 
WILL NOT HESITATE TO JUMP BACK IN, HOWEVER, IF SANT\'EGIDIO 
LOOKS LIKE IT IS DROPPING THE BALL. 
 
5.  (SBU)  RICCARDI SUGGESTED THAT WE SEE PULJIC WHEN HE IS 
HERE -- WE CAN DO SO AND WOULD APPRECIATE GUIDANCE FROM 
DEPARTMENT/EMBASSY SARAJEVO ON WHETHER TO DO SO AND LATEST

2.  (C) POLOFF USED OCCASION TO DISCUSS PRC DETENTION 
OF UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC CLERGY, RAISING THE CASE OF

DECLINED TO STATE WHETHER THE VATICAN HAD RECEIVED 
INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION.  HE SHOWED ONLY SUBDUED 
CONCERN, NOTING THAT DETENTIONS OF THIS NATURE WERE 
ROUTINE FOR THE EASTER AND CHRISTMAS SEASON AND 
CONSTITUTED A FORM OF HABITUAL STATE HARASSMENT. ROTA- 
GRAZIOSI APPEARED OBLIVIOUS TO USG AND OTHER 
DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES ON BEHALF OF BISHOP SHI.  WHILE 
HE WELCOMED USG INTEREST IN BISHOP SHI AND OTHER 
DETAINED CLERGY, ROTA-GRAZIOSI NEITHER REQUESTED NOR 
PROVIDED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  HE STRESSED THAT THE

RAPPROCHEMENT WAS AT AN IMPASSE.  HE LAMENTED THE 
DISASTROUS CHOICE OF DATE -- OCTOBER 1, CHINESE 
NATIONAL DAY - FOR THE MASS BEATIFICATION OF CHINESE 
MARTYRS IN A VATICAN CEREMONY.  HE INSISTED THIS WAS A 
BUREAUCRATIC BLUNDER CAUSED BY THE COMPLICATED 
CALENDAR OF EVENTS IN THE JUBILEE YEAR, A REMARK 
MISSION HAS HEARD REPEATEDLY WITHIN VATICAN CIRCLES. 
HE REGRETTED THAT THE PRC CHOSE TO EXPLOIT THE 
VATICAN\'S CHOICE OF DATE AS A PRETEXT TO ASSAIL THE

THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH SIMILARLY BEATIFIED

THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S HEALTH PROBLEMS CAUSED SOME CONCERN 
DURING HIS VISIT TO GREECE, SYRIA AND MALTA. CONFIRMING THE 
POPE WAS \"EXHAUSTED,\" NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THE PONTIFF\'S 
NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION AND HIS AGE TELLS THE WORLD THAT 
\"THIS BLESSED FATIGUE IS WORTH IT.\" HE SPECULATED THAT 
FUTURE POPES WOULD RECALL THE EXAMPLE OF JOHN PAUL II AND 
\"THE IMPLICIT MESSAGE THAT, DESPITE THE PAIN AND FATIGUE HE 
SUFFERED, THEY WILL SEE HOW MUCH GOD ALLOWED HIM TO 
ACCOMPLISH.\" EMBASSY CONTACTS ACCOMPANYING THE POPE ON HIS 
TRIP SAID HE STRUGGLED MORE THAN USUAL BUT THAT HIS TENACITY 
AND DRIVE REMAIN INTACT, JOKING AT TIMES WITH THE PRESS 
POOL. THE VATICAN SPOKESMAN SAID THE POPE HAS NO PLANS TO 
CURTAIL HIS TRAVEL SCHEDULE (UKRAINE IN JUNE, ARMENIA IN 
SEPTEMBER, CANADA IN THE SUMMER OF 2002, PLUS TWO MORE 
COUNTRIES THAT YEAR). NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THAT THE POPE \"WILL

3.   VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS DECLARED THE 
PAPAL VISIT TO GREECE, SYRIA AND MALTA AS MORE THAN 
SATISFACTORY. PARTICULARLY PLEASING FOR THE VATICAN WAS THE 
POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM THE GREEK ORTHODOX ARCHBISHOP OF 
ATHENS TO THE PONTIFF\'S VISIT TO GREECE. ARCHBISHOP 
CHRISTODOULOS GAVE THE POPE A COURTEOUS WELCOME, THANKED HIM 
FOR HIS VISIT AND PROMISED HIS PRAYERS IN SUPPORT OF THE 
REMAINDER OF THE PAPAL TRIP. NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THE POPE DID 
NOT EXPECT THE GESTURE AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO \"PROVIDENCE.\" 
THE SPOKESMAN CONTINUED THAT POPE JOHN PAUL WAS DELIGHTED 
WITH HIS TRIP TO GREECE AND THAT \"TWO MONTHS AGO, THIS TRIP 
WAS UNTHINKABLE.\" HE EFFUSED THAT \"ONCE AGAIN THE POPE DOES 
NOT LET HISTORY HAPPEN BUT HAS DIRECTED IT.\" WHEN ASKED 
WHETHER THE EXPERIENCE IN GREECE AUGURED WELL FOR A LONGED- 
FOR PAPAL TRIP TO MOSCOW, NAVARRO-VALLS ANSWERED, \"WE\'LL 
SPEAK ABOUT THAT IN TWO MONTHS.\" (COMMENT: THE VATICAN WILL 
WANT TO WAIT FOR THE OUTCOME OF THE POPE\'S VISIT TO UKRAINE 
IN JUNE BEFORE MAKING FURTHER COMMENTS ABOUT A VISIT TO 
MOSCOW. END COMMENT). 
 
4.   NAVARRO-VALLS WAS CAREFUL TO DEPOLITICIZE THE SYRIAN 
LEG OF THE POPE\'S PILGRIMAGE. NAVARRO-VALLS DISTANCED THE 
VATICAN FROM PRESIDENT ASSAD\'S REMARKS AT THE WELCOME 
CEREMONY. HE SAID THE POPE HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT 
ASSAD WOULD SAY AND THAT THE VATICAN\'S RESPONSE WAS 
CONTAINED IN THE PONTIFF\'S SPEECH \"ENUNCIATING INTERNATIONAL 
PRINCIPLES THAT APPLY TO ALL.\" COMMENTING ON THE PONTIFF\'S 
VISIT TO QUNEITRA, HE SAID THE \"SOLE OBJECTIVE AND THE SOLE 
REASON WAS TO PRAY FOR PEACE.\" THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT 
\"PEOPLE OF GOODWILL WILL UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE\" THE 
POPE\'S GESTURE. NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THE POPE WAS MOVED BY THE

RESPECT AND AFFECTION SHOWN HIM BY SYRIAN MOSLEMS, ADDING 
THAT JOHN PAUL II WAS AWARE OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FIRST 
VISIT BY A POPE TO A MOSQUE. HE SAID POPE JOHN PAUL HOPED IT 
WOULD BEAR NEW FRUIT IN THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE 
CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM.

THINGS ARE GOING WELL IN OUR COUNTRY, YOUTH FIND WORK EASILY 
AND ARE NOT INTERESTED IN COMING TO ROME TO SERVE THE POPE,\"

POLITICIANS (REF A), POST HAS TRIED TO CONFIRM THAT THE 
HOLY SEE WILL RESPOND POSITIVELY TO THE REQUEST BY 
FEDERATION OFFICIALS FOR AN INVITATION TO VISIT THE VATICAN 
(REF B).  AS YET, WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PIN DOWN OUR 
INTERLOCUTORS IN THE SECOND SECRETARIAT (MFA) ON WHETHER OR 
WHEN AN INVITATION WILL BE FORTHCOMING.  WE HAVE 
NEVERTHELESS ASSURED THEM WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A GOOD 
IDEA TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO THE REQUEST.  IN RESPONSE TO 
POLOFF\'S QUERY 5/14, DFM MIGLIORE SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW 
FOR CERTAIN IF A VISIT BY FEDERATION OFFICIALS WAS IN THE 
WORKS, BUT THAT HE HAD HEARD A RUMOR ABOUT SOME BOSNIANS 
VISITING.  HE THOUGHT THE VATICAN WOULD WANT TO GO SLOWLY, 
SINCE THEY WERE NOT SURE OF THE SITUATION IN HERZEGOVINA 
AND WOULDN\'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO MAKE THINGS WORSE. 
2.  (C)  VATICAN BALKANS DIRECTOR JOSEPH MARINO TOLD POLOFF

CROAT MODERATES, BUT HE SHARED WITH CHARGE LATER 5/16 THAT

1. (C)  SUMMARY:  HENRY KISSINGER MET WITH VATICAN PRIME 
MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER ON MAY 22.   THE VATICAN 
STRESSED THE NEED FOR AN \"INTERNATIONAL FORCE\" TO KEEP THE 
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS APART.  IN A SUBSEQUENT 
CONVERSATION, ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TOLD CHARGE THAT THE 
VATICAN IS NOW PROPOSING AN INTERNATIONAL FORCE.  IN 
ADDITION, IT PLANS TO SEND A \"SPECIAL ENVOY\" TO ISRAEL AND 
THE TERRITORIES.  JERUSALEM HAS REACTED COOLLY TO BOTH 
PROPOSALS.  VATICAN RESPONSE TO REFTEL FOCUSED ON NEED FOR 
IMMEDIATE STOP TO VIOLENCE LEST \"HABITS OF WAR\" BECOME SET. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HENRY KISSINGER VISITED 
VATICAN CITY MAY 22-23.  HE WAS IN ITALY IN HIS CAPACITY AS 
THE CHAIR OF THE ADVISORY BOARD OF BOOZ/ALLEN, WHICH WAS 
HOLDING ITS ANNUAL MEETING.  DR. KISSINGER MET VATICAN 
PRIME MINISTER SODANO AND FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN EVENING 
OF MAY 22.  KISSINGER BRIEFED CHARGE MORNING OF MAY 23. 
THE FORMER SECRETARY SAID THAT THE MEETING FOCUSED ON THE 
SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  THE VATICAN REPEATED ITS 
CALL FOR INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES FOR THE HOLY SITES, AND 
GAVE DR. KISSINGER A NON-PAPER (FAXED TO EUR/WE MAY 24). 
IN ADDITION, SODANO AND TAURAN STRESSED THE NEED FOR AN 
\"INTERNATIONAL FORCE\" TO KEEP THE ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS 
APART.  CHARGE ACCOMPANIED DR. KISSINGER TO A PRESENTATION 
TO THE POPE ON THE MORNING OF MAY 23.  THE POPE LOOKED 
EXTREMELY WEAK, AND APPEARED NOT TO RECOGNIZE DR. 
KISSINGER.  AFTER THE THREE MINUTE MEETING WITH THE POPE, 
DR. KISSINGER REMARKED TO THE CHARGE THAT THE POPE SEEMED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  02867  251557Z 
TO BE UNAWARE OF HIS IDENTITY. 
 
3.  (C) CHARGE SPOKE TO ISRAELI AMBASSADOR JOSEPH LAMDAN 
EVENING OF MAY 23.  THE AMBASSADOR USED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO 
TELL CHARGE THAT THE VATICAN HAS BEEN RAISING THE IDEA OF 
AN \"INTERNATIONAL FORCE\".  LAMDAN SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT 
RESPONDED VERY \"COLDLY\" TO THE IDEA.  HE ALSO TOLD CHARGE 
THAT THE VATICAN TOLD HIM IT WOULD SEND A \"SPECIAL ENVOY\" 
TO ISRAEL AND THE TERRITORIES.  AMBASSADOR LAMDAN SAID THAT 
AT FIRST, JERUSALEM SAID IT WOULDN\'T RECEIVE HIM, BUT IS 
NOW RECONSIDERING. 
 
4.  (C) POLOFF SUBSEQUENTLY MET WITH VATICAN MIDDLE EAST 
DIRECTOR GIOVANNI D\'ANIELLO MAY 24 TO SHARE REFTEL POINTS 
ON US REENGAGEMENT IN THE MEPP AND TO PASS HIM A COPY OF 
SUMMARY OF MITCHELL REPORT TAKEN FROM INTERNET.  D\'ANIELLO 
THANKED US FOR THE PAPER (NOTE: DESPITE THEIR FOCUS ON THE 
NEW MILLENNIUM, THE CURIA IS NOT YET FULLY WIRED). 
D\'ANIELLO, INVOKING THE POPE\'S SUNDAY HOMILY, SAID IT IS 
MOST IMPORTANT NOW FOR THE ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN LEADERS 
TO HAVE THE POLITICAL COURAGE TO STOP THE VIOLENCE.  FROM 
THAT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS POSSIBLE.  D\'ANIELLO NOTED THE 
EXISTENCE OF A NUMBER OF PLANS AND INTERNATIONAL 
INSTRUMENTS FOR PROGRAMMING CONFIDENCE BUILDING -- BUT CAME 
BACK TO THE NEED FOR THE VIOLENCE TO STOP FIRST.  IF REAL 
PROGRESS IS NOT SHOWN NOW, HE FEARED THAT PEOPLE, BOTH IN 
THE REGION AND INTERNATIONALLY, WILL BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO 
THE VIOLENCE AND THE CONFLICT WOULD GRIND ON INDEFINITELY. 
HE DID UNDERSCORE THE VATICAN\'S POSITION THAT THE HOLY 
SITES IN JERUSALEM SHOULD COME UNDER INTERNATIONAL 
GUARANTEES, AND HE AVERRED THAT REACHING AN AGREEMENT TO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02867  251557Z 
THAT END WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS BUILDING CONFIDENCE. 
HE TOO SAID THAT THE VATICAN SUPPORTS THE DEPLOYMENT OF AN 
INTERNATIONAL FORCE TO ENSURE PEACE, BUT HE DIDN\'T SHARE 
WITH POLOFF ANY HINT OF A VATICAN SPECIAL ENVOY.

CARDINAL PIO LAGHI TO JERUSALEM MAY 30. THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY\'S MIDDLE EAST DESK OFFICER, MONSIGNOR GIOVANNI 
D\'ANIELLO, ACCOMPANIED LAGHI. IN AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT THE

3.   (SBU) TWO EASTERN RITE CARDINALS COMMENTED THAT THEIR 
CHURCHES SHOULD ACT AS MEDIATORS FOR ANY RAPPROCHEMENT WITH 
THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. VATICAN OFFICIAL CARDINAL IGNACE MOUSSA 
I DAOUD AND UKRAINE\'S CARDINAL LUBOMYR HUSAR OPINED THAT 
THEIR EASTERN RITE CATHOLIC CHURCHES COULD HELP THE ORTHODOX 
UNDERSTAND THE WEST AND VISA VERSA. (COMMENT: THE CANON LAW 
FOR EASTERN CHURCHES INSISTS ON THE PRIMACY OF PAPAL 
AUTHORITY IN ALL MATTERS OF DOCTRINE, DISCIPLINE AND 
GOVERNANCE. UNLESS ROME DOES AN ABOUT FACE, IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO IMAGINE THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES MOVING CLOSER TOWARDS 
RESOLVING THEIR MISTRUST OF REAL OR IMAGINED INTENTIONS OF 
ROMAN CATHOLICISM. DAOUD AND HUSAR\'S OPTIMISM MAY HAVE BEEN 
MORE A PR EXERCISE AHEAD OF THE PAPAL VISIT TO UKRAINE THAN 
AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REAL STATE OF RELATIONS WITH THE 
ORTHODOX. END COMMENT).

NUTRITION AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHT

4.   (U) THE VATICAN DELEGATE AT A UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 
ORGANIZATION MEETING HAS ARGUED THAT \"THE RIGHT TO NUTRITION

PAGE 04        VATICA  02955  01 OF 02  012330Z 
IS FULLY AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHT.\" ARCHBISHOP AGOSTINO 
MARCHETTO, PERMANENT OBSERVER TO FAO, WENT ON TO SAY THAT 
THE LACK OF SECURE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FOOD IS ONE OF THE 
MOST SEVERE LIMITATIONS ON HUMAN FREEDOM AND THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF COMMUNITIES. THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT THE HOLY SEE IS 
\"PROFOUNDLY DISAPPOINTED\" BY LACK OF PROGRESS SINCE THE 1996 
WORLD FOOD SUMMIT. HE REGRETTED THAT WORLD LEADERS AND 
DEVELOPED NATIONS HAD NOT TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE 
FOOD SUPPLIES FOR NEEDY PEOPLE. DURING A TIME OF 
\"UNPRECEDENTED PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT,\" HE SAID, IT IS A 
SCANDAL THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE REMAIN HUNGRY. HE REMINDED 
MEETING PARTICIPANTS OF THE CORE OBLIGATIONS IN REGARD TO 
FOOD SECURITY - TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL 
FOOD WHICH IS NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE AND SAFE, TO ENSURE 
FREEDOM FROM HUNGER FOR EVERYONE.

5.   (U) VATICAN FM JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN DEFENDED THE JUNE 23- 
27 PAPAL VISIT TO UKRAINE AS A \"PILGRIMAGE\" THAT SHOULD NOT 
ALARM THEN RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. IN A PRESS CONFERENCE 
MARKING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA, ARCHBISHOP TAURAN SAID THAT THE 
80 MILLION MEMBERS OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN THAT COUNTRY 
SHOULD NOT FEEL THREATENED BY A MERE 50,000 CATHOLICS. 
TAURAN SAID THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA WAS NOT IN THE 
BUSINESS OF PROSELYTISM OR PROPAGANDA. (NOTE: RUSSIAN 
POLITICIANS AND ORTHODOX CHURCH LEADERS ARE SPEAKING OUT 
WITH INCREASING REGULARITY AGAINST THE PAPAL VISIT TO 
NEIGHBORING UKRAINE. OPPONENTS SUSPECT THE UKRAINE TRIP IS A 
VATICAN PLAN TO EXPAND CATHOLIC INFLUENCE IN TERRITORY WHICH 
THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH CONSIDERS ITS EXCLUSIVE DOMAIN. 
END NOTE). TAURAN TRIED TO ALLAY THE FEARS, DESCRIBING THE 
VISITS AS \"A RELIGIOUS EVENT AND A PILGRIMAGE.\" HE SAID IT 
IS EXACTLY WHAT THE POPE WOULD LIKE TO DO IN RUSSIA. 
HOWEVER, THE MOSCOW PATRIARCHATE HAS ALREADY DECLARED THAT 
RELATIONS WITH ROME WILL WORSEN IF THE POPE MEETS WITH 
UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX LEADERS WHOM THE PATRIARCHATE CONSIDERS 
TO BE IN SCHISM. SOME OF THOSE LEADERS BELONG TO UKRAINE\'S 
COUNCIL OF CHURCHES AND ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN 
ECUMENICAL MEETING WITH JOHN PAUL II.

6.   (U) POPE JOHN PAUL II WANTS SOCIAL JUSTICE AND THE 
RESOLUTION OF THE \"EXECRABLE CRIMES\" OF THE PAST IN 
GUATEMALA. HE WAS SPEAKING TO A GROUP OF GUATEMALAN BISHOP 
MAKING THEIR FIVE YEARLY BRIEFING VISIT TO VATICAN CITY. THE 
POPE SAID GUATEMALA \"HAS WITNESSED THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD OF 
TOO MANY CHILDREN.\" HE ADDED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO REVIVE THE 
MEMORY OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE COUNTRY\'S CIVIL 
WAR. IN HIS RESPONSE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUATEMALAN 
BISHOPS CONFERENCE, ARCHBISHOP VICTOR HUGO MARTINEZ 
CONTERARAS OF LOS ALTOS QUETZALTENANGO-TOTONICAPAN, SAID HIS 
COUNTRY\'S SOCIETY WAS TROUBLED BY \"VIOLENCE, ORGANIZED 
CRIME, DRUG TRAFFIC AND CORRUPTION.\" AFTER 36 YEARS OF CIVIL 
WAR, HE ADDED, \"THE PEOPLE OF GUATEMALA HAVE LOST ALL 
CONFIDENCE IN POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT.\" HE SAID THAT IN ORDER 
TO REGAIN THE PEOPLE\'S CONFIDENCE THE GOVERNMENT MUST CALL 
TO ACCOUNT THE PERPETRATORS OF CRIMINAL VIOLENCE AND 
SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE MURDER OF BISHOP JUAN GERARDI.

7.   (U) THE VATICAN ANNOUNCED MAY 31 THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II 
WILL TRAVEL TO ARMENIA AND KAZAKHSTAN IN SEPTEMBER, HIS 
FIRST TRIP TO EITHER COUNTRY. THE VISIT TO ARMENIA HAS BEEN 
LONG EXPECTED AND WILL FEATURE THE POPE\'S PRESENCE AT EVENTS 
MARKING 1700 YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE COUNTRY. THE 
VATICAN ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH KAZAKHSTAN IN 
1992. THE POPE IS EXPECTED TO SPEND TWO DAYS IN EACH 
COUNTRY, WITH APPEARANCE LIMITED TO THE CAPITAL CITIES. POPE 
JOHN PAUL ALSO PLANS TO VISIT BULGARIA IN THE SPRING OF

ARCHDIOCESE IS PLANNING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THE G8 SUMMIT IN GENOA TO PROMOTE THE VATICAN\'S 
VISION OF A GLOBALIZATION THAT LEAVES NO 
INDIVIDUAL BEHIND.  THE CARDINAL HAS INITIATED 
A SERIES OF PRE-G8 CONFERENCES TO REFLECT ON 
CHRISTIAN HUMANISM AND THE ECONOMY IN THE FACE 
OF GLOBALIZATION. THE LATEST OF THESE 
CONFERENCES, ATTENDED BY OVER 1000 PEOPLE, WAS 
SPONSORED BY A CATHOLIC NGO (NEW HUMANITY) AND 
WAS SUPPORTED BY ARCHDIOCESE OF GENOA.   THE 
WEEKEND CONFERENCE DEVELOPED A PLAN TO PRESENT 
TO G8 SUMMITEERS A \"GENOA DOCUMENT\" INTENDED TO 
PROMOTE \"AN ECONOMY OF COMMUNION\" (I.E. AN 
ECONOMY WHICH VALUES THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL

\"SEATTLE GROUP\") IS NOT AGAINST GLOBALIZATION 
PER SE, WHICH IT VIEWS AS AN HISTORICAL 
INEVITABILITY.  VATICAN AND CHURCH RELATED NGOS 
WILL SEEK TO CONFRONT IN GENOA ONLY THE 
NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF GLOBALIZATION.  DURING THE 
G8 TETTAMANZI WILL FOCUS PROTEST ON AREAS WHERE 
GLOBALIZATION RESULTS IN BASIC INJUSTICES (SUCH 
AS INCREASING POVERTY) WHICH HE ASSERTS ARE

1. (C)  POPE JOHN PAUL II DISPATCHED PIO CARDINAL LAGHI TO 
MEET ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER SHARON AND PALESTINIAN 
AUTHORITY CHAIRMAN ARAFAT ON JUNE 2.  VATICAN MIDDLE EAST 
DIRECTOR MONS. GIOVANNI D\'ANIELLO ACCOMPANIED LAGHI. 
CHARGE CALLED ON D\'ANIELLO JUNE 6 FOR READ-OUT OF TRIP. 
D\'ANIELLO SAID THAT SOLE PURPOSE OF THE TRIP WAS TO EXPRESS 
THE POPE\'S DESIRE THAT THE VIOLENCE STOP.  D\'ANIELLO SAID 
THAT THE VATICAN DID NOT PROPOSE ANY NEW POLITICAL 
SOLUTIONS TO THE ARAB/ISRAELI CONFLICT, AND DID NOT RAISE 
ITS DESIRE TO SEE AN INTERNATIONAL FORCE DISPATCHED TO 
ISRAEL AND THE TERRITORIES.  CHARGE ASKED ABOUT LAGHI\'S 
STATEMENTS WHICH ISRAELI CONTACTS INTERPRET AS JUDGING 
SETTLEMENT EXPANSION AS THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF THE SUICIDE 
BOMBINGS.  D\'ANIELLO  SAID THAT LAGHI\'S INTENT WAS TO SAY 
THAT BOTH THE VIOLENCE, AND THE \"PROVOCATION\" TO VIOLENCE, 
MUST END.  D\'ANIELLO ADDED VERY LITTLE INSIGHT TO THE 
VISIT, BUT DID SAY THAT THE VATICAN HAD NO PLANS TO 
UNDERTAKE A SECOND MISSION. 
 
2. (C)  IN A FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATION, ISRAEL EMBASSY DCM ZVI 
TAL GAVE A/DCM AN EARFUL OF HIS EMBASSY\'S VIEWS ON THE 
DETERIORATION OF RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE.  RECITING A 
NUMBER OF SLIGHTS DATING BACK TO NOVEMBER 2000, TAL SAID A 
PATTERN HAS EMERGED OF THE VATICAN BACKING OFF FROM ITS 
PREVIOUS COMMITMENT TO CATHOLIC-JEWISH DIALOGUE.  BEGINNING 
WITH THE VATICAN\'S REFUSAL TO COORDINATE WITH THE ISRAEL 
EMBASSY A COMMEMORATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE PONTIFF\'S 
HISTORIC VISIT TO THE HOLY LANDS, THROUGH A SERIES OF MINOR 
SLIGHTS (LIKE NOT RECEIVING VISITING KNESSET MEMBERS) TO 
THE QLACK OF BALANCEQ IN LAGHI\'S PUBLIC COMMENTARY THIS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03118  111552Z 
WEEK, TAL ASSERTED THAT THE VATICAN HAS BEEN CLOSING DOORS 
ON DIALOGUE WITH THE GOI.  TAL SHARED WITH A/DCM A COPY OF 
THE POPE\'S LETTER TO PM SHARON (FAXED TO EUR/WE), NOTING 
THAT EVEN THAT MISSIVE CONTAINED THE QCODE WORD JUSTICEQ, 
TO REFER TO A PERCEIVED VATICAN TILT TOWARDS THE 
PALESTINIANS.  THE ISRAEL EMBASSY IS NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH 
THE STATE OF RELATIONS, AND IF FEARFUL THAT THINGS COULD 
GET WORSE.  TAL SAID HIS SOURCES INDICATE SECRETARY OF 
STATE CARDINAL SODANO IS THE FORCE BEHIND THESE 
DEVELOPMENTS.  (NOTE: SODANO IS PM EQUIVALENT AND REGARDED 
BY SOME AS A POSSIBLE PAPAL SUCCESSOR). 
 
3. (C)  COMMENT:  POST TOO HAS NOTED THAT THE VATICAN\'S 
TILT TOWARD THE PALESTINIANS HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT MORE 
EVIDENT.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR 
THIS.  WE BELIEVE IT REFLECTS IN LARGE PART THE VATICAN\'S 
UNDERSTANDABLE NEED TO MIND THE INTERESTS OF CHRISTIANS IN 
THE HOLY LANDS.  IT MAY ALSO REFLECT A VATICAN POLICY TO 
SUPPORT ARAFAT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE EVIL YOU KNOW IS 
BETTER THAN THE EVIL YOU DON\'T.  IT MAY REFLECT RESIDUAL 
ANTI-SEMITIC ATTITUDES THAT STILL EXIST AMONG SOME WITHIN 
THE VATICAN.  IT ALSO MAY REFLECT SODANO\'S OWN POLITICAL 
MANEUVERING TOWARDS GREATER INFLUENCE, PERHAPS EVEN THE 
PAPACY, IN THE WANING DAYS OF JP II\'S PONTIFICATE.

POSSIBLE VISIT BY PRESIDENT BUSH TO THE VATICAN. 
 
2.  (U)  BEGIN TEXT.  THE VATICAN IS VIGOROUS AND ACTIVE 
IN THE GLOBAL PURSUIT OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY, HUMAN 
DEVELOPMENT, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  WHILE THE 
VATICAN ASSERTS PUBLICLY THAT A FUNDAMENTAL TENET OF ITS 
FOREIGN POLICY IS DEFENSE OF THE HUMAN PERSON (LARGELY 
CONGRUENT WITH THE US SUPPORT FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION, 
DEMOCRATIZATION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS), IN REALITY IT 
FREQUENTLY ACTS JUST LIKE A NATION-STATE IN PURSUING ITS 
OWN PERCEIVED SELF-INTEREST. THE VATICAN IS THUS ACTIVE 
ACROSS AN OUTSIZED NUMBER OF CRISIS AREAS IN EFFORTS TO 
RESOLVE CONFLICT AND PROMOTE RECONCILIATION AND 
DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, AND TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF 
CATHOLICS. IN THE BALKANS, THE VATICAN SEEKS TO PROMOTE 
PEACE AND RECONCILIATION FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS, TO 
PROTECT \"CATHOLIC\" PEOPLE AND INTERESTS, AND TO REINFORCE 
ITS OUTREACH TO THE ORTHODOX WORLD.  A KEY GOAL OF POPE 
JOHN PAUL II IS TO HEAL THE THOUSAND-YEAR SCHISM BETWEEN 
CATHOLICS AND ORTHODOX, IN ORDER TO CREATE A CONTINENT, 
FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS, AT PEACE WITH ITSELF AND 
REINFORCED WITH THE UNIFIED SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION OF 
CHRISTIANITY. 
 
3. (SBU)  THE USG HAS ENGAGED THE VATICAN TO PROMOTE 
CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN THE BALKANS.  DURING THE NATO AIR 
CAMPAIGN IN KOSOVO, WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE VATICAN TO 
HEAD OFF ITS  CRITICISM OF THE MILITARY ACTION (A PAPAL 
DENUNCIATION OF THE CAMPAIGN AS AN \"UNJUST WAR\" WOULD 
HAVE MADE ALLIANCE SOLIDARITY THAT MUCH HARDER TO 
SUSTAIN). MORE RECENTLY, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

VATICAN TO EXERCISE A MODERATING INFLUENCE ON CROAT- 
NATIONALIST CLERGY IN HERZEGOVINA.  WE HAVE ALSO PROMOTED 
INTER-COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION BY DEVELOPING AND 
IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS IN KOSOVO AND BOSNIA IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH VATICAN-AFFILIATED NGO, THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY. 
WITH THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF EMBASSY VATICAN, 
SANT\'EGIDIO HOSTED A SUCCESSFUL INTER-RELIGIOUS 
CONFERENCE WITH THE KEY BOSNIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS JUNE 8, 
2001.  THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT\'S PD/ECA OFFICE.

SUBJECT: BACKGROUND PAPER FOR PRESIDENTIAL VISIT: IRAQ 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY CDA JOSEPH MERANTE, REASONS E.O. 12958 
1.5 (B), (D). 
 
1. (C) BEGIN TEXT.  THE VATICAN CONDEMNED THE WEST\'S 
PROSECUTION OF THE GULF WAR, AND IT HAS CONSISTENTLY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  03121  111605Z 
OPPOSED U.S. SANCTIONS POLICY TOWARD IRAQ.  WE SHOULD 
EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO.  MANY FACTORS ARE 
INVOLVED IN THE VATICAN\'S TOLERATION OF THE IRAQI 
REGIME.  THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE: 
 
-- RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES/HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS: THE 
VATICAN SEEKS TO TRANSLATE ITS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, AS 
WELL AS ITS SINCERE HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS, INTO 
CONCRETE POLICY. ITS NON-CONFRONTATIONAL POLICY TOWARD 
IRAQ IS PARTIALLY BASED ON ITS CONVICTION THAT THE 
ECONOMIC EMBARGO IS SEVERELY IMPACTING THE PEOPLE OF 
IRAQ.  TO COUNTER THIS BELIEF, CREDIBLE ARGUMENTS MUST 
BE MADE THAT THE EMBARGO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
HARDSHIP BEING EXPERIENCED BY THE IRAQI PEOPLE; 
 
-- NATIONAL SELF-INTEREST: THE VATICAN LABORS TO 
PROTECT CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD.  ITS CONSISTENT 
SUPPORT OF SADDAM HUSSEIN PARTIALLY RESULTS FROM ITS 
DESIRE TO PROTECT THE 600,000 IRAQI CATHOLICS FROM 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM.  THE VATICAN HAS CONSISTENTLY 
TOLD US THAT, IN ITS VIEW, THE STATE OF RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM IN IRAQ IS BETTER THAN IN MANY OTHER ARAB 
COUNTRIES.  IN THE VATICAN\'S VIEW, THE LIKELY 
ALTERNATIVE TO SADDAM WOULD BE AN ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT. 
FOR THE VATICAN, A SECULAR DICTATORSHIP IS MUCH 
PREFERABLE TO AN ISLAMIC ONE. (NOTE: 600,00 IRAQI\'S 
BELONG TO THE CHALDEAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.  THIS CHURCH 
IS IN FULL COMMUNION WITH ROME, ALTHOUGH IT RETAINS 
RITES, TRADITIONS, AND DISCIPLINE WHICH ARE 
SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ROMAN CATHOLICISM). 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03121  111605Z 
--RELIGIOUS MANEUVERING: THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IS 
CLOSE TO SIGNING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH 
OF THE EAST ON REUNIFICATION WITH ROME.  (NOTE: THE 
ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST IS AN ANCIENT CHURCH WHICH 
BROKE WITH THE REST OF WORLD CHRISTENDOM IN THE 4TH 
CENTURY).  THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST IS CENTERED 
IN IRAQ, AND AS A CHRISTIAN DENOMINATION PREFERS 
SADDAM HUSSEIN TO AN ISLAMICIST LEADER.  THE VATICAN 
IS VERY SENSITIVE AT THIS POINT TO AVOID TAKING 
POSITIONS WHICH WOULD ALIENATE THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH. 
 
-- PERSONAL DESIRES OF JOHN PAUL II: THERE ARE THREE 
MAJOR TRIPS WHICH THE POPE HAS EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO 
COMPLETE BEFORE HIS HEALTH FURTHER DETERIORATES-- 
RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAQ.  PLANS FOR THE POPE TO VISIT THE 
SITE OF ABRAHAM\'S BIRTH IN UR (IRAQ) WERE CALLED OFF 
IN 2000.  THE POPE STILL HARBORS A DESIRE TO PRAY AT 
THIS SITE.  THIS PAPAL DESIRE IS ANOTHER REASON WHY 
THE VATICAN WISHES TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH 
IRAQ. 
 
2.  (C)  CONCLUSION:  UNLESS SADDAM\'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
ABUSES INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY, AND DIRECTLY IMPACT THE 
IRAQI CATHOLIC COMMUNITY, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE 
VATICAN WILL CHANGE ITS POSITION ON IRAQ.  IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO BRIEF THE VATICAN ON 
CONTINUED IRAQI ABUSES, AND TO PROVIDE CREDIBLE 
EVIDENCE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S MALEVOLENT INTENT AGAINST 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.

AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY HAS INDICATED INTEREST IN SUPPORTING THE 
PROJECT AND WE WILL FOLLOW UP ON THIS WITH THEM.  THE 
REPARATION SERVANT SISTERS OF MARY HAVE WORKED FOR TEN YEARS 
IN ALBANIA WITH AT RISK WOMEN AND ARE FULLY VERSED IN 
ALBANIAN SOCIAL DYNAMICS. THEY SEEK USG FUNDING TO CREATE A 
PROJECT IN ADDITION TO THEIR CURRENT WORK THAT WILL FOCUS ON 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING EDUCATION AND COUNSELING FOR POTENTIAL

3.   STAFF AND TRAINING: THE 20 MEMBER TEAM INCLUDES THE 
SISTERS AND IS COMPOSED OF 12 TEACHERS, 5 SOCIAL WORKERS, A 
DOCTOR, 2 NURSES, PLUS A NUMBER OF ACTIVITY COORDINATORS. 
FURTHER TRAINING WILL GIVE THEM WOMEN\'S DEVELOPMENT SKILLS, 
INCLUDING SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY, THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF 
PROSTITUTION, AND INTERVENTION SKILLS. TRAINING WILL BE 
PROVIDED BY EXPERTS BASED IN TIRANA (FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE 
WORKING WITH THE IOM) OR ABROAD AND LAST APPROXIMATELY 30 
DAYS. INITIAL TRAINING WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A WEEKLONG 
INTENSIVE COURSE FOCUSED ON ANTI-TRAFFICKING COUNSELING 
SKILLS AND STRATEGIES. ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION OF 
INDIVIDUAL SKILLS WILL TAKE PLACE EVERY 40 DAYS. SALARIES 
ARE BASED ON ALBANIAN SCALES AND REFLECT EMPLOYMENT OF 
LOCALLY HIRED PART-TIME STAFF. THE NUNS RECEIVE A MINIMAL 
STIPEND, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL SALARY COSTS. ALL 
STAFF INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT SPEAK ALBANIAN. 
 
4.   PREVENTION MODULE EDUCATION: IN ADDITION TO COUNSELING, 
EDUCATION FOR PREVENTION IS A PRIORITY AT THIS STAGE OF 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING EFFORTS. THE SISTERS WILL CAPITALIZE ON 
THEIR EXISTING CONTACTS WITH 3500 PLUS YOUNG PEOPLE. IN 
VLORA, THE SISTERS HAVE ACCESS TO 7 JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH 
SCHOOLS. THEY ALSO HAVE CONTACTS IN A NEWLY ESTABLISHED 
OUTER SUBURB (FUSCH AVIACIONE) HOUSING POOR FAMILIES NEWLY 
ARRIVED FROM SOUTHERN ALBANIA AND THE MOUNTAIN REGION, WHO 
MOVED TO VLORA IN SEARCH OF WORK. THE SISTERS ARE WORKING 
WITH MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES TO ESTABLISH SCHOOLS AND BASIC 
SERVICES. THEY HAVE SET UP A SMALL EDUCATION CENTER TO SERVE 
A LARGE GROUP OF GIRLS WHO HAVE NO SOCIAL LIFE AND LITTLE 
EDUCATION, AND THUS PERFECT TARGETS FOR TRAFFICKERS.

AS OUTLINED IN THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS. 
THE COURSES WILL PRESENT INFORMATION, HELP THE STUDENTS 
ASSIMILATE IT AND ASSIST THEM IN APPLYING CONCEPTS TO THEIR 
EVERYDAY SITUATIONS. THE PROJECT WILL SEEK THE PROFESSIONAL 
ASSISTANCE OF PEOPLE 
 ALREADY WORKING IN THE ANTI-TRAFFICKING 
FIELD (E.G. VERA LESKO, DIRECTOR OF THE ANTI-TRAFFICKING NGO 
\"VATRA\"). THE SISTERS RECOGNIZE THAT MESSAGES AND 
INFORMATION MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITIES OF ALBANIAN LIFE. 
THE SISTERS WILL USE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE \"CULTURAL 
CODES\" AND THE SOCIOLOGY OF THE ALBANIAN FAMILY TO TAILOR AN 
APPROPRIATE PROGRAM INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGICAL, MORAL AND 
SOCIOLOGICAL STRATEGIES. 
 
6.   EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL WILL BE PURCHASED OR PRINTED. THIS 
INCLUDES FLYERS AND POSTERS, BOOKS, AND ARTICLES.  THE 
LATTER TO MAKE UP A SMALL NEWSPAPER TO LAUNCH A NETWORK OF

--------------------------------------------- 
THE VATICAN AND THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  THE VATICAN\'S POSITION ON THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
PROCESS HAS EVOLVED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST THREE 
YEARS.  FOR MANY YEARS, THE VATICAN CALLED FOR THE 
\"INTERNATIONALIZATION\" OF JERUSALEM, BUT IN THE LATE \'90\'S 
THE POSITION CHANGED TO THE \"INTERNATIONALIZATION\" OF 
JERUSALEM \"INTRAMURA\" (WITHIN THE WALLS).  MOST RECENTLY, 
ON THE ISSUE OF JERUSALEM THE VATICAN MOVED SUBSTANTIALLY 
IN A DIRECTION WHICH CAN BE SEEN AS CONSTRUCTIVE.  IT HAS 
DROPPED THE CALL FOR INTERNATIONALIZING ANY PART OF 
JERUSALEM AND IS NOW ASKING THAT THE SHRINES OF THE THREE 
RELIGIONS PRESERVE THEIR UNIQUE AND SACRED CHARACTER 
THROUGH \"INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES\", IN SUCH A WAY THAT IN 
THE FUTURE \"NONE OF THE PARTIES WILL BE ABLE TO CLAIM FOR 
ITSELF EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF THESE SACRED PARTS OF THE 
CITY\".  SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE CITY WOULD BE A MATTER FOR THE 
ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS TO NEGOTIATE. 
 
3.  (C)  DESPITE A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE STAND ON THE FUTURE OF 
JERUSALEM, THE VATICAN\'S TILT TOWARD THE PALESTINIAN SIDE 
OF THE CONFLICT HAS BEEN MORE EVIDENT IN THE WAKE OF THE 
MOST RECENT VIOLENCE.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE 
EXPLANATIONS TO THE INCREASE IN OVERT SYMPATHY FOR THE 
PALESTINIAN CAUSE.  IT REFLECTS IN LARGE PART THE VATICAN\'S 
NEED TO MIND THE INTERESTS OF THE PALESTINIAN CHRISTIANS. 
ONE OF THE VATICAN\'S WORST FEARS IS A JERUSALEM DEVOID OF 
CHRISTIANS.  THE VATICAN HAS BEEN ALSO TELLING EMBASSY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03149  121501Z 
VATICAN THAT IT BELIEVES IT NEEDS TO SHORE UP YASSIR 
ARAFAT, AS IT IS CONCERNED WITH WHAT DIRECTION THE 
PALESTINIAN MOVEMENT WILL TAKE AFTER ARAFAT LEAVES THE 
SCENE (I.E. ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM).  THE PERCEIVED TILT 
MAY ALSO REFLECT RESIDUAL ANTI-SEMITIC ATTITUDES THAT STILL 
EXIST AMONG SOME WITHIN THE VATICAN.  FINALLY, IT COULD 
ALSO BE THE RESULT OF POLITICAL MANEUVERING BY PRIME 
MINISTER SODANO AS HE ORGANIZES HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE 
PAPACY.  A PRO-PALESTINIAN STANCE IS POPULAR AMONG 
CARDINALS FROM THE THIRD WORLD.

MAINLAND CHINA IS ITS RIGHT TO MINISTER TO THE 
ESTIMATED 10 MILLION CATHOLIC POPULATION.  THE 
VATICAN AND THE PRC DO NOT HAVE OFFICIAL 
RELATIONS.  THE PRC REPUDIATES VATICAN CLAIMS TO 
LEAD CHINESE CATHOLICS AND INTERPRETS VATICAN 
ECCLESIASTIC ACTIONS AS FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN 
SOVEREIGN AFFAIRS.  THE PRC OVERSEES THE OFFICIAL 
\"CATHOLIC PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION,\" SET UP IN 1951 
TO HARMONIZE RELIGIOUS PRACTICE WITH STATE 
AUTHORITIES.  AN UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC COMMUNITY 
REMAINS LOYAL TO VATICAN LEADERSHIP. 
 
-------------------------------- 
TAIWAN, THE VATICAN, AND THE PRC 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.   (C) THE VATICAN MAINTAINS OFFICIAL STATE-TO- 
STATE RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN (THE REPUBLIC OF 
CHINA), HAVING TRANSFERRED ITS EMBASSY (KNOWN AS 
A \"NUNCIATURE\") FROM BEIJING TO TAIPEI IN THE 
WAKE OF THE REVOLUTION.  TAIWAN IN TURN MAINTAINS 
AN EMBASSY TO THE VATICAN, PROVIDING THE ISLAND 
NATION WITH A PRECIOUS EUROPEAN PLATFORM FROM 
WHICH TO PURSUE A VIGOROUS DIPLOMATIC AGENDA. 
THE VATICAN CONTINUES TO SIGNAL ITS READINESS TO 
DOWNGRADE ITS TAIPEI MISSION AND ESTABLISH 
OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH THE PRC.  THE VATICAN 
AFFIRMS THAT THE MOTHBALLING OF ITS ORIGINAL 
BEIJING NUNCIATURE WAS NEVER DEFINITIVE, ADDING 
THAT IT HAS CONSISTENTLY PRACTICED A ONE-CHINA- 
POLICY.  THE VATICAN HAS A LOW-KEY PRESENCE IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

HONG KONG, AN OFFICE THAT IS A VESTIGE OF THE 
HAND-OVER; IT CLAIMS TO BE POISED TO REOPEN IN 
BEIJING QUOTE OVERNIGHT ENDQUOTE, A CLAIM THAT IS 
LARGELY RHETORICAL.  TAIWAN\'S REPRESENTATIVES TO 
THE VATICAN ARE SANGUINE AT THIS PROSPECT OF A 
DIPLOMATIC SEA CHANGE, YET THE TAIWAN EMBASSY IS 
QUIETLY EXPLORING OTHER WAYS TO PRESERVE A 
DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN ROME, FOR INSTANCE, 
THROUGH ACCREDITATION TO THE SOVEREIGN MILITARY 
ORDER OF MALTA, LOCATED IN ROME AND FORMALLY 
RECOGNIZED BY 85 GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING ITALY. 
 
3.  (C) VATICAN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRC REMAIN 
UNOFFICIAL, IRREGULAR, AND OFTEN VITUPERATIVE. 
THE STICKING POINT IS PRC UNWILLINGNESS TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE VATICAN JURISDICTION OVER THE CHINESE 
CATHOLIC COMMUNITY, INCLUDING VATICAN OVERSIGHT 
OF THE TRAINING OF CLERGY AND THE APPOINTMENT OF 
NEW BISHOPS.  THE PRC TREATS VATICAN CLAIMS TO 
ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY IN CHINA AS TANTAMOUNT 
TO FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL SOVEREIGN 
AFFAIRS.  WHILE THE PRC PERMITS OCCASIONAL CHURCH 
VISITS BY VATICAN ENVOYS, INCLUDING AT THE 
CARDINAL LEVEL, AND ALLOWS LIMITED TRAINING 
ABROAD FOR \"PATRIOTIC\" SEMINARIANS, THE RUMORS OF 
AN EMERGING DIPLOMATIC RAPPROCHEMENT HAVE BEEN 
GREATLY OVERSTATED, WITH THE VATICAN-PRC 
RELATIONSHIP INCREASINGLY STRAINED.  IN JANUARY 
2000 THE PRC CROSSED A RUBICON OF SORTS WHEN THE 
STATE-SPONSORED \"CATHOLIC PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION\" 
ORDAINED FIVE BISHOPS IN DEFIANCE OF A VATICAN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

BAN.  CONVERSELY, THE MASS BEATIFICATION OF 120 
CHINESE MARTYRS AT THE VATICAN ON OCTOBER 1, 
2000, A PRC NATIONAL HOLIDAY IN CELEBRATION OF 
THE REVOLUTION, WAS A PROVOCATION, WITH THE PRC 
LAMBASTING THE MARTYRS AS CRIMINAL ELEMENTS AND 
IMPERIALIST BLACKGUARDS.  THE PRC WAS DEAF TO 
VATICAN PROTESTS THAT THE CHOICE OF DATE WAS 
SHEER COINCIDENCE.

4.   (C) IN 1951 THE PRC ESTABLISHED AN OFFICIAL 
\"CATHOLIC PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION\" TO MINISTER TO 
THE COUNTRY\'S CATHOLI

PRACTICE OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF THE PATRIOTIC 
ASSOCIATION IS TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL, YET HAS

CLERGY REMAIN IN DETENTION, WITH THE VATICAN 
OSTENSIBLY UNABLE TO DETERMINE THEIR WELFARE AND

COMMENTARY ON THE PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION AND THERE 
ARE INDICATIONS THAT THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE 
PATRIOTIC AND UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IS 
BLURRING.  ACCORDING TO VATICAN SOURCES AND FIELD 
REPORTING, A NUMBER OF CLERGY IN THE PATRIOTIC 
CHURCH ARE IN TRUTH LOYAL TO THE VATICAN. 
SIMILARLY, THE VATICAN WELCOMES VISITS BY 
PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION SEMINARIANS AS A CHANCE TO 
SHAPE, EVEN IF INDIRECTLY, THEIR THEOLOGICAL 
FORMATION.

BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (U) THIS CABLE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND 
INFORMATION FOR THE PLANNED PRESIDENTIAL MEETING WITH THE 
POPE.  IT UPDATES REFTEL, OUTLINING ASPECTS OF THE USG- 
HOLY SEE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE BELIEVE WILL REQUIRE U.S. 
ATTENTION IN THE NEAR AND MIDTERM. THE MIDDLE EAST WILL 
FEATURE PROMINENTLY.  IN ASIA, VATICAN PRIORITIES WILL 
REMAIN FOCUSED ON CHINA, TAIWAN, VIETNAM AND 
INDONESIA/EAST TIMOR. THE VATICAN IS INVOLVED IN 
MEDIATING AFRICA\'S GREAT LAKES CONFLICT, WHILE CUBA LOOMS 
LARGE AMONG VATICAN INTERESTS IN LATIN AMERICA.  THIS 
CABLE IDENTIFIES AREAS IN WHICH THE U.S. AND THE VATICAN 
SHARE INTERESTS, AND AREAS IN WHICH THERE ARE POLICY 
DIFFERENCES. 
 
3. (U) BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION (CONT\'D): THE HOLY SEE 
IS A SUPRANATIONAL ENTITY THAT HAS ITS CAPITAL AND 
TERRITORIAL MANIFESTATION IN THE STATE OF VATICAN CITY. 
THE UNITED STATES BASED ITS 1984 RECOGNITION OF THE HOLY 
SEE IN PART ON THE FACT THAT THE HOLY SEE EXERCISES 
SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE 109 ACRES OF THE VATICAN CITY STATE. 
HOWEER ALL AMBASSADORS TO THE HOLY SEE, INCLUDING THE 
U.S. AMBASSADOR, ARE ACCREDITED TO THE HOLY SEE AN 
NOT/NOT TO THE STATE OF VATICAN CITY.  THE VATIAN 
INSISTS ON THIS POINT TO REMIND THAT ITS REAC AND 
INTERNATIONAL PERSONALITY IS GLOBAL.  FOR PRPOSES OF 
THIS CABLE, THE TERMS HOLY SEE AND VATICAN WILL BE USED 
INTERCHANGEABLY.

PAGE 03        VATICA  03507  01 OF 04  031719Z 
 
4. (U) BACKGOUND AND INTRODUCTION (CONT\'D):  THE HOLY 
SEE ISONE OF THE OLDEST CONTINUALLY EXISTING 
INTERNATINAL ENTITIES. IT EXERCISED TEMPORAL CONTROL OF 
TE ITAIAN PENINSULA DURING THE MIDDLE AGES, BUT WAS 
COMPLETELY BEREFT OF TERRITORY BETWEEN 1870 AND 1929. 
NEVERTHELESS, EVEN DURING THIS PERIOD, MOST NATIONS 
CONTINUED TO RECOGNIZE THE IT AS AN INTERNATIONAL ENTITY 
AND MAINTAINED FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. 
 
5. (U) BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION (CONT\'D): THE VATICAN 
IS ONE OF VERY FEW SOVEREIGN ENTITIES THAT HAVE PRESENCE 
AND REACH IN VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTRY OF THE WORLD. 
ALTHOUGH ITS SOVEREIGNTY IS OVER LIMITED TERRITORY, 
VATICAN TEACHING AND POLICIES CAN INFLUENCE THE OVER ONE 
BILLION ADHERENTS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.  END 
BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
DEVELOPING POLICY TOWARD THE HOLY SEE 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) IN DEVELOPING U.S. POLICY VIS-A-VIS THIS UNIQUE 
ENTITY, POLICYMAKERS SHOULD THINK OF THE HOLY SEE AS 
SIMILAR TO A TRADITIONAL NATION-STATE, WITH A VARIETY OF 
FACTORS INFORMING ITS FOREIGN POLICY.  THE MOST IMPORTANT 
CONSIDERATIONS IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY DECISION MAKING 
INCLUDE: 
 
-- RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES/HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS: THE 
VATICAN STRIVES TO TRANSLATE ITS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND 
ITS HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS INTO CONCRETE POLICIES. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  03507  01 OF 04  031719Z 
FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES BASED ON THESE PRINCIPLES 
INCLUDE: SUPPORT FOR THIRD WORLD DEVELOPMENT AND DEBT 
RELIEF FOR POORER COUNTRIES, OPPOSITION TO CAPITAL 
PUNISHMENT, OPPOSITION TO ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION, AND 
OPPOSITION (ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS) TO EMBARGOES; 
 
-- \"NATIONAL\" SELF-INTEREST: THE HOLY SEE SEEKS TO 
PROTECT CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD, ITS OWN POSITION OF 
INFLUENCE, AND ITS VAST WEALTH.  THE VATICAN\'S SUPPORT OF 
SADDAM HUSSEIN RESULTS FROM ITS DESIRE TO PROTECT 600,000 
IRAQI CATHOLICS FROM ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM; ITS REFUSAL 
TO PUBLICLY CRITICIZE CROAT NATIONALIST CLERGY IN BOSNIA 
STEMS IN PART FROM THE CROAT CHURCH\'S STAUNCH DEFENSE OF 
THE FAITH DURING THE COLD WAR; 
 
-- HISTORY/TRADITION: RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND 
SPAIN, PORTUGAL, AND OTHER LATIN COUNTRIES GO BACK OVER 
500 YEARS.  THE VATICAN\'S HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH 
THESE COUNTRIES FREQUENTLY DEMANDS AN ACTIVE FOREIGN 
POLICY ROLE; 
 
-- PROSELYTISM: THE VATICAN KNOWS THAT IT MUST

SUBJECT:  THE VATICAN-- THE SUPRANATIONAL POWER 
 
CONTINUALLY REFRESH ITS MESSAGE FOR CHANGING TIMES. 
VATICAN II IN THE 1960S WAS AN EXAMPLE.  INTERFAITH AND

PAPACY, AND PROSELYTISM/POPULATION GROWTH IN THE THIRD

WORLD ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH IN 
RECENT YEARS. 
 
7. (C) PAPAL HEALTH/SUCCESSION AND WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR 
U.S. POLICY:  POPE JOHN PAUL II IS SURELY THE MOST WIDELY 
RECOGNIZED WORLD LEADER.  ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, HE ENJOYS THE HIGHEST STATURE AND PROFILE 
AMONG WORLD LEADERS. IN EARLY 2000, PRESS 
MISREPRESENTATION OF A GERMAN BISHOP\'S REMARKS IN THE 
POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE, 
SPARKED A SERIES OF SPECULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT 
SUCCESSION.  THE POPE AND THE VATICAN STRONGLY DENIED 
THAT HIS CONDITION WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO WARRANT 
ABDICATION.  THERE IS LITTLE SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA THAT 
THE POPE WOULD IN FACT RESIGN EVEN IF HIS HEALTH WERE TO 
DECLINE PRECIPITOUSLY.  THE LIST OF CARDINALS WIDELY 
PERCEIVED AS POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY 
AMERICANS, AND ONLY ONE ANGLOPHONE.  AN ELECTION OF A 
EUROPEAN CARDINAL (MOST LIKELY AN ITALIAN) WOULD PROBABLY 
RESULT IN ONLY MINOR CHANGES IN VATICAN POLICY AND ITS 
CURRENT STANCE ON ISSUES VIS A VIS THE UNITED STATES.  IF 
THE NEXT POPE IS FROM LATIN AMERICA, ASIA, OR AFRICA, WE 
SHOULD EXPECT THE VATICAN TO TAKE POSITIONS FURTHER TO 
THE \"LEFT OF CURRENT U.S. POSITIONS ON ECONOMIC ISSUES, 
BUT FURTHER \"RIGHT\" ON SOCIAL ISSUES. 
 
MIDDLE EAST

8. (C) MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS (MEPP):  THE HOLY SEE 
DENIES WANTING TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03507  02 OF 04  031715Z 
ASPECTS OF THE MEPP, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS KEENLY 
INTERESTED IN WHAT IT TERMS THE \"CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS\" 
ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SITES IN THE REGION (SPECIFICALLY 
JERUSALEM).  THE VATICAN MAINTAINS THAT ITS CONCERNS HAVE 
BEEN LARGELY IGNORED BY THE USG AND THE ISRAELIS, AND IN 
1999 WORKED WITH THE FRENCH AND SEVERAL OTHER EU 
COUNTRIES IN THE \"JERUSALEM WORKING GROUP\" (JWG -- SINCE 
INACTIVE). 
 
9. (C)  THE VATICAN WAS CLEARLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE USG 
AND GOI DECLINED TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE JWG INITIATIVE. 
THE GOI\'S DECISION TO ALLOW CONSTRUCTION OF THE NAZARETH 
MOSQUE CREATED ALARM (AND IN SOME CASES, RESENTMENT) AT 
THE VATICAN.  THE GOI FOR ITS PART WAS CONCERNED THAT THE 
POPE LEFT UNANSWERED BASHIR ASSAD\'S ANTI-SEMITIC 
INVECTIVE DURING THE POPE\'S MAY 2001 SYRIA VISIT.  WE CAN 
EXPECT CONTINUED TENSION IN THESE AREAS.  THE HOLY SEE 
WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE MEPP, WHILE 
DENYING THIS INTENTION.  EMBASSY VATICAN CONTINUES TO 
RECOMMEND A HIGH LEVEL VISIT TO ENCOURAGE THE VATICAN TO 
PLAY A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE, OR AT LEAST LESS UNHELPFUL, 
ROLE IN THE PROCESS. 
 
ASIA 
---- 
 
10. (C) THE VATICAN AND THE U.S. SHARE INTERESTS IN MANY 
OF THE SAME COUNTRIES (E.G. INDONESIA, CHINA, TAIWAN, 
VIETNAM), BUT NOT ALWAYS FOR THE SAME REASONS.  IN 
ADDITION TO THE FORMAL CHURCH NETWORK NUMEROUS, OFTEN

OPERATING THROUGHOUT ASIA HAVE A SOPHISTICATED 
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THEIR AREA. 
CONTACT WITH THESE MISSIONARY ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDES 
UNIQUE INSIGHTS INTO CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES. THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CATHOLIC FAITH IN ASIA IS AN EXPRESS 
GOAL OF THE CHURCH.  THE VATICAN AND ITS CONSTITUENT 
EPISCOPATES ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DIALOGUES WITH 
POLITICALLY POWERFUL MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN ORTHODOX 
FAITHS.  THE RESULTS OF THESE DIALOGUES WILL IMPACT 
PROSPECTS FOR DEMOCRACY, STABILITY, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND 
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES. 
 
11. (C) CHINA:  WITH ITS OWN NETWORK OF CONTACTS AMONG 
CHINA\'S UNDERGROUND AND PATRIOTIC CHURCHES, THE HOLY SEE 
HAS EXCELLENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION REGARDING 
DISSIDENTS, HUMAN RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND 
GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER THE POPULATION.  THERE IS A 
CONSTANT CONTROVERSY AROUND THE EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THIS 
ISSUE INVOLVES THE VATICAN\'S RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN AND

CHINA. 
 
12. (C) VIETNAM:  UNOFFICIAL DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE BETWEEN 
VIETNAM AND THE VATICAN ON ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS.  THE GOV\'S ATTEMPT TO CONTROL RELIGIOUS 
ORGANIZATIONS IS ONE OF THE MAIN STUMBLING BLOCKS FROM A 
VATICAN PERSPECTIVE.  THE VATICAN\'S ATTEMPTS TO APPOINT 
BISHOPS WITH MINIMAL GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE AND THE 
REPORTING PROVIDED BY ITS NUNCIO ON THESE EFFORTS CAN BE 
USED AS A GAUGE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
ISSUES IN VIETNAM. 
 
13. (C) INDIA:  INDIA HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT SECTARIAN 
VIOLENCE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AS MUCH AGAINST MUSLIMS 
AS CHRISTIANS.  RESOLUTION OF THIS VIOLENCE IS A KEY TO 
DEMOCRACY, STABILITY AND THE GUARANTEE OF HUMAN RIGHTS. 
THE VATICAN, LOCAL BISHOPS WHO REPORT TO THE VATICAN, AND 
VARIOUS MISSIONARY ORGANIZATIONS WILL ALL CONTINUE TO BE 
ACTIVE OBSERVERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND DEVELOPMENTS. 
 
14. (C) INDONESIA:  EAST TIMOR IS POISED TO BECOME THE 
SECOND CATHOLIC COUNTRY IN ASIA (THE OTHER IS THE 
PHILIPPINES).  THE VATICAN, THROUGH ITS BISHOPS, HAS BEEN 
DEEPLY INVOLVED IN RECONCILIATION EFFORTS FOR YEARS.  THE 
VATICAN IS INVOLVED IN RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS IN EAST 
TIMOR.  IN OTHER PARTS OF INDONESIA WRACKED BY SECTARIAN 
VIOLENCE, THE CATHOLIC PRESENCE IS LESS PRONOUNCED, BUT 
CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE 
SITUATION.  CATHOLIC PRELATES HAVE ALSO ACTED AS

KABILA BEGAN ON THE WRONG FOOT BECAUSE OF KABILA\'S 
MINDSET AND THE CHURCH\'S PREVIOUS ASSOCIATION WITH THE 
MOBUTU REGIME.  REAL HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS AND RELIGIOUS

THE POPE.  THAT SAID, VATICAN-GOC DIALOGUE HAS CONTINUED 
WITH FOLLOW-UP VISITS TO CUBA BY SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS 
-- AND TO THE VATICAN BY CUBAN COUNTERPARTS.  AMONG THE 
TOPICS OF DISCUSSION:  THE GOC\'S TREATMENT OF THE CUBAN 
CHURCH, THE STATUS OF DISSIDENTS, AND THE EFFECTS OF THE 
U.S. EMBARGO, ABOUT WHICH THE HOLY SEE SHARES CASTRO\'S 
CRITICISM.  THE VATICAN IS QUIETLY LOOKING AHEAD TO THE 
DAY WHEN FIDEL CASTRO DEPARTS THE SCENE.  IT IS CONCERNED 
HOWEVER, THAT HIS REPLACEMENT CAN ACTUALLY BE WORSE. 
 
EUROPE

18. (C) THE VATICAN WOULD LIKE TO SEE A UNIFIED, 
CHRISTIAN (IE. CATHOLIC) EUROPE.  AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE 
EXPECTED TO INTENSIFY ITS DIALOG WITH THE LEADING 
PROTESTANT GROUPS IN GERMANY AND SCANDINAVIA.  THE 
VATICAN WILL ALSO CONTINUE ATTEMPTS TO ENGAGE THE RUSSIAN 
CHURCH AND THE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH IN ISTANBUL IN AN 
ATTEMPT TO HEAL THE LATIN/ORTHODOX RIFT.  VATICAN 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE BALKANS CAN BE USEFUL TO U.S. POLICY 
IF IT IS DIRECTED AT PROMOTING CATHOLIC/ORTHODOX

19. (C) AREAS IN WHICH WE CAN WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH 
THE VATICAN DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS: 
 
-- ETHNIC RECONCILIATION AND CIVIL CULTURE - IN JUNE, 
PD/ECA DAS BRIAN SEXTON MET WITH VATICAN AND SANT\'EGIDIO 
OFFICIALS DURING A PD/ECA SPONSORED INTER-RELIGIOUS 
CONFERENCE ON BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA.  EMBASSY VATICAN, WITH 
DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP FOLLOW-UP 
PROJECTS; 
 
-- ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS -- POST HAS DEVELOPED TWO 
PROJECTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH CARITAS (THE VATICAN RELIEF 
NGO) AND WITH THE ARCHBISHOP OF PESCARA.  THESE PROJECTS 
WILL OFFER EDUCATION, RESCUE, REHABILITATION, AND 
REPATRIATION TO VICTIMS AND POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF HUMAN 
TRAFFICKERS.  WORKING WITH THE CURIA AND CARITAS THERE IS 
MUCH MORE GROUND TO BE COVERED IN THIS AREA IN THE NEAR 
FUTURE. 
 
--  BIOTECHNOLOGY AND AGRICULTURAL TRADE -- EMBASSY 
VATICAN HAS SPONSORED TWO DISCUSSIONS OF THIS THEME 
INVOLVING SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS ATTACHED TO THE VATICAN. 
PROMOTING A MORE POSITIVE VATICAN APPROACH TO APPROPRIATE 
USE OF GMOS IN THIRD WORLD AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT COULD 
HELP MAKE GMOS MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED EVEN IN THE DEVELOPED 
WORLD. 
 
20. (C) AREAS IN WHICH WE SHOULD EXPECT CONTINUED 
DIFFICULTIES DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS: 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03507  04 OF 04  031723Z 
--  THE MIDDLE EAST - THE VATICAN WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE 
U.S. EFFORTS TO ISOLATE SADDAM HUSSEIN.  WE SHOULD 
RECOGNIZE THAT THE VATICAN WILL NOT SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS 
IN IRAQ, AND INVESTIGATE WAYS TO LIMIT VATICAN 
INTERFERENCE WITH OUR OBJECTIVES.  IN ISRAEL, THE VATICAN 
WILL CONTINUE EFFORTS TO INSERT ITSELF ON THE QUESTION OF 
THE STATUS OF JERUSALEM; 
 
--  DEATH PENALTY - THE VATICAN WILL CONTINUE ITS 
CONDEMNATION OF THE DEATH PENALTY.  STATEMENTS BY THE 
POPE ARE LIKELY TO BE USED BY MANY AROUND THE WORLD TO 
CONDEMN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. THE 
DEPARTMENT SHOULD CONSIDER IF IT WANTS TO ADDRESS THE 
ISSUE, AND IF SO, WHAT PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AVENUES TO USE.

2.   (U) GENOA\'S ARCHBISHOP, CARDINAL DIONIGI TETTAMANZI, 
HAS REJECTED VIOLENT PROTESTS AGAINST THE G8 SUMMIT LATER 
THIS MONTH (REFTELS A AND B). IN AN INTERVIEW WITH CENTER- 
LEFT ITALIAN DAILY \"LA REPUBBLICA,\" THE CARDINAL DESCRIBED 
THE \"SEATTLE PEOPLE\" AS A NEW CULTURAL PHENOMENON. INSISTING 
THAT ORDINARY PEOPLE MUST HAVE A MEANS OF VOICING THEIR 
OPINIONS AND INFLUENCING THE ECONOMIC PROCESS, HE ALSO SAID 
THAT VIOLENCE IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT 
END. MEANWHILE, THOUSANDS OF YOUNG CATHOLICS ARE EXPECTED TO 
DESCEND ON GENOA JULY 7-8 FOR PRE-G8 PROTESTS. ORGANIZERS 
SAY THE YOUNG CATHOLICS ARE PROTESTING EARLY TO AVOID THE 
EXPECTED \"PANDEMONIUM\" DURING THE SUMMIT. A SPOKESMAN FOR 
THE CATHOLIC GROUPS SAID THEY HAD NOTHING AGAINST THE 
\"SEATTLE PEOPLE\" BUT THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO RUN THE RISK 
OF BEING DRAGGED INTO \"A DEGENERATION INTO VIOLENCE\". THE

CHRISTIANS EXPERIENCE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION. A 400-PAGE 
REPORT, THE THIRD OF ITS KIND, PROVIDED INFORMATION OF THE 
STATUS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN EACH OF THE WORLD\'S NATIONS. 
IT ALSO PROVIDED STATISTICAL INFORMATION ON NUMBERS OF 
RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS AND REFUGEES. AID TO THE CHURCH IN NEED 
ESTIMATES THAT 165,000 CHRISTIANS WERE KILLED LARGELY ON 
ACCOUNT OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS DURING 2000. THE VIOLENCE 
WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN INDONESIA, SUDAN, EAST TIMOR, INDIA 
AND EGYPT. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, DISCRIMINATION AND LEGAL 
SANCTIONS AGAINST CHRISTIANS WERE MOST OBVIOUS IN CHINA, 
SUDAN, INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND TURKMENISTAN. AID TO THE 
CHURCH IN NEED ALSO POINTED OUT MORE SUBTLE FORMS OF 
DISCRIMINATION IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE REPORT SAID A 
RECENT FRENCH BILL THAT CRIMINALIZES \"MENTAL MANIPULATION\" 
POTENTIALLY COULD BE TURNED AGAINST ANY PARENTS WHO RAISE 
THEIR CHILDREN IN A FAITH OR MONKS AND NUNS WHO LIVE IN 
COMMUNITIES THAT COULD BE VIEWED AS SECT-LIKE.

ETHICISTS TO WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THE MORAL ISSUES 
SURROUNDING THE TRANSPLANT OF ANIMAL ORGANS INTO HUMANS. IN 
A JULY 3 MESSAGE, THE PONTIFF SAID ANY MORAL RESPONSE MUST 
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY, POSSIBLE HEALTH 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPLANTING ORGANS FROM OTHER 
SPECIES AND ADEQUATE RESPECT FOR THE DONOR ANIMALS. THE POPE 
SAID XENOTRANSPLANT RESEARCH WAS IN THE INTEREST OF HUMANITY 
BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS LACK OF AVAILABLE HUMAN ORGANS, WHICH 
HAS LED TO MANY TRANSPLANT PATIENTS DYING WHILE STILL ON

THAT THE WORLD WAS TIRED OF \"THE OLD IDEOLOGIES\" WHICH HAVE 
LOST THEIR INITIAL FASCINATION AND HAVE LEFT MANY PEOPLE 
EXPERIENCING A DEEP EMPTINESS AND A LACK OF MEANING IN THEIR 
LIVES. HE SAID CUBA\'S PEOPLE HAD A RIGHT TO FREEDOM AND THAT 
THE CHURCH WOULD ACT IN THE NAME OF CHRIST TO FREE PEOPLE 
FROM EVERY FORM OF OPPRESSION. 
 
3.   SOME PRESS REPORTS SUGGESTED THE EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA 
COULD BE ON THE AGENDA JULY 23 FOR THE POTUS MEETING WITH

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.   THE VATICAN\'S CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM ABOUT BIOTECHNOLOGY WAS 
GIVEN A BOOST BY A JULY 5 MEETING POST ORGANIZED BETWEEN 
SENIOR GOVERNMENT EXPERTS AND DR. CHANNAPATNA PRAKASH, 
PROFESSOR OF PLANT MOLECULAR GENETICS AT TUSKEGEE 
UNIVERSITY, ALABAMA AND MEMBER OF THE USDA\'S AGRICULTURAL 
BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THE VATICAN CONFIRMED THAT 
IT HAS FEWER PROBLEMS WITH THE SCIENCE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY THAN 
WITH THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ETHICAL ISSUES LINKED TO THE 
PROCESSES. THE PROTAGONISTS AGREED THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY HAD 
THE POTENTIAL TO COMBAT WORLD HUNGER BY DEVELOPING DISEASE 
AND PEST RESISTANT PLANTS. VATICAN OFFICIALS EXPRESSED 
PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE PROCESSES TO INCREASE THE 
NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF SOME GRAINS AND PLANTS. THE VATICAN 
APPROACH TO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIO-ETHICS IN GENERAL IS BASED 
ON \"REASONABLE PRUDENCE.\" POST ARRANGED VATICAN MEDIA EVENTS 
TO FURTHER DISSEMINATE PRAKASH\'S MESSAGE. END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
LOVE THE IDEA, BUT... 
--------------------- 
 
2.   MEMBERS AND CONSULTANTS OF THE VATICAN\'S BIO-ETHICAL 
INSTITUTE, THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE, DISCUSSED THE 
PROS AND CONS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY WITH PROFESSOR CHANNAPATNA 
PRAKASH DURING A JULY 5 MEETING ORGANIZED BY POST IN VATICAN 
CITY. THE SCIENTIFIC ENCOUNTER WAS CHAIRED BY THE VATICAN\'S

PAGE 03        VATICA  03621  01 OF 02  091519Z 
\"MINISTER\" FOR BIO-ETHICAL ISSUES, BISHOP ELIO SGRECCIA. 
SGRECCIA WELCOMED THE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER THE VATICAN\'S 
REFLECTION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FROM THE START OF THE 
MEETING IT WAS CLEAR THAT VATICAN PARTICIPANTS WERE, IN 
THEORY, FAVORABLE TO THE BENEFITS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, 
PARTICULARLY FOR DEVELOPING NATIONS. THE SCIENTISTS DID 
EXPRESS CONCERN OVER THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF GMOS AS 
PRODUCTS OF DOMINEERING WESTERN MULTINATIONALS, OFTEN 
LABELED AS \"DIABOLICAL.\" PONTIFICAL ACADEMY MEMBERS 
SUGGESTED THAT DEVELOPING NATIONS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED AND 
ASSISTED TO DEVELOP IN-HOUSE SOLUTIONS TO THEIR FOOD AND 
AGRICULTURE PROBLEMS. THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT ABOUT THE 
POTENTIAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY BUT THE VATICAN DELEGATION 
INSISTED ON ADEQUATE CONTROLS TO MANAGE EXTRINSIC RISKS. 
PRAKASH POINTED OUT THAT IN THE US THE EPA, USDA AND FDA 
KEEP CLOSE SCRUTINY ON NEW BIOTECH PRODUCTS. ALL AGREED THAT 
KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING IMPACTED DIRECTLY ON THE PUBLIC 
PERCEPTION OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GMOS. 
 
3.   THE VATICAN DELEGATION INSISTED THAT EACH NEW BIOTECH 
PRODUCT SHOULD RECEIVE A SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT AND APPROVAL. 
IT REJECTED THE IDEA OF A GENERAL APPROVAL OF GMOS. THEY 
ALSO CALLED FOR COUNTRY SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT AND APPROVAL. 
ONE ACADEMICIAN POINTED OUT THAT ONLY 20 PERCENT OF U.S. 
LAND IS DEDICATED TO AGRICULTURE COMPARED TO 80 PERCENT OF 
ITALY\'S. HE OPINED THAT THE RISK FACTOR IN A NEW BIOTECH 
PRODUCT WAS GREATER FOR A COUNTRY LIKE ITALY THAN FOR THE 
US. THE VATICAN DELEGATES SAID THEIR APPROACH TO GENETIC 
SCIENCES IN GENERAL WAS GLOBAL IN NATURE AND THAT THEY 
CONSISTENTLY PUT THE INTERESTS OF PEOPLE FIRST. THE MEETING 
CONCLUDED WITH A WORKING LUNCH HOSTED BY BISHOP SGRECCIA.

TETTAMANZI OF GENOA IN ROME ON FRIDAY, JULY 6.  TETTAMANZI 
WAS IN ROME FOR MEETINGS WITH THE POPE, ITALIAN PRIME 
MINISTER BERLUSCONI, AND ITALIAN INTERIOR MINISTER SCAEOLA 
ON THE EVE OF THE G-8 SUMMIT.  HE SAID THAT ALL ARE ASKING 
HIM TO URGE RESTRAINT BY HIS MANY ANTI-GLOBALIZATION 
FOLLOWERS. 
 
2. (C) TETTAMANZI SAID THAT IF FACT, HE IS NOT ANTI- 
GLOBALIZATION, RATHER HE ACCEPTS IT AS A FACT, BUT WISHES 
THE WORLD LEADERS TO REALIZE THE NEED TO BETTER ADDRESS THE 
CONCERNS OF THE POOR COUNTRIES.  HE POINTED TO THE FACT 
THAT IN HIS RECENTLY RELEASED BOOK \"GLOBALIZATION: A 
CHALLENGE\", HE NOTES THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF GLOBALIZATION 
ON THIRD WORLD DEVELOPMENT.  THAT SAID, HE WOULD BE 
SUPPORTING PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS TO HIGHLIGHT THE PLIGHT

DEMONSTRATIONS, WHICH HE WILL BE INVOLVED IN, WOULD TAKE 
PLACE BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE SUMMIT, AND AFTER ITS 
CLOSE.

THERE ARE ONE OR TWO CATHOLIC PRIESTS WHO HE DESCRIBES AS 
\"RADICAL\" WHO WILL ACTIVELY TRY TO DISRUPT THE MEETINGS.

FOR POSSIBLE USE BY NOMINEE NICHOLSON\'S OPENING STATEMENT: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
IN 1984 THE UNITED STATES JOINED 107 OTHER COUNTRIES, 
INCLUDING ALL OF OUR WESTERN ALLIES, WHEN WE ESTABLISHED 
NORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE.  THE HOLY SEE 
IS AN ENTITY THAT, UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, HAS AN 
INTERNATIONAL \"PERSONALITY\" WHICH GIVES THE JURIDICAL 
EQUIVALENT OF A STATE AND THAT HAS ITS TERRITORIAL 
MANIFESTATION IN THE VATICAN CITY STATE.  IN THE CONTEXT OF 
THE DAY, THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP MADE A LOT OF SENSE: IT 
HELPED US MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH HOLY SEE AGAINST COMMUNISM 
AND THREATS TO WORLD SECURITY IN WANING DAYS OF COLD WAR. 
 
AT THAT TIME THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT ESTABLISHING THIS 
RELATIONSHIP WOULD INFRINGE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL SEPARATION 
OF CHURCH AND STATE.  I THINK THAT THE WORK OF OUR EMBASSY 
DURING THE INTERVENING YEARS HAS BORNE OUT THE WISDOM OF 
ESTABLISHING THIS RELATIONSHIP.  THAT WORK HAS FOCUSED ON 
THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OF THE DAY. 
 
DURING THOSE YEARS THE VERY SMALL STAFF OF OUR EMBASSY TO 
THE HOLY SEE HAS PROVIDED INVALUABLE REPORTING ON VATICAN 
EFFORTS TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESOLVE CONFLICTS AROUND 
THE WORLD.  IT HAS HELPED TO SUSTAIN A COMMON FRONT AGAINST 
AGGRESSION IN PLACES AS DIVERSE AS KOSOVO AND IRAQ, AND IT 
HAS WORKED WITH VATICAN COUNTERPARTS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IN 
AFRICA -- MOST NOTABLY IN MOZAMBIQUE. 
 
(NOTE: EMBASSY STAFF CONSISTS OF THREE FOREIGN SERVICE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03756  01 OF 02  131452Z 
OFFICERS AND ABOUT A DOZEN LOCALLY HIRED STAFF). 
 
THE TIMES ARE CHANGING.  IN THIS NEW MILLENIUM MANY THREATS 
TO OUR SECURITY AND PROSPERITY ARE GLOBAL IN NATURE -- AND 
HOLY SEE CAN BE A USEFUL PARTNER ON MANY ISSUES AND IN MANY 
AREAS OF THE WORLD: 
 
EXAMPLES OF WHERE WE ARE COLLABORATING OR CAN COLLABORATE 
FRUITFULLY WITH THE HOLY SEE: 
 
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES: 
 
-- FIGHTING AIDS, ESPECIALLY IN AFRICA; PROMOTING 
RESPONSIBLE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY IN AGRICULTURE; DEBT 
RELIEF. 
 
SECURITY ISSUES: 
 
--  ENDING REGIONAL CONFLICTS (CONGO, BURUNDI, SUDAN, 
NAGORNO-KARABAKH), 
 
--  INTER-COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION (OUR EMBASSY HAS DEVELOPED 
PROJECTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE VATICAN AFFILIATED LAY 
COMMUNITY OF SANT\'EGIDIO IN THE BALKANS, AND IN MOZAMBIQUE), 
 
--  EUROPEAN SECURITY (THE POPE\'S OUTREACH TO ORTHODOX FITS 
WITH OUR OWN INTEREST IN PROMOTING \"A EUROPE WHOLE AND 
FREE\"). 
 
DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES: 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  03756  01 OF 02  131452Z 
-- HOLY SEE IS A VALUABLE PARTNER IN PROMOTING DEMOCRACY 
ABROAD (CUBA, CHINA, MIDDLE EAST, ETC.) 
 
--  VERY IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM; OUR EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE PLAYS UNIQUE 
ROLE IN SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT 
OF 1998 BY SHARING INFORMATION ON PROBLEM AREAS LITERALLY 
AROUND THE ENTIRE WORLD, WHERE THE HOLY SEE, UNIQUELY AMONG 
SMALL \"COUNTRIES\" HAS IMPORTANT PRESENCE THROUGH THE ROMAN 
CATHOLIC CHURCH AND ITS MISSIONARY AND SPECIALIZED COUNCILS. 
 
TO ELABORATE, 
 
EMBASSY VATICAN IS KEEPING CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE HOLY SEE 
IN REGARD TO QUESTIONS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CHINA.  THE 
VATICAN SHARES U.S. CONCERNS ON THE NEED TO PROMOTE 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CHINA.  THE VATICAN DOES NOT HAVE 
OFFICIAL TIES WITH CHINA.  IT DOES HOWEVER MAINTAIN FORMAL 
DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH TAIWAN.  THIS IS A UNIQUE DIPLOMATIC 
SITUATION ON THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT. 
 
WE FOLLOW WITH INTEREST THE EFFORTS OF THE VATICAN AND 
CARITAS, THE VATICAN\'S ARM FOR HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, TO 
ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING OF THE POPULATION OF NORTH KOREA.

THE ESTIMATED 2,000-4,000 CATHOLICS IN NORTH KOREA. 
 
WE ARE KEEPING TRACK OF VATICAN DISCUSSIONS WITH VIETNAM ON 
THE STATUS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN VIETNAM AND THE 
EVENTUAL ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICIAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
BETWEEN VIETNAM AND THE HOLY SEE. 
 
NOT TO SAY WE AGREE ON EVERYTHING -- WE HAVE DIFFERENCES ON 
MEPP, ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS, AND 
ON SOCIAL ISSUES LIKE THE DEATH PENALTY.  BUT THESE 
DIFFERENCES ARE A NATURAL PART OF ANY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP. 
ON GLOBALIZATION, FOR EXAMPLE, WE MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO 
THE POPE\'S CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, WHICH HE SEEKS TO 
COMMUNICATE OVER THE DIN OF ANARCHIC BABBLE WE SEE IN GENOA 
THIS WEEK.  THE VATICAN URGES THE CREATION OF AN 
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY THAT IS MORE SUPPORTIVE OF POOR, MORE 
SHARING OF TECHNOLOGY AND KNOWLEDGE AND LESS UNEQUAL IN 
DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH -- PRECISELY TO MAKE THE WORD A MORE 
STABLE AND PROSPEROUS PLACE FOR ALL OF US. 
 
I WILL MAKE SURE THAT OUR EMBASSY TO HOLY SEE WILL BE A 
VALUABLE TOOL TO PROMOTE U.S. VIEWS ACROSS ALL THESE AREAS 
AND MORE -- AND TO MAKE IT A VALUABLE \"LISTENING POST\" TO 
BENEFIT FROM THE KNOWLEDGE AND VIEWS OF ONE OF THE WORLD\'S 
MOST SOPHISTICATED AND GLOBALLY ACTIVE DIPLOMATIC CORPS.

3.   VATICAN SPOKESMAN, JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS HAS ACCUSED 
UNNAMED WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS OF TRYING TO PUT \"A SPIN\" ON 
THE POPE\'S WORDS TO PRESIDENT BUSH. WHEN POPE JOHN PAUL II 
MET THE PRESIDENT JULY 23 HE CONDEMNED THE \"CREATION FOR 
RESEARCH PURPOSES OF HUMAN EMBRYOS.\" NAVARRO-VALLS SAID JULY 
25 THAT THE POPE WAS NOT OPENING THE POSSIBILITY OF AN 
ETHICAL USE AND DESTRUCTION OF EMBRYOS CREATED FOR OTHER 
PURPOSES. BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE CITED AS SAYING 
THE POPE\'S WORDS, WHILE CLEARLY REFERRING TO EMBRYOS CREATED 
FOR RESEARCH, MIGHT NOT COVER OTHER EMBRYOS, SUCH AS THOSE 
CREATED FOR IN VITRO FERTILIZATION BUT NOT IMPLANTED IN A 
UTERUS. NAVARRO-VALLS STATED THAT THE DELIBERATE DESTRUCTION 
OF A HUMAN EMBRYO - NO MATTER HOW OR WHY IT WAS CREATED - IS 
MORALLY UNACCEPTABLE, EVEN IF THE AIM IS TO HELP OTHERS. 
(NOTE. WHEN A VATICAN-BASED JOURNALIST ACCUSED NAVARRO-VALLS 
OF PUTTING HIS OWN \"SPIN\" ON THE POPE\'S SPEECH, HE RETORTED, 
\"NO, IT IS NOT SPIN, IT IS THE TRUTH.\" END NOTE).

VATICAN NEWS AGENCY: OLYMPICS OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE CHINA 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
4.   THE DIRECTOR OF VATICAN MISSIONARY NEWS AGENCY \"FIDES,\" 
FATHER BERNARDO CERVELLERA, SUPPORTS BEIJING HOSTING THE 
2008 OLYMPIC GAMES. IN A JULY 13 STATEMENT, CERVELLERA SAID 
REFUSING TO GIVE CHINA THE GAMES WOULD HAVE BEEN 
UNPRODUCTIVE AND HYPOCRITICAL. HE POINTED OUT THAT AUSTRALIA 
HAD BEEN AWARDED THE 2000 OLYMPICS DESPITE A LONG HISTORY OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AGAINST ITS ABORIGINAL POPULATION. 
CERVELLERA SAID THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES WOULD PROBABLY USE 
THE GAMES \"AS A SORT OF DRUG TO SOFTEN THE HARDSHIPS OF THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  03976  01 OF 02  282136Z 
COMING YEARS\" AS IT FACES ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES. HOWEVER, 
ACCORDING TO CERVELLERA, A TIME OF HARDSHIP AND STRUGGLE IS 
NOT WHEN A NATION SHOULD BE IGNORED - RATHER IT IS A TIME TO 
ENGAGE IT. \"THE ALTERNATIVE IS ISOLATION, WHICH WOULD ALLOW 
THE REGIME TO COMPLETELY SUFFOCATE ALL DISSIDENCE,\" HE SAID. 
THE PRIEST ADDED THAT WHILE CHINA WAS LIKELY TO INCREASE 
SECURITY MEASURES DURING THE GAMES, THERE IS NO WAY IT CAN 
PREVENT INTERACTION BETWEEN CHINESE CITIZENS AND THE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF ATHLETES AND TOURISTS WHO WILL TRAVEL TO 
BEIJING FOR THE OLYMPICS.

6.   THE VATICAN PRESS OFFICE HAS CONFIRMED POPE JOHN PAUL 
II\'S SEPTEMBER 22-27 VISIT TO ARMENIA AND KAZAKHSTAN.  THE 
LEADER OF THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH, CATHOLICOS KAREKIN 
II OF ETCHMIADZIN, INVITED THE POPE TO JOIN IN CELEBRATIONS 
IN HONOR OF THE 1,700TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE 
NATION.  THE VISIT WILL INCLUDE CEREMONIES WITH MINORITY 
CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS IMPORTANT ECUMENICAL EVENTS. 
(NOTE. THE VATICAN HAS A WARM RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ARMENIAN 
APOSTOLIC CHURCH (ONE OF SIX INDEPENDENT ORIENTAL ORTHODOX 
CHURCHES) AND SEVERAL DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCES HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN RESOLVED. MANY ECUMENISTS REGARD THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN 
THE VATICAN AND THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH AS A MODEL FOR 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER ORTHODOX CHURCHES. MUCH OF THE 
SUCCESS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CLOSE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN POPE 
JOHN PAUL II AND THE LATE CATHOLICOS, KAREKIN I. END NOTE).

PEACE.  DON MATTEO SAID HE HAD BEEN APPROACHED BY AN 
UNNAMED \"GOOD CONTACT\" IN UNITA WHO HAD SHARED A PROPOSAL 
FOR STOPPING HOSTILITIES AND INITIATING MEDIATION.  DON 
MATTEO SAID THE UNITA OFFICIAL PROPOSED THAT SANT\'EGIDIO 
HOST A SMALL \"SECRET\" MEETING OF UNITA AND GOA 
REPRESENTATIVES AT SANT\'EGIDIO HEADQUARTERS IN ROME.  THE 
PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING WOULD BE TO ESTABLISH THE FRAMEWORK 
FOR A CEASEFIRE, AFTER WHICH UNITA WOULD BE WILLING TO

AUTHORITY PRESIDENT ARAFAT EARLIER ON THE DAY.  TAURAN HAD 
HAD A CONCURRENT MEETING WITH ARAFAT\'S DELEGATION, 
INCLUDING MEMBERS OF ARAFAT\'S NEGOTIATING TEAM.  TAURAN 
UNDERSCORED THE VATICAN\'S VIEW THAT THE SITUATION IS QUITE 
SERIOUS, AND THEIR VIEW THAT THE VIOLENCE HAD CROSSED AN 
IMPORTANT AND WORRISOME THRESHOLD AT THE WAILING WALL 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK. (NOTE: A VATICAN PRIORITY IN THE MEPP 
IS PROTECTION OF THE HOLY PLACES).  TAURAN SAID THE POPE 
WANTS THE PRESIDENT TO KNOW ARAFAT IS READY TO ACCEPT ANY 
TYPE OF OBSERVERS IN ORDER TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. 
THE POPE SPECIFICALLY ASKED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH EXERCISE

BELIEVED PRESIDENT BUSH \"HOLDS THE KEY TO THIS.\" 
RESPONDING TO CHARGE\'S QUERY, TAURAN UNDERSCORED THAT 
ARAFAT TOLD THEM HE WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL 
OBSERVERS OF ANY SORT -- INCLUDING JUST U.S. ONES. 
 
2.  (C)  TAURAN ALSO SAID EGYPTIAN FM MOUSSA RECENTLY 
CALLED AND SAID THAT THE SITUATION WAS \"VERY SERIOUS,\" 
WHICH TAURAN TOOK TO MEAN THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE 
VIOLENCE SPREADING WAS GROWING.  IN RESPONSE TO CHARGE\'S 
QUESTION, TAURAN ADMITTED THAT THE VATICAN HAS NOT HAD ANY 
RECENT CONTACTS WITH THE ISRAELI SIDE.  (NOTE: TAURAN 
DIDN\'T EVEN REMEMBER THE ISRAELI HOLY SEE AMBASSADOR\'S NAME 
-- AN INDICATION OF HOW DISTANT THE VATICAN NOW IS FROM THE 
GOI).  TAURAN REMINDED US THAT HE HAD FIRST MENTIONED THE 
NEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER FORCE LAST NOVEMBER. 
WHILE THE VATICAN SUPPORTS THE MITCHELL PLAN, TAURAN 
BELIEVED THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE VIOLENCE NOW IS WITH THE 
HELP OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (IE. AN OBSERVER 
FORCE). 
 
3.  (C)  IN A SIDE NOTE, TAURAN, WHO HAD TOLD  US LAST YEAR 
THAT HE THOUGHT ARAFAT WAS \"LOSING IT\" BOTH MENTALLY AND 
PHYSICALLY, NOW OBSERVED ARAFAT TO BE MENTALLY SHARP AND 
ENGAGED, WHILE PERHAPS DETERIORATING PHYSICALLY WITH 
PARKINSON\'S-LIKE SYMPTOMS.

DID NOT SAY WHETHER THE VATICAN CONSULTED WITH THE ITALIAN

PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE AND MEMBER OF THE 
U.N.\'S \"EMINENT PERSONS\" GROUP OF ADVISORS, SAID THE WCAR 
MUST BE AWARE OF THE MODERN MANIFESTATIONS OF INEQUALITY. 
FOLLOWING THE ROUND TABLE TALKS AT THE GENEVA OFFICES OF THE 
UNHCR, THE CARDINAL STATED THAT \"THE ANTIRACISM OF YESTERDAY 
SEEMS UNSUITED TODAY AND NEEDS NOT ONLY TO REVIVE ITS 
PERMANENT CONVICTIONS BUT ALSO TO RENEW ITS REASONING, EVEN 
SOMETIMES TO CHANGE ITS TARGET.\"  HE WARNED THAT NEW 
PERMUTATIONS OF RACISM MIGHT BEST BE FOUGHT BY NEW METHODS. 
 
2.   (SBU) POLOFF AND POL INTERN MET AUGUST 2 WITH KISHORE 
JAYABALAN, ASSISTANT TO FRANK DEWANE, UNDERSECRETARY OF THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE, TO DISCUSS THE 
HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS ON THE WORLD CONFERENCE ON RACISM.  (NOTE: 
DEWANE WAS THE VATICAN REPRESENTATIVE AT 1ST WEEK SESSION OF 
WCAR IN GENEVA).  THE HOLY SEE GENERALLY SHARES USG 
POSITIONS ON CONTROVERSIAL AREAS OF THE WCAR DOCUMENTS, 
SPECIFICALLY REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY, ZIONISM AS RACISM 
LANGUAGE, AND \"ISLAMAPHOBIA.\" 
 
3.   (SBU) LIKE THE USG, THE HOLY SEE WOULD PREFER THE WCAR 
TO BE A FORWARD LOOKING CONFERENCE, FOCUSING MORE ON 
CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS THAN APOLOGIES FOR WRONGS COMMITTED 
GENERATIONS AGO.  THEY WOULD RATHER DISCUSS MODERN 
TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS THAN REPARATIONS FOR THE SLAVE 
TRADE FROM AFRICA - ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS IGNORES ALL OTHER 
SLAVE TRADES, PAST AND PRESENT.  IN ADDITION, THE VATICAN 
HAD RESERVATIONS ON THE PARAGRAPHS DEALING WITH THE 
HOLOCAUST.  JAYABALAN DID SAY THAT THIS WAS A MORE TIMELY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04202  091340Z 
AND RELEVANT ISSUE THAN SLAVERY REPARATIONS, AS THERE ARE 
LIVING HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. 
 
4.   (SBU) ACCORDING TO JAYABALAN, THE HOLY SEE ALSO 
OBJECTED TO THE `ZIONISM AS RACISM\' LANGUAGE.  CITING THE 
EXAMPLES OF NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE BALKANS, HE SAID THEY 
VIEW RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION AS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM 
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON ETHNICITY OR RACE, ALTHOUGH NO LESS 
GRIEVOUS AN OFFENSE.  A RELIGION IS A CHOICE OR A SYSTEM OF 
BELIEFS, NOT AN INHERITED TRAIT. 
 
5.   (SBU) MR. JAYABALAN THOUGHT THE WCAR DOCUMENTS LACKED A 
CLEAR AND CURRENT FOCUS.  HE SAW THEM AS OVERLOADED WITH 
INDIVIDUAL PET PROJECTS, WITH NO CLEAR FOCUS OR GOAL FOR THE 
CONFERENCE AS A WHOLE.  JAYABALAN BELIEVED THAT THESE 
INDIVIDUAL ISSUES, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD 
NOT MAKE IT PAST THE PREPCON. 
 
6.   (SBU) COMMENT: WHILE THE HOLY SEE MAY SHARE USG VIEWS 
ON MANY OF THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THE WCAR, THEY TEND TO 
LIMIT ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN DEBATES TO TOPICS OF PARAMOUNT 
IMPORTANCE TO THE VATICAN, SUCH AS ABORTION.  THEY CAN, 
HOWEVER, BE A USEFUL PARTNER BEHIND THE SCENES, ESPECIALLY 
WITH COUNTRIES (E.G. LIBYA, IRAQ) WITH WHICH THE USG HAS 
LITTLE LEVERAGE.  END COMMENT.  MERANTE

WAR II ERA WAS SIMPLY AN INTERNAL MATTER OF PROCEDURE AND 
NOT A POLITICAL ONE. ALTHOUGH LATER HE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD 
BEEN TURNED INTO A POLITICAL ISSUE THROUGH A DISTORTION OF 
FACTS RELATED TO THE WORKINGS OF A JEWISH-VATICAN COMMISSION 
STUDYING PIUS XII\'S ROLE DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR. 
GUMPEL PROFFERED COPIES OF HIS STATEMENT, WRITTEN WITH

PIUS XI (1922-1939) WILL BE COMPLETED IN 2009 AT THE LATEST. 
GUMPEL SAID HE HOPES FOR AN EARLIER COMPLETION DATE. (NOTE. 
THE PIUS XI DOCUMENTS WILL CONTAIN MATERIAL RELATED TO PIUS 
XII WHEN, AS CARDINAL EUGENIO PACELLI, HE WAS PIUS XI\'S 
SECRETARY OF STATE Q PM EQUIVALENT - FROM 1930 UNTIL 1939. 
 
SIPDIS 
END NOTE). WORK TO CLASSIFY AND CATALOGUE MATERIAL RELATED 
TO POPE PIUS XII (1939-1958) WOULD NORMALLY COMMENCE IN 
2009. GUMPEL POINTED OUT THAT FOUR JESUITS HAD BEEN GIVEN 
ACCESS TO THE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS AND HAD SPENT 
17 YEARS (1964-1981) SORTING OUT ALL/ALL THE DIPLOMATIC 
MATERIAL RELATING TO PIUS XII\'S ACTIVITY DURING THE SECOND 
WORLD WAR. THESE WERE THE PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE 12 VOLUMES 
TO HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY THE COMMISSION.  (COMMENT: IT IS 
POST\'S UNDERSTANDING THAT IT CURRENTLY IS LOGISTICALLY 
IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN UP THE VATICAN ARCHIVES RELATED TO PIUS 
XII\'S ACTIVITIES DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR. GUMPEL SAID IT 
CONSISTS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED BOXES (THROUGH WHICH THE JESUITS 
WENT PAPER-BY-PAPER EXTRACTING ALL DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENTS FOR 
REVIEW) AND MILLIONS OF SHEETS OF PAPER.  MANY OF THESE ARE 
PASTORAL DOCUMENTS (LETTERS TO PRIESTS, ETC) THAT HAVE 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE HOLOCAUST, BUT WHICH COULD PROVE 
EMBARRASSING TO LIVING PEOPLE.  IT TOOK FOUR HIGHLY

MOTIVATED, INTELLIGENT, MULTILINGUAL JESUITS 17 YEARS TO 
SORT THROUGH AND PUBLISH THE MATERIAL. END COMMENT.)  THE 
VATICAN INSISTS THE OTHER DOCUMENTS WILL BE OPEN TO SCRUTINY 
ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND CATALOGUED AND NOT 
BEFORE.  TWO ARCHIVISTS STAFF THE VATICAN ARCHIVE.  GUMPEL 
ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS INADEQUATE AND THAT HE HAS REQUESTED 
AN INCREASE IN PERSONNEL PRECISELY TO SPEED US THE PROCESS. 
GUMPEL INFORMED US THAT THIS ARCHIVAL PROCEDURE HAD BEEN 
CLEARLY EXPLAINED TO THE SCHOLARS ON THE COMMISSION OVER THE 
COURSE OF MANY CONVERSATIONS.

ACRIMONY FROM THE COMMISSION\'S WORK

3. (C)  GUMPEL RECOUNTED AN OCTOBER 2000 MEETING HE HAD 
BEEN ASKED TO ATTEND WITH MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH-VATICAN 
COMMISSION STUDYING PIUS XII\'S ROLE IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR. 
THE MEETING WAS TAPE-RECORDED WITH THE CONSENT OF ALL THOSE 
PRESENT. GUMPEL ASSERTED TO US THAT MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMISSION HAD BEEN WORKING IN AN UNSCHOLARLY WAY AND THAT 
THEIR METHODOLOGY HAD BEEN FLAWED.  NONE OF THE COMMISSION 
MEMBERS HAD READ ALL THE PUBLISHED DOCUMENTS, AND MOST WERE 
NOT ABLE TO READ THE DOCUMENTS IN THE ORIGINAL ITALIAN AND 
HAD TO RELY ON TRANSLATED SUMMARIES. GUMPEL NOTED THAT FROM 
A SCHOLARLY PERSPECTIVE, THIS SITUATION WAS \"LESS THAN 
IDEAL.\"  THE COMMISSION\'S REPORT, WHICH CONSISTED OF 46 
COMPLEX QUESTIONS, GUMPEL HAD PREPARED TO ANSWER.  HE WORKED 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

HAD NO INTENT TO THOROUGHLY EXPLORE THE QUESTIONS SINCE THEY 
ONLY ALLOCATED THREE HOURS TO THEIR ENCOUNTER.  MOREOVER, 
AFTER REVIEWING DOSSIERS ON ONLY 12 QUESTIONS, SOME OF THE 
COMMISSION MEMBERS LAUNCHED INTO POLEMICAL ATTACKS ON THE 
HOLY SEE FOR ITS ALLEGED LACK OF COOPERATION.  SOME 
COMMISSION MEMBERS LATER MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT A LACK 
OF SUCH ON HIS PART. GUMPEL LAMENTED THE AGGRESSIVE POSITION 
TAKEN TOWARDS HIM PERSONALLY BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMISSION AND THE LACK OF PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC COHESION IN 
THE GROUP OF HISTORIANS AS A WHOLE.  HE HAS DEPOSITED THE 
TAPES OF THE MEETING WITH THE VATICAN.  HIGH LEVEL VATICAN 
OFFICIALS HAVE LISTENED TO THE RECORDINGS AND EXPRESSED 
REGRET AT THE UNSCHOLARLY METHODOLOGY OF SOME OF THE JEWISH 
MEMBERS. THOSE SAME VATICAN OFFICIALS, HE SAID, EXPRESSED 
APPRECIATION FOR FR. GUMPEL\'S ACUTE KNOWLEDGE OF THE 
SITUATION AND HIS SCIENTIFIC PROFESSIONALISM.  GUMPEL MADE 
IT CLEAR TO A/DCM THAT EVEN POPE JOHN PAUL II IS AWARE OF 
THE SITUATION.

4. (C)  GUMPEL WAS PERSONALLY PAINED BY SOME OF THE AD 
HOMINUM COMMENTARY DIRECTED AT HIM BY JEWISH MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMISSION AND OTHER JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS.  HE STRESSED TO 
A/DCM THAT HE HAS REFRAINED FROM CHARACTERIZING THE WORK OF 
CERTAIN COMMISSION MEMBERS \"UNTIL NOW\" AS A PROFESSIONAL 
COURTESY AND OUT OF RESPECT.  HOWEVER, HE WARNED THAT IF 
ATTACKS AND FALSEHOODS CONTINUED, HE WOULD RELEASE THE TAPES 
OF THE MEETINGS. (NOTE: GUMPEL INSINUATED THAT THE RELEASE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04258  02 OF 02  131206Z 
TO THE TAPES WOULD PROVE TO BE EMBARRASSING FOR SOME OF THE 
COMMISSION MEMBERS, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE COMMISSION ITSELF 
WAS \"IN CRISIS\" BECAUSE OF CERTAIN MEMBERS\' UNPROFESSIONAL 
BEHAVIOR.  END NOTE).  GUMPEL ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT 
REFERENCES IN THE MEDIA AND IN OTHER COMMENTS TO HIM AS THE 
\"GERMAN JESUIT.\"   GUMPEL TOLD A/DCM THAT HIS FAMILY HAD 
BEEN VICTIMS OF NAZI PERSECUTION AND SEVERAL HAD BEEN KILLED 
BY THE NAZIS.  HE HIMSELF HAD TO FLEE NAZI GERMANY AS A 
REFUGEE, FIRST TO FRANCE AND THEN LATER TO HOLLAND.  HE 
RECALLED THAT AT ONE POINT A REPORTER HAD PLANNED TO PRINT 
AN ASSERTION THAT GUMPEL WAS A NAZI HIMSELF -- SOMETHING 
GUMPEL SAID WAS LIBELOUS, AND WHICH HE WAS MORE THAN WILLING 
TO GO TO COURT TO FIGHT. 
 
5. (C)  GUMPEL SAID HE WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN THE JEWISH- 
VATICAN COMMISSION DECIDED TO SUSPEND ITS WORK. HE CLAIMED 
THAT SOME OF ITS MEMBERS HAD AGENDAS THAT WENT BEYOND THE 
SCOPE OF THE COMMISSION\'S MANDATE (TO STUDY THE TWELVE 
VOLUMES).   OBJECTIONS ABOUT A LACK OF ACCESS TO THE VATICAN 
ARCHIVES OR ABOUT THE VATICAN HAVING SOMETHING TO HIDE ARE, 
IN GUMPEL\'S OPINION, A SMOKE SCREEN FOR POLITICAL AGENDAS 
WHICH HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH THE SERIOUS HISTORICAL STUDY 
THAT IS HIS LIFE.  HE CLOSED BY SAYING THAT THE VATICAN 
WANTS TO LET PASS A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE REOPENING THIS 
DISCUSSION.  HE SAID THAT THE VATICAN AND HE HIMSELF WERE 
MORE THAN WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY ANOMALIES OR QUESTIONS 
RELATING TO THE 12-VOLUME HISTORY ALREADY PUBLISHED.  THEY 
JUST DIDN\'T THINK THAT THE JUST-DISBANDED COMMISSION 
CONSISTED OF THE RIGHT MIX OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO SO.

NEEDED TO DEMONSTRATE COMMITMENT TO LUSAKA BEFORE MOVING 
FARTHER.  HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT UNITA WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE 
AN UNQUALIFIED STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF LUSAKA, AND EVEN 
THOUGHT THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT KIDNAPPING (WHILE NOT

CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT UNITA WOULD NOT BE PUSHED TOO FAR

2.   POPE JOHN PAUL II APPEALED AUGUST 19 TO LEBANESE 
AUTHORITIES NOT TO SACRIFICE THE \"VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND 
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY\" BECAUSE OF TRANSITORY POLITICAL 
INTERESTS. RESPONDING TO THE DETENTION OF CHRISTIAN ANTI- 
SYRIAN ACTIVISTS IN LEBANON, THE PONTIFF SAID THAT A 
\"PLURALISTIC AND FREE LEBANON\" IS OF BENEFIT TO THE ENTIRE 
MIDDLE EAST REGION. IN A REGULAR SUNDAY ADDRESS, THE POPE 
SAID LEBANON ALREADY SUFFERED FROM INTERNAL DIVISIONS. THE 
PAPAL APPEAL FOR LEBANON WAS GIVEN FRONT-PAGE PROMINENCE IN 
THE AUGUST 20 EDITION OF THE VATICAN\'S SEMI-OFFICIAL DAILY 
\"L\'OSSERVATORE ROMANO.\" THE TEXT OF THE POPE\'S WORDS WAS 
FOLLOWED BY A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE EVENTS SURROUNDING

THE ITALIAN TREASURY ANNOUNCED AUGUST 17 THAT IT WILL MINT A 
SMALL QUANTITY OF EURO COINS FOR THE VATICAN BEARING THE 
IMAGE OF THE POPE. UNDER AN ACCORD WITH ITALY SIGNED EARLIER 
THIS YEAR, THE VATICAN WILL BE PERMITTED AN ANNUAL MAXIMUM 
OF EUROS 670,000 (US DOLLARS 615,000), WHICH IS ABOUT THE 
SAME MINTED UNTIL NOW IN ITALIAN LIRA. LIKE OTHER 
PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES, THE VATICAN WILL DESIGN ONE SIDE OF 
ITS EURO COINS; THE OTHER SIDE IS COMMON TO THE WHOLE EURO 
ZONE. IN THE PAST, EUROPEAN NEWSPAPERS HAVE REPORTED THAT 
AUTHORITIES IN FRANCE RESISTED VATICAN EUROS BEARING AN 
IMAGE OF THE POPE BECAUSE OF CHURCH-STATE CONCERNS.

4.   COMMENTS TO THE PRESS BY THE PAPAL REPRESENTATIVE IN 
BULGARIA, ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO MENNINI, HAVE IGNITED 
SPECULATION ABOUT A 2002 VISIT TO SOFIA BY POPE JOHN PAUL 
II. SPEAKING TO JOURNALISTS AFTER A MEETING AT THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY, MENNINI SAID BULGARIAN AUTHORITIES \"ARE LOOKING 
FORWARD\" TO A PAPAL VISIT. ALTHOUGH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN 
BULGARIA HAS OBJECTED TO A PAPAL VISIT, ARCHBISHOP MENNINI 
SAID A VISIT FROM THE POPE WOULD BE \"A CLEAR SIGN OF THE 
RESPECT WE HAVE FOR THE BULGARIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.\"

AUGUST 23, OF U.S. CARDINAL THEODORE MCCARRICK\'S ASSESSMENT 
OF THE SITUATION REGARDING THE \"MARRIAGE\" OF ZAMBIAN 
ARCHBISHOP EMMANUEL MILINGO TO A KOREAN WOMAN, MARIA SUNG. 
BEGIN TEXT: OUR HEARTS ARE TROUBLED BY THE PAIN WHICH MARIA 
SUNG UNDOUBTEDLY FEELS AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME IN HER LIFE. 
WHILE SHE MAY BELIEVE SHE IS DOING THE RIGHT THING, IN ALL 
LIKELIHOOD HER ACTIONS ARE THE RESULT OF A PROCESS OF 
PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE AND UNREALISTIC REASONING. THE TRUTH 
IS THE CEREMONY THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY REVEREND MOON HAS NO 
REAL CONNECTION WITH TRUE MARRIAGE AND EVEN LESS WITH 
CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE. IT WAS BASED ON A BELIEF IN THE DIVINE 
MISSION OF MR. MOON AND NOT ON THE DIVINITY OF JESUS CHRIST. 
YET, IT IS THIS DIVINITY THAT GIVES THE TRUE SACRAMENTAL 
CHARACTER TO CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE. WE WHO PROFESS OUR BELIEF 
IN THE ESSENTIAL AND PERMANENT CHARACTER OF THE SACRAMENT OF 
MATRIMONY ALSO BELIEVE WITH EQUAL CONVICTION IN THE 
SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS, BY WHICH A MAN, BE HE PRIEST OR 
BISHOP, IS BOUND BY THE GRAVE BONDS OF HIS PROMISES OF 
CELIBACY AND FIDELITY THAT HE FREELY PROFESSED AT 
ORDINATION. THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS ELEMENTS OF A PRIEST\'S 
VOCATION, EVEN MORE SO WHEN THAT PRIEST IS A BISHOP. THEY 
ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. THE BISHOP\'S UNION WITH THE

1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE VATICAN IS STRONGLY URGING U.S. 
PRESENCE AT WCAR, AT LEAST AT THE WORKING LEVEL. 
ACKNOWLEDGING U.S. CONCERNS, DELEGATION DEPUTY AND AMCIT 
MONSIGNOR FRANK DEWANE PLEDGED VATICAN WILLINGNESS TO WORK 
FOR COMPROMISES IN THE FINAL WCAR DOCUMENT.  NONETHELESS, 
MSGR. DEWANE TOLD POLOFF THAT WCAR CANNOT IGNORE A PATTERN 
OF WHAT HE TERMED RACIAL DISCRIMINATION WITHIN ISRAEL, 
ACCENTUATED SINCE THE BREAKDOWN OF THE PEACE PROCESS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) POLOFF MET 8/27 WITH VATICAN WCAR DELEGATION DEPUTY 
AND AMCIT MONSIGNOR FRANK DEWANE.  MSGR. DEWANE 
ACKNOWLEDGED U.S. SENSITIVITIES ABOUT THE DURBAN CONFERENCE 
WHICH HAD LED TO THE DECISION AGAINST ATTENDANCE BY THE 
SECRETARY.  HOWEVER, MSGR. DEWANE URGED SOME FORM OF U.S. 
 
SIPDIS 
ATTENDANCE, AT LEAST AT THE WORKING LEVEL.  APART FROM THE 
NEED FOR U.S. INPUT, MSGR. DEWANE ARGUED THAT THE U.S., 
DESPITE EVIDENT SHORTCOMINGS, REPRESENTED AN OVERALL 
SUCCESS STORY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST RACISM THAT REMAINS A 
GLOBAL MODEL.  HE PLEDGED THAT IN DURBAN THE VATICAN WOULD 
WORK WITH THE USG FOR COMPROMISES IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE 
FINAL DOCUMENT. 
 
3.  (C) MSGR. DEWANE EXPRESSED UNDERSTANDING AND 
APPRECIATION FOR THE STAUNCH U.S. DEFENSE AT WCAR OF 
ISRAEL.  HOWEVER, WCAR, HE INSISTED, COULD NOT IGNORE THE 
FACT OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION WITHIN ISRAEL, ESPECIALLY 
GIVEN THE VOLATILE AND VIOLENT CLIMATE IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
THAT HAS FOLLOWED THE BREAKDOWN OF THE PEACE PROCESS.  A 
PALESTINIAN IN ISRAEL SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS 
AS AN ISRAELI, ACCORDING TO MSGR. DEWANE.  MSGR. DEWANE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04483  01 OF 02  281608Z 
SINGLED OUT CURTAILED OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR 
PALESTINIANS, WHO ARE SUBJECT TO CHECKS AND CONTROLS THAT 
HE LIKENED TO REPRESSIVE POLICE PRACTICES IN CHINA AND THE 
ERSTWHILE SOVIET UNION.  NONETHELESS, MSGR. DEWANE THOUGHT 
IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF WCAR BECAME A VEHICLE FOR ANTI- 
SEMITIC PREJUDICE AND ATTACKS ON ZIONISM.  THE VATICAN, HE 
NOTED, HAD REITERATED ITS CONDEMNATION OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN 
A PAMPHLET ON THE CHURCH AND RACISM, RE-RELEASED WITH A NEW 
INTRODUCTION LAST WEEK IN ADVANCE OF WCAR. 
 
4.  (C) CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAD RADICALLY ALTERED THE 
WCAR AGENDA, OFFERED MSGR. DEWANE.  ORIGINALLY, THE VATICAN 
ANTICIPATED ONLY A \"DEEP APOLOGY\" RATHER THAN \"REPARATIONS\" 
FROM DEVELOPED WESTERN NATIONS FOR THE ILLS OF COLNIALISM. 
MSGR. DEWANE COMMENTED THAT THE VATICANHAS LATELY 
DISCOVERED THE DIPLOMATIC VALUE OF ANAPOLOGY.  HOWEVER, 
THE VATICAN NOW FAVORS SOME FRM OF COMPENSATION RATHER 
THAN ONLY A COST-FREE EA CULPA.  DEBT RELIEF, IN 
PARTICULAR, REMAINED ACONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE, WITH WESTERN 
NATIONS, DEPITE SOME PROGRESS, STILL LARGELY SHIRKING 
THEIR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY. 
 
5.  (C) COMMENTING ON THE PREPCOM MEETINGS IN GENEVA, MSGR. 
DEWAYNE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AT THE TACTICS OF CERTAIN 
DELEGATIONS, WHO EXPLOITED WCAR TO DEFLECT ATTENTION FROM 
THEIR OWN DOMESTIC ABUSES AND HAD USED THE DELIBERATIONS TO 
TO WEAKEN OTHER U.N. DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS THE CONVENTION ON 
THE CHILD.  MSGR. DEWANE REPEATEDLY FINGERED THE PAKISTANI 
DELEGATION AS UNCOOPERATIVE, NONETHELESS CONCEDING ITS 
EFFECTIVENESS IN DIVERTING WCAR FROM THE MALTREATMENT OF 
CHRISTIANS IN PAKISTAN.  THE VATICAN, MSGR. DEWANE NOTED, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  04483  01 OF 02  281608Z 
HAD SUCCESSFULLY RETAINED LANGUAGE IN THE PREPCOM DOCUMENTS 
TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AGAINST DISCRIMINATION, 
DESPITE INITIAL OPPOSITION FROM EU NEGOTIATORS AS WELL AS 
THE PRC DELEGATION. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  MSGR. DEWANE LEFT A STRONG IMPRESSION OF 
VATICAN DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE OUTCOME OF WCAR.  WHILE 
VATICAN SYMPATHIES LIE STRONGLY WITH THE PALESTINIAN 
POPULATION WITHIN ISRAEL, THE HUE AND CRY AT WCAR OVER 
ZIONISM AS RACISM REPRESENTS A LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 
VATICAN TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE PLIGHT OF CHRISTIAN 
MINORITIES ELSEWHERE, WHO OFTEN ARE ALSO ETHNIC/RACIAL 
MINORITIES.  VATICAN AMBIVALENCE, HOWEVER, DOES NOT 
TRANSLATE INTO ALIGNMENT WITH U.S. INTERESTS.  YET THERE IS

2.   THE VATICAN HAS WARNED THAT GLOBALIZATION AND 
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THREATEN TO CREATE NEW FORMS OF 
RACISM AGAINST SOCIETY\'S WEAKEST MEMBERS, INCLUDING 
IMMIGRANTS, THE POOR AND THE UNBORN. THE COMMENTS CAME IN A 
NEW EDITION OF \"THE CHURCH AND RACISM,\" ISSUED BY THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE. FIRST PUBLISHED IN 
1988 AND REVISED AHEAD OF THE WCAR IN DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA, 
THE DOCUMENT INCLUDES THE ORIGINAL TEXT PLUS A NEW 15-PAGE 
INTRODUCTION. THE NEW TEXT SIGNALED THE VATICAN\'S 
DETERMINATION TO INCLUDE MIGRATION, POVERTY AND PRO-LIFE 
ISSUES IN ITS GAME-PLAN AT THE DURBAN CONFERENCE. IT ALSO 
CALLS FOR A MAJOR EDUCATION PROGRAM AGAINST RACISM AND 
INTOLERANCE AND GIVES QUALIFIED SUPPORT FOR AFFIRMATIVE 
ACTION PROGRAMS. THE VATICAN LINKS DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES 
TO ACCELERATING GLOBALIZATION WHICH HAS BROUGHT PROSPERITY 
TO SOME BUT CREATED CULTURAL DISINTEGRATION FOR OTHERS. 
ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN, THE RESULTING LACK OF IDENTITY 
LEADS TO A REJECTION OR FEAR OF FOREIGNERS.

3.   THE VATICAN DOCUMENT INDIRECTLY TOUCHED ON FINANCIAL 
COMPENSATION FOR DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES. IT SAID THAT FROM A 
LEGAL POINT OF VIEW ALL PERSONS HAVE THE RIGHT TO EQUITABLE 
REPARATION IF THEY HAVE PERSONALLY OR DIRECTLY SUFFERED 
MATERIAL OR MORAL INJURY, AND THAT IDEALLY REPARATION SHOULD 
ERASE ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE INJUSTICE. WHEN THAT IS 
NOT POSSIBLE, SOME FORM OF EQUIVALENT COMPENSATION SHOULD BE 
MADE, BUT THE DOCUMENT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS OFTEN 
DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE. THE DOCUMENT SAID THE PRINCIPLE OF 
REPARATION ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN 
NATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, \"THE OBLIGATION OF GIVING SUBSTANTIAL 
HELP TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.\"

4.   THE VATICAN\'S HEAD OF DELEGATION AT THE WCAR IN DURBAN, 
SOUTH AFRICA, ARCHBISHOP DIARMUID MARTIN, SAID AUGUST 28 
THAT NO ONE EQUATES ZIONISM WITH RACISM ANYMORE, IMPLYING 
THE NOTION WAS AN ANACHRONISM. (NOTE: MARTIN IS THE 
VATICAN\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER TO THE U.N. AGENCIES IN GENEVA. 
END NOTE). IN AN INTERVIEW WITH VATICAN NEWS AGENCY \"FIDES,\" 
THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THE DURBAN CONFERENCE MAY TRY TO ADDRESS 
THE QUESTION OF PALESTINIAN SUFFERING IN OTHER WAYS. THE 
SECRETARY (NUMBER 2) AT THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE 
 
SIPDIS 
AND PEACE, BISHOP GIAMPAOLO CREPALDI SAID AUGUST 30 THAT 
POLEMICAL EXCHANGES SURROUNDING THE U.N. CONFERENCE SHOULD 
NOT DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL NEED FOR BETTER

5.   THE VATICAN\'S TOP ECUMENICAL OFFICIAL, CARDINAL WALTER 
KASPER, HAS LAMENTED THE BREAKUP OF A CATHOLIC-JEWISH 
HISTORICAL COMMISSION STUDYING THE VATICAN\'S PUBLISHED WORLD 
WAR II DOCUMENTS AND BLAMED IT PARTLY OF JEWISH MEMBERS\' 
\"LEAKS AND POLEMICAL WRITINGS.\" KASPER, PRESIDENT OF THE 
VATICAN\'S COMMISSION FOR RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM, 
SAID HE WOULD WORK TO RE-LAUNCH THE JOINT RESEARCH \"ON NEW 
FOUNDATIONS.\" HE SAID SUCH HISTORICAL RESEARCH DEPENDED ON 
\"CORRECTNESS,\" RESPECT AND RECIPROCAL TRUST AMONG THE 
PROJECT\'S SCHOLARS. KASPER OPINED THAT THIS PRECONDITION HAD 
BEEN COMPLETELY LOST BECAUSE OF THE \"POLEMICS THAT AROSE 
AFTER THE SUSPENSION OF THE RESEARCH WORK AND THE OFFENSIVE 
SUSPICIONS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE SUSPENSION.\" THE CARDINAL 
REAFFIRMED THE VATICAN\'S POSITION THAT ITS ARCHIVES RELATING 
TO THE WORLD WAR II PERIOD WOULD BE OPEN TO SCHOLARS WHEN 
THEY HAD BEEN CATALOGUED AND CLASSIFIED. HE ALSO ADMITTED 
THAT REQUESTS FOR ACCESS BY JEWISH SCHOLARS ON THE DEFUNCT 
COMMISSION WERE \"UNDERSTANDABLE AND LEGITIMATE,\" AND THAT 
HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION WAS NECESSARY IN PROMOTING JEWISH-

6.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS NOMINATED FIVE AMERICAN PRELATES 
TO PARTICIPATE IN A SPECIAL MONTH-LONG VATICAN MEETING TO 
EXAMINE THE ROLE OF BISHOPS. THEY ARE CARDINAL EDWARD EGAN 
OF NEW YORK, CARDINAL EDMUND SZOKA, GOVERNOR OF VATICAN 
CITY, ARCHBISHOP JUSTIN REGALI OF ST. LOUIS, UKRAINIAN RITE 
ARCHBISHOP STEFAN SOROKA OF PHILADELPHIA, AND AUXILIARY 
BISHOP ROBERT MAGINNIS OF PHILADELPHIA. THE PAPAL NOMINEES 
WILL JOIN BISHOPS ELECTED DIRECTLY BY THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCAL 
\"CONFERENCES\" TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING. THE PAPAL 
NOMINEES ARE PICKED FOR THEIR PARTICULAR THEOLOGICAL 
EXPERTISE AND FOR THEIR PROVEN LOYALTY TO THE HOLY SEE. IN 
ADDITION TO INTERNAL CHURCH MATTERS, THE BISHOPS MEETING 
WILL ALSO ADDRESS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES SUCH AS 
GLOBALIZATION, ECOLOGY, MIGRATION, LABOR RIGHTS AND THE 
EXPLOITATION OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THE OUTCOME OF THESE 
INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS OF BISHOPS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE

CELIBACY DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO MARRY. APPARENTLY SUNG HAS 
ACCEPTED MILINGO\'S POSITION AND ENDED HER TWO-WEEK HUNGER 
STRIKE. (COMMENT: WHILE MUCH OF THE MILINGO-SUNG STORY WAS 
THE RESULT OF JOURNALISTIC FANTASY COMBINED WITH A SUMMER 
DEARTH OF NEWS, THE VATICAN WAS APPARENTLY CONCERNED ABOUT A 
POSSIBLE SCHISM CRISIS WITH MILINGO LEAVING THE FOLD TO 
FOUND A CHURCH AIMED AT ATTRACTING ADHERENTS IN AFRICA, LED 
BY BISHOPS AND PRIESTS VALIDITY ORDAINED BY MILINGO, AND 
FUNDED BY THE REVEREND SUN MYUNG MOON. THE VATICAN REGARDS 
MOON AND HIS FOLLOWERS AS ANOTHER RELIGION TOTALLY DIVORCED 
FROM CHRISTIANITY, AND NOT AS A SECT. A SENIOR OFFICIAL SAID 
THE VATICAN HAS NO DESIRE TO ENTER INTO DIALOGUE WITH THE 
GROUP \"BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY AMBIGUITIES.\" END 
COMMENT). NICHOLSON

APPRECIATED, AS ARE THE VIEWS OF THE PRESIDENT ON AN ISSUE 
OF IMMENSE IMPORTANCE TO THE VATICAN, THE VALUE OF HUMAN

ADDED THAT HE RECENTLY MET WITH 1992 FELLOW COUP PLOTTER

SAID CHAVEZ\' POPULARITY IS ALREADY SLIPPING.  IN MEXICO,

1.   POPE JOHN PAUL II CONDEMNED THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST 
ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. TARGETS USING SOME OF THE STRONGEST 
LANGUAGE EVER HEARD BY POST STAFF. IN HIS SEPTEMBER 12 
GENERAL AUDIENCE IN VATICAN CITY, THE POPE, BREAKING WITH 
TRADITION, SPOKE SOLELY IN ENGLISH AND ITALIAN. THE USUALLY 
FESTIVE OCCASION OF THOUSANDS OF PILGRIMS AND TOURISTS 
CHANTING AND WAVING NATIONAL FLAG WAS TURNED INTO A SOLEMN 
MOMENT OF REFLECTION AND SOLIDARITY WITH THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
 
2.   VATICAN TRANSLATION OF POPE\'S REMARKS IN ITALIAN 
FOLLOWS. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
I CANNOT BEGIN THIS AUDIENCE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY PROFOUND 
SORROW AT THE TERRORIST ATTACKS WHICH YESTERDAY BROUGHT 
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TO AMERICA, CAUSING THOUSANDS OF 
VICTIMS AND INJURING COUNTLESS PEOPLE. TO THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND TO ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS I EXPRESS MY 
HEARTFELT SORROW. IN THE FACE OF SUCH UNSPEAKABLE HORROR WE 
CANNOT BUT BE DEEPLY DISTURBED. I ADD MY VOICE TO ALL THE 
VOICES RAISED IN THESE HOURS TO EXPRESS INDIGNANT 
CONDEMNATION, AND I STRONGLY REITERATE THAT THE WAYS OF 
VIOLENCE WILL NEVER LEAD TO GENUINE SOLUTIONS TO HUMANITY\'S 
PROBLEMS. YESTERDAY WAS A DARK DAY IN THE HISTORY OF 
HUMANITY, A TERRIBLE AFFRONT TO HUMAN DIGNITY. AFTER 
RECEIVING THE NEWS, I FOLLOWED WITH INTENSE CONCERN THE 
DEVELOPING SITUATION, WITH HEARTFELT PRAYERS TO THE LORD. 
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO COMMIT ACTS OF SUCH SAVAGE CRUELTY? 
THE HUMAN HEART HAS DEPTHS FROM WHICH SCHEMES OF UNHEARD-OF 
FEROCITY SOMETIMES EMERGE, CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IN A MOMENT 
THE NORMAL DAILY LIFE OF A PEOPLE. BUT FAITH COMES TO OUR 
AID AT THESE TIMES WHEN WORDS SEEM TO FAIL. CHRIST\'S WORD IS 
THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN GIVE A RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS WHICH 
TROUBLE OUR SPIRIT. EVEN IF THE FORCES OF DARKNESS APPEAR TO 
PREVAIL, THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD KNOW THAT EVIL AND DEATH 
DO NOT HAVE THE FINAL SAY. CHRISTIAN HOPE IS BASED ON THIS 
TRUTH; AT THIS TIME OUR PRAYERFUL TRUST DRAWS STRENGTH FROM 
IT. WITH DEEPLY FELT SYMPATHY I ADDRESS MYSELF TO THE 
BELOVED PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THIS MOMENT OF 
DISTRESS AND CONSTERNATION, WHEN THE COURAGE OF SO MANY MEN 
AND WOMEN OF GOOD WILL IS BEING SORELY TESTED. IN A SPECIAL 
WAY I REACH OUT TO THE FAMILIES OF THE DEAD AND THE INJURED, 
AND ASSURE THEM OF MY SPIRITUAL CLOSENESS. I ENTRUST TO THE 
MERCY OF THE MOST HIGH THE HELPLESS VICTIMS OF THIS TRAGEDY, 
FOR WHOM I OFFERED MASS THIS MORNING, INVOKING UPON THEM 
ETERNAL REST. MAY GOD GIVE COURAGE TO THE SURVIVORS; MAY HE 
SUSTAIN THE RESCUE-WORKERS AND THE MANY VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE 
PRESENTLY MAKING AN ENORMOUS EFFORT TO COPE WITH SUCH AN 
IMMENSE EMERGENCY. I ASK YOU, DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS, TO 
JOIN ME IN PRAYER FOR THEM. LET US BEG THE LORD THAT THE 
SPIRAL OF HATRED AND VIOLENCE WILL NOT PREVAIL. MAY THE 
BLESSED VIRGIN, MOTHER OF MERCY, FILL THE HEARTS OF ALL WITH 
WISE THOUGHTS AND PEACEFUL INTENTIONS. TODAY, MY HEARTFELT 
SYMPATHY IS WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SUBJECTED YESTERDAY TO 
INHUMAN TERRORIST ATTACKS WHICH HAVE TAKEN THE LIVES OF 
THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT HUMAN BEINGS AND CAUSED UNSPEAKABLE 
SORROW IN THE HEARTS OF ALL MEN AND WOMEN OF GOOD WILL. 
YESTERDAY WAS INDEED A DARK DAY IN OUR HISTORY, AN APPALLING 
OFFENCE AGAINST PEACE, A TERRIBLE ASSAULT AGAINST HUMAN 
DIGNITY. I INVITE YOU ALL TO JOIN ME IN COMMENDING THE 
VICTIMS OF THIS SHOCKING TRAGEDY TO ALMIGHTY GOD\' S ETERNAL 
LOVE. LET US IMPLORE HIS COMFORT UPON THE INJURED, THE 
FAMILIES INVOLVED, ALL WHO ARE DOING THEIR UTMOST TO RESCUE 
SURVIVORS AND HELP THOSE AFFECTED. I ASK GOD TO GRANT THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE THEY NEED AT THIS 
TIME OF SORROW AND TRIAL. 
END TEXT. 
 
3.   COMMENT: THE TONE OF THE POPE\'S REMARKS AND THE 
MODIFIED GENERAL AUDIENCE INDICATE THE SERIOUSNESS WITH 
WHICH THE VATICAN TAKES THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM AND ITS 
ESTEEM FOR THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. THE ATTACKS ON NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON RECEIVED 
BANNER HEADLINES IN THE SEPTEMBER 12 EDITION OF THE 
VATICAN\'S DAILY NEWSPAPER, L\'OSSERVATORE ROMANO. AMBASSADOR 
NICHOLSON WILL RESPOND PERSONALLY TO THE PAPAL EXPRESSION OF 
SOLIDARITY SEPTEMBER 13 WHEN HE PRESENTS HIS CREDENTIALS TO

ITS APPLICATION TO RECENT CONFLICTS. 
 
2.   (U) SEVERAL OPINIONS ON ITS APPLICATION TO THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES HAVE 
EMERGED FROM SENIOR VATICAN CIRCLES IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. 
PAPAL SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS MADE INTERNATIONAL 
HEADLINES WHEN HE SEEMED TO DECLARE \"AGGRESSIVE\" MEANS AS 
JUSTIFIABLE SELF-DEFENSE. NAVARRO-VALLS LATER ISSUED A 
CLARIFICATION SAYING HE WAS MERELY STATING STANDARD VATICAN 
DOCTRINE. WHILE POPE JOHN PAUL II CONTINUES TO CALL FOR 
DIALOGUE AND PROMOTES PEACEFUL METHODS OF CONFLICT 
RESOLUTION, SOME OF HIS SENIOR ADVISORS HAVE TAKEN A FIRMER 
POSITION. ECUMENICAL DIALOGUE CHIEF CARDINAL WALTER KASPER 
SAID SEPTEMBER 25 THAT \"IT WAS NECESSARY TO BLOCK THE 
TERRORISTS SO THEY CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THEIR CRIMES.\" 
KASPER ADDED THAT INTERVENTION WAS \"NECESSARY, OTHERWISE WE 
ALL BECOME HOSTAGES.\"  NUMBER THREE IN THE VATICAN 
GOVERNMENT HIERARCHY, ARCHBISHOP LEONARDO SANDRI, DESCRIBED 
TERRORISM AS A THREAT TO ALL PEOPLE, NOT JUST TO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
 
3. (C) THE BOUNDARIES OF THE VATICAN\'S JUST WAR THEORY ARE 
SOMEWHAT BLURRED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE WAR ON 
TERRORISM. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR A MILITARY RESPONSE VARY 
FROM THEOLOGIAN TO THEOLOGIAN EVEN WITHIN THE VATICAN 
GOVERNMENT. NO ONE IN THE VATICAN IS LIKELY TO PUBLICLY 
CONDONE MILITARY ACTION. THE EMPHASIS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE 
POPE, WILL ALWAYS BE ON PEACEFUL MEANS NO MATTER HOW 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, SOME LIMITED AND PRECISE 
FORM OF MILITARY RESPONSE THAT ALSO SAFEGUARDS THE INNOCENT 
WILL BE \"UNDERSTOOD\" BY THE VATICAN EVEN IF NOT OPENLY 
SANCTIONED. 
 
4. (C) HOWEVER, UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR POSSIBLE U.S. 
MILITARY ACTION IS NOT UNANIMOUS IN THE VATICAN AND WOULD 
NOT BE.  EMBASSY HAS LEARNED THAT DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
(WHO IS NOTED FOR HIS PRO AMERICAN POSITIONS) HAS SAID 
PRIVATELY THAT NAVARRO-VALLES WENT \"TOO FAR\" IN HIS 
STATEMENTS.  YET, FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN IN PRIVATE 
CONVERSATION WITH AMBASSADOR RECENTLY HAS IMPLIED A 
RESIGNATION THAT HE BELIEVES THE U.S. WILL BE TAKING 
MILITARY ACTION SOON.  ALTHOUGH MOST MEMBERS OF THE VATICAN 
FOREIGN MINISTRY WOULD BE PERSONALLY SUPPORTIVE OF 
AGGRESSIVE RETALIATION, OFFICIAL VATICAN POSITIONS WILL BE 
BASED ON VATICAN GEO-POLITICAL CONCERNS.  IN THIS SPECIFIC 
CONFLICT, IRAQ IS FOREMOST IN THEIR CALCULATIONS.  ANY 
RETALIATION WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE IRAQ WOULD LESSEN THE 
VATICAN\'S POSITIVE NEUTRALITY.  THE VATICAN IS FIRMLY 
CONVINCED THAT ANY REGIME WHICH REPLACES THE CURRENT ONE 
WILL NOT BE AS SUPPORTIVE OF THE LARGE IRAQI CATHOLIC 
POPULATION.  IN ADDITION, EVEN IF POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION 
IS DIRECTED ONLY AGAINST AFGHANISTAN, THE VATICAN IS GREATLY 
CONCERNED WITH A BACKLASH AGAINST CATHOLICS (AND OTHER 
CHRISTIANS) LIVING IN EGYPT, SYRIA, IRAQ, PALESTINIAN 
TERRITORIES, AND LEBANON. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: THE VATICAN\'S POSITION ON THE USE OF FORCE 
IN RETALIATION WILL BE CRITICAL IN BUILDING WORLDWIDE PUBLIC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUPPORT.  POST REQUESTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT REMAIN SENSITIVE 
TO THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THE VATICAN INFORMED IN ORDER 
TO AVOID ANY SURPRISES AND THUS HARMFUL STATEMENTS ON THE 
PART OF VATICAN OFFICIALS.  A PHONE CALL BY SECRETARY POWELL 
TO VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN BEFORE THE UNDERTAKING OF 
ANY MILITARY ACTION WOULD HELP IN FIRMING UP VATICAN 
SUPPORT.

GEOPOLITICAL/RELIGIOUS MANEUVERING 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR R. JAMES NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 
(A) AND (D).

                       CONFIDENTIAL

POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S SEPTEMBER 22-27 TRIP TO KAZAKHSTAN AND 
ARMENIA AS SUCCESSFUL. THE VATICAN HAD THREE OBJECTIVES FOR 
THIS TRIP: 1) CONTINUE THE PRESSURE ON THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX 
CHURCH TO ALLOW A VISIT TO MOSCOW; 2) BOLSTER THE \"MODERATE 
ISLAMIC\" GOVERNMENT IN KAZAKHSTAN AND HOLD IT UP AS AN 
EXAMPLE; 3) INCREMENTALLY MOVE FORWARD THE DIALOG BETWEEN 
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH 
WHICH THE POPE HOPES WILL LEAD TO REUNIFICATION.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
2.(C) EMBASSY OFFICERS MET WITH SEVERAL VATICAN OFFICIALS 
AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC OBSERVERS IN WAKE OF POPE JOHN PAUL 
II\'S VISIT TO KAZAKHSTAN AND ARMENIA SEPTEMBER 22-27. 
VATICAN DIRECTOR FOR RUSSIA AND THE FORMER STATES OF THE 
SOVIET UNION, ARCHBISHOP TRICARICO TOLD DCM THAT THE VISIT 
WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN FURTHER ISOLATING RUSSIAN ORTHODOX 
PATRIARCH ALEXI AND MAINTAINING PRESSURE TO PERMIT A VISIT 
TO MOSCOW IN THE RELATIVELY NEAR FUTURE.  TRICARICO SAID 
THAT WITH THE VISIT TO KAZAKHSTAN, THE ANNOUNCED 2002 VISIT 
TO BULGARIA, AND PROBABLE VISIT TO BELARUS, THE POPE WILL 
HAVE \"SURROUNDED\" ALEXI.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE POPE WILL 
HAVE SHOWN ALEXI THAT RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CLAIMS OF 
TERRITORIAL-CANONICAL PREROGATIVES ARE MEANINGLESS IN THE 
MODERN WORLD.  IRONICALLY, ON OCTOBER 2, RUSSIAN EMBASSY TO 
THE VATICAN DCM, DMITRI SHTODIN SECONDED THIS VIEW TO DCM. 
SHTODIN SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS PUTTING \"PRESSURE\" ON 
ALEXI TO INVITE THE POPE TO MOSCOW.  HE NOTED THE RELATIVELY 
MODERATE STATEMENTS OF THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX\'S CHURCH 
\"MINISTER FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS\" KYRIL CONCERNING THE POPE 
VISIT TO KAZAKHSTAN AS AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
HAVING AN INFLUENCE.  (NOTE: THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH DID 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05288  01 OF 03  111456Z 
NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE POPE\'S VISIT TO ARMENIA AS THE 
ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH IS NOT IN COMMUNION WITH THE 
ORTHODOX CHURCH AND MOSCOW HAS NEVER CONSIDERED ARMENIA AS 
BEING IN ITS CANONICAL TERRITORY). TRICARICO SAID THE POPE 
DID NOT RAISE NAGORO/KARABACH WHILE IN YERAVAN.  HOWEVER, 
WHEN DCM POSED THE SAME QUESTION TO RUSSIAN DCM SHTODIN THE 
REPLY WAS THAT HE HAD SEEN A REPORTING CABLE WHICH STATED 
THE ISSUE WAS DISCUSSED WITH THE ARMENIAN PRESIDENT. 
 
3.(C) VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER MIGLIORE (SEPTEL), 
TOLD POLOFF AND DCM THAT THE VATICAN IS CONVINCED THAT THE 
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX ARE FEELING THE PRESSURE, AND THAT A TRIP 
TO MOSCOW IS NO LONGER AN UNREACHABLE GOAL.  DCM ALSO MET 
WITH FATHER GIOVANNI MATERA, THE RECTOR OF THE BASILICA OF 
SAINT NICOLAS IN BARI, ON OCTOBER 8.  ALTHOUGH A ROMAN 
CATHOLIC CHURCH, BARI AND THE CHURCH ARE THE CENTER OF 
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH\'S OFFICIAL REPRESENTATION TO ITALY 
(HAVING REJECTED ROME BECAUSE OF THE POPE\'S PRESENCE). 
FATHER GIOVANNI SAID THAT THERE WILL BE A CATHOLIC/ORTHODOX 
MEETING HOSTED BY THE BASILICA ON NOVEMBER 25 WHICH 
METROPOLITAN KYRIL IS EXPECTED TO ATTEND; THE QUESTION OF 
THE POPE\'S VISIT TO MOSCOW IS ON THE AGENDA. 
 
4.(C) COMMENT: IN ADDITION TO FURTHER ISOLATING PATRIARCH 
ALEXI, THE VISIT TO KAZAKHSTAN WAS DESIGNED TO EXTOL 
RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IN A PROMINENTLY MUSLIM COUNTRY. 
KAZAKHSTAN IS THE FIRST MUSLIM COUNTRY WHICH HAS CONCLUDED A 
CONCORDAT (EG. A TREATY REGULATING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH) WITH THE VATICAN.  THE VISIT TO 
KAZAKHSTAN IS PART OF THE VATICAN\'S AGENDA FOR THE POPE TO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05288  01 OF 03  111456Z 
VISIT MODERATE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES TO BOLSTER THEIR POPULARITY 
IN THE FACE OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM. 
 
5.(C) COMMENT CONT\'D: THE MAIN THRUST OF THE VISIT TO 
ARMENIA WAS TO FURTHER THE PROCESS OF DIALOG BETWEEN THE 
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE APOSTOLIC CATHOLIC CHURCH.  A 
SIDE BENEFIT WAS THE FACT THAT ARMENIA, BEING ANOTHER FORMER 
SOVIET REPUBLIC, WAS AN ADDITIONAL BLATANT REMINDER OF THE 
MOSCOW PATRIARCH\'S OBSTINACY.  THEOLOGICALLY, THE ROMAN 
CHURCH AND THE ARMENIAN CHURCH HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN 
ELIMINATING THEIR DIFFERENCES.  THE REMAINING PROBLEMS 
INCLUDE THE ROLE OF THE POPE, AS WELL AS THE ARMENIAN 
CHURCH\'S COMMUNION WITH THE COPTIC CHURCH WHICH WANTS TO GO 
MUCH MORE SLOWLY ON ANY DISCUSSIONS ON REUNIFICATION WITH 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

2.  (C) SUMMARY: SENIOR ADVISOR AND AFGHANISTAN COORDINATOR 
JOINED AMBASSADOR TO BRIEF VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
10/20 ON U.S. EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN.  DFM NOTED THE 
VATICAN WAS ARRANGING A 10/28-10/29 INTERFAITH MEETING IN 
CAIRO OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS THAT WOULD ALSO ADDRESS 9/11 AND 
ITS AFTERMATH.  DFM SKETCHED VARIOUS VATICAN CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN AID TO AFGHAN REFUGEES.  DFM 
INDICATED THERE ARE TWO OR THREE NUNS CURRENTLY WORKING IN 
A KABUL HOSPITAL.  DFM EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE KASHMIR 
SITUATION AND AFGHAN MILITARY CAMPAIGN COULD DESTABILIZE 
THE GOP, WITH REPERCUSSIONS FOR PAKISTAN\'S SIZEABLE 
CATHOLIC MINORITY. END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C) SENIOR ADVISOR AND AFGHANISTAN COORDINATOR JEFFREY 
J. LUNSTEAD AND AMBASSADOR BRIEFED VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY 
OFFICIALS 10/20 ON U.S. EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN. THE 
AMBASSADOR AND LUNSTEAD SAW MONSIGNOR CELESTINO MIGLIORE, 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER-EQUIVALENT, AND EAST ASIA AND 
AFGHANISTAN DESK OFFICER MONSIGNOR LUIS MARRANO DE 
MONTEMAYOR; AFGHAN DESK OFFICER GEETA PASI AND EMBOFF ALSO 
ATTENDED. 
 
4.  (C) DFM MIGLIORE SPOKE POSITIVELY OF THE CIRCUMSPECTION 
EVIDENT IN THE U.S. RESPONSE, THOUGH HE NOTED THAT THE HOLY 
SEE COULD NEVER APPLAUD WARFARE.  WITHIN INTERNATIONAL 
BODIES, SUCH AS THE U.N., THE HOLY SEE WOULD SUPPORT 
FURTHER POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL INITIATIVES.  WHERE THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05546  01 OF 02  251050Z 
HOLY SEE COULD PLAY A DIRECT LEADERSHIP ROLE WAS IN 
CULTURAL AFFAIRS, SPECIFICALLY THROUGH INTER-RELIGIOUS 
DIALOGUE, MIGLIORE SAID.  HE INDICATED THAT THE 
CONGREGATION FOR RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE, AN INSTITUTIONAL ARM 
OF THE VATICAN, WAS ORGANIZING A MEETING OF ISLAMIC AND 
CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS AT EL HAZARA UNIVERSITY IN 
CAIRO. 
 
5.  (C) MIGLIORE SHARED CONCERNS THAT THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN 
WAS OUTSTRIPPING POLITICAL STRATEGIES.  HE OBSERVED THAT 
NEIGHBORING NATIONS IN FACT SHARED FEW COMMON INTERESTS, AN 
IMPEDIMENT TO ANY TRUE REGIONAL COALITION.  ADDRESSING THE 
HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY, MIGLIORE VOLUNTEERED THAT IT 
PREDATED THE PRESENT MILITARY CAMPAIGN.  WINTERTIME, HE 
ADDED, WOULD SEE A DRAMATIC WORSENING.  THE VATICAN IS 
CONTRIBUTING AND COORDINATING SOME RELIEF ASSISTANCE, 
THROUGH CARITAS AND COR UNUM (LOOSELY, VATICAN EQUIVALENTS 
TO USAID).  CARITAS, HE SAID, HAS AN INFORMAL PRESENCE IN 
TEHERAN.  ALSO, THE SOVEREIGN MILITARY ORDER OF THE KNIGHTS 
OF MALTA (SMOM) IS SET TO INITIATE HUMANITARIAN WORK IN 
IRAN.  SUCH EFFORTS CONSTITUTE EMERGENCY AID ONLY, MIGLIORE 
SAID; A FINAL POLITICAL SOLUTION IS IMPERATIVE.  MOREOVER, 
HE DREADED GLOBAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSE SHOULD THE MILITARY 
CAMPAIGN EXTEND TO IRAQ. 
 
6.  (C) LUNSTEAD SOUGHT INFORMATION ON VATICAN 
PERSONNEL/ECCLESIASTICS STILL IN AFGHANISTAN.  MONTEMAYOR 
STATED THERE WERE THREE NUNS BEFORE MIGLIORE CORRECTED HIM 
THAT ONLY TWO REMAIN, THE THIRD HAVING LEFT FOR FRANCE ON 
MEDICAL GROUNDS.  THE VATICAN HAS NO EASY MEANS TO CONTACT 
THE NUNS, MONTEMAYOR CLAIMED.  THEY WERE FOREIGN NATIONALS, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05546  01 OF 02  251050Z 
LONG RESIDENT IN AFGHANISTAN, AND CURRENTLY WORKING IN THE 
INDIRA GANDHI HOSPITAL IN KABUL.  (COMMENT:  MONTEMAYOR 
LATER PHONED EMBOFF TO RELATE THERE ARE INDEED THREE NUNS 
IN KABUL, AFFILIATED WITH INDIRA GANDHI AND A CLINIC BY THE 
NAME OF ALI ABAD.  THE NUNS ARE MEMBERS OF THE LITTLE 
SISTERS OF JESUS. THE VATICAN REQUESTED WE NOT PUBLICIZE 
THEIR PRESENCE IN KABUL.) 
 
7.  (C) MIGLIORE ASKED LUNSTEAD\'S THINKING ON KASHMIR. 
LUNSTEAD CONCEDED THE PROBLEM WAS GRAVE; CERTAIN TERRORISTS 
IN KASHMIR HAD RECEIVED TRAINING IN PAKISTAN AND IN EL 
QAEDA CAMPS.  THE SECRETARY, HE NOTED, HAD CONDEMNED ALL 
TERRORISM, INCLUDING ACTS AGAINST INDIA.  GENERAL 
MUSHARRAFF, HE SUGGESTED, NOW HAD A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO 
BRING STABILITY TO THE SITUATION. 
 
8.   (C) MIGLIORE REQUESTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HUMANITARIAN CAMPAIGN.  LUNDSTEAD 
CONCEDED THERE WERE SEVERE PROBLEMS.  THE SEPTEMBER 
DEPARTURE OF NON-AFGHAN AID WORKERS CAPABLE OF MANAGING 
SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION WAS A COMPLICATING FACTOR. 
MOREOVER, RECENT TALIBAN ACTIONS -- SEIZING WAREHOUSES AND 
BEATING AFGHAN AID WORKERS -- WAS DEEPLY DISTURBING.  THE 
TALIBAN\'S LONGSTANDING LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE AFGHAN 
POPULATION WAS SIGNIFICANT, HE ADDED, WITH THE OUTSIDE

NEW REFUGEE SITES, IF NEEDED, LUNDSTEAD SAID.  THUS FAR, 
THE FLOW OF NEW REFUGEES HAS REMAINED LOW. 
 
9.   (C) LUNSTEAD, AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S ENCOURAGEMENT, 
REMARKED BRIEFLY ON HIS 10/19 ENCOUNTER WITH THE KING.  HE 
DESCRIBED THE KING AS PHYSICALLY FRAIL YET NOT IMMOBILE, 
AND AS MENTALLY ACUTE, WITH NO DESIRE TO RETURN TO RULE IN 
AFGHANISTAN, JUST AN EXILE\'S HOPE FOR BURIAL IN HIS 
HOMELAND.  HIS ENTOURAGE WAS HAMPERED BY INTRIGUE, LUNSTEAD 
ADDED. ASKED BY MIGLIORE IF THE KING WERE WILLING TO ASSUME 
LEADERSHIP, LUNDSTEAD ANSWERED THAT THE KING KNEW HE WOULD 
NEVER RULE AGAIN.  HE WAS AN OLD MAN, WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT 
SECURITY THREATS THAT KEPT HIM FROM HIS DAILY GARDEN 
STROLL.  THE U.S. HARBORED NO ILLUSIONS, LUNSTEAD SAID, 
ADDING THE KING\'S ENTOURAGE HAD BEEN IRRESOLUTE IN THE 
PAST. 
 
10.  (C) ASKED TO EXPAND ON THE AFOREMENTIONED CAIRO 
ENCOUNTER, MIGLIORE STIPULATED THE 10/28-10/29 AL HEZAR 
MEETING WOULD BE AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION AND WOULD RESPOND 
TO SEPTEMBER 11 AND ITS AFTERMATH.  MIGLIORE EMPHASIZED 
THAT THE HOLY SEE IS A SPIRITUAL, ETHICAL AND MORAL ENTITY, 
WHOSE MISSION IS NOT POLITICAL BUT RELIGIOUS.  THE MASSES 
IN ISLAMIC SOCIETIES, HE OBSERVED, DEPEND ON RELIGIOUS 
LEADERSHIP; IF RELIGIOUS LEADERS WILL NOT DISTANCE 
THEMSELVES FROM VIOLENCE, THEN NEITHER WILL THE POPULATION 
AT LARGE.  MIGLIORE SUGGESTED THE HOLY SEE CAN PLAY A ROLE 
TO CONVINCE RELIGIOUS COUNTERPARTS TO REPUDIATE VIOLENCE. 
MIGLIORE LEVIED FAINT PRAISE AT A SIMILAR EFFORT HELD BY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SANT\'EGIDIO 10/3-10/4 IN ROME. (COMMENT:  SANT\'EGIDIO IS A 
PROMINENT ROME-BASED CATHOLIC NGO FAMED FOR CONFLICT 
RESOLUTION, NOTABLY THE PEACEFUL END TO THE MOZAMBIQUE 
CIVIL WAR BROKERED IN 1993.)  MIGLIORE LAUDED SANT\'EGIDIO\'S 
ABILITY TO GATHER ISLAMIC LEADERS QUICKLY, YET HE 
QUESTIONED THE VALUE OF A GET-TOGETHER THAT DID NOT PRODUCE 
A PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE, NOT JUST A DOCUMENT 
SIGNED IN ENGLISH THAT WOULD NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY IN 
PARTICIPANT\'S HOME COUNTRIES.  MAYBE FUTURE SANT\'EGIDIO 
MEETINGS WOULD BE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE, MIGLIORE MUSED. 
 
11.  (C) LUNSTEAD DECRIED RHETORIC OF A CLASH OF 
CIVILIZATIONS. IF THE WEST IS SEEN AS ISLAM\'S ENEMY, THE 
CONSEQUENCES WILL BE CATASTROPHIC.  THIS IS A FURTHER 
REASON FOR SWIFT CONCLUSION TO THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN, AS 
GENERAL MUSHARRAFF HAS PLEADED, VOICING HIS POPULATION\'S 
ANGER AT THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN.  MONTEMAYOR REMARKED 
CATHOLIC LEADERSHIP LIKEWISE ABHORS THE BOMBING; IMAGES OF 
CONTINUAL BOMBARDMENT AND CIVILIAN INJURIES DETRACT FROM 
THE UNIFIED EFFORT TO COMBAT TERRORISM.  MIGLIORE WORRIED 
FURTHER AT THE RISK TO PAKISTAN\'S STABILITY AND TO ITS ONE 
MILLION-STRONG CATHOLIC POPULATION. LUNDSTEAD HOWEVER 
VOICED CONFIDENCE IN GENERAL MUSHARRAFF, PRAISING HIS SWIFT 
REPUDIATION OF THE TALIBAN, A TURNAROUND THAT RAISES HOPES 
MUSHARRAFF WILL NOW ALSO FACE DOWN RADICAL ISLAM WITHIN 
PAKISTAN, THEREBY ALSO BETTERING CONDITIONS FOR PAKISTAN\'S 
RELIGIOUS MINORITIES.

2.   POPE JOHN PAUL II DEPLORED THE CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN 
ISRAELI TROOPS AND PALESTINIANS IN THE WEST BANK TOWNS OF 
BETHLEHEM, BEIT JALA AND BEIT SAHOUR. IN AN OCTOBER 21 ADDRESS 
IN VATICAN CITY, HE SAID THE VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS A 
\"PATH OF DEATH, WHICH DISHONORS GOD\'S NAME.\" THE POPE 
EXPRESSED PARTICULAR CONCERN THAT \"WAR AND DEATH HAVE EVEN 
ARRIVED AT THE SQUARE OF THE BASILICA OF THE NATIVITY OF OUR 
LORD.\" THE POPE SAID IT MUST BE \"EVERYONE\'S COMMITMENT TO MAKE 
THIS (THE HOLY LAND) FINALLY A LAND OF PEACE AND FRATERNITY.\"

3.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS ISSUED AN APOLOGY TO CHINA FOR ANY

ROME, ITALY MARKING FOUR CENTURIES SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF JESUIT

PAGE 03        VATICA  05566  01 OF 02  261515Z 
MISSIONARY MATTEO RICCI IN BEIJING. THE POPE WROTE THAT 
PERSONAL LIMITATIONS, POLITICAL PRESSURE AND THEOLOGICAL 
DISPUTES SOMETIMES LED TO TENSIONS AND MISTRUST BETWEEN CHINA 
AND THE VATICAN. THE POPE OPINED THAT SUCH MISTRUST OFFSET THE 
\"GOOD WORK\" ACCOMPLISHED BY MISSIONARIES IN PREACHING THE 
CHRISTIAN MESSAGE, EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. POPE JOHN PAUL 
EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT \"CONCRETE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION AND 
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND THE PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC OF 
CHINA MAY SOON BE ESTABLISHED.\" (NOTE: THE VATICAN HAS 
REPEATEDLY SAID IT WOULD MOVE ITS DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION 
\"OVERNIGHT\" FROM TAIPEI TO BEIJING AS SOON AS CHINA AGREES TO 
NORMALIZE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  AT ISSUE IS THE VATICAN\'S 
RELIGIOUS JURISDICTION OVER THE 10-15 MILLION CATHOLICS IN 
CHINA, INCLUDING THE VATICAN\'S RIGHT TO ORDAIN BISHOPS FREE 
FROM STATE INTERFERENCE.  END NOTE.) THE POPE SAID, \"THE 
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE HOLY SEE 
WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE POSITIVE REPERCUSSIONS FOR HUMANITY\'S 
PROGRESS.\" TAIWAN\'S AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE EXPRESSED DOUBT 
THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WOULD RESPOND FAVORABLY TO THE 
POPE\'S OVERTURE TO BEIJING, WHICH HE DEFINED AS \"EXCEPTIONAL.\" 
(SEPTEL TO FOLLOW).

CARITAS LAUNCHES APPEAL FOR AFGHAN REFUGEES

4.   CARITAS INTERNATIONAL, THE CONFEDERATION OF CATHOLIC 
RELIEF AGENCIES, HAS LAUNCHED AN APPEAL FOR US DOLLARS 11 
MILLION TO FUND ITS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR AFGHAN REFUGEES. 
CARITAS SAID THE MONEY WOULD BE USED TO CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE FLED THEIR HOMES SINCE THE START OF THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN

IN AFGHANISTAN, AS WELL AS THOSE ALREADY IN CAMPS IN PAKISTAN. 
CARITAS SAID THE MILITARY ACTION WAS COMPOUNDING AN ALREADY 
SERIOUS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN, WHICH HAS SUFFERED 
THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT AND 22 YEARS OF WAR. 
MEANWHILE, THE VATICAN\'S OBSERVER TO THE U.N. AGENCIES IN 
GENEVA, ARCHBISHOP DIARMUID MARTIN HIGHLIGHTED THE FORCED 
DISPLACEMENT OF LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE, SUCH AS THE AFGHAN 
PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR HOMES TO AVOID THE CURRENT MILITARY 
ACTION. ADDRESSING A MEETING OF UNHCR, THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THE 
LACK OF PROTECTION FOR REFUGEES IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY 
CRITICAL INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM.

1.(U) SENATOR, I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR 
APPOINTMENT  AS THE PRESIDENT\'S SPECIAL ENVOY FOR PEACE IN 
SUDAN.  THE DIFFICULT SITUATION IN THAT COUNTRY IS ONE OF 
THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES FOR THE VATICAN ON THE AFRICAN 
CONTINENT.

2.(SBU) BECAUSE OF THE VATICAN\'S DEEP INTEREST IN THE 
CONFLICT IN SUDAN, I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO PAY A 
VISIT DURING YOUR UPCOMING TRAVEL TO DISCUSS THE 
SITUATION WITH THE VATICAN\'S FOREIGN MINISTER ARCHBISHOP 
TAURAN.  THE SUDAN IS AN AREA IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES 
AND THE VATICAN SHARE MUTUAL CONCERNS AND OBJECTIVESNLS. 
 
3.(C) MY EMBASSY HAS ENGAGED THE VATICAN ON THE SUDAN 
ISSUE OVER THE LAST YEAR.  IN 2000, FOR INSTANCE, WHEN 
SUDAN WAS A CANDIDATE FOR A UN SECURITY COUNCIL SEAT, 
EMBASSY VATICAN APPROACHED THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
AND ASKED HIM TO USE THE VATICAN\'S INFLUENCE IN CERTAIN 
COUNTRIES TO DEFEAT THE SUDANESE CANDIDACIES.  VATICAN 
NUNCIOS (AMBASSADORS) IN SEVERAL KEY COUNTRIES MET WITH 
THEIR HOST COUNTRY FOREIGN MINISTERS AND PRESENTED THE 
CASE.  THE SUDANESE CANDIDACY WAS DEFEATED, AND THE 
VATICAN PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE. 
4.(C) EMBASSY VATICAN HAS ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN 
DEVELOPING CONTACTS AND SOURCES THAT CAN BE USEFUL TO 
YOUR MISSION.  ARCHBISHOP FITZGERALD, THE DIRECTOR OF THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR INTERELIGIOUS DIALOG AND AN EXPERT 
ON ISLAM, HAS MAINTAINED CONTACTS WITH ISLAMIC LEADERS IN 
SUDAN AND IS AN EXPERT ON THE SITUATION.  FABRIZIO 
RICARDI, A LEADER OF THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY (THE 
VATICAN NGO WHICH NEGOTIATED THE MOZAMBIQUE PEACE TREATY) 
HAS BEEN TRAVELLING TO THE SUDAN ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE 
COMBONI FATHERS, A MAJOR CATHOLIC MISSIONARY ORDER WHICH

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.   THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED A NOTE VERBALE 
OCTOBER 26 TO ALL ACCREDITED MISSIONS OUTLINING THE HOLY 
SEE\'S STANDARD POSITION AHEAD OF THE WTO DOHA MINISTERIAL 
THAT DEVELOPED NATIONS SHOULD BE MORE OPEN TO IMPORTS FROM 
THE DEVELOPING WORLD, WHILE WARNING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
AGAINST FOLLOWING A \"CRUDE PROTECTIONIST PATH.\" THE NOTE 
ALSO INCLUDED A COPY OF ITS JULY 2001 TRIPS COUNCIL NON- 
PAPER ENTITLED \"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ACCESS TO BASIC 
MEDICINES\" WHICH PROPOSED GREATER ACCESS TO PHARMACEUTICALS 
IN THE POOREST COUNTRIES. THIS RELEASE FOLLOWED AMBASSADOR\'S 
MEETING (REFTEL) IN WHICH POST AND U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL 
INDUSTRY REPS PRESSED VATICAN CONTACTS FOR GREATER 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED FOR IPR PROTECTION. 
 
------------------ 
FAIR TRADE FOR ALL 
------------------ 
 
2.   THE VATICAN\'S PRE-DOHA DOCUMENT, ENTITLED \"DEVELOPMENT 
DIMENSIONS OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION,\" CALLED FOR 
\"GESTURES OF FLEXIBILITY AND SOLIDARITY\" AS A STEP TOWARDS A 
MORE INCLUSIVE VISION OF WORLD TRADE. THE VATICAN SEES \"THE 
ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT OF POORER COUNTRIES\" AS A PLUS FOR 
GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05650  01 OF 02  311416Z 
SECURITY. THE VATICAN BELIEVES THE LEAST DEVELOPED NATIONS 
HAVE ONLY \"A MARGINAL AND DIMINISHING SHARE\" IN WORLD TRADE. 
FAIR TRADE RELATIONS, ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN, ARE AN 
ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ECONOMIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THE 
VATICAN WARNS THAT ECONOMICS AND TRADE MUST BE PURSUED 
WITHIN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, THE 
PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ELIMINATION OF POVERTY. 
 
3.   THE VATICAN CALLS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF \"TRADE AND 
PRODUCTION DISTORTING EXPORT SUBSIDIES.\" IT SEEKS MARKET 
ACCESS FOR PRODUCTS IN WHICH THE POOREST COUNTRIES HAVE 
COMPARABLE ADVANTAGE. HOWEVER, THE VATICAN WARNED DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES AGAINST FOLLOWING A \"CRUDE PROTECTIONIST PATH,\" 
INSTEAD THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD FOLLOW A \"SOLID AND VIABLE 
PATH TO FREE TRADE THAT PERMITS THEM TO ENTER INTO AN 
EQUITABLE DIALOGUE WITH INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.\" THE ECONOMIC 
AND NEGOTIATING POWER DISADVANTAGES OF LESS INDUSTRIALIZED 
ECONOMIES AND COMMODITY PRODUCER ECONOMIES CAN BE OVERCOME 
BY FULLY IMPLEMENTING THE EXISTING WTO SPECIAL AND 
DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT PRINCIPLE. THE VATICAN URGES THAT 
DEVELOPING NATIONS RECEIVE TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE TO MEET EXISTING WTO OBLIGATIONS. ASSISTANCE IS 
ALSO ASKED TO BROADEN AND DIVERSITY THEIR PRODUCTION AND 
EXPORT BASE AND TRADE PROMOTION EFFORTS. 
 
4.   THE VATICAN LAMENTS THE FACT THAT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
ARE FORCED TO DIVERT VITAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENTING NEW 
INTERNATIONAL DUTIES, ESPECIALLY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
PROTECTION. THE VATICAN CALLS FOR A REVIEW OF TRIPS TO 
BALANCE THE INTERESTS OF DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, 
ESPECIALLY WHEN \"THE LIFE OF PEOPLE COULD BE A STAKE.\" THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05650  01 OF 02  311416Z 
VATICAN ASKS THAT NO TRADE INTEREST HINDER THE MOST 
ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE. 
 
5.   THE VATICAN URGES GREATER TRANSPARENCY FOR THE WTO IN 
ALL ASPECTS OF DECISION MAKING. DEVELOPING NATIONS NEED TO 
\"OWN\" THE DECISIONS THAT IMPACT DIRECTLY ON THEIR ECONOMIES 
AND THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL MARKET. THE VATICAN 
ASKS THAT THE NEGOTIATING AND REPRESENTATIONAL DIFFICULTIES 
OF THESE NATIONS BE CONTINUALLY ADDRESSED. IT ALSO WARNED 
THAT THE WTO COULD NOT RESOLVE ALL THE DEVELOPMENT 
CHALLENGES OF TODAY\'S WORLD AND SUGGESTED THAT ATTEMPTS TO 
OVER-STRETCH ITS MANDATE SHOULD BE RESISTED. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
SOCIAL MORTGAGE ON PHARMACEUTICAL PROFITS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.   THE TRIPS NON-PAPER SUGGESTS ACCESSIBLE PRICE IS A 
DETERMINANT FACTOR IN ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND THAT 
FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL FACTORS MUST BE BALANCED AGAINST HIGH 
PRICING TO ATTRACT INVESTORS AND MAINTAIN RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT. THE VATICAN URGES AN \"INNOVATIVE PRICING 
SYSTEM\" TO PRESERVE R AND D INCENTIVES, SUGGESTING LUXURY 
AND NON-ESSENTIAL PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS (COSMETICS) SHARE 
A GREATER BURDEN FOR R AND D OF ESSENTIAL MEDICINES. 
ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN, \"A BROAD-BASED COMMITMENT OF 
SOLIDARITY IS THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT POOR COUNTRIES FROM 
FALLING INTO THE TEMPTATION OF WEAKENING THE INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY RIGHTS FRAMEWORK.\"

7.   THE VATICAN RECOGNIZES THAT THE COUNCIL FOR TRIPS 
CANNOT RESOLVE THE ACCESSIBILITY TO BASIC MEDICINES PROBLEM. 
IT URGES THE COUNCIL TO MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL CONTRIBUTION THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF TRIPS RULES THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A 
UNIFIED VISION OF LAW, BASED ON RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, 
AND APPLYING THOSE ARTICLES OF THE WTO TREATY THAT CALL FOR 
A PRO-DEVELOPMENT INTERPRETATION OF THE WHOLE LEGAL BODY. 
THE VATICAN SUGGESTS \"THIS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A BROAD AND 
NOT RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES 30 AND 31, WHICH 
WOULD ALLOW THAT LICENSING FEES MAY BE FIXED IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH THE REAL PURCHASING CAPACITY OF THE POOREST COUNTRY, 
BALANCED WITH A SYSTEM THAT BLOCKS THE RE-EXPORT OF THE 
LICENSED PRODUCTS TO THE ORIGINAL MARKETS.\" 
 
8.   COMMENT: IN NONE OF THIS DOES THE VATICAN APPEAR TO

OF THOSE \"DEVELOPING\" COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL 
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY (EG. INDIA, BRAZIL). WE WILL FOLLOW 
UP ON THIS THEME WITH THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR HEALTH CARE

JOINED AMBASSADOR TO BRIEF VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
10/20 ON U.S. EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN.  DFM NOTED THE 
VATICAN WAS ARRANGING A 10/28-10/29 INTERFAITH MEETING IN 
CAIRO OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS THAT WOULD ALSO ADDRESS 9/11 AND 
ITS AFTERMATH.  DFM SKETCHED VARIOUS VATICAN CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN AID TO AFGHAN REFUGEES.  DFM 
INDICATED THERE ARE TWO OR THREE NUNS CURRENTLY WORKING IN 
A KABUL HOSPITAL.  DFM EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE KASHMIR 
SITUATION AND AFGHAN MILITARY CAMPAIGN COULD DESTABILIZE 
THE GOP, WITH REPERCUSSIONS FOR PAKISTAN\'S SIZEABLE 
CATHOLIC MINORITY. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) SOUTH ASIA BUREAU AFGHANISTAN COORDINATOR JEFFREY 
J. LUNSTEAD AND AMBASSADOR BRIEFED VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY 
OFFICIALS 10/20 ON U.S. EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN. THE 
AMBASSADOR AND LUNSTEAD SAW MONSIGNOR CELESTINO MIGLIORE, 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER-EQUIVALENT, AND EAST ASIA AND 
AFGHANISTAN DESK OFFICER MONSIGNOR LUIS MARRANO DE 
MONTEMAYOR; AFGHANISTAN DESK OFFICER GEETA PASI AND EMBOFF 
ALSO ATTENDED. 
 
3.  (C) DFM MIGLIORE SPOKE POSITIVELY OF THE CIRCUMSPECTION 
EVIDENT IN THE U.S. RESPONSE, THOUGH HE NOTED THAT THE HOLY 
SEE COULD NEVER APPLAUD WARFARE.  WITHIN INTERNATIONAL 
BODIES, SUCH AS THE U.N., THE HOLY SEE WOULD SUPPORT 
FURTHER POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL INITIATIVES.  WHERE THE 
HOLY SEE COULD PLAY A DIRECT LEADERSHIP ROLE WAS IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05693  01 OF 02  021700Z 
CULTURAL AFFAIRS, SPECIICALLY THROUGH INTER-RELIGIOUS 
DIALOGUE, MIGLIORE SAID.  HE INDICATED THAT THE 
CONGREGATION FOR RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE, AN INSTITUTIONAL ARM 
OF THE VATICAN, WAS ORGANIZING A MEETING OF ISLAMIC AND 
CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS AT AL-AZHAR UNIVERSITY IN 
CAIRO. 
 
4.  (C) MIGLIORE SHARED CONCERNS THAT THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN 
WAS OUTSTRIPPING POLITICAL STRATEGIES.  HE OBSERVED THAT 
NEIGHBORING NATIONS IN FACT SHARED FEW COMMON INTERESTS, AN 
IMPEDIMENT TO ANY TRUE REGIONAL COALITION.  ADDRESSING THE 
HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY, MIGLIORE VOLUNTEERED THAT IT 
PREDATED THE PRESENT MILITARY CAMPAIGN.  WINTERTIME, HE 
ADDED, WOULD SEE A DRAMATIC WORSENING.  THE VATICAN IS 
CONTRIBUTING AND COORDINATING SOME RELIEF ASSISTANCE, 
THROUGH CARITAS AND COR UNUM (LOOSELY, VATICAN EQUIVALENTS 
TO USAID).  CARITAS,J\'E SQD, HAS AN INFORMAL PRESENCE IN 
TEHERAN.  ALSO, THE SOVEREIGN MILITARY ORDER OF THE KNIGHTS 
OF MALTA (SMOM) IS SET TO INITIATE HUMANITARIAN WORK IN 
IRAN.  SUCH EFFORTS CONSTITUTE EMERGENCY AID ONLY, MIGLIORE 
SAID; A FINAL POLITICAL SOLUTION IS IMPERATIVE.  MOREOVER, 
HE DREADED GLOBAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSE SHOULD THE MILITARY 
CAMPAIGN EXTEND TO IRAQ. 
 
5.  (C) LUNSTEAD SOUGHT INFORMATION ON VATICAN 
PERSONNEL/ECCLESIASTICS STILL IN AFGHANISTAN.  MONTEMAYOR 
STATED THERE WERE THREE NUNS BEFORE MIGLIORE CORRECTED HIM 
THAT ONLY TWO REMAIN, THE THIRD HAVING LEFT FOR FRANCE ON 
MEDICAL GROUNDS.  THE VATICAN HAS NO EASY MEANS TO CONTACT 
THE NUNS, MONTEMAYOR CLAIMED.  THEY WERE FOREIGN NATIONALS, 
LONG RESIDENT IN AFGHANISTAN, AND CURRENTLY WORKING IN THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05693  01 OF 02  021700Z 
INDIRA GANDHI HOSPITAL IN KABUL.  (COMMENT:  MONTEMAYOR 
LATER PHONED EMBOFF TO RELATE THERE ARE INDEED THREE NUNS 
IN KABUL, AFFILIATED WITH INDIRA GANDHI AND A CLINIC BY THE 
NAME OF ALI ABAD.  THE NUNS ARE MEMBERS OF THE LITTLE 
SISTERS OF JESUS. THE VATICAN REQUESTED WE NOT PUBLICIZE 
THEIR PRESENCE IN KABUL.) 
 
6.  (C) MIGLIORE ASKED LUNSTEAD\'S THINKING ON KASHMIR. 
LUNSTEAD CONCEDED THE PROBLEM WAS GRAVE; CERTAIN TERRORISTS 
IN KASHMIR HAD RECEIVED TRAINING IN PAKISTAN AND IN AL- 
QAIDA CAMPS.  THE SECRETARY, HE NOTED, HAD CONDEMNED ALL 
TERRORISM.  GENERAL MUSHARRAFF, HE SUGGESTED, NOW HAD A 
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CURB EXTREMIST ELEMENTS IN HIS 
COUNTRY. 
 
7.   (C) MIGLIORE REQUESTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HUMANITARIAN CAMPAIGN.  LUNDSTEAD 
CONCEDED THERE WERE SEVERE PROBLEMS.  THE SEPTEMBER 
DEPARTURE OF NON-AFGHAN AID WORKERS CAPABLE OF MANAGING 
SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION WAS A COMPLICATING FACTOR. 
MOREOVER, RECENT TALIBAN ACTIONS -- SEIZING WAREHOUSES AND 
BEATING AFGHAN AID WORKERS -- WAS DEEPLY DISTURBING.  THE 
TALIBAN\'S LONGSTANDING LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE AFGHAN 
POPULATION WAS SIGNIFICANT, HE ADDED, WITH THE OUTSIDE

REMOTE SPOTS WERE NOT AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION, YET ADDED 
THESE CONSTITUTED A VALUABLE DEMONSTRATION.  CONCERN RUNS 
HIGH IN IRAN AND PAKISTAN AT A SURGE IN REFUGEES, YET 
MEASURES WERE BEING TAKEN, INCLUDING UNHCR CONSTRUCTION OF 
NEW REFUGEE SITES, IF NEEDED, LUNDSTEAD SAID.  THUS FAR, 
THE FLOW OF NEW REFUGEES HAS REMAINED LOW. 
 
8.   (C) LUNSTEAD, AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S ENCOURAGEMENT, 
REMARKED BRIEFLY ON HIS 10/19 ENCOUNTER WITH THE KING.  HE 
DESCRIBED THE KING AS PHYSICALLY FRAIL BUT MENTALLY ACUTE, 
WITH NO DESIRE TO RETURN TO RULE IN AFGHANISTAN, JUST AN 
EXILE\'S HOPE FOR BURIAL IN HIS HOMELAND.  HIS ENTOURAGE WAS 
HAMPERED BY INTRIGUE, LUNSTEAD ADDED. ASKED BY MIGLIORE IF 
THE KING WERE WILLING TO ASSUME LEADERSHIP, LUNDSTEAD 
ANSWERED THAT THE KING KNEW HE WOULD NEVER RULE AGAIN BUT 
VIEWED HIS ROLE AS THAT OF A CATALYST.  HE WAS AN OLD MAN, 
WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT SECURITY THREATS THAT KEPT HIM FROM 
HIS DAILY GARDEN STROLL.  THE U.S. HARBORED NO ILLUSIONS, 
LUNSTEAD SAID, ADDING THE KING\'S ENTOURAGE HAD BEEF 
IRRESOLUTE IN THE PAST. 
 
9.  (C) ASKED TO EXPAND ON THE AFOREMENTIONED CAIRO 
ENCOUNTER, MIGLIORE STIPULATED THE 10/28-10/29 AL-AZHAR 
MEETING WOULD BE AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION AND WOULD RESPOND 
TO SEPTEMBER 11 AND ITS AFTERMATH.  MIGLIORE EMPHASIZED 
THAT THE HOLY SEE IS A SPIRITUAL, ETHICAL AND MORAL ENTITY, 
WHOSE MISSION IS NOT POLITICAL BUT RELIGIOUS.  THE MASSES 
IN ISLAMIC SOCIETIES, HE OBSERVED, DEPEND ON RELIGIOUS 
LEADERSHIP; IF RELIGIOUS LEADERS WILL NOT DISTANCE 
THEMSELVES FROM VIOLENCE, THEN NEITHER WILL THE POPULATION 
AT LARGE.  MIGLIORE SUGGESTED THE HOLY SEE CAN PLAY A ROLE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05693  02 OF 02  021700Z 
TO CONVINCE RELIGIOUS COUNTERPARTS TO REPUDIATE VIOLENCE. 
MIGLIORE LEVIED FAINT PRAISE AT A SIMILAR EFFORT HELD BY 
SANT\'EGIDIO 10/3-10/4 IN ROME. (COMMENT:  SANT\'EGIDIO IS A 
PROMINENT ROME-BASED CATHOLIC NGO FAMED FOR CONFLICT 
RESOLUTION, NOTABLY THE PEACEFUL END TO THE MOZAMBIQUE 
CIVIL WAR BROKERED IN 1993.)  MIGLIORE LAUDED SANT\'EGIDIO\'S 
ABILITY TO GATHER ISLAMIC LEADERS QUICKLY, YET HE 
QUESTIONED THE VALUE OF A GET-TOGETHER THAT DID NOT PRODUCE 
A PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE, NOT JUST A DOCUMENT 
SIGNED IN ENGLISH THAT WOULD NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY IN 
PARTICIPANT\'S HOME COUNTRIES.  MAYBE FUTURE SANT\'EGIDIO 
MEETINGS WOULD BE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE, MIGLIORE MUSED. 
 
10.  (C) THE CURRENT MILITARY ACTIVITY IS NOT DIRECTED 
AGAINST AFGHANS OR ISLAM BUT TERRORISM.  WHILE COMMITTED TO 
THE COALITION, MUSHARRAF FACES DOMESTIC PRESSURE BECAUSE 
PAKISTANIS OPPOSE THE AIR CAMPAIGN, AND HE HAS CALLED FOR 
ITS EARLY END.  MONTEMAYOR REMARKED CATHOLIC LEADERSHIP 
LIKQ7I#5=AQ\'M.  MIGLIORE WORRIED FURTHER AT 
THE RISK TO PAKISTAN\'S STABILITY AND TO ITS ONE MILLION- 
STRONG CATHOLIC POPULATION. LUNDSTEAD HOWEVER VOICED 
CONFIDENCE IN GENERAL MUSHARRAFF, PRAISING HIS SWIFT 
REPUDIATION OF THE TALIBAN, A TURNAROUND THAT RAISES HOPES 
MUSHARRAFF WILL NOW ALSO FACE DOWN RADICAL ISLAM WITHIN 
PAKISTAN, THEREBY ALSO BETTERING CONDITIONS FOR PAKISTAN\'S 
RELIGIOUS MINORITIES. 
 
11.  (C) THE OFFICE OF THE SOUTH ASIA BUREAU AFGHANISTAN 
COORDINATOR HAS CLEARED THIS CABLE.

MINISTER CELESTINO MIGLIORE, OCTOBER 31.  THE PURPOSE OF 
THE CALL WAS TO DISCUSS ON GOING EMBASSY ANTI-TRAFFICKING 
PROJECTS (SEPTEL) AND PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY CHAIR YASSAR 
ARAFAT\'S OCTOBER 30 MEETING WITH THE POPE. 
 
2. (C) MIGLIORE SAID THAT AT THIS 11TH VISIT WITH THE 
POPE (HE JOKED ABOUT THE FREQUENCY WHICH ARAFAT COMES TO 
THE VATICAN), NOTHING NEW WAS DISCUSSED.  MIGLIORE DID 
SAY THAT THE POPE TRIED TO IMPRESS UPON ARAFAT THE NEED 
FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO CONTROL THE PALESTINIAN MILITANTS 
AND TO END THE VIOLENCE.  MIGLIORE ALSO VOLUNTEERED THE 
VATICAN VIEW THAT DESPITE SUGGESTIONS ARAFAT IS LOSING 
HIS GRIP AND CANNOT CONTROL THE MILITANTS, ARAFAT, IN 
FACT, IS STILL \"POWERFUL\" AND CAN CONTROL THE MILITANTS 
\"WHEN HE WANTS TO\". 
 
3. (C) COMMENT:  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE VATICAN 
HAS STRESSED TO THE MISSION ITS URGING OF THE 
PALESTINIANS TO END THE VIOLENCE, AS OPPOSED TO ITS 
SYMPATHY FOR THE SUFFERING OF THE PALESTINIANS IN FACE OF 
ISRAELI ACTIONS.  THIS COULD BE A SUBTLE SHIFT ON THE 
PART OF THE VATICAN INDICATING A MORE BALANCED VIEW. 
CORROBORATING THIS SUPPOSITION IS A REPORT GIVEN TO DCM 
BY HIS ISRAELI COUNTERPART, ZVI TAL (PROTECT).  ACCORDING 
TO TAL, THE PAPAL NUNCIO IN ISRAEL WAS RECENTLY 
REPRIMANDED BY THE VATICAN FOR TAKING PART IN A 
PALESTINIAN ORGANIZED PEACE MARCH.  NICHOLSON

NICHOLSON, DIRECTOR OF MEDIA FOR THE CONGREGATION FOR THE 
PROPAGATION OF THE FAITH (FIDES), FATHER BENARDO 
CERVELLERA, SPOKE AT LENGTH ON HIS VIEWS OF RECENT 
VATICAN/PRC DEVELOPMENTS.  CERVELLERA SAID THAT ALTHOUGH 
THE POPE\'S 10/24 STATEMENT APOLOGIZING TO THE CHINESE 
PEOPLE FOR THE \"MISTAKES\' MADE BY EARLY CHRISTIAN 
MISSIONARIES AND FOR A RESUMPTION OF DIALOG BETWEEN THE 
PRC AND THE HOLY SEE WAS WELL RECEIVED BY THE CHINESE 
PEOPLE, IT \"FELL ON DEAF EARS\" WITHIN THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT.  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE SEES THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ANY RESUMPTION OF DIALOG BETWEEN CHINA AND 
THE HOLY SEE AIMED AT NORMALIZING RELATIONS BEFORE 
ELECTIONS THE MARCH ELECTIONS IN CHINA TO BE NIL. (NOTE: 
WE HEARD THE SAME FROM OUR TAIWAN EMBASSY CONTACTS). 
 
2.  (C)  CERVELLERA ALSO DISCUSSED THE ROLE OF THE 
\"OFFICIAL\" CHURCH AND THE UNDERGROUND CHURCH IN CHINA. 
HE BELIEVES 80 PERCENT OF THE \"OFFICIAL\" CHURCH IS LOYAL 
TO THE POPE.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE REMAINING \"OLD 
LINERS\" IN THE \"OFFICIAL\" CHURCH ARE DYING OFF.  IN 
EFFECT, THERE IS NO LONGER EVEN A DE FACTO SCHISM BETWEEN 
THE VATICAN AND CHINESE CATHOLICISM.   THE ONLY PROBLEM 
IS THE \"PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION\" WHICH BEIJING USES TO 
CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF THE \"OFFICIAL\" CHURCH.

PAGE 03        VATICA  05814  091331Z 
 
3. (C)  COMMENT:  CERVELLERA AND FIDES ARE STRONGLY 
IDENTIFIED WITH THE FACTION IN THE VATICAN WHICH OPPOSES 
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA UNTIL THE COMMUNISM 
ARE REMOVED.  THAT SAID, HIS BELIEF THAT THERE WON\'T BE 
ANY MOVEMENT UNTIL AFTER MARCH IS SHARED EVEN BY THOSE 
WHO WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF QUICK RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOG 
(REF).  CERVELLERA\'S VIEWS ON THE \"OFFICIAL\" CHURCH ARE 
QUITE PROGRESSIVE AND APPEAR TO REFLECT THE VATICAN\'S 
ATTEMPT TO FULLY HEAL THE RIFT BETWEEN THE UNDERGROUND 
CHURCH AND THE \"OFFICIAL CHURCH\" EVEN BEFORE THERE IS A 
POLITICAL DIALOG WITH BEIJING.

2.  (C) SUMMARY: SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY HOPES TO HOST A 
CONFIDENTIAL OFF-SITE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE GOS AND SPLM 
 
SIPDIS 
TO UNBLOCK THE IGAD PROCESS.  SANT\'EGIDIO SUDAN EXPERT 
RICCARDI, JUST BACK FROM KHARTOUM, WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH

ACTION REQUESTED: POST WOULD APPRECIATE GUIDANCE ON 
RESPONDING TO RICCARDI\'S OFFER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C)  FRESH BACK FROM HIS TRIP TO SUDAN, SANT\'EGIDIO 
SUDAN SPECIALIST FABIO RICCARDI (TOGETHER WITH MARIO GIRO, 
SANT\'EGIDIO\'S WEST AFRICA SPECIALIST) WAS EAGER TO TALK 
WITH EMBASSY VATICAN ABOUT HIS MEETINGS IN KHARTOUM.  ON 
11/09 RICCARDI TOLD DCM THAT SANT\'EGIDIO HAS GOOD CONTACTS 
WITH BOTH SIDES ON THE CONFLICT, AND THAT IT IS NOT 
INTERESTED IN THE BLAME-GAME PRACTICED BY SOME OF SUDAN\'S 
CATHOLIC BISHOPS.  HE SAID SANT\'EGIDIO WISHES TO ENCOURAGE 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND BELIEVES THE POST 9/11 
ATMOSPHERE OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SO.  HE REPLAYED 
SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME POINTS IN REF A, FOCUSING ON THE 
FACT THAT IGAD HAS STALLED, AND SOME CATALYST IS NEED TO 
REINVIGORATE IT.  HE SAID THAT NEITHER PARTY, BUT 
ESPECIALLY THE GOS, TAKES IGAD SERIOUSLY -- MOSTLY THEY USE 
IT TO SCORE PROPAGANDA POINTS ON EACH OTHER.  RICCARDI 
PROPOSES THAT SANT\'EGIDIO HOST AT ITS HEADQUARTERS IN ROME 
A SERIES OF CONFIDENTIAL FACE-TO-FACE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOS AND SPLM, WHICH WOULD PERMIT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

UNBLOCKING THE EXISTING PROCESS.  (NOTE: THIS IS A FORMULA 
WHICH WORKED TEN YEARS AGO WHEN SANT\'EGIDIO MEDIATED THE 
END TO THE MOZAMBIQUE CIVIL WAR). 
 
2.  (C)  RICCARDI TOLD US THAT HE HAD RAISED HIS IDEA OF 
PRIVATE OFF-SITE MEETINGS WITH SENIOR SUDANESE OFFICIALS, 
INCLUDING GHAZZI SALAHADDIN AND THE FM (WHO HE SAID WAS 
\"STUPID\"),  NONE OF WHOM REJECTED IT.  GARANG WOULD BE AN 
OBSTACLE, HE SAID, INDICATING HE HAD SPOKEN WITH MUSEVENI 
WHILE THE LATTER WAS IN LONDON, WHO GAVE HIM STRONG SIGNALS 
THAT GARANG WOULD NEED PERSUADING.  RICCARDI TOLD US THE 
U.S. WOULD BE KEY, IF THIS PROPOSAL (WE HESITATE TO CALL IT 
AN INITIATIVE) WERE TO GET OFF THE GROUND.  IF GARANG COULD 
BE PERSUADED, RICCARDI AND GIRO BOTH WERE CONFIDENT THEY 
COULD GET MEANINGFUL GOS PARTICIPATION TOO. 
 
3.  (C)  POST UNDERSTANDS THAT SPECIAL ENVOY DANFORTH AND 
AF ARE CONTEMPLATING A VISIT TO EUROPEAN CAPITALS IN 
DECEMBER.  RICCARDI WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN MEETING THE 
U.S. DELEGATION IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN.  WE SUPPORT SUCH A 
MEETING AND REITERATE OUR OFFER (REF C) TO FACILITATE 
MEETINGS BETWEEN THE S/E AND RICCARDI, AS WELL AS WITH ANY

1.  (C) SUMMARY: VATICAN CRITICISM OF THE WAR EFFORT IS NOW 
LESS LIKELY, ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN AFGHANISTAN DESK 
OFFICER, SINCE ADVANCES BY THE U.S.-LED COALITION 
FACILITATE A MORE EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO AFGHANISTAN\'S 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAN ANTICIPATED. THE VATICAN HOWEVER 
JUDGES ISLAMABAD AN UNRELIABLE COALITION PLAYER AND 
DISTRUSTS MUSHARRAF.  POST RECOMMENDS DEPARTMENT EXPLORE 
MEANS TO ENGAGE THE VATICAN IN HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN 
AFGHANISTAN IN ORDER TO REINFORCE TACIT VATICAN SUPPORT FOR 
U.S. POLICY GOALS IN AFGHANISTAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE CHECKED 
MOUNTING VATICAN MISGIVINGS AT THE WAR EFFORT (REF. A), 
AFGHANISTAN DESK OFFICER MONSIGNOR LUIS MONTEMAYOR TOLD 
POLOFF IN AN 11/14 MEETING.  A NEGATIVE VATICAN OR PAPAL 
STATEMENT IS NOW EVEN LESS LIKELY, HE SAID, SINCE THE 
TERRITORIAL ADVANCES OF THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE WOULD 
FACILITATE THE RETURN OF NGOS TO AFGHANISTAN AND THE 
DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AID. 
 
3.  (C) MONTEMAYOR ALSO INFORMED POLOFF THE THREE NUNS IN 
KABUL WERE WELL (REF. B) AS OF 11/4. THE NUNS, MEMBERS OF 
THE LITTLE SISTERS OF JESUS, WERE ASSISTING AT THE INDIRA 
GANDHI HOSPITAL (STILL FUNCTIONING, IF UNOFFICIALLY, HE 
ADDED) AND AT THE ALI ABAD CLINIC. 
 
4.  (C) MONTEMAYOR EXPRESSED PERSONAL SATISFACTION AT THE 
PROGRESS OF THE U.S.-LED CAMPAIGN HOWEVER HE REITERATED THE 
VATICAN\'S HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS.  HE VOICED SKEPTICISM THAT 
AFGHAN TRIBAL LEADERS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE OF THE NORTHERN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05960  191507Z 
ALLIANCE, COULD PRODUCE A FUNCTIONING AND EQUITABLE 
GOVERNMENT.  THE VATICAN WAS CLOSELY TRACKING ALLEGATIONS 
OF ATROCITIES IN MAZAR-I-SHARIF AND HEART, HE SAID, ADDING 
THAT THE CURRENT MILITARY ACTION RISKED DEGRADING INTO 
TRIBAL VENDETTA BY OTHER MEANS. 
 
5.  (C) PAKISTAN, MONTEMAYOR STATED, REMAINS A NATION OF 
GRAVE CONCERN, BOTH IN REGARD TO THE PLIGHT OF ITS ONE 
MILLION CATHOLICS, WHICH THE VATICAN CONSIDERS OPPRESSED, 
AND IN TERMS OF ITS OVERALL STABILITY. MONTEMAYOR MADE 
CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE VATICAN AND 
MUSHARRAF.  IN A LATE OCTOBER VISIT TO ISLAMABAD BY 
ARCHBISHOP PAUL CORDES, HEAD OF COR UNUM, THE VATICAN\'S 
UMBRELLA AID ARM, CONTACT WITH MUSHARRAF AND THE GOP WAS 
KEPT TO A MINIMUM.  MONTEMAYOR REMARKED THAT INITIALLY 
PAKISTAN\'S BISHOPS HAD CAUTIOUSLY WELCOMED MUSHARRAF\'S COUP 
IN THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD EASE ANTI-BLASPHEMY LAWS 
FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED TO KEEP RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN CHECK. 
MUSHARRAF HOWEVER WAS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO CHALLENGE 
ISLAMIC RADICALS AND THE CONDITIONS OF PAKISTAN\'S CATHOLICS 
WORSENED.  THE VATICAN STRONGLY DOUBTS REPORTS OF A SEA 
CHANGE IN MUSHARRAF\'S POLITICS.  MONTEMAYOR SUGGESTED THAT 
IF BIN LADEN FINDS REFUGE IN BALUCHISTAN, THE U.S. WOULD 
FIND MUSHARRAF HARD PUT TO DELIVER ON HIS PLEDGES. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE SECRETARY\'S CALL TO TAURAN HAS 
STRENGTHENED THE VATICAN MFA SUPPORT OF THE U.S.-LED WAR 
EFFORT.  NEVERTHELESS, IN OTHER VATICAN QUARTERS -- 
MONTEMAYOR REFERRED TO AN INTERNAL \"HUMANITARIAN LOBBY\" -- 
PATIENCE WITH THE U.S.-LED WAR EFFORT HAD BEEN WEARING 
THIN.  HOWEVER, THE LATEST MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05960  191507Z 
AFGHANISTAN HAVE UNDERCUT THOSE WHO WERE URGING THE VATICAN 
OPPOSE THE WAR EFFORT.  THE DEPARTMENT CAN REINFORCE ITS 
SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE VATICAN BY SHARING ITS VIEWS ON THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.  U.S. INCLUSION 
OF COR UNUM (AND CARITAS, A RELATED RELIEF ARM) WOULD HELP 
ELEVATE THE VATICAN TO THE RANK OF A COALITION PARTNER IN 
THE NEXT PHASE OF OUR EFFORTS.

TAGS: PINR, VT 
SUBJECT: AGE PREVENTS POPE TRAVELING TO OCEANIA 
 
 
1.   POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S INCREASING INFIRMITY HAS PREVENTED 
HIM TRAVELING TO OCEANIA TO PROMULGATE A NEW CHURCH DOCUMENT 
FOR THE REGION. THE VATICAN CITED DISTANCE AND THE EFFECT OF 
THE FLIGHT ON THE POPE\'S HEALTH AS THE REASONS FOR ISSUING THE 
DOCUMENT IN ROME, NOVEMBER 22, VIA INTERNET (A FIRST FOR THE 
VATICAN). IN THE RECENT PAST, THE POPE HAS CONDUCTED THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  06026  231203Z 
PRESENTATION CEREMONIES IN THE REGIONS THAT WERE THE SUBJECT 
OF PREVIOUS DOCUMENTS: THE AMERICAS, AFRICA, EUROPE AND ASIA. 
 
2.   POPE JOHN PAUL II IS 81. HE IS BECOMING FRAILER WITH EACH 
PASSING YEAR. IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE POPE SUFFERS FROM A 
NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, PROBABLY PARKINSON\'S. THE VATICAN HAS 
INSTITUTED VARIOUS PROCEDURES AND TOOLS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER 
FOR THE PONTIFF - A SPECIAL LECTERN ON HIS CHAIR FOR THE PAGES 
OF HIS SPEECHES BECAUSE TREMORS PRECLUDE HIM HOLDING THE TEXT; 
A WHEELED PLATFORM TO MOVE HIM UP THE AISLE OF SAINT PETER\'S 
BASILICA. (THE AISLE IS 211 METERS LONG). POPE JOHN PAUL NOW 
WEARS A HEARING AID, ALTHOUGH HE DOES NOT REQUIRE SPECTACLES 
TO READ, AND OFTEN USES A CANE WHEN WALKING. 
 
3.   COMMENT: THE VATICAN IS ADAPTING ITSELF TO THE NEEDS OF 
THE AGING AND INCREASINGLY FRAIL POPE. THE PONTIFF INSISTS ON 
PERFORMING AS MANY OF HIS DUTIES AS POSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH HIS 
SCHEDULE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THE ESSENTIAL, IT WOULD BE 
DEMANDING FOR ANY OCTOGENARIAN. WHILE THE POPE\'S BODY MAY BE 
SLOWING DOWN, ALL THOSE WHO MEET WITH THE POPE SAY HIS MIND 
REMAINS ACTIVE AND ALERT. THE VATICAN WILL CONTINUE TO 
ACCOMMODATE THE AGING PONTIFF SO THAT THE DIGNITY AND MORE 
IMPORTANTLY, THE PUBLIC NATURE OF THE OFFICE IS MAINTAINED FOR 
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. END COMMENT. NICHOLSON

CARDINALS 
 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR R. JAMES NICHOLSON FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B) (D). 
 
1.  (C) AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON PAID COURTESY CALL ON 
CARDINAL BERNARDIN GANTIN, DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  06036  231635Z 
CARDINALS ON NOVEMBER 23.  THE CARDINAL AGAIN 
EXPRESSED HIS OUTRAGE AND CONDOLENCES FOR THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 TRAGEDY.  GANTIN ALSO SPOKE AT LENGTH ON 
HIS CLOSE TIES WITH THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS HIS 
HOPES TO VISIT IN DECEMBER IF HIS HEALTH PERMITS. 
 
2. (C) CARDINAL GANTIN RAISED ONE ISSUE OF SUBSTANCE, 
NIGERIA.  HE ASKED THE AMBASSADOR IF HE HAS FOCUSED ON 
NIGERIA.  THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT HE HAS NOT YET, 
BUT EMBASSY VATICAN IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH 
SANT\'EGIDIO ON A NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN AFRICA, AND WE 
HOPE THAT SENATOR DANFORTH WILL TRAVEL TO THE VATICAN 
IN DECEMBER TO DISCUSS SUDAN.  CARDINAL GANTIN SAID 
THAT HE RAISED NIGERIA FOR TWO REASONS.  THE FIRST IS 
THAT THE ONLY TWO BLACK AFRICAN CARDINALS IN THE ROMAN 
CURIA ARE HE (FROM NEIGHBORING BENIN), AND CARDINAL 
ARINZE FROM NIGERIA.  THE SECOND REASON IS THAT HE IS 
PERSONALLY VERY CONCERNED WITH THE NORTHERN NIGERIAN 
ISLAMIC/CHRISTIAN VIOLENCE IN THE BENIN BORDER REGION. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH RETIRED FROM VATICAN 
GOVERNMENT SERVICE, AS DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF 
CARDINALS, GANTIN COULD PRESIDE OVER THE DISCUSSIONS 
AND VOTES OF THE COLLEGE OF CARDINALS IN THE EVENT OF 
THE DEATH OF THE POPE.  THUS, HE REMAINS AN INDIVIDUAL 
OF CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN THE VATICAN.  IF THE 
CARDINAL TRAVELS TO THE UNITED STATES IN DECEMBER, 
POST RECOMMENDS HE MEET WITH APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS IN 
THE BUREAU OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS TO DISCUSS HIS CONCERNS 
WITH THE SITUATION IN NIGERIA.

REF: A) VATICAN 5999; REF B) VATICAN 5695 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMB. JAMES NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SECRETARY TAURAN IS TRAVELLING TO BUCHAREST 
SPECIFICALLY TO MEET WITH THE SECRETARY.  HE TOLD 
AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON ON NOVEMBER 20(REF A) THAT THE 
POPE HAD INSTRUCTED HIM TO MEET THE SECRETARY AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT 
THE TWO TOPICS THAT THE POPE ASKED HIM TO RAISE WITH 
THE SECRETARY ARE THE CURRENT SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN 
AND THE MIDDLE EAST. 
 
2. (C) AFGHANISTAN: VATICAN CONCERNS AT THE U.S.-LED 
AFGHANISTAN CAMPAIGN BOIL DOWN TO FEARS OF AN 
UNCONTROLLED HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, DISTRUST OF THE 
PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT, AND A JUDGMENT THAT IRAQ SHOULD 
NOT BE THE TARGET OF ANY EXTENSION OF THE CONFLICT. 
WORRIES OF A HUMANITARIAN MELTDOWN TRIGGERED A NUMBER 
OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS FROM THE POPE, NONE OF WHICH 
CRITICIZED OF THE WAR EFFORT.  INDEED, THE POPE 
RESERVED THE HARSHEST CRITICISM THAT WE\'VE EVER SEEN 
FROM HIM FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS \"INHUMAN ATTACK 
OF SEPTEMBER 11.\"  FM TAURAN HIMSELF SUPPORTED THE 
U.S.\' RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE (A KEY COMPONENT, ALONG 
WITH PROPORTIONALITY OF RESPONSE, OF THE VATICAN\'S 
THEORY OF JUST WAR) IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE FRENCH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  06098  01 OF 02  271624Z 
MAGAZINE LA CROIX.  VATICAN FM EQUIVALENT CARDINAL 
SODANO EXPRESSED NOVEMBER 19 HIS HOPE THAT THE FALL OF 
THE TALIBAN WOULD \"LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF A 
DEMOCRATIC STATE, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, FREEDOM 
AND ESPECIALLY RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.\"  HE ALSO DEBUNKED 
THE NOTION THAT THE AFGHANISTAN CONFLICT IS 
THREATENING INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE. 
 
3.  (C)  CARITAS, A VATICAN AID ARM, HIGHLIGHTED THE 
VATICAN\'S CONCERN BY LAUNCHING A WORLDWIDE APPEAL FOR 
HUMANITARIAN RELIEF FOR AFGHANISTAN ON 10/25, 
INITIALLY SEEKING USD 11 MILLION.  ABOUT THE SAME 
TIME, THE VATICAN DFM CONVEYED THAT SHOULD THE 
CONFLICT DRAG ON AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THUS 
WORSEN, THE VATICAN WOULD FIND IT HARD TO REFRAIN FROM 
TAKING A MORE CRITICAL STANCE TOWARD THE CAMPAIGN. 
VATICAN WORRIES HAVE LESSENED SOMEWHAT FOLLOWING ANTI- 
TALIBAN TERRITORIAL GAINS, WHICH THE VATICAN HOPES 
FAVOR THE RESUMPTION, INCREASE, AND MORE EFFICIENT 
DISTRIBUTION OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. AFGHANISTAN 
AND THE VATICAN SHARE NO HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP AND 
CHRISTIANS IN AFGHANISTAN ARE FEW IN NUMBER, THESE 
BEING THE FACTORS THAT COMMONLY DRIVE VATICAN 
BILATERAL FOREIGN POLICY. STILL, THE VATICAN EXPRESSES 
CONCERN THAT THE CONFLICT COULD UNDERMINE THE 
STABILITY OF PAKISTAN, THUS WORSENING THE DIFFICULT 
SITUATION OF THAT NATION\'S ONE MILLION CATHOLICS. THE 
VATICAN MFA MOREOVER DOUBTS THE STEADINESS AND 
TRUSTWORTHINESS OF GENERAL MUSHARRAF, REPROACHED FOR A 
FAILURE TO PROTECT CHRISTIAN MINORITIES AND FOR 
FOMENTING VIOLENCE IN KASHMIR.  LASTLY, THE VATICAN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  06098  01 OF 02  271624Z 
MFA HAS INDICATED -- QUIETLY THUS FAR -- THAT IT WOULD 
VIEW POORLY AN EXTENSION OF THE WAR INTO IRAQ (WHERE 
MANY MORE CHALCEDONIAN CHRISTIANS ENJOY RELATIVE -- 
FOR AN ISLAMIC COUNTRY -- FREEDOM UNDER THE BAATHIST 
REGIME).  INDEED, THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY WILL BE 
LISTENING ATTENTIVELY SHOULD THE POPE PUBLICLY DECLARE 
THAT IRAQ MUST REMAIN OFF-LIMITS. 
 
4.  (C) THE MIDDLE EAST: THE VATICAN WISHES TO CLARIFY 
ITS POSITION ON THE MIDDLE EAST.  IT IS A POSITION 
THAT HAS EVOLVED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST THREE 
YEARS.  FOR MANY YEARS, THE VATICAN CALLED FOR THE 
\"INTERNATIONALIZATION\" OF JERUSALEM.  IN THE LATE 90\'S 
THIS POSITION CHANGED TO THE \"INTERNATIONALIZATION\" OF 
JERUSALEM \"INTRAMURA\" (WITHIN THE WALLS).  FOR 
APPROXIMATELY A YEAR NOW, THE VATICAN HAS REFORMULATED 
ITS POSITION.  IT HAS DROPPED THE CALL FOR 
INTERNATIONALIZATION.  IT IS NOW ASKING THAT THE 
SHRINES OF THE THREE RELIGIONS PRESERVE THEIR UNIQUE 
AND SACRED CHARACTER THROUGH \"INTERNATIONAL 
GUARANTEES\", IN SUCH A WAY THAT IN THE FUTURE \"NONE OF 
THE PARTIES WILL BE ABLE TO CLAIM FOR ITSELF EXCLUSIVE 
CONTROL OF THESE SACRED PARTS OF THE CITY\".  POLITICAL 
SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE CITY WOULD BE A MATTER FOR THE 
ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS TO NEGOTIATE.  THE POPE 
HAS PUBLICLY CALLED FOR BOTH/BOTH SIDES TO STOP THE 
SPIRAL OF VIOLENCE.  ANOTHER INDICATION THAT THE 
VATICAN IS ATTEMPTING TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN 
THE PEACE PROCESS IS THE OCTOBER 30 MEETING BETWEEN 
POPE JOHN PAUL AND CHAIRMAN ARAFAT.  AT THAT MEETING 
(REF B), THE POPE STRONGLY URGED ARAFAT TO PERSONALLY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUBJECT: VATICAN CONDEMNS CLONING EXPERIMENT 
 
REFTEL: VATICAN 1745 
 
1.   THE VATICAN HAS REITERATED ITS UNEQUIVOCAL CONDEMNATION 
OF HUMAN CLONING FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY ADVANCED CELL 
TECHNOLOGY THAT IT HAD CARRIED OUT THE PROCEDURE. THE VATICAN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  06121  281208Z 
DECLARED THE EVENT AS A \"GRAVE\" DEVELOPMENT. THE VATICAN 
INSISTS THE CELLS ARE HUMAN LIFE AND THAT SCIENTISTS SHOULD 
ACKNOWLEDGE THEY ARE DEALING WITH HUMAN EMBRYOS INSTEAD OF 
TALKING ABOUT CLUSTERS OF CELLS. 
 
2.   CLAIMS OF THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF CLONED HUMAN 
EMBRYOS WERE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR THE VATICAN, WHICH 
CRITICIZED THE HIERARCHY OF THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE APPARENTLY 
INTRODUCED BY THE THERAPIES. FOR THE VATICAN EVERY HUMAN LIFE, 
FROM CELL ONE TO NATURAL DEATH, HAS EQUAL VALUE. IF ONE 
PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT STAGE IS SINGLED OUT FOR USE BY ANOTHER 
MORE MATURE STAGE, IT WARNED OF A NEW FORM OF DISCRIMINATION 
BASED ON \"STAGE OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT\" - AN EMBRYO BEING WORTH 
LESS THAN A FETUS, AN INFANT HAVING LESS VALUE THAN AN ADULT 
AND SO ON. THE VATICAN STATEMENT PROMOTED ALTERNATIVE STEM 
CELL RESEARCH AND THERAPY USING STEM CELLS FROM ADULTS AND 
SPONTANEOUSLY ABORTED FETUSES WHICH IT DECLARED SCIENTIFICALLY 
VALID AND MORALLY LICIT. 
 
3.   NOTE: POLOFF WAS TOLD BY A SENIOR OFFICIAL OF THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR LIFE (BIOETHICAL ISSUES) THAT HE FELT 
\"BETRAYED\" BY THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH HE EXPECTED TO PREVENT 
CLONING TAKING PLACE. THE PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS 11/26 DECLARING 
CLONING \"WRONG\" WERE REPORTED BY VATICAN-BASED MEDIA. WE 
EXPECT THE VATICAN WILL APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS. 
END NOTE. 
 
4.   COMMENT: WE DO NOT EXPECT THE VATICAN TO CHANGE ITS 
POSITION ON HUMAN CLONING. HOWEVER, SHOULD THE PROCEDURE 
EVENTUALLY LEAD TO MATURE HUMAN \"CLONES\" TAKING THEIR PLACE IN 
SOCIETY THEN THE VATICAN WOULD URGE FULL RESPECT AND RIGHTS TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  06121  281208Z

WHAT IT DEFINES AS MORALLY ILLICIT PROCEDURES. END COMMENT.

 MEETING IS BEING ORGANIZED BY THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, 
 AND NOT ONE OF THE VATICAN COUNCILS (I.E. MINISTRIES) WHICH 
 WOULD NORMALLY BE INVOLVED IN RELIGIOUS/PASTORAL AFFAIRS.

 THE MEETING WAS MEANT TO COINCIDE WITH A DOCUMENT ISSUED BY 
 THE CHRISTIAN LEADERS IN ISRAEL AND THE TERRITORIES 
 CONDEMNING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NAZARETH MOSQUE. 
 
 3. (C) COMMENT: THE TIMING OF THIS MEETING, COUPLED WITH 
 THE VATICAN\'S REQUEST FOR A MEETING WITH SECRETARY POWELL 
 IS A STRONG INDICATION THAT THE VATICAN IS PREPARED TO 
 BEGIN ACTIVELY PUSHING WHAT IT CONSIDERS ITS INTERESTS IN 
 THE MEPP.  IT IS LIKELY THAT IT SEES AN OPENING CREATED BY 
 THE WAR ON TERRORISM TO PRESSURE THE ISRAELIS ON THE ISSUE 
 OF INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES FOR THE RELIGIOUS SHRINES.  IT 
 IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THAT FOREIGN MINISTER WILL RAISE THE 
 ISSUE OF THE NAZARETH MOSQUE WHEN HE MEETS THE SECRETARY ON

SUBJECT: BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION FOR CLAUDIO GUGEROTTI - 
NEW VATICAN AMBASSADOR TO ARMENIA AND GEORGIA 
 
1.   THE POPE HAS APPOINTED ITALIAN-BORN VATICAN OFFICIAL, 
MONSIGNOR CLAUDIO GUGEROTTI, AS NUNCIO (AMBASSADOR) IN 
ARMENIA AND GEORGIA. GUGEROTTI IS CURRENTLY UNDER-SECRETARY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  06433  121437Z 
(NUMBER THREE) AT THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE EASTERN 
CHURCHES. HE WAS BORN IN VERONA, ITALY IN 1955 AND ORDAINED 
A PRIEST IN 1982. MONSIGNOR GUGEROTTI HOLDS A DOCTORAL 
DEGREE IN ORIENTAL LANGUAGES AND LITERATURE AND A MASTERS 
DEGREE IN LITURGY. HE HAS TAUGHT PATRISTICS, THEOLOGY AND 
EASTERN RITE LITURGY AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL.  GUGEROTTI ENTERED 
THE VATICAN\'S CIVIL SERVICE IN 1985, WORKING EXCLUSIVELY 
SINCE THEN FOR THE CONGREGATION FOR THE EASTERN CHURCH. HE 
BECAME UNDER-SECRETARY IN 1997. AS WELL AS HIS NATIVE 
ITALIAN, GUGEROTTI SPEAKS FRENCH, ENGLISH, LATIN, GREEK, 
CLASSICAL AND MODERN ARMENIAN, AND KURDISH.  MONSIGNOR 
GUGEROTTI WILL BE ORDAINED AN ARCHBISHOP PRIOR TO TAKING UP 
HIS APPOINTMENT. 
 
2.   COMMENT: GUGEROTTI IS A RISING STAR IN THE VATICAN 
CIVIL SERVICE. HE IS A PROTQGQ OF THE FORMER PREFECT OF THE 
CONGREGATION FOR THE EASTERN CHURCHES, CARDINAL ACHILLE 
SILVESTRINI. GUGEROTTI IS URBANE AND EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT, 
SPEAKING HIS ENGLISH WITH A MARKED BRITISH ACCENT. HE HAS 
TRAVELED OFTEN TO EASTERN EUROPE AND THE NEAR EAST IN THE 
SERVICE OF THE VATICAN AND IS A WELL-KNOWN FIGURE IN 
ARMENIAN AND GEORGIAN CHURCH CIRCLES, BOTH CATHOLIC AND 
ORTHODOX. IT IS UNUSUAL FOR A NON-CAREER VATICAN DIPLOMAT TO 
BE APPOINTED AS NUNCIO IN SUCH A STRATEGIC GEOGRAPHICAL 
AREA. GUGEROTTI AT 46 IS ALSO VERY YOUNG, ANOTHER TESTIMONY 
TO THE ESTEEM IN WHICH BOTH THE POPE AND SENIOR VATICAN 
OFFICIALS HOLD HIM. WITH THE CONSTANTLY EXPRESSED VATICAN 
HOPE FOR UNITY BETWEEN ROME AND THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES, 
GUGEROTTI\'S APPOINTMENT AS AMBASSADOR TO ARMENIA IN 
PARTICULAR AUGURS WELL FOR BRIGHTER, IF NOT POSITIVELY 
EFFERVESCENT ECUMENICAL RELATIONS WITH THE CONSEQUENT

SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON\'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 
 
 
OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 
 
REF: VATICAN 06036 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  06470  131632Z 
(A) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) AMBASSADOR PAID COURTESY CALL ON THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOG, 
CARDINAL FRANCIS ARINZE.  CARDINAL ARINZE IS ONE OF ONLY 
TWO BLACK AFRICANS IN THE ROMAN CURIA (REF).  THE 
CARDINAL DISCUSSED THE COUNCIL\'S COORDINATION OF DIALOG 
WITH ALL NON-CHRISTIAN RELIGIONS.  THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS 
DIALOG WITH THE JEWISH COMMUNITY, WHICH ALONG WITH NON- 
CATHOLIC CHRISTAN DENOMINATIONS, IS CONDUCTED BY THE 
COUNCIL FOR CHRISTAN UNITY.  ARINZE FURTHER EXPLAINED 
THAT THE COUNCIL GREW OUT OF THE SECOND VATICAN COUNCIL 
IN WHICH IT WAS DECIDED TO TRY TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER 
RELIGIOUS BODIES TO FOSTER BETTER UNDERSTANDING BY 
EMPHASIZING WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON, AND HOW THEY CAN 
BETTER SERVE MANKIND JOINTLY. 
 
2. (C) CARDINAL ARINZE\'S BIGGEST ACCOUNT IS DIALOG WITH 
THE MUSLIMS.  THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, WITH 18% OF THE 
WORLD\'S POPULATION, IS THE SECOND LARGEST WORLD RELIGION 
AFTER CHRISTIANITY WHICH COMPOSES 33%. HE STATED THAT TWO 
AREAS IN WHICH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WISHES TO CHANGE 
CURRENT MUSLIM THINKING IS THAT OF 1)EDUCATION AND 
2)RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THE VATICAN IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE MUSLIM RELIGIOUS EDUCATION SYSTEM WHICH PORTRAYS 
CHRISTIANS AS THE \"ENEMY\"; AND WITH THE LACK OF RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM IN MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES. 
3. (C) THE CARDINAL USED THE OCCASION TO AGAIN EXPRESS 
HIS CONDOLENCES FOR THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK.  HE SAID IT 
WOULD BE A \"DISASTER\" IF THE CONCEPT OF HUNTINQTON\'S 
\"CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS\" WERE TO BECOME A REALITY.  HE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  06470  131632Z 
WENT ON TO STATE, HOWEVER, THAT THE U.S. MUST REALIZE 
THAT IF THE PALESTINIAN/ISRAELI CONFLICT WERE SETTLED AND 
IF THE EMBARQO AQAINST IRAQ WERE LIFTED, MUCH OF THE 
AQENDA OF THE FUNDAMENTALISTS WOULD \"EVAPORATE\".  THE 
AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE 
EMBARQO ON SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S REQIME.  THE CARDINAL REPLIED 
THAT EVEN IF THE CASE HAS MERIT, THE IMAQES IN WHICH THE 
MUSLIM WORLD SEES ARE THOSE OF \"DYING BABIES\", DUE TO 
HARD-HEARTED, MEAN AMERICANS. 
 
4. (C) CARDINAL ARINZE SPOKE BRIEFLY ABOUT HIS COUNCIL\'S 
ROLE IN ORGANIZING THE JANUARY 24 INTER-RELIGIOUS 
CONFERENCE IN ASSISI.  HE SAID THAT HE EXPECTED 
APPROXIMATELY 50 U.S. RELIQIOUS LEADERS TO BE INVITED. 
THE AMBASSADOR REQUESTED THAT HE SHARE THE INVITATION 
LIST WITH THE EMBASSY AS SOON AS IT IS FINALIZED. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: THE JANUARY 24 CONFERENCE, ALTHOUGH 
OSTENSIBLY A RELIGIOUS CONFERENCE, HAS THE POTENTIAL OF 
PRODUCING POLITICAL STATEMENTS.  IT IS LIKELY THAT ONE 
SUCH STATEMENT WILL BE A CONDEMNATION OF THE EMBARQO IN 
IRAQ.  POST WILL MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS LEADINQ TO THE 
CONFERENCE, AS WELL AS ATTEND IN AN OBSERVER CAPACITY.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH VATICAN CHINA EXPERT 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR R.J. NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 
(A) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON CALLED ON ARCHBISHOP MARIA CELLI, 
SECRETARY OF THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE PATRIMONY OF THE 
 
SIPDIS 
APOSTOLIC SEE, ON DECEMBER 14.  ALTHOUGH CELLI, IN HIS 
CURRENT POSITION AS CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR OF VATICAN PROPERTIES 
DOES NOT HAVE A DIRECT FOREIGN POLICY ROLE, HE IS OFTEN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  06539  191519Z 
CALLED UPON BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY TO ADVISE AND ASSIST ON 
CHINA POLICY. 
 
2. (C) CELLI SAID THAT THE VATICAN ACCEPTS THAT THERE WILL BE 
NO IMPROVEMENT IN CHINA/VATICAN RELATIONS UNTIL AT LEAST THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS IN MARCH, 2002.  THE CURRENT 
DIRECTOR OF THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS BUREAU IN BEIJING IS AN 
\"OLD MAOIST\".  ACCORDING TO CELLI, THE POWER OF THE RELIGIOUS 
AFFAIRS BUREAU IS A MAJOR REASON THAT BEIJING REFUSES TO 
BEGIN DISCUSSIONS ON NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.  CELLI 
EXPLAINED THAT THE BUREAU IS A MAJOR BUREAUCRACY WHICH IS 
FIGHTING HARD TO PROTECT ITS POWER, PERKS, AND PERSONNEL. THE 
HEAD OF THE PATRIOTIC CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE BISHOP OF BEIJING, 
IS COMPLACENT WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION AND HE TOO DEPENDS 
ON THE BUREAU FOR HIS POWER AND POSITION. 
 
3. (C) AMBASSADOR ASKED IF THE POPE\'S RECENT OVERTURE TO 
BEIJING HAS HAD ANY EFFECT.  CELLI REPLIED THAT THE VATICAN 
IS NOW ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOT.  HE WENT ON TO SAY 
THAT CHINA IS A \"BIRD CAGE\" AND THAT THE VATICAN\'S GOAL IS 
NOT TO BREAK DOWN THE \"CAGE\" BUT TO WIDEN IT.  THE VATICAN 
DOES NOT EXPECT FULL FREEDOM OF RELIGION IN CHINA ANY TIME IN 
THE NEAR FUTURE, AND IS THEREFORE WILLING TO ACCEPT A 
\"DECENT\" LEVEL.  THE AMBASSADOR INQUIRED IF VATICAN RELATIONS 
WITH TAIWAN IS AN OBSTACLE TO NORMALIZATION.  CELLI SAID THAT 
BEIJING KNOWS \"PERFECTLY WELL\" THAT TAIWAN IS NOT AN ISSUE. 
ACCORDING TO CELLI, BEJING USES THE TAIWAN ISSUE AS AN EXCUSE 
TO PREVENT DISCUSSION ON THE REAL ISSUE-- THE RIGHT OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH TO NAME ITS OWN BISHOPS. 
 
4. (C) CELLI SAID THAT THE VATICAN KNOWS PRESIDENT BUSH MADE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  06539  191519Z 
AN INTERVENTION ON ITS BEHALF IN SHANGHAI, AND THAT IT IS 
VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.  THIS TYPE OF HELP IS NEEDED AS THE 
CATHOLIC COMMUNITY IN CHINA IS SUFFERING.  CELLI POINTED TO 
THE FACT THAT WITHIN FIVE OR SIX YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF THE 
ELDERLY BISHOPS WILL PROBABLY DIE.  AS THERE WAS A LONG 
PERIOD IN WHICH THERE WERE NO ORDINATIONS OF PRIESTS AND 
BISHOPS, THESE DYING BISHOPS WILL BE REPLACED BY VERY YOUNG, 
INEXPERIENCED CHURCHMEN.  THUS, THE VATICAN\'S GOAL IS TO 
NORMALIZE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH BEIJING BEFORE THIS OCCURS. 
THIS WOULD ALLOW THE VATICAN TO GUIDE THE TRANSITION. 
 
5. (C) AMBASSADOR ASKED CELLI FOR HIS VIEWS ON VIETNAM. 
CELLI SAID THAT HE IS NO LONGER INVOLVED ON THE VIETNAM 
ISSUE.  THAT SAID, HE BELIEVED THAT THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY 
WAS SOMEWHAT IMPROVED THAN WHEN HE WAS LAST THERE FIVE YEARS 
AGO.  AT THAT TIME, HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO VISIT ANY CATHOLIC 
CHURCHES IN HANOI. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT:  THE VATICAN IS RESIGNED TO THE FACT THAT THE 
POPE\'S OVERTURE IN OCTOBER FELL ON DEAF EARS.  IT IS NOW 
WAITING UNTIL AFTER MARCH TO RESUME ITS DIPLOMATIC PUSH.  IT 
IS LIKELY FOR THE VATICAN TO MAKE SOME CONCESSIONS TO BEIJING 
TO REESTABLISH ITSELF BEFORE THE END OF THIS DECADE.

1.  (C)  SUMMARY: S/E DANFORTH AND DELEGATION 
DISCUSSED STRATEGIES FOR MOVING FORWARD SUDAN PEACE 
PROCESS 12/20 WITH SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY AFRICA 
SPECIALISTS FABIO RICCARDI AND DON MATTEO ZUPPI. 
RICCARDI PROPOSED CONFIDENTIAL TALKS BETWEEN 
TRUSTED SENIOR GOS AND SPLM REPRESENTATIVES AT A 
LOCATION OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT, PERHAPS AT 
SANT\'EGIDIO\'S HEADQUARTERS.  DANFORTH AND GROUP 
TOOK SUGGESTION ON BOARD WITHOUT MAKING ANY 
COMMITMENTS. LATER MEETING WITH VATICAN FM TAURAN, 
S/E BRIEFED ON HIS SUDAN MISSION, AND TAURAN 
EXPLAINED VATICAN VIEW OF SUDAN AS THREAT TO 
CHRISTIANITY IN AFRICA.  END SUMMARY. 
2.  (C)  S/E DANFORTH, ACCOMPANIED BY AMBASSADOR 
ROBERT OAKLEY, AF/E JEFF MILLINGTON AND SUDAN DESK 
OFFICER RAAD VISITED SANT\'EGIDIO HEADQUARTERS IN 
ROME 12/20 ACCOMPANIED BY AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON AND 
EMBASSY VATICAN OFFICERS.  S/E DANFORTH BRIEFED THE 
SANT\'EGIDIO REPS ON HIS RECENT VISIT TO THE REGION, 
UNDERSCORING THE FOUR POINTS HE HAD PROPOSED AS 
CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES.  HE SAID HE WAS 
STRUCK THAT PEOPLE IN THE GOS ARE ALMOST 
PATHOLOGICALLY DISHONEST.  AS IN REFTEL, 
SANT\'EGIDIO\'S SUDAN SPECIALIST, FABIO RICCARDI, 
PRESENTED HIS IDEA OF A CONFIDENTIAL OFF-SITE 
MEDIATION TO MOVE THE SUDAN PEACE PROCESS FORWARD. 
 
3.  (C)  RICCARDI AGREED WITH S/E DANFORTH THAT THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  06604  01 OF 02  271651Z 
GOS TOO OFTEN WILL MAKE ASSURANCES THAT IT HAS NO 
INTENTION OF KEEPING.  HE SAID THAT THE U.S. NOW 
HAS STRONG CARDS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GOS WISHES 
AFTER SEPTEMBER 11 TO PROVE IT\'S ANTI-TERRORIST 
BONAFIDES AND, MOREOVER, USE ITS PROSPECTIVE OIL 
WEALTH TO BRING THE COUNTRY MORE FULLY INTO THE 
COMMUNITY OF NATIONS.  THEY WOULDN\'T BE ABLE TO DO 
THAT SO LONG AS THEY HAVE AN ACTIVE INSURGENCY TO 
WHICH THEY REACT BY BOMBING CIVILIANS.  RICCARDI 
SAID GARANG IS PERPETUATING THE CONFLICT BY 
SUSTAINING MILITARY PRESSURE ON THE GOS.  HE 
WONDERED WHETHER GARANG HAS IT IN HIMSELF TO STOP 
THE FIGHTING.  HE SHARED MILLINGTON\'S FEAR THAT 
GARANG, LIVING COMFORTABLY OUTSIDE OF SUDAN, MAY BE 
HAPPY TO SEE THE FIGHTING CONTINUE INDEFINITELY. 
 
4.  (C)  RICCARDI CONTINUED THAT DURING HIS RECENT 
KHARTOUM VISIT HE HAD DISCUSSED HIS IDEA OF DIRECT 
AND CONFIDENTIAL TALKS AT SANT\'EGIDIO\'S ROME 
HEADQUARTERS WITH SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE GOS, WHO 
ENDORSED IT IN PRINCIPAL.   HE SOUGHT USG HELP TO 
PERSUADE SPLM LEADER GARANG TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL. 
IN RESPONSE TO MILLINGTON\'S CONCERN THAT THE 
PARTIES MIGHT USE SUCH A PROCESS TO CUT A DEAL 
BETWEEN THEMSELVES THAT WOULDN\'T RESPECT THE 
PRINCIPLES SUCH AS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM INHERENT IN 
IGAD, RICCARDI SAID THAT THAT IS WHY THERE WAS NEED 
FOR A MEDIATOR.  SANT\'EGIDIO COULD BE COUNTED ON TO 
ENSURE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT THAT THOSE PRINCIPLES 
ARE MADE PART OF THE MEDIATION.  IN RESPONSE TO S/E 
DANFORTH\'S QUERY, RICCARDI CLARIFIED THAT HE WAS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  06604  01 OF 02  271651Z 
PROPOSING BACK-CHANNEL TALKS TOWARDS A POLITICAL 
ARRANGEMENT FOR GARANG AND THE SPLM/SPLA TO HAVE A 
ROLE IN A POST-CONFLICT GOS. 
 
5.  (C)  DON MATTEO INTERJECTED THAT WHAT WAS 
NEEDED WAS A FRAMEWORK BOTH TO ENGAGE GARANG AND TO 
PROTECT HIM FROM BECOMING CO-OPTED BY THE GOS 
WITHOUT OBTAINING ANY REAL FREEDOMS FOR HIS PEOPLE. 
IGAD COULD BE THE FRAMEWORK FOR A FINAL AGREEMENT, 
BUT A MEDIATED CONFIDENTIAL NEGOTIATION WOULD BE 
NECESSARY TO ELICIT CONCRETE ELEMENTS OF THE 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE WARRING SIDES.  THE TALKS 
SHOULD NOT BE BETWEEN AL-BASHIR AND GARANG, BUT 
BETWEEN TRUSTED SENIOR LIEUTENANTS -- ASSUMING WE 
CAN OVERCOME GARANG\'S MISTRUST OF HIS LIEUTENANTS. 
WE SHOULDN\'T EXPECT QUICK RESULTS EITHER; THE 
MOZAMBIQUE TALKS WENT ON FOR OVER TWO YEARS, THE 
FIRST YEAR OF WHICH WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE TWO SIDES 
TO BEGIN TO BUILD TRUST. 
 
6.  (C) RICCARDI THOUGHT THAT GARANG HIMSELF COULD 
PARTICIPATE IF, IN THE END, NOBODY ELSE COULD BE 
IDENTIFIED TO NEGOTIATE FOR THE SPLM.  RICCARDI 
SAID THAT FOR THIS FORMULA TO WORK, GARANG MUST BE 
PERSUADED THAT MOVING FORWARD DOESN\'T THREATEN HIM. 
RICCARDI BELIEVED THAT THE U.S. HAS STRONG 
INFLUENCE OVER GARANG; IF THE USG URGED HIM TO 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SAID THE GOS WAS NOT TO BE TRUSTED -- IT THREATENED 
FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  MOREOVER, HE 
IMPLIED, THE CONFLICT IN SUDAN WAS EMBLEMATIC OF A 
BROADER STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY 
ACROSS THE AFRICAN CONTINENT.  (NOTE: A SIMILAR 
VIEW WAS EXPRESSED TO AMBASSADOR EARLIER IN THE 
WEEK, DURING A VISIT WITH CARDINAL SEPE, PRESIDENT 
OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE PROPAGATION OF 
THE FAITH -- THE VATICAN\'S MISSIONARY 
ORGANIZATION).

PRESIDENT CARDINAL WALTER KASPER. KASPER WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT 
A CATHOLIC-JEWISH COMMISSION OF LAY HISTORIANS WOULD BE 
RE-FORMED WITH A CLEAR MANDATE AND WOULD BE ABLE TO CONDUCT A 
SERIOUS EXAMINATION OF THE TWELVE-VOLUME WORK ON PIUS XII\'S 
PAPACY, BUT NOT OF THE ARCHIVE ITSELF.  HE SAID THE FAILURE 
OF THE PREVIOUS COMMISSION DID NOT MEAN CATHOLIC-JEWISH 
DIALOGUE HAD FAILED. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) DURING A 12/18 COURTESY CALL ON PRESIDENT OF THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR PROMOTION OF CHRISTIAN UNITY 
(PROPAGANDA FIDES) CARDINAL WALTER KASPER, CONVERSATION 
FOCUSED ON CATHOLIC-JEWISH DIALOGUE.  (NOTE: KASPER EXPLAINED 
THAT PROPAGANDA FIDES, AS OPPOSED TO THE COMMISSION 
RESPONSIBLE FOR INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE, HAS COMPETENCY IN 
THIS AREA BECAUSE CHRISTIANS AND JEWS SHARE THE OLD 
TESTAMENT).  THE AMBASSADOR RECALLED THAT THE CATHOLIC-JEWISH 
COMMISSION LOOKING AT THE ROLE OF PIUS XII DURING WORLD WAR 
II HAD DISSOLVED IN AMID SOME ACRIMONY, AND THAT THERE WAS 
INTEREST IN THE UNITED STATES ABOUT WHETHER IT WOULD BE 
RE-FORMED.  KASPER REPLIED THAT THE FAILURE OF THE COMMISSION 
DID NOT REPRESENT THE FAILURE OF DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE 
CATHOLIC AND JEWISH FAITHS.  HE LAID THE COMMISSION\'S FAILURE 
TO PERSONALITY PROBLEMS AND TO LACK OF CLARITY ON ITS MANDATE 
(WHICH THE VATICAN MAINTAINS WAS ONLY TO REVIEW THE EXISTING 
12-VOLUME HISTORY OF PIUS XII AND NOT TO EXPLORING THE 
VATICAN ARCHIVES).  HE SAID THAT FATHER GUMPEL (REFTEL) WAS 
THE VATICAN\'S BEST INFORMED LIVING EXPERT ON THE PAPACY OF 
PIUS XII, AND THAT THEY HAD TURNED TO HIM TO ANSWER THE

NOTE.) 
 
3.  (C)  KASPER WAS HOPEFUL THAT A DECISION WOULD BE TAKEN 
SOON TO BEGIN EXPLORING RE-FORMING A COMMISSION OF HIGHLY 
QUALIFIED ACADEMICS NOT DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH OR \"JEWISH AGENCIES\" TO EXPLORE THE TWELVE 
VOLUMES ON THE PAPACY OF PIUS XII.  HE PREFERRED A BIGGER 
INTERNATIONAL GROUP THAT COULD INCLUDE ACADEMIC EXPERTS FROM 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.  IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY, 
KASPER SAID A BODY CONSISTING OF EXPERTS FROM CATHOLIC AND 
JEWISH UNIVERSITIES COULD BE CREATED TO NOMINATE THE ACADEMIC 
EXPERTS THAT WOULD COMPRISE THE COMMISSION.   HE WOULD LOOK 
FOR MOVEMENT ON THIS ISSUE SOME TIME IN 2002.  AS FOR THE 
ARCHIVES, HE SAID THAT THE VATICAN WOULD SEEK TO SPEED UP THE 
CATALOGUING OF DOCUMENTS FROM PIUS XII\'S PAPACY, BUT HE GAVE 
NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE BEFORE SOME YEARS 
HAVE PASSED. 
 
4.  (C)  KASPER AVERRED THAT THE CRITICISM OF PIUS XII AS 
PRO-NAZI WAS WITHOUT FOUNDATION, AND THAT THE ARCHIVES WOULD 
EVENTUALLY BEAR THIS OUT.  THERE WAS NO SMOKING GUN.  HE 
POINTED TO THE NEAR-UNANIMOUS PRAISE FROM JEWS (INCLUDING 
GOLDA MEIR) FOR THE POPE IN THE EARLY POST-WAR YEARS, AND 
SAID IT WAS ONLY AFTER REVISIONIST HISTORIANS BEGAN 
PUBLISHING IN THE 1960S THAT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY \"BECAME 
OBSESSED\" WITH WHAT PIUS XII DID OR DID NOT DO DURING THE 
WAR.  KASPER, WHO HAD BEEN A CHILD IN NAZI GERMANY, RECALLED 
THAT DURING THAT TIME THE POPE, FEARING THAT OTHERS WOULD 
SUFFER REPERCUSSIONS FOR THINGS HE MIGHT SAY, COMMUNICATED 
SUBTLY BUT CLEARLY HIS OPPOSITION TO NAZISM.  KASPER SAID 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  06619  310931Z 
\"EVERYBODY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT.\"  MOREOVER, KASPER 
SAID, \"THE CONVENTS ALL AROUND HERE (ROME) WERE FULL OF JEWS, 
AT GREAT RISK, EVEN THOUGH THE SS WAS IN THIS VERY BUILDING\" 
(REFERRING TO THE APOSTOLIC PALACE.)  HE SAID JEWISH 
ATTITUDES TOWARD PIUS XII TOOK A NEGATIVE TURN ONLY AFTER THE 
DEBUT OF THE PLAY \"THE DEPUTY\" IN THE 1960S. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT:  CLEARLY THE VATICAN REMAINS HIGHLY 
SENSITIVE TO CRITICISM OF PIUS XII, A POPE THEY ARE ACTIVELY 
SEEKING TO CANONIZE.   KASPER  SEEMS TO US A REALIST, AND 
WILL WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO RESOLVE DIFFERENCES THAT AROSE 
OVER THE CATHOLIC-JEWISH COMMISSION.  THE ARCHIVE WILL BE A 
HARD NUT TO CRACK.  VATICAN SOURCES CONSISTENTLY TELL US THAT 
IT WILL REMAIN OFF-LIMITS UNTIL IT IS PROPERLY CATALOGUED. 
TO ARGUMENTS THAT THE USG HAS DECLASSIFIED A MILLION PAGES OF 
RELEVANT HOLOCAUST ERA DOCUMENTS, THEY RESPOND THAT THEY DID 
THAT AND MORE WHEN THE JESUITS PUBLISHED THE TWELVE VOLUME 
SERIES CULLED FROM THE PIUS XII ARCHIVE.  TO THEM, TO ASK 
MORE NOW IS UNREASONABLE.

1.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS \"BLESSED\" THE ARRIVAL OF THE EURO 
CURRENCY CALLING IT AN HISTORIC STEP. IN A JANUARY 1 ADDRESS 
IN VATICAN CITY, THE POPE SAID HE WISHED PEACE AND 
PROSPERITY ON THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. HE SAID, 
\"I HOPE THAT IT (THE EURO) PROMOTES THE COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT 
OF THE CITIZENS OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES.\" 
 
2.   VATICAN CITY STATE HAS CHOSEN TO ADOPT THE EURO AS ITS 
CURRENCY. A 1930 ACCORD WITH ITALY, CONFIRMED IN 1998 BY THE 
EUROPEAN UNION\'S MONETARY COMMITTEE, ALLOWS IT TO COIN EUROS 
BUT NOT TO PRINT BANK NOTES. THE ITALIAN TREASURY\'S MINT IS 
CHARGED WITH PRODUCING THE EURO COINS WHICH, SIMILAR TO 
OTHER EUROPEAN STATES WITH A MONARCHY, WILL BEAR THE IMAGE 
OF POPE JOHN PAUL II AS SOVEREIGN HEAD OF VATICAN CITY 
STATE. WHILE THE EURO BECAME LEGAL TENDER ON JANUARY 1 2002, 
BECAUSE OF TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THE VATICAN EDITION OF THE 
COINS WILL REPORTEDLY ONLY BECOME AVAILABLE IN FEBRUARY. IN

3.   COMMENT: THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO IS ACTIVELY 
SUPPORTED BY THE VATICAN BUT FOR POLITICAL RATHER THAN 
ECONOMIC REASONS. THE VATICAN\'S FINANCE MINISTER, CARDINAL 
SERGIO SEBASTIANI HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT THE EURO CAN BE 
SEEN AS A KIND OF GUIDING STAR FOR EUROPE \"SO THAT IT CAN 
OVERCOME THE BARRIERS OF PAST DIVISIONS AND BECOME A 
STIMULUS FOR GREATER UNITY AMONG THE NATIONS.\" THROUGHOUT 
HIS PONTIFICATE POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS CONSISTENTLY PREACHED 
HIS VISION OF A CHRISTIAN EUROPE STRETCHING FROM THE

PORTUGUESE SPEAKER WITH LONG EXPERIENCE IN AFRICA, HAS BEEN

INDICATED TO HIM DURING A PHONE CONVERSATION TWO WEEKS BEFORE 
CHRISTMAS THAT UNITA, AS A CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE, WOULD 
OFFER A UNILATERAL THREE-MONTH CEASEFIRE STARTING AROUND 
CHRISTMAS.  ACCORDING TO ZUPPI, SAVIMBI ONLY NEEDED TO

2.  (C)  ZUPPI SAID HE LATER SPOKE WITH THE UNITA 
REPRESENTATIVE IN ROME, WHO TOLD HIM THAT IN A PRE-CHRISTMAS 
TELEVISION INTERVIEW ANGOLAN PRESIDENT CHISSANO HAD MADE 
SCATHING REMARKS ABOUT DRIVING THE UNITA REBELS INTO THE SEA, 
THUS MAKING SAVIMBI\'S OFFER HARDER TO CARRY OUT.  ZUPPI 
SPECULATED THAT BOTH CHISSANO AND SAVIMBI WERE MORE 
\"PRIMITIVE\" THAN HAD BEEN HIS INTERLOCUTORS IN MOZAMBIQUE, 
AND THAT THEIR RHETORIC FREQUENTLY HAMPERS MOVEMENT TOWARD A 
PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, MATTEO AVERRED, WITH A

SUBJECT: ANGELO SCOLA: NEW PATRIARCH AND NOW PAPABILE? 
 
 
1.   (SBU) POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS APPOINTED A NEW PATRIARCH 
TO LEAD THE CATHOLIC ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION OF VENICE, 
ITALY. 60 YEAR OLD BISHOP ANGELO SCOLA IS ALREADY BEING 
TOUTED AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE NEXT PAPACY. VENICE HAS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00076  071456Z 
PRODUCED THREE RECENT POPES WHO WERE PATRIARCHS PRIOR TO 
ELECTION - PIUS X, JOHN XXIII, AND JOHN PAUL I. SCOLA\'S 
APPOINTMENT TO VENICE IS A SIGN OF THE PRESENT PONTIFF\'S 
GREAT ESTEEM FOR THE NEW PATRIARCH. IT REPRESENTS A 
CONSOLIDATION OF THE CONSERVATIVE BLOC WITHIN THE ITALIAN 
BISHOPS CONFERENCE AND ENHANCES THE CHANCE OF AN ITALIAN 
EVENTUALLY REPLACING JOHN PAUL II. 
 
2.   (SBU) BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION: ANGELO SCOLA WAS BORN 
NOVEMBER 7, 1941 IN MALGRATE, ITALY. AFTER OBTAINING A 
DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY FROM THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF THE 
SACRED HEART IN MILAN, HE BEGAN HIS THEOLOGICAL STUDIES AT 
SEMINARIES IN SARONNO AND VENEGONO, EVENTUALLY EARNING A 
DOCTORAL DEGREE IN THEOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF FRIBOURG 
IN SWITZERLAND. ACADEMICALLY BRILLIANT, SCOLA WAS ORDAINED A 
PRIEST ON JULY 18, 1970. HIS PRIESTLY CAREER INCLUDED 
UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSHIPS IN SWITZERLAND AND ITALY, 
CULMINATING WITH HIS APPOINTMENT IN 1995 AS RECTOR OF THE 
PONTIFICAL LATERAN UNIVERSITY IN ROME. SCOLA WAS APPOINTED 
BISHOP OF THE ITALIAN DIOCESE OF GROSETTO IN 1991, BUT 
REMAINED THERE A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME BEFORE MOVING ON TO 
THE LATERAN. HE HAS SERVED AS AN ADVISOR TO CARDINAL JOSEPH 
RATZINGER AT THE VATICAN OFFICE FOR DOCTRINAL ORTHODOXY. 
SCOLA IS COSMOPOLITAN, AFFABLE, INTELLIGENT, AND HAS A WARM 
AND FRIENDLY PERSONALITY. HE IS FIERCELY LOYAL TO POPE JOHN 
PAUL II AND THE TENETS OF CATHOLICISM BUT WITHOUT THE 
HANDICAP OF BEING A DEMAGOGUE - PREFERRING TO ENGAGE OTHERS 
BY REASON AND DIALOGUE 
 
3.   (SBU) COMMENT: SCOLA\'S APPOINTMENT TO VENICE IS ANOTHER 
STEP ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATED CAREER. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00076  071456Z 
THE FACT THAT HE IS THEOLOGICALLY AND POLITICALLY LINKED TO 
SUCH VATICAN ILLUMINATES AS SECRETARY OF STATE SODANO, 
ORTHODOXY CZAR RATZINGER, AND THE POPE\'S DEPUTY FOR THE 
DIOCESE OF ROME, RUINI AUGURS WELL FOR THE CENTRISTS AT THE 
NEXT PAPAL CONCLAVE. SCOLA\'S ROOTS IN THE COMMUNION AND 
LIBERATION MOVEMENT MAKE HIM A DARLING OF THE CONSERVATIVE 
SECULAR POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. 
IN THIS TWILIGHT ERA OF JOHN PAUL II\'S PONTIFICATE PATRIARCH 
SCOLA, THE POLYGLOT WITH A BRILLIANT THEOLOGICAL REPUTATION, 
WILL BE WORTH KEEPING AN EYE ON. END COMMENT. MERANTE

2.  (SBU)  THE INFORMATION POST HAS ON THIS ISSUE ALL COMES 
FROM A PACKET OF CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE ARCHDIOCESE OF 
NEW YORK AND OFAC (ALL FAXED TO EUR/WE).  THE BASIC FACTS 
ALLEGED ARE THAT THE ARCHDIOCESE ATTEMPTED ON JULY 5, 2001 
TO TRANSFER A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS OF A VATICAN 
INVESTMENT TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE HAVANA NUNCIATURE AT THE 
ISTITUTO PER LE OPERE RELIGIOSE (IOR -- THE VATICAN\'S

CORRESPONDENCE DETAILING PARTICULARS OF THE PROPOSED IOR 
TRANSACTION.  BY JANUARY 5,2002, WITH NO APPARENT ACTION ON 
THE PART OF OFAC, CARDINAL SODANO SENT THE NOTE AND LETTER 
REFERRED TO ABOVE. 
 
3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  THIS TRANSACTION HAS RISEN TO THE LEVEL

DIPLOMATIC ACCOUNTS.  SECOND, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN BLOCKED AS 
PART OF A SANCTIONS REGIME THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS RESOLUTELY 
OPPOSED SINCE ITS INCEPTION.  THIRD, BECAUSE THE IOR HAS IN

HIM THE PREVIOUS EVENING TO REPORT SAVIMBI\'S RESPONSE THAT 
UNITA WAS NOT CURRENTLY IN A POSITION TO PROPOSE A CEASEFIRE 
BECAUSE IT WAS UNDER \"FAIRLY SERIOUS\" ATTACK FROM GOS FORCES. 
 ZUPPI WAS GRATIFIED THAT SAVIMBI HAD NOT REJECTED THE NOTION

DAY OF ECUMENICAL PRAYER FOR PEACE SINCE 1986, IN RESPONSE TO 
THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS AND THE THREAT TO ECUMENISM FROM A

MEETING WILL BE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO GARNER SUBSTANTIAL 
INTERNATIONAL PRESS ATTENTION AND THUS WOULD PROVIDE A GOOD 
OPPORTUNITY TO UNITA TO OFFER THE GOS AND THE WORLD A STRONG 
SIGNAL OF ITS SERIOUSNESS AT OPENING A SEARCH FOR PEACE. 
ZUPPI ALSO CLARIFIED THAT IN HIS TALKS WITH SAVIMBI AND 
COSTA, THEY HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE LUSAKA PROCESS WAS

NOT SEEKING A PLACE ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL!\" 
 
3.  (SBU) COMMENT: SANT\'EGIDIO IS A RELIABLE INTERLOCUTOR OF 
THIS EMBASSY, AND ONE WHICH WE HAVE COLLABORATED WITH IN 
AREAS AS DIVERSE AS FUNDING ITS INTER-COMMUNAL EDUCATION 
EFFORTS IN KOSOVO AND SUPPORTING ITS EFFORTS A MEDIATING 
PEACE IN MOZAMBIQUE.  WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH 
SANT\'EGIDIO TO SEE WHETHER THEY MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE IN 
SUDAN.  WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT SANT\'EGIDIO HAS NEVER MADE 
A FALSE STEP -- ALGERIA BEING A CASE IN POINT.  IN THE MID- 
1990S SANT\'EGIDIO GOT INTO HOT WATER IN ALGERIA BY 
ORGANIZING A MEETING WITH ALGERIAN OPPOSITION WITHOUT 
COORDINATING ITS \"BOOTLEG DIPLOMACY\" EITHER WITH THE GOA OR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00173  111447Z 
THE HOLY SEE. BOTH REACTED NEGATIVELY, AND THE GOA SEEMS 
STILL TO WISH TO PUNISH SANT\'EGIDIO.  NEVERTHELESS, FROM 
WHERE WE SIT THE GROUP HAS DONE A LOT OF GOOD WORK; CLEARLY 
IT CAN CONTRIBUTE IN A POSITIVE FASHION TO THE WORK OF THE 
ECOSOC AND WE ENDORSE ITS CANDIDACY. 
 
4.  (SBU) ACTION REQUESTED:  PLEASE PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON HOW 
TO RESPOND TO SANT\'EGIDIO\'S REQUEST.

SUBJECT: PAPAL ADDRESS FOCUSES ON VIOLENCE, RESPONSIBILITY 
 
 
AND FORGIVENESS 
 
1.  IN HIS ANNUAL SPEECH TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, POPE JOHN 
PAUL II OFFERED HIS VERSION OF THE STATE OF THE WORLD, 
FOCUSING ON AREAS TRADITIONALLY OF CONCERN TO THE CHURCH. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00180  111548Z 
ESCHEWING FOR THE MOST PART HIS TRADITIONAL EXHORTATION FOR 
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO DO MORE FOR THE LESS FORTUNATE, IT 
STRUCK MANY THAT THE PONTIFF EXPRESSED A BALANCED AND 
REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT CONDITIONS AND A GENTLE 
PRESCRIPTION FOR THE FUTURE. 
 
2.  EARLY ON, HE OFFERED A COMMENTARY ON EU EXPANSION: HE 
SUPPORTS IT AND INDEED ENCOURAGES MORE, BUT ASSERTS THAT 
EVEN A SECULAR EUROPE MUST ALLOW RELIGIOUS VOICES TO HAVE A 
PLACE IN EU PLANNING -- ESPECIALLY IN THE UPCOMING 
DISCUSSIONS OF AN EU CONSTITUTION.  HE NOTED PROGRESS IN 
CYPRUS, KOSOVO AND SRI LANKA, AND CONGRATULATED BOTH THE 
PEOPLES REPUBLIC, AND THE REPUBLIC, OF CHINA FOR TAKING 
SEATS AT THE WTO. 
 
3.  ON THE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN CONFLICT HE DECRIED \"THE 
INJUSTICE OF WHICH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VICTIMS 
FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS.\"  HE ADDED THAT ONLY A HALT TO THE 
VIOLENCE AND \"RESPECT FOR OTHERS AND THEIR LEGITIMATE 
ASPIRATIONS, THE APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE 
WITHDRAWAL FROM OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, AND INTERNATIONALLY 
GUARANTEED STATUS FOR THE MOST HOLY PLACES IN JERUSALEM,..\" 
CAN BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE TO WHICH THERE IS APPARENTLY 
NO END.  ALL OF THE ABOVE IS STANDARD VATICAN LANGUAGE -- AS 
WAS HIS EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BE 
ACCEPTED BY ALL PARTIES TO TAKE A ROLE IN THE PEACE PROCESS. 
(NOTE: WE READ THIS TO INCLUDE COUNTRIES BESIDES THE U.S. IN 
THE PEACE PROCESS, TO INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL MONITORS.) 
 
4.  THE POPE REITERATED HIS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED 
STATES\' RIGHT TO \"LEGITIMATE DEFENSE\" AGAINST THE TERRORIST 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00180  111548Z 
ATTACKS OF 9/11.  NOTING THE NEED ALSO TO CONSIDER 
STRATEGIES TO COMBAT IT, ADDRESS CAUSAL FACTORS, AND BEGIN A 
HEALING PROCESS, HE OFFERED AN IMPLICIT ENDORSEMENT OF OUR 
CAMPAIGN BY SIMPLY URGING THE KARZAI GOVERNMENT TO MOVE 
QUICKLY TO \"PACIFY\" ALL OF AFGHANISTAN\'S TERRITORY. 
 
5.  THE PONTIFF RESERVED HIS MOST HARSH AND BLUNT CRITICISM 
FOR THOSE WHO WOULD COMMIT VIOLENCE IN THE NAME OF GOD.  HE 
CALLED THIS \"BLASPHEMY AND A PERVERSION OF RELIGION.\"   HE 
FURTHER DECRIED TERRORISM \"IN THE NAME OF GOD,\" AS A 
\"PROFANATION OF RELIGION.\" 
 
6.  TOWARDS THE END OF HIS TALK, THE PONTIFF OFFERED BRIEF 
COMMENTS ON THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT GAP.  UNLIKE IN PREVIOUS 
ANNUAL ADDRESSES, IN WHICH HE SOUGHT TO STIMULATE THE NORTH 
TO DO MORE FOR THE SOUTH, THIS TIME HE URGED THE POLITICAL 
CLASSES -- IN AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA ESPECIALLY -- TO SET 
ASIDE THEIR GREED AND PARTISAN DIFFERENCE AND TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR BETTERING THEIR OWN SITUATION. 
 
7.  IN CLOSING, THE PONTIFF OFFERED HIS INSIGHTS ON THE 
NATURE OF GOD AND MAN; HE UNDERSCORED THAT, ALONE AMONG THE 
MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONS, CHRISTIANITY OFFERS TO THE WORLD 
(AND TO ISLAM IN PARTICULAR) A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH -- THAT TO 
FORGIVE IS DIVINE.  HE HOPED THAT THE JANUARY 24 DAY OF 
PRAYER IN ASSISI WOULD BRING THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD\'S 
RELIGIOUS LEADERS TOGETHER AROUND THE MESSAGE THAT RELIGION 
SHOULD NOT, AND INDEED TODAY CANNOT, BE SPREAD BY FORCE OF 
ARMS.

REF: 01 VATICAN 1244 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.   VATICAN NGO, CARITAS HONG KONG, COORDINATES THE 
VATICAN\'S RELIEF EFFORTS IN NORTH KOREA. THE ORGANIZATION 
HAS A SOLID WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DPRK GOVERNMENT. 
CARITAS REPORTS IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FOOD SITUATION AFTER 
MASSIVE INPUTS FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING 
THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, CARITAS 
PROVIDED MORE THAN 20 MILLION DOLLARS OF FOOD, AGRICULTURAL 
AND DEVELOPMENT AID. ACCORDING TO CARITAS, NORTH KOREA\'S 
GOVERNMENT HAS PULLED BACK SOMEWHAT FROM ENGAGEMENT WITH THE 
OUTSIDE WORLD, IN PARTICULAR THE U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA, AND 
HAS REDUCED ITS INTERNAL PROPAGANDA RHETORIC. CARITAS IS 
COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING AN ACTIVE PRESENCE IN NORTH KOREA. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------- 
SITUATION UP-DATE 
----------------- 
 
2.   EMBASSY OFFICERS RECEIVED A SITUATION UPDATE JANUARY 10 
FROM CARITAS\' NORTH KOREAN AID COORDINATOR KATHI ZELLWEGER 
WHO LAST VISITED THE DPRK IN NOVEMBER 2001, HER FIFTH ENTRY 
FOR THAT YEAR. ACCORDING TO ZELLWEGER, \"PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON 
THE EDGE\" - THE POPULATION HAS ENOUGH FOOD TO SURVIVE BUT 
NOT ENOUGH TO LEAD A HEALTHY LIFE. FOOD SHORTAGES ARE 
PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN THE EASTERN COASTAL DISTRICTS WHERE 
ARABLE LAND IS AT A MINIMUM AND URBAN-BASED NORTH KOREANS DO 
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO PLOTS OF LAND FOR SUBSISTENCE GARDENING. 
CARITAS HONG KONG COORDINATES THE PROVISION OF FOOD INPUTS 
AND BASIC HEALTH CARE AT THE GRASS ROOTS LEVEL. (NOTE: 
CARITAS IS PART OF A FOOD AID LIAISON UNIT OPERATING OUT OF 
PYONGYANG. THE UNIT ALSO INCLUDES THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM. 
END NOTE). ZELLWEGER NOTED THAT NORTH KOREAN CHILDREN ARE 
STUNTED - A CLEAR SIGN OF CHRONIC MALNUTRITION. ZELLWEGER 
SAYS MASSIVE FOOD AID - ONE MILLION TONS IN 2001 - HAS HAD 
AN IMPACT FOR THE BETTER AND NO DEVASTATING FAMINE IS 
ENVISAGED. 
 
---------------------- 
ON THE POLITICAL SCENE 
---------------------- 
 
3.   ON THE POLITICAL SCENE, ZELLWEGER HAS NOTICED A 
REDUCTION IN PROPAGANDA RHETORIC COMING FROM THE GOVERNMENT. 
SHE EXPECTS THE SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE \"BELOVED LEADER\" TO 
BE CELEBRATED BY AN INCREASE IN FOOD RATIONS AND PERHAPS BY 
AN AMNESTY FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PRISONERS. ZELLWEGER 
OPINED THAT EXPECTATIONS RESULTING FROM THE \"SUNSHINE 
SUMMIT\" WERE OVER OPTIMISTIC. SHE BELIEVES FAMILY REUNIONS 
NEED TO BE REVIVED AS THE OLDER GENERATION IS DYING OUT AND 
YOUNGER SOUTH KOREANS ARE LOSING THEIR \"LINKS\" TO THE DPRK. 
ACCORDING TO ZELLWEGER, THE DPRK IS \"BACKING AWAY\" FROM 
SOUTH KOREA AND THE U.S. SHE CONSIDERS THE UP-COMING WORLD 
SOCCER CUP MEDIA COVERAGE MAY HAVE A POSITIVE SPIN OFF 
REFOCUSING PUBLIC ATTENTION TO NORTH KOREA\'S FOOD SHORTAGES 
AND RELATED ISSUES. ZELLWEGER SAYS PROTRACTED RELIEF 
OPERATIONS ARE NOT ATTRACTIVE TO POTENTIAL DONORS. 
 
---------------- 
CARITAS PROJECTS 
---------------- 
 
4.   CARITAS SPONSORED PROJECTS IN NORTH KOREA INCLUDE A 
CHILDREN\'S CLOTHING FACTORY PROVIDING WORK FOR WOMEN WHOSE 
SALARIES ARE PAID IN CASH AND FOOD. CARITAS ALSO SUPPORTS 
FISH FARMING - WORKING TO ENCOURAGE PRODUCTION INCREASES AND 
COOPERATIVE FARMS. CARITAS PROVIDES \"KITS\" TO FARMS 
CONTAINING TOOLS, SEEDS, MECHANICAL PARTS, FERTILIZERS AND 
PLASTIC SHEETING. ZELLWEGER SAID SOME OF THE COOPERATIVES 
HAVE A \"FREEDOM\" TO PLANT WHAT THEY WANT AND SO PRODUCE CASH 
CROPS SUCH AS TOBACCO. THE MONEY RAISED FROM CASH CROPS IS 
USED TO BUY OTHER ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL AS 
PROVIDING FOOD AID TO THE MOST VULNERABLE - WOMEN, CHILDREN, 
THE ELDERLY - CARITAS PROVIDES BASIC HEALTH CARE KITS. 
ZELLWEGER SAID THE HEALTH SYSTEM IS \"DISMAL\" AND THE ACUTE 
LACK OF SUPPLIES IS FRUSTRATING MEDICAL PERSONNEL. THE 
CARITAS HEALTH CARE KITS PROVIDE BASIC EQUIPMENT TO VILLAGE 
HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AS WELL AS A STABLE SUPPLY OF DRUGS - 
AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS. (NOTE: ZELLWEGER SAID THE WHO HAS AN 
OFFICE IN PYONGYANG BUT THAT IT IS \"DESPERATELY UNDER- 
FUNDED.\" END NOTE). 
 
5.   AN INDEPENDENT FIVE-YEAR REVIEW OF THEIR OPERATIONS 
CONDUCTED IN NOVEMBER 2001 RESULTED IN CARITAS COMMITTING TO 
STAY IN NORTH KOREA FOR THE LONG HAUL, HAVING ALREADY 
PROVIDED SOME 23 MILLION DOLLARS OF AID. FUTURE AID 
STRATEGIES WILL BUILD ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST SIX 
YEARS WITH FOOD AID, AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH AS THE MAIN 
SECTORS. THE MAIN GEOGRAPHICAL FOCUS WILL BE ON THE EAST 
COAST PROVINCES. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.    ZELLWEGER IS A USEFUL EMBASSY CONTACT AS HER REGULAR 
SOJOURNS INTO NORTH KOREA PROVIDE US WITH A GOOD ASSESSMENT 
OF THE HUMANITARIAN AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, POLITICAL 
SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. ZELLWEGER WILL BE IN WASHINGTON IN 
THE SPRING AND POST HOPES TO FACILITATE MEETINGS FOR HER 
WITH STATE AND NGO OFFICIALS. SHE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN 
MEETING WITH CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES, CARITAS\' U.S. BRANCH. 
END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: VATICAN REPORTS EYES ON GUANTANAMO 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR R. JAMES NICHOLSON REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C)  THE VATICAN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN DESK OFFICER 
ADVISED POLOFF 1/16 THAT U.S. TREATMENT OF DETAINEES AT THE 
GUANTANAMO BASE AND ELSEWHERE HAD BECOME A SALIENT QUESTION 
IN HIS VATICAN MEETINGS, BOTH IN-HOUSE AND WITH FOREIGN 
DIPLOMATS.  IN PARTICULAR, MSGR. LUIS MARIANO DE MONTEMAYOR, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00298  190706Z 
THE VATICAN DESK OFFICER, SPOKE REPEATEDLY OF CONVERSATIONS 
WITH A RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT AND REPUTED INTELLIGENCE ELEMENT, 
DMITRY SHTODIN.  MSGR. MONTEMAYOR RECOUNTED THAT THE RUSSIAN 
FEDERATION IS CAREFULLY STUDYING U.S. TREATMENT OF DETAINEES 
IN SEARCH OF USEFUL PRECEDENTS TO JUSTIFY ITS TREATMENT OF 
CHECHNYA PRISONERS. 
 
2.  (C)  MONTEMAYOR STATED THE ISSUE OF DETAINEE TREATMENT 
COULD ALSO GAIN PROMINENCE WITHIN THE VATICAN, WHERE A HEATED 
INTERNAL DEBATE ENDED IN SOLID VATICAN SUPPORT, WITH SOME 
RESERVATIONS, FOR THE U.S.-LED CAMPAIGN. MONTEMAYOR REPEATED 
EARLIER COMMENTS TO POLOFF THAT CERTAIN VATICAN VOICES, 
FEARING A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER IN THE MAKING, HAD LOBBIED 
FOR A VATICAN STANCE LESS AMENABLE TO THE U.S.  HE NOTED WITH 
SATISFACTION THAT, CONTRARY TO THE NAYSAYERS\' EXPECTATIONS, 
THE U.S. INTERVENTION HAD CLEARLY AMELIORATED HUMANITARIAN 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN AFGHANISTAN.  HOW THE USG RESOLVES TO TREAT 
THE GUANTANAMO DETAINEES MAY PROVE THE NEXT HURDLE FOR THE 
CURRENT CONSENSUS OF SUPPORT WITHIN THE VATICAN. (NOTE: 
MONTEMAYOR WAS PROBABLY REFERRING TO PEOPLE IN THE VATICAN\'S 
ASSISTANCE ARM -- COR UNUM -- WHICH HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN 
CRITICAL OF U.S. \"UNILATERALISM\"). 
 
3.  (C)  COMMENT: THE SON OF A SENIOR ARGENTINIAN NAVAL 
OFFICER, MONTEMAYOR HAS SAID IN THE PAST THAT HE AND HIS 
FAMILY LIVED UNDER THREAT AND WITH A PROTECTIVE POLICE 
DETAIL.  HIS ARGENTINE BACKGROUND APPEARS ESSENTIAL IN HIS 
HARSH JUDGMENTS OF EL-QAEDA TERRORISM.  INDEED, MONTEMAYOR 
RELATED HOW HIS RUSSIAN INTERLOCUTOR WAS TAKEN ABACK AT HIS 
QUOTE LACK OF TENDER FEELINGS END QUOTE TOWARD THE GUANTANAMO 
DETAINEES.  AS AN ARGENTINE, MONTEMAYOR FINDS THE U.S. TO BE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00298  190706Z 
IN FAMILIAR WATERS, LEGALLY AND ETHICALLY, IN ITS EVOLVING 
APPROACH TO THE GUANTANAMO DETAINEES AS WELL AS THE JOHN 
WALKER CASE.  WOULD ARGENTINA\'S ERSTWHILE MILITARY TRIBUNALS 
SOON SEE THEIR U.S. EQUIVALENT, HE WONDERED.

POINTS ON THE ZINNI MISSION AND TO ASK TAURAN TO REQUEST

SHIPMENT.  TAURAN, WHO IN THE PAST HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE 
PROPONENT OF THE HOLY SEE\'S \"TILT\" TOWARD THE PALESTINIANS 
AND OF VATICAN INTERESTS IN PROTECTING THE HOLY SITES IN 
JERUSALEM, TOOK THE POINTS ON BOARD, SAYING ARAFAT \"WILL HEAR

KNEW GEN. ZINNI.  (NOTE: WE TAKE ALL THIS TO MEAN A) THAT 
SOMEONE IN THE VATICAN WILL SPEAK DIRECTLY EITHER TO ARAFAT 
OR TO ONE OF HIS PEOPLE AND B) THE VATICAN WOULD BE

2. (U) IN THE MEANTIME, AT HIS WEEKLY ANGELUS MESSAGE THE 
POPE REFERRED TO THE \"DEAD END\" INTO WHICH THE CONFLICTING 
PARTIES HAVE FOUGHT THEMSELVES AND CALLED FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NOT TO ABANDON THEM TO THEIR FATE.

THE PALESTINIANS HAVE SUFFERED.

WOULD TURN NEXT TO IRAQ.  HIS DCM MET SEPARATELY ON THE SAME

FOR THE USG TO TAKE IT SLOW ON IRAQ -- AND SEE WHETHER WE 
COULD \"WAIT SADAAM OUT.\"

OWN INTERESTS IN THE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN CONFLICT (THE RIGHTS 
OF CHRISTIANS ABOVE ALL). BUT A FUNDAMENTAL VATICAN INTEREST 
IS SEEING AN END TO THE VIOLENCE COMMITTED AGAINST BOTH 
SIDES.  WITH THAT IN MIND WE REQUEST DEPARTMENT CONSIDER A 
ZINNI DROP BY DURING ONE OF HIS FUTURE VISITS TO THE REGION. 
WE BELIEVE THE POPE WOULD WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM DIRECTLY ABOUT 
POSSIBLE PATHS TO PEACE.  ON IRAQ, WE NOTE THAT THE VATICAN 
HAS NOT BEEN VOCAL ABOUT SANCTIONS IN RECENT WEEKS, INCLUDING 
DURING THE POPE\'S ANNUAL ADDRESS.  FROM THE VATICAN 
PERSPECTIVE, SANCTIONS ARE ALWAYS BAD; FAR WORSE, HOWEVER, 
WOULD BE A MILITARY STRIKE.  IF THE USG WERE TO INITIATE A 
BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN IRAQ, THE VATICAN WOULD MOVE FROM ITS 
FIRM SUPPORT OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO FAR IN AFGHANISTAN TO 
VIGOROUS AND PUBLIC OPPOSITION. END COMMENT.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON, REASONS 1.5 B. 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  POPE JOHN PAUL II LED AN INTERFAITH APPEAL 
FOR PEACE JANUARY 24 IN ASSISI, ITALY AT WHICH HE ISSUED A 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00521  01 OF 03  040621Z 
RINGING CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE PERPETRATED IN THE NAME OF 
RELIGION. MORE THAN 300 RELIGIOUS LEADERS ATTENDED FROM 
AROUND THE WORLD TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE PAPAL CALL FOR 
DIALOG AMONG RELIGIONS AND CULTURES.  THE MEETING, WHICH THE 
POPE CALLED IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE WORLD SITUATION 
POST-SEPTEMBER, INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF WESTERN AND 
NON-WESTERN RELIGIONS.  VATICAN-WATCHERS HIGHLIGHTED THE 
STRONG ORTHODOX PRESENCE. KEY MUSLIM PARTICIPANTS NUMBERED 
OVER THIRTY, INCLUDING A THEOLOGIAN FROM MECCA WHO SPOKE AT 
LENGTH WITH POLOFF.  THE ASSISI MEETING REPRESENTED THE 
CULMINATION OF RECENT VATICAN EFFORTS TO COMBAT PERCEPTIONS 
OF A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) THE JANUARY 24 ASSISI \"DAY OF PRAYER FOR PEACE IN THE 
WORLD\" WAS THE OCCASION FOR UNUSUAL ENCOUNTERS AND UNLIKELY 
DIALOGUE. SHARING CENTER STAGE WERE ZOROASTRIAN AND CATHOLIC, 
ANIMIST AND MUSLIM, BUDDHIST AND BAPTIST, JAINIST AND QUAKER, 
HINDU AND ORTHODOX, AND MANY OTHERS FROM SCORES OF 
DISTINCTIVE FAITH TRADITIONS.  AN ATTEMPT TO BRIDGE RELIGIOUS 
DIFFERENCES IN AN AFFIRMATION OF COMMON VALUES, THE ASSISI 
MEETING REPRESENTED AN ECUMENICAL AND INTERFAITH CAPSTONE FOR 
THE JOHN PAUL II PAPACY.  THE POPE\'S OWN CONDEMNATION OF WAR, 
TERRORISM, AND, MOST ESPECIALLY, VIOLENCE IN THE NAME OF 
RELIGION, FURTHER REPRESENTED A VERY PERSONAL RESPONSE TO THE 
GLOBAL CRISIS PRECIPITATED BY SEPTEMBER 11 (REF. 
 
3.  (U) THE POPE CONVOKED THE ASSISI GATHERING IN LATE 
NOVEMBER 2001 IN AN URGENT APPEAL FOR PEACE IN A WORLD 
WOUNDED BY WAR AND TERRORISM.  THE VATICAN HAD LITTLE 
LEAD-TIME TO MOUNT A COMPLEX OPERATION IN LOGISTICS AND 
PROTOCOL.  THE VATICAN HOWEVER IS A VETERAN HAND IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

ORCHESTRATING LARGE EVENTS, ESPECIALLY AFTER HANDLING THE 
MILLIONS OF PILGRIMS DURING THE JUBILEE YEAR.  MOREOVER, 
THERE WERE HELPFUL PRECEDENTS IN ASSISI ITSELF, WHICH HAD 
HOSTED LARGE INTERFAITH GATHERINGS IN 1982, 1986 AND 1993. 
 
4.  (U) IN 1982 POPE JOHN PAUL II LAUNCHED THE ASSISI 
MEETINGS WITH A LARGE-SCALE COMMEMORATION OF THE 700TH 
BIRTHDAY OF SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI, THE CELEBRATED UMBRIAN 
SAINT OF POVERTY AND PEACE (WHO ALSO TRIED HIS HAND AT 
DIPLOMACY WHEN HE TRAVELED TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO SEEK AN END 
TO THE CRUSADES).  IN 1986 THE POPE RETURNED TO ASSISI 
FLANKED BY MYRIAD RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN AN APPEAL TO END THE 
DANGEROUS DIVISIONS OF THE COLD WAR. IN 1993 JOHN PAUL II 
CONVOKED A SMALLER GATHERING IN ASSISI TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS 
IN THE BALKANS. THE 1986 MEETING IN PARTICULAR BECAME THE 
TOUCHSTONE FOR SUBSEQUENT VATICAN EFFORTS IN INTERFAITH 
RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL DIALOGUE. OTHER INTERFAITH 
GATHERINGS, NOTABLY UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE COMMUNITY OF 
SANT\'EGIDIO, INVARIABLY INVOKE THE SPIRIT OF THE 1986 MEETING 
IN ASSISI. 
 
ASSISI IN 2002: THE VATICAN TAKES ON THE CLASH OF 
CIVILIZATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (SBU) IN THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11 THE VATICAN HAS SOUGHT 
TO COUNTER PERCEPTIONS OF A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS. ITS 
SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.-LED CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM HAS 
CONSISTENTLY BEEN TEMPERED BY EFFORTS TO DEFUSE ANY RELIGIOUS 
ASPECT TO THE CONFLICT. EVEN AS VATICAN OFFICIALS LAUDED

PRESIDENT BUSH\'S OUTREACH TO ISLAM AND HIS VISIT TO AN 
AMERICAN MOSQUE, THE VATICAN HAS BEEN PURSUING ITS OWN 
PROGRAM OF OUTREACH TO MUSLIM LEADERSHIP.  IN SEPTEMBER A 
VATICAN DELEGATION (THAT INCLUDED AN AMERICAN WOMAN WITH A 
VATICAN PASSPORT) TRAVELED TO TEHERAN TO CONTINUE THE 
\"DIALOGUE OF CIVILIZATIONS\" BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND IRAN. 
IN LATE OCTOBER THE VATICAN AND THE AL-AZHAR ISLAMIC 
UNIVERSITY IN CAIRO MOVED FORWARD THEIR SCHEDULED CALENDAR OF 
MEETINGS IN ORDER TO PRESS QUIET YET TIMELY INTERFAITH 
DISCUSSIONS. IN NOVEMBER POPE JOHN PAUL II CALLED ON 
CATHOLICS TO FAST FOR PEACE ON DECEMBER 14 -- THE LAST DAY OF 
RAMADAN -- FORGING AN UNPRECEDENTED IF SHORT-LIVED MOMENT 
SHARED BETWEEN THE TWO FAITHS.  AND IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS THE 
POPE, WITH INCREASING EMPHASIS, HAS CONDEMNED VIOLENCE

THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORISTS AND BIN LADEN FROM THE ACCEPTED 
FAMILY OF BELIEVERS.  \"THERE IS NO RELIGIOUS GOAL WHICH 
POSSIBLY CAN JUSTIFY THE USE OF VIOLENCE BY MAN AGAINST MAN,\" 
THE POPE REITERATED IN ASSISI, IN THE PRESENCE OF SOME THIRTY 
MUSLIM RELIGIOUS LEADERS.

6.  (SBU) WHILE THE POPE\'S OWN ASSISI PROCLAMATION \"VIOLENCE 
NEVER AGAIN!  WAR NEVER AGAIN!  TERRORISM NEVER AGAIN!\" 
DOMINATED THE HEADLINES, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF INTERVENTIONS 
READ BY OR ON BEHALF OF LEADERS OF DIFFERENT FAITHS, CREEDS, 
AND DENOMINATIONS. EACH STATEMENT HAD ITS OWN ACCENT AND 
IDENTITY, WITH NO EVIDENT PLOYS FOR SECTARIAN OR ETHNIC 
ADVANTAGE. SHEIK MOHAMMED AL-TANTAWI, HEAD OF CAIRO\'S 
AL-AZHAR MOSQUE, WAS ABSENT, YET SENT A DECLARATION READ BY A 
REPRESENTATIVE.  THE STATEMENT, A COMMITMENT TO THE 
IMPORTANCE OF DIALOGUE, DID RAISE EYEBROWS HOWEVER, LAUDING 
POPE JOHN PAUL II AS A CHAMPION OF PALESTINIANS AND OMITTING 
ANY MENTION OF JUDAISM OR THE RABBINICAL PRESENCE ON STAGE. 
YET FOR THE VATICAN INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS COUNTED LESS THAN 
THE FACT AND WITNESS OF EACH LEADER\'S PRESENCE, NOTABLY THE 
MUSLIM AND ORTHODOX REPRESENTATIVES.  \"THE VERY FACT THAT WE 
ARE LISTENING TO ONE ANOTHER,\" THE POPE SAID, \"IS A SIGN OF 
PEACE.\" 
 
THE SECOND FRONT: ADVANCING RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE ORTHODOX. 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7.  (U) THE ASSISI ENCOUNTER INCLUDED A HOST OF ORTHODOX 
PATRIARCHS, THUS MARKING A KEY STEP FORWARD IN THE VATICAN\'S 
OUTREACH TO EASTERN CHRISTIANITY. THE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH OF 
CONSTANTINOPLE, BARTHOLOMEW, WHO HAS MET THE POPE SEVERAL 
TIMES, LENT LEGITIMACY AMONG ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS TO THE 
GATHERING.  THE TRUE WATERSHED HOWEVER WAS THE PRESENCE OF 
THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH\'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, 
METROPOLITAN PITRIM.   VATICAN WATCHERS WERE QUICK TO READ 
INTO THE METROPOLITAN\'S PRESENCE HOPES OF A SOFTENING IN THE 
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH\'S HITHERTO STRENUOUS OPPOSITION TO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00521  02 OF 03  040621Z 
A PAPAL VISIT TO RUSSIA, REITERATED PUBLICLY ONLY DAYS 
PREVIOUSLY.  INDEED, FIDES, A VATICAN-BASED NEWS-SERVICE, 
CALLED THE HIGH CALIBER OF ORTHODOX SUPPORT FOR THE ASSISI 
MEETING  \"AN UNHOPED FOR STEP CLOSER FOR CHRISTIANS OF EAST 
AND WEST, UNTHINKABLE ONLY MONTHS AGO.\" 
 
ASSESSMENT:  A COUP FOR THE VATICAN. 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
8.  (U) THE ASSISI GATHERING GENERATED ALMOST ENTIRELY 
POSITIVE PRESS FOR THE VATICAN.  IT REINFORCED THE VATICAN\'S 
CAREFULLY CULTIVATED IMAGE AS A MODERN AGENT OF DIALOG 
BETWEEN CULTURES.  IT PROMOTED THE POPE\'S UNIQUE CLAIM TO 
SPEAK AS A UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED MORAL AUTHORITY.  THE 
VATICAN ITSELF ADVANCED ITS AGENDA OF GREATER RAPPROCHEMENT 
WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES, THOUGH A PAPAL TRIP TO RUSSIA 
REMAINS FOR NOW A DISTANT POSSIBILITY. AT ASSISI THE VATICAN 
ALSO TOOK THE OCCASION TO SHOWCASE THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES -- 
E.G. THE SYRO ORTHODOX PATRIARCHATE OF ANTIOCH, THE ARMENIAN 
APOSTOLIC CHURCH, THE ARMENIAN CATHOLICOSATE OF CILICIA, ETC. 
-- WHOSE RELIGIOUS LEADERS WERE A MEDIA SENSATION IN THEIR 
STRIKING CLERICAL GARB. THEIR PRESENCE IN ASSISI WAS A 
SALIENT REMINDER THAT THE OVERARCHING ISSUE FOR THE VATICAN 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND OFTEN ELSEWHERE IS THE PROTECTION OF 
IMPERILED CHRISTIAN MINORITIES.  FINALLY, AND MOST IMPORTANT 
IN THE NEAR TERM, THE ASSISI MEETING PROVIDED AN INTERFAITH 
IMPRIMATUR TO THE VATICAN\'S POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS STRATEGY 
TO ENSURE THAT THE AFTERMATH OF SEPTEMBER 11 DOES NOT EVOLVE 
INTO A WAR BETWEEN RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS. 
 
ALL ABOARD! TICKETS ON THE PEACE TRAIN. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00521  02 OF 03  040621Z 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9.  IN A FITTING SYMBOL, JOHN PAUL II AND OVER 300 RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS DEPARTED TOGETHER FOR ASSISI FROM THE VATICAN RAIL 
STATION, ITS FIRST USE FOR PAPAL TRAVEL SINCE 1979.  DUBBED 
THE PEACE TRAIN, IT WAS A MEDIA METAPHOR FOR THE ASSISI 
MEETING, EMBARKING THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP ON A JOURNEY WITH 
A COMMON PURPOSE. IN MANY RESPECTS, ASSISI WAS A FORUM FOR 
POLITICS BY OTHER MEANS, NOT JUST FOR THE VATICAN BUT FOR 
OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS, TOO, WHO WERE FURNISHED A READY-MADE 
STAGE ON WHICH TO ATTEST THEIR COMMITMENT TO PEACE AND 
DIALOG. 
 
FOSTERING CROSS-CULTURAL DIALOG.

(STRICTLY PROTECT) TOLD POLOFF THAT HE HAS BEEN WAGING AN 
UPHILL BATTLE WITH FACULTY COLLEAGUES ON THE MERITS OF 
OUTREACH TO THE NON-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, 
SEPTEMBER 11, HE SAID, HERALDED A SEA CHANGE. RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS NOW INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT ISLAM HAD A DUTY TO 
ADDRESS THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED IN ITS NAME AND TO COMBAT 
WIDESPREAD IGNORANCE ABOUT NON-MUSLIMS.  HE ADDED THAT SOME 
FORMERLY CRITICAL COLLEAGUES, WHO THEMSELVES ESCHEWED ALL 
CONTACT WITH NON-MUSLIMS, HAD NOW EXPRESSED NEWFOUND 
APPRECIATION FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL OUTREACH.  NONETHELESS, 
THERE WAS GREAT IGNORANCE CONCERNING NON-MUSLIMS, A NEED FOR 
EDUCATION, AND FOR CONTACT WITH NON-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
OF GOOD WILL. HE REGRETTED THAT THE FEW MUSLIM LEADERS WHO 
PRESENT THEMSELVES AS SO-CALLED MODERATES LACK REAL 
THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS AND CREDIBILITY, HARSHLY DENOUNCING 
THE MUFTI OF MARSEILLES IN PARTICULAR.  IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO 
DEVELOP A NEW RELIGIOUS GENERATION WITHIN THE ARAB WORLD, HE 
SAID, EXPLAINING HIS DISCREET COLLABORATION WITH SANT\'EGIDIO 
AND HIS UNOFFICIAL PRESENCE AT THE ASSISI MEETING.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON, REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
 1.  (C) FIDES, A VATICAN NEWS AGENCY, IS SET TO LAUNCH A 
LENTEN APPEAL NEXT WEEK FOR THE FREEDOM OF MISSING OR 
DETAINED UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC CLERGY.  FATHER BERNARDO 
CERVELLERA, FIDES DIRECTOR AND CHINA SPECIALIST, PROVIDED 
AMBASSADOR AN ADVANCE LIST OF MORE THAN 30 NAMES IN ORDER TO 
FOREWARN THE WHITE HOUSE BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO 
CHINA.  THE APPEAL WILL COMPRISE SOME 40 CLERGYMEN IN TOTAL, 
WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL CLERIC LINKED TO A DAY OF LENT.  (LENT 
BEGINS FEBRUARY 13 AND LASTS 40 DAYS.)  THE LIST (SEE PARA 5) 
CONSISTS OF UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC BISHOPS AND PRIESTS WHO ARE 
PERSECUTED BY PRC AUTHORITIES ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR REFUSAL TO 
COLLABORATE WITH THE OFFICIAL \"CATHOLIC PATRIOTIC 
ASSOCIATION.\"  THOUGH NOT SEEKING TO EMBARRASS THE PRESIDENT 
DURING THE CHINA VISIT, FIDES WILL LIKELY CAPITALIZE ON MEDIA 
ATTENTION IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT ISSUES OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
IN CHINA. 
 
2. (C) FATHER CERVELLERA ASSERTED THAT HIS VATICAN SUPERIORS 
HAVE APPROVED THIS LENTEN PRAYER INITIATIVE ON BEHALF OF THE 
UNDERGROUND CHURCH. HE CLAIMED THE PERSONAL ENDORSEMENT OF 
CARDINAL SEPE, THE HEAD OF DE PROPAGANDE FIDE, A.K.A. THE 
CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLES, WHICH ALSO 
OVERSEES THE FIDES NEWS SERVICE.  (NOTE: DE PROPAGANDE FIDE 
IS THE VATICAN MINISTRY CHARGED WITH THE SPREAD OF 
CATHOLICISM AND THE WELFARE OF FRONTIER CHURCH COMMUNITIES, 
SUCH AS IN CHINA.)  CERVELLERA ADDED HE IS ANGLING FOR A 
PAPAL STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR THE FIDES INITIATIVE, PERHAPS 
DURING THE POPE\'S WEEKLY STATEMENT AT THE SUNDAY ANGELUS 
PRAYER.  HOWEVER, NO PAPAL INTERVENTION IS PLANNED AT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00579  01 OF 03  061054Z 
PRESENT, HE ADMITTED. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT:  FATHER CERVELLERA IS SEEKING TO LINK THE 
FIDES INITIATIVE TO THE FORTY DAYS OF LENT. HENCE, THE 
EFFORT, STILL INCOMPLETE, TO MUSTER FORTY NAMES.  HOWEVER, 
THE PRESIDENT\'S VISIT, WHICH FALLS IN THE FIRST WEEK OF LENT, 
IS CLEARLY IN THE FOREGROUND OF CERVELLERA\'S THINKING, EVERY 
BIT AS MUCH AS THE LITURGICAL CALENDAR.  CERVELLERA CONFIDED 
TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE PERSONALLY GIVES GREAT CREDIT TO 
THE INTERVENTION OF PRESIDENT BUSH FOR THE REDUCED SENTENCE 
-- TWO YEARS RATHER THAN THE DEATH PENALTY -- METED OUT TO A 
CHINESE CONVICTED OF ILLICIT TRAFFICKING (IN BIBLES). 
MOREOVER, HE NOTED GRATEFULLY THE HUMAN RIGHTS APPEAL BY 
AMBASSADOR RANDT IN BEIJING ON BEHALF OF BISHOP SU, AS WELL 
AS OTHER NON-CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS LEADERS. CLEARLY, FATHER 
CERVELLERA WOULD WELCOME A USG ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE PLIGHT 
OF UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC CLERGY. 
 
4.  (U) BACKGROUND:  FATHER CERVELLERA IS A COMMITTED VATICAN 
ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE UNDERGROUND CATHOLIC CHURCH. A 
MISSIONARY PRIEST PREVIOUSLY POSTED TO HONG KONG, CERVELLERA 
MAINTAINS EXTENSIVE CONTACTS WITHIN CHINA. UNDER HIS 
DIRECTION, FIDES, A VATICAN INTERNET NEWS ORGANIZATION, HAS 
BEEN PUSHING AN AGENDA OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, PARTICULARLY IN 
REGARD TO CHINA.

1. (C)  POLOFF MET VATICAN UN ISSUES DIRECTOR MONS. DOMINIQUE 
MAMBERTI 02/07 TO DISCUSS REFTEL QUESTIONS ON VATICAN 
POSITION REGARDING UN ANTI-CLONING CONVENTION DEBATE. 
MAMBERTI UNDERSCORED THE HOLY SEE\'S ABSOLUTE OPPOSITION TO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00699  121451Z 
HUMAN CLONING IN ANY FORM, AND REFERRED TO THE POPE\'S 
CONTINUING PUBLIC STATEMENTS OPPOSING IT (MOST RECENTLY 
DURING THE WEDNESDAY, 2/6 GENERAL AUDIENCE).  HE SAID THAT 
THE HOLY SEE TOOK ITS OBSERVER ROLE IN THE AD HOC COMMITTEE 
OF THE SIXTH COMMITTEE VERY SERIOUSLY AND HOPED THAT A 
CONSENSUS WOULD EMERGE IN SUPPORT OF BROADENING THE MANDATE 
GIVEN IT BY UNGA RES. 56/93.  HE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING IN 
56/93 THAT \"EXCLUDES THE POSSIBILITY TO GO BEYOND THE DEBATE 
ON REPRODUCTIVE CLONING.\" 
 
2.  (C)  ASKED WHETHER THE HOLY SEE WAS CONCERNED THAT 
PUSHING TO BROADEN THE MANDATE MIGHT RISK MAKING IT MORE 
DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AN AGREEMENT BANNING REPRODUCTIVE 
CLONING, MAMBERTI REPLIED THAT BROADENING IS A \"TECHNICAL 
CONCERN\" AND DEPENDED ON THE AD HOC COMMITTEE CONSENSUS, 
WHICH HE WOULDN\'T PREDICT.  HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE QUITE OK 
FOR THE HOLY SEE WERE THE UN TO REACH AGREEMENT NOW ON A 
CONVENTION TO BAN REPRODUCTIVE CLONING, AND TO KEEP WORKING 
FOR A BROADER BAN LATER.  (NOTE: WE WERE SURPRISED TO HEAR 
THIS).  CITING THE ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTION, MAMBERTI WAS 
CONCERNED THAT IF THE DEBATE GOT WRAPPED UP OVER BROADENING 
THE MANDATE IT COULD PROLONG ITSELF FOR YEARS, WITH NO 
RESULT. 
 
3.  (U)  MAMBERTI SAID THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S TECHNICAL EXPERT 
ON THE DELEGATION TO THE FIRST MEETING OF THE AD HOC 
COMMITTEE WILL BE DON ROBERTO COLOMBO (NOTE: \"DON\" IS HIS 
ECCLESIASTICAL TITLE). DON ROBERTO, A MILAN BASED PROFESSOR 
OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOETHICS, WAS JUST APPOINTED TO THE 
PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE.  THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE 
CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON BIOETHICS TO INFORM THE CHURCH\'S VIEWS.

BRIEFED ON THAT ASPECT OF THE CLONING DEBATE.  AMBASSADOR 
NICHOLSON WILL DINE WITH MAMBERTI\'S BOSS -- FM TAURAN -- NEXT 
THURSDAY (02/14).  THE PURPOSE OF THAT DINNER WAS TO DISCUSS 
BIOTECHNOLOGY IN AGRICULTURE WITH VISITING EXPERT C.S. 
PRAKASH.  AMBASSADOR WILL RAISE THE ANTI-CLONING CONVENTION, 
WHICH IS RELATED TO THE AG-BIOTECHNOLOGY DEBATE, WITH FM 
TAURAN. MAMBERTI ASSURED US HE WILL BRIEF TAURAN.

SUBJECT: VATICAN ARCHIVES - POPE ORDERS PARTIAL OPENING FOR 
NAZI GERMANY AND WORLD WAR II DOCUMENTS 
 
1.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS ORDERED THE PARTIAL OPENING OF 
THE VATICAN ARCHIVES FOR MATERIAL RELATING TO THE PERIOD 
LEADING TO AND DURING WORLD WAR II. IN A FEBRUARY 15 
STATEMENT THE VATICAN\'S CHIEF ARCHIVIST SAID THAT FROM THE 
BEGINNING OF 2003 MATERIAL FROM PIUS XI\'S PONTIFICATE HELD 
BY THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY PERTAINING TO BAVARIA (1922- 
1939) AND GERMANY (1922-1939), AND IN THE VATICAN SECRET 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00819  190632Z 
ARCHIVE FROM THE APOSTOLIC NUNCIATURE IN MUNICH (1922-1934) 
AND BERLIN (1922-1930) WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO 
RESEARCHERS. THE COMPLETE RELEASE OF ALL DOCUMENTATION 
RELATING TO PIUS XI\'S PONTIFICATE IS STILL SOME THREE YEARS 
AWAY WHEN ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN STATEMENT, MATERIAL ON 
VATICAN-GERMANY ISSUES DURING THE PONTIFICATE OF PIUS XII 
(1939-1958) WILL ALSO BE RELEASED. 
 
2.   ARCHIVAL MATERIAL RELATING TO PRISONERS DURING WORLD 
WAR II WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE FROM 2003. THE VATICAN 
STATEMENT POINTED OUT THAT THE RELEASE OF THIS DOCUMENTATION 
WOULD \"REVEAL TO HISTORIANS THE GREAT WORKS OF CHARITY AND 
ASSISTANCE CARRIED OUT BY PIUS XII ON BEHALF OF THE NUMEROUS 
PRISONERS AND OTHER WAR VICTIMS, FROM WHATEVER NATION, 
RELIGION AND RACE.\" 
 
3.   THE VATICAN STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTED THAT THIS 
EXTRAORDINARY DEPARTURE FROM NORMAL VATICAN ARCHIVE 
PROCEDURES WAS EXPRESSLY ORDERED BY POPE JOHN PAUL II, IN 
THE HOPE THAT THE GESTURE WOULD \"CONTRIBUTE TO THE END OF 
UNJUST AND UNWELCOME SPECULATION.\" 
 
4.   COMMENT: THE DECISION TO PARTIALLY OPEN THE VATICAN 
ARCHIVES RELATING TO VATICAN-GERMAN RELATIONS DURING THE 
LEAD UP TO WORLD WAR II AND DURING THE WAR ITSELF APPEARS TO 
BE AN ATTEMPT BY THE POPE TO SILENCE ACCUSATIONS OF ANTI- 
SEMITISM LEVELED AGAINST HIS PREDECESSOR PIUS XII. IT MAY 
ALSO HERALD RENEWED VATICAN INTEREST IN BEATIFYING PIUS XII 
- FREE FROM THE PALL OF SCANDAL AND DERISION. THE DECISION 
BY POPE JOHN PAUL II TO DISPENSE WITH STANDARD OPERATING 
PROCEDURES IN THIS CASE COMES AFTER YEARS OF VATICAN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00819  190632Z 
PROTESTATIONS THAT THIS MATERIAL COULD NOT BE RELEASED 
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT YET PROPERLY CATALOGUED.  IN ADDITION, 
THE GENERAL ARGUMENT WAS FORWARDED THAT MUCH ARCHIVAL 
MATERIAL WAS \"SENSITIVE\" AND MIGHT EMBARRASS LIVING PERSONS, 
AND THUS SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL AFTER A PROPER PERIOD 
OF TIME - CURRENTLY 70 YEARS.  TODAY\'S DECISION SHOWS THAT 
WHEN THE POPE IS CONCERNED ENOUGH ABOUT CHURCH INTERESTS, HE 
WILL DO AWAY WITH THE VATICAN\'S STANDARD OPERATING 
PROCEDURES IN ORDER TO FURTHER THOSE INTERESTS. THE DECISION 
SHOWS THAT WHATEVER THE POPE WANTS, DOES IN FACT HAPPEN. 
END COMMENT. NICHOLSON

SUBJECT: THE VATICAN\'S \"OTHER\" INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (A) AND (D). 
 
1.(C) SUMMARY:  THIS IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE VATICAN\'S INTEREST 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, OUTSIDE OF THE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN DISPUTE 
AND THE STATUS OF JERUSALEM.  DCM RECENTLY MET WITH NEW 
VATICAN MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR, TOMASSO COPPOLA, MONSIGNOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01171  01 OF 02  061557Z 
JOHAN BONNY, A CHIEF NEGOTIATOR IN THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR 
CHRISTIAN UNITY, AND MEMBERS OF THE ARAB DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY 
ACCREDITED TO THE VATICAN.  THE VATICAN\'S FOREIGN POLICY IS 
GENERALLY FOUNDED ON \"DEFENDING THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN 
PERSON\", AND IS THUS LARGELY CONGRUENT WITH USG INTERESTS. 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, HOWEVER, IT HAS A NUMBER OF PARTICULAR 
INTERESTS, SOME WHERE WE CAN EXPECT TO AGREE, OTHERS WHERE 
OUR INTERESTS ARE STARKLY OPPOSITE.  THE VATICAN\'S INTERESTS 
IN THIS REGION ARISE FROM AN INDIGENOUS CONSTITUENCY (E.G. 
CHALDEANS IN IRAQ) AS WELL AS DIALOG WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH 
OF THE EAST AND THE ORIENTAL ORTHODOX CHURCHES OF THE REGION 
(EG. THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH).  COUNTRIES OF INTEREST ARE 
MOST NOTABLY LEBANON, IRAQ, SYRIA AND TO A LESSER DEGREE 
JORDAN AND EGYPT.  THE LACK OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR THE 
FOREIGN CATHOLICS (MOSTLY FILIPINO GUEST WORKERS) IN SAUDI 
ARABIA WILL REMAIN AN ISSUE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE FOR THE 
VATICAN.  FROM A STRICTLY GEOPOLITICAL PERSPECTIVE THE 
VATICAN WILL ALSO STRIVE TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH IRAN. 
END SUMMARY 
 
2.(C) CONCERN FOR CATHOLIC MINORITIES 
 
AS WITH ANY NATION-STATE, THE VATICAN STRIVES TO PROTECT ITS 
\"CITIZENS\" OVERSEAS.  FOR THE VATICAN, THIS 
CITIZEN-CONSTITUENCY IS COMPOSED OF CATHOLICS.  IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST THE COUNTRY OF PRIME CONCERN IN THIS REGARD IS LEBANON. 
ACCORDING TO VATICAN ISSUED FIGURES, THERE ARE 1.9 MILLION 
CATHOLICS IN LEBANON, 311,000 CATHOLICS IN SYRIA, AND 277,000 
CATHOLICS IN IRAQ.  THE VATICAN DOES NOT CONSIDER LEBANON A 
MUSLIM COUNTRY WITH A CATHOLIC MINORITY, BUT A COUNTRY IN 
WHICH CATHOLICS ARE EQUAL PARTNERS.  IT SEES LEBANON AS A 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01171  01 OF 02  061557Z 
COUNTRY WHICH SHOULD SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR 
CHRISTIAN/ISLAMIC COEXISTENCE.  FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN, AS 
WELL AS MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR COPPOLA HAVE BOTH SERVED IN 
LEBANON, AND ARE PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THE LEBANESE 
SITUATION.  ALTHOUGH, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL VATICAN FIGURES, 
THERE ARE MORE CATHOLICS IN SYRIA THAN IRAQ, THE VATICAN IS 
MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE CHALDEAN CATHOLICS IN 
IRAQ THAN WITH THAT OF THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN SYRIA. 
THIS IS BECAUSE THE VATICAN SEES THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST REGIME COMING TO POWER AS HIGHER IN IRAQ THAN 
IN SYRIA.  THERE IS ALSO A SMALL CATHOLIC MINORITY IN JORDAN 
(72,000 ACCORDING TO VATICAN FIGURES) COMPOSED OF ETHNIC 
PALESTINIANS. 
 
3.(C) DIALOG WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST AND THE 
ORIENTAL ORTHODOX CHURCHES 
 
THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST WAS THE FIRST MAJOR CHRISTIAN 
BODY TO FALL OUT ON COMMUNION WITH ROME.  THIS OCCURRED IN 
THE 5TH CENTURY OVER THEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.  ITS SEAT WAS 
MOVED FROM PERSIA TO BAGHDAD IN 766 WHERE IT HAS REMAINED. 
IN 1553 A GROUP FROM WITHIN THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH REENTERED 
COMMUNION WITH ROME, WHICH WAS THE START OF THE CHALDEAN 
CATHOLIC CHURCH.  THE VATICAN IS CLOSER TO \"REUNIFICATION\" 
WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST THAN WITH ANY OTHER BODY 
OF EASTERN CHURCHES.  IN 1994, POPE JOHN PAUL II AND THE 
ASSYRIAN PATRIARCH SIGNED A DECLARATION WHICH BASICALLY ENDED 
ALL THEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.  DIALOG CONTINUES FOR FULL 
REUNIFICATION.  THUS, IN ADDITION TO PROTECTING THE CATHOLIC 
COMMUNITY OF IRAQ, THE VATICAN NEEDS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01171  01 OF 02  061557Z 
IRAQI GOVERNMENT FOR AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH THE \"OFFICIAL\" IRAQI CHRISTIAN CHURCH CAN CONTINUE. 
 
THE ORIENTAL ORTHODOX COMMUNITY IS COMPOSED OF SIX 
INDEPENDENT NATIONAL CHURCHES WHICH ARE IN COMMUNION WITH 
EACH OTHER, BUT NOT WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST, THE 
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, OR THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES (E.G. GREEK, 
RUSSIAN, ETC).  THIS BODY BROKE WITH THE MAIN BODY OF THE 
CHURCH (AT THAT TIME LOCATED IN ROME AND CONSTANTINOPLE) IN 
THE FIFTH CENTURY, APPROXIMATELY 30 YEARS AFTER THE ASSYRIAN 
CHURCH\'S BREAK.  THIS ORIENTAL ORTHODOX COMMUNITY IS COMPOSED 
OF THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH, THE COPTIC ORTHODOX CHURCH 
(EGYPT), THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX 
CHURCH, THE MALANKARA ORTHODOX SYRIAN CHURCH (INDIA), AND THE 
ERITREAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  THE VATICAN\'S DIALOG WITH THIS 
COMMUNITY IS NOT AS FAR ALONG AS WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH,

SEVERAL JOINT DECLARATIONS WITH THE ARMENIAN CHURCH, COPTIC 
POPE SHENOUDA III OF EGYPT DECLARED THAT DIALOG WITH THE 
VATICAN MUST BE DONE ON A FULL COMMUNITY BASIS, AND NOT BY

4.(C) WHAT ARE THE VATICAN\'S INTERESTS AND WHAT SHOULD THE 
U.S. EXPECT 
 
-- LEBANON:  THE VATICAN WANTS TO MAINTAIN A STRONG CHRISTIAN 
PRESENCE IN A UNIFIED, INDEPENDENT LEBANON.   IT WILL 
CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR THE REMOVAL OF ALL FOREIGN TROOPS (I.E. 
SYRIAN) AND REINTEGRATION OF THE SOUTH INTO THE COUNTRY.  WE 
SHOULD EXPECT THE VATICAN TO CONTINUE TO ASK THE UNITED 
STATES TO HAVE STRONGER, BETTER CONTACTS WITH MARONITE 
PATRIARCH SAFIR.  WE SHOULD ALSO EXPECT THE VATICAN TO 
EXPRESS CONCERN OVER WHAT THEY SEE AS RETALIATION AGAINST THE 
CHRISTIANS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 
COLLABORATING WITH THE ISRAELIS. 
 
IRAQ:  IRAQ WILL REMAIN A BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND VATICAN.  WE SHOULD EXPECT THE VATICAN TO 
STRONGLY CONDEMN THE CONTINUED EMBARGO AS \"HARMFUL\" TO THE 
IRAQI POPULATION.  IN ITS EYES, THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO 
SADDAM HUSSEIN EXCEPT AN ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST REGIME. THUS 
FOR REASONS OF PROTECTING THE CATHOLICS IN IRAQ, AS WELL AS 
CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE 
ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST, THE VATICAN WILL BE AMONG THE 
LEAST VOCAL INTERNATIONAL CRITICS OF THE CURRENT REGIME.  WE 
SHOULD EXPECT VOCAL, PUBLIC CRITICISM OF ANY MILITARY ACTION 
AGAINST IRAQ. 
 
SYRIA:  BECAUSE DAMASCUS IS THE SEAT OF THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX 
CHURCH, AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE CATHOLIC 
COMMUNITY, THE VATICAN IS CONTINUE TO SEEK CORRECT, GOOD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01171  02 OF 02  061557Z 
RELATIONS WITH SYRIA.  AS IT DOES NOT FEAR A FUNDAMENTALIST 
TAKE OVER, IT CAN BE EXPECTED TO BE LESS SENSITIVE TO 
CRITICISM OF SYRIAN POLICY THAN TO IRAQI POLICY.  THAT SAID, 
VATICAN FRUSTRATION OVER THE OVERT ANTI-SEMITIC REMARKS OF 
PRESIDENT ASSAD DURING THE POPE\'S APRIL, 2001 VISIT TO SYRIA 
HAVE SUBSIDED.  IN FACT, THE POPE RECENTLY SUSPENDED HIS 
LENTEN RETREAT (WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL) TO MEET ASSAD DURING 
THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT\'S VISIT TO ROME; 
 
IRAN:  THE NUMBER OF CATHOLICS IS MINUSCULE (12,000 BY 
VATICAN ESTIMATES).  HOWEVER, THE VATICAN SEES IRAN AS A 
PARTNER IN CATHOLIC/ISLAMIC DIALOG.  IT WILL THEREFORE STRIVE 
TO HAVE PROPER RELATIONS WITH THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN; 
 
SAUDI ARABIA: THERE ARE OVER 1 MILLION FOREIGN CATHOLICS IN 
SAUDI ARABIA.  THE VATICAN WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THEIR RIGHT 
TO PRACTICE CATHOLICISM AN INTERNATIONAL ISSUE.  WE SHOULD 
EXPECT THIS TO BE RAISED AT ANY MEETING BETWEEN A HIGH-LEVEL 
U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN OR PRIME 
MINISTER SODANO.  NICHOLSON

SUBJECT: THE VATICAN\'S \"OTHER\" INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (A) AND (D). 
 
1.(C) SUMMARY:  THIS IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE VATICAN\'S INTEREST 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, OUTSIDE OF THE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN DISPUTE 
AND THE STATUS OF JERUSALEM.  DCM RECENTLY MET WITH NEW 
VATICAN MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR, TOMASSO COPPOLA, MONSIGNOR 
JOHAN BONNY, A CHIEF NEGOTIATOR IN THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR 
CHRISTIAN UNITY, AND MEMBERS OF THE ARAB DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01171  01 OF 02  061421Z 
ACCREDITED TO THE VATICAN.  THE VATICAN\'S FOREIGN POLICY IS 
GENERALLY FOUNDED ON \"DEFENDING THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN 
PERSON\", AND IS THUS LARGELY CONGRUENT WITH USG INTERESTS. 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, HOWEVER, IT HAS A NUMBER OF PARTICULAR 
INTERESTS, SOME WHERE WE CAN EXPECT TO AGREE, OTHERS WHERE 
OUR INTERESTS ARE STARKLY OPPOSITE.  THE VATICAN\'S INTERESTS 
IN THIS REGION ARISE FROM AN INDIGENOUS CONSTITUENCY (E.G. 
CHALDEANS IN IRAQ) AS WELL AS DIALOG WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH 
OF THE EAST AND THE ORIENTAL ORTHODOX CHURCHES OF THE REGION 
(EG. THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH).  COUNTRIES OF INTEREST ARE 
MOST NOTABLY LEBANON, IRAQ, SYRIA AND TO A LESSER DEGREE 
JORDAN AND EGYPT.  THE LACK OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR THE 
FOREIGN CATHOLICS (MOSTLY FILIPINO GUEST WORKERS) IN SAUDI 
ARABIA WILL REMAIN AN ISSUE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE FOR THE 
VATICAN.  FROM A STRICTLY GEOPOLITICAL PERSPECTIVE THE 
VATICAN WILL ALSO STRIVE TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH IRAN. 
END SUMMARY 
 
2.(C) CONCERN FOR CATHOLIC MINORITIES 
 
AS WITH ANY NATION-STATE, THE VATICAN STRIVES TO PROTECT ITS 
\"CITIZENS\" OVERSEAS.  FOR THE VATICAN, THIS 
CITIZEN-CONSTITUENCY IS COMPOSED OF CATHOLICS.  IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST THE COUNTRY OF PRIME CONCERN IN THIS REGARD IS LEBANON. 
ACCORDING TO VATICAN ISSUED FIGURES, THERE ARE 1.9 MILLION 
CATHOLICS IN LEBANON, 311,000 CATHOLICS IN SYRIA, AND 277,000 
CATHOLICS IN IRAQ.  THE VATICAN DOES NOT CONSIDER LEBANON A 
MUSLIM COUNTRY WITH A CATHOLIC MINORITY, BUT A COUNTRY IN 
WHICH CATHOLICS ARE EQUAL PARTNERS.  IT SEES LEBANON AS A 
COUNTRY WHICH SHOULD SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR 
CHRISTIAN/ISLAMIC COEXISTENCE.  FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN, AS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01171  01 OF 02  061421Z 
WELL AS MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR COPPOLA HAVE BOTH SERVED IN 
LEBANON, AND ARE PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THE LEBANESE 
SITUATION.  ALTHOUGH, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL VATICAN FIGURES, 
THERE ARE MORE CATHOLICS IN SYRIA THAN IRAQ, THE VATICAN IS 
MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE CHALDEAN CATHOLICS IN 
IRAQ THAN WITH THAT OF THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN SYRIA. 
THIS IS BECAUSE THE VATICAN SEES THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST REGIME COMING TO POWER AS HIGHER IN IRAQ THAN 
IN SYRIA.  THERE IS ALSO A SMALL CATHOLIC MINORITY IN JORDAN 
(72,000 ACCORDING TO VATICAN FIGURES) COMPOSED OF ETHNIC 
PALESTINIANS. 
 
3.(C) DIALOG WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST AND THE 
ORIENTAL ORTHODOX CHURCHES 
 
THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST WAS THE FIRST MAJOR CHRISTIAN 
BODY TO FALL OUT ON COMMUNION WITH ROME.  THIS OCCURRED IN 
THE 5TH CENTURY OVER THEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.  ITS SEAT WAS 
MOVED FROM PERSIA TO BAGHDAD IN 766 WHERE IT HAS REMAINED. 
IN 1553 A GROUP FROM WITHIN THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH REENTERED 
COMMUNION WITH ROME, WHICH WAS THE START OF THE CHALDEAN 
CATHOLIC CHURCH.  THE VATICAN IS CLOSER TO \"REUNIFICATION\" 
WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST THAN WITH ANY OTHER BODY 
OF EASTERN CHURCHES.  IN 1994, POPE JOHN PAUL II AND THE 
ASSYRIAN PATRIARCH SIGNED A DECLARATION WHICH BASICALLY ENDED 
ALL THEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.  DIALOG CONTINUES FOR FULL 
REUNIFICATION.  THUS, IN ADDITION TO PROTECTING THE CATHOLIC 
COMMUNITY OF IRAQ, THE VATICAN NEEDS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE 
IRAQI GOVERNMENT FOR AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH THE \"OFFICIAL\" IRAQI CHRISTIAN CHURCH CAN CONTINUE. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01171  01 OF 02  061421Z 
 
THE ORIENTAL ORTHODOX COMMUNITY IS COMPOSED OF SIX 
INDEPENDENT NATIONAL CHURCHES WHICH ARE IN COMMUNION WITH 
EACH OTHER, BUT NOT WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST, THE 
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, OR THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES (E.G. GREEK, 
RUSSIAN, ETC).  THIS BODY BROKE WITH THE MAIN BODY OF THE 
CHURCH (AT THAT TIME LOCATED IN ROME AND CONSTANTINOPLE) IN 
THE FIFTH CENTURY, APPROXIMATELY 30 YEARS AFTER THE ASSYRIAN 
CHURCH\'S BREAK.  THIS ORIENTAL ORTHODOX COMMUNITY IS COMPOSED 
OF THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH, THE COPTIC ORTHODOX CHURCH 
(EGYPT), THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX 
CHURCH, THE MALANKARA ORTHODOX SYRIAN CHURCH (INDIA), AND THE 
ERITREAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  THE VATICAN\'S DIALOG WITH THIS 
COMMUNITY IS NOT AS FAR ALONG AS WITH THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH,

1. (C)  PER REFTELCON, POLOFF MET MORNING OF MONDAY, APRIL 15 
WITH VATICAN DESK OFFICER FOR MADAGASCAR AFFAIRS MONS. LUIGI 
CAVALIERE.  (NOTE: CAVALIERE, AN \"OLD SCHOOL\" VATICAN 
DIPLOMAT WHO ALSO COVERS AUSTRIA, FRANCE, NETHERLANDS, 
SWITZERLAND AND SEVERAL OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES, HAD -- LIKE 
POLOFF -- TO READ UP ON THE SITUATION IN MADAGASCAR BEFORE 
THE MEETING. END NOTE.)  CAVALIERE HAD NOTHING MUCH TO OFFER 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01921  180557Z 
BY WAY OF INSIGHT ON A WAY OUT OF THE DETERIORATING SITUATION 
IN MADAGASCAR.  CAVALIERE SAID THE SITUATION WAS DELICATE, 
BUT VAGUE AND FLUID, AND HADN\'T MUCH MORE TO ADD.  IN FACT, 
TO UNDERSCORE THE HOLY SEE\'S LACK OF FOCUS ON MADAGASCAR, HE 
CHARACTERIZED IT AS A \"CIOCCOLATINO\" (CHOCOLATE TIDBIT) 
COMPARED TO THE HOLY SEE\'S WORRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
INDEED, HE LIMITED HIMSELF TO RESTATING THE POPE\'S LAST 
PRONOUNCEMENT ON MADAGASCAR, READ AT THE MARCH 3 ANGELUS 
PRAYER, IN WHICH THE PONTIFF CALLED FOR PEACE, JUSTICE AND 
DIALOGUE. 
 
2.  (C)  NOTING THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD IN OTHER AFRICAN 
CONFLICT AREAS BEEN ABLE TO EMPLOY A SPECIAL DIALOGUE WITH 
INVOLVED PARTIES (E.G. THE JESUIT CONTACTS WITH MUGABE), 
POLOFF ASKED WHETHER THE CAVALIERE KNEW OF ANY PERSONAL 
CONTACTS CHURCH OFFICIALS MIGHT HAVE WITH RATSIRANGA.  HE 
KNEW OF NONE, BUT AVERRED THAT THE NUNCIO (WHO HAD JUST 
RETURNED TO ANTANANARIVO FROM A FAMILY VISIT IN ITALY) WOULD 
BE IN THE BEST POSITION TO TALK TO BOTH PARTIES. 
 
3. (C)  COMMENT:  OBVIOUSLY CAVALIERE WAS NOT SO CONCERNED AT 
DEVELOPMENTS IN MADAGASCAR ACTUALLY TO BE FOLLOWING THEM.  HE 
TOLD US HE HAD RELIED MOSTLY ON FRENCH DAILY LE MONDE 
REPORTS.  INDEED, HE SEEMED TO BE LIVING UP TO HIS NAME -- 
FOR EXAMPLE HE POOH-POOHED THE USG DECISION TO MOVE TO 
ORDERED DEPARTURE.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE HIS CAVALIER ATTITUDE 
WOULD REFLECT THE CONCERNS OF HIS SUPERIORS.

1. (C)  PER REFTEL, AMBASSADOR MET WITH VATICAN FM EQUIVALENT 
ARCHBISHOP JEAN LOUIS TAURAN EVENING OF APRIL 19 TO URGE THE 
HOLY SEE TO TAKE AN ACTIVE AND APPROPRIATE ROLE IN SUPPORT OF 
VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY.  TAURAN WAS WELL BRIEFED ON THE 
SITUATION IN VENEZUELA.  AS USUAL, HE REFERRED TO THE POPE\'S 
STATEMENT ON THE SITUATION (PROMOTING RECONCILIATION AND 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01975  221619Z 
PEACE), GIVEN AT THE WEDNESDAY, APRIL 17 GENERAL AUDIENCE. 
HE WAS GUARDEDLY POSITIVE ON THE CHURCH TALKING A PLACE IN 
PRESIDENT CHAVEZ\' \"NATIONAL DIALOGUE,\" BUT SAID THAT THE 
POSITION OF THE CHURCH VIS A VIS CHAVEZ WAS UNCERTAIN, GIVEN 
THE LATTER\'S HISTORICAL HOSTILITY TO THE CHURCH.  AMBASSADOR 
AGREED, RECALLING THAT CHAVEZ HAD CALLED THE CHURCH \"A 
CANCER\" ON THE VENEZUELAN BODY POLITIC JUST A COUPLE OF 
MONTHS AGO. 
 
2. (C)  TAURAN SAID THE CHURCH HAD TO BE CAREFUL, THAT EVEN 
THOUGH TIME WAS SHORT, THEY WOULD TAKE A LOW PROFILE UNTIL 
THE EARLY POST-COUP PERIOD PLAYS OUT.  HE SAID CHAVEZ IS 
TALKING RECONCILIATION NOW BUT, TAURAN AVERRED, CHAVEZ WAS 
NOT AT ALL TRUSTWORTHY.  THE HOLY SEE FEARS A NEGATIVE 
REACTION TO THE FACT THAT THE CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP OF CARACAS, 
VELASCO GARCIA, HAD SIGNED A DOCUMENT AT THE SATURDAY 
INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENTIAL USURPER CARMONA. 
 
3. (C)  TAURAN COUNSELED THE USG TO \"PRESSURE\" THE MILITARY 
AND BUSINESS CLASSES IN VENEZUELA TO SUPPORT THE NATIONAL 
RECONCILIATION NOW THAT CHAVEZ WAS BACK IN POWER.  HE 
SPECULATED THAT SOME GENERALS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE COUP, 
HAVING SEEN THAT A CARMONA PRESIDENCY LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD 
INVESTIGATE CORRUPTION SCANDALS IN VENEZUELA, DECIDED THAT 
PERHAPS CHAVEZ WAS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS. TAURAN DECRIED 
THE CONTINUING PRESENCE OF \"THOSE 15 CUBAN ADVISORS\" AND 
RECALLED THAT WHEN THE POPE MET FIDEL CASTRO IN 1998, FIDEL 
HAD SAID THERE WAS A YOUNG NEW LEADER ON THE SCENE, CALLING 
CHAVEZ \"SPLENDID.\"  TAURAN CLOSED BY ASSURING US THAT HE 
WOULD SPEAK TO HIS NUNCIO OVER THE WEEKEND, AND WOULD STAY IN 
CLOSE TOUCH AS WE GO FORWARD.

OUT WHETHER THE VATICAN HAD CONTACTED LATIN AMERICAN 
COUNTRIES MENTIONED IN REF A INSTRUCTION.  MAMBERTI HAD MET

SEE.  IN ADDITION, PAPAL NUNCIOS HAD TRACKED THE DEMARCHE 
WITH CERTAIN OTHERS. 
 
2.  (C)  MAMBERTI SAID THAT THE VATICAN HAD NOT APPROACHED 
ALL OF THE COUNTRIES ON THE LIST, BUT RATHER HAD CONCENTRATED 
ON THOSE THAT ARCHBISHOP MARTINO, VATICAN PERMREP AT THE UN, 
BELIEVED WOULD BE MOST AMENABLE TO PRESSURE.  THOSE COUNTRIES 
INCLUDED NICARAGUA, HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, COSTA RICA AND 
URUGUAY.  HE WAS NOT ABLE TO SAY IN WHICH CAPITALS NUNCIOS 
HAD TRACKED THE MESSAGE.  MAMBERTI SAID THE VATICAN 
UNDERSTOOD THAT ALMOST ALL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAD VERY 
STRONG ANTI-ABORTION LEGISLATION ON THE BOOKS, BUT THAT 
PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE WAS ANOTHER MATTER.  HE HINTED THAT 
THE VATICAN\'S DEMARCHES FOCUSED ON THIS STRONG LEGISLATION 
AND THE NEED TO AVOID COMMITTING STATES TO UN LANGUAGE THAT 
HAD THE FUTURE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE NATIONAL LEGISLATION. 
POST WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS ISSUE WITH OUR 
INTERLOCUTORS AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE UNGASS.

AMBASSADOR BINDENAGEL MET WITH VATICAN OFFICIALS APRIL 26 FOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  02229  01 OF 02  081737Z 
A LAST UPDATE ON THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO PONTIFICAL ARCHIVES 
FOR RESEARCH RELATED TO THE SHOAH AND THE PONTIFICATE OF PIUS 
XII. HE MET SEPARATELY WITH VATICAN DFM MSGR. MIGLIORE AND 
CARDINAL KASPAR, HEAD OF THE VATICAN\'S COMMISSION FOR 
RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM.  BOTH NOTED GRADUAL 
HEADWAY, YET ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE SETBACK OF THE 2001 
BREAKDOWN OF THE JEWISH-VATICAN COMMISSION TO STUDY PIUS 
XII\'S WWII ROLE. KASPAR NARRATED HIS EFFORTS TO FOUND A NEW 
COMMISSION BASED ON COLLABORATION BETWEEN ACADEMIC 
INSTITUTIONS THAT WOULD MARGINALIZE INVOLVEMENT BY THE 
VATICAN AND THE WORLD JEWISH CONGRESS. KASPAR AND MIGLIORE 
DENOUNCED A RESURGENT ANTI-SEMITISM, NURTURED IN THEIR 
OPINION BY THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS, AND ALSO VOICED CONCERN AT 
THE APRIL 21 FRENCH ELECTION RESULTS. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) AMBASSADOR J.D. BINDENAGEL, SPECIAL ENVOY FOR 
HOLOCAUST ISSUES, MET SEPARATELY APRIL 26 AT THE VATICAN WITH 
DFM CELESTINO MIGLIORE AND CARDINAL WALTAR KASPAR, HEAD OF 
THE COMMISION FOR RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM. POLOFF 
ATTENDED BOTH MEETINGS AS NOTETAKER; MSGR. FUMAGELLI 
ACCOMPANIED CARDINAL KASPAR. 
 
3. (C) CARDINAL KASPAR NOTED THAT THE ACTS OF THE BERLIN 
NUNCIATURE UP TO 1939, COVERING THE REIGN OF PIUS XI, WOULD 
BE ACCESSIBLE IN 2003. ALTHOUGH THESE WOULD NOT INCLUDE 
DOCUMENTS FROM THE PAPACY OF PIUS XII, THEY HAVE SPECIAL 
RELEVANCE GIVEN THE ROLE OF EUGENIO PACELLI, THE FUTURE PIUS 
XII, AS NUNCIO IN BERLIN AND LATER SECRETARY OF STATE UNDER 
PIUS XI.  YET KASPAR STATED HE WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE THE 
TIMETABLE FOR OPENING THE VATICAN ARCHIVES FOR THE REIGN OF 
PIUS XII, CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED ABOUT 2010 (REF).  NOT ONLY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  02229  01 OF 02  081737Z 
WERE THOSE ARCHIVES IN EXTREME DISORDER -- A \"DURCHEINANDER\" 
HE DECLARED IN GERMAN -- AND IN NEED OF PAINSTAKING REVIEW, 
BUT THESE ARCHIVES WERE THE DOMAIN OF THE VATICAN SECRETARIAT 
AND NOT THE COUNCIL FOR RELATIONS WITH THE JEWS.  HE REMARKED 
THE SECRETARIAT HOLDS NO FEAR OF THE HISTORICAL VERDICT, 
HOWEVER WORK MUST PROCEED METHODICALLY. KASPAR COMMENTED THAT 
SINCE HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION ENTAILED MAKING JUDGMENTS AND 
NOT SIMPLY ASCERTAINING FACTS, THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE SOME 
DISAGREEMENT.  EARLIER MIGLIORE, TOO, HAD SPOKEN SIMILARLY, 
OPINING THAT IDEOLOGICAL CONCERNS WERE GUIDING MANY 
RESEARCHERS.  MIGLIORE DECRIED THE RECENT COSTA-GRAVAS FILM 
\"AMEN\" FOR ITS LACK OF CONCERN FOR HISTORICAL TRUTH. 
 
4. (C)  KASPAR LAMENTED THE 2001 BREAKDOWN OF THE 
JEWISH-VATICAN COMMISSION ESTABLISHED IN 1999 TO ASSESS THE 
12 VOLUME SET OF HOLY SEE ARCHIVAL MATERIALS RELATING TO THE 
WWII PAPACY OF PIUS XII AND THE HOLOCAUST. THAT COMMISSION 
LOOKED GOOD ON PAPER, HE STATED, YET ITS EXECUTION WAS DEEPLY 
FLAWED, CITING THE LACK OF SHARED CRITERIA, THE WANT OF 
MUTUAL TRUST, AND THE UNHELPFUL RECOURSE BY INDIVIDUAL 
PARTICIPANTS TO THE MEDIA.  HE ALSO FAULTED THE COMMISSION 
FOR ITS FAILURE TO INCLUDE A EUROPEAN HISTORIAN, GIVEN THAT 
THE HOLOCAUST WAS FUNDAMENTALLY A EUROPEAN AFFAIR. KASPAR 
DISAVOWED ANY BLAME FOR THE BREAKDOWN, BUT EMPHASIZED THE 
COMMISSION WAS FRAGILE FROM THE START.  KASPAR HAS SINCE 
SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A NEW COMMISSION THAT WOULD PROCEED ON AN 
ACADEMIC PLANE, AS A COOPERATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN TEL AVIV AND 
FRANKFURT UNIVERSITIES, IN PLACE OF THE PREVIOUS 
VATICAN-WORLD JEWISH CONGRESS DRIVEN COMMISSION.  HIS PROJECT 
FOUNDERED, ACCORDING TO KASPAR, WHEN TEL AVIV SOUGHT NEW 
CONDITIONS BEYOND KASPAR\'S AUTHORIZATION, MOST NOTABLY THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02229  01 OF 02  081737Z 
INCLUSION OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, ALLEGEDLY DUE TO PRESSURE 
BY TEL AVIV\'S U.S. FINANCIAL BACKERS. 
 
5. (C) BOTH KASPAR AND MIGLIORE DECRIED THE APRIL 21 
ELECTORAL SUCCESS OF FRENCH NATIONAL LEADER JEAN-MARIE LE 
PEN, A REPUTED ANTI-SEMITE. KASPAR, IN PARTICULAR, REPEATEDLY 
DECLARED HIS REVULSION, AND DELIVERED AN IMPASSIONED 
DENUNCIATION OF ANTI-SEMITISM, IN WHICH HE REITERATED THE 
CENTRALITY OF JUDAISM TO CHRISTIANITY  -- \"OUR ELDER BROTHER 
IN THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM\" IN THE WORDS OF JOHN PAUL II -- AND 
OF JUDAISM TO EUROPEAN CULTURE. \"WITHOUT JUDAISM YOU CANNOT 
EVEN SPEAK OF CULTURE IN BERLIN AND VIENNA,\" KASPAR REMARKED, 
ADDED THAT IN HIS YOUTH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN ABSORBED BY THE 
THOUGHT OF JEWISH PHILOSOPHER MARTIN BUBER. 
 
6. (C)  MIGLIORE LINKED RESURGENT EUROPEAN ANTI-SEMITISM TO 
FALLOUT FROM DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, A VIEW KASPAR 
SHARED IN PRINCIPLE, ALTHOUGH THE CARDINAL TOOK EXPLICIT CARE 
TO CONDEMN PALESTINIAN HOMICIDAL BOMBERS AS WELL AS ISRAELI 
ACTIONS IN BETHLEHEM. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT: DFM MIGLIORE\'S REMARKS REVEAL THAT THE 
VATICAN MFA NOW VIEWS THE ARCHIVAL DISPUTE AS A QUESTION OF 
SECONDARY IMPORTANCE, A NUISANCE THAT PALES IN RELATION TO

KASPAR, ON THE OTHER HAND, SEEMED MORE AT EASE WITH THE 
SUBJECT, WHICH HE VIEWS IN THE CONTEXT OF A COMMITMENT TO 
JEWISH-CHRISTIAN RECONCILIATION.  KASPAR BELIEVES THE VATICAN 
HAS TAKEN IMPORTANT AND IRREVERSIBLE STEPS FORWARD TO DEFUSE 
THE ARCHIVAL DISPUTE, YET HE IS EVIDENTLY DISAPPOINTED AT THE

PERCEIVED LACK OF RECIPROCAL GESTURES; HE APPEALED

FURTHER.  KASPAR, WHO BRIEFLY TAUGHT IN THE U.S. AS A GUEST 
PROFESSOR, WAS PLEASED TO LEARN MORE OF USG INITIATIVES, 
PARTICULARLY ON HOLOCAUST COMPENSATION; THE CHANCE TO 
CONVERSE IN HIS NATIVE GERMAN ALSO APPEARED TO ELICIT A MORE

 1. (C)  SUMMARY: VATICAN MFA RUSSIA DIRECTOR TRICARICO IS 
UNHAPPY AND AGITATED ABOUT THE GOR REFUSAL OF VISAS TO 
CATHOLIC CLERGY, ESPECIALLY TO BISHOP MAZUR.  HE BELIEVES THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE GOR MUST HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE NEW 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  02239  01 OF 02  081446Z 
POLICY TO REJECT CATHOLIC CLERGY VISAS.  HE SAID THE POPE AND 
HIS CHURCH WANT RECONCILIATION WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX, BUT 
THAT AFTER 80 YEARS OF PERSECUTION AND A FURTHER DECADE OF 
ONE-SIDED ATTEMPTS AT RAPPROCHEMENT, THEY HAVE YET TO SEE 
PROGRESS.  NEVERTHELESS, THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE ITS 
MINISTRY IN RUSSIA, AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE A RAPPROCHEMENT 
WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX. 
 
--------------------------- 
AGITATED OVER VISA REFUSALS 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) POLOFF MET 05/02 WITH VATICAN MFA RUSSIA/NIS DIRECTOR 
ARCHBISHOP ALBERTO TRICARICO TO DISCUSS VATICAN/RUSSIAN 
RELATIONS IN WAKE OF EXPULSION OF TWO CLERGY MEMBERS IN 
RECENT DAYS.  TRICARICO, ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR OF VATICAN 
MFA \"COUNTRY DIRECTORS,\" WAS AGITATED, SAYING THE HOLY SEE 
HAD BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO ACCOMMODATE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX 
PATRIARCH ALEXIY, BUT THERE HAD BEEN NO POSITIVE RESPONSE. 
HE SAID THE GOR AVERRED CANCELLATION OF VISAS FOR THE TWO 
CLERGY WAS AN ACT OF \"SOVEREIGNTY,\" BUT THE VATICAN WAS STILL 
WAITING FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE LEGAL BASIS FOR IT.  HE WAS 
PARTICULARLY UPSET THAT THE GOR HAD DENIED BISHOP MAZUR THE 
RIGHT TO RETURN TO HIS FLOCK.  TRICARICO UNDERSCORED THAT THE 
REFUSAL OF A VISA TO A BISHOP WAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY BY THE 
VATICAN -- IN THIS CASE IT WAS A \"HISTORICAL ACT\" WHICH 
DEFIED THE HOLY SEE\'S 1989 AGREEMENT WITH THE SOVIET UNION ON 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  HE BELIEVED THAT THE GOR WOULDN\'T REFUSE 
A VISA TO A BISHOP WITHOUT HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT 
KNOWING. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  02239  01 OF 02  081446Z 
3.  (C)  TRICARICO SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD PROTESTED THE 
EXPULSION OF ITS CLERGY AT THE OSCE.  WE ASKED HIM ABOUT THE 
RUSSIAN OSCE AMBASSADOR\'S COMMENT THAT MAZUR\'S VISA REFUSAL 
WAS LINKED TO THE USE OF THE OLD JAPANESE NAME FOR SAKHALIN 
DIOCESE\'S SOUTHERN DISTRICT (REF B).   TRICARICO SAID THAT 
WAS SPECIOUS.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE CHURCH HAD CALLED THAT 
DISTRICT KARAFUTO SINCE 1938, AND THAT IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE 
DECISION BY THE POPE TO MAKE THE FOUR DIOCESES OFFICIAL THAT 
THEY HAD HEARD ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT IT. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
TRICARICO ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C)  TO PUT THE CHURCH\'S SITUATION IN RUSSIA INTO 
PERSPECTIVE, TRICARICO SAID IT NEEDS 100\'S OF BISHOPS, BUT 
ONLY HAS FOUR.  HE AGREED WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPAL THAT 
CLERGY SHOULD BE NATIONALS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY 
MINISTER, AND NOTED THAT THERE ARE NOW 74 SEMINARIANS IN THE 
ST. PETERSBURG SEMINARY.  OVER TIME, HE FORECAST, FOREIGN 
CLERGY WON\'T BE NEEDED.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
WAS DOING LOTS OF SOCIAL WORK IN RUSSIA, WITH HOSPITALS, 
SCHOOLS AND SOCIAL CENTERS FOR PENSIONERS.  GIVEN THIS, MANY 
IN THE VATICAN FEEL PARTICULARLY BETRAYED BY THE GOR\'S 
ACTIONS AFTER THE CREATION OF THE FOUR RUSSIAN DIOCESES. 
TRICARICO REPEATEDLY ASSERTED THAT CATHOLICS HAD BEEN 
PERSECUTED IN RUSSIA FOR 80 YEARS, THROWN INTO THE GULAG, AND 
MANY MARTYRED, AND \"THIS IS OUR REWARD?\" 
 
5. (C)  TRICARICO SAID THAT THE POPE SINCERELY WISHED FOR A 
RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX; HE WOULD GIVE UP 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02239  01 OF 02  081446Z 
ANYTHING \"SAVE THE FREEDOM\" OF HIS CATHOLIC FLOCK TO PRACTICE 
THEIR  FAITH.  BUT DESPITE ALL THE APOLOGIES FOR HISTORICAL 
TRANSGRESSIONS, THE OUTREACH TO ORTHODOX CHURCHES IN OTHER 
COUNTRIES, THE DISCRETION THAT CATHOLICS PRACTICED IN RUSSIA 
(I.E. MAKING RUSSIANS WHO WISH TO CONVERT TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS 
OF REFLECTION BEFORE ACCEPTING THEM TO THE CHURCH), PATRIARCH 
ALEXIY AND THE ORTHODOX OFFER NAUGHT BUT A STONEWALL. 
TRICARICO AVERRED THAT THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CLERGY SUFFERED 
FROM \"SOCIALIST WAYS OF THINKING; THEY WERE ALL COLLABORATORS 
IN PAST AND CAN\'T SHAKE OLD WAYS\" (PLEASE STRICTLY PROTECT). 
 
---------- 
WHAT NEXT? 
---------- 
 
6. (C) FOR NOW, BISHOP MAZUR IS COOLING HIS HEELS AT HIS OLD 
PARISH IN WARSAW.  THE POPE IS HOPEFUL THAT ANY MOMENT THINGS 
WILL BREAK, AND MAZUR WILL BE PERMITTED TO RETURN.  TRICARICO 
DID NOT MENTION WHETHER CAPRIO MIGHT RETURN TO MOSCOW.  WE

75 LATER THIS YEAR AND SUBMIT HIS RESIGNATION) HIS VIEWS ON 
THE ORTHODOX CLERGY\'S \"COLLABORATIONIST\" PROCLIVITIES ARE 
SHARPENED.  PRIOR TO TAKING MFA RESPONSIBILITIES FOR RUSSIA 
AND THE NIS COUNTRIES, TRICARICO HAD BEEN NUNCIO IN S/E ASIA 
FOR MYANMAR AND LAOS, AND HAD SERVED IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN 
NUNCIATURES.  WHILE TIRCARICO SOUNDED TO US SOMEWHAT 
CONFRONTATIONAL ON THE RUSSIAN ISSUES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE 
VATICAN ITSELF WILL, TRUE TO FORM, TAKE A LONG VIEW OF THE 
PROBLEM AND WORK PATIENTLY AND DISCRETELY TO ADVANCE ITS 
INTERESTS. EMBASSY CONVERSATIONS WITH RUSSIAN EMBASSY AND 
ORTHODOX CHURCH REPRESENTATIVES IN ROME WILL BE REPORTED

AGRICULTURE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD COULD INFLUENCE DECISION 
MAKERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND WOULD UNDERCUT ANTI-GMO 
EUROPEAN ACTIVISTS\' ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO 
GMO-HOSTILE EU AND EU-MEMBER STATES\' POLICIES. VATICAN 
DECISION MAKERS BELIEVE BIOTECHNOLOGY IS PROMISING, BUT THEY 
COUNSEL CAUTION AND PATIENCE BECAUSE OF UNKNOWN RISKS.  KEY 
TO MOVING THE VATICAN POSITION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GMOS IS 
UNDERSTANDING ITS PEOPLE AND ITS FOREIGN POLICY LEITMOTIF: 
\"THE TRUE GOOD OF THE HUMAN PERSON.\"  BEFORE VATICAN DECISION 
MAKERS WILL PROMOTE BIOTECH, THEY WILL WANT TO SEE 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, AND SOCIAL AND CONSUMER CONCERNS 
ADDRESSED.   THE VATICAN NEEDS CONVINCING THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY 
AND GMOS ARE FOR TODAY, AND THAT THE BEST SCIENCE DOVETAILS 
WITH ITS LEITMOTIF. 
 
2.  (SBU)  WORKING WITH EMBASSY ROME BIOTECH ACTION GROUP, 
EMBASSY VATICAN IS MAKING THIS ISSUE A FOCUSED PRIORITY OF 
OUR ACTIVITIES DURING THE COMING MONTHS. BUILDING ON OUR 
PREVIOUS EFFORTS (E.G. AMBASSADOR HOSTED DINNER FOR GMO 
EXPERT C.C. PRAKASH), WE WILL FOCUS ON BRINGING IN U.S. 
EXPERTS FOR CONSULTATIONS, NOMINATING A VATICAN FOREIGN 
MINISTRY OFFICIAL FOR THE INTERNATIONAL VISITORS PROGRAM, 
PROPOSING ACTIVITIES ON THE MARGINS OF THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT 
IN JUNE, AND HOSTING A VISIT TO INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL 
RESEARCH STATIONS FOR VATICAN EXPERTS LATER IN 2002.  WE HAVE 
A GOOD WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO PRESS THE VATICAN ON THIS 
WITH THE NEW CONVERGENCE BETWEEN IT AND THE USG ON THE FLIP 
SIDE OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTECH -- HUMAN CLONING.  END SUMMARY.

3.  (U) ARTICLES IN \"LA CIVILITA CATTOLICA,\" A SEMI-OFFICIAL 
VATICAN PUBLICATION, ARE VETTED BY THE VATICAN\'S SECRETARIAT 
OF STATE BEFORE PUBLISHING. THEY TEND TO REFLECT CURRENT 
VATICAN POLICY AND PREOCCUPATIONS. JESUIT PRIEST AND FORMER 
PROFESSOR OF HUMAN GENETICS IN THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE AT 
GEMELLI CLINIC, ANGELO SERRA, RECENTLY WROTE AN ASSESSMENT OF 
PLANT AND ANIMAL BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR \"LA CIVILTA CATTOLICA.\" 
SERRA\'S ARTICLE OFFERS INSIGHTS ON VATICAN THINKING ON 
SEVERAL ASPECTS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATION, AND 
FORMULATES \"NEW OBLIGATIONS\" FOR SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND 
SOCIETY. 
 
4.  (U) THE ARTICLE LAUDS COLLABORATION BETWEEN SCIENTISTS, 
REGULATORS, FARMERS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS (PARTICULARLY IN 
THE U.S.) AS A SOURCE OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN GMO\'S, SERRA 
DEDICATES THE GREATER PART OF HIS ARTICLE TO THE \"RISKS\" OF 
BIOTECHNOLOGY. FIRSTLY, FOOD AND HEALTH SECURITY RISKS: THE 
INCREASE IN ALLERGIES, RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS AND OF MOST 
CONCERN, ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE. THE U.S. IS SINGLED OUT FOR BEING 
TOO BLITHE TOWARDS RISK ASSESSMENT, BUT SERRA ALSO CRITICIZES 
THE SOMETIMES-IRRATIONAL OPPOSITION OF ANTI-GM ORGANIZATIONS. 
 SECONDLY, SERRA SOLICITS GREATER CONSIDERATION OF THE RISKS 
TO BIODIVERSITY, GIVING EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES LIKE ITALY AND 
INDIA THAT PRODUCE MOST OF THEIR FOOD FROM 10 OR SO STRAINS 
OF RICE, GRAIN AND CORN. SERRA CALLS FOR ATTENTIVE AND 
DETAILED OBSERVATION OF AREAS WHERE GMO ORGANISMS HAVE BEEN 
INTRODUCED TO AVOID THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY THAT MAY IN TURN 
ADVERSELY AFFECT HUMAN BEINGS. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02268  01 OF 03  100539Z 
5.  (U) SERRA\'S THIRD \"RISK\" DEALS WITH THE SOCIAL 
REPERCUSSIONS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY ECONOMICS AND 
EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. HE QUOTES FIGURES THAT PUT 81 PERCENT 
OF THE GLOBAL AGROCHEMICAL MARKET AND 37 PERCENT OF THE 
GLOBAL SEED MARKET IN THE HANDS OF TEN COMPANIES.  SERRA 
LAMENTS THE PRODUCTION OF STERILE PATENTED SEEDS BECAUSE IT 
CONCENTRATES GREAT WEALTH IN A FEW HANDS AND THREATENS THE 
SURVIVAL OF THE POOREST.  HE CALLS FOR STRATEGIES THAT ENSURE 
AN EQUITABLE ECONOMIC \"EVENING OUT\" THAT FAVOR THE POOREST. 
 
6.  (U) SERRA CONCLUDES BY DESCRIBING PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY\'S 
GOAL AS \"THE PERFECT\", THE MEANS USED BY GENETIC ENGINEERING 
TO REACH THIS GOAL AS \"EXTRAORDINARY,\" THE RESULTS AS 
\"PROMISING,\" BUT THAT ITS CONSEQUENCES NEED ACCURATE ETHICAL 
REFLECTION. (NOTE: SERRA\'S VIEWS TRACK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE 
VIEWS WE HAVE HEARD BOTH PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY FROM KEY 
VATICAN INTERLOCUTORS IN THIS DISCUSSION, E.G., BISHOP 
SGRECCIA AND ARCHBISHOP MARCHETTO END NOTE.)

PRESIDENT, PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE. SGRECCIA IS THE TOP 
VATICAN ETHICIST SPECIALIZING IN BIOTECHNOLOGY, MEDICAL 
ETHICS, HEALTH AND FAMILY ISSUES. HIS APPROACH TO 
BIOTECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM - THE THEORETICAL 
BENEFITS NEED TO BE BALANCED BY ADEQUATE RESEARCH AND PATIENT 
OBSERVATION. LIKE ALL VATICAN OFFICIALS HE LOOKS TO THE

BIOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES. THE ACADEMY FOR LIFE HAS PUBLISHED 
THE VATICAN\'S CLEAREST POSITION TO DATE ON BIOTECHNOLOGY. 
SGRECCIA WAS EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF AN EMBASSY INITIATIVE 
THAT BROUGHT U.S. BIOTECHNOLOGIST, C.S. PRAKASH, AND VATICAN

SECRETARY OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE PASTORAL CARE OF 
 
SIPDIS 
MIGRANTS AND ITINERANTS. HE ENTERED THE HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC 
SERVICE IN 1968, AND SERVED IN A NUMBER OF SUB-SAHARAN 
NUNCIATURES. MARCHETTO IS THE CLASSIC EUROPEAN BIOTECHNOLOGY 
SKEPTIC. HIS POSITION APPEARS BASED MORE ON POPULAR 
PERCEPTIONS OF GMOS THAN ON GOOD SCIENCE. HE RELISHES PLAYING 
THE DEVIL\'S ADVOCATE AND CONCENTRATING ON THE \"WHAT IFS.\" 
YET, LIKE THE REST OF THE HOLY SEE, HIS PRIMARY MOTIVATION IS 
SERVING HUMANITY.  IF HE CAN BE PERSUADED THAT GMOS PRESENT A 
NET BENEFIT, HE WOULD BE A POWERFUL ADVOCATE FOR THEM. 
 
9.  (C)  GENERALLY POSITIVE:  ARCHBISHOP DIARMUID MARTIN, 
PERMANENT OBSERVER, UN OFFICES AND SPECIALIST AGENCIES, 
GENEVA. MARTIN, A FORMER IV VISITOR, IS NOT A PROFESSIONALLY 
TRAINED VATICAN DIPLOMAT AND THUS UNTAINTED BY THE PALL OF 
\"SUPER CAUTION.\" HE CALLS A SPADE A SPADE AND APPRECIATES 
GOOD SCIENCE. HE WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT ALLY ON THE BIOTECH 
INTERNATIONAL PLAYING FIELD. HIS REPUTATION IN WORLD TRADE 
AND MONETARY CIRCLES IS HIGH, MAKING HIM POTENTIALLY 
INFLUENTIAL WITH DEVELOPING NATIONS. MARTIN\'S FOCUS ON HUMAN

RIGHTS ISSUES IN GENEVA COULD BE AN ENTRY POINT FOR THE 
PROMOTION OF BIOTECH BENEFITS. 
 
10.  (C)  GENERALLY POSITIVE: MONSIGNOR CELESTINO MIGLIORE, 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER. MIGLIORE WILL LIKELY BE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR GIVING THE WORKING LEVEL \"OK\" TO MOST BIOTECHNOLOGY 
INITIATIVES. AS IS MARTIN, MIGLIORE IS PRAGMATIC AND 
STRAIGHTFORWARD. ONE OF THE EMBASSY\'S MOST ACCESSIBLE 
HIGH-LEVEL INTERLOCUTORS, WE CAN EXPECT HIM TO BE REASONABLE. 
 HE HAS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF THE PROBLEMS CAUSED IN 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BY MALNUTRITION AND CROP FAILURE. HE 
SERVED AT THE NUNCIATURE IN WASHINGTON DURING THE 1990S AND 
WOULD BE OPEN TO THE BENEFITS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, BUT HE WOULD 
ALSO INSIST ON ADEQUATE PRECAUTIONS BEFORE GIVING HIS \"NULLA 
OSTA\". (NOTE: IT IS CLASSIC VATICAN STRATEGY TO NOT MAKE A 
MOVE BEFORE RECEIVING PERMISSION -- THE \"NULLA OSTA\" -- FROM 
ONE\'S SUPERIORS. THIS STIFLES INITIATIVE AND GIVES UNDUE 
EMPHASIS TO THE CAUTIONARY APPROACH. THIS APPLIES TO ALL OF 
THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PERSONS. END NOTE.)

11.  (SBU)  THE VATICAN IS POTENTIALLY A VALUABLE ALLY IN THE 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT TO PROMOTE BROADER ACCEPTANCE OF 
BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GMOS AMONG OUR KEY TRADING PARTNERS. ITS 
MORAL CLOUT STILL INFLUENCES MANY NATIONS IN THE EU, AND 
PARTICULARLY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, WHERE, IN CERTAIN 
INSTANCES, INDIVIDUAL CLERGY ANTAGONISTIC TO PROFIT-MAKING 
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS HELP BEAT THE ANTI-GMO DRUMS.

VATICAN BACKING FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GMOS AS A MEANS TO FEED 
THE WORLD\'S POOR WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CHANGING 
THE GENERALLY FEARFUL EUROPEAN MINDSET BY UNDERCUTTING A KEY 
RATIONALE OF ANTI-BIOTECH ACTIVISTS (THAT U.S. COMPANIES WILL 
DISPLACE TRADITIONAL METHODS OF AGRICULTURE ACROSS THE 
WORLD).  POST\'S EFFORTS TO EXPOSE VATICAN PROTAGONISTS TO THE 
SCIENCE HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JULY 
2001 WE ORGANIZED A PANEL DISCUSSION BETWEEN VISITING GMO 
EXPERT C.S. PRAKASH OF TUSKEEGEE UNIVERSITY AND MEMBERS OF 
THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY OF THE SCIENCES (PAS) AND THE 
PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE (PAL).  AMBASSADOR FOLLOWED THAT

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (A) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS, DCM 
MET SEPARATELY WITH FATHER MARCEL GUARNIZO,     PRESIDENT OF 
THE AID TO THE CHURCH IN RUSSIA, FATHER FILIPP OF THE RUSSIAN 
ORTHODOX CHURCH IN ROME, AND DIMITRI SHTODIN, DCM AT THE

PAGE 02        VATICA  02291  01 OF 02  101502Z 
RUSSIAN EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE.  ALL ASSERT THAT 
RUSSIAN/VATICAN RELATIONS ARE AT A 10-YEAR LOW.  FATHER 
MARCEL BLAMES IT ON THE INCREASING INSECURITY OF PATRIARCH 
ALEXI AND RUSSIAN ORTHODOX \"FOREIGN MINISTER\" KYRILL. FATHER 
FILIPP STATES THAT THE PROBLEM IS THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S 
\"AGGRESSIVE\" PROSELYTISM, WHILE SHTODIN SEES IT AS A 
MANIFESTATION OF AN ETHNIC RUSSIAN/ETHNIC POLE CONFRONTATION 
WITHIN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.  NONE OF THE THREE SEE ANY 
SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENT.  END SUMMARY 
 
THE VIEW OF THE RUSSIAN CHURCH IN ROME 
 
2. (C) THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH IN ROME WAS A SMALL, 
DISCREET CONGREGATION UNTIL THE LATE 1980\'S.  FOUNDED BY 
\"WHITE RUSSIANS\", IT USE TO EASILY ACCOMMODATE ITS LESS THAN 
300 MEMBERS IN ITS CHURCH LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF ROME. 
HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE INFLUX OF SERBS, RUSSIANS, AND 
UKRAINIANS INTO ROME SINCE THE EARLY 1990\'S, THERE WERE OVER 
1,000 PEOPLE AT ORTHODOX EASTER SUNDAY MASS ON MAY 5, WITH 
THE OVERFLOW CROWD FILLING THE SURROUNDING STREETS.  THE 
CONGREGATION HOPES TO HAVE A SECOND CHURCH BUILDING ON THE 
RUSSIAN EMBASSY COMPOUND IN 2003, WHERE A LARGE CHURCH IS 
CURRENTLY BEING CONSTRUCTED.  THERE ARE THREE PRIESTS AT THE 
CHURCH, FATHER FILIPP, FATHER MIKAIL, AND FATHER ALEKSEY. DCM 
MET MOST RECENTLY WITH FATHER FILIPP ON MAY 6 TO DISCUSS HIS 
PARTICIPATION IN EMBASSY\'S MAY 15-16 ANTI TRAFFICKING 
CONFERENCE.  FATHER FILIPP AGAIN USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
COMPLAIN ABOUT VATICAN ACTIONS IN RUSSIA.  HE SAID THAT THERE 
WILL BE NO IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS UNTIL POPE JOHN PAUL II 
\"LEAVES THE SCENE\".  HE SAID THAT THE CREATION OF CATHOLIC 
DIOCESE IN RUSSIA WAS A GREAT \"INSULT\" TO THE RUSSIAN CHURCH. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  02291  01 OF 02  101502Z 
 WHEN ASKED IF THESE WERE NOT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE PASTORAL 
CARE FOR CATHOLICS LIVING IN RUSSIA, HE REPLIED THAT THIS 
ARGUMENT IS A VATICAN \"LIE\" AND COVER FOR AGGRESSIVE 
PROSTYELATION OF RUSSIANS.  HE DESCRIBED RELATIONS AS WORSE 
THAN ANYTIME IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. 
 
VIEW OF THE EMBASSY OF RUSSIA TO THE HOLY SEE 
 
3. (C) DURING SEVERAL ENCOUNTERS WITH RUSSIAN EMBASSY DCM 
SHTODIN, DCM RAISED STATE OF RUSSIAN/VATICAN RELATIONS. 
SHTODIN, WHO VOLUNTEERED THAT HE IS A NON BELIEVER AND DID 
NOT FEEL PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, AGREED 
ENTIRELY WITH THE SENTIMENTS VOICED BY FATHER FILIPP. HE SAW 
NOT ONLY THE CREATION OF DIOCESES AS AN AFFRONT, BUT WHAT HE 
DESCRIBED AS THE RECENT VATICAN \"VIRTUAL INVASION\" OF MOSCOW. 
 ACCORDING TO SHTODIN, THE RUSSIANS WERE INFORMED THAT THE 
VATICAN WOULD DO A LIVE VIDEO LINK FOR THE POPE WITH 
SEMINARIANS AT THE CATHEDRAL IN MOSCOW.  THE ARCHBISHOP OF 
MOSCOW, AGAIN ACCORDING TO SHTODIN, MADE IT A PUBLIC EVENT. 
SHTODIN SEES BOTH ETHNICITY AND POLITICS AT WORK ON THE 
VATICAN SIDE.  HE SAID THAT A MAJORITY OF ROMAN CATHOLICS IN 
RUSSIA ARE ETHNIC POLES, AND THAT THOSE IN THE VATICAN WHO 
WANT TO RETARD PROGRESS IN VATICAN/RUSSIA RELATIONS ARE 
TELLING THE POPE THAT HIS CO-NATIONALS IN RUSSIA ARE BEING 
PERSECUTED AND THE VATICAN SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE AN 
AGGRESSIVE STAND.      HE SINGLED OUT PRIME MINISTER SODANO 
AS BEHIND THESE ACTIONS, NOT BECAUSE HE\'S CONCERNED WITH 
POLISH CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA, BUT TO GAIN SUPPORT IN 
ANTICIPATION OF THE NEXT CONCLAVE AMONG CARDINALS LOYAL TO 
JOHN PAUL. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

A ROMAN CATHOLIC\'S VIEW 
 
4. (C) FATHER MARCEL, PRESIDENT OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED 
\"AID TO THE CHURCH IN RUSSIA\",  CALLED ON DCM ON    MAY 1. 
HE SAID THAT PERSECUTION OF ROMAN CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA IS AT 
ITS WORST LEVEL SINCE THE FALL OF COMMUNISM.  HE CLAIMED THAT 
THERE IS NO PROSELYTIZING, BUT IF AN ETHNIC RUSSIAN WANTS TO 
INVESTIGATE CATHOLICISM \"HE MUST BE RECEIVED\".  MARCEL 
STRESSED THAT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PASTORAL SUPPORT FOR 
ROMAN CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA, IT IS NECESSARY FOR FOREIGN 
BISHOPS AND PRIESTS TO BE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.  HE 
MADE A STRONG PLEA FOR PRESIDENT BUSH TO MEET ARCHBISHOP 
TADEUSZ KONDRUSIEWICZ OF MOSCOW DURING THE PRESIDENT\'S 
UPCOMING TRIP TO RUSSIA. 
 
COMMENT:  POST WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING FROM EMBASSY MOSCOW 
IF SHTODIN\'S PERSPECTIVE IS SHARED BY MANY IN THE GOI. 
EMBASSY VATICAN IS CONVINCED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS LEGITIMATE 
PASTORAL CONCERNS IN RUSSIA WHICH NECESSITATE THE PRESENCE OF 
FOREIGN PRIESTS.  THAT SAID, THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT 
THE VATICAN IS CALLING FOR A GREATER NUMBER OF PRIESTS PER 
CATHOLIC CONGREGANTS THAN IS THE NORM IN WESTERN EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES.  AGAIN, EMBASSY MOSCOW\'S VIEW WOULD BE WELCOMED.

HOLY SEE, GAVE DCM HIS EMBASSY\'S PERSPECTIVE OF THE MAY 10 
MEETING AMONG ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER PERES, VATICAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER-EQUIVALENT TAURAN, AND VATICAN PRIME 
MINISTER-EQUIVALENT SODANO.  TAL\'S VIEWS ARE BASED ON A 
READ-OUT OF THE MEETING HE RECEIVED FROM HIS AMBASSADOR,

2. (S) ACCORDING TO TAL, MEETING WAS MORE OF A BRIEFING ON 
THE PART OF PERES, THAN AN ACTUAL EXCHANGE OF VIEWS.  THE ONE 
ISSUE OF ACTUAL DISCUSSION WAS THE ROLE OF ARAFAT AS A 
PARTNER IN THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.  PERES SAID THAT ARAFAT 
STILL HAD TO PROVE HE IS A SERIOUS PARTNER AND COULD CONTROL 
THE VIOLENCE; PERES SAID THAT THE GOI WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIM 
A CHANCE.  SODANO INSISTED, HOWEVER, THAT ARAFAT IS THE 
LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, AND AS 
SUCH MUST BE THE INDIVIDUAL WITH WHOM THE ISRAELIS ENGAGE. 
 
3.(S) THE ISRAELI SIDE WAS MOST SURPRISED THAT THE VATICAN 
RAISED THE SITUATION IN BETHLEHEM ONLY IN PASSING.  TAL 
REPORTED THAT SODANO \"EXPRESSED SATISFACTION\" THAT THE 
SITUATION HAS BEEN RESOLVED, BUT \"TRUE TO FORM\" OFFERED NO 
WORDS OF THANKS TO THE ISRAELIS.  SODANO \"REHASHED\" THE 
VATICAN POSITION ON \"TWO PEOPLES/TWO STATES\", AS WELL AS THE 
NEED FOR DISCUSSIONS ON JERUSALEM.  TAL SAID, \"TO BE FAIR\" 
NEITHER SODANO NOR TAURAN EXPRESSED SERIOUS ANNOYANCE WITH 
THE ISRAELI MILITARY ACTION, AND ALLOWED PERES TO EXPLAIN HOW 
THE ACTION HAS SUCCEEDED IN DISMANTLING MUCH OF THE TERRORIST 
INFRASTRUCTURE. 
 
4.(S) TAL SAID THAT IN THE RIDE BACK FROM THE MEETING, PERES 
TOLD LAMDAN THAT ISRAELI/VATICAN RELATIONS ARE \"NOT AS BAD\" 
AS EVERYONE BELIEVES.

). 
 
 1. (C) SUMMARY: PLANS ARE AFOOT FOR TAIWAN PRESIDENT CHEN TO 
TRANSIT ITALY THIS JULY ON TRAVEL FROM TAIPEI TO AFRICA, 
ACCORDING TO TAIWAN EMBOFF, YET THE VATICAN IS NOT PUTTING 
OUT THE RED CARPET.  TAIWAN FM EUGENE Y.H. CHIEN MET MAY 30 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  02901  140953Z 
WITH VATICAN FM ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN, YET REACHED NO 
AGREEMENT ON VATICAN MEETINGS FOR PRESIDENT CHEN. BEHIND 
CLOSED DOORS, THE VATICAN PROTESTED TAIWAN DOMESTIC POLICIES 
THAT IT BELIEVES BLOCK CHURCH EXPANSION. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
1. (C)TAIWAN EMBOFF PETER TING TOLD POLOFF JUNE 5 THAT TAIWAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER EUGENE Y.H. CHIEN\'S MAY 30 MEETING WITH 
VATICAN FM JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN BROUGHT WHAT HE CALLED THORNY 
BILATERAL ISSUES TO THE FORE.  FM TAURAN LODGED A COMPLAINT 
ABOUT TAIPEI\'S DELISTING OF DECEMBER 25 AS A TAIWAN NATIONAL 
HOLIDAY (PREVIOUSLY JUSTIFIED TO COMMEMORATE THE PROMULGATION 
OF THE 1936 CONSTITUTION.)  TAURAN FURTHER PROTESTED TAIPEI 
ZONING LAWS WHICH, THE VATICAN CLAIMS, IMPEDE CONSTRUCTION OF 
NEW SEMINARIES. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE WAS NO VATICAN 
AGREEMENT FOR MEETINGS WITH TAIWAN PRESIDENT CHEN SHUI-BIAN 
SHOULD HE TRANSIT ITALY IN JULY. 
 
2.  (C) TAIWAN PRESIDENT CHEN IS TENTATIVELY PLANNING A VISIT 
TO AFRICA IN JULY THAT WOULD INCLUDE TRANSIT TRAVEL THROUGH 
INDIA AND ITALY, ACCORDING TO TAIWAN EMBOFF.  TAIWAN, WHICH 
ENJOYS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE VATICAN, WOULD NORMALLY 
SEEK A VISIT, YET THE VATICAN, TING SAID, HAS NOT BEEN 
ENCOURAGING.  CONSEQUENTLY, TAIWAN WAS NOW THINKING IN TERMS 
OF AN OVERNIGHT AIRPORT STOP AT MILAN AND A PRIVATE DINNER, 
POSSIBLY WITH PROMINENT VATICAN OR GOI LEADERS, ACCORDING TO 
TING. 
 
3.  TAIWAN FM CHIEN ALSO SAW FORMER VATICAN 
DFM ARCHBISHOP CLAUDIO CELLI.  CELLI, WHO AS DFM REACHED A 
BREAKTHROUGH AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM ON RELIGIOUS PRACTICE, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  02901  140953Z 
NOW HAS PRINCIPAL OVERSIGHT OF PRC-VATICAN DIALOG. TING SAID 
CHIEN AND CELLI DISCUSSED THE STATUS OF VATICAN-PRC DIALOG -- 
STALLED UNTIL THE PRC RESOLVES SUCCESSION OF PARTY LEADERSHIP 
-- AND LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR VATICAN-TAIWAN RELATIONS. 
SINCE 1999 VARIOUS VATICAN OFFICIALS HAVE VOCALLY REITERATED 
THE STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE (PRIME 
MINISTER-EQUIVALENT) CARDINAL SODANO THAT THE VATICAN IS 
READY TO DOWNGRADE TIES WITH TAIPEI OVERNIGHT IF BEIJING 
AGREES TO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  TING 
ADMITTED TAIWAN INCREASINGLY VIEWED THIS VATICAN STANCE WAS 
INSULTING, A MARKED DEPARTURE FROM THE GENERALLY CAUTIOUS AND 
POSITIVE COMMENTARY THAT HIS MISSION RESERVES FOR THE 
VATICAN, THE SOLE GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE TO RECOGNIZE TAIWAN. 
 
4.  COMMENT:  TAIWAN LATELY HAS BEEN TESTING THE LIMITS OF 
ITS VATICAN FRIENDSHIP AS WELL AS OF THE LATERAN ACCORDS, THE 
ITALIAN-VATICAN AGREEMENT THAT INTER ALIA REQUIRES ITALY 
GRANT TRANSIT VISAS FOR FOREIGN OFFICIALS ON VATICAN VISITS. 
TAIWAN VP ANNETTE LU SWUNG THROUGH THE  VATICAN IN MARCH FOR 
WHAT THE VATICAN\'S CHINA DESK OFFICER, MSGR. ROTA-GRAZIOSI, 
DISMISSED AS A MEANINGLESS CEREMONIAL MEETING WITH FM TAURAN. 
 FM CHIEN\'S MEETINGS ARE A PRELUDE TO AN ATTEMPTED 
PRESIDENTIAL VISIT THAT THE VATICAN IS UNLIKELY TO GRANT. 
THE VATICAN IS SUPPORTIVE OF ITS TAIWAN FRIENDS, YET WILL NOT 
BE PARTY TO GRATUITOUS PROVOCATIONS OF THE PRC, PARTICULARLY 
AMID THE RUN-UP TO THE PRC PARTY CONGRESS THIS FALL AND THE 
VATICAN\'S EVIDENT HOPE TO KICK-START DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS 
SOON THEREAFTER.

RUSSIAN PRIESTS NATIONWIDE.  THE VATICAN IS STILL SEEKING TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER THIS DRAFT HAS HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL SUPPORT 
OR IS THE WORK OF THE BUREAUCRACY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  DURING INCOMING DCM\'S JULY 12 COURTESY CALL ON 
VATICAN DFM CELESTINO MIGLIORE, MIGLIORE RAISED HIS CONCERN 
ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF DRAFT RUSSIAN RELIGIOUS VISA LAWS 
THAT WOULD REQUIRE RELIGIOUS WORKERS TO LEAVE RUSSIA EVERY 
THREE MONTHS TO RENEW THEIR STATUS.  HE SAID IT USUALLY TAKES 
A MONTH FOR THOSE VISAS TO BE PROCESSED, AND WOULD REQUIRE 
PRIESTS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS WORKERS FROM POLAND, THE 
PHILIPPINES AND OTHER COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN TO LEAVE THEIR 
PARISHES FOR ONE MONTH OUT OF EVERY FOUR AT GREAT EXPENSE AND 
LOSS OF TIME. IN EFFECT, HE SAID, THE DECREE IS \"JUST LIKE 
SAYING CLOSE DOWN YOUR ACTIVITIES.\"  MIGLIORE WAS ALSO 
CONCERNED THAT THE GOR HAS LISTED A FURTHER 15 RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS \"TO BE EXPELLED.\" 
 
3.  (C)  ASKED WHETHER BISHOP MAZUR (PREVIOUSLY DENIED A VISA 
TO RETURN TO THE DIOCESE OF SAKHALIN -- SEE REFTEL) HAD HEARD 
ANY NEWS ABOUT THE RENEWAL OF HIS VISA, MIGLIORE SAID THE 
HOLY SEE HAD NOT EVEN HEARD FROM THE GOR THE LEGAL BASIS FOR 
HIS VISA REFUSAL.  MAZUR CONTINUES TO COOL HIS HEELS IN 
POLAND.  HE INDICATED THAT THERE IS A REAL RISK THAT THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S ACTIVITIES IN IRKUTSK WOULD HAVE TO CEASE 
IF MAZUR DOESN\'T GET HIS VISA AND IF THE NEW DECREE COMES 
INTO FORCE.  HE SAID THAT WHEN THE HOLY SEE ATTEMPTS TO 
DISCUSS THESE ISSUES IN MOSCOW, THEY ARE TOLD THAT \"LOWER 
LEVEL OFFICIALS\" ARE RESPONSIBLE, BUT NEVERTHELESS, THE 
CHURCH\'S CLERGY ARE STILL DENIED THE CHANCE TO CONDUCT THEIR 
PASTORAL WORK.

PAGE 03        VATICA  03492  151244Z 
 
4. (C)  COMMENT:   MIGLIORE\'S COMMENTS ABOUT THIS NEW RUSSIAN 
DECREE INDICATED A NEW LEVEL OF CONCERN WITHIN THE VATICAN 
FOR THEIR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN RUSSIA.  MIGLIORE RAISED THE 
ISSUE IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE HOLY SEE\'S CURRENT 
INTERNATIONAL PRIORITIES, GIVING IT TOP BILLING.  THE NEW 
DRAFT LAW COMES ON THE HEELS OF A VITUPERATIVE STATEMENT BY 
THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH\'S SPOKESMAN FOR EXTERNAL 
RELATIONS, ARCHPRIEST VSEVOLOD CHAPLIN JULY 5 IN WHICH HE 
CONDEMNED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S COMPETITIVE APPROACH AS 
\"EXPANSION AT ANY PRICE,\" AND ASSERTED THAT THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH HAS HAD \"ALMOST ZERO SUCCESS.\"  WE WOULD APPRECIATE 
EMBASSY MOSCOW\'S TAKE ON WHETHER THERE IS A REAL THREAT THAT 
THE CHURCH\'S OPERATIONS COULD BE \"SHUT DOWN\" OR OTHERWISE 
SERIOUSLY IMPEDED BY THE NEW DRAFT LAW AND WHETHER THIS 
REPRESENTS A NEW ESCALATION IN THE TENSE RELATIONS BETWEEN 
THE TWO CHURCHES.  WITH VATICAN MFA COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR 
RUSSIAN/NIS ISSUES ARCHBISHOP TRICARICO SOON TO RETIRE, THE 
VATICAN IS THIN ON PERSONNEL AND NOT WELL POSITIONED TO PUSH 
ITS INTEREST IN THIS AREA.

1. (C)  SUMMARY:  VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER MIGLIORE 
TOLD DCM JULY 12 THAT USG MARGINALIZATION OF ARAFAT WILL 
LIKELY EMPOWER HAMAS AND THEREBY JUSTIFY ISRAEL PM SHARON\'S 
PLAN TO SEEK A MILITARY SOLUTION.  THE VATICAN BELIEVES 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

ARAFAT\'S PRESENCE CAN STILL LIMIT HAMAS\' APPEAL. ACCORDING TO 
MIGLIORE, THE VATICAN SUPPORTS AN INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING 
FORCE FOR THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES, AND WOULD SEEK A SEAT 
AT ANY INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE FOR THE MIDDLE EAST. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  DURING INCOMING DCM\'S JULY 12 COURTESY CALL ON 
VATICAN DFM CELESTINO MIGLIORE, MIGLIORE RAISED HIS CONCERN 
AT USG POLICY CALLING FOR NEW LEADERSHIP OF THE PALESTINIAN 
AUTHORITY.  MIGLIORE SAID THE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN CONFLICT 
REMAINS OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE HOLY SEE, WHICH WISHES TO SEE 
AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CONVENED AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. 
WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING ARAFAT\'S SHORTCOMINGS. HE AVERRED THAT 
ARAFAT REMAINS A USEFUL RALLYING SYMBOL FOR PALESTINIANS.  TO 
MOVE HIM OUT NOW WOULD ONLY PAVE THE WAY FOR MORE RADICAL 
ELEMENTS SUCH AS HAMAS, HE PREDICTED.  DRAWING THE THREAD OUT 
FURTHER, MIGLIORE SAID MARGINALIZING ARAFAT WOULD BE A \"GIFT 
TO SHARON,\" WHO WOULD THEN BE FREE TO PURSUE THE MILITARY 
CAMPAIGN THAT THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES HE HAS WANTED ALL ALONG 
-- AND SOMETHING THE HOLY SEE CATEGORICALLY REJECTS. 
 
3.  (C)  MIGLIORE RECALLED THAT SECRETARY POWELL TOLD VATICAN 
PM EQUIVALENT CARDINAL SODANO DURING THE PRESIDENT\'S JUNE 
VATICAN VISIT THAT THERE WAS NO CURRENT PLANNING FOR A 
CONFERENCE TO EXPLORE WAYS TO MOVE THE PEACE PROCESS FORWARD. 
 MIGLIORE UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING IDEAS FOR 
MOVING THE PROCESS FORWARD.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAS ITS OWN 
IDEAS, BUT NO PLAN AS SUCH, OTHER THAN ITS \"CLEAR AND 
SPECIFIC POLICY OF SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION FOR 
THE HOLY PLACES IN JERUSALEM.\"  HE DID REMIND US OF THE HOLY 
SEE\'S STANDING SUPPORT FOR AN INTERNATIONAL INTER-POSITIONAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03503  151458Z 
FORCE TO STOP THE VIOLENCE, AND NOW ITS STRONG INTEREST IN AN 
OBSERVER ROLE IN ANY INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE MEPP. 
 
4.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE LEITMOTIF OF HOLY SEE FOREIGN POLICY 
IS DEFENSE OF THE HUMAN PERSON THROUGH PEACE, DIALOGUE, AND 
SOLIDARITY.  THE VATICAN IS FEARFUL THAT THE PACE AND LEVEL 
OF VIOLENCE IN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES HAS 
DULLED PEOPLES\' SENSES, AND THAT VIOLENCE WILL TURN WORSE 
BEFORE IT EASES (IN FACT, FM TAURAN EXPRESSED THESE FEARS TO 
US WHEN THE CURRENT INTIFADA BEGAN IN LATE 2000).  ARAFAT, AS 
DIFFICULT AS HE IS, HAS BEEN A REGULAR VISITOR AT THE HOLY 
SEE AND IS SOMEONE THE VATICAN FEELS IT CAN WORK WITH TO 
PROTECT THE CHRISTIAN HOLY SITES.  THE VATICAN NOW SEES ITS 
INTERESTS THREATENED EVER MORE BY A POSSIBLE TURN AMONG 
PALESTINIANS TO ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST LEADERSHIP IF ARAFAT 
GOES.

SEE\'S ATTEMPTS AT DIALOGUE WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH 
(ROC) ARE IN A DIFFICULT MOMENT AND NOT ADVANCING.  KASPER 
TOLD INCOMING DCM THAT THE ROC REMAINS TOO NATIONALISTIC AND 
FALSELY PERCEIVES AS A THREAT THE TINY MINORITY OF CATHOLICS 
IN RUSSIA -- JUST OVER 251,000 BAPTIZED CATHOLICS.  ACCORDING 
TO KASPER, THE POPE IS NOW RESIGNED TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE 
WILL NEVER VISIT RUSSIA.  THE ROC NEVERTHELESS CONTINUES A 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH VARIOUS CATHOLIC INDIVIDUALS AND 
AGENCIES - NOTABLY THOSE THAT FUND ROC ACTIVITIES.  DESPITE

2.  (C)  INCOMING DCM PAID A CALL JULY 16 ON CARDINAL WALTER 
KASPER, PREFECT OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR PROMOTING 
CHRISTIAN UNITY.  QUERIED ON THE STATE OF CATHOLIC/RUSSIAN 
ORTHODOX DIALOGUE, KASPER CONCEDED THAT IT WAS STALLED.  HE 
SHARED VATICAN DFM  MIGLIORE\'S CONCERNS (REF B) AT THE GOR 
REFUSAL OF VISAS TO CATHOLIC CLERGY -- ESPECIALLY BISHOP 
MAZUR.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD SENT A FORMAL, WRITTEN QUERY 
FROM THE POPE TO PRESIDENT PUTIN SIX WEEKS AGO ASKING FOR 
CLARIFICATION OF THE GROUNDS OF THAT VISA REFUSAL, BUT AS OF 
YET HAD HAD NO RESPONSE (SOMETHING HE CHARACTERIZED AS 
EXTRAORDINARY, UNDIPLOMATIC AND IMPOLITE).  HE ALSO EXPRESSED 
DISMAY AT THE RECENT HARSH RHETORIC COMING FROM THE RUSSIAN 
PATRIARCH\'S SPOKESMAN ACCUSING THE CATHOLIC CHURCH OF 
COMPETING WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

--------------------------------- 
RUSSIAN FEARS, VATICAN ASSURANCES 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  CARDINAL KASPER SAID THAT THERE WERE MANY REASONS 
FOR THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN HOLY SEE/RUSSIAN ORTHODOX 
DIALOGUE: THE ROC IS \"TOO NATIONALISTIC,\" UNFOUNDED FEARS OF 
A CATHOLIC THREAT TO ROC POWER AND INFLUENCE FROM THE 251,000 
(BAPTIZED) CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA (VS. 105 MILLION RUSSIAN 
CITIZENS), AND \"HISTORICAL\" CONCERNS RELATING TO 
POLISH/RUSSIAN CONFLICTS IN CENTURIES PAST.   (NOTE: IN REF A 
WE REPORTED VATICAN NIS COUNTRY DIRECTOR TRICARICO\'S MORE 
UNVARNISHED ASSESSMENT: \"THEY ARE ALL FORMER COLLABORATORS 
WHO HAVEN\'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE OLD HABITS.\" END NOTE.) 
KASPER REPEATED THE VATICAN ASSERTION THAT THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT \"PROSELYTIZE\" IN RUSSIA.  HE SAID 
THE CHURCH WOULD NOT TURN AWAY A RUSSIAN WHO IN GOOD 
CONSCIENCE SOUGHT TO JOIN, AS THIS WAS A MATTER OF FREEDOM OF 
RELIGION.  BUT HE POINTED OUT THAT EVEN THE NUNS WHO CARE FOR 
RUSSIAN ORPHANS ENSURE THAT THOSE CHILDREN GO TO ORTHODOX, 
NOT CATHOLIC, CHURCHES EVERY SUNDAY.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
SOME CATHOLICS MAY HAVE BEEN OVERZEALOUS, AS WERE SOME 
ORTHODOX.  BUT THAT WAS NOT VATICAN POLICY. 
 
4.  (C)  KASPER EXPLAINED THAT THE RECENT CREATION OF FOUR 
DIOCESES IN RUSSIA WAS NO MORE DECLARING RUSSIA TO BE 
\"VATICAN TERRITORY\" THAN WAS DECLARING THE 300-PLUS DIOCESES 
IN THE U.S.A. TO BE VATICAN TERRITORY.  HE SAID THE CHURCH 
HAD AN APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATION IN RUSSIA IN CZARIST TIMES. 
THE RENEWED APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATIONS IN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  03527  01 OF 02  170549Z 
AFTER 1990 HAD ONLY BEEN TEMPORARY MEASURES.  ELEVATING THOSE 
AREAS TO DIOCESES WAS NEEDED TO PROVIDE PASTORAL CARE TO THE 
LARGELY ETHNIC POLES, LITHUANIAN, AND OTHER MINORITIES THAT 
HAD BEEN DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE SOVIET UNION BY STALIN. 
 
------------------------------------- 
POPE GIVING UP HOPE ON A MOSCOW VISIT 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  ASKED WHETHER THE POPE STILL HOPED TO VISIT MOSCOW, 
KASPER REPLIED THAT IN HIS VIEW THE POPE HAD COME TO TERMS 
WITH THE FACT THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET 
WITH RUSSIAN PATRIARCH ALEXIY AND HAD GIVEN UP ON THAT 
\"DREAM.\"  IT WAS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING TO THE PONTIFF 
BECAUSE HE HAD MET WITH ALL OF THE OTHER ORTHODOX PATRIARCHS 
AND HAD BEGUN TO BUILD BRIDGES.  KASPER THOUGHT THAT AS 
FELLOW SLAVS, THE POPE AND ALEXIY WOULD HAVE A COMMON 
VOCABULARY FOR LAUNCHING AN HISTORIC RECONCILIATION.  ALAS, 
IT NOW APPEARS THIS BRIDGE WOULD HAVE TO BE BUILT UNDER

6. (C)  NOTWITHSTANDING CURRENT OBSTACLES, KASPER MADE CLEAR 
THAT THE CHURCH WOULD BE PATIENT AND \"KEEP ITS DOORS OPEN TO 
THE ORTHODOX.\"  KASPER NOTED (INNOCENTLY RATHER THAN 
IRONICALLY) THAT ALTHOUGH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH WON\'T 
TALK TO THE HOLY SEE, IT DOES HAVE FRUITFUL CONTACTS WITH 
CATHOLIC INDIVIDUALS AND AGENCIES -- ESPECIALLY THOSE, LIKE 
THE SEVERAL GERMAN CHURCH FUNDING AGENCIES, WHICH PROVIDE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  03527  02 OF 02  170550Z 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR ROC OPERATIONS AND ASSISTANCE.  HE 
ALSO NOTED THE CATHOLIC/ORTHODOX DIALOGUE WORKS WELL IN 
WESTERN COUNTRIES, WHICH KASPER ASCRIBED TO A MORE MODERN AND 
OPEN WORLDVIEW OF MOST CITIZENS IN THE WEST. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) KASPER\'S ASSERTION THAT THE POPE HAD GIVEN UP ON 
VISITING MOSCOW WAS THE STRONGEST AFFIRMATION WE HAVE HAD 
FROM A SENIOR CURIAL OFFICIAL THAT THE POPE HAS ACCEPTED THE 
PROBABILITY THAT HE WILL NOT FULFILL HIS VISION OF OUTREACH 
TO THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  HE CONVEYED A STRONG SENSE 
THAT HE AND THE POPE WERE TROUBLED BY THE HARDNESS OF RUSSIAN 
ORTHODOX ATTITUDES, AND THAT HE WAS UNCERTAIN HOW TO OVERCOME 
THEM.  \"IF PUTIN AND BUSH CAN COME TOGETHER,\" HE WONDERED, 
\"WHY CAN\'T THE PATRIARCH AND THE POPE?\"  KASPER AGREED THAT 
CHANGES WOULD PROBABLY COME ONLY WHEN RUSSIA WAS BETTER 
INTEGRATED WITH THE WEST AND HAD COME TO ACCEPT WESTERN NORMS 
ON FREEDOM OF RELIGION. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  THE COUNCIL FOR PROMOTING 
CHRISTIAN UNITY ORIGINATED IN THE VATICAN II REFORMS AND IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROMOTING DIALOGUE AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING 
WITH OTHER CHRISTIAN DENOMINATIONS AS WELL AS WITH THE JEWISH 
FAITH.  CONSERVATIVES WITHIN THE ROMAN CURIA BELIEVE THE IDEA 
OF DIALOGUE AS EQUALS WITH OTHER DENOMINATIONS VIOLATES CORE 
PRECEPTS OF CATHOLICISM, AND THUS THEY ARE EQUIVOCAL ABOUT 
THE COUNCIL\'S WORK.  KASPER IS AN IMPORTANT THINKER ON THE 
CHURCH\'S ROLE IN THE WORLD, AND FREQUENTLY ADDRESSES THE NEED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03527  02 OF 02  170550Z 
FOR BROADER DIALOGUE AMONG DIFFERENT FAITHS -- WHICH IS 
TECHNICALLY OUTSIDE OF HIS BRIEF.  OUR SANT\'EGIDIO FRIENDS, 
WHO HELP ORGANIZE THE POPE\'S EPISODIC INTERFAITH DAYS OF 
PRAYER (MOST RECENTLY IN ASSISI IN JANUARY), TELL US THEY 
BELIEVE KASPER IS ONE OF THE FEW SENIOR CURIA OFFICIALS WHO 
\"GET IT\" ON INTERFAITH DIALOGUE AND THE NEED TO TALK TO EVEN 
THE MOST DIFFICULT INTERLOCUTORS IF THE CHURCH IS TO AVOID 
THE MUCH FEARED \"CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS.\"  END COMMENT.

TO BEIJING.  AVERRING THAT NOT MUCH WILL HAPPEN BEFORE THE 
CCP PARTY CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER, ROTA-GRAZIOSI SEEMED 
RESIGNED TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YEARS WOULD PASS BEFORE 
PRC/HOLY SEE DIALOGUE WOULD BEAR FRUIT.  HE HELD LITTLE HOPE 
THAT BEIJING COULD BE PERSUADED OFFICIALLY TO REOPEN DIALOGUE 
WITH THE HOLY SEE, MUCH LESS TO CONCLUDE A SINO-VATICAN 
AGREEMENT BEFORE PRC PRESIDENT JIANG VISITS THE U.S. IN THE 
FALL. 
 
2.  (C)  ROTA-GRAZIOSI WAS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC, HOWEVER, ON 
THREE LIMITED STEPS THAT THE DRL/IRF DELEGATION MIGHT URGE 
THE PRC TO TAKE DURING THE DRL/IRF LATE JULY VISIT TO 
BEIJING.  FOR EXAMPLE THE PRC MIGHT HOST AN OFFICIAL 
DELEGATION FROM THE HOLY SEE.  HE SAID THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS 
PROPOSED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TO THE PRC THAT AN ENVOY BE 
ALLOWED TO MAKE AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHINA TO TRAVEL TO 
VARIOUS DIOCESES AND HOLD MEETINGS WITH CLERGY FROM BOTH THE 
OFFICIAL CHURCH AND THE UNDERGROUND CHURCH.  IN THE PAST, 
CARDINAL ETCHEGARRAY HAS VISITED, BUT ONLY AS A \"PRIVATE 
PERSON.\"  HE MUSED THAT AN OFFICIAL HOLY SEE VISITOR COULD BE 
QITHER CARDINAL OR BISHOP RANK, AND MIGHT EVEN CELEBRATE A 
MASS AT A CHINESE OFFICIAL CATHEDRAL \"AS A MARK OF 
SOLIDARITY.\"  ROTA-GRAZIOSI BELIEVED A LESS HIGH-PROFILE MOVE 
MIGHT BE PRC SUPPORT FOR WHAT THE POPE HAS CALLED A \"CULTURAL 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND CHINA,\" ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID 
THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE HAPPY TO COLLABORATE WITH BEIJING ON 
SOMETHING LIKE AN ART SHOW OF VATICAN MUSEUM PIECES, OR, MORE 
AMBITIOUSLY, A SYMPOSIUM TO DISCUSS VATICAN/CHINESE HISTORY. 
HE DID UNDERSCORE THAT IN THE PAST THE PRC HAD REFUSED TO 
ACCEPT EVEN A SINGLE WORK OF ART FROM THE VATICAN MUSEUM AS 
PART OF ANOTHER ART SHOW.  FINALLY, HE NOTED THAT IT WOULD

REOPEN ITS DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE, WHICH COULD START EVEN 
VIA INFORMAL INTERMEDIARIES SUCH AS THE U.S., ITALY, SPAIN, 
GERMANY, OR OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT:  ROTA-GRAZIOSI WAS SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF AND, 
CHARACTERISTICALLY CAUTIOUS AS A VATICAN OFFICIAL, WAS 
OBVIOUSLY NOT COMFORTABLE \"BRAINSTORMING\"  FOR POLOFFS.  IT 
IS NOT CERTAIN THAT ARCHBISHOP CELLI WOULD ENDORSE ANY OR ALL 
OF THESE IDEAS, SAVE THE LAST POINT.  THE HOLY SEE HAS 
CONSISTANTLY EXPRESSED ITS APPRECIATION TO US FOR THE WORK OF 
DRL/IRF AND FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S PERSONAL INTERVENTIONS ON 
THIS ISSUE IN BEIJING.

THE POLICIES OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 
AND PARTICIPATES INTENSELY IN THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE TO 
PROMOTE ITS OWN AGENDA, PARTICULARLY ITS POSITION ON 
SEXUALITY AND THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY.  THE HOLY SEE WILL BE 
A U.S. ALLY ON ISSUES THAT DEFEND \"HUMAN DIGNITY,\" SUCH AS 
TRAFFICKING, PEACEKEEPING, DEVELOPMENT AID, AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS.  IT COULD BE A POWERFUL OPPONENT ON OTHERS SUCH AS 
MILITARY INTERVENTION, SANCTIONS, THE DEATH PENALTY, AND 
ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.  U.S. MISSIONS TO

WHERE VIEWS MAY DIVERGE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
THE HOLY SEE\'S MULTILATERAL FOREIGN POLICY 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) THE HOLY SEE IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN A BROAD 
RANGE OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS -- TYPICALLY AS AN 
\"OBSERVER\" -- AND WORKS WITHIN THESE FORA TO ADVANCE 
PRINCIPLES CENTRAL TO THE CHURCH\'S WORLD VIEW:  PRIORITY OF 
THE HUMAN PERSON; THE PROMOTION AND, WHEN NECESSARY, THE 
DEFENSE OF PEACE; SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY BUILDING 
INITIATIVES; AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL ORDER 
BASED ON JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  FM TAURAN RECENTLY 
RESTATED THE HOLY SEE\'S BASIC MESSAGE TO UN MEMBER STATES: 
ALL NATIONS ARE EQUAL, WITH EQUAL DIGNITY AND RIGHT TO 
DEFENSE OF IDENTITY AND AUTONOMY; NATIONS MUST ACT IN 
SOLIDARITY (I.E., ACCORDING TO RECIPROCAL MORAL OBLIGATIONS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03633  01 OF 03  231457Z 
NOT ONLY TO TREAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT BUT TO SEE THAT 
PEOPLES\' BASIC NEEDS ARE MET).  THE HOLY SEE REGARDS THE 
UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM AS AN IDEAL FORUM AND PRIVILEGED 
PLATFORM TO ADVANCE THESE PRINCIPLES MULTILATERALLY.  AS A 
RESULT, IT HAS TENDED TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN FACED WITH 
THE UN\'S FAILINGS, PARTICULARLY ITS BUREAUCRATIC 
DEFICIENCIES.  IT IS UNLIKELY TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT U.S. 
CRITIQUES OF THE UN.  HOWEVER, THE HOLY SEE WILL NOT 
HESITATE TO CRITICIZE THE UN AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
DIRECTLY WHEN THESE ENGAGE IN A PERCEIVED ASSAULT ON THE 
HOLY SEE\'S CORE PRINCIPLES. 
 
3. (U)  IN OPTING FOR PERMANENT OBSERVER STATUS RATHER THAN 
FULL MEMBERSHIP IN MOST ORGANIZATIONS, THE HOLY SEE HAS 
SOUGHT TO EMPHASIZE ITS MORAL, RATHER THAN POLITICAL, 
AUTHORITY, AND ITS UNIQUE INTERNATIONAL JURIDICAL STATUS. 
THE HOLY SEE THEREFORE OPERATES FROM A DOCTRINAL AND 
PRINCIPLE-BASED PERSPECTIVE WITHIN INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN ITS REPUTATION OF BEING \"SUPER 
PARTES\" - A DISINTERESTED MORAL AGENT ACTING FOR THE GOOD OF 
HUMANITY.  THE HOLY SEE IS RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE IN PURELY 
\"POLITICAL\" MATTERS, SUCH AS THE UNSC VOTE ON SUDAN\'S 
MEMBERSHIP, EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF ESCHEWING ITS VOTE ON SUCH 
MATTERS IN FORA WHERE IT HAS A VOTE.  THE HOLY SEE PREFERS 
NOT TO ENGAGE ON OPERATIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS CANDIDACIES FOR 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, PREFERRING TO BE IN THE 
ORGANIZATION BUT NOT OF IT.  IN THE SUDAN CASE, IT DID TAKE 
AN ACTIVE BUT BEHIND THE SCENES ROLE IN DISCUSSING WITH 
OTHER UNSC DELEGATES THE INAPPROPRIATENESS OF SUDAN AS A 
UNSC MEMBER.

4. (SBU) SOME WITHIN THE CHURCH HIERARCHY HAVE QUESTIONED 
WHETHER THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY FULL VOTING 
MEMBERSHIP IN MORE ORGANIZATIONS, BUT AS BISHOP MARCHETTO OF 
THE COUNCIL FOR THE PASTORAL CARE OF MIGRANTS AND TRAVELERS 
RECENTLY POINTED OUT TO US, OBSRVER STATUS GIVES THE HOLY 
SEE THE BEST OF BOTH ORLDS:  IT CAN PARTICIPATE IN 
DISCUSSIONS AS ACTVELY AS ANY MEMBER, BUT RETAINS THE 
ABILITY TO SAY ABOVE THE FRAY AND \"SAY THINGS THAT NEED TO 
BESAID.\" 
 
5.  (U)  THE HOLY SEE\'S PRINCIPLES TRANSATE INTO A SERIES 
OF STRONGLY HELD POSITIONS ON SSUES OF PRIORITY INTEREST TO 
THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THAT 
WAR MUST ALWAYS BE REFUTED AND PRIORITY GIVEN TO NEGOTIATION 
AND THE USE OF JURIDICAL MEANS FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION.  IT 
WILL THEREFORE OPPOSE THE USE OF FORCE UNLESS THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF ITS JUST WAR DOCTRINE ARE FULFILLED, AS WAS 
THE CASE IN THE LIBERATION OF KUWAIT, BUT NOT IN THE 
CONTINUED MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ (REFTEL).  THE HOLY 
SEE ALSO USES MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY TO PROTECT HUMAN LIFE 
FROM CONCEPTION TO NATURAL DEATH, AS WELL AS TO PROMOTE ITS

6.  (U) IN MANY CASES, U.S. AND VATICAN VIEWS ARE 
COMPATIBLE, AND HOLY SEE DIPLOMATS CAN BE VALUABLE ALLIES. 
WHERE THE USG SEEKS TO PROMOTE HUMAN VALUES AND RELIEVE 
HUMAN SUFFERING BY MEDIATING CONFLICTS, COMBATING DISEASE, 
AND PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, THE HOLY SEE WILL BE A STRONG 
PARTNER.   THE HOLY SEE PERCEIVES A CLOSER THAN EVER 
CONVERGENCE WITH THE USG IN SEVERAL AREAS.  THE MOST 
UNAMBIGUOUS EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE RECENT COORDINATION OF 
POSITIONS IN SUPPORT OF A UN CONVENTION TO BAN ALL FORMS OF 
HUMAN CLONING, AN EFFORT THAT WAS EXTREMELY WELL-RECEIVED AT 
THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN THE CURIA.  POST IS ALSO ENGAGED WITH 
RELEVANT CURIA OFFICES IN A DIALOGUE TO EXPLORE QUESTIONS OF 
FOOD SECURITY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND THE POSITIVE 
CONTRIBUTION TO BE MADE BY GMOS.  WHILE THE HOLY SEE HAS YET 
TO BE CONVINCED THAT USG COMMERCIAL INTERESTS ARE NOT THE 
DRIVING MOTIVATION FOR OUR SUPPORT FOR GMO\'S, THEY ARE 
WILLING TO DISCUSS GMOS WITH AN OPEN MIND AS A MEANS OF 
INCREASING FOOD SECURITY.  IF WE CAN MAKE OUR CASE, THE HOLY 
SEE COULD BECOME A POWERFUL BOOSTER IN THE FAO AND THE 
COUNCIL OF EUROPE TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR GMO\'S AS A MEANS TO 
ALLEVIATE HUNGER.  IF, HOWEVER, THE HOLY SEE WERE TO 
CONCLUDE THAT GMOS ARE IMMORAL, IT COULD COMPLICATE OUR 
EFFORTS TO PROMOTE U.S. AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS AND 
CONTRIBUTE TO THE ALLEVIATION OF HUNGER THROUGH GMO\'S.

WITHIN THE NGO\'S HOME COUNTRIES.  AT THE CAIRO CONFERENCE, 
AS WELL AS IN BEIJING IN 1995, THE HOLY SEE FORMED EFFECTIVE 
ALLIANCES WITH CONSERVATIVE SOUTH AMERICAN AND ISLAMIC 
STATES SUCH AS GUATEMALA AND LIBYA IN SUPPORT OF ITS 
POSITION.  THE STRATEGY WAS SUCCESSFUL AND WE EXPECT IT TO 
BE USED AGAIN.  ACCORDING TO FM TAURAN, THE HOLY SEE\'S BASIC 
POSITION IS THAT A FAMILY IS CONSTITUTED OF A MAN AND A 
WOMAN IN A PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT HUMAN NATURE AND 
UNIVERSAL RIGHTS EXIST AND ARE SANCTIONED IN THE \"GREAT 
DOCUMENTS AND CONVENTIONS THAT REGULATE THE LIFE OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.\"  TAURAN SAID THE HOLY SEE WOULD 
CONTINUE TO PROMOTE A CONSERVATIVE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN MORALITY 
OF SEXUAL ABSTINENCE OUTSIDE OF LEGAL MARRIAGE, FIDELITY 
WITHIN MARRIAGE, AND OPPOSITION TO ARTIFICIAL FORMS OF 
CONTRACEPTION, ABORTION AND THE DEATH PENALTY.  OBVIOUSLY, 
THIS APPROACH LEADS THE HOLY SEE TO BALKS AT WIDELY 
SANCTIONED APPROACHES ON SOME ISSUES SUCH AS CONDOM USE TO 
PREVENT HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA, PREFERRING TO FOCUS ON 
EDUCATION, ABSTINENCE, AND TREATMENT.  THE HOLY SEE HAS ALSO 
LOBBIED AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INITIATIVES SUCH AS 
ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION AND ABORTION FOR WOMEN IN REFUGEE 
CAMPS DURING RECENT CONFLICTS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE 
VIGOROUSLY TO PROMOTE ITS VIEWS ON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES.

AGGRESSIVE IN FOSTERING SUCH ALLIANCES, AS WHEN IT SOLICITED 
THE SUPPORT OF MOSLEM STATES DURING RECENT UN CONFERENCES. 
THE HOLY SEE ALSO ENCOURAGES SYMPATHETIC NGOS ACCREDITED TO 
THE UN TO LOBBY INDIVIDUAL STATES ON SO-CALLED MORAL ISSUES. 
VATICAN OFFICIALS ARE VERY OPEN TO DISCUSSION WITH U.S.

SUBJECT: POPE CONDEMNS DESECRATION OF JEWISH CEMETARY AND 
ANTI-SEMITISM 
 
 
1. (U)  POPE JOHN PAUL II CONDEMNED GROWING ANTI-SEMITISM IN 
EUROPE AFTER THIRTY-FIVE JEWISH GRAVES IN A ROME CEMETERY 
WERE DESECRATED JULY 18.  IN A TELEGRAM TO ROME\'S CHIEF 
RABBI JULY 19 PUBLISHED ON THE VATICAN\'S WEBSITE, THE POPE 
DESCRIBED THE DESECRATION AS A \"DETESTABLE ACT THAT FOLLOWS 
OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS OF A SERIOUS NATURE THAT HAVE TAKEN 
PLACE WITH ALARMING FREQUENCY IN EUROPE AND ON OTHER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  03634  231459Z 
CONTINENTS.\"  THE POPE \"STRONGLY CONDEMNED SIMILAR IGNOBLE 
ACTS AND ANTI-SEMITIC SENTIMENTS THAT INSPIRE SUCH ACTS, AND 
OFFERED HIS SYMPATHY TO THE FAMILIES AFFECTED BY THE ACTS. 
 
2. (SBU)  COMMENT: THE POPE REGULARLY SENDS MESSAGES TO 
COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LEADERS IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR 
CALAMITIES.  HIS TELEGRAM TO ROME\'S JEWISH COMMUNITY IS THE 
ONLY ONE IN RECENT MEMORY TO CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACKS, 
AND SUGGESTS A GROWING CONCERN ON THE PART OF THE VATICAN 
FOR THE RISE OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE.  A JOURNALIST 
CONTACT TOLD US THAT OVER DINNER THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, THE 
ISRAELI DCM HAD MENTIONED HE WAS NOT EXPECTING VATICAN 
COMMENTARY ON THE DESECRATION.  EMBASSY HAS RECENTLY 
ENCOURAGED CURIA OFFICIALS TO USE THE HOLY SEE\'S MORAL VOICE 
TO COUNTER RESURGENT ANTI-SEMITISM AND OTHER FORMS OF RACISM 
AND XENOPHOBIA IN EUROPE.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: THE LIMITS OF VATICAN PERSUASION ON BISHOPS\' 
POLITICAL VIEWS 
 
REF: 2001 VATICAN 0196 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: DESPITE THE PERCEPTION OF THE HOLY SEE AS 
A HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION, IT RARELY GIVES \"MARCHING 
ORDERS\" TO CATHOLIC BISHOPS ON SECULAR POLITICAL MATTERS. 
IN THE RARE CASES WHEN IT DOES DECIDE TO PRESS ITS POLITICAL 
VIEWS, IT IS LARGELY LIMITED TO THE POWER OF PAPAL 
PERSUASION - WHICH IS COMPELLING, BUT NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  03636  01 OF 02  231501Z 
CHANGE BISHOPS\' INDIVIDUAL CONVICTIONS.  THE POPE\'S VIEWS ON 
POLITICAL MATTERS ARE CONVEYED BY THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE 
THROUGH THE LOCAL NUNCIO.  HOWEVER, THE HOLY SEE GENERALLY 
SEEKS TO AVOID PUBLIC DISPUTES, BOTH TO PRESERVE THE UNITY 
OF THE CHURCH AND TO PROTECT THE PHYSICAL SECURITY OF ITS 
ADHERENTS IN COUNTRIES WHERE CATHOLICS ARE A THREATENED 
MINORITY.  WHEN LOCAL BISHOPS\' VIEWS RUN COUNTER TO U.S. 
INTERESTS, DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE RESIDENT NUNCIO AND THE 
BISHOPS THEMSELVES OFFER THE BEST MEANS TO ADDRESS ISSUES. 
EMBASSY VATICAN WOULD ALSO BE PREPARED TO RAISE ISSUES OF 
PRIORITY INTEREST WITH THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE.  END 
SUMMARY.

BISHOPS AND POLITICS 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) EMBASSY VATICAN OCCASIONALLY RECEIVES QUERIES FROM 
POSTS AS TO WHETHER THE HOLY SEE MIGHT INTERVENE TO CHANGE 
THE POLITICAL BEHAVIOR OF A BISHOP.  RECENT INQUIRIES, FOR 
EXAMPLE, HAVE FOCUSED ON HARD LINE CROAT-NATIONALIST CLERGY 
IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AND BISHOPS\' LETTERS 
SEEMING TO SUPPORT BASQUE SEPARATISM.  IN THE PAST, BISHOPS\' 
SUPPORT FOR LIBERATION THEOLOGY IN CENTRAL AMERICA OR 
REPRESSIVE REGIMES IN THE SOUTHERN CONE OF LATIN AMERICA 
HAVE EVOKED CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND CRITICISM. 
UNLIKE OTHER GOVERNMENTS WE MIGHT APPROACH TO REIN IN AN 
OFFICIAL, THE HOLY SEE IS CONSTRAINED ON POLITICAL ISSUES 
(UNLIKE ISSUES OF CHURCH DOCTRINE) BY CHURCH STRUCTURES AND 
TRADITIONS FROM COMPELLING ADHERENCE TO VIEWS FAVORED BY THE 
CURIA.

THE LIMITS TO PAPAL PERSUASION 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) THE HOLY SEE HAS LIMITED OPTIONS FOR INFLUENCING 
LOCAL BISHOPS\' POLITICAL VIEWS.  USUALLY IT RELIES ON THE 
POWER OF PERSUASION VIA THE LOCAL NUNCIO.  A BISHOP IS 
BROADLY AUTONOMOUS IN HIS DIOCESE, HOWEVER, AS THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH FOLLOWS THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY -- THE 
REQUIREMENT THAT LOCAL ELEMENTS OF THE CHURCH MANAGE THEIR 
OWN AFFAIRS.  THE HOLY SEE MAY INVOKE THE FEALTY OF A BISHOP 
TO HIS POPE, BUT IT HAS LIMITED DISCIPLINARY RECOURSE IN THE 
EVENT THE BISHOP REFUSES TO ALTER OR TONE DOWN HIS VIEWS. 
WERE THE POPE TO ATTEMPT TO REPLACE OR RECALL THE BISHOP ON 
THE BASIS OF POLITICAL VIEWS AGAINST THE WILL OF HIS FLOCK, 
HE WOULD RISK PROVOKING A SCHISM, WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT THE 
POPE\'S VIEWS WOULD PREVAIL.  THE VATICAN SEEKS TO AVOID SUCH 
AN INJURY TO THE \"FAMILY\" OF THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH AT ALMOST 
ANY COST. 
 
4. (SBU) IN RECENT HISTORY, THE POPE HAS EXCOMMUNICATED A 
BISHOP ONLY FOR DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCES, NOT POLITICAL ONES. 
FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1988 ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE FRENCH PRELATE, 
MARCEL LEFEBVRE WAS EXCOMMUNICATED \"AUTOMATICALLY\" FOR 
ORDAINING NEW BISHOPS FOR HIS BREAK-AWAY GROUP OF CATHOLICS 
WITHOUT THE REQUIRED PERMISSION OF THE POPE.  ANOTHER 
EXAMPLE OF CHURCH DISCIPLINE WAS THE BREAKUP OF THE SAO 
PAOLO DIOCESE IN 1989 INTO FOUR SEPARATE DIOCESES.  THE POPE 
AND HIS CURIA UNILATERALLY DECLARED THE BREAKUP AND 
INSTALLATION OF THREE ADDITIONAL (AND MORE CONSERVATIVE)

BISHOPS WHEN ARCHBISHOP OF SAO PAOLO EVARISTO ARNS REFUSED 
TO BACK DOWN FROM HIS STRONG SUPPORT FOR LIBERATION 
THEOLOGY. 
 
5. (SBU)  MORE FREQUENTLY, THE VATICAN HAS HAD LIMITED 
ABILITY IN CHANGING POLITICAL POSITIONS OF ITS BISHOPS.  IN 
2001, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CROATIAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE\'S PUBLIC 
CRITICISM OF THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED AND REFORM-ORIENTED 
GOVERNMENT OF STIPE MESIC, PRESENTED A THREAT TO THE 
VATICAN\'S BROADER INTEREST IN REGIONAL RECONCILIATION AND 
STABILITY.  THE NUNCIO IN ZAGREB WAS CHARGED WITH CONVEYING 
THE HOLY SEE\'S \"CEASE AND DESIST\" ORDER TO THE CROATIAN 
BISHOPS.  WHEN THAT DIDN\'T CHANGE THE LATTER\'S ANTI- 
GOVERNMENT COMMENTARY, THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE DISPATCHED 
FM EQUIVALENT ARCHBISHOP TAURAN TO ZAGREB TO PRESS THE 
POINT.  TAURAN LEFT A PRO MEMORIA WITH THE CROATIAN BISHOPS 
-- AN ESPECIALLY STRONG INDICATION OF THE HOLY SEE\'S 
INTEREST IN THE ISSUE (REFTEL). THE POPE, HOWEVER, DID NOT 
PUBLICLY CENSURE THE LOCAL BISHOPS.  THAT HE DIDN\'T 
UNDERSCORES THE PRIMARY INTEREST IN PROTECTING THE OUTWARD

ZELLWEGER SAYS IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE 
CROSSING THE BORDER TO ACCESS FOOD AND MEDICINES WITH THE

2.  (C)  DURING A JULY 21 COURTESY CALL, SECRETARY OF THE 
PONTIFICAL CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF THE PEOPLES 
ARCHBISHOP ROBERT SARAH OFFERED HIS VIEWS ON A WIDE RANGE OF 
ISSUES FACING THE CHURCH IN AFRICA.  SARAH, FROM GUINEA, TOLD 
US HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A BISHOPS\' CONFERENCE MEETING IN 
ADDIS ABABA, WHERE THE BISHOPS HAD EXPRESSED STRONG CONCERN 
AT THE CONTINUED PROBLEMS OF CONFLICT AND UNDER-DEVELOPMENT 
IN EAST AFRICA AND SUDAN.  SARAH REPORTED THE SUDANESE 
BISHOPS CHARACTERIZED THE SUDAN SITUATION AS GRIM, WITH 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS CONTINUING TO DE-HUMANIZE CHRISTIANS 
AND OTHER NON-MUSLIM PEOPLES AS \"DOGS, GOOD ONLY TO BE 
BURNED.\"  HE SAID THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT IS BITTERLY 
ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANS, AND HE DID NOT SEE ANY HOPE FOR 
AN END TO THEIR HOSTILITY.  AS A RESULT, HE DIDN\'T SEE ANY 
OTHER SOLUTION THAN SEPARATION OF SUDAN INTO TWO COUNTRIES 
(NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL VATICAN POSITION, WHICH 
SUPPORTS DIALOGUE AND RECONCILIATION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH 
SUDAN.  FURTHERMORE, OUR CONVERSATION OCCURRED AFTER THE 
AGREEMENT ON THE MACHAKOS PROTOCOL, YET SARAH DID NOT 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT PRESENTED A REAL SOLUTION END NOTE.)

                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03638  01 OF 02  231756Z 
PAST MONTHS, SARAH SEE A GROWING CHALLENGE TO THE CHURCH IN 
AFRICA FROM ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS.  STARTING IN SUDAN, 
YOUNGER, GULF-EDUCATED ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN SPREADING 
MONEY THROUGHOUT SAHELIAN, EAST AND WEST AFRICA IN RECENT 
YEARS.  THEIR MESSAGE IS THAT CHRISTIANITY IS A FOREIGN, 
HIERARCHICAL, RELIGION AND THAT ISLAM IS AN INDIGENOUS 
RELIGION MORE IN TUNE WITH AFRICAN TRADITIONS. SARAH SAID THE 
CHURCH DOESN\'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO COMPETE WITH 
THESE GULF-FINANCED FUNDAMENTALISTS IN PROVIDING CASH AND 
SOCIAL SERVICES.  THE CHURCH\'S ONLY HOPE TO COUNTER THESE 
INFLUENCES WAS THROUGH EDUCATION.  THE ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISTS HAVE MADE THEIR GREATEST GAINS AMONG THE 
UNEDUCATED, BUT THE CHURCH\'S SCHOOLS, -- THOUGH UNDER-FUNDED 
--  WOULD TRY TO HELP PEOPLE DISCERN THE DANGERS INHERENT IN 
THE FUNDAMENTALIST PATH.  (COMMENT: IN PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS 
WITH SARAH, HE, LIKE OUR OTHER INTERLOCUTORS OF AFRICAN 
ORIGIN, HAD BEEN MUCH LESS CONCERNED WITH THE ISLAMIC 
CHALLENGE.  HE AND THEY HAD FOCUSED ON BASIC PROBLEMS OF 
DEVELOPMENT AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION.  HE NOW SEEMS TO SHARE 
THE SAME CONCERNS AS HIS EUROPEAN CURIAL COLLEAGUES, WHO HAVE 
BEEN AVIDLY RE-READING HUNTINGTON\'S CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS 
SINCE 09/11.  END COMMENT.) 
 
4. (C)  SARAH WAS QUICK TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE CHURCH\'S 
CENTURIES LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH AFRICA\'S \"INTEGRATED\" 
ISLAMIC COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN POSITIVE.  HE NOTED THE 
BASICALLY GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES IN 
MAJORITY-MUSLIM COUNTRIES SUCH AS SENEGAL AND CHAD. YET, EVEN 
THERE HE FEARED FOR A FUTURE IN WHICH WAHABBI-IST ARAB 
PROSELYTIZING COULD LEAD TO VIOLENT INTER-COMMUNAL CONFLICT.

5. (SBU)  RESPONDING TO A QUERY ABOUT HIS PREVIOUS FOCUS ON 
RWANDAN EXCESSES IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 
(DRC), SARAH TOLD US HE HAD MET WITH RWANDAN PRESIDENT KAGAME 
IN KIGALI IN LATE MAY.  THE ASSOCIATION OF BISHOPS\' 
CONFERENCES IN CENTRAL AFRICA (ACEAC IN ITS FRENCH ACRONYM) 
ORGANIZED A SERIES OF MEETINGS CULMINATING IN A PLENARY WITH 
KAGAME IN LATE MAY.  THE ACEAC HAD DECIDED TO CONDUCT A 
SERIES OF PUBLIC MEETINGS FOR THE  FIRST TIME IN YEARS IN THE 
THREE COUNTRIES OF THE ASSOCIATION, TO DEMONSTRATE TO 
CITIZENS OF THE GREAT LAKES CONFLICT ZONE THE POSSIBILITY OF 
RECONCILIATION.  THEY DISCUSSED WITH KAGAME THE NEED FOR 
ACTIVE CONFLICT RESOLUTION SO THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE 
TO FACE THEIR MAJOR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES.  SARAH 
REPORTED THAT KAGAME TOLD THE BISHOPS HE WAS READY TO 
CONSIDER POSITIVELY THEIR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO PROCEED.  THE 
BISHOPS ARE DRAFTING A DOCUMENT FOR KAGAME THAT SHOULD BE 
READY BEFORE SEPTEMBER.

WORLD MUST ALSO LOOK TO ITS OWN RESPONSIBILITIES.  ON 
CORRUPTION,  FOR EXAMPLE, HE SAID AFRICAN OFFICIALS ARE 
WORKING IN A \"ZONA SPORCA\" OR FILTHY ENVIRONMENT.  THEY 
WOULDN\'T HAVE CORRUPT MONEY IF EQUALLY CORRUPT BUSINESSMEN 
WEREN\'T GIVING IT TO THEM.  HE WAS ENCOURAGED TO HEAR OF U.S. 
LAWS CONSTRAINING U.S. FIRMS FROM OFFERING BRIBES, AND AGREED 
ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT THE WESTERN NATIONS 
DEVELOPED SIMILAR PRACTICES.  THE CHURCH\'S OFFICIAL 
PUBLICATIONS ON DEVELOPMENT CONDEMN CORRUPTION AND INSIST ON 
REFORMS PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE IN RECIPIENT COUNTRIES. 
BUT, ACCORDING TO THE DOCTRINE OF \"SOCIAL GOODS,\" SARAH SAID 
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ALSO HAVE A DUTY TO LIVE IN SOLIDARITY 
WITH THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  THIS MEANS HELPING THEM WITH 
RELIEF ASSISTANCE AS NEEDED, HELPING THEM TO BUILD CAPACITY, 
AND OFFERING THEM ACCESS TO DEVELOPED MARKETS AND FINANCE. 
HE REGARDED SUPPORT FROM DEVELOPED COUNTRIES FOR INCREASED 
EDUCATION AND TREATMENT AS ESSENTIAL TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS.  BUT 
THE MOST URGENT TASK WAS, SARAH INSISTED, TO END THE 
CONFLICTS CURRENTLY PLAGUING AFRICA, WITHOUT WHICH LITTLE 
PROGRESS WOULD BE POSSIBLE. THE UNITED STATES \"HAS A SPECIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY, AS THE GREATEST POWER ON EARTH, TO STEP UP TO 
THESE CHALLENGES AND LEAD THE DEVELOPED WORLD TO GREATER 
SOLIDARITY WITH THE LESS FORTUNATE,\" HE CONCLUDED.

WORLD IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN CHRISTIAN. 
 IT ENJOYS STRONG FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM DIOCESES IN THE 
DEVELOPED WORLD, AND THUS IS ONE OF THE \"RICHEST\" DICASTRIES. 
 IN PAST CONVERSATIONS OUR INTERLOCUTORS HAVE FOCUSED WITH 
EVIDENT PRIDE ON THE LARGE SOCIAL SERVICE PRESENCE OF THE 
CHURCH IN AFRICA.  MORE THAN ONE HAS SAID THE CHURCH PROVIDES 
MORE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (INCLUDING SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS) 
IN AFRICA THAN DOES THE EUROPEAN UNION.  THE CURRENT 
PRIORITIES LAID OUT BY SARAH -- CONFRONTING ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM, PROMOTION REGIONAL RECONCILIATION, AND 
ENCOURAGING GOVERNMENTAL REFORM AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT -- ALL 
TRACK CLOSELY WITH U.S. OBJECTIVES IN AFRICA.  THEY SUGGEST 
THAT WE CAN SECURE IMPORTANT SUPPORT FOR U.S. POLICIES IN 
THESE AREAS FROM THE HOLY SEE.

 1. (C)  SUMMARY:  SECRETARY OF THE CONGREGATION FOR EASTERN 
CHURCHES, ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO VEGLIO, TOLD CHARGE THAT THE 
EASTERN CHURCHES -- THE 22 CHRISTIAN RITES THAT ARE NOT ROMAN 
CATHOLIC BUT ARE IN COMMUNION WITH ROME -- FACE A NUMBER OF 
CHALLENGES THAT CAST LONG SHADOWS OVER THEIR FUTURE.  BOTH

RADICAL ISLAM AND RUSSIAN ORTHODOXY PRESENT OBSTACLES TO THE 
VITALITY AND SURVIVAL OF THE DISPARATE EASTERN RITE CATHOLIC 
COMMUNITIES IN EURASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND SOUTH 
ASIA, BUT, BUT IN BOTH CASES, ACCORDING TO VEGLIO, THE LACK 
OF SEPARATION BETWEEN FAITH AND STATE IS THE CHIEF HURDLE. 
WHILE CHRISTIANS ARE LEAVING THE MIDDLE EAST IN GREAT 
NUMBERS, HOLLOWING OUT MILLENNIA-OLD CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES, 
THE GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH IN UKRAINE AND THE INDIAN EASTERN 
CATHOLIC CHURCHES CENTERED ON THE STATE OF KERALA ARE THE 
MOST \"LIVELY\" AND GROWING.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO VEGLIO, SECRETARY OF THE 
CONGREGATION FOR EASTERN CHURCHES TOLD CHARGE DURING A JULY 
24 MEETING THAT THE EASTERN CHURCHES IN RUSSIA AND ARAB 
COUNTRIES ARE COMING UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE, AND HAVE \"A 
BIG QUESTION MARK\" OVER THEIR FUTURE.  WHERE \"NATIONAL\" 
FAITHS ARE CLOSE TO OR INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM POLITICAL 
POWER, VEGLIO OBSERVED, THE CATHOLIC FAITHFUL FACE PERSISTENT 
DISCRIMINATION AND THE CHURCH FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO CONDUCT 
ITS PASTORAL DUTIES.  VEGLIO SAID THERE ARE 22 CHRISTIAN 
RITES THAT, WHILE NOT ROMAN CATHOLIC, NEVERTHELESS REMAIN IN 
COMMUNION WITH ROME (I.E. RECOGNIZE THE ROMAN POPE AS LEADER 
OF THE FAITHFUL).  THESE RITES ARE DIVIDED INTO FOUR 
PRINCIPAL GEOGRAPHICAL GROUPS IN: 
 
-- THE FORMERLY COMMUNIST EUROPE 
-- THE MIDDLE EAST 
-- INDIA, AND 
-- ETHIOPIA/ERITREA.

THE ORTHODOX CHALLENGE 
---------------------- 
 
3.  (C) VEGLIO, A FORMER IV GRANTEE RETURNING TO ROME AFTER 
NEARLY 30 YEARS OF OVERSEAS HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC WORK, SAID 
HIS CONGREGATION\'S PRIMARY DUTY WAS TO ENSURE THAT THESE 
CHURCHES ARE ABLE TO CARRY OUT PASTORAL CARE OF THE FAITHFUL 
WHEREVER THEY ARE (E.G. EVEN AMONG GREEK CATHOLICS IN THE 
U.S.).  REPRISING THE DIFFICULTIES CATHOLICS FACE WITH THE 
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, VEGLIO SUGGESTED THAT RUSSIAN 
ORTHODOX OBJECTIONS TO THE PRESENCE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN 
RUSSIA DERIVES FROM THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CLERGY\'S \"OLD 
FASHIONED WORLD VIEW, SIMILAR TO THE VATICAN\'S WAY OF 
THINKING SIXTY YEARS AGO.\"   HE BELIEVED THAT THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH MAY BE MORE APPEALING TO THE AVERAGE RUSSIAN OR 
UKRAINIAN BECAUSE, DURING THE YEARS OF COMMUNIST REPRESSION, 
THEY SUFFERED AND RETAINED THEIR \"PURITY\" WHILE THE ORTHODOX 
CHURCH HAD TOO COZY A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNIST POWERS. 
 HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT AS THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX MODERNIZED AND 
BECAME LESS ISOLATED THEY WOULD FEEL LESS THREATENED AND 
WOULD DROP THEIR \"IRRATIONAL\" OBJECTIONS TO CATHOLICS IN 
RUSSIA.  IN THE MEANTIME THE VATICAN WOULD CONTINUE TO 
MINISTER TO THE FAITHFUL AS BEST IT COULD.  VEGLIO IMPLIED IT 
WOULD BE DECADES, NOT YEARS, BEFORE THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX 
WOULD COME AROUND TO THIS VIEW.

THE CHALLENGE FROM ISLAM

4.  (C)  TURNING TO THE MIDDLE EAST, VEGLIO OBSERVED THAT THE

PAGE 04        VATICA  03692  01 OF 02  261100Z 
MUSLIM COUNTRIES POSED AN EVEN GREATER CHALLENGE.  VEGLIO, 
WHO RECENTLY RETURNED TO THE HOLY SEE AFTER SERVING AS NUNCIO 
IN BEIRUT, ASSERTED THAT ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM, CENTERED ON 
SUDAN, THREATENED THE GOOD RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS HERETOFORE 
EXISTED BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 
(REF B).  HE WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT THE YOUNGER, 
MORE MODERN, SECULAR AND USUALLY CHRISTIAN PEOPLE IN THE ARAB 
MIDDLE EAST ARE GIVING UP ON THEIR COUNTRIES AND EMIGRATING. 
HE SAID THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DECIMATED BY THIS 
EMIGRATION, WHICH IS SOMETHING \"THE MUSLIMS WANT.\"  IN A 
REFRESHINGLY FRANK ADMISSION, VEGLIO SAID THAT, AS NUNCIO, HE 
HAD PRESSURED BEIRUT TO LEGALIZE CIVIL MARRIAGES (MUCH TO THE 
CHAGRIN OF HIS BISHOPS).  HE ARGUED THAT PEOPLE IN MIDDLE 
EASTERN STATES SHOULD HAVE THE \"MODERN\" OPTION OF BEING 
SECULAR, WHICH MAKES FOR A BETTER POLITY THAN DOES THEOCRACY. 
 HE SAID IN MANY ARAB STATES THE CONSTITUTION IS EFFECTIVELY 
THE KORAN.  \"GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NO MORE HAVE THE BIBLE THAN 
THE KORAN AS THEIR CONSTITUTION\" IF COUNTRIES IN THE REGION 
WERE TO MOVE TOWARD GENUINE DEMOCRATIC AND TOLERANT 
GOVERNMENTS, HE ASSERTED.

NOTED.  THE GREEK RITE CATHOLICS ARE SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERING 
PROPERTIES CONFISCATED BY STALIN AND GIVEN, IN MANY CASES, TO 
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX COMMUNITIES.  VEGLIO AVERRED THAT THE STRONG 
PRESENCE OF THIS CHURCH IN UKRAINE BEFORE WORLD WAR II, AND 
THE STRONG SUPPORT OF ITS FAITHFUL IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE 
IN THE WEST, HAVE GIVEN IT AN ADVANTAGE.  TWO MEASURES OF ITS 
CONFIDENCE ARE THE INTENT BY ARCHBISHOP MAJOR LUBOMYR TO MOVE 
HIS SEE FROM LVOV TO KIEV AND THE UKRAINIAN CHURCH\'S PRESSURE 
ON THE HOLY SEE TO RAISE ITS STATUS TO THAT OF A FULL 
PATRIARCHATE. (NOTE: THIS WOULD PUT IT ON A PAR WITH THE 
RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN PATRIARCHATES OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN 
KIEV). 
 
6.  (C)  THE SYRO-MALABAR AND SYRO-MALANKARA CHURCHES ARE 
REPUTED TO HAVE A 2,000-YEAR PRESENCE IN SOUTHERN INDIA, 
ORIGINATING, ACCORDING TO VEGLIO, FROM THE VISIT OF SAINT 
THOMAS THE APOSTLE.  THESE CHURCHES ARE THRIVING EVEN AS 
CHRISTIANS SUFFER PERSECUTION IN HINDU-NATIONALIST PARTS OF 
INDIA.  VEGLIO PLANS A VISIT TO THOSE CHURCHES AND TO THE 
MIDDLE EAST IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

7.  (C) IN ADDITION TO ITS PASTORAL WORK, THE CONGREGATION

IT IS FUNDED BY THE HOLY SEE AND BY DONATIONS FROM WEALTHY 
CHURCHES IN EUROPE AND THE U.S.  ON THE SUBJECT OF THE MIDDLE

ALSO CAUSED PROBLEMS IN ISRAEL, WHICH HE NOTED WAS THE ONLY

CONGREGATION, AS ELSEWHERE IN THE HOLY SEE IS DEEPLY TROUBLED 
BY ISRAELI POLICIES VIS-A-VIS THE PALESTINIANS.  THE 
CONGREGATION WILL REMAIN ACTIVE IN SEEKING TO SUPPORT THE 
PALESTINIANS AS A MEANS OF PRESERVING THE REMNANTS OF THE 
CATHOLIC PRESENCE IN THE REGION.

SUBJECT: HOLY SEE SIGNS ACCORD WITH CZECH REPUBLIC 
 
1. (SBU)  THE HOLY SEE SIGNED A JURIDICAL ACCORD WITH THE 
CZECH REPUBLIC JULY 25 REGULATING THE STATUS OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH. THE AGREEMENT, REACHED AFTER THREE YEARS 
OF OCCASIONALLY DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS, GUARANTEES THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH FREEDOM TO CONDUCT ITS ACTIVITIES, IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  03717  291456Z 
PARTICULAR WORSHIP, GOVERNMENT OF ITS JURISDICTIONS, AND 
EDUCATION.  IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THE CIVIL EFFECTS OF A 
CHURCH MARRIAGE.  THE CZECH GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THE 
CHURCH THE RIGHT TO OFFER PASTORAL CARE IN HOSPITALS, 
SOCIAL CARE CENTERS AND PRISONS.  CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WILL 
HAVE THE SAME STATUS AS STATE INSTITUTIONS WITH 
COMMENSURATE RIGHTS AND DUTIES. THE AGREEMENT DID NOT 
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE RESTITUTION OF CHURCH PROPERTY 
EXPROPRIATED BY THE FORMERLY COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT BEYOND 
HORTATORY LANGUAGE COMMITTING TO A RESOLUTION AT THE 
EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE. 
 
2. (SBU) THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS ONE OF THE LAST EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES TO ENTER INTO SUCH A JURIDICAL AGREEMENT WITH 
THE HOLY SEE.  ACCORDING TO MONSIGNOR MICHAEL BANACH, 
DESK OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CZECH REPUBLIC, THE 
NEGOTIATIONS HAD BEEN DIFFICULT, AND THE HOLY SEE 
ULTIMATELY ACCEPTED LESS BINDING AND MORE NEUTRAL 
LANGUAGE THAN THEY HAD SOUGHT IN SOME AREAS IN ORDER TO 
ACHIEVE A TEXT ACCEPTABLE TO THE CABINET THAT WOULD HAVE 
A CHANCE OF SECURING PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL.  BECAUSE OF 
ANTI-CLERICAL SENTIMENTS THAT STILL PREVAIL IN THE CZECH 
REPUBLIC, THE HOLY SEE IS NOT CERTAIN HOW DIFFICULT 
PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL IS LIKELY TO BE. 
 
3. (SBU) BANACH SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS PARTICULARLY 
PLEASED WITH THE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF CATHOLIC 
MARRIAGES AND THE RECOGNITION OF CATHOLIC EDUCATION ON A 
PAR WITH THE STATE EDUCATION SYSTEM.  HE NOTED THAT THE 
CATHOLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THE CZECH REPUBLIC HAD REMAINED 
RELATIVELY STRONG, EVEN DURING THE COMMUNIST ERA.

PAGE 03        VATICA  03717  291456Z 
 
4. (U)  COMMENT:  THE HOLY SEE HAS CONCLUDED SIMILAR 
AGREEMENTS OR BROADER CONCORDATS WITH MOST COUNTRIES IN 
CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO 
STRENGTHEN THE JURIDICAL FOUNDATION OF ITS PRESENCE 
THROUGHOUT THE REGION.  POLAND, WITH A COMPLETE CONCORDAT 
IS THE FURTHEST ALONG, AND HUNGARY AND THE SLOVAK 
REPUBLIC WITH A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS ARE ALSO FAR 
ADVANCED.  THE CZECH REPUBLIC AGREEMENT HAD BEEN THE MOST 
DIFFICULT TO CONCLUDE WITHIN THE REGION.  THE HOLY SEE 
REGARDS AGREEMENTS WITH PREDOMINANTLY ORTHODOX ROMANIA AS 
UNLIKELY IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WHILE AGREEMENTS WITH 
BULGARIA ARE SEEN AS POSSIBLE BUT NOT IMMINENT.

1. SUMMARY: (C) VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTER ARCHBISHOP 
 
JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN TOLD CHARGE JULY 25 THAT THE HOLY SEE 
REMAINS SKEPTICAL OF PRIME MINISTER SHARON\'S WILLINGNESS TO 
ACCEPT A POLITICAL SOLUTION, AND VIEWS THE JULY 22 ISRAELI 
ACTION IN GAZA AS EVIDENCE OF SHARON\'S PREFERENCE FOR A 
MILITARY SOLUTION.  TAURAN WAS EVEN-HANDED, CONDEMNING 
PALESTINIAN ACTIONS, AND EXPRESSING DOUBT THAT EITHER SHARON 
OR ARAFAT WOULD BE ABLE TO SURMOUNT THEIR PREDILECTIONS AND 
TAKE THE STEPS NEEDED TO MOVE TOWARD A PEACE PROCESS.  FOR 
THAT REASON, THE VATICAN CONTINUES TO FAVOR THE CONVENING OF 
A PEACE CONFERENCE AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY.  THE HOLY SEE 
ALSO BELIEVES THAT SOME FORM OF INTERNATIONAL FORCE IS NEEDED 
TO SEPARATE THE TWO SIDES AND PROVIDE A BREATHING SPACE TO 
DAMPEN CURRENT HIGH EMOTIONS.  TAURAN REITERATED THE HOLY 
SEE\'S MOUNTING CONCERN FOR THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT\'S RECENT 
ACTIONS TO DENY VISAS TO ARCHBISHOP MAZUR AND TO RESTRICT 
VISAS FOR OTHER CATHOLIC PRIESTS.  ARCHBISHOP TRICARICO, WHO 
MOST CLOSELY TRACKS RUSSIAN ISSUES IN THE HOLY SEE, INDICATED 
THAT NOW IS THE TIME FOR UNEQUIVOCAL INDICATIONS OF U.S. 
SUPPORT FOR GREATER RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN RUSSIA.  END SUMMARY.

HOLY SEE\'S CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND RUSSIA 
DURING A JULY 25 COURTESY CALL.  ON THE MIDDLE EAST, TAURAN 
REGARDED ISRAEL\'S JULY 22 RAID ON GAZA AS FURTHER EVIDENCE 
FOR HIS CONVICTION THAT SHARON WAS NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN A 
POLITICAL SOLUTION.  TAURAN, WHO SERVED AS PAPAL NUNCIO IN 
LEBANON DURING ISRAEL\'S 1980\'S INCURSIONS, RECOUNTED A 
CONVERSATION SHARON HAD WITH LEBANESE CHRISTIANS AT THAT 
TIME.  SHARON HAD OBSERVED THAT CHRISTIANS AND JEWS LIVING IN 
A HOSTILE ARAB SEA COULD ONLY SURVIVE BY BEING IN A 
CONTINUOUS STATE OF WAR.  TAURAN WRYLY REMARKED THAT THIS HAD 
BEEN TRIED CENTURIES BEFORE DURING THE CRUSADES, BUT THE 
RESULTS DID NOT LEND MUCH SUPPORT SHARON\'S THESIS.  THE HOLY 
SEE SEES LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT SHARON HAS CHANGED HIS VIEWS, 
AND REMAINS SKEPTICAL THAT SHARON IS COMMITTED TO A POLITICAL 
SOLUTION.  \"SHARON PREFERS A MILITARY SOLUTION,\" TAURAN 
CONCLUDED, \"AND HAS YET TO REALIZE THAT THERE CAN BE NO 
SATISFACTORY MILITARY SOLUTION.\" 
 
3. (C) BECAUSE OF THE INTRANSIGENCE OF BOTH SHARON AND 
ARAFAT, THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THE PARTIES NEED THE IMPETUS OF 
AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO HELP THEM MOVE BEYOND THE 
CURRENT STALEMATE.  TAURAN ALSO BELIEVES THAT SOME FORM OF AN 
INTERNATIONAL FORCE IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE TIT-FOR-TAT 
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AND GIVE BOTH SIDES THE BREATHING SPACE 
THEY NEED TO DAMPEN EMOTIONS AND THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT A 
LASTING POLITICAL SOLUTION.  CHARGE OUTLINED TO TAURAN THE 
U.S. APPROACH, STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING THE 
SECURITY SITUATION AND THEN BEGINNING PARALLEL WORK ON 
PALESTINIAN REFORMS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PALESTINIAN 
CONDITIONS WHILE WORKING TOWARD THE PRESIDENT\'S VISION OF TWO 
STATES WITHIN THREE YEARS.  TAURAN, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED

SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN ON MIDDLE EAST AND RUSSIA: 
 SKEPTICAL OF SHARON; PERPLEXED BY MOSCOW 
 
THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS STILL NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM 
PUTIN, AND REMAINS MYSTIFIED AS TO WHY HE HAS YET TO RESPOND. 
 \"ALL WE WERE ASKING FOR WAS AN EXPLANATION OF WHY BISHOP 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

MAZUR WAS DENIED ENTRY INTO RUSSIA,\" TAURAN NOTED, \"NOTHING 
MORE.\"  TAURAN REITERATED HIS APPRECIATION FOR PRESIDENT 
BUSH\'S EARLIER WILLINGNESS TO RAISE THE POPE\'S CONCERNS ABOUT 
THIS CASE WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN, AND SUGGESTED THAT ADDITIONAL 
ENCOURAGEMENT MIGHT BE NEEDED. 
 
5.  (C) ARCHBISHOP TRICARICO, THE VATICAN\'S TOP RUSSIA EXPERT 
WAS MORE INSISTENT THAT OUTSIDE PRESSURE WOULD BE NECESSARY 
TO FOCUS THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  TRICARICO LAMENTED THAT RUSSIA\'S RECENT 
PRESSURE AGAINST THE CHURCH AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM MORE 
BROADLY APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SUBMERGED BY BROADER WESTERN 
PRIORITIES IN SEEKING RUSSIAN COOPERATION IN THE WAR ON 
TERRORISM.  HE BELIEVED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SITUATION WAS AT A 
CRITICAL JUNCTURE, AND THAT RUSSIA NEEDED TO HEAR A LOUD AND 
CONSISTENT MESSAGE FROM THE U.S. AND EUROPE THAT RUSSIA 
NEEDED TO RESPECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS IF IT WANTED TO 
INTEGRATE MORE CLOSELY WITH THE WEST. 
 
6.  (C) TRICARICO EXPRESSED PLEASURE WITH A RECENT PROVINCIAL 
COURT DECISION IN THE SIBERIAN CITY OF MAGADAN ALLOWING AN 
ALASKAN PRIEST TO REMAIN AS PASTOR OF A CATHOLIC PARISH IN 
THAT REMOTE CITY.  FATHER MICHAEL SHIELDS, PASTOR NATIVITY OF 
JESUS PARISH SINCE 1994, HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE 
PROVINCIAL MINISTRY OF JUSTICE ON THE GROUNDS THAT FOREIGNERS 
CANNOT BE PASTORS IN RUSSIA.  THE COURT TOOK ONLY 10 MINUTES 
TO DECIDE IN SHIELD\'S FAVOR.  THE CASE COULD HAVE A POSITIVE 
IMPACT BEYOND THE PROVINCE, TRICARICO SUGGESTED, BUT THAT IS 
FAR FROM CERTAIN.

OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW MIDDLE EAST EVENTS WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND SECRETARY POWELL DURING THEIR MAY VISIT TO THE VATICAN, 
AND REAFFIRMED HIS DESIRE TO STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE 
U.S. ON DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE QUARTET AIMED AT ADVANCING 
THE PRESIDENT\'S VISION FOR PEACE. 
 
8.  (C) (COMMENT CONTINUED) ON THE CHURCH IN RUSSIA, THE 
VATICAN\'S LEVEL OF CONCERN IS CLEARLY MOUNTING, AS THE ISSUE 
HAS COME UP IN A RANGE OF DISCUSSIONS WITH SENIOR CURIAL 
OFFICIALS.  THE HOLY SEE SEEMS AT A LOSS FOR HOW TO PROCEED 
-- GIVEN THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN APPEARS UNWILLING TO RESPOND TO 
THE POPE -- AND IS CLEARLY SIGNALING ITS INTEREST IN 
ADDITIONAL SIGNS OF U.S. SUPPORT FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN 
RUSSIA AND SPECIFICALLY FOR CLARIFICATION OF THE VISA 
SITUATION FOR PRIESTS.  WE WOULD WELCOME EMBASSY MOSCOW\'S 
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT IS BEHIND THE CURRENT STONEWALLING AND HOW 
BEST TO ENGAGE THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ON THIS ISSUE.

SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN ON MIDDLE EAST AND RUSSIA: 
 SKEPTICAL OF SHARON; PERPLEXED BY MOSCOW 
 
THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS STILL NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM 
PUTIN, AND REMAINS MYSTIFIED AS TO WHY HE HAS YET TO RESPOND. 
 \"ALL WE WERE ASKING FOR WAS AN EXPLANATION OF WHY BISHOP 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  03823  02 OF 02  021427Z 
MAZUR WAS DENIED ENTRY INTO RUSSIA,\" TAURAN NOTED, \"NOTHING 
MORE.\"  TAURAN REITERATED HIS APPRECIATION FOR PRESIDENT 
BUSH\'S EARLIER WILLINGNESS TO RAISE THE POPE\'S CONCERNS ABOUT 
THIS CASE WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN, AND SUGGESTED THAT ADDITIONAL 
ENCOURAGEMENT MIGHT BE NEEDED. 
 
5.  (C) ARCHBISHOP TRICARICO, THE VATICAN\'S TOP RUSSIA EXPERT 
WAS MORE INSISTENT THAT OUTSIDE PRESSURE WOULD BE NECESSARY 
TO FOCUS THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  TRICARICO LAMENTED THAT RUSSIA\'S RECENT 
PRESSURE AGAINST THE CHURCH AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM MORE 
BROADLY APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SUBMERGED BY BROADER WESTERN 
PRIORITIES IN SEEKING RUSSIAN COOPERATION IN THE WAR ON 
TERRORISM.  HE BELIEVED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SITUATION WAS AT A 
CRITICAL JUNCTURE, AND THAT RUSSIA NEEDED TO HEAR A LOUD AND 
CONSISTENT MESSAGE FROM THE U.S. AND EUROPE THAT RUSSIA 
NEEDED TO RESPECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS IF IT WANTED TO 
INTEGRATE MORE CLOSELY WITH THE WEST. 
 
6.  (C) TRICARICO EXPRESSED PLEASURE WITH A RECENT PROVINCIAL 
COURT DECISION IN THE SIBERIAN CITY OF MAGADAN ALLOWING AN 
ALASKAN PRIEST TO REMAIN AS PASTOR OF A CATHOLIC PARISH IN 
THAT REMOTE CITY.  FATHER MICHAEL SHIELDS, PASTOR NATIVITY OF 
JESUS PARISH SINCE 1994, HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE 
PROVINCIAL MINISTRY OF JUSTICE ON THE GROUNDS THAT FOREIGNERS 
CANNOT BE PASTORS IN RUSSIA.  THE COURT TOOK ONLY 10 MINUTES 
TO DECIDE IN SHIELD\'S FAVOR.  THE CASE COULD HAVE A POSITIVE 
IMPACT BEYOND THE PROVINCE, TRICARICO SUGGESTED, BUT THAT IS 
FAR FROM CERTAIN.

COMMENT

7.  (C) TAURAN REITERATED HIS APPRECIATION FOR THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW MIDDLE EAST EVENTS WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND SECRETARY POWELL DURING THEIR MAY VISIT TO THE VATICAN, 
AND REAFFIRMED HIS DESIRE TO STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE 
U.S. ON DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE QUARTET AIMED AT ADVANCING 
THE PRESIDENT\'S VISION FOR PEACE. 
 
8.  (C) (COMMENT CONTINUED) ON THE CHURCH IN RUSSIA, THE 
VATICAN\'S LEVEL OF CONCERN IS CLEARLY MOUNTING, AS THE ISSUE 
HAS COME UP IN A RANGE OF DISCUSSIONS WITH SENIOR CURIAL 
OFFICIALS.  THE HOLY SEE SEEMS AT A LOSS FOR HOW TO PROCEED 
-- GIVEN THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN APPEARS UNWILLING TO RESPOND TO 
THE POPE -- AND IS CLEARLY SIGNALING ITS INTEREST IN 
ADDITIONAL SIGNS OF U.S. SUPPORT FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN 
RUSSIA AND SPECIFICALLY FOR CLARIFICATION OF THE VISA 
SITUATION FOR PRIESTS.  WE WOULD WELCOME EMBASSY MOSCOW\'S 
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT IS BEHIND THE CURRENT STONEWALLING AND HOW 
BEST TO ENGAGE THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ON THIS ISSUE.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  HOLY SEE CHINA DESK OFFICER, MONSIGNOR 
GIANFRANCO ROTA-GRAZIOSI WELCOMED AMBASSADOR AT LARGE FOR 
INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM HANFORD\'S EFFORTS TO 
ENCOURAGE CHINA TO OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE, BUT 
EXPECTS LITTLE PROGRESS UNTIL AFTER THE LEADERSHIP PICTURE IS 
CLEARER FOLLOWING THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S CONFERENCE 
THIS FALL.  HE DESCRIBED THE CHINESE SUGGESTION THAT THE 
VATICAN\'S LACK OF CLARITY ON TAIWAN WAS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE 
TO PROGRESS AS A SMOKESCREEN FOR THE PRC\'S OWN INDECISION, 
SINCE THE VATICAN HAD REPEATEDLY MADE CLEAR ITS WILLINGNESS 
TO MOVE ITS EMBASSY TO BEIJING.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) DCM AND ACTING POLCHIEF MET AUGUST 12 WITH HOLY SEE 
CHINA DESK OFFICER ROTA-GRAZIOSI TO REVIEW THE OUTCOME OF 
AMBASSADOR HANFORD\'S AUGUST 5 VISIT TO CHINA (REFTELS) AND 
DISCUSS POTENTIAL AREAS OF PROGRESS IN THE RUN-UP TO THE 
PRESIDENT\'S OCTOBER MEETING WITH PRESIDENT JIANG.  DCM 
OBSERVED THAT AMBASSADOR HANFORD WAS SEEKING TO BUILD A 
DIALOGUE WITH OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
ISSUES AND TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE PROGRESS MAY BE 
POSSIBLE, INCLUDING RESUMPTION OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE 
VATICAN, CHANGES IN RELIGIOUS REGISTRATION LAWS, AND THE 
PROVISION OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION TO CHILDREN. 
 
3. (C) ON OPENING OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE VATICAN, DCM NOTED 
THE PRC OFFICIALS\' ASSERTION THAT THEY WANTED TO NORMALIZE 
RELATIONS WITH THE VATICAN, IF ONLY THE VATICAN COULD CLARIFY 
ITS RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAW THIS AS A 
DELAYING TACTIC TO MASK THE CHINESE OWN UNCERTAINTY OVER HOW 
TO PROCEED ON RELIGIOUS ISSUES, AN UNCERTAINTY COMPOUNDED BY 
THE UPCOMING COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE.  HE NOTED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  03962  130928Z 
THAT SECRETARY OF STATE SODANO HAS TWICE MADE EXPLICIT THE 
HOLY SEE\'S WILLINGNESS TO MOVE ITS EMBASSY TO BEIJING 
\"TONIGHT NOT TOMORROW\" IF THE PRC WAS PREPARED TO OPEN 
RELATIONS, SO THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT WHERE THE HOLY SEE STANDS 
ON TAIWAN.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THE VATICAN WAS PREPARED TO 
MAKE \"THE LEAP OF FAITH\" TO THE PRC\'S \"ONE-CHINA\" POLICY, 
EVEN WHILE HE LAMENTED THAT THIS DID NOT REALLY REFLECT 
TAIWAN\'S GLOBAL ROLE AND STATUS. 
 
4. (C) REACTING TO THE CONCERN RAISED TO AMBASSADOR HANFORD 
ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE POPE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE OCTOBER 2000 
CANONIZATION OF CHINESE MARTYRS,  MONSIGNOR ROTA-GRAZIOSI 
SAID THE POPE \"WOULD NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR THE CANONIZATION.\" 
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE NOTED THAT THE POPE HAD ALREADY 
APOLOGIZED FOR THE CHURCH\'S \"MISTAKES\" IN THE PAST.  HE 
LAMENTED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS YET TO HEAR ANY FORMAL 
RECOGNITION OF OR RESPONSE TO THIS OCTOBER 2001 APOLOGY. 
 
5.  (C) ROTA-GRAZIOSI EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR USG EFFORTS 
TO FOSTER A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND CHINA AND FOR 
OUR EFFORT TO PRESS FOR SHORTER AND MEDIUM-TERM CHANGES IN 
RESTRICTIVE CHINESE POLICIES.  HE WAS SKEPTICAL, HOWEVER, 
THAT CHINA WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD, ADDING THAT IT WILL 
\"TAKE YEARS, IF NOT DECADES\" FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO 
TRULY BE PREPARED TO EMBRACE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  HE EXPECTS 
THE PRC WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT TAIWAN AND THE POPE\'S 
CANONIZATION OF CHINESE MARTYRS TO AVOID AN OPEN DIALOGUE 
WITH THE VATICAN.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES 
PROGRESS FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CHINA CAN BEST BE MADE BY 
PROMOTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE BROADEST SENSE FOR ALL 
BELIEFS.  HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT USG EFFORTS WILL PAY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        VATICA  03985  01 OF 02  131618Z 
PAUL II MADE A STRONG AND EMOTIONAL APPEAL FOR PEACE IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST, CALLING ON ISRAELIES AND PALESTINIANS TO RETURN 
TO THE PATH OF NEGOTIATIONS, AND URGING THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A PRESENCE IN THE REGION \"TO 
CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE 
PARTIES.  THE POPE FORCEFULLY STATED THAT \"THERE IS NO 
JUSTIFICATION FOR THOSE WHO INDISCRIMINATELY KILL INNOCENT 
DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS.\"  HE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN FOR THE 
PLIGHT OF BOTH THE PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS, AND EMPHASIZED 
THAT NEITHER ATTACKS, ARMS, NOR WALLS OF SEPARATION WOULD 
LEAD TO A JUST SOLUTION.  FINALLY, CALLING ATTENTION TO THE 
INABILITY OF WORSHIPERS TO ATTEND SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE 
CURFEWS, HE CONDEMNED WHAT HE TERMED A RESTRICTION ON FREEDOM 
OF RELIGION AND APPEALED TO CHRISTIANS LIVING IN THE HOLY 
LANDS NOT TO ABANDON THE REGION DESPITE THE CURRENT TROUBLES.

POPE ANGUISHED BY CONTINUING VIOLENCE

2. (U) IN HIS FIRST SUNDAY ANGELUS MESSAGE SINCE HIS RETURN 
FROM CANADA, GUATEMALA AND MEXICO, POPE JOHN PAUL II CHOSE TO 
MAKE A POINTED APPEAL FOR AN END TO VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST.  OBSERVING THAT HE \"CAN\'T STOP THINKING\" ABOUT THE HOLY 
LANDS WHOSE PEOPLE HAVE NO RESPITE FROM THE \"ALMOST DAILY 
EPISODES OF ABOMINABLE VIOLENCE,\" THE POPE ASKED RHETORICALLY 
WHEN THE ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WOULD COME TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT THE ABILITY TO LIVE TOGETHER \"DOES NOT SPRING 
FROM ARMS.\"  \"NEITHER ATTACKS, NOR WALLS OF SEPARATION, NOR 
RETALIATION WILL EVER LEAD TO AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION OF THE

THE DESTRUCTION, PARTICULARLY THE INNOCENTS WHO ARE PAYING 
THE PRICE OF THE CURRENT VIOLENCE. 
 
--------------------------- 
NO JUSTIFICATION FOR TERROR 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (U) REINFORCING HIS REJECTION OF TERROR IN ALL FORMS, THE 
POPE SAID HE WANTED TO REPEAT TO ALL FROM WHATEVER ETHNIC 
GROUP THEY BELONG TO, THAT \"THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR 
THOSE WHO INDISCRIMINATELY KILL INNOCENT DEFENSELESS 
CIVILIANS.\"  CONVEYING EQUAL CONCERN FOR THE SUFFERING OF 
BOTH SIDES, THE POPE OBSERVED THAT FROM 1967 TO THE PRESENT 
THERE HAS BEEN \"A TERRIBLE SUCCESSION OF UNSPEAKABLE 
SUFFERING: SUFFERING OF THE PALESTINIANS, HUNTED FROM THEIR 
OWN LANDS OR CONSTRAINED, IN RECENT TIMES, TO A STATE OF 
PERMANENT SIEGE, OBJECTS OF A SORT OF COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT; 
SUFFERING OF THE ISRAELI POPULATION WHICH LIVES IN DAILY 
TERROR OF BEING BOMBED BY ANONYMOUS ATTACKERS.\" 
 
--------------------------------- 
APPEAL FOR INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) IN RECENT DISCUSSIONS, THE HOLY SEE HAS INTENSIFIED 
ITS PUSH FOR SOME FORM OF INTERNATIONAL INTERPOSITION FORCE 
ON THE GROUND IN THE REGION (REFTELS).  REINFORCING THIS 
MESSAGE, THE POPE CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY \"TO 
COMMIT ITSELF WITH GREAT DETERMINATION TO BE PRESENT ON THE 
GROUND, OFFERING THE NEEDED MEDIATION TO CREATE THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

5. (U) ADDING URGENCY TO HIS APPEAL TO PEACE, THE POPE 
REITERATED HIS CONCERN FOR CHRISTIANS IN THE HOLY LANDS -- 
MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN EMIGRATING TO ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE AND 
LACK OF OPPORTUNITY IN THE STRIFE-TORN REGION.  IN THIS 
CONNECTION, THE POPE ASSERTED THAT THE CURRENT RIGID CURFEW 
IMPOSED BY THE ISRAELIS HAD RESULTED IN A FUNDAMENTAL 
VIOLATION OF THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, AS BELIEVERS OF ALL 
FAITHS NO LONGER HAD ACCESS TO PLACES OF WORSHIP.

SUBJECT: VATICAN PUTS PEOPLE FIRST AT SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT SUMMIT 
 
1. \"PEOPLE COME FIRST\" WILL BE THE LEITMOTIF FOR THE VATICAN 
DELEGATION AT THE WORLD SUMMIT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. 
IN AN AUGUST 25 MESSAGE FROM HIS SUMMER RETREAT AT 
CASTELGANDOLFO, POPE JOHN PAUL II WISHED SUMMIT DELEGATES 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  04217  300908Z 
SUCCESS \"IN FINDING EFFECTIVE WAYS FOR AN INTEGRAL HUMAN 
DEVELOPMENT, KEEPING IN MIND THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION.  THE POPE DESCRIBED THE WORLD AS 
\"INCREASINGLY INTERDEPENDENT\" AND SAID WE HAVE A DIVINE CALL 
TO CULTIVATE AND PROTECT THE EARTH, ITS PEOPLE AND 
RESOURCES.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT PEACE, JUSTICE AND THE 
PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT CAN ONLY BE THE FRUIT OF 
COMMON EFFORT BY ALL HUMANITY - RICH AND POOR. 
 
2.  THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION WILL BE LED BY ARCHBISHOP RENATO 
MARTINO, THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER TO THE UNITED 
NATIONS.  ARCHBISHOP MARTINO TOLD REPORTERS AUGUST 26 THAT 
THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF THE RIO DECLARATION -- HUMAN BEINGS 
ARE AT THE CENTER OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CONCERNS -- 
WOULD BE THE BASIS FOR HIS DELEGATION\'S PARTICIPATION IN 
JOHANNESBURG.  THE RIO DOCUMENT\'S INSISTENCE ON THE PRIMACY 
OF THE PERSON IN DEVELOPMENT ISSUES WAS, ACCORDING TO 
MARTINO, A KEY HOLY SEE OBJECTIVE AT THAT MEETING. (COMMENT: 
IN PRACTICAL TERMS FOR JOHANNESBURG THIS IMPLIES THAT THE 
HOLY SEE WILL NOT BE WEDDED TO ANY PARTICULAR STRATEGY, 
PARTNERSHIP, BENCHMARK OR DEADLINE UNLESS IT PROMOTES THE 
VATICAN\'S TRADITIONAL PRIORITY OF THE VALUE OF THE HUMAN 
PERSON, FAMILY, AND SOCIETY.  END COMMENT). 
 
3. IN A PAPER PREPARED FOR THE PREPARATORY MEETINGS LEADING 
UP TO THE WSSD, THE HOLY SEE HIGHLIGHTED AS ITS PRIORITIES 
POVERTY ERADICATION, EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, EDUCATION, 
BASIC HEALTH CARE, AND ADEQUATE SHELTER.  THEY ALSO SUPPORT 
\"NEW PATTERNS OF CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION\" BASED ON 
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IN WHICH THE HUMAN PERSON 
RECOGNIZES HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP ORDER THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04217  300908Z 
WORLD.  MARTINO SIGNALED VATICAN CONCERN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF A MORE RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO MANAGING THE WORLD\'S WATER 
RESOURCES, AND WILL SUPPORT INITIATIVES AIMED AT ENSURING 
ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF DRINKING WATER. 
 
4.  THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS ON PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE TRACK 
CLOSELY WITH U.S. PERSPECTIVES.  THEIR PREPARATORY PAPER 
HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, PARTICULARLY 
IN REGARD TO FIGHTING CORRUPTION, PROMOTING GREATER 
DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION, ESTABLISHING WELL-FUNCTIONING 
BUREAUCRACIES AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS, ENFORCING LAWS, AND 
PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS.  THEY CONCLUDE THAT \"THE LACK OF 
STABLE INSTITUTIONS AND SOUND POLICIES ARE OFTEN A CAUSE OF 
POVERTY, ONES THAT EVEN INCREASED LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT 
ASSISTANCE CANNOT OVERCOME.  CORRUPTION MUST BE CONSIDERED A 
SCANDAL AND A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO DEVELOPMENT.\"

REF: STATE 160115 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: VATICAN DFM MIGLIORE TOLD DCM AUGUST 30 
THAT THE HOLY SEE SHARED U.S. GOALS ON THE CLONING CONVENTION 
AND SUPPORTED USG EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A UN CONVENTION TO BAN 
ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING.  HOWEVER, THE VATICAN FEARED THAT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  04241  01 OF 02  030554Z 
PRESSING TOO HARD FOR A COMPREHENSIVE BAN NOW MIGHT LEAD TO A 
MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE A GLOBAL BAN ON HUMAN CLONING 
THAT THE HOLY SEE REGARDS AS FUNDAMENTAL.  THE HOLY SEE IS 
PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE U.S. IN THE LEAD UP TO THE UNGA IN 
PURSUIT OF A TOTAL BAN, AND MIGLIORE TOOK ON BOARD THE NAMES 
OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH REFTEL RECOMMENDS THEY APPROACH. 
NEVERTHELESS, THE HOLY SEE IS PREPARED TO PURSUE AN 
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IF IT APPEARS THAT A COMPREHENSIVE BAN 
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE.  THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD DELETE THE 
LANGUAGE IN THE CURRENT DRAFT UN RESOLUTION THAT LEAVES OPEN 
OTHER HUMAN CLONING ACTIVITIES, WHILE RETAINING EXPLICIT 
REFERENCES TO THE INTENT TO MOVE AFTER PHASE ONE 
(REPRODUCTIVE CLONING) TO A PHASE TWO THAT WOULD BAN ALL 
OTHER FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING.  THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THIS 
WOULD ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE THAT ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING 
ARE CURRENTLY REGARDED AS \"UNACCEPTABLE.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU)  DCM PRESENTED REFTEL REQUEST TO VATICAN DFM 
CELESTINO MIGLIORE ON AUGUST 30.  MIGLIORE INDICATED HE HAD 
HEARD FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER MISSION IN NEW 
YORK ABOUT THE U.S. APPROACH, AND CAUTIONED THAT THE U.S. 
MIGHT BE TOO AMBITIOUS.  HE SAID THAT THE HOLY SEE FULLY 
SUPPORTED US EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON HUMAN 
CLONING BECAUSE WE SHARE THE SAME STRONG MORAL CONCERNS.  HE 
FEARED, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD PROVE IMPOSSIBLE TO GENERATE 
THE VOTES AT THIS TIME TO AUTHORIZE A CONVENTION ON A 
COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON HUMAN CLONING.  IN THIS CASE, THE HOLY 
SEE BELIEVED IT COULD PROVE IMPOSSIBLE TO REGAIN THE MOMENTUM 
FOR SUCH A BAN IN THE FUTURE, AND THE MOMENT TO ACHIEVE A BAN 
ON HUMAN CLONING COULD PASS.  MIGLIORE PREFERRED TO PRESS NOW 
FOR THE PHASE ONE BAN AS PROPOSED BY THE FRENCH AND GERMANS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04241  01 OF 02  030554Z 
BUT WITH CHANGED LANGUAGE IN THE AUTHORIZING RESOLUTION. 
 
3. (SBU) WHILE THE HOLY SEE AGREED THAT THE TWO PHASE 
APPROACH CARRIED RISKS, THEY HAD DEVELOPED AN ALTERNATIVE TO 
THE FRENCH AND GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT THEY BELIEVED COULD 
ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE AGAINST ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING, 
WHILE LOCKING IN A COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATIONS ON THE SECOND 
STEP.  SPECIFICALLY, THE HOLY SEE WOULD PROPOSE DELETING OP 
3(B), WHICH HE PARAPHRASED AS READING: \"THE SOCIAL COMMITTEE 
CLARIFIES THAT A BAN ON HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE CLONING IS NOT TO 
PREJUDICE THE LEGALITY OR ILLEGALITY OF OTHER HUMAN CLONING 
ACTIVITIES.\"  THIS DELETION, COMBINED WITH EXISTING LANGUAGE 
FURTHER DOWN IN THE RESOLUTION EXPLICITLY CALLING FOR BOTH A 
BAN ON REPRODUCTIVE CLONING AND A SUBSEQUENT CONVENTION 
BANNING ALL OTHER FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING WOULD ESTABLISH THE 
PRINCIPLE THAT ANY FORM OF HUMAN CLONING WAS \"INADMISSIBLE\" 
WHILE OFFERING A WAY TO MOVE FORWARD NOW, MIGLIORE MAINTAINED. 
 
4. (SBU) DCM ASSURED MIGLIORE THAT THE USG APPRECIATED THE 
HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE TO LOCK IN THE PRINCIPLE BANNING HUMAN 
REPRODUCTIVE CLONING IN THE EVENT A COMPREHENSIVE BAN 
APPEARED UNATTAINABLE.  HE REITERATED THAT AT THIS POINT, 
HOWEVER, THE US BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BUILD CONSENSUS 
FOR THE CONVENTION ON A COMPREHENSIVE BAN AND INTENDED TO 
WORK HARD TO BUILD A COALITION TO THAT END.  DCM PRESSED 
MIGLIORE TO JOIN US NOW IN PURSUIT OF A COMPREHENSIVE BAN, 
WHILE KEEPING THEIR ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IN RESERVE FOR THE 
TIME BEING.  MIGLIORE INDICATED THE HOLY SEE WOULD WORK WITH

GOES TO THE CORE OF ITS MISSION WAS SURPRISING, PARTICULARLY 
WITH POWERFUL ALLIES IN THE USG AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT 
SUPPORT A CONVENTION ADDRESSING A COMPREHENSIVE BAN.  IN THIS 
CASE, THE CAUTION REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE HOLY SEE\'S 
PRAGMATISM, BUT ALSO THE EXTREME IMPORTANCE THE HOLY SEE 
ATTACHES TO A BAN ON HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE CLONING AND DESIRE TO 
ACHIEVE AGREEMENT ON SUCH A BAN.  WE ARE CONFIDENT THE HOLY 
SEE WILL ENCOURAGE ITS UN OBSERVER IN NEW YORK AND NUNCIOS IN 
POLAND, THE PHILIPPINES, HONDURAS, ZIMBABWE, AND IVORY COAST 
TO APPROACH THE HOST GOVERNMENTS TO SEEK OUT SUPPORT FOR OUR 
APPROACH TO THE ISSUE, AND MIGLIORE HAS AGREED TO UPDATE US 
ON THEIR DISCUSSIONS.  WITH THEIR FINGER TO THE WIND, 
HOWEVER, THEY WILL TURN TO THEIR COMPROMISE IF THEY DEEM IT 
NECESSARY PRESERVE THE CHANCE FOR A FUTURE GLOBAL BAN.

1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 3. 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY:  SINCE THE START OF THE ZAMBIAN GMO FOOD AID 
CRISIS, EMBASSY VATICAN HAS PRESSED HARD AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF 
THE HOLY SEE FOR A STRONG STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF U.S. FOOD 
ASSISTANCE FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA AND BEYOND.  BUILDING ON OVER 
A YEAR OF DIALOGUE ON THE SAFETY OF GMO\'S, THE VATICAN IS 
FINALLY MOVING TOWARD ACCEPTANCE OF THE SAFETY OF GMO\'S, BUT 
HAS PREFERRED TO FOCUS NARROWLY ON THE SITUATION IN ZAMBIA. 
OUR MUTUAL INTEREST IN FEEDING THE WORLD\'S HUNGRY OFFERS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE A MORE POSITIVE PUBLIC POSITION FROM 
THE HOLY SEE ON THE SAFETY OF BIOTECH FOOD FOR HUMAN 
CONSUMPTION.  WHILE SUCH A STATEMENT WOULD DOUBTLESS BE 
CAREFULLY WORDED AND NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATE VATICAN 
CONCERNS AT ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS FROM BIOTECH CROPS, IT 
COULD FACILITATE OUR BROADER EFFORT TO ERODE EUROPEAN AND 
OTHER INTERNATIONAL NON-SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIONS TO BIOTECH 
FOODS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) ACTION REQUESTED: FOLLOWING UP ON THE SECRETARY\'S 
STATEMENT ON GMO FOODS AT THE JOHANNESBURG SUMMIT, POST 
REQUESTS DEPARTMENT CONSIDER A LETTER FROM SECRETARY POWELL 
TO VATICAN FM TAURAN URGING THE HOLY SEE TO ISSUE A PUBLIC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04361  01 OF 03  081058Z 
STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE SAFETY FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION OF 
US FOOD ASSISTANCE, SIMILAR TO EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND UN 
STATEMENTS IN REFS C AND F (PROPOSED TEXT AT PARA. 9 BELOW). 
LETTER SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR DELIVERY BY AMBASSADOR AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE, IDEALLY BEFORE AMBASSADOR RETURNS TO THE U.S. 
FOR CONSULTATIONS ON SEPTEMBER 13.  SEE PARA 9 FOR SUGGESTED 
DRAFT LANGUAGE FOR THE LETTER. END ACTION REQUEST. 
 
4. (SBU) FOLLOWING REPORTS THAT CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN ZAMBIA 
HAD SUPPORTED THE GOZ\'S DECISION TO WITHHOLD U.S. PROVIDED 
FOOD AID (REF G), POLOFF MET AUGUST 22 WITH UNDERSECRETARY OF 
THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR REFUGEES AND MIGRANT PEOPLES 
FATHER MICHAEL BLUME, AND AUGUST 23 WITH JESUIT REFUGEE 
SERVICE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA JENNY CAFISO TO 
URGE THEM TO MAKE CLEAR THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE SAFETY OF U.S. 
FOOD ASSISTANCE.  BOTH TOOK ON BOARD OUR POINTS ON FOOD AID 
FROM REF H, AND REFERRED US TO THE JESUITS AT THE LUSAKA 
OFFICE OF THE JESUIT REFUGEE SERVICE.  SUBSEQUENTLY, DCM AND 
POLOFF MET AUGUST 29 WITH VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER, 
MONSIGNOR CELESTINO MIGLIORE.  MIGLIORE HAD NOT HEARD OF THE 
ZAMBIAN IMBROGLIO, BUT PROMISED TO LOOK INTO IT. 
 
5. (C)  AT A SEPTEMBER 5 FOLLOW-UP MEETING WITH VATICAN MFA 
SOUTHERN AFRICA DIRECTOR MONS. FRANCESCO CAVINA, POLOFF 
OFFERED COPIES OF THE EC AND UN STATEMENTS SUPPORTING US FOOD 
ASSISTANCE.  NOTING THAT THE USG AND HOLY SEE SHARE A STRONG 
COMMON INTEREST IN HELPING TO FEED HUNGRY PEOPLE AROUND THE 
WORLD, POLOFF URGED THE HOLY SEE TO ISSUE A STATEMENT SIMILAR 
TO THOSE OF THE EC, UN, AND WHO.  CAVINA, WHO HAD BEEN 
BRIEFED BY MIGLIORE, SAID THE VATICAN HAD DECIDED TO TAKE 
ACTION TO CLARIFY THE CHURCH\'S POSITION.  THEIR PLAN OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  04361  01 OF 03  081058Z 
ACTION, HOWEVER, CENTERED ON A STATEMENT BY THE ZAMBIAN 
BISHOPS\' COUNCIL EMPHASIZING THE NEED TO FEED THE HUNGRY NOW, 
WITH THE FOOD ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE ALREADY IN ZAMBIA, WHILE 
SETTING ASIDE FOR LATER ARGUMENTS ABOUT AGRICULTURAL 
SUSTAINABILITY.  CAVINA ALSO SAID THE PAPAL NUNCIO IN LUSAKA 
HAD CONVOKED THE JESUIT DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR 
THEOLOGICAL REFLECTION (REF G) AND WOULD REMIND HIM OF THE 
NEED NOT TO CONTRADICT BASIC HOLY SEE POSITIONS ON SOLIDARITY 
(I.E. ON THE MORAL IMPERATIVE OF USING AVAILABLE FOOD TO FEED 
HUNGRY PEOPLE). 
 
6. (C)  WHILE WELCOMING THIS PROGRESS, POLOFF URGED CAVINA TO 
WORK UP A BROADER MESSAGE ON THE SAFETY OF BIOTECH FOOD, 
DELIVERED FROM THE HOLY SEE ITSELF.  UNDERSCORING THE REF H 
POINT THAT THE USG PROVIDES 63 PERCENT OF THE WFP\'S GLOBAL

HOLY SEE TO BUILD ON ITS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC PUBLIC STANCE 
TOWARDS BIOTECHNOLOGY. IN OUR VIEW, A STRONG PUBLIC STANCE IN 
SUPPORT OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY IS A NATURAL FOR ANYONE 
INTERESTED IN PROMOTING FOOD SECURITY IN THE DEVELOPING 
WORLD.  THE ZAMBIAN FOOD CRISIS, AS TRAGIC AS IT IS, MAY 
PRESENT A \"DEFINING MOMENT\" FOR OUR BIOTECH DIALOGUE WITH THE 
HOLY SEE.  NOBODY, AND ESPECIALLY NOT THE POPE, CAN ARGUE 
THAT A PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE SHOULD APPLY WHEN IT MEANS 
REAL HUMAN BEINGS WILL GO HUNGRY OR EVEN STARVE.  WITH U.S. 
FOOD AID SO VITAL TO ADDRESSING THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN FOOD 
CRISIS, THE HOLY SEE SHOULD BE SINGING FROM THE SAME SHEET 
WITH US. WE ARE, IN FACT, COORDINATING POSITIONS AT THE UN ON 
A CONVENTION TO BAN ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING -- THE \"FLIP

SIDE\" OF THE GMO FOOD DEBATE.  POST BELIEVES THAT THE TIME IS 
RIGHT FOR A HIGH-LEVEL APPROACH, WHICH COULD NUDGE THE HOLY 
SEE OFF THE FENCE, AT LEAST AS REGARDS THE SAFETY FOR HUMAN 
CONSUMPTION OF BIOTECH FOODS.  WHILE ANY HOLY SEE STATEMENT 
WOULD DOUBTLESS BE CAREFULLY WORDED AND NOT ERASE VATICAN 
CONCERNS AT ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS FROM BIOTECH CROPS, IT 
COULD GREATLY FACILITATE OUR BROADER EFFORT TO ERODE EUROPEAN 
AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL OBJECTIONS TO AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS 
OF BIOTECH FOODS.  (NOTE: WE WILL NEED TO ADDRESS THE HOLY 
SEE\'S CONCERNS AT POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF GMO CROPS 
IN THE FUTURE, AND POST HAS AN ACTION PLAN FOR THAT TO BE 
REPORTED SEPTEL. END NOTE.)

YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
 
THE UNITED STATES IS DEEPLY CONCERNED AT THE UNFOLDING 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  I KNOW THAT HOLY 
SEE, WHERE THE CENTRALITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON IS OF PARAMOUNT 
CONCERN, SHARES OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF AFRICAN 
LIVES NOW AT RISK FROM HUNGER AND STARVATION.

THE UNITED STATES IS CURRENTLY SEEKING TO HELP PROVIDE SAFE 
FOOD TO ALL THOSE IN NEED -- IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND ELSEWHERE 
WHERE NEEDS ARE GREAT.  THE UNITED STATES PROVIDES 
SIXTY-THREE PERCENT OF THE FOOD ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO THE WORLD 
FOOD PROGRAM, AND ALREADY THE UNITED STATES HAS PROVIDED OVER 
SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE FOOD ASSISTANCE ON THE GROUND IN 
SOUTHERN AFRICA.  THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY TO REPLACE 
THE RISING NEED FOR FOOD TO AVOID MASS STARVATION IN THIS 
REGION.  UNFORTUNATELY, SOME INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS, 
INCLUDING SOME ELEMENTS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, HAVE ARGUED 
AGAINST DISTRIBUTING U.S. FOOD ASSISTANCE BECAUSE IT CANNOT 
BE GUARANTEED TO BE FREE OF \"TRANSGENIC\" SEEDS.

SAFE TO CONSUME AS ARE THEIR CONVENTIONAL COUNTERPARTS. 
 
THE UNITED NATIONS, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, AND THE 
EUROPEAN COMMISSION AMONG OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RECENTLY 
ISSUED STATEMENTS SUPPORTING THIS VIEW.  THE UNITED STATES 
BELIEVES THAT A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS STATEMENT FROM THE HOLY 
SEE, A MORAL LEADER WHOSE VOICE IS RESPECTED THE WORLD OVER, 
REGARDING THE SAFETY OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS WOULD 
GREATLY HELP TO OVERCOME PREVAILING HESITATIONS IN AFRICA AND 
BEYOND.  IN THIS WAY, THE HOLY SEE COULD MAKE A POSITIVE 
CONTRIBUTION TO ALLEVIATING THE SUFFERING OF HUNGRY PEOPLE 
NOT JUST IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, BUT EVERYWHERE PEOPLE RECEIVE 
FOOD ASSISTANCE. 
 
IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO OVERCOME THIS GRAVE CRISIS OF 
HUMAN SUFFERING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, WE CAN THEN TURN OUR

POSITIVE COLLABORATION ON THIS VITAL MATTER.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  BURUNDI PRESIDENT BUYOYA, ATTENDING A 
SANT\'EGIDIO CONFERENCE IN PALERMO ON CONFLICT AND DIALOGUE, 
REQUESTED A MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON SEPTEMBER 1 TO 
REINFORCE HIS INTEREST IN STEPPED UP U.S. AND TANZANIAN 
PRESSURE ON THE CNDD FACTION OF THE FDD.  MEETING AT THE 
SUGGESTION OF THE SANT\'EGIDIO MEDIATOR INVOLVED IN BURUNDI, 
DON MATTEO ZUPPI, BUYOYA SAID HE BELIEVED THE U.S. SHOULD 
BOTH APPROACH THE FACTION DIRECTLY THROUGH ITS CONTACTS WITH 
THEM IN TANZANIA, AND ALSO URGE THE TANZANIAN GOVERNMENT TO 
DO MORE TO PRESSURE THE FACTION TO PARTICIPATE SERIOUSLY IN 
NEGOTIATIONS.  AMBASSADOR URGED BUYOYA TO APPROACH OUR 
EMBASSY IN BUJUMBURA DIRECTLY, BUT PROMISED TO PASS ALONG THE 
PRESIDENT\'S CONCERNS TO OUR EMBASSY AND WASHINGTON.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
BUYOYA FRUSTRATED BY CNDD/FDD RECALCITRANCE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) BURUNDI PRESIDENT BUYOYA, KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT THE 
ANNUAL SANT\'EGIDIO INTER-FAITH CONFERENCE, \"FAITHS AND 
CULTURES WITHIN CONFLICT AND DIALOGUE,\" (SEPTEL) REQUESTED A 
MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON AT THE SUGGESTION OF FATHER 
DON MATTEO ZUPPI, SANT\'EGIDIO\'S SPIRTUAL LEADER AND AFRICA 
EXPERT, WHO HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN BURUNDI AND THE REGION FOR 
MANY YEARS.  BUYOYA OUTLINED FOR THE AMBASSADOR THE STATE OF 
PLAY IN BURUNDI, STRESSING THAT ALTHOUGH MUCH PROGRESS HAS 
BEEN MADE, THE GOVERNMENT\'S INABILITY TO BRING THE REMAINING 
TWO REBEL FACTIONS INTO THE PEACE PROCESS, AND THEIR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04376  01 OF 02  091559Z 
UNWILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO A CEASE-FIRE THREATENS THE 
PROGRESS TO DATE.  ACCORDING TO BUYOYA, THE CNDD/FDD 
CONTINUES TO FIND \"PRETEXTS\" TO AVOID SUBSTANTIVE 
NEGOTIATIONS, SUCH AS INSISTING THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT 
WAS NOT A COMBATANT, AND THEREFORE ONLY THE ARMY COULD BE 
INVOLVED IN CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS.  BUYOYA SAID HE HAD 
REQUESTED INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT -- PARTICULARLY FROM TANZANIA 
-- TO CONVINCE THE CNDD/FDD TO ENGAGE SERIOUSLY IN 
NEGOTIATIONS, BUT THAT THE REBEL GROUP \"CONTINUED TO PLAY A 
DELAYING GAME.\" 
 
-------------------- 
U.S. PRESSURE NEEDED 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (C) BUYOYA SAID HIS GOVERNMENT HAD CONCLUDED THAT ONLY 
THE U.S., WORKING WITH TANZANIA, COULD OVERCOME THE CURRENT 
STALEMATE.  NOTING THAT U.S. ENGAGEMENT IN THE GREAT LAKES, 
SUDAN, AND ANGOLA HAD LED TO SOLUTIONS, HE BELIEVED SIMILAR 
ENGAGEMENT NOW IN BURUNDI WOULD BE PIVOTAL.  DESPITE CURRENT 
FRUSTRATIONS, HE BELIEVED THE \"TIME WAS RIPE FOR A SOLUTION.\" 
 OBSERVING THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CNDD/FDD REBEL LEADERS 
WERE \"WELL-KNOWN\" TO OUR EMBASSY IN TANZANIA, HE URGED THE 
U.S. TO PRESSURE THE LEADERS DIRECTLY TO ENTER NEGOTIATIONS. 
IN ADDITION, HE URGED US TO APPROACH THE GOVERNMENT OF 
TANZANIA TO STEP UP THEIR PRESSURE ON THE FDD/CNDD.  HE 
BELIEVED THAT TANZANIA HAD \"ALL THE NECESSARY WEAPONS TO PUSH 
THEM,\" BUT NEEDED MORE PRESSURE FROM THE U.S. TO BRING THEM 
TO BEAR. 
 
4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED BUYOYA FOR SHARING HIS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  04376  01 OF 02  091559Z 
PERSPECTIVES AND ASKED IF HE HAD APPROACHED OUR EMBASSY IN 
BUJUMBURA DIRECTLY WITH HIS REQUEST.  HE SAID HE HAD NOT, BUT 
THAT HE WOULD DO SO UPON HIS RETURN TO THE CAPITAL.  THE 
AMBASSADOR ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO SO, AND PROMISED TO CONVEY 
HIS VIEWS TO OUR EMBASSIES IN BUJUMBURA AND DAR-ES-SALAAM AND 
TO WASHINGTON.  HE NOTED THAT THE U.S. SHARED THE PRESIDENT\'S 
DESIRE TO BRING ALL THE REBEL GROUPS ACTIVELY INTO THE PEACE 
PROCESS. 
 
5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT THE REBELS\' OBJECTIVES, BUYOYA SAID IT 
WAS NOT CLEAR TO HIM AT THIS POINT WHAT MORE THEY NEEDED.  HE 
BELIEVED ALL THE CLAIMS THE REBELS HAD PUT FORWARD -- 
DEMOCRACY, INSTITUTIONALIZING SECURITY GUARANTEES, AND 
SETTLEMENT OF PAST CONFLICTS -- WERE ANSWERED IN THE EXISTING 
PEACE ACCORD.  THE REAL ISSUE WAS HOW TO INTEGRATE THE REBELS 
INTO THE NEW INSTITUTIONS, HE SAID.  \"WE ARE READY TO GIVE 
THEM ROOM,\" HE ADDED, \"BUT WE NEED THEM TO ENGAGE SERIOUSLY.\"

1. (U) SUMMARY:  IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 10, 
VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN LOUIS TAURAN PRAISED THE 
UNIVERSAL CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM THAT HAS FOLLOWED 
SEPTEMBER 11, WHILE CAUTIONING THAT ANY DECISION TO USE FORCE 
AGAINST IRAQ MUST BE TAKEN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS.  HE OBSERVED THAT ACTION AGAINST IRAQ MUST BE 
WEIGHED AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ, 
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, AND GLOBAL STABILITY, BUT DID NOT 
RULE OUT MILITARY ACTION IF IT OCCURED IN A UN FRAMEWORK.  IN 
HIS STRONGEST WARNING, TAURAN STATED THAT \"ONE CANNOT COMBAT 
EVIL WITH ANOTHER EVIL, ADDING EVIL TO EVIL.\" TAURAN POINTED 
TO THE POPE\'S DAY OF PRAYER FOR PEACE IN ASSISI AND HIS 
EFFORTS TO PROMOTE INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE AS HELPING TO 
SPREAD THE VIEW THAT RELIGION SHOULD NEVER BE USED TO JUSTIFY 
VIOLENCE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------ 
GOODNESS FROM EVIL 
------------------ 
 
2. (U) IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW PUBLISHED ON THE EVE OF 
THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS, HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINSTER 
JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN PROVIDED A BROAD ASSESSMENT OF THE HOLY 
SEE\'S VIEW OF THE POST-SEPTEMBER 11 INTERNATIONAL LANDSCAPE, 
ENCOMPASSING THE WAR ON TERRORISM, THE SITUATION IN IRAQ, THE 
MIDDLE EAST, AND RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND THE 
MUSLIM WORLD.  LOOKING BACK ON SEPTEMBER 11, TAURAN SAID THE 
\"ABOMINABLE ACTION\" HAD LED TO THREE IMPORTANT CHANGES IN 
INTERNATIONAL ATTITUDES:  FIRST, IT HAD LED TO A UNIVERSAL 
CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM; SECOND, IT HAD CONTRIBUTED TO 
BETTER JURIDICAL DEFINITIONS OF TERRORISM; AND THIRD, IT HAD 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04398  01 OF 02  110710Z 
HELPED FOCUS INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION ON THE CAUSES OF 
INHUMANE VIOLENCE.  FURTHERMORE, TAURAN ASSERTED THAT 
SEPTEMBER 11 HAD STRENGTHENED THE RECOGNITION AMONG LEADERS 
OF ALL FAITHS AND NATIONS THAT \"RELIGION CAN NEVER BE USED TO 
JUSTIFY TERRORISM AND THAT ALL BELIEVERS HAVE THE COMMON 
RESPONSIBILITY TO DISARM HATRED.\"  HE NOTED THAT THERE HAS 
BEEN A CHORUS OVER THE PAST YEAR AMONG BELIEVERS OF ALL 
FAITHS -- PARTICULARLY CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS, AND JEWS -- THAT 
LIFE IS SACRED AND COMES FROM GOD.  AS A RESULT, RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS HAVE STEPPED UP EFFORTS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ALL 
VIOLENCE IS CONTRARY TO GOD\'S LAW, AND MUST BE RESOLVED 
THROUGH DIALOGUE AND JUSTICE. 
 
------------------ 
DON\'T ISOLATE IRAQ 
------------------ 
 
3. (U) TURNING TO IRAQ, TAURAN EXPRESSED THE HOLY SEE\'S 
CONCERN ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF MILITARY ACTION, BUT, 
SIGNIFICANTLY, LEFT THE DOOR OPEN TO THE USE OF FORCE IF IT 
OCCURRED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS.  TAURAN 
OBSERVED THAT THE HOLY SEE ALWAYS FAVORED DIALOGUE, AND 
CAUTIONED AGAINST ISOLATING IRAQ.  \"OBVIOUSLY, YOU CANNOT 
COMBAT EVIL WITH ANOTHER EVIL, HEAPING EVIL UPON EVIL,\" 
TAURAN STATED, QUOTING FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S \"JUST WAR\" 
DOCTRINE.  HOWEVER, TAURAN CONTINUED, \"IF REFLECTING 
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND IN PARTICULAR RESOLUTIONS OF THE UN 
SECURITY COUNCIL, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY JUDGES IT 
OPPORTUNE TO RESORT TO PROPORTIONATE USE OF FORCE, SUCH AN 
ACTION MUST TAKE PLACE WITH A DECISION TAKEN BY THE UN, AFTER 
HAVING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE CIVIL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  04398  01 OF 02  110710Z 
POPULATION OF IRAQ, COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, AND GLOBAL 
STABILITY.\"  ULTIMATELY, HE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE TYPE OF 
OPERATIONS NOW BEING CONSIDERED WOULD GIVE RISE TO LASTING 
PEACE, ADDING, \"WE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO CONFUSE JUSTICE 
WITH VENDETTA AND ENSURE THAT ENTIRE POPULATIONS DO NOT PAY 
FOR THE CRUELTY OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTACKS.\" 
 
------------------------------------- 
FIGHTING TERROR IS NOT FIGHTING ISLAM 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) ASKED ABOUT THE HOLY SEE\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ISLAM 
AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, TAURAN SAID IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE CLEAR 
THAT FIGHTING AGAINST TERROR DOES NOT MEAN FIGHTING ISLAM. 
HE NOTED THAT AMERICAN BISHOPS MADE THIS CLEAR AFTER

CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES, D. BRENT HARDT 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE HOLY SEE PRESENTS DISTINCTIVE CHALLENGES 
AND OPPORTUNITIES IN REGARD TO IRAQ PUBLIC DIPLOMACY.  UNLIKE 
MOST POSTS, OUR \"PUBLIC\" WITHIN THE VATICAN IS LIMITED, BUT 
THE PUBLIC REACH OF THE VATICAN IS TRULY GLOBAL AND AMONG THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  04444  01 OF 02  130613Z 
MOST IMPORTANT VOICES WE CAN SEEK TO INFLUENCE.  AS WE HAVE 
RECENTLY REPORTED (REFS B AND C), THE HOLY SEE IS CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE IRAQI REGIME, BUT OPPOSED TO MILITARY ACTION BASED 
ON THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE AT THIS TIME.  DESPITE ITS 
TRADITIONAL OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF FORCE, THE HOLY SEE\'S 
FOREIGN MINISTER DID LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF MILITARY 
ACTION, BUT ONLY AFTER CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE 
IRAQI PEOPLE THE REGION, AND GLOBAL STABILITY, AND ONLY 
WITHIN A U.N. FRAMEWORK.  OUR FIRST PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
CHALLENGE IS THEREFORE TO MAKE OUR CASE FOR ACTION TO THE 
POPE AND SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------- 
MAKING OUR CASE 
--------------- 
 
2. (C) THE HOLY SEE RECOGNIZES THE SECURITY RISK POSED BY 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AND THE THREATS SADDAM POSES TO 
HIS PEOPLE AND THE REGION.  THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE CONVINCED 
OF THE NATURE OF SADDAM\'S CHARACTER, HIS HISTORY IN POWER, OR 
THE POTENTIAL RISKS THAT HE POSES.  WHAT HAS BEEN LACKING, 
FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S PERSPECTIVE, BASED ON RECENT DISCUSSIONS 
AND PRESENTATIONS BY SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS, IS THE 
FOLLOWING: 
 
-- A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY IRAQ CANNOT BE CONTAINED 
SHORT OF DIRECT MILITARY ACTION; 
 
-- COMPELLING JUSTIFICATION AS TO WHY THE THREAT FROM IRAQ IS 
GREATER TODAY THAN DURING THE PAST SO THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE 
IMMEDIATE ACTION; 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04444  01 OF 02  130613Z 
 
-- A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS AND POTENTIAL TO 
THE IRAQI PEOPLE, THE REGION, AND GLOBAL STABILITY OF BOTH 
TAKING ACTION VERSUS NOT TAKING ACTION (THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES 
THERE IS A GREAT RISK THAT MILITARY ACTION IN THE REGION 
COULD LEAD TO A MUCH LARGER CONFLAGRATION THAT COULD DRAW 
ISRAEL INTO WAR IN WAYS THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY 
DEVASTATING); 
 
-- A CONVINCING CASE THAT THE WORLD COMMUNITY HAS EXHAUSTED 
ALL OPTIONS AND MUST ACT TO AVERT A GREATER CALAMITY. 
 
----------------------------- 
ADDRESSING THE JUST WAR ISSUE 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C)  ULTIMATELY, THE HOLY SEE\'S PUBLIC STANCE ON AN 
INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO IRAQ -- IN PARTICULAR WHETHER IT 
WILL EITHER ACQUIESCE IN OR SUPPORT MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ 
-- WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER SUCH A RESPONSE MEETS THE HOLY 
SEE\'S JUST WAR DOCTRINE AS ENUNCIATED IN THE CATHOLIC 
CATECHISM.  TO THE EXTENT THAT U.S. DIPLOMATIC AND PUBLIC 
DIPLOMACY EFFORTS CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT SUCH ACTION MEETS 
THE JUST WAR CRITERIA, THE PROSPECTS FOR VATICAN

TAURAN\'S INSISTENCE THAT ANY MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ \"SHOULD

AS THE RELEVANT LEGAL AUTHORITY TO SANCTION ANY MILITARY MOVE

5. (C) THE HOLY SEE NATURALLY VIEWS ITS ROLE AS THAT OF AN 
INTERNATIONAL VOICE FOR PEACE AND RECONCILIATION AND A 
\"BUILDER OF BRIDGES\" BETWEEN PEOPLES.  IN ADDITION, THE POPE 
HAS LABORED HARD TO AVOID A GLOBAL DRIFT TOWARD A \"CLASH OF 
CIVILIZATIONS.\"  THIS CONCERN NOT ONLY REFLECTS THE HOLY 
SEE\'S TRADITIONAL CONCERN FOR THE PHYSICAL SAFETY OF 
CATHOLICS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE A MINORITY, BUT ALSO 
ITS ROLE AS A MORAL AND SPIRITUAL  VOICE FOR MANKIND.  AS A 
FIRST STEP IN BUILDING SUPPORT WITHIN THE HOLY SEE, WE 
REITERATE OUR REQUEST FOR SENIOR LEVEL BRIEFINGS THE 
RATIONALE FOR ACTION, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ACTION ON THE 
REGION, AND PROSPECTS FOR STABILITY AFTER MILITARY ACTION. 
 
6. (C) IN THE SAME WAY THE USG DEVELOPED A MUTUALLY 
BENEFICIAL DIALOGUE WITH POPE JOHN PAUL II DURING THE COLD 
WAR, POST BELIEVES A SIMILAR DIALOGUE ON THE INTERNATIONAL 
RESPONSE TO TERRORISM WOULD OFFER SIMILAR MUTUAL BENEFITS. 
HIGH-LEVEL BRIEFINGS WOULD UNDERSCORE OUR DEEP REFLECTION ON

7. (C) BEYOND SUCH DIRECT USG ENGAGEMENT, U.S. EXPERTS ON 
JUST WAR SUCH AS MICHAEL NOVAK ALREADY HAVE A STRONG 
REPUTATION WITHIN THE HOLY SEE.  A PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN 
SHOULD SEEK TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR VIEWS AND PERHAPS EVEN SOLICIT 
THEM AS SPEAKERS AND INTERLOCUTORS FOR THE EMBASSY AND HOLY 
SEE.  IN ADDITION, PROMINENT FOREIGN POLICY AUTHORITIES SUCH 
AS HENRY KISSINGER AND ZBIGNIEW BREZEZINSKI HAVE INDEPENDENT 
ACCESS TO THE HOLY SEE AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO SHARE 
THEIR VIEWS ON IRAQ AND THE NEED TO RESPOND TO TERRORISM 
DIRECTLY.

SUBJECT: VATICAN IRE AT NEW RUSSIAN \"NYET\" TO ITS CLERGY 
 
1.   THE VATICAN HAS SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE RECENT EXPULSION 
OF TWO POLISH PRIESTS FROM RUSSIA.  THIS BRINGS TO FIVE THE 
NUMBER OF CATHOLIC CLERGY EXPELLED FROM RUSSIA THIS YEAR, 
INCLUDING BISHOP JERZY MAZUR OF THE SIBERIAN DIOCESE OF ST. 
JOSEPH.  A TERSE STATEMENT ISSUED SEPTEMBER 9 BY VATICAN 
SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS WARNED, \"THIS DEVELOPMENT IS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  04470  131302Z 
SO SERIOUS THAT ALREADY SOME PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT A NEW 
PERSECUTION.\"  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD YET TO RECEIVE AN 
OFFICIAL EXPLANATION FOR THE EXPULSIONS.  THE HOLY SEE\'S 
NUNCIO IN MOSCOW, ARCHBISHOP GIORGIO ZUR, HAS PROTESTED TO 
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY AND VOICED THE VATICAN\'S 
CONCERN ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS FOR 
RUSSIA\'S CATHOLIC MINORITY.   THE HEAD OF RUSSIA\'S CATHOLIC 
COMMUNITY, ARCHBISHOP TADEUSZ KONDRUSIEWICZ, APPEALED 
SEPTEMBER 12 TO RUSSIAN AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
GROUPS TO PROTEST WHAT HE CALLED A \"LARGE SCALE ANTI- 
CATHOLIC CAMPAIGN.\"  THE ARCHBISHOP ALSO LAMENTED RECENT 
ACTS OF VANDALISM AGAINST CATHOLIC PROPERTIES. 
 
2.   REFLECTING THE HOLY SEE\'S MOUNTING CONCERN WITH THE 
SITUATION IN RUSSIA, HEADS OF ACCREDITED MISSIONS HAVE BEEN 
CALLED TO A MEETING SEPTEMBER 16 DURING WHICH FOREIGN 
MINISTER TAURAN WILL BRIEF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE HOLY 
SEE\'S POSITION ON THE PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH IN RUSSIA. 
 
3.   COMMENT: THE CLERGY EXPULSIONS BEGAN AFTER THE VATICAN 
ELEVATED THE STATUS OF FOUR RUSSIAN CATHOLIC ECCLESIASTICAL 
JURISDICTIONS LAST FEBRUARY, A MOVE SEVERELY CRITICIZED BY 
THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  THE FACT THAT SOME RUSSIAN 
CATHOLICS AND CLERGY ARE OF POLISH ORIGIN IS ALSO A FACTOR 
IN THE TENSION.  POLISH CLERGY ARE ACCUSED BY THE ORTHODOX 
OF BEING ANTI-RUSSIAN.  THEIR CRITICS SAY THEY CELEBRATE 
MASS IN POLISH, FOMENT ANTI-RUSSIAN SENTIMENTS AND DON\'T 
LEARN THE LANGUAGE. YET THE HOLY SEE SAYS THEY SEND POLISH 
AND OTHER SLAVIC CLERGY TO RUSSIA BECAUSE A) THEY CAN LEARN 
THE LANGUAGE EASILY, B) THEY UNDERSTAND RUSSIAN CULTURE AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04470  131302Z 
C) THERE AREN\'T YET ENOUGH TRAINED RUSSIAN PRIESTS.  THE 
ORTHODOX CHURCH NEVERTHELESS REGARDS CATHOLICISM AS AN 
ELEMENT OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION THAT BOTH FASCINATES AND 
DISTURBS.  AT A TIME WHEN SECULAR RUSSIA IS OPENING UP MORE 
AND MORE TO THE WEST, THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, FOR WHICH SUCH 
OPENNESS IS A THREAT TO THE NATIONAL, CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS 
IDENTITY OF RUSSIA, WILL EXERCISE ITS STILL CONSIDERABLE 
INFLUENCE WITH THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES TO PROTECT ITS 
POSITION.  END COMMENT.

PAGE 02        VATICA  04483  131612Z 
CELESTINO MILGIORE, EMPHASIZING THE PRESIDENT\'S FOCUS ON THE 
UN\'S ROLE IN ADVANCING HUMAN DIGNITY, AND THE CHALLENGE TO 
THAT DIGNITY AND TO THE UN POSED BY SADDAM\'S DECADE OF 
DEFIANCE OF UN RESOLUTIONS.  MIGLIORE WELCOMED THE 
PRESIDENT\'S DECISION TO WORK WITH THE UN AS WE GO FORWARD. 
HE EXPRESSED SOME DISCOMFORT WITH THE SPEECH\'S IMPLICATION 
THAT THE U.S. WOULD ACT WITH OR WITHOUT THE UN.  NOTING THAT 
FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN HAD JUST OUTLINED THE HOLY SEE\'S 
POSITION ON CONFLICT IN IRAQ IN A SEPTEMBER 11 INTERVIEW (REF 
B), AND THAT TAURAN WOULD BE CALLING IN THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
SEPTEMBER 16 TO OUTLINE FURTHER THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS, 
MIGLIORE DID NOT PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED REACTION. 
 
2. (C)  MIGLIORE DID SAY THAT A RECENT ARTICLE BY UK CARDINAL 
CORMAC MURPHY-O\'CONNOR (WHICH CAN BE READ AT: 
HTTP://WWW.CATHOLIC-EW.ORG.UK) WAS BEING WIDELY READ WITHIN 
THE VATICAN, AND CONSIDERED AS A \"BALANCED AND WISE\" 
PERSPECTIVE.  MIGLIORE SAID THE HOLY SEE SHARES 
MURPHY-O\'CONNOR\'S VIEW THAT MILITARY ACTION WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE CONVINCING 
ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS INCLUDING: 
 
-- WHETHER THE PURPOSE OF MILITARY ACTION IS TO NEUTRALIZE A 
THREAT OR EFFECT A CHANGE IN REGIME; 
 
-- WHETHER MILITARY ACTION WILL STABILIZE OR DESTABILIZE THE 
REGION; 
 
-- WHETHER IT WILL DELAY OR ADVANCE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
PROCESS; 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04483  131612Z 
-- WHETHER THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND EU WILL ENDORSE IT; 
AND 
 
-- THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BROADER STRUCTURE OF 
INTERNATIONAL LAW. 
 
IN ADDITION, MIGLIORE ASSERTED THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE MORE 
THINKING ABOUT A POST-SADDAM \"END-STATE.\"  (POST HAS 
PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED MIGLIORE WITH BACKGROUND ON OUR EFFORTS 
WITH IRAQI OPPOSITION GROUPS.)  HE QUERIED WHAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COULD DO TO ENSURE THAT A CONFLICT 
WOULD NOT RESULT IN EVER-GREATER SUFFERING. 
 
3. (C)  CHARGE PROVIDED MIGLIORE WITH A COPY OF THE 
BACKGROUND PAPER, \"A DECADE OF DECEPTION AND DEFIANCE,\" 
STRESSING THAT IT LAYS OUT A DETAILED, IMPARTIAL, AND FACTUAL 
CASE ON THE NATURE OF IRAQI DEFIANCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
AND ITS THREATS TO ITS PEOPLE, THE REGION AND THE WORLD.  HE 
URGED THE HOLY SEE TO REVIEW THIS IN DETAIL AS IT FURTHER 
EVALUATES THE PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH AND THE WAY FORWARD ON IRAQ. 
 
4. (C)  RESPONDING TO CHARGE\'S COMMENT THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
MUCH PUBLIC DISCUSSION RECENTLY IN VATICAN CIRCLES OF THE 
TENETS OF JUST WAR, MIGLIORE SAID THE HOLY SEE IS MOVING AWAY 
FROM REFERRING TO \"JUST WAR\" IN FAVOR OF DISCUSSING \"CRITERIA 
FOR THE ETHICAL PROSECUTION OF CONFLICTS AMONG STATES.\" 
 
5.  COMMENT:  MIGLIORE REITERATED HIS VIEW (REF C) THAT THE 
HOLY SEE RECOGNIZES THE PROBLEMS POSED BY SADDAM, AND HE WAS 
CLEARLY GRATIFIED THAT THE U.S. HAD DECIDED TO ENGAGE THROUGH 
THE UNITED NATIONS.  THE DEBATE WITHIN THE HOLY SEE NOW IS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  04483  131612Z 
WHETHER THE WAY FORWARD OUTLINED BY THE PRESIDENT -- WITH ITS 
CLEAR IMPLICATION OF EVENTUAL MILITARY ACTION -- IS THE ONLY 
WAY FORWARD, OR WHETHER IT CARRIES MORE RISKS THAN THE 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS IT WOULD BRING.  FM TAURAN\'S SEPTEMBER 16 
BRIEFING WILL PROVIDE THE HOLY SEE\'S INITIAL ANSWER.

 1. (C) FOLLOWING THE HOLY SEE\'S REBUKE OF RUSSIA BEFORE OSCE 
CHIEFS OF MISSION TO THE HOLY SEE FOR ITS SERIES OF 
EXPULSIONS AND VISA DENIALS TO CATHOLIC CLERGY (REF A), 
VATICAN OSCE DESK OFFICER TOLD POLOFF SEPTEMBER 30 THAT THE 
HOLY SEE PLANS TO SEEK REDRESS WITHIN THE OSCE FOR THE 
CANCELLATION OF VISAS AND/OR EXPULSION OF FIVE CATHOLIC 
CLERGY BY RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES.  FM JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN HAS 
DECIDED TO PURSUE THE ISSUE IN THE OSCE BY INVOKING ALREADY 
AGREED OSCE AND UN LANGUAGE FROM DECLARATIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  IN DOING SO, THE HOLY SEE HOPES TO 
AVOID SINGLING OUT RUSSIA FOR FAILINGS SHARED BY A NUMBER OF 
OTHER MOSTLY FORMER SOVIET OSCE MEMBER STATES.  THE HOLY SEE 
BELIEVES THE RUSSIAN VISA REFUSALS AND EXPULSIONS HAVE 
CREATED A &REAL OBSTACLE FOR PEOPLE TO EXERCISE THEIR 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN RUSSIA TODAY.8 END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C)  HOLY SEE OSCE DESK OFFICER MONS. ETTORE BALESTRERO 
OUTLINED FOR POLOFF SEPTEMBER 30 THE HOLY SEE,S OSCE-BASED 
STRATEGY TO PRESSURE RUSSIA TO REVERSE A SERIES OF RECENT 
VISA DENIALS AND EXPULSIONS OF CATHOLIC CLERGY (REFS C AND 
D).  THEY ARE SEEKING RUSSIAN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ITS 
COMMITMENTS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS LEVERAGE TO GET RUSSIAN 
AUTHORITIES TO ISSUE THE CATHOLIC CLERGY ENTRY AND VISAS THEY 
HAVE RECENTLY DENIED.  BALESTRERO TOLD US THE HOLY SEE 
INTENDS TO PURSUE THE CASE IN THE OSCE, INITIALLY AT THE 
OCTOBER 4 PC IN VIENNA.  THEY HOPE TO GAIN AGREEMENT THERE TO 
PURSUE A DECLARATION REAFFIRMING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO BE ISSUED AT THE PORTO MINISTERIAL IN 
DECEMBER.  THE HOLY SEE CONSIDERS THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT\'S

VISA REFUSALS AND EXPULSIONS AS SERIOUS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
ISSUES THAT HAVE CREATED A &REAL OBSTACLE FOR PEOPLE TO 
EXERCISE THEIR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN RUSSIA TODAY.8  AT THE 
SAME TIME, BALESTRERO SAID HE DIDN\'T DETECT ANY ANTI-CATHOLIC 
SENTIMENT IN HIS RUSSIAN INTERLOCUTORS AT THE WARSAW HUMAN 
DIMENSION MEETING, BUT HE ENCOUNTERED THE SAME COMMENT 
REPORTED REF A -) THAT THIS WAS A MATTER FOR THE HOLY SEE TO 
WORK OUT DIRECTLY WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. 
 
3. (C) CONTRARY TO THE CLAIM REPORTED REF. B, THE HOLY SEE 
DOES NOT BELIEVE IT MISSTEPPED IN CREATING THE FOUR DIOCESES 
THAT THE GOR CLAIMS TRIGGERED THE RECENT RASH OF VISA 
REFUSALS/EXPULSIONS OF CATHOLIC CLERGY.  THEY MAINTAIN THAT 
ESTABLISHING THE DIOCESES WAS A NORMAL AND LONG OVERDUE 
RESPONSE TO AN ABNORMAL SITUATION FOR THE CATHOLIC FAITHFUL 
IN RUSSIA.  BALESTRERO DID CONCEDE THAT MANY IN RUSSIA 
UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT UNDERSTAND JUST HOW ROUTINE AN ACT THE 
UPGRADING WAS.  HE SPECULATED THAT SOME LOCAL RUSSIAN 
ORTHODOX CLERGY MAY HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN TO LOCAL GOR 
OFFICIALS BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE MOVE, AND THAT 
THOSE CONCERNS COULD HAVE BEEN PASSED UP TO CENTRAL 
AUTHORITIES.  IN THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEW THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX 
CLERGY AND SOME IN THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WERE LOOKING FOR AN 
EXCUSE TO SUPPRESS THE CATHOLIC CLERGY, AND GOT IT WHEN THE 
HOLY SEE UPGRADED THE APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATIONS TO DIOCESES. 
HE BELIEVED THAT IF THE HOLY SEE HADN\'T MADE THE DIOCESAN 
DECISION, SOMETHING ELSE WOULD HAVE SERVED AS THE OCCASION 
FOR THE ACTIONS.  AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE STRESSED, THE 
VISAS AND ENTRY PERMITS WERE REFUSED BY CIVIL, NOT CHURCH 
AUTHORITIES, IN VIOLATION OF RUSSIA\'S SOLEMN INTERNATIONAL 
COMMITMENTS.

PAGE 04        VATICA  04742  01 OF 02  011200Z 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT: THERE ARE VERY FEW APOSTOLIC 
ADMINISTRATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  MOST ARE IN PLACES 
LIKE PRIZREN IN KOSOVO, OR THE CORMOROS.  ALL OF THEM ARE 
SEEN TO BE TEMPORARY MEASURES UNTIL THE MORE NORMAL CONDITION 
OF A DIOCESE IS ESTABLISHED.  THE CREATION OF A DIOCESE 
ESSENTIALLY GIVES ITS BISHOP MORE AUTONOMY FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY 
RUNNING OF CHURCH AFFAIRS.  THE HOLY SEE UNDERTOOK NUMEROUS 
MEASURES TO ALLEVIATE ANY HEARTBURN BY THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX 
CHURCH WHEN CREATING THESE DIOCESES AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE 
OF APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, THEY AVOIDED 
NAMING THEM FOR THEIR SEES, AS IN &MOSCOW,8 SO THAT THERE 
WOULD NOT BE A CATHOLIC BISHOP OF MOSCOW AT THE SAME TIME AS 
THERE WAS AN ORTHODOX BISHOP OF MOSCOW.  AND IN SAKHALIN, 
THEY NAMED A POLE, BISHOP MAZUR, INSTEAD OF THE JAPANESE, 
BISHOP PETER JINUSHI, PRECISELY TO AVOID ANY IMPLICATION THAT 
THE HOLY SEE SUPPORTS THE RETURN OF SOUTHERN SAKHALIN TO 
JAPAN.  NEVERTHELESS, THE HOLY SEE FEELS STRONGLY THAT THE 
CHURCH HAS TO TAKE CARE OF ITS OWN BUSINESS IN RUSSIA AS 
ELSEWHERE, AND CANNOT SACRIFICE ITS PASTORAL REQUIREMENTS 
INDEFINITELY TO PLACATE THE UNFOUNDED FEARS OF THE RUSSIAN 
ORTHODOX CHURCH.

BIOTECH FOOD SAFETY AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN FOOD CRISIS

1.   (SBU)  IN HIS REPLY TO SECRETARY POWELL\'S LETTER 
REQUESTING A STRONG HOLY SEE STATEMENT REGARDING THE SAFETY 
OF U.S. BIOTECH FOOD ASSISTANCE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA (REF B), 
HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINISTER EQUIVALENT ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS 
TAURAN GAVE NO INDICATION THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD OFFER A 
STRONG PUBLIC STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF U.S. FOOD ASSISTANCE, 
BUT REAFFIRMED THAT THE VATICAN IS OPEN TO FULL ACCEPTANCE 
OF BIOTECH FOOD TECHNOLOGY AFTER \"PROPER\" SCIENTIFIC STUDY. 
FURTHERMORE, HE AGREED THAT BIOTECH FOODS SHOULD BE SHARED 
WITH LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.  TAURAN\'S DEPUTY TOLD DCM 
OCTOBER 3 THAT AS A RESULT OF THE LETTER, PAPAL NUNCIO\'S IN 
THE REGION HAD BEEN PROVIDED THE CONCLUSIONS OF A 1998 STUDY 
GROUP DOCUMENT OF THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE (WHICH WAS 
GENERALLY POSITIVE TOWARD CONSUMPTION OF BIOTECH FOODS) AND 
ASKED THAT THE NUNCIOS SHARE THIS WITH THE BISHOPS IN THE 
REGION.  DESPITE THE CAUTIOUS TENOR OF THE LETTER AND ITS 
SUPPORT FOR LABELING OF BIOTECH FOODS, POST REGARDS THIS 
LETTER AS A SMALL STEP FORWARD IN OBTAINING THE HOLY SEE\'S 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR REJECTION OF 
BIOTECH FOODS. 
 
2.  (SBU)  THE RESPONSE, COUCHED WITH CHARACTERISTIC VATICAN 
CAUTION, CONVEYS THE HOLY SEE\'S APPRECIATION OF THE U.S. 
ROLE IN OFFERING ASSISTANCE TO ALLEVIATE FURTHER HUNGER AND 
STARVATION.  WHILE ASSERTING THAT THE HOLY SEE IS \"NOT IN A 
POSITION\" TO EVALUATE WHETHER COUNTRIES SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT 
USE SPECIFIC FOODS, IT OFFERS A NUMBER OF GENERALLY POSITIVE 
\"CONSIDERATIONS\" LEADING TO THE VIEW THAT THERE IS NO REASON 
FOR REJECTION OF BIOTECH FOODS, WHICH \"SHOULD BE AVAILABLE 
TO POPULATIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.\"  AT THE SAME TIME, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04909  01 OF 02  081513Z 
THE HOLY SEE INSISTED THAT THE USE OF BIOTECH FOODS SHOULD 
BE ACCOMPANIED BY A \"RIGOROUS AND PROPORTIONED CAUTION\" AND 
SHOULD BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED FOR THE PUBLIC. 
 
3. (U)  THE 1998 STUDY OF THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE TO 
WHICH TAURAN REFERS PROVIDED A GENERALLY POSITIVE ASSESSMENT 
OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF BIOTECH FOODS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT 
CONCEDED THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY WAS \"WITHOUT DOUBT A FORMIDABLE 
TOOL FOR PRODUCING MORE AND BETTER FOOD.\"  BUT IT ALSO SAID 
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY \"MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A RESPECT FOR 
THE ENVIRONMENT,\" AND, \"DEVELOPED COUNTRIES MUST FIND WAYS 
TO SHARE BIOTECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY WITH DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES.\"  THE REPORT CONCLUDES WITH NORMAN BORLAUG\'S 
FAMOUS QUIP: \"WE CAN\'T TURN BACK THE HANDS OF TIME AND ONLY 
USE TECHNOLOGIES APPROPRIATE FOR A MUCH LESS POPULATED 
WORLD.\"  WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE ACADEMY TO MOVE 
THEIR ASSESSMENT BEYOND THIS STUDY BY DEVELOPING 
OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPOSE ITS STAFF AND MANAGEMENT TO VISITING 
BIOTECH SCIENTISTS AND BIO-ETHICISTS.  WE WILL WORK WITH ITS 
SISTER ACADEMY - THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY OF THE SCIENCES - TO 
SUPPORT A PROPOSED \"STUDY WEEK\" ON BIOTECHNOLOGY BY 
COORDINATING THE PARTICIPATION OF RESPECTED US SCIENTISTS. 
 
 4. (U) IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PUSH TO HAVE THE HOLY SEE 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE STRONG MORAL ARGUMENT THAT U.S. FOOD 
ASSISTANCE IS SAFE AND SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO HUNGRY 
PEOPLE, THE AMBASSADOR TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AN OCTOBER 4 
CONFERENCE ON THE ETHICS OF GMO TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE 
PHILIPPINES, ORGANIZED ON THE MARGINS OF THE CANONIZATION OF 
JOSE MARIA ESCRIVA, FOUNDER OF THE OPUS DEI PRELATURE.  THE 
AUDIENCE, CONSISTING OF PHILIPPINE BISHOPS AND SELECTED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  04909  01 OF 02  081513Z 
BUSINESSMEN, WAS TREATED TO A GOOD PROGRAM OF EXPERTS IN 
BIOETHICS AND BIOENGINEERING FROM VARIOUS PONTIFICAL 
ACADEMIES IN SUPPORT OF GMO TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE 
PHILIPPINES.  THE AUDIENCE WAS RECEPTIVE TO AMBASSADOR\'S 
STRONG ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE MORALITY OF PROVIDING SAFE 
U.S. FOOD ASSISTANCE TO THE HUNGRY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  THE 
ONLY SOUR NOTE WAS WHEN A VATICAN DESK OFFICER REPEATEDLY 
INSISTED THAT THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS OF THE 
PONTIFICAL ACADEMIES WERE NOT THOSE OF THE VATICAN ITSELF 
AND ASSERTED (FALSELY - SEE BELOW) THAT THE VATICAN HAS NO 
POSITION ON BIOTECH FOODS.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRESENTATION, 
A GROUP OF PHILIPPINE BISHOPS TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THEY FULLY 
SUPPORTED HIS ARGUMENTS, AND BELIEVED THE PHILIPPINES SHOULD 
MOVE AHEAD MORE AGGRESSIVELY TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE BIOTECH 
FOODS.

FROM THE VATICAN, OCTOBER 2, 2002 
 
YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
 
     I AM PLEASED TO ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF YOUR LETTER 
CONCERNING BIOTECH FOODS THAT THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY TO 
THE HOLY SEE FORWARDED TO ME ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2002. 
 
     THE HOLY SEE IS AWARE OF THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN 
SOUTHERN AFRICA AND APPRECIATES THE ROLE OF THE UNITED 
STATES IN OFFERING ASSISTANCE, INCLUDING BIOTECH FOODS, IN 
ORDER TO ALLEVIATE FURTHER HUNGER AND STARVATION IN THE 
REGION. 
 
     THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE HAS EXAMINED THE 
QUESTION OF BIOTECH FOODS AND IN 1998 PUBLISHED THE WRITINGS 
OF A STUDY GROUP IN A BOOK IN ITALIAN ENTITLED 
\"BIOTECNOLOGIE ANIMALI E VEGETALI.  NUOVE FRONTIERE E NUOVE 
RESPONSIBILIT.\" 
 
     WHILE THE HOLY SEE IS NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE ANY 
TYPE OF EVALUATION ON SINGLE PRODUCTS OR WHETHER SINGLE 
COUNTRIES SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT USE SUCH FOODS, IT DOES 
NONETHELESS OFFER THESE CONSIDERATIONS ON THE MATTER: 
 
A)   THERE IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF BIOTECH FOODS. 
THEY CAN BE JUSTIFIED INASMUCH AS THEY CAN EXIST FOR THE 
GOOD OF THE HUMAN PERSON.  GOD HAS DESTINED ANIMALS AND 
VEGETABLES FOR THE GOOD OF THE HUMAN PERSON AND HAS PLACED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04909  02 OF 02  081513Z 
THEM UNDER HIS OR HER CARE. 
 
B)   IN THE NAME OF THE GOOD OF EVERY HUMAN PERSON, IT IS 
MORALLY REQUIRED THAT ALL MEASURE BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT 
THERE ARE NO RISKS TO THE HEALTH OF HUMAN BEINGS.  HERE THE 
PRINCIPLE OF PRECAUTION IS FOLLOWED, WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE 
AN ABSOLUTE REJECTION, BUT RATHER A RIGOROUS AND 
PROPORTIONED CAUTION ANALOGOUS TO THAT USED FOR 
PHARMACEUTICAL GOODS. 
 
C)   IT IS NECESSARY THAT BIOTECH FOODS, ONCE THEY ARE 
AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION, BE IDENTIFIED AS SUCH WITH 
AN APPROPRIATE LABEL, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT DANGEROUS.  THIS 
PROCEDURE WOULD BE IN LINE WITH THE RIGHT OF THE CONSUMER TO 
APPROPRIATE INFORMATION. 
 
D)   SUCH FOODS SHOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO POPULATIONS IN 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SUBJECT TO PREVIOUS VERIFICATIONS OF 
THE ETHICAL CONDITIONS AND IN LINE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF 
JUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY WITH REFERENCE TO COMMERCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC QUESTIONS. 
 
I AVAIL MYSELF OF THE OCCASION TO EXTEND TO YOUR EXCELLENCY 
THE ASSURANCES OF MY HIGHEST CONSIDERATION.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 (D). 
 
1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST, PLEASE SEE LAST PARA. 
 
2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE POPE, CATHOLIC 
PATRIARCH OF JERUSALEM MICHEL SABBAH MADE AN URGENT PLEA TO 
AMBASSADOR OCTOBER 10 FOR U.S. HELP TO STOP THE VIOLENCE, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  04991  01 OF 03  141419Z 
AMELIORATE THE INCREASINGLY DESPERATE PLIGHT OF THE 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, AND MOVE THE PARTIES TOWARD MEANINGFUL 
DIALOGUE.  SABBAH HAD MET WITH THE POPE THE DAY BEFORE TO 
CONVEY HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN JERUSALEM AND THE 
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES.  ACCORDING TO SABBAH, BOTH THE 
PALESTINIAN AND ISRAELI PEOPLE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT 
THE CURRENT CYCLE OF VIOLENCE SERVED NO PURPOSE, BUT THEY 
NEEDED TO BE \"SAVED\" FROM THEIR CURRENT BLOODY IMPASSE BY 
OUTSIDE PRESSURE.  ONLY U.S. INTERVENTION, HE INSISTED, COULD 
MOVE THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT FROM ITS CURRENT POLICY OF 
REPRESSION.  SABBAH, WHO PARTICIPATES IN THE \"ALEXANDRIA 
GROUP\" -- AN INTER-FAITH RELIGIOUS FORUM ENCOMPASSING 
CHRISTIAN, JEWISH, AND MUSLIM LEADERS -- ASSERTED THAT THIS 
GROUP HAD CONTACTS WITH HAMAS AND THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, 
AND COULD SECURE A CESSATION IN TERRORIST ATTACKS OF \"MORE 
THAN A MONTH\" IF ONLY THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT WOULD OFFER A 
\"REAL PROMISE\" OF EASING THE PALESTINIANS\' SUFFERING.  SABBAH 
CONDEMNED PALESTINIAN TERRORISM AND \"HATE SPEECH\", BUT SAID 
IT WAS A MANIFESTATION OF PALESTINIAN DESPERATION THAT WOULD 
STOP ONLY WHEN THE OCCUPATION AND \"WAR\" ENDED.  SEEING NO 
SIGNS THAT THE SHARON GOVERNMENT WAS INTERESTED IN PEACE, 
SABBAH ASKED THE AMBASSADOR TO CONVEY TO THE PRESIDENT HIS 
URGENT PLEA FOR INTERVENTION FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO 
SECURE SOME MEANINGFUL CONCESSION FROM THE GOI THAT WOULD 
GIVE THE ALEXANDRIA GROUP THE LEVERAGE IT NEEDED TO SECURE A 
CESSATION OF VIOLENCE FROM THE ARAB SIDE AND SET IN PLACE THE 
BEGINNINGS OF REAL PEACE TALKS LEADING TO AN END TO ISRAELI 
OCCUPATION. END SUMMARY.

3. (C) AMBASSADOR RECEIVED A CALL FROM VATICAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER EQUIVALENT ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN OCTOBER 10, 
WHO CONVEYED THE POPE\'S REQUEST THAT THE AMBASSADOR MEET THAT 
DAY WITH VISITING PATRIARCH OF JERUSALEM MICHEL SABBAH, WHO 
WAS IN ROME TO SEE THE POPE ABOUT THE DETERIORATING SITUATION 
IN THE HOLY LANDS.  MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR AND STAFF, 
SABBAH AND THE VICAR OF JERUSALEM MADE AN URGENT, ALMOST 
DESPERATE PLEA FOR UNITED STATES INTERVENTION TO STOP THE 
VIOLENCE AND END THE UNTENABLE SITUATION FOR THE PALESTINIANS 
IN THE HOLY LANDS.  HE SAID THAT THE CURFEW FORBADE THEIR 
MOVEMENT 24 HOURS PER DAY AND DEPRIVED THEM OF BASIC HUMAN 
NECESSITIES.  HE FURTHER SAID THAT BOTH THE PALESTINIAN AND 
ISRAELI PEOPLE NEEDED \"PROTECTION\" AND \"SALVATION\" IN THE 
FORM OF A U.S. OR UN MILITARY PRESENCE THAT WOULD PROVIDE 
SECURITY FOR ALL.  SABBAH ASSERTED THAT THE ARAB WORLD WAS 
READY FOR PEACE, THE PALESTINIAN WORLD WAS READY, AND THE 
TIME WAS RIGHT FOR A MOVE TO PEACE.  \"THERE IS NO REASON FOR 
THIS WAR TO GO ON,\" HE INSISTED.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT APPEARED 
TO HIM THAT THE SHARON GOVERNMENT HAD \"NO INTEREST IN PEACE.\" 
 SABBAH SAID THAT EVENTUALLY THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT WOULD 
HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE (AND RETURN 
TO THE 1967 BOUNDARIES), AND THAT SINCE PEOPLE WERE DYING 
EVERY DAY, IT WAS POINTLESS NOT TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION NOW 
AND SAVE MANY LIVES. 
 
4. (C) SABBAH SKETCHED A GRIM PICTURE OF PALESTINIAN DAILY 
LIFE UNDER SIEGE AND CURFEW, WITH SCHOOLS CLOSED, LIMITED 
MOVEMENT POSSIBLE ONLY FOR THREE HOURS THREE TIMES A WEEK, NO 
ECONOMIC LIFE, AND NO PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.  HARSH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  04991  01 OF 03  141419Z 
ISRAELI REPRESSION, SABBAH NOTED, HAS NOT RESULTED IN GREATER 
SECURITY FOR THE ISRAELI PEOPLE.  ON THE CONTRARY, \"EVEN THE 
ISRAELIS\" WERE SUFFERING, HE SAID.  WITH PALESTINIANS LIVING 
UNDER SUCH DESPERATION, SABBAH SAID IT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE 
THAT SOME WOULD RESORT TO \"IMMORAL ACTS\" LIKE SUICIDE 
BOMBING.  HE CONDEMNED TERRORIST ACTS AS \"MORALLY WRONG AND 
STRATEGICALLY WRONG,\" BUT ADDED THAT MOST PALESTINIANS CLAIM 
\"AS LONG AS THE ISRAELIS ARE IN OUR TERRITORY MAKING WAR ON 
US, WE WILL MAKE WAR ON THEM.\"  HE LAMENTED THAT PALESTINIANS 
WERE CONDEMNED FOR SUICIDE BOMBINGS, WHILE ISRAEL WAS ABLE TO 
KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND DESTROY PROPERTY BY TRADITIONAL 
MILITARY MEANS THAT EARNED LESS APPROBATION FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
ONLY THE U.S. CAN SAVE US FROM OURSELVES

5. (C) WITH THE VIOLENCE AND OCCUPATION PRESSURES 
UNRELENTING, SABBAH FEARED THAT THE SHARON GOVERNMENT WAS 
DEAF TO ANY DIALOGUE, AND THEREFORE BELIEVED THAT ONLY THE 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

BUSH ADMINISTRATION COULD GET THROUGH.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR 
POINTED OUT THAT THE GOI WAS NOT ALWAYS RESPONSIVE TO U.S. 
DEMANDS, SABBAH REPLIED: \"IF YOU CAN\'T MOVE SHARON, THEN ALL 
IS LOST FOR THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.\"  HE NOTED THAT THE ISSUE 
IS HOW MUCH PRESSURE THE U.S. WAS WILLING TO BRING TO BEAR ON 
SHARON.  IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH PRESSURE, HE FEARED THERE

ISRAELI GOVERNMENT BROUGHT IT TO AN END AND BEGAN A NEW 
DIALOGUE.  IN THE MEANTIME THOUSANDS WOULD DIE.  SABBAH 
REITERATED HIS REQUEST THAT WE CONVEY TO THE PRESIDENT HIS 
URGENT PLEA FOR AN INTERVENTION WITH SHARON TO CONVINCE HIM 
TO EASE THE SITUATION IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES AND JOIN 
IN STEPS TOWARD A LASTING CEASEFIRE.  SABBAH NOTED THAT HE 
AND THE OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS OF JERUSALEM HAD PREVIOUSLY 
REQUESTED A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND HOPED TO BE ABLE 
TO PRESENT THEIR CONCERNS DIRECTLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
AMBASSADOR PROMISED TO CONVEY SABBAH\'S COMMENTS DIRECTLY TO 
WASHINGTON. 
 
6. (C) AMBASSADOR ASKED SABBAH ABOUT THE STATUS OF HIS OWN 
EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE WITH THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. 
SABBAH SAID HE HAS MET WITH DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER MELCHIOR, 
THE ONLY GOI OFFICIAL WHO REGULARLY SPOKE WITH HIM, BUT THAT 
MELCHIOR MAKES CLEAR THAT HE CANNOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE 
GOVERNMENT, AND GENERALLY PROMISES ONLY TO CONVEY SABBAH\'S 
CONCERNS.  HE SAID HE HAS HAD A REQUEST IN TO MEET DIRECTLY 
WITH PM SHARON FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT THE PM\'S OFFICE HAS 
NOT RESPONDED.  HE BELIEVED SHARON WAS NOT INTERESTED IN 
PEACE, AND WAS BENT ON EXPELLING ALL BUT A FEW THOUSAND 
PALESTINIANS FROM THE WEST BANK IN ORDER TO CREATE A GREATER 
ISRAEL.

ALEXANDRIA GROUP: CEASEFIRE POSSIBLE WITH ISRAELI COMMITMENT

7. (C) SABBAH TOLD US THAT THE \"ALEXANDRIA GROUP\" OF 
RELIGIOUS LEADERS FROM THE MUSLIN, JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  04991  02 OF 03  141420Z 
FAITHS CREATED LAST JANUARY MAINTAINS GOOD CONTACTS WITH 
HAMAS AND THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY.  SABBAH SAID HE HAD 
ASKED HAMAS WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO STOP THE VIOLENCE AND THE 
REPLY WAS THAT AS LONG AS THE OCCUPATION CONTINUED, HAMAS WAS 
AT \"WAR\"; WHEN THE OCCUPATION CEASED, THE WAR WOULD BE OVER. 
HE SAID THAT AFTER THEY HAD SPOKEN WITH SHEIK YASSIM, HAMAS 
HAD REFRAINED FROM ATTACKS FOR OVER FOUR WEEKS.  DURING THAT 
PERIOD, HE SAID, THE ISRAELI SIDE HAD CONTINUED ITS 
OCCUPATION AND ASSASSINATION POLICY, AND SO THE TERROR 
ATTACKS WERE RENEWED. 
 
8.  (C)  PRESSED BY THE AMBASSADOR ABOUT CURRENT DIFFICULTIES 
IN ESTABLISHING AN IMPROVED SECURITY SITUATION WITHOUT 
PALESTINIAN SUICIDE ATTACKS, SABBAH INSISTED THAT THE 
ALEXANDRIA GROUP COULD USE ITS GOOD OFFICES TO OBTAIN A REAL 
CESSATION IN THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, FROM HAMAS, THE PA, AND 
POTENTIALLY EVEN HIZBOLLAH, FOR \"A MONTH.\"  BUT THEY COULD DO 
SO ONLY IF THEY HAD SOMETHING CONCRETE FROM THE ISRAELI SIDE 
TO TAKE TO THE TABLE.  AT AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY AS TO WHAT WOULD 
TYPE OF STEPS WOULD BE NEEDED FROM THE ISRAELI SIDE TO 
ACHIEVE SUCH A CESSATION OF ATTACKS, SABBAH CONCEDED THAT 
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A REAL PLEDGE FROM THE GOI TO EASE THE 
CURFEWS FOR A WEEK COULD CREATE A FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO 
BUILD, FOLLOWED BY A RETURN TO \"A MORE NORMAL LIFE.\" 
FOLLOWING UP ON SABBAH\'S INDICATION THAT THE ALEXANDRIA GROUP 
WOULD BE MEETING UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF 
CANTERBURY OCTOBER 24-25 AT LAMBETH HOUSE IN LONDON, 
AMBASSADOR URGED SABBAH TO DEVELOP HIS PROPOSAL WITHIN THE 
ALEXANDRIA GROUP.  WHILE CAUTIONING THAT IT WOULD BE A 
DIFFICULT TASK TO SET THE ALEXANDRIA GROUP OF RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS ON A POLITICAL PATH, HE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO

PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP AND REFORM 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) RESPONDING TO U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF 
POLITICAL REFORM AND RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE 
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES, SABBAH DISMISSED THESE AS \"SECONDARY 
CONCERNS.\"  \"EVEN WITH THE BEST ADMINISTRATION, FREE FROM 
CORRUPTION, VIOLENCE WILL STILL BE THERE IF NOTHING IS DONE 
ABOUT THE OCCUPATION,\" HE OBSERVED.  ON THE LEADERSHIP ISSUE, 
SABBAH CAUTIONED THAT U.S. AND ISRAELI PRESSURE TO GET RID OF 
ARAFAT WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.  \"THE MORE YOU SAY THAT 
ARAFAT IS IRRELEVANT, THE MORE RELEVANT HE BECOMES.\"  WHEREAS 
IF THE U.S. AND ISRAEL JUST IGNORED HIM AND LET THE 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF IT, \"YOU WILL GET THE 
LEADERSHIP YOU WANT,\" HE ADDED.  HE DESCRIBED ARAFAT AS 
\"PRISONER,\" WHO COULD DO NOTHING, AND TO WHOM NO ONE LISTENS, 
BUT WHO GROWS IN POPULARITY THE MORE HE IS HUMILIATED.

POPE\'S INCREASING CONCERN FOR THE SITUATION IN THE HOLY LANDS 
AND CONSISTENT OPPOSITION TO HEAVY HANDED ISRAELI REPRESSIVE 
MEASURES.  WHILE WE ARE CONFIDENT SABBAH MAINTAINS TIES TO 
BOTH HAMAS AND THE PA, AND MAY BE ABLE TO PLAY A USEFUL ROLE 
IN CONSTRAINING ATTACKS, WE LEAVE IT TO WASHINGTON, TEL AVIV 
AND JERUSALEM TO ASSESS WHETHER THESE TIES WOULD BE STRONG 
ENOUGH TO HELP ACHIEVE A CESSATION OF SUICIDE ATTACKS, AS HE 
MAINTAINS.  GIVEN THE CURRENT IMPASSE, HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE 
THAT INTER-FAITH RELIGIOUS EFFORTS SUCH AS THAT OF THE 
ALEXANDRIA GROUP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE CREATION OF SOME 
DIALOGUE IN A SITUATION WHERE VERY LITTLE EXISTS.  IN ANY 
EVENT, SABBAH\'S DESPERATE PLEA FOR GREATER U.S. ENGAGEMENT -- 
A PLEA ECHOED IN EVERY MEETING WITH SENIOR HOLY SEE OFFICIALS 
-- REFLECTS A STRONGLY HELD VIEW HERE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF 
GREATER U.S. PRESSURE ON SHARON, THERE IS NO HOPE FOR AN END 
TO THE TRAGIC CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  SABBAH, 
A PALESTINIAN NATIONALIST AND A CATHOLIC CLERGYMAN, 
UNDERSCORED TO THE AMBASSADOR HIS CONDEMNATION BOTH OF 
TERRORISM AND THE HATE SPEECH THAT EXISTS IN PALESTINIAN 
MEDIA AND SCHOOLS.  HE SAID HE PREACHES TO HIS OWN FLOCK TO 
\"LOVE THE ISRAELIS, EVEN THOSE WHO DRIVE TANKS OVER YOUR 
HOUSES.\"  THIS WAS \"HARD TO DO,\" HE ADDED, \"BUT IT IS THE 
CHRISTIAN THING TO DO.\"   ACTION REQUEST: EMBASSY IS PREPARED 
TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE HOLY SEE ON THIS TRACK IF THE 
DEPARTMENT BELIEVES IT WILL BE HELPFUL IN ENCOURAGING 
DIALOGUE AND REDUCING VIOLENCE. PLEASE ADVISE IF FOLLOWUP 
ACTION IS REQUIRED.  POST WOULD ALSO BE INTERESTED IN ANY 
READOUT OF THE LONDON MEETING OF THE ALEXANDRIA GROUP.

1.   (U) IN THE VATICAN, WHERE GESTURES AND SYMBOLS CARRY 
WEIGHT, POPE JOHN PAUL II PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS DURING 
ROMANIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH TEOCTIST\'S OCTOBER 7-13 VISIT TO 
VATICAN CITY AND THE CITY OF ROME.  IN A SERIES OF EVENTS 
CULMINATING IN A SPECIAL MASS IN ST. PETER\'S, THE PATRIARCH 
WAS ACCORDED THE HIGHEST OF HONORS PEPPERED WITH WARM 
FRATERNAL EMBRACES.  THE VISIT WAS REMARKABLY SIMILAR IN 
POMP AND PROTOCOL TO A PAPAL VISIT ABROAD, AND WAS INTENDED 
TO RECIPROCATE THE WARM RECEPTION THE POPE RECEIVED IN 
ROMANIA IN 1999.  WHILE THE POPE AND THE PATRIARCH ARE GOOD 
FRIENDS, THE HEARTY WELCOME TEOCTIST RECEIVED IS A CLEAR 
SIGN TO THE REST OF EUROPE\'S ORTHODOX COMMUNITY THAT THE 
HOLY SEE INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS VIGOROUS PURSUIT OF CLOSER 
RELIGIOUS AND GEOPOLITICAL TIES TO ORTHODOX EUROPE IN ORDER 
TO FURTHER POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S LONG-HELD VISION OF EUROPE 
EXTENDING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URAL MOUNTAINS. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------- 
ROLLING OUT THE RED CARPET 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) PATRIARCH TEOCTIST\'S \"UNOFFICIAL\" INTRODUCTION TO 
VATICAN CITY STATE BY THE POPE OCCURRED BEFORE AN AUDIENCE 
OF SOME 250,000 PILGRIMS ATTENDING THE CANONIZATION OF THE 
FOUNDER OF OPUS DEI.  THE HOLY SEE USED THE OCCASION TO 
HONOR TEOCTIST\'S STATUS AS A NATIONAL ORTHODOX LEADER -- 
THROUGHOUT HIS VISIT HE WAS SEATED ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THE 
POPE IN AN IDENTICAL CHAIR.  PATRIARCH TEOCTIST\'S SCHEDULE 
INCLUDED VISITS TO ROME\'S MAJOR BASILICAS.  IN EACH HE WAS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05138  01 OF 02  221043Z 
ACCORDED THE HIGHEST OF HONORS.  THE PATRIARCH ALSO VISITED 
THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY WHERE HE SPOKE OF CONSTRUCTING A 
CHRISTIAN EUROPE AND ON THE PERSECUTION SUFFERED BY ORTHODOX 
CHRISTIANS AT THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNISTS.  PATRIARCH 
TEOCTIST WAS GIVEN THE PULPIT DURING A MASS IN ST. PETER\'S 
BASILICA THAT MARKED THE CONCLUSION OF HIS VISIT.  IN HIS 
SERMON, HE URGED CHRISTIANS TO FILL THE VOID LEFT IN THE 
EUROPEAN PSYCHE BY SECULARIZATION AND EXPRESSED HIS 
GRATITUDE TO THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORTS TO PROMOTE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE WORLD\'S PEOPLES.

OVERCOMING DIFFERENCES:  PROPERTY AND PROSELYTISM

3. (U) IN A COMMON DECLARATION ISSUED OCTOBER 12, POPE JOHN 
PAUL AND PATRIARCH TEOCTIST CALLED FOR CLOSER RELIGIOUS TIES 
AND URGED ROMANIA\'S CHRISTIANS TO SETTLE THEIR DISPUTES 
AMICABLY.  (COMMENT: CATHOLICS IN ROMANIA ARE SEEKING 
RESTITUTION OF PROPERTIES CONFISCATED DURING THE COMMUNIST 
ERA AND HANDED OVER TO ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS. END COMMENT). 
ALSO AT ISSUE ARE CONVERSIONS TO CATHOLICISM AMONG NON- 
BELIEVERS WITH AN ORTHODOX HERITAGE.  THE ORTHODOX CHURCH 
CONSIDERS SUCH NON-BELIEVERS TO BE THEIR NATURAL 
CONSTITUENCY, WHILE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH VIEWS THEM AS OPEN 
TO CONVERSION.  THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN ROMANIA, AS IN 
RUSSIA, HAS MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT LOSING CONSTITUENTS TO 
CATHOLICISM THROUGH SUCH \"CONFESSIONAL COMPETITION.\"  THE 
TWO LEADERS EFFECTIVELY SIDE-STEPPED THIS ISSUE BY CALLING 
FOR COOPERATION RATHER THAN COMPETITION IN THEIR RESPECTIVE 
MISSIONARY WORK AMONG NON-CHRISTIANS.  THE POPE, HOWEVER, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05138  01 OF 02  221043Z 
INSISTED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SEEKS TO SUPPORT THE 
MISSION OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, WHILE BEING ABLE TO CARRY 
OUT ITS OWN PASTORAL TASK FOR ITS FAITHFUL \"AND FOR THOSE 
WHO TURN FREELY TO HER.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
COMMON CONCERNS:  EU ENLARGEMENT AND EVANGELICALS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4.   (U) THE LEADERS WERE IN FULL AGREEMENT ON THE NEED TO 
ENSURE THAT EUROPEAN UNION EXPANSION, WITH ITS SECULAR 
ORIENTATION, IS COMPLEMENTED BY RELIGIOUS VALUES AND 
INCREASING RELIGIOUS UNITY.   TO THIS END, THE POPE AND THE 
PATRIARCH AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET THEIR ISSUES ON THE 
EU\'S AGENDA.  THESE INCLUDE THE SANCTITY OF LIFE, THE 
DIGNITY AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE HUMAN PERSON, JUSTICE 
AND SOLIDARITY, PEACE AND RECONCILIATION, THE IMPORTANCE OF 
THE FAMILY, AND PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. 
 
5. (SBU) BOTH LEADERS EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER WHAT THEY

COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.   (SBU) POPE JOHN PAUL II USED HIS PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP 
WITH ROMANIAN PATRIARCH TEOCTIST, AS HE HAS PREVIOUSLY WITH 
AN ARMENIAN ORTHODOX LEADER, TO BOLSTER ECUMENICAL RELATIONS 
WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH.  IN THE FACE OF PERCEIVED RUSSIAN 
ORTHODOX INTRANSIGENCE AND INCREASING PRESSURE FROM RUSSIAN 
AUTHORITIES ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA, SUCH BRIDGE- 
BUILDING PROVIDES A USEFUL COUNTERPOINT FOR THE POPE TO 
DEMONSTRATE THE POSSIBILITIES OF CATHOLIC-ORTHODOX DIALOGUE. 
AS LONG AS THIS POPE REMAINS IN OFFICE, THIS DIALOGUE WILL 
REMAIN A PRIORITY.  IN FACT, THE POPE SUGGESTED THAT THIS 
DIALOGUE BE GIVEN AN INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE THAT WOULD 
PROVIDE FOR A MORE REGULAR ORTHODOX-CATHOLIC EXCHANGE.  THE 
HOLY SEE AND ORTHODOX CHURCHES IN GENERAL VIGOROUSLY PROMOTE 
EUROPE\'S HISTORICALLY CHRISTIAN HERITAGE IN THE CONTEXT OF 
EU EXPANSION TO FORMERLY COMMUNIST STATES.  THE WELCOME 
TEOCTIST RECEIVED IN ROME IS PART OF A BROAD VATICAN 
STRATEGY TO CEMENT ECCLESIASTICAL ALLIANCES TO MATCH THE 
SECULAR ONES CENTERED ON BRUSSELS AND STRASBOURG, AND ALSO 
TO SHOW THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX THEY HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM 
THIS POPE AND FROM CATHOLICISM.

BUT SEEKS CANONICAL DUE PROCESS 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) IN AN OCTOBER 18 LETTER TO THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF 
CATHOLIC BISHOPS, THE HOLY SEE CONVEYED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE 
U.S. BISHOPS\' EFFORTS TO ADDRESS SEXUAL ABUSE ISSUES, BUT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  05167  01 OF 02  231022Z 
ALSO INDICATED ITS DESIRE FOR REVISIONS IN THE BISHOP\'S 
ABUSE POLICY DOCUMENT ADOPTED IN DALLAS IN JUNE 2002. 
ALTHOUGH JUDGED POSITIVELY AS A WHOLE, THE DOCUMENT WAS SEEN 
BY THE VATICAN TO BE AMBIGUOUS AND CONFUSED IN SOME PARTS, 
AS WELL AS CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
(CANON LAW).  A COMMISSION OF FOUR U.S. BISHOPS AND FOUR 
VATICAN OFFICIALS WILL CONDUCT THE REVISION, EXPECTED TO BE 
COMPLETED IN TIME FOR THE U.S. BISHOPS\' NEXT MEETING IN 
NOVEMBER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
BISHOPS\' POLICY ON TRACK, BUT FINE-TUNING NEEDED 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (U) THE MUCH-ANTICIPATED VATICAN RESPONSE TO THE U.S. 
CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS\' \"NORMS FOR DIOCESAN POLICIES 
DEALING WITH ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF MINORS BY 
PRIESTS, DEACONS, OR OTHER CHURCH PERSONNEL,\" CONVEYED IN A 
LETTER FROM THE PREFECT OF THE HOLY SEE\'S CONGREGATION 
(DEPARTMENT) FOR BISHOPS, CARDINAL GIOVANNI BATTISTA RE, 
EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE BISHOPS\' EFFORTS TO RESPOND 
TO THE SEX ABUSE PROBLEM IN THE U.S.  THE HOLY SEE EXPRESSED 
\"FULL SOLIDARITY\" WITH THE U.S. BISHOPS\' CONDEMNATION OF 
SEXUAL MISDEEDS AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR EFFORTS TO \"RESPOND 
FIRMLY\" TO THE MISDEEDS OF A \"VERY SMALL NUMBER\" OF CHURCH 
PERSONNEL.  CARDINAL RE EMPHASIZED THAT THE HOLY SEE REGARDS 
SEXUAL ABUSE OF MINORS AS \"PARTICULARLY ABHORRENT.\"  AT THE 
SAME TIME, THE RE LETTER ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT THE VATICAN 
SAW POTENTIAL FOR CONFUSION AND MISINTERPRETATION IN SOME 
ASPECTS OF THE NORMS.  RE\'S LETTER IS THE FRUIT OF MONTHS OF 
INTERNAL DISCUSSION AMONG FIVE VATICAN DEPARTMENTS.  IT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05167  01 OF 02  231022Z 
REFLECTED THE UNEASE FELT HERE THAT CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF 
THE NORMS COULD VIOLATE THE DUE-PROCESS RIGHTS OF ACCUSED 
CLERGY. 
 
3.   (U) THE HOLY SEE\'S CONCERNS WITH THE U.S. NORMS ARE 
CENTERED ON THE MECHANISMS FOR ADMINISTERING THE POLICY, ITS 
COMPATIBILITY WITH CANON LAW, AND LACK OF CLARITY IN SOME 
TERMINOLOGY.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE IS CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGE TO A BISHOP\'S AUTHORITY BY SO-CALLED 
\"REVIEW BOARDS\" -- BODIES WITH A HEAVY LAY COMPONENT 
MONITORING HOW SEX ABUSE ACCUSATIONS ARE DEALT WITH -- WHICH 
ARE TO BE SET UP IN EVERY DIOCESE.  THE U.S. DOCUMENT 
DEFINES THESE AS CONSULTATIVE, HOWEVER, THE VATICAN BELIEVES 
THEY COULD SEEK TO ASSERT AUTHORITY OVER BISHOPS TO HOLD 
THEM ACCOUNTABLE.  THE HOLY SEE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT 
THE DEFINITION OF \"SEXUAL ABUSE.\"  THE \"NORMS\" DEFINE SEXUAL 
ABUSE BROADLY, INCLUDING NON-PHYSICAL ACTS.  THE VATICAN 
SEES THIS AS \"VAGUE AND IMPRECISE AND THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO 
INTERPRET.\" 
 
4. (U) AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN IS THAT THE NORMS GO FURTHER 
THAN CANON LAW AND RECENT PAPAL DIRECTIVES IN DEALING WITH 
PRIESTS CONVICTED OF SEXUAL ABUSE -- EITHER IN A CIVIL OR 
CHURCH COURT.  INSTANT DISMISSAL FROM THE CLERICAL STATE -- 
THE SO-CALLED \"ONE STRIKE AND YOU\'RE OUT\" POLICY -- DOES NOT 
CONFORM TO CHURCH LAW.  (COMMENT:  THE VATICAN ALSO MAKES A 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN ABUSE AND SEXUAL MISDEMEANOR, E.G., A 
YOUNG PRIEST HAVING A CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH A 17 YEAR- 
OLD GIRL. INDEED, FROM THE VATICAN PERSPECTIVE THE LATTER 
RELATIONSHIP IS NOT A CIVIL MISDEMEANOR IN MANY COUNTRIES 
WHERE PRIESTS WORK.  END COMMENT.)  ALTHOUGH THE U.S. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05167  01 OF 02  231022Z 
BISHOPS MAINTAIN THAT CURRENT CHURCH LAW PROCEDURES WILL BE 
RESPECTED, THE VATICAN IS SEEKING CHANGES TO SPECIFY EXACTLY 
HOW THIS WILL BE DONE. 
 
5. (U) TO ACHIEVE THESE REFINEMENTS AND PROVIDE THE VATICAN 
\"RECOGNITIO\" REQUESTED BY THE U.S. BISHOPS FOR THEIR POLICY, 
THE HOLY SEE AND THE U.S. BISHOPS HAVE CREATED A MIXED 
COMMISSION OF FOUR U.S. BISHOPS AND FOUR REPRESENTATIVES 
FROM THE HOLY SEE DICASTERIES HAVING A ROLE IN THE MATTERS 
UNDER REVIEW -- THE CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE 
FAITH, THE CONGREGATION FOR BISHOPS, THE CONGREGATION FOR 
THE CLERGY, AND THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR LEGISLATIVE 
TESTS.  THEIR REVISIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN TIME 
FOR THE NEXT U.S. BISHOPS MEETING IN NOVEMBER.  AFTER THE 
BISHOPS INCORPORATE THE CHANGES INTO THEIR\' NORMS, THE HOLY 
SEE WOULD THEN APPROVE THE REVISED DOCUMENT (PROVIDE 
\"RECOGNITIO\"), WHICH THEN AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES BINDING FOR 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES (THOUGH NOT 
ELSEWHERE).

LAST SUMMER UNDER AN INTENSE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT -- LACK THE 
PRECISION AND CLARITY NEEDED TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE POLICY 
THAT BOTH PROTECTS MINORS FROM ABUSE WHILE PROVIDING 
ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS FOR CLERGY IN THE FACE OF POTENTIAL 
FALSE ALLEGATIONS.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE VATICAN 
WANTS TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL ABUSE 
BY CLERGY, BUT DOES NOT WANT TO DO SO AT THE COST OF 
DEPRIVING CLERGY OF DUE PROCESS.  THE HOLY SEE DOES NOT AT 
THIS TIME REGARD THE U.S. BISHOPS\' EFFORT AS A MODEL FOR THE 
REST OF THE WORLD, WHERE IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES VOLUNTARY 
NORMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN AGREED WITH THE TACIT APPROVAL OF 
THE HOLY SEE.  NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE 
U.S. POLICY WILL BECOME A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR OTHER 
COUNTRIES COMING TO TERMS WITH PAST CASES OF ABUSE.  FOR 
THIS REASON, THE HOLY SEE WANTS TO BE SURE THAT THE U.S. 
NORMS ARE FULLY CONSISTENT WITH CHURCH LAW AND PROVIDE A 
LASTING BASIS TO PROTECT MINORS FROM ABUSE WHILE ENSURING 
CANONICAL DUE PROCESS FOR ACCUSED CLERGY.

WELCOME A CONTINUED STRONG PRESIDENTIAL PUSH FOR RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM IN CHINA, REINFORCING THE MESSAGE THE PRESIDENT 
DELIVERED IN HIS LAST MEETING WITH JIANG.  HOLY SEE FOREIGN 
MINISTER ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN TOLD CHARGE OCTOBER 22 
THAT THE HOLY SEE GREATLY APPRECIATED THE PRESIDENT\'S EFFORTS 
ON BEHALF OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE POSITION OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN HIS LAST MEETING, AND BELIEVES A 
REITERATION OF THE SAME POINTS AT THIS TIME WOULD BE HELPFUL. 
 AT THE SAME TIME, THE HOLY SEE IS NOT CONVINCED THAT THE 
TIMING IS PROPITIOUS TO PRESS TOO HARD FOR SPECIFIC 
CONCESSIONS FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PRIOR TO THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY CONGRESS, AS JIANG MAY BE LESS RECEPTIVE NOW THAN AFTER 
THE CONGRESS.  RATHER, THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES IT WOULD BE 
USEFUL FOR PRESIDENT BUSH TO INSIST ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR 
ALL FAITHS IN CHINA AND TO CONVEY THAT THE UNITED STATES 
WOULD WELCOME NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE HOLY 
SEE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) ACCORDING TO FM TAURAN AND VATICAN CHINA DESK OFFICER 
ROTA-GRAZIOSI, THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
IN CHINA WILL BENEFIT MOST THROUGH THE UNIVERSAL ADVANCEMENT 
OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CHINA.  THE HOLY SEE WOULD WELCOME 
THE PRESIDENT\'S AFFIRMATION OF UNITED STATES\' SUPPORT FOR 
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND CHINA AND 
FOR CHINESE GOODWILL GESTURES TOWARD THE CHURCH.  SUCH 
GESTURES COULD INCLUDE PERMISSION FOR A SENIOR HOLY SEE 
REPRESENTATIVE TO VISIT A LOCAL CHINESE CHURCH OR AN EASING 
OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE MANY BISHOPS AND PRIESTS BEING 
HELD IN POLICE CUSTODY, HOUSE ARREST OR UNDER HEAVY 
SURVEILLANCE.  OVER THE LONGER TERM, THE HOLY SEE WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE CHINESE AUTHORITIES PERMIT THE ORDINATION OF CHINESE

3.  (C) THE KEY TO SINO-VATICAN RELATIONS AT THIS JUNCTURE, 
THEY BELIEVE, IS FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO BETTER 
UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE SPECIFIC LINK BETWEEN CATHOLICS 
AND THE HOLY SEE.  ACCORDING TO ROTA-GRAZIOZI, THE CHINESE 
REMAIN GRIPPED WITH FEAR THAT CATHOLIC CHURCH MEMBERSHIP 
WOULD THREATEN CHINESE CIVIL POWER.  HE BELIEVED SUCH FEARS 
COULD BE ALLAYED IF THE CHINESE BETTER UNDERSTOOD THAT 
CATHOLIC FAITHFUL DO NOT ALWAYS FOLLOW THE HOLY SEE\'S 
POSITIONS ON INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL ISSUES AND THAT PAPAL 
AUTHORITY IS A SPIRITUAL, NOT POLITICAL, MATTER.

THE DIRECTOR OF CARITAS\' BRITISH OFFICE (CAFOD) HAS RETURNED 
FROM A FIVE-DAY VISIT TO IRAQ TO ASSESS IRAQ\'S CAPACITY TO 
RESPOND TO POTENTIAL HUMANITARIAN NEEDS IN THE WAKE OF 
MILITARY ACTION.  CARITAS PREDICTED THAT MILITARY ACTION 
WOULD CAUSE A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE, AFFECTING CHILDREN 
THE MOST, AND URGED THAT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE BE DONE TO 
AVOID WAR.  CARITAS\' ACCESS TO IRAQ WAS DEPENDENT IN PART ON 
PROVIDING ADVOCACY REGARDING CURRENT PROBLEMS ATTRIBUTED TO 
U.N. SANCTIONS.  THEY ARE EXPECTED TO RELEASE AN OFFICIAL 
STATEMENT SHORTLY THAT WILL IN TURN HELP SHAPE THE HOLY 
SEE\'S OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE HUMANITARIAN CONSEQUENCES OF 
WAR.  CI HAS CALLED A MEETING AT ITS VATICAN HEADQUARTERS 
DECEMBER 17-18 TO DISCUSS ITS OFFICIAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
STRATEGY IN THE EVENT OF WAR IN IRAQ.  END SUMMARY.

ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF WAR AND SANCTIONS

2. A CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS DELEGATION LED BY CARITAS\' 
BRITISH OFFICE HEAD, AND INCLUDING CI\'S GLOBAL ISSUES DESK 
OFFICER, IRAQ OFFICE DIRECTOR (BASED IN AMMAN, JORDAN), AND 
MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA OFFICE DIRECTOR FROM BEIRUT MET 
WITH CHURCH OFFICIALS, IRAQI DEPUTY PM TARIQ AZIZ AND OTHER 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DURING A RECENT VISIT TO IRAQ TO ASSES 
THE IMPLICATIONS OF MILITARY ACTION AND CURRENT SANCTIONS. 
CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS IS A 154-MEMBER FEDERATION OF 
CATHOLIC RELIEF AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES OPERATIVE IN 198 
COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES, HEADQUARTERED IN VATICAN CITY BUT 
INDEPENDENT FROM THE HOLY SEE. ITS VATICAN CITY OFFICE 
PROVIDES A FORUM FOR EXCHANGE AND DIALOGUE AMONG MEMBER

AGENCIES AND ADVOCACY SERVICES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
2. (SBU) CI TOLD US \"OFF THE RECORD\" THAT ENTRY TO IRAQ WAS 
CONDITIONAL ON CARITAS SUBSEQUENTLY ACTING AS AN ADVOCATE 
FOR THE IRAQI CAUSE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA.  THE IRAQIS 
DID NOT WANT CI CONDUCTING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY 
ASSESSMENT THEY HAD ORIGINALLY INTENDED.  HOWEVER, CI 
BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GAIN ACCESS TO IRAQ AND SO TOOK 
THE MIDDLE ROAD BY PROMISING ADVOCACY ASSISTANCE WHILE 
CHECKING IRAQ\'S PREPAREDNESS FOR ANY MILITARY ACTIVITY THAT 
MIGHT RESULT IN A FURTHER HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY. DURING THE 
VISIT, THE DELEGATION WAS PERMITTED TO BRING IN A 
PHOTOGRAPHER -- WHOSE ACTIVITIES WERE CLOSELY MONITORED. 
THE GROUP ENCOUNTERED SOME IRAQI OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE 
OF THE CI OFFICIALS FROM AMMAN AND BEIRUT BECAUSE THEY SPOKE 
ARABIC -- DISPENSING WITH THE NEED FOR AN OFFICIAL 
GOVERNMENT INTERPRETER. 
 
3. (SBU) IN AN UNOFFICIAL INITIAL ASSESSMENT RELEASED TO 
POST, THE CI DELEGATION REPORTED THAT WOMAN AND CHILDREN 
WERE IN \"BAD CONDITION\" CLAIMING ONE IN THREE CHILDREN IS 
MALNOURISHED.  CARITAS MAINTAINS THAT SANCTIONS ARE TO BLAME 
FOR 75 PERCENT OF THE IRAQI POPULATION EXPERIENCING \"POOR 
LIVING CONDITIONS\" WITH THE AVERAGE INCOME BETWEEN $3 AND $5 
PER DAY -- \"NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR BASIC NECESSITIES.\"  CI 
CLAIMED THAT WATER ACCESS AND SECURITY HAS DETERIORATED OVER 
THE LAST 10 YEARS, QUOTING UN FIGURES THAT ONLY 43 PERCENT 
OF THE RURAL POPULATION HAS DIRECT ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER. 
CI\'S ASSESSMENT WILL SUGGEST THAT A MILITARY STRIKE ON IRAQ 
WOULD CAUSE \"TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS,\" WITH CHILDREN BEING THE 
MOST AFFECTED.  PREVIOUS CARITAS DELEGATIONS TO IRAQ HAVE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05296  01 OF 02  291503Z 
MADE SIMILAR ASSESSMENTS. 
 
4. (U) CI INSISTS THAT EVERYTHING MUST BE DONE TO PREPARE 
FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF A MILITARY STRIKE, BUT THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY \"MUST ALSO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO 
AVOID WAR.\" CI CLAIMS MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ WOULD 
CAUSE A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE WITH SEVERE CONSEQUENCES 
FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  FOLLOWING UP ON THE VISIT, CI 
HAS CALLED A MEETING AT ITS VATICAN CITY HEADQUARTERS FOR 
DECEMBER 17 AND 18 TO DISCUSS ITS OFFICIAL EMERGENCY 
RESPONSE STRATEGY FOR IRAQ.

COMMENT

5. (SBU) CI\'S OFFICIAL STATEMENT ON ITS DELEGATION\'S VISIT 
TO IRAQ WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY.  THIS STATEMENT IN TURN 
WILL BE USED BY THE HOLY SEE IN DEVELOPING ITS OWN 
ASSESSMENT OF THE MORAL AND HUMANITARIAN CONSEQUENCES OF 
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ.  CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS WILL 
BE A KEY PLAYER IN ANY EVENTUAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO

IRAQ.  CI\'S CRITICAL VIEWS ON SANCTIONS DERIVE IN PART FROM 
POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S BROADLY STATED POSITION THAT SANCTIONS 
GENERALLY ARE WRONG BECAUSE THEY IMPACT MOST ON THE 
VULNERABLE AND WEAK.  EMBASSY WILL ENGAGE WITH CI DIRECTLY 
TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SANCTIONS RESTS

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON.  REASON:  1.5 (B). 
 
1. (U) EMBASSY APPROACHED HOLY SEE DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
MIGLIORE OCTOBER 25 TO REQUEST HOLY SEE DEMARCHES TO 
ORGANIZATION OF ISLAMIC CONFERENCE (OIC) MEMBER STATES IN 
ORDER TO SECURE BROADER SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.-SPONSORED 
RESOLUTION BANNING ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING.  MIGLIORE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  05346  311458Z 
INDICATED HE WOULD CONSIDER THE U.S. PROPOSAL AND REQUESTED 
DCM REVIEW ISSUE WITH HIM OCTOBER 29.  AT THAT MEETING, DCM 
REITERATED THE U.S. VIEW THAT THE HOLY SEE MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
REINFORCE OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD SUPPORT AMONG OIC COUNTRIES. 
DCM NOTED THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S BELIEF THAT HUMAN CLONING 
REPRESENTS AN ASSAULT ON HUMAN DIGNITY WOULD RESONATE WITH 
OIC COUNTRIES. 
 
2. (SBU) MIGLIORE RESPONDED THAT THE HOLY SEE STRONGLY 
SUPPORTED A COMPLETE BAN, AND WAS WORKING ACTIVELY TO ACHIEVE 
IT.  HE INDICATED THAT THEY WERE LOBBYING ACTIVELY IN LATIN 
AMERICA, AFRICA, AND EUROPE, AS WE HAD URGED IN AN EARLIER 
APPROACH.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE CAUTIONED THAT THE HOLY SEE 
CONTINUED TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN TO ALTERNATIVES SHORT OF A 
TOTAL BAN, AS LONG AS THEY RESPECTED MORAL PRINCIPLES.  HE 
EMPHASIZED, AS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY (REF B), THAT THE HOLY SEE 
DID NOT WANT TO BE LEFT WITH NOTHING IN THE EVENT A TOTAL BAN 
COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED. 
 
3. (C) REGARDING THE U.S. REQUEST FOR THE HOLY SEE TO 
APPROACH OIC COUNTRIES, MIGLIORE SAID THE HOLY SEE BELIEVED 
THAT THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN 
BUILDING SUPPORT AMONG OIC COUNTRIES.  \"WE CANNOT CREATE 
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A HOLY ALLIANCE,\" HE ASSERTED.  DCM 
NOTED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD WORKED EFFECTIVELY WITH OIC 
COUNTRIES IN 1994 AT THE UN POPULATION CONFERENCE IN CAIRO, 
AND THAT WE BELIEVED SIMILAR MORAL ISSUES WERE AT STAKE IN 
THIS CASE.  MIGLIORE INSISTED THAT THIS CASE WAS DIFFERENT 
THAN 1994 BECAUSE AT THAT TIME THERE HAD BEEN TREMENDOUS TIME 
PRESSURE.  IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS MORE TIME AND THERE WERE 
BETTER OPTIONS ON THE TABLE.  PRESSED FURTHER, MIGLIORE SAID 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05346  311458Z 
THE HOLY SEE HAD TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT ITS INTERNATIONAL IMAGE. 
 \"WE DON\'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT OUR VIEWS AND 
THOSE OF THE MUSLIM WORLD ARE ONE AND THE SAME.\" 
 
4. (C) REGARDING THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY, MIGLIORE 
ELABORATED ON THE HOLY SEE\'S PERSPECTIVE AND STRATEGY LEADING 
UP TO WHAT THEY UNDERSTOOD WOULD BE A FEBRUARY VOTE ON THE 
RESOLUTION.  INITIALLY, THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO LOBBY HARD FOR 
A TOTAL BAN.  IF IT APPEARED THAT THE VOTES FOR SUCH A BAN 
WOULD NOT BE THERE, THEY WOULD CONSIDER SUPPORTING A MODIFIED 
FRENCH/GERMAN TEXT THAT RESPECTED MORAL PRINCIPLES.  SUCH A 
TEXT: 1) MUST NOT CLOSE THE MANDATE OF THE COMMITTEE, WHICH 
MUST BE ABLE TO REOPEN AND BROADEN; 2) MUST INCLUDE WORDING 
TO MAKE CLEAR THAT AGREEMENT ON THE PARTIAL BAN DOES NOT 
IMPLY APPROVAL OF THERAPEUTIC CLONING. 
 
5. (C) MIGLIORE SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS CONCERNED THAT AN 
INCREASING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, INCLUDING JAPAN, CHINA, 
SINGAPORE, AND THE UK WERE ALREADY USING THERAPEUTIC CLONING, 
AND THAT THIS WAS BECOMING A REALITY THAT WOULD BE HARD TO 
PUT BACK IN THE BOTTLE.  HE EXPECTED THAT THESE COUNTRIES 
WOULD STRONGLY RESIST EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A TOTAL BAN.

AT THE UNITED NATIONS IN NEW YORK.  MIGLIORE REPLACES 
ARCHBISHOP RENATO MARTINO WHO RETURNS TO ROME TO TAKE UP A 
SENIOR CURIA POSITION.  MIGLIORE WILL BE ORDAINED AS AN 
ARCHBISHOP BEFORE TAKING UP HIS POSTING TO NEW YORK. 
 
2.   (U) CELESTINO MIGLIORE WAS BORN IN CUNEO, IN PIEDMONT 
PROVINCE, IN THE NORTH OF ITALY IN 1950.  AFTER HIS 
ORDINATION AS A CATHOLIC PRIEST HE TOOK UP GRADUATE STUDIES 
IN CANON LAW AND DIPLOMACY AND ENTERED THE HOLY SEE\'S 
DIPLOMATIC SERVICE IN 1980.  MIGLIORE SERVED AT HOLY SEE 
NUNCIATURES IN ANGOLA, THE U.S., EGYPT, AND POLAND. IN 1992 
HE WAS APPOINTED AS THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER TO THE 
COUNCIL OF EUROPE IN STRASBOURG.  HE RETURNED TO ROME IN 
1995 UPON HIS APPOINTMENT AS UNDERSECRETARY OF THE SECTION 
FOR RELATIONS WITH STATES (AT THE VATICAN\'S SECRETARIAT OF 
STARE. HE SPEAKS ITALIAN, ENGLISH, FRENCH, SPANISH AND 
PORTUGUESE. 
 
3.   (SBU) MIGLIORE HAS BEEN ONE OF POST\'S MOST OPEN, 
ARTICULATE, AND FRIENDLY INTERLOCUTORS.  MORE SO THAN MANY 
OTHER VATICAN OFFICIALS, HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO ACT TO 
RESOLVE PROBLEMS OR ADVANCE POLICY, SOMETIMES DEFYING THE 
HOLY SEE\'S TRADITIONAL CAUTION.  HE WAS, FOR EXAMPLE, 
INSTANTLY AND POSITIVELY DISPOSED TO WORKING WITH POST AND 
OTHER DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS TO ORGANIZE AND HOST AN 
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS WHEN 
OTHERS IN THE HOLY SEE WERE MORE HESITANT.  THIS \"CAN DO\" 
ATTITUDE SHOULD STAND HIM WELL IN HIS UPCOMING 
RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE U.N.  THIS IS NOT TO SAY, HOWEVER, 
THAT MIGLIORE THINKS LIKE AN AMERICAN.  HE IS ITALIAN, AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05404  060634Z 
SEES THE WORLD THROUGH A EUROPEAN FILTER, WHICH HAS LED HIM 
AT TIMES TO BE CRITICAL OF OR SKEPTICAL TOWARD ASPECTS OF 
U.S. POLICIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN AN EARLY OCTOBER 2001 
DISCUSSION WITH POLOFF ABOUT THE U.S. RESPONSE TO THE 
ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, MIGLIORE POINTEDLY NOTED THAT 
\"AFTER ALL, BIN LADEN IS A U.S. CREATION\" (NOTE: REFERRING 
TO U.S. ASSISTANCE TO ISLAMIC MUJAHADIN IN AFGHANISTAN IN 
THE 1980\'S.)  LIKEWISE, IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT BIOTECH FOODS, 
HE HAS ASSERTED THE VIEW THAT U.S. POLICY IN ZAMBIA IS 
DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC, RATHER THAN HUMANITARIAN, INTERESTS. 
 
4. (SBU) MIGLIORE\'S VIEWS ON IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST ARE 
REPORTED IN DETAIL IN REFTELS.  MIGLIORE HAS MADE CLEAR THAT 
HE IS \"NO FAN OF IRAQ,\" BUT DOES NOT YET BELIEVE THE U.S. 
HAS YET MADE THE CASE FOR PREEMPTIVE MILITARY ACTION. 
 
5. (SBU)  MIGLIORE, AS DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER EQUIVALENT AT 
THE VATICAN, NECESSARILY COVERED A GLOBAL RANGE OF FOREIGN 
POLICY ISSUES.  WHETHER BY CHOICE OR CIRCUMSTANCE, IN THE 
LAST YEAR HE HAS TAKEN A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN A FEW AREAS: 
THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN NORTH KOREA (HE HAS TRAVELED 
THERE FIVE TIMES IN RECENT YEARS), THE CHURCH\'S POSITION IN 
RUSSIA WHERE HE RECENTLY TRAVELED TO DISCUSS GOR\'S REFUSAL 
OF VISAS TO CATHOLIC CLERGY, AND THE CHURCH\'S DIFFICULT 
RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM.  ALL IN ALL, MIGLIORE CAN BE COUNTED 
ON TO BE AN OPEN, SOMETIMES UNVARNISHED, BUT ALSO CAREFUL 
AND DELIBERATE INTERLOCUTOR AT THE U.N.  HE CERTAINLY ENJOYS 
THE CONFIDENCE OF FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN AND THE POPE 
HIMSELF. 
 
6.  (U)  ARCHBISHOP-DESIGNATE MIGLIORE WILL STEP INTO THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05404  060634Z 
SHOES OF THE ABLE RENATO MARTINO, THE VATICAN\'S 
REPRESENTATIVE AT THE U.N. FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS. IT WAS 
MARTINO\'S LEADERSHIP THAT STEERED THE HOLY SEE DELEGATIONS 
TO SELF-PROCLAIMED SUCCESS AT U.N. CONFERENCES IN RIO DE 
JANEIRO IN 1992, CAIRO IN 1994, BEIJING IN 1995 AND THE MORE 
RECENT 2002 CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN 
JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. MARTINO\'S 40 YEARS IN THE 
SERVICE OF VATICAN DIPLOMACY, IN PLACES AS FAR APART AS 
SINGAPORE AND LEBANON, PROVIDED HIM WITH A UNIQUE 
PREPARATION FOR HIS TIME AT THE U.N.  MARTINO WAS CONSTANTLY 
IN THE NEWS, BOTH SECULAR AND ECCLESIASTICAL. HE ALSO SPENT 
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME PROMOTING THE HOLY SEE\'S DIPLOMATIC 
INITIATIVES AT THE U.N. DURING VISITS ABROAD. IN FACT, 
ARCHBISHOP MARTINO\'S EFFORTS HAVE TURNED THE PERMANENT 
OBSERVER POST INTO A KEY VENUE FOR THE HOLY SEE TO PROJECT 
ITS MESSAGE.  MIGLIORE INHERITS THE PRESTIGE, BUT ALSO THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE POST.  THE FACT THAT POPE JOHN PAUL 
CHOSE MIGLIORE TO BE THE HOLY SEE\' PERMANENT OBSERVER AT THE 
U.N. SHOWS THE HOLY SEE WANTS ITS BEST DIPLOMATIC HAND 
PLAYED AT THIS KEY INTERNATIONAL TABLE.

PICTURE OF A DEFENSIVE CUBAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN A NOVEMBER 6 
MEETING WITH POLOFFS TO DISCUSS CUBA AND VENEZUELA (VENEZUELA 
REPORTED SEPTEL).  MSGR. GIORGIO LINGUA SAID THE HOLY SEE AND 
CUBAN CHURCH HAVE DECIDED NOT TO ENGAGE IN OVERTLY POLITICAL 
SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATIC DISSIDENTS IN CUBA IN ORDER TO AVOID A 
CRACKDOWN ON THE CHURCH BY THE GOC.  HE NOTED THAT THE ONE 
CHURCH-RELATED PUBLICATION THAT ENGAGES IN POLITICAL 
COMMENTARY, \"VITRAL,\" HAS CAUSED THE HOLY SEE SOME DIFFICULTY 
WITH CUBAN AUTHORITIES, ADDING THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD 
ENCOURAGED THE BISHOP RESPONSIBLE FOR IT TO RESPOND

DESPITE THE BISHOP\'S FEARS OF CENSORSHIP.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
A CHURCH PLAYING DEFENSE 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) FOLLOWING UP ON RECENT USINT REPORTING ON CATHOLIC 
CHURCH ACTIVITIES IN CUBA (REFTELS), POLOFFS CALLED ON 
VATICAN COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR THE CARIBBEAN STATES, MSGR. 
GIORGIO LINGUA, NOVEMBER 6 TO DISCUSS THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS OF 
THE STATE OF THE CHURCH AND DEMOCRATIC DISSIDENCE IN CUBA. 
WE ASKED WHETHER THE PAPAL NUNCIO HAS DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINS 
CONTACTS WITH THE DISSIDENT COMMUNITY AND WHETHER THE HOLY 
SEE WOULD TAKE A POSITION ON A CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION. 
 LINGUA RESPONDED THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY INTENTION OF 
THE HOLY SEE TO ENGAGE ON THE HR RESOLUTION, EVEN BEHIND THE 
SCENES.  FURTHERMORE, HE SAID THE HOLY SEE SUPPORTS THE CUBAN 
CHURCH\'S CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO POLITICAL ACTIVITIES, AND WAS 
NOT AWARE OF ANY PLANNED OUTREACH TO CUBA\'S DISSIDENT 
COMMUNITY BY THE NUNCIO.  HE INDICATED THAT THE CHURCH (AND 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05471  01 OF 02  080949Z 
THE HOLY SEE) PHILOSOPHICALLY SUPPORTED GREATER POLITICAL 
FREEDOMS IN CUBA.  HOWEVER, HE PAINTED A PICTURE OF A CHURCH 
IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DEFENSIVE POSTURE. ITS OVERRIDING CONCERN 
WAS TO MAINTAIN THE ABILITY OF THE FAITHFUL TO PRACTICE THEIR 
FAITH AND TO AVOID A CRACKDOWN BY THE GOC ON THE CHURCH\'S OWN 
LIMITED FREEDOM. 
 
3. (C)  AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS CAUTION, LINGUA POINTED TO THE 
FACT THAT ALMOST ALL CHURCH PUBLICATIONS IN CUBA AVOID 
EXPLICITLY POLITICAL COMMENTARY.  HE SAID THE ONLY EXCEPTION 
IS THE PUBLICATION OF THE PINAR DEL RIO DIOCESE\'S NEWSLETTER 
\"VITRAL,\" WHOSE EDITOR, DAGOBERTO VALDEZ, WAS A RELATIVELY 
OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF THE GOC.  LINGUA TOLD US THAT THE HOLY 
SEE HAD RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT VITRAL FROM THE 
CUBAN EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE.  IN RESPONSE, THE HOLY SEE HAS 
ALWAYS UNDERSCORED THE PAPER\'S RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION.  ON THE OTHER HAND, HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD 
URGED THE BISHOP OF PINAR DEL RIO TO \"REGISTER\" THE PAPER 
WITH CUBAN AUTHORITIES AS THE LATTER HAVE BEEN DEMANDING. 
THE HOLY SEE THOUGHT IT NORMAL FOR REVENUE GENERATING 
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VITRAL TO HAVE TO REGISTER WITH CIVIL 
AUTHORITIES.  BUT, ACCORDING TO LINGUA, THE BISHOP FEARED 
CENSORSHIP AND HAD SO FAR REFUSED TO REGISTER THE PAPER. 
 
4.  (C)  QUERIED AS TO WHY THE CHURCH IN CUBA, AN 
HISTORICALLY CATHOLIC COUNTRY, WASN\'T AS ACTIVE IN THE FIGHT 
FOR FREEDOM AS HAD BEEN THE POLISH CHURCH, LINGUA NOTED THAT 
THE CHURCH HAD ALWAYS CHARTED A CAUTIOUS COURSE IN CUBA, YET 
IT WAS NEVER SUPPRESSED IN THE SAME MANNER AS HAD BEEN THE 
CASE IN MANY COUNTRIES OF EASTERN EUROPE.  CATHOLIC CLERGY, 
EVEN BISHOPS, WERE ALL CUBANS, NOT FOREIGN, AND HAD RETAINED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05471  01 OF 02  080949Z 
THE RIGHT TO PRACTICE AND PROMOTE THEIR FAITH.  THEY HAD NOT 
BEEN THROWN INTO A GULAG, AS HAD BEEN THE CASE IN EASTERN 
EUROPE, AND THUS DID NOT FEEL AS THREATENED BY \"OLD FASHIONED 
SOCIALISM\" AS THEIR EASTERN EUROPEAN BRETHREN. NEVERTHELESS, 
LINGUA RECOGNIZED THAT THE CHURCH WAS CONSTRAINED, AS IT

EXPECT THE HOLY SEE (IF NOT ALL OF ITS BISHOPS) WILL REMAIN 
DISCRETE IN DEALINGS WITH CUBA\'S DISSIDENT COMMUNITY, WHILE 
PATIENTLY SEEKING TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND SPACE FOR RELIGIOUS 
ACTIVITIES.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE HOLY SEE TO 
ENGAGE MORE DIRECTLY WITH DISSIDENTS AND RAISE ITS VOICE AS 
THE POPE DID IN 1998 FOR BROADER HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA.

1. (C) POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS SPOKEN OUT FORCEFULLY AND 
CONSISTENTLY AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE AND AGAINST 
SPECIFIC ANTI-SEMITIC ACTS.  HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH\'S SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM -- IN 
PART BASED ON THE CHURCH\'S SELF-ACKNOWLEDGED HISTORICAL 
&SIN8 OF PROMOTING ANTI-JUDAISM (RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION) 
IN EUROPE. THROUGHOUT HIS PONTIFICATE, THE POPE HAS SOUGHT TO 
TURN THIS AWARENESS OF PAST ERRORS INTO A RESOLVE TO OVERCOME 
THIS HISTORICAL ANTI-JUDAISM AND TO COMBAT EUROPEAN 
ANTI-SEMITISM (ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION).  TO THIS END, THE POPE 
HAS RADICALLY TRANSFORMED THE HOLY SEE\'S RELATIONS WITH JEWS, 
REDEFINING THE JEWISH RELIGION AS INTRINSIC TO CHRISTIANITY 
AND PART OF A COMMON HERITAGE, WHILE ACTIVELY DEEPENING THE 
CHURCH\'S DIALOGUE WITH JEWS.  BUILDING ON THE SECOND VATICAN 
COUNCIL\'S REAPPRAISAL OF CATHOLICISM\'S RELATIONSHIP TO 
JUDAISM, THE HOLY SEE HAS TAKEN SYSTEMIC MEASURES TO ADDRESS 
ITS ROLE IN HISTORICAL ANTI-SEMITISM AND TO CHANGE ITS 
PRACTICE.  ASIDE FROM PUBLIC AND DOCTRINAL STATEMENTS, IT 
ACTIVELY PROMOTES AN AWARENESS OF THE ERROR OF ANTI-JUDAISM 
AND ANTI-SEMITISM IN ITS MANY CATHOLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS. 
THESE TENETS ARE ALSO PROMOTED BY BISHOPS\' CONFERENCES IN 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ARE PREACHED REGULARLY THROUGHOUT THE 
CONTINENT.  CATHOLIC LAY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE 
SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY ENGAGE IN FREQUENT DIALOGUE AND 
EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH, WITH THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE HOLY SEE.

2. (U) JOHN PAUL II\'S EFFORTS TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM STEM IN 
PART FROM HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCES GROWING UP IN A TOWN WITH 
A LARGE JEWISH POPULATION, DEFENDING JEWISH FRIENDS FROM 
ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACKS, AND WITNESSING HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN 
AND WOMEN BEING SHIPPED TO NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMPS.  FROM 
THE POPE\'S EARLY STUDIES HE CAME TO THE VIEW THAT 
ANTI-SEMITES WERE ANTI-CHRISTIAN.  SUBSEQUENTLY, HE DEVELOPED 
A STRONG PERSONAL CONVICTION OF THE INHERENT DIGNITY OF ALL 
HUMAN BEINGS; AND THREATS TO THIS DIGNITY HAVE ALMOST BECOME 
PERSONAL \"CAUSES\" FOR THIS POPE.  THE POPE HAS ASSERTED THAT 
THE CHURCH MUST ATONE FOR THE HISTORICAL EXISTENCE OF 
ANTI-JUDAISM IN CHRISTIAN EUROPE THAT AT LEAST IN PART 
CREATED A FOUNDATION FOR THE RACIAL ANTI-SEMITISM OF THE 
TWENTIETH CENTURY. 
 
3. (U) IT IS THEREFORE NO COINCIDENCE THAT UNDER JOHN PAUL II 
THE VATICAN HAS UNDERTAKEN NUMEROUS SYMBOLIC AND PRACTICAL 
STEPS TO BUILD ON VATICAN II REFORMS AND REACH OUT TO JEWS -- 
MOST DRAMATICALLY WHEN THE POPE VISITED ROME\'S SYNAGOGUE IN 
1986, AND JERUSALEM\'S WAILING WALL IN 2000.  IN FACT, WHEN 
POPE JOHN PAUL II STEPPED INTO ROME\'S SYNAGOGUE IN APRIL 
1986, HE WAS THE FIRST POPE IN 1,900 YEARS TO TAKE THAT STEP. 
 THROUGHOUT HIS PONTIFICATE, HE HAS MERGED SUCH DRAMATIC, 
SYMBOLIC STEPS, SUCH AS HIS VISIT TO AUSCHWITZ IN POLAND, 
WITH A NEW CONCEPTUAL APPROACH TO CATHOLIC-JEWISH RELATIONS 
EMBODIED IN AN ARRAY OF STATEMENTS AND EXHORTATIONS.  THESE 
STATEMENTS, WHICH BEGAN WITH THE SECOND VATICAN COUNCIL\'S 
NOSTRA AETATE IN 1965 AND INCLUDE \"WE REMEMBER:  A REFLECTION 
ON THE SHOAH,\" HAVE EMPHASIZED THE CHURCH\'S REJECTION OF ALL 
FORMS OF PERSECUTION, ITS SHARED SPIRITUAL HERITAGE WITH 
JUDAISM, AND A RECOGNITION OF AND REPENTANCE FOR PAST ERRORS.

WHAT THE HOLY SEE IS DOING 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (U) THE CHURCH HAS ORGANIZED ITSELF SINCE VATICAN II TO 
ENGAGE IN AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH OTHER FAITHS, INCLUDING THE 
ORTHODOX, BUT IN PARTICULAR, WITH THE JEWISH FAITH. 
REFLECTING THE POPE\'S COMMITMENT, HE HAS PUT SOME OF HIS BEST 
PEOPLE ON THIS TASK.  GERMAN CARDINAL WALTER KASPER, ONE OF 
THE VATICAN\'S MOST OPEN AND PERCEPTIVE INTERLOCUTORS, FOR 
EXAMPLE, HEADS THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR CHRISTIAN UNITY, 
WHICH INCLUDES RESPONSIBILITY FOR DIALOGUE WITH JEWS, AND IS 
CHARGED WITH FOSTERING A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH 
RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS.   KASPER SAID OCTOBER 18, IN REFERENCE 
TO OPENING THE HOLOCAUST-ERA VATICAN ARCHIVES, THAT THE 
CHURCH SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO CONFRONT ITS PAST.  MORE 
RECENTLY, ON NOVEMBER 6 HE OFFERED A THREE-POINT ACTION PLAN 
FOR THE ON-GOING FIGHT AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM FOCUSING ON 
REVISING RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL TEXTS, INCREASING PERSONAL 
ENCOUNTERS WITH JEWISH PEOPLE, AND STUDYING JEWISH HISTORY.

5.    (U) BEYOND KASPER\'S DIALOGUE, THE HOLY SEE IS HIGHLY 
ATTUNED TO ANY INCIDENT THAT MIGHT SMACK OF RESURGENT 
ANTI-SEMITISM.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE POPE QUICKLY SENT A MESSAGE 
WHEN IT SEEMED JEWISH GRAVES IN ROME\'S VERANO CEMETERY HAD 
BEEN DESECRATED EARLIER THIS YEAR (REF A).  THE POPE\'S 
LEADERSHIP IN THIS REGARD IS REFLECTED IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF 
THE EUROPEAN CATHOLIC BISHOPS\' CONFERENCES, WHICH HAVE EITHER 
ISSUED DOCUMENTS OR MADE STATEMENTS IN THE MEDIA CONDEMNING 
ANTI-SEMITISM GENERALLY AND SPECIFIC ANTI-SEMITIC ACTS. 
EUROPEAN BISHOPS CONFERENCES WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

AGAINST ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACKS, AS THE FRENCH BISHOPS DID WHEN 
SYNAGOGUES IN FRANCE WERE DESECRATED IN APRIL THIS YEAR. 
 
6.    (U) AT THE OSCE, VATICAN FOREIGN POLICY ACTIVELY 
SUPPORTS AND PROMOTES RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND TOLERANCE IN 
EUROPE.  WHILE DEFENDING ITS OWN INTERESTS AND POSITION, IT 
EMBRACES THE CAUSES OF ALL OTHER RELIGIONS FOR MUTUAL 
BENEFIT.  THE HOLY SEE\'S REPRESENTATIVE IS WORKING WITH US TO 
ENSURE RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION OR ANTI-SEMITISM ARE 
CONDEMNED BY THE OSCE, AND THAT THE ORGANIZATION PUTS 
PRESSURE ON OFFENDING GOVERNMENTS TO AMEND LEGISLATION AND 
PRACTICES. 
 
7.    (U) THE RECENT ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INSTITUTE FOR 
INTER-RELIGIOUS STUDIES AT THE PONTIFICAL GREGORIAN 
UNIVERSITY AND THE OPENING OF THE LIBRARY FOR STUDIES IN 
JUDAISM RUN BY THE SISTERS OF SION REFLECTS THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH\'S CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING OF 
NON-CHRISTIAN RELIGIONS, ESPECIALLY JUDAISM.  WE EXPECT MORE 
CATHOLIC INSTITUTES OF HIGHER LEARNING TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMS 
TO STUDY JUDAISM IN THE YEARS AHEAD.  EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS 
WILL CONTINUE TO BE A KEY COMPONENT OF THE HOLY SEE\'S EFFORTS 
TO COUNTER ANTI-SEMITISM.  IN 1985, THE HOLY SEE RELEASED 
\"NOTES ON THE CORRECT WAY TO PRESENT THE JEWS AND JUDAISM IN 
PREACHING AND CATECHESIS,\" A PRIMER DESIGNED TO PUT AN 
DEFINITIVE END TO TEACHING OF JEWISH CULPABILITY IN CHRIST\'S 
DEATH.  CENTURIES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WILL NEVERTHELESS TAKE 
TIME TO CORRECT, BUT THE HOLY SEE\'S EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS ARE 
CONTRIBUTING TO THAT PROCESS.

THEM, ROME\'S SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY (WHICH FOCUSES ON RELIEF 
AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION AROUND THE WORLD) HAS MAINTAINED A 
TWENTY-YEAR DIALOGUE WITH JUDAISM.  ON THE OCTOBER 16 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPORTATION OF ROME\'S JEWS TO NAZI 
EXTERMINATION CAMPS, SANT\'EGIDIO FOUNDER ANDREA RICCARDI 
EMPHASIZED THAT JEWS ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ROME\'S 
IDENTITY.  RICCARDI WARNED THAT \"NEW WINDS OF ANTI-SEMITISM\" 
WERE BLOWING INTO EUROPE, AND SAID IT WAS KEY TO STAND IN 
SOLIDARITY WITH THE JEWS AND NEVER AGAIN TO ABANDON THEM. 
RICCARDI, A RESPECTED HISTORIAN, MENTIONED A NUMBER OF 
ANTI-SEMITIC INCIDENTS THAT HAVE PEPPERED ROME\'S RECENT PAST. 
 RICCARDI ALSO REPRESENTED THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY AT A 
MEMORIAL EVENT AT ROME\'S CITY HALL WHERE HE SPOKE ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING HISTORY IN FIGHT AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM. 
 THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY HOSTS THIS ANNUAL COMMEMORATION 
AND CONDUCTS DURING THE YEAR A NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL TRIPS 
FOR ITALIAN CHILDREN TO THE ROME SYNAGOGUE AND JEWISH SCHOOL, 
WITH THE FULL SUPPORT AND BACKING OF THE HOLY SEE ITSELF.  IN 
ADDITION, IT CONDUCTS AN IMPRESSIVE ANNUAL INTER-RELIGIOUS 
DIALOGUE ENCOUNTER WITH ACTIVE HOLY SEE AND JEWISH 
PARTICIPATION AIMED AT FOSTERING UNDERSTANDING AND 
EMPHASIZING COMMON VALUES OF DIVERSE FAITHS IN THE SPIRIT OF 
THE POPE\'S 1986 ASSISI INTER-FAITH INITIATIVE.

CURIAL VIEWS DIFFER ON STATE OF EUROPEAN ANTI-SEMITISM

9. (C) DESPITE THE REAL PROGRESS MADE OVER THE LAST FORTY 
YEARS IN THE VATICAN\'S RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM AND THE STRONG 
LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE OF POPE JOHN PAUL II, THE POPE\'S AND 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05545  02 OF 04  141511Z 
KASPER\'S ENTHUSIASM IS NOT ALWAYS REFLECTED FROM ALL PARTS OF 
THE CURIA.  INDEED, SOME REMAIN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE THREAT OF 
RESURGENT ANTI-SEMITISM, REGARDING RECENT ATTACKS PRIMARILY 
AS A REACTION OF DISAFFECTED MOSLEM IMMIGRANTS TO THE 
SITUATION IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES.  AS ONE  CONTACT 
ASSERTED: \"WHEN ISRAEL WITHDRAWS FROM THE TERRITORIES THE 
ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACKS WILL GO AWAY.\" 
 
10. (C) MOREOVER, ANTI-JUDAIC AND ANTI-SEMITIC SENTIMENTS 
HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETELY ERADICATED FROM THE EUROPEAN MEMBERS 
OF THE CURIA.  IN A FEW CASES, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED EUROPEAN 
CURIAL OFFICIALS WHO HAVE MANIFESTED REMNANTS OF ANTI-SEMITIC 
SENTIMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, AN OLDER DESK OFFICER OF FRENCH 
ORIGIN COMPLAINED TO POLOFF THAT THE USG\'S STRONG INTEREST IN 
MODERN EUROPEAN ANTI-SEMITISM STEMMED FROM THE \"EXCESSIVE 
INFLUENCE OF JEWS IN YOUR MEDIA AND GOVERNMENT.\"  HE WENT ON 
TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE VATICAN SHARES USG CONCERNS ABOUT 
RESURGENT EUROPEAN ANTI-SEMITISM, BUT THAT IT WASN\'T QUITE AS 
WORRIED AS THE USG APPEARED TO BE.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE 
JEWISH COMMUNITY IN EUROPE WAS NOW SO FULLY INTEGRATED THAT 
THEIR JEWISHNESS IS MORE A RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION THAN A

11. (C) IN A NOVEMBER 13 CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR, 
RICCARDO DI SEGNI, CHIEF RABBI OF ROME, PRAISED THE HOLY SEE 
FOR ITS ROLE IN DENYING ANTI-SEMITES A THEOLOGICAL BASIS FOR 
THEIR PREJUDICE.  HE SAID THAT THE VATICAN II REFORMS HAVE 
\"CUT THE TREE AT ITS ROOTS -- BUT THE ROOTS ARE STILL THERE, 
WAITING FOR WATER.\"  IN THAT REGARD HE BELIEVED THAT POPE 
JOHN PAUL\'S HIGHLY SYMBOLIC GESTURES SUCH AS THE 1986 VISIT 
TO THE ROME SYNAGOGUE HAD DONE MUCH TO EDUCATE THE ITALIAN 
AND EUROPEAN PUBLIC.  REGARDING THE SCOPE OF THE 
ANTI-SEMITISM PROBLEM, DE SEGNI MAINTAINED THAT EACH COUNTRY 
HAS TO BE ANALYZED IN ITS OWN RIGHT.  HE AGREED THAT MANY 
RECENT ANTI-SEMITIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN 
FRANCE, RESULTED LARGELY FROM FRUSTRATIONS OF DISAFFECTED 
IMMIGRANT YOUTHS FROM NORTH AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  SUCH 
ATTACKS, HE SAID, WERE UNKNOWN IN ITALY.  THE FRENCH 
PHENOMENON WITH ITS MIDDLE EAST LINKS, HE BELIEVED, WAS 
DIFFERENT FROM THE HISTORIC ANTI-SEMITISM THAT STILL EXISTS 
IN EUROPE.  CITING LOCAL SOCCER HOOLIGANS\' USE OF THE WORD 
\"JEW\" AS AN EPITHET, DE SEGNI INDICATED THAT ITALIAN 
AUTHORITIES NEEDED TO WORK HARDER BOTH TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC 
AND CREATE A MORE JUST ECONOMIC ORDER, SO THAT MARGINALIZED 
PEOPLE DO NOT MISTAKENLY TARGET JEWS TO EXPRESS THEIR 
DISAFFECTION. 
 
12. (C) OUR ISRAELI EMBASSY CONTACTS ALSO WELCOMED THE POPE\'S 
PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM AND HIS MANY 
IMPORTANT SYMBOLIC ACTS DURING HIS PAPACY.  THEY NOTED THAT 
THE COMMITMENT TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM WAS INCORPORATED IN 
THE \"FUNDAMENTAL ACT\" AGREEMENT THAT FORMED THE BASIS OF 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND ISRAEL, AND WAS 
THUS BOTH A LEGAL AND MORAL COMMITMENT FOR THE HOLY SEE.  THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05545  03 OF 04  141511Z 
ISRAELI EMBASSY HAS IN RECENT TIMES FOUND THE HOLY SEE SLOWER 
TO RAISE ITS VOICE IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC ACTS AND RELUCTANT 
TO REPEAT ITS CONDEMNATIONS OF ANTI-SEMITISM OUT OF FEAR THAT 
SUCH STATEMENTS WOULD BE INTERPRETED IN THE ARAB WORLD AS 
SUPPORT FOR THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENTS POLICIES IN THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES.  THE ISRAELI EMBASSY CONTINUES TO EMPHASIZE THE 
IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THESE ISSUES SEPARATE, AND RECENTLY 
FOUND SUPPORT FROM CARDINAL ROGER ETCHEGARAY, WHO PUBLICLY 
STATED THAT CRITICISM OF ISRAELI POLICIES MUST NEVER SLIP 
INTO REDUCED VIGILANCE AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM.  THE EMBASSY, 
FOR ITS PART, IS WORKING WITH THE HOLY SEE TO DEVELOP 
EDUCATIONAL AND EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AND TO SUPPORT THE STUDY OF 
JUDAISM AT CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES.  DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, 
ISRAEL\'S RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE ARE CURRENTLY COOL AS A 
RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S HARD-LINE TACTICS IN THE WEST BANK 
AND GAZA. 
FROM THE CURIA\'S PERSPECTIVE, THE SPIRAL OF VIOLENCE IN 
ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND THE RESULTANT EXODUS 
OF THE REGION\'S CHRISTIANS, IS A MATTER OF PRIMARY CONCERN 
AND A SUBJECT OF REPEATED PAPAL INTERVENTIONS.

13.   (SBU)  WE CAN CONTINUE TO COUNT ON THE HOLY SEE -- AND 
THIS POPE IN PARTICULAR -- TO BE A VITAL PARTNER IN COMBATING 
ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE TODAY.  DESPITE OCCASIONAL 
DIFFICULTIES AND LINGERING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH AND JUDAISM, WE CAN CONTINUE TO COUNT ON THE HOLY SEE

AND KEEP PRESSURE ON EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TO COUNTER SIGNS OF 
RESURGENT ANTI-SEMITISM.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE IS MORE 
THAN WILLING TO USE BOTH ITS VOICE AND VOTE ON SUCH MORAL 
ISSUES AS ANTI-SEMITISM AT EUROPEAN ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE 
OSCE.  POST WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE HOLY SEE TO 
HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR VIGILANCE AGAINST RESURGENT 
ANTI-SEMITISM, NO MATTER WHAT ITS ORIGIN.  LAST WEEK, FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE AMBASSADOR BEGAN COORDINATING WITH HOLY SEE 
COM\'S TO ENSURE THAT THE ANTI-SEMITISM THEME WILL BE PART OF 
THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS\' ANNUAL GREETING TO THE POPE, WHICH 
SHAPES THE POPE\'S ANNUAL DIPLOMATIC CORPS ADDRESS.  IN 
ADDITION, THE AMBASSADOR MEETS REGULARLY WITH ANTI-DEFAMATION 
LEAGUE PRESIDENT ABRAHAM FOXMAN AND RELEVANT VATICAN 
OFFICIALS TO KEEP THIS ISSUE IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR AGENDA 
AND TO HIGHLIGHT U.S. CONCERNS.  LATER THIS MONTH, THE 
AMBASSADOR WILL BE RECEIVING THE \"NOSTRA AETATE\" AWARD IN NEW 
YORK FROM THE CENTER FOR JEWISH-CHRISTIAN RELATIONS AT SACRED 
HEART UNIVERSITY, REFLECTING HIS COMMITMENT TO COMBATING 
ANTI-SEMITISM.  WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND ACTIVELY

DEEPENING THE CATHOLIC-JEWISH DIALOGUE.

1. (C) THE HOLY SEE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF CIVIL 
VIOLENCE IN VENEZUELA IN THE COMING MONTHS, AND THE POPE 
HIMSELF HAS URGED THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS TO \"COOL IT\" ON 
POLITICAL ACTIVISM AND INSTEAD TO ENCOURAGE DIALOGUE.  THE 
HOLY SEE VIEWED THE BISHOPS\' OCTOBER LETTER ENCOURAGING 
DIALOGUE, READ IN VENEZUELAN CHURCHES, AS A POSITIVE STEP. 
HOLY SEE DIRECTOR OF CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS MSGR. GIORGIO LINGUA 
WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE VENEZUELAN CHURCH WAS FACILITATING 
POLITICAL DIALOGUE IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN BY PROVIDING A VENUE 
FOR TALKS.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HOPES VENEZUELANS WILL 
REFRAIN FROM DANGEROUS STREET PROTESTS AND AN INCONCLUSIVE 
CONSULTATIVE REFERENDUM, AND INSTEAD MAKE FULL USE OF THE 
TIME TO PREPARE FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL RECALL REFERENDUM IN 
AUGUST.  IN LIGHT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR CHAVEZ AMONG THE 
VENEZUELAN POPULATION, LINGUA WAS NOT SANGUINE ABOUT THE 
OPPOSITION\'S CHANCES OF SUCCESS, EVEN IF THEY CONCENTRATE 
FULLY ON ORGANIZING FOR AN AUGUST RECALL REFERENDUM. LINGUA 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP VELASCO GARCIA OF 
CARACAS HAD BEEN TOO CLOSE TO THE COUP PLOTTERS LAST APRIL.

NOVEMBER 18 HE FEARED A VIOLENT DENOUEMENT IN VENEZUELA.  END 
SUMMARY

LOWERING THE CHURCH PROFILE

2.  (C)  POLOFFS MET WITH HOLY SEE DIRECTOR FOR CARIBBEAN 
AFFAIRS MSGR. GIORGIO LINGUA NOVEMBER 7 AND AGAIN NOVEMBER 14 
TO DISCUSS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S VIEWS OF THE DEVELOPING 
CIVIL CONFRONTATION IN VENEZUELA.  LINGUA SAID HE WAS WORRIED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05607  01 OF 02  191053Z 
ABOUT THE DETERIORATION OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION, AND 
INDICATED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD COUNSELED THE VENEZUELAN 
CHURCH TO BACK OFF FROM WHAT HAD BEEN AN OVERLY VISIBLE 
PRESENCE DURING THE APRIL 2002 ATTEMPTED COUP.  LINGUA TOLD 
US THAT WHEN THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS MADE THEIR \"AD LIMINA\" 
VISIT TO REPORT TO THE POPE IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR (NOTE: THESE 
OCCUR ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE, ROUGHLY EVERY FIVE YEARS), THE 
POPE HAD TOLD THEM TO \"COOL IT\" ON THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVISM. 
LINGUA, SMILING, THOUGHT THE MESSAGE FROM THE POPE \"MIGHT NOT 
HAVE SUNK IN.\"  HE ADMITTED THAT CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP VELASCO 
GARCIA OF CARACAS WAS PERHAPS TOO CLOSE TO THE COUP PLOTTERS, 
AND DEMONSTRATED POOR JUDGMENT IN PARTICIPATING IN THE 
CARMONA \"INAUGURATION CEREMONY.\" 
 
3. (C)  THE HOLY SEE WOULD PREFER THAT THE VENEZUELAN CHURCH 
NOT ENGAGE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS DIRECTLY, BUT RATHER SEEK 
TO STIMULATE A PEACEFUL DIALOGUE BETWEEN VENEZUELA\'S 
POLITICAL ELEMENTS.  TO THAT END, THE HOLY SEE, THROUGH ITS 
NUNCIO, HAD WORKED WITH THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE TO 
DRAFT A LETTER READ OCTOBER 20 FROM ALL VENEZUELAN PULPITS. 
LINGUA SHOWED US A SPANISH LANGUAGE TEXT OF THIS LETTER AND 
SAID IT WAS A CONSTRUCTIVE STEP.  THE LETTER MADE AN 
\"ANGUISHED APPEAL\" TO THE PEOPLE TO OVERCOME THE MOUNTING 
TENSIONS IN THE NATION AND CALLED FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. 
THE BISHOPS REAFFIRMED \"THE IMPERATIVE TO AVOID ALL VIOLENCE, 
WITH ITS FATAL CONSEQUENCES, AND TO TAKE POSITIVE STEPS 
TOWARD UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENTS THAT WILL MAKE 
COEXISTENCE POSSIBLE.\" AT THE SAME TIME THE LETTER EMPHASIZED 
THAT \"THERE IS A RIGHT TO GIVE ONE\'S OPINION, TO ASSOCIATE, 
AND TO PROTEST FREELY,\" AND REMINDED PARISHIONERS THAT IT WAS 
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE PUBLIC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05607  01 OF 02  191053Z 
SECURITY AND ORDER. 
 
4.  (C)  ASKED ABOUT THE POLITICAL ROAD AHEAD, LINGUA SAID 
THE HOLY SEE HOPES VENEZUELANS WILL REFRAIN FROM DANGEROUS 
STREET PROTESTS AND AN INCONCLUSIVE CONSULTATIVE REFERENDUM, 
AND INSTEAD MAKE FULL USE OF THE TIME TO PREPARE FOR A 
CONSTITUTIONAL RECALL REFERENDUM IN AUGUST.  POINTING OUT 
THAT CHAVEZ STILL ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE, THOUGH ERODING, 
POPULAR SUPPORT, LINGUA WAS NOT SANGUINE ABOUT THE 
OPPOSITION\'S CHANCES OF SUCCESS, EVEN IF IT CONCENTRATES 
FULLY ON ORGANIZING FOR AN AUGUST RECALL REFERENDUM.

SUBJECT: HOLY SEE URGES CHURCH TO PROMOTE VENEZUELAN 
DIALOGUE, AVOID POLITICAL ACTIVISM 
 
IN FACILITATING VENEZUELA\'S POLITICAL DIALOGUE IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH OAS ENVOY GAVIRIA, WE CHECKED WITH LINGUA AGAIN TO SEE 
WHETHER THE HOLY SEE HAD CHANGED ITS APPROACH SINCE OUR 
PREVIOUS MEETING, AND WHETHER THIS NEW ROLE INDICATED THAWING 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND PRESIDENT CHAVEZ.  LINGUA 
DOWNPLAYED THE EXTENT OF THE CHURCH\'S ROLE, INDICATING IT HAD 
ONLY PROVIDED A MEETING SPACE AND HAD NOT MEDIATED ANY OF THE 
DISCUSSIONS.  AT ANY RATE, HE SAID, THE MEETING SPACE AT THE 
SEMINARY OUTSIDE OF CARACAS PRESENTED LOGISTICAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  05607  02 OF 02  191054Z 
DIFFICULTIES, AND SO THE PARTICIPANTS WOULD NO LONGER MEET 
THERE.  HE EXPRESSED SOME SATISFACTION THAT CHAVEZ HAD AGREED 
TO USE THAT FACILITY, BUT INSISTED THAT CHURCH/GOV RELATIONS 
WERE \"NO BETTER AND NO WORSE THAN IN APRIL\" (I.E. PRETTY 
BAD).  HE INDICATED THAT CHAVEZ GOONS CONTINUE TO HARASS SOME 
CLERGY, BUT AS YET NONE HAD BEEN PHYSICALLY HARMED.  HAVING 
SAID THAT, HE BACKTRACKED A BIT FROM HIS EARLIER INSISTENCE 
ON A HANDS-OFF ROLE FOR THE CHURCH, AND SAID THE HOLY SEE 
WOULD SUPPORT A FORMAL CHURCH ROLE IN FACILITATING POLITICAL 
DIALOGUE, \"ONLY IF BOTH SIDES FORMALLY REQUEST IT.\" 
 
6.  (C)  WE MENTIONED TO LINGUA POLLING DATA THAT INDICATED A 
MAJORITY OF VENEZUELANS THOUGHT THE CHURCH COULD INDEED PLAY 
A FACILITATING ROLE.  HE WAS SURPRISED, ADMITTING THE HOLY 
SEE BELIEVES IT HAS ALMOST NO SUPPORT AMONG VENEZUELAN POOR. 
HOWEVER, HE SAID THE HOLY SEE WOULD STICK WITH ITS ORIGINAL 
ANALYSIS -- POLITICAL ORGANIZING SHOULD FOCUS ON A 
CONSTITUTIONAL RECALL REFERENDUM FOR AUGUST NEXT YEAR.  IN 
THE MEANTIME, CHAVEZ\' SUPPORT CONTINUES TO ERODE, AND THE 
MORE HE DEMONSTRATES HE CAN\'T DELIVER, THE MORE HIS 
POPULARITY WILL SLIP.  ASKED WHETHER THE NUNCIO MAINTAINS A 
REGULAR DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION, LINGUA SAID NO MORE 
THAN HE HAS WITH ANY OTHER ELEMENT OF VENEZUELAN SOCIETY. 
 
7. (C)  AT A LUNCH WITH AMBASSADOR, NOVEMBER 18, FORMER 
VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR (AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE) 
IGNACIO QUINTANA EXPRESSED FEARS THAT CONDITIONS WOULD 
CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE IN VENEZUELA.  QUINTANA SAID HE 
THOUGHT THAT CHAVEZ WOULD EVENTUALLY BE TAKEN OUT BY A COUP. 
IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY WHETHER BLOOD WOULD BE 
SHED, QUINTANA SAID \"YES, UNFORTUNATELY.\" 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (C)  THE HOLY SEE FINDS ITSELF IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE 
SITUATION VIS-A-VIS VENEZUELA.  CLEARLY, THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH\'S RELATIONS WITH POPULIST PRESIDENT CHAVEZ ARE POOR 
AND RISK GETTING WORSE.  THE HOLY SEE, WHICH RETAINS VIVID 
INSTITUTIONAL MEMORIES OF LEFTIST SUPPRESSION OF CLERGY IN 
SPAIN AND MEXICO, WOULD NEVER WISH TO SEE RELATIONS 
DETERIORATE TO THE POINT WHERE THE CLERGY AND THE FAITHFUL 
WERE AT RISK OF PHYSICAL HARM.  NONETHELESS, THE HOLY SEE 
WOULD JUST AS CLEARLY PREFER TO SEE CHURCH/STATE RELATIONS IN 
VENEZUELA RETURN TO THE SITUATION THAT EXISTED IN THE 
PRE-CHAVEZ ERA.  LINGUA WAS ACUTELY AWARE OF IRONY OF THE 
CHURCH\'S LACK OF SUPPORT AMONG THE POORER CLASSES IN 
VENEZUELA -- AND OF CHAVEZ\' PUBLIC ACCUSATION LAST JANUARY 
THAT THE CHURCH WAS A \"CANCER ON VENEZUELAN SOCIETY\" BECAUSE 
OF ITS ASSOCIATION WITH THE \"OLIGARCHS.\"  RECALLING THAT 
CHAVEZ\' OUTBURST WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE PAPAL NUNCIO\'S ANNUAL 
GREETING ON BEHALF OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, LINGUA ONLY 
HALF-JOKINGLY SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT 
REACTIONS WOULD BE TO WHAT THE NUNCIO WOULD SAY THIS COMING 
JANUARY. 
 
9. (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED:  THE CONTINUED ACTIVISM OF THE 
VENEZUELAN CLERGY IN THE FACE OF THE POPE\'S CAUTION DOES NOT 
SURPRISE US.  EVEN THE POPE HAS LIMITED SWAY OVER WHAT A 
BISHOP DOES IN HIS OWN DIOCESE, UNLESS HIS POLITICAL 
ACTIVITIES DIRECTLY THREATEN THE DOCTRINE AND MORALS OF THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05607  02 OF 02  191054Z 
CATHOLIC CHURCH OR THE HOLY SEE\'S FOREIGN POLICY.  WE WOULD 
WELCOME EMBASSY CARACAS\'S ASSESSMENT OF HOW RESPONSIVE TO THE 
POPE\'S INSTRUCTIONS THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS HAVE BEEN.  FROM 
WHERE WE SIT, THEIR OCTOBER 20 LETTER TO PARISHIONERS SEEMS 
AN EFFORT TO MEET THE POPE AT LEAST HALFWAY.

PAGE 02        VATICA  05625  01 OF 02  191610Z 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON HOLY SEE DEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTER EQUIVALENT LEONARDO SANDRI NOVEMBER 16 TO 
EXPRESS U.S. CONCERN OVER THE LACK OF HOLY SEE 
INVOLVEMENT REGARDING THE GROWING THREAT OF HUNGER AND 
STARVATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND, SPECIFICALLY, THE 
ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT\'S REJECTION OF U.S. FOOD ASSISTANCE 
BECAUSE OF ITS BIO-TECH CONTENT.   AFTER HEARING THE 
DETAILS OF THE SITUATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, AND IN 
RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADORS\' FORCEFUL PLEA FOR THE HOLY 
SEE TO STEP FORWARD IN RESPONSE TO THIS CLEAR MORAL 
ISSUE, SANDRI SAID HE WOULD DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH PRIME 
MINISTER EQUIVALENT SODANO AND FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN 
AND GET BACK TO THE AMBASSADOR THIS WEEK WITH A RESPONSE. 
TO INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON THE HOLY SEE, THE AMBASSADOR 
ALSO PUBLISHED AN OP-ED IN ITALY\'S LARGEST CATHOLIC DAILY 
NEWSPAPER, AVVENIRE, OUTLINING THE MORAL DIMENSIONS OF 
THE ISSUE AND URGING THE WORLD COMMUNITY TO FEED THE 
HUNGRY FOOD RATHER THAN FEAR. 
2.  (U) IN A NOVEMBER 16 MEETING WITH DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER EQUIVALENT ARCHBISHOP LEONARDO SANDRI, 
AMBASSADOR OUTLINED U.S. CONCERNS OVER THE MOUNTING FOOD 
CRISIS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE BAFFLING DECISION OF 
THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT TO REJECT U.S. FOOD ASSISTANCE OUT 
UNJUSTIFIED FEARS OF BIOTECH FOODS.  THE AMBASSADOR 
POINTED OUT THAT, IN THE FACE OF THE GRAVE HUMANITARIAN 
SITUATION IT CURRENTLY FACES, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZAMBIA 
HAD ASKED THAT THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM REMOVE U.S. MAIZE 
FROM THE COUNTRY EVEN THOUGH MILLING THE GRAIN WOULD 
COMPLETELY ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THEY HAVE PUBLICLY CITED 
FOR NOT ACCEPTING THE GRAIN.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05625  01 OF 02  191610Z 
THE UNCONSTRUCTIVE, POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING ROLE 
PLAYED BY THE JESUIT CENTER FOR THEOLOGICAL REFLECTION IN 
ZAMBIA, WHICH HAD ENCOURAGED THE GOVERNMENT TO REJECT 
BIOTECH FOODS, AND ALSO NOTED THAT ZAMBIA\'S CATHOLIC 
BISHOPS IN ZAMBIA HAVE BEEN LARGELY SILENT IN THE FACE OF 
THIS CRISIS.  WITH LIVES AT RISK, THE AMBASSADOR 
EMPHASIZED, THE U.S. BELIEVED THE HOLY SHOULD FOLLOW THE 
UN, THE WHO, AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN ISSUING 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT ACKNOWLEDGE THE SAFETY FOR HUMAN 
CONSUMPTION OF THE U.S. MAIZE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF 
FEEDING THE HUNGRY, ADDING THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S STRONG 
MORAL VOICE ON THIS ISSUE COULD POTENTIALLY HELP SAVE 
THOUSANDS OF LIVES. 
3. (U) IN RESPONSE, SANDRI ASKED IF THE U.S. WAS 
PROVIDING THE FOOD FREE OR SELLING THE FOOD.  THE 
AMBASSADOR SAID IT WAS PROVIDED TO THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM 
FREE OF CHARGE, ADDING THAT WE PROVIDE NEARLY 70 PERCENT 
OF THE FOOD TO THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM FOR SOUTHERN 
AFRICA. WITH THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN SOUTHERN 
AFRICA WORSENING AND DEMANDS ON DONORS INCREASING, 
DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD U.S.-SUPPLIED FOOD RELIEF WOULD 
HAVE A POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING EFFECT, THE AMBASSADOR 
NOTED. 
 
4. (SBU) COMPARING THE HOLY SEE\'S AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN 
BISHOPS SILENCE WITH THE CLEAR STATEMENTS OF OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS AND COUNTRIES, THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT 
THAT \"EVEN GREENPEACE HAD CAVED IN AND SAID, IN LIGHT OF 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH PEOPLE STARVING THEY COULD NO 
LONGER SUSTAIN THEIR POSITION AGAINST FEEDING PEOPLE 
BIOTECH FOODS.\"  WITH EVEN GREENPEACE SHOWING THEIR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05625  01 OF 02  191610Z 
COMPASSION IN THIS SITUATION, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED, 
\"WHERE IS THE CHURCH\"? 
 
5. (SBU) SANDRI RESPONDED BY ASSERTING THAT THE EUROPEAN 
UNION WAS AGAINST BIOTECH FOODS AND THAT WAS 
PROBLEMATICAL FOR THE HOLY SEE.  THE AMBASSADOR CLARIFIED 
THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAD APPROVED FOR 
COMMERCIALIZATION A NUMBER OF GM PRODUCTS, AND NOTED THAT 
OBJECTIONS RELATED MORE TO HOW TO STRUCTURE 
COMMERCIALIZATION RATHER THAN CONCERN OVER THE SAFETY OF 
BIOTECH FOODS.  HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S 
SCIENTIFIC ADVISORS, THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, 
HAVE TOLD US THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS FOOD, AND 
HAVE ISSUED REPORTS TO THAT EFFECT. IN CLOSING, THE 
AMBASSADOR SAID HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE POPE, WITH 
HIS EMPHASIS ON THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE AND HIS 
OPPOSITION TO EUTHANASIA AND ABORTION, KNOWS OF THIS 
SERIOUS SITUATION AND IS NOT EQUALLY OPPOSED TO

SUBJECT: SODANO HINTS AT SHIFT IN HOLY SEE UN STATUS; TAKES 
AIM AT PREEMPTIVE STRIKE, EU CONSTITUTION 
 
 
1.   (U) THE HOLY SEE IS CONSIDERING  UPGRADING ITS STATUS 
AT THE UN FROM PERMANENT OBSERVER TO FULL MEMBER.  IN AN 
INTERVIEW WITH CENTRIST ITALIAN DAILY \"CORRIERE DELLA SERA\" 
PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 24, VATICAN SECRETARY OF STATE (PM 
EQUIVALENT) CARDINAL ANGELO SODONO SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  05714  251549Z 
STUDYING WAYS TO AUGMENT ITS PRESENCE AT THE UN.  ASKED IF 
THIS MEANT BECOMING A FULL MEMBER, SODANO RESPONDED, \"IF IT 
WOULD BE USEFUL, I\'M NOT EXCLUDING IT.\"  SODANO NOTED THAT 
SWITZERLAND HAD RECENTLY CHANGED ITS STATUS TO MEMBER AND 
THAT, \"THE FORM OF OUR PRESENCE IS AN OPEN QUESTION.\" 
 
2.   (U) SODANO ALSO TOUCHED ON A POSSIBLE PREEMPTIVE STRIKE 
ON IRAQ SAYING THAT THE TERM DID NOT FEATURE IN THE UN\'S 
VOCABULARY AND THAT DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONS SHOULD 
BE EXHAUSTED BEFORE ANY OTHER HYPOTHESIS IS PROPOSED. 
 
3.   (U) SODANO REAFFIRMED THE HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE TO SEE 
CHRISTIANITY, AND RELIGION IN GENERAL, GIVEN A PLACE IN THE 
PROPOSED EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION (SEPTEL).  HE SAID THE HOLY 
SEE EXPECTS EUROPE\'S CHRISTIAN PATRIMONY TO BE MENTIONED IN 
ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONSTITUTION -- DEALING WITH EUROPEAN 
VALUES -- AND THAT A COMPLETELY NEW ARTICLE WOULD ENSHRINE 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE RIGHT OF RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN 
EUROPE TO SELF-GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATION. 
 
4.   (SBU) COMMENT: SODANO\'S COMMENTS ON THE HOLY SEE\'S 
STATUS AT THE UN REFLECT SOME INTERNAL FRUSTRATION ABOUT THE 
LIMITATIONS ON THE HOLY SEE\'S VOICE IN INTERNATIONAL FORA 
ARISING FROM THEIR STATUS AS A PERMANENT OBSERVER. 
TRADITIONALLY, THE HOLY SEE HAS ENJOYED THE FREEDOM ITS 
UNIQUE STATUS OFFERS IT AS A VOICE WITHIN, BUT NOT OF, THE 
UN SYSTEM.  WHILE A MORAL VOICE HAS SOME CLOUT, MANY VATICAN 
DIPLOMATS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT A VOTE -- ESPECIALLY IN THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL AND AFFILIATED UN AGENCIES -- MAY BE MORE 
EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING THE HOLY SEE\'S INTERNATIONAL AGENDA. 
FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE\'S OUTGOING FAO REPRESENTATIVE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05714  251549Z 
RECENTLY SUGGESTED IN AN \"30 DAYS\" ARTICLEARTICLE IN 
CATHOLIC MONTHLY \"30 DAYS\" THAT THE HOLY SEE COULD HAVE BEEN 
MORE INFLUENTIAL IN COMBATING WORLD HUNGER IF IT WERE A 
VOTING MEMBER OF THE FAO.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE 
ONGOING STRUGGLE OVER A GLOBAL BAN ON HUMAN CLONING HAS 
STRENGTHENED THE DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE HOLY SEE. 
SWITZERLAND\'S CHANGE OF STATUS HAS CLEARLY SPARKED SOME 
RECONSIDERATION WITHIN THE HOLY SEE AS TO WHETHER THE TIME 
IS RIGHT TO MAKE A SHIFT.  WITH CURRENT UN PERMREP RENATO 
MARTINO RETURNING TO ROME AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS IN NEW YORK, 
THIS ISSUE IS LIKELY TO BE INTENSIVELY DEBATED IN THE MONTHS 
AHEAD.  A DECISION TO UPGRADE WOULD MARK A SIGNIFICANT 
DEPARTURE IN THE HOLY SEE\'S APPROACH TO PURSUIT OF ITS 
FOREIGN POLICY GOALS.

1.   (SBU) ALTHOUGH THE HOLY SEE IS PRESSING HARD FOR THE 
EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTINENT\'S CHRISTIAN 
HERITAGE, THIS DRIVE IS IN NO WAY INTENDED TO SUGGEST HOLY 
SEE OPPOSITION TO TURKEY\'S EU MEMBERSHIP.  ON THE CONTRARY, 
THIS EFFORT PREDATES THE CURRENT DEBATE OVER TURKEY, AND THE 
HOLY SEE SPECIFICALLY FAVORS CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE THAT 
WOULD ENSURE FREEDOM OF WORSHIP TO ALL FAITHS.  IN PUSHING 
FOR A \"CHRISTIAN HERITAGE\" REFERENCE AND OTHER PROVISIONS 
RELATING TO RELIGION, THE HOLY SEE IS SEEKING A FOUNDATION 
ON WHICH TO COUNTER THE INCREASINGLY DOMINANT SECULARISM 
WITHIN EUROPE AND TO REINVIGORATE THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN 
EUROPEAN CULTURE.  THE HOLY SEE IN NO WAY SEEKS TO EXCLUDE 
OTHER FAITHS OR PHILOSOPHIES, AND HAS TOLD US DIRECTLY THEY 
HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH A PREDOMINANTLY ISLAMIC STATE SUCH AS 
TURKEY BEING A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION -- A DECISION IN 
WHICH THEY HAVE NO DIRECT ROLE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
EUROPE\'S CHRISTIAN ROOTS IN ARID SOIL 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) THE HOLY SEE IS PRESSING EUROPEANS HARD TO ENSURE 
THAT THE PROPOSED EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION INCLUDES A REFERENCE 
TO THE CONTINENT\'S CHRISTIAN HERITAGE, WHILE AT THE SAME 
TIME MAKING CLEAR THAT JURIDICAL PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE TO 
PROTECT ALL RELIGIOUS FAITHS.  FROM THE POPE ON DOWN, THE 
HOLY SEE HAS BEEN LOBBYING EUROPEAN POLICY MAKERS ACTIVELY 
IN RECENT MONTHS.  ACCORDING TO THE POPE, \"CHRISTIANITY IS A 
CENTRAL AND INHERENT ELEMENT\" OF THE EUROPEAN IDENTITY, AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05753  01 OF 03  271518Z 
\"THE CHRISTIAN FAITH FORMED THE CULTURE OF THE CONTINENT.\" 
FRAMING THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THE HOLY SEE\'S CURRENT FOCUS 
ON THE EU CONSTITUTION, THE POPE TOLD THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
IN HIS ANNUAL ADDRESS LAST JANUARY (REF A) THAT \"THE 
MARGINALIZATION OF RELIGIONS, WHICH HAVE CONTRIBUTED AND 
CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CULTURE AND HUMANITY OF WHICH 
EUROPE IS LEGITIMATELY PROUD, STRIKES ME BOTH AS AN 
INJUSTICE AND AN ERROR IN PERSPECTIVE.\"  REFERRING TO THE 
HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION, HE ADDED: 
\"TO RECOGNIZE AN INDISPUTABLE HISTORICAL FACT IN NO WAY 
MEANS TO DISREGARD THE MODERN DEMAND OF STATES TO HAVE AN 
APPROPRIATE NON-CONFESSIONAL CHARACTER.\" 
 
3. (U) THIS FALL, THE HOLY SEE HAS INTENSIFIED ITS OUTREACH 
TO EU COUNTRIES WHEN IT CALLED IN ALL EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS 
TO OUTLINE ITS PRIORITIES FOR THE FINAL CONSTITUTION.  THESE 
PRIORITIES ENCOMPASS REFERENCES TO FIVE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES: 
CENTRALITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, 
SOLIDARITY (THE SEARCH FOR THE COMMON GOOD), SUBSIDIARITY 
AND PARTICIPATION, AND THE SHARING OF RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN 
THE CHURCHES AND THE EU. 
 
4. (U) IN ADDITION, THE HOLY SEE IS ALSO SEEKING JURIDICAL 
RECOGNITION OF THE CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES WITHIN 
THE CONSTITUTION.  THEY NOTE THAT RELIGION, CHURCHES, AND 
RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY EU LEGISLATION 
FOR DECADES, BUT THAT THERE ARE NO REFERENCES TO RELIGIONS 
IN THE TREATY PROVISIONS OR ANNEXED PROTOCOLS.  THEY POINT 
OUT THAT ISSUES SUCH AS NON-DISCRIMINATION, LABOR LAW, DATA 
PROTECTION, CULTURE, MEDIA LAW, CUSTOMS, FINANCES AND OTHER 
AREAS ALL IMPACT ON THE CHURCH, AND THAT THE ABSENCE OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05753  01 OF 03  271518Z 
JURIDICAL REFERENCES TO THEM WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS 
VACUUM.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE HOLY SEE IS SEEKING THROUGH THE 
COMMISSION OF EPISCOPATES OF THE EU A PROVISION ASSURING THE 
RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION OF CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS 
COMMUNITIES IN THEIR TEACHING AND ORGANIZATION.  THEY DO NOT 
BELIEVE THAT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OR CORPORATIVE SELF- 
DETERMINATION IS GUARANTEED BY ARTICLE 10 OF THE CHARTER OF 
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EU OR ARTICLE 9 OF THE EUROPEAN 
CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  FINALLY, THE HOLY SEE WOULD 
LIKE TO INCLUDE A PROVISION FOR CIVIL SOCIETY DIALOGUE AND 
CONSULTATION SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO THE ROLE OF CHURCHES 
AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES. 
 
5. (U) HAVING OUTLINED ITS GOALS, THE POPE HAS USED EVERY 
OPPORTUNITY THIS FALL TO PRESS HIS CASE.  IN HIS MEETINGS 
WITH EU AMBASSADOR\'S HE HAS REPEATED HIS INSISTENCE THAT 
EUROPE MUST BE FOUNDED ON \"COMMON VALUES, TAKING INTO 
ACCOUNT THE CHRISTIAN ROOTS OF THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE\" WHO 
LIVE ON THE CONTINENT.  LIKEWISE, THE POPE\'S MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION, VALERIE GISCARD 
D\'ESTAING, FOCUSED ON THE CONCERNS OF EUROPE\'S CHRISTIAN 
MAJORITY \"TO SEE THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR SPECIFIC 
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LIFE OF EUROPEAN SOCIETY RESPECTED\" AND 
TO HAVE THE STATUS THEY ENJOY IN CERTAIN NATIONAL

CHRISTIAN HERITAGE AS SEEN FROM THE CURIA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) VATICAN DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS MSGR. ETTORE 
BALESTRERO EXPANDED ON THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS IN A NOVEMBER 18 
MEETING WITH POLOFF.  BALESTRERO ESTIMATED THAT ON A 
CONTINENT OF ROUGHLY 700 MILLION PEOPLE, ABOUT 500 MILLION 
WERE CHRISTIAN. (NOTE: THE VATICAN\'S STATISTICAL YEARBOOK OF 
THE CHURCH COUNTS 702 MILLION POPULATION IN EUROPE WHICH 
INCLUDES ALL OF THE OSCE COUNTRIES EXCEPT THE U.S., CANADA 
AND TURKEY. END NOTE.)  FURTHERMORE, BALESTRERO RECALLED, 
CHRISTIANITY, UNLIKE OTHER FAITHS, WAS THE COMMON ELEMENT 
THAT BOUND THE CLASSIC EUROPEAN CIVILIZATIONS OF GREECE AND 
ROME TO MODERN EUROPE.  IT WAS CHRISTIAN MONKS WHO HAD 
PRESERVED EUROPE\'S KNOWLEDGE, AND JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ETHICS 
THAT INFORM MODERN NOTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE.  THE 
HOLY SEE WAS SIMPLY SEEKING TO ENSURE THAT EUROPE\'S 
CONSTITUTION RECOGNIZES THIS \"REALITY\" -- BUT WITHOUT ANY 
NORMATIVE OR OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES.  BALESTRERO SAID THE 
HOLY SEE STILL SUPPORTS LANGUAGE IN A EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION 
GUARANTEEING FREEDOM OF RELIGION, WITH IMPLEMENTATION 
DEVOLVED TO THE NATION-STATES ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF 
SUBSIDIARITY.  THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THIS, HE ADMITTED, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05753  02 OF 03  271520Z 
WOULD BE TO ENSHRINE THE PRIVILEGES AND RIGHTS OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN COUNTRIES WHERE CONCORDATS PROVIDE FOR 
THEM, AND ALSO FOR THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN COUNTRIES WHERE IT 
PREDOMINATES. 
 
7.  (SBU)  BALESTRERO ALSO NOTED A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE 
HOLY SEE\'S ROLE IN THIS DEBATE:  THE IDEA FOR LANGUAGE IN 
THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION ACKNOWLEDGING CHRISTIANITY WAS 
DEVELOPED BY A MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPEAN CHURCHES 
(CEC - A PROTESTANT GROUP).  ONLY LATER DID THE HOLY SEE 
(AND GREEK ORTHODOX) JOIN THEIR VOICES TO IT.  THE HOLY SEE, 
BALESTRERO CONTINUED, VIEWS THIS LANGUAGE AS ENHANCING THE 
IMPORTANCE OF ALL RELIGIONS IN EUROPE\'S DAILY LIFE. 
 
------------------------------------- 
A CHRISTIAN HERITAGE BUT ROOM FOR ALL 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.   (SBU) CHALLENGED ON THE UNDENIABLE CONTRIBUTION TO 
EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION FROM A JEWISH PRESENCE THAT PREDATES 
THE CHRISTIAN ONE, AND THE HALF-MILLENNIUM LONG ISLAMIC 
CONTROL OF IBERIA AND THE BALKANS, BALESTRERO SAID THE HOLY 
SEE DOES NOT DENY THESE INFLUENCES, THOUGH THEY REGARD THE 
CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE AS HISTORICALLY PREDOMINANT.  MOREOVER, 
THE HOLY SEE IS A CHRISTIAN ENTITY AND IS PUSHING FOR ITS 
CHRISTIAN INTERESTS; IT HAS NO OBJECTION TO ANYONE ELSE 
SEEKING TO INTERJECT LANGUAGE ON CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OTHER 
SOURCES.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD RECENTLY SHARED A TEXT OF 
PROPOSED LANGUAGE WITH JEWISH LEADERS, WHO SUPPORTED IT. 
MORE RECENTLY, DURING A VATICAN RADIO DISCUSSION ON THE 
EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION, EUROPEAN PEOPLES PARTY PRESIDENT, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05753  02 OF 03  271520Z 
WILFRED MARTENS, NOTED THAT THE POPE IS PUSHING FOR LANGUAGE 
SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE POLISH CONSTITUTION TO THE EFFECT 
THAT JUDEO-CHRISTIAN NOTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE CAN 
BE ARRIVED AT FROM BELIEF IN GOD OR OTHER SOURCES. 
 
9.  (U)  THE POPE HIMSELF, WHILE AFFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE OF 
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY RECOGNITION OF THE CONTINENT\'S CHRISTIAN 
HERITAGE, CAUTIONED IN A SEPTEMBER 13 ADDRESS THAT THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMON EUROPEAN IDENTITY SHOULD NOT BE USED 
AS AN EXCUSE FOR HOSTILITY TOWARDS MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. HE 
ARGUED AGAINST ANY TENDENCY TOWARD \"ISOLATION FROM THE REST 
OF THE WORLD.\" 
 
-------------------- 
ALSO ROOM FOR TURKEY 
-------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE PLACE OF TURKEY IN A 
NEW EUROPE AND THE FALLOUT FROM GISCARD D\'ESTAING\'S MEETING 
WITH THE POPE (RFTEL B), BALESTRERO SAID GISCARD 
D\'ESTAING\'S VIES WERE NOT THOSE OF THE HOLY SEE.  THE HOLY 
SEE HS NO OBJECTION TO TURKISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU, BU 
HAS NO ROLE IN DECIDING THAT MEMBERSHIP.  ACCORING TO 
BALESTRERO, THE HOLY SEE IS PLEASED WITH HE RESULTS OF THE

11.  (SBU) GISCARD D\'ESTAING\'S DECISION TO LAUNCH HIS

HIS MEETING WITH THE POPE HAS UNNECESSARILY LED MANY TO VIEW 
THE HOLY SEE AS INVOLVED IN WHAT IS A PURELY EUROPEAN 
DOGFIGHT.  AT NO TIME IN ANY OF OUR DISCUSSIONS OF THE HOLY 
SEE\'S LONGSTANDING CONCERNS ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE FUTURE EU 
CONSTITUTION HAS TURKEY\'S EU MEMBERSHIP EVER ARISEN.    THE 
HOLY SEE\'S INTERESTS -- BOTH IN IMBEDDING REFERENCES TO KEY 
VALUES AND ENSURING JURIDICAL PROTECTIONS -- PREDATE CURRENT 
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TURKEY\'S PLACE IN EUROPE.  TO BE SURE, 
THERE ARE MANY CATHOLIC INTELLECTUALS, SUCH AS ITALIAN 
MINISTER FOR EU AFFAIRS, ROCCO BUTTIGLIONE, WHO QUESTION 
WHETHER A MUSLIM TURKEY SHARES EUROPE\'S  VALUE SYSTEM, WHICH 
THEY REGARD AS DERIVED FROM JUDEO-CHRISTIAN TRADITIONS.  BUT 
EVEN BUTTIGLIONE IN A RECENT SPEECH HERE LEFT OPEN THE DOOR 
THAT TURKEY COULD OVERCOME THESE DOUBTS BY BETTER PROTECTING 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND STRENGTHENING ITS DEMOCRACY.  NEVERTHELESS, 
THE HOLY SEE REGARDS ITS CHALLENGE NOT AS ONE OF KEEPING THE

 1. (C)  SUMMARY:  ALTHOUGH THE COLD WAR IS OVER FOR MOST, 
THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNIST REGIMES 
IN ASIA.  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS AFFAIRS 
WITHOUT INTERFERENCE IS CURRENTLY BETTER IN 
VIETNAM THAN IN CHINA, BUT THE HOLY SEE IS WORKING IN VIETNAM 
TO ADVANCE ITS FREEDOM TO OPERATE ONE STEP AT A TIME.

LUIS MONTEMAYOR, THE HOLY SEE IS BATTING ABOUT .500 DURING 
ITS ANNUAL MEETINGS WITH THE GOV ON CHURCH ISSUES IN VIETNAM. 
 HOLY SEE DFM MIGLIORE IN AN OCTOBER 10-16 VISIT TO VIETNAM 
REACHED AGREEMENT ON APPOINTMENT OF SOME BISHOPS AND 
APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATORS, BUT FAILED IN OTHERS.  THE KEY 
ISSUE OF WHO WILL REPLACE CARDINAL PHAM DIHN TUNG REMAINS TO 
BE RESOLVED.  OTHER ISSUES CURRENTLY OF CONCERN TO THE HOLY 
SEE ARE THE OPPRESSION OF THE MONTAGNARDS AND THE 
IMPRISONMENT OF OUTSPOKEN POLITICAL ACTIVIST FATHER VAN LEE 
-- WHOM THE HOLY SEE VIEWS AS A VICTIM OF POLITICAL, NOT 
RELIGIOUS, OPPRESSION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------- 
PLAYING FOR THE LONG-TERM 
------------------------- 
 
2. (C)  AS BEFITS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF AN ENTITY WITH OVER 
2000 YEARS OF HISTORY BEHIND IT, HOLY SEE S/E ASIA COUNTRY 
DIRECTOR MSGR. LUIS MONTEMAYOR WAS CONFIDENT THAT EVENTUALLY 
THE HOLY SEE WOULD SUCCEED IN PRYING OPEN THE DOORS TO FULL 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN VIETNAM.  \"WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME\", HE 
NOTED.  THE HOLY SEE UNDERSTANDS THAT PROGRESS COMES SLOWLY 
WHEN DEALING WITH A COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT.  CONSEQUENTLY, IT 
ACCEPTS THAT, AS IT SEEKS TO SHUFFLE THE DECK ON 
APPOINTMENTS, IT IS LIKELY TO RECEIVE APPROVAL FOR ONLY SOME 
OF ITS REQUESTS OF THE GOV FOR FREEDOM TO ADMINISTER THE 
CHURCH.  ACCORDING TO MONTEMAYOR, THE HOLY SEE IS SEEKING TO 
MOVE CLERGY FROM THE MORE \"COMPLIANT\" 15 SOUTHERN DIOCESES 
CLOSELY LINKED TO ROME TO LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE MORE 
\"ALIENATED\" 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05803  01 OF 02  030646Z 
10 DIOCESES IN THE NORTH.  OVER THE LONG RUN THE HOLY SEE 
HOPES TO ENSURE BROADER ACCEPTANCE OF ROME\'S CENTRAL ROLE IN 
CHURCH AFFAIRS IN VIETNAM. 
 
3.  (C)  A KEY BAROMETER OF GOV FLEXIBILITY IS ITS ACCEPTANCE 
OF VATICAN APPOINTEES TO BISHOPS\' SEATS.  DURING THE OCTOBER 
VISIT TO VIETNAM BY VATICAN DFM CELESTINO MIGLIORE, THE 
VATICAN OBTAINED GOV AGREEMENT TO APPOINTING REV. JOSEPH VU 
VAN THIEM AS THE NEW BISHOP IN HAI PHONG, A COADJUTOR BISHOP 
IN CAN THO AND A SUCCESSOR TO THE BISHOP OF KONTUM.  THE GOV 
REJECTED THE HOLY SEE\'S CANDIDATES FOR THE POST OF COADJUTOR 
OF HANOI AND THE BISHOP TO HUNG HOA AS WELL AS THE REQUEST TO 
DIVIDE THE PROVINCE OF XUAN LOC INTO TWO APOSTOLIC 
TERRITORIES.  ALTHOUGH THE HOLY SEE AND GOV HAVE AGREED ON AN 
APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE DIOCESE OF HANOI, THE ISSUE 
OF NAMING A REPLACEMENT FOR 83-YEAR-OLD CARDINAL TUNG REMAINS 
UNSETTLED (NOTE: TUNG IS CONTINUING IN HIS SEE BECAUSE THE 
HOLY SEE DID NOT HAVE GOV SUPPORT FOR THE REPLACEMENT THEY 
DESIRED).  ACCORDING TO MONTEMAYOR, CARDINAL TUNG AND THE 
HOLY SEE REMAIN AT ODDS OVER HIS REPLACEMENT, AND THE HOLY 
SEE BELIEVES THE GOV IS BLOCKING THEIR CANDIDATE PER TUNG,S 
REQUEST.  THE GOV HAS ASKED FOR A LIST OF THREE CANDIDATES 
FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE, BUT THE HOLY SEE WILL ONLY SUBMIT ITS

5.  (C)  THE HOLY SEE IS A STAUNCH PROPONENT OF RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM, AND SEEKS TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY, SAID FATHER 
NGUYEN.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOLY SEE RECOGNIZED THAT THE RECENT 
IMPRISONMENT OF A LOCAL CATHOLIC PRIEST IN VIETNAM WAS A 
POLITICAL ACTION BASED ON HIS OUTSPOKEN POSITION ON GOV 
POLICIES RATHER THAN A SUPPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THE 
IMPRISONED FATHER VAN LEE HAD SPOKEN AGAINST THE GOV POSITION 
DURING A TRADE TREATY DISPUTE WITH THE U.S.  THE HOLY SEE,

CONDEMN IT AS A SUPPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THEY ARE 
CAREFUL NOT TO PLAY THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CARD TOO OFTEN, IN

VIOLATIONS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

6.  (U)  THE HOLY SEE REMAINS INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING 
OFFICIAL RELATIONS WITH GOV.  CURRENTLY, THE LINES OF 
COMMUNICATION ARE LIMITED TO THE ANNUAL HOLY SEE DELEGATION 
VISIT AND THROUGH THE GOV EMBASSY TO ITALY.  WHILE THE HOLY 
SEE GENERALLY PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON THE PROGRESS WITH THE 
GOV THIS YEAR, MIGLIORE HAD COMPLAINED BEFORE HIS TRIP THAT 
THEY WERE \"TIRED\" OF THE 50 PERCENT APPROACH BY THE GOV.  THE 
HOLY SEE APPRECIATES THE DEPARTMENT\'S FREEDOM OF RELIGION 
REPORT, WHICH THEY BELIEVE STRENGTHENS THEIR ABILITY TO 
CONTINUE PRESSING THE GOV FOR GREATER RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

DEVOTED TO ANTI-SEMITISM.  MIGLIORE RESPONDED THAT THE HOLY 
SEE WAS \"HESITANT\" TO ACCEPT THIS PROPOSAL, \"NOT BECAUSE WE 
ARE NOT CONVINCED OF THE NEED TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM.\" 
RATHER, THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT IF THE OSCE WERE TO HOLD A 
SPECIAL SESSION ON ANTI-SEMITISM, THE OSCE WOULD HAVE TO 
EXPLAIN WHY IT WAS NOT HOLDING SPECIAL SESSIONS ON THE ROMA, 
SINTI, AND OTHER GROUPS FACING RACISM OR XENOPHOBIA.  HE FELT 
THIS WOULD DILUTE THE STATEMENT CONDEMNING DISCRIMINATION 
THAT WOULD COME OUT OF OPORTO.  THE PROBLEM, MIGLIORE 
REITERATED, WAS THAT \"SOMEONE WILL ALWAYS SAY THAT THEIR 
SPECIFIC PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT, AND WE WILL INEVITABLY 
DISAPPOINT SOME GROUP.\" 
 
3. (SBU) DCM RESPONDED THAT THE USG REGARDS ANTI-SEMITISM AS 
A UNIQUE HISTORICAL PROBLEM THAT MERITS STAND-ALONE

STRENGTHEN THE OSCE\'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH OTHER FORMS OF 
RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA.  MIGLIORE RESPONDED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD

WELL-GROUNDED.  HE REITERATED HIS VIEW THAT THE OPORTO

BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ON PIETRO PAROLIN 
 
1.   (U) POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS APPOINTED MONSIGNOR PIETRO 
PAROLIN TO BE THE HOLY SEE\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER (UNDER- 
SECRETARY FOR THE SECTION FOR RELATIONS WITH STATES OF THE 
 
SIPDIS 
SECRETARIAT OF STATE).  PAROLIN REPLACES ARCHBISHOP- 
 
SIPDIS 
DESIGNATE CELESTINO MIGLIORE WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED THE HOLY 
SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER AT THE U.N. IN NEW YORK. 
 
2.   (U) PIETRO PAROLIN WAS BORN IN SCHIAVON, IN VICENZA 
PROVINCE, IN THE NORTH OF ITALY IN 1955.  AFTER HIS 
ORDINATION AS A CATHOLIC PRIEST HE TOOK UP GRADUATE STUDIES 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  05848  041550Z 
IN CANON LAW AND DIPLOMACY AND ENTERED THE HOLY SEE\'S 
DIPLOMATIC SERVICE IN 1986.  PAROLIN SERVED AT HOLY SEE 
NUNCIATURES IN NIGERIA AND MEXICO, AND MOST RECENTLY AS 
DIRECTOR FOR SPAIN, ANDORRA, ITALY, SAN MARINO AND CONCORDAT 
ISSUES AT THE VATICAN\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY.  HE SPEAKS 
ITALIAN, ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND SPANISH. 
 
3.   (SBU) PAROLIN WAS A 2001 INTERNATIONAL VISITOR TO THE 
UNITED STATES FROM THE VATICAN, AND HAS BEEN A GOOD CONTACT 
FOR POST.  WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH HIM IN HIS CAPACITY 
AS COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR INDONESIA DURING THE EAST TIMOR 
CRISIS.  HE HAS CONSISTENTLY PROVEN HIMSELF AN OPEN-MINDED 
\"VATICANISTA\" WHO HAS BEEN GROOMED FOR GREATER 
RESPONSIBILITY IN THE HOLY SEE.  HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN 
OBVIOUS CHOICE FOR A PAPAL NUNCIO -- A COMMON ONWARD 
ASSIGNMENT FOR VATICAN MFA COUNTRY DIRECTORS 
-- BUT WE SUSPECT HIS SUPERIOR ABILITIES, AS WELL AS PERHAPS 
FAMILY REASONS (WE KNOW HIS ELDERLY MOTHER\'S ILLNESS 
SLIGHTLY ABBREVIATED HIS IV PROGRAM), HAVE KEPT HIM AT THE 
VATICAN WHERE HE HAS NOW LEAP-FROGGED INTO A MORE SENIOR 
POSITION.  PAROLIN WILL LIKELY CARRY ON THE TRADITION OF 
FRIENDLINESS, OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS, AND OPEN-MINDEDNESS 
ESTABLISHED BY HIS PREDECESSOR, AND WILL BE AN EFFECTIVE 
HIGH-LEVEL INTERLOCUTOR FOR THE U.S.

SUMMARY

                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  05938  01 OF 02  111711Z 
1.  (C) HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINISTER ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS 
TAURAN CALLED IN AMBASSADOR NOVEMBER 27 TO CONVEY THE POPE\'S 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST, PARTICULARLY 
THE ISRAELI REOCCUPATION OF BETHLEHEM.  WITH THE CHRISTMAS 
SEASON APPROACHING, TAURAN SAID THE CURRENT CURFEW IN 
BETHLEHEM -- PROJECTED TO LAST THROUGH DECEMBER 30 BY SOME 
ISRAELI AUTHORITIES -- WOULD HAVE VERY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. 
HE INDICATED THAT IF THE CURFEW WAS NOT LIFTED AND ACCESS TO 
THE HOLY SITES GUARANTEED, THE POPE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO 
MAKE A STATEMENT SHARPLY CRITICAL OF ISRAEL FOR RESTRICTING 
THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION.  TAURAN WELCOMED THE PROPOSAL FOR A 
QUARTET MEETING IN WASHINGTON DECEMBER 20, ADDING THAT IT WAS 
TIME TO MOVE FROM ANALYSIS TO CONCRETE STEPS ON THE GROUND. 
HE ALSO APPLAUDED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S DECISION NOT TO MOVE THE 
U.S. EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, WHICH HE SAID WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
CAUSE OF \"GREAT DISTURBANCE.\"  ON IRAQ, TAURAN TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR THE HOLY SEE HAD SENT A MESSAGE TO THE IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT REITERATING THEIR BELIEF THAT SADDAM MUST MEET HIS 
UN COMMITMENTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
POPE WANTS END TO CURFEW, ENSURE CHRISTMAS ACCESS TO HOLY 
SITES 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (C) ARCHBISHOP TAURAN TOLD THE AMBASSADOR NOVEMBER 27 THAT 
THE POPE WAS PERSONALLY DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE MOST 
RECENT ISRAELI INCURSION INTO BETHLEHEM AND THE IMPLICATIONS 
OF THE ONGOING CURFEW THERE FOR THE UPCOMING CHRISTMAS 
SEASON.  WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT ISRAEL HAD PULLED BACK ITS 
TANKS FROM AROUND THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY, TAURAN SAID 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  05938  01 OF 02  111711Z 
BETHLEHEM REMAINED UNDER A STRICT CURFEW THAT HAD SERIOUS 
IMPLICATIONS FOR TRADITIONAL CHRISTMAS EVENTS AT THE HOLY 
SITES.  HE UNDERSTOOD THAT SOME ISRAELI AUTHORITIES HAD 
SUGGESTED THE CURFEW COULD LAST UNTIL DECEMBER 30. 
RHETORICALLY ASKING, \"WHAT ABOUT CHRISTMAS,\" TAURAN SAID THAT 
IF THE CURFEW WERE TO CONTINUE THROUGH THAT TIME, THE POPE 
WOULD FEEL COMPELLED TO ISSUE A STATEMENT CRITICAL OF THE 
ISRAELIS FOR \"RESTRICTING FREEDOM OF RELIGION.\"  THE HOLY SEE 
RECOGNIZED THAT SUCH A STATEMENT WOULD BE LIKELY TO PROVOKE A 
POINTED ISRAELI REACTION, AND WOULD STRONGLY PREFER THAT 
STEPS BE TAKEN TO AVOID THIS SCENARIO.  TAURAN SAID HE HOPED 
THE U.S. COULD WORK WITH ISRAEL TO AVOID ANY PROBLEMS DURING 
THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON. 
 
3. (C) THE AMBASSADOR AGREED TO CONVEY TAURAN\'S CONCERNS TO 
WASHINGTON.  HE NOTED THAT ISRAEL WAS CERTAINLY SEEKING TO 
AVOID A REOCCURRENCE OF THE OCCUPATION OF THE CHURCH OF THE 
NATIVITY, AND ASKED TAURAN WHETHER THEY PERCEIVED A RISK THAT 
THE PALESTINIANS MIGHT SEEK TO CREATE TROUBLE IN THE HOLY 
SITES.  TAURAN SAID HE DOUBTED THE PALESTINIANS WOULD OCCUPY 
THE CHURCH AT THIS TIME, BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL BACKLASH 
WOULD BE TOO GREAT. 
 
--------------------------------- 
QUARTET:  TIME FOR CONCRETE STEPS 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD TAURAN THAT THE QUARTET WOULD BE 
MEETING IN WASHINGTON DECEMBER 20 TO CONTINUE WORKING ON A 
ROADMAP TOWARD ACHIEVING THE PRESIDENT\'S VISION OF A 
TWO-STATE SOLUTION.  HE NOTED THAT CONTINUED VIOLENCE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  05938  01 OF 02  111711Z 
THREATENED TO DERAIL THESE EFFORTS, AND THAT PALESTINIAN AND 
ISRAELI RESTRAINT WAS NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY 
SITUATION, ACHIEVE REFORMS, AND ALLEVIATE THE HUMANITARIAN 
SITUATION.  TAURAN WELCOMED THE CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT OF THE 
QUARTET, BUT SAID \"THE TIME HAD ARRIVED TO MOVE FROM ANALYSIS 
TO CONCRETE STEPS.\"  HE ALSO REPEATED HIS LONG-STANDING VIEW 
THAT AN INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING OR MONITORING PRESENCE ON 
THE GROUND IS NEEDED TO END THE SPIRAL OF VIOLENCE.  ONLY 
SUCH A PRESENCE, HE EXPLAINED, WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHO 
WAS VIOLATING AGREEMENTS.  PRESSED ON THE COMPOSITION OF SUCH 
A FORCE, TAURAN SAID THAT WAS NOT A MATTER ON WHICH THE HOLY 
SEE COULD COMMENT.  TAURAN ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER A 
RECENT STATEMENT OF PM SHARON DENYING THE POTENTIAL FOR TWO 
STATES.

HOLY SEE HAD RECENTLY SENT A MESSAGE TO IRAQ MAKING CLEAR 
THEIR BELIEF THAT SADDAM NEEDED TO ABIDE BY THE UN 
RESOLUTIONS AND ALLOW THE INSPECTORS FULL ACCESS TO POTENTIAL 
WMD SITES.  THE AMBASSADOR ASSURED TAURAN THAT THE U.S. DID 
NOT WANT WAR, BUT THAT IT WAS UP TO IRAQ TO ASSURE THE WORLD 
THAT IT HAD DISARMED AS REQUIRED.  TAURAN ACKNOWLEDGED THIS, 
BUT STRESSED THAT WAR WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR 
THE REGION, AND WOULD LIKELY INCREASE THE \"APPETITE FOR 
TERROR\" AMONG RADICALS IN THE REGION.

7. (C) FOLLOWING THE DISASTROUS OCCUPATION OF THE CHURCH OF

ENSURE THAT THE CHURCH DOES NOT AGAIN BECOME CAUGHT IN THE 
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CROSS-FIRE.  EVER CONSCIOUS OF THE 
SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE OF THE HOLY SITES, THE POPE WOULD SEE 
ISRAELI RESTRICTIONS THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON AS A SYMBOL OF 
CONTINUED HIGH-HANDEDNESS AND CAN BE EXPECTED TO BE SHARPLY 
CRITICAL IF THE CURFEW WOULD MAR THE HOLY SEASON.  ANY 
ASSURANCE WE COULD PROVIDE THE HOLY SEE THAT WE ARE

BEING ALONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT CHAIRMAN\'S TEXT, AND 
SUGGESTED THAT THIS \"BLOCKAGE\" WOULD \"RESULT IN SERIOUS HARM\" 
TO MILLIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AT RISK FROM HIV/AIDS, 
MALARIA, TUBERCULOSIS, AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES, WHILE 
ALSO DAMAGING A RULES-BASED TRADE SYSTEM.  EMBASSY 
UNDERSTANDS THAT HOLY SEE PERMANENT OBSERVER TO THE WTO, 
DIARMUD MARTIN RAISED THIS CONCERN WITH THE SECRETARIAT OF

AMBASSADOR HAS ALSO RECEIVED A REQUEST FROM VATICAN-BASED 
MEDIA TO COMMENT ON THE U.S. POSITION IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS. 
PER REF DISCUSSION, EMBASSY WILL DEFER PUBLIC COMMENT UNTIL 
AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF CURRENT ROUND OF TALKS DECEMBER 20. 
WE WILL ALSO CONVEY TO THE HOLY SEE OUR STRONG DESIRE TO 
ENSURE LIBERAL LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THOSE MEDICINES 
RELATING TO HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, MALARIA AND OTHER 
INFECTIOUS EPIDEMICS OF SIMILAR GRAVITY CITED BY THE HOLY SEE

THE HOLY SEE HAS LEARNED WITH CONCERN OF THE BLOCKAGE OF 
NEGOTIATIONS AT THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE WORLD TRADE 
ORGANIZATION (WTO) ON THE QUESTION OF TRIP\'S AND PUBLIC 
HEALTH. 
 
THE DOHA DECLARATION ON THIS ISSUE WAS HAILED AT THE TIME BY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  06064  191322Z 
ALL SIDES AS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN RECONCILING THE 
PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES AND THE 
IMPORTANT BENEFITS WHICH CAN COME FROM A RULES-BASED 
INTERNATIONAL REGIME FOR THE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY RIGHTS. 
 
THE AGREEMENTS AT DOHA FORESAW THAT A DEFINITIVE DECISION ON 
THIS QUESTION SHOULD BE TAKEN BY THE END OF THIS YEAR 2002. 
 
THE HOLY SEE HAS ALSO LEARNED THAT NOW THE UNITED STATES 
SEEMS TO STAND ALONE IN ITS OPPOSITION TO THE TEXT THAT HAS 
BEEN PATIENTLY NEGOTIATED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE TRIP\'S 
COUNCIL. 
 
A FAILURE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT BY THE TIME-LIMIT INDICATED 
RUNS THE SERIOUS RISK THAT ENTIRE NEGOTIATION WOULD COLLAPSE. 
IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT TO \"FREEZE\" THE CURRENT AGREED TEXT 
FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT PERIOD INTO THE NEW YEAR. 
 
THE FAILURE TO REACH A CONSENSUS WOULD RESULT IN SERIOUS 
HARM, ESPECIALLY TO MILLIONS OF PERSONS IN DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES WHO ARE MOST EXPOSED TO HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS AND 
MALARIA, AND TO OTHER POSSIBLE SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. 
 
SUCH A FAILURE, IN THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD RESULT 
INEVITABLY IN DAMAGE TO A RULES-BASED INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
SYSTEM, SOMETHING WHICH IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THE 
UNITED STATES.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PRESSES VATICAN DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES 
FOR SUPPORT ON AFRICAN FAMINE AND BIOTECH FEARS 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR HOSTED A MEETING ON THE AFRICA 
FAMINE AND U.S. BIOTECH RELIEF FOOD DECEMBER 18 FOR THIRTY 
HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES FROM EUROPE, AFRICA, ASIA, 
AND LATIN AMERICA.  WORLD FOOD PROGRAM DEPUTY EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR JEAN JACQUES GRAISSE, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO FODAG 
TONY HALL, AND ITALIAN GENETICIST FROM THE ITALIAN NATIONAL 
RESEARCH CENTER IN NAPLES DR. ROBERTO DEFEZ BRIEFED THE 
HOLY SEE AMBASSADORS ON THE STATE OF THE AFRICAN FAMINE AND 
URGED THEM TO WORK BOTH WITH THEIR CAPITALS AND WITH THE 
HOLY SEE TO DEVELOP MORE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF.  ALL 
PRESENTERS, INCLUDING AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON, OFFERED CLEAR 
AND COMPELLING COMMENTARY ON THE NEED TO DO MORE TO RESPOND 
TO THIS CRISIS AND EMPHASIZED THE SAFETY OF US FOOD.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  WFP DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JEAN JACQUES GRAISSE LAID 
OUT THE FOOD NEEDS FOR AFRICA OVER THE COMING MONTHS, 
FOCUSING ON THE FOLLY OF REFUSING TO ACCEPT \"COMPLETELY 
SAFE\" U.S. FOOD.  HE TERMED THIS \"THE MOST ABSURD 
SITUATION\" HE HAD SEEN IN A CAREER OF RELIEF WORK. 
AMBASSADOR HALL REVIEWED HIS RECENT MISSION TO AFRICA AND 
URGED THE AMBASSADORS TO GET THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO STEP UP 
THEIR ASSISTANCE LEVELS, BOTH OF COMMODITIES AND OF CASH. 
HE UNDERSCORED THE MORAL ISSUES AT HAND, AND NOTED THAT HOW 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  06141  010934Z 
POLITICAL LEADERS RESPOND -- BOTH IN FAMINE-STRUCK 
COUNTRIES AND DONOR COUNTRIES, WILL BE HELD IN JUDGMENT BY 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  DR. DEFEZ\' PRESENTATION 
UNDERSCORED BOTH THE RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE SAFETY OF 
BIOTECH FOODS WHEN COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC 
FOODS.  DEFEZ ALSO EXPLAINED THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
INNOCUOUSNESS OF BIOTECH CROPS, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS \"WEAK 
COMPETITORS IN A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.\" 
 
3.  THE HOLY SEE AMBASSADORS\' COMMENTS WERE GENERALLY 
POSITIVE, WITH THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR NOTING THAT THE 
AFRICAN FAMINE HAS SEIZED THE ATTENTION OF THE EU, WHICH 
WILL DEVOTE OVER 100 MILLION EURO TO IT IN COMING MONTHS. 
THE GREEK AMBASSADOR QUESTIONED WHETHER AFRICAN OPPOSITION 
TO US FOOD WAS \"POLITICAL\" (WE TOLD HIM IT WAS ROOTED IN 
FEAR OF EU REACTIONS, NOT FEAR THAT THE FOOD WAS AMERICAN). 
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR LICARI, AN OLD AFRICA HAND, EXPRESSED 
HIS COUNTRY\'S FRUSTRATION WITH THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT\'S 
DECISION TO REFUSE US FOOD ASSISTANCE, BUT TOLD THE 
ASSEMBLED GUESTS THAT MORE AFRICAN VOICES NEEDED TO BE 
HEARD.  HE SAID THE US NEEDED TO ENGAGE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE 
\"INFORMATION CAMPAIGN\" TO EDUCATE AFRICAN LEADERS ABOUT US 
FOOD.  THE DUTCH AMBASSADOR\'S WIFE LATER REPORTED TO MRS. 
NICHOLSON THAT HER HUSBAND THOUGHT THE MEETING WAS THE MOST 
MEANINGFUL TWO HOURS HE HAD SPENT IN HIS ENTIRE DIPLOMATIC 
CAREER. 
 
4.  COMMENT:  IN BRINGING TOGETHER THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, WE 
HAVE SOUGHT TO STIMULATE OUR DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES TO 
GREATER AWARENESS AND ACTIVITY VIS-A-VIS THE AFRICA FAMINE 
AND STEP UP INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON THE HOLY SEE TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  06141  010934Z 
ABANDON THE CAUTION THAT HAS CHARACTERIZED ITS POSITION ON 
THE SAFETY OF US FOOD ASSISTANCE TO DATE.  MOST OF THE 
AMBASSADORS/CHARGES TOOK DETAILED NOTES, AND MANY INDICATED 
THEY WOULD REPORT U.S. CONCERNS BACK TO CAPITALS.  WE HAVE 
PRESSED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS THE DEAN OF THE VATICAN 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS (FROM SAN MARINO) TO MAKE THIS ISSUE A 
THEME OF HIS ANNUAL GREETING TO THE POPE ON JANUARY 13. 
THE POPE\'S RESPONSE, WHICH IS PICKED UP BY MEDIA ALL OVER 
THE WORLD, COULD VERY WELL PROVIDE AMMUNITION TO USE WITH 
BISHOPS CONFERENCES AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE CHURCH THAT 
HAVE BEEN UNHELPFUL ON THE BIOTECH MESSAGE IN RECENT 
MONTHS.

RECONCILIATION EFFORTS IN THE REGION.  IN BOSNIA THE 
DELEGATION MET WITH THE CATHOLIC, MUSLIM AND JEWISH MEMBERS 
OF THE B-H INTER-RELIGIOUS COUNCIL (IRC) WHO ADMITTED 
CONTINUING CHALLENGES IN FORGING RECONCILIATION IN BOSNIA; 
CATHOLIC CARDINAL PULJIC FOCUSED ON NEED FOR REFUGEES TO BE 
ABLE TO RETURN \"WITH DIGNITY.\"  AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON ALSO 
BROKE AWAY FOR A BRIEF MEETING WITH FRANCISCAN FRIAR DZOLAN 
TO DISCUSS THE FRANCISCANS\' ATTITUDE TOWARD RECONCILIATION. 
IN KOSOVO, THE DELEGATION VISITED AN EMBASSY VATICAN- 
SPONSORED PROJECT FOR INTER-ETHNIC RECONCILIATION RUN BY THE 
SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY.  CHILDREN STUDYING IN THE \"SCHOOL OF 
PEACE\" AT THE PRIZREN ALBANIAN NORMAL SCHOOL DEMONSTRATED AN 
UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORICAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS THE HOLOCAUST 
AND THE US CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND CLEARLY ENJOYED EACH 
OTHER\'S COMPANY.  THE NEXT STEP IN PRIZREN SHOULD BE TO 
INCORPORATE SERB CHILDREN IN THE PROGRAM ALONG WITH THE 
KOSOVAR ALBANIANS AND TURKS AND THE BOSNIACS CURRENTLY 
INVOLVED.  THE TRIP CONCLUDED WITH A LUNCH HOSTED BY COMKFOR 
LTG MINI, WHO HAS URGED THE CATHOLIC BISHOP OF PRIZREN TO 
PROMOTE SERB RETURNS AND ASKED EMBASSY VATICAN TO WORK WITH 
THE USG TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE BISHOP TO DO SO. END SUMMARY.

BALKANS DECEMBER 19-20, TO MEET WITH RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
WORKING FOR RECONCILIATION IN BOSNIA, AND TO VISIT AN 
EMBASSY VATICAN-SPONSORED RECONCILIATION PROJECT IN PRIZREN, 
YUGOSLAVIA.  IN SARAJEVO AMBASSADOR BOND AND EMBASSY 
SARAJEVO TEAM BRIEFED THE DELEGATION, NOTING THE GOOD 
PROGRESS THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS HAD MADE IN DRAFTING A LAW ON 
RELIGIONS (NOTE: OUR VATICAN CONTACTS BELIEVE THIS DRAFT LAW 
PROVIDES \"EXCELLENT GUARANTEES\").  BRIEFERS NOTED THAT 
PROBLEMS AMONG THE MOSTLY CATHOLIC CROATS CONTINUE, WITH THE 
VATICAN RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON THE MORE NATIONALISTIC ELEMENTS 
OF ITS OWN CLERGY IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA.  THE CROAT 
COMMUNITY HAS DEVELOPED A \"MINORITY COMPLEX\" AND THROWS UP 
ITS OWN OBSTACLES TO CROAT REFUGEE RETURNS BY INSISTING THAT 
ALL MUNICIPAL SERVICES BE REBUILT BEFORE RETURNS CAN OCCUR. 
CARDINAL PULJIC HAS GREAT CREDIBILITY FROM WEATHERING THE 
WAR IN SARAJEVO, BUT HE SHARES THIS \"COMPLEX.\"  THE CLERGY 
NEED TO LET DOWN THEIR GUARD AND TAKE THE LEAD IN PROMOTING 
INTER-RELIGIOUS RECONCILIATION.  KEY MEASURES TO TAKE EARLY 
ON WOULD BE PROMOTING VISITS TO EACH OTHER\'S PLACES OF 
WORSHIP, AND WORKING TOGETHER ON A SCHOOL CURRICULUM. 
 
3.  AMBASSADOR BOND, ADMIRAL JOHNSON, AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON 
AND STAFF THEN MET WITH THREE OF THE FOUR RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
IN SARAJEVO -- CATHOLIC CARDINAL PULIC, MUSLIM MUFTI CERIC, 
AND JEWISH COMMUNITY LEADER DR. JAKOB FINCI.  THE SERB 
ORTHODOX COMMUNITY WAS NOT REPRESENTED BECAUSE METROPOLITAN 
NIKOLAJ HAD OTHER COMMITMENTS.  CERIC EXPRESSED THE GROUP\'S 
GRATITUDE TO THE US FOR HELPING END THE WAR AND BRINGING 
SECURITY TO BOSNIA. HE WAS POSITIVE ON THE DRAFT LAW ON 
RELIGIONS, NOTING IT WAS NOW BEFORE THE B-H ASSEMBLY.  BOTH 
CERIC AND FINCI SPOKE FRANKLY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES STILL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  06156  01 OF 02  301354Z 
FACING THE IRC, IN PARTICULAR DIFFICULTIES RESTORING 
PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPING A COMMON PROPOSAL FOR RELIGIOUS 
EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.  BOTH NOTED BOSNIA\'S LONG 
TRADITION OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE AS A SOURCE OF HOPE FOR THE 
FUTURE EVEN AS THEY DECRIED BOSNIAN POLITICAL LEADERS\' 
DEMAGOGUERY ON RELIGIOUS IDENTIFICATION.  PULJIC SAID THERE 
WAS NO ALTERNATIVE TO DIALOGUE AND ADMITTED THERE WAS MUCH 
WORK YET TO BE DONE BEFORE BOSNIA COULD EMBARK ON A PATH 
TOWARD \"EUROPE.\"  PULIC EMPHASIZED, AS PREDICTED, THE NEED 
FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND FOR REFUGEES TO BE ABLE TO 
RETURN TO THEIR ORIGINAL ABODES \"NOT AS PAUPERS, BUT WITH 
DIGNITY.\"  ADMIRAL JOHNSON AND AMBASSADOR BOND AND 
AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON URGED THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO EXERCISE 
LEADERSHIP. ALL THREE FOCUSED ON THE NEED FOR THE IRC TO DO 
MORE OUTSIDE OF SARAJEVO AND TO SHOW THE WORLD AN EXAMPLE OF 
INTERFAITH RECONCILIATION AND COOPERATION. 
 
4.  AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON BROKE AWAY FOR A SHORT MEETING WITH 
FRANCISCAN FRIAR MIJO DZOLAN, WHO, UNLIKE HIS CROAT 
FRANCISCAN BROTHERS IN AND AROUND MOSTAR, HAS A STRONG TRACK 
RECORD OF PROMOTING INTER-ETHNIC UNITY IN BOSNIA.  HE

SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY.  WITH A USD 60,000 GRANT FROM PD/ECA, 
SANT\'EGIDIO (A LAY CATHOLIC COMMUNITY THAT FOCUSES ON 
DEVELOPMENT AND RECONCILIATION IN AFRICA AND THE BALKANS) 
DEVELOPED AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM THAT TRAINS 
TEACHERS AND PROVIDES MATERIALS TO TEACH RECONCILIATION 
TECHNIQUES.  THE CHILDREN STUDYING IN THE \"SCHOOL OF PEACE\" 
AT THE PRIZREN NORMAL SCHOOL SANG AND READ THEIR OWN TEXTS, 
DEMONSTRATING AN UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORICAL PHENOMENA SUCH 
AS THE HOLOCAUST AND THE U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THE 
CHILDREN CLEARLY ENJOYED EACH OTHER\'S COMPANY, OFFERING HOPE 
FOR THE YOUNG GENERATION T OVERCOME THEIR PARENTS\' 
HOSTILITY.  WE NOTED, HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF SERB CHILDREN. 
PER REF EMAIL, THE NEXT STEP IN PRIZREN SHOULD BE TO 
INCORPORATE SERB CHILDREN IN THE PROGRAM ALONG WITH THE 
ALBANIANS, TURKS AND THE BOSNIACS CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN THE

6.  THE TRIP CONCLUDED WITH A LUNCH HOSTED BY COMKFOR LTG

NATIONAL COMMANDERS FROM THE ITALIAN, FRENCH AND GERMAN KFOR 
CONTINGENTS.  GENERAL MINI HAD VISITED WITH CATHOLIC BISHOP

PRIZREN). GENERAL MINI TOLD US HE HAD URGED BISHOP SOPI TO 
INVOLVE HIMSELF MORE PUBLICLY IN PROMOTING SERB RETURNS.

STAFFS, AND BY THE STAFF AT USOP.  WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH 
THE HOLY SEE TO URGE GREATER ENGAGEMENT TO PROMOTE 
RECONCILIATION IN BOTH BOSNIA AND KOSOVO.  POPE JOHN PAUL II 
IS PREOCCUPIED WITH A POSSIBLE CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS 
DEVELOPING FROM THE U.S.-LED WAR ON TERRORISM, THUS THE HOLY 
SEE WILL WANT TO DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO ENSURE THAT 
RECONCILIATION MAKES PROGRESS IN THE BALKANS AS A POSITIVE 
EXAMPLE TO THE WORLD.  AS DISCUSSED WITH EMBASSY SARAJEVO 
AND USOP, WE WILL BROACH WITH THE VATICAN THE POSSIBILITY OF

1. (U) THE POPE AND SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS HAVE LAUNCHED AN 
END OF YEAR \"PEACE OFFENSIVE\" WITH A SERIES OF STATEMENTS AND 
MESSAGES AIMED AT COUNTERING THE PERCEPTION THAT WAR IN IRAQ 
IS INEVITABLE.  THESE MESSAGES HAVE ALSO URGED THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PURSUE ALL POSSIBLE STEPS TO AVOID 
WAR.  IN HIS NEW YEAR\'S HOMILY, THE POPE EMPHASIZED THAT 
\"PEACE IS POSSIBLE AND A DUTY,\" WHILE AT CHRISTMAS, HE CALLED 
ON ALL BELIEVERS TO \"EXTINGUISH THE OMINOUS SMOLDERING OF A 
CONFLICT WHICH, WITH THE JOINT EFFORTS OF ALL, CAN BE 
AVOIDED.\"  ALTHOUGH THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED 
SUBSTANTIVELY FROM ITS PREVIOUS POSITION (REFTELS) THAT WAR 
COULD BE JUSTIFIED IF THE UN DETERMINES MILITARY ACTION 
NECESSARY AND ALL OTHER MEANS OF AVOIDING CONFLICT ARE 
EXHAUSTED, RECENT STATEMENTS HAVE HAD GREATER URGENCY AND A 
SHARPER TONE, SUGGESTING THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD LIKELY 
CONDEMN ANY ACTION THAT OCCURRED WITHOUT UN AUTHORIZATION OR 
WITHOUT ALLOWING THE INSPECTION PROCESS TO RUN ITS COURSE. 
THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO REJECT THE NOTION OF A PRE-EMPTIVE 
WAR, ASSERTING THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO \"THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE\" 
WITH EVERY COUNTRY BEING EMPOWERED TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION 
TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS WITH NEIGHBORS OR ENEMIES.  THE POPE HAS 
ALSO REPEATEDLY SPOKEN OUT ABOUT THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN 
CONFLICT, WITH BALANCED CALLS FOR AN END TO THE SPIRAL OF 
BLIND VIOLENCE AND SUFFERING OF ALL THE PEOPLES IN THE

2. (U) TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE \'BULLY PULPIT\' AFFORDED 
THE POPE BY THE MANY HOLIDAY SEASON MASSES AND MESSAGES HEARD 
BY MILLIONS WORLDWIDE, HE AND SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS HAVE 
BEEN ACTIVELY PUSHING A \'MESSAGE OF PEACE\' TO COUNTER 
ACCEPTANCE OF THE INEVITABILITY OF WAR IN IRAQ AND OF 
CONTINUED VIOLENCE IN ISRAEL AND PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. 
ACCORDING TO ARCHBISHOP RENATO MARTINO, NEWLY APPOINTED HEAD 
OF THE COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE, THE POPE IS \"GENUINELY 
VERY CONCERNED BY THE EVENTS THAT COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE 
NEAR FUTURE.\"  ACCORDING TO MARTINO, THE POPE IS DOING 
\"EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO AVOID A DETERIORATION IN THE 
SITUATION THAT COULD END IN CONFLICT.\" BEGINNING WITH HIS 
CHRISTMAS DAY \"URBI ET ORBI\" ADDRESS, TELEVISED IN OVER 50 
COUNTRIES, THE POPE APPEALED TO THE WORLD \"NOT TO YIELD TO 
MISTRUST, SUSPICION, AND DISCOURAGEMENT, EVEN AS THE TRAGIC 
REALITY OF TERRORISM FEEDS UNCERTAINTIES AND FEARS.\"  HE 
FURTHER CALLED ON BELIEVERS AND MEN OF GOODWILL TO 
\"EXTINGUISH THE OMINOUS SMOLDERING OF A CONFLICT WHICH, WITH 
THE JOINT EFFORTS OF ALL CAN BE AVOIDED.\" 
 
3. (U) AT THE NEW YEAR\'S MASS, THE POPE CALLED FOR PEACEFUL 
MEANS TO OVERCOME INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS, STATING THAT 
\"BEFORE THE CONFLICTS OF THE DAY AND THE THREATENING TENSIONS 
OF THE MOMENT, ONCE AGAIN I INVITE ALL TO PRAY SO THAT 
PEACEFUL MEANS OF AGREEMENT WILL BE SOUGHT...IN HARMONY WITH 
INTERNATIONAL LAW.\"  HE EMPHASIZED THAT \"DESPITE SERIOUS AND 
REPEATED ATTACKS AGAINST THE SERENE AND SHARED COEXISTENCE OF

U.S. ACTION, INSISTING THAT \"IT CANNOT BE THAT A MEMBER OF

YOU WILL HELP ME, OTHERWISE, STAY AT HOME.\'\"  IF THIS WERE TO 
HAPPEN, TAURAN CAUTIONED, \"THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL 
RULES WOULD CRUMBLE, AND ONE WOULD RISK THE LAW OF THE 
JUNGLE.\"  INEVITABLY, IN HIS VIEW, INDIVIDUAL STATES HAVING 
DISPUTES WITH OTHER STATES WOULD, USING THE SAME LOGIC, 
DECIDE THAT THEY WOULD \"PUT THINGS IN ORDER\" UNILATERALLY. 
JUSTICE AND PEACE\'S MARTINO ALSO CAUTIONED AGAINST 
UNILATERALISM RECENTLY, OBSERVING THAT \"WE SHOULD REJECT 
UNILATERALISM, AS WELL AS THE IDEA OF A WORLD POLICEMAN.\" 
BOTH MARTINO AND FM TAURAN HAVE SPOKEN OF THE VALUE OF A 
\"MODERATING\" EUROPEAN INFLUENCE, AIMED AT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF 
ALL THE MEANS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND OFFERING ALL MEDIATION 
POSSIBLE TO PREVENT WAR.  TAURAN CITED A COMMON CONVICTION IN 
HIS CONTACTS WITH EUROPEAN AND ARAB LEADERS THAT \"WAR IS NOT 
THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM.\"  IN THIS REGARD, HE CITED WHAT IS

BUT RECOGNIZING LEGITIMACY OF ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6. (SBU) DESPITE THE PEACE OFFENSIVE, WHICH THE MEDIA HAS 
WIDELY HAILED AS A SIGN THAT THE HOLY SEE WILL OPPOSE ANY 
ACTION AGAINST IRAQ, THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION REMAINS MORE 
NUANCED THAN OFTEN PORTRAYED IN THE ITALIAN AND INTERNATIONAL 
MEDIA.  IN FACT, EVEN AS TAURAN REJECTED THE IDEA OF A 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

UNILATERAL PREVENTIVE WAR, HE DID NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY 
OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION \"IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, 
DRAWING ON INTERNATIONAL LAW AND IN PARTICULAR RESOLUTIONS OF 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL, DETERMINED THAT OPPORTUNE AND 
PROPORTIONATE RECOURSE TO FORCE.\"  THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE 
HOLY SEE\'S VIEW THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE 
MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR POTENTIAL IRAQI FAILINGS TO 
RESPECT THE WILL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

--------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) THE RECENT REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF THE U.S. USING NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN RESPONSE TO 
A WMD ATTACK AGAINST THE U.S. EVOKED A HARSH REBUKE FROM 
TAURAN, WHO SAID \"IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO EVEN ECHO THIS 
HYPOTHESIS, AS IT SEEMS SO MONSTROUS TO ME.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
SITUATION IN THE HOLY LANDS CONTINUES TO WEIGH ON POPE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
8. (U) THE POPE\'S PEACE MESSAGE WAS NOT ONLY FOCUSED ON IRAQ, 
BUT ALSO ON WHAT HE TERMED \"THE SENSELESS SPIRAL OF BLIND 
VIOLENCE\" IN THE HOLY LAND.  SPEAKING ON THE SITUATION IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST IN HIS WORLD DAY OF PEACE MESSAGE JANUARY 1, THE 
POPE OBSERVED THAT \"THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF BITTER MUTUAL 
REJECTION AND AN UNENDING CHAIN OF VIOLENCE AND RETALIATION 
HAVE SHATTERED EVERY EFFORT THUS FAR TO ENGAGE IN SERIOUS 
DIALOGUE ON THE REAL ISSUES INVOLVED.\"  THE POPE SAID IT

PAGE 04        VATICA  00059  02 OF 03  081342Z 
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF PROGRESS UNTIL THOSE IN 
POSITIONS OF POWER BEGIN TO USE THEIR POWER TO IMPLEMENT 
POLICIES BASED ON RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. 
 FM TAURAN REITERATED THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION ON THE 
\"THE MOTHER OF ALL CONFLICTS\" REMAINS: RESPECT FOR THE OTHER 
AND HIS LEGITIMATE ASPIRATIONS, WITHDRAWAL FROM THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES, PRESENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON THE 
GROUND, AND INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES FOR THE HOLY SITES.

OFFERS A NATURAL FOCUS FOR THE HOLY SEE TO PROMOTE ITS 
PREFERRED VISION OF A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE IRAQ CRISIS.

 1. (C) SUMMARY: VATICAN COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR CARIBBEAN 
STATES MONS. GIORGIO LINGUA TOLD POLOFF JANUARY 7 THAT THE 
HOLY SEE\'S MAIN CONCERN IN VENEZUELA IS TO SEE TENSIONS 
REDUCED AND THE PARTIES WORKING TOWARDS AN AUGUST 2003 
REFERENDUM, AS PERMITTED BY THE VENEZUELAN CONSTITUTION.  THE 
VENEZUELAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE\'S DECEMBER 2002 STATEMENT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00105  01 OF 02  101650Z 
SUGGESTS THAT THE CHURCH IN VENEZUELA, AFTER THE SHOOTINGS ON 
PLAYA FRANCIA DE ALTAMYRA, IS PULLING BACK ITS PREVIOUS 
STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION IN ORDER TO HELP AVOID A 
VIOLENT DENOUEMENT. THE HOLY SEE IS OPEN TO A \"FRIENDS OF 
VENEZUELA\" PROCESS ONLY IF IT IS MADE A PART OF GAVIRIAS\' 
BRIEF (ASSUMING THAT LULA DA SILVA WOULD HAVE A MODERATING 
EFFECT ON CHAVEZ).  LINGUA WAS UNSURE WHETHER THE HOLY SEE 
WOULD URGE THE PARTIES TO ASK GAVIRIAS TO TABLE A CONCRETE 
PROPOSAL.  WHILE THE HOLY SEE APPEARS TO BE IN CLOSE CONTACT 
WITH BOTH THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS AND ITS NUNCIO, ITS ABILITY 
TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THEIR POSITIONS IS LIMITED.  EMBASSY 
CARACAS MAY WISH TO WORK WITH PAPAL NUNCIO DUPUY IN ADVANCE 
OF HIS ANNUAL GREETING TO PRESIDENT CHAVEZ AS DEAN OF THE 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS, TO MAKE SURE HE IS ON MESSAGE. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  POLOFF SHARED REF A POINTS ON THE VENEZUELAN CRISIS 
JANUARY 8 WITH VATICAN CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONS. 
GIORGIO LINGUA.  LINGUA SAID THE HOLY SEE\'S WAS VERY 
CONCERNED AT THE INCREASE IN CIVIL STRIFE SINCE WE LAST SPOKE 
(REF B).  HE INDICATED THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE\'S 
DECEMBER 2002 STATEMENT SHOWED THAT THE CHURCH, AFTER THE 
SHOOTINGS ON PLAYA FRANCIA DE ALTAMYRA, WAS BACKING AWAY FROM 
ITS PREVIOUS STRONG AND OPEN SUPPORT FOR THE OPPOSITION. 
LANGUAGE IN THAT STATEMENT WHICH HIGHLIGHTED THE CONTINUED 
SUFFERING OF VENEZUELA\'S POOREST, HOWEVER, WAS NOT AN ATTEMPT 
TO BUILD BRIDGES TO CHAVEZ.  RATHER, ACCORDING TO LINGUA, IT 
INDICATED THE BISHOPS WERE TRYING TO ATTRACT CHAVEZ 
SUPPORTERS AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT. INDEED THE STATEMENT 
CALLED ON MEDIA, THE GOVERNMENT AND SECURITY FORCES TO AVOID 
INFLAMING THE SITUATION.  IT EXHORTED THE GOVERNMENT TO 
ENSURE HUMAN RIGHTS AND ESCHEW \"STANDING ON LEGALISMS AND 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00105  01 OF 02  101650Z 
POLITICAL STRATEGIES\" THAT THREATEN THE SOCIAL FABRIC.    THE 
HOLY SEE REMAINS FEARFUL THAT, IN THE BISHOPS\' WORDS, A 
VIOLENT \"SOCIAL FRACTURE\" REMAINS A GREATER POSSIBILITY TODAY 
THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE GENERAL STRIKE.  YET THE HOLY SEE HAS 
NO PLANS AT THIS TIME ACTIVELY TO ENGAGE IN THE DIALOGUE. 
LINGUA REITERATED HIS MESSAGE FROM REF B, THAT THE HOLY SEE 
HOPED ALL PARTIES WOULD CALM DOWN AND ORGANIZE POLITICALLY TO 
CONTEST A REFERENDUM ON THE CHAVEZ PRESIDENCY IN AUGUST OF 
THIS YEAR, AS IS PERMITTED IN THE VENEZUELAN CONSTITUTION. 
LINGUA OPINED THAT CHAVEZ WAS LOSING SUPPORT AS THE STRIKE 
PROCEEDED (EVEN AS THE STRIKE APPEARED TO BE WINDING DOWN), 
AND THAT OVER THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND AUGUST THE 
OPPOSITION\'S ABILITY TO CARRY THE REFERENDUM WOULD GROW. 
 
3.  (C) LINGUA SAID THE VATICAN WAS OPEN TO A \"FRIENDS OF 
VENEZUELA\" PROCESS ONLY IF IT WAS MADE A PART OF GAVIRIAS\' 
BRIEF, BUT WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE A FRIENDS GROUP IF IT 
COMPETED (AND THUS DISTRACTED) FROM THE OAS ENVOY\'S WORK.  HE 
BELIEVED THAT BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT LULA DA SILVA MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO EXERCISE A MODERATING INFLUENCE ON CHAVEZ.  LINGUA WAS 
UNSURE WHETHER THE HOLY SEE WOULD ISSUE A PUBLIC CALL TO 
SUPPORT GAVIRIAS\' WORK.  HE WAS ALSO NONCOMMITTAL ABOUT HOLY 
SEE ENGAGEMENT IN THE PLAN TO HAVE GAVIRIAS TABLE A CONCRETE 
PLAN AROUND WHICH THE PARTIES COULD BEGIN DIALOGUE. 
 
4. (SBU)  ASKED WHETHER PAPAL NUNCIO DUPUY WOULD GREET 
PRESIDENT CHAVEZ AGAIN THIS YEAR AS DEAN OF THE DIPLOMATIC 
CORPS, LINGUA SAID HE HADN\'T YET HEARD.  HE SPECULATED THAT 
THE ANNUAL MEETING MIGHT BE POSTPONED THIS YEAR, GIVEN THE 
SITUATION ON THE STREETS.  LINGUA WRYLY NOTED THAT IF THE 
NUNCIO TRULY SPOKE HIS MIND AGAIN HE MIGHT BE PNG\'D. (NOTE: 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00105  01 OF 02  101650Z 
SOME MAY RECALL THAT DUPUY\'S URGING OF CHAVEZ IN REMARKS LAST 
JANUARY TO MAKE SPACE FOR THE OPPOSITION\'S DEMANDS PROMPTED 
FROM THE LATTER A VITUPERATIVE ATTACK ON THE CHURCH AS A 
\"PARASITE ON VENEZUELAN SOCIETY.\")  LINGUA TOLD US THAT 
NUNCIOS USUALLY DRAFT THEIR ANNUAL REMARKS WITHOUT CLEARING 
THEM WITH THE HOLY SEE, AND THAT THEY WOULD GENERALLY AIM FOR 
REMARKS THAT REFLECT THE VIEWS OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS AS 
OPPOSED TO THOSE OF THE HOLY SEE. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: THE HOLY SEE IS FEARFUL THAT IF IT WERE TO 
ENGAGE MORE ACTIVELY IN BRINGING THE VENEZUELAN PARTIES 
TOGETHER, ITS OWN POOR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHAVEZ 
ADMINISTRATION, EXEMPLIFIED IN CHAVEZ\' REACTION TO THE 
NUNCIO\'S JANUARY 2002 COMMENTS, WOULD BE MADE EVEN WORSE. 
THIS COULD HAVE UNPREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE CLERGY 
AND FAITHFUL WHO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION.  LINGUA\'S REACTIONS 
SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT THE HOLY SEE IS NOT FULLY IN CONTROL 
OF THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS, NOR OF ITS OWN NUNCIO.  WE WOULD 
BE INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM EMBASSY CARACAS WHETHER THEY ARE 
CONSULTING WITH DUPUY ON HIS REMARKS, IF ANY, AT THIS YEAR\'S

PEACE AND SOLIDARITY AMONG NATIONS 
 
 ------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.    IN HIS ANNUAL SPEECH TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS JANUARY 
13, POPE JOHN PAUL II OFFERED HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THE STATE OF 
THE WORLD.  CITING THE CURRENT \"FEAR THAT OFTEN DWELLS IN THE 
HEARTS OF OUR CONTEMPORARIES,\" HE IDENTIFIED THE CAUSES OF 
THIS FEAR AS: \"INSIDIOUS TERRORISM, UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST INCLUDING THE HOLY LAND AND IRAQ, THE TURMOIL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00135  01 OF 02  141831Z 
IN SOUTH AMERICA -- ARGENTINA, COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA -- 
FAMINE AND CONFLICTS IN AFRICA, PANDEMICS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
EXPLOITATION.  THE POPE SOUGHT TO STRIKE A NOTE OF OPTIMISM 
AMIDST THIS LITANY OF WOES, ASSERTING THAT RESPECT FOR LIFE, 
RESPECT FOR LAW, AND SOLIDARITY CAN PREVENT HUMANITY FROM 
\"SINKING INTO THE ABYSS.\"  WHILE THE POPE MADE A STRONG 
APPEAL AGAINST WAR, HE DID NOT CLOSE THE DOOR ON WAR AS A 
LAST OPTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE UN.  CONTRARY TO 
HEADLINES IN ONE ITALIAN PAPER, THE HOLY SEE TOLD US THEY ARE 
NOT PLANNING ON SENDING ENVOYS TO IRAQ AND BAGDAD AT THIS 
TIME. 
 
------------- 
WAR WITH IRAQ 
------------- 
 
2.    AS EXPECTED, THE POPE\'S ANNUAL ADDRESS TO THE 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS STRONGLY REJECTED WAR, TERRORISM AND ARMED 
VIOLENCE SPECIFICALLY IN ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES AND 
IRAQ.  WHILE THE MEDIA FOCUS WILL BE ON THE POPE\'S \"NO TO 
WAR,\" THE POPE ALSO MAINTAINED THE LINES OF THE FULL HOLY SEE 
POSITION ON IRAQ WHICH RECOGNIZES THAT THE DECISION TO WAGE 
WAR TO ENSURE THE COMMON GOOD WAS AN OPTION -- EVEN IF A LAST 
ONE AND \"IN ACCORDANCE WITH VERY STRICT CONDITIONS\" (I.E., 
THE HOLY SEE\'S INTERPRETATION OF THE JUST WAR THEORY). 
ACCORDING TO THE POPE, ONLY THE UN HAD THE INTERNATIONAL 
AUTHORITY TO MAKE A DECISION TO WAGE WAR.  BUT HE 
SPECIFICALLY UNDERLINED THAT CONFLICTS CAN BE AVOIDED BY 
\"GOOD WILL, TRUST IN OTHERS, FIDELITY TO COMMITMENTS AND 
COOPERATION BETWEEN RESPONSIBLE PARTNERS.\"  HE ALSO 
EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF COUNTRIES RESPECTING COMMON AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00135  01 OF 02  141831Z 
INVIOLABLE PRINCIPLES IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE STABILITY TO ALL 
PEOPLES. (COMMENT: WE TAKE THE PONTIFF\'S REFERENCE TO LIVING 
UP TO ONE\'S COMMITMENTS AS A DIRECT APPEAL TO BOTH IRAQ AND 
NORTH KOREA TO BEHAVE AS RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  END COMMENT). 
 
------------------------ 
SOLIDARITY AMONG NATIONS 
------------------------ 
 
3.    THE POPE\'S SAID THE WORLD\'S VARIOUS CRISES COULD BE 
AVERTED ONLY WITH RESPECT FOR LIFE, INCLUDING THE REJECTION 
OF CLONING AND EUTHANASIA, AS WELL AS THE REJECTION OF WAR; 
RESPECT FOR LAW AS A FOUNDATION FOR NATIONAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL STABILITY; AND THE DUTY OF SOLIDARITY WITH LESS 
FORTUNATE PEOPLES AND NATIONS AS A COUNTER TO VIOLENCE. HE 
EXHORTED DEVELOPED NATIONS TO SHARE THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL 
KNOW-HOW WITH DEVELOPING NATIONS.  HERE, HE SPECIFICALLY 
CALLED ON THE DEVELOPED WORLD TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO WATER, AND 
TO GENERIC MEDICINES TO FIGHT CURRENT PANDEMICS.  (COMMENT: 
THE HOLY SEE REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF THE WTO 
TALKS IN GENEVA LAST MONTH ON TRIPS, AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS 
FOR THE POOREST COUNTRIES.  END COMMENT.) 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CHRISTIAN EUROPE AND RESTRICTIVE RUSSIA 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.    THE POPE USED HIS ADDRESS TO REPEAT THE HOLY SEE\'S CALL 
FOR CHRISTIANITY AND RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED 
IN A PROPOSED EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION.  ACCORDING TO THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00135  01 OF 02  141831Z 
PONTIFF, THE NEWLY ENLARGED EUROPE IS THE FRUIT AND RECIPIENT 
OF CHRISTIAN VALUES.  IN RECOGNITION OF THIS FOUNDATION, HE 
CALLED FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, STRUCTURES FOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN 
NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND CHURCHES, AND PROTECTION OF ALREADY 
GAINED NATIONAL JURIDICAL STATUS AS KEY CONSTITUTIONAL 
ELEMENTS TO ASSURE CONTINUED PROTECTION OF RELIGION IN 
EUROPE.  THE POPE MADE AN IMPASSIONED PLEA FOR RUSSIAN 
AUTHORITIES TO ALLOW CATHOLIC CLERGY FREE ACCESS TO CONDUCT 
THEIR PASTORAL WORK IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.  HE 
UNDERSCORED THAT HE WAS STILL WAITING FOR A FORMAL RESPONSE 
FROM RUSSIAN REGARDING ITS REFUSALS OF VISAS TO FOREIGN 
PRIESTS AND BISHOPS. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
AFRICA: REASONS TO REJOICE AND DESPAIR 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.    THE POPE GAVE SPECIAL FOCUS TO AFRICA, EXPRESSING 
SATISFACTION THAT ANGOLA, BURUNDI, AND THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO AND EVEN SUDAN HAD EMBARKED ON THE PATH OF 
PEACE.  TO BUILD ON THIS SUCCESS, HE URGED UNDERSTANDING AND

7.    WHILE MEDIA ARE LIKELY TO FOCUS ON THE \"NO TO WAR\" 
PHRASE, THE POPE\'S DISCOURSE REMAINED BALANCED ON IRAQ AND 
THE MIDDLE EAST, AND AVOIDED DIRECT CRITICISM OF THE U.S.  IN 
FACT, HIS FOCUS ON RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHICH, ON 
THE ONE HAND, SEEKS TO ENSURE THE U.S. ACTS WITHIN THE UN 
FRAMEWORK, ALSO CLEARLY SUGGESTS THAT THE IRAQ\'S AND NORTH 
KOREA\'S OF THE WORLD NEED TO FOLLOW RULES OF CONDUCT AND 
ADHERE TO AGREEMENTS ALREADY SIGNED.  IN LIGHT OF OUR ONGOING 
DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE ON AFRICAN FAMINE, WE WELCOMED THE 
PONTIFF\'S REFERENCES TO FAMINE IN AFRICA, AND HIS OPENING THE 
DOOR TO \"KNOW HOW\" IN RESPONDING TO DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.  HIS 
BLAST AT CONTINUED VISA PROBLEMS FOR CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN 
RUSSIA REFLECTS THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH HE VIEWS THIS 
PROBLEM, WHICH HE TERMED A \"CRISIS\" NOT IN KEEPING WITH 
RUSSIA\'S DEMOCRATIC ASPIRATIONS. END COMMENT.

CHRISTIAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT FOUNDER OSVALDO PAYA AT THE END 
OF A GENERAL AUDIENCE JANUARY 8 (REF A), WOULD NOT MEET 
PRIVATELY WITH HIM, AS SPECULATED IN THE PRESS, BECAUSE THE 
CHURCH DID NOT WISH TO PROVOKE A NEGATIVE REACTION FROM THE 
CUBAN GOVERNMENT.  PAYA REPORTEDLY EXPRESSED SATISFACTION 
WITH THE BRIEF ENCOUNTER, CLAIMING \"ONE CANNOT ASPIRE FOR 
MORE IN AN IMPROVISED TRIP WITHOUT A FIXED AGENDA.\" 
 
2. (C) IN HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CUBAN EMBASSY TO THE 
HOLY SEE, LINGUA SAYS HE HAS PRESSED THE CUBANS TO CULTIVATE 
PAYA AS A \"SOFT OPPOSITIONIST.\"  ACCORDING TO LINGUA, THE 
CUBAN EMBASSY CONSISTENTLY REPLIES BY DOWNPLAYING THE 
INFLUENCE OF THE OPPOSITION.  LINGUA SAID PAYA WAS A 
COMMITTED CATHOLIC WHO WISHES TO WORK FOR CHANGE WITHIN 
CUBA\'S SYSTEM.  HE TOLD US THAT WHEN THE CASTRO GOVERNMENT 
REBUFFED THE VARELA PROJECT WITH THE REFERENDUM REAFFIRMING 
THE SOCIALIST CONSTITUTION, PAYA TOLD THE CHURCH HE WAS HAPPY 
THAT HIS APPROACH OF \"USING THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF\" HAD BEEN 
\"REAFFIRMED.\" 
 
3. (C) QUERIED ON WHETHER THE CHURCH WAS CONTENT WITH THE 
PACE OF CHANGE IN CUBA, LINGUA TOLD US THE CHURCH ASSIDUOUSLY 
AVOIDS POLITICAL ACTIVISM, SO AS TO PROTECT SPACE FOR ITS 
PASTORAL WORK.  HE TOLD US THE GOC HAD COMPLAINED ON OCCASION 
ABOUT THE CHURCH\'S LIBRARIES, AND SOMETIMES IT REFUSED OR 
RESTRICTED VISAS FOR CLERGY, BUT LINGUA DID NOT SIGNAL THAT 
THE CHURCH WOULD TAKE THOSE RESTRICTIONS AS SERIOUSLY AS THEY 
HAVE TAKEN THE RUSSIANS\' SIMILAR ACTIONS (NOTE: THE POPE 
HIMSELF DECRIED THE RUSSIAN VISA REFUSALS IN HIS ANNUAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00195  161459Z 
ADDRESS TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS JANUARY 13). 
 
4. (C)  LINGUA MENTIONED THAT THIS MONTH MARKS THE FIVE YEAR 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE\'S GROUNDBREAKING VISIT TO CUBA.  HE 
TOLD US (PROTECT) THAT THE GOC HAD INVITED THE POPE AND/OR FM 
TAURAN TO VISIT THE ISLAND TO TAKE PLACE IN COMMEMORATIVE 
EVENTS.  LINGUA BELIEVED TAURAN WOULD ACCEPT THE INVITATION, 
BUT WOULD KEEP THE VISIT LOW-KEY AND TRY TO COMBINE IT WITH 
PASTORAL VISITS TO CUBA\'S BELEAGUERED BISHOPS.  EMBASSY WILL 
CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE TAURAN TO MEET WITH PAYA AND OTHER 
DISSIDENTS IF SUCH A VISIT WERE TO TAKE PLACE.  WE NOTE FROM 
LOCAL PRESS ACCOUNTS AS WELL AS REF B THAT CUBAN CARDINAL 
JAIME ORTEGA RECENTLY LAMENTED PUBLICLY IN CUBA THE LACK OF 
PROGRESS SINCE THE POPE\'S VISIT, ASSERTING THAT THERE WAS NO 
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE SINCE 1998, THAT SOCIAL-POLITICAL SPACE 
REMAINED LIMITED, AND THAT THE CHURCH CONTINUED TO BE 
IGNORED.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR R.J. NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B),(D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE HOLY SEE IS \"HAPPY TO HEAR THE GOOD 
NEWS\" (REF) THAT PRC OFFICIALS ARE WAITING FOR A \'GESTURE\' 
FROM THE VATICAN IN ORDER TO RESUME DIALOG ABOUT NORMALIZING 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS.  THE HOLY SEE WILL USE 
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO \"TEST\" WHETHER THE NEW PRC GOVERNMENT 
WILL BE MORE FLEXIBLE AND WILLING TO ENGAGE THAN WAS THE 
PREVIOUS LEADERSHIP.  THE HOLY SEE INTENDS TO VERIFY THE 
\"AVAILABILITY\" OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT BY APPROACHING THE PRC 
EMBASSY TO ITALY.  MFA DIRECTOR FOR CHINA AFFAIRS, MSGR. 
ROTA-GRAZIOSI, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE HOLY SEE IS READY TO FIND 
SOLUTIONS TO THE THREE MAIN OBSTACLES BLOCKING NORMALIZATION 
OF RELATIONS, BUT THAT THE PRC MUST ENGAGE IN DIALOG IN ORDER 
TO REACH AN AGREEMENT.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI IDENTIFIED THE THREE 
OBSTACLES AS AUTONOMY OF THE CHURCH IN CHINA, DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND TAIWAN, AND PRC ACCEPTANCE 
OF THE POPE\'S RECOGNITION OF PAST MISTAKES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------- 
CHURCH AUTONOMY AND NORMALIZATION 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) ASSESSING THE OBSTACLES TO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS 
BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND CHINA, HOLY SEE MFA CHINA DIRECTOR 
MSGR. ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CHINA 
\"MUST BE AUTONOMOUS, BUT COULD NOT BE INDEPENDENT\" FROM THE 
HOLY SEE.  HE GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE 
U.S., WHICH WAS SELF-GOVERNING BUT ACCEPTED GUIDANCE AND 
INTERVENTION FROM THE POPE.  HE SEES THE CHURCH EVENTUALLY 
FUNCTIONING ROUGHLY IN THE SAME MANNER IN CHINA, EXCEPT WITH 
THE ADDITIONAL LAYER OF GOVERNMENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF ORDINATIONS AND OTHER PAPAL DECISIONS. 
 HE POINTED OUT THAT GOVERNMENTS IN EUROPE AND VIETNAM ARE 
INVOLVED IN THE ORDINATION PROCESS, WHICH THE CHURCH ACCEPTS 
-- UP TO A POINT. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

RECONCILING THE TWO CHURCHES 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THAT RECONCILING THE 
UNDERGROUND AND OFFICIAL BISHOPS IN CHINA WILL BE A 
\"DELICATE\" AND \"IMPORTANT\" MATTER.  THE HOLY SEE IS PREPARED 
TO REVIEW WITH THE PRC THE STATUS OF EACH BISHOP, WHETHER 
FROM THE UNDERGROUND OR OFFICIAL CHURCH, ON A CASE BY CASE 
BASIS.  THE HOLY SEE POSITION IS THAT ALL BISHOPS AND PRIESTS 
IN CHINA ARE VALID AND MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH (AND CAN 
ADMINISTER THE SACRAMENTS) BUT ONLY THOSE ORDAINED BY THE 
POPE ARE LEGITIMATE CATHOLIC PRIESTS.  THE HOLY SEE IS AWARE 
OF THE PRC\'S CONCERN ABOUT THE ROLE BEIJING BISHOP FU TIESHAN 
WILL PLAY IN THE FUTURE CHURCH.  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT 
BISHOP FU WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH, HOWEVER, THE IDEA THAT 
BISHOP FU WOULD BE PROMOTED TO A CARDINAL TO FACILITATE 
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WAS \"NONSENSE.\"  \"THE APPOINTMENT 
OF CARDINALS IS A PERSONAL CHOICE OF THE POPE.\" 
 
--------------------- 
RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C)  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE 
HOLY SEE IS \"WILLING TO CUT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN\" 
AND ESTABLISH THEM WITH BEIJING.  EVEN THOUGH THIS ACTION 
WOULD BE \"HUMILIATING\" TO TAIWAN, THE HOLY SEE IS \"PREPARED 
TO PAY THAT PRICE\" IN ORDER TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH THE 
PRC.  HE SAID THAT \"WHILE THE HOLY FATHER HAS TO THINK OF THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00215  01 OF 02  171350Z 
300,000 CATHOLICS IN TAIWAN HE MUST ALSO CONSIDER THE 10 
MILLION CATHOLICS IN MAINLAND CHINA AND HIS PASTORAL DUTIES 
TO THEM\".  WHEN ASKED IF THE HOLY SEE WOULD ALLOW SOME TIME 
TO PASS BETWEEN CUTTING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN AND 
ESTABLISHING THEM WITH THE PRC, ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT WAS A 
TOPIC THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH DIALOG.  THE 
HOLY SEE IS NOT WILLING TO CUT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AS A STEP 
TOWARD NORMALIZED RELATIONS BUT RATHER AS PART OF A PACKAGE 
OF \"CONCESSIONS WHICH MUST BE MADE\" THAT WILL GUARANTEE 
NORMALIZED RELATIONS.

5. (C)  ROTA-GRAZIOSI SAID THAT THE POPE WOULD NEVER

MAKE CHANGES WITHIN CHINA OUTSIDE OF THE ECONOMIC ARENA.  HE 
WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR FROM US PER REF EMAIL THAT THE PRC WAS 
WAITING FOR A \"GESTURE\" FROM THE HOLY SEE.  HE SAID THAT THE 
HOLY SEE WOULD \"VERIFY THE AVAILABILITY\" OF THE PRC EMBASSY 
TO ITALY AND ADVISE EMBASSY OF THE RESULTS. THE POPE BELIEVES 
HIS APOLOGY IN OCTOBER 2001 FOR THE EXCESSES OF THE CHURCH IN 
CHINA HAS LARGELY ADDRESSED CHINESE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PAST.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.   (U) THE HOLY SEE, CATHOLIC DIOCESES WORLDWIDE, 
AFFILIATED NGO\'S AND CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS ORDERS ARE 
SIGNIFICANT, IF OFTEN OVERLOOKED, PLAYERS IN INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORTS.  THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH IS IN EFFECT THE WORLD\'S LARGEST INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT AGENCY: SOME FOUR MILLION LAY PEOPLE, SISTERS, 
MONKS, PRIESTS AND BISHOPS WORKING IN VARIOUS FORMS OF 
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY MAKE A CONTRIBUTION WORTH BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS IN HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES, TECHNICAL, 
AGRICULTURAL AND VOCATIONAL FACILITIES, AND SOCIAL 
DEVELOPMENT CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPING WORLD. THIS 
\"COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE\" IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE CHURCH\'S 
SOCIAL DOCTRINE, WHICH HAS BEEN EXPANDED AND INTENSIFIED IN 
THE POST-VATICAN II PERIOD WHEN THE CHURCH FIRST LINKED 
WORLD PEACE TO HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. FOR THE HOLY SEE, THE 
INHERENT AND INALIENABLE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON FORMS 
THE CORE OF ITS DEVELOPMENT POLICY; PEOPLE MATTER, AND THEIR 
SPIRITUAL, SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING IS AT THE HEART OF 
THE HOLY SEE\'S APPROACH TO FOREIGN POLICY.  END SUMMARY.

KEY PLAYERS IN DEVELOPMENT AND RELIEF 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.   (U) THE HOLY SEE IS AN ACTIVE \"HANDS ON\" PLAYER IN 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHOSE ROLE IS NOT LIMITED TO 
TEACHING AND ENCOURAGING CHARITY. IN FACT, THE HOLY SEE 
OPERATES A GLOBAL RELIEF AGENCY, IS PRESENT IN THE MOST 
REMOTE AND BADLY AFFLICTED CRISES AREAS IN THE WORLD, AND 
CARES FOR 25 PERCENT OF ALL HIV/AIDS VICTIMS WORLDWIDE. IN 
SOME COUNTRIES, CATHOLIC AGENCIES ARE AMONG THE PRINCIPAL 
DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF 
EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE.  THE HOLY SEE\'S DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCIES AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS ARE OPEN TO PARTNERING 
WITH THE USG, AND EMBASSY BELIEVES THERE IS SCOPE FOR CLOSER 
COORDINATION IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ON HUMAN AND 
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  DESPITE SOME SKEPTICISM OF 
COMMERCIAL MOTIVES BEHIND CERTAIN U.S. INITIATIVES AND 
APPROACHES TO DEVELOPMENT, THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS ON 
DEVELOPMENT HAVE MOVED CLOSER TO U.S. VIEWS IN RECENT TIMES 
REGARDING THE NEED FOR RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT IN DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES (REFTEL). WE BELIEVE THE HOLY SEE WILL PROVE TO BE 
AN INCREASINGLY USEFUL ALLY IN PROMOTING THESE VIEWS 
WORLDWIDE. 
 
3.  (U) HOLY SEE CABINET-LEVEL DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENTS 
(DICASTRIES), WHICH FUNCTION AS THINK TANKS AND POLICY 
MAKING AGENCIES, ARE INFLUENTIAL IN SHAPING A GLOBAL 
CONSENSUS ON DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR A RANGE OF ISSUES 
INCLUDING HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, MIGRATION, GLOBALIZATION, 
AND HEALTH.  THE CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS FEDERATION, WITH 
MEMBERS IN 154 COUNTRIES, ENGAGES IN LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, OFTEN IN COLLABORATION WITH UN 
AGENCIES AND INTERNATIONAL NGOS.

(DICASTRIES) ARE CONCERNED WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ISSUES 
AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ASSISTANCE.  THE 
DICASTERIES TYPICALLY FUNCTION AS DEVELOPMENT THINK TANKS 
RATHER THAN DIRECT ASSISTANCE OR FUNDING AGENCIES.  THEY 
SUPERVISE, COORDINATE AND CONDUCT RESEARCH ON A WIDE RANGE 
OF DEVELOPMENT ISSUES INCLUDING MIGRATION, REFUGEES, LABOR,

5.   (U) THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE (PCJP) 
FOSTERS DEVELOPMENT OF NEEDY REGIONS AND PROMOTES SOCIAL 
JUSTICE (SOCIAL EQUITY) INTERNATIONALLY. ITS BRIEF INCLUDES 
LABOR ISSUES, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, DEVELOPMENT POLICY, 
AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. IT ALSO PROMOTES REFLECTION ON 
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMS -- INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF 
GLOBALIZATION -- PRODUCING IN 1999 FOR EXAMPLE, A REFLECTION 
ON TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN PREPARATION FOR THE WTO 
\"MILLENNIUM ROUND.\"  THE COUNCIL ALSO ADDRESSES 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES. THE PCJP, OFTEN 
ON BEHALF OF THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, TREATS A BROAD 
RANGE OF ISSUES RELATED TO WAR, DISARMAMENT AND THE ARMS 
TRADE, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, AND VIOLENCE IN ALL ITS 
MANIFESTATIONS -- INCLUDING TERRORISM AND XENOPHOBIC

RIGHTS POLICY, DEVELOPING ITS PLACE IN CHURCH TEACHING, 
ANALYZING ISSUES UNDER DISCUSSION IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, 
AND PROVIDING ADVOCACY FOR VICTIMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS. 
 
6.   (U) THE PCJP ALSO EXAMINES POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND THE 
ROLE OF CATHOLICS IN POLITICS IN LIGHT OF THE CHURCH\'S 
DESIRE TO WALK THE PHILOSOPHICAL TIGHTROPE BETWEEN RELIGIOUS 
BELIEF AND SECULAR POLITICS.  SINCE THE EARLY 1960\'S THE 
HOLY SEE HAS JUDGED SOME POLITICAL SYSTEMS AS CLOSER TO 
CHURCH THINKING THAN OTHERS: ATHEISTIC COMMUNISM HAS BEEN 
FLATLY REJECTED, RIGHT-WING MILITARY REGIMES SEVERELY 
CRITICIZED, AND LIBERAL CAPITALIST SYSTEMS TOLERATED BUT 
MONITORED CLOSELY FOR INCLUSION OF SOCIAL WELFARE 
PROVISIONS.  A KEY ISSUE FOR THE COUNCIL IS HUMAN RIGHTS 
WHICH IT TREATS IN THREE DISTINCT WAYS: DEVELOPING ITS PLACE 
IN CHURCH TEACHING, ANALYSIS OF ISSUES UNDER DISCUSSION IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA, PROVIDING ADVOCACY FOR VICTIMS OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  PCJP OFFICIALS REPRESENT THE HOLY SEE AT 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL OR DISARMAMENT 
CONFERENCES.  THE PROMOTION OF FORMER HOLY SEE PERMANENT 
OBSERVER TO THE UN, ARCHBISHOP RENATO MARTINO, TO HEAD THE 
PCJP AUGERS WELL FOR A MORE ACTIVIST PCJP AND FOR EVEN 
CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND THE USG ON MANY 
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.  MARTINO LIVED IN THE U.S. FOR 18 YEARS 
AND UNDERSTANDS US VALUES AND POLICY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER 
NON-AMERICAN AT THE HOLY SEE.  WHILE NOT ALWAYS IN AGREEMENT 
WITH THE US, MARTINO HAS SPOKEN OUT IN FAVOR OF BIOTECH 
FOODS TO AVERT STARVATION, ASSERTING THE ISSUE IS MORE 
POLITICAL THAN SCIENTIFIC.

7.   (U) PCMIP FOCUSES ON PEOPLE ON THE MOVE INCLUDING 
REFUGEES, ECONOMIC MIGRANTS, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS

WORKS IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CATHOLIC 
MIGRATION COMMISSION, CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS AND THE JESUIT 
REFUGEE SERVICES, WHICH IN TURN OPERATE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL 
IN PLACES SUCH AS KOSOVO AND AFRICA\'S GREAT LAKES REGION 
PROVIDING HEALTH CARE, ADVOCACY SERVICES AND REPATRIATION 
ASSISTANCE.  THE PCMIP SEEKS TO ENSURE HOLY SEE POLICY AND 
SENSIBILITIES ARE RESPECTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.  RECENTLY 
PARTNERSHIPS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AT THE ECUMENICAL AND 
INTER-RELIGIOUS LEVEL IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHAD, ANGOLA AND 
MACEDONIA TO ENSURE A GREATER OUTREACH TO REFUGEES AND 
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE.  PCMIP WORKS CLOSELY WITH UNHCR 
ON MORAL AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUES, AND IN AN ADVOCACY 
ROLE FOR PARTICULAR GROUPS -- ROMA/GYPSIES FOR EXAMPLE.  THE 
HOLY SEE IS A MEMBER OF THE UNHCR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND 
FOSTERS PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN UNHCR AND CATHOLIC CHURCH-BASED 
AGENCIES.  TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS IS A MAJOR CONCERN OF THIS

SUBJECT: PARTNERS FOR PROGRESS - WORKING WITH VATICAN 
DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES 
 
MADE FOR THE POOREST, WEAKEST OR MOST MARGINALIZED MEMBERS 
OF SOCIETY.  CARITAS DOES THIS THROUGH PUBLIC CAMPAIGNING 
AND DIRECT LOBBYING OF GOVERNMENTS AND INSTITUTIONS.  THE 
CURRENT ADVOCACY ISSUES INCLUDE PALESTINE AND ISRAEL, IRAQI 
SANCTIONS AND POSSIBLE WAR, THE UN CONFERENCE ON FINANCING 
FOR DEVELOPMENT, THE CRISIS IN SIERRA LEONE, INTERNATIONAL 
DEBT, AND TRADE FAIRNESS. 
 
12.  (U) HIGH-PROFILE MEMBERS OF THE CARITAS FEDERATION 
INCLUDE U.S. CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES (CRS) AND U.K. CAFOD. 
BOTH AGENCIES HAVE EXTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
PROGRAMS.  FOR EXAMPLE, CRS WORK WITH LOCAL PARTNERS AND 
OTHER INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO RESPOND TO 
PRESENT FOOD SHORTAGES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND AVERT A FAMINE 
IN THE REGION.  AT PRESENT, THE AGENCY PLANS TO DISTRIBUTE 
MORE THAN 45,000 METRIC TONS OF FOOD, SUCH AS MAIZE, FLOUR 
AND VEGETABLE OIL, TO NEARLY 400,000 FAMILIES IN THE REGION. 
CRS IS ALSO TARGETING ITS RESPONSE TO COMMUNITIES WHERE IT 
HAS EXISTING PROGRAMS DEALING WITH HIV/AIDS -- SUPPLYING 
FOOD TO THE MOST VULNERABLE: CHILD-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS, 
PREGNANT AND LACTATING MOTHERS AND CHILDREN UNDER FIVE. 
 
13.  (U) UK-BASED CAFOD IS ALSO ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN 
DEVELOPMENT WORK IN SOUTHERN AFRICA - PARTICULARLY IN 
FEEDING AND HIV/AIDS PREVENTION AND TREATMENT.  THE AGENCY\'S 
PROGRAMS IN THE REGION ARE ALREADY FEEDING HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN ZIMBABWE, MALAWI,

ANGOLA, MOZAMBIQUE AND SWAZILAND.  CAFOD HAS ALSO LAUNCHED A 
SPECIAL APPEAL FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA, RESULTING IN MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS IN DONATIONS.  CAFOD IS USING NOURISHMENT TO HELP 
AIDS SUFFERERS LIVE WITH THE CONDITION.  CARE PROGRAMS 
CONDUCTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL CHURCH AGENCIES PROVIDE 
HIGH-PROTEIN BALANCED DIETS TO PATIENTS AS A WAY TO STAY 
HEALTHY.  THE PROGRAMS HOWEVER, ARE THREATENED BY THE 
ESCALATING SOUTHERN AFRICAN FOOD CRISIS. 
 
14.  (U) OTHER CARITAS FEDERATION MEMBERS IN FIRST WORLD 
COUNTRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE AND AUSTRALASIA UNDERTAKE 
SIMILAR PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD -- PREFERABLY WORKING 
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND CHURCH-BASED GROUPS - 
- TO FOSTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY.

15.  (U) THIS ROME-BASED INTERNATIONAL VOLUNTEER 
ORGANIZATION IS INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS CHARITABLE AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS 
AND HAS BEEN NICKNAMED \"THE POPE\'S UNITED NATIONS\".  HAVING 
GAINED INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR ITS WORK IN ENDING THE 
MOZAMBIQUE CONFLICT, IT ALSO CONDUCTS LOWER-PROFILE BUT 
VITAL DEVELOPMENT WORK, ESPECIALLY IN AFRICA.  THE FIRST, A 
FOOD RELIEF PROGRAM IN ONE OF MALAWI\'S MOST ISOLATED AND 
POOR AREAS PROVIDES NON-PERISHABLE HIGH PROTEIN FOOD SUCH AS 
RICE, BEANS, OIL, SUGAR AND VITAMIN-ENRICHED BISCUITS FOR 
CHILDREN.  THE SECOND, AN HIV/AIDS PREVENTION AND TREATMENT 
PROGRAM IN MOZAMBIQUE, PROVIDES TESTING, LOCAL STAFF

TRAINING, HEALTH EDUCATION, ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY, 
MONITORING OF BLOOD DONATIONS, PREVENTION AND CARE OF AIDS- 
LINKED DISEASES, NUTRITIONAL SUSTENANCE TO AIDS SUFFERS AND 
HOME CARE FOR THE SERIOUSLY ILL.  SANT\'EGIDIO HAS APPROACHED 
EMBASSY AND STATE DEPARTMENT/AID FOR SUPPORT.  EMBASSY 
STRONGLY SUPPORTS SUCH REQUESTS AND WILL SOLICIT FUNDING

LOCAL CHURCH AND RELIGIOUS ORDERS 
--------------------------------- 
 
16.  (U) MANY RELIGIOUS ORDERS AND LOCAL CHURCH GROUPS 
AROUND THE WORLD PROVIDE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES SUCH SCHOOLS 
AND UNIVERSITIES, AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY, HEALTH CARE AND 
VOCATIONAL TRAINING.  THE LARGER RELIGIOUS ORDERS, SUCH AS 
THE JESUITS ALSO HAVE SPECIALIST AGENCIES.  THE JESUIT 
REFUGEE SERVICE (JRS) WORKS IN OVER 40 COUNTRIES, WITH A 
MISSION TO ACCOMPANY, SERVE AND DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF 
REFUGEES AND FORCIBLY DISPLACED PEOPLE.  JRS ALSO PROVIDES 
SHELTER, EDUCATION, AND MEDICAL CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE 
DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES BY CONFLICT, HUMANITARIAN DISASTER 
OR VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  JRS UNDERTAKES SERVICES AT

DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES 
 
INTERNATIONAL OFFICE IN ROME. IT PRIORITIZES ITS WORK BASED 
ON THE URGENCY OF THE NEEDS OF DISPLACED PEOPLE UNATTENDED 
BY OTHER AGENCIES. ITS SERVICES -- INCLUDING EDUCATION FOR 
CHILDREN AND ADULTS, SOCIAL SERVICES AND COUNSELING, AND 
HEALTH CARE -- ARE TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS.  MOST 
RECENTLY JRS HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN KOSOVO, RWANDA, UGANDA, AND 
BURUNDI.  THE JESUITS HAVE PROGRAMS FOR HIV/AIDS WORK 
FOCUSED ON SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.  A FURTHER EXAMPLE OF THE 
EXTENT OF JESUIT INVOLVEMENT IN SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS IN 
INDIA WHERE THE JESUIT INDIAN SOCIAL INSTITUTE WORKS WITH 
SOME 5000 VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS TO COORDINATE AND NETWORK 
FOR THE SOCIAL-CULTURAL RIGHTS OF THE POOR AND MARGINALIZED. 
SIMILAR EFFORTS ARE CARRIED OUT WORLDWIDE BY HUNDREDS OF 
RELIGIOUS ORDERS.  SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE 
CONDUCTED BY OTHER RELIGIOUS ORDERS INCLUDING FRANCISCANS 
AND DOMINICANS. 
 
17.  (U) NATIONAL GROUPINGS OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS ALSO ENGAGE 
IN DEVELOPMENT WORK, OFTEN THROUGH SPECIFICALLY CONSTITUTED 
AGENCIES. THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN BISHOPS CONDUCT HUNDREDS OF 
EDUCATION, PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN SOUTH 
AFRICA, NAMIBIA, LESOTHO, SWAZILAND AND BOTSWANA, MAKING IT 
ONE OF THE KEY AGENCIES IN A REGION WHERE CATHOLICS ARE A 
MINORITY.  THE US BISHOPS ARE SIMILARLY ACTIVE IN CENTRAL 
AMERICA.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
18.  (SBU) THE HOLY SEE ITSELF APPEARS TO HAVE MADE A 
PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT IN RECENT YEARS ON ITS APPROACH TO 
DEVELOPMENT.  WHILE MANY POSITION PAPERS STILL CARRY MORE 
THAN A HINT OF A DEVELOPMENT MESSAGE ROOTED IN THE HALCYON 
DAYS OF LIBERATION THEOLOGY AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT THEORY OF THE LATE 1960S, RECENT STATEMENTS -- 
AT THE JOHANNESBURG SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, FOR 
EXAMPLE -- REFLECT A POSITION CLOSER TO THAT OF THE USG. 
RECIPIENTS OF DEVELOPMENT AID ARE ASKED TO BECOME 
PROTAGONISTS AND PARTNERS IN THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT. CONCEPTS 
SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, GOOD GOVERNANCE, ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
MARKET LIBERALIZATION NOW PROVIDE A COUNTERBALANCE TO 
BLAMING \"UNJUST STRUCTURES\" OR \"UNBRIDLED CAPITALISM\" FOR 
THE WORLD\'S WOES.  THE POPE HAS REINFORCED THESE CONCEPTS IN 
RECENT MESSAGES AND STATEMENTS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE NEW 
PERSPECTIVE WILL TRICKLE DOWN FROM THE DICASTERIES TO 
DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TO SHAPE THEIR POLICIES AND STRATEGIES. 
GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VATICAN\'S VOICE THROUGHOUT THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD. EMBASSY BELIEVES USG DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES 
SHOULD SEEK TO BROADEN CONTACTS WITH THE HOLY SEE TO BUILD 
SUPPORT FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND INITIATIVES AND TO 
DEVELOP SYNERGIES WITH THE MANY VATICAN-RELATED DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCIES.  END COMMENT.

1.  HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINISTER ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN 
CALLED IN AMBASSADOR JANUARY 21 TO SHARE THE RESULTS OF THE 
VATICAN NUNCIO IN ZAMBIA\'S ASSESSMENT OF THE FAMINE AND THE 
DEBATE IN ZAMBIA OVER BIOTECH RELIEF FOOD.  TAURAN HAD 
PREVIOUSLY PROMISED THE AMBASSADOR \"GOOD NEWS\" ON THE 
SUBJECT.  TO THIS END, HE HIGHLIGHTED THE HOLY SEE\'S EARLY 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO AMELIORATE THE FAMINE THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES 
OF CARITAS AND LOCAL CHURCHES.  TAURAN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE 
ANTI-BIOTECH VIEWS OF THE JESUIT ACTIVIST FATHER HENRIOT HAD 
BECOME WIDELY REGARDED AS THE VIEW OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN 
ZAMBIA, AND PROMISED THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD 
ENSURE THAT ITS GENERALLY PRO-BIOTECH VIEWS WERE PROVIDED TO 
THE ZAMBIAN CONFERENCE OF BISHOPS.  THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEW, AS 
OUTLINED IN A LETTER TO SECRETARY POWELL LAST YEAR (REF C) IS 
THAT BIOTECH FOODS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO POPULATIONS IN 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATE CAUTION 
COMPARABLE TO THOSE FOR PHARMACEUTICAL GOODS.  THE HOLY SEE 
WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE THE BISHOPS AND, IF THEY ARE RELUCTANT, 
THE NUNCIO, TO SPEAK OUT MORE DIRECTLY ON THE SUBJECT.  A 
RECENT EMBASSY-ORGANIZED CONFERENCE WITH A GROUP OF AFRICAN 
FARMERS AND BIOTECH EXPERTS -- INCLUDING ZAMBIA -- (SEPTEL) 
HELPED MAKE THE CASE TO KEY HOLY SEE OFFICES OF THE SAFETY 
AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF BIOTECH FOODS FOR AFRICA.  END

2.  ARCHBISHOP TAURAN MET WITH AMBASSADOR AND DCM JANUARY 21 
TO FOLLOW UP ON HIS PLEDGE TO LOOK INTO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S 
ROLE IN RESPONDING TO THE FAMINE IN ZAMBIA AND OTHER AFFECTED 
AREAS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  AT THE OUTSET, TAURAN SOUGHT TO 
MAKE CLEAR THAT THE HOLY SEE AND ITS AFFILIATED AGENCIES HAD 
BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO RESPOND. 
FROM FEBRUARY 2002, HE NOTED, THE POPE HAD DONATED $30,000 
FROM HIS (MODEST) PAPAL FUND FOR GLOBAL RELIEF EFFORTS, AND, 
MORE SIGNIFICANTLY, CARITAS HAD MOBILIZED ITS RESOURCES EARLY 
AND HAD BEEN PLAYED AN IMPORTANT HUMANITARIAN ROLE THROUGHOUT 
THE FAMINE PERIOD.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE LOCAL CHURCHES HAD 
BEEN ACTIVE ON THE GROUND IN PROVIDING ASSISTANCE. 
 
3.  ACCORDING TO THE NUNCIO, THE HOLY SEE WAS INFORMED THAT 
THE ZAMBIAN MAIZE CROP SHORTFALL HAD \"NOT YET HAD SERIOUS 
EFFECTS, THANKS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER FOODS IN THE 
COUNTRY.\"  THE NUNCIO FURTHER MAINTAINED THAT GM FOODS WERE 
NOT INDISPENSABLE TO MEET THE PROBLEM, AS THERE WERE ONLY 
15,000 TONS OF GM MAIZE IN DEPOSIT AT THE CATHOLIC RELIEF 
SERVICES HEADQUARTERS IN ZAMBIA, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
100,000 TONS OF NON-GM MAIZE IN RESERVE AND IS FINDING OTHER 
SOURCES.  THE NUNCIO OPINED THAT THE SITUATION \"WILL PROBABLY 
NOT GET WORSE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.\" 
 
------------------------------------------- 
A PLEDGE TO CLARIFY THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  TAURAN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT JESUIT ACTIVIST FATHER HENRIOT 
HAD UNFORTUNATELY SHAPED THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THE 
CHURCH\'S VIEW IN ZAMBIA.  THIS RESULTED, HE SAID, FROM A 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00402  01 OF 02  030858Z 
COMBINATION OF HENRIOT\'S PERSONAL ACTIVISM AND THE SILENCE OF 
THE ZAMBIAN CONFERENCE OF BISHOPS, WHO HAVE MADE NO OFFICIAL 
STATEMENT OF THE ADVISABILITY OF ACCEPTING BIOTECH FOODS. 
CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUNCIO REPORTED THAT \"THE POSITION OF THE 
JESUIT CENTER IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE POSITION OF THE 
CHURCH.\"  THE JESUIT\'S POSITION, WHICH HAS UNFORTUNATELY 
HELPED FRAME THE DEBATE OVER BIOTECH FOODS IN ZAMBIA AND 
WHICH MUST NOW BE OVERCOME WITH NEW INFORMATION, WAS 
SUMMARIZED BY THE NUNCIO IN HIS REPORT AS FOLLOWS: 
 
- THE SAFETY OF THESE FOODS IS STILL UNDER STUDY; 
 
- THE CONSUMPTION OF GM FOODS IN THE U.S. IS INTEGRATED IN 
THE CONSUMPTION OF ALL FOODS, WHEREAS IN ZAMBIA IT WOULD BE 
THE ONLY TYPE OF FOOD CONSUMED, WHICH \"WOULD WEIGH UPON THE 
DETERMINATION OF ITS SAFETY); 
 
- ZAMBIA IS RESOLVING THE PROBLEM BY IMPORTING 
NON-GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND IS EDUCATING ITS PEOPLE TO 
DIVERSIFY ITS EATING HABITS;

5.  IN LIGHT OF THESE POSITIONS, TAURAN AGREED WITH THE 
AMBASSADOR ON THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S MORE 
BALANCED POSITION WAS WIDELY DISSEMINATED IN THE COUNTRY AND 
REGIONS.  HE PROMISED TO ENSURE THE RESULTS OF THE PONTIFICAL 
ACADEMY OF SCIENCE\'S POSITION -- WHICH SEES NO REASON FOR 
REJECTION OF BIOTECH FOODS AND THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO 
DEVELOPING COUNTRY POPULATIONS AS LONG AS THE PRECAUTIONARY 
PRINCIPAL IS OBSERVED (AS IT IS WITH PHARMACEUTICALS) -- ARE 
PROVIDED TO ALL THE BISHOPS.  THE HOLY SEE WOULD THEN 
ENCOURAGE THE BISHOPS TO ISSUE A STATEMENT AND DISSEMINATE 
THE WORD IN THEIR CHURCHES.  TAURAN ADDED THAT IF THE BISHOPS 
FAILED TO DO SO -- WHICH IS POSSIBLE GIVEN THAT THE HOLY SEE 
CANNOT ORDER BISHOPS TO TAKE SPECIFIC STANDS ON POLITICAL 
ISSUES -- HE WOULD HAVE THE NUNCIO TAKE STEPS TO GET THE HOLY 
SEE\'S POSITION OUT. 
 
6.  THE AMBASSADOR THANKED TAURAN FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO 
ENSURE THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION WAS DISSEMINATED MORE WIDELY 
IN ZAMBIA AND THE REST OF SOUTHERN AFRICA, BUT STRESSED THE 
IMPORTANCE OF MOVING QUICKLY GIVEN THE STILL PRESENT THREAT 
OF FAMINE IN THE COUNTRY.  WHILE THE AMBASSADOR RECOGNIZED 
THAT THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM HAD TAKEN STEPS TO WORK AROUND 
THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT\'S REJECTION OF U.S. AID, THE 
AMBASSADOR STRESSED THE INCREASED COSTS AND TIME THIS HAD 
IMPOSED ON THE RELIEF EFFORT.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT OUR 
INFORMATION WAS NOT AS SANGUINE AS THAT PRESENTED BY THE 
NUNCIO, ALTHOUGH FOOD NOW APPEARED TO BE IN THE PIPELINE. 
BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE SITUATION, HOWEVER, THE AMBASSADOR 
POINTED OUT THAT THE ZAMBIAN DECISION REPRESENTED A NEGATIVE

AFRICAN RELIEF IF MORE COUNTRIES BEGAN FOLLOWING ZAMBIA\'S

OVER 60 PERCENT OF ALL RELIEF FOOD TO THE REGION, THE 
AMBASSADOR NOTED, SUCH RESTRICTIONS WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE 
FOR HE WFP TO MEET ITS DEMANDS).  TAURAN AGREED THAT SUCH A 
PRECEDENT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE, AND CONTRARY TO EFFORTS TO 
FEED THOSE IN NEED.

COMMENT

7.  THE HOLY SEE\'S RESPONSE ON THIS ISSUE, ABOUT WHICH THE 
EMBASSY HAS BEEN PRESSING SINCE EARLY FALL, HAS BEEN SLOW IN 
COMING.  NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOURCES WITHIN THE 
HOLY SEE THAT OUR REPEATED INTERVENTIONS -- RECENTLY 
REINFORCED BY OUR CANADIAN AND ARGENTINEAN DIPLOMATIC 
COLLEAGUES -- HAS GOTTEN THE HOLY SEE\'S ATTENTION AND LED TO 
MOVEMENT ON THE ISSUE.  SIGNIFICANTLY, THE POPE MADE TWO 
REFERENCES TO FAMINE IN AFRICA IN HIS ANNUAL ADDRESS TO THE 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS, REINFORCING THE FOCUS THE ISSUE IS NOW 
RECEDING.  THIS GROWING INTEREST WAS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE 
BROAD VATICAN PARTICIPATION AT AN EMBASSY-SPONSORED 
CONFERENCE JANUARY 27 ON BIOTECH IN AFRICA, WHICH WAS 
ATTENDED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE, THE 
COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE, COR UNUM (RESPONSIBLE FOR 
HUMANITARIAN WORK), THE JESUIT DIRECTORS FOR AFRICA AND THE 
U.S., THE CARITAS CATHOLIC RELIEF AGENCY, THE SANT EGIDIO 
COMMUNITY, AND MEMBERS OF THE HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC CORPS. 
EMBASSY LUSAKA\'S PRESSURE HAS ALSO BEEN HELPFUL IN RAISING 
THE HOLY SEE\'S APPRECIATION OF THE ISSUE, AND WE WOULD URGE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00402  02 OF 02  030859Z 
THAT THIS BE CONTINUED IN LIGHT OF THE NUNCIO\'S POSITIVE 
REPORT TO THE VATICAN ABOUT THE EMBASSY\'S EFFORTS TO ELICIT A 
MORE ACTIVE AND BALANCED POSITION.  EMBASSY VATICAN WILL 
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE HOLY SEE AND AFFILIATED AGENCIES IN 
ROME TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGE OF AFRICAN FAMINE AND TO 
ENSURE BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SAFETY AND POTENTIAL 
BENEFITS OF BIOTECH FOODS.

1. (C) HOLY SEE OFFICIALS ARE STILL ASSESSING THE SECRETARY\'S 
UNSC PRESENTATION, AND HAVE INDICATED THEY WILL PROVIDE A 
CONSIDERED RESPONSE AFTER CONFERRING WITH THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER.  THEY SHARE THE U.S. VIEW THAT SADDAM IS A DANGER 
TO THE WORLD, AND HAVE NOW COME TO SEE THE MERITS OF HIS 
REMOVAL.  THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO OPPOSE WAR AS A MEANS TO 
ACHIEVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S OBJECTIVES IN IRAQ, AND 
IS INTENSIFYING ITS DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY TO HEAD OFF WAR. 
FOLLOWING WEEKS OF SPECULATION OF POSSIBLE HOLY SEE 
ENGAGEMENT WITH BAGHDAD, THE VATICAN CONFIRMED FEBRUARY 5 
THAT TARIQ AZIZ WOULD MEET WITH THE POPE FEBRUARY 14.  THE 
HOLY SEE\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINSTER TOLD US THE POPE WOULD URGE 
BAGHDAD TO COMPLY WITH UN RESOLUTIONS TO AVOID WAR, BUT WOULD 
ALSO EXPRESS SOLIDARITY WITH THE SUFFERING OF THE IRAQI 
PEOPLE.  GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER JOSCHKA FISCHER WILL ALSO 
MEET WITH THE POPE FEBRUARY 7 TO DISCUSS IRAQ.  END SUMMARY

2. (C) IN EMBASSY\'S INITIAL CONTACTS WITH THE HOLY SEE 
FOLLOWING THE SECRETARY\'S PRESENTATION TO THE UNSC, VATICAN 
OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY ARE STILL ASSESSING THE 
INFORMATION PROVIDED (WHICH FEW APPEARED TO HAVE WATCHED 
LIVE) AND WOULD OFFER AN OFFICIAL REACTION AFTER CONFERRING 
WITH FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN.  HOWEVER, MIDDLE EAST COUNTRY 
DIRECTOR MONS. FRANCO COPPOLA TOLD POLOFF THAT THE VATICAN 
\"DOES NOT DISAGREE\" THAT SADDAM IS A DANGER BOTH TO HIS

PAGE 03        VATICA  00483  01 OF 02  070959Z 
PEOPLE AND TO THE WORLD, AND SHOULD BE REMOVED.  THIS GOES 
FURTHER THAN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE RECOGNIZED 
SADDAM\'S DANGER, BUT DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF 
HIS DEPARTURE.  COPPOLA ADDED THAT THE HOLY SEE STANDS BY ITS 
VIEW THAT WAR IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO EFFECT CHANGE IN BAGHDAD 
-- THOUGH HE DID NOT OFFER ANY ALTERNATIVE.  PRESSED ON THE 
SPECIFICS OF POWELL\'S PRESENTATION OF SADDAM\'S THREAT, HE 
SAID THE VATICAN DOES NOT HAVE A ROLE IN ASSESSING THE 
VERACITY OR MEANING OF THOSE FACTS -- BUT ASSUMES THE 
INSPECTORS WILL PLAY SUCH A ROLE.  PRESIDENT OF THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL OF JUSTICE AND PEACE RENATO MARTINO TOLD 
VATICAN RADIO THAT THE PRESENTATION WAS \"NOT AN ADLAI 
STEVENSON MOMENT\" AND WOULD NOT CHANGE HIS VIEW ON THE 
NECESSITY OF WAR (THOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED TO THE REPORTED THAT 
HE HAD NOT SEEN THE PRESENTATION AND WAS BASING HIS COMMENTS 
ON TODAY\'S MEDIA REPORTS).

FIGARO HAD REPORTED THAT IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER TARIQ AZIZ 
INFORMED REPORTERS HE WOULD BE MEETING WITH THE POPE FEBRUARY 
14.  THE HOLY SEE WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY AZIZ\'S REVELATION, 
BUT SUBSEQUENTLY CONFIRMED THAT AZIZ WOULD MEET THE POPE AT 
AZIZ\'S REQUEST.  DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER PAROLIN TOLD DCM 
THAT THE POPE WOULD TELL IRAQ TO COLLABORATE \"WITHOUT 
RESERVATION\" WITH THE UN INSPECTORS TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF 
THE INSPECTION PROCESS AND AVOID A WAR.  AT THE SAME TIME, 
THE POPE WOULD ALSO LIKELY EXPRESS HIS SOLIDARITY FOR THE

1998 WHEN AZIZ WAS TOURING EUROPE SEEKING TO LIFT UN 
SANCTIONS) AND WOULD MAKE ANOTHER APPEAL FOR THE WORLD TO 
AVOID WAR.  MEDIA REACTION TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT HAS POINTED 
OUT THAT THE POPE\'S EFFORTS TO WORK WITH IRAQ WHEN HE HAD 
BEEN SEEKING TO VISIT ABRAHAM\'S BIRTHPLACE IN IRAQ DURING THE 
JUBILEE YEAR PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL.  AZIZ WILL ALSO LIKELY MEET 
WITH SECRETARY OF STATE SODANO AND FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN,

CATHOLIC ACTIVIST FATHER JEAN-MARIE BENJAMIN, WHO HAS MADE

INFORMATION PROVIDED (WHICH FEW APPEARED TO HAVE WATCHED

WITH FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN.  HOWEVER, MIDDLE EAST COUNTRY 
DIRECTOR MONS. FRANCO COPPOLA TOLD POLOFF THAT THE VATICAN 
\"DOES NOT DISAGREE\" THAT SADDAM IS A DANGER BOTH TO HIS 
PEOPLE AND TO THE WORLD, AND SHOULD BE REMOVED.  THIS GOES 
FURTHER THAN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE RECOGNIZED 
SADDAM\'S DANGER, BUT DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF 
HIS DEPARTURE.  COPPOLA ADDED THAT THE HOLY SEE STANDS BY ITS 
VIEW THAT WAR IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO EFFECT CHANGE IN BAGHDAD 
-- THOUGH HE DID NOT OFFER ANY ALTERNATIVE.  PRESSED ON THE 
SPECIFICS OF POWELL\'S PRESENTATION OF SADDAM\'S THREAT, HE 
SAID THE VATICAN DOES NOT HAVE A ROLE IN ASSESSING THE 
VERACITY OR MEANING OF THOSE FACTS -- BUT ASSUMES THE 
INSPECTORS WILL PLAY SUCH A ROLE.  PRESIDENT OF THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL OF JUSTICE AND PEACE RENATO MARTINO TOLD 
VATICAN RADIO THAT THE PRESENTATION WAS \"NOT AN ADLAI 
STEVENSON MOMENT\" AND WOULD NOT CHANGE HIS VIEW ON THE 
NECESSITY OF WAR (THOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED TO THE REPORTED THAT 
HE HAD NOT SEEN THE PRESENTATION AND WAS BASING HIS COMMENTS

1.  SUMMARY:  EMBASSY VATICAN HOSTED A ONE-DAY SEMINAR ON 
SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD JANUARY 27

AIMED AT OFFERING AFRICAN PERSPECTIVES ON BIOTECH 
DEVELOPMENTS TO KEY HOLY SEE OFFICIALS, NGO REPRESENTATIVES, 
AND DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES ACCREDITED TO THE HOLY SEE 
FROM MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  THE PANELISTS -- INCLUDING 
FARMERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ACTIVISTS AND SCIENTISTS -- 
MADE CLEAR THEIR BELIEF THAT AFRICA NEEDS TO AVAIL ITSELF OF 
BIOTECH CROPS IN ORDER TO SECURE A HEALTHY AND PROSPEROUS 
FUTURE FOR ITS PEOPLE.  IN THE FACE OF PERSISTENT SUSPICION 
OF ECONOMIC MOTIVES BEHIND U.S. PROMOTION OF BIOTECH FOODS, 
THE COMPELLING MESSAGE ARTICULATED BY THE AFRICAN PANELISTS 
LEFT PARTICIPANTS WITH A CLEAR SENSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR 
BIOTECH FOODS NOT ONLY TO RELIEVE THE CURRENT FAMINE, BUT 
ALSO TO CONTRIBUTE TO MORE EFFICIENT, SELF-SUSTAINING 
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  END 
SUMMARY.

ECONOMIC BENEFITS 
----------------- 
 
2.   CONTINUING EMBASSY VATICAN\'S ADVOCACY FOR BIOTECH FOODS 
WITH THE HOLY SEE AND AFFILIATED AGENCIES (REFTEL), MISSION 
HOSTED A CONFERENCE IN COORDINATION WITH AFRICABIO AND THE 
ITALIAN ASSOCIATION OF BIOTECH COMPANIES AIMED AT BROADENING 
OUR DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE BEYOND IMMEDIATE FAMINE RELIEF 
TO LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF BIOTECH CROPS. 
CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT THE ECONOMIC 
BENEFITS BIOTECH CAN OFFER AFRICA, ASIA AND OTHER DEVELOPING 
AREAS.  ONE SOUTH AFRICAN FARMER AND BIOTECH PIONEER 
(BUTHELIZI) TOLD HIS STORY OF OVERCOMING SKEPTICISM TOWARD 
BIOTECH CROPS THROUGH HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE MORE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00504  01 OF 02  071112Z 
PROFITABLE SEED.  WHEN FIRST OFFERED BIOTECH SEED, HE DECIDED 
TO SPLIT HIS CROP 50-50 BETWEEN BIOTECH AND TRADITIONAL 
MAIZE.  THAT FIRST YEAR, HIS REGION EXPERIENCED HEAVY RAINS 
AND FLOODING WHICH PROVED DISASTROUS FOR HIS TRADITIONAL 
CROPS (EATEN BY PESTS) BUT HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON HIS 
PEST-RESISTANT BIOTECH CROP.  BUTHELIZI AND MOST OF HIS 
NEIGHBORS NOW UTILIZE BIOTECH CROPS, AS THEY PREFER THE 
RELIABLE PRODUCTION AND ABILITY TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. 
RESPONDING TO ONE OF THE FREQUENT ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD 
AGAINST BIOTECH SEEDS, BUTHELIZI SAID IT WAS WORTH THE 
INITIAL HIGHER COSTS TO PURCHASE BIOTECH SEED BECAUSE THE 
BIOTECH PLANTS REQUIRED LESS MANUAL LABOR, FERTILIZER, AND 
PESTICIDES, WHILE PROVIDING HIGHER YIELD CROPS.  AN INDIAN 
COTTON FARMER, JAYAPAL REDDY, ECHOED BUTHELIZI\'S COMMENTS, 
AND INSISTED THAT PEOPLE IN THE WEST SHOULD \"LET THE WISDOM 
OF INDIAN FARMERS DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO USE BIOTECH.\" 
 
3.  BINTONY KUTSAIRA, A MEMBER OF MALAWI\'S PARLIAMENT, 
OUTLINED THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS BIOTECH CROPS WOULD HAVE 
FOR AFRICA.  HE POINTED OUT THAT 80 PERCENT OF AFRICA\'S 
POPULATION IS ENGAGED IN FARMING, BUT CANNOT MANAGE TO 
PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED ITS PEOPLE, WHEREAS, LESS THAN 10 
PERCENT OF EUROPE\'S POPULATION IS ENGAGED IN FARMING YET 
PRODUCES ENOUGH TO MEET ITS OWN DIETARY NEEDS AND EXPORT ON A 
COMMERCIAL SCALE (IN THE U.S. THE FIGURE IS LESS THAN 1 
PERCENT).  KUTSAIRA BLAMED AFRICA\'S CHRONIC UNDERDEVELOPMENT 
IN PART ON THIS LACK OF EFFICIENCY IN THE AGRICULTURAL 
SECTOR.  AS LONG AS SO MANY OF AFRICA\'S PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON 
SUBSISTENCE FARMS, EKING OUT A BASIC LIVING FROM ONE CRISIS 
TO ANOTHER, HE CONCLUDED, AFRICA WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO 
ADVANCE ECONOMICALLY.

PAGE 04        VATICA  00504  01 OF 02  071112Z 
 
4.  REFLECTING THE PERVERSE MENTALITY OF \"SUPPORT\" FROM SOME 
IN THE WEST, ONE JESUIT CURIA REPRESENTATIVE SUGGESTED THAT 
INCREASED AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY FROM BIOTECH CROPS WOULD 
LEAD TO GREATER UNEMPLOYMENT IN AFRICA BY DISPLACING WORKERS 
FROM THE FARMS.  PROFESSOR DIRAN MAKINDE FROM THE UNIVERSITY 
OF VENDA IN SOUTH AFRICA, COUNTERED THAT THE LACK OF 
PRODUCTIVITY WAS LEADING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO DESERT THE 
FARMS FOR CITIES ANYWAY, DESPITE LIMITED PROSPECTS.  GREATER 
PRODUCTIVITY, HE NOTED, WOULD EVENTUALLY ALLOW MORE SKILLED 
WORKERS TO MOVE \"FROM THE FIELD INTO THE FACTORY\" TO PRODUCE 
GOODS WITH A HIGHER ADDED VALUE.  PROFESSOR MAKINDE 
UNDERSCORED HIS FRUSTRATION WITH ARGUMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY 
SAID AFRICA SHOULD REMAIN TRAPPED IN A CHRONIC UNDERDEVELOPED 
STATE.

HEALTH BENEFITS

5.  PANEL MEMBERS ALSO EMPHASIZED POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS 
THAT BIOTECH CROPS WOULD BRING TO AFRICA, NOTING THAT BIOTECH 
FOODS COULD HELP SECURE A CONSISTENT, NUTRITIONAL DIET TO 
HELP IN THE STRUGGLES AGAINST AIDS, MALARIA AND TUBERCULOSIS.

 MP KUTSAIRA POINTED OUT THAT THAT WHILE EUROPEANS HAD THE 
LUXURY OF DEBATING THE PROS AND CONS OF BIOTECH CROPS, 
AFRICANS DID NOT.  HE STRESSED THAT BIOTECH CROPS NEEDED TO 
BE UTILIZED NOW BY AFRICA IN ORDER TO MEET THE DIETARY NEEDS

OF AFRICANS.  THE FARMER,BUTHELIZI, EXPLAINED HOW BIOTECH 
CROPS HAVE LED HIM TO USE FEWER PESTICIDES, SO THAT HE AND 
HIS EMPLOYEES -- AS WELL AS CONSUMERS -- BENEFIT FROM LESS 
EXPOSURE TO THE CHEMICALS.  PROFESSOR MAKINDE CONCLUDED THAT 
AFRICA COULD NOT AFFORD TO MISS OUT ON BIOTECH AS IT HAD 
MISSED THE FIRST \'GREEN REVOLUTION.\' 
 
--------------------------------- 
GETTING FACTS STRAIGHT ON BIOTECH 
--------------------------------- 
 
6.  ALL PANEL MEMBERS AGREED THAT AFRICA AND THE WEST HAVE TO 
GET THEIR FACTS STRAIGHT ON BIOTECH.  MP KUTSAIRA OBSERVED 
THAT AFRICANS NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT FOOD AID IS 
NOT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION; SELF-SUFFICIENCY IS.  PROFESSOR 
L.E. MUMBA OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ZAMBIA, SAID THAT AFRICA HAS 
TO DEVELOP ITS CAPACITY IN BIOTECH RESEARCH, BIOTECH 
MARKETING, AND IN PREDICTING AND ADAPTING TO WEATHER BEFORE 
IT CAN BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT.  PROFESSOR JAMES OCHANDA OF 
THE UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CLARIFYING THE INFORMATION ABOUT BIOTECH FOODS CIRCULATING IN 
AFRICA, ADDING THAT TOO MUCH MISINFORMATION IS BEING SPREAD, 
WHICH IS GENERATING SIGNIFICANT CONFUSION.  PROFESSOR JOCELYN 
WEBSTER, A SOUTH AFRICAN AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AFRICABIO, 
POINTED OUT THAT EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS AND AGRICULTURAL 
LOBBIES HAVE BEEN INFLUENCING AFRICANS FOR YEARS WITH 
INCOMPLETE OR FALSE INFORMATION.  SHE RELATED A PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCE TRYING TO SELL SOUTH AFRICAN BT FEEDCORN TO A 
NAMIBIAN CATTLE OPERATION.  THE NAMIBIANS REFUSED IT BECAUSE 
THEIR EUROPEAN END-USERS HAD SAID THEY WOULD NOT RISK 
IMPORTING BT-FED BEEF GIVEN THE CURRENT ANTI-BIOTECH CLIMATE

PAGE 03        VATICA  00504  02 OF 02  071113Z 
IN EUROPE.  RESPONDING TO THE OFT HEARD ARGUMENT THAT THERE 
WAS NO NEED FOR BIOTECH FOODS BECAUSE THERE IS ENOUGH FOOD IN 
THE WORLD ALREADY, PROFESSOR OCHANDA SAID THAT THE WORLD 
NEEDED TO ACCEPT THAT THE REDISTRIBUTION OF FOOD WAS NOT 
WORKING.  MOST FOOD IS CONSUMED WHERE IT IS GROWN AND 
REDISTRIBUTION IS MORE OF A BAND-AID THAN A SOLUTION FOR THE 
RECURRING CRISES IN AFRICA.  HE LIKENED BIOTECH TO THE KEY 
THAT WOULD FREE AFRICA FROM THE RECURRING CYCLES OF FEAST OR 
FAMINE.  BUTHELIZI SAID THAT THE WORLD, EUROPE IN PARTICULAR, 
NEEDED TO LET AFRICANS USE THEIR OWN JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE 
HOW BEST \"TO FEED OUR PEOPLE.\"

AND WELCOMED THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR \"THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
STORY.\"  WE NOTE THAT BOTH THE JESUITS -- WHO HAVE BEEN THE 
SOURCE OF CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS IN ZAMBIA -- AND CARITAS 
EUROPE HAVE PUBLISHED POSITION PAPERS OPPOSED TO 
BIOTECHNOLOGY IN AFRICA.  THIS MEETING EXPOSED THEIR HEAD 
OFFICES TO THE \"GOOD NEWS\" ON AG-BIOTECH AND ITS POTENTIAL TO 
HELP COMMUNITIES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, AND HOPEFULLY WILL 
FOSTER A REASSESSMENT THAT COULD EVENTUALLY MAKE ITS WAY TO 
THE FIELD.  THE MESSAGE THEY HEARD FROM THE AFRICANS AND 
ASIANS WAS CONSISTENT AND CLEAR:  THEY WANT DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHAT IS IN THEIR OWN BEST 
INTEREST AND THEY WANT AN END TO DESTRUCTIVE OUTSIDE 
INFLUENCES. THEY ALSO MADE A STRONG BID FOR MORE ASSISTANCE

IN DEVELOPING THEIR CAPACITY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. 
WITH 90 PERCENT OF AFRICAN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS DESTINED FOR 
EUROPE, A RECURRING THEME WAS FOR EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TO 
STOP BLOCKING BIOTECH ADVANCEMENTS BY KEEPING THEIR MARKETS 
CLOSED TO BIOTECH PRODUCTS.  TO THE AFRICAN PANELISTS, 
EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS ARE SEEN AS PREVENTING ECONOMIC 
ADVANCEMENT IN AFRICA BY THREATENING TO KEEP AFRICAN BIOTECH 
PRODUCTS OUT OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINSTER ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN 
TOLD VISITING DASD IAN BRZEZINSKI FEBRUARY 7 THAT THE GAP 
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND HOLY SEE\'S POSITION WAS \"NOT THAT BIG,\" 
ADDING THAT THE HOLY SEE AGREES THAT THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE 
FOR SADDAM AND THAT HE NEEDS TO COOPERATE.  FOR THE HOLY SEE, 
THE POINT OF DIVERGENCE WITH THE U.S. WAS \"WHETHER WAR WAS 
THE ANSWER\" TO THE SITUATION, AND, IF IT WAS, WHO WOULD MAKE 
THE DECISION FOR WAR.  TAURAN EMPHASIZED THAT THE HOLY SEE 
BELIEVES ONLY THE UN CAN MAKE THAT DECISION, AND HE STRONGLY 
ENCOURAGED THE U.S. TO SEEK A SECOND UN RESOLUTION.  DASD 
BRZEZINSKI URGED TAURAN TO ENSURE IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER 
TARIQ AZIZ RECEIVED A CLEAR MESSAGE FROM THE POPE FEBRUARY 14 
THAT IRAQ HAD LITTLE TIME TO DEMONSTRATE ITS WILLINGNESS TO 
DISARM.  TAURAN SAID THE HOLY SEE HAS ALREADY CONVEYED THAT 
MESSAGE TO THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR AND WOULD REPEAT IT TO AZIZ. 
TAURAN STRESSED TO BRZEZINSKI THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT 
WAR, IF IT CAME, WOULD NOT BE PORTRAYED AS AN AMERICAN WAR, 
BUT AS AN INTERNATIONAL OPERATION TO RESPOND TO THE 
\"MISBEHAVIOR\" OF A UN MEMBER GOVERNMENT.  IN THIS REGARD, HE 
SUGGESTED THAT ANY MILITARY ACTION BE CAST AS A \"POLICE 
ACTION\" AS A WAY TO REINFORCE THE NEED FOR THE ACTION AND 
MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE INTERNATIONALLY.  BRZEZINSKI ASSURED 
TAURAN THAT THE U.S. WOULD ACT IN AN BROAD COALITION.  END 
SUMMARY.

2. (C) IN A FEBRUARY 7 MEETING, DASD IAN BRZEZINSKI (IN ROME 
WITH SECRETARY RUMSFELD\'S DELEGATION) ACCOMPANIED BY 
AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON EMPHASIZED TO HOLY SEE\' FOREIGN MINISTER 
JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN THAT THE UNITED STATES REGARDS WAR AS THE 
\"LAST RESORT\" TO DISARM IRAQ, BUT STRESSED THE URGENCY OF 
ACTION IN THE FACE OF THE DANGEROUS NEXUS BETWEEN TERRORISM 
AND IRAQ\'S WMD CAPABILITIES.  HE NOTED THAT SECRETARY 
POWELL\'S UN PRESENTATION MADE CLEAR THAT SADDAM CONTINUED TO 
DEVELOP HIS WMD CAPABILITIES, DESPITE HIS COMMITMENT TO 
DISARM, WHICH LEFT \"NO ROOM FOR ERROR.\"  HE EMPHASIZED THAT 
UNSC 1441 WAS A FINAL RESOLUTION THAT LEFT SADDAM NO ROOM TO 
ONCE AGAIN FLOUT THE WILL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
3. (C) IN THE FACE OF A STEADY DRUMBEAT OF MEDIA REPORTS 
SUGGESTING UNYIELDING VATICAN OPPOSITION TO WAR, TAURAN WENT 
OUR OF HIS WAY TO EMPHASIZE THE COMMON GROUND IN THE U.S. AND 
HOLY SEE\'S PERCEPTIONS OF THE IRAQ CRISIS.  \"THE GAP IS NOT 
SO BIG,\" HE ASSERTED, NOTING THAT THAT HOLY SEE AGREES THAT 
THIS IS SADDAM\'S \"LAST CHANCE\" AND THAT HE NEEDS TO COOPERATE 
IMMEDIATELY.  HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT BOTH THE UN AND HOLY 
SEE HAVE EMPHASIZED THE CENTRAL ROLE OF THE UN IN RESOLVING 
THE CONFLICT -- WHICH THE HOLY SEE REGARDS AS ESSENTIAL. 
\"THE POINT OF DIVERGENCE,\" HE CONTINUED, \"IS WAR.\"  BUT IN 
OUTLINING THE VATICAN POSITION, HE DID NOT ASSERT -- AS OTHER 
SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE CURIA HAVE RECENTLY -- THAT THE HOLY 
SEE IS COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO WAR AT ANY POINT.  RATHER, HE 
SAID THE CRUCIAL ISSUE WAS WHO WILL SAY, \"THE GAME IS OVER,\" 
AND WHEN THAT DECISION SHOULD BE MADE.  IN ADDITION, HE NOTED 
THAT THE HOLY SEE REMAINED DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00523  01 OF 02  100629Z 
POSITION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, AND STILL NEEDED TO BE 
CONVINCED THAT WAR IS THE ONLY SOLUTION.  HE ALSO REITERATED 
THE HOLY SEE\'S FEAR FOR THE REACTION OF THE ARAB WORLD, 
CITING ARAB LEAGUE HEAD AMR MOUSSA\'S LINE THAT \"THE DOORS OF 
HELL WILL OPEN.\" 
 
-------------------------- 
\"NOT ONLY AN AMERICAN WAR\" 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C) IN HIS EFFORT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING 
THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS, TAURAN EMPHASIZED THAT IT WAS 
ESSENTIAL FOR THE U.S. TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ANY WAR WOULD NOT 
BE \"AN AMERICAN WAR,\" BUT AN INTERNATIONAL ACTION.  HE 
REGRETTED THAT THE POPULAR PERCEPTION IN EUROPE AND MUCH OF 
THE WORLD REMAINED THAT THIS WAS AN AMERICAN CONCERN NOT 
SHARED BROADLY.  \"IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DEEMS THAT 
THE TIME IS RIGHT,\" HE OBSERVED, \"THEN THE COMMUNITY AS A 
WHOLE SHOULD TAKE ACTION.\"  TO MAKE THIS CASE, HOWEVER, HE 
BELIEVED AN ADDITIONAL UN RESOLUTION WOULD BE INDISPENSABLE. 
DASD BRZEZINSKI COUNTERED THAT THE U.S. BELIEVED UNSC 1441 
PROVIDED ADEQUATE AUTHORITY TO UNDERTAKE MILITARY ACTION.

SUBJECT: IRAQ: DASD BRZEZINSKI\'S MEETING WITH HOLY SEE FM 
TAURAN:  VATICAN STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF ADDITIONAL UN 
RESOLUTION 
 
WITHOUT DISPUTING THAT, TAURAN INSISTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL 
RESOLUTION \"WOULD BE BETTER.\"  BRZEZINSKI ALSO ASSURED TAURAN 
THAT ANY ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A 
BROAD INTERNATIONAL COALITION.  HE NOTED THAT ONLY THE DAY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00523  02 OF 02  100630Z 
BEFORE TEN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAD 
AFFIRMED THEIR SUPPORT FOR ACTION, JOINING THE EIGHT 
EUROPEANS WHO HAD SIGNED THE EARLIER LETTER OF SUPPORT. 
 
5. (C) REFLECTING THE HOLY SEE\'S SENSITIVITY ABOUT THE TERM 
\'WAR,\' TAURAN WONDERED ALOUD WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE BETTER 
TO CHARACTERIZE ANY MILITARY ACTION AS AN INTERNATIONAL 
\"POLICE ACTION.\"  HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING THE 
POINT THAT ANY ACTION WOULD NOT BE DIRECTED AGAINST THE IRAQI 
PEOPLE, BUT AGAINST A GOVERNMENT THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT HAD \"MISBEHAVED.\"  THIS WOULD 
REINFORCE THE COMMUNAL RESPONSIBILITY OF ANY ACTION, HE 
BELIEVED. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
CLEARING UP MISUNDERSTANDINGS ON INSPECTIONS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) TAURAN SOUGHT TO CLARIFY WITH BRZEZINSKI THE HOLY 
SEE\'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE INSPECTION PROCESS.  TAURAN SAID 
THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HANS BLIX HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER IRAQ WAS COOPERATING, BUT HE WAS UNCLEAR 
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE THE PROOF -- BLIX OR IRAQ. 
BRZEZINSKI MADE CLEAR THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY RESIDES WITH 
IRAQ, WHICH MUST FULLY COOPERATE, BUT HAS INSTEAD CONTINUED 
TO DECEIVE.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT INSPECTORS ARE 
NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING UNDER EVERY ROCK, BUT ARE SIMPLY 
SUPPOSED TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION FREELY PROVIDED BY IRAQ. 
TAURAN THEN ASKED IF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS 
WOULD STRENGTHEN THE SUCCESS OF INSPECTIONS.  BRZEZINSKI MADE 
CLEAR THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF WILLING COOPERATION, NO NUMBER 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00523  02 OF 02  100630Z 
OF INSPECTORS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL.

DELIVERING A MESSAGE TO TARIQ AZIZ 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) FOLLOWING UP THE FEBRUARY 5 ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IRAQI 
FOREIGN MINISTER TARIQ AZIZ WOULD MEET THE POPE FEBRUARY 14, 
THE AMBASSADOR URGED TAURAN TO DELIVER A FIRM MESSAGE TO AZIZ 
THAT THE TIME FOR SADDAM TO GO HAD ARRIVED.  HE NOTED THAT, 
IN THE ABSENCE OF SADDAM\'S DEPARTURE, HE SAW LITTLE CHANCE TO 
AVOID WAR.  TAURAN RESPONDED THAT HE HAD ALREADY CONVEYED TO 
THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE THE MESSAGE THAT \"THIS 
IS NOT A GAME,\" AND THAT IRAQ NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH THE UN 
RESOLUTIONS IMMEDIATELY.  HE PLEDGED TO DELIVER THE SAME 
MESSAGE TO AZIZ NEXT WEEK.

COMMENT

8. (C) IN THE FACE OF EXTENSIVE MEDIA COVERAGE GIVEN TO PAPAL 
AND OTHER CURIAL STATEMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO WAR, TAURAN WENT 
OUT OF HIS WAY TO CONVEY THAT THE HOLY SEE DID NOT REGARD 
ITSELF AS OPPOSING THE U.S., BUT RATHER SHARED U.S. CONCERNS 
ON IRAQ.  WHILE HE REITERATED THE HOLY SEE\'S STRONG DESIRE TO 
AVOID WAR, HIS STATEMENTS REFLECTED AN EVEN GREATER 
UNDERSTANDING THAN WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SEEN THAT WAR MAY BE 
UNAVOIDABLE.  IN FACT, HIS POSITION STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST 
TO A HOLY SEE-SANCTIONED ARTICLE -- APPROVED BY TAURAN -- 
OPPOSING WAR IN IRAQ AND THE CONCEPT OF PREVENTIVE WAR, WHICH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00523  02 OF 02  100630Z 
WAS PUBLISHED IN CIVILTA CATTOLICA TWO MONTHS AGO (REFTEL), 
AND WHICH VATICAN OFFICIALS HAVE REPEATEDLY TOLD US REFLECTS 
OFFICIAL VIEWS.  BOTH PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY, HOWEVER, TAURAN 
HAS BEEN CONSISTENT FOR MANY MONTHS THAT WAR CONDUCTED WITHIN 
THE UN FRAMEWORK COULD BE CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE.  WE BELIEVE 
HIS PREVIOUS AND MOST RECENT STATEMENTS PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK 
WITHIN WHICH WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD BROADER ACCEPTANCE FROM 
THE HOLY SEE FOR ANY EVENTUAL MILITARY ACTION. 
 
9.  (C) DASD BRZEZINSKI DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR 
THIS MESSAGE.

PHARMACEUTICAL ACCESS FOR THE NEEDIEST COUNTRIES, BUT 
REITERATED THEIR DESIRE TO SEE AN AGREEMENT REACHED AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THE DOHA DECLARATION. 
 
2.  MONSIGNOR NEVES WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO EXPLAIN THAT 
FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN\'S DECEMBER NOTE VERBALE URGING THE 
U.S. NOT TO BLOCK CONSENSUS ON DOHA (REF C) WAS THE RESULT OF 
PRESSURE ON THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION IN GENEVA FROM \"A NUMBER 
OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES\" AND REFLECTED THE HOLY SEE\'S 
PERCEPTION AT THAT TIME THE USG WAS BLOCKING CONCLUSION OF A 
FINAL AGREEMENT.  THEY SAID THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY OTHER 
COUNTRIES WITH R AND D INTERESTS WERE WILLING TO SUPPORT THE 
TEXT, WHILE THE U.S. WAS NOT.  THE HOLY SEE NOW HAS A MORE 
COMPLETE APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. POSITION, HOWEVER, AND 
BOTH OFFICIALS REPEATED THAT THE U.S. TRIPS ENFORCEMENT 
MORATORIUM WAS A \"VERY IMPORTANT\" MEASURE.  PAROLIN AND NEVES 
UNDERSCORED THAT THE HOLY SEE WAS \"PLEASED\" WITH THE FACT 
THAT THE USG WAS GOING AHEAD WITH THE MORATORIUM IMMEDIATELY 
AND HAD BEEN JOINED BY THE EU. 
 
3.  LOOKING TO THE NEXT ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS IN GENEVA, 
NEVES SAID THE HOLY SEE WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS FROM A 
PRINCIPLED HUMANITARIAN POSITION FOR A FINAL AGREEMENT ON 
IMPLEMENTING DOHA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  NEVES OFFERED THAT 
THE DISCUSSIONS HAD REACHED A \"TECHNICAL LEVEL\" AT WHICH HE 
BELIEVED MIDDLE GROUND COULD BE REACHED QUICKLY.  ASKED WHAT 
INSTRUCTIONS THE HOLY SEE WOULD SEND ARCHBISHOP DIARMUID 
MARTIN, ITS GENEVA PERMANENT OBSERVER, THEY SAID HE WOULD 
RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO \"PRESS ALL SIDES TO REACH A FINAL

WILL SEEK TO REVIEW THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION ON TRIPS WITH HIM 
AT THAT TIME.) 
 
4.  IN CONCLUDING, DEPUTY FM PAROLIN, IN AN EFFORT TO SMOOTH 
OVER DIFFERENCES ARISING FROM THE CRITICAL STANCE THEY HAD 
ADOPTED IN DECEMBER (REFS B AND C), INTERJECTED THAT THE HOLY 
SEE \"WANTED TO STRESS THAT IT IS HAPPY AND SUPPORTS\" THE 
PRESIDENT\'S STATE OF THE UNION ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE USG 
WOULD INCREASE HIV/AIDS FUNDING BY USD 10 BILLION.   HE ALSO 
NOTED THAT THE HOLY SEE IS AWARE THAT AMERICAN PRIVATE SECTOR 
SUPPORT FOR HUMANITARIAN AND MEDICAL RELIEF IN THE DEVELOPING 
WORLD IS AN IMPORTANT, ALBEIT SOMETIMES OVERLOOKED, 
CONTRIBUTION.  (NOTE; THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S CONTRIBUTION IS 
ALSO IMPORTANT AND OFTEN OVERLOOKED -- IT PROVIDES NEARLY 25

SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST 
-------------------------- 
 
1. (C) THE HOLY SEE\'S MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR, MONSIGNOR FRANCO 
COPPOLA, WHO ACCOMPANIED PAPAL SPECIAL ENVOY CARDINAL ROGER 
ETCHEGARAY TO BAGHDAD, GAVE DCM A FULL READOUT FEBRUARY 19 OF 
ETCHEGARAY\'S VISIT AND FEBRUARY 15 MEETING WITH SADDAM 
HUSSEIN.  ACCORDING TO COPPOLA, THE PAPAL MISSION TO BAGHDAD 
WAS UNDERTAKEN BOTH TO REINFORCE WITH SADDAM THE SERIOUSNESS 
OF HIS SITUATION AND HIS NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY TO COOPERATE 
FULLY WITH UNMOVIC, WHILE ALSO SEEKING TO \"CREATE A SENSE OF 
TRUST\" WITH SADDAM THAT THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES COULD HELP THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ACHIEVE ITS GOAL OF IRAQI DISARMAMENT 
WITHOUT RECOURSE TO WAR.  ON THE BASIS OF THE VISIT, THE HOLY 
SEE BELIEVES THAT FIRM, BUT NON-CONFRONTATIONAL, DIPLOMACY 
THAT AVOIDS \"HUMILIATING\" SADDAM CAN ACHIEVE IRAQ\'S 
DISARMAMENT WITHOUT RESORT TO A WAR THAT THEY FEAR WOULD 
INFLAME FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAM WITH \"INCALCULABLE 
CONSEQUENCES.\"  COPPOLA VOICED THE HOLY SEE\'S CONCERN AT HOW 
RECENT TRANSATLANTIC DIVISIONS AND A PERCEPTION OF DIVISION 
BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND THE U.S. HAVE PLAYED OUT IN THE 
PRESS.  THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED THUS FAR 
WITH IRAQ IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE CREDIBLE THREAT OF FORCE 
AND INTERNATIONAL UNITY, AND THEY WORRY THAT PERCEPTIONS OF 
DIVISION WILL UNDERMINE THE PRESSURE ON SADDAM.  WITH PM 
BLAIR SET TO MEET THE POPE FEBRUARY 22, EMBASSY BELIEVES A 
HIGH-LEVEL U.S. VISIT TO THE HOLY SEE COULD HELP REINFORCE

ETCHEGARAY DELIVERS POPE\'S MESSAGE TO SADDAM

2.  (C)  HOLY SEE MFA MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR MONS. FRANCO 
COPPOLA GAVE DCM AND POLOFF A DETAILED READOUT FEBRUARY 19 OF 
HIS WEEK-LONG TRIP TO BAGHDAD WITH PAPAL SPECIAL ENVOY 
CARDINAL ROGER ETCHEGARAY.  COPPOLA TOLD US THE TRIP WAS 
UNDERTAKEN TO IMPRESS UPON SADDAM THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND TO URGE HIS FULL AND IMMEDIATE 
COOPERATION WITH UNSCR 1441.  COPPOLA EMPHASIZED THAT THE 
HOLY SEE BELIEVES SADDAM HAS THUS FAR BEEN TOO PRONE TO 
PREVARICATION AND DECEPTION, AND THAT THE TRIP WAS SEEN BY 
THE VATICAN AS ITS LAST BEST CHANCE TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO 
SADDAM AND AVERT A WAR.  RECOGNIZING THE \"DICTATOR\'S 
MENTALITY\" THEY WOULD ENCOUNTER IN DELIVERING SUCH A MESSAGE, 
ETCHEGARAY SOUGHT NOT TO CHALLENGE SADDAM DIRECTLY, BUT TO 
GIVE HIM A SENSE THAT, BY WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY TO MEET ITS DEMANDS FOR DISARMAMENT, HE COULD ALSO 
ACHIEVE WHAT HE WANTS (CONTINUED POWER).  ETCHEGARAY DID IN 
FACT UNDERSCORE TO SADDAM THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION 
AND THE NEED TO WORK WITH UNMOVIC, TO WHICH SADDAM\'S 
IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS BOTH DEFIANT AND FATALISTIC.  HE 
OFFERED THE STANDARD LINE THAT IRAQ WAS COMPLYING, THAT THE 
U.S. WAS PURSUING A WAR OF AGGRESSION, AND THAT IRAQIS WOULD 
FIGHT TO THE END.

DEALING WITH THE \"DICTATOR MENTALITY\" 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) DESPITE SADDAM\'S SURFACE OBSTINACY, HOWEVER, THE HOLY 
SEE BELIEVES THE INTERNATIONAL UNITY AND FIRM DIPLOMACY 
BACKED BY A CREDIBLE THREAT OF FORCE FROM THE U.S. AND OTHERS 
HAS CONTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANT, IF INCOMPLETE, ADVANCES SINCE 
THE FALL, REFLECTED BY SADDAM\'S ACCEPTANCE OF UNMOVIC, THE 
DECISION TO PERMIT OVERFLIGHTS, AND RECENT MOVEMENT ON 
PRIVATE INTERVIEWS WITH IRAQI SCIENTISTS.  THEY BELIEVE THAT 
FULL DISARMAMENT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH CONTINUED FIRM BUT 
SUBTLE DIPLOMACY THAT WOULD OFFER SADDAM BOTH A FACE-SAVING 
ESCAPE FROM HIS PREDICAMENT AND PERSONAL SURVIVAL.  ACCORDING 
TO COPPOLA, THE KEY TO PROGRESS IN IRAQ WAS TO RECOGNIZE THAT 
CORNERED DICTATORS LIKE SADDAM WILL DIG IN WHEN CONFRONTED. 
\"THEY ARE NOT USED TO DISCUSSING THINGS AND BEING 
CHALLENGED,\" COPPOLA OBSERVED.  \"IF YOU WANT TO GET THINGS 
FROM THEM, THEY CANNOT BE HUMILIATED.\"  RATHER, THE HOLY SEE 
REGARDS IT AS ESSENTIAL TO ESTABLISH A DEGREE OF \"TRUST\" -- 
\"NOT TRUST OF SADDAM TO BE SURE\" -- BUT THE KIND OF 
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN BUSINESSMEN THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN 
IT FOR EVERYONE IF ALL PLAY BY THE RULES.  IN THIS WAY,

SEES \"LAST CHANCE FOR DIPLOMACY\"

PAGE 02        VATICA  00683  02 OF 03  200658Z 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTS AND THE SURVIVAL SADDAM SEEKS. 
 
4. (C) TO BACK UP THIS CASE, THE HOLY SEE VIEWS THE FACT THAT 
SADDAM CONVENED HIS RUBBER-STAMP PARLIAMENT ON THE FRIDAY 
CONCLUDING THE HADJ TO PROMULGATE THE LAW BANNING WMD (WHICH 
WAS SUGGESTED BY ETCHEGARAY AT THE HOLY SEE\'S REQUEST) AS A 
SIGN OF SADDAM\'S WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  WORKING DISCRETELY RATHER THAN 
DIRECTLY WITH SADDAM, ETCHEGARAY HAD PRESSED THE IRAQIS TO 
OFFER SOME SORT OF SIGN THAT THEY HAD ABANDONED EFFORTS TO 
\"NEGOTIATE\" COMPLIANCE WITH THE I/C AND TO BUILD ON THEIR 
LIMITED COOPERATION BEFORE HANS BLIX\' FEBRUARY 14 REPORT TO 
THE UNSC.  THE HOLY SEE REGARDS THIS RESULT -- DESPITE ITS 
LIMITED EFFECT -- AS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF IRAQI WILLINGNESS 
TO COOPERATE IF NOT BACKED INTO A CORNER. 
 
---------------- 
WHAT DO WE WANT? 
---------------- 
 
5. (C) IN DETERMINING THE WAY FORWARD, COPPOLA SAID THE 
APPROACH DEPENDED ON THE REAL GOAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY.  IF THE GOAL IS TO REMOVE SADDAM, THEN HE AGREED 
THAT WAR IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND QUICKEST METHOD.  HOWEVER, 
THE WORLD MUST THEN BE PREPARED TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
THIS DECISION -- WHICH COULD INCLUDE LOSS OF CONTROL OF 
SADDAM\'S WMD TO TERRORISTS IN THE CHAOS OF BATTLE OR ITS 
IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH, DEATH OF ALLIED SOLDIERS AND IRAQI 
CIVILIANS, ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION, AND, MOST WORRISOME TO 
THE HOLY SEE, THE UNLEASHING OF EVER GREATER FUNDAMENTALIST 
PASSIONS WITH \"INCALCULABLE CONSEQUENCES.\"  IF, ON THE OTHER 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00683  02 OF 03  200658Z 
HAND, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY GENUINELY SEEKS TO DISARM 
IRAQ OF WMD, SUBTLE DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE THAT DOESN\'T 
\"HUMILIATE\" SADDAM CAN WORK, COPPOLA BELIEVED.  HE ASSERTED 
THAT EVER GREATER PRESSURE FROM INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING 
WOULD INCREASINGLY HINDER SADDAM\'S ABILITY TO POSE A THREAT. 
FURTHERMORE, HE MAINTAINED THAT STEPPED UP INTELLIGENCE AND 
LAW ENFORCEMENT, AS WELL AS OCCASIONAL \"SURGICAL STRIKES\" ON 
SUSPECTED WEAPONS SITES WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ALL-OUT 
WAR IN ACHIEVING DISARMAMENT WITHOUT GENERATING CHAOS THAT 
COULD LEAD TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WMD FROM IRAQ.  PRESSED ON 
THIS POINT, COPPOLA ASSERTED THAT WAR WOULD CAUSE SUCH CHAOS 
IN IRAQ (WHICH HE ALREADY CHARACTERIZED AS A HOPELESSLY 
DISORGANIZED SOCIETY) THAT ANY WMD NOT IMMEDIATELY DESTROYED 
WOULD SURELY BE SPIRITED AWAY TO PRECISELY THOSE PLAYERS 
(INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS) MOST LIKELY TO USE THEM. 
 
6. (C) IN THE DISARMAMENT SCENARIO, COPPOLA OBSERVED, GAINING 
IRAQI COOPERATION WOULD REQUIRE BUILDING SOME TRUST AND 
CONFIDENCE, WHICH IS WHAT THE ETCHEGARAY MISSION HOPED TO 
BEGIN.  \"THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE FORWARD IS AWAY FROM THE TV 
CAMERAS, TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND.\"  HE NOTED THAT EVEN THE 
WORST PEOPLE OFTEN BELIEVE THEY ARE GOOD, THAT THEY ARE 
FOLLOWING THE RIGHT AND JUST PATH, OR, IN SADDAM\'S CASE, THAT 
HE IS COLLABORATING.  ETCHEGARAY\'S MISSION, COPPOLA 
CONCLUDED, SOUGHT TO CREATE AN OPENING TO CONVINCE SADDAM 
THAT HE COULD OBTAIN WHAT HE WANTS BETTER IN COLLABORATION 
WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RATHER THAN IN CONFRONTATION 
WITH IT.  THAT SAID, THE HOLY SEE RECOGNIZES THAT TIME IS NOT 
ON THE SIDE OF PEACE UNLESS SADDAM ACCEPTS THE NEED TO 
COOPERATE FULLY. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

THE MOOD IN BAGHDAD 
------------------- 
 
7. (C)  ASKED HIS IMPRESSIONS OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITION 
OF IRAQIS HE MET WHILE IN BAGHDAD, COPPOLA SAID THEY ARE 
\"RESIGNED TO WAR, FATALISTIC IN THE ARAB WAY.\"  HE SAID MANY 
APPEAR TO WANT TO LEAVE, AND ARE MAKING PLANS TO DO SO, BUT 
THAT THE REGIME HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE - IN ORDER TO HAVE AS 
MANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AS POSSIBLE SHOULD WAR ERUPT.  GIVEN 
THE RISKS IRAQI CIVILIANS WOULD FACE, COPPOLA INFORMED US 
THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD DECIDED NOT TO RESPOND TO A J5 REQUEST 
CONVEYED TO THEM TO LIST AND IDENTIFY HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC AND 
OTHER CATHOLIC SITES ON SATELLITE IMAGERY.  COPPOLA SAID \"WE 
CANNOT SAY IT\'S NOT \'OK\' TO BOMB HERE, BUT IT IS \'OK\' TO BOMB 
THERE.\"

THE DANGERS PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND OF AN

YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
 
YOU ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE AWARE THAN ANY ONE ELSE THAT THE 
WORLD TODAY IS ON THE BRINK OF A DESTRUCTIVE WAR WHICH THOUGH 
CONCENTRATED ON ONE REGION MIGHT LEAD TO A GLOBAL 
CONFLAGRATION. WE RECOGNIZE PERFECTLY THE IMPORTANCE OF WORLD 
COOPERATION TO ELIMINATE ALL KINDS OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION WHEREVER THEY MAY BE FOUND WITHOUT 
DISCRIMINATION. WE APPRECIATE ALSO THE URGENT NEED TO COMBAT 
TERRORISM AND PUT AN END TO THE CULTURE OF TERRORISM WHEREVER 
IT MAY EXIST. AT THE SAME TIME WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TASK IS 
COMPLICATED. IT REQUIRES THE BACKING OF AN INTERNATIONAL 
CONSENSUS, BOTH OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL. MORE TIME IS NEEDED 
TO BRING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO ROOT OUT THE 
CULTURE OF TERROR AND TO ESTABLISH A CULTURE OF LOVE, 
SECURITY AND PEACE FOR THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY INCLUDING FUTURE 
GENERATIONS. 
 
WE THEREFORE URGE YOU, AS WE URGE BY A SIMILAR LETTER H.E. 
PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR AND H.E. PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN, 
AND AS WE WOULD URGE EVERY WORLD LEADER, TO FOREGO THE OPTION 
OF WAR AS A WAY OF ACHIEVING THESE NOBLE GOALS. THE OPTION OF 
WAR WOULD ONLY COMPLICATE MATTERS FURTHER, SINCE IT WOULD

OUR SOLE INTENTION IS TO SAVE HUMANITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
FROM A TERRIBLE DISASTER. WE WISH TO ASSURE YOU THAT

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) DURING A FEBRUARY 22 PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE 
AND SUBSEQUENT MEETING WITH VATICAN SECRETARY OF STATE 
SODANO, UK PRIME MINISTER BLAIR OUTLINED TO THE HOLY SEE HIS 
VIEWS ON THE NEED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DISARM 
SADDAM HUSSEIN.  THE POPE AND HIS SENIOR ADVISORS REPORTEDLY 
CONVEYED THEIR VIEW THAT DISARMAMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT 
RECOURSE TO MILITARY ACTION.  BOTH SIDES AGREED ON THE 
CENTRALITY OF THE UN\'S ROLE, THE IMPORTANCE OF RESOLVING THE 
ISSUE OF IRAQ\'S POSSESSION OF WMD, AND THE NEED TO ENSURE 
THAT THIS ISSUE DOES NOT LEAD TO NEW DIVISIONS IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
PRIVATE MEETING TURNED PUBLIC 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C) PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR MEET WITH THE POPE FOR A 
HALF HOUR IN A PRIVATE AUDIENCE FEBRUARY 22, FOLLOWED BY AN 
HOUR-LONG MEETING WITH VATICAN SECRETARY OF STATE SODANO AND 
FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN.  BLAIR\'S PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE 
POPE WAS NOT ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL 
MEETING, BUT RATHER A PRIVATE FAMILY VISIT.  (BLAIR\'S WIFE 
AND CHILDREN ARE CATHOLIC, AND HAD WANTED TO MEET THE POPE.) 
THE TIMING WAS DETERMINED NOT BY THE PRESSURE OVER IRAQ, BUT 
BY THE COINCIDENCE OF A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED MEETING IN ROME 
WITH ITALIAN PM BERLUSCONI (REF C) AND THE BLAIR CHILDREN\'S 
SCHOOL HOLIDAYS.  UK AMBASSADOR COLVIN (PROTECT) SAID THE UK 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00806  01 OF 02  261603Z 
AND HOLY SEE HAD AGREED THE BLAIR-POPE MEETING WOULD BE 
PRIVATE WITHOUT THE CUSTOMARY POST-MEETING PRESS RELEASE. 
THE HOLY SEE DID NOT HONOR THIS, HOWEVER, AS PAPAL SPOKESMAN 
NAVARRO-VALLS PROVIDED THE PRESS WITH A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE 
KEY POINTS OF THE TWO MEETINGS WITH \"THE VATICAN\'S SPIN.\" 
 
---------------------------------------- 
IRAQ:  AVOID DIVISIONS; KEEP FOCUS ON UN 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN PRESS SUMMARY AND THE UK 
AMBASSADOR, WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE SECOND MEETING, BUT NOT 
THE PAPAL AUDIENCE, THE THREE AGREED SUBJECTS WERE IRAQ, THE 
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT, AND THE EU CONSTITUTION.  ON 
IRAQ, THE AMBASSADOR SAID PM BLAIR LAID OUT HIS VIEWS -- 
WHICH SHE SAID WOULD BE VERY FAMILIAR TO OUR EMBASSY IN 
LONDON -- ON THE NEED TO DISARM SADDAM AND TO ENSURE THE UN 
MET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES.  THE POPE AND HIS COLLABORATORS IN 
TURN OUTLINED THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEW THAT \"ALL INTERESTED 
PARTIES IN THE IRAQI CRISIS NEED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE 
ORGANIZATION OF THE UN AND KNOW HOW TO USE THE RESOURCES 
OFFERED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW IN ORDER TO AVERT THE TRAGEDY OF 
WAR,\" WHICH THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IS AVOIDABLE. 
BOTH SIDES AGREED THAT THE UN ROLE SHOULD BE CENTRAL, BUT 
DIFFERED OVER THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR RECOURSE TO FORCE IF 
SADDAM FAILED TO COMPLY.  THE HOLY SEE ALSO EMPHASIZED TO 
BLAIR ITS STANDARD VIEW THAT \"SPECIAL CONSIDERATION\" BE GIVEN 
TO THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, \"ALREADY 
SO SEVERELY TRIED BY THE LONG YEARS OF EMBARGO.\" 
 
4. (C) WHAT WAS NEW IN THE HOLY SEE\'S PUBLIC PRESENTATION OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00806  01 OF 02  261603Z 
THE ISSUE FOLLOWING THE MEETINGS WITH BLAIR WAS ITS CLEAR 
RECOGNITION OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION IN IRAQ -- 
WHICH WE HAVE HEARD PRIVATELY, BUT HAS BEEN MORE MUTED IN THE 
VATICAN\'S PUBLIC TREATMENT OF IRAQ.  THIS WAS ALSO REFLECTED 
IN THE HOLY SEE UN PERMREP\'S PRESENTATION BEFORE THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL IN WHICH HE OBSERVED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
IS \"RIGHTLY WORRIED AND ADDRESSING A JUST AND URGENT CAUSE\" 
IN DISARMING ARSENALS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  THE SECOND NEW 
ELEMENT WAS THE CONCERN EXPRESSED BY THE HOLY SEE ABOUT 
ENSURING THAT IN DEALING WITH THE IRAQ CRISIS, \"EVERY EFFORT 
BE MADE TO AVOID NEW DIVISIONS IN THE WORLD.\"  THIS REFLECTS 
THE VATICAN\'S CONCERN BOTH FOR POTENTIAL DIVISIONS BETWEEN 
THE MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN WORLDS, AS WELL AS DIVISIONS WITHIN 
THE WEST ITSELF. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
NEED TO MOVE AHEAD ON ISRAEL-PALESTINE

7. (C) DESPITE THE PRIVATE ORIGINS AND NATURE OF THE VISIT, 
THE MEDIA HAS SEIZED ON THE VISIT -- WITH ENCOURAGEMENT FROM 
THE HOLY SEE -- AS A REFLECTION OF THE POPE\'S CONTINUING 
CENTRAL ROLE AS A SOURCE OF MORAL INFLUENCE ON THE CURRENT 
INTERNATIONAL DEBATE OVER IRAQI DISARMAMENT.  BLAIR\'S VISIT 
FOLLOWED CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF PAPAL AUDIENCES WITH KOFI 
ANNAN, TARIQ AZIZ (REF B), AND JOSCHKA FISCHER, AS WELL AS 
CARDINAL ETCHEGARAY\'S MEETING WITH SADDAM (REF A), AND IT 
PRECEDES VISITS THIS WEEK OF SPANISH PRIME MINISTER AZNAR AND 
IRAN\'S  PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER MOHAMMED REZA KHATAMI.  THE 
POPE\'S TOP OFFICIALS ALSO CLOSETED WITH ITALIAN PRESIDENT 
CIAMPI AND PM BERLUSCONI FEBRUARY 17 IN AN ANNUAL MEETING IN 
WHICH IRAQ WAS A MAIN TOPIC OF CONVERSATION.  AS THEY HAVE 
POINTED OUT TO US, (REFS A AND B), THE VATICAN ACKNOWLEDGES 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00806  02 OF 02  261603Z 
THE RIGHTNESS OF OUR CAUSE IN DEALING WITH SADDAM\'S WMD AND 
ACKNOWLEDGES THEIR DANGER, BUT CANNOT YET BRING ITSELF TO 
ACCEPT THAT RESORT TO FORCE IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD.  THIS 
REFLECTS BOTH A WIDELY ACCEPTED VIEW WITHIN SOME CHURCH 
CIRCLES THAT WAR IS AN IMMORAL AND INEFFECTIVE MEANS TO 
RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS, AND MORE PRAGMATIC CONCERNS 
FOR THE IMPACT OF WAR ON CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM RELATIONS IN 
GENERAL AND ON CATHOLIC POPULATIONS IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN 
PARTICULAR. 
 
8. (C) IN PURSUING ITS ACTIVIST DIPLOMATIC AGENDA, THE 
VATICAN IS SEEKING TO USE THE FULL FORCE OF ITS MORAL 
MEGAPHONE TO ADVANCE ITS VIEW THAT IRAQ\'S THREATS CAN BE 
ADDRESSED SHORT OF WAR.  BLAIR\'S MEETING AND THAT OF AZNAR 
FEBRUARY 27 WILL HELP TO EMPHASIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE 
HOLY SEE SHARES OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE THREAT POSED BY 
SADDAM, WHILE ALSO MAKING CLEAR THE NEED FOR THE UN TO MEET 
ITS RESPONSIBILITIES.  IN THE WAKE OF THIS HIGH-LEVEL 
DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY, WE HAVE NOTED INCREASING CONCERNS BEING 
EXPRESSED ABOUT THE U.S. \"NEGLECTING\" OR \"UNDERVALUING\" THE 
MORAL INFLUENCE OF THE POPE.  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT A 
SENIOR LEVEL MEETING WITH THE HOLY SEE WOULD ALLOW US TO 
OVERCOME THE WIDESPREAD MEDIA IMAGE OF THE U.S. AND HOLY SEE 
AT ODDS OVER IRAQ BY EMPHASIZING OUR SHARED CONCERN OVER 
SADDAM\'S POSSESSION OF WMD, OUR SHARED COMMITMENT TO WORKING 
WITH AND SUPPORTING THE UN, AND OUR SHARED CONCERN FOR THE 
IRAQI PEOPLE.

WITH POLOFF FEBRUARY 25 TO DISCUSS PUK EFFORTS TO GAIN 
VATICAN ATTENTION FOR THE KURDISH CAUSE.  FATTAH TOLD POLOFF 
THAT THE PUK HAD BEEN TRYING TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE HOLY SEE

AND HAD SOUGHT AN AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE FOR \"PM\" SALIH 
DURING IRAQI DPM TAREQ AZIZ\' VISIT TO ITALY.  THE HOLY SEE 
INSTEAD SET UP A MEETING FOR SALIH WITH ARCHBISHOP RENATO 
MARTINO, PRESIDENT OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND 
PEACE, WHERE THE KURDISH DELEGATION RECEIVED THE STANDARD 
HOLY SEE LINE -- THAT IT COULD NEVER BE SEEN TO SUPPORT A 
WAR, EVEN TO LIBERATE THE KURDISH PEOPLE, AND ANY DECISION 
FOR MILITARY ACTION MUST BE TAKEN BY THE UN TO BE LEGITIMATE. 
 FATTAH VOLUNTEERED HIS \"STRONG CONCERN\" AT ANY TURKISH 
EFFORT TO DISARM THE KURDS IN EVENT OF A WAR, AND ASSURED US 
THAT HIS PEOPLE WANTED TO ENTER A POWER SHARING ARRANGEMENT 
IN BAGHDAD.  FATTAH DID NOT FORESEE THE RISE OF INTERCOMMUNAL 
CONFLICT AFTER THE \"LIBERATION OF IRAQ,\" -- INSISTING THAT 
IRAQ DID NOT HAVE A HISTOR OF CIVIL WAR.  WE ENCOURAGED 
FATTAH TO CONTACT TE HOLY SEE MFA COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR THE 
MIDDLE EST MONS. FRANCO COPPOLA, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FRO 
BAGHDAD WITH PAPAL S/E ETCHEGARRAY (REF B), AS  FIRST STEP 
TO GAINING A POSSIBLE PAPAL AUDIENCEFOR SALIH.  WE BELIEVE 
THAT SUCH AN AUDIENCE COUL HIGHLIGHT THE HOLY SEE\'S CONCERN 
FOR HUMANITARIN CONDITIONS IN IRAQ, BUT THAT POPE WOULD NOT 
SE THE PUK WHILE HE STILL HOLDS HOPE TO AVOID WAR.  UCH A 
MEETING COULD, HOWEVER, TAKE PLACE ONCE TH UNSC TAKES A 
DECISION TO ENFORCE UNSCR 1441.  EN SUMMARY.

VISIT TO ITALY. (NOTE: INDICT SEEKS INFORMATION TO PRESS 
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST IRAQI LEADERS GUILTY OF CRIMES 
AGAINST HUMANITY; FORREST, WORKING WITH THE LOCAL PUK OFFICE, 
UNSUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT TO DEVELOP ARREST WARRANTS FOR AZIZ 
DURING HIS ITALY/VATICAN VISITS).  FORREST SUBSEQUENTLY 
ADVISED LOCAL PUK REPRESENTATIVE BAKER FATTAH TO CONTACT 
EMBASSY VATICAN TO SOLICIT ADVICE ON HOW BEST TO PRESS THE 
PUK MESSAGE WITH THE HOLY SEE.  MEETING OVER COFFEE ON 
FEBRUARY 25, FATTAH TOLD POLOFF THAT THE PUK HAD BEEN TRYING 
FOR WEEKS TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE HOLY SEE IN ORDER TO REMIND 
THE HOLY SEE OF THE IRAQI REGIME\'S ATROCIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS 
RECORD AND TO CONVINCE THE POPE NOT MEET TAREQ AZIZ. 
 
3.  (C)  FATTAH AND FORREST FORMALLY REQUESTED AN AUDIENCE 
WITH THE POPE FOR PUK \"FM\" BARHAN SALIH (PH) DURING THE WEEK 
OF FEBRUARY 17, BUT WERE REFERRED INSTEAD TO ARCHBISHOP 
RENATO MARTINO.  MARTINO IS THE FORMER HOLY SEE UN PERMANENT 
OBSERVER, AND RECENTLY TOOK OVER AS PRESIDENT OF THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE -- THE HOLY SEE 
DICASTRY (NOTE: CABINET DEPARTMENT) THAT DEALS WITH JUSTICE, 
PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.  ACCORDING TO FATTAH, MARTINO 
REITERATED THE STANDARD HOLY SEE POSITION THAT IT COULD NEVER 
BE SEEN TO SUPPORT WAR, AND THAT ANY MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ 
WOULD NEED TO BE APPROVED BY THE UN TO BE LEGITIMATE.  FATTAH 
MENTIONED THAT SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY SPIRITUAL LEADER DON 
MATTEO ZUPPI HAD ALSO COUNSELED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO TRY TO 
PERSUADE THE HOLY SEE PUBLICLY TO SUPPORT A WAR, EVEN TO 
LIBERATE IRAQIS SUFFERING FROM SADDAM\'S OPPRESSION.  FATTAH 
SAID HE WAS NOT HOPEFUL THAT THE POPE WOULD EVER MEET WITH 
SALIH.  (NOTE: WE TOO HAD SHARED INTERNET BASED REPORTS OF 
SADDAM\'S ATROCITIES, INCLUDING THE  HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH REPORT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

------------------------------- 
COMMENTARY ON POST-WAR SCENARIO 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) FATTAH TOLD US HE THOUGHT WAR WAS CLOSER THAN EVER. 
HE VOLUNTEERED, HOWEVER, THAT THE KURDS WERE VERY CONCERNED 
THAT THE TURKS WOULD OCCUPY \"KURDISTAN\" TO DISARM KURDS.  IF 
THIS HAPPENED, HE OBSERVED, \"THINGS WOULD GET VERY BAD.\"  HE 
ASSURED US THAT, FAR FROM WANTING INDEPENDENCE, THE KURDS 
WISHED TO ENTER A DEMOCRATIC POWER-SHARING ARRANGEMENT IN 
BAGHDAD.  \"WE ONLY WANT FORTY PERCENT OF THE OIL REVENUES, 
FOR DEVELOPMENT,\" HE NOTED.  FATTAH WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT IRAQ 
COULD AVOID A CIVIL WAR AFTER SADDAM, BECAUSE \"WE HAVE NO 
HISTORY OF CIVIL WAR - JUST OF STRUGGLE AGAINST CORRUPT 
REGIMES.\"

5.  (C) WE TOLD BOTH FORREST AND FATTAH THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S 
PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE IRAQ CRISIS 
IS MOTIVATED BY A VARIETY OF CONCERNS. THESE INCLUDE ITS FEAR 
OF AN IRAQ WAR DESTABILIZING THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST AND 
PERHAPS CATALYZING A GLOBAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND 
ISLAM, ITS STRONG DESIRE NOT TO COMPROMISE ITS ONGOING 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00929  02 OF 02  061607Z 
DIALOGUE WITH MUSLIM LEADERS, AND ITS CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY 
OF CHRISTIAN MINORITIES IN THE MUSLIM WORLD.    HOWEVER, WE 
SUPPORTED FORREST\'S EFFORTS TO HAVE AN MEETING WITH THE HOLY 
SEE TO DISCUSS INDICT\'S WORK, AND REFERRED HIM TO A CONTACT 
IN THE MFA (WITH WHOM HE SUBSEQUENTLY MET).  WE ALSO 
ENCOURAGED FATTAH TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP CONTACTS WITHIN THE 
HOLY SEE.  WE UNDERSCORED WITH FATTAH THAT THE POPE COULD 
NEITHER CANCEL THE AZIZ AUDIENCE NOR MEET WITH SALIH SO LONG 
AS HE WAS HOPING FOR A SUCCESSFUL BAGHDAD VISIT BY HIS 
\"TROUBLESHOOTING CARDINAL\" ROGER ETCHEGARRAY (REF B).  WE 
SUGGESTED TO FATTAH THAT A MORE FRUITFUL AVENUE FOR THE PUK 
TO THE HOLY SEE MIGHT BE VIA THE IRAQI CHALDEAN PATRIARCH -- 
BUT HE WAS NOT OPEN TO THAT, SAYING THE PATRIARCH \"WAS IN THE 
PAY OF SADDAM, JUST LIKE BENJAMIN\" (NOTE: FRANCISCAN FATHER 
BENJAMIN -- A SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE \"SINGING NO-GLOBAL ACTIVIST\" 
WHO ORGANIZES RELIEF WORK IN IRAQ -- SPONSORED AZIZ\'S ITALY 
VISIT).  NOTWITHSTANDING, WE ENCOURAGED FATTAH AT LEAST TO 
SEEK AN APPOINTMENT WITH VATICAN MFA COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR THE 
MIDDLE EAST MONS. FRANCO COPPOLA, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM 
ACCOMPANYING ETCHEGARRAY TO BAGHDAD. 
 
6.  (C)  THE POPE HIMSELF WILL CONTINUE TO AVOID ANY SIGNAL 
THAT THE VATICAN EVEN TACITLY SUPPORTS A WAR OPTION FOR IRAQ, 
INCLUDING BY AVOIDING MEETING WITH SALIH.  THAT IS, UNTIL A 
WAR BREAKS OUT.  AT THAT POINT, THE POPE MAY BE WILLING TO 
MEET WITH THE PUK PM TO UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR HUMANITARIAN 
RELIEF AND TO TRY TO FORESTALL INTERCOMMUNAL VIOLENCE IN 
IRAQ.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  WHILE TAIWAN IS WELL AWARE THAT THE HOLY 
SEE WILL SHIFT ITS DIPLOMATIC  RELATIONS TO BEIJING AS SOON 
AS IT CAN; TAIPEI CONTINUES TO USE ITS LAST EMBASSY IN EUROPE 
TO PRESENT ITSELF AS A MATURE DEMOCRATIC STATE THAT PLAYS A 
CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS IN ALL OF CHINA AND THROUGHOUT ASIA.  DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS BETWEEN TAIWAN AND THE HOLY SEE OFFER UNIQUE 
ADVANTAGES TO EACH.  FOR TAIWAN, RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE 
REPRESENT A PRESTIGIOUS LAST STAND IN EUROPE, ALLOWING 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01033  01 OF 02  150544Z 
CONTACT BETWEEN TAIWANESE DIPLOMATS AND THE 71 OTHER MISSIONS 
TO THE HOLY SEE RESIDENT IN ROME.  TO THE HOLY SEE, THESE 
RELATIONS ARE BOTH A BARGAINING CHIP IN ITS DIALOGUE WITH THE 
PRC AND A MEANS TO SUPPORT THE 300,000 CATHOLICS IN TAIWAN. 
FOR NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PRC AND THE HOLY 
SEE TO TAKE PLACE, THE PRC INSISTS ON THE HOLY SEE BREAKING 
ITS TIES WITH TAIWAN, WHILE THE HOLY SEE INSISTS THAT PRC 
RECOGNIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM EMBEDDED IN THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND THE POPE.  THE TAIWAN 
MISSION TO THE HOLY SEE TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE OF ITS PRESENCE 
IN ROME TO INTERACT WITH THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY, ENGAGE 
BROADER EUROPEAN CIVIL SOCIETY, AND MAKE THE MOST OF ONE OF 
THEIR BEST LISTENING POSTS.   END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------ 
A JEWEL IN TAIWAN\'S DIPLOMATIC CROWN 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  JUST AS THE SITUATION OF THE CHURCH IN CHINA IS 
SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS, SO IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TAIPEI AND 
VATICAN CITY.  THE HOLY SEE IS THE ONLY EUROPEAN STATE THAT 
MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN.  DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS WERE FIRST ESTABLISHED IN 1942, AND THE HOLY SEE 
CONTINUED RELATIONS WITH THE NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT WHEN, IN 
1950, THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS IN BEIJING SEVERED TIES WITH THE 
HOLY SEE AS A PART OF THEIR BROADER EFFORTS TO PURGE CHINA OF 
FOREIGN INFLUENCES.  THE HOLY SEE MAINTAINS ITS DIPLOMATIC 
PRESENCE IN CHINA FROM HONG KONG, NOT TAIPEI, TO SIGNAL THIS 
IS A \"TEMPORARY\" SITUATION THAT AWAITS NORMALIZATION IN ITS 
DIPLOMATIC TIES TO BEIJING.  ASYMMETRICALLY, THE HOLY SEE 
PERMITS TAIPEI TO MAINTAIN A FULL EMBASSY HERE IN ROME.  THUS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01033  01 OF 02  150544Z 
FOR TAIPEI, APART FROM THE STAR-CROSSED ADVENTURE IN 
MACEDONIA, THEIR DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN THE VATICAN 
REPRESENTS A LAST TOEHOLD IN EUROPE. TO THE HOLY SEE, 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN REPRESENT A BARGAINING CHIP 
THAT IT WOULD NOT HESITATE TO USE IN ORDER TO GAIN NORMALIZED 
RELATIONS WITH THE PRC (AND ITS TEN MILLION CATHOLICS).  THE 
HOLY SEE APPEARS CONTENT TO HOLD ON TO THIS CARD WHILE 
ATTEMPTING TO REOPEN DIALOGUE WITH BEIJING.  THE TAIWANESE 
RECOGNIZE THAT PRC INSISTENCE ON SEVERING HOLY SEE/TAIWAN 
TIES BEFORE CHINA/HOLY SEE RELATIONS CAN BE ESTABLISHED IS A 
SWORD OF DAMOCLES HANGING OVER THEM.  ITS THREAD, HOWEVER, 
SHOWS NO SIGNS OF FRAYING JUST YET. 
 
3.  (C)  THE TAIWAN EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE SEEKS TO 
CAPITALIZE ON THIS FULL DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE BY VIGOROUSLY 
WORKING ALL THE CONTACTS AVAILABLE TO IT TO ASSOCIATE TAIWAN 
WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN IMPERATIVES OF HOLY 
SEE FOREIGN POLICY.  AMBASSADOR RAYMOND TAI, A SEASONED 
TAIWAN DIPLOMAT, MISSES NO OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE TAIWAN 
FLAG AT VATICAN-RELATED OFFICIAL AND SOCIAL EVENTS.  TAI HAS 
STATED THAT HE IS \"GREATLY HONORED TO REPRESENT ALL FREEDOM 
AND PEACE-LOVING CHINESE PEOPLE AT THE VATICAN, WHERE THE 
PAPACY IS A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS.\" 
THIS THEME WAS ESTABLISHED WHEN TAI PRESENTED HIS CREDENTIALS 
TO THE POPE.  THE POPE SAID, \"TAIWAN IS FREE!\" TO WHICH TAI 
REPLIED \"LET\'S JOIN HANDS IN MAKING MAINLAND CHINA FREE.\" 
TAIWAN\'S PRESENCE AT THE HOLY SEE ALSO OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES 
TO MONITOR AND INTERACT WITH CLERGY WHO COME AND GO FROM 
WITHIN CHINA AND WHO OFTEN WORK WITH ISOLATED CHINESE 
COMMUNITIES.  THE EUROPEAN BASE FURTHER OFFERS TAI A 
SPRINGBOARD TO SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS EUROPE-WIDE, WHERE HE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

3.  (U)  REFLECTING THE IMPORTANCE IT PLACES ON ITS LAST

4.  (C)  THE TAIWAN EMBASSY IS WELL AWARE OF THE HOLY SEE\'S 
DESIRE TO RE-ESTABLISH NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH THE PRC. 
THEY ARE ALSO AWARE THAT THE HOLY SEE IS READY AND WILLING TO 
CUT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS 
POSSIBLE.  PETER TING TOLD POLOFF THAT THERE IS SPECULATION 
THAT FAIRLY LARGE CHANGES COULD OCCUR WITH THE NEW PRC 
GOVERNMENT, AND THESE COULD BEGIN UNLOCKING THE HOLY 
SEE/BEIJING DIALOGUE ON NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.  WHILE 
TAIWAN LOATH TO LOSE ITS LAST DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN EUROPE, 
IT DOES WANT TO ASSIST IN BRINGING DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
TO CHINA, EVEN AT THE COST OF LOSING THAT MISSION.  AFTER THE 
HOLY SEE TRANSFERS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS TO PRC, TAIWAN WOULD 
LIKELY CONTINUE CULTURAL RELATIONS OUT OF ITS CO-LOCATED 
TRADE OFFICE TO ITALY, MAINLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RELIGIOUS 
DIALOGUE.  WHILE CURRENT PLANNING IS TO MERGE THE CURRENT 
MISSION WITH THE TRADE OFFICE, THE POSSIBILITY OF 
ESTABLISHING A CULTURAL OFFICE TO THE HOLY SEE IS BEING 
CONSIDERED.

5. (C) POST SOMETIMES MUST HOLD OUR TAIWAN FRIENDS AT ARM\'S 
LENGTH BECAUSE OF THEIR DETERMINED ATTEMPTS TO ASSOCIATE 
THEMSELVES WITH THE USG.  AN EXAMPLE IS THEIR INSISTENCE ON 
\"JOINING THE US\" IN SUPPORTING AN ANTI-TRAFFICKING PROJECT 
FUNDED BY PD/ECA.  AMBASSADOR TAI INVITED AMBASSADOR 
NICHOLSON, THEN DCM AND POLOFF TO JOIN THE TAIWAN DELEGATION 
IN PRESENTING A CHECK TO THE CARITAS PROJECT IMPLEMENTERS. 
WE POLITELY DECLINED, SIMPLY REFERRING THEM TO THE CARITAS 
OFFICE.  THAT SAID, THE TAIWANESE, TOGETHER WITH OUR OTHER 
\"ACTION ORIENTED\" COLLEAGUES SUCH AS THE IRISH, CANADIANS AND 
AUSTRIANS, ARE A USEFUL ALLY IN GAINING THE SUPPORT OF 
COLLEAGUES TO ADVANCE ISSUES WITHIN THE STOLID HOLY SEE 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS.  AS NOTED ABOVE, TAIWAN ASSISTANCE WAS 
HELPFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO HOLD A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL 
CONFERENCE ON TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS LAST MAY.  POST WILL 
CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE TAIWANESE ACTIVISM AT THE HOLY SEE 
WITHOUT CROSSING ANY DIPLOMATIC \"RED LINES\" IN OUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. 
 
6.  (C) TAIWAN MOREOVER IS EXTREMELY ACTIVE IN THE \"ASIA 
GROUP\" OF EMBASSIES ACCREDITED TO THE HOLY SEE.  AMBASSADOR 
TAI FACILITATED OUR EMBASSY\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE ASIA 
GROUP\'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN DECEMBER OF 2001.  AMBASSADOR 
NICHOLSON SPOKE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMBATING 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AT THAT MEETING WITH TAI\'S HELP,

SUBJECT: HOLOCAUST MUSEUM DELEGATION WORKS IN SECRET 
ARCHIVES, OFFERS COLLABORATION TO CATALOGUE CLOSED RECORDS 
 
1. SUMMARY: A DELEGATION FROM THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM MET WITH 
VATICAN ARCHIVE/LIBRARY DIRECTOR CARDINAL JORJE MARIA MEJIA 
MARCH 3 AND GAINED ACCESS TO THE VATICAN SECRET ARCHIVE TO 
SURVEY CERTAIN PRE-WAR RECORDS.  THE DELEGATION PROPOSED TO 
MEJIA COLLABORATION WITH THE ARCHIVE\'S SMALL STAFF TO 
CATALOGUE AND MICROFICHE OTHER WWII ERA RECORDS THAT HAVE 
NOT YET BEEN RELEASED.  CARDINAL MEJIA WELCOMED THE 
PROPOSAL, AND URGED THE U.S. DELEGATION TO PUT ITS PROPOSAL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01046  01 OF 02  131459Z 
FOR COLLABORATION IN WRITING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SO THAT 
HE COULD SHARE IT WITH THE VATICAN MFA.  WE BELIEVE THE 
HOLY SEE WILL DECIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OFFER TO 
CATALOGUE, WHICH WOULD ACCELERATE THE RELEASE OF PIUS XI 
ERA DOCUMENTS AND ENHANCE SCHOLARSHIP ON THE VATICAN\'S ROLE 
DURING THE WW II ERA. 
 
2.  AMBASSADOR ACCOMPANIED A DELEGATION FROM THE WASHINGTON 
D.C. HOLOCAUST MUSEUM TO A MARCH 3 DISCUSSION OF ACCESS BY 
HOLOCAUST MUSEUM PERSONNEL TO THE VATICAN SECRET ARCHIVES 
WITH ARCHIVE DIRECTOR CARDINAL JORJE MARIA MEJIA. 
HOLOCAUST MUSEUM SCHOLARSHIP DIRECTOR PAUL SHAPIRO, 
DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM\'S INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES PROJECT, 
RADU IOANID, AND WESTERN EUROPE PROJECT DIRECTOR, KLAUS 
MULLER TOLD MEJIA THAT THE MUSEUM ARCHIVISTS SOUGHT ACCESS 
TO NEWLY OPENED RECORDS FROM THE PRE-WWII PIUS XI ARCHIVE 
(RELATING TO THE BERLIN NUNCIATURE).  THE DELEGATION 
EXPLAINED THAT THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM IS \"A BRANCH OF THE 
U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\" AND HAS A STRONG RECORD OF WORKING 
WITH OTHER OFFICIAL ARCHIVES TO COMPILE A COMPREHENSIVE 
HOLOCAUST-RELATED ARCHIVE AT THE MUSEUM.  MR. SHAPIRO NOTED 
THAT HIS DIVISION WITHIN THE MUSEUM HAS DEVELOPED A STRONG 
RECORD OF BALANCED SCHOLARSHIP ON THE HOLOCAUST.  ALSO IN 
THAT REGARD, MR. IOANU MENTIONED THAT HE AND HIS STAFF HAD 
WORKED FROM OFFICIAL ARCHIVES IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, 
AS WELL AS IN THE U.S. ARCHIVES, TO COMPILE A 
PHOTOCOPY/MICROFICHE RECORD OF HOLOCAUST-ERA DOCUMENTS. 
 
3.  CARDINAL MEJIA RECEIVED THE DELEGATION IN HIS OFFICE 
FOR OVER AN HOUR, AND RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THE U.S. 
PROPOSALS FOR COLLABORATION.  SHAPIRO MENTIONED TO MEJIA 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01046  01 OF 02  131459Z 
THE POSSIBILITY OF OFFERING ASSISTANCE TO VATICAN PERSONNEL 
WORKING TO CATALOGUE UNOPENED ARCHIVES FROM THE PERIOD 
1923-1939.  (NOTE: ARCHIVES FROM THE WAR PERIOD ITSELF WILL 
NOT BEGIN TO BE CATALOGUED IN PREPARATION FOR RELEASE UNTIL 
THE FULL SET FROM THE PIUS XI PONTIFICATE ARE FULLY 
CATALOGUED AND RELEASED -- WHICH WILL TAKE AT LEAST ANOTHER 
YEAR).  CARDINAL MEJIA THOUGHT THE HOLY SEE MIGHT WISH TO 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE U.S. OFFER TO REGISTER AND MICROFICHE 
DOCUMENTS FROM THE PIUS XI PONTIFICATE THAT HAD NOT YET 
BEEN RELEASED. 
 
4.  MEJIA EXPLAINED THAT THE VATICAN HAS RESOURCE 
LIMITATIONS THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CATALOGUE, 
DECLASSIFY AND RELEASE DOCUMENTS AS QUICKLY AS MANY 
GOVERNMENTS CAN.  HE SAID THE VATICAN IS INTERESTED IN 
PUTTING AS MANY DOCUMENTS AS POSSIBLE ON MICROFICHE AND CD- 
ROM, SO THAT SCHOLARS CAN ACCESS THEM.  HE NOTED THAT THE 
VATICAN SECRET ARCHIVE DATES TO THE PONTIFICATE OF INNOCENT 
III (1180 AD).  THE VATICAN\'S PRIORITY IS TO DIGITIZE ITS 
EARLIEST DOCUMENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE THEY ARE 
FRAGILE AND DETERIORATING.  TO DATE, THE VATICAN HAS 
DEVELOPED A THREE CD-ROM SET FOR THE EARLIEST PERIODS (1180 
TO 1504).  WITH ONLY 45 PEOPLE ON THE ENTIRE 
LIBRARY/ARCHIVE PAYROLL, HOWEVER, PROGRESS IN DIGITIZING 
MORE MODERN RECORD WILL BE SLOW IN COMING IN THE ABSENCE OF 
OUTSIDE HELP. 
 
5.  CATALOGUING AND RELEASING FOR STUDY THE MORE RECENT 
PAPER RECORDS ARE, HOWEVER, DEALT WITH SEPARATELY, 
ACCORDING TO MEJIA.  THE VATICAN HAS HIRED TWO ADDITIONAL 
ARCHIVISTS (MAKING FIVE IN TOTAL) TO WORK ON RELEASING 20TH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01046  01 OF 02  131459Z 
CENTURY RECORDS.  THESE ARCHIVISTS HAVE FOCUSED ON 
DECLASSIFYING THE PIUS XI RECORDS (1923-1939) AND, IN AN 
EXCEPTION TO NORMAL PROCESS, HAVE RELEASED THE ENTIRE SET 
OF BERLIN NUNCIATURE DOCUMENTS IN ADVANCE OF THE REST OF 
THE PONTIFICATE\'S RECORDS.  (NOTE: THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM 
DELEGATION LATER RECEIVED ACCESS ID CARDS FOR THE ARCHIVE 
AND WAS ABLE TO BRIEFLY SURVEY THE BERLIN RECORDS). 
 
6.  GIVEN THE INTENSE INTERNATIONAL INTEREST IN SCHOLARSHIP 
ON THE VATICAN\'S ROLE DURING THE HOLOCAUST, MEJIA MADE 
CLEAR HIS INTEREST IN WORKING WITH THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM. 
HE ASKED THE MUSEUM DELEGATION TO PUT ITS PROPOSALS INTO A 
LETTER THAT HE WOULD SHARE WITH THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE 
(WHICH HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR RELATIONS WITH STATES).  HE 
FURTHER URGED THE GROUP TO GET HIM THAT LETTER AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE, SINCE, AT THE AGE OF 81, HE WAS PAST RETIREMENT 
AGE AND SERVING AT THE PLEASURE OF THE POPE AND, HE ADDED, 
OF HIS MAKER.  MR. SHAPIRO TOLD US HE WOULD SEND THAT 
LETTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

7. COMMENT:  WE ANTICIPATE THAT CARDINAL MEJIA WILL FOLLOW 
THROUGH QUICKLY ON THE MUSEUM\'S PROPOSAL, AND WOULD 
ENCOURAGE THE MUSEUM TO SUBMIT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE 
VATICAN HAS BEEN STUNG BY A SERIES OF HIGHLY CRITICAL AND 
ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN \"POORLY RESEARCHED\" BOOKS ON PIUS 
XII\'S ROLE DURING THE HOLOCAUST.  THE RECENT RELEASE OF THE 
FILM \"AMEN\" BY COSTAS GRAVAS, WHICH PURPORTS TO PROVE THAT 
THE CHURCH UNDER PIUS XII TURNED A BIND EYE TO THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01046  02 OF 02  131459Z 
HOLOCAUST HAS ADDED TO THE HOLY SEE\'S SENSITIVITY.  THEY 
WILL THEREFORE WANT TO ENSURE THAT SERIOUS SCHOLARSHIP ON 
THIS PERIOD IS SUPPORTED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO EXPOSE THE 
TRUTH.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY BELIEVE THAT A BALANCED 
READING OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES WILL REVEAL THAT THE CHURCH 
AND MANY CLERGY DID MUCH TO SAVE JEWS DURING THE HOLOCAUST, 
SOMETIMES AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK.

REF: A) STATE 51552 (NOTAL) 
 
1.  PER DEPARTMENT\'S REQUEST (REF A), DCM AND POLOFF REVIEWED 
THE U.S. APPROACH TO ACHIEVING AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION TO 
BAN ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING WITH NEW VATICAN DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER PIETRO PAROLIN.  PAROLIN, WHO WAS FULLY 
CONVERSANT WITH THE STATE OF PLAY ON THE CONVENTION, ASSURED

WITH US TO ACHIEVE A GLOBAL BAN ON ALL FORMS OF HUMAN

CLONING.  DCM EMPHASIZED THE GROWING INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT 
FOR A COMPLETE BAN, AND REITERATED THE FIRM U.S. OPPOSITION 
TO A PARTIAL BAN.  REFLECTING THE BROAD RANGE OF SUPPORT 
AMONG KEY COUNTRIES, PAROLIN EXPRESSED THE HOLY SEE\'S 
WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE APPROACHING KEY UNDECIDED COUNTRIES 
TO BUILD FURTHER SUPPORT PRIOR TO THE FINAL DECISION ON A 
MANDATE FOR THE UN CLONING CONVENTION.  HE AGREED TO DO SO 
BOTH AT THE UN (VIA PERMANENT OBSERVER ARCHBISHOP MIGLIORE) 
AND IN CAPITALS. 
 
2.  RECOGNIZING OUR VIEW OF THE HOLY SEE AS A KEY ALLY IN 
ACHIEVING A COMPLETE BAN, DCM EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF AN 
UNBENDING HOLY SEE POSITION IN FAVOR OF A COMPLETE BAN.  WE 
POINTED OUT THAT ANY SIGNAL OF HOLY SEE FLEXIBILITY TOWARD A 
TWO-STEP APPROACH COULD OFFER WAVERING GOVERNMENTS MORAL 
COVER FOR A POSITION IN FAVOR OF THE FRENCH-GERMAN TWO-STEP 
APPROACH.  WHILE REAFFIRMING SUPPORT FOR A COMPLETE BAN, 
PAROLIN REITERATED THE POSITION,  PREVIOUSLY OUTLINED BY 
ARCHBISHOP MIGLIORE (REF B), THAT IF IT APPEARED THE PUSH FOR 
A COMPLETE BAN WAS LEADING TO NO AGREEMENT AT ALL, THE HOLY 
SEE WOULD SUPPORT A TWO-STEP PROCESS SUCH AS THE 
FRENCH-GERMAN PROPOSAL.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE WOULD REGARD 
THIS AS \"THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS.\" AT THE SAME TIME, HE SAID 
THE HOLY SEE WOULD INSIST ON LOCKING IN THE PRINCIPAL THAT NO 
FORM OF CLONING WAS ACCEPTABLE, AND THAT WORK ON A 
THERAPEUTIC BAN WOULD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW ACHIEVEMENT OF THE 
REPRODUCTIVE BAN.  DCM POINTED OUT THAT LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS 
IN FRANCE AND GERMANY TO BAN CLONING COULD AFFECT THE 
POSITION THESE COUNTRIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY PUT FORWARD. 
PAROLIN DEMONSTRATED CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THESE 
DEVELOPMENTS AND AGREED THAT THEY WERE ENCOURAGING.

3.  COMMENT:  PAROLIN\'S CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATUS OF 
THE CLONING ISSUE AND HIS AFFIRMATION THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S 
GOAL REMAINS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLE 
THAT HUMAN CLONING IN ANY FORM WAS UNACCEPTABLE SUGGEST THAT 
HE WILL BE A STRONG ALLY IN OUR EFFORT TO ACHIEVE AN 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION BANNING ALL FORMS OF CLONING. 
PAROLIN APPEARED PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN OUR TALLY OF 
COUNTRIES MAKING UP THE THREE STREAMS OF THOUGHT ON A 
CONVENTION, AS WELL AS DOMESTIC LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN 
KEY COUNTRIES.  EMBASSY RECOMMENDS THE DEPARTMENT AND USUN 
KEEP THE HOLY SEE UP TO DATE ON SUPPORT FOR THE FULL BAN AND 
ON DOMESTIC POLITICAL SHIFTS IN KEY COUNTRIES SO THEY CAN 
TARGET THEIR ADVOCACY MOST EFFECTIVELY ON COUNTRIES IN LATIN 
AMERICA, AFRICA AND ASIA WHERE THE HOLY SEE CAN BEST BRING 
ITS INFLUENCE TO BEAR.

1. (C) THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION TO THE 59TH UN HUMAN RIGHTS 
COMMISSION CONVEYED TO EMBASSY ITS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH 
US TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF MUTUAL INTEREST, PARTICULARLY 
ECONOMIC AND DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND 
MIGRATION.  HOLY SEE DELEGATE TO THE UNHRC, BISHOP DIARMUID 
MARTIN, SITS ON THE WORKING GROUP ON TRIPS AND PUBLIC HEALTH, 
AND CAN BE EXPECTED TO PRESS THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION THAT 
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES MUST SHOW GREATER SOLIDARITY WITH THE 
POOR.  THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION, THOUGH NON-VOTING, IS WILLING 
TO WORK BEHIND THE SCENES ON COUNTRY RESOLUTIONS, WITH THE 
PROVISO THAT SUCH RESOLUTIONS ARE \"CONSTRUCTIVE.\"  THEY 
SPECIFICALLY OFFERED TO WORK WITH US ON THE BELARUS 
RESOLUTION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
AVOIDING POLARIZATION 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  POLOFF AND POLINTERN MET MARCH 17 WITH THE HOLY 
SEE\'S DIRECTOR FOR UN ISSUES, MSGR. ETTORE BALESTRERO TO 
REVIEW THE U.S. POSITIONS ON KEY UNHRC ISSUES AND SOLICIT 
VATICAN SUPPORT FOR OUR APPROACH.  WHILE NOTING THAT THE HOLY 
SEE DOES NOT VOTE ON THE COMMISSION, BALESTRERO SAID IT TAKES 
THE COMMISSION\'S WORK SERIOUSLY AND WILL ENGAGE ACTIVELY AT 
THE HRC, BOTH BEHIND THE SCENES AND OCCASIONALLY OPENLY WITH 
PARTNERS, TO ADVANCE ITS HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA.  THE HOLY SEE\'S 
GENERAL APPROACH AT THE 59TH UNHRC WOULD BE TO SEEK WHAT THEY 
REGARD AS \"CONSTRUCTIVE\" HRC RESOLUTIONS THAT OFFER COUNTRIES 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO \"GO STRAIGHT\" RATHER THAN SIMPLY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01124  01 OF 02  190648Z 
CONDEMNING AND PUNISHING THEM.  BALESTRERO SAID THEY WOULD 
URGE THE HRC TO BE SENSITIVE TO SIGNALS FROM COUNTRIES TRYING 
TO DEVELOP, YET NOT FULLY IN LINE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS 
STANDARDS.  BALESTRERO STRESSED SEVERAL TIMES THE HOLY SEE\'S 
WISH THAT THE HRC NOT BECOME POLITICIZED -- A DISTINCT 
POSSIBILITY GIVEN THE COUNTRIES NOW SITTING ON THE 
COMMISSION.  HE SPECIFICALLY NOTED THE LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP AS 
POTENTIALLY POLARIZING, AND NEEDING CAREFUL TREATMENT TO 
ENSURE CONSTRUCTIVE OUTCOMES. 
 
-------------------- 
AREAS OF COOPERATION 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  TURNING TO AREAS FOR POTENTIAL U.S.-HOLY SEE 
COOPERATION AT THE HRC, MSGR. BALESTRERO FIRST NOTED THAT THE 
HOLY SEE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE LANGUAGE OF BEIJING  5, AND 
THAT WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO INSERT MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL 
LANGUAGE ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH TO THE DRAFT TEXT.  SECONDLY, 
HE EXPLAINED THE HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE TO MONITOR CLOSELY THE 
RESOLUTION ON AIDS FOR LANGUAGE WHICH MIGHT CREATE PROBLEMS 
FOR BOTH OF US.  READING FROM THE DRAFT AGENDA, BALESTRERO 
LISTED FOUR ADDITIONAL AREAS IN WHICH THE HOLY SEE AND USG 
COULD COOPERATE:  RACISM; GLOBALIZATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS; 
RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE AND MIGRATION.  AS FOR COUNTRY 
RESOLUTIONS, HE OFFERED BELARUS AS ONE COUNTRY WHERE THE HOLY 
SEE DELEGATION WILL TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN NEGOTIATING A 
RESOLUTION.  THOUGH HE ADMITTED THE 2002 BELARUS LAW ON 
RELIGIONS IS NOT SPECIFICALLY A ROMAN CATHOLIC ISSUE, IT DOES 
HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CHURCH IN BELARUS.  MOREOVER, THE 
HOLY SEE IS COMMITTED TO PROMOTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01124  01 OF 02  190648Z 
EVERYWHERE.  PRESSED ON THE CUBA RESOLUTION, BALESTRERO NOTED 
HOLY SEE CONCERNS AT THE LACK OF PROGRESS ON HUMAN AND 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CUBA, BUT DID NOT COMMIT TO ACTIVELY 
WORKING ON THE RESOLUTION.  HE URGED USDEL TO BE IN CONTACT 
WITH THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER, BISHOP DIARMUID 
MARTIN, AND WELCOMED THE OPPORTUNITY OF FURTHER CONSULTATIONS 
AND DISCUSSION OF TEXTS OF RESOLUTIONS DURING THE SESSION.

4.  (C) BALESTRERO SIGNALED TO EMBOFF\'S THE HOLY SEE\'S 
CONTINUING CONCERN THAT THE U.S. WAS BACKING AWAY FROM ITS 
PREVIOUS STRONG SUPPORT OF THE DOHA DECLARATION ON TRIPS AND 
PUBLIC HEALTH.  POLOFF EXPLAINED THE USG VIEW THAT AT DOHA 
AGREEMENTS WERE LIMITED TO CERTAIN COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 
EMERGENCIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, AND THAT A NUMBER OF 
COUNTRIES NOW APPEARED TO WANT TO EXPAND THE DOHA AGREEMENT 
BEYOND THE AGREED FRAMEWORK.  AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY CONVEYED

5. (C)  THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO REGARD THE RIGHT TO 
DEVELOPMENT AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, AND CAN THEREFORE BE 
EXPECTED TO SEEK TO PUSH THE ENVELOP ON THESE ISSUES FURTHER 
THAN WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE.  BALESTRERO OBSERVED THAT THE U.S. 
APPEARS TO THE HOLY SEE AT TIMES AS FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON 
POLITICAL AND CIVIC RIGHTS AT THE EXPENSE OF SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS.  POLOFF REITERATED THE U.S. VIEW 
THAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT COULD ONLY TAKE PLACE IN 
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE POLITICAL RIGHTS WERE GUARANTEED AND 
THERE WAS RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.  FURTHERMORE, POLOFF 
NOTED THAT DEVELOPMENT ISSUES WERE BEST ADDRESSED IN OTHER UN

HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAQ

6. (C) IN A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN 
IRAQ, BALESTRERO CALLED THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THAT

WAS OPEN TO WORKING ON AN EVENTUAL RESOLUTION, WHILE NOTING 
THAT THE SITUATION IS NOW SO FLUID THAT ALL COUNTRIES WILL

7. (C) THE HOLY SEE IS CLEARLY A WILLING PARTNER ON MOST 
ISSUES FACING THE UNHRC.  THOUGH WE DISAGREE WITH THEIR 
DESIRE TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC AND DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS IN THIS 
FORUM, ON OTHER ISSUES BEFORE THE COMMISSION, OUR VIEWS ARE 
CLOSE AND COOPERATION IS POSSIBLE.   BISHOP DIARMUID MARTIN, 
FORMER SECRETARY OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND 
PEACE (AND 1980\'S INTERNATIONAL VISITOR TO THE U.S.), WILL BE 
A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR CORE HOLY SEE VIEWS IN THE 
SOCIAL/ECONOMIC REALM AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY PUSH FOR THOSE 
ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED AND \'CONSTRUCTIVELY\' RESOLVED AT THIS 
YEAR\'S COMMISSION. (THIS CABLE WAS DRAFTED BY POLITICAL

SUBJECT: HOLY SEE RELAYS CONCERNS ABOUT SITUATION IN 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO; SEEKS U.S. SUPPORT 
 
 
1.  (SBU) THE HOLY SEE OUTLINED ITS CONCERNS ABOUT MOUNTING 
UNREST IN THE NORTHEASTERN REGION OF ITURI  IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC) IN A NOTE PASSED TO EMBASSY MARCH 24. 
 THE VATICAN IS CALLING ON THE PARTIES TO \"RESPECT AGREEMENTS 
ALREADY SIGNED AND RESUME NEGOTIATIONS.\"  THE HOLY SEE, WITH 
CLERGY IN COMMUNITIES ON ALL SIDES OF THIS MULTIFACETED 
    CONFLICT, IS CLEARLY CONCERNED THAT RECENT GAINS IN THE CONGO 
PEACE PROCESS ARE AGAIN AT RISK FROM THE MILITARY OCCUPATION 
OF BUNIA BY THE UGANDAN ARMED FORCES.  THEY HAVE ASKED US TO 
BRING THEIR CONCERNS TO THE DEPARTMENT\'S ATTENTION AND WOULD 
APPRECIATE U.S. SUPPORT FOR THEIR POSITION AS OUTLINED IN 
THEIR PRO-MEMORIA NOTE TO ENCOURAGE ADHESION TO THE 
AGREEMENTS AND RESUMPTION OF NEGOTIATIONS. 
 
2.  (SBU)  THE TEXT OF THE NOTE FOLLOWS: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
IN RECENT TIMES, THE ALREADY COMPLICATED SITUATION IN THE 
NORTHEASTERN REGION OF ITURI (DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO) 
HAS INCREASINGLY WORSENED, INCLUDING A MILITARY OCCUPATION OF 
THE CITY OF BUNIA BY THE UGANDAN ARMED FORCES (UPDF) WHO HAVE 
CAUSED THE MILITIA OF THE MOVEMENT UNION DES PATRIOTES 
CONGOLAIS (UPC) TO FLEE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF KIGALI HAS 
PUBLISHED A DECLARATION THREATENING A REPOSITIONING OF 
RWANDAN TROOPS IN CONGO:  \"IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS 
FOUND IT ACCEPTABLE FOR UGANDA TO RETURN TO THE DRC, FOR ALL 
THE DUBIOUS REASONS IT HAS GIVEN, THEN IT IS LEGITIMATE THAT 
RWANDA SHOULD GO IN THE DRC TO CONTAIN THIS NEW SITUATION\" 
(STATEMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND REGIONAL 
COOPERATION, MARCH 14TH, 2003). 
 
IN THIS REGARD, THE HOLY SEE EXPRESSES ITS CONCERN OVER THE 
FORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCES THAT SUCH A POSITION WILL HAVE ON 
THE STRAINED PEACE PROCESS IN THE REGION, AS WELL AS ON THE 
CIVIL POPULATION SUFFERING THE VIOLENCE OF THE VARIOUS ARMED 
GROUPS FIGHTING IN THAT REGION. 

FOR THESE REASONS, THE HOLY SEE ASKS THE INTERESTED PARTIES 
TO AVOID FURTHER SUFFERING OF UNARMED CIVILIANS, TO RESPECT 
THE AGREEMENT FOR THE CEASE-FIRE AND TO WITHDRAW FOREIGN 
TROOPS FROM CONGOLESE TERRITORY, TO RESUME NEGOTIATIONS FOR 
PEACE IN THE AREA AND TO PUT INTO PLACE A TRANSITIONAL 
GOVERNMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
 
THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE HAS ASKED THE APOSTOLIC NUNCIOS IN 
THE INTERESTED COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE PERMANENT OBSERVERS 
TO THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION IN NEW YORK AND GENEVA, TO 
PRESENT THESE CONCERNS TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS.  AT THE SAME 
TIME, IT APPEALS TO THOSE GOVERNMENTS WHICH MAINTAIN CLOSE 
RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES OF THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION, URGING BOTH THEM AND THE MILITIA TO WORK MORE 
DECISIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY TOWARDS A LASTING PEACE. 
 
FROM THE VATICAN, 24 MARCH 2003. 
 
END TEXT 
 
3. (SBU) COMMENT:  BECAUSE THE HOLY SEE HAS CLERGY ON ALL 
SIDES OF THIS CONFLICT, THEY HAVE GENERALLY AVOIDED TAKING 
STANDS ON ANY SIDE OF THE CONFLICT.  THEIR DECISION TO ENGAGE 
AT THIS TIME WITH A NOTE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES AND OTHER 
GOVERNMENTS ENGAGED IN THE PEACE EFFORT REFLECTS THEIR FEAR 
THAT THE PROGRESS ATTAINED TO DATE IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
IS AT RISK OF FALLING APART.  IT ALSO RESPONDS TO A RECENT 
ADMONITION FROM THE POPE, WHO CAUTIONED IN A RECENT AUDIENCE 
THAT, IN THE FACE OF THE FOCUS ON IRAQ, THAT THE WORLD NOT 
NEGLECT THE MANY OTHER WARS AND CONFLICTS THAT THREATENED 
    HUMANITY.

SUBJECT: VATICAN CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION TO 
CONTROL BIOMEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION 
 
 
1.THE VATICAN\'S PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE HAS ISSUED A 
SET OF GUIDELINES FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH TO PROTECT HUMAN 
DIGNITY.  MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMY RECOMMENDED ETHICALLY 
BASED INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION ON BIOMEDICAL TECHNIQUES 
    THAT REFLECTED THE \"VALUES DESCRIBED IN THE NATURE OF THE 
HUMAN PERSON.\"  THE ACADEMY GUIDELINES STRESSED THAT 
EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIOMEDICINE MUST BE CONDUCTED 
WITHIN THE AMBIT OF \"DEFINITE ENDS\" AND ETHICS.  WHILE IN 
PRINCIPLE THERE ARE NO ETHICAL BARRIERS BEYOND WHICH THE 
HUMAN PERSON IS FORBIDDEN TO APPLY HIS \"COGNITIVE ENERGY,\" 
THERE ARE PRECISE ETHICAL LIMITS FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. 
ACCORDING TO THE ACADEMY, \"WHAT IS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE IS 
NOT FOR THAT VERY REASON MORALLY ADMISSIBLE.\"  THE ULTIMATE 
AIM OF EVERY RESEARCH ACTIVITY IN THE BIOMEDICAL FIELD MUST 
BE THE \"INTEGRAL GOOD OF MAN.\" 
 
2.KEY TO VATICAN ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IS THE AVOIDANCE 
OF ANY FORM OF \"INSTRUMENTALIZATION\" OR DESTRUCTION OF THE 
HUMAN BEING.  THE VATICAN ALSO SEEKS TO KEEP BIOMEDICAL 
RESEARCH FREE FROM COMPROMISING LINKS TO POLITICAL AND 
ECONOMIC INTERESTS.  TO MEET THESE GUIDELINES, THE ACADEMY 
HAS PUT FORWARD A THREE-STAGE METHODOLOGY FOR BIOMEDICAL 
RESEARCH THAT RESPECTS THE GOOD OF THE HUMAN PERSON: 1) THE 
PRESENTATION OF THE BIOMEDICAL DATA; 2) EXAMINATION OF THE 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HUMAN PERSON AND DISCERNMENT OF THE 
VALUES THIS RAISES; AND 3) THE ELABORATION OF ETHICAL NORMS 
THAT CAN GUIDE THE WORK OF THOSE INVOLVED IN A GIVEN 
SITUATION. 
 
3.THE ACADEMY ALSO INSISTED UPON A HIGH STANDARD OF 
F 
PROFESSIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND A RIGOROUS PROCEDURAL 
METHODOLOGY CONCERNING THERAPEUTIC AND NON-THERAPEUTIC 
EXPERIMENTATION.  EXPERIMENTATION ON ANIMALS IS ALSO 
ENCOURAGED, TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF HUMAN SUBJECTS.  THE 
    ACADEMY PAPER PICKS UP ON STANDARD VATICAN POLICY ON THE 
PROTECTION OF HUMAN EMBRYOS, DECLARING THAT EXPERIMENTATION 
ON THEM \"IN THE LIGHT OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES\" IS 
ETHICALLY UNACCEPTABLE GIVEN THE HIGH RISK OF IRREVERSIBLE 
DAMAGE OR DEATH.  DESTRUCTION OF EMBRYOS, EVEN IN ORDER TO 
BENEFIT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS, IS JUDGED TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. 
THE ACADEMY FOR LIFE STRESSED THAT \"IT IS NEVER MORALLY 
LICIT TO DO EVIL INTENTIONALLY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ENDS 
THAT ARE GOOD IN THEMSELVES, AND ANY EXPERIMENTATION ON THE 
HUMAN EMBRYO THAT DOES NOT PRODUCE A DIRECT BENEFIT FOR ITS 
OWN HEALTH IS MORALLY ILLICIT. 
 
4.COMMENT: THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE IS THE BODY 
IN THE ROMAN CURIA CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING CATHOLIC 
TEACHING ON LIFE ISSUES.  THE ACADEMY \"STATEMENT,\" 
THEREFORE, REPRESENTS OFFICIAL HOLY SEE POLICY ON 
BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.  ITS DEVELOPMENT AND RELEASE NOW 
REFLECTS THE HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE TO SHAPE AND INFLUENCE 
ONGOING WORK AT THE UN TO ACHIEVE AN INTERNATIONAL 
CONVENTION TO BAN HUMAN CLONING.  THE HOLY SEE OBSERVER 
MISSION TO THE UN WILL CERTAINLY RELY ON AND REFER TO THIS 
NEW \"POSITION PAPER\" AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THAT PROCESS.

1.  (C)  MFA CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONS. GIORGIO LINGUA 
TOLD US MARCH 28 THAT THE HOLY SEE STILL HOPED THAT THE MARCH 
8 OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE SISTERS\' HOUSE IN HAVANA, 
DEVELOPED WITH CASTRO\'S COOPERATION, WOULD HELP PAVE THE WAY 
TO GREATER CHURCH ACCESS TO THE CUBAN PEOPLE.  THE HOLY SEE 
REGRETTED CASTRO\'S TURNING THE OPENING CEREMONY INTO A 
PROPAGANDA OPPORTUNITY, BUT IS WILLING TO GRIT ITS TEETH FOR 
THE TIME BEING.  THE HOLY SEE WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT 
CARDINAL ORTEGA\'S STRONG PASTORAL LETTER OF FEBRUARY 24 AND 
THE CUBAN BISHOPS\' LETTER OF MARCH 11 REACTING AGAINST THE 
CASTRO GOVERNMENT\'S PROPAGANDA USE OF THE BRIGITTINE SISTERS 
(REFTEL).  LINGUA BELIEVED THAT BRIGITTINE MOTHER TEKLA, 
CARDINAL SEPE, AND THE HOLY SEE ITSELF HAD MISPLAYED THE 
BRIGITTINE CONVENT OPENING, NOT JUST BY LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN 
FOR CASTRO TO PROPAGANDIZE, BUT ALSO BY EXERCISING POOR 
COORDINATION AND JUDGMENT IN THEIR PUBLIC ACTIVITIES.  MOTHER 
TEKLA HERSELF TOLD US THAT NO SPECIAL HONORS WERE ACCORDED 
CASTRO AT THE OPENING CEREMONY, AND THAT SHE INVITED HIM TO 
THE INAUGURATION OUT OF \"CHARITY\" AND CHRISTIAN COURTESY, 
GIVEN THAT HE HAD BOTH PERMITTED AND EXPEDITED THE PROJECT. 
NOTING THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED THREATENING LETTERS FROM \"MIAMI 
CUBANS,\" SHE EMPHASIZED HER DESIRE TO STAY OUT OF POLITICS, 
EXPAND THE BRIGITTINE PRESENCE INTO THE POORER PROVINCES, AND 
CONTINUE TO OPEN DOORS TO ANY IN CUBA WHO CARE TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF HER SANCTUARY FOR REFLECTION, PRAYER AND 
RENEWAL.  END SUMMARY.

2. (C) EMBASSY MET WITH MFA CUBAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONS. 
GIORGIO LINGUA MARCH 21, TO GET HIS TAKE ON THE APPARENT 
DIVISIONS BETWEEN CUBAN CARDINAL ORTEGA AND BRIGITTINE MOTHER 
TEKLA, SIGNALED IN THE CUBAN BISHOPS\' LETTER \"CLARIFYING\" 
THAT THE CUBAN CHURCH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH CASTRO\'S 
APPEARANCE AT THE MARCH 8 OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE SISTERS\' 
HOUSE AND CARDINAL ORTEGA\'S EARLIER PASTORAL LETTER 
EMPHASIZING THAT THERE IS NO REAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CUBA 
(REFTEL).  THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE 
HOUSE HAD BEEN REPORTED IN  VATICAN-RELATED PRESS SHORTLY 
AFTER THE BISHOPS ISSUED THEIR MARCH 11 LETTER.  LINGUA TOLD 
US THE HOLY SEE STILL HOPED THE OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE 
SISTERS\' HOUSE IN HAVANA WOULD HELP PAVE THE WAY TO GREATER 
CHURCH ACCESS IN CUBA, THUS THE HOLY SEE WAS WILLING TO GRIT 
ITS TEETH AND ACCEPT CASTRO\'S PROPAGANDIZING OF THE OPENING 
CEREMONY. 
 
3.(C) SEEKING TO DAMPEN THE DIFFERENCES THAT AROSE BETWEEN 
ORTEGA AND BRIGITTINE MOTHER TEKLA OVER CASTRO\'S EFFORTS TO 
CAPITALIZE ON THE CONVENT\'S OPENING, LINGUA INSISTED THAT 
TEKLA AND CARDINAL SEPE, WHO ATTENDED THE OPENING, 
REPRESENTED ONLY THEMSELVES -- NOT THE HOLY SEE.  LINGUA 
UNDERSCORED THAT CARDINAL SEPE, WHO HEADS THE VATICAN 
CONGREGATION FOR EVANGELIZATION, WAS NOT A PAPAL ENVOY SENT 
TO COMMEMORATE THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE\'S CUBA TRIP 
(AS CASTRO REPORTEDLY SAID TO THE TV CAMERAS).  LINGUA AGREED 
THAT CARDINAL ORTEGA AND THE CUBAN CLERGY HAD A LEGITIMATE 
BEEF WITH HOW MOTHER TEKLA HAD ORGANIZED THE CONSTRUCTION AND 
INAUGURATION OF HER CONVENT (I.E. VIA DIRECT COMMUNICATION 
WITH CASTRO AND THE POPE RATHER THAN VIA THE CUBAN BISHOPS). 
HE ADMITTED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD NOT MANAGED THE EVENT WELL,

NOTING THAT MOTHER TEKLA \"IS NOT CONTROLLABLE\" AND THAT 
CARDINAL SEPE HAD TRAVELED TO THE OPENING AND OFFERED REMARKS 
WITHOUT CLEARING EITHER THE TRAVEL OR THE REMARKS WITH THE 
SECRETARIAT OF STATE.  LINGUA ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE

SECRETARIAT\'S CONCERN AT THE ACTIVITIES OF MEXICAN CARDINAL

PARTICULAR SANDOVAL\'S ILL-CONSIDERED PUBLIC VISIT TO AND

PRESIDENT FOX.  AFTER MEXICAN CARDINAL SANDOVAL INTRODUCED 
HER TO CASTRO, A SERIES OF CIRCUMSTANCES LED TO CASTRO 
WRITING TO POPE JOHN PAUL II TO ASK FOR HIS BLESSING ON 
MOTHER TEKLA\'S PLANS TO OPEN A CONVENT IN CUBA, WHICH WAS 
RECEIVED.  WHILE CARDINAL ORTEGA GAVE HIS OWN PERMISSION FOR 
THE ORDER TO ESTABLISH ITS PRESENCE IN HIS DIOCESE, MOTHER 
TEKLA TOLD US THE CARDINAL DID NOT ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE 
PROJECT.  BECAUSE ORTEGA COULD OFFER THE CONVENT ONLY A 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z 
COUNTRY PROPERTY \"MILES OUTSIDE OF HAVANA,\" TEKLA TOLD US SHE 
TURNED TO CASTRO, AND CUBA\'S COMMUNIST PARTY GAVE HER THE 
CONVENT BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN HAVANA.  FIDEL CASTRO PERSONALLY 
INTERVENED TO ENSURE THAT THE BUILDING\'S RENOVATION AND 
INAUGURATION PROCEEDED WITHOUT ANY OF THE NORMAL BUREAUCRATIC 
OBSTACLES, SHE SAID, IN ORDER TO HAVE IT READY FOR THE 
\"ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE\'S VISIT.\"  THE RENOVATION COSTS WERE 
COVERED BY DONATIONS SOLICITED BY MOTHER TEKLA\'S ORDER, AND 
THE VATICAN\'S NUNCIATURE ASSISTED WITH IMPORTING BUILDING 
MATERIALS AND FITTINGS USUALLY HARD TO COME BY IN CUBA. 
 
5. (C) CUBAN CATHOLIC CHURCH OFFICIALS WERE CLEARLY MIFFED AT 
MOTHER TEKLA\'S OUT-OF-CHANNELS APPROACH TO CASTRO AND THE 
POPE, AND ESPECIALLY THE PROPAGANDA OPPORTUNITY IT AFFORDED 
CASTRO, AND DID NOT ATTEND THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY DURING 
WHICH THE CUBAN LEADER FEATURED PROMINENTLY.  MOTHER TEKLA 
STRESSED THAT, CONTRARY TO MEDIA REPORTS, SHE ACCORDED NO 
SPECIAL HONORS TO CASTRO, AND THAT SHE INVITED HIM TO THE 
INAUGURATION OUT OF CHARITY AND \"CHRISTIAN COURTESY,\" GIVEN 
THAT HE HAD EXPEDITED THE PROJECT.  SHE TOLD US SHE GAVE HIM 
ONE OF HER OWN ORDER\'S MEDALS FOR HIS EFFORT \"TO SUPPORT 
ECUMENISM\" ONLY IN RESPONSE TO THE VARELA MEDAL CASTRO HAD 
OFFERED HER.  SHE INSISTED THAT NEITHER GIFT MEANT MUCH MORE 
THAN SIMPLE COURTESY, AND UNDERSCORED THAT THE BRIGITTINE 
MEDAL IS NOT AN OFFICIAL HOLY SEE RECOGNITION. 
 
6. (C) MOTHER TEKLA ASSURED US THAT HER ORDER IS NOT IN CUBA 
FOR POLITICAL REASONS.  IN FACT, SHE SAID THE CHURCH SHOULD 
STAY OUT OF POLITICS AND INSISTED THAT CHRISTIAN CHARITY WAS 
THE SOLE MOTIVE FOR HER ORDER\'S PRESENCE IN CUBA.  SHE SAID 
THE CONVENT SEEKS TO PROMOTE PEACE AND JUSTICE THROUGH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z 
REFLECTION, AND CUBANS HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMING FOR RELIGIOUS 
INSTRUCTION, BAPTISM, AND TO RECEIVE BIBLES.  MOTHER TEKLA 
ALSO NOTED THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAVE ALSO 
CONTACTED THE CONVENT.  THE ORDER HOPES TO OPEN ANOTHER 
CENTER IN CUBA, PREFERABLY IN A POOR AREA OF THE COUNTRY 
OUTSIDE OF HAVANA.  HOWEVER, SHE SAID HAVANA\'S CARDINAL 
ORTEGA HAS HER SISTERS UNDER FIRM CONTROL AND HINTED THAT THE 
CARDINAL MIGHT OBSTRUCT HER ORDER\'S EXPANSION. 
 
7. (C)  MOTHER TEKLA TOLD US THAT PRIOR TO HER VISIT TO CUBA 
SHE HAD RECEIVED \"THREATENING LETTERS\" FROM CUBAN MIGRS IN 
MIAMI WHICH, SHE SAID, WERE AIMED AT DEMORALIZING HER.  SHE 
REGRETTED THE FACT THAT THE PUBLIC CIRCUS SURROUNDING THE 
OPENING OF HER HOUSE HAD CAUSED A RIFT BETWEEN ORTEGA AND HER 
SISTERS, AND BY \"POLITICIZING\" THE EVENT APPARENTLY 
STIMULATED PEOPLE TO SEND THE LETTERS.

COMMENT

8. (C) THE HOLY SEE IS CLEARLY EMBARRASSED AT HOW POORLY THEY 
MANAGED THIS AFFAIR.  NEVER AN INSTITUTION TO MAKE A BOLD 
DIPLOMATIC GESTURE, AS MONS. LINGUA HAS TOLD US MANY TIMES, 
THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE IS NERVOUS ABOUT A POSSIBLE 
CRACKDOWN ON THE LIMITED RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS THE CUBAN CHURCH 
GAINED AFTER THE POPE\'S 1998 VISIT TO THE ISLAND.  HE SAID 
THEY NEVERTHELESS PLACED MUCH HOPE IN THE BRIGITTINE CONVENT 
SETTING A PRECEDENT TO OPEN THE WAY FOR THE MANY OTHER 
PENDING REQUESTS OF RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES TO GAIN ACCESS TO 
CUBA.  WE BELIEVE THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING HERE TOO. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z 
 MOTHER TEKLA IS REPUTED TO HAVE A DIRECT CONNECTION TO POPE 
JOHN PAUL II, WHO HIMSELF IS KNOWN TO MAKE THE OCCASIONAL 
BOLD GESTURE.  CARDINAL SEPE IS A FAVORED SON, WHO WAS 
ELEVATED TO CARDINAL AND MADE PRESIDENT OF THE PONTIFICAL 
CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLE (THE OLDEST AND 
SOME SAY MOST POWERFUL DICASTRY) IN 2001, IN PART FOR HIS 
GOOD WORK ORGANIZING THE 2000 JUBILEE YEAR -- A CHERISHED 
PROJECT OF JOHN PAUL II.  WE FIND IT IMPLAUSIBLE THAT SEPE 
ATTENDED THIS EVENT ONLY AS A \"FRIEND OF MOTHER TEKLA.\"  IT 
SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT THE POPE HIMSELF PUT GREAT STORE IN 
THE OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE CONVENT (WHICH WAS REFLECTED IN 
THE MANY FULL PAGES OF COVERAGE IT RECEIVED IN OSSERVATORE 
ROMANO -- THE VATICAN OFFICIAL NEWS DAILY).  IN THIS CONTEXT, 
WE BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE POPE WISHED TO USE THE 
OPENING OF THE CONVENT TO HELP PRY OPEN THE DOORS TO GREATER 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES IN SUCH AS WAY THAT THE CUBAN CLERGY 
ITSELF WAS PROTECTED FROM ANY BACKLASH. 
 
9.  (C) WE LEAVE TO USINT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE CONVENT 
OPENING WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO GREATER RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN 
CUBA AND WHETHER THE EVENT HAS OR HAS NOT CREATED LASTING

SEE WAS FOLLOWING THE CRACKDOWN WITH CONCERN, AND WOULD 
CLOSELY REVIEW THE U.S. POINTS.  POLOFF FOLLOWED UP MARCH 28 
WITH MFA CUBAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONS. GIORGIO LINGUA, WHO 
STRESSED THAT THE HOLY SEE WAS IN A \"SPECIAL SITUATION\" 
VIS-A-VIS CUBA BECAUSE OF ITS NEED TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH PRESENCE THERE (REF B).  LINGUA POINTED OUT 
THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO UNHRC COUNTRY 
RESOLUTIONS WAS TO STAY AWAY FROM DIRECT ENGAGEMENT. 
CONSEQUENTLY, THE HOLY SEE WOULD NOT ENGAGE ACTIVELY FOR A 
UNHRC RESOLUTION CONDEMNING THE RECENT CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
CRACKDOWN ON POLITICAL DISSIDENTS.  HE ASSURED US, HOWEVER, 
THAT \"IF ANOTHER COUNTRY CAME TO SEEK OUR OPINION, WE WOULD 
CERTAINLY UNDERSCORE THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF CASTRO\'S RECENT 
ACTION.\" 
 
2. (C) REGARDING THE CONTENTS OF A UNHRC RESOLUTION, LINGUA 
URGED THAT ANY SUCH RESOLUTION CONTAIN SOME CONSTRUCTIVE 
COMMENT SUCH AS NOTING THE CASTRO REGIME\'S PERMISSION FOR 
OSVALDO PAYA TO TRAVEL TO EUROPE TO RECEIVE A HUMAN RIGHTS 
AWARD.  AS FOR PUBLICLY CALLING FOR RELEASE OF THE IMPRISONED 
ACTIVISTS, LINGUA SAID THAT HOLY SEE GENERALLY DOES NOT ISSUE 
PUBLIC APPEALS, BUT WOULD WORK QUIETLY AND DIRECTLY WITH 
THOSE INVOLVED TO REMEDY THE SITUATION.  ASKED IF THAT MEANT 
THE HOLY SEE WOULD INSTRUCT ITS NUNCIO IN HAVANA TO ENGAGE, 
HE DEMURRED.  IN THIS REGARD, LINGUA (PROTECT) CONVEYED HIS 
PERSONAL CHAGRIN THAT THE NUNCIO APPEARS TO HAVE \"GIVEN UP ON 
POLITICAL CHANGE UNDER THE CASTRO REGIME.\"  HE ADDED THAT 
CARDINAL ORTEGA\'S RECENT STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE CRACKDOWN 
(AND, WITH A SOP TO THE REGIME, DECRYING OUTSIDE 
INTERFERENCE) WOULD HAVE TO DO FOR NOW. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01406  01 OF 02  021354Z 
3. (C) ACCORDING TO LINGUA, THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THE CUBAN 
CLERGY SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON CHURCH BUSINESS AND AVOID 
ANTAGONIZING THE CASTRO REGIME IN ORDER TO AVERT ANY FURTHER 
REPRESSION ON THE CHURCH.  IN AN EARLY MARCH CONVERSATION, 
LINGUA TOLD POLOFF THAT CARDINAL ORTEGA IS TRYING TO BALANCE 
SUCH \"SOFT PRESSURE\" ON THE GOC FOR GREATER RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM, AGAINST MORE THE OVERT POLITICAL ACTIVISM OF BISHOP 
GONZALEZ OF PINAR DEL RIO.  AT THAT TIME LINGUA FEARED THAT 
THE CASTRO GOVERNMENT MIGHT MOVE AGAINST BISHOP GONZALEZ IF 
HE BECAME TOO \"PROVOCATIVE\" IN HIS SUPPORT OF DISSIDENT 
ACTIVISTS.  LINGUA WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT CARDINAL 
ORTEGA\'S STRONG PASTORAL LETTER DENOUNCING THE CONTINUING 
LACK OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CUBA, AND CHARACTERIZED ORTEGA 
AS \"COURAGEOUS\" AND THE LETTER AS EVIDENCE THAT ORTEGA IS 
\"LOSING TRUST\" IN THE GOC\'S ABILITY TO LOOSEN CONTROLS ON THE 
CHURCH. 
 
4. (C) LINGUA EXHORTED THE U.S. TO BE CAUTIOUS IN HOW IT 
PROMOTES CHANGE IN CUBA, OBSERVING THAT HE WAS SURPRISED THAT 
USINT HAD BECOME SO ENERGETIC IN MEETING WITH DISSIDENTS, 
PROVIDING BOOKS AND SPEAKING PUBLICLY.  HE NOTED THAT PRIOR 
TO THE RECENT CRACKDOWN, THERE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SOME 
IMPROVEMENT IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION, NOTABLY AN 
INCREASING AWARENESS AMONG CUBAN CITIZENS OF THEIR RIGHTS AND 
AN GREATER SENSE OF CIVIC ACTIVISM AMONG SOME -- PARTICULARLY 
AS A RESULT OF THE VARELA PROJECT.  FOR THE CHURCH, HOWEVER, 
HE BELIEVED THE SITUATION HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE COMPARED 
TO LAST YEAR.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE OPENING OF THE 
BRIGITTINE CONVENT (SEPTEL), THE CHURCH HADN\'T MADE ANY 
PROGRESS OBTAINING GOC PERMISSION TO DEEPEN AND EXPAND ITS 
ACTIVITIES.  THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO FEAR THAT THE CHURCH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01406  01 OF 02  021354Z 
IN CUBA REMAINS VULNERABLE TO RETRIBUTION FOR THE POLITICAL 
ACTIVISM OF SOME DISSIDENTS WHO OPENLY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT:  DESPITE THE HOLY SEE\'S COMPLETE REJECTION OF 
THE ONGOING CUBAN ACTIONS, THE HESITATION TO SPEAK OUT 
PUBLICLY REFLECTS THE INNATE CAUTION OF THE HOLY SEE\'S 
SECRETARIAT OF STATE IN TAKING ACTIONS AGAINST REPRESSIVE 
 
SIPDIS 
REGIMES THAT ARE ABLE TO MAKE LIFE DIFFICULT FOR VULNERABLE 
CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES.  WHILE THE VATICAN IS TROUBLED AND 
ANGERED BY CASTRO\'S SUPPRESSION OF DISSIDENTS AND CRITICISM 
OF USINT COM CASON, THEIR REACTION IS TO KEEP THEIR HEADS 
DOWN AND WORK QUIETLY BEHIND THE SCENES.  LINGUA TOLD US 
THERE ARE CUBAN DISSIDENTS WHO \"TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CHURCH 
TO PROMOTE THEIR POLITICS\" SUCH AS DAGOBERTO VALDEZ, AND 
OTHERS, LIKE OSVALDO PAYA, WHO \"ACT AS (GOOD) LAY CATHOLICS.\" 
  LINGUA\'S PREFERENCE FOR QUIET GAINS OVER THE LONG TERM FITS 
WELL WITH AN INSTITUTION THAT FEELS IT HAS MUCH TO LOSE IF IT 
TAKES A FALSE STEP.  EMBASSY WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS U.S. 
CONCERNS ON THE CRACKDOWN, ESPECIALLY WITH FM TAURAN, WHO, AS 
AN OLD CSCE/OSCE HAND, HAS A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
BENEFITS OF A STRONG AND PUBLIC APPROACH TO CALLING FOR

PAGE 02        VATICA  01505  01 OF 02  090534Z 
1.  SINCE THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN IRAQ, POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS 
MADE PERSISTENT APPEALS FOR PEACE IN IRAQ AND EXPRESSED 
CONTINUED CONCERN FOR CIVILIANS AND MEMBERS OF THE ARMED 
FORCES CAUGHT UP IN THE FIGHTING.  HOWEVER, CONTRARY TO MANY 
MEDIA REPORTS, NEITHER THE POPE NOR SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS 
IN A POSITION TO SPEAK AUTHORITATIVELY FOR THE HOLY SEE HAVE 
EXPLICITLY CONDEMNED THE WAR IN IRAQ AS IMMORAL OR ILLEGAL. 
THE POPE AND SENIOR HOLY SEE OFFICIALS WILL CONTINUE TO 
SPEAK OUT IN FAVOR OF PEACE UNTIL THE WAR ENDS, AND WILL 
LIKELY SUPPORT A CENTRAL ROLE FOR THE UN IN THE POST-WAR 
RECONSTRUCTION AND GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ AS A MEANS TO RESTORE 
\"THE RULE OF LAW\" IN INTERNATIONAL LIFE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
OPPOSED TO IRAQ AND WAR AS MEANS OF RESOLVING PROBLEMS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2.  THE VATICAN\'S INITIAL REACTION AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF WAR 
WAS BALANCED, REGRETTING THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO 
COMPLY WITH THE UNSC RESOLUTIONS AND THE ABANDONMENT OF THE 
INSPECTION PROCESS.  AS VATICAN SPOKESMAN NAVARRO-VALLS 
STATED MARCH 20, \"THE HOLY SEE HAS LEARNED WITH DEEP PAIN OF 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LATEST EVENTS IN IRAQ. ON THE ONE 
HAND, IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT DID 
NOT ACCEPT THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE 
APPEAL OF THE POPE HIMSELF, AS BOTH ASKED THAT THE COUNTRY 
DISARM. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS TO BE DEPLORED THAT THE 
PATH OF NEGOTIATIONS, ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW, FOR A 
PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THE IRAQI DRAMA HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED. 
A FEW DAYS LATER, HE ELABORATED THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION 
OBSERVING: \"WHEN WAR, AS IN THESE DAYS IN IRAQ, THREATENS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01505  01 OF 02  090534Z 
THE FATE OF HUMANITY, IT IS EVEN MORE URGENT TO PROCLAIM 
WITH A DETERMINED VOICE, THAT PEACE ALONE IS THE WAY TO 
CONSTRUCT A MORE JUST AND UNITED SOCIETY . . . VIOLENCE AND 
ARMS CAN NEVER RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF MEN.\" 
 
3.  FOR HIS PART, THE POPE HAS FOCUSED MOST OF HIS PUBLIC 
MESSAGES ON PRAYER FOR AN EARLY END TO THE WAR AND CALLS FOR 
ALTERNATIVE MEANS TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE WAR\'S OUTBREAK, 
THE POPE SAID, \"RIGHT NOW WE ARE ALL ASKED TO WORK AND PRAY 
SO THAT WAR DISAPPEARS FROM THE HORIZON OF HUMANITY.\"  MOST 
RECENTLY, ON APRIL 6, HE SAID: \"GOD WILLING, MAY THIS 
CONFLICT END SOON AND OPEN THE WAY TO A NEW ERA OF 
FORGIVENESS, LOVE AND PEACE, \" ADDING, \"MY THOUGHTS TURN, IN 
PARTICULAR, TO IRAQ AND TO ALL WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE WAR 
THAT RAGES THERE.  I THINK ESPECIALLY OF THE UNARMED 
CIVILIAN POPULATION THAT IS SUBJECTED TO A HARSH TEST IN 
VARIOUS CITIES.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
PUSH FOR FORCE OF LAW OVER LAW OF FORCE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  BEYOND THE VATICAN\'S FOCUS ON AN EARLY END TO THE WAR 
AND A CONCERN FOR THE HUMAN SUFFERING, THE VATICAN HAS ALSO 
BEEN ADVOCATING A RENEWED FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF 
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND A RESTORATION OF THE CENTRALITY OF THE 
UNITED NATIONS AS THE MEANS TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL 
CONFLICTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN LOUIS TAURAN 
IN A MARCH 26 INTERVIEW WITH AN ITALIAN CATHOLIC WEEKLY 
ASSERTED: \"IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO RECALL THE IMPORTANCE OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01505  01 OF 02  090534Z 
LETTING THE FORCE OF LAW PREVAIL OVER THE LAW OF FORCE. 
THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT SADDEN ME. FIRST, ABOVE ALL, 
DISRESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW.  WE HAVE A JURIDICAL 
PATRIMONY THAT IS PARTICULARLY COMPLETE AND REFINED.  WE 
HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES AMONG PEOPLES 
IN A PEACEFUL WAY.  I ASK MYSELF IF ALL THE RESOURCES OF 
INTERNATIONAL LAW WERE USED.  THE SECOND THING THAT SADDENS 
ME IS TO SEE THE INABILITY OF MAN TO DRAW LESSONS FROM 
RECENT HISTORY.  TO HAVE WEAKENED THE UNITED NATIONS IS A 
VERY SERIOUS THING. IT IS THE ONLY MEANS WE HAVE FOR 
REGULATED THE LIFE OF NATIONS.  IF WE DO NOT FIND A BETTER 
WAY, THEN WE NEED TO PROTECT THIS MEANS.\" 
 
5.  THE VATICAN\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER AT THE UN, ARCHBISHOP 
CELESTINO MIGLIORE REINFORCED THIS CONCERN APRIL 1 WHEN HE 
STATED AT THE OPENING OF THE COMMITTEE ON DISARMAMENTS 
SESSION IN NEW YORK: \"THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN FINDS ITSELF 
LISTENING TO THE MOUNTING RUMBLE OF ARMS.  WE ARE CONFRONTED 
BY TWO OPPOSING PERSPECTIVES: THE FIRST IS BASED ON THE 
CONVICTION THAT CONFLICTS CAN BE RESOLVED THROUGH A 
DETERMINED AND BROAD-BASED WILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE 
EFFECTIVELY IN LIGHT OF THE WAYS AND WISDOM OF THE LAW; THE

AND RE-EMERGING THREATS, FORCE IS MORE EFFICACIOUS AND 
DIRECT.  HOWEVER, THE LATTER APPEARS TO ONLY REDUCE

IT, INDUCING NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS ON MULTILATERALISM.  A

OF FORCE SHOULD EMERGE FROM THIS SUBSTANTIVE SESSION. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
CONCERN FOR \'CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS\" AND TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6.  THE FINAL CONSISTENT PREOCCUPATION OF THE HOLY SEE IN 
THE AFTERMATH OF HOSTILITIES HAS BEEN TO AVOID PERCEPTIONS 
IN THE MUSLIM WORLD OF A \"CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS\" BETWEEN 
CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM, THE WEST AND THE ARAB WORLD.  THEY 
FEAR THAT SUCH PERCEPTIONS, IN TAURAN\'S WORDS, \"WILL 
GENERATE EVERY EXTREMISM POSSIBLE, INCLUDING THAT OF ISLAM. 
WE ALL NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS.  IT WILL CAUSE TERRORISM. 
AND INFLICT A HUGE WOUND TO THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN 
CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM, BECAUSE, UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE 
ISLAMIC WORLD THERE\'S THE TENDENCY TO IDENTIFY THE WEST WITH 
CHRISTIANITY.\"   NAVARRO-VALLS ADDED HIS QUESTIONING TO 
TAURAN\'S CONCERNS ASKING RHETORICALLY APRIL 2: \"THE INCREASE 
OF THE NUMBER OF DEATH OF BOTH SIDES POSES A GRAVE MORAL 
QUESTION.  WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF DEAD ON 
BOTH SIDES, ALONG WITH THE SUFFERING, DESTRUCTION AND HATE, 
WHEN THERE ARE OTHER PEACEFUL MEANS TO RENDER HARMLESS THE 
THREAT POSED BY IRAQ?\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  ALTHOUGH JOURNALISTS AND COMMENTATORS HAVE ATTRIBUTED 
ALL MANNER OF POSITIONS ON THE WAR IN IRAQ TO THE POPE, THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01505  02 OF 02  090534Z 
HOLY SEE, AND THE VATICAN, THE POPE AND OFFICIALS AUTHORIZED 
TO SPEAK DURING THIS PERIOD HAVE NEVER CONDEMNED THE WAR AS 
IMMORAL.  THOUGH ITS LEGALITY HAS BEEN QUESTIONED PUBLICLY, 
THE POPE HIMSELF HAS NOT SUGGESTED THE WAR IS ILLEGAL. 
INDEED, AS SOME COMMENTATORS HAVE NOTED, THE VATICAN DURING 
THE KOSOVO CAMPAIGN WAS ACTIVELY TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR 
HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION, SO THEY WILL PROBABLY AVOID CLEAR- 
CUT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THE WAR.  IN GENERAL, 
SINCE THE FINAL WEEK BEFORE THE OUTBREAK OF WAR, THE VATICAN 
HAS EXERCISED GREATER DISCIPLINE IN PUTTING OUT ITS MESSAGE 
THAN PRIOR TO THE WAR.  WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF SEMI-OFFICIAL VATICAN SOURCES SUCH AS THE 
VATICAN\'S NEWSPAPER, OSSERVATORE ROMANO AND VATICAN RADIO -- 
WHICH CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN OUTLET FOR STILL STRONG ANTI- 
WAR SENTIMENTS.  AS THE STORY SHIFTS TO HUMANITARIAN RELIEF 
AND INTERNAL REFORM, HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THERE IS 
CONSIDERABLE COMMON GROUND TO BUILD A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE.

1. (U) ROME\'S SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY, A VATICAN-ENDORSED LAY 
CATHOLIC NGO WITH GLOBAL REACH, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY MEDIATED 
AN END TO MOZAMBIQUE\'S CIVIL WAR IN 1991, HAS LAUNCHED AN 
AMBITIOUS PROGRAM TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS IN MOZAMBIQUE. 
SANT\'EGIDIO, WHICH HAS RETAINED ITS COMMITMENT TO 
MOZAMBIQUE\'S DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT, REGARDS HIV/AIDS AS 
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO MOZAMBIQUE\'S FUTURE AND HAS LAUNCHED 
A DRUG RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT AGAINST AIDS (DREAM) PROJECT IN 
MOZAMBIQUE TO PROVIDE HIGHLY ACTIVE ANTI-RETROVIRAL 
TREATMENT TO PREGNANT WOMEN AND LACTATING MOTHERS.  WITH 
ADEQUATE FUNDING, IT INTENDS TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO OTHER 
KEY AT-RISK SECTORS IN THE COUNTRY.  A 12-MONTH CLINICAL 
TRIAL HAS PROVEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, REDUCING TRANSMISSION 
RATES BY UP TO 40 PERCENT AND SAVING THOUSANDS OF NEWBORNS 
FROM HIV INFECTION.  THE DREAM PROJECT HAS ALREADY SECURED 
SUPPORT FROM MULTINATIONAL DRUG COMPANIES, AND MOZAMBIQUE\'S 
MINISTER OF HEALTH, FRANCISCO SOGNANE EXTOLLED THE BENEFITS 
OF THE SANT\'EGIDIO PROJECT FOR MOZAMBIQUE\'S PEOPLE AND 
URGED THAT IT BE ENLARGED TO ENCOMPASS A GREATER NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE INFECTED WITH HIV/AIDS.  ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL 
ALLOW THE PROJECT TO BE EXPANDED THROUGHOUT MOZAMBIQUE, AND 
POTENTIALLY BEYOND. EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT DREAM FITS LIKE A 
GLOVE WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S INTERNATIONAL MOTHER AND CHILD 
HIV PREVENTION INITIATIVE AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, USAID, AND EMBASSY MAPUTO WORK WITH SANT\'EGIDIO TO 
EXPAND THIS PROMISING PROJECT ADMINISTERED BY A GROUP WITH 
A PROVEN TRACK RECORD.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.

SANT\'EGIDIO: AFTER PEACE, TAKES AIM AT HIV/AIDS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (U) THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY, A VATICAN-APPROVED LAY 
MOVEMENT -- NOT LIMITED TO CATHOLICS -- WITH MORE THAN 
40,000 MEMBERS DEDICATED TO CHARITY, HUMANITARIAN, AND 
CONFLICT RESOLUTION EFFORTS IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES, WAS 
INSTRUMENTAL IN MEDIATING AN END TO MOZAMBIQUE\'S 
DEVASTATING CIVIL WAR IN 1991.  THE COMMUNITY\'S COMMITMENT 
TO MOZAMBIQUE HAS NOT ABATED SINCE THEN, AND IT IS NOW 
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ENSURING THAT THE HARD-WON PEACE LEADS 
TO BETTER ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE PEOPLE OF 
MOZAMBIQUE.  TODAY, SANT\'EGIDIO RECOGNIZES THAT THE 
INCREASINGLY HIGH INCIDENCE OF HIV/AIDS IN MOZAMBIQUE IS 
NOW THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE NATION\'S FUTURE, DESTROYING 
FAMILIES AND UNDERMINING ECONOMIC PROGRESS.  AS A RESULT, 
ANDREA RICCARDI, THE KINETIC FOUNDER AND HEAD OF THE 
COMMUNITY HAS DEVELOPED AN INITIATIVE TOGETHER WITH THE 
SIZEABLE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY IN MOZAMBIQUE AIMED AT 
REVERSING THE SPREAD OF HIV/AIDS THROUGH ANTI-RETROVIRAL 
TREATMENTS. 
 
3. (U) ACCORDING TO SANT\'EGIDIO, THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS 
IN AFRICA HAS BEEN BASED PREDOMINANTLY ON PREVENTING MORE 
AFRICANS FROM CONTRACTING THE VIRUS.  SANT\'EGIDIO BELIEVES 
THIS HAS NOT WORKED, EVEN WHILE THEY SUPPORT CONTINUED 
EFFORTS AT EDUCATION AND PREVENTION.  THEY POINT OUT THAT 
NO EPIDEMIC HAS BEEN OVERCOME BY PREVENTION ALONE. 
MOREOVER, THEY BELIEVE THE LACK OF ACCESS TO TREATMENT 
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVENTION, AS 
PEOPLE FEAR BEING TESTED AND FOUND TO BE POSITIVE BECAUSE

4. (U) SANT\'EGIDIO\'S DRUG RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT AGAINST AIDS 
IN MOZAMBIQUE (DREAM) PROJECT IS OFFERING ACCESSIBLE 
TREATMENT TO PEOPLE WITH HIV/AIDS, BEGINNING WITH PREGNANT 
AND LACTATING MOTHERS.  ANTI-RETROVIRAL DRUGS ARE 
ADMINISTERED TO PREGNANT WOMEN TO SAVE BOTH MOTHER AND 
CHILD, THEREBY PREVENTING A MOTHER\'S OTHER CHILDREN FROM 
BECOMING ORPHANS.  CONDUCTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL 
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND VOLUNTEERS, AND WITH EXISTING 
HEALTH DEPARTMENT FACILITIES AND STAFF, DREAM USES HIGHLY 
ACTIVE ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY (HAART) TO PREVENT VERTICAL

B) PREVENTING VERTICAL TRANSMISSION:  DREAM FORESEES THAT 
MOTHERS INFECTED WITH HIV RECEIVE HAART TO PREVENT VERTICAL 
TRANSMISSION.  AFTER GIVING BIRTH THE THERAPY CONTINUES TO 
PREVENT INFECTION BY BREAST-FEEDING. 
 
C) TRAINING:  DREAM WILL BE STAFFED BY MOZAMBICANS, WHICH 
REQUIRES INVESTMENT IN LOCAL AND OVERSEAS TRAINING FOR ALL 
PERSONNEL INVOLVED, A WELL AS A PROGRAM OF SUPERVISION AND 
IN-SERVICE TRAINING. 
 
D) LABORATORY:  TREATING HIV POSITIVE PEOPLE WITH HAART 
DEMANDS ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC SUPPORT AND MONITORING OF ANY 
ADVERSE EFFECTS.  DREAM HAS ALREADY SET UP THE FIRST TWO 
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABS IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY (MAPUTO) 
AND IN THE CENTER AT BEIRA.  A SIMILAR LAB IS PRESENTLY 
BEING EQUIPPED AT NAMPULA IN THE NORTH OF MOZAMBIQUE. 
 
E) INFORMATION NETWORK:  ALL DREAM ACTIVITIES ARE MONITORED 
THROUGH AN IT NETWORK LINKING THE TREATMENT CENTERS AND 
LABS.

FIRST RESULTS PROMISING 
----------------------- 
 
6. (U) THE FIRST RESULTS OF DREAM WERE PRESENTED AT THE 
TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RETROVIRUS AND 
OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS HELD IN BOSTON IN FEBRUARY.  FOUR- 
HUNDRED FORTY HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS, PRIMARILY PREGNANT 
WOMEN, PARTICIPATED IN THE INITIAL DREAM PROGRAM IN ORDER 
TO GAUGE THE EFFECTS OF THERAPY ON MOTHER-FETAL 
TRANSMISSION.  OF THESE, 240 FOLLOWED THE STANDARD THERAPY 
USED IN WESTERN COUNTRIES.  MORTALITY RATES WERE LOWERED; 
THE QUALITY OF THE PATIENTS\' LIFE IMPROVED MARKEDLY, AND 
THE AMOUNT OF THE VIRUS IN THE BLOOD DECREASED NOTICEABLY. 
ABOVE ALL, THE PROGRAM REVEALED A HIGH CONTINUING 
PARTICIPATION RATE -- A POINT OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IN 
A DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE MOZAMBIQUE.  THE RESULTS SHOWED 
THAT EVEN IN NATIONS WITH A BASIC HEALTH SYSTEM IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO USE A THERAPEUTIC MODEL THAT IMPACTS 
SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE RATE OF HIV INFECTION.  THE RESULTS OF 
THE DREAM TRIAL ARE TO BE PUBLISHED IN AN UP-COMING EDITION 
OF THE PRESTIGIOUS BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL LANCET. CLINICAL 
RESULTS OF THE TRIAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET: 
WWW.RETROCONFERENCE.ORG/2003/ABSTRACT/WORDHTM L/2127.HTM 
 
7. (U) THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY FURTHER ELABORATED THESE 
RESULTS AND PRESENTED ITS PROJECT AT A RECENT GATHERING IN 
ROME ATTENDED BY EMBASSY OFFICERS.  IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE 
DREAM PROJECT HAS ALREADY EARNED THE WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT 
OF A VARIED GROUP OF ENTITIES RANGING FROM MULTINATIONAL 
DRUG COMPANIES TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN GERMANY.

INTERNATIONAL MOTHER AND CHILD HIV PREVENTION INITIATIVE 
FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF PREVENTIVE CARE, 
INCLUDING DRUG TREATMENTS, AND BUILDING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY 
SYSTEMS TO REACH AS MANY WOMEN AS POSSIBLE WITH THE CARE 
THEY NEED.  IN FACT, AFTER DCM SHARED THE PRESIDENT\'S 
JANUARY ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS NEW HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE WITH 
SANT\'EGIDIO, ONE OF ITS SENIOR OFFICIALS SAID HE FELT AS IF 
THE PRESIDENT WAS READING FROM THEIR PROPOSAL BECAUSE OF 
THE COMMON FOCUS ON ANTI-RETROVIRAL DRUGS, MOZAMBIQUE, 
PREVENTING MOTH-CHILD TRANSMISSION, AND PRESERVING FAMILY 
UNITS.  THE PRESIDENT\'S ANNOUNCEMENT STATED THAT THE

9. (U) EMBASSY BELIEVES IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND A FAITH- 
BASED INITIATIVE WITH BETTER PROSPECTS THAN THE SANT\'EGIDIO 
DREAM PROJECT.  WE NOTE THAT THE COMMUNITY OF SANT\'EGIDIO, 
FOUNDED IN ROME IN 1968, IS VATICAN-ENDORSED CATHOLIC LAY 
MOVEMENT WITH MORE THAN 40,000 MEMBERS (NOT ALL CATHOLIC) 
DEDICATED TO CHARITY AND HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN MORE THAN 
60 COUNTRIES.  THE COMMUNITIES ARE COMMITTED TO SOLIDARITY 
WITH THE POOR AND SUFFERING INCLUDING PHYSICALLY AND 
MENTALLY DISABLED, HOMELESS, FOREIGN IMMIGRANTS, PEOPLE 
WITH HIV/AIDS, TERMINALLY ILL PEOPLE, PRISONERS, ELDERLY, 
ROMA AND SINTI, AND REFUGEES.  IT IS ALSO A LEADING FORCE 
FOR ECUMENICAL DIALOGUE AS A WAY TO PROMOTE PEACE AND CO- 
OPERATION AMONG RELIGIONS, AND TO RESOLVE ARMED CONFLICTS. 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO RESOLVING THE 
CONFLICTS IN MOZAMBIQUE AND GUATEMALA, AND HAVE HELPED 
MEDIATE PEACE EFFORTS IN AFRICA\'S GREAT LAKES REGION AND 
KOSOVO.  EMBASSY VATICAN HAS PREVIOUSLY FUNDED A 
SANT\'EGIDIO PROJECT IN KOSOVO THAT SEEKS TO RECONCILE SERBS 
AND ETHNIC ALBANIANS AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL.  WE 
MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH SANT\'EGIDIO ON A BROAD 
RANGE OF AFRICAN ISSUES, AND THEY CONSULT REGULARLY WITH 
SENIOR USG OFFICIALS.

THROUGH THE PROGRAM, WE BELIEVE THIS OFFERS AN IDEAL 
PROGRAM FOR FUTURE USG FUNDING.  SANT\'EGIDIO HAS TOLD US 
THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY CHARTED AN AMBITIOUS EXPANSION OF 
THE PROGRAM, WHICH IS LIMITED ONLY BY THE LEVEL OF FUNDING. 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH WASHINGTON AGENCIES AND 
EMBASSY MAPUTO TO HELP FUND THIS PROMISING PROJECT, WHICH 
CAN SAVE THOUSANDS OF NEWBORNS FROM HIV INFECTION, KEEP 
FAMILIES INTACT, AND REDUCE POVERTY.

SUMMARY

1. (C) HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN, CARDINAL STAFFORD, 
THE AMERICAN HEADS OF THE COUNCIL FOR LAITY, AND ITALIAN 
CARDINAL RUINI, WHO IS THE VICAR OF ROME AND HEAD OF THE 
ITALIAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE, TOLD UNDER SECRETARY BOLTON APRIL 
9 THAT THEY ARE LOOKING TO IRAQ\'S FUTURE AND ARE FOCUSED ON 
HUMANITARIAN RELIEF AND A BETTER FUTURE FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE. 
 THEY CONVEYED THEIR \"RESPECT\" FOR THE DIFFICULT DECISION THE 
PRESIDENT HAD MADE, AND THEIR APPRECIATION FOR U.S. EFFORTS 
TO AVOID CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.  TAURAN OFFERED THE ACTIVE 
COOPERATION OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN IRAQ TO FACILITATE FOOD 
AND MEDICINE DISTRIBUTION AND PREVENT LOCAL MAFIAS FROM 
PROFITING ON SUCH DISTRIBUTION, AND BOLTON ACCEPTED HIS 
OFFER.  TAURAN AND OTHERS URGED THAT THE UN BE GIVEN AN 
IMPORTANT ROLE IN IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION, AND CALLED ON THE 
U.S. TO INVOLVE AS MANY COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE IN THE PROCESS 
OF REBUILDING IRAQ AND IN DEALING WITH CONTINUING WMD THREATS 
FROM NORTH KOREA, IRAN AND SYRIA.  TAURAN WELCOMED BOLTON\'S 
AFFIRMATION OF THE U.S. DESIRE TO INTENSIFY OUR EFFORTS TO 
OVERCOME THE CURRENT ARAB-ISRAELI IMPASSE.  RUINI EXPRESSED 
HIS CONFIDENCE THAT SCENES OF JUBILANT IRAQI\'S WOULD 
DRAMATICALLY SHIFT EUROPEAN OPINION ABOUT THE WAR. \"IF THE 
FUTURE GOES WELL,\" HE SAID, \"THE PAST WILL LOSE ITS 
IMPORTANCE.\"  END SUMMARY.

2. (C) IN MEETINGS APRIL 9 WITH HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINISTER 
JEAN LOUIS TAURAN, VICAR OF ROME AND HEAD OF THE ITALIAN 
CONFERENCE OF BISHOPS CARDINAL CAMILLO RUINI, AND SENIOR 
AMERICAN CARDINAL JAMES FRANCIS STAFFORD, UNDER SECRETARY 
BOLTON EMPHASIZED THE PRESIDENT\'S DESIRE TO CONTINUE A CLOSE 
DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE ON IRAQ AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO 
ADDRESS HUMANITARIAN PRIORITIES AND BUILD A PEACEFUL, 
DEMOCRATIC FUTURE FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  TAURAN AND HIS 
COLLEAGUES MADE CLEAR THAT THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED IN 
CONTINUING A DEBATE ON THE MERITS OF WAR, BUT WERE LOOKING 
AHEAD AT HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND IRAQ\'S FUTURE.  \"THE DECISION 
WAS TAKEN.  THAT\'S DONE, AND WE RESPECT THE DECISION THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN,\" TAURAN SAID.  RUINI LIKEWISE RECOGNIZED 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD WEIGHED THE DECISION CAREFULLY AND 
THAT IT WAS CLEAR THE UNITED STATES WAS DOING EVERYTHING 
POSSIBLE TO PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THE CONDUCT OF THE 
WAR. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
OFFER TO FACILITATE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) IN LIGHT OF THE HOLY SEE\'S PREOCCUPATION WITH THE 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION, TAURAN TOLD UNDER SECRETARY BOLTON 
THAT THE CHALDEAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN IRAQ HAD AN EFFECTIVE, 
WELL-ORGANIZED NETWORK IN KEY IRAQI CITIES THAT WOULD BE ABLE 
TO FACILITATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOODS AND MEDICINES.  THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01570  01 OF 03  131013Z 
APOSTOLIC NUNCIO IN BAGHDAD, MONSIGNOR FERNANDO FILONI, HAD 
REPORTED TO TAURAN THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF NEUTRAL POINTS OF 
DISTRIBUTION, LOCAL MAFIAS WERE SPRINGING UP, TAKING THE 
GOODS, AND PROFITEERING.  ACCORDING TO THE NUNCIO, THE LOCAL 
CHURCHES WERE WILLING TO HELP AVERT THIS.  TAURAN SAID HE HAS 
ASKED THE LOCAL BISHOPS TO MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO MEET 
WITH U.S. FORCES AND HUMANITARIAN AID PROVIDERS, AND PROVIDED 
NAMES OF BISHOPS IN KEY CITIES (REF A).  U/S BOLTON ACCEPTED 
TAURAN\'S OFFER AND PROMISED TO PASS ALONG THE NAMES TO THE 
DEPARTMENT\'S POLITICAL-MILITARY ACTION TEAM.  TAURAN SAID HE 
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SITUATION IN THE HOSPITALS WAS THE MOST 
DRAMATIC AND IN NEED OF SUPPORT.

UN ROLE

4. (C) THE HOLY SEE HAS PUBLICLY SUPPORTED A PROMINENT ROLE 
FOR THE UN IN IRAQI RELIEF AND RECONSTRUCTION, AND CARDINALS 
RUINI AND STAFFORD ADVOCATED THAT THE U.S. SEEK TO INVOLVE AS 
MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE IN THIS PROCESS.  RUINI

PRACTICAL ISSUES, SOME OF THE RECENT TENSIONS WOULD QUICKLY

DISSIPATE.  BOLTON RESPONDED THAT THE UN WOULD, AS THE 
PRESIDENT HAD STATED, PLAY A VITAL ROLE.  HOWEVER, IT WAS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01570  02 OF 03  131014Z 
IMPORTANT NOT TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN THEOLOGICAL DEBATES ABOUT 
THE NATURE OF THIS ROLE.  THE ISSUE AT HAND WAS NOT WHETHER 
THE U.S. OR UN WOULD CONTROL IRAQ, BUT HOW SOON CONTROL COULD 
BE TURNED OVER TO A LEGITIMATE IRAQI AUTHORITY.  IN THE 
MEANTIME, IT WAS VITAL TO CONCENTRATE ON RESOLVING PRACTICAL 
ISSUES TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  IN THIS, THE 
UN WOULD PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE, BOLTON ASSURED HIS 
INTERLOCUTORS.  TAURAN CONCURRED THAT THIS WAS VITAL, AND 
OBSERVED THAT THE IRAQI PEOPLE WERE \"INTELLECTUALLY 
WELL-EQUIPPED,\" WHICH WOULD FACILITATE AN EARLY TRANSITION TO 
IRAQI AUTHORITY.  TO REINFORCE THIS POINT HE QUOTED AN ARAB 
APHORISM THAT \"BOOKS WERE WRITTEN IN CAIRO, PRINTED IN 
LEBANON, AND READ IN BAGHDAD.\"  BOLTON AFFIRMED THAT THE U.S. 
HAD NO DESIRE FOR A LONG OCCUPATION.  OUR GOALS, HE ADDED, 
WERE TO FIND AND DESTROY WMD, PRESERVE EXTERNAL SECURITY IN 
THE SHORT-TERM, AND TURN AUTHORITY OVER TO LEGITIMATE, 
DEMOCRATIC IRAQI AUTHORITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  RUINI ALSO 
WELCOMED THIS COMMITMENT, OBSERVING \"IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO 
TURN AUTHORITY OVER TO IRAQI\'S IN A SHORT TIME, THAT WOULD BE 
IDEAL.\" 
 
---------------------- 
THE BROADER WMD THREAT 
---------------------- 
 
5. (C) WITH ALL OF HIS VATICAN INTERLOCUTORS, BOLTON REVIEWED 
THE BROADER WMD THREAT, STRESSING THAT WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION ARE NOT MILITARY WEAPONS, AND CAN ONLY BE USED TO 
KILL CIVILIANS, AS SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD WITH HIS OWN PEOPLE. 
ALL VATICAN INTERLOCUTORS EXPRESSED CONCERN WITH WHAT HAPPENS 
NEXT, NOTING FEARS THAT THE WAR ON IRAQ COULD BE FOLLOWED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01570  02 OF 03  131014Z 
WITH OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST IRAN, SYRIA, OR NORTH KOREA. 
BOLTON MADE CLEAR THAT IRAQ WAS NOT A MODEL FOR NORTH KOREA, 
IRAN OR SYRIA, AND THAT THERE IS NO \'COOKIE CUTTER\' APPROACH 
TO RESOLVING THESE ISSUES.  HE POINTED OUT THAT WE WERE 
ACTIVELY PURSUING DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES IN ALL OF THESE 
CASES, AND THAT WE HOPED THESE COUNTRIES WOULD DRAW THE RIGHT 
LESSON FROM THE IRAQ EXAMPLE:  THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH IT FOR 
THEM TO CONTINUE PURSUING WMD.  ALL THREE VATICAN OFFICIALS 
EXPRESSED THEIR BELIEF THAT THE U.S. SHOULD SEEK TO WORK WITH 
OTHER COUNTRIES IN A MULTILATERAL EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THESE 
THREATS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. 
 
6.  (C) TURNING TO SPECIFIC COUNTRIES, TAURAN FOCUSED FIRST 
ON NORTH KOREA, ABOUT WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE HOLY SEE HAD 
LIMITED UNDERSTANDING.  BOLTON REVIEWED THE BACKGROUND TO THE 
DISCOVERY OF THE NORTH KOREAN PROGRAM AND OUR EFFORTS TO 
PERSUADE NORTH KOREA TO ABANDON ITS PROGRAM.  HE EMPHASIZED 
THAT WE WERE ACTIVELY TRYING TO ENGAGE CHINA AND RUSSIA TO 
BECOME MORE INVOLVED, WHILE WORKING WITH JAPAN AND SOUTH 
KOREA.  HE POINTED OUT THE HIGH STAKES INVOLVED, GIVEN 
SUPPORT IN JAPAN FOR A NUCLEAR PROGRAM TO COUNTER A NORTH 
KOREAN THREAT AND THE SUBSEQUENT POTENTIAL FOR AN ASIAN ARMS 
RACE BETWEEN JAPAN AND CHINA. 
 
7.  (C) ON IRAN, BOLTON OUTLINED LONG-STANDING CONCERNS THAT 
IRAN WAS PURSUING A COMPLETE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM THAT WOULD 
GIVE THE IRANIANS THE CAPACITY TO MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  HE 
REVIEWED OUR EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE RUSSIA TO CUT OFF 
ASSISTANCE, AND THE FINDINGS FROM THE RECENT VISIT OF THE 
IAEA INSPECTORS, WHICH SURPRISED MANY IN THE IAEA.  TAURAN 
ASKED WHETHER WE FOUND RUSSIA TO BE A RELIABLE INTERLOCUTOR, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01570  02 OF 03  131014Z 
NOTING THAT THE HOLY SEE FOUND THEY HAD GOOD RESULTS FROM TOP 
RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP, BUT THAT THERE WAS NO FOLLOW THROUGH FROM 
OTHER PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.  TAURAN ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT 
THE HOLY SEE REGARDED IRAN AS \"A KEY COUNTRY\" IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST AND URGED THAT WE SUPPORT ANY SIGNS OF A \"DEMOCRATIC 
OPENING.\"  BOLTON SAID WE REMAINED DEEPLY CONCERNED BY RECENT 
SYRIAN ACTIONS AS WELL AS SYRIA\'S CONTINUED PURSUIT OF WMD. 
TAURAN SAID HE BELIEVED THE BRITISH COULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT 
ROLE WITH SYRIA, WHILE BOLTON NOTED THAT THE FRENCH COULD 
ALSO BE CONSTRUCTIVE. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
REINVIGORATING MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) BOLTON ASSURED TAURAN AND THE OTHER OFFICIALS THAT THE 
U.S. WAS COMMITTED TO REINVIGORATING OUR EFFORTS TO RESOLVE 
THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CRISIS ONCE THE IRAQ CRISIS WAS 
BEHIND US.  HE ADDED THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD DEEPEN HIS 
ALREADY CONSIDERABLE INVOLVEMENT ONCE THE NEW PALESTINIAN 
PRIME MINISTER WAS IN PLACE AND HAD AUTHORITY TO ACT 
EFFECTIVELY.  TAURAN WELCOMED THIS COMMITMENT, COMMENTING 
THAT THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN DISPUTE WAS \"THE MOTHER OF ALL

AVOIDING A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) BOTH CARDINALS SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF 
AVOIDING PERCEPTIONS OF A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS BETWEEN THE 
MUSLIM WORLD AND THE WEST -- A RECENT PREOCCUPATION OF THE 
HOLY SEE (SEPTEL).  CARDINAL STAFFORD RECOUNTED AN EXPERIENCE 
CHAIRING A MEETING IN LEBANON WHERE HE WAS SHARPLY CRITICIZED 
BECAUSE OF HIS AMERICAN NATIONALITY, AND SAID THE DEPTH OF 
HOSTILITY TOWARD THE UNITED STATES WAS DEEPLY TROUBLING TO 
HIM.  WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT CRITICISM CAME WITH THE 
TERRITORY OF BEING THE ONLY SUPERPOWER, HE ALSO BELIEVED THAT 
THE U.S. NEEDED TO ACT WITH HUMILITY AND DO A BETTER JOB OF 
DEMONSTRATING OUR CONCERN FOR THE PRIORITIES OF OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
 
--------------------------------- 
OVERCOMING TRANSATLANTIC TENSIONS 
--------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) CARDINAL RUINI, ONE OF THE POPE\'S CLOSEST 
COLLABORATORS AND SOMEONE CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR TO 
JOHN PAUL II, EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN FOR THE WEAKENING OF NATO 
AND THE UN AS A RESULT OF THE IRAQ CRISIS, AND URGED THAT WE 
ENSURE BOTH INSTITUTIONS ARE REPAIRED.  AS PRESIDENT OF THE 
ITALIAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE, RUINI IS PLUGGED INTO THE 
DOMESTIC ITALIAN POLITICAL SCENE, AND CITED HIS CONCERN THAT 
ITALY -- WHICH USED TO BE PRO-U.S. -- WAS LOSING THIS 
ORIENTATION.  HE CITED A SIMILAR WORRYING TREND IN GERMANY. 
HE NOTED A DISTRUST OF FRANCE, WHICH HE NOTED HARBORED GLOBAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01570  03 OF 03  131014Z 
AMBITIONS THAT WERE ALIEN TO ITALY AND GERMANY AFTER WWII. 
ALTHOUGH MOST ITALIANS REMAINED WARY OF THE FRENCH, RUINI 
WORRIED THAT THE FRENCH APPROACH COULD BECOME DOMINANT IN 
EUROPE UNLESS CURRENT DIVISIONS WERE REPAIRED.  THE KEY TO 
DOING SO, ACCORDING TO RUINI, WAS TO \"MAKE CLEAR THE U.S WAS 
FOR PEACE.\"  IN THIS REGARD, HE OBSERVED THAT IMAGES OF 
IRAQIS WARMLY WELCOMING AMERICAN TROOPS IN THE DAYS AHEAD 
WOULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON EUROPEAN PUBLIC OPINION.  \"IF THE 
FUTURE GOES WELL,\" HE CONCLUDED, \"THE PAST WILL LOSE ITS 
IMPORTANCE.\"  BOLTON ASSURED RUINI THAT THE WORLD WOULD SEE 
THAT THE U.S. MOTIVES WERE EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD SAID THEY WERE 
-- ELIMINATE THE WMD THREAT, END A BRUTAL DICTATORSHIP, AND 
GIVE THE IRAQI PEOPLE A CHANCE FOR A BETTER LIFE.

11. (C) COMING ON THE MORNING OF THE COLLAPSE OF BAGHDAD,

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U)  A VIGOROUS POPE JOHN PAUL II PRESIDED OVER THE 
VATICAN\'S EASTER WEEK SERVICES, USING HIS HOMILIES AND 
EASTER MESSAGE TO FOCUS GLOBAL ATTENTION ON THE HOLY SEE\'S 
TOP INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS:  RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ, PEACE 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM AND RELIGIOUS 
VIOLENCE, AND THE NEED TO AVOID A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS. 
THE POPE ALSO CAUTIONED AGAINST NEGLECTING LESS PROMINENT 
CONFLICTS IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA.  HIS MESSAGES 
REINFORCE THE VATICAN\'S FORWARD-LOOKING AGENDA IN THE WAKE 
OF THE IRAQ WAR, AND ITS DESIRE TO REFOCUS INTERNATIONAL 
ATTENTION ON ITS BROADER AGENDA AFTER MONTHS OF INTENSE 
FOCUS ON IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------- 
REBUILDING IRAQ FOR IRAQIS 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) IN HIS EASTER MESSAGE \"TO THE CITY AND THE WORLD\", 
THE POPE EVOKED CHEERS FROM THE THOUSANDS IN ST. PETER\'S 
SQUARE WITH HIS DECLARATORY STATEMENT: \"PEACE IN IRAQ.\"  HE 
URGED THAT THE IRAQI PEOPLE, \"WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,\" SHOULD BECOME \"THE PROTAGONISTS 
OF THE COLLECTIVE REBUILDING OF THEIR COUNTRY.\"  THE FUTURE 
OF IRAQ WAS ALSO AT THE CENTER OF THE GOOD FRIDAY HOMILY -- 
TRADITIONALLY PREACHED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE POPE BY A 
PAPAL HOUSEHOLD PREACHER.  THIS YEAR\'S PREACHER, CAPUCHIN 
FATHER RANIERO CANTALAMESSA, WHILE NEVER MENTIONING IRAQ OR 
THE UNITED STATES BY NAME, QUOTED JOHN LENNON, JEAN-PAUL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01694  01 OF 02  221342Z 
SARTRE AND ST. AUGUSTINE, AND ASSERTED THAT \"EVERY NATION 
HAS THE RIGHT TO GOVERN ITSELF.\"  CANTALAMESSA STRESSED THE 
DIFFICULTY OF IDENTIFYING THE ENEMY \"WHERE TERRORISM IS 
CONCERNED.\"  HE ALSO OBSERVED THAT SOMEONE ONCE CRITICIZED 
ABRAHAM LINCOLN FOR BEING TOO COURTEOUS TO HIS ENEMIES AND 
TOLD LINCOLN THAT HIS JOB AS PRESIDENT WAS TO DESTROY THEM. 
LINCOLN ANSWERED, \"DO I NOT DESTROY MY ENEMIES WHEN I MAKE 
THEM MY FRIENDS?\"  THE PAPAL PREACHER THEN ASKED: \"WILL 
THAT GREAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FIND SOMEONE TO 
TAKE UP THE TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE?\" 
 
--------------------------- 
REFOCUSING ON GLOBAL AGENDA 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) THE POPE\'S EASTER MESSAGE ALSO SOUGHT TO REFOCUS 
ATTENTION TO THE \"FORGOTTEN WARS AND PROTRACTED 
HOSTILITIES\" BRINGING SUFFERING, DEATH AND DESTRUCTION IN 
VARIOUS PARTS OF AFRICA, ASIA, LATIN AMERICA AND THE 
CAUCASUS REGION OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION \"AMID SILENCE 
AND NEGLECT ON THE PART OF CONSIDERABLE SECTORS OF PUBLIC 
OPINION.\"  RETURNING TO ONE OF THE VATICAN\'S GREATEST 
PREOCCUPATIONS, THE PONTIFF DECLARED THAT VIOLENCE AND 
BLOODSHED IN THE HOLY LAND \"WITH NO SIGN OF CEASING\" WERE 
CAUSING HIM \"PROFOUND GRIEF.\" 
 
4.  (U) THE POPE REITERATED HIS CONSISTENT REJECTION OF 
TERRORISM \"WHICH THREATENS THE ORDERLY DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
HUMAN FAMILY\" AND URGED FOLLOWERS OF ALL RELIGIONS TO 
PROMOTE DIALOGUE AND UNDERSTANDING AND TO WORK TOGETHER FOR 
A \"NEW ERA OF JUSTICE AND PEACE.\"   HE ALSO PRAYED FOR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01694  01 OF 02  221342Z 
DELIVERANCE FROM \"THE PERIL OF A TRAGIC CLASH BETWEEN 
CULTURES AND RELIGIONS.\"  PRAYERS WERE OFFERED FOR ALL 
SOLDIERS THAT \"THEY WOULD NOURISH IN THE MINDS AND HEARTS 
THOUGHTS OF PEACE AND NOT VENGEANCE\" AND THAT THEY WORK FOR 
\"RECONSTRUCTION AND LIFE.\" 
 
5.  (U) THE VATICAN\'S BROAD INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS ALSO 
FOUND AN ECHO IN THE SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE GOOD 
FRIDAY STATIONS OF THE CROSS CEREMONY AT ROME\'S COLISEUM. 
THOSE CARRYING THE CROSS IN PROCESSION AROUND THE COLISEUM 
INCLUDED A WOMAN FROM COLOMBIA, MEN FROM SIERRA LEONE AND 
LIBERIA, FRANCISCAN FRIARS FROM THE HOLY LAND, AND AN 
ENGAGED COUPLE AND A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER WHO HAD FLED 
IRAQ BEFORE THE WAR BEGAN.  INTRODUCING THE SERVICE, THE 
POPE IMPLORED GOD\'S ATTENTION TO \"THE BLOOD SHED BY THE 
MANY VICTIMS OF HATRED, WAR AND TERRORISM.\"

CONFLICT 
 
REF: VATICAN 01329 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) DURING HIS WEEKLY WEDNESDAY AUDIENCE IN ST. PETER\'S 
SQUARE APRIL 9, POPE JOHN PAUL II URGED THE WORLD TO NOT 
    FORGET THE VIOLENT AND CONTINUING CONFLICT IN THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION OF AFRICA, AND CALLED ON LEADERS TO RETURN TO THE 
PEACE PROCESS.  VATICAN OFFICIALS HAD PASSED EMBASSY A 
PRO-MEMORIA ON MARCH 24 SEEKING U.S. SUPPORT IN STOPPING THE 
VIOLENCE IN THE ITURI REGION OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF 
CONGO AND MAKING PROGRESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS (REFTEL).  IN 
THE FACE OF CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL FOCUS ON IRAQ, THE POPE 
SOUGHT TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE CRISIS IN AFRICA -- A POINT 
HE REITERATED IN HIS APRIL 20 EASTER MESSAGE.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (U) ADDRESSING A GENERAL AUDIENCE APRIL 6 ON THE GREAT 
LAKES CONFLICT, POPE JOHN PAUL II DIRECTED \"A HEARTFELT 
APPEAL TO THE POLITICIANS IN CHARGE, AS WELL AS TO ALL MEN 
AND WOMEN OF GOOD WILL, SO THAT THEY COMMIT THEMSELVES TO 
BRING AN END TO THE VIOLENCE AND ABUSE, PUTTING ASIDE 
PERSONAL SELFISHNESS AND GROUP INTERESTS, WITH THE ACTIVE 
COLLABORATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.\"  THE POPE WAS 
RESPONDING TO REPORTS OF APRIL 6 FROM THE U.N. MISSION IN THE 
CONGO THAT AROUND 1,000 PEOPLE DIED THE WEEK BEFORE IN WHAT 
APPEARED TO BE ETHNIC MASSACRES, INCLUDING SUMMARY 
EXECUTIONS.  RECOGNIZING THAT THIS VIOLENCE BROUGHT WITH IT 
THE POTENTIAL TO REIGNITE MASSIVE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE 
REGION, THE POPE URGED THAT \"EVERY EFFORT AT RECONCILIATION 
AMONG THE CONGOLESE, UGANDAN AND RWANDAN PEOPLES MUST BE 
ENCOURAGED...WITH THE HOPE THAT FROM THESE EFFORTS PEACE 
WHICH IS SO DESIRED, CAN FLOWER.\" 
 
3.  (U) IN HIS EASTER MESSAGE, THE POPE FOLLOWED HIS CALL FOR 
PEACE IN IRAQ WITH A CALL FOR \"PEACE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE 
WORLD, WHERE FORGOTTEN WARS AND PROTRACTED HOSTILITIES ARE 
CAUSING DEATHS AND INJURIES AMID SILENCE AND NEGLECT ON THE 
    PART OF CONSIDERABLE SECTORS OF PUBLIC OPINION.\"  HE 
CAUTIONED THAT THE AFRICAN CONTINENT \"CANNOT BE ABANDONED TO 
ITSELF.\" 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4.  (SBU) THE VATICAN IS DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL 
FOR RENEWED VIOLENCE IN AN ALREADY DEVASTATED REGION.  ADDING 
TO THE POPE\'S WORRIES IS THE FEAR THAT THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS 
TAKEN FOCUS AWAY FROM THE VIOLENT CONFLICT IN AFRICA, AND 
THAT WITHOUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S COLLABORATION, A 
TENUOUS PEACE WILL REVERT TO FURTHER ETHNIC SLAUGHTER.  THE 
POPE\'S STRONG PUBLIC STATEMENT REFLECTS THE HOLY SEE\'S 
CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR PEACE IN THE REGION, AND ITS DESIRE TO 
ENSURE THIS CRISIS IS NOT FORGOTTEN IN THE GLOBAL FOCUS ON 
IRAQ.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (U) SEE ACTION REQUEST PARA. 5. 
 
    2.  (U) IN A DEPARTURE FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S NORMALLY CAUTIOUS 
APPROACH TO CUBA, POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS PUBLICLY DECRIED THE 
EXECUTION OF THREE HIJACKERS AS WELL AS THE HARSH SENTENCES 
RECENTLY HANDED DOWN AGAINST CUBAN DISSIDENTS.  THE POPE\'S 
APRIL 13 APPEAL, WRITTEN ON HIS BEHALF BY SECRETARY OF STATE 
CARDINAL ANGELO SODANO, WAS RELEASED BY THE VATICAN APRIL 26 
FOLLOWING CASTRO\'S APPARENT FAILURE TO RESPOND.   THE LETTER 
CONVEYED THE POPE\'S \"DEEP PAIN\" OVER THE RECENT EXECUTIONS 
AND HEAVY SENTENCES GIVEN TO DISSIDENTS.  IN THE LETTER, THE 
POPE CALLED ON CASTRO TO MAKE A \"SIGNIFICANT GESTURE OF 
CLEMENCY,\" ADDING THAT SUCH A GESTURE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO 
GREATER HARMONY AMONG THE CUBAN PEOPLE.  THE POPE CONCLUDED 
BY SUGGESTING HE WAS SURE THAT CASTRO SHARED THE CONVICTION 
THAT ONLY SINCERE AND CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN CITIZENS 
AND CIVIL AUTHORITIES CAN GUARANTEE THE ADVANCEMENT OF A 
MODERN AND DEMOCRATIC STATE, IN A MORE UNITED AND FRATERNAL 
CUBA. 
 
3. (C) EMBASSY CONTACTED HOLY SEE OFFICIALS APRIL 28 TO 
EXPLORE THE BACKGROUND BEHIND THE VATICAN\'S RELEASE OF THE 
LETTER AND ITS UNUSUAL DIRECT APPEAL TO CASTRO.  COUNTRY 
DIRECTOR FOR CUBA, MONSIGNOR GIORGIO LINGUA TOLD POLOFF THAT 
THE POPE HAD DECIDED TO SEND THE LETTER (DELIVERED TO CUBA\'S 
AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE) AFTER THE HOLY SEE\'S \"QUIET 
DIPLOMACY BEHIND THE SCENES\" HAD FAILED TO EVOKE ANY RESPONSE 
FROM CUBA.  LINGUA UNDERSCORED THAT THE LETTER WAS MEANT TO 
PROTEST BOTH THE EXECUTIONS AND THE HARSH SENTENCES RECENTLY 
IMPOSED ON THE SEVENTY-PLUS CUBAN DISSIDENTS.  HE WOULD NOT 
CHARACTERIZE THE STRONGLY WORDED LETTER AS A NEW DIRECTION IN 
THE HOLY SEE\'S CUBA APPROACH, BUT RATHER HE SAID IT WAS 
NATURAL TO \"STEP UP THE VOLUME\" AFTER THE CASTRO REGIME\'S 
    SUDDEN RATCHETING UP OF REPRESSION AGAINST POLITICAL 
DISSIDENTS, MANY OF WHOM ARE PRACTICING CATHOLICS. 
 
4. (C) DCM ALSO QUERIED VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
PIETRO PAROLIN AS TO WHAT HAD PROMPTED THE PAPAL APPEAL. 
PAROLIN SAID THE DECISIONS TO APPROACH CASTRO DIRECTLY AND TO 
RELEASE THE LETTER WERE TAKEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE CUBAN 
BISHOPS, WHO HAD CONVEYED TO THE HOLY SEE THAT A PAPAL 
INTERVENTION WOULD BE TIMELY AND HELPFUL IN THE FACE OF THE 
CUBAN GOVERNMENT ACTIONS.  DCM WELCOMED THE HOLY SEE\'S 
ENGAGEMENT AND ENCOURAGED CONTINUED EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE 
DISSIDENTS. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  EVEN THOUGH THE HOLY SEE 
IS RELUCTANT TO CHARACTERIZE THE PAPAL LETTER AND PUBLIC 
RELEASE AS A NEW APPROACH IN ITS RELATIONS WITH CUBA, THE 
ACTIONS DO REPRESENT A DEPARTURE FROM THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH 
OUTLINED TO US ONLY A MONTH AGO WHEN LINGUA SPOKE OF THE HOLY 
SEE\'S NEED TO PROTECT THE \"VULNERABLE\" CHURCH PRESENCE IN 
CUBA (REF A).  THERE IS ALSO LITTLE DOUBT THAT DIRECT APPEALS 
TO THE POPE FROM THE SPOUSES OF DETAINED DISSIDENTS, COMBINED 
WITH QUESTIONING LAST WEEK IN THE ITALIAN PRESS ABOUT THE 
HOLY SEE\'S SILENCE IN THE FACE OF THE CUBAN REPRESSION HELPED 
EVOKE THE LETTER\'S RELEASE.  ALTHOUGH THE VATICAN\'S NATURAL 
PREDILECTION IS ALWAYS TO WORK BEHIND THE SCENES, THE SUCCESS 
OF THE POPE\'S JANUARY BROADSIDE AGAINST RUSSIAN RESTRICTIONS 
ON CATHOLIC PRIESTS (REF C) HAS PERHAPS GIVEN ADDED 
SUSTENANCE TO THE VATICAN\'S REGARD FOR THE POTENTIAL OF 
STRONG, PUBLIC ACTIONS IN THE FACE OF INJUSTICE.  WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE HOLY SEE\'S ENGAGEMENT TO EFFECT THE 
RELEASE OF THE DISSIDENTS, AND WOULD WELCOME ANY ADDITIONAL 
    POINTS THAT MIGHT BE OF USE TO SHARE WITH THE VATICAN.

END INFORMAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION. 
 
3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  THROUGHOUT THE IRAQ CRISIS, THE HOLY SEE 
HAS BEEN PREOCCUPIED BY CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF CHRISTIAN 
COMMUNITIES IN IRAQ AND THE IMPACT OF A WAR WAGED BY A 
PREDOMINANTLY CHRISTIAN WEST ON MUSLIM IRAQ.  BEYOND THE 
IMPACT OF WAR, AN ADDITIONAL IMPLICIT CONCERN WAS THE RISK 
THAT AN IRAQ UNFETTERED BY SADDAM\'S REPRESSION COULD TAKE A 
MORE FUNDAMENTALIST TURN THAT COULD LEAD TO NEW RESTRICTIONS 
ON CATHOLIC AND OTHER CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES.  AS NEW 
POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DEVELOPED, WE CAN EXPECT THE HOLY 
SEE AND THE IRAQI BISHOPS TO REMAIN ACTIVE IN PROMOTING THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL GUARANTEES FOR 
A MULTI-ETHNIC, RELIGIOUSLY TOLERANT GOVERNMENT.

HIM BEFORE THE VATICAN CALLED.  THEY CITED THE SARS EPIDEMIC 
AS A REASON TO MOVE QUICKLY TO BRING TAIWAN INTO THE WHO. THE 
HUMANITARIAN FOCUS, TOGETHER WITH THE POTENTIAL SUPPORT OF 
THE USG AND OTHER PLAYERS, ALLOWED THE HOLY SEE IN THIS CASE 
TO VOICE ITS SUPPORT WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING FUTURE DIALOG WITH 
THE PRC ABOUT THE CHURCH\'S STATUS IN CHINA. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  VIGOROUS POPE CELEBRATES 83RD BIRTHDAY BY 
CANONIZING FOUR, RECEIVING DEGREE, AND ADVOCATING HUMAN 
RIGHTS 
 
 
1.(U) AN INCREASINGLY VIGOROUS POPE JOHN PAUL II 
CELEBRATED HIS 83RD BIRTHDAY MAY 18 BY CANONIZING FOUR NEW 
SAINTS IN A MASS BEFORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WELL-WISHERS. 
DESPITE HIS LIMITED MOBILITY, THE POPE WAS IN TOP FORM. 
WITH A STRONG, CLEAR VOICE, HE URGED THOSE PRESENT TO PRAY 
FOR HIM \"SO THAT GOD WILL HELP ME TO FULFILL FAITHFULLY THE 
MISSION HE HAS ENTRUSTED TO ME.\"  VATICAN OBSERVERS HAVE 
    ABANDONED THEIR 2002 SPECULATION THAT THE POPE WOULD RESIGN 
BECAUSE OF ILL HEALTH AND NOW MARVEL AT HIS RENEWED 
STRENGTH AND VITALITY THAT VATICAN OFFICIALS ATTRIBUTE TO A 
REGIME OF SPEECH AND PHYSIOTHERAPY, GOOD DIET AND 
APPROPRIATE MEDICATION FOR PARKINSON\'S DISEASE, WHICH 
SENIOR VATICAN CARDINAL GIOVANNI BATTISTA RE PUBLICLY 
ACKNOWLEDGED MAY 17 AS A SOURCE OF THE POPE\'S DIFFICULTIES. 
 
2.(U) A DAY EARLIER, THE POPE RECEIVED AN HONORARY 
DOCTORATE IN LAW FROM ROME\'S \"LA SAPIENZA\" UNIVERSITY, 
WHICH IS CELEBRATING ITS 700TH ANNIVERSARY.  THE AWARD 
RECOGNIZED THE POPE\'S PAST AND CONTINUING CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
THE UNIVERSAL AFFIRMATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN, OF JUSTICE, 
AND OF PEACE AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND NATIONS. THE CEREMONY, 
ATTENDED BY ITALIAN PM BERLUSCONI AND MEMBERS OF HIS 
GOVERNMENT, BECAME AN OCCASION TO RECALL THE POPE\'S 
QUARTER-CENTURY OF PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS.  IN HIS ADDRESS, 
THE POPE HIGHLIGHTED A FULL AGENDA OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES 
FOR WHICH HE CONTINUES TO FIGHT: THE RIGHT TO HUMAN LIFE 
FROM CONCEPTION TO NATURAL DEATH; JURIDICAL PROTECTION FOR 
THE HUMAN EMBRYO; FREEDOM OF RELIGION; PROTECTION FROM 
DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF RACE, LANGUAGE, RELIGION OR SEX; 
THE RIGHT TO PRIVATE PROPERTY; FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND 
EXPRESSION, PARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL LIFE, AND ECONOMIC 
INITIATIVES; THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION AND CULTURE; THE RIGHT 
OF MINORITIES TO EXIST AND EXPRESS THEIR PARTICULAR 
CULTURE; THE RIGHT TO WORK AND TO WORKERS\' RIGHTS; AND THE 
RIGHT OF THE FAMILY NOT TO BE USURPED BY SOCIETY AND THE 
STATE.  OF THESE RIGHTS, THE POPE EMPHASIZED THE RIGHT TO 
LIFE AS \"THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL,\" WHILE OBSERVING THAT 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM \"WAS NOT SIMPLY ONE RIGHT AMONG OTHERS, 
    BUT THAT TO WHICH ALL THE OTHERS ARE CONNECTED.\" 
 
3.(U) COMMENT: DESPITE SPECULATION BY THE MEDIA AND SO- 
CALLED \"VATICANISTI\" THAT THE HOLY SEE IS \"IN A HOLDING 
PATTERN\" WAITING FOR THE POPE TO DIE, THE REALITY IS QUITE 
DIFFERENT.  THE POPE MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE IF CIRCUMSCRIBED 
DAILY SCHEDULE, GUIDES LONG-TERM INTERNAL DECISION MAKING, 
CONTINUES TO TRAVEL -- THIS YEAR\'S SCHEDULE INCLUDES SPAIN, 
CROATIA, BOSNIA, SLOVAKIA AND MONGOLIA, AND TO PROMOTE HIS 
INTERNATIONAL AGENDA FOCUSED ON RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
AND THE PROMOTION OF HUMAN DIGNITY .  WHILE THE POPE HAS 
SCALED BACK ON SOME ROUTINE BUSINESS, AT 83, HE HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY ADEPT AT CONSERVING HIS ENERGY FOR WHAT IS 
MOST ESSENTIAL TO THE HOLY SEE\'S DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN 
POLICY AGENDA.  END COMMENT.

TAGS: PREL, PINR, VT, UN 
SUBJECT: BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ON SILVANO TOMASI: NEW 
HOLY SEE OBSERVER TO UN AND WTO IN GENEVA 
 
 
1. POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS APPOINTED HIS NUNCIO TO ERITREA, 
ETHIOPIA AND DJIBOUTI, ARCHBISHOP SILVANO TOMASI (AN 
AMERICAN CITIZEN), AS THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER AT 
THE UN OFFICES AND SPECIALIST AGENCIES, AND TO THE WORLD 
TRADE ORGANIZATION IN GENEVA.  TOMASI REPLACES ARCHBISHOP 
DIARMUID MARTIN WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED TO DUBLIN, IRELAND 
    AS AN ASSISTANT BISHOP WITH RIGHT OF SUCCESSION. 
 
2. SILVANO TOMASI WAS BORN IN CASONI DI MUSSOLENTE, IN THE 
NORTHERN ITALIAN PROVINCE OF VICENZA ON OCTOBER 12, 1940. 
HE ENTERED THE SEMINARY OF THE CONGREGATION OF THE 
MISSIONARIES OF ST. CHARLES OR \"SCALABRINIS\" IN NEW YORK 
CITY AND WAS ORDAINED A PRIEST IN 1965. (NOTE. THE 
SCALABRINIS PROVIDE SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL CARE FOR 
MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES.  THEY OPERATE IN 24 NATIONS ON ALL 
FIVE CONTINENTS RUNNING SHELTERS FOR REFUGEES, MIGRANTS IN 
TRANSIT, AND DEPORTED ALIENS.  THEY ALSO PROVIDE SEAFARER 
CENTERS, RETIREMENT VILLAGES FOR ELDERLY MIGRANTS, AND 
CENTERS FOR MIGRATION STUDIES.  THE SCALABRINIS ALSO 
PUBLISH NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES AND PRODUCE RADIO AND 
TELEVISION PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY FOR MIGRANT POPULATIONS. 
END NOTE). 
 
3. TOMASI HOLDS A DOCTORATE IN SOCIAL SCIENCES FROM NEW 
YORK\'S FORDHAM UNIVERSITY.  FROM 1965 UNTIL 1974 HE WORKED 
IN PAROCHIAL MINISTRY, LECTURED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE 
CITY OF NEW YORK, WAS DIRECTOR OF NEW YORK\'S CENTER FOR 
MIGRATION STUDIES AND EDITOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION 
REVIEW.  FROM 1975-1980 AND 1987-1989 TOMASI SERVED AS 
SUPERIOR OF THE NEW YORK PROVINCE (U.S. EAST COAST, CANADA, 
VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA) OF THE SCALABRINI MISSIONARIES. IN 
1983 HE BECAME THE FIRST DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. BISHOPS 
CONFERENCE OFFICE FOR THE PASTORAL CARE OF MIGRANTS AND 
REFUGEES.  TOMASI WAS CALLED TO ROME IN 1989 TO SERVE AS 
SECRETARY (NUMBER TWO) AT THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE 
 
SIPDIS 
PASTORAL CARE OF MIGRANTS AND ITINERANT PEOPLES.  POPE JOHN 
PAUL II APPOINTED HIM AS NUNCIO IN ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA IN 
    1996.  TOMASI WAS ORDAINED AN ARCHBISHOP THE SAME YEAR.  IN 
2000 HIS ACCREDITATION WAS EXTENDED TO DJIBOUTI.  HE ALSO 
SERVED AS THE HOLY SEE\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO THE 
ORGANIZATION FOR AFRICAN UNITY.  THE POPE NOMINATED HIM AS 
THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER AT THE UN OFFICES AND 
SPECIALIST AGENCIES AND TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION IN 
GENEVA ON JUNE 10, 2003. 
 
4. COMMENT:  GIVEN ARCHBISHOP TOMASI\'S STRONG INTEREST IN 
MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES, WE EXPECT HIM TO BE A FORCEFUL 
ADVOCATE ON THOSE ISSUES AT THE UNHCR AND RELATED AGENCIES. 
TOMASI, LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR MARTIN, STANDS OUT AMONG HOLY 
SEE DIPLOMATS IN THAT HE DID NOT PASS THROUGH THE 
ECCLESIASTICAL ACADEMY -- THE VATICAN\'S PRESTIGIOUS 
DIPLOMATIC TRAINING SCHOOL.  HIS BACKGROUND IS MORE WITHIN 
THE CHURCH\'S \"GRASS ROOTS.\"  THE ARCHBISHOP IS KNOWN TO BE 
A REALIST, BUT QUINTESSENTIALLY DIPLOMATIC.  HIS TERM IN 
ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA HAS MADE HIM PARTICULARLY ATTUNED TO 
THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE SITUATION OF DEVELOPING NATIONS. 
VATICAN WATCHERS SAY TOMASI WILL BRING FLAIR TO HIS WORK, 
COMBINING AMERICAN REALISM WITH ITALIAN SUBTLETY -- TRAITS 
THAT STOOD OUT WHEN HE SERVED ON THE HOLY SEE\'S ACTIVE 
DELEGATION AT THE UN\'S 1994 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON 
POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN CAIRO.  END COMMENT.

1.   SUMMARY:  THE VATICAN\'S FIFTH WORLD CONGRESS OF THE 
PASTORAL CARE OF GYPSIES WILL TAKE PLACE IN BUDAPEST, 
HUNGARY FROM JUNE 30 TO JULY 6.  THE CONGRESS WILL FOCUS ON 
 
THE PASTORAL NEEDS OF THE ROMA, BUT WILL ALSO INCLUDE 
LECTURES AND WORKSHOPS ON EDUCATIONAL NEEDS, INTEGRATION, 
AND THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN THE FORMATION OF A CULTURE OF 
    SOLIDARITY AND TOLERANCE.  NATIONAL CATHOLIC CHURCH 
DIRECTORS FOR ROMA ISSUES WILL ALSO PREPARE A DOCUMENT AT 
THE CONGRESS ADDRESSING GLOBAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE THE CARE 
OF ROMA.  THE CONGRESS IS BEING HELD OUTSIDE OF THE VATICAN 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A SHOW OF RECOGNITION FOR THE EFFORTS 
OF THE HUNGARIAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE AND HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT 
TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION OF ROMA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  SECRETARY OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE PASTORAL 
CARE OF MIGRANTS AND ITINERANT PEOPLES, ARCHBISHOP AGOSTINO 
MARCHETTO TOLD POLOFF AND POL ASSISTANT JUNE 26 THAT THE 
VATICAN\'S FIFTH WORLD CONGRESS OF THE PASTORAL CARE OF 
GYPSIES WILL BRING TOGETHER 150 REPRESENTATIVES FROM 25 
EPISCOPAL CONFERENCES WORLDWIDE.  MOST PARTICIPANTS, WHO 
WILL FOCUS ON THE PASTORAL CARE OF GYPSIES, REPRESENT 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, BUT THE U.S., INDIA, MEXICO, AND BRAZIL 
-- ALL OF WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT ROMA POPULATIONS -- WILL 
ALSO BE REPRESENTED.  PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE NATIONAL 
DIRECTORS FOR ROMA ISSUES, PRIESTS, MEN AND WOMEN RELIGIOUS, 
LAY PASTORAL AGENTS, AND ROMA.  AMONG THE ROMA, THERE ARE 15 
CATHOLIC PRIESTS, NUNS, AND STUDENTS, WHO WILL PARTICIPATE 
IN AN EDUCATION ROUND TABLE. 
 
3.  WHILE THE CONGRESS WILL REVIEW BROADER ISSUES RELATING 
TO INTEGRATION OF ROMA, MARCHETTO NOTED THAT THESE ISSUES 
WOULD BE EXAMINED PRIMARILY IN THE CONTEXT OF PASTORAL CARE 
FOR THE ROMA.  NEVERTHELESS, MARCHETTO EMPHASIZED THAT THE 
HOLY SEE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF THE DIGNITY OF 
THE ROMA AND THEIR TREATMENT IN SOCIETY.  HE POINTED OUT 
THAT THE VATICAN FREQUENTLY ADVOCATES ON THEIR BEHALF TO 
LOCAL AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS.  IN THIS REGARD, HE ALSO 
    OBSERVED THAT THE HOLY SEE\'S INTEREST ENGAGED A NUMBER OF 
VATICAN COUNCILS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL `COR 
UNUM\' WHICH COORDINATES VATICAN HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS 
WORLDWIDE HELPS PROVIDE FOR ROMA MATERIAL NEEDS, WHILE THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE EXAMINES GOVERNMENT 
POLICIES AFFECTING ROMA.  MARCHETTO ELABORATED  THAT HIS OWN 
COUNCIL FOR MIGRANTS HAD FOUR OFFICES DEALING WITH THE 
PASTORAL NEEDS OF REFUGEES, MIGRANTS, AND OTHER NOMADS (I.E. 
CIRCUS WORKERS, PILGRIMS, FISHERMEN), AND `PEOPLE OF THE 
ROAD, INCLUDING RAILWAY AND AIRPORT WORKERS, SEAFARERS, 
FOREIGN STUDENTS. 
 
4.  IN A DISCUSSION OF USG EFFORTS TO ADDRESS ROMA ISSUES, 
MARCHETTO MADE A POINT TO URGE THE USG NOT TO GIVE HUMAN 
RIGHTS SHORT-SHRIFT IN OUR FOCUS ON THE WAR ON TERRORISM. 
WHILE UNDERSTANDING THE NEED FOR NEW SECURITY POLICIES, 
MARCHETTO SAID HE HOPES THE PENDULUM WILL SWING BACK AND THE 
U.S. WILL RETURN TO ITS HISTORIC \"DESTINY\" OF OFFERING 
OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM TO THE WORLD\'S REFUGEES, MIGRANT 
WORKERS AND FOREIGN STUDENTS.  HE URGED THE USG TO CONSIDER 
SIGNING THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE PROTECTION OF 
THE RIGHTS OF ALL MIGRANT WORKERS AND MEMBERS OF THEIR 
FAMILIES.  HE EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THAT ONLY 21 
COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED ON AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS AND NO 
INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IS YET A SIGNATORY. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  DESPITE THE CONGRESS\'S PRIMARY FOCUS ON 
PASTORAL ISSUES, WE EXPECT THE CONGRESS TO DEVOTE 
CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES SUCH AS EDUCATION, 
INTEGRATION, AND THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN SHAPING 
PERCEPTIONS OF ROMA.  BEYOND THE VATICAN, MANY CATHOLIC- 
    AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE LAY CATHOLIC SANT\' 
EGIDIO COMMUNITY REMAIN ACTIVE IN ASSISTING THE ROMA 
COMMUNITIES IN ITALY AND ELSEWHERE.  OFTEN, HOWEVER, LOCAL 
PARISHES TAKE LITTLE INTEREST IN ROMA ISSUES AND CAN 
SOMETIMES BE HOSTILE.  OUR SANT\' EGIDIO CONTACTS RECENTLY 
TOOK US TO COFFEE HOSTED BY A ROMA FAMILY FROM BOSNIA. 
BETWEEN GUSTS OF WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE LARGE HOLES IN THE 
WALLS OF THEIR SHACK THE FAMILY EXPLAINED THAT THEY RECEIVED 
LITTLE HELP FROM THEIR LOCAL CHURCH OR THE ITALIAN 
GOVERNMENT.  OUR SANT\' EGIDIO HOSTS EXPLAINED THAT THE LOCAL 
PARISH PRIEST HAD LOBBIED THE GOVERNMENT TO REMOVE THE ROMA 
ENCAMPMENT.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE HOLY SEE TO 
SHARE INFORMATION EMERGING FROM THE CONGRESS WIDELY WITHIN 
BISHOP\'S CONFERENCES, ND TO KEEP ROMA ISSUES AT THE 
FOREFRONT OF THE VTICAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA.

A CONVENTION THAT WOULD BAN ALL HUMAN CLONING.  PAROLIN 
CONFIRMED THAT THE VATICAN REMAINS FIRMLY OPPOSED TO ANY TYPE 
OF EMBRYONIC CLONING AND WILL FULLY SUPPORT THE COSTA RICA 
RESOLUTION.  SIGNIFICANTLY, PAROLIN AVOIDED PREVIOUS VATICAN 
CAVEATS ABOUT ACCEPTING A BAN ON REPRODUCTIVE CLONING IF A 
FULL BAN COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED AND EXPRESSED STRONG 
OPPOSITION TO ANY COMPROMISE THAT WOULD ACCEPT 
&EXPERIMENTAL8 OR &THERAPEUTIC8 CLONING.  THE VATICAN NOW 
APPEARS FULLY COMMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES\' STRATEGY 
TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON ALL TYPES OF EMBRYONIC 
CLONING. 
 
3.  REFLECTING THIS COMMITMENT, PAROLIN TOLD DCM THAT THE 
HOLY SEE WAS IN THE FINAL STAGES OF PREPARING A COMPREHENSIVE 
DOCUMENT OUTLINING THE VATICAN\'S POSITION ON CLONING.  THE 
PAPER, WHICH HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY HOLY SEE UN PERMREP 
    MIGLIORE, WILL BE SHARED WIDELY WITHIN THE UN, INCLUDING ALL 
UN MISSIONS, AND WILL ALSO BE SENT TO NUNCIOS AND BISHOPS IN 
KEY TARGET COUNTRIES.  DCM PROVIDED PAROLIN WITH THE REFTEL 
LIST OF COUNTRIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL ENGAGEMENT, 
AND HE AGREED TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW DOCUMENT WAS SENT TO ALL 
OF THE KEY COUNTRIES AS WELL AS OTHERS.  PAROLIN STRESSED 
THAT EACH OF THE PAPER\'S POINTS WILL BE PRUDENTIAL AND ROOTED 
IN SCIENCE.  FURTHERMORE, THE VATICAN WILL PRESENT ADULT STEM 
CELL RESEARCH AS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE TO EMBRYONIC CLONING. 
THE PAPER WAS TO BE COMPLETED AND DISTRIBUTED BY THE END OF 
JULY.  IN FACT, PAROLIN LEFT THE MEETING TO ATTEND A MEETING 
TO FINALIZE SOME DRAFTING ELEMENTS FOR THE PAPER. 
 
4.  DCM SUBSEQUENTLY MET WITH ARCHBISHOP LOZANO BARRAGAN JULY 
11.  BARRAGAN RECALLED HIS MEETING WITH HHS SECRETARY TOMMY 
THOMPSON AND OFFERED HIS FULL SUPPORT FOR THE COSTA RICAN 
RESOLUTION.  HE PLEDGED THAT THE HOLY SEE &WILL DO OUR 
BEST8 TO INFLUENCE TARGET COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN 
TO BAN ALL FORMS OF CLONING.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE CAUTIONED 
THAT IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, THE GOVERNMENTS\' 
COMPLEX RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE SOMETIMES LIMITS HOW HARD 
THE NUNCIOS AND BISHOPS CAN PUSH HOST GOVERNMENTS.

1. (C) VATICAN ACTING FM MONSIGNOR PIETRO PAROLIN TOLD A/S

HOLY SEE NOTED THAT IT WAS INTENSIFYING ITS COLLABORATION 
WITH THE UN IN AFRICA, WHILE THE SANT\' EGIDIO COMMUNITY

U.S. SUPPORT FOR TURKEY\'S ENTRY TO THE EU, WHICH THE HOLY SEE 
INDICATED IT WOULD NOT OPPOSE ONCE TURKEY HAD MADE GREATER 
PROGRESS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  PAROLIN INDICTED THAT THE 
SITUATION OF CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN RUSSIA WAS IMPROVING, EXCEPT

2. (C) MEETING JULY 17 AT THE VATICAN WITH ACTING FM 
MONSIGNOR PIETRO PAROLIN AND IN ROME WITH SANT\' EGIDIO 
COMMUNITY LEADERS, A/S JONES EMPHASIZED THAT SECRETARY POWELL 
DEPENDED ON THE HOLY SEE\'S MORAL AUTHORITY TO HELP PRODUCE 
RESULTS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND IRAQ, AS 
WELL AS ON GLOBAL ISSUES SUCH AS HIV/AIDS, TRAFFICKING IN 
    PERSONS, AND BIOTECH FOODS.  PAROLIN COMMENTED THAT SECRETARY 
POWELL\'S JUNE 2 MEETING WITH THE POPE AND SECRETARY OF STATE 
SODANO HAD BEEN \"FRUITFUL\" AND MUCH APPRECIATED IN THE 
VATICAN. 
 
3. (C) SINCE THE SECRETARY\'S DISCUSSIONS ON THE SITUATION IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST, A/S JONES NOTED THAT MUCH HAD BEEN DONE TO 
MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD.  WITH ABU MAZEN BEING INVITED TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE, FOLLOWED BY A VISIT BY PM SHARON, A JOINT 
MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS, AND SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS IN 
EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA, JONES OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS SOME 
MOMENTUM BEHIND THE PEACE PROCESS.  TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THIS, ABU MAZEN NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO SHOW RESULTS TO SHORE UP 
HIS POSITION INTERNALLY.  SHE EMPHASIZED THAT THE SECRETARY 
WAS LOOKING TO THE HOLY SEE TO HELP BUILD UP ABU MAZEN SO HE 
HAS THE AUTHORITY HE NEEDS TO MAKE AGREEMENTS WITH SHARON FOR 
PEACE.  PAROLIN INDICATED THAT HE HAD RECENTLY MET WITH 
ISRAELI FM SILVAN SHALOM AND HAD EMPHASIZED TWO POINTS:  THE 
HOLY SEE\'S SUPPORT FOR THE ROAD MAP AND THE NEED TO BUILD A 
CONFIDENT ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  IN THIS REGARD, 
THE HOLY SEE HAD APPEALED TO THE ISRAELIS TO \"REFRAIN FROM 
RETALIATION\" IN ORDER TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. 
SHALOM\'S RESPONSE WAS SIMPLY TO REITERATE THAT \"SECURITY IS 
VERY IMPORTANT TO US.\" 
 
4. (C) SANT\' EGIDIO\'S LEADERSHIP TOLD A/S JONES THAT THEY HAD 
JUST RETURNED FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE THEY HAD MET WITH 
BOTH ABU MAZEN AND SHARON.  SANT\' EGIDIO\'S BETTI LAMENTED 
THAT CATHOLIC PALESTINIAN PATRIARCH MICHAEL SABBAH WAS NOT 
YET BEHIND ABU MAZEN, BUT SAID THEY HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO 
EMBRACE MAZEN, WHO, UNLIKE ARAFAT, CAN DELIVER ON HIS

FOCUS ON AFRICA:  HIV/AIDS AND BIOTECH FOODS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) A/S JONES REVIEWED FOR PAROLIN AND SANT\' EGIDIO THE 
PRESIDENT\'S TRIP TO AFRICA, NOTING THAT IT HAD GENERATED 
GREATER INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION FOR U.S. EFFORTS TO MEET THE 
CHALLENGE OF HIV/AIDS AND TO USE THE PROMISE OF BIOTECH FOODS 
TO MEET THE CONTINENT\'S NUTRITION NEEDS.  JONES EMPHASIZED 
THAT AFRICA HAS BEEN A CONTINUING PRIORITY FOR THE PRESIDENT, 
WHO RECOGNIZED EARLY ON THAT HIV/AIDS WAS WIPING OUT WHOLE 
GENERATIONS OF TEACHERS, FARMERS, HEALTH WORKERS AND OTHER 
KEY SECTORS OF PEOPLE ESSENTIAL TO AFRICA\'S DEVELOPMENT. 
PAROLIN WELCOMED THIS ATTENTION, OBSERVING THAT THE HOLY SEE 
VIEWS AFRICA AS A \"FORGOTTEN CONTINENT\" AND CONTINUES TO 
ADVOCATE FOR GREATER INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT.  FOR ITS PART, 
THE HOLY SEE HAS INTENSIFIED ITS COLLABORATION WITH THE UN ON 
AFRICA FOLLOWING A FEBRUARY MEETING BETWEEN KOFI ANNAN AND 
THE POPE.  SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE VATICAN\'S 
DICASTRIES (MINISTRY EQUIVALENTS) ARE MEETING NOW TO DEVELOP 
SPECIFIC INITIATIVES FOR THIS NEW COLLABORATION, PAROLIN 
INDICATED. 
 
8. (SBU) REGARDING BIOTECH FOODS, PAROLIN TOLD A/S JONES THAT 
THE HOLY SEE WAS \"BUILDING A POSITION\" AND HOPED TO BE ABLE 
TO ARRIVE AT A CLEAR VIEW THAT COULD BE SHARED WITH BISHOPS 
    AND NUNCIOS.  FOR THE TIME BEING, HE SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS 
\"NOT AGAINST, AND NOT IN FAVOR.\"  AT THE SAME TIME, THE 
VATICAN RECOGNIZED THE MORAL IMPORTANCE OF FEEDING THE 
HUNGRY, AND WAS CONSIDERING AN INTERIM POSITION THAT WOULD 
EMPHASIZE THE SAFETY OF FOODS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, WHILE 
RESERVING JUDGMENT ON AGRICULTURAL USES UNTIL THEY HAD 
EXAMINED THE ISSUE MORE CLOSELY.  A/S JONES SAID THE U.S. HAS 
FOCUSED ON BIOTECH FOODS IN TERMS OF THE BENEFITS THEY COULD 
BRING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE.  SHE ADDED THAT 
WE \"CAN\'T IMAGINE WHY SUCH FOOD SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO 
PEOPLE WHO WANT IT, AND WHY SUCH TECHNOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE 
AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO WANT TO GROW BIOTECH CROPS.\"  PAROLIN 
SAID IT APPEARED TO THE HOLY SEE THAT THE EU WAS SOFTENING 
ITS POSITION, AND A/S JONES SAID WE WERE PRESSING THE EU TO 
EASE UP ON ITS RESTRICTIONS.  AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON EMPHASIZED 
THAT THE KEY QUESTION THAT ALL PARTIES NEEDED TO REFLECT ON 
WAS WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM DYING OF 
HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION-RELATED DISEASE. 
 
9. (SBU) A/S JONES EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE HOLY SEE\'S 
AND SANT\' EGIDIO\'S ONGOING WORK TO PREVENT AND TREAT 
HIV/AIDS.  SANT\' EGIDIO\'S BETTI OUTLINED THE COMMUNITY\'S 
ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT PROGRAM IN MOZAMBIQUE, WHICH HE 
EMPHASIZED WAS EXACTLY IN LINE WITH THE PRESIDENT\'S EMERGENCY 
FUND GOALS.  HE WELCOMED RECENT INDICATIONS OF SUPPORT THAT 
SANT\' EGIDIO HAD RECEIVED FOR THE PROJECT FROM HHS SECRETARY 
TOMMY THOMPSON AND U/S DOBRIANSKY DURING RECENT MEETINGS. 
BETTI CAUTIONED THAT THE U.S. WAS LIKELY TO RUN INTO A STRONG 
HEADWIND FROM MANY RECIPIENT COUNTRIES, WHO WILL WANT TO USE 
THE NEW FUND FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT TREATMENT -- WHICH THEY 
CONSIDER TOO EXPENSIVE.  RECOGNIZING THIS ISSUE, HOWEVER, 
    BETTI POINTED OUT THAT HIV/AIDS SHOULD BE SEEN NOT ONLY AS A 
PROBLEM, BUT ALSO AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESHAPE AFRICAN HEALTH 
SYSTEMS.  BETTI INFORMED A/S JONES THAT SANT\' EGIDIO WAS 
PREPARING A CONFERENCE AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY THIS FALL 
AIMED AT BUILDING SUPPORT FOR THE MEDICAL CASE FOR TREATMENT 
AND EXPLORING BEST WAYS TO APPROACH THIS TASK.  JONES 
WELCOMED SANT\' EGIDIO\'S INITIATIVE, AND URGED THAT THE

TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
---------------------- 

10.  (SBU) POINTING OUT THAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS WAS BOTH 
A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE AND ONE OF BORDER SECURITY, A/S JONES 
REVIEWED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS 
SCOURGE, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTIVE FOCUS DURING THE DUTCH OSCE 
PRESIDENCY.  PAROLIN EMPHASIZED THE VATICAN\'S SUPPORT FOR 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING INITIATIVES, NOTING THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
ENGAGED WITH THE COUNCIL FOR EUROPE, WHICH IS ESTABLISHING A 
WORKING GROUP TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE.  PAROLIN INDICATED THAT 
THE VATICAN WAS LIKELY TO APPOINT A WOMAN TO HEAD THEIR 
DELEGATION AS A SIGN OF THEIR RECOGNITION OF THE 
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT TRAFFICKING HAS ON WOMEN.

11. (C) RESPONDING TO A RECENT STATEMENT FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S

TURKEY\'S FITNESS FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, A/S JONES SAID THE U.S. 
VIEWED TURKEY AS WANTING A EUROPEAN FUTURE.  THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT HAD GIVEN PRIORITY TO PASSING NEW LEGISLATION THAT 
WILL ALLOW TURKEY TO MEET EU CRITERIA, SHE POINTED OUT, AND 
THE CHALLENGE NOW WAS TO ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION.  HERE, TOO, 
SHE NOTED, WE HAD SEEN TURKEY TAKE POSITIVE STEPS.  PAROLIN 
ASKED WHETHER THE U.S. WAS CONVINCED TURKEY WANTS TO BE IN 
THE EU, OBSERVING THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD HEARD SUGGESTIONS 
THAT THIS WAS A \"FACADE.\"  JONES SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD 
SUCH A SUGGESTION AND THAT ALL THE INDICATIONS WE HAD FROM 
TURKEY REFLECTED A GENUINE COMMITMENT TO EU MEMBERSHIP. 
PAROLIN AFFIRMED THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION THAT THE 
    INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY \"MUST HELP TURKEY,\" AND STRESSED THAT 
THE VATICAN WAS \"NOT AGAINST TURKEY\'S ENTRY TO THE EU.\" 
NEVERTHELESS, THEY BELIEVED TURKEY HAD TO MEET THE EU\'S 
CRITERIA ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND IMPLEMENT 
THEM.  \"SO FAR,\" HE ADDED, \" THE STEPS TAKEN ARE NOT ENOUGH.\" 
 A/S JONES ASKED PAROLIN WHETHER THE HOLY SEE HAD A GOOD 
DIALOGUE WITH TURKEY ON THESE ISSUES.  HE RESPONDED THAT 
THERE WAS A GOOD DIALOGUE, IN WHICH THE HOLY SEE HAD INVOLVED 
EU MEMBERS, BUT THAT TURKEY HAD REACTED NEGATIVELY ON KEY 
ISSUES.  SPECIFICALLY, PAROLIN NOTED THAT THE CHURCH HAD NO 
JURIDICAL STANDING, AND WAS NOT ALLOWED TO OWN PROPERTY. 
WHILE THERE IS FREEDOM OF WORSHIP, TURKEY DOES NOT ALLOW FOR 
FREE RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION IN PUBLIC.  A/S JONES ENCOURAGED 
THE HOLY SEE TO CONTINUE TO PRESS THEIR CONCERNS, POINTING 
OUT THAT WE, TOO, OFTEN HAD TO OVERCOME NEGATIVE TURKISH 
REACTIONS BEFORE MAKING PROGRESS.

RUSSIA:  SITUATION IMPROVING DESPITE HASSLES 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) ASKED ABOUT THE SITUATION FOR CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN 
RUSSIA THAT HAD PROVOKED A PAPAL LETTER TO PRESIDENT PUTIN 
LAST YEAR, PAROLIN INDICATED THAT THE SITUATION WAS MUCH 
IMPROVED.  RUSSIA IS NOW WILLING TO RECEIVE THE PRIESTS AND 
ALLOW THEM TO WORK.  THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEM IS THE SHORT 
LENGTH OF THE VISAS ISSUED TO THE PRIESTS -- THREE MONTHS -- 
WHICH THE HOLY SEE REGARDS AS GRATUITOUS BUREAUCRATIC 
HASSLING THAT REQUIRES PRIESTS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY ONCE 
EVERY THREE MONTHS.  THEY ARE IN DISCUSSION WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, AND BELIEVE THEIR NEW 
    NUNCIO IN MOSCOW HAS MADE PROGRESS IN BUILDING A CONSTRUCTIVE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES.  THE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, ON THE OTHER HAND, REMAINS 
DIFFICULT.  THE RUSSIAN PATRIARCH\'S ILL HEALTH HAS ALSO MADE 
PROGRESS DIFFICULT, AS THE CHURCH IS CURRENTLY IN A HOLDING 
PATTERN IN ITS DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE.  A/S JONES NOTED 
THAT WE HAVE RAISED HOLY SEE CONCERNS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
ISSUES AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL AND WOULD BE WILLING TO DO SO 
IN THE FUTURE IF NECESSARY.  PAROLIN WELCOMED THIS 
COMMITMENT, AND AGREED TO KEEP THE U.S. APPRISED OF PROGRESS.

SUBJECT:  Caritas on North Korea:  Unified, Willing to 
\"Fight to the Last Drop\" of Blood, But Still Hungry 
 
REF: 02 VATICAN 3637 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (u) Catholic Church relief network Caritas works with 
the people of North Korea to combat poverty and 
malnutrition.  Post recently met with Kathi Zellweger, who 
oversees Caritas\' operations in North Korea and who spends 
considerable time there, to review developments in that 
country.  Zellweger reported that: (1) the firmly unified 
North Korean populace shows no indication of challenging 
its government; (2) the people believe attack by the United 
States is imminent and unavoidable; (3) the government is 
increasingly willing to experiment with capitalism; and (4) 
food availability in the DPRK has increased but is 
irregular.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
North Koreans \"will fight to the last drop\" of blood 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2.  (u) \"Unity is high,\" Zellweger said, and North Koreans 
\"will fight to the last drop\" of blood for their nation. 
The Chong-il regime will continue for many more years, she 
believes, even as it sacrifices millions of lives through 
poverty, malnutrition, and repression.  Communist 
indoctrination in North Korea has been exhaustive.  With 
most North Koreans having grown up under Communism and 
without exposure to any other way of life (even cut off 
from Western television), the relatively high levels of 
education and literacy have failed to generate any youth 
movements for change. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
North Koreans Believe U.S. Attack Imminent 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (u) Based on their reading of U.S. involvement in Iraq, 
as presented by state news agencies, the people of the DPRK 
are convinced, according to Zellweger, that attack by the 
United States is imminent.  The invasion of Iraq even after 
inspectors were admitted, the \"dubious\" justifications for 
that war, and the classification of North Korea as a member 
of the \"axis of evil\" have made many North Koreans believe 
they are next in line for American-imposed regime change. 
The people of North Korea feel doomed, Zellweger added. 
The commitment to fight against any aggressor has been 
fueled by DPRK indoctrination, starvation, poverty, and an 
unprecedented sense of unity. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Special Economic Zones and Capitalism 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (u) Although North Korea has established a special 
economic zone in the northeast region of Rajin-Sonbong to 
develop trade relations with Russia, Japan, and China, 
Zellweger believes this has largely failed.  Business 
leaders from China, the most promising trade partner, avoid 
the inconvenient and uncomfortable trip into the region. 
As a result, the North Koreans are hoping that a planned 
second special region closer to the border with China and 
along the train route to Beijing will have more success. 
While it expounds communist theory, the DPRK regime is 
increasingly willing to experiment with limited and 
controlled elements of a market system.  Twelve months ago, 
prices were set for certain goods and services previously 
provided by the State.  Zellweger has noticed that the 
expanded use of a monetary system to pay for goods and 
services (as opposed to government handouts) has given rise 
to a more price-conscious public.  She hears complaints 
that goods are overpriced and unaffordable.  She said that 
with the movement towards some basic market mechanisms, the 
people appear increasingly interested in planning and 
dreaming of a better future that could even include 
tourism. 
 
------------- 
Hunger Update 
------------- 
 
5.(u) In this fiftieth year of the divided Korean 
peninsula, circumstances in North Korea remain grim, 
Zellweger said.  Although food availability has increased 
and acute malnutrition has decreased since the crest of the 
crisis in 1995-1997, North Korea is still heavily dependent 
on international food aid.  The recent WFP announcement of 
 
 
food aid cuts to North Korea will affect some three million 
of the country\'s current 6.4 million beneficiaries.  The 
most pressing humanitarian problem is the shortage of food. 
Cereals, pulses, soymilk, sugar, and cooking oil are 
desperately needed before the year is up.  Contributing to 
the problem is the lag time between donation and delivery. 
Food donations typically take six months to reach 
recipients, Zellweger pointed out. 
 
---------------------- 
Caritas in North Korea 
---------------------- 
 
6.  (u) Caritas is permitted extended visits to North Korea 
and relatively unrestricted contact with the people.  It 
has regular access to 162 of North Korea\'s 260 counties, 
encompassing 85 percent of the DPRK\'s population. 
Zellweger has documented living conditions during many of 
her visits to the country.  The films have been edited into 
a six-and-a-half-minute video.  Zellweger agreed to provide 
a copy to Post. 
 
7.(u) Caritas works in North Korea to increase the 
number of people fed, maximize the nutritional value of 
food provided, and realize their \"helping people to help 
themselves\" principle.  To these ends, Caritas has 
developed two new initiatives: (1) fish farming and fish 
egg distribution and (2) sweet potato harvesting and 
nutritional fortification.  Both plans, as well as Caritas\' 
seed distribution program, aim to cultivate self- 
sufficiency and combat starvation. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
8.(sbu) Zellweger is a significant source of information 
on North Korea, as her access allows for a rare view into 
o 
conditions throughout the DPRK.  Zellweger\'s main message 
for the USG is to \"send more food.\"  Zellweger seems 
relatively optimistic that economic engagement will 
contribute significantly to North Korea in time opening up 
to the West as well as helping to achieve better living 
conditions for its longsuffering people. End comment.

SUBJECT: TAKING THE VATICAN TO TASK ON CRITICISM OF U.S. 
POLICY TOWARD MUSLIM WORLD 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Jim Nicholson:  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Following a post-Iraq war interview in which the 
Vatican\'s senior official for inter-religious dialogue had 
suggested the Administration\'s language during the Iraq war 
could have created a conviction in the Muslim world that the 
war was a war of religion, the Ambassador challenged the 
official to justify this assertion and outlined USG efforts 
to reach out to the Muslim world since September 11. 
Archbishop Michael Fitzgerald, President of the Council for 
Inter-religious Dialogue, acknowledged that his statement had 
been inaccurate, but defended it as a reflection of views he 
had heard from his contacts in the Muslim world.  Fitzgerald 
welcomed U.S. initiatives to engage the Muslim world, and 
agreed on the importance of working together to overcome 
perceived divisions rather than add to them. End Summary 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Setting the Record Straight on U.S.-Muslim Relations 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (C) Archbishop Michael Fitzgerald, President of the 
Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue -- the 
Vatican dicastry responsible for relations with the Muslim 
world -- had sharply criticized the Administration\'s language 
and tone in conducting the Iraq war in a late April 
interview, asserting that alleged references to God and 
messianic tones would \"boost the impression in Muslim world 
that the war taking place is a war of religion.\"  He further 
suggested that many Christian leaders in the U.S. had \"marked 
their distance from President Bush on account of the language 
he uses.\"  Following this interview, the Ambassador had 
written Fitzgerald requesting an opportunity to discuss the 
prelate\'s misperceptions. 
 
3. (C) Meeting with Fitzgerald July 22, Ambassador Nicholson 
challenged Fitzgerald\'s statements, pointing out that the 
President had neither invoked God\'s name to justify war nor 
employed messianic language that would in any way suggest 
that the Iraq war should be seen as a religious struggle.  On 
the contrary, the Ambassador pointed out that the President 
had gone out of his way to reach out to the Muslim world and 
to emphasize America\'s respect for the Muslim faith and 
Muslim people.  He recalled the President\'s post-September 11 
visit to the Washington mosque, his hosting of Iftaar 
dinners, and meetings with Muslim leaders.  He also pointed 
out that the U.S. has repeatedly acted in defense of and to 
provide liberty to Muslim populations in Kuwait, Bosnia, and 
Afghanistan and Iraq.  The Ambassador emphasized that 
statements such as this from the Holy See could be seen as an 
affirmation by extremists for their critical views of the 
U.S.  Given that the U.S. and Holy See were both seeking to 
overcome perceptions of division between the West and the 
Muslim world, the Ambassador concluded, Fitzgerald\'s 
statement \"really sets us back.\" 
 
4. (C) Fitzgerald acknowledged the inaccuracy of his 
statements and the potential for misunderstanding they could 
generate.  At the same time, he expressed his strong 
objection to the U.S. characterization of Iran, Iraq, and 
North Korea as an \"axis of evil,\" saying he did not regard 
the people of those countries as evil.  The Ambassador 
pointed out that the term referred to the oppressive 
governments of those countries, and not the people who 
suffered under them.  While begrudgingly acknowledging the 
Ambassador\'s point, Fitzgerald asserted that people in those 
countries nevertheless felt they were being branded as evil. 
Fitzgerald further defended his comments as reflective of 
comments he has heard from many in the Muslim world, noting 
that whether or not the perceptions reflected the reality of 
U.S. policy, they did exist.  He also noted that vituperative 
criticism of the Muslim world by leading Christian voices in 
the U.S. seen as close to the Administration had strengthened 
this perception and \"damned the USG by association.\" 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Pope\'s Statements Defused Religious Clash 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Regarding broader relations between Christians and 
Muslims, Fitzgerald indicated that the Pope\'s opposition to 
war actually helped minimize the perception of division 
between the Christian and Muslim faiths, making clear that 
Christianity and the West are not one and the same.  He 
believes the Pope\'s statements were instrumental in 
convincing many in the Muslim world that the war was not an 
 
 
attack on Islam. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Working Together to Overcome Divisions 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador emphasized the U.S. commitment to 
improving relations with Muslim countries and indicated that 
he believed the U.S. and Holy See could both advance our 
shared goals by better coordinating our outreach efforts. 
The Ambassador outlined Embassy planning for a cultural event 
in the next year that would seek to bring together Christian, 
Muslim, and Jewish performers, and suggested that this could 
offer a vehicle for additional engagement.  Fitzgerald 
welcomed this initiative and agreed to consider how to expand 
Muslim participation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Vatican-Muslim Dialogue Still Lacking Partners 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. (C) Turning to recent activities of Fitzgerald\'s Council, 
the Ambassador inquired about the status of the Holy See\'s 
outreach activities to the Muslim world.  Fitzgerald pointed 
out that Muslim leaders had opted out of a recent meeting in 
Damascus, leaving Christian leaders from Muslim countries to 
discuss the state of relations among themselves. 
Acknowledging his frustrations, Fitzgerald observed that 
\"unfortunately the Holy See does not choose its own partners 
(who are often selected by governments and are often not 
religious leaders).  He also noted that Muslims who 
participate in dialogue with the Holy See are often 
criticized at home. On the plus side, Fitzgerald observed 
that the Holy See and its Muslim partners have been able to 
address issues that they would not have been able to talk 
about a few years ago, such as the situation of Christians in 
Muslim-majority countries.  He welcomed recent developments 
in Qatar where the Emir has expressed interest in developing 
an institute for Christian-Muslim dialogue.  Likewise in 
Asia, there will be a meeting in Subic Bay in the Philippines 
between Catholic bishops and Muslim leaders that Fitzgerald 
would attend, and which he expected would generate a healthy 
dialogue. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Archbishop Fitzgerald\'s original comments reflect the 
unfortunate tendency among some Vatican prelates who take on 
board and pass along impressions gleaned from the European 
media without checking their facts or drawing distinctions 
between official U.S. policy and positions of other groups 
and voices within American society.  Following this 
discussion and the extensive information we provided 
Fitzgerald about U.S. outreach to the Muslim world, we expect 
he will be more circumspect in future public pronouncements 
and could be a useful ally in inter-religious initiatives.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
1. (C) In the wake of the UN Headquarters attack, Vatican 
Deputy Foreign Minister Parolin reacted positively to our 
call for support for the Iraqi Governing Council (ref A), and 
said the Holy See would likely be open to talks with its 
representatives.  Parolin expressed interest in securing Holy 
See participation at the upcoming donors\' conference in 
Spain.  Through its nuncio in Iraq, the Vatican has 
emphasized the importance of maintaining the international 
commitment to Iraq\'s reconstruction following the terrorist 
attack.  During his recent return to Rome, the nuncio had 
given the Holy See a generally positive assessment of the 
situation on the ground.  Parolin expressed concern about and 
interest in reports of Iranian meddling in Iraq, and 
indicated he would welcome information from the U.S. on 
Iran\'s activities.  The Holy See maintains an active 
relationship with Iran, and may be willing to weigh in with 
Iran to discourage further involvement.  See ACTION REQUEST 
para. 6.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Vatican Supportive on Reconstruction Efforts 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Holy See Deputy Foreign Minister Pietro Parolin was 
upbeat in conversations on Iraq with the CDA August 20. 
Though saddened by the previous day\'s attack on UN 
Headquarters, Parolin was receptive to our approach (per ref 
A) for support for the Iraqi Governing Council (GC) and the 
reconstruction process in general.  He agreed that the 
coalition and international community had to press forward 
with the reconstruction process.  Parolin foresaw no problem 
in receiving GC representatives to begin talks on issues of 
mutual concern, including the possibility of establishing a 
liaison office to the Holy See, building on the 
infrastructure of Iraq\'s former Vatican diplomatic 
representation. 
 
3. (C) Parolin expressed interest in the Vatican\'s attending 
the October 23-24 donors\' conference in Spain.  Though the 
Holy See itself has limited assistance funds, its affiliated 
charitable institutions such as CARITAS -- which are 
coordinated by the Vatican\'s Council Cor Unum -- have been 
active in Iraq for many years and have a well-developed 
relief and reconstruction infrastructure in the country. 
Moreover, Parolin indicated that the Holy See wanted to 
emphasize its moral support for Iraqi reconstruction.  Per 
ref B, we will inform the Holy See that it should approach 
Spain to coordinate its potential participation in the 
meeting. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Constructive View of Events on the Ground 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The Vatican\'s view of events on the ground in Iraq 
since the end of the war remains constructive and 
surprisingly upbeat.  The Apostolic Nuncio to Iraq, 
Archbishop Fernando Filoni, told Vatican Radio August 21 that 
the attack on UN Headquarters should not deter the 
international community in its commitment to return Iraq to 
normalcy.  Though there are people who \"do not want 
normality,\" the majority of Iraqis do, he commented.  The way 
to achieve this normalcy, Filoni said, is to develop 
international relations \"between Iraq and other countries.\" 
Filoni, in fact, had been in Rome recently on leave and was 
said to be in good spirits.  He told Parolin that while the 
security situation was affecting aid distribution, overall 
conditions in the country were improving.  He believed the 
top priorities must now be the hospitals and security. 
Filoni reported to the Holy See about a recent killing of a 
Christian in Northern Iraq, but said that the Nunciature was 
still investigating the motives behind it to determine 
whether it was religiously motivated. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Chaldean Community Selecting Patriarch 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Parolin told us the Vatican had not been getting much 
news recently from the Chaldean Catholic community in Iraq. 
 
 
However, the Chaldean Synod is in the process of choosing a 
new patriarch for the Church.  The recently deceased 
patriarch, Raphael Bidawid, had been close to Saddam\'s regime 
and quite vocal in opposition to UN sanctions and US policy 
in general; the identity and approach of the new patriarch 
may have an impact on the atmosphere in Iraq and the future 
direction of the Chaldean community.  Parolin did not 
identify any front-runners. 
 
------------------------------ 
Concern About Iranian Meddling 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) In wrapping up our discussion on Iraq, the Deputy 
ForMin asked us to gauge the extent to which Iran may be 
contributing to insecurity and instability in southern Iraq. 
CDA responded that the USG has publicly stated its concerns 
about Iranian meddling and that we have raised those concerns 
with a number of countries.  He pledged to make further 
inquiries about USG concerns about Iran\'s role, which Parolin 
said the Holy See would welcome.  We note that the Holy See 
maintains an active bilateral dialogue with Iran, and we 
believe it would likely be willing to weigh in with Iranian 
authorities to discourage continued involvement in Iraq. 
Please advise if there is information on this issue 
appropriate to pass to the Holy See in order to encourage 
their engagement with Iran to discourage further meddling in 
Iraq.

1. (C)  FRANK DEWANE, UNDER SECRETARY OF THE VATICAN\'S 
    COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE TOLD CHARGE AUGUST 27 THAT THE 
COUNCIL\'S RECENTLY ANNOUNCED BIOTECH CONFERENCE IN NOVEMBER 
WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE SHAPE.  WHILE THE SPECIFICS ARE STILL 
BEING WORKED OUT, DEWANE SAID THAT THE COUNCIL WAS SEEKING TO 
ENSURE THAT THE ROSTER OF SPEAKERS WOULD BE WEIGHTED TOWARD 
BIOTECH ADVOCATES.  DEWANE ALSO NOTED THAT AFTER SOME 
INTERNAL DEBATE, THE COUNCIL WAS NOW LIKELY TO ISSUE A 
DOCUMENT AFTER THE CONFERENCE -- EITHER A STATEMENT OR A 
SUMMARY OF CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS 
DOCUMENT WOULD REPRESENT THE POSITION OF THE JUSTICE AND 
PEACE COUNCIL, BUT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A DEFINITIVE 
\'PAPAL POSITION.\'  DEWANE FURTHER NOTED THAT THE CONFERENCE 
WOULD HAVE A MEDIA COMPONENT AIMED AT DISSEMINATING THE

INVITED TO THE CONFERENCE ITSELF. 
 
2. (C) CHARGE WELCOMED THE PROGRESS IN PLANNING FOR THE 
CONFERENCE AND THE INDICATIONS THAT THE VATICAN WOULD SEEK TO 
EMPHASIZE PRO-BIOTECH VOICES.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE 
HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HOLY SEE\'S PUTTING OUT A 
DEFINITIVE VIEW FOR USE BY BISHOPS AND NUNCIOS WORLDWIDE TO 
HELP SHAPE OPINION, PARTICULARLY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  HE 
POINTED OUT THAT CATHOLIC BISHOPS IN BRAZIL HAD RECENTLY PUT 
OUT A STATEMENT OPPOSING BIOTECH FOODS -- A STATEMENT FULL OF 
THE WORST MISINFORMATION IMAGINABLE, SUCH AS CLAIMS THAT 
BIOTECH FOODS CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTIONS, COULD WIPE OUT 
INDIGENOUS CROPS, AND WOULD THREATEN NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  GIVEN THE RESPECT WITH WHICH THE 
BISHOPS\' VIEWS ARE REGARDED IN MANY COUNTRIES, HE NOTED, IT 
WAS VITAL THAT THE HOLY SEE ENSURE THAT ITS BISHOPS BASED 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON FACTS ON NOT FEARS.  DEWANE ACKNOWLEDGED 
    THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING SO, AND REQUESTED THAT THE EMBASSY 
PASS ALONG ANY ADDITIONAL POINTS THAT WOULD ASSIST THEM IN 
PROVIDING CLEAR AND FACTUAL ANSWERS TO SOME OF THESE CLAIMS,

DEBATE PUBLICLY AND WITHIN THE VATICAN IN ADVANCE OF 
NOVEMBER\'S CONFERENCE.  GIDDINGS\' PLANNED SCHEDULE INCLUDES

Retroviral Program as Model 
 
Refs: A) Vatican 1508 (notal),   B) Vatican 1953 (notal) 
 
-------------------------- 
Summary and Action Request 
-------------------------- 
 
1. (u) The Sant\'Egidio Community\'s ambitious program to 
combat HIV/AIDS in Mozambique (reftels), has met with 
considerable success this past year and is now set for 
expansion in Mozambique and potentially in other affected 
countries.  This track record, and the enthusiastic 
reaction to the program from HHS Secretary Thompson during 
his visit to Rome in April, have prompted Sant\'Egidio to 
think big and to consider putting their anti-retroviral 
treatment forward as a model for implementation elsewhere. 
Sant\'Egidio officials plan to visit Washington in mid- 
September to review with State, HHS, and AID officials 
prospects for funding for Mozambique and for expanded use 
of their Mozambique DREAM program.  Embassy continues to 
strongly support U.S. funding for Sant\'Egidio\'s Mozambique 
DREAM program, and would also support its expansion to 
other countries and use as a model for anti-retroviral 
treatment elsewhere. 
 
2.  ACTION REQUEST:  Sant\'Egidio leaders would like to meet 
with the President\'s recently nominated HIV/AIDS 
Coordinator Randall Tobias and Deputy Joseph O\'Neill during 
their planned September 15-19 visit to Washington.  Embassy 
endorses this request, and recommends that the Department 
support this innovative anti-retroviral program with 
adequate funding to ensure its continued expansion.  End 
Summary and Action Request. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Mozambique DREAM Program Taking Root 
------------------------------------ 
 
3.  Charge and Poloff met with Sant\'Egidio Community leader 
and Embassy liaison Claudio Betti August 27 to review 
Betti\'s planned visit to Washington and the Community\'s 
progress in implementing its DREAM (Drug Resource 
Enhancement against AIDS) anti-retroviral program 
(reftels).  Betti indicated that the program in Mozambique 
is making great strides, aided by commitments from 
pharmaceutical companies and the Italian government to 
produce anti-retroviral drugs at minimal cost.  He said the 
Community was seeking a total of 5 million dollars for this 
year\'s Mozambique program, and had secured some of this 
funding from the World Bank and other sources, but would 
welcome additional support from the United States. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Exploring Potential as a Model Program 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  Betti noted that Sant\'Egidio appreciated the 
enthusiastic reception its HIV/AIDS efforts received from 
HHS Secretary Thompson in Rome and subsequently in their 
meeting with him in Washington.  Based on the comments they 
received from the Secretary and his staff, Sant\'Egidio was 
now examining how their DREAM program could be expanded 
beyond Mozambique and used as a model that could be 
implemented by governments even without direct Sant\'Egidio 
participation. 
 
5.  Betti and HIV/AIDS Program Director Dr. Leonardo 
Palombi are planning to visit Washington in mid-September 
to meet with officials at HHS and at Georgetown 
University\'s School of Medicine to plan for a Washington 
presentation of their program to the international donor 
 
 
and health community later this year or early next year. 
Betti believed such a presentation of the program\'s results 
would provide the best springboard to expanded use of the 
DREAM framework elsewhere. 
 
6.  Betti and Palombi have expressed interest in meeting 
with HIV/AIDS Director Tobias (if confirmed by the time of 
their visit) and with Dr. O\'Neill, with whom Betti and 
other Sant\'Egidio officials had met this spring at the 
White House.  Sant\'Egidio would like to pursue U.S. funding 
from the President\'s HIV/AIDS initiative, but more 
importantly, would like to explore possibilities for 
expanding the DREAM project to other countries and using it 
as a model that could be adopted by governments in affected 
countries.  Betti and Palombi also intend to meet with Bill 
Steiger of HHS, but will coordinate their own arrangements 
directly with HHS.  Embassy believes Sant\'Egidio\'s efforts 
can contribute significantly to the implementation of the 
President\'s International Mother and Child HIV Prevention 
Initiative by increasing the availability of preventive 
care and building healthcare delivery systems to reach as 
many women as possible with the care they need.  Embassy 
would appreciate Department\'s assistance in facilitating 
meetings with the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator.

1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  FRANK DEWANE, UNDER SECRETARY OF THE 
VATICAN\'S COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE, WHO WILL LEAD THE 
    VATICAN\'S DELEGATION TO THE CANCUN WTO MINISTERIAL, TOLD 
CHARGE AUGUST 27 THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD PRESS TO ENSURE THAT 
\"HUMAN DEVELOPMENT\" WOULD BE A CENTRAL PART OF THE DIALOGUE 
IN CANCUN.  IN THE VIEW OF THE HOLY SEE, PROGRESS IN TRADE 
AND DEVELOPMENT MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY ATTENTION TO ITS 
IMPACT ON PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES.  IN THIS CONTEXT, DEWANE 
HAD URGED RAPID RESOLUTION OF THE TRIPS ISSUE TO ENSURE POOR 
COUNTRY ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL MEDICINES, AND A MORE DETERMINED 
EFFORT TO DEAL WITH AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES.  THE VATICAN 
RELEASED SEPTEMBER 3 A STATEMENT TO HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC 
MISSIONS IN PREPARATION FOR THE MINISTERIAL, WHICH CALLED FOR 
A NEW COMMITMENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF THE POOR AND AN 
ALLOWANCE OF GREATER FLEXIBILITY FOR POOR COUNTRIES IN THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADE RULES.  END SUMMARY.

2. (SBU)  FRANK DEWANE, UNDER SECRETARY OF THE VATICAN\'S 
COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE, WHO WILL LEAD THE VATICAN\'S 
DELEGATION TO THE CANCUN WTO MINISTERIAL, TOLD CHARGE AND 
POLOFF AUGUST 27 THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD PRESS TO ENSURE THAT 
\"HUMAN DEVELOPMENT\" WOULD BE KEPT IN SHARP FOCUS IN CANCUN. 
WHILE THE VATICAN DOES NOT INTEND TO GET INTO THE WEEDS IN 
TECHNICAL MATTERS, IT FEELS IT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN 
PROVIDING \"ETHICAL GUIDELINES\" FOR TRADE AGREEMENTS.  AS THE 
HOLY SEE STATEMENT FOR CANCUN (FULL TEXT FAXED TO EUR/WE) 
NOTES, \"TRADE SHOULD BENEFIT PEOPLE, NOT JUST MARKETS AND 
ECONOMIES.\"  IN THIS REGARD, THE VATICAN PLANS TO CALL 
ATTENTION TO THE EFFECTS OF TRADE REGULATIONS ON PEOPLE, 
    PARTICULARLY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  ACCORDING TO THE 
VATICAN STATEMENT, PRESENT AGREEMENTS HAVE OFTEN NEGLECTED 
THESE CONCERNS. 
 
------------------------- 
ONE SIZE DOESN\'T FIT ALL 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  IN THE CANCUN PREPARATORY DOCUMENT, THE HOLY SEE 
CALLS FOR THE WTO TO TAKE BETTER STOCK, ON A 
COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS, OF HOW TRADE REGULATIONS ARE 
AFFECTING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT -- IN PARTICULAR THE ABILITY OF 
COUNTRIES TO DEAL WITH POVERTY AND SOCIAL ISSUES SUCH AS 
ACCESS TO FOOD, WATER, AND EDUCATION AS THEY IMPLEMENT WTO 
AGREEMENTS.  THE DOCUMENT WARNS AGAINST A \"ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL\" 
APPROACH TO TRADE REGULATIONS WHEN DEALING WITH DEVELOPING 
NATIONS.  AS DEWANE SAID, WTO RULES SHOULD BE BIASED IN FAVOR 
OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF POORER NATIONS, AND ALLOW FOR 
FLEXIBILITY IN POLICY-MAKING BY THEIR GOVERNMENTS.

----- 
 
4.  (SBU) MEETING WITH US JUST PRIOR TO THE RESOLUTION OF THE 
ACCESS TO MEDICINE ISSUES OF THE AGREEMENT ON TRADE-RELATED 
ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (TRIPS), DEWANE 
EMPHASIZED THAT THE VATICAN RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF 
PROPERTY RIGHTS, HAVING ITSELF HELD PROPERTY FOR CENTURIES. 
BUT HE EXPLAINED THAT THE HOLY SEE SEES A KIND OF COMMONLY 
HELD \"SOCIAL MORTGAGE\" ON SUCH PROPERTY THAT DEMANDS THAT 
    CONCESSIONS BE MADE TO THE COMMON GOOD.  CONCRETELY, THE 
VATICAN\'S CANCUN STATEMENT SAYS THERE IS AN \"OBLIGATION OF 
THE RICHER COUNTRIES TO TACKLE AND REMEDY AND SHORTCOMINGS 
AND LESS FAVORABLE CONDITIONS OF POOR COUNTRIES AS IF THEY 
WERE INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF THEIR OWN.\" 
 
5.  (SBU)  CHARGE NOTED THE USG\'S COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS THE 
PROBLEMS OF THOSE COUNTRIES MOST IN NEED AND SPECIFICALLY OUR 
DETERMINATION TO ACHIEVE A RESOLUTION OF THE TRIPS ISSUE THAT 
REFLECTED THE SHARED U.S. AND HOLY SEE DESIRE TO OFFER 
LIFE-SAVING MEDICINES TO THE MOST NEEDY.  CHARGE EMPHASIZED 
THAT WE HAD TO STRIKE A BALANCE THAT WOULD PROVIDE DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES THE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE DRUGS FOR HEALTH EMERGENCIES 
FROM THIRD COUNTRIES WHILE STILL GUARDING AGAINST ABUSE OF 
THE PATENTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT COULD UNDERMINE 
FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  DEWANE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
THE BALANCING ACT BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND 
ACCESS WAS A DIFFICULT ONE, BUT EMPHASIZED THAT FOR THE HOLY 
SEE, PRIORITY MUST BE GIVEN TO THE NEEDS OF THE MOST 
VULNERABLE.  FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESOLUTION OF 
THE ISSUE, THE HOLY SEE\'S ACTING FM CONVEYED TO CHARGE THE 
HOLY SEE\'S SATISFACTION WITH THE OUTCOME. 
 
 
NOTE: NOT PASSED TO ABOVE ADDRESSEE(S) 
 
VATICAN 00004002  002 OF 002 
 
THAN EUROPE ON THE AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES ISSUE.  WHILE HE 
INDICATED THAT LAST YEAR\'S CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS ON DOMESTIC 
SUBSIDIES HAD GENERATED SKEPTICISM IN MANY QUARTERS ABOUT THE 
    U.S. COMMITMENT TO REDUCING AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES, DEWANE 
NEVERTHELESS THOUGHT THE EU (AND FRANCE IN PARTICULAR) WOULD 
HAVE \"A LOT MORE TO ANSWER FOR\" IN CANCUN.  THE HOLY SEE\'S 
FOCUS IN CANCUN WILL BE THE NEED FOR REFORMS IN MARKET ACCESS 
FOR PRODUCTS OF POORER COUNTRIES, WHICH THE VATICAN STRESSED 
\"CANNOT BE PUT ASIDE INDEFINITELY.\"  CHARGE EMPHASIZED THAT 
THE U.S. WAS COMMITTED TO REDUCING AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES, 
BUT WOULD NEED MOVEMENT FROM THE EU TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. 
---------------------------- 
COMMENT: FROM DOHA TO CANCUN 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C)  THE HOLY SEE HAS WELCOMED THE PROGRESS MADE IN DOHA 
TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF POORER COUNTRIES AND THEIR PEOPLE, 
BUT WARNS THAT DOHA CAN ONLY BE A STARTING POINT IN A PROCESS 
LEADING TO THE FULL INTEGRATION OF POOR COUNTRIES TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM.  IN THIS REGARD, THE HOLY SEE 
WILL LIKELY SUPPORT CAPACITY-BUILDING EFFORTS, MARKET ACCESS 
INITIATIVES WITHOUT INSISTENCE ON RECIPROCITY, AND 
FLEXIBILITY IN IMPLEMENTING TRADE RULES.  THEY BELIEVE THAT 
ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DOHA MANDATE TO GIVE SPECIAL ATTENTION TO 
THE NEEDS OF THE POOR CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY DECISIONS OF 
THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, \"WHICH MUST ASSUME THEIR PARTICULAR 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE UNIVERSAL COMMON GOOD.\"

CURED\" 
 
 
1. (U) THE HOLY SEE HAS REEMPHASIZED THE NEED TO UPROOT 
DISCRIMINATION AND ANTI-SEMITISM IN A NEW DOCUMENT MARKING 
THE CELEBRATION OF JEWISH CULTURE IN EUROPE.  ISSUED BY 
GERMAN-BORN CARDINAL WALTER KASPER, THE HEAD OF THE VATICAN 
    OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM, THE PAPER 
REITERATES RECENT VATICAN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE ROLE 
CHRISTIANS PLAYED IN FOMENTING THE ANTI-SEMITIC SENTIMENT 
THAT CULMINATED IN \"THE HORRENDOUS SLAUGHTER OF THE SHOAH.\" 
 
2. (U) IN THE NEW DOCUMENT, KASPER AFFIRMED THAT ERRONEOUS 
INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE RESULTED IN ANTI-SEMITIC 
DISCRIMINATION, PARTICULARLY IN CHRISTIAN EUROPE, AND THAT 
THIS BECAME MORE PREVALENT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN 
IT ASSUMED A \"SOCIOPOLITICAL\" RATHER THAN A RELIGIOUS 
CHARACTER.  THE CARDINAL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT CHRISTIANS DID 
NOT ADEQUATELY OPPOSE THE IDEOLOGICAL PREMISES THAT 
RESULTED IN THE SHOAH AND POINTS OUT THAT \"INFLUENTIAL\" 
CATHOLIC JOURNALS PUBLISHED ANTI-SEMITIC ARTICLES.  KASPER 
QUOTES FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S 1998 DOCUMENT ON THE SHOAH THAT 
THE CHRISTIAN RESPONSE, \"WAS NOT WHAT ONE WOULD HAVE 
EXPECTED FROM THE DISCIPLES OF CHRIST.\" 
 
3. (U) FOR KASPER, THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE FOR THE HOLY 
SEE TO THIS LEGACY IS \"A PENITENTIAL PROCESS\" -- EXEMPLARY 
AND CONCRETE ACTIONS THAT SHOW THAT PRESENT MEMBERS OF THE 
CHURCH SHARE IN THE SINS OF THE PAST.  HE POINTS OUT THAT 
PENITENTIAL GESTURES AND LAUDABLE OFFICIAL STATEMENTS FROM 
THE POPE AND THE HOLY SEE MUST BE MATCHED AT THE GRASS- 
ROOTS LEVEL.  KASPER CALLS FOR A RELIGIOUS DIMENSION TO 
COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM THAT GOES BEYOND THE CULTURAL, SOCIAL, 
POLITICAL OR IDEOLOGICAL LEVEL, AND PLACES CHRISTIANS AND 
JEWS ON AN EQUAL PLAIN AS THE \"CHOSEN PEOPLE.\"  IN DOING 
SO, KASPER IS ESSENTIALLY REWRITING A 1928 HOLY SEE 
STATEMENT THAT REPUDIATED DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE \"AT 
ONE TIME CHOSEN PEOPLE.\"  INSTEAD, KASPER ASSERTS THAT 
    JUDAISM\'S STATUS AS A CHOSEN PEOPLE MEANS CHRISTIANS AND 
JEWS ARE BOUND IN A FORM OF IRREVOCABLE ALLIANCE THAT CALLS 
BOTH TO A UNIVERSAL VOCATION TO SERVE HUMANITY IN PEACE AND 
JUSTICE.  KASPER BASES FUTURE RELATIONS BETWEEN JEWS AND 
CHRISTIANS ON THE HONEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE ROLE 
CHRISTIANS PLAYED IN THE ORIGIN AND DIFFUSION OF ANTI- 
SEMITIC ATTITUDES. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT: CARDINAL KASPER IS THE DRIVING FORCE 
BEHIND THE HOLY SEE\'S RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM AND HIS GERMAN 
ORIGIN MAKES HIM A SENSITIVE INTERLOCUTOR ON ANTI-SEMITISM 
ISSUES.  HIS PAPER, PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 8 IN THE VATICAN\'S 
SEMI-OFFICIAL DAILY, L\'OSSERVATORE ROMANO, INDICATES THAT 
EFFORTS TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM, INCLUDING BY ACKNOWLEDGING 
CHRISTIAN COMPLICITY IN SHAPING NEGATIVE EUROPEAN ATTITUDES 
TOWARDS JUDAISM REMAIN HIGH ON THE HOLY SEE\'S AGENDA AND 
ARE STILL A KEY THEME OF JOHN PAUL II\'S PAPACY.  WHILE 
HIGH-LEVEL STATEMENTS AND SYMBOLIC GESTURES HAVE PROVIDED A 
CLEAR PUBLIC INDICATION OF THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION ON ANTI- 
SEMITISM AND HAVE REAFFIRMED GUIDELINES FOR THE FAITHFUL, 
THE VATICAN RECOGNIZES THAT THESE NEED TO BE TRANSFORMED 
INTO ACTION AMONG THE WIDER CHURCH MEMBERSHIP.  WHILE THERE 
HAVE BEEN SOME EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES, UNIVERSITY COURSES 
ENCOMPASSING CHRISTIAN-JEWISH ISSUES, AND AN ARRAY OF 
INTER-RELIGIOUS DISCUSSIONS, KASPER UNDERSTANDS THAT MORE 
SIMILAR INITIATIVES FROM CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN EUROPE 
WILL BE NEEDED TO OVERCOME THE PLAGUE OF ANTI-SEMITISM. 
END COMMENT.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Holy See Deputy Foreign Minister Parolin told Embassy 
September 11 that the Papal Nuncio in Baghdad believed the 
continued lack of \"basic necessities\" amongst the general 
population was generating an increasingly hostile reaction 
towards coalition forces.  Parolin welcomed U.S. efforts to 
broaden the international community\'s activity in Iraq, and 
noted the crucial role the Holy See feels moderate Arab 
countries could play in the reconstruction process.  The Holy 
See is continuing its efforts to expand its dialogue with the 
Islamic world, engaging moderate Muslim groups that it hopes 
can counterbalance more radical influences.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Lack of Necessities Provoking Ire of Iraqis 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) DCM and EUR/WE Deputy Director Hernandez met September 
11 with Holy See Deputy Foreign Minister Pietro Parolin and 
US Affairs Office Director Paolo Gualtieri as part of 
Hernandez\'s orientation trip to the Holy See.  Asked what the 
Holy See was hearing from its Nuncio in Baghdad, Parolin said 
the Nuncio was increasingly concerned by the continuing lack 
of \"basic necessities\" in Iraq, which he believed was 
provoking a hostile reaction from Iraqis towards coalition 
forces.  Shortages of water, electricity, some foodstuffs, 
and medical services, combined with a continuing sense of 
insecurity, were leading to bubbling discontent, which people 
then blamed on the American forces.  DCM responded that the 
U.S. was working flat out to restore and in many cases 
improve basic services, but that sabotage and the poor state 
of the preexisting infrastructure had hindered this effort. 
Noting that the President had just requested an additional 87 
billion dollars for Iraqi reconstruction, he emphasized that 
the U.S. was determined to address the problems, but needed 
the full support of the international community. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
UNSCR / More International Cooperation the \"Right Idea.\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
3. (C) Turning to efforts in New York to secure a new UN 
Security Council Resolution and increased international 
participation in Iraq, Parolin said the U.S. had the \"right 
idea.\"  The Holy See would like to see broad international 
oversight and cooperation, but with Iraqis in the lead on 
reconstruction efforts as much as possible.  Parolin said he 
understood the US wanted to maintain its leadership role in 
Iraq, but urged the US to continue efforts to \"find unity\" 
and further cooperation in the international community.  DCM 
pointed out that the U.S. goal is to turn as much authority 
as possible to the Iraqi people as soon as possible, but that 
this had to be done in a way which would ensure stability and 
security in Iraq. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Engagement with the Islamic World 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The Deputy Foreign Minister also stressed the 
importance of deepening the  involvement of \"moderate Arab 
countries\" in Iraqi reconstruction and security efforts.  The 
Holy See regards these countries as an indispensable resource 
in the effort to stabilize Iraq.  For its part, the Vatican 
continues to look for any and every opportunity for dialogue 
with willing interlocutors from the Islamic world.  Dialogue 
\"is the only way,\" Parolin said.  He explained that the Holy 
See was trying to work with moderate Islamic elements in the 
hopes that they might convince their more radical 
coreligionists to adopt a more moderate and peaceful 
interpretation of Islam.  Parolin pointed out that the 
non-hierarchical structure of Islam made it difficult to find 
interlocutors who were willing to talk and would have an 
impact on others.  But he said the Vatican had had some 
success in such dialogue, pointing to efforts in Indonesia as 
an example. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
COMMENT: Holy See Staying Engaged with Islam 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
5. (C)  The Vatican has a keen interest in the well-being of 
Iraq\'s Christian (mostly Chaldean Catholic) population, which 
makes up approximately 2 percent of Iraq\'s population. 
Parolin reiterated the Vatican\'s fears that the establishment 
of a hard-line Islamic government in Iraq could lead to 
repression of Iraq\'s Christians (ref a, b).  This particular 
interest, however, is only a part of the Vatican\'s broader 
interest in dialogue with the Arab world to overcome 
religious intolerance.  For example, ref c noted the 
potential for Vatican engagement with Iran -- with whom it 
maintains an active diplomatic dialogue -- to temper its 
interference in Iraq.  Likewise, the Vatican-sanctioned 
Catholic NGO Sant\' Egidio is also continuing its efforts to 
promote Christian-Muslim dialogue (septel).  In Iraq and 
elsewhere, we can continue to count on the Holy See as a 
useful ally in promoting moderation, tolerance, and 
understanding.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) At Vatican-sanctioned NGO Sant\'Egidio\'s annual 
conference on peace and interreligious dialogue September 7-9 
in Aachen, Germany, religious and civic leaders from around 
the world discussed and debated global and regional issues in 
which religious groups are involved and could be part of a 
solution.  In a spirited session on Iraq, an Iraqi Shiite 
theologian praised the US-led coalition for its defeat of 
Saddam and chided France and Germany for their pacifist 
views, while a Catholic bishop from Baghdad condemned the 
\"dictatorship of chaos\" he said had replaced Saddam\'s regime. 
 The highest level meeting in years between Catholic and 
Russian Orthodox representatives generated modest hopes for a 
thaw in relations between those two churches that could 
contribute to European unity.  A session on the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict generated more heat than light, 
though it offered an occasion for Israelis and Palestinians 
to sit at the same dais.   Sant\'Egidio Community 
representatives highlighted the growing success of the 
community\'s AIDS treatment project in Africa.  Sant\'Egidio\'s 
ability to create and cultivate contacts from varied groups 
and bring friends and adversaries to the table to talk -- 
demonstrated throughout the conference -- makes it an 
important USG partner in conflict resolution and in promoting 
inter-religious understanding and tolerance.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Conference Draws Religious, Civic Leaders 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The lay Catholic Sant\'Egidio Community, best known 
for its role in brokering an end to the Mozambican civil war 
in 1992, is now active in over 60 countries, conducting 
widespread programs to aid the poor and elderly, combat 
HIV/AIDS, and promote inter-religious dialogue and conflict 
resolution.  Since 1987, the Community has hosted yearly 
conferences of religious and other leaders aimed at promoting 
peace and interreligious dialogue in the spirit of Pope John 
Paul II\'s 1986 World Day of Prayer and Peace in Assisi, 
Italy.  That event, which brought together world religious 
leaders to promote the resolution of conflicts, was organized 
in part by Sant\'Egidio and represented a major step in 
interreligious dialogue, as well as a bold departure for the 
Pope, who was criticized at the time by many co-religionists 
for appearing to promote religious syncretism.  Since then, 
Sant\'Egidio has used the Pope\'s initiative as a mandate to 
continue religious dialogue for peace. 
 
3. (U) Among the 500 participants from some 70 countries at 
this year\'s conference were Cardinal Roger Etchegary, the 
Pope\'s \"trouble-shooting\" Cardinal who was sent to see Saddam 
Hussein on the eve of the Iraq war, Russian Orthodox 
Metropolitan Kyrill, Chief Rabbi of Israel Meir Lau, and 
Turkish Minister of State Mehmet Aydin.  In addition to key 
themes of Iraq, Middle East, Christian-Orthodox relations, 
and HIV/AIDS, the conference focused on the situation in Cote 
d\'Ivoire, Muslim-Christian relations, and developments in 
Asia and Latin America.  Prepared remarks for some sessions 
can be found on the Sant\'Egidio website, www.santegidio.org. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
In Emotional Session on Iraq, Iraqi Shiite Praises Coalition 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
4. (U) Media and audience members jammed every nook of an 
upstairs conference room for a session on \"Iraq within War 
and Peace.\"  Iraqi Shiite Sayed Aiad Jamal Aldin shocked the 
decidedly pacifist crowd by insisting that there were far 
worse things than war -- like living under Saddam\'s brutal 
dictatorship.  He thanked the coalition for all it had done 
for his people and had harsh words for \"the Europeans,\" 
saying that if it had been up to them, the Iraqis would still 
be suffering under the previous regime.  It was easy for 
 
France and Germany \"to talk about peace,\" he said, but they 
didn\'t have to live under Saddam.  Aldin said the US was in 
Iraq with the support of the Iraqi people and any resistance 
was not reflective of the will of the Iraqis.  Jamal Aldin 
noted the need to make Iraqi borders more secure, saying that 
Iraqis were paying the price as \"foreigners\" were crossing 
the border in large numbers to destabilize the country.  When 
asked about the current situation in Iraq, Jamal Aldin 
insisted that much of the damage one sees today had been 
inflicted on the country before the war under Saddam.  He 
encouraged greater international cooperation in Iraq, and 
said Germany and France should help with reconstruction but 
\"should not interfere with the government.\" 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
Chaldean Bishop Laments Iraq Chaos 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Shlemon Warduni, a Chaldean Catholic Bishop in 
Baghdad, had a less sanguine view of the situation. 
Describing in emotional detail the devastation and loss of 
life that occurred during the war, he charged that Saddam\'s 
dictatorship had merely given way to a \"dictatorship of 
chaos.\"  Warduni detailed a lack of medical care in Iraq, 
security concerns, and, above all, what he described as a 
deep fear on the part of the people.  \"We cry, but no one 
hears us,\" the bishop said, adding that he was thankful to be 
in Aachen for a few days, if only to enjoy some respite from 
violence and to be able to fall asleep \"without hearing 
gunfire.\"  Warduni\'s comments were not a surprise to those 
aware of the Chaldean Church\'s pre-war criticism of U.S. 
policies and its close relationship with the previous regime. 
 But his message struck a chord with the audience, who gave 
the bishop a warm ovation after his presentation. 
 
--------------------- 
A Chance for Dialogue 
--------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Though Jamal Aldin\'s and Warduni\'s words appeared to 
offer little common ground, Iraqi Sunnite leader Ahmed M. 
Mohammed, offered an opening for dialogue.  He emphasized a 
general desire for coexistence and discussion, and noted the 
need for mutual trust between people of different faiths. 
Mohammed seemed anxious to turn the page on the war and on 
the years of dictatorship, and to focus on the necessity of 
many peoples \"living together in Iraq.\"  The session 
highlighted the range of perspectives existing among Iraqis 
about the war and its aftermath.  Symbolically, at least, the 
conference brought these perspectives together when the two 
Muslims joined with Catholic Bishop Warduni to light the 
\"peace candle\" at the conference\'s closing ceremonies, 
creating a powerful image of reconciliation. 
 
--------------------------- 
Treating HIV/AIDS in Africa 
--------------------------- 
 
7. (U) In a session on Africa, AF PDAS Charles Snyder 
outlined the scope and implications of the HIV/AIDS crisis, 
emphasizing the links between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and 
security, democracy, and poverty.  Snyder also noted that 
HIV/AIDS could exacerbate societal ills such as prostitution, 
child trafficking and other scourges as more and more 
children are raised without parents.  Armed conflict, he 
pointed out, also fuels the epidemic by contributing to the 
sexual abuse of women, destruction of a country\'s health 
infrastructure, and the exhaustion of funds that could 
otherwise be spent on health care.  Snyder noted the USG\'s 
role as a leading contributor in the fight against AIDS, 
highlighting the President\'s new HIV/AIDS initiative, our 
contributions to the Global Fund, and a series of bilateral 
initiatives and assistance to affected countries encompassing 
education, prevention, and treatment. 
 
-------------------------------- 
DREAM HIV/AIDS Treatment Program 
-------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Sant\'Egidio\'s leaders emphasized that its own HIV/AIDS 
program (DREAM - Drug Resource Enhancement against AIDS in 
Mozambique), demonstrated that, contrary to the naysayers, it 
is possible to treat AIDS in Africa, rather than rely solely 
 
on prevention programs (ref a,b,c).  Relying on prevention, 
according to St. Egidio\'s Germano, \"is effectively a death 
sentence\" for those already infected.  Instead, Sant\'Egidio 
combines prevention initiatives with DREAM\'s free 
anti-retroviral program, currently treating some 2000 
patients.  \"Why shouldn\'t Africans have access to the same 
quality AIDS treatment programs one finds in Western Europe,\" 
Germano asked.  She said that Mozambicans had proven false 
assertions that Africans wouldn\'t have the tenacity, 
understanding or sense of time to effectively follow an 
anti-retroviral regimen.  The next step, Germano said, was to 
expand the program to other countries, something Sant\'Egidio 
has already begun in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Tanzania, and 
intends to explore with State and HHS officials and at 
Georgetown University. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Thawing Russian Orthodox-Catholic Relations 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) One of the most significant developments at the 
conference came on the margins with a two-hour breakfast 
meeting between Cardinal Walter Kasper, the Holy See\'s top 
man for ecumenical dialogue, and Russian Orthodox 
Metropolitan Kyrill, number two in the Russian Orthodox 
Church behind ailing Patriarch Alexi.  The one-on-one session 
away from the public eye -- the highest level contact between 
the Holy See and the Orthodox Church -- appears to have eased 
previous personal tensions between the two leaders.  Their 
public dialogue, however, traded traditional complaints, with 
Kyril accusing the Holy See of proselytizing while Kasper 
insisted that there was no \"Vatican-sponsored movement\" 
responsible for any post-communist draining of adherents from 
the Orthodox Churches.  Both Kasper and Kyrill nevertheless 
made some positive public comments on relations and indicated 
that over the long term they expected relations to improve 
(ref d). 
 
10. (C) Improvements in Orthodox-Catholic relations have 
broad implications, not just for Christian ecumenism, but for 
East-West relations in Europe.  Reconciliation between the 
Catholic and Orthodox Churches would give added meaning and 
potential political significance to the Pope\'s continued 
emphasis in recent months on the common Christian roots of 
Europe.  Closer ties between the Russian Orthodox church and 
the West would also have implications for relations between 
Christianity and the Muslim world. 
 
--------------------------- 
Israel-Palestinian Dialogue 
--------------------------- 
 
11. (U) Oded Ben-Hur, the Ambassador of Israel to the Holy 
See, Fr. Elias Chacour, Director of the Prophet Elias 
College, Israel, and David Rosen, President of the American 
Jewish Committee, provided constructive give-and-take on the 
common desire for peace in a session on the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Chacour, a Catholic priest 
active in regional inter-faith programs, criticized Israeli 
strategy in the conflict and the support of the religious 
right in the U.S., whose single-minded support of Israel, he 
claimed, was helping no one in the region.  Unfortunately, 
some in the audience soured the atmosphere of the session by 
interrupting speakers and making provocative remarks. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Comment: Sant Egidio a Valuable Partner 
--------------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) Sant\'Egidio has proven a valuable partner for the 
U.S. on a range of issues, encompassing conflict resolution 
in Mozambique, Liberia, Sudan, and the Great Lakes, to its 
current effort to treat AIDS in Africa.  The group\'s focus, 
however, is not limited to Africa, as the Aachen conference 
demonstrated.  Sant\'Egidio\'s is effective in creating and 
cultivating high-level contacts from diverse and often 
antagonistic groups and then promoting political and 
religious dialogue.  When it comes to conflict resolution, 
Sant\' Egidio benefits from being able to engage rebel groups 
that governments need to approach with more caution.  It 
works adeptly with those from different ethnic groups and 
religions and seems to gain their trust rapidly.  \"They know 
we have only one interest - peace,\" says Sant\'Egidio Director 
of International Cooperation Claudio Betti.  Of course, the 
 
group\'s informal approach and strategies may sometimes need 
supervision.  AF PDAS Snyder notes that during the Liberia 
negotiations the USG had to contact Sant\'Egidio once or twice 
to better coordinate their efforts with U.S. engagement. 
Likewise, in regard to Uganda, Snyder said, AF needed to look 
more closely at whom Sant\' Egidio was talking to on the rebel 
side to see if such engagement would be helpful.  With proper 
cooperation and communication, which Sant\'Egidio welcomes and 
has pursued in recent meetings in the Department, we believe 
expanded linkages with the Sant\'Egidio community can benefit 
U.S. efforts to resolve conflicts, combat HIV/AIDS, and 
promote religious tolerance.  We note that on the heels of 
the Aachen conference, Sant\'Egidio\'s Claudio Betti traveled 
to the U.S. September 16-19 (ref a) to review with State, 
HHS, and AID officials prospects for funding for the DREAM 
program, and its expansion, while also engaging various 
Department offices to discuss human rights, religious 
freedom, and Sant\'Egidio\'s potential role in key conflict 
areas.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Frank Dewane, Head of the Holy See\'s delegation to the 
Cancun WTO ministerial believes the U.S. missed an 
opportunity at Cancun to look good in the eyes of the 
developing world.  It did so, in his opinion, by sticking 
with the EU for too long.  He told DCM September 19 that the 
EU had a bad strategy going in, and that their strategy 
backfired.  Dewane lamented that the development and 
agricultural focus appeared to have fallen out at Cancun, as 
everybody became fixated on some big trees, but lost sight of 
the forest.  Looking ahead, Dewane believes the Doha round 
can be salvaged, though not on the current timetable.  He 
suggested that more work needs to be done in Geneva, and 
wondered why more progress had not been made at Geneva to lay 
a better foundation for the ministerial -- which was clearly 
becoming more unwieldy.  The Holy See accepts the U.S. view 
that all countries -- including developing countries -- need 
to scale back protectionist measures, but the Vatican 
nevertheless wants developed countries to demonstrate 
flexibility to allow for special cases for sensitive sectors 
in developing countries.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
U.S: A Missed Chance to Look Good 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) From their perspective as an observer at the recently 
concluded Cancun ministerial, the Holy See believes the U.S. 
\"missed a chance to look good\" in the eyes of the developing 
world.  Monsignor Frank Dewane, Undersecretary of the Council 
for Justice and Peace, who led the Vatican\'s delegation at 
Cancun, told the DCM that he was surprised the U.S. stuck 
with the EU for so long.  \"It was clear to me going in,\" he 
said, \"that the U.S. was going to do better by the developing 
world on agriculture.\"  \"That\'s why I couldn\'t understand why 
you stuck with the EU for so long,\" he added.  Dewane noted 
that some suggested the U.S. -- for domestic reasons -- did 
not really want an agreement to cut subsidies, and was thus 
content to let the EU take the heat.  The DCM affirmed the 
U.S. commitment to reducing agricultural subsidies in 
coordination with a global reduction, but observed that 
developing countries had failed to move beyond rhetoric to 
explore the extent of U.S. flexibility. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Developing Countries: A Missed Chance to Make Progress 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3. (C) Dewane agreed that the developing world had also 
missed a chance to make real progress on its agenda.  Because 
of all the set speeches, he commented, \"the conference never 
got beyond stating positions.\"  He likened the approach of 
many developing countries to \"an adolescent who suddenly 
realizes he\'s cool and he\'s being noticed.\"  This new 
sensation, he believed, would from here on out alter the 
character of WTO talks, as developing countries band together 
in a series of larger and smaller regional groups.  Even 
though at Cancun this strategy had not gained them anything 
but status, he felt that developing country groups would 
become an increasingly important feature of future talks.  He 
observed that the success of the developing groups in staying 
together had been one of the big surprises of the meeting, 
though, given the buildup and expectations at Doha, it should 
not have taken the developed countries by surprise. 
 
---------------- 
EU: Bad Strategy 
---------------- 
 
4. (C) Dewane was sharply critical of the EU\'s strategy at 
Cancun.  \"The EU had a bad strategy going in, and the 
strategy backfired.\"  By not demonstrating their flexibility 
on the Singapore issues earlier, he elaborated, but holding 
out and then accepting what had been on the table two days 
earlier, the EU gave the impression of insincerity -- that 
they were just toying with the developing countries.  By the 
time they accepted it, it was too late to complete the 
agenda, and the Chairman decided to close the meeting -- a 
decision Dewane said he did not fully understand.  At the end 
of the day, Dewane said he was still unsure what the EU was 
hoping to achieve with its focus on the Singapore issues at a 
time when the rest of the world was expecting a greater focus 
on agriculture and other issues more important to the 
 
 
developing countries. 
 
------------------------------------- 
WTO Process:  Too Rushed, Too Diffuse 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Because of tactical decisions on the part of some 
members and a lack of adequate preparation in Geneva, Dewane 
felt the Cancun meeting was \"too rushed and too forced.\"  He 
believed that more issues should have been decided in Geneva; 
otherwise the order was too tall for a ministerial meeting 
with so many participants to reach agreement.  Dewane 
suggested that the Conference also failed in losing sight of 
its primary objective of addressing development issues -- 
particularly agriculture.  \"We lost sight of the forest 
(development) and became fixated on some trees -- big trees, 
but trees nonetheless.\"  Among the trees he cited was the 
African cotton issue.  According to Dewane, cotton became the 
\"belle of the ball\" -- the issue that everyone was talking 
about and which ended up consuming a disproportionate amount 
of time.  Dewane regretted that an agreement on this issue 
was not reached, and said he believed a bit more flexibility 
on the U.S. side on this issue would have sent a positive 
signal to the developing world that could have muted some of 
their disappointment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Road Ahead:  To Geneva With Priority to the Poorest 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
6. (C)  Looking ahead, Dewane believes the WTO should be able 
to achieve agreement on the Doha Round, but not on the 
current schedule.  He did not regard any of the issues as 
insurmountable, though he worried that some of the 
flexibility that countries might have been prepared to show 
at Cancun could now be lost.  He now sees the talks returning 
to Geneva, where he hopes progress can be achieved.  But he 
also recognized that the U.S. and others were likely to 
pursue bilateral and regional trade pacts in the absence of 
progress within the WTO.  The Holy See would continue to 
advocate for greater attention to the problems of the poorest 
of the poor, in particular urging greater flexibility toward 
the poor in implementation of lower tariffs and trade 
barriers.  Dewane said the Holy See agreed that developing 
countries needed to \"avoid the temptation of protectionism\" 
and lower their barriers -- and that it was in their own 
interest to do so -- but he also called for a \"balancing 
mechanism\" that would allow for exceptions in cases where 
small farmers or the preservation of common goods such as 
natural and human environments are at risk.  For the WTO to 
show its human face, he concluded, the Holy See would support 
development of country-by-country assessments of how various 
WTO agreements are likely to affect development policies of 
poorer countries. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) As an observer at the Cancun WTO talks, the Holy See 
is in the unique position of being involved in the 
discussions without having to defend parochial trade 
interests.  As a result, their representatives were able to 
sit back and take in the Cancun meeting with a layer of 
detachment.  Overall, Dewane said the Holy See did not have 
any serious criticism of the U.S. approach, except that we 
had stuck with the EU for too long and missed an opportunity 
to emphasize our desire to reduce agricultural subsidies.  He 
acknowledged that the U.S. and EU had been placed in a 
\"damned if you do, damned if you don\'t\" position in reaching 
a pre-Cancun framework agreement.  After urging such an 
accommodation on the U.S. and EU, Dewane noted, many 
developing countries failed to understand that the agreement 
represented a point of departure and not a take it or leave 
it final proposal.  Dewane remained perplexed by the EU\'s 
position, saying it was never clear to him what the EU was 
trying to achieve.  In the end, he believed they thwarted 
progress on agriculture by diverting attention to the 
Singapore issues, frustrating the developing world in the 
process, and then showing flexibility too late to make a 
difference.  For the long term, the Holy See expects that 
Cancun will stimulate the formation of more developing 
country groups that could, if not better focused and 
prepared, make progress more difficult in the WTO setting -- 
a development that would not be in the developing countries\' 
own interests in a rules-based system.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Pope John Paul II\'s nomination of 31 new cardinals 
September 28 consolidates the group that will name his 
successor, reinforces Church leaders facing threats from 
Islam or restrictive regimes, and rewards several long- 
serving bishops for their service to the Church.  The 
surprise announcement -- following repeated curial denials 
that a consistory would be held during the celebrations of 
the 25th anniversary of John Paul II\'s pontificate -- may 
have also reflected a sense of urgency due to the pontiff\'s 
recent failing health.  While some names were expected -- 
heads of Vatican departments or leaders of major 
archdioceses around the world -- others reflected the 
pope\'s geopolitical focus on Islam, Africa and the Church\'s 
experience of persecution.  With the creation of this new 
group of cardinals, John Paul II will have created 130 of 
the 135 cardinals under the age of 80 and hence eligible to 
vote for the next pope when the time comes -- provided they 
have not reached their 80th birthday by then.  While John 
Paul\'s previous appointments had already molded the group 
according to his ideological vision, the infusion of these 
31 new cardinals will further ensure the election of a 
like-minded successor.  End Summary.

Foreign Minister \"en rouge\" 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Vatican Foreign Minister, French-born Archbishop 
Jean-Louis Tauran, was one of seven Curia officials to be 
nominated a cardinal.  Tauran, 60, suffers from Parkinson\'s 
disease and his retirement from the FM position has been 
the subject of recent speculation.  Tauran\'s resignation 
will take effect October 22 when he is expected to take up 
a less demanding curial position -- potentially as head of 
the Vatican library and archives.  Possible contenders for 
the FM post include Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, an 
expert on China and Vietnam, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, 
Nuncio to Germany, Archbishop Luigi Ventura, Nuncio to 
Canada, and Archbishop Nikola Eterovic, Nuncio in Ukraine. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Reinforcing the Church Under Threat 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Among the 31 newly nominated cardinals was the 
Archbishop of Khartoum, Gabriel Zubier Wako.  The choice of 
Wako in Khartoum --- a post not traditionally filled by a 
Cardinal -- demonstrates the importance the Holy See places 
on the Church\'s status in Sudan where it has been under 
pressure from Sudan\'s Islamicist government.  Elevating 
Wako is also a strong affirmation of Sudan\'s Catholics, who 
have suffered three decades of difficulty in a powerful 
Islamic milieu.  Likewise, Ho Chi Minh City\'s archbishop, 
Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man, receives his red hat for 
analogous reasons -- affirmation for a community pitted 
against the obstructionism and detainment policy of the 
Communist government.  The Pope\'s personal experience under 
oppressive regimes makes him highly sympathetic to Churches 
in similar situations and thus more inclined to affirm them 
with the naming of a cardinal.  In addition, the Pope named 
one cardinal \"in pectore,\" whose name is not revealed, and 
it is thought that this could be Archbishop Joseph Zen of 
Hong Kong -- though this remains speculation. 
 
--------------------------- 
Africa: Building the Church 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The rapidly growing church in Africa also 
attracted the Pope\'s attention, resulting in a larger share 
of the scarlet for the continent.   The three new members 
will help to redress Africa\'s current underrepresentation 
in the College of Cardinals, though critics complain that 
both Africa and Latin America still remain 
underrepresented.  The elevation of the Archbishop of Cape 
Coast, Ghana, Peter Turkson, is a further reflection of 
Pope John Paul\'s attention to the Muslim world, as the 
Catholic Church in Ghana is challenged by a strong 
 
 
proselytizing effort by Muslims.  One can see similar 
motives in the nomination of Nigeria\'s new cardinal, 
Anthony Olubunmi Okogie, of Lagos -- Africa\'s second 
largest Catholic community. 
 
----------------------- 
Sole Red Hat for the US 
----------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Only one American cardinal was named -- 
Philadelphia\'s new archbishop, Justin Rigali.  Rigali is a 
personal friend of the Pope and served many years as a 
member of the Vatican Curia.  The Philadelphia seat is 
traditionally held by a Cardinal.  So is the Boston seat, 
and thus the decision not to nominate the newly-appointed 
Archbishop of Boston, Sean O\'Malley, raised some eye-brows 
in Vatican circles.  O\'Malley this July replaced Cardinal 
Bernard Law, who resigned after his mishandling of the 
clerical sexual abuse scandal in Boston.  Although O\'Malley 
has already proven himself to be the right man to put the 
Boston shop in order, it is unusual for an archbishop to be 
created a cardinal while his predecessor is still under 80 
and eligible to vote in a papal election.  Still, it is 
clear that Law still has strong support at the Vatican from 
many who believe he was treated as a scapegoat in the sex 
scandal.  With the omission of O\'Malley, Law was spared the 
ignominy of his successor\'s immediate elevation to the 
College of Cardinals. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.(SBU) The latest brace of cardinals contains few real 
surprises.  Pope John Paul has nominated men he can trust 
who have proven themselves faithful sons of the Church. 
Additionally, the Pope has elevated to cardinal individuals 
in posts traditionally filled by cardinals.  As a result, 
Italy gained six new cardinals, while all of Latin America, 
with the largest Catholic population in the world gained 
only three.  While many expected the Pope to announce the 
new cardinals early in 2004, it made more economic and 
logistical sense to conduct the ceremony while the whole 
College was gathered in Rome to celebrate his 25th 
anniversary in October.  Vatican officials have told us 
that the slate of nominees has been ready for several 
weeks.  This does not discount a certain nervousness in the 
Vatican about the Pope\'s increasingly frail health -- a 
fact in evidence September 28 when the struggle to 
pronounce the names of the new cardinals left him 
physically exhausted and supporting his head with one hand. 
Regardless of the timing of the election of the next pope, 
this group will join with the current cardinals to elect a 
successor from the same ecclesiastical mould as John Paul 
II.  Whether a successor would have a similar geopolitical 
vision is less predictable.  End comment.

SUCCEEDS ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN, WHOM POPE JOHN PAUL 
    II WILL CREATE A CARDINAL AT A VATICAN CITY CEREMONY ON 
OCTOBER 21. LAJOLO\'S APPOINTMENT IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE 
CONTINUITY FOR THE VATICAN\'S FOREIGN POLICY.  LAJALO\'S 
MOTHER WAS AMERICAN, AND HE IS CONSIDERED FAVORABLY 
DISPOSED TO THE UNITED STATES. 
 
2. (U) LAJOLO (LA-YO-LO) WAS BORN IN THE NORTHERN ITALIAN 
CITY OF NOVARA ON JANUARY 3, 1935, AND ORDAINED A PRIEST ON 
APRIL 29. 1960.  AFTER WORKING IN THE DIOCESE OF NOVARA, 
LAJOLO ENTERED THE HOLY SEE\'S PRESTIGIOUS DIPLOMATIC 
SCHOOL, THE PONTIFICAL ECCLESIASTICAL ACADEMY, IN 1968 AND 
OBTAINED A DOCTORATE IN CANON LAW (CHURCH LAW). HE ENTERED 
THE HOLY SEE\'S FOREIGN SERVICE IN 1970.  ARCHBISHOP LAJOLO 
HAS SERVED AT THE NUNCIATURE IN GERMANY AND AT THE HOLY 
SEE\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY. THE FUTURE ARCHBISHOP WAS A 
PROFESSOR AT THE PONTIFICAL ECCLESIASTICAL ACADEMY FROM 
1985 UNTIL 1989. IN 1988 HE WAS APPOINTED SECRETARY (NUMBER 
2 POSITION) OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PATRIMONY OF THE 
HOLY SEE (ADMINISTERS THE PROPERTIES OWNED BY THE HOLY SEE 
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE FUNDS NECESSARY FOR THE ROMAN CURIA 
TO FUNCTION).  HE WAS ORDAINED AN ARCHBISHOP IN 1989.  POPE 
JOHN PAUL II APPOINTED LAJOLO AS NUNCIO TO GERMANY IN 1995, 
WHERE HE HAS GENERALLY AVOIDED THE LIMELIGHT.  APART FROM 
HIS NATIVE ITALIAN, THE ARCHBISHOP SPEAKS ENGLISH, FRENCH 
AND GERMAN. 
 
3. (U) LAJOLO WAS THE HOLY SEE\'S POINT MAN DURING THE 2000 
CONFRONTATION WITH GERMAN CATHOLICS OVER CHURCH-BASED 
COUNSELING CENTERS PROVIDING CERTIFICATES LATER USED TO 
PROCURE ABORTIONS.  THE VATICAN ORDERED GERMANY\'S BISHOPS 
TO DROP PREGNANCY COUNSELING FROM THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY 
    THE CENTERS TO PREVENT CHURCH INVOLVEMENT IN STATE-PROVIDED 
ABORTIONS. 
 
4. (SBU) GERMAN EMBASSY DCM, WHO MET WITH LAJOLO BEFORE 
BEGINNING HIS ASSIGNMENT DESCRIBED HIM AS SOMEONE WHO HOLDS 
HIS CARDS VERY CLOSE TO HIS CHEST.  ONE CURRENT SECRETARIAT 
OF STATE OFFICIAL WHO STUDIED UNDER LAJOLO FOR THREE YEARS 
AT THE HOLY SEE\'S ECCLESIASTICAL ACADEMY -- THE VATICAN\'S 
DIPLOMATIC TRAINING SCHOOL -- SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE 
LAJOLO STOOD PERSONALLY ON MOST ISSUES.  AS NUNCIO IN 
GERMANY, LAJOLO WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE SELECTION OF 
GERMAN BISHOPS, BUT HIS INVOLVEMENT ON BROADER 
INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ISSUES WOULD HAVE BEEN LIMITED. 
 
5. (SBU) ONE JOURNALIST WHO HAS RECENTLY INTERVIEWED LAJOLO 
TOLD US THAT LAJOLO\'S MOTHER WAS AMERICAN, HAVING MOVED TO 
THE U.S. AS A CHILD.  SHE WAS RAISED THERE AND RETURNED TO 
ITALY, BUT RETAINED HER CITIZENSHIP THROUGHOUT HER LIFE. 
LAJOLO REPORTEDLY TRAVELED WITHIN THE U.S. TWENTY YEARS AGO 
-- POSSIBLY ON AN INTERNATIONAL VISITOR PROGRAM -- AND HE 
HAS KEPT UP HIS TIES IN THE U.S.  HIS DEPUTY IN BERLIN FOR 
HIS EIGHT YEARS AS NUNCIO WAS AN AMERICAN FROM SIOUX FALLS, 
SOUTH DAKOTA.  THE JOURNALIST DESCRIBED LAJOLO AS OPEN TO

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (c) Under Secretary Bolton told Vatican Deputy Foreign 
Minister Parolin that the U.S. was making steady progress in 
Iraq, even though the security situation was not what we 
would like it to be.  Bolton briefed Parolin on the 
President\'s meeting with Russian President Putin and the 
state of play in UNSC deliberations for a new Iraq 
resolution, emphasizing the U.S. desire to return power to 
the Iraqis as soon as possible.  Parolin raised the Holy 
See\'s concerns about religious persecution against Christians 
in Iraq, but indicated that they have been encouraged by 
inter-religious developments to date.  U/S Bolton reviewed 
the threat posed by Iranian nuclear development efforts, and 
outlined international efforts to address Iran\'s nuclear 
program.  On North Korea, Bolton highlighted U.S. willingness 
to take North Korean security concerns into account, but 
expressed disappointment with the lack of progress at the 
last round of talks.  In response to Parolin\'s questions, 
Bolton reviewed the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) 
as a means of making better use of national legislation and 
law enforcement mechanisms to prevent transfers of WMD. 
Parolin emphasized the Holy See\'s commitment to multilateral 
arms control, and conveyed his regret that the U.S. was not 
more actively involved in the CTBT.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
Building a Democratic Iraq 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (c) Under Secretary John Bolton reviewed developments in 
Iraq, Iran, and North Korea with Holy See\' Deputy Foreign 
Minister Pietro Parolin October 1, emphasizing U.S. 
determination to address threats to international security 
posed by outlaw states\' possession of WMD.  Bolton told 
Parolin that this had been one of the major topics of 
discussion between President Bush and President Putin at 
their September 27 summit.  On Iraq, the Under Secretary 
emphasized that the U.S. and Russia had overcome pre-war 
disagreements, and agreed on the importance of building a 
stable, democratic Iraq that would have a positive influence 
on the rest of the region.  Bolton told Parolin that there 
were many welcome developments in Iraq, such as the opening 
of Iraq\'s refurbished schools with new textbooks and the 
training of 50,000 Iraqi police and military.  Parolin 
indicated that the Vatican\'s nuncio in Iraq generally shared 
this positive perception, despite continuing concerns over 
security in some areas.  Bolton acknowledged that the 
security situation was \"not what we would like,\" largely as a 
result of the actions of Saddam holdovers and other terrorist 
elements attracted to Iraq. 
 
3. (c) Addressing broader international engagement in Iraq, 
Bolton conveyed \"reasonable confidence\" that there would be a 
new UNSC resolution.  He pointed out that the President had 
also met with Chancellor Schroeder and President Chirac, that 
the P-5 and G-8 had met, and that there appeared to be a 
convergence on how to get a resolution done.  Contrary to 
perceptions of acting alone, Bolton noted that troops from 
over 30 countries were on the ground in Iraq, and that, 
although the U.S. role is predominant, there was considerable 
international support.  Bolton also sought to counter the 
misimpression that the U.S. was looking to hold onto power in 
Iraq, observing that \"nobody will be happier than the U.S. to 
return power to the Iraqi people.\"  The worst outcome, he 
cautioned, would be a bad transition that resulted in an 
unstable and fragmented Iraq. 
 
4. (c)  Parolin asked Bolton for his assessment of the timing 
of a transfer to Iraqi sovereignty and authority.  Bolton 
recalled the Secretary\'s recent assessment that it would take 
six months to prepare a constitution, but noted that some in 
Iraq have insisted it will take at least a year to reach that 
stage.  This was not a matter of bad faith on their part, but 
simply that a whole new political culture had to take root 
and big decisions had to be made that would affect Iraqi 
society for years to come.  The U.S. did not accept that this 
would take a year, but we appreciated the importance of 
getting it right.  In this context, Bolton observed that 
France\'s desire to transfer sovereignty without authority 
created a potential for confusion of roles and potential 
conflict that was unacceptable. 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
Concerns for Religious Minorities 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (c) Reiterating that the Vatican nuncio\'s impression of 
the situation in Iraq was generally positive, Parolin asked 
Bolton for his assessment of the situation for religious 
minorities in light of some recent evidence of religious 
intolerance in the south.  The Under Secretary observed that 
cooperation between religious groups has been good, and that 
the risk of fragmentation has been greatly reduced.  While 
there are still elements in the south that would like to see 
an Islamic republic under Sharia law, this represents only 
about one-third of the Shiites or 20 percent of the total 
population.  Bolton assured Parolin that the U.S. was 
committed to building an Iraq in which freedom of religion 
was respected.  Parolin observed that some Christian shops 
that served alcohol had been burned.  Bolton pledged to call 
any incidents of suspected intolerance to Washington\'s 
attention, and urged the Holy See\'s nuncio to relay 
information about such incidents to the Coalition Provisional 
Authority.  Both agreed that it would be better to deal with 
these problems early before they became regular occurrences. 
Parolin observed that the Holy See had been encouraged by 
some statements of a leading Ayatollah in favor of democracy, 
but noted that these \"are just words, and we need to see what 
happens in reality.\"  Bolton noted that some Iranian mullahs 
continued to stir up problems in the south. 
 
--------------------- 
Iran\'s Nuclear Threat 
--------------------- 
 
6. (c) The greater threat from Iran, Bolton then noted, comes 
from Iranian efforts to develop a nuclear capability, which 
the President and President Putin had also discussed at Camp 
David.  Bolton said Russia had agreed not to ship nuclear 
fuel to Iran, and that President Putin appreciated the 
dangers posed by a nuclear Iran, even while some in the 
Russian government and industry continued to cause problems. 
Bolton observed that there appeared to be a debate in Iran 
about whether to sign the IAEA additional protocol, but, 
unfortunately, no debate about whether to have nuclear 
weapons.  The U.S. view, he told Parolin, was that Iran not 
only had to cooperate with IAEA inspections, but also to 
refrain from enriching uranium.  The looming problem was that 
once the new reactor was operational, even if it operated 
under IAEA safeguards, it would have enough fuel in its cycle 
to make 80 nuclear weapons.  It was clear to the U.S. that 
Iran\'s intention was to gain national control over the full 
nuclear production cycle. 
 
7. (c) In response to Iran\'s nuclear ambitions and reluctant 
cooperation with the IAEA, the U.S. had decided to refer the 
issue to the UNSC in order to demonstrate international 
concern and seek a UNSC president\'s Statement urging Iran to 
cooperate.  Parolin noted that he understood that Iran had 
agreed to accept IAEA inspections, but U/S Bolton pointed out 
that although Iran says it will cooperate, it continues to 
delay and deny access - as occurred recently at an Iranian 
electrical facility.  Emphasizing that Iran was engaged in \"a 
campaign of deception,\" Bolton noted that IAEA Head El 
Baradei had warned Iran that if it did not cooperate 
immediately, it could not meet the October 31 IAEA deadline. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
North Korea: Little Progress 
---------------------------- 
 
8. (c) Turning to the North Korean nuclear threat, U/S Bolton 
stressed the U.S. desire to address this threat by diplomatic 
means.  Unfortunately, the outcome of the recent talks in 
Beijing was \"not that positive.\"  Parolin recalled that all 
parties had agreed that the region should be free of nuclear 
weapons, and suggested that this offered a positive point of 
departure.  U/S Bolton explained that the only real outcome 
at the talks had been the agreement to meet again in two 
months, but that it now appeared that even this would not 
happen on schedule as North Korea had indicated it would not 
be ready to meet at that time.  He pointed out that a 
high-level Chinese visit to North Korea had been canceled out 
of concern that the North Koreans would rebuff the Chinese 
appeal for cooperation. 
 
9. (c) Parolin asked Bolton about the degree of U.S. 
willingness to take North Korea\'s security concerns into 
account.  Bolton indicated that the U.S. has discussed some 
form of security assurances, which could be put in writing, 
 
 
though not in the form of a treaty.  Bolton pointed out that 
the U.S. had been prepared to put this on the table and would 
be prepared to do so at the appropriate time in the future. 
Parolin reiterated the Holy See\'s desire that this problem be 
resolved through dialogue. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Proliferation Security Initiative 
--------------------------------- 
 
10. (c) Parolin said he had reviewed carefully the 
information provided by the Embassy on the Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI), and queried whether it was being 
applied only to North Korea.  U/S Bolton observed that North 
Korea earns hard currency from its weapons sales, which it 
uses to develop its own weapons programs.  The U.S., Bolton 
said, believes an increase in the level of interdiction of 
shipments going in and out of North Korea would enhance 
security in regions where they are sold as well as in the 
Korean peninsula.  Asked to compare the PSI to a naval 
blockade, U/S Bolton explained that the initiative was 
broader, seeking to build on existing export control 
mechanisms aimed at prohibiting exports of weapons-related 
materials.  President Bush has called on other countries to 
criminalize the export of items related to WMD, which up to 
now has been a legal gap in many countries domestic 
legislation.  The goal, he stressed, is to make it harder for 
states to participate in such trade.   Asked about the 
relationship between PSI and broader multilateral arms 
control bodies such as the Wassenaar Group and OPCW, Bolton 
explained that PSI aimed to fill a gap in these existing 
mechanisms by creating some form of enforcement mechanism, 
not to supplant them.  Noting that there are some areas where 
international authorities are unclear, Bolton suggested that 
there could be an evolution in international law on the 
suppression of unlawful acts at sea through state practice. 
 
------------------------- 
Multilateral Arms Control 
------------------------- 
 
11. (c) As the meeting drew to a close, DFM Parolin expressed 
his surprise when he discovered at a recent CTBT conference 
in Vienna that the U.S. \"was not there.\"  U/S Bolton noted 
that the U.S. had been present a low level only, as a result 
of our decision not to ratify the CTBT.  Nevertheless, Bolton 
pointed out, the President\'s moratorium on nuclear testing 
remains in place.  In this context, Parolin observed that the 
Holy See was \"worried\" about the problem of international 
disarmament and believed that multilateral cooperation was 
essential to meet the threat posed by WMD. U/S Bolton 
responded that the U.S. recognized the importance of 
multilateral arms control, but also recognized that in a 
world where North Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria operated 
outside of such mechanisms in their pursuit of WMD, other 
measures were needed to meet the threat.  \"People are 
watching Iran and North Korea,\" Bolton cautioned, \"and if 
they succeed in their pursuit of nuclear weapons, the whole 
NPT framework would be at risk.\"  Bolton recalled President 
Bush\'s admonition that the biggest threat to the world today 
is the most dangerous weapons in the hands of the most 
dangerous people.  These are individuals and groups not 
susceptible to deterrence or threats of retaliation, and that 
is the scenario the U.S. is working to prevent.  Parolin 
agreed that weapons in irresponsible hands represented a 
grave danger and must be prevented.

SUBJECT: JOHN PAUL II: 25 YEAR CHAMPION OF HUMAN DIGNITY 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) Pope John Paul II marked the 25th anniversary of his 
Pontificate October 16 with over 70,000 well-wishers in St. 
Peter\'s square.  The Pope is one of the most compelling 
public figures of the 20th Century, and continues to garner 
international attention even as he struggles with physical 
limitations of Parkinson\'s disease and ageing.  John Paul 
II has transformed the Papacy, making it not only the 
spiritual guide to the world\'s billion Catholics, but 
perhaps the leading moral voice in the world today, 
respected and listened to even in countries with limited 
Catholic influence.  Under his leadership, the Holy See has 
become a visible and effective political force for freedom, 
justice, and reconciliation.  It has also greatly expanded 
its diplomatic presence, more than doubling from 85 to 174 
the number of countries with whom it maintains diplomatic 
relations.  The Pope\'s untiring determination to promote 
human dignity has distinguished every aspect of his papacy, 
leading him to place himself on the side of the poor, the 
disinherited, the oppressed, the marginalized and the 
defenseless.  The United States has no better partner for 
achieving our primary national security goal of promoting 
human dignity worldwide.   End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Champion of Human Dignity 
------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Pope John Paul II has put an indelible mark on the 
papacy and on the Church he leads.  Elected to the Papacy 
October 16, 1978 with keen intellectual gifts, a tenacious 
will and clear, uncompromising values, he has traveled the 
equivalent of three times to the moon visiting over 1000 
cities in his dual roles as pastor and statesman, 
evangelizer of the Catholic faith and promoter of human 
rights and freedom.  What has most distinguished his Papacy 
has been his constant affirmation of the centrality of the 
human person and his or her dignity, and his ability to 
place this advocacy in the context of the modern world and 
the Church\'s traditional social teachings.  For example, he 
took on the United Nations community as it dealt with 
women, population, and the family at Cairo and Beijing, and 
he has tirelessly campaigned against the death penalty and 
abortion -- defining these as signs of a culture of death. 
The Pope has shaped the Holy See into a moral compass that 
is listened to, if not always followed, by people on every 
continent. 
 
3. (U) John Paul II\'s papacy has been marked not only by 
its message, but very much by its messenger.  The Pope has 
brought the papacy to the world in a way that has 
revolutionized expectations of who a Pope is and what a 
Pope should do.  Before John Paul II, Popes rarely traveled 
outside Rome.  John Paul II, by contrast, has been the 
first truly international pope, one who has traveled to the 
most remote regions of the globe.  In his travels, he has 
taken a message of hope and faith, expressed in his 
frequent personal appeals for peace, for human rights, for 
international justice, religious freedom, for medical 
ethics and in his innovative gestures of dialogue and 
openness towards Jews, Muslims, Orthodox Christians and 
other world religions.  His message has also been reflected 
in his calls to close the gap between rich and poor and for 
prosperous nations to embrace immigrants fleeing oppression 
and poverty.  The target of an assassin\'s bullet, he has in 
recent years suffered painfully and publicly with 
Parkinson\'s disease and a series of ailments that have 
limited the once athletic Pope to a rolling throne used to 
move him where he needs to go - a limitation that has not, 
however, dampened his determination to continue to carry 
out his mission. 
 
--------------------------- 
Shepherd of a Restive Flock 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (U) While revolutionizing the Holy See\'s engagement with 
the world, the Pope has also sought to re-package Christian 
practice and teaching.  In his speeches, encyclicals, 
personal reflections, and pastoral letters, in his focus on 
youth and family, and in his defense of human life, the 
Pope has sought to explain the complex nexus that draws 
together God, man, politics, Church, and civil society.  In 
this effort, he has won the admiration of millions, but has 
also been pilloried by critics on the left and right for 
his positions on birth control, the role of women in the 
church, homosexuality, and the excesses of capitalism and 
secularism.  His personal popularity has not always 
translated into action or adherence among Catholic 
 
faithful, many of whom ignore the Pope\'s teachings on birth 
control, divorce, abortion, and homosexuality.  While the 
church is growing in Africa, the Americas and Asia, in the 
Pope\'s home ground, it is gasping for survival in an 
increasingly secular Europe that was unwilling to include a 
reference to Europe\'s Christian roots in its constitution 
despite the Pope\'s persistent lobbying of European leaders 
and people.  Nevertheless, the Pope\'s pre-Millennium 
meetings in Rome with hundreds of bishops from the five 
continents generated a series of internal policy documents 
that will guide the Catholic Church\'s activities in those 
regions for decades.  (Septels will explore the Pope\'s 
contribution to and challenges in specific regions.) 
 
------------------ 
Crusader for Peace 
------------------ 
 
5. (U) From the beginning of his papacy, the Pope has 
sought not only to engage Catholics, but to reach out to 
the world and embrace its many cultures, religions, races 
and ethnic groups.  In doing so, he has built bridges 
between cultures and religions that have helped overcome 
divisions in troubled regions of the world.  The Pope\'s 
messages and efforts on behalf of international peace have 
been a prominent and consistent feature of his Papacy. 
Since his election, the Pope has issued annual Peace 
Messages to world leaders and civil authorities that have 
encouraged nuclear disarmament and opposed arms transfers, 
analyzed the economic roots of armed conflict, promoted 
national reconciliation efforts, explored the links between 
peace and the dignity of women and children, and expressed 
support for the role of the United Nations to guarantee 
world peace.  The Pope has also issued specific appeals for 
peace and placed in motion the Holy See\'s diplomatic 
machine when the clouds of war have rolled over the horizon 
-- most recently over the war in Iraq. 
 
6. (U) But Pope John Paul II has not only talked about 
peace, he has engaged both himself and the diplomatic 
machinery of the Holy See to achieve peace in the face of 
conflicts in many parts of the world.  In his nearly 1700 
meetings with heads of state, heads of government, and 
other senior government leaders, issues of war and peace 
have inevitably been high on the agenda.  The Pope\'s 
diplomatic efforts were crucial to avoiding war between 
Chile and Argentina over the Beagle Channel border dispute 
in 1978.  This set the tone for a papacy that recognized 
the potential of timely mediation by a Holy See acting 
\"super partes.\"  In another conflict involving Argentina, 
the 1982 Falkland crisis with Britain, Pope John Paul II 
invited the Catholic cardinals from England, Scotland and 
Argentina to Rome to concelebrate a Mass of Reconciliation 
with him in St. Peter\'s.  Observing then that \"peace is an 
obligation, peace is a duty\", the Pope announced that he 
would visit not only Great Britain, to which Queen 
Elizabeth II had already invited him, but also Argentina. 
His subsequent papal visits to the two countries underlined 
his role in promoting reconciliation among parties to a 
conflict. 
 
7. (U) Pope John Paul II has likewise supported efforts to 
achieve reconciliation between conflicting parties in 
troubled areas such as Lebanon, the Balkans, the Great 
Lakes, and East Timor, where Vatican diplomats were 
particularly active in achieving a resolution to a long- 
festering zone of conflict.  Though not all Vatican 
diplomatic efforts have been successful, the Pope has never 
weakened in his conviction that the Holy See should do 
everything possible to prevent war, encourage fractious 
parties to dialogue, and promote the greater value of peace 
over war.  This conviction has put him at odds with the 
United States over both the Gulf War of 1991 and the Iraq 
war this year.  In both cases, the Pope believed that the 
international community had not exhausted all peaceful 
means short of war, though he also criticized the actions 
and inactions of the Iraqi government that had provoked 
both conflicts and acknowledged that decisions of war and 
peace must be made by legitimate civil authorities. 
 
8. (U) While the Pope is a man of peace, he is not a 
pacifist.  In fact, he has frequently called for 
\"humanitarian intervention\" or peacekeeping in trouble 
spots such as Kosovo, Bosnia, Central Africa, and East 
Timor -- even if that meant using force to \"disarm the 
aggressor.\"  He has also strongly condemned terrorism, and 
recognized that the United States needed to respond in 
self-defense after the September 11 attacks.  In fact, he 
has often observed that genuine peace must be built of a 
foundation of liberty, justice, truth, and love, and he 
recognizes that the international community needs to strive 
to create these conditions if it is to achieve a more 
 
peaceful world.  That is why he has so vigorously advocated 
religious liberty and human rights during pastoral visits 
to many countries, including Cuba and Nigeria in 1998. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Advocate of Reconciliation and Dialogue 
--------------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) The most original of John Paul II\'s efforts to craft 
a culture of peace have been his continuing and deepening 
efforts to promote inter-religious dialogue and to overcome 
religious divisions - including those among Christians. 
For example, the Pope has done taken sometimes dramatic 
steps to appeal to the Orthodox and Protestant churches, as 
those closest to Catholicism in doctrine and practice, to 
strive for unity not just in the abstract but also in the 
concrete -- even to the extent of asking for their input on 
how a Pope should exercise his ministry in an ecumenical 
age.  In Greece, the heartland of the Orthodox Church, the 
Pope made a sweeping apology on behalf of Catholics for 
misdeeds committed over centuries against members of the 
Orthodox Church saying it was time to \"heal the wounds\" 
that have divided Eastern and Western churches for nearly 
1,000 years.  He has been willing to talk systematically 
with Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and animists. 
Wherever possible, if it did not already exist, Pope John 
Paul II has set up continuing commissions and other fora in 
which honest and serious efforts to understand and resolve 
differences in theology, science, philosophy and culture 
can be constantly addressed. 
 
10. (U) Pope John Paul II\'s spirit of humble certainty has 
often translated into significant gestures of repentance 
and reconciliation -- gestures sometimes criticized by his 
most senior advisors but which have helped overcome 
centuries of distrust and division.  In particular, he has 
made great strides to repair Catholic-Jewish divisions. 
After becoming the first Pope since Peter to step inside a 
Jewish synagogue, John Paul moved to open relations with 
Israel in 1993 and in 1997 authorized a Vatican conference 
on the roots of anti-Judaism in Christianity.  In 1998, the 
Holy See published its official document on the Shoah, 
acknowledging Catholic failings in failing to counter a 
climate of persecution that resulted in the holocaust. 
During the jubilee year of 2000, he lead his most senior 
advisors in a Vatican \"Day of Parson\" to apologize for 
Christianity\'s errors towards Judaism, Islam, and 
Protestant Christians.  Later that year the Pope prayed at 
Judaism\'s holiest site, the Western Wall, and, in an 
unprecedented gesture of reconciliation, asked Jews to 
forgive centuries of Christian sins against their people. 
\"We are deeply saddened,\" he told the Israelis, \"by the 
behavior of those who in the course of history have caused 
these children of yours to suffer and, asking your 
forgiveness, we wish to commit ourselves to genuine 
brotherhood with the people of the Covenant.\" 
 
11. (U) On a visit to Syria that same year, John Paul 
reached out to Muslims with words of sorrow and prayed in a 
Damascus mosque, observing:  \"It is my ardent hope that 
Muslim and Christian religious leaders and teachers will 
present our two great religious communities as communities 
in respectful dialogue, never more as communities in 
conflict.  For all the times that Muslims and Christians 
have offended one another, we need to seek forgiveness from 
the Almighty and offer each other forgiveness.\"  He has 
also visited other predominantly Muslim countries from 
Morocco to Kazakhstan, earning respect and drawing large 
crowds eager to see the Pope who entered a mosque.  Among 
the most visible manifestations of the Pope\'s commitment to 
breaking down religious barriers have been the three 
interfaith meetings he hosted in the Italian town of 
Assisi.  The 1986, 1993 and 2002 encounters brought 
together Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and 
representatives from a variety of other religious 
expressions to pray for peace.  In 2002 following the 
September 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S., the delegates 
in Assisi denounced all violence in the name of religion 
and rejected the idea of a war of civilizations or 
cultures. Many religious leaders have commented that these 
gatherings were only possible because of the Pope\'s moral 
stature and record of reconciliation. 
 
12. (U) The Pope has not limited his reconciliation efforts 
to religious matters.  In 1992, on the Senegalese island of 
Goree, he made a heartfelt apology on behalf of Christians 
who took part in centuries of slavery.  Describing the 
slave trade as an \"unknown holocaust and an enormous 
crime,\" he said it was imperative to confess with humility 
this crime against humanity.\"  John Paul II also had no 
qualms about rehabilitating Galileo Galilei and encouraging 
scientists to continue their inquiry into the \"big bang\" 
 
theory behind creation.  As a churchman Pope John Paul II 
has never been afraid of engagement with the scientific 
world because, in his words, \"we know that the truth cannot 
contradict the truth.\"  While such gestures have sometimes 
been criticized within the Catholic Church as threats to 
traditional doctrinal positions or as undermining the 
prestige of the papacy and the Catholic Church, Pope John 
Paul II has been willing to accept this criticism for the 
sake of healing wounds and overcoming divisions. 
 
-------------------- 
Catalyst for Freedom 
-------------------- 
 
13. (U) When John Paul II took up his papacy, communism was 
all but bankrupt in Poland and the conditions necessary for 
a popular revolt against the Soviet-sponsored regime were 
in place -- economic stagnation, state persecutions of 
intellectual and religious leaders, and a series of 
workers\' strikes and student protests.  Into this sea of 
discontent, Karol Wojtyla returned to his homeland in June 
1979 as the Pope.  During open-air Masses and other events, 
millions of Poles saw or heard their native son challenge 
the moral premise of the totalitarian system, demand 
freedom for the church, and affirm the right of the workers 
to organize.  Poland\'s leaders heard his courageous 
admonition, \"Order flows from respect for the rights of the 
nation and for human rights.\"  The papal attack on the 
morally bankrupt system continued in subsequent visits, 
when John Paul chided the Polish premier for his regime\'s 
human rights abuses and reminded workers that \"solidarity\" 
means that burdens are shared, in community -- not through 
the class struggles promoted by Marxists.  The Polish Pope 
reawakened the spirit of resistance and freedom in the 
Polish people, giving them the courage to seek the freedoms 
too long denied. 
 
14. (U) In this case, as in many others during his Papacy, 
the Pope\'s direct approach broke with traditional Vatican 
policy, which previously had emphasized official dealings 
with sovereign powers, either through concordats or 
dialogue.  However, Pope John Paul II recognized that in 
the emerging milieu of global communications, the church 
would have greater impact by \"acting\" within civil society 
rather than acting in collaboration with sometimes corrupt 
or bankrupt national governments.  The Pope carried this 
message directly to the masses - not only in Poland but 
also in Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia.  His 
engagement in these communist countries became a catalyst 
for change, resistance, and freedom, which together with 
the U.S. efforts to oppose communism, exposed the 
hollowness of the communist system and hastened its demise. 
 
15. (U) In Poland as elsewhere, the Pope has been 
constantly aware of the power of his presence and his moral 
voice.  His ability to read the ecclesiastical and 
political situation of a particular region or nation led 
him to develop travel itineraries designed to achieve the 
most benefit -- masses with the masses in Poland as 
communism suffered its death throws, a visit to the 
Philippines during the Marcos regime to cement his 
friendship with Cardinal Jaime Sin and to give a papal 
\"nulla osta\" to the eventual peoples\' revolution, an 
accusing finger pointed at Jean-Claude Duvalier in Haiti 
and a bold call for change in that dictatorship, a blunt 
challenge to Sudan\'s Islamist leaders that there could be 
no peace without justice and respect for human rights, a 
controversial visit to Chile and the seeming embrace of the 
Pinochet regime that in reality strengthened the local 
church\'s efforts for human rights and led eighteen months 
after the papal visit to a process of reconstructing 
Chilean civil society, a national plebiscite to move beyond 
military rule and to restore democracy. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
15. (U) In his inaugural homily 25 years ago, the Pope told 
the world:  \"Be not afraid.\"  This admonition has been the 
distinguishing characteristic of his pontificate, as he has 
repeatedly acted as no Pope had done before, reshaping the 
Papacy and public expectations of the Pope.  He has brought 
the Papacy to the modern world with a directness and 
immediacy that was unimaginable before his pontificate, and 
made the Holy See a central player on the international 
scene -- as seen this year in the stream of world leaders 
who called on the Pope during the lead-up to the Iraq war. 
Now the fourth-longest serving Pope in history, John Paul 
II\'s increasing frailty will give his presence, at both the 
ecclesiastical and international level, a new quality -- 
physically more subdued though still morally compelling. 
 
Our reading is that the Pope is still very much in charge 
of the Vatican, with an intellectual acuteness that 
continues to impress his closest collaborators.  As he 
reportedly told one of his Cardinals, \"I don\'t run this 
Church with my feet.\"  It is likely that the Pope\'s 
international travels will be more limited, though he has a 
number of invitations pending for the coming year. 
Nevertheless, we can expect his moral reach will continue 
to extend worldwide through his appeals on international 
issues, teachings and commentaries.  As one of the world\'s 
leading individual voices for human dignity, Pope John Paul 
II -- even with his physical limitations -- remains a vital 
partner for advancing U.S. efforts worldwide to champion 
human dignity.  As we seek to promote freedom, break down 
religious and cultural barriers, promote development, 
relieve human suffering, and stand up for human life, we 
have no better partner than John Paul II.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and 
Peace Archbishop Renato Martino told visiting EB Biotech 
negotiator Peter Chase October 10 that the Holy See is in the 
final stages of planning for its November 10-11 conference on 
biotech foods.  Although the Council for Justice and Peace 
will include dissenting voices such as Greenpeace in its 
program, Martino indicated that the majority of speakers were 
pro-biotech.  Martino sought to downplay expectations of a 
Vatican statement emerging during or immediately after the 
conference, though we understand from our contacts that this 
issue is still being debated.  Martino indicated that to make 
the case for biotech most effectively, it would be useful to 
have developing country farmers who have had positive 
experiences with transgenic crops to offer their personal 
testimony, and requested U.S. ideas for potential speakers 
who have not previously been used in high-profile USG public 
events.  Chase pledged to provide names, which have since 
been forwarded to Martino\'s office.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Visiting EB Special Negotiator for biotech Peter 
Chase told Archbishop Renato Martino, President of the 
Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, October 10 that 
agriculture and agricultural production in developing 
countries had been a key focus for the U.S. over the past 
year and would remain so.  Enabling poor people to grow their 
own food is the best way to address hunger and poverty, Chase 
observed.  In this regard, the U.S. believed biotech crops 
offered great potential to contribute to this larger effort. 
Chase told Martino that the United States appreciated the way 
the Holy See had approached the issue of biotechnology, 
particularly its emphasis on exploring the science involved 
and willingness to maintain an open mind on the potential 
contribution of biotech foods.  His goal in coming to Rome 
was to determine how we could work better together with the 
Holy See to move the scientific debate along and achieve a 
stronger international consensus on the issue. 
 
3. (SBU) Archbishop Martino, citing the Holy See\'s desire to 
do everything possible to eradicate poverty and hunger, 
reiterated the Vatican\'s openness to the potential of biotech 
foods.  He said he had gone to the Sacramento conference this 
past summer to observe what is being done in this field of 
research.  He pointed out that the Holy See had not yet 
adopted any official position in favor of or against biotech 
foods, though its Pontifical Science Council had indicated 
there is no reason why such foods should not be eaten if 
carefully regulated and tested.  In order to arrive at a more 
definitive position, his Council has decided to organize a 
\"study session\" on biotech foods November 10-11 which Martino 
expects (though he did not say so at this meeting) will lay a 
foundation for a stronger Vatican position on biotech foods. 
To this point the Vatican has issued positive, but cautious 
public statements on the subject. 
 
4.  (SBU) According to Martino, the two-day program will be 
divided into four parts:   1) The state of science and 
research, including the contribution of the Pontifical 
Science Council; 2) GMOs and the environment, and GMOs and 
health; 3) biotech foods and international trade; and 4) the 
ethical implications of biotech foods.  Martino noted that 
most of the speaking participants would be pro-biotech, 
though they had had to add some dissenting voices such as 
Greenpeace for balance to enhance the credibility of the 
conference.  He also noted that the World Food Program and 
FAO would be included in the program.  The one area where 
they had not yet locked in the speakers they needed was in 
the area of producers and consumers -- particularly 
developing country farmers or researchers.  Justice and Peace 
Undersecretary Monsignor Frank Dewane, who is coordinating 
the conference for Martino, requested U.S. help in 
identifying farmers who could speak to the value of biotech 
crops based on personal experience.  He cautioned that these 
could not be the same farmers, such as T.J. Buthelezi, who 
had previously spoken on behalf of the U.S.  Chase promised 
to provide some names, and subsequently passed to Embassy 
some potential contacts. 
 
5. (SBU) Monsignor James Reinert, who is taking the lead on 
the biotech issue within the Justice and Peace Council, told 
Chase that the majority of communication the Vatican received 
on biotech foods was negative -- especially in reaction to 
earlier inaccurate media reports that the Vatican had 
endorsed biotech foods (Ref A).  He noted that the most 
common criticisms of GMO food are that there is already 
enough food in the world and thus no need for biotech 
products, that biotech foods will take away freedom from 
 
developing countries, locking them into a cycle of dependence 
on a few multinational companies, and that agricultural 
biodiversity will be eroded.  He also mentioned that health 
safety concerns continued to surface, citing a claim from 
Catholic bishops in the Philippines that there had been 
allergic reactions to BT corn there.  Chase responded that 
these critiques can be easily refuted.  He also noted that 
the U.S. FDA would be interested in any legitimate claims of 
public health problems, and promised to look into the claims 
in the Philippines and report back any resulting information 
through the Embassy. 
 
6.  (SBU) Responding to Chase\'s case for biotech crops, 
Dewane asked whether the U.S. had developed any statistics 
regarding productivity increases or decreases in agricultural 
losses in developing countries using biotech crops.  He noted 
that such figures could prove very useful to help make the 
biotech case.  Chase cited evidence for South Africa\'s cotton 
production, and said he would provide more information on 
this to the Council.  He pointed out that 27 percent of all 
biotech crops are now grown in developing countries.  Chase 
also noted that USAID would be hosting a three-day conference 
in Africa later this fall to examine biotech applications in 
Africa. 
 
7. (SBU) Martino returned to the issue of developing country 
farmer dependence on seeds and the often-heard claim that 
farmers remain obliged to buy seeds because of a gene in the 
seeds that prevents using seed from biotech crops.  While 
Martino understands that this is not true, he suggested that 
more needs to be done to publicize this and overcome 
misinformation.  Martino also strongly urged the U.S. to drop 
its WTO case, suggesting that a WTO case will \"work against, 
not for\" the U.S. effort to gain acceptance of biotech foods. 
 Chase pledged to take Martino\'s suggestion back to 
Washington, but reviewed the U.S. concerns that had prompted 
the case -- particularly the spread of misinformation to 
developing countries and the EU\'s failure to take a 
science-based approach to its regulatory decision making. 
 
8. (SBU) COMMENT:  Despite Martino\'s cautions on a clear 
outcome emerging from the November conference, he has 
indicated to the Embassy that his goal is to move the Holy 
See gradually toward a more positive public stance.  Martino, 
who was elevated to the position of cardinal October 21, 
remains our best ally on this issue within the Holy See, but 
will have to work carefully within the curia to bring his 
colleagues along.  Embassy welcomes Department\'s suggestions 
on participants for the conference provided by EB, and would 
also appreciate clarification of the health concerns raised 
by the Justice and Peace officials.  Chase\'s visit garnered 
positive coverage for biotech both on Vatican radio and in 
Italy\'s national Catholic daily newspaper, which ran a 
full-page of biotech coverage after the visit with prominent 
placement of Chase and his explanation of the USG\'s approach 
on the issue.

SUBJECT: BIOTECH: IIP VISITOR GIDDINGS INFORMS VATICAN 
OFFICIALS, DIPLOMATS 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.Embassy hosted Dr. Val Giddings, Vice-President for 
Food and Agriculture at the US Biotechnology Industry 
Organization, for a two-day program of talks and 
presentations with Holy See officials and the Vatican 
diplomatic community in late September.  The Coordinator of 
International Information Programs (IIP) sponsored the 
visit.  Giddings\' presentations debunked the popular 
mythology surrounding agricultural biotech and highlighted 
the moral imperative of developing biotech foods, given 
their potential for alleviating famine in developing 
countries. 
 
------------------ 
ONE-ON-ONE CONTACT 
------------------ 
 
2.  Giddings\' program included one-on-one meetings with key 
Vatican biotech players including officials at the 
Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, the Holy See\'s 
Permanent Observer to the FAO and WFP, and the vice- 
president of the Pontifical Council for Life.  Ambassador 
Nicholson hosted a working lunch where Giddings met with 
scientists, Italian agricultural specialists and Vatican 
officials to discuss biotech issues.  These meetings 
reinforced our effort to expand understanding among key 
Vatican decision makers and to resolve some of their 
outstanding concerns. 
 
--------------- 
PUBLIC OUTREACH 
--------------- 
 
3.  At a public lecture at the prestigious Regina 
Apostolorum Pontifical University, Giddings addressed 
common misconceptions on biotech and the moral aspects of 
the question.  Following the speech and a question and 
answer period, Giddings spoke to journalists from the 
Regina Apostolorum newsletter and ANSA, the principal 
Italian news agency, about the many biotech \"myths\" 
circulating in Europe.  Additionally, Vatican Radio 
interviewed Giddings about the scientific and moral/ethical 
aspects of biotechnology.  His comments were broadcast to 
an international audience with millions of potential 
listeners.  The interview was later available on Vatican 
Radio\'s web site. 
 
---------------------------- 
WORKING THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
---------------------------- 
 
4.Central to Giddings\' visit was an extremely successful 
round-table hosted by the Ambassador with diplomats 
accredited to the Holy See and selected representatives of 
the Holy See.  Giddings reviewed key issues surrounding 
biotechnology and refuted specious anti-biotech arguments 
proffered by some in the group.  Some 30 ambassadors 
accredited to the Vatican attended the session in a crowd 
of nearly 40 diplomatic personnel.  At the request of 
attendees, Embassy provided additional reading material on 
biotech issues, and a copy of Giddings power point 
presentation to interested embassies following the event. 
Ambassadors from Israel, Canada, Greece and Germany emerged 
as allies for biotech promotion at the Holy See. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
COMMENT: VISIT SET STAGE FOR VATICAN CONFERENCE, AND MORE 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
5.The Holy See\'s Council for Justice and Peace will host 
an international meeting in Vatican City in mid-November to 
consider the science, ethics and moral implications of 
biotechnology (reftels).  Giddings\' visit helped set the 
stage for the Vatican conference, providing useful 
background and ammunition for those open to the development 
of biotech foods, and challenging the naysayers, as well as 
framing the issue for the wider Vatican community.  Our 
outreach to the diplomatic corps has proven especially 
important as other missions have begun to join us in 
pressing the Holy See on the issue and could help influence 
their capitals by linking the scientific and moral 
arguments regarding biotech foods.  Giddings\' visit 
advanced an ongoing effort to build the moral case for 
biotech to a Vatican and diplomatic audience attuned to 
moral issues. 
E 
 
 
6.  Embassy thanks IIP for providing the funding and 
support for Giddings\' visit.  Such outreach is key to 
winning over the Vatican to the potential of biotechnology 
in combating hunger and disease; and protecting the 
environment, especially in the developing world.

Classified By: Ambassador Jim Nicholson for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) This cable contains an action request.  Please see 
paragraph 3. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
HOLY SEE FORESEES NO PROBLEM ON PASSPORT REQUEST 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (U) Poloff met October 24 with Holy See Office Director 
for Iraq Franco Coppola to deliver Ref A demarche and 
non-paper on Iraqi diplomatic and service passports. 
Coppola did not anticipate that the Vatican would have any 
difficulty honoring Iraqi passports or facilitating travel of 
Iraqi diplomatic and official personnel.  Coppola took on 
board our nonpaper, noting the serial numbers of the 
passports in question. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
ACTION REQUEST: IRAQI DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) Coppola said that the Holy See has had no news of a 
new Iraqi ambassador to the Vatican.  He was also unsure of 
the whereabouts of the former ambassador to the Vatican, 
Abdul-Amir Al-Anbari (and his staff).  Post has previously 
advised the Holy See per Department guidance that the 
Ambassador had failed to report to the Provisional 
Authorities in Iraq and therefore should no longer considered 
an Iraqi representative.  Post requests information on plans 
for Iraqi diplomatic presence in Vatican City and any revised 
guidance on the diplomatic/legal status of previous Iraqi 
diplomatic staff accredited to the Holy See. 
 
--------------------- 
UNSCR: A STEP FORWARD 
--------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Turning to the recently-passed UN Security Council 
Resolution (UNSCR) on Iraq, Coppola called it \"a step 
forward.\"  He acknowledged the importance of the unanimous 
vote on the resolution, and said its passage was not just a 
victory for the U.S., but for the entire Security Council, 
which the Holy See believes needs to find common ground and 
cooperate on Iraq.  Still, Coppola lamented the lack of 
enthusiasm on the part of some members of the Security 
Council, and said the next step would be for all parties to 
exhibit \"concrete collaboration on the ground.\"  In a related 
point, Coppola noted the presence of Archbishop Paul Josef 
Cordes, President of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, at the 
international donors conference for Iraqi recnstruction in 
Madrid.  Cor Unum is the arm of th Vatican that coordinates 
the activities of Vatian-related development agencies and 
distributes onations made to the Church for worldwide 
humaniarian aid initiatives (REF D).  Archbishop Cordes had 
visited Iraq shortly after the end of hostilities to deliver 
assistance from the Pope and coordinate Catholic assistance 
with local bishops and Caritas Iraq, which remains active in 
providing medical assistance in major cities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
DECISION SHOULD COME SOON ON NEW CHALDEAN PATRIARCH 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (C) Turning to the pending decision to name a new 
patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church in Iraq, Coppola 
said a decision by the Pope should be forthcoming \"in the 
coming days.\"  After the death of Chaldean Patriarch Raphael 
Bidawid in July, a synod of Chaldean bishops convened in 
Baghdad in August to select a new patriarch; however, no 
candidate gained the necessary percentage of votes to be 
forwarded to the Pope for his approval.  In this case, 
Coppola told us, the Pope has a free hand to choose the next 
patriarch, and will do so soon.  The Holy See recognizes it 
should not \"leave the Chaldeans without a leader for too 
long,\" Coppola said.  (COMMENT: The new Chaldean Patriarch 
will likely play a role in Chaldean efforts to gain greater 
representation in Iraqi government structures.  While 19 
Chaldean religious leaders complained in a September letter 
to the Coalition Provisional Authority of insufficient 
representation of Christians on national councils and 
commissions, Vatican news agency Fides reported later in the 
month on Christian representation on several regional 
councils.  END COMMENT.) 
 
6. (U) Minimize considered.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) HOLY SEE DIPLOMATS WHO ATTENDED THE SEPTEMBER 24- 
25 CONGRESS OF WORLD AND TRADITIONAL NATIONAL RELIGIONS IN 
ASTANA, KAZAKHSTAN REGARD THE FORUM AS AN IMPORTANT STEP 
FORWARD FOR INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE.  THE HOLY SEE, WHICH 
HAS BEEN ACTIVELY PROMOTING SUCH A DIALOGUE FOR DECADES, 
WELCOMED THE INITIATIVE AS A SIGNAL THAT THEIR EFFORTS ARE 
BEARING FRUIT WITHIN THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  RECOGNIZING THIS, 
THE HOLY SEE SENT A HIGH-POWERED DELEGATION WITH TWO 
CARDINALS, AN ARCHBISHOP AND TWO OTHER HIGH-LEVEL CURIA 
OFFICIALS.  THE VATICAN\'S GROWING DETERMINATION TO ADVANCE 
INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE MAKES IT AN IMPORTANT U.S. PARTNER 
IN OUR EFFORT TO OVERCOME PERCEPTIONS OF RELIGIOUS MYOPIA 
IN THE U.S. AND RELIGIOUS DIVISION BETWEEN THE WEST AND THE 
ISLAMIC WORLD.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
SPIRIT OF ASSISI REACHES ALMATY 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (SBU) THE CONGRESS OF WORLD AND TRADITIONAL NATIONAL 
RELIGIONS IN ASTANA, KAZAKHSTAN SEPT. 23-24 WAS AN 
IMPORTANT STEP IN INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE AND \"LAID THE 
GROUNDWORK\" FOR FUTURE ADVANCES, ACCORDING TO VATICAN 
DELEGATE JOZEF MAJ OF THE HOLY SEE\'S PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR 
THE PROMOTION OF CHRISTIAN UNITY.  THE GATHERING -- ONE OF 
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IN A PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM COUNTRY IN 
    RECENT TIMES -- BROUGHT TOGETHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM 17 
FAITHS AND DENOMINATIONS, INCLUDING ISLAM, JUDAISM, 
CHRISTIANITY, SHINTO, HINDUISM, AND BUDDHISM, FOR 
INTERFAITH DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSIONS ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION. 
HIGH-LEVEL ATTENDEES INCLUDED THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE 
MUSLIM WORLD LEAGUE AND THE CHIEF RABBI OF ISRAEL. 
ARCHBISHOP TOMASZ PETA OF ASTANA DESCRIBED THE MEETING, 
WHICH WAS PROMOTED AND ORGANIZED BY PRESIDENT NURSULTAN 
NARZABAYEV, AS \"A FRUIT OF THE POPE\'S VISIT\" TO KAZAKHSTAN 
IN 2001, DURING WHICH THE POPE EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN RELIGIONS AS A SIGNIFICANT INSTRUMENT FOR 
BUILDING PEACE.  IT ALSO REFLECTED THE SPIRIT OF INTER- 
RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE, WHICH THE POPE FIRST LAUNCHED IN A 1986 
MEETING IN ASSISI AND CONTINUED WITH A 2002 ASSISI MEETING 
AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS. 
 
3.  (SBU) THE CONFERENCE PRODUCED A JOINT DECLARATION 
CALLING FOR DIALOGUE, TOLERANCE, AND EDUCATION IN THE 
PROMOTION OF PEACE WHILE CONDEMNING EXTREMISM, TERRORISM, 
AND OTHER FORMS OF VIOLENCE IN THE NAME OF RELIGION.  THE 
DECLARATION, DISCUSSIONS, AND COMMON PRAYER DURING THE 
EVENT, MAJ BELIEVED, REPRESENTED AN IMPORTANT \"START\" 
WITHIN MULTI-CONFESSIONAL COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL ASIA TO 
FOSTER RECONCILIATION AND UNDERSTANDING.  DELEGATES AGREED 
IN THE DECLARATION TO CONVENE AT LEAST EVERY THREE YEARS IN 
A SIMILAR FORUM, AND DESIGNATED KAZAKHSTAN TO ORGANIZE THE 
NEXT MEETING IN THREE YEARS TIME. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
NEEDED EXAMPLE IN A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD 
-------------------------------------- 

4.  (SBU) JULIO MURAT, THE HOLY SEE\'S OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR 
KAZAKHSTAN, WHO WAS ALSO PART OF THE VATICAN\'S DELEGATION 
TO THE CONFERENCE, TOLD US HE ATTACHED GREAT SIGNIFICANCE 
TO THE FACT THAT THE CONFERENCE WAS HELD IN A PREDOMINANTLY 
MUSLIM, POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRY IN CENTRAL ASIA.  \"THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS THIS KIND OF EXAMPLE,\" MURAT SAID.  HE 
SAW A DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE NAZARBAYEV GOVERNMENT TO 
AVOID \"FANATICISM AND AN ISLAMICIZED SOCIETY\" AND HE HOPED 
ITS EXAMPLE COULD INFLUENCE OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS SAUDI 
ARABIA AND IRAN AND, IN TIME, CONTRIBUTE TO BUILDING A LESS 
FERTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR TERRORISM.  KAZAKH PRESIDENT 
NAZARBAYEV NOTED THE LINK BETWEEN INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 
AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY IN HIS REMARKS TO THE 
CONFERENCE, AND ALMATY RABBI ELKHANAN KOGEN WAS QUOTED IN 
THE PRESS DURING THE EVENT ACCENTING ITS ANTI-TERRORISM 
THEME. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
VATICAN DELEGATION REFLECTS POPE\'S COMMITMENT 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) THE HOLY SEE\'S HIGH-POWERED PRESENCE AT THE 
KAZAKHSTAN CONGRESS REFLECTED THE PRIORITY THE HOLY SEE 
CURRENTLY PLACES ON EXPANDING SUCH A DIALOGUE AND THEIR 
 
VATICAN 00004956  002 OF 002 
 
SITED BY THE POPE. 
THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION WAS LED BY CARDINAL JOZEF TOMKO, 
PREFECT EMERITUS OF THE CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION 
OF PEOPLES.  THE DELEGATION ALSO INCLUDED CARDINAL RENATO 
MARTINO, PRESIDENT OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE 
AND PEACE, ASTANA ARCHBISHOP TOMASZ PETA, ARCHBISHOP PIER 
LUIGI CELATA, THE NUMBER TWO IN THE VATICAN\'S COUNCIL FOR 
INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE, MONSIGNOR MAJ FROM THE COUNCIL 
FOR CHRISTIAN UNITY, AND A MONSIGNOR MARAT FROM THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY. IN HIS REMARKS, TOMKO EMPHASIZED THE SPECIFIC 
RESPONSIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO COLLABORATE TO 
ELIMINATE CAUSES OF TERRORISM, PROMOTE HUMAN DIGNITY AND 
UNITY AMONG PEOPLES.  HE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
EDUCATION IN ENSURING THAT CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS 
IDENTITIES ARE NOT PROMOTED IN OPPOSITION TO OTHERS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) THOUGH THE MEETING WAS KAZAKH-SPONSORED, THE HOLY 
SEE CAN JUSTIFIABLY CLAIM A ROLE IN ITS GENESIS, GIVEN THE 
POPE\'S PIONEERING ROLE IN DEVELOPING THIS TYPE OF 
CONFERENCE.  AS ALMATY ARCHBISHOP PETA OBSERVED, \"WE ARE 
HAPPY THAT OUR CIVIL AUTHORITIES RECOGNIZE THE POPE AS A 
MAJOR MORAL AUTHORITY AT THE WORLD LEVEL AND THAT THEY HAVE 
UNDERTAKEN THIS INITIATIVE IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT OF 
ASSISI WHERE THE FIRST INTER-RELIGIOUS MEETING FOR PEACE 
WAS HELD.\"  THE VATICAN-ASSOCIATED NGO SANT\'EGIDIO ALSO 
ORGANIZES AN ANNUAL SERIES OF INTER-RELIGIOUS MEETINGS WITH 
A SIMILAR FORMAT (REFTEL) THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A 
    NORMALIZATION OF SUCH DIALOGUES.  CATHOLIC DOCUMENTS ON 
INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE ARE SOME OF THE MOST DEVELOPED, 
AND WERE FREQUENTLY CITED DURING THE CONFERENCE.  VATICAN 
OFFICIAL HAVE TOLD US THAT EXPANDING THIS DIALOGUE IS 
CURRENTLY ONE OF THE VATICAN\'S HIGHEST INTERNATIONAL 
PRIORITIES.  WE CAN THEREFORE EXPECT THE HOLY SEE TO REMAIN 
A KEY PARTNER IN OUR EFFORT TO BUILD INTER-RELIGIOUS 
UNDERSTANDING AND DEVELOP AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE 
MUSLIM WORLD.  AS MURAT CONCLUDED, \"THERE SEEMS TO BE 
MOMENTUM ON THE ISSUE.\"  END COMMENT.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Reviewing the recent UNGA vote on the U.S. embargo on 
Cuba, the Holy See reaffirmed its opposition to the embargo, 
while affirming its distaste for the regime\'s human rights 
abuses.  MFA Caribbean Affairs Office Director Giorgio Lingua 
repeated the Vatican\'s view that the embargo is ineffective, 
and said he hoped the U.S. would change its approach on the 
issue.  While the Holy See is disappointed with the lack of 
progress on human rights and religious freedom issues almost 
six years after the 1998 papal visit to the island, Lingua 
took a long-term view in assessing the regime, noting some 
positive signs and adding that \"Castro is not immortal.\"  End 
summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
UNGA Vote: Holy See Sees Little Effect 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Poloff met November 7 with MFA Caribbean Affairs 
Office Director Giorgio Lingua to discuss the recent vote on 
U.S. embargo on Cuba at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) (ref 
A).  Lingua acknowledged the EU\'s condemnation of Cuba\'s 
human rights situation in its explanation of vote (EOV) and 
noted the Holy See\'s distaste for such abuses.  Lingua was 
nevertheless doubtful that the EU\'s statement would affect 
the overall situation.  Lingua agreed with poloff that the UN 
Resolution was simply a way for Castro to deflect attention 
from the regime\'s abuses and other ills, but insisted that 
the U.S. was playing into Castro\'s hands by giving him this 
diversion. 
 
----------------------------- 
Policy Change on the Horizon? 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Lingua noted the U.S. Congressional vote last month to 
ease travel restrictions to Cuba.  Cuba\'s isolation, he 
contended, only fortified the regime and discouraged 
compromise.  He wondered if the move might prompt the 
administration to consider a change of policy on the embargo. 
 \"Bush is a strong leader who could take this step without 
losing status,\" Lingua said.  After so many years of similar 
strategies without significant results, Lingua wondered aloud 
why the administration wouldn\'t try a new approach. 
 
-------------------- 
Upcoming Anniversary 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) Lingua also reflected on the upcoming sixth 
anniversary of Pope John Paul II\'s visit to Cuba in January, 
1998.  \"We had hoped for more by this time,\" he said, when 
assessing the current state of affairs for freedom of worship 
on the island.  While the Cuban population is perhaps 
 
 
subjected to fewer limitations on worship than it was six 
years ago, Lingua argued, this is still not freedom.  The 
Holy See was particularly troubled by the government\'s 
restrictions on Catholic publications.  Lingua said that 
Castro was using the Cuban bishops\' refusal to comply with 
the regime\'s registration requirement for publications as an 
excuse for his continued persecution of the Church -- a 
disingenuous tactic related to the leader\'s use of the 
embargo issue. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Comment: Light at the End of the Tunnel? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Lingua\'s comments reflected the Vatican\'s usual 
cautious approach to Cuba, as well as its traditional 
opposition to embargoes in general -- particulary this one. 
Overall, however, Lingua was more optimistic on Cuba than he 
has been in recent meetings (ref B,C,D), and took a long-term 
view.  \"Castro is not immortal,\" he said, noting that there 
are opposition figures in Cuba who are simply waiting for the 
right opportunity to become vocal.  He further noted that he 
saw evidence of an increased willingness on the part of Cuban 
bishops to criticize Castro,s regime in recent years. 
 
6. (C) Lingua did not foresee any upcoming Holy See 
statements on Cuba, though he noted that when a new papal 
nuncio is appointed, the occasion might present the 
opportunity for the Vatican to make mention of Castro\'s human 
rights failings.  Post will track the appointment and 
encourage the Holy See to do just that when the time comes. 
(Note: There is no word on when the new nuncio to Cuba will 
be named, but with a new Vatican foreign minister settling in 
later this month, it will likely be a few months until an 
appointment is made. End note).

1. (C) Vatican MFA Caribbean Affairs Office Director Giorgio 
Lingua said November 7 that the Holy See is \"very worried\" 
about the situation in Haiti.  He expressed concern about the 
disruption of an October 16 mass (ref a and b), and noted the 
potential for violence in the coming weeks (ref d).  Acting 
Foreign Minister Pietro Parolin emphasized in a November 13 
meeting the difficult balancing act that Vatican and 
Episcopal leadership in Haiti must perform in pressing for 
reform while avoiding instigating further violence.  He noted 
in this regard that the Haitian Episcopal Conference had 
signed on to the protest letter to the Haitian Government 
sent by the papal nuncio after the October 16 disturbance 
(ref b).  According to Lingua, the Haitian Catholic Church is 
struggling in general, with many people leaving the Church 
due to disillusionment with its handling of the Aristide 
crisis.  Though he acknowledged the challenges Aristide 
presented to those seeking reform, Lingua thought that 
pressure for increased democratic expression might be 
effective if it did not threaten Aristide\'s legitimacy.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------- 
The Vatican\'s Concern 
--------------------- 
 
2. (C) MFA Caribbean Affairs Office Director Giorgio Lingua 
told poloff November 7 that the Holy See is \"very worried\" 
about the situation in Haiti, following the disruption of the 
October 16 papal anniversary mass (ref a, b) and continuing 
violent incidents.  Lingua told us a Haitian MFA 
representative had called Papal Nuncio Luigi Bonazzi to 
express his regret for the incident at mass, but said that to 
his knowledge Aristide himself had not contacted any Vatican 
representative to comment on the incident.  Lingua expressed 
some satisfaction with news that Aristide had spoken to 
opposition leader Evans Paul after the incident, as the 
post-mass mugging of Evans Paul was also troubling to the 
Vatican.  The Holy See remains concerned about the potential 
for more violence in the lead-up to the bicentennial 
anniversary of the Battle of Vertieres on November 18 (ref d). 
 
--------------------------- 
A Church Balancing, Divided 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (C) According to Lingua, Aristide,s exploitation of some 
clergy members for propaganda purposes was taking its toll on 
the Haitian population.  Lingua said Haitians see \"a Church 
divided,\" with some clergy supporting the Lavalas party and 
others against it.  Lingua claimed this lack of solidarity 
fostered disillusionment to the point where people were 
leaving the Church in increasing numbers. 
 
4. (C) When asked if the October 16 incident might prompt the 
Holy See to raise its voice more forcefully against 
Aristide\'s abuses, Lingua was noncommittal, saying the 
Vatican needed to balance pressure on Aristide against a 
delicate security situation on the ground.  Similarly, he 
said the Haitian bishops needed to tread lightly, as 
Aristide\'s unpredictable nature made such expression 
 
 
dangerous.  Holy See Acting Foreign Minister Pietro Parolin 
reiterated this point in a November 13 meeting with the 
Charge, while also noting that the bishops had signed on to 
Nuncio Bonazzi\'s protest letter to the GOH.  According to 
Lingua, the bishops \"realize they should speak louder,\" but 
have to pick their spots carefully. 
 
-------------------- 
Episcopal Leadership 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) Lingua told us the newly-appointed archbishop of Cap 
Haitien, Hubert Constant, was similarly in a difficult 
position.  Lingua said (protect) Constant had a \"good spirit 
and pastoral character, but is conditioned by the presence -- 
in fact the omnipresence -- of Aristide.\"  Deputy FM Parolin 
was somewhat more positive on Constant, noting his role in 
protesting the October 16 incident.  On leadership in 
Port-au-Prince, Parolin confirmed that Coadjutor Bishop Serge 
Miot would succeed Archbishop Ligonde as head of the 
archdiocese when Archbishop Ligonde retires formally.  He 
also denied that Miot was too close to the Aristide camp, 
asserting that Miot, too, had played a role the post-October 
16 protest. 
 
--------------------- 
Comment: Where to go? 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) Despite Lingua\'s rather somber assessment of the 
situation, he said the Holy See believes there are some 
glimmers of hope for progress Haiti.  He said the Vatican had 
noticed signs of increased discontent within the Lavalas 
party that could contribute to prospects for future reform. 
The best bet, he believed, was for further international 
pressure, especially from the United States, for increased 
democratic expression within the country -- without directly 
challenging Aristide\'s legitimacy.  This tracks with the 
conservative approach we have seen from the Holy See in such 
situations.  The Vatican is far more likely to take the 
long-term view than to invite confrontation -- or encourage 
local bishops to do so. 
 
7. (C) When looking at the big picture, Lingua said, 
effecting change in Haiti should be easier than in Cuba. 
Unlike Castro, Lingua observed, Aristide is not ideologically 
motivated.  \"This is one person -- not a system,\" he added. 
Citing the effects on the U.S. of Haitian drug trafficking 
and illegal immigration, Lingua acknowledged the USG interest 
in Haiti, even beyond its humanitarian concerns.  Lingua 
noted with interest the arrival of Ambassador Foley in 
Port-au-Prince; consequently we passed him a copy of the 
Ambassador\'s ref E press statement.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Holy See Acting Foreign Minister Pietro Parolin 
expressed disappointment with the UN decision to postpone a 
vote on competing resolutions that propose bans on human 
cloning in a November 13 meeting with the Charge.  He 
added, however, that the Vatican was buoyed by the progress 
that had been made with international opinion on the issue, 
and would continue its efforts to convince the undecided 
and opponents of the ban.  Earlier in the week, the Pope 
reaffirmed the Vatican\'s position on stem cell research -- 
including his strong opposition to therapeutic cloning -- 
in an address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
Disappointment with Delay . . . 
------------------------------- 
 
2.(SBU) In a November 13 meeting with the Charge, Holy 
See Acting Foreign Minister Pietro Parolin expressed 
disappointment in the decision of the Legal Committee of 
the UN General Assembly (UNGA) to postpone by two years a 
vote on a global ban on the practice of reproductive and 
therapeutic cloning.  He reaffirmed the Holy See\'s 
determination to continue to work on the issue, agreeing 
ruefully when the Charge pointed out that scientific 
developments in cloning would unfortunately move ahead 
quickly over the next two years in the absence of 
international action.  Parolin said the Vatican had not yet 
mapped out a specific strategy, but would likely continue 
working to build support among Islamic countries with whom 
it had had some success in finding common ground on the 
issue, as well as among predominantly Catholic countries. 
He also thanked the U.S. for its efforts to achieve a ban 
on all human cloning, and promised continued cooperation 
from the Holy See. 
 
---------------------------------- 
. . . but Satisfaction at Progress 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Parolin emphasized that, the close vote for 
postponement notwithstanding, the Holy See was buoyed by 
the progress that had been made internationally on the 
issue, both among governments and public opinion. 
(Comment:  The Holy See had initially been doubtful that 
enough countries would come around to support a resolution 
that would also ban therapeutic cloning, but was spurred to 
support the complete ban in part by U.S. determination to 
fight for it.  End Comment.)  The Holy See\'s lobbying 
efforts on behalf of the Costa Rican draft resolution had 
generated more traction than the Vatican had expected, as 
more and more countries came out in favor a ban on both 
reproductive and therapeutic cloning. 
 
------------------------------- 
Pope Reaffirms Vatican Position 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) Earlier in the week, the Pope reaffirmed the 
Church\'s rejection of experimentation on embryonic stem 
cells (and, by implication, the therapeutic cloning which 
is often a part of such work) when he received members of 
the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in audience on November 
10.  The scientists were meeting to analyze the scientific 
and bioethical implications of stem cell technology and 
other therapies. 
 
5.  (U) In his English-language address, John Paul II 
observed: \"Research in this field has understandably grown 
 
 
in importance in recent years because of the hope it offers 
for the cure of ills affecting many people.\"  He added: \"I 
have on other occasions stated that stem cells for purposes 
of experimentation or treatment cannot come from human 
embryo tissue.  I have instead encouraged research on adult 
human tissue or tissue superfluous to normal fetal 
development.\"  Reaffirming his rejection of therapeutic 
cloning, the Pope stressed: \"Any treatment which claims to 
save human lives, yet is based upon the destruction of 
human life in its embryonic state, is logically and morally 
contradictory, as is any production of human embryos for 
the direct or indirect purpose of experimentation or 
eventual destruction.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Comment: Holy See to Continue to Press for Ban 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.  (SBU) The Holy See will use the time before UNGA\'s next 
consideration of the issue vigorously to lobby its moral 
allies on the issue (both predominantly Catholic countries 
as well as Islamic nations), and also to continue dialogue 
with states that are sympathetic to the development of 
therapeutic cloning.  The Holy See remains open to 
continuing its close collaboration with the U.S. on this 
issue, and would welcome U.S. perspectives on the way ahead 
over the next two years in light of the UN vote.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON.  REASONS:  1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
    ------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) THE HOLY SEE\'S OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR NORTH AND SOUTH 
KOREA, MONSIGNOR LUIS MONTEMAYOR, TOLD DCM NOVEMBER 18 THAT 
THE VATICAN\'S PERIODIC SENIOR LEVEL CONTACTS WITH PYONGYANG 
WERE IN SUSPENSION PENDING THE RESULTS OF THE SIX-PARTY TALKS 
ON NORTH KOREA\'S NUCLEAR ARMS PROGRAM.  THE HOLY SEE HOPED 
THAT AN EVENTUAL AGREEMENT WITH NORTH KOREA VIA THE GROUP OF 
SIX PROCESS WOULD CREATE AN OPENING FOR A RESUMPTION OF 
CONTACTS WITH THE DPRK.  IN PAST CONTACTS, THE HOLY SEE HAS 
FOCUSED NARROWLY ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND HUMANITARIAN RELIEF 
WORK THROUGH CARITAS, BOTH AIMED AT CREATING A SMALL SPACE 
FOR THE GROWTH OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP THAT COULD EVENTUALLY 
HAVE A SPIN OFF ON OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
FEAR OF CHURCH DESPITE LACK OF FAITHFUL 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) MONTEMAYOR EMPHASIZED THAT THE DPRK GOVERNMENT 
REMAINED WARY OF THE VATICAN, EVEN THOUGH THE CHURCH PRESENCE 
OVER TIME AND THROUGH PERSECUTION HAD BECOME VIRTUALLY 
NONEXISTENT IN NORTH KOREA.  THE NORTH KOREANS FEAR THE U.S. 
MOST OF CALL,\" MONTEMAYOR OBSERVED, BUT THEY ARE ALSO 
TERRIFIED OF THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF RELIGION -- AND OF 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN PARTICULAR WHICH CONTINUES TO GROW 
RAPIDLY IN SOUTH KOREA. 
 
3. (C) MONTEMAYOR POINTED OUT THAT THERE WAS NO 
    ECCLESIASTICAL STRUCTURE IN NORTH KOREA, EVEN THOUGH THERE 
MAY BE SCATTERED BAPTIZED CATHOLICS STILL LIVING.  THE HOLY 
SEE IS NOT AWARE OF ANY LIVING CLERGY MEMBERS IN THE COUNTRY, 
AND NOTES THAT THE FATE OF THE LAST BISHOP OF PYONGYANG, HONG 
YONG-HO HAS REMAINED A MYSTERY SINCE 1962.  HE IS STILL KEPT 
IN THE VATICAN BOOKS AS THE BISHOP, WITH A NOTE THAT HIS 
WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN.  WHEN THE VATICAN HAS ASKED ABOUT 
INDIVIDUAL CLERGY MEMBERS, THE DPRK GOVERNMENT HAS TOLD THE 
VATICAN THAT ALL THE CATHOLICS WERE KILLED BY AMERICAN 
BOMBING DURING THE WAR, WHICH THEY INSIST TARGETED CHURCHES. 
IN FACT, MONTEMAYOR NOTED, MANY NORTH KOREAN CATHOLICS FLED 
TO THE SOUTH DURING THE KOREAN WAR, AND THERE IS STILL A 
PRESENCE OF NORTH KOREAN CATHOLICS THERE.  THIS FACTOR, AND 
THE STRENGTH OF THE SOUTH KOREAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, IS ENOUGH 
TO PRESENT A THREAT TO THE PARANOID PYONGYANG GOVERNMENT, 
WHICH HAS RESISTED VATICAN EFFORTS TO REESTABLISH ANY 
ECCLESIASTICAL STRUCTURE. 
 
-------------------------- 
POSITIONING FOR THE FUTURE 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C) AS IT NOW STANDS, THE ARCHBISHOP OF SEOUL SERVES AS 
APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATOR FOR PYONGYANG.  THIS IRRITATES THE 
NORTH KOREANS, WHO GRATE AT THE IDEA OF BEING IN ANY WAY 
SUBORDINATED TO AN ORGANIZATION IN SEOUL.  TO AVOID THIS 
\'IGNOMINY\' THE HOLY SEE HAS OFFERED TO ESTABLISH A BISHOP FOR 
PYONGYANG WITH HIS OWN STRUCTURE, BUT THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE 
YET TO TAKE THE BAIT.  IF ANY MODEST OPENING COULD BE 
ACHIEVED IN NORTH KOREA, THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE VERY WELL 
POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT, DRAWING ON THEIR STRONG 
    AND GROWING CHURCH STRUCTURE IN SOUTH KOREA.  AS MONTEMAYOR 
OBSERVED WITH A WRY SMILE, \"THIS IS ONE CASE WHERE WE HAVE 
PRIESTS IN ABUNDANCE -- AND THEY SPEAK THE LANGUAGE.\" 
 
5. (C) MONTEMAYOR SAID THAT HE AND VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN 
MINISTER MONSIGNOR PIETRO PAROLIN WOULD LIKELY RESUME 
CONTACTS NEXT YEAR - IDEALLY AFTER A AGREEMENT HAD BEEN 
ACHIEVED LEADING TO THE DISMANTLEMENT OF NORTH KOREA\'S 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS.  PAROLIN\'S PREDECESSOR, ARCHBISHOP 
MIGLIORE, VISITED PYONGYANG FIVE TIMES TO KEEP A LINE OF 
COMMUNICATION OPEN.  AT THE SAME TIME, MONTEMAYOR 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE VATICAN\'S DIFFICULTIES IN TRYING TO OPEN UP 
SPACE FOR RELIGIOUS PRACTICE IN THE REPRESSIVE REGIME.  FOR 
THE TIME BEING, THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL 
AID TO THROUGH CARITAS INTERNATIONAL AND AFFILIATED 
CHARITIES, WHILE ENSURING THIS AID WOULD NOT BE FUNNELED TO 
THE DPRK GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY (REF. A).  IN ADDITION, THE 
HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE PERSONAL CONTACT 
BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH TO THE LIMITED EXTENT POSSIBLE.

1. (C) POLOFF DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS TO HOLY SEE OFFICE 
DIRECTOR FOR ISRAEL AND PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS FRANCO COPPOLA 
NOVEMBER 25.  COPPOLA LIMITED HIS RESPONSE TO THE POSSIBILITY 
    OF AN INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) OPINION ON THE 
LEGALITY OF THE ISRAELI SEPARATION BARRIER.  HE AGREED THAT 
SEEKING AN ICJ OPINION WOULD BE A MISTAKE THAT WOULD RISK 
POLITICIZING THE ICJ, AND IN GENERAL WOULD COMPLICATE THE 
SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
 
2. (C) COPPOLA SAID THE HOLY SEE APPRECIATED AND WELCOMED THE 
PRESIDENT\'S SIGNIFICANT NOVEMBER 19 COMMENTS IN LONDON 
REGARDING THE WAY FORWARD IN THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN DISPUTE 
(REF A).  HE POINTEDLY NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE COMMENTS 
SEEMED TO HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. 
THE HOLY SEE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE GOI MAY IN FACT NOW BE 
SPEEDING UP CONSTRUCTION OF THE BARRIER.  IF THE GOI DOES NOT 
RESPOND EVEN TO THE U.S. CRITICISM, COPPOLA OBSERVED, PERHAPS 
SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE NEEDED TO BE DONE. 
 
3. (C) THE HOLY SEE\'S CONCERN ABOUT THE SECURITY FENCE -- AS 
HIGHLIGHTED BY THE POPE\'S POINTED REMARKS IN HIS LAST SUNDAY 
ANGELUS ADDRESS (REF B) -- WAS THAT THE FURTHER ALONG THE 
BARRIER PROJECT WENT, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO 
REVERSE IT.  THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THE PROJECT WILL ONLY 
SERVE TO EMPOWER EXTREMISTS, AND WILL ONLY HINDER THE PEACE 
PROCESS.  THE ICJ IS NOT THE ANSWER, COPPOLA AGREED, BUT WE 
MUST FIND ANOTHER WAY.

COMMENT

4. (C) THE POPE\'S UNUSUAL DIRECT AND PUBLIC CRITICISM OF THE 
SECURITY WALL EVOKED A SHARP RESPONSE FROM PRIME MINISTER 
    SHARON DURING HIS VISIT TO ITALY LAST WEEK IN WHICH HE NOTED 
THAT HE COULD NOT HELP BUT NOTICE THAT THE VATICAN WAS 
SURROUNDED BY WALLS.  THERE HAD BEEN PRESS SPECULATION ABOUT 
WHETHER SHARON WOULD MEET WITH THE POPE DURING HIS THREE DAYS 
IN ROME, BUT THE POPE\'S CRITICISM DIMMED ANY PROSPECTS FOR 
SUCH A MEETING.  WE HAVE HEARD THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL 
AND THE HOLY SEE ARE AT A LOW POINT -- AN IMPRESSION 
REINFORCED BY SHARON\'S\' STUDIOUS AVOIDANCE OF VATICAN CITY 
DURING HIS VISIT AND BY ISRAEL\'S DOWNSIZING OF ITS MISSION TO 
THE HOLY SEE IN RECENT MONTHS.  COPPOLA\'S CALL FOR SOMETHING 
BEYOND EXHORTATION TO ISRAEL IS A REFLECTION OF THE HOLY 
SEE\'S MOUNTING FRUSTRATION BOTH WITH THE CONTINUING CYCLE OF 
VIOLENCE AND ISRAELI POLICY ON THE BARRIER AND SETTLEMENTS.

1.  SUMMARY:  CARE AND TREATMENT FOR SUFFERERS OF HIV/AIDS 
AND FIDELITY AND ABSTINENCE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE 
DISEASE WERE THE HOLY SEE\'S KEY MESSAGES FOR WORLD AIDS DAY 
2003.  IN A STATEMENT DELIVERED NOVEMBER 30, POPE JOHN PAUL 
II LAMENTED THE CONTINUED SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, \"ESPECIALLY 
IN THE POOREST OF COUNTRIES\" AND ENCOURAGED CATHOLICS TO 
OFFER HOSPITALITY, CARE AND SPIRITUAL SUPPORT TO VICTIMS OF 
    HIV/AIDS.  IN A SEPARATE MESSAGE, THE HOLY SEE\'S HEALTH 
MINISTER EQUIVALENT, CARDINAL JAVIER LOZANO BARRAGAN, 
CALLED FOR GREATER ACCESS BOTH TO GENERIC MEDICINES TO 
FIGHT AIDS-RELATED OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND TO 
MEDICINES TO HELP CONTROL THE DISEASE ITSELF.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  CARDINAL BARRAGAN SAID THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND CIVIL 
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD PROMOTE EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS THAT \"FAVOR 
THE CULTURE OF LIFE AND RESPONSIBLE LOVE.\"  BARRAGAN ALSO 
URGED AN INCREASE IN PROGRAMS TO MEET THE HUMANITARIAN, 
SOCIAL AND HEALTH NEEDS OF THE INCREASING NUMBER OF 
CHILDREN LEFT ORPHANED BY AIDS.  HE SAID EVERY FORM OF 
EXCLUSION, DISCRIMINATION OR STIGMATIZATION OF HIV/AIDS 
SUFFERS MUST BE AVOIDED, AND EXPRESSED PARTICULAR CONCERN 
FOR PRISON INMATES.  THE CARDINAL ANNOUNCED THAT HIS 
DICASTERY WAS PREPARING A HANDBOOK FOR CHURCH WORKERS ON 
HIV/AIDS IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS 
ORDERS, INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE ABOUT 25 
PERCENT OF ALL SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AND 19 PERCENT OF HEALTH 
CARE WORLDWIDE TO PEOPLE WITH HIV/AIDS. 
 
3.CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS, A FEDERATION OF CATHOLIC 
RELIEF AGENCIES, HAS CALLED ON ITS 162 MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS 
TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE THE STIGMA AND 
DISCRIMINATION ASSOCIATED WITH HIV/AIDS.  CARITAS 
INTERNATIONALIS IS THE ONLY NON-UN ORGANIZATION WITH A 
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH UNAIDS, AND HAS FOR MANY 
YEARS HAS ORGANIZED SEMINARS FOR BISHOPS, CLERGY, AND LAY 
PEOPLE TO PROMOTE GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PANDEMIC. 
CARITAS AND UNAIDS HAVE PLEDGED TO WORK TOGETHER, FROM 
THEIR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, TO PROMOTE AWARENESS, 
    ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE, TO PREVENT NEW INFECTIONS, 
ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS OF THOSE INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS, 
AND ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION AT ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY. 
 
4.COMMENT:  THE HOLY SEE AND ITS RELATED ORGANIZATIONS 
WORLDWIDE CONTINUE TO BE KEY PLAYERS IN THE CARE AND 
TREATMENT OF PERSONS WITH HIV/AIDS (REFTELS A AND B).  MANY 
OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW TAKING UP ADVOCACY WORK 
AIMED AT BUILDING INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS TO 
COMBAT HIV/AIDS AND AT ENDING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
HIV/AIDS VICTIMS AT ALL SOCIAL LEVELS.  HOLY SEE PREVENTION 
STRATEGIES ARE FOCUSED ON PREMARITAL ABSTINENCE AND 
FAITHFULNESS WITHIN MARRIAGE.  RECENT MEDIA CRITICISM OF 
THE HOLY SEE\'S OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF CONDOMS AS AN 
EFFECTIVE MEANS OF PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF INFECTION HAS 
DETRACTED ATTENTION FROM ITS BROAD AND EFFECTIVE WORLDWIDE 
DEPLOYMENT OF CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES AND MANPOWER TO COMBAT 
THE AIDS PANDEMIC.  END COMMENT.

COMMUNITY WITH 800,000 MEMBERS IN IRAQ, AND ANOTHER 500,000 
    MEMBERS LIVING IN IRAN, SYRIA, LEBANON, EGYPT, TURKEY  AND 
THE UNITED STATES, HE WILL BE AN IMPORTANT VOICE FOR 
RELIGIOUS MODERATION IN IRAQ.  THE PATRIARCH\'S ELECTION IN 
ROME FOLLOWS A DEADLOCKED VOTE IN SEPTEMBER, IN WHICH NEITHER 
AMERICAN BISHOP, SARHAD JAMMO OF SAN DIEGO NOR SYRIAN BISHOP 
ANTOINE AUDO, WERE ABLE TO SECURE A MAJORITY.  DELLY, THE 
EMINENCE GRISE OF THE CHALDEAN BISHOPS, EMERGED AS A 
COMPROMISE CANDIDATE BEING FROM IRAQ AND SPEAKING THE SYRIAC 
LANGUAGE OF THE CHALDEANS.  FOLLOWING THE ELECTION, THE POPE 
URGED IRAQI CATHOLICS TO \"WORK TO JOIN FORCES WITH ALL 
BELIEVERS IN RESPECTFUL DIALOGUE, WHICH WILL FAVOR THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF A STABLE AND FREE SOCIETY\" IN IRAQ. 
 
----------------------------- 
GRATEFUL FOR SADDAM\'S REMOVAL 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) AT A MEETING IN VATICAN CITY DECEMBER 5 AND A 
SUBSEQUENT BREAKFAST AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE DECEMBER 
8, THE NEW PATRIARCH CONVEYED TO THE AMBASSADOR HIS GRATITUDE 
FOR SADDAM\'S REMOVAL FROM POWER AND FOR \"BRINGING FREEDOM TO 
MY COUNTRY.\"  WITH SADDAM GONE, HE NOW HAD HIGH HOPES FOR 
IRAQ\'S FUTURE.  THE PATRIARCH ACKNOWLEDGED THAT LIFE IN IRAQ 
UNDER SADDAM HAD BEEN DIFFICULT.  EVEN THOUGH SADDAM HAD 
GIVEN THE CHALDEAN CHURCH A DEGREE OF FREEDOM TO CARRY OUT 
ITS RELIGIOUS MISSION, THE CHURCH ALWAYS HAD TO BE CAREFUL, 
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE FIRST GULF WAR WHEN SADDAM BEGAN TO 
PLAY MORE UPON MUSLIM, ANTI-WESTERN SENTIMENTS.  HIS 
SENTIMENTS WERE ECHOED BY MANY OTHER CHALDEAN BISHOPS PRESENT 
AT THE TWO MEETINGS, INCLUDING BISHOP KASSAB OF BASRA, BISHOP 
SHLEMON WARDUNI, THE OUTSPOKEN AUXILIARY OF BAGHDAD, AND 
    BISHOP IBRAHIM IBRAHIM OF DETROIT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
NEED TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY ON ESSENTIAL SERVICES 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (C) THE PATRIARCH\'S MAIN MESSAGE TO THE U.S. WAS THE NEED 
TO \"WORK MORE QUICKLY IN EVERY RESPECT\" -- PARTICULARLY IN 
IMPROVING ESSENTIAL SERVICES.  HE NOTED THAT IRAQIS HAD 
INITIALLY WELCOMED THE U.S. FORCES BECAUSE THE BELIEVED THEIR 
ARRIVAL WOULD BRING A BETTER LIFE.  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS EARLY 
ENTHUSIASM HAD GIVEN WAY TO GROWING DOUBTS AS PEOPLE FOUND 
THAT THEY HAD LOST MANY BASIC SERVICES SUCH AS DEPENDABLE 
ELECTRICITY THAT THEY HAD HAD UNDER SADDAM.  THE IRAQI 
PEOPLE\'S WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH U.S. FORCES -- WHICH 
THE PATRIARCH BELIEVED WAS THE KEY TO BETTER SECURITY -- 
WOULD DEPEND ON WHETHER THEY FELT THE U.S. PRESENCE WAS 
BRINGING THEM IMPROVED LIVING CONDITIONS.  HE NOTED HE HAD 
TOLD CPA HEAD BREMER THAT IF THE U.S. BROUGHT IN A FEW 
THOUSAND GENERATORS, THEY WOULD GENERATE ENORMOUS GOODWILL. 
THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THE MANY POSITIVE CHANGES THAT 
 
VATICAN 00005521  002.1 OF 003 
 
NFRASTRUCTURE 
IMPROVEMENT THAT WOULD GIVE IRAQ A MODERN, EFFICIENT 
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE LONG TERM. 
 
----------------------------- 
    SECURITY:  BORDERS TOO POROUS 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (C) THE PATRIARCH TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE SECURITY 
PROBLEMS IN IRAQ WERE NOT CAUSED BY IRAQIS -- WITH THE 
POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF LINGERING SADDAM LOYALISTS -- BUT BY 
FOREIGN TERRORISTS FROM SYRIA, SAUDI ARABIA, AND ELSEWHERE IN 
THE REGION WHO WERE INFILTRATING IRAQ THROUGH ITS POROUS 
BORDERS.  IN THIS REGARD, HE URGED THE U.S TO DO MORE TO 
PROTECT THE BORDERS BOTH AT CROSSINGS AS WELL AS THROUGH 
AERIAL SURVEILLANCE.  ASKED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SADDAM\'S 
CAPTURE ON STABILITY IN THE COUNTRY, THE PATRIARCH AND OTHER 
IRAQI BISHOPS SAID IT WOULD BE WELCOME, BUT BECAUSE THE 
PROBLEMS CAME PREDOMINANTLY FROM OUTSIDE, THEY BELIEVED IT 
WOULD NOT END THE INSECURITY.  REGARDING THE THREAT FROM 
SADDAM LOYALISTS WITHIN THE SUNNI TRIANGLE, THE BISHOPS 
BELIEVED THAT SADDAM ALWAYS HAD A SURVIVAL PLAN READY TO 
FIGHT AGAINST INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL FOES, AND WAS NOW DRAWING 
ON LONG-HIDDEN WEAPONS STASHES. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
ROUNDING UP WEAPONS:  USE CASH NOT SEARCHES 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF THE EXCESS WEAPONS 
CIRCULATING IN IRAQ, THE PATRIARCH RECOMMENDED THAT THE U.S. 
DEVELOP A PROGRAM TO PAY PEOPLE FOR WEAPONS RATHER THAN 
CONDUCT SEARCHES AND SEIZURES THROUGH IRAQI HOUSES.  HE 
OBSERVED THAT THE IMAGES OF U.S. SOLDIERS BANGING DOWN DOORS 
AND ROUSING FAMILIES FROM THEIR SLEEP WAS GENERATING A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ILL WILL AND WAS \"THE WRONG APPROACH.\" 
    HE ALSO URGED THE U.S. TO MOVE AHEAD RAPIDLY TO PROVIDE JOBS 
TO PEOPLE THAT WOULD PUT CASH IN THEIR POCKETS AND MAKE THEM 
LESS LIKELY TO TURN TO ARMED OPPOSITION.  HE SUGGESTED EVEN A 
SMALL CASH STIPEND FOR EACH FAMILY WOULD CURRY MUCH FAVOR. 
 
---------------------------------- 
INTER-RELIGIOUS RELATIONS ON TRACK 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) THE PATRIARCH TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE CHALDEAN 
LEADERSHIP\'S RELATIONS WITH BOTH THE SHIITE AND SUNNI 
LEADERSHIP WERE \"VERY GOOD\" AND THAT HE HAD \"GREAT 
CONFIDENCE\" FOR THE FUTURE OF INTER-RELIGIOUS RELATIONS IN 
THE COUNTRY.  ALL FAITHS HAD CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST ACTIONS, 
HE ADDED.  THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THERE WERE MANY \"FANATICAL 
MULLAHS\" WHO OFTEN TOOK TO LABELING IRAQI CHRISTIANS AS 
INFIDELS.  THERE HAD BEEN SOME INCIDENTS OF RETRIBUTIONS 
AGAINST CHRISTIANS, WITH 5-6 CHALDEANS KILLED AND SHOPS 
SELLING ALCOHOL BURNED, BUT IN GENERAL, THE CHALDEAN 
COMMUNITY CONTINUED TO BE ACCEPTED WITHIN IRAQ.  THE 
PATRIARCH\'S FEAR IS THAT SHOULD IRAQ BECOME AN ISLAMIC STATE, 
THEY COULD FIND THEIR CURRENT FREEDOMS SEVERELY RESTRICTED. 
FOR THE TIME BEING, HOWEVER, HE FELT THAT IT WAS A TESTIMONY 
TO THE DEEPLY ROOTED IRAQI TRADITIONS OF INTER-RELIGIONS 
ACCEPTANCE THAT SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE END OF THE WAR, IN A 
SITUATION WITH ALMOST NO POLICE OR PUBLIC ORDER, THERE HAD 
BEEN SO FEW RELIGIOUS PROBLEMS OR ACTS OF RELIGIOUS ATTACKS. 
 
------------------------- 
LIBERATION OR OCCUPATION? 
------------------------- 

8. (C) REITERATING THAT THE KEY TO A BETTER SECURITY 
SITUATION WAS GETTING THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ TO COOPERATE WITH 
U.S. FORCES, THE PATRIARCH OBSERVED THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME 
SENSITIVITY AMONG IRAQIS THAT THE U.S. HAD GONE FROM BEING 
LIBERATORS TO OCCUPIERS. THE DISTINCTION WAS A CRITICAL ONE, 
HE EMPHASIZED.  UNFORTUNATELY, THERE HAD BEEN A MEETING WITH 
A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL IN WHICH THE OFFICIAL STATED THAT THE 
U.S. WAS IN FACT NOW \"OCCUPYING\" IRAQ, A STATEMENT THAT 
PROMPTED A NUMBER OF OTHER RELIGIOUS FIGURES TO LEAVE THE 
MEETING.  TO BUILD SUPPORT AMONG IRAQIS, HE CAUTIONED, THE 
U.S. SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO COUNTER THE IMAGE OF 
OCCUPATION.  THE AMBASSADOR ASSURED THE PATRIARCH THAT THE 
U.S. GOAL WAS TO TURN POWER OVER TO A LEGITIMATE IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, WHILE ENSURING A STABLE AND 
SECURE FUTURE. 
 
9. (C) MONSIGNOR PHILIP NAJIM, THE CHALDEANS REPRESENTATIVE 
IN ROME AND A FREQUENT COMMENTATOR ON IRAQI DEVELOPMENTS FOR 
ITALIAN TELEVISION, EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING A 
BETTER RAPPORT AND GREATER CONFIDENCE BETWEEN U.S. FORCES AND

BETTER RAPPORT AND GREATER CONFIDENCE BETWEEN U.S. FORCES AND 
 
VATICAN 00005521  003 OF 003 
 
AND BARBED WIRE.  HE 
RECOGNIZED THE PREDICAMENT FACED BY TROOPS WHO SOUGHT TO WORK 
WITH THE IRAQI PEOPLE ONLY TO FIND THEMSELVES AMBUSHED AND 
ATTACKED, AND ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WAS NO EASY WAY TO SQUARE 
THIS CIRCLE.  THE CHALDEAN ARCHBISHOP OF DETROIT IBRAHIM 
    IBRAHIM INSISTED THAT IRAQIS \"LOVED\" THE U.S., BUT WERE NOT 
COOPERATING BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID AND BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT 
YET SEEN THE BENEFITS OF COOPERATION.  THE FREEDOM TO SAY 
WHATEVER THEY WANT DOES NOT GO FAR, HE CAUTIONED, IF PEOPLE 
ARE UNABLE TO WORK, LACK ESSENTIALS, AND ARE AFRAID TO GO OUT 
OR SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
GOVERNANCE: FOCUS ON REGIONS, AVOID NEPOTISM 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) TURNING TO IRAQ\'S POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, THE 
PATRIARCH OBSERVED THAT IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE 
TO HAVE SO MUCH LIBERTY AND FREEDOM IMMEDIATELY AFTER 30 
YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.  HE NEVERTHELESS FELT THAT THE 
REGIONAL COUNCILS WERE FUNCTIONING WELL, AND REPRESENTED ONE 
OF THE MORE POSITIVE POST-WAR DEVELOPMENTS.  HE CAUTIONED 
THAT THE U.S. HAD GIVEN TOO MUCH WEIGHT TO POLITICAL PARTIES 
-- MANY WITH ROOTS OUTSIDE IRAQ -- RATHER THAN WORKING ON A 
PROVINCIAL BASIS, WHICH HE BELIEVED WOULD BE MORE 
REPRESENTATIVE.  HE ALSO CAUTIONED AGAINST \"GIVING TOO MUCH 
TO THE SHIITES, NOTING THAT WITH 13 OF THE 25 SEATS ON THE 
GOVERNING COUNCIL THEY COULD PUSH THROUGH ANYTHING THEY 
WANTED.  THE PATRIARCH APPEALED TO THE AMBASSADOR TO CONVEY 
HIS REQUEST THAT THE CHALDEANS BE ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED ON 
CONSTITUTIONAL DRAFTING COMMITTEES. 
 
11. (C) AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEETING, THE PATRIARCH AND 
HIS FELLOW BISHOPS REITERATED THEIR STRONG CONCERN ABOUT 
NEPOTISM WITHIN THE DEVELOPING IRAQI ADMINISTRATION.  THEY 
NOTED THAT THE NEW PETROLEUM MINISTER WAS THE SON OF A MEMBER 
    OF THE GOVERNING COUNCIL, AND SAID THIS WAS A PATTERN THAT 
WOULD LOOK TO PEOPLE JUST LIKE THE DAYS OF SADDAM.  TO BE 
CREDIBLE, IT WOULD BE VITAL FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO HAVE 
THE BEST PEOPLE AVAILABLE, NOT A NETWORK OF CRONIES. 
 
-------------------------------- 
THE FIGHT AGAINST TERROR IN IRAQ 
-------------------------------- 
 
12. (C)  MONSIGNOR NAJIM WAS SHARPLY CRITICAL OF U.S. 
STATEMENTS SUGGESTING THAT THE U.S. WAS FIGHTING TERRORISTS 
IN IRAQ RATHER THAN FIGHTING THEM IN THE UNITED STATES.  HE 
SAID THESE STATEMENTS CREATED THE IMPRESSION THAT THE U.S. 
CARED SO LITTLE FOR IRAQ THAT IT WAS WILLING TO TURN IRAQ 
INTO A TERRORIST BATTLEFIELD.  HE BELIEVED SUCH STATEMENTS 
WERE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO U.S. EFFORTS TO BUILD SUPPORT AMONG 
THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  THE CHALDEAN BISHOPS ALSO TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT IF THE U.S. WANTED PEACE IN THE BROADER 
MIDDLE EAST REGION, ITS POLICY TOWARD ISRAEL WOULD HAVE TO BE 
REVIEWED, AS IT GENERATED CONTINUING ILL-WILL.  THE 
AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT U.S. POLICY, CONTRARY TO POPULAR 
PERCEPTIONS, WAS BALANCED AND EVEN FORWARD-LEANING TO THE 
PALESTINIANS, CALLING FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR THE CREATION OF 
A PALESTINIAN STATE, AS WELL AS AN END TO SETTLEMENT 
ACTIVITY, AND FURTHER ISRAELI STEPS TO IMPROVE PALESTINIAN 
LIVING CONDITIONS.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
    13. (C) THE PATRIARCH HAD HIGH PRAISE FOR CPA HEAD BREMER, 
WHO HE SAID HAD BEEN OPEN AND ATTENTIVE TO CHALDEAN CONCERNS. 
 WHILE HE UNDERSTANDS THE OBSTACLES INVOLVED IN IMPROVING 
ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND SECURITY, HE REITERATED HIS DESIRE FOR 
THE CPA TO MOVE MORE RAPIDLY IN ALL AREAS TO IMPROVE THE 
DAILY LIFE FOR IRAQIS.  OVERALL, WE FOUND THE NEW PATRIARCH 
TO BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE U.S. DECISION TO GO INTO IRAQ, 
BUT CONCERNED THAT POPULAR DISSATISFACTION OVER THE SLOW PACE 
OF IMPROVEMENT TO THEIR DAILY LIVES HAD UNDERMINED THE IRAQI 
APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. ACTION.  THE PATRIARCH, AND HIS 
FELLOW CHALDEAN BISHOPS, GREATLY APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO MEET WITH THE AMBASSADOR AND PROMISED TO KEEP IN CLOSE 
CONTACT WHEN THEY RETURN TO THE VATICAN.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) In a December 3 meeting, Vatican Office Director for 
China Gianfranco Rota-Graziosi was pessimistic on prospects 
for progress on human rights and religious freedom in China. 
He noted continuing persecution of both the underground 
Catholic Church and the government-controlled Catholic 
Patriotic Association (CPA), and said the Vatican finds it 
hard to keep up to date with the frequent arrests of 
Catholics.  The Holy See has no plans for a change in 
strategy toward China, and Rota-Graziosi mentioned in this 
regard the Vatican\'s low-key approach to the Dalai Lama and 
its differences with the activist, U.S.-based Cardinal Kung 
Foundation.  Despite his predictions of limited progress, 
Rota-Graziosi called for continuing U.S. and international 
pressure on China to abide by international human rights 
agreements and norms on religious freedom.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Persecution of State-Sponsored Church... 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a December 3 meeting with Poloff, Vatican Office 
Director for China Gianfranco Rota-Graziosi saw little cause 
of optimism regarding human rights and religious freedom in 
China.  He noted continuing persecution of both the 
underground Catholic Church and the state-supervised Catholic 
Patriotic Association (CPA).  In fact, Rota-Graziosi said, he 
felt in many ways conditions were deteriorating, even for the 
CPA community.  In addition to manipulation of CPA bishops, 
elections and state control over seminaries, each CPA bishop 
essentially lived under house arrest, according to 
Rota-Graziosi, with a government &aide8 always at his side, 
attending all of his meetings and reporting to the 
government.  On the positive side, Rota-Graziosi did note 
more opportunities for CPA seminarians to study abroad. 
 
---------------------------- 
...and Underground Catholics 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Rota-Graziosi\'s reaction to media reports of recent 
arrests of underground Church members was muted.  He said 
that such arrests were so commonplace that it was difficult 
to keep track of them.  According to Rota-Graziosi, all 
underground bishops were currently being detained in some 
way.  Some were in prison, some kept in police houses, and 
still others had had no contact with the Holy See for two to 
four years.  The Holy See had not set out to develop the 
underground Church, he noted.  The goal had always been and 
would always be to have a unified Church out in the open -- a 
\"visible sign\" for all people.  Given China\'s political 
situation, however, the Vatican had to live with the 
realities of the split Catholic Church in China for the time 
being. 
 
------------------------ 
Cardinal Kung Foundation 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Rota-Graziosi allowed that the publicizing of 
religious freedom abuses in China by the U.S.-based Cardinal 
Kung Foundation was helpful.  But he noted that the NGO had 
no working relationship with the Vatican.  The Kung 
Foundation focuses its advocacy efforts on the underground 
Church and disagrees with the Vatican\'s strategy of promoting 
reconciliation between the official and state-run churches. 
According to Rota-Graziosi, the Foundation favors a more 
aggressive approach than the Holy See can take.  Despite 
serious disagreements, he acknowledged the importance of the 
voice the Kung Foundation gave to those suffering in the 
underground Church. 
 
----------------------------------- 
No Change of Approach on Dalai Lama 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) We turned next to the recent meeting between the 
Pope and the Dalai Lama, which was downplayed in official 
Vatican media and referred to as merely &a religious 
courtesy call8 by the Vatican spokesman.  Rota-Graziosi told 
us that the Vatican &doesn\'t want to make trouble8  with 
China or complicate China\'s relationship with the Dalai Lama 
on such occasions, but added that the treatment of the visit 
was consistent with that of previous meetings.  He said the 
Pope always receives the Dalai Lama as a religious leader, 
rather than a politician-in-exile. 
 
------------------------- 
Continued Pressure Needed 
------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Rota-Graziosi was unaware of the most recent 
developments in the EU-China dialogue on human rights (ref 
a), but called for continuing pressure by the international 
community -- and especially the U.S. -- on China to live up 
to international commitments and norms for human rights and 
religious freedom.  He cautioned the U.S. against intervening 
on specific religious freedom cases, lest such efforts 
produce a government backlash; however, he said he did not 
think China was feeling too much international pressure in 
general at the moment. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Comment: Pessimism Rules the Day 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Rota-Graziosi\'s outlook was more pessimistic than 
views we have heard recently from other Holy See officials 
(ref b).  He sees few options for Vatican action in China. 
\"Anything we do in China is 50 percent advantage, 50 percent 
disadvantage,\" he said.  If the Holy See pushes harder for 
religious freedom, there is likely to be a backlash; if it 
stays mute, then more Catholics will be persecuted under a 
veil of silence.  Fretting about a communist mentality that 
had taken generations to develop, he said it would take 
\"generations, or even centuries\" to change it.  Further, he 
said, the Holy See is simply not a presence in the lives of 
Chinese Catholics -- or Asians in general -- as it is in the 
West, thus limiting the Vatican\'s potential impact.  He did 
not expect concrete improvement stemming from the informal 
trip last summer of Washington Cardinal McCarrick to China 
(ref c).  Rota-Graziosi\'s outlook, perhaps jaded by the 
dashed expectations of the past couple of years when repeated 
hints of openings have brought no significant change from the 
PRC, will likely have an influence on the thinking of new 
Vatican Foreign Minister Lajolo, who comes to his post 
without substantial Asian experience (ref d), but who regards 
the relationship with China as one of his top four priorities.

Summary

1. (C) In a December 12 meeting, A/S Burns told the Holy 
See\'s new Foreign Minister Giovanni Lajolo that the U.S. saw 
an opportunity to move the Middle East peace process forward 
in the face of anger and frustration on both sides.  Lajolo 
expressed the Holy See\'s support for the Road Map, noting 
that both sides need to recognize that the Road Map is a 
process, not a final resolution.  Burns outlined U.S. 
concerns about the route of Israel\'s security fence, and 
Lajolo, in turn, said he has told the Israeli Ambassador that 
the security fence was having a negative effect on world 
opinion.  On Iraq, Burns emphasized the considerable economic 
and social progress achieved by the Coalition, and reviewed 
the process ahead for a political transition.  Lajolo also 
inquired about Syria and Iran, with Burns noting problems 
posed by both governments and our efforts to encourage 
greater cooperation to deal with terrorism and remove the 
nuclear threat from Iran.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Opportunity to Move Peace Process 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Assistant Secretary Bill Burns, in Rome to attend the 
meeting of major donors to the Palestinians, met with new 
Vatican Secretary for Relations with States Giovanni Lajolo 
to outline U.S. priorities for the Middle East -- which 
Lajolo considers the Holy See\'s top international priority 
(reftel).  Burns told Lajolo that despite the anger and 
frustration on both sides, there is an opportunity to press 
both Israel and the Palestinians to take steps needed to 
reinvigorate the Road Map.  President Bush, Burns emphasized, 
is committed to the Road Map, which calls for obligations on 
both sides: for the Palestinians to stop terror and violence 
and for Israel to halt settlement activity and improve 
conditions for Palestinians.  Regarding Israel\'s security 
fence, Burns observed that the issue for the U.S. was not the 
fact of the barrier, but its course and whether it prejudges 
a final settlement.  Moreover, he pointed out that it has the 
practical effect of making living conditions for many 
Palestinians even more difficult.  Burns noted that the U.S. 
has had \"intense private discussions \" with Israel on the 
issue. 
 
3. (C) Archbishop Lajolo emphasized the Holy See\'s continued 
support for the Road Map, observing \"we want it to be a 
success.\"  At the same time, he said the parties needed to 
recognize that it was \"just a road, not a final answer.\"  On 
the security fence, Lajolo observed that he had recently told 
Israel\'s Ambassador to the Holy See that the barrier was 
having a negative impact on international public opinion 
toward Israel.  While Lajolo acknowledged that the barrier 
had a different objective from the Berlin Wall -- keeping 
threats out rather than people in -- he said that the public 
perception was the same.  The Israeli Ambassador, according 
to Lajolo, had responded that Israel was more concerned by 
the security of its people than its image, to which Lajolo 
countered that the two were related.  For the Holy See, 
Lajolo observed, the wall itself was an issue, not just its 
location. 
 
4. (C) Lajolo believed that the most pressing need was to 
\"silence the weapons\" for a while so that people can recall 
how different life could be without conflict.  People on both 
sides, he added, needed to see political hope combined with 
movement toward a long-term resolution.  In this regard, 
Lajolo asked Burns whether the U.S. believed Arafat was 
capable of stopping the terror.  Burns responded that there 
is no doubt Arafat could do more.  The U.S. recognizes that 
neither Arafat nor any one individual can ensure a 100 
percent end to terror.  Still, more effective Palestinian 
actions would give the U.S. the ability to go to Israel and 
say we believe the Palestinians are working in good faith to 
halt terror.  This has not been the case over the past few 
years, Burns noted.  Lajolo then asked about Arafat\'s 
assertions that he was against terror.  Burns pointed out 
that Arafat has \"knowingly turned a blind eye.\"  Abu Alla 
appears to understand the obligation to stop terror, Burn 
observed, and not only as a favor to the U.S. but as 
something in the Palestinians\' own interest.  He also noted 
that Egypt has been actively engaging to help achieve a 
cease-fire, engagement President Bush has encouraged.

Iraq: Progress Amidst Uncertainty 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Turning to Iraq, Lojolo asked for Burns\' assessment of 
the situation on the ground.  Burns responded that although 
the security situation remained difficult, the economic and 
social situation was improving.  Electricity, health care, 
water, and education were all at pre-war levels or better. 
The challenge now for the coalition was to move beyond repair 
of existing infrastructure and repair the neglect and damage 
of the past 30 years.  So much of the economic and political 
system was broken under Saddam, Burns noted, that it will 
take time to fix. 
 
6. (C) The U.S. hoped to see a sovereign transition 
government by the summer of 2004, Burns said, which would be 
one step in a multiyear process.  To assure progress in this 
difficult transition, he added, Iraq would need the support 
of the UN and international community.  Lajolo said that from 
the Holy See\'s perspective, they did not want to see the U.S. 
out of Iraq until a stable government had been established 
with generally democratic principles.  \"All the world is 
watching what the U.S. is doing,\" Lajolo observed, aadding 
that the Holy See was hoping and praying for U.S. success. 
In this regard, he stressed the importance of convincing the 
Iraqi people that the U.S. was in Iraq for the good of the 
people of Iraq.  Burns agreed, noting that the U.S. intended 
to move as quickly as possible to restore authority to 
Iraqis, so that people would see that the U.S. did not intend 
to stay, but would also see the enduring U.S. commitment to a 
democratic and effective government. 
 
----- 
Syria 
----- 
 
7. (C) Recognizing U.S. concerns about Syria, Lajolo asked 
Burns for his assesment of developments there and of Syria\'s 
relations with the U.S.  Burns told Lajolo that relations 
remained difficult.  Noting a series of recent high-level 
meetings with Assad, Burns said the U.S. had been candid in 
explaining our concerns, but that we have also made clear our 
interest in better relations with Syria if it takes the steps 
needed to make that possible, including greater cooperation 
against terrorists.  Burns observed that Syria had stepped up 
cooperation over the past three months to control its border 
with Iraq, but that there was still much to do on terror. 
Burns also noted Assad\'s recent opening to Israel in a New 
York Times interview.  While the time may not be ripe to 
resolve the Israeli-Syrian issues now, he added, the U.S. 
would nevertheless encourage both sides to pursue this 
opening.  But the Syrians also need to match their more 
encouraging rhetoric on this issue with real changes in 
behavior, particularly stopping the actions of terrorist 
groups headquartered in Damascus.  Words alone are not enough. 
 
---- 
Iran 
---- 
 
8. (C) Turning to Iran, Burns emphasized that the nuclear 
program was our first concern.  While the U.S. welcomed the 
recent Iranian commitments to the IAEA and would work with 
others to try to lock them in, we remained very skeptical of 
Iran\'s seriousness.  Burns observed that there may be some 
areas of common interest with Iran, including Afghanistan and 
perhaps even Iraq.  For example, even though Iran had sent 
some intelligence service members into southern Iraq, the 
U.S. did not believe Iran wanted to see Iraq destabilized. 
It was therefore possible to find accommodations, as in 
Afghanistan. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Lajolo has indicated that the Middle East would be his 
top priority as the Vatican\'s new Foreign Minister 
equivalent, and A/S Burns visit afforded an excellent 
opportunity to convey U.S. priorities and concerns in the 
region at the outset of his tenure.  Lajolo, who was 
preparing to meet the Israeli FM the following day, was 
clearly focused, attentive, and open to U.S. views.  His 
acknowledgment that the Holy See wants the U.S. to stay in 
Iraq reflects both the Vatican\'s concern for Chaldean 
Catholics in Iraq and its recognition that what happens there 
will have lasting implications for the region and its 
relations with the Western world.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) During the presentation of the Pope\'s World Day of 
Peace message December 17 (ref a), Cardinal Renato Martino, 
President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, 
caused a stir with comments critical of U.S. treatment of 
Saddam Hussein following his capture.  Media gave wide 
attention to Martino\'s assertion that he felt \"compassion\" 
for Saddam and that the U.S. had treated him \"like a cow\" by 
filming and displaying his medical examination.  Many media 
mistakenly suggested that this first public reaction to the 
arrest of Saddam by a Vatican official reflected an official 
Vatican view.  The Ambassador registered U.S. concern with 
Martino\'s characterization with Vatican Foreign Minister 
Lajolo, and in writing to Secretary of State Sodano.  A 
number of senior officials, including former FM Tauran, have 
conveyed their displeasure with Martino\'s comments to the 
Ambassador.  Martino was outspoken in his opposition to the 
Iraq war, and had to be reigned in earlier this year. 
Embassy has urged the Holy See to clarify its official view 
to repair the public impression generated by Martino\'s 
ill-advised comments.  End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
Martino Sounds Off 
------------------ 
 
2.  (C) During the presentation of the Pope\'s World Day of 
Peace message December 17 (ref a), Cardinal Renato Martino, 
President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, 
whose responsibility it is to present the annual message to 
the media, caused a stir with several off the cuff comments 
critical of U.S. actions connected to the arrest of Saddam. 
Martino, the former Holy See Permanent Observer at the UN in 
New York, had been outspoken in his criticism of U.S. policy 
in the run-up to the Iraq war, often diverging from the more 
moderate and nuanced views of the Pope.  Though at that time 
a private rebuke from then Foreign Minister Tauran may have 
quieted Martino, yesterday\'s occasion presented the 
opportunity for him to grab some headlines again, offering 
the first substantial reaction by a Vatican official to the 
capture and detention of Saddam. 
 
-------------------- 
\"Treated like a Cow\" 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) While Martino allowed that the Holy See \"hopes this 
capture . . . may contribute to the pacification and 
democratization of Iraq,\" he also voiced displeasure at the 
broadcast of TV images showing a bedraggled Saddam undergoing 
a medical examination shortly after his detention.  \"What 
caused me pain was seeing this ruined man, treated like a cow 
whose teeth are being examined.  They could have spared us 
those pictures,\" he said.  \"I felt compassion for him.\" 
Martino described Saddam as \"a man of tragedy,\" with heavy 
responsibilities for the crimes he committed.  Martino added 
several negative comments on the war, saying that \"it would 
be illusory to think that (the capture of Saddam would) 
repair the damage caused by that great defeat for humanity 
which war always represents.\"  In remarks more reflective of 
the Holy See\'s general outlook on events, the Cardinal added 
that the Vatican wanted Saddam to receive a fair trial for 
alleged crimes during his long dictatorship.  He said that, 
as in other cases, the Vatican is opposed to the death 
penalty in this instance. 
----------------------------- 
Media Picks up Martino\'s Rant 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Martino\'s comments trumped the release of the World 
Peace Day message  -- certainly not good form to upstage a 
Papal message --  and received prominent play in the media. 
Most media, rather than highlighting the Pope\'s message 
calling for an international effort to update international 
legal mechanisms to deal with problems posed by terrorism, 
highlighted the Vatican \"rebuke\" to the U.S. and its 
\"compassion\" for Saddam.   The Vatican\'s official newspaper, 
while highlighting the attacks that folowed the arrest, also 
said that the dictator\'s detention widened the prospects for 
an era of peace, justice and normal life in Iraq.  The 
Italian Bishops\' Conference daily Avvenire\'s front-page 
headline, \"Safer with Saddam in Shackles,\" reflected the now 
 
oft-enunciated relistic position on Iraq (ref b) of the 
Pope\'s Viar for Rome, Cardinal Camillo Ruini.  (Note: As 
resident of the Italian Bishops Conference, Ruini is 
responsible for the editorial tone of Avvenire. End note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Ambassador Registers Complaint with Vatican MFA 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  (C) Folowing Martino\'s outburst, the Ambassador met with 
Holy See Foreign Minister equivalent Giovanni Lajolo December 
17 to register U.S. displeasure with Martino,s comments. 
The Ambassador said the characterization of poor treatment of 
Saddam was simply untrue, and the Cardinal\'s statements had 
served both to obscure the Pope\'s World Peace Day message and 
to confuse the U.S. government and public about who was 
speaking for the Vatican.  He noted that media had widely 
reported the remarks as Vatican comments, and showed Lajolo a 
copy of a New York Times article reprinted in the 
International Herald Tribune. 
 
6.  (C) Lajolo was deferential, but surprisingly unmoved by 
the Ambassador\'s concerns.   He described Martino,s comments 
as personal views, adding that it was the media,s job -- and 
that of the U.S. Embasy -- to be sure the public and USG 
were aware ofthe distinction between a personal statement 
andan official statement from the Holy See.  He was nt 
receptive to the Ambassador,s suggestion that te Vatican 
ought to release an official statementon Saddam,s capture, 
in order to be clear who was speaking for the Vatican, and 
resolve any confusion on the Holy See,s position.  Lajolo 
said the better idea was to \"let the matter drop\" and not 
continue the controversy.  He went on to say that he agreed 
that the images of Saddam should not have been broadcast as 
they had been.  According to Lajolo, the U.S. had not treated 
Saddam \"as a person and as a former head of state\" should be 
treated, his previous crimes notwithstanding.  (Note: The 
Vatican made similar protests when captured troops, and 
bodies of slain U.S. soldiers were displayed by Iraqis during 
the war. End note). 
 
-------------------- 
Fallout May Continue 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (C) In conversations with Vatican contacts December 17, 
the Ambassador learned that there was substantial 
dissatisfaction with Martino\'s remarks within the Curia. 
Many disagreed sharply with the content of the comments, and 
also questioned the appropriateness of Martino\'s airing them 
to the media -- and stealing the limelight from the Pope\'s 
World Peace Day message.  We also learned that Martino\'s 
Justice and Peace Council has been receiving numerous faxes 
and e-mails complaining about the Cardinal\'s statement. 
Former Foreign Minister Tauran (protect), who since the Iraq 
War has stepped into a less visible position but still has 
pull in the Vatican, told the Ambassador he was incensed with 
Martino\'s display, and surprised at Lajolo\'s reaction to the 
affair.  The Ambassador has communicated with Secretary of 
State Sodano on the matter (text of letter faxed to EUR/WE) 
and plans to see him in person next week. 
 
------------------------------ 
Comment: What\'s Going on Here? 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) Cardinal Martino, long a thorn in the U.S. side on 
war and peace issues (though a staunch ally in educating the 
public on genetically modified food), has likely been aching 
to get his two cents in on U.S. policy in Iraq since he was 
silenced in the run-up to the Iraq war.   Having been created 
a Cardinal in the meantime, and now presented with an 
opportunity to comment on the issue before the media, he 
could not resist.  A contact who works with Martino told us 
that he thought Martino was also smarting from having his 
draft of the Peace Day Message turnedback by the Secretariat 
of State as too inflammaory (ref a).  Faced with media 
questions as to wy the message had been changed, he may have 
been rying to save face, while getting some media play. 
 
9.  (C) Despite the perception of the Vatican breaucracy as 
high on authority and discipline --which is generally the 
case on religious issues - the reality is quite different 
when it comes topolitical matters.  With regard to the 
latter, mny Cardinals feel free to air their personal views 
and rarely face reprimand.  In this instance, the 
free-lancing has created a damaging public impression that 
some would like to see corrected.   While fellow Vatican 
officials are loathe to criticize one of their own, it is 
clear that many within the Curia find such ill-considered 
 
statements to the press to be a hindrance in promoting the 
Holy See\'s international goals.  We will continue to press 
this point with the Holy See in the hopes that Martino and 
others will seek a \"Nihil Obstat\" before opening their mouths 
on such sensitive issues in the future.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Pope John Paul II challenged Sudanese 
bishops on an officialvisit to Rome to expand 
their inter-religious dialogue efforts in the 
search for peace in Sudan.  Vatican officials 
focused their attention in particular on newly- 
created Cardinal Wako of Khartoum, pressing him 
to engage in dialogue.  The Pope also proposed 
the creation of a new inter-religious agency 
for the coordination of humanitarian aid that 
could serve to increase cooperation between 
faiths, in addition to alleviating some of 
the effects of the civil war.  Finally, the 
Holy See encouraged the bishops to \"rekindle 
efforts\" to establish a Catholic university in 
Sudan.  With the elevation of Wako and other 
moves, the Holy See is signaling its renewed 
emphasis on Sudan and its hope of attracting 
world attention to the plight of Sudan\'s 
beleaguered people.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Pope Challenges Sudanese Bishops 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Pope John Paul II challenged Sudanese 
bishops December 15, during their quinquennial 
\"ad limina\" visit to Rome, to expand their 
inter-religious dialogue efforts in the search 
for peace in Sudan.  The Pope applauded the 
reactivation of Sudan\'s Commission 
for Inter-religious Dialogue in his official 
statement, and Vatican officials reportedly 
reinforced this message in their talks with 
the bishops.  Holy See Sudan Country Director 
Lucio Sembrano told us December 11 that newly- 
created Cardinal Gabriel Zubeir Wako of 
Khartoum was a particular focus of Vatican 
efforts.  Sembrano said that Wako had 
traditionally shown little faith in such inter- 
religious ventures, but now had the opportunity 
to make a difference -- especially given 
his new status as the first 
Sudanese Cardinal (ref a). 
 
------------------------------------------ 
But Religious Tensions Will Not Die Easily 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) Sembrano was unsure of the effect of 
Vatican lobbying efforts with Wako.  The 
Cardinal has been quoted in the press here as 
affirming the possibility of peace, but has 
also emphasized the way in which \"religious 
differences have been used almost as a weapon of 
war\" in the conflict.  Our conversations with 
Sembrano lead us to believe that, like many 
in the Sudanese Church embittered by 
dehumanizing treatment of Christians by Islamic 
fundamentalists (ref b), Wako would be carrying 
a lot of baggage into inter-religious 
dialogue.  A September interview with 
Archbishop Paulino Lukudu Loro of Juba, 
Sudan (published by Rome-based Zenit Catholic 
news service, which is well read in Vatican 
circles) offered another example of this 
mindset.  Though Lukudu emphasized the need 
to \"look ahead,\" he made it clear that it 
 
 
was necessary to \"confront the injustices\" 
of the past.  He acknowledged the existence 
of some variety of views towards Christianity 
within the Sudanese Islamic world, but inveighed 
against the \"fanatical Islam\" that is \"always 
pushing further south.\"  Sembrano in no way 
diminished the suffering undergone by Sudanese 
Christians, but indicated that dialogue and 
cooperation were the Holy See\'s preferred way 
ahead at this point.   He said at this 
juncture, more strident criticism such as 
that of Bishop Macram Max Gassi, pastor-in-exile 
of El Obeid and an outspoken critic 
of the situation in Sudan, may not 
be productive. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
New Inter-Religious Aid Organization Would 
Present Opportunities 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU) Another piece of the Pope\'s message was 
a proposal for the creation of a new inter- 
religious agency for the coordination 
of humanitarian aid.  Sembrano told us the 
Holy See felt such an organization would provide 
an opportunity for trust and collaboration with 
Muslims and with the Anglican community in Sudan. 
He said the Holy See welcomed the participation 
of organizations from all faiths, many of which 
were in a good position to help, especially in 
Southern Sudan.  Sembrano did not diminish the 
work of existing aid organizations, but suggested 
that those who knew the territory would be better 
equipped to deal with the particular 
challenges Sudan poses to such work. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Catholic University in Khartoum? 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Elsewhere in the address, the Pope also 
encouraged the bishops to \"rekindle efforts\" to 
establish a Catholic University in Khartoum. 
Sembrano emphasized to us the high priority the 
Holy See places on education as a vehicle for the 
promotion of mutual understanding and tolerance; 
he added that the Khartoum government had been 
supportive of the idea of opening a university. 
(Note: In the past, Vatican contacts have also 
touted education as the best defense against 
Islamic fundamentalism in Sudan and 
elsewhere (ref b).  End note.) 
 
------------------------ 
Financial Accountability 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) One challenge in the creation of both 
the university and new aid organization is that of 
financial accountability and efficiency.  Sembrano 
(protect) indicated that the Sudanese bishops 
had, at times in the past, not been good stewards 
of their financial resources.  Any funding of such 
projects would have to be monitored 
carefully.  The Pope also made this point in his 
address to the bishops, calling for \"equity and 
transparency...[in] all financial matters...with 
every effort being made to see that contributions 
are truly used for the purposes intended.\" 
 
----------------- 
Political Climate 
----------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Speaking more generally, Sembrano was 
critical of the Khartoum government, and outlined 
the struggles of the Catholic Church in Sudan. 
 
 
Among other offenses, he noted that the Church 
had not been granted a building permit since the 
1960s.  Moreover, he said, the government destroys 
existing churches, claiming that they lie in the 
path of necessary new roads.  Still, overall, 
Sembrano believed the Sudanese government to be 
\"less hard\" in its policies than it had been in 
the past.  He was optimistic that a peace agreement 
could be worked out before the end of the year. 
A key to a lasting peace, he said, would be the 
support of churches and other organizations 
representative of the Sudanese people. 
The Catholic Church, he maintained, was a 
stabilizing force in Sudan.  According to Sembrano, 
the bishops are not pushing for independence 
for the south, and would respect the choice of 
the population on Sudan\'s political future as 
long as there is freedom of religion for all. 
 
---------------------------- 
Humanitarian Situation Grave 
---------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) The humanitarian situation, especially 
in the South, is grave, Sembrano said.  Catholic 
aid agency Caritas is active, but is restricted 
to certain areas of the country.  According 
to Sembrano, this means that some Sudanese in 
remote areas ravaged by the civil war are 
essentially condemned to starvation.  Sembrano 
noted that these injustices are often the result of 
the actions of local officials rather than of 
Khartoum.  Indoctrinated with a hardline Islamist 
mindset, they have knee-jerk reactions to those 
whom they suspect of undermining their authority. 
Also of great concern to the Holy See are the 
droves of internally displaced persons who may 
return home in the wake of a peace agreement to 
find nothing to sustain them. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Comment: Vatican Increases Emphasis, 
Sees Challenges Ahead 
------------------------------------ 
 
9.  (C) Sembrano said the Holy See\'s creation 
of Khartoum Archbishop Wako as Cardinal was 
intended to draw attention to the human rights 
crisis in Sudan.  \"The Holy Father wants 
to let the Sudanese people know that the Holy 
See has not abandoned them,\" he told us. 
According to Sembrano, the Pope also chose this 
fall to canonize Daniel Comboni, a former 
missionary in Sudan, in order to emphasize the 
Vatican\'s interest in the country. 
 
10.  (C) The next step is cooperation -- 
not just with Muslims, but within the Church. 
Sembrano (protect) confided to us that Cardinal 
Wako had not been overly cooperative 
with the Holy See, failing in the past even to 
call on the Apostolic Nuncio (the Vatican\'s 
Ambassador) to Sudan Dominique Mamberti. 
Mamberti himself has been preoccupied by the 
recent death of his mother, but now, 
according to Sembrano, is ready to reach out to 
Wako and cooperate to help promote the Holy See\'s 
agenda.  With his new status as Cardinal and 
increased support and prodding from the Vatican, 
Wako may be ready to contribute to 
inter-religious cooperation in Sudan.  Sembrano 
made a point of praising \"all the U.S. is doing\" 
to help bring a lasting peace to the country and 
would welcome USG efforts to further the 
initiatives outlined above.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Holy See Secretary of State (Prime Minister 
equivalent) Cardinal Angelo Sodano wrote in a December 20 
letter to the Ambassador that comments of Cardinal Renato 
Martino expressing \"compassion\" for Saddam Hussein and 
criticism of U.S. treatment of him after his capture (ref a) 
did not represent \"the mind of the Holy See.\"  Our 
conversations around the Vatican indicate that there was 
substantial fallout from the incident.  While this does not 
guarantee that such free-lancing will not be repeated, Curia 
personnel are now keenly aware that the upper reaches of 
Vatican bureaucracy were not pleased by Martino\'s 
ill-considered statements.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Ambassador Bumps Issue up to the Secretary of State 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2.  (C) After President of the Pontifical Council for Justice 
and Peace Cardinal Renato Martino caused a stir with comments 
expressing \"compassion\" for Saddam Hussein, and criticism of 
U.S. treatment of him after his capture, the Ambassador had 
first raised the issue with the new Holy See Foreign Minister 
Giovanni Lajolo (ref a).  Lajolo\'s unsatisfying response 
prompted the Ambassador to approach the Holy See\'s Secretary 
of State (Prime Minister equivalent) Cardinal Angelo Sodano 
to register U.S. displeasure.  In a letter to Sodano seeking 
clarification of Martino\'s comments, the Ambassador pointed 
out that the U.S. \"has treated and will continue to treat 
Saddam Hussein with the dignity due every human being, and 
will assure he receives the justice he denied to so many.\" 
He added that, \"suggestions from responsible Vatican 
officials of anything to the contrary are a source of 
considerable concern to my government and to the people of 
the United States.\"  The Ambassador pointed out that 
Martino\'s remarks had been widely interpreted in the 
international media as representing the official view of the 
Holy See. (Complete text of letter faxed 12/19 to EUR/WE.) 
 
----------------------------------- 
Sodano: Comments Not Representative 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Though Sodano was unable to meet the Ambassador in 
person for two days due to his busy Christmas schedule at the 
Vatican, he responded promptly to a letter the Ambassador 
delivered to him on December 18.  Sodano\'s letter clearly 
distanced the Secretariat of State -- the top level of the 
Vatican bureaucracy -- from Martino\'s comments.  Sodano wrote 
that the comments had been \"amplified by the press\" and could 
\"in reality\" only \"be understood as an extemporaneous and 
personal reaction to a question made by a journalist.\"  The 
reaction, Sodano stressed, \"was not inherent to the 
presentation of the Pontifical document\" presented that day. 
In the final analysis, Sodano concluded, \"there is no 
objective reason to consider these comments as representing 
the mind of the Holy See.\"  He asked the Ambassador to convey 
his response to the USG. 
 
--------------------------- 
Comment: Martino Chastened? 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Sodano\'s response to the Ambassador\'s letter 
represents a strong rebuke for Martino in a culture in which 
a reprimand of one cardinal by another is very rare.  More 
than one media contact also informed us that they had 
received an \"unprecedented\" call from unnamed \"very senior\" 
Vatican officials after receipt of the Ambassador\'s letter 
emphasizing that Cardinal Martino\'s comments were his 
personal views and did not reflect the views of the Pope, 
which were contained in his World Peace Day message.  One 
journalist pointed out that in his many years of covering the 
Vatican, he had never previously received such an unsolicited 
clarification from such senior levels of the Curia.  Other 
conversations with high-ranking Vatican Curia officials 
indicate widespread dissatisfaction with the content of 
Martino\'s comments -- which one insider told us he had 
actually reviewed with his staff before the press conference 
-- and perhaps even more so with his choice of venue for 
airing them.  While none of this will necessarily prevent 
 
Martino or another maverick from getting \"off message\" in the 
future, Curia personnel are now keenly aware that the upper 
reaches of Vatican bureaucracy and many others in the Holy 
See were not pleased by the Cardinal\'s indiscreet remarks.

REF: VATICAN 5431 
 
1.POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S MESSAGE FOR THE 2004 WORLD DAY OF 
MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES DIRECTLY LINKED MIGRATION ISSUES WITH 
EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A CULTURE OF PEACE.  TO CULTIVATE A 
CULTURE OF PEACE WITHIN A LANDSCAPE OF GREATER STABILITY, 
THE POPE CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PROMOTE 
CONDITIONS THAT SAFEGUARDED \"THE RIGHT TO NOT EMIGRATE.\" 
    TO THE HOLY SEE, THIS MEANS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO LIVE PEACEFULLY AND WITH DIGNITY IN THEIR OWN 
COUNTRY, AND NOT BE COMPELLED BY WAR, UNREST, OR ECONOMIC 
DEPRIVATION TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES.  TO DO SO, HOWEVER, THE 
HOLY SEE INSISTS THAT GOVERNMENTS MUST ENSURE FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION AND MOVEMENT, AS WELL AS FOOD, HEALTH, WORK, 
HOUSING AND EDUCATION -- ALL NECESSITIES WHICH, WHEN 
LACKING, LEAD PEOPLE TO EMIGRATE. 
 
2.THE PAPAL MESSAGE, WHICH FOLLOWED A MAJOR VATICAN 
CONFERENCE ON MIGRATION IN NOVEMBER (REFTEL) ALSO AFFIRMED 
A RIGHT TO MIGRATE.  THE POPE SAID THE WORLD AND ITS 
RESOURCES BELONGED TO ALL PEOPLE, AND THAT WHILE 
GOVERNMENTS HAD A RIGHT TO REGULATE MIGRATION, PEOPLE ALSO 
HAD A RIGHT TO SEEK SAFETY AND A DIGNIFIED LIFE ABROAD. 
THE POPE CONDEMNED THE CREATION OF MIGRANT GHETTOS IN 
RECEIVING COUNTRIES AND SUGGESTED A GRADUAL INTEGRATION OF 
MIGRANTS THAT RESPECTED BOTH THEIR IDENTITY AND THE 
CULTURAL PATRIMONY OF THE HOST COUNTRY.  THE MESSAGE 
IMPLIED THAT MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS IN THE HOME COUNTRY 
AND TOLERANT SOCIAL INTEGRATION IN THE RECEIVING COUNTRY 
COULD COUNTERACT THE INCREASING PHENOMENON OF WAR AND OTHER 
FORMS OF VIOLENCE THAT OFTEN DRAW ENERGY FROM DISAFFECTED 
AND MARGINALIZED PEOPLE. 
 
3.COMMENT:  THE POPE\'S MESSAGE CONDEMNED WAR, VIOLENCE, 
, 
TERRORISM, OPPRESSION, DISCRIMINATION AND INJUSTICE IN A 
WAY CONSISTENT WITH TRADITIONAL HOLY SEE POLICY POSITIONS. 
THE VATICAN SEES THE LINKS AMONG THESE ILLS THAT COMBINE TO 
THREATEN HUMAN DIGNITY.  THE POPE DESCRIBED TRUE PEACE AS 
    NOT MERELY THE ABSENCE OF CONFLICT, BUT A LONG-TERM DYNAMIC 
PROCESS INVOLVING ALL PEOPLE AND ENGENDERING RESPECT FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE POPE\'S MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES MESSAGE WAS 
IN LINE WITH ELEMENTS OF THE U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY 
STRATEGY CALLING FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, ESTABLISHMENT OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL STABILITY, THE MAINTENANCE OF 
PEACE, AND INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY.  THE MESSAGE ALSO 
CONTAINED A STRONG CONDEMNATION OF TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN 
BEINGS AS THE WORK OF \"UNSCRUPULOUS EXPLOITERS.\"    END 
COMMENT.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.In his annual address to the Vatican Diplomatic Corps, 
the Pope emphasized the importance of the international 
community\'s working together to help the Iraqis to become 
self-governing with a democratically established political 
and economic system.  Observing that Iraqis had been \"freed 
from the regime that had oppressed them,\" he expressed hope 
that Iraq would become a credible partner in the 
international community.  The Pope blasted terrorism and 
said that any civilization worthy of the name should 
categorically reject the use of such violence.  He pointed 
to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict as a root of 
destabilization for the entire region and urged \"respect 
for the legitimate aspirations of both sides.\"  The Pope 
also emphasized the importance of building a more effective 
collective security centered on the United Nations, and 
able to deal with the new challenges of terrorism it has 
failed thus far to master.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Moving Forward in Iraq 
---------------------- 
 
2.  In his annual address to the Vatican Diplomatic Corps, 
January 12 (full text sent to EUR/WE), the Pope 
acknowledged the \"numerous steps\" the Holy See had taken in 
the hopes of avoiding war in Iraq, but focused on the 
importance of the international community\'s working 
together to aid the Iraqi people.  The Pope said the 
international community should now help the Iraqis, \"freed 
from the regime that had oppressed them,\" to become self- 
governing with a democratically established political and 
economic system.  He also called for Iraq to regain a 
credible place in the international community. 
 
-------------------------------- 
No to Terrorism - and no to War 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  The Pope strongly condemned international terrorism, 
asserting that it dishonored the causes it claimed to serve 
by sowing the seeds of hatred, fear and fanaticism.  He 
stressed that any civilization worthy of the name should 
categorically reject the use of violence.  Significantly, 
he told the gathered diplomats that the international 
community should never resign itself to \"passively 
accepting the violence that holds peace hostage.\"  To 
counter terrorism, the Pope said that \"now more than ever\" 
it was important to return to a more effective collective 
security centered on the United Nations so that it could 
fulfill the role envisioned for it.  In any event, the Pope 
stressed \"the one certainty\" that \"war could not resolve 
conflicts between peoples.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
Return to Negotiation in Middle East 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.The Pontiff described the unresolved Israeli- 
Palestinian issue as a permanent destabilizing factor for 
the entire region, as well as a source of suffering for 
both peoples.  He repeated his admonition to Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders that nothing is resolved by the 
recourse of arms, terrorism and reprisals, or by the 
humiliation of the enemy and hateful propaganda.  He urged 
mutual respect for each entity\'s legitimate aspirations, as 
well as a return to the negotiating table.  He said that 
concrete efforts on the part of the international community 
were essential to achieve a resolution to the conflict. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Conflicts the World Over Dramatic 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  Elsewhere in the world, the Pope noted the damaging 
effects of other conflicts; in particular in Africa.  He 
observed that their impact on local populations was often 
\"dramatic,\" adding that they contributed to poverty and the 
deterioration of the institutional fabric, plunging people 
into desperation.  The Pope also highlighted the danger of 
arms manufacturing and trafficking. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Religion: An important Role to Play 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
6.  Not surprisingly, John Paul II stressed the importance 
of religious faith as a means to peace.  He said that 
faith-based respect for inalienable human rights and 
dignity helped create a peaceful and peace-making world. 
In this regard, he urged secular states to do more than 
merely guarantee freedom of worship.  Rather, he said, 
secular society should engage in a respectful dialogue with 
religions to enhance each nation\'s future.  Church and 
State are not rivals, said the Pope, but rather partners in 
promoting the development of the human person as well as 
social harmony.  The Pope said the difficulty some European 
countries had in accepting religion operating \"in the 
public sphere\" revealed itself in the recent debate on 
Europe\'s Christian roots in the EU constitution.  He 
insisted that world leaders should see Christians as a 
resource -- particularly for the process of \"education for 
peace,\" a major theme of his 2004 World Day of Peace 
Message (reftel). 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Comment: Message Tracks with U.S. Policy 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  Though some U.S. critics might seize on the Pope\'s 
rejection of war as a means to resolve conflicts and his 
reference to the Vatican\'s efforts to avoid war, the core 
of Pope\'s message provided strong backing for priority 
U.S. goals in Iraq and the Middle East.  The Holy See\'s 
preference to avoid war is well known; but its insistence 
that the international community should now move forward to 
help the Iraqis achieve a democratic self-government now 
that they have been \"freed from the regime that had 
oppressed them\" was a very positive message for the U.S. 
Similarly, the Pope\'s emphasis on a central role for the UN 
-- though implying criticism of the UN\'s being sidelined in 
Iraq -- reflects the Pope\'s new interest in revamping 
international law to deal with the challenges of global 
terrorism.  All of this suggests that the U.S. has an 
important ally in the Pope for our goals in Iraq, the 
Middle East, and against terrorism. 
 
8.  Minimize considered.

1.(U) A SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIAL, CARDINAL JEAN-LOUIS 
TAURAN, LAMENTED IN AN END OF YEAR INTERVIEW WITH THE 
FRENCH CATHOLIC DAILY LA CROIX THAT NON-MUSLIMS WERE 
TREATED LIKE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS IN MANY STATES WITH A 
MUSLIM MAJORITY.  TAURAN, THE HOLY SEE\'S FOREIGN MINISTER 
FOR 13 YEARS BEFORE HIS 2003 PROMOTION TO CARDINAL, FOCUSED 
    HIS FIRE ON SAUDI ARABIA\'S VIOLATIONS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
ARISING FROM ITS BAN ON PLACES OF CHRISTIAN WORSHIP AND ON 
SERVICES IN PRIVATE HOMES.  TAURAN CALLED FOR RECIPROCITY 
OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, RECALLING THAT MUSLIMS ARE ABLE TO 
BUILD MOSQUES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  CARDINAL TAURAN 
DESCRIBED THE DIALOGUE WITH ISLAM AS A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR 
WESTERN SOCIETY AND CHURCHES.

TOUGH CRITIQUE OF ISLAM IN THE INFLUENTIAL JESUIT BI- 
MONTHLY LA CIVILTA CATTOLICA, WHOSE ARTICLES ARE VETTED BY 
THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE AND CONSIDERED IN LINE WITH 
VATICAN POLICY.  THE OCTOBER 18 ISSUE DETAILED THE 
SITUATION OF CHRISTIANS IN MUSLIM STATES AND DESCRIBED 
ISLAM AS HAVING A \"WARLIKE FACE\" THROUGHOUT HISTORY.  IT 
CHARGED THAT MUSLIM COUNTRIES SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA, SUDAN 
AND PAKISTAN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST CHRISTIANS.  THE ARTICLE 
WARNED AGAINST THE RISE OF FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAM AND PLACED 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE DOMAIN OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS.  IT 
ALSO EXPRESSED CONSTERNATION AT THE INCREASING DESIRE IN 
SOME COUNTRIES FOR THE APPLICATION OF SHARIA LAW TO NON- 
MUSLIMS. 
 
3.(SBU) COMMENT: THE HOLY SEE IS COMMITTED TO RESPECTFUL 
DIALOGUE WITH ISLAM -- WITH POPE JOHN PAUL II AT THE 
FOREFRONT OF ITS INITIATIVES.  AS A REFLECTION OF THIS 
COMMITMENT, THE VATICAN WILL HOST A CONCERT ON JANUARY 17 
7 
FEATURING THE THREE FAITHS OF ABRAHAM. (THIS 
\"RECONCILIATION\" CONCERT WAS CONCEIVED BY THE EMBASSY AND 
THE PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY WILL PLAY MAHLER\'S 2ND SYMPHONY, 
    \"THE RESURRECTION SYMPHONY\", WITH A MUSLIM CHOIR AND JEWISH 
CONDUCTOR).  HOWEVER, THE VATICAN\'S OUTREACH TO THE MUSLIM 
WORLD IS NOT AN UNCRITICAL EMBRACE OF ISLAM.  AS IT 
CONTINUES TO SEE LIMITED PROGRESS IN SOME OF ITS EFFORTS TO 
BUILD A DIALOGUE, THE HOLY SEE IS REVEALING A MOUNTING 
FRUSTRATION AT ELEMENTS OF ISLAM THAT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST 
CHRISTIANS IN MUSLIM-MAJORITY STATES, FOMENT HATRED OF 
JEWS, OR THAT REJECT INTEGRATION OF MUSLIM MIGRANTS INTO 
WESTERN SOCIETY.  EVEN THE HOLY SEE\'S 2003 GREETING TO 
MUSLIMS TO CELEBRATE THE END OF RAMADAN -- USUALLY A 
PERFUNCTORY SALUTATION -- URGED MUTUAL RESPECT FOR HUMAN 
DIGNITY AND RIGHTS, AS WELL AS EMPATHY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. 
WE EXPECT TO SEE A CONTINUATION OF THIS KIND OF SUBTLE 
PRESSURE ON ISLAMIC STATES AND ORGANIZATIONS TO DEMONSTRATE 
GREATER RECIPROCITY AND OPENNESS TOWARDS OTHER RELIGIONS.

SUBJECT: The Pope\'s Europe:  Whole, Free and Faithful 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) From the start of his Pontificate, Pope John Paul II 
has had a clear vision of Europe as a continent united, 
free, and faithful.  As an inspirational symbol for the 
Polish nation and a formidable voice for freedom, the Pope 
played an essential role in overcoming Europe\'s political 
divisions and restoring freedom to the East.  Today, as 
NATO and the EU move ahead to deepen European unity and 
entrench democracy, the Pope has increasingly turned his 
attention to Europe\'s faith -- or, more accurately, its 
lack thereof.  In his view, Europe must play a leading role 
as a force for peace in the world, but will not be able to 
o 
fulfill this role unless it returns to its spiritual roots. 
His desire to complete his vision of a Europe whole, free, 
and faithful is so strong that he has devoted an 
increasingly large share of his limited energy to achieve 
recognition of Europe\'s Christian roots in the EU 
Constitution and to build bridges with Europe\'s Orthodox 
East.  His efforts to reinforce European unity and 
strengthen its respect for core values of freedom and human 
rights continue to make this pope an important ally for the 
U.S. in our efforts to work with Europe to promote human 
dignity worldwide.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Freedom and Faith from the Atlantic to the Urals 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (SBU) Ever since the pope from the East took up the 
papacy, John Paul II has been driven by a fervent belief in 
a united Europe founded on Christian values stretching from 
the Atlantic to the Urals.  In the Pope\'s words, he wanted 
a Europe breathing with two lungs -- Western and Eastern, 
Roman and Orthodox, as distinct expressions of the same 
culture.  This vision has animated the Vatican\'s diplomatic 
efforts in Europe.  In the early years of his pontificate, 
John Paul II\'s European engagement focused on overcoming 
the division created by communism, while his post-Communist 
focus has been on building a united Europe rooted in 
Christian values that can be a force for good worldwide in 
promoting the primacy of human dignity and rights. 
 
3. (U) John Paul II saw in his election to the papacy a 
divine mandate to take up the defense of the oppressed in 
his native Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.  From 
the outset, his efforts against communism were less the 
work of a statesman or a diplomat, though he unhesitatingly 
delivered his message of freedom to Poland\'s Communist 
leaders.  Instead, his efforts were those of an 
inspirational pastor who provided his fellow Poles and 
others trapped behind the Iron Curtain tools of resistance 
that the morally bankrupt Communists could not match.  A 
Polish pope with a remarkable flair for public relations, 
insisting day after day after day on the fundamental 
inhumanity of Communism and embodying in his very person 
the failure of Marxism-Leninism to defeat or tame 
Catholicism in East Central Europe, proved to be a powerful 
symbol of freedom. 
 
4. (U) But where the Pope succeeded in providing a rallying 
point and unifying symbol for the oppressed in the East to 
reassert their dignity, he has been less successful in his 
post-Communist era efforts to revitalize the faith in 
secularized Western Europe.  It is also unclear whether his 
efforts in the more religious East will halt the region\'s 
own slow slide towards secularism.  As the Pope observed in 
his recent Apostolic exhortation, \"Ecclesia in Europe,\" 
Europeans increasingly exhibit a \"practical agnosticism and 
religious indifference,\" which have created an impression 
of living without spiritual roots.  In fact, the Pope sees 
Europe to be \"tragically suffering for a profound crisis of 
values that has led to a crisis of identity.\" 
 
-------------------------------- 
Moral Vision for a United Europe 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Rather than accepting this secular turn as 
inevitable, the Pope has instead been emboldened to press 
even harder for his fellow Europeans to use their newfound 
unity for good both within Europe and in the wider world. 
In his view, Christianity was the historical source of 
European unity -- the only force that united the diverse 
cultures, peoples, and languages into a coherent culture. 
He believes it remains central as the inspiration and 
foundation for essential European values: the dignity of 
the human person, respect for life and for the family, 
 
freedom of conscience and religion, the promotion of 
authentic social solidarity and the primacy of the rule of 
law.  The fact that modern Europe has given the world the 
concepts of democracy and human rights stems, the Pope 
insists, from its Christian heritage.  He has therefore 
been urging modern Europe to reclaim fundamental Christian- 
inspired values, which can be summarized in the affirmation 
of the transcendent dignity of the human person, the value 
of reason, freedom, democracy, the constitutional state and 
the distinction between political life and religious life. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Christian Roots and the EU Constitution 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) One focus of the Holy See\'s effort to reaffirm its 
Christian values has been its full-court press over the 
past year to secure some form of reference to Europe\'s 
Christian heritage in the new EU constitution.  The Pope\'s 
determination on this issue was reflected in his almost 
weekly calls this past summer in public addresses for 
Europe not to neglect its Christian past.  The Vatican\'s 
daily newspaper highlighted the Pope\'s sentiments with 
banner headlines asserting that \"Europe is either Christian 
or it\'s not Europe.\"  The Vatican believed that its close 
relationship with Italy and Italy\'s stewardship of the 
constitutional debate during its recent presidency offered 
perhaps the best chance for inserting the reference to 
Europe\'s Christian heritage in the Constitution.  Despite 
Italy\'s best efforts, and the strong support of Poland and 
Spain, the Vatican was unable to overcome the secularist 
opposition from France in particular in the latest 
constitutional draft. 
 
7.  The Holy See\'s persistence in seeking this reference to 
Christian roots against strong opposition within some EU 
countries appeared to many -- even some within the Curia -- 
to exceed its potential relevance for Christianity\'s future 
in Europe.  More important than a preambular reference to 
Christian roots, many argued, was language guaranteeing 
freedom of religion and ensuring that religious rights and 
privileges are enshrined in the new constitution. 
Specifically, the Holy See wants to ensure the right of 
Churches and religious communities to organize themselves 
freely, respect for the specific identity of religious 
confessions, provision for a structured dialogue between 
the EU and these confessions, and respect for the juridical 
status already enjoyed by Churches and religious 
institutions in various EU member states.  All of these 
appear to be well on track. 
 
8.  (U) In pushing for a \"Christian heritage\" reference and 
other provisions relating to religion, the Holy See\'s 
principal goal appears to be to build a foundation from 
which to counter increasingly dominant secularist 
tendencies within Europe and to reinvigorate the role of 
religion in European culture.  In this effort, it has 
considerable support from other religious groups.  In fact, 
although the Holy See has recently been at the forefront of 
calls for the recognition of Christianity in a European 
Constitution, the idea initially emerged from a meeting of 
the Council of European Churches (CEC) -- a Protestant 
group.  Only later did the Holy See and the Greek Orthodox 
join their voices to it as a means of enhancing the 
importance of religion in European society. 
 
------------------------------ 
Overcoming Religious Divisions 
------------------------------ 
 
9. (U) The Holy See\'s push for an acknowledgment of 
Christianity\'s role in the development of European culture 
should in no way be seen as inimical to healthy coexistence 
with other faiths within a multi-cultural, multi-religious 
Europe.  This would run counter to the Vatican\'s extensive 
work in interreligious dialogue under John Paul II, and its 
interest in religious liberty all over the globe.  Although 
dear to the Vatican\'s vision for Europe, the constitutional 
push is but one element of a Vatican approach to Europe 
that also seeks to repair the Catholic-Orthodox breach and 
improve relations with other religious groups in Europe -- 
including Jews, Muslims, Anglicans, and other protestant 
groups. 
 
10. (U) The Pope\'s openings towards the Orthodox Church in 
Romania, Greece, Hungary and Bulgaria have produced a 
climate of dialogue and respect that has replaced a history 
of spiteful accusations and mutual fear based on ignorance. 
To achieve this progress, the Pope has at times literally 
begged the Orthodox for forgiveness for historical sins and 
traveled thousands of miles to prove firsthand to the 
 
Orthodox leadership that Rome seeks partnership, and not 
proselytism.  The Pope\'s visit to the Patriarch of 
Constantinople in 1979, just 13 months after assuming the 
papacy, set the tone for his outreach to the Orthodox and 
established a strong Eastern orientation to the Holy See\'s 
ecumenism.  The Pope has been less successful repairing the 
breach with the Russian Orthodox Church, though more out of 
the ROC\'s deeply rooted insecurities than a lack of 
interest or effort on the part of the Holy See. 
 
11. (U) The Holy See\'s close dialogue with the Anglican 
Communion was recently complicated by the ordination of an 
active homosexual bishop in the United States, but both 
parties are seeking a way around this new \"obstacle to 
unity.\"  While formal dialogue talks scheduled for February 
were put on hold, the Vatican and the Anglican Communion 
did agree to establish a sub-commission to reflect on the 
ecclesiological issues raised by the ordination of the gay 
bishop.  Similar problems had arisen when the Anglican 
Church began ordaining female priests and bishops, but the 
desire for unity will continue to drive the Holy See to 
seek solutions to these obstacles.  Talks with the Lutheran 
World Federation are also ongoing and have resulted in 
several joint statements on theological issues.  While the 
complete resolution of doctrinal differences with both 
churches is a long way off, the Holy See works with both 
Anglican and Lutheran churches to enhance the 
religious voice in Europe on issues such as the inclusion 
of a reference to Europe\'s Christian heritage in the new 
European Constitution.  Though these relationships do not 
have the potential geopolitical impact that Catholic 
relations with the Orthodox, Jewish, or Muslim worlds have, 
in both these cases, patching theological rifts could also 
lead to cooperation between churches that could impact 
questions of war and peace, international aid funding, and 
other issues relating to development, poverty, and the 
family. 
 
12. (U) In its broadest strokes, the Pope\'s vision of a 
religiously united Eastern and Western Europe -- a Europe 
\"breathing with two lungs\" that would in time overcome a 
thousand years of separation -- reinforces other ongoing 
efforts to overcome Europe\'s division, such as NATO and EU 
enlargement.  While religious unity is still a distant 
dream, both between West and East and among Western groups, 
the growing cooperation between the Holy See and Eastern 
Orthodoxy, combined with growing political and economic 
unity between East and West, can open the door to the rise 
of a unity not seen since the days of the Byzantine Empire. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Dialogue with Jewish and Muslim Communities 
------------------------------------------- 
 
13. (U) Beyond his push for Christian unity in Europe, the 
Pope is also determined to expand the Holy See\'s dialogue 
to Europe\'s other major religious communities -- Judaism 
and Islam.  During his Pontificate, John Paul II has made 
great strides to improve relations with European Judaism, 
clearing the debris of centuries of misunderstanding and 
mistrust.  His historic 1986 visit to Rome\'s synagogue -- 
the first visit of a Pope to a temple since the earliest 
days of the Church -- has helped generate an ever-deeper 
dialogue with European Jewish communities.  The Pope\'s 
recent \'apostolic exhortation\' on Europe emphasizes the 
common roots linking Christians and Jews, acknowledges and 
expresses regret for the Church\'s past contribution to 
anti-Semitism in Europe, and encourages dialogue and 
cooperation with Jewish faithful.  The Holy See has 
condemned signs of renewed anti-Semitism within Europe, and 
can be counted on to work with the U.S. to counter such 
developments in the OSCE and in other fora. 
 
14. (U) The growing influence of European Islam has led the 
Vatican to seek to expand its dialogue with Muslims in 
Europe to promote respect for traditional values and to 
build respect for the place of religion in contemporary 
Europe.  The Holy See seeks a mutually enriching dialogue 
between various religious communities, which it believes 
can contribute to social and political harmony within 
Europe, especially with the arrival of increasing numbers 
of migrants from beyond the expanded European borders.  At 
the same time, the Vatican remains concerned about what it 
terms a \"notable gap between European culture, with its 
profound Christian roots, and Muslim thought.\"  In this 
regard, the Holy See continues to lament the fact that 
religious freedom in Europe is not reciprocated in many 
Muslim states. 
 
------------------------------- 
The Vatican\'s Agenda for Europe 
 
------------------------------- 
 
15. (U) The Holy See is a strong advocate for European 
unity, believing that Christianity provided the initial 
unifying force that brought together Europe\'s diverse 
cultural traditions, and that it continues today to provide 
a unifying foundation of ethical and moral values for the 
continent.  With the EU poised to bring in ten new members, 
the Vatican had hoped that the nations of \'new Europe\' -- 
with their recent experience of religious repression -- 
would counterbalance the secularism and loss of faith in 
the West with a renewed focus on moral and cultural values. 
This drive accounts for the Pope\'s recent focus in his 
travels to countries of Central and Eastern Europe -- most 
recently to Slovakia and Croatia -- where he has cautioned 
the Catholic faithful to avoid the loss of faith and moral 
direction that has afflicted the countries of the West. 
After surviving 40 years under the boot-heel of communism 
in many of these countries, the Catholic Church regards 
itself as a significant moral authority and has 
demonstrated a willingness to place itself squarely in the 
debate on key public issues in countries like Slovakia, 
Poland and Croatia. 
 
16. (U) The Holy See\'s central policy priority for Europe 
is a focus on \"fundamental values\" of the dignity of the 
human person, freedom, democracy, and constitutional order. 
In this regard, the Vatican will urge EU countries, old and 
new, to protect the rights of individuals and minorities; 
promote religious freedom; protect human life from 
conception to natural death; encourage family life based on 
the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman; welcome 
migrants; and guarantee young people a future with work, 
culture and education in moral and spiritual values.  The 
Holy See believes that new European institutions need to be 
more open to the religious dimension \"rooted in authentic 
ethical and civil values.\"  As the Pope told the Italian 
parliament in 2002, he wants to ensure that \"the new 
foundations of the European \'common house\' will not lack 
the \'cement\' of that extraordinary religious, cultural and 
civil patrimony which has given Europe its greatness down 
the centuries.\"  This is not to say that the Holy See is 
looking for an exclusively Christian Europe, but rather 
that it believes that without the cement of Christian 
influence, Europe will crumble into moral decay and 
\"existential anguish\" marked by a decline of the family, 
renewed ethnic conflicts, rising racism, inter-religious 
tension, and a selfish concern for personal interests over 
global solidarity. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Comment: Vatican\'s Vision and U.S. Interests 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
17. (U) John Paul II\'s vision of a united and outward- 
looking Europe rooted in Christian values faces 
considerable opposition from the powerful forces of 
secularism in Europe\'s West and from post-communist 
materialism and uncertainties in the East.  In fact, the 
Pope\'s failure to ignite in the historic heartland of 
Catholicism a spiritual fervor for the twenty-first century 
has been perhaps the greatest frustration of his papacy. 
One commentator has described Catholicism in Western Europe 
as being \"on life support,\" and in many countries, 
increasingly irrelevant.  This perception is why, in the 
twilight of his pontificate, the Pope has sought with such 
insistence to shore up the breaches of traditional 
Christianity.  For Pope John Paul II, the powerhouse for 
the construction of the new Europe of the third millennium 
should not be the legislatures of Brussels or Strasbourg, 
but the moral force of Christian values at the heart of 
European history and culture. 
 
18. (SBU) Ironically, although the Pope remains sharply 
focused on Europe\'s spirituality, his greatest influence in 
today\'s Europe lies in the political realm.  Europeans - 
at least in the West -- may only infrequently heed the 
Pope\'s religious teachings, but in both the East and West 
they do listen to his political voice.  His statements on 
terrorism, the Middle East, war and peace, international 
development, and inter-religious reconciliation are widely 
covered in the European press.  As a result, the Vatican\'s 
vision for and actions in Europe can offer useful support 
for U.S. goals of promoting a unified, democratic Europe 
acting as an ethically motivated partner with the U.S. to 
promote democracy, freedom, and justice worldwide. 
Likewise, his voice in support of social and economic 
stability, the rule of law, and democracy throughout 
Central and Eastern Europe reinforces U.S. efforts to 
ensure the successful integration of the East into Western 
institutions.  Finally, his caution to Europe to remain 
 
open to the global community can help overcome European 
self-absorption and foster a stronger and more morally- 
rooted European engagement with the world closer in line 
with U.S. priorities.

------------------------------------- 
CARDINAL SEES RESTRICTIONS IN VIETNAM 
------------------------------------- 
 
1.  (C) AMERICAN CARDINAL BERNARD LAW REVIEWED WITH POLOFF 
    JANUARY 28 HIS MID-DECEMBER TRIP TO VIETNAM AT THE INVITATION 
OF VIETNAM\'S NEW CARDINAL, JEAN-BAPTISTE PHAM MINH MAN.  LAW 
SAID HE SAW NO SIGNS THAT THE GVN WAS EVEN INCHING TOWARDS 
ALLOWING THE CATHOLIC CHURCH A ROLE IN CIVIL SOCIETY THROUGH 
TRADITIONAL MEANS SUCH AS SOCIAL SERVICES AND EDUCATION.  HE 
LAMENTED THE BACKLOG OF STUDENTS APPROVED FOR CATHOLIC 
SEMINARIES WHO WERE NOT ALLOWED TO PURSUE A VOCATION BECAUSE 
OF GOVERNMENT OBSTRUCTION.  LAW WENT ON TO RECOUNT AN 
INCIDENT SURROUNDING PLANS HE HAD MADE TO SAY MASS AT A RURAL 
MONASTERY.  THOUGH THE ARRANGEMENTS WERE INFORMAL AND 
UNPUBLICIZED, LAW DISCOVERED UPON ARRIVAL AT THE MONASTERY 
THAT HIS HOSTS SAID THEY HAD BEEN CALLED BY THE POLICE A HALF 
HOUR BEFORE AND FORBIDDEN TO ALLOW \"THE FOREIGNER\" TO PRESIDE 
AT MASS. 
 
---------------------- 
AND SOME HOPEFUL SIGNS 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (C) DESPITE THE STALEMATE ON THE CIVIL SOCIETY FRONT, LAW 
DID SEE PROGRESS IN OTHER AREAS.  CARDINAL MAN TOLD HIM THAT 
HE HAD RECEIVED PROMPT PERMISSION FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO 
TRANSFER OVER 30 PRIESTS RECENTLY, INCLUDING THREE TO STUDY 
ABROAD.  ALTHOUGH LAW SAID IT WAS REGRETTABLE SUCH PERMISSION 
WAS NEEDED, HE BELIEVED THE FACT THAT IT WAS GRANTED -- AND 
QUICKLY -- WAS NOTABLE.  LAW ALSO REPORTED THAT SOME BISHOPS 
HE KNOWS IN VIETNAM ARE MEETING REGULARLY WITH LAY CATHOLIC 
GROUPS ORGANIZED AROUND DIFFERENT THEMES.  FURTHER, PERHAPS 
SOME DEGREE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS INDICATED BY A REPORT TO 
CARDINAL LAW FROM THE BISHOP OF HUNG HOA, WHO SAID THAT HE 
HAD SEEN A FLURRY OF NEW CONVERSIONS TO CATHOLICISM IN HIS 
    DIOCESE, DESPITE A LACK OF CLERGY.  SOME ARE APPARENTLY 
TUNING IN TO EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN RADIO TRANSMITTED FROM 
OUTSIDE VIETNAM, AND THEN SEEKING THE NEAREST CHRISTIAN 
CHURCH, IN MOST CASES, CATHOLIC ONES. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
REPORT URGES ATTENTION TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUES 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3.  (C) CARDINAL LAW WROTE A REPORT FOR THE HOLY SEE BASED ON 
HIS TRIP, THAT WILL LIKELY BE DISSEMINATED TO THE SECRETARIAT 
OF STATE AND OTHER OFFICES CONCERNED WITH RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. 
IN IT HE CAUTIONED AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
DEVELOPING A POLICY TOWARDS VIETNAM SIMILAR TO ASPECTS OF ITS 
APPROACH TO CHINA, IN WHICH (LAW WROTE) IT PURSUES ECONOMIC 
OPPORTUNITY, BUT SOMETIMES DOES NOT DO ALL IT CAN TO ADDRESS 
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. 
 
------------------------- 
COMMENT: A USEFUL CONTACT 
------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) THOUGH HE IS CURRENTLY OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT DUE TO 
THE MEDIA\'S FIXATION ON HIM AS THE CHIEF SCAPEGOAT OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S SEXUAL ABUSE CRISIS, LAW HAS LONG BEEN 
ACTIVE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND INTERRELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 
AT THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS.  HE IS ALSO WELL 
CONNECTED TO THE AMERICAN VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY THROUGH HIS 
MINISTRY TO THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES OF BOSTON.  HE IS A 
MEMBER OF THE PONTIFICAL CONGREGATION FOR THE EASTERN 
CHURCHES, THE CONGREGATION FOR CATHOLIC EDUCATION, AND THE 
    PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR THE FAMILY, AMONG OTHER VATICAN 
STRUCTURES.  ALTHOUGH HE SPENDS SOME TIME IN ROME IN 
CONNECTION WITH HIS WORK WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS, HE NOW 
LIVES PERMANENTLY IN MARYLAND, AND COULD BE A USEFUL CONTACT 
FOR DRL/IRF.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) In a meeting requested by the Holy See, Vatican 
Foreign Minister Giovanni Lajolo told the Ambassador the 
Sudanese Catholic bishops were in a position to play an 
important role in the North-South peace process.  In fact, 
according to Lajolo, their participation in reconciliation 
efforts and the reform of the constitutional and legal system 
is crucial to the possibility of long-term success.  Lajolo 
expressed the Holy See\'s concern for the humanitarian crisis 
in Darfur and the Church\'s desire to facilitate internally 
displaced person (IDP) and refugee returns there and 
elsewhere in Sudan.  The Holy See hopes that a nudge from the 
USG might prompt greater GOS openness to participation by the 
Sudanese bishops in all these endeavors.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Bishops Could be Crucial in North-South Peace Process 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2. (SBU)  In previous reporting on the Holy See and Sudan, 
Post has noted the Vatican\'s desire that the Sudanese 
Catholic bishops be involved in interreligious dialogue -- 
and its belief that they are in a position to play a 
constructive role (reftels).  In a February 17 meeting with 
the Ambassador, Holy See Foreign Minister Giovanni Lajolo 
again emphasized the potential usefulness of the Catholic 
Church on the issue, noting that the Church could contribute 
to a \"reconciliation of the factions in the South.\"  Lajolo 
added a sense of urgency to the subject we had not heard 
previously, underscored by the fact that he requested the 
meeting with the Ambassador specifically to speak about 
Sudan.  He said the GOS was not consulting adequately with 
the Sudanese bishops, who had been left out of the loop on 
many issues.  In particular, Lajolo said, the bishops should 
be involved in the reform of Sudan\'s constitution and legal 
system.  In this, and other issues, a non-paper Lajolo passed 
(complete text passed to EUR/WE) noted that \"the Church must 
be involved in the preparatory stages (of reform planning).\" 
Further, \"special attention should be given to the question 
of the juridical definition of the Church, which cannot be 
understood as a NGO.\"  According to Lajolo, these subjects 
could have a significant impact on religious freedom issues. 
 
------------------------------- 
Holy See Concerned About Darfur 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Lajolo emphasized the Holy See\'s concern about the 
situation in Darfur, noting the humanitarian cost of the 
conflict.  Lajolo noted that there were few Christians in the 
region, but said that factor did not diminish the Holy See\'s 
attention to the human suffering in the area.  The non-paper 
stated that \"humanitarian corridors\" were no longer 
sufficient to ease human suffering in Darfur, and that \"the 
parties, especially the Government of Khartoum, should be 
persuaded to undertake peace initiatives.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Church Anxious to be Involved; Hopes for USG Nudge 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (SBU) Ambassador noted the USG\'s commitment to peace in 
Sudan and our agreement that the Darfur situation was serious 
both from a humanitarian point of view and because of the 
threat it posed to progress in the North-South peace process. 
 Lajolo told the Ambassador that while the Church\'s efforts 
on behalf of peace and reconciliation would be most effective 
in the North-South dispute rather than in Darfur, the Holy 
See wanted to contribute to reconciliation in any way it 
could.  His memorandum noted that the Church \"especially 
desires to assist in the return of (IDPs and) refugees.\" 
With the Holy See having already impressed upon the Sudanese 
 
bishops and the GOS the importance of cooperation and 
dialogue (reftels), the Vatican\'s contact with Post at the 
ambassadorial level signals the Holy See\'s seriousness on the 
issue, and its belief that a nudge from the USG might prompt 
the GOS to be more open to participation by the Sudanese 
bishops in these various endeavors.

SUBJECT:  HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION TRAINING PROGRAM UP 
AND RUNNING 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.(U) Embassy Vatican\'s anti-trafficking training 
program for women religious, developed with the support of 
G/TIP and EUR and in coordination with the International 
Organization for Migration, completed its first session 
February 6. The program successfully equipped 30 members of 
religious women\'s congregations (nuns) from Italy, Nigeria, 
Poland, Spain, Tanzania, Romania and Mexico for anti- 
trafficking field work.  This \"pilot\" program, which 
provides comprehensive preparation for religious workers 
active in preventing trafficking and dealing with its 
consequences, is the first of four funded through PRM. 
Subsequent sessions are scheduled for the spring in 
Albania, Nigeria and Romania -- major source and transit 
countries for trafficking in women.  Embassy appreciates 
the support of PRM, EUR and G/TIP in implementing this 
initiative. 
 
----------------------- 
From Dialogue to Action 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) Participants in Embassy Vatican\'s May 2002 
International Conference on \"21st Century Slavery -- the 
Human Rights Dimension to Trafficking in Human Beings,\" 
agreed that faith-based organizations needed to do more to 
combat trafficking.  To build on this consensus and move 
from dialogue to action, Embassy decided to tap into the 
potential offered by religious orders active at the grass 
roots level worldwide to build the numbers of people 
actively engaged in anti-TIP work.  Joining forces with the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM), and with 
funding from PRM, Post oversaw the development of a pilot 
training program for women religious.  The initial two-week 
program took place in Rome, Italy from January 29 thru 
February 6, training women from seven countries on three 
continents. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Curriculum Prepares for Field Work 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.(U) Classroom sessions focused on the phenomenon of 
trafficking and on self-help skills for those taking up 
anti-trafficking work, including general information on 
trafficking and law enforcement; profile of victims; health 
care for victims; prevention; how to relate to victims; the 
empowerment of victims; and protection from burn-out among 
those working with victims.  Each topic was teased out into 
operational skills to make it practical for participants. 
After extensive classroom time, the program also exposed 
participants to the reality of trafficking through field 
visits to victims\' refuge centers and by shadowing 
personnel working directly with trafficked women forced 
into prostitution.  The evaluation session at the end of 
the program allowed participants to assess content, 
tutoring and relevance, and the results suggest the program 
was hugely successful.  Some participants observed that 
attendance should be compulsory for any female member of a 
faith-based community engaging in anti-trafficking work. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Media Coverage Magnifies the Message 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.(U) Beyond its direct training impact, the program 
received significant media coverage, which magnified the 
anti-trafficking message and reinforced the U.S. commitment 
to combating this affront to human dignity. 
The Ambassador attended the opening and closing sessions 
and addressed the students, emphasizing the importance of 
their contribution to ending this modern day slavery. 
Media interviews with the Ambassador, IOM lecturers, and 
participants were reported internationally in Vatican- 
related media.  Holy See officials in Rome and abroad have 
expressed interest in the program.  The Papal Nuncio in 
Lithuania, noting his concern for trafficking in the Baltic 
States, has asked for further details about the training 
program for possible implementation there. 
 
----------------------------- 
Comment: Potential for Growth 
 
 
----------------------------- 
 
5.(U) The pilot anti-TIP training program has proven the 
value of the anti-trafficking partnership between the USG 
and faith-based communities.  The participants from female 
religious orders showed a remarkable commitment to 
prevention and victim care.  They will be catalysts for 
their larger communities, and will likely ensure that anti- 
trafficking in persons goals are included in their orders\' 
vision and strategy for the coming years.  With more than 
800,000 nuns worldwide, the potential pool of workers for 
the anti-trafficking field is enormous.  Our program, 
developed in collaboration with the IOM, has already 
sparked interest from Asia and South America.  Embassy 
believes this PRM investment is paying out handsomely, and 
we look forward to working with PRM, EUR and G/TIP to 
ensure its expansion and continued success.  End comment.

SUBJECT: IRAQ: VATICAN SEES NO NEED TO RUSH ELECTIONS 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES, D. BRENT HARDT.  REASONS: 
1.5 (B) AN D (D). 
 
1. (C) HOLY SEE COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR IRAQ FRANCO 
COPPOLA TOLD US FEBRUARY 23 THAT THE VATICAN WAS FULLY 
    SUPPORTIVE OF THE RECENTLY-ANNOUNCED DECISION THAT IRAQI 
ELECTIONS WOULD NOT BE HELD BY JUNE 30.  HE SAID THE U.S. AND 
THE COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY (CPA) SHOULD \"TAKE ALL 
THE TIME THEY NEED\" TO PREPARE THE COUNTRY FOR DEMOCRATIC 
RULE.  THE HOLY SEE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS NO SIMPLE 
PROCESS -- SADDAM WAS NOT A MERE \"PARENTHESIS OF 
DICTATORSHIP\" IN AN OTHERWISE RICH IRAQI HISTORY OF 
DEMOCRACY.  WITH NO SUCH TRADITION IN THE NATION, COPPOLA 
SAID IT REMAINED A PRIORITY TO STABILIZE THE COUNTRY, ENGAGE 
THE POPULATION, AND ACHIEVE A GENERAL CONSENSUS SUPPORTIVE OF 
THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BEFORE HOLDING ELECTIONS.  IN A 
PERFECT WORLD, HE ADDED, IRAQ WOULD BE READY FOR ELECTIONS 
RIGHT AWAY -- BUT THAT IS NOT REALISTIC.  HE BELIEVED THE 
RISK OF GOING TOO QUICKLY WAS FAR GREATER THAN THAT OF GOING 
TOO SLOWLY. 
 
2. (C) THOUGH COPPOLA REMAINED SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. 
POLICY IN POST-WAR IRAQ, HE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE 
SPECIFICS OF THE PLANNED TRANSFER OF SOVEREIGNTY TO THE IRAQI 
PEOPLE ON JUNE 30.  WHAT WOULD HAPPEN, HE WONDERED, IF AFTER 
JUNE 30 THE IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL PASSED LEGISLATION 
INIMICAL TO RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OR OTHER KEY VATICAN AND USG 
CONCERNS? 
 
3. (U) COPPOLA WAS APPRECIATIVE OF THE USAID REPORT ON 
EVIDENCE OF MASS GRAVES IN IRAQ THAT WE PASSED TO HIM, AND

Summary and Guidance Request 
---------------------------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  The Holy See requested U.S. support in encouraging 
the Government of Italy and other interested parties to 
support the inclusion of the Italy-Somalia Forum for Peace 
and Reconstruction in the Somali peace negotiations.  In a 
February 25 meeting with poloff, Vatican Country Director for 
Somalia Lucio Sembrano described the current state of the 
Somali peace negotiations as critical.  Sembrano urged the 
U.S. to reassure Ethiopia and Somalia\'s other neighbors that 
a stable Somali government was in their best interest, and 
that they should support the ongoing negotiations.  We 
understand that this reflects current USG policy.  Please see 
guidance request at para. 6.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Vatican: Situation Urgent... 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  Vatican Country Director for Somalia Lucio 
Sembrano told us February 25 that the Holy See considered the 
Somali peace negotiations to be at a critical juncture, and 
requested U.S. support on two fronts.  As an indication of 
the urgency with which the Vatican sees the situation, 
Sembrano noted that the Vatican had intended to have its 
Foreign Minister raise the situation with the Ambassador, but 
instead decided to contact poloff to convey the information 
as soon as possible. 
 
----------------- 
...and Precarious 
----------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  Both Sembrano and a non-paper he passed us (faxed 
to AF/E and EUR/WE) noted the precarious state of current 
negotiations, noteworthy progress notwithstanding.  The Holy 
See ascribes some of the difficulty in making further 
progress to the exile of former Somali officials and 
intellectuals over ten years ago.  According to the Vatican 
non-paper, this left the nation with a \"total lack of human 
resources and professional skills which are absolutely 
necessary for the success of any lasting and sustainable 
peace-making and reconstruction plan.\"  With current plans 
underway for appointments to a Somali parliament, the Holy 
See believes now is the time to involve a wider array of such 
people in the negotiating process. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Italy-Somalia Forum Should Have Role 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (SBU)  According to the Holy See, the Italy-Somalia Forum 
for Peace and Reconstruction should have a role in the peace 
talks and in negotiations on the development of Somalia\'s 
transitional government.  The Vatican\'s non-paper reports 
that the Forum developed its own initiative to mediate among 
the various groups participating in the talks -- a process 
that showed great promise.  The Forum has reportedly involved 
and mobilized \"the best intellectual and professional 
Somali(s),\" most of whom are living in exile.  The Holy See 
believes it could be a useful tool for the international 
community in the reconstruction of Somalia, and concludes 
that the Forum\'s involvement \"cannot be postponed 
indefinitely\" and should be implemented in the shortest 
possible time. 
 
-------------------------- 
Holy See Requests USG Help 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  The Holy See asked for U.S. assistance in two 
ways: 
 
 
-- According to Sembrano, the Government of Italy has been 
lukewarm on the Forum\'s involvement in the Somali crisis. 
The Holy See requests that the U.S. approach the GOI and 
other relevant members of the international community to 
encourage their support of Forum participation in the peace 
negotiations. 
 
-- The Holy See also encouraged USG contact with the 
Government of Ethiopia to impress upon the GOE that Somali 
reconstruction is in its own long-term interest.  The Vatican 
asked the USG to encourage the GOE and other Somali neighbors 
not to disrupt Somali peace efforts.  Post understands the 
USG is already engaged on this front and is attempting to 
work with the international community to address the GOE\'s 
legitimate security concerns, while still making the point 
that a stable government in Somalia will be good for Ethiopia 
(ref a). 
 
---------------- 
Guidance Request 
---------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  Post is attempting to get more information on 
Forum membership and modus operandi from its leadership in 
Rome that we will forward to Department (ref a).  We are also 
in contact with Embassy Rome on the issue (ref b).  Post 
requests guidance from Department to respond to the Holy See 
on the two issues raised in paragraph 5.

REPORTS FROM NGOS THAT MARAUDING GANGS IN THE REGION MAY HAVE 
USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON THEIR VICTIMS.  ACCORDING TO 
SEMBRANO, WITNESSES HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF SUCH WEAPONS ON 
VICTIMS\' BODIES.  SEMBRANO ALSO EMPHASIZED THE HOLY SEE\'S 
VIEW THAT WIDER PARTICIPATION IN THE DARFUR TALKS WOULD HELP 
CREATE A MORE STABLE PEACE SETTLEMENT.  HE SAID IT MIGHT 
ENCOURAGE BUY-IN TO THE AGREEMENT FROM SOME SEEKING TO

RESETTLEMENT IN DARFUR, SEMBRANO SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS 
WORKING THROUGH ITS DEVELOPMENT ARM, COR UNUM, WITH THE UN 
HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR).  WHEN PRESSED FOR 
WHAT OTHER CONCRETE ASSISTANCE THE HOLY SEE COULD GIVE TO 
SUCH EFFORTS (REF A), HE SAID IT WAS SOMEWHAT LIMITED. 
SEMBRANO NOTED THAT SOME TWENTY CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES WERE

COMMUNICATION FROM THE GOS TO THE CHURCH.  HE SAID THE GOS 
HAS RELEGATED THE CHURCH TO A STATUS SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT OF AN

    WERE READY TO WORK ACTIVELY WITH A PROVISIONAL

POWER.  THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE IS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH

2. (SBU) THE HOLY SEE\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER PIETRO 
PAROLIN TOLD THE DCM MARCH 4 THAT THE HAITIAN BISHOPS AND 
THE VATICAN NUNCIO WERE READY TO WORK WITH A NEW 
TRANSITIONAL HAITIAN ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE A PEACEFUL 
RESTORATION OF ORDER.  PAROLIN SAID THE PAPAL NUNCIO TO 
HAITI HAD BEEN IN ROME DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE CRISIS BUT 
HAD NOW RETURNED TO PORT-AU-PRINCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO 
HELP FACILITATE THE TRANSITION AND WORK WITH THE BISHOPS TO 
ENCOURAGE CALM AND PATIENCE AMONG THE HAITIAN PEOPLE.  THE 
DFM EXPRESSED INTEREST IN LATEST DEVELOPMENTS ON THE 
GROUND, AND ASKED ABOUT THE NEWS REPORTS ABOUT ARISTIDE\'S 
CLAIMS OF BEING FORCED TO RESIGN, WHICH DCM EMPHASIZED HAD 
NO BASIS IN FACT.  PAROLIN VOICED NO REGRET AT ARISTIDE\'S 
DEPARTURE, NOTING THAT THE FORMER PRIEST HAD BEEN AN ACTIVE 
PROPONENT OF VOODOO. 
 
------------------------- 
IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO GO 
------------------------- 
 
    3.  (SBU) EVEN BEFORE ARISTIDE\'S DEPARTURE, POPE JOHN PAUL 
II HAD APPEALED TO HAITIANS \"TO MAKE THE COURAGEOUS 
DECISIONS THEIR COUNTRY REQUIRED,\" AND HAD URGED THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND AID ORGANIZATIONS TO DO WHAT 
THEY COULD TO AVERT A GREATER CRISIS.  THIS WAS SEEN AS A 
VEILED REFERENCE TO ARISTIDE\'S LEAVING POWER.  SINCE 
FEBRUARY 29, THE VATICAN HAS HAD NO OFFICIAL PUBLIC COMMENT 
ON ARISTIDE\'S RESIGNATION; HOWEVER, THE VATICAN\'S CARIBBEAN 
AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONSIGNOR GIORGIO LINGUA SAID THAT THE 
HOLY SEE SAW NO OTHER WAY OUT OF THE CRISIS AND THOUGHT THE 
FORMER PRIEST HAD TO GO.  LINGUA SAID MARCH 3 THAT IT WAS 
IMPORTANT THAT AN INTERNATIONAL FORCE QUICKLY RESTORE ORDER 
IN HAITI SO THAT A PEACEFUL GOVERNMENTAL TRANSITION COULD 
TAKE PLACE.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT A POLITICAL SOLUTION 
SHOULD NOT BE IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE.  LINGUA SAID HE SAW 
SEVERAL HOPEFUL SIGNS THAT THE TRANSITION COULD OCCUR 
WITHOUT A BLOOD BATH, POINTING OUT THAT REBEL LEADER GUY 
PHILIPPE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED TO STAND DOWN AND 
ESCHEW POLITICAL POWER IN LINE WITH HIS INITIAL PROMISE 
THAT HIS SOLDIERS WOULD COOPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL

SUBJECT: VATICAN OPPOSED TO BRAZILIAN SEXUAL ORIENTATION 
RESOLUTION 
 
1.(SBU) Reasoning that people \"who could be victims of 
discrimination on the basis of their \'sexual orientation\' 
are already protected by international frameworks currently 
in force,\" the Holy See signaled its opposition to CHR-60, 
the Brazilian resolution on sexual orientation.  A note 
verbale delivered to the Embassy March 4 (French text faxed 
to EUR/WE) warned that the resolution seemed to be \"a 
preliminary step forward for legitimizing the claim of 
certain homosexual persons to marriage and the adoption of 
children.\"  The Vatican emphasized that its position on the 
issue was \"by no means intended to...support discrimination 
against homosexual persons,\" but instead meant to safeguard 
human dignity and the family, \"founded on marriage between 
a man and a woman.\"  An accompanying non-paper (also faxed 
to EUR/WE) said that the resolution would \"clash with legal 
systems, with the culture, and religious traditions of the 
vast majority of member countries of the United Nations.\" 
 
2.  (SBU) In its non-paper, the Holy See asserted that the 
resolution was aimed not so much at protection from 
discrimination as at the promotion of \'sexual orientation\' 
as an interpretive tool of human rights.\"  Further, 
according to the Holy See, the lack of an \"agreed 
definition of \'sexual orientation\' in any consensually 
accepted instrument\" of the U.N. was problematic.  \"Were 
the proposed resolution to be in fact introduced,\" the non- 
paper continued, \"it should use only \'UN agreed language,\' 
should be limited to encouraging the application of the 
existing international law on non-discrimination, and 
should not require...new studies or comments with a view to 
modifying international legislation on non-discrimination.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) Begin text of unofficial English translation of 
note verbale: 
 
The Secretary of State, Section for the Relations with 
the States, extends its regards to the U.S. Embassy to the 
Holy See and the honor of making reference to the project 
of Resolution related to human rights and \"sexual 
orientation,\" which was introduced in 2003, during the 59th 
session of the Human Rights Commission of the United 
Nations.  As is known, lack of time and strong opposition 
met this project, and the Commission decided to propose its 
examination during the 60th session which will be held in 
Geneva, from March 15 to April 23, 2004. 
 
The Secretary of State has the honor of communicating 
the following related to this project which, in 2004, is 
currently in the agenda (order of the day) relating to 
discrimination: 
 
1) The Holy See enters into partnership with the countries 
opposed to this project.  For the first time, at the 
heart of the United Nations, a Resolution will include 
\"sexual orientation\" among the causes of discrimination. 
According to this idea which is voluntarily undefined, 
this Resolution seems to be a preliminary step forward 
for legitimizing the claim of certain homosexual persons 
access to marriage and the adoption of children. 
 
2) As one can read in the note attached, from the legal 
perspective, this project goes beyond the actual 
international norms related to human rights as well as 
almost all national legislation.  The persons who could 
be victims of discrimination, on the basis of their 
\"sexual orientation,\" are already protected by the 
international frameworks already in force. 
 
 
3) One does not then see how one can include \"sexual 
orientation\" among the causes of discrimination.  The 
approval of this project will require from the rest a 
precedent in favor of those who seek to push/force the 
norms in force.  Although certain documents of regional 
Groups consider the same orientation a cause of 
discrimination, one can not see in this Resolution 
project in question that it will be held to conform to 
those documents. 
 
 
4) The present considerations of the Holy See are by no 
means intended to impose a view of faith, nor support 
discrimination towards homosexual persons, but only to 
offer an impartial service to the international 
community, to better guarantee the dignity of all human 
beings and the family, founded on marriage between a man 
and a woman. 
 
The Secretary of State takes this opportunity to again 
offer to the US. Embassy to the Holy See the assurance of 
its highest esteem.

EUROPE\'S CHRISTIAN ROOTS IN THE EU CONSTITUTION. 
NEVERTHELESS, THE HOLY SEE HAS CONTINUING CONCERNS WITH 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN TURKEY, PARTICULARLY THE LACK OF 
JURIDICAL STATUS FOR THE EXERCISE OF RELIGIOUS RIGHTS.  THE 
POPE REINFORCED THESE CONCERNS WHEN THE NEW TURKISH 
AMBASSADOR PRESENTED HIS CREDENTIALS THIS MONTH.  AMBASSADOR 
DURAK SUBSEQUENTLY TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
WAS NOW \"THE MAIN ISSUE\" IN TURKEY-HOLY SEE RELATIONS, BUT HE 
MAINTAINED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT TREATED ADHERENTS ALL FAITHS 
EQUALLY, AND WITHOUT  DISCRIMINATION.  THE VATICAN HAS TOLD 
US PRIVATELY THAT TURKEY WOULD SATISFY THE HOLY SEE\'S 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CONCERNS BY FULLY MEETING THE EU\'S 
COPENHAGEN CRITERIA.  SUCH STEPS, COUPLED WITH THE HOLY SEE\'S 
GROWING INTEREST IN OUTREACH TO THE MUSLIM WORLD AND ITS 
ONGOING CALLS FOR RELIGIOUS UNDERSTANDING, MAKE IT UNLIKELY 
THAT THE HOLY SEE WILL VOICE ANY OPPOSITION TO TURKEY\'S 
CANDIDACY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------- 
TURKEY: COMPATIBLE WITH THE EU? 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) HOLY SEE COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR TURKEY JAN PAWLOWSKI 
TOLD US MARCH 5 THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD NO OBJECTIONS TO EU 
    MEMBERSHIP FOR TURKEY, AS LONG AS THE GOT FULLY SATISFIED THE 
EU\'S COPENHAGEN CRITERIA ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE VATICAN\'S POSITION SURFACED LAST YEAR WHEN THEN 
VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN SUGGESTED THERE 
SHOULD BE GEOGRAPHICAL LIMITATIONS ON EUROPE, IMPLYING THAT 
TURKEY SHOULD NOT MAKE THE CUT FOR EU EXPANSION.  TAURAN HAD 
ALSO STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF EUROPEAN (READ: CHRISTIAN) 
VALUES IN THE NEW EUROPE.  A SUBSEQUENT VATICAN STATEMENT 
LINKING A LACK OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN TURKEY TO ITS EU 
CANDIDACY, COUPLED WITH THE POPE\'S CONTINUING CALLS FOR 
RECOGNITION OF THE CHRISTIAN ROOTS OF EUROPE IN THE NEW 
EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION LED MANY TO BELIEVE THE HOLY SEE WAS 
OPPOSED TO TURKEY\'S EU BID. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM THE ISSUE - NOT GEOGRAPHY OR ISLAM 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3. (C) PAWLOWSKI REAFFIRMED TO US WHAT TAURAN TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR AFTER THE ISSUE CAME UP IN MAY:  AS FAR AS THE 
VATICAN IS CONCERNED, TURKEY IS \"ENTITLED TO JOIN THE EU,\" 
BUT IT SHOULD FIRST IMPROVE ITS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD.  ACCORDING TO PAWLOWSKI, THE VATICAN WAS NEVER 
OPPOSED TO TURKEY\'S EU MEMBERSHIP, AND ITS GEOGRAPHY AND 
PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM POPULATION WERE NOT DISQUALIFIERS IN THE 
HOLY SEE\'S EYES.  BUT, HE EXPLAINED, THE HOLY SEE WAS -- AND 
REMAINS -- CONCERNED ABOUT A LACK OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR 
CHRISTIANS IN TURKEY.  PAWLOWSKI SAID THE HOLY SEE \"THOUGHT 
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO RAISE THE ISSUE\" BECAUSE RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM IS AN IMPORTANT VALUE FOR THE EU.  \"MEMBER STATES 
SHOULD BE AWARE IF A CANDIDATE COUNTRY IS COMING UP SHORT,\" 
    HE EXPLAINED.  AFTER MAKING MEMBER STATES AWARE OF THEIR 
PERCEPTIONS OF CURRENT HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
SHORTCOMINGS, PAWLOWSKI SAID THE HOLY SEE DIDN\'T SEE ITSELF 
IN ANY WAY AS A FINL ARBITER OF EU MEMBERSHIP.  THE VATICAN 
KNOWS HE SAID, THE OVERALL ISSUE IS ULTIMATELY \"NOT FORUS 
TO DECIDE.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CHRISTIAN ROOTS, MULTI-RELIGIOUS SOCIET 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) PAWLOWSKI INSISTED THAT ONE COULD RECOGNIZE TH 
CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE IN EUROPE\'S PAST AND ITS CURENT 
RELEVANCE WHILE STILL ENCOURAGING A HARMONIOS MULTI-ETHNIC, 
MULTI-RELIGIOUS EUROPEAN SOCIETY  \"THE HOLY FATHER HAS 
ALWAYS SAID THAT EUROPEANSOCIETY MUST BE INCLUSIVE, AND 
WELCOME THE STRANER,\" HE SAID.  PAWLOWSKI CONTENDS HAT THIS 
INCLUSIVITY HOLDS TRUE FOR THE ACCESSIONOF A PRIMARILY 
MUSLIM NATION LIKE TURKEY INTO TH EU, AS MUCH AS IT WOULD 
FOR INDIVIDUAL IMMIGRANS OF ALL FAITHS.  (COMMENT:  THE HOLY 
SEE FINDS TSELF IN A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT HERE.  PAPAL

EUROPEAN CULTURE, WITH ITS PROFOUND CHRISTIAN ROOTS, AND

ITS BACKYARD DILUTED FURTHER THAN IT ALREADY HAS BEEN.  THE 
    VATICAN\'S GOAL IS AN OPEN, MULTI-RELIGIOUS, AND TOLERANT 
EUROPE IN WHICH THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO HAVE AN INFLUENTIAL 
MORAL AND CULTURAL VOICE.  END COMMENT.) 
 
5. (C) FOR NOW, ACCORDING TO PAWLOWSKI, TURKEY STILL HAS A 
LOT OF WORK TO DO ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE 
HAS HEARD MANY PROMISES, BUT LITTLE ACTION FROM THE GOT, AND 
NOTED THAT THE POPE HAD RAISED RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WHEN THE NEW 
TURKISH AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE, OSMAN DURAK, PRESENTED 
HIS CREDENTIALS RECENTLY.  THE POPE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE 
PRINCIPLES OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WERE ENSHRINED IN THE TURKISH 
CONSTITUTION, BUT SAID THAT SUCH GUARANTEES ONLY BECAME TRULY 
RELEVANT \"ONCE THEY HAVE BECOME PART OF ORDINARY LEGISLATION 
AND THEREFORE OF THE LIVING FABRIC OF SOCIETY.\"  HE ADDED 
THAT HE LOOKED FORWARD TO \"RECOGNITION ON THE PART OF THE 
TURKISH AUTHORITIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE CHURCH\'S 
JURIDICAL STATUS\" IN TURKEY.  THE POPE STRESSED THAT THE 
CHURCH DID NOT \"SEEK SPECIAL PRIVILEGES OR PREFERENTIAL 
TREATMENT,\" BUT MERELY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.  PAWLOWSKI TOLD US 
THAT THE RIGHTS AT ISSUE WERE OFTEN THOSE RELATING TO 
PROPERTY; HE GAVE AS AN EXAMPLE A CONTINUING DISPUTE 
INVOLVING SOME FRENCH PRIESTS IN TURKEY WHO HAD BEEN STRIPPED 
OF THEIR LAND BY A TURKISH COURT.

6.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE VATICAN\'S 
ATTITUDE TO TURKEY\'S EU ACCESSION WITH TURKISH AMBASSADOR 
DURAK WHEN THE LATTER PAID AN OFFICE CALL MARCH 15.  DURAK 
    SAID HE HAD PRESSED TURKEY\'S EUROPEAN CREDENTIALS WHEN HE 
FIRST MET THE POPE IN FEBRUARY, NOTING THAT HIS COUNTRY\'S 
EUROPEAN LAND MASS WAS GREATER THAN THAT OF BELGIUM.  DURAK 
SAID THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUE WAS NOW THE CENTRAL THEME OF 
THE TURKEY-HOLY SEE RELATIONSHIP.  HE INSISTED THAT RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM WAS ALREADY GUARANTEED BY THE TURKISH CONSTITUTION, 
BUT THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WANTED LEGAL MEANS TO SECURE AND 
PROTECT PROPERTY AND \"EXPAND THEIR HOLDINGS.\"  ACCORDING TO 
DURAK, THE GOT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE THE VATICAN 
EVERYTHING IT WANTS WITHOUT \"REWRITING THE CONSTITUTION,\" 
BUT WITH \"SOME ADJUSTMENTS\" TO CURRENT REGULATIONS WAS HOPING 
TO FIND COMMON GROUND.  DURAK\'S DEPUTY TOLD DCM EARLIER THIS

ALSO NOT PROVIDED TO MUSLIM GROUPS BECAUSE OF THE SECULAR 
NATURE OF THE TURKISH CONSTITUTION.

DURAK ON THE EMBASSY\'S ANTI-TRAFFICKING PROGRAMS, ENCOURAGING 
HIM TO ENGAGE WITH THE HOLY SEE\'S DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY ON THE 
EFFORT.  HE NOTED THE RECENT G/TIP/EMBASSY VATICAN INITIATIVE 
TO INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION OF PAPAL NUNCIOS AND BISHOPS\' 
CONFERENCES AROUND THE WORLD ON THE ISSUE, AND THE SUCCESS OF 
THE RECENTLY-LAUNCHED INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR 
MIGRATION (IOM) PROGRAM DEVELOPED WITH THE HELP OF THE 
EMBASSY AND WITH PRM FUNDING (REF B).  DURAK SEEMED RECEPTIVE 
ON THE ISSUE, AND SAID HE HAD SEEN SUCH \"HUMAN SLAVERY\" WHEN 
HE WAS AMBASSADOR IN SAUDI ARABIA FROM 2001-2004.  HE 
    ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE SOME 6 MILLION FOREIGN WORKERS THERE 
FROM VARIOUS NATIONS WHO ARE EFFECTIVELY SLAVES, WITH LITTLE 
OR NO FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT.  ACCORDING TO DURAK, SOME OF THESE 
PEOPLE ARE NEVER ABLE TO EARN THE MONEY NECESSARY TO LEAVE 
SAUDI ARABIA AND RETURN HOME, WHILE OTHERS ARE ACTUALLY HELD 
-- ALMOST PHYSICALLY -- AGAINST THEIR WILL.

SUBJECT: HOLY SEE TAKING SMALL STEPS IN RELATIONS WITH 
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Jim Nicholson for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Cardinal Walter Kasper, the Holy See official 
responsible for relations with the Orthodox Church, judged 
his February trip to Moscow to meet with Russian Orthodoxy\'s 
highest officials \"not easy, but helpful.\"  Kasper told the 
Ambassador that Patriarch Alexei II and Metropolitan Kirill, 
the Russian Orthodox Church\'s (ROC) equivalent of a foreign 
minister, raised the ROC\'s traditional concerns of 
proselytism and relations with Eastern Catholic Churches 
during Kasper\'s February meetings in Moscow.  Though Kasper 
questioned the legitimacy of these well-rehearsed complaints, 
and described a certain Russian Orthodox \"double standard\" on 
religious freedom issues, he nevertheless saw some \"small 
steps\" forward in the encounter and said the Holy See will 
continue to pursue its dialogue with the Russian Orthodox. 
Despite this commitment, obstacles to a closer relationship 
between the two churches persist and will likely preclude any 
major breakthroughs in the near future that would allow the 
Pope to fulfill his earnest desire to visit Moscow.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
\"NOT EASY, BUT USEFUL\" 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) The Vatican\'s senior ecumenical troubleshooter, 
Cardinal Walter Kasper, spent several days in Moscow in late 
February meeting with Russian Orthodoxy\'s highest officials, 
including Patriarch Alexei II and Metropolitan Kirill, the 
Orthodox Church\'s equivalent of a foreign minister. 
German-born Kasper, President of the Pontifical Council for 
Promoting Christian Unity, told the Ambassador March 10 that 
the trip was \"not easy, but useful.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
FIRST STEPS WITH RUSSIAN ORTHODOX FM 
------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (SBU) Kasper began his visit with a February 19 meeting 
with Metropolitan Kirill focused on the prospect of upgrading 
the Ukrainian Catholic jurisdiction into a Patriarchate -- a 
move commensurate with its size and history, but one that 
would be perceived by the Orthodox world as a challenge to 
the Russian Orthodox territorial claims.  The Vatican\'s 
desire to move forward with this shift has been tempered by 
the ecumenical fall-out of its decision in 2002 to raise the 
status of its ecclesiastical jurisdictions in Russia. 
(Comment:  The Russian Orthodox have traditionally challenged 
the connections between the Eastern Catholic Churches and 
Rome, since many in the East feel the churches should be in 
union with Moscow or another Eastern Church, and not with the 
Holy See. End comment.) 
 
4.  (C) Kasper confirmed to the Ambassador the Holy See,s 
desire to move slowly on the Ukrainian issue.  Although 
Kasper put little stock in the legitimacy of Russian 
objections to the Patriarchate, he was not inclined to 
placate the Ukrainians at the risk of upsetting the current 
delicate balance of Catholic-Orthodox relations.  The 
Cardinal also noted the \"significant political motivation\" 
behind the Ukrainian Catholics, desires for a Patriarchate. 
Ukrainian nationalists, he pointed out, saw this as another 
way to pull Ukraine away from Russian influence.  It is 
likely that this political motivation has tempered the 
Vatican,s sympathy for Ukrainian Catholic aims. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
PATRIARCH ALEXEI USES TRADITIONAL RHETORIC 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (SBU) Kasper\'s February 22 meeting with Patriarch Alexei 
II -- his first since taking over the Christian Unity Council 
and the first at this level in four years -- marked a step 
forward for the two churchmen, who have had cool personal 
relations.  The novelty of the high-level meeting, according 
to Kasper, quickly gave way to familiar accusations, with the 
Russian Orthodox leader making his standard charges of 
Vatican poaching on Orthodox territory, and asserting that 
Catholics were trying to convert Eastern faithful \"to Rome.\" 
 
6.  (C) Kasper repeated to the Ambassador what Catholics have 
often said in response to such charges.  There is no way to 
defend them without having specific examples.  As a result, 
Kasper said the two agreed to establish a \"joint commission\" 
of members of the Orthodox and Catholic hierarchies in Russia 
that would examine specific instances of alleged proselytism 
and other issues of interest.  This would allow the churches 
 
 
to move beyond vague accusations.  Kasper said he was less 
than convinced that the commission would become a reality, 
however.  \"In the past, (the Orthodox) have often said they 
would do things, but have not followed through,\" he 
cautioned.  Significantly, Kasper also stressed to Moscow\'s 
Catholics in an address prior to his other appointments that 
they shared their Christian faith with the Orthodox and, in 
effect, warned them against proselytism. 
 
------------------------ 
Orthodox Double Standard 
------------------------ 
 
7.  (C) The need to defend the Catholic Church against 
continued Orthodox complaints of conversion efforts obviously 
rankles many in the Holy See.  Kasper described the Orthodox 
attention to the subject as a \"certain obsession\" in a 
culture that was somewhat paranoid and still trapped in many 
ways in a Soviet mentality.  \"Look,\" Kasper said to the 
Ambassador, \"we don,t want to make Russia a Catholic 
country.  That would be a crazy idea.\"  At the same time, he 
noted that there have been Catholics in Russia for 
generations who want and need a Catholic clerical and 
organizational presence.  At the heart of things, according 
to Kasper, is a double standard applied by the Orthodox. 
\"There are Catholics in the West who convert to Orthodoxy,\" 
he said.  \"We don,t have a problem with that because it,s a 
matter of their conscience.\"  Though you don,t hear the 
Russian Orthodox complaining about their Church gaining 
converts, Kasper said, they \"don,t really believe in 
religious freedom\" in their own territory. 
 
---------------------- 
HOW DOES PUTIN FIT IN? 
---------------------- 
 
8.  (C) When the Ambassador asked if Kasper had President 
Putin to thank for the meeting with Alexei, the Cardinal said 
it was possible.  He acknowledged Putin,s desire for the 
Orthodox Church to play a role in keeping Ukraine within the 
Russian orbit, and the political advantages Putin might gain 
by aligning himself with the Church.  According to Kasper, 
the Orthodox connection probably enhances Putin\'s standing 
with the Russian people, who are thirsting for identity after 
losing the Soviet identity that bound them for the bulk of 
the 20th century.  Kasper wondered aloud how Putin,s 
religious sensibilities would change if they became less 
useful politically. 
 
-------------- 
POSITIVE SIGNS 
-------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Despite the traditional roadblocks in the 
relationship, Kasper did see some positive elements from his 
meetings.  In addition to the agreement on the joint 
commission, the Cardinal was heartened by the Patriarch,s 
firm agreement with the Holy See on the need to defend 
Christian values in the context of Western European 
secularism and both sides willingness to cooperate in 
promoting such values.  They also agreed on academic 
collaboration via a proposed exchange program for faculty and 
students from theological schools. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
COMMENT: DIALOGUE CONTINUES WITH \"SMALL STEPS\" 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
10.  (SBU) Kasper had prefaced his high-level meetings by 
telling Moscow\'s small Roman Catholic community that the 
Vatican had modest expectations for the visit.  The 
German-born Cardinal said \"small steps\" were important -- as 
small as \"exchanging friendly greetings, gestures of 
friendship, (and) showing a smiling face.\"  This is a long 
way from the Vatican\'s real goal of a papal visit to Moscow, 
and reflects the reality of the unflinching Orthodox stance 
on the issues noted above.  In fact, while the Holy See 
officially holds out the olive branch to the Russian Orthodox 
Church, it is disappointed and frustrated with perceived 
Orthodox intransigence.  \"Small steps\" notwithstanding, Pope 
John Paul II\'s oft-repeated utopian vision of a united Church 
in Europe breathing with both Eastern (Orthodox) and Western 
(Roman) lungs looks unlikely to be realized in his lifetime.

Summary 
------- 
 
2.  (C) OSCE Bosnia Head of Mission Robert Beecroft 
emphasized the importance of inter-ethnic reconciliation in 
Mostar for Bosnia\'s future stability during March 23-24 
meetings with the Holy See\'s Foreign Minister and the 
Franciscan order\'s Minister General.  Beecroft made it clear 
that Mostar-Duvno Bishop Peric and nationalist Mostar 
Franciscans had become a hindrance to progress in the city, 
and asked both officials for help in tempering the divisive 
influence of these Mostar Croats.  Beecroft said a high-level 
visit from the Holy See and from the Franciscan Minister 
General to Mostar could enhance the credibility of the 
international community with the Mostar Croats, while 
simultaneously helping promote reconciliation and political 
progress.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Obstruction in Mostar 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (C) In a meeting coordinated by the Embassy, OSCE Bosnia 
Head of Mission Robert Beecroft told Holy See FM Giovanni 
Lajolo that ethnic and religious reconciliation in Mostar was 
critical to the future of the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
(BiH).  Unfortunately, Mostar-Duvno\'s Croatian nationalist 
Catholic Bishop Ratko Peric was proving to be a key 
impediment to reconciliation, Beecroft noted to Lajolo.  In a 
follow-on meeting with Holy See BiH Country Director Joseph 
Marino, Beecroft was more blunt, making it clear that he 
regarded Peric as an obstructionist.  Beecroft noted that 
Mostar\'s Croat politicians had gone so far as to tell him 
that they were getting their marching orders on education 
reform from Peric. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Message of Reconciliation Needed 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Lajolo asked how the Holy See could help the OSCE\'s 
work in BiH, and Beecroft told him that the Church needed to 
spread a message of reconciliation through the Papal Nuncio 
and its bishops.  Beecroft pointed out that he and the 
international community already enjoyed excellent cooperation 
with the Nuncio in Sarajevo and with BiH\'s Cardinal Vinko 
Puljic.  However, Beecroft observed that BiH Croats needed to 
hear a consistent message from all Church authorities that 
their culture was not in danger and that the international 
community did not pose a threat to them.  The Pope, who 
visited BiH in June 2003, has actively promoted 
reconciliation, telling Bosnians they had to \"start afresh\" 
and take to heart the \"sentiments of forgiveness, of 
reconciliation, (and) of brotherhood.\"  He visited Croatia 
the same month and made reference to \"healing the wounds\" of 
the \"cruel war.\" 
 
---------------------------- 
Vatican Eyes Croat Interests 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Lajolo took Beecroft\'s request on board, but asked if 
the Croats weren\'t being asked to sacrifice too much in terms 
of political representation in Mostar.  He and Marino also 
asked why Mostar was the only city with the particular 
formula it has for representation, with Marino noting that 
deviating from the principle of \"one man one vote\" was 
problematic.  Beecroft explained that the High 
Representative\'s decision to prevent the formation of a 
majority block in the Mostar city council may seem unfair to 
Croats, but had become the only way forward after repeated 
failures to deal with what was a unique and critical 
situation.  It was necessary for BiH to make broader 
political progress. Both Vatican officials expressed some 
appreciation for the peculiarity of the Mostar situation. 
Though neither directly criticized Peric, they noted that 
Beecroft\'s concerns were not surprising, and they clearly 
received Beecroft\'s message about the bishop\'s obstructionism. 
 
---------------------------- 
Mostar Franciscans Unhelpful 
---------------------------- 
 
 
6. (C) Beecroft brought a similar message to a March 24 
meeting with Franciscan Minister General Jose Rodriguez 
Carballo, telling Rodriguez that despite good relations with 
the Franciscans in Sarajevo, many of their brethren in Mostar 
had \"accepted the premise that education reform was a threat 
to Croat identity.\"  Beecroft made it clear to the Minister 
General that the Mostar Franciscans\' resistance to the 
international community and their \"willful misunderstanding\" 
of some of its initiatives was a roadblock to progress in the 
city. 
 
7. (C) Rodriguez, who took over only recently as Minister 
General, seemed genuine in his desire to promote 
reconciliation in BiH.  He noted the complicating factor that 
the Mostar Franciscans and those in Sarajevo comprised 
separate provinces of the order, and therefore fell under 
different provincial leadership.  Rodriguez\'s deputy 
explained further that episcopal authority trumped that of 
the order -- the clear implication being that Peric was the 
stumbling block with the Franciscans as well.  (Comment: 
Religious orders have in the past found ways to create some 
distance from their bishops when absolutely necessary, and 
the Franciscans could press for greater freedom from Peric. 
End Comment.)  In any case, Rodriguez said he was planning a 
trip to the region in June and would consider what steps 
would be appropriate to address the situation. 
 
----------------------------- 
Comment and Guidance Request: 
----------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) If past experience is a guide, the Holy See will be 
reluctant to intervene directly with Peric.  Marino has told 
us in the past that unless there is something theologically 
errant going on in a bishop\'s diocese, the Vatican is loath 
to micromanage it.  Still, the Holy See has heard the same 
message on Peric for some time now, and with FM Lajolo at the 
helm, it is possible that the Holy See could consider finding 
some way to shift Peric to another diocese or a position 
within the Vatican. 
 
9.  (C) Technically, Mostar is \"mission territory\" and thus 
not under the normal hierarchical structures of the Catholic 
Church.  As a result, Peric reports formally to the head of 
the Vatican Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, 
whose head, Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe will meet with the 
Ambassador on another matter in the coming days.  Embassy 
will pass along word of Beecroft\'s perspective on Mostar to 
Sepe, and stands ready to convey any additional points on 
this matter that the Department considers appropriate.  While 
we cannot predict what influence Sepe might be willing to 
wield in the matter, we believe it would be helpful to raise 
any U.S. concerns on Mostar with him to cover all relevant 
Vatican bases.

INDIA 
 
 
1.  (SBU) DURING A MARCH 31 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, 
SOCIETY OF JESUS (JESUIT) SUPERIOR GENERAL HANS-PETER 
KOLVENBACH EXPRESSED HIS MOUNTING CONCERN ABOUT RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM FOR CHRISTIANS IN INDIA.  KOLVENBACH, WHO RECENTLY 
RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO INDIA, SAID THAT HINDU FUNDAMENTALISM 
    SEEMED TO BE ON THE RISE IN THE COUNTRY.  IN SOME PROVINCES, 
HE NOTED, POLICE PERMISSION WAS REQUIRED TO BAPTIZE NEW 
CHRISTIANS.  ALTHOUGH THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION HAD DECLARED 
SUCH PROVISIONS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, LOCAL JURISDICTIONS 
SOMETIMES CONTINUE TO ABIDE BY OLD POLICIES. 
 
2.  (SBU) LAW AND CUSTOM ALSO DISCRIMINATED AGAINST CHRISTIAN 
CONVERTS, ACCORDING TO KOLVENBACH.  IN SOME SITUATIONS, 
CONVERTS FACE THE LOSS OF SOCIAL STATUS AND ECONOMIC 
OPPORTUNITY FOLLOWING THEIR CONVERSION.  KOLVENBACH 
CHARACTERIZED THE TREATMENT OF CHRISTIANS IN INDIA AS 
HARASSMENT RATHER THAN PERSECUTION, BUT HE POINTED OUT THAT 
AT LEAST TWO JESUITS HAD BEEN KILLED IN INDIA IN THE LAST FEW 
YEARS IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED ATTACKS. 
 
3.  (SBU) THE JESUITS ARE GENERALLY WELL RESPECTED IN INDIA,

SUBJECT:  RELATIONS WITH JEWS AND ANTI-SEMITISM HIGH ON 
VATICAN AGENDA 
 
REF: A) Vatican 0260; B) 03 Vatican 5190; C) Vatican 1150 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) The Holy See has placed its dialogue with Judaism and 
efforts to combat anti-Semitism high on its agenda, as 
reflected in recent Papal statements, high profile 
meetings, and an increasingly active inter-religious 
dialogue.  Vatican relations with Judaism have been 
steadily improving since the 1960s, and Pope John Paul II 
has made the issue a personal priority, doing more than any 
other modern pope to promote better inter-religious ties. 
Though the uncertain boundaries between religion and 
politics can create challenges to relations, as can 
controversies such as that surrounding Mel Gibson\'s film, 
\"The Passion of the Christ,\" the Holy See is determined to 
weather these tempests and deepen the dialogue.  The Holy 
See is sending a high-level delegation to the OSCE\'s April 
anti-Semitism conference in Berlin.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Combating Anti-Semitism: A Vatican Priority 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Father Norbert Hofmann of the Holy See\'s 
Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews recently 
reviewed with Poloff the Vatican\'s efforts to use its moral 
influence to combat anti-Semitism on a global scale. 
Hofmann, the Vatican\'s pointman on the issue, served as a 
papal delegate to the June 2003 OSCE conference in Vienna, 
which recognized anti-Semitism as a human rights issue, and 
will also be a member of the Holy See\'s delegation to the 
April OSCE anti-Semitism conference in Berlin.  Hofmann 
described his work as a priority for the Vatican, and a 
crucial piece of the Pope\'s broader effort to promote 
religious dialogue and toleration.  Hofmann noted that in 
the framework of the CatholicJewish dialogue, the issues 
of anti-Semitism and of broader relations between the 
religions were inseparable.  Any attempt to enrich dialogue 
with the Jews, he explained, also had to address anti- 
Semitism, since the subject is such a crucial part of the 
Jewish experience, historically and today. 
 
---------------------------- 
Steady Progress in Relations 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Hoffman traced for us the evolution of Catholic 
relations with the Jewish community in recent decades, 
noting that the landscape had changed dramatically since 
the 1950s.  The 1965 Second Vatican Council declaration on 
the relationship of the Catholic Church with non-Christian 
religions, Nostra Aetate, repudiated the historical charge 
that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus and 
initiated a new relationship between the two faiths.  The 
declaration also established the Vatican\'s Commission for 
Religious Dialogue with the Jews, which Hofmann said came 
to be housed in the Pontifical Council for Christian Unity 
as an acknowledgement of the shared roots of Christianity 
and Judaism.  Since this time, numerous initiatives have 
encouraged greater understanding between the two faiths; 
for example, since the 1960s Jews and Catholics have taken 
part in an annual Day of Dialogue to promote tolerance and 
understanding. 
 
4. (SBU)  A series of reforms and directives initiated by 
the Holy See have also addressed the way the laity and 
clergy addresses Judaic issues and the way they are taught 
in Catholic catechesis.  A Vatican document released March 
8 instructing bishops on the exercise of their ministry, 
for example, instructs them to encourage respect for Jews 
in order to combat anti-Semitism.  It also asks bishops to 
ensure that the study of Judaism is on the curriculum in 
their seminaries for priests.  Hofmann endorsed this 
approach, observing that the Holy See seeks to use 
Christianity\'s Jewish roots as a springboard to combat 
anti-Semitism and promote dialogue.  He said such 
initiatives had in fact filtered down to the grassroots 
level of the Catholic Church. 
 
----------------------------------- 
New Impetus under Pope John Paul II 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Following the new openings of Vatican II, Pope 
 
 
John Paul II has made giant strides in combating anti- 
Semitism and in the Holy See\'s relations with Jews, Hofmann 
said.  Under this Pope, the Vatican has used a combination 
of papal statements, education initiatives, and periodic 
conferences to advance its agenda.  The 2000 visit to 
Jerusalem by the Pope, in which he prayed at the Western 
Wall and apologized for Christian contributions to anti- 
Semitism, was a seminal moment in the relationship.  But it 
was far from an isolated gesture.  The Pope had made an 
historic visit to Rome\'s synagogue in 1986 -- the first 
modern-era pope to visit a synagogue -- and has since 
maintained excellent relations with the city\'s Jewish 
community.  [Comment:  Rome\'s Chief Rabbi has invited the 
Pope to the synagogue\'s centenary celebrations later this 
spring.  Hofmann told us March 26 that he was still waiting 
to hear if the Pope would be able to attend.  End comment.] 
More recently, Israel\'s Chief Rabbis expressed their thanks 
to the Pope for his strong condemnation of anti-Semitism 
during a January 16 audience. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Symbolic Events Helpful to Dialogue 
----------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Hofmann said that symbolic events such as the 
January 17 Papal Concert of Reconciliation organized at the 
initiative of the Embassy (ref a), during which Pope John 
Paul II sat flanked by Rome\'s Emeritus Chief Rabbi Elio 
Toaff and Imam Abdulawahab Hussein Gomaa, reflected 
continued growth in the relations with Judaism and the 
shared impetus to battle prejudice.  While music could only 
go so far, Hoffman said, he believed that the similar 
events in other areas could inspire more \"concrete 
collaboration to be carried out in daily life.\"  Similarly, 
gestures such as the Pope\'s March 29 audience with a 
delegation from the American Jewish Joint Distribution 
Committee (JDC) -- which was given prominent coverage in 
Vatican media -- help build trust and understanding.  JDC 
President Eugene Ribakoff told the Ambassador his group 
felt very warmly received by the Pope and felt that he 
understood their concerns as Jews.  \"We were really on the 
same wavelength,\" he said.  As far as JewishCatholic 
relations went, Ribakoff declared that \"this pope has 
changed the Vatican.\" 
 
--------------------------------- 
\"The Passion\" Creates Controversy 
--------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Helpful symbols and dialogue notwithstanding, 
Hofmann told us that controversy could flare quickly in the 
world of inter-religious relations.  He pointed to the 
firestorm that had erupted over alleged anti-Semitism in 
the film \"The Passion of the Christ,\" and recounted the 
recent visit to the Vatican of Abe Foxman of the Anti- 
Defamation League to encourage Holy See officials to speak 
out against the film.  Hofmann said his Council had tried 
to be responsive to Foxman\'s concerns, with Council 
President Cardinal Walter Kasper arranging to reiterate 
Catholic teaching on anti-Semitism in a CNN interview. 
(Comment:  The U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference put out its 
own document seeking to counter potential anti-Semitism 
arising from the film.  End Comment.)  At the same time, 
Hofmann said it wasn\'t the place of the Vatican to condemn 
or praise a movie.  He said neither he nor most Vatican 
officials found the film anti-Semitic - a view echoed 
publicly by the Vatican\'s spokesman March 11 in response to 
a call by Rome\'s Chief Rabbi for Vatican comment.  Still, 
he said the Holy See did understand the fear of some Jewish 
leaders that the film could be used by ill-intended 
individuals to generate anti-Semitism. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Political/Religious Complications 
--------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) In describing other complications for this 
important dialogue, Hoffman pointed to the relationship 
between Judaism and the state of Israel.  He said the 
relationship has often blurred issues that, for dialogue\'s 
sake, should remain separate.  The Holy See\'s criticism of 
Israel\'s security wall, for example (ref b), created some 
tension in the inter-religious dialogue with Judaism as 
well as some frosty commentary from Israeli officials.  The 
Head of Hofmann\'s Council, German-born Cardinal Walter 
Kasper, told the Ambassador in a March 10 meeting that such 
political complications were undoubtedly part of the 
 
 
minefield of inter-religious dialogue.  Kasper warned that 
criticism of Israeli policies should not be mistaken for 
anti-Semitism.  \"I may criticize American or French 
policies, but that doesn\'t make me anti-American or anti- 
French,\" he reasoned.  He agreed with Hofmann, however, 
that policy-based anger at Israeli policies could easily 
slip into morally offensive anti-Semitism.  In fact, Kasper 
suggested the recent rise in anti-Semitism in Europe could 
be traced to growing European outrage at Israeli actions in 
the Palestinian conflict. 
 
--------------- 
OSCE Conference 
--------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Cardinal Kasper will lead the Holy See delegation 
to the OSCE anti-Semitism conference in April, along with 
Hofmann and a representative of the German Catholic 
Bishops\' Conference.  Hofmann said Kasper would make a 
statement reiterating Catholic teaching on anti-Semitism, 
and would likely refer to recent Papal and other Holy See 
statements on the subject, such as a February Papal 
statement at the time of a visit by the American Jewish 
Committee when the Pope stated: \"there is regrettably a 
great need to repeat our utter condemnation of racism and 
anti-Semitism.\"  Kasper might also draw from his own 
September article on anti-Semitism published in the Vatican 
newspaper, L\'Osservatore Romano.  Hofmann told us his 
office had reprinted the article in several languages and 
distributed it to Jewish leaders worldwide. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (SBU) The Holy See\'s official position on anti- 
Semitism is clear and well documented, and in words and 
deeds the Pope has gone far further on the issue and has 
done more to improve the Holy See\'s relations with Jews 
than any of his modern predecessors.  In fact, the Holy See 
has engaged in self-criticism on the subject unimaginable 
forty years ago.  Still, Hofmann acknowledged that pressure 
remains from those who seek further statements of Christian 
culpability in the growth of anti-Semitism, or from 
recurrent debates such as the Catholic Church\'s role in 
World War II diplomacy.  While the Vatican is willing to 
acknowledge the Church\'s share of historical responsibility 
for the growth anti-Semitism, it will not compromise what 
it sees as its core beliefs to placate those who want 
more.  Moreover, the Holy See will continue to react 
strongly against what it perceives as Israeli excesses in 
the Palestinian conflict, risking damage to Jewish 
relations and opening itself up to new charges of anti- 
Semitism (ref c).  Despite these constraints, the Holy See 
has emerged as a determined opponent and of anti-Semitism 
and an active leader in inter-religious dialogue that will 
be an increasingly valuable partner for in our efforts to 
eradicate anti-Semitism.

SUBJECT: HIV/AIDS: COUNTERING VATICAN MISCONCEPTIONS ON 
MEDICINES AND U.S. EFFORTS 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.(SBU) Ambassador and several U.S. pharmaceutical 
executives met April 2 with the heads of three Holy See 
departments to set the record straight on U.S. policy on 
HIV/AIDS and the actions of U.S. drug companies  to 
facilitate the accessibility of HIV/AIDS medicines.  The 
Embassy developed this initiative in response to statements 
of Vatican and other Catholic officials accusing American 
drug companies of excessive profit-making in the developing 
world, and charging the USG with seeking to protect the 
industry at the expense of HIV/AIDS sufferers in Africa. 
The Ambassador outlined the President\'s Emergency Plan for 
HIV/AIDS Relief, and emphasized the administration\'s 
efforts to provide pharmaceuticals that are safe, 
effective, and affordable to those in need of them.  The 
industry reps noted that their companies sold medicines at 
no profit to sub-Saharan African nations and had no desire 
or intention of blocking generic production of drugs under 
their patents in these least developed nations.  They said 
their companies\' price of production of anti-retroviral 
medicines had already been reduced to about a dollar per 
day per person.  Generic producers, they added, had yet to 
prove that they could beat these production costs, but they 
hoped they could; i.e., the U.S. companies have no profit 
goals in Africa.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT 
--------------------------- 
 
2.(SBU) Recent public criticism by Vatican and other 
Catholic officials of excessive profit taking and 
\"genocide\" by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry led the 
Ambassador to arrange a face-to-face meeting between senior 
representatives of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and 
three Holy See departments.  The meeting also offered the 
opportunity for Post to focus the Vatican on the 
President\'s Emergency Action Plan for HIV/AIDS.  The April 
2 meeting brought together Cardinal Alfonso Lopez-Trujillo 
of the Pontifical Council for the Family, Cardinal Javier 
Lozano-Barragan of the Council for Health Care Issues, and 
Archbishop Paul Cordes, President of the Pontifical Council 
\"Cor Unum,\" the Vatican\'s development agency.  Several 
staff also attended from each of the departments, all of 
which deal with HIV/AIDS in some way as part of the 
Catholic Church\'s extensive efforts to deal with the global 
impact of the disease.  U.S. pharmaceutical reps included 
Dick Thompson, Mark Speaker and Lamberto Andreotti from 
Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), and Brian Healy and Susan 
Crowley from Merck and Co., all top executives in the 
industry. 
 
-------------------------- 
President\'s Emergency Plan 
-------------------------- 
 
3.(SBU) The Ambassador began the session by emphasizing 
the scope of the President\'s $15 billion Emergency Plan for 
HIV/AIDS Relief.  He noted that in just over two months 
since Congress appropriated funds for the initiative, the 
Emergency Plan had delivered more than $350 million to 
implementing partners who are fighting HIV/AIDS.  He also 
pointed out to the Holy See officials that U.S. 
contributions to HIV/AIDS relief in 2004 would be 
approximately twice those of all other donor governments 
combined. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
USG Committed to Safe, Effective, Affordable Drugs 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4.  (SBU) On the question of generics, the Embassy and 
industry representatives sought to counter the recent 
misleading reports in the Catholic and secular press that 
the U.S. was seeking to block the production of affordable 
generic medicines to protect its drug industry.  The 
Ambassador said the USG was committed to providing 
pharmaceuticals that are safe, effective, and affordable to 
those in need of them.  We noted that the USG had moved 
ahead at the March Gabarone meeting to develop principles 
for evaluating the quality, safety, and efficacy of generic 
fixed-dose-combination drugs. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
U.S. Companies Focused on Help for Africa 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
5.  (SBU) The pharmaceutical industry representatives 
stressed that they were already offering anti-retroviral 
drugs to sub-Saharan African nations at no profit, meeting 
only the cost of production.  With the substantial costs 
associated with developing new medicines, this was no small 
gesture, they noted.  The reps insisted, contrary to Holy 
See assertions, that U.S. companies were not seeking profit 
in Africa; in fact, they said, it would be easier for them 
to ignore the developing world altogether and focus on the 
West where there was a normal profit margin.  Instead, by 
offering drugs at the cost of production and with the 
introduction of several charitable programs, the companies 
had made Africa a priority. 
 
------------------- 
Prices and Generics 
------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The Merck and BMS representatives further 
explained that they were not seeking to protect what few 
patents existed in the least developed nations.  If 
producers of generic medicine wanted to manufacture 
HIV/AIDS medicines under patent by these companies for sub- 
Saharan Africa, the U.S. reps said they would not stand in 
the way.  But, they said, even the generic companies have 
yet to prove that they can produce these drugs below the 
production cost of around a dollar per day per person  a 
cost that does not account for the substantial costs the 
U.S. companies invest in developing new drugs.   Cardinal 
Barragan noted that even the cost of $365 per year for 
these drugs was unaffordable for most sufferers in the 
least developed countries.  Merck\'s Healy agreed and said 
that was why the Global Fund and the President\'s Emergency 
Action Plan played such a crucial role in purchasing and 
delivering the medicines to those who need them. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) Comments from Vatican officials often make 
headlines worldwide and can affect public perceptions in 
many countries.  The Catholic Church and affiliated 
agencies provide care for 27 percent of HIV/AIDS sufferers 
worldwide, so comments from the Holy See on the subject 
carry significant weight.  Given this involvement, Embassy 
believed it essential to set the record straight on U.S. 
efforts - public and private - to meet this humanitarian 
challenge.  Of course, conspiracy theories and suspicions 
of profit motives die hard; for this reason the Ambassador 
is sending a follow-up letter to Vatican participants 
reemphasizing the key points conveyed (text to be faxed to 
EUR/WE).  The industry reps and Holy See officials 
s 
discussed possible follow-on collaboration in the 
distribution of medicines, perhaps using the infrastructure 
available in some African countries through churches and 
bishops\' conferences.  Though not all of the naysayers will 
ever be convinced of the U.S.\'s efficacy and altruism, the 
ongoing dialogue arising from this meeting should 
contribute to a more balanced understanding of the issue 
and a greater appreciation for U.S. leadership in 
addressing the HIV/AIDS challenge.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Vatican Foreign Minister equivalent Archbishop 
Giovanni Lajolo told the Ambassador April 6 of the Holy See\'s 
mounting frustration with Israel\'s unwillingness to address 
visa and residency problems for religious workers in Israel 
and the Palestinian Territories.  The obstacles faced by 
Catholic religious workers in obtaining the required visas 
and residency permits have created \"great difficulties\" for 
the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem to have contact with 
Catholic faithful in the territories and to train 
seminarians, Lajolo emphasized.  In light of Prime Minister 
Sharon\'s upcoming meeting with the President, Lajolo 
requested U.S. intervention with Israel to encourage action 
to resolve this problem.  Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal 
Sodano had raised the Holy See\'s concerns on Israeli visa 
issues with Vice President Cheney during his January 27 
meeting in the Vatican, asking him to urge Israel to engage 
more seriously with the Holy See to resolve the visa and 
residency concerns.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Vatican Appeal for U.S. Help 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) During an April 6 meeting to discuss Iraq (septel), 
Holy See Foreign Minister equivalent Archbishop Giovanni 
Lajolo told the Ambassador that the Vatican was currently 
having \"some problems\" with Israel relating to visas and 
residency permits for religious workers in Israel and the 
Palestinian Territories.  At present, he pointed out, there 
were at least 138 cases of pending requests for residency 
permits, most of whom have already worked in the region and 
who are simply seeking renewals.  The Holy See has raised its 
concerns repeatedly with Israel, including with President 
Katsav, Foreign Minister Shalom and with Israel\'s Minister of 
Internal Affairs.  Foreign Minister Shalom told the Holy See 
in December 2003 that the difficulties were due to \"Israeli 
bureaucracy and to concerns over security\" -- a position 
repeated by Israel\'s Ambassador to the Holy See.  Shalom\'s 
promise to set up a working group to study the pending 
questions has yet to be followed up.  In the meantime, many 
religious workers are being detained for lack of visas or 
renewed permits, and others are unable to leave the 
territories even for family emergencies out of fear of being 
denied reentry.  In this context, Lajolo said the Holy See 
would appreciate if the U.S. could encourage the Government 
of Israel \"to have more humanity on this point.\"  The 
Ambassador promised to convey the Holy See\'s concerns to 
Washington and advise of any action taken. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Background to the Residency Problems 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) To reinforce his points, Lajolo passed the Ambassador 
a memorandum (text below) detailing the background to the 
current difficulties.  The memo points out that the Latin 
Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which is responsible for Catholics 
in Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Jordan, and Cyprus, 
\"must be able to have contact with its faithful,\" and 
therefore must have the right to train seminarians and 
appoint religious personnel.  Both the Patriarchate and the 
Vatican\'s Nunciature in Jerusalem assume responsibility for 
the religious personnel and their activities in the 
Palestinian territories, the latter issuing laissez-passer to 
the workers.  The Holy See regards Israel\'s citing security 
concerns as a reason for delaying the permits as 
demonstrating \"a lack of regard\" for the Patriarchate and 
Nunciature.  It also notes that the \"Fundamental Agreement\" 
which established diplomatic relations between Israel and the 
Holy See in 1994 recognizes the right of the Church to 
\"train, appoint, and deploy\" its personnel in institutions of 
a religious, moral, educational, and charitable character. 
 
4. (C) The memo details key diplomatic contacts to date on 
the issue, pointing out that President Katsav promised the 
Holy See\'s Secretary of State Sodano \"his personal attention\" 
to the matter of visas during a December 2002 meeting.  In 
July 2003, the Vatican presented Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shalom a pro-memoria again raising the issue of visas to 
religious personnel.  In December 2003, FM Shalom told 
Cardinal Sodano that the continuing difficulties were due to 
\"Israeli bureaucracy and to concerns over security,\" and 
proposed the creation of a working group to examine the 
issue.  In March 2004, the Nuncio in Jerusalem wrote to the 
Israeli Minister of Internal Affairs indicating that the 
 
 
situation remained unresolved and was \"in clear violation of 
a number of points in the Fundamental Agreement.\"  The 
Vatican\'s perception is that Israel appears to be denying 
permits to any religious worker who has worked permanently in 
the Palestinian Territories or who intends to work there. 
This policy, they have concluded, is \"tantamount to impeding 
the provision of pastoral care in the Territories.\"

Comment

5. (C) The continuing visa and residency permit problems have 
brought the Holy See\'s relationship with Israel to a nadir 
not seen since the hopeful launch of relations in March 1994. 
 Israel unexpectedly broke off discussion to conclude the 
outstanding aspects of the Fundamental Agreement in August 
2003, and was actively considering closing its Vatican 
Embassy.  Then, in late 2003, Prime Minister Sharon 
deliberately avoided calling on the Pope during a three day 
visit to Rome in late 2003 despite quiet Vatican overtures 
indicating the Pope would welcome such a call.  FM Lajolo 
indicated that the Holy See would have protested the breaking 
off of negotiations publicly, but believed this would have 
been counterproductive.  He emphasized to the Ambassador, 
however, that there were \"limits to (the Vatican\'s) patience\" 
on this issue, as it was seriously affecting the Church\'s 
ability to meet its pastoral needs.  Lajolo lamented that 
there appeared to be \"a strong anti-church, anti-Catholic 
feeling\" within the Israeli government -- a view echoed last 
week by an NGO group active in Catholic-Jewish 
inter-religious dialogue -- and admitted that the Holy See 
was not sure what it could do to improve the situation.  This 
frustration is reflected in the Holy See\'s statement in its 
memo suggesting it has been placed on an \"enemy list.\" 
Lajolo noted that the Nuncio in Jerusalem had recently 
cautioned the Israeli government that, in ignoring the Holy 
See\'s concerns and repeatedly stonewalling a resolution of 
the residency issue, it was alienating one of its better 
friends.

Text of Vatican Memorandum 
-------------------------- 
 
Begin text: 
 
Memorandum 
 
a.  The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem extends over Israel, 
the Palestinian Autonomous Territories, Jordan and Cyprus. 
It must be able to have contact with its faithful and they 
with it, and to this end the right to train its seminarians 
and to appoint freely its own religious personnel must be 
guaranteed.  The difficulties placed on the religious 
personnel of the Latin Patriarchate are not without negative 
repercussions on the relations between Israel and the Holy 
See. 
 
b.  Israel has always granted residence permits to Jordanian 
seminarians, without any security risk being verified. 
Seminarians and religious personnel are not like any other 
citizens, whose activities in the territory may not be known 
to the Authorities. 
 
c.  Both the Patriarchate and the Nunciature (which grants 
the Laissez-Passer to them) assume responsibility for them; 
to cite reasons of security constitutes a lack of regard for 
the two institutions which sponsor them. 
 
d.  Israel is free to place whatever countries it wishes on 
its enemy list, but Catholics in themselves cannot be 
considered enemies of Israel. 
 
e.  The \"Fundamental Agreement\" (art. 3, sec. 2) recognizes 
the right of the Church \"to train, appoint and deploy\" its 
own personnel in its institutions of a religious, moral, 
educational and charitable character. 
 
12th December 2002:  The Head of State of Israel, Moshe 
Katsav, promises the Cardinal Secretary of State his personal 
attention concerning the question of visas. 
 
10th July 2003:  Israel\'s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Silvan 
Shalom, receives from the Cardinal Secretary of State a \"pro 
- memoria\" which raises, in point number 2, the question of 
the issuing of visas to religious personnel. 
 
11th December 2003:  The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shalom, 
explains to the Cardinal Secretary of State that the 
difficulties are due to Israeli bureaucracy and to concerns 
over security; he proposes the setting up of a working group 
 
 
to study pending questions. 
 
23rd March 2004:  The Nuncio writes a letter to the Minister 
of Internal Affairs (with copies to the Prime Minister and 
the Minister for Foreign Affairs) indicating that, in clear 
violation of a number of points of the Fundamental Agreement, 
the situation had not been resolved. 
 
To date there are at least 138 known cases of pending 
requests for the granting of a residence permit, (89 male 
Religious and seminarians (of whom 66 are Franciscans!) and 
49 Religious Sisters):  the majority of these people have 
already been in the Country for a number of years (some for 
more than 15) and need a simple renewal.  Of the applicants, 
54 come from Asia or the West, and 84 are Arabs from various 
countries.  In particular, it seems that the political line 
taken in recent times is to deny the residence permit to 
those who, in the past, have worked permanently or who intend 
to work in the Palestinian Territories.  That is tantamount 
to impeding the provision of pastoral care in the 
Territories, access to which is now possible only through 
Israel. 
 
From the Vatican, April 6th, 2004.

Summary

1. (c) Holy See Deputy Foreign Minister Monsignor Pietro 
Parolin told the DCM April 8 that the Holy See was committed 
to a successful OSCE Anti-Semitism Conference in Berlin, and 
agreed with the U.S. on the importance of achieving concrete 
results.  To this end, the Holy See will be sending a 
high-level delegation headed by Cardinal Walter Kasper, 
President of the Pontifical for Christian Unity, who is 
responsible for the Holy See\'s relations with Judaism.  While 
the Vatican supported efforts to better integrate 
anti-Semitism into the OSCE\'s work, Parolin expressed concern 
about the capacity of ODIHR to handle the increased workload 
involved in collecting and reporting member state data on 
anti-Semitism.  He also made clear that the Holy See would 
not support the inclusion of a direct reference to Israel in 
the Berlin declaration out of concern that such a statement 
would give Israel a shield to deflect criticism of its 
policies by describing legitimate criticism as reflections of 
anti-Semitism. 
 
------------------------------ 
Committed to Success in Berlin 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (c) DCM delivered reftel points, emphasizing the U.S. 
desire to ensure the Berlin OSCE Conference generates 
long-term political will to fight anti-Semitism and ensures 
the OSCE integrates the fight against anti-Semitism more 
effectively into its daily work.  Holy See Deputy 
FM-equivalent Monsignor Pietro Parolin affirmed that the Holy 
See was committed to the success of the Berlin Conference, 
and would be sending a high-level delegation led by Cardinal 
Walter Kasper, which would also include the Holy See\'s 
technical experts on the OSCE and anti-Semitism issues. 
Parolin said this delegation was an indication of the 
importance the Holy See attached to the conference, and its 
desire for Berlin to produce \"something effective.\" 
 
------------------------------ 
Concerned for ODIHR\'s Workload 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (c) On the issue of collection of hate crime data, Parolin 
said the Holy See supported efforts to step up the collection 
and sharing of data to better identify and combat the 
phenomenon of anti-Semitism.  Its only concern, he stressed, 
was a practical one relating to the capacity of the Office of 
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) to handle 
the potential workload involved in collecting reporting on 
these statistics for all OSCE member states.  In the absence 
of additional resources, he noted, this would be too heavy a 
burden that would negatively affect other aspects of ODIHR\'s 
work. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
No Movement on Direct Reference to Israel 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (c) Turning to the draft political declaration, DCM 
stressed the importance of a strong political statement that 
would give momentum to the OSCE\'s work on anti-Semitism. 
Noting that our Mission in Vienna had relayed Holy See 
concerns about inclusion of a direct reference to the fact 
that anti-Semitism is often manifested in attacks against 
Israel, DCM emphasized that such a statement was well in line 
with traditional Vatican views and should not be seen as 
breaking new ground.  Parolin agreed that it would be hard to 
imagine a Vatican statement on Israel that could be construed 
as anti-Semitic.  At the same time, he said he could imagine 
Israel seeking to use such a declaration to deflect 
legitimate criticism of its policies as anti-Semitic. (Note: 
Cardinal Kasper is also sensitive to this point, having 
emphasized in previous conversations the difference between 
criticism of Israeli policy and anti-Semitism (ref b).) 
Parolin noted that the Holy See was currently going through a 
difficult period in its relations with Israel, principally 
related to visa problems for religious workers in the 
Palestinian territories (septel).  In these circumstances, 
the Holy See was genuinely concerned that criticism it voiced 
pertaining to  bilateral problems could be interpreted as 
anti-Semitic. 
 
5. (c) Parolin said he understood that newer drafts 
 
 
circulating in Vienna were likely to drop this reference.  He 
understood that most EU countries were also opposed to 
including this reference in the declaration.  While he 
appreciated the U.S. point of view, and agreed that 
anti-Semitism could sometimes manifest itself in criticism of 
Israel, under current circumstance, he insisted, the Holy See 
could not support its inclusion in the declaration.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Holy See Country Director for Israel Franco Coppola 
told Poloff April 16 that the Holy See had concerns about 
both the Presidential statement issued April 14 and PM 
Sharon\'s Gaza withdrawal plan.  Coppola said that the USG\'s 
consent for Israel to keep some parts of the West Bank it has 
occupied since 1967 and to deny the right of Palestinian 
refugees to return to Israel left the Palestinians with no 
leverage and left Israel completely \"in the driver\'s seat.\" 
Although he agreed that the U.S. position on the land and 
refugee issues reflected current realities, he said the move 
was bound to sit poorly with the Arab world and with many in 
Europe.  Coppola was also concerned about language in the 
statement that endorsed what he said might be unilateral or 
excessive Israeli military measures.  He acknowledged several 
ref (a) points, such as the positive nature of the decision 
to remove any settlements, and the need for the Palestinian 
leadership to act more decisively against terror.  Comments 
by Catholic officials in the media contributed to a negative 
buzz on the issue.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
Israel in the Driver\'s Seat 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Holy See Country Director for Israel Franco Coppola 
told us April 16 that the Vatican had concerns about the 
Presidential statement issued April 14 and PM Sharon\'s plan 
to withdraw settlements from Gaza.  Coppola acknowledged that 
it was \"unthinkable\" for Israel to withdraw to the pre-1967 
borders, and likewise impossible that Palestinians could have 
the right of return to a future Israeli state.  At the same 
time, he believed that taking these items \"off the table\" 
left the Palestinians with no leverage and left Israel 
\"completely in the driver\'s seat.\"  This was bound to sit 
poorly with the Arab world -- and many Europeans, he said. 
Poloff shared ref (a) points with Coppola and emphasized the 
opportunity that existed for progress with Sharon\'s 
initiative; we pointed out (and he agreed) that the removal 
of settlements would be a historic, precedent-setting 
measure.  In addition, we underlined that the U.S. had no 
intention of prejudicing the outcome of permanent status 
negotiations. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Israel\'s Capacity to Deter and Defend 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Coppola said that further Holy See reaction to the 
plan and the Presidential statement would depend on the 
interpretation of some of the language used.  He was curious 
about the statement\'s reference to Israel as a \"Jewish 
state,\" and wondered what implications that might have for 
religious freedom in the country.  Coppola expressed concern 
over the implications of the portion of the statement that 
emphasized the USG commitment to \"preserve and strengthen 
Israel\'s capability to deter and defend itself, by itself, 
against any threat or possible combination of threats.\"  To 
Coppola, this smacked of unilateral and potentially excessive 
action of which the Holy See did not approve.  Further, the 
section on \"prevent(ing) the areas from which Israel has 
withdrawn from posing a threat that would have to be 
addressed by any other means\" seemed to him ominous and 
vague. 
 
----------------- 
Leadership Vacuum 
----------------- 
 
4.  (C) Coppola also questioned how likely it was that the 
U.S. and others could \"foster...new leadership\" in Palestine. 
 \"You can\'t force leaders on the people,\" he said.  \"You have 
to work with those who already command the allegiance of the 
people.\"  We noted the failure of the current Palestinian 
leadership to meet its responsibilities in reform and the 
suppression of terrorism.  Coppola agreed that Palestinian 
leadership had not done enough against terror and admitted 
that it had not been helpful to the peace process. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Media Plays Negative Catholic Comments 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) Vatican media have picked up some negative comments 
by Holy See officials and other Catholics in the Holy Lands, 
contributed to the public impression of Vatican concern about 
the Sharon Plan.  Cardinal Renato Martino, head of the 
Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and a persistent and 
vocal critic of U.S. policy in the region (ref b), asserted 
that it seemed \"unjust\" for the U.S. and Israel \"not to 
listen to the other side\" given that there were two 
contending parties.  Another Catholic church source based in 
the region was quoted by the widely read Catholic News 
Service as declaring that the plan represented an 
\"overwhelming victory for Israel and a catastrophic defeat 
for the Palestinians.\"  \"The road map is over,\" the source 
added, claiming that \"Peace (in the Middle East) is doomed.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) The Holy See continues to regard the 
Israel-Palestinian conflict as \"the mother of all conflicts\" 
in the region and a source of anti-Western feeling that 
contributes to the growth of terrorism throughout the Middle 
East.  The Vatican also hears a steady stream of reports from 
religious workers active in the Palestinian Territories of 
humiliations endured by Palestinians and hardships facing 
those who work with them.  A group of American religious 
leaders who called on the Ambassador this week noted that 
they routinely had to allot 3 hours for an 8 mile trip to 
attend a meeting outside of Jerusalem.  Even Vatican 
Cardinals lecturing in the area were sometimes turned back or 
harassed at checkpoints.  All of this has contributed to an 
increasingly tense relationship between the Holy See and 
Israel (ref c).  Resolution of current visa and residency 
issues as recently promised by the Israeli government would 
be an important step forward.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Under Secretary Bolton previewed Sea Island G-8 
Summit non-proliferation initiatives for Holy See Foreign 
Minister Giovanni Lajolo May 17, emphasizing the 
President\'s desire to ensure that efforts to address WMD 
threats were a priority for G-8 nations.  Bolton 
highlighted progress in implementing the Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI), including its success in 
interdicting nuclear equipment destined for Libya.  He 
reviewed the status of the Global Partnership initiative to 
address the legacy of the Soviet-era WMD programs, and 
outlined the U.S. desire to close loopholes in the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that created the potential 
for easy transfer from civilian to military applications. 
FM Lajolo asked about the status of Libyan disarmament, as 
well as North Korean, Indian, Pakistani, and Israeli 
nuclear programs.  Lajolo also reviewed his recent meeting 
with 
the Iranian vice-Foreign Minister, who promised the Vatican 
that Iran would completely meet its IAEA commitments by the 
time of the next meeting in Vienna.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
WMD Proliferation in Focus for G-8 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Continuing a regular dialogue with the Holy See on 
international non-proliferation and arms control efforts, 
U/S John Bolton told the Holy See\'s Foreign Minister 
equivalent, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, that the United 
States believes the proliferation of biological, chemical 
and nuclear weapons continues to pose a serious threat to 
global security despite some recent successes.  Given U.S. 
concerns, President Bush had asked that WMD be a primary 
focus of the June 8 Sea Island G-8 Summit.  Bolton outlined 
the G-8 non-proliferation agenda, which would include a 
review of the PSI, an effort to expand the Global 
Partnership (GP), and an initiative to close loopholes in 
the NPT that allow states to pursue fissile material and 
develop expertise for nuclear weapons under peaceful cover. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Proliferation Security Initiative 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) In its first year, Bolton told Lajolo, the PSI had 
resulted in expanded international cooperation to interdict 
shipments of WMD materials and prevent them from moving 
from states of concern to other states or non-state 
actors.  The initiative had scored a major success last 
October when the U.S., working with Germany, Italy, and the 
UK stopped and seized a shipment of centrifuge equipment 
destined for Libya that could have facilitated uranium 
enrichment.  This interdiction, Bolton suggested, may have 
played a role in Libya\'s decision to abandon its nuclear 
weapons programs. 
 
---------------------- 
The Global Partnership 
---------------------- 
 
4. (C) A second objective of the Sea Island Summit, Bolton 
said, would be to expand the Global Partnership against the 
spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction, which 
had been launched at the Kananaskis G-8 Summit in June 
2002, and which had contributed to the destruction of 
missile silos and chemical weapons, as well as to the 
conversion of reactors from highly to low enriched 
uranium.  The U.S. has committed 10 billion dollars to the 
Partnership over ten years, and was looking to its G-8 and 
other partners to come up with an additional 10 billion 
dollars to reach the 20 billion target established at 
Kananaskis.  While preventing dangerous materials from 
falling into the wrong hands, the program would also help 
bring Russia in line with its START and other treaty 
commitments, while allowing for the expansion of programs 
to ensure legitimate employment for weapons scientists. 
Lajolo welcomed this initiative and expressed hope it could 
be expanded to address this threat. 
 
--------------------- 
Closing NPT Loopholes 
--------------------- 
 
 
5. (C) A third priority for the U.S. at Sea Island, Bolton 
explained, would be to build support for an initiative to 
close loopholes in the Non-Proliferation Treaty that allow 
countries to be in full compliance with the NPT while 
acquiring the skills and materials to bring them very close 
to nuclear weapons capability.  The U.S. has tabled a 
number of reforms that we believe would prevent the spread 
of uranium enrichment and reprocessing capabilities.  The 
Under Secretary observed that this has been a controversial 
initiative, and has required the U.S. to explore ways to 
ensure that low enriched fuel can be made available at low 
cost as highly enriched plants are converted.  If the G-8 
can agree on this, it would set an international standard 
that would form a useful foundation for future 
international discussions on closing loopholes. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Iranian Compliance with IAEA Commitments 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) FM Lajolo told the Under Secretary that he had 
recently received the Iranian Vice Foreign Minister, who 
assured him that Iran would be in full compliance with IAEA 
requirements by the time of the next commission review 
meeting in Vienna.  Lajolo also noted that the Iranian 
Minister had complained about what he considered the double 
standards vis-a-vis Iran\'s treatment compared to that of 
Israel and India.  Bolton responded that it is true that 
Iran wants to get off the IAEA\'s agenda and close its file, 
but that they have too much work to do to disclose recently 
uncovered programs to meet this timeline.  He pointed out 
that Iran had agreed with Germany, the UK, and France to 
suspend all uranium enrichment activities in exchange for 
expanded energy cooperation.  Unfortunately, Iran had not 
stopped production of centrifuge components or design work 
for an advanced centrifuge.  Iran is hoping to get off the 
IAEA\'s agenda, and then resume its enrichment work, Bolton 
explained, but he saw no prospect that the file would be 
closed anytime soon given the number of unanswered 
questions about Iranian programs.  Bolton stressed that the 
U.S. was working closely with EU countries on this issue, 
and would continue to work to make all of the Middle East 
free of nuclear weapons. 
 
7. (C) Lajolo also raised the Iranian Minister\'s claim that 
Iran needed the nuclear facility for economic purposes and 
long term energy security.  Bolton pointed out that Iran 
allows four times the amount of energy that would be 
produced at the Bushehr reactor to escape into the 
atmosphere.  Simply by scaling back this waste and loss, it 
would recoup far more than it would gain from nuclear 
power.  Bolton said that revelations of I.Q. Khan\'s nuclear 
dealings left no doubt that Iran is intent on building a 
nuclear weapons program, and will remain a serious 
proliferation problem for some time to come. 
 
----- 
Libya 
----- 
 
8. (C) In contrast to Iran and North Korea, Bolton told 
Lajolo, Libya had recently demonstrated how a country can 
give up its nuclear programs and reap benefits from greater 
international cooperation.  Libya had come to realize that 
its nuclear ambitions were not making it safer, but were 
increasing its risks from international sanction and 
potential military action.  Lajolo asked about the status 
of Libya\'s disarmament process and prospects for a 
resumption of full diplomatic relations with Libya.  Bolton 
indicated that Qadafi had been cooperating fully, allowing 
the U.S. and UK to move all of his nuclear equipment to Oak 
Ridge, Tennessee.  The U.S. and the international community 
had lifted major sanctions and, after resolving some 
remaining issues, it was likely that our relations could be 
upgraded by the end of the year. 
 
----------- 
North Korea 
----------- 
 
9. (C) Lajolo said it appeared to the Holy See that North 
Korea was trying to use its nuclear capability to leverage 
assistance from the West.  Bolton, commenting that this is 
also called blackmail, said it was hard to understand 
exactly what North Korea was after.  Even the Chinese were 
mystified, he noted.  To us, it appears the North Koreans 
want to keep their capability and get western assistance -- 
something the U.S. would not accept.  The U.S. was 
committed to resolving the North Korea threat 
 
 
diplomatically, and we were prepared to meet again in 
Beijing in June if this would be helpful. 
 
--------------------------- 
India, Pakistan, and Israel 
--------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Touching briefly on other nuclear countries, 
Lajolo asked what the U.S. was doing in regard to nuclear 
capabilities in India, Pakistan and Israel.  On India and 
Pakistan, the Under Secretary pointed out that the U.S. had 
been engaged intensively and successfully over the past two 
years to prevent the dispute over the Kashmir from spilling 
over to a nuclear showdown.  Pakistan remained a source of 
great concern in the face of continued assassination 
attempts on President Musharaf and the potential for a 
radical takeover.  On Israel, Bolton observed that the 
Israeli nuclear program offered an ultimate protection 
against being driven into the Mediterranean.  The U.S. did 
not regard the Israeli program as a threat to the region, 
as Israel would never use it unless attacked.  He noted 
that Libya had often cited Israel as an excuse for their 
nuclear program, but now insists that they know Israel 
would not attack unprovoked.  The U.S. goal remained to rid 
the Middle East of all nuclear weapons, but this had to be 
done one state at a time. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (C) FM Lajolo expressed appreciation for Bolton\'s 
briefing on U.S. non-proliferation priorities and 
activities, and affirmed his interest in continuing such 
discussions in light of the Holy See\'s interest in arms 
control worldwide.  U/S Bolton noted that the Holy See had 
always been active in the NPT and an important voice on 
arms control, and he looked forward to staying in contact.

reception by Vietnamese officials.  Authorities allowed the 
delegation to visit the diocese of Xuan Loc for the first

April between police and Montagnards.  Although the 
delegation was \"closely watched\" at times, it was able to 
meet with both religious personnel and laity.  The Holy See 
sees the increased access the delegation enjoyed and 
indications of a growing role for the Catholic Church in 
civil society as signs of progress, but believes more is

Increased Access for Delegation and a \"Cordial\" Reception 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2.  (SBU) A Vatican delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Pietro Parolin visited Vietnam April 27-May 2 for an annual 
meeting with officials of the government\'s Office for 
Religious Affairs and came away pleased by the increased 
access allowed to previously off-limits areas of the country. 
 Vietnamese authorities allowed the delegation to visit the 
diocese of Xuan Loc for the first time, as well as Ban Me 
Thuot, where there were clashes in April between police and 
Montagnards. 
 
3.  (SBU) Luis Montemayor, Holy See Country Director for 
Vietnam, told us May 12 that the increased access came as a 
surprise.  In Hanoi, he said, the delegation had a great deal 
of freedom of movement, whereas outside of the major cities 
the group was \"closely watched.\"  Montemayor nevertheless saw 
the simple fact that the delegation could visit outlying 
areas as progress.  The GOV had not allowed twelve previous 
Vatican delegations to visit Xuan Loc, the largest diocese in 
Vietnam, where, he said, Catholics made up some 30 percent of 
the population.  In Ban Me Thuot, the delegation met with 
laity and with nuns who work with the Montagnards, some of 
whom, Montemayor noted, are Catholics.  Speaking to the 
press, Parolin described the visit to the Ban Me Thuot 
cathedral as \"particularly moving,\" as the delegation came 
upon a church \"packed\" with Catholics who had gathered there 
when word of the visit leaked out.  Montemayor summarized the 
delegation\'s reception by Vietnamese authorities as 
\"surprisingly cordial,\" especially in light of last fall\'s 
flap over the elevation of a new cardinal for Vietnam 
(reftel). 
 
------------------- 
Montagnard Killings 
------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Although the delegation was well aware of reports 
of atrocities in the Ban Me Thuot area, Montemayor told us 
the group had not seen any signs of destruction there.  \"Of 
course, they were hardly going to let us see anything 
sensitive,\" he said, but the delegation did its best to see 
what it could.  In speaking to French diplomats and others on 
his trip, Montemayor could not get a good sense of how severe 
the April violence had been.  \"It\'s very hard to get at the 
truth,\" he said.  Several villages were said to be missing 
people, but total numbers were hard to ascertain.  \"I\'m not 
sure we\'ll ever know exactly what happened,\" Montemayor 
concluded. 
 
--------------------- 
Vatican Sees Progress 
--------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) In another positive sign of GOV openness to the 
Church, Montemayor told us that some local authorities had 
recently asked orders of Catholic nuns to take up care for 
HIV/AIDS patients.  In one location, the authorities returned 
Church property that they had previously confiscated in order 
for the nuns to pursue the project.  To the Holy See, this 
represents an important step toward allowing the Church to 
take its proper place in civil society.  Parolin told the 
press that he hoped that \"with increased dialogue\" the 
government of Vietnam would realize that the Catholic Church 
\"asks only to be able to exercise its mission freely, placing 
itself at the service of the country and its people.\" 
 
---------------------------- 
Comment: \"A Long Road Ahead\" 
---------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) While Deputy FM Parolin and Montemayor were upbeat 
about their reception in Vietnam and the progress in 
religious freedom they had seen there, they noted that many 
concerns remained.  Vietnamese authorities had yet to resolve 
issues relating to restrictions on the naming of bishops, the 
selection of seminary students, and the mobility of religious 
personnel.  Moreover, while the government\'s treatment of 
Catholics was wanting, its persecution of Protestants was 
generally worse, Montemayor pointed out.  \"One cannot deny 
that progress has been made,\" Parolin concluded, \"but there 
is still a long road ahead.\"

 THE AMBASSADOR SAID WE COULD NOT GIVE UP ON WHAT HE 
CONSIDERED PERHAPS THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUE FACING THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TODAY.

SUBJECT: DAS SATTERFIELD REVIEWS MIDDLE EAST AND IRAQ WITH 
HOLY SEE DFM 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Jim Nicholson.  Reasons:  1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C)  NEA Deputy Assistant Secretary David Satterfield 
reviewed U.S. policy in regard to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, Iraq, Middle East reform and Syria in a May 17 
meeting with Holy See Deputy FM equivalent Monsignor Pietro 
Parolin.  Satterfield described the Israeli-Palestinian 
dispute as \"an extremely painful and difficult situation\" 
that has to change.  He outlined how PM Sharon\'s Gaza 
withdrawal plan fit in with the Road Map and offered a 
possibility to break the cycle of violence and hopelessness. 
On Iraq, Satterfield emphasized that the June 30 transfer of 
sovereignty to Iraq would mark a clean break with the 
occupation, and that no later than January 2005 there would 
be a fully empowered Iraqi government in place.  Satterfield 
emphasized the importance of reform in the Middle East, 
noting that the U.S. was encouraged by the tenor of 
discussions at the Arab League Summit in Tunisia in favor of 
a robust, indigenously developed reform program.  On Syria, 
Satterfield made clear that the U.S. believes the time has 
come for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and allow the 
Lebanese people to choose their own government.   End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
MEPP: Repairing the Breakdown of Partnership 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) NEA DAS David Satterfield told Holy See DFM Parolin 
May 17 that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had become an 
extremely painful, difficult situation in which both sides, 
the region as a whole, and the international community had 
been repeatedly frustrated.  The greatest casualty, he said, 
has been a \"breakdown in a sense of partnership\" between the 
sides and a sense of their ability to live together.  The 
consequence of Israeli actions to address their security 
situation has been that economic activity had ground to a 
halt, communities have become isolated, and it has become 
difficult for Palestinians to live normal lives.  This \"has 
to change,\" Satterfield stated.  Parolin said the Holy See 
shared these concerns, observing that the Vatican believed 
the situation in the territories had been made even more 
difficult by the exchange of letters between President Bush 
and PM Sharon on Gaza. 
 
3. (C) Satterfield said the President\'s vision of two states 
sought to offer an end goal for the parties to aspire to, but 
for the past three and a half years there has been a visible 
breakdown between them.  Clearly something was needed to 
break this cycle of political passivity combined with 
violence.  The U.S. believed that PM Sharon\'s unilateral Gaza 
withdrawal plan -- though developed for his own reasons -- 
offered a means to overcome the breakdown.  Noting that the 
plan was popular within Israel, but not in Sharon\'s Likud 
Party, he explained that Sharon had appealed to the President 
to support the withdrawal in order to sway his own party 
members.  The President agreed to do so, but had been careful 
to make clear that all end-state issues, including refugees 
and borders, had to be worked out between the parties.  The 
U.S. was determined to continue playing an honest broker 
role, and would not cross lines that would jeopardize this 
role.  In a situation in which nothing has moved for three 
and a half years, Satterfield observed, the U.S. believes 
that the Gaza withdrawal -- if executed in a multilateral 
framework and in line with the Road Map -- could change the 
negative dynamic in the region. 
 
4. (C) On this latter point, Parolin pressed for more detail 
on how the Gaza withdrawal fit with the Road Map. 
Satterfield pointed out that the Road Map calls for 
progressive Israeli withdrawal from all occupied territory 
linked to Palestinian performance on security.  In this case, 
the Palestinians have yet to meet security goals, but the 
expectation is that Israel\'s withdrawal will compel the 
Palestinians to perform.  In other words, the Road Map would 
be triggered by the withdrawal.  Whatever its origins, 
Satterfield added, the Gaza withdrawal was consistent with 
the Road Map and a two state outcome, and could in fact 
become a model for other areas. 
 
5. (C) Parolin expressed the Holy See\'s concern that Gaza 
would become \"an open air prison\" in light of Israel\'s 
refusal to allow the construction of a port or airport and 
the constant surveillance of the Israeli army.  Parolin added 
that the Holy See also had concerns about ongoing 
construction of a security trench.  Satterfield agreed that 
Gaza could not be shut off from a flow of workers, supplies, 
and economic activity.  He noted Israel has offered us 
 
 
assurances on this point.  Nevertheless, there would probably 
be an Israeli army presence between Gaza and Egypt at the 
outset.  Satterfield praised Egypt\'s active role along the 
border, and also indicated that there could in time be a role 
for the MFO (Multinational Force Observers) along the border. 
 Pressed again about consistency with the Road Map, 
Satterfield indicated that the Gaza withdrawal could not be 
\"Gaza first and last,\" but had to be the first step that 
could bring the two sides together in a constructive 
framework.  The decision, though unilateral, had to be 
implemented multilaterally and would therefore offer an 
opportunity to restart dialogue. 
 
6. (C) Parolin expressed hope that the Gaza withdrawal could 
provide the needed impetus, but said he doubted whether the 
steps taken thus far are the right ones to build trust.  On 
the contrary, he suggested, the Holy See had the impression 
the gap was widening.  The Holy See believes greater pressure 
needs to be applied to both sides.  In the past, he noted, 
impetus for peace had come from outside, and it would have to 
be the same now.  The parties cannot work out peace on their 
own.  Satterfield acknowledged this point, but noted that the 
process had to start somewhere and Gaza could be that point 
of departure.  Parolin said it was critical to recognize that 
not only the Palestinians, but also the Israelis had to meet 
agreed goals if the Road Map was to move forward. 
Satterfield agreed, noting that the U.S. has been blunt and 
direct to both sides. 
 
---------------------------- 
Holy Sites and Visa Problems 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Satterfield said the U.S. fully appreciates the Holy 
See\'s concerns for the implications of the wall\'s 
construction for Holy sites and convents in Jerusalem and 
elsewhere in the West Bank, and has spoken with the wall\'s 
principal designer regarding potential adjustments. 
Satterfield noted that this was a serious issue not only for 
the Church, but for the Palestinians as well.  While the U.S. 
was not opposed to the wall in principle, we were opposed 
where it would negatively affect Palestinian lives and the 
peace process.  Israel has been responsive to some U.S. 
concerns, he noted, but not all.  On the Holy See\'s concerns 
about visas for Catholic religious workers in Palestinian 
territories, Satterfield stressed that the U.S. was working 
with Israel, and that we understood that a resolution was 
being prepared by the Israeli government.  The Holy See\'s 
concerns, he noted, were shared by other NGO\'s working in the 
territories.  The U.S. wants to see full access, and will 
continue to be an interlocutor with the Israelis to this end. 
 
---------------- 
Iraq\'s Challenge 
---------------- 
 
8. (C) Turing to Iraq, Satterfield acknowledged that reaching 
our goal of a unified, prosperous, peaceful and democratic 
Iraq was proving a difficult challenge, but the U.S. was 
moving forward on target for the June 30 transfer of 
sovereignty.  The departure of Ambassador Bremer June 30 and 
arrival of Ambassador Negroponte would signal a fundamental 
break with the occupation.  By January, Iraqi authorities 
would have full power and ability to govern the country.  UN 
Special Representative Brahimi\'s role was critical, 
Satterfield noted, and he has succeeded in reaching out to 
all groups.  Our goal was to ensure the new interim 
government was seen by Iraqis as genuinely Iraqi.  The U.S. 
would retain forces on the ground, and was working to achieve 
agreement on a UN resolution that would provide the basis for 
their continued presence. 
 
9. (C) On Abu Ghraib, Monsignor Parolin asked Satterfield how 
this could have happened.  Satterfield expressed U.S. 
revulsion at these actions and our determination to ensure 
justice is done.  He called Parolin\'s attention to Secretary 
Powell\'s speech in Jordan where he spoke as a soldier of his 
horror and disappointment at the actions of those soldiers 
involved.  Satterfield acknowledged that this abuse was \"a 
blow to America\'s image\" in the Arab world, and assured 
Parolin that we would find out how this happened and take 
steps to ensure it never happens again.  Parolin described 
the scandal as \"very unfortunate\", noting that it had damaged 
broader relations between the West and the Muslim world and 
provided ammunition for extremists. 
 
------------------ 
Middle East Reform 
------------------ 
 
10.  (C) Satterfield said the U.S. had been encouraged by the 
 
 
tenor of deliberations at the Arab League Summit in Tunisia, 
where it appeared the region would develop robust proposals 
that will address issues such as women\'s rights and 
education.  The U.S. was determined to encourage and support 
an indigenous reform agenda.  The U.S. was sensitive to the 
need to support but not dictate the path of reform, and we 
have been pleased with the positive signs we have seen coming 
form the region.   Satterfield noted that this would be a 
central issue at the upcoming G-8 Summit, and was also on the 
agenda of NATO and the OSCE. 
 
----------------- 
Syria and Lebanon 
----------------- 
 
11.  (C) Turning to recent U.S. policy statements regarding 
Syria, Satterfield said the U.S. believes the time has come 
for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and to allow  the Lebanese 
people to be able to follow their own national will. 
Upcoming presidential elections, he added, should not be 
dictated from outside.  Syria remained resistant, however, 
and the situation in Lebanon would continue to require 
careful tending.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.(U) Embassy Vatican organized and hosted a 
conference on Human Trafficking June 17 that brought 
together three key elements in the fight against 
trafficking in human beings (TIP): faith-based communities 
as first responders for victims; the demand factor as a 
causal element in TIP; and the media\'s role in 
consciousness raising.  The \"Call to Action\" attracted 
nearly 200 participants, including senior Vatican and 
Italian government officials (including a former Italian 
Prime Minister), diplomats accredited to the Holy See, 
members of religious orders, and the media.  Attendees 
heard U.S., Vatican and Italian speakers make innovative 
and forceful arguments to educate and energize those 
already committed to anti-trafficking initiatives, and to 
stimulate the uninitiated to action.  Delegates viewed the 
department-recommended film \"Lilya 4-Ever,\" as well as 
extracts from U.S. and European television network 
programming on the issue of trafficking.  Post appreciates 
ECA\'s support for this conference, which garnered extensive 
media coverage helping to enhance awareness and promote 
action against human trafficking.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Taking Action Against Trafficking 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.(U) On June 17, Embassy organized the second of four 
2004 conferences marking twenty years of full diplomatic 
relations between the U.S. and the Holy See.  Held at the 
prestigious Jesuit-run Pontifical Gregorian University, \"A 
Call to Action: Joining the Fight Against Trafficking in 
Persons\" focused on ways in which religious communities, 
the media, and governments could take action to prevent and 
respond to trafficking in persons (TIP).  The conference 
drew a robust and enthusiastic crowd of nearly 200 senior 
Vatican and Italian government officials, diplomats 
accredited to the Holy See, and members of religious orders 
from Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas.  Coming on the 
heels of the release of the Department\'s 2004 TIP Report, 
the conference served to multiply the public outreach of 
this report and the Secretary\'s presentation two days 
earlier.  The Ambassador highlighted the Report and the 
Department\'s priorities in his introductory comments, which 
emphasized the international dimensions of the problem and 
the need for active engagement from the Holy See and its 
worldwide religious communities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Holy See Highlights Role of Faith-Based Communities 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3.(U) In his keynote address, Holy See Deputy FM Pietro 
Parolin called for a multifaceted approach to trafficking, 
which he described as a grave violation of human rights and 
a threat to human dignity.  Parolin identified poverty, 
discrimination and underdevelopment as root causes of the 
phenomenon.  He praised international conventions and 
initiatives, but said that alone they were insufficient to 
tackle the problem, which he asserted would require 
cultural initiatives to affect attitudinal change in 
society.  Parolin pointed out that faith-based communities 
were often in the front line of anti-trafficking work, 
describing them as \"first responders.\"  Parolin urged 
greater collaboration with faith-based organizations, 
presenting Post\'s current project to train women religious 
in anti-TIP work (ref a) as an example of a highly 
successful approach.  He concluded with a call to the media 
to promote positive behaviors and offer a message that 
enhanced human dignity. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Faith-based Communities on Front Line 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.(U) Following Parolin\'s call for further collaboration 
between faith-based communities and governments, German 
Ambassador to the Holy See Gerhard Westdickenberg moderated 
a session focused on the role of religious organizations in 
 
 
the TIP fight.  Italian nun Eugenia Bonetti (a G/TIP 2004 
anti-trafficking hero) and the International Organization 
for Migration\'s (IOM) Stefano Volpicelli gave a detailed 
presentation of a training program for nuns involved in 
anti-trafficking work (ref a).  They made it clear that 
religious workers were logical participants in this work 
because of their vocational choice in favor of the weakest 
and most marginalized members of society.  Moreover, their 
ability to engender trust among victims facilitated their 
engagement.  Sister Bonetti gave examples of how victims 
viewed nuns as unbiased and independent agents, untainted 
by the prejudices and stereotyping that often surrounds law 
enforcement and other government officials. 
 
5.(U) Mary Ellen Dougherty of the U.S. Conference of 
Catholic Bishops office for Migration and Refugee Services 
observed that the rationale behind Catholic social policy 
paralleled goals of secular agencies and governments, 
making partnership logical and effective.  Dougherty 
extolled the strength of faith-based initiatives to combat 
trafficking, noting that they were able to draw on 
extensive networks already in place.  Faith-based 
communities\' access to a broad range of interested groups, 
organizations and individuals and their genuine \"staying 
power\" - their ability to remain committed and effective 
even continuous funding streams -- gave them unique 
strengths to wage a consistent battle against trafficking, 
she emphasized.  According to Dougherty, the Catholic 
Church and other religious organizations had three 
e 
distinctive roles to play in the fight against trafficking: 
education (with the hierarchy or other religious leaders 
providing credibility and weight to anti-trafficking work); 
services to victims; and coalition building.  In a day in 
which participants heard many troubling stories, Dougherty 
also emphasized the positive, pointing out the significant 
increase in the number of people at all levels dedicated to 
the fight against trafficking. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Confronting the Demand Side of TIP 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.(U) Ambassador Desire Koumba of Gabon moderated the 
second session on the demand side of trafficking, noting 
the particular interest that he and his government took in 
TIP.  Donna Hughes, Professor of Women\'s Studies at the 
University of Rhode Island and author of a Department- 
sponsored TIP study, joined Dorchen Leidholdt, Executive 
Director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, to 
present their hypothesis that demand, including legal 
prostitution, generated and exacerbated trafficking in 
women for sexual exploitation.  Both speakers urged the 
adoption of legal sanctions against \"exploiters\" of women 
and cited the example of Sweden, which had effectively 
targeted the demand factor to fight prostitution and, 
consequently, trafficking, reducing the flow of trafficking 
into the country significantly. 
 
7.  (U) According to Leidholdt\'s powerful presentation, 
prostitution and sex trafficking are two sides of the same 
human rights catastrophe, whether one approaches the issue 
locally or globally.  Both, she said, were part of a system 
of gender-based domination that made violence against women 
and girls profitable.  Both preyed on women and girls made 
vulnerable by poverty, discrimination, and violence, 
leaving them traumatized, sick, and impoverished.  Both, 
she continued, rewarded predators sexually and financially, 
strengthening both the demand and criminal operations that 
ensured the supply of victims.  Leidholdt said the 
concerted effort by some NGOs and governments to 
disassociate prostitution from TIP, treating the two 
phenomena as distinct and unrelated, was a deliberate 
political strategy aimed at legitimizing the sex industry 
and protecting its growth and profitability.  This, she 
insisted, would inevitably lead to more trafficking victims 
as demand outstripped the supply of local women already 
\"working\" in the industry. 
 
8.(U) Hughes agreed that the demand for prostitution 
accounted for the profitability of sex trafficking.  She 
argued that the link between prostitution and sex 
trafficking was indisputable and would not be altered if 
prostitution were legalized.  She bolstered Leidholdt\'s 
 
 
case by citing examples from Europe and Oceania in which 
demand for prostitution -- and subsequently sex trafficking 
to meet this demand -- increased after the 
decriminalization of prostitution.  In response to theories 
that decriminalization of prostitution would help women by 
bringing them out of a shadowy world into the \"care\" of 
protective legislation, Hughes contended that such 
legalization in fact prompted very few women to sign up for 
benefits or unions.  Women and children in this \"industry,\" 
she said, were inevitably controlled by mafias and 
criminals, and could not register with an authority or join 
a union.  With most women forced into this \"work\" due to 
debt, unemployment, or poverty, they have entered a 
coercive and abusive world completely incompatible with the 
fantasy of some benevolent unionization of prostitutes. 
The world of prostitution, Hughes concluded, was instead 
much more compatible with the tactics and realities of 
trafficking and sexual slavery. 
 
----------------------------- 
Media: Voice of the Voiceless 
----------------------------- 
 
9.(U) Following the presentation of recently-broadcast 
excerpts on TIP from three television programs (NBC NEWS 
Dateline, CNN Presents, and CBS NEWS/Miami), Italian 
Ambassador Giuseppe Balboni Acqua took the floor and 
introduced CBS Chief Investigative Reporter Michele Gillen 
and National Public Radio\'s Senior European Correspondent 
Sylvia Poggioli.  Gillen and Poggioli offered first-hand 
experiences of ways in which the media was currently 
addressing TIP, and insights into how the media could be 
further developed as a strategic weapon in this fight. 
Both stressed the need to present programming that avoided 
salaciousness, and noted the importance of utilizing 
reporting techniques that ensured victims featured in such 
programming were not victimized in a different way a second 
time by sharing their stories. 
 
10. (U) Gillen and Poggioli said that media in source 
countries were often afraid to report on trafficking 
because of threats from organized crime or corrupt 
authorities profiting from it.  Western media (most often 
in destination countries) thus had an obligation, they 
said, to increase the exposure of TIP stories.  One 
attendee suggested that more programming be developed by 
the West for source countries that could warn potential 
victims by showing the reality of the \"jobs\" that awaited 
unsuspecting women and others.  This could help counteract 
the \"brainwashing\" of advertisements, programming and news 
stories that depicted a West in which it was easy to find 
fortune.  Poggioli said that one victim had cited to her an 
Italian advertisement that showed a cat eating from an 
expensive silver bowl.  With that type of presentation 
broadcast to Albania and elsewhere in Europe, potential 
victims had come to believe that an easy life awaited them 
in the West. 
 
-------------- 
Film Hits Hard 
-------------- 
 
11.(U) Some 50 conference delegates used a \"brown-bag\" 
lunch break to view the G/TIP-recommended feature film 
\"Lilya 4-Ever.\"  The hard-hitting film had particular 
impact on the members of women\'s religious orders who were 
the majority of viewers.  While time constraints prevented 
a formal session to analyze the movie, informal discussion 
between the shell-shocked viewers coming out of the film 
and other participants ensured that \"Lilya 4-Ever\" would 
get further attention. 
 
------------------------ 
Extensive Media Coverage 
------------------------ 
 
12.(U) Media coverage of the conference included print 
reports in U.S.-based Catholic and non-Catholic media, 
radio interviews with U.S. and Italian speakers, and 
television programming on Vatican-related and U.S. 
television networks.  The media session found particular 
resonance with representatives from this sector, many of 
whom indicated in the discussion session that they were 
thinking of ways to expand their reporting on TIP and anti- 
 
 
TIP efforts.  All speakers\' presentations during the 
conference will be made available on the Embassy Vatican 
website and in EUR/WE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Comment: Momentum will Increase \"Multiplier Effect\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
13.(U) Since Embassy Vatican\'s first conference on 
trafficking in May 2002, the issue has become a much higher 
priority for the Holy See and its related agencies.  The 
participation of Deputy Foreign Minister Parolin, the 
presence of Cardinal Martino who heads the Vatican Council 
of Justice and Peace, and enthusiastic interest of senior 
representatives from a number of women\'s religious orders 
augurs well for future collaboration between faith-based 
communities, the U.S. Government and the Vatican.  We were 
told during the conference that there are a million nuns 
around the world, all committed to the world\'s weakest and 
marginalized; in short, a powerful resource for the 
partnership between governments and faith-based communities 
to combat trafficking. 
 
14. (U) We look to use the substantial momentum from this 
well-attended conference to continue expanding the Holy 
See\'s involvement in anti-TIP work at various levels.  With 
the Vatican diplomatic corps becoming more engaged, and the 
vast network of Catholic religious orders, Bishops 
Conferences and Papal Nuncios becoming more aware of the 
problem, the \"multiplier effect\" of the Embassy\'s 
engagement has been substantial.  Already we have received 
many positive responses and inquiries from Papal Nuncios 
(Holy See ambassadors) and Embassies worldwide to the 
initiatives noted in ref (b).  Post thanks ECA its support 
for this conference and G/TIP for its considerable help in 
all of these endeavors.  End comment.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.(SBU) POPE JOHN PAUL II USED A HIGH PROFILE, 
    INTERNATIONALLY TELEVISED VATICAN CELEBRATION WITH THE 
ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE BARTHOLOMEW I TO 
MAKE NEW EFFORTS FOR UNITY WITH ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS. 
BARTHOLOMEW I, THE \"FIRST AMONG EQUALS\" AMONG ORTHODOX 
PATRIARCHS, JOINED THE POPE IN SYMBOLIC AND CONCRETE ACTS 
THAT AUGER WELL FOR CONTINUED RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE 
TWO CHURCHES.  THOUGH OUR VATICAN CONTACTS TOLD US THEY 
VIEW BARTHOLOMEW\'S INFLUENCE UPON PATRIARCHS LESS EAGER FOR 
RECONCILIATION SUCH AS RUSSIA\'S ALEXY II TO BE UNCERTAIN, 
THEY WELCOMED HIS GESTURES AT RECONCILIATION.  IN PERHAPS 
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT OF THE VISIT, THE TWO 
CHURCHES AGREED TO RESTART A THEOLOGICAL COMMISSION THAT 
HAD BEEN HALTED FOUR YEARS AGO.  WITH THIS AND OTHER 
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE RELATIONSHIP, BARTHOLOMEW\'S VISIT 
SIGNIFIED A STEP TOWARDS UNITY, EVEN IF FORMIDABLE 
OBSTACLES REMAIN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
PATRIARCH JOINS HIGH PROFILE CEREMONY 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.(U) IN A CEREMONY FRAUGHT WITH SYMBOLISM, POPE JOHN 
PAUL II AND ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE 
BARTHOLOMEW I SAT TOGETHER, SHARED A SERMON AND PROFESSED 
THEIR COMMON FAITH BEFORE A CONGREGATION OF SOME 15,000 
GATHERED IN VATICAN CITY FOR ROME\'S PATRONAL FEAST OF 
SAINTS PETER AND PAUL.  BARTHOLOMEW ATTENDED THE MASS TO 
COMMEMORATE THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HISTORIC 
ENCOUNTER BETWEEN POPE PAUL VI (1963-78) AND THEN 
ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH ATHENAGORUS THAT INITIATED A PROCESS 
OF RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO CHURCHES THAT FOR SOME TEN 
    CENTURIES HAD BEEN BITTER RIVALS. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
VISIT COMES AMIDST DISPUTES 
--------------------------- 
 
3.(U) BARTHOLOMEW\'S VISIT WAS A WELCOME SHOT IN THE ARM 
FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO CHURCHES.  CURRENT DIALOGUE 
IS BOGGED DOWN IN DISPUTES BETWEEN CATHOLIC AND ORTHODOX 
CHURCHES IN RUSSIA, ROMANIA AND OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN 
STATES (REFTEL).  CHARGES OF CATHOLIC PROSELYTISM FROM THE 
ORTHODOX, ESPECIALLY RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH ALEXY II, 
HAVE ALSO KEPT THE TWO SIDES AT ARM\'S LENGTH.  THE GREATEST 
MANIFESTATION OF THESE DIFFICULTIES IS PERHAPS THE 
UKRAINIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S BID TO HAVE THE VATICAN NAME IT 
A PATRIARCHATE -- SOMETHING BITTERLY OPPOSED BY THE 
ORTHODOX.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, OFFICIAL THEOLOGICAL DIALOGUE 
AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE SINCE 2000. 
PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW SAID DURING HIS VISIT THAT NON- 
THEOLOGICAL OBSTACLES TO UNITY SHOULD BE RESOLVED 
IMMEDIATELY SO THAT BOTH CHURCHES CAN FOCUS ON THEOLOGICAL 
PROBLEMS.  THE POPE CLEARLY AGREES. 
 
--------------------------- 
\"SOMEONE WE CAN TALK TO...\" 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) JOZEF MAJ, A POLISH JESUIT WHO IS POINT MAN FOR 
ORTHODOX RELATIONS IN THE HOLY SEE\'S PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR 
PROMOTING CHRISTIAN UNITY, TOLD US THE VATICAN WAS VERY 
    PLEASED WITH THE VISIT.  BARTHOLOMEW IS \"SOMEONE WE CAN 
TALK TO,\" HE SAID.  THE PATRIARCH STUDIED FOR SOME YEARS IN 
ROME, AND UNDERSTANDS THE LANGUAGE, MAJ SAID.  MAJ MEANT 
NOT SIMPLY BARTHOLOMEW\'S ITALIAN, THOUGH THE PATRIARCH 
IMPRESSED THE CONGREGATION AT ST. PETER\'S WITH HIS SMOOTH 
PRONUNCIATION, BUT ALSO THE LANGUAGE OF THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH.  BARTHOLOMEW MAY NOT AGREE WITH US ON ALL THE 
DISPUTED MATTERS, MAJ SAID, BUT HE \"KNOWS WHERE WE\'RE 
COMING FROM.\"  THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH SOME OTHER 
ORTHODOX LEADERS, HE SAID.  THE BACKGROUND AND PERSPECTIVE 
OF HARDER-LINE PRELATES FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS LEADS THEM 
TO REGARD THE ROMAN CHURCH AS MUCH MORE FOREIGN THAN DOES 
BARTHOLOMEW.  THE FIRST STEP IN DIALOGUE IS TO KNOW AND 
UNDERSTAND YOUR INTERLOCUTOR, MAJ SAID.  ACCORDING TO THE 
VATICAN, BARTHOLOMEW GETS IT. 
 
----------------------- 
BARTHOLOMEW\'S INFLUENCE 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) MAJ EMPHASIZED BARTHOLOMEW\'S IMPORTANCE IN THE 
 
VATICAN 00002671  002 OF 002 
 
 OTHER CHURCHES HAVE 
SPRUNG.  STILL, HE RECOGNIZED THAT HIS INFLUENCE OVER OTHER 
PATRIARCHS LIKE ALEXY WAS NOT GREAT, SINCE THE NATIONAL 
ORTHODOX CHURCHES RELISH THEIR INDEPENDENCE.  FURTHER, SOME 
SENSITIVE ISSUES SUCH AS THE STATUS OF THE UKRAINIAN 
CATHOLIC CHURCH AND CHARGES OF ROME\'S POACHING ON ORTHODOX 
TURF HIT HOME EVEN HARDER WITH THE RUSSIANS THAN THEY DO 
WITH BARTHOLOMEW.  ON THE OTHER HAND, MAJ CONCLUDED, 
    SOMEONE HAS TO LEAD, AND THE SYMBOLS AND CONCRETE STEPS 
TAKEN DURING THE VISIT LED HIM TO BE OPTIMISTIC. 
 
-------------- 
POSITIVE STEPS 
-------------- 
 
6.(SBU) ONE OF THESE CONCRETE STEPS IS THE RE- 
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR 
THEOLOGICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO CHURCHES.  THESE TALKS 
WERE FIRST UNDERTAKEN IN 1979, BUT WERE DISCONTINUED WHEN 
MEETINGS IN BALTIMORE IN 2000 ENDED IN DISPUTE OVER THE 
STATUS OF THE EASTERN-RITE CATHOLIC CHURCHES (SUCH AS THE 
UKRAINIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH) AND ON THE ROLE OF THE PAPACY. 
MAJ TOLD US THE RE-ESTABLISHED TALKS WOULD INCLUDE MEMBERS 
OF ALL ORTHODOX CHURCHES.  ALEXY\'S ALLEGED INTRANSIGENCE 
NOTWITHSTANDING, MAJ SAID THAT RUSSIAN ORTHODOX 
REPRESENTATIVES HAD BEEN AMONG THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE 
PARTICIPANTS IN PAST COMMISSIONS. 
 
------------------------- 
A CHURCH FOR THE ORTHODOX 
------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) AS A FURTHER SYMBOL OF THE RENEWED COMMITMENT TO 
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO CHURCHES, POPE JOHN PAUL II 
ALSO MADE A GIFT OF A ROMAN CHURCH TO THE LOCAL GREEK 
ORTHODOX COMMUNITY.  [NOTE: A SIMILAR GIFT TO THE RUSSIAN 
ORTHODOX COMMUNITY SEVERAL YEARS AGO WAS REFUSED BY THE 
RUSSIANS.  END NOTE.]  ACCORDING TO MAJ, THIS WAS NO SMALL 
GESTURE IN AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH POSSESSION OF CHURCHES 
    AND RELATIVE TERRITORY IS HOTLY CONTESTED.  THE POPE\'S 
GENEROSITY WAS ALSO A SIGN TO THE ORTHODOX THAT THE 
PRESENCE OF THEIR COMMUNITY IN CATHOLIC ROME IS NOT A 
THREAT, BUT RATHER AN EXPRESSION OF THE RICH DIVERSITY OF 
THE CHRISTIAN TRADITION -- A POSITION CATHOLICS WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE RECIPROCATED IN ORTHODOX TERRITORY. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
ANTI-TERRORISM AND DIALOGUE WITH ISLAM 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U) AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PATRIARCH\'S VISIT, HE AND 
THE POPE ALSO ISSUED A JOINT STATEMENT PROMISING TO 
COOPERATE ON EFFORTS TO TACKLE TERRORISM, RELIGIOUS 
INTOLERANCE, AND \"ATTACKS AGAINST HUMAN LIFE.\"  FOCUSING 
SPECIFICALLY ON EUROPE, THE TWO SPIRITUAL LEADERS SAID 
THEIR CHURCHES SHOULD COMBINE THEIR EFFORTS TO CONSTRUCT A 
REAL DIALOGUE WITH ISLAM, AIMING TO COMBAT MISTRUST AND 
HATRED BY ELIMINATING \"INDIFFERENCE AND MUTUAL IGNORANCE.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
COMMENT: DREAM FOR A UNITED EUROPE STILL ALIVE 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
9.(SBU) THE HOLY SEE\'S RECEPTION OF BARTHOLOMEW WAS PART 
OF THE VATICAN\'S BROAD EUROPEAN STRATEGY TO CEMENT 
ECCLESIASTICAL ALLIANCES TO MATCH THE POLITICAL CONNECTIONS 
THAT ARE FAST-DEVELOPING IN TODAY\'S EUROPE.  THIS IS 
PARTICULARLY URGENT GIVEN THE FAILURE OF THE HOLY SEE\'S 
INTENSE LOBBYING TO ENSURE A REFERENCE TO THE CONTINENT\'S 
CHRISTIAN HERITAGE IN THE NEW EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION.  EVER 
    SINCE HE ASSUMED THE PAPACY, JOHN PAUL II HAS BEEN DRIVEN 
BY A FERVENT DESIRE FOR A UNITED EUROPE FOUNDED ON 
CHRISTIAN VALUES, STRETCHING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE 
URALS.  IN THE POPE\'S WORDS, HE WANTS TO SEE A EUROPE 
BREATHING WITH TWO LUNGS -- WESTERN AND EASTERN, CATHOLIC 
AND ORTHODOX.  REMAINING OBSTACLES NOTWITHSTANDING, 
BARTHOLOMEW\'S VISIT KEPT A GLIMMER OF HOPE ALIVE FOR THE 
REALIZATION OF THAT VISION.  END COMMENT.

1.(U) The Holy See ended 2003 with a budget deficit for 
the third year in a row, this year showing a shortfall of 
nearly $12 million.  The budget covers all government 
departments and activities, as well as the Holy See\'s 
embassies and diplomatic offices around the world.  During 
2003, the Vatican took in just over $250 million, but spent 
more than $262 million.  The deficit was 30 percent less 
than the shortfall reported for 2002.  One of the biggest 
drains on the Holy See coffers is Vatican Radio, which does 
not accept advertising revenues and requires some $25 
million to run.  The Holy See has decided to continue 
investing heavily in Vatican Radio\'s worldwide broadcasts 
in any case, judging such outreach as particularly valuable 
in developing nations with limited communications networks. 
 
2.(U) Vatican City State has a separate budget within 
the Holy See\'s accounting system.  It lost some $11 million 
in 2003.  This budget includes the care and upkeep of 
Vatican buildings, as well as the Vatican\'s coin and stamp 
offices and the Vatican Museums.  The Vatican City State 
budget was negative in part due to new projects and 
reconstruction, but primarily because nearly $13 million 
was siphoned off earnings to cover half the deficit of 
Vatican Radio. 
 
3.(U) The good news for the Vatican in the budget 
statement was that during 2003 donations from Catholics 
around the world to Peter\'s Pence (a fund used by popes for 
charity, but also at times to offset the deficit) amounted 
to some $56 million.  This was an increase of 6 percent 
over 2002.  Speculation that the abuse crisis in the U.S. 
Church would result in decreased American financial support 
for the Holy See in the end proved to be groundless.  U.S. 
. 
Catholics continue to be the top donors worldwide. 
 
4.(SBU) Comment.  The 2003 budget figures help to dispel 
the myth that the Vatican possesses extraordinary financial 
wealth.  The Holy See views its priceless works of art and 
other treasures as part of humanity\'s patrimony; as 
guardian of these treasures, it would be loath to liquidate 
them to offset expenses.  End comment.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Vatican Country Director for Nicaragua Lucio Sembrano 
said July 8 that he did not regard current Church-State 
tensions (reftels) as a result of any government campaign 
against the Church.  While not entirely excusing government 
offenses against Catholic hierarchy, Sembrano (protect 
throughout) acknowledged that actions by Cardinal Obando and 
others had increased tensions with the government.  He said 
President Bolanos was \"doing his best\" in a difficult 
situation.  Though Sembrano sees little chance of influencing 
Obando and like-minded prelates on this issue, he said that 
the Holy See would not be disappointed when the Cardinal is 
out of the spotlight.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
No Government Campaign against the Church 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Vatican Country Director for Nicaragua Lucio Sembrano 
(protect throughout) told us July 8 that the Holy See did not 
regard current Church-State tensions in Nicaragua (reftels) 
as a result of any campaign against the Church by the GON. 
While not entirely excusing government offenses against the 
Church, Sembrano said the Bolanos government had been \"very 
patient\" in handling the \"noisy\" opposition coming from 
certain parties within the church, specifically Cardinal 
Miguel Obando y Bravo.  Bolanos \"is doing his best\" in a 
difficult situation, Sembrano said. 
 
----------------------------- 
Hierarchy not Helping Matters 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Sembrano made it clear he thought Cardinal Obando was 
not helping matters.  Though he did not seem aware that 
Obando had agreed to celebrate the July 19 anniversary Mass 
(ref b), Sembrano suggested that Obando \"naively\" believed 
that Daniel Ortega had \"reformed himself.\"  Obando \"doesn\'t 
realize the ramifications of some of his actions,\" Sembrano 
concluded. 
 
---------------- 
Vatican Pressure 
---------------- 
 
4.  (C) Sembrano led us to believe that Vatican pressure on 
Obando and other churchmen to temper provocative actions in 
relation to the government was ineffective.  On the other 
hand, Sembrano told us, the Vatican would not be disappointed 
when Obando, who is already beyond the standard episcopal 
retirement age of 75, left the spotlight.  Though Sembrano 
did not name any leading candidates waiting in the wings to 
replace Obando, he noted that Catholic Prelature Opus Dei 
might be in a position to influence the eventual choice, as 
it is strong in Nicaragua. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Papal Nuncio Active, but Unheeded 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) As far as other Vatican opportunities to influence 
the situation, Sembrano said that current Papal Nuncio 
Jean-Paul Gobel was \"active,\" but predicted that he would 
inevitably find himself on the wrong side of the Nicaraguan 
bishops -- if he wasn\'t already there.  Most attempts to 
influence the bishops tended to alienate them, he said, as 
they were strong willed and resented interference, even from 
Rome.  He said the previous nuncio had experienced the same 
problems. 
 
-------------- 
1861 Concordat 
 
-------------- 
 
6.  (C) When asked about the GON\'s renewed interest in the 
1861 Concordat (ref b), Sembrano noted that government 
officials had approached Gobel and asked for a copy of the 
document.  They also asked for a list of all the previous 
nuncios who had served in Managua, as apparently the archives 
containing this information had been destroyed.  Sembrano 
said the Holy See was not concerned about the Concordat 
affair; there was talk of updating the document, but the 
Vatican would of course do nothing without consulting the 
Bishops\' Conference. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (C) Sembrano, who always speaks frankly with us, 
displayed a sympathy for the Nicaraguan government that was 
striking given current tensions.  This, however, does not 
mean the Vatican can or will influence the situation.  The 
Holy See is typically less willing to meddle in political 
issues than it is in theological matters.  Even when it does 
wade into politics, its leverage on bishops is weaker when it 
comes to political affairs than it is with issues of \"faith 
and morals.\" 
 
8.  (C) Further, though Sembrano implied that the Vatican 
would be content to see the 78-year-old Obando retire, in 
fact, the matter lies entirely in the Pope\'s hands.  A bishop 
must offer his resignation to the Pope when he turns 75. 
Though the Pope asks some prelates to continue to serve 
beyond age 75, he can at any later date move to accept their 
resignation.  Having initially declined Obando\'s resignation 
three years ago, the Vatican may now be simply waiting for a 
lull in the political action to ease him discretely into 
retirement.  However, the Holy See could be so hesitant to 
risk action in this environment that it will now allow Obando 
effectively to decide on his own when he wants to hang up his 
mitre.

2. (SBU)  Holy See Country Director for Sudan Lucio 
Sembrano said July 8 that the visits of Secretary Powell 
and Secretary-General Annan to Darfur had spurred the Pope 
to dispatch his aid chief to the region.  Archbishop Paul 
Cordes, President of the Vatican\'s aid coordination agency, 
Cor Unum, is currently deciding on a date to travel to 
Darfur to assess the situation on the ground.  Though 
Cordes\' role is to coordinate Catholic aid in the region, 
Cor Unum sources told us he will bring with him a small 
gift of cash assistance from the Pope as well.  Cor Unum 
has been working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) on the crisis for some time (ref. b). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
VATICAN SUPPORTIVE; NO PLANS NOW FOR POPE TO SPEAK 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3.  (SBU) Sembrano took on reftel points with interest and 
praised U.S. leadership on Sudan.  He said that with 
international attention to Darfur already high, there were 
no current plans for the Pope to speak publicly on it.  He 
did note that soft-spoken Papal Nuncio (Ambassador) to 
Sudan Archbishop Dominique Mamberti was continuing to work 
\"behind the scenes\" on various aspects of the crisis. 
Though heartened by the increased attention to Darfur, 
Sembrano said it was hard to be optimistic given the 
Khartoum government\'s history of duplicity.  He concluded 
that he hoped that it would be harder for Khartoum to \"play 
games\" with humanitarian aid and militias now that the 
world was watching closely. 
 
----------------- 
NUNCIO CONFERENCE 
----------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The Holy See will focus its attention on Darfur 
and other African issues at a Vatican conference this 
September.  Papal Nuncios to African states will meet at 
the Vatican to discuss regional issues and brief Holy See 
Foreign Ministry officials on concerns at their posts.  The 
last such meeting occurred some five years ago.

Port au Prince.  Giordano was just ordained an archbishop and

1.   A June 30 Trafficking in Persons Digital Video 
Conference (DVC) linked key Holy See contacts and media 
with G/TIP\'s Ambassador John Miller.  In conjunction with 
Embassy Rome, Embassy Vatican brought together three key 
elements in the fight against human trafficking: Vatican 
officials and religious personnel, faith-based 
organizations and NGOs, and media interested in raising 
awareness of this modern-day slavery.  Participants left 
the event better informed about the Department\'s anti-TIP 
initiatives and enthused about further efforts against 
trafficking.  Post will continue to use DVC technology to 
connect the Department with Vatican-affiliated 
organizations worldwide.  End Summary.

2.A June 30 Digital Video Conference (DVC) dedicated to 
Trafficking in Persons (TIP) linked key Holy See contacts 
and media with G/TIP\'s Ambassador John Miller.  In 
conjunction with Embassy Rome, Embassy Vatican brought 
together three key elements in the fight against human 
trafficking: Vatican officials and religious personnel 
involved with the Catholic Church\'s efforts to address TIP, 
faith-based organizations and NGOs as first responders for 
victims, and media as a strategic resource for raising 
awareness of TIP. 
 
---------------------------- 
Influential Officials Attend 
---------------------------- 
 
3.Participants included Holy See officials from the 
Secretariat of State and from the Council for Migrants and 
 
SIPDIS 
d 
Itinerant Peoples.  In addition, top officials from the 
Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and Holy Cross Fathers attended 
the session and expressed interest in becoming more 
involved in fighting TIP.  Both male religious orders have 
a significant presence on the ground in both origin and 
destination countries.  They should be instrumental in the 
expansion of Post\'s highly successful anti-trafficking 
training program implemented by the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) with funding from PRM (ref 
a).  An element of the program\'s expansion entails training 
personnel from male religious orders to confront the demand 
side of trafficking and generally raise awareness. 
 
------------------ 
Lively Interaction 
------------------ 
 
4.Ambassador Nicholson began the afternoon with an 
introduction to the issue and to the participants. 
Attendees appreciated Ambassador Miller\'s effort to 
summarize key findings of the 2004 Annual TIP Report, many 
of them Italy specific.  Several representatives made 
presentations and participated actively in the lively 
question and answer session.  The Italian Union of Major 
Superior\'s (USMI) Sister Eugenia Bonetti, a 2004 TIP Report 
\"Trafficking Hero,\" critiqued aspects of current Italian 
laws that do little to discern between illegal immigration 
and human trafficking, and therefore limit assistance for 
those affected by the latter. 
 
------------------------ 
Extensive Media Coverage 
------------------------ 
 
5.Media coverage of the DVC was extensive and included 
reports in U.S.-based Catholic and non-Catholic print 
media.  U.S. television coverage is also expected. 
Coverage in Italy was broad and included FIDES (Vatican- 
affiliated international news agency), ANSA (Italy\'s 
official news agency), AGI (Italy\'s second largest news 
agency), and AP.com (AP-affiliated agency).

6. Post thanks Embassy Rome and G/TIP for their work on the 
DVC and notes the positive feedback from our participants. 
We appreciate Ambassador Miller\'s offer to continue 
dialogue with Vatican-affiliated organizations and plan to 
organize further DVC events to that end.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C)  The Holy See\'s North Korea Country Director told us 
July 9 that Caritas has reinforced its traditional emergency 
food aid programs with training programs for local North 
Korean officials.  The Vatican is cautiously optimistic that 
this focus on relationship building will create a greater 
acceptance of Western aid workers, and a growing openess in 
North Korean society that could eventually lead to a degree 
of religious freedom.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Food Aid Builds Relationships in the Hermit Kingdom 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (C)  Holy See Country Director for North Korea, Monsignor 
Luis Montemayor, reviewed with us July 9 the work in North 
Korea of Catholic relief agency Caritas International-- one 
of the largest NGOs providing humanitarian aid in the DPRK. 
He noted that Caritas provided emergency food aid for 
immediate crises and conducted training programs for North 
Koreans in local governance and cooperation with Western aid 
agencies.  The latter, he said, are deliberately 
under-reported by Caritas for fear that media attention could 
spark a governmental crack-down on Western aid work. 
 
3. (C)  The DPRK clients in these \"confidence-building 
programs\" are primarily officials from \"semi-governmental\" 
North Korean organizations.  According to Montemayor, these 
programs not only facilitate the deployment of Caritas aid, 
but also foster long-term relationships between Western aid 
workers and North Korean officials.  He understood that local 
officials had begun to exhibit greater trust of outsiders 
after increased exposure to Westerners. 
 
4. (C)  Kathi Zellweger, Director for International 
Cooperation for Caritas Hong Kong, told us Caritas has made 
this focus on personal relationships and openness a central 
aspect of its strategy to advance its work in North Korea. 
She noted that Caritas had sponsored \"exposure tours\" for 
North Koreans, such as a recent a trip to China for the new 
Korean Association for Supporting the Disabled.  The North 
Koreans saw first hand the techniques the Chinese use in 
working with the disabled -- and the cooperation between the 
Chinese and Caritas.  Zellweger said that requests for study 
tours and training programs abroad are increasing, and 
Caritas now tries to introduce such exposure programs 
whenever possible. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) The Holy See recognizes that there is currently very 
little space in the political and social framework of the 
DPRK for religious freedom, but believes Caritas can help 
create at least a little room for outside influence in the 
country.  In addition, these programs can supplement Caritas\' 
traditional emergency aid efforts to quietly build long-term 
relationships between North Koreans and outsiders.  Taking 
this long-term view, the Vatican hopes that the seeds Caritas 
sows today in North Korea that will eventually produce a more 
open society with religious freedom for all.

SUBJECT: SUDAN:  SANT\'EGIDIO OFFERS ROME MEDIATION VENUE 
FOR DARFUR PEACE TALKS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador James Nicholson.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY and ACTION REQUEST:  The Rome-based 
Sant\'Egidio Community, which specializes in conflict 
mediation and has ties with both the Sudanese government and 
main rebel groups, conveyed its interest in hosting informal 
discussions at its Rome-based headquarters to establish a 
political dialogue aimed at bringing about a resolution of 
the ongoing conflict in Darfur.  Sant\'Egidio believes Rome 
could offer a neutral venue acceptable to all the parties. 
The Community\'s representatives at recent Addis Ababa talks 
had mentioned this offer informally to U.S. officials, but 
wanted to make a more formal offer to the parties involved if 
such a step would in principle be acceptable to the U.S.  If 
the U.S. would be amenable to Rome as a venue, Sant\'Egidio 
would welcome U.S. support to secure the participation of the 
government and opposition groups.  Sant\'Egidio maintains 
excellent ties with the African Union, and would also work to 
ensure their involvement should discussions eventually take 
place in Rome.  (See Action Request para. 7.)  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Sant\' Egidio Community representative Mario Giro 
contacted DCM July 23 to reiterate the Community\'s interest 
in offering a venue for discussions between the Sudanese 
government and rebel groups aimed at establishing a genuine 
political dialogue and defusing the situation in Darfur. 
Giro noted that he had conveyed this offer informally to U.S. 
officials at the recent African Union-sponsored talks in 
Addis Ababa, but wanted to pursue it further.  Before 
discussing this further with the parties to the conflict, 
Sant\' Egidio wanted to secure U.S. support in principle. 
 
3. (C) Sant\'Egidio has well-developed contacts with both the 
Sudanese government and the major rebel groups in Darfur, 
and, according to Giro, is trusted by all sides.  The SLA\'s 
(Sudanese Liberation Army) leader has been to Rome three 
times in recent months for meetings with Sant\'Egidio, and 
Sant\' Egidio has met with JEM (Justice and Equality Movement) 
leaders in Paris in February.  Giro also met the Sudanese 
President and Vice Foreign Minister during his recent visit 
to the region.  Giro understood that the rebel groups had 
reservations about continuing discussQ 
Q,QzGf}to facilitate their travel), preferring 
Geneva, where they had close links to the Human Dialogue 
Center.  The government, however, would likely be reluctant 
to go to Geneva, which they would see as a venue favoring the 
rebel groups.  For these reasons, Giro believed Sant\'Egidio\'s 
Rome headquarters could offer a neutral venue out of the 
limelight for discussions on Darfur. 
 
4.  (C) Giro observed that if the international community 
agrees on the need for a political dialogue on Darfur, it 
would be necessary to find a better venue than Addis Ababa, 
and a better mediator than the African Union (AU). 
Sant\'Egidio was prepared to offer their headquarters -- the 
site of the successful mediation of the Mozambique civil war 
and other African conflicts -- and their services as mediator 
to both the government and rebels.  Before doing so, however, 
Sant\' Egidio wanted to vet their proposal with the U.S. 
Specifically, Giro asked whether this proposal would be 
acceptable in principle to the U.S. and solicited U.S. views 
on the benefits of a genuine political dialogue.  If the U.S. 
reaction is positive, Sant\' Egidio would look to the U.S. to 
convey to the parties our support for such a dialogue in Rome. 
 
5.  (C) Giro emphasized that Sant\' Egidio, which is 
concluding an arrangement for observer status with the 
African Union, was sensitive to the need to incorporate the 
AU into any dialogue.  Giro said the Community\'s relations 
with the AU were such that they could finesse AU 
participation without offending the organization, and would 
also ensure the AU\'s involvement in a way agreeable to all 
the parties. 
 
6.  (C) As to the content of such talks, Giro suggested that 
the first meetings, which would be confidential, would likely 
aim at establishing an agenda.  Once an agenda was 
established, the meetings could be expanded to include 
observers, including the AU.  Giro noted that he understood 
some were skeptical of a political dialogue, preferring to 
focus simply on a cease-fire and a humanitarian dialogue. 
The risk with this approach, he believed, was that the 
underlying problems could easily resurface again, or could 
have negative influence on the peace talks in Kenya or 
spillover effects on stability in Chad. 
 
7.  (C) ACTION REQUEST:  Embassy requests Department review 
Sant\' Egidio\'s offer to host confidential discussions between 
the Sudanese government and rebel groups and advise Embassy 
of reservations/support for this proposal to convey to Sant\' 
 
 
Egidio\'s senior representatives in Rome.  As noted above, 
Sant\' Egidio has a long and distinguished history of conflict 
mediation, particularly in Africa, where they worked closely 
with the U.S to end the Mozambican civil war, and have 
recently been engaged in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Sudan.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Holy See Country Director for the Middle East Coppola 
elaborated on his foreign minister\'s frustrations with 
Vatican-Israel relations July 22, pointing to stalled 
negotiations on issues related to the 1994 Fundamental 
Agreement between the two governments as the main source of 
contention.  Coppola was pessimistic about the next round of 
talks scheduled for September and warned that Israel\'s stance 
endangered the future of the Christian community in the Holy 
Land.  He also criticized the construction of Israel\'s 
security barrier, suggesting a parallel between what the Holy 
See regards as intransigence on that issue and the problems 
in bilateral relations with the Vatican.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
Frustration Not Surprising 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Holy See Country Director for the Middle East 
Monsignor Franco Coppola expressed frustration with the state 
of Holy See-Israel relations in a July 22 meeting.  Coppola 
expanded on criticisms of the GOI leveled by Holy See Foreign 
Minister Giovanni Lajolo during a July 17 meeting with 
visiting Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) (ref a).  Coppola said 
he was not surprised that Lajolo became animated in his 
description of current ills in Vatican-Israel relations, as 
he has seen what the Vatican considers Israeli insincerity in 
negotiations \"for some time now.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Coppola: Catholics Not Trying to Avoid Fair Share 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3. (C) Coppola agreed with Lajolo that frustrations between 
the Holy See and Israel had reached a new level with the 
controversy surrounding the July 5 negotiating session 
between delegations from the two governments.  A number of 
issues that formed part of the 1994 Fundamental Agreement 
that established full diplomatic relations between the two 
governments remain unresolved, including some related to 
taxation, property, and visas for religious workers (ref b). 
Coppola insisted that Catholic groups in Israel were not 
simply trying to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. 
Rather, the rates Israel is demanding are in many cases much 
higher than similar taxes paid in Europe.  Further, he 
claimed, the government of Israel was demanding funds from 
institutions that had little or no income, such as churches 
that did not charge tourists or others for entry.  As a 
result, some institutions had been withholding tax payment 
for about two years.  The situation was untenable, Coppola 
said, and threatened the future of the Christian community in 
the Holy Land. 
 
--------------- 
September Talks 
--------------- 
 
4. (C) The Israelis now claim to have completed some of the 
technical work on outstanding aspects of the Fundamental 
Agreement and maintain that they are simply awaiting 
government clearance to move forward, Coppola said.  But he 
did not seem convinced that this would translate into 
progress when negotiations resumed in September.  \"You cannot 
predict it,\" Coppola concluded.  \"No one can say what\'s in 
their minds.\" 
 
---------------- 
Security Barrier 
---------------- 
 
5. (C) Coppola implied a connection between Israel\'s 
inflexibility on issues with the Holy See, and what the 
Vatican sees as the GOI\'s obstinate position on the security 
barrier.  \"Of course no one doubts the right of the Israelis 
to defend themselves,\" he said.  \"But they cannot just build 
a wall in disputed territory.\"  According to Coppola, Israel 
can automatically count on U.S. support, and is able to stand 
against the international community partially because of this 
backing.  He emphasized that world opinion had to count for 
something in a case like this.  \"Look at the UN vote (on the 
opinion of the International Court of Justice) --  150 in 
favor and six against,\" he said.  \"It\'s no accident that 
 
opinion is so one-sided on this issue.\"

SUBJECT: POPE CONDEMNS IRAQ CHURCH BOMBINGS; CHALDEAN 
CATHOLICS \"DIDN\'T SEE IT COMING\" 
 
1.  (U)  The Pope reacted strongly to Sunday\'s Iraq church 
bombings in an August 2 message to Emmanuel III, Patriarch of 
Iraq\'s Chaldean Catholic Church.  The Pope said that he 
\"firmly deplored the unjust aggressions against those whose 
only aim is to collaborate for peace and reconciliation in 
the country.\"  He added that he felt close to Iraqi Catholics 
in their hour of suffering, which the statement said was made 
even more grave because the attacks took place while the 
faithful were gathered for prayer.  The Pope expressed his 
hope that \"all believers in one merciful God (would) unite in 
deploring every form of violence.\" 
 
2.  (SBU)  Monsignor Philip Najim, representative of the 
Chaldean Church to the Holy See, told us August 2 that the 
Chaldeans \"didn\'t see (Sunday\'s violence) coming.\"  Though 
Najim and others had warned recently of increased animosity 
towards Christians on the part of Muslims (septel), Najim 
said few thought it would erupt into the wholesale attacks 
seen Sunday.  \"These are definitely not Iraqis,\" Najim 
insisted.  \"We have never had these problems in Iraq before. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Najim said that one of the targets was the 
Patriarchal Seminary located next to a Chaldean parish.  The 
parish was hosting a prayer service in preparation for the 
Catholic Feast of the Assumption August 15, so the victim 
toll was high.  Najim said he had spoken to some monks 
attached to the seminary, who said they thought the death 
toll would be higher than media estimates.  Najim had not yet 
been able to reach the Patriarch by phone, and was about to 
visit the Vatican to consult with officials there. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Chaldean Catholics form the majority of Iraq\'s 
Christian population, some 750,000 people or 3 percent of the 
population.  Well over 65,000 Chaldean Catholics live in the 
U.S., organized through a diocese headquartered in Detroit. 
Najim noted that the Chaldean Church, which suffered 
massacres of some 70,000 during World War I, was called \"The 
Church of the Martyrs.\"  He was shaken after the bombings, 
and worried that the attacks would spur a further exodus of 
Christians from Iraq.

1.Embassy Vatican\'s July 27 Digital Video Conference 
(DVC) on HIV/AIDS linked key interlocutors from the Holy 
See and faith-based organizations with U.S. Global AIDS 
Coordinator Randall Tobias.  Following the increased focus 
on the potential contributions of faith-based groups at the 
Bangkok AIDS Conference, the DVC provided an opportunity 
for Ambassador Tobias to review implementation of the 
President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and to discuss 
areas for expanded cooperation with the Holy See and faith- 
based groups active in HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. 
Tobias also appealed to his interlocutors to help encourage 
generic drug producers to submit drugs for approval under 
the new expedited approval process to ensure the U.S. is 
able to purchase the most cost-effective drugs under the 
President\'s plan.  Vatican-based media covered the event 
extensively, resulting in positive treatment of USG efforts 
to combat HIV/AIDS.  End Summary.

Vatican Agencies, Faith-Based Orgs Convene 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.Embassy Vatican organized a Digital Video Conference 
(DVC) July 27 on HIV/AIDS, linking key HIV/AIDS 
interlocutors from the Holy See and faith-based 
organizations with U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator Randall 
Tobias.  Vatican agencies represented included the Council 
for Health Issues, the Holy See\'s Foreign Ministry, the 
Council for Justice and Peace, Caritas Internationalis, and 
the Vatican\'s primary think tank for ethics.  The Vatican- 
affiliated Sant\'Egidio Community, which has active and 
growing HIV/AIDS treatment programs in Mozambique and other 
African countries was also represented.  On the heels of 
the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, where 
faith-based organizations were hailed as an untapped 
resource in the fight against HIV/AIDS, participants 
exchanged ideas on further collaboration between their 
organizations and the USG. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Critical Role for Faith Based Communities 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.Ambassador Tobias updated participants on the 
President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global 
Fund.  He emphasized that cooperation with faith-based 
agencies was critical to the fight against the AIDS 
pandemic.  Participants described to Tobias their concerns 
over access to USG funding, especially for small community- 
based projects in the poorest countries.  Council for 
Health Issues President Cardinal Lozano Barragan expressed 
concern over allocation of funding, noting the importance 
of prioritizing funds for those in the most dire straits. 
All participants recognized the importance of HIV/AIDS 
prevention programs, but discussion focused on how best to 
get cost-effective antiretroviral treatment to people in 
the world\'s poorest countries. 
 
4.  Cardinal Barragan, who has had previous contacts with 
HS and S/GAC staff, announced during the DVC the formation 
of a \"Good Samaritan\" foundation attached to his Council 
that would be set up to facilitate requests for HIV/AIDS 
funding from Catholic hospitals and health care providers 
worldwide.  Noting that often these institutions or groups 
were too small to wade through the international assistance 
bureaucracies, Barragan said the foundation would act as a 
clearinghouse that could allow smaller groups to take 
advantage of available funding sources.  Directors of the 
Sant\'Egidio Community\'s antiretroviral treatment program in 
sub-Saharan Africa (ref a) shared insights into their work 
and its successes, emphasizing the importance of developing 
new paradigms for health care that reflect the reality of 
poor health infrastructures in many countries. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Links to Development and Infrastructure 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5.Other participants stressed the need for expanded 
development assistance to address poverty, and the need to 
expand and improve the health care infrastructure in the 
poorest countries.  Caritas Internationalis Secretary 
General Duncan MacLaren said the fight against HIV/AIDS 
could not be separated from the fight against poverty.  He 
 
noted that poor nutrition and other ills associated with 
poverty combined with AIDS to create more serious 
humanitarian disasters.  S/GAC Tobias commented that the 
U.S. understands these connections and was also addressing 
broader issues of poverty and health infrastructures; at 
the same time he stressed that the U.S. recognized that the 
program had to be sharply focused on HIV/AIDS or it would 
become to broad to have an impact. 
 
-------------------------- 
Questions on Generic Drugs 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  Vatican participants also expressed concern about USG 
policies on FDA approval for drugs used in overseas 
programs.  Ambassador Tobias corrected misunderstandings of 
U.S. policy, emphasizing that the USG wanted to ensure that 
people with HIV/AIDS received safe, effective drugs. 
Observing that it would be wrong for the U.S. to give 
people in poor countries medicine it would not give to 
Americans, he nevertheless made clear that the U.S. was 
ready to review and expedite approval of any generic drug 
that met the standards to ensure availability of the lowest 
cost drugs. 
 
----------------------- 
Positive Media Coverage 
----------------------- 
 
6.Participation of Vatican media in the DVC resulted in 
positive coverage of U.S. efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, 
countering the sometimes negative reporting that had come 
out of Bangkok.  Coverage of the event was wide-ranging, 
including pieces in Vatican-related web bulletins, the 
widely-read \"Word From Rome\" column in the National 
Catholic Reporter, a Vatican radio interview featuring 
several participants, and reports by the main Italian news 
agency, ANSA.  Journalists and others also had an 
opportunity to discuss the media\'s role in the fight 
against the AIDS pandemic. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.Post greatly appreciates Ambassador Tobias\'s 
willingness to participate in this DVC, which served to 
deepen our ongoing dialogue and advance consideration 
within the Holy See about how best to make use of its 
extensive Catholic health networks worldwide to combat 
HIV/AIDS.  As Ambassador Nicholson told the media, the 
event allowed Tobias and Vatican representatives to \"get 
acquainted\" and continue momentum for faith-based 
organizations and the U.S. government in the fight against 
HIV/AIDS.  End comment.

Summary

1.  (C) Acting Holy See Foreign Minister Parolin reaffirmed 
August 18 that the Holy See remained open to Turkish EU 
membership, notwithstanding recent critical comments by 
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.  Parolin emphasized that the Holy 
See\'s position on Turkish membership in the EU had not 
changed from the stance it has described to us in the past 
(ref a).  If Turkey meets the EU\'s Copenhagen criteria, 
Parolin said, the Vatican sees \"no obstacle\" to EU 
membership.  He clarified that Ratzinger\'s skeptical view of 
EU membership for Turkey reflected the Cardinal\'s \"personal 
feeling,\" and did not reflect the view of the Holy See. 
Parolin acknowledged that some within the Holy See harbored 
concerns about Turkey\'s EU bid and its potential impact on 
the EU, but maintained that he believed these concerns could 
be addressed over time, and would not represent 
insurmountable obstacles.  He acknowledged that Ratzinger\'s 
statement was incorrectly seen as a Vatican position, and 
indicated a willingness to consider clarifying its formal 
position pending discussions with the Turkish Ambassador -- 
who had yet to raise the issue --  and with FM Lajolo on his 
return to Rome later this month.  End Summary.

Holy See Still Open to Turkish EU Membership 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Acting Vatican Foreign Minister equivalent Monsignor 
Pietro Parolin told Charge August 18 that the Holy See 
remained open to Turkish EU membership.  He affirmed that 
recent negative comments about Turkey\'s EU bid by Cardinal 
Joseph Ratzinger did not reflect any change in the Holy See\'s 
formal position.  That position remained that, if Turkey 
fully meets the EU\'s Copenhagen criteria, the Vatican sees 
\"no obstacle\" to EU membership.  Parolin made it clear that 
Ratzinger\'s take on the issue was his own, and that he was 
not speaking on behalf of the Holy See.  \"These were his 
personal feelings,\" Parolin added.  \"Although he is an 
important member of the Curia, he does not speak for the 
Secretariat of State.\"

Turkey\'s EU Bid: Complexities, but no Great Obstacles 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3.  (C) While Parolin discounted Ratzinger\'s comments -- that 
Turkey had always been \"in permanent contrast to Europe\" and 
that linking it to Europe would be a mistake -- as not 
reflective of Vatican foreign policy, he did allow that EU 
membership for Turkey would present challenges.  He noted the 
difficulty of European integration for a country with such a 
different cultural and religious background, citing existent 
problems with the integration of Muslims into European 
society as reason for caution when examining Turkey\'s EU 
hopes.  He acknowledged that there were others, including 
former FM Cardinal Tauran, who share Ratzinger\'s concerns. 
Tauran had suggested the EU look first to Orthodox Christian 
countries Ukraine and Moldova before addressing Turkey\'s 
membership.   Parolin affirmed that the Holy See\'s primary 
concern with Turkey\'s EU bid remained religious freedom, 
particularly the juridical status of churches in Turkey (ref 
a).  In his view, the \"difficulties and complexities\" did not 
represent an insurmountable obstacle for Turkey\'s EU 
membership, but rather necessary topics of reflection that 
would have to be addressed before moving forward on accession. 
 
---------------------------------- 
At Odds with Papal Muslim Outreach 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Charge pointed out that as an EU member, Turkey could 
help to ease tensions between the Western and Muslim worlds, 
illustrating how a secular state with a Muslim population 
could cooperate with countries with a Judeo-Christian 
heritage.  He noted that the Pope, in his outreach to the 
Muslim world, has constantly preached the doctrine of 
inclusion and integration, even while advocating recognition 
of Europe\'s Christian roots.  Ratzinger\'s comments, by 
contrast, suggested a permanent state of conflict and 
division that appeared to run counter to the Pope\'s broader 
 
outreach to the Muslim world, the Charge observed.  Parolin 
acknowledged this contradiction, and indicated that he 
believed it was possible that Turkish EU membership could 
eventually help the Christian minority and others suffering 
from a lack of religious freedom in Turkey.  \"We certainly 
hope for that development,\" he concluded.  Charge also 
pointed out that Turkey has for decades been an important 
member of NATO that had contributed significantly to the 
organization\'s success; there was no reason why it could not 
contribute equally to the EU. 
 
---------------------- 
Clarification Possible 
---------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Charge noted the public confusion generated when a 
senior Vatican official as influential as Cardinal Ratzinger 
makes a political statement on such a sensitive issue, and 
emphasized the importance of clarifying its official 
position.  In this regard, Charge passed Parolin an account 
of Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan\'s sharply critical 
response to Ratzinger\'s comments, including the strong 
reaction by the Turkish and American media.  Parolin had not 
yet seen Erdogan\'s comments, and appeared concerned by their 
bluntness.  He also indicated his surprise that the Turkish 
Ambassador had not yet contacted him, though he said it was 
possible the Ambassador was on summer leave.  Parolin 
indicated that he would wait to hear the Turkish reaction, 
and would then discuss with FM Lajolo the possibility of 
issuing some form of clarification of the Vatican\'s stance. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) As we saw most notably during the Iraq war when 
individual Cardinals offered personal criticism of USG policy 
(refs b, c), the media often characterizes the personal views 
of high-ranking prelates as \"Vatican\" stances.  In this case, 
Ratzinger\'s lofty stature in matters of Catholic theology 
made the temptation to do so even greater.  In fact, 
Ratzinger\'s influence in matters of faith and morals does not 
translate into direct influence upon Vatican foreign policy, 
where his expertise is much more limited.  Ratzinger has been 
a leading voice behind the Holy See\'s unsuccessful drive to 
secure a reference to Europe\'s \"Christian roots\" in the EU 
constitution, and he clearly understands that allowing a 
Muslim country into the EU would further weaken his case for 
Europe\'s Christian foundations.  In any case, the Vatican\'s 
official position remains one of cautious, skeptical openness 
towards Turkish integration to the EU.  In fact, the Pope, in 
his February address to Turkish Ambassador Durak essentially 
acknowledged Turkey\'s future in Europe, telling Durak that 
\"as Turkey prepares to establish new relations with Europe,\" 
the Church would insist on \"fundamental human rights\" for 
Turkish Catholics.

SUBJECT: HOLY SEE CLARIFIES POSITION ON NAJAF MEDIATION 
 
REF: LEVIN-HARDT 8/17 E-MAIL 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'affaires, D. Brent Hardt.  Reasons:  1.5 (b) an 
d (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: The Holy See\'s Acting Foreign Minister 
Pietro Parolin told Charge August 18 that the Holy See would 
be willing to help mediate the standoff in Najaf if all 
parties to the conflict requested it, but had indicated this 
willingness only in response to a public request made by an 
al-Sadr \"spokesman.\"  Charge outlined the U.S. view (reftel) 
that al-Sadr\'s proposal was merely a delaying tactic, and did 
not reflect a good faith desire to resolve the impasse. 
Charge also emphasized that resolution of the conflict was 
the responsibility of the Interim Iraqi Government (IIG), 
which was best placed to determine the way forward.  Parolin 
noted that the Holy See had come under intense pressure from 
the media late August 15 to respond to the al-Sadr \"proposal\" 
and had issued their standard statement of Holy See 
willingness to provide good offices when all parties to a 
conflict request such support. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) During an August 18 call on Acting FM-equivalent 
Monsignor Pietro Parolin, Charge solicited clarification of 
recent press reports of Vatican willingness to help mediate a 
resolution to the current standoff in Najaf.  Parolin 
responded that the Holy See was eager to hear what the U.S. 
thought of the idea, which had first been floated August 15 
by al-Sadr \"spokesman\" Ahmad al-Shaybani.  Drawing from 
reftel, Charge said the proposal did not appear genuine. 
Al-Sadr was playing for time and playing to the media, but 
did not appear to be seriously interested in resolving the 
standoff.  Moreover, his broader agenda -- to disrupt 
progress toward democracy and move towards a theocratic state 
infused with a radical Shi\'a outlook -- was contrary to U.S. 
and Holy See goals for Iraq. 
 
3. (C) Parolin expressed appreciation for the U.S. 
perspective, noting that since this issue first came to their 
attention, the Holy See had not had any input on the 
coalition attitude toward such mediation.  He said that 
Cardinal Sodano had told him that the media was \"persecuting\" 
him for a response on the plane back from the Pope\'s trip to 
Lourdes, which had prompted the Secretary of State to issue 
his first statement on the matter to the effect that \"if 
requested, the Pope will allow this mediation.\"  He 
elaborated further, noting that the \"whole endeavor of the 
Pope and the Holy See is an endeavor of mediation,\" and that 
he could envisage a \"good offices\" mediation aimed at 
encouraging concerned parties to talk.  Sodano had also 
condemned ongoing killings in Najaf as \"a dishonor for Islam\" 
and appealed for respect for the sacred character of the city. 
 
4. (C)  Following continued media speculation, Parolin said 
the Vatican press office issued a further clarification 
August 17 in which it stressed the general nature of the 
Vatican offer, since the Vatican had never actually received 
any formal request for mediation.  The Vatican spokesman 
explained that \"the Holy See is always ready to help the 
parties so they can talk and dialogue, on the condition that 
there really is a will to undertake peaceful ways for the 
solution of conflicts.\"  CDA noted that the recent statements 
from the al-Sadr spokesman, which attempted to portray the 
mediation as a Papal initiative -- and not something Al-Sadr 
had first raised -- offered further confirmation that the 
proposal was not intended to be taken seriously. 
 
5. (C)  Parolin indicated that should there ever be interest 
in Vatican mediation, their Nuncio in Baghdad, Fernando 
Filoni, would likely undertake such an effort.  At the same 
time, the Holy See would be willing to send a special envoy 
if the occasion should ever arise.  He said the Nuncio 
personally had no further details on the alleged al-Sadr 
proposal.  The Nuncio had observed publicly that it would be 
\"useless to make predictions until (al-Sadr) clarifies his 
real intentions.\"   Parolin said he understood that the 
disarmament of al-Sadr\'s forces remained the sticking point 
in any durable political solution to the standoff. 
 
6. (C) Parolin did express the Holy See\'s mounting concern 
about the flight of Christians from Iraq in the wake of the 
recent bombings of Christian churches.  The Vatican has heard 
that 40,000 Christians had fled since the attacks, primarily 
to Syria and Jordan, compounding an exodus that had begun in 
the wake of the war.  Despite the Chaldean community\'s deep 
historic roots in Iraq, Christians were becoming identified 
with the West and with the military presence. 
 
7. (C) Parolin queried whether the U.S. had concerns about 
Iran\'s role in the Najaf uprising, and said the Holy See 
would be interested in hearing if there were firm indications 
 
of Iranian involvement.  Parolin also asked about the UN\'s 
role, and when it would step forward to play a greater role. 
Charge conveyed a copy of USAID\'s recent summary of progress 
in Iraq, \"A Year in Iraq,\" noting that despite problems there 
were positive developments.  Parolin welcomed this 
information, but concluded that until the security situation 
improved significantly, the outlook for further progress 
would be bleak.

Summary

1.  (C) Holy See Acting Foreign Minister equivalent Parolin 
told Charge August 18 that the Holy See was on the same page 
with the U.S. on most UNGA initiatives.  On cloning, Charge 
emphasized the Holy See\'s potential to influence Catholic 
countries to support a ban on human cloning.  Parolin 
emphasized the Holy See\'s agreement with the U.S. position 
and promised to support fully UN efforts to ban embryonic 
cloning.  He rejected the suggestion that the Holy See\'s UN 
mission had sent mixed messages on the issue last year, 
insisting that their widely disseminated position paper was 
strongly behind a complete ban.  Parolin suggested that the 
U.S. do more to make the scientific case for the 
possibilities of adult stem cell research as an alternative 
to embryonic stem cells as a means to build support for the 
ban.  On human trafficking, Parolin expressed support for the 
U.S. initiative to increase focus on child sex tourism, and 
suggested that Permanent Observer Migliore might make a 
statement on the issue in his UNGA intervention.  Turning to 
economic issues, Parolin agreed with Charge that developing 
nations had to take responsibility for their own economic and 
social development, but insisted that internal initiatives 
had to be bolstered by aid from a reformed international 
system.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Holy See, U.S. on Same Page for UNGA 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (SBU) Charge reviewed the U.S. UNGA priorities with the 
Holy See\'s Acting Foreign Minister equivalent Monsignor 
Pietro Parolin August 18, drawing on ref (a) points.  Parolin 
offered strong support for U.S. priorities on cloning, 
trafficking, and democracy, and support with caveats on the 
global development and Middle East priorities.  Embassy had 
shared points prior to the meeting, and Parolin offered the 
following comments. 
 
--------------------- 
Banning Human Cloning 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Charge began by thanking Parolin for the Holy See\'s 
recent strong statement against all forms of human cloning 
issued in the wake of the recent UK decision to permit 
expanded cloning for therapeutic purposes.  Parolin responded 
that the Holy See\'s unequivocal position on the issue was 
well-known, and noted the close agreement between the Vatican 
and USG on the issue.  Charge raised points from ref (b), 
emphasizing the opportunity the Holy See\'s UN mission had, 
particularly among predominantly Catholic countries, to 
expand support for the Costa Rican resolution banning all 
forms of embryonic human cloning.  Charge stressed that an 
active role by Permanent Observer Archbishop Migliore could 
be crucial to several countries, not least of all Poland. 
After last year\'s lobbying efforts, Charge noted, some 
countries appear to have been left with the impression that 
the Holy See was willing to accept the Belgian compromise on 
the issue.  As it happened, the closeness of the vote showed 
that any such misconception may have been decisive. 
 
4.  (C) (Comment: A Polish diplomat accredited to the Holy 
See subsequently told us that he had found the Holy See\'s 
diplomacy on the cloning issue last year \"strange.\"  He said 
that in 2003, the Nuncio to Poland had passed the Vatican 
paper on the subject not to the Polish Foreign Ministry, but 
to the Bishops\' Conference.  This approach did not ensure 
maximum exposure for the document.  Our contact was unaware 
of the extent of lobbying by the Nunciature this year; in 
fact, before we spoke to him he had not been aware that the 
issue was to be taken up again.  End Comment.) 
 
5.  (C) Parolin acknowledged that there had been some 
internal discussion within the Holy See at the outset of the 
UN deliberations last year on whether to support the Belgian 
compromise, but he insisted that the Vatican had rejected 
that position and gone full speed ahead for the total ban. 
He maintained that Archbishop Migliore at the UN had been 
committed to the Holy See\'s position, and may have simply 
adopted \"tactics\" that were misunderstood.  Migliore, he 
added, had hoped to avoid dividing the international 
 
community on the issue.  Parolin stressed that there had been 
\"constant communication\" on the issue between Migliore and 
the Secretariat of State.  The Permanent Observer 
continuously updated the Vatican on his lobbying efforts in 
New York, and advised which countries the Secretariat should 
approach at the Vatican.  Parolin said he expected continuing 
close cooperation this year, and welcomed U.S. suggestions on 
countries that might be most susceptible to Vatican pressure. 
 
6.  (SBU) Parolin observed that while the Holy See would 
concentrate on the moral side of the argument, the U.S. might 
be able to sway some missions by being more aggressive in 
making the scientific case for alternatives to embryonic stem 
cell research.  The Vatican continues to believe that the 
scientific argument will likely be the most compelling for 
countries on the fence, and if alternatives to embryonic 
research can be shown to be credible, these countries will 
then have an acceptable foundation for supporting a ban on 
embryonic research. 
 
----------------- 
Human Trafficking 
----------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Parolin, who represented the Holy See and spoke at 
Post\'s recent anti-trafficking conference (ref c), wanted to 
know more on how TIP would fit into the UNGA agenda and what 
specific initiatives we would be pursuing.  He expressed 
support for the U.S. goal of increasing the international 
focus on child sex tourism, and suggested that Archbishop 
Migliore might make a statement on the issue.  Charge 
encouraged this idea and went on to discuss further 
collaboration between the U.S. and Holy See on the issue. 
(Note: Post plans to increase outreach to seminarians 
studying in Rome to raise the profile of the \"demand\" aspect 
of TIP -- an aspect of the problem that priests might well be 
able to address from the pulpit or in their 
mentoring/pastoral roles.  End Note.) 
 
8.  (SBU) Charge also suggested that pastoral guidance from 
the Vatican on trafficking could be a big boost for anti-TIP 
efforts around the world.  He noted the usefulness of a 2002 
anti-TIP document put out by the Nigerian Bishops\' 
Conference, and guidance that Pontifical Councils had 
published on other subjects (e.g., the Council for Health 
Care on the pastoral response to drug addiction and abuse). 
Parolin seemed intrigued, and promised to speak to the 
Council for Migrants and Itinerants (nominal lead 
organization on TIP at the Vatican) to explore ways of 
expanding Holy See engagement against trafficking. 
 
-------------------------- 
Advancing Economic Freedom 
-------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Turning to economic issues, Parolin agreed that 
developing nations had to take responsibility for their own 
economic and social development and focus on good governance 
and anti-corruption initiatives.  In the Vatican\'s view, 
however, there had to be a balanced approach to the issue, in 
which these internal initiatives were bolstered by expanded 
aid from a reformed international system.  \"The international 
community has a duty to help these countries,\" Parolin 
insisted. \"They cannot do it alone.\"  Charge agreed that a 
balanced approach was needed, but suggested that UN debates 
had not reflected this balance, focusing almost exclusively 
on the international institutions and largely ignoring the 
critical steps countries needed to take domestically to 
promote economic growth. 
 
------------------------ 
Democracy, Anti-Semitism 
------------------------ 
 
10.  (SBU) In reference to our other UNGA priorites, Parolin 
said the Holy See agreed fully with U.S. efforts to promote 
democracy and build a greater voice for democratic countries 
within the UN.  He also indicated that the Holy See would be 
supportive of a UNGA resolution on anti-Semitism, noting that 
the Holy See had supported the OSCE\'s  anti-Semitism 
declaration and believed a similar resolution at the UN would 
be useful.  Charge reviewed U.S. concerns about anti-Israel 
resolutions and committees.  Parolin acknowledged U.S. 
concerns, but said there was an urgent need to revitalize the 
Road Map and restart some form of peace process in the 
region.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Pope John Paul II is returning a copy of an 
historic icon of the Virgin Mary to the Russian Orthodox 
Church, a gesture he hopes will help thaw relations between 
Rome and Moscow.  The Pope had wanted to return the icon to 
Moscow in person, but continued coolness from Orthodox 
Patriarch Alexei II to a Papal visit prompted the Pope to 
entrust the return to a high-level Vatican delegation. 
Alexei has downplayed the Pope\'s conciliatory gesture, 
taking great pains to emphasize that the image of Our Lady 
of Kazan is not the revered historic icon, but \"one of many 
copies.\"  The recent visit to Rome by the Ecumenical 
Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew I (ref a), and a 
few hopeful signs for Catholics in Russia have given the 
Vatican\'s Orthodox watchers some hope for better times in 
this ecumenical relationship.  However, the predominant 
view in Vatican City is that that this gesture is unlikely 
to be reciprocated as long as Alexei II remains Patriarch. 
End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Icon Returns to Russia 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) Pope John Paul II has decided to return a copy of an 
historic icon of the Virgin Mary to the Russian Orthodox 
Church.  At a farewell event in Vatican City August 25, the 
Pontiff expressed his hope that the gesture would 
contribute to efforts to bring Rome and Moscow a step 
closer to unity.  The icon, a copy of the precious Madonna 
of Kazan, probably dating from the seventeenth or 
eighteenth century, was likely taken out of Russia in the 
early twentieth century.  It changed hands several times in 
ensuing years until it was exhibited at the World\'s Fair in 
New York in 1964-65.  An American Catholic organization 
later bought the icon, and gave it to the Pope in 1993. 
Although John Paul II would have preferred to return the 
icon personally, the cool response to his wish by Orthodox 
Patriarch Alexei II left the Pope with little choice but to 
entrust the task to a high-level Vatican delegation led by 
the Head of the Pontifical Council for Christian Unity, 
Cardinal Walter Kasper.  Kasper and his team, including 
Washington\'s Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, will hold talks 
with Orthodox officials on the margins of the hand-over 
ceremony scheduled for August 28 (ref b). 
 
--------------------------- 
Patriarch Downplays Gesture 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Orthodox Patriarch Alexei II has downplayed the 
Pope\'s conciliatory gesture, taking great pains to 
emphasize that the image of Our Lady of Kazan is not the 
revered historic icon, but \"one of many copies.\"  When the 
Vatican floated the idea that the Pope might personally 
present Alexei with the icon, the Russian prelate told 
journalists that there was no reason for the Pope to be 
involved in the transfer, since the icon is not the 
original.  The Patriarch further called for the Holy See to 
match its gesture with actions in putting an end to what it 
regards as proselytism among Russia\'s Orthodox communities 
- a charge the Vatican rejects 
 
------------------------------- 
But Other Orthodox See Goodwill 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) Despite the lack of authenticity, public interest 
in the icon has been high, and the gesture has been widely 
seen as a sincere effort to improve relations with the 
Orthodox Church.  A large crowd, including Orthodox clergy, 
took part in the August 25 weekly Papal audience at which 
the Pope bade farewell to the icon, which he has kept in 
his private chapel.  The Pope responded to one of them in a 
voice stronger than we have heard recently, saying that \"it 
is with deep emotion that I . . . give thanks to Divine 
Providence which has allowed me today to send to the 
venerable Patriarch of Moscow and all Russians, the gift of 
this holy icon.\"  At the end of the ceremony Catholic and 
Orthodox clergy processed out of the hall together.  Rome- 
based media have reported enthusiasm for the Pope\'s gesture 
from Orthodox clergy in Rome, and noted that a group of 
Moscow Catholics has asked Catholic Archbishop Tadeusz 
Kondrusiewicz if it can venerate the icon when it arrives 
in Russia.  However, Kondrusiewicz made it clear that 
ecumenical courtesy would mean Patriarch Alexei would be 
 
 
the first to see the icon. 
 
-------------------------- 
Some Good News from Russia 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) While the Pope has not gotten his long-awaited 
invitation to Russia, the Holy See has been buoyed by 
recent news that the Russian government has given the 
Catholic diocese of Saratov full legal recognition. 
Similar status has already been given to the Catholic 
archdiocese in Moscow, and church officials are hoping to 
have the same courtesy extended to the remaining two 
dioceses in Siberia.  The legal status facilitates the 
churches activities, including new construction and 
education. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Comment: Low Expectations of Alexei 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.(SBU) Alexei\'s dismissive attitude towards Vatican 
reconciliation efforts has been a constant in Catholic 
Russian Orthodox relations in recent years.  The Patriarch 
has repeatedly condemned alleged Catholic proselytism on 
Orthodox turf and warned against Rome\'s initiatives to 
shore up its presence in Russia by elevating the status of 
its ecclesiastical jurisdictions.  From the Holy See\'s 
perspective, it seems that all gestures of rapprochement 
are automatically snubbed and treated with paranoid 
suspicion. 
 
7.  (SBU) Despite Alexei\'s continued snubs, Pope John Paul 
II and the Vatican can be expected to continue their 
efforts to reach out to the Russian Orthodox.  However, it 
is clear that this relationship will remain more difficult 
than the more promising relations the Holy See enjoys with 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the \"first among equals\" 
in the Orthodox world.  The Holy See knows that its 
gestures towards the Russian Orthodox are unlikely to be 
reciprocated in any meaningful way while Alexei II is 
Patriarch.  Nevertheless, the Vatican, with its ability to 
take the long view, is willing to wait -- having already 
survived the more than ten centuries of separation between 
the two churches.  In the meantime, the Holy See will 
continue to press for closer cooperation and \"communion\" to 
combat what it regards as the common threat to the Roman 
Catholic and Orthodox worlds from Europe\'s aggressive 
secularism.  End comment.

SUBJECT: Vatican Conference Lends Support to Gordon Brown\'s 
International Finance Facility 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) A July 9 Vatican seminar on \"Poverty and 
Globalization: Financing for Development gave an implicit 
Holy See blessing for UK Chancellor Gordon Brown\'s 
International Finance Facility (IFF).  Brown sold the IFF 
as an innovative finance mechanism that could increase 
funding to meet the UN Millennium Development Goal of 
halving extreme poverty by 2015.  The Pope, in a letter to 
the conference, called for increased foreign aid and 
welcomed the IFF as \"an innovative solution\" to this end. 
The high-level conference also brought together Cardinal 
Cormac Murphy-O\'Connor, Archbishop of Westminster, Inge 
Kaul, UN Development Program, Jack Boorman of the IMF, as 
well as representatives from the World Bank, International 
Cooperation for Development and Solidarity, the UN 
Executive Coordinator for Financing for Development, and 
the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Finance Facility Receives Papal Blessing 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) In an effort to push for movement on the Holy 
See\'s priority global development goals  debt reduction 
for highly indebted poor countries and new financing for 
development  the Pontifical Council of Justice and Peace 
brought together leading voices in international finance to 
provoke discussion on what the Pope termed \"creativity in 
charity.\"  According to Council sources, the conference was 
the brainchild of Cardinal Murphy-O\'Connor and was designed 
to offer UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown a 
platform to drum up support for his IFF proposal. 
 
3. (U) The Pope warmly obliged by welcoming the IFF as part 
of a \"search for innovative solutions.\"  In a letter read 
to the Conference, the Pope emphasized the Holy See\'s 
strong support for the millennium goal of halving the 
number of people living in poverty by the year 2015. 
Citing the Holy See\' \"preferential option for the poor\" - 
he urged development-goal advocates to show creativity in 
pursuing new sources of financing so that \"ever more 
effective ways may be found of achieving a more just 
distribution of the world\'s resources.\"  While 
acknowledging that considerable progress has already been 
made in reducing the debt burden for poor countries, the 
Pope emphasized that \"more is needed if developing 
countries are to escape the crippling effects of 
underinvestment.\"  Significantly, the Pope balanced his 
call for increased foreign aid with a caution to recipient 
countries of their \"obligation to demonstrate transparency 
and accountability\" in the use made of international 
assistance. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Kickstarting Millennium Development Goals 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) A central motivation behind the Vatican\'s engagement 
is the mounting concern that, at current trends, the 
Millennium Development Goals will be, as Gordon Brown 
characterized them, \"another set of promises set, reset, 
and reset again and then only betrayed.\"  In his 
presentation, Brown offered a bleak assessment of prospects 
for meeting education, health, mortality, and poverty 
goals.  The IMF\'s Jack Boorman echoed Brown\'s concern 
noting that if MDG goals are to be met or even approached, 
\"substantially more financing will be needed.\"  According 
to Cardinal Martino, Head of the Holy See\'s Council for 
Justice and Peace, the Vatican hopes that the Pope\'s 
support of the project will spark greater international 
support to reach the Millennium Development Goals. 
 
----------------------------- 
Brown Calls for \"New Compact\" 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Beyond building support for the IFF, Gordon Brown 
made a broader call for \"a new compact between developed 
and developing countries\" in which developing countries 
would devise their own poverty-reduction plans that would 
eliminate corruption while the wealthier countries would 
agree to open markets, curb agricultural protectionism, and 
finance debt relief, education, health, and economic 
development.  This echoed Cardinal Cormac Murphy O\'Connor\'s 
 
 
opening remarks in which he called for finding \"new ways to 
deliver on our promises.\"  \"Either we have the generosity 
to lift the poor of the world out of the mire,\" he warned, 
\"or we face a crisis of huge proportions.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
The Holy See will support any mechanism that will increase 
funding for international aid and development, especially 
as international aid as a percentage of GNP is dropping 
worldwide.  At the same time, the Pope\'s admonition that 
recipient government\'s have obligations to demonstrate 
transparency and accountability reflects a welcome 
recognition that aid flows in the absence of domestic 
reform will not allow the world to meet its Millenium 
Goals.  The British message, as delivered by Chancellor 
Brown, tracked closely with the Holy See\'s views, and they 
have continued to affirm their support for the IFF in 
recent meetings with developed and developing country 
ambassadors.  Not all participants were sold on the IFF as 
a mechanism, but all agreed that more needs to be done to 
ensure that promises made are kept.

REF: SECSTATE 184111 
 
1. (U) This is Embassy Vatican\'s response to reftel 
concerning difficulties encoutered at U.S. ports of entry. 
The most egregious recent case that has come to our attention 
is that of Monsignor Philip Najim, a British citizen and the 
senior representative of the Chaldean Catholic Church to the 
Vatican (The Chaldean Catholic community, with ancient roots 
in Iraq and Syria, now has several churches in the U.S, 
particularly in Michigan and California.)  Monsignor Najim, a 
close Embassy contact who has met with the Ambassador on 
developments in Iraq relating to the Christian community, 
experienced severe problems and delay when he entered the 
U.S. at JFK airport approximately two weeks ago. 
 
2. (SBU) Monsignor Najim, (DPOB: 26 Sept 1959, Baghdad. UK 
Ppt # 7032235843) senior representative of the Chaldean 
Catholic Church to The Holy See, arrived at JFK on August 17. 
 He was requested to go to secondary, where he  was made to 
wait for over four hours, finally  fingerprinted, 
photographed and told he was subject to Special Registration 
procedures.  Meanwhile, Catholic officials waiting at JFK to 
pick him up had no idea what had become of him.  Najim is 
extremely upset about the incident, and how he was treated 
during the process.  Some of his colleagues have suggested 
approaching the media to publicize the incident as an example 
of \"persecution of people of Iraqi descent,\" but Monsignor 
Najim has so far requested that they not publicize the 
incident.  He contacted Post from the U.S. soon after this 
incident to relay his concerns. 
 
3. (U) Post has contacted DHS representatives at Embassy Rome 
regarding Monsignor Najim\'s case.  The Chaldean Church has 
been generally supportive of U.S. actions in Iraq, and has 
been an important voice of moderation and religious 
understanding.  At a time when we are trying to build and 
maintain ties with leaders of the new Iraq, this incident has 
set back our relations with an important actor.

RISING THREATS TO PERSONNEL 
 
 
1.Caritas, the humanitarian aid agency of the Catholic 
Church, will continue operations to support Iraqi 
reconstruction despite a recent increase in the threat 
level to its personnel.  In a statement issued September 
10, responding in part to the abduction of two Italian aid 
workers in Baghdad, Caritas said that its Iraq office works 
primarily with children and young mothers, administering 14 
centers in the Baghdad, Mosul, Karakoush, Kirkuk and Bassra 
regions.  Two of these are jointly administered with the 
Red Crescent. 
 
2.More than 100 local nutrition, engineering and 
technical experts, along with local volunteers have to date 
e 
assisted some 24,000 children and 10,000 mothers and 
pregnant women with two million euros of overseas aid. 
Part of this figure has been spent on supplying hospitals 
in Baghdad and Mosul, as well as seven clinics.  Other 
Caritas projects include feeding programs for at-risk 
groups -- the homeless, elderly, disabled, orphans and 
widows without family support.  Food aid is being 
supplemented by projects to restore clean water.  Planned 
reconstruction work for homes destroyed in fighting is on 
hold at present because of the security situation. 
 
3.Comment:  Caritas\' international federation will 
continue to provide partnership funding for Caritas Iraq\'s 
activities in Iraq.  Using local personnel, Caritas lowers 
the risk of attack or abduction for its staff.  Caritas has 
publicly condemned terrorist acts that target aid workers.

Firmness Against Terror and Dialogue Among Religions 
 
REF:  A) 03 Vatican 4289; B) Vatican 3308 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (U) The Sant\'Egidio Community brought together over 
7,000 religious and political leaders September 5-7 in 
Milan to promote inter-religious dialogue and understanding 
as a means to combat terrorism and build peace.  The shadow 
of the Beslan massacre hung over the annual gathering, 
reinforcing the Pope\'s call to conference participants to 
\"withstand the logic of violence, revenge, and hatred, and 
persevere in dialogue.\"  Recognizing the religious roots of 
terrorism and many international conflicts, religious 
leaders addressed their critical role in overcoming the 
bitterness and misunderstanding that gives rise to terror 
and war.  Conference participants repeatedly and strongly 
condemned violence in the name of religion, concluding that 
those who resort to violence \"curse the cause for which 
they fight.\"  Significantly, recalling September 11, the 
Pope\'s message to the conference called for \"firmness and 
resoluteness\" in the face of terror.  The wide-ranging 
meeting also covered Iraq, the Israel-Palestinian Conflict, 
HIV/AIDS, and freedom of religion for Catholics in Russia. 
Ambassador Nicholson and S/GAC Chief Medical Officer Mark 
Dybul both spoke and outlined U.S. efforts to combat 
HIV/AIDS and promote development in the developing world, 
emphasizing U.S. support for the efforts of faith-based 
organizations such as Sant\'Egidio.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Promoting Dialogue in the Face of Terror 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The Sant\'Egidio Community\'s annual inter-faith 
conference brought together over 7,000 representatives of 
major world religions, governments, and NGOs to explore 
ways that religious leaders can forge inter-religious 
understanding and combat religiously rooted terrorism and 
violence.  Speakers, including the Pope (with a written 
message), EU President Romano Prodi, Italian Foreign 
Minister Franco Frattini, and Israeli Chief Rabbi Yona 
Metzger condemned terrorism and urged both dialogue to 
build understanding and action to address cultural, moral, 
economic, and political roots of terror.  The annual 
conference is part of the Sant\'Egidio Community\'s effort to 
continue the dialogue launched at the Pope\'s 1986 World Day 
of Prayer for Peace in Assisi and promote a \"spirit\" of 
inter-religious dialogue that John Paul II has worked hard 
to advance during his pontificate.  The Community, with 
40,000 members from 60 countries, is active worldwide in 
conflict resolution, HIV/AIDS treatment, and inter- 
religious dialogue, and mediated the 1991 Mozambique peace 
accord. 
 
3.  (U) This year\'s conference, taking place in the days 
after the Beslan tragedy, began with drama when the 
Orthodox Russian Bishop of Beslan, Eparch Feofan Ashurkov, 
who had been in Beslan during the hostage taking, described 
his profound sadness at seeing children\'s bodies in the 
wreckage.  Asserting that \"only devils masquerading as men 
could carry out such deeds,\" the Eparch said the challenge 
now was to stop this tragedy from breeding more of the 
same.  Society, he said, needed to \"save people from 
uncontrolled rage.\"  Anthony Lobos, the Catholic Bishop of 
Islamabad, caught the mood of the conference when he 
asserted: \"we cannot have this conference in a vacuum, 
intellectually separate from the terrorist acts we are here 
to combat.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Pope Recalls September 11; Calls for Firmness 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) With the conference occurring on the eve of the 
third anniversary of September 11, the Pope in his message 
to participants specifically recalled \"that terrible 
September 11th, 2001 when death reached the very heart of 
the United States.\"  Noting that in the three years since, 
threats and destruction from terrorism had increased, he 
concluded that \"the fight against the death-makers 
doubtless requires firmness and resoluteness.\"  He also 
urged that every effort be made to eradicate the \"misery, 
the despair, the emptiness of heart\" that has led to this 
drift toward terror.  In an implicit reference to his 
opposition to the war in Iraq, the Pope also observed that 
 
 
\"war throws open the doors to the abyss of evil . . . 
[which] is why war should always be considered a defeat.\" 
The Pope also emphasized that religions have a critical 
role to play in reminding people the world over that peace 
is always possible and showing people the way to \"eradicate 
the seeds of bitterness and misunderstanding embedded in 
culture and life.\"  He rejected the attitude that a clash 
of civilizations or religions is inevitable, and instead 
called for religions to emphasize the \"extreme dignity of 
every man and woman.\" 
 
5.  (U) The Pope\'s point man for inter-religious dialogue, 
Cardinal Walter Kasper, elaborated the Holy See\'s thoughts 
on the role of believers in disarming terror.  Kasper 
called for a religious response on three levels:  1) 
Recognition that all religions share texts that prohibit 
violence, terrorism, and suicide.  In this regard, Kasper 
pointed out that according to Koranic principles, suicide 
attackers should not be venerated as martyrs, but condemned 
as criminals; 2) Efforts to make clear to believers of all 
faiths that terrorism is a negation of the dignity of man 
and an offense to God, and that efforts to justify terror 
in the name of God are grave abuses that amount to 
profanation; 3) Support for legitimate actions to defeat 
terrorism. 
 
6.  (U) In explaining this last point, Kasper provided one 
of the most detailed public descriptions to date of Vatican 
thinking on how to combat terrorism.  Because terrorism 
today has become a threat to all humanity, he argued, \"we 
cannot defend the dignity of mankind and the peace only 
with pious words; we have to defend them also with 
actions.\"  Specifically, he maintained that the fight 
against terror required military and policy interventions. 
\"Democracies must be prepared -- even if it could mean the 
loss of human life -- to defend liberty with force.\"  At 
the same time, he cautioned that democracies cannot employ 
the same methods they condemn in terrorists.  This means, 
he explained, that we cannot employ torture, cannot launch 
preventive wars that abolish the rules of just war, and 
cannot use targeted assassinations without a fair process 
that precedes them.  \"The barbarism of terrorism,\" he 
cautioned, \"cannot make us turn backward in respect to the 
advances of the civilized world and respond with 
barbarism.\"  Kasper also called for actions that address 
the conditions that favor the expansion of terror, whether 
social, economic, or political.  Finally, he called on 
religions to use all of their spiritual resources to resist 
terror by clearly and publicly distancing themselves from 
terror, and unmasking the religions faade of terrorists. 
 
---------------------------- 
Iraq: U.S. in the Crosshairs 
---------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) The session on Iraq predictably generated sharp 
criticism of the U.S.  Although most panelists agreed that 
Iraqis were glad to be rid of Saddam Hussein and welcomed 
the opportunity to pursue democracy, they also maintained 
that Iraqis are growing more suspicious of the U.S.-led 
coalition and frustrated by the lack of security. 
Auxiliary Bishop of Baghdad Shlemon Warduni said the 
continued fighting, lack of essential services, and heavy- 
handed behavior of the coalition forces have fueled the 
impression that U.S. oil interests -- not concern for the 
Iraqi people -- had been behind the invasion.  To applause 
from the largely European audience he said: \"take the black 
gold, we don\'t want it, we want peace, we want a future for 
our children.\"  Muhammad Bashar Sharif, spokesperson of the 
Sunni Iraqi Council of Ulema, similarly expressed anger at 
the U.S. government for describing Iraq as a \"crusade,\" and 
concluded, \"this is a dirty war,\" which he said was 
\"polluted by U.S. unilateralism, exaggeration of a WMD 
threat, and oil interests.\"  These statements were echoed 
later in a conversation with an Irish Nobel Laureate, who 
told PolOff, \"of course we all know the war was about oil.\" 
 
8.  (U) Shortcomings of the U.S-led occupation of Iraq 
formed a consistent theme, with speakers criticizing the 
lack of security and a perceived denial of freedom of 
speech and press.  Bishop Warduni focused on human rights, 
suggesting that the U.S. was denying Iraqis their \"human 
right to safety and security.\"  Ahmad Al Tayyib, rector of 
Al-Azhar University in Egypt, accused U.S. forces of 
repressing legitimate Iraqi dissent, and \"using the tactics 
of terrorists.\"  When an audience member suggested that 
under Saddam the panelists would not have been allowed to 
 
 
speak at an inter-religious conference in Milan, he was cut 
short by Vatican Cardinal Moussa Daoud, Prefect of the 
Vatican Congregation Eastern Churches.  While refraining 
from mentioning the U.S. by name, UAE presidential advisor 
Ibrahim Ezzedine evoked another round of applause when he 
asserted that: \"we all know that the occupation is 
responsible\" for the uprising and violence.  Beyond their 
complaints about the U.S., panelists had few suggestions or 
solutions for ending the violence in Iraq. 
 
-------- 
HIV/AIDS 
-------- 
 
9.  (U) Against the difficulties in Iraq, the panel on 
HIV/AIDS helped focus attention on the good news of U.S. 
efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.  Ambassador 
Nicholson discussed HIV/AIDS as a moral, political and 
economic challenge, emphasizing that \"HIV/AIDS and other 
health threats such as tuberculosis and malaria are 
damaging social cohesion and economic strength, blocking 
the very development goals the countries and concerned 
members of the international community are seeking to 
promote.\"  The Ambassador continued by placing the 
administration\'s efforts to fight AIDS in the context of 
broader U.S. humanitarian efforts to prevent hunger, combat 
poverty, and promote development. Dr. Mark Dybul, Chief 
Medical Officer in the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS 
Coordinator, said that by pledging $15 billion over five 
years, \"no leader or country has shown such extraordinary 
leadership and action in the global fight against HIV/AIDS 
as President Bush and the American people.\" 
 
10.  (U) Both the Ambassador and Dybul promoted U.S. 
humanitarian aid partnerships with faith-based 
organizations. As Dybul observed, \"the Emergency Plan 
cannot succeed in treatment, prevention and care, and in 
building local capacity without the faith community.\" This 
linkage tied in with Concepcion Valls\' discussion of 
Sant\'Egidio\'s DREAM HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment 
program in Mozambique.  The project, which is indirectly 
receiving some U.S. funding and is seeking more, has 
provided medical care to 5,000 HIV-positive patients, and 
counseling and AIDS tests to 11,000 more.  On September 10 
Sant\'Egidio\'s DREAM program was awarded the USD 1.6 million 
Balzan prize, which will likely fund the full extension of 
the program to Malawi and initial stages of expansion to 
Nigeria and Tanzania. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Boosting Relations with Orthodox 
-------------------------------- 
 
11.  (SBU) One of the central fronts of inter-religions 
dialogues for the Holy See and Sant\'Egidio has been 
Catholic relations with the Orthodox world.  With an 
extensive Orthodox and Vatican presence, much of the 
dialogue took place on the margins of the conference. 
Cardinal Kasper, who recently returned from a trip to 
Moscow to return the Kazan icon (ref b), told the 
Ambassador that he had been very pleased with the 
atmosphere of his visit.  He said he was surprised to be 
greeted by a smiling Russian Patriarch Alexei, who embraced 
him as a brother.  Kasper stated that their traditionally 
difficult personal relationship was improving, as was the 
broader Catholic-Orthodox relationship.  He believed that 
\"the Orthodox are isolated and need [the Vatican] to reach 
Europe.\"  Significantly, Kasper told the Ambassador that 
the religious freedom situation for Christians in Russia 
was improving: Catholic priests are getting visas, and in 
August a second Catholic diocese, Suratov, was given full 
legal status by the Russian government. 
 
---------------------------------- 
A U.N. for Religions in Jerusalem? 
---------------------------------- 
 
12.  (U) One of the more intriguing ideas to emerge from 
the conference was a proposal from Israel\'s Chief Rabbi 
Yona Metzger for the establishment of a \"United Nations of 
Religions\" -- a permanent assembly of religious leaders 
where representatives of world religions could meet and 
make common agreed statements on international 
developments.  Rabbi Metzger suggested that such an 
institution could help demonstrate the common values shared 
by different faiths -- particularly the sacredness of every 
human life -- and overcome growing perceptions of religious 
 
 
division.  Sant\'Egidio\'s Claudio Betti commented to DCM 
that the proposal was doubly significant as it represented 
one of the first statements he could recall of a senior 
Jewish leader discussing the possibility of Jerusalem 
serving as host to \"many religions.\" 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Signs of Thaw in Israel-Palestinian Dialogue 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
13.  (SBU) One of the Conference sessions that has 
traditionally generated the most heated exchanges has been 
that between Israeli and Palestinian representatives. \"What 
New Hope for an Old Conflict,\" the title of this year\'s 
session, suggested that the parties are recognizing that 
they need to rebuild the peace process.  Abed Alloun 
represented the Palestinian Authority, while Ehud Yaari, an 
Israeli television commentator, and Abraham Friedman of the 
Herzliya Center represented Israeli points of view. 
Sant\'Egidio\'s Betti said it was the most productive 
exchange he had seen in recent years between the two 
groups. \"They didn\'t fight, and the participants didn\'t get 
emotional,\" he noted, adding that both sides recognized 
that the path of the past few years had led nowhere, and 
that the time had come to rethink the way forward. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
14.  (SBU) Sant\'Egidio\'s success in attracting increasing 
numbers of religious and political leaders reflects a 
growing recognition of the potentially critical role that 
religious leaders can play in defusing sentiments of 
religious conflicts that contribute to terrorism and 
international and internal conflicts worldwide.  What was 
new this year, in the face of the Beslan massacre and 
continued attacks and kidnappings in Iraq, was the clear 
recognition on the part of religious leaders such as 
Cardinal Kasper that \"pious words\" were no longer enough to 
meet this threat, and that religious leaders needed to move 
to the forefront to unmask terrorists who try to hide 
behind a religious faade.  Sant\'Egidio is clearly in the 
forefront of groups working to promote dialogue with the 
Muslim world, but they have nevertheless been criticized 
both for attracting only moderates to dialogue and for 
engaging Muslim leaders who have made statements tolerating 
terror.  While acknowledging the continuing difficulty in 
attracting more hard-line Muslims to participate in 
dialogue, Betti defended the outreach to more radical 
elements.  \"These are the people we need to reach.  Unless 
someone in the West reaches out to them with a voice of 
sanity, they will continue to voice this craziness,\" he 
warned.  Just as St. Francis talked to the wolf, he said, 
the West needs to talk to the radical voices.

Summary

1. (U) To build support within the Holy See and overcome 
opposition within the Catholic Church, Embassy brought 
together scientists, ethicists, and developing nation 
farmers to address a one-day conference on the moral 
imperative of using biotechnology to feed the world\'s 
hungry.  Scientists from the United States and Italy 
presented the facts about GMOs, their applications and 
their benefits, debunking myths perpetrated by anti-biotech 
activists.  The FDA\'s Acting Commissioner Lester Crawford 
addressed biotech food safety concerns, while a prominent 
bioethicist and moral theologian explained the Catholic 
doctrinal position on the use of technology for the common 
good of mankind.  Farmers from the Philippines and South 
Africa extolled the economic, social and health benefits 
they personally had experienced using GM seeds.  Church- 
based anti-GMO activists who attended the conference left 
unconverted, but with many of their arguments undercut by 
the weight of scientific evidence and the compelling 
testimony of the developing country farmers.  Media 
coverage of the event was extensive in Italy and 
internationally.  Post appreciates the support and 
assistance provided for the conference from EB, HHS, the 
Acton Institute in Grand Rapids, Michigan and FODAG Rome. 
End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Moral Imperative to Feed the Hungry 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.(U) Ambassador Nicholson opened the September 24 
Conference, Feeding the Hungry, The Moral Imperative of 
Biotechnology,\" by observing that the suffering of so many 
in today\'s world of plenty was an affront to human dignity 
that presented a clear moral challenge.  To meet this 
challenge the world needed to take advantage of 
biotechnology\'s tremendous potential.  Criticizing Catholic 
activists who asserted during Zambia\'s food crisis in 2002 
that it would be better to let people starve than allow 
them to eat biotech food, the Ambassador urged the Holy See 
to use its moral voice on food safety and the potential of 
biotechnology by issuing a stronger statement on the issue. 
The Ambassador concluded that the worst form of cultural 
imperialism was to deny others opportunities to take 
advantage of new technologies to enhance the human 
condition.  The Ambassador also cited Pope John Paul II, 
who has stated that the correct application of technology 
could be a \"precious instrument\" in resolving the problems 
of hunger and disease. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Dimensions of Hunger:  How Biotech Can Help 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Tuskegee University Professor C.S. Prakash, whose 
research has quadrupled the nutritional content of the 
sweet potato, set the stage for the discussion by sketching 
the dimensions of the challenge facing the world in feeding 
our growing population.  While acknowledging progress as a 
result of the Green Revolution, particularly in India and 
China, Prakash noted that 800 million people go to be 
hungry every night and that half of sub Saharan Africans 
are undernourished -- a figure that will increase to 70 
percent by 2010.  Only by increasing agricultural 
productivity, he emphasized, could food needs be met.  And, 
one of the best tools to achieve this, was biotechnology, 
which could reduce loses from pests, develop greater 
resistance to drought and disease, reduce pesticide use, 
and enhance nutritional qualities of foods. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Confronting Opponents with Sound Science 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
4.(SBU) To make the scientific case for biotechnology, 
Embassy highlighted two of the best scientific minds on 
biotechnology, Dr. Peter Raven, a member of the Pontifical 
Science Academy and Director of the Missouri Botanical 
Gardens, and Dr. C.S. Prakash.  Bishop Marcelo Sanchez 
Sorondo, Chancellor of the Pontifical Academy for Sciences, 
and the co-host of the conference highlighted scientific 
evidence on the safety of GMOs and reiterated the Holy 
See\'s call for agricultural technology to be shared with 
the developing world.  At the same time, he asserted that 
intellectual property rights had to be applied in a way 
that permitted wider access to the benefits of scientific 
knowledge in the developing world.  Sanchez refuted 
accusations from within the Catholic Church that the 
Pontifical Academy had been bought by American biotech 
interests, pointing out that his academy was specifically 
tasked by the Pope with the study and debate of scientific 
issues in an atmosphere of intellectual freedom.  The study 
and debate of GMOs, he insisted, was totally consistent 
with the Academy\'s mission.  (Comment: Sanchez, a key 
Embassy ally in promoting a positive science-based 
assessment of GMOs from within the Holy See, received more 
than 100 e-mails from Catholics around the world 
complaining about the Academy\'s involvement in the 
conference. End Comment). 
 
5. (U) Dr. Peter Raven launched the scientific assault with 
a series of broadsides at the specious arguments emanating 
from Church circles opposed to GMOs and biotechnology.  He 
labeled as \"escapist\" and \"absurd\" the argument that food 
insecurity was essentially a distribution issue because 
there was enough food for all in the world.  According to 
Raven, there is not enough food being produced, and modern 
technologies to boost yield are essential for peoples\' 
survival.  Raven also dismissed safety arguments against 
GMOS, noting that there is not one recorded case of harm or 
illness resulting from consumption of GMOs.  He pointed 
out, for the benefit of the European purists intent on 
keeping the continent GMO free, that virtually all of the 
beer and cheese consumed around the world used 
biogenetically engineered materials. 
 
6. (U) Turning his fire toward biodiversity, Raven argued 
that nothing is more destructive of biodiversity than 
widespread, low-yield, traditional methods of agriculture, 
and that it is highly misleading to romanticize them. 
Raven said the development of GM crops, with precisely 
determined characteristics that allow them to survive in 
the diverse places they are grown promises not only major 
increases in productivity but a greatly enhanced ability to 
preserve biodiversity.  Raven successfully linked GMOs to 
decreased pesticide use and the consequent positive effects 
on human beings and the environment, noting that millions 
of birds and animals would live and the health of hundreds 
of thousands of people would be enhanced by a reduction in 
pesticide use made possible by biotechnology.  If half the 
maize, oil seed rape, sugar beet and cotton raised in 
Europe were genetically modified to resist pests, there 
would be a reduction of more than 14 million kilograms of 
pesticide, 20 million liters of diesel, and the prevention 
of 73,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide going into the 
atmosphere, he said. 
 
7.(U) Dr. C.S. Prakash reinforced Raven\'s arguments with 
concrete examples of current research and GMO use.  GM 
success stories included higher yields, reduced use of 
pesticides, nutritional increases and greater product 
freshness. Prakash extolled the benefits of GM products 
that were resilient to environmental problems - drought, 
flooding, salt water, and pests -- which had great impact 
t 
on food productivity worldwide.  The future total 
elimination of natural toxins, particularly in potatoes, as 
a result of GM was another powerful example of how GMOs 
could contribute to food safety.  To advocates of the 
health advantages of non-GM products, Prakash pointed out 
that GM foods are being developed with less bad fats, 
 
 
allergens and sugars.  Prakash urged that GM seeds and 
other agricultural technology be made affordable and 
accessible to farmers in developing nations.  He said he 
advocates GMO use because it will bring sustainability, 
purchasing power and wealth.  Prakash lamented that the 
promise of GMOs has not yet been fully realized because of 
a lack of funding, constraints imposed by national 
governments, poor public perception of GMO benefits, 
activist opposition and negative media portrayals.  Prakash 
said negative media on GMOs had a direct impact on funding 
and research, limiting what should be a powerful instrument 
for the developing world. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Real-Life Experience of Developing Country Farmers 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8.(U) Farmers from South Africa and the Philippines 
provided first-hand testimony on the benefits of GMOs for 
the developing world.  Clearly and simply they recounted 
their stories of transition from traditional crops to GMOs, 
and how their lives and those of their families and 
communities had been enhanced.  Edwin Paraluman from the 
Philippines explained that population increases in his 
country demanded the use of biotechnology.  His corn for 
animal feed was affected by the Asian corn warm, and 
spraying with toxic pesticides had previously been the only 
method to control the pest.  The first planting of BT corn 
resulted in immediate yield increases, with his profits up 
30 percent.  As a result, he was able to buy a refrigerator 
and a motorcycle for his family.  Paraluman said 
misinformation campaigns by anti-biotechnology activists in 
the Philippines impacted in GMO use.  The campaigns were 
based on ignorance and prejudices among the general 
population, he said, including the rumor that a person 
would become homosexual through contact with GM products. 
Despite this, the use of GM seed by farmers was spreading 
as they saw first hand the economic and health benefits of 
using the product. 
 
9.(U) South African farmer Sabina Khoza said using BT 
maize had resulted not only in increased income but more 
free time due to decreased weeding and spraying.  She had 
also been able to use her profits to diversify her crops. 
GMOs had also reduced local unemployment in her village as 
new workers were hired to bring in an increased harvest and 
manage a diversified production.  Khoza lauded the 
cooperation in South Africa between officials from the 
Ministry of Agriculture, educational institutes and farmers 
through which theory and practice met to ensure sound and 
safe procedures for the introduction of GM seed use.  Khoza 
said some 75 percent of the maize now used in her area was 
GM, with 25 percent of the crop coming from traditional 
maize so that farmers in South Africa could still choose 
what they wanted to grow.  For Khoza and her farming 
colleagues, most of them women, GM maize meant greater 
safety because of less handling of hazardous chemicals. 
She said health was a major issue in South Africa, 
especially for women farmers who were responsible for the 
care of their families.  From her own experience, Khoza 
said GM seed produced a high quality product, and its use 
was wiping out pests and disease.  She acknowledged concern 
about the cost of GM seed, but added that the investment 
thus far had proven worthwhile.  She also expressed concern 
about the potential impact that the use of GM seeds could 
have on international trade with countries that still 
banned GMOs, but said she was more concerned with food 
security issues for her local community.  Khoza closed by 
saying public awareness would be the key factor in whether 
or not GMOs are more widely accepted. 
 
10.(U) Dr. Carl Pray, from Rutgers University\'s 
Department of Agricultural Food and Resource Economics, who 
has done extensive research on the impact of biotechnology 
on farmers in developing countries, insisted that anti-GMO 
rhetoric was way ahead of the evidence.  Pray presented his 
study of BT cotton use in China, where it makes up 60 
percent of the national harvest.  China\'s farmers chose BT 
 
 
cotton because it makes economic sense, he explained.  They 
use fewer pesticides - from 60 kilos per hectare to eleven 
-- and reduce spraying from twenty times per year to five. 
Although yield increased a modest 8 percent, costs were 
down due to reduced labor and pesticide costs, thus 
increasing profit.  Pray said Chinese farmers who had 
suffered nausea and vomiting after frequent pesticide 
spraying also appreciated benefits to their health of using 
cotton.  On the question of \"who benefits\" from GMO use, 
Pray said China\'s farmers garnered 80 to 85 percent of the 
benefit while consumers received none due to government 
price controls.  Seed companies received a small benefit 
from GM seed sales.  Pesticide producers were the big 
losers. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
The Theological Case for Biotechnology 
-------------------------------------- 
 
11.(U) Respected bioethicist Father Gonzalo Miranda of 
the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum told conference 
delegates that it was not the church\'s role to be a 
scientific arbitrator -- that was for scientists.  What the 
Church could offer, according to Miranda, was an ethical 
reflection on how man\'s capacity to discover should be used 
to intervene in creation.  Noting that God gave man \"power\" 
over nature, he said that this power is supposed to be used 
for the good for humankind - in particular to combat 
hunger and illness.  While any intervention in nature had 
d 
consequences, science had to determine and assess risks. 
The potential risks and benefits of biotechnology, 
therefore, should be ethically assessed on a case-by-case 
basis with no blanket condemnation or approval.  In the 
framework of justice and solidarity, Miranda made clear 
that if GMOs represent a true opportunity in favor of 
development in poor countries, it \"would be a moral duty of 
solidarity to support their diffusion.\"  He pointedly 
added, \"to block GMOs a priori because of purely 
ideological positions or hidden economic interests would be 
a grave injustice.\"  To critics of the role of 
multinational companies, Miranda affirmed the Church\'s 
doctrine that profit and multinationals are not wrong or 
evil per se, but that both should be at the service of 
humankind.  Miranda concluded that justice demands that the 
public be fully informed about new technologies and that 
the developing world share in development and research to 
be able to find their own solutions to hunger and disease. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Biotech Regulation:  Ensuring Safety 
------------------------------------ 
 
12.(U) Acting FDA Commissioner Lester Crawford provided a 
detailed presentation of U.S. regulatory mechanisms for GM 
foods and other products, describing the extensive testing 
process biotech foods undergo to ensure food safety.  To 
date bioengineered foods have proven to be no different 
from their conventional counterparts, he explained. 
Crawford said the FDA and other relevant government 
agencies have drawn on their regulatory experience to help 
build regulatory frameworks in other countries.  He said 
workshops have been conducted in the Russian Federation, 
Mexico and for several South East Asian nations.  Crawford 
expressed his appreciation to the Pontifical Academy for 
the Sciences and to the Vatican for their openness to GMOs 
and recognition of their potential to enhance the ability 
to feed a hungry world. 
 
----------------------- 
Debunking Biotech Myths 
----------------------- 
 
 
13.(U) Keying off an open discussion with all panelists, 
Italian biology professor from the University of Milan, 
Piero Morandini, carefully debunked some of the classic 
 
 
myths and objections surrounding the use of GMOs. 
Responding to the charge that agricultural biotechnology 
was \"against nature,\" Morandini said that science does not 
support the notion that natural things are inherently 
superior to man made ones.  Such a position, according to 
Morandini, was essentially pagan where nature was 
considered a kind of goddess and environmentalism a form of 
religion in which man is the worst enemy of nature.  Dr. 
Morandini said arguments suggesting wealthy nations have no 
need of GMOs to increase or improve production are 
nullified by the facts.  Even Italy, where a majority of 
the population is opposed to GMOs, imports GM maize and 
soybeans for animal feed, as well as meat fed with GMO 
crops.  Taking on the charge that GMO\'s would diminish 
biodiversity, Morandini pointed out that preserving 
biodiversity is important, but doesn\'t address the fact 
that countries using indigenous varieties suffer 
malnutrition and hunger.  Since conventional crops and 
technologies have failed to provide food security, 
developing countries needed to be able to explore new crops 
that can end the cycle of bare subsistence.  Morandini 
concluded that much of the confusion about biotechnology 
within Church circles is born of ignorance and fueled by 
ideology. 
 
-------------- 
Media Coverage 
-------------- 
 
14.(U) The Conference, the third in an Embassy series of 
public outreach events that have previously addressed 
terrorism and human trafficking, garnered extensive, 
generally positive media coverage in U.S.-and Italian 
Catholic and non-Catholic media.  Avvenire, a national 
Italian Catholic daily, headlined its in-depth article: 
\"GMO:  No Condemnation; Evaluate Case by Case.\"  The 
article led with a quote from Fr. Miranda, underlining the 
often misrepresented and misunderstood position of the 
Vatican on GMOs, emphasizing that \"the Church does not 
consider genetically modified organisms as \'intrinsically 
immoral.\'\"  Coverage also included a pre-conference live 
interview with the Ambassador and Dr. Prakash on Vatican 
Radio, which boasts an international audience of tens of 
thousands of listeners in 40 languages, particularly on the 
African continent.  Vatican-watcher John Allen acknowledged 
Post\'s persistent efforts to engage the Vatican on the 
issue of biotechnology.  Pre-conference Q and A session 
with the Ambassador in the internationally distributed 
Zenit News Service, Catholic News Service and the Voice of 
America, highlighted that \"despite existing prejudice and 
concerns about biotechnology in many countries, Vatican 
officials believe genetic engineering is a modern science 
tool that should be explored to address hunger and 
malnutrition in the world.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
15.(SBU) This conference, the fourth outreach event on 
biotechnology hosted by Post over the past two years, was 
targeted at keeping pressure on the Holy See to adopt a 
stronger public position toward biotechnology and to ensure 
its diffusion among bishops in the developing world whose 
voice often plays a critical role in shaping public 
perceptions of whether a biotech food is safe to eat and 
moral to grow.  It also sought to respond to the Holy See\'s 
own call at the conclusion of its November 2003 conference 
on biotechnology (reftel) for further study and debate on 
the merits.  The fact that the Pontifical Science Academy 
was willing to co-sponsor a pro-biotech event with the 
United States was a major step forward, and reflects the 
growing recognition within the Holy See of biotechnology\'s 
potential.  This openness was reinforced last week by Prime 
Minister equivalent Cardinal Angelo Sodano\'s positive 
reference to the benefits of technology at the recent UN 
Food Summit in New York.  Biotech opponents, who had 
inundated the Pontifical Science Academy with angry e-mails 
 
 
prior to the conference, offered only muted criticism at 
the Conference in the face of the powerful scientific and 
personal evidence presented at the conference. 
 
16. (U) Embassy greatly appreciates the support for this 
conference provided by EB, the Department of Health and 
Human Services, and the Acton Institute.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) The Holy See and the Vatican-affiliated lay 
community Sant\'Egidio are actively promoting Christian- 
Jewish dialogue and initiatives to combat anti-Semitism. 
In October, delegations from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel 
and the Holy See\'s Commission for Religious Relations with 
the Jews met near Rome and issued a joint statement 
emphasizing their partnership and the sacred character of 
Jerusalem.  With Vatican support, the Pontifical Gregorian 
University is supplementing its already robust course 
offerings on Judaism and religious dialogue with an evening 
lecture series open to the public on Christian-Jewish 
relations.  Sant\'Egidio held what has become an annual 
march commemorating the expulsion of the Jews from Rome 
during WWII, and continues to promote inter-religious 
reconciliation in other venues, often including Muslims. 
The significant overlap between the goals of these 
initiatives and the USG\'s anti-Semitism and religious- 
tolerance goals offer opportunities for expanded 
collaboration with the Holy See and Sant\'Egidio.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Vatican, Jewish Delegations Meet for Dialogue 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Delegations from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, led 
by Rabbi Shar Yishuv Cohen, and the Holy See\'s Commission 
for Religious Relations with the Jews, headed by Cardinal 
Jorge Mejia, met for three days of meetings and dialogue 
October 17-19 near Rome.  Participants discussed \"A Common 
Vision of Social Justice and Ethical Behavior\" as part of 
an ongoing program established in 2002 between Catholic and 
Jewish authorities to find common ground on issues of 
mutual concern.  This year\'s session coincided with the 
30th anniversary of the establishment of the Holy See\'s 
Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Catholics, Jews are \"Unequivocal Partners\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (U) In a joint statement released after the conference 
(complete text emailed to EUR/WE and EUR/OHI) delegates 
said there was insufficient awareness in the Catholic and 
Jewish communities of \"the momentous change\" that has taken 
place in the relationship between the two peoples.  \"We are 
not enemies,\" the statement continued, \"but unequivocal 
partners in articulating the essential moral values for the 
survival and welfare of human society.\" 
 
4.  (U) The delegations also appealed for respect for 
Jerusalem\'s sacred character, as well as for the various 
religious communities in the Holy City.  The document 
encouraged religious authorities to \"protest publicly when 
actions of disrespect towards religious persons, symbols 
and Holy Sites are committed.\"  The six Catholic and six 
Jewish participants specifically mentioned the desecration 
of Jewish graves and an October 10 incident in which an 
ultra-Orthodox Jewish student spat at a cross carried by 
Armenian Orthodox Archbishop Nourhan Manougian during a 
religious procession in Jerusalem\'s Old City. 
 
------------------------------- 
Vatican Emphasizes Common Roots 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) In statements on Vatican Radio, Fr. Norbert 
Hofmann, Secretary of the Commission for Religious 
Relations with the Jews and a 2004 Embassy Vatican IVP 
recipient, said that in the wake of the Second Vatican 
Council in the 1960s, Catholics are discovering the Jewish 
roots of their faith.  \"Jesus was Jewish, the Mother of God 
was Jewish, the apostles were Jews,\" he said. \"Christianity 
has Jewish roots and we are increasingly rediscovering what 
we have in common.\" 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Pontifical University Focuses on Judaism 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
6.  (U) The Holy See\'s academic arms are also promoting 
dialogue with Judaism.  The Gregorian Pontifical University 
offers several courses on Jewish thought and relations in 
conjunction with the Cardinal Bea Center for Judaic 
Studie. The Center was formally founded in 2001, ut has 
origins dating to 1978.  This year, the Gregorian is 
offering a feature course opn to all Roman universities 
and to the public on the Catholic Church and Judaism \"from 
Vatican II to today.\"  In the first lecture -- held in 
conjunction with the Chief Rabbinate delegaton\'s visit -- 
German Cardinal Walter Kasper and Rome\'s Chief Rabbi, 
Ricardo Di Segni, analyzed the present state of Jewish- 
Catholic dialogue.  With Israel\'s Ambassador to the Holy 
See in attendance, both sides discussed challenges in 
relations, but concluded that significant progress had been 
made in recent years.  Rabbi Di Segni noted that 
involvement of the Orthodox rabbinical world in official 
dialogue with the Catholic Church \"would have been 
unthinkable only a few years ago.\"  Now it is a reality. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Further Holocaust Education a Possibility 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Topics to be addressed by scholars and leading 
churchmen during the course include the \"sometimes tragic\" 
story of Christian-Jewish relations before Vatican II, the 
effect of the Holocaust on inter-religious dialogue, and 
the state of Holy SeeIsrael relations.  Visiting EUR/OHI 
Deputy Director Don Braum discussed with Fr. Hofmann the 
possibility of a similar course or series of lectures 
focused exclusively on the Holocaust.  Though Hofmann is 
not on the permanent staff at the Gregorian, he thought the 
proposal would appeal to the directors of the program and 
to the Bea Center. 
 
------------------ 
Vatican Optimistic 
------------------ 
 
8.  (SBU) Hofmann was optimistic about Jewish-Catholic 
relations, citing a conference in Buenos Aires in July at 
which Catholic and Jewish participants performed community 
service projects together.  He said he was looking forward 
to an Anti-Defamation League meeting on anti-Semitism in 
Rome in December, and the next OSCE conference on the 
topic, to be held in Cordoba, Spain in 2005.  Braum briefed 
Hofmann on the activities of the Task Force for 
International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, 
Remembrance and Research, and raised the possibility of 
further opening the Vatican\'s archives for the period 
concerning the Holocaust. 
 
--------------------------- 
Sant\'Egidio Deeply Involved 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Braum also exchanged views with officials from 
the Vatican-affiliated Catholic lay organization 
Sant\'Egidio on anti-Semitism and Holocaust education.  In 
addition to Sant\'Egidio\'s annual peace conferences (ref a) 
that regularly feature panels on Jewish-Christian and 
Jewish-Muslim dialogue, the group sponsors a separate 
Jewish-Christian Dialogue Series that draws leaders from 
both traditions.  The next such event will be held in 
December or January.  Sant\'Egidio also incorporates its 
message of understanding into its work with the poor and 
immigrants in Rome.  Sant\'Egidio\'s officials told Braum and 
Poloff that a segment on Holocaust education has been 
introduced to its free Italian language classes for recent 
immigrants, many of whom are Muslim. 
 
--------------------------- 
Holocaust Remembrance March 
--------------------------- 
 
10.  (U) Sant\'Egidio organizes an annual march 
commemorating the expulsion of the Jews from Rome by the 
Nazis in 1943.  This year\'s event brought together the 
Catholic and Jewish communities, and included Muslim 
participants.  Several hundred people met at Sant\'Egidio\'s 
headquarters and, holding candles and carrying signs with 
the names of Nazi concentration camps, marched to Rome\'s 
Synagogue where they met members of the city\'s Jewish 
community.  Sant\'Egidio founder Andrea Riccardi, along with 
Rabbi Di Segni and other Jewish leaders, spoke of the need 
to recall the horror of the deportation and to pass on its 
 
 
lessons \"from generation to generation.\"  Members of Rome\'s 
Muslim community, including some recent Palestinian 
immigrants, also attended.  The event attracted 
considerable public attention, winding through the busy 
Rome streets on a Saturday night.  Sant\'Egidio 
representatives told us that each of its chapters worldwide 
(there are 40,000 members in some 60 countries) now holds 
an annual event to remember Holocaust victims. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (SBU) The Holy See\'s and Sant\'Egidio\'s expanding focus 
on Christian-Jewish dialogue, while not new for either, 
reflects each group\'s desire to combat signs of rising 
anti-Semitism and continue the positive evolution in 
religious dialogue since Vatican II in the 1960\'s.  Pope 
John Paul II has built on Vatican II-era breakthroughs in 
relations to forge new ties with Jews.  Using the Pope\'s 
focus on inter-religious dialogue of all types as a model, 
Sant\'Egidio has been extremely successful in bringing Jews, 
Christians and Muslims together in dialogue.  With 
significant overlap between the goals of these initiatives 
and those of the USG, meaningful opportunities exist for 
collaboration with the Vatican and Sant\'Egidio, including 
in the promotion of Holocaust education, increased 
attention to the root causes of the new anti-Semitism in 
Europe, and encouragement of the Vatican to open up more of 
its Holocaust-era archives to scholars.

Summary 
------- 
 
2.  (SBU) The Vatican Foreign Ministry,s director for the 
OSCE urged the U.S. November 18 to support the appointment of 
an OSCE Special Representative whose title would indicate a 
responsibility for monitoring discrimination and violence 
against Christians.  Noting that the first two 
representatives were concerned with anti-Semitism and 
anti-Islamic problems, he said the third representative in a 
proposed system of three officials should reflect that fact 
that Christians in Europe also faced discrimination.  This 
view, which the Vatican believes was reflected in the 
European Parliament\'s treatment of Italian European 
Commission nominee Rocco Buttiglione, has gained currency in 
recent months within the Holy See.  Post understands the USG 
does not support the inclusion of a reference to Christianity 
in the third representative,s title.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Holy See Unhappy with Proposal for Special Rep 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (SBU) Monsignor Ettore Ballestrero, the Vatican Foreign 
Ministry\'s Director for the OSCE, contacted Poloff November 
18 regarding proposed OSCE Special Representatives with 
responsibility for monitoring discrimination in OSCE 
countries.  Ballestrero expressed support for the proposal to 
appoint one representative to monitor anti-Semitism and 
another to monitor discrimination against Muslims.  However, 
he said the Holy See was unhappy with the plans for a the 
third representative, which he understood was now defined as 
a monitor of racism, xenophobia, and more general instances 
of discrimination. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Anti-Christian Problems Need Specific Attention 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  (SBU) Ballestrero said that discrimination and other 
problems related to the Christian community in OSCE countries 
needed to be addressed specifically by this system of special 
representatives.  For the Holy See, this means not simply 
including a reference to Christianity in the mandate of the 
third representative, but including a reference to 
anti-Christian attitudes or actions in his or her title. 
While the Vatican acknowledges the seriousness of 
anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic problems in OSCE countries, it 
maintains that anti-Christianity is also a problem and 
deserves equal attention.  \"It,s a question of fairness and 
balance,\" Ballestrero said.  He cited examples of 
anti-Christian problems in Europe, including recent vandalism 
of churches of various Christian denominations in the 
Netherlands.  \"This isn,t just about Catholics,\" Ballestrero 
stressed.  He said the Vatican felt a responsibility to speak 
on behalf of all Christians in the region. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Increasing Concern from the Vatican 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) The Holy See has had concerns about problems facing 
Christians in Europe for some time, but recent events, 
including the high-profile rejection of EU 
Commissioner-designate Rocco Buttiglione for his Catholic 
views on social issues, have intensified their concerns. 
(Buttiglione is generally considered to be an intimate of 
Pope John Paul II.)  Often-outspoken Cardinal Renato Martino, 
former Holy See UN Permanent Observer and current President 
of the PonQifical Council for Justice and Peace, was widelQ 
quoted in the press at the time of the Buttiglione 
controversy, condemning the \"nasty\" tone of the \"lay 
inquisition\" that he believed was fomenting a \"new 
anti-Catholicism\" in Europe.  Other Vatican officials have 
warned recently of a \"lay fundamentalism\" and \"aggressive 
laicism\" in Spain.  Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal 
Angelo Sodano told the media that it wasn\'t the first time 
that \"Catholics (found) themselves confronted with...the 
dangers of isolation and discrimination.  Just look at the 
history of the Christian church.\"  Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, 
Prefect of the Vatican\'s Congregation for the Doctrine of the 
Faith, added to the Holy See\'s offensive on the subject when 
he told Italian center-left daily La Repubblica November 19 
that speaking about God in today\'s public sphere had become 
\"indecent.\" 
 
 
---------------------------- 
USG Position: Action Request 
---------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Poloff spoke with USOSCE and understands that the 
USG is against specific mention of Christianity in the 
representative,s title.  Post understands USG concerns to be 
that an attempt to \"balance\" the system of representatives by 
adding a reference to Christianity to the title of the third 
official would send the wrong message about the seriousness 
of the effort and its motivation.  Indeed such an inclusion 
might minimize the gravity of anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim 
problems, which the USG regards as more serious than 
discrimination or violence against Christians.  Further, once 
these three world religions were mentioned in the titles of 
representatives, there might be further pressure to add 
references to still more religions.  Post requests further 
guidance to respond to the Holy See\'s concerns.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Holy See Deputy Foreign Minister Pietro Parolin 
told the Ambassador November 26 that the Vatican intended 
to continue pressing to add a reference to Christianity in 
the title of the proposed OSCE Special Representative on 
Tolerance and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and 
Discrimination.  Ambassador delivered ref (a) points, 
emphasizing that including anti-Christian discrimination in 
the representative\'s mandate would ensure sufficient 
attention to the problem.  Parolin and OSCE Director 
Balestrero, however, affirmed the Vatican\'s support for a 
title with \"a Particular Focus on Discriminationagainst 
Christians,\" rejecting even the possiQility of a title 
\"Including Discrimination ag!inst Christians.\"  Although 
Parolin said the Vatican \"would always consider all 
proposals,\" the Holy See feels that this is an issue on 
which it has to remain firm.  End Summary.

to a \"Particular Focus nst

Balester`d in ref (b), stressingy the serious nature of anti-Semitic 
and anti-Islamic problems in the OSCE region, only that 
there needed to be a focus on anti-Christian issues as 
well. 
 
------------------------------- 
Ambassador Presses USG Position 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) The Ambassador emphasized the points in ref (a), 
noting that adding Christianity to the representative\'s 
title could open the floodgates to group after group 
wanting similar inclusion.  This could water down or render 
ineffective the entire endeavor, he said.  The Ambassador 
pointed out that even if other groups did not jump on 
board, adding Christianity to the representative\'s title 
would imply that there are only three religions in the 
region deserving of OSCE attention, to say nothing of other 
non-religious groups.  Including a reference to anti- 
Christian discrimination in the representative\'s mandate, 
the Ambassador concluded, would ensure that the problem 
receives appropriate attention. 
 
------------------- 
Vatican Unrelenting 
------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Parolin and Balestero remained firm on their 
points, with Balestrero becoming animated when speaking 
about the issue of balance and fairness.  There are some 
smaller groups that could complain about not being included 
in the representative\'s title, Balestrero said.  \"But we\'re 
talking about Europe,\" where Christians make up a great 
percentage of the population.  \"If you\'re going to leave 
out a group that is facing discrimination, how can it be 
Christians,\" he asked.  Balestrero noted that the Holy See 
remained in the background on many OSCE issues, realizing 
that on defense matters, for example, other delegations had 
more expertise r greater equities than the Vatican.  But 
he insisted that the Holy See had to assert itself on a 
religious and human rights issue such as this.  Otherwise, 
he implied, what was the point of its OSCE membership? 
 
------------------------- 
Searching for Flexibility 
 
 
------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) While making clear that he was not negotiating 
the proposal\'s wording, the Ambassador probed the Holy 
See\'s flexibility on the issue, asking if, for example, the 
Vatican would accept a title \"Including Discrimination 
against Christians.\"  Balestrero flatly rejected the idea. 
Parolin, while initially backing up his colleague\'s view, 
added that the Holy See \"would, of course, consider all 
proposals.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU) The Holy See appeared unaware on the 26th of the 
possibility of EU movement in its direction as discussed 
with OSCE Vienna (ref c).  We expect that the Vatican would 
become further emboldened if it saw support for its 
position growing within the EU.  The fact that the normally 
reticent Vatican is pressing this issue so vigorously 
reflects the depth of its concern about what it perceives 
to be growing anti-Christian discrimination in Europe, as 
reflected in recent events including the rejection by the 
EU parliament of the Italian candidate for the EU 
Commission (ref b).

SUBJECT:  WORLD AIDS DAY:  VATICAN CALLS FOR TOTAL CARE 
 
Ref: a) 03 Vatican 3971; b) 03 Vatican 5427; c) Vatican 
 
1389 
 
1. The Vatican has called for total care and services for 
persons with HIV/AIDS in its 2004 message for World AIDS 
Day.  The message, from the head of the Vatican\'s Council 
for Health Care issues, Cardinal Javier Lozano Barragan, 
reports that the Catholic Church provides almost 27 percent 
of care worldwide to persons with HIV/AIDS.  This includes 
care given in clinics and hospices, as well as treatment 
and prevention programs (reftels).  Cardinal Barragan 
called for an end to the stigma that \"so often makes 
society harsh in relation to the AIDS victim\" and then 
pointed out that HIV infection can occur through blood 
transfusions, mother-child transmission, and sexual 
contact. 
 
2.QCardinal Barragan urged effective measures to combat 
virus transmission, including responsible behavior, the 
\"virtue of chastity\" and marital fidelity.  He said 
policies to combat HIV/AIDS should include support for 
social and economic stability, economic solidarity from 
industrialized nations for poorer countries, reduction of 
the cost of anti-retroviral treatments, and information 
campaigns focused on mother-child transmission.  He called 
for expanded care for HIV-positive infants and AIDS 
orphans, and for the elimination of discrimination against 
persons with HIV/AIDS.  The Cardinal said his department 
was working closely with African bishops at the express 
wish of Pope John Paul II to confront the pandemic on that 
continent.  Barragan has also created a coordination 
mechanism within his Council to facilitate requests for 
assistance and funding from smaller Catholic entities 
working on HIV/AIDS care, prevention, and treatment. 
 
3. Comment:  The Holy See remains an increasingly 
committed partner in global efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, and 
is devoting increasing personnel and resources to support 
international prevention and treatment efforts.  Its reach 
and influence in the developing world make it a key partner 
for education and prevention campaigns, particularly in 
implementing elements \"A\" and \"B\" of the Administration\'s 
\"A-B-C\"(Abstain, Be faithful, Use Condoms) policy to combat 
the pandemic.  End Comment.

of the interim Iraqi government to visit the Pope - 
following on the heels of PM Allawi\'s November visit.  The 
Holy See will continue to lobby hard for guarantees for 
religious freedom in the new Iraq while promising the 
active cooperation of the Vatican and local Catholic 
communities in reconstruction and stabilization efforts.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Holy See Foreign Minister Lajolo agreed with NEA A/S 
Burns December 9 that there were signs of \"a better 
situation\" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and he 
emphasized that \"both sides\" now needed to move forward with 
the Road Map.  On Iraq elections, Lajolo welcomed Burns\' 
assurance that they would be held as scheduled, and was 
unfazed by his caveat that they would not be flawless. 
Lajolo said elections did not have to be perfect as long as 
they created an adequate sense of legitimacy for the new 
government among Iraqis.  Lajolo was interested in Burns\' 
assessment of the security situation in Iraq, and appreciated 
the Assistant Secretary\'s assurances of continued USG 
attention to the plight of Christians there.  Burns also 
reviewed current USG thinking on Syria, Iran, and Libya.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------- 
Signs of Hope 
------------- 
 
2. (C) Holy See Foreign Minister equivalent Archbishop 
Giovanni Lajolo concurred with NEA Assistant Secretary 
William Burns\' assessment in a December 9 meeting at the 
Vatican that there were signs of \"a better situation\" in the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Lajolo emphasized that renewed 
commitment was now needed from \"both sides\" to reinvigorate 
the Road Map.  According to Lajolo, Arafat\'s exit from the 
scene gave the Palestinians an opportunity for \"more active 
engagement\" against terrorism.  The Israelis, for their part, 
needed to be more committed to maintaining peace and should 
go out of their way to avoid provocations, Lajolo maintained. 
 
----------------------- 
Equal Treatment Crucial 
----------------------- 
 
3. (C) A/S Burns emphasized President Bush\'s commitment to 
progress in resolving the conflict and his determination to 
move forward despite continuing challenges.  Lajolo 
underlined the need for the USG to appear even-handed in 
brokering the dispute.  \"The impression of equal treatment\" 
of the Israelis and Palestinians is crucial, he said.  Burns 
noted that the more the Palestinians acted against terrorism, 
the better the USG could work with Israel on freedom of 
movement issues, settlement activity, and other Palestinian 
concerns. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Iraq:  Elections Don\'t Need to be Perfect 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Turning to Iraq, Burns told Lajolo that Iraqi 
elections would be held as scheduled in January, but 
cautioned that the process would not be flawless.  Lajolo was 
unfazed.  \"They don\'t have to be perfect,\" he said, as long 
as they create a sense of legitimacy for the government among 
Iraqis.  Burns noted continuing security challenges, and 
recounted his recent meeting in Baghdad with various 
Christian leaders.  He assured Lajolo of continued U.S. 
attention to the plight of Christians there, and said that 
Ambassador Negroponte\'s door has been and will remain open to 
Iraq Christian groups.  Lajolo acknowledged the Vatican\'s 
continued preoccupation with security for the Christian 
community, and its longer-term concern about the exodus of 
Christians from Iraq.  Noting that there had been another 
bombing of a Catholic Church the day before in Mosul, Lajolo 
said he appreciated USG efforts to give continuing priority 
to the issue. 
 
5. (C) Lajolo noted that PM Allawi had seemed optimistic 
about security issues during their November Vatican meeting. 
\"I don\'t know how he could be,\" Lajolo quipped, but he 
suggested that with Iraqis comprising such a large number of 
victims of the terrorist attacks, a backlash against the 
insurgents could grow in time.  Burns agreed, and said he had 
seen evidence of a backlash, at least against foreign 
insurgents. 
 
--------------- 
 
Regional Issues 
--------------- 
 
6. (C) As in his previous meeting with A/S Burns (ref a), 
Lajolo raised the Holy See\'s interest in the roles of Syria 
and Iran in the region.  Burns explained the USG\'s security 
concerns on the Syrian-Iraqi border and on support for 
insurgents in Iraq from Iraqi Baathists in Damascus.  Lajolo 
was also interested in Burns\' current take on Syria\'s 
influence on Lebanon.  On Iran, Lajolo seemed unconvinced 
about the nuclear danger posed by the regime.  Burns said 
there was ample evidence of Iran\'s nuclear ambitions, and 
pointed to its lack of honesty with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA).  He emphasized, however, that the U.S. 
was committed to diplomatic means to resolve the situation. 
Lajolo expressed hope that the student population in Iran and 
the power of the internet might help to bring about change. 
Burns acknowledged both the potential and the limitations of 
these factors, and said the prospects for imminent change 
were not great.  On Libya, Lajolo mentioned rumors of 
Ghadafi\'s intent to install his son as a successor, and noted 
recent travel to that country by many Italians. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The Middle East remains the region of priority concern 
for the Holy See, which continues to regard the 
Israel-Palestinian divide as the \'mother of all conflicts\' in 
the region and an ongoing fuel for terrorism.  The Vatican\'s 
concerns about the exodus of Christians from Iraq mirror a 
larger concern about the demise of historic Christian 
communities throughout the region which one member of the 
Curia recently suggested to us would leave the whole region 
virtually devoid of Christian communities in a generation or 
two.  Archbishop Lajolo, accompanied by 2005 IVP awardee and 
Regional Director for the Middle East Monsignor Franco 
Coppola, clearly appreciated the chance to hear A/S Burns\' 
perspective on the full range of issues in the region. 
 
8.  (U) A/S Burns has cleared this message. 
 
9.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered.

SUBJECT: VATICAN REJECTS PACIFISM, BUT DEBATE SIMMERS 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) Contrary to the popular perception of a pacifist 
Vatican generated by the Holy See\'s opposition to the Iraq 
war, senior Vatican officials have consistently 
acknowledged the legitimacy of war as a last resort and 
have recently gone out of their way to make clear that the 
Holy See is not pacifist.  The Holy See\'s Permanent 
Observer at the UN in Geneva cited the obligation to disarm 
the aggressor when the human rights of citizens are under 
threat.  Likewise, speaking at a Catholic Social week in 
Camaguey, Cuba, Bishop Giampaolo Crepaldi of the Pontifical 
Council for Justice and Peace warned against the excesses 
of pacifism.  Crepaldi\'s comments reinforced private 
reassurances the Embassy has received from senior officials 
that the Vatican continues to adhere to its traditional 
doctrine on war and peace issues:  that war is a 
regrettable but sometimes necessary aspect of human 
existence.  There is no doubt that the Holy See and the 
Pope himself oppose war.  But the Vatican\'s well-known 
preference for peace can make its voice all the more 
important when it does conclude that military action is 
justified.  End summary. 
 
------------------ 
Rejecting Pacifism 
------------------ 
 
2. (U) Affirming the realism reflected in many Papal 
statements and official Church doctrine, the Vatican\'s 
Secretary for the Council of Justice and Peace restated the 
 
SIPDIS 
Holy See\'s rejection of pacifism as a utopian response to 
war and violence.  Speaking at a Catholic Social week in 
Camaguey, Cuba, Bishop Giampaolo Crepaldi said that 
pacifism, while generally a positive good, runs the risk of 
overstatement.  Crepaldi, the number two in the Council, 
implied that a total rejection of all forms of violence 
would be neither helpful nor realistic in today\'s world. 
He pointed out that Pope John Paul II could never be called 
a pacifist.  As proof, he noted the Pope\'s call for 
humanitarian intervention during the Balkan wars, his 
consistent appreciation of the sacrifice and valor of those 
killed in defense of their homelands, and the fact that he 
has never condemned wars \"in a single sense.\" 
 
3.(U) The Holy See\'s Permanent Observer to the UN in 
Geneva, Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, delivered a similar 
message recently, citing Pope John Paul\'s Message for the 
2000 World Day of Peace.  In this message the Pope 
addressed the issue of \"humanitarian intervention,\" 
observing:  \"Clearly, when a civilian population risks 
being overcome by the attacks of an unjust aggressor and 
political efforts and non-violent defense prove to be of no 
avail, it is legitimate and even obligatory to take 
concrete measures to disarm the aggressor.  These measures 
however must be limited in time and precise in their aims. 
They must be carried out in full respect for international 
law, guaranteed by an authority that is internationally 
recognized and, in any event, never left to the outcome of 
armed intervention alone.\" 
 
------------------------------ 
Pope John Paul II: No Pacifist 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) The comments by Tomasi and Crepaldi come at a time 
when some in the Church have sought to advance the view 
that war in today\'s world can no longer be considered just. 
Such a view, however, goes well beyond the Pope\'s thinking, 
and it is likely that Crepaldi\'s comments, which would have 
been cleared internally, were aimed at setting the record 
straight.  Certainly, the Pope rejects war as a tool of 
international policymaking.  On December 16, in fact, in an 
address to new ambassadors, he lamented the continuing 
presence of the \"scourge of war\" and reiterated his appeal 
\"to all men and women of good will to definitively lay down 
arms and to commit themselves to...dialogue.\"  The Pope 
emphasized that \"violence never serves the cause of 
peoples, nor their development.\"  However, both he and the 
Holy See\'s traditional just war doctrine have consistently 
recognized that when faced with violence, civilized peoples 
sometimes have no choice but to face the last resort of 
responding in kind.  In the period immediately preceding 
the 2003 military action against Saddam Hussein\'s Iraq, the 
Vatican\'s Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, as 
well as official papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls, 
were at pains to stress that Pope John Paul II and the Holy 
See were not pacifists, but rather peacemakers. 
 
5. (SBU) More recently, the Pope has affirmed that states 
have the obligation to defend themselves against terrorism. 
 
In his Message for the 2004 World Day of Peace he spoke of 
\"the necessary fight against terrorism\" and acknowledged 
the potential necessity of the use of force for \"repressive 
and punitive operations.\"  Similarly, the Pontiff\'s calls 
to \"disarm the aggressor\" at the time of the conflicts in 
Bosnia, Kosovo, and later in East Timor hardly reflect the 
sentiments of a pacifist.  The position of the Catholic 
Church documented officially in its catechism is clear, 
regarding war as a regrettable but sometimes necessary 
aspect of human existence.  Catholic doctrine upholds the 
right to self-defense for individuals and nations. 
Citizens are required to participate in the defense of 
their nation in wartime.  Members of the military are 
described as \"servants of security and freedom of nations.\" 
 
------------------------------- 
Prelates Pushing Anti-War Views 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Ironically, Crepaldi\'s comments will be seen by many 
as at cross-purposes with the views of his boss, Justice 
and Peace Council President, Cardinal Renato Martino, who 
recently asserted that war constituted a modern evil 
\"infinitely greater than the eventual goods\" it can procure 
for the victors.  Martino, who tends to offer his personal 
views in his frequent contacts with the media, added that 
war had become ever more absurd and intolerable because of 
the increased destructive power of weapons.  He also 
condemned what he termed the human and economic costs of 
war.  Martino said it was a fundamental ethical imperative 
to put an end once and for all to war, which he described 
as \"pre-human.\" 
 
----------------------------- 
Battle Over Pacifism Not over 
----------------------------- 
 
7.(SBU) Although the Pope\'s view is clear to members of 
the Curia, this will not likely put an end to debate within 
the Holy see about the proper role of warfare in the modern 
world.   Members of the Vatican hierarchy do not hesitate 
to speak their minds on political issues -- as opposed to 
theological issues where the Pope\'s word is law.  As a 
result, the public perception of the Holy See\'s position on 
war and peace is likely to remain clouded by ongoing 
freelancing by senior Vatican officials.  Such freelancing 
is tantamount to U.S. Cabinet officers giving their 
independent opinions on U.S. policy issues, and will 
continue to feed the media\'s penchant for emphasizing 
statements by cardinals or other Curia members at variance 
with traditional doctrines.  Thus, even as the Pope 
reaffirms his rejection of pacifism, contrary views will 
continue to be publicly aired. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.(U) The Pope\'s opposition to the war in Iraq left a 
widespread impression of a Vatican opposed to war at all 
costs, even though the Pope\'s opposition at the time 
carried careful caveats and ultimately recognized the right 
of legitimately-elected governments to make prudential 
judgments about war.  Church leaders with more absolute 
anti-war views have sought to take advantage of the Pope\'s 
opposition to the Iraq war to build support for a shift in 
the Church\'s doctrine toward a complete condemnation of all 
war.  While this struggle will continue, the Holy See\'s 
practice on war and peace issues will more likely reflect 
the realism -- rooted in centuries of diplomatic activism 
on the world stage -- that led it to approve of the U.S. 
action in Afghanistan and to calls for humanitarian 
intervention to ward off greater loss of life in Timor and 
Kosovo.  Likewise, the Vatican\'s abhorrence of religiously- 
inspired terrorism -- violence the Pope has described as 
\"an act of blasphemy and a perversion of religion\" -- will 
spur it to remain a strong partner in the war on terror. 
In fact, its well-known preference for peace makes its 
voice all the more important when it does conclude that 
military action, whether against terror or to resolve a 
humanitarian catastrophe, is justified.

SUBJECT:  EMBASSY CONFERENCE PROMOTES RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS 
CENTRAL ELEMENT OF U.S. POLICY 
 
REFS: Vatican 4517; Vatican 4441 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.Post\'s final conference in a series marking the 
twentieth anniversary of diplomatic relations with the Holy 
See promoted religious freedom as a core goal of U.S. 
foreign policy.  An ensemble of high-level Vatican and USG 
officials, along with academics and NGO experts, offered a 
comprehensive overview of the importance of religious 
freedom to democracy and civil society, the challenges to 
religious freedom, and an assessment of what can be done to 
address these challenges.  Ambassador-at-Large for 
International Religious Freedom John Hanford described U.S. 
efforts to combat and monitor freedom of religion, 
highlighting the role of the State Department\'s Annual 
Report on International Religious Freedom.  The Holy See\'s 
Foreign Minister equivalent, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, 
reviewed the Vatican\'s diplomatic activity on behalf of 
religious freedom, emphasizing the central importance of 
religious freedom to the life of the Catholic Church.  All 
speakers agreed that religious liberty was essential for 
enhanced international cooperation and security, and agreed 
that much needed to be done in this area.  Speakers agreed 
that governments, NGOs and religious authorities needed to 
work together to expand such freedom worldwide.  The 
program generated extensive international and Italian media 
coverage.  End Summary.

U.S. LEADS GLOBAL DRIVE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2.Opening the Embassy-organized conference, \"Religious 
Freedom:  Cornerstone of Human Dignity,\" Ambassador 
Nicholson emphasized U.S. leadership in promoting and 
defending religious freedom throughout the world. 
Observing that the desire for religious liberty was the 
driving force for the establishment of the first American 
colonies, the Ambassador noted that it has been a central 
tenet of American life from our foundation.  Religious 
liberty, he pointed out, was closely linked to world peace 
and stability, for where religious liberty was not 
respected, and where religious tolerance and respect for 
the rights of others were not common, conflict and violence 
often ensued.  The Ambassador outlined U.S. initiatives to 
monitor and combat violations against religious freedom, 
including the work of U.S. embassies, the 1998 Religious 
Freedom Act, and the establishment of the State 
Department\'s Ambassador-at-Large for International 
Religious Freedom.  Nicholson highlighted the convergence 
of U.S. and Holy See objectives on religious freedom - 
which President Bush has described as a \"fundamental 
freedom\" and Pope John Paul II has termed the \"basis of all 
other freedoms.\" 
 
3.Pointing out that over half the world\'s population 
lives under governments that restrict religious freedom, 
U.S. Ambassador-at-large for International Religious 
Freedom John Hanford outlined U.S. efforts to combat and 
monitor freedom.  While citing progress in Afghanistan, 
Iraq, Turkmenistan, and India, Hanford detailed continuing 
problems in countries of particular concern including Saudi 
Arabia, Iran, North Korea, Burma, China, Vietnam, Eritrea 
and Sudan.  Ambassador Hanford emphasized that religious 
freedom was a personal priority for President Bush, who 
frequently raises U.S. concerns directly with foreign 
n 
leaders.  Turning to Iraq where Chaldean Catholic Churches 
have come under attack, Hanford affirmed USG concern about 
new threats against Christians in Iraq and about the 
resulting Christian exodus from the country.  Religious 
extremism, according to the Ambassador, represented a major 
threat to the international order, as extremists have come 
to believe that religion demands the death of innocents and 
the destruction of liberty.  He said that the U.S. holds 
confidently to the idea that expanded respect for religious 
freedom will ultimately cultivate greater respect for human 
 
 
dignity.  Ambassador Hanford concluded with a strong 
message for those suffering religious persecution around 
the world:  \"We will not forget them, and we will never 
abandon their cause.\" 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
HOLY SEE\'S RAISON D\'ETRE  RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4.Holy See FM Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, noting \"the 
e 
importance of religious freedom for the very life of the 
Church,\" observed that the Holy See has always placed 
priority on religious liberty as the most fundamental human 
right.  To promote favorable conditions for believers 
everywhere, Vatican diplomacy has engaged both bilaterally 
and multilaterally.  In its bilateral dealings, the Vatican 
has pursued \"concordat diplomacy\" to allow the Catholic 
Church to operate freely within a particular country, while 
cooperating with national governments as a positive social 
agent.  In this regard, Lajolo pointed out that bilateral 
agreements made by the Holy See with certain countries have 
often led to similar arrangements for other religious 
denominations.  For example, the Holy See\'s 1984 Concordat 
with Italy, preceded a similar pact that same year between 
Italy and the Waldensian Church. 
 
5.On the multilateral level, Lajolo said that the Holy 
See participates actively in UN Third Committee debates in 
New York and in Geneva at the UN Commission on Human 
Rights.  He said the Holy See supports expanded cooperation 
between the UN and world religions, as proposed recently by 
the Philippines, as long as such cooperation does not 
interfere with inter-religious dialogue, which the Holy See 
considers to be the competence of religious authorities. 
Lajolo also recalled the Holy See\'s central role in 
ensuring the inclusion of religious freedom in the 
\"decalogue\" of human rights that OSCE states committed 
themselves to uphold, and then of obtaining an expansive 
description of the content of religious freedom. 
 
6.  Assessing the challenges to religious freedom today, 
Lajolo observed that the war against terrorism, while 
necessary, has had as a side effect \"the spread of 
\'Christianophobia\' in vast areas of the globe\" where 
Western civilization and western policies \"are considered 
to be determined by Christianity, or at least not separated 
from it.\"  In Western societies themselves, Lajolo 
cautioned against neglect of the \"public dimension of 
religious freedom,\" which would encompass a healthy 
dialogue between church and state.  In other areas of the 
world, Lajolo lamented restrictions the right of religions 
to organize freely and criticized regimes that created 
difficult conditions for the registration of religious 
communities or imposed penalties for religious conversion. 
On the margins of the Conference, Lajolo called attention 
to the Vatican\'s recent efforts to place anti-Christianity 
on the UN and OSCE human rights agenda - a point that 
Embassy and the Holy See have recently discussed in depth 
(reftels). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Religious Freedom as Foundation for International Order 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
7.Seamus Hasson, Founder and President of the Beckett 
Fund for Religious Liberty, offered Conference delegates a 
compelling argument of how in the American tradition 
religious liberty has been regarded as a \"human right that 
t 
no government grants in the first place and therefore no 
government may properly deny.\"  Religious freedom, says 
Hasson, follows from human nature itself.  Hasson recalled 
James Madison\'s views on religious liberty in which 
everyone had the freedom to embrace, profess and observe 
the religion \"which we believe to be of divine origin.\" 
Madison\'s hesitancy over enshrining religious freedom in 
law revealed his fear that the inalienable nature of the 
right would somehow be compromised.  Hasson noted that 
Madison consistently maintained that the national right of 
 
 
religious freedom was broader than that enshrined in the 
Constitution.  He went on to attribute much of the 
confusion over religious liberty in present-day America to 
the confusion between natural rights and legal rights. 
When presented examples of abuses of religious freedom 
based on legal systems, Hasson suggested most Americans 
would \"continue to follow in the trajectory of our 
founding:  religious liberty is a human right that no 
government grants in the first place and therefore no 
government may properly deny.\" 
 
8.Notre Dame University Law School Professor Paolo 
Carozza, argued that religious freedom was not merely a 
requirement of respecting individual human dignity, but 
also a requirement for peace, security and cooperation 
among nations.  It would be a grave mistake, said Carozza, 
for international politics and law to exclude or ignore 
religion, because, for huge segments of the human race, 
religious communities and religious traditions are the 
primary context for \"wrestling with the meaning of 
reality.\"  While this religious dimension could not be 
ignored, Carozza cautioned that not all expressions of 
religion manifest openness to a universal common good; and 
that this poses a significant challenge for international 
law and politics.  In this regard, Carozza called for a 
\"very robust understanding of religious freedom\" in order 
to avoid naivety about its potential dangers. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
NGOs:  KEEPERS OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FLAME 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
9.The Institute on Religion and Public Policy\'s Joseph 
Grieboski delivered an impassioned apology for the role of 
NGOs to promote and defend religious freedom, which he 
described as foundational:  \"Without freedom of religion 
and belief, there is no freedom of speech, as believers 
cannot communicate publicly their most fundamental beliefs; 
there is no freedom of the press, as believers cannot print 
and share their beliefs with others; and there is no 
freedom of assembly, as like-minded believers cannot meet 
to share their beliefs and worship their Creator according 
to the dictates of their minds, hearts, and consciences.\" 
Grieboski pointed out that NGOs in the religious freedom 
advocacy field play an important role in gathering 
information, disseminating information to policymakers, 
religious leaders, other NGOs, and the general public, and 
shaping policy to advance the cause of religious freedom. 
Grieboski argued convincingly that a government\'s guarantee 
of freedom of religion indicates acceptance of the premise 
of democracy:  that every individual has value and worth, 
and that the state is constituted to serve society, not 
vice versa.  In this sense, he concluded, freedom of 
religion serves as the cornerstone of democracy. 
 
10.Attilio Tamburrini, Director of the Italian section of 
Aid to the Church in Need, outlined his NGO\'s work in 
assisting persecuted Christians and reporting instances of 
religious freedom violations around the world. 
Tamburrini\'s organization has official status at the Holy 
See and works out of Vatican offices.  Since 1998, Aid to 
the Church in Need has published an annual report on 
religious freedom around the world.  Tamburrini\'s 
presentation highlighted what he described as an urgent 
need to stimulate the public consciousness on religious 
freedom issues.  Noting the media success of the launch of 
this year\'s edition of his organization\'s report, 
Tamburrini lamented the lack of media coverage of religious 
freedom issues throughout the rest of the year - which he 
attributed to a \"cultural hostility towards religious 
issues.\"  Nonetheless, he praised the work of Ambassador 
Hanford and the Embassy\'s initiative in organizing the 
conference, hoping that such initiatives would multiply, 
and in particular stimulating academic and governmental 
interest in religious freedom issues.  He noted that the 
Italian government had held its first ever parliamentary 
hearings on the subject only within the past year.

China, Holy Land, Nigeria: Regional Perspectives 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
11.To rounding off the Conference, panelists Bernardo 
Cervellero, David Maria Jaeger and Dan Madigan looked at 
three regions of religious freedom concern.  Cervellero a 
China expert and a member of the Pontifical Institute for 
r 
Foreign Missions,  urged that the current wave of political 
and economic engagement with China be tempered  by a 
recognition of the appalling religious freedom situation in 
the communist state.  While there had been some cosmetic 
changes in regard to religious freedom, Cervellera pointed 
to a recent Party document outlining plans to \"promote 
atheism and ban religions and superstitions.\"  He said 
Chinese authorities saw religious freedom purely as a 
legislative concession by the State and not as a 
fundamental human right. 
 
12. Franciscan Father David Maria Jaeger lauded USG 
support for on-going diplomatic negotiations between the 
Vatican and Israel aimed at regularizing the position of 
the Catholic Church in the Holy Lands.  Jaeger is a member 
of the Vatican delegation negotiating with Israeli 
authorities on elements of the Fundamental Agreement 
established between the two States in 1994.  The Franciscan 
priest formerly served as a senior member of the Vatican\'s 
Custody of the Holy Land, responsible for maintaining 
Christian holy sites, and the care of pilgrims and resident 
Christians.  He urged Middle Eastern states to recognize 
and adopt international standards of freedom of religion 
and conscience, \"assuring their citizens, and all others, 
of complete civic equality.\"  Jaeger noted the significance 
of Israel and the Palestinian Authority being the first in 
the region to sign agreements with the Vatican guaranteeing 
religious freedom, given the Vatican\'s interest in the 
plight of Christians in the Holy Land. 
 
13.Jesuit Dan Madigan told the Conference that many 
conflicts that seem to have a religious root are, in fact, 
conflicts in which religious differences are manipulated to 
protect economic or political power.  He cited Nigeria as a 
key example.  Madigan said the global political situation 
is often played out on the local level, with some Christian 
communities suffering because of what some Muslims see as a 
global Christian and Western offensive against Islam. 
Madigan called for a comprehensive approach to human 
rights, saying that if religious freedom was foundational, 
then its defenders should also work to promote the other 
rights inherent to human dignity.  (Note: Madigan runs the 
Gregorian University\'s Institute for Culture and Religion, 
and trains future Catholic leaders and students from other 
religious traditions in issues related to inter-religious 
dialogue and religious freedom.  End note). 
 
------------------------ 
Extensive Media Coverage 
------------------------ 
 
14.The Conference garnered extensive media coverage in 
international, Catholic, and Italian  media.  The Italian 
Catholic daily Avvenire devoted a full page to the 
conference under the headline  \"Religious Liberty is at 
Risk Everywhere.\" Other Italian media coverage included 
leading dailies Corriere della Sera and Il Tempo and the 
national news wire service ANSA, which issued three stories 
highlighting challenges to religious freedom.  Coverage 
also included a pre-conference live interview with 
Ambassadors Nicholson and Hanford on Vatican Radio, which 
boasts an international audience of tens of thousands of 
listeners in 40 languages.  The National Catholic 
Reporter\'s \"Word from Rome, with a global Catholic 
audience,\" ran extensive excerpts of remarks made by Lajolo 
and Hanford.  A pre-conference Q&A with Ambassador 
Nicholson in the international ZENIT News Service -- 
distributed in the English, Italian and Spanish versions -- 
previewed key aspects of the conference, while ZENIT\'s 
Italian version also ran an extensive pre-conference 
interview with Ambassador Hanford.  Other news service 
coverage included REUTERS, Vatican Information Service 
 
 
(VIS), Catholic News Service (CNS) and AsiaNews. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
15. The Embassy\'s conference on religious freedom drew a 
large audience -- over 250 -- and extensive media coverage, 
reflecting the growing interest in the subject of religious 
freedom as a \"cornerstone\" of human dignity and of a more 
secure international order.  The Conference resonated 
strongly with the Holy See, whose Prime Minister 
equivalent, Cardinal Sodano, took a personal interest in 
ensuring high-level Vatican participation.  Indeed, the 
participation of Foreign Minister Lajolo made clear the 
importance the Holy See attaches to this issue.  By 
bringing together the USG\'s Ambassador for Religious 
Freedom with the Vatican\'s FM, the Conference served to 
highlight the commonality of U.S. and Holy See views and 
establish some directions for future action to expand the 
reach of religious freedom where it is under threat. 
Embassy greatly appreciates the participation of the U.S. 
Ambassador for Religious Freedom, who was able to convey 
effectively to a diverse international audience the depth 
of the U.S. commitment to greater religious freedom for all 
believers.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C)  Iraqi Ambassador to the Holy See Edward Ismail Yelda 
called for tighter controls on his country\'s borders in a 
December 16 meeting with the Ambassador.  He urged particular 
attention to the Jordanian border, which he cited as a source 
of foreign fighters and weapons.  Yelda said the situation in 
Iraq called for more coalition troops, and also advised more 
comprehensive training and more careful screening of Iraqi 
security forces.  Yelda described the ongoing security 
concerns affecting Iraq\'s Christian community, asserting that 
Baathists seeking to build support for a return to the old 
regime were primarily responsible for the attacks on 
Christians.  Yelda said coalition and Iraqi forces needed to 
be more aggressive against the insurgents, as they had been 
in Fallujah.  Yelda thanked the Ambassador warmly for the 
U.S. intervention in Iraq, and said the U.S. would be needed 
there for some time to come.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Watch the Border with Jordan 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Iraq\'s new Ambassador to the Holy See, Edward Ismail 
Yelda, called for tighter controls on his country\'s borders 
in a December 16 courtesy call on the Ambassador.  Yelda 
noted that Iraq\'s borders with Iran and Syria needed to be 
tightened, but became animated as he turned to Jordan.  \"No 
one will talk about this problem because of political 
considerations,\" he said, \"but there are many evil people in 
Jordan\" who are undermining Iraqi security.  He claimed that 
the Jordanian border was loose, due to border guards 
accepting bribes on both sides.  He worried about the \"many 
trucks\" that cross into Iraq, apparently uninspected.  Jordan 
and other countries, Yelda declared, had yet to \"get the 
message\" about halting the flow of terrorists, arms and money 
into Iraq. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
More Coalition Forces, More Training for Iraqis Needed 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  (C)  Ambassador Yelda also called for more coalition 
forces in Iraq.  Aside from their obvious help in maintaining 
order, he said that the greater visibility such troops would 
be an important factor in sending a psychological message of 
stability.  Expanded training and more effective screening of 
Iraqi security forces was urgently needed, he said. 
Commenting on problems with Iraqi security forces, Yelda 
claimed that Baathist elements had infiltrated the Iraqi 
forces, resulting in the common use of police or other 
security service uniforms in many kidnappings and other 
crimes.  In fact, Yelda recounted how he himself had been the 
target of an assassination attempt in which a bomb had 
exploded at his residence.  Several men posing as security 
agents arrived in uniform in the aftermath of the explosion 
and attempted to take the wounded Ambassador away.  Yelda 
said he was able to hold them off until legitimate 
authorities arrived, at which point the impostors fled. 
(Note: Yelda said he had been injured in the blast and had 
undergone medical treatment in England on two separate 
occasions for his injuries.  End note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Baathists Behind Violence; Christians at Risk 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Yelda acknowledged that foreign elements were 
carrying out many of the terrorist bombings in Iraq, but 
maintained that Baathist elements were pulling the strings. 
For Yelda, the targeting of Christian churches was a 
particularly unsettling aspect of the terror.  He said the 
Baathists wanted to make the point that the new government 
could not or would not protect Christians -- this in 
comparison to the relatively secure situation for Christians 
under Saddam.  Yelda described a difficult situation for 
Christians, claiming that since April insurgents had killed 
Christian women or girls at the rate of nearly one per day. 
He said interim government officials had asked \"the 
Americans\" to do more to protect Christians, but with little 
improvement in the situation, many were fleeing the country. 
The Ambassador assured Yelda that protection of Christians 
was a key USG priority, reflected both in frequent contacts 
between our Embassy in Baghdad and Christian leaders as well 
as in our Embassy\'s contact with the Holy See. 
 
5.  (C) As a Christian, Yelda said he felt a special 
responsibility to help protect his co-religionists in Iraq. 
Though he is a member of the Assyrian Church of the East and 
not a Catholic, he will find common ground with the Vatican 
on this issue.  (Note: Unlike the Chaldean Catholic Church, 
the majority Christian group in Iraq, the Assyrian Church of 
the East is not in union with Rome.  The Chaldeans share 
common roots with the Assyrians, dating back to the second 
century, but broke off from the Assyrian Church of the East 
in the sixteenth century.  Following periods of acrimony, 
relations between the Assyrian and Chaldean Churches have 
improved somewhat in recent years, as have relations between 
the Assyrians and the Holy See.  End note.) 
 
----------------------------- 
More Aggressive Stance Needed 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) According to Yelda, coalition and Iraqi forces needed 
to be more aggressive against the insurgents.  He 
acknowledged concerns about violating sacred Islamic ground, 
but insisted that there were limits.  \"There are tunnels and 
passageways underneath these mosques\" where the terrorists 
store weapons and \"actually conduct training exercises,\" he 
said.  Yelda noted with grim approval coalition operations in 
Fallujah, qualifying his praise only with the criticism that 
the crackdown should have come sooner.  He implied that if 
the coalition and Iraqi forces were to be successful, 
additional similar operations would be needed in other towns. 
 
-------------------------- 
Gratitude for Intervention 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  On behalf of his people and government, Yelda 
thanked the Ambassador for the U.S. intervention in Iraq, and 
said he regretted the loss of American lives.  He appealed to 
the USG to stay the course in Iraq, saying that U.S. forces 
would be needed in the country \"for a very very long time.\" 
Yelda said that he was not supportive of a much larger role 
for the UN in Iraq at this time.  According to Ambassador 
Yelda, the countries who had already sacrificed their 
soldiers and finances should be the ones to maintain 
influence there.  In this connection, he said that he would 
be disappointed to see French or German influence in Iraq. 
Yelda was optimistic about the upcoming elections, though he 
cautioned that after decades of tyranny, \"democracy would not 
come overnight.\"  He said education and job creation would be 
key factors in developing a strong Iraqi democracy.

8.  (C)  Though the Rammadi native had been living in England 
since the 1970s, Yelda moved back to Baghdad last spring, and 
seems to have had more than his share of action since then, 
given the October assassination and kidnapping attempts.  His 
background in England will continue to influence his work 
here.  Until Yelda\'s arrival, the most prominent Iraqi in 
Vatican circles was Monsignor Philip Najim, representative of 
the Chaldean Patriarch.  There is no love lost between Yelda 
and Najim, who knew each other when both lived in England. 
Yelda grimaced when asked if he had had much contact yet with 
Najim in Rome, but offered that he had invited the monsignor 
to accompany him to his November presentation of credentials 
to the Pope.  Yelda claimed that many Iraqi ex-pats in London 
had a poor impression of Najim since, Yelda hinted darkly, 
Najim was sometimes identified with the old regime.  For his 
part, Najim (protect) lambasted Yelda in a meeting with 
Poloff some weeks ago, calling him \"worthless\" and \"a drunk.\" 
 We saw no evidence of the latter, though Yelda did lament 
the tame nightlife in Rome, noting that there was much more 
to do in the after-hours in London. 
 
9.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered.

SOLIDARITY TO PROMOTE PEACE

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.In his 2005 World day of Peace Message, Pope John Paul 
II challenged the world to focus on the \"common good\" of 
all humanity, creating a more equitable world that would be 
more conducive to peace.  He asked nations and peoples to 
withstand the temptation of responding to evil with more 
evil and to avoid looking at conflicts and inequities 
through the prism of narrow national interests.  As he 
condemned social and political evils and violence 
afflicting the world, the Pope called for greater resource 
sharing and solidarity with poor countries, especially 
African states.  He noted the importance of sharing science 
and technology, the adoption of equitable trade practices, 
and poverty reduction.  A globalized world, said the 
Pontiff, requires all world citizens to take responsibility 
for those who are suffering.  In this way, he argued, 
nations can make an \"effective contribution\" to \"building a 
world based on the values...of peace.\"  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
COMBAT EVIL WITH GOOD - NOT MORE EVIL 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
2.In his message for the 2005 World Day of Peace 
(complete text faxed to EUR/WE), Pope John Paul II urged 
attention to the \"good\" of moral values as a way to combat 
evil.  [Note: The Pope will formally deliver the message 
January 1, 2005, but the Vatican released the text in a 
mid-December press conference.  End Note.]  The Pope asked 
nations and peoples to withstand the temptation of 
responding to evil with more evil, and instead to focus on 
n 
the \"common good\" for all humanity.  Evil, he explained, 
was \"not some impersonal, deterministic force,\" but a 
result of wrong choices made by men and women who freely 
choose to do evil.  By focusing on \"world citizenship\" 
rather than narrow national, ethnic or other parochial 
interests, the Pope believes, a more equitable world can be 
built that would be more conducive to peace. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
VIOLENCE AND TERROR CONDEMNED; PROFOUND REGRET OVER IRAQ 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
3.  In identifying the gravest instances of evil and 
violence in the world, the Pontiff identified regional 
hotspots with particularly troubling outbreaks of violence, 
pointing to Africa (described as the Pope\'s \"beloved 
continent\"), Palestine, and Iraq.  Regarding the latter, 
the Pope asked how one could not think \"with profound 
regret of the drama unfolding in Iraq, which has given rise 
to tragic situations of uncertainty and insecurity for 
all?\"  John Paul condemned the \"troubling phenomenon of 
terrorist violence\" that  he said appeared to be \"driving 
the whole world toward a future of fear and anguish.\"  He 
soundly condemned all violence as an unacceptable evil that 
never solves problems.  \"Violence is a lie . . . that 
destroys what it claims to defend:  the dignity, the life, 
the freedom of human beings,\" the Pope declared. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
SHARING THE EARTH\'S GOODS  WITHOUT TRADE BARRIERS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3.Central to promoting conditions conducive to peace, 
the message argues, is greater resource sharing.  According 
to the Pope, all people deserve a share in the goods of the 
earth in order to be able feed and house their families 
with hope for the future.  In practice, the Pope called on 
the international community to assume greater 
responsibility for sharing resources equitably.  In this 
context he mentioned the obligation of wealthier nations to 
o 
aid in the development of less-developed nations. 
According to the Pope, a true sharing in development would 
become possible \"once the barriers and monopolies that 
marginalize many peoples are removed.\"  The Pontiff said 
that in today\'s globalized world, the public had to be all 
the more vigilant in the fight against poverty, the 
promotion of peace and security, and concern for climate 
change and disease control. 
 
------------------------------------ 
DEBT FORGIVENESS WITH ACCOUNTABILITY 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
4.The Pope gave special mention to debt forgiveness for 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs), noting that he had 
placed the issue on the international agenda some fifteen 
years ago.  While acknowledging the effectiveness of recent 
debt-forgiveness initiatives, John Paul II said a lack of 
foreign investment, the price of raw materials, and poorly- 
functioning international organizations had smothered 
economic growth in poor countries.  He concluded that poor 
countries remained trapped in a vicious circle. 
 
--------------------------- 
KEEPING THE FOCUS ON AFRICA 
--------------------------- 
 
5.Africa was the only region to garner an in-depth 
discussion, with the Pope urging a radical new direction 
for the continent to overcome the armed conflicts, pandemic 
diseases, extreme poverty, and political instability that 
have led to widespread insecurity there.  Citing the 
responsibilities of \"world citizenship,\" the Pope called 
for a new bilateral and multilateral solidarity for Africa, 
and stressed that the wellbeing of Africans was part of the 
common good of all. \"Development either becomes shared in 
common by every part of the world, or it undergoes a 
process of regression even in areas marked by constant 
progress,\" he concluded.   The Pope urged Africans to take 
control of their own cultural, civil, social and economic 
development.   Africa, he said, had to stop being a mere 
recipient of aid, and had to ensure greater transparency 
and accountability in its development partnerships with 
wealthier countries.  In Africa, the Pope clearly sees a 
decisive test for world peace in how all concerned 
countries tackle the continent\'s tremendous challenges. 
 
------------------------------------ 
COMMENT: A BROAD FRAMEWORK FOR PEACE 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.As reported reftel, the Vatican has not altered its 
doctrine on the legitimate use of force as a last-resort 
response to war and violence.  The 2005 World Day of Peace 
Message, however, is clearly seeking to move the 
international focus beyond the immediate need to prevent 
aggression or terrorist violence to the broader sources of 
conflict.  In the Pope\'s vision, a comprehensive framework 
of solidarity between peoples that addresses global 
deprivation and inequality could diminish the likelihood of 
human conflict before it begins, thus promoting lasting 
peace.  The Holy See\'s focus on moral values is not in this 
case on the sexual moral values so often accented in the 
media, but on the broader moral values of social justice 
drawn from the Church\'s extensive teaching on the subject. 
As the message concludes, \"By the mere fact of being 
conceived, \"a child is entitled to rights\" that can only be 
guaranteed by \"the condemnation racism, . . . aid to 
displaced persons and refugees, and the mobilization of 
international solidarity towards all the needy\" in a 
consistent application of the principle of world 
citizenship.  The focus on Africa reflects the Pope\'s 
belief that no other region presents a greater moral 
challenge to the international community today.

SUBJECT: Pope in Meeting with Anti-Defamation League Calls 
for Eradicating Anti-Semitism 
 
 
1.(U) Summary:  Meeting with representatives of the 
Anti-Defamation League in Vatican City December 17, Pope 
John Paul II called for the eradication of all forms of 
racism, including anti-Semitism.  The Pontiff emphasized 
that the Catholic Church and the Jewish people enjoy close 
bonds of friendship.  ADL national Director Abraham Foxman 
replied to the Pope\'s greeting with high praise for John 
Paul II\'s efforts as a priest and as Pope to fight anti- 
Semitism.  He said the Catholic Church, at John Paul II\'s 
behest, had reckoned with its past and had entered into a 
partnership of mutual acceptance and cooperation with thcracy.\" 
ADL National Director Abraham Foxman praised 
the Pope\'s \"true moral leadership\" as a light to the world, 
and expressed his appreciation for the Roman Catholic 
Church\'s collaboration with ADL.  The ADL president said 
that Karol Wojtyla had defended Jews as a priest in Poland, 
had denounced anti-Semitism as a \'sin against God and 
humanity,\' and had paid homage to victims of the Holocaust 
at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.  He added that the Pope\'s 
historic visit to Ropme\'s synagogue had \"breached centuries 
of pain and mistrust.\"  In a poignant personal note, Foxman 
recalled that, during the Holocaust, his Catholic nanny 
with the help of a Catholic priest had literally saved his 
life.  Foxman concluded that Catholics and Jews were \"truly 
together in history for the first time.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Following the meeting with the Pope, Fr. Norbert 
Hofmann, Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Religious 
Relations with the Jews and a 2005 IVP Recipient, told 
Embassy that his Council was very pleased with the ADL\'s 
December 15-16 Rome conference and the side meetings 
between ADL representatives and Council President Walter 
Kaspar.  \"I\'ve never heard Foxman so positive about 
Catholic-Jewish relations,\" Hoffmann observed. 
 
4.  (SBU) At a reception at the Israeli Ambassador\'s 
following the event, Foxman affirmed the ADL\'s satisfaction 
with the current state of Catholic-Jewish relations.  He 
told DCM that Pope John Paul II has largely succeeded in 
putting the vision for improved relations outlined in the 
Second Vatican Council\'s \"Nostra Aetate\" -- the framework 
for the Church\'s relations with non-Christian religions -- 
into practice.  At the same time, Foxman expressed concern 
that anti-Semitism emanating from the Middle East was on 
the rise worldwide, and would need continued and deepening 
Vatican engagement to overcome its newest manifestations. 
 
5.  (SBU) A senior ADL representative told DCM the League 
saw the primary challenge for the Holy See now in the realm 
of education -- specifically, to expand understanding of 
Nostra Aetate beyond the Roman Curia.  In particular, ADL 
was encouraging Holy See outreach in Latin America, where 
they have found anti-Semitic opinions are more prevalent 
than in Europe and North America.  ADL\'s representative 
pointed out that Nostra Aetate was not initially translated 
into Spanish, and that pre-Vatican II teachings of the 
responsibility of the Jewish people for Christ\'s 
crucifixion were not widely circulated in Latin America or 
replaced by Nostra Aetate\'s vision of a common spiritual 
heritage and its formal rejection of all forms of anti- 
Semitism. 
 
6.  (SBU) The only mild concern raised by ADL of the 
Vatican related to the level of their participation in the 
Rome conference, which attracted Italian FM Fini, EU 
Commissioner Frattini, Senate President Pera, House Speaker 
Cassini, and Interior Minister Pisanu.  By contrast, the 
Holy See sent the third ranking official in the 
Congregation responsible for relations with non-Christian 
religious.  Foxman said he understood this related to the 
co-sponsorship of the conference by the \"Il Foglio\" 
newspaper, which is often critical of the Vatican.  Father 
Hofmann, however, denied that Il Foglio\'s co-sponsorship of 
the conference led Cardinal Kasper to forego the ADL event 
personally.  \"I\'ve heard those rumors too,\" Hofmann said, 
\"but it\'s not true.\"  Instead, Hofmann contended that the 
 
 
ADL had only invited Kasper to participate three weeks ago 
and Kaspar had made previous commitments that he could not 
forego.  \"You might be able to get away with that for an 
Italian Cardinal, but you\'ve got to give a German Cardinal 
more notice than that,\" fellow-German Hofmann chuckled.  He 
insisted that everything was \"kosher\" with the ADL, Il 
Foglio, and the Vatican. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  Pope John Paul II\'s determination to 
improve Jewish-Catholic relations, reflected in his 
historic visits to Rome\'s synagogue and to Israel in 2000, 
have clearly borne fruit.  What was once a difficult 
dialogue between Jewish groups and the Holy See is now 
regular, cordial and open, with satisfaction on all sides 
for the new level of understanding.  The challenge ahead 
for both sides will be to extend this understanding beyond 
the center to ever more Bishops\' Councils and local 
churches.  In this way, the Holy See can contribute 
worldwide to ongoing efforts to overcome historic 
prejudices and promote better inter-religious dialogue and 
understanding.  As Foxman concluded in his message to the 
Pope:  \"We need more leaders like you to step forward, 
raise their voices in condemnation, and to emulate your 
exercise of true moral leadership.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) During his December 1 - 4 visit to the Vatican, 
Ambassador at large for International Religious Freedom John 
Hanford reviewed U.S. religious freedom concerns and priorities 
with Holy See Foreign Minister Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo 
and other senior officials.  Vatican officials highlighted 
their concerns over the persecution of Christians in China, 
Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India and Sudan.  They also 
emphasized the importance of juridical recognition to 
protect churches from government pressure and manipulation, 
specifically in Russia and Vietnam.  Many Vatican concerns 
track with the recently released IRF report, but the Holy 
See urged continued U.S. pressure on countries of concern. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Religious Liberty Linked to Other Freedoms 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) In a December 3 meeting with the Holy See\'s 
Secretary for Relations with States Archbishop Giovanni 
 
SIPDIS 
Lajolo, Ambassador for International Religious Freedom John 
Hanford emphasized that the U.S. was working to advance religious 
freedom for Catholics and those of other religions wherever 
it is under threat.  The priority the U.S. attaches to this 
issue, Hanford said, is reflected in the expansion in staff 
in the State Department\'s Office of Religious Freedom, 
which is charged with monitoring problems and advocating 
with countries of concern for greater freedom.  Archbishop 
Lajolo welcomed the U.S. focus on religious freedom, 
observing, \"when there is no religious liberty, there is no 
political liberty -- all freedoms are connected.\" 
 
-------------------------- 
China Top Vatican Priority 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Lajolo made clear that China is the Holy See\'s 
priority religious freedom concern.  He pointed out that 
the Holy See had repeatedly made known to China that they 
had nothing to fear from greater freedom for Catholics. 
He noted that the Chinese often cite Poland as an example 
of how the Church helped topple a communist government, but 
that the two cases were completely different.  The Vatican 
has pointed out that the percentage of Catholics in China 
is minuscule compared to Poland -- 8-30 million in a 
country of well over a billion people -- but this has yet 
to assuage Chinese anxieties. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador Hanford observed that he has devoted 
considerable focus to China and has visited the country 
twice, in each case raising Catholic concerns with various 
Chinese authorities.  Hanford said he has heard a standard 
litany of four reasons why no progress in possible:  Holy 
See relations with Taiwan, the Pope\'s decision to canonize 
Chinese saints on a sensitive day for the Chinese 
government, the need for a stronger apology from the Pope 
for this decision, and the need for the Holy See to make a 
gesture toward the Chinese government.  Hanford said he 
understood that in regard publicly stated its willingness to shift relations from 
Taiwan to the PRC swiftly should the Chinese open up that 
possibility.  He said he also emphasized to Chinese 
authorities that the Pope\'s apology for the date of the 
canonization had been strong and was more than might have 
been expected. 
 
5. (C) Lajolo noted that the Vatican receives occasional 
signals from the Chinese that they want to get in touch and 
begin a dialogue with the Embassy in Rome, but they are 
 
 
never sure who they will be dealing with and whether the 
contact would be authorized or could be a trap in which the 
Chinese authorities could accuse the Vatican of trying to 
work through sec ret channels.  Lajolo said the Holy See\'s 
impression was that attitudes at the top of the Chinese 
hierarchy were more open to contact, but that at the middle 
and lower levels, there was considerably more resistance. 
Ambassador Hanford noted that senior officials with whom he 
had met often displayed a naive view of Christianity and 
the differences among various Christian groups.  Overall, 
Hanford noted that he had been disappointed with the 
Chinese response to the concerns the U.S. had raised. 
Lajolo shared Hanford\'s disappointment, but said it was the 
Church\'s responsibility to \"try and try again.\"  In a 
separate meeting, Frank Dewane of the Pontifical Council of 
Justice and Peace noted that the Chinese are aware of the 
presence of Catholic priests in China for professional 
reasons.  For example, Jesuit and Maryknoll professors 
currently serve on Chinese university faculties, and their 
presence offers the Holy See a small window into the country.

Keeping Pressure on Saudi Arabia 
-------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Asked about the situation in Saudi Arabia, whose 
inclusion on the list of countries of particular concern 
(CPC) was welcomed by the Holy See, Hanford said the U.S. 
wanted to nudge the government even though they were taking 
some positive steps.  He cited the Saudis\' efforts to 
replace school books that described other faiths in 
\"horrible\" ways.  Hanford noted that he had met with the 
Italian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, who was very active in 
working with Catholic communities in Saudi Arabia to 
facilitate private Catholic services.  He said the Saudis 
know Masses are taking place and that there are priests in 
the country; they are willing to tolerate this as long as 
no further effort is made to regularize their presence and 
activities.  Lajolo said he appreciates that the Saudi 
royal family is under pressure, but he belies it is also 
vital for Catholics and other Christians to be able to 
worship without fear in the kingdom. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Bridging Gaps Between Theory and Practice 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) In separate meetings with Under-Secretary Frank 
Dewane of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and 
the Vatican-linked Sant,Egidio Community, Hanford was told 
that although the situation in some countries may look 
acceptable on paper, the situation on the ground faced by 
priests and religious communities is frequently much 
worse.  Dewane said he had reviewed the most recent IRF 
report and found that the assessments were not always as 
\"crisp\" as they could be.  He feared that international 
political pressures came into play in some country 
reports.  He suggested that the Holy See might be more 
critical of certain countries, behavior, particularly 
that of Pakistan and India.  Hanford responded that the U.S. 
strives for complete accuracy and honesty in drafting the 
report and would welcome Vatican information and feedback 
if officials felt the report was at all \"whitewashing\" a 
country\'s record. 
 
--------------------------------- 
\"Don\'t Let Pakistan Off the Hook\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Using virtually identical language, Monsignor Dewane 
and Sant,Egidio,s Claudio Betti both urged Hanford 
emphatically \"not to let Pakistan off the hook.\"  Citing 
Pakistan\'s blasphemy laws and persecution of Christians, 
Dewane said many Pakistanis who had been charged under the 
blasphemy ordinances were forced to flee the country in 
 
 
fear of their lives rather than fight the charges in 
Pakistan.  In the broader Middle East, Dewane emphasized 
that the U.S. must recognize the growing flight of 
Christians from the Middle East.  \"Parents do not see a 
future for their children there,\" he said.  Maronite 
(Catholic) Bishop El-Hachem in Lebanon recently told 
Dewane that \"soon there\'ll be no one left.\" 
Dewane pointed out that it is a human rights violation 
to be driven out of one\'s country. 
 
While the Holy See continues to have problems in India, he 
said the Vatican views the IRF country report on India as 
encouragement to the new Indian government to go further in 
protecting its religious minorities and continuing the 
repeal of non-conversion laws as was recently seen in Tamil 
Nadu. 
 
--------------------------- 
Juridicaaries and 
thus the growth and reach of the church.  Sant\'Egidio reps 
pointed to problems in Sudan, where the Community has been 
working for several years to protect churches and 
Christians.  Sant\'Egidio\'s Fabio Riccardi cited two 
instances where his direct appeal to contacts in the 
Sudanese government had saved Christian churches from the 
bull-dozers.

Comment

10.  (C) Ambassador Hanford\'s participation in Embassy\'s 
conference on religious freedom and his meetings with 
Vatican officials reinforced a crucial area of common 
interest between the USG and the Holy See and helped focus 
attention on problem areas.  Rooted in its interest in 
ensuring freedom for Catholics to worship worldwide, the 
Holy See has become a strong advocate for freedom for all 
faiths.  Embassy greatly appreciates Ambassador Hanford\'s 
engagement and will maintain a close dialogue with the Holy 
See to share perspectives on areas of concern where the 
Holy See\'s \"on the ground\" perspective may offer insights 
on ways forward.

SUBJECT: POPE URGES GENUINE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CUBA 
 
 
1.(U) Pope John Paul II told Cuba\'s new Ambassador to 
the Holy See January 8 that the Catholic Church needed 
\"genuine religious freedom\" in order to be more effective 
in promoting the good of the Cuban people.  Such freedom, 
according to the Pope, included better access to Cuba by 
foreign missionaries as well as the ability to maintain 
links with Catholics in other countries.  The Pope said 
Cuba\'s Catholic Church was ideally suited to promote the 
common good of the people, and he told the Cuban Ambassador 
that religious liberty would ensure it was even more 
effective in this service.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) In a strong appeal for greater religious freedom in 
Cuba, the Pope vigorously defended the role of the Catholic 
Church in Cuba during the presentation of credentials by 
Cuba\'s new Ambassador to the Holy See, Raul Roa Kouri.  The 
Pope pointed out that the Church played a vital role in 
promoting human dignity, working on behalf of the family 
and supporting the education of a new generation in the 
culture of life, peace and hope.  He also cited the 
Church\'s potential to shed light on the complex 
relationship between economics and spiritual values. 
 
3.  (U) The Pope\'s call for religious freedom was, however, 
prefaced by praise for Cuba\'s spirit of solidarity and 
compassion \"made evident by sending personnel and material 
resources and basic necessities to various populations 
affected by natural disasters, conflict or poverty.\"  John 
Paul II also referred to the U.S. economic embargo against 
Cuba, saying that the Holy See hopes that the obstacles 
impeding free communication and trade \"be overcome as soon 
as possible.\"  The Pope maintained that Cuba\'s development 
depended on respectful and open dialogue with everyone. 
 
4. (U) Career diplomat Raul Roa Kouri previously served as 
ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Ambassador to France, 
and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs.  His reply to the 
Pope -- peppered with anti-American rhetoric -- lamented 
the rise of neo-liberal capitalism that made a few rich 
countries wealthier but impoverished many others.  Roa 
Kouri also criticized \"first world\" efforts at the United 
Nations to maintain an economic, financial and trade 
embargo on Cuba.  Kouri juxtaposed the Pope\'s efforts to 
build a \"better world\" with Fidel Castro\'s, citing Cuba\'s 
efforts around the world and at home in the medical and 
educational fields and even likening Cuban doctors working 
overseas to Church missionaries. 
 
5. (SBU) Holy See Country Director for Cuba Monsignor 
Giorgio Lingua told us January 11 that, while the Pope\'s 
speech contained nothing groundbreaking, it was important 
for the Holy See to reemphasize its position on Cuba every 
so often, particularly its desire for greater religious 
freedom.  According to Lingua, Vatican Foreign Minister- 
equivalent Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo delivered a similar 
message to the Cuban ambassador when the two met for a 
courtesy call on the margins of the Papal audience.  \"We 
try to reinforce our position when we can,\" said Lingua. 
Nevertheless, he foresaw no change in the dynamic of the 
Cuba-Holy See relationship.  Lingua did note that the Pope 
had continued his emphasis upon the importance of religious 
freedom by devoting a sizable portion of his annual address 
to the Vatican Diplomatic Corps to the topic two days after 
his remarks on Cuba (septel).

FOCUS ON LIFE, FOOD, PEACE, AND FREEDOM 
 
REF:  04 Vatican 4882 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) In the face of the natural and manmade 
catastrophes that afflicted the world over the past year, 
Pope John Paul II\'s New Year address to the Vatican 
diplomatic corps set out four challenges facing world 
leaders that closely parallel priority U.S. policy goals: 
the defense of life, the conquest of hunger, the pursuit of 
world peace, and the advancement of liberty, particularly 
religious liberty.  In the face of armed conflicts on every 
continent, the Pope counseled reason and dialogue over 
force, in keeping with his World Peace Day theme of 
responding to evil with good.  Contrary to some media 
reports, the Pope did not suggest that the U.S. had acted 
with arrogance.  The context of his remarks makes clear 
that the \"arrogance of power,\" as reflected in dictators or 
aggressors be met with dialogue rather than force.  To meet 
the challenge of \"life,\" the Pope rejected human cloning, 
but welcomed adult stem cell research.  To combat hunger, 
he called for \"a vast moral mobilization,\" and urged 
prosperous countries to step up assistance.  He lamented 
armed conflicts and condemned the \"brutal, inhuman 
phenomenon of terrorism,\" but expressed hope that the 
Darfur settlement and the election of a new Palestinian 
president would lead to a decrease in armed confrontation. 
The Pope reinforced his fervent commitment to freedom, 
noting that religious freedom is a right \"not yet 
sufficiently or adequately recognized.  The Pope\'s 
international agenda tracked closely with a series of 
Embassy initiatives this past year aimed at increasing Holy 
See attention to problems of hunger, religious freedom, and 
terrorism.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND CHALLENGE 
------------------------------- 
 
2.(U) Addressing the 174 members of the Vatican 
diplomatic corps for the 27th year, Pope John Paul II 
called on represented countries to meet four fundamental 
challenges to restore hope in a world which has seen 
tremendous \"anguish and distress\" over the past year. 
Building on his theme for World Peace Day of \"overcoming 
evil with good\" (reftel), the Pope cautioned against 
discouragement and proposed a focus on \"the common bonds of 
humanity\" in meeting four specific challenges:  protection 
of human life, ending the evil of hunger, restoring peace, 
and expanding the reach of freedom. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
UNDERSTANDING THE \"ARROGANCE OF POWER\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Some American media has seized on the Pope\'s use 
of the phrase \"arrogance of power\" to suggest that the Pope 
was criticizing the U.S. for acting arrogantly in Iraq. 
Such an interpretation distorts the Pope\'s intention, which 
was to urge that dictators, corrupt leaders, and others who 
pursue armed conflicts be met not with force but with 
reason and dialogue:  \"The arrogance of power must be 
countered with reason, force with dialogue, pointed weapons 
with outstretched hands, evil with good.\"  To the extent 
the Pope was speaking about Iraq, his words should be seen 
as a caution that an \"arrogant\" dictator such as Saddam 
should have been met with dialogue, reason, and patience 
rather than force.  This has been the Pope\'s consistent 
view on Iraq, and represents an elaboration of the theme of 
his World Peace Day message (reftel) of overcoming evil 
with good. 
 
4.  (SBU) The Pope\'s only specific mention of Iraq in his 
remarks was to condemn \"the acts of barbarous terrorism 
which caused bloodshed in Iraq and other countries of the 
world.  While certainly there is implicit criticism of Iraq 
in his suggestion that recourse to arms had \"increased the 
causes of tension,\" this comment was cast in reference to 
conflicts \"from one end of the world to the other . . .  in 
the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, where 
recourse to arms and violence has not only led to 
incalculable material damage, but also fomented hatred and 
increased causes of tension, thereby adding to the 
difficulty of finding and implementing solutions capable of 
reconciling legitimate interest of all the parties 
involved.\" 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
DEFEND HUMAN LIFE AND THE FAMILY 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) Noting that states have as their primary task the 
\"safeguarding and promotion of human life,\" the Pope 
asserted that the challenge to human life has recently 
\"grown in scale and urgency.\"  Describing abortion, 
assisted procreation, the use of embryonic stem cells for 
scientific research, and cloning as \"ethically 
inadmissible,\" he nevertheless called for continued genetic 
research using adult stem cells.  The Pope also called 
attention to what the termed \"the very sanctuary of life\" - 
-- the family -- which he asserted was under threat from 
legislation in many countries permitting same-sex unions. 
 
-------------------------------- 
FOOD SECURITY THROUGH SOLDIARITY 
-------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) Turning to an issue that has been a major focus on 
Embassy engagement with the Holy See, the Pope lamented 
that hundreds of millions of human beings are suffering 
from grave malnutrition and \"millions of children die each 
year from its effects.\"  Unfortunately, the Pope stopped 
short of endorsing the potential of biotechnology to 
address world hunger, and instead stuck with the Vatican\'s 
standard call for a greater \"commitment to justice\" and 
\"display of solidarity.\"  Significantly, however, he 
emphasized the Holy See\'s \"great interest in this dramatic 
problem.  He praised the work of international 
organizations and NGO\'s who have been active in providing 
assistance, but insisted that current efforts were \"not 
enough.\"  An adequate response to overcome the evil of 
hunger, he maintained, would require \"a vast mobilization\" 
of public opinion and political leaders, particularly in 
more prosperous countries. 
 
-------------- 
BUILDING PEACE 
-------------- 
 
7.(U) Peace, which the Pope characterized as \"the dream 
of every generation\" and a \"supreme good\" essential to 
attaining goods, was the third primary challenge facing 
humanity, according to the Pontiff.  As noted above, John 
Paul II denounced the recourse to armed conflict in the 
Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America.  He also 
issued a forceful condemnation of terrorism, terming it \"a 
brutal, inhuman phenomenon\" and \"a scourge which has taken 
on a global dimension unknown to previous generations.\" 
The Pope noted that he has consistently sought to point out 
\"paths to peace\" and has counseled \"courage and patience\" 
in pursuing them. 
 
8.  (U) Despite the many threats to peace, the Pope sought 
to deliver an optimistic message that this challenge could 
be met through a common will to prevent conflicts and 
greater cooperation between international organizations and 
continental groupings.  In this regard, the Pope praised 
the efforts of the African Union to prevent conflicts and 
cited progress in Darfur, the Great Lakes and Somalia. 
Turing to the Middle East, the Pope welcomed the decrease 
in armed confrontation and expressed his hope for a 
political breakthrough with the election of the new 
Palestinian president.  The Pope hailed the European Union 
as an example of how past enemies could put their 
differences aside and consolidate their union, as well as 
remain open to new members. 
 
-------------------- 
YEARNING FOR FREEDOM 
-------------------- 
 
9.  (U) Citing the struggle of his native Polish people, 
the Pope concluded by reaffirming that freedom offered \"the 
only way human beings can find fulfillment befitting their 
nature.\"  Religious freedom, the Pope elaborated, was \"at 
the heart of all freedoms.\"   Noting the many express 
international guarantees for religious freedom, the Pope 
pointed out that in many states such freedom was \"not yet 
sufficiently or adequately recognized.\"  He therefore 
appealed for religious freedom to be constitutionally 
guaranteed everywhere.  Responding to fears of Muslim 
states that such freedom would interfere with secular 
government, the Pope insisted the Church was able to 
distinguish \"what belongs to Caesar and what belongs to 
God.\"  Freedom, he concluded, would allow the Church to 
cooperate effectively for the good of societies and 
 
 
consequently for the good of mankind. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10.(SBU) Despite the media\'s eagerness to find criticism 
of the U.S. in the Pope\'s \'state of the world\' address, the 
Pope has consistently avoided looking backward at Iraq.  As 
he observed, he sees his goal as pointing out \"paths to 
peace\" and urging they be followed.  Since the decision to 
go to war, he has looked forward and offered support for 
U.S. efforts to help the Iraqis build stability and 
democracy.  Other freelancing members of the Curia, such as 
retired Cardinal Pio Laghi, whose recent outburst critical 
of the U.S. for failing to achieve a rapid and effective 
transition has been widely reported, have been more prone 
to try to score points through the Italian media.  Their 
views, however, do not reflect official Holy See policies. 
 
11.  (SBU) In fact, Laghi\'s remarks, according to an 
Italian journalist source, came in response to a question 
posed to him by a Vatican journalist, who surprised him 
with the question by quoting previous Laghi comments 
following his White House meeting that U.S. officials had 
promised the war would be quick and effective.  Laghi 
simply concurred with the journalist that the war had been 
neither quick nor effective.  In fact, Laghi\'s previous 
statement recounted a conversation not with the President, 
but with a military aide present during the White House 
meetings. 
 
12.  (SBU) Beyond the media focus on Iraq, the Pope\'s 
perspective on the primary challenges facing the world 
today and his agenda for dealing with them tracks closely 
with U.S. efforts.  From combating hunger and promoting 
religious freedom to defeating terror and protecting human 
rights, these goals parallel Embassy efforts this past year 
to heighten the Vatican\'s focus on these issues through a 
series of outreach conferences and regular engagement at 
senior levels.  We can expect to see the Vatican return to 
these themes -- the renunciation of war and violence, the 
condemnation of terrorism, economic solidarity to confront 
poverty and hunger, and insistence on religious freedom as 
a natural universal right -- in the year ahead.  It was 
unfortunate that the Pope was not yet willing to publicly 
embrace the potential of agricultural biotechnology in his 
discussion of hunger, and Embassy will continue to press 
the Holy See to see biotechnology as an important tool in 
addressing this priority challenge.
