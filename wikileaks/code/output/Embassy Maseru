SUBJECT:  LESOTHO: ONE YEAR AFTER SADC MILITARY INTERVENTION 
 
SUMMARY:  NOT WITH A BANG... 
-------------------------- 
 
1. LESOTHO IS MUDDLING THROUGH AN ARTIFICIAL AND UNEASY 
CALM ONE YEAR AFTER A REGIONAL MILITARY INTERVENTION TO 
REVERSE AN ARMY MUTINY AND FORESTALL AN ATTEMPT TO 
OVERTHROW THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT. THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE DRAMATIC EVENTS OF 1998 PASSED WITH LITTLE NOTICE 
BY MANY HERE AND SEPTEMBER 22 APPEARED A DAY LIKE ANY 
OTHER.  HOWEVER, THE POLITICAL POLARIZATION THAT 
GENERATED THE AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 1998 POLITICAL/SECURITY 
CRISIS IS FAR FROM BEING RESOLVED.  INSTITUTIONAL 
MECHANISMS PUT IN PLACE WITH THE HELP OF REGIONAL PLAYERS 
TO FACILITATE A PROCESS OF RESOLUTION ARE AT AN IMPASSE. 
PLANS TO HOLD NEW ELECTIONS IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2000 
HAVE STALLED.  POLITICAL PARTIES ARE STILL AT LOGGERHEADS 
AND HARBOR MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE NOT 
AMENABLE TO COMPROMISE. THERE WERE NO COMMEMORATIVE 
EVENTS BY EITHER THE GOVERNING OR OPPOSITION PARTIES -- 
EXCEPT FOR THE OPPOSITION COALITION\'S UNVEILING A 
SCULPTURE DEDICATED TO THE \"HEROES\" OF THE ARMY WHO WERE 
\"MARTYRED\" AS THEY DEFENDED THE COUNTRY FROM FOREIGN 
\"INVADERS.\"  AS A MEASURE OF THEIR RENEWED CONFIDENCE, 
THE PRIME MINISTER, THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND THE 
FOREIGN MINISTER WERE TRAVELING OVERSEAS WITH NO WORRIES 
ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE OF LAW AND ORDER DURING THEIR 
ABSENCE.  END SUMMARY 
 
ANNIVERSARY OF A CRISIS 
----------------------- 
 
2. ON SEPTEMBER 22, 1998, AT THE REQUEST OF PRIME 
MINISTER PAKALITHA MOSISILI AND WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF 
THE HEADS OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY 
(SADC), MILITARY FORCES FROM SOUTH AFRICA INTERVENED IN 
THE POLITICAL/ SECURITY CRISIS THAT WAS UNFOLDING IN 
LESOTHO.  THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL DEFENSE FORCE WAS 
SOON JOINED BY TROOPS FROM BOTSWANA WHO BATTLED WITH ARMY 
MUTINEERS AND THEIR OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN HEAVY 
FIREFIGHTS FOR THREE DAYS.  UNFORTUNATELY, BY THAT TIME, 
NEARLY 100 PEOPLE WERE DEAD AND ARSONISTS AND LOOTERS HAD 
DECIMATED THE COMMERCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN LESOTHO\'S 
THREE LARGEST TOWNS, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL, MASERU. 
 
HISTORY, PRECEDENTS AND HARBINGERS... 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. IN 1994\\1995 BOTSWANA, SOUTH AFRICA AND ZIMBABWE BECAME 
GUARANTOR MEMBERS OF THE SADC TROIKA THAT WAS MANDATED TO 
OVERSEE THE PEACE PROCESS AFTER ELEMENTS IN LESOTHO\'S ARMY 
FOMENTED A PALACE COUP LED BY KING LETSIE III. THIS 
GUARANTOR STATUS, UNDER A 1994 MOU, AIMED TO SUPERVISE A 
RETURN TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE IN THE REGION THAT SADC 
WILL NOT TOLERATE EFFORTS TO UNCONSTITUTIONALLY OVERTHROW 
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED MEMBER STATES. THE PALACE COUP 
FOLLOWED REJECTION BY OPPOSITION PARTIES OF THEIR TOTAL 
DEFEAT IN THE 1993 ELECTIONS.  OPPOSITIONISTS ALLEGED, 
BUT DID NOT PROVE, ELECTORAL FRAUD AND VOTE RIGGING. THEY 
USED THIS ALLEGATION TO PRECIPITATE AN ATTEMPT TO 
OVERTHROW OF THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT. 
 
4. AS IN 1994, THE 1998 CIVIL STRIFE FOLLOWED THE 
ELECTORAL DEFEAT BY THE SAME COALITION OF OPPOSITION 
PARTIES WHO AGAIN ALLEGED THEY WERE VICTIMS OF ELECTORAL 
FRAUD.   AN UNAUTHORIZED SEVEN-MONTH- LONG DEMONSTRATION 
AND PALACE VIGIL BY OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS BEGAN IN AUGUST 
1998.  OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS CALLED ON THE KING TO 
OVERTURN THE ELECTION RESULTS URGED HIM TO INSTALL A 
GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY.  EFFORTS BY SOUTH AFRICA\'S 
THEN VICE PRESIDENT, THABO MBEKI, TO MEDIATE A PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION OF THIS ESCALATING CRISIS PROVED FUTILE. 
 
5. THE PALACE VIGIL SOON LED TO AN ARMY MUTINY, THE 
FORCED SHUT DOWN OF THE CAPITAL AND OF PUBLIC OFFICES, 
ALONG WITH HIJACKING OF GOVERNMENT VEHICLES BY OPPOSITION 
ACTIVISTS.  CABINET MEMBERS WENT UNDERGROUND IN FEAR OF 
THEIR LIVES, AS IN 1994, WHEN THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
WAS ASSASSINATED BY COUP PLOTTERS.  IN THIS POLARIZED 
INTERNECINE ATMOSPHERE, THE SADC MILITARY INTERVENTION 
SPARKED AN ORGY OF LOOTING, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, 
BURNING AND LOSS OF LIFE. THE PRIVATE RESIDENCES OF THE 
PRIME MINISTER, SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE CABINET, AND A 
NUMBER OF HIGH LEVEL OFFICIALS WERE DESTROYED BY FIRE AND 
THEIR ANIMALS WERE SLAUGHTERED.   A WELL-ORCHESTRATED 
ASSAULT ON SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESS INTERESTS TOOK PLACE, 
WITH CHINESE AND INDIAN BUSINESSES CAUGHT UP IN THE 
FLASHOVER. SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONALS WERE RANDOMLY 
ATTACKED, VEHICLES BEARING SOUTH AFRICAN REGISTRATION 
NUMBERS WERE VANDALIZED. EXPATRIATE RESIDENTS OF LESOTHO, 
INCLUDING NON- OFFICIAL AMERICANS, EVACUATED THE COUNTRY 
IN LARGE NUMBERS.  IT TOOK THE SOUTH AFRICAN ARMY THREE 
DAYS OF BLOODY FIGHTING TO SUPPRESS THE LDF RESISTANCE 
AND THEIR OPPOSITION ALLIES WHOM THEY ARMED FROM MILITARY 
WEAPONS INVENTORIES. 
 
 
INAUSPICIOUS REMEMBRANCES 
------------------------- 
6.THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN ONE OF MANY REVERSALS FOR LESOTHO. 
AFTER EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE HIGHEST ECONOMIC GROWTH 
RATES IN AFRICA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DECADE, IN ONE YEAR 
LESOTHO\'S GROWTH RATE WENT FROM SEVEN PERCENT TO MINUS 
EIGHT PERCENT.  THOUSANDS OF JOBS WERE LOST IN THE 
DESTRUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES.  THESE 
NEW CASES OF UNEMPLOYMENT EXACERBATE AN ALREADY HIGH RATE 
OF JOBLESSNESS AND THE ASSOCIATE STRESS ON HOUSEHOLDS 
TEETERING ON THE BRINK OF POVERTY.  SMALL ARMS 
TRAFFICKING IS ON THE INCREASE, HOUSEBREAKING AND STREET 
CRIME IS RAMPANT, OPPOSITION PARTIES ARE IN DISARRAY, THE 
ECONOMY IS WEAKER THAN IT WAS A YEAR AGO AND THE 
ELECTORATE IS DESPONDENT. 
 
7. ONE YEAR LATER, THE ROOTS OF LESOTHO\'S CRISIS REMAINS 
UNRESOLVED AND THE FUTURE PEACE OF THE COUNTRY IS FAR 
FROM GUARANTEED.  A RELATIVE AND ARTIFICIAL CALM HAS BEEN 
RETURNED UNDER THE SADC SECURITY UMBRELLA, BUT THIS CALM 
IS ONLY ON THE SURFACE.  THE PEACE ENFORCEMENT PHASE OF 
SADC\'S OPERATION BOLEAS ENDED IN APRIL 1999, AND WAS 
REPLACED BY A SMALLER CONTINGENT OF SADC TROOPS WHO ARE 
TRAINING THE LDF IN CIVIL/MILITARY AFFAIRS WHILE 
REINFORCING CIVIC CALM.  THOUGH MOST BASOTHO ACT AS IF IT 
IS BUSINESS AS USUAL, THE UNDERLYING POLITICAL TENSIONS 
CONTINUE AND A LASTING SOLUTION IS STILL ELUSIVE. 
 
8. FOLLOWING LAST YEAR\'S MILITARY INTERVENTION, AN 
INTERIM POLITICAL AUTHORITY (IPA) WAS FORMED (NOVEMBER 
1998) TO PREPARE THE GROUND FOR NEW ELECTIONS SCHEDULED 
AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS (MAY 2000).  DESPITE LACK OF PROOF 
OF ELECTORAL FRAUD, THE GOVERNING PARTY WAS CONVINCED TO 
ACCEPT NEW ELECTIONS AS A MEANS FOR SETTLING THE MATTER. 
SINCE THEN, THE GOL HAS EMBARKED ON A COMPREHENSIVE 
REFORM PROGRAM FOR CIVIL SERVANTS, THE LDF AND OTHER 
SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS. THEIR GOAL IS TO MINIMIZE THE 
NEGATIVE EFFECT OF PARTISAN LOYALTIES IN THE PUBLIC AND 
SECURITY SERVICES WHILE PROMOTING A NON-PARTISAN 
MERITOCRACY FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS. THOSE SOLDIERS WHO WERE 
INVOLVED IN THE LDF MUTINY ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME BEING 
TRIED VIA COURTS-MARTIAL FOR THEIR PART IN THE ATTEMPTED 
COUP AND OTHER INFRACTIONS AGAINST THE DEFENSE ACT (1996). 
 
MUTINY WITHIN THE ARMY 
---------------------- 
 
9. OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES OPPOSED THE RESULTS OF 
THE 1998 GENERAL ELECTIONS -- AS HAS EVERY LOSING PARTY 
SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN 1966.  THEY CALLED FOR THE KING TO 
DISSOLVE THE GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW THAT THE KING 
DOES NOT HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO DO SO. 
WIDESPREAD DISTURBANCES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CAPITAL, LED 
TO A SOUTH AFRICAN EFFORT TO MEDIATE IN THE PROBLEM. A 
SOUTH AFRICAN-SPONSORED COMMISSION OF INQUIRY -- THE 
LANGA COMMISSION -- WAS CONVOKED TO LOOK INTO OPPOSITION 
ALLEGATIONS OF ELECTION FRAUD.  THE COMMISSION\'S 
FINDINGS, WERE LESS THAN UNAMBIGUOUS.  THE LANGA 
COMMISSION DID NOT FIND ANY PROOF OF ELECTORAL FRAUD, BUT 
SAID THEY COULD NOT PROVE THAT NO FRAUD AFFECTED 
ELECTORAL OUTCOMES.  CHOOSING TO INTERPRET THE AMBIGUITY 
OF THE LANGA REPORT AS A VICTORY, THE OPPOSITION PARTIES 
STRENGTHENED THEIR PROTESTS AND MADE THE COUNTRY 
UNGOVERNABLE. CABINET MINISTERS ABANDONED THEIR POSTS, 
WENT INTO HIDING AND THE CAPITAL WAS LITERALLY SHUT 
DOWN.  A HANDFUL OF LDF JUNIOR OFFICERS TOOK PART IN WHAT 
LATER LED TO A MUTINY.  ARMY OFFICERS ABOVE THE RANK OF 
CAPTAIN WERE ARRESTED AND HELD IN THE MAXIMUM SECURITY 
PRISON.  THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WAS FORCED TO READ AT 
GUNPOINT A STATEMENT OVER STATE RADIO CLAIMING HE FIRED 
28 OF HIS OFFICER COLLEAGUES AND SUBSEQUENTLY ANNOUNCED 
HIS OWN RESIGNATION. IN THE FOLLOWING DAYS, WITH THE ARMY 
IN MUTINY AND POLICE DISARMED, THE ONLY ORGANIZED ARMED 
FORCES IN THE COUNTRY WERE MUTINEERS AND OPPOSITION 
PROVOCATEURS.  THIS SITUATION BECAME UNTENABLE, AND 
MOTIVATED THE PM\'S REQUEST TO SADC FOR MILITARY 
INTERVENTION TO REVERSE THE MUTINY AND RETURN THE COUNTRY 
TO LAW AND ORDER. 
 
10. THE GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARKED ON A PROGRAM OF REFORM 
FOR THE LDF, THE POLICE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY SERVICE 
(NSS).  THE SADC INTERVENTION FORCES, KNOWN AS OPERATION 
BOLEAS, HAVE SINCE BEEN REPLACED BY OPERATION MALUTI 
WHICH IS AIMED AT RETRAINING AND REORIENTING THE LDF. 
THE SADC/LDF TRAINING IS REPORTED TO BE GOING WELL AND IT 
IS ENVISAGED THAT IT WILL BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE 
YEAR.  AN INITIAL PLAN TO DISBAND THE NSS -- AFTER IT 
FAILED TO INFORM THE GOVERNMENT OF THE OPPOSITION 
POLITICAL PARTIES\' PLAN TO STAGE A COUP -- WAS 
ABANDONED.  THIS DECISION FOLLOWED AN OUTCRY FROM MANY 
QUARTERS OF THE SOCIETY WORRIED THAT THE LCD MIGHT BE 
ENGAGED IN AN EFFORT TO TRANSFORM STATE EMPLOYEES INTO 
LCD PARTISANS. 
 
THE INTERIM POLITICAL AUTHORITY (IPA) 
------------------------------------- 
 
11. THE IPA WAS ESTABLISHED IN NOVEMBER 1998, TO PREPARE 
FOR EARLY ELECTIONS, AND WAS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE THE 
BASIS FOR A SOLUTION TO THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS IN 
LESOTHO.  THE IPA IS MADE UP OF TWO MEMBERS FROM EACH OF 
THE TWELVE POLITICAL PARTIES THAT TOOK PART IN THE 1998 
ELECTION.  THERE ARE 24 IPA MEMBERS, WHICH GIVES UNUSUAL 
VOTING STRENGTH TO THE OPPOSITION COALITION WHILE ALMOST 
ENSURING THE RULING PARTY\'S INITIATIVES NEVER CARRY THE 
CONSENSUS. THE IPA IS SUPPOSED TO SET THE STAGE FOR NEW 
ELECTIONS BY MAY 2000. THEY ARE TO AGREE AND MAKE 
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE NEXT ELECTION, 
ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE AUTONOMY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF 
THE INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL COMMISSION (IEC), AMONG OTHER 
MATTERS.  THE IPA\'S TENURE STATUTORILY ENDS AS SOON AS 
THE RESULTS OF 2000 ELECTIONS ARE ANNOUNCED. 
 
12. SOUTH AFRICAN MEDIATORS RECOMMENDED THE IPA AS A 
COMPROMISE METHOD TO ACCOMMODATE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE 
GOALS.  THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES WANTED A 
GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY (SOMEHOW WITHOUT THE 
PARTICIPATION OF THE RULING PARTY) BUT THE GOL OPPOSED 
THAT AFTER IT WON SUCH A RESOUNDING ELECTORAL VICTORY 
WITH SEVENTY NINE OF EIGHTY SEATS IN PARLIAMENT. 
(COMMENT: THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES CHOSE TO 
PORTRAY THE IPA AS A KIND OF POWER SHARING ARRANGEMENT OR 
PARALLEL/INTERIM GOVERNMENT.   HOWEVER, THE GOL, AS THE 
LEGITIMATELY ELECTED GOVERNMENT, REFUSES TO CEDE ANY OF 
ITS AUTHORITY TO THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE, BUT DOES 
PARTICIPATE IN THE IPA.  THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SADC 
VIEWS THE RULING PARTY AS THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT -- AS 
DOES THIS EMBASSY AND OTHER RESIDENT DIPLOMATIC 
MISSIONS.  NOR HAS COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF ELECTORAL FRAUD 
BEEN PRESENTED TO UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE 
MOSILILI ADMINISTRATION.  END COMMENT) 
 
PROGRESS, OR LACK THEREOF... 
-------------------------- 
 
13. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE IPA HAS COVERED LITTLE 
GROUND AND MADE MINISCULE PROGRESS IN PREPARING FOR NEW 
ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR. INTERMINABLE SQUABBLES BETWEEN THE 
RULING LESOTHO CONGRESS FOR DEMOCRACY (LCD) MEMBERS AND 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MAREMATLOU FREEDOM PARTY (MFP), 
THE BASOTHOLAND CONGRESS PARTY (BCP) AND THE BASOTHO 
NATIONAL PARTY (BNP) HAVE WASTED INVALUABLE TIME. 
POLITICIANS USED THE IPA AS A PLATFORM TO DENOUNCE ONE 
ANOTHER AND HOLD FORTH ON THE APPROPRIATENESS OF INVITING 
THE SADC FORCES TO INTERVENE IN THE POLITICAL AND 
MILITARY PROBLEMS OF LESOTHO. LITTLE WORK WAS 
ACCOMPLISHED ON ELECTIONS PREPARATION, THE IPA\'S MAIN 
DUTY.  ATTEMPTS BY OPPOSITION LEADERS TO DERAIL OR 
DISCREDIT COURT-MARTIAL HEARINGS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL 
WHO TOOK PART IN THE MUTINY ALSO OCCUPIED TOO MUCH OF THE 
IPA\'S WORKING TIME. (COMMENT: FROM 1970 TO 1993, 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES RULED LESOTHO, AND 
EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICES WAS DEPENDENT ON 
POLITICAL AFFILIATION WITH THE BNP.  AS A RESULT OF THE 
1993 ELECTION, THE THEN-BCP INHERITED A CIVIL SERVICE, AN 
ARMY, A POLICE FORCE, AND AN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE THAT 
WAS PROFOUNDLY POLARIZED IN PARTISAN OPPOSITION AGAINST 
THEM.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVED THAT OPPOSITION LEADERS 
WERE OPPOSED TO THE COURT-MARTIAL HEARINGS BECAUSE OF THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY AND THEIR SUPPORTERS COULD BE 
IMPLICATED IN SUBORNING MUTINY AS A PRELUDE TO AN ATTEMPT 
TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.  END COMMENT) 
 
14. DESPITE ITS LIMITED ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THE IPA MAY BE 
ON THE VERGE OF AGREEING TO ADD FIFTY SEATS TO THE 
CURRENT EIGHTY-MEMBER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY - FOR A TOTAL OF 
130 SEATS, WITH A PORTION OF THOSE SEATS CONTESTED ON A 
FIRST-PAST-THE-POST SYSTEM AND THE REMAINDER BY 
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION.  THIS OSTENSIBLE EFFORT AT 
REPRESENTATIONAL INCLUSIVENESS APPARENTLY SERVES THE 
INTERESTS OF OPPOSITION PARTIES MORE THAN IT DOES THE 
RULING PARTY. HOWEVER, IF VOTING PATTERNS REMAIN 
CONSISTENT WITH THE 1993 AND 1998 ELECTIONS, A NEW POLL 
MAY YET RATIFY THE VOTERS\' PREFERENCE FOR THE LCD OVER 
ALL OTHER PARTIES.  AFTER MUCH WRANGLING AND GOL 
ACQUIESCENCE, THE IPA HAS ALSO AGREED TO REPLACE THE 
CURRENT COMMISSIONERS OF THE INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION (IEC). AFTER FAILING TO SADDLE THE LCD WITH 
ACCUSATIONS OF ELECTORAL FRAUD, OPPOSITION POLITICAL 
PARTIES TURNED TO BLAME THEIR ELECTION DEFEAT ON THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE IEC, CLAIMING THAT HE WAS BRIBED. 
(COMMENT: THIS WAS THE FIRST IEC IN THE ELECTION HISTORY 
OF LESOTHO AND THE THREE COMMISSIONERS HAD NEVER HAD ANY 
EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING ELECTIONS.  THE THREE 
COMMISSIONERS WERE THE NOMINEES OF OPPOSITION PARTIES AND 
INITIALLY WERE DISTRUSTED BY THE LCD.  DESPITE THIS 
HANDICAP, AND LIMITED TIME TO ACHIEVE THEIR MANDATE, THE 
IEC WAS COMMENDED BY INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS REGIONAL 
ELECTION OBSERVER GROUPS FOR THEIR JOB OF CONDUCTING THE 
1998 ELECTIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, OPPOSITION MEMBERS OF THE 
IPA SAY THEY HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE IEC, SO THEIR 
SIX YEAR TERMS SHOULD BE TRUNCATED AND THEY SHOULD BE 
REPLACED.  IN CONTRAST, ELECTION OBSERVERS CONCLUDED THAT 
THE 1998 POLL MET INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR A 
DEMOCRATIC ELECTION THAT REFLECTED THE WILL OF THE 
ELECTORATE.  END COMMENT) 
 
15. THE CURRENT IMPASSE WITHIN THE IPA IS CENTERED ON THE 
PROPOSED MODEL FOR THE NEXT ELECTION.  THE RULING PARTY 
PREFERS TO RETAIN THE TRADITIONAL ELECTORAL SYSTEM OF 
FIRST PAST THE POST (FPTP) WHILE THE OPPOSITION PARTIES 
SEE THEIR ADVANTAGE IN A MIXED SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL 
REPRESENTATION (PR) AND A CONSTITUENCY BASED SYSTEM. 
(COMMENT: THERE IS A CYNICAL VIEW AMONG SOME BASOTHO THAT 
IT IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF ANY IPA MEMBERS TO SEE 
ELECTION PREPARATION SUCCEED BECAUSE THE IPA HAS BECOME A 
MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD FOR OPPOSITIONISTS, AND THE LCD IS 
ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS GOVERNING AUTHORITY WITHOUT 
INTERRUPTION OF ITS FIVE YEAR TENURE. END COMMENT).

SUBJECT: MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION INITIAL VISIT TO LESOTHO 
 
1. SUMMARY: The Millennium Challenge Corporation team of Clay 
Lowery, Tom Briggs and Wesley Wilson paid a very successful 
initial visit to Lesotho May 26-28.  Over the course of two and 
a half days, they met with the Prime Minister, nearly the entire 
Cabinet, almost all of the Principal Secretaries, 
representatives of international donors and the business, NGO 
and academic communities, and took a brief tour of the 
industrial areas around Maseru along with a bit of rural 
Lesotho.  The team concluded with a press conference for the 
local media.  Perhaps half of their interlocutors fully 
understood the radical departure from traditional foreign aid 
that the MCA represents.  Minister of Finance Tim Thahane, the 
GOL contact point for the MCA, expects to have Lesotho\'s 
proposal to the MCC by late August or early September.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. The Government of Lesotho enthusiastically welcomed the MCC 
team to the Mountain Kingdom.  Several of the key ministers, 
including Finance Minister Thahane and Foreign Minister Tsekoa, 
adjusted their travel schedules to return early from overseas to 
meet with the team.  The format of the meetings was essentially 
the same: the team briefly introduced the history and concept of 
the MCC (including the key fact that funding is not/not 
guaranteed), followed by questions and answers.  It was clear 
from the tenor of the comments and questions that about half of 
the interlocutors understood immediately how the MCC differed 
from other foreign aid programs.  Indeed, the most difficult 
concept for most to grasp was that the U.S. was not interested 
in dictating how the program would be run within Lesotho.  For 
many, used to donors telling them what they needed and how to do 
it, the guidance of \"make the case for how your program will aid 
economic growth\" was unsettlingly vague. 
 
3. Prime Minister Mosisili took the unusual step of inviting the 
team to meet with him in his offices.  Flanked by the Deputy 
Prime Minister and Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance, the 
PM welcomed the opportunity presented by the MCA and spoke in 
general terms about investing in infrastructure, health, 
education and agriculture.  He noted how \"demeaning\" it is to be 
forced to go to the international community for charity to feed 
his people, and thanked the U.S. for the chance to break the 
chains of dependency. 
 
4. At the reception for the team at the Ambassador\'s residence, 
Minister of Finance Thahane told the Ambassador that he planned 
to have a proposal ready for the MCC by late August or early 
September.  That would give the GOL time to hold the necessary 
consultations with the business, academic and NGO communities to 
produce a well conceived plan. 
 
5. COMMENT: The GOL will have two primary challenges in putting 
together a viable proposal for the MCC.  The first will be 
winnowing down all of the country\'s competing priorities into 
two or three key areas.  Thahane will have his hands full 
dissuading his colleagues from setting forth a shopping list of 
pet projects, and the Prime Minister may have to step in at the 
end.  The second will be to run a credible consultation process. 
 The academic community in particular was inclined to simply sit 
back and wait for the government to come to them (or for the 
Embassy to force the government into a specific model of 
consultation).  On a more encouraging note, however, the NGO 
representatives asked to continue using an embassy meeting room 
so that they could organize themselves on how they would 
interact with the government.  If nothing else, the MCC model 
may force a bit more initiative into the local psychology.  END 
COMMENT.

1. SUMMARY: Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) Paul Applegarth and other MCC officials 
visited Lesotho October 25-26 on a familiarization trip.  In an 
extremely busy 36 hours, Mr. Applegarth and his team met with a 
wide variety of government, private sector, NGO, and donor 
representatives, as well as making three site visits, including 
one for a project featured in the Compact proposal.   Ambassador 
Perry hosted private sector and NGO representatives as well as 
the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Tourism, Natural 
Resources and Agriculture at the CMR for receptions and luncheon 
discussions with the MCC team.   In addition, Embassy Maseru 
Pol/Econ and Public Diplomacy staff organized donor and public 
affairs events for the MCC/CEO and delegation members at the 
Chancery.   The Government of Lesotho held a final reception in 
honor of the CEO and his team.  Prior to the visit, the 
Ambassador, accompanied by DCM,  briefed key GOL officials 
(including the Prime Minister) on the familiarization rather 
than technical nature of the trip.  The Lesotho program 
accomplished the team\'s goals and provided a reciprocal benefit 
to government officials and others involved in Compact process, 
who had a much-appreciated opportunity to meet senior MCC 
leadership and learn more about the MCC\'s approach to evaluating 
proposals.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. On October 25-26, MCC/CEO Paul Applegarth visited Lesotho to 
learn more about potential partners here in an MCC Compact and 
to familiarize himself with the the overall economic and 
political environment.  Accompanying him were: John Hewko, MCC 
Vice President, Country Relations; Maureen Harrington, Senior 
Advisor; and Kristen Herring, Press Assistant.   (Note: Lesotho 
is one of the 16 countries declared eligible to compete for the 
USD 1 billion in MCC funds allocated for FY 2004.  The 
government submitted a draft Compact in late September, 
requesting a total of USD 254 million.  The purpose of the trip 
was not to provide detailed  technical feedback on the 
proposal.)  The team met with a wide variety of persons and 
organizations involved in drafting the Compact or with a strong 
interest in the MCC\'s final decision.  Activities included: 
 
Meetings with: 
 
Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili; 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Kenneth Tsekoa; 
Minister of Natural Resources (Mr.) Monyane Moleleki; 
Working breakfast  -- Home Affairs and Public Safety Tom Thabane; 
Chief Executive of the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority, 
(Mr.) E.L. Potloane; 
(Combined) the Cabinet MCA Sub-Committee, the Principal 
Secretaries\' Steering Committee, 
 
SIPDIS 
    and the technical working group; 
Donor community representatives. 
 
Other Events: 
 
Ambassador hosted CMR working lunch with NGO representatives; 
working lunch with Cabinet sub-committee, i.e., ministers of 
foreign affairs, finance and development planning, agriculture 
and food security, natural resources, and tourism, environment, 
and culture; and a reception for private sector representatives; 
Econ/Comm Assistant organized  site visits to Lesotho Flour 
Mills, (U.S. investment) and Global Textiles and Formosa 
Textiles  (AGOA-related investments) and a 
visit to proposed site of the Metolong Dam, featured in 
Lesotho\'s MCC proposal; and, 
Public Diplomacy Officer hosted Press event for local media. 
 
Ambassador Perry and DCM Albrecht accompanied the team on all 
meetings/events.  In addition, Public Diplomacy (PD)  Officer 
Dornburg, GSO Blosser, and Econ/Commercial Assistant Akhionbare 
participated in most activities as did PD Assistant Nthejane. 
 
-------------------------- 
Meeting with MFA 
-------------------------- 
 
3. Mr. Applegarth\'s visit began with a call on MFA Tsekoa.   The 
CEO stressed, as he did in all subsequent conversations, that 
the purpose of the visit was familiarization with those 
individuals and groups involved in drafting the Compact, i.e., 
the potential partners with the MCC, should a final agreement be 
reached.   The team would not and could not provide detailed 
feedback on the recently-submitted draft Compact.   In response, 
Tsekoa noted the wide-ranging participation in the drafting 
 
SIPDIS 
process both within and outside of the government which had 
resulted in a strong sense of \"ownership\" of the proposal. 
Priorities (development of water resources, agriculture, 
industrialization, tourism, and institutional capacity building) 
had been selected carefully.   Another strong plus for Lesotho 
was its continuing progress on democratization: free and fair 
national elections in 2002, upcoming local elections (note: 
planned for sometime before March 31, 2005, but no specific date 
has been announced, end note) and the country\'s participation in 
the AU African Peer Review Mechanism.

4.  Describing the Compact as \"thoughtful and comprehensive,\" 
Mr. Applegarth said he hoped to get a better understanding of 
the proposal\'s implementation and its links to poverty reduction 
and employment creation.   He added that the MCC is preparing to 
select eligible countries for 2005 and Lesotho is a candidate. 
In response to a question from Tsekoa, he reassured the MFA that 
eligibility in 2004 would not reduce a country\'s chances for 
2005.  Lesotho, in fact, does well under the two changed 
eligibility criteria: reduction in the inflation rate ceiling 
from 20 to 15 per cent and female, as opposed to overall, 
primary school completion rate. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
NGO\'s Provide Their Views 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. At the Ambassador\'s lunch with representatives of the NGO 
community, CEO Applegarth solicited views about the consultation 
process regarding the Compact and the proposal\'s priorities. 
NGO\'s generally thought the consultations had been open and 
genuine, with civil society\'s views receiving due consideration. 
  There was some disagreement on priorities.  The proposed ski 
resort, for example, did not match the Millennium Challenge 
Account (MCA) Tourism Task Force\'s recommendation to develop 
eco-tourism.  A CARE employee and a local consultant questioned 
how much the population would benefit from the three proposed 
dam projects in the Compact.  A representative from Habitat for 
Humanity raised the long-standing problem of land tenure -- the 
current system prevents owners from having clear title.  The 
Lesotho Council of NGO\'s noted that statistics in Lesotho are 
often unreliable -- to which Applegarth commented that data 
collection may need to be a part of the first state of any 
implementation plan.  He encouraged NGO\'s to remain engaged in 
the consultations process, wich would continue as part of 
efforts to develop an implementable Compact.

Cabinet Sub-Committee, PS Steering Committee and Others 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  At the Prime Minister\'s request, the GOL arranged a combined 
meeting for the team with the Cabinet MCA Sub-Committee 
(ministers of foreign affairs, finance and development, 
agriculture and food security, and tourism, environment, and 
culture), the Principal Secretary Steering Committee (members 
from the same ministries as the Cabinet group), and 
representatives of the technical working group, which included 
NGO and private sector officials.   Minister of Finance Thahane 
noted that groups involved in creating the Vision 2020 national 
plan and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper also worked on the 
MCA document.  The Minister made four major points: 
 
1) The proposal\'s formulation was inclusive and would continue 
to be so. 
2) The private sector should be the engine of development, 
requiring the government to create an attractive business 
environment; government would engage the private sector on how 
to create such an environment and what sectors are best for 
development. 
3) The government is addressing the need to improve 
administrative and financial management.  4) Development in 
Lesotho should be based on the resources available: people and 
water. 
 
7. Applegarth described MCA as part of the overall USG approach 
to development, which consists of trade, debt relief, and 
development aid.  MCA is an investment of U.S. taxpayer money in 
poverty reduction and economic growth, based on a partnership 
model.  By 2006, MCA would be the largest U.S. aid program since 
the Marshall Plan, assuming full funding.   Turning to Lesotho\'s 
proposal, he described the document as \"thoughtful,\" and based 
on the resources available in the country.  The consultative 
process seemed to be appropriately inclusive. 
 
8. Discussion then focused various aspects of the proposed 
Compact.   In response to questions about when a proposal might 
be approved, Applegarth declined to be specific, but said he 
would be disappointed if nothing was in place by the middle of 
next year.   To help move things along, he suggested that those 
responsible for the Compact consider: phased-in implementation; 
other funding sources, as MCA would assist other donors; 
implementation by non-government entities; and what types of 
policies require assistance that MCA could provide.  Hewko 
stressed the importance of measurable results, tangible outcomes 
that do not involve merely materials or equipment. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Minister of Natural Resources 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9. Minister Moleleki concentrated on describing the Metolong Dam 
project featured in the Compact.  Lesotho is requesting USD 43 
 
MASERU 00000598  003.2 OF 005 
 
 
million from MCC for the USD 115 million total project intended 
to provide water for residential and industrial use in the 
greater Maseru area.   Metolong is a fast-track project; 
according to the Minister; ground-breaking could occur in June 
of July of 2005, if funding is available soon.  (Note: an 
environmental impact assessment, however, remains to be done.) 
 
----------------------------------- 
LHDA Director Potloane 
----------------------------------- 
 
10. The MCC team met with Potloane to see what lessons learned 
from the Lesotho Highlands Water Project might apply to the 
water projects proposed in the Compact.  (Note: the LHWP 
currently consists of two dams in central Lesotho which supply 
water to South Africa, generating between USD 2 to 2.5 million 
per month in revenue, at current rates, and generating all of 
the electricity requirements for the national grid.  Proposed 
additional dams are underoing feasibility studies.)   Potloane 
felt that the management and engineering skills developed among 
Basotho during the design and construction of LHWP would be used 
on the lowlands projects in the Compact.   While he praised the 
overall proposal, Potloane stated several areas needed further 
attention: a suitable organizational structure for water 
distribution; improved water resource management legislation; 
and careful selection of funding sources (South Africa covered 
90 per cent of the cost of the LHWP). 
 
--------------- 
Site Visits 
--------------- 
 
11.  The team visited Lesotho Flour Mills, 50 per cent owned by 
U.S. company Seaboard Corporation and the only significant U.S. 
investment in Lesotho, as well as Global Garments and Formosa 
Textiles, two Taiwan-owned AGOA-based enterprises.  At the flour 
mill, Acting Managing Director Daniel Awani (who previously 
managed some Seaboard operations in West Africa) described the 
business environment in Lesotho, both in general and 
sector-specific terms.  Some of the problems he cited result 
from Lesotho\'s situation as a landlocked country within a 
country with a stronger economy.  For example, the mill imports 
90 per cent of its raw materials by rail through South Africa. 
Although the company is situated within easy reach of the grain 
producing area of South Africa, the rail system in South Africa 
is not reticulated in a manner that allows the mill to take 
advantage of proximity to surrounding farms.  He said such 
difficulties could be resolved through the rationalization of 
transport routes by the Lesotho and South African governments. 
Processing procedures at the South Africa - Lesotho border are 
slow and should be streamlined. 
 
12.  Regarding labor, the mill is able to attract good quality 
workers in Lesotho, but faces stiff competition from South 
Africa, which offers much higher salaries. The laws governing 
employment in Lesotho tend to be overprotective towards workers, 
leading to protracted litigation which impacts on swift 
disciplinary action by employers.  Lesotho banks operate against 
lending ceilings that are below the requirements of large 
operators like the mill.  The government bureaucracy governing 
licenses, work permits etc. tends to be slow, but the mill has 
not detected any corruption in its dealings with the 
authorities.  Similarly, the company felt that the court systems 
operates in a transparent and fair manner. 
 
13. Global Garments is one of three factories owned by Nien 
Hsing, a Taiwan-based investor.  It manufactures denim garments 
for export to major United States retailers such as the GAP, 
including Old Navy, and Walmart.  Global has been operating for 
the past eighteen months, and employs 2,500 workers. The company 
currently imports fabric from the Far East, but will start using 
cloth from Formosa Textiles, a sister fabric mill based in 
Maseru.  Nien Hsing operations in Lesotho employ a total of 
9,000 workers including those at Formosa as well as another 
production site.  Factory management felt the government has 
generally been helpful in meeting it needs, e.g., 
infrastructure, water supply, etc., although the electrical 
supply is unstable at times.   Formosa is operating at 
significantly below capacity, due, its owners claim, to the 
extension of the AGOA third country fabric provision which 
allows clothing makers to continue importation of inexpensive 
fabric from Asia. 
 
14. The proposed site for the Metolong dam lies about 35 
kilometers east of Maseru.  Representatives of the Ministry of 
Natural Resources and the Water and Sewage Authority who 
accompanied the team stressed the minimal disruption of the 
project to the surrounding area.  No villages would need to be 
relocated and the water level would not flood existing fields. 
When filled, the dam would meet the anticipated needs of the 
Maseru area and still have ample spare capacity.

Lunch with Cabinet MCA Sub-Committee 
 
MASERU 00000598  004.2 OF 005 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
15.  At a lunch hosted by the Ambassador, MFA Tsekoa 
acknowledged the need to delineate priorities and phases in 
Lesotho\'s proposal.  CEO Applegarth commended Lesotho\'s culture 
of openness and transparency described by various 
persons/organizations the team had already met.  He encouraged 
consideration of an expanded resource model in Lesotho to 
include highland water, Basotho people, the NGO community, 
private sector, and donor organizations.  Minister of Finance 
Thahane expressed concern about the withdrawal of training by 
cooperative partners in the U.S. over the past 10 years.  He 
underlined the ambiguity of the term \"capacity building\" and 
called for integration of specific skills development into the 
proposal.  Despite admitted frustration at \"talent poaching\" by 
South Africa, Ministers Phororo (Agriculture) and Mololeki 
(Natural Resources) suggested resurrecting agro-economic, 
management, and financial exchange opportunities such as the 
former programs with Washington State University and the state 
of Colorado.  The ministers also illuminated for the MCC team 
the nuanced displacement of highland for lowland Basotho values, 
or a cattle-as-collateral to cattle-as-commodity shift amidst 
increased stock theft and land use disputes.  There remains some 
sentiment for eventual development of tourist sites as noted by 
Minister Nts\'inyi who also commented on the recent international 
tourism conference she attended in Washington, D.C. The 
Government of Lesotho as a whole is eager for feedback on a 
proposed Compact and for the next MCC team visit. 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Meeting with Donors and Press Event 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
16.  At the meeting with approximately 20 representatives of the 
donor community, Applegarth outlined the basics of Lesotho\'s 
proposed Compact.  (Knowledge of the proposal among the donors 
varied considerably.)   He stressed that MCA is an addition to 
the other donor initiatives.  MCC would be happy to collaborate 
with other donors in worthwhile projects planned or underway. 
He added that the consultative process seemes to have been valid 
and genuine.  Donors commented that the consultations required 
by MCA had significantly improved intra-governmental 
communication and the GOL\'s outreach to other sectors.  One of 
the most experienced diplomatic representatives added that the 
current environment is the best ever for getting a return on 
one\'s investment in development.  This event, held at the 
Embassy, was followed by a press conference covered by national 
television and print media including the country\'s leading news 
magazine. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Meeting with Prime Minister 
---------------------------------------- 
 
17.  PM Mosisili praised the MCA as holding out great potential 
for Lesotho.  MCA is one of numerous USG initiatives (e.g., 
AGOA)  that engage and involve the beneficiary country and, in 
the process, gain the support of the general population. 
Lesotho\'s progress in democratization has opened up society, he 
added; the successful 2002 elections brought a peaceful 
post-election period for the first time in the country\'s 
history.  This provides an opportunity to tackle development 
issues.   In that regard, the Compact\'s priority on building the 
water sector is appropriate.  The LHWP is a good example of how 
the country can benefit from exploiting its water resources. 
Mosisili agreed with Applegarth\'s suggestion about the need for 
all parties involved in the Compact to consider implementation 
options, refine indicators of success, and continue to work on 
policy developmenmt.  He volunteered that the time required to 
start a business in Lesotho (an indicator where Lesotho ranks 
below the median among MCA eligible countries) must be reduced. 
 Regardless of these issues, the Prime Minister concluded, 
Lesotho would continue to provide its people and investors 
honest government and respect for human rights.  During the 
GOL\'s Oct 26 reception, the finance Minister reiterated 
Lesotho\'s gratitude for the visit and the opportunity to 
exchange views with the team. 
 
 
18. COMMENT:  Although the team\'s actual time in Lesotho 
amounted to little more than 36 hours, the visit accomplished 
its objectives.   The wide range of meeting and other activities 
familiarized CEO Applegarth and his colleagues with the 
potential partners in an MCC Compact and with the general 
political and economic environment.   From the perspective of 
the partners, the familiarization was reciprocal.  Meeting top 
level MCC officials provided a greater understanding of the 
organization\'s focus and direction, as well as the general 
Compact evaluation process.  The hosts would have appreciated 
more feedback on the proposed Compact, which was not possible at 
this time.  Their eagerness for MCC\'s reaction and receptivity 
to Applegarth\'s suggestions for work to be done in the interim 
 
MASERU 00000598  005.2 OF 005 
 
 
underscored the commitment of Lesotho to the MCA process.  We 
believe the GOL would work closely with any future MCA technical 
teams to refine proposed projects and would insure continued 
dialogue with the multiple constituencies engaged to date.
