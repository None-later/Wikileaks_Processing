1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  EMBOFF CALLED AUGUST 8 ON TAHSIN BURCUOGLU (PROTECT), 
COUNSELOR (AND THIRD RANKING OFFICER) AT THE TURKISH 
EMBASSY IN SOFIA, TO SEEK CONFIRMATION OF AND 
ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON A REPORTED RECENT ROUND-UP AND 
ARREST OF ETHNIC-TURKISH BULGARIANS (REF A).  WITHOUT 
REFERENCE TO REF A REPORT, EMBOFF STEERED DISCUSSION OF 
OTHER TOPICS (SEPTELS) AROUND TO WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN 
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN RECENT WEEKS REGARDING 
BULGARIAN TURKS.  IN HIS RESPONSE, BURCUOGLU MADE NO 
REFERENCE TO A SUDDEN WAVE OF ARRESTS. 
- 
3.  IN FURTHER CONVERSATION, BURCUOGLU DID REFER TO 
BULGARIAN TURKS RECENTLY RELEASED FROM BELENE ISLAND 
PRISON AND THEN EXILED TO KYUSTENDIL AND VRATSA 
(EVIDENTLY THE CASES ALSO MENTIONED BY SOURCE OF REF A).

HE SAID THAT NO SPECIFIC TERM OF YEARS FOR SUCH EXILE 
HAD BEEN STATED. IN ENSUING DISCUSSION OF WHETHER BULGARIA 
WAS PURSUING A POLICY OF RESETTLING SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS 
OF ETHNIC TURKS, BURCUOGLU INDICATED HIS BELIEF THAT 
SUCH FORCED RESETTLEMENTS ON A LIMITED SCALE HAD BEEN 
CARRIED OUT SINCE EVEN BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE 
1984-85 NAME-CHANGING CAMPAIGN.  HE SAID THAT ON A 1985 
TRIP TO VELIKO TURNOVO, HE WAS TOLD BY ETHNIC TURKISH 
CONTACTS THAT TWO HUNDRED FAMILIES (PROBABLY 800-1000 
PEOPLE) HAD BEEN UPROOTED FROM THE TURKISH QUARTER OF 
THAT CITY AND RESETTLED ELSEWHERE.  HE HAD BEEN SHOWN 
THE VACANT HOUSES OF SOME OF THE FAMILIES INVOLVED. 
HE ALSO REFERRED TO A MORE RECENT CASE OF A YOUNG ETHNIC 
TURK WHO, ALONG WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS, WAS FORCIBLY 
RESETTLED FROM THE PLOVDIV AREA AFTER ATTEMPTING TO 
CONTACT THE TURKISH CONSULATE IN PLOVDIV. 
- 
4.  COMMENT.  THIS EMBASSY\'S DIRECT CONTACT WITH 
ETHNIC TURKS WORKING INVOLUNTARILY OUTSIDE THEIR PLACE 
OF ORIGIN REMAINS LIMITED TO TWO CASES (REF B).  THUS 
ALTHOUGH A POLICY OF RESETTLING ETHNIC TURKS, ESPECIALLY 
\"TROUBLE-MAKERS,\" IS PLAUSIBLE AND WAS INDEED 
THREATENED IN A 1985 INTERVIEW GIVEN BY BULGARIAN 
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CHAIRMAN ANGEL BALEVSKI, WE CANNOT 
YET CONFIRM THAT SUCH A POLICY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED 
IN MORE THAN POSSIBLY ISOLATED CASES.  A CURRENT SERIES 
OF TRIPS BY EMBOFFS TO \"NON-TURKISH\" REGIONS OF 
BULGARIA MAY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO INQUIRE WHETHER 
ANY MOVEMENT OF ETHNIC TURKS HAS OCCURRED. 
 
5.  BIO NOTE:  BURCUOGLU APPEARS TO BE IN HIS FORTIES 
AND SPEAKS GOOD, ALTHOUGH OCCASIONALLY LABORED, ENGLISH. 
HE MENTIONED THAT, DURING A PREVIOUS TOUR OF DUTY IN

3.(C)  HERE FOLLOWS THE MAKE-UP OF THE BSP-PROPOSED 
CABINET, WITH BRIEF BIO DATA ON EACH MINISTER. 
 
ZHAN VIDENOV -- PRIME MINISTER.  THE PRAGMATIC BSP 
CHAIRMAN SINCE 1991, VIDENOV HAS INCREASINGLY ASSERTED 
HIS INDEPENDENCE FROM HARDLINE AND REFORM WINGS OF THE 
BSP.  THE RESIDENT WORLD BANK REP CONSIDERS HIM TO BE 
\"SOMEONE THE BANK CAN WORK WITH.\"  BORN 3/22/59, VIDENOV 
IS THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF THE CABINET.  HE SPEAKS 
ENGLISH, RUSSIAN, ARABIC AND SOME FRENCH. 
 
DONCHO KONAKCHIEV -- FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND 
MINISTER FOR TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION. 
A CLOSE VIDENOV CONFIDANT, KONAKCHIEV MADE AN 
UNSUCCESSFUL BID TO BE MAYOR OF SOFIA.  BORN 3/17/43. 
 
KIRIL TSOCHEV -- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER OF 
TRADE AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION.  TSOCHEV RETURNS TO THE 
POST HE HELD FOR SIX MONTHS IN 1994 UNDER THE GOVERNMENT 
OF P.M. LYUBEN BEROV.  A PRAGMATIC TECHNOCRAT, TSOCHEV 
CONDUCTED AN OPEN-DOOR POLICY TO THE U.S. DURING HIS 
TENURE, ALTHOUGH HE HAD LIMITED INFLUENCE AND IS NOT 
EXPECTED TO BE A HEAVYWEIGHT IN VIDENOV\'S GOVERNMENT. 
HE IS RUMORED TO BE CLOSE TO ANDREI LUKANOV, A POWERFUL 
BEHIND-THE-SCENES LEADER IN THE BSP.  BORN 4/4/47, 
TSOCHEV SPEAKS ENGLISH AND RUSSIAN. 
 
RUMEN GECHEV -- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FOR ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT.  A RISING STAR IN THE BSP, GECHEV WILL BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, INVESTMENTS AND 
PRIVATIZATION.  A PROPONENT OF STATE SUBSIDIES TO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

INCREASE PRODUCTION, GECHEV WAS A FULBRIGHTER IN 
ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS FROM 1987-88. 
BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE EXPERIENCE DID LITTLE TO ENLIGHTEN 
HIS VIEWS ON ECONOMICS.  BORN 10/4/56, HE SPEAKS ENGLISH 
AND RUSSIAN. 
 
SVETOSLAV SHIVAROV -- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER WITHOUT 
PORTFOLIO.  SHIVAROV, WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF THE BSP 
COALITION PARTNER, THE ALEXANDER STAMBOLIYSKI AGRARIAN 
PARTY, OWES HIS NEWLY-CREATED JOB TO A PRE-ELECTION 
AGREEMENT.  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT SHIVAROV\'S ROLE WILL 
BE.  HE IS A LAWYER BY TRAINING, BORN IN 2/7/44. 
 
GEORGI PIRINSKI -- MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
PIRINSKI, WHO SERVED AS A DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER UNDER 
THE BSP GOVERNMENT OF ANDREI LUKANOV IN 1991, IS A 
MEMBER OF THE BSP\'S REFORMIST \"SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC\" WING. 
A POLISHED DIPLOMAT, HE WILL PROMOTE BULGARIA\'S 
CONTINUED INTEGRATION WITH EUROPE, BUT IS NOT PRO-NATO-- 
ACCORDING TO THE PRESS, HE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY CHOSEN OVER 
FELLOW-REFORMIST PHILIP BOKOV BECAUSE OF THE LATTER\'S 
PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR BULGARIAN MEMBERSHIP IN NATO.  BORN

9/10/48 IN NEW YORK, PIRINSKI\'S FATHER WAS DEPORTED IN 
THE 1950\'S FOR COMMUNIST ACTIVITY AND THE ENTIRE FAMILY 
MOVED TO BULGARIA.  HE IS NOT A U.S. CITIZEN.  HE SPEAKS 
ENGLISH, FRENCH AND RUSSIAN.  HE IS CONSIDERED TO BE

ESPECIALLY CLOSE TO ANDREI LUKANOV.  THIS APPOINTMENT 
WAS A SURPRISE IN THAT PIRINSKI HAS A VERY STRONG 
ECONOMIC FOUNDATION AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT IF HE GOT 
AN APPOINTMENT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT AREA. 
 
DIMITUR PAVLOV -- MINISTER OF DEFENSE.  A RETIRED 
ADMIRAL SINCE 1993 AND FORMER NAVAL CHIEF OF STAFF, 
PETROV HAS BEEN DEPUTY MINDEF UNDER THE LAST TWO 
GOVERNMENTS AND HAS CLOSE TIES TO THE BSP.  HE HAS 
VISITED THE U.S. AND SEEKS GOOD RELATIONS WITH WESTERN 
MILITARIES.  BORN 9/7/37, HE SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND 
UNDERSTANDS SOME ENGLISH. 
 
DIMITUR KOSTOV -- MINISTER OF FINANCE.  KOSTOV HAS BEEN 
FIRST DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER SINCE 1992, IS NOT A BSP 
MEMBER, AND IS REPORTED TO BE THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT WITHIN 
THE MINISTRY.  HIS SELECTION FOR WHAT MAY BE THE MOST 
CRITICAL MINISTRY IN THE NEXT GOVERNMENT SIGNALS A 
WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF THE BSP TO WORK WITH THE 
IFI\'S, TO WHOM KOSTOV IS WELL AND FAVORABLY KNOWN-- 
ALTHOUGH HIS NON-PARTY STATUS ALSO MAKES KOSTOV 
EXPENDABLE IF THE GOING GETS ROUGH.  KOSTOV SPENT A YEAR 
IN THE U.S. AND IS CLOSE TO THE UDF, BULGARIA\'S 
OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC COALITION.  HE WAS BORN 9/21/57. 
 
LYUBOMIR NACHEV -- MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR.  A FORMER 
BSP M.P. WHOSE BACKGROUND AS A CRIMINOLOGIST IN THIS 
MINISTRY PORTENDS A HALT TO THE MODEST REFORMS 
UNDERTAKEN TO DATE IN THIS KEY MINISTRY.  BORN 10/22/54. 
 
MLADEN CHERVENYAKOV -- MINISTER OF JUSTICE. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

CHERVENYAKOV WAS ONE OF THE BSP REPRESENTATIVES TO THE 
NATIONAL ELECTION COMMISSION THAT OVERSAW THE 1994 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  A LAWYER AND FORMER 
PROSECUTOR, HE WAS BORN 8/22/54 AND SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND 
ENGLISH. 
 
VASIL CHICHIBABA -- MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE. 
CHICHIBABA\'S CANDIDACY WAS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF ALL 
THOSE PROPOSED BY VIDENOV.  ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, 
BSP\'ERS CRITICIZED HIS LACK OF PERSPECTIVE TO MANAGE 
NATIONAL POLICY.  A MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT BSP 
HARDLINERS HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN CHICHIBABA\'S STRONG 
SUPPORT FOR REFORMS WITHIN THE NATIONAL AGRARIAN ACADEMY 
IN 1992.  CHICHIBABA, WHO IS A LONGTIME MEMBER OF 
SHIVAROV\'S ALEXANDER STAMBOLIYSKI AGRARIANS, OWES HIS 
JOB TO A PRE-ELECTION UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AGRARIANS 
WOULD GET THIS MINISTRY. 
 
KLIMENT VUCHEV -- MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY.  VUCHEV 
REPRESENTS BULGARIA\'S MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. 
DIRECTOR OF THE MILITARY ELECTRONIC PRODUCER \"ELECTRON\" 
AND A FORMER MIDDLE MANAGER IN \"METALCHIM\" HOLDING, 
WHICH CONTROLS THE SPRAWLING VASOV MACHINE 
TOOL/AMMUNITION PLANT COMPLEX IN SOPOT.  HIS SELECTION 
INDICATES CLEARLY THE BSP\'S INTENTION TO REVIVE 
BULGARIA\'S MILITARY INDUSTRIES.  BORN 10/30/37. 
 
ILCHO IVANOV DIMITROV --  MINISTER OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE 
AND TECHNOLOGY.  THE MOST RETROGRADE OF ALL VIDENOV\'S 
APPOINTMENTS, DIMITROV WAS MINISTER EDUCATION UNDER 
TODOR ZHIVKOV, COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY AND, LATER, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

RECTOR OF SOFIA UNIVERSITY AND A MARXIST HISTORIAN.

MINCHO KORALSKI -- MINISTER OF LABOR AND SOCIAL 
AFFAIRS.  A DEPUTY MINISTER FOR THESE ISSUES UNDER THREE 
DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS BETWEEN 1990-92, KORALSKI IS 
REPOREDLY VERY CLOSE TO VALENTIN MOLLOV, A MEDIA MAGNATE 
AND MEMBER OF THE SO-CALLED \"G-13\" GROUP OF PRIVATE 
INDUSTRIALISTS WHO CONTROL LARGE SEGMENTS OF THE 
ECONOMY.  HE WAS BORN 9/5/51. 
 
MIMI VITKOVA -- MINISTER OF HEALTH.  A BSP DEPUTY IN THE 
LAST THREE PARLIAMENTS, VITKOVA IS A CARDIOLOGIST AND 
OUTSPOKEN OPPONENT OF PRIVATE MEDICAL PRACTICES.  SHE 
SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH AND WAS BORN 11/21/50. 
 
STAMEN STAMENOV -- MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION.  STAMENOV 
WAS APPOINTED HEAD OF BULGARIAN STATE RAILWAYS IN JUNE 
1994 FOLLOWING THE FIRING OF HIS PREDECESSOR FOR, AMONG 
OTHER OFFENSES, PERMITTING MASSIVE VIOLATIONS OF THE 
EMBARGO AGAINST SERBIA.  STAMENOV, BORN 7/7/38, HAS OVER

INEVITABLY, THERE WILL BE FRICTION WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, 
IFI OR EU ECONOMIC OBLIGATIONS CLASH WITH BSP PROMISES 
TO RAISE PENSIONS, CONTROL PRICES, AND SUBSIDIZE STATE 
ENTERPRISES.  WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IS WHETHER VIDENOV 
WILL TAKE HIS CUE FROM THOSE MINISTERS CONVINCED OF THE 
NEED FOR COOPERATION WITH THE IFI\'S AND INTEGRATION WITH 
THE WEST, OR FROM THE MORE NUMEROUS HARDLINERS IN HIS

TENURE, ALTHOUGH HE HAD LIMITED INFLUENCE AND IS NOT

1.(C)  ON JANUARY 22, THE BULGARIAN SOCIALIST PARTY 
(BSP) APPROVED A PROPOSED 18-MEMBER CABINET TO BE HEADED 
BY BSP CHAIRMAN ZHAN VIDENOV.  PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL IS 
EXPECTED BY THE END OF THE WEEK.  ON THE ONE HAND, THE

THE MINISTRIES OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS, LABOR, INDUSTRY AND

BEST NEWS IS THAT IT CLEARLY SIGNALS A DESIRE TO WORK 
WITH THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND 
THEREFORE TO CONTINUE A PATH OF ECONOMIC REFORM.  THE 
CHALLENGE FOR THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE TO DO SO AND AT THE 
SAME TIME TO SATISFY THE GREATLY-RAISED EXPECTATIONS OF

MILITARIES.  BORN 9/7/37, HE SPEAKS RUSSIAN AND

DIMITUR KOSTOV -- MINISTER OF FINANCE.  KOSTOV HAS BEEN 
FIRST DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER SINCE 1992, IS NOT A BSP 
MEMBER, AND IS REPORTED TO BE THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT WITHIN 
THE MINISTRY.  HIS SELECTION FOR WHAT MAY BE THE MOST 
CRITICAL MINISTRY IN THE NEXT GOVERNMENT SIGNALS A 
WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF THE BSP TO WORK WITH THE 
IFI\'S, TO WHOM KOSTOV IS WELL AND FAVORABLY KNOWN-- 
ALTHOUGH HIS NON-PARTY STATUS ALSO MAKES KOSTOV

CHICHIBABA\'S CANDIDACY WAS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF ALL 
THOSE PROPOSED BY VIDENOV.  ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, 
BSP\'ERS CRITICIZED HIS LACK OF PERSPECTIVE TO MANAGE 
NATIONAL POLICY.  A MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT BSP 
HARDLINERS HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN CHICHIBABA\'S STRONG 
SUPPORT FOR REFORMS WITHIN THE NATIONAL AGRARIAN ACADEMY 
IN 1992.  CHICHIBABA, WHO IS A LONGTIME MEMBER OF 
SHIVAROV\'S ALEXANDER STAMBOLIYSKI AGRARIANS, OWES HIS

IS NOT VERY INSPIRING; NOR, HOWEVER, IS IT THE DOOMSDAY 
LIST SOME OBSERVERS FEARED.  ON BALANCE, THE COMPOSITION 
REFLECTS THE SUPREMACY OF BSP HARDLINERS IN VIRTUALLY 
ALL BUT THE KEY MINISTRIES CONCERNED WITH BULGARIA\'S 
EXTERNAL RELATIONS WITH EUROPE, THE WEST AND THE IFI\'S. 
INEVITABLY, THERE WILL BE FRICTION WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, 
IFI OR EU ECONOMIC OBLIGATIONS CLASH WITH BSP PROMISES 
TO RAISE PENSIONS, CONTROL PRICES, AND SUBSIDIZE STATE 
ENTERPRISES.  WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IS WHETHER VIDENOV 
WILL TAKE HIS CUE FROM THOSE MINISTERS CONVINCED OF THE 
NEED FOR COOPERATION WITH THE IFI\'S AND INTEGRATION WITH 
THE WEST, OR FROM THE MORE NUMEROUS HARDLINERS IN HIS 
CABINET WHO SEEK INSTEAD A RETURN TO STATIST ECONOMIC 
POLICIES.  END COMMENT.  MONTGOMERY

UDF LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS, CONVERSION TO A PARTY 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
3.(C)  THE FEB. 15-16 NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF BULGARIA\'S 
UNION OF DENOCRATIC FORCES (BULGARIA\'S LARGEST 
OPPOSITION FORCE WHILE THE SOCIALIST PARTY WAS IN OFFICE 
THESE LAST TWO YEARS) WAS A WELL-PLANNED AND 
WELL-ORCHESTRATED EVENT.  OVER 4000 UDF DELEGATES 
ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSED THE POLITICAL AGENDA OF UDF 
CHAIRMAN IVAN KOSTOV AND RE-ELECTED HIM AND THE REST OF 
THE UDF LEADERSHIP.  STILL RADIANT FROM THE OVERWHELMING 
NOV. 3 ELECTORAL VICTORY OF THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PETAR STOYANOV, A MONTH OF SUCCESSFUL PROTESTS AGAINST A 
SECOND SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT, AND THE SCHEDULING OF 
PRE-TERM PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, UDF CONFERENCE 
DELEGATES GAVE HEARTY SUPPORT TO THEIR EXECUTIVE 
COUNCIL\'S CALL FOR UDF UNIFICATION INTO A SINGLE PARTY. 
WHEREAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO A SUBSTANTIAL MINORITY 
QUESTIONED KOSTOV\'S LEADERSHIP AND PARTICULARLY HIS 
EFFORTS TO NEGOTIATE WITH MORE MODERATE SOCIALIST 
DEPUTIES, NOW THE UDF LEADERSHIP COULD DO NO WRONG. 
 
4.(U)  THE DELEGATES READILY VOTED TO ACCEPT NEW 
STATUTES UNIFYING THE UDF\'S 15 CONSTITUENT PARTIES INTO 
A SINGLE POLITICAL PARTY, ELIMINATING THE UDF NATIONAL 
COORDINATING COUNCIL, TRANSFERRING ITS RESPONSIBILITIES 
TO THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (NEC), AND EXPANDING 
MEMBERSHIP OF THE NEC FROM SEVEN MEMBERS TO ELEVEN. 
(COMMENT:  THE CUMBERSOME AND QUARRELSOME NATIONAL 
COORDINATING COUNCIL GAVE UNDUE WEIGHT TO SOME OF THE 
MINUTE PARTIES THAT MADE UP THE UDF COALITION.  THE 
COUNCIL HAD COMPRISED 139 MEMBERS:  3 FROM EACH OF THE 
MEMBER PARTIES, 59 MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, 7 MEMBERS OF 
THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, AND 28 UDF REGIONAL 
COUNCIL CHIEFS.) 
 
5.(U)  KOSTOV RAN UNOPPOSED FOR PARTY CHAIRMAN AND WAS 
RE-ELECTED BY A SHOW OF HANDS.  LAWYER MP HRISTO

COMMENT 
------- 
10.(C)  THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND UNIFYING THE UDF WAS 
ITS CHAIRMAN IVAN KOSTOV, WHO HAD FOR MONTHS ADVOCATED 
FORMATION OF A SINGLE PARTY PRIOR TO PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS.  AMONG OTHER REASONS, KOSTOV WANTED TO FORM A 
SINGLE UNIFIED PARTY SO THAT HE WOULD NOT BE FACED WITH 
CONFLICTING MINISTERIAL PORTFOLIO DEMANDS FROM 15 UDF 
MEMBER PARTIES (MANY TINY AND THIN ON EXPERTISE) IF THE 
UDF CAME TO POWER.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, WHEN FIRST 
PROPOSED OFFICIALLY BY THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE BOARD ON 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

NOV. 19, THIS NOTION FACED STIFF RESISTANCE FROM THE 
LEADERS OF A NUMBER OF THE SMALL PARTIES WHO FEARED 
LOSING THEIR OWN PERSONAL POWER OR INFLUENCE.  KOSTOV 
THUS CAME UNDER SERIOUS THREAT OF LOSING HIS LEADERSHIP 
POST, BUT HIS P0SITI0N WAS B0LSTERED GREATLY BY THE 
SUCCESS 0F THE RECENT ANTI-S0CIALIST PR0TESTS. 
 
11. (C)  N0W WITH A UNIFIED PARTY BEHIND HIM, K0ST0V AND 
0THER UDF LEADERS STILL FACE AN EN0RMOUS CHALLENGE TO 
0RGANIZE AND ADMINISTER PRIMARIES AND SUBSEQUENT 
ELECT0RAL CAMPAIGNS IN LESS THAN TW0 M0NTHS.  A RELATED 
AND EQUALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE WILL BE T0 NEG0TIATE 
C0ALITI0N ARRANGEMENTS WITH THEIR UNITED 0PP0SITI0N

BULGARIANS, SIMILARLY TELLING PARLIAMENT\'S MAY 7 OPENING

ALS0 USHERS IN A NEW ERA 0F AGREEMENT AND COOPERATION

ANN0UNCED THAT F0REIGN P0LICY UNDER HIS G0VERNMENT WILL 
BE FULLY CONS0NANT WITH PRESIDENT STOYAN0V\'S PR0GRAM. 
WE UNDERSTAND FROM VARIOUS S0URCES THAT K0ST0V AND 
ST0YANOV HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT THAT STOYANOV WILL

QUITE EFFECTIVE WITH THE INTELLIGENT, BUT RELATIVELY

11.(C)  ON THE.QUESTION OF STYLE, THERE REMAINS ONE 
CAUTIONARY NOTE, HOWEVER.  TO THOSE WHO KNOW HIM BEST, 
IVAN KOSTOV HAS TENDENCIES TOWARD THE AUTHORITARIAN, THE 
ARR0GANT AND THE UNPREDICTABLE - A STYLE DIFFERENT FR0M 
THE BROAD, T0LERANT APPR0ACH 0F HIS P0PULAR CARETAKER 
PREDECESS0R, STEFAN SOFIYANSKI.  WHILE EARLY INDICATIONS 
ARE ENC0URAGING, KEEPING THESE TENDENCIES REINED IN WILL

AND REF0RMIST MAJORITY AND MANAGING PUBLIC EXPECTATI0NS 
WHILE IMPLEMENTING T0UGH EC0N0MIC REF0RM. 
 
PARLIAMENTARY AGENDA 
-------------------- 
12.(C)  THE UDF HAS ALREADY TAKEN THE PARLIAMENT FIRMLY 
IN HAND, WITH PLANS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER 0F 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES FR0M 21 T0 14, IN M0ST CASES 
MERGING THE LEAST ACTIVE INT0 M0RE IMPORTANT

THAT PARLIAMENT W0ULD PASS THE LAWS NECESSARY F0R THE

1.  PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF BULGARIA\'S JUNE 17 ELECTIONS 
SHOW A COMMANDING LEAD FOR THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT SIMEON 
II, WITH AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT SEEMINGLY 
LIKELY BUT NOT YET ASSURED.  THE UDF OF PM KOSTOV HAS 
SUFFERED A SERIOUS DEFEAT, AND HE IS EXPECTED TO RESIGN 
AS PARTY LEADER SHORTLY.  THE SOCIALISTS AND THE ETHNIC 
TURKISH MRF DID SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN EXPECTED.  A FIFTH 
POLITICAL GROUPING, GERGYOVDEN-VMRO, FELL JUST SHORT OF 
THE NECESSARY FOUR PERCENT OF THE VOTE TO ENTER 
PARLIAMENT, BUT MAY REQUEST A RECOUNT.  FINAL RESULTS 
ARE EXPECTED ON JUNE 20, BUT TALK OF POSSIBLE 
COALITIONS HAS ALREADY BEGUN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------- 
PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
------------------- 
 
2.  WITH OVER 99 PERCENT OF PRECINCTS REPORTING, THE 
NATIONAL MOVEMENT SIMEON II (NMS2), POLITICAL VEHICLE 
OF THE FORMER TSAR, HAS A COMMANDING LEAD IN ELECTIONS 
TO BULGARIA\'S 240-SEAT UNICAMERAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. 
BALLOTS CAST ABROAD HAVE NOT YET BEEN COUNTED AND 
OFFICIAL RESULTS ARE NOT EXPECTED UNTIL WEDNESDAY, JUNE 
20, BUT IF THESE NUMBERS HOLD UP, NMS2 WILL PROBABLY 
HAVE AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY (SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES OF 
BULGARIA\'S 31-DISTRICT PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION 
SYSTEM). 
 
3.  PRELIMINARY RESULTS ANNOUNCED BY THE CENTRAL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        SOFIA  03033  01 OF 03  180953Z 
ELECTION COMMISSION EARLY ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 18 ARE 
AS FOLLOWS (A PARTY OR COALITION MUST RECEIVE 4 PERCENT 
OF THE VOTE NATIONWIDE TO ENTER PARLIAMENT): 
 
PARTY       PCT.     SEATS (ESTIMATED) 
-----      -----     ----- 
NMS2       43.05      121 
UDF        18.24       51 
BSP        17.35       48 
MRF         6.75       20 
GER-VMRO    3.67        0 
 
4.  BASED ON THESE FIGURES, FOUR COALITIONS ARE CERTAIN 
TO ENTER THE NEW PARLIAMENT:  NMS2; THE UNITED 
DEMOCRATIC FORCES (UTDDF) LED BY OUTGOING PM IVAN 
KOSTOV\'S UNION OF DEMOCRATIC FORCES (UDF); THE 
COALITION FOR BULGARIA LED BY THE BULGARIAN SOCIALIST 
PARTY (BSP); AND THE MRF-LIBERAL-EUROROMA COALITION LED 
BY THE PREDOMINANTLY ETHNIC-TURKISH MOVEMENT FOR RIGHTS 
AND FREEDOMS (MRF).  THE FATE OF THE FIFTH COALITION, 
GERGYOVDEN-VMRO, AND WITH IT A POSSIBLE NMS2 OUTRIGHT 
MAJORITY, HANGS IN THE BALANCE. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  THE NMS2 VICTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN 
MORE RESOUNDING WERE IT NOT FOR VOTER CONFUSION.  TWO 
FRINGE COALITIONS UNAFFILIATED WITH THE TSAR ADDED THE 
WORDS \"SIMEON II\" TO THEIR NAMES, AND MANAGED TO GRAB 
MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE VOTE BETWEEN THEM (ONE CAME 
WITHIN HALF A PERCENT OF ENTERING PARLIAMENT!).  IN 
OTHER WORDS, ALMOST 50 PERCENT OF VOTERS TRIED TO CAST 
THEIR BALLOTS FOR SIMEON.  END COMMENT.

6.  THE OSCE ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION WILL HOLD A 
PRESS CONFERENCE LATER TODAY (JUNE 18).  BASED ON MEDIA 
ACCOUNTS AND THE REPORTS OF EMBASSY PERSONNEL WHO 
PARTICIPATED IN THE OBSERVATION EFFORT, THERE WERE NO 
SERIOUS IRREGULARITIES IN BULGARIA ITSELF.  COMPLAINTS 
HAVE BEEN MADE, HOWEVER, ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE 
ELECTION ABROAD.  THESE CONCERN MAINLY A LACK OF 
ORGANIZATION AND INSUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF BALLOT 
PAPERS AT POLLING PLACES IN TURKEY, SPAIN, GERMANY AND 
ELSEWHERE. 
 
--------------------- 
HARD LOSS FOR THE UDF 
--------------------- 
 
7.  THE UDF DID SOMEWHAT WORSE THAN EXPECTED, AND CAME 
PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO FALLING PAST THE BSP INTO THIRD 
PLACE OVERALL.  NMS2 BEAT UDF IN EVERY REGION, 
INCLUDING THE PARTY\'S TRADITIONAL STRONGHOLDS SOFIA AND 
PLOVDIV.  TO MAKE THE PILL EVEN MORE BITTER FOR PM

KOSTOV, UDF TOOK SECOND PLACE IN ONLY 11 OF BULGARIA\'S 
31 ELECTORAL REGIONS, AND WAS BEATEN INTO FOURTH PLACE 
IN THREE OF THEM:  SILISTRA, TARGOVISHTE AND SHUMEN.

125 SEATS IN PARLIAMENT; NOW IT WILL HAVE 51. 
 
8.  KOSTOV CONCEDED DEFEAT AND IS EXPECTED TO TENDER 
HIS RESIGNATION AS PARTY LEADER SHORTLY, ALTHOUGH HE 
MAY WELL STAND FOR THAT POST AGAIN.  IN CONGRATULATING 
SIMEON, KOSTOV SAID HE EXPECTS NMS2 TO CONTINUE TO 
IMPLEMENT NECESSARY BUT PAINFUL REFORMS INITIATED BY 
HIS ADMINISTRATION.  BECAUSE OF THESE REFORMS, KOSTOV 
CONCLUDED, THE UDF LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF VOTERS BUT 
BULGARIA WON THE CONFIDENCE OF THE WORLD:  \"WE BUILT AN 
INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION, AND A GOOD BASIS FOR EUROPEAN 
AND EURO-ATLANTIC INTEGRATION.\"

MRF BOUNCES BACK; GERGYOVDEN-VMRO IN LIMBO 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9.  THE MAINLY ETHNIC TURKISH MRF BOUNCED BACK STRONGLY 
IN THE LATTER STAGES OF THE CAMPAIGN, AND DID BETTER 
THAN MOST POLLSTERS HAD EXPECTED.  IN FACT, THE MRF WAS 
THE ONLY PARTY TO DO BETTER THAN NMS2 IN ANY REGION: 
IT WON A MAJORITY IN KURDZHALI AND A PLURALITY IN 
RAZGRAD, BOTH DISTRICTS WITH LARGE ETHNIC TURKISH 
POPULATIONS AND IN WHICH NMS2 DID NOT CAMPAIGN 
ACTIVELY.  IT APPEARS THERE WAS VERY HEAVY VOTING IN 
TURKEY AS WELL, WITH PEOPLE STANDING IN LINE AS LONG AS 
SIX HOURS AT POLLING STATIONS IN ISTANBUL AND 
ELSEWHERE, ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS.

COALITION OF TWO MILDLY NATIONALIST FORMATIONS -- THE

GERGYOVDEN MOVEMENT AND THE INTERNAL MACEDONIAN 
REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION (VMRO) -- REMAINS IN LIMBO. 
EARLY RETURNS SHOWED THEM ABOVE THE FOUR PERCENT 
THRESHOLD FOR ENTRY TO PARLIAMENT, BUT BY EARLY MONDAY 
MORNING IT APPEARED THEY HAD FALLEN OUT OF CONTENTION. 
GERGYOVDEN LEADER LYUBEN DILOV JR. SUGGESTED HE MIGHT 
DEMAND A HAND RECOUNT.  IF THE RESULTS STAND AND 
GERGYOVDEN-VMRO DOES NOT GET INTO PARLIAMENT, AN 
OUTRIGHT MAJORITY FOR NMS2 APPEARS LIKELY. 
 
11.  COMMENT:  THE MRF, FOR ITS PART, CLAWED ITS WAY 
BACK FROM THE EDGE OF POLITICAL OBLIVION, AND PARTY 
LEADER AHMED DOGAN MUST BE BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF 
AND RELISHING THE PROSPECT OF THUMBING HIS NOSE AT 
KOSTOV FROM A LIKELY POSITION INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT. 
GERGYOVDEN-VMRO, MEANWHILE, IF IT FAILS TO REACH FOUR 
PERCENT, WILL PROBABLY SPLIT INTO ITS CONSTITUENT 
PARTS.  VMRO -- WITH A LONG HISTORY, COHERENT IDEOLOGY 
AND REPRESENTATION ON SEVERAL MUNICIPAL COUNCILS -- 
WILL PROBABLY SOLDIER ON AT THE FRINGES OF POWER. 
GERGYOVDEN -- A MUCH LOOSER FORMATION THAT COUNTED ON 
THE PROTEST VOTE SUBSEQUENTLY VACUUMED UP BY SIMEON -- 
IS MORE LIKELY TO FADE SLOWLY AWAY.  END COMMENT.

WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

12.  UNDER THE BULGARIAN CONSTITUTION, THE NEW 
PARLIAMENT MUST ASSEMBLE WITHIN ONE MONTH.  PRESIDENT 
STOYANOV IS OBLIGED TO OFFER THE NMS2, AS TOP VOTE-

GETTER, THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO FORM A GOVERNMENT. 
SPOKESMEN FOR SIMEON SAY THE TSAR HAS NOT DECIDED 
WHETHER TO SEEK THE POST OF PRIME MINISTER.  THE NMS2 
LEADER IN PLOVDIV AND POSSIBLE FUTURE FINANCE MINISTER 
MILEN VELCHEV SAID NMS2 WILL SEEK A BROAD COALITION 
WITH PARTIES THAT CAN SUPPORT THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS 
OF THE TSAR\'S PROGRAM (REF A), BUT WILL NOT WORK WITH 
\"CORRUPT OR DISCREDITED\" INDIVIDUALS.  HE AND OTHER 
NMS2 REPRESENTATIVES STRESSED THAT THE NEW GOVERNMENT 
WILL PURSUE CONTINUITY IN FOREIGN POLICY, PARTICULARLY 
AS REGARDS MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU AND NATO AND STABILITY 
IN THE BALKANS. 
 
13.  SERIOUS COALITION NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNLIKELY UNTIL 
FINAL ELECTION RESULTS ARE ANNOUNCED, PROBABLY ON JUNE 
20.  IN THE MEANTIME, HOWEVER, FEELERS ARE ALREADY OUT. 
JUST DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, KOSTOV DECLARED THAT HE 
WOULD NOT ACCEPT A COALITION WITH NMS2.  AS THE RESULTS 
CAME IN SUNDAY NIGHT, HOWEVER, OTHER PARTY LEADERS LEFT 
THE DOOR OPEN.  UDF GENERAL SECRETARY EKATERINA 
MIKHAILOVA SAID THE UDF IS WILLING TO TALK ABOUT A 
COALITION WITH THE NMS2 IF THE LATTER INITIATES THE 
DISCUSSION, AND PROVIDED THAT SUCH A COALITION DOES NOT 
INCLUDE THE BSP.  FOR THEIR PARTS, THE LEADERS OF BOTH

14. WITH RESULTS STILL UNOFFICIAL AND A TSARIST 
MAJORITY NOT YET CERTAIN, THE ONLY THING THAT CAN BE 
SAFELY SAID ABOUT THE NEXT BULGARIAN GOVERNMENT IS THAT 
IT WILL BE DOMINATED BY THE NMS2.  REFTELS ADDRESS THE 
STATED PRIORITIES OF THE MOVEMENT (FOREIGN POLICY 
CONTINUITY, ACCELERATED ECONOMIC REFORM AND MORE 
ATTENTION TO SOCIAL NEEDS) AND THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS 
LIKELY TO FACE IN PURSUING THEM.  AS NOTED IN REF B, 
AND REITERATED BY NMS2 REPRESENTATIVES AS THE RESULTS 
CAME IN, THERE ARE NO PLANS TO SEEK A RESTORATION OF 
THE MONARCHY (AT LEAST FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE). 
 
15.  AS FOR THE OTHER PARTIES, THEY MUST LICK THEIR 
WOUNDS AND AWAIT A CALL FROM SIMEON.  THIS WAS A 
HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR THE UDF, AND KOSTOV IS ALL BUT 
CERTAIN TO OFFER HIS RESIGNATION, BUT HIS RETURN TO THE 
HELM OF THE PARTY CANNOT BE RULED OUT.  MUCH MAY DEPEND 
ON HOW MUCH NMS2 WOULD BE PREPARED TO OFFER THE UDF TO 
BRING IT INTO A NEW GOVERNMENT (OR AT LEAST SECURE ITS 
SUPPORT ON KEY ITEMS OF SIMEON\'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA). 
 
16.  THE SOCIALISTS DID SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN EXPECTED, 
WHICH SHOULD BOLSTER THE POSITION OF THEIR REFORMIST 
CHAIRMAN GEORGI PURVANOV.  BUT THEY REMAINED BEHIND THE 
UDF, THE PARTY\'S UNRECONSTRUCTED LEFT IS ALREADY 
CALLING FOR PURVANOV\'S HEAD, AND THE PARTY COULD SPLIT. 
STILL, FEW IN THE BSP EXPECTED TO WIN THE ELECTION, AND 
THEY CAN TAKE SOLACE IN THE FACT THAT SIMEON ACHIEVED 
THEIR MAIN OBJECTIVE FOR THEM:  REMOVING KOSTOV AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

COMPANY FROM POWER.  WHILE AN NMS2-BSP COALITION IS 
UNLIKELY, THE SOCIALISTS MAY STILL FIND COMMON GROUND 
WITH SIMEON ON ISSUES SUCH AS WAGE AND PENSION 
INCREASES, WHILE WORKING TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AS THE 
MOST CREDIBLE OPPOSITION PARTY.  (IN THAT CONNECTION, A 
SECONDARY RESULT OF THESE ELECTIONS IS THAT THE BSP 
FINDS ITSELF, FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST, WITH NO SERIOUS 
COMPETITION ON THE POLITICAL LEFT:  THE BULGARIAN EURO- 
LEFT PARTY, WHICH HAD HOPED TO EMERGE AS A SOCIAL 
DEMOCRATIC ALTERNATIVE TO THE BSP, GOT JUST ONE PERCENT 
AND ITS LEADER, ALEXANDER TOMOV, PROMPTLY RESIGNED).

1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE FOUR MOST PROMINENT MEMBERS OF 
THE SO-CALLED \"LAWYERS CIRCLE,\" WHICH HAS BEEN 
EXTREMELY INFLUENTIAL WITHIN THE RULING NATIONAL 
MOVEMENT SIMEON II (NDSV), HAVE COME UNDER VARYING 
                          SECRET 
 
PAGE 02        SOFIA  00088  01 OF 02  101523Z 
DEGREES OF SUSTAINED CRITICISM IN RECENT WEEKS, MUCH 
OF IT RELATED TO CORRUPTION.  THE PRIME MINISTER HAS 
THUS FAR BEEN AVERSE TO TAKING DECISIVE ACTION IN SUCH 
MATTERS.  HIS REACTION TO THE CONTROVERSIES SWIRLING 
AROUND INTERIOR MINISTER PETKANOV, DEFENSE MINISTER 
SVINAROV, SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT GERDZHIKOV AND NDSV 
FLOOR LEADER PANAYOTOV, WILL SAY MUCH ABOUT HIS 
LEADERSHIP AND MAY ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON 
THE LONGEVITY OF HIS GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) OF THE VARIOUS GROUPS WITHIN THE HETEROGENEOUS 
RULING PARTY, THE MOST INFLUENTIAL HAS BEEN THE SO- 
CALLED \"LAWYERS CIRCLE\" (REF A).  IT IS COMPOSED 
PRIMARILY OF FORMER PROFESSORS FROM THE SOFIA 
UNIVERSITY LAW FACULTY AND THEIR STUDENTS.  THE 
LEADING FIGURES ARE THE FORMER LAW PROFESSORS OGNYAN 
GERDZHIKOV (NOW SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT), PLAMEN 
PANAYOTOV (FLOOR LEADER OF THE NDSV PARLIAMENTARY 
FACTION) AND GEORGI PETKANOV (MINISTER OF INTERIOR). 
ALL ARE REPORTEDLY CLOSE TO THE PM\'S NOTORIOUS FORMER 
CHIEF OF STAFF, STOYAN GANEV.  LAWYER NIKOLAY SVINAROV 
WAS NOT A KEY MEMBER OF THIS GROUP INITIALLY BUT 
REPORTEDLY OWES HIS APPOINTMENT AS DEFENSE MINISTER 
AND NDSV DEPUTY CHAIRMAN TO THEIR INFLUENCE.  (THERE 
HAS ALSO BEEN UNCORROBORATED SPECULATION THAT HIS 
LEGAL SERVICES FOR REPUTED ORGANIZED CRIME FIGURE 
VASIL BOZHKOV, A.K.A. \"THE SKULL,\" WHO WAS ALSO CLOSE 
TO GANEV, PLAYED A ROLE IN HIS SELECTION.) 
 
3. (S) INTERIOR MINISTER PETKANOV HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT 
OF RIGHT-WING SUSPICION SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT, THANKS 
                          SECRET 
 
PAGE 03        SOFIA  00088  01 OF 02  101523Z 
TO HIS REPUTATION AS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST 
NOMENKLATURA AT SOFIA UNIVERSITY.  HIS SUPPORT OF THE 
INEFFECTIVE AND PROBABLY CORRUPT PROSECUTOR GENERAL 
NIKOLA FILCHEV HAS DRAWN CRITICISM FROM WOULD-BE 
REFORMERS.  NOW HE IS ALSO EMBROILED IN THE \"GNOME\" 
WIRETAPPING AFFAIR (REF C).  MOI CHIEF SECRETARY BOYKO 
BORISOV TOLD THE DCM THAT HE HAD ADVISED THE PRIME 
MINISTER ON JANUARY 5 THAT AS A RESULT OF THE \"GNOME\" 
SCANDAL EITHER HE, PETKANOV, OR THE HEAD OF THE 
NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE GEN CHOBANOV WOULD HAVE 
TO GO.  SINCE BORISOV IS WILDLY POPULAR WITH THE 
BULGARIAN PUBLIC (AND, SEEMINGLY, WITH THE PM) AND 
CHOBANOV RECENTLY RECEIVED A VOTE OF \"ABSOLUTE 
CONFIDENCE\" FROM THE PRESIDENT, BORISOV\'S CALL APPEARS 
TO BE A TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT TO OUST HIS LONG-TIME 
NEMESIS PETKANOV. 
 
4. (S) DEFENSE MINISTER SVINAROV HAS COME UNDER FIRE 
RECENTLY FROM AT LEAST TWO DIRECTIONS.  A U.S. TEAM 
INVESTIGATING THE ILLEGAL SALE OF DUAL-USE GOODS TO 
SYRIA BY THE MOD-OWNED FIRM TEREM BRIEFED THE PM IN 
DECEMBER ON ITS CONCLUSIONS THAT SVINAROV WAS AWARE OF 
AT LEAST ONE SHIPMENT AFTER THE FACT, BUT FAILED TO 
TAKE TIMELY ACTION TO STOP A SECOND SHIPMENT OR TO 
INFORM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE 
TRANSGRESSION.  CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF GEN KOLEV 
(STRICTLY PROTECT) HAS ALSO LEVELED CHARGES OF 
CORRUPTION WITHIN THE MOD IN A (THUS FAR) STILL SECRET 
REPORT DELIVERED TO THE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR MOD 
LEADERS.

PAGE 04        SOFIA  00088  01 OF 02  101523Z 
5. (C) NDSV FLOOR LEADER (AND THE PARTY\'S FIRST DEPUTY 
CHAIRMAN) PANAYOTOV HAS BEEN A DIVISIVE FIGURE AMONG 
THE PARTY\'S MPS.  MANY NDSV PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE 
COMPLAINED OF BEING FROZEN OUT OF DECISION-MAKING.  HE 
HAS ALSO BEEN CRITICIZED FOR HIS \"AUTHORITARIAN\" 
MANAGEMENT STYLE AND FOR MAKING PATRONAGE APPOINTMENTS 
WITHOUT CONSULTING OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP.  THE 
PRESS HAS BEEN REPORTING FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS 
THAT CHANGES IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARLIAMENTARY 
GROUP ARE IMMINENT, WITH THE PRIME MINISTER LIKELY TO 
REPLACE PANAYOTOV WITH AN MP MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE 
PARTY\'S REBELLIOUS YOUNG TURKS.  (WE BELIEVE RUMORS OF 
PANAYOTOV\'S IMMINENT DEPARTURE ARE STILL VERY 
SPECULATIVE, HOWEVER.)  RECENTLY PANAYOTOV ALSO MET 
WITH THE \"VUZRAZHDANE\" BUSINESS CLUB, WHICH COUNTS 
AMONG ITS MEMBERS VASIL BOZHKOV AND OTHER SHADY 
\"BUSINESSMEN\" BELIEVED TO BE LINKED TO ORGANIZED CRIME 
GROUPS.  (ONE MP CLOSE TO PANAYOTOV TOLD US HE HAD 
SOUGHT AND RECEIVED THE PM\'S BLESSING FOR THIS 
MEETING.) 
 
6. (C) PARLIAMENT CHAIRMAN (SPEAKER) GERDZHIKOV, WHO 
IS CLOSELY ALLIED WITH MINISTER PETKANOV, HAD MANAGED 
TO STAY ABOVE THE FRAY UNTIL RECENTLY.  HE HAS NOW

MINISTER ANTON STANKOV.  STANKOV\'S REFORM EFFORTS HAVE 
BEEN STYMIED BY AN ENTRENCHED JUDICIAL BUREAUCRACY 
(REF B), AND HE HAS BUTTED HEADS REPEATEDLY WITH 
FILCHEV.  WE HAVE HEARD FROM SEVERAL SOURCES THAT THE 
PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER PETKANOV HAVE NOT 
SUPPORTED STANKOV\'S INITIATIVES TO REFORM THE JUDICIAL 
SYSTEM, ALTHOUGH RECENTLY THE PM DID INDICATE HE WOULD 
SUPPORT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS TO THIS END. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT:  THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT THE 
ATTACKS ON THE \"LAWYERS CIRCLE\" ARE PART OF AN 
ORCHESTRATED SCHEME; A NUMBER OF OTHER PROMINENT 
FIGURES ARE ALSO UNDER POLITICAL AND/OR LEGAL PRESSURE 
AT THIS TIME FOR VARIOUS REASONS (INCLUDING FILCHEV,

ATANAS ATANASOV, FORMER PM IVAN KOSTOV AND SEVERAL 
OFFICIALS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION).  NOR IS IT CLEAR TO 
WHAT EXTENT THE \"LAWYERS CIRCLE\" REMAINS A COHESIVE 
GROUP.  STILL, SUGAREV\'S ATTACK ON GERDZHIKOV APPEARS 
TO COMPLETE THE CHESSBOARD FOR A MAJOR POLITICAL 
SHOWDOWN IN 2003.  IN ITS INITIAL STAGES, AT LEAST, IT 
APPEARS THE GAME WILL PIT THE LAWYERS CIRCLE (ALONG

COMPLICATING THIS SCENARIO IS THE FACT THAT A NUMBER 
OF UDF OFFICIALS REMAIN CLOSE TO FILCHEV, WHO WAS A

9. (C) COMMENT, CONTINUED:  IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL 
WHETHER THE LAWYERS GROUP CAN RETAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF 
THE PM, AND WITH IT CONTROL OF LEADING POSITIONS 
WITHIN THE GOB, AND/OR WHETHER THE BATTLE WILL SPLIT 
THE NDSV AND PERHAPS FORCE EARLY ELECTIONS.  MEANWHILE 
THE OPPOSITION SOCIALIST PARTY (BSP), WHICH HAS A 
COMFORTABLE LEAD IN MOST OPINION POLLS, SEEMS LIKELY 
TO STAY ON THE SIDELINES AND LET THE OTHER PLAYERS 
BATTER EACH OTHER.  END COMMENT.

TAGS: SOCI, PGOV, KIRF, BU 
SUBJECT:  BULGARIAN COURT RULING ENDS MUSLIM LEADERSHIP 
DISPUTE...FOR THE TIME BEING 
 
REF: 03 SOFIA 2303 
 
1.   SUMMARY:  A recent court ruling has resolved -- at 
least for the time being -- the leadership dispute that 
has divided the top echelons of Bulgaria\'s Muslim 
community since December 2003.  A new chief mufti (the 
spiritual head of the denomination) has been appointed; 
however the community\'s new administrative head -- a 
former chief mufti who was originally appointed by the 
former communist regime -- will in effect control all of 
its resources.  The ethnic-Turkish Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (MRF) -- the government\'s junior coalition 
partner -- has denounced the court rulings and refused to 
recognize the authority of the new leadership.  The MRF 
supports a rival faction in the leadership dispute and 
fears that the new leadership will not be sufficiently 
beholden to the party.  END SUMMARY. 
2.   Bulgaria\'s former Muslim leader, Nedim Gendzhev, who 
is best known for his public warnings of a Muslim 
fundamentalist threat in Bulgaria (reftel), has been 
reinstated head of the Supreme Islamic Council, the 
Bulgarian Muslim community\'s administrative ruling body. 
He last held the position from 1995 to 1997.  Originally, 
Gendzhev was appointed Chief Mufti in 1988, a year before 
Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov was toppled from power. 
Despite his earlier support from the Socialists, Gendzhev 
is not known to have any links to them currently, and 
instead seems to operate purely as a free agent. 
3.   The MRF has consistently portrayed itself as the 
defender of the ethnic-Turkish minority and the only 
guarantor of Bulgaria\'s ethnic tolerance.  In addition to 
its political power, the party has exerted its influence 
in most spheres of life affecting its constituency, 
including the leadership of the Muslim denomination.  The 
MRF has voiced its extreme displeasure with the current 
state of affairs, refusing to recognize Gendzhev, his 
Supreme Islamic Councilor the new Chief Mufti.  The party 
has long supported Fikri Sali and his followers while 
painting Gendzhev and his faction as the real danger to 
ethnic and religious peace in Bulgaria.  The MRF is 
likely to use every possible means to keep Gendzhev from 
once again taking control of the Muslim community 
leadership, which it views as its own domain. 
4.   The most recent leadership dispute was triggered in 
December 2003 after two rival Muslim conferences -- one 
organized by the MRF-supported Muslim leadership and the 
other by Gendzhev -- convened and elected separate chief 
muftis -- Fikri Sali and Ali Hadjuk, respectively.  The 
2002 Confessions Act\'s lack of specific provisions 
regulating the change in leadership of registered 
denominations meant the only option for resolving the 
dispute was for the two parties to file civil cases in 
court. 
5.   On 19 July, the Sofia City Court appointed an 
interim triumvirate of Fikri Sali, Ridvan Kadiov and 
Osman Osmailov (all closely linked to the MRF) to 
represent the Muslim community and prevent misuse of the 
denomination\'s resources pending the outcome of the civil 
suits.  On 5 November, the Sofia Appellate Court over- 
ruled the appointment of the triumvirate, stating that 
the denomination\'s leadership could only be appointed on 
its own initiative and not ex officio by the Sofia City 
Court.  Fikri Sali has appealed the decision to the 
Supreme Court of Cassation. 
6.   COMMENT:  Most legal observers believe the Supreme 
Court will uphold the decision to re-install Gendzhev, 
but Fikri Sali and his supporters are unlikely to give 
up.  There are other administrative and judicial 
decisions in the history of this convoluted legal battle 
that could -- and probably will -- be challenged in 
court.  This is a battle over property and other 
resources controlled by the Supreme Islamic Council and 
political influence within the Muslim community.  It has 
very little to do with spiritual matters or religious 
freedom.  END COMMENT.

testing.  Commercialization and trade (both imports and 
exports) were not subject to this decree.  Therefore, the 
legislation was de facto silent on the trade implementing 
regulations of the Cartagena Protocol. 
 
2.  Bulgaria started transposing the EU biotech legislation 
in 2003/2004, due to its impending EU accession in 2007.  A 
Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) Law was drafted and 
submitted to the Parliament in March 2004.  Due to its 
political sensitivity, this law is still in the Parliament. 
Unofficially, the Committees on Agriculture, Environment and 
Health, which have responsibility for this law, claim that 
nearly two-thirds of the legislation has already been 
approved.  Final approval of the whole package is expected 
in early 2005. 
 
3.  Under the current draft, the new GMO Law will cancel any 
preceding regulations, such as the Biosafety Decree of 1996. 
The proposed legislation is based on the EU regulations, but 
in many areas is much more restrictive than the EU biotech 
legislation.  For example, the current draft would create a 
list of specific products (tobacco, roses, etc.) that are 
banned from commercialization as GM crops.  Also, it calls 
for certain geographic areas beyond the normal buffer zones 
(national parks, national reserves, expanded buffer zones) 
to remain GMO-free. 
 
4.  According to most researchers, experts, and politicians, 
the law will not be enforceable.  Furthermore, the law, if 
approved by March 2005 as currently planned, will need 
further modifications in order to reflect recent changes in 
the EU legislation. 
 
5.  We have met with members of the relevant committees to 
discuss the law and will continue to work with them to make 
it more acceptable.  Post looks forward to a potential 
January visit of State Dept\'s Senior Advisor for 
Agricultural Biotechnology, Madelyn Spirnak, to reinforce 
our message.

SUBJECT: BULGARIA PUSHES FOR MILITARY SALES TO IRAQ

(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JAMES PARDEW, FOR REASONS 
1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: In another sign that Bulgarian political 
leaders are agressively looking for concrete benefits from 
their military participation in Iraq, Deputy Prime Minister 
and Minister of Economy Lydia Shuleva met with Ambassador 
and the Iraqi Ambassador to Bulgaria, Hayder Al Barrack, on 
January 4.  Shuleva requested the meeting amid signs of 
increasing Bulgarian frustration over their inability to 
win any substantial contracts for Iraq and the recent Iraqi 
award of a 236 million USD military contract to a Polish 
defense contractor (ref E).  Both Ambassadors presented 
specific recommendations on methods to improve Bulgaria\'s 
contract chances and encouraged the Bulgarians to be more 
aggressive in Washington and Baghdad in their search for 
contracts. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikolay 
Milkov and Petur Karaangelov, Director of the state-owned 
arms trading firm, Kintex, also attended the meeting.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador expressed gratitude to Shuleva for 
Bulgaria\'s help in Iraq and pledged to continue to work 
with the GOB to assist it in its attempts to land contracts 
for Bulgarian defense firms.  Ambassador suggested that the 
GOB military attachQ in Washington should take a more 
forward-leaning stance in helping Bulgarian companies find 
appropriate contracts, and that the GOB should use its 
commercial advocates in Washington, Patton Boggs, to 
assist.  He also suggested that the GOB form a consortium 
of interested Bulgarian defense companies to bid more 
effectively on coming contracts and subcontracts. 
Concerning the Polish deal, Ambassador clarified that this 
was a contract between the GOP and IIG and not a direct 
U.S. contract.  He emphasized the importance of restoring 
Bulgarian non-military representation in Baghdad as a means 
to further its interests there, since presently the GOB has 
no diplomatic representation in Baghdad. Ambassador said 
contracts are competitive and Bulgaria must be competitive 
to win them. 
 
3. (C)  Iraqi Ambassador to Bulgaria Hayder Al Barrack said 
that Polish diplomats in Baghdad had helped win the large 
contract.  Al Barrack added that the GOB must have \"direct 
contact\" with Iraqi officials in Baghdad if they want to 
get their foot in the door.  He encouraged the Bulgarians 
to restore their non-military presence in Baghdad as soon 
as possible.  He told Shuleva that after the January 
elections the GOB should invite high-level Iraqi officials 
and ministers to Sofia in order to establish contact with 
their Iraqi government counterparts. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: This meeting was one more example of 
Bulgarian eagerness to land serious contracts for Iraqi, 
which several high-level Bulgarian officials have expressed 
to us in recent months.  We have encouraged the Bulgarians 
to take advantage of their commercial competitiveness, 
especially in the defense sector, while simultaneously 
cautioning them that Bulgarian firms cannot expect to be 
handed contracts on a platter.

NSC FOR D.WILSON 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL: (##) 
TAGS: PGOV, BU 
SUBJECT: BULGARIAN PRESIDENT PURVANOV REQUESTS MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT BUSH IN FIRST HALF OF 2005 
 
 
Classified by Amb. Pardew for reasons 1.4 B & D 
 
1. (SBU) The Chief of Staff to President Purvanov, Andrei 
Karaslavov, called on the Ambassador to request a meeting between 
the two presidents.  Purvanov prefers the first half of this year. 
 
2. (SBU) Karaslavov noted that Bulgaria has been the most stalwart 
coalition ally in Iraq, but is the only coalition partner whose 
head of state has not had a formal meeting with President Bush. 
(Purvanov has had two photo-op/pull-asides with President Bush on 
the margins of international meetings.)  Purvanov would prefer an 
official visit to Washington, but, informally, Karaslavov 
suggested another format would work.  Karaslavov suggested several 
possible dates: March 14-16, late March/early April and June. 
 
3. (SBU) The Bulgarian Ambassador in Washington, Elena 
Poptodorova, has previously raised with the NSC the possibility of 
a meeting, and we expect that she will do so again upon her return 
to Washington later this week. 
 
4. (SBU) Purvanov has been important in staying the course on 
Iraq.  He is a very popular, non-controversial political figure in 
Bulgaria.  It is, however, important to note that during this 
election year, the leader of his party (Bulgarian Socialist Party 
Q BSP) has been slowly, but steadily turning up the rhetoric on 
withdrawing Bulgarian troops from Iraq. 
 
5. (SBU) More important than election year posturing, however, is 
the fact that Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg (National Movement 
of Simeon II Q NDSS), who is gaining ground in his re-election 
campaign, has also asked for a meeting with President Bush before 
the June 26 elections. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT: Post supports a Bush-Purvanov meeting for the 
reasons outlined, but finds the timing of the request problematic. 
Unless the White House can accommodate meetings with both Purvanov 
and Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg, post believes scheduling a Bush- 
Saxe-Coburg meeting should take precedence.  The Ambassador would 
like to discuss both during Washington consulatations scheduled 
next week. END COMMENT
