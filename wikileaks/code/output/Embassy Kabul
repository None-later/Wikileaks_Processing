E.O. 11652: GDS 
TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINT, AF, US 
SUBJECT: FIRST CONVERSATION WITH NEW AFGHAN PRESIDENT 
 
1. MUR MOHAMHAD TARAKI, THE PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN\'S NEW 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND HE LIKES TO BE CALLED \"MR. PRESIDENT,\" 
RECEIVED ME ALONE IN HIS OFFICE AT THE OLD PRIME MINISTRY BUILDING 
AT 5 P.M. ON MAY 6, I WAS RECEIVED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING 
BY THE SAME CHIEF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF PROTOCOL WHO HAD SERVED THE 
PREVIOUS REGIME. AS AN INDICATION OF THE TIMES, THE DEPUTY CHIEF, 
WHO IS A MOHAMMADZAI, STARTED WEEPING WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS 
FAMILY. IT WAS IN THIS MOOD THAT HE USHERED ME INTO HIS NEW CHIEF\'S 
OFFICE. SECURITY PRECAUTIONS SEEMED TO BE MINIMAL, WITH ONLY ONE 
ARMORED VEHICLE VISIBLE IN THE COMPOUND OF THE PRIME MINISTRY. 
 
2. TABAKI GREETED ME WITH A WARM HANDSHAKE AND A FRIENDLY SMILE, 
DULY RECORDED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS. WE THEN SAT DOWN IN THE CORNER OF 
HIS OFFICE AND EXCHANGED A FEW PLEASANTRIES WHILE OUR PICTURES 
CONTINUED TO BE SNAPPED. I GOT A GOOD LAUGH FROM HIM WHEN I SAID I 
WAS SORRY I HAD NOT MET HIM DURING MY FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS IN 
AFGHANISTAN -- AND EVEN SORRIER DURING THE PAST NINE DAYS. TARAKI 
SPOKE EXCELLENT, IF SOMEWHAT RUSTY, ENGLISH. 
 
3. TARAKI BEGAN HIS CONVERSATION BY RECOUNTING WITH OBVIOUS PRIDE 
AND RELISH THE SUCCESS OF HIS REVOLUTION, STRESSING THAT IT IS A 
REVOLUTION AND NOT A COUP. HE SAID ON THURSDAY, APRIL 27, THE TANKS 
FIRST MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF KABUL ABOUT 9 A.M., BUT TOOK MORE 
THAN TWO HOURS TO REACH THE CENTER OF THE CITY. BY EVENING, THE 
DAOUD REGIME HAD LOST THE BATTLE, ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED IN VAIN 
DURING THE NIGHT TO SEND REINFORCEMENTS FROM CENTRAL CORPS 
HEADQUARTERS AND FROM KARGHA. WITH THE COMING OF DAYLIGHT, HE SAID, 
THE AIR FORCE WAS ABLE TO FINISH THE JOB. MEANWHILE, WITHIN THE 
PALACE DAOUD HAD BEEN ASKED TO SURRENDER, BUT REFUSED, SHOT AT HIS 
ATTACKERS, AS DID HIS WIFE AND FAMILY, AND WAS THEREFORE KILLED. 
THE INTENTION, SAID TARAKI, HAD BEEN TO TAKE HIM AS A CAPTIVE. 
TARAKI ADDED THAT DAOUD PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN COURT-MARTIALED 
AND POSSIBLY SHOT. TARAKI HAD YESTERDAY  
THE SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN SHOT BY DAOUD\'S \"WHITE PISTOL\". 
 
4. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WAS SURPRISED THAT I HAD NOT BEEN THE FIRST 
AMBASSADOR TO CALL ON HIM, BECAUSE WHAT HE IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH 
IN AFGHANISTAN IS A \"GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR 
THE PEOPLE.\" CORRECTING HIMSELF A BIT, HE SAID HE HAD ASKED THE SAME 
QUESTION OF THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR BECAUSE PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN 
HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON, CULTURALLY AND ETHNICALLY. 
 
5. I THEN EXPLAINED THAT IN CASES LIKE THIS, WE DO NOT EXTEND FORMAL 
RECOGNITION BUT INDICATE, AS WE HAVE DONE, THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE 
NORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. I SAID, IN FACT, WE HOPE TO HAVE CLOSE 
WORKING RELATIONS WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT. I ADDED, AS OUR NOTE 
STATED, THAT I HOPE HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE SOON TO 
AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF EXISTING TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS. HE MAD NO 
COMMENT ON THAT SUGGESTION. 
 
6. AT SEVERAL POINTS DURING THESE PRELIMINARY EXCHANGES, TARAKI 
REFERRED TO THE TIME HE HAD SPENT IN THE UNITED STATES, HIS 
FRIENDSHIP FOR AMERICANS, AND HIS LIKING FOR THE AMERICAN QUALITY OF 
FRANKNESS. WE AGREED THAT AFGHANS AND AMERICANS HAVE LOTS IN COMMON 
IN THIS REGARD. 
 
7. I THEN STATED I WANTED TO BE FRANK WITH HIM. I SAID THAT, AS HE 
KNEW, THE UNITED STATES HAD NEVER SOUGHT ANY STRATEGIC OR POLITICAL 
ADVANTAGE FROM AFGHANISTAN. HE AGREED. I SAID THAT ONE OF THE CARDINAL 
POINTS OF OUR POLICY IS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE, 
ITS INTEGRITY, AND ITS NATIONAL IDENTITY. HE NODDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. 
I SAID THAT SINCE THE BRITISH LEFT INDIA, IT WAS OUR VIEW THAT THE 
ONLY COUNTRY THAT COULD POSSIBLY THREATEN AFGHANISTAN\'S INDEPENDENCE 
IS THE SOVIET UNION. IN PAST TIMES, I NOTED, OUR POLICY HAD BEEN TO 
TRY TO CONSTRUCT BLOCS AGAINST SOVIET EXPANSIONISM, BUT THAT OUR 
APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM HAD, IN THE COURSE OF TIME BECOME MORE 
SOPHISTICATED. 
 
I STATED WE COULD READILY UNDERSTAND -- GIVEN AFGHANISTAN\'S 
GEOGRAPHIC POSITION AND ECONOMIC NEEDS -- WHY IT WOULD WANT A CLOSE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION. BUT, I SAID, WE WOULD BE DISTURBED 
IF AFGHANISTAN\'S FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICIES WERE TO BECOME 
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THOSE OF THE SOVIET UNION BECAUSE THAT WOULD 
OBLITERATE AFGHANISTAN\'S NATIONAL IDENTITY AND WOULD GIVE RISE TO 
TENSIONS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WHICH COULD THREATEN PEACE. I SAID 
THAT IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE APPRECIATE AFGHANISTAN\'S NONALIGNED 
POLICY. 
 
8. IN RESPONSE, TARAKI AFFIRMED THAT AFGHANISTAN IS AND DESIRES TO 
REMAIN AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY AND MASTER OF ITS OWN DESTINY. HE SAID HE 
WAS PLEASED THAT THE UNITED STATES TAKES A MORE FLEXIBLE VIEW OF THE 
WORLD AND ADMITS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IT MADE A MISTAKE IN VIETNAM. HE 
REFERRED TO HIS BEING IN WASHINGTON DURING THE DAYS OF SENATOR MCCARTHY, 
AND NOTED THAT THE THEN VICE PRESIDENT NIXON HAD REFUSED ONCE TO COME 
TO AN AFGHAN EMBASSY RECEPTION BECAUSE AFGHANISTAN WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE 
SOVIET UNION. HE WAS PLEASED THAT THAT IS NO LONGER THE APPROACH THE 
UNITED STATES TAKES TOWARD HIS COUNTRY. 
 
9. I THEN SAID THAT IN EVALUATING THE POLICIES OF A GOVERNMENT IN A 
DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE AFGHANISTAN, THE UNITED STATES WOULD LOOK FIRST 
AND FOREMOST AT WHAT THAT GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF 
LIVING OF ITS PEOPLE AND TO ASSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS -- 
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND LEGAL. AT THIS POINT, TARAKI BECAME 
MUCH MORE ANIMATED AND HELD FORTH AT SOME LENGTH ON THE SUBJECT OF HOW 
HIS GOVERNMENT WANTS TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HE 
AND HIS COLLEAGUES -- UNLIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, REALLY CARE ABOUT THE 
POOR PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN PUTTING MONEY IN 
SWISS BANKS. HE SAID THAT IN JUDGING HIS GOVERNMENT\'S POLICIES, WE 
SHOULD ASK THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN WHETHER THEY THINK THEY ARE 
SUCCESSFUL. IN THE PAST, HE BELIEVED FOREIGNERS TENDED TO ASK THE 
ARISTOCRATS WHO, OF COURSE, WERE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE POOR 
BECAUSE SUCH A POLICY WOULD THREATEN THEIR OWN PROSPERITY. REGARDING 
HUMAN RIGHTS, TARAKI SAID THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM AND THAT 
EACH NATION MUST JUDGE FOR ITSELF THE KIND OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE MOST 
SUITED TO ITS OWN SITUATION AND CULTURE. HE MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT 
HE WOULD NOT WANT US TO MAKE VALUE JUDGEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT 
TO INTERFERENCE IN AFGHANISTAN\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. I ASSURED HIM THAT 
THE UNITED STATES HAD NO DESIRE TO TRY TO TRANSPLANT ITS GOVERNMENTAL 
SYSTEM ELSEWHERE, BUT THAT WE, NEVERTHELESS, CARE DEEPLY ABOUT HUMAN 
RIGHTS. 
 
10. TARAKI THEN SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD JUDGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS BY 
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT\'S 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMULATED, BUT THAT HE 
WOULD BE ASKING US FOR ASSISTANCE AS, INDEED, HE WOULD BE ASKING THE 
SOVIET UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES. HE SAID THAT THE PRINCIPAL SLOGAN, 
ADDING THAT HE REALLY MEANT POLICY AND NOT SLOGAN, OF HIS GOVERNMENT IS 
TO PROVIDE BREAD, CLOTHING, AND SHELTER FOR THE MASSES. I DESCRIBED OUR 
AID PROGRAM OF RECENT YEARS AND ITS EMPHASIS ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND 
AGRICULTURE FOR THE RURAL POOR. HE SAID HE WOULD TELL ME, AS HE HAD 
TOLD THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR, THAT OUR RESPECTIVE AID PFORAMS HAD FAILED, 
AND THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMITMENT OF THE PREVIOUS 
REGIME. I SAID I AGREED WITH HIM THAT OUR AID PROGRAM HAD NOT ACHIEVED 
ITS GOALS. HE ASKED ME WHY. I REPLIED THAT HE KNEW HIS OWN COUNTRY 
BETTER THAN I, AND THAT I WOULD MERELY SAY THAT THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT 
WAS NOT CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT WE WISHED TO 
SEE IMPLEMENTED. HE OBVIOUSLY TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN MY SAYING THIS. 
 
11. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE 
MEANT BY \"BREAD\". HE SAID HE WANTS TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF 
AFGHANS WHO HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY TO WORK IN IGNOMINY ABROAD. THIS WILL 
MEAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF INDUSTRY AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND HE HOPED WE 
WOULD HELP WITH THAT. I TOLD HIM THAT ONCE THE APPROPRIATE MINISTERS IN 
HIS GOVERNMENT WERE PREPARED TO DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS WITH US, MY AID 
MISSION DIRECTOR AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO SO. 
 
12. I THEN SAID THAT ONE OTHER MATTER OF IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED 
STATES IS THE STABILITY OF THIS REGION IN THE WORLD. I SAID WE HAVE BEEN 
DELIGHTED AT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN 
DEVELOPING REGIONAL COOPERATION. TARAKI SAID THAT THAT WAS, OF COURSE, 
A MATTER THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD BE STUDYING. HE ALSO SAID THAT WHEN 
ONE TALKS OF REGIONAL COOPERATION, THAT MEANS NOT ONLY COOPERATION WITH 
INDIA, PAKISTAN, AND IRAN -- BUT ALSO WITH THE SOVIET UNION. 
 
13. THE CONVERSATION ENDED WITH PLEASANTRIES AS IT HAD BEGUN. HE SAID 
THAT HE HOPED THE SOVIET UNION WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE BUILT MORE 
MOSQUES. BY THE SAME TOKEN, HE HOPED WE WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE, 
HIMSELF, DID NOT GO TO A MOSQUE. HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT EVERYTHING 
HE HAD TOLD ME HE HAD ALSO TOLD THE SOVIET UNION. 
 
14. COMMENT:  TARAKI IS A SLIM, WHITE-HAIRED, PROFESSIONAL MAN WHO LOOKS 
SOMEWHAT OLDER THAN 61. HE HAS THE CHAN AND EMPATHY THAT ONE LEARNS TO 
ASSOCIATE WITH AFGHANS. HE IS ALSO CLEARLY HARDHEADED AND EXHILARATED BY 
HIS SUCCESS. WHEN HE IS PARTICULARLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A POINT HE IS 
MAKING, HIS EYES ASSUME A FIERCE, INTENSITY. OUR CONVERSATION WAS 
EXTREMELY CORDIAL AND WAS ALSO, I THINK, A REAL DIALOGUE.

TAGS: ECON, ETRD, AF, EIAD, ETIO 
SUBJECT: MINISTER ANNOUNCES AFGHAN GSP DESIGNATION AT 1/16 
PRESS CONFERENCE 
 
1. (U) On January 16, Minister of Commerce Seyed Mustafa 
Kazimi convened a press conference to announce the 
designation of Afghanistan as a U.S. GSP beneficiary country. 
 Roughly twenty mostly Afghan print media, VOA and six-eight 
other radio outlets and four TV outlets were present.  USAID 
Director Craig Buck, representing the Ambassador, and 
Econ/Commercial Officer attended for the Embassy. 
 
2. (U) Kazimi highlighted the progress made during the past 
year by Afghanistan in its efforts to resume economic 
relations with its neighbors and the world.  In addition to 
GSP and the Fall 2002 EU &All but Arms8 trade agreement, 
Kazimi noted recent regional trade initiatives as well 
(discussed septel).  Kazimi noted that these efforts were 
directed towards transforming Afghanistan from a primarily 
consumer nation into a more self-reliant trading nation. 
 
3. (U) Kazimi explained that twenty-three years of crisis had 
undermined the foundations of trade and investment, resulting 
in a deterioration in both industrial base and the quality of 
Afghan goods.  This deterioration had rendered Afghan goods 
uncompetitive in global markets and led to the eventual loss 
of overseas markets.  Further, this crisis and the resulting 
instability led to imposition of trade sanctions on 
Afghanistan by many countries.  Kazemi outlined the Afghan 
plan to surmount these obstacles.  First, to improve 
relations with other countries leading to lifting of trade 
sanctions.  Second, to improve trade links with other 
countries to nurture economic growth and resume access to 
outside markets.  Third, to attract good investment to both 
create export-oriented jobs and help improve the quality and 
competitiveness of Afghan goods. 
 
4. (U) Kazimi noted that meetings with Commerce Secretary 
Evans and other Washington officials, and close work with the 
U.S. Embassy over the past five months, had led to the White 
House,s announcement on January 10 of Afghanistan,s 
designation as a GSP beneficiary country.  Kazimi said that 
this was an important event for Afghanistan,s plans for 
economic growth, and would mean up to 5,700 articles could be 
exported to the U.S. duty-free.  Kazimi concluded by thanking 
President Bush, the Secretary of Commerce and other U.S. 
agencies that had supported this step, the Ambassador and the 
Economic/Commercial office of the U.S. Embassy. 
 
5. (U) The media questions following Kazimi,s comments were 
incisive and well-informed, reflecting a notable maturation 
in the quality of the Afghan and regional economic/ financial 
media.  Questions focused upon Afghanistan,s export 
potential, lingering security concerns for investors, customs 
policy, GSP within the context of overall U.S. policy towards 
Afghanistan, and the impact of GSP on regional and other 
Afghan-origin trade flows.  Kazimi responded with optimism 
about Afghanistan,s potential to attract investment and 
build upon its existing export base, reform internal customs 
rules and trade relations with neighbors, and improve export 
market access and investment flows.

1.  (C) In a chance meeting with the Ambassador and Security 
Coordinator MG Karl Eikenberry at the presidential palace on 
February 4, a clearly pleased Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani 
noted that Japan had come through with pledged funding the 
day before.  As a result, Afghanistan was no longer in 
arrears to the IFIs.  Canada was following through with 
pledged funding as well, said Ghani, who asked the Ambassador 
to pass his thanks on to Under Secretary Larson and Treasury 
Under Secretary John Taylor for their efforts on this issue. 
 
2.  (C) Ghani said the defense budget would require intensive 
work in the coming days.  He had made some progress with the 
Defense Ministry on projected army size, and planned to 
impose a sliding scale on the defense budget, with 
progressively smaller amounts budgeted for salaries each year 
until attrition reduced the total army size to a target 
level.  Besides dealing with the defense budget, reducing the 
total number of government ministries also was an imperative, 
Ghani said. 
 
3.  (C) Noting another step forward, Ghani said the Finance 
Ministry had received 2 million USD in customs revenues from 
Herat province.  This is in addition to 2 million USD Herat 
gave the center last fall.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S APRIL 6 MEETING WITH FRENCH AMBASSADOR 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Ambassador held a wide-ranging discussion 
with French Ambassador, Jean Pierre Guinhut, on April 6.  The 
Ambassadors reviewed Afghan security conditions in the 
aftermath of Iraqi Freedom, lingering obstacles to economic 
growth, and progress on the drafting of the Afghan 
Constitution, and other matters.  Highlights included a 
shared view that security conditions in Afghanistan had not 
deteriorated markedly since the war in Iraq began, the French 
Ambassador,s plea that an American economic advisor be added 
to Karzai,s retinue, and the sharing of preliminary news on 
the religious aspects of the new Constitution.  End summary. 
 
=============================== 
Isolated High-Profile Incidents 
But Overall Security Stable 
=============================== 
 
2. (C) Ambassador Guinhut had just returned from visits to 
Jalalabad, ) for the inauguration of the Human Rights 
Commission Office, and Kandahar, to visit with his NGOs.  He 
traveled with the head of the Human Rights Commission, Dr. 
Sima Samar, as part of an effort to increase his/France,s 
&international presence.8  Ambassador asked if Guinhut had 
heard of the recent murder of Karzai associate, Haji Gilani, 
on April 5.  Guinhut responded that the killing appeared to 
result from a family quarrel rather than any general security 
breakdown, to which Ambassador concurred. 
 
3. (C) International assistance agency and NGO workers were 
still alarmed at the recent killing of ICRC employee, Ricardo 
Munguia, on March 27.  Ambassador cautioned that UN SRSG 
Brahimi called the ICRC killing a &qualitative change8 from 
earlier violence, and that a few more such attacks and all 
the NGOs would quit Afghanistan.  Guinhut noted that French 
NGO workers in most of Afghanistan were &not feeling 
threatened but remain cautious8.  Meanwhile, Kandahar-based 
NGOs were &very fearful8 and added that southern areas were 
very unstable. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador noted that security forces based in 
Kandahar were weak and inactive, adding that President Karzai 
had told him that hostile forces could overrun Kandahar &in 
a day8 if U.S. forces depart.  Guinhut was surprised that 
Karzai would put things so starkly, but added that the Swiss 
Ambassador had told him that Pakistan-based extremists were 
openly infiltrating Afghanistan from Quetta, where the GOP 
did not even bother to cover up these operations.  Ambassador 
added that when the Dutch Ambassador told the Kandahar Police 
Chief about this infiltration, the Chief agreed to follow up 
) if only he could be provided names and addresses of the 
suspects. 
5. (C) Despite these incidents and trends, both agreed that 
general security conditions had not eroded in any systematic 
way after the start of U.S. operations in Iraq.   Guinhut 
summed up his view as &it is as bad as usual in the South 
and not much worse elsewhere8.  The Ambassador noted one 
area of continued concern, though, was Ismail Khan,s renewed 
call for Islamic Jihad against foreigners and the recent 
beating and expulsion of an Afghan Radio Liberty stringer ) 
whom Ismail Khan termed &a spy for the infidels8 - for 
reporting human rights violations in Herat.  Dostum, 
meanwhile, was dabbling in a &federalist8 plan for 
Afghanistan, said Guinhut.  Nonetheless, he pledged his 
strong support to the central government during a recent 
meeting with Guinhut in Mazar.  Ambassador replied that 
federalism was neither a popular nor a feasible option for 
the country. 
 
============================ 
Progress on Constitutional 
Commission, Carcassone Visit 
============================ 
 
6. (C) Ambassador turned the discussion to progress on the 
Constitutional Commission,s work.  Guinhut noted that French 
constitutional scholar, Guy Carcassone, was arriving on April 
7 for a two-week stay to advise the Commission and meet with 
interested parties.  Guinhut noted that Carcassone has 
written 25 Constitutions to date, and that his assistance 
could greatly advance the effort.  Ambassador noted that he 
would like to see Carcassone, and later added that since SE 
Khalilzad would be arriving shortly perhaps a larger meeting 
would be appropriate. 
 
7. (C) Guinhut shared with Ambassador information he 
qualified as rumor ) as VP Shahrani, the head of the 
Constitutional Commission had not actually disclosed such 
information yet ) that the new Constitution would call for 
an elected President, a Prime Minister selected from the 
parliament, and two legislative chambers, and that the King 
was not mentioned.  Ambassador added that he had heard that 
Islam would be designated the state religion, but without a 
sect being specified.  He and others he had spoken to wonder 
why Islam needed to be mentioned at all.  Guinhut replied 
that the 1964 Constitution had struck a balance between Islam 
and the Monarchy to avoid too much power devolving to either. 
 French jurist Carcassone reportedly favored a constitutional 
monarchy, Guinhut said, but Karzai reportedly opposed this 
idea and wants a more modern model.  Furthermore, Ambassador 
added, former king Zahir Shah did not want to be king and 
knew no one in his family was qualified to do so. 
 
8. (C) Comment: Ambassador met with Carcassone April 8 at a 
lunch for the EU Ambassador hosted by the French Ambassador. 
Carcassone confirmed his view that the King should serve as 
constitutional monarch and said the Afghans were pushing for 
a Prime Minister.  Ambassador said both were bad ideas and 
Afghanistan needed a strong President given all the vectors 
of power.  Carcassone said the U.S. system worked only 
because of compromises and a prime ministerial system would 
be better for Afghanistan.  Ambassador demurred, saying it 
would only lead to endless crises of power.  End Comment. 
 
============================== 
Guinhut Pleads for Appointment 
of American Economic Advisor 
============================== 
 
9. (C) The conversation turned to Karzai,s commitment to 
making needed Cabinet changes to the large and unwieldy 
government.  Guinhut saw the lack of a Minister of Economy as 
a problem.  Ghani was trying to do the job, and was the best 
possible Finance Minister, but he was &no economist8. 
Guinhut recommended that the USG appoint a qualified economic 
advisor to Karzai, at least until the Presidential election. 
This advisor could lay out stages and options for economic 
growth and should carry sufficient credentials to resist 
interference from Ghani.  Guinhut expressed his strong 
preference for an American advisor (he had already tried 
unsuccessfully to recruit a French advisor) rather than an 
Afghan or Afghan expatriate. 
 
10. (C) Guinhut then commenced a now familiar litany 
regarding the negative attributes of Ghani,s effective 
control of Afghan economic policy.  Guinhut said that Ghani 
and others &gave the impression they were economic liberals, 
but they are not.8  Guinhut offered the investment law as 
illustration of his point, saying it was &made for traders, 
not for investors8 due to its investment-limiting tax 
provisions.  Guinhut disagreed with Ghani,s purported view 
that economic renewal could come through trade.  The economy 
must create jobs, and money is needed from the budget to 
facilitate job creation.  Ambassador said that the TISA was 
not there yet, and was actually driving away investors with 
some of its policies.  Guinhut agreed, noting that taxes on 
investment were &a complete mistake8.  Guinhut also 
expressed surprise that Afghanistan had still not appointed 
an Ambassador to the UAE, which Guinhut regarded as a 
potentially huge investor in Afghan reconstruction.  The 
Ambassador doubted that Afghan Cabinet officials knew what to 
do to spur the economic growth Guinhut described, but Afghans 
may also chafe at a foreign advisor having such extensive 
control over the Afghan economy.  Guinhut feels that without 
such radical intervention, the whole Afghan reconstruction 
program will fail completely and &we8 (major donors) will 
&lose all our money.8 
 
11. (C) Comment: The French Ambassador,s points on economic 
matters closely track Embassy reporting of the past few 
months.  Afghanistan needs someone: first, to generate ideas 
for economic growth; second, to promote international 
investment; third, to coordinate funding to finance projects; 
fourth, to carry through on projects begun; and fifth, to 
tenaciously finalize projects by removing stubborn obstacles. 
 It may be difficult to find any one individual who can do 
all five things.  Ghani is excellent at the first, results 
have been mixed but improving with the third, and he has 
largely failed with the second and latter two items. 
Guinhut,s provocative points corroborate opinions expressed 
through much of the Cabinet and virtually all of the business 
community.  While his view may exaggerate the gravity of the 
situation, it is possible that the right advisor, who could 
bring rapid and visible results, would boost Karzai,s and 
TISA legitimacy enough to dispel concerns about foreign 
influence.  End Comment.

1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Captain Daoud, an Afghan-American investor interested 
in establishing a private airline in Afghanistan, met with 
Ambassador on April 8.  Daoud is seeking OPIC support for the 
establishment of Oxus Air, a private airline serving the U.S. 
and Europe from Afghanistan with a projected fleet of 12 
Boeing aircraft.  A projected second phase of operations 
would include domestic Afghan operations.  Daoud told the 
Ambassador that the Deputy Minister of Civil Aviation, Raz 
Mohammad Alami, told him earlier in the week that he was 
required to own his entire fleet outright to secure an Afghan 
airline operation license. 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador was surprised to learn of this 
restraint on competition, and asked if other airlines 
operating in Afghanistan were subject to this provision. 
Daoud answered that traditionally such decisions ) whether 
to purchase or lease an aircraft fleet or a combination of 
both - were individual business decisions made by the airline 
operator.  Daoud told Ambassador that he had scheduled a 
round of meetings, beginning with VP Amin Arsala on April 9. 
He noted that Civil Aviation, and Alami in particular, had 
had his application since August 2002.  During the interim, 
Alami had asked him to save Ariana rather than competing with 
it and driving it out of existence.  Daoud said that he told 
Alami that Ariana could only be saved if it was partially or 
fully privatized.  Daoud reported his impression that under 
the administration of Minister Sadeq, Ariana,s functions 
were undermined by a web of patronage jobs, aircraft 
rerouting for VIP charters, extremely weak management and 
technical expertise, and enormous numbers of redundant public 
employees.  Daoud added that Ariana had not maintained a 
balance sheet in 21 years. 
 
3. (C) Daoud felt that only through either partial or 
complete transferral of Ariana to private hands would genuine 
management improvements, job creation and technological 
advancement be possible.  Alami delayed repeatedly until the 
recent &decision8 that all planes must be owned in advance 
of licensing.  (Note: The state of the civil aviation sector 
can be illustrated through additional recent examples.  Daoud 
told of one Panjshiri Afghan who ) reportedly with help from 
Defense Minister Fahim - was able to travel to India for 
Airbus pilot training, which he failed.  Nonetheless, he then 
recruited an American friend to conduct a totally invalid 
&free-lance check-out8 for him in Afghanistan, and was 
issued a pilot,s license.  This individual currently flies 
for Ariana.  Another example is the dismal performance of the 
Civil Aviation Ministry,s candidates for Air Traffic Control 
Training in the U.S.  Of 19 hand-picked candidates taking a 
USG-sponsored English aptitude test in Kabul on April 14, 
none passed ) with the highest score a 38 out of a possible 
100.  Finally, Daoud noted that during his own Ariana flight 
from Frankfurt, 30-40 passengers were sitting in the aisles 
of the aircraft.  Endnote.) 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador asked why Daoud had not asked the 
Embassy for help earlier.  Daoud said he tried calling a few 
times from the U.S. without success, but decided that to 
solve this problem he needed to come to Kabul.  Daoud 
continued bashing Ariana for some time, alleging that one of 
its pilots was a former gunrunner for Ahmad Shah Masood and 
that Ariana planes frequently transported drug money.  Daoud 
recounted that Finance Minister Ghani had suggested that 
Ariana could be auctioned.  Daoud scoffed at this suggestion, 
noting that he had heard that Ghani,s brother, through 
intimidation and improper influence, had won similar rigged 
auctions in the recent past.  The Ambassador responded that 
Heshmat Ghani might indeed be corrupt, but that Minister 
Ghani kept him at a distance and certainly did not condone 
his activities.  Daoud replied that the father of both 
Heshmat and Ashraf Ghani was well known for corruption, which 
tainted the entire family.  According to Daoud, &one or two 
people are stifling everything8. 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador agreed that much of the government was 
still locked in old Soviet-era thinking about economic 
matters.  The legacy of decades of state control of the 
economy, he added, continues to slow the pace of necessary 
economic reforms, and privatization reforms are among these. 
Daoud wants now to actively seek USG support for his efforts 
and noted he was planning to obtain an all-Boeing fleet for 
Oxus Airlines.

SUBJECT: SE KHALILZAD\'S APRIL 11 MEETING WITH FM ABDULLAH 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: During his April 11 meeting with FM Abdullah, 
SE Khalilzad addressed both regional and domestic Afghan 
developments.  Khalilzad suggested that the renewed activity 
of the Taliban and other destabilizing elements in the South 
might be addressed through a trilateral 
(U.S.-Afghan-Pakistani) working group.  Abdullah responded 
favorably to this proposal, noting he welcomed improving 
relations with Pakistan.  Khalilzad also sought Abdullah,s 
views on priority domestic issues that demanded immediate 
attention.  FM Abdullah suggested that the top three priority 
issues were ensuring successful results for the 
Constitutional Commission, the Election Commission, and 
ANA/NDS reform.  End Summary. 
 
============================== 
SE Khalilzad Offers Trilateral 
Working Group Proposal 
============================== 
 
2. (C) SE Khalilzad met with Afghan FM Abdullah on April 11 
to review conditions in Afghanistan.  Accompanying Khalilzad 
were the Ambassador, NSC,s Rebecca Hanson, DOD/OSD,s 
Mustafa Popal and Econ/Commoff (notetaker).  SE Khalilzad 
began discussions by noting his concern about the poor state 
of Afghan-Pakistan relations.  The recent killing of an ICRC 
worker in Kandahar and reported Pakistani and Taliban 
cross-border incursions were of great concern to Washington. 
SE Khalilzad proposed a trilateral arrangement as a means to 
address this growing problem.  He proposed further that 
CJTF-180 commander, General McNeill, could head a high-level 
standing committee which would meet monthly.  Others could 
form a working-level body that could meet more frequently. 
The goal of these trilateral arrangements would be to stop 
all Taliban activities in Afghanistan.  Khalilzad noted he 
had not yet proposed this idea to President Karzai and hoped 
to get the FM,s views first. 
 
3. (C) Abdullah responded that concern was indeed growing 
over Taliban activities in Afghanistan.  In Ghazni, for 
example, the Taliban had time to establish a network and 
launch concerted operations recently.  This level of 
organization worried Abdullah.  Abdullah noted that Pakistan 
complained about negative perceptions of Pakistan and poor 
Afghan treatment of Pashtuns in Afghanistan.  The FM noted it 
would take time to reverse such feelings, but that this 
process would not be helped by such activities as the Taliban 
and Pakistan were reportedly engaged in.  Abdullah reported 
that security forces in the South were now acting to 
destabilize the region. 
 
4. (C) According to Abdullah, President Musharraf had 
complained of Indian covert destabilization activities in 
southern Afghanistan through the Indian consulate in 
Kandahar.  Abdullah,s opinion was that India was unlikely to 
engage in such activity, and had merely established its 
presence to promote its growing (mostly commercial) interests 
in Afghanistan.  India was active in Afghanistan, Abdullah 
noted, including a promised donation of trucks and an offer 
of military training to the ANA, building the Zaranj-Delaram 
road, and a $70m assistance pledge.  Abdullah welcomed 
Pakistan balancing this commitment from their side and 
Pakistan,s involvement in Afghanistan, but rejected any 
notion that Pakistan could &veto8 Indian activities here. 
Abdullah concluded that establishing military and 
intelligence-led trilateral discussions was the best way to 
begin addressing these issues.  The diplomatic channel, he 
added, obliged parties to &take sides8 on these issues. 
Ambassador noted that the diplomatic channel was, however, 
useful as a marker of progress. 
 
=============================== 
A Review f Domestic Conditions 
=============================== 
 
5. (C) SE Khalilzad, acknowledging that domestic issues were 
not the FM,s specific responsibility, then asked FM Abdullah 
for his view on current conditions inside Afghanistan. 
Khalilzad said that there was not as much progress in some 
areas as hoped, including the security sector generally, the 
progress of the national army, establishing a clear DDR 
policy, Ministry of Defense reform towards becoming a 
national organization, and limited progress on NDS (National 
Directorate of Security) reform. 
 
6. (S/NF) Abdullah agreed that there had been less progress 
than hoped for in these areas.  The FM noted that 
misunderstandings between OMC and General Baryalai over 
organizational models for the ANA had caused some delays. 
Abdullah noted that models for ANA organizational 
arrangements must be adapted to fit Afghan circumstances. 
Further, greater levels of support from the local leadership 
was needed to recruit soldiers from Kandahar and Jalalabad, 
which was critical to establishing the required ethnic 
diversity of the ANA.  Turning to DDR, Abdullah noted that 
practical and political considerations were involved in the 
selection of the first effected regions ) early success was 
key to this effort.  An apparent misunderstanding over the 
appropriate numbers of forces involved and whether NDS 
operations would be fully funded by the U.S had also slowed 
reform of NDS.  These NDS issues were now apparently 
resolved, and according to Abdullah, NDS Chief Aref had told 
him reform was ready to move forward. 
 
7. (C) Abdullah then turned to the controversy over 
appropriate methods of holding the annual celebration 
(&jashn8) of the Mujaheddin victory over the Soviets.  The 
main concern was whether the ANA ) rather than Mujaheddin 
fighters exclusively - would march in this event,s parade. 
Abdullah recommended that the ANA should participate to 
illustrate its role as a national military force.  The 
Ambassador noted he was aware of this issue and said the 
parade should not take place.  He had discussed this with 
President Karzai twice, and told him that an all-Mujaheddin 
event would send the wrong signal at the wrong time ) with 
elections coming up and the constitution being drafted. 
Further, it was a violation of the Bonn Agreement.  The 
Ambassador suggested that a celebration of peace, rather than 
a military event, might be more appropriate.  Abdullah noted 
that last year,s celebrations were &too military8, but 
added that it was not simply a matter of Kabul,s 
celebrations - this event would be celebrated in cities 
throughout Afghanistan.  Ambassador noted that the character 
of the celebration would be a key issue. 
 
8. (C) Abdullah then turned to Taliban activities in the 
provinces, reporting that they were very focused on the 
provinces.  The Taliban knows what,s happening in Zabol, he 
added, but we do not.  Abdullah also offered his assessment 
on the 2004 elections, reflecting pessimism that the work of 
the Constitutional Commission was proceeding quickly enough. 
SE Khalilzad suggested that the U.S. and Afghan governments 
needed to decide on a set of high priority issues to work on 
closely together.  Khalilzad warned that criticism would grow 
unless progress accelerated, and that a mechanism for 
addressing these priority issues was needed.  Khalilzad asked 
Abdullah for his recommendation of the top two or three items 
which needed to be brought to closure.  Abdullah quickly 
suggested the following priorities: 1) the Constitutional 
Commission, 2) the Election Commission, and 3) ANA/NDS 
reform.  SE Khalilzad shared his concern over the level of 
cooperation from the MOD, noting that MOD reform was key to 
many other areas.  The Ambassador added that we needed to 
stress continued U.S. commitment to remaining engaged in 
Afghanistan and our strong support of reforms.  If such 
reforms happen, we need to continue our support for the 
reformed organizations so that they will not be left 
isolated.  Ambassador added his view that the NDS reform will 
ultimately be successful.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S APRIL 8 MEETING WITH PRIVATIZATION 
COMMISSION CHAIRMAN KHALIQ FAZAL 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) On April 8, Ambassador met with Privatization 
Commission Chairman and former Minister of Public Works, 
Khaliq Fazal.  Fazal,s comments focused on deteriorating 
security conditions around Kandahar, infiltration of 
Pakistanis in the south, political demands on President 
Karzai, and the regrettably stalled work to assess 
Afghanistan,s state-owned enterprises.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Fazal told Ambassador that many Afghans maintained to 
him during his visit to Kandahar the previous week that the 
Taliban were gradually restoring power bases in the south and 
alleged that elements of the local military (governor 
Sherzai,s forces) were &somehow involved.8  Locals were 
unwilling to make their concerns too public out of fear that 
the central government would be unable to protect them. 
Fazal added that Pakistanis were &everywhere8, working as 
engineers and construction labor, and questioned why these 
jobs were not made available to local Afghans.  Fazal told 
Ambassador that he had urged President Karzai upon his return 
to Kabul to reinforce border security and appoint qualified 
leaders to replace the wayward leadership. 
 
3. (C) Karzai, Fazal claimed, agreed, but did not indicate 
any action he might take.  Fazal said that Karzai needed to 
take strong action to avoid losing popular support.  Fazal 
added that Karzai,s loss of support would also erode popular 
support for the U.S., which was already strained by the war 
in Iraq.  Ambassador agreed that the Afghan people needed to 
see results to maintain the Karzai administration,s 
standing. Ambassador affirmed that the U.S. remained strongly 
behind Afghanistan, noting that both CENTCOM General Franks 
and SE Khalilzad were coming to Kabul to reaffirm this 
commitment later in the week. 
 
4. (C) Fazal turned the conversation to the next year,s 
election, noting that supporters had asked him to form a 
pro-democracy party.  He felt it was too early for this, as 
the elections law was still incomplete, but asked the 
Ambassador his view.  The Ambassador replied that it was not 
necessary to wait for the final election law to be completed 
before forming political parties.  Ambassador added that he 
hoped parties would be formed and that NDI and IRI were 
helping in this regard. 
 
5. (C) Fazal then noted that resentment was building towards 
expatriate Afghans, like himself, who had returned to 
Afghanistan after long residence abroad.  The Ambassador said 
that while he was impressed by the dedication of those 
Afghans who remained in their country, all Afghans were now 
working to help rebuild their homeland.  Fazal said that the 
resentment towards &carpetbaggers8 was understandable, as 
even the Cabinet had not been paid in ten months.  Fazal 
noted that the expat-Afghans would &be finished if Americans 
leave8 and that the destruction and possible division of 
Afghanistan could follow.  Ambassador expressed his 
conviction that the fundamentalists and others resisting 
political and economic progress in Afghanistan would not 
prevail.  Fazal stressed that building economic capacity was 
critical to this, and that he should hear for himself from 
local Afghan entrepreneurs and traders what the challenges 
were.  Ambassador agreed and a readout of this later meeting 
will be reported septel. 
 
6.  (C) Fazal concluded by reporting that his commission had 
completed their assessment of 85 percent of Afghanistan,s 
176 state-owned enterprises.  Fazal would like to receive 
technical assistance to complete this assessment and act upon 
its findings, but repeated an earlier contention that Finance 
Minister Ghani had told USAID not to assist him in this 
regard.  The Ambassador assured Fazal that USAID did want to 
help and agreed to turn his attention to this matter.  (Note: 
USAID Kabul Economic Governance Program Officer confirmed 
that Ghani has indeed advised them not to proceed with 
privatization technical assistance efforts generally, 
although no specific instructions were given not to work with 
Fazal.  According to USAID Kabul, Ghani,s position may be 
based inter alia on distrust of Fazal and on Ghani,s desire 
to personally control the process.  Endnote.)

SUBJECT: SE KHALILZAD\'S APRIL 11 MEETING WITH NDS CHIEF 
ENGINEER AREF 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (S/NF) Summary: SE Khalilzad met on April 11 with National 
Directorate of Security (NDS) Chief Engineer Aref to discuss 
current security conditions, his views on proposed 
US-Afghan-Pakistan trilateral discussions, and to review NDS 
reform.  Aref told SE Khalilzad that Pakistan was indeed 
promoting instability in Afghanistan and that trilateral 
discussions might offer a way to address these activities. 
Aref reported that security conditions were generally good, 
but that the central government still lacked authority in the 
provinces.  Also, the NSC, as a new institution on the Afghan 
scene, was struggling to find its appropriate role and assert 
its authority on security matters within the Cabinet. 
Finally, Aref noted that the appropriate strategy for NDS 
reform had been worked out with US assistance.  End summary. 
 
2. (S/NF) SE Khalilzad met with NDS Chief Engineer Aref on 
April 11.  Khalilzad was accompanied by Ambassador, COS, 
NSC,s Rebecca Hanson, DOD/OSD,s Mustafa Popal and 
Econ/Commoff (notetaker).  Khalilzad said his perception was 
that the security situation was generally good, but that the 
Taliban was regrouping.  Khalilzad asked Aref his views in 
this regard, and solicited his views on Afghan security 
conditions and assessment of NDS reform.  Khalilzad also 
proposed a trilateral military-intel working group 
(Afghan-Pakistani-US) to address Taliban and extremist 
activities in Afghanistan. Engaging Pakistan to cease its 
support of extremist activities was one main goal of this 
working group, SE Khalilzad said. 
 
3. (S/NF) Aref noted that ISI activities in Afghanistan were 
still a problem, and that such ISI officers are deliberately 
promoting extremism against Afghanistan.  Peshawar-based ISI 
Officers including Sultan and General Wahid were tasking 
Afghans to work against the Afghan central government.  Aref 
alleged that ISI agents/assets working in Kandahar and 
Jalalabad were providing free passage to terror elements to 
cross into and out of Pakistan in vehicles loaded with arms. 
Aref said this showed that Pakistan did not recognize Kabul 
as Afghanistan,s central authority.  (Note: Aref alleged 
that 6,000 &safe passage8 permits for Afghan commanders had 
been issued ) NFI.)  In light of these activities, Aref 
agreed that trilateral talks were a good idea, and could 
supplement other contacts planned with ISI ) NFI.  SE 
Khalilzad noted he would raise the possibility of opening 
this trilateral channel with President Karzai during 
discussions over NDS reform. 
 
4. (S/NF) Aref said security had undoubtedly improved 
compared to the previous year.  The NDS had begun many new 
projects with American assistance.  According to Aref, 90 
percent of their efforts had been successful, but five to ten 
percent of enemy plans had succeeded (including sabotage and 
provoking provincial tribes against the central government). 
Aref noted that the enemy program to assassinate key leaders 
) including President Karzai and Minister of Defense Fahim 
) was still in place.  Aref noted that the war in Iraq had 
inspired the madrassas to increase propaganda for jihad 
against Americans and the &infidel8 Karzai government.  In 
addition to propaganda, the Taliban had attempted small-scale 
attacks (e.g., in Zormat and Kandahar).  Aref noted that NDS 
foiled these attacks, adding that the Taliban strategy was to 
find isolated pockets and manipulate the local population. 
 
5. (S/NF) Aref said that the Afghan government had certain 
political weaknesses.  It has not been able to assert its 
control over the provinces, and is not even in the position 
to fire bad governors.  Aref said that, nonetheless, the 
government had many achievements ) especially in the 
security sector ) but more was needed to improve the lives 
of Afghans.  We cannot simply police them, Aref said, and 
nothing else.  Aref added that the National Security Council 
structure was a completely new experience in Afghanistan, and 
that it would take time to find is place and appropriate role 
in the system.  The NSC was discussing how to incorporate 
Ismail Khan and General Dostum into the government in Kabul. 
Aref thought a solution would help improve security 
conditions in the south as well.  In general, Aref continued, 
there are internal and external threats.  Of the internal 
threats, Aref emphasized the reluctance of certain prominent 
elements within the Cabinet to implement the decisions of the 
NSC.  Aref noted he had passed messages about this to both 
the President and ORCA, as U.S. lives were also at stake. 
Aref added that sometimes the government makes a decision 
that is not well communicated to other parts of the 
government. 
 
6. (S/NF) Aref said that clashes within the government were 
not based upon ethnic or political differences ) as some 
thought.  He offered the example of Minister Jalali, who was 
an expatriate and a Pashtun, with whom he has quickly 
established a good working relationship.  Jalali is given 
broad license to interact with NDS elements without first 
receiving clearances through Aref.  Aref offered one solution 
to some of the problems discussed.  His suggestion was to 
make former King Zahir Shah more effective.  The former king 
enjoys respect and wants to help unify the nation, 
particularly with problems in the South.

SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR UPDATE - 
APRIL 2003 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) The Ministry of Communications (MOC) is facing an 
assortment of challenges as the government of President 
Karzai enters the Afghan year 1382.  The Ministry,s 
relations with its sole telecom service provider, Afghan 
Wireless Communications Company (AWCC), continue to 
deteriorate while a second service provider led by the Aga 
Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED), is preparing to 
launch operations.  The Ministry of Communications is 
planning to unveil yet another strategy for developing a 
transparent and progressive telecom sector in early May ) 
which may even include plans for partial privatization of 
this sector.  For now, the government has decided to take a 
wait-and-see approach to privatization generally.  The Afghan 
government cites national security, national prestige, and 
instability caused by dislocation of public workers as 
factors in delaying privatization.  Ironically, two different 
roads to partial privatization for telecoms are available - 
both with little to no political risk.  An AWCC buy-out of 
the MOC,s 20 percent share of its stock, or MOC taking on a 
minority partner to help modernize and expand Afghanistan,s 
state-owned telecom sector both offer safe, albeit limited, 
privatization opportunities.  Meanwhile, the MOC is preparing 
to issue two new invitations to tender in coming weeks.  End 
summary. 
 
=================================== 
Background on Afghan Telecom Sector 
=================================== 
 
2. (SBU) The existing service provider, Afghan Wireless 
Communications Company (AWCC), began service in Afghanistan 
in 1998 as Telephone Systems International (TSI).  TSI 
contracted their Afghan operations out to a U.K. firm during 
the Taliban sanctions period from 1999 to 2001.  In 2001, the 
Rabbani government (based probably upon its legal standing as 
holder of Afghanistan,s UN seat and most of its embassies 
around the world, although at the time it controlled perhaps 
only 15 percent of Afghanistan,s territory) ratified TSI,s 
license.  AWCC was then formed in 2001 to operate the 
wireless telecom (GSM) system.  It was (and still is) 80 
percent owned by TSI and 20 percent owned by the MOC. 
 
3. (C) After a highly controversial bidding process for a 
second Generalized System for Mobiles (GSM) license in the 
latter half of 2002, (which involved the abrupt cancellation 
of the first invitation to tender and allegations of bribery, 
kickbacks, conflicts of interest and non-transparent 
tendering on the second invitation to tender), the MOC 
awarded a license to the AKFED consortium (which included the 
Aga Khan Foundation as its largest stakeholder).  According 
to AWCC, which did not bid on the second GSM license, the MOC 
notified AWCC during this lengthy bidding process that their 
license would no longer be exclusive and must be modified to 
reflect terms identical to those in the AKFED license. 
 
============================================= ======= 
AWCC Claims Effective Expropriation of Assets by MOC 
============================================= ======= 
 
4. (C) Officials from the Afghan Wireless Communications 
Corporation met with the Ambassador on April 4 to voice their 
growing concerns about their troubled relations with the MOC 
and seek his help.  Relations between AWCC and the MOC have 
been strained during the entire tenure of Communications 
Minister Stanakzai as reported previously.  Now, according to 
AWCC officials, the Ministry had imposed severe conditions on 
AWCC for license renewal, and had established a seemingly 
arbitrary April 23 deadline for compliance.  The provisions 
the MOC is seeking as conditions for license renewal include: 
Dissolution of the existing license; transfer of an 
additional 20 percent ownership stake to MOC without 
compensation (raising the MOC,s ownership share in AWCC to 
40 percent); transfer of one-third of international incoming 
call revenues; control of the AWCC Board of Directors; 
authority to appoint AWCC management; the settlement of an 
existing legal dispute between AWCC/TSI and its former U.K. 
subcontractor and several other taxes and conditions.  The 
AWCC reps asserted they are facing far more stringent 
conditions than AKFED did.  They were unable to confirm this 
disparity, however, as the MOC has not allowed AWCC to review 
the AKFED license. 
 
5. (C) AWCC claims 35,000 subscribers, operates in four 
cities with another pending, (Jalalabad service is reportedly 
being held up by the MOC), has made a claimed $70 million 
investment in the GSM network, employs over 600 local 
employees, and creates a $500,000 monthly expenditure in the 
local economy.  Substantial upgrading and expansion are 
planned for 2003.  The AWCC reps claimed that the MOC,s 
actions constitute a partial expropriation of their 
substantial private investment in Afghanistan.  They further 
claimed that the attorneys representing the MOC are very 
unsophisticated regarding telecommunications regulation and 
practice, and did not even realize the sum of their actions 
constituted effective expropriation until they were advised 
of this outcome.  Based upon the urgency of their situation 
and their investment at stake, they requested the Ambassador 
speak with appropriate Afghan government officials to prevent 
this pending expropriation.  Otherwise, they claimed they 
would have no alternative but to cease further investment and 
pull out of Afghanistan.  (Note: With the AKFED Consortium 
still months away from commencing operations, this would 
leave Afghanistan with virtually no phone service at all for 
the near term.  End note.) 
 
6. (C) The AWCC reps noted that Minister Stanakzai, despite 
trying to reach some compromise, appeared unable to balance 
his conflicting roles as policy-maker, government official, 
regulator, and shareholder.  They suggested one solution 
would be for the government to sell their 20 percent 
ownership stake to AWCC and get out of the business side of 
telecommunications entirely.  This &de facto8 partial 
privatization could send a positive signal to international 
investors. 
 
7. (C) The Ambassador raised the issue of possible 
expropriation during a meeting with President Karzai on April 
4.  Karzai was alarmed and understood the disastrous effect 
an expropriation would have on Afghanistan,s potential to 
attract foreign investment.  The Ambassador raised the 
possibility of &privatizing8 the MOC,s 20 percent 
ownership stake in AWCC through sale to AWCC.  President 
Karzai agreed that privatization was a good idea for telecoms 
and wondered why the Afghan government was involved in this 
sector at all.  Nonetheless, it was unclear what action 
President Karzai was prepared to take. 
 
============================== 
TDA-funded Consultant Bashes 
AWCC, Discusses Privatization, 
and Notes Upcoming Tenders 
============================== 
 
8. (C) On April 10, Econ/Commoff met with Ken Zita, (please 
protect) a TDA-funded telecom advisor to the Ministry of 
Communications, to review sector developments.  When the 
subject of AWCC was raised, Zita said AWCC was &probably the 
worst phone company anywhere in the world8.  He strongly 
disputed AWCC,s claim of a 98 percent call completion rate. 
(Note: Embassy can confirm that.  For whole days there is no 
AWCC service at all; other days perhaps one-third of calls 
made do not get through.  The joke around Kabul is AWCC 
stands for &Always Waiting, Can,t Connect8.  End note.) 
Zita maintained that the poor performance of AWCC had become 
a major liability and embarrassment to the Afghan government. 
 Contrary to AWCC,s claims that it has tried to cooperate 
with the Ministry of Commerce, Zita said AWCC had failed to 
rectify &not insignificant8 problems with the wireless 
network, despite being &put on notice8 as early as July 
2002 by the MOC.  He reported just having come from a meeting 
between the Minister and AWCC reps in which the Minister 
&escalated8 matters.  Stanakzai reportedly gave AWCC 20 
days to comply with the MOC conditions or their license would 
be revoked.  Zita noted that he had kept an open mind about 
AWCC since he first visited Afghanistan in April 2002, but 
that his opinion of the firm had declined steadily. 
 
9. (C) According to Zita, AWCC had not accomplished enough in 
the past year, offered poor and relatively expensive service, 
and &no one believes they,ve actually invested as much as 
they say they have8.  To increase the public pressure on 
AWCC, Minister Stanakzai announced publicly on April 14 that 
AWCC has three months to improve service or have their 
license revoked.  According to other Kabul sources, to drive 
home the message, one of AWCC,s management was detained on 
April 13 by the Ministry of Defense and ordered to improve 
service within ten days or face arrest.  Minister Stanakzai 
denies his Ministry was involved in the MOD action.  (Note: 
Of course, AWCC maintains that MOC obstruction and lack of 
support from the MOC were a major obstacle to their 
operations.  It is worth noting Zita was unaware and 
surprised that the MOC had refused to show AWCC the AKFED 
contract their license conditions were to match.  This last 
point is especially important if AKFED turns out to be 100 
percent privately owned.  This would greatly strengthen the 
AWCC position for buying out the MOC,s 20 percent share. 
End note.) 
 
10. (C) Turning to more positive matters, Zita noted that two 
telecom invitations to tender were scheduled to be announced 
in roughly two to three weeks.  The first tender would 
request bids for a management contract to establish a 
wireless local loop system in 11 cities.  The second tender 
was for the establishment of an International Satellite 
Gateway system.  (Note: As further information on these 
tenders becomes available, Embassy will pass along.  For the 
time being, relevant Washington agencies are requested to 
inform potentially interested U.S. firms.  Endnote.) 
 
11. (C) Econ/Commoff asked if the MOC had any plans to 
privatize Afghanistan,s telecom sector holdings ) which the 
Ministry would like to run as an independent SOE named 
&AfghanTel8.  AfghanTel would maintain the existing 40,000 
landlines and 5,400 public employees  (Comment: One employee 
for every 8 phones ) incredible!  End comment.)   Zita said 
he had advised the Minister that the Afghan telecom sector 
should be privatized, but noted that the Minister wanted to 
maintain state control.  The reasons he cited were: first, 
national security; second, national branding (i.e., 
prestige), and third, the desire to avoid any dislocations 
caused by widespread layoffs in the run-up to elections.  The 
International Telecommunications Union advisor working with 
the Minister, Mr. Sangin, also opposed near-term 
privatization of telecoms. 
 
12. (C) Zita suggested that private firms would probably have 
no interest in taking ownership of the existing telecom 
structure of AfghanTel.  Severance packages for displaced 
workers could even be included in private bids for telecom 
operations.  Most importantly, however, AfghanTel,s real 
value was its land holdings, which included 423 post offices, 
switching stations and rights-of-way throughout the country. 
Access to such land would offer tremendous commercial 
opportunities in telecommunications and other sectors for 
prospective bidders.  Despite the capacity to raise 
substantial assets and improve service through the 
privatization of AfghanTel, strong resistance remained. 
 
13. (C) Econ/Commoff noted that it was hard to see where the 
telecom sector was headed, and asked Zita if there was a plan 
for future development of the sector.  Zita replied that he 
was working on such a plan for presentation to the Minister 
by the end of April and would suggest publication of the new 
policy in mid-May. 
 
===================================== 
Future Options for Afghan Telecoms: 
Early Partial Privatization Suggested 
===================================== 
 
14. (SBU) On April 13, Zita sent an e-mail to the Minister 
and his advisors at the MOC outlining &Options for 
AfghanTel8 and provided a copy to the Embassy.  The e-mail 
details the difficulties facing AfghanTel within an open and 
competitive marketplace and is summarized here to indicate 
the aspects of the internal dialogue going on within the 
Afghan Ministry of Communications.  Zita notes AfghanTel will 
require investment capital to match its private sector 
competitors, and will be unlikely to raise these funds 
through either private borrowing or donor assistance.  Zita 
added that the ITU advisor, Mr. Sangin has suggested 
privatizing a minority position in AfghanTel &over time8, 
without a specific timetable.  Zita warned that if AfghanTel 
enters the market - especially with only limited financial 
resources - any failure to perform ) or to compete 
effectively ) might have a direct, negative impact on the 
credibility of the government. 
 
15. (C) Zita continued, noting that engaging a management 
partner would offset operational risk and improve generation 
of cash.  Zita acknowledged that maintaining majority state 
ownership of AfghanTel is politically important (for the 
reasons outlined above).  Under the circumstances, Zita 
recommended the immediate sale of a minority interest in 
AfghanTel (to a firm able to provide management and/or 
technical expertise and access to capital) as an alternative 
to a &wait-and-see8 timetable for privatization.  In this 
immediate partial privatization scenario, the investor would 
purchase a minority block of shares (25 percent) with an 
option to purchase up to 49 percent (or more) in the future. 
Zita concluded that telecom is &almost always a 
privatization pioneer in any country8 and that &no other 
sector is better suited to lead the way8. 
 
======= 
Comment 
======= 
 
16. (C) Appropriate development of the Afghan telecom sector 
could serve as a major revenue and job generator for the 
fragile Afghan government.  Privatization in telecom could 
also help generate revenue and smooth the path for future 
partial or full state-owned enterprises (SOE) privatizations. 
 The Afghan Cabinet reportedly debated privatization of 
telecoms on April 12 and decided to wait for the present. 
While the result is not what we had hoped, the fact that such 
a Cabinet debate took place is a healthy sign.  The merits of 
 privatization versus continued state control are being 
actively considered at the MOC, although it remains unclear 
whether economic or political considerations are paramount. 
While a partial expropriation of AWCC/TSI would represent a 
disaster for Afghanistan,s image, a partial privatization of 
AfghanTel would be a major boost. 
 
17. (C) The MOC allowing AWCC/TSI to buy out their 20 percent 
share would enhance perceptions of Afghanistan,s business 
climate even further.  Perhaps the notion of allowing 
AWCC/TSI to buy out the 20 percent stake would face 
resistance in light of AWCC,s alleged poor performance over 
the past year.  AWCC,s position will be considerably 
strengthened, however, if it turns out AKFED,s license 
conditions include 100 percent private ownership.  The 
&privatization8 of the 20 percent MOC share of AWCC would 
be virtually without political risk as all AWCC employees are 
private and not public employees.  AWCC has even agreed, if 
national branding/prestige is a consideration, to change 
their name to remove the identification with Afghanistan. 
 
18. (C) There is at least some reason to hope a more 
progressive and transparent telecom policy will be enacted 
soon and that the stated goal of delineating the MOC,s 
current multiple roles and possible scenarios for at least 
some telecom privatization will be part of this urgently 
needed reform.  If so, a fully private AWCC/TSI and a 
partially privatized AfghanTel would have to compete in an 
open telecom market with new entrants, improving telecom 
service and access for the Afghan population.  The Embassy 
will continue to advocate strongly for privatization and open 
competition as general themes, and particularly focus our 
privatization message on the Afghan telecom sector.

SUBJECT: CONGRESSMAN ROHRABACHER\'S APRIL 16 MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT KARZAI 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: On April 16, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher met 
with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.  Rohrabacher was 
accompanied by his spouse, Ambassador and Econ/Comofficer 
(notetaker).  Congressman Rohrabacher began by assuring 
Karzai that the war in Iraq had not diverted attention from 
Afghanistan.  Rather, his message in Washington was that both 
efforts were part of the same war on terrorism.  Rohrabacher 
added that even fiscally frugal members of Congress look upon 
funds in support of Afghanistan as war expenditures and not 
aid expenditures.  Rohrabacher noted, however, that he needed 
to speak frankly with Karzai about the pace of 
counter-narcotic efforts and the strategy for addressing 
warlordism.  Rohrabacher pointed out that pressure was 
building in Congress to link Afghan government poppy 
eradication efforts with levels of aid.  Karzai was surprised 
by this concern, as he was under the impression that poppy 
eradication was proceeding well.  Rohrabacher also pressed 
Karzai to integrate the warlords ) whom he referred to as 
&ethnic leaders8 ) into the central government by pursuing 
a federalist decentralization of power.  Karzai strongly 
disagreed with both Rohrabacher,s premise of &ethnic 
leaders8 as suitable local authorities and his conclusion 
that federalism was the appropriate solution for 
Afghanistan,s fractured polity.  End summary. 
 
========================= 
Pressure Building to Link 
Aid and Anti-Drug Efforts 
========================= 
 
2. (C) Rohrabacher indicated that aid to Afghanistan was 
still seen by Congress as a battleground in the war against 
terror.  This meant that, despite the intense global 
attention raised by the war in Iraq, Congress did not plan to 
divert funds or attention from Afghan reconstruction efforts. 
 After providing this reassurance, Rohrabacher said he needed 
to speak frankly about two issues of importance. 
3. (C) The first issue was the potential political liability 
of Afghanistan,s recent resumption of its place as number 
one producer of narcotics.  In a presidential election year, 
Rohrabacher was concerned that the administration would find 
it increasingly difficult to support funding the leading 
source country for the heroin reaching America,s streets. 
He was also concerned that political rivals of the 
administration would make an embarrassing election issue out 
of this situation.  President Karzai reacted with surprise, 
asking Rohrabacher if those with such views realized that the 
Afghan government was working hard to eradicate and reduce 
poppy production.  In his view, the poppy and heroin problem 
was under control.  The real key to solving this problem 
conclusively was finalizing road and alternative livelihoods 
projects.  Rohrabacher responded that the strong mood of 
Congress ) based largely on the notable increase in poppy 
production during the last year ) was to begin scaling back 
funding to Afghanistan. 
 
4. (C) Karzai, still taken aback by this sentiment, asked 
Rohrabacher,  &Is the war on terror even over, that we can 
now turn our full attention to the war on drugs?8 
Rohrabacher suggested that a poppy eradication program using 
planes spraying appropriate herbicides could wipe out half 
the existing poppy crop.  Not specifically responding to this 
proposal, Karzai replied that it was his impression that 
Afghan-British counter-drug efforts had already eradicated 60 
percent of this year,s poppy production ) resulting in 
substantial eradication of the first and second poppy 
harvests of this season.  Karzai said that the local 
populations of traditional poppy growing areas did not resist 
eradication efforts.  What worried Karzai far more were the 
new poppy cultivation regions, such as Takhar and Bamiyan, 
which began production only this year.  These new areas were 
a result of a policy error, Karzai said, noting that 
counter-drug efforts should never have included paying 
farmers to destroy their crops.  This had resulted in 
increased production in both traditional and new cultivation 
regions in anticipation of transfer payments for destruction. 
 We are paying for that mistake now, Karzai concluded. 
 
5. (C) Rohrabacher returned to his poppy spraying proposal, 
emphasizing to Karzai that he must be ready to take strong 
action to destroy poppies.  Rohrabacher asked Karzai for a 
letter of no objection ) which he could present to Congress 
if controversy arose ) to proceed with spraying.  This, 
Rohrabacher maintained, would demonstrate Karzai was willing 
to take whatever measures were necessary ) up to and 
including spraying ) to eradicate poppies.  Karzai,s Chief 
of Staff, Sayed Jawad raised the issue of environmental 
impact.  Rohrabacher agreed that the letter could contain a 
caveat regarding environmental impact. 
 
========================================= 
Warlords, &Ethnic Leaders8 and Federalism 
========================================= 
 
6. (C) Rohrabacher then turned to his second issue - which 
was finding an appropriate role for such figures as Jumbesh 
leader Abdul Rashid Dostum and Herat Governor Ismail Khan. 
Rohrabacher told Karzai that Operation Enduring Freedom was 
successful because Afghans were willing to fight hard to 
change the status quo.  Having reviewed the American 
military-only Afghan war plan, he was convinced that the 
coalition could not have prevailed without Afghan support. 
The Afghan leaders in the war effort were from different 
ethnic backgrounds.  &Warlords8 was an inappropriate term 
for these figures.  Rohrabacher preferred &ethnic leaders.8 
   Rohrabacher concluded that Afghanistan had always had 
powerful provincial figures and that Karzai had to find some 
way to incorporate these &ethnic leaders8 into the modern 
Afghan state. 
 
7. (C) Karzai was again surprised by this analysis.  He 
disagreed that Afghanistan had always been so decentralized. 
Rather, Karzai maintained, national institutions had enjoyed 
strong authority in the provinces before the past two decades 
of conflict.  Also, provincial tribal chiefs had 
traditionally maintained informal ties to the central 
government.  Karzai acknowledged that the central government 
did not interfere with local disputes, and left them to local 
councils to solve, limiting their interaction with the 
provinces to provision of roads, health and education and 
collection of taxes. 
 
8. (C) Rohrabacher told Karzai his challenge was to integrate 
the warlords, particularly Dostum, adding that the Afghan 
government &needs these people not to be a negative force 
but a positive force. 8  Rohrabacher offered the example of 
former king Zahir Shah, who had ruled for 40 years through 
compromise and co-optation of such figures in the past.  By 
decentralizing power in a federalist arrangement, the 
warlords would have an incentive to cooperate with the 
central government. 
 
9. (C) Karzai responded that the principal complaint of the 
Afghan people today was the TISA,s association with 
warlords.  Just a few days ago, Karzai added, a clash between 
Dostum and Atta,s forces in Mazar resulted in 17 dead.  The 
Afghan government, Karzai continued, is criticized because it 
allows the warlords to exist.  Karzai welcomed the continued 
presence of such figures in Afghanistan, but said they had no 
right to act outside the law, and must respect life and 
property.  Such &outlaw8 behavior had to end.  Rohrabacher 
replied that many of the Wild West,s most famous sheriffs 
were former outlaws, (e.g. Wyatt Earp), and that law and 
order was maintained in those times primarily by local 
militias. 
 
================================ 
Warlords and Fundamentalism: 
Two Sides of the Same False Coin 
================================ 
10. (C) Rohrabacher noted that Afghanistan still faced a 
major threat from radical Islam, which Rohrabacher concluded 
was allied with Pashtun Nationalism.  Therefore, cooperation 
with the Northern Alliance was essential as a counterforce, 
and the &Northern Alliance is not expendable.8  Karzai 
replied that conditions in Afghanistan, to the contrary, were 
much the same now as in 1994 before the advent of the 
Taliban, with local military commanders abusing and 
exploiting the population through force.  Rohrabacher noted 
that the decision to create the Taliban ) which Rohrabacher 
said included the Saudis, the U.S. and Pakistan ) was made 
to bring order to such chaos.  The decision at that time was 
between a return of the former King or the installation of a 
 &new force.8  This time, Rohrabacher concluded, it is 
important to do the right thing. 
 
11. (C) Again, Karzai disagreed.  Such warlords, which 
Rohrabacher suggested working with, were the very ones who 
facilitated the pre-Taliban disorder.  It was a fact that 
such warlords were able to operate in Afghanistan through 
U.S. support.  When the Taliban came, the people surrendered, 
as they wanted to be rid of the warlords.  Karzai warned that 
the Afghan government now has a chance to make the country 
better, or the Taliban would be back.  He added that he &was 
not giving the current situation another year.8  The 
warlords were killing, raping, looting, and stealing from the 
people ) including Ismail Khan and Dostum.  Already, the 
Taliban are back in Kandahar and the people are welcoming 
them.  Afghan government officials do not even feel safe 
traveling to the rural areas of Kandahar, Karzai reported. 
The reason Afghans in the provinces do not want federalism is 
expressly because the warlords will rule them in such an 
arrangement. 
 
12. (C) Karzai then turned his criticism to Rohrabacher,s 
perception that the Taliban were linked to Pashtun 
nationalism.  On the contrary, Karzai said, Pashtun 
nationalists were generally secular.  In fact, Karzai added, 
Pakistan had created the Taliban to fight against Pashtun 
nationalism.  When Pakistan was created 50 years ago, Karzai 
continued, the area inside Pakistan containing Pashtuns was 
divided from the Pashtuns on the Afghan side of the border. 
This Pashtun-dominated region was called &Pashtunistan. 8 
Fearing secession, Pakistan set out to destroy Pashtun 
nationalism by Islamicizing Pakistani Pashtuns and killing 
Afghan Pashtun nationalists.  Pakistan,s goal was to have 
Afghanistan dominated by radical Islam.  Pakistan also killed 
regional tribal leaders in the Pashtun areas.  To further 
this policy during the Soviet invasion period, Pakistan 
convinced the U.S. that radical Muslims were the ideal force 
to fight the Soviets.  As a result, the U.S. gave money to 
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and other radical Muslims to fight the 
Soviets, despite the fact that such radical Muslims had no 
Afghan following.  According to Karzai, &America realized 
its mistake in 1988,8 but it was too late. 
 
13. (C) Karzai noted that what the people really want is to 
live under law, and people are starting to complain that 
under the Taliban at least there was law and order. 
Rohrabacher said that whatever the ultimate division of local 
and central power in the Constitution, it is important that 
it provides for local elections.  Karzai reported that he had 
just received a report from Barnett Rubin, who had just 
completed a tour of the country.  This report stated that the 
people do not want federalism and that they fear the 
warlords.  The Hazaras were specifically cited as a community 
that fears a regional distribution of power.  Karzai 
concluded by saying that men like Dostum are not &ethnic 
leaders8 - they are warlords.  They are fighting among and 
killing local people of their own ethnic community. 
Rohrabacher replied that, in any case, it was important to 
allow local people to vote freely in local or national 
elections.  Karzai agreed.  On one condition, he added, that 
they vote without having a gun to their heads. 
 
14. (C) Karzai said that the Afghan people have given us (his 
government) a chance to change things.  The way he saw it, 
there were only three ways to guarantee free elections in 
2004: 1) to train the ANA and have them disarm the warlords; 
2) to expand ISAF and have them disarm the warlords; and 3) 
to take all the current leadership ) Karzai here included 
himself, the warlords and all others associated with the past 
) out of Afghanistan and let the people start fresh with 
newly elected leaders.  Rohrabacher replied that the second 
option was &very doable.8  Karzai concluded that there was 
still a chance for Afghanistan to abandon warlordism and 
looting.  Upon learning that Rohrabacher was scheduled to 
visit Dostum in Mazar the following day, Karzai asked 
Rohrabacher to be blunt with Dostum ) and stress to him that 
Afghanistan had been given a second chance and it had to 
change. 
 
15. (U) Congressman Rohrabacher did not have an opportunity 
to clear this cable before his departure.

SUBJECT: UPDATE ON FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL CEMENT PRODUCTION 
PROJECT 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 15. 
 
2. (C) Summary: From April 22 to 29, Texas-based Fidelity 
International was in Kabul to pursue a $1.8 billion cement 
deal with the Afghan government.  Substantial progress was 
made, including the granting of an investment license by the 
High Commission for Investment.  Given the size and impact of 
the proposed deal, the terms are being reviewed at the 
highest levels of the Afghan government.  Among the chief 
Afghan concerns was Fidelity,s request for market 
exclusivity that they perceive will create a &monopoly8 in 
the cement sector.  Fidelity, for its part, appears willing 
to negotiate but is growing frustrated by what it views as 
the Afghan government renegotiating the deal repeatedly due 
to unclear decision-making authority.  A four-minister Task 
Force led by the Minister of Reconstruction is currently 
preparing the Afghan government,s counterproposal to 
Fidelity,s terms.  The Task Force is scheduled to complete 
its work and offer its counterproposal o/a May 7.  Despite 
many ups and downs, the deal for this critically needed 
investment in a key reconstruction sector is still very much 
alive.  End Summary. 
 
3. (C) The principal investors from Fidelity International 
visited Kabul from April 22 to 29.  Fidelity International,s 
management team includes several of the American businessmen 
who made up the failed Box-Alcali cement investment proposal 
that has languished in the Ministry of Mines and Industries 
since March 2002.  The new firm, Fidelity, now includes W. 
Tompie Hall, whose experience includes reconstruction efforts 
in post-Gulf War Kuwait in the early 1990s.  Box 
International is now responsible for the feasibility study 
and the operation of the cement factories.  Box,s former 
Turkish joint venture partner, Alcali, is no longer involved 
in the project.  In advance of this visit, Fidelity 
Representatives Tompie Hall and Terry Ritter met with 
officials at the Departments of State and Commerce.  In 
addition, they made clear early on that they wanted to work 
closely with the Embassy ) an omission from the Box-Alcali 
proposal that they wished to remedy. 
 
4. (C) Substantial progress was made between 4/22 and 4/29. 
The negative feelings that the failed Box-Alcali deal had 
created were overcome.  (Note: The Box-Alcali deal rubbed 
both Minister Ghani and the late Minister of Mines and 
Industry Mohammedi the wrong way due to lease provisions 
which conveyed the required land for one dollar.  Also, the 
Alcali side of the deal employed a purported fixer who 
misrepresented his influence with the Afghan government and 
raised suspicions of Box-Alcali,s legitimacy through his 
clumsy application of political pressure.  End note.)  The 
Fidelity team met early on with the Ambassador and the 
Minister of Commerce.  The Minister of Commerce discussed the 
message immediately with President Karzai, who strongly 
supported the project.  Karzai appointed Minister of 
Reconstruction Farhang to finalize the deal. 
 
5. (C) Minister Farhang convened a meeting on April 23 to 
hear the proposal,s terms in detail and raise preliminary 
points requiring further discussion.  In addition to 
Fidelity,s senior and in-country representatives and 
Econ/Commoff, also attending were Acting Minister of Mines 
and Industry Nadi, Minister of Commerce Kazemi and working 
level representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and the Ministry of Planning.  Fidelity presented its 
proposal, which called for the creation of the National 
Afghan Cement Company, in which the Afghan Government would 
hold a 15 percent share.  The project was set to begin with a 
program for rehabilitating one of the two defunct state-owned 
cement factories in Pol-e Khomri while concurrently 
conducting feasibility studies for the construction of three 
other cement factories in other regions of the country. 
Fidelity was prepared to provide a 25MW power plant for each 
factory.  In addition, Fidelity was prepared to develop, 
excavate and transport required raw materias ) all of which 
it was prepared to pay for at fair market rates.  Fidelity 
estimated that the project would create 8,000 direct jobs and 
up to 90,000 indirect jobs.  The total estimated investment 
for the four factories is $1.8bn. 
 
6. (C) While the Afghan government representatives had 
several technical issues of concern, the only truly 
contentious issue was Fidelity,s request for market 
exclusivity for its product.  Fidelity maintained that, since 
it would essentially develop the entire infrastructure for 
the cement industry in Afghanistan, it would be unfair to 
allow others to come in later and take advantage of all of 
Fidelity,s preparatory work and significant investment. 
Also, Fidelity was concerned over the continued Pakistani 
practice of predatory cement dumping on the Afghan market and 
its negative effect on its expected market share.  In 
response to Afghan concerns over monopoly, Fidelity insisted 
that it would maintain a fair market price for their cement. 
Fidelity added that the commercial viability of the project 
would be eroded substantially without such a provision. 
 
7. (C) After making the changes requested by the Afghan side, 
including revised exclusivity terms, Fidelity presented their 
&conveyance agreement8 and investment license for approval 
to the High Commission for Investment.  On April 26, the High 
Commission for Investment called in Fidelity, joined by the 
Econ/Commoff, for a review of its license application.  The 
High Commission was composed of the Minister of Commerce, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Reconstruction, 
the Acting Minister of Mines and Industry, the Minister of 
Justice, and the Deputy Minister of Planning.  After 
extensive discussion with the Fidelity parties over the terms 
of the agreement, mostly pertaining to the still-troublesome 
&monopoly8 provisions contained in the agreement, the High 
Commission convened privately and approved the investment 
license. 
 
8. (C) After informing Fidelity that their license was 
approved by the HCI, Fidelity sought clarification of the 
meaning of the license and accompanying agreement ) was it 
merely an MOU or did it constitute a binding contract?  The 
HCI responded that the license and attached agreement was 
only an MOU.  Fidelity responded that a binding agreement 
would be required to arrange necessary financing for the 
deal.  The HCI concluded that for the agreement to constitute 
a contract, given the size and impact of the deal, it would 
have to be reviewed by the &Coordination Council8 ) a 
senior body chaired by President Karzai, which apparently 
served as an economic version of the National Security 
Council.  For this to be possible, the HCI requested that 
Fidelity have the agreement translated into Dari for 
presentation and review by the Ministry of Justice and the 
Ministry of Mines and Industry the following day.  Justice 
wanted to make certain that the appropriate Dari terms were 
used in the agreement, and Mines and Industries wanted to 
confirm that the &technical terms8 were clear. 
 
9. (C) On April 27, the Coordination Council deliberated over 
the Fidelity agreement.  Vice President Amin Arsala served as 
President Karzai,s representative for the meeting.  The 
Coordination Council raised additional concerns, including: 
needing additional bona fides for the Fidelity principals; 
clarifying language defining TISA responsibilities to support 
the project ) which could be interpreted as creating a 
sovereign guarantee; specifying raw materials involved; 
providing a more specific definition of what the 15% Afghan 
government share entailed; resolving outstanding loans due to 
the former Czechoslovakia on the Pol-e Khomri factories ($20m 
and $40m); overcoming lingering concerns about monopoly 
terms; and establishing performance benchmarks. 
 
10. (C) The Coordination Council created a task force to 
prepare the Afghan governments rejoinder to Fidelity,s 
proposed terms within 10 days.  The task force was led by 
Minister of Reconstruction Farhang and included the Ministers 
of Light Industries, Urban Development, and Mines & 
Industries Ministers.  The Fidelity principles, Mr. Hall and 
Mr. Ritter left Kabul the day after the Coordination Council 
meeting frustrated by their perception that the Afghan 
government kept reopening previously negotiated terms.  They 
were reluctant to continue negotiations for much longer. 
 
11. (C) Daoud Yaqoub of the National Security Council 
contacted Econ/Commoff on 4/28 to discuss the status of the 
Fidelity deal.  Daoud met briefly with Econ/Commoff and then 
accompanied him to a meeting with Minister Farhang.  Farhang 
emphasized that the deal was still alive, and that the TISA 
only wanted to ensure that it was fair to Afghanistan. 
Farhang noted that he felt 90-95 percent sure that there 
would be a positive result within 10 days.  Farhang wrote to 
Mr. Tompie Hall on May 4 thanking him for Fidelity,s visit 
and explaining the task force,s efforts to resolve 
outstanding issues.  Farhang concluded by saying: Begin 
quote: I would like to stress that the government of 
Afghanistan views your proposal favorably and wishes to see 
implementation as soon as possible and we look forward to 
resolving the few remaining issues so that this urgently 
needed work can commence.  End quote. 
 
12. (C) Meanwhile, the German advisor to the TISA on trade 
and investment issues, Dr. Stephen Kinneman, returned to 
Kabul from Germany and reviewed the agreement.  Kinneman,s 
conclusion was that the deal was not sufficiently fair to the 
Afghan side.  In a May 5 meeting with Ambassador, Kinneman 
spelled out his concerns over the deal as presently 
structured.  While Kinneman acknowledged that such a sizable 
investment would greatly benefit Afghanistan and that under 
current conditions Afghanistan would have to offer premium 
terms to attract capital, the agreement was nonetheless too 
slanted towards Fidelity.  His chief concern was the creation 
of a &quasi-monopoly8 for NACC.  Kinneman was also 
concerned that the agreement lacked performance benchmarks, 
offered no guarantees regarding job creation, and placed 
undue burdens on the Afghan government.  Ambassador agreed 
that foreign investment was absolutely essential to 
rebuilding Afghanistan.  This was the only way to introduce 
Afghanistan to modern open economic practices and overcome 
command economy mindsets.  While the deal may not be fairly 
balanced, it was, however, more likely the Afghan 
government,s lack of experience and expertise in negotiating 
terms was more to blame for the imbalance than any 
overreaching by Fidelity.  Econ/Commoff added that 
international businesses could hardly be expected to 
negotiate against themselves to make their terms more 
attractive for Afghanistan. 
 
13. (C) What Kinnemann suggested was for the Afghan 
government to employ legal counsel with sufficient expertise 
to gain more balanced terms for Afghanistan ) not only for 
the Fidelity deal, but for all such investment deals. 
Kinneman suggested this would be possible through pro-bono 
work by interested attorneys.  Kinneman confirmed to 
Ambassador that he was not opposed to the project as a German 
who was looking for German firms to enter the market ) he 
simply wanted the deal to be fair for Afghanistan. 
Econ/Commoff noted that Afghanistan could not expect 50/50 
balance in terms ) otherwise investors could seek such 
returns in much more secure markets.  Kinneman agreed, noting 
that something closer to 70/30 would be preferable.  If the 
current deal could be portrayed as unreasonably slanted in 
favor of Fidelity, Ambassador concluded that private advice 
might help Afghanistan remedy this imbalance. 
 
14. (C) Concerns about Fidelity,s bona fides are rumored to 
have arisen during TISA discussions of the deal, although 
internal Embassy background checks uncovered no derogatory 
information.  Econ/Commoff has asked Fidelity,s in-country 
representatives to secure additional biographic and 
background materials on both Fidelity officials and investors 
involved in raising the substantial capital the deal purports 
to deliver.  Fidelity has asked that the Department 
discretely relay the information regarding their investors to 
the Embassy for the Ambassador,s information.  On May 2, 
Fidelity forwarded additional biographic materials (C.V.s and 
company information) to Embassy, which were passed to 
Fidelity, who provided them to the Ministry of 
Reconstruction.  The reason bona fides have taken such 
prominence in this case is that Fidelity is a new company 
created to pursue this project and other similar 
reconstruction-related projects in the region.  As such, 
company history is lacking.  Therefore, the Afghan government 
will place substantially more weight on the bona fides of 
Fidelity officials and investors. 
 
15. (C) Action Request: Embassy requests that Department 
forward any such information received from Fidelity through 
secure media to Ambassador and/or Econ/Commoff for 
appropriate use. 
 
16. (C) Comment: The Task Force,s response was due on May 7. 
 Post will provide status updates at appropriate intervals.

SUBJECT: Second update on USG support for the 
Justice Commission 
 
REF:  Kabul 639 
 
1.  Summary: The Commission for Reform of Justice 
and the Judiciary (CRJJ) continues to make 
strides in implementing elements of its Master 
Plan, which includes 29 reform tasks and a rough 
budget and timeline.  The entire Plan has not 
been officially approved, which impedes needed 
upgrades in donor coordination and commitments. 
Nonetheless, the Commission?s selection and 
initial implementation of priority actions should 
elicit optimism over the possibility of reform 
occurring in the justice sector.  The USG has 
been the primary donor, to date; though, the 
Italians are designated to be the lead 
coordinating country.  Through USAID, STATE/INL 
and CJCMOTF, the USG will continue to support the 
Commission and will help the CRJJ initiate four 
out of the five high priority activities that it 
has selected from its Master Plan.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
Establishment of the Work Plan 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  USAID, through contracts with Bearing Point 
and Management Systems International (MSI) and a 
subcontract with the Asia Foundation (TAF), has 
been providing assistance to the Judicial 
Commission, since its inception.  Technical 
assistance helped the Commission for Reform of 
Justice and the Judiciary (CRJJ) establish a 
Master Plan and initialize the implementation of 
elements of the Plan.  The Plan comports with 
both mandates from the Bonn Accords and 
Presidential Decree #153 that direct the CRJJ to 
operate in the following four areas:  1) Law 
Reform; 2) Surveys, Physical Infrastructure, and 
Training; 3) Legal Education and Awareness; 4) 
Structure of Judicial Institutions. 
 
---------------------------------- 
CRJJ Progress with USG Assistance 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  The USG, through OTI and CJCMOTF, has 
assisted the CRJJ with extensive reconstruction 
of the judicial infrastructure and equipment. 
 For example, OTI funded the Kabul Public Court 
House.  Currently, the USG is also contributing 
to four of the five priority areas of the Work 
Plan selected by the CRJJ for immediate 
implementation.  For each priority area, the CRJJ 
will establish a working group.  The CRJJ has 
already selected appropriate lead and cooperating 
Ministries, as well as participating legal 
entities, organizations and actors.  USAID will 
provide technical advisors for four of these 
priority areas to help facilitate cooperation 
among the working group, budget development and 
other organizational needs.  USAID advisors will 
also provide substantive technical advice that 
includes methods for research and implementation 
of the reforms.  It remain  unclear how 
successful this cooperation will be between 
entities, particularly among other Ministries 
that may resist elements of the reform tasks. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Summary of the four USG support areas 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.   Advisor to the Chairman of the CRJJ:  The 
CRJJ faces many challenges and multiple tasks. 
It is charged with rebuilding the domestic 
justice system, which includes assessing the 
current state of the system, researching and 
proposing reforms and, in cooperation with UNAMA 
and the Italians, enlisting and coordinating the 
necessary technical and donor support.   USAID, 
through the TAF and MSI, will provide a technical 
advisor to support the CRJJ?s efforts in law 
reform and compilation, to organize a process for 
public input into decision for reform, to revise 
laws and to analyze need for reform the court 
systems.  The advisor will also provide 
administration support to the Commission and 
design approaches to training. 
 
5.   Property Deed Rehabilitation:  Property deed 
rehabilitation is considered an urgent issue to 
secure mortgages in urban areas and title for 
collateral in rural areas.  The Ministry of 
Finance is charged with the issue and may provide 
some funding from the ARTF.  USAID will manage 
the process by providing technical assistance on 
deed registry systems with the aim of proposing 
appropriate reforms.   The technical advisor will 
work with a CRJJ working group to make decisions 
about the appropriate technology, draft proposed 
amendments on the law for recording deed and 
other laws related to land tenure.  USAID will 
also provide infrastructural support for the 
rehabilitation of the property deed registry at 
the Kabul court, attempt to preserve property 
deeds and modernize the property deed recording 
office.   This work will build upon current 
USAID/OTI-funded emergency assistance in 
preserving the property deeds presently found in 
two locations. 
 
6. Prototype Legal Facility for the district 
level:  The physical infrastructure of courts is 
a fundamental componento thelong-term plan for 
judicial rehabilitation. The CRJJ plans to have 
designed a government complex which would 
encompass the district court facilities.  The 
Ministry of Urban Development will coordinate the 
design process.  STATE/INL will fund the 
construction, contributing $200,000 to $250,000. 
With USAID support, MSI will hire an architect to 
develop an optimal design for a district 
courthouse that would accommodate all appropriate 
functions for such a facility.  The legal 
facility is designed to become a demonstration 
model and develop information regarding the costs 
of such a facility.  The building will include 
space for the public to watch the proceedings, 
for staff to work and possibly reside, a law 
library with public access, detention facilities 
for criminal suspects, legal aid and a bar 
association.  The prototype will also include an 
incinerator for narcotics, a place for evidence 
storage and a center for prosecutorial training. 
Currently, CJCMOTF is considering assisting in 
the construction of district level legal 
facilities.  This design will provide a good base 
model for that construction. 
 
7.  Public Education Advisor:   Public awareness 
of the formal law in Afghanistan is minimal. 
Legal literacy is needed to inform the public, 
strengthening democracy and enhance access to 
justice.  USAID is expected to provide at least 
one technical advisor to CRJJ to assist the 
public education process around reforms in the 
justice sector.  The technical advisor will also 
work with the CRJJ to coordinate with the 
Constitutional Commission on publicity related to 
the new constitution after its adoption.  The 
public education program may include legal 
seminars, workshops and round-tables for the 
public; radio programs on legal rights and 
advertisements in the print media. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Possible future USG assistance to the CRJJ 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8. Planning for support for the CRJJ has 
proceeded in two additional areas.  INL, through 
TAF, plans to provide support for a one-year 
program in prosecutorial training.  Training 
prosecutors would inaugurate CRJJ plans to 
require training and examinations and pay scales 
for the justice sector and tie personnel for 
promotion and increases in salary to an 
examination process.   A second area currently 
under planning is USAID?s supported reform in 
public administration.  Following the 
ratification of the Constitution, the 
organization of the state and building 
transparency and accountability into this 
organization will be a pressing priority. 
However, the law reform demanded by reform in 
public administration is a politically sensitive 
area, which involves reform that reaches beyond 
the specter of judicial and criminal reform. 
Consequently, public administration is burdened 
with political uncertainty and apprehension that 
hinders the pace and the uniformity of its 
implementation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
CRJJ assistance from other government donors 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
9. The Italians have adopted the lead on 
performing a survey on the institutional status 
of the Justice Sector across Afghanistan, as well 
as an evaluation of the existing informal 
systems.  Initial development of this survey was 
executed by USAID-funded technical assistance 
through the TAF, in cooperation with CJCMOTF. 
The survey of Kabul is complete and USAID has 
been informed by the Italians that the survey 
process has begun in 5 other regions.  It is 
unclear when the Italians will complete the 
project. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Concerns on progress of the Justice Commission 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
10. Three issues related to the work of the CRJJ 
should be monitored.  First, the CRJJ needs to 
officially approve the Master Plan and release 
it, in order to elicit greater donor commitments. 
 Second, it is important to note that many of the 
first approved projects focus more on the form of 
the system and less on the substance of law 
reform.  The political sensitivity around 
extensive law reform often slows or stalls its 
implementation in transitioning countries. 
Third, coordination between the Constitutional 
Commission and the Judicial Commission appears to 
be strained, as indicated by the Constitutional 
Commission?s unwillingness to share a copy of the 
draft Constitution with the Justice Commission. 
Problems in coordination will hinder the ability 
of the Justice Commission to do some of the work 
mandated by Bonn, such as the creation of a draft 
law on the constitutional curt and the law on 
justice administration.

SUBJECT: UPDATE ON KABUL-KANDAHAR ROAD: AMBASSADOR\'S MAY 7 
MEETING WITH ARC VP LANE 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) On May 7, Ambassador met with the Afghan 
Reconstruction Company,s Vice President, Tim Lane, and 
Managing Director, Zaher Yaqoubi.  Lane presented the 
Ambassador with a summary of progress on the Kabul-Kandahar 
road and shared concerns over the end-of-2003 completion 
deadline. 
 
2. (C) Lane acknowledged ARC could have performed better to 
date.  He pointed out, however, that ARC started operations 
with no infrastructure in place and significant demining 
required.  ARC had to import and build up all production 
facilities and faced considerable delays in importation and 
transportation of relevant equipment.  Right now, operations 
were proceeding very quickly.  Lane noted that the most 
visible work ) blacktopping ) was done last and 
comparatively took very little time. 
 
3. (C) Lane noted three factors of concern.  First, the 
material amounts detailed in Louis Berger,s bid document 
were not sufficient to complete the project ) partially due 
to the following two factors.  Second, after conducting 
survey work, ARC determined that heavily overloaded truck 
traffic traditional to Afghan transport would necessitate 
much thicker layers than originally planned.  Third, the 
Afghan government had mandated that the road, including 
shoulders, be 12 meters wide, rather than the originally 
planned 10.5 meters.  Lane acknowledged that the second 
factor could be alleviated if weight restrictions could be 
enforced on the road, but felt this was unrealistic in the 
near term.  Addressing these factors, while maintaining 
world-class road building standards, would cost an estimated 
additional $8.5 million. 
 
4. (C) Lane said ARC was determined to build a world-class 
road as they had agreed and the USG had promised.  The 
Ambassador noted that completion of the road was a foreign 
policy priority of the USG in Afghanistan.  Indeed, it held 
the personal attention of President Bush.  No one would 
benefit if the road fell apart in a few years.  Lane agreed, 
noting that ARC also had a reputation to maintain.  Lane 
added another factor that would require possible changes to 
ARC,s original plans ) the issue of frost depth.  After 
study, ARC had determined that ensuring longevity of the road 
required modification of the original plan to account for 
frost depth. 
 
5. (C) Lane detailed an often-troubled relationship between 
ARC and Louis Berger.  Lane noted Berger was defensive 
regarding reasons it had not included the Afghan 
government,s requirement of 12-meter width in the original 
agreement.  Lane also detailed intense disagreements over 
minor accounting discrepancies.  Finally, Lane shared his 
concern that Berger or USAID would think that ARC was trying 
to &scam8 them by raising their concerns over anticipated 
additional costs for completion of the project.  The key 
issue, Lane asserted, was that if Berger and/or USAID 
&pushed back8 against these additional requirements, the 
result would be a diminution in quality of the finished road. 
 (USAID Comment: USAID has heard many complaints from TISA 
officials about the &high8 costs associated with this road. 
 ARC,s comments will likely generate more criticism.  End 
comment.) 
 
6. (C) Lane also noted that security issues were perhaps not 
being fully reported by Berger.  According to Lane and 
Yaqoubi, on Saturday, April 3, an armed group forced ARC,s 
workers to cease working.  According to Yaqoubi, the workers 
involved were all Afghan, and the gunmen reportedly asked 
them &When will the Turkish workers be here.8  ARC reported 
the incident to Louis Berger, and has taken steps to enhance 
security along the road project.  At the May 8 Emergency 
Action Council meeting, both RSO and USAID confirmed they had 
not received any report about the incident.  ARC has agreed 
to pass their security incident report to the Embassy.  USAID 
subsequently raised this issue with Louis Berger. 
7. (C) Lane told Ambassador that ARC would soon be fully 
active, with blacktop scheduled to be laid beginning in July 
at 1-2 km a day.   He was confident that ARC would complete 
the project on schedule.  It was unfortunate, however, that 
just when ARC had its operations going at full speed, it 
would be completing its contracted project.  ARC had not bid 
on future segments of the road, Lane said, because they 
wanted to complete their existing obligation to standard and 
they were assured that the entire road would be built to this 
same standard.  Now it appeared that this standard would be 
diluted on the remaining portions of the road to meet a 
December 31, 2003 deadline.  Given this situation, Lane 
maintained that ARC could complete additional portions of 
road at substantially lower cost per km ($100,000 less) than 
their own project had required, and vastly less than the 
accelerated plans for completion of the remainder of the road 
entailed.  For this reason, Lane asked if arrangements could 
be made to maneuver upcoming tender allocations of the road 
so that ARC could push on with its now-efficient work on the 
section adjoining their current project. 
 
8. (C) Finally, Lane noted that ARC was preparing to test the 
output of their asphalt plant through a demonstration in 
Kabul sometime in June, and suggested the road from the 
airport to the Presidential palace might be appropriate.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MAY 2 MEETING WITH AGRICULTURE 
MINISTER ANWARI 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. FINN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Ambassador met with Afghan Minister of Agriculture and 
Livestock Sayed Hussain Anwari on May 2.  Anwari requested 
the Ambassador,s intervention on eight areas of need for the 
Ministry.  First, the Minister requested help in establishing 
an Institute for Livestock Research.  Second, the Minister 
requested help arresting the spread of epidemic livestock 
diseases ) including a severe outbreak of hoof and mouth 
disease - in the North.  Third, the Minister requested 
donation of an extensive list of relevant vaccines and 
equipment for both research and treatment of livestock 
disease.  Fourth, the Minister requested audiovisual 
equipment to improve the media reach of the Ministry.  Fifth, 
the Minister requested support to obtain internet capability 
and computerization of the Ministry.  Sixth, the Minister 
requested technical support by U.S. agricultural experts and 
advisors.  Seventh, the Minister requested help in rebuilding 
a farmer,s cooperative building that he said was destroyed 
during OEF bombing.  Finally, the Minister requested help in 
obtaining international market access for Afghan agricultural 
goods. 
 
2.  (C) The Ambassador responded that he would follow up with 
USAID on the status of the Research Institute proposal and 
steps to address the outbreak of livestock disease in the 
North.  Ambassador further noted that USDA is very interested 
in increasing their involvement in Afghanistan, and that 
President Karzai had a productive meeting with Secretary of 
Agriculture Veneman during Karzai,s February visit to 
Washington.  The exact nature of USDA and USG engagement in 
the agricultural sector was being finalized and would be 
determined soon.  One proposal under review was to post 
agricultural experts to selected PRTs.  As for the provision 
of vaccines, the Ambassador asked if any other countries had 
the necessary vaccines.  Minister Anwari replied that the 
vaccines were available through Iran and India.  Ambassador 
suggested that the Minister discuss the possibility of India 
offering the vaccines as part of its Tokyo assistance pledge 
of $100m.  Ambassador reaffirmed that US support for 
Afghanistan would continue despite Iraq, and that the US 
Congress had recently authorized an additional $100m for 
Afghanistan is a special supplemental and $820m in support 
was planned in the FY2004 budget.

SUBJECT: PROPOSAL TO WORK WITH ECONOMIC COOPERATION 
ORGANIZATION TO CONVENE  REGIONAL TRADE INITIATIVE 
PREPARATORY MEETING 
 
Classified By: CDA Bradford Hanson for reasons 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (SBU) The USG and the World Bank are planning to hold the 
ministerial-level Regional Trade Initiative Conference on the 
margins of the IMF/WB Annual Meetings in Dubai from September 
21-23, 2003. 
 
2. (C) The interagency community is considering a proper 
venue to conduct a preliminary planning meeting on the 
Regional Trade Initiative in the June/July timeframe.  Post 
proposes that the USG consider  working with an existing 
regional body, the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), 
to convene this meeting.  The ECO is already scheduled to 
hold a Trade and Investment meeting in 2003, but according to 
their website, www.ecosecretariat.org, the exact date and 
location have not been fixed.  If the interagency and World 
Bank agree, we could proceed with a meeting in coordination 
with ECO that will serve both purposes. 
 
3. (C) The ECO,s membership includes Afghanistan,s 
neighbors --  Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan -- along with regional countries 
with a high interest in regional trade and investment regimes 
like Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  For the 
purposes of the regional trade initiative, observer nations 
might include the U.S., India, China, an E.U. representative 
and Russia. 
 
4. (C) Post defers to Washington,s judgment to determine the 
feasibility of including Iran in such a conference (Iran is a 
founding member of ECO ) which was founded in the 1970s by 
Turkey, Iran and Pakistan).  There is, however, a strong case 
to be made that any regional trade initiative intended to 
enhance, legalize and regularize regional trade and 
investment flows must by definition include Iran.  The 
alternative is to give Iran (and its proxies in Afghanistan)

SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL BANKING SECTOR UPDATE - JUNE 2003 
 
1. (SBU) In previous reporting, post has identified the lack 
of commercial banking facilities in Afghanistan as a major 
obstacle to attracting increased investment.  Further, the 
lack of reliable banking institutions, and the resulting 
prevalence of NGOs and businesses having to keep large 
amounts of cash on hand has also increased crime rates. 
While the principal impediment to attracting foreign 
commercial banks ) the passage of the commercial banking law 
and the central banking law ) are still unresolved, some 
positive developments are expected soon. 
 
2. (SBU) The Ministry of Finance has been trying ) without 
success - for at least the past eight months to attract two 
foreign banks.  The Ministry of Commerce secured a visit from 
officials of Britain,s Standard Chartered during a visit to 
London in the spring of 2003.  Standard Chartered is now 
reported to open its first branch in Afghanistan in August 
2003.  Most recently, in late May 2003, the Central Bank has 
invited eight Pakistani banks to operate throughout 
Afghanistan. 
 
3. (SBU) During the past week, U.S. entrepreneur Jack Heidary 
visited Kabul to discuss opening a $25-$50m OPIC-financed 
commercial bank.  Heidary met with Afghan government 
officials including Minister of Finance Ghani, Minister of 
Commerce Kazimi, Central Bank Governor Ahady, and Embassy and 
U.S. military representatives to assess the viability of a 
commercial bank.  Heidary,s due diligence visit will inform 
a report to OPIC officials regarding the mix of services, 
locations and clientele for this project.  Among the services 
contemplated are US Dollar and Afghan afghani direct deposit 
accounts for the Afghan civil service, NGO, and international 
military and diplomatic community officials.  Heidary 
suggested bank branches may be based in Kabul and other major 
cities at first, and also explored the possibility of 
providing ATM services.

Classified By: Ambassador Robert P. Finn for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C) Post hosted June 19 a meeting with the visiting NATO 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) delegation led 
by Deputy Secretary General for Peacekeeping Robert Serry. 
Representatives from NATO embassies in Kabul included the UK, 
Spanish, Turks, Danes, and Dutch; the Germans, Belgians and 
French also have embassies in Kabul but did not attend the 
meeting.  Discussion focused on security in and around Kabul, 
necessary preparations for NATO,s assumption of ISAF 
command, lead nation responsibility for Kabul International 
Airport, and potential Russian assistance to ISAF.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
SECURITY AND SUGGESTIONS FOR NATO ISAF 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The delegation expressed pleasant surprise regarding 
the efficiency of the Afghan MFA and Embassy in Brussels, 
which transmitted a NATO paper to Kabul, circulated it 
amongst other Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan 
(TISA) ministries, collected comments, and generated 
constructive feedback. 
 
3. (C) Deputy Secretary General Serry and his staff inquired 
about security in Kabul and throughout the country, 
developments surrounding the October Constitutional Loya 
Jirga (CLJ), the summer 2004 elections, and security sector 
reforms including disarmament, demobilization, and 
reintegration (DDR) and restructuring the Ministry of 
Defense.  The discussion touched only briefly on Provincial 
Reconstruction Teams (PRT), as the delegation intended to 
address the issue separately in a subsequent meeting with 
Office of Military Cooperation Chief MG Karl Eikenberry. 
 
4. (C) Offering the Embassy Kabul perspective on important 
steps in NATO,s assumption of ISAF command, CDA and Poloffs 
stressed the need to immediately establish contact with key 
TISA ministries, especially the Ministry of Interior, UNAMA, 
and counterparts in CJTF-180.  Embassy officers underscored 
the need to start planning for security in the Kabul area of 
responsibility in advance of the selection of CLJ delegates 
and the actual convening of the CLJ in October.  Another 
significant point is the imperative of establishing a robust 
public relations/psychological operations program that 
targets Kabul,s population.  Emboffs suggested that it was 
not too late to start planning with relevant TISA officials 
for the Hajj; such planning should start at least three 
months beforehand, i.e. in September.  ISAF,s major role is 
cooperation at the Kabul airport, which funneled almost half 
of last year,s 26,000 Hajjis, with particular focus on 
security around the airport and passenger assembly point in 
liaison with the Ministry of Interior. 
 
5. (C) CDA and Poloffs also emphasized that NATO should 
consider the role of ISAF in the DDR process when it arrives 
in Kabul.  Furthermore, ISAF,s part in demilitarizing Kabul 
(i.e. removing Afghan Militia Forces in the capital, most of 
whom are Panjshiris loyal to Defense Minister Fahim) in 
accordance with the Bonn Agreement should be carefully 
thought out and strategized as TISA authorities and the 
international community muster the political will and a 
practical plan to carry out demilitarization. 
 
------------------------------ 
LEAD NATION FOR KABUL AIRPORT 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Responding to a query on a lead nation for Kabul,s 
international airport, Serry stated that the Germans were 
ready to continue as lead nation provided there was common 
funding.  (Comment:  Since taking over the APOD (aerial point 
of departure - the military side of the combined 
civilian/military Kabul International Airport) from the 
Turks, the Germans have done a superb job; they have invested 
much in repairing bombed out buildings, paving a new heliport 
area, expanding the apron, marshalling more fire and safety 
equipment, and installing many new prefabs for offices, 
barracks, and storehouses.  Embassy recommends the Germans, 
with whom the Embassy has an excellent working relationship, 
remain in charge of the airport.  End comment.) 
 
-------------------------------------- 
RUSSIAN ASSISTANCE OFFER TO NATO ISAF 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) On the question of Russian interest in assisting NATO 
ISAF, Serry conveyed that the Alliance,s Military Committee 
was studying the Russian offer, though NATO members were 
divided in opinion.  Serry explained that Russian transit and 
overflight permissions would be useful, but that no Russian 
soldiers would be stationed with ISAF.  Intelligence sharing 
via Tajikistan and possible Russian military airlift are also 
part of the offer, Serry said.  He also mentioned that 
Secretary General Lord Robertson had phoned Karzai about the 
 
SIPDIS 
Russian offer of assistance and Karzai stated it was a very 
sensitive subject that would have to be considered carefully. 
 (Comment:  Karzai, perhaps, in his first phone call with 
Robertson, was too polite to tell him outright, NOT a good 
idea.  End comment.) 
 
8. (C) Embassy officers held that Russian involvement in ISAF 
is politically infeasible at this time for the Karzai 
administration.  With memories still fresh of the calamity 
inflicted on Afghanistan by the Soviets, most Afghans would 
not understand observable Russian participation in ISAF. 
Were they to become visibly involved, ISAF might face an 
additional security threat with irate Afghans targeting ISAF 
because of the Russian (Soviet) connection.  Also, the 
Taliban, al-Qa\'ida, and Hezb-e Islami (Hekmatyar) would try 
to score public relations points against the Karzai 
government and Coalition for including the Russians. 
 
9. (C) Deputy Secretary General Serry informed the group that 
President Karzai invited SG Robertson to Kabul on September 
26, if Karzai himself is not attending the UN General 
Assembly at that time.  He also conveyed that NATO invited 
Foreign Minister Abdullah and SRSG Brahimi to North Atlantic 
Council meetings on July 16 and 23, respectively.  Finally, 
Serry offered that SG Robertson would not come to the August 
12 ISAF change of command ceremony, which NATO wants to keep 
low-key. 
10. (U) Dushanbe minimize considered.

SUBJECT: NORTHERN VIEWS ON AFGHANISTAN,S FUTURE 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ZALMAY KHALILZAD FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  VII Corps General Wasiq met with the 
Ambassador on May 10 to discuss major initiatives to bring 
stability and promote economic and political progress in 
northern Afghanistan.  Key topics included: northern 
disappointment with the perceived slow pace of reconstruction 
efforts in the north; VII Corps objections to Phase II of the 
Disarmament, Demilitarization and Reintegration (DDR) 
program; and reports of covert Iranian funding of Shia 
elements in the Mazar-e-Sharif area.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) General Wasiq, one of Tajik Jamiat leader Usted 
Atta,s top field officers, noted the northern perception 
that there did not appear to be adequate international 
assistance allocated to northern Afghanistan.  The Ambassador 
outlined several major USG initiatives under way in northern 
Afghanistan, such as programs to build and revamp schools and 
clinics and irrigation projects. Wasiq added that 
construction of a new Balkh University campus had just begun. 
 The Ambassador expressed interest in hearing more about 
progress on the university. 
 
3. (C) Wasiq outlined VII Corps objections to including its 
1st and 26th Divisions in Phase I DDR.  He claimed that 
General Dostum deserved 95 per cent of the blame for recent 
hostilities.  Wasiq said that if VII Corps gives up its 
weapons, Atta and his followers might as well pack up and 
leave Mazar-e-Sharif.  The Ambassador replied that it was not 
feasible for Dostum to attack.  Any such action would not be 
ignored and would not be tolerated. 
 
4.(C) Wasiq reiterated Atta,s position that Phase II DDR is 
not fair.  Wasiq remarked that he thought Minister of Defense 
Fahim had not paid a lot of attention to this matter.  The 
Ambassador noted that Atta appears to have a DDR agenda that 
he has coordinated with Fahim Khan.  The Ambassador stated 
that DDR is the top priority and that if Phase I DDR is not 
completed on time, it could delay the national elections. 
 
5. (C) Wasiq also noted that Mohaqeq,s return to the 
national government would benefit the government, but would 
have a negative impact on his political support.  Wasiq 
suggested that this would undercut Mohaqeq,s strategy of 
presenting himself as sticking to his principles in support 
of his people,s interests. 
 
6. (C) Wasiq then said he had reliable information that 
Iranian agents had been covertly funding Shia groups in the 
Mazar-e-Sharif area.  This assistance reportedly including 
the provision of some arms.  The Ambassador indicated we take 
such matters seriously and would look into it. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) This was a useful discussion that covered Jamiat views 
on urgent issues that dominate political debate in northern 
Afghanistan. It provided an opportunity to spotlight 
significant U.S. initiatives in the region. 
 
8. (C) The allegations about Iranian agents, activities in 
the Mazar-e-Sharif warrant further examination. Iran has a 
history of involvement in the region; local suspicions were 
rekindled when Iran reopened its consulate general in 
Mazar-e-Sharif earlier this year.  End Comment.
