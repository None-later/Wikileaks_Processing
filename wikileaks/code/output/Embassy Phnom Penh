SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
2.  SOLOMON, PIAK, AND GRIFFITHS THANKED SDC SNC MEMBER HOR 
NAMHONG FOR SOC COOPERATION OF THE POW/MIA ISSUE.  SOLOMON 
STRESSED TO HOR NAMHONG THE NEED FOR ALL THE FACTIONS TO ABIDE 
BY THE COMMITMENTS IN THE PARIS AGREEMENT TO ENSURE THE KHMER 
ROUGE HAD NO EXCUSES FOR NOT COOPERATING THEMSELVES.  SOLOMON 
EMPHASIZED THAT POLITICAL RIGHTS MUST BE RESPECTED AND THERE 
MUST BE AN END TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  SIV REINFORCES THIS 
POINT, UNDERLINING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS EXTEND BEYOND POLITICAL 
PRISONERS ISSUES TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION, FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, 
AND FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION, AMONG OTHERS.  HOR NAMHONG LISTED 
SOC CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION AND PLEDGING FULL COOPERATION 
BY THE SOC.  HOWEVER, HE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT HUMAN RIGHTS 
COULD BE \"OVER-USED,\" RESULTING IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  WHILE 
SOLOMON PRESSED FOR 100 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION OF FACTIONAL 
FORCES, HOR NAMHONG SUGGESTED REVISITING THE QUESTION AFTER 10 
PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  A/S SOLOMON HELD A ONE-HOUR MEETING WITH SOC SNC MEMBER AND 
FOREIGN MINISTER HOR NAMHONG MARCH 9 IN PHNOM PENH.  DR. 
SOLOMON\'S DELEGATION INCLUDED COM TWINING, WHITE SHOUSE SPECIAL 
ASSISTANT SICHAN SIV, DOD DAS ALAN PTAK, NATIONAL LEAGUE OF 
FAMILIES PRESIDENT ANNE MILLS GRIFFTHS, EAP/VLC DIRECTOR CHRIS 
LA FLEUR, AND OTHERS. 
 
4.  HOR NAMHONG THANKED DR. SOLOMON FOR THE VISIT AND 
ESPECIALLY FOR THE LIFTING OF THE U.S. EMBARGO AGAINST 
CAMBODIA.  RECALLING THE MEETING HE HAD HELD WITH DAS QUINN IN 
WASHINGTON, HE PROMISED THAT THE SOC WOULD CONTINUE FULL 
COOPERATION ON THE POW/MIA ISSUE, WHICH HE SAID THE SOC SEES AS 
A PURELY HUMANITARIAN QUESTION. 
 
GOC CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF ACCORD 
------ ------------ --------------- ------- 
 
5.  HOR NAMHONG PLEDGED FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARIS PEACE 
AGREEMENT BY THE SOC.  HE THEN ENUMERATED SOC CONCERNS.  FIRST, 
HE SAID THE 70 PERSENT DEMOBILIZATION OF FACTIONAL FORCES MUST 
BE CARRIED OUT BEFORE THE RAINY SEASON BOGS DOWN TRANSPORTATION 
IN THE COUNTRY.  SECOND, HE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT SOMETHING BE 
DONE TO FIND WORK FOR THE DEMOBILIZED SOLDIRES.  IF THEY WERE 
LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES, THEY MIGHT BECOME INVOLVED IN 
\"MISCONDUCT.\"  THIRD, ON REPATRIATION, HOR NAMHONG CITED THE 
INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF DEMINED LAND FOR THE RETURNEES.  HE 
WORRIED THAT DELAY OF THE RETURN OF PEOPLE FROM THE BORDER 
COULD PROLONG THE TRANSITION PERIOD, WITH BAD CONSEQUENCES FOR 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACCORD.  FOURTH, THE SOC SNC MEMBER 
CITED POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH CORRUPTION AND VOTE BUYING IN THE 
ELECTIONS. 
 
\"MUST NOT SEE AND OVER-USE OF HUMAN RIGHTS\" 
-------- --------------- ---------- ------- 
 
6.  FIFTH, HOR NAMHONG ASSERTED THAT, WHILE ALL SIDES HAD 
COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO IMPLEMENTING PLURALISM AND LIBERAL 
DEMOCRACY AND FREEING ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS AT THE JANUARY 14 
SNC MEETING, ONLY THE SOC HAD DONE SO.  HOR NAMHONG WORRIED 
THAT, \"FREEDOMS WILL BE EXPLOITED FOR POLITICAL REASONS.... WE 
MUST NOT SEE AN OVER-USE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.\" 
 
7.  THE SOC SNC MEMBER ALSO SAID IT REMAINED UNCLEAR THAT THE 
KR WILL VOLUNTARILY ABIDE BY THE ACCORDS.  HE POINTED TO THE 
SHOOTING OF THE UN HELICOPTER AND CEASEFIRE VIOLATIONS IN 
KOMPONG THOM AS EVIDENCE THE KR MAY NOT COOPERATE.  FURTHER, 
HOR NAMHONG SPECULATED THE KR MIGHT NOT RESPECT THE RESULTS OF 
FUTURE ELECTIONS.  HE ARGUED, \"FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
ACCORD WILL NOT MEAN THE END OF THE KR THREAT.\"  HE AVERRED 
THAT KR STRATEGY IS NOT TO WIN ELECTIONS NOW, BUT TO STRENGTHEN 
THEIR POSITION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY FOR THE FUTURE. 
 
U.S. GRATITUDE ON POW.MIA ISSUE 
------------- ----------------- 
 
8.  A/S SOLOMON, RESPONDED BY THANKING HOR NAMHONG ESPECIALLY 
FOR THE COOPERATION THE U.S. HAS RECEIVED ON POW/MIA.  DAS PTAK 
AND MRS. GRIFFITHS ALSO EXPRESED GRATITUDE FOR SUPPORT ON 
POW/MIA, ESPECIALL PERMITTING THE USE OF HELICOPTERS IN 
CAMBODIA.  DR. SOLOMON CITED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S SPEECH IN JANUARY 
IN SINGAPORE AND THE COMMITMENT OF PRESIDENT BUSH TO MOVE 
TOWARD NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH ALL THE NATIONS OF INDOCHINA 
AS PROGRESS IS MADE ON POW/MIA.  THE MEETINGS IN HANOI, WITH 
THE AGREEMENT ON THE FIVE-POINT PLAN, IF IMPLEMENTED SINCERELY, 
WILL ADVANCE U.S. NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRIES 
OF INDOCHINA.  THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH LIFED THE U.S. 
EMBARGO ON CAMBODIA IS A SIGN OF U.S. SINCERITY, AS IS THE U.S. 
INTENTION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARIS 
PEACE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FUNDING WHICH MAY REACH AS MUCH AS 
USD 600 MILLION FOR THE U.S. 
 
NEED FOR 100 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION, RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
---------- --------- ------------ ----------- ------- ------ 
 
9.  DR. SOLOMON STRONGLY PRESSED FOR 100 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION 
OF FACTIONAL FORCES.  THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE GREATEST SECURITY 
FOR CAMBODIA SINCE THE REMANANTS OF THE FACTIONS\' ARMIES COULD 
RETURN TO FIGHTING.  PRINCE SIHANOUK AGREES WITH THIS APPROACH, 
HE SAID.  ON HUMAN RIGHTS, DR. SOLOMON STRESSED THAT, FOR 
CAMBODIA TO OVERCOME THE BURDEN OF ITS TRAGIC PAST, IT WOULD BE 
HARD TO OVER-EMPHASIZE HUMAN RIGHTS.  HE TOOK EXCEPTION WITH 
THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S CONCERN THAT HUMAN RIGHTS MIGHT SOMEHOW 
BE \"OVERDONE.\"  HE STRESSED THAT THE UN WOULD HAVE THE 
AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN CAMBODIA EVEN 
AFTER UNTAC HAD LEFT.  THIS WOULD BE IMPORTANT. 
 
CONCERN OVER KR NON-COOPERATION, MUST NOT GIVE KR EXCUSES 
------ ----------- ------------- ----------- ------------ 
 
10.  DR. SOLOMON SAID THE U.S. CONSIDERS THE RESISTANCE OF THE 
KR TO COOPERATE WITH THE PEACE AGREEMENT A MATTER OF SERIOUS 
CONCERN.  THE KR HAVE SOUGHT ALL MEANS TO KEEP THE UN OUT OF 
ITS ZONE.  THE KR COMPLAINS THAT THE VIETNAMESE ARE STILL 
PRESENT AND THAT, THEREFORE, THEY MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT.  THE 
U.S. CANNOT JUDGE WHETHER SOME VIETNAMESE TROOPS REMAIN IN 
CAMBODIA, SOLOMON SAID.  IT IS UP TO UNTAC TO VERIFY THE 
WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN FORCES.  SOLOMON CONCLUDED THAT THE POINT 
IS THAT, \"ALL OTHER FACTIONS MUST ABIDE BY THE PEACE PLAN SO 
THE KR HAS NO EXCUSES FOR NON-COOPERATION.\"  THIS WOULD 
STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S HAND IN BRINGING 
PRESSURE ON THE KR.  THE SOC SHOULD FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE 
RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS.  THIS WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON 
THE KR, WHO HAVE THUS FAR RELEASED NONE.  THE SOC AND OTHER 
FACTIONS SHOULD ALSO COOPERATE COMPLETELY WITH UNAMIC/UNTAC AND 
SHULD REFRAIN FROM ANY MILITARY OPEATION OR MOVEMENTS WHICH 
VIOLATE THE SPIRIT OF THE AGREEMENT.  THE FACTIONS MUST PROVIDE 
FULL ACCESS FOR THE UN TO THEIR ZONES. 
 
11.  SOLOMON SAID THAT THE QUESTION OF POLITICAL PLUARLISM IS 
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE IN 
DEALING WITH THE KR.  THE U.S. IS DEEPLY DISTURBED BY POLITICAL 
VIOLENCE IN CAMBODIA, ESPECIALLY THE ASSASSINATION OF TEA BUN 
LONG, THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF OPPOSITION FIGURE DUNG 
PHAN, AND THE ATTACK ON KHIEU SAMPHAN.  THE ANGER OF PEOPLE AND 
DESIRE FOR REVENGE AGAINST THE KR IS UNDERSTANDABLE.  HE 
REMINDED HOR NAMHONG OF SECRETARY BAKER\'S STATEMENT IN PARIS 
THAT THE U.S. WOULD FAVOR EFFORTS TO BRING THOSE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE GENOCIDAL POLICIES OF POL POT TO JUSTICE. 
NEVERTHELESS, ALL PARTIES MUST CREATE A SECURE ENVIRONMENT OR 
THERE WOULD BE UNENDING VIOLENCE,  DR. SOLOMON SAID THE U.S. IS 
AWARE THAT SOME IN THE SOC REGIME ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT NEW 
POLITICAL PARTIES BEING FOUNDED.  BUT POLITICAL OPENNESS IS 
ESSENTIAL TO FIGHTING THE KR.  MOREOVER, IN THE U.S. THERE ARE 
MANY PEOPLE BORN IN CAMBODIA WHO WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE 
TOWARD CAMBODIA\'S DEVELOPMENT.  THEY MUST FEEL SECURE OR THEY 
WILL NOT BE WILLING TO RETURN AND PARTICIPATE. 
 
 
FACTIONS MUST SHOW SETTLEMENT WORKING TO MAINTAIN U.S. SUPPORT 
--------- ----------- ------------ -------------- ------------ 
 
12.  A/S SOLOMON WARNED THAT IF THE UN SETTLEMENT IS NOT SEEN 
TO BE WORKING, SOME IN THE U.S. SHOULD PAY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS FOR THE PEACE PLAN.  WHEN SOC PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN 
TRAVELS TO WASHINGTON, HE WILL FACE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FULL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACCORDS. 
 
13.  HOR NAMHONG RESPONDED TO A.S SOLOMON\'S POINTS BY SAYING WE 
MUST NOW WORK TO ACHIEVE 70 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION FIRST AND 
PLEDGED THAT THE SOC WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL IT HAD RELEASED ALL 
POLITICAL PRISONERS.  THERE WILL BE ANOTHER RELEASE ON MARCH 
23-24 OF PRISONERS FROM ODDAR MEANCHEY PROVINCE.  WHEN THE 
PRINCE TRAVELS TO KOMPONG SOM, ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS HELD 
HERE WILL ALSO BE RELEASED.  FINALLY, HE PROMISED THE SOC 
AUTHORITIES WOULD INVESTIGATE THEIR OWN SYSTEM TO ENSURE THERE 
ARE NO MORE POLITICAL PRISONERS HELD.  HOR NAMHONG WENT FURTHER 
TO SAY THAT \"WE ARE INTERVENING WITH THE INTERIOR MINISTRY\' TO 
IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR ALL OTHER PRISONERS.  THE SOC HAS ASKED 
ICRC FOR HELP WITH MEDICINES AND FOOD TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS IN 
THE PRISONS. 
 
14.  THE SOC FOREIGN MINISTER PLEDGED THE SOC WOULD FULLY 
COOPERATE WITH UNAMIC AND UNTAC ON MILITARY MATTERS.  HE SAID 
THE SOC HAS NO NEED TO ENLARGE ITS ZONES AND SAID KARIM HAD 
EXPRESSED COMPLETE SATISFACTION WITH SOC COOPERATION 
MILITARILY.  THE SOC HAS FOUGHT BACK ONLY IN SELF-DEFENSE.  HE 
CONCLUDED THAT, FOR CAMBODIA, \"THERE IS NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT 
THE PARIS AGREEMENT.  WE SEE IT AS THE BEST CHOICE TO END THE 
WAR.\" 
 
HOR NAMHONG WORRIES FREEDOM WILL BE USED FOR POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
---------- ---------- ------------ ----------- -------- ------ 
 
15.  REGARDING POLITICAL VIOLENCE, HOR NAMHONG SAID THIS WAS 
WHAT HE MEANT WHEN HE SAID \"OVER-USE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.\"  HE 
SAID, \"IT IS EASY TO USE VIOLENCE AND THEN ACCUSE THE PHNOM 
PENH GOVERNMENT.\"  IT WAS OTHERS WHO PROFIT FROM THESE CRIMES, 
HE ALLEGED.  HE SAID THE VIOLENCE DOES NOT AFFECT JUST PEOPLE 
LIKE TEA RUN LONG AND DUNG PHAN.  HE SAID THERE HAD BEEN 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS AGAINSTG BOTH HIM AND HUN SEN AND THAT 
THERE HAD BEEN AN ATTACK ON HIS SON.  HOR NAMHONG CONCLUDED, 
\"WE NEED TO DIVIDE THE POLITICIANS FROM THOSE WHO WOULD USE 
FORCE.\"  WHILE THERE WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULTIES, WE MUST BE 
PATIENT, HE SAID. 
 
16.  SICHAN SIV INTERJECTED TO SUPPORT A/S SOLOMON\'S POINTS. 
HUMAN RIGHTS IS ONE OF THE AREAS FOR WHICH HE IS RESPONSIBILE 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND IS A CORNERSTONE OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY 
SIV EMPHASIZED THAT RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS GOES WELL BEYOND 
SIMPLY FREEING POLITICAL PRISONERS.  IT INCLUDES FREEDOMS OF 
PRESS, RELIGION, AND ASSOCIATION, AMONG OTHERS. 
 
17.  HOR NAMHONG RESPONDED THAT,  \"WE HAVE THE SAME 
UNDERSTANDING (OF HUMAN RIGHTS), THAT IT IS NOT JUST RELEASING 
PRISONERS.\"  HE CITED THE SIDE RANGE OF AGREEMENTS ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS AT THE JANUARY 14 MEETING IN PHNOM PENH AND THE 
PROTECTIONS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REVISED SOC CONSTITUTION. 
\"WE ASK OTHERS TO IMPLEMENT THESE RIGHTS 100 PERCENT.\" 
JOURNALIST WHO CAN TRAVEL IN THE GOC-CONTROLLED AREAS MUST ALSO 
BE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH THE OTHER ZONES, FOR INSTANCE. 
 
SOLOMON WARNS CORRUPTION COULD PLAY INTO HANDS OF KR 
-------------- -------------- ---------- ----------- 
 
18.  SOLOMON CONCLUDED BY SAYING THE U.S. HOPES THE SOC WILL 
GET CONTROL OF THE CORRUPTION.  CORRUPTION AMONG SOC OFFICIALS 
\"WILL ERECT A BARRIER AGAINST THE RETURN OF THE KR.\"  NOR 
NAMHONG EXPRESSED HIS AGREEMENT AND SAID THE SOC HAS TAKEN 
MEASURES AGAINST CORRUPTION, INCLUDING DISMISSING SOME 
MINISTERS.  HOR NAMHONG SAID HE HAD PROPOSED THAT THE MINISTERS 
BE SENTENCED PUBLICLY. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
19.  THE MEETING PROVIDED A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR GIVE AND TAKE 
ON THE ISSUES AND FOR THE U.S. TO STRESS THE NEED TO RESPECT 
THE ACCORDS TO ENSURE THE KR HAS NO EXCUSES FOR 
NON-COOPERATION.  IT IS CLEAR THE SOC IS NOW OPPOSED TO MOVING 
TO 100 PERCENT DEMOBILIZATION.  THE MOST WORRISOME COMMENT BY 
THE SOC FOREIGN MINISTER WAS HIS CONCERN THAT HUMAN RIGHTS 
WOULD BE USED AS PRETEXT FOR POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  END COMMENT. 
 
20.  A/S SOLOMON CLEARED THIS MESSAGE.

1. (C) - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY.  SOC FOREIGN MINISTER HOR 
NAMHONG TOOK ME ASIDE DURING UNTAC\'S DONORS REVIEW 
MEETING ON REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT FEBRUARY 25. 
AFTER ASKING ABOUT THE CORE GROUP MEETING ON CAMBODIA, 
HE TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO SPEAK FRANKLY ABOUT THE 
SITUATION FACING CAMBODIA, EMPHASIZING THE NEED TO FIGHT 
THE KR, EXPRESSING DOUBTS ABOUT FUNCINPEC AND THE KPNLF 
BUT SEEING COOPERATION WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE 
GOVERNMENT, EXAMINING PRINCE SIHANOUK\'S ROLE, AND 
PROMISING THAT THERE WILL BE A TRANSFER OF POWER, 
WHOEVER WINS.  HOR WAS PARTICULARLY CANDID IN WHAT HE 
HAD TO SAY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. MINISTER HOR NAMHONG\'S PRINCIPAL POINTS: 
 
-- THE KHMER ROUGE ARE THE PROBLEM AND MUST BE FOUGHT 
MILITARILY.  CPAF HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE PAILIN, BUT 
HUN SEN IS HOLDING BACK HIS ARMY.  I OBSERVED THAT ANY 
SUCH ATTACK COULD PRODUCE HOSTILE KR ACTION ELSEWHERE IN 
CAMBODIA, WHICH COULD ONLY MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE.  HE 
RESPONDED THAT, SOONER OR LATER, ONE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT, 
CLAIMING THAT IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT, SUBSEQUENT TO THE 
ELECTIONS, THE KR WILL BEGIN LAUNCHING ATTACKS. 
 
-- IF ONE DOES NOT FIGHT NOW, THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL 
HAVE TO TAKE ON THE FIGHT.  IF THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE\'S 
PARTY WINS THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTES, THERE IS NO 
QUESTION THAT YOU.WILL SEE IT TAKE OFFENSIVE ACTION.  ON 
THE OTHER HAND, IF FUNCINPEC OR THE KPNLF WINS, IT IS 
QUITE POSSIBLE THEY WILL SEEK TO BRING THE KR INTO A NEW 
GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN FIGHT.  THIS IS SOMETHING TO 
WHICH THE SOC IS UNALTERABLY OPPOSED.  PRINCE RANARIDDH 
HAD JOKED WITH HOR NAMHONG ONCE ABOUT THIS, BUT THE 
LATTER SAW SERIOUSNESS BEHIND RANARIDDH\'S JOKING. 
 
-- PRINCE SIHANOUK SEEMS TO WANT TO BRING THE KR IN, AS 
WELL, IN ORDER TO HAVE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.  I 
RESPONDED THAT WASHINGTON TAKES A DIM VIEW OF SUCH A 
MOVE.  THE KR HAVE WITHDRAWN THEMSELVES FROM THE 
PROCESS, AND IT SEEMS STRANGE TO REWARD NON-PLAYERS IN 
THIS WAY.  HOR NAMHONG SAID THAT THE BIG POWERS SUCH AS 
THE U.S. AND FRANCE SHOULD TALK TO THE PRINCE TO 
DISSUADE HIM FROM TAKING SUCH A STEP.  TO MY COMMENT 
THAT THE PRINCE WOULD HARDLY BE PLEASED BY FOREIGN 
MEDDLING AND THAT IT MAY BE BETTER FOR CAMBODIANS 
THEMSELVES TO TALK TO HIM, HOR NAMHONG SAID THE PRINCE 
WOULD INDEED BE ANGERED BY ANYTHING FOREIGNERS WOULD SAY 
ON THIS ISSUE.  HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HUN SEN HAD BEEN 
ABLE TO HAVE ANY FRANK DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRINCE ON 
THIS ISSUE, BUT THE LATTER WILL NOT LISTEN TO 
CAMBODIANS, EITHER.  INDEED, HE LISTENS TO FOREIGNERS 
MORE THAN TO CAMBODIANS.  THE PRINCE HAS NEVER BEEN 
WILLING TO LISTEN TO ANYONE SINCE HE WAS BORN; THIS IS 
THE PROBLEM TODAY AND IT WILL BE A CONTINUING PROBLEM. 
 
-- THE PRINCE IS PLAYING THE GAME NOW OF CLAIMING THAT 
HE IS THE ONLY PERSON CAPABLE OF SAVING THE CAMBODIAN 
SITUATION.  HE TRIED THIS IN BOTH 1970 AND 1975, AND IT 
DID NOT WORK.  ONE FEARS THAT THE SITUATION MAY BE MORE 
SERIOUS THAN HE CAN HANDLE.  NOT ONE MAN BUT ONLY 
CAMBODIANS WORKING TOGETHER WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH 
THE POST-ELECTION CHALLENGES. 
 
-- THE SOC, FUNCINPEC, AND KPNLF CAN WORK TOGETHER IN A 
FUTURE GOVERNMENT.  DISPUTES THAT EXIST AMONG THEM ARE 
OF A PERSONAL NATURE, E.G., HUN SEN VS. SON SANN, 
RANARIDDH VS. CHAKRAPONG.  THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY 
SERIOUS TO PREVENT THE KIND OF COOPERATION THAT WILL 
ENABLE THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO WORK. 
 
-- RESPONDING TO MY CONCERN THAT THE SOC, WHILE IT WILL 
UNDOUBTEDLY OBTAIN A DECENT NUMBER OF VOTES IN THE 
UPCOMING ELECTION, MAY NEVERTHELESS REFUSE TO TURN OVER 
THE REAL LEVERS OF POWER TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT, HOR 
NAMHONG AFFIRMED THAT POWER WILL BE TURNED OVER, 
WHATEVER THE RESULTS.  THE SOC SPOKESMAN HAS STATED THIS 
PUBLICLY, AND IT WILL HAPPEN. 
 
-- IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR ME TO MEET AGAIN WITH HUN SEN 
TO REVIEW THE SITUATION WHEN HE RETURNS FROM HIS 
INTERNAL TRAVELS (I.E., TELLING LOCAL OFFICIALS THEY ARE 
NOT TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE.) 
AFTER HIS CURRENT VISIT TO KAMPOT, HE WILL BE BACK IN 
PHNOM PENH LATER NEXT WEEK. 
 
4. COMMENT.  HOR NAMHONG IS CLEARLY WORRIED ABOUT THE 
POST-ELECTIONS SITUATION.  HE HAD NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT 
HIS CLAIM THAT THE KR WILL THEN MOVE TO OPEN WARFARE. 
WE SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HIS STATEMENT THAT 
FUNCINPEC AND THE KPNLF WILL SEEK TO BRING THE KR INTO A 
NEW GOVERNMENT IS VALID.  THEY HAVE BOTH INDICATED TO US 
THAT THEY WILL WANT TO DO WHAT THEY CAN TO GET THE KR TO 
COOPERATE, BUT THIS IS NOT THE SAME THING.  ON THE OTHER 
HAND, HOR WAS REASSURING REGARDING PROSPECTS FOR 
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SOC, FUNCINPEC, AND THE KPNLF IN 
A NEW GOVERNMENT, A VIEW WE SHARE.  WHERE HE WAS 
PARTICULARLY OUTSPOKEN WAS ABOUT PRINCE SIHANOUK, VIEWS 
THAT WOULD MAKE REAL PROBLEMS FOR HOR NAMHONG WERE THEY 
TO BECOME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE BUT ONES WHICH MANY CAMBODIAN 
INTELLECTUALS SHARE.  SIHANOUK REMAINS INDISPENSABLE TO 
THE SUCCESS OF THE PROCESS, PARTICULARLY IN ESTABLISHING 
INSTITUTIONS WHICH CAN HELP ASSURE THAT THERE IS A 
RESPONSIBLE AND RESPONSIVE CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE 
FUTURE.  NEVERTHELESS, HE HAS HIS LIMITS, AND THE 
SITUATION WILL WARRANT VERY CLOSE WATCHING.

SUBJECT:  HUN SEN\'S CURRENT VIEWS 
 
1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  PROMINENT CAMBODIAN-AMERICAN LEADER SICHAN SIV 
(PROTECT) HAD A ONE-ON-ONE SESSION DECEMBER 6 WITH 
SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN.  THE PRIME MINISTER WAS 
RELAXED AND DEMONSTRATED A GOOD GRASP OF DETAIL, 
ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE.  HIS PRINCIPAL POINTS WERE AS 
FOLLOWS. 
 
3.  RELEASE OF COUP PLOTTER SIN SEN.  THE TWO PRIME 
MINISTERS WERE SIMPLY UNABLE TO SAY NO TO THE KING\'S 
REQUEST.  IN ANY CASE, ONLY THE KING HAS THE POWER TO 
PARDON OR REDUCE SENTENCES.  ONE HOPES THAT SIN SEN WILL 
NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL THE APPEAL THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN 
FILED IS HEARD. 
 
4.  DEMOCRACY.  RESPONDING TO CONCERN THAT MOVES MAY BE 
AFOOT TO LIMIT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OR OTHER BASIC 
FREEDOMS, THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT DEMOCRACY MUST BE 
ALLOWED TO FLOURISH AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION MAINTAINED. 
 
5.  STATE OF THE CPP.  RUMORS OF A SPLIT BEGAN IN 
1985-86.  THEY WERE NOT TRUE THEN, NOR ARE THEY TRUE 
NOW.  IT WAS HE, HUN SEN, WHO HELPED DEVELOP OVER THE 
YEARS AND BRING TO THE FOREFRONT TWO PARTY LEADERS, SAR 
KHENG AND SAY CHHUM, THIS REGARDLESS OF THEIR MARRIAGES 
TO CHEA SIM\'S SISTERS. 
 
6.  MILITARY SITUATION.  IN GENERAL, IT REMAINS GOOD. 
PHNOM KULEN (ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF PREAH VIHEAR 
PROVINCE) WAS CAPTURED, SIEM REAP PROVINCE IS UNDER 
CONTROL, BATTAMBANG IS NOT SEEING TOO MUCH ACTIVITY, 
KOMPONG THOM IS QUIET, AND KAMPOT IS IN HAND.  THE 
NUMBER OF KR DEFECTORS HAS BECOME QUITE LARGE. 
 
7.  RICE.  THE SHORTFALL IS SERIOUS, ESPECIALLY IN THE 
EASTERN PROVINCES.  HE IS TRYING TO PERSUADE FARMERS TO 
PLANT DRY SEASON RICE TO MAKE UP THE DEFICIT. 
 
8.  COMMENT.  SIV ADMITTED THAT HE COULD NOT TELL HOW 
GENUINELY SUPPORTIVE HUN SEN WAS OF BASIC FREEDOMS OR 
HOW MUCH HE WAS IN AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE HIS GUEST 
FEEL GOOD.  SIV REMINDED HUN SEN THAT CAMBODIANS ABROAD 
NEED FAR MORE NEWS THAN THE GLOOM AND DOOM CARRIED IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS AND REQUESTED THAT THE RCG MAKE 
AN EFFORT TO GET THE NEWS OUT TO THEM.  HUN SEN PROMISED 
TO MAKE SURE THAT SIV AND OTHERS ARE INFORMED OF 
IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS.

SUBJECT:  VIEWS OF HOR NAMHONG, CAMBODIAN AMBASSADOR 
          TO FRANCE 
 
1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  FORMER SOC FOREIGN MINISTER AND PRESENT RCG 
AMBASSADOR TO PARIS HOR NAMHONG EXCHANGED VIEWS WITH THE 
AMBASSADOR JANUARY 11 DURING A VISIT TO PHNOM PENH. 
ALTHOUGH THEORETICALLY NEUTRAL POLITICALLY, HOR NAMHONG 
WITH HIS IMTIMATE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE 
FORMER REGIME HERE AND A WIDE RANGE OF CONTACTS HAS 
CONSIDERABLE INFORMATION AT HAND OF INTEREST.  HE BEGAN 
BY PRAISING THE EXCELLENT RELATIONS HE ENJOYS WITH 
AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN IN PARIS. 
 
3.  THE KING.  DESPITE CPP FEARS THAT THE KING WOULD 
SEEK TO GRAB POWER, HOR NAMHONG FOUND HIM DURING A 
RECENT MEETING TO BE VERY RELAXED.  SIHANOUK PRAISED THE 
GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY FOR ITS HANDLING OF THE KHMER 
ROUGE, OBSERVING THAT THEY ARE EVERYWHERE ON THE RUN. 
HE SAID THAT PEOPLE LIKE SON SANN, NHEK TIOULONG, AND 
SAUMURA TIOULONG HAVE URGED HIM TO TAKE POWER, BUT HE 
INSISTED THAT HE HAS SWORN LOYALTY TO THE CONSTITUTION 
AND HAS NO INTENTION OF CHANGING THE SITUATION.  THE 
KING SAID HE INTENDS TO BE A TRUE CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCH 
 
4.  EARLY ELECTIONS.  HOR NAMHONG SAID HE HAS BEEN 
HEARING SOME PEOPLE SPEAK IN FAVOR OF EARLY ELECTIONS. 
FOR SOME, IT WOULD BE A WAY TO OPEN THE DOOR TO NATIONAL 
RECONCILIATION WITH THE KR, SOMETHING HE FINDS 
PERSONALLY TO BE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.  SOME WITHIN 
FUNCINPEC BELIEVE AN EARLY ELECTION WOULD ENABLE THEIR 
PARTY TO BE THE SOLE PARTY IN CHARGE, A FALSE VIEW WHEN 
IT IS HARDLY CERTAIN THAT FUNCINPEC WOULD WIN. 
 
5.  THE SITUATION.  IN RESPONSE TO NAMHONG\'S QUESTION 
ABOUT THE SITUATION, THE AMBASSADOR SAID IT SEEMS 
BASICALLY ALL RIGHT.  BOTH STABILITY AND DEMOCRACY ARE 
IMPORTANT, AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S SUCCESS AGAINST THE 
DECLINING KR HAS BEEN IMPRESSIVE.  NAMHONG SAID HE IS 
PLEASED WITH THAT THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS ARE WORKING 
TOGETHER SO WELL.  AMBASSADOR TWINING POINTED OUT THAT, 
WHILE WE SUPPORT THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT AND THE 
CONSTITUTION PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THE ELECTIONS, 
STATEMENTS ALLUDING TO \"ENEMIES\" AMONG MP\'S AND OTHERS 
WHO \"OPPOSE\" THE GOVERNMENT ARE DISTURBING.  A DEMOCRACY 
ALLOWS FOR THE FREE EXPRESSION OF OPINION, INCLUDING IN 
THE PRESS AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND NEGATIVE ALLUSIONS 
TO THOSE WITH DIFFERING VIEWS IS NOT HELPFUL TO WHAT THE 
NEW CAMBODIA STANDS FOR.  HOR NAMHONG SAID HE AGREED 
FULLY.  THE PRESS NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIBLE, AND A PRESS 
LAW PROVIDING FOR CIVIL PENALTIES SHOULD BE USEFUL IN 
THIS REGARD.  AS FOR THE ASSEMBLY, DEPUTIES SHOULD BE 
FREE TO SAY WHAT THEY WISH.  AMBASSADOR TWINING 
EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THIS CAN BE EMPHASIZED. 
 
6.  THE JULY 2 COUP ATTEMPT.  HOR NAMHONG SAID THAT THE 
DEGREE OF HIGHER CPP SUPPORT REMAINS UNCLEAR.  CHEA SIM 
ASKED NAMHONG QUIETLY LATE LAST SUMMER TO REQUEST HUN 
SEN NOT TO PURSUE PENALTIES FOR THE COUP PLOTTERS, A 
MESSAGE HOR NAMHONG DID NOT DELIVER.  SIN SONG AND 
PRINCE CHAKRAPONG PROBABLY MADE THEIR COUP ATTEMPT DUE 
TO PIQUE THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN READMITTED TO THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, MORE THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON, A 
RIDICULOUS REASON TO EJECT THE NEW GOVERNMENT ACHIEVED 
AT GREAT COST TO THE WORLD COMMUNITY.  HUN SEN TOLD HIM 
THAT THAI FOREIGN MINISTER THAKSIN REQUESTED A PRIVATE 
MEETING DURING HIS DECEMBER 21 VISIT TO EXPRESS HIS 
PERSONAL APPRECIATION FOR HUN SEN\'S STATEMENT 
EXONERATING THAKSIN FROM INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP 
ATTEMPT.  HUN SEN HAD BRIEFED SIHANOUK AT GREAT LENGTH 
IN DETAIL LAST SEPTEMBER ABOUT THE COUP ATTEMPT, BUT THE 
KING\'S DESIRE TO PARDON THOSE INVOLVED SEEMS TO INDICATE 
THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE ALL THAT HUN SEN TOLD HIM.  HUN 
SEN FEELS HE CAN BE HELPFUL IN SHORING UP SUPPORT OF THE 
THAI BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR INVESTMENT IN CAMBODIA 
DURING HIS UPCOMING TRIP TO BANGKOK. 
 
7.  TAKING THE KR TO COURT.  HOR NAMHONG WAS PLEASED 
THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN THE \"GENOCIDE INVESTIGATION\" 
UNDERWAY.  OUR INFORMATION WILL BE HELPFUL WHEN A COURT 
BEGINS TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE, SOMETHING IT IS 
CAMBODIA\'S RESPONSIBILITY TO INSTIGATE.  IT IS INDEED 
NECESSARY FOR TOP KR LEADERS TO BE PERSONALLY PUT ON THE 
STAND.  FOR THAT, CAMBODIA WILL NEED TO ASK THAILAND FOR 
HELP IN ASCERTAINING THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE KR LEADERS 
SO THEY CAN BE TAKEN.  U.S. ASSISTANCE IN SUPPORTING THE 
CAMBODIAN REQUEST WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  HE HAS 
SUGGESTED TO RCAF CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF KE KIMYAN THAT 
HE PREPARE THE GROUND FOR THIS WHEN HE NEXT MEETS WITH 
THAI MILITARY LEADERS. 
 
8.  CAMBODIAN-FRENCH RELATIONS.  THE FRENCH FOREIGN 
MINISTER MADE A BIG MISTAKE IN CANCELLING HIS PROPOSED 
VISIT TO CAMBODIA LAST MONTH.  \"FRANCE CANNOT BASE ITS 
RELATIONSHIP TOWARD CAMBODIA ON THE DEATH OF ONE 
FRENCHMAN,\" I.E, IN LAST YEAR\'S HOSTAGE SITUATION.  HE 
WAS ALSO WRONG WHEN HE STATED IN VIETNAM THAT THAT 
COUNTRY IS THE FOCAL POINT FOR FRENCH POLICY TOWARD THE 
THREE COUNTRIES OF THE SUB-REGION.  REGARDING MILITARY 
RELATIONSHIPS, HOR NAMHONG SAID HE HAS URGED THE FRENCH 
TO COORDINATE THEIR AID WITH THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA.  HE 
IS ALSO PLEASED THAT THE FRENCH ARE FINALLY INVITING KE 
KIMRAN TO MAKE AN OFFICIAL VISIT IN APRIL, FOLLOWING HIS 
VISITS TO THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA. 
 
9.  ICORC.  HOR NAMHONG\'S PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT, 
FOLLOWING THE PARIS MEETING IN MARCH IN WHICH BOTH PRIME 
MINISTERS WILL BE PARTICIPATING, THERE SHOULD BE ONLY 
ONE MORE SUCH HIGH-LEVEL MEETING, HELD IN PHNOM PENH, 
AFTER WHICH ICORC SHOULD BE CONVERTED INTO A 
CONSULTATIVE GROUP.  HE INTENDS TO DISCUSS THIS WITH 
PRINCE RANARIDDH DURING A JANUARY 12 MEETING. 
 
10.  THE KR IN FRANCE.  THE KR, LED BY FORMER KR ENVOY 
TO UNESCO OK SAKUN (A FRENCH CITIZEN), ARE ACTIVE IN 
PROPAGANDIZING AMONG CAMBODIAN IN FRANCE.  WHILE THERE 
ARE NOT MANY WHO ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE KR, A MUCH GREATER 
NUMBER SYMPATHIZES WITH KR ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE 
\"ROTTEN\" GOVERNMENT, ETC.  HOR NAMHONG DESCRIBED THIS AS 
PART OF THE FRENCH AND FRENCH-CAMBODIAN WAY OF 
INTELLECTUALIZING THINGS WITHOUT TAKING ACCOUNT OF 
REALITY. 
 
11.  COMMENT.  THE DISCUSSION WAS A USEFUL ONE.  HOR 
NAMHONG WILL BE SEEING HUN SEN BEFORE HE LEAVES AND IS 
LIKELY TO REPORT TO HIM ON OUR CONVERSATION, INCLUDING 
OUR CONCERN REGARDING PEOPLE WHO TAKE A POSITION AT 
VARIANCE WITH THE RCG VIEW AS BEING AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT.  THIS CAN BE HELPFUL.

SUBJECT:  DEFENSE MINISTER GIVEN COMMAND CONTROL 
OVER ARMED FORCES 
 
1.  CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT C. PORTER, DEPUTY CHIEF 
OF MISSION, PHNOM PENH; REASON 1.5 (B). 
DECLASSIFY NOVEMBER 6, 2005. 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY.  THE RECENT APPOINTMENT OF THE 
CO-DEFENSE MINISTERS AS DEPUTY COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF 
PLACES THE MILITARY UNDER TIGHTER CIVILIAN 
CONTROL, BUT HAS DISPLEASED CHIEF OF THE GENERAL 
STAFF GEN. KY KIM YAN, WHO UNTIL NOW HAD BEEN ABLE 
TO IGNORE THE DEFENSE MINISTERS WHEN IT SUITED HIS 
PURPOSES.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER, CO-DEFENSE 
MINISTER GEN. TEA BANH, A STRONG SUPPORTER OF 
SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN, HAS BEEN TAKING AN 
INCREASINGLY ASSERTIVE ROLE VIS-A-VIS THE RCAF. 
TO FOSTER UNITY AND COUNTER ANY BAD FEELINGS, 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT CHEA SIM INVITED 
SENIOR RCAF, POLICE AND DEFENSE MINISTRY PERSONNEL 
TO A \"NATIONAL DAY\" BASH TWO WEEKS BEFORE NATIONAL 
DAY.  NONE OF OUR CONTACTS BELIEVES THAT KE KIM 
YAN WILL ACT ON HIS UNHAPPINESS; WE AGREE WITH 
THAT ASSESSMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C) SEVERAL RCAF CONTACTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT 
THEN-ACTING CHIEF OF STATE CHEA SIM RECENTLY 
APPROVED A PROPOSAL FROM THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS 
APPOINTING THE CO-MINISTERS OF DEFENSE AS DEPUTY 
COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF.  THE CHANGE, WHICH IN THEORY 
WENT INTO EFFECT ON OCTOBER 11, PROVIDES THE 
MINISTERS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO GIVE ORDERS TO 
CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF KE KIM YAN, WHO FORMERLY 
REPORTED DIRECTLY TO THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS IN 
THEIR CAPACITY AS COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF.  THE PRIME 
MINISTERS MADE THE CHANGE IN PART BECAUSE THEY 
WANTED A CIVILIAN TO BE IN COMMAND OF THE MILITARY 
WHEN THEY BOTH TRAVELED ABROAD (AS THEY RECENTLY 
DID DURING THE UNGA). 
 
4.  (C) A VARIETY OF SENIOR CIVILIAN AND MILITARY 
OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD US THAT KE KIM YAN IS UNHAPPY 
WITH THE CHANGE, IN PART BECAUSE HE DOES NOT GET 
ALONG WELL WITH CO-DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL TEA 
BANH (CPP).  MAKING MATTERS WORSE FOR KIM YAN, 
ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS, TEA BANH HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY ASSERTIVE IN DEALING WITH THE RCAF IN 
RECENT WEEKS, APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF INCREASED 
BACKING FROM SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN; 
MEANWHILE, THE FUNCINPEC CO-DEFENSE MINISTER 
GENERAL TEA CHAMRATH HAS GONE INTO REPOSE.  KE KIM 
YAN BELIEVES HE HAS BEEN PUT INTO A DIFFICULT 
POSITION BECAUSE, IN THE PAST, HE WAS ABLE TO 
STRADDLE SUCCESSFULLY THE FENCE BETWEEN THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE TWO MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES. 
 
5.  (C) WHEN CHEA SIM WAS MADE AWARE OF KE KIM 
YAN\'S UNHAPPINESS, HE DECIDED IT WAS TIME FOR A 
PARTY TO SOOTHE HARD FEELINGS AND FOSTER A SENSE 
OF UNITY.  REACHING FOR AN OCCASION TO HONOR THE 
ARMED FORCES, HE HELD A PREMATURE NATIONAL DAY 
CELEBRATION MORE THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE REAL 
EVENT AND INVITED THE TOP MILITARY, POLICE, AND 
DEFENSE MINISTRY LEADERSHIP.  OVER 200 RCAF AND 
POLICE GENERAL OFFICERS ATTENDED, INCLUDING KE KIM 
YAN AND THE CO-MINISTERS OF DEFENSE AND INTERIOR. 
IN HIS SPEECH, CHEA SIM REVIEWED PROGRESS TO DATE 
IN UNIFYING AND RESTRUCTURING THE ARMED FORCES AND 
POLICE AND URGED BOTH THE MILITARY AND POLICE TO 
CONTINUE THEIR COOPERATION. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE MOVE IS A WELCOME CHANGE 
BECAUSE IT PUTS THE MILITARY UNDER GREATER 
CIVILIAN CONTROL AND WILL HELP IMPROVE 
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE RCAF GENERAL STAFF AND 
THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WHICH SOMETIMES HAS BEEN 
LACKING.  NO ONE WITH WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN BELIEVES 
THAT KE KIM YAN WILL ACT ON HIS UNHAPPINESS IN A 
WAY WHICH WOULD BE POLITICALLY OR OTHERWISE 
DESTABILIZING.  WHAT IT MAY DO, HOWEVER, IS MOVE 
HIM CLOSER TO CO-INTERIOR MINISTER SAR KHENG TO 
WHOM HE HAS BEEN CLOSE PERSONALLY FOR SOME TIME. 
IT IS CURIOUS THAT, THROUGH TEA BANH, PRIME 
MINISTER HUN SEN WOULD TAKE ACTIONS WHICH WOULD 
ALIENATE THE ARMY, FROM WHICH HE HAS FREQUENTLY 
CLAIMED TO DERIVE CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT.  WE WILL 
BE COMMENTING SEPTEL ON HUN SEN\'S INCREASING 
RELIANCE ON THE MILITARY POLICE AND HIS INTEREST 
IN CREATING A SPECIAL UNIT TO ACT AS HIS 
BODYGUARDS.

SUBJECT:  FURTHER EVIDENCE OF HUN SEN\'S MENTAL 
STATE 
 
REF:  PHNOM PENH 3720 
 
1.  (S) SUMMARY.  SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN 
HAS CALLED FOR A FORMAL RCG INVESTIGATION INTO A 
REPORT, PUBLISHED BY A LOCAL NEWSPAPER, OF A PLOT 
TO ASSASSINATE HIM.  THE REPORT, SOURCED TO 
FUNCINPEC SECRETARY-GENERAL SIRIVUDH, IS MOST 
LIKELY LITTLE MORE THAN UNFOUNDED RUMOR, POSSIBLY 
FLOATED BY THE SOMETIMES MISCHIEVOUS SIRIVUDH TO 
PROVOKE A REACTION FROM HUN SEN, WHO CONTINUES TO 
SHOW A NEAR-OBSESSION WITH HIS PERSONAL SECURITY 
(REFTEL).  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) THE NOVEMBER 11 ISSUE OF \"NEW ANGKOR\" 
NEWSPAPER CONTAINED A STORY ABOUT A POSSIBLE PLOT 
BY UNNAMED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO ASSASSINATE 
SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN AS HE TRAVELED TO 
THE NEARBY HUN SEN DEVELOPMENT ZONE OR VISITED THE 
ROYAL PALACE (WHERE HIS BODYGUARDS USUALLY REMAIN 
OUTSIDE).  FUNCINPEC PARTY SECRETARY GENERAL AND 
FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER PRINCE NORODOM SIRIVUDH, 
WHO, THE ARTICLE SAID, REVEALED THE PLOT TO THE 
PAPER, SUBSEQUENTLY DENIED THAT HE KNEW ANYTHING 
ABOUT IT.  THREE DAYS LATER, HUN SEN DESCRIBED THE 
ALLEGED PLAN IN A SPEECH AT A MILITARY TRAINING 
CENTER NEAR PHNOM PENH, NOTING THAT THE ATTEMPT 
WOULD OCCUR IN APRIL, 1996.  HE DID NOT SPECULATE 
WHO WAS BEHIND THE PLOT. 
 
3.  (S) CO-INTERIOR MINISTER YOU HOCKRY TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR DURING A NOVEMBER 14 FAREWELL LUNCH 
THAT HUN SEN WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE REPORT AND 
HAD, WITH FIRST PRIME MINISTER RANARIDDH\'S 
CONSENT, REQUESTED A FORMAL RCG INVESTIGATION.  HE 
SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED THAT HOCKRY, RATHER THAN 
HIS CPP COLLEAGUE AND SOMETIMES PERCEIVED RIVAL, 
CO-INTERIOR MINISTER SAR KHENG, HEAD THE 
GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE. 
 
4.  (S) HOCKRY ALSO OBSERVED THAT EVEN BEFORE THE 
ASSASSINATION RUMOR HUN SEN HAD BEEN ACTING MORE 
CONCERNED ABOUT HIS SECURITY.  WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, 
HE TRAVELS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, HE TAKES ABOUT 60 
BODYGUARDS WITH HIM--MORE THAN ANY OTHER OFFICIAL. 
(BY WAY OF COMPARISON, HOCKRY SAID HE TAKES SIX 
PERSONS AND SAR KHENG UP TO FORTY.)  AFTER \"NEW 
ANGKOR\" PUBLISHED THE ASSASSINATION STORY, HUN SEN 
CUT SHORT HIS VISIT TO SIEM REAP AND FLEW BACK TO 
PHNOM PENH; IN A DEPARTURE FROM HIS NORMAL 
ROUTINE, HE ASKED THAT HIS HELICOPTER PICK HIM UP 
DIRECTLY FROM HIS HOTEL, ACCORDING TO HOCKRY. 
 
5.  (S) IN A POSSIBLY RELATED MATTER, FOREIGN 
MINISTER UNG HUOT ASKED THE AMBASSADOR AT A 
FAREWELL DINNER ON NOVEMBER 13 WHETHER THE USG HAD 
ANY INFORMATION ABOUT A POSSIBLE ATTEMPT TO 
OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO. 
HE CLAIMED THAT THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WAS 
\"AWARE\" OF THE INFORMATION.  THE AMBASSADOR 
INFORMED HUOT THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE REPORT. 
 
6.  (S) COMMENT:  SIRIVUDH ONCE TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT HE DELIBERATELY MADE PROVOCATIVE 
STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS IN ORDER TO ELICIT 
REACTIONS FROM PEOPLE AND THEN ASSESS WHERE THEY 
TRULY STAND ON ISSUES.  HE DENIED INFORMING THE 
LOCAL PAPER OF THE ALLEGED ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, 
BUT WE WOULD NOT PUT IT PAST HIM SINCE HE HAS DONE 
SIMILAR THINGS IN THE PAST.  IN ANY EVENT, HUN SEN 
HAS BEEN PROVOKED INTO REACTING, AND HIS REACTION 
IS IN KEEPING WITH HIS INCREASED CONCERN, SOME 
HERE CALL IT PARANOIA, ABOUT HIS PERSONAL SECURITY 
(REFTEL).  IN OUR VIEW, RUMORS SUCH AS THIS ARE 
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY HERE, AND THE STORY 
PROBABLY HAS LITTLE OR NO BASIS IN FACT.

1.  SUMMARY.  ON MAY 3, 1997, VISITING MAJOR GENERAL 
CHARLES HOLLAND, COMMANDER, SPECIAL OPERATIONS 
COMMAND PACIFIC, HAD SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH 
THE CO-MINISTERS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE AND THE DEPUTY 
CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF, LTG MEAS SOPHEA, 
REAFFIRMING THE MILITARY-TO-MILITARY RELATIONSHIP 
AND EMPHASIZING U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEUTRALITY 
AND PROFESSIONAL ROLE OF THE CAMBODIAN MILITARY IN 
THE WAKE OF RECENT POLITICAL TENSIONS.  THE CO- 
MINISTERS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE EXPRESSED THE STRONG 
DESIRE OF THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP TO KEEP THE 
MILITARY NEUTRAL, RECOUNTED THE IMPORTANCE OF U.S. 
MILITARY SUPPORT AND TRAINING AND PLEDGED TO 
CONTINUE COOPERATION ON FORCE PROTECTION ISSUES. 
LTG MEAS SOPHEA, THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE GENERAL 
STAFF, EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. MILITARY 
SUPPORT, AND NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF FORCE 
PROTECTION TO THE RCAF.  LTG MEAS SOPHEA RECOUNTED 
EFFORTS TO KEEP THE MILITARY NEUTRAL AND NOTED THAT 
THE POLITICIANS SHOULD SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES 
PEACEFULLY.  LTG MEAS SOPHEA SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH 
THE HARD-LINE KHMER ROUGE PROBLEM HAD BEEN AFFECTED 
NEGATIVELY BY POLITICAL TENSIONS, THE KHMER ROUGE 
PROBLEM WOULD END BY NEXT YEAR. 
 
--MEETING WITH CO-MINISTERS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE-- 
 
2.  ON MAY 3, 1997, MAJ GEN CHARLES HOLLAND, 
COMMANDER, SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND PACIFIC, 
ACCOMPANIED BY THE DEFENSE ATTACHE, MET WITH CO- 
MINISTERS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE ((TEA)) BANH (CPP) AND 
((TEA)) CHAMRATH (FUNCINPEC).  AFTER AN EXCHANGE OF 
GREETINGS, MAJ GEN HOLLAND RECOUNTED HIS EARLIER 
DISCUSSIONS THE PREVIOUS EVENING AT THE DATT\'S 
RESIDENCE WITH EK SEREYWATH, THE STATE SECRETARY OF 
NATIONAL DEFENSE.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND NOTED IT WAS MOST 
ENCOURAGING THAT EK SEREYWATH STATED THAT \'THE 
CONFRONTATION\' WOULD BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY.  MAJ 
GEN HOLLAND SAID HE WOULD CARRY THESE COMMENTS BACK 
TO USCINCPAC AND EMPHASIZED THAT IT WAS VERY 
IMPORTANT FOR THE CONTINUED BI-LATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
THAT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY 
AND WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE MILITARY. 
 
3.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND SAID THAT USCINCPAC INITIATIVES 
IN CAMBODIA OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS HAD BEEN 
BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH THE RCAF AND U.S. MILITARY 
PERSONNEL DEPLOYED FOR DEMINING, MEDICAL AND 
ENGINEERING TRAINING AND EXERCISES.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND 
EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE CAMBODIAN MILITARY\'S 
POSITIVE ASSISTANCE WITH FORCE PROTECTION WHICH WAS 
A CONTINUING CONCERN FOR USCINCPAC.  HE NOTED THAT 
ONE FORCE PROTECTION INCIDENT INVOLVING U.S. FORCES 
WOULD RESULT IN A SERIOUS REEVALUATION OF CONTINUED 
DEPLOYMENTS TO CAMBODIA AND URGED CONTINUED CLOSE 
COOPERATION AND ASSISTANCE ON THIS ISSUE.  HE SAID 
THAT SOCPAC AND DEPLOYED SPECIAL FORCES PERSONNEL 
FELT GOOD ABOUT THE SUPPORT AND COOPERATION WITH THE 
RCAF AND THAT SOCPAC WOULD PROVIDE AS MUCH SUPPORT 
AS POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING RCAF SKILLS AND 
PROFESSIONALISM. 
 
4.  CO-MINISTER TEA CHAMRATH EXPRESSED HIS THANKS TO 
USCINCPAC FOR THE CONTINUING ASSISTANCE, AND 
ESPECIALLY FOR THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND PROFESSIONAL 
SKILLS TRAINING COURSES IN THE UNITED STATES (UNDER 
IMET).  HE NOTED THAT THE LAST TWO YEARS OF 
ASSISTANCE IN DEMINING, HEALTH, AND ENGINEERING 
TRAINING, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE KHMER 
ROUGE DEFECTOR PROGRAM HAD BEEN OF GREAT ASSISTANCE 
TO THE GOVERNMENT AND RCAF.  REGARDING THE REMAINING 
HARD-LINE KHMER ROUGE AT ANLONG VENG, TEA CHAMRATH 
STATED THAT TA MOK AND POL POT WERE A SMALL PROBLEM 
WHICH WOULD BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY.  HE SAID THAT HE 
AND TEA BANH VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THAT USCINCPAC 
REMAINED INTERESTED AND COMMITTED TO ASSIST 
CAMBODIA, NOTING THAT THEY COULD ALWAYS USE MORE 
ASSISTANCE. 
 
5. REFERRING TO FORCE PROTECTION, BOTH CO-MINISTERS 
STATED THAT SECURITY OF U.S. PERSONNEL WAS ALSO 
THEIR CONCERN, AND THEY WERE GRATEFUL THAT THE U.S. 
PERSONNEL WERE SO WELL-DISCIPLINED AND GOOD 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.  TEA BANH 
CONCLUDED BY EXPRESSING THANKS FOR THE MEDICAL AND 
ENGINEERING SUPPORT AT THE CHAMKAR BEI EX-KHMER 
ROUGE RESETTLEMENT CENTER AT PHNOM VOAR IN KAMPOT 
PROVINCE AND SAID THE COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. 
MILITARY WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO WORK 
TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE GOOD WORKS FOR THE CAMBODIAN 
PEOPLE. 
 
 --MEETING AT THE GENERAL STAFF-- 
 
6. EARLIER ON 3 MAY LTG MEAS SOPHEA (CPP), THE 
DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF, MET MAJ GEN HOLLAND ON BEHALF 
OF LTG KE KIM YAN, THE CHIEF OF STAFF WHO WAS OUT OF 
TOWN.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND EXPRESSED GREETING FROM 
ADMIRAL PRUEHER, CINCPAC, AND EXPRESSED APPRECIATION 
FOR THE COOPERATION AND SUPPORT FROM THE RCAF DURING 
U.S. TRAINING DEPLOYMENTS AND EMPHASIZED THE 
CONCERNS ABOUT FORCE PROTECTION FOR U.S. FORCES 
TRAINING IN CAMBODIA.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND ALSO 
EXPRESSED CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PROFESSIONAL 
PRESENTATION BY THE CAMBODIAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE 
1997 PACIFIC AREA ARMIES MANAGEMENT SEMINAR IN 
HAWAII THE PREVIOUS MONTHS, NOTHING THAT MAJ GEN 
KHEM SOPHOAN\'S PRESENTATION ON THE RCAF WAS VERY 
WELL RECEIVED BY THE CONFERENCE.  RECOUNTING 
USCINCPAC/SOCPAC HUMANITARIAN DEMINING SUPPORT, MAJ 
GEN HOLLAND SAID THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM WAS AN 
IMPORTANT BENCHMARK OF THE USG\'S AND USCINCPAC\'S 
SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING THE GOVERNMENT AND THE RCAF 
AND HOPED THIS SUCCESS WOULD CONTINUE.  LTG MEAS 
SAID FORCE PROTECTION OF U.S. PERSONNEL WOULD 
CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE RCAF WHO 
ENJOYED THE BENEFITS OF U.S. MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS. 
 
6.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND NOTED THAT WHILE USCINCPAC HAD 
PROVIDED A LOT OF SUPPORT AND TRAINING TO THE RCAF, 
WASHINGTON WOULD REACT VERY NEGATIVELY TO THE RCAF\'S 
PARTICIPATION IN VIOLENCE.  LTG MEAS SOPHEA 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE RECENT POLITICAL TENSIONS AND SAID 
FORTUNATELY THAT THERE HAD ONLY BEEN FIGHTING WITH 
WORDS AND NOT WEAPONS.  HE STATED THAT POLITICAL 
TENSIONS HAD NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DRY SEASON 
OPERATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HARD-LINE KHMER 
ROUGE AT ANLONG VENG, AS WELL AS THE INVESTMENT 
CLIMATE IN CAMBODIA.  LTG MEAS STATED THAT WHILE THE 
RCAF HAD DECLARED NEUTRALITY AND HAD TAKEN STEPS 
INSURE THE TROOPS REMAIN UNDER CONTROL, IT WAS UP TO 
THE POLITICIANS TO LIMIT THEIR FIGHTS TO RADIO AND 
TELEVISION WITH NO WEAPONS.  HE ADMITTED THAT, 
UNFORTUNATELY, SOME SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS WERE 
STILL INFLUENCED STRONGLY BY THE POLITICAL 
LEADERSHIP.  HE SAID THE TWO POLITICAL PARTIES MUST 
SOLVE THE ISSUES BETWEEN PEACEFULLY NOTING THAT 
CAMBODIA WAS STILL A VERY YOUNG DEMOCRACY WITH MANY 
PROBLEMS WHICH COULD ONLY BE RESOLVED STEP BY STEP. 
 
7.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SECURITY 
SITUATION AND STATE OF THE RCAF, LTG MEAS SOPHEA 
SAID THAT SINCE AUGUST 1996, 90 PERCENT OF THE KHMER 
ROUGE HAD JOINED THE GOVERNMENT AND THERE WAS PEACE. 
AT REMAINING KHMER ROUGE ENCLAVE AT ANLONG VENG 
THERE WERE ONLY BETWEEN 1000-2000 FIGHTERS AND THAT 
THE KHMER ROUGE RANK AND FILE WANTED TO STOP 
FIGHTING.  HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT HAD HAD LITTLE 
SUCCESS IN NEGOTIATING WITH POL POT AND TA MOK, BUT 
HAD CONVINCED MANY FRONT LINE KHMER ROUGE SOLDIERS 
TO DEFECT.  HE SAID THE RCAF\'S STRATEGY WAS TO 
PROCEED STEP BY STEP, AVOID FIGHTING AND SLOWLY 
WEAKEN THE KHMER ROUGE THROUGH AN ATTRITION OF 
DEFECTORS.  HE SAID THE KHMER ROUGE WERE 
LOGISTICALLY WEAKENED AND THAT SPIRIT DE CORPS AND 
MORALE AMONG THE RANK AND FILE WAS VERY LOW. 
VILLAGES NO LONGER SUPPORTED THE KHMER ROUGE AND 
THAT THE KR HAD RESORTED TO TERROR TACTICS AGAINST 
THE POPULACE TO PREVENT DEFECTIONS.  HE SAID THAT 
THE KHMER ROUGE PROBLEM WOULD END BY NEXT YEAR. 
 
8. COMMENTS. MAJ GEN HOLLAND\'S VISIT FURTHER 
ENHANCED THE GROWING BI-LATERAL MILITARY 
RELATIONSHIP AND PROVIDED ANOTHER RECENT OPPORTUNITY 
FOR A SENIOR U.S. MILITARY OFFICER TO EXPRESS 
SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE PROPER ROLE OF THE 
MILITARY IN A DEMOCRACY.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND\'S COMMENTS 
WERE WELL-RECEIVED FROM THE CO-MINISTERS AND LTG 
MEAS SOHPEA, ALL OF WHOM UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL 
IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTING POLITICAL TENSIONS FROM 
ERUPTING INTO VIOLENCE.  MAJ GEN HOLLAND\'S VISIT 
FOLLOWS THE MID-APRIL VISIT OF MAJOR GENERAL STEPHEN 
SILVASY, THE DEPUTY COMMANDER, U.S. ARMY PACIFIC, 
WHO ALSO DELIVERED A STRONG AND CLEAR MESSAGE OF HOW 
RCAF INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE WOULD BE 
VIEWED BY THE USG.  THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MINISTRY 
OF DEFENSE AND THE GENERAL STAFF CLEARLY UNDERSTAND 
THE GREAT COSTS, BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY 
TO THEMSELVES, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO THE CONTINUED 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE RCAF AND CAMBODIA, SHOULD THE 
TENSIONS ERUPT INTO EXTRA-LEGAL VIOLENCE.  EMBASSY 
IS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF BOTH VISITS BY PACOM SENIOR 
OFFICERS, WHOSE WORDS WERE RIGHT ON TARGET WITH OUR 
TARGET AUDIENCE.

SUBJECT: CAMBODIAN FOREIGN MINISTER WINS LIBEL CASE AGAINST 
NEWSPAPER 
 
1. SUMMARY:  A RECENT DEFAMATION/LIBEL CASE AGAINST THE 
COUNTRY\'S LEADING ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER, THE CAMBODIA 
DAILY, HAS JOURNALISTS CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR 
POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE USE OF ANTI-DEFAMATION LAWS 
AND PLIANT COURTS TO INTIMIDATE JOURNALISTS AND PREVENT THEM 
FROM PUBLISHING CONTROVERSIAL STORIES.  WHILE THERE IS NO 
CLEAR PATTERN OF SUCH ABUSE OF PRESS FREEDOM, FOREIGN 
MINISTER HOR NAMHONG WON A DEFAMATION SUIT IN SEPTEMBER 
AGAINST THREE CAMBODIA DAILY JOURNALISTS WHO PUBLISHED A 
QUOTE LINKING HIM TO ATROCITIES COMMITTED DURING THE KHMER 
ROUGE REGIME. USING THE UNTAC-PERIOD CRIMINAL CODE RATHER 
THAN THE MORE RECENT PRESS LAW, THE COURT FOUND THE 
JOURNALISTS GUILTY AND ORDERED THEM TO PRINT A RETRACTION 
AND PAY TOTAL FINES OF ABOUT $7,500 TO HOR NAMHONG AND THE 
STATE.  SOME JOURNALISTS AND LEGAL OBSERVERS CHARGE THAT THE 
COURT PROCEEDINGS WERE IRREGULAR, AND BOTH SIDES HAVE 
ANNOUNCED THEY WILL APPEAL THE RULING.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. IN JANUARY 2001, AT THE TIME OF THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE 
OVER THE KHMER ROUGE TRIBUNAL LAW, THE CAMBODIA DAILY 
PUBLISHED TWO ARTICLES LINKING CAMBODIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
HOR NAMHONG TO THE KHMER ROUGE REGIME AND KILLINGS AT THE 
INFAMOUS TUOL SLENG PRISON. ACCORDING TO QUOTES ATTRIBUTED 
TO FUNCINPEC PARTY SENATOR KEO BUNTHOUK, HOR NAMHONG, AS THE 
INMATE LEADER OF THE KHMER ROUGE RE-EDUCATION CENTER AND 
PRISON AT BOEUNG TRABEK, SENT FELLOW INMATES TO THE KHMER 
ROUGE INTERROGATION CENTER AND PRISON AT TUOL SLENG, AND 
THESE FELLOW INMATES WERE NEVER SEEN AGAIN.  SENATOR KEO 
BUNTHOUK WAS ALSO A PRISONER IN BOEUNG TRABEK. HOR NAMHONG 
IS KNOWN FOR HIS SENSITIVITY ABOUT ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING 
HIS ROLE AT BOEUNG TRABEK, AND EVEN FILED A LIBEL SUIT IN 
FRANCE AGAINST KING SIHANOUK OVER A SIMILAR CHARGE PRIOR TO 
THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE MONARCHY IN CAMBODIA. 
 
3. HOR NAMHONG REPLIED THAT AS THE INMATE PRISON LEADER HE 
HAD NO POWER TO SEND OTHER PRISONERS TO TUOL SLENG. 
CLAIMING DEFAMATION AND LIBEL, HE FILED SUIT IN PHNOM PENH 
MUNICIPAL COURT AGAINST THE CAMBODIA DAILY\'S U.S. CITIZEN 
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, A U.S. CITIZEN REPORTER AND A CAMBODIAN 
REPORTER.  THE TWO U.S. CITIZENS SUBSEQUENTLY LEFT THE 
COUNTRY, FOR REASONS NOT CONNECTED TO THE LAW SUIT. 
 
4. DURING THE TRIAL IN SEPTEMBER 2001, SENATOR KEO BUNTHOUK 
TESTIFIED THAT SHE HAD NEVER MADE THE COMMENTS TO THE 
REPORTER LINKING HOR NAMHONG TO KHMER ROUGE KILLINGS.  HOR 
NAMHONG ALSO PRODUCED TWO OTHER WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED THAT 
THEY WERE AT THE BOEUNG TRABEK PRISON AND THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER HAD NO POWER TO ORDER THE KILLING OF OTHER INMATES. 
THE CAMBODIA DAILY ARGUED THAT THE INFORMATION PRINTED IN 
THE ARTICLE WAS ACCURATE AND THAT QUOTES TAKEN FROM THE 
SENATOR DURING DEBATE COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED LIBEL. 
 
5.  DURING THE TRIAL, THE JUDGE REFUSED A DEFENSE REQUEST TO 
TRY THE CASE UNDER THE PRESS LAW, RATHER THAN THE OLDER AND 
LESS APPROPRIATE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE U.N. TRANSITIONAL 
AUTHORITY IN CAMBODIA (UNTAC).  HOWEVER, THE MUNICIPAL COURT 
JUDGE ISSUED HER VERDICT BASED ON BOTH LAWS.   ON SEPTEMBER 
21, THE JUDGE RULED AGAINST THE JOURNALISTS, AND ORDERED 
THEM TO PAY $6,250 DAMAGES TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND 
$1,250 IN FINES TO THE STATE.  IN ADDITION, THE JOURNALISTS 
WERE ORDERED TO PAY TO HAVE THE VERDICT PRINTED IN THE 
CAMBODIA DAILY, RASMEI KAMPUCHEA AND KOH SANTEPHEAP 
NEWSPAPERS.  FAILURE TO PAY THE FINES AND COST OF PRINTING 
THE VERDICT WOULD RESULT IN JAIL SENTENCES. 
 
6. THE DECISION OF THE COURT WAS WIDELY CONDEMNED BY 
JOURNALISTS AND LEGAL EXPERTS, WHO QUESTIONED THE FAIRNESS 
OF THE PROCEEDINGS.  EDITORS FROM THE CAMBODIA DAILY CHARGE 
THAT THE JUDGE APPLIED THE LAW SELECTIVELY, AND THAT SHE 
REFUSED TO ADMIT RELEVANT EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE, 
SUCH AS TAPE RECORDINGS THAT WOULD ALLEGEDLY HAVE PROVED 
THAT SENATOR BUNTHOUK DID INDEED MAKE THE STATEMENT THE 
PAPER ATTRIBUTED TO HER.  THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT THE JUDGE 
WENT OUT AND OBTAINED EVIDENCE OF HER OWN, IN VIOLATION OF 
HER MANDATE.  THE LAWYER FOR HOR NAMHONG WAS ALSO 
DISSATISFIED WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AS 
THEY WERE SEEKING USD $1 MILLION.  LAWYERS FOR BOTH SIDES 
HAVE STATED THEY WILL APPEAL THE RULING, AND HAVE UNTIL 
NOVEMBER 22, 2001, TO DO SO. (NOTE: THE CAMBODIA DAILY IS 
THE COUNTRY\'S LEADING ENGLISH LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER, AND IS 
WIDELY READ BY POLITICAL AND CIVIL SOCIETY LEADERS. IT IS 
OWNED BY FORMER NEWSWEEK CORRESPONDENT AND AMERICAN CITIZEN 
BERNARD KRISHER, AND FUNCTIONS AS A NON-GOVERNMENT 
ORGANIZATION WITH THE STATED GOALS OF UPGRADING THE SKILLS 
OF LOCAL JOURNALISTS AND STRENGTHENING FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. 
THE EDITOR OF THE PAPER TOLD EMBASSY THAT THEY ARE WILLING 
TO PAY FOR AN APPEAL IN ORDER TO PUBLICIZE THE CASE AND 
PROMOTE PRESS FREEDOM.  END NOTE.) 
 
7. COMMENT: THERE IS NO CLEAR PATTERN OF ABUSE OF ANTI- 
DEFAMATION LAWS AGAINST THE PRESS IN CAMBODIA.  HOWEVER, 
JOURNALISTS ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS CASE COULD ESTABLISH A 
NEGATIVE PRECEDENT, IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OR POWERFUL 
INDIVIDUALS WILL USE FEAR OF FINANCIAL RUIN TO KEEP THE 
PRESS FROM PUBLISHING EMBARRASSING STORIES.  MANY TOP 
POLITICIANS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS 
TO BRING LAWSUITS AGAINST PUBLICATIONS, AND THE POWER TO 
INFLUENCE THE WEAK AND NOTORIOUSLY CORRUPT JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
IN THEIR FAVOR.  MOST NEWSPAPERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE 
ONLY MARGINALLY FINANCIALLY VIABLE EVEN UNDER THE BEST OF 
CIRCUMSTANCES, AND MAY FIND THEY MUST AVOID CONTROVERSIAL 
SUBJECTS OR RISK EXPENSIVE LAWSUITS THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD.

REF: STATE 146687 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR CHARLES A. RAY.  REASON: 1.5 (B) (D). 
 
1.  (C) DURING A JUNE 4 MEETING ON THE CAMBODIAN ELECTIONS 
AND COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION (SEPTEL), THE AMBASSADOR 
ASKED FOREIGN MINISTER HOR NAMHONG TO WEIGH IN WITH THE SPDC 
TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI.  OBSERVING THAT 
THE DETENTION OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE 
REPUTATION OF ASEAN AS A WHOLE, THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT 
CAMBODIA AS THE ASEAN CHAIR COULD PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN 
CONVINCING THE SPDC TO RELEASE HER. 
 
2.  (C) INDICATING THAT HE WAS AWARE OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
OUTRAGE AT THE DETENTION, HOR NAMHONG RESPONDED THAT HE HAD 
JUST GIVEN AN INTERVIEW TO NHK, THE JAPANESE TELEVISION 
NETWORK.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD RELATED TO NHK THAT ASEAN HAD 
BEEN PLEASED WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS IN BURMA OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS, INCLUDING AUNG SAN SUU KYI\'S RELEASE FROM 
HOUSE ARREST, THE DIALOGUE WITH THE SPDC AND THE FREEDOM SHE 
HAD TO MOVE AROUND THE COUNTRY.  NOW, HE SAID, ASEAN WAS \"NOT 
VERY HAPPY.\"  HOR NAMHONG SAID THAT HE COMMENTED THAT HE 
HOPED THE SITUATION WOULD SOON RETURN TO NORMAL.  THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER ADDED THAT ASEAN\'S PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERFERENCE IN 
THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF MEMBER COUNTRIES PREVENTED HIM FROM 
TAKING DIRECT ACTION WITH BURMA UNLESS INVITED.  HE NOTED TO 
THE AMBASSADOR ALSO THAT BURMA\'S ACTIONS WOULD BE A TOPIC FOR 
DISCUSSION AT THE ARF/PMC MEETINGS. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT.  WHILE NOT PERHAPS AS MUCH AS WE WANTED FROM 
HOR NAMHONG, HIS PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF UNHAPPINESS WITH THE 
SPDC\'S ACTIONS IS PROBABLY THE MOST WE COULD HOPE FOR.  THE 
ARF WILL, OF COURSE, PROVIDE A FORUM FOR CONCERNED NATIONS TO 
EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON THE SPDC.

Classified By: Ambassador Charles A. Ray.  Reason: 1.4 (b) (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  The Ambassador briefed Foreign Minister 
Hor Namhong December 1 on his recent meetings in Washington 
and California.  The Ambassador addressed concerns the 
Foreign Minister had expressed about the activities of the 
Cambodian Freedom Fighters, explaining that the case remained 
open.  He told the FM that Washington officials appreciated 
Cambodia\'s actions and cooperation in a number of areas, most 
notably counter-terrorism, but also anti-trafficking and the 
linkage of labor rights and trade.  He stressed the need for 
judicial reform and his commitment to moving the process 
forward.  On the current political situation, the Ambassador 
urged the government to continue to engage in peaceful, 
Constitutional dialogue to break the deadlock over formation 
of a new government.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) On December 1, the Ambassador met with Foreign 
Minister Hor Namhong to brief him on his recent meetings in 
the U.S. and to provide a response to the Minister\'s 
questions regarding the FBI\'s investigation into the 
activities of the Cambodian Freedom Fighters (CFF) (reftels). 
  On the CFF, the Ambassador emphasized that the 
investigation was not by any means closed and that Washington 
had convened an interagency meeting in October to discuss the 
CFF and similar cases.  He said that we would continue to 
ensure that the CFF case was not overlooked, but the Minister 
should understand that in the post 9/11 environment the 
Department of Justice and FBI had higher priorities.  Hor 
Namhong thanked the Ambassador for the prompt response, 
observing that Cambodia was an open society, that nothing 
prevented citizens from organizing a legitimate political 
party to further their political goals, and that there was no 
reason to resort to armed force. 
 
3.  (C) The Ambassador told Namhong that there were a number 
of areas in which Washington officials appreciated Cambodia\'s 
actions, most notably the RGC\'s cooperation in the war on 
terrorism.  He added that many in the U.S. Congress have 
concerns about working with the Cambodian government, but 
they recognized the areas of mutual interest and the need to 
cooperate.  We were looking for ways to enhance this 
cooperation. 
 
4.  (C) Noting that the problem of human trafficking was one 
of the President\'s highest priorities, the Ambassador told 
the Foreign Minister that several senior Department officials 
praised Cambodia\'s anti-trafficking efforts.  They similarly 
praised the RGC\'s cooperation in returning accused pedophiles 
to the U.S. for prosecution. 
 
5.  (C) The Ambassador commented that judicial reform in 
Cambodia has lagged and we believed there was a critical need 
to move judicial reform forward and to create mechanisms for 
conflict resolution so as to instill implicit trust among 
Cambodian citizens.  Influential American legislators agreed 
with this assessment, he said.  The Ambassador told the FM 
that a group of judges and legal scholars would be visiting 
from California in January and he hoped to get them involved 
in assessing the state of the legal system and judicial 
reform process.  Hor Namhong commented that Cambodia also 
needs teachers for the new School of Judges and Prosecutors. 
 
6.  (C) Washington officials also praised Cambodia\'s creation 
of linkage between labor rights and trade, the Ambassador 
added.  He pointed out that while much needed to be done, 
Cambodia could serve as a model for others in this area. 
 
7.  (C) On the current political situation, the Ambassador 
related to Hor Namhong that there was concern among some in 
Washington about the delay in forming a new government and 
potential for violence.  He urged the government to continue 
to engage in peaceful, Constitutional dialogue to resolve the 
deadlock. 
 
8.  (C) In response to the FM\'s question about the feelings 
and attitudes of the Cambodian-American communities with 
which he met in San Francisco and Long Beach, the Ambassador 
said that he found the communities to be divided on political 
issues with allegiance to the parties very strong.  However, 
the younger generation appeared to be less polarized, he 
said.  Nevertheless, the issues that most interested the 
Cambodian-Americans he met were the deportation of Cambodian 
nationals and why immigrant visas were not issued in Phnom 
Penh. 
 
9.  (C) Hor Namhong expressed concern that the vote in Taiwan 
approving the holding of a referendum on independence held 
the potential for endangering regional peace and stability. 
Lastly, he mentioned to the Ambassador that the Indonesian 
government had contacted the Cambodians regarding the details 
of our Article 98 Agreement.

SUBJECT: KING SIHANOUK ANNOUNCES \"RETIREMENT\" 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles A. Ray.  Reason: 1.4 (b) (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  In a message from Beijing, King Sihanouk 
announced October 6 his desire to retire due to his ill 
health.  His message referred to a letter from PM Hun Sen and 
Prince Ranariddh endorsing as his successor Prince Sihamoni, 
son of Sihanouk and Queen Monineath.  On October 7, he 
instructed acting Head of State Chea Sim not to refer any 
decisions to him as he was retired as of that date. 
Opposition leader Sam Rainsy told the Ambassador that Prince 
Ranariddh had made veiled threats to him in the National 
Assembly October 7, blaming him for King Sihanouk\'s actions. 
Rainsy had sent a letter to the King a day earlier requesting 
that the King not return to Cambodia as scheduled on October 
7 because the government would organize demonstrations 
against the King.  Rainsy said he was concerned about a 
\"coup\", but that he did not feel personally threatened.  The 
royalist FUNCINPEC party is taking the King\'s actions 
seriously, although a senior FUNCINPEC leader suggested that 
Ranariddh was fed up with Rainsy and was \"out to get him.\" 
Ranariddh suggested that it might be possible to get the King 
to change his mind; A CPP official agreed.  Given Sihanouk\'s 
track record over the years of threatening to leave the 
stage, but always coming back for an encore, we are somewhat 
skeptical of his determination this time.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) In a message from Beijing dated October 6, King 
Sihanouk requested that be allowed to retire.  He said that 
he was ill with a new stomach ailment and that he was 
\"physically and intellectually weak.\" His message referred to 
a September 4 letter to him from PM Hun Sen and National 
Assembly President Prince Ranariddh endorsing Prince Norodom 
Sihamoni as his successor, but noted that ultimately it is up 
to the Royal Throne Council to select a successor. In an 
October 7 message the King requested that acting Head of 
State Chea Sim not refer any decisions to him, as he was 
retired as of this date. 
 
3.  (C) On October 7, Opposition leader Sam Rainsy asked to 
see the Ambassador urgently.  Rainsy told the Ambassador that 
in the morning session of the National Assembly Ranariddh had 
made veiled threats against him, suggesting that he was 
responsible for the King\'s \"abdication\" because of his letter 
to the King.  Rainsy\'s letter the previous day asked the King 
to delay his scheduled October 7 return to Cambodia because, 
Rainsy claimed, a reliable source had informed Rainsy that 
there would be government-organized demonstrations against 
the King upon his arrival. The King subsequently delayed his 
return to Cambodia.  Rainsy claimed that Ranariddh said the 
situation could get out of control and that Ranariddh 
commented that politicians should have been careful as their 
actions could have serious consequences.  However, a senior 
FUNCINPEC official told us that he believed Rainsy had made 
up the story about demonstrations against the King on his 
arrival. 
 
4.  (C) Rainsy said he \"could not exclude the possibility of 
a coup,\" although he did not say who would carry out this 
coup, except to suggest that it could consolidate power in 
one man\'s hands.  Rainsy said that he did not feel in 
personal danger at the moment, but that the situation could 
deteriorate.  The Ambassador urged Rainsy to take steps to 
remove himself from danger if he felt threatened.  He also 
urged that all parties remain calm and peaceful.  The SRP 
issued a statement later in the day calling for calm.  PM Hun 
Sen left Phnom Penh today for Hanoi to attend the ASEM. 
 
5.  (C) Officials in the royalist FUNCINPEC party are taking 
the King\'s resignation/abdication seriously, although so far 
most of the evidence confirming that it is real ultimately 
leads back to Prince Ranariddh.  Deputy Prime Minister Lu Lay 
Sreng, an influential FUNCINPEC leader, told the Ambassador 
October 7 that he did not expect any violence, but that he 
believed both Ranariddh and Hun Sen are \"fed up\" with Sam 
Rainsy and are \"out to get him.\"  (Note: Ranariddh and Sam 
Rainsy are involved in messy counter-suits, Ranariddh\'s 
alleging libel and Rainsy\'s alleging that Ranariddh tried to 
have him killed.  Ranariddh has threatened to have Rainsy\'s 
parliamentary immunity lifted so he can be prosecuted.) 
 
6.  (C) Ranariddh suggested that it might be possible to get 
the King to reverse his decision.  He commented at the 
National Assembly that the King might change his mind in a 
day or two.  He later said parliamentarians would sign a 
petition asking the King to stay on.  The Director of the CPP 
cabinet, Thep Ngorn, commented to us that the best course of 
action would be for the two coalition parties to convince the 
King to change his mind, as he has done in the past. 
 
7.  (C) In terms of succession, if the King\'s decision holds, 
the nine-member Royal Throne Council has the Constitutional 
authority to decide the successor.  However, the procedures 
for doing so have not been adopted by the National Assembly. 
If the issue were decided by a vote, PM Hun Sen would hold 
the tie-breaking vote if he and Ranariddh disagree on who it 
should be.  By our count four of the members are loyal to Hun 
Sen and four are loyal to Ranariddh, including Ranariddh 
himself, who is a member based on his Presidency of the 
National Assembly.  Prince Sihamoni has been the King\'s 
choice for some time and Ranariddh has endorsed him, as did 
Hun Sen in the September 4 letter released by Sihanouk. 
 
8.  (C) Comment:  Given Sihanouk\'s track record of threats to 
resign, which extend back decades, we regard these most 
recent actions with some skepticism.  However, many 
Cambodians appear to be taking Sihanouk\'s statements 
seriously.  It is quite possible that a series of entreaties 
from political actors will lead Sihanouk to reconsider, or 
that he intended his messages to create an outpouring of 
support from the Cambodian people that would \"force\" him to 
stay on the throne.  It is also possible that Ranariddh has 
been using the King\'s statements as a weapon to attack Sam 
Rainsy with whom he has long-standing animosity.  We will see 
how this plays out in coming days.

SUBJECT: CAMBODIA HAS A NEW KING -- NORODOM SIHAMONI 
 
Classified By: DCM Mark C. Storella for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  On October 14, the Cambodian Throne 
Council unanimously (9-0) elected Norodom Sihamoni as the new 
King of Cambodia.  Sihamoni (51), a son of former King 
Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath, has lived for years in 
France as a dancer and Cambodian Ambassador to UNESCO.  He 
will be formally invested in a ceremony in Phnom Penh October 
29.  Sihanouk engineered the choice of Sihamoni to ensure the 
continuation of the monarchy.  PM Hun Sen supported the 
choice, perhaps because Sihamoni is apolitical and believed 
to be relatively pliable.  Sihamoni\'s half-brother, Prince 
Ranariddh, went along, probably grudgingly, but may still 
harbor desires someday to replace Sihamoni, possibly upon 
Sihanouk\'s death.  Sihanouk will now likely work behind the 
scenes to train Sihamoni and keep his hand in politics.  The 
succession went forward in a remarkably orderly and peaceful 
fashion in apparent conformity with the constitution and will 
likely contribute to stability.  Sihamoni has the bearing and 
open spirit of a King.  It is striking that the Cambodian 
people have shown little reaction to Sihanouk\'s decision to 
step down after 63 years at the center of Cambodian political 
life.  End Summary. 
 
Anatomy of an Abdication 
------------------------ 
 
2.  (C)  Former King Sihanouk has never been satisfied with 
his constitutional role as a monarch who \"reigns but does not 
rule.\"  Since reassuming the throne in 1993, Sihanouk has 
seen his power progressively eroded by powerful politicians, 
especially Hun Sen, and a more open political system. 
Sihanouk apparently took particular offense when  his son, 
Prince Ranariddh, and opposition politician Sam Rainsy walked 
away from a new power sharing formula Sihanouk had brokered 
last November.  He was further disappointed when political 
leaders refused his summons to Pyongyang this spring to 
settle the political deadlock.  Sihanouk has found himself 
uncomfortably marginalized.  At the same time, Sihanouk at 
81, has complained of increasing medical problems, and has no 
doubt focused on his legacy. 
 
3.  (C)  When Sihanouk announced his resignation October 7, 
many assumed it was another empty threat designed to provoke 
calls for him to assume a greater role.  In fact, it now 
seems that a tired Sihanouk was focused on using what cards 
he had left to ensure his own succession and the continuation 
of the monarchy.  In recent days, Sihanouk has spoken openly 
about his concerns about the strength of republic sentiment, 
which exists in all three top political parties, including 
the royalists.  Under the Cambodian constitution, a new King 
is to be elected from among members of the three royal blood 
lines by the Throne Council within seven days of the death of 
the former King.  A sitting King has no inherent 
constitutional role and there is no heir apparent.  And the 
constitution is moot on what happens of the King abdicates. 
It is now apparent that Sihanouk had worked behind the scenes 
with Hun Sen and others to permit him maximum influence in 
the selection of his own successor. 
 
Why Sihamoni? 
------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Many had long speculated that Ranariddh, Sihanouk\'s 
oldest son, would be the logical choice for King.  However, 
Sihanouk has had a rancorous relationship with Ranariddh for 
years.  Sihanouk may have worried that having such an overtly 
political son as King would put the monarchy itself in 
danger.  But, most important, Sihanouk is devoted to Queen 
Monineath, and, therefore, has long expressed support for his 
son by her, Norodom Sihamoni.  The selection of Sihamoni no 
doubt took on even greater emotional urgency for the Queen 
with the untimely death of her other son my Sihanouk, Prince 
Narindrapong, earlier this year. 
 
5.  (C)  Sihanouk needed Hun Sen\'s support to control his own 
succession because Hun Sen controls a majority of the seats 
on the nine-member Throne Council.  Hun Sen has expressed his 
support for Sihamoni, who is likely an attractive choice for 
two reasons:  first, Sihamoni is widely assumed to have no 
political experience or ambition; second, the selection of 
Sihamoni puts Ranariddh, a key competitor of Hun Sen, in a 
kind of political box, limiting Ranariddh\'s political options 
and increasing his dependence on Hun Sen. 
 
6.  (C)  At Sihanouk\'s request, the National Assembly quickly 
passed laws to permit election of a new King upon abdication 
and to permit election by a simple majority of the Throne 
Council, thus ensuring that Ranariddh -- a member of the 
Council by virtue of his position as president of the 
National Assembly -- could not block a vote on Sihamoni. 
Ranariddh has recently claimed his support for Sihamoni, to 
which Sihanouk publicly replied, \"anyone who tells you he 
does not want to be King is lying.\" 
 
What of Sihanouk\'s Future? 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Sihanouk claims he intends to live quietly in 
retirement.  But no one is counting Sihanouk out yet.  He has 
indicated his intention to live in Phnom Penh probably in the 
palace in close proximity to King Sihamoni.  Speculation is 
that Sihanouk will seek to mentor his son as King.  There are 
also rumors that Sihanouk may someday reenter the political 
fray openly, possibly by starting his own political party. 
As far fetched as that may sound now, Sihanouk abdicated the 
first time in 1955 precisely so that he could play an overtly 
political role and become prime minister. 
 
And Ranariddh...? 
----------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Ranariddh has professed support for his brother 
Sihamoni as King and voted for Sihamoni in the Throne 
Council.  Nevertheless, there is ongoing speculation in Phnom 
Penh that Ranariddh still hopes one day to ascend the throne. 
 While the selection of Sihamoni probably portends greater 
stability in Cambodia, one cannot rule out a tense period 
upon Sihanouk\'s eventual passing.  Sihamoni has been King for 
only 24 hours, and the rumor mill in Phnom Penh is already 
churning out speculation that Ranariddh may still hope to 
succeed his half-brother, possibly upon Sihamoni\'s eventual 
abdication. 
 
Implications for the U.S. 
------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  For the time being, there is no indication of any 
negative impact of Sihamoni\'s ascension on the throne.  The 
process by which Sihamoni was chosen was remarkably peaceful 
and orderly, which bodes well for stability in Cambodia.  At 
the same time, we know little of Sihamoni\'s political views. 
He has a close attachment to France and is a French citizen, 
but we are unaware of him ever expressing strong views about 
the U.S.  Since Sihanouk became King in 1941, U.S. relations 
with the palace have often been rocky or worse.  With 
Sihamoni\'s ascension as King, we have an opportunity to open 
a new chapter with the Cambodian monarchy.

Classified By: DCM Mark C. Storella for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C)  As Cambodia crowns King Norodom Sihamoni today, his 
half-brother, Norodom Ranariddh, is infuriating even 
supporters through childish and petulant behavior.  Ranariddh 
is stealing local headlines from the solemn coronation 
ceremonies through a series recent missteps: 
 
-- On October 25, Ranariddh\'s car was not permitted to enter 
the palace through the central gate, as Ranariddh sought to 
follow in behind the new King\'s motorcade.  Ranariddh was 
furious.  On October 26, Ranariddh insisted on removal of the 
senior palace police security officer for closing the gates 
in his face. 
 
-- On October 26, Ranariddh called for the ouster of senior 
palace minister Kong Som-ol, arguing that the position should 
not be held by an individual aligned with a political party, 
the CPP. 
 
-- Also on October 26, Ranariddh, who is president of the 
National Assembly, attacked Information Minister Khieu 
Ranariddh for halting live broadcasts on government TV of 
National Assembly sessions in favor of 15-minute summaries. 
Kanharith argued that viewers were not interested and that 
the only ones asking for airing of the full sessions were the 
Parliamentarians themselves. 
 
-- On October 28, Ranariddh raised eyebrows throughout the 
royal family by failing to attend a Buddhist coronation rite 
for royals. 
 
-- On October 29, Ranariddh emerged from one of the 
coronation ceremonies to face a phalanx of reporters.  He 
avoided controversy until the end when he was asked if he 
regretted that he was not King.  Ranariddh responded that he 
did not mind because, while not King, he was \"a King maker.\" 
 
2.  (C)  Over dinner October 28 with Ambassador and visiting 
U.S. ECOSOC Ambassador Sichan Siv, three leading members of 
Ranariddh\'s FUNCINPEC party all expressed disgust with the 
Prince\'s behavior.  While all three had some personal reasons 
to be angry with Ranariddh, the strength of their 
condemnations was striking.  Prince Sisowath Sirirath noted 
that Ranariddh did not even know that, under palace protocol, 
only the King, the PM and heads of state were permitted to 
use the gate from which Ranariddh had been blocked.  Sirirath 
told the story of Napoleon, who approached the gates of 
Fontainbleau in normal clothes and was barred by the guard. 
On returning in full imperial regalia, he elevated the guard 
to general of his guard for sticking to the rules.  Sirirath 
commented that that was the way a leader should act, whereas 
Ranariddh had responded with pique and fired someone who was 
simply following orders. 
 
3.  (C)  FUNCINPEC Deputy Secretary General Sina Than 
expressed frustration with Ranariddh\'s inability to keep his 
mouth shut.  Sina noted that the National Assembly and 
FUNCINPEC had spokesmen and Ranariddh should avail himself of 
their services rather than speaking every time there was an 
open microphone.  The group went on to say that Ranariddh had 
become increasingly unserious as a political leader.  They 
expressed irritation with his fawning efforts to curry favor 
with Hun Sen, noting Ranariddh\'s recent declaration that the 
police should report directly to the PM so that they would 
not be subject to political manipulation.  The FUNCINPEC 
members considered this patent nonsense.  Japanese Ambassador 
Takahashi told Ambassador that Sihanouk had expressed his own 
disgust with Ranariddh during an audience October 27. 
Sihanouk reportedly said that Ranariddh had demonstrated 
consistent bad judgment and tat Sihamoni was the better 
choice to preserve the monarchy. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment:  Ranariddh\'s poor comportment over the past 
week clearly demonstrates his pique at being passed over for 
a younger half-brother as King.  While Ranariddh has 
vociferously denied any desire to ascent the throne of late, 
former King Sihanouk has commented simply that, \"anyone who 
tells you they do not want to be King is lying.\"  Our dinner 
companions October 28 expressed grave doubt in Ranariddh\'s 
leadership ability, suggesting that, rather than raising his 
stature, he is increasingly making himself a laughing stock. 
King Sihamoni\'s reserved and respectful behavior, by 
contrast, seems quite regal indeed.

SUBJECT: CAMBODIA\'S BOHEMIAN KING - THE HONEYMOON IS NOT 
YET OVER 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles A. Ray.  Reason:  1.4 (b) 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  King Norodom Sihamoni continues to reach 
out to people across Cambodia, bringing a new sense of 
dignity to the royal house.  Though most of his forays into 
the countryside are carefully scripted, on occasion he breaks 
the bonds and makes a solid connection with the crowds.  His 
careful, well-modulated speeches, though prompted as much by 
his lack of familiarity with his native Khmer as anything, 
have been a welcome change from the high-pitched speech 
characteristic of his father and older half brother.  He has 
broken many of his father\'s traditions, most notably being 
his insistence on having Khmer rather than North Korean 
bodyguards, and having a less obvious security presence 
around him when he meets with people.  The Czech Ambassador 
describes Sihamoni as the \"Bohemian King of Cambodia,\" a man 
who speaks Czech like a native, and who thinks of Prague as 
his hometown.  Sihamoni\'s relationship with the Hun Sen-led 
government thus far has been without the tensions that 
existed during his father\'s time on the throne.  While it 
seems clear that Hun Sen wants a non-political king, it 
appears equally obvious that he is not anti-monarchy.  The 
most probable threat to the new King still seems to be the 
ambitions of his half brother, the mercurial Prince 
Ranariddh.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) King Norodom Sihamoni has kept up a punishing 
schedule of visits to various provinces in Cambodia since his 
coronation, most recently attending Les Nuits d\'Angkor in 
Siem Reap, much to the delight of the Cambodian members of 
the dance troupe.  Each week, he visits a different rural 
area of the kingdom, speaking to the people, and most 
important, listening to their concerns.  He projects an aura 
of calm that has in short order restored some of the dignity 
to the throne, according to some local observers.  Though his 
trips are well scripted, included carefully prepared 
speeches, he often breaks away from his entourage and gets 
close to the crowd.  At one such event which Ambassador 
attended, people in the crowd cried after touching his hand. 
Even some youth, who were noncommittal about the throne 
before his coronation, seem genuinely moved by his obvious 
compassion and concern. 
 
3.  (C)  Sihamoni speaks in a calm, well-modulated voice, a 
welcome relief from the high-pitched nasal tones of his 
father Norodom Sihanouk.  His slow, measured speech, an 
effective method of gaining an audience\'s attention, is also 
due to his unfamiliarity with his native Khmer.  Sihamoni has 
lived abroad for almost his entire adult life, and is far 
more comfortable in other languages.  He lived and studied in 
the former Czechoslovakia, for example, from the ages of 9 to 
22, and according to the Czech Ambassador, speaks Czech like 
a Prague native.  In fact, the Ambassador said, during his 
courtesy call Sihamoni told him he hoped the people of Prague 
were \"proud of him for what he had accomplished.\"  Jokingly, 
the Ambassador said that Sihamoni has been the Czech 
Republic\'s most significant export to Asia.  The last 
Bohemian King, from the house of Hapsburg, spoke Czech 
haltingly and preferred his native German, while the 
\"Bohemian King of Cambodia\" speaks perfect Czech, and even 
signs his name \"Sihamony.\" 
 
4.  (C)  The new king has also broken tradition in regard to 
his bodyguards.  Unlike his father who has a contingent of 
North Koreans, Sihamoni has insisted on having Khmer 
security, albeit trained by the more experienced North 
Koreans.  Prince Norodom Sirivudh, Deputy Prime Minister and 
co-Minister of the Interior, told Ambassador that on his 
first trip to the provinces, Sihamoni took several of his 
father\'s guards and people complained about their gruff 
behavior.  He then decided, Sirivudh said, to have them 
provide technical training to Cambodians and since, he has 
been surrounded by Khmer bodyguards.  At a Phnom Penh outing 
in early December, even the North Korean who is training the 
contingent was not in sight.  Sihamoni also does not have 
guards in sight during his audiences, unlike Sihanouk who has 
a North Korean with him at all times when he is in public. 
 
5.  (C)  Some international commentators have speculated that 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has had a difficult relationship 
with the former king, wants to abolish the monarchy in 
Cambodia.  Our observations since Sihamoni\'s coronation are 
that, while the Prime Minister prefers a non-political king, 
and probably would not hesitate to destroy the monarchy if it 
posed a real threat to his hold on power, he is not 
anti-monarchy.  Relations between the palace and the Council 
of Ministers appear to be proper, and in some instances even 
cordial.  One senior CPP official has described Sihamoni as a 
\"king we can work with.\"  For his part, Sihamoni has moved 
slowly but steadily to establish the throne as a voice for 
the voiceless, and as an institution that aims to help those 
most in need of help.  The most obvious threat to Sihamoni 
still seems to stem from his half brother Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, currently president of the National Assembly and 
head of the royalist FUNCINPEC party.  At a lunch with 
Ambassador on December 21, Ranaraddh reiterated that he loves 
being in politics and did not want to be king.  But even 
those closest to him don\'t really believe him, and what he 
might do, or try to do, after Sihanouk dies remains a mystery. 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT:  It is probably too early to predict the 
success or failure of the reign of King Norodom Sihamoni, but 
all the signs point toward success, and that is important in 
itself as he has assumed his position at a time when the 
Cambodian monarchy was at its nadir.  He seems to be 
emulating the much respected Thai King by being the father 
figure who stays above politics and who acts as the 
conscience of the nation and the voice of the poor.  He is 
increasingly, it seems, exploring the limits of his ability 
to act within the constitution, and making adjustments as he 
goes along.  As an example, early on he proposed holding 
national conferences as called for in the constitution, but 
Hun Sen objected.  Sihamoni dropped the idea, but has since 
been meeting with small groups and listening to their 
grievances - a sort of mini-conference.  Another win for 
Sihamoni came when Hun Sen, who initially objected to monthly 
cabinet briefings for the king, later announced publicly that 
he and his cabinet would do so on a monthly basis.  The 
ruling party needs the monarchy to help validate its own 
legitimacy, and as long as Sihamoni avoids the details of 
politics he will probably have CPP support.  If he continues 
to reach out to the people as successfully as he has this 
past few months, there could come a day if he is threatened 
by anyone (e.g., Prince Ranariddh), he would have the CPP and 
the whole country at his back.
