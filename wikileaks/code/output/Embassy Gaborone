         U.S. SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLICY 
 
1.  (U)  THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED BOTSWANA DAILY NEWS (JANUARY 8, 
1985) CARRIED A LONG VERBOSE OVERVIEW OF 1984, THE \"ORWELLIAN\" 
YEAR (\"VIOLENCE AND DISASTER, A GLEAM OF HOPE\") CREDITED TO DEREK 
INGRAM OF GEMINI NEWS SERVICE.  ONE PARAGRAPH MISREPRESENTS 
ONE FACET OF CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. 
 
2.  (U)  NINE PARAGRAPHS OF THE FULL-PATE ARTICLE DEAL WITH 
\"AFRICA\'S MOST DRAMATIC POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS\" IN SOUTHERN 
AFRICA, AND TOUCH ON SOUTH AFRICA\'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES, 
ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND THE RENEWED ATTEMPT TO 
CREATE \"A BUFFERS REGION OF SUBDUED OR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORING 
STATES,\" BLACK UNIONS AND THE VIOLENCE IN SOUTH AFRICAN TOWN- 
SHIPS, AND BISHOP DESMOND TUTU\'S CONDEMNATION OF U.S. 
SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLICY.  THE OFFENDING PARAGRAPH 
READS QUOTE THE AMERICANS ARE CLOSELY INVOLVED IN MANY OF THESE 
MOVES IN A POLICY (OF) \"CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT\" AND ANOTHER 
PLANK OF THAT POLICY IS FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO TRY TO MAKE 
NKOMATI-TYPE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER NEIGHBORS, NOTABLY BOTSWANA, 
LESOTHO, AND SWAZILAND.  THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN SWAZILAND, 
BUT THE OTHER TWO PROVED MORE STUBBORN.  BOTSWANA SAYS NO.  END QUOTE 
 
 
3.  (LOU)  DRAWING ON EXISTING GUIDANCE, EMBASSY PLANS 
TO SEND THE FOLLOWING LETTER OVER THE SIGNATURE OF THE PAO TO 
THE EDITOR OF THE BOTSWANA DAILY NEWS:  QUOTE: IN HIS \"VIOLENCE 
AND DISASTER, A GLEAM OF HOPE,\" WHICH APPEARED IN THE BOTSWANA 
DAILY NEWS OF JANUARY 8, 1985, MR. DEREK INGRAM WRITES THAT ON 
\"PLANK\" OF THE U.S. POLICY OF \"CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT\" IS 
\"FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO TRY TO MAKE NKOMATI-TYPE AGREEMENTS WITH 
OTHER NEIGHBORS, NOTABLY BOTSWANA, LESOTHO, AND SWAZILAND.\" 
THIS IS A MISSTATEMENT OF U.S. POLICY.  THE POLICY 
OF \"CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT\" INCLUDES AN EFFORT TO REDUCE 
CROSS-BORDER VIOLENCE BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS NEIGHBORS. 
IN THE CASE OF THE NKOMATI ACCORD BETWEEN MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTH 
AFRICA, WE WELCOMED THE AGREEMENT AS A TURNING POINT AWAY 
FROM THE DESTABILIZING POLITICS OF CONFRONTATION IN SOUTHERN 
AFRICA, IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH OF NEGOTIATIONS. 
FOR THOSE TWO COUNTRIES, A FORMAL POLITICAL AGREEMENT MET THE 
NEEDS OF BOTH PARTIES.  HOWEVER, AS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
STATE CHESTER CROCKER HAS SAID, \"THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS NOT 
PARTY TO ANY EFFORT TO IMPOSE A STANDARD FORMULA ON 
RELATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS NEIGHBORS.  EACH 
RELATIONSHIP IS DISTINCT AND STANDS ON ITS OWN MERITS. 
COEXISTENCE CAN TAKE MANY FORMS.  WHAT WE DO SUPPORT IS A REGIONAL 
CLIMATE OF DIALOGUE WHICH GIVES NEGOTIATON AND PEACEFUL 
CHANGE A CHANCE.\"  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS THE RIGHT 
OF EACH OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S NEIGHBORS TO MAKE ITS OWN 
DECISION ABOUT THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENTS IT WISHES TO MAKE WITH 
SOUTH AFRICA ON THE BASIS OF SOVEREIGN EQUALITY 
AND STRICT RECIPROCITY.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT BELIEVES 
THAT NO COUNTRY SHOULD BE FORCED TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT WHICH 
IT VIEWS AS CONTRARY TO ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS.  END QUOTE

SUBJECT: ANGOLANS IN SADF SEEK REFUGE IN BOTSWANA 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 4, TWO ANGOLAN MEMBERS OF THE SADF, 
WITH THEIR FAMILIES, SOUGHT REFUGEE STATUS IN BOTSWANA AND 
APPLIED FOR THE AMERICAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  AFTER MEETING WITH 
EMBOFFS, THE MEN WERE SENT TO THE LOCAL UNHCR OFFICIALS TO 
REGISTER AS REFUGEES.  PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THEIR APPLI- 
CATIONS FOR REFUGEE STATUS ARE REPORTED SEPTEL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ON JANUARY 4, TWO ANGOLAN MEMBERS OF THE SADF\'S 32ND- 
BATTALION \"BUFFALO COMPANY,\" CAME TO THE EMBASSY SEEKING REFUGEE 
STATUS AND INQUIRING ABOUT THE AMERICAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM 
(SEPTEL).  THE TWO FAMILIES TOTAL 15 PEOPLE. 
 
4.  THE MEN, JOAO FAUSTINO SALES AND LASERU NHUKWETE, CLAIMED 
THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAD FLED SOUTHERN ANGOLA IN THE 
DEBACLE OF 1976, SALES FROM SA DA BANDIERA (NOW LUBANGO) AND 
NHUKWETE FROM LUIMBALE (NEAR HUAMBO).  BOTH MEN SUPPORTED FNLA, 
SALES BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING FOOD AND GUNS FOR THE 
FNLA. 
 
5.  FROM 1976 TO 1978, THE FAMILIES REPORTEDLY LIVED IN AN 
ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP NEAR RUNDU ON THE ANGOLAN-NAMIBIAN BORDER; 
ANOTHER ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP WAS LOCATED FURTHER EAST IN THE 
CAPRIVI.  IN 1978, THE SOUTH AFRICANS GAVE THE REFUGEES TWO OPTIONS: 
THEY COULD JOIN THE SADF, OR BE RETURNED TO ANGOLA.  THE 
REFUGEE CAMPS WERE TO BE DESTROYED.  SALES AND NHUKWETE JOINED 
THE SADF AND ENDED UP AS TEACHERS FOR ANGOLAN CHILDREN OF OTHER 
RECRUITS.  SALES TAUGHT PORTUGUESE AND NHUKWETE SCIENCE.  SALES 
HELD RANK OF LANCE CORPORAL AND NHUKWETE CORPORAL. 
6.  ACCORDING TO SALES AND NHUKWETE, THE 32ND BATTALION IS 
COMPOSED COMPLETELY OF ANGOLANS, UNTIL 1978 ALL FNLA SUPPORTERS. 
SINCE THEN, A NUMBER OF UNITA SUPPORTERS AND \"APOLITICAL\" 
ANGOLANS HAVE ALSO JOINED THE 32ND.  WHILE THE ENLISTED MEN ARE 
BLACK ANGOLANS, THE OFFICERS ARE WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS, WHO ARE 
EORCED TO LEARN PORTUGESE IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE.  (SALES AND 
NHUKWETE SPOKE PASSABLE ENGLISH, BUT FELT MORE COMFORTABLE 
TALKING IN PORTUGUESE WITH THE EMBASSY\'S REFUGEE OFFICER.) 
 
7.  IN NOVEMBER 1983, THE MEN SAID THAT \"SOUTH AFRICAN 
INTELLIGENCE\" OFFICERS ENCOURAGED THE FOUNDING IN WINDHOEK OF A 
GROUP CALLED \"THE SOCIO-CULTURAL ASSOCIATION OF ANGOLANS IN 
SOUTH WEST AFRICA.\"  THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OR NATIONAL CHAIRMAN 
OF THE ORGANIZATION IS ALLEGEDLY TIMOTYO VICTOR, A UNITA 
SYMPATHIZER.  THE NEW ORGANIZATION WAS INTRODUCED TO THE 
ANGOLANS AT RUNDU BY A COL. VILJOEN (WHOSE NICKNAME IS 
\"FANAKOLO,\" THE NAME GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE USED IN SOUTH AFRICAN 
MINES, SINCE VILJOEN ALLEGEDLY WORKED IN THE MINES BEFORE JOINING 
THE SADF).  THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUNDU BRANCH IS JOAO APOLINARIO 
WHILE NHUKWERE WAS VICE-PRESIDENT AND SALES SECRETARY. 
ACCORDING TO A COPY OF THE SPEECH GIVEN BY THE COMMANDING 
OFFICER (EMBASSY HAS ENGLISH COPY WHICH WILL BE FORWARDED TO 
AF/S), THE PURPOSE OF THE REORGANIZATION IS \"TO PROMOTE 
FRIENDLY CULTURAL TIES AMONGST MEMBERS OF THE ANGOLAN COMMUNITY 
IN SWA...TO MEET FELLOW SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS OF WINDHOEK, 
TSUMEB, KATIMA MULILO, AND RUNDU AT SOCCER MATCHES AND OTHER 
SPORTS EVENTS.\"  EVERYONE WHO IS A \"TRUE ANGOLAN\" WAS EN- 
COURAGED TO JOIN THE ORGANIZATION. 
 
8.  IN NOVEMBER 1984, AN EXECUTIVE MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION 
WAS HELD IN WINDHOEK AND ATTENDED BY ALL BRANCH LEADERS AND 
A LARGE NUMBER OF SADF OFFICERS OF COLONEL RANK OR HIGHER, 
ALL BELIEVED BY THE ANGOLANS TO BE FROM SADF INTELLIGENCE.  THE 
ANGOLANS WERE TOLD THAT THE \"FIRST PHASE\" OF THE PROGRAM HAD 
BEEN COMPLETED AND THEY COULD MOVE ON TO THE \"SECOND PHASE.\"  THE MEN 
RECEIVED A LECTURE ON THE DANGERS AND THREAT OF COMMUNISM 
IN THE AREA AND WERE TOLD THAT ELECTIONS WOULD SOON TAKE PLACE 
IN NAMIBIA; THE ELECTIONS WOULD BE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE INTERNAL 
PARTIES AND SWAPO.  THE TWO MEN FELT THAT THEIR ORGANIZATION 
WAS BEING POLITICIZED AND THEY WERE BEING PREPARED TO TAKE 
PART IN AN ANTI-SWAPO CAMPAIGN IN NAMIBIA.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE 
ANGOLANS WERE TOLD THAT THE SADF WOULD LEAVE SOUTHWEST AFRICA 
AND RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA; THE ANGOLANS IN THE SADF WOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH THEM, BUT NOTHING WAS 
SAID ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THAT. 
 
9.  SALES AND NHUKWETE THEN REPORTEDLY DECIDED THAT THEY HAD A DIM 
FUTURE IN THE SADF AND DECIDED TO SEEK REFUGE IN BOTSWANA.  THEY 
OBTAINED TRAVEL DECUMENTS, TOOK OFFICIAL LEAVE FROM THE SADF, AND 
TRAVELLED THROUGH THE CAPRIVI TO KATIMA MULILO, CROSSED INTO 
ZAMBIA, AND THENCEOINTO BOTSWANA AT KAZUNGULA.  ACCORDING TO THE 
MEN, THEIR LEAVE EXPIRED ON JANUARY 7.

SUBJECT: BOTSWANA CHARGES BOPHUTHATSWANA WITH THREAT TO INVADE 
 
REF: GABORONE 461 (NOTAL) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. THE GOVERNMENT OF BOTSWANA HAS ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE 
STATING THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF BOPHUTHATSWANA HAS THREATENED TO INVADE 
BOTSWANA UNLESS IT HALTS THE PASSAGE OF ANC CADRE THROUGH BOTSWANA 
INTO ITS TERRITORY AND THAT OF SOUTH AFRICA. THE RELEASE ALSO CITES 
PIK BOTHA AS SAYING THAT BOTH GOVERNMENTS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MARCH 
INTO ANY NEIGHBORING COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY BELIEVE ANC GROUPS 
ARE PASSING INTO THEIR TERRITORY. THE RELEASE STATES THAT BOTSWANA 
DOES NOT PERMIT USE OF ITS TERRITORY FOR ATTACKS ON ITS NEIGHBORS AND 
THAT SOUTH AFRICA AND BOPHUTHATSWANA \"WITH THEIR LARGE SECURITY 
FORCES AND ARMIES\" SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO SEAL THEIR BOUNDARIES 
THAN BOTSWANA. THE RELEASE WAS APPARENTLY AIRED ON RADIO BOTSWANA THE 
EVENING OF FEBRUARY 4 AND WAS PICKED UP ON BOPHUTHATSWANA TV THE SAME 
EVENING. THE PRESS HAS REPORTED A RECENT MEETING BETWEEN FOREIGN 
MINISTER CHIEPE AND BOPHUTHATSWANA OFFICIALS, DENIED BY THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER. THE PRESS STATEMENT MAY REPRESENT GOB EFFORTS TO POSITION 
ITSELF FOR THE UPCOMING MEETING WITH SAG OFFICIALS REPORTED REFTEL. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A GOB PRESS STATEMENT RELEASED 
LATE FEBRUARY 4.  QUOTE: BOPHUTHATSWANA HAS THREATENED TO INVADE 
BOTSWANA UNLESS THAT PASSAGE OF A.N.C. CADRES INTO REPUBLIC OF SOUTH 
AFRICA AND BOPHUTHATSWANA, WHICH BOPHUTHATSWANA BELIEVES TAKES 
PLACE THROUGH BOTSWANA, STOPS. 
 
THIS WARNING HAS SINCE BEEN REPEATED BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER, THE HON. PIK BOTHA, WHO HAS STATED THAT THE REPUBLIC OF 
SOUTH AFRICA AND BOPHUTHATSWANA RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MARCH INTO ANY 
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY BELIEVE A.N.C. CADRES PASS 
INTO BOPHUTHATSWANA AND THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, WHETHER SUCH 
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY APPROVES OR KNOWS ABOUT SUCH INFILTRATION OR NOT 
BOTSWANA THEREFORE FACES THE RISK OF INVASION WHETHER OR NOT IT 
APPROVES OF THE ALLEGED A.N.C. INFILTRATION OR EVEN KNOWS ABOUT IT OR 
NOT. THE BOPHUTHATSWANA THREAT IS ALL THE MORE SURPRISING AS 
BOPHUTHATSWANA HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY COMPLAINED TO BOTSWANA ABOUT 
SECURITY MATTERS. 
 
BOTSWANA FOR ITS PART, HAS EXPLAINED, AS IT HAS ALWAYS DONE, THAT 
IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE USE OF ITS TERRITORY AS A BASE FOR ATTACKS ON 
ITS NEIGHBOURS OR ANY OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THAT MATTER. BOTSWANA HAS 
ALWAYS ARRESTED, TRIED AND IMPRISONED ANYBODY WHO WAS CAUGHT 
IMPORTING OR CARRYING OR IN POSSESSION OF WEAPONS IN BOTSWANA. 
BOTSWANA IS NO MORE GUILTY OF PERMITTING A.N.C. CADRES TO ENTER 
ITS TERRITORY THAN BOPHUTHATSWANA AND SOUTH AFRICA ARE OF PERMITTING 
THESE CADRES TO ENTER THEIR RESPECTIVE TERRITORIES. SOUTH AFRICA AND 
BOPHUTHATSWANA WITH THEIR LARGE SECURITY FORCES AND ARMIES, CAPABLE 
OF INVADING BOTSWANA, SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO SEAL THEIR BOUNDARIES 
AGAINST A.N.C. INFILTRATION WHICH BOTSWANA WITH ITS SMALL POLICE 
FORCE AND ARMY AND SEVERELY LIMITED RESOURCES IS UNABLE TO DO. OFFICE 
OF THE PRESIDENT, FEBRUARY 4, 1985. END QUOTE. 
 
3. (C) OUR COPY OF THE RELEASE INDICATES THAT THE STATEMENT WAS TO BE 
READ OVER RADIO BOTSWANA\'S ENGLISH NEWS AT 6 P.M. AND 9 P.M. FEBRUARY 
4. EMBASSY OFFICIALS DID NOT HEAR THESE BROADCASTS BUT PICKED UP A 
REPORT ON BOPHUTHATSWANA TV DURING THE SAME EVENING REPORTING ON THE 
RELEASE. IT WAS NOT AIRED ON THE 7 A.M. RADIO BOTSWANA ENGLISH NEWS 
FEBRUARY 5. 
 
4. (S-NOFORN) COMMENT. WE ARE SEEKING EARLY MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN 
MINISTRY AND OTHER OFFICIALS TO ASCERTAIN THE BACKGROUND TO THIS 
BPZARRE PRESS RELEASE. WE SUSPECT THAT IT REPRESENTS GOB EFFORTS TO 
POSITION ITSELF FOR THE SECURITY MEETING WHICH THE SAG REPORTEDLY 
HAS INSISTED UPON (REFTEL). INTERESTINGLY, THE INDEPENDENT GUARDIAN 
REPORTED ON FEBRUARY 1 THAT MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS CHIEPE MET 
SEDETLY ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO IN A GABORONE MOTEL WITH BOPHUTHATSWANA 
OFFICIALS. THE GUARDIAN SAID THAT DR. CHIEPE HAS \"EMPHATICALLY DENIED 
ANY KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A MEETING. THE GUARDIAN CONTINUED THAT 
INFORMED SOURCES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE BANTUSTAN GOVERMMENT SEEKS 
ASSURANCE FROM GABORONE THAT ANC FREEDOM FIGHTERS ARE NOT OPERATING 
FROM BOTSWANA.\" THE PRESS RELEASE ALSO FOLLOWS A SIRO REPORT OF AN 
ARMED CLASH FEBRUARY 3 ON THE FRONTIER TWO KILOMETERS NORTH OF THE 
TLOKWENG BORDER POST BETWEEN 3 ARMED ANC CADRE AND A SOUTH AFRICAN 
DEFENSE FORCE PATROL IN WHICH ONE SOUTH AFRICAN SOLDIER WAS SAID TO 
HAVE BEEN CRITICALLY WOUNDED. THE ANC GROUP REPORTEDLY FLED BACK INTO 
BOTSWANA. END COMMENT.

MEETING WITH BDF COMMANDER KHAMA 
 
REF:  STATE 73668 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  AS REQUESTED REFTEL, AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY DCM AND ODC 
CHIEF, MET WITH BDF COMMANDER IAN KHAMA MARCH 29 FOR A READOUT 
ON THE GABORONE CONFERENCE OF SADC MEMBER STATE ARMY CHIEFS OF 
STAFF.  KHAMA SAID ONLY ANGOLA, MOZAMBIQUE AND LESOTHO WERE 
UNREPRESENTED AT THE MEETING, WHICH FOCUSSED ON CONFLICT 
PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT.  SOUTH AFRICA, AN ACTIVE 
PARTICIPANT, WAS REPRESENTED BY SANDF ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF 
MEIRING.  ACCORDING TO KHAMA, THE FOLLOWING FOUR SUBJECTS WERE 
ADDRESSED: 
 
-- THE TYPE OF STRUCTURE BEST SUITED TO TRY TO PREVENT 
CONFLICTS AND TO MANAGE THEM IF THEY DO BREAK OUT; 
 
-- THE CAUSES AND PREVENTION OF COUPS; 
 
-- DISCUSSION OF THE HARARE PEACEKEEPING SUMMIT TO EXPLORE THE 
POSSIBILITY OF REGIONAL OR CONTINENT-WIDE APPROACHES TO 
PEACEKEEPING; 
 
--THE EFFECT OF REFUGEES ON STABILITY AND HOW TO REDUCE THEIR 
NEGATIVE IMPACT. 
 
STRUCTURE/ AREAS OF INTER-STATE COOPERATION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED AREAS IN WHICH THEY SHOULD ENGAGE 
IN REGULAR COOPERATION.  KHAMA CITED THE FOLLOWING AS DIRECTLY 
RELATED TO CONFLICT PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT:  OPERATIONS, 
INTELLIGENCE FOR EARLY WARNING, LOGISTICS, AVIATION, MARITIME 
ASSETS.  MEDICINE (E.G. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION ON REGIONAL 
OUTBREAKS OF DISEASE, AIDS) AND OTHER UNSPECIFIED AREAS WERE 
IDENTIFIED FOR COOPERATION EVEN OUTSIDE THE CONFLICT RESOLUTION 
CONTEXT.  THESE PROPOSED AREAS OF COOPERATION WERE ALLOCATED TO 
MEMBER STATES REPRESENTED.  EACH WILL ORGANIZE A MEETING TO 
FURTHER EXPLORE EACH RESPECTIVE TOPIC AND PREPARE 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MINISTERIAL APPROVAL AT A JUNE DEFENSE 
MINISTERS MEETING IN SOUTH AFRICA. 
 
PREVENTION OF COUPS 
------------------- 
 
4.  KHAMA SAID MANY, INCLUDING HIMSELF, \"POINTED FINGERS AT THE 
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP\" ON THIS ISSUE.  THEY FELT THAT POOR 
MANAGEMENT BY THE POLITICAL LEVEL, RESULTING IN ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS, CONTRIBUTED TO CREATING FERTILE GROUND FOR COUPS. 
KHAMA CITED UNBALANCED DEVELOPMENT, CORRUPTION, AND FAVORITISM 
ALONG TRIBAL LINES, INCLUDING IN THE ARMED FORCES, AS 
CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PROBLEM.  POOR TREATMENT OF THE MILITARY 
POSES ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS, KHAMA SAID, CITING THE FACT THAT 
JUNIOR RANKS, NOT JUST COMMANDERS ARE NOW ENGAGING IN COUPS. 
THE ARMY COMMANDERS CONCLUDED THAT THE AVOIDANCE OF COUPS COULD 
ONLY BE ADDRESSED BY POLITICAL LEADERS, NOT MILITARY MEN. 
 
REFUGEES AND STABILITY 
---------------------- 
 
5.  THIS FOURTH POINT CENTERED ON THE IMPACT OF REFUGEES ON 
STABILITY AND MEANS TO REDUCE THEIR NEGATIVE IMPACT.  AS WITH 
THE AGENDA ITEM ON COUPS, KHAMA SAID THE MEETING CONCLUDED THE 
IMPACT AND MANAGEMENT OF REFUGEES WAS A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY 
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, NOT THE ARMED FORCES.  THE DISRUPTION 
CAUSED BY REFUGEE FLOWS, AND THE PERCEPTION IN SOME COUNTRIES 
THAT BECAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL RELIEF EFFORTS, REFUGEES ACHIEVE 
A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING THAN LOCAL CITIZENS, CAUSED REAL 
PROBLEMS.  HE CITED TANZANIA AS A COUNTRY PARTICULARLY HARD HIT 
BY THIS PROBLEM. 
 
HARARE PEACEKEEPING SUMMIT 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  KHAMA TOLD AMBASSADOR THE GABORONE MEETING ACHIEVED THE 
LEAST ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC.  THERE WAS MUCH DISCUSSION, HE 
SAID, OF REGIONAL LOGISTICAL AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, BUT NO 
ANSWERS TO SUCH QUESTIONS AS : \"WHO WILL EQUIP AND FUND 
PEACEKEEPERS?\" AND \"WHO WILL BE GIVEN ACCESS TO STORES OF 
EQUIPMENT FOR PEACEKEEPING, AND WHEN?\" 
 
7.  AT THE MEETING, KHAMA REMINDED HIS COUNTERPARTS THAT IN THE 
LESOTHO CRISIS ONLY SOUTH AFRICA AND BOTSWANA HAD BEEN ABLE TO 
MOBILIZE AND TRANSPORT THEIR FORCES.  ZIMBABWE AND NAMIBIA, BY 
CONTRAST, REQUIRED TRANSPORTATION FOR THEIR TROOPS AND 
MATERIEL.  THE BDF COMMANDER STRESSED TO THE AMBASSADOR HIS 
CONVICTION -- WHICH HE ALSO CONVEYED TO THE GABORONE MEETING -- 
THAT \"ALL NATIONS MUST HAVE A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT ANY TROOPS 
THEY SEND.  THEY MUST NOT ASK JUST ONE COUNTRY (I.E. SOUTH 
AFRICA) FOR HELP.\"  ANY PEACEKEEPING ENGAGED IN BY REGIONAL 
FORCES, HE UNDERLINED, WOULD HAVE TO BE ENDORSED IF NOT 
REQUESTED BY THE UN AND/OR OAU.  THIS ENDORSEMENT WOULD OPEN 
THE WAY TO REQUESTS FOR DONOR SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION. 
 
8.  IN SOUTH AFRICA IN JUNE DEFENSE MINISTERS WILL MEET TO TRY 
TO COME UP WITH A FORMULA FOR FIRST USING MEMBER STATES\' OWN 
RESOURCES  FOR PEACEKEEPING, THEN TURNING TO THE UN FOR 
SUPPORT.  KHAMA STRESSED HIS VIEW THAT INITIATING REGIONAL 
PEACEKEEPING SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON RECEIVING DONOR SUPPORT 
FROM THE OUTSET.  INSTEAD, HE SAID, THERE MUST BE NATIONAL 
POLITICAL COMMITMENT IN EACH COUNTRY.  EACH COUNTRY\'S ARMED 
FORCES SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO COMMIT NATIONAL RESOURCES TO 
PEACEKEEPING IN ADVANCE OF REQUESTING INTERNATIONAL DONOR HELP. 
THIS, KHAMA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR, IS WHAT HE INTENDS TO \"WHISPER 
IN (HIS) MINISTER\'S EAR\" AT THE MEETING IN SOUTH AFRICA. 
 
THUMBS DOWN ON STANDING FORCE BUT SUPPORT FOR EARMARKING 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
9.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED FOR KHAMA\'S VIEWS ON THE STANDING 
FORCE CONCEPT.  KHAMA SAID HE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF 
A \"COMBINED STANDING FORCE,\" PRIMARILY FOR TWO REASONS.  FIRST, 
BECAUSE TO BE EFFECTIVE IT WOULD HAVE TO TRAIN TOGETHER -- 
SOMETHING MOST COUNTRIES IN THE REGION CANNOT AFFORD.  SECOND 
BECAUSE, IN KHAMA\'S VIEW, PARTICIPATION IN A COMBINED STANDING 
FORCE WOULD AMOUNT TO BOTSWANA SIGNING AWAY ITS SOVEREIGN RIGHT 
TO DECIDE, ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, WHEN AND WHERE TO SEND ITS 
TROOPS.  BY CONTRAST, KHAMA FAVORED CREATION OF A FORCE BASED 
ON EARMARKING SPECIFIC CONTINGENTS IN EACH PARTICIPATING 
MILITARY AND PREPARING THEM TO BE MOBILIZABLE WITHIN 48 HOURS. 
ODC CHIEF NOTED THAT EVEN UNDER NATO\'S INTEGRATED MILITARY 
COMMAND EACH NATION RETAINS THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO DETERMINE 
WHETHER OR NOT TO RELEASE ITS EARMARKED FORCES TO NATO COMMAND. 
 
LOTS OF QUESTIONS; NO DECISIONS 
------------------------------- 
 
10.  KHAMA REITERATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE MEETING DID NOT/NOT 
AGREE ON ANY STANDBY FORCE OPTION.  MANY QUESTIONS REMAINED, 
INCLUDING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SIZE OF SUCH A FORCE, 
COORDINATION MECHANISMS BETWEEN A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION AND THE 
UN, AND WHETHER A REQUEST TO BECOME INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT 
SITUATION WOULD BE INITIATED BY THE UN OR BY THE REGIONAL 
ORGANIZATION.  THERE WAS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER, THAT A COUNTRY 
ASKED BY THE UN TO DEPLOY FORCES SHOULD IN TURN SEEK UN 
SUPPORT.  RESPONDING TO A QUESTION FROM THE ODC CHIEF KHAMA 
SAID DEPLOYABILITY HAD NOT BEEN DISCUSSED.  HE EXPLAINED THAT 
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE DISCUSSION CENTERED ON A FORCE 
PERTAINING ONLY TO THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN (SADC) REGION, NOT 
BEYOND (E.G. TO BURUNDI). 
 
11.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THE U.S. HAS NO FIXED FORMULA 
IN MIND BUT IS EAGER TO RECEIVE AND EXAMINE OTHERS\' VIEWS ON 
REGIONAL PEACEKEEPING, PARTICULARLY IN PREPARATION FOR THE MAY 
MEETING AT THE NATIONAL WAR COLLEGE.  KHAMA REITERATED HIS 
LONG-STANDING CONCERN THAT ANY PEACEKEEPING ARRANGMENT FULLY 
RESPECT AND PRESERVE A COUNTRY\'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO DECIDE, ON 
A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, WHETHER, WHERE, AND WHEN TO DEPLOY ITS 
TROOPS.  HE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT PROPOSALS SUCH AS A 
CANADIAN ONE (UNFAMILIAR TO US) TO CREATE A STANDING RAPID 
DEPLOYMENT FORCE. 
 
THE FLS/ASAS/SADC CONNECTION 
----------------------------- 
 
12.  AMBASSADOR CLOSED BY ASKING HOW THE INTERSTATE COMMITTEE 
ON DEFENSE AND SECURITY FITS WITH SADC.  IN RESPONSE, KHAMA 
RECALLED THAT LAST YEAR IN ARUSHA COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAD DECIDED 
THEY DID NOT WANT TO BECOME PART OF SADC.  WHILE THE TRANSITION 
FROM OLD TO NEW ORGANIZATIONS IS CURRENTLY A BIT CONFUSED, 
KHAMA SAID THAT IN THE END, THE FRONTLINE STATES (FLS) WILL BE 
TRANSFORMED INTO THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STATES 
(ASAS) AND \"WE (I.E. THE COMMITTEE) SEE OURSELVES LINKED WITH 
ASAS.\"  IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION, KHAMA WENT ON TO 
SAY HE EXPECTED NO COORDINATION PROBLEMS BETWEEN ASAS AND SADC 
SINCE THE SAME COUNTRIES ARE MEMBERS OF BOTH GROUPS AND 
POLITICAL DECISIONS ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND PEACEKEEPING ARE 
MADE BY THE SAME LEADERS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13.  THREE THINGS STRUCK US ABOUT THE KHAMA BRIEFING:  ONE IS 
THE DETERMINATION AND SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH KHAMA AND HIS ARMY 
COMMANDER COLLEAGUES ARE APPROACHING THESE ISSUES; TWO IS THE 
ACTIVE AND SUPPORTIVE ROLE THAT SOUTH AFRICA IS NOW PLAYING IN 
THESE DISCUSSIONS; AND THREE IS THE DIFFICULTY OF COMING TO 
GRIPS WITH THE ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF FUTURE CONFLICT 
RESOLUTION/MANAGEMENT AND PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS. 
 
14.  WHILE WE ARE UNSURE OF THE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE MAY 
NATIONAL WAR COLLEGE MEETING, IT SEEMS, FROM WHERE WE SIT, THAT 
WE COULD MAKE A LARGE CONTRIBUTION BY HELPING COUNTRIES IN THIS 
REGION TO WORK OUT THE CONCEPTUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL BASIS ON 
WHICH FUTURE CONFLICT MANAGEMENT/PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS MAY 
REST.

REASON: 1.5(B) 
 
1.   CONTRARY TO WHAT PRESIDENT MASIRE\'S PRIVATE SECRETARY TOLD US 
LAST WEEK, LOUIS SELEPENG, PERMANENT SECRETARY FOR POLITICAL 
AFFAIRS IN THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE, CONFIDED TO THE AMBASSADOR 11/30 
THAT PRESIDENT MASIRE HAD DECLINED, IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF 
THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY, TO CALL A MEETING OF 
SADC HEADS OF STATE, TO DEVELOP A REGIONAL SOUTHERN AFRICAN 
STRATEGY ON NIGERIA. 
 
2.   SELEPENG SAID THAT BOTSWANA MAINTAINED THAT THE QUESTION 
OF NIGERIA WAS NOT A SADC ISSUE (I.E., THERE WAS NO DIRECT CORRELATION 
BETWEEN THE UNFORTUNATE DEVELOPMENTS IN NIGERIA AND SADC AS A 
CORPORATE REGIONAL BODY), AND PRESIDENT MANDELA HAD AGREED. 
THEREFORE, IT WAS DECIDED THAT PRESIDENT MANDELA WOULD CALL A 
MEETING OF REGIONAL LEADERS TO CONSIDER THE NIGERIA QUESTION, AND 
WOULD DO SO IN HIS CAPACITY AS SOUTH AFRICA\'S PRESIDENT BUT NOT IN 
THE NAME OF SADC.  SELEPENG NOTED THAT THE MANDELA-CALLED MEETING

3.   SELEPENG SAID THAT PRESIDENT MASIRE WAS PREPARED TO ATTEND THE 
MEETING AT ANY TIME FOLLOWING HIS RETURN FROM THE GCA MEETING IN 
HOLLAND.  MASIRE RETURNED TO BOTSWANA YESTERDAY, NOVEMBER 30. 
 
4.   FOR BLANEY AND CARTER-PERRY:  NIGERIA WILL INEVITABLY TURN UP 
DURING THE VICE PRESIDENT\'S BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH PRESIDENT 
MASIRE.  THE VP SHOULD BE WELL BRIEFED.

1.  SUMMARY:  BOTH THE GOB AND THE BOTSWANA WOMEN\'S NGO 
NETWORK ARE ACTIVELY DEMONSTRATING THEIR COMMITMENT TO 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BEIJING PLATFORM OF ACTION, 
BOTH AT THE NATIONAL AND THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB- 
REGIONAL LEVELS.  THE GOB IS SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKING 
PROGRESS ON SEVERAL FRONTS, INCLUDING ITS REVIEW OF 
POTENTIALLY DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATION, CONSULTATIVE 
PROCEDURES ON THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL 
FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW), JOINT 
GOB-NGO WORKSHOPS TO SPREAD THE BEIJING PLATFORM OF 
ACTION TO BOTSWANA\'S GRASSROOTS, AND OTHER IMPRESSIVE 
ACTIVITIES.  WHILE BOTSWANA\'S CUSTOMARY LEGAL TREATMENT 
OF WOMEN LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED, ALL BATSWANA 
CITIZENS CONTINUE TO USE BOTH MAGISTRATES\' COURTS AND 
CUSTOMARY COURTS INTERCHANGEABLY.  THE EMBASSY USED FY- 
95 116(E) FUNDS TO PROMOTE THE PRE-BEIJING PROCESS, AND 
IS POISED TO USE FY-96 116(E) FUNDS TO SUPPORT EFFORTS 
ALREADY UNDERWAY TO FURTHER THE BEIJING AGENDA, AS SOON 
AS THOSE FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE.  A KEY FOCUS OF THE 
SOUTHERN AFRICA REGIONAL DEMOCRACY FUND (SARDF) IS TO 
EMPOWER (SOUTHERN AFRICAN) WOMEN\'S ORGANIZATIONS TO 
PARTICIPATE MORE FULLY IN THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL 
PROCESS, AND USAID/RCSA HAS ALREADY SIGNED A USD250,000 
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH WOMEN IN LAW AND DEVELOPMENT 
IN SOUTHERN AFRICA (WILDAF) TO TRAIN SOUTHERN AFRICAN 
WOMEN PARLIAMENTARIANS.  WHILE SADC\'S EXECUTIVE 
SECRETARY HAS EXPRESSED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE CREATION OF 
A SADC DESK TO PROMOTE GENDER ISSUES, SUCH ISSUES WILL 
NOT LIKELY BE INCLUDED AS A SUBSTANTIVE AGENDA ITEM AT 
THE SADC SUMMIT IN MASERU THIS AUGUST.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
GOB CONSULTANCY TO ADDRESS DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATION 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2.  BOTSWANA LAWS GENERALLY REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY 
INCLUDE:  THE MARRIAGE LAW, THE MAINTENANCE LAW, AND THE 
PROPERTY LAW.  THE CURRENT MARRIAGE LAW, FOR EXAMPLE, 
DENIES WOMEN THE RIGHT TO SHARE EQUALLY IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF JOINT PROPERTY UNDER COMMON LAW 
MARRIAGE \"IN COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY\".  UNDER THIS 
ARRANGEMENT, THE HUSBAND HAS THE POWER TO SOLELY 
ADMINISTER JOINT PROPERTY, AND CAN SELL, LEASE, OR 
DONATE JOINT PROPERTY WITHOUT HIS WIFE\'S KNOWLEDGE OR 
CONSENT.  A WOMAN MARRIED UNDER COMMON LAW MARRIAGE IN 
COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY CANNOT MAKE A LEGALLY BINDING 
AGREEMENT WITHOUT HER HUSBAND\'S EXPLICIT CONSENT. 
 
3.  AS INDICATED IN REF B, THE GOB HAS BEGUN THE PROCESS 
OF COMMISSIONING A CONSULTANCY TO REVIEW NATIONAL 
LEGISLATION REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST WOMEN. 
DURING A RECENT MEETING WITH ACTING DHRF COORDINATOR, 
MS. VALENCIA MOGEGEH, THE GOB WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS 
COORDINATOR, EXPRESSED HER OPTIMISM THAT ALL 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO AMEND THE DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATION 
WOULD BE READY FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE ATTORNEY- 
GENERAL\'S OFFICE BY LATE 1996 OR EARLY 1997.  THE 
ATTORNEY-GENERAL\'S OFFICE WILL THEN REVIEW THE SUBMITTED 
RECOMMENDATIONS, AND PROPOSE SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE 
AMENDMENTS TO THE CABINET AND PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL. 
[NOTE:  THE \"RAPE LAW\" WAS ORIGINALLY INCLUDED IN THE 
LIST OF LEGISLATION REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST 
WOMEN TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE CONSULTANCY. 
IN RESPONSE TO POST-BEIJING PRESSURES TO AMEND DISCRIMINATORY 
LEGISLATION IN BOTSWANA, HOWEVER, PARLIAMENT HAS ALREADY 
AMENDED THE PENAL CODE TO REQUIRE THAT ALL RAPE CASES 
WILL BE TRIED IN CAMERA.  END NOTE.] 
 
 
LEGAL STATUS OF \"CUSTOMARY LAW\" REGARDING WOMEN 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  IN BOTSWANA, TWO LEGAL SYSTEMS CO-EXIST:  THE FORMAL 
LEGAL SYSTEM (BASED ON ROMAN DUTCH LAW, OR THE COMMON 
LAW OF THE CAPE COLONY DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD) AND 
THE CUSTOMARY LEGAL SYSTEM, EACH WITH ITS OWN SET OF 
RULES AND REMEDIES.  WHILE BOTSWANA CITIZENS USE THE TWO 
SYSTEMS INTERCHANGEABLY, MOST ENCOUNTER THE LEGAL SYSTEM 
THROUGH THE CUSTOMARY COURTS, WHICH ARE MORE NUMEROUS 
AND THEREFORE VIEWED AS MORE ACCESSIBLE.  THESE COURTS 
HANDLE MINOR OFFENSES INVOLVING LAND, MARITAL, AND 
PROPERTY DISPUTES, AND OPERATE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF 
TRADITIONAL LEADERS. 
 
5.  TREATMENT OF CASES IN FORMAL VS. CUSTOMARY LEGAL 
SYSTEMS DIFFERS ACCORDING TO THE VALUES, EXPECTATIONS, 
AND PRACTICES UNDERLYING EACH SYSTEM.  CHILD SUPPORT IS 
ONE EXAMPLE.  IF A SINGLE PREGNANT WOMAN GOES TO A 
MAGISTRATE\'S COURT, SHE WILL LIKELY BE AWARDED X PULA 
PER MONTH IN CHILD SUPPORT, TO BE PAID BY THE FATHER OF 
THE CHILD.  IF THE SAME WOMAN GOES TO A CUSTOMARY COURT, 
HOWEVER, THE FATHER OF THE CHILD WOULD BE REQUIRED TO 
PAY \"DAMAGES FOR SEDUCTION,\" BUT THE LONG-TERM WELFARE 
OF THE CHILD WOULD FALL TO THE WOMAN\'S FAMILY. 
 
6.  OTHER ASPECTS OF CUSTOMARY LAW ARE POTENTIALLY 
DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST WOMEN, AND MAY REINFORCE VIOLENCE 
AGAINST WOMEN, A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN BOTSWANA.  UNDER 
CUSTOMARY LAW AND IN COMMON RURAL PRACTICE, FOR EXAMPLE, 
MEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO \"CHASTISE\" THEIR WIVES, WHICH 
0FTEN TRANSLATES INTO PHYSICAL BEATINGS. 
 
AREAS OF DIVERGENCE BETWEEN LAW AND PRACTICE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  EXAMINING THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF DIVERGENCE 
BETWEEN LAW AND PRACTICE REGARDING THE LEGAL STATUS OF 
WOMEN IN BOTSWANA MAY BE PREMATURE, AN EXERCISE MORE 
APPROPRIATELY CONDUCTED AFTER NON-DISCRIMINATORY 
LEGISLATION HAS BEEN APPROVED BY PARLIAMENT (SEE PARA 
3).  GENERALLY SPEAKING, HOWEVER, BOTSWANA\'S LEGAL 
SYSTEM SUFFERS FROM SEVERE CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS WHICH 
LIMIT ACCESS TO SPEEDY JUDICIAL ACTION FOR ALL 
CITIZENS -- AND FROM A SHARP DIVERGENCE BASED ON 
AVAILABILITY OF COUNSEL TO THE RICH AND POOR -- A 
FAMILIAR FACTOR, BUT ONE THAT HAS MORE SEVERE 
CONSEQUENCES IN A SYSTEM WITHOUT THE SAFEGUARDS AND 
PUBLIC SERVICES AVAILABLE IN OUR OWN.  THESE 
IMPERFECTIONS GENERALLY APPLY TO ALL BATSWANA ALIKE, 
REGARDLESS OF GENDER. 
 
DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT OF GOB TO BEIJING PLATFORM 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8.  THE GOB HAS PUBLICLY COMMITTED ITSELF TO 
IMPLEMENTING THE BEIJING PLATFORM FOR ACTION NATIONALLY, 
AS WELL AS TAKING A LEADING ROLE IN FACILITING THE 
ACHIEVEMENT OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN POST-REGIONAL OBJECTIVES 
(SEE REFS B AND C).  THE GOB\'S POST-BEIJING ACTIVITIES 
ARE COORDINATED BY THE WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS DIVISION IN THE 
MINISTRY OF LABOR AND HOME AFFAIRS, HEADED BY MINISTER 
B.K. TEMANE.  TO DATE, THE GOB HAS DEM0NSTRATED AN 
INTENTION TO CARRY THROUGH ON PROMISES MADE.  SINCE 
SEPTEMBER 1995, FOR EXAMPLE, THE GOB HAS 
 
     -- MET WITH THE WOMEN\'S NGO COALITION TO DISCUSS 
     AND AGREE ON THE BROAD OUTLINE OF BOTSWANA\'S 
     NATIONAL PLAN OF ACTION, REVISIT THE SIX PRIORITY 
     AREAS AGREED UPON AT THE PRE-BEIJING NATIONAL 
     WORKSHOP, AND DEVELOP PRACTICAL STRATEGIES BASED ON 
     THESE PRIORITY AREAS; 
 
     -- BEGUN CO-HOSTING WITH THE NGO COALITION SEVERAL 
     LOCAL, DISTRICT-LEVEL, AND REGIONAL \"FEEDBACK 
     WORKSHOPS\" THROUGHOUT BOTSWANA TO CARRY THE BEIJING 
     PROGRAM FOR ACTION BACK TO THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL, 
     INVOLVING WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THE 
     PROCESS OF DETERMINING HOW THE BEIJING PLATFORM 
     SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN BOTSWANA; 
 
     -- COMMISSIONED A CONSULTANCY TO REVIEW NATIONAL 
     LEGISLATION GENERALLY REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY 
     AGAINST WOMEN (SEE PARA 3); 
 
     -- INITIATED AND COMPLETED CONSULTATIVE PROCEDURES 
     ON THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS 
     OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW) AND RELATED 
     BOTSWANA LAWS; 
 
     -- EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF BOTSWANA\'S NATIONAL 
     POLICY ON WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT, FIRST DRAFTED BY 
     THE GOB IN 1988 AND REVISED SEVERAL TIMES IN 
     C0NSULTATION WITH WOMEN\'S NGOS; 
 
     -- INVITED THE WOMEN\'S NGO COALITION TO SUBMIT A 
     SECTION ON WOMEN\'S/GENDER ISSUES FOR INCLUSION IN 
     BOTSWANA\'S FORTHCOMING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
     (NDP-8, 1997-2001), THE BLUEPRINT FOR NATIONAL 
     DEVELOPMENT DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS; 
 
     -- CO-HOSTED (WITH THE WOMEN\'S NGO COALITION) THE 
     FIRST SOUTHERN AFRICA SUB-REGIONAL P0ST-BEIJING 
     WORKSHOP, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED A SUB- 
     REGIONAL PLAN FOR ACTION; AND 
 
     -- AGREED (WITH THE WOMEN\'S NGO COALITION) TO HOUSE 
     THE POST-BEIJING SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB-REGIONAL 
     SECRETARIAT IN GABORONE. 
 
 
DEM0CRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS FUND 
------------------------------- 
 
9.  THIS EMBASSY IS ANXIOUS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 116(E) 
MONIES TO SUPPORT THE IMPRESSIVE ACTIVITIES ALREADY 
INITIATED BY THE GOB AND THE WOMEN\'S NGO COMMUNITY IN 
BOTSWANA.  WE WERE PLEASED TO LEARN THAT THE HOLDS ON 
DHRF FUNDS HAVE BEEN LIFTED, AND LOOK FORWARD TO 
RECEIVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FUND ADVICE OF ALLOWANCE SO 
THAT THE DHRF COORDINATOR CAN BEGIN OBLIGATING FUNDS. 
FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT OF OUR PROPOSED PROJECTS FOR FY-96 
ARE GEARED TOWARD PROMOTING WOMEN\'S CAPACITY-BUILDING 
ACTIVITIES OR COMBATTING RAPE AND SEXUAL ABUSE. 
PROJECTS INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SUPPORT OF POST- 
BEIJING \"FEEDBACK\" WORKSHOPS (SEE PARA 8), SCHOOL-BASED 
INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKSHOPS RELATED TO SEXUAL ABUSE, 
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL WOMEN\'S P0LITICAL 
CAUCUS. 
 
 
SADC PLANS TO PROMOTE GENDER ISSUES 
----------------------------------- 
 
10.  THE AMBASSADOR AND USAID/RCSA DIRECTOR MET WITH DR. 
KAIRE MBUENDE, SADC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, ON JUNE 18. 
RESPONDING TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION OF WHETHER SADC 
PLANS TO DEVELOP A SPECIFIC MECHANISM TO PROMOTE THE 
SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB-REGIONAL POST-BEIJING AGENDA, DR. 
MBUENDE RESPONDED THAT SADC WILL ESTABLISH A DESK TO 
PROMOTE GENDER ISSUES SUB-REGIONALLY.  ACCORDING TO THE 
SADC SECRETARIAT\'S INFORMATION OFFICER, HOWEVER, IT IS 
DOUBTFUL WHETHER GENDER ISSUES WILL BE A SUBSTANTIVE 
AGENDA ITEM AT THE AUGUST SADC SUMMIT IN MASERU. 
 
11.  NOTING THAT THE OBSTACLES TO GENDER EQUALITY WERE 
C0MMON TO MOST COUNTRIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, THE 
AMBASSADOR RAISED THE IMPORTANCE OF A REGIONAL APPROACH 
TO GENDER ISSUES DURING HIS JUNE 20 FAREWELL CALL ON 
PRESIDENT MASIRE, THE CHAIRMAN OF SADC, AND SUGGESTED 
THAT THE SADC SECRETARIAT, WITH BOTSWANA ACTING AS A 
CATALYST, MIGHT BE ABLE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN 
THIS AREA.  MASIRE RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 
ISSUE AN DISCUSSED BOTSWANA\'S APPROACH BUT DID NOT 
DIRECLY RESPOND TO THE REGIONAL STRATEGY ISSUE. 
 
 
SOUTERN AFRICAN REGIONAL DEMOCRACY FUND (SARDF) 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
12. ONE OF BHE THREE FOCUSES OF THE SARDF\'S INTERIM 
TRATEGY -- TO \"EMPOWER WOMEN\'S ORGANIZATIONS TO 
ARTICIPATE MORE FULLY IN THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL 
PROCESS\" -- AIMS DIRECTLY AT PROMOTING THE STATUSOF 
WOMEN IN THE REGION.  THE SARDF\'S FIRST AWARD WAS A 
USD250,000 COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH WOMEN IN LAW AND 
DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA (WILDAF), A REGIONAL 
ORGANIZATION HEADQUARTERED IN ZIMBABWE, FOR TRAINING OF 
WOMEN PARLIAMENTARIANS.  ASSISTING IN THE NETWORKING OF 
NGOS ORIENTED TOWARD WOMEN\'S ISSUES IN THE REGION FITS 
SQUARELY WITHIN SARDF PRIORITIES, AND A PROPOSAL FROM 
NAMIBIAN NGO LEADERS 0R THE GABORONE-BASED REGIONAL 
POST-BEIJING SECRETARIAT, FOR THAT MATTER, F0R SUCH 
REGIONAL COOPERATION WITH COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER SOUTHERN 
AFRICAN COUNTRIES WOULD BE WELCOME. 
 
13. COMMENT:  THIS EMBASSY IS CONTINUALLY IMPRESSED AT 
THE LEVEL AND APPARENT SINCERITY OF THE GOB\'S COMMITMENT 
TO PROMOTING GENUINE REFORMS TOWARD EQUAL RECOGNITION OF 
WOMEN BOTH NATIONALLY AND AT THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB- 
REGIONAL LEVEL.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE REMARKABLE MEASURE 
OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOB AND WOMEN\'S NGOS, IN 
PARTICULAR, CAN SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER SADC 
COUNTRIES.  DAILY COMMUNICATION AND SUBSTANTIVE 
COLLABORATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND NGO REPRESENTATIVES 
IS EXPEDITING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEANINGFUL CHANGE, 
AND IS VISIBLE BOTH AT THE NATIONAL AND THE GRASSROOTS 
LEVELS, WHERE JOINT GOB-NGO POST-BEIJING W0RKSHOPS ARE 
BEING HELD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO POPULARIZE THE 
BEIJING PLATFORM AND DEMOCRATIZE THE PROCESS OF 
TRANSLATING THAT PLATFORM TO BOTSWANA\'S UNIQUE 
CIRCUMSTANCES.  BOTSWANA HAS COME A LONG WAY ON GENDER 
ISSUES IN A VERY SHORT TIME. 
 
14.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  WHILE SADC CONTINUES TO PAY LIP 
SERVICE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING GENDER ISSUES AT 
THE SUB-REGIONAL LEVEL, THE TRANSLATION OF PLEDGES INTO 
ACTION MAY REQUIRE CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE PART OF 
THIS EMBASSY, OTHER DONORS, AND THE SUB-REGIONAL POST- 
BEIJING BODY THAT EMERGED FROM THE NOVEMBER 1995 
WORKSHOP HERE IN GABORONE (SEE REF C).  SADC\'S RESOURCES 
OFTEN DO NOT MEASURE UP TO ITS COMMITMENTS, AND THE 
GENDER ISSUES AREA IS NO EXCEPTION.  BUILDING SADC\'S 
CAPACITY TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH WOMEN\'S ISSUES IS AN 
AREA WHERE THE U.S. MIGHT PLAY A ROLE.

1.  SUMMARY.  SOUTHERN AFRICA IS INCREASINGLY TOUTED AS THE 
CONTINENT\'S ENGINE OF GROWTH, WITH THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN 
DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) DRIVING THE TRAIN.  SADC HAS 
MATURED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE ITS FORMATION IN 1992, BUT FORGING 
REGIONAL COOPERATION FROM NATIONALIST PROCLIVITIES IS AS 
DELICATE A PROCESS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 
AND NORTH AMERICA.  THE SADC SECRETARIAT, WITH ITS AMORPHOUS 
ROLE AND LIMITED RESOURCES, HAS PROVEN TO BE NO MATCH FOR 
STRONG NATIONAL LEADERS WITH SOMETIMES CONFLICTING IDEOLOGICAL 
PERSPECTIVES, WHO HAVE OFTEN DOMINATED THE ORGANIZATION.  AS 
ITS MANDATE EXPANDS BEYOND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO 
STATESMANSHIP, SADC IS STRUGGLING TO LIVE UP TO THE WORLD\'S 
EPXECTATIONS.  WHETHER SADC\'S ORIGINAL STRUCTURE IS UP TO THE 
TASK IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEBATE, AND PROMISES TO FEATURE 
PROMINENTLY AT THE SEPTEMBER SADC SUMMIT IN MALAWI. 
 
2.  NONETHELESS, SADC STATES HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN JUST 
GEOGRAPHY, AND THEREIN LIES SOME OF THE ORGANIZATION\'S TRUE 
POTENTIAL.  THE 12 COUNTRIES SHARE A CONSENSUAL APPROACH TO 
REGIONAL DECISION-MAKING, ESPOUSE (BUT DON\'T ALWAYS PRACTICE) 
DEMOCRATIC IDEALS, AND PROMOTE A LARGELY FREE MARKET APPROACH 
TO DOING BUSINESS.  ULTIMATELY, SOUTH AFRICA, AS THE 
ORGANIZATION\'S DOMINANT MEMBER, REMAINS THE KEY TO BALANCED 
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT.  ITS NEIGHBORS ARE KEEPING AN INTERESTED 
IF WARY EYE ON THE INDICATORS OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S COMMITMENT TO 
REGIONAL INTEGRATION.  FOR SADC TO ACHIEVE ITS DUAL GOALS OF 
BALANCED REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL STABILITY 
AND SECURITY, SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS SADC PARTNERS WILL HAVE TO 
BACK THE REGIONAL INTEGRATION CONCEPT WITH MORE THAN WORDS. 
THEY HAVE TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE AND 
DIRECTION.  NOW THEY ARE FACING THE TRUE TEST OF REGIONAL 
INTEGRATION: IMPLEMENTING REFORMS THAT MAY INVOLVE DIFFICULT 
COMPROMISES BY SOME FOR THE GOOD OF ALL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GENESIS 
------- 
 
3.  THE 12-MEMBER SADC EVOLVED FROM THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN 
DEVELOPMENT COORDINATING CONFERENCE (SADCC), WHICH WAS FOUNDED 
IN 1980 BY THE FRONTLINE STATES (FLS) TO ADVANCE REGIONAL 
COOPERATION AGAINST APARTHEID.  WITH APARTHEID\'S DEMISE, 
SADCC\'S ROLE SHIFTED FROM ISOLATING APARTHEID TO PROMOTING THE 
FLS\' ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  IN AUGUST, 1992, \"SADCC\" EMERGED 
AS \"SADC,\" WITH AN UPDATED MANDATE OF FOSTERING ECONOMIC 
PROSPERITY, DEVELOPMENT, AND STABILITY THROUGH REGIONAL TRADE 
LIBERALIZATION AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION. 
 
4.  WHEREAS SADCC HAD WORKED TO COORDINATE MEMBER STATES\' 
ECONOMIES ON SPECIFIC PROJECTS WITH REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS, THE 
NEW SADC HAS FOCUSED ON INTEGRATING STATES\' ACTIVITIES INTO 
REGIONAL ACTION.  SOUTH AFRICA, THE FORMER PARIAH, NOW PLAYS A 
PIVOTAL ROLE IN SADC\'S REGIONAL INTEGRATION STRATEGY, AS DOES 
THE STABILITY OF THOSE COUNTRIES (MOZAMBIQUE, ANGOLA, NAMIBIA) 
EMERGING FROM CIVIL WAR.  THE 1992 SADC TREATY COMMITS MEMBER 
COUNTRIES TO HARMONIZE AND RATIONALIZE THEIR DEVELOPMENT 
POLICIES AND STRATEGIES; AN AMBITIOUS GOAL FOR 12 COUNTRIES 
WITH WIDELY DIFFERING CAPACITIES FOR GROWTH.  THE TREATY IS 
ENFORCEABLE THROUGH SANCTIONS, WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED AGAINST A 
MEMBER STATE THAT 1) PERSISTENTLY FAILS TO FULFILL ITS 
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SADC TREATY, 2) IMPLEMENTS POLICIES 
WHICH UNDERMINE THE PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES OF SADC, OR 3) 
IS MORE THAN ONE YEAR OVERDUE IN PAYING ITS DUES WITHOUT 
HAVING OBTAINED A DISPENSATION FROM SADC. 
 
SUMMIT OF HEADS OF STATE 
------------------------ 
 
5.  THE TEN ORIGINAL MEMBERS (ANGOLA, BOTSWANA, LESOTHO, 
MALAWI, MOZAMBIQUE, NAMIBIA, SWAZILAND, TANZANIA, ZAMBIA, 
ZIMBABWE) WELCOMED SOUTH AFRICA INTO SADC IN AUGUST, 1994, 
FOLLOWED BY MAURITIUS IN 1995.  SOUTH AFRICA\'S PRESIDENT 
MANDELA HAS BEEN CHAIRMAN OF THE SADC SUMMIT OF HEADS OF STATE 
AND GOVERNMENT (SUMMIT) SINCE 1996, REPLACING BOTSWANA\'S 
PRESIDENT MASIRE WHO HELD THE OFFICE SINCE SADC\'S INCEPTION. 
AS THE ULTIMATE POLICY-MAKING INSTITUTION OF SADC, THE SUMMIT 
SETS THE COMMUNITY\'S OVERALL POLICY DIRECTION, CREATES 
COMMISSIONS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, AND APPOINTS THE EXECUTIVE 
AND DEPUTY EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE SADC SECRETARIAT, 
LOCATED IN GABORONE.  THE NEXT SUMMIT MEETING, SCHEDULED TO 
BEGIN ON SEPTEMBER 8 IN MALAWI, IS EXPECTED TO TACKLE 
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES RANGING FROM EXPANDING SADC\'S MEMBERSHIP, 
TO RESTRUCTURING THE ORGANIZATION, TO FINALIZING SADC\'S 
POSITION ON TRADE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). 
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS 
-------------------- 
 
6.  THE SUMMIT IS ADVISED BY A COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, WHICH 
ALSO APPROVES SADC POLICIES, STRATEGIES AND WORK PROGRAMS. 
COMPRISED OF MINISTERS FROM EACH STATE (GENERALLY PLANNING OR 
FINANCE MINISTERS), THE COUNCIL OVERSEES THE FUNCTIONING AND 
DEVELOPMENT OF SADC AND ENSURES POLICY IMPLEMENTATION.  IT 
ALSO ASSIGNS SPECIFIC AREAS OF COOPERATION TO SECTOR 
COORDINATING UNITS ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE MINISTRY 
IN EACH MEMBER STATE.  A STANDING COMMITTEE OF OFFICIALS, 
COMPRISED OF A PERMANENT SECRETARY FROM EACH MEMBER STATE, 
ACTS AS TECHNICAL ADVISOR TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. 
MEMBERS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ALSO SERVE AS NATIONAL 
CONTACT POINTS RESPONSIBLE FOR SADC MATTERS, LINKING OTHER 
AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT WITH SADC. 
 
SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS 
------------------------- 
 
7.  SADC\'S EIGHTEEN SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS CURRENTLY ARE 
DIVIDED AMONGST THE TWELVE MEMBERS, WITH A SECTORAL COMMITTEE 
OF MINISTERS SUPERVISING EACH COORDINATING UNIT.  RANGING FROM 
ENERGY (ANGOLA) TO TOURISM (MAURITIUS) TO LABOR (ZAMBIA), THE 
COORDINATING UNITS SPEARHEAD THE REGIONAL POLICIES AND 
PROGRAMS FOR EACH PARTICULAR SECTOR.  INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES 
PROVIDE FUNDING AND STAFF TO ADMINISTER THEIR RESPECTIVE 
SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS, WHICH FUNCTION AS PART OF THAT 
STATE\'S NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 
 
8.  THE CAPACITY OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO STEER SADC\'S 
PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR SECTORS VARIES CONSIDERABLY.  LOGJAMS 
HAVE IMPEDED PROGRESS WHEN EXPERTISE, EFFICIENCY, OR DOMESTIC 
DISTRACTIONS PREVENT THE MINISTRY FROM PROMOTING ITS SECTOR 
EFFECTIVELY AND DYNAMICALLY.  ANGOLA\'S PREOCCUPATION WITH 
RESOLVING ITS CIVIL WAR HAS WEAKENED ITS ABILITY TO LEAD SADC 
ON ENERGY ISSUES, THE SECTOR IT HEADS AND ARGUABLY ONE OF THE 
SECTORS MOST CRITICAL TO THE REGION\'S MODERNIZATION. 
SWAZILAND\'S LACK OF EXPERTISE (AND FAILURE TO SEEK IT OUT) IN 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN BLAMED FOR THE SLOW 
PROGRESS IN THAT VITAL SECTOR.  ADDED TO SUCH WEAKNESSES IS A 
LACK OF INTER-SECTORAL COORDINATION THAT FURTHER DISRUPTS 
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.  OFTEN BLAMED FOR SADC\'S UNEVEN 
PERFORMANCE, THE COORDINATING UNITS REVEAL THE HANDICAP THAT 
THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL DISPARITIES AMONG THE SADC 
COUNTRIES CAUSES. 
 
CONSOLIDATION PROPOSAL: EFFICIENT BUT UNPOPULAR 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
9.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO REVITALIZE SADC AND IMPROVE ITS 
EFFECTIVENESS, MEMBERS COMMISSIONED A REVIEW OF THE 
ORGANIZATION\'S STRUCTURE IN 1995.  THE REPORT RECOMMENDED 
CONSOLIDATING THE COORDINATING UNITS INTO FIVE DIRECTORATES 
THAT WOULD FOCUS MORE ON POLICY THAN PROJECT COORDINATION. 
EXISTING SECTORS WOULD BE CLUSTERED TOGETHER IN KEY AREAS OF 
COOPERATION FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY: 1) AGRICULTURE, NATURAL 
RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT; 2) HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT, 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; 3) INFRASTRUCTURE, COMMUNICATIONS AND 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; 4) TRADE, INDUSTRY, INVESTMENT AND 
FINANCE; AND 5) COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, CULTURE AND 
INFORMATION.  A POSSIBLE SIXTH DIRECTORATE FOR WATER RESOURCE 
MANAGEMENT MIGHT BE REQUIRED, ACCORDING TO THE REPORT.  THE 
DIRECTORATES WOULD BE FUNDED BY REGIONAL RESOURCES (IN PART TO 
REDUCE DEPENDENCY ON DONORS) AND STAFFED BY REGIONAL 
PROFESSIONALS. 
 
10.  WHILE THIS MAY BE A MORE EFFICIENT APPROACH, IT HAS 
ENCOUNTERED FIERCE RESISTANCE FROM A NUMBER OF SADC STATES, 
SOME OF WHICH WOULD LOSE THEIR SECTOR OF RESPONSIBILITY.  AS 
THE REPORT POINTS OUT, SADC\'S PRESENT STRUCTURE HAS ENSURED A 
SENSE OF \"OWNERSHIP\" BY MEMBER STATES AND AVOIDED EXCESSIVE 
TENSIONS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION BY EQUALIZING THE FLOW OF 
BENEFITS.  DECIDING WHERE THE DIRECTORATES WOULD BE BASED 
WOULD LIKELY INVOLVE A STICKY, AND HIGHLY CHARGED, DEBATE 
AMIDST FEARS OF CERTAIN STATES DOMINATING THE ORGANIZATION. 
AS USAID DISCOVERED IN 1996 WHEN SADC MEMBERS CRITICIZED THE 
SECRETARIAT FOR SIGNING AGREEMENTS ON SADC\'S BEHALF, 
ENTHUSIASM FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION HAS NOT OVERCOME CONCERNS 
ABOUT CEDING NATIONAL CONTROL, IF NOT SOVEREIGNTY, TO A 
CENTRAL, SUPRA-NATIONAL SECRETARIAT. 
 
11.  COST CONCERNS MAY ALSO WORK AGAINST CONSOLIDATION. 
CURRENTLY, EACH STATE CONTROLS EXPENDITURES FOR THE 
OPERATIONAL EXPENSES OF ITS SECTOR.  UNDER THE NEW PROPOSAL, 
MEMBERS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A CENTRAL FUND THAT WOULD FINANCE 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE DIRECTORATES.  SOME STATES FEAR THIS 
MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENT, WHICH 
LETS THEM DECIDE HOW MUCH (OR HOW LITTLE) TO SPEND ON THEIR 
SADC SECTOR OF RESPONSIBILITY.  THE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT 
CONTRIBUTIONS MIGHT BE DETERMINED BASED ON POPULATION, GDP, OR 
GDP PER CAPITA; OPTIONS THAT AGAIN RAISE CONCERNS OF DOMINANCE 
BY SOME MEMBERS.  THE RECOMMENDATION THAT SADC SHOULD SOLICIT 
GREATER PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT IN ITS PROGRAM OF ACTION HAS 
ALSO GENERATED CONTROVERSY. 
 
12.  THE REPORT\'S PROPOSALS WERE DISCUSSED BY DELEGATIONS FROM 
THE 12 SADC STATES AT A RECENT REGIONAL WORKSHOP IN GABORONE 
ON THE RATIONALIZATION OF THE SADC PROGRAM OF ACTION.  AFTER A 
CONTENTIOUS OPENING SESSION, THE WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS CHANGED 
THE FORMAT TO CLOSED SESSION DISCUSSIONS.  THE WORKSHOP\'S 
RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED AT THE UPCOMING COUNCIL OF 
MINISTERS\' MEETING IN BLANTYRE AT WHICH THE RESTRUCTURING 
ISSUE IS EXPECTED TO TOP THE AGENDA. 
 
 
SADC SECRETARIAT 
---------------- 
 
13.  THE REPORT ALSO TARGETED THE SADC SECRETARIAT FOR 
STREAMLINING, SUGGESTING THAT ITS FUNCTIONS BE LIMITED TO 
POLICY HARMONIZATION, LOBBYING, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND 
INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, AND ADMINISTRATION.  CURRENTLY, THE 
SECRETARIAT\'S PROFESSIONAL STAFF IS RESPONSIBLE FOR STRATEGIC 
PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF SADC PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS GENERAL 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING FINANCES AND 
DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION.  OPERATIONAL COSTS OF RUNNING THE 
SECRETARIAT ARE FUNDED FROM CONTRIBUTIONS BY MEMBER STATES IN 
EQUAL AMOUNTS SET BY THE COUNCIL. 
 
14.  HEADQUARTERED IN GABORONE, THE SECRETARIAT HAS BEEN 
CRITICIZED AS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE.  SOME MEMBERS 
ADVOCATE ABOLISHING THE SECRETARIAT ALTOGETHER, ALTHOUGH NO 
REALISTIC ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN PRESENTED.  EARLIER THIS 
YEAR, THE SECRETARIAT CAME UNDER ATTACK FOR MISMANAGEMENT, 
WITH SOME MEMBERS REPORTEDLY CALLING FOR THE REMOVAL OF 
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY DR. KAIRE MBUENDE OF NAMIBIA.  DR. MBUENDE 
ESCAPED RELATIVELY UNSCATHED, THOUGH HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE HAS 
NOT MADE HIM POPULAR.  SADC HEADS OF STATE WILL DECIDE AT THE 
MALAWI MEETING WHETHER TO REAPPOINT DR. MBUENDE FOR ANOTHER 
FOUR YEARS WHEN HIS PRESENT TERM EXPIRES IN DECEMBER.  AS THE 
RESTRUCTURING REPORT POINTS OUT, MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS LODGED 
AGAINST THE SECRETARIAT COULD BE ADDRESSED BY CLARIFYING THE 
SECRETARIAT\'S MANDATE AND ALLOCATING SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR 
IT TO IMPLEMENT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. 
 
 
PROTOCOLS: JUST ONE OF MANY STEPS 
--------------------------------- 
 
15.  WHILE IT GRAPPLES WITH RATIONALIZING ITS PROGRAM OF 
ACTION AND STRUCTURE, THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR SADC TO BUILD A REPUTATION AS AN INFLUENTIAL REGIONAL 
BLOCK.  THE WEAK LINK AT THIS STAGE SEEMS TO BE TOO MANY 
OPPORTUNITIES TOO SOON, WITH SADC OUTGROWING ITS RESOURCES AND 
CAPABILITIES, ACCORDING TO THE RESTRUCTURING REPORT.  SADC HAS 
FORGED AN ARRAY OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TIES IN THE 
FORM OF PROTOCOLS THAT AFFIRM GENERAL PRINCIPLES; NOW IT IS 
FACED WITH THE COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING TASK OF PUTTING 
FLESH ON THE BONES OF THOSE PROTOCOLS BEFORE EVENTS OVERTAKE 
THE PROCESS.  USAID\'S REGIONAL CENTER FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA 
(RCSA) IS FUNDING WORKSHOPS AND PROGRAMS TO SPEED UP 
IMPLEMENTATION OF SADC POLICY AGREEMENTS AND PROTOCOLS AND TO 
ENSURE THE FINAL PRODUCTS REFLECT THE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF 
ALL STAKEHOLDERS. 
 
16.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE MOMENTUM FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THIS 
BURGEONING REGION PUSHES SADC STATES INTO ACTION, SOMETIMES 
UNILATERALLY, WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF LONG-TERM, COORDINATED 
REGIONAL PLANNING.  NAMIBIA\'S RECENT PLAN TO DIVERT WATER FROM 
THE OKAVANGO RIVER, WHICH ORIGINATES IN THE ANGOLAN HIGHLANDS 
AND EMPTIES INTO BOTSWANA\'S FAMED OKAVANGO DELTA, HIGHLIGHTED 
THE NEED FOR A REGIONAL APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT OF SHARED 
WATERCOURSES.  MEMBER STATES SIGNED THE SADC PROTOCOL ON 
SHARED WATERCOURSES IN 1995 BUT IT WILL BE MONTHS BEFORE THAT 
IS TRANSLATED INTO POLICIES AND ACTION.  DROUGHT-PRONE NAMIBIA 
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WAIT FOR REGIONAL COORDINATION, THOUGH IT 
HAS ENGAGED IN REGULAR CONSULTATIONS WITH THE BOTSWANA 
GOVERNMENT REGARDING THE PIPELINE PROJECT\'S IMPLEMENTATION. 
 
17.  THE PLIGHT OF THE SADC TRADE PROTOCOL, ONE OF THE 
ORGANIZATION\'S PRIMARY RAISON D\'ETRE, DEMONSTRATES THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH, TOO FAST.  HEATED 
DEBATE OVER SUCH CONTENTIOUS POINTS AS FREE MOVEMENT OF 
CAPITAL AND LABOR, TARIFF REDUCTIONS, STANDARDIZATION OF 
REGULATIONS AND LEGAL PROCEDURES HAS MADE PROGRESS ON 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRADE PROTOCOL (RATIFIED BY ONLY TWO 
COUNTRIES TO DATE) PAINFULLY SLOW.  A REGION-WIDE SHORTAGE OF 
EXPERTS TO NEGOTIATE COMPLICATED TARIFF REDUCTIONS ADDS TO 
EXISTING CAPACITY DISPARITIES WITHIN SADC, MAKING IT EVEN MORE 
DIFFICULT TO FINALIZE PROTOCOL DETAILS.  (REFTEL A). 
 
18.  IN THE MEANTIME, SOME SADC STATES ARE NEGOTIATING AND 
SIGNING BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENTS WHILE OTHERS DEFER 
NMGOTIATIONS TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE REGIONAL 
AGREEMENT.  SOUTH AFRICA HAS HELD UP ITS TRADE DISCUSSIONS 
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION, CLAIMING THAT IT CANNOT SUBMIT ITS 
PROPOSAL FOR A FREE TRADE PACT WITH THE EU UNTIL THE SADC 
TRADE PROTOCOL TERMS HAVE BEEN FINALIZED, ACCORDING TO PRESS 
REPORTS.  AT A RECENT MEETING IN TANZANIA, SADC TRADE 
MINISTERS WERE ABLE TO AGREE ON A GENERAL TIMETABLE FOR 
NEGOTIATIONS ON A PROPOSAL TO FREE REGIONAL TRADE EXCHANGES 
WITHIN EIGHT YEARS; A START, BUT A LONG WAY FROM PROCLAIMING A 
SADC FREE TRADE AREA. 
 
 
POLITICAL ORGAN 
--------------- 
 
19.  RECOGNIZING THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPENDS ON 
POLITICAL STABILITY, SADC HAS BROADENED ITS MISSION TO INCLUDE 
POLITICS AND SECURITY.  IN 1995, MEMBERS ESTABLISHED THE ORGAN 
FOR POLITICS, SECURITY AND DEFENSE (POLITICAL ORGAN) TO 
PROMOTE COOPERATION ON POLITICAL AND SECURITY ISSUES OF A 
REGIONAL NATURE.  CURRENTLY CHAIRED BY ZIMBABWE\'S PRESIDENT 
MUGABE, THE POLITICAL ORGAN IS AIMED AT CONFLICT PREVENTION 
AND MANAGEMENT.  THE GREAT LAKES CRISES AND THE AFRICAN CRISIS 
RESPONSE INITIATIVE (ACRI) PRESENTED TWO RECENT OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR SADC TO RESPOND REGIONALLY TO EVENTS OF GLOBAL IMPORTANCE. 
MUGABE\'S FAILURE TO CONVENE THE ORGAN TO ADDRESS EITHER ISSUE 
CREATED A VOID WHERE SADC MIGHT HAVE HAD AN INFLUENTIAL VOICE. 
HIS TIGHT REIN NOT ONLY PREVENTED SADC FROM TAKING A FORMAL 
POSITION, IT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES TO 
ACT OFFICIALLY, OUT OF DEFERENCE TO THE REGIONAL BODY. 
 
20.  ZIMBABWE\'S LACK OF DECISIVE RESPONSE TO UNFOLDING 
SECURITY CONCERNS MAY BE PART OF AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN 
MUGABE AND MANDELA TO ALTER THE PROFILE OF THE POLITICAL ORGAN 
WITHIN THE SADC ORGANIZATION, BOTSWANA DEFENSE FORCE (BDF) 
COMMANDER LT. GEN. IAN KHAMA SAID AT A JUNE MEETING WITH 
ACTING A/S TWADDELL IN WASHINGTON (REFTEL A).  KHAMA 
SPECULATED THAT MANDELA MIGHT BE SEEKING TO RE-POSITION THE 
ORGAN AS A SECTOR RATHER THAN A SEPARATE SADC ENTITY IN ORDER 
TO CURB MUGABE\'S TENDENCY TO USE HIS POSITION AS ORGAN 
CHAIRPERSON TO SPEAK UNILATERALLY ON SADC\'S BEHALF.  (NOTE. 
REFTEL B REFLECTS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON PROPOSALS TO 
CONSOLIDATE THE SADC AND ORGAN CHAIRMANSHIPS.  END NOTE.)  IF 
KHAMA IS RIGHT, MANDELA (AND PERHAPS OTHERS) MAY HAVE HONED IN 
ON TWO IMPEDIMENTS THAT HAVE WEAKENED SADC\'S ABILITY TO 
CONSOLIDATE ITS POWER AS A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION: 
PERSONALITIES AND COHESION. 
 
 
HOW BIG IS \"SOUTHERN\" AFRICA 
---------------------------- 
 
21.  HOW SADC CAN AND SHOULD FUNCTION TO PROMOTE REGIONALISM 
IS STILL BEING DEBATED.  THE INFLUENCE OF STRONG REGIONAL 
LEADERS (AND DONORS) ON THE DIRECTION AND PROGRESS IN SECTORS 
SOMETIMES OUTWEIGHS THE ORGANIZATION\'S INPUT.  EVEN SADC\'S 
COMPOSITION ISN\'T FULLY SETTLED, WITH TALK OF MEMBERSHIP FOR 
THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DROC), KENYA, UGANDA, THE 
SEYCHELLES, AND MADAGASCAR SURFACING PERIODICALLY.  SADC 
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY MBUENDE RENEWED THE INVITATION TO KENYA 
AND UGANDA DURING JUNE MEETINGS WITH THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY 
OF THE REVITALIZED COMMISSION FOR EAST AFRICAN COOPERATION 
(EAC).  (NOTE: TANZANIA IS THE THIRD MEMBER OF THE EAC, AND 
ALSO A MEMBER OF SADC.  END NOTE.)  PRESIDENT MUGABE AND 
NAMIBIA\'S PRESIDENT NUJOMA HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR 
DROC\'S ADMISSION TO SADC, AND MEMBERSHIP APPLICATIONS BY THE 
DROC AND THE SEYCHELLES ARE UP FOR CONSIDERATION AT THE 
BLANTYRE SADC SUMMIT, ACCORDING TO DR. MBUENDE. 
 
22.  NEITHER KENYA NOR UGANDA IS EXPECTED TO ACCEPT SADC\'S 
INVITATION, THOUGH NEITHER HAS OFFICIALLY REFUSED THE OFFER, 
SADC\'S SENIOR ECONOMIST DR. CHUNGU MWILA TOLD POLOFF.  DR. 
MWILA PREDICTED THAT THE RESOURCE-RICH DROC WOULD JOIN SADC 
BEFORE ANY OTHER CONTENDERS, BUT ADDED THAT THE SITUATION IN 
DROC WOULD HAVE TO STABILIZE FIRST.  (COMMENT: GIVEN SADC\'S 
PRIDE IN THE STABILITY AND DEMOCRATIC COMMITMENT OF ITS 
MEMBERS, AND THE RECOGNITION THAT COORDINATING 12 COUNTRIES IS 
A CHALLENGE, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY DROC MEMBERSHIP WILL BE 
APPROVED AT THIS TIME. END COMMENT.)  IT WOULD TAKE A 
UNANIMOUS DECISION OF THE SADC SUMMIT FOR A NEW COUNTRY TO BE 
ADMITTED TO SADC, AND SOME STATES, SUCH AS BOTSWANA, WOULD 
PREFER TO SEE THE ORGANIZATION RUNNING MORE EFFECTIVELY BEFORE 
NEW MEMBERS ARE ADDED. 
 
23.  A MORE LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT SADC WILL STRENGTHEN ITS 
COOPERATION WITH OTHER REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN AFRICA, LATIN 
AMERICA, AND SOUTH EAST ASIA.  DR. MBUENDE HAS STATED THAT 
STRONGER \"SOUTH-SOUTH\" TIES WILL BOLSTER THE POSITION OF 
AFRICA WITHIN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO), GIVING 
AFRICAN COUNTRIES MORE OF A VOICE IN SETTING THE POLICIES AND 
REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THEM.  ENSURING COMPLEMENTARY AGENDAS 
IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHERE MEMBERSHIP OVERLAPS, AS IN THE 
CASE OF TANZANIA WHICH IS A MEMBER OF SADC AND THE EAC, DR. 
MBUENDE SAID FOLLOWING THE JUNE EAC MEETINGS.  HE ALSO 
RECOGNIZED THE CRITICAL ROLE REGIONAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES 
WILL PLAY IN BRINGING THE AFRICAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (AEC) TO 
LIFE.  IMPROVED RELATIONS BETWEEN SADC AND THE COMMON MARKET 
FOR EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA (COMESA), INCLUDING RECENT 
MEETINGS BETWEEN SADC\'S EXECUTIVE SECRETARY MBUENDE AND 
COMESA\'S SECRETARY-GENERAL ERASTUS MWENCHA, HAVE EASED THE 
RIVALRY THAT HAS HAMPERED COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO 
OVERLAPPING TRADE BLOCKS. 
 
 
CONSULTATION LOWERS THE LEARNING CURVE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
24.  SADC MAINTAINS REGULAR DIALOGUE WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL 
COOPERATING PARTNERS (GOVERNMENTS, NGOS) THROUGH CONSULTATIVE 
CONFERENCES AT WHICH PROGRAMS AND RESULTS ARE EVALUATED AND 
FUTURE PLANS ARE DISCUSSED.  BY INVOLVING A BROAD RANGE OF 
INTERESTED PARTIES IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING PROTOCOLS AND 
POLICIES, SADC HAS TRIED TO BREAK DOWN THE PREJUDICES OF 
GOVERNMENTS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND BUILD TRUST IN THE 
REGIONAL INTEGRATION CONCEPT.  THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
DISPARITIES AMONG SADC STATES FREQUENTLY TEST THE PRINCIPLES 
OF BALANCE, EQUITY AND MUTUAL BENEFIT WHICH UNDERLIE SADC\'S 
MAJOR POLICY GUIDELINES. 
 
25.  ONE WAY TO BRIDGE THE GAP IS BY FINDING COMMON GROUND IN 
THE NATIONAL POLICIES AND PLANS OF MEMBER STATES.  IDENTIFYING 
WHERE COUNTRIES CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER AND WORKING TO 
HARMONIZE DEVELOPING POLICIES, SADC HAS SOUGHT TO PROMOTE A 
REGIONAL AGENDA.  TELECOMMUNICATIONS, IN PARTICULAR, IS A 
SECTOR WHERE SADC STATES, AT VARYING STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, 
HAVE BENEFITED FROM LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER\'S SUCCESSES AND 
FAILURES.  IN THE NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FIELD, 
BOTSWANA\'S PROGRESSIVE TECHNIQUES HAVE SET AN EXAMPLE THAT 
OTHER SADC STATES CAN ADOPT AND ADAPT.  BY SEEKING REGIONAL 
SOLUTIONS TO WHAT INITIALLY APPEAR TO BE NATIONAL PROBLEMS, 
SADC STATES ARE IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF 
SADC PROGRAMS, AND REDUCING THE CHANCES FOR CROSS-BORDER 
CONFLICTS.  TENSIONS BETWEEN BOTSWANA AND NAMIBIA OVER A 
VETERINARY FENCE CONSTRUCTED BY BOTSWANA ALONG ITS NORTHERN 
BORDER EASED AFTER SADC\'S EXECUTIVE SECRETARY (ALONG WITH 
OTHERS) URGED BOTH SIDES TO FIND A SOLUTION.  ONE POSSIBILITY 
UNDER DISCUSSION IS A TRANS-BORDER PARK TO PRESERVE WILDLIFE 
MIGRATION ROUTES AND PROTECT COMMUNITY-BASED NATURAL RESOURCE 
MANAGEMENT PROJECTS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
26.  THE SADC TREATY REQUIRES THAT STRONG MEMBERS ASSIST 
WEAKER STATES, AN OBLIGATION THAT IN PRACTICE SOMETIMES 
TRANSLATES INTO STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE THE INTERESTS OF 
DOMINANT MEMBERS.  SACRIFICING SOVEREIGNTY FOR REGIONAL 
DECISION-MAKING REQUIRES A FLEXIBILITY THAT NOT ALL SADC 
COUNTRIES POSSESS...OR CAN AFFORD.  THE NAMIBIAN TRADE AND 
INDUSTRY MINISTER\'S RECENTLY REPORTED COMMENTS THAT SOUTH 
AFRICA, RESPONDING TO DOMESTIC PRESSURES, HAS DELIBERATELY 
HAMPERED ITS NEIGHBORS\' INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO 
PROTECT SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESSES SUGGEST THAT FORGING REGIONAL 
COOPERATION WILL BE AS CHALLENGING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AS IN 
EUROPE OR NORTH AMERICA.   WITH SADC MEMBER STATES PROGRESSING 
AT DIFFERENT PACES AND STRUGGLING WITH DIFFERENT 
DISADVANTAGES, IT WILL TAKE A FIRM COMMITMENT BY ALL 12 
MEMBERS, PARTICULARLY SOUTH AFRICA, TO PROVE THAT, ACTING 
TOGETHER, SADC COUNTRIES WILL BE BETTER OFF THAN IF THEY ACT 
ALONE.

TAGS: PREL, SADC, MZ, ZU 
SUBJECT: THE NEW LOOK OF SADC--PRESIDENCY PLANS 
AMBITIOUS RESTRUCTURING 
 
REF:  GABORONE 4211 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DCM SCOTT DELISI.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY.  THE SECRETARY\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE 
TO SADC TRAVELED OCTOBER 11-13 TO MOZAMBIQUE TO CONSULT 
WITH GOM OFFICIALS ON SADC MATTERS AND PARTICULARLY ON 
MOZAMBIQUE\'S ROLE AS CURRENT SADC PRESIDENT.  FONMIN 
SIMAO AND OTHER GOM OFFICIALS SHARED THEIR AMBITIOUS 
PLANS FOR RESTRUCTURING THE ORGANIZATION.  THEY WERE 
DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF USG ENGAGEMENT WITH SADC AND 
RESPONSIVE TO OUR CONCERNS THAT RESTRUCTURING NOT LEAD 
TO A LESS ACCESSIBLE OR LESS EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION. 
THE MINISTER MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE SADC SUMMIT\'S RECENT 
DISMISSAL OF THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY (REFTEL) DOES NOT 
NECESSARILY PRESAGE AN EFFORT TO PARE BACK THE ROLE OF 
THE SECRETARIAT (AS INITIALLY FEARED).  TO THE CONTRARY, 
HE SUGGESTED TO US THAT THE SECRETARIAT AND ITS NEW 
(YET-TO-BE-APPOINTED) SENIOR EXECUTIVE COULD ULTIMATELY 
BE GIVEN BROADER POWERS THAN THOSE THEY CURRENTLY HOLD. 
THE GOM IS PROCEEDING SYTEMATICALLY WITH ITS APPROACH TO 
RESTRUCTURING AND IS CONSULTING CLOSELY WITH REGIONAL 
PARTNERS AND WITH THE SADC SECRETARIAT.  THE PROCESS 
WILL LIKELY BE A LONGER, AND MORE DIFFICULT, ONE THAN 
THE GOM ANTICIPATES.  NONETHELESS, IF THE MOZAMBICAN 
PRESIDENCY CAN SEE ITS AMBITIOUS AGENDA THROUGH TO A 
CONCLUSION--AND CONVINCE OTHER MEMBER STATES TO SHARE 
ITS VISION--THE END RESULT COULD WELL PRODUCE A MORE 
FOCUSED AND EFFECTIVE INSTITUTION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  AMBASSADOR ROBERT KRUEGER, US AMBASSADOR TO 
BOTSWANA AND THE SECRETARY\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO 
THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC), 
ACCOMPANIED BY EMBASSY GABORONE DCM SCOTT DELISI, 
TRAVELED TO MOZAMBIQUE OCTOBER 11-13.  THERE THEY JOINED 
AMBASSADOR DEAN CURRAN, EMBASSY MAPUTO DCM ROBERT LOFTIS 
AND POLOFF FERGUSON-AUGUSTUS, FOR A SERIES OF MEETINGS 
WITH SENIOR GOM OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS A RANGE OF SADC- 
RELATED ISSUES.  EMBASSY MAPUTO WILL REPORT SEPARATELY 
ON MOZAMBIQUE\'S VIEWS ON THE TRADE PROTOCOL AND ON 
FONMIN SIMAO\'S COMMENTS ON THE CONFLICT IN THE DROC AND 
MOZAMBIQUE\'S ROLE--AS NEW PRESIDENT OF SADC--IN TRYING 
TO RESOLVE THAT CONFLICT.  IN MEETINGS WITH SIMAO, 
HOWEVER, AND WITH MFA DIRECTOR FOR MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC 
COOPERATION AND SADC NATIONAL POINT OF CONTACT BELMIRO 
MALATE, WE OBTAINED A CLEARER PICTURE OF MOZAMBIQUE\'S 
VISION FOR A RESTRUCTURED SADC AND OF THE PROCESS 
THROUGH WHICH THIS MIGHT BE ACHIEVED. 
 
3.  (C)  AS A STARTING POINT, BOTH SIMAO AND MALATE 
MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE RESTRUCTURING WOULD TAKE A BROAD- 
BASED LOOK AT SADC, AND WOULD BEGIN WITH A RESTRUCTURING 
OF THE INSTITUTION\'S AGENDA ITSELF.  MALATE NOTED THAT 
TO THIS POINT SADC HAS FOCUSED ON A RANGE OF DIFFERENT 
SECTORAL ACTIVITIES (E.G. ENVIRONMENT, AGRICULTURE, 
TOURISM, ETC.) WHICH HAD NEITHER VISIBLE 
INTERCONNECTIVITY NOR ANY MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE GOALS. 
SADC MEMBER STATES, HE ARGUED, MUST FIRST AGREE UPON AN 
IDENTIFIED SET OF PRIORITY GOALS AND THEN REASSESS 
ACTIVITIES IN EACH SECTOR TO ENSURE THAT SECTORAL 
PROGRAMS SUPPORTED AND ADVANCED THE BROADER 
INSTITUTIONAL GOALS. 
 
4.  (C)  THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THE GOM WAS 
PREPARING A PAPER FOR DISCUSSION BY MEMBER STATES WHICH 
COULD LEAD TO DEFINITION OF SADC\'S NEW AGENDA AND GOALS. 
THE SECRETARIAT IN GABORONE REPORTS AS WELL THAT IT HAS 
BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE GOM, PROVIDING VARIOUS 
POSITION PAPERS ON SADC STRUCTURAL ISSUES.  ALTHOUGH THE 
SECRETARIAT REMAINS CAUTIOUS GIVEN THAT ITS PREVIOUS 
RECOMMENDATIONS ON RESTRUCTURING WERE REJECTED BY THE 
SADC SUMMIT IN MAURITIUS IN SEPTEMBER 1998 IT HAS 
APPARENTLY OFFERED THE PRESIDENCY SOME OF THE SAME 
PROPOSALS FOR A MORE TIGHTLY STRUCTURED ORGANIZATION. 
ACCORDING TO FOREIGN MINISTER SIMAO, THE DISTRIBUTION OF 
THE PAPER WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A \"SEMINAR\" AT WHICH 
MEMBER STATES WILL JOIN WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF REGIONAL 
THINK TANKS, DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS, AND OTHERS TO DISCUSS 
THE ALTERNATIVES FOR THE RESTRUCTURED SADC. 
 
5.  (C)  BOTH SIMAO AND MALATE WERE RESPONSIVE TO OUR 
CONCERNS THAT IN THE PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING SADC NOT 
LOSE ITS INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY.  THERE MUST, WE 
COMMENTED, BE AN INSTITUTIONAL ENTITY CAPABLE OF 
REPRESENTING SADC EFFECTIVELY IN ITS INTERACTIONS WITH 
DONORS, INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND 
OTHERS.  MOREOVER, WE URGED THAT RESTRUCTURING ALSO TAKE 
INTO ACCOUNT THE NEED FOR CLEARLY DEFINED ROLES FOR THE 
SECRETARIAT, THE PRESIDENCY, SECTORAL COORDINATING UNITS 
AND MEMBER STATES AND ESTABLISHED LINES OF AUTHORITY 
BETWEEN THEM.  SIMAO AGREED, NOTING THAT THE CHALLENGE 
HAS BEEN IN PART THAT THE MEMBER STATES HAVE NO PREVIOUS 
EXPERIENCE OF THIS SORT OF PARTNERSHIP WITH EACH OTHER 
OR WITH OUTSIDERS.  AT PRESENT, HE URGED US TO CONTINUE 
OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH SADC ACROSS AS BROAD A FRONT AS 
POSSIBLE--WITH THE SECRETARIAT, WITH HIM AS CHAIRMAN OF 
THE COUNCIL OF THE MINISTERS, AND WITH SECTORAL 
COORDINATORS.  HE ADVISED THAT WE \"KEEP LOOSE\" AND NOT 
FIX RIGID APPROACHES TO SADC AT PRESENT BUT PROMISED 
THAT A DEFINED STRUCTURE WAS COMING. 
 
6.  (C)  IN REASSESSING SADC\'S STRUCTURE ALONG WITH ITS 
AGENDA SIMAO AND MALATE BOTH HINTED THAT THEY ENVISIONED 
A STRONGER SECRETARIAT, POSSIBLY CREATING A SECRETARY 
GENERAL POSITION TO REPLACE THE RECENTLY DISMISSED 
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY.  SIMAO NOTED THAT ORIGINALLY SADC 
MEMBER STATES HAD WANTED TO AVOID CREATION OF A LARGE 
SECRETARIAT WITH A POTENTIALLY COSTLY BUREAUCRACY THAT 
WOULD DRAIN FUNDS AWAY FROM DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. 
EQUALLY, HE ACKNOWLEDGED, MEMBER STATES FEARED AN OVERLY 
STRONG SECRETARIAT WOULD REDUCE THE ROLE FOR MEMBER 
STATES.  NOW, HOWEVER, HE SAID SADC MUST RE-EXAMINE THE 
QUESTION OF THE LEVEL OF EMPOWERMENT OF THE SECRETARIAT. 
MALATE HAD ALSO OBSERVED EARLIER IN THE DAY THAT IN THE 
PROCESS SADC MUST ALSO MORE CLEARLY ADDRESS THE 
INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE SECRETARIAT AND THE 
PRESIDENCY.  HE FELT THAT CLOSER TIES WERE NEEDED AND 
NOTED THAT UNDER THE GOM THE PRESIDENCY WAS ALREADY MORE 
CLOSELY ENGAGED WITH THE SECRETARIAT. 
 
7.  (C)  A SIMILAR PROCESS OF REDEFINITION WILL CONTINUE 
WITH THE ORGAN FOR POLITICS, DEFENSE AND SECURITY, THE 
CHAIRMANSHIP OF WHICH IS CURRENTLY HELD BY ZIMBABWE. 
AS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY EMBASSY MBABANE, 
MALATE NOTED THAT THE MEETING OF THE INTERSTATE DEFENSE 
AND SECURITY COMMITTEE IN MBABANE AT THE END OF THE 
MONTH WOULD HOPEFULLY LEAD TO A MORE PRECISELY DEFINED 
ROLE FOR THE ORGAN AND GREATER CLARITY CONCERNING ITS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENCY.  MALATE NOTED THAT THE 
MEETING WOULD LIKELY BE BROADER THAN THE NORMAL ISDSC 
GATHERINGS AND WOULD INCLUDE NOT ONLY MILITARY CHIEFS 
AND DEFENSE MINISTERS BUT REPRESENTATIVES FROM FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS, INTERIOR, OR OTHER NATIONAL MINISTRIES DEALING 
WITH POLITICAL, DEFENSE OR SECURITY ISSUES.  HE HOPED 
THAT THE DISCUSSIONS MIGHT LEAD TO A RESTRUCTURING OF 
THE AGENDA FOR THE ORGAN SIMILAR TO THAT PLANNED FOR 
SADC AS A WHOLE.  HE NOTED THAT A SOUTH AFRICAN NGO, 
ACCORD, HAD BEEN SELECTED TO CONDUCT A SEMINAR TO LOOK 
MORE CLOSELY AT THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE ORGAN. 
 
8.  (C)  SIMAO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE RESTRUCTURING 
PROCESS WOULD BE TIME CONSUMING AND MIGHT NOT BE FULLY 
COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE END OF MOZAMBIQUE\'S ONE YEAR IN 
THE PRESIDENCY (OF WHICH 10 MONTHS REMAIN).  ALMOST 
CERTAINLY, THE PROCESS WILL NOT BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE 
6-MONTH TIMEFRAME MANDATED BY THE MAPUTO SUMMIT IN 
AUGUST.  SIMAO HOPED, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD BE 
SUFFICIENTLY WELL LAUNCHED THAT MOZAMBIQUE\'S SUCCESSOR 
IN THE PRESIDENCY, NAMIBIA, WOULD BRING IT TO A 
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION IF NECESSARY.  HE INFORMED US, 
HOWEVER, THAT IN THE INTERIM, HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE 
PROCEEDING WITH EFFORTS TO SELECT A NEW SENIOR EXECUTIVE 
FOR SADC.  HE THOUGHT THAT THE ACTING EXECUTIVE 
SECRETARY, DR. PREGA RAMSAMY, WOULD LIKELY BE LEFT IN 
THAT ROLE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS BOTH SADC\'S AGENDA AND THE 
ROLE OF THE SECRETARIAT AND ITS LEADERSHIP HAD BEEN 
FULLY REVIEWED. 
 
9.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE APPROACH PROPOSED BY SIMAO AND 
MALATE REFLECTS THE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND 
SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE WITH WHICH THEY TAKE MOZAMBIQUE\'S 
ROLE AS SADC\'S PRESIDENT.  HOWEVER, WHILE OTHER MEMBER 
STATES AGREE THAT STRUCTURAL REFORM OF SADC IS 
NECESSARY, WHETHER THEY WILL ALSO ULTIMATELY SHARE 
MOZAMBIQUE\'S VISION OF WHAT FORM THAT REFORM SHOULD TAKE 
REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  MEANWHILE, THE PROCESS OUTLINED BY 
SIMAO WILL LIKELY BE TIME CONSUMING, POTENTIALLY COSTLY, 
AND MORE EASILY CONCEPTUALIZED THAN IMPLEMENTED. 
MOZAMBIQUE, AS SADC PRESIDENT, MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO 
MARSHALL THE RESOURCES TO OVERCOME THE BUREAUCRATIC 
HURDLES AND LOGISTICAL LOGJAMS THAT WILL ACCOMPANY THIS 
EFFORT TO ENSURE A BROAD POLICY DIALOGUE.  WE WILL WANT 
TO SUPPORT THE PROCESS AS BEST WE CAN IN HOPES THAT SADC 
WILL EMERGE A MORE FOCUSED AND MORE EFFECTIVE 
INSTITUTION.  THE REAL WORK, HOWEVER, WILL REST WITH THE 
SADC MEMBER STATES.  WE HOPE THEY ARE UP TO THE TASK.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  IN THE PAST YEAR SOUTHERN AFRICA HAS WITNESSED A 
SERIES OF ELECTIONS.  SOME, SUCH AS THOSE IN MOZAMBIQUE, 
ZIMBABWE, AND TANZANIA, HAVE BEEN HOTLY CONTESTED IN SOME 
AREAS, WITH QUESTIONS RAISED AS TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE 
ELECTORAL PROCESS.  OTHERS, SUCH AS THOSE IN BOTSWANA, 
NAMIBIA, AND MAURITIUS, HAVE BEEN GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS 
MODELS OF ELECTORAL LEGITIMACY.  THE ATTENTION GIVEN TO 
THESE ELECTIONS, COUPLED WITH THE EMERGENCE OF 
SIGNIFICANT PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITIONS IN SEVERAL 
COUNTRIES, HAS GIVEN RISE TO A NUMBER OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN- 
LED INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE MULTI-PARTYISM AND DEMOCRATIC 
PERFORMANCE IN THE REGION.  THIS PROVIDES US A UNIQUE AND 
TIMELY OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THESE DEVELOPMENTS.  WE 
RECOMMEND DOING SO, AND PROPOSE THAT THE DEPARTMENT 
ALLOCATE $250,000 IN FY01 ESF TO HELP ESTABLISH A 
PERMANENT CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE OF POLITICAL PARTIES 
AND TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A 
POLITICAL PARTY TRAINING INSTITUTE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2.  OUR REQUEST FOLLOWS THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE 
\"ENGINEERING DEMOCRATIC CHANGE: THE EXPERIENCE OF 
POLITICAL PARTIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA\" CONFERENCE HELD 
SEPTEMBER 28-30 IN WINDHOEK USING FY00 ESF (REF C).  THE 
CONFERENCE WAS ORGANIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF NAMIBIA, 
THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WESTERN CAPE, AND THE NATIONAL 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 
(UNAM/UWC/NDI GROUP), AND WAS ATTENDED BY POLITICAL PARTY 
LEADERS FROM GOVERNING AND OPPOSITION PARTIES AROUND THE 
REGION.  THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS ISSUED AN EIGHT- 
POINT CONSENSUS DOCUMENT THAT OUTLINES THEIR DECISION TO 
FORM A CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN 
SOUTHERN AFRICA (CCPP) AND TO EXPLORE THE IDEA OF FORMING 
A REGIONAL POLITICAL PARTY TRAINING INSTITUTE.  THE 
PARTICIPANTS ALSO PROPOSED THAT THE UNAM/UWC/NDI GROUP 
ORGANIZE A MEETING IN MARCH 2001 TO OFFICIALLY LAUNCH THE 
CCPP AND THE INSTITUTE.  BOTH INITIATIVES WILL EMBRACE 
GOVERNING AND OPPOSITION PARTY LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE 
IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM, WITH THE AIM OF IMPROVING POLITICAL 
PARTIES\' ABILITY TO FUNCTION AS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. 
 
------------ 
OUR PROPOSAL 
------------ 
 
3.   USAID\'S REGIONAL CENTER FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA (RCSA) 
PARTICIPATED IN FOLLOW-ON MEETINGS WITH THE UNAM/UWC/NDI 
GROUP IN CAPE TOWN ON OCTOBER 18 AND WITH UNAM IN 
GABORONE ON OCTOBER 27.  THESE MEETINGS REAFFIRMED THE 
GROUP\'S RESOLVE TO CARRY THE PROCESS THROUGH TO THE MARCH 
2001 MEETING AND BEYOND.  WE WOULD LIKE TO BUILD ON OUR 
INITIAL ESF INVESTMENT IN THIS PROCESS AND ENCOURAGE THIS 
INITIATIVE OF POLITICAL PARTIES FROM THROUGHOUT THE SADC 
REGION BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ESF FUNDING IN SUPPORT OF 
THESE EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN REGIONAL DEMOCRATIC 
PERFORMANCE.  WE PROPOSE THAT THE DEPARTMENT ALLOCATE 
$250,000 IN FY01 ESF TO ALLOW RCSA TO: 
 
-- SUPPORT THE MARCH 2001 MEETING; 
 
-- ASSIST IN ESTABLISHING THE CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE OF 
POLITICAL PARTIES THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE FORMALIZED AT 
THAT MEETING; AND 
 
-- INVESTIGATE MECHANISMS FOR ESTABLISHING SUSTAINABLE 
TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLITICAL 
PARTY LEADERS. 
 
4.  OF THIS AMOUNT, WE PROPOSE THAT APPROXIMATELY 
$100,000 BE USED TO SUPPORT PREPARING AND CONVENING THE 
MARCH 2001 MEETING, $100,000 TO HELP TO ESTABLISH THE 
CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE, AND $50,000 TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH THE TRAINING INSTITUTE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  THE UNAM/UWC/NDI GROUP\'S INITIATIVE COMES AT AN 
IMPORTANT INTER-ELECTION PERIOD, WHEN ROLES AND 
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GOVERNING AND OPPOSITION PARTIES 
WILL BE FORMULATED AND CONSOLIDATED, AND CAN EVOLVE INTO 
INFLUENTIAL, POSITIVE CODES OF CONDUCT FOR POLITICAL 
PARTY ACTION DURING THE NEXT ROUND OF ELECTIONS.  THIS 
INITIATIVE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD IN 
PROMOTING DEMOCRATIC NORMS FOR POLITICAL BEHAVIOR IN 
SOUTHERN AFRICA.  IN OUR VIEW, THE INITIATIVE HAS THE 
POTENTIAL TO AMELIORATE DISCORD CAUSED BY A \"WINNER-TAKE- 
ALL\" MENTALITY AND TO DEMONSTRATE REAL POLITICAL WILL BY 
THE REGION\'S PARTY LEADERS TO WORK TOGETHER FOR THE 
PUBLIC INTEREST.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  SADC FOREIGN AND DEFENSE MINISTERS HAVE REACHED 
CONSENSUS ON REFORMING THE LONG-MORIBUND SADC ORGAN ON 
POLITICS, DEFENSE AND SECURITY, FM MERAFHE TOLD US.  THE 
ORGAN HAS BEEN LARGELY DYSFUNCTIONAL SINCE ITS CREATION 
IN 1996, DUE TO A DISPUTE OVER LINES OF AUTHORITY 
BETWEEN IT AND SADC PROPER THAT PITTED ORGAN CHAIRMAN 
ROBERT MUGABE AGAINST 1996-99 SADC CHAIRMAN NELSON 
MANDELA.  ACCORDING TO MERAFHE, THE SADC FOREIGNQ 
MINISTERS MET IN HARARE NOVEMBER 23 AND AGREED ON A 
REFORM PLAN THAT CLEARLY SUBORDINATES THE ORGAN TO THE 
SADC CHAIRMAN AND ESTABLISHES A TROIKA CHAIRMANSHIP OF 
THE ORGAN.  THIS AGREEMENT WAS ACHIEVED ONLY AFTER 
CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE WAS PUT ON ZIMBABWE, WHICH HAD 
LONG OPPOSED THE REFORM PLAN, MERAFHE SAID.  SADC HEADS 
OF STATE MUST NOW RATIFY THE PLAN, WHICH MERAFHE EXPECTS 
TO HAPPEN AT AN EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT WITHIN THE NEXT SIX 
MONTHS.  THIS REFORM, IF RATIFIED, WOULD BE A CLEAR STEP 
FORWARD IN SADC\'S EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A SOUND REGIONAL 
SECURITY ARCHITECTURE.  HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ORGAN WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON THE 
EXTENT TO WHICH SADC\'S DIVERSE MEMBERS CAN DEVELOP A 
COMMON SET OF VALUES IN THEIR APPROACH TO CONFLICT 
MANAGEMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
SADC MINISTERS AGREE TO REFORM POLITICAL/SECURITY ORGAN 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
2. (C)  FOREIGN MINISTER MERAFHE TOLD AMBASSADOR 
NOVEMBER 24 THAT AN IMPORTANT NEW DEVELOPMENT HAD 
OCCURRED DURING HIS MEETING THE DAY BEFORE WITH A 
GROUPING OF OTHER SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY 
(SADC) FOREIGN AND DEFENSE MINISTERS IN HARARE.  THE 
MINISTERS PRESENT (FROM AT LEAST 10 OF THE 14 MEMBER 
STATES -- MAURITIUS, ZAMBIA, SEYCHELLES, AND POSSIBLY 
DRC WERE NOT PRESENT) REACHED CONSENSUS ON A PLAN FOR 
REFORMING THE STRUCTURE OF SADC\'S ORGAN FOR POLITICS, 
DEFENSE AND SECURITY.  THE PLAN FOLLOWED THE OUTLINE OF 
THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY SADC FOREIGN AND DEFENSE 
MINISTERS IN MBABANE IN OCTOBER 1999:  THAT THE ORGAN IS 
INDEED A PART OF SADC AND SHOULD REPORT TO THE SADC 
CHAIRMAN; AND THAT THE ORGAN\'S CHAIRMANSHIP (HELD BY 
MUGABE SINCE THE ORGAN\'S CREATION IN 1996) SHOULD BE 
TRANSFORMED INTO AN ANNUALLY ROTATING TROIKA.  (COMMENT: 
ZIMBABWE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD SIGNED ON TO THE MBABANE 
COMMUNIQUE, BUT SUBSEQUENT BACKSLIDING THREW THE ORGAN 
REFORM ISSUE INTO QUESTION.  SEE REFTELS.  END COMMENT). 
 
3. (C)  THE HARARE CONSENSUS, PROVIDED IT HOLDS, WOULD 
OPEN THE DOOR TO CLEARING UP A PROBLEM THAT HAS 
BEDEVILED SADC FOR FOUR YEARS.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE 
ORGAN HAS HAD A DYSFUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH SADC 
ITSELF.  THE CRUX OF THE MATTER HAS BEEN SHARP 
DISAGREEMENT OVER WHETHER THE ORGAN SHOULD BE 
SUBORDINATE TO THE SADC CHAIRMAN OR AUTONOMOUS FROM IT. 
THIS DISPUTE LARGELY PITTED ORGAN CHAIRMAN ROBERT MUGABE 
AGAINST NELSON MANDELA, WHO HELD THE SADC CHAIRMANSHIP 
FROM 1996-99.  THE MOST WELL KNOW CONTROVERSY 
SURROUNDING THE ORGAN WAS THE UNRESOLVED DEBATE OVER 
WHETHER THE ORGAN (OR FOR THAT MATTER, SADC ITSELF) EVER 
FORMALLY ENDORSED THE DEPLOYMENT OF ZIMBABWEAN, NAMIBIAN 
AND ANGOLAN TROOPS (THE SO-CALLED \"SADC FORCES\") TO THE 
DRC IN AUGUST 1998. 
 
--------------------- 
TWISTING HARARE\'S ARM 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C)  MERAFHE SINGLED OUT ZIMBABWE AS THE MAIN 
STUMBLING BLOCK AT THE HARARE MINISTERIAL.  HE SAID 
ZIMBABWE WAS RELUCTANT TO GO ALONG WITH THE REFORM PLAN 
UNTIL HE, ALONG WITH SOUTH AFRICAN FM ZUMA, \"HAMMERED\" 
AWAY AT ZIMBABWEAN FM MUDENGE UNTIL \"HE WAS DISABUSED OF 
HIS NOTIONS.\"  MERAFHE (PROTECT) FURTHER NOTED THAT HE, 
ALONG WITH THE OTHER MINISTERS WHO WERE PRESENT, ARE NOW 
\"QUIETLY CELEBRATING\" ZIMBABWE\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE 
STRUCTURAL CHANGE. 
 
5. (C)  ACCORDING TO MERAFHE, THE SADC HEADS OF STATE 
MUST NOW RATIFY THE PLAN BEFORE IT BECOMES OPERABLE.  HE 
ANTICIPATES THIS WILL HAPPEN AT AN EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT 
WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.  ASKED BY THE AMBASSADOR 
ABOUT THE CHANCES OF FURTHER BACKSLIDING AT THE HEAD OF 
STATE LEVEL, MERAFHE REPLIED THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY 
DIFFICULT -- AND DOWNRIGHT EMBARRASSING -- FOR ZIMBABWE 
OR ANY OTHER MEMBER STATE TO BREAK RANKS AT THIS POINT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
SADC CONSENSUS ON ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING, TOO? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6. (C)  WE ASKED MERAFHE ABOUT THE \"OTHER HALF\" OF 
SADC\'S RESTRUCTURING EFFORT -- A REVIEW THAT BEGAN 15 
MONTHS AGO OF SADC\'S HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED (AND WIDELY 
CRITICIZED) SYSTEM OF 21 SECTOR COORDINATING UNITS, EACH 
(WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS) FUNDED AND STAFFED BY A SINGLE 
MEMBER STATE.  HE REPORTED THAT THE ISSUE WOULD BE 
DISCUSSED BY THE SADC COUNCIL OF MINISTERS (OF WHICH 
MERAFHE IS A MEMBER) AT THEIR NOVEMBER 28 MEETING IN 
GABORONE, AND THAT HE EXPECTED A FAVORABLE AND NON- 
CONTROVERSIAL OUTCOME.  (COMMENT:  THIS TRACKS WITH WHAT 
WE ARE HEARING FROM A VARIETY OF OTHER SOURCES:  THAT 
AFTER 15 MONTHS OF STUDY AND NEGOTIATIONS, SADC HAS 
REACHED A CONSENSUS TO CONSOLIDATE THE 21 SECTOR UNITS 
INTO 4 \"CLUSTERS\" -- TRADE/FINANCE/INVESTMENT; 
INFRASTRUCTURE; AGRICULTURE/ENVIRONMENT; AND HUMAN 
RESOURCES -- THAT WOULD BE REGIONALLY FUNDED AND 
REGIONALLY STAFFED.  END COMMENT). 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C)  SHOULD THE CONSENSUS REACHED IN HARARE STICK, 
THIS CAN ONLY BE SEEN AS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR 
SADC.  HAVING A FUNCTIONING ORGAN WOULD GIVE SADC A 
MUCH-NEEDED MECHANISM FOR ADDRESSING REGIONAL SECURITY 
ISSUES, AS WELL AS GIVE THE U.S. AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL 
PARTNERS A POINT OF CONTACT THROUGH WHICH TO ENGAGE SADC 
ON SUCH ISSUES.  AT THE SAME TIME, AT THIS POINT IT 
WOULD NOT BE PRUDENT AUTOMATICALLY TO ASSUME SADC WILL 
ACTUALLY APPROVE THESE REFORMS -- PRESIDENT MUGABE COULD 
STILL BLOCK THEM IF HE SO CHOOSES.  NOR WOULD IT BE 
PRUDENT TO OVERSELL THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A REFORMED 
ORGAN.  MANY OBSERVERS POINT TO THE STARK DISPARITIES 
AMONG THE 14 SADC COUNTRIES REGARDING THEIR LEVEL OF 
POLITICAL MATURITY AND COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
DEMOCRACY.  UNLESS AND UNTIL THE REGION DEVELOPS A 
GREATER DEGREE OF SHARED COMMITMENT TO THESE VALUES, THE 
ULTIMATE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ORGAN AS A VEHICLE FOR 
DIPLOMATIC, NON-MILITARY APPROACHES TO REGIONAL SECURITY 
ISSUES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA WILL REMAIN IN QUESTION. 
NONETHELESS, THE HARARE CONSENSUS IS A PREREQUISITE FOR 
SADC TO GET TO THAT POINT.  THIS, COUPLED WITH THE 
ENCOURAGING NEWS SUGGESTING AGREEMENT ON CONSOLIDATING 
SADC\'S FAR-FLUNG AND GENERALLY WEAK DEVELOPMENTAL 
STRUCTURES, APPEARS TO BODE WELL FOR SADC\'S LONG-TERM 
ASPIRATIONS TO BECOME A STRONGER ENGINE FOR REGIONAL 
INTEGRATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.

IT WAS WITH GREAT SHOCK AND SADNESS THAT I LEARNED OF 
THE HORRIFIC TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE TWIN WORLD

SEPTEMBER 2001, RESULTING IN THE TRAGIC DEMISE OF

REF:  A) STATE 169975 B) STATE 175419 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DCM LESLIE BASSETT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STATEMENTS BY THE GOB 
TO DATE HAVE BEEN FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF USG ACTIONS AGAINST 
TALIBAN MILITARY TARGETS.  IN A 10/11 MEETING WITH THE 
AMBASSADOR,  MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY ERNEST MPOFU DEFENDED A 
MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH IN ORDER TO AVOID EXTREMIST 
RETALIATION AGAINST BOTSWANA\'S MISSIONS ABROAD, BUT 
SUBSEQUENTLY CONCEDED THAT HIS MINISTER\'S POLICY WAS TO 
SUPPORT THE USG.  MPOFU ALSO REPORTED THE CONVOCATION OF AN 
AD-HOC COMMISSION TO COORDINATE GOB ACTIONS AGAINST 
TERRORISM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
INITIAL REACTIONS FULLY SUPPORTIVE 
 
2.  (C)  ON OCTOBER 8 VP IAN KHAMA PHONED THE AMBASSADOR TO 
CONVEY HIS PERSONAL SUPPORT FOR THE COALITION EFFORT 
AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  HE APPLAUDED THE DECISION TO ACT, 
ACCEPTED INDICATIONS THAT USAMA BIN LADEN WAS THE 
PERPETRATOR, AND WISHED THE USG SUCCESS IN CARRYING OUT THE 
ENGAGEMENT.  ASKED IF HE WOULD MAKE HIS SUPPORT PUBLIC, 
HOWEVER, KHAMA DEMURRED, SUGGESTING THIS WAS AN ISSUE FOR 
THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, AND NOTING THAT BOTSWANA TENDS TO 
TAKE A LOW PROFILE.  THAT \"DOESN\'T MEAN IN ANY WAY WE\'RE 
NOT SUPPORTIVE,\" HE ADDED. 
 
3.  (U)  OCTOBER 10 PRESS QUOTED FOREIGN MINISTER MERAFHE 
OFFERING HIS COUNTRY\'S FULL SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.-LED 
STRIKES AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  HE NOTED THE ACTION WAS NOT 
PREMATURE, AS THOSE WHO HARBORED THE PERPETRATORS OF THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS HAD BEEN GIVEN AMPLE TIME TO SURRENDER 
BIN LADEN AND HIS SUPPORTERS.  MERAFHE ONCE AGAINST 
CHARACTERIZED THE SEPTEMBER 11 TRAGEDY AS AN ATTACK ON 
HUMANITY AS A WHOLE. 
 
MOVING PAST BUREAUCRATIC DOUBTS 
 
4.  (C)  ON OCTOBER 11 MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY ERNEST MPOFU 
REQUESTED A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR TO DISCUSS GOB 
RESPONSES TO THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS.  HE PROVIDED THE 
AMBASSADOR WITH THE STATEMENT WHICH HAD SERVED AS THE BASIS 
FOR MERAFHE\'S REMARKS.  THE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS DOCUMENT 
REGRETS THAT AFGHANISTAN DID NOT SURRENDER THE SUSPECTED 
PERPETRATORS, HOPES THAT USG ACTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH 
THE UN CHARTER, AND EXPRESSES THE VIEW THAT THE ATTACKS 
SHOULD BE OF MINIMAL DURATION.  MPOFU DEFENDED THE WEAK 
STATEMENT AS A NECESSARY HEDGE TO AVOID PROVOKING EXTREMIST 
GROUPS.  BOTSWANA\'S MISSIONS WORLDWIDE ARE NOT SECURE, HE 
POINTED OUT.  IN CAPE TOWN THAT DAY, MPOFU ADDED, THERE WAS 
A DEMONSTRATION AT THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSION, CO-LOCATED 
IN THE SAME BUILDING AS THE BOTSWANA MISSION.  THE GOB 
LACKS THE RESOURCES TO SECURE ITS OFFICIALS AND PREMISES; 
IT CANNOT AFFORD TO PROVOKE EXTREMIST REACTIONS. 
 
5.  (C)  PRESSED BY THE AMBASSADOR, MPOFU CONCEDED THAT THE 
WEAKER STATEMENT WAS SUPERSEDED BY THE MINISTER\'S STRONG 
SUPPORT OF THE USG STRIKES AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  THE 
AMBASSADOR STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING SUCH 
SUPPORT.  HE PROVIDED COPIES OF A LETTER HE WROTE TO 
PRESIDENT MOGAE 10/9 (AS A COVER TO PRESIDENT BUSH\'S REPLY 
TO PRESIDENT MOGAE\'S LETTER OF CONDOLENCE) WHICH URGED THE 
GOB TO REMAIN PUBLICLY SUPPORTIVE.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO 
PROVIDED THE TEXT OF HIS 10/10 STATEMENT TO THE PRESS WHICH 
ARGUED THE USG CASE AND CALLED FOR BROAD SUPPORT FROM 
BOTSWANA. 
 
FIRST COORDINATED ACTIONS FROM GOB ON TERRORISM 
 
6.  (C)  MPOFU REPORTED THAT HE HAD RECENTLY CONVOKED AN 
AD-HOC COMMISSION TO COORDINATE GOB RESPONSES TO TERRORISM 
AND ITS FULFILLMENT OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.  THE 
COMMISSION INCLUDES THE BOTSWANA DEFENSE FORCE, THE POLICE 
(INCLUDING ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENCY), CUSTOMS, IMMIGRATION, 
THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY, THE BANK OF BOTSWANA, AND THE 
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.  EACH AGENCY HAD BEEN TASKED WITH 
SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH WERE TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE NEAR 
TERM; SEVERAL SUBCOMMITTEES LOOKING AT TRANSPORTATION, 
AIRPORT ACCESS, AND FINANCIAL ISSUES WERE ALSO CREATED. 
MPOFU WAS CONFIDENT THIS MECHANISM WOULD ALLOW BOTSWANA TO 
REPORT FULL COMPLIANCE WITH UNSCR 1373 AS WELL AS ITS OTHER 
INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS.  IT WOULD ALSO IDENTIFY ANY 
LOOPHOLES THAT NEEDED TO BE FILLED.  HE OFFERED TO GIVE US 
REGULAR UPDATES ON THE COMMISSION\'S PROGRESS. 
 
COOL ON REGIONAL EFFORTS 
 
7.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR QUERIED MPOFU ABOUT POSSIBLE 
REGIONAL INITIATIVES, PERHAPS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SADC. 
MPOFU SUGGESTED THAT FINANCIAL TRACKING EFFORTS WITHIN THE 
REGION ASSUMED THAT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WERE PLENTIFUL - 
- IN FACT BOTSWANA TRANSACTED PRIMARILY WITH SOUTH AFRICA. 
HE SUGGESTED THAT SADC MIGHT BEST MOBILIZE ITSELF ON THE 
FRINGES OF AN UPCOMING MEETING OF THE AD-HOC COMMISSION ON 
UNITA SANCTIONS; THE SAME PLAYERS WOULD LIKELY DISCUSS THE 
REPERCUSSIONS OF SEPTEMBER 11. 
 
8. (C)  MPOFU ALSO NOTED THE GOB HAD RECEIVED AN INVITATION 
FOR A SUMMIT IN DAKAR NEXT WEEK TO DISCUSS TERRORISM IN 
AFRICA.  HIS VIEW WAS THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS NOT WELL- 
DEFINED, AND THE GOB WOULD LIKELY NOT ATTEND.  HE 
UNDERSTOOD OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS WERE ALSO SKEPTICAL. 
MPOFU AVERRED THAT PRESIDENT WADE\'S REAL PURPOSE WAS TO 
FOCUS ON TERRORISM INSIDE SENEGAL AND OTHER PARTS OF 
AFRICA. 
 
9.  (C)  COMMENT:  MPOFU, THE HIGHEST-RANKING CAREER 
DIPLOMAT IN THE BOTSWANA FOREIGN SERVICE, IS ALSO THE MOST 
CAUTIOUS.  IT IS DISAPPOINTING THAT THE TALKING POINTS FOR 
MINISTER MERAFHE WERE SO WEAK; IT IS HEARTENING THAT HE 
MOVED READILY PAST THEM TO FULLY SUPPORT USG ACTIONS.

SUBJECT:  MANY BATSWANA SOMEWHAT DUBIOUS ABOUT U.S. 
STRIKES 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  ENERGETIC OUTREACH EFFORTS BY THE 
AMBASSADOR AND MISSION STAFF REVEAL THAT INITIAL 
SYMPATHY FOR THE U.S. POST-SEPTEMBER 11 HAS ERODED WITH 
RECENT AIRSTRIKES AGAINST THE TALIBAN.  BATSWANA 
QUESTION U.S. FOREIGN POLICIES; COMPARE THE ASCETIC 
IMAGE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN WITH THE ARRAY OF TECHNICAL 
WEAPONS BEING AIMED AT HIM; AND TALLY THE CIVILIAN 
CASUALTIES OF STRIKES AGAINST THE TALIBAN.   THEY ASK 
FOR HARD PROOF OF BIN LADEN\'S GUILT; THEY FEAR THE 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WORLD OF A HEAD-ON CONFRONTATION 
WITH TERROR.  ULTIMATELY HOWEVER, THEY VIEW SEPTEMBER 
11 - AND TERRORISM IN GENERAL - AS SOMEONE ELSE\'S 
PROBLEM, NOT THEIRS.  OUR SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO WIN GOB 
SUPPORT COME IN THE FACE OF SOME LOCAL MEDIA WHICH 
PRESS THE GOB TO REMAIN NEUTRAL.  OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH 
LOCAL EDITORS, MUSLIM OFFICIALS, BUSINESS 
ORGANIZATIONS, AND KEY OPINION MAKERS HAVE SLOWED, BUT 
NOT STOPPED, THIS TREND.  END SUMMARY. 
 
EXPRESSIONS OF DOUBT 
 
2.  THE AMBASSADOR\'S 10/9 MEETING WITH THREE MEDIA 
EDITORS WAS ILLUSTRATIVE OF MANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS 
HELD BY MISSION STAFF.  THE THREE VOLUNTEERED THAT THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS WERE EVIL, AND IN NO WAY 
JUSTIFIED.  THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE WAVE OF SYMPATHY AND 
RESPECT FOR THE USG WHICH BEGAN TO DIMINISH AS IT 
BECAME APPARENT THE USG WOULD RESPOND WITH SIGNIFICANT 
FORCE.  THE EDITORS WERE NOT CONVINCED UBL WAS GUILTY, 
EVEN THOUGH THEY CONCEDED HE LIKELY WAS, AND SUGGESTED 
THAT THE USG SHOULD WORK HARDER TO MAKES ITS PUBLIC 
CASE.   OVERALL THE EDITORS FELT BATSWANA REACTION TO 
THE AIRSTRIKES WAS MIXED. 
 
3.  THE EDITORS ALSO QUESTIONED THE MEANS THE USG WAS 
USING TO TRY AND APPREHEND UBL.  MEDIA DEPICTED UBL AS 
AN ASCETIC (ONE EDITOR SAID \"A SAINT\") WHO HAD 
RENOUNCED AN OSTENTATIOUS LIFESTYLE TO FIGHT WARS OF 
LIBERATION.  HE WAS PHOTOGRAPHED IN ROBES IN THE 
DESERT, SOMETIMES WITH HIS FAMILY.  IT IS DIFFICULT FOR 
THE PUBLIC TO IMPUTE TO HIM THE CRIMES HE IS CHARGED 
WITH WHEN THEY ARE FACED WITH THESE IMAGES.  OPPOSITE 
THIS SIMPLE FIGURE STOOD THE ARMED MIGHT OF THE USG, 
WITH SMART BOMBS AND HIGH-TECH AIRCRAFT POISED TO 
ATTACK.  THE AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED THE UBL NETWORK OF 
ASSOCIATES, THE COMMITMENT TO TERROR, THE POSSIBLE 
STOCK MARKET MANIPULATIONS TO STRESS THAT THIS WAS NOT 
A SIMPLE MAN OR ORGANIZATION.  THE EDITORS RETURNED 
REPEATEDLY, HOWEVER, TO THE IDEA THAT THE USG WAS 
TRYING TO APPREHEND AN INDIVIDUAL BY USING 
OVERWHELMING, AND POSSIBLY INDISCRIMINATE, FORCE.  THEY 
HAD LITTLE INTEREST IN THE TALIBAN; THEY DID GIVE A 
GREAT DEAL OF WEIGHT TO CIVILIAN DEATHS CAUSED BY USG 
ATTACKS AND THE REFUGEE FLOWS OUT OF AFGHANISTAN. 
FINALLY, THEY NOTED THAT RESPONSES TO SEPTEMBER 11 
COULD GENERATE A NEW ROUND OF TERRORIST ATTACKS BY 
GROUPS NOT EVEN ASSOCIATED WITH SEPTEMBER 11 BUT NOW 
RESPONDING TO ATTACKS ON THEIR COLLEAGUES. 
 
4.  PRESSED TO OFFER BETTER ALTERNATIVES, SOME 
SUGGESTED RELYING MORE ON THE UN AND A BROADER 
COALITION EFFORT SO THAT IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE A US-ONLY 
EFFORT.  ANOTHER SUGGESTED PUBLICIZING A STRONGER CASE 
AGAINST UBL.  ALL CONCURRED THAT THE USG SHOULD 
CONSIDER OTHER, MORE DIRECTED, MEANS PROPORTIONATE TO 
ITS ENDS - JUSTICE AGAINST THE PERPETRATORS OF 
SEPTEMBER 11.  THEY ALSO SEVERAL TIMES SUGGESTED THAT 
THE U.S. WAS PERCEIVED AS A \"BULLY\" INTERNATIONALLY, 
AND THAT THE WAR ON TERRORISM LOSES GENERAL APPEAL THE 
MORE IT IS VIEWED AS PRIMARILY A U.S. EFFORT. 
 
OUTRIGHT DISAGREEMENT WITH THE USG 
 
5.  BOTSWANA MEDIA AND LETTERS TO THE EDITOR HAVE BEEN 
ON BALANCE MORE NEGATIVE THAN POSITIVE ABOUT THE US. 
USING LOCAL AUTHORS AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL PRESS 
SERVICE PIECES, THE PRIVATE PRESS HAS ARGUED THAT THE 
U.S.\'S UNILATERAL APPROACH TO DIPLOMACY AND ITS MIDDLE 
EAST POLICIES CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS. 
PRESS HAS ALSO REPORTED CONCERN THAT U.S.-LED ATTACKS 
MAY PROMPT RETALIATIONS.  ONE PAPER EXTENSIVELY 
REPORTED ON A TRAVELLING AMERICAN FAMILY\'S BELIEF THAT 
RECENT U.S. ACTIONS WERE IN ERROR; THE PIECE RAN 
IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE AMBASSADOR\'S OP-ED ON WHY 
BOTSWANA SHOULD SUPPORT THE U.S.  LETTERS HAVE ALSO 
CRITICIZED THE GOB FOR CHOOSING TO SIDE WITH THE U.S. 
IN NO CASE, HOWEVER, HAVE MEDIA ADVOCATED ACTIONS 
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, ITS CITIZENS OR 
INSTALLATIONS. 
 
6.  AMBASSADOR, POL/ECON CHIEF AND OTHERS HAVE 
EXTENSIVELY ENGAGED THE ONLY HUMAN RIGHTS NGO IN 
GABORONE, DITSHWANELO, ON BOTH THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS 
AND THE OCTOBER 8 STRIKES.  ALICE MOGWE, THE 
ORGANIZATION\'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HAS CONSISTENTLY 
ARGUED THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTION OF THE 
GUILTY WAS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE MEANS OF RESPONSE TO THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 ATROCITIES.  HER ORGANIZATION\'S VIEWS HAVE 
ALSO BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA. 
 
AND SUPPORT FOR OUR APPROACH 
 
7.  BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL SECTORS HAVE BEEN MORE 
SUPPORTIVE.  BUSINESS TRAVELLERS RETURNING TO BOTSWANA 
RECOUNT NEW RESTRICTIONS AT AIRPORTS, AND CLOSE CALLS 
BY FAMILY OR COLLEAGUES, ANECDOTES WHICH BRING THE 
REALITY OF SEPTEMBER 11 CLOSER TO HOME.  AFTER THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S 10/12 SPEECH TO THE ROTARY CLUB, 
PARTICIPANTS WERE MORE WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT TERRORISM 
COULD TAKE PLACE IN BOTSWANA AND THAT THE GLOBAL 
COALITION ON TERRORISM MUST SUCCEED.  THEY WERE ALSO 
CURIOUS TO LEARN WHETHER THE USG WOULD SHIFT SOME OF 
ITS MIDDLE EAST POLICIES AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACKS. 
AMBASSADOR\'S AND PAO\'S CONTACTS WITH ACADEMICS ALSO 
ENCOUNTER A GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE VIEW. 
 
8.  COMMENT:   PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POST- 
OCTOBER 8 HAS GENERALLY COME FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND 
ELITES; WE SUSPECT THERE IS MORE UNSTATED POPULAR 
SUPPORT THAN REGISTERS IN THE PRESS.  WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO TARGET OUTREACH PROGRAMS AT THAT BROADER BUT LESS- 
DEFINED SPECTRUM OF BATSWANA WHO HARBOR CONTINUED 
DOUBTS ABOUT UBL GUILT, USG RESPONSE AND QUESTION THE 
RELEVANCE OF SEPTEMBER 11 TO BOTSWANA.

2.  (C) THE MEDIA.  AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE NO 
MEDIA OUTLETS WITH A RADICAL ISLAMIC EDITORIAL POLICY. 
HOWEVER, WE HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED OF THE EXISTENCE OF 
THE MUSLIM\'S CRESCENT NEWSPAPER, PURPORTEDLY EDITED BY A 
MR. ZAFAR BANGASH.  THE PUBLICATION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN 
GENERAL CIRCULATION, AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT ANYWHERE IN 
GABORONE OR FRANCISTOWN.  ACCORDING TO A REPORT IN THE 
WEEKLY PAPER THE BOTSWANA GUARDIAN, MR. BANGASH RECENTLY 
DELIVERED A LECTURE AT THE GABORONE MAIN MOSQUE URGING 
ALL BOTSWANA\'S MUSLIMS \"TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH 
AFGHANISTAN.\"  (COMMENT:  WE WILL PRESS FURTHER TO FIND

GUARDIAN IS ONE OF THE MORE SENSATIONALISTIC PAPERS IN

3.  (C) ISLAMIC PREACHING/TEACHING.  TO THE BEST OF OUR 
KNOWLEDGE, NO PREACHERS, MOSQUES, OR EDUCATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS HAVE EMERGED AS CENTERS OF RADICALISM. 
THERE ARE NO RADICAL MUSLIM BROADCASTS ON LOCAL RADIO 
AND TV.  BOTSWANA TELEVISION (BTV) IS GOVERNMENT-OWNED, 
AS ARE THE RADIO STATIONS THAT REACH THE LARGEST 
PROPORTION OF LISTENERS IN BOTSWANA, RADIO BOTSWANA AND 
RB2.  TWO INDEPENDENT RADIO STATIONS EXIST, GABZ-FM AND 
YARONA-FM, AND ARE MORE POPULAR THAN STATE-OWNED RADIO, 
BUT THESE HAVE ONLY A LIMITED BROADCASTING RANGE. 
NEITHER STATION BROADCASTS ISLAMIC RADICALISM OVER THE 
AIRWAVES, ALTHOUGH LOCAL CALL-IN TALK SHOWS GIVE 
ANONYMOUS CALLERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VENT ANTI-AMERICAN 
SENTIMENT AT TIMES. 
 
4.  (C) POLITICAL PARTIES.  THERE IS NO POLITICAL PARTY 
IDENTIFIED WITH ISLAMIC RADICALISM IN BOTSWANA.  THE 
LEADING OPPOSITION PARTY, THE BOTSWANA NATIONAL FRONT 
(BNF), ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT ASKS ALL BATSWANA TO 
\"CONDEMN TERRORISM AND ALL ITS MANIFESTATIONS AND FORMS 
EVEN IF IT IS PERPETUATED BY SUPERPOWERS, MIDDLE-SIZED 
COUNTRIES, SMALL COUNTRIES, ORGANIZATIONS OR 
INDIVIDUALS.\"  THE BNF IS A PARTY OF SOCIO-DEMOCRATIC 
LEANINGS, BEGAN BY DR. KENNETH KOMA, WHO OBTAINED HIS 
PH.D. IN THE SOVIET UNION IN THE 1960S.  THE BNF\'S 
PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER IS MR. MOHAMMED KHAN. 
 
5.  (C) NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THERE ARE NO 
KNOWN NGOS, CHARITABLE OR OTHERWISE, WITH KNOWN TIES TO 
ISLAMIC RADICALISM.  WE KNOW OF ONE ORGANIZATION, THE 
BOTSWANA MUSLIM ASSOCIATION (BMA), WHICH FOCUSES ON 
ISSUES OF INTEREST TO MUSLIMS.  THE BMA EXECUTIVE BOARD 
CONSISTS OF ABDUL SATAR DADA, PRESIDENT (DADA IS 
TREASURER FOR THE RULING BOTSWANA DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND 
THE ONLY NON-BLACK AFRICAN IN BOTSWANA\'S PARLIAMENT); 
ISMAIL IBRAHIM, VICE-PRESIDENT; ABDUL MALEK MELAMU, 
SECRETARY GENERAL; MOHAMMED IQBAL CHAND, ASSISTANT

ES SALAAM) WERE PLANNED BY THE ISRAELIS.\" 
 
7.  (C) FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES. 
WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVING 
TIES TO RADICAL ISLAM.  THE FOUR MAJOR BANKS IN 
BOTSWANA, BARCLAYS AND STANDARD CHARTERED, STANBIC AND 
FINANCIAL BANK OF BOTSWANA, ARE BASED OUT OF THE UK AND 
SOUTH AFRICA, RESPECTIVELY.  WE WILL BE MEETING WITH 
EACH OF THOSE BANKS SHORTLY TO GAUGE PROGRESS IN 
IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1373.  WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS 
(ORIGINALLY FROM THE RAPPORT, AN AFRIKAANS LANGUAGE 
NEWSPAPER IN SOUTH AFRICA, REPRINTED IN THE CAPE TOWN 
NEWS) THAT ONE OF TWO BUSINESSMEN INVOLVED IN THE 
WATERVAL ISLAMIC INSTITUTE IN MIDRAND, GAUTENG, HAS TIES 
TO THE BANKING INDUSTRY OF BOTSWANA.  RSO AND THE 
BOTSWANA SPECIAL BRANCH OF THEIR POLICE SERVICE ARE 
FOLLOWING UP ON THIS ALLEGATION, BUT HAVE TURNED UP NO 
NEW INFORMATION. 
 
8.  (C) SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STUDY ABROAD.  WE HAVE NO 
INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE LOCAL MUSLIM STUDENTS ARE SENT 
ABROAD FOR STUDY.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME BATSWANA MAY 
HAVE RECEIVED SCHOLARSHIPS TO STUDY IN LIBYA, WHICH HAS 
AN EMBASSY HERE, BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOLARSHIPS 
FOR STUDY EMANATE FROM THE GOB, WHICH SENDS THE LARGE 
MAJORITY OF ITS SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS TO THE UK AND THE 
U.S.  A SMALL MINORITY WERE SENT TO STUDY AT AN 
ENGINEERING COLLEGE IN MALAYSIA, BUT A NUMBER OF THOSE 
STUDENTS WERE EXPELLED AFTER THEY STAGED A WALKOUT 
COMPLAINING THAT THEIR COLLEGE WAS IN FACT A SHOPPING 
MALL IN MALAYSIA. 
 
9.  (C) FOREIGN ITINERANTS.  WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF 
FOREIGN ITINERANTS WITH KNOWN OR RUMORED TIES TO RADICAL 
ISLAM LIVING IN OR REGULARLY TRANSITING THE COUNTRY. 
THE COUNTRY\'S BORDERS, HOWEVER, ARE QUITE POROUS, AND 
BOTSWANA\'S GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO 
KNOW IF ITINERANTS ARE TRANSITING THE COUNTRY. 
 
10.  (C) CONTACT INFORMATION AND RUMORS.  RSO CONTACTS 
NOTED WITH SURPRISE REPORTS THAT THE BMA WAS UNABLE TO 
REACH A CONSENSUS ON ISSUING A STATEMENT OF CONDOLENCE 
AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACK.  ACCORDING TO 
SOURCE, DADA BASICALLY \"BOUGHT HIS WAY IN\" TO THE BMA, 
AND CONTROLLED THE ORGANIZATION.  SOURCE THEORIZED THAT 
EITHER DADA TRULY DID NOT WANT A CONDOLENCE STATEMENT 
ISSUED (CONTRARY TO HIS STATEMENT TO AMBASSADOR AND 
DCM), OR THAT THE YOUTH WING BOTSWANA MUSLIM MOVEMENT IS 
EXERTING MORE AUTHORITY WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION THAN 
MAINSTREAM BMA MEMBERS ANTICIPATED.

SUBJECT: A GRASS-ROOTS LOOK AT HIV/AIDS IN BOTSWANA 
 
REF: GABORONE 3255 
 
INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
 
1.  DURING OUR RECENT TRAVELS UPCOUNTRY, THE AMBASSADOR 
AND EMBASSY STAFF LOOKED AT COMMUNITY-BASED ACTIVITIES IN 
THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS AND INTERAGENCY USG SUPPORT 
FOR THOSE EFFORTS.  IT WAS A SOBERING EXPERIENCE THAT 
EMPHASIZED THE DEBILITATING SOCIAL EFFECTS OF THE 
DISEASE. 
 
SELEBI-PHIKWE: \"NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY, NUMBER ONE IN 
THE WORLD\"; THE STIGMA OF HIV IS \"GENOCIDE\" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  ON OCTOBER 19, WE ATTENDED THE OFFICIAL OPENING IN 
SELEBI-PHIKWE OF ANOTHER TEBELOPELE VOLUNTARY COUNSELING 
AND TESTING CENTER.  AS PART OF OUR INTERAGENCY EFFORT, 
THE IBB/VOA STATION MANAGER INITIATED NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR THE PLOT OF LAND, THE OFFICE OF 
DEFENSE COOPERATION BUILT THE STRUCTURE, AND THE CENTERS 
FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION PROVIDED EQUIPMENT AND 
STAFF.  THE OFFICIAL OPENING, WHICH ATTRACTED AROUND 200 
PEOPLE, WAS AN UPBEAT EVENT WITH A SERIOUS THEME.  IT 
INCLUDED A TENT AND LARGE \"KNOW YOUR STATUS\" SIGNS TO 
ATTRACT ATTENTION ON THE TOWN\'S MAIN STREET; A SKIT IN 
SETSWANA ON HIV/AIDS; AND SPEECHES BY LOCAL OFFICIALS, 
THE AMBASSADOR AND THE MINISTER OF HEALTH. 
 
3.  IN AN IMPASSIONED SPEECH ALTERNATING BETWEEN ENGLISH 
AND SETSWANA, MINISTER OF HEALTH JOY PHUMAPHI USED A 
PHRASE WE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY HEARD FROM GOB LEADERS.  SHE 
SAID THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH HIV/AIDS IS THE WORST 
CRIME THAT BATSWANA HAVE EVER COMMITTED AGAINST 
THEMSELVES AND SHE TERMED IT \"GENOCIDE.\"  SHE ALSO 
STRESSED THE POINT THAT A LEGAL DOCUMENT OF MARRIAGE DOES 
NOT PROVIDE ANY PROTECTION AGAINST HIV AND URGED PEOPLE 
TO BE TESTED PRIOR TO MARRIAGE.  (SHE HAS TOLD US IN THE 
PAST THAT IN BOTSWANA, WHEN ONE PERSON IS INFECTED, THE 
SPOUSE IS GENERALLY ALSO INFECTED.) 
 
4.  IN HIS CLOSING REMARKS, THE TOWN CLERK DERISIVELY 
PROCLAIMED SELEBI-PHIKWE AS \"NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY, 
NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD\" IN HIV INFECTION.  HE NOTED THAT 
BOTSWANA LEADS THE WORLD IN HIV INFECTION RATES AND 
WITHIN THE COUNTRY SELEBI-PHIKWE HAD TAKEN THE TOP SPOT 
FROM FRANCISTOWN.  HE CITED THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES 
FROM THE DECEMBER 2000 HIV SURVEY FOR BOTSWANA (FUNDED IN 
PART BY CDC) ESTIMATING THAT 45.7 PERCENT OF ADULTS AGED 
15-49 IN THE TOWN ARE HIV POSITIVE.  (SEE REFTEL FOR A 
FULLER SUMMARY OF THAT SURVEY.)  THE CLERK ALSO DESCRIBED 
THE HUMAN IMPACT OF THE TOLL: THE COUNCIL CARES FOR 445 
ORPHANED CHILDREN WHO ARE SCATTERED IN FOSTER HOMES 
AROUND TOWN (POPULATION 50,000). 
 
FRANCISTOWN: HELPING CHILD-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS WHERE 
PARENTS HAVE DIED OF AIDS; OTHER VULNERABLE CHILDREN 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5.  IN FRANCISTOWN THAT EVENING, MINISTER PHUMAPHI (WHOSE 
PARLIAMENTARY DISTRICT IS FRANCISTOWN EAST AND WHOSE 
HUSBAND IS A PROMINENT ATTORNEY) HOSTED THE LAUNCHING OF 
A TRUST AIMED AT ASSISTING (THROUGH PROVISION OF SHELTER, 
TRAINING, ETC.) THE LIVES OF DISADVANTAGED MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMUNITY (INCLUDING THE NEEDY, HOMELESS AND DESTITUTE 
ORPHANS).  THE BASIC HOUSE TO BE PROVIDED TO THOSE IN 
NEED WILL CONSIST OF ONE BEDROOM, ONE KITCHENETTE AND ONE 
BATHROOM BUILT ON A SLAB FOR A TWO-ROOM HOUSE.  MANY OF 
THE COMMUNITY LEADERS OF FRANCISTOWN (POPULATION 84,000) 
WERE IN ATTENDANCE AND THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
GAVE THE KEYNOTE SPEECH. 
 
6.  PHUMAPHI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT MUCH OF THE WORK OF 
THE TRUST WILL BE AIMED AT CHILD-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS, WHERE 
CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 14 ARE CARING FOR THEIR YOUNGER 
SIBLINGS AFTER THE DEATH OR INCAPACITATION OF THEIR 
PARENTS DUE TO AIDS.  OTHER HOUSEHOLDS TO BE ASSISTED 
INCLUDE THOSE IN WHICH BOTH PARENTS HAVE DIED AND THE 
AGING GRANDPARENTS ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES COPING WITH 
CHILD-CARING RESPONSIBILITIES.  ACCORDING TO PHUMAPHI, 
THE PERFORMANCE OF CHILDREN AT SCHOOL TENDS TO DECLINE IN 
THE LAST YEARS PRIOR TO THE DEATH OF A PARENT AS THE 
CHILD SUFFERS FROM STRESS AND ADDITIONAL DUTIES AT HOME. 
THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR HER EFFORTS AND 
PROVIDED AN APPLICATION FORM FOR SELF-HELP PROGRAM 
FUNDING. 
 
7.  ON OCTOBER 20, THE SHINING STARS OF FRANCISTOWN\'S 
MONARCH COMMUNITY OFFICIALLY OPENED THEIR NEW FACILITIES 
PAID FOR BY ODC AND THE SELF-HELP PROGRAM.  MINISTER 
PHUMAPHI AND THE AMBASSADOR WERE KEYNOTE SPEAKERS. 
SHINING STARS IS A COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAM, ORGANIZED 
UNDER TRUSTEESHIP OF THE TSHIRELETSO AIDS AWARENESS 
GROUP, BENEFITING 275 VULNERABLE CHILDREN AGED 2 - 18. 
THESE INCLUDE THOSE WHO ARE DESTITUTE, HAVE ILL PARENTS, 
OR ARE ILL THEMSELVES.  THE ORGANIZATION DOES NOT LIMIT 
ITSELF TO \"AIDS ORPHANS,\" AS AIDS CARRIES A STIGMA THAT 
IS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED FROM PARENT TO CHILD. 
CHILDREN ENGAGE IN LIFE SKILLS, ACADEMIC AND SPORTS 
ACTIVITIES AND ARE EDUCATED ABOUT HIV (\"SO THEY CAN STAY 
BEHIND WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GONE,\" ACCORDING TO THE 
SHINING STARS DIRECTOR).  ALL WORK IS PERFORMED BY 
VOLUNTEERS, AS THERE ARE NO PAID STAFF.  ONE OF THE TASKS 
FOR ADULT SPONSORS IS TO CARE FOR PARENTS SICK WITH AIDS 
SO THAT THEIR CHILDREN CAN ATTEND SCHOOL. 
 
8.  THE ODC SUPPORT, PROVIDED THROUGH DOD\'S HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, INCLUDES TWO BUILDINGS, A 
CLASSROOM/LIBRARY AND A KITCHEN/COMMON ROOM/REST ROOM 
FACILITY.  THE AMBASSADOR\'S SELF-HELP FUND HAS PROVIDED 
SHINING STARS WITH EDUCATIONAL EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE AND A 
COMMERCIAL OVEN FOR PRODUCING BREAD FOR SALE TO THE 
COMMUNITY.  PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BREAD WILL BE USED 
TO COVER ORPHAN-CARE OPERATING EXPENSES.  IT IS HOPED 
THAT THIS WILL REDUCE SHINING STARS\' DEPENDENCE ON LOCAL 
DONORS AS WELL AS GIVE ORPHAN BENEFICIARIES A SENSE OF 
BEING ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. 
 
9.  THE DIRECTOR HAS WORKED VERY HARD AND IS DOING A 
COMMENDABLE JOB, BUT SHE STILL DOES NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH 
COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR EVERYDAY EXPENSES: THE ELECTRIC 
COMPANY HAD THREATENED TO CUT OFF POWER ON THE DAY 
PRECEDING THE EVENT.  THIS IS THE SAME ORGANIZATION WHERE 
THE CHILDREN, DURING OUR VISIT LAST YEAR, SERENADED US 
WITH A SONG CARRYING THE HAUNTING REFRAIN, \"MY MOTHER 
DIED BEFORE I MET HER.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10.  THE TWO-DAY TRIP PROVIDED US WITH ANOTHER GLIMPSE AT 
THE PERVASIVE IMPACT HIV/AIDS IS HAVING ON BOTSWANA.  NOT 
ONLY ARE MANY ADULTS ALREADY INFECTED, INCLUDING NEARLY 
ONE OUT OF TWO PEOPLE IN THEIR 20S, BUT LARGE NUMBERS OF 
CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE BORN HIV 
POSITIVE OR BECAUSE THEIR RELATIVES ARE DYING OF AIDS. 
AMONG THE MANY USG PROGRAMS IN BOTSWANA RELATED TO 
HIV/AIDS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS AIMED AT 
ASSISTING SUCH NEEDY CASES.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1.  THE GOB HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO ENSURE THAT 
ITS FINANCIAL SYSTEM DOES NOT BECOME A HAVEN FOR ILLEGAL 
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER MONEY LAUNDERING, DRUG 
TRAFFICKING, OR TERRORIST FINANCING.  WHILE WE STILL HAVE 
CONCERNS ABOUT VARYING LEVELS OF IMPLEMENTATION BY THE 
DIFFERENT AGENCIES INVOLVED, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE 
MECHANISMS INVOLVED, BOTH THOSE PRE-EXISTING AND THOSE 
UNDER DEVELOPMENT, WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY AND TO 
BLOCK TERRORIST\' ACCESS TO FINANCING IN BOTSWANA.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
++++++++++ 
 
2.  THE FOLLOWING CONSTITUTES OUR ANSWERS TO THE 
QUESTIONS PRESENTED IN REF A.  AS FURTHER INFORMATION 
DEVELOPS, WE WILL UPDATE THESE ANSWERS.  ALL DOCUMENTS 
REFERRED TO BELOW ARE BEING SENT TO THE TREASURY 
DEPARTMENT\'S FOREIGN LAW UNI VIA EXPRESS COURIER (REF E). 
 
A.  THE GOB HAS BEEN PUBLICLY SUPPORTIVE OF GLOBAL 
COALITION EFFORTS AGAINST TERRORISM, INCLUDING FINANCIAL 
MEASURES.  THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF BOTSWANA (BOB) 
BOTSWANA\'S CENTRAL BANK, ISSUED A LETTER OCTOBER 8 TO ALL 
BANKS IN BOTSWANA OUTLINING EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224, 
DIRECTING THAT CONSTITUENT BANKS HALT PAYMENT AND/OR 
TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO OR FOR ACCOUNTS OF ANY PERSON LISTED 
BY SUCH ORDER.  BOB DIRECTOR OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
MOSES PELAELO ISSUED A FOLLOW-UP LETTER OCTOBER 17 WHICH 
PROVIDED THE UPDATED LIST OF ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS 
WHOSE ASSETS ARE TO BE BLOCKED. 
RELEVANT TEXT OF THE LETTERS FOLLOWS: 
 
++++++++++ 
 
OCTOBER 8, 2001 
 
THIS IS TO REMIND YOU THAT BOTSWANA IS A SIGNATORY TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF THE 
FINANCING OF TERRORISM AND OTHER ANTI-TERRORISM 
CONVENTIONS.  THIS MEANS THAT ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
IN BOTSWANA, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE ALL 
MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THEY DO NOT UNWITTINGLY PROVIDE 
SAFE HARBOR FOR TERRORIST ACTIONS OR ACTIVITIES.  THIS 
FOLLOWS THE SIGNING OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BY THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHICH PROVIDES 
FOR BLOCKING PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN PROPERTY OF 
PERSONS WHO HAVE COMMITTED OR POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF 
COMMITTING ACTS OF TERRORISM. 
 
PLEASE FIND ATTACHED HEREWITH THE PAPER ON THE US 
EXECUTIVE ORDER AS WELL AS AN ANNEX DETAILING PERSONS 
WHOSE INTERESTS HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED, THUS 
FAR, BY THE US GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDINGLY, WITH IMMEDIATE 
EFFECT, NO PAYMENT AND/OR TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO, OR FOR 
ACCOUNTS OF ANY PERSONS LISTED THEREIN ARE PERMITTED, 
WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL BY THE GOVERNMENT OF 
BOTSWANA. 
 
++++++++++ 
 
OCTOBER 17, 2001 
 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE 
FINANCING OF TERRORISM 
 
FURTHER TO THE GOVERNOR\'S LETTER OF OCTOBER 8, 2001 ON 
THE ABOVE, PLEASE FIND HEREWITH AN UPDATED LIST OF 
ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHOSE FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE TO BE 
BLOCKED. 
 
ACCORDINGLY, WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT, NO PAYMENT AND/OR 
TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO OR FOR ACCOUNT OF ANY PERSON LISTED 
IN ANNEXURE I SHALL BE PERMITTED, WITHOUT THE PRIOR 
APPROVAL BY THE GOVERNMENT OF BOTSWANA. 
 
++++++++++ 
 
B. BOB ADVISOR (AND FORMER FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF 
CHICAGO EMPLOYEE) JOHN MONTGOMERY EXPLAINED TO US ON 
OCTOBER 29 THAT THE LETTERS QUOTED ABOVE DO NOT RISE TO 
THE LEVEL OF A FREEZE ORDER.  A FREEZE ORDER WOULD NEED 
TO COME FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S OFFICE OR FROM A 
COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, DIRECTING ACTION AGAINST 
A SPECIFIC ACCOUNT, ENTITY, PERSON, OR INSTITUTION, HE 
SAID.  OUR PRESUMPTION IS THAT, SHOULD A FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTION REPORT TO THE BOB THE EXISTENCE OF SPECIFIC 
ACCOUNTS, ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION WOULD FOLLOW, BUT THAT 
PRESUMPTION HAS NOT BEEN TESTED. 
 
C.  THE GOB HAS THUS FAR BLOCKED NO ASSETS UNDER THIS 
ORDER, NOR HAS ANY BANK THUS FAR REPORTED THE EXISTENCE 
OF ACCOUNTS BEING HELD BY ANY OF THE ENTITIES MENTIONED 
IN THE ANNEX AND UPDATE TO E.O. 13324. 
 
D. 
 
(I)  WE ARE STILL TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER A UN 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION, SUCH AS UNSCR 1267 OR 1373, 
IS REQUIRED BEFORE ASSETS MAY BE FROZEN UNDER BOTSWANA 
LAW.  THE ABOVE OCTOBER 8 AND OCTOBER 17 LETTERS NOTE 
THAT BOTSWANA IS A SIGNATORY TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF 
TERRORISM AND OTHER ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS.  BOB 
ISSUED THE LETTERS DIRECTING NO FURTHER TRANSFERS OR 
PAYMENTS TO THE LISTED PERSONS OR ENTITIES UNDER THEIR 
OBLIGATIONS PURSUANT TO THAT AUTHORITY.  FURTHER LEGAL 
ACTION AGAINST THE ACCOUNTS OR THEIR HOLDERS WOULD BE THE 
PURVIEW OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S OFFICE. 
 
(II)  WE ARE STILL TRYING TO ASCERTAIN HOW UN SECURITY 
COUNCIL 1373 WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH 
LISTS.  MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY MPOFU IS CHAIRING AN AD 
HOC INTER-AGENCY COMMITTEE TASKED WITH IMPLEMENTING UNSCR 
1373.  (REF D).  THE BANK OF BOTSWANA HAS ALREADY 
DIRECTED BOTSWANA BANKS NOT TO ACT ON ANY ACCOUNTS HELD 
BY PERSONS MENTIONED IN THE ANNEX TO E.O. 13324 AND ITS 
UPDATE THROUGH THE LETTERS ABOVE. 
 
(III)  WE ARE STILL TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER A LIST 
ADOPTED BY A MULTILATERAL BODY OTHER THAN THE UN SECURITY 
COUNCIL IS REQUIRED FOR SUCH FREEZING.  AS BOB ADVISOR 
MONTGOMERY INDICATED, FREEZING ACCOUNTS IN BOTSWANA CAN 
ONLY OCCUR PURSUANT TO ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR BY A 
COURT OF COMPETENT AUTHORITY, AND CAN ONLY BE DIRECTED AT 
A SPECIFIC ACCOUNT.  (NOTE:  BOTSWANA IS A MEMBER OF THE 
FINANCIAL AFFAIRS TASK FORCE (FATF) OF COMMONWEALTH 
COUNTRIES, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE FATF WOULD HAVE 
DIFFERENT AUTHORITY OR IMPOSE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAN 
THOSE BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL.  END NOTE.) 
 
(IV)  THE BANKING ACT OF 1995 DOES NOT EXPRESSLY MENTION 
THE AUTHORITY TO FREEZE TERRORIST-RELATED OR TALIBAN- 
RELATED ASSETS.  PURSUANT TO ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF THE 
FINANCING OF TERRORISM AND OTHER ANTI-TERRORISM 
CONVENTIONS, THE BOB ISSUED THE LETTERS ABOVE DIRECTING 
BANKS TO CEASE ACTION ON ANY ACCOUNTS HELD BY PERSONS 
MENTIONED IN THE ANNEX AND UPDATE TO E.O. 13324. 
 
E.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE MFA THAT IMPLEMENTING 
LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED TO INCORPORATE MANDATORY UN 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS INTO BOTSWANA LAW. 
INTERNATIONAL TREATIES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY INCORPORATED 
INTO BOTSWANA LAW; THEY ARE DEEMED RATIFIED ONLY UPON 
SIGNATURE BY BOTSWANA\'S PRESIDENT.  AFTER RATIFICATION, 
THEN THE MINISTRY WITH LOCAL JURISDICTION OVER THE TREATY 
IN QUESTION, IN COORDINATION WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\'S 
OFFICE, WILL IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO BOTSWANA LAW TO 
ACCOMMODATE THE OBLIGATIONS STEMMING FROM THE TREATY IN 
QUESTION. 
 
F.  AS BOB\'S MONTGOMERY INDICATED, FREEZING ACCOUNTS IN 
BOTSWANA CAN ONLY OCCUR PURSUANT TO ATTORNEY GENERAL 
ACTION OR BY A COURT OF COMPETENT AUTHORITY, AND CAN ONLY 
BE DIRECTED AT A SPECIFIC ACCOUNT.  PURSUANT TO ITS 
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE 
SUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM AND OTHER ANTI- 
TERRORISM CONVENTIONS, THE BOB ISSUED THE LETTERS ABOVE 
DIRECTING BANKS TO CEASE ACTION ON ANY ACCOUNTS HELD BY 
PERSONS MENTIONED IN THE ANNEX AND UPDATE TO E.O. 13324. 
 
G.  IF THE USG WERE TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC ACCOUNT/ACCOUNT 
HOLDER/FINANCIAL INSTITUTION INFORMATION, IT APPEARS 
POSSIBLE THAT THE AG\'S OFFICE COULD ISSUE A FREEZE ORDER. 
ABSENT THAT, THE GOB COULD BLOCK ALL TRANSACTIONS TO ANY 
CATEGORY OF ACCOUNTS IMMEDIATELY, AND SUBSEQUENTLY MOVE 
TO FREEZE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS ONCE IDENTIFIED. 
 
H.  BOB FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEPUTY DIRECTOR NCUBE ON 
OCTOBER 29 GAVE US THREE DOCUMENTS WHICH THE GOB CREATED 
PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 11 TO AUGMENT ITS EFFORTS IN TRACKING 
ILLEGAL FINANCIAL ACTIVITY: \"DIRECTIVE BOB 3/2001: 
GUIDELINES FOR AN ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAM\"; AN 
\"EXAMPLES OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY\" HANDOUT; AND A 
\"SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORT\" FORM FOR NOTICE AND COMMENT 
TO BANKS IN BOTSWANA.  THESE DOCUMENTS, CURRENTLY BEING 
CURCULATED TO BANKS IN BOTSWANA FOR COMMENT, WILL BE 
INCORPORATED AS DIRECTIVES INTO REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKS IN 
BOTSWANA TO REPORT MONEY-LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES, AS PER 
SECTION 21(4) OF THE BANKING ACT OF 1995.  BOB\'S TARGET 
DATE FOR IMPLEMENTING THESE DIRECTIVES IS JANUARY 2002. 
 
(I)  WE BELIEVE THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE BOB OCTOBER 8 
AND OCTOBER 17 CONSTITUTE THEIR RESPONSE TO FINANCIAL 
REQUIREMENTS OF THE RESOLUTIONS. 
 
(II) BOB OFFICIALS REPORT NO TERRORIST ASSETS HAVE BEEN 
LOCATED, AND THEREFORE NO FINANCING HAS BEEN FROZEN, 
UNDER UNSCR 1267, 1333, OR 1373. 
 
I.  PLEASE SEE ANSWER TO H. ABOVE. 
 
J.  ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, THE GOB HAS VOICED ITS 
\"UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT\" IN OUR EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM. 
(REF D).  PRESIDENT MOGAE GAVE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF HOW 
BOTSWANA\'S LAWS ARE ALREADY DESIGNED TO THWART ILLEGAL 
FINANCIAL ACTIVITY, INCLUDING TERRORIST FINANCING (REF 
C).  FOREIGN MINISTER MERAFHE HAS ASSURED US THAT 
BOTSWANA WILL BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF 
UNSCR 1373 (REF C).  WE RECENTLY SENT A DIPLOMATIC NOTE 
TO THE MFA NOTING THAT WE WOULD WELCOME ANY INFORMATION 
IT CAN PROVIDE PRIOR TO THE REQUIRED 90-DAY REPORT TO THE 
UN. 
 
K.  THE OCTOBER 17 LETTER QUOTED IN PARA (A) INCLUDED THE 
COMPLETE USG LISTS OF 39 NAMES. 
 
L.  THE BOB OWES NO DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY TO ACCOUNT 
HOLDERS.  SECTION 43(1) OF THE BANKING ACT OF 1995 
IMPOSES A DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY ON THE BANKS TO THEIR 
ACCOUNT HOLDERS IN BOTSWANA, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN 
EXCEPTIONS.  BANK OF BOTSWANA ACT SECTION 59, HOWEVER, 
NOTES THAT \"FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF 
THIS ACT AND IN THE PROPER PERFORMANCE OF ITS FUNCTIONS 
UNDER THIS ACT, THE BANK MAY CALL FOR SUCH INFORMATION AS 
IT MAY REQUIRE FROM ANY PERSON.\"  SECTION 60 STATES THAT 
\"THE BANK (OF BOTSWANA) SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY OF 
THE PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER 
THE BANKING ACT. 
 
M.  COPIES OF ALL AVAILABLE LAWS AND THE LETTERS 
MENTIONED ABOVE ARE BEING SENT VIA EXPRESS COURIER TO THE 
TREASURY DEPARTMENT\'S FOREIGN LAW UNIT.  THE PACKAGE WILL 
INCLUDE: 
 
  -- BANKING ACT OF 1995; 
 
  -- BANK OF BOTSWANA ACT OF 1996, INCLUDING ITS 1999 
     AMENDMENT;

REF: GABORONE 3681 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN E. LANGE FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B AND D). 
 
 
1. (C) PRESIDENT FESTUS MOGAE (PROTECT) BELIEVES THERE 
IS NO CHANCE TO INFLUENCE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT ROBERT 
MUGABE TO HOLD FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS BY MARCH.  HE 
SAID MUGABE IS ACTING LIKE A \"WOUNDED BUFFALO\" AND IT 
WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE THE ELECTIONS SOONER RATHER THAN 
LATER TO LESSEN THE HARM THAT IS BEING DONE.

ELECTIONS, MOGAE SAID THERE PROBABLY WOULD BE MEETINGS 
BUT HE SAW NO CHANCE OF SUCCESS.  IN PAST SADC 
DISCUSSIONS ON ZIMBABWE, HE SAID HE HAD LED THE 
DISCUSSION OF ECONOMIC CONCERNS AND WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY 
PRESIDENT MBEKI.  NOW, HE SAID (ONLY HALF-JOKINGLY) THAT 
THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE MUGABE FROM POWER WOULD BE TO 
ATTACK MILITARILY AND REMOVE HIM FORCEFULLY.  THE 
AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED A SCENARIO IN WHICH MUGABE AND 
ZANU-PF WERE SO UNPOPULAR THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY LOSE 
THE ELECTIONS DESPITE ALL OF THE VIOLENCE AND 
INTIMIDATION IN ADVANCE.  MOGAE RESPONDED THAT MUGABE IS 
VERY SMART AND IS ALREADY WORKING TO PREVENT THAT 
POSSIBILITY, INCLUDING THROUGH HIS LATEST EFFORT TO 
DISENFRANCHISE THOSE ZIMBABWEANS LIVING ABROAD. 
 
3.   (C) THE CONVERSATION THEN TURNED TO THE IMPACT ON 
SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE CONTINENT AS A WHOLE.  THE 
AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF NEPAD, WHICH 
EMPHASIZES AFRICA\'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE, 
COULD BE UNDERCUT IF THE ELECTIONS WERE STOLEN.  MOGAE 
DISMISSED THE IMPORTANCE OF NEPAD, WHICH HE VIEWS AS 
BROAD RHETORIC HAVING LITTLE REAL IMPACT ON THE GROUND. 
HE SAID THE COB HAS GONE ALONG WITH THE PROGRAM BECAUSE 
IT AGREES WITH THE GOALS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS LOW 
EXPECTATIONS FOR IT. 
 
4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED MOGAE IF HE FORESAW STRONG 
MEASURES BY SADC, POSSIBLY EVEN INCLUDING EXPULSION, 
SHOULD THE ELECTIONS TURN OUT AS BADLY AS MANY PREDICT. 
MOGAE WAS UNCERTAIN ABOUT SADC PROCEDURES IN SUCH A CASE 
BUT ADDED THAT ZIMBABWE\'S \"APOLOGISTS\" (UNNAMED) WOULD 
ARGUE THAT THE SITUATIONS IN SADC MEMBER STATES ANGOLA 
AND THE DRC WERE SUCH THAT ZIMBABWE DID NOT MERIT BEING 
SINGLED OUT FOR EXPLUSION FROM THE ORGANIZATION. 
 
5.  (C) COMMENT.  MOGAE\'S VIEWS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE 
PESSIMISM EXPRESSED TO US EARLIER BY FOREIGN MINISTER 
MERAFHE (REFTEL).  MOGAE BRIDLES AT THE MEMORY OF BEING 
BERATED BY THE \"WAR VETERANS\" DURING THE SADC TASK FORCE 
VISIT TO ZIMBABWE ON SEPTEMBER 9.  DESPITE OUR EFFORTS 
TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUED ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT, THE COB NOW 
SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN UP ON THE PROSPECTS OF INFLUENCING 
MUGABE.

SUBJECT: REGIONAL CONFERENCE DELIBERATES ENHANCED 
COOPERATION ON TERRORISM 
 
Classified By: DCM LOIS AROIAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) & (D) 
 
1. (C>  SUMMARY:  Victory in the war on terrorism requires a 
multilateral approach, an appreciation of the \"root causes\" of 
terrorism, and a response that engages rather than alienates 
communities, President Mogae told a November 22-24 conference 
on terrorism in southern Africa.  Despite Mogae\'s plea for 
specific recommendations to improve regional counter-terrorism 
 (CT) cooperations conference deliberations focused on the 
nature of the terrorist threats posed to southern Africa, 
including jurisdiction shopping, travel document fraud, and 
using the region as a logistics point.  While Botswana is 
pursuing an effective CT strategy, the paucity of concrete 
conclusions from the conference shows that capacity-building 
remains a primary challenge to achieving regional cooperation 
in the war on terrorism in southern Africa.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
UNDERSTANDING TERRORISM 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U)  Botswana\'s President Mogae delivered the opening 
remarks at a November 22-24 conference in Gaborone on terrorism 
in southern Africa.  Interpol the Southern Africa Regional 
Police Chiefs Organization and the Institute for Security 
Studies, a South African think tank, co-hosted the conference. 
Mogae\'s talk made the following points: 
 
 -- terrorism is not a new phenomenon: understanding the 
historical context and \"root causes\" of a particular terrorist 
movement is a prerequisite for combatting it effectively. 
 -- law enforcement agencies must target three aspects of 
terrorist movements: attempts to instill fear in enemies, to 
increase popular support and to generate income, all now being 
done internationally. 
 
 -- to achieve a cooperative international response, conferees 
should critically assess the existing patterns of regional 
cooperation regarding terrorism and suggest ways to improve. 
Just as no country is immune from the threat of terrorism, so 
no country can successfully defend itself through unilateral 
actions. 
 -- responses to the threat of terrorism must unify people and 
engage, rather than estrange, communities and law enforcement 
bodies.  The tendency to blame entire religious or ethnic 
groups for the acts of a few divides the international 
community. 
 
 -- some measures, such as certain visa restrictions and 
security procedures, perpetuate xenophobia perceptions. 
 
 -- political leaders have the responsibility to eliminate the 
poverty, oppression, exclusion, intolerance and the violation 
of human rights which feed terrorism. 
 
 -- The GOB was committed to taking on these challenges. 
 
------------------------------ 
COB REORGANIZING CT PROCEDURES 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C)  While President Mogae exhorted the confcrcnce 
participants to generate specific recommendations on how to 
improve international collaborations he did not mention that 
the COB is in the midst of enhancing its own coordination 
mechanism regarding terrorism.  According to contacts in the 
COB, a new structure will take responsibility for every aspect 
of counter-terrorism.  One interlocutor from the COB suggested 
that shifting lead action from the MFA to the Ministry 
Presidential Affairs reflects a desire to deal with terrorism 
as a national security threat rather than viewing it solely as 
an international issue.  Internal deliberations on how best to 
organize this committee are still underway. 
 
------------------------------------ 
TERRORIST THREATS TO SOUTHERN AFRICA 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (U)  The conference highlighted a numbe 
r of challenges SADC 
countries face in fighting terrorism.  Among these was the 
threat that terrorist organizations could use southern African 
countries as a stalling platform to organize and plan an attack. 
The discovery that some terror suspects had procured false 
passports from southern African countries, particularly South 
Africa, underscored the importance of improving the security of 
travel documents.  A representative from Interpol headquarters 
in Lyon pointed out the possibility that terror suspects 
engaged in \"jurisdiction shopping\" might find a SADC country an 
advantageous place from which to apply for asylum, thereby 
disrupting potential efforts to bring him or her to justice. 
5.  (U) A survey underway by the International Organization for 
Migration (ION) office in Pretoria intended to identify and 
address holes in border security within the region should help 
to begin drawing a more precise picture of southern Africa\'s 
vulnerability to exploitation by terrorists in some of the ways 
outlined above.  When some participants complained that 
Interpol presentations on terrorist activity in the region were 
light on substances an Interpol representative countered by 
asserting that the Lyon-based organization receives relatively 
little information from individual SADC countries. 
 
---------------------------- 
FEW CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS 
-------          ----------- 
6. (U)  Most of the recommendations made by the conference 
participants were vague (e.g. take additional steps to enhance 
the effective sharing of information).  On the legislative 
level, delegates urged SADC governments to adopt laws 
criminalizing the financing of terrorist groups and to 
harmonize extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements 
within the region.  They advised policymakers to formulate 
anti-terrorism strategies and establish anti-terrorism units. 
Operational suggestions included the identification by 
Interpol\'s sub-regional bureau for southern Africa of experts 
within the region who can mobilize to assist law enforcement 
agencies as needed. 
 
COMMENT 
 
7.  (C)  President Mogae\'s remarks on this occasion, and the 
GOB\'s ongoing efforts to enhance its ability to respond to the 
threat of terrorism, confirm the Government\'s commitment to 
accord high priority to counter-terrorism strategies.  Mission 
will continue to work with the GOB to identify ways in which 
the US can assist it to take effective measures to curb 
potential terrorist activity in Botswana and to enhance 
regional CT cooperation.  The dearth of information about the 
presence and activities of terrorist groups in southern Africa 
and the scarcity of specific recommendations highlight that 
lack of capacity within the region\'s under-resourced and over- 
burdened law enforcement institutions remains a primary 
challenge.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BC, SAN/CKGR Relocation 
SUBJECT: HIGH COURTCASE DEVELOPMENTS: FIRST PEOPLE OF THE 
KALAHARI V. GOVERNMENT\'OF BOTSWANA 
 
 
1. (C)  SUMMARY:  First People of the Kalahari\'s (FPK) High 
Court case against the Government of Botswana made slow 
progress during the month of November.  Developments outside 
the court room, including the FPK leader Roy Sesana\'s trip to 
the U.S. and U.K., the increasing involvement of Survival 
International (Sl) in the case, and the emergence of a plan to 
seek an audience with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, 
contributed to further international attention being given to 
the confrontation.  This internationalization of the dispute 
is likely to reinforce the GOB\'s position on the relocation of 
the Basarwa. Other NGOs in Botswana take a different strategy 
on the fate of the Basarwa and distance themselves from the 
FPK.   END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
SURVIVAL INTERNATIONAL STRENGTHENS TIES WITH FPK 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (C) At the request of the defendant, the High Court 
temporarily suspended the Sat case in July to allow the FPK 
sufficient time to raise funds for a continuance. The FPK case 
against the Government of Botswana resumed last month. During 
the interim, the FPK overhauled its team of lawyers, dropping 
South African attorneys Glyn Williams and John Whitehead, as 
well as Motswana Chris DuPlessis.  British barrister Gordon 
Bonnet, whom Williams had originally insisted on including in 
the legal team, took over as lead counsel.  Puma Boko, a local 
attorney experienced in human rights cases, joined him. 
According to Alice Mogwe, Director of the Botswana Center for 
Human Rights (also known as Ditshwanelo), the reshuffling of 
attorneys reflected SI\'s growing influence with the FPK. 
Bonnet reportedly is closely associated with SI, and an 
employee of that organization accompanied him to the Court. 
SI also is said to have played a key role in flying FPK leader 
Roy Sesana to the U.K. and to the U.S. in August and September 
on tours to promote the group\'s cause and raise money. 
 
3. (C)  When asked about the respective roles of SI and 
Ditshwanelo in the  case, Sesana told PolOff that SI was now 
sponsoring the case.  Sesana\'s  assistant Jumanda asserted, 
however, that Bonnet\'s links to SI notwithstanding,  he ls 
volunteering as counsel for the FPK, not acting on behalf of 
SI. Sesana confessed to being uncertain of Ditshwanelo\'s role 
and indicated his intention to meet with Alice Mogwe to confer 
about this. 
 
------------------------------------- 
DITSHWANELO ASSISTING SAN MORE BROADLY 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C)  In a November 16 meeting with PolOff, Ms. Mogwe 
explained that Ditshwanelo remains a friend of and advocate 
for the Sat but has no role  in the current court case. 
Ditshwanelo, she said, had assisted FPK and other Sat not 
represented by that group to meet with the Government to 
express their needs, and even extract some compromises. 
Convinced that negotiation, rather than confrontation with the 
GOB was the most effective strategy, Ditshwanelo began to pull 
back earlier this year when it became clear that the FPK 
preferred a court battle.  At this point, according to Alice 
Mogwe, Ditshwanelo still seeks to assist Sat  in ways not 
connected to the court case and intends to resume working with 
them  in negotiations with the Government when the court case 
finally concludes. 
 
--------------- 
FIRST PEOPLES OF THE KALAHARI NOT SOLE VOICE FOR SAN 
--------------- 
 
5. (U)  Ditshwanclo is not the only group concerned about San 
rights that has distanced itself from the FPK case.  On 
November 25, Kuru Trust launched 
 \"Voices of the San\", a 
hefty, detailed, beautifully-illustrated volume celebrating 
Sat culture.  The event, held in Gaborone, attracted a large, 
high-profile crowd.  The UNDP Representative gave the keynote 
address; the MP for Ghanzi was in the  audience.  No members 
of FPK were present, however.  Its absence underscores the 
distance Kuru Trust, an umbrella organization including many 
projects that advance Sat development, maintains from Sesana\'s 
group.  And in a recent newspaper interview with the newly 
elected BDP MP from Ghanzi District, Christian De Graaf, he 
was quoted as stating flatly that most Sat/Basarwa in his 
district are happy with the relocation out of the Central 
Kalahari Game Reserve and into the village of New Xade. 
Representatives of Sat groups near Shakawe, in the northwest 
Ngamiland District, during a briefing session with the DCM who 
visited the area from December 3-5, also distanced themselves 
from the FPK. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
DELAYS DUE TO TECHNICALITES AND RISING CRIME IN GABORONE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (U)  When the High Court hearings resumed on November 3, 
lead counsel for the state  Sidney Pilane challenged Boko\'s 
right to represent the applicants.  Pilane  argued that Boko 
needed a power of attorney signed by each of the 242 
applicants in the case.  The court ruled that because a letter 
signed by 131 former CKGR residents had instructed Roy Sesana 
to engage a new attorney, and Boko had obtained a power of 
attorney signed by Sesana, Boko could properly represent those 
applicants.  The remaining applicants in the case, the court 
concluded, were without representation since DuPlessis, 
Whitehead and Williams 
had withdrawn. 
7. (U)  After just one day of substantive hearings, the case 
was again  delayed.  On November 6, thugs assaulted Pilane by 
the roadsides stabbed him repeatedly, and left him seriously 
wounded.  The state requested a delay until its lead counsel 
could return to courtroom.  The High Court agreed to resume on 
November 22. The applicants continued to present witnesses 
until the court adjourned for the holidays on December 1. 
Hearings are scheduled to resume on January 17. 
 
------------------------------------ 
WITNESSES DESCRIBE FORCED RELOCATION 
------------------------------------ 
 
8. (U)  The witnesses for the FPK thus far have sought to 
establish that the relocation process was coercive. They have 
testified that political officials told them that they would 
have to leave the CKGR.  The uniformed police officers who 
came to move them to the resettlement points, they claimed, 
intimidated and mistreated them.  Several said they had lost 
livestock in the process and had seen their dwellings 
destroyed by government officers to discourage their return. 
The state presented evidence that residents of the reserve had 
signed agreements to relocate and had received compensation. 
Witnesses countered that they did not understand the documents 
they had signed or the amount of compensation they were to 
receive. One witness, however, did state that he knowingly 
signed the agreement, received the compensation and then 
returned to the CGKR. 
 
9. (U)  Witnesses described the resettlement village of New 
Xade as a crime-ridden and \'foreign\' environment.  In 
contrast, GOB sources have argued that New Xade is virtually 
identical to Old Xade in the CKGR, except that it boasts more 
public amenities. State counsel cited an anthroPologist\'s 
descriptions of Sat life in the CKGR in the 1960s to establish 
that San customs are identical those of other Batswana.  The 
implication of this argument is that there is no need for the 
GOB to treat the San differently from any other Batswana. 
 
----------------------------- 
FPK SEEKS AUDIENCE WITH UNSYG 
---------------------- 
 
10. (U)  In a November 24 conversation, Scsana and Jumanda 
informed PolOff that Rupert Isaacson is now trying to secure a 
meeting 
for Sesana with UN Secretary  General Kofi Annan. 
Isaacson, who is affiliated with the Indigenous Land Rights 
Fund, helped organize the August/September trip to the US and 
the associated fund-raising efforts.  Jumanda did not indicate 
the likelihood of this meeting\'s materializing.  The meeting 
would aim to increase international pressure on the GOB to 
change its policies relating to the Sat. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
- 
 
11.  (C)  The FPK and the COB continue to tread their divergent 
paths and claim authority for different narratives.  The FPK\'s 
strategy to internationalize this issue through fund-raising 
abroad, working with well-funded foreign NGOs, and engaging 
the United Nations is understandable, if counterproductive in 
the long run.  The COB, accustomed as it is to being praised 
by the international community, responds by asserting that the 
FPK is misrepresenting the facts and deliberately embarrassing 
the government before the world, in order to force the GOB\'s 
hand and cede to FPK\'s demands of restoring Sat access to the 
CKGR, their right to hunt, and the provision of public 
services there.  Whatever the outcome of this court case 
however, the Sat, like many other remote area dwellers (RADs) 
will still face the challenges of poverty and marginalization. 
The FPK\'s current strategy is likely to hamper any future 
cooperative role with the government in addressing the 
perennial problem of rural poverty, once the trial has ended.

SUBJECT: DOMESTIC CONCERN OVER ZIMBABWE SIMMERS 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOSEPH HUGGINS REASONS 1.5 (B) & (D) 
 
1. (C)  SUMMARY:  The perception of adverse impact on 
Botswana of the situation in neighboring Zimbabwe is steadily 
growing.  Debate over what the Government should do to 
mitigate the costs to the country continues to simmer. 
During National Assembly debates following President Mogae\'s 
November 8 State of the Nation address, parliamentarians 
highlighted the need for the Government to curb illegal 
immigration.  The press generates a steady stream of stories 
about the disruption caused by some illegal immigrants from 
Zimbabwe, including violent crime and cattle rustling.  In 
response to these and other challenges, the GOB is 
considering a nationwide operation to round up illegal 
immigrants from Zimbabwe.  If this plan materializes, 
Botswana could encounter international criticism for 
returning border jumpers to an uncertain future in Zimbabwe. 
END SUMMARY 
 
------------------------ 
CALLS FOR GOB TO DO MORE 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U)  During parliamentary debates following President 
Mogae\'s November 8 State of the Nation address, growing costs 
of illegal immigration from Zimbabwe emerged as an important 
concern.  The ruling Botswana Democratic Party\'s (BDP) MP for 
Tonota South, near Francistown, Pono Moatlhodi, called on the 
National Assembly to explore ways to curb the influx of 
illegal immigrants.  He blamed Zimbabwean border jumpers for 
the increased incidence of crime in Botswana.  Specially 
elected MP Botsalo Ntuane, also of the BDP, called for fresh 
efforts within the region \"to deal with the core issues of 
governance and an enabling political situation in Zimbabwe\" 
in order to avoid further negative spill-over effects for its 
neighbors. 
 
----------------------------------- 
PERCEIVED COSTS TO BOTSWANA GROWING 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (U)  Augmenting the general perception that illegal 
immigration from Zimbabwe has caused an increase in crime, 
recent newspaper accounts referred to allegations of cattle 
rustling across the border and incidences of violent 
conflicts in Francistown between supporters of Zimbabwe\'s 
opposition Movement for Democratic Change and the ZANU-PF by 
illegal Zimbabwean migrants.  While police officials have 
reportedly dismissed claims of battles between Zimbabwean 
partisans in Botswana, they have called for government 
support to check stock theft.  The public in Botswana is not 
vocal about the situation in Zimbabwe but they increasingly 
view as negative the impact of illegal migration from 
Zimbabwe on Botswana. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ROUND-UP IN THE OFFING? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C)  During a November 23 courtesy call, the new Minister 
for Labor and Home Affairs Moeng Pheto highlighted for the 
Ambassador the economic and administrative problems 
associated with illegal immigration from Zimbabwe.  He 
observed that such migrants had spread throughout the 
country, taking jobs far below the legal minimum wage, 
thereby exacerbating the problem of unemployment for 
Batswana.  Overcrowding in Botswana\'s prisons, which he 
estimated to be at 1,500 to 2,500 above the total capacity of 
3,500, derived in part from the holding of Zimbabweans, he 
claimed.  According to Minister Pheto, the GOB is considering 
a nation-wide \"sweep\" operation to round up Zimbabweans who 
are in Botswana illegally.  Plans along these lines had been 
stalled, he explained, by the absence of sufficient space in 
which to hold would-be detainees.  He added that efforts are 
underway to set up such facilities, which might include the 
use of tents at existing prisons. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C)  While the spillover effect from the situation in 
Zimbabwe has not yet reached a crisis point in Botswana, 
pressure is steadily growing on the GOB to take more 
effective measures to mitigate negative impacts.  More 
assertive action by the GOB in support of a democratic 
transition in Zimbabwe is unlikely but new measures to 
control border jumping and the problems it creates are 
probably forthcoming.  While it is unclear how many of these 
border jumpers back the MDC, and considering the ongoing food 
crisis in Zimbabwe, Botswana risks international criticism 
for returning them to an uncertain future in Zimbabwe.

SUBJECT:  OUTLOOK FOR RURAL AREA DWELLERS BLEAK 
 
 
1. SUMMARY:  The outlook for Botswana\'s Remote Area 
Dwellers (RADs) is bleak, despite the Government of 
Botswana\'s multifaceted efforts to improve their standard 
of living.  RADs endure high rates of poverty and 
unemployment, exacerbated by limited access to natural 
resources (especially land), a dearth of skills and their 
isolation from potential markets.  Prejudice against San 
(Basarwa), who constitute the majority of RADs, is 
widespread.  A climate of despair and dependence has 
emerged within this most marginalized community, further 
inhibiting progress.  The RADs\' best hope may lie in 
migration to towns in search of employment.  In spite of 
the hardships, RADs are generally pro-Government.  This 
is because they generally agree with the Government\'s 
policy objectives and lack leaders capable of mobilizing 
RADs and advocating for their interests.  Formation of a 
San Council might give RADs more effective representation 
in dealing with the Government.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------- 
BACKGROUND OF THE RADP 
---------------------- 
 
2. In 1975, the Government of Botswana established the 
Basarwa Development Program, to address the \"cultural, 
social and spatial\" impediments to development within 
this marginalized community.  Three years later, the 
Government expanded that program to include residents of 
remote areas from all ethnic groups and renamed it the 
Remote Area Development Program (RADP).  San, or Basarwa, 
still constitute the overwhelming majority of RADs. 
Other ethnic groups commonly found in RAD settlements 
include the Kgalagadi, Herero and Bayei.  In 1989, the 
program further evolved to focus on establishing 
permanent settlements in regions where RADs were most 
concentrated: Northwest, Kweneng, Central, Ghanzi, 
Kgalagadi, Southern, and Kgatleng Districts.  The 
Government encouraged RADs to move to these locales so 
that it could more efficiently provide public services 
and promote productive economic activities.  PolOff 
traveled to several RAD settlements in December to 
evaluate conditions there. 
 
3. The RADP aims to achieve sustainable social and 
economic development of Batswana living in remote areas 
and to ensure equal access to the benefits of the 
country\'s overall material progress.  The Government 
intends to accomplish this objective through the 
following:  providing infrastructure and public services 
comparable to those available elsewhere in the country, 
promoting gainful employment, enhancing access to land 
and other natural resources, encouraging participation in 
the nation\'s political process and the cultivation of 
community leaders, ensuring access to education and 
training at all levels, and facilitating the integration 
of RADs into the mainstream of society.  Through the 
RADP, the GOB has built clinics, schools, police stations 
and administrative centers, granted livestock, offered 
free vocational training, and provided for the education 
of RAD children including the costs of transportation, 
books and uniforms.  After nearly thirty years, however, 
the RADP is far from successful. 
 
--------------------------------- 
EMPLOYMENT VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. The key to the failure of the RADP is the lack of 
income-generating opportunities in the rural areas. 
Regular employment at RAD settlements is virtually non- 
existent.  In some places, a few individuals work for an 
NGO or a cooperative; anyone else with a job works for 
the Government.  Many of those employed by the Government 
in these settlements are not RADs themselves but civil 
servants on a temporary assignment. 
 
5.  Almost everyone in a RAD settlement depends upon 
state aid of some kind for subsistence.  The elderly 
receive pensions, and most receive destitute rations 
(food and clothing in kind with a small cash allowance). 
It is not uncommon for those who qualify for such 
assistance not to receive it.  The able-bodied 
occasionally find employment with the Government as 
laborers on public works projects through the Drought 
Relief Program.  The miniscule dimensions of the cash 
economy in each of these settlements require almost any 
would-be entrepreneur to target external markets.  The 
isolation of these settlements -- vehicles are scarce, 
roads are poor and tarred roads are often over an hour 
away by car -- makes selling to larger villages and towns 
difficult. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
LIVESTOCK DISTRIBUTION AN IMPERFECT SOLUTION 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. The GOB has pursued livestock-rearing as the most 
immediate solution to poverty in RAD settlements, but 
with mixed results.  Through the RADP, a family can 
receive five head of cattle or fifteen goats free of 
charge.  The Government encourages recipients not to 
slaughter any of these animals until five years has 
passed, in the hope that they will have reproduced enough 
to become a self-sustainable herd.  When owners are ready 
to sell, district councils assist them in transporting 
the animals to a Botswana Meat Commission abattoir and to 
collect payment. 
 
7.  According to a report prepared by the Ghanzi District 
Council, however, this aspect of the program has yielded 
\"very poor\" results there.  That document attributed this 
dismal performance to \"poor management, lack of 
commitment and indiscriminate slaughter of livestock.\" 
Residents of Kaudwane in Kweneng District complained to 
PolOff that lions decimated their herds and that they 
received inadequate compensation (less than half the 
replacement cost) from the Government. 
 
8. Local governments have not ignored these problems. 
The Ghanzi District Council, for example, provided 
workshops and seminars to improve livestock management 
and decided to experiment with establishing a herd in the 
name of a particular settlement.  The District currently 
manages that herd but plans eventually to turn over 
control to the community, which will own the cattle. 
The Kweneng District has assigned an animal health 
professional to reside and work in Kaudwane and has 
tasked that person with looking at ways to improve the 
productivity of goat herding there. 
 
---------------------- 
ACCESS TO LAND LIMITED 
---------------------- 
 
9. While unemployment and poverty are common nationwide -- 
recent estimates place unemployment at about 24 percent 
and the incidence of poverty at about 30 percent -- 
limited access to land exacerbates these problems in RAD 
settlements. The Government designates land for communal 
use around each settlement and allocates residential 
plots within them but has not facilitated private holding 
of farm/pasture land by RADs.  They are free to apply for 
land allocation like any other citizen, but they face 
difficulty in meeting the requirements of this process, 
including completion of application forms and preparation 
of a management plan.  Not surprisingly, land boards tend 
to favor large-scale commercial land use proposals that 
require capital inputs beyond the resources of most RADs. 
Indeed, a senior local government official told PolOff 
that he had yet to hear of a RAD acquiring his or her own 
farm.  Another indicated that the Government prefers \"to 
keep them in the settlements for now.\" 
 
10. In some areas of Botswana, land available for use by 
RADs is growing scarce.  The GOB is gradually converting 
communal land to privately held land by offering long 
term leases on concessional terms for farmers who will 
use and improve the land.  Improvement includes sinking a 
borehole and fencing the property, which, of course, 
requires capital.  Any RADs living on communal land 
reallocated to a private holder become squatters subject 
to eviction. 
 
11. Some NGOs have assisted RADs to form consortia and 
apply for leases jointly.  One organization found, 
however, that all of the groups it helped to apply that 
consisted only of San were denied, while some groups that 
included other ethnicities were approved.  This ensued 
despite the fact that they all had roughly equal 
qualifications and the same help in preparing their 
applications.  A second NGO had helped a consortium of 
three RAD settlements to secure a lease for a plot, but 
the group lacked the capital to implement its business 
plan.  Another RAD settlement had established a community 
trust which had obtained a lease but was similarly 
delayed in initiating its enterprise due to insufficient 
funds. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
ACCESS TO OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES LIMITED 
----------------------------------------- 
 
12. Access to other natural resources, such as wildlife 
products, is even more restricted.  Rights to hunt game 
are allocated through a lottery, and one must pay a fee 
to the Government based on the numbers of each type of 
animal killed.  Residents of Kaudwane and New Xade, the 
vast majority of whom were relocated there from the CKGR, 
were promised Special Game Licenses allowing them to hunt 
a limited amount of game without having to pay any fee. 
But because game was sparse in the areas surrounding 
these settlements where hunting was permitted, the 
Special Game Licenses were rarely used. 
 
13.  Entrance to the CKGR, like any other national park 
in Botswana, requires a permit obtainable only from the 
Department of Wildlife in Gaborone if the visitor intends 
to remain in the park overnight.  Hunting is prohibited 
in the CKGR, and RADs who travel into the Reserve are not 
allowed to bring out any wildlife products.  Such 
restrictions inhibit the potential for income-generating 
activities that would utilize natural resources.  An NGO 
working with RADs to produce craft products, for example, 
must import ostrich egg shells from South Africa because 
regulations do not permit collection of sufficient 
quantities locally. 
 
14. Residents of both New Xade and Kaudwane explained to 
PolOff that they had ideas for setting up eco-/cultural 
tourism enterprises.  To succeed, however, they would 
need access to some land within the CKGR due to the 
absence of game and veld food (the wide variety of plants 
that San traditionally relied upon for food, water, 
medicine, etc.) outside the Reserve.  At one point, the 
Government had considered designating areas within the 
CKGR as community use zones for just such projects.  One 
resident of New Xade told PolOff that the former Minister 
of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism subsequently had 
visited the community and told them to \"forget about\" 
that possibility and suggested setting up a \"cultural 
village\" as a tourist attraction instead.  The GOB has 
yet to issue a final master plan for land use management 
in the CKGR. 
 
--------------------------- 
DIAMOND EXPLORATION PLANNED 
--------------------------- 
 
15. No diamond mining is occurring in the CKGR at present 
but a subsidiary of BHP Billiton, Sekaka Diamonds, plans 
to conduct aerial surveys over the Reserve in 2005.  A 
poster nailed to a tree in the village of Gugamma in the 
CKGR announced that ground surveys will follow if the 
company encounters any \"interesting\" results.  Residents 
told PolOff that Sekaka representatives had visited to 
consult with them about the matter in early December. 
According to Roy Sesana, head of the First People of the 
Kalahari, the organization challenging the Government\'s 
relocation policy in court, he met with the same 
officials in November to discuss potential employment 
opportunities for those who live in the reserve in 
conjunction with such exploration. 
 
16. This is not, however, a \"smoking gun\" demonstrating 
that the Government displaced people to obtain mining 
profits.  The Reserve encompasses enough territory to 
accommodate a mine in one area, residents in another, and 
protected wildlife elsewhere.  Diamond exploration 
licenses cover much of the Botswana\'s land area, not just 
the CKGR.  While previous surveys and mining attempts 
determined that the ore in the Reserve was not economical 
to extract, technological advances have made renewed 
exploration worthwhile. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
VOCATIONAL TRAINING MAKES LITTLE HEADWAY 
---------------------------------------- 
 
17. Lack of marketable skills also contributes to poverty 
and unemployment among RADs.  The GOB offers RADs 
vocational training free of charge and seed capital to 
return to one\'s settlement and begin a small business. 
RADP officers complained, however, that few RADs take 
advantage of this opportunity.  Many of those who start 
such training abandon it.  Visits by PolOff to several 
RAD settlements found no one who had derived a regular 
income from skills acquired through this program. 
Several had started working, only to fold after a few 
months, usually, but not always, due to a lack of 
clients.  In one instance, a sewing and knitting project 
was offered the opportunity to supply garments to the 
local school, but the artisans simply did not want to 
produce the volume of garments the school would require. 
 
Absent success in forming their own businesses, the RADs\' 
best job prospects to counter this culture of despair and 
dependency may lie in finding employment in towns. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE SUBSTANTIAL BUT TROUBLED 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
18. Local government interlocutors generally pointed to 
formal education as the ultimate key to development among 
RADs.  Residents of RAD settlements likewise emphasized 
to PolOff the importance of education and their 
appreciation of the Government\'s assistance in that 
regard.  The Government has established primary schools 
in almost every RAD settlement and pre-schools in many of 
them.  RAD children pay no school fees, eat two meals a 
day at school, and receive uniforms for free.  The 
Government also bears the expense of sending children to 
boarding school for secondary education, including costs 
of transportation and pocket money for the students. 
 
19. These benefits not withstanding, the educational 
aspect of the RADP faces problems.  In Ghanzi District, 
thousands of RADs live on private farms, either as 
workers or squatters.  Children of these individuals, as 
well as of the few remaining residents of the CKGR, must 
live in hostels located in villages with schools from a 
young age.  The fact that instruction is in Setswana and 
English after pre-school and not in the mother tongue 
discourages some students.  Additionally, different 
practices regarding disciplinary customs - San typically 
do not use corporal punishment, whereas paddling is a 
common practice in Botswana\'s public schools - and 
prejudice against San children make school a difficult 
environment for some RAD children.  Thus, truancy is 
high. 
 
------------------------- 
CULTURAL OBSTACLES ABOUND 
------------------------- 
 
20. Prejudice against San remains widespread.  PolOff 
encountered assertions that they could not \"think for 
themselves,\" did not teach their children right from 
wrong, or did not value education.  Officials frequently 
emphasized the need for the Government to patiently guide 
RADs in the process of development.  One official 
described the GOB\'s objective as instilling a \"cattle- 
rearing culture\" in RADs.  A resident of New Xade 
confirmed this effect of the RADP, telling PolOff that 
the migration from the CKGR entailed adoption of the 
culture of \"the rest of Botswana\" and the loss of the 
traditions practiced by his parents. 
 
21. Residents of RAD settlements and members of NGOs who 
worked with them pointed to a number of cultural 
obstacles to development among RADs themselves.  RADs 
relocated in New Xade and Kaudwane grew up largely in a 
hunter-gatherer lifestyle.  Thus, some find the idea of 
working all day on the same (sometimes monotonous task) 
unacceptable, as in the case of sewers and knitters noted 
above.  Some interlocutors described a spirit of despair 
and dependence that dominated the atmosphere of these 
locations.  According to these contacts, RADs tended to 
assume that a significant improvement in their situation 
was not possible or thought that any such change could 
only come from the Government or an NGO.  Participation 
in different income generation programs, as a result, was 
low.  The prevalence of alcoholism further undermined 
hope for progress. 
 
22. Historically, San organized themselves into family 
groups.  With no chiefs, they are unrepresented on 
Botswana\'s Council of Chiefs, where other Batswana groups 
have a voice.  The Government has instituted the practice 
of appointing headmen in the RAD settlements, but no 
overarching leadership has emerged to promote RAD 
interests in Botswana\'s narrowly constructed political 
arena. 
 
--------------------------- 
HIV-AIDS IN RAD SETTLEMENTS 
--------------------------- 
 
23.  Although the isolation of RAD settlement might 
afford some measure of protection from HIV-AIDS, the 
disease remains a problem nevertheless.  The headman in 
Kaudwane noted to PolOff that the construction teams 
working on roads and buildings in the settlement 
contributed to its spread there.  Services related to HIV- 
AIDS, such as counselling, testing, and treatment are not 
 
as readily-available to RADs as to other Batswana.  They 
must often travel long distances just to test, and this 
deters many from bothering.  Keeping down the HIV-AIDS 
rate in remote settings will be necessary to boost 
economic development in those areas. 
 
----------------------------- 
RADS GENERALLY PRO-GOVERNMENT 
----------------------------- 
 
24.  The bleak situation in RAD settlements has not 
translated into resentment toward the state or the ruling 
party.  Interlocutors in these places generally observed 
that while the GOB had not done all it could, or even all 
that it had promised, it was not neglecting them.  Some 
expressed frustration with policies limiting access to 
the CKGR as fatally undermining the best prospects for 
income generation in these settlements.  Others faulted 
the Government for not providing infrastructural 
improvements it had promised.  These criticisms revealed 
a general consensus that the Government was doing the 
right things, but not rapidly enough or with sufficient 
resources. 
 
25.  A vocal minority dismissed these concerns as 
secondary to the fundamental issue of land rights.  They 
argued that resettlement from the CKGR wrongfully 
alienated them from their ancestral territory.  The 
election in New Xade and Kaudwane, where animosity toward 
the GOB over the relocation policy runs highest, of 
district councillors from the ruling BDP, illustrates the 
general perception among most RADs that the Government is 
an imperfect ally, not an enemy. 
 
26. Conversations with residents of New Xade and 
Kaudwane, to which former residents of the CKGR were 
resettled, indicate that only a minority wish to return. 
A small number of San are trickling back into the 
Reserve.  If the First People of the Kalahari were to win 
its court case and secure restoration of basic public 
services, most notably the provision of water, others 
probably would join them.  A number of those who had left 
the CKGR suggested to PolOff, however, that any returnees 
would consist primarily of the elderly, especially those 
relocated in 2002.  Only a minority of those relocated 
before 2002 appear to be interested in living in the 
Reserve. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
27. Contrary to the rhetoric of some critics, the GOB is 
not perpetrating genocide against the San or other RADs. 
The Government\'s efforts have focused on improving the 
standard of living for the RADs.  While programs may have 
been under-funded and the results sketchy, district 
councils are trying new approaches to improve outcomes. 
Many of the problems plaguing RADs -- HIV/AIDS, 
unemployment, loss of livestock to predators -- afflict 
all rural Batswana, not just RADs.  Prejudice against the 
San, while common, has not precluded meaningful 
assistance from the Government. 
 
28. Enhancing access to natural resources, especially 
land, is key to further improvement in the living 
conditions of RADs.  With the Government open to the idea 
of diamond mining within the CKGR, it might also consider 
controlled use of parts of the Reserve by its former and 
current residents for enterprises in the tourism. 
 
29.  Sustained improvement of the RADP would require 
political leadership that could credibly represent RADs 
in negotiation with the Government.  First People of the 
Kalahari foreclosed the possibility of playing this role 
when it internationalised its dispute with the 
Government.  Less confrontational organizations that work 
with RADs, such as Permaculture Trust, Kuru Trust and the 
Botswana Center for Human Rights might be able to lobby 
more effectively should they choose to do so. 
 
30.  One solution posited by RADS to assure more 
effective representation is to form a San Council. 
Embassy received a Democracy and Human Rights Fund 
proposal in 2004 from the Kuru Trust to assist in the 
formation of such a council, but the proposal lacked 
details.  In an early December visit to Shakawe, DCM 
asked the Kuru Trust to focus and resubmit its proposal 
so that the Embassy would be better able to evaluate it. 
With the RADs in a single organization, the Government 
would have a stronger partner for discussion. 
 
31.  Support for mother-tongue education could help 
preserve San culture and, in the long term, cultivate 
leadership indigenous to RAD communities.  Kuru Trust has 
requested assistance from Debswana to set up two such 
schools to cater for RADs.  Although the linguistic 
diversity among San would pose an obstacle, this effort 
could decrease truancy rates, counter the effects of 
prejudice, and provide focal points for community 
organization, all leading to a brighter future for RADS.

SUBJECT: PORTRAIT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AS AN AUTOCRAT: 
CRITICS QUESTION KHAMA\'S DEMOCRATIC CREDENTIALS 
 
REF: A. (A) GABORONE 1873 
 
     B. (B) GABORONE 1950 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOSEPH HUGGINS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  As next in line to inherit the presidency, 
Botswana,s Vice President Ian Khama remains an enigma.  Many 
participants in Botswana\'s public life such as academics, 
journalists, and NGO leaders, express ambiguity and 
skepticism regarding the Vice President\'s credentials as a 
politician and worry about his views on issues such as human 
rights and press freedom.  Khama is perceived, and frequently 
portrayed in local newspapers, as an autocrat: 
intolerant of criticism and eager to bring opponents to heel. 
The broad powers Botswana\'s constitution accords to the 
presidency and a tradition of strong centralization 
administered by a ruling elite that fully exploits these 
powers suggest that Khama,s ascendancy will not shock the 
political system.  While Khama\'s assumption of the presidency 
might not facilitate the further development of democratic 
institutions and practices in Botswana, it is unlikely to 
significantly reverse the progress democracy has made here. 
Nonetheless, in the wake of the October 2004 election, the 
Botswana atmospherics are full of 
speculation as to what an Ian Khama presidency would bring. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
STRAINED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIA 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U)  A major theme in the public discussion is that the 
Vice President has done little to cultivate a favorable image 
with the press.  Journalists generally depict Khama as their 
antagonist.  His alleged distrust of the media is reflected 
in his infrequent interviews or comments to the press.  While 
the low professional standards that dominate  Botswana\'s 
media sector would make any public figure wary of speaking 
out, his reticence arguably intensifies his 
misrepresentation in the media. Journalists defend their 
reporting of hearsay about Khama as fact due to the dearth of 
reliable information and his inaccessibility to the press. 
Consequently, apart from photo-ops, coverage of the Vice 
President tends to be one-sided, with journalists frequently 
attributing the worst motives to his actions and not 
articulating his side of a story. In response, Khama has 
accused the media of bias against the ruling Botswana 
Democratic Party (BDP).  The Office of the President has 
pitched in, issuing statements designed to clarify incidents 
involving the Vice President partially reported in the 
private media, and pointedly questioning the intentions and 
integrity of the concerned publications.  But, in short, the 
Vice President has a public relations problem, which is not 
being effectively addressed. 
 
3. (C)  Multiple contacts described the Vice President as 
opposed to an independent, critical media.  They attribute 
the change of stance by former Minister of Communications, 
Science and Technology, Boyce Sebetela, toward the media as 
due to the Vice President,s influence.  When Sebetela took 
office in 2002, they said he demonstrated a willingness to 
listen to and accommodate journalists\' concerns.  Almost 
overnight he reversed course, allegedly after being reined in 
by the Office of the President, with Vice President Khama as 
the driving force.  Sebetela has attempted to disassociate 
himself with some controversial decisions, asserting that he 
simply implemented the will of the 
cabinet.  Nor did our interlocutors expect a change of 
direction with the appointment of the new minister, Ms. 
Pelonomi Venson. They expect that free press skeptics in the 
cabinet, led by the Vice President, will align her against 
the media as well. 
 
4. (C) Past attempts by the Government to manipulate the 
press have contributed to Khama\'s unfavorable media image. 
In 2001, the Office of the President instructed all 
government departments and parastatals to discontinue the 
purchase of advertising space in the privately-owned Botswana 
Guardian and Midweek Sun newspapers.  Vice President Khama 
reportedly inspired this decision, which was prompted by the 
papers\' criticisms of the Government.  (The 
High Court later overruled the prohibition.)  That same year, 
he was also reported to have intervened to prevent Botswana 
Television from airing a documentary on a murderer executed 
in Botswana.  These incidents suggest a 
willingness to employ heavy-handed measures to silence voices 
of dissent in the media. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
A SOLDIER, NOT A HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C)  Vice President Khama\'s views on human rights are 
unclear.  When asked their perception of his attitude toward 
these issues, three interlocutors at University of Botswana\'s 
Department of Government and Public Administration were left 
bemused.  The reaction of the leader of Botswana\'s main human 
rights organization was that Khama just \"is not a human 
rights person.\"  While he has 
never dismissed the importance of human rights, and while he 
is patron of a number of charitable organizations, the Vice 
President thus far has not come out as a strong proponent. 
It may be too much to expect him to speak out about human 
rights abuses taking place in neighboring Zimbabwe, specially 
in view of the GOB,s almost total silence with regard to 
this issue.  As a former Botswana Defense Force commander, 
Khama is known to have strong sympathies with 
his Zimbabwean army counterparts, which may inhibit him from 
facing up to the wretched realities across the border. 
 
6. (C)  The Vice President has made several clumsy remarks 
concerning women, which at least raise questions regarding 
his commitment or sensitivity to gender equality -- and of 
the capabilities of his public relations staff.  On at least 
three separate occasions during the 2004 electoral campaign, 
Khama made speeches in which he dismissed or denigrated women 
and their role in politics. Dr. Gloria Somolekae, a former 
professor of politics, who now heads Botswana,s Vision 2016 
Commission and who is well connected within the ruling elite, 
characterized these as lapses of judgment in which Khama used 
humor appropriate for private settings in public fora.  She 
did not believe, however, that these incidents necessarily 
boded ill for the role of women in a Khama administration. 
The head of Botswana Women\'s NGO Coalition was similarly 
ambiguous, telling PolOff that Khama had not made it clear 
what priority he assigns to women\'s rights. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
BROUGHT IN TO UNIFY THE BDP: LOW TOLERANCE FOR DISSENT 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7. (C)  Vice President Khama apparently has little patience 
for dissent or criticism.  One interlocutor reported to 
PolOff a conversation with Minister of Communications, 
Science and Technology Pelonomi Venson in which she remarked 
that no one in the cabinet dared voice disagreement with the 
Vice President except for President Mogae himself.  Members 
of the BDP -- primarily from the Kedikilwe faction -- have 
echoed this sentiment, suggesting that party members already 
fear crossing the Vice President and doubt whether they will 
retain the ability to speak freely in a post-Mogae scenario. 
This may well be due to the fact that the Vice President was 
brought into BDP politics from the military in 1998 with the 
specific dual mandate of lending the Khama luster to the 
party and of being the enforcer: ensuring that ministries got 
their deliverables out in time.  Khama,s career experience 
can be described as long on commanding; 
short on the give-and-take of political accommodation. 
 
8. (C)  Dr. Somolekae, a sympathetic observer, confirmed 
Khama\'s dual mandate. She opined that Khama has had 
difficulty transitioning from a military to a political mode. 
She saw him as focused on delivering desired outcomes more 
than on building and maintaining consensus.  While this 
approach could increase productivity in Botswana\'s lethargic 
bureaucracy, it could also short-circuit constructive 
dialogue and undermine checks on government power.

RIVALS SIDELINED -- FOR NOW 
--------------------------- 
 
9. (C)  The 2004 general election process confirmed to many 
observers Khama\'s intolerance of dissent in any form.  The 
BDP\'s primary election process was troubled, and in several 
constituencies re-runs resulted in an altered outcome.  Dr. 
Somolekae\'s close ties to President Mogae and other BDP 
leaders notwithstanding, she described the primaries as \"Moi 
elections,\" blatantly stolen, in her opinion, by members of 
the Mogae/Khama faction.  News reports alleging that ballots 
were only cast a second time in constituencies where a 
candidate from the Khama faction had lost, confirm that this 
impression -- of sham primaries -- is commonly shared. 
 
10. (U)  After the October 30 2004 general election, members 
of the rival faction led by MP Ponatshego Kedikilwe were 
almost entirely excluded from cabinet and council 
nominations, despite the group\'s considerable numbers in 
parliament (Ref A).  Despite gaining 48 percent of the 
popular vote, opposition parties accounted for only 3 of 101 
 
 
nominated seats in local councils, which are appointed by the 
central government.  The independent press interpreted the 
appointment of three novice politicians with military 
backgrounds to the cabinet as an indication that Khama places 
a premium on obedience and loyalty over experience and 
talent.  It should be noted that the three new cabinet 
officials come to their jobs with considerable private sector 
experience. Reports that the Vice President is looking into 
abolishing the long-standing caucus of BDP backbench MPs, 
which have been among his most outspoken critics of late, 
reinforced perceptions that Khama\'s top priority is a BDP 
that speaks with one voice, and, thus, silences dissent. 
 
------------------------------------ 
ARBITRARY PRIVILEGES: ABOVE THE LAW? 
------------------------------------ 
 
11. (U)  Critics accuse Vice President Khama of acting as 
though he were above the law.  The incident that rankles most 
is the GOB aircraft saga.  In April 2001, the Ombudsman 
advised President Mogae that Vice President Khama should not 
pilot Botswana Defense Force (BDF) aircraft because, as a 
civilian, the BDF could not hold him accountable for loss or 
damage.  Instead, Mogae praised Khama\'s skills as an airman 
and the Vice President continued to fly himself around the 
country, including  campaign events in BDF aircraft. As much 
to the point was that Khama,s airborne mobility gave him an 
instant advantage over opposition parties, campaigning.  GOB 
personnel continued to accompany him to political party 
events despite complaints about that practice as well. 
 
12. (U)  In the press, the continuing controversy regarding 
the location of the prospective second university is 
unfolding as a commentary on the governing style of the Vice 
President (Ref B).  On December 10, MPs from the Mogae/Khama 
faction of the BDP rallied to defeat a motion to investigate 
the determination to locate the institution in 
Serowe-Palapye, arguing that the legislature had no right to 
revisit the executive\'s decision. (The commission appointed 
to recommend the location of the second university had 
selected the town of Selebi-Phikwe, but was overruled by 
cabinet).  Members of the rival BDP faction led by Ponatshego 
Kedikilwe, along with the opposition sponsor of the motion, 
walked out in protest.  In subsequent press reports, 
Kedikilwe and MP Daniel Kwelagobe articulated apprehension at 
the implications for a balance of power 
between the executive and legislature.  One BDP member 
asserted in frustration that the dominant Mogae/Khama faction 
was \"killing democracy.\"

COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (C) None of the speculations about Khama,s inflexibility 
should be interpreted as a threat to Botswana,s democratic 
institutions.  Indeed, the current, very public, discussion 
about the Vice President\'s nature, talents, and inclinations, 
is testimony to the vibrancy of Botswana,s democracy -- and 
of the country\'s talent for planning ahead.  As son of the 
first president of the country, Vice President Khama is 
heaped to the point of overload with expectations, and is 
bound in consequence to disappoint at least a part of 
the public.  The contitution provides for a powerful chief 
executiveand the country\'s political culture has tolerated 
decisive, not to say autocratic, tendencies in it 
presidents.  Botswana prides itself on the stablity of its 
democratic institutions, but most of hem are dominated by a 
small elite.  If Khama is perceived as more autocratic than 
his predecessors, the difference is one of degree, not of 
substance.  Consequently, it is most unlikely that Khama\'s 
ascendance will derail democracy in Botswana.  It may well 
enhance it, as Botswana\'s political parties, parliament, and 
other institutions will have to reassess their role and 
define themselves against a more assertive personality.
