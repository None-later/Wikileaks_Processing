INVOLVEMENT. 
 
2.  \"ESTADO\'S\" DEFENSE EDITOR ROBERTO GODOY WROTE 
ABOUT ALLEGED U.S. ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN HAWK 
MISSILES FROM BRAZIL IN 1986, AN UNUSUAL REQUEST, 
ACCORDING TO GODOY, FOR BRAZIL DOES NOT HAVE SUCH 
SYSTEM IN ITS INVENTORY.  THE FIRST CONTACT, GODOY 
SAID, WAS MADE IN EARLY 1986 BY AN \"ADVISOR\" TO H. 
ROSS PEROT TO A LOCAL ARMS PRODUCER, AND THE 
SECOND IN MAY, TO A FORMER MEMBER OF THE BRAZILIAN 
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL INVOLVED WITH THE ARMS 
INDUSTRY.  GODOY EXPLAINED THAT THE AMERICAN 
PROPOSED TO TRADE HAWKS FOR THE MORE ADVANCED 
SPARROW, NOT SPECIFYING WHERE THE WEAPONS WOULD 
GO.  IN BOTH INSTANCES, HE CONTINUED, THE AMERICAN 
WAS TURNED DOWN BECAUSE THE BRAZILIANS SUSPECTED 
THE CONTRAS OR IRAN AS RECIPIENTS AND SAID 
GOVERNMENT RULES WOULD NOT ALLOW SUCH \"NEBULOUS\" 
TRANSFERS OR SALES TO A NATION AT WAR.  GODOY ALSO 
REFERRED TO JAIRO IWAMASSA GUINOZA\'S CONNECTION 
(SEE REFTEL A) RESTATING THAT GUINOZA WAS NEVER 
ABLE TO PURCHASE ANY ARMS FROM BRAZILIAN 
MANUFACTURERS. 
 
3.  \"VEJA\'S\" STORY CLAIMS TO PRESENT \"PROOF\" OF 
BRAZILIAN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CONTRAS AND IRAN, 
BUT IT IS SHORT ON EVIDENCE AND SOURCES.  ONE OF 
THE \"PROOFS\" IS A RECENT PHOTOGRAPH OF FIVE BOXES 
OF HAND GRENADES MADE BY COMPANHIA DE EXPLOSIVOS 
VALPARAIBA IN SAO PAULO.  ACCORDING TO THE 
ARTICLE, THE GRENADES WERE SHIPPED TO SRI LANKA IN 
1984 AND IT SPECULATES THAT SOME OF THEM WERE 
DIVERTED TO HONDURAS FROM SOUTH AFRICA, A PORT 
STOP ALONG THE WAY.  \"VEJA\" DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY 
CONTRABAND WEAPONS ENDED UP IN THE CONTRA\'S 
TRAINING CAMP, NOR THE SIZE OF THE ORIGINAL 
SHIPMENT TO COLOMBO, BUT SUGGESTS THAT THE 
TRANSFER WAS MADE WITH THE CONSENT OF THE BUYER, 
FOR SRI LANKA DID NOT PROTEST THE INCOMPLETE 
SHIPMENT.  ANOTHER \"PROOF\" WAS FINDING TWO 
HONDURAN AIR FORCE OFFICERS TRAINING AT EMBRAER 
ALSO IN 1984.  HONDURAS HAD SIGNED A US DOLS 10 
MILLION CONTRACT \"FINANCED BY RONALD REAGAN\'S 
GOVERNMENT\" FOR THE PURCHASE OF TUCANOS.  IN 
\"VEJA\'S\" OPINION, NICARAGUA NOW HAS EVIDENCE TO 
MAKE A CLAIM FROM ITAMARATY ON BRAZIL\'S SUPPORT TO 
NICARAGUA\'S FOES. 
 
4. (U) \"VEJA\" ALSO REHASHES THE STORY OF U.S. 
CITIZEN GEORGE PERRY\'S DEATH IN 1983 IN NEW YORK. 
SUPPOSEDLY PERRY WAS KILLED BECAUSE HE DIDN\'T 
FULFILL HIS PART ON A US DOLS 20 MILLION DEAL TO 
DELIVER ARMS TO IRAN, AND THE GOB\'S VISA REFUSAL 
FOR THE U.S. INVESTIGATOR OF THE CRIME.  IN 
ADDITION, VARIOUS ATTEMPTS AT SHADY SALES TO 
AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST IN THE EARLY 80\'S ARE 
DESCRIBED. THE STORY ENDS WITH THE UNDOCUMENTED 
ASSERTION THAT IRAN PURCHASED IN 1983 US DOLS 500 
MILLION WORTH OF \"EXPLOSIVES\" AND THAT SINCE THEN 
THE GOB HAS \"TENDED TO IRAN\'S REQUESTS\" INCLUDING 
SENDING A \"PLANE LOAD OF ARMS\" LAST WEEK. 
 
5.  (LOU) COMMENT:  THE BRAZILIAN PRESS IS 
SEARCHING FOR BRAZILIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
US/IRAN/CONTRA ARMS TRAFFIC BUT SO FAR THE 
EVIDENCE IS NOT CONVINCING.  MOST OF THE INSTANCES 
CITED BY THE PRESS OCCURRED A FEW YEARS BEFORE THE 
U.S. BEGAN ITS SECRET CONTACTS.  ATTEMPTS AT SALES 
MUST HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN MADE INDEPENDENT OF U.S. 
EFFORTS.  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, \"JORNAL DO 
BRASIL\" REPORTED IN JUNE 1984 NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE 
SALE OF ONE MILLION GRENADES TO A SUBSIDIARY OF 
THE VALPARAIBA COMPANY MENTIONED ABOVE.  ENOUGH 
TALES OF INTRIGUE AND POTENTIALLY EMBARRASSING 
SHADY ARMS DEALS MIGHT MAKE THE GOB CONSIDER THE 
ADVANTAGES OF REQUIRING A NON-TRANSFER TO THIRD 
PARTIES CLAUSE IN THEIR ARMS SALES CONTRACTS, A 
REQUIREMENT NOT INCLUDED IN THEIR CURRENT ARMS 
SALES POLICY GUIDELINES (SEE REFTEL B).

SUBJECT: A/S REICH\'S MEETING WITH LULA 
 
Classified By: POLOFF RICHARD REITER FOR REASONS 1.5(b) AND (d). 
 
1.(C) SUMMARY. Assistant Secretary Reich had warm and 
productive meetings in Brasilia November 20-21 with 
President-elect Lula da Silva, his senior advisors in the PT, 
and Brazilian congressional leaders.  Both Ambassador Reich 
and Lula expressed great interest in working together across 
a range of issues, particularly trade.  The PT team floated 
the idea of concluding a bilateral trade pact with the US, 
but will first consult with their Mercosul partners and then 
likely raise some proposals during Lula\'s December 10 visit 
to Washington.  Lula is eager to meet President Bush, sure 
that \"two politicians like us will understand each other when 
we meet face to face.\"  In keeping with efforts by Lula to 
distance himself from Castro and Hugo Chavez, PT leader 
Aloizio Mercadante sought to downplay his participation in 
the \"Sao Paulo Forum\" as an attempt to set a democratic 
example for other Latin American leftists.  Ambassador Reich 
also met with Brazilian congressional leaders, who similarly 
expressed eagerness to strengthen ties with the US in order 
to help address pressing economic and social needs.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
RELATIONSHIP OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT 
---------------------------------- 
2. (C) WHA Assistant Secretary Otto Reich led a delegation to 
Brasilia November 20-21 that included WHA/BSC Director James 
Carragher, Special Advisor William Perry, and Michael Zarin 
of S/P.  The group, accompanied by Ambassador Hrinak and 
Poloff (notetaker), met November 21 with President-elect Lula 
da Silva and his three senior advisors: Jose Dirceu, Workers\' 
Party (PT) President and Federal Deputy from Sao Paulo; 
Aloizio Mercadante, PT Federal Deputy and Senator-elect from 
Sao Paulo; and Antonio Palocci, who resigned this week as 
mayor of Riberao Preto (SP) to devote full time to leading 
Lula\'s transition team.  All three will have high profile 
positions in the new government. 
 
3. (C) The messages on both sides were extremely positive. 
Before Lula joined the meeting, Jose Dirceu expressed the 
interest of the incoming government in strengthening 
Brazil/US ties.  He said the December 10 visit by Lula to 
Washington should focus on items on both countries\' agendas, 
including FTAA and free trade, protectionism, terrorism, and 
the possibility of war in Iraq, which would have economic 
consequences for Brazil. 
 
LET\'S GET BEYOND THE HEADLINES 
------------------------------ 
4. (C) Assistant Secretary Reich commented that even after 
9/11 the US will continue to pursue a range of interests 
(commercial, economic, political, security) in the 
hemisphere.  President Bush\'s phone call to Lula after the 
Brazilian elections and invitation to the White House are 
strong signals of the USG\'s desire to strengthen ties to 
Brazil under Lula.  The message, Reich emphasized, is that 
the US and the incoming Brazilian government need to get 
beyond any preconceptions we may have had about each other 
and focus on things that bring us together.  The media often 
highlight policy differences, he added, but it is President 
Bush who sets the USG\'s direction, and he wants to strengthen 
the US/Brazil relationship.  Reich also reviewed the US 
position on Iraq, noting that there would not have been the 
current need to force compliance if Saddam Hussein had 
complied with the sixteen UN resolutions since 1991. 
 
BILATERAL TRADE PACT ON THE HORIZON? 
------------------------------------ 
5. (C) Commenting on Mercadante\'s remark to D/USTR Peter 
Allgeier the day before that the US seems unwilling to 
negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with Brazil, Reich said 
the US was flexible on the best approach to free trade but 
that his impression was that Brazil was not interested in 
such a bilateral pact.  Mercadante noted that Mercosul 
partners Argentina and Uruguay are currently in crisis, which 
has scared foreign investors throughout South America.  Thus 
Brazil\'s two highest priorities with the US are: obtaining US 
support in gaining increased access to commercial credit (and 
demonstrating that Brazil is a better risk than Argentina); 
and secondly, to increase foreign trade, and particularly to 
double trade with the US in the next four years.  How, 
Mercadante asked, can the US/Brazilian trade total only $30 
billion per year? 
 
6. (C) Mercadante urged that the US and Brazil sit down to 
discuss a range of bilateral trade issues, for example, IPR 
and music piracy, ethanol sales, and aircraft exports.  He 
added that FTAA (\"ALCA\" in Portuguese) will be a much more 
difficult project, but that the bilateral talks could start 
immediately.  Reflecting the PT\'s dedication to regional 
partners, Mercadante urged that the US seek a trade pact with 
Mercosul.  Ambassador Reich said he was pleased to hear of 
Mercadante\'s interest in such talks, noting that the US is 
open to bilateral pacts (e.g., Chile) as well as pacts with 
sub-regional groups (e.g. the Central American states). 
 
7. (C) Ambassador Hrinak asked Mercadante if Lula would be 
extending an invitation to bilateral talks during the 
Washington visit.  Jose Dirceu answered before Mercadante 
could, saying that the bilateral talks were important but 
would have to be approached in the context of Brazil\'s 
regional commitments.  Dirceu admitted that the incoming 
government would like to conclude a bilateral pact quickly, 
but as Brazil is the only stable economic force in South 
America, they would have to proceed cautiously and in concert 
with regional partners.  Mercadante said that Lula will 
travel to Argentina on December 3, and then there will be a 
December 5-6 meeting of Mercosul presidents in Brasilia. 
Lula would use these opportunities to sound out the Mercosul 
partners on future negotiating mechanisms --for example a 
Mercosul 4 1 with the US.  After these talks, Mercadante 
said, it is possible Lula would arrive in Washington with 
\"some initiatives\".  Dirceu summed up by noting that while 
Brazil must consult its regional partners, it \"does not want 
to be held hostage by them.\" 
 
LULA WANTS STRONG TIES AND TOUGH NEGOTIATING 
-------------------------------------------- 
8. (C)  President-elect Lula then joined the meeting and 
enthusiastically stated his interest in strong bilateral 
relations across the range of issues.  That, he said, is what 
is motivating him to travel to Washington on December 10. 
Appearing upbeat, smartly-dressed and rested, Lula expressed 
hope that after his visit, US officials will no longer 
misunderstand the PT.  Looking forward to meeting President 
Bush, he said \"I think two politicians like us will 
understand each other when we meet face to face.\"  Brazil\'s 
image has suffered in recent years, he said, and the PT wants 
to consolidate its democracy and rescue it from the 
perception that Brazilian officials are a \"bunch of 
irresponsible thieves\" and \"Brazil is another Colombia.\" 
 
9. (C) The PT has the sense that Brazil can play an important 
role but can only reach its potential in cooperation with the 
US.  In a left jab at the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, Lula 
echoed remarks that he has made in public: \"I want to do for 
Brazilians what you US diplomats do for your citizens --fight 
for their interests.  But I think Brazilian diplomacy has not 
been tough enough, not like yours.  We have sometimes made 
bad deals.\"  Dirceu added that the Brazilian government is 
committed to abiding by all agreements that it inherits, \"We 
do not need any more headaches\" that we would get by breaking 
deals, he said.  The PT team has emphasized its interest in 
negotiating FTAA with the US, but doing so by vigorously 
defending Brazil\'s interests.  After the meeting, Mercadante 
told the press. \"The Americans always played tough, and now 
they have a Brazilian administration that is going to play as 
tough as they do.\" 
 
\"WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE PT\" 
----------------------------- 
10. (C) Ambassador Reich congratulated Lula on his election 
victory, adding that his own visit was designed to follow up 
on President Bush\'s post-election phone call and lay the 
groundwork for the December 10 visit.  Ambassador Reich 
expressed support for Lula\'s social agenda (\"Your commitment 
to three meals a day for every Brazilian is something that 
all Americans will want to support.\"), adding that 
democratization, human rights, economic progress, and 
transparency are key issues for the US public and policy 
makers.  Reich concluded, \"We are not afraid of the PT and 
its social agenda\". 
 
PALOCCI\'S ECONOMIC MESSAGE:  CREDIT, CREDIT, CREDIT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
11. (C) After Lula was called away, Transition Director 
Antonio Palocci picked up on the economic themes.  He stated 
unequivocally that the PT government will focus on combating 
inflation and working smoothly with the IFIs.  Modifying 
Mercadante\'s two priorities a bit, Palocci said Lula would 
take two messages to Washington.  First, that Brazil really 
has three short-term priorities: credit, credit, and credit; 
and second, that Brazil will seek clear understandings and 
strong relations with the US in order to develop and grow. 
 
12. (C) Ambassador Reich observed that the USG does not 
direct banks to extend credit, but that the Brazilians 
themselves were doing the right things to gain access to 
loans.  Reich noted that \"since the elections you have been 
sending the right messages\", adding that Brazilian/US 
cooperation will reinforce these messages by conveying to the 
financial markets US confidence in Brazil\'s economy. 
 
\"THE PT IS A MODEL FOR LATIN AMERICAN LEFTISTS\" 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
13. (C) Ambassador Reich asked Mercadante about the \"Sao 
Paulo Forum\", which Mercadante has addressed and which has 
included FARC and Cuban participants, among others. 
Mercadante downplayed the PT\'s work in the Forum, explaining 
that his primary interest is in developing the left in Latin 
America, and that many of the participants in the Forum are 
unreconstructed \"outdated\" leftists who can learn a lot from 
the PT\'s democratic model and emphasis on economic 
development.  He added that the Forum had issued a 
declaration after 9/11 condemning the terrorist attacks and 
defending the right of the US to respond in self-defense. 
\"We are democratic,\" Mercadante assured us, \"Washington needs 
to hear our ideas and our arguments.\" 
 
14. (C) On Colombia, Dirceu said that the FARC needs to 
understand that if they cross into Brazilian territory, 
Lula\'s government will use the military and \"treat them as 
enemies.\"  He added that groups such as the FARC that operate 
outside of democratic processes \"do not interest us\".  After 
Ambassador Reich outlined the range of human rights concerns 
in Cuba, Dirceu responded that \"the strongest force in the 
world for changing Cuba is US trade\", but he concluded that 
\"we will simply have to agree to disagree\" on Cuba policy. 
 
WASHINGTON AGENDA 
----------------- 
15. (C)  Mercadante said that he will accompany Lula to 
Washington.  The rest of the travel team has not been 
decided, and the agenda will be finalized only after 
consultations with the Brazilian embassy in Washington, 
though Ambassador Barbosa has been consulting in Brasilia 
this week. 
 
INAUGURATION LIKELY JANUARY 1 
----------------------------- 
16. (C)  In response to a question from Ambassador Reich, 
Dirceu stated that the inauguration will be on January 1. 
(N.b., Dirceu himself was a big proponent of moving the date 
to January 6 and had been urging his congressional colleagues 
to take quick action on the required constitutional 
amendment, so his statement on the January 1 date may well be 
the last word.)  Minister Pedro Parente, head of the outgoing 
administration\'s transition team, also told us November 21 
that the inauguration would be January 1. 
 
CONGRESSIONAL MEETINGS 
---------------------- 
17. (C) Earlier, Ambassador Reich\'s group met with outgoing 
Chamber Speaker and PSDB leader Aecio Neves and separately 
with PT Senate leader Eduardo Suplicy from Sao Paulo and PT 
Deputy Waldir Pires from Bahia.  Neves, who will take over as 
Governor of Minas Gerais in January, focused his remarks on 
Brazil\'s economic plight.  He noted that he had supported the 
economic plan of President Cardoso, which had prevented 
Brazil from suffering the same fate as Argentina.  He also 
stressed that the PSDB and other opposition parties expect to 
support many of Lula\'s initiatives.  Suplicy stressed the 
importance of President Bush\'s understanding the Brazilian 
democratic process and the fact that Lula\'s 61% electoral 
support demonstrated that he has overwhelming legitimacy to 
address social and economic issues.  Both Suplicy and Pires 
spoke at length on the importance of addressing Brazil\'s deep 
social inequities.  Suplicy added that Lula may be a useful 
bridge in improving US relations with Cuba, to which 
Ambassador Reich replied that relations will improve as soon 
as Castro holds free elections. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
18. (C)  Lula and the senior PT officials are clearly eager 
to get down to work with us, and this visit went a long way 
toward reassuring them that the feeling is mutual.  Though 
they have not yet thought through their floater for bilateral 
trade talks, we can expect some sort of proposal in 
Washington, after they have consulted more deeply with their 
Mercosul partners as well as internally. 
 
19. (C) The PT leaders have contrasting and complementary 
personalities.  Mercadante\'s former radicalism lies not far 
from the surface.  He speaks to convince rather than explain, 
often pointing a finger at his listeners.  Yet he is 
courteous and clearly focused on specific bilateral projects. 
 Dirceu is much smoother.  He never corrected Mercadante but 
sometimes stepped in to qualify his remarks.  Dirceu seems to 
be the first among equals and is rumored to become Lula\'s 
Chief-of-Staff if he does not stay in Congress to become the 
Speaker of the Chamber.  Palocci, whose star has risen 
rapidly in recent months, is perhaps the most pragmatic of 
the group.  He speaks slowly and calmly --often about 
economic issues-- clearly aware of the effect of his words. 
His is a voice seemingly designed to reassure the markets. 
In a November 21 meeting with U/S Larson (septel), Cardoso 
administration minister Parente expressed great admiration 
for Palocci and hoped that we would become Minister of 
Finance.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: LULA GETS STARTED - FIGHTING HUNGER ON A TIGHT 
BUDGET 
 
REF: 02 BRASILIA 4561 
 
Classified By: POLOFF RICHARD REITER FOR REASONS 1.5(b) AND (D). 
 
 1.(C) SUMMARY.  President Lula,s administration is 
underway.  At his first cabinet meeting on January 3, Lula 
emphatically focused his ministers both on combating hunger 
and on fiscal austerity.  While the government\'s maneuvering 
room is circumscribed by the lack of a congressional majority 
and its financial limitations, Lula seems determined to chart 
a course that will address hunger, maintain fiscal 
discipline, and either build a stronger congressional 
coalition or find ways to do without it.  END SUMMARY. 
 
FIGHT AGAINST HUNGER IS JOB NUMBER ONE 
-------------------------------------- 
2. (C) President Lula da Silva has never made a secret of his 
desire to attack hunger.  He promised it during the campaign 
and in his election-night speech.  His first post-electoral 
act in November was to set up the &Zero Fome8 (Zero Hunger) 
program headed by Jose Graziano, who now holds the title 
&Extraordinary (Ad hoc) Minister for Food Security and 
Combating Hunger.8  Graziano told us he intends to implement 
his nascent program in phases, beginning in the poorest areas 
of the northeast.  He will not work alone.  At the January 3 
cabinet meeting, Lula directed each of his thirty-four 
cabinet-level officials to draft an anti-hunger strategy 
within thirty days. 
 
3. (SBU) Even those ministries not normally associated with a 
social agenda are jumping aboard:  Defense Minister Viega has 
pledged an anti-illiteracy program, Justice Minister Bastos 
will combat child prostitution, and Finance Minister Palocci 
will look to expand credit cooperatives.  In fact, Lula 
announced that on January 10-11, he will take the entire 
cabinet to the poor backlands of the northeast to launch the 
Zero Fome program.  With Congress out of session until 
mid-February, Lula carried out his first act by Presidential 
Decree (MP).  MP 103, the first of this administration, 
formalizes a number of bodies in the President\'s Office, 
including a Food Security Council (CONSEA) to develop 
anti-hunger policies. 
 
A CAP ON SPENDING - DESPITE PLEAS FROM THE STATES 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
4. (SBU) Combating hunger takes money, but the GoB does not 
appear inclined to deviate from its austerity program.  The 
Ministries, anti-hunger projects will have to come from 
reprogramming existing funds, not new resources.  Since 
November, Lula has been inundated by pleas for financial help 
from cash-strapped states, many of them politically-critical 
to his coalition, yet he has stayed the course.  The richest 
states tend to be the squeakiest wheels: Rio Grande do Sul 
will be forced to slash its budget by 18%, while Minas Gerais 
faces a deficit of R$700 million. 
 
5. (SBU)  But the biggest headache may be the state of Rio de 
Janeiro (septel), which is now behind both on its debts to 
the federal government and the salaries of its state 
employees.  After Rio missed several scheduled debt payments 
to the federal treasury in recent weeks, the GoB first froze 
financial transfers from Brasilia to the state and then 
withdrew R$ 86 million from the state\'s bank accounts (per a 
clause in the loan contract).  This prompted 
newly-inaugurated Rio Governor Rosinha Garotinho to go to the 
Supreme Court to try to unblock the financial transfers while 
calling the GoB,s actions &a declaration of war on Rio8. 
The episode is significant because Garotinho,s Brazilian 
Socialist Party (PSB) is a member of the PT\'s congressional 
coalition.  Rio gave Lula 79% of votes in October\'s 
presidential runoff, his greatest support from any state --in 
part due to Garotinho\'s support.  Rosinha has attributed this 
episode to a long-running PSB/PT feud in the state, as 
Rosinha,s husband, Anthony Garotinho, ran against Lula for 
the presidency at the same time as Rosinha defeated the PT,s 
Benedita da Silva for the Rio statehouse.  The PSB/PT dispute 
will likely be patched up, but it provides a telling example 
of how financial scarcity and local political antagonisms can 
weaken the PT,s coalition.  It is also a measure of Lula,s 
resolve to limit spending, even to key allies. 
 
FIGHTER PLANES IN A HOLDING PATTERN 
----------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Another example of the GoB,s early commitment to 
austerity is the decision to delay purchase of twelve fighter 
planes for the Brazilian Air Force to replace its aging 
Mirage jets.  Instead of choosing a vendor for the roughly 
$800 million contract, new Defense Minister Viegas has 
announced that the purchase will be postponed for a year, 
cutting it close for the Mirages, scheduled to go out of 
service in 2005.  As the planes were to be purchased through 
financing, the postponement will not free up funds, but it 
will avoid locking the administration into a huge commitment 
in its first weeks in office.  Viegas may now consider 
purchasing used aircraft, which could improve the chances for 
the package of used F-16s that is among the bidders. 
 
IN CONGRESS, &THE CLASSES COME LATER8 
------------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) The new Congress will not get down to work until 
February 17, giving the administration six weeks to try to 
secure a majority in both houses by bringing the PMDB party 
into the coalition.  While talks with the PMDB fell apart 
before Christmas (reftel), both sides seem willing to keep 
trying and say they are committed to abiding by a side deal 
by which the PT will support the candidacy of a PMDB member 
for Senate President if the PMDB supports the PT candidate 
for Chamber President.  The PMDB is a difficult party to 
negotiate with because of its internal rifts, so any deal 
will likely have to wait until its leadership elections on 
January 30. 
 
8. (SBU) Lula is working on a &Plan B8 if the PMDB talks 
fall through.  Like Presidents Sarney and Collor before him, 
Lula may try to mitigate his lack of a congressional majority 
by relying on public pressure and his own popularity to 
short-circuit congressional opposition.  The PT has always 
used &assemblyist8 fora to bring different sectors and 
players to a common table.  From this impulse sprang the 
Economic and Social Development Council (CDES) --also 
legalized by MP 103 (above).  CDES brings together 82 
business, labor, and civic leaders in a sort of Brazilian 
&social pact8.  The GoB hopes to use it as a mechanism for 
the public to ratify its policies and thus force Congress to 
support its agenda.  Tarso Genro, former PT Mayor of Porto 
Alegre, will be Lula,s Special Secretary for CDES; and Luiz 
Dulci, the Secretary-General of the President\'s Office, will 
work closely with him and with civil society.  CDES will 
reportedly focus first on pension reform. 
 
9. (SBU) But mindful that neither President Sarney nor Collor 
maintained his congressional support after the flush of 
electoral victory dissipated, Lula surely would prefer a real 
congressional majority to an evanescent social pact. 
Congress can be a tough place for a president without a 
majority.  Or, as one wit noted while Lula received his 
Presidential certificate at the Congressional inauguration 
ceremony, &Lula needs to remember that the presidential 
diploma comes first, but the classes come later.8 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
10. (C) Lula must be doing something right.  This week the 
Brazilian real strengthened to below R$3.40 to the dollar for 
the first time since mid-September --before the first round 
of elections.  The GoB,s reassuring economic team and steady 
drumbeat of austerity rhetoric appear to have calmed the 
markets.  While the political and financial dragons still lie 
before him, Lula appears to have the sound instinct and 
steady nerves it will take to tame them.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S PENSION (\"PREVIDENCIA\") PROBLEM: A BASIC 
PRIMER 
 
Ref: (A) 2002 Brasilia 3790  (B) 2002 Bogota 11782 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
1.  Lula\'s GoB is set to tackle the abysmal fiscal problem of 
Brazil\'s pension system (current budget drain: five-plus 
percent of GDP.)  Of that system\'s total deficit in 2002, its 
three million public-sector pensioners accounted for Rs 53 
billion; its 20.8 million private sector retirees for just Rs 
18 billion.  The incoming GoB\'s plan, outlined by long-time 
Lula confidant Luiz Gushiken, hinges on: (i) unifying the 
private- and public-sector pension systems for all future 
entrants to Brazil\'s workforce; and (ii) limiting all pensions 
to a common eventual ceiling.  This means deep future slashes 
in public-sector pensions.  With these goals, Lula\'s 
administration is turning its back on PT history.  Throughout 
Cardoso\'s presidency, the PT opposed attempts to reform the 
pension system, especially the notion of public-sector pensions 
being anything less than \"integral\" (100% of final salary). 
 
2.  Pushing these policies now will mean a huge fight with 
Brazil\'s entrenched public sector.  And these days the PT\'s 
membership is said to be as -- or more -- numerous amongst mid- 
to-lower level government functionaries as amongst factory 
workers.  Thus, pension reform represents a big early choice 
for Lula between past trade-union loyalties and current fiscal 
exigency.  Even if successful, it would not start to accrue big 
GoB budget savings for years.  Yet in terms of keeping Brazil\'s 
sovereign debt sustainable, GoB pension reform in 2003 can 
reasonably be seen by the longer-sighted component of \'the 
market\' as no less crucial than ongoing GoB primary surpluses. 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
Nature of Problem: Maharajahs and A Fiscal Crater 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
3.  Even in advance of Lula\'s December 20 designation of PT Sao 
Paulo Deputy Ricardo Berzoini (PT-SP) to head \"Previdencia\" 
(Social Security Administration equivalent), the incoming GoB 
was leaving little doubt that it has resolved to tackle 
Brazil\'s infamous pension-system fiscal problem.  Tax reform 
was Lula\'s earliest declared legislative priority for the new 
Congress, but all his most senior PT aides (Palocci, Dirceu, 
Genoino, Mercadante, Genro) now publicly chorus that 
Previdencia\'s overhaul is the vital pre-condition for salvaging 
the GoB\'s fiscal situation in the medium-to-long run.  During 
and since Lula\'s inauguration, the GoB drumbeat on the theme 
has intensified.  \"Without fixing Previdencia, no other budget 
issue will be solved,\" Finance Minister Palocci has summed up, 
and he highlighted the issue both to USTR Zoellick on January 1 
and in his speech at the January 2 ceremony when taking over 
the Finance Ministry sash. 
 
4.  As well he might.  The consolidated Brazilian government\'s 
current annual mismatch between Previdencia receipts and 
outlays is a robust 70-plus billion Reals ($20-plus billion.) 
That exceeds five percent of GDP.  It is one-sixth of gross tax 
revenues.  For comparison: in 2001, Brazil\'s federal government 
spent a total of Rs 44 billion on all its health, education and 
security programs, and total federal investment was under Rs 8 
(eight) billion (admittedly not including state companies like 
Petrobras).  Separate out pensions, and Brazil would be running 
not just a primary but also a nominal budget surplus, even 
while paying more than 8 percent of GDP in interest yearly. 
5.  This fiscal crater was dug by Brazil\'s public-sector 
pensioners.  The latter number some three million, from 
Brazil\'s federal government plus those of its 26 states and 
5,500 municipalities.  They all get an \"integral\" pension, 
i.e., equal to their top lifetime salary (more, in some cases), 
paid out of the budget of the corresponding government level. 
Nor is there any ceiling to these public-sector pensions. 
Public employees began paying into their own pension fund only 
after 1992; they now have just 11% of salary deducted. 
 
6.  Brazil\'s 20.8 million private-sector retirees under the 
national social-security scheme (INSS) also pay up to 11% of 
their salaries on a sliding scale on the first Rs 1,561 of 
their monthly salaries.  But their employers must pay INSS an 
extra 20% of payroll as extra contribution towards the whole 
Previdencia system.  (That in turn helps depress the ratio of 
Brazil\'s working population with \"carteira assinada,\" i.e., 
working on the books as part of the formal, tax-paying economy, 
to an estimated 45-50% -- a further problem.)  Private-sector 
workers wind up with a mere fraction of their salaries as 
pension, computed via a complex formula based on years worked, 
remaining life expectancy, lifetime average salary, et al.  And 
they max out at just Rs 1,561 (ten so-called \'reference minimum 
salaries\') per month. 
 
7.  Bottom line:  Previdencia\'s total yearly deficit for the 
consolidated Brazilian government in 2002 was Rs 70-plus 
billion ($20-plus billion), i.e., 5.2% of GDP, roughly two- 
thirds in the Federal budget, and the rest in states\' and 
municipalities\'.  Of this total, Rs 53 billion was spent on 
public-sector retirees, and just Rs 18 billion on private- 
sector ones.  According to the GoB\'s own computations, each 
public-sector retiree costs the budget Rs 14,590 per year, vs. 
Rs 656 (sic) per private-sector retiree. 
 
8.  The disparity further narrows down to 600,000-900,000 of 
Brazil\'s best-paid civil servants, its so-called \"maharajahs.\" 
Even under the current system, according to one analysis, 80% 
of public-sector retirees are due pensions beneath the private- 
sector cap of Rs 1,560.  It is thus the remaining 20% -- i.e., 
one in perhaps thirty Brazilian pensioners -- who make off with 
most of the gravy.  Most egregiously, these \"maharajahs\" are 
concentrated in the legislature and Justice Ministry, where the 
medium salary is reputedly Rs 5,500.  Their reported average 
monthly pension is Rs 8,000. 
 
Past Reform Efforts:  FHC\'s Failure 
----------------------------------- 
9.  Former president Cardoso launched a constitutional 
amendment for Previdencia reform at the outset of his first 
term in 1995.  Eight years later, supporters claim FHC was 
largely successful in containing costs on the private-pension 
(INSS) side, but concede that results on the public-sector side 
were marginal.  FHC did raise the standard required length of 
service to 30 and 25 years, respectively, for men and women. 
He also introduced the principle of longevity not just of work 
but of payments into the Previdencia system as the basis for 
pension eligibility. 
 
10.  The closest FHC came to a breakthrough was in 1998, when a 
majority in Congress approved a bill that inter alia raised 
public servants\' contribution to Previdencia from 11 to 25% of 
salary on a sliding scale, and introduced (at IMF insistence) 
the principle that retirees also pay towards the system.  A 
preliminary Supreme Court injunction, however, then declared 
such measures to be \"confiscatory\" and thus to require approval 
by a three-fifths legislative vote under the constitution.  The 
Court\'s final decision on the subject is still pending. 
 
11.  Thereafter, FHC\'s pension-reform efforts subsided.  True, 
his GoB finally procured its constitutional amendment in 1998. 
But that amendment only passed after being stripped of its 
reform teeth on the public-pension side.  As with the general 
fiscal-reform inertia of FHC\'s second term, a prime cause was 
that he had traded too many legislative chips to obtain the 
constitutional amendment which let him be re-elected.  Yet the 
outgoing GoB can also rightly charge that the PT then opposed 
and blocked pension reform at every turn. 
 
PT\'s About-Face, Pension-Reform Premises 
---------------------------------------- 
12. So the new GoB\'s plans for basic reform were far from 
predictable.  Their design, as presented in post-election media 
accounts, is attributed to Lula\'s deputy transition 
coordinator, long-term core confidante, campaign coordinator in 
the 1994 and 1998 presidential races, and now Secretary for 
Communications, Luiz Gushiken.  Apart from his personal bond 
with Lula, Gushiken comes substantively well-armed.  His 
private consulting company specializes in social-security and 
pension matters.  Health problems reportedly precluded him from 
being put in charge of Previdencia, but his second-in-command 
at the company, Augusto Tadeu Ferrarri, is presumed likely to 
be involved in advancing the reform campaign. 
 
13.  NOTE:  Lula\'s first-round rival and second-round supporter 
in the presidential race Ciro Gomes was said to want the 
Previdencia job keenly.  However, Ciro\'s own proposals for 
pension reform, as enunciated during the campaign, were for a 
system of individual retirement accounts, the transition to 
which by common professional agreement would have been 
financially insupportable -- \"two to three (Brazilian) GDPs,\" 
according to Gushiken\'s firm.  Lula made Ciro Minister of 
National Integration instead.  Previdencia went to Berzoini, a 
42-year-old PT congressman and former bank-employee labor 
leader with little apparent executive experience.  END NOTE. 
 
14.  The reform plan\'s twin premises are: (i) unification of 
the private INSS and public-sector pension systems for all 
future entrants to Brazil\'s workforce; and (ii) a common future 
ceiling for all pensions.  That ceiling is putatively to be 
fixed via negotiations with all affected parties by the GoB. 
The official suggestion for now is that it should be somewhere 
between Rs 1,561 (the ten \'minimum reference salaries\') and 
twenty times the minimum salary (currently Rs 200, but due to 
be raised at least to Rs 220.)  As first publicized, the PT 
plan seemed to accept that Brazil\'s already-retired 
(\"inativos\") cannot be made to contribute to the pension 
system.  However, new Previdencia chief Berzoini has begun to 
hint otherwise. 
 
15.  What about Brazil\'s not-yet retired?  Previous debate on 
pension reform has featured the rote GoB promise to respect 
\"acquired rights\" -- code meaning that the rules of the game 
will not be changed in mid-career for current public 
functionaries.  In a new twist, though, PT party leader Genoino 
and others now intone that \"acquired rights\" (i.e., pensions 
already being paid to retirees) are not the same as \"acquired 
expectations\" (i.e., current workers\' assumption that their 
eventual pensions will be computed per the old basis.)  There 
is now the suggestion that current public-sector employees will 
see their eventual pensions diminished on a sliding scale from 
10 to 40% of the \"integral\".  Only if some such change is 
installed, of course, can the GoB realize major fiscal savings 
anytime before the end of the working lifespan of functionaries 
not yet even in the system -- i.e., three decades hence. 
 
16.  Lula thus seems positioned to place himself in favor of a 
more radical Previdencia transformation than FHC ever 
attempted.  In so doing, he and the new GoB will be turning 
their backs on the PT\'s own history.  The latter is replete 
with resistance to public-sector pension reform and to the 
notion of those pensions being less than \"integral\".  Pushing 
for such changes now will mean a tough battle with Brazil\'s 
entrenched, well-organized public-sector unions.  The latter 
now loom large in Brazil\'s labor movement generally, with the 
PT said to have as much or more of a numerical base in mid-to- 
lower level government workers than amongst factory workers. 
Thus, the issue involves an early choice for Lula between past 
party loyalties and current fiscal exigency. 
 
Prospects:  Better than Before 
------------------------------ 
17.  For now, the GoB leaders\' byword is \'consultation.\'  All 
are on-script in saying that social consensus for pension 
reform should and will be arrived at via mass public dialogue. 
The head of Lula\'s new \"town-hall\" Economic and Social 
Development Council (Rio Grande do Sul\'s PT ex-governor Tarso 
Genro) has said that producing a consensus on Previdencia will 
be his Council\'s top task in the coming year.  As to why 
beneficiaries of the status quo should agree to forfeit any 
\'rights\', the new GoB argues that consensus will arise when all 
realize that to keep the system alive as is will bankrupt it, 
bringing worse losses for all. 
 
18.  Conversely, the question arises:  why would public-pension 
reform not/not be a sure-fire political winner for any GoB, 
given that it could be painted as a simple matter of Brazil\'s 
\'maharajahs\' vs. its general population?  The answer seems to 
be that even for lower-paid functionaries -- federal, state and 
municipal -- \"integral\" pensions are a major, built-in life 
expectation. 
 
19.  There is no guarantee that Brazil\'s more center/right 
political parties which voted for pension reform before in 
Congress will necessarily do so again in support of a PT 
version.  And key questions such as whether \"inativos\" may be 
made to pay into Previdencia remain to be judged by the Supreme 
Court.  Most thus expect the fight on the Previdencia reform 
front to be steeply uphill.  Yet we also already hear some 
optimistic predictions, including from new Central Bank 
Chairman Meirelles to Ambassador in their January 8 meeting 
(Septel), that pension reform this year has good chances, given 
Lula\'s landslide, his reserves of popular enthusiasm, and the 
fact that the well-disciplined PT will now support it. 
 
Lula Sets Timetable 
------------------- 
20.  On January 7, Lula formally directed Berzoini together 
with Economic and Social Development Counsel (ESDC) chief Genro 
to initiate the Previdencia reform campaign by February.  Over 
the following ninety days, Berzoini is to engage in broad, 
country-wide discussions with politicians, businessmen, labor, 
public servants, and NGOs.  He is to report the results to the 
ESDC, which will harmonize public suggestions with the main 
lines of the GoB\'s own draft design.  Proposals based on the 
results of this process are to be presented to Lula in May, so 
as to be worked into a bill for presentation to Congress before 
summer adjournment.

INTEGRATION WITHIN ITAMARATY 
 
1. SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. 
 
2.  Summary.  Moving quickly to bring his ministry\'s 
institutions in line with the new government\'s focus on South 
American integration, and in particular, a reinvigoration of 
Mercosul, Foreign Minister Amorim has announced the creation 
of a new South America Under Secretariat.  One GOB official 
described creation of the new under secretariat, as 
indicative of a \"watershed\" in GOB policy concerning 
Mercosul.  Despite the reorganization, there is a sense of 
continuity regarding FTAA and WTO trade policy amongst our 
key trade contacts within Itamaraty.  While some policy 
changes are inevitable, they are expected to be more of 
emphasis than of wholesale change of direction.  This is 
largely due to the retention of Ambassador Clodoaldo Hugueney 
as the main Itamaraty architect of FTAA and WTO trade policy. 
 End Summary. 
 
New Under Secretariat for South America 
 
3. The following details are chiefly based on Trade Officer\'s 
recent conversations with Ambassadors Simas Magalhaes and 
Valdemar Leao.  Working within a rigid structure that limits 
the number of under secretariats in Itamaraty to four, 
Foreign Minister Amorim has proposed creation of a new Under 
Secretariat for South America to be headed by Brazil\'s 
 
SIPDIS 
Ambassador to Mexico, Luiz Felipe Macedo Soares.  In a 
departure from past practice, the new Under Secretariat will 
focus all political and economic activity associated with 
South American, and particularly Mercosul, integration under 
the direction of one person.  To this end, the Directorate 
for Latin American Integration, previously under Ambassador 
Hugueney\'s Under Secretariat for Integration and Economic and 
Trade Affairs, will be shifted to the new under secretariat, 
as will all relevant offices from the Under Secretariat for 
Bilateral Political Affairs. In addition to internal Mercosul 
economic matters, it is expected that the new under 
secretariat will be responsible for \"bilateral\" Mercosul 
 
SIPDIS 
trade negotiations with countries or country groups within 
Latin America, e.g. with the Andean Community, Central 
America, etc.  Ambassador Valdemar Leao of Itamaraty\'s 
Economic Department told us on January 23 that the placement 
of Mercosul-Mexican relations has not been finalized. 
However, FTAA negotiations will definitely remain with U/S 
Hugueney. 
 
4. Itamaraty must receive approval from the GOB Ministry of 
Planning before the reorganization becomes official.  This 
approval involves a cumbersome bureaucratic exercise as 
Itamaraty currently is by law not allowed to exceed four 
under secretariats and must develop a plan consistent with 
other limits on the number and level of certain positions. 
As a result, all political affairs, multilateral as well as 
bilateral with countries outside the region, are expected to 
be merged into one Under Secretariat for Political Affairs. 
Leao as good as said that he and other Itamaraty veterans saw 
this portfolio as being an all but impossible burden for one 
individual.  The implication was that it would cause de facto 
shifts in responsibilities within Itamaraty unless the 
Ministry gains future permission to expand to a fifth under 
secretariat. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
FTAA and Mercosul-EU Remain Key 
 
5. U/S Hugueney reportedly supported the reorganization, 
which will allow his trimmed down Under Secretariat of 
Economic and Trade Affairs to focus on what are Brazil\'s most 
important trade negotiations -- the FTAA and Mercosul-EU 
negotiations.  To expand the depth of Itamaraty\'s expertise 
for these negotiations, Hugueney has created an additional 
bureaucratic layer by forming a new Department of 
International Negotiations.  The new department, to be headed 
by Ambassador Carlos Alberto Simas Magalhaes, will have only 
two divisions: one will be the existing FTAA Coordinating 
Office (COALCA), the other a new division for Mercosul 
extra-hemisphere trade negotiations, most importantly with 
the EU.  WTO negotiations also remain with Hugueney, whose 
Economic Department houses the technical trade offices that 
conduct both the WTO and FTAA negotiations. 
6. According to Ambassador Leao, the Economic Department may 
also experience some lesser changes.  For instance, under 
consideration is the placement of the office responsible for 
trade disputes, which currently reports directly to Hugueney, 
under the Economic Department.  In addition, Leao\'s Division 
of Intellectual Property and New Themes might move to the 
Department for Scientific and Technical Cooperation, an 
existing department within Hugueney\'s Under Secretariat, 
which might also, at least temporarily, absorb the current 
Department for Commercial Promotion. 
 
The New Trade Team 
 
7. Ambassador Simas, who spent time in Geneva with Foreign 
Minister Amorim, told us on January 22 that he plans to focus 
more on the substance of FTAA negotiations than on Co-Chair 
issues.  He will also now assume the position as head of 
Brazil\'s FTAA delegation, opposite AUSTR Regina Vargo, as 
Hugueney assumes a Co-Chair position alongside DUSTR 
Allgeier.  Although Ambassador Simas did not have direct 
responsibility for FTAA issues in his former position as the 
President\'s Special Mercosul Representative, he followed FTAA 
issues since Mercosul has been negotiating as a block. 
Working for him on Co-Chair issues as the new head of the 
COALCA office is Tovar da Silva Nunes, chief of staff for the 
former Minister of MDIC, Ambassador Sergio Amaral.  The 
COALCA position was made vacant with the promotion of Antonio 
Simoes to Minister Amorim\'s cabinet as Economic Advisor 
immediately following the Foreign Minister\'s inauguration. 
Da Silva Nunes is well connected politically, having served 
in positions supporting his successful mentor Ambassador 
Amaral for the past decade, and with the private sector from 
his stint at MDIC.  Simas is reportedly going to draw from 
staff in Geneva to fill the position as head of the Mercosul 
trade negotiation division. 
 
8. As an additional note, Maria Nazareth Farani Azevedo, who 
was tapped to work as an advisor to Foreign Minister Amorim 
on Political and Multilateral Affairs, will be replaced as 
head of the Market Access Division in the Economic Department 
by Luis Antonio Balduino, who is transferring from an 
assignment in the World Bank. 
 
9. Comment:   The new government is moving quickly to 
establish the institutional structures that will better 
enable it to act on its clearly stated political and economic 
priority of regional integration.  Despite some lingering 
skepticism among the public and within official circles 
regarding initiatives to \"once again\" reinvigorate Mercosul, 
the seriousness with which this administration is moving in 
accord with this aim is striking.  Ambassador Leao expressed 
surprise at the level of commitment within the new government 
and described the ministry\'s reorganization as indicative of 
a \"watershed\" in GOB policy concerning Mercosul. 
 
10. Despite a clear emphasis being placed on Mercosul and 
wider regional integration, the importance of FTAA 
negotiations does not appear to have diminished for the GOB 
as demonstrated by actions to refocus and strengthen 
Hugueney\'s Under Secretariat for Economic and Trade Affairs. 
Post would expect the retention of FTAA and WTO negotiating 
responsibilities under the direction of Hugueney to portend 
not only continuity of GOB positions but also of the overall 
commitment of the GOB to these negotiations. 
 
11. Ambassador Hugueney, who cut his trade teeth during the 
Tokyo Round, enjoys exceptional credibility within the new 
government and is well respected within international trade 
circles.  He has been a reasonable and responsive 
interlocutor with the Mission and other USG officials.  With 
a trimmed down Under Secretariat, Hugueney should be able to 
focus more attention on the FTAA and WTO negotiations. 
According to Itamaraty staff, Hugueney has successfully lined 
up experienced trade officials/negotiators that he can 
increasingly rely on as the FTAA and WTO negotiations enter 
more intensive phases.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  On January 23, new Minister of 
Communications Miro Teixeira proposed that the GoB form an 
inter-ministerial group to study and present findings on 
the viability of a made-in-Brazil digital television (DTV) 
standard.  The announcement immediately followed Teixeira\'s 
review of a CPqD (Centro de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento em 
Telecomunicacoes) report espousing the benefits of an 
n 
indigenous standard (Note. CPqD is an independent research 
institute based in Campinas, Sao Paulo.  End Note.) 
Although Teixeira had previously made statements that 
Brazil should go it alone on DTV, most informed sources 
assumed the new minister was still in his reading-in 
period.  Teixeira\'s declared intention is to produce a 
definitive GoB decision on DTV in the next six months, with 
implementation to start in 2005.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) BACKGROUND.  The GoB has been debating the DTV 
decision for the past several years.  In 2000, Globo 
sponsored a series of tests that supposedly established the 
Japanese standard as the \"technically superior\" model based 
on its alleged mobile capabilities (reftel D).  Since that 
time, the debate within ANATEL and Ministry of 
Communications (MOC) circles turned from technical points 
to discussion about the need to define the \"business model\" 
and solicit \"offsets.\"  In April 2002, then-Minister of 
Communications Juarez Quadros told Ambassador the MOC 
viewed the technical capabilities of all three standards as 
approaching parity, and therefore a non-issue (reftel C). 
 
3. (SBU) In September 2002, the outgoing GoB sang its swan 
song on the subject by publishing an official strategy 
defining technical requirements, outlining desirable 
\"deliverables\" to be negotiated, and expanding 
participation in the process to several ministries (reftel 
B).  As we commented at the time, in so doing the GoB 
brought the DTV process in effect back to square one.  END 
BACKGROUND. 
 
ENTER THE NEW BOSS, NOT ENTIRELY LIKE THE OLD BOSS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
4. (U) Shortly after being sworn-in as Minister of 
Communications, Miro Teixeira (bio in reftel A) suggested 
that Brazil develop its own DTV standard, perhaps in 
partnership with China and/or India.  Although many 
informed insiders believed the Minister was simply not up 
to speed on the issue, CPqD subsequently gave force to his 
assertions by presenting a report on the feasibility of the 
indigenous standard concept.  According to the CPqD report, 
a Brazilian DTV standard could be created within a year and 
be ready for debut in mid-2005.  The quoted R$100 million 
cost would be financed by FUNTTEL (Fund for 
Telecommunications Technological Development.)  Proponents 
of the report claim Brazil could reduce unit cost by 
avoiding royalties, while creating a potential export 
platform for other countries that might adopt the Brazilian 
standard.  (Comment:  CPqD is a former government research 
institute that underwent phased-privatization over a number 
of years, and now must seek its own financing sources.  The 
credibility of the organization is unclear.) 
 
 
 
THOSE WHO CANNOT REMEMBER THE PAST. 
----------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) Teixeira, in making his earlier comments and now 
in announcing the inter-ministerial study, risks repeating 
a historical mistake.  In the 1960s, when world governments 
were choosing color television standard, Brazil\'s military 
dictators decided to go it alone by creating the PAL-M 
standard.  Contrary to the GoB hope, PAL-M did not widely 
expand beyond Brazil and resulted in higher unit costs. 
(Note: Econoffs have heard ANATEL officers joke about the 
failure of the PAL-M system many times over the course of 
the last year.)  Convincing GoB officials that choosing an 
indigenous DTV standard would be to tread down the same 
false path twice will be one of Post\'s strategies in any 
upcoming debate on the subject. 
 
COMMENT:  MISSION RESPONSE 
-------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) The Minister\'s announcement indicated that the 
inter-ministerial group, to include the Ministry of 
Communications, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the 
Ministry of Trade and Development, and the Ministry of 
Foreign Relations, would conclude a study and present 
findings leading to a decision within the next six months. 
This affords ample mission time to engage the GoB on the 
merits of CPqD\'s paper, and to continue arguing that the 
ATSC standard presents the best path to achieving Brazilian 
social and economic goals.  We will not be alone in 
pointing out the defects of a native Brazilian standard. 
There have already been editorials in Folha and the Sao 
Paulo Jornal da Tarde (left-leaning regional newspaper) 
calling Teixeira\'s concept \"extreme\" in the case of the 
former, and asserting the decision \"would trade probable 
profits for certain losses\" in the case of the latter. 
Informal meetings between Consulate Rio and high-level 
ANATEL advisors indicate similar sentiment, and ABERT 
(Associacao Brasilia de Emissoras de Radio e Televisao, 
whose largest member is Globo) has also already voiced 
concerns. 
 
7.  (SBU) The MOC\'s door is open.  Advisors in the MOC say 
that Teixeira is interested in obtaining more information 
on ATSC, and is looking forward to a courtesy call with the 
Ambassador.  Post strategy will be to stick to arguments 
concerning the potential economic gains available with ATSC 
while avoiding any sidetracking to technical aspects of the 
four potential standards, which has proven to be an 
unproductive red herring in the past.  We will focus on 
convincing the GoB that North America is already the most 
well-developed market, and that neither the U.S. nor Canada 
produce televisions or place onerous barriers on their 
importation.  On a practical level, we will maintain our 
relationship with the ATSC forum, placing them in contact 
with appropriate GoB decision-makers, and working toward 
facilitating information flow through frequent contact and 
visitor exchanges.  Post suggests that continuation of last 
year\'s superb bilateral exchanges is also vital to 
maximizing communications and credibility.

REF: (A) 2002 STATE 254964 (B) MONTEVIDEO 0076 
 
 1. This cable responds to questions raised in reftel A 
regarding regulation of services at the federal and 
sub-federal level. 
 
2. Brazil is a Federal Republic.  Brazil\'s government is 
comprised of the Federal Government, 26 state governments, 
one Federal District government and approximately 5,500 
municipalities.  The Brazilian Constitution lays out the 
respective legislative responsibilities of each of these 
governmental layers. 
 
3. Contrary to what was suggested in reftel B, regulatory 
authority over services in Brazil resides fundamentally with 
the Federal Government.  For certain services, including 
conditions for the practice of professions, operation of 
communication services, energy services, transportation 
services, commercial services (distribution, wholesale, 
etc.), and financial services, the Constitution specifically 
assigns sole legislative/regulatory authority to the Federal 
Government. 
 
4. For other areas (environmental services; educational and 
training services; recreational, cultural and sporting 
services; and health related services), both the Federal 
Government and states are allowed to concurrently pass 
legislation.  However, the Constitution stipulates that in 
these areas, federal law overrides state law if the two are 
inconsistent.  In areas of concurrent legislation, federal 
legislation is limited to the establishment of general rules, 
with state legislation providing more specificity. According 
to the Constitution, for areas in which no federal law 
exists, states may exercise full legislative competence. 
Municipalities are able to supplement federal and state 
legislation where pertinent, including in the areas of mass 
transportation, health services and protection of cultural 
heritage. 
 
5.  It should be noted that with ratification of an 
international agreement, its provisions become part of 
federal law.  For service areas in which no federal 
legislation previously existed, the provisions of the 
international agreement would establish the federal 
regulation, and therefore limiting parameters, of any 
sub-federal regulations. 
 
6. Officials within Itamaraty that are responsible for GOB 
services negotiations assert that sub-federal regulations are 
never inconsistent with federal regulation because all state 
and municipal regulations must by law comply with federal 
regulation.  The argument goes that since the inconsistent 
state and municipal laws would automatically be struck down 
by the courts, no attempts are made to usurp federal purview. 
 The clear delegation of regulatory authority as stipulated 
in the Constitution supports, but doesn\'t prove this 
contention.  The only enforcement mechanisms that appear to 
be available are the threat of lawsuits or fines. 
 
7.  Post was able to identify one example of a state clearly 
defying federal regulators.  During the Cardoso 
administration, then governor of Minas Gerais, Itamar Franco, 
refused to \"deverticalize\" the Minas Gerais Energy Company 
(Cemig) in defiance of a regulation promulgated by the 
federal energy regulator (Aneel); the regulation was related 
to privatization of the company, which still counted the 
state of Minas Gerais as the majority stake-holder.  The 
company was fined, but the state never capitulated.  The new 
Minister of Mines and Energy has recently expressed her 
opinion that Cemig is not obligated under law to 
deverticalize.

     FAIR-SMITH/MALITO EMAIL 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. 
 
1. (U) Brazilian dailies Gazeta Mercantil and O Estado 
reported today on the progress of market access discussions 
this week between Mercosul FTAA negotiating teams meeting in 
Asuncion.  The dailies note that a consensus position 
regarding all of the FTAA market access offers has not been 
achieved.  O Estado reported that Brazil had been unable to 
convince its Mercosul partners to delay submission of offers 
for services, investment and government procurement beyond 
the February 15 deadline, and speculated that this would 
pressure Brazil to accelerate preparation of its offers. 
 
2.  (SBU) ECONOFF subsequently spoke to Ana Patricia Neves 
Tanaka, an official who follows the FTAA market access 
negotiations within Itamaraty\'s FTAA Coordinating Office 
(COALCA), to clarify the situation; Tovar da Silva Nunes, 
head of COALCA, is still in Asuncion.  Although no final 
decision will be made until Mercosul Ministers meet in 
Montevideo on February 5, it is expected that, as previously 
reported, joint Mercosul offers for industrial and 
agricultural goods will be made by February 15. 
 
3.  (SBU) Contrary to what was reported in O Estado, Neves 
Tanaka confirmed that Brazil still plans at this time to make 
a separate services offer also by February 15 (ref A); she 
expects that the other Mercosul countries will do likewise. 
Driven by differing legislation and national interests, the 
Mercosul partners have reportedly agreed to proceed with 
individual offers in services, investment and government 
procurement.  According to Neves Tanaka, the main 
disagreement surrounds Brazil\'s interest in delaying its 
market access offers for investment and government 
procurement. 
 
4. (SBU) Brazil is reportedly facing opposition to its 
proposal to delay investment and government procurement 
offers because Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have theirs 
prepared and want to meet the February 15 deadline.  The 
expectation in Itamaraty has been that Mercosul proposals in 
the areas of services, investments, and government 
procurement would be presented under common preambles, with 
separate market access offers attached. 
 
5. (SBU) Neves Tanaka believes it is unlikely that Brazil 
will change its decision to delay investment and government 
procurement offers until after February 15.  This would leave 
its Mercosul partners in the uncomfortable position of having 
to decide if they will all hold back, or present an even less 
than united front by moving forward without Brazil. 
 
6.  (SBU) Neves Tanaka explained that the first three days of 
the meeting this week were political in nature and that 
discussions yesterday and today are technical.  Technical 
work is focused on developing the joint goods offers.  One 
thorny technical issue being discussed is how to treat 
products for which the Mercosul members have different 
tariffs rates due to the many exceptions that have been taken 
to the group\'s Common External Tariff.  No additional 
information regarding characteristics of the Mercosul goods 
offers is available at this time (ref B).

SUBJECT: BRAZIL SWAYS MERCOSUL ON FTAA OFFERS 
 
REF: BRASILIA 00356 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
1. (U) Following through on its rhetoric to strengthen and 
unify Mercosul, Brazil\'s new government has acted forcefully 
and decisively to forge consensus with its Mercosul partners 
over FTAA initial offers.  Foreign Minister Amorim, first 
securing the Argentine pledge of solidarity in Buenos Aires 
on February 4 was able to bring Uruguay and Paraguay into the 
fold during a February 5 Ministerial meeting in Montevideo. 
A week earlier, there had been dissension in the Mercosul 
ranks at Brazil\'s insistence that investment and government 
procurement offers from the group be delayed beyond the 
February 15 deadline (reftel). 
 
Where the Offers Stand 
---------------------- 
 
-- Goods 
 
2. (SBU) As previously reported (reftel), Mercosul plans to 
submit by February 15 a consolidated offer as a group; the 
list will cover industrial and agricultural products. A 
chapeau for the offer will present some general conditions 
including reference to a single-undertaking, balance between 
commitments in market access with obligations in other areas, 
GATT, etc.  In a February 7 discussion with econoff, Tovar da 
Silva Nunes, head of Itamaraty\'s FTAA Coordinating Office 
(COALCA), provided the following rough breakdown of the 
Mercosul goods offer as a percentage of Mercosul-FTAA trade: 
 
Category A (immediate duty-free): 18 percent 
Category B (tariff elimination in 5 years): 3 percent 
Category C (tariff elimination 5-10 years): 18 percent 
Category D (tariff elimination over 10 years): 60 percent. 
 
Product coverage of the offer is comprehensive (total above 
is less than 100 percent due to rounding error).  NOTE: local 
press reported incorrectly that the above percentages refer 
to number of products.  According to Da Silva Nunes, the 
number of tariff lines relating to categories A, B, and C 
combined is roughly 54 percent.  END NOTE. 
 
3. (U) Da Silva Nunes claimed that Brazil\'s offer had been 
more ambitious before the Mercosul consolidation process. 
Given the disparity in the productive structure of the 
Mercosul partners, he explained that the general rule used to 
produce a joint list was to adopt the most cautious position 
presented by one of the Mercosul partners.  So, if three 
countries had placed a product in the A category, but the 
fourth had it in Category C, it was placed in Category C on 
the combined list.  Apparently this process had to be applied 
to over 7,000 tariff lines, he noted, not always with a 
result that made sense for Brazilian business. 
 
4. (U) Brazil\'s decision-making body for foreign trade 
issues, CAMEX, met yesterday to approve the offer.  According 
to press reports, the Ministries of Fazenda and Agriculture 
had wanted a more ambitious offer, but Itamaraty and the 
Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC) prevailed 
with the Mercosul offer as agreed to in Montevideo. 
 
-- Services 
 
5. (SBU) According to Da Silva Nunes, Mercosul continues to 
plan to present services offers by February 15, but that 
decision is still not final since ministerial consultations 
within the GOB are on-going.  In addition, the GOB is 
evaluating whether recent changes in its civil code will 
require slight revisions to its offer (a new civil code which 
passed at the beginning of the year includes several 
provisions relating to the establishment of businesses).  The 
services submission will be under a Mercosul chapeau, with 
separate, positive lists attached (reftel).  As Da Silva 
Nunes explained, Mercosul countries have to supply separate 
offers because GATS plus for one would not necessarily be 
GATS plus for another. (Note: Brazil had indicated that its 
offer will only apply to commitments at the central or 
federal level.  Da Silva Nunes said that Paraguay has asked 
Brazil to consider whether, as negotiations proceed, it would 
be willing to make commitments at the sub-federal level.) 
 
-- Investment and Government Procurement 
 
6. (SBU) While no time-line for submission of investment and 
government procurement offers has been decided, Da Silva 
Nunes suggested that Mercosul would definitely want to submit 
these offers in advance of the Trade Negotiating Committee 
(TNC) meeting April 9-11.   He claimed Mercosul will want to 
be in a strong position in the TNC meeting to argue for the 
establishment of certain modalities and would not want its 
position undermined by not having submitted offers in all of 
the market access areas. 
 
7. (U) Da Silva Nunes stressed that these are initial offers 
and that once offers are on the table, Mercosul will evaluate 
whether or not it has to quickly improve its offers to be 
compatible with what others have presented. 
 
Public Access to Information on Offers 
 
8. (SBU) Econoff inquired as to GOB plans regarding public 
dissemination of information contained in FTAA offers.  Da 
Silva Nunes said no decision has been made yet.  He said that 
the GOB will probably release all the details of its own 
offers.  He noted that it would be helpful to know what other 
FTAA partners are planning or would prefer in terms of 
treatment of their offers.  He believed the GOB would act 
according to the wishes of each of its FTAA partners.

1. (SBU)  Summary.  On February 6, Embassy hosted a 
Roundtable on Electricity Regulation in Brazil with 
participation by 16 executives from 8 U.S. and European 
companies from both the generation and distribution sides. 
Companies\' main concerns were short-term liquidity issues, 
continued low electricity demand, and the upcoming periodic 
review of tariff rates.  Companies were clearly anxious over 
the new GoB\'s impending reformulation of sector regulation, 
and most attendees noted that their companies have halted 
further investments in Brazil pending the emergence of a 
clear regulatory model.  Nonetheless, all company 
representatives termed their access to GoB officials as 
\"good\" and their initial impressions of Minister of Mines and 
Energy (MME) Dilma Roussef as positive.  Groundwork was laid 
for a continuing dialogue between the private sector and the 
Mission.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  As part of a mission-wide strategy to coordinate 
our policy approach in Brazil\'s energy sector, on February 6 
the Ambassador hosted a diverse group of electric utilities 
including U.S. companies Alliant, Duke, Enron, AES, Mirant, 
and PSEG, as well as European companies EDP (Portuguese), and 
Tractebel (Belgian).  Grupo Cataguazes (Brazilian) and Endesa 
(Spanish) were last minute no-shows.  Ambassador and CG Rio 
had already hosted a similar event for hydrocarbon companies 
in ConGenRio during the last week of January (ref A). 
Ambassador and CGs have also been meeting frequently with 
U.S. companies on a one-on-one basis.  Econ and commercial 
officers followed-up the February 6 roundtable by making a 
courtesy call on MME Secretary for Energy Marcelo Poppe. 
Ambassador expects to make her initial call on Roussef during 
the week of February 24. 
 
Background to a Mess 
-------------------- 
3. (U)  The timing and concerns of the roundtable reflect the 
current confusion and uncertainty surrounding the electricity 
sector.  In the mid-90s, the Cardoso administration embarked 
on an ambitious privatization program to attract much-needed 
investment to the state-dominated energy sector.  The process 
was poorly implemented from the start, as Congress failed to 
pass comprehensive sector reform legislation similar to that 
created for the telecommunications sector via the General Law 
of Telecommunications.  Instead, Congress carried out the 
process piece-meal.  Congress first legalized the sale of 
states\' distribution companies.  In 1995, Espirito Santo sold 
its distribution company ESCELCA to a group of foreign 
investors.  U.S. companies, led by AES, began investing in 
1996. 
 
4. (U)  Reform legislation continued to trickle through 
Congress, resulting in the creation of the national 
electricity regulator ANEEL in 1997, and the creation of the 
wholesale energy market (MAE) in 1998.  Although the National 
Council for Energy Policy (CNPE), a committee within the MME, 
was given responsibility for long-term policy planning, the 
weakness of the MME as an institution encouraged ANEEL to 
step into the policy realm and complete the sector reform 
process de facto through regulation.  CNPE has met only three 
times to discuss long-term policy.  Roussef has commented on 
various occasions that the MME will \"recapture the policy 
role\" from ANEEL. 
 
5. (U) Devaluation at the beginning of 1999 presented the 
first warning signal for foreign companies whose debts were 
dollar-dominated, but whose revenue streams were in Brazilian 
reals.  Since 1999 the dollar has appreciated approximately 
200 percent in nominal terms against the real.  For 
distribution companies, this has been partially compensated 
by annual GoB tariff adjustments based on a broad-based 
inflation index -- 87 percent over the same period.  Currency 
risk has also put a damper on thermal-generation investment, 
as the cost of turbines, fuel, and natural gas are 
dollar-linked. 
 
6. (U)  The privatization process met growing political 
resistance in 2000 when the government\'s plan to privatize 
state generator giant FURNAS faltered amidst popular 
discontent.  The process then stalled-out completely with the 
electricity shortage and subsequent government-mandated 
rationing in 2001.  Although the outgoing government received 
high marks for managing the rationing crisis, it was unable 
to make progress on a comprehensive reformulation of the 
regulatory model, leaving this major headache for the new 
government. 
 
7. (U)  The GoB also failed to provide permanent fixes to 
institutions such as the MAE (see ref C), the CNPE, and 
ANEEL.  Although the GoB ended rationing in February 2002, 
deleterious after-effects continue to affect generators and 
distributors as electricity end-users have rolled back their 
consumption to 1999 levels.  Lower demand, combined with 
abundant rains that have filled reservoirs in Brazil\'s 90 
percent hydro-dominated system, has led to an electricity 
surplus depressing spot prices to their regulated price floor 
- approximately 1.15 dollars per megawatt hour.  This is 
unfortunate timing as a pre-planned phased liberalization of 
the market freed 25 percent of the market\'s bilateral 
electricity contracts held between generators and 
distributors on January 1, 2003.  This electricity, estimated 
to be between 3,500 to 5,000 megawatts of capacity, remains 
unsold.  Generators have begun to assert that the government, 
or distributors, must find a way to share the pain for the 
depressed prices. 
 
8. (U)  In summary, the new government of President Lula has 
inherited an electricity sector mess.  Dollar-linked debt, 
depressed supply prices, institutional gridlock, 
macroeconomic constraints (i.e., inflation-target and 
fiscal-surplus limits), and the supposed left-leaning 
platform on which the new government rode into power all 
raise doubts among investors for the long-run viability of 
the electricity sector. 
 
9. (SBU)  In addition to putting out some of the fires above, 
the new government must now define a sector model, 
principally deciding what role private finance, current and 
future, will play. Roussef, a former 1970s guerilla (ref B), 
spent the first month putting her team together, and from all 
accounts is serious, frank, and intelligent. Despite these 
positive attributes, industry anxiety regarding her plans for 
the sector and the outcome of the new model is running high. 
 
Distributors Focus on Tariff Reviews 
------------------------------------ 
10. (U)  Not surprisingly, distributors at the roundtable 
seemed most focused on short-term issues.  First on their 
mind was this year\'s periodic tariff reviews, which are 
conducted every four to five years depending on the date of 
each distributor\'s concession contract.  This year, ANEEL 
will conduct 17 tariff reviews with the goal to restore 
\"financial equilibrium\" to distributors, and split 
productivity gains between distributors and consumers. 
During the event distributors lamented that financial 
equilibrium remains an undefined term. 
 
11. (U) In November 2002, ANEEL announced it would use 
companies\' current asset values as the basis for calculating 
the capital value of each distributor, a key component in the 
methodology for conducting the 2003 tariff reviews.  This 
announcement came as a surprise to industry as the GoB had 
used an altogether different basis to determine the capital 
value of each distributor when seeking minimum bid prices 
during privatization in the late 90s.  During that period, 
ANEEL determined the capital value of the company on the 
projected discounted revenue stream of the distributor. 
 
12. (U)  ABRADEE (the primary distributors\' association in 
Brazil) immediately objected to ANEEL\'s proposed use of 
current asset value to determine capital value, and has since 
led the charge against its implementation.  ABRADEE asserts 
that the depreciation in the Brazilian real since 1998 has 
eroded the asset value of sector companies, and that the use 
of this methodology would result in an insufficient increase 
in tariffs.  ABRADEE has proposed instead that the capital 
value of the company be computed as it was for the minimum 
bid prices used during privatization.  An estimated 26 
billion reals over the next five years industry-wide are in 
play in this decision that will lead to either an average 20% 
to 25% tariff increase, if ANEEL\'s methodology is used, or an 
average 40% increase, if ABRADEE\'s is. 
 
13. (U)  ABRADEE has already been dealt an initial defeat as 
two successive federal judges have declined the association\'s 
request for an injunction on the current tariff reviews.  On 
February 17, ANEEL released its formula for the first three 
reviews for public comment.  The agency also stated that 
distributors receiving high tariff adjustments following the 
review would have them implemented in \"parcels\", starting 
this year and continuing into the future in order to lessen 
the impact on consumers. 
 
Short-term Liquidity Crunch 
--------------------------- 
14. (SBU)  For some distributors, short-term liquidity 
problems rank ahead of tariff concerns.  AES, for example, 
has a total Brazil-related debt running into the billions, 
with a large percentage of it short-term and dollar-linked. 
With a depreciated real and 1999 levels of electricity 
demand, AES simply cannot make the receipts to cover its 
debt.  The company also continues to experience large losses 
from municipal government non-payment.  AES told Ambassador 
in a private meeting that municipalities owe 400 million 
reals to AES distributor Eletropaulo alone. 
 
15. (SBU)  Distributors told us that short-term fixes, i.e., 
90-day debt rollovers, are not helpful, and that most 
important is GoB acceptance of companies\' rights to a 
reasonable level of return.  One of their suggestions is to 
increase tariffs on industrial consumers.  Currently, 
Brazil\'s residential consumers pay rates several times that 
of industrial consumers.  While such increases may seem, at 
first glance, more politically acceptable to the new 
left-leaning GoB than increasing the electricity bill of the 
average consumer, roundtable participants told Embassy 
officers that the GoB was not likely to increase rates on 
industrial consumers for fear of reducing their own campaign 
funds. 
 
16. (SBU)  Another option highlighted was a reduction in 
taxes.  Distributors commented that approximately 27 percent 
of consumers\' electricity bills are tax.  The great majority 
of this is ICMS, a state tax.  Distributors told us that the 
corresponding tax burden in the United States was about six 
to seven percent.  However, roundtable participants were 
pessimistic on the prospects of the GoB reducing taxes. 
 
Generators Not Overly Concerned by Single-Buyer Concept 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
17. (U)  As mentioned above, government-mandated rationing, 
abundant rains, and the phased liberalization of 25 percent 
of bilateral electricity contracts has depressed wholesale 
electricity prices.  A longer-term problem facing the 
government is how to diversify Brazil\'s electricity mix.  The 
majority of policy-makers concede that some non-hydro 
generation is desirable to avoid dramatic fluxes as seen 
during the 2001 drought when dry reservoirs in three out of 
Brazil\'s four regions combined with inadequate transmission 
infrastructure to push prices to 650 reals per megawatt on 
the spot market.  However, new thermal plants with higher 
amortization and fuel costs simply cannot compete with older 
hydro plants in normal conditions. 
 
18. (U)  One idea for dealing with price fluctuations and 
creating incentives for future generation investment is MME\'s 
vaguely stated proposal to create a single buyer to trade 
energy between a pool of generators and individual 
distributors.  Theoretically, such a trader would pay thermal 
generators higher prices than amortized hydro plants, thus 
arriving at an unified average cost of energy.  This would 
maintain profitability for thermal generators who face 
difficulties covering their costs when abundant rains make 
hydro cheap.  Going into the roundtable, we had expected to 
hear vehement industry objections to this proposal, but were 
surprised to see generally neutral attitudes on the subject. 
More GoB specifics on this proposal should emerge in upcoming 
months. 
 
Opinions on Current Government Guarded; Access to GOB Good 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
19. (SBU)  Companies told Ambassador that their access to the 
new government has been \"good.\"  They report that Roussef 
appears to be direct, strong-willed, and opinionated, but 
also fair and intelligent.  This echoes what we\'ve been 
hearing in private one-on-one meetings with U.S. companies, 
and reinforces the commonly-held notion that it was Roussef\'s 
drive that achieved the partial resolution wholesale 
electricity market (MAE) accounts in early January.  Roussef 
spent most of her first four weeks in office placing trusted 
advisors in key positions throughout the energy sector.  Now 
that her team is built, Roussef appears to be moving directly 
to reformulation of the electricity sector model.  A 
Brazilian weekly quipped that if the GoB followed the 
McDonald\'s best practices, Roussef would be \"Minister of the 
Month.\" 
 
20. (U) Diligent performance in her first 30 days has raised 
industry expectations of Roussef\'s capabilities, as well as 
industry hope that the GoB \"shares the pain.\"  The GoB does 
indeed appear willing to accept that it has some 
responsibility toward finding a solution for the sector 
crisis.  In a February 6 meeting with econoff and commercial 
officers, Secretary for Energy Marcelo Poppe said the MME has 
formed a working group to present a reformulated model by 
July, with a period of public comment to follow. A report in 
national daily Estado de Sao Paulo on February 13 quoted MME 
Executive Secretary Mauricio Tolmasquim as saying that the 
MME would introduce a package of refinancing intended to 
assist companies to survive until the new model is 
implemented sometime near the end of the year. 
 
Conclusion and Comment 
---------------------- 
21. (SBU)  The future role of private finance in the 
Brazilian electricity sector is unclear, and likely to remain 
so until at least July.  The GoB has already said its future 
model will be a mixed model of public and private investment. 
 It may be that the future MME plan will trade large 
potential profits, private investment, and efficiency gains 
for a less efficient, but more stable sector with lower 
returns.  Eletrobras President Pinguelli Rosa has been quoted 
as saying 15 to 20 percent returns are \"unrealistic,\" and 
praised the French system as more reliable with 5 to 10 
percent returns. 
 
22. (SBU)  Pending the new model\'s definition, the GoB must 
find a way to deal with distributors\' short-term liquidity 
problems.  Many of these private investors are requesting 
that the government (i.e., development bank BNDES, 
Eletrobras, and the state generators) \"take a haircut\" on a 
portion of the distributors\' outstanding debts, some of which 
predate privatization. However, convincing the current GoB to 
write down debts created by its predecessor is an unlikely 
prospect.  Eletrobras has its own stockholders who will balk 
at big bailouts, and though new BNDES President Carlos Lessa 
originally called his organization a \"hospital for sick 
companies,\" his sentiment has been publicly rebutted by 
Minister of Finance Antonio Palocci. 
 
23. (SBU)  The primary alternative to refinancing deals is 
reversion of concessions to the GoB.  Such a move would 
result in long legal challenges, and one also wonders if the 
GoB would really wish to manage these utilities.  Our 
earliest indications are that Roussef herself, despite her 
original extreme-left ideology, now does not want to 
\"refederalize\" companies. 
 
24. (SBU)  Mission will continue to engage U.S. business, and 
maintain open dialogue with the GoB as it formulates its 
model.  We will lend support to ABRADEE\'s proposal for tariff 
revision methodology, and urge options to improve companies\' 
financial health while limiting cost increases to residential 
consumers.  GoB options, in this context, include urging 
local governments to pay up, reducing taxes on electricity, 
and redressing the imbalance between residential and 
industrial tariffs.  Over the longer-term we will seek 
opportunities to strengthen institutions such as ANEEL and 
the MAE, and promote cooperation between policy planning 
organizations such as the Brazilian CNPE (National Council 
for Energy Policy) and the United States Energy Information 
Administration.

SUBJECT:  Brazilian Growth Prospects 
 
Ref. Brasilia 606 
 
1.  (U) Summary.  The Brazilian economy grew a modest 1.5% 
in 2002, as a strong export performance offset falling 
domestic consumption and investment.  The Central Bank 
expects growth will reach 2.8% in 2003, led by trade and 
agriculture and a modest increase in domestic consumption 
and manufacturing.  Many market analysts are more 
skeptical, though, noting that with high interest rates 
there are few new sources of growth that will drive 
economic expansion.  End summary. 
 
2002 Rescued by Trade 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The Brazilian economy grew modestly in 2002, 1.5%, 
while GDP growth per capita was almost flat, 0.2%.  These 
results are almost the same as in 2001 (GDP growth of 1.4%, 
per capita GDP growth of 0.1%). 
 
3.  (U) Growth was spread relatively evenly across the four 
quarters in seasonally adjusted terms, although the fourth 
quarter turned in a relatively impressive year-on-year 
result, 3.4%, in part because production in the the last 
quarter of 2001 was depressed because of the energy crisis. 
 
4.  (U) For the year, agriculture registered the strongest 
growth, 5.8%, while industry and services both came in at 
1.5%.  However, industry did have a strong fourth quarter, 
growing at 6.9%. 
 
5.  (U) A more striking picture about the performance of 
the Brazilian economy in 2002 comes from the demand side. 
For the year, family consumption (-0.7%) and business 
investment (-4.1%) both fell, while the government 
increased by a modest 1.0%.  (Business investment finally 
began to pick up in the fourth quarter, growing 4.2%.) 
However, the real force behind what growth that took place 
was on the trade side, with exports up 7.8% and imports 
down 12.8%.  Together, these two factors contributed 2.8 
percentage points towards growth, offsetting falling 
domestic consumption and investment. 
 
What\'s in Store for 2003? 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) According to the Central Bank\'s survey of market 
analysts, the average GDP growth forecast for 2003 is 2%. 
However, that average disguises a wide range of views on 
2003 growth potential.  In early February, Luis Fernando 
Lopes of JPMorgan increased his forecast to 2.5%, arguing 
that the strong performance by the trade sector should 
continue to pull the economy along, while underplaying the 
impact of interest rate increases, saying that they have 
little impact on the average consumer.  Rodrigo Azevedo of 
Credit Suisse First Boston, on the other hand, estimates 
that growth will only be 1.0% for the year.  He allows that 
the trade sector should be strong, but asserts that it will 
be the only factor for growth, while domestic consumption 
and investment will be suppressed by tight fiscal and 
monetary policy.  Andrei Spacov of Unibanco lowered his 
forecast for 2003 from 2.0% to 1.5% because of the recent 
tightening of monetary policy (reftel). 
 
7.  (SBU) Econoff discussed 2003 growth prospects with 
Altamir Lopes, Chief Economist at the Central Bank.  Lopes 
defended the Central Bank\'s 2.8% growth projection as 
realistic.  He said the projection is based on continued 
growth for agriculture.  He noted that the industrial 
sector had been growing for seven months, and the 2003 
projection does not call for additional acceleration but 
assumes the sector will maintain its reasonable performance 
from the last quarter of 2002 (2.4% growth).  Lopes added 
that that two subsectors, petroleum and electricity, should 
grow rapidly, providing an additional impetus for overall 
growth.  He noted that the construction sector has begun to 
pick up as well, and the Central Bank forecast assumes it 
will continue to grow at a relatively modest 2.4%. 
 
8.  (SBU) On the demand side, Lopes expects continued 
strong growth due to exports and import substitution.  (He 
noted that the impact of growing exports has been magnified 
domestically since, with the depreciation of the real, 
dollar-denominated trade has increased its weight in the 
Brazilian economy.)  Lopes argued that family consumption 
should pick up even with suppressed real wages, pointing to 
increased income in the agricultural sector, increased one- 
time disbursements of unemployment benefits (FGTS), and 
increased social payments under the Lula administration. 
And Lopes expects that certain industries will continue to 
invest, noting that some export industries are operating at 
capacity or are anticipating continued growth. 
 
9.  (SBU) Lopes ended by noting that the 2.8% projection 
assumes little economic fallout from a quick war in the 
Middle East.  He said a protracted war might reduce growth 
by around 0.3 percentage points. 
 
10.  (SBU) Comment.  Lopes highlights a range of factors 
that could sustain growth in 2003, although we would be 
surprised if the economy expands 2.8% this year.  Given 
that domestic consumption and investment has been flat for 
two years because of economic turbulence, we suspect that 
there is significant pent-up demand that could be released 
if the overall economic environment is benign.  That is a 
big if, however, given uncertainties about a war with Iraq 
and the ability of the Lula government to deliver economic 
reform.  On top of that, the government is going to have to 
maintain tight monetary and fiscal policy.  Therefore we 
expect that growth is more likely to be in the range of 
1.5-2.0%, and at most around 2.5% if everything breaks the 
right way.

1.  Summary.  Post recommends that Brazil remain on the 
Priority Watch List for the 2003 Special 301 Review.  New 
attention to entrenched IPR problems, particularly in the 
copyright area, may be forthcoming under the new Lula 
government.  Driven largely by concern over lost tax 
revenues, impact on formal sector jobs, and harm to Brazilian 
artists, the new administration, which assumed office January 
1, has publicly acknowledged rampant piracy and 
counterfeiting to be a Brazilian problem, and has vowed 
action.  However, it is too early to assess the GOB\'s new 
level of commitment.  Furthermore, despite some positive 
groundwork laid by the Cardoso administration, the level of 
IPR enforcement within Brazil remained grossly inadequate 
during the last year.  Despite its new leadership and 
staffing, the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Fighting Piracy 
(IMC) has not yet proven its capacity for effecting 
substantial, tangible improvements in copyright enforcement. 
Likewise, the backlog of pharmaceutical patents continues to 
grow due to the two-step patent application process, which 
requires Ministry of Health approval, and insufficient 
resources within Brazil\'s patent institute.  Maintaining the 
status-quo on Special 301 status for Brazil strikes the 
appropriate balance between recognition of a continued poor 
IPR record, hopes that the new government will tackle the 
issue in earnest, and reinforcement of the USG message that 
IPR remains a priority within our bilateral agenda. 
 
Copyright - The Groundwork 
 
- Inter-Ministerial Committee: An Enigma or Force for Change? 
 
2.  As IIPA notes in its submission, much stock was placed in 
the creation of the Inter-Ministerial Committee to Fight 
Piracy (IMC) in March 2001.  There was an expectation that 
the IMC would provide the vehicle through which the GOB could 
finally articulate and act on a national strategy for 
copyright enforcement.  However, far from being a dynamic 
force for change, the IMC was not a functioning entity in 
2001.  Even GOB officials have acknowledged the IMC\'s less 
than stellar 2001 performance, during a November 2002 
Bilateral Consultative Mechanism meeting and more recently in 
meetings with DOC A/S Lash on February 27.  While copyright 
industries are correct in asserting that tangible results 
still remained elusive in 2002, the following changes in the 
IMC should be noted as having positive potential. 
 
3. In March 2002, a new coordinator, Clovis da Silva 
Monteiro, was named to head the IMC.  Monteiro was tasked 
solely with running the IMC, in contrast to his predecessor, 
who had retained his drug-fighting responsibilities as a 
senior police official in Rio de Janeiro during his IMC 
tenure.  Monteiro established within the Ministry of Justice 
an IMC office staffed with four assistants, and had managed 
to convene 10 IMC meetings by the end of 2002, many with 
private sector representatives.  In November 2002, the IMC 
produced an action plan for 2003 (USTR received a copy during 
the Bilateral Consultative Mechanism meeting the same month). 
 
4. The action plan, a nine-page document, on first read 
appears to suffer from over-generality; actions are only 
described in broad terms.  For example, one action item is to 
examine existing proposals for legislative reform and to 
identify the need to improve other legal texts.  The item 
fails to provide IMC views on specific IPR legislative 
proposals or to identify actions to promote their adoption or 
defeat.  This generality, at least in part, reflects the fact 
that the IMC is a coordinating body ) it does not have the 
authority to direct action by any other government body. 
 
5. As explained by Elza Marcelino de Castro, chief of 
Itamaraty\'s Intellectual Property Division and Itamaraty\'s 
representative to the IMC, specific actions are not 
identified in the IMC action plan because implementation is 
the responsibility of the individual ministries that comprise 
the group.  She notes, for instance, that after IMC 
discussions and consensus, Itamaraty recently sent a note to 
the Brazilian Congress urging action on long-pending 
legislation on integrated circuitry.  She also claims that an 
action plan with greater specificity exists, but is not 
public.  Likewise, it is difficult to find the imprint of the 
IMC on police enforcement actions.  Monteiro, who hails from 
the Federal Police corps, claims to be intimately involved in 
promoting and coordinating police activity country-wide.  He 
admits, however, that he generally obtains results more from 
drawing on his personal credibility and experience within law 
enforcement than as head of the IMC. 
 
6. Monteiro has apparently succeeded in elevating IPR as an 
issue within Mercosul.  Due to his efforts, IPR was included 
for the first time within a Mercosul Presidential Declaration 
during the group\'s summit in Brasilia in December 2002. 
Itamaraty has confirmed that the issue is on the Mercosul 
agenda for follow-up at the ministerial level.  Brazil\'s 
actions in this regard are driven by its concern over pirated 
materials being smuggled across its borders, principally from 
Paraguay. 
 
7. Another action under IMC discussion is formation of a task 
force to deal with counterfeit products.  In a conference on 
IPR enforcement held in Rio de Janeiro in late November 2002, 
tax losses and potential harm to consumers from counterfeit 
products figured prominently.  A representative of Receita 
Federal, the GOB\'s IRS, was quoted extensively on the 
substantial tax losses from counterfeit products, principally 
cigarettes and gasoline.  Given the federal government\'s 
tight budget situation and focus on tax issues, greater GOB 
attention can logically be expected in this area during the 
coming months. 
 
8. The Ministry of Justice is reportedly looking into the 
possibility of forming a task force comprised of 
representatives from the country\'s various police units. 
This would be a welcome complement to the more 
policy-oriented IMC.  Monteiro also claims that the IMC is 
encouraging other municipalities to establish IPR task 
forces, similar to Sao Paulo\'s, but admits that convincing 
local authorities with tight resources that investments 
should be made in this area is an uphill battle. 
 
9. An area of increasing focus by some of the copyright 
industries is Brazil\'s judicial system, in particular, the 
lack of convictions and of deterrent sentencing.  According 
to Itamaraty\'s de Castro, while establishment of separate IPR 
courts is not envisioned, the IMC is discussing how to 
cultivate IPR expertise within the judicial system.  She 
notes, however, that executive branch initiatives in this 
area are not always welcomed by the independent judiciary. 
 
10. While the IMC\'s lack of overarching authority will 
continue to undermine its ability to forcefully carry out a 
nation-wide strategy for improving IPR protection within 
Brazil, it still represents the best vehicle at present for 
focusing IPR enforcement issues at the federal level. 
Private sector associations interested in IPR issues are 
seeking increased involvement in the work of the IMC, with 
some requesting a seat on the committee.  Enhanced 
involvement in the IMC by the private sector could lead to 
better focus and more concrete results. 
 
-Optical Media: New Digital Codes Requirement 
 
11. The promulgation of Presidential Decree 4533 on December 
19, 2002 provides implementing regulations for Article 113 of 
Brazil\'s 1998 Copyright Law concerning identification codes 
for copyright products.  The decree requires that music and 
audiovisual works, whether optically read or not, include 
codes identifying the original work, the production company, 
catalogue number, the lot code and number of copies contained 
within the lot, as well as an International Standard 
Recording Code providing information on the respective 
artists and other information provided by the producer.  The 
decree is due to become effective April 22, 2003. Local 
industry is divided on whether or not this requirement will 
prove to be an effective IPR enforcement tool, or merely a 
mechanism for better accounting between production companies 
and artists.  The local software industry association (ABES), 
for instance, opposes the decree.  However, Castro argues 
that the decree will help reduce illegal sales of works that 
are stolen from legitimate production facilities, which she 
claims have been significant. 
 
Patents ) No Recovery Expected Soon 
 
12.  Despite GOB officials -- such as the acting head of 
Brazil\'s National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI), 
Minister Furlan who oversees INPI as the head of the Ministry 
of Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC), Under-Secretary 
Hugueney of Itamaraty\'s U/S of Integration, Economics and 
Trade, and Senator Mercadante (PT)- recently acknowledging 
the magnitude of the problem, no immediate reduction in the 
pharmaceutical patent backlog is expected.  Firm figures on 
INPI\'s pending patent applications are hard to come by, but 
PhRMA\'s estimate of 45,000 pending patent applications, of 
which approximately 18,000 are pharmaceutical patents, 
appears reasonable. 
 
13. INPI claims the backlog is due to its lack of resources; 
INPI currently has 80 examiners and only a few computer 
terminals.  INPI has requested approval from the central GOB 
to hire 350 examiners over the next five years and expand its 
number of computers.  However, the government\'s tight budget 
situation casts doubt on the likelihood of this occurring. 
Even Itamaraty\'s de Castro admitted to econoff that without a 
dramatic increase in resources for INPI, the patent backlog 
will persist for many years.  INPI is currently training 27 
new examiners, 20 of which will reportedly focus on 
pharmaceutical patents.  The required approval of the 
Ministry of Health\'s regulatory agency, ANVISA, in addition 
to raising TRIPS compliance concerns, also adds to patent 
processing uncertainty and delays.  However, in a February 27 
meeting with DOC A/S Lash, Hugueney reported that the GOB 
will be initiating a review in March of its policy regarding 
ANVISA\'s role in the patent approval process. 
 
Biotechnology 
 
14. As noted in the American Soybean Association\'s (ASA) 
Special 301 submission, piracy associated with Roundup Ready 
has been a burgeoning trend.  Past denial by the GOB of the 
existence of illegal plantings of Roundup Ready, which is 
estimated to have reached as high as 70 to 90 percent of the 
soybean crop in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, has hindered 
Monsanto\'s ability to exercise its patent rights.  The Lula 
administration has recently recognized the widespread use of 
Roundup Ready and is deliberating on what to do about the 
\"illegal\" GMO plantings within the 2002-2003 crop.  It is 
unclear at this point to what extent if any this 
acknowledgment of the pervasive use of Roundup Ready will 
assist Monsanto in pursuing its patent claims. 
 
TRIPS Compliance: Data Confidentiality 
 
15. On December 17, 2002, the Brazilian Congress passed Law 
10,603 intending to bring the data confidentiality portions 
of the industrial property law fully in line with TRIPS.  The 
law provides data protection for 10 years from the date of 
patent registration for products utilizing new chemical 
molecules or new biological organisms or until the first 
release of the information by the patent holder, with a 
minimum guaranteed period of protection of one year.  For 
products not utilizing new molecule or organisms, the period 
of protection is five years or until the first release of 
information by the patent holder with a one-year minimum 
period of protection.  For data generated after patent 
registration, the period of protection will coincide with the 
patent period or one year from when the data was divulged, 
whichever is longer.  USTR is evaluating whether or not the 
legislation is TRIPS compliant. 
 
Treaty Ratification 
 
16. Itamaraty has confirmed that the GOB does not currently 
have plans to ratify the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty or the 
WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. 
 
Recommendation 
 
17. Post believes that the lack of tangible improvements in 
IPR protection and enforcement in the last year manifestly 
precludes lowering Brazil\'s Special 301 status.  We concur 
with industry submissions that suggest that retaining Brazil 
as a Priority Watch List country will appropriately highlight 
for the new government the importance of the issue in our 
bilateral relationship, without appearing to prejudge its 
policies and actions in this area.  Nonetheless, we request 
that, should Brazil\'s status be maintained, USTR\'s 
announcement highlight the USG\'s recognition of the positive 
intentions expressed by the Lula administration regarding IPR 
and the USG\'s desire to work collaboratively with it to 
improve its IPR regime in the coming year.

REF: SECSTATE 50753 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
1. (U) Econoff met on March 12 with Felipe Hees of the 
Services, Investment and Financial Issues Division of 
Itamaraty to discuss prospects for Brazil\'s submission of 
services offers in the WTO (reftel) and FTAA negotiations. 
 
WTO - Submission by Deadline Is Doubtful 
 
2. (U) Although Hees stressed that a final decision has not 
been made, he confirmed reports that Brazil may not submit a 
WTO services offer by March 31.  The hold-up would not be 
technical.  Echoing comments made by Brazilian negotiators in 
Geneva, Hees explained that the GOB is considering the 
tactical pros and cons of withholding its services offer to 
protest what it views as a lack of progress in areas of vital 
interest for Brazil.  The most important of these areas is 
agriculture, and the GOB sees little prospect that modalities 
for the agriculture negotiations will be agreed to by the 
March 31 deadline.  Hees laid blame for the difficulties in 
the agriculture negotiations squarely on the European Union 
(EU).  Econoff noted USG concerns that momentum for the Doha 
Development Agenda (DDA) may unravel if a mounting number of 
benchmarks are missed, but Hees responded that without 
movement by the EU in agriculture, the DDA is dead anyway. 
In discussions with Ambassador on March 17, Foreign Minister 
Amorim suggested that if Brazil does submit a services offer 
by March 31, it will be modest. 
 
3. (U) While Brazil\'s principal focus is agriculture, Hees 
claimed that missed deadlines in other sensitive areas (TRIPS 
and Public Health, Special and Differential Treatment), and 
low expectations for results on rules (antidumping, etc.) all 
make it extremely difficult for the GOB to domestically 
defend moving forward in negotiating areas where its posture 
is more \"defensive.\"  He restated the GOB position that all 
areas of the DDA must progress together, rejecting as 
improbable that a satisfactory agreement would result if 
evaluation of the negotiations as a single-undertaking only 
transpires at the end of the process. 
 
FTAA - Services Lever 
 
4. (SBU) The GOB has already decided to use its services 
offer within the FTAA as a tactical lever.  According to 
Hees, the GOB had prepared its offer for the February 15 
deadline, but it was withheld at the last minute by order of 
Foreign Minister Amorim, with the acquiescence of President 
Lula.  While claiming that he is not privy to Minister 
Amorim\'s reasoning, Hees said he understood from 
conversations within the Ministry that the decision was a 
reaction to disappointment with other aspects of the FTAA 
negotiations. In particular, he noted the GOB\'s very negative 
reaction to Canada\'s market access offers for goods, because 
it excluded 97 agricultural products, including many key 
Brazilian exports. 
GOB Demands Respect 
 
5. (U) Leaving aside Brazil\'s decision to delay submission of 
its offer, Hees used the opportunity to express frustration 
with the U.S. approach in FTAA services negotiations.  His 
core accusation was that discussions between the U.S. and 
Mercosul delegations are less than frank, within plenary as 
well as within bilateral meetings.  He was particularly vexed 
by what he portrayed as a lack of forthrightness in the way 
the initial U.S. services offer was characterized in Panama. 
According to Hees, the U.S. delegation described the U.S. 
offer in plenary as covering \"all levels of the USG,\" but 
that after reading the text, the Mercosul delegation 
concluded that it does not.  To illustrate, Hees cited an 
exception given in Annex 1 (p.17) that allowed all 
sub-federal levels of government to enact legislation that 
did not accord national treatment.   By his read, this means 
that any state within the United States would be able to 
enact legislation that discriminates against Brazilian 
service providers, without violating USG commitments.  Hees 
said the GOB recognizes that the U.S. government structure 
poses challenges for devising services commitments; he 
suggested that the GOB would display more understanding 
regarding this difficulty, if the exchanges between the U.S. 
and Mercosul delegations would be more candid.  He also 
claimed that information provided on U.S. willingness to 
negotiate Mode 4 concessions was misleading.  Hees stressed 
that more candid exchanges between the delegations could 
reduce friction and help move the negotiations forward 
through productive dialog. 
6. (U) Hees also termed the U.S. \"mantra\" that offers be 
constructed as \"negative\" lists as a source of friction. 
Hees claimed that the GOB has not yet rejected the 
possibility of using a negative list.  However, he asserted 
that the U.S. delegation\'s insistence that the negative list 
approach be adopted, without the benefit of a substantive 
discussion of the pros and cons of other approaches, forces 
Brazil to react defensively, taking a similarly rigid stance 
in favor of a positive list.  More or less, Hees said that 
Brazil has to be convinced ) not told -- that a negative 
list approach is better.  He noted that Peru and Colombia had 
constructed their offers in yet different ways and thought 
these approaches might also have something to offer to the 
debate. 
 
7. (U) Hees argued that the premise that a negative list 
provides for more comprehensive commitments is basically 
flawed, noting that some negative list offers submitted by 
FTAA countries were far from comprehensive ) the devil being 
in the details of the annexes ) including for future 
services.  Countries intent on liberalizing can do so under 
either approach, just as countries can also opt for keeping 
their markets closed, he opined.  Furthermore, he claimed 
that a negative list, at least according to the U.S. offer, 
provides less, not more, specificity regarding restrictions. 
He noted an annex entry covering \"all sectors,\" which 
identified applicable U.S. laws, but without indicating how 
the laws would affect provision of the services in the 
sector; there was no mention of the specific subsectors or 
modes affected.  Expanding on this, Hees argued that there is 
also real value to sticking to a system (GATS) that 
government officials throughout the hemisphere now know how 
to read and use, pointing out that they will have to be able 
to explain to their exporters in detail what services 
openings and restrictions they will face. 
 
8. (U) In a final note, Hees asked that due respect be given 
to Brazil considering the extent to which services have 
already been liberalized in the country.  Hees complained 
that the U.S. appears to approach Brazil much in the same way 
as it approaches countries with closed services sectors, he 
presumes because constitutional difficulties prevented 
ratification of Brazil\'s GATS commitments.  He suggested that 
acknowledgment of Brazil\'s current openness would create a 
more positive environment for Brazil to consider requests for 
improving access.

THE NEGOTIATIONS 
 
 
 SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1. (U) Brazilian press reported on March 28 that President 
Lula wants to include discussion of social issues in the FTAA 
negotiations and that the GOB plans to submit proposals for 
doing so at the Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) meeting in 
Puebla, Mexico April 7-11.  In discussions with EconOff on 
March 31, Tovar da Silva Nunes, head of the FTAA Coordinating 
Office in the Ministry of Foreign Relations (Itamaraty), 
identified six social issues that the GOB will propose be 
addressed formally within the FTAA process: employment, 
environment, small and medium enterprises, poverty, family 
agriculture, and cultural values.  (Note: the inclusion of 
family agriculture is consistent with recent statements by 
the Brazilian Agriculture Minister that indicate the GOB may 
be softening its opposition in trade negotiations toward 
certain domestic support programs that are designed to aid 
family farms.)  The GOB also plans to propose that all FTAA 
market access offers be made available on the internet. 
 
2. (SBU) According to Tovar, Brazil will be vetting a 
proposal to include discussion of these social issues within 
the FTAA with its Mercosul partners in meetings April 3-4 in 
Asuncion.  He indicated that the GOB plans to put forward the 
concept in Puebla, with the expectation that consensus on 
establishing a mechanism may not be reached until the next 
TNC. 
 
3. (SBU) Tovar suggested that one way these issues could be 
inserted into the FTAA process would be to hold separate, 
hemispheric conferences for each theme.  The products of 
these discussions could then be provided to Ministers for 
their consideration, without obligation.  \"Brazilian civil 
society\" reportedly identified these areas as those for which 
a better understanding of the implications of the FTAA are 
needed said Tovar without further elaboration.  He claimed 
that the GOB does not have preconceived notions about what 
might emerge from such discussions.  He also did not indicate 
if the intention is that this activity would fall under the 
existing FTAA Committee of Government Representatives on 
Participation of Civil Society. 
 
4. (SBU) Tovar argued that discussions of these issues at a 
hemispheric level could yield a deeper, more valuable 
discourse, particularly since many issues transcend national 
boundaries.  A widespread negative perception of the FTAA 
still persists in Brazilian civil society, largely, Tovar 
argued, out of fear of the unknown.  He claims that what NGOs 
want is \"access\" to the process, to better understand it and 
its implications.  While not expecting that the most 
outspoken critics will ever offer explicit endorsements of 
the FTAA, he confided that Itamaraty\'s objective is to at 
least mute their criticism by incorporating them into the 
process. 
 
5. (SBU) COMMENT: Comments Tovar made suggest that the 
proposal also reflects the heavy burden that Itamaraty is 
being asked to take on regarding expanded domestic 
consultations.  President Lula has publicly committed to 
national discussion and debate, not only on trade policy, but 
across the policy board.  Especially on trade, however, where 
experience does not run deep in the PT government leadership, 
the President is determined to ensure that government actions 
are in tune with his social agenda, and to use expansive 
consultations to achieve that aim.  Itamaraty feels under 
pressure to increase its outreach to NGOs, labor unions, the 
Church and other actors in civil society, as well as 
Congress.  At the same time, it is having to expand internal 
government consultations.  For instance, consideration is 
being given to expanding the GOB trade decision-making body 
(CAMEX) to include two additional ministries - Environment 
and Labor.   (The six ministers that currently comprise CAMEX 
are Itamaraty; Development, Industry and Trade; Agriculture; 
Finance; Planning; and Casa Civil (Presidency)).  Itamaraty 
may be hoping that a hemispheric process would help lighten 
the load of domestic consultation.  However, Brazilian civil 
society may not be so easily co-opted.  NGO reps have 
recently been quoted as complaining not about access to trade 
negotiators, but that their ideas have not been incorporated 
into Brazilian negotiating positions.   END COMMENT. 
 
6. (SBU) On market access issues, Tovar took the opportunity 
to state that Itamaraty is still in the process of explaining 
Brazilian offers and their implications internally to leaders 
in the new government, many of whom are uncomfortable with 
what they clearly do not understand.  Itamaraty\'s tactic at 
this point is for Brazil to remain a participant within the 
process by submitting offers, but ones which will be very 
modest.  For instance, its services offer is expected to 
merely reflect existing law, as will probably the investment 
and government procurement offers, although new carve outs to 
support small and medium enterprises and family farms may be 
included in the government procurement offer. 
 
7. (SBU) The GOB hopes to convince its Mercosul partners this 
week to adopt the same minimalist approach.  If successful, 
it will announce in Puebla its readiness to put forward 
services, investment and government procurement offers. 
Note: Brazil was able to persuade Argentina to hold back its 
services offer at the last minute in mid-February, but not 
Paraguay and Uruguay; it is unclear whether or not they will 
all follow Brazil\'s lead this time. Within the GOB, there is 
not uniform endorsement of the minimalist approach. 
Reportedly, the Finance Ministry (recognizing the benefits of 
expanded trade for the economy, according to Tovar) and the 
Agriculture Ministry (which wants increased access for 
competitive products) are pushing for more ambitious offers 
with Itamaraty and the Ministry of Development taking a more 
cautious approach. 
 
8. (SBU) Meanwhile the Lula administration is reflecting on 
various scenarios concerning the FTAA, WTO and Mercosul-EU 
trade negotiations as it struggles to define a comprehensive 
trade strategy, a process they hope to complete within the 
next couple months.  Tovar noted what he called progress made 
recently in the more advanced Mercosul-EU trade negotiations 
and indicated that movement in these talks in some ways will 
make it easier for the GOB to move in the WTO and FTAA, if in 
no other way, because of substantial technical work already 
completed by the GOB.  Tovar voiced optimism that the GOB 
will be in a position to move more substantively on FTAA 
market access by the summer. 
 
9. (U) Tovar also noted that the GOB was having difficulty 
evaluating the U.S. goods offer due to technical problems. 
In particular, he mentioned that the U.S. notified base rates 
using HS 2002 nomenclature, but that the offer was provided 
in 1996 nomenclature.  According to Tovar, 924 products were 
notified for which they cannot find a corresponding tariff 
line in the offer, and there were 18 items where the converse 
is true.  He also complained that the trade value statistics 
provided for the U.S. offer were for 2001 instead of 2002.

1. (SBU) Summary.  According to Antonio Simoes, Economic 
Advisor to Foreign Minister Amorim, local press inaccurately 
reported Amorim\'s April 23 remarks to the Brazilian Chamber 
of Deputies concerning the GoB\'s alleged intent to delay FTAA 
negotiations.  Simoes stressed to us that the GoB wants to 
continue negotiating with the United States within the FTAA; 
that it is not seeking an extension of the end of 2004 
deadline for negotiations; but that the GoB can be expected 
to raise the possibility of limited four plus one 
negotiations as a politically important supplement to the 
FTAA, during USTR Zoellick\'s trip to Brasilia May 27-28.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) In an April 23 telcon, Antonio Simoes, Economic 
Advisor to Foreign Minister Amorim, alerted EconOff that 
Amorim had made remarks earlier that day to the Chamber of 
Deputies which would have implications for the impending 
visit by USTR Zoellick.  The next day, four major dailies ran 
articles reporting on Amorim\'s remarks.  While each was 
slightly different in detail, the central message conveyed 
was that Brazil wanted to slow down the FTAA negotiations and 
seek an extension of the January 2005 deadline for 
completion.  Headlines included \"Brazil Going to Delay the 
FTAA\" and the \"Chancellor Disagrees with the U.S. on the 
FTAA.\"  In response to questions about public remarks here on 
April 22 by Treasury Secretary Snow concerning the U.S. 
position vis--vis negotiation of agricultural domestic 
support disciplines within the FTAA, Amorim\'s response 
generated a headline \"Amorim Warns Against the Siren,s Song 
of The FTAA.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Simoes assured EconOff early April 24 that the press 
reports were incomplete and inaccurate.   Simoes insisted 
that the GoB is not seeking to delay the FTAA negotiations 
and/or to extend the deadline.  He explained that Amorim had 
simply said that immediately after taking office, President 
Lula had slowed down the negotiating pace in order for his 
new government to have time to conduct an evaluation of the 
negotiations -- not that this is the plan for the future. 
Furthermore, Amorim\'s remarks concerning the negotiation 
calendar, according to Simoes, referred solely to the 
timeframe for submission of offers, which the GoB felt had 
been too tight and needed to be extended; Amorim was not 
referring to the end date for negotiations. 
 
4. (SBU) According to Simoes, Amorim did not want to 
criticize Secretary Snow, but had to respond to questions 
raised by Deputies based on press reports that the Secretary 
had not only reiterated the USG position that \"everything is 
on the table\" but had in addition specifically asserted that 
the United States is willing to discuss reductions in 
domestic farm support within the FTAA.  Simoes said that 
Amorim knew the press reports were an inaccurate reflection 
of the U.S. position and needed to convey that to the 
Deputies.  This led to the Minister\'s warning not to be lured 
by the sirens\' song of \"everything is on the table\" and to 
his criticism that Secretary Snow\'s declaration had \"little 
substance\" and \"low credibility.\"   The Minister reportedly 
reassured Deputies that what matters is how the revised U.S. 
offer in July treats products of interest to Brazil. 
 
5. (SBU) Simoes wanted to draw our attention to Amorim\'s 
remarks that the GoB is studying the possibility of 
negotiating a more limited U.S.-Mercosul (or four-plus-one) 
trade agreement and that we should expect Amorim to raise 
this with USTR Zoellick during their discussions in late May. 
 Although qualifying that this is but one possibility that 
the GoB is exploring, Simoes opined that Zoellick should be 
in a position to respond to such an idea during the May 
talks.  He stressed that the GoB would not envision this 
negotiation supplanting the FTAA, but rather as supplementing 
it.  GoB thinking, according to Simoes, is that success in 
negotiating a more limited agreement with the United States 
would divert domestic attention from the FTAA, reduce the 
negative pressure associated with the FTAA, and provide the 
GoB with political space it needs to move forward on those 
negotiations.  (COMMENT: The Lula team has been kicking the 
idea of a U.S.-Mercosul agreement around since as early as 
last October, but has yet to act formally on it or provide 
details.  EconOff noted to Simoes that it may be difficult to 
obtain a substantive response lacking a more definitive 
description of what is envisioned.  END COMMENT.) 
6. (SBU) To provide context, Simoes described the GoB\'s 
difficult political situation regarding the FTAA.  First, 
groups that have promoted the negative perception surrounding 
the FTAA are, in the current administration, in positions to 
wield more political clout.  Simoes declined to identify 
individuals, but Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes, the Secretary 
General within Itamaraty, is certainly in this camp.  Second, 
those trying to promote the FTAA negotiations within and 
outside the administration find little that they can 
definitively point to as a \"win\" for Brazil to counter FTAA 
opponents\'claims that the FTAA is designed to benefit only 
the United States.  The well-known analysis goes like this: 
the current framework for negotiations includes the areas of 
interest to the United States -- services, investment, 
government procurement, intellectual property rights, to name 
some -- but, Brazil has been unable to include the issues of 
interest to it, namely disciplines on agricultural domestic 
support, and trade remedies. 
 
7. (SBU) Making things still worse, according to Simoes, the 
United States presented initial market access offers for 
goods which not only provide Mercosul with the worst tariff 
liberalization schedule, but, within that schedule, have 
their main products of interest in Basket D, the group with 
an as yet undefined timeline for tariff elimination.  The 
United States\' differentiated offers have contributed to a 
hardening of anti-FTAA sentiment among those opposing 
Brazil\'s participation in the negotiations. 
 
8. (SBU) Simoes also noted that local press omitted to report 
on the severe criticism that Amorim received from a group of 
radical PT Deputies, led by Luciana Genro (Rio Grande do 
Sul), who attacked the government for continuing to negotiate 
the FTAA when 10 million Brazilians had already voted against 
it in a plebiscite last fall.  This same group of PT 
ideologues claimed to be forming a \"parliamentary front\" to 
push for a nation-wide referendum on continuing with FTAA 
negotiations.  As relayed by Simoes, Amorim stood up to these 
deputies, unequivocally arguing that it is in Brazil,s 
interests to negotiate the FTAA and that the government would 
continue that course. 
 
9. (SBU) Concerns similar to Simoes\' regarding the political 
landscape for FTAA negotiations, were expressed by Brazil\'s 
new lead FTAA negotiator, Ambassador Carlos Simas Magalhaes, 
during a meeting with visiting Congressman English and his 
delegation later the same day.  At the outset of that 
meeting, Simas catalogued the usual litany of technical 
problems facing Brazil -- a new administration with a new 
team that has had the huge task of reevaluating in technical 
terms each area of the negotiations; the particular 
difficulties posed by investment and government procurement, 
since Brazil,s specialists have never negotiated market 
access in these areas previously; and so on. 
 
10. (SBU) By the end of the meeting, however, Simas suggested 
that technical difficulties can be overcome and that in the 
current Brazilian environment the main obstacles to the FTAA 
are mainly political.  He reminded the Congressman that the 
Lula government is leftist and has different sensitivities 
than the previous administration.  Echoing Simoes\' concern 
over the negative political impact of what has been widely 
seen as inadequate U.S. offers, Simas wondered aloud why the 
United States could not have allowed other countries 
benefiting from preference programs or bilateral trade 
agreements to merely continue with those preferences during 
the FTAA transition period, while putting forward a single 
FTAA offer and saving Mercosul, and especially Brazil, from 
these political difficulties.  Simas, like Simoes, said the 
GoB is considering proposing a four-plus-one agreement with 
the United States, but that it would probably be limited in 
scope and leave aside the more contentious issues. 
COMMENT 
----------------- 
 
11.  (SBU) For some who have followed Brazil\'s attitude 
toward the FTAA negotiations over the years, the current host 
of GoB complaints and concerns seem familiar and could be 
dismissed as GoB positioning rather than a signal of a 
critical impasse.  However, the context in which the GoB, and 
in particular Itamaraty, are now formulating policy is 
dramatically different from the past.  While Lula has gained 
support for continuation within the FTAA negotiations from 
some groups traditionally opposed, such as the large labor 
union CUT, new elements of staunch opposition to the FTAA 
have now taken up residence within the GoB, rather than 
remaining principally in vocal opposition parties and NGOs. 
This is particularly evident in Itamaraty, whose internal 
struggles over FTAA policy have been the subject of several 
speculative press reports recently.   Post understands that 
for now, Ambassador Hugueney, a proponent of the FTAA, 
retains overall responsibility for the FTAA negotiations, 
despite articles reporting otherwise.  However, there is no 
guarantee he will remain for the long-term.  Septel will 
expand on Mission\'s take concerning FTAA status within GoB 
and options Washington may wish to consider in that light and 
in the run up to USTR Zoellick\'s visit.

SUBJECT: MAGALHAES WIRETAPPING CASE GOES TO SENATE FLOOR 
 
REF: A. BRASILIA 0566 
     B. BRASILIA 0825 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  On April 30, the leadership of the 
Brazilian Senate refused to order the opening of expulsion 
proceedings against Senator Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (PFL) 
for allegedly ordering hundreds of illegal phone taps against 
his political opponents in his home state of Bahia.  The 
decision by the leadership, led by Magalhaes\' ally Jose 
Sarney, was not unexpected and kicks the case back to the 
Senate floor.  Magalhaes\' legal and ethics problems are far 
from over, and with political winds buffeting each step of 
the way, it is too early to say whether the Senator will 
suffer punishment or \"have a pizza\" and skate away unscathed. 
 In any case, Magalhaes\' popularity is unshaken in Bahia. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) The ethics case of Senator Antonio Carlos Magalhaes 
(\"ACM\"), the powerful political boss from Bahia, ground 
forward this week as the seven-member Senate leadership 
board, led by Senate President and longtime ACM ally Jose 
Sarney (PMDB-Amapa), refused to order the opening of 
expulsion proceedings in the Senate\'s Ethics Committee.  This 
decision is part of the torturous path that the case has 
followed since exploding in the national press in January. 
The case began in late 2001, a few months after Magalhaes 
resigned from the Senate for an unrelated earlier ethics 
violation.  He then allegedly ordered more than 200 illegal 
phone taps of his political enemies as well as the 
wiretapping and harassment of a young woman who broke off a 
relationship with him (reftels).  He was reelected to the 
Senate in October 2002. 
 
3. (SBU) The case unfolded in public after Magalhaes took 
some of the juicier tidbits that he learned through the 
wiretaps to the press in order to smear his enemies.  The 
Senate Ethics Committee, prodded by the victims of the 
wiretaps and the radical wing of the PT party, then opened a 
preliminary investigation.  Last week, after several weeks of 
hearing witnesses and reviewing the police report, the 
Committee voted 8 to 7 to recommend opening formal expulsion 
proceedings.  This recommendation went to the Senate 
leadership board led by Senate President Sarney for a 
decision.  In a hurried meeting late on April 30, the 
leadership voted 5 to 2 to reject the recommendation.  While 
the voting, both in the Ethics Committee and the leadership 
board, followed expected party lines, the leadership sought 
to justify its decision not to open expulsion proceedings by 
announcing that ACM should receive only a reprimand for the 
ethics violation, while the criminal charges would be decided 
by the Supreme Court once the police finish their 
investigation. 
 
4. (SBU) Given the party makeup of the leadership board and 
Sarney\'s views, the April 30 decision was not unexpected, and 
it does not kill the chance that ACM will be expelled.  Under 
congressional rules, the full Senate can vote to override the 
leadership\'s decision, and PT party leader Tiao Viana has 
promised to introduce such a motion in the coming days. 
There is no certainty that a motion to force expulsion 
proceedings will pass on the floor.  A preliminary count puts 
about 30 Senators for and 30 against, with about 20 still in 
play.  If the motion does not pass, the ethics case against 
ACM will come to a close, likely with some sort of minor 
reprimand.  The police investigation is ongoing and could, at 
least theoretically, lead to a court conviction. 
 
5. (SBU) But if the floor motion passes, then the Ethics 
Committee would open formal proceedings, at which point ACM 
would no longer have the option of resigning his seat to keep 
his political rights.  The Ethics Committee has already voted 
against ACM once, and given the weight of evidence made 
public, it is conceivable that he could be expelled from the 
Senate and stripped him of the right to run for public office 
for eight years.  But the denouement is months down the road, 
and ACM and his allies will use every political and 
parliamentary trick to keep him in the Senate. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT.  Though diminished, Magalhaes remains one 
of Brazil\'s most powerful figures.  He has dominated the 
state of Bahia and the national PFL party for nearly five 
decades, and recent polling shows that his popularity remains 
intact in the state.  The fact that months after the 
revelation that he masterminded an enormous wiretapping 
scheme and mercilessly harassed a young woman who broke off a 
romance with him, the Senate is still dithering over whether 
to even open ethics proceedings is testimony to the 
complicated political expedience that dominates the Brazilian 
congress.  Those in ACM\'s camp --the PFL plus many in the 
PMDB and PSDB parties-- are working overtime to stall or 
shelve the proceedings.  Meanwhile, the PT has been 
surprisingly ambivalent.  Leading PT Senator Aloizio 
Mercadante alternately speaks of the importance of political 
probity and of the need to keep the Senate agenda free of 
distractions.  The PT is surely calculating that ACM, who 
supported Lula in the 2002 elections, will be key to passing 
the administration\'s high-stakes pension and tax reform bills 
that went to Congress this week. 
 
7. (SBU) In the Brazilian political lexicon, a corrupt 
politician who escapes punishment is said to be having a 
pizza.  Pundits are now running recipes for vatapa pizza 
(vatapa being a traditional Bahian dish).  It is widely 
accepted that ACM did what he is accused of doing.  Even the 
lead police investigator commented, \"Every street vendor in 
Bahia knows who ordered the wiretaps.\"  The question is 
whether he will have to pay the price for his actions.

Ref.  State 100283 
 
1.  Reftel requests post\'s response to a survey on fiscal 
transparency and accountability in order to provide a 
report required by PL 108-7.  Below is response for Brazil, 
keyed to questionnaire in paragraph 7 of reftel. 
 
a.  3.  The government publishes a budget with minimum 
delay. 
 
b.  Yes, the combined fiscal position of subnational 
governments is published.  The Central Bank publishes 
monthly data on the combined surpluses/deficits of sub- 
federal governments with a three-week lag based on changes 
in public sector debt balances.  More detailed information, 
based on cash flow reports by states and municipalities, is 
harder to obtain and has a much longer lag. 
 
c.  The budget is published in the official gazette and is 
available on the internet.  The government provides 
detailed summaries of the budget and budget amendments to 
the media. 
 
d.  3.  The federal government has an excellent system of 
budget reporting, and is assisting subnational governments 
improve their budget reporting systems.  Actual budget 
expenditures typically are less than budgeted by congress. 
 
e.  Basic budget procedures are established in the 1988 
Constitution.  The 2000 Fiscal Responsibility Law 
establishes stringent budget guidelines and reporting 
requirements.  The 2000 Fiscal Crime Law establishes 
criminal penalties for public officials that fail to comply 
with specific budget requirements. 
 
f.  3.  There are detailed laws/regulations establishing 
fiscal transparency. 
 
g.  3.  The Fiscal Responsibility Law and Fiscal Crime Law 
entered into force in 2000.  Public officials are 
notionally subject to criminal penalties if they fail to 
comply with the law.  The vast majority of public officials 
appear to take the Fiscal Responsibility Law seriously, 
although the criminal penalties of the Fiscal Crime Law 
have yet to be invoked. 
 
h.  3.  Distribution of tax powers and expenditure 
responsibilities is clear and supported by open and stable 
intergovernmental transfer mechanisms. 
 
i.  Yes, there are independent auditing bodies at the 
federal and state level, although the commissioners are 
appointed by the executive. 
 
j.  3.  Publicly owned entities are under clear control of 
the central government budget process.  A possible weak 
point is lending by government-owned banks, but the banks 
are subject to same regulatory requirements as private 
banks, and subsidized lending is supposed to be covered by 
transfers from the government. 
 
k.  3.  Privatization processes are fully transparent and 
comprehensively reported. 
 
l.  3.  Budget revenue and expenditure estimates are very 
reliable, although a recent increase in inflation has added 
a small degree of uncertainty to revenue forecasts. 
 
m.  Since 1998 the Government of Brazil has been committed 
to fiscal discipline and transparency, first under the 
Cardoso administration and now under the Lula 
administration.  The Fiscal Responsibility Law, passed in 
2000, also imposes stringent requirements on state and 
municipal governments, most of whom take these 
responsibilities seriously.  Fiscal responsibility at the 
subnational level is reinforced by debt rescheduling 
agreements that most states and many municipalities have 
with the federal government.  These agreements establish 
certain budget requirements and give the federal government 
the right to withhold transfers to states and 
municipalities that are in arrears on debt payments. 
 
n.  The U.S. government does not have any programs in 
Brazil that promote accurate disclosure of revenues and 
expenditures.  The IMF and World Bank have worked with the 
federal and subfederal governments on improving fiscal 
management.

in the Foreign Ministry, on 
Brazil\'s participation in the FTAA negotiations.  A number of

negotiations, and tying the FTAA negotiations to a parallel, 
more limited four-plus-one 
(Mercosul-U.S.) agreement.  FTAA skeptics within Brazil\'s 
Ministry of Foreign 
Relations (Itamaraty) appear pitted against certain other

is expected to convene an 
interministerial meeting to forge a policy consensus before 
USTR Zoellick\'s arrival. 
Itamaraty has indicated that USTR Zoellick should be prepared 
to discuss the possibility 
of a four-plus-one negotiation during his meeting with 
Minister Amorim on May 28.  End

Who\'s In Charge? 
--------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Despite campaign rhetoric asserting that the FTAA 
would result in Brazil\'s 
\"annexation\" to the United States, President Lula after 
assuming power quickly 
committed to continuing negotiations in good faith.  However, 
the GoB\'s commitment to 
the negotiations came under new question following Brazil\'s 
decision not to submit 
initial offers in the areas of services, investment and 
government procurement according 
to the previous negotiation schedule.  Since then, the 
internal policy debates have plainly 
intensified. 
 
4. (C) Major re-casting of the GoB\'s official attitudes could 
be on the way. 
Reorganization and personnel changes within Itamaraty have 
placed officials with known 
anti-FTAA sentiments in apparent de facto control of Brazil\'s 
negotiating team.  Leading 
this group is Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes, currently the number 
two at Itamaraty as 
Secretary-General.  Pinheiro Guimaraes was exiled to an 
 
SIPDIS 
academic sinecure by then- 
Foreign Minister Celso Lafer during the previous 
administration because of his 
outspoken public posture against the FTAA.  Guimaraes\' 
advisor, Regis Percy Arslanian, 
was part of the Brazilian delegation attending the recent 
Trade Negotiating Committee 
meeting in Puebla, Mexico; Arslanian was DCM of Brazil\'s 
Embassy in Washington 
until 2001. 
 
5. (C) In what appears to be a consolidation of control, in 
early May, responsibility for 
FTAA negotiations was removed from Clodoaldo Hugueney, 
Undersecretary General for 
Integration, Economy and Trade Affairs and previously 
co-chair of the FTAA at the vice- 
ministerial level along with DUSTR Peter Allgeier.  In the 
move, FTAA as well as 
Mercosul-EU negotiations were shifted to Itamaraty\'s new 
Undersecretariat for South 
America Affairs (ref a), headed by Luiz Felipe Macedo Soares, 
Brazil\'s former 
Ambassador to Mexico.  On May 14, Hugueney\'s assistant, 
Pompeu Neto, implied that 
Hugueney was removed because of his pro-FTAA views; Hugueney 
had argued 
unsuccessfully that Brazil should comply with the schedule 
for initial offers. 
 
6. (U) On May 16, Itamaraty announced that Adhemar Bahadian, 
Brazil\'s Consul 
General in Buenos Aires and a personal friend of Minister 
Amorim and Pinheiro 
Guimaraes, would take over the FTAA co-chair 
responsibilities.  Bahadian is reported to 
have extensive trade experience including negotiations under 
GATT, work at the World 
Intellectual Property Organization and he served as Amorim\'s 
alternate in the WTO from 
2000 to 2002.  Bahadian was a Brazilian point person on 
Summit of the Americas in the 
late nineties and has served a total of ten years at the 
United Nations.  He was an 
Embassy contact while he was Chief of Staff for the Secretary 
General from 1994 to 
1996.  Carlos Alberto Simas Magalhaes will remain Brazil\'s 
lead FTAA negotiator, a 
position to which he was named in February by the new GoB. 
 
Internal Policy Debate 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Pinheiro Guimaraes\' evidently ascending role over 
FTAA policy within Itamaraty 
does not bode well for close, collaborative efforts on FTAA. 
Neto expressed to us his 
judgment that the intellectual formation of Pinheiro 
Guimaraes and his allies dates back 
to the seventies and is characterized by suspicion that the 
United States aims to dominate 
the hemisphere, as well as by an inward-focus relating to 
economic development. 
Despite the economic benefits that Brazil could gain through 
an FTAA, Neto claims that 
these decision-makers are guided by their suspicion and 
ideological aversion to projects 
supported by the United States. 
 
8. (C) In a strange twist, other ministries within the 
government now seem to be out in 
front of Itamaraty on trade liberalization.  After Finance 
Minister Palocci\'s recent trip to 
Washington, press reported (and Neto has confirmed to us) 
that the Finance Ministry has 
been trying to insert itself more into trade deliberations 
out of concern over Itamaraty\'s 
faltering support for the FTAA.  Chief of Staff Dirceu 
confirmed to Ambassador during 
their May 6 meeting that President Lula intends to convene a 
meeting with ministers prior 
to USTR Zoellick\'s arrival in order to arrive at a single GoB 
position regarding trade 
strategy. 
 
FTAA Policy Options 
-------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) As reported in reftel, Itamaraty interlocutors claim 
that proceeding with the 
FTAA status quo is untenable for Brazil, given the current 
impasse in WTO Doha 
Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, the absence of key 
Brazilian issues within the 
scope of FTAA negotiations, and public hostility toward the 
FTAA.  Specifically, they 
point to the unwillingness of the United States to negotiate 
new disciplines covering 
domestic support for agriculture and unfair trade remedies 
within the FTAA, and the U.S. 
market access offers for goods, which were least favorable 
for Mercosul, as limiting their 
political flexibility to move forward in negotiations. 
 
10. (SBU) Therefore, the GoB is considering and will likely 
propose to USTR Zoellick a 
new approach toward bilateral trade relations and/or 
reformulation of the FTAA 
negotiations.  Local press has identified the following 
policy options as under 
consideration: 
 
--negotiation of a U.S.-Mercosul (four-plus-one) agreement is 
the most often cited option. 
Antonio Simoes, Economic Adviser to Foreign Minister Amorim, 
has conveyed that 
USTR Zoellick should be prepared to discuss this possibility 
during his meeting with 
Amorim on May 28.  Itamaraty interlocutors stress that the 
four-plus-one would be 
narrow in scope, perhaps limited to tariff-only, and 
especially that it would be 
supplemental to FTAA negotiations, not in lieu of. 
--a reformulation of the FTAA to focus on tariffs, leaving 
contentious issues for 
negotiation within the WTO.  The GoB is concerned that 
certain investment and 
government procurement rules sought by the United States 
would limit Brazil\'s ability to 
pursue an economic development strategy utilizing industrial 
policies. 
 
--bifurcation of the FTAA process into two stages - the first 
stage of tariff-only 
negotiations to be completed by 2005 with subsequent 
launching of negotiations on the 
remaining issues.  NOTE: However, once tariff negotiations 
are complete, there would be 
no guarantee that Brazil would feel compelled to participate 
in negotiations in the areas it 
has identified as problematic. END NOTE. 
 
--seeking a delay in the end date of the FTAA negotiations 
until 2007.  Proponents argue 
that progress cannot be made in the FTAA until the thorny 
issues of domestic support and 
unfair trade remedies are dealt with in the DDA negotiations, 
which are unlikely to 
conclude by 2005. 
 
--the more remote possibility of a U.S.-Brazil supplemental 
negotiation.   We judge it 
unlikely that Brazil would pursue such an option at this 
time, particularly since Nestor 
Kirchner, Argentina\'s President-elect, reaffirmed Argentina\'s 
solidarity with Brazil\'s 
intention to strengthen Mercosul during his trip to Brasilia 
May 8. 
 
Implications 
--------------- 
 
11. (SBU) Itamaraty interlocutors have stressed that all 
options, even ones they are not 
promoting, involve continuation of FTAA negotiations. 
However, cynics warn that delay 
of the process or reformulation of the negotiations are only 
more subtle ways of 
deliberately undermining the FTAA and leading to its eventual 
demise. 
 
12. (C) If the United States does not agree to any alteration 
of FTAA substance or 
process, or to the pursuit of a \"supplemental\" U.S.-Mercosul 
agreement, post believes 
that a \"do nothing\" strategy by the USG would not precipitate 
an immediate withdrawal 
of Brazil from the FTAA.  However, it would likely lead to a 
hardening of Brazilian 
positions as it seeks to slow down the process and elicit 
support from other FTAA 
countries on contentious issues such as domestic support 
disciplines. 
 
13. (SBU) Complicating Brazil\'s FTAA analysis is its domestic 
political scene. 
Although Lula has widespread support to undertake thorny 
social security and tax reform, 
as the administration moves forward with its specific 
proposals, the debate is bound to 
become more polarized.  Five months into the administration, 
the government is also 
walking a fine line between kudos from the market on its 
stringent macroeconomic 
policies and the political backlash that may emerge due to 
the scarcity of resources for 
social spending that these policies yield.  On top of that, 
PT radicals, supported by some 
intellectuals and religious leaders, are pressing the 
government for a referendum on 
continuing with the FTAA.  The GoB would be politically hard 
pressed at this time to 
take on additional enemies in support of the currently 
envisioned FTAA. 
 
14. (C) According to Neto, the Pinheiro Guimaraes group is 
convinced that Brazil\'s 
negotiating position is stronger in a bilateral (4 1) than in 
a regional negotiation. 
Itamaraty believes that through a four-plus-one negotiation 
Brazil can more quickly attain 
market access for its key products (OJ, textiles, sugar, 
footwear, etc.), scoring economic 
and political success that would make continued participation 
in the FTAA palatable. 
Underlying this perception is the GoB\'s fear that the United 
States will not come forward 
in the FTAA with substantial, timely market access for key 
Brazilian products.  The 
policy options being considered by the GoB are designed to 
avoid a disastrous end-of-day 
scenario in which Brazil has negotiated issues of interest to 
the United States (investment, 
government procurement), and even though not getting what it 
needs in return, is 
compelled to sign the FTAA because diplomatically it cannot 
be left outside the 
hemispheric pact. 
 
Action Request 
------------------ 
 
15. (SBU) In pursuing a four-plus-one negotiation, the GoB 
may feel emboldened by 
U.S. negotiations with other countries in the region. 
However, it seems the GoB may 
underestimate the obstacles to providing Brazil with the 
market access concessions it 
seeks on sensitive products that would be inherent in such an 
agreement.  If the four-plus- 
one option is a non-starter from the USG perspective, post 
would appreciate guidance 
from Washington agencies concerning the need to subtly 
downplay it prior to USTR 
Zoellick\'s arrival.   When deliberating on possible USG 
reactions to GoB trade proposals, 
post also suggests that Washington consider potential market 
access carrots, such as 
movement on some key Brazilian products in the revised U.S. 
FTAA offer, to provide the 
GoB with something tangible, but that would keep 
deliberations squarely within the 
FTAA and premised on Brazilian movement in all other FTAA 
areas.  Additionally, any 
forward movement on \"discussing\" domestic support within the 
FTAA along the lines 
envisioned in instructions from the April 8-11 TNC meeting in 
Puebla could help 
establish for Brazilians U.S. sincerity in claiming that 
\"everything is on the table\" and 
assist in diffusing the most contentious issue for Brazil in 
the FTAA.

SUBJECT: IMF QUESTIONS NEED FOR NEW IMF PROGRAM IN 2004 
 
 
Classified By: Acting EconCouns David Edwards.  Reasons: 
1.5 B and D 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  Rogerio Zandamela, IMF Resident 
Representative in Brazil, told econoff that Anne Krueger, the 
IMF\'s Deputy Managing Director, is not interested in renewing 
the IMF stand-by arrangement when it expires at the end of 
the year.  Instead, she prefers to declare victory with the 
current successful program and wait in reserve in case needed 
again.  Zandamela added that he has his doubts about how a 
follow-on program would be structured.  He said the next key 
steps for restoring confidence are structural reform, and he 
believes that an IMF program with significant structural 
reform commitments would generate political opposition and be 
counter-productive.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) In a June 3 meeting with IMF Resident 
Representative Rogerio Zandamela, econoff asked whether 
Brazil\'s IMF program would be renewed when it expires at the 
end of the year.  (Note:  When an IMF mission visited Brazil 
in early May for the third review, a local paper carried a 
story that the GOB had already decided not to renew the 
program, which was quickly denied by the Ministry of Finance. 
 Later, when Anne Krueger, the IMF\'s First Deputy Managing 
Director, visited Brazil on May 19-20, she told the media 
that the question of renewing the agreement had not been 
discussed with the GOB.) 
 
3.  (C) Zandamela said the there had been internal IMF 
discussions about a follow-on program during the May 19-20 
visit.  Anoop Singh, Director of the IMF\'s Western Hemisphere 
Department, had accompanied Krueger and had been interested 
in exploring another IMF program.  However, according to 
Zandamela, Krueger\'s initial reaction was negative.  Krueger 
evidently said that the IMF should declare its current 
program a success and when it is over, step to the side and 
be available to help when and if necessary. 
 
4.  (C) Econoff asked if the GOB had the resources to repay 
its current IMF obligations without a new IMF agreement, and 
how the market would react if there were no IMF program. 
Zandamela said that gross reserves are high enough that 
Brazil could repay its obligations and still have a cushion, 
particularly if the GOB continues to issue bonds in the 
international market.  (Note:  Gross reserves were $43.3 
billion as of June 6, while net reserves (minus IMF funding) 
are approximately $17.0 billion.) 
 
5.  (C) Regarding the private sector reaction, Zandamela said 
that he is not concerned.  He continued that the key next 
step for the government is implementing its reform program 
(notably tax and pension reform, but also Central Bank 
autonomy and bankruptcy law reform).  Featuring structural 
reform in an IMF program would be difficult and maybe 
counter-productive, he said.  The administration cannot 
guarantee that congress will act on its reform proposals, and 
an IMF program conditioned on congressional action would 
probably generate political resistance in congress. 
(Typically, in Brazil\'s IMF programs, the administration 
commits to present legislation to congress but is silent on 
the question of approval.)  Therefore Zandamela has his 
doubts as to what a notional next IMF program should look 
like. 
 
6.  (C) Econoff asked whether the IMF would consider a 
monitoring program in the absence of a formal stand-by 
arrangement.  Zandamela said that he doubts the GOB would 
submit itself to a special review regime without the 
financial support of a regular program, given that the IMF 
missions are very time-consuming for the GOB.  He added, 
though, that even without an IMF program, the Fund would 
undertake twice-yearly reviews, compared to four times a year 
under a stand-by program. 
 
7.  (C) Zandamela cautioned that it is too soon to talk about 
a \"virtuous circle.\"  However, he added that by the end of 
the year the government\'s economic policies, combined with 
falling inflation, may open the way for a cycle of growing 
confidence, falling inflation, lower interest rates, 
accelerating economic growth, and reasonable capital inflows. 
 
8.  (C) Comment.  It\'s a bit early to make any judgment on 
whether Brazil should renew its IMF program at the end of the 
year, but Krueger\'s and Zandamela\'s comments provide a useful 
perspective on why a program may not be necessary.  In 
general, Zandamela is on target in his assessment that 
Brazil\'s economic success depends far more on GOB action 
rather than an IMF program.  However, we are less sanguine 
than Zandamela about market confidence in the absence of an 
IMF program, since a program would provide a buffer against 
balance of payment pressure as well as valuable benchmarks to 
measure the government\'s macroeconomic effort.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, BR 
SUBJECT:  Economic Growth Remains Sluggish 
 
 
1.  Summary.  The Brazilian economy is showing the sluggish 
effects of high real interest rates, which were raised in 
October, 2002 to contain growing inflationary pressure.  On a 
quarterly basis, GDP fell slightly in the first quarter of the 
year.  Annual results are somewhat better, growing 2.2%. 
Industrial production has been particularly weak, particularly in 
sectors that rely on domestic demand.  End summary. 
 
2.  The Brazilian economy, to use a local term, \"walked sideways\" 
in the first quarter of the year.  Depending on the measure the 
economy either declined slightly or is growing modestly.  One 
thing is certain, though, and that is that economic growth is 
weak.  This is largely due to the high interest rates, which 
where increased by 8.5 percentage points since October to fight 
inflation, reaching 26.5% in February, thus weakening economic 
production.  On June 18, the Central Bank lowered the benchmark 
interest rate (SELIC) to 26%. 
 
3.  Part of the debate on the impact these high nominal interest 
rates have on the economy depends on just how high they are in 
real terms.  Deflating the basic interest rate levels (SELIC) by 
past inflation (IPCA), real interest rates ranged between 8-10% 
in 2002 and the first quarter of 2003, as higher nominal interest 
rates were offset by increasing inflation.  However, forward- 
looking inflation expectations have tumbled in recent months.  As 
a result, forward-looking real interest rates climbed up to 15%. 
 
4.  The GDP results, released by the Brazilian Institute of 
Statistics and Geography (IBGE), showed that the economy grew 
2.2% for the 12-month period ending in March.  This represents a 
steady improvement for the 12-month growth rate, which was 1.5% 
at the end of 2002, 0.5% as of September, 2002, and flat (0%) at 
the end of the first half of 2002.  (Note that production was 
weak in the last half of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 
because of the 2001 energy crisis.  Given this low point of 
comparison, the 2.2% growth through March suggests that the 
economy remains sluggish.) 
 
5.  The concerns about a sluggish economy are reaffirmed by the 
quarterly data, which show that the economy declined by 0.1% in 
the first quarter of 2003, compared to the last quarter of 2002. 
Analysts suggest that this downturn is an indication that the 
modest uptick in growth that took place in the last quarter of 
2002 has been suppressed by a tight monetary policy. 
 
6.  The good story lies in agriculture, which has pulled the rest 
of the economy along.  On an annual basis, all sectors showed 
some growth, led by a strong agricultural sector:  agriculture, 
6.6%; industry, 3.2%; and services, 1.3%.  On a quarterly basis, 
however, industry, which accounts for about 37% of the Brazilian 
GDP, fell by 2.2%, while agriculture rose 3.7% and services 
stalled. 
 
GDP by Sector 
March 2003 
 
-                First quarter 2003       Annual 
-               (seasonally adjusted) 
GDP                   -0.1                 2.2 
- Agriculture          3.7                 6.6 
- Industry            -2.2                 3.2 
- Services            -0.1                 1.3 
 
7.  The poor performance by the industrial sector is troubling, 
since it has historically been an effective proxy for growth 
trends.  (Industry accounts for a larger share of the economy 
than does agriculture, while the services sector, which is even 
larger, is relatively stable.)  The industrial sector displayed 
its vulnerability to the interest rate increase imposed since the 
last quarter of 2002.  Investment has dropped due to credit 
restraints (credit to industry fell 5% from Oct02-Apr03) and 
consumer demand has fallen as well since real income has been 
depressed by rising inflation (13% in the same period).  On the 
plus side, the Brazilian Institute of Industrial Development 
(IEDI) points out that the industrial sector has benefited from 
the excellent results of exports and a temporary recovery of 
durable goods consumption prior to February 2003 (when the 
Central Bank again increased interest rates by a percentage 
point). 
 
8.  IBGE releases industrial production data on a monthly basis. 
Looking at industrial subsectors, intermediate goods had the most 
favorable results, mainly due to the growing petroleum output and 
the outstanding export performance of the pulp and paper sector. 
Intermediate goods production increased 2.7% in the first four 
months of 2002, compared to the same period in 2002.  Capital 
goods performed reasonably well, in part because of investment by 
exporting firms that are facing capacity constraints and because 
companies are switching to locally produced goods as part of an 
import substitution process which was triggered by exchange rate 
depreciation.  But even so, according to IBGE figures, capital 
goods output fell 1.5% in the first four months of the year. 
Subsectors which depend heavily on the internal market (and 
therefore on favorable credit conditions), such as durable goods 
(e.g. automobiles and home appliances) and non-durables 
(clothing, food, pharmaceuticals), fell 4.6% and 5.3%, 
respectively. 
 
LOOKING AT THE DEMAND SIDE 
-------------------------- 
 
9.  The demand side of GDP confirms the poor domestic 
performance.  Family consumption and investment both fell on 
annual basis, (-0.9% and 2.0%, respectively), as well as on a 
quarterly basis (-0.6% and 4.6%, respectively).  Roberto Olinto, 
, 
the Head of the National Accounts Department of IBGE, attributes 
the low consumption performance to falling real wage, low credit 
availability and high banking spreads.  Family consumption bears 
the highest weight in the growth calculation, equal to about 60%. 
 
10.  Growth was driven by trade, with exports of goods and 
services rising 12.9% on an annual basis, and imports decreasing 
9.5%.   Government consumption increased modestly, 0.5%.  Export 
success stories include high value added manufactures such as jet 
planes and also mineral and agriculture products such as iron ore 
and soybeans, all benefiting from a favorable exchange rate. 
 
GDP, Demand components 
March 2003 
 
-           First Quarter 2003    Annual 
-          seasonally adjusted 
GDP                 -0.1          2.2 
Family Consumption  -0.6         -0.9 
Government           0.5          0.5 
Investment          -4.6         -2.0 
Exports             -1.3         12.9 
Imports              4.5         -9.5 
 
ANOTHER INDICATOR: UNEMPLOYMENT RATES 
------------------------------------- 
 
11.  The current reduction of economic activity also reflects on 
unemployment rates.  At the same time that internal consumption 
and investment fall, the number of lay-offs tend to increase. 
According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics 
(IBGE), the unemployment rate for the six main metropolitan areas 
increased to 12.1% in March, from 11.6% in February.  The number 
of informal employees increased by over 9% for the last 12 months 
prior to March, while the number of formal employees increased 
only by 3.3%.  The National Confederation of Industry (CNI) also 
shows a 7.7% decrease in real industrial payroll on a twelve- 
month basis. 
 
EXPECTATIONS 
------------ 
 
12.  Given the recent signals that a sluggish economy is slowing 
even more, some analysts have revised downwards their estimates 
for the 2003 economic growth.  In the Central Bank survey of 
market analysts, the average growth forecast is 1.8% for 2003 
(four weeks ago, the average forecast had been 1.9%).  The 
official Economic Research official agency (IPEA) dropped its 
forecast to 1.6%, from 1.8%.  The recent Central Bank decision to 
lower the SELIC rate 50 basis points, to 26%, probably will not 
provide much relief this year, since the market was already 
anticipating lower rates, real rates remain high given falling 
inflation expectations, and there is a six-month lag before 
changes in monetary policy have an impact on production.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S ARSLANIAN: FTAA COMPROMISE POSSIBLE 
 
Classified By: Janice Fair, Economic Officer for Reason Section 1.5 (b) 
 and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  In an informal discussion with econoff on 
July 13, Regis Arslanian, the GOB\'s new director of FTAA and 
Mercosul-EU negotiations, acknowledged that Mercosul was 
disappointed with the reaction it received during the San 
Salvador TNC meeting to its proposal for restructuring the 
FTAA negotiations and suggested that Brazil could accept a 
compromise reformulation with the United States.  According 
to Arslanian, a bilateral structure for market access 
discussions is a key element for the GOB.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On July 13, while traveling back to Brasilia from the 
FTAA Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) meeting in San 
Salvador (July 8-11), econoff discussed Mercosul\'s take on 
the meeting with Regis Percy Arslanian.  Arslanian has been 
advisor to Itamaraty Secretary-General Pinheiro Guimaraes, 
but told Econoff that he has been chosen to replace 
Ambassador Carlos Simas Magalhaesas as Head of the 
International Negotiations Department (FTAA and Mercosul-EU 
negotiations) under Ambassador Luiz Filipe Macedo Soares, who 
is Under Secretary for South America and Brazil\'s lead FTAA 
negotiator at the Vice-Minister level.  Earlier, econoff was 
told by Tovar da Silva Nunes, the GOB\'s FTAA Coordinator, 
that Simas had been sacked on July 4 for not being in-sync 
with Itamaraty FTAA policy directives. 
 
3. (C) According to Arslanian, Mercosul was extremely 
disappointed by the reaction it received at the TNC meeting 
to its three-track proposal for restructuring the FTAA. 
Roughly speaking, the three tracks refer to: Track 1- 
bilateral market access negotiations (industrial and 
agricultural goods, services, and investment) carried out 
under the FTAA umbrella; Track 2- minimal rules to support 
market access such as dispute settlement, rules of origin, 
civil society, institutional issues, Hemispheric Cooperation 
Program, etc.; and Track 3 - rules for services and 
investment, intellectual property, competition policy, market 
access and rules for government procurement, domestic 
support, and trade remedies, all of which would be considered 
only in the WTO. 
 
4. (C) Mercosul presented its proposal in the TNC plenary, 
but the bulk of discussion took place in an informal session 
during which most countries expressed concern with, and to a 
certain extent criticism of, Mercosul\'s intention to reduce 
the scope of the FTAA.  Arslanian said that the United States 
and other countries did not fully appreciate the intense 
domestic political and social pressure the GOB is under, and 
reiterated that it would be impossible for Brazil/Mercosul to 
complete the FTAA negotiations as currently structured. 
 
5. (C) While other countries have suggested that a 
comprehensive FTAA in both market access and rules is 
necessary to foster economic integration and prosperity in 
the region by encouraging strategic hemispheric partnerships 
and attracting foreign direct investment, Brazil sees its 
strategic needs differently.  Arslanian emphasized two 
points:  the importance of the U.S. market for Brazilian 
goods; and the importance of bilateral market access 
negotiations as envisioned in Mercosul\'s three-track 
proposal. 
 
6.  (C) Arslanian stressed the GOB\'s interest in negotiating 
access to the U.S. market within the FTAA.  However, he 
registered disbelief that the U.S. is serious about giving 
duty-free treatment to certain sensitive products, citing 
orange juice and steel, in particular.  Econoff rebutted that 
in the initial U.S. goods offer every tariff item was within 
one of the four product baskets, each of which is slated to 
go to zero-duty at some time, but pointed out that with 
Mercosul\'s proposed wholesale removal of a number of issues 
of interest to the United States from the FTAA, the U.S. 
would undoubtedly have difficulty justifying such a 
comprehensive market opening.  In response, Arslanian said 
Mercosul would be willing to negotiate market access in 
financial services and telecommunications with the United 
States as trade-offs.  Pressed on whether Mercosul would 
really be offering anything new in these areas, he answered 
emphatically in the affirmative. 
 
7. (C) In explaining Brazil\'s rationale for seeking a 
bilateral negotiating structure, Arslanian said that Brazil 
believes other countries in the region (Central Americans, 
etc.) are willing to give away much more than Brazil is in 
market access for services and investment to gain an opening 
of the U.S. goods market.   He reiterated several times that 
Brazil will not \"level\" its interests to those of other 
countries and would not accept a structure that would force 
Brazil to make concessions based on other countries\' 
willingness to \"give away the store.\"  Echoing comments made 
by Mercosul\'s Uruguayan lead during the TNC, Arslanian also 
said that a bilateral process could focus the negotiation 
more specifically on the interests of the parties involved 
and make it easier to identify for political leaders and 
society at large the trade-offs that are made to reach an 
agreement.  He claimed that Mercosul will not submit any 
offers in services, investment and government procurement 
until a bilateral negotiating structure is approved. 
 
8. (C) Arslanian asked why the U.S. delegation to the TNC did 
not discuss a baseline agreement approach that he believed 
the USG had contemplated.  Econoff responded simply that the 
USG did not have an official proposal to put forward. 
Arslanian bemoaned the lack of such a discussion, opining 
that between the three-track proposal and a baseline 
agreement approach, a compromise could probably be reached, 
as long as it includes a bilateral market access structure. 
He intimidated that Mercosul could agree to include 
government procurement market access under the FTAA and that 
the negotiating forum for rules in services and investment, 
and IPR could be revisited.  Arslanian also wondered aloud 
about the possibility of a two-stage process, with deepening 
(read as rules) coming in stage two, but was silent when 
asked by econoff what guarantee the U.S. would have that 
Brazil would undertake stage two negotiations if it obtained 
the market access for goods that it wanted in stage one. 
 
9. (C) Comment:  Arslanian seemed eager to encourage a dialog 
with the United States to develop a vision for the FTAA that 
would satisfy both countries\' needs.  Given his past position 
in the Itamaraty Secretary-General\'s Office and his new 
position specifically overseeing the FTAA negotiations, we 
are inclined to view his statements on GOB priorities and 
possible flexibilities as credible.  See septel for Mission\'s 
overview and analysis of factors affecting the GOB\'s latest 
formulation of its FTAA policy.  End Comment.

TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) 
SUBJECT: WHAT\'S BEHIND BRAZIL\'S FTAA POLICY 
 
 
Classified By: Janice Fair, Economic Officer for Reason Section 1.5 (b) 
 and (d) 
 
1. (U) The description that follows of the political and 
economic factors helping to shape Brazil\'s trade policy, and 
specifically its approach to the FTAA negotiations, is 
offered to assist U.S. policymakers in determining whether 
and how enough common ground can be found to conclude the 
FTAA process successfully. 
 
2. (C) Summary and introduction.  A number of concurrent 
forces are moving Brazil along its present FTAA trajectory. 
These forces, or considerations for formulating policy, are 
sometimes contradictory and may have led to some GOB 
miscalculation on how best to achieve Brazil\'s interests 
within the FTAA as well as the degree of hemispheric support 
it would receive for its ideas to restructure the 
negotiations.   Brazil\'s political goals, which include a 
leadership role in South America along with a strong focus on 
development and the social agenda, sometimes clash in its 
pursuit of certain national economic interests.  However, the 
GOB\'s vision of a reformulated FTAA is solidly rooted in its 
perception of national interest and of the outcome required 
for Brazil to benefit from the FTAA.  The newly-elaborated 
three-track approach is not simply a negotiating ploy. 
Brazil\'s FTAA calculation has always differed from that of 
other countries in the hemisphere.  For Brazil, the bottom 
line is improved access to the U.S. market for its 
agricultural and industrial goods, not regional rules for 
attracting foreign direct investment. 
 
3. (C) Despite Brazil\'s strong desire to secure improved 
access to the U.S. market, the rigid perspective of Itamaraty 
officials in charge of FTAA policy inclines us to take at 
face value the GOB claim that it will not continue with the 
across the board FTAA negotiations as originally envisioned 
and currently structured.  We also suspect that the GOB is 
currently in a vulnerable stage in its FTAA policy, given the 
substantial general rebuff of the Mercosul three-track 
proposal that occurred during the Trade Negotiating Committee 
(TNC) meeting in San Salvador July 8-11. 
 
4. (C) Regis Arslanian, unofficially Itamaraty\'s new policy 
director for the FTAA and Mercosul-EU negotiations, has 
suggested privately that a compromise would be possible 
between Mercosul\'s three-track proposal and a baseline 
agreement that he understood the USG to have contemplated 
(septel).  According to Arslanian, a bilateral structure for 
all market access negotiations is the key element for Brazil. 
 End Summary. 
 
5. (C) As the GOB evaluates potential benefits of an FTAA, 
assesses the current status of negotiations, and develops 
proposals to move the negotiations more in line with its 
perceived interests, we believe the following chief factors 
impact its deliberations: 
 
* Brazil\'s desire to be a regional political leader and, in 
particular, to be the driving force behind Mercosul\'s 
reinvigoration. 
 
* The belief that some Brazilian producers are not 
sufficiently competitive to benefit from and in fact could 
lose through a free trade agreement at this time. 
 
* The recognition that Brazil needs substantial expansion of 
exports to attain the economic growth necessary to address 
its social agenda. 
 
*The belief that exports to the United States will continue 
to grow anyway. 
 
* The concern that rules within comprehensive trade 
agreements may constrain the GOB\'s ability to design its own 
preferred economic development policies. 
 
* The difficulty in convincing the public and Congress that 
an FTAA agreement would be a net positive for Brazil. 
 
* The existence of divisions and opposition within society 
and government alike on the direction of Brazil\'s FTAA policy. 
 
LEADER OF SOUTH AMERICAN INTEGRATION 
 
6. (C) The dominant theme in President Lula\'s foreign policy 
has been Brazil\'s role as the natural leader of South 
American integration, with Mercosul as the cornerstone.  Lula 
has met almost every South American counterpart at least once 
in the six months since taking office.  Press reports that 
follow such meetings are replete with declarations of 
solidarity, including references to the need to forge common 
positions within the FTAA and WTO against developed country 
protectionism.  Brazil has used the granting of BNDES credit 
lines to Argentina, Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia and Peru to 
reinforce these regional ties and fidelity to Brazil. 
However, the GOB may have taken the rhetoric too seriously, 
confusing no-cost statements of support in public 
declarations with substantive positions within negotiations. 
Despite Brazil\'s efforts to forge closer alliances with 
countries in the region, it appears that Mercosul\'s 
(Brazil\'s) proposal to reformulate the FTAA was roundly 
rebuffed in the San Salvador TNC meeting. 
 
7. (C) President Kirchner\'s election in Argentina has 
apparently provided Brazil with a like-minded partner to make 
Mercosul a priority.  However, Mercosul remains more 
important as a political project than an economic one, and at 
times Brazil\'s political interests regarding Mercosul appear 
to blind it to its own economic interests.  Virtually all 
Brazilians now recognize that the Mercosul market is 
insufficient to provide the export growth Brazil needs. 
 
BRAZIL COST - LACK OF COMPETITIVENESS 
 
8. (C) Rather than drawing attention to the new opportunities 
that a hemisphere-wide trade agreement could present, the 
FTAA generates fear in Brazil: the widespread perception that 
many Brazilian industries cannot compete effectively, at 
least not yet.  Although developed country protectionism is 
always cited as a major problem undermining Brazil\'s 
competitiveness, so are internal problems sometimes called 
the \"Brazil cost,\"  i.e., high costs associated with Brazil\'s 
tax structure, outdated social security system, labor code, 
poor education, and, in general, bureaucratic obstacles to 
commerce.  While the GOB is committed to social security and 
tax reform, it seems to lack faith it can lower the \"Brazil 
cost\" sufficiently in the near term to guarantee Brazilian 
competitiveness in the free trade environment an FTAA 
agreement would create. 
 
EXPORTS ARE ESSENTIAL 
 
9. (C) The GOB sees export growth as essential for economic 
growth and job creation.  The GOB is still following tight 
fiscal and monetary policies designed to control the 
inflation that started to accelerate following last year\'s 30 
percent devaluation of the Real.  Foreign direct investment 
has fallen off and capital in-flows have not recouped 
following last year\'s financial uncertainties.  Exports grew 
at a record pace at the beginning of this year, but are 
expected to taper off somewhat with a strengthened currency. 
Although the FTAA is a trade negotiation among 34 countries, 
the GOB has stated clearly that its primary interest is 
access to the U.S. market for goods.  Thus there is a strong 
incentive for Brazil-led Mercosul to stick with the FTAA if 
it is clear that achieving a trade agreement with the United 
States outside the FTAA is highly unlikely. 
 
EXPORTS HAVE BEEN GROWING 
 
10. (C) Although seeking improved access to the U.S. market 
is a high GOB priority, some Brazilians note that exports to 
the United States continue to grow anyway, even without a 
trade agreement.  The United States is Brazil\'s largest 
export market, and officials cite growth in exports to the 
United States in each of the last seven years as evidence of 
a trend.  Although the GOB wants to negotiate increased 
access to the U.S. market through the FTAA, it is unlikely 
that Brazil would choose to do so at any cost. 
 
FREEDOM TO PURSUE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES 
 
11. (C)  While aggressively seeking increased access to 
foreign markets to allow for economic development through 
export growth, the GOB is hesitant to enter into 
comprehensive trade negotiations -- for example, those that 
include rules on services, investment and government 
procurement -- due to fear that these might constrain its 
ability to develop new economic development policies.  Such 
thinking was reflected in the GOB proposals in late 2002 to 
changes the WTO TRIMS agreement to, among others, allow 
performance requirements for investors, and again in 
Brazil/Mercosul\'s FTAA goods market access offer that 
included provisions to protect infant industries.  Although 
not wishing to go all the way back to the inward-looking 
policies of the sixties, the GOB does appear more concerned 
about maintaining its freedom of action than about 
establishing better hemispheric-wide rules for economic 
activity. 
 
FTAA A HARD SELL 
 
12. (C) Hand-wringing about the FTAA is a daily staple in the 
Brazilian press, creating a constant sense of pressure and 
urgency.  There isn\'t a single day when articles speculating 
about FTAA policy do not appear in the major Brazilian 
dailies, and reporting in smaller newspapers and magazines on 
the subject is also prolific.  Past rhetoric by Lula and his 
PT party helped create this hostile climate, and the GOB has 
increased public doubt and confusion through its own 
often-conflicting statements.  The result has limited the 
GOB\'s maneuverability and intensified the leadership 
challenge it faces in winning domestic approval for any 
agreement. 
 
13. (C) Opposition to the FTAA is not new in Brazil. 
Although industries worry about the \"Brazil cost\" and their 
own specific competitive aspects, and labor organizations are 
fearful about employment repercussions and loss of union 
leadership, the arguments of the most vocal opponents are 
usually ideological.  The emphasis that Lula and Itamaraty 
have given under the Lula administration to communication 
with civil society, both domestically and through FTAA 
hemisphere-wide fora, underscores the GOB\'s real concern 
about garnering public support for the FTAA. 
 
14. (C) We believe that concern about deep-seated domestic 
opposition to an FTAA deal is behind Mercosul\'s recent 
proposal to allow participation of private sector and 
legislative representatives in its official FTAA delegations. 
 In contrast to other countries\' concerns about 
confidentiality and the inflexibility that an expanded 
 
SIPDIS 
delegation composition might introduce into the negotiations, 
Brazil apparently sees direct participation by these groups 
as a means of gaining their approval for any eventual 
agreement. The GOB may also be pushing for a bilateral 
structure for market access because it would be simpler to 
explain the trade-offs that were made to reach agreement. 
Similarly, for Itamaraty a \"positive list\"  approach for 
services and investment market access makes it easier to 
convey details on concessions to labor leaders and other 
social and political leaders. 
 
NOT EVERYONE AGREES WITH ITAMARATY POLICY 
 
15. (C) There has been a recent consolidation of power within 
Itamaraty, first with the replacement of Ambassador Hugueney 
and now with the replacement of Ambassador Simas, of a group 
that has viewed the FTAA skeptically for years.  By all 
accounts, the driving force behind current Itamaraty policy 
is the Secretary-General, Pinheiro Guimaraes.  He has been 
among the Brazilian observers who have for years portrayed an 
FTAA deal as at worst as a project of the United States to 
take over the Brazilian economy and at best as a necessary 
evil. 
 
16. (C)  However, not everyone within the diplomatic corps 
nor within the government agrees with Itamaraty\'s current 
FTAA policy.  Within other ministries, including the 
ministries of Agriculture, Development and Finance, there is 
concern that Itamaraty\'s minimalist approach does not take 
proper account of the potential economic benefits to be 
gained through the FTAA.  Nonetheless, Itamaraty has been put 
in charge of coordinating FTAA policymaking, and we do not 
believe efforts to exploit differences among ministers would 
be successful.  Attempts to stir the pot in this way would 
likely only stiffen hardliners and undermine like-minded 
ministers. 
 
COMMENT 
 
17.  (C) As the GOB reflects on its next step(s) given the 
lack of support for Mercosul\'s three-track proposal, we 
believe it will see its scope for movement as very limited. 
After so publicly arguing for this approach, the GOB will 
have a hard time abandoning it.  Some in the GOB may harbor a 
sense of being misled, since they took Ambassador Zoellick\'s 
presentations in Brasilia in May as an invitation to engage 
in a dialog about reformulation of the FTAA.  Arslanian, for 
example, said the Brazilian delegation in El Salvador was 
disappointed that the U.S. side made no mention there of a 
\"baseline\" approach. 
 
18. (C) There are intense political and social pressures for 
Brazil to step back from the broad-based FTAA negotiations as 
currently configured.  Should the GOB fail to obtain 
structural changes in the negotiations, Brazil is likely to 
simply go through the motions with the FTAA, refraining from 
constructive participation.  Eventually it might even feel 
compelled to suspend participation in the negotiations, 
reluctant as it might be as a regional leader to be seen as 
the villain who killed the golden egg. 
 
19.  (C) The present moment could be an opportune time should 
the USG decide to explore potential modifications to the FTAA 
negotiations that would give Brazil some of the political 
backing it is seeking.  As noted above, Regis Arslanian 
seemed to suggest to econoff that Mercosul could be flexible 
on a number of areas important to the United States -- 
services and investment rules, IPR and government procurement 
within the FTAA -- as long as market access could be 
negotiated bilaterally.  In future discussions the USG may 
have with the GOB on this issue, we would of course be 
leaving Brazil in no doubt that it, not the USG, is the 
demandeur for change in FTAA scope.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL: NO PUBLIC SIGN OF RETREAT FROM FTAA 
PROPOSAL 
 
REF: BRASILIA 2231 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  Following the FTAA Trade Negotiating 
Committee meeting in San Salvador July 8-11, during which 
Mercosul unveiled Brazil\'s 3-track proposal for restructuring 
negotiations to unenthusiastic Vice-Ministers, public debate 
in Brazil over the FTAA has been unusually quiet.  Itamaraty 
officials have generally declined comment.  In responding to 
questions after the swearing-in ceremony of Ambassador Luiz 
Macedo Soares as Under Secretary for South America on July 
21, Foreign Minister Amorim stated that the GOB\'s intention 
is to continue pushing the proposal, but signaled a possible 
opening for compromise on the specifics.  Comments by Amorim 
on the same occasion regarding the desirability of more 
commitment to the pursuit of current GOB policies among, at 
least, the top diplomatic echelon of the Ministry, prompted a 
public rebuke by former Foreign Minister Lafer.  End Summary. 
 
BACKGROUND - THE PUBLIC UNVEILING 
 
2. (SBU) On the eve of the FTAA Trade Negotiating Committee 
(TNC) meeting in San Salvador July 8-11, Foreign Minister 
Amorim wrote an op-ed in which he publicly unveiled Brazil\'s 
Mercosul proposal to transform the FTAA by establishing three 
paths or \"tracks\" for considering various elements of the 
current negotiation, including moving some elements to the 
WTO (see reftel).  Amorim argued that a new approach was 
needed because within the FTAA, Brazil was \"encountering a 
negotiating context that is complex from the standpoint of 
Brazilian interests,\"  and that the FTAA project as currently 
envisioned goes far beyond the meaning of \"free trade\" in its 
strict sense since it includes rules for services, 
investment, government procurement, and intellectual property 
rights, which have a \"direct effect on the regulatory powers 
of the countries concerned.\"  He depicted the proposal as one 
that would create an \"FTAA that is possible\"  by balancing 
Brazil\'s (offensive) interests with compromises on its 
ability to design and execute policies for social, 
environmental, technological and other types of development. 
 
STANDING FIRM 
 
3. (SBU)  Following the less than enthusiastic response the 
proposal received from Vice-Ministers attending the TNC 
meeting, public discussion in Brazil of the FTAA and the 
proposal has been unusually quiet.  One press source claimed 
that he was trying to write an article about the FTAA 
proposal, but was unable to find Itamaraty officials willing 
to be interviewed.  However, answering questions after the 
swearing-in ceremony of Ambassador Luiz Macedo Soares as 
Under Secretary for South America (and FTAA lead negotiator) 
on July 21, Minister Amorim stated that the GOB\'s intention 
is to continue pushing the 3-track proposal.  Amorim said the 
GOB\'s position had not changed \"by so much as a dot.\"  He 
went on to claim that the current format of the negotiations 
among the 34 FTAA countries \"does not suit the United States 
just as it does not suit us.\"   The article reported that 
according to a government source, the U.S. negotiators at the 
TNC meeting had maintained complete silence, which prompted 
Amorim to comment that \"silence gives consent.\" 
 
COMPROMISE ON THE DETAILS? 
 
4.  (SBU) Amorim sought to distance himself somewhat from the 
specifics of the proposal by stating that he does not plan to 
involve himself in a debate over \"formalities.\"  According to 
press reports, he said that Brazil might even accept 
\"agreements on investments and other systemic topics (in the 
FTAA path) provided they do not go beyond the WTO\'s current 
guidelines.\"  Amorim also again stated a preference for a 
focus within the FTAA on a market access agreement between 
the United States and Mercosul. 
 
5.  (SBU) In late June, the Lula administration came under 
sharp criticism from anti-FTAA forces for supposedly 
providing unwarranted impetus to the negotiations by 
re-committing to their conclusion by January 2005 as part of 
the U.S.-Brazil presidential summit.  Now, Itamaraty is 
facing criticism from the opposite direction.  Press has 
suggested that some ministries fear Itamaraty may have 
imparted a \"less palatable\" tone to the proposal during the 
TNC meeting, leading to a lack of support.  According to 
press reports, the National Confederation of Industries 
(CNI), which advises the GOB on trade policy through 
coordination of the Brazilian Business Coalition, also has 
noted concern that the current 3-track proposal is 
considerably less ambitious for achieving integration than 
the present FTAA scope.  However, this concern is coupled 
with an acknowledgment by CNI that different economic and 
political circumstances in Brazil warrant some change to the 
FTAA. 
 
6.  (SBU) Note.  In describing the tit-for-tat approach of 
\"moving\" elements for negotiation from the FTAA to the WTO, 
Brazilian officials, industry representatives and press 
continue to erroneously characterize USG and GOB motives as 
each taking \"sensitive\" issues to the WTO.  No 
differentiation is made between the \"sensitive\" nature of 
investment or intellectual property rights for Brazil, and 
the structural difficulty of negotiating domestic support in 
a regional forum because of domestic agricultural support 
programs being global versus country specific, with two of 
the three major users of such programs (EU and Japan) not 
located within the hemisphere.   End Note. 
 
IDEOLOGICAL LITMUS TEST 
 
7.  (SBU) Minister Amorim stirred up a separate debate this 
week when he, as one journalist characterized, \"broke with 
the maxim that a diplomat is an official of the State, and 
therefore, will be above the ideological directives of the 
(Presidential) Planalto Palace and everyday political games.\" 
 As part of his official address during Macedo Soares 
swearing-in, Amorim said that in making appointments, two 
things should be considered: professional competence and the 
person\'s \"natural affinity with the orientation of the 
Government, the President of the Republic, and the Minister.\" 
 He went on to say that the professional (diplomatic) corps 
ought to be \"enthusiastically engaged\" with certain political 
lines and \"orientations\" and claimed that Macedo Soares 
fulfilled these requirements.  His comments drew a swift 
rebuke from former Foreign Minister Lafer in the form of an 
op-ed in which Lafer insisted that a diplomat\'s duty is 
simply to serve Brazil.

SUBJECT:  PENSION REFORM: GOB VEERS, TACKS, TAKES ON WATER 
 
Refs: A) Brasilia 1466, B) Brasilia 80 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (U) Lula\'s crucial pension-reform bill was approved by the 
Chamber of Deputies special committee on July 23 -- but only 
after undergoing political buffets and a perhaps fateful 
overhaul.  In a fundamental about-face, the GoB has accepted 
that all current public-sector employees will remain eligible 
for pensions equal to their top salary (albeit with big 
improvements in minimum-age and time-worked eligibility 
criteria.)  Chief factor behind this concession was shameless 
lobbying by Brazil\'s judiciary, which enjoys unique pension 
benefits and will ultimately decide any reform\'s 
constitutionality.  There was also pressure from the GoB\'s 
base in Congress with its long ties to public-sector unions. 
 
2. (U) Fiscally, the GoB claims the overall impact of its 
shift is negligible.  Federal savings over the next twenty 
years will still total 50.7 billion, vs. 52.4 billion under 
the GoB\'s original proposals, supposedly.  `The market\' seems 
to take these numbers at face value, and has been placid. 
Politically, however, these early pension-bill concessions 
have seemed to pose doubts over the goals and resolve of 
Lula\'s team.  They may have opened the door to a snowball of 
public clamor, brinkmanship, and further changes that will 
gut the reform.  Lula\'s tax-reform bill, due for a committee 
vote soon, could get trapped in a similar cycle.  He and his 
team undoubtedly sense the danger and now are drumming the 
message that they have gone to the limit of their pension- 
reform horse-trading.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A Fortnight\'s Commotion in Review 
--------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) The GoB\'s about-face began on July 9, following 
drawn-out dialogue with new Supreme Court Chief Justice 
Correa.  The latter evidently sees his job as embracing the 
duty to lobby for retention of the judiciary\'s uniquely 
generous pension privileges, of which \"integral\" (100% of 
final salary) pensions are the capstone.  The GoB in turn has 
to bear in mind that the Supreme Court can torpedo any 
pension reform by ruling it unconstitutional, as happened 
with Cardoso\'s 1998 proposal to tax pensions.  Correa, Social- 
Security Minister Berzoini, and lower-House Speaker Cunha, 
with Planalto\'s Dirceu in the wings, conferred secretively 
for two weeks.  Outcome:  while Lula was in Europe, on July 
10 local press headlined the administration\'s alleged 
surrender on the principle of \"integral\" pensions, not just 
for the judiciary but for the whole current public sector. 
Whether future public-sector workers, too, would get integral 
pensions was not made explicit. 
 
4. (U) The news triggered consternation from media, Brazil\'s 
governors, and Finance Minister Palocci.  Former Social- 
Security Minister Brant, who now heads the Chamber of 
Deputies\' special committee on the subject, was widely quoted 
as saying \"the new reform is no reform.\"  Various PT 
politicians in and out of Congress lamented having stuck 
their necks out defending the GoB\'s original reform plan. 
Palocci by all accounts had not been kept current on the 
Cunha/Berzoini/Correa/Dirceu talks and wanted to cancel his 
European trip to join Lula, in favor of staying home to fight 
for the GoB\'s original reform guidelines. 
 
5. (U) But the weightiest adverse reaction was from Brazil\'s 
governors.  Fiscal pressure on their own state budgets from 
the pension system is as acute as on the Union\'s; many can 
afford to pay \"integral\" pensions even less.  Lula made a 
point of forming and presenting his pension and tax reform 
plans to Congress with the governors\' consensus in April. 
That the GoB now appeared to have negotiated so great a 
change in the pension-reform plan, leaving governors to learn 
about it in the papers, sat very badly.  Key Minas Gerais and 
Sao Paulo governors Neves and Alckmin voiced opposition in 
careful but ominous tones.  Temporizing, Dirceu convened a 
meeting July 16 with five representative governors, plus 
Cunha and Berzoini.  At that meeting, Berzoini gave figures 
purporting that the changes overall would be revenue-neutral 
for states as well as the Federal Treasury.  Governors seem 
to have warily gone along, but with the insistence that 
future public workers be ineligible for \"integral\" pensions. 
 
Lula Decides 
------------ 
6. (U) Meanwhile, from Portugal, Lula asserted his authority 
to arbitrate.  At the tense inter-ministerial meeting which 
followed his return on Thursday July 17, according to an 
account in last week\'s \"Epoca\" financial weekly, Lula 
censured Berzoini and Cunha (but absolved Dirceu) for undue 
\"precipitousness\" in their political negotiations.  Yet at 
meeting\'s end, despite Palocci\'s and Communications advisor 
Gushiken\'s arguments against, Lula gave his imprimatur to 
Berzoini\'s advocacy of integral pensions.  Lula also endorsed 
the continuation of \"parity,\" i.e., that retirees\' pensions 
increase by the same factor as current workers\' salaries. 
However, he ruled out letting future public-sector workers be 
eligible for integral pensions, and he reasserted the GoB\'s 
tough original guidelines in some other key respects. 
 
7. (U) The next day, the bill\'s sponsor, Deputy Carlos 
Pimental (PT-Ceara) presented its adjusted version.  Salient 
features include the following. 
 
-- minimum conditions for integral pensions: (women) 55 years 
old with 30 years of INSS contributions and 20 years in the 
public sector, including 10 in present occupation (\"cargo\"); 
(men) 60/35/20/10 years, respectively. 
 
-- for future public-sector employees, a monthly pension cap 
of BRL 2,400, with the option of a complementary pension fund 
contributed to by government (same as the initial GoB 
proposal). 
 
-- pensions to be taxed at 11%, starting at the present 
personal-income tax floor of 1,058 Reals/month.  The earlier 
agreement had been for a floor of 2,400/month. 
 
-- salary and hence pension sub-ceilings for state and 
municipal judiciary employees of 75% the salaries of Supreme 
Court judges.  The Berzoini/Cunha agreement had been 90.25%. 
 
-- survivor\'s benefit (currently 100% of the pension without 
limit) to remain 100% only up to 1,058 Reals/month, with a 
30% discount on anything above that level. 
 
-- \"parity\" (cf. above) to be preserved for existing pensions 
of current and currently-eligible pensioners, and for other 
current public sector, but with definition of parity for the 
latter category left to a future complementary law. 
 
GoB Spin, Market\'s Placidity 
---------------------------- 
8. (U) The acceptance of \"integral\" pensions represents an 
abandonment of the GoB\'s original goal of early transition 
towards a unified social-security system with an eventual 
common ceiling for public- and private-sector pensions so as 
to curtail the grossly inequitable privileges enjoyed by 
Brazil\'s high-paid civil servants (Ref B).  Defenders see it 
as a vital, if ugly, GoB compromise to gain legislative and 
Supreme Court approval of a pension reform that will bring 
Brazil at least the minimum fiscal benefits needed to keep 
the markets sunny.  Grandfathering all current workers\' 
benefits could save the final reform from judicial challenges 
based on loose interpretation of the Constitutional principle 
of \"acquired rights\" that cannot be withdrawn.  Politically, 
the primary gain of the last fortnight\'s bargaining is that 
the governors seem warily back on board.  In Congress, there 
is grumbling that the GoB walked back too much at the 
governors\' behest, but no sign of major mutiny. 
 
9. (U) Fiscally, the GoB claims its shift preserves the 
reform\'s \"spinal cord\" by improving the pension system\'s mid- 
to-long term financial viability.  The GoB\'s prime assertion 
is that, thanks to the major increases in mimimum-age and 
length-of-work requirements, federal savings will not be 
meaningfully reduced by the extension of integral pensions. 
Under the original design, those savings were supposed to 
total 52.4 billion Reals through 2023.  With the changes, 
they will be 50.7 billion.  (Note:  no methodology details 
available; these figures refer to federal civil servants 
only, excluding state and local public sectors, the military, 
firemen, and others.  End Note.) 
 
10. (U) For now, financial markets evidently take the GoB 
case at face value.  Global-bank analyses we read all treat 
the revised pension-reform bill as being acceptable, as does 
the IMF, to judge from its indirect commentary.  The recent 
uncertainties have had next to no effect on the exchange 
rate, while Brazil\'s country risk resumed its decline in July 
and is now at its lowest level since March 2002. 
 
Fiscally Okay, but Politically Damaging? 
---------------------------------------- 
11. (SBU) Fair enough, perhaps, in a green-eyeshade way.  Yet 
the risk of collateral political damage to Lula seems high. 
There isn\'t even much assurance that the pension bill will 
pass Congress in its new form.  By ceding so much when the 
bill was at merely the second of seven legislative voting 
stages, the government may appear to have encouraged every 
interest group to stonewall for extra concessions.  The GoB\'s 
intent to start taxing retirees\' pensions is the most obvious 
likely target.  Raising the survivor\'s-benefit ceiling is 
another.  State and municipal judiciary employees demand that 
their salary sub-ceiling go back up to 90.25% of Supreme 
Court Justices\', not the 75% demanded by the governors, and 
have declared they will strike August 5-12. 
 
12. (SBU) More generally, the back-and-forth over pensions 
has let doubt be posed as to how clear, set and stable in its 
reform course the GoB really is.  We believe such doubts are 
misplaced.  But it is a fact that Lula\'s team has accepted a 
succession of major alterations to the design that it 
initially was adamant be taken as a whole.  And their 
statements on pension issues - including Lula\'s own -- have 
often contradicted or reversed themselves.  Hitherto, as a 
veteran interlocutor recently put it to us, most of Brazil\'s 
body politic seemed ready to board Lula\'s reform train, as 
long as he was driving it and taking the heat.  Now, they can 
feel there is a political premium, and no penalty, in 
opposing his measures. 
 
13. (U) Most immediately, this could affect Lula\'s tax-reform 
bill.  Since the pension-bill\'s re-working, governors have 
been holding out for three compensatory alterations in the 
GoB\'s tax-reform bill:  for states to share both the CPMF and 
CIDE taxes (each of which currently accrues 100% to the 
Union); for extra funds to compensate states for revenue 
losses stemming from the federal Kandir Law (which exempts 
exports from major taxes); and for lesser earmarking 
requirements on transfers from the federal treasury.  If 
pension and tax reform bog down in a cycle of demands and 
concessions, Brazil\'s fiscal future and Lula\'s political 
stature will both be hard-hit. 
 
Stiffened GoB Stance 
-------------------- 
14. (U) The GoB is well aware of these considerations.  Lula, 
Berzoini and Dirceu as well as Palocci all are loudly warning 
that the government has reached the limit of its concessions 
vis-a-vis pension reform.  In a personal meeting, Lula told 
the CUT (largest labor federation) leader that the GoB would 
introduce no further changes to its proposals.  The 
administration responded to the state judges\' strike threat 
with a refusal to entertain any negotiations, and Lula in a 
July 24 speech blasted their demands.  And in its strongest 
show of renewed force, the administration on July 23 rammed 
the reform bill through the Chamber\'s special committee 
without further change by a 30-8 vote. 
 
15. (U) The bill must now pass two Chamber floor votes, of 
which the first is expected in early August and the second 
probably not before September, with 60% majorities (Ref A). 
It would then go to the Senate\'s Justice Committee for a 
ruling on constitutionality and thence to the Senate floor 
for a further two votes, also requiring 60% majorities, the 
second of which is not generally expected before January.  By 
all media accounts, Lula and Planalto are determined to take 
over direct management of the bills\' legislative advance. 
 
16. (SBU) Such signs of fresh resolve offer hope that Lula 
and team have absorbed lessons from the latest rough-and- 
tumble of the pension-reform process.  Should they hold their 
re-configured line, the result will probably deserve to be 
deemed a success.  But the prospect now looks more unsure.

SUBJECT: PENSION REFORM CLEARS HURDLE IN BRAZILIAN CHAMBER 
OF DEPUTIES 
 
REF: BRASILIA 2407 
 
1. (U) Summary: Early on 6 August the Chamber of Deputies 
(the lower house of Brazil\'s congress) passed a 
constitutional amendment bill that, if it ultimately becomes 
law, would radically change Brazil\'s public sector pension 
system. Key features of the measure are analyzed in reftel 
and para 4 below. Passage of the proposal has become a test 
of the Lula government\'s will and capacity to make 
fundamental reforms in Brazil. Possible \"destaques\" 
(\"observations\") on the text -- some of them controversial -- 
will be debated later in the plenary, but congressional 
sources believe the government has the votes to defeat these 
challenges, despite continuing protests by public sector 
employees.  The final text will be put to an obligatory 
second vote in the plenary later this month, and if again 
supported, will move to the Brazilian Senate. End Summary 
 
The Process 
----------- 
 
2.  (U) To carry the measure, the government needed a 
three-fifths majority (308 votes). The amendment bill passed 
by a 358-126 vote margin, with nine abstentions.  About 100 
\"destaques\" (\"observations\" or \"highlights\") to the text were 
proposed throughout August 5, but only 14 reportedly survived 
for debate later (time not yet set) in the plenary.  These 
\"destaques\" deal with controversial aspects of the amendment, 
including contributions to the retirement system by 
inactive/retired employees, and modifications to contribution 
requirements for individuals with multiple income sources. 
While these will be hotly debated, one congressional source 
told poloffs the government coalition has sufficient votes to 
defeat these challenges.  Large-scale demonstrations occurred 
around the congress in Brasilia throughout the day on 6 
August, as different interest groups sought to put pressure 
on legislators and the GOB. 
 
3.  (U) Constitutional amendments require two plenary votes, 
separated in time by at least five plenary sessions, but the 
second vote normally serves to formalize the text (plus 
agreed-to \"highlights\") approved in the first round of 
voting.  A second and final vote could occur as early as next 
week, or as late as the first week in September. 
 
 
The Substance 
------------- 
 
4.  (U) Reftel provides details of the bill voted this week. 
Substantively, the bill\'s latest version incorporated GOB 
concessions arising from negotiations with government allies. 
The key change was GOB acceptance of a sub-ceiling for state 
judiciary salaries (85.5 percent of federal salaries), 
somewhat higher than what was originally offered (75 
percent).  The compromise came after Lula himself publicly 
dug in his heels against the 90-plus percent demanded by the 
state judges.  Other eleventh-hour adjustments were: (1) more 
generous guidelines for survivor benefits; (2) a higher floor 
for taxation of pensions, now to begin at 1,200 rather than 
the 1,058 reals per month that had been proposed; (3) an 11 
percent pay premium for the 100,000-plus public sector 
workers who already qualify for retirement under existing age 
and time of service requirements (as an incentive for them 
not to retire before they satisfy the bill\'s new minimum 
limits). 
 
5.  (SBU) Comment: Further pitfalls remain.  One 
controversial point for debate, and a possible judicial 
challenge later, will be the provision to begin taxing 
pensions.  Former President Cardoso\'s effort along those 
lines were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. 
Pension reform is a vital necessity for Brazil\'s long-term 
economic health, since the country cannot sustain the huge 
fiscal deficits due in considerable measure to paying highly 
generous benefits to retired civil servants.  In its eight 
years in office, the Cardoso Administration was unable to 
secure significant public sector pension change. The reform 
measure passed Aug. 6 goes to the heart of long-standing 
entitlements viewed as sacred by employees in Brazil\'s huge 
public sector.   If a meaningful bill survives the political 
and judicial challenges that still loom, the Lula government 
will deserve major credit for demonstrating both the 
political courage to take on this critical issue and the 
skill to see it through. The jury is still out on that latter 
quality.  End comment.

SUBJECT:  Central Bank Eases Reserve Requirement 
 
 
1.  The Central Bank (CB) on Friday August 8 reduced its 
reserve requirement on banks\' demand deposits from 60 to 45%. 
That requirement thus reverts to what had been its long-term 
level from June 2000 until the CB raised it in February of 
this year, at the peak of Brazil\'s recent inflation 
uncertainties, in tandem with what was then the second 
successive monthly hike under the new GoB of the SELIC 
benchmark interest rate.  (Prior to March 2000, the reserve 
requirement was actually higher, at 65%.)  The change does 
not affect requirement on term deposits or savings accounts, 
which remain at 23 and 30%, respectively. 
 
2.  Effective August 11, this move will free up eight billion 
Reals (about USD 2.7 billion) for banks\' use, according to 
the CB\'s Monetary Policy Department.  The GoB hopes this 
money will be put to benign effect in the form of expanding 
credit and reducing interest rates.  Brazil\'s three biggest 
national retail banks (Bradesco, Itau and Unibanco) have 
already announced modest adjustments of some retail interest 
rates -- from 9.3 and 9.35% to 8.7 and 8.9% per month (sic), 
respectively, on private check-credit rates by Bradesco and 
Itau, for example. 
 
3.  The drop had been universally awaited as a signal of the 
GoB\'s anti-recessionary resolution.  However, no-one believes 
its direct effect will be anything more than marginal in 
fomenting economic revival.  Numerous commentators note, in 
fact, that lack of demand for credit in Brazil\'s somber 
current economic landscape may result in the freed-up funds 
not going towards new loans at all, just into banks\' 
purchases of more GoB bonds, or of foreign currency. 
 
4.  The CB announcement came against a background of ever- 
intensifying demands for GoB policies to stimulate growth, 
plus work on a vaguely-described GoB package of emergency 
measures (Septel).  As token of the pressure, Chief of Staff 
Dirceu had earlier been quoted conspicuously out-of-portfolio 
as promising Brazil\'s governors that the reserve requirement 
would be lowered by week\'s end.  Amidst some media reports 
that the decision was resisted by Central Bank professionals, 
Finance Minister Palocci has since made a point of stressing 
that it was made on purely technical, not political grounds, 
and was justified by positive developments in Brazil\'s 
inflation data and expectations. 
 
5.  A senior CB contact volunteered to us Friday afternoon 
that the reserve-requirement change\'s impact seemed to have 
been even more modest than the Monetary Policy Department had 
hoped, to judge from the early exchange-rate reaction.  He 
implied further cuts in the rate might be considered, even 
though, at 45%, it is now as low as it has been for years. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  Brazil\'s economic focus will now be fixed on 
the COPOM\'s (Monetary Policy Committee) next decision 
concerning the SELIC rate, at its monthly meeting on August 
20.  With figures for industrial production showing a 
sectoral recession already under way, and with recent 
inflation numbers at least slightly better than had been 
feared, clamor can only grow for the COPOM to chop the SELIC 
by more than the 1.5% (from its present 24.5%) that the 
market has already begun to anticipate.  We expect the CB 
not/not to bend to ongoing public and political protests over 
the Lula administration\'s economic-policy course, but nor do 
those protests look likely to abate

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ENRG, EINV, EFIN, PGOV, ECON, BR 
SUBJECT: MINISTER ROUSSEFF EXPLAINS NEW ENERGY MODEL 
 
REF: BRASILIA 00835 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  Mines and Energy Minister Rousseff and 
Vice Minister Tolmasquim have provided EmbOffs a two-hour 
presentation of Brazil\'s new energy model.  The Minister 
summed up the new model as re-establishing the concept of 
public service as the sector\'s prevalent principle.  It 
aspires to better segregate GoB energy planning, regulation, 
and policy, while providing moderate prices to consumers, 
reasonable compensation to generators and distributors, and 
decreased risks in energy generation.  The vigor and 
resolution of this special presentation was impressive, but 
it seemed to leave many practical core issues unresolved, as 
our sampling of private-sector contacts has subsequently 
confirmed.  A common industry view, in fact, is that the 
GoB,s design to date does not yet merit the appellation of a 
full model.  That it will be ready for initial implementation 
in January 2004, as the Minister insists, seems unlikely. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
Work In Progress 
--------------------- 
2.  (U) The GoB,s new model was first presented to the 
National Electrical Power Policy Council on July 21. 
Honoring a promise that Minister of Mines and Energy (MME) 
Rousseff had made to Ambassador at a previous one-on-one 
lunch, the Minister and Vice Minister Tolmasquim dedicated 
two and a half hours to a special meeting with Ambassador and 
six embassy officers to explain the plan. 
 
3.  (U) The Minister prefaced her presentation by asserting 
that Brazil\'s existing energy model, launched in the early 
1990s, had proved a fourfold failure.  It had not resulted in 
moderate prices; it had not stimulated expansion; it had not 
brought investors needed assurances; and it had contributed 
to Brazil\'s financial crisis, she said.  The new GoB,s model 
was aimed to put &the concept of public service8 back into 
the sector\'s management as its prevailing principle.  At the 
same time, it is designed to respect existing contracts, 
minimize transaction costs, preclude tariff pressures 
resulting in higher consumer costs, ensure transparency, and 
create a favorable environment for long-term investment. 
Implementation is to begin Jan. 2004, with a transition 
period of two to three years, the Minister said.   Little 
concrete would change in 2004, she noted, since most of 
Brazil\'s energy delivery for that year is already under 
existing contracts. 
 
Main New Elements 
------------------------ 
4.  (U) In particular, the new model aims to:  define rules 
that limit the National Agency for Electrical Energy\'s 
(ANEEL) role to regulation without policy consequences or 
implications; solidify policy control in the ministry; and 
create The Energy Studies and Planning Foundation (FEPE), an 
independent GoB planning body akin to the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA), to forecast supply and 
demand.  The FEPE is to review energy production, monitor 
climate conditions, and track consumer demand to project 
future generation needs.  The long-term plan of twenty years 
is to be reviewed every four years and revised as required. 
Long and mid-term planning will be submitted to public 
hearings.  (NOTE:  The Minister reiterated her eagerness, 
expressed at her meeting with Secretary Abraham during the 
June presidential summit, for EIA technical assistance for 
FEPE.  A team will be coming to Brasilia the week of Sept. 
15.  END NOTE) 
 
5. (U)  At the core of the new model is a total re-design of 
the way electricity is sold.  Sales are to take place within 
two contractual environments overseen by the Electric Energy 
Contracts Administration Authority (ACEE), which is to 
replace the never-functional Wholesale Electricity Market 
(MAE).  ACEE will be linked to the Ministry of Mines and 
Energy (MME) and will take over the relevant organizational 
and operational structures of MAE.  ACEE will calculate 
tariffs based on a yet-to-be-determined index.  The largest 
volume of energy will be through a pool which will blend 
prices between Brazil\'s lower-priced hydro energy and more 
expensive thermal energy.  This is a critical change, since 
the generators will now be regulated regarding to whom and at 
what terms they sell their energy.  All distributors will buy 
energy at a set price from the mix of generators supplying 
power to the pool, with all contracts being administered by 
ACEE.  Currently, there are sixty-four distributors that will 
be mandated to contract through this pool. 
 
6.  (U)  The balance of energy supply will be allowed to be 
contracted through bilateral agreements between Independent 
Power Producers (IPP) and \"free\" consumers.  Free consumers 
are entities with energy needs above 3000 megawatts (e.g., 
shopping malls).  They may become captive with a five-year 
notice.  The new model also allows captive consumers to 
become free with the same notice.  Captive consumers may 
become free with just a two-year notice if they are going to 
be supplied by a renewable energy source.  This is the new 
model\'s incentive (the only one, so far) to create demand for 
renewable energy sources, yet its long-term goal is to have 
10% of consumption come from such sources.  New thermal power 
plants will only be authorized to generate as IPPs, and must 
have a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) before construction 
begins. An energy reserve will be maintained as cushion 
against shortages. The cost will be passed on to all 
customers through tariffs. 
 
7.  (U) The new Energy Sector Monitoring Committee (CMSE) is 
to be coordinated by the MME and aided by FEPE, ACEE, ANEEL, 
and the administrator of contracting transmission facilities, 
the National Electrical System Operator (ONS).  This entity 
will be responsible for oversight and assure the consistency 
of supply.  CMSE will monitor projected demands, and ACEE 
will collect penalties for any deviations from a 
distributor\'s forecast of more than five percent either way 
at the end of the five-year contract period.  Fines will be 
imposed for both negative and positive deviations, with the 
former being more severe. 
 
8.  (U)  The new model expressly forbids &self-dealing8. 
For example, CEMIG (Brazil\'s largest generator, which has 
Southern Electric as its strategic U.S. partner), both 
generates and distributes electricity.  Under the new model, 
such companies will have to split up.  The newly formed 
generation company will have to sell its energy to the 
national pool, and the new distributor will buy it at a set 
price from a part of their old company and old competitors. 
For the same reason, the state of Parana\'s Governor Requiao 
has declared that he will refuse to have COPEL (Parana,s 
state electricity company) participate in the pool.  He 
asserts that the state will continue to be supplied directly 
by COPEL\'s low cost hydro energy and only put up surplus 
energy to the pool. 
 
Private-Sector Industry Reactions 
---------------------------------------- 
9.  (SBU)  Since the Minister\'s private brief, we have met 
with Sao Paulo State\'s Secretary of Energy, three association 
leaders, the president of a power producer, and the CFO of a 
power distributor to gauge reactions to the new model. 
Uncertainty was palpable in all of the meetings.  All our 
interlocutors were particularly concerned that the cost 
index, which is to be the future basis for revising the 
tariff, has not been formulated.  There was resentment at 
this model having been allegedly created in a vacuum without 
input from stakeholders in industry and associations. 
(COMMENT:  In contrast, Rousseff prides herself on the 
transparent, inclusive consultations she believes the 
Ministry has conducted.  END COMMENT) 
 
10.  (SBU)  Beyond these common initial reactions, we have 
heard individual concerns and observations.   Sao Paulo 
State\'s Energy Secretary Mauro Jardim Arce was the only one 
who expressed the need to get the model hammered out as soon 
as possible to stabilize the sector.  He commented that 
monthly consumption is down 40% compared to pre-rationing 
levels.  The current over-capacity and dollar-denominated 
debt of companies in the sector is not addressed in the plan, 
Arce also pointed out. 
 
11.  (SBU)  Silvia Calou, the Executive Director of ABCE (a 
67 year old association with 70 member companies involved in 
generation, transmission, and distribution), said ABCE\'s 
primary concern is that the model is built on flawed GDP 
forecasting with exaggerated optimistic projections which 
will result in over-investment and excess capacity.  She 
expects this scenario eventually to result in large tariff 
increases which will induce lower consumption.  The five-year 
planning cycle makes the distributors vulnerable to market 
forecast risk.  While the \"transparency\" portion of the new 
model allows bids to be contested, it is unclear how this 
will be done, and the association\'s members fear some may 
have more information than others, which will impact bidding. 
 
 
12.  (SBU) Most negative has been Claudio Sales, president of 
CBIEE, an association of the 15 largest private investors in 
the energy sector, including U.S., Brazilian, French, 
Spanish, Portuguese, and Belgian companies.  He was vocal 
about his distaste for the plan, forged, in Sales,s words, 
by \"politically biased scholars\".  It addresses the future, 
he said, but doesn\'t address the \"present, reality, and 
survival\".  But Sales also predicted that the model\'s 
\"craziness\" will be trumped, asserting that his association 
has the ear and support of Finance Minister Palocci, to whom 
CBIEE is apparently putting forth counter-proposals for 
fixing the present tariff structure and the tracking 
accounts. 
 
13.  (SBU)  AES Tiete President Mark Green, on the other 
hand, was surprisingly serene about the new energy model.  He 
expressed confidence that it will leave AES Tiete,s 
generation contract unaffected until its scheduled expiration 
in 2015.  He was more concerned with the bidding process, 
however, in which consumers will only be looking at price. 
He believes if bidding rules aren\'t more tightly defined that 
producers will cut necessary operational redundancies to 
reduce costs in order to secure bids in that competitive 
environment.  Green noted that AES has a poor relationship 
with ANEEL, and liked the fact that the new model diminishes 
ANEEL,s authority.  AES Eletropaulo CFO Jeff Safford said 
his company was still formulating its opinion of the model, 
but initially believes it is too vague to attract new 
investment.  He concurred that AES feels itself ahead of the 
game since its generating (Tiete) and distribution 
(Eletropaulo) companies are already bifurcated.  Safford 
likewise expressed confidence that AES,s Tiete-Eletropaulo 
ANEEL-approved contracts would stand up through the life of 
their 15-year term. 
 
14.  (SBU)  Finally, Sao Paulo Econoff received additional 
input from an August 26-27 FIESP energy seminar in Sao Paulo. 
 Players on the generation and transmission side expressed 
relative contentment with the new model, which they feel 
insulates them from most market risk.  However, other agents 
in the production chain (e.g., distributors and free 
consumers) continue to express deep concern that the model as 
it stands will not promote private investment or remove risk 
of future shortages.  In addition, private investors won\'t be 
interested in considering new activity until after 
legislative passage of the bill in its final form, when they 
know all of the rules and ramifications.  MME Vice Minister 
Tolmasquim attended this FIESP seminar, listened to concerns, 
and invited participants to provide input into the final 
model. 
 
15.  (SBU)  COMMENT: In our private briefing, Minister 
Rousseff was adamant that the bill enshrining the new model 
would be passed in time for implementation to begin by Jan. 
1, 2004.  This looks unrealistic, given stake-holders\' 
abiding uncertainties and the fact that the necessary rules 
and regulations underpinning the model have not been defined, 
plus the scant prospect of legislative action in this time 
frame, considering President Lula\'s time-consuming priorities 
of pension and tax reform.  The long-awaited new energy model 
has already slipped well behind the ambitious original 
timeframe for its introduction.  That said, most in industry 
and the government alike would concur that it is more crucial 
to do this change well than to do it rapidly.  And on the 
positive side, it does appear that private-sector actors are 
being consulted and given the chance to make their points 
adequately at this stage of the model\'s refinement. END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  Tax Reform: GoB Passes Its Latest Legislative Test 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  Lula\'s administration has recorded its latest 
key legislative win, with the Chamber of Deputies\' 378-53 
approval of the GoB tax-reform bill on September 4.  In so 
doing, the GoB was compelled to make some relatively minor 
extra concessions to Brazil\'s governors.  All observers 
predict the bill will undergo further major re-working in 
the Senate; there is little hope for final passage before 
mid-November at best.  The GoB may consider detaching and 
submitting separately the bill\'s two elements that it wants 
approved by October: extension of the \"temporary\" CPMF levy 
and of the `DRU\' (long-standing federal-government authority 
to de-link 20 percent of its revenues from required 
earmarks.)  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  The September 4 vote was the first of the Chamber\'s two 
required floor votes on the tax-reform bill.  Dozens of 
amendments remain to be voted on to complete the first-round 
process, which should be finalized by the middle of the week 
of September 8.  Thereafter, five Chamber sessions with a 
quorum must take place before the second-round vote may 
occur.  Thus, that vote could occur in the September 17-24 
timeframe.  Provided the bill gets the necessary three- 
fifths majority again, it will proceed to the Senate Justice 
Committee for routine determination of its 
constitutionality, and thence to the Senate floor for the 
required pair of plenary votes there.  A notional timetable 
in the September 5 `Estado de Sao Paulo\' forecast the Senate 
committee reporting out the bill in late October, and the 
second-round Senate floor vote occurring in mid-November. 
 
3.  The Chamber floor vote came at 3 a.m. September 4, in an 
extraordinary session convened by Speaker Cunha, after 
sixteen hours of turbulent negotiations.  The GoB had been 
adamant about holding a vote in the Chamber\'s September 3 
session and hoped to pass the bill quickly that afternoon. 
But resistance from governors -- particularly Aecio Neves 
(PSDB-Minas Gerais) -- raised the prospect of the GoB\'s 
losing the vote outright, and impelled Lula\'s team to make 
further concessions to the governors.  These negotiations 
delayed the voting until the early hours of Thursday, at 
which point the GoB submitted its revised bill.  With the 
governors\' and mayors\' backing, that bill passed with an 
impressive 70 votes to spare. 
 
4.  GoB leaders immediately pointed out that the final 
result had featured near-impeccable voting discipline 
throughout the government\'s alliance base. In fact, the PT- 
led coalition, even without any opposition support, 
delivered more than enough votes to pass the bill, 
suggesting that the government\'s late-night courting of the 
powerful PSDB governors had been unnecessary.  This vote 
thus contrasted favorably with the pension-reform bill\'s key 
recent victory in the Chamber, which would not have been won 
without votes of parties outside the GoB coalition. 
Moreover, the solid support this time from the PMDB party 
(70 of 77 PMDB deputies supported Lula\'s bill) is seen as 
proof that Lula\'s intensified courtship of the PMDB has 
borne fruit.  The opposition PSDB party vote split down the 
middle (24 yea, 26 nay), while PFL deputies opposed en masse 
and walked out when they saw they were going to lose. 
 
5.  The GoB\'s last-minute concessions to the governors 
consisted of: adding a further billion Reals (for a total of 
6.7 billion) to the fund for compensating states\' revenue 
losses on exports due to the Kandir law; adding two billion 
Reals (making a total of eight billion) to the prospective 
new compensation mechanism for ensuring states against 
revenue decreases arising from the eventual reform of the 
ICMS tax; and ceding to governors the control over resources 
from the new regional development fund already promised as 
part of the same tax reform.  Numerous `retail\' deals with 
individual states were evidently also made, notably with Rio 
state after Finance Minister Palocci met with Rio governor 
Rosinha Mattheus. 
 
6.  The GoB had previously agreed to concede one-quarter 
(approximately 2.2 billion Reals annually) of Brazil\'s 
national CIDE (fuel) tax to states and municipalities.  But 
it has held firm in its rejection of governors\' demands for 
a comparable share of the CPMF (financial transactions) 
levy, which totals over twenty billion Reals annually. 
 
7.  Other main elements of the tax-reform bill were left 
unaffected by the last-minute September 4 horse-trading. 
Chief amongst these: 
 
-- The ICMS tax is to be phased into a national, VAT-like 
tax with five basic rates, imposed at point of sale rather 
than of production.  Transitional time-frame, mechanisms for 
defining rates and categories, and limits or ceilings to the 
rates, remain almost entirely undefined; 
 
-- To do away with Brazil\'s `fiscal wars,\' whereby states 
use tax lures for new industry, all fiscal incentives of 
this type are supposed to discontinue after September 30; 
 
-- New tax relief on capital goods; 
 
-- Introduction of a progressive inheritance-tax rate (up to 
a maximum of 15%, vs. the present uniform four percent.) 
 
8.  The bill contains two other main elements central to GoB 
fiscal authority:  the extension after December 31 of 
Brazil\'s `temporary\' CPMF (financial services levy) and of 
the `DRU\' (a mechanism giving the GoB freedom to allocate 
twenty percent of its tax revenues away from earmarked 
purposes.)  By most traditional juridical interpretation, if 
Congress does not by September 30 approve these extensions, 
the GoB\'s authority in both areas will lapse on January 1, 
2004.  Precedent suggests that the GoB would find some way 
round this supposed constitutional constraint, but a growing 
number of voices is urging that it detach and submit 
separately for early passage this component of its tax- 
reform bill. 
 
9.  COMMENT:  The Chamber\'s approval of the tax-reform bill 
preserves the legislative momentum of Lula\'s fiscal reforms. 
With respect to substantive content, however, that bill has 
become decidedly under-whelming.  Enthusiasm for it has 
waned in the private-sector and perhaps especially amongst 
the ranks of Brazil\'s governors and mayors (Septel).  A 
common assumption now is that its main result may be just a 
further increase in Brazil\'s tax burden.  The near-universal 
forecast is that it is liable to undergo major further 
recasting before final passage through the Chamber -- let 
alone when it reaches the Senate, where over twenty sitting 
members are former governors.

SUBJECT: Brazil: Build-Up to Possible Follow-On IMF Agreement 
 
 
1. (SBU) IMF ResRep Zandamela told us September 16 that the 
crux of any follow-on IMF program for Brazil after its 
current one expires this December will be whether the two 
sides can devise a mutually satisfactory formula stipulating 
that the GoB may only use its IMF funds with the IMF\'s 
explicit approval.  Whether to commence negotiations towards 
such an agreement will be decided jointly at the GoB/IMF 
meetings during the imminent World Bank/IMF annual meeting in 
Doha.  Actual negotiations would start in October. 
 
2. (SBU) Zandamela drew attention to the hypothetical option 
of Brazil\'s resorting to an IMF Contingency Credit Line 
(CCL).  The relatively new CCL facility offers lower interest 
rates than the Supplemental Reserve Facility used in Brazil\'s 
current IMF agreement, but is also of more restricted use. 
It presupposes that the beneficiary country does not/not face 
major structural balance-of-payments problems or external- 
account risks, and is meant exclusively to insure against 
contagion from new international shocks. 
 
3. (SBU) We asked whether it was not politically key from the 
GoB\'s angle that any IMF facility/agreement be seen to offer 
fresh features taking into account Brazil\'s current economic 
circumstances -- e.g., exemption of other infrastructure 
investment from primary-budget computations as is already 
allowed with Petrobras investments; inclusion of social or 
growth targets, etc.  The ResRep, surprisingly to us, 
dismissed such considerations as neither likely nor relevant. 
 
4. (U) Meanwhile the GoB is preparing Brazil\'s political 
ground for measured, matter-of-fact treatment of potential 
IMF negotiations.  A fortnight ago, Finance Minister Palocci 
declared, on the occasion of drawing the latest tranche under 
Brazil\'s current agreement, that Brazil is almost (but by 
implication not quite) at the stage of being able to do 
without an IMF program.  Last week, President Lula sounded 
publicly equable about a new program but stressed that it 
would be negotiated, if at all, \"without a rope around our 
neck.\"  Former Central Bank Chairman Fraga earned front-page 
headlines the next day by saying Brazil would now be better 
off without an IMF program, since it could thereby prove that 
its responsible economic policies are due to GoB choice, not 
IFI conditionality. 
 
5. (U) Abroad, IMF Director-General Kohler has been quoted as 
apparently also opining that Brazil could do without a new 
IMF agreement.  Brazilian commentators\' expectations are that 
any IMF program would be for no more than a year in length 
and ten billion dollars in size, more than half of which 
would simply compensate for GoB repayments due on IMF money 
already received.  Some go on to speculate that the IMF\'s own 
institutional interest is tied to the ongoing success of its 
Brazil relationship, as a favorable contrast to its history 
with Argentina, and suggest that this alleged factor will 
strengthen the GoB\'s bargaining stance. 
 
6. (U) Brazil\'s net reserves have slowly risen by a couple of 
billion dollars since 2002 but as of July 2003 were still 
under 18 billion dollars, discounting the 30-plus billion 
Brazil also holds in IMF loans.  (By the IMF\'s own, different 
methodology, net reserves are actually below 15 billion 
dollars.)  This net figure would probably be too small to 
deal with an event of the order of the near-panic of 2002 -- 
let alone of Brazil\'s 1998-99 crisis, when dozens of billions 
of dollars drained in capital flight, admittedly under a 
fixed exchange-rate regime to which the nation is no longer 
hostage.  Brazil\'s scheduled foreign-debt payments for 2004 
are heavier than in 2003, and no prudent debt-manager can 
rule out foreign shock. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT. Though Brazil may not absolutely need a 
follow-on IMF agreement, few doubt it would be desirable. 
Even so, we tentatively suspect that Lula\'s GoB will press, 
harder than the IMF ResRep may expect, for the agreement to 
contain some feature that it can point to as at least a 
symbolically significant gesture towards the ongoing strains 
in Brazil\'s `real economy.\'  Does Brazil have enough 
negotiating leverage with the IMF to make any such deviation 
from orthodoxy thinkable?  The IMF ResRep may just have been 
suggesting that the IMF and GoB will seek a formula to put 
off any hard bargaining over conditionality until the point 
where Brazil actually asks to draw down.  That way, Brazil 
would have the ostensible insurance of an agreement without 
having to make unpalatable new commitments.

SUBJECT:  BRAZIL: LOOSE TALK ABOUT BNDES CREDIT FOR CUBA 
 
REF: BRASILIA 2994 
 
1. (U) Some local media late last week reported that 
President Lula\'s upcoming call on Castro in Havana would 
feature the announcement of a USD 400 million line of credit 
from BNDES, Brazil\'s national development bank.  Though 
loosely headlined as GoB \"aid,\" the money in question by all 
appearances would merely consist of financing for Brazilian 
exports of goods and services to Cuba. 
 
2. (U) Saturday\'s `Estado do Sao Paulo\' carried a dismissive 
reaction from BNDES chief Carlos Lessa, denying knowledge of 
any plan for BNDES to extend such credit to Cuba.  Perhaps 
lending Lessa\'s statement extra credence is the fact that he 
has a long leftist ideological pedigree.  After citing 
Lessa\'s rebuttal, `Estado\' recounted other, unidentified 
sources\' explanation that the $400 million initiative was 
merely in the process of being proposed or explored by 
Brazil\'s Foreign Ministry in the run-up to Lula\'s visit. 
 
3. (SBU) Lula\'s GoB has formed the habit of demonstratively 
committing BNDES to large volumes of new financing earmarks 
at his various LatAm summits:  a billion dollars each to 
Argentina and Venezuela alone, plus lesser amounts for 
Bolivia and Peru, already this year.  While making a recent 
unrelated demarche (Reftel), we were told by a senior Finance 
Ministry official -- who remains technically a BNDES employee 
even after spending his last professional decade elsewhere in 
GoB Ministries and at the World Bank -- in effect not to take 
these declarations seriously.  BNDES\'s institutional charter, 
means, and domestic priorities alike all stand in the way, 
this official volunteered. 
 
4. (U) Even if ultimately committed, the BNDES funds would 
have little visible use in Cuba\'s case.  Brazil\'s exports to 
Cuba were just USD 120 million in 2001 and fell to USD 95 
million in 2002.  Main export items are chicken, shoes and 
agricultural machinery.  There are apparently aspirations for 
new sales of spare parts for buses and trucks; a Brazilian 
company called Busscar, based in Brazil\'s Santa Catarina 
state, has been co-producing buses for sale in Cuba and 
Central American countries for the past four years, according 
to business daily `Valor Economico.\'  Brazil\'s annual 
purchases from Cuba have hovered in the ten-million-dollar 
range.

SUBJECT: AMORIM BRIEFS CONGRESS ON CANCUN MINISTERIAL 
 
 
1.  ECONFSN attended the September 17 presentation on 
WTO issues by Brazil\'s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim to 
the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee after 
the FM\'s return from the 9/10-14 Cancun Ministerial. 
This was FM Amorim\'s second appearance this month 
before the Committee at the latter\'s invitation.  His 
tone was confident but restrained, with no hint of 
triumphalism despite the many accolades to him from 
deputies and parts of Brazil\'s media since Cancun\'s 
denouement.  Following are the main points addressed 
during FM Amorim\'s 45-minute testimony followed by a 75- 
minute Q and A session. 
 
2.  Points made: 
 
--  It is too early for a complete detailed analysis of 
the Cancun meeting, as the Brazilian delegation members 
were still digesting the events and implications. 
 
-- G22 genesis:  in the past, the U.S. had aligned with 
the Cairns Group versus the EU; this time the U.S. and 
EU had come to Cancun with a joint defensive position. 
Having Mexico as the conference leader and Singapore as 
Ag facilitator helped allow the formation of the G22 
(or, Amorim said, the G20+, as he expects more 
inclusions.) 
 
-- The raising of Singapore issues by the conference 
had caused a mutiny by India and \"little-bitty\" 
(\"pequeninos\") countries. 
 
-- The WTO remains the legitimate, \"non-replaceable\" 
forum in which Brazil should pursue its trade 
interests.  Amorim repeatedly stressed this point.  He 
also made clear that, in Brazil\'s view, Cancun was not 
a failure, and the Doha Round negotiations are an 
ongoing process which will not fade away.  It is better 
for Brazil that the Round \"skid\" for six months or even 
a year so as to end up with a sufficient agreement than 
to wait fifteen years for a new WTO round to give 
desired results.  He added that, although still not 
ideal, the Conference\'s paper on agriculture at the end 
of the event was better than the initial one. 
 
-- The G20+ is a coalition only for agricultural 
matters.  A G20+ meeting is likely to be held at some 
point, during which implications of the end of the 
Peace Clause in December may be considered.  After the 
expiration of the Peace Clause there will be potential 
WTO cases from which Brazil can benefit; however, said 
Amorim, \"rhetorical battle\" should be avoided. 
 
-- The coalition of the G20+ has brought more 
equilibrium into the WTO.  Given that the new group 
represents 65% of the world\'s agricultural production 
and about half of the planet\'s population, the group 
has sufficient weight to negotiate with the U.S. and 
EU.  It did not split the \"monolith\" of the U.S. and 
EU, but found some \"cracks\" between them representing 
areas where advances can be made. 
 
 
-- Amorim was not sure why the EU backed down over 
Singapore issues and was willing to accept just one 
Singapore issue being discussed. 
 
-- Amorim said he did not believe the U.S. or the EU 
would retaliate against Brazil for the latter\'s conduct 
at Cancun.  He said the issues involved are ones that 
can be worked out in future negotiations.  He mentioned 
a timeframe of perhaps six months for negotiations on 
agriculture to pick up again. 
 
-- Asked about implications for ALCA, FM Amorim 
declined to comment for the moment, on the grounds that 
the subject needed a deeper assessment and that 
anything he would say would be reported nationwide, as 
the press was present in numbers.  He simply noted that 
one lesson had been learned by Brazil: if the agenda is 
too heavy, negotiations become complicated.  Amorim 
made a comparison to flying an overweighted airplane, 
and said he hoped other parties have learned the keep- 
it-simple lesson as well. 
 
-- Amorim likewise declined to respond to the question 
of whether the U.S. strategy to pursue bilateral trade 
agreements would weaken the G20+.  He only commented 
that countries considering negotiating bilaterally with 
the U.S. should think carefully, because to negotiate 
with a country that subsidizes its agricultural sector 
raises the possibility of damaging one\'s own 
agricultural sector. 
-- Amorim also made a reference in the middle of his 
speech to the EU being more protectionist than the U.S.

SUBJECT: NEW DECREE TO FACILITATE IMPORTATION OF COPIED DRUGS 
THROUGH COMPULSORY LICENSING 
 
REF:  SAO PAULO 1467 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY: The GoB has taken its latest step in laying 
the legal groundwork necessary to import copied versions of 
patented pharmaceuticals.  President Lula signed a decree on 
September 4 revising the implementation of Article 71 of 
Brazil\'s 1996 patent law, which governs the granting of 
compulsory licenses in cases of national emergency or public 
interest.  This decree ratchets up the Ministry of Health\'s 
bargaining power in its continuing negotiations with three drug 
companies over the prices of their AIDS antiretroviral 
medicines (reftel). The decree quickly followed the conclusion 
of the WTO agreement on access to medicines.  While it is 
unclear whether the revisions to Article 71 implementation 
legislation are TRIPS-compliant or even consistent with 
Brazil\'s own Constitution, the GoB believes it now has 
considerably more room to maneuver in cases of public urgency. 
The decree and the Health Ministry\'s dwindling stocks of the 
drugs in question indicate to us that the GoB is prepared to 
issue compulsory licenses and import if price negotiations are 
not concluded to its satisfaction.  Translated text of the 
decree from the State Department Translation Service is 
provided below (paragraph 16).  END SUMMARY. 
 
The Revisions and What They Mean 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  The most significant revision, in Article 10 of the 
decree, allows for the importation of the object of the 
compulsory license when it is not possible to address national 
emergency or public interest situations with a product on the 
domestic market, or when production by the State or a third 
party is not feasible.  The previous language of Article 10 
allowed for this circumstance \"provided that the product has 
been placed on the market directly by the owner or by consent 
of the owner,\" implying that consent by the patent owner was 
necessary before such (presumably parallel) importation could 
occur.  The replacement language of the new decree does not 
specify that any action by the patent holder is required. 
Pharmaceutical companies interpret this fact as giving the 
green light for imports without the patent holder\'s consent, 
permitting entry of knock-offs from countries where there is no 
patent. 
 
3.  (U) An additional paragraph under Article 10 states that 
the Union is obliged to acquire the product placed on the 
market by the owner or with the owner\'s consent (e.g. parallel 
imports), as long as that procedure does not frustrate the 
purposes of the license.  In essence, it would seem that the 
State can now choose the desired product source by merely 
alleging the patent owner is thwarting the purpose of the 
compulsory license, e.g., by not lowering prices. 
 
4.  (U) The new decree also deletes language in the previous 
version regarding the public bid process that was to govern the 
contracting of third parties to work compulsory licenses.  The 
public bid procedures outlined in a 1993 law are no longer to 
apply. A new paragraph states that patents under compulsory 
license shall be worked by third parties in compliance with the 
principles of Article 37 of the Constitution and other 
applicable legal standards.  Article 37 of the Constitution 
deals with public administration in general, and would impose 
more relaxed standards on the public bid process than those 
outlined in the 1993 law. 
 
5.  (U) Revisions of Article 5 clarify that the patent holder 
may be obliged to provide sufficient information to enable the 
reproduction of the object of the compulsory license.  The 
significant alteration in this article under the new decree is 
the threat of nullification of the patent should the transfer 
of know-how not be forthcoming. 
 
6.  (SBU) The Ministry of Health, in its announcement of the 
decree, characterized the measure as a legal instrument by 
which the Brazilian government can import copies in cases of 
national emergency or public interest without the necessity of 
the patent holder\'s consent.  In particular, the decree would 
allow importation of copies of the three AIDS anti-retrovirals 
that are currently the subject of price negotiations, should 
the government pursue compulsory licenses.  While MoH officials 
from the International Affairs office declined to comment on 
the ongoing negotiations with the three pharmaceutical 
companies (reftel) in a September 4 meeting with Econoffs, they 
portrayed the issue as a question of life and death for AIDS 
patients and thus also a political requirement for the GoB. 
 
7.  (U) Although the MoH\'s budget allocation decisions did not 
enter into the conversation with Econoffs, press accounts of 
the negotiations with pharmaceutical firms typically cite the 
Ministry\'s overburdened budget.  While seeking to lower costs 
of medicines in its AIDS program, the Ministry reportedly plans 
to increase spending on state-run pharmaceutical production 
facilities.  Local press reports of September 1 highlighted 
Health Minister Costa\'s announcement that 36 million reais 
(approximately $12.4 million USD) from the Ministry\'s 2003 
budget, formerly sequestered, are finally to be released to 
finance capacity building at state-owned laboratories.  The 
2004 budget draft increases that amount to 80 million reais. 
 
Industry Concern Deepens with New Decree in Place 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
8.  (SBU)  In a September 19 telcon with Embassy Econoff, Merck 
Communications Director Joao Sanches expressed his concern over 
what he characterized as growing anti-patent sentiment in 
Brazil.  He said the recent decree and several bills currently 
before Congress all seek to limit patent holder rights.  Citing 
assessments of the decree from Brazilian intellectual property 
lawyers, Sanches said that its constitutionality is 
questionable, as federal government actions are not supposed to 
impose additional requirements beyond the limits set by the 
law.   More optimistically, he stated that lower-level MoH 
contacts have told him the GoB does not want to employ the new 
decree, preferring a negotiated solution to the imposition of 
compulsory licensing. 
 
9.  (SBU)  In a separate September 19 meeting with Sao Paulo 
econoff, FCS principal commercial officer and Brazilian 
Research-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers\' Association 
(Interfarma) President Flavio Vormittag, Sanches expanded on 
the above concerns, highlighting what he characterized as the 
MoH\'s lack of response to industry overtures in the area of 
price reductions and the absence of open dialogue between the 
companies and the MoH during the negotiation process. 
According to Sanches, recent proposals by both Abbott and Roche 
were again refused by the MoH as unsatisfactory.  (Note: 
Sanches was disillusioned that the MoH has at no time during 
current negotiations recognized the significant price 
reductions the companies instituted over the past few years in 
support of Brazil\'s AIDS program.  Only two years ago, Merck 
received plaudits in the press and from the former head of 
Brazil\'s National AIDS program for the price cuts they 
delivered.  Roche also cut its price for Nelfinavir in almost 
half that same year.  End note.)  Sanches revealed that Merck 
had formally requested a 60-day extension (beyond the original 
August 31 deadline) from the MoH negotiating team so as to 
review the price reduction demands for Efavirenz in the context 
of Merck\'s global pricing policy.  Sanches emphasized that any 
changes to pricing levels in the Brazilian market would require 
buy-in from Merck\'s executive body.  The MoH had not formally 
responded to the extension request, but Sanches believed the 
MoH intended to send a formal communique this week in essence 
denying their appeal for an extended negotiating timeline. 
Sanches further stated that Merck\'s formal requests for a 
meeting with Minister Costa have gone unanswered.  According to 
Sanches, Costa has yet to receive representatives from any of 
the three companies since negotiations began. 
 
10.  (SBU)  Sanches reiterated Merck\'s position that the prices 
demanded by the MoH are below cost and even lower than those 
Merck has granted to least-developed countries in Africa.  He 
stated that they amount to a 45 percent reduction for Merck and 
an 84 percent reduction for Abbott (reftel).  Sanches mentioned 
that Merck has a contract with the GOB valid through the end of 
this year.  Despite the hard stance taken by the GoB, Sanches 
did not seem to think that the GoB would risk breaking the 
pricing contracts at this time and still sees some hope for 
negotiation on the pricing issue.  (Note: Sanches also stated 
that the price currently demanded by the GoB is lower even than 
that which can be obtained through importation of the drugs 
from India or China, and suggested that this supports the view 
that the GoB would prefer a negotiated solution to employing 
the new decree.  End note.) 
 
11.  (SBU)  While the GoB claims its revisions to Article 71 
implementation legislation are TRIPS-compliant, both Sanches 
and Vormittag disagree.  Interfarma has contracted a team of 
lawyers to review the two documents to determine whether or not 
the GoB would be violating TRIPS through the issuance of a 
compulsory license under the new decree. 
 
12.  (SBU) Both Vormittag and Sanches predicted that if a 
compulsory license were issued for anti-retrovirals, the GoB 
might decide to expand such action to other medications (i.e. 
vaccines, cancer, malaria, and tuberculosis), and even to other 
sectors (e.g. software).  They were fast to point out that the 
decree is not AIDS-drug-specific.  Vormittag opined that the 
GoB started with anti-retrovirals because AIDS is a high- 
profile issue, backed by a well-organized group in Brazil; 
universal access to medication for all AIDS patients is also 
written into Brazilian law, providing a more formidable basis 
for issuing compulsory licenses in the name of the public 
interest. 
 
Merck Contemplates Its Options 
------------------------------ 
 
13.  (SBU) Sanches admitted that at this time the least painful 
road for Merck to take would be to negotiate a smaller price 
reduction or agree to voluntary licensing.  Merck is currently 
working with a team from Fiocruz to analyze the technical 
requirements for manufacturing under a voluntary license.  The 
company has yet to make a final decision.  (Note: This is a 
change in stance from previous conversations with Sanches in 
that he now believes the MoH may accept one or the other 
demand, no longer obliging the patent-owners to comply with 
both requirements -- price reduction and voluntary licensing -- 
included in the original MoH Administrative Rule governing the 
negotiations.  End note.) 
Meanwhile, More Social-Policy Pressure 
-------------------------------------- 
 
14.  (U) The first National Conference on Medicines and 
Pharmaceutical Assistance took place in Brasilia September 15- 
18, ending with consensus that the country needs to guarantee 
public access to free, quality pharmaceuticals.  The Minister 
of Health opened the conference, which brought together 
academics, bureaucrats and business representatives to propose 
recommendations to be incorporated in the Ministry\'s 
pharmaceutical policy. One of the conference resolutions 
suggested revision of Brazil\'s patent law to allow for local 
production or importation of expensive medicines in cases of 
\"relevant social interest.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
15.  (SBU) While we cannot guess at the outcome of the current 
price negotiations, we do judge that the GoB will not let 
Brazilian HIV/AIDS patients go without these vital medicines, 
nor will it be willing to divert significant additional 
budgetary resources to meet increasing demand for the latest 
generation of drugs.  The global adulation of the GoB\'s AIDS 
program, plus the emergency status that the WTO has conferred 
upon the AIDS epidemic, make it likely that the GoB will employ 
compulsory licensing to assure the supply of AIDS drugs unless 
the desired price reductions are negotiated. Importation of 
knock-offs would likely be a temporary measure until the state- 
owned lab can begin internal production.  Whether Brazil can 
actually startup production of these pharmaceuticals as cheaply 
as Brazilian officials seemingly assume is not a foregone 
conclusion.    END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  BRAZIL:  NO POST-CANCUN REGRETS OR SECOND THOUGHTS 
 
REFS: (A) Brasilia 3089, (B) Brasilia 3070 (C) Brasilia 2233 
 
1. (U) All public and official signs are that the GoB still 
feels solid self-satisfaction over its performance at Cancun. 
It displays zero compunction over Cancun\'s collapse or the 
possible damage to the WTO\'s future, while reaffirming that 
the WTO remains the planet\'s indispensable multi-lateral 
trade-policy forum.  This general sentiment seems to reign 
across the spectrum of Brazilian opinion, aside from a few 
muted worries or warnings by independent commentators.  The 
common if vague Brazilian sense is that the G-21\'s actions 
constituted an overdue, laudably successful demand to be 
taken seriously, and that any adverse reaction by the U.S. or 
EU simply demonstrates that the rich-country club is loath to 
accept developing countries\' standing up to defend their 
rights. 
 
2. (U) USTR Zoellick\'s September 22 Financial Times opinion 
column (\"America will not wait for the won\'t-do countries\") 
unquestionably hit a sensitive spot.  It was published the 
next day in Portuguese translation by top circulation daily 
`Folha de Sao Paulo,\' and no-one in the GoB pretended to 
doubt that USTR\'s criticisms were aimed squarely at Brazil. 
However, those criticisms from abroad have had no evident 
effect in swaying Brazilian opinion. 
 
3. (U) If anything, official reaction to the column has just 
further tightened the GoB\'s rhetorical ranks.  Finance 
Minister Palocci: \"Brazil has been characterized in this 
episode and in others by a clear will to negotiate. There is 
no reason to doubt the decision, the will, and the potential 
of Brazil and its partners in the negotiations.\"  Agriculture 
Minister Rodrigues: \"Zoellick\'s statement was a mistake.\" 
Development Minister Furlan: \"Brazil is simply putting its 
interest on the table, knowing that a negotiation means give 
and take.\"  Less restrainedly on the non-government side, 
Folha columnist Clovis Rossi summed up that \"Zoellick\'s op-ed 
is an open declaration of war on Brazil, with the explicit 
threat of leaving the country behind in trade negotiations.\" 
 
4. (U) Foreign Minister Amorim himself, in an official 
release, responded unrepentantly to the USTR op-ed, inter 
alia by saying that \"Having maintained a constructive 
position, Brazil does not consider it useful to be involved 
in an exercise of blame over the difficulty of reaching 
consensus in Cancun.\"  See full substantive text of the 
Itamaraty release below at Para 10.  Media have since quoted 
Amorim as asserting that \"(i)f someone changed, it was the 
United States and not Brazil. The position defended by 
Brazil in Cancun coincides 70% to 80% with the earlier U.S. 
position.\" (NOTE:  presumably referring to specific 
agricultural issues such as export-subsidy phase-out.  END 
NOTE.)  President Lula is reported to have publicly echoed 
this assertion on September 25 in New York. 
 
5. (U) The Brazilians continue to declare that Cancun has not 
altered the WTO\'s status as the world\'s legitimate, necessary 
forum for multilateral trade negotiations.  The Itamaraty 
release includes the declaration: \"From Brazil\'s perspective, 
what is most important now is, in accordance with the 
declaration approved in Cancun by the ministers, to promptly 
resume the negotiations in Geneva.\"  FM Amorim repeatedly 
asserted in his September 17 testimony to Brazil\'s Congress 
that resumption of WTO and Doha-Round business as usual may 
at worst suffer a six or twelve-month delay (Ref B). 
 
6. (U) FM Amorim as well as presidential foreign policy 
advisor Marco Aurlio Garcia have also gone out of their way 
to deny that the GoB\'s trade-policy course is a product of 
any \"anti-American\" bias.  Amorim told Brazil\'s Congress 
that \"the relationship between Brazil and the United States 
has never been as good as now,\" and that official and 
unofficial sources confide to him that President Bush \"has 
only made praiseworthy references to Lula.\"  Amorim seemed 
to dismiss the notion that Cancun will have far-reaching 
consequences for trade talks or relations with the U.S., 
saying that occasional criticisms during trade and political 
talks are just \"part of the game.\" (Ref B.) 
 
7. (U) In like vein, top national dailies made much of the 
report that, just one day after USTR\'s criticism of Brazil\'s 
position at Cancun, U.S. Treasury Secretary Snow spoke to 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Palocci in Dubai in complimentary 
tones. \"We spoke about Cancun, and (Snow) made it very clear 
that the U.S. government will continue with its multilateral 
agenda of trade negotiations, and that they have great 
interest in keeping a close cooperation with Brazil,\" 
Palocci was quoted repeatedly. 
 
8. (SBU) There are a few well-informed exceptions to the 
breezy trend.  Aside from the occasional media commentator 
warning that Brazil will be left behind in a future process 
of bilateral trade negotiations, these include Itamaraty U/S 
for WTO Clodoaldo Hugueney.  Over lunch with us on September 
25, Hugueney left no doubt that he felt \"the Doha train had 
been derailed,\" due, in his judgment, to poor preparation 
that had left the WTO leadership badly unaware of the state 
of play over Singapore issues.  Hugueney said he believed 
that, were it not for the abrupt Singapore-issue fiasco, 
Cancun could have produced an agricultural paper \"albeit 
with brackets\" that could have met minimum Doha-Round needs. 
Now, it was hard to see how a way out or forward could be 
found, he opined. 
 
9. (U) In public, the GoB front remains united behind 
Itamaraty, but there is the occasional suggestion of 
dissension in the ranks.  One post-Cancun media article has 
referred to Ministers Furlan, Palocci and Rodrigues lining up 
against Itamaraty over a specific trade-policy issue at a 
recent meeting of the CAMEX.  Supposedly, they rejected 
Itamaraty\'s advocacy that Brazil unilaterally revise its 
schedule for submission of FTAA offers.  It was not plain 
from the article whether the offers in question are ones 
Brazil has already made, on schedule, or ones for the well- 
known areas vis-a-vis which Brazil is already months behind 
the FTAA timetable. 
 
10. (U) Following is the Itamaraty release responding to 
USTR Zoellick\'s September 22 opinion piece in the Financial 
Times. 
 
(Begin text) 
 
In regard to the article published today (.) by the U.S. 
Trade Representative (USTR), about the results of the Fifth 
Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
- in which Brazil is explicitly cited five times - Minister 
Celso Amorim has the following comments to make: 
 
-- each country has the right to present its own evaluation 
of Cancun; 
 
-- Brazil, secure that it maintained a constructive 
position, does not consider it useful to get involved in the 
attribution of guilt over the difficulties in reaching a 
consensus in Cancun; 
 
-- Brazil would rather focus on strengthening the WTO, in 
coordination with trade partners that are interested in the 
liberalization of agricultural trade and in the elimination 
of subsidies, according to the Doha mandate; 
 
-- if the explicit references to Brazil reflect the 
importance that is attributed to our performance in the WTO, 
this criticism, either implicit or explicit, comes in 
contrast with the comments made by the USTR to the head of 
the Brazilian delegation - on the eve of the closing of the 
conference - that the declaration made just hours before in 
the name of the G-20 \"plus\"  had been \"businesslike,\" which 
constituted in and of itself a positive indication; 
 
-- this criticism is also surprising because, until 
recently, the United States shared in large measure the same 
level of ambition expressed by the G-20 \"plus\" in regard to 
the three pillars of agricultural trade reform; 
 
-- from Brazil\'s perspective, what is most important now is, 
in accordance with the declaration approved in Cancun by the 
ministers, to promptly resume the negotiations in Geneva; 
 
-- Brazil will continue to commit itself to building genuine 
consensus leading towards the legitimate aspirations of all 
participants, especially developing countries. 
 
(End Text of Statement) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
11. (SBU) We judge there to be little chance in coming weeks 
of the GoB repenting or reforming its recent Cancun actions 
and current trade-policy attitude.  Ill-advised and 
ultimately damaging to Brazil itself though they may prove, 
those actions and attitude have not been a matter of caprice. 
They have evolved consistently from the stew of GoB 
priorities and considerations -- political, social, 
developmental as well as \"just\" commercial -- which we tried 
to describe in detail last July in Ref C, and recently 
updated in Ref A.  Politically, Lula, FM Amorim and Congress 
alike for now perceive this as a sure domestic and 
international winner. 
 
12. (SBU) We credit the GoB with believing its own rhetoric 
that it will be better to delay than to accept a \"bad\" deal, 
i.e., one insufficiently attentive to their demands. 
Implicit in its position is the assumption that trade talks 
cannot move forward without Brazil, that, in effect, the 
latter has a kind of veto on real progress.  One positive 
aspect to underline is that, despite what we do see as tinges 
of 1970s ideological antipathy amongst the professional 
castes of Itamaraty, GoB actions are not/not being propelled 
by anti-U.S. antagonism.  On the contrary:  the GoB is 
unrealistically counting on being able to both have its cake 
and eat it -- to stand up to the rich nations with developing- 
country demands, while paying little or no price in terms 
either of the WTO\'s future effectiveness or of overall 
bilateral relations with the U.S.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL VICE PRESIDENT JOSE ALENCAR\'S PROBLEMATIC 
PERFORMANCE 
 
REF: A. A. BRASILIA 3125 
     B. B. BRASILIA 02473 
 
1.    (SBU)  Summary.  Unlike in the U.S., Brazil\'s Vice 
President assumes control when the chief executive travels 
abroad.  Current VP Jose Alencar usually keeps a low profile 
in that capacity, but his underwhelming performance during 
President Lula da Silva\'s recent trip to New York to open the 
UNGA has raised questions about Alencar\'s suitability for the 
number two executive branch job.  End Summary. 
 
Alencar\'s Signature Moment 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU)  During Brazilian President Lula\'s recent 
international travel, Vice President Jose Alencar\'s 
procrastination in signing a controversial decree legalizing 
the planting and sales of genetically-modified soybeans 
generated considerable media attention (ref A). A few 
commentators allowed that the President should not have left 
Alencar holding the bag on such a contentious issue, but the 
incident nonetheless raised doubts about Alencar\'s 
capabilities.  Alencar had been relatively quiet over the 
last few months after he stirred debate in June by 
criticizing publicly the Central Bank\'s interest rate 
policies.  Unlike the interest rate flap, however, few 
believe that Alencar\'s recent wobbling on biotech soybeans 
was a gambit to allow the GoB to air opposing views (as a 
business contact asserted to Sao Paulo ConGen recently) or 
legitimate commentary within Alencar\'s area of expertise. 
Indeed, during a meeting on GMOs with a U.S. Codel, Alencar 
appeared uninformed about the issue (ref B). 
 
3. (SBU) The opposition is also making some political hay out 
of Alencar\'s performance.   The 1988 Brazilian Constitution 
directs the Vice President to assume the duties of chief 
executive when the President travels abroad.  According to 
press reports, PDT Senator Jefferson Peres has used Alencar\'s 
GMO stutter-step to reinvigorate a push for an amendment that 
would modify the VP\'s powers.  (Note. It is unlikely that 
Peres can muster the 3/5 majority needed to pass an amendment 
as the administration is opposed to the proposal. End note.) 
 
Views of a Predecessor 
---------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) In the wake of the June interest rate flap, 
President Cardoso\'s (1994-2002) Vice President Marco Marciel, 
a Senator from Pernambuco, told Poloff that occasional 
contretemps between the VP and the President are predictable 
but manageable. Maciel, who served 339 days as Acting 
President, noted that the running mate is often selected to 
provide geographic or ideological (i.e. party) balance, which 
can lead to policy disconnects.  The discreet Maciel got 
along well with President Cardoso, but the VP-President 
relationship has often been rocky in Brazilian history.  In 
the case of Alencar, Maciel asserted that a relative lack of 
political experience undermines his  performance.  After a 
very successful career as a clothing exporter, Alencar 
entered politics with an unsuccessful 1994 gubernatorial bid 
in Minas Gerais before serving one senate term.  Maciel said 
Alencar\'s inexperience also makes it harder to craft a 
suitable \"special mission\" for him as provided by the 
Constitution. 
 
5. (SBU) Maciel does not believe that efforts to reform the 
vice presidency would make much progress unless tied to a 
much larger political reform package.  He noted that most 
Brazilian politicians believe that the inordinate number of 
times a Vice President has come to power in Brazil in the 
last 50 years (four, not counting the several temporary 
assumptions of the Presidency due to health reasons during 
the 21-year military regime) necessitates having an elected 
Vice President who is given some opportunity to serve as the 
number one. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) Alencar will have ample opportunity to improve his 
performance as Acting President. If Lula maintains his 
current pace of foreign travel, the 72 year-old Alencar could 
wear the presidential sash for over 200 days this term. 
While Alencar has managed to become part of the story in two 
controversial domestic issues, he has not abused his 
authority.  At the end of the day, he signed the soybean 
decree as the President instructed.  Moreover, the Vice 
President has not been a factor in other hot button issues, 
such as tax and pension reforms, suggesting any future 
intrusions onto center-stage will be accidental.  Alencar\'s 
most important contribution continues to be as an 
intermediary between the business community and the Workers\' 
Party-dominated administration.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S CAPTOR FIRST TO BOLT PT PARTY 
 
REF: A. BRASILIA 3125 
     B. BRASILIA 2655 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Fernando Gabeira, a Brazilian Federal 
Deputy whose original claim to fame was as a revolutionary 
who kidnapped the US Ambassador in 1969, has become the first 
national figure to leave Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) of his 
own volition since Lula took office.  Over the years, Gabeira 
has been an outspoken environmentalist, and his break with 
the PT was triggered by Lula\'s recent decision to legalize 
genetically-modified soybeans (ref A).  Gabeira\'s departure, 
along with the likelihood that three other Deputies will be 
expelled from the party for voting against a key reform bill, 
illustrates how the Workers\' Party has changed in recent 
months and years.  Policy decisions, even on bedrock 
substantive issues, are no longer made after discussion and 
consensus-building within the party.  Instead, the Lula 
government is making decisions animated by the practical 
necessities of leading a country and a fractious coalition. 
These compromises are at odds with some of the PT\'s 
traditional positions and are unpalatable to many of the more 
determined leftists in the party, though no others seem 
inclined to leave the PT at present.  END SUMMARY. 
 
WHAT\'S UP, COMRADE? 
------------------- 
2. (U) Fernando Gabeira was a journalist who joined a small 
Brazilian revolutionary group called MR-8 that gained 
notoriety in 1969 when it kidnapped U.S. Ambassador to Brazil 
Charles Elbrick.  The events were brought back to life in the 
1997 movie \"Four Days in September\" --based on Gabeira\'s 
novel about the kidnapping, \"O Que E Isso, Companheiro?\" 
(\"What\'s Up, Comrade?\").  Elbrick was freed in exchange for 
the Brazilian regime releasing fifteen political prisoners 
and sending them into exile.  Among the fifteen was Jose 
Dirceu, a Sao Paulo student leader who returned from exile in 
1979 and co-founded the PT party with Lula the next year. 
Dirceu is now President Lula\'s Chief of Staff and 
most-trusted advisor. 
 
3. (SBU) Gabeira was shot and captured during the Elbrick 
kidnapping, but himself was later freed and sent into exile 
in exchange for the release of the kidnapped German 
ambassador.  Like Dirceu, he returned to Brazil with the 1979 
amnesty.  In addition to his journalism, Gabeira became 
active in human rights and environmental causes, co-founding 
the Green Party (PV) in 1986.  In 1994, he became the Green 
Party\'s first Federal Deputy, winning a seat from Rio de 
Janeiro.  He moved to the PT party in 2001 and was reelected 
to his third four-year term in 2002.  Gabeira, now 62, serves 
on three Chamber committees:  Environment, Human Rights, and 
the Ad Hoc Committee on FTAA negotiations.  He is active in 
debates on biotechnology and free trade, being an outspoken 
skeptic of both. 
 
BIOTECH SOY CAUSES PT\'S FIRST DEFECTION 
--------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) The PT is one of the few Brazilian political parties 
that requires some discipline of its members and frowns on 
party-switching.  There have been 140 party changes in the 
Chamber in the past nine months, none involving the PT.  Thus 
it is significant when a PT member decides to leave the party 
over a point of principle.  Three Deputies are nearly certain 
to be expelled from the Workers\' Party in November for voting 
against Lula\'s pension reform bill (ref B), and Gabeira\'s 
departure comes against the soul-searching engendered by that 
mini-crisis.  But Gabeira is seen as a respected voice who 
has earned his leftist stripes through the years.  In the 
words of one columnist, \"Fernando Gabeira can\'t be accused of 
being a radical, furious, a political opportunist, nutty, 
undervalued, or hysterical\" like some of the other PT rebels. 
 
5. (SBU) Gabeira announced his intention to leave the PT on 
October 6, charging that Lula was no longer listening to the 
rank-and-file on key issues.  He was incensed by the recent 
issuance of a presidential decree legalizing the upcoming 
crop of biotech soybeans (ref A).  Many in the PT\'s 
environmental factions, including Environment Minister Marina 
Silva, were deeply troubled by the decree, and in particular 
by the fact that Lula made the decision without consulting 
the party.  Historically, the PT developed policy positions 
through long debates at party congresses.  In interviews, 
Gabeira also complained that Lula recently met with Castro in 
Cuba without denouncing his human rights record. 
 
6. (SBU) Last week, the PT scrambled to try to keep Gabeira 
in the party and there were rumors that he alone would be 
allowed to vote against the Biotechnology bill when it comes 
to the floor.  Jose Dirceu invited him to an October 10 
meeting at the presidential palace to be joined by Marina 
Silva and party president Jose Genoino.  But Dirceu was an 
hour late to the meeting )-trapped in Congress mediating a 
coalition dispute-- and a clearly-deflated Gabeira walked out 
before Dirceu arrived, grumbling to the press about Dirceu\'s 
\"inelegance\".  Gabeira told the press that he will continue 
to vote for Lula\'s initiatives when he can, but will remain 
\"without party\" for the time being.  It seems likely that he 
will eventually rejoin the Green Party and its six Federal 
Deputies, as long as the Greens do not vote to legalize 
biotech crops. 
 
COMMENT - \"PT PRAGMATIC\" 
------------------------ 
7. (SBU) If Lula has evolved from the old fire-breathing 
union leader into \"Lula Lite\", then the Workers\' Party has 
similarly evolved into \"PT Pragmatic\".  In his first few 
months in office, Lula established a dozen \"councils\" 
designed to forge consensus in nearly every policy sphere. 
But the councils seem nearly forgotten now.  Increasingly, 
decisions are made by a small group including Lula, Dirceu, 
Finance Minister Palocci, and a handful of other PT insiders. 
 The resulting policies --from fiscal austerity at the 
expense of social programs to pension reform to legalizing 
biotech soybeans-- are pragmatic and centrist, but are often 
sharply at odds with historical positions of the Workers\' 
Party.  Both the policies and the policy-making style are 
alienating to the party\'s leftists, who charge the 
administration with \"incoherence\", a Brazilian term roughly 
meaning \"lack of continuity\", suggesting Lula has turned his 
back on both his constituents and his past.  In the wake of 
Gabeira\'s decision, even PT President Genoino, a moderate and 
a Lula insider, is calling for a review of the 
administration\'s decision-making style.  \"The government\", he 
says, \"needs to be more sensitive.  The party has a tradition 
and an agenda.  It has historical banners that can\'t be 
forgotten\". 
 
8. (SBU) With Gabeira\'s departure and the expulsion of the 
three rebels, the PT\'s Chamber caucus will slip to 90 members 
--it will remain the largest party in the Chamber by fifteen 
seats.  In truth, those leaving the PT will move to parties 
farther on the left that are firmly in the PT-led coalition, 
so while they will be free to vote against the administration 
on any given bill, they will not really damage the 
government\'s already fractious coalition.  Instead, the 
departures serve to underline the distance that the PT has 
traveled towards the center over the past year.  This is an 
evolution of choice, Lula and Dirceu and the inner circle 
have made the conscious decision to jettison some of their 
leftist ideology in the name of governability.

SUBJECT: GOB TAKES STEPS TO REDEFINE REGULATORS, STATUS 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:   A GoB draft bill aims to better demarcate 
the powers and responsibilities of Brazil,s nine federal 
regulatory agencies.  The most material change would shift 
authority for awarding and monitoring concessions from the 
agencies to the corresponding GoB Ministries.  The bill,s 
main thrust could be described as reinforcement of the 
social-oversight dimension of regulators, performance.  Some 
regulatory contacts privately assert that the draft in its 
current outline would cripple their agencies, function, but 
we have also heard tentatively favorable first assessments, 
some of the most positive being from industry observers.  The 
public-consultation phase has ended, and the proposed 
legislation will soon be ready for Brazilian congressional 
consideration. END SUMMARY. 
 
THE BILL,S NUTS AND BOLTS 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The GoB published proposed legislation to delineate 
the powers of Brazil,s federal regulatory agencies September 
22.  Those affected comprise the nine federal entities 
regulating energy, petroleum, telecommunications, land and 
sea transportation, sanitation, supplemental health, water, 
and the film industry.  The most sweeping and contentious 
proposed change is the bill,s shift of the responsibility 
for auctioning or awarding concessions, for the subsequent 
monitoring of awarded contracts, and for licensing, from the 
regulators to the corresponding ministries.  (The ministries 
can delegate those functions back to the agencies, however.) 
The draft bill also requires all new contracts to be reviewed 
by the Ministry of Planning.  Public consultations consisting 
of internet and written feedback with a time deadline and 
optional public meetings or congressional hearings prior to 
publication would be mandated for every new regulation.  Each 
agency will also be required to submit an annual report to 
its respective ministry, the Finance Ministry, and the 
Ministry of Planning. 
 
3.  (U) Under the new bill, the President of Brazil would 
appoint an ombudsman (\"ouvidor\") for two-year terms to 
oversee each agency.  Some agencies already have ombudsmen, 
including the two largest, National Electrical Energy Agency 
(ANEEL) and National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL).  The 
agencies, presidents\' and directors\' terms would be reduced 
from the current five to four years, and these officials 
would each have management contracts with respective 
ministries reviewed annually.  Some surmise these contracts 
would have dismissal consequences if goals are not met. 
Every agency is also mandated to form an alliance with a 
government-sponsored consumer watch institute to monitor 
competition within the industry.  There is to be greater 
coordination between the state and federal regulators.  The 
National Water Agency (ANA) would assume responsibility over 
sanitation regulation, and the audio-visual sector will be 
added to the portfolio of the National Film Agency (ACINE). 
 
ANATEL PRESIDENT SPEAKS TO CHAMBER 
---------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) At an October 1 public hearing set by the Science and 
Technology Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, National 
Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL) President Luiz Schymura 
outlined the precepts of the proposed bill.  Embassy 
personnel in attendance noted that Schymura limited himself 
to the bare facts of the bill, explaining he would not reveal 
any personal opinions since the proposal is before the public 
for comment.  Admitting that the proposal transforms the 
General Telecommunications Law that created his agency in 
June 1996, he said ANATEL was equally prepared to work under 
the current laws or the new framework. 
 
THE SPECTRUM OF OPINIONS IN THE PRESS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Early reaction from legislators, regulators, and the 
public has run the gamut from praise to attack.  Congressman 
Paulo Bernardo, member of President Lula,s Worker,s Party 
(PT) from the prosperous southern state of Santa Catarina, 
considers the proposal a more democratic way of distributing 
authority.  Conversely, Congressman Alberto Goldman, a member 
of former President Cardoso,s Brazilian Social Democrat 
Party (PSDB), said the draft represents a retrogression by 
aiming to strip agencies of their licensing authority.  In 
his opinion, if the licensing reverts to Ministries, 
prerogative, it will fall prey to political pressures. 
 
6.  (U) In like vein, ANEEL,S Director General Jose Mario 
Abdo has been quoted as saying that the bill,s proposed 
management contracts would obliterate the independence of the 
Agencies. He also believes that reducing the directors\' 
mandates from five to four years diminishes their autonomy. 
On the other hand, the National Petroleum Agency\'s (ANP) 
Director General Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told  Folha de 
Sao Paulo, September 24, \"The autonomy of the agencies is 
not going to be reduced with this government project.  The 
government has signaled that this is not their intention.\" 
 
7.  (U) Independent commentators, views likewise vary 
widely.  The Brazilian Institute for Consumer Defense (IDEC) 
applauded the proposed changes.  The IDEC,s studies showed 
that consumers have been dissatisfied with the performance of 
the principal agencies and believe changes to be imperative. 
But one of the harshest critics with regard to the switch 
over of authority to auction concessions is Attorney Adriano 
Pires, Director of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, a 
Rio think-tank.  Pires points out that Minister of Mines and 
Energy Dilma Rousseff is the ex-officio president of the 
administrative council for Eletrobras and Petrobras (Brazil\'s 
state-owned energy and petroleum companies).  As such, Pires 
notes, \"The minister will be responsible for concessions and 
also advising the companies that could participate in the 
process.  There is a conflict.  If it isn\'t illegal, it\'s 
immoral.\" 
 
IMPACT VARIES BY AGENCY 
----------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Emboff met with National Agency of Water 
Transportation (ANTAQ) Director General Carlos Nobrega 
October 7.  ANTAQ is one of Brazil,s newest regulatory 
agencies, created September 4, 2001.  Nobrega said the 
potential changes would not affect his agency at all.  ANTAQ 
already has an ombudsman, has not ever been involved in 
awarding any concessions, and ANTAQ,s directors\' current 
terms are already four years. 
 
9.  (SBU) Emboff also questioned Brasilia contacts at ANEEL 
and ANATEL.  ANEEL\'S Assistant Director Gilma Rocha echoed 
her Director General\'s sentiment that the provisions of the 
draft bill would end her agency\'s independence of action. 
She expressed particular concern with the potential loss of 
control of the energy-sector,s bidding and licensing 
process.  The likelihood of fair competition would vanish 
with the state both owning a bidding entity (Eletrobras) and 
awarding the license, according to her.  At ANATEL, 
regulatory attorney Marcelo Amorelli commented that his 
agency would be less affected than ANEEL, since the 
telecommunications industry is already privatized, thereby 
precluding conflict-of-interest hazards that could beset 
ANEEL, which regulates private and public companies. 
Amorelli,s primary concern is that the agency will lose 
focus on the public interest and concede to political whims. 
 
PRIVATE-SECTOR PERSPECTIVE 
-------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) Nortel Director Herva Adam judges that ANATEL has 
become increasingly political as it is.  He opined to Emboff 
at a recent breakfast meeting that ANATEL and the other 
agencies have been on the defensive from the inception of the 
Lula administration, and that the latter,s election was a 
precursor to the end of regulatory independence under the new 
legislation.  Herva predicted that Brazil would be less 
attractive to investors as a result. 
 
11. (SBU)  Far from all private-sector interests share 
Herva,s apocalyptic view.  In a meeting with Sao Paulo 
Econoff, BCP Government Relations Manager Jose Carlos Meira 
Mattos praised the new draft legislation, asserting that it 
would introduce more democracy to the regulatory model for 
telecommunications and bring an end to the \"ANATEL 
dictatorship.\"  Mattos saw hardly any negative aspects to the 
new proposed legislation, admitting only that the GoB,s 
proposed changes would slow decision-making due to the 
increased bureaucracy involved.  (Comment: BCP had a 
combative relationship with ANATEL.  Mattos has claimed that 
ANATEL made unilateral policy decisions that severely damaged 
BCP,s business, specifically with regard to interconnection 
fees.  End Comment.) 
 
12.  (SBU) Enron South America,s CEO, Orlando Gonzalez, 
holds similar rosy views of the new draft legislation.  In a 
September 30 meeting with Sao Paulo Econoff, Gonzalez praised 
the draft bills, asserting that they would better establish 
the division of power between the government and the 
regulators.  In his view, the new system corrects the 
imbalance that resulted from the decision-making vacuum 
supposedly created during the Cardoso administration when, as 
widely asserted by actors in the telecomm and energy sectors, 
the absence of clear and long-term public policies led ANATEL 
and ANEEL, in particular, to exercise a policy-making role 
that belongs properly in the legislative and executive 
branches.  Also, unlike some other private-sector opinions we 
have heard (e.g. from the AMCHAM Regulatory Agency Task Force 
and analysts at Tendencias Consulatoria), which view the 
draft bill,s proposed management contracts as a particularly 
negative aspect, both Mattos and Gonzalez favored this 
requirement.  Neither felt that such contracts would 
automatically politicize the actions of directors; rather, 
both opined that such contracts are essential to ensure 
accountability on the part of agency directors. 
 
13. (SBU) Despite the generally favorable reactions of Sao 
Paulo Econoff,s interlocutors, some aspects of the new 
proposals did cause worry.  Gesner Oliveira of Tendencias 
Consulatoria felt the reform zeroes in on the right problems, 
but proposes the wrong solutions.  He was especially critical 
of the creation of monitoring and evaluation commissions 
directly subordinated to the GoB, seeing it as a mechanism 
for government intervention in agency decision-making 
processes.  Oliveira also expressed concern about the 
ombudsman.  He described the figure as \"the executive branch 
in ombudsman clothes,\" alleging that its presence will 
restrict the agencies, liberty to \"speak freely.\"  Probably 
the major concern for private-sector interests is the 
proposed transfer of authority over concessions to the 
ministries.  Regina Maria do Valle, a lawyer specializing in 
the field of telecommunications, sees this as one of the 
gravest errors in the new legislation.  She noted that in the 
case of ANATEL, this change would give the Ministry authority 
over the disposition of the GoB,s Universalization of 
Telecommunications Fund (FUST) at the very time that the FUST 
is due to receive a further 2 billion Real (USD 700 million) 
infusion. 
 
JURY REMAINS OUT 
---------------- 
 
14.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Some of Brazil,s still fledgling 
regulatory entities have acquired plenty of detractors, from 
foreign energy and telecomm investors right up to president 
Lula.  In particular, ANEEL and ANATEL have been accused of 
having crept into a policy-making role.  Hence the new GoB,s 
move to adjust and more exactly define their status, which 
some in turn characterize as an over-correction.  Building a 
partition between regulatory responsibilities and 
policy-making powers is a needed goal.  Striving for more 
open accountability of regulators also seems legitimate in 
theory.  The most troublesome point of the GoB,s proposed 
changes is the potential conflict-of-interest involved in 
devolving authority for licenses and concessions back to 
Ministries, with all the political interference or 
opportunities for corruption that might entail.

TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) 
SUBJECT: CAN ITAMARATY\'S STRANGLEHOLD ON FTAA POLICY BE 
BROKEN? 
 
 
Classified By: Janice Fair, Economic Officer, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. Summary.  Widespread reporting in Brazil on the outcome of 
the FTAA TNC meeting in Trinidad & Tobago (T&T) unleashed a 
hail of criticism directed at Itamaraty, both on the 
substance of its FTAA policy and its conduct in T&T.  By the 
end of the TNC meeting, Brazilian dailies were reporting that 
Brazil, along with Argentina, were isolated re their 
insistence on a draft FTAA Ministerial Declaration based 
along the line of Mercosul\'s 3-track proposal.  Brazil\'s 
struggle during the TNC to keep Uruguay and Paraguay in the 
Mercosul fold was viewed as particularly damaging.  Minister 
of Agiculture Rodrigues and Minister of Development Furlan 
joined  the fray publicly charging that Itamaraty had not 
vetted the proposal it made in T&T with CAMEX, Brazil\'s 
high-level trade decision-making body, and claiming that 
Itamaraty intransigence is threatening the FTAA.  President 
Lula convened a lunch meeting with Ministers on October 8 in 
which he ordered Ministers to cease and desist the public 
squabble.  Chief of Staff Dirceu stated publicly that 
President Lula will more actively follow the negotiations and 
that the proposal presented in Trinidad and Tobago was \"not 
the last word.\"   Post held meetings with President Lula\'s 
Chief of Staff, and interlocutors in the Agriculture and 
Finance Ministries to explore possible implications of the 
internal dissent on the government\'s FTAA policy.  Despite 
widespread frustration with Itamaraty\'s direction and 
stranglehold on FTAA policymaking, it is unlikely that a 
sufficient challenge will be mounted that could change GOB 
policy before the FTAA Ministerial in Miami at the end of 
November.  End Summary. 
 
Casa Civil 
------------ 
 
2. Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu conveyed to Ambassador during a 
lunch meeting on October 10 that President Lula wants an FTAA 
agreement and that Lula had instructed Foreign Minister 
Amorim to work with USTR Zoellick to that end when (if) they 
meet in late October.  Dirceu commented that Minister 
Amorim\'s position within the government is very strong given 
Itamaraty\'s foreign policy successes over the past six 
months, but also stressed that President Lula sets policy and 
Itamaraty is charged with carrying it out.  Dirceu said that 
he personally would be following the FTAA negotiations more 
closely, and planned to speak directly with Ministers 
Rodrigues and Furlan to better understand  their concerns. 
On substance, he asked how the USG could expect Brazil to 
include sensitive issues such as IPR, services, investment 
and government procurement in the negotiations when it will 
not discuss agriculture.  Ambassador noted that domestic 
support is only one aspect of agriculture and that we are 
actively negotiating a variety of agricultural issues, 
including market access.  Dirceu expressed skepticism that 
the US would be very forthcoming in an election year. 
 
Agriculture Ministry 
------------------------ 
 
3. On October 8, econoff met with Paulo Venturelli, the 
Agriculture Ministry\'s representative at the Trinidad & 
Tobago TNC meeting and General Coordinator of the Agriculture 
Policy Secretariat in the Department of Agricultural Economy 
to explore AGMIN views following the TNC, and to gain a 
better understanding of AGMIN\'s position following Minister 
Rodrigues\' public criticism of Itamaraty.  In a conversation 
with econoff in T&T, Venturelli had commented that the 
Itamaraty negotiators were \"paranoid;\" he was no less frank 
in the October 8 meeting, claiming that Itamaraty has been 
lying to President Lula regarding the FTAA.  Clearly 
frustrated, Venturelli asserted that Itamaraty does not want 
to negotiate in any forum, FTAA or WTO, noting the collapse 
of talks in Cancun. 
 
4. Venturelli said that top level officials of Itamaraty are 
formulating policy based totally of 1960\'s North-South 
ideology and without real economic consideration.  Continuing 
to vent, he claimed that agriculture was not the central 
concern underlying Itamaraty trade policy, but rather was 
being used to shield their real interest, which is to avoid 
negotiation of rules in services, investment, IPR and 
government procurement.  As if the substance of the position 
is not bad enough, Venturelli complained that Itamaraty had 
not vetted the Mercosul proposal for a ministerial 
declaration presented in T&T with any of the other 
Ministries. 
 
5. On domestic support, he said AGMIN understands the US 
position and wants to approach the issue from the standpoint 
of addressing the effects of domestic support within the 
hemisphere; according to him, it is not necessary to 
negotiate disciplines in the FTAA.  He said AGMIN had 
developed some proposals along this line, but Itamaraty has 
not tabled them.  He also said AGMIN doesn\'t have a problem 
with the US differentiated offer, which \"represents more or 
less the relative access that exists today.\"  According to 
Venturelli, AGMIN is anxious to work on a more specific 
level, toward negotiation of better access for products of 
particular interest. 
 
6. Venturelli noted that CNA, the National Agriculture 
Confederation, is opposed to Itamaraty\'s approach.  He also 
claimed that Argentina is not staunchly in the Brazil camp. 
According to Venturelli, Argentina had produced a proposal 
for the ministerial declaration that was much \"softer\" than 
the eventual Mercosul proposal presented in T&T, prompting 
Itamaraty Secretary General, Pinheiro Guimaraes, to go to 
Buenos Aires a week and half before T&T.  He also insinuated 
that Argentine Vice Minister Martin Redrado departed from T&T 
early to distance himself from the Brazilian position. 
 
7. On 4 1 negotiations, Venturelli said Amorim continues to 
claim that USTR Zoellick agreed to approach these 
bilaterally.  Venturelli was present during the Mercosul-US 
bilateral in T&T and insists that despite the clear 
communication from the US regarding the need to keep any 
discussion within the FTAA, Itamaraty keeps trying to make it 
into something else. 
 
8. Venturelli was pessimistic about a successful outcome in 
Miami.  He suggested the USG adopt a hardline with the GOB, 
going so far as to tell Brazil to take the FTAA as is, or be 
left behind as the US and the other countries proceed to form 
the FTAA.  His view is that this shock may be necessary 
before the government will admit that Itamaraty\'s policy is a 
failed policy.  (Comment: It is doubtful that Minister 
Rodrigues would agree with this prescription, but its mere 
suggestion illustrates the intensity of frustration currently 
within AGMIN over the GOB\'s FTAA policy.)  Venturelli also 
advised against allowing Itamaraty to define the language of 
the debate.  His example was Itamaraty asserting that \"the 
U.S. won\'t negotiate agriculture.\"  He said that U.S. should 
say it is willing to negotiate everything -- even domestic 
support, his point being that there are many ways to 
negotiate an issue; it doesn\'t have to be through 
disciplines.  He also suggested increasing pressure on 
Argentina. 
 
Finance Ministry 
-------------------- 
 
9. On October 10, Ecouns and Econoff met with Arno Meyer, 
Deputy Secretary for International Affairs in the Finance 
Ministry and the Ministry\'s representative to the T&T TNC 
meeting.  Meyer provided a frank and thoughtful analysis of 
the current state of play in the GOB on the FTAA and 
suggestions of how the USG could strengthen pro-FTAA forces 
within the government.  He explained that while the Finance 
Ministry wants the FTAA because of the economic benefits 
associated with trade liberalization, Itamaraty has 
responsibility for trade policy.  Other Ministries have an 
opportunity to interject their opinions, but he identified 
four perceptions that Itamaraty uses to justify its policy 
and that the other ministers find difficult to challenge. 
Given this, the other ministers have not been able to 
effectively insert their constituency\'s economic interests 
into the policy debate. 
 
10. The four perceptions he identified are: 
1) The U.S. won\'t negotiate agriculture.  Unlike Venturelli\'s 
view, Arno said that agriculture is the key issue for the 
GOB, and the unwillingness of the U.S. to negotiate domestic 
support in the FTAA provides the main justification for 
Itamaraty\'s approach of removing other issues from the 
negotiation.  While he understands the US argument about the 
best forum in which to negotiate disciplines, if there was 
some way that the U.S. could deal with the effects of 
domestic support in the region, Arno said this would 
significantly undercut one of Itamaraty\'s main arguments 
against the US position. 
 
2) The U.S. won\'t negotiate antidumping rules.  He said the 
US is vulnerable when it says \"everything is on the table.\" 
Arno cited Treasury Secretary Snow reiterating this when he 
traveled to Brazil a number of months ago. 
 
3) The U.S. position regarding agricultural 
liberalization/reform has changed as a result of election 
year politics.  Echoing a point Dirceu raised with 
Ambassador, Arno said that Itamaraty has portrayed the 
pre-Cancun joint U.S.-EU agriculture paper as proof the U.S. 
has changed its position and is adopting a more protectionist 
stance.  He said this perception is important in terms of how 
it affects the overall attitude toward the US and any 
analysis of U.S. motives. 
 
4) The U.S. is out to isolate Brazil.  Itamaraty personalizes 
US aggressive trade policy suggesting that US CAFTA 
negotiations and discussions with Colombia, Peru, etc are 
aimed at \"encircling\" Brazil.  Ecouns and econoff argued that 
the US motivation for these trade talks is to pursue trade 
liberalization as quickly as possible with like-minded 
countries that are ready and willing; if Brazil becomes 
isolated it will be the result of its own decisions and trade 
policies, which don\'t coincide with those of a majority of 
countries in the region.  Arno said he understands; he had 
witnessed the isolation in T&T and knows that countries there 
were acting out of their own economic interests, but 
Itamaraty tries to portray it as is they have been forced by 
the US. 
 
11. Arno advised that if DUSTR Allgeier during his meetings 
in Brasilia October 20-21 could provide information/arguments 
to Minister Palocci and others that they could use to 
challenge these perceptions, it would enable them to more 
forcefully make pro-FTAA arguments. 
 
12. Since he had identified agriculture as the GOB\'s key 
issue, we asked Arno whether he thought the GOB would 
withdraw its 3-track proposal if a way around the impasse on 
domestic support was found.  He was unsure, noting that 
Minister Amorim had stated publicly that week that Brazil 
would not accept any agreement that would \"tie our hands\" on 
industrial policy.  He added that the Finance Ministry 
supports negotiation of rules in services and investment 
because Brazil is relatively open in these areas and would 
not have difficulty negotiating a satisfactory agreement. 
The Finance Ministry does not share Itamaraty\'s view that the 
country must safeguard the possibility of adopting 
nationalistic industrial policies in the future.  He also 
noted that the Finance Ministry had been very favorably 
disposed toward USTR Zoellick\'s ideas about a possible 
baseline approach, having common rules and then allowing 
others that want to go beyond doing so through bilaterals or 
plurilaterals. 
 
13. As an aside, he opined that one positive thing to have 
occurred during a tumultuous week of intra-governmental 
squabbling was the rallying of pro-FTAA forces, in the press, 
private sector, academia, and government.  He also said that 
personally he was very disappointed by the way the Brazilian 
delegation conducted itself in T&T and did not understand why 
they did not use it as an opportunity to explain and sell 
their proposal. 
 
Conclusions 
-------------- 
14. Some key points to emerge from these meetings and the 
post T&T public debate: 
 
-- President Lula\'s support for Minister Amorim means that 
Itamaraty will continue to retain a stranglehold on trade 
policy in general, FTAA in particular.   It appears 
increasingly that Amorim may not accurately portray for Lula 
the US position or the situation vis-a-vis lack of regional 
support for the Brazilian position. 
 
-- Itamaraty\'s defensive interest in avoiding disciplines in 
services, investment, government procurement, and IPR, is at 
least as important, if not more so, than its offensive 
interests in agriculture.  This makes it unclear if 
resolution of the impasse over domestic support would induce 
Itamaraty to withdraw its 3-track proposal or its proposal in 
T&T of text for a ministerial declaration.  Lack of any give 
by the USG on negotiating antidumping rules will continue to 
provide Itamaraty with an excuse to push for removal of 
issues it deems sensitive from the FTAA. 
 
-- Criticism of Itamaraty concerning Brazil\'s isolation on 
substance, and most importantly its struggle to keep Uruguay 
and Paraguay Mercosul partners in line, interjected doubt 
about the wisdom of its approach into the policy debate. 
This opened the door for wide ranging criticism from the 
press, economic commentators and even other ministers.  This 
undermines Amorim\'s image as a regional foreign policy leader 
and introduced the idea that Brazil could be acting as a 
spoiler. 
 
-- There is substantial support for an FTAA within the GOB. 
However, despite frustration with Itamaraty over policy 
formulation and implementation, the other ministries are not 
well positioned at this time to force a significant change. 
 
-- There appears to be real concern that there will be a 
train wreck in Miami.  The fact that ministers made this a 
public debate indicates the seriousness with which it is 
being taken and perhaps was intended as a way of drawing 
President Lula\'s attention to the problem. 
 
Comment 
----------- 
 
15. Although the prospect of a change in GOB policy direction 
before the Miami Ministerial is dim, pressure to change 
course may grow afterward as other ministers and as the 
Brazilian private sector come to realize the costs associated 
with Itamaraty\'s minimalist approach to the FTAA, whether it 
is isolation and being left outside an agreement, or possibly 
accepting major reductions in market access for lower level 
commitments on rules.  Whatever construct the USG decides to 
pursue for the negotiations in Miami, it would be wise to 
orchestrate it in a way that amicably leaves the door open 
for greater participation of Brazil in the future; not only 
to enable the USG to continue to strive for the larger goal 
of a totally integrated hemisphere, but also to minimize the 
opportunity for anti-FTAA factions within Brazil to lay the 
blame for \"failure,\" or alienation of Brazil, in Miami at the 
feet of the USG.  A consistent message from other countries 
in the region that their interests do not coincide with 
Brazil\'s will be key to helping with the latter.

SUBJECT:  BRAZIL\'S PROSPECTS FOR A RETURN TO ECONOMIC GROWTH 
 
REFS: A) SAO PAULO 1835 
      B) BRASILIA 3405 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  Brazil\'s government, economists and media all now 
voice expectation of forthcoming relative economic relief. 
Hardly anyone dissents from the forecast of 3/3.5% GDP growth 
in 2004.  Optimists suggest a parallel with 2000, when Brazil\'s 
GDP grew 4.4% after the previous year\'s 0.7%, despite the 
context of a cloudy world economy, as real interest rates fell 
from 9 to 6 percent.  The hopeful scenario today is for one or 
two quarters of upswing to be driven by consumer-credit 
expansion and long-deferred purchases of durable goods in 
response to the GoB\'s monetary easing since July, with the 
premise that this new consumption will induce fresh investment 
that would become Brazil\'s primary economic driver for the 
medium run, in turn spurring extra output, employment and 
consumer buying-power by 2005.  Some unexpectedly good recent 
data for industrial output and capital-goods sales are 
consistent with this picture. 
 
2.  Market confidence in the GoB and in domestic political 
events seems quite sturdy.  Calls for the Central Bank to relax 
monetary policy still faster have come from some surprising new 
quarters.  But the GoB is plainly set on breaking Brazil\'s 
habit of bubble-and-inflationary-bust.  It wants multi-year 
sustainable growth (which coincides with Lula\'s re-election 
interests), and won\'t be rushed.  Investors view the status of 
Lula\'s pension and tax bills, however watered-down, as still 
adequate.  Greater doubt exists as to the GoB\'s future 
microeconomic/regulatory reforms, upon which by general 
agreement vital investment will hinge.  And Brazil\'s debt/GDP 
vulnerability remains on everyone\'s mind.  The main worry is of 
a too-early U.S. monetary tightening.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Consensus on Growth 
------------------- 
3.  This cable reflects recent discussions in forty-plus 
meetings with GoB, market, and think-tank specialists in 
Brasilia, Rio and Sao Paulo during Treasury and EXIM visits. 
Interlocutors were drawn from a half-dozen foreign or 
domestic private banks, the Ministries of Planning, Finance 
and Trade, Treasury, multiple offices of the Central Bank, 
the Banco do Brasil, BNDES, Getulio Vargas Foundation, 
National Confederation of Industry, a major manufacturer, a 
top credit-rating agency, congress\'s tax committee, and 
elsewhere. 
 
4.  Without exception, sources agreed that Brazil\'s economy 
should grow 3% to 3.5% in 2004.  All saw the ongoing drop in 
interest rates (with the benchmark SELIC down since June 
from 26.5% to an expected 18% on November 19) producing a 
marked, steady expansion of credit.  Bradesco chief 
economist Osmar Pinho expected easing credit terms, coupled 
with traditional end-of-year bonuses and negotiated salary 
increases taking effect in January, to spark a near-term 
consumption mini-boom.  Pinho thought a modest 20% increase 
in credit from its current depressed level sufficient to 
achieve the 2004 growth figure.  Longer-term, he expected 
new investment to assume the role of central economic 
driver, pointing to Brazil\'s need for electrical generation 
capacity and ongoing telecom investment projects. 
 
5.  NOTE:  Brazil\'s credit stock totaled Reals 390 billion 
in September -- almost exactly 25% of GDP.  Hence, credit 
expansion of the order specified by Pinho would merely 
involve bringing the ratio back up to 30%.  That would still 
be appreciably below the 32% of early 2002, when Brazil\'s 
economy was already hard-hit by the contractionary effects 
of Argentina\'s collapse, Brazil\'s own energy crisis, and 
9/11.  END NOTE. 
 
6.  CSFB\'s chief economist Rodrigo Azevedo likewise believed 
the monetary stimulus from falling interest rates and 
growing credit would carry the economy through the first two 
quarters of 2004 at a 3% rate.  After that, investment would 
be needed to extend growth.  Azevedo\'s counterpart at Banco 
Pactual, Guilherme Bacha, volunteered the view that the CB 
ought to be lowering interest rates still more aggressively, 
to better pump early consumption.  Bacha (who reportedly was 
offered the post of CB Chairman after Lula\'s election but 
turned it down in the belief that the GoB would accord him 
too little authority to ensure fiscal restraint), 
acknowledged with a grin that monetary loosening was the 
last recipe he would have prescribed in the PT government\'s 
first months, but explained that the GoB has so conclusively 
established its credibility that bolder cuts now would be 
risk-free. 
 
7.  In a related vein, Central Bank (CB) Governor for 
Monetary Policy Bevilacqua noted to us that Brazil has a 
historical record of swift, strong reaction to the early 
stages of monetary easing.  Even with real interest rates 
(10-11%) still high by most standards, Brazilians have begun 
to make new buying decisions based on the CB\'s interest-rate 
cuts since June, averred Bevilacqua.  He was careful to 
state that the CB does not necessarily see the current 10% 
as the economy\'s \"equilibrium\" real-interest rate.  At the 
same time, he offered no hint of how fast or far the SELIC 
might fall in 2004.  Rather, he stressed the GoB\'s unaltered 
resolution to preempt any possible reversion to what he 
termed Brazil\'s past \"go and stop\" pattern:  too-carefree 
monetary easing fuelling good growth for a year or two, only 
to be followed by inflation\'s return and GDP slowdown. 
 
8.  Ministry of Finance Economic Policy Secretary Lisboa 
echoed Bevilacqua\'s thesis that the Brazilian economy reacts 
unusually quickly to interest-rate decreases.  Separately, 
however, the IMF ResRep made plain to us his own disbelief 
that a sustained wave of consumption is on Brazil\'s near 
horizon.  Other specialists note the likelihood that 
Brazil\'s much-increased current tax burden and real-income 
constraints will inhibit renewed spending far more than 
during Brazil\'s past historical episodes of monetary easing. 
 
9.  Nonetheless, some unexpectedly good recent statistics do 
accord with the GoB\'s optimism.  Industrial production this 
September grew nationally by 4.2%, and in Sao Paolo by 5.7%, 
compared to September 2002.  National vehicle sales in 
October were up by double-digit percentages for the second 
month in a row, admittedly helped by a recent GoB tax 
incentive.  Encouragingly for near-term investment 
implications, capital-goods sales and imports were also both 
up strongly, month-on-month.  Retail sales rose slightly in 
October, for the first time in fourteen months.  In what the 
GoB claims as further evidence of overall recovery, October 
tax revenues rose twenty percent over September\'s.  And Sao 
Paulo\'s industrial-sector employment surprised all observers 
by growing 0.5% (7,700 new jobs) in October, the best 
October result since 1994. 
 
10.  All private-sector contacts lavished uniform praise on 
the Lula government\'s macroeconomic policies for restoring 
credibility and bringing Brazil Risk (the spread above U.S. 
treasuries that Brazil must pay to borrow on international 
markets) down from over 24% in October 2002 to its current 
level of under 5.5%.  A few acknowledged that part of this 
effect was simply because expectations for macroeconomic 
policy in a Lula government had started so low. 
 
Main Hazard -- External Interest Rates 
-------------------------------------- 
 
11.  CSFB\'s Azevedo and others warned that Brazil\'s 
financial stabilization has benefited from an unusually 
benign international environment, with developed-country 
interest rates at very low levels.  The flip side of the 
coin is that Brazil\'s debt-service burden (debt/GDP ratio 
still at 57%) leaves it prey to potential tightening of U.S. 
monetary policy.  That could re-ignite last year\'s vicious 
cycle of currency depreciation, causing foreign exchange to 
exit or avoid Brazil anew and upsetting the GOB\'s carefully 
balanced fiscal apple cart.  This risk may loom larger in 
light of the third-quarter U.S. growth figures. 
 
12.  Banco Pactual\'s Bacha was particularly emphatic that 
the main threat to Brazil\'s economic prospects in 2004-2005 
would be a too-early initiation of U.S. Fed interest-rate 
hikes.  Yes, Bacha admitted, such hikes would presumably be 
correlated with strong U.S. growth, which should fuel 
Brazilian exports.  But, he said adamantly, the financial 
downside for Brazil would far outweigh any export-demand 
benefit.  Asked at what stage U.S. interest-rate movement 
might become critical for Brazil, Bacha declined to 
quantify, opining just that world-market atmosphere at the 
time would be decisive. 
 
13.  In this context, minds are focused on the GoB\'s 
reduction of the dollar-indexed component of public debt. 
With the ongoing non-rollover of up to 12 billion dollars\' 
worth of dollar-linked Brazilian domestic debt, that 
component may fall below 23% by year\'s end.  Continuing this 
progress through next year is essential to keeping the 
dollar-linked debt from exerting undue pressure on fiscal 
accounts when the inevitable developed-world monetary 
tightening begins.  As to overall debt-to-GDP ratio, GoB 
officials admitted that it will be marginally greater at the 
end of 2003 than a year earlier, but maintained that from 
2004 it will steadily fall. 
 
Reform Uncertainties 
-------------------- 
 
14.  The double-consensus of public and private sectors is 
that investment must carry growth in the longer term, and 
that that investment will hinge on macroeconomic and 
microeconomic/regulatory reforms.  The question then is how 
quickly Lula\'s structural reforms advance and begin to bear 
fruit. 
 
15.  Given the delays, watering-down and remaining 
uncertainties of Lula\'s macroeconomic reforms -- i.e., the 
tax and pension bills -- we repeatedly asked if the market 
might at some point deem those reforms inadequate and react 
accordingly.  The consistent answer was negative.  Analysts 
explicitly said their companies are comfortable enough with 
the two bills\' status.  They agreed that their legislative 
progress has been underwhelming, and that the fiscal effect 
of each has been diluted to unimpressive dimensions.  Few 
saw the pension-reform bill as doing much more than 
\"stopping the fiscal bleeding.\"  Alvaro Freire of Unibanco 
warned that all such politically sensitive reforms would be 
an iterative process, requiring years and multiple re- 
visits.  But the simple fact that the PT had tackled pension 
and tax reform seriously remained positive and paramount. 
 
16.  One GoB reform to be unconditionally applauded was the 
new bankruptcy law, recently passed and sent to the Senate 
by the lower Chamber.  Unibanco\'s Freire, among others, 
expected the bankruptcy law to have a fairly rapid effect in 
reducing banking spreads, although opinion was split on the 
size of that impact.  On the subject of Brazil\'s regulatory 
and microeconomic framework for future investment (Ref B), 
we heard a perhaps surprising lack of comment.  This applied 
most conspicuously to the future energy model and the reform 
of regulatory agencies\' roles. 
 
Not Too Much of a Good Thing 
---------------------------- 
 
17.  Several interlocutors noted that sustained growth above 4% 
would pose its own risks.  Ministry of Finance International 
Secretary Canuto asserted that there is sufficient slack 
 
SIPDIS 
capacity in the economy to accommodate growth on the order of 
3% to 3.5%.  Beyond that level, bottlenecks and inflation would 
rear their heads.  AmCham Economic Committee head Paulo 
Albuquerque raised a similar caveat.  GOB officials spoke of 
their aim to alleviate some of these constraints by attracting 
private investment in infrastructure through new Public Private 
Partnerships (PPP) projects. 
 
18.  On the external-account side, renewed Brazilian growth 
could be expected to involve a return to current-account 
deficits, as imports rise from their currently depressed levels 
and with Brazil\'s exporters perhaps selling a greater share of 
output to a reviving domestic market.  The standard estimate 
for these deficits, from both private economists and GoB 
specialists, was five-to-six billion dollars for 2004, and six- 
to-eight billion for 2005.  Many observers noted the need for 
extra foreign investment to bridge these gaps. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
19.  To judge from these meetings, local prognoses for 
Brazil\'s economy are more homogeneously positive now than at 
any time in the last two years.  We have our reservations. 
First, even granted that consumption has begun to pick up 
pre-Xmas, it seems debatable that Brazil\'s population has 
the income or savings for sustained buying after six 
successive years of annual real-wage decline.  Second, the 
GoB\'s record to date in Congress has not been such as to 
inspire confidence in early achievement of the follow-on 
\"microeconomic\" reforms which by general account are a pre- 
condition for vital future investment (Septel).  Third, the 
GoB itself, as Finance Minister Palocci is making newly 
clear, sees 2004 as being perhaps its most austere yet for 
discretionary budget expenditures -- no pump-priming likely 
from that quarter.  Fourth, even 3.5% growth in 2004 would 
hardly begin to make up the ground lost in national income 
and employment in 2001-2003, with that period\'s annual 
growth rates of 1.8%, 1.5% and perhaps 0.6%, respectively. 
 
20.  Even in the smoothest scenario, the timeframe for new 
jobs and income to reach the sectors of Brazil\'s population 
that need them most still looks far-off indeed.  It may look 
particularly so to PT party candidates and others planning 
to contest the October 2004 municipal elections.

SUBJECT: MORE DOUBTS ABOUT ENERGY INVESTMENT IN BRAZIL 
 
REF: A. BRASILIA 3405 
     B. BRASILIA 2859 
 
Sensitive but unclassified, please protect accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  A visiting OPIC/private sector 
delegation found scant reassurance about Brazil\'s New Energy 
Model or investing in Brazil\'s energy sector during November 
19 meetings with Brazil\'s energy regulatory agency (ANEEL) 
and the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).  ANEEL\'s 
Superintendent called into doubt whether the GOB\'s energy 
model offered investors any safety.  An MME rep defended the 
policy to the OPIC delegation, but refused to be drawn out on 
specifics.  The ANEEL criticisms and MME\'s failure to deal in 
specifics left the impression of a policy adrift.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Superintendent Cristiano Amaral of the National 
Electrical Energy Agency (ANEEL) opined that Brazil\'s New 
Energy Model (Ref. A) does not give private investors any 
type of security.  Amaral said the public consultation phase, 
which will end within the next two weeks, will not net great 
changes to boost investors\' confidence.  He pointed out that 
80% of generation plants are publicly owned, and the primary 
Brazilian state-owned company Eletrobras will keep the 
\"lion\'s share\" of the capacity.  Amaral added, \"At the 
present time, it is very difficult to say if it is safe to 
invest.  Even construction under some existing concessions of 
hydro-plants have stopped.\"  The market uncertainty is 
discouraging energy sector investment.  Despite this fact, he 
said there will be 3000 megawatts of new generating capacity 
completed this year, equaling 10% of installed capacity.  In 
a telling sign, these are primarily small power plants built 
by private companies to meet their own needs. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Brazil\'s New Energy Model is expected to be 
presented to Congress within the next two weeks, but would 
not take effect until 2005.  Ministry of Mines and Energy 
Executive Secretary Mauricio Tolmasquim told the press 
recently that there would not be enough energy liberated from 
existing contracts to be  directed into the energy pool 
created under the New Energy Model until then.  Amaral has 
reservations about the model, and believes it will 
metamorphose one from allowing Independent Power Producers 
(IPPs) to find markets along side the blended energy pool 
into a single pool/single buyer system.  He expects the lower 
pool prices, driven by the already-amortorized power plants, 
will force IPPs and free consumers to participate in the 
pool.  Amaral hopes that political pressures will transform 
the New Energy Model into a more reasonable law that 
encourages foreign investment and protects IPPs. 
 
4.  (U)  Amaral said that the renewable energy program is a 
bright spot in the sector, since small renewable plants can 
operate outside of the energy pool under the New Energy 
Model.  Renewable energy operations are assessed half of the 
transmission tariffs, and Eletrobras guarantees a minimum 
price.  These incentives are granted for any renewable energy 
plant generating under 30 megawatts.  Currently, 100 wind 
projects have permits under this program. 
 
5.  (U)  Ministry of Mines and Energy Program Director Maria 
Passos, in contrast, claimed energy sector investment is 
still flowing from Spain, Portugal, and France.  Passos said 
that the Lula administration\'s sound macroeconomic policies 
and New Energy Model offer security to foreign investors. 
The model establishes rules, offers consistency in planning, 
and stability in regulation, she said.  When asked to expound 
upon the details of the model, Passos demurred, replying that 
only MME Minister Rousseff and Executive Secretary Tolmasquim 
could talk about specifics.  Moreover, the GOB would not 
provide exchange rate or inflation guarantees under the new 
model, as these are too risky. 
 
6.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  The tone of Amaral\'s criticism of the 
energy model may have been occasioned in part by tensions 
over the GOB\'s efforts to reform the independent regulatory 
agencies (Ref. B).  The substance of his criticism, however, 
is right on the mark.  Moreover, given a chance to defend its 
policy, our GOB interlocutors failed to provide the sort of 
specifics that would reassure potential investors.  Based on 
what we have seen to date, the new energy model appears 
unlikely to attract significant new investment to the crucial 
power sector.

SUBJECT:  BRAZIL:  MORE BUZZING AT BNDES 
 
REF: Brasilia 3701 
 
1.  Brazil\'s National Bank for Economic and Social 
Development (BNDES) remains in media focus, with totally 
divergent forecasts as to the fate of its leftist Lula- 
appointee President, Carlos Lessa.  Lessa last week flaunted 
his lack of remorse over the maverick actions and comments 
which had raised a few market jitters about a possible 
return to GoB intervention in the economy and reportedly 
earned him a Lula reprimand (Reftel).  BNDES Vice-President 
Darc da Costa subsequently joined his boss in aiming public 
verbal darts in particular at Finance Ministry Secretary 
Marcos Lisboa and Treasury chief Joachim Levi. 
 
2.  In recent front-page articles, financial daily `Valor 
Economico\' treated Lessa\'s imminent ouster as a certainty; 
`Estado de Sao Paulo\' asserted that Lessa\'s November 28 
meeting with Finance Minister Palocci had mended fences and 
made his position \"far stronger than a day earlier\"; and 
`Folha de Sao Paulo\' split the difference by warning that 
the Palocci meeting would help but not permanently shore up 
Lessa\'s position.  One guess has Planning Minister Guido 
Mantega conveniently shifting to BNDES, making available a 
ministerial portfolio for political allocation outside the 
PT, perhaps to current Minister of National Integration Ciro 
Gomes, as part of Lula\'s first cabinet overhaul. 
 
3.  Some commentators have excitedly depicted Lessa\'s 
personal fate at BNDES as a proxy for putative intra-GoB 
policy battles.  As this notion would have it, Lessa is 
catalyzing the protest of the GoB\'s so-called 
\"developmentalists\" and traditional PT ideologues against 
the fiscal hard-line incarnated by Finance Minister Palocci. 
Even those advancing this idea offer no basis for it other 
than speculation and Lessa\'s known attitudes.  Nor do they 
cite any conspicuous GoB figures as being in Lessa\'s corner 
over the issue, aside from one journalist\'s mention -- 
offered with zero evidence -- of Planning Minister Mantega 
and Senator Aloizio Mercadante. 
 
4.  Separately, there are new reports of progress concerning 
GoB steps to give BNDES extra resources.  The long-cited 
goal has been to increase BNDES\'s annual lending capacity 
from the current 35 billion Reals (USD 1 = 2.95 Reals) to 47 
billion in 2004.  The net new capitalization being spoken of 
hovers between five and ten billion Reals.  Various 
specialists claim that BNDES, under Basle capital-ratio 
rules, would be unable to continue major new lending in 2004 
absent a capital influx.  The decision in principle to 
provide such an influx seems unopposed in the GoB.  From 
details of financial-media accounts, however, it is plain 
that the Central Bank is intent on keeping the strictest 
control over the source and mechanism for providing it, as 
well as over guidelines for its future use. 
 
5.  COMMENT.  We judge the hubbub over recent BNDES events 
to be much overblown.  Brazil\'s \"developmentalist\"/fiscal 
hard-liner split itself is just a predictable and natural re- 
run of an old film.  An identical fault-line marked the 
early years of Cardoso\'s first administration.  The 
developmentalists then also included the BNDES head, Luiz 
Carlos Mendonca de Barros, and were spearheaded by Planning 
Minister Jose Serra -- who was utterly eclipsed by Finance 
Minister Malan.  Former-academic Lessa is an order-of- 
magnitude less formidable political actor than was Serra 
then, and, ironically, there seem fewer ministers in Lula\'s 
PT government inclined to identify with Lessa\'s dogmatic 
line than there were in FHC\'s neo-liberal Cabinet ready to 
oppose Malan.  Brazil\'s latest disappointing GDP growth 
statistics, as well as the GoB\'s rising rhetoric about 
launching an industrial policy in 2004, may yet give Lessa 
an extra lease of GoB life as a Lula gesture to the social 
importance of growth and to the PT\'s old-school wing which 
has no other high-profile representation in the GoB.  Either 
way, we see him as zero threat to Palocci\'s position or 
policies.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S EXPANDING TRADE WITH CHINA 
 
REF: BRASILIA 3461 
 
1.  (U)  Summary.  The Lula administration has embarked on a 
determined policy of export expansion in China, seeking to 
build on the boom in this bilateral trade relationship that 
began in 2000.  The Chinese appear to welcome the approach, 
sending at least five trade delegations to Brazil this year 
and demonstrating their confidence with increased investment. 
 Brazil\'s surplus with China has led the latter to seek 
relatively minor reciprocal market opening.  Brazilian 
diplomats and trade officials forecast continued growth in 
trade with China over the long term, rejecting speculation 
that the current boom will be short-lived as Chinese 
production capacity catches up with demand for several key 
products like steel. The Brazilian desire to strengthen ties 
with China in the wake of the WTO Ministerial in Cancun and 
the formation of the G-20( /-) developing country alliance 
contributed to the increase in official visits, and may lead 
to a Lula visit to China next year. There has been 
speculation that China will officially join India, Brazil and 
South Africa to form an expanded G-3.  While strong 
partnerships exist in several areas, trade is the leading 
current attraction in the Sino-Brazilian relationship.  End 
Summary. 
 
The Statistics 
-------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Brazilian press and the Ministry of Development, 
Industry and Foreign Trade have touted the fact that, 
excluding the European Union (Brazilian trade stats list 
European countries individually), China ranks this year as 
Brazil\'s second largest export market, after the U.S.  China 
has advanced from Brazil\'s 12th largest export market to its 
second largest since 2000, and now takes in 6.5 percent of 
Brazil\'s exports. Over the last year, Brazilian exports to 
China more than doubled while imports grew by 7.5 percent. 
Brazil has exported more than $3.9 billion in goods to China 
so far this year compared to $2.1 billion during the same 
period last year.  In comparison, Argentina and Holland 
(third and fourth in export markets) each purchased 
approximately $3.6 billion in Brazilian goods so far in 2003. 
Soy and iron ore account for approximately seventy-five 
percent of exports to China, with soy exports almost doubling 
within the last year.  The top ten list includes laminated or 
semi-manufactured iron and steel, wood products, auto parts 
and motors, soy oil, and animal furs and skins. Statistics 
provided by the Chinese Embassy indicate that Brazil is 
China\'s tenth largest trading partner, accounting for 1.5 
percent of Chinese trade.  While far behind the value of the 
U.S. market to Brazilian exports ($13.9 billion so far this 
year), not to mention the EU ($15 billion so far this year), 
the Chinese market now merits, and is receiving, increased 
attention from the Lula administration. 
 
The Visits 
---------- 
 
3.  (U)  The recent flurry of official visits and 
deliverables with trade objectives underscore the importance 
with which the GoB views this relationship.   Minister of 
Development Industry and Foreign Trade Luis Furlan visited 
Macao in October to take part in the first Forum for Economic 
and Trade Cooperation between China and Lusophone countries. 
Minister of Agriculture Rodrigues followed suit in November 
accompanied by a delegation of Brazilian business leaders. 
Minister of Defense Viegas also made an official visit to 
China in November.  The number of Chinese delegations 
visiting Brazil, especially study missions, has overwhelmed 
the small Foreign Ministry staff dedicated to Asia and 
Oceania, according to one diplomat.  Recent high-level 
Chinese visitors that have made stops in Brazil as part of 
regional visits include Chinese Vice-Minister of Agriculture, 
Fan Xiaojian, who held talks in Brazil in late November, and 
senior Chinese Communist Party official, Zhang Dejiang, along 
with a trade delegation from Guangdong province.  Lower level 
trade and investment missions have participated in trade 
fairs and investigated individual sectors.  The Chinese 
government has also sent a study mission to research Brazil\'s 
social security system.  The strengthening of ties between 
the two countries is also evident in an expanding partnership 
in technology development (see reftel) and space activities. 
 
4.  (U)  Press reports of the trips rarely fail to mention 
the signing of cooperative agreements and the closing of 
trade deals, the significance of which is often difficult to 
determine.  During Rodrigues\' visit in early November the two 
countries signed a phyto-sanitary protocol and agreed to 
reciprocal technical exchanges to iron out difficulties in 
certifying sanitary suitability of a range of agricultural 
products including citrus, chicken, pork, and beef.  Fan 
Xiaojian\'s visit produced an accord establishing rules for 
agricultural marketing and technology transfer, as well as an 
MOU on cooperation in areas ranging from agricultural 
biotechnology to food processing and environmental 
protection.  The trade delegation from Guangdong province 
reportedly closed trade deals in Brazil worth $150 million. 
 
5.  (SBU)  At the Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation in 
Macao, China and eight Portuguese speaking countries signed 
on to an action plan covering joint efforts at trade 
promotion and eliminating trade barriers, exchange of trade 
and investment information, and cooperation in farming and 
fisheries.  Oswaldo Biato, head of the Ministry of Foreign 
Relation\'s office that covers China told Econoff that he 
believes the motivation behind this forum was not closer 
trade ties, but Chinese central government support for Macao, 
which would be the headquarters for the organization which 
may eventually be founded.  Macao\'s economy, he said, is 
dependent on tourism and casinos and needed a special niche 
that was not subject to such variability. 
 
The Potential 
------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  Despite the dubious trade significance of some of 
the recent accords signed between China and Brazil, there is 
little doubt that the GoB sees enormous potential beyond the 
short term.  Biato expects trade to reach $10 billion by 
2006.  China, the world\'s leader in attracting foreign direct 
investment ($50 billion in 2003), one of the fastest-growing 
economies in the world (7% in 2003), and in the second year 
of its 5-year transition toward full WTO compliance, is 
looking for strategic, long-term partners, according to 
Biato.  He maintains that even as China\'s production capacity 
expands for some key imports like soy and steel, the trade 
relationship will continue to be robust, especially to meet 
the needs of a growing middle class.  The pairing is natural, 
as both are developing economic powerhouses in their regions, 
China has excess capital to invest, and Brazil is 
cash-starved.  The Chinese already have small investments in 
the Manaus free-trade zone, including a furniture factory and 
a factory that manufactures televisions.  The Chinese are now 
starting to invest in Brazilian transport projects, including 
port and railway upgrades, investments that are driven by 
existing trade in primary products like soy and iron ore. 
The recent Chinese investment missions focused on 
electronics, pharmaceuticals, steel production facilities, 
thermal electric plants, even fire cracker factories. 
 
7.  (U)  The Chinese market is only just beginning to be 
exploited by the Brazilian private sector, according to 
Brazilian officials.  Trade with China is concentrated among 
40-50 Brazilian firms, many of them multi-nationals. 
Embraer\'s joint venture with Harbin Aircraft Industry Group 
and Hafei Aviation, and Vale do Rio Doce\'s joint venture 
exploration company formed with China\'s Baogang are but two 
of the better known examples of successful bilateral projects 
based on the private sector\'s positive growth calculation of 
bilateral trade.  Export promotion officials have 
criss-crossed the country encouraging small and medium sized 
firms to follow the lead of their larger brethren. The GoB, 
looking to expand exports of manufactured goods to China, has 
contracted a Chinese consulting firm to research the 15 
sectors where Brazil has the best prospects for growth in 
exports to Asia.  Minister Furlan\'s trade mission included 
business representatives from sectors with increasing exports 
to China, including the suppliers of medical equipment, 
aluminum, shoes, meats, and home appliances. 
 
Ag Trade 
-------- 
 
8.  (SBU)  As China\'s population continues to grow wealthier, 
Brazilians see potential for increasing the quantity and 
variety of agricultural exports, including soy, meat, 
chicken, pork, fruit, fruit juice, and coffee.  Brazil\'s 
Commodities and Futures Market exchange soon plans to open an 
office in Shanghai.  Press reports following Agriculture 
Minister Rodrigues\' visit announced that China had certified 
Brazilian beef for import, predicting certification for 
poultry exports soon.  (Note:  Hong Kong is the third largest 
market for Brazilian pork and second largest for chicken 
parts.)   Officials on both sides have overcome earlier 
difficulties with soy shipments regarding identification of 
genetically modified product and the existence of a weed that 
Chinese officials believed to be harmful.  Biato told econoff 
that the Chinese phyto-sanitary problems with Brazilian soy 
mask other concerns regarding food security and 
over-dependence on food imports.  The Chinese government is 
trying to encourage its farmers to grow soy, but is meeting 
resistance, he said. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Biato acknowledged that there was some truth to 
press accounts of Chinese officials demanding reciprocity to 
address China\'s unfavorable trade balance with Brazil.  These 
reports appeared in Brazilian media during Rodrigues\' visit, 
at about the same time as articles claiming that the U.S. was 
pressuring China and Russia to buy more chicken and soy in an 
attempt to reduce Brazilian sales.  Biato said that Chinese 
officials did press for market opening for garlic, corn, 
tripe, apples, lychee and longan fruit.  More significantly, 
he noted, China has requested that Brazil apply market 
economy status to China, thereby limiting the potential for 
dumping cases.  (Note:  Brazil currently has a safeguard in 
effect to protect its toy industry from the onslaught of 
mostly Chinese produced competitors.)  Brazil is considering 
this, as well as a quota for Chinese garlic.  Biato 
underscored the mainly symbolic nature of this reciprocity, 
saying a $2 billion trade deficit with Brazil is 
insignificant for the Chinese. 
 
Political bonds 
--------------- 
 
10.  (SBU)  Despite rumblings that China would soon join the 
India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum (IBSA), sometimes 
called the G-3, Biato denied this, saying that IBSA was still 
in its infancy and needed to focus on concrete bi- and 
tri-lateral projects making use of the geographical realities 
that join the three before branching out.  Biato did not 
speculate about potential difficulties with India should its 
regional rival express a desire to join IBSA.  However, 
Brazil strongly encourages China\'s support for a development 
agenda in other multilateral fora, like the WTO.  According 
to press reports, China supports Brazil\'s bid for a permanent 
seat on the UN Security Council.  Chinese participation in 
the upcoming G-20 meeting in Brazil is expected, and Biato 
confirmed the realistic possibility of a Lula trip to China 
sometime next year. The relationship encompasses many areas 
of cooperation, he said, but trade will be a growing area of 
interest for Brazil. 
 
11.  (SBU)  Comment:  The GoB reserves a special place for 
China in its export promotion efforts, and likewise counts 
China as a partner in advancing its global trade agenda. 
While the money to be made in strong trade links to China is 
not lost on the Brazilians, they also are aware of potential 
pitfalls in opening their own market to the export machine 
that is China, as the toy safeguard demonstrates.  Likewise, 
Brazilian companies know that doing business with and in a 
not-quite-yet market economy has its downside.  Lax 
intellectual property rights protection in China is one 
example of a negative factor for Brazil.  Contraband in 
pirated goods, much of it originating from China, helps to 
fuel organized crime in Brazil and frustrates the efforts of 
the GoB to improve its IPR enforcement.  A September \"Estado 
de Sao Paulo\" article noted the case of Embraco, a Brazilian 
company making compressors that launched a joint venture in 
China to produce for the local market in 1995.  The company\'s 
operations director cited lack of patent protection for the 
company\'s switch from local to foreign suppliers, as their 
competitors could easily buy copies of their designs from the 
local suppliers.  In the quest for export markets and 
building stronger south-south linkages, Brazil appears 
willing to give its developing partners a break on points of 
trade liberalization that do not seriously jeopardize the 
relationship.  While the trade stats continue to point to an 
enriching relationship for Brazil, any bilateral irritants 
are likely to be downplayed.

SUBJECT: G-20 MEET IN BRASILIA 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1.  (U)  Summary.  The G-20 meeting taking place in Brasilia 
December 11-12 is designed to lend political weight to the 
group prior to the December 15 meeting in Geneva in which 
countries will consider restarting WTO Doha Development 
Agenda (DDA) negotiations after the failed Cancun 
Ministerial.  The group is expected to continue to endorse 
the same changes it identified as necessary in Cancun to the 
Derbez text, but with a moderated tone, emphasizing the need 
for flexibility all around.  End Summary 
 
2.  (U)  Representatives of the G-20, a group of developing 
countries that was formed during the Cancun WTO Ministerial, 
are meeting in Brasilia December 11-12.  Brazil\'s Foreign 
Ministry (Itamaraty) has confirmed attendance by 
representatives of the following countries:  South Africa, 
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, China, Cuba, Egypt, Philippines, 
India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, 
Tanzania, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe.  Ecuador is listed as 
sending a \"representative\" (observer) to the meeting. 
Supposedly 14 ministers will be in attendance, but that has 
not been confirmed.  Also attending are WTO Director General 
Supachai Panitchpakdi and EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy. 
Press reports have also asserted that the U.S. was invited. 
 
3.  (SBU)  According to Maria Izabel Vieira, Chief of the 
Agriculture Division in Itamaraty, the G-20 meeting will be 
more political than technical in nature.  She did not 
anticipate presentation of new proposals or ideas, but more a 
reaffirmation of the G-20 commitment to move forward in DDA 
negotiations.  Brazilian press has recently reported on new 
proposals by the G-20 and implied that some would be 
discussed in Brasilia.  Maria Izabel said the ideas being 
discussed are the same as those discussed in Cancun and 
subsequently in Geneva - for instance, the need to change the 
tariff reduction formulas in the Derbez text to \"bring more 
balance\" between developed and developing country 
commitments, and the group\'s interest in setting the limit 
for domestic support to 2.5 percent of production value. 
 
4.  (SBU) The G-20 meetings started Thursday evening and were 
to focus on a discussion of overall strategy for the DDA 
negotiations and preparation for Monday\'s meeting in Geneva. 
In a separate meeting on December 11, the group met with 
Director General Supachai who provided his current assessment 
of the negotiations.  According to press reports today, 
Supachai\'a main message was that all countries need to be 
flexible in all areas, or else no advances will be made in 
Geneva.  In responding through the press, Brazilian WTO 
negotiator, Ambassador Clodoaldo Hugueney, claimed that the 
G-20 is committed to advancing the negotiations and has been 
indicating that it will be flexible as long as the other main 
actors in the negotiation are as well.  Comment: From the 
G-20 perspective, Supachai\'s participation has been an 
invaluable boon to conferring credibility on the group as a 
legitimate negotiating force in the DDA.  End Comment. 
 
5.  (SBU)  In essentially the last working session late 
Friday morning, Lamy will meet with the group for about two 
hours.  The meeting with Lamy appears to be designed to 
demonstrate goodwill by the group with one of its main 
antagonists from Cancun.  According to the EU\'s Commercial 
Attache, Jorge Peydro-Azanar, Lamy had already been planning 
a trip to the Mercosul countries when Brazil\'s Foreign 
Minister Amorim presented the invitation to the G-20 
gathering.  Peydro-Aznar told us Lamy\'s interest in attending 
is to explain the EU\'s perspective on the DDA negotiations, 
as expressed in the November 26 EU Commission Communication 
to the EU Council, and to obtain a better gauge of where the 
group is heading before next week\'s Geneva meeting. 
 
6.   (SBU)  Peydro-Aznar said that Lamy views the G-20 as 
relevant to only a single issue, and would expect the EU to 
approach negotiation of other issues, for instance the 
Singapore issues, with the member countries individually. 
According to Peydro-Aznar, Brazilian press had incorrectly 
claimed Lamy would be presenting a new proposal in Brasilia; 
the \"proposal\" is the idea presented in the November 26 
Communique that the EU could approach the Singapore issues on 
a plurilateral basis, removing them from the 
single-undertaking.  After the G-20 meeting, Lamy will 
continue on to Montevideo where he will participate in the 
Mercosul Summit December 16. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Comment:  Whether a single-issue group or not, the 
GOB will work determinedly to keep the G-20 alive.  It is a 
crucial component of President Lula\'s foreign policy which 
looks to promote Brazilian leadership of developing countries 
to form a counterweight to oft-cited developed-country 
domination.  Regardless of others\' perception that the Cancun 
Ministerial was a disaster, President Lula has unreservedly 
heaped praise on Foreign Minister Amorim for his leadership 
of the G-20, and for demonstrating to the international 
community that developing countries must be dealt with as 
equals.  End Comment.

SUBJECT:  LULA\'S PENSION REFORM PASSES.  WHEN\'S THE NEXT ONE? 
 
REF: (A) BRASILIA 3734, (B) BRASILIA 3684, (C) BRASILIA 3682 
 
1.  After seven-plus months of legislative tussle, Lula\'s 
pension-reform bill passed its required second Senate floor 
vote on December 11 by 51 votes to 24, two votes over the 
minimum 49 (three-fifths) required.  The twelve votes of 
opposition-party PSDB and PFL senators -- spurred by the 
fiscal self-interest of PSDB and PFL state governors -- were 
vital to the GoB\'s success.  Most of its Senate base voted 
obediently, with the predictable exception of a few PT 
radicals due to be expelled from the party this weekend. 
Later on December 11, the GoB\'s tax-reform bill in turn 
passed the first of two required Senate floor votes.  Lula 
is thus almost all the way towards meeting his top declared 
legislative twin goal for his first year in office. 
 
2.  An essential step in the pension-reform process was the 
GoB\'s agreement to introduce a parallel amendment embodying 
features on secondary issues (state-salary sub-ceiling 
levels; benefit and taxation limits on individual pensions, 
et al), arrived at in the latter stages of Senate debate but 
not incorporated into the main bill for reasons of 
procedural expediency.  The bill now awaits just formal 
promulgation in the `Diario do Congresso\' to become law. 
Voting on the parallel amendment by Congress is due to start 
as early as Monday, December 15 but will not be completed 
before 2004. 
 
3.  Though the pension bill has been steadily watered down 
since June, this result remains Brazil\'s broadest pension- 
system reform since the 1988 Constitution.  Former president 
Fernando Enrique Cardoso contrived to introduce changes in 
Brazil\'s private-sector pension (INSS) system, but failed to 
make true inroads in reforming its public-sector pension 
fiscal disaster, whereby some three million retired civil 
servants have drained close to four percent of GDP from the 
GoB\'s Previdencia (Social Security Administration 
equivalent) budget in recent years.  By contrast, Lula\'s 
team took on public-sector-pension vested interests from the 
start, despite the PT\'s historical ties to those interests. 
The espousing and progress of pension reform under Lula\'s 
GoB was one of the latter\'s great confidence-builders for 
\"the market.\" 
 
4.  Main changes introduced by the pension bill as passed: 
 
--  (i) current pensioners or survivors to start 
contributing 11 percent of their benefits above a defined 
floor towards the Previdencia system, starting next March; 
 
-- (ii) future pension ceiling for new public-sector 
employees of 2,400 Reals per month, the same as for private- 
sector social-security recipients (vs. the existing 
\"integrality\" principle that a public-sector pension equals 
top lifetime salary); 
 
--(iii) 30% cut in survivor benefits above 2,400 Reals per 
month, with immediate effect; 
 
-- (iv) public-sector workers already eligible to retire 
under previous rules with pensions equal to full salary will 
be exempted from the existing 11 percent Previdencia 
deduction from their salaries if they continue to work; 
 
--  (v) introduction of the principle of ceilings and sub- 
ceilings on public-sector salaries at all government levels; 
 
-- (vi) lengthening of the minimum requirements for current 
public servants to receive their \"integral\" salaries, to, 
e.g., minimum age of 60 (55 for women), time of service 35 
years (30), 20 years in public employment, of which at least 
10 in career specialty and five in last position. 
 
--(vii) current public functionaries who retire earlier than 
the new minimum age limits of 60 and 55 years to receive 
3.5% per year less pension if they take retirement before 
December 2005 or 5.0% less if after January 1, 2006. 
 
5.  The GoB projects that its new pension law will yield 
fiscal savings of fifty billion Reals, net present value, 
over the next couple of decades (albeit the methodology has 
never been convincingly laid out.)  Already in 2004, savings 
are meant to be of the order of 1.0 billion Reals from new 
taxation of public-sector retirees\' pensions, plus 1.7 
billion Reals from taxing private-sector workers\' salaries 
up to the raised ceiling of 2,400 Reals a month vs. the 
previous ceiling of 1,869 Reals.  Modest though this fiscal 
economy may seem, market interlocutors have consistently 
assured us that it meets their litmus test of \"staunching 
Previdencia\'s budget bleeding\" and leaves them content. 
 
6.  Meanwhile, however, an ugly new cloud has formed on 
Brazil\'s pension skyline.  Deficits on Previdencia\'s INSS 
(private-sector pension) side, which until 1995 was always 
in surplus, are rocketing up ever more steeply.  Indeed, the 
INSS deficit in 2004 will reportedly for the first time in 
history be larger, easily, than the public-sector pension 
system\'s notorious fiscal crater.  The 2002 INSS deficit, a 
nominal 18 billion Reals, accounted for only about a quarter 
of Previdencia\'s overall fiscal gap.  For 2003, though, INSS 
is projected to be 27.5 billion Reals in the red; for 2004, 
31.7 billion Reals, vs. a forecast 29.7 billion Reals for 
the public-sector side.  In other words, the 2004 increase 
in INSS\'s deficit will likely more than swallow up the 2.7 
billion Reals in savings that year which the GoB itself 
estimates its public-sector pension reform will bring, and 
so on for the indefinite future. 
 
7.  The following table illustrates the evolution of INSS 
yearly deficits according to official Previdencia Ministry 
data re-printed under a December 7 `Estado de Sao Paulo\' 
headline \"Hole in the INSS Will Require a New Reform Soon\": 
 
1995 -- 0.46 billion Reals 
1996 -- 0.40 
1997 -- 4.57 
1998 -- 10.2 
1999 -- 12.8 
2000 -- 12.9 
2001 -- 15.2 
2002 -- 18.3 
2003 -- 27.2 
2004 -- 31.5 (estimated) 
 
(Embassy translation of the text of the `Estado de Sao 
Paulo\' article being sent Septel.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8.  This previously unpublicized trend towards giant INSS 
deficits on the private-sector side seems to hold somber 
implications for Lula.  First, the tangible if modest 
immediate savings from this year\'s pension reform which the 
GoB might have hoped to put towards social programs or 
investment in 2004-2005, have already evidently evaporated. 
Second, the rate of increase of the INSS deficit looks set 
to outstrip public-sector savings from the reform through 
the medium term, based on the GoB\'s own projections. 
 
9.  As the GoB reduced its pension-reform ambitions in the 
course of this year\'s legislative horse-trading, it became 
near-conventional wisdom that pension reform would need to 
be re-visited within, say, a half-dozen years.  The updated 
INSS arithmetic may pose the necessity for such re-visiting 
to take place in the medium, not long, term -- perhaps even 
during Lula\'s current administration, rather than the 
politically more palatable prospect of 2007/08.  Otherwise, 
market nerves over Brazil\'s fiscal prospects and debt 
sustainability could eventually re-commence to jangle.

TAGS: EFIN, SNAR, BR 
SUBJECT:  BRAZIL 2002-2003 INCSR:  PART II - FINANCIAL 
CRIMES AND MONEY LAUNDERING 
 
REF:  A) STATE 240035 
 
      B) BRASILIA 4415 
 
1.  Following is the Financial Crimes and Money Laundering 
section of Brazil\'s 2002-2003 INCSR.  Ref B transmits post\'s 
submission of the non-money laundering portion. 
 
2.  Due to its great size and large economy, Brazil is 
considered a regional financial center.  It is not, 
however, an offshore financial center.  Brazil 
maintains adequate banking regulation, retains some 
controls on capital flows and requires disclosure of 
the ownership of corporations.  Brazilian authorities 
report that money laundering in Brazil is primarily a 
problem of domestic crime, including contraband goods 
smuggling and corruption, both of which generate funds 
that may be laundered through the banking system, real 
estate investment or financial asset markets.  The 
proceeds of narcotics trafficking and organized 
criminal activities are laundered in like fashion.  The 
authorities have not uncovered any evidence of 
terrorism-related money laundering.  Money laundering 
is a criminal offense in Brazil. 
 
3.  According to Brazilian authorities, Brazilian 
institutions do not engage in currency transactions 
that include significant amounts of U.S. currency, 
currency derived from illegal drug sales in the U.S., 
or that otherwise significantly affect the U.S.  The 
authorities believe that organized crime groups use the 
proceeds of domestic drug trafficking to purchase 
weapons from Colombian guerilla groups. 
 
4.  Brazil\'s 1998 money laundering law (Law 9613 of 
March 3, 1998) and related regulations make money 
laundering a criminal activity and require financial 
entities and other appropriate organizations to 
maintain records and report suspicious financial 
transactions.  Money laundering is a criminal offense 
if engaged in to conceal the proceeds of narcotics 
trafficking, terrorism, weapons trafficking, 
kidnapping, acts against the public administration 
(corruption), acts against the financial system and 
acts committed by a criminal organization. 
 
5.  Brazilian Financial institutions, real estate 
agents, currency exchanges, stock brokerages, lottery 
game operators and dealers in fine art and antiquities 
are required by the 1998 law to know their customers 
and to maintain adequate records of transactions and of 
the parties involved.  They must report suspicious 
transactions.  Financial entities and their managers 
that fail to meet these requirements can be 
administratively punished.  These sanctions include 
fines and revocation of operating licenses.  A 2001 law 
(Complementary Law 105 of January 10, 2001) requires 
financial institutions to provide law enforcement 
agencies full access to financial transactions 
information, including information on the ownership of 
client companies, in cases of investigations into money 
laundering, terrorism finance, narcotics trafficking, 
weapons trafficking kidnapping, corruption and 
organized crime. 
 
6.  The Council for the Control of Financial Activities 
(COAF) is responsible for coordinating the governmental 
agencies addressing money laundering and is also the 
central recipient of required reports regarding suspect 
financial activities.  Any suspicious transaction or 
transaction above 10,000 Reals must be reported.  COAF 
receives from 300 to 500 suspicious transaction reports 
a month, about 2% of which lead to formal 
investigations by law enforcement.  A number of bank 
accounts and other funds were blocked because of 
suspicion of money laundering.  In some instances, 
funds were forfeited following judicial decisions.  In 
2003 Brazilian courts handed down their first criminal 
conviction for money laundering.  The case involved 
illegal transfer of money overseas through a currency 
exchange in Foz do Iguacu.  A flood of new 
investigations (1,043 in 2003, up from 345 in 2002) has 
led to a sharp spike in the number of money laundering 
cases going to court (132 in 2003, up from 34 in 2002). 
To deal with the flood of cases, the authorities have 
created seven special money laundering courts and 
expect to create one more.  The judges in these courts 
generally have received some specialized training to 
deal with money laundering cases. 
7.  Brazilian authorities do not believe cross-border 
transportation of illegal source currency to be a 
significant problem in Brazil.  Cross-border movement 
of more than 10,000 Reals of currency or negotiable 
instruments must be reported. 
 
Terrorism Finance 
 
8.  In July 2003, President da Silva signed legislation 
that criminalizes terrorism financing (Law 10.701 of 
July 9, 2003, which amends Law 9.613 of March 3 1998), 
making it a predicate offense under the money 
laundering law.  The legislation clarified previously 
existing authority under the money laundering law and 
presidential decrees implementing U.N. Security Council 
resolutions that gave the government the authority to 
search for and block terrorist financial assets. 
Brazilian authorities have cooperated in searching for 
assets of individuals and organizations identified as 
terrorists by the UNSCR 1267 sanctions committee.  As 
of December 2003, the GoB had not located any terrorist 
financial assets in Brazil.  Brazil is a signatory of 
the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression 
of the Financing of Terrorism, but has not yet ratified 
the agreement. 
 
International Cooperation 
 
9.  Brazil is a full member of the Financial Action 
Task Force (FATF) and has chaired the regional sub- 
group, FATF-South.  The Council for the Control of 
Financial Activities (COAF) exchanges information with 
other countries.  Brazil has bilateral information 
exchange agreements with 12 other countries, including 
Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain, Bolivia, Guatemala, 
Panama, Paraguay, Colombia and Russia and is 
negotiating agreements with nine more.  Brazilian law 
allows information exchange on a reciprocal basis 
without need for a bilateral agreement and conducts 
such exchanges with many countries.  Brazil also is a 
member of the Egmont Group of financial intelligence 
units (FIUs) and is connected to the group\'s secure 
network, which facilitates information exchange among 
member FIUs worldwide.  As a matter of government 
policy, neither Brazil nor any of its representatives 
engages, encourages, or facilitates laundering of 
proceeds from illegal transactions of any kind. 
 
10.  Brazil has cooperated with appropriate law 
enforcement agencies of the USG and other governments 
investigating financial crimes. 
 
11.  Brazil has established systems for identifying, 
tracing, freezing, seizing, and forfeiting narcotics- 
related assets.  These systems are managed jointly by 
COAF and the Justice Ministry.  The judicial system has 
the authority to forfeit seized assets.  Police 
authorities, customs, and Brazilian revenue service are 
responsible for tracing and seizing assets, and have 
adequate police powers and resources to perform such 
activities. 
 
12.  Brazil\'s money laundering law permits the sharing 
of forfeited assets with other countries.  Traffickers 
have not taken any retaliatory actions related to money 
laundering investigations, government cooperation with 
the USG, or seizure of assets.

SUBJECT:  PRESIDENT LULA ANNOUNCES BRAZIL\'S NEW ENERGY MODEL 
 
REF:  A. BRASILIA 3405 
      B. BRASILIA 3088 
      C. BRASILIA 2859 
 
1.  President Lula announced Brazil\'s new energy model and 
signed the provisional measures (MP) to implement it on 
December 11.  The MP was published in the Official Daily of 
the Union December 12.  The GoB had long reiterated its 
intent to introduce the model before year\'s end, but there 
was doubt as to whether it would do so by MP or by 
submitting a bill to the legislature.  The MP gave the 
energy model the full force of the law as written, and was 
to be debated in congress within 60 days, with a potential 
extension of another 60 days.  On January 16, \"O Globo\" 
online reported that the PSDB party had filed a Supreme 
Court injunction complaining that to enact the new model via 
MP was unconstitutional.  The injunction suspends the effect 
of the MP until the Supreme Court either decides it is 
unconstitutional, which kills the MP, or allows the bill to 
move forward, thereby starting the 60-day clock.  Still, 
Lula\'s proclamation formally fulfills another major item on 
his policy agenda for his first year. 
 
2.  Mines and Energy Minister Rousseff, Finance Minister 
Palocci, and Chief of Staff Dirceu were all present for the 
ceremony, along with presidents of five state-owned 
generation companies.  Glaringly absent were any company 
presidents from the private sector.  Brazilian daily \'Valor 
Economico\' reported December 12 that distributors and 
private generating companies were dissatisfied with the 
model\'s \"lack of isonomy\" (i.e., its purportedly advantaging 
state-owned entities over private enterprise in the energy 
sector), and chose not to be present. 
 
3. The main tenets of the new energy model unveiled in July 
by Rousseff (Ref. C) remain intact.  Two contractual 
environments are to co-exist: a regulated pool for \"captive\" 
customers, and an unregulated \"free\" market.  The Electric 
Energy Trading Chamber (CCEE) is to replace the current 
Wholesale Energy Market (MAE) and administer the pool. 
Distributors are to purchase energy from the pool via bid, 
with the winner being the distributor guaranteeing its 
captive consumers the lowest tariffs.  Current concession 
contracts will be honored to expiration, so that the first 
large auction under the new rules should take place in 2005, 
when up to 50% of the existing contracts expire.  As 
concessions for \"captive\" consumers are granted, CCEE is to 
administer bilateral contracts between all sixty-four 
distributors and the generators concerned, as described in 
ref. c.  The \"free\" environment is to be unregulated, with 
the free customers and distributors able to negotiate their 
own contracts.  Generators, 80% of which are still publicly- 
owned, will be the only entities allowed to contract in both 
environments. 
 
4.  The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) will grant 
generation concessions.  Those concessions are to be 
auctioned in megawatt blocks, rather than by project as they 
are now.  Auctions of both generation and transmission 
concessions will be conducted through ANEEL based on the 
regulations of, and with oversight from, the National 
Council for Energy Policy (CNPE) -- an existing body that is 
controlled by MME. 
 
5.  The National Operator of Electrical Systems (ONS) is to 
remain responsible for the coordination and control of 
generation and transmission operations, and for 
administration the contracting of transmission installation. 
Currently, ONS is an industry entity, but under the new 
energy model three of five directors will be selected by 
MME, and the other two by the private sector.  The 
directors\' current two-year mandates will change to four- 
year terms. 
 
6. Two planning bureaucracies are to be set up: the 
Electricity Sector Monitoring Committee (CMSE), which will 
monitor the sector\'s ability to meet energy needs in the 
short term (5 years); and the Energy Research Company (EPE), 
which will be responsible for medium and long-term planning 
(up to twenty years) for energy expansion.  EPE will also 
establish requirements for the safety reserve. 
 
7.  Early reaction in the press is that the new energy model 
puts a damper on foreign investment and strengthens the 
power of the state.  Claudio Sales, president of CBIEE, an 
association of the 15 largest private investors in the 
energy sector, told \'Valor\' December 12 that the 
concentration of decision-making and regulation would be in 
the hands of MME and state-owned Electrobras, which opens 
the door to political pressure on the sector.  A headline in 
the December 14 edition of \'O Estado de Sao Paulo\' 
proclaimed, \"For the Market, Only the State Will Invest in 
the Sector\".  Andre Valle, post-graduate energy coordinator 
at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, told \'Estado\' that the 
government must now prove it has money to pump into the 
electrical sector; the new rules discourage private 
investment, especially foreign investment. 
 
8.  Mission will follow up with more industry reaction and 
analysis on the new energy model as extra detail emerges.

SUBJECT:  LULA\'S TAX REFORM PASSES:  WHAT IT LEAVES TO BE 
DONE 
 
REF: (A) Brasilia 3910, (B) Brasilia 3734, 
     (C) Brasilia 3682, (D) Brasilia 3684 
 
1.  LULA\'S TAX-REFORM BILL PASSED ITS SECOND SENATE VOTE ON 
DECEMBER 17 BY 64 VOTES TO FIVE AND WILL BECOME LAW WHEN 
PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL GAZETTE ON DECEMBER 22.  HAVING 
ALREADY GAINED PASSAGE OF HIS PENSION REFORM BILL LAST WEEK 
(REF A), LULA HAS THUS ACHIEVED HIS TOP TWIN LEGISLATIVE 
PRIORITY FOR HIS FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE, AND CAN CLAIM IN THIS 
AREA TO HAVE OUTSTRIPPED HIS PREDECESSOR\'S LEGISLATIVE 
RESULTS IN FHC\'S WHOLE SECOND TERM (THOUGH LULA IS UNLIKELY 
TO POINT OUT THAT THE PT WAS THE MAIN ROADBLOCK TO REFORM 
THROUGHOUT THAT PERIOD.) 
 
2.  THE TAX BILL\'S CONTENTS, HOWEVER, HAVE BEEN VASTLY 
TRUNCATED SINCE LULA PRESENTED ITS INITIAL VERSION LAST 
MARCH IN EYE-CATCHING STYLE, PERSONALLY LEADING TO THE 
CONGRESS BUILDING A PARADE OF BRAZIL\'S GOVERNORS IN WHAT WAS 
MEANT TO SHOW THE LATTER\'S SOLIDARITY WITH LULA\'S REFORM 
AIMS.  AS DESCRIBED IN REF B, THE GOVERNORS SOON DIVIDED AND 
FELL AWAY, FORCING LULA\'S TEAM TO RECOGNIZE THAT ITS 
ORIGINAL DESIGN WOULD NOT PASS.  THE GOB SETTLED FOR A RUMP 
BILL THAT ASSURED IT OF THE TWO CORE MEASURES WHOSE PASSAGE 
BY JANUARY 1, 2004 WAS VITAL FOR THE GOB BUDGET:  EXTENSION 
OF THE CPMF (FINANCIAL-SERVICES `CONTRIBUTION\' TAX) AT ITS 
PRESENT 0.38% RATE, AND OF THE DRU (GOB AUTHORITY TO DE-LINK 
20% OF TAX REVENUES FROM CONSTITUTIONALLY-MANDATED 
EARMARKS.)  ALL THE MAJOR CHANGES CONCEIVED TO FOSTER TAX 
TRANSPARENCY, BETTER CONDITIONS FOR PRIVATE-SECTOR 
PRODUCTION, AND -- ESPECIALLY -- AN END TO THE CHAOTIC, ZERO- 
SUM \"FISCAL WAR\" WAGED BETWEEN BRAZIL\'S STATES ON THE BASIS 
OF THEIR AUTHORITY TO SET INDIVIDUAL RATES FOR THE MAIN ICMS 
TAX, WERE STRIPPED OUT TO FACE AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE. 
 
3.  As passed, the tax \"reform\" law (i) extends the DRU and 
the CPMF for four years, (ii) creates a Regional Development 
Fund with resources of Reals 2.2 billion to disburse in 
2004, (iii) provides for the transfer to state and city 
governments of 25% of the federal government\'s revenues from 
the Cide (fuel) tax (which currently total approximately 12 
billion Reals p.a.) and levies the Cide on imports of 
petroleum and its derivatives, formerly exempt, (iv) adds 
Reals one billion to the Municipal Participation Fund, (v) 
bans the extension by Brazilian state governments of special 
fiscal incentives from the date of the law\'s effect, but 
apparently leaves ultimate determination of the issue to a 
complementary law, (vi) provides for another complementary 
law to define eventual reduction in the CPMF rate down to 
0.08%, subject to a \"trigger\" of favorable fiscal 
circumstances, (vii) raises to Reals 6.5 billion the total 
GoB fund to compensate state budgets for revenue losses 
incurred due to the federal \"Kandir Law,\" which exempts 
exports from the ICMS tax. 
 
4.  Related tax-reform items outside the approved bill: 
 
-- The GoB apparently still hopes to finalize the reform of 
Brazil\'s \"cascading\" Cofins (social-contribution) tax before 
the end of this year.  The Cofins issue was separated out 
from Lula\'s main tax bill into a presidential Provisional 
Measure (MP) just last month.  All legislators agree the end 
of Cofins\' \"cumulativity\" is essential, but the broad non- 
GoB view is that the MP\'s proposed hike in the one-time 
Cofins rate to 7.6% from its present 3% would intolerably 
increase Brazil\'s overall tax burden.  Among other things, 
the MP would start to levy Cofins on import. 
 
-- The ICMS issue is being sent back to the lower Chamber, 
effectively for debate on it to be re-opened there, but with 
no voting schedule stipulated (and debate next year, as 
noted by the December 18 `Estado de Sao Paulo,\' would take 
place in the full friction of a local-election year, to 
which its content would be extraordinarily sensitive.) 
-- Finance Minister Palocci has reasserted GoB proposals to 
reduce the IPI (Industrial Production tax) on capital goods, 
and to levy social-security and perhaps other taxes not on a 
company\'s total payroll but on its gross revenues.  Debate 
on these and other production-friendly GoB tax-reform aims 
remains in an early stage. 
 
5.  The above outcome marks what is meant to be just the 
first of three phases in Lula\'s GoB\'s overall tax-reform 
plan.  In the next stage, Brazil\'s National Counsel of 
Financial Policy (CONFAZ, consisting of individual state 
Secretaries of Finance from all Brazil\'s states) in 2004 is 
 
SIPDIS 
to agree and oversee (with Senate ratification) the 
reduction of Brazil\'s chaotically multitudinous ICMS rates 
(reportedly 44) to just five national ones, by product.  In 
the third and final stage, the ICMS, IPI (federal Industrial 
Production tax) and ISS (Municipal Services tax) are 
supposed to be combined into a single national VAT.  Hardly 
by chance, this last and most transformational change is to 
be tackled not before 2007, i.e., after Lula\'s presumptive 
reelection campaign. 
 
6.  Financial daily `Valor Economico\' on December 15 
reviewed where the watering-down of the GoB\'s tax bill has 
left things.  The `Valor\' article featured a detailed list 
of future constitutional amendments, complementary laws, 
decrees or regulations which the GoB will need to obtain in 
order to implement even the changes contained in the present 
reform, let alone its ambitious further hopes.  Following is 
Embassy\'s unofficial translation of the useful `Valor\' 
article in question, which appeared shortly before the tax 
reform\'s final passage.  Main text is in para 7; the list of 
further legislation required, in para 8. 
 
7.  (Begin Text) 
 
HEADLINE: PASSAGE OF THE REFORM DOES NOT GUARANTEE CHANGE IN 
THE TAX MODEL 
 
The goal of the Lula administration was to finish the 
debate concerning tax and pension reform by the end of 
this year, but the passage of the essential part of the 
two proposals that should occur on the 19th doesn\'t 
guarantee a change in concept of the tax model.  \"Tax 
reform is a process.  Passage (in the Senate) will only 
kindle this process\", said the government\'s leader of the 
Senate, Aloizio Mercadante (PT-SP).  Most of the 
structural changes proposed in the Senate -- that could 
lead to tax simplification, the end of the fiscal war, and 
reduction of the tax burden -- depend on new legislation. 
 
The estimate is that the second round of voting in the 
Senate will be finished on the 18th.  In separate votes 
during in the first round, the senators defeated in floor 
votes the amendment proposed by the bill\'s sponsor, Romero 
Juca (PMDB-RR) who proposed the delinking (DRE) of 10% of 
state and municipal revenues in the social-program part of 
their budget. 
 
After conclusion of voting in the second round, Congress 
will immediately resume work in 2004 discussing at least 
two constitutional amendment proposals (about the gradual 
reduction of the CPMF, and the incidence of Cide and 
Cofins taxes) and another Provisional Measure that will 
address the tax exoneration of companies\' payrolls, 
replacing part of the social security contributions 
collected on salaries by payments based on total turnover, 
in a non-cumulative manner. 
 
In addition, after publication of the whole reform, whose 
date will depend on the political will of the deputies and 
will require a new political agreement, Congress will have 
to analyze at least six proposed complementary laws.  The 
government\'s expectation is that at least two bills can be 
transacted starting in the second half of 2004.  Judging 
by the text of the tax reform approved in the Senate, two 
projects would need to be voted on in Congress by December 
31, 2004: one that specifies the rules for unifying the 
five new ICMS rates and also exoneration of the `basic 
basket\', agricultural inputs and minimum consumption of 
energy; and one which presents rules for a new industrial 
policy for the country, in order to offset the end of 
fiscal incentives. 
 
If reform takes a long time to conclude, its efficacy will 
also be long-term, in the opinion of Finance Minister 
Antonio Palocci.  \"Tax policy doesn\'t belong to the 
government, nor the opposition.  It is a policy for 40, 50 
years, and it\'s for Brazil,\" emphasized the minister, 
after complimenting the senators last Friday for their 
drawn-out negotiations and for their having voted for the 
reform in the first round. 
 
Palocci used his typical good humor and optimism to 
comment on the need for broad political effort by the 
Chamber to conclude, in fact, the voting for the reform. 
\"We have to think like Mineiros:  everything will turn out 
well.  If it\'s not well done, it\'s not finished.\" 
 
The Minister said that the economic team is still 
calculating the financial impact of the reform.  According 
to the government technical experts involved in the 
negotiations, the biggest probable amount to be released 
in 2004, which is one billion Reals for the 
Municipalities\' Participation Fund and 2.2 billion Reals 
for the Regional Development Fund, will come from an 
increase in IPI collections, since the mechanism for 
cumulative compensation from Cofins will no longer exist. 
 
For Palocci, the proposal voted on in the Senate \"balances 
the budgets of federative entities, doesn\'t increase the 
tax burden and creates a set of significant benefits.\" 
The minister recognizes, however, that tax reduction will 
only occur long-term.  \"Brazil should seek a long-term 
reduction of the tax burden, and this should be done 
responsibly, that is looking at commitments and the 
country\'s economic balance\", he affirmed.  This mechanism 
of gradual tax reduction, emphasized Palocci, will have to 
be discussed as part of a new proposed constitutional 
amendment, which could be presented today (December 15) by 
Senator Tasso Jereissati (PSDB-CE), but would only be 
voted on next year. 
 
The minister also recognized that the unification of ICMS 
rates -- which will have to be discussed anew in the 
Chamber - does not materially affect the Federal 
Government.  \"The ICMS question, though it does not affect 
us, does greatly affect the economy,\" he justified. 
 
Another polemical issue that will only be discussed at the 
end of Lula\'s mandate is creation of an IVA (Value Added 
Tax).  That will also require a constitutional amendment, 
and as it is a most controversial subject, there is no 
political guarantee that the lawmakers will approve this 
constitutional amendment and introduce the new tax. 
 
(End Embassy Translation of Main Text) 
 
 
8.  (Start Embassy Translation of Inset Headlined:  REFORM 
UNDER CONSTRUCTION/Tax changes that depend on new laws) 
 
New Proposals for Constitutional Amendments (PEC in 
Portuguese acronym) 
 
-- CPMF:  a new PEC will be presented today (December 15), 
drawn up by Senator Tasso Jereissati (PSDB-CE) that will 
change the constitutional regulation, fixing the maximum 
(0.38%) and minimum (0.08%) rate of the contribution and 
determining that as of 2005 it can fall, gradually, 
according to macroeconomic conditions.  Criteria for 
reduction of the CPMF rate and of the tax burden will have 
to be defined in a complementary law. 
 
-- Cide/Cofins:  a new PEC will also be presented today, 
drawn up by Senator Rodolpho Tourinho (PFL-BA), changing 
the language of Articles 149 and 195 of the Constitution. 
The objective is to make clear that Cide only applies to 
domestic or imported petroleum derivatives.  In addition, 
it specifies that any social contribution (tax) can only 
be applied to imports if it is also charged on domestic 
production. 
 
-- IVA: The tax reform anticipates a Value Added Tax (IVA 
in Portuguese acronym) in 2007.  Since this tax will be 
the fruit of the unification of the ICMS, IPI and ISS 
taxes, various articles of the Constitution will need to 
be modified.  The government is not mentioning any time 
frame for this PEC. 
 
-- Progressive ITBI (transferal/inheritance of goods and 
real estate):  The government wants to take up the debate 
again on a progressive estate tax, but the lawmakers and 
executive need to elaborate another PEC, since the final 
text of the tax reform approved by the Senate defeated the 
progressivity idea and left collection as it is today - 2% 
tax for all transactions.  This new PEC can only be 
presented in 2004. 
 
 
Complementary Law Proposals 
 
-- Exemption of the basic consumer basket, machines and 
agricultural inputs, medicines for human use, minimum 
consumption of electric energy/Unification of ICMS rates: 
after promulgation, the government promised to submit this 
bill in a maximum of 120 days.  The constitutional text 
approved in the Senate requires this law to be promulgated 
by December 31, 2004. 
 
-- Industrial policy: as a form of compensation for the 
end of the fiscal war, the government promises to submit a 
law that will define the concession of credits and federal 
incentives favoring regional development.  Deadline:  120 
days after promulgation of the entire tax reform. 
 
-- Reduction of the Tax Burden:  the \"trigger\" that links 
tax-rate reduction to the improvement of macroeconomic 
conditions also depends on a complementary law.  The 
government promises that this law will also be submitted 
120 days after promulgation of the whole tax reform. 
 
-- Definition of criteria for re-examining the budget for 
the Export Compensation Fund:  the fund is automatically 
extended into 2004, but the States want to change the 
criteria for the transfer of resources, to consider the 
export balance and type of export, and this will also 
depend on a complementary law.  The date for submitting 
the bill is not specified in the text of the reform. 
 
-- Fiscal Incentives:  The reform says that incentives can 
only be conceded up to the definitive promulgation date of 
the proposed constitutional amendment, and that their 
maximum life is 11 years.  However, the Congress will have 
to approve a complementary law \"defining rules in effect 
at the time of concession, that will remain applicable.\" 
 
-- Regional Development Fund:  The text of the reform 
states that the fund will go into effect immediately after 
final promulgation of the PEC, when the concession of 
fiscal incentives ends.  A complementary law will be 
needed to define criteria for distribution of resources 
from this Fund to the States. 
 
 
Decree/revenue regulations/Provisional Measures (MP in 
Portuguese acronym) 
 
-- Decree by the Treasury Ministry to gradually exempt 
capital goods from the IPI (Industrial Production Tax): 
Minister Palocci has said this will be drafted at the end 
of the month, immediately after promulgation of the first 
phase of reform. 
 
-- Cide MP:  The government promises to edit, probably by 
the end of December, an interim measure defining the 
criteria for transfer of Cide (fuel-tax) revenues to 
states and municipalities. 
 
-- MP to exempt payroll:  the constitutional principle to 
do so is guaranteed in the tax reform, but the government 
has promised to send the MP within 90 days after passage 
of the law establishing the non-cumulative collection of 
Cofins. 
 
-- The national register of taxpayers anticipated to be 
part of the third phase of reform (2007) may be created 
via a normative instruction by the Federal Treasury.

USTR (Cronin and Blue). 
 
IMPORT POLICIES 
 
Brazil\'s arithmetic average applied tariff was an 
estimated 11.5 percent in 2003.  Brazil currently 
maintains no applied tariff rates in excess of 35 percent, 
but does have safeguard measures in place for some 
imports, such as toys.  For example, Brazil imposes 
tariffs between 4.5-16.5% on wood products and 22% on 
motorcycles.  In April 2002, the Brazilian government 
approved a new tax law that dramatically increased the 
duty on imported advertising materials and discriminates 
between domestic and foreign producers.  A number of 
imports are prohibited, including various used goods such 
as machinery, foreign blood products, refurbished medical 
equipment, automobiles, clothing, and other consumer 
goods. 
 
Brazil and its MERCOSUR partners, Argentina, Paraguay and 
Uruguay, implemented the MERCOSUR Common External Tariff 
(CET) on January 1, 1995.  The CET currently covers 9,626 
items, with tariffs mostly ranging between zero and 21.5 
percent.  Within the CET, certain sectors are treated 
separately and are organized on special lists.  The list 
for informatics and telecommunication goods contains 427 
items with tariffs in 2002 ranging between zero and 26 
percent; a tariff phase-down schedule should bring the top 
tariff down to 16 by 2006.  The automotive list covers 55 
items (vehicles and parts) with a tariff rate of 35 
percent; Brazil has negotiated automotive agreements with 
third countries, which provide duty-free treatment within 
quotas.  A MERCOSUR suspension of duties ranging from 2 to 
15.5 percent on some 550 pharmaceutical products has been 
extended until December 31, 2003.  Although the CET was 
meant to be a comprehensive, common tariff schedule, 
MERCOSUR countries have agreed to allow exceptions. 
Brazil has 100 exceptions to the CET, with tariffs 
reaching as high as 55 percent on coconuts and peaches. 
In addition, after consulting with its MERCOSUR neighbors, 
in November 1997 Brazil implemented a temporary three- 
percentage point increase on most CET tariff items.  For 
almost all products, this additional tariff was reduced to 
1.5 percent by the end of 2002, with its total elimination 
expected at the end of 2003.  Currently, 3450 CET items 
are excluded, including 1152 capital goods.  The CET 
remains a significant barrier to increased U.S. exports of 
agricultural products, distilled spirits, and computer and 
telecommunications equipment.  Brazil prohibits the 
importation of second hand consumer goods.  In addition, 
significant barriers exist to U.S. textile exports.  In 
particular, Brazil applies additional import taxes and 
charges that can effectively double the actual cost of 
importing textile products into Brazil. 
 
Virtually all imports from its MERCOSUR partners enter 
Brazil duty-free.  Notable exceptions are automobiles and 
automobile parts, which are subject to out-of-quota 
tariffs, and refined sugar, which is assessed a 17.5 
percent tariff.  Two-way trade between Brazil and its 
MERCOSUR partners increased by 25 percent during January 
to October 2003 compared with the same period a year 
earlier, evidence of continuing economic improvement that 
began in 2002.  In a December 16, 2003 summit, MERCOSUR 
leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen the 
customs union and work to fully integrate the MERCOSUR 
common market by 2006.  MERCOSUR plans to finalize free- 
trade agreements with three Andean countries, Colombia, 
Venezuela, and Ecuador.  Peru and Bolivia are currently 
associate members. 
 
Import Licensing/Customs Valuation 
 
The Secretariat of Foreign Trade (SECEX) implemented a 
computerized trade documentation system (SISCOMEX) in 
early 1997 to handle import licensing.  All importers must 
register with SECEX to access SISCOMEX; registration 
requirements are onerous, including a minimum capital 
requirement.  In addition, fees are assessed for each 
import statement submitted through SISCOMEX.  As a general 
rule, imports into Brazil fall within an \"automatic import 
license\" process.  Originally, Brazil\'s non-automatic 
import licensing system was used only in cases of specific 
imports that require special authorization from specific 
ministries/agencies: beverages (Ministry of Agriculture); 
pharmaceuticals (Ministry of Health); arms and munitions 
(National Defense Ministry); etc.  In 1998, the Brazilian 
government stopped publishing a list of products subject 
to non-automatic licenses; the only method available now 
for determining if a product requires an import license is 
to check the SISCOMEX system, which is available only to 
registered importers.  Under Brazil\'s non-automatic import 
licensing system, U.S. suppliers have no means of finding 
out in advance which products require import licenses and 
whether they are subject to minimum price and payment 
terms as a condition of receiving a license. 
 
Under Brazilian customs regulations, a \"gray line\" process 
exists for enhanced scrutiny of suspected fraudulent 
imports.  This process is opaque and burdens some 
categories of U.S. exports.  A related concern has been 
the possible use of the gray line process to impose 
minimum reference prices.  In November 1999, the United 
States actively participated as an interested third party 
in EU WTO consultations on the issue, and in July 2000, 
the United States held its own WTO consultations with 
Brazil. The Brazilian Government denies the use of minimum 
reference prices and reportedly has modified its customs 
regime in response to these consultations. 
 
Product registrations from the Ministry of Health are 
required for imported processed food products and food 
supplement products, and as of March 1, 2000, the term of 
validity for registration was shortened.  Registration 
fees for these imports, as well as for medical and 
pharmaceutical products, have increased significantly. 
The U.S. Government also has received complaints relating 
to Brazilian practices that lead to non-transparent 
preferences for Brazilian products in procurement bids for 
government and nonprofit hospitals, and cause bias against 
the import of refurbished medical equipment when 
domestically produced \"similars\" exist. Implementation of 
such import measures continues to have a negative impact 
on U.S. exports, especially given the high tariffs on 
medical equipment.  Although some progress in increasing 
the transparency of the process was made at the end of 
2001, problems for U.S. exporters still exist. U.S. 
companies continue to complain of a variety of customs- 
related non-tariff barriers. 
 
The U.S. Government has received complaints that the ICMS 
value-added tax collected by individual states is 
sometimes set to favor local companies, constituting a 
non-tariff trade barrier.   Similarly, some U.S. companies 
have raised concerns about the arbitrary application of 
various non-automatic import licensing procedures, such as 
authorizations from the Federal Police and the Nuclear 
Regulatory Agency. 
 
STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING AND CERTIFICATION 
 
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 
 
Progress has been made in the area of sanitary and 
phytosanitary (SPS) measures.  On March 15, 2001, the 
Ministry of Agriculture lifted the ban on U.S. Soft Red 
Winter, Hard Red Spring, and Hard Red Winter wheat shipped 
from non-west coast ports.  The ban remains on Durum and 
White wheats and wheat from the states of Washington, 
Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada, and Arizona due to 
phytosanitary concerns.  The U.S.  Government continues to 
work with the Brazilian government to resolve the 
remaining import restrictions. 
 
Despite progress, SPS measures remain significant barriers 
in several cases.  Brazil continues to prohibit the entry 
of poultry and poultry products from the United States 
based on an alleged lack of reciprocity, contrary to WTO 
rules which dictate that sanitary and phytosanitary 
determinations be based upon sufficient scientific 
evidence.   Attempts to import seed potatoes into Brazil 
have been blocked by unresolved permit issues based upon a 
delayed and non-transparent pest risk assessment (PRA) 
before commercial market access is granted.  Brazilian 
legislation also bans the importation of beef produced 
with growth hormones; however, beef imports from the 
United States have been allowed on a waiver basis since 
1991. 
 
Biotechnology 
 
The biotechnology debate has captured public attention in 
Brazil with frequent and polemical reports in the press 
presenting various aspects of the issue.  Regulation of 
the biotech sector remains essentially frozen because of a 
1998 court case that is still pending in a federal court 
in Brasilia, filed by environmental NGOs against the use 
of Monsanto\'s Roundup Ready soybean variety.  The case 
addresses not only the requirement to conduct 
environmental impact studies on GMO products, but also the 
constitutional authority of the Government\'s CTNBio 
commission to approve biotech products. 
 
In the absence of a definitive court ruling on this case, 
President Lula made considerable progress in 2003 towards 
a new legal framework for production and marketing of 
biotech soybean crops.  Law 10,814 was enacted on December 
15, 2003 after being approved by Congress, and legalizes 
the planting and marketing biotech soybean crops for the 
2003/2004 harvest.   On October 31, 2003, President Lula 
sent to Congress the long-awaited draft of a Biosecurity 
Law that will provide a long-term regulatory regime for 
the biotech sector.  The current text of the bill 
envisions a complicated mechanism for approval of biotech 
products by a national commission attached to the 
President\'s office that would consider political and 
economic, as well as scientific factors.  It is likely 
that the bill will undergo substantial revision before 
passage, which is expected in April 2004. 
 
On April 24, 2003 the Brazilian Government published 
Decree Number 4680, which formally implemented the 
provisions of a 1990 law (law 8,078 of September 1990) 
that requires labeling of GMOs.  The decree requires 
labeling of GMOs and products containing GMOs, including 
meats from animals fed with GMO feed.  The label must 
include a special logo created by the Ministry of Justice 
in October 2003.  The requirement does not apply to 
packaged food products containing less than one percent of 
genetically modified organisms. 
 
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT 
 
Brazil is not a signatory to the WTO Plurilateral 
Agreement on Government Procurement, and   transparency in 
the procurement process could be improved. Remaining 
limitations on foreign capital participation in 
procurement bids can reportedly impair access for 
potential service providers in the energy and construction 
sectors.  Brazilian federal, state and municipal 
governments, as well as related agencies and companies, in 
general follow a \"buy national\" policy.  Although Law 8666 
of 1993, which covers most government procurement other 
than informatics and telecommunications, requires 
nondiscriminatory treatment for all bidders regardless of 
the nationality or origin of product or service, the law\'s 
implementing regulations allow consideration of non-price 
factors giving preferences to certain goods produced in 
Brazil and stipulating local content requirements for 
eligibility for fiscal benefits.  Decree 1070 of March 
1994, which regulates the procurement of information 
technology goods and services, requires federal agencies 
and parastatal entities to give preference to locally 
produced computer products based on a complicated and 
nontransparent price/technology matrix.  However, Brazil 
permits foreign companies to compete in any procurement- 
related multilateral development bank loans and opens 
selected procurements to international tenders. 
 
EXPORT SUBSIDIES 
 
The Government of Brazil offers a variety of tax, tariff, 
and financing incentives to encourage production for 
export and the use of Brazilian inputs in exported 
products.  An export credit program known as PROEX was 
established in 1991.  PROEX is intended to equalize 
domestic and international interest rates for export 
financing and to directly finance production of tradable 
goods.   Exporters enjoy exemption from withholding tax 
for remittances overseas for loan payments and marketing, 
as well as from the financial operations tax for deposit 
receipts on export products.  Several PROEX programs have 
been found to be countervailable under U.S. law in the 
context of specific countervailing duty cases.  In 1999, a 
WTO panel found PROEX interest equalization payments used 
to finance the sale of regional aircraft manufactured in 
Brazil to be a prohibited export subsidy.  The WTO 
Appellate Body upheld this finding.  The Government of 
Brazil states that it has modified PROEX so as to bring it 
into conformity with WTO subsidy rules.  Canada challenged 
this position in the WTO, but subsequently reached a 
negotiated settlement with Brazil, obviating the need for 
a WTO ruling on the merits of the case.  Changes to PROEX 
were announced most recently in 1999, expanding the 
program.  In 2003, roughly $808 million was budgeted for 
PROEX, with $400 million slated for equalization and $408 
million for direct financing.  Actual spending on PROEX 
during 2003 is expected to have been about half of the 
amount budgeted. 
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION 
 
Patents and Trademarks 
 
Brazil\'s industrial property law, covering patents and 
trademarks, took effect in May 1997.  The law improved 
most aspects of Brazil\'s industrial property regime, 
providing patent protection for pharmaceutical products 
and processes, agrochemical products and other inventions. 
However, concerns continue about a provision that 
prohibits importation as a means of satisfying the 
requirement that the patent be \"worked\" in that country. 
This issue was the subject of a Dispute Settlement 
proceeding at the WTO, which was terminated without 
prejudice in June 2001. The dispute was terminated based 
on Brazil\'s commitment to hold talks with the U.S. should 
it deem necessary in the future to grant a compulsory 
license for failure to work a patent. 
 
On December 14, 1999, the Brazilian Government issued a 
Provisional Measure that became Law 10,196 in 2001, which 
includes some problematic provisions, including a 
requirement that Health Ministry approval be obtained 
prior to the issuance of a pharmaceutical patent. This 
would appear to conflict with Article 27 of the TRIPS 
Agreement, and U.S. officials have raised this concern 
with their Brazilian counterparts.  \"Pipeline\" protection 
is provided for inventions not previously patentable in 
Brazil because of limitations on patentable subject 
matter, if these inventions were patented in another 
country and not marketed in Brazil.  While Brazil\'s patent 
office, the National Institute for Industrial Property 
(INPI), is addressing its backlog of both pipeline and 
regular patent applications, the resources and support 
necessary to effectively and consistently manage the 
processing of patent applications still appear to be 
insufficient. As of December 2003, industry sources 
reported that INPI had granted fifteen pipeline patents 
and fifty-seven regularly filed pharmaceutical patents. At 
the same time, unauthorized copies of pharmaceutical 
products have received sanitary registrations relying on 
undisclosed tests and other confidential data, in apparent 
violation of TRIPS Article 39.3. 
 
Following the WTO agreement on access to medicines in 
September 2003, President Lula issued a decree revising 
the implementation of Article 71 of Brazil\'s 1996 patent 
law, which governs the granting of compulsory licenses in 
cases of national emergency or public interest.  The 
decree essentially allows for the importation of copies of 
medicines from producer countries where patent protection 
does not exist in cases where local production of the 
medicine in not feasible.  The Brazilian government has 
yet to make use of the decree, but has publicly stated its 
intention to do so as a last resort in price negotiations 
with pharmaceutical companies supplying antiretrovirals to 
the country\'s National AIDS Program. 
 
On December 17, 2002, the Brazilian Congress passed Law 
10,603 on data confidentiality.  The law covers 
pharmaceuticals for veterinary use, fertilizers, 
agrotoxins, their components and related products; the law 
does not cover pharmaceuticals for human use.   The law 
provides data protection for only 10 years from the date 
of registration with the competent regulatory authority 
for products utilizing new chemical molecules or new 
biological organisms or until the first release of the 
information by the registration owner, with a minimum 
guaranteed period of protection for one year.  For 
products not utilizing new molecule or organisms, the 
period of protection is five years or until the first 
release of information with a one-year minimum period of 
protection.  Data demanded by the regulatory authority 
after registration will be protected for the duration of 
the protection period granted to the data used to gain the 
registration, or for one year after being presented, 
whichever is longer.  If the product is not commercialized 
within two years of the date of registration, third 
parties may request use of the data for registration 
purposes.  The regulatory authority may make compulsory 
use of the data in cases of national emergency or in 
certain circumstances relating to unfair competition. 
 
The 1997 industrial property law also added provisions for 
the protection of \"well-known\" trademarks, but contains a 
long list of categories of marks that cannot be 
registered. U.S. industry has expressed concern with the 
continued high level of counterfeiting in Brazil. A bill 
(PL_1787) on the protection of layout designs of 
integrated circuits (required by TRIPS) was introduced in 
April 1996 and is still progressing through committees 
within the Brazilian Congress. 
 
Copyrights 
 
A copyright bill that included amendments to bring Brazil 
into compliance with the Berne Convention and TRIPS was 
signed by President Cardoso in February 1998. A software 
law was signed by President Cardoso that same month, 
protecting computer programs as \"literary works,\" 
increasing the term of protection to 50 years, and making 
software infringement a fiscal and an intellectual 
property crime. Copyright enforcement in Brazil continues 
to be uneven, and losses from piracy remain significant. 
As a result of this concern, on January 10, 2001, the U.S. 
Government accepted a petition, submitted by the 
International Intellectual Property Alliance, to review 
the GSP status of Brazil.  This petition was reviewed as 
part of the 2003 Annual Generalized System of Preferences 
Product and Country Eligibility Review.  A Country 
Practices Review of Brazil was held in October 2003. The 
U.S. industry reports that in 2002 its trade losses from 
copyright piracy in Brazil were over $771 million, the 
largest amount of losses due to copyright piracy in the 
hemisphere. 
 
Problems have been particularly acute with respect to 
sound recordings and videocassettes, and virtually all 
audiocassettes sold are pirated copies. Brazil accounts 
for over half of the market for sound recordings in Latin 
America and is one of the world\'s largest markets for 
videos. Vigorous industry and Brazilian Government anti- 
piracy campaigns have had a positive impact and general 
awareness among the populace has increased significantly. 
 
In June 2003, the Brazilian Congress launched a 
Parliamentary Investigative Commission (CPI) on Piracy, 
which has gained wide support from industry for its 
action-oriented nature, as well as its willingness to 
address the official corruption inherent in piracy. 
Several Deputies on the CPI have pressed law enforcement 
officials to achieve notable apprehensions of perpetrators 
and counterfeited goods ranging from cigarettes to CDs. 
The CPI\'s 6-month mandate has recently been extended.  An 
outgrowth of the CPI, a Congressional caucus on piracy and 
tax evasion was formed in September 2003.   Efforts in 
2003 resulted in many prosecutions, but the number of 
convictions for intellectual property rights violations 
remains too low to act as a deterrent. While anti-piracy 
actions in 2003 resulted in several large seizures of 
pirated CDs, the sound recording industry estimates that 
the piracy rate for CDs in 2002 was 55 percent. Even with 
piracy raids and more prosecutions, the number of cases 
prosecuted and sentenced in Brazilian courts remains low, 
frustrating efforts at deterrence.  In July 2003, 
President Lula signed a law that doubled the minimum 
penalty for copyright violations.  The law also codifies 
procedures to seize and destroy contraband and gives 
judges authority to dispose of seized goods to ensure they 
will not be used for commercial purposes.   Brazil has 
increased inspections at border crossings increased, but 
significant amounts of pirated material continue to enter 
Brazil from Paraguay. 
 
The Federal Government of Brazil to date has not given 
police adequate tools or training to effectively enforce 
the law. Further, fines provided for in the penal code are 
too insignificant to create a true deterrent; and the 
court and judicial process is often unresponsive and slow. 
The generally inefficient nature of Brazil\'s courts and 
judicial system has complicated the enforcement of 
intellectual property rights.  The Brazilian Government is 
working to streamline the judicial process.  In early 
2001, the Government created an interagency IPR committee, 
coordinated by the Ministry of Justice, to improve anti- 
piracy enforcement.  After two years of very limited 
activity due to lack of resources and the 2002 national 
elections, the committee made progress in 2003 with a 
national public awareness campaign and the start of IPR 
training at the National Federal Police Training Academy. 
Brazil has not yet ratified the WIPO Treaties on Copyright 
and Performances and Phonograms. 
SERVICES BARRIERS 
 
Telecommunications 
Privatization within the telecommunications sector, which 
is based on the General Telecommunications Law of 1997, 
has presented regulatory challenges.  In the fixed-line 
sector, interconnection charges and other incumbency 
advantages have provided strong barriers for entry, and 
the companies created during a transitional duopoly stage 
have not fared well.  There was also heavy involvement on 
the judicial side during 2002 and 2003, as some incumbent 
companies used court injunctions to forestall competition. 
 
Brazil has not yet implemented its original WTO basic 
telecommunications commitments.  In 2001, Brazil withdrew 
its schedule of commitments in view of concerns raised by 
certain WTO members that it maintained the right of the 
Brazilian President to revoke concessions in the case of 
national emergency, in contravention of the WTO Basic 
Telecommunications Agreement.  This presidential right is 
contained in Brazil\'s 1997 General Law on 
Telecommunications and is inscribed in Brazil\'s 
constitution.  Brazil has not sought the constitutional 
change required to allow a revision of its schedule. 
Nonetheless, the current regulatory environment generally 
reflects commitments made by Brazil under the WTO Basic 
Telecommunications Agreement. 
 
Maritime 
 
The Government of Brazil considers the bilateral Maritime 
Agreement signed in October 1999 to be expired.  Bilateral 
consultations should result in a new agreement in 2004, 
and in the interim the regulatory agencies of Brazil and 
the United States have agreed to continue implementing the 
provisions of the 1999 agreement on a reciprocal basis. 
Key provisions of this agreement commit the parties to 
afford fair and nondiscriminatory access for national-flag 
carriers and third-flag carriers to competition on 
commercial cargo and provides equal and nondiscriminatory 
access to government cargos.  A 25 percent merchant marine 
tax on freight puts U.S. agricultural products at a 
competitive disadvantage to MERCOSUR products. 
 
Audio Visual Services 
 
Foreign ownership of cable companies is limited to 49 
percent.  The foreign owner must have a headquarters in 
Brazil and have had a presence in the country for the 
prior 10 years.  Foreign cable and satellite television 
operators are subject to an 11 percent remittance tax; 
however the tax can be avoided if the programmer invests 3 
percent of its remittances in co-production of Brazilian 
audio-visual services.  National cable and satellite 
operators are subject to a fixed title levy on foreign 
content and foreign advertising released on their 
channels. 
 
Provisional Measure 2,228 1/01 and later Law 10,454 aim to 
promote the national film industry through creation of the 
National Film Agency (ANCINE) and through various 
regulatory measures. Under Law 10,454, published on May 
14, 2002, a fixed title levy is imposed on the release of 
foreign films in theaters, foreign home entertainment 
products, and foreign programming for broadcast 
television.  Remittances to foreign producers of 
audiovisual works are subject to a 25 percent tax. 
Brazilian distributors of foreign films are subject to a 
levy equal to an 11 percent tax of their withholding 
taxes.  This tax, called the CONDECINE (Contribution to 
the Development of a National Film Industry), is waived 
for the Brazilian distributor if the producer of the 
foreign audiovisual work agrees to invest an amount equal 
to 70 percent of the tax on their remittances in co- 
productions with Brazilian film companies.  The CONDECINE 
tax also levied on any foreign cinematographic or 
videophonographic advertisement.  The fee may vary 
according to the advertising content and the transmission 
segment. 
 
Brazil also requires that 100 percent of all films and 
television shows be printed locally.  Importation of color 
prints for the theatrical and television markets is 
prohibited.  A theatrical screen quota for local films is 
maintained at 28 days per calendar year.  Quotas on 
domestic titles for home video distributors, while not 
currently enforced, present another potential hindrance to 
commerce. 
 
Foreign firms had been prohibited from owning capital in 
the \"open broadcast\" (non-cable) television sector. 
However, in October 2002, President Cardoso issued 
Provisional Measure 70, which was subsequently approved by 
the Congress, which permits up to 30 percent foreign 
ownership in Brazilian media.  This law covers print as 
well as the open television sector.  Open television 
companies also have a regulation requiring that 80 percent 
of their programming content be domestic in origin.  All 
broadcast media material that enters the country must pass 
through the Ministry of Justice, which retains rights to 
censure and edit content. 
 
Express Delivery Services 
 
A bill (PL 1491/99) that would reorganize the National 
Postal System remains under discussion in the Brazilian 
Congress.  The current proposal creates a regulatory 
agency for postal services as well as a new Postal Company 
of Brazil, owned and operated by the federal government. 
Although the bill would end the government monopoly over 
postal services after a ten-year period, it would also 
create a monopoly on the delivery of certain types of 
correspondence and parcels that are not now subject to 
regulation, such as express delivery packages, thereby 
significantly inhibiting market access by U.S. firms. 
 
Insurance 
 
Brazil is potentially South America\'s largest insurance 
market, and earnings from premiums have grown rapidly in 
recent years. In 1996, Brazil eliminated the distinction 
between foreign and domestic capital, and many major U.S. 
firms have since entered the market, mainly via joint 
ventures with established companies. The Brazil 
Reinsurance Institute (IRB) is a state monopoly. While a 
1996 constitutional reform ostensibly abolished the 
monopoly, private reinsurers have been precluded from 
operating in Brazil pending the IRB\'s privatization, which 
has been delayed indefinitely by a court decision.   A 
2003 Constitutional amendment allows for the regulation of 
the reinsurance sector, including market entry.  If 
Brazilian shipping companies wish to obtain foreign hull 
insurance, they must submit information to IRB 
demonstrating that the foreign insurance policy is less 
expensive than that offered by Brazilian insurers. 
Brazilian importers must obtain cargo insurance from 
insurance firms resident in Brazil, although the firms may 
be foreign-owned. 
 
Banking and Other Financial Services 
 
Brazil has not ratified the WTO Financial Services 
Agreement, formally known as the Fifth Protocol to the 
GATS, which is necessary to bring Brazil\'s commitments 
under the Agreement into force. The Financial Services 
Agreement is still pending approval in the Brazilian 
Congress.  U.S. service exports to Brazil are impeded by 
restrictive investment laws, lack of transparency in 
administrative procedures, legal and administrative 
restrictions on remittances and sometimes arbitrary 
application of regulations. Service trade opportunities in 
some sectors have been affected by limitations on foreign 
capital participation. 
 
In negotiating the 1997 WTO Financial Services Agreement, 
Brazil made commitments in almost all service sub-sectors 
for non-insurance financial services, including banking 
and securities services.    Brazil\'s constitution 
precludes the expansion of foreign-owned banks until new 
financial sector legislation is issued.  For practical 
reasons, new legislation has not been issued, but the 
President of Brazil has the authority to authorize new 
foreign participants on a case-by-case basis. In practice, 
Brazil has approved most plans by foreign service 
suppliers to enter the market or expand existing 
operations.  As of December 2002, foreign-owned or 
controlled assets accounted for one third of Brazil\'s 
total financial sector equity, and over 18 U.S. financial 
service suppliers had established significant operations 
in Brazil. 
 
During 2002, a U.S. company involved in credit bureau 
activities raised national treatment concerns regarding 
the refusal by Receita Federal, Brazil\'s internal revenue 
service, to provide it with information that was being 
obtained by its local competitors. 
INVESTMENT BARRIERS 
 
In addition to restrictions discussed above, various 
prohibitions limit foreign investment in internal 
transportation, public utilities, media and other 
\"strategic industries.\"  Foreign ownership of land 
adjacent to national borders remains prohibited under 
Brazilian law, unless approved by the National Security 
Council.  Despite investment restrictions, U.S. and other 
foreign firms have major investments in Brazil, with the 
U.S. accounting for more than one third of total foreign 
investment.  There is no Bilateral Investment Treaty 
between the United States and Brazil.

Classified By: POLOFF RICHARD REITER FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D. 
 
1. (SBU)  SUMMARY.  Thirteen months into his term, Brazilian 
President Lula da Silva on January 23 announced his 
long-awaited first cabinet shuffle.  The changes affect 
twelve of 35 cabinet posts and address all three of Lula\'s 
goals:  bringing the PMDB party officially into the governing 
coalition, replacing weak performers and streamlining the 
social assistance portfolios, and improving the workflow in 
the Presidency.  Key changes include bringing the coalition\'s 
floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies, Aldo Rebelo, into 
Lula\'s office as the newly-created Minister of Political 
Coordination --taking some weight off Chief-of-Staff Jose 
Dirceu; and creating a new unified Social Development 
Ministry headed by Federal Deputy Patrus Ananias (meaning 
Zero Hunger chief Jose Graziano and Social Assistance 
Minister Benedita da Silva will lose their jobs).  The PMDB 
will get two ministries as it has long demanded --settling on 
Social Security and Communications.  This shakeup should 
smooth the administration\'s ability to pass legislation and 
carry out the social assistance programs expected to be at 
the heart of the coming year\'s political agenda.  (Full 
cabinet list is at paras 8-9.)  END SUMMARY. 
 
PMDB GETS COMMUNICATIONS AND SOCIAL SECURITY 
-------------------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) The wait is over (ref A).  President Lula announced 
his cabinet shuffle on January 23, thirteen months into his 
administration --the longest any modern Brazilian 
administration has gone without cabinet changes.  The first 
goal was to cement the large centrist PMDB party in the 
governing coalition.  The PMDB has been an ally of Lula\'s 
Workers\' Party (PT) since May, and it has clamored for 
cabinet slots to reflect its size (78 Deputies and 23 
Senators).  Weeks of painfully public negotiations yielded up 
two ministries.  PMDB Federal Deputy Eunicio Oliveira from 
Ceara will take over the Communications Ministry, while 
Senator Amir Lando of Rondonia will become Minister of Social 
Security.  Social Security is a big-budget portfolio, but 
with most of the money earmarked there is little room for 
creativity --no doubt what Lula had in mind.  The heavy 
lifting on passing pension reforms has already been done, so 
Lando\'s role will be to implement the changes.  In addition, 
the PMDB will also get to name the head of the Postal 
Service. 
 
SOCIAL PORTFOLIOS STREAMLINED 
----------------------------- 
3. (C) The second goal was to weed out underperformers and 
streamline the social portfolios.  After spending 2003 
focused on fiscal austerity and reforms, Lula is now expected 
to turn his attention to education, employment, and poverty 
alleviation.  To that end, longtime Lula friends Jose 
Graziano (Minister of Food Security and head of the \"Zero 
Hunger\" program) and Benedita da Silva (Minister of Social 
Assistance) --both of whom have been criticized for weak 
performances and assorted gaffes-- will lose their jobs. 
Federal Deputy Patrus Ananias, a PT stalwart and former mayor 
of Belo Horizonte (Brazil\'s third largest city) will head the 
new Ministry of Social Development that will merge the 
portfolios of Benedita and Graziano as well as programs 
consolidated under the Presidency in October (ref B).  A PT 
Deputy commented approvingly to us that Ananias is 
well-respected, low key, and has executive experience.  The 
Deputy also noted that Lula feels personally committed to 
both Graziano and Benedita, and that Graziano is mulling an 
offer to remain as an \"advisor\" while Benedita, a PT icon, 
may go back and run for the Rio city council in October\'s 
elections. 
 
ALDO REBELO MOVES TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
----------------------------------------- 
4. (C) Federal Deputy Aldo Rebelo (PCdoB-Sao Paulo) will move 
into Lula\'s office, relieving Chief-of-Staff Jose Dirceu of 
some of his duties.  Rebelo will get cabinet rank as 
\"Secretary of Political Coordination and Institutional 
Affairs\", with responsibility to coordinate the 
administration\'s projects with Congress, governors, mayors, 
and the judiciary.  The overworked Dirceu is unlikely to lose 
real authority, though he will be freed to focus on internal 
administration affairs.  Rebelo, a leading moderate in the 
Communist Party of Brazil in his fourth Congressional term, 
is widely-praised for his consensus-building over the past 
year as the coalition\'s floor leader.  The leading candidate 
to take over that post is Miro Texeira, who was forced out as 
Minister of Communications because his PDT party pulled out 
of Lula\'s coalition last month.  Texeira will take up the 
Chamber seat (from Rio de Janeiro) to which he was elected in 
2002.  Texeira has now left the PDT to sign on with the PT, 
and in his January 23 announcement, Lula endorsed him for 
coalition floor leader. 
 
DOMINOS FALL AT LABOR, CDES, EDUCATION, AND SCIENCE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
5. (SBU) The fact of PMDB Senator Amir Lando\'s replacing 
Ricardo Berzoini at Social Security created a domino effect, 
as Lula was intent on keeping Berzoini in the cabinet.  As a 
result, Berzoini will replace Jaques Wagner as Minister of 
Labor, Wagner will replace Tarso Genro as head of the Council 
for Economic and Social Development (a public-private talk 
shop attached to the Presidency), and Tarso Genro moves to 
the Ministry of Education, replacing Cristovam Buarque, one 
of the \"academics\" who lost Lula\'s confidence. (Lula was 
quoted saying he wants fewer \"academics writing theses\" and 
more concrete results in the coming year.) 
 
6. (C) Another unhappy minister will be replaced at Science 
and Technology, as Federal Deputy Eduardo Campos replaces 
Roberto Amaral.  In addition to his weak performance and 
verbal gaffes, Amaral was linked to a faction of the PSB 
party that recently lost an internal power struggle.  Campos, 
38, grandson of the party\'s founder, legendary leftist Miguel 
Arraes, was on the winning side and so gets the party\'s 
cabinet post.  (One unimpressed PT politician told us Campos 
is a \"professional grandson\" who has accomplished little in 
his nine years in Congress.)  Finally, Nilceia Freire, Rector 
of the State University of Rio de Janeiro and best-known for 
introducing minority admissions quotas there, takes over from 
Emilia Fernandes as Secretary for Women\'s Affairs, the 
smallest-budget post in the cabinet. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. (C)  There is palpable relief that the shuffle is done. 
The process has been grindingly slow and emotionally taxing 
for Lula, who felt great anguish at having to give longtime 
colleagues the axe.  Over the past five months, the constant 
begging from the PMDB and the unhappy existences of lame-duck 
Ministers had become major distractions.  In the end, Lula 
addressed his obvious needs, and (aside from the odd 
four-ministry domino effect designed to keep Ricardo Berzoini 
in the cabinet) much of the public speculation was borne out. 
 Lula keeps intact his well-regarded economic team as well as 
his closest group of advisers (the so-called \"hard core\" of 
Dirceu, Gushiken, Dulci, and Palocci).  With three leading 
Deputies and a Senator moving from Congress to the cabinet, 
there will also be repercussions in the congressional and 
party leaderships.  Overall, the cabinet shakeup is 
promising.  Satisfying the PMDB (and bringing Aldo Rebelo 
onto Lula\'s staff) should ease the government\'s ability to 
pass legislation, while unifying the social affairs 
portfolios recognizes the need for a single point of contact 
as Lula turns his attention to the country\'s poor and 
unemployed. 
 
 
LULA\'S NEW CABINET

SUBJECT:  BRAZILIAN FEDERAL DEPUTIES DISCUSS PIRACY WITH GAO 
 
Refs:  A) 2003 Sao Paulo 2199  B) 2003 Brasilia 3868 
 
1.  (U) This is an action request - see para 9. 
 
2.  (U) Summary:  Members of Brazil\'s Federal Chamber\'s 
Investigative Commission (CPI) on Piracy briefed visitors from 
the U.S. General Accounting Office and Emboffs on January 20. 
Describing the work of the CPI and the extent of the piracy 
problem in Brazil, the federal deputies expressed their 
appreciation of the interest of the U.S. Congress in this issue 
and signaled their desire for further consultations in 
Washington.  Biopiracy, threats to health and safety, raising 
public consciousness and addressing the root causes of piracy 
were among the issues covered.  The CPI is making preparations 
for drafting its final report (expected in June), planning town 
hall meetings in several cities to engage the public as well as 
a working group session with private-sector representatives 
next week in Brasilia. End Summary. 
 
3.  (SBU) Just returning from the holidays to an extraordinary 
session of the Congress called by the President, Brazilian 
Federal Deputy Luiz Medeiros (PL-SP), met with visitors from 
the U.S. General Accounting Office and Emboffs on January 20. 
Medeiros presided over an hour-long session that included 
expositions from other CPI members on subjects ranging from 
biopiracy to China, questions and answers from the GAO team, 
and his own vignettes from investigations. He began the meeting 
by extolling the CPI\'s work and reputation.  He recognized that 
piracy in Brazil is intimately linked with corruption, 
organized crime and the drug trade, citing the case of three 
shopping centers selling pirated goods in Sao Paulo, owned and 
operated by the Chinese mafia, that were temporarily shut down 
last month through the efforts of the CPI and enforcement 
officials (see ref A). 
 
4.  (SBU) Medeiros also highlighted the negative consequences 
of piracy on economic development as evinced in the case of a 
Toshiba factory in Brazil considering closure due to the unfair 
competition from contraband and pirates.  According to 
Medeiros, police discovered a factory assembling Toshiba laptop 
look-a-likes with used contraband computer parts, posing as a 
computer repair shop.  Before police could initiate an 
investigation and raid, a federal judge intervened attesting to 
the legitimacy of the repair shop.  The CPI later discovered 
that the judge in question was himself under investigation in 
Operation Anaconda, a wide-ranging Federal Police corruption 
investigation.  More than simply a question of tax evasion, job 
losses and trampled intellectual property rights, pirated, 
often sub-standard, goods such as medicines and auto-parts 
present a real threat to the health and safety of Brazilians, 
he said. 
 
5.  (SBU) The extension of the CPI until June 2004 and the 
formation of a Congressional caucus (\"Frente Parlamentar\" in 
Portuguese) devoted to the issue of piracy and tax evasion 
evidenced the strong public support of the CPI\'s work, 
according to Medeiros.  Therefore, the CPI has an obligation to 
provide realistic proposals for improving the situation. 
Toward that end, the CPI has maintained a very open atmosphere, 
seeking input from the private sector, law enforcement 
officials, and the judiciary.  While the CPI has supported 
public awareness campaigns, such as the Anti-Piracy Day 
activities (see ref B) Medeiros told us that CPI wants to 
involve the general public in formulating its report. 
Depending on the availability of funding, the CPI hopes to hold 
several town-hall meetings in large cities around the country 
to get feedback from Brazilian citizens on how to effectively 
combat piracy.  He invited Emboff to participate in a working 
group session with private sector representatives to be held in 
Brasilia February 4.  Medeiros, however, noted the absence of 
contact from the Interministerial Committee to Combat Piracy 
(CICP), the executive body formed by the GoB in 2001, although 
he made no mention of inviting input from the CICP. He said 
that the CPI would seek modifications to the CICP, but did not 
elaborate further. 
 
6. (SBU) Approximately 10 deputies on the CPI joined the 
discussion, many praising the U.S. Congress\'s interest in their 
legislative effort to address piracy. Deputy Sarney-Filho (PV- 
MA), a former Minister of Environment, stressed the need for a 
wider vision of the problem to include biopiracy and 
trafficking in protected species.  Sarney-Filho encouraged 
Brazil\'s support for transnational legislation to address 
piracy in all of its forms.  Other deputies spoke of the 
difficulties enforcement officials face with minimal resources, 
inadequate laws (for example, the requirement for indefinite 
storage of seized goods), and at times an unsupportive 
judiciary.  They asked for information on U.S. legislation and 
procedures regarding seizures and targeted customs inspections. 
Vanessa Grazziotin (PCdoB-AM) noted that China receives more 
than its fair share of criticism as a supplier of pirated goods 
to the world, saying other Asian and East European countries 
merit investigation as well.  She spoke of the difficulty 
customs inspectors faced in differentiating between simply 
contraband goods and pirated goods.  Recognizing that poverty 
plays a significant role in Brazil\'s piracy problem, deputies 
discussed the merits of seeking ways to increase the cost of 
pirated goods as well as lower the cost of legitimate products. 
 
Comment 
------- 
7. (SBU)  The CPI members clearly stated their desire to 
produce a useful and relevant document, and to have a long-term 
impact on the Federal Government\'s treatment of the piracy 
issue.  They are cognizant of the difficulties ahead, including 
the five-month timeframe in which they must complete their 
work.  The CPI has thus far managed to avoid becoming 
politicized.  Engaging the general public as fully as they have 
engaged the private sector will assist in producing a balanced 
set of proposals and lessen the possibility that the final 
report is perceived as primarily pro-private sector to the 
detriment of the larger Brazilian populace. 
 
8.  (U) The CPI is working to keep the issue in the spotlight. 
Since the beginning of the year, the \"Estado de Sao Paulo\" 
newspaper, with the country\'s second-largest circulation, has 
published at least two articles featuring the Association for 
Protection of Intellectual Property (ADEPI) and the CPI.  One 
editorial cited the \"real possibility\" of U.S.-applied 
commercial sanctions against Brazil due to the country\'s 
failure to effectively combat piracy, a reference to the GSP 
review of last October.  A recent RadioBras (Brazil\'s National 
Radio) report featured the CPI and the Interministerial 
Committee as two of the main fronts in the fight against 
piracy, working to educate and protect the Brazilian public. 
Maintaining this positive momentum after the CPI\'s closure will 
be a challenge, an issue likely to be addressed by private 
sector representatives at the February 4 working group session 
with the CPI. 
 
9.  (SBU) Meeting with members of the U.S. Congress active on 
piracy issues is high on the CPI\'s agenda, and may in part 
explain their willingness to meet with us at such an 
inopportune time.  IPR trade associations are working to 
organize a Brazilian legislators\' visit to the U.S. in late 
March, one aim being meetings with members of Congress\'s two 
Piracy/IPR caucuses.  Mission strongly recommends that the 
Department facilitate such meetings and looks forward to 
communicating details of the visit through the appropriate 
point of contact in the Legislative Affairs Bureau as soon as 
they are available.

SUBJECT:  ANATEL COUNTERS SPECULATION ON TELECOM MERGER 
 
REFS: (A) BRASILIA 59,(B) BRASILIA 38,(C) 03 BRASILIA 3405 
 
1.  A barrage of Brazilian press articles have speculated 
that President Lula dismissed National Telecommunications 
Agency (ANATEL) President Schymura in large part due to the 
latter\'s insistence that Brazil\'s three regional fixed-line 
local telephone service giants be blocked from buying 
Embratel, the long-distance carrier being sold by MCI (Ref 
B).  The last such article appeared in the January 28 
addition of daily \'O Globo\', which speculated that Telemar, 
Telefonica, and Brazil Telecom would now be allowed to buy 
Embratel, extending their local monopoly into the long- 
distance market and thereby squelching foreign investment. 
Attorneys and an engineer from ANATEL\'s competition division 
categorically denied such press speculation during a January 
28 meeting with Econoff and asserted that the proposed 
Embratel purchase is illegal under current law. 
 
2.  Jose Goncalves Neto, General Manager of Competition, an 
engineer who has been with ANATEL since its 1997 formation, 
commented that, despite all of the conjecture, the merger as 
proposed is contrary to Brazilian law and could not occur 
without congressional approval of a change in the law.  He 
predicted such a change would be unlikely.  The ANATEL 
competition specialists have recommended breaking Embratel 
into two separate companies; one regulated company of 
telephonic services, and an unregulated company which would 
consist of Internet services. 
 
3.  Neto added that ANATEL was patterned from the U.S. 
Federal Communications Commission and that it looks to the 
U.S. model for inspiration.  The FCC does not have a role in 
Internet regulation, and ANATEL would like to discontinue 
regulation of these services.  Naturally, the move would 
also open more competition to vie for the two newly created 
companies, since the value of the two entities would be less 
than the current valuation of Embratel. 
 
4.  Neto debunked press reports that Schymura\'s public 
opposition to the fixed-line carriers\' bid for Embratel was 
the main driver behind his being forced out as president of 
ANATEL.  Neto opined that the issue was only a minor part of 
Schymura\'s problems, citing political factors as the main 
contributors.  These factors included Lula\'s desire to 
recompense Communication Minister Miro Teixeira for his 
removal as minister by placing Teixeira\'s close ally Ziller 
in the ANATEL presidency, as well as the Minister\'s vehement 
disagreement with ANATEL\'s tariff increase in 2003 (Teixeira 
encouraged the consumer\'s lawsuit against ANATEL to roll 
back the tariff increase), what the Ministry perceived as 
slow movement on regulatory decisions, and the worrisome 
exit of some foreign investors (U.S. corporations divesting 
from Brazil\'s telecomm sector since privatization in 1996 
include ATT, BellSouth, QUALCOMM, as well as MCI\'s stated 
intention to sell Embratel). 
 
5.  Comment:  It would seem ironic that Neto\'s list of 
Schymura\'s shortcomings included concern over foreign 
divestment, given the uncertainty over the stability of the 
regulatory regimes that the GoB\'s own actions -- including 
the Schymura firing--have generated (Ref C).  Ziller\'s 
appointment, to the extent that it smoothes the working 
relationship between the Ministry and ANATEL, could reduce 
bureaucratic tension and uncertainty, but he has not yet

1.  Post provides the following in response to ref B request. 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  Biotechnology in Brazil is regulated by the 1995 Biosafety 
Law 8.974 that established a government commission (CTNBio) to 
approve genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  While the 1995 
GMO Biosafety Law remains on the books, regulation of the 
biotechnology sector in Brazil has remained essentially frozen 
because of a 1998 court case that is still pending in a federal 
court in Brasilia filed by environmental NGOs against the use 
of Monsanto\'s Roundup Ready soybean variety.  This complicated 
case addresses not only the requirement to conduct 
environmental impact studies on GMO products, but also the 
constitutional authority of CTNBio to approve biotech products. 
 
3.  In the absence of a definitive court ruling in that case or 
the passage of the new Biosafety Law, President Lula after 
taking office on January 1, 2003 issued two Presidential 
Decrees (both later adopted into law by Congress) that 
respectively legalized the 2002-03 and 2003-04 biotech soybean 
crops.  On October 31, 2003, President Lula sent to Congress a 
draft of the long-awaited Biosecurity Law that will provide a 
long-term regulatory regime for the biotech sector.  The text 
of the bill from the Presidency envisions a complicated 
mechanism for approval of biotech products by a national 
biosafety council attached to the Presidency that would 
consider political and economic, as well as scientific factors. 
On February 5, 2004, the bill was approved with certain 
revisions by the Chamber of Deputies and proceeded to the 
Senate where it is expected to be debated for several weeks. 
Assessments of the bill as passed vary considerably.  Post 
provides the following information in the interim and will 
continue to follow and report on the progress of biotech 
legislation in Brazil.  End summary. 
 
Relevant Laws and Regulation 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  Law 8.974 of 1995 - GMO Biosafety Law - Determines the 
standards for using genetic engineering techniques and the 
release of genetically-modified organisms into the 
environment; 
 
Provisional Measure 2191-9 of 2001 - Modifies and creates 
provisions to Law 8.974/95; 
 
Decree 1.752 of 1995 - Regulates Law 8.974/95; 
 
Law 10.165 of 2000 - Classifies all GMO activities as 
potentially harmful to the environment, for taxing purposes; 
 
CONAMA Resolution 305 of 2002 - Provides for Licensing and 
Environmental Impact Study and Report (EIA/RIMA) to GMO 
enterprises; 
 
Law 7.802 of 1989 - Pesticide Law - Determines registration 
of biocide products with federal agencies. Given this 
requirement, any biocide GMOs, such as the BT Corn, shall be 
registered as pesticides; 
 
Decree 4.680 of 2003 - Regulates Labeling of GMO Food and Food 
Ingredients. 
 
Specific Rules for Genetically Modified Soybean 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  Law 10.688 of June 13, 2003 (Provisional Measure 113) - 
Determines the standards for marketing the soybean produced 
in the 2003 harvest and creates labeling requirements; 
Law 10.814 of December 15, 2003 (Provisional Measure 131) - 
Determines the standards for planting and marketing 
genetically modified soybean produced in the 2004 harvest. 
Makes GM soybean planting and marketing subject to the 
signature, by the producer, of a TCRAC document (statement 
of commitment, responsibility and conduct); 
 
Decree 4.846 of September 25, 2003 - Regulates Law 10.814 
concerning the TCRAC document; 
 
Law 10.688 (MP 113) of 2003, authorizing the marketing of 
soybean produced in the 2003 harvest, clearly containing 
transgenic material, and Law 10.814 (MP 131) of 2003, 
authorizing producers that had withheld grain from the 
previous harvest to grow transgenic soybean in 2004 as long 
as a Statement of Commitment is signed, are of exceptional 
and non-final character concerning the authorization of GMO 
commercial production in the country. According to Law 
10.814 of 2003, soybean planting for 2005 shall comply with 
the legislation in force at that time.  By converting MP 131 
into Law 10.814 of 2003, a provision was created authorizing 
registration of GM seeds in the National Register of 
Cultivars of the Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA). Another 
provision gave amnesty to soybean producers that had failed 
to comply with the Biosafety Law in the previous harvests. 
 
Bill 2401/2003 
-------------- 
6.  Designed to replace Law 8.974 of 1995 and permanently 
regulate GMO activity in the country, including the 
competency of several government agencies, the President 
forwarded bill 2401/2003 to the Congress in October.  Under 
this bill, CTNBio is preserved as a joint committee to 
evaluate GMO-related issues. However, its technical opinion 
will be binding only when negative. In case of a positive 
opinion, voting is analyzed (or reviewed) by registration 
and inspection agencies from MAPA, MS and MMA, within the 
scope of their competencies. CTNBio would have 26 members, 
of which 10 scientists and 16 Government and civil society 
representatives, a restructuring that gives greater weight 
to non-scientists. 
 
7.  The bill creates the National Biosafety Council (CNBS), 
linked to the Presidency of the Republic, with the 
responsibility of setting the principles and guidelines for 
implementing biotech policies as well as making the final 
decision on approvals of authorization requests concerning 
GMOs, including marketing and research.  This bill already 
has 278 proposed amendments and will undergo significant 
modifications, especially concerning the competencies and 
composition of CTNBio and CNBS.  Congress passed the bill 
with modifications on February 5, 2004, and the bill 
proceeded to the Senate for further debate. 
 
Monitoring and Enforcement under the 1995 BioSafety Law 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
8.  The regulatory process in place for approving products 
of agricultural biotechnology for import or sale is laid out 
in the 1995 Biosafety Law (Law 8974 of January 1995) and the 
follow-on Presidential Decrees 1752 of 1995 and 2191-9 of 
2001.  Together, these created a regulatory framework and 
established CTNBio (\"National Technical Commission for 
Biosafety\"), granting it wide authority to evaluate, 
approve, and regulate GMOs based on scientific criteria for 
consumer and environmental safety.  CTNBio is attached to 
the Ministry of Science and Technology.  There is no blanket 
legal prohibition on the use, importation or sale of GMOs in 
Brazil, but no approvals are currently being issued due to 
the pending court case, with the exception of animal feed 
products. 
9.  Under the 1995 law, those wishing to import or sell 
biotech products must receive approval from CTNBio and 
authorization to market from one of three regulatory 
agencies under the Ministry of Health, Agriculture or 
Environment depending on the nature of the product. 
Monsanto\'s Roundup Ready Soy was the first biotech product 
to receive CTNBio approval in 1998, and the subsequent court 
case and injunction effectively halted further biotech 
projects in Brazil. Thus, monitoring and enforcement has 
never been exercised, as the mandate of the competent 
authorities (CTNBio) has not been secured.  In the interim, 
only a few Embrapa biotech research projects have been 
approved through the Ministry of Environment. The Ministry 
of Agriculture has granted limited approval for biotech 
products for use as animal feed, such as corn from Argentina 
for poultry producers in the northeast of Brazil.  However, 
entry of these products has always been obtained through 
court injunction. 
 
10.  No testing system for biotech content of shipments of 
agricultural products existed under the 1995 law.  The GoB 
is not seriously contemplating a traceability system at this 
time. 
 
Labeling requirements 
--------------------- 
 
11.  Executive Order Number 4,680 applies to all biotech 
products to be marketed in Brazil and establishes, as per 
article 2, a one-percent limit tolerance level for genetically 
modified organisms in bulk products, foods and by-products for 
human or animal consumption.  It also allows the CTNBio the 
prerogative to change the percentage referred in article 2 on a 
case-by-case basis.  The order states that the lack of 
compliance will entail the penalties foreseen in the Code of 
Consumer Defense and other applicable rules. 
 
12.  For packaged products or those sold in bulk or in natura 
(raw), the following wording must appear on the front of the 
label in conjunction with the approved GMO logo (a large black 
\"T\" inside of a yellow triangle):  \"(name of product) 
transgenic\", containing (name of the ingredient or ingredients 
transgenic (s)\"or \"product produced with (name of product) 
transgenic\".  The order also requires that the consumer be 
informed of the specie of the donor gene in the place reserved 
for the identification of the ingredients.  All of the label 
biotech information on the label must also appear on the 
invoice so that it can follow the product or ingredient in all 
steps of the productive chain. 
 
13.  The food and ingredients produced from animals fed with 
feed containing transgenic ingredients must have labels printed 
on the front panel with the following wording:  \"(name of 
animal\") fed with feed containing transgenic ingredients\" or 
\"(name of ingredient) produced from animal fed with feed 
containing transgenic ingredient.\" 
 
14.  Food and food ingredients that do not contain or are not 
produced from genetically modified organisms will have earned 
the right to use the labeling \"(name of product or ingredient) 
free of transgenic\" once there are similar transgenic products 
on the Brazilian market. 
 
15.  There are special provisions for products produced from 
soybeans harvested from the 2003 crop.  The labeling 
requirements go into effect on February 26, 2004.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  Ceara state had an especially bleak economic year in 2003, 
but with better-than-ever trade trends: exports 40% up from 
2002, a record surplus, new markets, product diversity, and 
more small/medium-business activity.  State revenues shrank, 
but the budget evidently stayed well-run.  Jobs became fewer, 
and more of them shifted from the formal to the informal 
sector, as in Brazil nationally.  Lula\'s Zero Hunger initiative 
is said to be solidly established in Ceara, which has enacted a 
tax hike to fund its own new social-program initiatives.  As on 
our trips to Piaui state (Refs C, D), we got the impression 
that Lula\'s exhortations have boosted efforts at social-relief 
programs, even without new resources from the GoB.  Conversely, 
officials confided that PPPs (Private-Public Partnerships, the 
GoB\'s hope for inducing private-sector investment in 
infrastructure) will not be viable in their swathe of Brazil\'s 
impoverished Northeast.  As for tax reform: if Ceara\'s attitude 
is indicative, the GoB\'s proposal to simplify Brazil\'s basic 
ICMS tax into five national tiers (depriving states of the 
authority to set their own ICMS rates) won\'t soon pass. 
Exports to the U.S., Ceara\'s top foreign market for 60 years, 
rose in absolute terms to USD 307 million (traditional cashews 
and crustaceans, plus footwear, leather, \"other,\" and even 
cotton), but have dropped from a 1999 peak of 54% to just 40% 
of the 2003 overall total.  We found Ceara sentiment in favor 
of an FTAA to be strong, but also unbelieving.  The U.S. shrimp 
anti-dumping petition was of great local concern. 
 
2.  Ceara shows the possibilities -- but also the hard limits - 
- of what can be accomplished by local government within 
Brazil\'s federal structure.  On an all-Brazil scale, it may 
seem puny (two percent of the nation\'s area, four percent of 
population, under two percent of GDP and, even after 1991-2001 
export growth, just one percent of exports.)  But Ceara also 
looks set to stay in Brazil\'s pragmatic, progressive, 
enterprising, trade-oriented and U.S.-friendly avant-garde.  It 
merits and should reward greater long-term U.S. cultivation.

(END SUMMARY.) 
 
Recession, Job Losses, State Budget 
----------------------------------- 
3.  EconCouns re-visited Ceara state (147,000 square km, 7.5 
million people) in Brazil\'s poverty-plagued Northeast January 
19-21, meeting with state-government secretaries for Finance, 
Development, and Social Programs, the local Industry Chamber, 
private-sector executives and others.  All locals said 2003 had 
been the toughest in memory for Ceara\'s economy.  Its official 
growth figure was worse (-0.5%) than Brazil\'s preliminary 
national result (+0.3%), despite a record agricultural harvest. 
Recorded joblessness was up, and behind the official employment 
rate lies the pernicious growth trend of informal (now 51% in 
Ceara, it was said) vs. formal labor, as in Brazil nationally. 
Moreover, most informal-job growth has been in the commercial 
and services sectors, which the state computes is now \"close to 
its saturation limit,\" said Development Secretary Regis Dias. 
 
4.  Finance Secretary Jose Mendes told us the state had had to 
cut public investment by 127 million Reals from a total budget 
of under six billion in 2003.  January-September revenues were 
down almost 10%, year-on-year.  Asked what percentage of the 
state budget was discretionary, he and his specialists did not 
know, and unconvincingly guessed \"20-22%\".  But they eagerly 
reassured that, with regard to Ceara\'s state finances, all 
prime indicators (e.g., debt-to-revenue ratio; payroll share of 
the state budget) remain far below the ceilings allowed by the 
GoB\'s May 2000 Law of Fiscal Responsibility. 
 
5.  All lauded the GoB\'s success in stabilizing macroeconomic 
conditions in 2003, and were warily hopeful that it would 
produce growth in 2004.  But on the micro-level they were 
dubious, based on state household surveys, that revived local 
consumption could spark any economic upswing.  Last year\'s drop 
in the Central Bank\'s main interest rate seems to hold scant 
meaning for business in Ceara. 
 
Social Welfare and Programs 
--------------------------- 
6.  We asked about social needs and programs.  In particular: 
how has the `Zero Hunger\' initiative, now subsumed into the 
`Family Stipend,\' of Lula\'s GoB impacted at state level? 
Social Affairs Secretary Raimundo de Matos replied that state 
social outlays burgeoned in 2003 from 28 million per month in 
2002 to 47 million, recession having increased the number of 
needy.  `Zero Hunger\' has been installed in 174 of Ceara\'s 184 
municipalities.  Payment goes smoothly via electronic cards, 
realized in Caixa-Bank or post-office branches -- failing that, 
in national lottery-ticket outlets.  Between them, these three 
outlets evidently cover every boondock in Brazil.  We learned 
that since last April, local-level management of `Zero Hunger\' 
nation-wide has been via nine-person committees, with worker, 
church, mayoral and state-government representatives. 
 
7.  Secretary De Matos had ready figures for the numbers of 
families registered in the specific programs now being combined 
into Lula\'s national `Family Stipend.\'  In all, 1.4 million 
families benefit from some aspect of the social-safety net. 
Old problems with the national \"Cadastro Unico\" registry have 
been largely resolved, he said without elaboration.  Phones, 
fax and other hardware are the main needs now for social- 
program implementation, according to De Matos. 
 
8.  Officials freely referred to Ceara being Brazil\'s third- 
poorest state, behind Maranhao and Piaui.  Forty-five percent 
of its 7.5 million population are deemed below the poverty 
line, defined as less than one-third of the national minimum 
wage per capita (i.e., 80 Reals/USD 27 per month.)  This 
poverty is disproportionately present among the 55% of Ceara\'s 
denizens in the state\'s interior, away from its 100-kilometer 
deep coastal fringe (which generally escapes the droughts that 
curse the hinterland), Fortaleza and eleven other main cities. 
 
9.  Ceara has its own relief initiatives.  At the end of 2003, 
new governor Alcantara pressed through the legislature a tax 
increase adding two percent to the existing ICMS tax rate on 
various products, as of February 1, 2004, for the `Fund to 
Combat Poverty.\'  This tax hike was in the teeth of business 
opposition, all officials cheerfully volunteered.  (NOTE: 
Eloquent of the political will involved in this step is the 
fact that Ceara\'s modern repute for being a relative model of 
Brazilian progressive governance is linked to the activism of 
local business circles since 1973; Ref F.  END NOTE.) 
 
10.  The new revenues, projected at 90-100 million Reals (USD 
35 million) yearly, are earmarked for what state officials call 
\"parallel social development.\"  Namely, while `Bolsa Familia\' 
tides poor families through current difficulties, the `Poverty 
Fund\' is to shore up training, jobs and infrastructure for long- 
term self-sufficiency.  Each of Ceara\'s municipalities is to 
have a \"House of the Family,\" linked with existing offices for 
promoting family agriculture.  Projects are to be managed by 
citizens\' committees. 
 
Ceara to Brasilia on Tax Reform:  No Dice 
----------------------------------------- 
11.  We asked about views of the Lula administration\'s national 
tax reform: in particular, its goal of removing states\' power 
to set their own rates for the basic ICMS tax (Ref B).  Ceara 
has been as aggressive as any state in using this power to 
attract or poach industries from abroad or from Brazil\'s south 
(Ref E).  Under what assurances might it cease to resist the 
GoB\'s plan to unify the ICMS rates into five national levels? 
 
12.  Finance Secretary Jose Martins\' initial answer was opaque. 
He drew a distinction (totally lost on EconCouns) between a 
state setting a preferential ICMS level and granting \"fiscal 
exemptions.\"  But he then said outright that the GoB\'s proposal 
to form regional development funds to compensate states for the 
ICMS reform was unacceptable.  Disposition of such funds \"would 
be permanently in the hands of Sao Paulo and Brazil\'s 
industrialized south.\"  This would wreck Ceara\'s prospects to 
induce foreign investment, \"and without foreign investment, 
whole sectors of Ceara\'s economy would (already) have lost 
competitiveness and be extinct.\"  Other interlocutors echoed 
this sentiment.  Bottom line:  officials avoided confirming 
that Ceara would oppose ICMS reform, but no other logical 
conclusion was possible.  (NOTE: Former Governor, now Senator, 
Tasso Jereissati has become one of Congress\'s key figures in 
the GoB\'s tax-reform campaign and was instrumental in putting 
off the ICMS issue at the end of 2003.  END NOTE.) 
 
13.  What about another aspect of the GoB\'s tax-reform debate: 
the suggestion to ease constitutionally-mandated state outlays 
on health and education?  Secretary Mendes said that item was 
now off the GoB tax-reform table.  However, he expected it to 
transpire inevitably in the longer term.  In his words, \"the 
GoB Ministries of Health and Education have disappeared from 
Brazil\'s states,\" their mandates being transferred to state and 
municipal government.  Ceara now spends 27-28% of its revenues 
on health, 10-11% on education. 
 
Policy Imperative:  Hinterland Development 
------------------------------------------ 
14.  Officials\' supreme theme was the need to staunch migration 
from Ceara\'s interior to its urban littoral.  Time after time, 
they spoke of preempting this \"irreversible\" process with all 
its sociopathic effects.  Hence the state\'s core strategy of 
fostering interior \"poles of development.\"  Development 
Secretary Dias described the Nike factory with 1,500 workers, 
 
SIPDIS 
300 kilometers from Fortaleza, and of the micro-businesses 
(\"even a bicycle dealership!\") that have grown up around it. 
Only by being able to implant such industrial reefs can 
Brazil\'s Northeastern states abate socio-economic migration to 
urban favelas, was the ubiquitous view. 
 
15.  Planting new factories inland is a pre-condition to this 
end, but the over-arching aim is to make/keep family 
agriculture viable.  In this regard, Ceara\'s huge-scale \"Road 
of Waters\" irrigation project, a series of dams, reservoirs and 
linking canals designed to end the region\'s being prey to fatal 
droughts (Ref F, Para 7) seems a scant-told story of much 
import.  (COMMENT:  Indeed, Northeast rural conditions 
illuminate why the goal of bolstering family farming ranks so 
high in current Brazilian policy formulation at all levels -- 
with all that may imply for GoB attitudes on FTAA negotiations. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
16.  What about the GoB\'s PPP initiative (Public-Private 
Partnership, the mechanism whereby Lula\'s GoB wishes to induce 
private investment in infrastructure projects)?  Finance 
Secretary Martins replied that Ceara has submitted its own 
 
SIPDIS 
state-level bill to approve rules for PPPs.  But he and others 
also said flatly that PPPs \"are not applicable\" to Ceara.  Road 
or other public-transport concessions would not be commercially 
viable: volumes of use are too low.  Official PPP ambitions in 
Ceara are for:  a convention center, a family-agriculture 
project in the large fan of land between Ceara\'s most-recently 
completed mega-dam and Pecem port; and a smelter at Pecem. 
 
17.  NOTE:  Ceara may be atypical in this respect.  Since Tasso 
Jereissati\'s first election as governor in 1986, it has already 
benefited from World Bank, Japan ExImbank, IDB etc. financing 
for new ports, roads and airport on the basis of its superior 
governance record.  END NOTE. 
 
18.  COMMENT:  Ceara has been governed for almost two decades 
by the PSDB, which at the national level opposes Lula; yet in 
all our meetings there was no hint of negative assessment of 
Lula\'s PT administration -- even of shortcomings linked with 
Zero Hunger that have been raised by media throughout Brazil. 
It seemed officials could not have been more positive if they 
had been PT themselves.  At worst, Finance Minister Mendes 
volunteered his worry that Lula\'s national administration \"may 
simply not have a design or measures for projecting longer-term 
growth.\"  Media cavils aside, it seems Lula\'s national standing 
does not yet admit of political attack.  END COMMENT. 
 
The Good News:  Spectacularly Booming Trade 
------------------------------------------- 
19.  General recession notwithstanding, Ceara\'s decade-old 
export boom actually accelerated in 2003.  Exports rose 40%, 
almost double Brazil\'s national increase of 21%, to USD 761 
million.  From 1991-1999, Ceara\'s total exports averaged Reals 
340 million; the 2003 figure amounts to Reals 2.2 billion, at a 
drastically devalued exchange rate, of course.  With this jump, 
Ceara overtook Maranhao as second largest exporter of the 
Northeast\'s nine states, behind giant Bahia, which accounts for 
half the region\'s six billion-dollar total.  Coupled with a 15% 
drop in imports, it gave Ceara a trade surplus -- first since 
1993 -- of USD 220 million.  The decade\'s previous best result 
was the USD 70 million deficit/deficit of 2002.  Ceara\'s top 
sectors:  leather/footwear (33.5% of the total or $255 million 
in 2003, up 50% from 2002); textiles (16.5%, $125 million, up 
43%); \"crustaceans,\" i.e., shrimp and lobster (15.8%, $112 
million); and traditional cashews (14.7%, $112 million), which 
as late as 1998 accounted for 40% of gross exports. 
 
20.  Official and business sectors alike predicted Ceara\'s 
record will only strengthen, for three reasons:  variety of 
production; steady branching into new overseas markets; and 
increasing activity of small or medium enterprises.  The 
Industry Federation (FIEC) president noted that Ceara exports 
more than 600 individual products, and attributed the 77% 
increase in the \"Other Products\" category in 2003 mainly to 
SMEs\' activity.  The state government\'s official aim is to 
raise the export total a further 20% in 2004.  The FIEC 
president is boosting the goal of USD one billion in 2005. 
 
21.  Various contacts contrasted Ceara with Pernambuco state, 
which has a larger economy and superior human capital, health 
and education indices, but whose yearly exports are $350 
million less, and stagnant.  They ascribed their neighbors\' 
under-achievement to un-enterprising historical reliance on a 
sugar-cane economy.  Other than with recovering Argentina, 
Ceara\'s intra-Latin-American trade is negligible.  Its sights 
are set elsewhere, with particular apparent interest in Africa. 
The FIEC executive-director spoke of how a recent trade visit 
by six businessmen from Cape Verde, seen as a gateway to trade 
with West Africa (\"just four hours flight from our airport,\" we 
kept hearing) reaped a million dollars of on-the spot sales. 
 
U.S./Ceara Business 
------------------- 
22.  The U.S. has been Ceara\'s biggest market for sixty years. 
Through the late 1990s, cashews and crustaceans (shrimps and 
lobsters) accounted for 80% of all U.S. purchases, but that 
scenario has changed, footwear becoming the runner-up category 
since 1999.  Sales to the U.S. have kept increasing in absolute 
terms, but their share of Ceara\'s overall exports was down from 
its 1999 peak of 54% to 40.3% last year.  Subtotals for 2002: 
langostinos USD 38.5 million; shrimp 28.5 million; footwear USD 
66.5 million; cashew nuts USD 58.6 million (73% of all Ceara\'s 
cashew exports); leather 26.6 million (41% of all leather 
exports); \"others\" 30.4 million.  Cotton, historically the 
prize crop of Ceara\'s interior, modestly reappeared in 2003, at 
USD 7 million (80% thread, 20% fabric).  Other main foreign 
markets that year:  Argentina (6.7%); Canada (6.3); Holland, 
Spain and Italy (5.3-5.4% each).  (NOTE:  For many of the above 
categories, official state statistics vary from the local 
industry federation\'s.  END NOTE.) 
 
23.  Conversely, U.S. sales to Ceara in 2003 dropped from 
2002\'s $220 million to a more historically normal $90 million. 
Local recession, a huge electrical-generation sale in 2002, and 
the partial re-claiming by Argentina of its traditional 
Mercosul monopoly of Ceara\'s wheat market (which it temporarily 
vacated with its 2001 bankruptcy) seem the causes. 
 
24.  A February 2003 study on U.S./Ceara relations by the 
Governor\'s office calculates that from 1991 to 2002 Ceara\'s 
bilateral imports grew 482% (but see para 23 above), and its 
exports by 193%.  Other items from the study: 
 
-- From 1995 to 2001, ten U.S. companies, incl. Johnson Wax, 
Amway, and energy company ENERGISA, established operations in 
Ceara, generating 30% of Ceara\'s flow of FDI and about 2,400 
jobs; 
 
-- U.S. visitors accounted for 11% (20,000) of Ceara\'s foreign 
tourists in 2002, but have declined since the end of direct 
flights; 
 
-- The report notes its concern that Ceara\'s ports, including 
Pecem, \"may not have capacity to equip themselves with the 
machines to detect chemical and biological threats, etc, 
specified by new USG regulations, and that perishable local 
exports may thus suffer delays and loss\"; 
 
-- It also deplores the discontinuation of direct flights 
between the U.S. and Fortaleza, ascribed to the Real\'s 
devaluation since 1999. 
25.  The Governor\'s Office report ends by noting \"that the 
American Embassy in Brazil has suggested that an efficient 
mechanism to increase the economic interchange between the U.S. 
and our State would be (for). the American Department of 
Commerce to designate one of its officers assigned in Brazil to 
serve as the local promoter of US business interests in a more 
permanent basis.  Given that the Federation of Industries of 
the State of Ceara (FIEC) already hosts a NUSA office, there 
are facilities where this officer could operate.  The State 
government is looking forward to take whatever steps, within 
its scope, to make this possible.\" 
 
FTAA:  All In Favor, But Few Optimists 
-------------------------------------- 
26.  Utterances of enthusiasm for an FTAA were way up from our 
June 2002 visit and even from Ambassador\'s August 2003 visit 
(Refs E, F).  But the common view also seemed to be that the 
FTAA will be decided as if by two outside parties, i.e., the 
USG and GoB, with Ceara\'s role just that of hopeful bystander. 
Not that we heard any hint of discord with current GoB FTAA 
policy.  FIEC Executive Director, who recalls two years in 
Arizona as the best of my life\" and urged greater USDOC efforts 
to present American exports to Ceara, told us \"I agree with 
both sides on FTAA,\" i.e., that he considers both the GoB and 
USG to have bogged the process down via unreasonable 
inflexibility on the issues of most concern to the other. 
 
Shrimp Anti-Dumping 
------------------- 
27.  All were well-aware of the shrimp anti-dumping petition 
against Brazil and five other nations, the Federal Fishing 
Minister\'s January 15 call on Ambassador (Ref A), and the 
Minister\'s request that Brazil be dropped from the petition on 
grounds that Brazilian farmed shrimp are not subsidized, a hope 
widely echoed.  A subsequent January 22 item in national 
business daily `Gazeta Mercantil\' asserted that Ceara shrimp 
prices and contracts have already declined in anticipation of 
the anti-dumping case; there was no such mention during 
EconCouns\' visit.  American investors own at least two Ceara 
shrimp farms.  A single local middleman apparently dominates 
shrimp exports to the U.S. 
 
28.  The Governor\'s Office report on Ceara/U.S. economic 
relations states that the U.S. bought 80-99% of Ceara\'s shrimp 
exports from 1991-97, falling to 70% in 1999 and stabilizing at 
50% since 2001.  This, says the report, does not reflect a fall 
in North-American imports but a market diversification sought 
out by the Ceara industry.  The nine-fold increase in shrimp 
exports from 1999-2002 (sic) \"came from the growing use of 
shrimp-farming, which has allowed a dramatic expansion in 
supply as a result of high productivity and investments in 
technology.\"  In 2002, `Fish and crustaceans\' topped the list 
of Ceara\'s exports to the U.S., at USD 67.6 million, deriving 
almost entirely from sales of shrimp and langostinos.  In 
contrast to the case with shrimp, the U.S. share of Ceara\'s 
langostino exports has risen from 71% in 1991 to an average of 
95% (USD 35 million) since 1997.  The report also notes the 
U.S. Endangered Species Act and worries that if \"one 
irresponsible fisherman is caught in a wrongdoing, the entire 
Ceara fishing industry ends up being unfairly punished.\" 
 
A Little Local Politics 
----------------------- 
29.  Ceara is famed for having been a relative model of 
progressive governance under continuous PSDB administrations 
since 1986.   The PT came within a hair of capturing the Ceara 
governorship on Lula\'s coattails in the 2002 elections, 
however, and the tussle for primacy at city and state levels is 
now acute.  During our June 2002 visit, local reformers 
excoriated the Fortaleza mayor (of the rightist PMDB party) and 
voiced hope he would be turned out in 2004.  That mayor has 
since been investigated for diversion of public funds to 
campaign and personal use.  The PT believes it can gain city 
hall; rumors are it will swing with other leftist parties 
behind city councilman Inacio Arruda of the Communist Party 
(PcdoB), Lula\'s coalition partner.  Local political heavyweight 
Ciro Gomes, currently Lula\'s Minister for National Integration, 
might presumably follow suit.  Ensuing question: will PSDB ex- 
thrice-governor Tasso Jerreissati oppose the PT/Gomes candidate 
on behalf of a PSDB or PMDB alternative?  The scene is further 
complicated by Tasso\'s enmity with fellow-PSDB eminent Jose 
Serra.  Ceara politics illustrate the snarl of local dynamics 
that constrain Lula\'s efforts at national coalition-building. 
 
Other Follow-Up (Ref E, 2002 Brasilia 2932) 
------------------------------------------- 
30.  A return call on the Jandaia fruit-juice farm/factory (a 
mango, cashew and passion-fruit paradise 80 km from Fortaleza) 
revealed a new, seven-million-dollar facility under 
construction.  It will double Jandaia\'s capacity.  Of the 
increment, Jandaia aims to export 80% to expanding markets in 
Europe and the U.S.  Apart from a plan to gain various 
international certifications, the marketing strategy seemed 
unsure.  The U.S. northeast is the first prime target area. 
Russia, India, China and the Middle East are not in 
consideration for now, but the Jandaia marketing manager was 
intrigued at the notion that Russian purchasing power might 
make it a feasible, if tough, new business zone. 
 
31.  Conversely, Ceara\'s new Pecem seaport, 60 km up the coast 
from Fortaleza, evidently remains at risk of proving an 
unfinished white elephant (Ref E, Para 16).  State officials 
said the monthly number of vessel-sailings is over fifty (vs 
the reported 15-20 in June 2002), which does not seem much. 
Jandaia executives said the extra freight costs of trucking 
their containers of bottled and TetraPak juices to Pecem were 
too high to consider changing from the old port in downtown 
Fortaleza.  Oil and fuel corporations likewise all have their 
existing facilities in Fortaleza.  Asked if new state-highway 
infrastructure could supply the missing link and boost Pecem, 
Development Secretary Dias alluded to the old British-built, 
long-disused railroad into Ceara\'s interior dating back to days 
when cotton was king there -- noting that the gauge had 
purposely been different from that of the rest of Brazil, built 
to keep Ceara isolated.  A regional transport net now would 
have to start from scratch. 
 
32.  In Fortaleza itself (pop: 2.2 million), two shorefront 
hotels had been boarded-up since EconCouns\'s visits in 2002, 
and the pre-2001 hordes of Argentinian vacationers have not yet 
begun to reappear, but overall tourism levels were happily 
described as heavy, with Euro charter groups galore.  Hotel 
staff and taxi-drivers commented on the increase of domestic, 
Brazilian tourists, taking for granted that the latter\'s 
numbers are up because they have become less able to afford 
foreign holidays. 
 
33.  U.S. tourists may be fewer, but Ceara\'s cashew scene is 
gaining an American accent.  Kraft Foods/Philip Morris and

SUBJECT:  \"FOLHA\" COMMENTARY SAVAGES GOB ENERGY MODEL 
 
 
1.  The bill to establish the GoB\'s would-be new energy- 
model has been passed by the Chamber of Deputies and is now 
in the Senate committee-stage (Septel.)  Over most of the 
model\'s key detail there continues to hang a heavy fog of 
general unclarity.  Increasingly, though, private-sector and 
independent commentators are tending to pessimistic 
judgments with regard to the GoB\'s designs.  A February 1, 
2004 column in top leftist daily `Folha de Sao Paulo\' was 
representative of this growing school of thought. 
Following is Embassy\'s unofficial translation of the column. 
 
2.  (Begin Text of Unofficial Embassy Translation) 
 
HEADLINE: The Pinocchio Energy Syndrome 
 
Some statements and events that occurred in 2003 and the 
beginning of 2004 show that (Brazil\'s) energy-sector 
authorities have come down with the Pinocchio syndrome.  As 
everyone knows, Pinocchio has a personality disorder that 
prevents him from telling the truth.  With great innocence 
and charm, Pinocchio doesn\'t have the courage to stand up 
for his ideas and, consequently, loses the confidence of 
those around him. 
 
The current energy team, without the charm and less innocent 
than Pinocchio, try to fool the market and even society with 
talk that they are making changes that will assure the 
necessary investments to regain sustainable growth. 
 
In the electricity sector, at the beginning of 2003 the MME 
(Ministry of Mines and Energy) team guaranteed that the 
model proposed during the presidential campaign had been 
discarded and that, accordingly, market mechanisms and 
opinions of the agents would be considered in the 
elaboration of the new model. 
 
The first surprise came in July 2003, when the preliminary 
document was divulged.  Right away you could see that the 
\"Lula light\" philosophy had not contaminated the MME team. 
However, faced with criticisms from the market, society and 
even other areas of the government, the MME continued to say 
that the final version of the model would take into account 
all the suggestions presented.  This was because one of the 
principal objectives of the new model would be the 
attraction of private capital.  Much to our surprise, at the 
end of last year the MME sent two MPs (provisional measures) 
proposing a centralizing and state model to the President of 
the Republic.  In its essence, the ideas contained in the 
two MPs are similar to those that circulated (in the PT 
platform) during the presidential elections. 
 
Another event that forced the government to reconsider some 
of its positions is the recent energy crisis in the 
Northeast.  It is good to remember that during the 
presidential campaign, and even after Lula took office, some 
of the current authorities in the sector proposed breaking 
contracts both with the emergency thermal-plant operators 
as well as with the PPT.  Even some professors who currently 
hold office in the government suggested bringing suits 
against  the contracts with the Public Ministry. 
 
In light of these declarations, the start in operations of 
the emergency thermal plants was delayed to the maximum, 
obviously with costs to the consumers.  However, with the 
worsening of the crisis, the government \"did an about face\", 
and during the second week of January (2004), more than 30 
thermals were turned on, at a cost of R$230 to R$430 per 
MWh. 
 
In the petroleum sector there are two stories.  The first is 
the lack of transparency in the policy for gasoline, diesel 
and GLP prices.  Petrobras claimed throughout 2003 that 
their prices were the same or less than those on the 
international market.  However, when we compare the prices 
of Petrobras with those of American golf, we verify that the 
internal prices were always higher than the external ones. 
This explains, in part, the result presented by Petrobras\' 
supply section.  In 2003, this section, responsible for the 
sale of derivatives, accounted for around 30% in the total 
profit of the company, while in 2002 it was only 15%. 
 
The second story is linked to the bidding on petroleum and 
natural gas blocs.  In July last year, on the eve of the 
auction in these areas, the CNPE (Nacional Council on Energy 
Policy) published Resolution No. 08.  The resolution 
contains two points that seem to have passed unnoticed by 
the market.  The first took away, in practice, ANP\'s 
authority  to grant concessions.    The second created two 
concepts emblematic of the current government\'s 
interventionism: the concept of the ideal relationship (sic) 
between reserves and production, and that of the adequate 
volume (sic) of reserves in the country.  In reality, this 
resolution strengthens the MME and leaves it to be 
understood that once self-sufficiency is attained, new 
auctions (concessions) will no longer be necessary. 
 
In the field of regulation, the government passed the year 
alternating between being for and against autonomy and 
independence of the agencies.  However, at the end of 2003, 
the government appeared to have opted for building a 
regulatory standard through which the agencies have their 
power reduced and their decisions politicized.  This became 
clear with the appointment of a politician with a position 
against the opening of the petroleum and gas sector to the 
ANP board of directors, and the dismissal of the president 
of ANATEL for having disagreed with the Minister of 
Communications. 
 
No matter how competent the government is in the art of 
hiding its true intentions, it\'s not possible to fool 
everyone all the time. 
 
In this sense, it is a shame that after all the time and 
work put into achieving macroeconomic stability, the 
government lets a unique opportunity for attracting private 
investment for the infrastructure sector get away. 
 
In 2004, the government needs to assume an attitude 
compatible with our real needs.  This means separating the 
Entrepreneur-state from the Regulator-state; establishing a 
regulatory and tax model that offers incentives to private 
investment; and stimulating competition.  If not, we will be 
promoting the break up of our macroeconomic equilibrium.

SUBJECT:  GOB BACK-AND-FORTH OVER EARLY 2004 BUDGET FREEZES 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  FINANCE MINISTER PALOCCI\'S AUSTERITY APPROACH 
HAS PREVAILED YET AGAIN, WITH PRESIDENT LULA\'S DECISION TO 
ENDORSE THE FREEZE OF 4.5 BILLION REALS (USD 1.6 BILLION) IN 
2004 GOB BUDGET EXPENDITURES.  LOCAL MEDIA FOR THE LAST WEEK 
HAD BEEN REPLETE WITH REPORTS THAT LULA\'S CHIEF OF STAFF 
DIRCEU AND PLANNING MINISTER MANTEGA WERE PRESSURING AGAINST 
THE STEP.  LULA\'S LATEST ENDORSEMENT OF HIS FINANCE 
MINISTER\'S CAUTION-FIRST APPROACH OUGHT TO QUASH THE MARKET 
MINI-JITTERS WHICH BEGAN TO ARISE IN LATE JANUARY OVER 
SUPPOSED GOB ECONOMIC-POLICY IRRESOLUTION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  BACKGROUND:  A PERENNIAL FEBRUARY FISCAL ISSUE FOR THE 
GOB IS WHETHER TO SUSPEND (\"CONTINGENCIAR\") DISCRETIONARY 
BUDGET EXPENDITURES FOR THE COMING FISCAL YEAR, AT LEAST 
TEMPORARILY, AND IF SO BY HOW MUCH.  THIS IS A STANDARD, 
REQUIRED STAGE OF BRAZIL\'S FEDERAL BUDGET PROCESS.  THE 
EXPENDITURES IN QUESTION TYPICALLY ARE THOSE FOR INVESTMENT 
PROJECTS ADDED BY CONGRESS DURING DEBATE OVER THE GOB\'S 
INITIAL BUDGET PROPOSAL SUBMITTED IN AUGUST.  ONCE CONGRESS 
APPROVES A FINAL BUDGET (WHICH IT MUST DO BY LAW BEFORE 
CALENDAR-YEAR\'S END), THE PRESIDENT MUST SIGN IT WITHIN 30 
DAYS.  THEREAFTER, HOWEVER, THE GOB HAS ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS 
TO DECLARE WHETHER IT PLANS TO SPEND THE AMOUNTS AUTHORIZED, 
WHICH IT HAS AUTHORITY NOT/NOT TO DO IN FULL, OR AT ALL. 
IMMEDIATELY UPON ENTERING OFFICE IN JANUARY 2003, FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE LULA GOVERNMENT SUSPENDED 14 BILLION REALS OF 
INVESTMENT EXPENDITURE IN ITS `INHERITED\' BUDGET FOR 2003, 
AND ENDED UP SPENDING UNDER TWO BILLION THROUGH YEAR\'S END. 
 
3.  THIS PROCESS ALLOWS BRAZIL\'S EXECUTIVE TO WALK BACK AT 
LEAST PART OF THE UNREALISTIC REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS AND 
CONCOMITANT SPENDING INCREASES THAT CONGRESS INVARIABLY ADDS 
TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S ORIGINAL BUDGET SUBMISSION.  THIS YEAR, 
FOR EXAMPLE, CONGRESS ADDED 11 BILLION REALS TO THE GOB\'S 
2004 REVENUE PROJECTIONS, JUSTIFYING ITS ACTION WITH, AMONG 
OTHER ITEMS, A GDP GROWTH PROJECTION OF 4%, VS. 3.5% IN THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S SUBMISSION.  THE INCREASED REVENUE PROJECTION 
WAS THEN USED TO AUTHORIZE EXTRA EXPENDITURE, INCLUDING A 
HIKE IN THE INVESTMENT BUDGET FROM THE 7.8 BILLION REALS OF 
THE GOB\'S ORIGINAL BUDGET SUBMISSION TO 12.4 BILLION REALS. 
 
4.  LOCAL MEDIA FOR A FORTNIGHT HAVE HEADLINED A SUPPOSED TOP- 
LEVEL INTRA-GOB BACK-AND-FORTH ON THE ISSUE OF SPENDING 
SUSPENSIONS FOR 2004.  PALOCCI WAS PRESUMED EX OFFICIO TO 
FAVOR A PARTIAL SUSPENSION.  PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF 
DIRCEU REPEATEDLY DECLARED THE 2004 INVESTMENT BUDGET SHOULD 
AND WOULD BE FULFILLED IN FULL.  MINISTER OF PLANNING 
MANTEGA, WHOSE JOB IT IS TO DRAFT THE FORMAL SPENDING PLAN 
FOR THE YEAR, WAS QUOTED MORE CAUTIOUSLY ALONG THE SAME 
LINES.  SOME PT MINISTERS, INCLUDING MANTEGA, REPORTEDLY FELT 
LULA\'S GOB WOULD BE ON SHAKY POLITICAL GROUND IF IT WERE TO 
SUSPEND ANY INVESTMENT, SINCE THE PT LONG ATTACKED PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENTS FOR FAILING TO EXECUTE ALL AUTHORIZED 
EXPENDITURES AND THUS MAKING THE BUDGET \"A FICTION.\" 
UNEXPECTEDLY GOOD JANUARY GOB TAX COLLECTIONS, WHICH CAME IN 
1.8 BILLION REALS OVER THE GOVERNMENT\'S 2004 BUDGET TARGET, 
ALSO UNDERMINED THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE\'S CONSERVATIVE 
STANCE, IN THE EYES OF CRITICS. 
 
5.  THE UPSHOT: ALL LOCAL MEDIA ON FEBRUARY 6 REPORTED LULA\'S 
DECISION, ALBEIT STILL NOT PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED, TO GUARANTEE 
GOB EXPENDITURE ON PUBLIC-INVESTMENT IN 2004 OF ONLY THE 7.8 
BILLION REALS LAID OUT BY THE THE GOB IN ITS ORIGINAL BUDGET 
PROPOSAL LAST AUGUST.  THE 4.5 BILLION REALS IN ADDITIONAL 
PROJECTS INSERTED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE 
ARE THUS ALL TO BE ALL SUSPENDED.  (NOTE: AT LEAST ONE LOCAL 
ACCOUNT INACCURATELY REFERRED TO THE GOB\'S BUDGET \"CUTS\" AND 
THE FIGURE OF FOUR BILLION REALS.  END NOTE).  IN AN EVIDENT 
ATTEMPT TO MOLLIFY POLITICAL REACTION, LULA AND THE GOB 
SUPPOSEDLY AIM TO ACHIEVE THESE SAVINGS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
THROUGH ECONOMIES OF MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONAL EXPENSES 
(\"CUSTEIO\") -- RATHER THAN PURELY BY ELIMINATION OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN A LOCAL-ELECTION YEAR.  THE TOTAL 
2004 GOB BUDGET FOR \"CUSTEIO\" IS A REPORTED REALS 38 BILLION. 
 
6.  THE FEBRUARY 6 FINANCIAL DAILY `VALOR\' REPORTS THAT THE 
GOB HAD FOUND A WAY TO FURTHER FINESSE THIS POLITICAL FIX 
WHILE MAINTAINING SUFFICIENT CONTROL OVER EXPENDITURES TO 
ENSURE MEETING ITS 4.25% OF GDP PRIMARY-SURPLUS TARGET. 
INSTEAD OF AN OUTRIGHT SUSPENSION, THE GOB WILL RESORT TO A 
FORMULA, REFERRED TO IN THE BRAZIL\'S FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
LAW AS \"TECHNICAL RESERVES,\" WHICH KEEPS IN RESERVE REVENUES 
ABOVE ITS BASELINE PROJECTION, ACCORDING TO THIS ACCOUNT. 
ANY \"WINDFALL\" REVENUES COULD THEN BE SPENT BEGINNING IN THE 
LAST QUARTER OF THE YEAR.  HENCE, SHOULD JANUARY\'S HIGHER- 
THAN-EXPECTED TAX REVENUES PROVE A SUSTAINED TREND, THE GOB 
WOULD INCREASE EXPENDITURES COMMENSURATELY FROM THE BASE 
LEVEL IN ITS ORIGINAL BUDGET SUBMISSION, AS OF THE FOURTH 
QUARTER.  THIS STRATEGY WOULD FREE THE GOB FROM HAVING TO USE 
THE POLITICALLY SENSITIVE \"CONTINGENCIAR\" WORD. 
 
7.  COMMENT:  A CLEAR MESSAGE THROUGH ALL THIS INTRA-GOB 
POLITICAL MANEUVERING IS THAT THE GOB\'S ECONOMIC TEAM, AND 
FIRST AND FOREMOST PRESIDENT LULA AS SUPREME POLICY ARBITER, 
REMAIN DEDICATED TO THE 4.25% SURPLUS TARGET FOR THE 2004 
BUDGET, UNMOVED BY THE POLITICAL MINUSES OF CONTINUED SLOW 
GROWTH AND JOBLESSNESS IN BRAZIL\'S LOCAL-ELECTION YEAR.

SUBJECT: AFGHAN PRESENTATION FOR BRAZILIAN MILITARY 
OFFICIALS 
 
1.  (U) During a DATT-hosted 18 February dinner for key 
military contacts, poloff, recently returned from an 
Afghanistan TDY, delivered a graphic powerpoint presentation 
on Coalition nation building efforts in that country. The 
presentation focused on four themes: the overall security and 
reconstruction mission of the US-led Coalition; the nature, 
role, and skill sets of the Provincial Reconstruction Teams 
(PRTs); the desperate needs of the Afghan people; and the 
range of assistance being delivered to Afghanistan by the 
USG. Brazilian attendees represented all three armed service 
branches as well as the Ministries of Defense and Foreign 
Relations. 
 
2.  (U) Questions during and after the presentation, 
particularly from the professional military officers, 
indicated a keen interest in how the Coalition was moving 
from emphasis on counter-Taliban/al Qaeda combat operations 
(Phase III) to greater focus on stabilization/reconstruction 
(Phase IV). Attendees were struck by Afghanistan\'s low levels 
of economic and social development, particularly in the rural 
areas, and impressed by the range of institution building 
programs already underway. Many were impressed by the 
country\'s extensive poppy cultivation and acknowledged the 
huge challenge of poppy eradication given the country\'s 
poverty and lack of cash crops. One officer queried as to the 
time horizon for rebuilding Afghanistan, implying a question 
as to whether the USG had the staying power to finish the 
job. Other questions concerned the logistical support behind 
national reconstruction. Analogies with Iraq\'s political and 
reconstruction issues were also raised, and some officers 
later asked if a similar USG presentation could be delivered 
to the Brazilian military regarding that country. 
 
3.  (SBU) Comment: Attendees displayed curiosity about the 
Coalition\'s nation building efforts and appeared drawn to the 
possible relevance of the Afghan experience to Brazil\'s own 
future international missions. The presentation sought to 
portray the U.S. mission in Afghanistan in its true light, 
countering local misperceptions that the U.S. only cares 
about its own interests and Coalition soldiers huddle behind 
the wire in fortified compounds. While there is little 
likelihood Brazil will contribute to efforts in Afghanistan 
at this time, the military desires to learn more about the 
situation there. In light of Brazil\'s current seat on the 
UNSC and the internal GOB review of Brazil\'s future 
peacekeeping efforts, particularly in Africa, poloff 
suggested the GOB consider having a team go to Afghanistan. 
Officers affirmed that Brazil\'s armed forces, if ordered, 
were ready and willing to engage in international PKO 
efforts. However funding remains a big hurdle. Poloff will 
continue to offer this presentation to other key Brazilian 
audiences.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Post recommends that Brazil remain on the 
Priority Watch List for the 2004 Special 301 Review.  Despite 
several positive developments, including tougher penalties for 
copyright infractions and increased (but isolated) police 
action against copyright theft, the Lula administration has not 
yet developed a comprehensive national strategy for addressing 
the country\'s poor IPR enforcement, nor has it reduced the 
backlog of patent and trademark applications.  Several signs 
suggest that substantial progress is in the offing, but to date 
there has been little concrete improvement in Brazil\'s 
enforcement record.  Widespread recognition of the harm caused 
by IPR abuse to Brazilian artists, tax revenues, and 
technological progress/industrial development has increased, 
due in part to successful public awareness campaigns launched 
by both the private and public sectors.  The federal government 
has incorporated intellectual property regime improvements in 
its 2004-2007 Pluriannual Plan, and the formation of a 
Commission of Parliamentary Inquiry (CPI) and a permanent 
Caucus (Frente Parlamentar) on the issue of piracy and tax 
evasion in Brazil\'s Congress has generated much positive 
momentum. Leaving unaltered Brazil\'s Special 301 status while 
recognizing the progress it has made would send the clear 
signal that its continued poor IPR enforcement is a significant 
bilateral concern, but not damage the efforts of those within 
Brazil who seek tangible improvement.  End summary. 
 
Copyright Piracy - Positive Strides But Piracy Still Rampant 
 
2. (SBU) Several of the industry Special 301 submissions 
welcome the increased interest in piracy and tax evasion 
generated in the Brazilian Congress in 2003.  The Chamber of 
Deputies\' Piracy CPI and the spin-off permanent Caucus may well 
represent the best hope for national-level action to improve 
copyright enforcement.  As IIPA\'s submission suggests, the 
CPI\'s final report due in June will include several private 
sector generated action proposals for the federal government 
that should substantially remedy the lack of concrete 
coordinated action against piracy.  While the issue gains 
prominence, the crime continues unabated.  Special piracy task 
forces or police units in some Brazilian states and 
municipalities have produced enforcement successes and worked 
cooperatively with the CPI to make some high-profile arrests 
(refs E, G, H, I, K).  These encouraging but isolated foci of 
activity are not coordinated and exist despite the 
Administration\'s failure to formulate a national strategy. 
 
3. (SBU) The administration\'s Inter-ministerial Committee to 
Fight Piracy (IMC) met 11 times during its first year under the 
leadership of former federal police official Clovis Monteiro da 
Silva, but was bogged down in the bureaucracy of transition to 
the new Lula administration for much of the first half of 2003. 
Residing in the Ministry of Justice, the IMC continues to 
disappoint most with its lack of vision in addressing the fight 
against piracy.  One member of the committee told econoff 
recently that the IMC has lots of great ideas but no authority 
or resources to implement them.  Monteiro notes that the IMC 
still suffers from insufficient funds to accomplish its 
mission, and some ambitious 2003 plans, such as a Mercosul IPR 
conference, had to be postponed. 
 
4. (SBU) Ref B notes Brazil-based industry representatives\' 
assessment of the IMC as largely ineffective, but several of 
the committee\'s actions in 2003 deserve mention.  Monteiro is 
most proud of the IPR introductory training course now required 
at the federal police academy and hopes to duplicate the 
success of this program in all police training curricula (civil 
and military).  The public awareness campaign initiated in 2003 
with radio, billboards and isolated television spots in a few 
cities will be expanded nationwide to include anti-piracy movie 
trailers.  Monteiro insists that the educating role of the IMC 
is significantly undervalued, and that in the long-term, this 
effort will reduce piracy.  He admits that the IMC would gain 
from improved self-promotion and publicity to inform the 
interested public of its activities and accomplishments. 
According to Monteiro, the Committee\'s role of coordinating 
action within the Federal government, including with the police 
and customs officials where true enforcement takes place, is 
difficult to appreciate, but he believes that the growing 
recognition of the scope of Brazil\'s piracy problem is due to 
the quiet, consistent work of the Committee.  There wouldn\'t be 
a CPI on piracy if the IMC did not exist, he told econoff. 
 
5. (SBU) The IMC and the Federal Police are developing a 
database of piracy actions that will be accessible by federal, 
state civil and military police.  This effort entails modifying 
an existing crime database to include crimes related to piracy. 
The IMC has not yet finalized its 2004 action plan, which is to 
be included in the National Public Security Plan, but held its 
first meeting of the year on February 19.  Monteiro plans to 
focus on widening the public awareness campaign and 
strengthening ties within Mercosul and with WIPO.  The IMC will 
also be studying changes to the legislation that created the 
Committee to strengthen its powers and expand its jurisdiction. 
Contrasted with the CPI\'s warm and cooperative relationship 
with the private sector, the IMC appears to regard the industry 
associations with a certain suspicion, particularly concerning 
industry statistics on damages caused by piracy -- which the 
IMC maintains are not credible.  The IMC is working on 
developing its own statistics and studying the economic impacts 
of the creation and theft of intellectual property.  With the 
start of the CPI, the private sector\'s involvement with the IMC 
has waned, but the IMC invited private associations to 
participate in several 2003 meetings, according to Monteiro. 
 
6. (SBU) In July 2003 President Lula signed a law amending 
the Brazilian criminal code with respect to copyright 
violations (ref L).  The law increases the minimum penalty 
from one to two years\' imprisonment, levies a fine and 
allows for improved seizure and destructions procedures for 
contraband.  The law does not include increased sanctions 
for software infringement.  The free software movement is 
building support within the GoB and throughout Brazil.  GoB 
procurement regulations prohibit use of unlicensed software, 
according to Itamaraty officials, but no special decrees or 
directives exist to further encourage compliance with 
international standards of copyright protection. 
 
Patents - Talk but Little Action 
 
7. (SBU) As ref C illustrates, Brazil\'s difficulties in 
granting patents and trademarks continues to worsen, as INPI 
lacks much needed resources and the involvement of the Ministry 
of Health\'s Sanitary Vigilance Agency (ANVISA) in 
pharmaceutical patents become more pronounced.  INPI\'s Patent 
Director estimates the current patent backlog at 50,000. 
PhRMA\'s estimate of 450,000 pending trademark applications 
strikes us as reasonable.  The administration\'s industrial 
policy goals, focusing on improving the technological base of 
Brazilian industry with special emphasis on software and 
pharmaceutical industries, put INPI in the spotlight.  The 2004- 
07 Pluriannual Plan fixes the objective of reducing processing 
time for patents from seven to four years and for trademarks 
from four to one year. 
 
8. (SBU) There appears to be recognition within the 
administration that the INPI/ANVISA linkage with regard to 
patent approval for pharmaceutical products or processes has 
taken on negative dimensions, but no remedies have been 
proposed (refs C and F).  INPI\'s staffing woes should be 
ameliorated somewhat this year with the addition of 108 
positions now available to qualified civil servants, and 
officials from the Ministry of Development Industry and Foreign 
Trade (MDIC) expect a permanent President of INPI to be named 
shortly. 
 
TRIPS Compliance and Related Issues 
 
9. (SBU) Presidential Decree 4370/03 amends existing patent 
legislation regarding compulsory licensing in situations of 
national emergency or public interest.  The GoB quickly 
instituted the measure after the August 30 WTO Access to 
Medicines Agreement while in the midst of price negotiations 
with several pharmaceutical companies regarding medicines for 
its world-renowned HIV/AIDS treatment program.  The measure has 
not been invoked, and its TRIPS compliance is uncertain (ref 
J).  Legislation pertaining to designs for integrated circuits 
(Bill 1787/96) remains pending in Congress; Itamaraty officials 
have repeatedly requested priority action on the bill, to no 
avail. 
10. (SBU) Previous Brazilian legislation dealing with 
aspects of genetic \"patrimony\" or heritage related to 
biodiversity conservation, integrity of genetic patrimony 
and traditional knowledge was superceded by the issuance of 
Provisional Measure 2.186 of August 23, 2001, which together 
with Decree 3.945 of 2001 and subsequent regulations, 
subject access and transfer of genetic patrimony to the 
approval of the Genetic Heritage Management Council (GHMC) - 
- a body composed of several ministries, academics, and 
others which is directed by the Ministry of Environment -- 
and to the sharing of benefits in contractual terms and 
legally established conditions.  New draft legislation on 
genetic patrimony, which would replace the Provisional 
Measure and subsequent regulations, is reportedly under 
consideration in the Brazilian Executive Branch, and could 
be introduced in the Brazilian Congress later this year. 
 
Biotechnology 
 
11. (SBU) In January 2004, Monsanto announced that it had 
reached an agreement with farmers from the Brazilian state of 
Rio Grande do Sul to receive remuneration for the use of 
Roundup Ready technology found in the company\'s soybean variety 
grown widely throughout the state.  The GoB\'s position on 
biotechnology remains undecided, as the biotechnology bill is 
still under debate in Congress (ref D). 
 
12. (SBU) Itamaraty confirms that the GOB has no plans to 
ratify the 1996 WIPO Copyright treaty or the WIPO Performances 
and Phonograms Treaty. 
 
Recommendation 
 
13. (SBU) Despite positive strides in some sectors, post 
believes that the continued lack of tangible improvements in 
IPR protection and enforcement as a whole in the last year 
manifestly precludes lowering Brazil\'s Special 301 status. 
However, we recognize a positive momentum that should bear 
fruit this year, with projects in the pipeline such as the 
CPI\'s final report and INPI\'s increased staffing.  We concur 
with industry submissions that suggest that retaining Brazil 
as a Priority Watch List country will appropriately convey 
the importance of the issue in our bilateral relationship, 
and believe that this position would not unduly discourage 
the forces of positive change within Brazil.  To ensure that 
we can use the announcement to promote further progress we 
request that, should Brazil\'s status be maintained, USTR\'s 
announcement clearly recognize the positive developments 
regarding IPR that did occur and the USG\'s desire to work 
collaboratively to produce tangible results in the coming 
year.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.    (U) Brazil\'s nominal net public debt and debt/GDP 
ratio both continued to rise in 2003, but there are grounds 
for guarded hope that the debt burden is not now the 
imminent threat it has been in recent years.  The debt/GDP 
ratio (58.2% end-December) is far down from its brief late- 
2002 spike of 64% and is forecast to decline year-on-year in 
2004 -- a first since 1993.  The GoB has worked well to 
reduce the debt\'s exchange-rate vulnerability:  foreign 
public debt grew fractionally in 2003, but the dollar-linked 
component of domestic debt was steeply down, to 10% of the 
total (20.5%, including swap exposure) from end-2002\'s 20.3% 
(53.5%, including swap exposure).  The Real\'s appreciation 
since late 2002 from almost four to under three per USD has 
in itself greatly eased service of the debt\'s foreign- 
currency component.  And Brazil\'s soaring exports have added 
a new shock-absorber against sudden depreciation of the Real 
and consequent surges in dollar-linked debt. 
 
2.   (U) Eighty percent of the total debt is domestic, i.e., 
denominated in Reals.  Half of that 80% is tied to the 
Central Bank\'s benchmark SELIC interest rate.  Thus, the 
SELIC\'s drop from 26.5 to 16.5% since June 2003, if 
continued, means future-year savings in interest payments of 
1.5-3.0% of GDP, as the GoB replaces or retires old debt 
issued at high SELIC rates.  In a \"virtuous-circle\" effect, 
the return of market confidence during Lula\'s first year has 
allowed the GoB to improve the composition of its 
securitized debt by issuing more fixed-rate paper, as well 
as (since August) lengthening maturities.  GoB optimists 
speak of cutting debt-service costs enough to achieve 
nominal/nominal balanced budgets by 2008, paving the way for 
debt/GDP to decline to the low 40% range within the decade. 
 
3.   (SBU) Yet Brazil\'s public debt remains far too close 
for comfort to a macroeconomic knife\'s edge.  The Lula 
government\'s hard-won primary surplus of 4.32% of GDP in 
2003 still covered less than half of the interest payment 
(9.49%) on its debt stock.  The overall nominal debt and 
debt ratio each thus still grew by around three percent. 
(The Real\'s appreciation partly counteracted the nominal- 
deficit effect, by shrinking the valuation in Reals of 
foreign-exchange-linked debt.)  For 2004, the GoB itself 
projects only a modest reduction in the ratio, to 57.3% -- 
even assuming 3.5% GDP growth.  Domestic and/or external 
shocks could reverse recent positive trends.  Meanwhile, the 
huge costs of debt-service sap the GoB\'s ability to make 
investments needed for growth, without which the debt burden 
will become more intractable.  Bottom line:  Lula\'s team in 
its first year made more progress in managing the public 
debt than even they might have dreamed possible -- but the 
debt worry looks sure to remain, hovering like a ghost over 
his entire term.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Scope and Structure 
------------------- 
 
4. (U) Brazil\'s net public-sector debt rose in 2003 from 881 
to 913 billion Reals (from 55.5 to 58.2% of year-end GDP). 
Converted at the then-exchange-rate of Reals 2.89 per USD, 
the end-2003 total amounted to $316.1 billion.  That dollar 
figure may mislead, however.  Net public foreign debt 
constituted just USD 64.6 billion, or 20.4% of the total. 
The other four-fifths was domestic and denominated in Reals. 
Thus, the GoB can finance itself almost entirely on the 
local market.  About 90% of new debt issued is domestic; 
recent modest external issues have involved simply rolling 
over foreign-exchange debt.  The domestic debt admittedly 
includes foreign-exchange exposure of about USD 55.8 billion 
in the form of domestic securities tied to the exchange rate 
or currency swaps issued in parallel with those securities. 
The total foreign-exchange-rate exposure of Brazil\'s public 
debt thus amounts to roughly USD 121 billion, 30.4% of the 
total (40.9% including swaps). 
 
5. (U) FOREIGN-DEBT NOTE:  The GoB (and IMF-approved) figure 
for Brazil\'s foreign public-debt total is net/net of 
official gross/gross reserves.  The latter at end-2003 were 
below USD 60 billion, of which over USD 38 billion 
represented IMF loans.  Net reserves then were under 20 
billion, a small fraction of their average since the early 
1980s.  The GoB has since increased its net reserves by over 
two billion dollars via open-market purchases, an ongoing 
process.   END NOTE.

6.  NOTE:  To avoid confusion amongst specialist followers 
of Brazilian finances, it should be noted that Brazil\'s net 
public domestic debt (\"divida liquida\") is not the same as 
its Federal Domestic Securitized Debt (FDSD -- \"divida 
mobiliaria\").  The latter includes some GoB paper which does 
not reflect net debt, e.g., extra issuances to sterilize the 
CB\'s open-market purchases of dollars to boost reserves, or 
other monetary-policy operations.  FDSD thus is sometimes 
greater, sometimes less, than net domestic debt, as a 
comparison of Table 1 above with Table 3 displays.

How Did We Get Here? 
-------------------- 
 
7. (U) Multiple dynamics raised Brazil\'s federal debt/GDP 
level from 1994\'s 30% to the current 58+%.  The key drivers 
have been: a) high nominal deficits (and, before 1998, 
primary deficits), generated fundamentally by the high 
interest rates to which successive GoBs have resorted to 
stabilize the currency and fight inflation in the face of 
various shocks; b) centralization of state, municipal and 
other liabilities at the federal level after the mid-1990s; 
c) currency devaluation since 1998; and d) stubbornly low 
GDP growth. 
 
High, Interest-Driven Deficits 
------------------------------ 
 
8. (U) Before the 1997-99 emerging-market financial crisis, 
the GoB ran not just nominal but primary consolidated budget 
deficits.  The Cardoso government of that era maintained an 
overvalued exchange rate by means of high interest rates. 
When forced to float the Real in 1999, it raised interest 
rates still further to control inflation.  These factors 
help explain how interest costs of what was initially a 
relatively modest stock of debt have for years been so high. 
 
9. (U) The years since 1998 have seen primary-budget 
surpluses of 3.2% of GDP or better.  However, in those same 
years debt service has grown to 7-9% of GDP in interest 
payments alone.  This tremendous expense soaks up as much as 
a quarter of government revenues (federal and state.)  It 
has been the primary agent behind Brazil\'s fiscal deficits 
since the Plano Real in 1994.  To illustrate:  the Lula 
government\'s hard-won 4.32% of GDP primary surplus covered 
less than half its interest expenditures (9.49% of GDP) in 
2003.  Result: a nominal deficit of 5.16% of GDP.  Table 4 
illustrates the impact of debt service on Brazil\'s fiscal 
accounts over the last half-decade.

10. (SBU) NOTE:  Unibanco\'s chief economist once lamented to 
Econoff that his former employer, the World Bank, had ever 
convinced the IMF to fix primary surpluses instead of actual 
deficits as program benchmarks.  This policy, he said, masks 
the extent of a country\'s fiscal problems.  In Brazil\'s 
case, even the current 4.3% of GDP primary surplus is not 
enough to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio, he argued.  END 
NOTE. 
 
\"Skeletons\" 
----------- 
 
11. (U) The Cardoso administration\'s responsible process 
through the late-1990s of acknowledging bad state, municipal 
and parastatal debt, plus some other liabilities, has also 
driven up the official GoB debt level.  Much of these debts, 
commonly referred to as \"skeletons\", have been centralized 
in the federal government.  \"Skeletons\" added an officially 
estimated 8.62% of GDP to the stock of federal public debt 
in the eight years to December 2003.  Pessimists opine that 
more skeletons remain to be unearthed, perhaps another 5-8% 
of GDP, but this upper figure seems increasingly unlikely. 
 
Currency Depreciation 
--------------------- 
 
12. (U) Since 1998, the dominant factor in worsening the 
debt/GDP ratio has been the exchange rate.  This was 
reflected by the jump in the ratio after the GoB was forced 
to float the Real in early 1999.  From 41.7% in 1998, the 
ratio leapt to 48.7% at the end of 1999.  (The particularly 
high interest rates briefly imposed in 1999 were also a 
factor, but those rates themselves stemmed from the need to 
staunch capital flight and inflationary effects arising from 
the devaluation.)  The Real\'s renewed plunge from April into 
October 2002 -- combined with the effects of high interest 
rates employed to combat inflation and restore market 
confidence during the presidential campaign -- likewise took 
a toll, causing the brief spike at 64%. 
 
13. (U) A CSFB study gave as the rule-of-thumb for the 
second half of 2002 (with the Real in the 3.50-4.0/dollar 
zone) that a 10% currency devaluation translated to a 2 
percent rise in Brazil\'s debt/GDP.  At its worst, in 
November 2002, it meant a 3.4% increase.  This effect was 
not mainly due to Brazil\'s relatively modest foreign public 
debt.  Rather, it was driven by the then-burgeoning level of 
the dollar-linked portion of domestic public debt.  That, in 
turn, was generated by the GoB\'s practice, adopted out of 
necessity, of holding down interest rates on its new debt by 
increasing issuance of dollar-linked instruments.  As part 
of this process, starting in April 2002 the Central Bank 
also began issuing dozens of billions of dollars\' worth of 
swaps in parallel with new Treasury SELIC issuances.  (IMF 
rules forbid Treasury from selling swaps or other 
derivatives.) 
 
14. (U) Lula\'s GOB has assiduously reduced this exposure to 
exchange-rate volatility.  As market confidence in his 
financial team has grown, the latter has been able to 
retire, rather than roll over, massive portions of dollar- 
linked debt coming due, replacing them with non-dollar- 
linked debt.  In 2003, it retired from the market over $20 
billion in dollar-linked debt and debt-related swaps.  By 
year\'s-end, the dollar-linked part of the domestic debt had 
halved, from 20.3 to 10.0%, year-on-year.  Including swaps, 
the drop was from 33.5 to 20.5%.  The process has 
accelerated since, with a total of $7.6 billion more in 
dollar-denominated debt retired in the first two months of 
2004, according to the latest GoB figures.

FLOATING INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE 
------------------------------- 
 
15. (U) As the debt\'s foreign-exchange component has shrunk, 
its interest-rate component has grown.  Half the domestic 
debt is floating-rate, linked to the Central Bank\'s discount 
(SELIC) rate.  To illustrate the potential downside of this 
factor: the Central Bank\'s interest-rate hikes in response 
to the crisis of confidence in 2002 increased average 
interest on Brazil\'s domestic public securitized debt to a 
peak of 31.7% in November 2002. 
 
16. (U) The GoB has begun to turn the tide in this area, as 
seen in Table 6.  New financial-market confidence has 
allowed it to reduce interest rates, increase issues of 
fixed-rate debt (from under two to over twelve percent of 
the total, year-on-year by end-2003) and, beginning in 
August 2003, also to lengthen maturities.  By December 2003, 
the SELIC had dropped to 16.5% from 26.5% in mid-2003, and 
the average interest rate on domestic debt was down to 
around 22%.  This, to be sure, still left the real rate well 
in the double-digit range.  As for foreign-debt service:  by 
January 2004, the GoB was able to launch a 30-year Eurobond 
with a spread of 377 basis points above U.S. Treasuries -- 
quite remarkable after the spreads of 24% above U.S. 
Treasuries little more than a year before.

GDP:  The Stagnant Variable 
--------------------------- 
 
17. (U) The final variable in the debt/GDP equation is GDP 
itself.  Brazil\'s anemic growth over the last several years 
has exacerbated the ratio\'s increase.  Growth in 2004 is 
widely forecast to recover to 3.5%.  But even if that 
scenario is borne out, along with market expectations of 
relative exchange-rate stability (3.1-3.2 Reals/$) plus a 
further decline in the SELIC interest rate to 13.5% at end- 
year, private-sector specialists calculate debt/GDP at end- 
2004 will still be 58%.  The GoB itself forecasts just a 
modest fall, to 57.2%. 
 
18. (U) After 2004, projections of declining debt/GDP levels 
depend critically on sustained growth rates of at least 3.5 
to 4%.  Indeed, the public debt will only be payable to the 
extent that Brazil solves its longer-term growth problem. 
That solution, in turn, hinges on the raft of microeconomic 
reforms necessary to increase economic efficiency and 
promote investment (Ref A.) 
 
19. (U) Meanwhile, Brazil\'s debt level in itself stymies 
longer-term growth.  Most GoB borrowing is to roll over 
maturing debt and to pay current fiscal deficits.  Public 
investment has dried up, squeezed both by debt service and 
constitutional spending earmarks which leave only about 9% 
of the federal budget as discretionary spending. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
20. (SBU) Financial-market enthusiasm for Brazil debt-paper 
seems ready for the long-haul.  Certainly Brazil has come a 
good way from the \"vicious circle\" near-panic induced by the 
presidential campaign of 2002, with that period\'s plummeting 
exchange rate, interest-rate hikes, and extreme difficulty 
in debt-rollover.  But, for all the debt-management skill 
and progress of Lula\'s first year, Brazil\'s public-debt 
profile could quite easily again fall prey to negative turns 
of market mood if, e.g., local interest-rate or global risk- 
capital trends take a bad turn, and/or domestic growth in 
the real economy continues not to materialize. 
 
21. (SBU) Beyond keeping its fingers crossed against 
external and domestic shocks, the GoB can now best improve 
its debt sustainability by enacting structural and 
microeconomic reforms to attract investment and boost 
growth.  Unfortunately, the early results of its efforts to 
reform the tax, pension and regulatory systems have been 
economically underwhelming, however politically resolute. 
The phantoms of doubt about Brazil\'s debt have withdrawn to 
the wings for now, but will surely hang around, ready again 
to haunt the GoB, through Lula\'s term.

REF: BRASILIA 0402 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Waldomiro Diniz scandal that broke in 
Brazil on February 13 (reftel) continues to reverberate, and 
the end is not in sight.  Diniz, a deputy to Lula\'s Chief of 
Staff, Jose Dirceu, was fired when it was revealed that, as 
head of the Rio de Janeiro lottery authority in 2002, he 
solicited bribes from a numbers operator and reportedly 
funneled that money into several Workers\' Party (PT) 
election 
campaigns.  With Brazil returning to work on March 1 from 
the 
Carnaval holidays, the story remains front-page news and has 
spun off in different directions.  VEJA magazine ran a cover 
story alleging further PT campaign improprieties while 
other 
media reported that Diniz continued his influence peddling 
even after joining the Lula administration.  In that 
instance, the press implies that in early 2003, Diniz 
intervened to benefit GTech, a US firm that provides 
computerized lottery services.  In a February 20 statement, 
GTech stated that two of its officials met with Diniz and 
others in the new administration in early 2003, and that all 
such talks were transparent and professional. 
 
2. (SBU)  On the political front, President Lula issued a 
decree banning bingo games and slot machines throughout 
Brazil.  Congress must now vote on this measure, which is 
controversial because it put hundreds of thousands of gaming 
employees out of work.  This week, Congress will also decide 
whether to establish a congressional inquiry (CPI) into the 
Diniz scandal, or more likely, into the gaming sector in 
general.  While Congress\'s normal legislative agenda may be 
slowed by the fallout from the Diniz scandal, a political 
reform bill that would, inter alia, reform campaign finance 
rules, is on a fast track.  There is no hard proof that Jose 
Dirceu or other PT leaders filled party slush funds with 
money squeezed from legal and illegal gambling operators, 
but 
there are certainly a lot of unanswered questions.  While 
Lula\'s personal approval numbers remain high, his 
government, 
his party, and his Chief of Staff are taking a beating.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
MORE CHARGES OF ILLEGAL PT CAMPAIGN FINANCING 
--------------------------------------------- 
3. (SBU)  The fallout from the Waldomiro Diniz scandal that 
broke on February 13 is far from over.  In its 2/25 issue, 
VEJA magazine ran an article claiming that the alleged 
illegal campaign financing by the Workers\' Party (PT) in 
2002 
was not isolated to Diniz and the money he claims to have 
solicited for gubernatorial races in Rio and Brasilia.  The 
article reports that Jose Vicente Brizola, who in 2002 was 
Director of the Rio Grande do Sul state lottery authority, 
was pressured by that state\'s PT Senator Emilia Fernandes to 
solicit up to R$900,000 (about $300,000) from bingo 
operators 
for her failed reelection bid.  (Fernandes was Secretary for 
Women\'s Affairs in Lula\'s government until losing her job in 
the January 2004 cabinet reshuffle.)  If true, the story 
would be another black eye for the PT.  On the other hand, 
Brizola, who provided the basis for VEJA\'s report, is the 
son 
of former Rio governor Leonel Brizola, whose PDT party is a 
shrill opponent of Lula\'s government, and PT leaders respond 
that he is merely seeking revenge for not being offered a 
job 
in the administration. 
 
4. (SBU) Also last week, Luiz Eduardo Soares, who in 2003 
was 
fired as head of the Federal Police for hiring his wife and 
ex-wife as consultants, announced that while working in the 
Rio state government in 2002, he learned of Waldomiro 
Diniz\'s 
illegal fundraising for the PT, but when he brought it to 
the 
attention of party leaders, nothing was done and Diniz was 
left in place as head of the Rio lottery authority. 
 
DINIZ\'S ONGOING CORRUPTION -- US FIRM NAMED 
------------------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) Another set of allegations has sprung up suggesting 
that Diniz\'s corrupt activities did not end when he joined 
President Lula\'s staff.  The press is reporting that in 
2003, 
while serving as a senior advisor to Lula\'s Chief of Staff, 
Diniz met with officials of US firm GTech, which holds the 
contract to operate Brazil\'s 9,000 computerized lottery 
parlors.  Press reports indicate that Diniz met with numbers 
racketeer Carlinhos Cachoeira (\"Charlie Waterfall\") not only 
in the infamous 2002 videotapes (ref A), but also in early 
2003, when they  met with GTech officials to discuss a 
25-month extension of the firm\'s contract.  If Diniz\'s 
actions were improper, it would belie Lula\'s statements that 
Diniz\'s improprieties occurred before he joined the 
administration --it would put his corruption inside Lula\'s 
Planalto Palace.  In a February 20 statement, GTech stated 
that its officials met with Diniz and other officials of the 
new administration in early 2003, and that all such talks 
were transparent and professional. 
 
GTECH - WORLDWIDE LOTTERY OPERATOR 
---------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) In 1997, Brazilian firm Racimec, owned by Carlinhos 
Cachoeira --the lottery operator who made the videotapes of 
himself negotiating bribes with Waldomiro Diniz-- won a 
five-year contract to operate the federal lottery.  Racimec 
was then bought by GTech, a Rhode Island company with 2003 
revenues of $979 million that operates lotteries around the 
world.  This contract was extended through April 2003, and 
then re-extended for 25 more months.  The GoB is GTech\'s 
single largest customer, accounting for 10% of the firm\'s 
revenues.  In 2002, GTech filed a still-unresolved lawsuit 
against the GoB to prevent it from segmenting the lottery 
contract into four separate operations and thus reducing its 
need for GTech\'s services.  The stakes are high, lottery 
proceeds are about R$5 billion (about $1.7 billion) annually 
and, of this, about one-third is earmarked for GoB social 
programs. 
 
CONGRESS TO DECIDE ON DECREE ON BINGO\'S STATUS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
7. (SBU) Aside from the direct legal consequences of the 
scandal, there are political ramifications on at least three 
tracks:  the legal status of national bingo games, the 
possibility of a congressional inquiry (CPI), and efforts to 
reform campaign finance laws.  The first of these, the bingo 
games, was the subject of the President\'s first direct 
response to the scandal.  On February 20, seeking to exert 
control over the loosely-regulated bingo games, Lula issued 
a 
presidential decree (MP 168) banning all bingo and slot 
machines (but not lotteries) throughout Brazil.  Lula\'s 
office announced that the decree would remain in force until 
\"a definitive solution is found\".  In fact, to remain in 
force, the decree must be voted into law by Congress within 
60 days.  In its first week, MP 168 survived six legal 
challenges filed by bingo operators, and the wave of 
lawsuits 
is not likely to abate as the police continue seizure 
operations that have already netted 1,200 machines. 
 
8. (SBU) MP 168 is tricky business for Congress.  While the 
Diniz scandal has heightened public suspicions of the gaming 
sector, it is estimated that between 120,000 and 320,000 
gaming employees have been put out of work by the decree, 
and 
they have begun marching in the streets (one placard in 
Brasilia read, \"Jose Dirceu, Your Job Cost Me Mine!\").  This 
is tough medicine for an administration committed to 
reducing 
a rising tide of unemployment.  The GoB concern is that 
bingo 
parlors are used to launder money, but a PT Deputy (Gilmar 
Machado) already had administration support for a bill that 
would legalize and regulate the bingo games.  Further, there 
is a lingering suspicion that the Diniz scandal was 
orchestrated in part by numbers racketeers hoping to create 
pressure for greater legalization of gambling.  With so many 
competing inerests, it seems likely that the administration 
will push to get MP 168 ratified by Congress in the coming 
weeks, at least in part to reinforce Lula\'s political 
authority and to demonstrate that the administration and PT 
are moving forcefully against gambling.  That might then 
open 
the door for debate on a follow-on bill, such as Machado\'s, 
to re-legalize some sort of federal bingo. 
 
CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY STILL IN THE AIR 
-------------------------------------- 
9. (SBU) In the days after the scandal broke, party leaders 
in Congress argued over whether to open a congressional 
inquiry (CPI).  The PT leadership and administration oppose 
a 
CPI in part to avoid more public shaming at the hands of 
opposition politicians, but also because the GoB wants to 
refocus attention on its legislative agenda.  There were 
indications before Carnaval that intense lobbying by the PT 
and its coalition partners had rallied enough opposition 
votes to kill the CPI, but a threat by a PT Senator to 
investigate illegal campaign financing by other parties 
infuriated the opposition and left the issue to be settled 
this week.  One possible compromise is to open a CPI to look 
into the gaming sector in general, rather than any specific 
case.  The Diniz case is being investigated by the Federal 
Police and the Federal Prosecutor\'s office (both of whom 
will 
take Diniz\'s deposition this week), and the Rio state 
assembly. 
 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM GETS A BOOST 
------------------------------------ 
10. (SBU) While some of the GoB\'s legislative agenda is 
likely to be slowed by the Diniz scandal, a political reform 
bill has received a shot in the arm.  Political reform 
(meaning rules changes for parties, elections, and campaign 
financing) was on the back burner because in this, an 
election year, it seemed unlikely to pass.  Now, a bill that 
has been a year in the drafting by an ad hoc committee in 
the 
Chamber has moved forward to the Justice Committee and put 
in 
\"urgent procedure\", to speed its way to the floor.  However, 
the bill is controversial and will certainly undergo changes 
before passing into law. 
 
COMMENT - DIRCEU AND PT ARE DAMAGED 
----------------------------------- 
11. (SBU) There is no proof that Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu 
or other Workers\' Party leaders filled party slush funds 
with 
money squeezed from legal and illegal gaming operators, but 
there are certainly a lot of unanswered questions.  Dirceu 
has reportedly offered his resignation to Lula more than 
once 
since the scandal broke, but was rebuffed each time. 
Polling 
numbers not yet released publicly reportedly show Lula\'s 
personal approval numbers remain high, but that his 
government, his party, and his Chief of Staff are all 
suffering significantly in the public eye. 
 
12. (SBU)  It is the nature of Brazilian political scandals 
that leaks and revelations continue to emerge, but that 
weeks 
or months later, the whole thing goes away and only 
lower-level officials ever suffer legal sanction.  That 
pattern may hold true in this case, but Dirceu, who only 
recently was called the \"Prime Minister\" and the \"All 
Powerful\" is clearly diminished, and the PT has lost much of 
its hard-earned reputation for probity.  The separate case 
of 
Celso Daniel, the PT mayor murdered in 2002, and the 
reluctance by the party leadership to push a thorough 
investigation, also weighs against the PT.  If hard evidence 
of large-scale campaign finance abuses is found and linked 
to 
the highest levels of the PT (Dirceu was party president 
during the 2002 elections), the scandal could drag on for 
months.  The opposition parties, with their eyes on the 
October 2004 municipal elections, will also keep stirring 
the 
pot.  Damage has been done, but it is too early to say how 
much worse it will get.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL: 2003 GDP GROWTH EVEN WORSE THAN EXPECTED 
 
REFS: (A) Brasilia 450, (B) 03 Brasilia 3682 
 
1.  (U) The GoB has revised its 2003 growth number downward 
from its already twice-downscaled estimate of positive 0.3%, 
to negative 0.2%, Brazil\'s worst since 1992.  In addition to 
being half a percentage point below its own most recent 
forecast, the growth figure was below those of even the most 
pessimistic market analysts, whose last predictions were in 
the range of -0.1% to +0.3. 
 
2. (U) Parsing the numbers on the supply side:  the 5% 
growth in agriculture (9% of the economy) was insufficient 
to offset declines of -1% in industry (about 38% of the 
economy) and -0.1% in the services sector.  On the demand 
side, private consumption was down 3.3% and government 
consumption up a modest 0.6%, while investment fell 6.6% -- 
particularly concerning, given the need for infrastructure 
investment to reduce Brazil\'s economic bottlenecks, notably 
in transportation.  The only unalloyed positive was exports, 
up over 14% on the year, helped by the competitive effects 
of the Real\'s devaluation in 2002.

3.  (U) The GoB economic team, busily spinning the results, 
is pointing out the silver lining:  that growth rebounded to 
1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2003.  Agriculture as usual 
led the way on the supply side, with blazing 7.3% growth, 
followed by industry (1.2%) and services (0.8%).  Exports 
and investment led fourth-quarter demand-side growth. 
Exports grew 5.5%, and investment, encouragingly, grew for 
the second straight quarter (2.3% and 4%, respectively). 
Private consumption, the major component of demand, also 
rose for the second straight quarter, by 1.6%, after growing 
0.4% in the third quarter.  In extensive interviews over the 
weekend, Planning Minister Mantega and Treasury Secretary 
Levy maintained that these figures show the economy bottomed 
out sometime in the third quarter of 2003 and has been 
growing at a healthy clip since.  Lula has been quoted 
endorsing the same theme.  Even IMF Managing Director Horst 
Kohler, briefly visiting Brazil, got into the act, stating 
his belief that the Brazilian economy is on a \"firm 
foundation\" for substantial growth this year. 
 
4. (U) The GoB\'s argument is logical, but we have our 
doubts.  Multiple recent data points suggest the trajectory 
of economic growth in 2004 may prove far flatter than the 
1.5% growth of the fourth quarter of 2003 (slightly over 6% 
when annualized).  National unemployment has begun to climb 
again, to or towards new records, to 11.7% in January up 
from 10.9% in December (also up from 11.2% in January 2003). 
Per capita GDP was down 1.5% in 2003; this feeds through to 
average monthly incomes, down 6.2% in the twelve months 
ending in January 2004.  The Central Bank, after reducing 
its benchmark SELIC interest rate by 10 percentage points in 
the second half of 2003, has halted the decline in interest 
rates at 16.5%.  Given market expectations of 5.6% inflation 
over the next twelve months, this means a real interest rate 
of 10.9%, and commercial-bank spreads on lending to private 
entities remain far above even these double-digit levels. 
 
5.  (U) The trajectory of investment, up 2.3% in the third 
quarter of 2003 and a further 4% in the fourth quarter, is 
certainly promising.  But will it be sustained in 2004?  The 
national development bank (BNDES) reports that approvals for 
new financing were down 16%, and applications for financing 
down over 40%, year-on-year, in January; and according to 
the Central Bank total credit actually dipped from 25.4% to 
25.1% of GDP between December 2003 and January. 
 
6. (SBU) Admittedly, growth at even half the rate of the 
last quarter of 2003 would achieve the low end of the GoB\'s 
3-3.5% target for 2004.  A further question is the 
sustainability of even such moderate growth into the longer 
term.  By general consensus, this will depend on the GoB\'s 
timely achievement of a raft of proposed `microeconomic\' 
reforms to reduce the rigidities of the Brazilian economy 
and further overhaul public finances.  Expectations for 2004 
in this line were always limited, and there is now also the 
prospect that the current corruption scandals will weaken 
Lula\'s legislative hand or distract the Congress from 
economic reform (Septel).  In sum, the advent of a solid GDP 
upturn still seems based more on hope than on facts.

1.  A flurry of industry and press criticism has helped 
delay the Brazilian Senate\'s scheduled February 17 committee 
vote on the new energy model proposed by Minister of Mines 
and Energy Dilma Rousseff (reftels).  The bill sailed 
through Brazil\'s lower chamber with fairly insignificant 
revisions, but hit a roadblock during the Senate debate. 
Senators delayed the vote to March 3, after the Carnaval 
recess.  Unrelated legislative battles on whether to open a 
congressional investigation into allegations of Lula 
administration corruption, other legislative priorities, 
and, perhaps most of all, the intensifying protest from 
energy-sector associations, investors, companies, and 
lobbyists who now appear unanimously to oppose the bill in 
its current known form, may well further delay the vote. 
 
2.  Five energy-sector industry associations on February 19 
published appeals in Brazil\'s national press arguing that a 
future Brazilian energy crisis could be prevented only if 
the new energy bill were greatly altered.  In a much- 
publicized process, industry has lobbied specifically for 
eleven amendments that it calls critical to make the bill 
minimally acceptable and thus ensure the survival of the 
sector and attraction of private investment.  Minister 
Rousseff\'s reaction was to publicly reject all but four of 
the proposed amendments.  The February 25 edition of weekly 
magazine \'Isto E Dinheiro\' (`Fortune\'-equivalent) ran an 
article proclaiming that, \"Everyone is against Dilma,\" 
noting the fear that the new energy model would put too much 
power in the hands of the ministry, debilitate the energy 
regulator, prejudice existing investors, and repel new ones. 
 
3.  COMMENT.  Fifteen months into Lula\'s administration, the 
new GoB\'s energy model and rules for sector investment seem 
as bogged down as ever -- if not in fact moving in the wrong 
direction.  Minister Rousseff and the Lula administration 
chose to introduce the bill via Presidential Decree, 
presumably to propel the model through the Congress quickly. 
The political pushback from introducing it in this manner, 
however, coupled with the Minister\'s ever-more-widely- 
criticized alleged failure to accept input from industry 
stakeholders, has left the bill wallowing.  Given its 
apparent general unacceptability to virtually every affected 
part of the sector, a further delay in the Senate vote and 
debate might only be a plus.

SUBJECT: GOB EXTENDS SOLE ANTIDUMPING MEASURE AGAINST 
ARGENTINA 
 
REF:  BRASILIA 365 
 
1.  After holding discussions with Argentine officials 
February 19, the GOB decided to extend its minimum price 
antidumping measure against imports of Argentine powdered 
milk, which was due to expire on February 23.  Brazilian 
trade defense authorities decided to initiate a formal 
review of the price agreement that has been in effect since 
February 2001.  This is Brazil\'s only antidumping measure in 
effect against Argentina.  Instituted after the GoB 
determined that Argentine milk suppliers were selling below 
cost, it affects bulk imports of whole and nonfat powdered 
milk.  Following the February 19 decision, the Department of 
Commercial Defense (DECOM) noted that while Brazil\'s 
domestic industry showed significant positive development 
during the last three years, it had not reached the 
productivity level of \"important world producers,\" and 
agreed with petitioners that sufficient factors indicate the 
likely re-emergence of dumping and its associated damage 
should the price agreement expire. 
 
2.  The decision to review the price agreement (rather than 
let it lapse), published in the GoB Official Journal of 
February 20, allows the continuation of the minimum price of 
US$ 1,900 per ton of powered whole or nonfat milk from 
Argentina for a period of one year, during which the review 
is to be completed following WTO regulations.  Citing the 
effect of the Parmalat crisis on Brazilian milk producers, 
primarily family farmers, and the continued fragility of the 
industry, the Minister of Agricultural Development and the 
President of the National Commission of Milk Producers of 
the Brazilian Farm Bureau defended the move.  The powdered 
milk anti-dumping measures in effect against the EU, New 
Zealand, Argentina and Uruguay caused imports to drop from 
3.2 billion liters in 2001 to 500 million liters in 2003. 
Argentina and Uruguay together furnished 95 percent of 
Brazil\'s imported powdered milk in 2003.  The EU and New 
Zealand have been practically squeezed out of the Brazilian 
market; their imports totaled slightly more than 3 percent. 
The measure against Uruguay, also a price agreement, is due 
to expire in April 2004 and will also likely be extended 
pending review, according to Itamaraty trade officials. 
Measures against the EU and New Zealand (application of 
antidumping duty margins) remain in effect until 2006. 
 
3.  Comment:  The continuation of this agreement provides 
further evidence of Brazil\'s and Argentina\'s trade balancing 
act -- addressing local constituencies\' need for protection 
within the context of the Mercosul free-trade experiment and 
an internationally united negotiating bloc.  Unlike the 
recent bilateral trade difficulties with textiles, shoes and 
home appliances (reftel), this uncontroversial case has 
elicited little press coverage in the Brazilian media. 
Argentine milk suppliers presumably expected the antidumping 
price to continue and did not mount serious opposition, 
perhaps content with a larger share of the dwindling market 
now that competition from the Europeans and Kiwis has been 
effectively eliminated.  Argentine imports of subsidized EU 
milk and the subsequent re-export to Brazil -- the so-called 
triangle operation -- formed the basis for the GoB\'s 2001 
antidumping investigation.  While uninterested in seeking 
the dismissal of this measure, the GoB\'s emphasis on a trade- 
friendly atmosphere with Argentina should work toward 
preventing a second anti-dumping case in the near term.

Other legislative priorities delayed yesterday\'s (March 
3) scheduled vote on Brazil\'s new energy model (Ref A) by 
one day.  A Senate contact has told us the vote is expected 
to take place later today (March 4) after a plenary debate 
in the Senate, which we have confirmed was underway as of 
early-afternoon local time.  Industry representatives 
continue to lobby furiously, including the visiting Duke 
International President, who will meet with Minister of 
Mines and Energy Dilma Rousseff this afternoon with a 
request for eleventh-hour changes to render the new model 
less detrimental to current private investors.  It looks 
unlikely that industry will achieve any such major changes 
in the bill at this stage.  If it were to do so, the 
legislation would have to be returned to Congress\'s lower 
chamber for reconciliation and a further vote there.

SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN RESPONSE TO FTAA DEMARCHE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 44578 
 
Classified By: Economic Officer Janice Fair for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary 
------------- 
1. (C)  Econoff delivered reftel talking points to Regis 
Arslanian, Itamaraty Director for International Trade, and 
Tovar da Silva Nunes, Itamaraty FTAA Coordinator and member 
of the Brazilian Co-Chair team, on March 4.  In responding, 
they conveyed a constructive attitude, albeit without 
signaling a major change in Brazilian positions.  Both noted 
that Foreign Minister Amorim had repeatedly instructed the 
Ministry\'s technical level to \"be problem solvers\" so that 
the common set of rights and obligations, and the 
plurilateral procedures could be finalized.  Neither 
Arslanian nor Da Silva Nunes gave any indication that Brazil 
would retreat from concessions made by Mercosul during the 
course of the Puebla Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) 
meeting in February. 
 
2. (C)  Nunes suggested that U.S. and Brazilian Co-Chair 
teams would inevitably have to work together to draft a paper 
that would bridge current positions. He claimed that Chile 
had approached the Brazilian Co-Chair with the idea, saying 
that it would be necessary given the difficulty national 
delegations will have in moving off their respective 
positions.  He appeared anxious to start this process, 
perhaps immediately following the informal discussions in 
Buenos Aires March 9-10.  He also suggested that Co-Chairs 
should immediately explore how to minimize differences in the 
procedures paper, since time during the next Puebla meeting 
will be limited. 
 
3. (C)  While Nunes seemed to grasp the talking point without 
difficulty, Arslanian was initially confused by our 
suggestion that basic elements of the common set need to be 
decided, but that delegations should but this result at risk 
by attempting to resolve every issue in detail.  At first he 
mis-interpreted this as signaling U.S. willingness/interest 
in carrying over some discussion of common set elements (not 
just details) to a future TNC, even though Negotiating Groups 
would already be reconvening. He asked, for instance, if the 
U.S. would be willing to put off discussion of a special 
agricultural safeguard.  He emphasized that an adequate 
number of elements need to be defined so that Negotiating 
Groups have sufficient guidance to allow their work to 
proceed.   Econoff and EconCouns clarified that the point was 
simply not to let insistence on full resolution of every 
detail stand in the way of achieving agreement on \"the 
elements of the common set.\" 
 
4. (C)  Arslanian saw this issue as connected to the G-14 
proposal that the common set paper explicitly state that 
additional provisions may be included in the common set of 
rights and obligations in the future, as may be agreed. 
Nunes claimed that such a statement just isn\'t necessary, 
since any delegation has been and would remain free to raise 
any issue it so chooses.  Arslanian claimed his concern over 
this proposal was due to potential gridlock should 
delegations start raising new issues in the Negotiating 
Groups during common set discussions.  When Econoff inquired 
whether the provision would be less problematic if additional 
provisions were raised at the TNC level rather than in 
Negotiating Groups, Nunes answered \"maybe.\" 
 
Market Access 
------------------ 
5. (C)  Looking at the key areas of disagreement, Arslanian 
kept returning to market access, emphasizing that it is the 
crucial area for Brazil.  Specifically, he focused on 
proposed language for defining the scope for tariff reduction 
in the common set.  Brazil needs the proposed \"significant 
improvement in market access conditions\" language, Arslanian 
argued, to demonstrate that it is gaining something in the 
common set.  He also inquired about the possibility of 
commencing with Mercosul-US market access negotiations even 
if some elements of the common set remained undefined, such 
as the scope of tariff reduction.  Clarifying that we were 
not in a position to provide an official response, Econoff 
pointed out that past U.S. position was that agreement needed 
to be reached on the common set before these market access 
discussions could proceed. 
 
Agriculture 
-------------- 
6. (C)  Nunes went through the common set elements on 
agriculture.  On export subsidies, he said he was trying to 
explore formulations that address the U.S. interest in 
linking the elimination of export subsidies and the 
deterrence of subsidized products from non-FTAA countries, 
but which don\'t make causality between them explicit.  His 
general idea is to present the concepts as a package -- 
export subsidies are eliminated, and there are efforts at 
deterrence -- but the former (elimination) is not predicated 
on the latter (deterrence).  He also wondered aloud whether 
the definition for export subsidies could be left for the 
Negotiating Group on Agriculture to decide. 
 
7. (C)  As a matter of principle, Mercosul does not believe 
there should be any product differentiation with regard to 
safeguards; agricultural products should be dealt with under 
the same mechanism as industrial products, according to 
Nunes.  He claimed that Mercosul had had \"bad experiences\" 
with Andean trading partners, leading them to conclude that 
special agricultural safeguards are too prone to use for 
protectionist purposes.  Neither Nunes nor Arslanian 
responded directly when Econoff suggested that rather than 
rejecting a special agricultural safeguard outright, perhaps 
Mercosul\'s concerns about possible abuse could be addressed 
in the specifics of how the safeguard mechanism would operate 
-- a level of detail beyond what is sought in the common set 
document. 
 
8. (C)  On domestic support, Nunes claimed that it would be 
very difficult for Mercosul to accept elimination from the 
common set document of any reference to \"mechanisms to 
neutralize the effects of distorting measures...\"    Drawing 
on points in reftel, EconOff reffirmed that the U.S. is not 
prepared to address domestic support within the FTAA and we 
see this as an area in which Mercosul ambition must be 
lowered.  Nunes said that he is discussing the issue with 
Mercosul colleagues to find out the exact needs of the group, 
and claimed it was helpful to know that language on a 
neutralization mechanism relating to domestic support was a 
non-starter for the United States. 
 
AD/CVD 
----------- 
9. (C)  Nunes claimed that this was not a problematic area, 
in that Mercosul had backed off trying to obtain changes to 
U.S. legislation. 
 
Environment and Labor 
---------------------------- 
10. (C)  Nunes and Arslanian expressed surprise that the USG 
had not pushed for explicit labor and environment language in 
the common set document.  Nunes said that they figured the 
G-14 proposal for language on the Technical Committee on 
Institutional Issues (TCI) was designed to allow for 
introduction of provisions within the TCI Chapter.  Nunes 
said there was recognition that the USG is under TPA mandate 
to seek inclusion of these issue areas and suggested that it 
may be possible to formulate text for the common set document 
that would leave that door open for possible future 
consideration of proposals on labor and environment 
provisions, while not highlighting the opening.  For 
instance, he offered that one possibility may be to eliminate 
both \"exclusively\" and \"but not limited to\" from the various 
TCI text proposals. 
 
Private Sector Reactions 
------------------------------- 
11. (U)  In recent weeks, both the Brazilian Business 
Coalition (CEB), a broad based group formed to consult with 
the GOB on trade matters, and agroindustry groups have 
appealed to Itamaraty for flexibility so as to secure greater 
market access concessions from the United States.  Brazilian 
agroindustry has been most vocal, admonishing Itamaraty for 
its ideological stance on industrial policy, and pushing for 
increased GOB concessions in services, investment and 
government procurement. 
 
12. (U)  In a paper submitted to Itamaraty on February 27, 
the CEB reportedly reiterated the private sector\'s objective 
of obtaining concrete results in the negotiation, and its 
understanding that to achieve this Brazil would have to 
demonstrate greater flexibility.  The CEB is said to have 
made the following specific recommendations: market access - 
Itamaraty should show flexibility regarding its initial 
proposal for total tariff elimination by accepting that a 
small number of products would be subject to tariff 
reduction, rather than tariff elimination; services - the GOB 
should present a single offer, rather than pursue market 
access bilaterally (regional MFN upon entry into force) and 
commit to GATS-plus in terms of market access and national 
treatment; and on investment - recommends a market access 
agreement restricted to investment rights and negotiated on 
the basis of a single offer which also covers investors 
without a physical presence. 
 
Comment 
----------- 
13. (C)  The constructive attitude espoused by Arslanian and 
Nunes in this latest meeting is consistent with what we see 
as a more positive GOB stance toward the FTAA post-Miami. 
Despite negotiating positions designed to maximize the 
outcome for Brazil/Mercosul, the GOB has publicly and 
privately stressed its seriousness in working to gain 
consensus on the common set, and on plurilateral procedures 
so that negotiations can move forward.  Foreign Minister 
Amorim appears to be attaching considerable significance to 
implementation of the compromise framework he \"personally\" 
formulated with USTR Zoellick, so that long awaited market 
access negotiations with the United States can move forward. 
 
14. (C)  Caution may be in order in, however, in evaluating 
Nunes\' suggestions and ideas, which do not always reflect 
accepted thinking within the GOB, let alone Mercosul. 
Likewise, it is not clear whether his enthusiasm for drafting 
Co-Chair proposals is shared by the Brazilian Co-Chair, 
Ambassador Adhemar Bahadian. 
 
15. (C)  Despite the heightened pressure being exerted by 
parts of the Brazilian private sector following the February 
Puebla TNC, neither Arslanian nor Nunes mentioned any 
possibility of increasing Mercosul\'s level of ambition in 
services, investment, government procurement, or IPR in 
return for greater USG flexibility on market access.  Public 
statements by Antonio Simoes, Minister Amorim\'s economic 
advisor, also point to Itamaraty rejection of arguments that 
minimalist concessions in these areas are impacting the 
market access concessions being offered by the U.S. and 
others.  Post does not expect these private sector appeals to 
have much impact on Itamaraty positions in next week\'s 
discussions in Buenos Aires or in the TNC meeting in Puebla.

1.  The Brazilian Senate on March 4 approved the new energy 
model with some changes sought by the energy sector.  The 
most favorable change pertains to the definition of \"new 
energy\" and \"old energy,\" a point that determines to which 
of two energy pools power plants must sell.  The bill as 
passed by the lower chamber mandated that any generation 
plant in operation before January 1, 2003 would have to 
compete in \"old energy\" auctions with plants that had 
already been amortized, i.e., on a less favorable footing. 
The Senate version pushed back the date to January 1, 2000, 
helping the majority of plants which started construction 
after privatization in 1998.  This change would allow 29 
hydroelectric plants and 19 thermoelectric plants to compete in new energy auctions that would be considered \"old energy\" in the lower-chamber version. 
 
2.  However, even the bill passed on March 4 may not prove 
to be the final Senate-approved version.  Reflecting a 
peculiarity of Brazil\'s legislative process, there will be 
further separate Senate votes on a series of extra 
amendments to the bill.  Neither the number nor the nature 
of these amendments are publicly known, but they evidently 
represent private industry representatives\' last shot at 
inserting what they have described as essential changes for 
the survival of adequate conditions for sector investment. 
 
3.  The big losers in the new energy model as passed by the 
Senate so far are the distributors.  Tariffs are to be based on auction prices, and the distributors will not be allowed to pass on all of their costs to the consumers.  Also on the losing side were the opponents of the energy-model\'s prohibition of \"self-dealing\" (direct energy sales from generation to distribution operations of vertically 
integrated companies.) 
 
4.  The Senate-passed version now must go back to the 
Chamber of Deputies for the latter to consider its new 
provisions.  Separately, the Senate is scheduled to vote 
Tuesday, March 9 on the further amendments, as well as 
separately on Presidential Decree 145 (specific legislation 
to create an Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica (EPE), the data 
collection body akin to the United States Energy Information 
Agency.)

SUBJECT: BRAZIL CONSIDERS EFFECT OF IMF-ARGENTINA STANDOFF 
 
REF: BRASILIA 463 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Roman Wasilewski, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) The GoB has yet to really focus on what effect an IMF-Argentina train wreck would have on Brazil and the rest of Latin America, according to the IMF Resident Representative (protect).  The Resrep, opining that the IMF was equally uncertain on the subject, held out hope that the market had learned to distinguish between Argentina and the rest of Latin America.  Unlike the case of the Russian financial crisis, which touched off an emerging markets sell-off that ultimately forced the Cardoso administration to float the Real in early 1999, the IMF Resrep recalled that Brazil\'s currency and equity markets had notably detached from the steep dive in Argentine markets in November 2001.  Nevertheless, he offered no predictions about the market-fallout for Brazil and the rest of the continent of an Argentina-IMF collision.  He treated it as probable that the unexpected substitution of MD Kohler by DMD Anne Krueger at this crux of IMF\'s negotiations with Buenos Aires would only make the atmosphere more difficult and uncertain. 
 
2. (C) Coming against the backdrop of negative Brazilian growth in 2003 (reftel), falling real incomes and an 
unprecedented fiscal squeeze to pay the interest on its debt, an Argentina-IMF compromise that blesses a substantial debt reduction would promise political headaches for the GoB, the IMF Resrep agreed.  Contrasted with the situation in Brazil, the combination of resurgent Argentine economic growth and an IMF-blessed debt write-off would prove a powerful example for those asking what Brazil\'s reward is for being sufficiently fiscally prudent to honor its debt.  Despite such headaches, the Resrep did not believe Brazil would depart from its current economic policy course.  He was likewise confident, based on former MD Kohler\'s meeting last weekend in Brasilia with President Lula and the results of the recent IMF mission, that there was zero substance to claims of a Brazil-Argentina debtors\' negotiating block being formed. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  The GoB and Lula are concerned enough about the fallout -- both political and economic -- from an 
Argentina-IMF collision for Lula to have called the White House on Argentina\'s behalf Tuesday, March 2.  Whatever the 
IMF/Argentina outcome, the GoB may feel at risk of collateral damage:  almost any compromise -- regardless of the size of the \"haircut\" private investors take -- will be used by some political elements here to question the GoB\'s current economic policies.  We agree with the IMF Resrep, however, that the GoB is not about to embark on, nor contemplating, a radically different policy course.  The real danger is that a PT weakened by corruption scandals and a perceived failure to deliver on economic growth will be unable to push through the Congress the structural and microeconomic reforms this 
economy needs to unleash its potential.

This cable is Sensitive but Unclassified, please protect 
accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  The GoB hopes to use current relatively 
positive market sentiment and stronger foreign exchange 
rates to quietly rebuild reserves.  In contrast to very 
active reshaping of its domestic debt profile, the GoB has 
been fairly passive on external debt management.  While the 
recent unprecedented rise in value of Brazil\'s C-bond has 
created the opportunity for the GoB to repurchase these 
instruments, this seems unlikely at a point where the GoB is 
trying to rebuild reserves.  Meeting total public and 
private foreign amortizations of $43.9 billion in 2004 is 
not expected to be a problem.  End Summary. 
 
C-bonds 
------- 
 
2. (U) Lula\'s success in reassuring international financial 
markets of the prudence of his macroeconomic policies has 
given Brazil new openings to tap international markets, as 
illustrated by its January 2004 30-year Eurobond issued at 
377 basis points above U.S. Treasuries.  This issuance was 
all the more remarkable since Brazilian bonds traded at 
spreads of 24% above U.S. Treasuries little over a year 
earlier.  Despite this, the GoB does not plan significant 
net new foreign debt issuance, using new issues primarily to 
roll over maturing foreign debt to avoid drawing down 
reserves.  The GoB has also been engaging in significant FX 
purchases to build reserves and smooth the exchange-rate 
effect of an April 2004 spike in foreign debt amortization. 
 
3. (SBU) A Central Bank Director told Econoff February 19 
that investment banks were pitching him on an almost daily 
basis with various schemes to buy back Brazil\'s benchmark C- 
bonds, the most liquid of Brazil\'s Brady bonds.  The C- 
bonds, the product of an early 1990s\' foreign-debt 
restructuring, reached 100% of their face value in February. 
This opened up the practical possibility of repurchasing all 
or part of the USD 6.5 billion in outstanding C-bonds.  The 
CB Director explained that the GoB has the option of 
repurchasing these bonds at the time of their biannual 
coupon payments (April and October), but must announce its 
intention to do so during a thirty-day window beginning 
sixty days before the coupon payment date. 
 
4. (SBU) The C-bonds have since dropped below 100% of face 
value, complicating any repurchase deal.  The Central Bank 
Director noted in our February meeting, however, that it 
would not make much sense to attempt a repurchase on the 
scale required to redeem the C-bonds at a time when Brazil 
is trying to rebuild reserves.  If the right deal to swap 
the C-bonds for new, cheaper debt presented itself, however, 
the GoB might well take it, our interlocutor said. 
 
Amortizations for the Year 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Managing Brazil\'s foreign public debt in 2004 should 
not pose a challenge.  The GoB has been working to manage 
the impact of this year\'s total $43.9 billion in public and 
private foreign debt amortizations on the exchange rate. 
The Finance Ministry is making use of a new rule that 
doubles to 180 days the horizon during which the Treasury 
may purchase foreign exchange for upcoming debt repayments. 
This allowed it to use stronger November and December 
exchange rates and lower seasonal foreign exchange demand to 
purchase dollars well in advance for the spike of public- 
debt amortizations of $4.3 billion in April.

6. (U) Combined with market expectations as of January 2004 
of a current-account deficit of 0.5% of GDP ($2.55 bn) and 
total private and public debt amortization of $43.9 bn, 
Brazil\'s total external financing requirements this year are 
forecast at$46.49 bn.  Officially, this financing need is to 
be met through expected foreign investment inflows of $11 
bn, leaving $35.3 billion to be met through a combination of 
debt rollovers, potential net new issuances of external 
debt, use of reserves and purchases of dollars.  Better than 
expected dollar inflows should reduce the financing need: 
net dollar inflows of $1.3 billion in February brought year 
to date inflows to $4.7 billion.  To smooth its debt 
repayment in the longer term, the GoB agreed with the IMF at 
the time of the extension of its IMF agreement in November 
2003 to delay by one year each of two repurchases of SDR 4 
billion (about US$5.5 billion) arising in 2005 and 2006. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. (SBU) While Brazil\'s overall debt profile is a continuing 
concern, its public foreign debt is in better shape, being 
of both longer term and lower interest rates than Real- 
denominated debt.  Strong foreign-exchange inflows, 
primarily due to the continued surprisingly strong trade 
surplus, should continue to cushion foreign debt 
amortizations for both public and private debt.

SUBJECT: LULA\'S PERSONAL APPROVAL UNSCATHED BY RECENT 
SCANDAL 
 
REFS: A) BRASILIA 0458 
 
      B) BRASILIA 0402 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  The administration of Brazilian President Lula 
da Silva is facing the worst crisis of its fifteen months in 
power, yet Lula\'s personal approval rating remains at 60%, 
according to a recent poll.  However, his government\'s 
approval number stands at 38%, suggesting that Lula will 
have to expend greater personal and political effort to move 
legislation and to maintain popular support for his agenda. 
The difference in the numbers also demonstrates Lula\'s 
personal charisma, though this alone is unlikely to be 
enough to ensure his administration\'s success.  As it now 
appears the worst of the scandal is abating, Lula and his 
government emerge with a tarnished reputation and reduced 
political capital, both in Congress and with the public. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
LULA AT 60%, BUT HIS GOVERNMENT AT 38% 
-------------------------------------- 
2.  The personal popularity of President Lula da Silva 
remains high (60%) despite the rash of bad press from the 
recent \"Waldomiro Diniz scandal\" involving a senior aide 
caught soliciting bribes from a numbers racketeer (refs A 
and B).  A nationwide poll released March 2 by Datafolha 
showed that Lula\'s personal approval remains at the same 
level as it was in October 2003 (and nearly the same as the 
61% of the popular vote he received in the October 2002 
elections).  Most Brazilians do not believe that Lula is 
linked to or knew about Diniz\'s corruption. 
 
3.  As always, Lula personally is much more popular than his 
administration.  The approval numbers for Lula\'s government 
have slipped steadily since taking office, dropping again 
from 42% in December 2003 to 38% on March 2 (though this 
change is within the margin of error).  In response to 
specific questions about the Diniz scandal, 81% of 
respondents believe there should be a congressional inquiry 
(which Lula\'s PT party vigorously opposed and managed to 
kill on March 4); 43% think Lula\'s powerful Chief of Staff, 
Jose Dirceu (for whom Diniz worked) should step aside during 
the investigation; and 24% believe Dirceu should step down 
permanently.  Lula has reportedly refused Dirceu\'s offered 
resignation. 
 
4.  The scandal is not the only thing weighing down the 
government\'s approval numbers.  An economy that remains 
sluggish despite fiscal belt-tightening (and controversial 
pension reforms passed in December) has not helped the 
administration\'s popularity.  The Datafolha poll also notes 
that many Brazilians (36%) do not see President Lula as a 
hard worker, an increase over the 21% who held this opinion 
last year.  This may be a function of his frequent 
international travels.  Yet Ricardo Antunes, a Professor of 
Sociology at the University of Campinas in Sao Paulo, 
commented to the press that Lula\'s populist style enables 
him to communicate effectively with the working class, and 
therefore this segment of the population will give him more 
time to show results, in a sense give him a longer 
honeymoon. 
 
5.  The March 2 polling numbers also show that the 
popularity of the government has fallen regardless of 
region.  In the prosperous southeast (which includes the 
economic centers of Sao Paulo and Rio) the government\'s 
approval fell from 37% in December to 31% on March 2.  In 
the poorer northeast, the numbers slipped from 47% to 42% in 
the same period. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6.  Waldomiro Diniz was a senior advisor to Jose Dirceu, 
Lula\'s closest and most powerful advisor.  Dirceu has been 
diminished by the scandal, though he is not personally 
implicated.  Yet Lula continues to rise above the image of 
his party and his administration.  The Datafolha numbers 
show that his personal popularity is a remarkable 22 points 
higher than that of his government.  This dynamic has caused 
press and pundits to speculate on how long Lula\'s popularity 
balloon can sustain the deadweight of a sluggish economy and 
controversial political reforms.  With the Diniz scandal 
making matters even worse for the government, some believe 
that the GoB may be forced to make concessions, either on 
fiscal austerity or on controversial pieces of legislation, 
in order to maintain popular and congressional support.  To 
date, this is just speculation, and Lula has given no sign 
that he will cave in to political pressures.  In fact, even 
in the wake of the latest dismal GDP figures, Lula again 
reasserted his long-term commitment to Finance Minister 
Palocci\'s austerity program.

Classified By: POLOFF RICHARD REITER, FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  On March 4, Brazil\'s Workers\' Party (PT) 
quashed efforts to set up a congressional inquiry (CPI) into 
the gaming sector and the \"Waldomiro Diniz\" scandal (refs 
A,B).  This, coupled with the fact that no new allegations 
pointing to wrongdoing by PT leaders have emerged in recent 
days, suggests that the worst of the scandal has passed. 
Lula\'s Chief of Staff, Jose Dirceu, was emboldened to give a 
defiant press interview in VEJA magazine.  The post-mortem 
shows that the winners include PMDB Senator Jose Sarney, who 
gave key support to the administration in quashing the CPI. 
Losers, aside from Dirceu, include PT Senator Aloizio 
Mercadante and PL Senator Magno Malta.  Other big losers are 
the nation\'s more than 120,000 bingo parlor employees put out 
of work when Lula closed the parlors February 20. 
 
2. (C) And of course the Workers\' Party has lost political 
capital.  It is too early to say whether the scandal will 
hurt the PT in October\'s municipal elections, but it is 
likely to slow the legislative agenda in an already 
compressed congressional year.  The PT may also emerge more 
dependant on its coalition partners (who will extract maximum 
benefits in return), particularly the PMDB, which was 
instrumental in saving the PT from worse disgrace.  The PT\'s 
poor response to the crisis is in part due to its 
inexperience with ethics scandals, but the party is likely to 
discover that learning these lessons is politically 
expensive.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY GETS PUT IN A DRAWER 
------------------------------------------ 
3. (SBU) On March 4, three weeks after the \"Waldomiro Diniz\" 
scandal broke --in which a senior advisor on President Lula\'s 
staff was caught soliciting bribes from a numbers racketeer-- 
the Workers\' Party used a parliamentary tactic to quash 
efforts to establish a congressional inquiry (CPI).  The CPI 
was sponsored by Senator Magno Malta, of the coalition\'s 
Liberal Party.  On March 4, Malta filed his petition with the 
Senate leadership, but the fix was already in.  Senate 
President Jose Sarney, a leader of the coalition\'s PMDB 
party, went ahead and authorized the CPI, but then neither 
the PT nor the PMDB nominated their members to the committee. 
 Without a quorum, the committee could not be established 
and, in the lexicon, was \"put in a drawer\".  Investigations 
by the Federal Police, the Federal Prosecutor, and the Rio 
state assembly still continue.  With the CPI threat gone, and 
the fact that no new allegations against PT leaders have 
emerged in recent days, the worst of the scandal appears to 
have blown over. 
 
JOSE DIRCEU FINALLY GOES PUBLIC 
------------------------------- 
4. (U)  In fact, Lula\'s embattled Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu, 
for whom Waldomiro Diniz worked, felt emboldened enough to 
make his first public statement when he gave a long interview 
for the March 10 issue of VEJA magazine.  Defiant, Dirceu 
wondered why the opposition politicians who now say they have 
known about Diniz\'s malfeasance for over a year did not raise 
the issue earlier.  Saying that he made a mistake in trusting 
Diniz but committed no crime, Dirceu confirmed that Lula 
refused his offer to resign.  He insisted that the scandal is 
not an \"institutional crisis\" and that the Workers\' Party 
maintains its \"standard of ethical behavior and transparency\". 
 
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA A TOUGH SELL 
------------------------------- 
5. (C)  The Lula administration and the PT have not emerged 
unscathed.  Lula\'s personal approval remains at a teflon 60%, 
but his government\'s popularity has slipped to 38% (ref C). 
Even PT politicians tell us that the administration will have 
to work harder to sell its bills in Congress and may have to 
offer more pork to coalition allies.  Congress is now turning 
to its legislative agenda (one PT Federal Deputy told us that 
when the PT caucus in the lower house held its weekly meeting 
on March 9, crisis management was not even on the agenda), 
which in the coming weeks will include the Energy Model, 
Public-Private Partnerships, a Bankruptcy Law, follow-on 
legislation for last year\'s tax and pension reforms and 
possibly judicial reforms.  (A bill to reform campaign 
financing, which got an early boost from the scandal, has 
once again been put on the back burner.)  The legislative 
plate is full of tough bills, and with municipal elections 
set for October, Congress will essentially stop working when 
it goes into recess on June 30. 
 
WINNERS... 
----------- 
6. (SBU) The post-mortem on the scandal is still being 
written, but there are some clear winners and losers.  Among 
the winners are Senate President Jose Sarney (PMDB) who 
provided sound advice and procedural support in helping the 
administration quash the CPI.  Rumors that Sarney will be 
rewarded by getting to name the next head of Electrobras have 
resurfaced, and it is rumored that the PT will support 
Sarney\'s bid to amend the constitution to allow him to remain 
as Senate President through 2006.  Similarly, leading PMDB 
Senator Renan Calheiros and Chamber Speaker Joao Paulo Cunha 
(PT) worked hard on the administration\'s behalf and will 
expect recognition.  Meanwhile, former-Rio Governor Anthony 
Garotinho, who came in third in the 2002 presidential 
elections, is positioning himself for another presidential 
run in 2006.  Though Garotinho heads Rio\'s PMDB branch --and 
the PMDB is part of Lula\'s coalition-- he did not miss the 
opportunity to slam the administration over the Diniz 
scandal. 
 
...AND LOSERS 
------------- 
7. (C) The list of losers from the Diniz scandal must start 
with Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu.  He appears to have dodged 
the bullet, in that there is no evidence that he was 
personally involved in corrupt activities.  But Diniz worked 
for him, and there are still unanswered questions about 
Dirceu\'s role in both the Diniz and Celso Daniel (ref D) 
cases.  Dirceu is convinced that another member of Lula\'s 
inner circle, Communications Secretary Luiz Gushiken, tried 
to undermine him with tactical leaks over the past weeks, and 
Lula reportedly had to mediate their dispute.  In a March 2 
poll (ref C), two-thirds of Brazilians said Dirceu should 
step down, either temporarily or permanently, from his post. 
 
8. (SBU) Leading PT Senator Aloizio Mercadante also came out 
badly.  It was he who gave disastrous tactical guidance to 
the PT caucus in the Senate that nearly resulted in the CPI 
being established.  (There is some speculation that 
Mercadante may be replaced by Calheiros as the coalition\'s 
floor leader in the Senate.)  Liberal Party Senator Magno 
Malta, leader of the PL\'s Senate caucus, was badly damaged by 
his insistence on requesting the CPI, despite the fact that 
the administration and PL leadership were opposed.  (The PL 
is a coalition member and the party of Vice President 
Alencar.) Malta gave a tearful mea culpa on the Senate floor 
on March 9, but he may be forced out of his leadership 
position, if not out of the party altogether. 
 
BINGO PARLORS OUT OF LUCK 
------------------------- 
9. (C) Bingo parlors are losers, and an estimated 120,000 or 
more gaming employees are out of work.  On February 20, Lula 
issued a decree closing all bingo games and slot machines in 
Brazil.  Bingo was originally legalized in 1993 to allow 
gaming houses to affiliate with sports clubs and donate 7% of 
their revenues to the clubs\' upkeep.  However, many clubs 
complain that they never received the promised bingo 
revenues.  PT Federal Deputy Jose Eduardo Cardozo told us the 
system is \"a fraud\", and the bingo parlors are simply money 
laundering operations.  PT floor leader Arlindo Chinaglia 
assured us that Congress will support Lula\'s decree (which 
must be approved by Congress to remain in force), and no 
thought is being given to reopening the parlors anytime soon. 
 
WORKERS\' PARTY IMAGE TARNISHED 
------------------------------ 
10. (C)  And of course the Workers\' Party has lost political 
capital.  It is too early to say whether the scandal will 
have an impact on October\'s municipal elections, and there 
are still seven months for the party to recover, but the 
declining popularity of the PT-led administration indicates 
that the party has suffered a black eye.  The PT\'s code of 
ethics is more than just image (of 76 members of Congress who 
are currently defendants in criminal or electoral cases, none 
is a PT member), but the spate of bad press is damaging, and 
PT candidates will be hard-pressed to point fingers at their 
opponents\' misdeeds in the election run-up. 
11. (C) The PT showed itself inexperienced in crisis 
management, precisely because it is rarely faced with ethical 
crises.  The fact that it was saved by behind-the-scenes 
support from figures like Senators Jose Sarney and Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes, both widely perceived as 
ethically-challenged, but who have therefore developed superb 
crisis management skills, is surely not lost on the public or 
the Workers\' Party rank-and-file.  The PT learned some tough 
lessons that it hoped never to need, and finds itself 
diminished as a result. 
 
COMMENT - PT NOW A HOSTAGE? 
--------------------------- 
12. (C) Pundits here wonder whether, and to what extent, the 
PT now finds itself held hostage by its coalition allies. 
The large PMDB party, in particular, is never shy about 
demanding pork, the right to fill federal job vacancies, 
compromises on controversial legislation, and now deals on 
local-level coalitions in the upcoming elections.  One PT 
Deputy told us with a sigh that campaign finance reform and 
labor reform will not pass this year because the PT will have 
to limit its exposure on controversial bills.  There still 
may be time and political capital to pass important 
legislation, but the expectations have been sharply reduced 
by the scandal.  This is surely not how Lula and the PT 
wanted to begin their second year.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY 
 
 
1.  (U) Econoff delivered reftel talking points on March 10 
to Piragibe Tarrago, Chief of the Economics Department within 
Brazil\'s Foreign Ministry, Itamaraty.  Tarrago\'s Department 
has the lead on trade-related aspects of the UNCTAD 
declaration; he also reports directly to Ambassador Hugueney, 
Brazil\'s lead WTO negotiator.  After explaining USG concerns, 
Econoff left a copy of the March 4 non-paper with Tarrago. 
Also accompanying Tarrago was George Marques, an official 
identified as the contact for issues relating to the trade 
text.  Marques works in the Economics Department division 
dealing with economic organizations and can be contacted at 
gmarques@mre.gov; or 55-61-411-6912/6913; he speaks English. 
 
2.  (U) Tarrago claimed that Brazil appreciates the sensitive 
nature of the WTO Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations 
at this time and shares USG interest in ensuring that 
preparation for the XI UNCTAD conference does not create an 
environment that inflames that trade debate.  Tarrago 
admitted that the timing was \"unfortunate,\" noting that the 
UNCTAD conference is in June and the current target for 
completing DDA frameworks is July.  He said that when the 
UNCTAD conference was scheduled, the expectation was that the 
DDA negotiations would have progressed much further by now. 
 
3.  (U) Although Brazil shares USG interest in ensuring that 
the UNCTAD conference does not interfere with the DDA 
negotiations, the GOB does not think the current text should 
present major problems in this way.  Tarrago characterized 
UNCTAD as a think-tank organization whose role is to reflect 
in a more academic way on how trade impacts development, and 
to provide countries with useful information to help them 
gain the most from this connection.  Included in this debate 
would naturally be discussion of national policies, as well 
as a discussion of how international trade rules impact 
countries\' abilities to obtain trade benefits. He noted that 
WTO rules are necessarily an essential element of this 
discussion. 
 
4.  (U) Tarrago suggested that problems in the declaration 
text could be resolved through redrafting; Econoff explained 
the USG approach of organizing the text around three themes, 
eliminating certain proposed paragraphs, and the USG view 
that an exercise of redrafting the problematic paragraphs 
would be counterproductive because it would likely lead to a 
protracted and acrimonious debate.  Econoff noted that the 
USG does think it appropriate to include a general statement 
in support of the DDA negotiations. 
 
5.  (U) Tarrago pointed out that institutionally UNCTAD has 
no power over the WTO so it cannot \"renegotiate\" or 
\"reinterpret\" the Doha mandate.  However, he also seemed to 
acknowledge the point that institutional aspects aside, an 
UNCTAD ministerial declaration with text that can be 
interpreted as calling for a change in the Doha mandate would 
complicate the DDA negotiating environment. 
 
6.  (U) Tarrago concluded by emphasizing that the GOB does 
not want the UNCTAD conference and/or declaration to 
undermine the DDA negotiations.  He assured Econoff that the 
GOB will consider USG concerns in deciding how to approach 
the UNCTAD declaration text. 
 
SOUTH-SOUTH FREE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS 
 
7.  (U) In responding to Econoff\'s inquiry, Tarrago clarified 
reports concerning the launch of South-South free trade 
negotiations during the UNCTAD conference.  He said that 
discussions are on-going in Geneva with the aim of being able 
to officially announce at the UNCTAD conference the launching 
of trade preference (not free trade) negotiations, within the 
Generalized System of Preferences framework, for interested 
countries.  (Note, the GOB expects to finalize the 
India-Mercosul Preferential Trade Agreement by June 30 and 
may well take advantage of the UNCTAD conference to showcase 
the agreement as a model.) 
 
DDA MINI-MINISTERIAL 
 
8.  (SBU) Tarrago reported that the GOB is considering trying 
to organize a DDA mini-Ministerial to take place in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, coinciding with the XI UNCTAD conference.  He 
noted that a decision will depend on progress in DDA talks in 
Geneva, and that USTR Zoellick would be invited to attend 
should the GOB decide to convene such a meeting. 
9.  (SBU) Comment.  Since UNCTAD\'s Secretary General is 
Brazilian Ambassador Rubens Ricupero the GOB has a special 
relationship with the organization at this time, which may 
constrain GOB flexibility on the declaration text. 
Nonetheless, while Brazil is keen to demonstrate leadership 
on developing country issues in both the WTO (G-20) and 
UNCTAD fora, post believes that the GOB\'s main interest lies 
in achieving gains within the WTO.  If progress in the WTO 
DDA negotiations clearly appears to be threatened by the 
preparatory discussions for the XI UNCTAD conference, we 
would expect the GOB to adopt a pragmatic approach toward the 
UNCTAD declaration. End Comment.

2.  COMMENT:  Momentum of the Mercosul-India negotiations is 
likely to continue apace so as to produce a deliverable for 
signature by the June 30 target date, or perhaps even at the 
UNCTAD meeting in Sao Paulo in mid-June.  The SACU 
negotiations, initiated before those with India, seem to be 
finally coming out of hibernation.  The scope of the SACU 
agreement will probably mirror that of the Indian PTA, but 
addressing the needs of the smaller members of SACU will 
complicate and slow the negotiating process.  The existence 
of PTAs helps entice the private sector to explore these new 
markets and -- perhaps more importantly for the GoB -- 
demonstrates political commitment to improving relations 
with developing-country partners. 
 
3.  (Begin Text of Unofficial Embassy Translation) 
 
(HEADLINE) Agreement with India Should be Completed by June 
 
The director of Itamaraty\'s Department of International 
Negotiations, Regis Percy Arslanian, advised yesterday that 
the preferential tariff agreement between Mercosul and India 
should be concluded by June 30.  This agreement is 
considered the first step towards an effective free trade 
agreement and calls for the reduction of import tariffs on a 
number of items. 
 
The list of products presented by Mercosul to India for 
tariff reduction contains approximately 1700 items, while 
the Indian list has around 1600.  The first meeting to 
establish which products should be privileged in trade 
relations between Mercosul and India ended last Wednesday 
with the definition of 100 line items for each side.  This 
was an initial stage, just to test the waters, said the 
diplomat.  A further list of trade items to be opened up for 
trade will be exchanged on March 31. 
 
The Mercosul list includes some strong Brazilian trade items 
like leather, agricultural products, ethanol, soy oil and 
various kinds of meat.  Arslanian advised that this last 
product was also on the Indian list and was accepted by both 
sides. 
 
Despite the small quantity of products accepted by both 
parties given the list offered by each one, the diplomat is 
certain that negotiations will take a favorable tack in the 
long run.  \"Little by little the quantity will increase, but 
it is clear that not all of the 1700 products will be 
considered,\" he emphasized. 
 
The tariff levels to be allowed for the 100 products already 
accepted for each country have also not yet been defined. 
\"Neither we nor the Indians have completed consultations 
with the private sector.  At some point, we are going to 
define the margin of liberalization that we are going to 
offer\", said Arslanian.  In Brazil, these consultations will 
be done by the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign 
Commerce. 
 
Along with the definition of products, the governments of 
the Mercosul countries and India are trying to finish 
another three annexes to the free trade agreement: rules of 
origin, dispute settlement and safeguards.  The negotiations 
for this agreement were initiated during the trip President 
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva made to India in January. 
 
Itamaraty also revealed a note relative to the meeting of 
the Trilateral IBSA Dialogue (India, Brazil and South 
Africa) on the chancellor level that started yesterday and 
ends today in New Delhi, the Indian capital.  According to 
the document, the ministers discussed among other subjects, 
\"the reform of the UN and the situation in the Middle East, 
including the possibility of G-3 individual and group 
actions in support of peace between Israel and Palestine.\" 
 
Mercosul is also negotiating a preferential tariff agreement 
with the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) as a 
preliminary measure to a free trade agreement.  \"South 
Africa proposed finishing negotiations by March 31, but we 
are going to suggest another date in April,\" commented 
Arslanian.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S F-X PROGRAM: NO MATTER WHO WINS TENDER, 
MOD SUPPORTS EMBRAER 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Dennis Hearne, reasons 1.5 (a) & (d) 
 
-------------------------------- 
Embraer, a Winner No Matter What 
-------------------------------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  Although no announcement has been made on the 
selection of the Brazilian Air Force\'s (FAB) next high 
performance jet fighter, the F-X, the GOB could be setting 
the stage for a decision on the purchase of the 12 aircraft. 
In the F-X competition, Embraer is currently partnered with 
Dassault in offering the Mirage 2000-5. According to an \"O 
Globo\" press report, Minister of Defense Jose Viegas told a 
business audience that, regardless of the outcome of the 
competition, and even if it loses in its joint bid with 
Dassault, Brazil\'s aviation giant Embraer \"ought to be 
contracted to provide specific services\" to the winning 
consortium. 
 
2.  (SBU)  The F-X selection will be made by the National 
Defense Council in the presidency which has already 
received 
technical input from the MOD. The GOB has missed a number of 
self-imposed deadlines for a decision on the F-X, and the 
wait could be extended further. In discussing MOD 
procurement 
priorities, Minister Viegas said in the March 8 Sao Paulo 
Gazeta Mercantil that the F-X decision \"will be made this 
year\" -- a statement that hints an announcement may not be 
forthcoming soon. 
 
-------------- 
The U.S. Offer 
-------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  Lockheed Martin has given up its attempt to 
partner with Varig Engineering and Maintenance (VEM). A 
subsidiary of Varig, VEM was unresponsive to Lockheed 
Martin\'s proposed program to offer refurbished F-16s. 
Observers agree that Varig\'s current financial woes, and its 
epileptic merger effort with rival TAM, may have forced VEM 
to remain on the sidelines. While Lockheed Martin\'s F-16 
offer remains in the F-X competition, the company lacks a 
strong Brazilian mate in its tender and this likely limits 
Lockheed\'s prospects. 
 
4.  (C)  In a conversation March 10 with visiting CJCS 
General Myers, Minister Viegas commented that 
Lockheed-Martin\'s best and final offer (BAFO) for new F-16s 
left him with the impression the company \"was not serious\" 
about winning the competition.  The Minister also expressed 
concern about restrictions imposed by USG in case Brazil was 
to buy US weapon systems, in particular the AAMRAM missile, 
and appeared surprised when told the GOB had been provided 
written assurance from the USG that the AAMRAM is available 
without strings attached. The Minister also appeared unaware 
that the Netherlands had made available recently, for just 
$8 
million each, refurbished used F-16s that are comparable in 
performance to new aircraft. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  While the USD 700 million F-X program 
price tag still causes sticker shock, there is no indication 
at this time the Ministry of Defense will lower its 
aspirations for new rather than used aircraft.  But two 
trends appear evident: the GOB may be delaying a decision 
for 
budgetary or other reasons, and the eventual tender winner 
will have to give Embraer a piece of the action.

RATE UNEASE

1.  SUMMARY:  Amidst fresh inflation nerves over the pass- 
through of world commodity and domestic wholesale price 
pressures to the Brazilian retail level, the Central Bank 
(CB) is now expected to further delay new interest-rate cuts 
this week at its monthly COPOM meeting, perhaps at April\'s 
also.  Analysts are accordingly already shaving their 
forecasts of GDP growth in 2004.  Brazil\'s inflation data 
may be disputable; its lack of growth is not; and the CB\'s 
alleged over-caution is being ever more intensely pilloried. 
A typical commentary branded the current CB\'s disconnect 
from Brazil\'s real economy its widest since the previous GoB 
adopted inflation-targeting in 1999.  Lula\'s own PT issued a 
call for \"changes in economic policy\" after its latest 
Executive Committee gathering on March 4.  But Lula and his 
GoB fiscal team made PT president Genoino retract, and have 
reaffirmed more unflinchingly than ever their commitment to 
fiscal austerity in general and this year\'s 5.5% inflation 
target in particular.  Much of the market itself now views 
the 5.5% target as unrealistic, though.  A visiting top U.S. 
risk expert opined to us that low growth, by threatening GoB 
debt sustainability, poses a bigger financial risk than 
would relaxation of the inflation target within its existing 
band (upper limit: 8.0%.)  GoB toughness in holding the 
expectations line is understandable, but is it boxing itself 
into a too-rigid economic as well as political corner?  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Some worse-than-expected new inflation statistics have 
doused remaining hopes that the Central Bank will effect at 
least a symbolic interest-rate cut at its March COPOM 
meeting this week, and left the door open to doubt as to 
whether it will do so even in April.  In particular, the 
Getulio Vargas Foundation\'s IGP-DI inflation index for 
February came in at 1.08%, far over the 0.6-0.8% 
expectations.  The related IGP-M index for February 
subsequently emerged as 0.66%, up from January\'s 0.08%. 
Prime cause:  wholesale prices, which account for 60% of the 
IGP\'s base calculation.  Brazil\'s separate Wholesale Price 
Index (IPA) rose 2.2% in February after a 1.2% rise in 
January.  The latest Brazilian Institute of Geography and 
Economics\' IPCA (Broad Consumer Price Index) data also 
caused unease when released March 10.  The IPCA figure for 
February was 0.61%, down from January\'s 0.76%, but its 
wholesale and industrial components (cars in particular) 
were sharply up, as were administered prices. 
 
3.  NOTE:  Brazil\'s inflation history has made it rich in 
official price indicators.  The latter\'s variance is 
fuelling arguments about current trends.  The IGP-DI index 
dates back to 1944 and can thus be accused (with its 
siblings like the IGP-M) of embodying an obsolete, wartime, 
Brazilian economic model.  Being based 60% on wholesale 
prices makes it prey to the current ongoing surge in world 
commodity prices, for example.  Similarly, a recent media 
item averred that a third of the IPA wholesale index rise 
came just from world price hikes in soy oil (due to Chinese 
demand) and eggs (due to avian flu) -- the implication being 
that such events should not be allowed to sway Brazilian 
Central-Bank policy.  Brazil\'s broad consumer IPCA has been 
based since 1980 on purchases in nine cities by families 
with incomes of between one and forty minimum salaries; it 
is thus more directly determined than the IGP by domestic 
economic factors and interest rates.  Even so, February\'s 
IPCA result was bumped by an 8% jump in start-of-school-year- 
related administered prices.  Interest-rate doves argue that 
this one-time effect likewise skewed the overall current 
Brazilian trend. 
 
4.  A separate Rio consumer index depicted local retail- 
price deflation/deflation that month.  This and other signs 
of retail stability are adduced by the interest-rate doves 
as evidence that Brazil will resist pass-through of 
wholesale inflation because of consumers\' crippled real 
income and purchasing power.  But CB Chairman Meirelles 
claims GDP figures show robust growth is already underway in 
industry, requiring monetary tautness to preempt 
inflationary pressures, and points out that forward-looking 
real interest rates are already at their lowest since 1994. 
Critics charge that Meirelles is fixated on rigor for its 
own sake, and that the CB will just find more pretexts 
through the year, e.g., the effects of the new COFINS tax 
regime in May and of the next round of administered price 
increases in July-August, to hold off on SELIC cuts then, 
too.  END NOTE. 
 
5.  It may prove fleeting, but this inflation/interest-rate 
news has been dismally-timed for Lula and Brazil after last 
month\'s final GDP figure of -0.2% for 2003 (Ref B).  Various 
financial analysts are now putting off expectations that the 
steady decline of the Central Bank\'s benchmark SELIC rate 
from last June\'s 26.5% to December\'s 16.5% will resume even 
in April.  Some have accordingly already shaved their GDP 
growth projections for this year from the earlier consensus 
3.5-4% zone (Ref D).  Most others say they will do so unless 
further significant SELIC cuts resume by May.  Lula himself 
recently volunteered that 2004 growth \"may not be what we 
would have wished.\" 
 
6.  At the same time, more and more analysts are opining 
that the GoB\'s 5.5% inflation target for 2004 looks 
unattainable.  The behavior of Brazilian administered prices 
(telecommunications, power, etc) so far this year has 
already been discouraging.  But pessimists\' main assumption 
is that domestic retail-price levels will not much longer 
resist the impact of the ongoing rise of world commodity 
prices upon Brazil\'s wholesale-price level. 
 
7.  Along these lines, we recently heard the global-market 
risk expert for a top U.S. financial-house deem it ill- 
advised for the GoB to keep aiming at the 5.5% target.  The 
weight of external, wholesale and administered price 
pressures means the CB will have to keep the IPCA\'s `free- 
price\' component\'s increase below four percent, which would 
require a crushing CB interest-rate squeeze, in that 
expert\'s assessment.  He went on to opine that the GoB 
should not put inflation-target rigidity above growth 
considerations.  Brazil\'s future debt sustainability would 
be more damaged by puny growth in 2004 than by the GoB 
easing its inflation target upward within the existing 
official band, say, to 6.0-6.5% (the band\'s ceiling is 8%,) 
our visitor thought. 
 
8.  Attacks on the CB\'s slowness to renew cuts in the 
benchmark SELIC rate are ever more intense amongst the usual 
political and business quarters.  But they have also spread 
to include sectors and independent voices which stuck 
solidly to the CB through Lula\'s first year.  One 
conservative commentator has called the gap between the CB\'s 
view of the real economy, and that of the rest of Brazil, 
wider than at any time since the previous GoB first adopted 
inflation-targeting in early 1999. 
 
9.  Lula\'s own Workers\' Party (PT) emitted a statement 
calling for \"changes in economic policy\" after its latest 
Executive Committee meeting on March 4.  Palocci reportedly 
at once complained to President Lula, and Lula in turn 
phoned PT president Genoino to read the riot act.  Genoino 
dutifully denied that the PT statement had said exactly what 
it did say.  Former Labor Minister Wagner, now the head of 
the President\'s Council for Economic and Social Development, 
subsequently took his own public personal swipe at Palocci. 
 
10.  At least one national newspaper has peddled the line 
that Lula\'s Chief-of-Staff Dirceu is stoking intra-GoB 
criticism of Palocci\'s policies.  Aside from electoral 
considerations, this supposedly reflects Dirceu\'s self- 
serving strategy to recover from the personal damage of the 
unrelated Waldomiro Diniz scandal (Ref B).  We assess these 
rumors as just the latest Dirceu/Palocci fissure-mongering 
bunk. 
 
11.  Since the PT Executive Committee protest, Lula and 
Communications Secretary Gushiken have weighed in with 
repeated, undiluted support of Palocci\'s and Meirelles\' 
monetary/fiscal policies.  In the process, Lula has re- 
identified himself with their policies more definitively 
than ever.  During his first six months, Lula was not above 
grandstanding over interest rates, public-utility tariffs, 
and airy promises of a \"growth spectacular,\" in ways that 
may have left his ultimate views open to doubt.  But in his 
March 11 remarks, he broke new ground in stressing the GoB\'s 
long-term imperative of keeping an iron fiscal/monetary 
grip.  He re-endorsed the 4.25% budget-surplus and 5.5% 
inflation-target without qualification, commenting that even 
if the inflation target were loosened to six percent, 
\"people would demand seven.\"  He echoed Meirelles\' assertion 
that Brazil has never been so close to convergence of its 
inflation target with its actual performance.  He also 
stressed Meirelles\' point about the real SELIC rate, at 10% 
(forward-looking), being the lowest in a decade. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
12.  Lula\'s re-affirmation of total support for his Finance 
Minister and CB Chairman is all the more compelling in the 
context.  Still without concrete growth/job results to show 
for his first fifteen months, in a local-election year (a 
likely stimulus behind the PT leadership\'s protest), with 
the GoB lately at a new high of political discomfort due to 
scandal, and in the face of economic statistics that might 
well be argued as an excuse for policy easing -- Lula has 
nonetheless unambiguously committed himself neither to bend 
fiscally nor to join the widening chorus of those calling on 
the Central Bank to adopt a higher inflation target for this 
year.  At this juncture, the Lula/Palocci/Meirelles trio 
appears to have become as seamless a policy unit as its 
legendary FHC/Malan/Fraga predecessor.  That said, an 
announcement of good first-quarter GDP growth figures in 
April would it enormously easier for Lula to stay the 
course.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL: CJCS MEETING WITH INSTITUTIONAL SECURITY 
MINISTER FELIX, 10 MARCH 2004 
 
Classified By: DENNIS HEARNE, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. REASONS: 1.5 
(B)(D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. Brazil\'s senior security and intelligence 
official, Institutional Security Minister Jorge Felix, told 
visiting CJCS Myers on 10 March in Brasilia that 
narcotrafficking poses a grave threat to Brazilian national 
security.  The threat is manifest in international 
arms-for-drugs trafficking involving Brazilian organized 
crime gangs, in the spread of corruption in Brazilian 
institutions, and in widespread violence against the public. 
Felix expressed concern that narcotraffickers might place 
innocent civilians on their aircraft, for use as human 
shields against lethal force interdictions, and said such 
issues made the decision to implement the shootdown law a 
difficult one that the President must make.  Nonetheless, he 
reiterated the position that the GOB considers 
narcotrafficking to be a threat to national security.  On 
terrorism, Felix said Brazilian authorities have found \"no 
evidence\" of operational terrorist activities in Brazil, but 
said that the potential \"bears watching.\"  End summary. 
 
2. (U) CJCS General Richard Myers, accompanied by Charge, ORA 
Chief, DATT and JCS staff met with Minister Felix and senior 
officials of the Institutional Security Cabinet (Portuguese 
acronym GSI) at the Planalto Palace (Presidential offices) on 
10 March 2004.  The GSI is an interagency organization within 
the Presidency that functions, in roughly equivalent USG 
terms, as a combination NSC, ONDCP, DCI and general crisis 
management center.  A cabinet-level officer and general in 
the Brazilian army, Felix is in charge of the GSI and serves 
as the President\'s senior security and intelligence advisor. 
 
SHOOTDOWN 
 
3. (S) General Myers asked Minister Felix whether 
narcotrafficking represents a grave threat to Brazil\'s 
national security.  Felix responded that narcotrafficking 
does pose a major threat to Brazilian national security on 
both a \"wholesale\" and \"retail\" level.  Elaborating, Felix 
said that the \"wholesale\" threat is seen in the growth of 
international drugs for weapons trafficking between Brazilian 
criminal organizations and Colombian groups, and also in the 
spread of narcotics-related corruption through Brazilian 
institutions.  On the \"retail\" level, the dramatic level of 
hard drug use within Brazil is harming the population, in 
terms of health and exposure to increased criminal violence. 
 
4. (S) General Myers then asked Felix whether he was 
comfortable that implementing a shootdown law in Brazil would 
be a positive development.  Felix replied that he has some 
concerns that narcotraffickers \"will not play by the same 
rules as we do,\" and may react to shootdown measures by 
placing innocent women and children on narcotrafficking 
aircraft, for use as human shields against the use of lethal 
force in interdiction operations.  Such concerns make the 
GOB\'s decision to implement a difficult one that, Felix said, 
will have to be made by President Lula da Silva. However, 
Felix reiterated the position that narcotrafficking 
constitutes a grave threat to Brazilian national and public 
security. 
 
TERRORISM 
 
5. (C) Turning to the issue of terrorism, Felix said that in 
the years before the September 11 attacks the GOB had 
routinely declared that Brazil was free of terrorist 
activities.  Now, he said the GOB\'s position is that it has 
so far \"found no evidence\" of operational terrorist 
activities in Brazil.  He clearly stressed the concept of 
\"evidence\" -- as opposed to saying no such activity exists -- 
asking his interpreter to repeat this phrase with emphasis to 
the USG interlocutors.  The potential for increased terrorist 
activity in Brazil \"bears watching,\" Felix added. 
 
6. (S) Felix affirmed that operational cooperation between 
GOB and USG intelligence and security agencies is excellent. 
The tri-border area of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay is a 
\"complex area\" where various types of money laundering, 
counterfeiting and other clandestine activities overlap one 
another, Felix said. There is clearly potential for Islamic 
terrorist fund-raising within this shadowy mix, Felix said, 
but the GOB also must be careful to not tarnish unfairly the 
image of the more than eight million law-abiding Brazilians 
of Arab descent. 
 
7. (U) General Myers did not have the opportunity to clear 
this message.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S ONGOING DEBATE ON PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS 
 
Ref: 2003 Brasilia 3956 
 
Sensitive but unclassified; please protect accordingly. 
 
1. (U)  Summary:  The American Chamber of Commerce and \"Valor 
Economico\" newspaper sponsored a seminar in Brasilia March 10 
to stimulate the national debate on Public-Private Partnerships 
(PPPs), the method by which the GoB seeks private sector 
investment to help fund essential public services and 
infrastructure needs.  The seminar highlighted significant 
differences between government and private-sector expectations 
but also demonstrated a willingness on both sides to find the 
correct PPP recipe for Brazil.  It will clearly not be easy for 
the GoB to provide the kinds of assurances the private sector 
seeks, especially amid concerns about political risk and 
regulatory uncertainty.  The draft bill (PL 2546/2003) remains 
under debate in Congress, but the GoB has designated its 
passage a prime legislative priority.  The bill\'s sponsor, 
Deputy Paulo Bernardo (PT/PR), expects passage by the end of 
April, despite several controversial points still unresolved. 
The seminar participants included Joaquim Levy, the Secretary 
for the National Treasury at the Ministry of Finance, 
representatives from Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais State 
Secretariats, representatives of civil construction, 
 
SIPDIS 
sanitation, and highway construction firms, international 
consultants, banks and the IADB.  End Summary. 
 
The Legislation 
--------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Federal Deputy Paulo Bernardo started the seminar with 
an update on the status of the PPP bill (PL 2546/2003), 
originally fast-tracked to be approved during Congress\'s 
extraordinary session from mid-January to mid-February. 
Although a relatively short piece of legislation and not 
opposed by any political party, Bernardo noted the inherent 
complexity of the PPP bill due to its direct links and 
subordination to current laws like the Law of Fiscal 
Responsibility not sure this is accurate characterization - 
dispensable anyway, I think as well as those governing 
concessions and public procurements.  The issue of the 
guarantees to be offered remains among the most controversial. 
 
3. (U)  Bernardo said that questions over the constitutionality 
of the article stipulating PPP contracts\' precedence over the 
State\'s other contractual obligations forced the removal of 
that article.  However, he assured participants the necessary 
financial guarantees will be present in the final legislation 
through the fiduciary fund (the fund of state-owned assets 
meant to cover shortfalls in the government\'s PPP obligations) 
and the nature of PPP contracts themselves, even without 
establishment of the explicit precedence of PPP contracts in 
government obligations.  The Ministry of Planning is preparing 
new text to address the issue of precedence that may be voted 
on as an amendment.  The question of defining government PPP 
expenditures as recurring costs or debt is also under 
discussion.  The GoB seeks to have complementary state and 
federal PPP legislation, but already-passed Minas Gerais state 
legislation considers the state\'s PPP costs as recurring costs 
while Sao Paulo State Secretary for Planning, Andrea Calabi, 
told participants that state spending on PPPs would be 
considered debt and that, therefore, PPP projects would involve 
very little state money.  Many urged flexibility in the law so 
that government could evaluate each project individually. 
 
A New Concept 
------------- 
 
4. (U)  Bernardo spoke of the GoB\'s intention to change the way 
the government is viewed by the private sector, to put an end 
to the history of defaults, late payment, contract breaking, 
and changing of rules after the contract signing.  The MG and 
SP state secretaries also portrayed the PPP as a tool to change 
the culture of suspicion to a culture of trust, characterizing 
the partnerships as a new concept for Brazil, not yet fully 
formed, but an opportunity for the government to gain new 
respect as a reliable partner.  But how to make this admirable 
political will a reality?  Government representatives cited 
their challenges such as providing clear information and 
defined priorities, creating a can-do management style that 
values flexibility and tailors guarantees to the needs of 
specific projects.  Several underscored the point that project 
finance and traditional concessions still merit consideration, 
as PPPs will not fit every situation. 
 
5. (U)  Joaquim Levy, Treasury Secretary at the Ministry of 
Finance, said PPPs are useful tools for projects with greater 
social/economic gains than financial gains.  The benefits of 
long-term, high-quality service for the government/consumer 
balanced with guaranteed payment and reduced cost of investment 
for the private sector must be achieved while avoiding 
\"skeletons\" or concealed/unacknowledged liabilities.  Citing 
articles of the bill, he attempted to show that this outcome is 
entirely possible.  He described in general terms the 
regulations to govern the creation of the fiduciary funds (to 
be created by public financial institutions and to contain 
budgeted funds, stocks of state-owned companies, real estate 
and capital goods), noting that the fund will be separate from 
the Treasury and will not conflict with the government\'s 
primary surplus target.  He also explained that the PPP 
management agency, made up of representatives from the 
Ministries of Planning and Finance and from the Civil 
Household, will devise PPP contract procedures and determine 
priority projects, as well as authorize and evaluate bids for 
PPP contracts. 
 
6. (U)  Government representatives agreed that the legislation 
and operation of PPPs must offer a flexibility that does not 
currently exist.  The concession law prohibits the public 
sector from making partial payments to private service 
suppliers.  The public procurement law does not allow the 
private contractor to charge user fees and limits contracts to 
five years.  The challenge remains to provide that flexibility 
within the boundaries of fiscal constraints and in an 
atmosphere that the private sector perceives as rife with 
risks. 
 
Private Sector on Political Risk, Regulation 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) The Brazilian private sector participants welcomed 
the opportunity to share their experiences with government 
partnerships and their expectations for PPPS.  All agreed on 
the urgency of restarting investment in infrastructure and 
basic public services to promote economic growth and job 
creation.  Many praised the notions of shared risks and 
responsibilities and \"value for money\" that the PPP concept 
embodies.  Benefits that the private sector brings to the 
partnership include improved service, timely completion of 
projects, better risk evaluation and application of new 
technologies.  In addition to the payment guarantees that take 
into account the limitations of public debt, business reps said 
that a new regulatory framework is essential for the viability 
of PPPs. 
 
8. (SBU)  According to private sector participants, the 
framework should include measures that ensure confidence in the 
bidding process, clear project evaluation criteria and contract 
performance requirements, as well as guarantees of faithful 
execution of the proposals.  The PPP management entity should 
be charged with cutting through red tape, facilitating 
environmental permits, for example, and should make regular 
reports to Congress.  One participant cited the recent contract- 
breaking actions of the state of Parana, saying that as PPPs 
will be long-term contracts (10-25 years), they must be able to 
withstand the political winds of change.  Several participants 
emphasized the importance of wisely selecting the first PPP 
projects to build faith in the initiative and attract 
investors. 
9. (U)  Several private sector reps suggested prioritization of 
projects that rely on user fees or tolls rather than government 
payments.  This raised the question of whether rate adjustments 
would be handled differently for PPPs than for concessions. 
One representative of a construction firm suggested that the 
GoB investigate ways to reduce the tax burden on companies that 
undertake PPPs.  Questions arose regarding the selection 
process for projects, if and how PPPs could alter the current 
system of technical pre-qualifications in the public 
procurement law, perhaps exacerbating problems with the current 
law that contribute to collusion.  One international consultant 
suggested that the current public procurement process be 
altered for PPPs to allow for efficiency gains and lower final 
costs through acceptance of alternative technical proposals 
before the evaluation of economic offers. 
 
10. (U) There was also discussion of the need for separate 
regulatory frameworks for individual sectors.  A rep from a 
major highway construction firm suggested that PPPs for 
highways be complementary to Brazil\'s existing (and successful, 
according to this source) program for highway concessions, 
which already has its own laws and regulations.  Some expressed 
doubts that PPPs would be viable for ports and railroads as 
well as for hospitals and schools.  Sanitation and water- 
treatment projects are prime PPP candidates, but Brazil lacks a 
regulatory framework for this sector, where municipalities are 
responsible for providing service.  A representative from an 
international firm specializing in sanitation services said 
that creation of sanitation-specific regulatory bodies on the 
federal, state, and municipal levels is required to guarantee 
the sanctity of contracts.  He described difficulties with 
contested rate adjustments and suspended service, and noted 
that Brazil\'s notoriously slow judicial process compounds the 
problems businesses face when partnering with government 
entities. 
 
11. (U) Consultants with international PPP experience noted the 
importance of multilateral institutions in lowering perceived 
political risk as well as in providing payment guarantees. 
Brazil\'s unique situation made it difficult to apply \"lessons 
learned\" from other countries\' experiences with PPPs, but 
consultants advised that greater respect for contracts, more 
emphasis on negotiation, and building trust in the judiciary 
would help.  One emphasized that Brazil would be competing for 
investments and financing with other emerging markets and would 
need to publicize the program abroad.  The IADB Executive 
Director for Brazil said the organization stood ready to 
continue its support of infrastructure projects by offering the 
Brazilian private sector direct loans and guarantees to cover 
commercial and political risks involved in PPPs.  The IADB 
plans to extend US$ 300 million for PPPs in a line of credit 
through BNDES, Brazil\'s Development Bank. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12. (SBU) The seminar covered a lot of ground and left many 
wondering whether Brazil, with its history of unstable 
currency, inflation, mismanaged debt and business-damaging 
political shenanigans, is really ready and able to live up to 
its side of the bargain in PPPs.  PPPs have worked in developed 
countries with low political risk and respect for the rule of 
law.  One consultant told us that this would have been a pipe 
dream for Brazil in 1998, but conceded that with a few initial 
successes the model could well find its place in the Brazilian 
development model.  The GoB appears unshakable in the certainty 
that their legislation, said to be based on European models, 
provides the best possible framework for successful PPPs in 
Brazil.  While the 23 federal pilot projects for PPPs were 
selected late last year (highways, railways, port upgrades and 
irrigation projects), the delays in approving the bill will 
likely push off the initiation of any projects until early 
2005. 
 
13.  (U) Attendance at the seminar, held in Brasilia, surpassed 
expectations and demonstrated a desire to dig into the details 
of the subject among local banks, government and various 
service providers and civil construction firms.  The GoB\'s 
credibility will be on the line with the first PPP projects and 
will presumably give the latter kid-glove treatment to ensure 
initial success.  As many said at the seminar, the real test 
will come years down the road with new administrations, when 
Brazil\'s business maturity will be fairly judged with regard to 
PPPs -- praised or pilloried.

SUBJECT: \"Paralysis\" of GoB\'s Microeconomic Program 
 
 
1.  A column in the March 5-7 issue of top financial daily 
`Valor Economico\' summarized pessimists\' view that the Diniz 
scandal and other hurdles have resulted in a semi-breakdown 
of the legislative progress of the GoB\'s so-called 
`microeconomic\' reform measures, which are generally 
acknowledged as vital to sustain Brazil\'s future growth. 
Following is Embassy\'s unofficial and slightly edited 
translation of the column by `Valor\' commentator Claudia 
Safatle. 
 
3.  (Begin Text of Unofficial Embassy Translation) 
 
(HEADLINE) Paralysis is Conquering the Government 
 
The Waldomiro Diniz case is one problem.  But the 
government\'s real problem is a different one: economic 
growth.  This is the grave question to which the government 
needs to give quick answers, and for this it needs to break 
out of its paralysis.  It is not viable to conduct an 
economic policy that produces a retraction of 0.2% of the 
Gross Domestic Product, loss of real income, fall of per 
capita income, and spectacular growth (in the neighborhood 
of 140%) in profits of the banking system.  Something is 
wrong. 
 
From the start of the Diniz episode, from February 13 to the 
present, notwithstanding the political tangles which the 
government and PT got themselves into trying to manage the 
revelation of the corruption of Planalto\'s ex-advisor, the 
Presidency has held endless meetings of the government\'s 
power-nucleus, to try to emerge from paralysis and create a 
\"growth agenda.\" 
 
In formulating this initiative, the government has taken 
over from the hands of the bureaucracy, and is now parading, 
measures to stimulate civil construction, a sector that fell 
heavily last year (8.6%).  Now, the government is attempting 
to announce on an almost weekly basis measures of a more 
microeconomic nature to resolve problems that do indeed 
restrict investments, without which there will be no growth 
at all.  And to make these unveilings into events with 
maximum impact on public opinion.  Among the provisions 
already ripe to be announced is a new industrial policy for 
four already-defined sectors: software, pharmaceuticals, 
capital goods, and semi-conductors. 
 
The resumption of interest rates\' downward trajectory is a 
central part of the problem and here there is a conundrum to 
resolve: the Central Bank sees robust economic growth as 
having been underway since last October, with accompanying 
inflationary pressures.  The CB President, Henrique 
Meirelles, has said that the economy finished 2003 growing 
at a rate of 1.5% (in the last quarter) which, annualized, 
would represent an increase in GDP of 6.14% this year. 
Yesterday, in meetings with market representatives in Sao 
Paulo, directors of Central Bank reiterated this vision. 
\"People talk as if Brazil were not growing on a current 
basis because of the minus 0.2% from last year, and as if we 
will have to strain to grow 3.5% (in 2004).  That\'s not 
true.  It\'s nonsense.  Brazil is growing at an aggressive 
rate and even if we reduce this rate, we will reach 3.5% 
growth this year,\" commented Meirelles to `Valor\'. 
 
As the market sees it, in the first two months of 2004 the 
level of activity started to go cold and there are no 
menacing inflationary pressures on the horizon.  The great 
majority of banks and consultants are lowering their 
estimates of economic growth for this year.  Those who 
expected 4% are now closer to 3%, and there are those who 
project less than 3%... 
 
There has never been, during the existence of the inflation- 
target regime established in 1999, as profound a disconnect 
as now between the Central Bank and the market in their 
respective assessments of the economic situation... 
 
The difficulties in fostering the growth which in the 
Central Bank\'s view is going great guns but as far as the 
market is concerned is bogged-down and lacks new investment, 
don\'t stop, however, with the COPOM (Central Bank\'s Monetary 
Committee.)  It is just part of the problem and should not 
be held responsible for all the nation\'s ills. 
 
The other part, no less important, has to do with whether or 
not the country today has a favorable environment for 
investments.  The private sector says the environment is 
bad, and the government doesn\'t dispute this view.  It even 
has a list of things to do to improve things.  The challenge 
is to turn this generic list into concrete measures in a 
quick, effective way. 
 
The new energy model is an example.  It took months to 
construct a proposal, months to negotiate it, and it was 
approved by Congress just yesterday (March 4).  The basic 
rules for investments in sanitation and water-treatment 
circulate from hand to hand along Ministry Row.  After the 
government announces the preliminary bill for regulation of 
this sector, it will be presented for public audience and 
only after this process will it go to Congress. 
 
The role of the regulatory agencies was the focus of a 
concept document elaborated at the end of last year by the 
Civil Household (Casa Civil.).  Brought before a public 
forum, the document received more than 200 suggested 
amendments.  The government promised to transform the 
document into a bill that would define the exact role of 
regulatory agencies, but has not mentioned the subject 
since.  The sole bill sent to Congress on this subject had 
to do with the contracting of employees for Aneel and Anatel 
(electricity and telecomm regulatory agencies.) 
 
If it doesn\'t resume these initiatives, the government will 
end up hurting growth in future years, since this year\'s is 
a given...

Classified By: AMBASSADOR HRINAK. REASONS: 1.5 (b) (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary. On 19 March Ambassdor, accompanied by 
PolCouns, met with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary for 
Political Affairs Vera Pedrosa to deliver demarches 
requesting immediate contributions to the Hait MIF (ref B), 
and soliciting Brazil\'s support for USG plans and goals for 
building a democratic and prosperous Iraq (ref A). 
Ambassador also took the opportunity to discuss cooperation 
with Brazil in the UN Committee on Human Rights (refs C and 
D).  On Haiti, Pedrosa responded that operational and 
budgetary challenges, the need for congressional approval and 
GOB concerns about operations under a Chapter 7 mandate all 
make an immediate Brazilian deployment unlikely.  Longer 
term, the issue of a Chapter 7 v. Chapter 6 mandate for the 
follow-on stabilization force would need to be considered, 
but may be \"manageable\" so long as there continues to be 
strong GOB political will to participate, she said.  Pedrosa 
said Brazil has not offered, and is not encouraging a 
request, for provision in Brazil of asylum to Aristide. On 
Iraq, Brazil is considering reopening its embassy, but still 
evaluating the security environment. In the UNCHR, Pedrosa 
said she hoped the U.S. and Brazil will find issues for 
cooperation, but noted that Brazil\'s delegation has already 
been instructed to abstain on any Cuba resolution. Key points 
follow below. End summary. 
 
HAITI 
 
2. (C) In the absence of Foreign Minister Amorim (on his way 
to China) Ambassador provided Pedrosa with a Portuguese 
language paper containing ref B points, and explained there 
is an urgent need for additional forces now if the MIF is to 
secure and stabilize areas of the country beyond the capital. 
Ambassador also welcomed the arrival in Haiti on 19 March of 
a Brazilian military fact-finding mission, encouraged 
deployment of a Brazilian liaison officer to the U.S. 
Southern Command as soon as possible, and reiterated 
SOUTHCOM\'s willingness to try to provide as much operational 
support as possible for Brazil\'s deployment to Haiti, 
especially if that could facilitate a positive GOB response 
to ref B request. 
 
3. (C) Pedrosa responded that Brazil continues to plan for 
participation in a stabilization mission following the 90-day 
MIF period established by UNSCR 1529.  However, she expressed 
doubts that Brazil could move sooner in making an immediate 
deployment because (1) Brazil\'s congress must approve any 
deployment of forces, (2) the operational planning and 
budgetary issues confronting the GOB are challenging and will 
take time to work through.  She noted particularly that the 
GOB formula for reimbursing its soldiers for PKO missions is 
extremely expensive for the national government, hence 
extensive consultations are necessary with the planning 
ministry, as well as congress, before moving ahead with a 
large-scale deployment of forces. 
 
4. (C) PolCouns asked Pedrosa and MRE North America Division 
Chief Washington Pereira (also present in the meeting) 
whether the MIF\'s current mandate under Chapter 7 (as opposed 
to Chapter 6) would be a problem for an immediate Brazilian 
deployment now, and whether it would continue to be a problem 
if the UN maintains a Chapter 7 mandate in Haiti for the 
follow-on force.  Pedrosa said the GOB has traditionally 
interpreted Brazil\'s constitution as permitting Brazilian 
forces to participate only in Chapter 6 peace-keeping (as 
opposed to Chapter 7 peace-enforcement) missions.  Hence for 
both an immediate deployment and for participation in the 
follow-on mission, this would be a serious issue for the GOB 
(and potentially its congress) to deliberate.  However, 
Pedrosa and Washington Pereira did note that there is strong 
GOB interest in participating in Haiti, hence a Chapter 6-7 
dilemma, should one arise in the context of the follow-on 
deployment, may be \"manageable,\" so long as there continues 
to be GOB political will to support participation. 
 
5. (C) Ambassador asked whether Pedrosa could comment on some 
reports that Aristide may seek asylum in Brazil.  Pedrosa 
responded that Brazil had neither offered nor received a 
request in this regard, and she opined that the GOB would be 
unlikely to view the idea \"with enthusiasm\" should a request 
be made. 
 
IRAQ 
6. (SBU) Ambassador provided ref A paper, with a Portuguese 
summary, to Pedrosa, and indicated the USG is seeking general 
support for reftel plans and goals, as opposed to specific 
actions.  She noted that she understood Brazil is considering 
reopening its embassy in Iraq, and that there are many 
Brazilian companies with long experience and strong interest 
in Iraq. 
 
7. (SBU) Pedrosa indicated she would study ref A paper 
carefully, and confirmed that the GOB is considering 
reopening its mission in Iraq, but continues to study 
carefully the security situation on the ground. 
 
UNCHR Issues 
 
8. (C) Turning to UNCHR issues, Ambassador provided Pedrosa 
with papers containing a number of points on USG perspectives 
on CHR cooperation with GRULAC and on a range of other 
issues, noting the points had been provided by the Embassy in 
earlier demarches to the MRE human rights division, and that 
we looked forward to further reactions (refs C and D).  She 
also asked whether Pedrosa wished to outline some of the 
GOB\'s priorities for the UNCHR.  Pedrosa expressed the hope 
that the USG and GOB could work together on issues where 
their perspectives are similar, though some divergence would 
be inevitable. 
 
9. (C) On the issue of Cuba, Pedrosa indicated that the GOB 
delegation to the CHR had already been instructed to abstain 
on any single-country resolution, based on \"our customary 
reasons.\"  She said that a quiet dialogue on human rights 
with Castro is Brazil\'s preferred method to try to effect 
improvements. 
 
10. (C) Ambassador responded that, at a minimum, it would be 
helpful if the GOB could encourage Cuba to accept a UN 
special rapporteur mission, and she asked whether the GOB 
believed its quiet diplomacy is producing results.  Pedrosa 
said the decision to accept UN rapporteurs should be made by 
national governments for their own reasons, as Brazil had 
done.  Neither she nor Washington Pereira could offer 
examples of positive developments on human rights in Cuba, 
but Pedrosa noted that a new generation of Cubans -- both in 
Cuba and in Miami -- offer hope for a peaceful evolution on 
the island.

SUBJECT:  Latest GoB Testimony on FTAA to Brazilian Congress 
 
 
1.   SUMMARY.  On March 23, EconFSN attended a presentation 
to Brazil\'s Congress by Ambassador Macedo Soares, the MFA\'s 
Undersecretary for South American Affairs and top FTAA 
negotiator, on the current status of FTAA negotiations. 
Macedo Soares was speaking at the opening of the 
Parliamentary Committee of the Americas meeting, held at the 
Brazilian Chamber of Deputies and chaired by Deputy Maria 
Maninha (PT/DF).  Amb. Soares admitted the slow speed of 
current negotiations, but still voiced confidence that a 
Free Trade Area of the Americas will be agreed by January 1, 
2005 and, even if it starts up at a low `level of ambition\', 
will thereafter develop into a high-ambition project.  As 
best we can tell, Macedo Soares\' notion of this initial FTAA 
is limited in nature to market-access and tariff-reduction 
aspects.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Macedo Soares started his presentation by mentioning 
that Brazil is the only country in the hemisphere with wide 
press coverage on the FTAA issue.  He then drew attention to 
the contrast between the fast-approaching FTAA deadline and 
the lack of progress in negotiations.  He mentioned that the 
deadline of 2005 agreed at the 1994 Miami Summit had been 
reaffirmed during the Buenos Aires April 2001 Ministerial 
and at the Third Summit of the Americas at Quebec in 
November 2001 (NOTE:  there was no reference to the most 
recent reaffirmations of the 2005 deadline such as at the 
June 2003 presidential summit.  END NOTE).  He explained 
that the pressure on the negotiators increases as time slips 
by, especially on those from \"weaker\" countries. 
 
3.  Referring to what he termed the virtual recent 
immobilization of FTAA negotiations, Macedo Soares 
highlighted the following issues: 
 
-- market access:  The goal of Mercosul is to increase both 
agriculture and industrial exports to the U.S. and Canada, 
but it faces two major problems: agricultural subsidies and 
anti-dumping measures on manufactured products, such as 
steel.  Even if major tariff reductions occur, these two 
factors are still strong barriers to market access.  Amb. 
Soares reiterated that the U.S. has announced that these 
issues will not be treated at the FTAA level, as long as 
another \"strong trade power\", the E.U., does not lift its 
own such subsidies and barriers. 
 
-- Rules for Services/IPR/Government Procurement/Investment: 
Macedo Soares asserted to the Chamber that market access, 
with its tariff-reduction lists, should not be traded-for by 
means of concessions over rules on the above issues.  The 
GOB already has its established position for each item.  In 
general, Brazil will not go beyond its commitments made at 
the Uruguay Round, i.e., GATS for services, and TRIPS for 
IPR. 
 
-- Regarding investments, said Macedo Soares, Brazil is 
neither a member-party to plurilateral agreements, nor has 
it approved any Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs).  This, 
he commented, has not stopped some foreign companies from 
having been in the country for over a century.  Brazil is 
not in favor of any dispute-settlement arrangement regarding 
investments. 
 
-- On government procurement, in Macedo Soares\'s words, as 
there are no international rules on the issue, Brazil 
prefers to stick to its domestic legislation, keeping in 
mind that this is one of the few available instruments of 
industrial policy.  Macedo Soares commented that the U.S. 
also has restrictive GP policies. 
 
4.  Amb. Soares also made the following general observations 
on the FTAA negotiation process: 
 
-- the Mercosul countries will \"unlock\" negotiation groups 
so as to find a formula for the \"possible FTAA\", as defined 
by MFA Celso Amorim, or the \"FTAA which neither impedes nor 
imposes\", defined in the Miami Nov 2003 Ministerial. 
 
-- the idea is to find a \"common body\" of market access for 
all 34 countries, leaving greater ambitions for plurilateral 
agreements.  This would guarantee the successful conclusion 
of the negotiations. 
 
-- the current challenge is the definition of what should be 
negotiated in the common group both in order to reach a 
substantive result and also as preparation for the 
plurilaterals. 
 
--  The argument for \"emptying\" the content of the common 
body while intensifying the content of future plurilaterals 
is not in the interest of Brazilian businesses. 
 
--  A Brazilian attempt to exchange concessions in 
Services/Investments for benefits in agriculture might well 
not work;, thus, that is not a GOB negotiating stance. 
 
--  A common market in the Americas, including free transit 
of people, is desirable, but should be a long term goal, 
because targeting all issues in the short run would be 
dangerous, if not an illusion. 
 
5.  Further excerpts from Macedo Soares comments during the 
prolonged question-and-answer session: 
 
-- The Mercosul expectation is that in Puebla April 22-23, a 
set of parameters will be defined for the conclusion of FTAA 
negotiations by the end of 2004.  A Secretariat and a 
program of hemispheric cooperation should be developed to 
accompany FTAA implementation. 
 
--  Amb. Soares said that Cancun failed to make progress on 
the crucial agriculture question because its agenda was 
overloaded, but now prospects are much brighter, with 
promising proposals having been put forward by both the U.S. 
and E.U. trade authorities. 
 
-- it is not in Brazil\'s interest to concede to the U.S. the 
same benefits which would be conceded to neighbors. 
 
-- environment and labor issues may be considered, as long 
as they do not represent an obstacle to free trade and a 
means of sanctions based on a non-Brazilian judgment in the 
dispute-settlement mechanism.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL: EXPANDING TIES WITH CENTRAL AMERICA 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary. The directors of Brazil\'s foreign policy 
have traditionally placed Central America on their periphery. 
 Brazil has a history of peacekeeping in that region and runs 
a trade surplus, but the GoB has generally not expended a 
great deal of resources to expand its influence there.  As 
part of his hemispheric outreach, however, President Lula da 
Silva is attempting to improve Brazil\'s ties to the region, 
building on initiatives undertaken in the latter stages of 
the previous Cardoso administration.  End Summary. 
 
 View From Brasilia 
------------------- 
 
2. (SBU)  Julio Espirito Santo and Antonio Carlos Atunes of 
the Brazilian Foreign Ministry\'s Mexico, Central America, and 
Caribbean Division (DCC) told Poloff on March 23 that the 
Ministry places Central American countries outside of 
Brazil\'s normal \"sphere of influence\" because of Mexico\'s 
proximity and the long-standing U.S. role.  President Lula 
has certainly boosted Brasilia\'s focus on South American 
integration, but less so with the rest of Latin America, 
according to the two Brazilian diplomats.  Brazilian 
academics have argued that Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) has not 
cultivated close relations with many of the Central American 
leftist parties because of differing formative experiences 
and base constituencies. 
 
3. (SBU)  Brazil nonetheless has a history with Central 
America that provides a foundation for closer ties.  Brazil 
contributed limited numbers of peacekeepers, monitors, and 
demining experts in the aftermath of Central America\'s sundry 
Cold War insurgencies.  Brazil participated in the UN 
Inspection Mission in Guatemala (MINGUA) and provided 
training to public security forces in the region.  In 
addition, Brasilia donated significant quantities of 
assistance and forgave El Salvador\'s debt after Hurricane 
Mitch, the DCC officials pointed out.  Besides working with 
the Central American countries in OAS fora, Brazil has 
interacted with these nations in the Rio Group setting, where 
Central American countries comprise almost a third of the 
membership, Espirito Santo said. 
 
Getting Past the G-20 
--------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso became 
the first Brazilian head of state to travel to the isthmus 
when he attended a trade conference in San Jose in 2000. 
That conference sought to increase ties between Mercosul and 
the Central American Free Trade Area (CAFTA).  Brazil\'s trade 
with the region is relatively small, but it involves a 
significant trade surplus with all the countries.  For 
example, Brazil\'s exports to Honduras in 2000 were valued at 
more than 31 million dollars, while it imported less than 
700,000 dollars worth of Honduran products. 
 
5. (SBU)  The seminal event for Brazil\'s future relations 
with the isthmus was the formation of the G-20 for the WTO 
Cancun meeting, Espirito Santo noted.  He told Poloff that El 
Salvador, Guatemala, and Costa Rica were charter members 
along with Brazil of the G-20, but Washington\'s \"natural 
leverage\" soon spliced off the Central Americans.  The DCC 
officials underscored that Brazil has not written off Central 
America as a potential partner in trade negotiations after 
the G-20 experience, but will likely focus on the formal 
multilateral (Mercosul-CAFTA) exchanges.  Brazil will also 
continue to work with individual countries, as occurred with 
Honduras on coffee pricing issues, the MFA officials added. 
 
 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
6. (SBU)  Atunes concurred with press reports that Panama is 
likely to be of the greatest interest to Brazilian investors 
and business in the foreseeable future.  Brazilian/Panamanian 
trade reportedly increased 43 percent from 2002 to 2003 and 
Brazilian construction companies are anxious to participate 
in Canal maintenance contracts.  Espirito Santo noted that 
Brazil has yet to actively engage the Central American 
countries on the GoB\'s bid for a permanent seat on the UNSC, 
but that Brazil\'s past peacekeeping-related activities in the 
region and planned PKO contribution in Haiti will be used as 
selling points.  While Brazil\'s approach to foreign policy 
makes Costa Rica its most natural partner in multilateral 
fora, the DCC officials assessed that President Lula appears 
to be developing a good relationship with conservative 
Guatemalan President Oscar Berger.

REF: SECSTATE 62180 
 
According to the Ministry of Development, Industry and 
Foreign Trade, Department of Foreign Trade Operations 
(DECEX), Brazil maintains no controls on exports of steel or 
copper scrap.  The only requirement for scrap exports that 
differs in any way from the norm, according to the 
Department, is a requirement that proof of the purchase price 
of the scrap be provided at the time of export.  This 
requirement was established for tax purposes, given the 
difficulty of establishing the commercial value of some scrap 
items.  A cross-check with Brazil\'s published, consolidated 
list of items subject to export controls or requiring special 
procedures showed no controls on scrap, coke, DRI, copper 
cathode or iron ore exports.  To the contrary, Brazil is a 
major exporter of the latter.

1.  (C)  Summary and Introduction:  As a result of Article 98 
sanctions, Brazil\'s MOD is shifting to other countries for 
training and exchanges previously done with the U.S. -- a 
drop-off clearly evident to this Mission. Many in the 
Brazilian military -- including Defense Minister Viegas 
himself -- consider this development unfortunate and want to 
reinvigorate bilateral mil-mil ties, particularly leading up 
to Brazil\'s upcoming peacekeeping effort in Haiti.  Indeed, 
Defense Minister Viegas recently told the Ambassador that he 
views Brazil\'s participation in Haiti as an opportunity to 
try to bolster the Brazil-U.S. military relationship (Ref A). 
 But the transfer of funds to pay course/exchange costs and 
particularly full FMS pricing is unacceptable for Brazil. 
Unfortunately, a reversal of the decline in training and 
exchanges with the U.S. is unlikely; Brazil remains opposed 
to signing an Article 98 accord.  End Summary 
 
2.  (C) Prior to the imposition of Article 98 sanctions on 
July 1, 2003, the Brazilian Ministry of Defense (MOD) 
leadership warned that it would seek military training and 
exchange opportunities elsewhere if this were done and Brazil 
was subject to paying full FMS course costs for military 
training.  Almost nine months later, the MOD has indeed 
shifted most of its training away from U.S. military 
institutions.  Brazilian military leaders assert that MOD has 
done so without reducing the overall level of overseas 
training opportunities available to its officers. 
 
3.  (C) As expected, other countries have offered MOD 
training programs to replace those previously conducted at 
U.S. institutions. While France and the United Kingdom have 
picked up much of the slack, Brazilian officers, according to 
military sources, are now being sent also to training 
programs in China, India, and South Africa. 
 
4.  (C) A brief survey reveals that a severe drop off in U.S. 
training and exchanges has already occurred. The Navy plans 
to send only three officers to the U.S. in 2005, including 
two pilots for two-year flight training that MOD \"would have 
paid for anyway\" according to Navy sources.  When a decision 
on purchase of Brazil\'s next generation fighter jet, the F-X, 
is finally taken, training for pilots will likely be in the 
country of origin of the new aircraft; this further 
prejudices the already limited prospects for the U.S. F-X 
competitor, Lockheed Martin\'s F-16. The Army has also sliced 
the number of officers being sent to U.S. schools for 
training and exchanges.  The Army command\'s 2004 list of 
visits and other activities in the U.S. shows only one 
program as long as one month -- a program carried on the Army 
list as \"no cost.\" 
 
5.  (C) Brazilian Army staff officers are emphatic that they 
continue to want strong ties with the U.S., and senior 
officers appear ready to switch back to the U.S. if full IMET 
funding were restored in the future.  Some senior Brazilian 
military officers go further and believe Brazil should bear 
the full costs for friendly nation military exchanges in 
Brazil.  Thus, they argue, reciprocal treatment should be 
granted Brazilian officers attending such exchange courses 
elsewhere.  Some of Brazil\'s new mil-mil exchanges are based 
on this formula. 
 
6.  (C) Comment:  Given the military\'s wounded pride and the 
now high costs of training in the United States, it is 
doubtful the sharp decline in training and exchanges with the 
U.S. will be reversed anytime soon.  Despite the loss of 
valued U.S. training and exchanges, neither the MOD nor the 
GOB shows any sign of softening its opposition in principle 
to signing an Article 98 Agreement with us.  As U.S.-Brazil 
training links weaken, so too, inevitably, will the 
traditionally close ties between our two armed forces.

1.  (C) Summary: According to the head of the Brazilian 
Foreign Ministry\'s Human Rights Division, Brazil will abstain 
on any Cuba or China resolutions and on a Chinese \"no-action\" 
motion.  (Note: Ambassador will raise the Cuba and China 
resolutions at a more senior level again March 29.  End 
note.)  Brazil may support a resolution on Turkmenistan. 
Brazil will support resolutions on North Korea, and will wait 
to study the proposed text on Iran before deciding.  The GOB 
condemns the Israeli execution of Hamas\' leader and considers 
it an obstacle to peace.  Brazil is more supportive than the 
USG of several proposed resolutions regarding economic, 
social, and cultural rights and the links between 
development, democracy, and human rights.  The GOB will wait 
to see the proposed texts for Iraq and Zimbabwe before 
deciding.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) On March 24, Poloff met with Andre Saboia, head of 
the Foreign Ministry\'s (MRE) Human Rights Division, to 
deliver ref A talking points, on the Cuba and China 
resolutions (The GOB will abstain in both cases.  See 
paragraphs 3 and 4.), and to discuss USG and GOB priorities 
and cooperation with the GRULAC during the 60th session of 
the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (CHR) (refs B 
and C).  Poloff emphasized to Saboia the USG\'s interest in 
cooperating with GRULAC countries during this session of the 
CHR. 
 
(Note: Ambassador will again raise the Cuba and China 
resolutions March 29 with MRE Assistant Secretary for 
International Organization Affairs.  Ambassador raised the 
points previously with Under Secretary for Political Affairs 
Vera Pedrosa on March 19 and was told Brazil would abstain 
(ref D).  On March 12 Poloff had provided the MRE\'s Assistant 
Secretary for Human and Social Themes Department with talking 
 
SIPDIS 
points about USG CHR priorities and cooperation with the 
GRULAC drawn from refs B and C (ref E).  In addition, on 
March 26, Poloff provided the MRE\'s UN Division with copies 
of the CHR talking points and provided that office and the 
Human Rights Division the revised text on the China 
resolution (ref F).  End note. 
 
Brazil Says It Will Abstain on Cuba and China 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Saboia reiterated that GOB policy is not to support 
country-specific resolutions, with few exceptions.  Saboia 
said Brazil will maintain its traditional position of 
abstention on any Cuba resolution.  While recognizing human 
rights problems in Cuba, the GOB prefers to maintain a 
bilateral dialogue with Castro\'s regime, he said.  He argued 
that President Lula\'s good relationship with Castro places 
the GOB in a position to have a quiet, but positive impact on 
the human rights situation in Cuba. 
 
4.  (C) While conceding that the GOB\'s bilateral dialogue on 
human rights with China \"is not very profound,\" Saboia said 
it is unlikely the GOB will support a resolution condemning 
the human rights situation in China.  Moreover, Brazil will 
likely abstain on a no-action motion, as it has traditionally 
done in the past.  (Comment: Given that Brazilian Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim recently visited China and floated the 
idea of a free trade agreement, in addition to other trade 
initiatives, the probability of the GOB changing its 
traditional position of abstention seems low.  End comment.) 
 
Turkmenistan 
------------- 
 
5.  (C) Saboia noted that during Third Committee meetings in 
the UN General Assembly (UNGA) the resolution condemning 
human rights violations in Turkmenistan had passed with wide 
support, though not Brazil\'s.  As a result, the GOB is 
considering supporting a resolution in the CHR, he said. 
According to him, the GOB has received useful information 
about the deterioration of the human rights situation in 
Turkmenistan from Great Britain and is now studying the 
matter.  While not willing to provide an official response, 
Saboia said the GOB will likely support a \"balanced\" 
resolution. 
 
Israel 
------ 
 
6.  (C) Saboia pointed out to poloff that the assassination 
of the head of Hamas was condemned by the GOB and said it, 
\"complicates an already fragile situation and makes it very 
difficult for the peace process to move forward.\"  While 
saying the GOB will wait to see any text regarding the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he made it clear that Brazil 
believes Israeli government\'s policies of targeted 
assassinations, in addition to the ongoing construction of 
the Israeli defense barrier, are the primary obstacles to the 
peace process. 
 
North Korea and Iran 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Saboia said Brazil will support a resolution on North 
Korea.  The GOB has received \"good information on the 
situation in North Korea from China,\" according to him. 
There is a possibility Brazil might support an Iran 
resolution, but the GOB will wait to see a text on Iran 
before making a determination.  Saboia stressed that Brazil\'s 
support for an Iran resolution -- in the Third Committee 
during the UNGA last year -- should not be interpreted as 
meaning Brazil will automatically support one during the CHR. 
 
 
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and Democracy 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
8.  (C) Concerning economic, social, and cultural rights, 
Saboia said the GOB believes them to be as important as 
political and civil rights.  Therefore, the USG and the GOB 
may not be in complete agreement on some resolutions in this 
area.  Brazil will likely support the resolutions \"Promotion 
of a Democratic and Equitable International Order\" and 
\"Strengthening of Popular Participation,\" he said.  Saboia 
was unable to respond to questions about the GOB\'s position 
on resolutions for Iraq and Zimbabwe, Romania\'s resolution on 
the Consolidation of Democracy, and Australia\'s resolution on 
Human Rights and Good Governance. 
 
9.  (C) Comment: Brazil\'s likely support for the Turkmenistan 
and North Korea country resolutions is considered exceptional 
by the MRE, the result of a broad consensus in the CHR, and 
what the GOB considers to be good, credible information it 
has received from Great Britain and China respectively. 
These exceptions demonstrate that the GOB can be swayed from 
its traditional position of non-support for country-specific 
resolutions, when a broad consensus among other CHR countries 
can be reached.  End comment.

1. (C) SUMMARY.  The Lula administration has fumbled its 
response to February\'s \"Waldomiro scandal\", resulting in 
non-stop criticism from the Brazilian press and opposition. 
Worse for the administration, many of the parties in the 
governing coalition have responded to the crisis not by 
rallying behind the government, but by ratcheting up their 
complaints about GoB economic policies and their demands for 
special favors.  The PL, PMDB, PTB, and PP have been 
particuarly contentious allies.  As a result, the coalition 
is frayed and Lula\'s ability to push legislation to 
reestablish his momentum will be constrained unless he can 
rebuild the coalition\'s unity --a difficult task given that 
this is an election year in which the parties have individual 
agendas and added incentive to squabble.  The first step in 
the process occurred on March 30, when Lula promised to 
disburse some R$500 million to fund legislators\' pet projects 
in return for their support on a key congressional vote.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
GOVERNING COALITION SHOWS FRAYED EDGES 
-------------------------------------- 
2. (C) The Waldomiro Diniz scandal (in which a senior advisor 
on President Lula\'s staff was caught on videotape soliciting 
bribes from a numbers racketeer) broke on February 13.  Since 
then, the administration has careened from perplexity to 
difficulty, as Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu\'s reputation has 
plummeted, the GoB\'s approval numbers have slipped (ref A), 
and the parties in the ruling coalition have begun to sound 
more like opposition critics than Lula supporters.  Of note, 
a national poll released on March 25 reveals that 52% of 
respondents had never even heard of the Waldomiro scandal, 
and only 9% said it changed their opinion of the government. 
Thus, it is the perception of ineffectiveness (coupled with 
Brazil\'s stubborn economic problems), rather than the scandal 
itself, that has contributed to the government\'s slump. 
 
3. (C) Physiologism (\"fisiologismo\") is a Brazilian term 
roughly translatable as \"crass opportunism\", applied to 
politicians with no core beliefs who switch allegiances for 
short-term advantage.  The administration\'s problems have 
been amplified by the fact that some coalition members are 
hardly true-believers in the vision of Lula and the Workers\' 
Party (PT).  They joined the coalition to be on the side of 
power, and they will threaten to leave just as quickly if 
they sense the coalition losing authority.  This is 
particularly true since nationwide municipal elections will 
be held in October, meaning the parties are jockeying against 
each other to win mayorships and city council seats. 
 
LIBERAL PARTY TURNS MEAN 
------------------------ 
4. (C) Waldemar Costa Neto, President of the Liberal Party 
(PL), gave a stinging March 14 press interview in which he 
said, \"The greatest problem is that nobody at the core of the 
government understands economics\".  He said that both Finance 
Minister Palocci and Central Bank President Meirelles should 
be fired and economic policy turned over to Vice President 
Jose Alencar (of the PL).  When Lula expressed his 
displeasure with Costa Neto\'s comments, other party leaders 
walked them back.  The PL is a right-of-center party that 
Lula wooed into the coalition to increase his appeal to both 
the business and evangelical communities.  Costa Neto is not 
the only unhappy Liberal.  When the scandal broke in 
February, PL Senator Magno Malta vainly tried to set up a 
congressional inquiry (ref B) that would have dragged out the 
scandal for months.  Meanwhile, VP Alencar has periodically 
(most recently on March 29) criticized the administration\'s 
fiscal austerity policies. 
 
PMDB JOINS THE FRAY 
------------------- 
5. (C) The PL is not the coalition\'s only headache.  The 
chronically-divided PMDB abruptly changed course at a party 
leadership meeting on March 14, dealing a defeat to the 
pro-Lula wing led by Senator Jose Sarney.  It was Sarney\'s 
parliamentary tactic that saved the GoB further angst by 
killing Magno Malta\'s attempt to set up a scandal inquiry in 
the Senate.  Lula was grateful, but the move left Sarney 
exposed within his own party.  At the March 14 meeting, Sao 
Paulo Federal Deputy Michel Temer, a Lula critic, was 
reelected PMDB president with the support of the first couple 
of Rio de Janeiro: Governor Rosinha and Anthony Garotinho. 
Even with Temer\'s resurgence, the PMDB is too \"physiologist\" 
to leave the coalition on principle, for that would mean 
giving up its cabinet posts and other perks (though some PMDB 
Deputies released a letter on March 24 threatening to pull 
out of the coalition if their economic advice were not 
followed).  Instead, the party will increase its criticism of 
the administration and demand more perks (and influence over 
policy) in return for its tepid support. 
 
6. (C) Sarney\'s influence within the PMDB will be reduced, at 
least until he figures out a way to fight back.  Anthony 
Garotinho is already positioning himself to run in the 2006 
presidential elections, often slamming the administration in 
public statements.  Garotinho appears to have forgotten that 
the PMDB is in the ruling coalition, noting on March 27, \"We 
are not radicals.  We\'re building a \'constructive 
opposition\'.  This is not targeting the President, but is 
designed to help him.  Even though the government mistreats 
us, we feel no rancor.\"  If the anti-Lula faction retains 
control over the party through 2005, it might then leave the 
coalition to open more daylight for Garotinho\'s presidential 
run.  In the meantime, the PMDB will be looking to negotiate 
with the PT on candidate slates in key towns for October\'s 
municipal elections. 
 
LULA GETS NO JOY FROM OWN PARTY 
------------------------------- 
7. (C) On March 5, without consulting Lula, the Workers\' 
Party (PT) Executive Committee issued a statement critical of 
the administration\'s economic policies.  Lula complained to 
party President Jose Genoino, who quickly walked back the 
statement.  But two weeks later, PT \"radicals\" (the leftist 
wings of the party) met in Sao Paulo and also demanded 
economic policy changes.  While these episodes did not cause 
serious damage, they underscore two phenomena:  a) the 
ideological differences that fester within the PT (and the 
constant work Lula must do to keep his own troops in line); 
and b) that many in the PT are politically tone-deaf.  The 
March 5 statement was issued during a particularly tough week 
(Magno Malta\'s attempt to set up a scandal inquiry in the 
Senate was a huge concern for the administration at the 
time).  The fact that PT leaders would publicly criticize 
Lula when he most needed their unified support illustrates 
the impulse by some members to behave as an opposition party 
--even a year after Lula\'s inauguration-- when they should 
have developed better governing skills. 
 
SMALLER PARTIES ALL OVER THE BOARD 
---------------------------------- 
8. (C) The smaller parties in the coalition have also spoken 
out, both for and against the administration.  The 
conservative PP and populist PTB have threatened to pull out 
of the coalition, though both are highly \"physiologist\" and 
their threats are not taken seriously, except as they are 
designed to attract administration attention to their demands 
for pork barrel spending and second- and third-tier 
government job appointments.  The week of March 22, the two 
parties led a mini-rebellion that delayed voting on Lula\'s 
Presidential Decree to ban bingo parlors (refs B, C). 
Meanwhile, the left-of-center Popular Socialist Party (PPS) 
--always a loyal, low-maintenance coalition member-- on March 
28 reelected as party president Federal Deputy  Roberto 
Freire who promptly announced that the PPS will continue to 
support Lula and \"does not want to take advantage of the 
political crisis\".  The socialist PSB has similarly been 
quietly supportive of the administration. 
 
COMMENT - WINNING OVER THE ALLIES 
--------------------------------- 
9. (C) The government\'s doldrums have been nourished not only 
by an undisciplined coalition, but also its own poor response 
to the Waldomiro scandal (exacerbated by the fact that Chief 
of Staff Jose Dirceu, the administration\'s best tactician, 
was at the center of the storm and not in a position to 
provide good advice.  Septel will examine Dirceu\'s role in 
the crisis and the government.)  The administration is now 
appealing to coalition leaders\' desire to hang together 
rather than hang separately, but it is not doing so 
empty-handed.  Lula\'s new cabinet-rank Political Coordinator, 
Aldo Rebelo, is putting together a \"political council\" 
comprising leaders from all nine allied parties, and a 
coalition \"code of conduct\" is under discussion.  Rebelo is 
also pledging to speed the nomination of precious federal job 
appointments (the tens of thousands of positions throughout 
the GoB\'s nationwide apparatus have always been among the 
sweetest of political plums).  In terms of legislation, the 
administration has put on the back-burner plans for campaign 
finance reform and a bill that would have allowed the Senate 
and Chamber presidents to serve for four, rather than two, 
years.  Both bills had stirred opposition inside the 
coalition. 
 
10. (C) One legislative achievement, freighted with 
symbolism, occurred at midnight on March 30, when the Chamber 
of Deputies voted to ratify Lula\'s February 20 Presidential 
Decree that banned bingo and slot parlors throughout the 
country.  That decree was Lula\'s first and strongest response 
to the Waldomiro scandal, but to remain in force it needed a 
congressional vote --a vote which, if Lula had lost, would 
have been a clear rebellion by the coalition and a heavy blow 
to his legislative authority.  The PP and PTB parties managed 
to put off the Chamber vote for a week (para 8).  In the 
hours before the vote, the administration managed to buy 
coalition unity by promising to disburse a R$300 million 
package of pork barrel spending already approved by Congress 
in this year\'s budget (as well as releasing another R$200 
million undisbursed from last year).  The bingo ban now goes 
to the Senate for a final vote.  A further R$1.2 billion 
remains undisbursed and presumably available to buy more 
legislative victories as the end of Congress\'s session 
approaches on June 30.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL: FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF MILITARY COUP 
 
REF: BUENOS AIRES 961 
 
1.  (SBU) Introduction and Summary.  Unlike the 
civil-military contretemps surrounding the 28th anniversary 
of Argentina\'s military coup (reftel), Brazil has marked the 
40th anniversary (March 31) of its coup in a more circumspect 
fashion.  The monumental transition to full democracy during 
the last two decades seems almost taken for granted in much 
of the coverage, as the Brazilian media has focused on 
unresolved human rights cases, rehashed the conditions that 
led to the military action, and opined on other long-term 
effects of the military\'s nineteen-year regime.  While 
steadily receding, the military regime era still casts some 
shadows on Brazil-U.S. relations. End introduction and 
summary 
 
Forty Years Ago 
---------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  Mainstream Brazilian news outlets have detailed 
the circumstances and legacy of the 1964 military coup that 
ousted President Goulart and ushered in two decades of 
\"General-Presidents.\"  While bemoaning the military\'s human 
and civil rights violations, misguided pharaonic projects in 
the Amazon, and ultimately failed economic policies, some 
pundits credit the military presidents for modernizing 
Brazil, and occasionally standing up to the United States. 
This \"on the other hand\" praise recalls comments by 
then-candidate Lula da Silva in 2002, who credited the same 
military government that jailed him with pursuing strategic 
planning that benefited the country.  Other legacies of that 
era have received less media attention.  These include the 
unwieldy, novel-sized 1988 Constitution -- an over-reaction 
to the dictatorship that hobbled effective governance by 
minutely detailing a vast range of states\' and citizens\' 
rights -- and the inordinate influence of the regime-endorsed 
opposition party, the PMDB, which evolved into a patronage 
machine that still frustrates presidents today. 
 
The Military Today 
----------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  Not surprisingly, the Brazilian military is 
perhaps the single Brazilian institution most changed since 
the dictatorship era.  The military\'s experience in 
governance was in large measure controversial and 
frustrating, and today\'s soldiers want no part in politics. 
The Brazilian armed forces are now securely under civilian 
authority, and willingly play a diminished role in national 
decisionmaking.  Although Brazil\'s constitution gives the 
military an internal order role in crises, officers no longer 
see themselves as the nation\'s bulwark against incompetent 
politicians.  Instead, they are keenly focused on 
professionalism, seeking to protect national borders, prepare 
for peacekeeping missions and provide assistance to remote 
populations. The change is widely perceived and public 
opinion polls consistently show the military among the 
country\'s most trusted institutions, even though its funding 
has plummeted through the years. 
 
4. (SBU) There remains some negative residue. There is a 
feeling among some older and retired officers that the steps 
the military took to move the country back toward democracy 
are not appreciated today.  And there remains a subtle degree 
of rancor toward the USG, owing to a sense among some older 
officers that the U.S. switched abruptly from supporting the 
military government to condemning it for human rights 
violations.  In addition, the Brazilian military\'s reluctance 
to take on some counterdrug and crime control missions which 
could involve violent engagement with civilians is reinforced 
by lingering questions about unresolved 1970s 
counterinsurgency-related disappearances. 
 
Economic Legacy 
--------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) The most trumpeted positive aspect of the 
dictatorship was its supposed \"economic miracle,\" commonly 
attributed to the direction of state industrial development 
by skilled teams of non-ideological technocrats.  Brazil\'s 
GDP growth was said to be the world\'s highest from the late 
1960s until halted by the world oil crisis in the 1970s.  The 
dictatorship completed monster energy and infrastructure 
projects.  The generals also nurtured and protected (with 
rigid market reserves) some key heavy industries (e.g. 
automobiles) and \"strategic\" production, most notably 
informatics.  (Ironically, it was in part the emphasis on 
protected heavy industries that made the labor movement\'s 
strikes in the 1970s such effective platforms for the growing 
democratic opposition.) 
 
6. (SBU)  At the same time, it eventually became recognized 
that the \"miracle\" did little to lessen Brazil\'s historic 
curse of poverty and income disparities -- wealth accrued 
mostly to the elite and a slowly broadening middle class in 
the south and also brought benefits to industrial workers, 
but the country\'s poor grew poorer.  Even the statistics upon 
which the regime based its claims of overall growth 
transpired toward the end to be debatable.  In the context of 
official economic policies and attitudes, Brazil\'s 
dictatorship left few discernible marks.  Everyone in both 
public and the private sectors here acknowledges that the 
state can never again dispose of the resources to launch a 
broad-based development design. 
 
Some Lingering Repercussions for U.S. Interests 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (SBU)  Some journalists and academics portray the U.S. as 
directly encouraging the coup plotters, or at least having 
foreknowledge of the planning.  Some of the more 
sensationalist publications draw labored parallels between 
1964 and the level of U.S. influence in Brazil today.  But 
other Brazilian reporters note that the USG has provided 
greater access to documents and tape recordings of official 
conversations from that era than are available in Brazilian 
archives, and \"O Estado de Sao Paulo\'s\" 31 March edition 
featured an essay by former U.S. Ambassador Lincoln Gordon 
(1961-65)  debunking accusations of USG collusion with the 
coup makers.  Most informed observers have concluded that the 
Brazilian civilian political leadership of that era bears a 
significant measure of responsibility, and that the generals 
and admirals who mounted the coup were prepared to move 
regardless of U.S. signals. 
 
8. (SBU) Weekly newsmagazine VEJA has pointed out that an 
important legacy of the military regime is the state of 
Brazil\'s nuclear program.  The dictatorship\'s failed attempts 
to fabricate a nuclear weapon and its cooperation with Iraq 
and others still color Brazilian policy decisions.  The 
militarization of that program contributed to Brazil\'s not 
signing the NPT until 1998 and for a time slowed Brazil\'s 
evolution into a regional non-proliferation success story. 
 
9.  (SBU)  The coup also indirectly built up the prestige 
Fidel Castro still holds among Brazil\'s left.  Goulart\'s 
flirtation with Castro and Che had rankled the Brazilian 
military even before the coup.  Castro\'s support for the 
failed Brazilian insurgents of the early 1970s and opposition 
political and union movements still endear him to key members 
of the current government, some of whom sought refuge in Cuba 
during the military era, including Presidential Chief of 
Staff Jose Dirceu. 
 
Water Under the Bridge 
---------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) Comment. Two of Brasilia\'s three bridges are named 
after military presidents.  The third and newest commemorates 
a popular civilian president who lost his political rights 
under the military regime and whose death some blame on the 
dictatorship. Brazil\'s culture, economy, and political life 
still contain many such ironies (e.g., Brazil\'s 
privately-owned aviation giant EMBRAER began as a parastatal

Minister Amorim and his left-leaning Deputy Minister worked 
for a film parastatal during the dictatorship.).  The harsher 
aspects of the dictatorship and the long return to democracy 
are not forgotten.  However, 40 years since the coup and 19 
years since the return to civilian rule, the military era is 
of less and less relevance to a forward-looking society in 
which a third of the population was born after the 
restoration of democracy.  Brazil\'s civil and political 
institutions are now fully democratic, the military is a 
respected (if underfunded) professional force, and some of 
the opposition figures of the military era are now running 
the country.

1.  (C) Summary: After weeks of intensifying criticism of the Lula administration\'s stringent fiscal line from within and without the government (Ref A), Finance Minister Palocci received unexpectedly cordial treatment during a marathon 
seven hours of testimony to the Senate Economic Affairs Committee March 30.  The hearing featured the unscheduled visit of Senate President Jose Sarney and Chamber of Deputies President Joao Paulo Cunha, who dropped by to publicly affirm their support for Palocci.  The show of coalition unity on economic policy helped reassure the markets: the Real appreciated, Sao Paulo\'s stock exchange was up and spreads on Brazilian eurobonds narrowed.  Lula himself continues to publicly defend both Palocci and the GoB,s current economic policy line.  While we have no doubt of continued GoB policy steadfastness, failure to deliver near-term growth may make it politically ever more difficult to get legislative approval of the structural economic reforms necessary for medium and long term growth.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) GoB economic policy, in particular its strict 
adherence to the fiscal goal of a 4.25% of GDP primary 
surplus and the Central Bank,s ultra-cautious stance on 
inflationary pressures, have come under ever broader 
sustained criticism for the last several weeks (Refs A and 
B).   Even Vice-President Alencar has periodically joined the bandwagon, recently labeling the GoB,s fiscal policy 
\"irresponsible.\"  Palocci nevertheless reaffirmed the GoB,s 
unwavering commitment to the primary-surplus goal in March 30 Senate hearings, saying that this pillar of economic policy would be maintained for years to come and is the best way to create an environment that ultimately allows sustained lower interest rates.  Palocci\'s appearance garnered backing from the opposition PSDB party, but given the infighting within Lula\'s coalition over economic policy (ref C), there likely was more political import to the public affirmation of support from the PMDB\'s Sarney (whose party is part of the governing coalition) and from the PT\'s Cunha. 
 
3.  (U) The March 30 show of unity in the governing coalition reassured markets, with the Real appreciating against the dollar, the Sao Paulo stock exchange (BOVESPA) gaining 2.38% and spreads on Brazilian eurobonds above U.S. treasuries falling 3.3%.  Despite this market uptick, popular perceptions have actually been worsening: recent polling data shows the percentage of Brazilians who expect no economic growth in 2004 was up over 11 percentage points to 34.2%. 
 
4. (C) The GoB, by contrast, has not shaved its official 
growth projections, although its view of what sectors will 
lead GDP growth has changed.  Planning Ministry chief 
economic advisor Miranda told Econoff March 24 that exports 
and investment will lead growth this year, which he still 
expects to come in about 3.5%.  Previous predictions had been that pent-up consumer demand would spark consumption growth as interest rates came down, thus spurring new investment.  While not disputing Miranda\'s take, newly arrived IMF resident representative Alier (please protect) told us March 30 that he believes the biggest danger to GDP growth this year is a \"wait and see\" attitude among investors and large companies.  He agreed that unexpectedly low foreign borrowings by Brazilian companies in February and early March, after record January levels, were consistent with this \"wait and see\" diagnosis. 
 
5. (SBU) The market turbulence that Brazilian investors are 
waiting out began after the Central Bank unexpectedly 
interrupted its cycle of interest rate cuts in January, 
citing inflationary pressures (Ref B).  In this context, the March Central Bank decision to cut the baseline SELIC 
interest rate was notable not for its modest 
quarter-percentage-point size, but for the statement in the 
minutes of Central Bank\'s meeting, released March 25, that 
the Bank sees inflationary pressures easing.  The first 
quarter inflation report, released March 31, reinforces the 
data on the easing of inflationary pressures and predicts 
consumer price inflation of 5.2% for the year, below the 
Central Bank\'s 5.5% target.  Other hints of an improving 
economy may buy the GoB room for maneuver.  Unemployment, for example, edged slightly lower in the latest national figures, while credit grew (8.2% on loans to private individuals and 12.5% to companies).  Foreign borrowings by companies began to recover at the end of March as well.  Many data points on current economic growth, however, have been either inconclusive or negative. 
 
6. (C) Comment.  The public closing of coalition ranks behind Palocci at his March 30 committee hearings has provided some welcome reassurance of the prospects for GoB policy steadfastness -- which we do not believe should have been in doubt.  The political sniping of recent weeks, however, has forced Lula to identify himself publicly in a very personal way with stringent fiscal and monetary policies that remain highly unpopular. 
He also has had to use political capital 
to keep coalition partners in line, at a time when his 
government\'s popularity has slipped  (ref C).  If first- and second-quarter results fail to show positive developments with regard to GDP growth and new jobs, Lula will be forced to spend ever more time defending policies popularly perceived to be failing.  The same political dynamic risks further hampering the GoB\'s legislative momentum for the structural and microeconomic reforms required for longer-term growth.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S STATE OF GOIAS:  RIDING THE AGRICULTURAL 
BOOM 
 
 
This cable is Sensitive but Unclassified, please protect 
accordingly. 
 
1. (U) Summary.  The central Brazilian state of Goias, from 
which the Federal District of Brasilia was carved 47 years 
ago, has grown above the average for Brazil over the last 
several years.  The state\'s economy, fueled primarily by 
agriculture and an emerging agribusiness, has a growing 
awareness of the importance of exports.  Business reps 
welcomed the market opening that FTAA would represent, but 
were wary of U.S. competition and of perceived U.S. 
protectionism, particularly of agricultural products. 
Beyond agriculture, the state is searching for a new 
strategy to attract out-of-state businesses, since tax 
exemptions are supposed to be phased out shortly under 
national level tax reform.  While the state is heavily in 
debt to the federal government, above-average revenue growth 
has cushioned the burden of debt service.  In conversations 
with Econoff, even working-class Lula voters lauded second- 
term governor Marconi Perillo, from the centrist PSDB party. 
Perillo\'s youth and popularity give him potential for a 
future political role on the national level.  Lula\'s 
trademark Zero Hunger (\"Fome Zero\") program has no resonance 
here, as effective state-level programs seem to be 
adequately addressing such social needs.  Despite 
discomfiture by some over squatter land invasions by 
landless activists (MST), the most commonly cited social 
issue was the need to deal with immigrants from other parts 
of Brazil to this island of relative prosperity.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) Econoff traveled March 16-17 to Goiania (population 
1.2 million), the seventy-year-old capital of the Brazilian 
state of Goias, an agricultural state in central Brazil. 
Goias, while one of the larger Brazilian states in land 
area, has a population of only 5.3 million, much of it 
rural.  Its booming agriculture and agribusiness based 
economy, however, is exemplary of one of the fastest growing 
sectors of Brazil\'s economy, and one that is beginning to 
affect world markets.  Goias\' efforts to deal with its state 
debt while finding creative ways to finance infrastructure 
investment and deal with social issues also reflect debates 
and trends at the national level.  Goias is also (in)famous 
as the source of a significant proportion of Brazilian 
illegal immigrants to the U.S. 
 
Economy 
------- 
 
3. (U) Goias is riding the wave of Brazil\'s agricultural 
boom.  In about twenty years, according to state Planning 
Secretary Humberto Tannus, Goias has become an agricultural 
 
SIPDIS 
powerhouse, introducing a multitude of new cash crops into 
what had been a sleepy rural economy dominated by family 
farms.  The state is now Brazil\'s leading producer of 
sorghum and tomatoes and among the leaders in soy, 
pineapples, corn, beans, chicken, beef, dairy and grains 
production.  Tannus put the state\'s growth rate last year at 
about 3%, according to preliminary data.  This compares very 
favorably with national GDP growth of minus 0.2%.  In fact, 
state data show growth rates consistently above the national 
average, with a recent peak of 5% in 2000. 
 
4. (U) According to the President of the Agriculture and 
Animal Husbandry Association (FAEG), Macel Caixeta, there is 
a growing diversification of agricultural production into 
other tropical fruits as well.  Tannus said exports, 
primarily of agricultural products, reached USD 1.1 bn last 
year, up from a few hundred million dollars just two years 
before.  The state\'s biggest export market is now China, 
which just overtook the Netherlands as the primary 
destination for the state\'s soybeans and other exports. 
Goias\' overall economy as a whole is becoming more 
diversified, with industry (much of it agribusiness, but 
including mining and manufacturing) making up about 34% of 
the economy, agriculture accounting for about 18% and 
services accounting for the remainder.  The state is now the 
third leading producer of clothing in Brazil, primarily for 
the domestic market. 
 
5. (U) Investment Department head Sergio Castro explained 
that Goias has been an aggressive user of tax incentives to 
lure business to the state and claimed that the program has 
had particular success in attracting agribusiness and 
distribution operations, as well as some heavy industry: 
Mitsubishi has an assembly plant in the state, and Daewoo 
reportedly is considering establishing a plant as well. 
Commerce Secretary Ridoval Chiareloto explained that the 
Secretariat was busy negotiating 500 11th-hour tax incentive 
 
SIPDIS 
agreements before the deadline for their elimination imposed 
by last year\'s tax reform. 
 
6. (U) Chiareloto and Castro claimed success in attracting 
players in the pharmaceutical industry to a pharmaceutical 
\"development pole\" in the city of Anapolis, not far from 
Brasilia.  They said U.S. multinational Johnson\'s was moving 
its distribution center for all of Brazil to centrally 
located Anapolis, attracted in part by the creation of a 
\"dry\" port, complete with airport, railroad and truck 
terminals and bonded warehousing facilities.  Brazilian 
pharmaceutical companies are already producing generics in 
Anapolis, they said, and European firms are also considering 
operating there.  Planning Secretary Tannus hopes that the 
Brazil\'s to-be-announced federal-level industrial policy, 
which lists pharmaceuticals as one of four priority areas, 
will also benefit Anapolis. 
 
FTAA 
---- 
 
7. (U) State Commerce Secretary Chiareloto told Econoff that 
farmers and businesses in the state welcome the opening of 
new markets that an FTAA would represent, but said Goianians 
are wary of U.S. protectionism in agriculture, the state\'s 
principal exports.  FAEG\'s Caixeta was more positive, saying 
that his association sees the U.S. as a \"partner\" in the 
FTAA process; he predicted that the FTAA would become a 
reality soon.  \"O Popular\" editor Cordeiro, perhaps a more 
detached observer, said his paper\'s polling indicates that 
there is not yet a fixed opinion on the FTAA among the 
broader public, because most Goianians are just awakening to 
the importance of exports. 
 
Public-Private Partnerships 
--------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Most interlocutors are looking at the federal level 
public-private partnerships (PPP) effort as a useful tool to 
attract private investment in infrastructure.  Planning 
Secretary Humberto Tannus noted that PPP-type arrangements 
 
SIPDIS 
have existed in Goias for some time on a piecemeal basis, 
primarily in the form of concessions.  The new federal bill 
on PPPs would provide an organizing framework and useful 
guarantees.  Goias has its own bill ready to be presented to 
the state legislature, which would combine into one 
framework these existing concessions, the state 
privatization committee (Conselho de Desestatizacao) and the 
new federal PPP effort.   Tannus acknowledged that, under 
the Fiscal Responsibility Law, Goias\' high debt level 
prevented it from giving budgetary guarantees to PPP 
projects, but claimed there are several potential 
workarounds.  These include pledging to the PPP effort 
existing state assets (he mentioned two different stadiums), 
contributions in kind such as real estate, and commitments 
to construct complementary infrastructure (roads, power 
lines, etc).  Tannus claimed some interest from companies 
that work infrastructure projects.  FAEG\'s Caixeta welcomed 
any effort that improved rural infrastructure, citing 
railroad development in particular as a key way to bring 
down transportation costs. 
 
9. (U) Transportation Agency chief of staff Valdir Marques 
told Econoff that the lack of investment by the federal 
government in maintaining federal highways was causing 
dramatic increases in traffic on state roads.  State roads, 
however, were designed primarily as feeder roads and were 
bearing up poorly under the increased loads, particularly of 
heavy trucks laden with the state\'s agricultural produce. 
The state began in 2002 a seven-year, USD 240 million-road 
repair program with an Inter American Development Bank 
(IADB) loan.  The program will rehabilitate 3000 kilometers 
of paved roads and pave an additional 1000 km of currently 
unpaved roads.  Using private contractors to build and 
maintain the road network, a relatively recent innovation, 
has reduced costs by 50%, according to Marques.  Marques 
claimed only several hundred kilometers of state roads are 
in bad condition (with several thousand more in fair 
condition).  Anecdotally, taxi drivers complained to Econoff 
of a plethora of \"awful\" stretches of highway, both federal 
and state, and noted that unusually heavy rains this summer 
had washed out a key bridge, requiring a one hundred 
kilometer detour in one case. 
 
GMOs and Free Range Cattle 
-------------------------- 
 
10.  (U) State Commerce Secretary Chiareloto and Investment 
Department Head Castro said the state is following closely 
the national debate on GMOs.  Since much of the state\'s 
soybean and grain crops are sold to European markets, there 
is a fear of losing market share to other countries or 
regions that can claim to be GMO-free.  They suggested that 
Brazil, given its continental size, could solve the problem 
using a regional approach.  Some regions could adopt GMOs 
while others do not, thus maintaining market share in both 
segments.  Extensive pasture in Goias means that ranchers 
have long raised free-range cattle, which are not given 
animal feed, according to both Chiareloto and FAEG\'s 
Caixeta.  They saw demand for the state\'s free-range cattle 
(boi verde) jump since the BSE scares in the UK and the U.S. 
They expect continued strong demand in this market niche. 
 
Debt and Budget 
--------------- 
 
11. (U) Although Goias is the fourth most heavily indebted 
Brazilian state, with an income to debt ratio of 240%, to a 
surprising extent this was a non-issue during conversations 
with the state finance secretariat.  As was the case with 
many other Brazilian states, the Federal Government took 
over responsibility for most Goianian debt (and receives 
monthly payments from the state.)   The state\'s revenue 
stream has been growing overall, reducing the sting of 
required debt repayments to the Federal Government.  Indeed, 
the state has elected to repay 50 million Reals a month (15% 
of revenue), two percentage points above the minimum debt 
repayment level of 13% of revenue.  The finance secretariat 
claimed that Goias was current on its debt payments and did 
not see any obstacle to continuing to pay down debt levels. 
Finance Secretariat Chief of Staff Guilherme Souza claimed 
further that much of Goias\' indebtedness was not due to 
state fiscal mismanagement, but because it chose, as part of 
the negotiation with the federal government, to take on debt 
owed by state-owned parastatals (sewage and power companies 
were cited).  This decision has left the parastatals free to 
take on new debt and thereby continue making critical 
infrastructure investments. 
 
Social Issues 
------------- 
 
12.  (U) Almost to a person, Econoff\'s interlocutors cited 
immigration from other parts of Brazil as one of the state\'s 
most pressing problems.  Dealing with this immigration has 
stressed social programs and budgets.  The state 
nevertheless needs immigrants with skills to fill some of 
the jobs being created in agri-business.  The editor of \"O 
Popular\", Isanulfo Cordeiro, cited the case of busloads of 
job-seekers that arrived after a story (in a competing 
newspaper) on vacant agribusiness jobs in Rio Verde, which 
hosts a large food-processing business, led by Brazilian 
company Perdigao.  Cordeiro labeled the report 
\'irresponsible\' for having omitted to state that the 
vacancies were for skilled workers.  He said penniless local 
authorities in Rio Verde had to seek donations to 
\"repatriate\" the desperate unskilled jobseekers, many of 
whom had borrowed money to get to Rio Verde and had none to 
return home.  Cordeiro assessed the quality of the state\'s 
educational system as reasonable, but noted it was of 
insufficient size to meet demand for skilled workers.  Some 
private vocational training programs, funded by business 
associations such as FAEG, help address the problem, but are 
targeted at specific sectors.  (Note: Rio Verde also hosts 
an Amcit Mennonite community.) 
 
13.  (U) FAEG\'s Caixeta said association members were 
alarmed at squatter invasions by the landless movement (MST) 
in some parts of Goias.  He alleged that the \"leftist\" Lula 
government was openly supporting the MST.  By contrast, he 
lauded Gov. Perillo\'s policy of not tolerating MST squatter 
invasions while trying to help the legitimately needy find 
housing.  Perillo has an eye for social issues without being 
a socialist, said Caixeta.  Planning Secretary Tannus 
enumerated a series of state-level social programs that 
combat hunger (a food-targeted stipend for families, and a 
people\'s restaurant, which provides balanced meals for one 
Real), help families keep their children in school (a 
targeted stipend), fight diseases with sanitation 
improvements at the household level, retrain unemployed 
workers, and provide micro-credit.  One other program aims 
ultimately to reduce squatter invasions by helping the rural 
poor to build or improve their own housing, so long as they 
can prove their ties to the given region.  \"O Popular\" 
editor Cordeiro lauded these programs to Econoff, noting 
that his newspaper\'s culinary column had published a 
favorable review of the one-Real restaurant. 
 
14.  (U) Lula\'s trademark \"Fome Zero\" program, Cordeiro 
added, has no resonance in Goias, because the existing state 
level program has been much more effective.  Separately, 
Planning Secretary Cannus, implying some reluctance, said 
the state is still negotiating with the federal government 
how to marry up \"Fome Zero\" with the state\'s \"Renda Cidada\" 
(Citizen\'s Income) program, which provides food stipends as 
well as exemptions from water and power bills for the most 
needy. 
 
15. (U) In a meeting with an association of small and micro 
entrepreneurs, several small business owners told Econoff 
that they struggle daily to deal with bureaucracy and 
inability to obtain credit.  Expressing frustration, the 
owner of a small business involved in telecommunications 
said he often feels the time spent trying to obtain credit 
would be better spent simply on better managing his 
business.  The president of the association complained that 
the government\'s micro-credit program for loans of 2000 - 
3000 Reals, while available at excellent interest rates (6% 
annual), still required guarantees equal to 50% of the 
borrowed amount.  A government-sponsored consultant to the 
association, Rodolfo Monteiro, said a study of small and 
medium enterprises (SMEs) showed that 40% of SMEs that could 
obtain credit never bother applying.  Other obstacles to SME 
development cited by the group include the Byzantine 
requirements of the labor law and bureaucratic hassles.  The 
association is thinking creatively about joint purchasing 
arrangements among members (e.g. for office equipment) to 
reduce costs through large volume purchases, as larger 
companies do. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
16.  (SBU) Goias\'s economy, thanks to agriculture and 
agribusiness, is doing better than much of Brazil.  It is 
clear, however, that the state is already coming up against 
infrastructure constraints that require substantial 
investment to de-bottleneck.  The state\'s debt levels make 
that an impossible task for its public sector.  And so, 
while it was clear that there is no love lost between PSDB 
Governor Perillo and Lula\'s PT-led federal government (which 
the PSDB on the national level opposes), Goias needs federal 
initiatives such as future PPPs and incentives for 
pharmaceuticals under the new industrial policy to attract 
new private investment in these areas.

1.  (C) Summary and Introduction:  Although the GOB is 
considering reopening a diplomatic mission in Baghdad, there 
has been no public mention of Brazilian intentions towards 
Afghanistan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MRE) Division 
Chief responsible for South Asia acknowledged a lack of focus 
on Afghanistan, but affirmed the GOB does desire ties with 
the Afghan Government. The USG, he suggested, could help 
overcome the MRE\'s bureaucratic inertia regarding joint 
diplomatic recognition with a friendly nudge in New York and 
Washington. He argued that the time is right to come to 
closure diplomatically; once ties are established, Brazil 
could find a way to assist in Phase IV reconstruction 
efforts. End Summary 
 
2.  (C) Poloff delivered powerpoint presentation on Coalition 
nation building efforts in Afghanistan to Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MRE) Division Chief for Asia and Oceania Oswaldo 
Biato Junior.  Biato appreciated the presentation, admitted 
that Afghanistan had not received adequate MRE attention, and 
agreed that Brazil, as a current UNSC member, ought to be 
more engaged in Afghan issues. To explain the lack of focus, 
he noted bureaucratic factors.  For example, the MRE 
traditionally uses its representative in Tehran to cover 
Afghanistan -- even though Iran is under a different MRE 
division (Near East). Biato\'s own tiny division of four 
officers is responsible for all of South Asia and China. 
Recent and upcoming visits of President Lula and Foreign 
Minister Amorin to the region have absorbed all their energy. 
Meanwhile, Afghanistan remains far away and out of sight. 
 
3.  (SBU) While Brazil had enjoyed diplomatic relations with 
Afghanistan since the 1950s, Biato acknowledged he was 
unaware of any formal contact with a GOA since the Russian 
invasion in 1979. However, unlike Iraq, Afghanistan poses no 
policy difficulties for the GOB. The GOB is supportive of the 
Bonn Process, understands the importance of Afghanistan in 
the war on terrorism, and has no problem with recognizing the 
Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan (ITGA). 
 
4.  (C) Biato noted that the Afghan Ambassador in Washington 
recently had approached his Brazilian counterpart three times 
to request permission to present his credentials in Brasilia. 
Bureaucratic inertia is at fault, Biato said, for the lack of 
movement to respond affirmatively. The GOB would have no 
objection to receiving him, Biato said. The division chief 
suggested that specific messages of support from Brazilian 
ambassadors in Washington and New York to the MRE could 
provide the needed bureaucratic nudge and he suggested that 
USUN approach the Brazilian delegation to urge it to 
communicate with MRE in favor of Brazilian recognition of the 
ITGA. 
 
5.  (C) The timing for formalizing Afghan-Brazilian 
relations, Biato sensed, is right. The MRE has decided to 
remove Afghanistan from the plate of their Tehran ambassador 
and give the portfolio to Islamabad. A new ambassador to 
Pakistan, Fausto Godoy, has just been confirmed and will be 
consulting with MRE shortly before departing for Islamabad. 
Biato said that Godoy is eager to travel to Kabul. Moreover, 
diplomatic ties with Afghanistan could help bolster Brazil\'s 
claim for a permanent UN Security Council seat -- an argument 
Biato wanted to highlight to senior MRE leadership. 
 
6.  (C) Once diplomatic relations are in place, Brazil may be 
eager to help in some way. Biato pointed out that the GOB has 
not received any specific request from the UN or the 
Coalition for assistance, but there are areas in which Brazil 
can contribute.  For example, Brazil had expertise in 
\"elections infrastructure and technology\" that might be 
applicable to Afghanistan\'s developmental circumstances. 
Poloff pointed out that it would be more useful for Brazil to 
identify how it could help, perhaps following an 
investigative mission to Afghanistan, than to expect the 
Coalition or the ITGA to come to it with specific requests. 
Biato also described the GOB\'s G-3 (Brazil, South Africa, 
India) efforts to find common ground for development 
assistance programs. India, in particular, he opined, might 
welcome a joint effort with Brazil to assist Afghanistan. 
While Brazil has few financial resources to dedicate to 
Afghanistan, in-kind support, perhaps in conjunction with 
Indian personnel, could be made available, Biato said.

1.  (SBU) Summary:  In 2003 the incoming Lula administration 
asserted it would refocus its foreign policy to place greater 
emphasis on Africa.  Some African diplomats here, however, 
believe that Brazilian interest in their countries has 
remained unchanged, despite the rhetoric. While they admit 
they may be out of the loop on issues dealt with in New York 
or Geneva, the diplomats could identify no specific

except for South Africa and the lusophone countries -- 
countries already marked for closer ties. They were also 
apprehensive that Haiti could distract Brazil from future 
African peacekeeping efforts.  The griping may be premature, 
but given recent GOB behavior, other areas of the globe may 
be capturing Brazil\'s interest, at least for now.   End 
Summary 
 
2.  (U) Since taking office in January 2003, the Lula 
Administration has emphasized its intention to rethink 
Brazil\'s foreign policy and, in particular, place increased 
focus on Africa. In various fora during the first six months 
of his administration, President Lula specifically targeted 
Africa, emphasizing Brazil\'s deep historical and cultural 
ties to the continent and the commonality of interests.  As 
noted reftel, this policy stems from President Lula\'s desire 
to demonstrate Brazil\'s leadership as an advocate for Third 
World issues and in global trade interests, which in turn 
will bolster Brazil\'s bid for a permanent UN Security Council 
seat. 
 
3.  (SBU) From one perspective, however, the reality of 
Brazil\'s new African focus has not, so far, met expectations. 
In an informal luncheon with poloffs, senior diplomats from 
Senegal, Cote d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, and Angola described the Lula 
Administration\'s Africa-oriented foreign policy as more 
rhetoric than fact. True, they conceded, both President Lula 
and Foreign Minister Amorin visited Africa in 2003.  But the 
countries visited, the diplomats said, reflected existing GOB 
priorities to strengthen Brazil\'s leadership role among 
lusophone countries (Angola, Mozambique, Sao Tome & Principe, 
Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau) and ties with South Africa.  The 
diplomats, a few of whom have served in Brazil for many 
years, could point to no obvious change in GOB policy or 
attention towards their nations. 
 
4.  (SBU) The diplomats admitted that many issues of concern 
between their governments and Brazil -- particularly those 
involving the World Trade Organization -- are conducted in 
New York or Geneva, leaving their embassies out of the loop. 
Yet, it still appeared that the GOB was more concerned with 
counting heads for UNSC reform -- and support for Brazil\'s 
bid for permanent UNSC seat -- than in being a champion of 
Africa\'s interests, supporting African peacekeeping, or 
augmenting trade. The diplomats could not identify any 
examples of expanded commercial opportunities for African 
products nor any common trade negotiation strategies that 
would benefit Africa.  Several noted that Brazil and many 
African countries produce similar agricultural products and 
therefore Brazil is a competitor rather than a benefactor. 
 
5.  (SBU)  As one constraint to closer Brazil-Africa ties, 
all cited the dearth, difficulty, and expense of flights 
between Brazil and Africa.  Except for flights to 
Johannesburg and Luanda (not noted as a aviation hub), the 
diplomats could identify no direct service between Brazil and 
Africa. Instead, travelers had to transit Europe at great 
cost and significant delay. To remedy this, a few urged that 
the Brazilian Government press airlines to open up routes 
across the Atlantic. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Brazil\'s recent commitment of over one thousand 
peacekeepers to Haiti, as opposed to the GOB\'s paucity of 
commitment to African peacekeeping, was perceived as evidence 
of Brazil\'s true lack of interest in Africa\'s problems.  A 
few added that even if Brazil had been thinking of Africa 
before, Haiti would be a significant distraction and 
impediment to any future African peacekeeping mission. 
Diplomats from the DRC and Cote d\'Ivoire, countries often 
mentioned by the GOB as possible peacekeeping focal points, 
stated there had been no effort by the Foreign Ministry to 
engage with them.  (Note: In a recent meeting senior Foreign 
Ministry officials confirmed to poloffs that GOB interest in 
participating in a Cote d\'Ivoire PKO had been eclipsed by 
Haiti. End Note) 
 
7.  (SBU)  Comment: It may still be relatively early in the 
Lula administration to point to Brazil-Africa success 
stories, and we note the GOB\'s interest in HIV/AIDs relief 
efforts in Africa seems unabated.  Some of the complaints 
leveled against the GOB may be premature but the diplomats 
make a legitimate point. The Africa-focus rhetoric aside, 
Brazil\'s current foreign policy emphasis on South 
American/Caribbean and major, like-minded developing nations 
(ex. South Africa, India, China) may leave little room for 
paying closer attention to Africa.

REF: PLOWMAN-OPIC EMAILS 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified, please protect accordingly. 
 
1. (SBU) Econoff raised with Central Bank Deputy Governor 
for International Affairs Alexandre Schwartsman on February 
19 the difficulties that an OPIC-financed investment fund, 
the Global Environmental Emerging Markets Fund II (GEEMF) is 
experiencing with its $18 million investment in the state of 
Parana sanitation utility, Sanepar.  Econoff explained that 
the OPIC-financed investment, made through two 
intermediaries (Opportunity Daleth and the Domino group), 
formed part of the purchase of a minority stake in Sanepar 
during its partial privatization.  The rights of the private 
shareholders brought into the company were secured through a 
shareholders agreement that was subsequently de facto 
abrogated by state governor Requiao, who had in addition 
removed from the Sanepar board the directors named by the 
private investors. 
 
2. (SBU) Schwartsman was very sympathetic and gave us to 
understand that the GoB sees Requiao\'s actions as 
indefensible.  He went on to say, however, that the Federal 
Government has limited means of dealing with Requiao\'s de 
facto abrogation of the shareholders agreement.  Schwartsman 
clearly understood the potential for this to become a 
central-government to central-government issue should OPIC 
become subrogated to the U.S. private investor.  He 
also perceived the danger of decreased investor confidence 
for purposes of promoting investment through Public-Private- 
Partnerships (PPPs), currently under consideration by the 
Brazilian Congress.  Schwartsman recommended that the 
private investors pursue action through the CVM (SEC- 
equivalent) and/or local courts, but, when asked, did not 
know if Brazilian law allows for the central government to 
file an \"amicus\" brief supporting the investor\'s case.  He 
did not think Brazil\'s Fiscal Responsibility Law provided 
any federal leverage, because Requiao\'s actions diluting the 
private shareholders\' stake in Sanepar do not affect the 
State of Parana\'s net debt levels. 
 
3. (SBU) Schwartsman drew a parallel to another infamous 
case of a few years ago, that of the electrical company of 
the state of Minas Gerais (CEMIG).  Then-governor Itamar 
Franco removed the board members representing the private 
investors (which included U.S. company AES) who had bought 
in during a partial privatization, as Requiao has now done 
with Sanepar.  Even though the federal government of the 
time disagreed vehemently with the actions of the state 
government, it was unable legally to intervene.  Despite his 
pessimism about finding a concrete option to help, 
Schwartsman undertook to follow up within the Central Bank 
and with colleagues in the Finance Ministry.  Econoff left 
with him an OPIC white paper on the case. 
 
4. (SBU) In a March 25 follow-up meeting, Schwartsman 
relayed that he and his Ministry of Finance colleagues had 
concluded that the federal government has no way to act in 
the Sanepar case, as the facts currently stand.  He said all 
his colleagues were aware of the potential damage to 
Brazil\'s ability to attract investment.  When pressed, 
Schwartsman clarified that he and his colleagues had not 
considered how the CVM might be brought into play in its 
regulatory role.  He suggested, since the Central Bank has 
little or no enforcement power outside of its banking 
supervision role, that post follow up with Finance Ministry 
Executive Director Bernardo Appy. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment.  While post will follow up with the 
Finance Ministry, the CEMIG precedent is illustrative of the 
limits that the federal government faces in dealing with 
governors whose actions, however egregiously a breach of 
shareholders\' agreements, do not apparently represent a 
violation of federal law in the view of the GoB.

SUBJECT: FTAA: INITIAL BUENOS AIRES FALLOUT IN BRASILIA 
 
REF: BUENOS AIRES 1009 
 
Classified By: ECONOFF JANICE FAIR FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) AND (d) 
 
1. (U)  Summary.  Following the informal FTAA discussions in 
Buenos Aires March 31-April 1, which ended without agreement 
(reftel), Brazilian Foreign Ministry (Itamaraty) officials 
launched an aggressive media campaign to get the word out 
that U.S. intransigence was to blame for the impasse. 
Foreign Minister Amorim was widely quoted, claiming a U.S. 
pullback from the compromise achieved in the FTAA Ministerial 
in Miami last November.   Although the level of public 
outrage was lower than that following the Trinidad & Tobago 
TNC meeting last year, the private sector and other 
ministries have apparently communicated to Itamaraty their 
consternation regarding its negotiating posture.  Despite 
headlines heralding an end to the FTAA, high-level officials 
from the Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC) 
informed Ambassador that the GoB has not abandoned the FTAA 
negotiations and is formulating new proposals, including 
improved market access offers.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Blame Game 
---------- 
 
2.  (U) Immediately following adjournment of the informal 
FTAA discussions in Buenos Aires, Itamaraty launched a media 
blitz to assign blame for the impasse that prevented progress 
in negotiating a common set of rights and obligations under 
the new FTAA framework.  U.S., and to a lesser extent 
Canadian, intransigence was identified as the main culprit. 
In interviews and in discussions with members of Brazil\'s 
Congress, Foreign Minister Amorim accused the U.S. of trying 
to reopen the Miami Ministerial compromise, most probably in 
reference to a proposal to allow for additional provisions in 
the common set in the future.  He reiterated Brazilian claims 
that the U.S. is unwillingly to provide real market access 
for Brazilian agricultural products, specifically in 
addressing domestic support and export subsidies, while it is 
trying to reintroduce new rules in Brazil\'s sensitive areas 
of services, investment, IPR and government procurement.  As 
in the past, Amorim argued for moving on from the 
\"philosophical\" discussion on rules and instead beginning 
market access negotiations; he reaffirmed that Brazil will 
not negotiate services market access in any format other than 
bilateral.  On April 7 and 8, there was widespread reporting 
on the contents of a letter Minister Amorim sent to USTR 
Zoellick on April 5, outlining GoB concerns with U.S. 
positions within the common set negotiations. 
 
3.  (U) Similar commentary was attributed to Regis Arslanian 
and Tovar da Silva Nunes, Director General of Itamaraty\'s 
Trade Negotiations Department, and Head of its FTAA Division, 
respectively.  In addition to bemoaning the lack of U.S. 
flexibility, Nunes asserted to journalists that the outcome 
of the Buenos Aires talks had prompted Itamaraty to shift its 
trade policy focus toward negotiation of agreements with some 
30 developing countries, with the EU, and toward WTO trade 
talks.  Negotiations with the EU were singled out as 
exemplifying a more collaborative process than the FTAA and a 
higher probability of success, a questionable assertion. 
Striking a more balanced tone, Amorim told Brazilian Deputies 
on April 6 that the GoB plans to focus more on the WTO 
negotiations, unwilling to concede anything within the 
regional FTAA or bi-regional EU agreements that would 
undermine Brazil\'s interests within the global trade talks. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Not Everyone is On Board with Itamaraty 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) Despite Itamaraty\'s best efforts, not everyone 
appeared to accept its characterization of the problems 
besetting the negotiations nor its supposed readjustment in 
policy focus.  While less public than after the contentious 
Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) meeting in Trinidad & 
Tobago last September, press reports cited divergent 
positions within the GoB, and private sector demands that 
Itamaraty demonstrate more flexibility in the FTAA 
negotiations.  In addition, an \"O Estado\" editorial last 
weekend refused to play the blame game and called for 
Itamaraty flexibility, pointing out how much Brazil stands to 
lose from failure of FTAA negotiations. 
 
5.  (C) MDIC\'s more forward leaning position on the FTAA was 
confirmed in informal discussions with Minister Furlan and 
staff during a dinner hosted by Ambassador April 7.  DCM, 
Deputy Senior Commercial Officer and Econoff also attended. 
Mario Mugnaini, Executive Secretary of Camex, the GoB\'s 
formal decision-making body for trade policy, rejected 
assertions that the GoB does not want to negotiate the FTAA. 
However, he conceded that subsequent to the informal Buenos 
Aires talks, Itamaraty is being forced to moderate its 
positions.  He was adamant that pressure from, among others, 
Minister Furlan would ensure a more pragmatic approach by 
Brazilian negotiators in the future, and argued that TNC 
Co-Chars should meet soon to consider how to get the process 
moving again. 
 
6. (C) Expressing optimism on an eventual successful outcome 
for the FTAA, Mugnaini pressed the Brazilian line that the 
current impasse on the common set language would more easily 
be overcome if market access negotiations could proceed 
immediately.  At least part of Mugnaini\'s optimism seems to 
flow from his expectations of a positive response by the U.S. 
toward improved Mercosul market access offers in goods, 
services and investment, which he intimated would be unveiled 
soon.  (Note, one press report admitted that Mercosul\'s 
initial goods market access offer was the \"worst\" of any FTAA 
delegation.)  Ambassador insisted that Brazil must work 
seriously according to the directions from Ministers in Miami 
and negotiate the common set before market access talks could 
begin.  Mugnaini made references to Itamaraty moving \"in the 
right direction\" regarding positions on common set issues, 
but provided no further detail.  Articles the same day 
reported a lack of support within the Ministries of 
Development, Agriculture, and Finance, as well as within the 
private sector, for Itamaraty\'s insistence on including 
within the common set a mechanism to compensate for 
agricultural domestic support within the U.S. and Canada. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Recent events and statements would seem to confirm 
Itamaraty\'s lack of commitment toward the FTAA negotiations. 
That being said, there remain pro-FTAA forces within the 
Brazilian government and private sector that make it very 
difficult for Itamaraty to just walk away.  There is plenty 
of room for continued mischief, however.  The GoB will likely 
continue to press for four-plus-one market access talks to 
begin forthwith.  Eventually, Itamaraty may present a 
reformulation of some of its positions within the common set 
talks, but these may not prove useful in bridging the gaps 
that currently exist between FTAA delegations.  We suspect 
that representatives from other ministries and from the 
private sector who are pushing for more flexibility by 
Itamaraty, may not prove as effective checks on Itamaraty 
excesses as would be hoped, due to a less than full 
appreciation of the nuances within the common set text 
negotiations. 
 
8.  (C) Post recommends a continued neutral posture regarding 
blame for an inability to reach consensus on the common set 
elements so that domestic interests will have the space to 
make their own case for a change in GoB posture.  However, 
reinforcement of the message that what we are seeking is a 
\"balanced\" common set would be helpful in keeping the focus 
on revising or eliminating the more problematic GoB positions.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  After months of relative quiet, Brazil\'s 
Landless Movement (MST) has initiated a wave of land 
occupations timed to coincide with the anniversary of a 1996 
massacre.  Many occupations are in the northeastern state of 
Pernambuco, where other groups besides MST are active.  In 
Bahia, the invasion of a cellulose plantation pits the 
administration\'s populist impulses against its need to 
protect agribusiness investments.  MST\'s best known leader 
called for a \"Red April\" of actions, but later toned down his 
rhetoric, saying MST is not trying to undermine the 
government but is impatient with slow progress on the 
National Agrarian Reform Plan.  The government has now 
authorized R$1.7 billion (about US$570 million) to get the 
National Plan back on track, but it is not clear if or when 
the money will actually be made available.  MST\'s 
high-profile activities attract great attention but at 
present are neither as numerous nor as violent as in the late 
1990s.  With the Lula administration torn between its support 
for agrarian reform and its responsibilities to agribusiness, 
public security, and fiscal austerity, there may be some 
modest progress made, but MST will not reduce its pressure. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
APRIL OCCUPATIONS BECOMING AN ANNUAL RITE 
----------------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) On April 17, 1996, nineteen landless activists were 
killed by police in the town of Eldorado do Carajas in the 
northern Brazilian state of Para.  (N.b., only two of 145 
defendants were ever convicted, and they remain free on 
appeal.)  The massacre gained international attention and was 
a watershed for the Landless Rural Workers\' Movement (MST), 
radicalizing it further and turning it against the Cardoso 
government.  MST, established in 1984, is Brazil\'s primary 
agitator for agrarian reform (refs A, B).  Its demands are 
built around the proven tactic of occupation of farmland by 
hundreds of landless families until the government cedes 
title.  In its early years, MST typically occupied lands that 
were unproductive or where title was in doubt, but after the 
1996 massacre, the movement became far more belligerent and 
just as likely to invade government buildings, productive 
farms, or land owned by multinationals in order to score 
political points. 
 
3. (SBU) In recent years, MST has organized growing waves of 
occupations and demonstrations in late-March/early-April to 
coincide with the anniversary of the 1996 massacre.  Since 
mid-March, MST and other groups have carried out a 
coordinated campaign of at least 53 land invasions (the 
number grows daily) in fourteen states involving 15,000 
landless families, plus road blockades and demonstrations. 
Much of the activity is in the northeastern state of 
Pernambuco, where many of the 25 reported occupations are led 
not by MST but by FETAPE (\"Pernambuco State Agricultural 
Workers\' Federation\"), a rival organization that has tactical 
and ideological differences with MST. 
 
PERNAMBUCO - LATEST HOTBED OF OCCUPATIONS 
----------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) FETAPE has organized a reported 19 occupations in 
Pernambuco in recent weeks --it claims to have mobilized 
1,900 families-- but is careful to set up its camps outside 
target plantations to avoid running afoul of MP 2183.  This 
Presidential Decree, issued by a frustrated President Cardoso 
in May 2000 and still in force, bars for two years the 
government from expropriating and redistributing lands that 
are illegally occupied.  The Decree sharply reduced land 
invasions, forcing activists to develop alternatives  --such 
as setting up camps along roadsides or at plantation gates, 
or occupying government offices.  FETAPE President Aristides 
dos Santos says his organization now has a total of 153 camps 
in Pernambuco comprising 9,400 families, but because of MP 
2183, it has not occupied any of the 95 unproductive farms 
that it is pressing the state to expropriate. 
 
5. (SBU) MST\'s leader in Pernambuco, Jaime Amorim, has no 
such compunctions.  MST has occupied six farms this month, 
essentially taking them off the table for redistribution for 
two years.  MST may be particularly radicalized in Pernambuco 
precisely because of intense competition from other activist 
groups.  Not only FETAPE, but also MAST, MLST, MPA, MTBST, 
MTB, MTL, MTR, MTRUB, OLC, UAPE, and COOPTERRA are active, to 
greater or lesser degrees.  OLC (\"Organization for Struggle 
in the Fields\"), for example, is more likely to occupy 
productive large-scale farms.  Amorim blames the government 
for Pernambuco troubles, saying \"INCRA (the GoB\'s agrarian 
reform agency) did not expropriate either occupied or 
unoccupied areas\".  INCRA\'s state director Joao Farias 
(himself a former MST activist) is more sympathetic to 
FETAPE\'s tactic of providing the state with lists of likely 
farms, rather than occupying them outright.  Farias told us 
that the immediate situation is not as explosive as depicted 
in the press, but if unaddressed, Pernambuco\'s agrarian 
crisis is a \"potential powder keg\". 
 
6. (SBU) The land problem in Pernambuco is rooted in its 
historical sugar economy that promoted the creation of 
enormous plantations worked by families of cane-cutters who 
subsisted on their own small plots.  Since the 1980s, sugar 
mills have been failing, leaving an estimated 50,000 families 
with neither land nor steady wage employment.  The result is 
a corps of hungry underemployed fieldworkers who have swelled 
the ranks of MST and the other landless organizations. 
Worse, the GoB\'s INCRA is chronically underfunded and has not 
resettled a single landless family in Pernambuco in 2004 
(though its officials say it is processing sites that it 
hopes to redistribute later this year).  INCRA\'s Farias told 
us that only 11,500 families have been resettled in 
Pernambuco in the past forty years --perhaps 20% of the 
landless. 
 
BAHIA - AGRIBUSINESS TRUMPS OCCUPATION 
-------------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) In what is reportedly the largest-ever land invasion 
in the state of Bahia, on 4 April, 2,500 families organized 
by MST seized a 53-acre plantation near Porto Seguro, 
destroying eucalyptus trees (a source of cellulose for paper 
products).  The farm is owned by Veracel (a joint venture 
with a Swedish-Finnish partner), and supplies the firm\'s new 
nearby pulp mill, soon to be the world\'s largest.  Last year, 
Lula met with Veracel officials to laud their decision to 
invest US$1.25 billion in the Bahia operation --the largest 
single foreign investment during his administration.  The GoB 
condemned the Veracel occupation, calling it bad for Brazil 
and bad for business, adding that the government would never 
expropriate the site.  On April 8, MST appeared ready to call 
off the invasion in return for an INCRA pledge to speed 
redistribution of 12,000 acres already expropriated.  MST 
periodically seizes productive farms, particularly those 
owned by multinationals (in 2003 it occupied several Monsanto 
sites to protest the cultivation of biotech crops - ref D). 
 
NATIONAL PLAN - LESS THAN HOPED 
------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) Lula\'s commitment to the landless dates to the early 
1980s when the PT party and MST grew up together.  During his 
1994 presidential campaign he said, \"With a single pen 
stroke, I\'ll give you so much land you won\'t be able to 
occupy it\".  As President, he has learned that the problem is 
not so easily solved.  In November 2003, Lula unveiled his 
National Agrarian Reform Plan (ref C), pledging to resettle 
400,000 landless families by the end of his term in December 
2006.  The plan\'s novelty was to link land distribution to 
measures making the farms viable, such as technical 
assistance, infrastructure, and credit.  The National Plan is 
good on paper but is far from being fulfilled.  According to 
statistics released by the GoB\'s agrarian reform agency 
INCRA, only 36,800 families were resettled in 2003 
(two-thirds of them in the Amazon region).  This left the 
administration far short of its goal of resettling 60,000 
families in its first year and means that it will have to 
resettle 121,000 families in each of the next three years to 
reach the goal of 400,000 families. 
 
MST LEADER\'S RED HOT RHETORIC... 
-------------------------------- 
9. (SBU) Joao Pedro Stedile, MST\'s founder and best-known 
leader, often makes unhelpful comments (last year he called 
for \'war on landowners\'), announcing recently, \"April will be 
a red month.  We are going to make life hell.  April will 
catch fire.\"  Listening to sharp criticism during a later 
congressional hearing, Stedile backtracked, saying he meant 
\"to \'pester\' the government not make its life hell\" and that 
\"Red April refers to our flags\".  MST, he said, \"does not 
seek to destabilize the government but to spur debate\".  He 
also apologized for a comment by fellow MST leader Jaime 
Amorim that \"for every one of us they kill, we\'ll kill ten.\" 
Stedile noted that \"it is stupid for us to use violence 
because we end up paying.  The ones who die are on our side.\" 
 In an April 5 interview he explained that after the November 
2003 announcement of the National Plan, MST did not halt its 
invasions because of any truce with the GoB, but rather 
focused on (non-invasion) activities, such as organizing its 
base and developing its training programs.  MST, he said, 
ended 2003 with 200,000 families camped at 700 sites.  True 
to form, he added, \"The government should give signals that 
it is on the side of the poor against the rich\".  He also 
listed Lula\'s best ministers as ForMin Celso Amorim (\"has the 
courage to confront the gringos, wins \'Brazilian of the Year\' 
award\"); and Environment Minister Marina Silva (\"defends our 
people from Monsanto and the handful of loggers who want to 
control the Amazon\"). 
 
...AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE 
-------------------------------- 
10. (SBU) On April 2, Lula appeared to respond to Stedile\'s 
\"Red April\" comments by announcing that R$1.7 billion (about 
US$570 million) would be allocated to the Ministry of 
Agrarian Development to support the National Plan.  Denying 
that he was acting only because MST was the squeaky wheel, he 
said, \"Agrarian reform is an issue of social justice, we will 
not be forced into it by the shouters\".  Lula recommitted his 
government to fulfill the Plan\'s targets, and Agrarian 
Development Minister Rossetto added that Lula had promised 
funding for 115,000 settlements in 2004. 
 
11. (SBU) INCRA\'s Chief of Staff, Viviane Coimbra, told us 
that the National Plan is sound and INCRA can meet the 
resettlement goal \"if we get the funding\".  But she is not 
optimistic that even the 2004 money would be forthcoming in 
this tight fiscal environment.  She does not believe the Plan 
will be fulfilled.  Stedile sounded a bit more charitable, 
saying, \"The main thing about (Lula\'s) announcement was not 
the amount of money, but the government\'s declaration that 
resources will not be an obstacle to meeting the goal of 
400,000 families.\"  Opposition Senator Alvaro Dias (PSDB), 
who chaired the hearing at which Stedile appeared, feels that 
the R$1.7 billion is not sufficient and that in any case 
INCRA lacks structure and competence to carry out the Plan, 
noting, \"There is a large pocket of poverty in the 
countryside and social pressure will be even greater if the 
Plan is not successful\".  He pointed out that land 
occupations damage the agribusiness sector that accounted for 
42% of Brazil\'s exports last year. 
 
COMMENT - BLOODY LAND DISPUTES HAVE BEEN BLOODIER 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
12. (SBU) The bout of national angst sparked by MST\'s 
March/April invasions has become an annual event, generating 
attention for the landless and criticism from the press.  But 
this year is running about the same as last year in terms of 
numbers of invasions and violence, and far below the peak 
1998-1999 period, when memories of the 1996 massacre were 
fresh and MST was in open conflict with the Cardoso 
government.  The following are GoB statistics (similar 
statistics compiled by the Catholic Church\'s Pastoral Land 
Commission show the same trends but run higher in absolute 
numbers): 
 
YEAR:                        1999  2002  2003  2004 
TOTAL ANNUAL OCCUPATIONS:    502      183   202 
OCCUPATIONS IN MARCH:        101      7   30     40 
DEATHS IN AGRARIAN CONFLICTS: 101    20    42     2 
 
13. (SBU) Lula\'s competing impulses --defending agrarian 
reform while also supporting agribusiness, public security, 
and fiscal austerity-- will be on display in the coming weeks 
as MST\'s \"Red April\" reaches its climax.  Expect continued 
hardline rhetoric from landless leaders, matched by lip 
service from administration officials on both sides of the 
issue.  Some budget resources are likely to be freed for 
agrarian reform, though not enough to meet the National 
Plan\'s targets.  On the other hand, MST will offer no truce 
in its land invasions --it never does-- whether or not the 
government meets its demands.

SUBJECT:  LULA BACKS TRADE MINISTER FURLAN AGAINST BNDES\'S 
LESSA 
 
Ref:  (A) 03 Brasilia 3813, (B) 03 Brasilia 3701 
 
1.  President Lula has arbitrated a very public victory for 
Development, Industry and Trade Minister Luiz Furlan in 
Furlan\'s latest policy bout with the old-school-leftist- 
ideologue president of Brazil\'s National Bank for Economic 
and Social Development (BNDES), Carlos Lessa.  The fight was 
over BNDES\'s introduction on March 1 of new guidelines that 
would have compelled \"foreign\" companies to pay up to 1.5% 
more than \"national\" ones on certain categories of loans 
from BNDES, which for practical purposes is Brazil\'s sole 
domestic source of major long-term financing for commercial 
as well as development projects. 
 
2.  Lessa\'s excuse for his new, discriminatory guidelines 
was that \"Brazilian\" companies are supposedly disadvantaged 
by their inability to access loans on the international 
market.  Furlan on April 1 sent Lessa a written directive to 
revoke the measure, on the grounds that (i) it conflicts 
with GoB policy and Brazil\'s self-interest in attracting 
foreign investment; (ii) differentiation between domestic 
and foreign capital is problematical in a transnational 
business age; and (iii) BNDES now has abundant funds to 
lend, the GoB having authorized its budget to be increased 
43% this year, to Reals 47 billion (about US$15.6 billion). 
 
3.  Despite the fact that BNDES bureaucratically exists as 
part of the Furlan\'s ministry, Lessa made known that he 
viewed Furlan\'s written instruction as a request rather than 
an order, and BNDES as being \"supervised by,\" not 
subordinate to, the Minister.  On April 13, Lula\'s Chief of 
Staff Dirceu transmitted to Lessa the President\'s direct 
order to repeal his March 1 measure.  A hastily-convened 
session of the BNDES board did so that evening, but stressed 
that it was doing so only in obedience to President Lula, 
with no mention of Furlan. 
 
4.  COMMENT.  Lula\'s appointment of the leftist academic 
Lessa to head BNDES in early 2003 was a consolation prize to 
the Workers\' Party\'s (PT) traditionalist economic dogmatists 
who had been conspicuously shut out of the major economic- 
policy positions in the new GoB.  Furlan resisted it vainly 
then, and has had recurrent run-ins with Lessa since, 
including over a major BNDES investment decision last 
November when Lula slapped Lessa down (Reftels.)  Although 
Lessa remains in place, Lula\'s backing of Furlan\'s pro- 
foreign-investment approach in this latest skirmish shows 
once again his unambiguous, pragmatic rejection of the old- 
style PT mindset.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL AND U.S. HOLD FRANK, CONSTRUCTIVE TALKS ON 
NUCLEAR NON-NONPROLIFERATION ISSUES 
 
 
Classified By: Sci/C Daniel Rubinstein; Reasons 1.5 (B), (D). 
 
1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: U.S.-Brazil policy discussions in the 
Joint Standing Committee for Nuclear Energy Cooperation were 
positive, non-confrontational, and useful to both sides. 
While Brazil did not express new policy positions on 
high-profile issues such as the Additional Protocol (AP) or 
the Resende enrichment facility safeguards in these talks, 
the Brazilian interaction with the USDEL strongly suggests 
that the GoB is feeling the need to respond to IAEA pressure 
regarding the Resende enrichment facility, and that the GoB 
is reviewing its position on the AP.  A/S Wolf emphasized 
that universal adherence to the AP is a keen interest of the 
U.S., and that while the USG is not pressuring the GoB, it is 
pressing the IAEA to strengthen the credibility of the 
safeguard system across the board.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) The first U.S.-Brazil Joint Standing Committee on 
Nuclear Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC) opened April 14 in 
Brasilia.  The USDEL was led by A/S for Non-Proliferation 
John Wolf, and included representatives from State, DOE, the 
NRC, and three national laboratories.  The Brazilian side was 
led by the Foreign Ministry\'s Director for International 
Organizations (A/S-equivalent) Antonio Guerreiro and included 
Ambassador at Large for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation 
Sergio Duarte, representatives from the Foreign and S&T 
Ministries, and the National Nuclear Energy Commission 
(CNEN).  Technical-level discussions on safeguards, nuclear 
security and safety, and technical cooperation will occur in 
Rio de Janeiro April 15-16.  Septel will cover A/S Wolf\'s 
April 13-14 meetings with Guerreiro, Duarte, and Defense 
Minister Viegas. 
 
3. (C/NF) After a brief look back at U.S.-Brazilian nuclear 
ties, A/S Wolf reviewed the key elements of the President\'s 
February National Defense University address, as well as 
global developments and abuse of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that led to this new policy 
direction.  Wolf urged that Brazil show leadership on 
non-proliferation and that there be no distance between 
Brazil and the U.S. on the non-proliferation front. 
Emphasizing the centrality of the AP to U.S. efforts, Wolf 
highlighted the recent advice and consent of the U.S. Senate 
to the AP and encouraged Brazil to consider signing the AP as 
well.  Wolf noted that the Resende enrichment facility 
safeguards issue is one to be settled by the GoB with the 
IAEA, not with the U.S.  The USG is, however, pressing the 
IAEA to strengthen the NPT safeguards system across the 
board.  IAEA Director General El-Baradei has spoken of the 
need to \"close the loopholes,\" and the U.S. fully agrees. 
The USG will continue to work hard to prevent the spread of 
proliferation-sensitive fuel cycle technologies.  The U.S. is 
comfortable with the IAEA\'s commitment to preserve the 
confidentiality of sensitive technologies, and Brazil needs 
 
SIPDIS 
to work with the IAEA to reach a similar comfort level.  Wolf 
urged the GoB to accelerate discussions with the IAEA 
regarding the Resende facility. 
 
4. (C/NF) In response, Brazilian Delegation Head Guerreiro 
reiterated long-standing GoB points on the need for the 
disarmament leg of the NPT to receive equal attention and for 
universal adherence to the NPT to precede the 
universalization of the AP.  On Resende, Guerreiro said the 
GoB has \"complete confidence\" that it will reach agreement 
with the IAEA about a safeguards regime; since the facility 
is not yet operational, it is not yet time for it to be 
safeguarded.  Guerreiro explicitly acknowledged that it is 
the IAEA, not the USG, that is pressuring the GoB on the 
Resende issue. 
 
5. (SBU) After the USDEL presentation on the USG\'s own AP 
implementation plans in the afternoon session, the Brazilians 
queried the USDEL in detail on several fronts, including our 
interpretation and use of the national security exclusion, 
our understanding of the measures that can be used under the 
\"managed access\" regime, and our preliminary estimates of the 
costs associated with compliance with the AP.  The exchanges 
were substantive, candid, and constructive.  USDEL suggested 
that Brazil consider the creation of an Action Sheet activity 
within the bilateral U.S.-Brazil safeguards sphere to expand 
on these questions and themes, as well as the possible 
provision of an intern to assist working through these 
issues.  The Brazilian delegation took the suggestions on 
board. 
 
6. (SBU) Beyond the AP and Resende issues, the delegations 
made presentations and discussed respective views on the next 
NPT Review Conference, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the 
Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty, the Convention for the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials, and the Nuclear 
Suppliers Group.  The delegations also briefed on each 
country\'s respective nuclear programs and policies, as well 
as issues regarding the transport of nuclear materials. 
Brazil reviewed the triangular (IAEA, ABACC, and CNEN) system 
of safeguards in place at Brazilian nuclear facilities, and 
answered USDEL questions regarding the extent of IAEA-ABACC 
cooperation.  USDEL in turn described the safeguards system 
in place at U.S nuclear facilities. 
 
7. (C/NF) Given the extensive coverage of specific regional 
non-proliferation concerns during A/S Wolf\'s 4/13 meetings 
with GoB officials, the theme was lightly revisited during 
the JSCNEC.  The Brazilian delegation, however, sought U.S. 
views regarding Iran, with particular emphasis on the degree 
to which Iran\'s statement that it is implementing its AP 
affects USG concerns.  A/S Wolf reiterated that the U.S has 
seen no Iranian statement or action that mitigates these 
concerns, and that we are convinced of the Iranian strategic 
decision to pursue nuclear weapons capabilities.  COMMENT: It 
is clear the Brazilian and U.S perspectives on Iranian 
nuclear intentions remain divergent.  END COMMENT. 
 
8. (C/NF) COMMENT (cont.): A/S Wolf\'s meetings with key GoB 
non-proliferation figures (septel) before the JSCNEC provided 
an opportunity to clear the air and remove any sting 
emanating from the recent media controversy on Brazilian 
nuclear intentions kicked off by an April 4 Washington Post 
article about the Resende facility.  While the Brazilians did 
stick to long-standing policy positions on many issues, their 
willingness to state categorically and on the record that 
there will be an agreement between the GoB and the IAEA 
regarding the Resende enrichment facility before it commences 
operations shows that IAEA pressure on the GoB is working. 
Similarly, the Brazilians\' intense focus during the JSCNEC on 
the USG\'s own implementation plans regarding the Additional 
Protocol is likely an indication that the GoB is carefully 
reviewing its own approach to the issue.

SUBJECT: MEIRELLES:  BRAZIL\'S ECONOMY HAS FUNDAMENTALLY 
CHANGED 
 
REFS: A) Rio de Janeiro 363    B) Brasilia 786 
      C) Brasilia 657          D) Brasilia 613 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  Central Bank President Meirelles, target 
of sustained political attacks over Brazil\'s continued high 
interest rates and unemployment plus popular perceptions 
that the economy is worsening, has unrepentantly asserted 
that Brazil\'s economy not only is growing, but has undergone 
a fundamental positive shift.  For the first time in its 
history, he told the press on April 5, Brazil\'s economy, 
exports and trade surplus are growing at the same time; 
moreover, the Central Bank is now even predicting a slight 
current-account surplus this year, second in a row. 
Meirelles\' thesis is that Brazil\'s maintenance of trade and 
current account surpluses even with the current double-digit 
growth in imports results not just from weak growth and the 
fall in real income but from an evolution in Brazil\'s 
economic structure.  His implication is that Brazil has 
already largely freed itself from its historic external 
financial vulnerability, i.e., the old trade-off between 
domestic growth and external deficits, which has long 
contributed to the stop-and-go nature of growth here.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (U) As Meirelles departed after speaking to an April 5 
Rio de Janeiro Commercial Association lunch (ref A), he 
commented to the press that economic analysts of Brazil were 
missing a major point:  not only has growth returned, but 
Brazil is for the first time simultaneously experiencing GDP 
growth, export growth and trade-surplus growth. 
Traditionally in Brazil, as growth boosted incomes, demand 
for goods, sucked in imports and diverted local products 
from export to domestic markets.  Standard result: 
burgeoning trade and especially current-account deficits. 
This tension between growth and external deficits has been 
at the heart of Brazil\'s stop-and-go growth cycles for 
thirty years.  Its lessening since 2001 amounts to a 
\"fundamental change,\" and it will take a while for everyone 
to perceive it, Meirelles said to the press after his 
speech. 
 
3. (SBU) Assessing Meirelles\' claim is not straightforward. 
Brazil\'s 2003 trade and current account surpluses had a lot 
to do with depressed import demand resulting from weak 
economic growth and depressed real incomes.  Imports in 2002 
and 2003 dropped to $47.2 billion and $48.2 billion, 
respectively, from $55.6 billion in 2001.  Meanwhile, 
exports were surging, spurred by the competitive effect of 
devaluation and by rising commodity prices.  WTO figures 
show Brazil\'s 2003 exports of $73.1 billion moved it up 
modestly in the rankings to become the world\'s 25th largest 
exporter.  An economic advisor in the Ministry of Planning 
has told us that the GoB now is forecasting exports of about 
$85 billion this year (growth of almost 20%), and imports of 
about $61.5 billion (up 27.6%), for a trade balance of 
around $24 billion.  In line with that expectation, the 
first quarter trade surplus, according to the latest 
figures, was $6.17 billion.  A Central Bank director told us 
that, given these trade surplus results, the GoB is now 
predicting a small current account surplus this year, which 
would be Brazil\'s second in a row.  The GoB\'s original 
forecast in late 2003 was for a USD four billion current- 
account deficit. 
 
4. (SBU) For Meirelles to be right about the fundamental 
nature of this shift in Brazil\'s export competitiveness and 
orientation, the surge in exports must be accounted for by 
more than simple devaluation.  Former chief economic advisor 
to the Planning Ministry Jose Carlos Miranda argues that 
productivity increases in Brazilian industry played a 
substantial role in export growth in 2002/2003.  In a March 
23 meeting, Miranda, now head of the Ministry\'s 
international department, told us that investments in 
updated plant and equipment since 2000 had significantly 
increased productivity growth in Brazil\'s industry, 
particularly in machine building.  While it is difficult to 
untangle the competitive effects of devaluation of the Real 
over 2002-2003 from the productivity growth, Miranda argued 
that the continuation of double-digit export growth even 
after the Real\'s revaluation starting in late 2002 points to 
the existence of a structural shift, which he attributes to 
that productivity growth.  The fact that Brazil now is 
exporting tractors to the U.S. and EU exemplifies these 
productivity increases as well as the growing sophistication 
of Brazilian industry, according to Miranda. 
 
5. (SBU) If Meirelles is right that Brazil\'s economy is 
already recovering strongly and will register substantial 
growth in 2004, then the prospect of a simultaneous large 
trade surplus (perhaps even a current-account surplus) 
despite double-digit-import growth this year, would indeed 
seem a potential watershed.  This element in Meirelles\' 
argument is still open to dispute, however.  As pointed out 
in Ref B, various recent data points in this context have 
been inconclusive or negative.  Nor have we yet seen any 
empirical data to quantify the degree to which export 
results since 2001 have been gained by other than favorable 
world-commodity-price and foreign exchange movements. 
 
6.  (SBU) Perhaps the most striking aspect of Meirelles 
argument is the light it sheds on his own and the Central 
Bank\'s apparent beliefs and motives in persisting with the 
Central Bank\'s steady policy of holding the monetary line 
despite the intensified hail of political accusations that 
he is an extreme dogmatist out of touch with the real 
economic world (Refs B, C and D).  But, even if Meirelles 
and Miranda are wrong about Brazil\'s economy already being 
in the process of a fundamental and permanent shift, 
exports\' performance this year should at a minimum be good 
enough to postpone for a while worries about Brazil\'s 
external position. 
 
7. (SBU) In any case, sustaining strong export growth will 
require that Brazil implement the sorts of microeconomic 
reforms that attract significant infrastructure investments, 
particularly to de-bottleneck the ports and transportation 
systems.  And though Brazil\'s exports meanwhile continue to 
benefit from incremental expansions in world markets, its 
dogmatic negotiating stances in the FTAA and WTO Doha Round 
will hobble the kind of structural adjustment Meirelles 
claims is occurring.

TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, PREL, EINV, SOCI, BR, Macroeconomics & Financial 
SUBJECT:  GOB\'S FINANCIAL-MARKET HONEYMOON FINALLY COOLING? 
 
1.  Top front-page story in most national media Friday April 16 
was JP Morgan\'s scaling-back of its recommendation for Brazil 
bonds from overweight to market-weight, and the sharp market 
reaction.  News accounts generally headlined the JPM report\'s 
unease over the direction of GoB fiscal policy, and its 
judgment that the GoB is showing itself to be lax with regard 
to outlays for public-sector workers and pensioners.  The 
report also listed concerns about the GoB\'s putative goal of 
exempting infrastructure investment from future primary-budget 
surplus calculations, as well as about increased potential for 
negative exogenous events such as early U.S. interest-rate 
hikes or a disturbance of China\'s commodity demand. 
 
2.  The JPM analysts see recent developments as threatening 
Brazil\'s long-term debt/GDP trend.  Their report characterized 
January-February fiscal results as below expectations and, 
without openly so stating, insinuated that this year\'s GoB 
budget-surplus target is at risk.  Its summary of the political 
status quo was that \"the government has lost an important 
opportunity to launch a more positive reform agenda...\". 
 
3.  Reaction:  by Thursday evening, Brazil\'s country risk was 
up over 10% to 618, highest since last October (in January 2004 
it briefly dipped below 400.)  The benchmark C-bond was down 
2.6% to 93% of face value.  Commentators quickly pointed out 
the extra difficulty this would mean for the GoB\'s plans to 
raise a further USD 2.5 billion on international markets for 
debt-service needs in 2004.  The BOVESPA likewise dropped over 
2.5%.  The foreign-exchange rate showed greater steadiness. 
The Real closed down by a mere percent, at 2.918 per USD, even 
on a day when USD 5.1 billion in public-debt payment -- by far 
the largest of this year -- fell due, and in the immediate wake 
of the Central Bank\'s latest quarter-point cut of the SELIC 
interest rate last Wednesday (as expected.) 
 
4.  Seemingly surprised as well as stung by these developments, 
Planning Minister Mantega was quickly quoted as disparaging any 
implication that the 4.25% budget-surplus target for 2004 might 
not be met.  Public-sector pay agreements, he stressed, are 
being held in tight, fiscally responsible reins.  Fortuitously, 
Mantega was able to point to just-released first-quarter 
revenue figures including a record collection for March as 
providing more than enough margin to fund public-servant wage 
agreements arrived at to date.  Also by happy coincidence, the 
GoB had just forwarded to Congress both its 2003-2007 
Pluriannual Plan and its budget outline (LDO in Portuguese 
acronym), in which the notion of counter-cyclical budget 
spending has been officially dropped.  (Mantega said counter- 
cyclical novelties at Brazil\'s current juncture would risk 
confusion.)  Both the LDO and the PPA re-confirmed that the 
budget-surplus target for 2005 remains 4.25%. 
 
5.  In the aftermath, various market voices have opined that 
sellers\' nerves were unduly taut and that the JP Morgan report 
contained little news and was overblown.  True, a day later 
Citibank also lowered its Brazil-bond recommendation, and 
Merrill Lynch issued a more general recommendation to move 
assets from Brazilian stocks towards Mexican instruments. 
Citibank\'s well-known analyst, however, attributed his shift 
purely to external considerations, explicitly asserting that he 
had no reservations about GoB policies.  Meanwhile, other banks 
(ABN Amro, West LB) reaffirmed their strong Brazilian \"buy.\" 
 
6.  The JP Morgan report came in for relaxed roasting at the 
April 16 blue-ribbon Businessmen\'s Seminar in Bahia, attended 
inter alia by former president Cardoso as well as Finance 
Minister Palocci.  Comments ran along the lines that the report 
must have been composed by a junior analyst who got out of bed 
in a bad mood.  In the process, Palocci went out of his way to 
be quoted admitting that his policies have been a continuation 
of FHC\'s, and that he is proudly ready to continue doing so for 
ten years more.  Friday April 16 market results walked back 
much of Thursday\'s damage. 
 
7.  NOTE:  The episode seems to be an amusing case of 
\"rational\" markets\' logic.  In descending from \"over-market\" to 
\"market-weight\" (i.e., 23% of the world emerging-market index, 
reportedly) for its Brazil-bond recommendation, JPM was 
literally just endorsing the general market assessment of 
Brazil bonds\' profitability, in place of its previous second- 
guessing of the general market assessment.  But its very 
endorsement caused that assessment to adjust itself downwards. 
END NOTE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8.  This episode does have its frivolous aspect.  Not least, 
JPM raised its recommendation to \"above-market\" just six weeks 
ago, on the premise that damage to the GoB from the Dirceu 
scandal had been exaggerated.  Yet the more sober view of 
Brazil\'s longer-term prospects meshes with opinions we heard 
from the chief economist of another top Brazil-based U.S. bank 
in Sao Paulo last month.  After a protracted honeymoon during 
which, in our assessment, an eager market made more of Lula\'s 
first-year reforms and policy than the latter\'s material 
benefits objectively warranted, are we at an inflection point 
in the market\'s rosy-tinted view of Brazilian Treasuries?  The 
big profits have already been made, and the benign external 
environment may indeed be due for a change of weather.  Many 
would agree the GoB has failed to make the most of its first 
year in terms of reforms, and there is less and less trust that 
first-quarter GDP data will be reassuring when released in May. 
 
9.  Where we, and apparently most of the rest of the market 
players, see the JP Morgan report as dead wrong is its notion 
that the GoB is starting to fall off the fiscal-control wagon. 
For us, Lula and his team have demonstrated by any reasonable 
criteria that the opposite is true, even as pressure for fiscal 
relaxation has swollen across Brazil\'s socio-political 
spectrum.  The various new GoB programs for housing, industrial 
stimulus, land-reform, etc. that have admittedly been announced 
of late, when examined, prove to be reasonably circumscribed in 
fiscal practice.  (Septel on \"Brazil\'s 2004 Budget Blues\".) 
Lula\'s latest litmus test in this sphere will be the GoB 
decision, due any day now, over this year\'s increase in the 
minimum wage (Septel.)

SUBJECT:  LULA\'S NEXT FISCAL LITMUS TEST:  2004\'S MINIMUM-WAGE 
HIKE 
 
 
1.  The annual adjustment of Brazil\'s official minimum wage 
takes effect May 1, meaning the GoB usually announces the new 
number by mid-April.  A \'strawman\' figure is always included, 
and funds programmed accordingly, in the GoB\'s initial budget 
presentation to Congress the preceding August, but that figure 
has not been taken as a serious indicator of the final official 
one in recent years.  Lula\'s Worker\'s Party always attacked 
previous GoBs for keeping the minimum wage too low.  Lula 
during his 2002 presidential campaign proclaimed he would 
double it in real terms by 2007.  Last year, his first in 
office, he raised it 20% in nominal terms to 240 Reals per 
month. 
 
2.  The GoB\'s preliminary number for 2004 was a 7.9% nominal 
raise, to 259 Reals.  The August 2003 draft budget duly set 
aside about two billion Reals to cover that amount.  But the 
common expectation has come to be that the GoB will announce 
something between 270 and 280.  That would reportedly require 
extra budget outlays of two to three billion Reals.  This being 
Brazil\'s local-election year, with some 5,600 mayoral and 
60,000 town-counselor races, various voices, especially in 
Congress -- largely oppositionists, rather than from Lula\'s 
leftist coalition -- are agitating for upwards of 300 Reals. 
 
3.  For President Lula, the crux is fiscal, not political.  In 
Brazil, the minimum wage is overwhelmingly a public-sector 
budget issue rather than a private-sector business concern. 
Minimum-wage workers themselves are a relatively trivial 
factor.  Reportedly no more than a few hundred thousand public- 
sector employees work for minimum wage.  (An estimated six 
million maids, gardeners and other domestic informal workers 
do, according to the official IBGE estimate.)  However, the 
latter is the basis for extensive other government expenses. 
Of Brazil\'s 22 million INSS (Social-Security equivalent) 
private-sector retirees, for example, 15 million get a minimum- 
wage pension.  Thus, a relatively less-skinflint hike would hit 
INSS very hard, in a year when the INSS deficit is already 
increasing so fast that it has for the first time overtaken 
that of Brazil\'s public-sector pension system -- an infamous 
fiscal crater. 
 
4.  Overall, CSFB calculates that each one-Real hike in the 
wage means an extra Reals 141 million from the GoB budget for 
the balance of 2004 starting May 1.  An April 16 \'Estado de Sao 
Paulo\' column reported that each one-percent hike over the 259 
Real figure will translate to 438 million Reals a year extra 
expenditure by the government. 
 
5.  Commentators highlight the particular plight of Brazil\'s 
smaller municipalities in this respect.  Especially in the 
impoverished Northeast, their budgets, with puny and sometimes 
shrinking revenues, have a far higher proportion of minimum- 
wage-linked expenditures.  It is claimed that lifting the 
minimum wage even to 270 Reals would force at least a thousand 
of Brazil\'s mayors into the dilemma of either not making 
constitutionally mandated outlays or violating the May 2000 
federal Law of Fiscal Responsibility. 
 
6.  The GoB announcement of its minimum-wage decision, expected 
on April 15, was postponed without explanation.  Inter alia, 
the GoB is reportedly seeking creative devices by which to 
supplement payments to minimum-wage-income families, such as 
via an existing social program dating back to 1963 (\"salario- 
familia\") which would make payments for children under fourteen 
to the tune of 13 Reals per eligible child.  This would 
modestly increase such minimum-income-families\' buying power 
without boosting the official minimum wage, thus avoiding 
follow-on costs for INSS and other linked government 
expenditures. 
 
7.  Lula has already admitted that the wage\'s doubling in real 
terms by 2007 does not look feasible.  In this fiscal-policy 
sphere, too, even his critics are giving him credit for casting 
away old PT ideology and rhetoric and responsibly weighing the 
consequences for Brazil\'s public budget.

SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN INDIANS KILL 29 PROSPECTORS 
 
REF: BRASILIA 0682 
 
Classified By: POLOFF RICHARD REITER, FOR REASONS 1.4B AND D. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  On April 7, some 29 diamond prospectors 
working illegally on an Indian reservation in the western 
Brazilian state of Rondonia were slain by members of the 
Cinta-Larga tribe.  Three bodies were found on April 11 and 
another twenty-six on April 16.  Authorities now fear 
reprisals against Indians, some of whom have been assaulted 
in a nearby town.  The situation remains tense and a police 
investigation is underway.  Since reports of the massacre 
began to trickle in, conflicting stories have emerged about 
the motive for the killings.  Indian leaders and officials of 
the GoB\'s indian agency, FUNAI, say the Indians were 
defending their land against a long-running invasion by 
illegal miners.  But some police officials say that several 
Indian leaders are involved in diamond trafficking, and that 
the murders were a show of force against those who failed to 
give them their share.  In response to the massacre, the 
government plans another police sweep of the Rondonia 
reservation as well as a new law to facilitate legal 
concessions of mineral rights on Indian lands.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DOZENS DEAD ON ROOSEVELT RESERVATION 
------------------------------------ 
2. (SBU) On April 7, at least twenty-nine diamond prospectors 
were killed in the dense jungle of the western Brazilian 
state of Rondonia.  The massacre occurred on the Roosevelt 
Indian reservation (named for a nearby river that was first 
mapped by Theodore Roosevelt in 1914).  The reservation 
includes four areas comprising 2.7 million hectares (the size 
of Massachusetts) and is home to six Indian tribes, of which 
the 1,500-member Cinta-Larga (\"Broad Sash\") is the largest. 
Three corpses were found at one site on April 4.  On April 
16, authorities responding to reports from prospectors and 
led by local Indians found approximately 26 more bodies at a 
separate site.  The bodies were hacked to pieces and 
decomposed, making it difficult to assess how many were 
killed or to identify the dead.  Given the rugged terrain and 
the isolated nature of mining, more bodies may yet be 
discovered.  Gilton Muniz, of the Prospectors\' Union, says 
another twelve prospectors remain missing, and state Governor 
Ivo Cassol told the press on April 17, \"Unfortunately, many 
more bodies will be found.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Cinta-Larga leader Oita Matina announced that the 
attack was carried out by his tribe\'s warriors in response to 
an ongoing invasion by diamond hunters that began in 1999. 
Mercio Pereira, President of FUNAI (\"National Indian 
Foundation\" --the GoB\'s Indian agency) concurred, noting, \"We 
are very sorry for those who died, but we must also say that 
the Indians are defending their lands.  The prospectors are 
completely illegal.\"  Pereira\'s statement exacerbated 
tensions between his agency and the state government, as 
Governor Cassol wondered rhetorically if Pereira would 
encourage landowners whose farms are occupied by the Landless 
Movement (MST) to respond with violence. 
 
DIAMOND TRADE FUELS VIOLENCE 
---------------------------- 
4. (C) The discovery of South America\'s richest diamond 
deposits (estimated at US$2 billion) on the Roosevelt 
reservation ignited a rush of prospectors to the area in 
1999.  By law, commercial mining on Indian lands is 
prohibited, unless specifically authorized by Congress. 
FUNAI\'s Pereira says that his agency, along with the Federal 
Police, have conducted four sweeps to remove illegal 
prospectors from the reservation, including one in January 
when 4,500 prospectors were removed, but many later returned. 
 The lawless nature of the region and the huge sums at stake 
have fed a culture of violence:  the Civil Police chief in 
the nearby town of Espigao do Oeste says that from 1999 to 
2003, at least thirty prospectors\' bodies were found on the 
Roosevelt reservation, though it is not clear how many died 
in conflicts with Indians or with other prospectors.  In 
November 2003, four prospectors were killed in one incident, 
and an injured survivor charged that a FUNAI official, whom 
he alleged was involved in diamond trafficking, was among the 
assailants.  FUNAI President Pereira insisted to us that the 
charges were investigated and found baseless. 
SOME INDIAN LEADERS MAY BE DIAMOND SMUGGLERS 
-------------------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) In a recent interview, regional Federal Police 
commander Marco Aurelio Moura said his office has refocused 
its efforts away from the Roosevelt reservation, \"We don\'t 
have enough people to interfere with the prospectors\' 
activities, and now we have information that the Indians 
themselves are involved in diamond trafficking, so we have 
changed our strategy to investigate those who buy the gems.\" 
By going after smugglers rather than prospectors, the Federal 
Police have made 30 arrests in Rondonia this year, including 
of Marcos Glika, reportedly one of Brazil\'s most important 
gem traffickers.  Press reporting dating to 2001 describes 
how some tribal leaders suddenly became rich while most of 
the tribe lived in misery, and also alleged that some FUNAI 
officials may be implicated in the diamond trade. 
 
6. (C) These reports, which the Federal Police\'s National 
Coordinator for Special Border Operations, Mauro Sposito, 
told us were generally accurate, indicate that soon after the 
diamond rush began in 1999, some Cinta-Larga began charging 
fees to the prospectors: a reported R$10,000 (about US$3,300) 
per head plus up to 50% of profits.  This suggests that the 
April 7 massacre was more complicated than the initial 
reporting indicated.  As thousands of prospectors surged into 
the area --and formed unions that pressured the government 
for commercial rights-- the Indians began to lose control of 
their profit-sharing system.  Some Federal Police have told 
the press that there is no broad conflict between the 
Cinta-Larga and the prospectors, but that the killings are a 
\"settling of scores\": killing those who failed to pay their 
fees. 
 
SITUATION: \"A POWDER KEG\" 
------------------------- 
7. (SBU) The massacre has left the region a \"powder keg\", 
according to Federal Police commander Moura.  As reports 
brought by prospectors trickled in, Indians in the area have 
been assaulted by furious townspeople and miners.  One Indian 
was terrorized by 300 people on the central square of the 
town of Espigao do Oeste, only to be freed after hours of 
negotiations by local officials.  Military Police commander 
Firmino Aparecido told the press that most of the 100 
Cinta-Larga who live in the town have now fled.  Prospectors\' 
Union leader Muniz says that the climate is tense, \"The 
prospectors are upset and want to react.  The prospectors 
were surprised by the Indians, who showed up shooting.  We 
just want to work and have the right to extract the 
minerals\".  Muniz estimates there are 7,000 prospectors in 
Rondonia, about 1,000 of whom are on the Roosevelt 
reservation. 
 
STATE OF THE INVESTIGATION 
-------------------------- 
8. (C) Federal Police Coordinator Sposito told us on April 18 
that the remains were still being removed by helicopter to 
the state capital of Porto Velho for autopsies and 
identification and that the operation could take a few more 
days.  Fifty Federal Police agents, together with FUNAI 
officials, are investigating the massacre.  Sposito noted 
that while the Cinta-Larga tribe has taken responsibility, 
the investigation will look for the individuals involved 
--and that the police have a \"good idea\" who they were. 
FUNAI President Mercio Pereira told us he was alarmed that 
the government was pointing the finger at the Cinta-Larga and 
looking for an easy scapegoat.  In the meantime, federal 
officials are planning another operation to remove 
prospectors still on the reservation, and uniformed police 
are on alert to prevent an escalation of violence. 
 
COMMENT - SLOW PROGRESS ON INDIAN AFFAIRS 
----------------------------------------- 
9. (C) In the short-run, the GoB response to the Rondonia 
massacre consists of the police investigation, followed by 
what Justice Minister Bastos announced on April 18 will be an 
operation of \"general disarmament\" to try to discourage 
further bloodshed.  200 Federal Police and FUNAI officers 
will initiate the operation as soon as they have finished 
recovering the remains of the 26 murdered prospectors.  This 
operation may be lashed together with the previously 
scheduled \"Operation Rondonia\" (reftel).  Medium-term, the 
government is drafting a law to regulate mineral rights on 
reservations in order to provide Indians with legal means to 
extract and sell diamonds without resorting to the black 
market.  FUNAI President Pereira told us the bill is now in 
an inter-ministerial committee, and he hopes it will go to 
Congress before the July recess.  Further, the Ministry of 
Mines and Energy is studying the possibility of making 
available to prospectors some mining concessions located 
outside of the reservation. 
 
10. (C) Longer term, the Lula government has been slow to 
take the initiative on indigenous issues.  It has not put 
forward a comprehensive national plan and is trying to 
resolve several simultaneous disputes, most of which concern 
demarcation of new reservations.  Last week President Lula 
presided over a contentious cabinet meeting to debate the 
long-running case of the Raposa Serra do Sul reservation in 
the northern state of Roraima (septel) that still awaits 
demarcation; a decision was put off until April 27.

1. (U) This is Part II of a three-part series about Indians 
in Brazil.  This cable reviews the concerns of indigenous 
leaders.  Part I provides an overview and Part III discusses 
ongoing land disputes. 
 
2. (C) Summary. During the 2002 presidential campaign Lula 
spoke about Indian rights and promised to demarcate and 
register Indian lands quickly.  As a result, Indian leaders 
and indigenous rights activists were optimistic that many of 
the longstanding grievances of Brazil\'s Indians would finally 
become a GoB priority.  However, numerous Indian leaders feel 
that since Lula took office, he has not paid sufficient 
attention to their issues.  Many express disappointment and 
even a sense of betrayal.  The growing Indian disputes of the 
last few months, during which time Indians have clashed with 
farmers and prospectors, in some cases violently, in several 
states, has served to strengthen these impressions.  The 
president of the GoB\'s Indian affairs agency defends the 
government\'s record but acknowledgs that Lula has not 
completely lived up to expectations.  End summary. 
 
Indian Government Officials Criticize Lula 
------------------------------------------ 
3. (C) Antonio Apurina, Director of Assistance Programs for 
FUNAI (the GoB\'s Indian agency) and the only Indian in a 
senior position anywhere in the GoB, harshly criticized 
President Lula during a February meeting with Poloff. 
Apurina, a chief of the Apurina tribe and an \"alternate\" 
senator for the state of Acre, and Jose da Silva-Jaminawa 
Tunoma, a chief of the Jaminawa Indians and FUNAI\'s Chief of 
Station in Acre, told us the Lula government has not 
developed a policy to address the problems of Indians in 
Brazil. 
 
4. (C) Apurina said he was \"not impressed\" with his boss, 
Mercio Pereira, President of FUNAI.  Despite Pereira\'s 
background as an anthropologist and specialist in Indian 
affairs, Apurina accused him of patronizing Indians and said 
he and Lula are not genuinely interested in dialogue with 
Indian leaders.  He said Indians were disappointed that Lula 
chose not to appoint the first Indian president of FUNAI and 
emphasized that he himself is the only Indian senior FUNAI 
official --criticizing the fact that an Indian had not been 
placed in charge of Land Issues Directorate, the most 
powerful of FUNAI\'s directorates.  Apurina said the Lula 
government has not developed a plan for economic development 
on reservations and criticized IBAMA, Brazil\'s environmental 
protection agency, for contributing to underdevelopment by 
trying to maintain Indian reservations as de facto nature 
preserves. 
 
5. (C) Apurina said that earlier this year he and several 
other Indian leaders were invited to speak with Cesar 
Alvares, Undersecretary General of the Presidency, about the 
developing Indian crisis, but Apurina said Indian leaders are 
\"sick of talking.\"  Moreover, he was critical of the fact 
that none of the ministries responsible for improving the 
conditions of Indians in Brazil (e.g., Justice, Education, 
Labor, Health, etc.) attended the meeting.  The Indians 
raised a series of concerns with Alvares, who was unable to 
make any commitments in response.  As a result, several of 
the Indian leaders thought \"the meeting was useless,\" 
according to Apurina. 
 
Lula - \"Disappointment\" for Indian Rights NGOs 
--------------------------------------------- - 
6. (SBU) Andre Lima, head of the Brazilian NGO \"Instituto 
Socio-Ambiental\", which advocates for protection of the 
environmental and Indian rights, told Poloff that the Lula 
government has been a \"great disappointment.\"  And Jose Eden 
Pereira Magalhaes, head of the Indigenous Missionary Council 
(CIMI), a Catholic NGO that advocates for Indian rights, told 
us (unlike Apurina, above, who is \"sick of talking\") that the 
\"government does not speak with the Indians.\" 
 
7. (SBU) All four interlocutors commented on the GOB\'s 
unnecessary and politically motivated delays in registering 
indigenous lands.  They feel that Lula\'s quest for a 
congressional majority has made him unwilling to antagonize 
powerful politicians from states with significant Indian 
populations by finalizing the demarcation process.  These 
politicians are beholden to major landowners (or are 
landowners themselves).  Lula, they say, is the first 
Brazilian president since the 1988 Constitution to reduce the 
size of an indigenous territory surveyed and demarcated by 
FUNAI. 
 
Ending the Government\'s Guardianship of Indians 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
8. (SBU) These interlocutors also opined that the GOB\'s 
Indian problem goes deeper than the question of land.  The 
greater issue is respect for Indians.  They explained that 
the lack of respect is the legacy of a patronizing system of 
\"tutela\" --government guardianship-- of Indians that existed 
before the 1988 Constitution and, in certain respects, still 
exists today.  Despite the Constitution, much of the old 
legislation --which essentially treats Indians as wards of 
the state-- remains in force, according to Lima. 
 
FUNAI President Sympathetic But Defends Government 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
9.  (C) On March 12, Poloff met with Mercio Pereira, 
president of FUNAI, to discuss the criticisms by the Indian 
leaders and NGOs.  When asked if their assessment was fair, 
Mendes replied, \"It\'s fair, but it\'s not fair,\" acknowledging 
that Lula had greatly raised expectations and has not lived 
up to them.  However, he emphasized, \"this government is 
doing as much, if not more than the previous government.\" 
 
10.  (C) Pereira rejected criticism of Lula for not 
appointing an Indian as president of FUNAI.  \"Which tribe 
would you chose from?  There are more than 200 tribes,\" he 
said, adding that, \"If Lula had picked an Indian as president 
of FUNAI, there easily could have been violence between 
Indian tribes.\"  While acknowledging the final registration 
of the controversial Raposa/Serra do Sol in Roraima state 
(see Part III of this series) has been delayed for \"political 
reasons,\" Gomes said the Lula government has finished the 
demarcation process for all the other territories that were 
pending when Lula came to office and has moved forward on new 
demarcations.  Asked if the Lula government would fulfill its 
promise of finishing the demarcation process in four years, 
Gomes said, \"I was optimistic before.  Now, I don\'t know. 
The government is fragile now because of scandals.  It will 
probably take two terms to completely demarcate and register 
the final 30 percent.\" 
 
11.  (C) Comment.  Some Indian leaders and indigenous rights 
activists feel betrayed by Lula and the PT.  They expected 
this government to be more aggressive on their issues and are 
disappointed with progress so far.  While Indians make up 
less than one percent of Brazil\'s population, they hold 
powerful symbolic value in Brazilian culture and society. 
Being accused of being insensitive to their concerns is not 
an enviable position for President Lula.

1. (C) Summary.  With introduction of the Friends of Haiti 
draft resolution to the UNSC for discussion and a probable 
vote this week, Brazil is at an important stage in its 
planning to deploy a PKO mission.  Major issues on the scope 
now are internal political dynamics, congress\' role and 
operational planning. Once the UN resolution passes, the 
executive plan for the deployment should move quickly to 
congress, where the GOB\'s solid majority and historic 
precedent suggest relatively quick approval, despite the 
possibility of some debate.  Budget issues are looming large 
as a prime area of concern.  The GOB also needs to speed up 
its sluggish military operational planning, including 
committing to send representatives to UN military 
coordination meetings and offering greater clarity on what 
equipment and support their forces may need from us.  End 
summary. 
 
MRE AND UN STATUS 
 
2. (C) PolCouns discussed ref a demarche points and Haiti 
developments with Foreign Ministry UN Division Chief Carlos 
Duarte on 20 and again on 23 April.  Duarte said that 
Brazil\'s delegation in New York has been working with the 
U.S. and other Friends (Canada, France, Chile) to craft a 
resolution text that will help facilitate Brazil\'s 
deployment, even if the resolution\'s mandate is under Chapter 
VII.  Duarte also said that, following release of the UN 
assessment team\'s report on 20 April, Brazil\'s New York 
delegation had been approached \"on an urgent basis\" by the UN 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UNDPKO), requesting 
details asap on Brazil\'s contribution and urging closer 
liaison with the UNDPKO. 
 
PRESIDENCY 
 
3. (C) Marcel Biato (protect), President Lula da Silva\'s 
deputy foreign affairs advisor, confirmed to PolCouns on 26 
April that the joint MRE-MOD message detailing Brazil\'s 
deployment plan is on Lula\'s desk. Biato opined that Lula 
would sign off on the deployment plan and move it quickly to 
congress when the resolution passes.  That said, Biato 
indicated that budget questions are looming large in 
Planalto\'s consideration of the deployment and likely would 
be a focal point of any debates within the executive branch, 
congress or the press.  Biato said that the GOB is estimating 
a cost of about USD 50 million for the deployment.  He 
pointed out that is roughly the amount of funding Lula may 
release on an emergency basis to Brazilian states for 
spending on public security -- a hot issue in the wake of a 
recent explosion of organized criminal violence in Rio de 
Janeiro.  (Note: Although the UN reimburses on most costs of 
the PKO, the lag between disbursal of funds by the GOB and 
reimbursement affects budget decisions in the near term. End 
note.) 
 
4. (C) PolCouns noted to Biato a recent speech by Lula in 
which the president insisted that Brazil\'s PKO contribution 
be viewed as part of a broad international commitment to 
social and economic development in Haiti.  Biato replied that 
Lula\'s support for the deployment remains robust.  However, 
along with concerns noted above about costs and priorities, 
the GOB may have to deal with other domestic criticisms of 
the deployment, including questions about Aristide\'s 
departure and leftist charges (including from within Lula\'s 
PT party) that the deployment will bolster American 
\"hegemony.\"  Biato said Lula needs to show the PKO fits in 
with the GOB\'s vision of global social development, and Biato 
said that language in the current Friends of Haiti resolution 
draft should help with that concern. 
 
CONGRESS\' ROLE 
 
5. (C) Under widely-accepted interpretations of Brazil\'s 1988 
Constitution, the congress must approve the overseas 
deployment of Brazilian military forces.  The MRE-MOD joint 
message, once signed off by Lula, will be sent to the 
Congress in the form of an \"explanation of motives\" 
(\"explicacao dos motivos\").  A budget request for the plan is 
included.  The executive branch measure goes first to the 
lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, where the Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee will assign a sponsor 
(\"relator\") who redrafts the executive document into a bill 
(\"projeto do lei\").  The Foreign Affairs Committee considers 
and votes the bill out to the plenary for approval, and that 
secured, the bill moves to the Senate.  Following examination 
by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, there is a Senate 
plenary vote.  In this case, the bill will almost certainly 
be placed on the congress\' \"urgent\" track, where it can 
by-pass other legislation, and the entire congressional 
process can be completed in a matter of several days, if 
debate does not stall progress. 
 
6. (C) Senator Eduardo Suplicy, chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Affairs Committee, told poloff last week that 
Brazil\'s congress had never rejected an executive branch 
proposal for overseas deployment of Brazilian forces. 
Indeed, while the budget questions and some of the domestic 
criticisms noted above may well surface in Brazil\'s congress, 
the government\'s solid majority in both houses and historic 
precedent strongly suggest the measure will pass, and 
relatively quickly. 
 
MOD - SLUGGISH OPERATIONAL PLANNING 
7. (C) The factors above point to a window of one to two 
weeks from the time the UN resolution passes until the GOB 
gives the final go-ahead for a deployment.  However, it is 
not clear that Brazilian military planning is moving ahead in 
a manner that would will facilitate rapid deployment once the 
political order is given. Repeated Mission MLO Chief queries 
in the past several days to Brazilian military planners 
suggest the military establishment is moving at a sluggish 
pace.  Brazilian military sources told MLO chief that only 
after a resolution is passed and Brazil\'s congress approves a 
deployment will the military commit to sending 
representatives to UNDPKO operational planning meetings (such 
as the one scheduled for Haiti on 2-7 May.)  In addition, 
despite Defense Minister Viegas\' request for support and 
transfer of U.S. equipment to Brazilian forces that deploy to 
Haiti (ref B), Brazilian liaison officers have yet to 
indicate when or if the GOB will sign an ACSA agreement to 
facilitate U.S. logistical support to Brazilian forces, and 
the MOD has not yet provided a list of specific requirements 
for equipment. 
 
8. (C) In one effort to accelerate progress, SOUTHCOM J-4 and 
Brazilian liaison have compiled (on 26 April) a working list 
of equipment that Brazilian forces may require in Haiti, for 
DOD to determine whether the items can be made available for 
purchase to Brazil.  (Note: Brazil army contacts indicate to 
MLO chief that Brazil has USD 400 thousand available in an 
FMS account. End note.)  DOD and SOUTHCOM are also pursuing 
information on availability of equipment from the UN. 
Mission DAO is also providing situation reports to the MOD, 
and has offered secure communication equipment for 
intelligence sharing. 
 
9. (C) Comment. Possible debate about the budget issue and an 
evident lack of speed in  military planning appear to be the 
main challenges in the weeks ahead to deployment of Brazilian 
forces to Haiti.  While these are obstacles, the continued 
commitment of the GOB to the operation, the political force 
the Lula government enjoys in congress and a certain native 
Brazilian talent for pulling complex projects together in 
competent fashion at the last minute suggest DefMin Viegas\' 
timeline of a late June deployment for the bulk of forces 
(ref C) is possible and likely.  Nonetheless, we should 
continue to encourage the GOB to participate in crucial 
military planning now, to sign an ACSA agreement to 
facilitate operational support, and we should be proactive in 
identifying equipment that could be transferred to Brazilian 
units in Haiti.

VIOLENCE 
 
REF: A. BRASILIA 0941 
 
     B. BRASILIA 0946 
     C. BRASILIA 0985 
 
1. (U) This is Part III of a three-part series about Indians 
in Brazil.  This cable discusses current land disputes.  Part 
I (ref B) provided an overview and Part II (ref C) discussed 
concerns of indigenous leaders. 
 
2. (U) Summary.  The government of Brazil is facing 
unhappiness among indigenous communities who are demanding 
that the land demarcation process be sped up.  The Indians\' 
land claims are often in conflict with farmers\' interests 
and, in some cases, the GOB would have to expropriate land to 
which farmers have title.  In the northern state of Roraima, 
the governor has opposed the creation of large reservation 
that would displace rice farmers.  The governor, who briefly 
joined President Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) last year, has 
urged Lula to reject the Indian affairs agency (FUNAI) 
proposal and called instead for the creation of an 
\"archipelago\" of reservations that would permit farmers to 
have continued access to land they currently cultivate. 
Indian leaders and activist argue that the \"archipelago\" 
reservation would condemn the Indians to poverty and leave 
them vulnerable to invasions by prospectors, hunters, and 
farmers.  In Mato Grosso do Sul state several indigenous 
communities have adopted the Landless Movement\'s (MST) 
occupation tactics in an effort to force the GOB to cede land 
to them.  End summary. 
 
Governor Fights Contiguous Indian Reservation 
--------------------------------------------- 
3. (U) One of the most controversial indigenous land disputes 
in Brazil is in the northern state of Roraima, where state 
political leaders, 67 non-Indian farmers, a handful of 
Indians, and some military officers have opposed the 
demarcation of a 1,750,000 hectare (eight percent of the 
state\'s total land area) reservation for 14,000 Indians along 
the border with Venezuela and Guyana.  Rice planters, whose 
production accounts for 10 percent of the state\'s economy, 
oppose the creation of the \"Raposa Serra do Sol\" reservation 
in a contiguous configuration, because that would require 
them to vacate much of the farmland they currently have under 
cultivation. 
 
4. (U) The farmers, Roraima Governor Flamarion Portela, and 
the state\'s federal Senators are instead proposing to break 
the reservation up into \"islands\" to allow for expanded 
state-directed economic development.  Portela has complained 
bitterly about governing a \"virtual state,\" because the GoB 
--either through FUNAI or the environmental protection agency 
IBAMA-- controls more than half of the state\'s land.  In 
March 2003, Portela switched to Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) 
allegedly after getting a GoB commitment to the archipelago 
configuration.  In December, Portela was asked to leave the 
PT to defend himself against charges of massive corruption. 
He is now \"without party\". 
 
5. (U) In 1999, opponents of the contiguous reservation plan 
sued to stop the demarcation process.  In March 2004, a 
federal judge in Roraima ruled in their favor and placed an 
injunction against the creation of the reservation.  The 
ruling does not, however, prevent the immediate registration 
of the reservation as a whole.  The Solicitor General, the 
Ministry of Justice, FUNAI, and a federal prosecutor in 
Roraima have all announced they will appeal the decision. 
 
Defense Minister Questions Reservations Along the Border 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
6. (U) Defense Minister Viegas has his own reasons to oppose 
the reservation.  He argues that the federal government needs 
access to the international border, which he believes would 
be threatened by the creation of the Roraima reservation.  In 
congressional testimony on March 4, Viegas warned against an 
\"overly broad interpretation of indigenous land, above all in 
the border regions,\" which \"could pave the way for future 
demands for the establishment of \'indigenous nations\' with a 
legal structure different\" from the rest of Brazil.  He 
concluded, \"I adamantly oppose this concept\".  Viegas said 
the armed forces need to \"revitalize\" their presence on the 
northern border, which \"is not adequately occupied, 
demographically or productively\" because of Indian 
reservations and nature preserves and that this \"reduces the 
State\'s own capacity\" to fight transnational and 
environmental crimes.  He also argued that the reservations 
and environmental preserves make it difficult to build 
infrastructure projects that would permit greater 
development. 
 
Justice Minister and FUNAI Chief Defend Reservation 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
7. (U) On March 3, Minister of Justice Marcio Thomaz Bastos 
guaranteed in a Senate hearing that the contiguous 
demarcation of the Raposa Serra do Sol reservation would be 
finalized.  At the same hearing, responding to critical 
comments from Senators from Roraima, Amazonas, and Mato 
Grosso do Sul states, FUNAI President Mercio Pereira was 
dismissive of arguments that the various Indian groups might 
fight among themselves if placed on one large reservation, 
rather than several smaller ones.  He cited an example where 
twelve different languages are spoken in one reservation, 
saying the reservation in that contiguous form, \"only brought 
benefits.\" 
 
NGOs call National Security A \"False Controversy\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
8. (SBU) According to Andre Lima, head of the Brazilian NGO 
\"Instituto Socio-Ambiental\", which advocates for 
environmental and Indian rights, \"It is a false controversy.\" 
 He notes that the rice farmers arrived after the land had 
already been demarcated by FUNAI.  (In 1970 only 41,000 
non-Indians lived in the state.  Today, largely as a result 
of government incentives, the population has grown to 
360,000.)  Therefore, the farmers cannot be considered to 
have entered the land in \"good faith\" and have no 
constitutional rights to it.  Indian interlocutors accuse the 
state government of establishing a small town and several 
small villages in the middle of the reservation and providing 
government jobs to some Indians to prevent the federal 
government from registering the territory. 
 
9. (SBU) With respect to DefMin Viegas\' national security 
argument, Lima noted that the Constitution guarantees the 
federal government access to Indian lands.  Indeed, former 
President Cardoso issued an executive decree in 2002 spelling 
out the right of the military and police to access Indian 
lands.  In fact, a number of army units are based on Indian 
reservations today.  Moreover, there already exist large 
demarcated indigenous territories along the border with Peru, 
where the \"military access\" argument has never been a 
concern.  According to Antonio da Silva Apurina, Director of 
Assistance Programs for FUNAI, the real obstacles to 
demarcating the Roraima reservation are \"economic and 
political interests.\" 
 
Mato Grosso do Sul Land Occupations 
------------------------------------ 
10. (U) In late 2003 and early 2004, approximately 4,000 
Caiovas-Guarani Indians occupied several farms in the 
southern state of Mato Grosso do Sul for months, arguing that 
the land historically belongs to them.  They ultimately 
complied with a judicial order to vacate the land.  During 
the tense stand-off, a farmer, his wife, and their 
daughter-in-law were briefly taken hostage by the Indians, 
and one Indian was wounded by gunfire. 
 
11. (SBU) The Indian land occupations in Mato Grosso do Sul 
are more complicated than the Roraima situation, according to 
Lima.  The farmers have been on the land for several 
generations and have land titles issued by the state (in many 
cases improperly) and so many could be considered to have 
occupied the land \"in good faith\", meaning they are entitled 
to compensation for improvements made to the land.  The 
government does not have the resources to compensate them and 
is therefore unable to evict them. 
 
12. (SBU) The Mato Grosso do Sul occupations were the result 
of Indian impatience with the official process and an attempt 
to borrow the tactics of the Landless Movement (MST). 
Guarani tribal leaders say they are facing a suicide epidemic 
because they have been forced to live on small reservations 
that prevent them from following traditional customs or 
economic development.  FUNAI President Pereira told Poloff 
that he is sympathetic to the Indians, but acknowledged that 
it will be impossible to turn back the clock and give them a 
significant portion of their lands back.  The region\'s 
booming soy economy makes such an outcome all but impossible, 
he said. 
 
Indians and Farmers Use Violence in Land Disputes 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
13. (U) While the Roraima and Mato Grosso do Sul cases are on 
the front pages, they are not the only cases of Indian 
disputes in Brazil: 
 
- On January 12, thirty Pankararu Indians invaded the FUNAI 
headquarters in Recife in the northeast to protest the 
dismissal of an agency director.  Three Indians were arrested. 
 
- In January, more than 100 Guajajara Indians blocked a 
highway in Maranhao in the northeast to protest what they see 
as encroachment on their land.  State military police were 
called in to break up the demonstration. 
 
- On February 16, a farmer was shot and killed and six others 
taken hostage by a group of 200 Caingangues Indians in the 
southern state of Santa Catarina, as a result of tension over 
land distribution.  The Indians are demanding that their 
reservation be expanded.  FUNAI supports their demand, but 
the Indians are impatient with delays. 
 
- On February 24, prospectors in Roraima shot and killed an 
Indian who worked for FUNAI and was investigating illegal 
invasions of Yanomami Indian land in the northeast part of 
the state.  An investigation is ongoing. 
 
-- On April 7, twenty-nine illegal diamond prospectors were 
massacred on an Indian reservation in Rondonia state (ref A). 
 
Comment 
------- 
14. (SBU) President Lula faces a growing Indian affairs 
policy dilemma.  Despite several cabinet meetings addressing 
the Roraima reservation issue, he has put off a decision at 
least until late April.  As in other policy spheres, he faces 
severely conflicting pressures.  While agribusiness and 
political allies want to reduce the size of some reservations 
proposed by FUNAI, Indian leaders and activists want faster 
action to finish the demarcation process.  The Rondonia 
massacre and Roraima demarcation may now force him to show 
his hand and take a firm stand.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S TREATMENT OF SODA ASH IMPORTS 
 
Refs: A) State 79087 B) 2003 USDOC 5383 
 
1.  As requested in ref A, Econoffs delivered the demarche 
concerning ICMS (Merchandise and Service Circulation) tax on 
imported soda ash to Luis Balduino and Felipe Gastao of the 
Ministry of External Affairs\' (MRE) Market Access Division on 
April 15.  Balduino has been our working-level contact at MRE 
on this issue for the last year, designated by then head of the 
General Secretariat for Economic Integration and Foreign Trade, 
Ambassador Clodoaldo Hugueney.  Balduino clarified what 
Hugueney had earlier reported on a preliminary basis to 
EconCouns and Tradeoff about Itamaraty\'s action in the matter: 
that he consulted Rio State officials in September - October 
2003 to determine whether the acknowledged difference in ICMS 
tax rates for imported (19 percent) versus locally produced (2 
percent) soda ash can be viewed other than as a national 
treatment issue.  Balduino stated that the soda ash case is the 
only allegation of which he is aware that the ICMS tax causes 
negative effects on imports. 
 
2.  According to Balduino, Rio state tax officials maintain 
that the ICMS rate, levied on a per-transaction basis, remains 
theoretically the same for imported and domestically produced 
soda ash.  However, in the case of the Alcalis Company of Rio, 
this theoretical rate on soda-ash transactions is supposedly 
superseded by the fact that Alcalis has the right to pay simply 
a 2 percent ICMS levied on gross revenue, due to Rio ICMS tax- 
code provisions that grant this lower rate to producers and 
refiners of table salt (\"sal para alimentacao\" in Portuguese.) 
Econoffs asked the obvious question as to why this 2% rate 
should apply to non-table-salt parts of Alcalis\'s business. 
Balduino said Rio state officials assert that the ICMS tax 
cannot be declared discriminatory against imported soda ash 
because of 1) the difference in the calculation base, and 2) 
the opportunity of the soda-ash importer to recover the ICMS 
tax via tax credits.  The 2 percent ICMS rate on gross revenue 
does not allow for this sort of reimbursement.  State officials 
claim to Itamaraty that Alcalis may thus, in fact, pay more in 
net tax than an importer of soda ash would.  Balduino could not 
elaborate which, if any, downstream tax liabilities this 
alleged eligibility for ICMS tax credits could be claimed 
against by the soda-ash importer. 
 
3.  Balduino summed-up that the MRE at this stage, on the basis 
of the response from Rio state, had found no prima facie 
evidence of abuse of the national treatment clause, and 
therefore of any inconsistency with WTO obligations on the part 
of Brazil\'s (Rio state\'s) actions.  However, as a result of our 
demarche, Itamaraty will now pursue the case further, he said. 
He requested information on the potential consequences of 301 
and/or GSP action against Brazil as a result of U.S. soda ash 
industry petitions. 
 
COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION 
 
4.  To refute the Rio state authorities\' case, we now need to 
document the lack of substance specifically to their claim that 
tax credits accrued by soda-ash importers who pay a 19% ICMS is 
or can be recuperated via subsequent tax-credits, and that 
Alcalis is indeed ineligible for such credits.  From our old 
files of this case, it seems the same point may have been 
asserted in 2001; we cannot tell if the U.S. manufacturer has 
previously addressed it in the process of USG consideration. 
To verify if, in fact, Alcalis has been paying less ICMS tax to 
Rio state since the imposition of the 2001 Decree would 
presumably require access to the company\'s tax records.  It of 
course seems most unlikely that Alcalis could actually be 
assessed a higher ICMS liability than its imported competitors. 
Do updated figures from the U.S. industry show declining market 
share since the imposition of the 2001 decree?  It would also 
help if U.S. industry would identify major Sao Paulo glass 
producers (presumably the largest imports of soda ash) that 
have shifted purchases from the U.S. to Alcalis due to the ICMS- 
generated cost differences.  Post will shortly seek an update 
from the MRE on Brazil\'s position on this matter; meanwhile Rio 
Consulate-General FCS is trying to independently research these 
specific aspects. 
 
5.  Separately, in response to ref B\'s query on import 
procedures for soda ash, the MRE has confirmed that prior 
authorization from the Federal Police Department is required 
for soda-ash imports because of the potential for diversion 
from legitimate uses to uses involving narcotics or drugs that 
cause physical dependency.  Ministry of Justice decree 
(\"portaria\") 1.274 of August 25, 2003 details the requirements 
and lists soda ash as a chemical product subject to this 
authorization.

REF: BRASILIA 972 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY: Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham traveled 
to Brasilia April 19 to meet with Brazil\'s Science and 
Technology Minister Campos, Mines and Energy Minister 
Rousseff, and Foreign Relations Minister Amorim, as a follow- 
up to the June 2004 Presidential Summit between President 
Bush and Brazilian President Lula.  Also pursuant to the 
Presidential Summit, the GoB/USG joint working group for the 
hydrogen economy met for the first time; Secretary Abraham 
and Minister Rousseff signed an agreement on the hydrogen 
economy.  Foreign Minister Amorim and Mines and Energy Dilma 
Rousseff co-hosted a luncheon in honor of Secretary and Mrs. 
Abraham.  End summary. 
 
Ministry of Science and Technology Meeting 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  Science and Technology (MCT) Minister Eduardo 
Campos, accompanied by MCT Executive Secretary Luiz 
Fernandes and seven specialists, welcomed Secretary Abraham, 
Ambassador Hrinak, six DOE staff members, and Science 
Counselor Rubenstein.  Secretary Abraham set the tone by 
applauding Brazil\'s recent memberships in the Carbon 
Sequestration Leadership Forum and the International 
Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE), and expressed 
the desire to explore other areas of cooperation.  Minister 
Campos mirrored this wish to intensify bilateral energy 
cooperation.  There was agreement that particular areas of 
interest within both governments are collaboration on 
nanotechnology, renewables, nano-manufacturing, 
biotechnology, and scientific exchanges.  To facilitate 
expanded cooperation, Campos named Executive Secretary 
Fernandes as Brazil\'s point of contact, and Secretary 
Abraham named DOE\'s Office of Science Director Ray Orbach. 
 
3.  (SBU)   Secretary Abraham urged that the GoB sign the 
Statement of Intent (SOI) concerning cooperation in the 
fields of nuclear non-proliferation and counter-terrorism. 
He pointed out that the President had asked him to 
officially convey that Brazil is considered among the ten 
Nonproliferation Treaty states to have existing enrichment 
facilities and that Brazil will not be subject to 
restrictions to their nuclear supply under the President\'s 
enrichment and reprocessing proposal.  The Secretary also 
emphasized that Brazil\'s decision to sign the Additional 
Protocol is an issue between the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) and Brazil, not a bilateral one.  Secretary 
Abraham offered DOE technical assistance to help Brazil with 
safeguarding challenges in implementing the Additional 
Protocol.  Minister Campos stated that the GoB has 
safeguards at 35 installations and intends to negotiate the 
safeguards for the 36-th installation.  Campos appreciated 
the offer of potential US help in protecting proprietary 
technology during this process. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Campos expressed GoB\'s strong interest in 
executing the International Nuclear Energy Research 
Initiative (I-NERI) it signed last year.  Secretary Abraham 
and Minister Campos extolled the benefits of nuclear energy 
and its importance to the overall energy supply matrix. 
Points of contact designated during this meeting for I-NERI 
are DOE\'s Director of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science 
and Technology, Bill Magwood, and the president of Brazil\'s 
National Nuclear Energy Commission, Odair Goncalves. 
 
5.  (U)  Minister Campos listed some of the Lula 
administration\'s priorities, including alternative energy 
programs, biodiesel, and rural electrification.  Secretary 
Abraham expounded on the latter theme and stated that DOE, 
at times in conjunction with USAID, has worked with several 
countries on rural electrification programs, the Philippines 
being an example.  Secretary Abraham added that using fuel- 
cell technology to bring electricity to remote communities 
is an area of cooperation with GoB that DOE encourages. 
 
Lunch at the Foreign Ministry 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (U)  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and Mines and Energy 
(MME) Minister Dilma Rousseff co-hosted a lunch in honor of 
Secretary and Mrs. Abraham.  Seventeen Brazilians attended, 
 
SIPDIS 
including four ministers, five ambassadors, four secretaries 
and two chiefs of staff.  Other especially notable attendees 
were Development, Investment and Trade Minister Luiz Furlan, 
MME Executive Secretary Mauricio Tolmasquim, and Ambassador 
Antonio Guerreiro, Director-General of International 
Organizations.  In addition to the Secretary and Mrs. 
Abraham, U.S. guests included Ambassador Donna Hrinak, Chief 
of Staff Joe McMonigle, Senior Advisor Majida Mourad, Senior 
Policy Advisor Mary Alice Hayward, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for International Energy Cooperation David 
 
SIPDIS 
Pumphrey, Dr. Moustafa Soliman, Dr. Robert Dixon and Embassy 
EconCouns Wasilewski. 
 
7.  (U)  After the lunch, Minister Amorim, five senior 
Brazilian Foreign Ministry officials, Secretary Abraham, 
Ambassador Hrinak, DOE Chief of Staff Joe McMonigle, Senior 
Policy Advisor for National Security Matters Mary Alice 
Hayward, and DOE Foreign Affairs Advisor Margaret Manning 
and Embassy PolCouns Hearne(notetaker) met in Minister 
Amorim\'s office (Ref). 
 
Joint Team for the Hydrogen Economy 
----------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U)  Concurrent with Secretary Abraham\'s morning 
sessions, a separate experts\' meeting took place on the 
subject of the hydrogen economy.  MME Executive Secretary 
Mauricio Tolmasquim headed a delegation of seven from his 
ministry, and was joined by the following from other 
Brazilian entities: Maria Frank from Petrobras, Mauricio 
Cantao from the Institute of Technology and Development, 
Claudio Judice from MCT, and Paulo Miranda from Business 
Incubator COPPE/UFRJ.  Dr. Robert Dixon represented DOE and 
was accompanied by Energetics consultant Richard Scheer. 
 
9.  (U)  This joint working group on hydrogen energy 
development committed to several bilateral collaborative 
activities.  Brazilian and U.S. technical experts will share 
information on hydrogen technologies, and identify potential 
joint projects that will be funded through public-private 
partnerships.  The experts\' group also agreed on information 
exchanges through reciprocal \"study tours\".  The aim is to 
plan a strategy to stimulate interest in hydrogen-energy 
development in the Americas; a follow-on meeting was 
scheduled within three months.  The working group is to use 
the March 2005 IPHE meeting in Brazil to publicize and 
advance hydrogen technologies in the hemisphere. 
 
Ministry of Mines and Energy 
---------------------------- 
 
10. (U)  Minister Dilma Rousseff convened a meeting at MME 
including MME Executive Secretary Tolmasquim, various 
employees of MME, Secretary Abraham, Ambassador Hrinak, 
USAID General Development Officer Armstrong, five DOE staff 
members, and EconOff.  Minister Rousseff lauded the strong 
bilateral relationship between the U.S. and Brazil.  She 
highlighted the collaboration on the working level in the 
areas of carbon sequestration, biomass, and biodiesel. 
Rousseff reviewed other activities that have been completed 
since the June 2003 Presidential Summit in Washington, 
including the September 15-16, 2003 energy information 
exchange between MME and the Energy Information Agency, the 
October 28-29, 2003 meeting between the US and Brazilian 
energy regulators, and the November 21, 2003 energy 
symposium in Washington. 
 
11.  (U)  Both Secretary Abraham and Minister Rousseff 
praised the results of that day\'s first meeting of the 
U.S./Brazil hydrogen working group, which presented them 
with its formal report.  Rousseff called the meeting \"a 
milestone, leading to another chapter in our partnership, 
which sets the tone for consistent interaction.\"  She added 
that the joint hydrogen technology meeting set the framework 
for technical exchanges as well as for hydrogen road- 
mapping, and represented a breakthrough in public-private 
partnerships (PPP).  Note.  So-called PPPs are vital to the 
Lula government\'s economic agenda and hopes for 
infrastructure investments.  End note. 
 
12.  (U)  Press was then allowed in the meeting room for the 
Secretary\'s and Minister\'s signing of the Memorandum of 
 
SIPDIS 
Cooperation Between the United States and Brazil for 
Hydrogen Energy Technology.  Secretary Abraham expressed his 
deep thanks for the productive visit and emphasized the 
importance of this agreement for developing hydrogen 
technologies as different fuels become scarcer in the world. 
He emphasized that he had committed to visit Brazil during 
the June 2003 Presidential Summit, and that this Memorandum 
of Cooperation was a culmination of hard work over the eight 
months since. 
13.  (U)  The Secretary and Minister took questions from the 
press, the majority of which were directed to Secretary 
Abraham regarding the U.S. stance on nuclear inspections and 
the IAEA Additional Protocol.  Saying, \"The U.S. is not here 
to tell Brazil what to do,\" Secretary Abraham stressed that 
the issue was directly between IAEA and Brazil.  The 
Secretary emphasized that the overall purpose of his trip 
 
SIPDIS 
was to augment the already-robust energy cooperation between 
DOE and MME, and that he was in Brazil to follow-up on 
decisions made last June. 
 
14.  (U)  COMMENT: Although the prospective meeting with 
President Lula failed to materialize, all the rest of the 
GoB\'s top levels gave the Secretary\'s visit a great deal of 
attention.  Belying Brazilian media speculation in advance 
of the trip that the Secretary\'s objective was to pressure 
Brazil on nuclear inspections, all meetings went in an 
undilutedly positive atmosphere, without contention.  The 
relationship between DOE and MME ameliorated as a result of

partnership.  The hydrogen working group in particular 
should serve as a blueprint for deeper cooperation and

1.  (C) Summary:  Mission warmly welcomes your visit to 
Brazil.  Much is changing in Brazil.  Under President Lula 
there has been renewed focus on social issues and structural 
reform; economic performance, meanwhile, has been mixed. 
Urban crime poses an increasing threat to public security. 
The military budget is severely constrained and this is 
having a negative impact on military readiness.  Brazil is 
poised to lead the UN peacekeeping effort in Haiti with the 
deployment within two months of a contingent of about 1400 
soldiers.  At such a level, this would be the largest PKO 
deployment by Brazil since Angola in the 1970s.  The USG 
imposed ASPA sanctions July 1, 2003, when Brazil declined to 
sign an Article 98 agreement; we see no prospect that the GOB 
will alter its decision.  The USG and GOB remain engaged in 
seeking a solution to the airbridge denial (shootdown) issue. 
 Despite these challenges, many Brazilian officers want a 
strong relationship with the U.S. military and are looking 
for ideas and programs that reinforce our continued 
commitment to the partnership.  END SUMMARY 
 
OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
2. (SBU)  Since January 1, 2003, when President Lula assumed 
office, much has changed in Brazil.  By making deals with 
many of Brazil,s political parties, Lula and his PT party 
crafted a working majority in the legislature.  Led by 
Finance Minister Antonio Palocci, the Lula government 
continued the prudent macroeconomic policies of former 
President Cardoso; financial markets and the IMF have 
generally reacted positively.  Since early 2003, the &Real8 
has remained stable against the dollar and the country\'s 
market risk factor declined to its lowest level in years. 
Interest rates have declined almost 40% since their peak in 
late 2003 but in real terms they still remain high due to 
inflationary fears.  High interest rates continue to depress 
investment and growth.  During 2003 GDP growth was slightly 
negative, although some rebound is expected for 2004. Job 
creation remains moribund and foreign investment stagnant. 
Meanwhile, in early 2004 a political scandal hit the PT party 
and cost the government political support.  Despite problems 
within his party, Lula personally remains popular among 
Brazilians.  But it will be his ability to deliver economic 
results for the masses that will determine whether he can 
retain his high popularity until the 2006 presidential 
elections. 
 
3. (C)  Under President Lula, Brazil has become more involved 
on the world stage, including leadership of the Friends of 
Venezuela Group, greater engagement with Colombia, renewed 
ties with Africa and other \"New Agenda8 countries, co-chair 
of the FTAA, and possible leadership of the follow-on force 
in Haiti. The President travels extensively and in the last 
year, in addition to South America, has been to the Middle 
East, South Asia, and Africa.  He will travel in mid-May to 
China as Brazil extends its foreign policy reach to 
non-traditional regions.  Yet, despite the administration\'s 
increased focus on bilateral foreign policy, the government 
strongly favors support for multilateral responses to world 
events.  Brazilian President Lula opposed U.S. policy in 
Iraq, a position that broadly reflected Brazilian public 
opinion, although he later muted his public comments.  Brazil 
reacted with shock to the 19 August 2003 attack on the UN 
headquarters in Baghdad, in which respected Brazilian 
diplomat and UN Iraq chief Sergio Vieira de Mello was killed. 
 On January 1, 2004, Brazil assumed a two-year rotating seat 
on the UN Security Council.  Brazil continues to lobby to 
obtain a permanent UNSC seat and this topic is a key point 
raised by President Lula during his travels.  The GOB remains 
reluctant to criticize the Castro regime and recently 
abstained on a critical Cuba resolution at the UN Human 
Rights Commission. 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
4. (C)  On counter-terrorism operational issues, cooperation 
between the USG and Brazilian law enforcement and security 
services is good.  Unfortunately, recent media reports 
following published interviews with the disgruntled former 
Embassy Brasilia Legatt have led to political queries in 
Congress.  The GOB is hypersensitive to &unsubstantiated8 
allegations that terrorist groups are active on Brazilian 
territory, particularly in the Tri-border region.  Senior GOB 
officials maintain that there is no evidence to support 
claims that terrorists operate on Brazilian territory and the 
GOB has repeatedly asked us for specific information to 
support such allegations.  GOB police and security officials 
acknowledge that fundraising, money laundering, and related 
criminal activities are likely ongoing, but again, they 
request solid intelligence that would link funding with 
terrorist groups.  Brazil has a sizable population with 
ethnic origins in the Middle East, including many Brazilians 
who are economically and politically influential.  The USG is 
concerned that these communities contain persons who 
financially support terrorist organizations. 
 
5. (C)  Crime remains a severe problem in Brazil,s large 
cities.  In Rio, where violence has become endemic, a gang 
war in Rocinha, a favela notorious for crime and drugs, 
culminated with bloodshed and revealed the depth of criminal 
druglord control over the favelas. The police reacted by 
launching a highly publicized incursion into Rocinha.  In the 
countryside, the Landless Movement (MST) illegally occupies 
land, causing confrontations with landowners and the GOB.  In 
April the MST accelerated its occupations throughout Brazil, 
worsening an already tense situation in rural areas. A role 
for the Brazilian military in dealing with crime and public 
security is being reviewed, and President Lula appears to 
favor some increased military role. Many field-grade officers 
regard some armed forces involvement as inevitable; however, 
most senior officers are strongly opposed.  The military 
establishment is sensitive to the legal ramifications that 
could result from civilian casualties, increased corruption, 
and the residual legacy of 21 years of military rule.  Hence, 
it prefers not to take on police functions without prior 
adjustments in legislation and increased budgetary support. 
 
6. (C) Brazil has found itself in an uncomfortable spotlight 
regarding its non-proliferation credentials of late.  IAEA 
officials expressed disappointment with the Brazilians over 
the institution of a suitable inspection regime for the new 
enrichment facility at Resende.  In addition, the IAEA, the 
U.S., and many other countries have asked Brazil to sign an 
Additional Protocol to the NPT, a measure the GOB has 
resisted so far.  Brazil,s main argument is that the nuclear 
weapons states need to accelerate their disarmament even as 
the nonweapons states consider additional compliance 
measures.  Meanwhile, Brazil is considering signing onto the 
International Code of Conduct for missile technology but 
remains unenthusiastic about the Proliferation Security 
Initiative and the Australia Group. 
 
THE ARMED FORCES IN BRAZIL 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (C)  Since the end of military rule in 1985, the armed 
services have steadfastly supported Brazil,s civilian 
leadership and adapted to their new apolitical status. 
Brazil,s military has subordinated itself to civilian rule, 
under a civilian Ministry of Defense.  The officer corps is 
professional and dedicated to defending Brazil,s 
constitution. In recent public opinion surveys the military 
tops all institutions in the level of public trust, even 
surpassing the Catholic Church. 
 
8. (C)  Public esteem does not translate, however, into 
funds.  Military budgets have decreased steadily for 15 
years, with the severest cuts introduced over the last four 
years.  This has naturally had a negative impact on the 
readiness of the armed forces.  As President Lula stresses 
social priorities while working within tight fiscal 
constraints, the prognosis for the military\'s budget is for 
more of the same. The military grumbles that it is entitled 
to pay raises.  The lack of money dampens the force 
projection capability.  Procurement programs for new weapons 
systems to replace outmoded equipment are also starved for 
funds, while programs such as the development of a Brazilian 
nuclear-powered submarine and maintenance of antiquated 
vessels drain resources that could be better directed 
elsewhere.  One of President Lula,s first acts as president 
was to postpone a decision on the F-X jet fighter 
competition.  Minister of Defense Jose Viegas claims a 
decision on the F-X will be made &this year.8  Other key 
procurement decisions are also being held up. 
 
9. (C)  A major internal issue is the relationship between 
the armed services and the Ministry of Defense.  Defense 
Minister Viegas, an experienced diplomat with extensive 
service in political-military affairs, commands the respect 
of senior military leadership. However, as Viegas 
consolidated power within the Ministry, stress with the 
services was inevitable. The Minister created, for example, a 
four-star level secretariat of cooperative studies headed by 
a diplomat.  Many officers felt such senior civilian 
placements within the Ministry diminished the military\'s 
access and rendered it less effective in fighting important 
bureaucratic battles.  In addition, within the Ministry there 
are problems in the chain of command.  Although the Chief of 
Defense and the Secretary for Strategy, Policy and 
International Affairs are four-star generals with direct 
advisory roles to the Minister, their positions are 
unofficially subordinate to the service commanders.  Their 
ability to impose &jointness8 is compromised.  Morale among 
the senior military grades has been negatively affected, 
leading to transfers and some retirements. 
 
10. (C)  The services maintain close ties with counterparts 
in neighboring countries and there are no identifiable 
trouble spots in these relations.  Each service conducts 
annual or more frequent dialogue at various levels of command 
with neighboring militaries.  Army-to-army relations with 
Brazil,s neighbors, for example, are conducted at the chief 
of staff, regional command, brigade, and battalion levels. 
Despite a troubled history, relations between the Argentine 
and Brazilian militaries have never been closer.  Brazil is 
also doing some regional intelligence sharing, and there is 
steady improvement in this field with Colombia and Peru. 
 
SPECIFIC ISSUES 
--------------- 
 
11. (C)  Army Issues:  Brazil,s army has the lead in 
preparations for the 1400 man follow-on force for Haiti. 
While army leadership is confident in the ability of their 
taskforces to conduct such PKO missions, actual funding is a 
concern.  The army is attentive to Brazil,s borders, 
particularly in the Amazon Basin where it has relocated 5,000 
troops and established several new frontier platoons.  There 
is increased concern with the spillover effects of Plan 
Colombia and some skirmishes with the FARC have been 
reported.  While the army does not anticipate a direct 
confrontation with the FARC, there is recognition that FARC 
gunrunning and narcotics smuggling activities will eventually 
have to be challenged.  DAO has visited a number of frontier 
platoons throughout the Amazon.  They report that while the 
various commands may lack hardware and support, they are 
keenly aware of their mission and seem prepared to carry it 
out. 
 
12. (C)  Navy Issues: In recent years, the navy procured 23 
A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft from Kuwait and bought the former 
French aircraft carrier Foch, renamed the Sao Paulo.  Several 
pilots have already become carrier qualified in the U.S.  The 
Navy is sending on average two officers a year for flight 
training.  In March 2004, the navy signed an LOA for the FMS 
LINK 11 case to upgrade their secure communications.  In a 
program plagued by technological and design flaws, the 
navy,s nuclear submarine program has swallowed about $1 
billion in R&D costs.  The navy claims it is still 20 years, 
and $500 million, away from final development and delivery of 
a nuclear sub.  (We believe it would be much longer and cost 
much more.)   Meanwhile, the navy is in dire need of escort 
vessels, and is hard pressed to maintain its aging fleet. 
Navy command is interested in submarine rescue, diesel 
submarine, and UNITAS training and exercises. 
 
13. (C)  Air Force Issues:  The air force desperately wants 
to replace its aging Mirages.  Upon taking office in January 
2003, President Lula postponed a decision on a new generation 
fighter (F-X), an understandable decision given the cost 
involved, approximately $700 million. New Lockheed F-16 Block 
50 aircraft were previously offered in the competition. 
However, recognizing that other competitors might be 
preferred by FAB, Lockheed-Martin also decided to offer used 
F-16s in a deal that would provide the air force with capable 
aircraft at a fraction of the cost of new planes.  Recent 
soundings from the GOB suggest that in order to avoid the 
significant budgetary outlay, consideration is also being 
given to upgrade of the current Mirage fleet. However, FAB 
continues to focus on the procurement of new, not used, 
aircraft.  Regardless of the decision, GOB funding of the F-X 
will be difficult. FAB is also looking to replace its aging 
UH-1 helicopter fleet.  In February 2004, the FAB sent a 
delegation to Alabama to discuss possible modifications 
needed on the 6-10 Black Hawks they are interested in 
purchasing. 
 
14. (C)  SIVAM (Amazon Surveillance System):  Now almost 
complete, the SIVAM system being built by Raytheon consists 
of ground, aerial, and space-based sensors, communications 
and patrol aircraft.  Raytheon has had contract differences 
with the GOB and has threatened to stop its support unless it 
receives payments the company insists are due. Brazil has 
indicated its willingness to share data with neighboring 
countries under certain conditions. 
 
15. (C)  Article 98:  Brazil has not signed an Article 98 
agreement and is now subject to ASPA sanctions.  The GOB, in 
keeping with its long-standing &multilateralism,8 insisted 
it was committed to the International Criminal Court and that 
signing our Article 98 waiver would weaken this commitment. 
The Government also asserted that it could conceive of no 
circumstances under which it would subject U.S. citizens to 
extradition to The Hague. The GOB calculated that the 
projected loss under ASPA sanctions of $500,000 of IMET funds 
was tolerable.  However, the imposition of full FMS pricing 
for training, an unforeseen consequence of ASPA, caught the 
GOB by surprise and has caused additional frustration and 
friction.  Despite this additional blow, the loss of access 
to EDA grant funds, the withdrawal of the Spruance destroyer 
offer (combination sale and grant transfer), and the 
financial impact on the training portion of procurement 
offers such as the F-16, we do not expect Brazil to reverse 
its position on Article 98.  In fact, the MOD has indicated 
that it will continue training at the same level as pre-ASPA 
sanctions, just with other countries.  The armed services 
have already shifted training to Great Britain and France and 
may expand programs with Russia, China, and even Vietnam. 
 
16. (C)  Airbridge Denial/Shootdown:  Due to international 
treaty obligations and USG laws threatening possible economic 
sanctions, Brazil has not implemented its law permitting the 
shootdown/forcedown of civil aircraft suspected of illicit 
trafficking. In the last few months, President Lula has 
become personally energized in seeking a way to challenge 
suspected narcotraffickers who flagrantly violate Brazilian 
airspace.  The GOB has had confidential contacts with the USG 
on the issue in search of a solution. 
 
17. (SBU)  Despite Article 98 and other irritants in the 
relationship, we consider ties between the U.S. and Brazilian 
militaries good.  Brazil and the U.S. will continue to 
participate in joint exercises such as Cabanas and UNITAS. 
In June, the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan is slated to make 
a port visit to Rio. The MOD still views the U.S. military 
relationship as important and the U.S. a dependable partner. 
Brazil, as a strategic partner, remains important to the U.S. 
 Beyond ASPA, there remain many areas of defense cooperation 
and interaction, as well as areas of cooperation that remain 
untapped.  Many in the Brazilian Armed Forces recognize that 
they must expand their role in counter narcotics and counter 
terrorism.  As the MOD proceeds with the development of a 
National Military Strategy for Brazil, the U.S. can offer its 
perspectives on the process. 
 
18. (C)  Maintaining the U.S.-Brazil pol-mil relationship 
requires constant attention and, perhaps, more effort than 
with any other bilateral relationship in the hemisphere. 
Within Brazil, there is no institutional propensity to curry 
favor with the U.S.  Given its size, Brazil views itself as a 
regional leader and global player, even if it sometimes 
appears to fall short of what is expected from a world power. 
 The GOB will be eager for ways to enhance the bilateral 
relationship, overcoming the obstacles created by ASPA and 
Brazil,s rejection of an Article 98 agreement.  But the GOB 
will also remain sensitive that it not appear too eager to 
consummate deals with us that could backfire politically.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL MINIMUM WAGE DECISION REINFORCES LULA\'S 
FISCAL AUSTERITY 
 
REF:  BRASILIA 936 
 
1. (U) The GoB announced April 29 that it would increase the 
minimum monthly wage to Reals 260 (about USD 88) from the 
current Reals 240 (reftel).  The adjustment represents an 
increase in real terms of only 1.2%, despite considerable 
political pressure on the GoB for a significantly more 
substantial rise.  To assuage critics that it is 
shortchanging the needy, the GoB also announced an increase 
(from Reals 13.48 to Reals 20 per child) in a government 
stipend targeted at families with an income less than one- 
and-a-half times the minimum wage.  While the GoB\'s 2004 
budget originally called for a minimum wage adjustment 
sufficient only to make up for inflation (i.e. to Reals 
256.54), significantly higher than anticipated first quarter 
revenues give the GoB budgetary room for maneuver to cover 
the additional Reals 677.7 million cost over the remainder 
of this year without vitiating its primary surplus target 
(see septel on budget). 
 
2. (U) The minimum-wage level has repercussions throughout 
federal, state and municipal budgets.  While the federal 
government has comparatively few minimum-wage employees, the 
increase will have a big impact on state and municipal 
budgets, particularly in the northeast.  Many of these 
municipalities reportedly lobbied for an increase no greater 
than that which was granted, saying they could afford no 
more.  The problem at the federal level is the need to cover 
an increased deficit in the private-sector social-security 
pension system (INSS).  The minimum pension level is linked 
to the minimum wage.  A big factor here are the so-called 
\"rural pensions,\" which granted INSS pensions, albeit at the 
minimum level, to many agricultural laborers or small 
farmers who never contributed to the system.  The chart 
below illustrates the costs of the increase (which takes 
effect in June) for the remainder of 2004 and over the next 
twelve months.

3. (SBU) This decision appears to have been difficult for 
Lula on a very personal level.  He postponed the 
announcement several times and reportedly asked his economic 
team to review the numbers repeatedly to see if there was 
not wiggle room for a larger increase.  While Lula had 
already acknowledged that his campaign pledge to double the 
minimum wage in real terms by the end of his term was simply 
not possible, his history of having been born into a poor 
family makes him feel in a very personal way the need to 
provide relief for low-income families.  That the financial 
team won out on this issue illustrates yet again how deep 
Lula\'s commitment to fiscal responsibility has become.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S MUNICIPAL ELECTION PRIMER - PART I 
 
1. This is Part I of a two-part series on Brazil\'s October 
municipal elections.  This cable describes the structure and 
implementation of the elections, and Part II examines the 
various races in play around the country. 
 
SUMMARY AND OVERVIEW 
-------------------- 
2.  On October 3, Brazilians go to the polls to select the 
Mayors and City Councils of all of the 5,560 municipalities 
in the country.  These elections are important on two levels: 
 they are an interim report card on the popularity of the 
Lula administration and the various parties, and they will 
bring to power the local officials who are key to 
implementing national programs and maintaining grass-roots 
party strength.  In many municipalities --particularly the 
big cities-- the elections will also have an impact on 
national party coalitions into the future.  Brazil\'s 
constitution regulates all elections and their timing, so 
that the President/Federal Congress and Governors/State 
Assemblies are up for election every four years (i.e., 2002, 
2006), while the Mayors and City Councils are elected in the 
off-cycles (i.e., 2004, 2008).  All elected officials in 
Brazil serve four-year terms, except Federal Senators who 
serve eight years.  Executive officials, including Mayors, 
can serve only two consecutive terms.  As described below, 
Brazil uses a combination of majority and plurality voting 
(for executive offices, meaning a second round may be 
necessary); and proportional voting for open party lists (for 
legislative offices).  The electoral process, including the 
calendar and campaign propaganda, is tightly regulated and 
overseen by a hierarchy of Electoral Tribunals.  END SUMMARY 
AND OVERVIEW. 
 
 
WHO IS BEING ELECTED? 
--------------------- 
3.  The Mayors and Vice Mayors (elected on a slate) and 
unicameral City Councils in each of Brazil\'s 5,560 
municipalities are up for election on October 3. 
Municipalities range in size from the city of Sao Paulo with 
10.4 million people to towns of a thousand inhabitants.  226 
municipalities have populations greater than 100,000.  City 
Councils in small towns have authorities basically limited to 
community health, primary education, and municipal fee 
collection.  City Councils range in size from 7 to 55 
members, depending on the town\'s population.  The average 
municipality has 32,000 inhabitants and 13 Council members. 
The exact number of Council members to be elected this year 
has yet to be determined, because a recent Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal (TSE) ruling recalibrated the number of Council 
members per municipality.  That ruling would cut the number 
of Council members nationwide from 60,300 to 51,700.  While 
this would be a significant cost savings, particularly in 
small towns, the parties in Congress are loathe to see so 
many seats evaporate.  They are hurrying to pass a 
constitutional amendment that could result in 55,200 
Councilpersons nationwide.  The amendment must pass by June 
10 to overcome the TSE decision and affect this year\'s 
elections. 
 
 
ELECTION CALENDER 
----------------- 
4.  The electoral calendar is established by the TSE.  For 
those unfamiliar with the closely-regulated process, the 
dates are instructive. 
 
June 10-30, 2004 - Convention season: coalitions and 
candidate lists finalized. 
 
July 1 - Broadcast propaganda blackout begins.  No paid 
propaganda, polls, or programming favoring a candidate on 
radio or TV. 
 
July 3 - Ban on hiring and firing of public servants; ban on 
institutional publicity (e.g., public officials inaugurating 
public works). 
 
July 6 - First day of propaganda period, including rallies, 
posters and, sadly, sound trucks. 
 
Aug 17-Sept 30 - Period of free broadcast propaganda on TV 
and radio (see paras 5-6). 
 
Sept 18 - Start of period during which no candidate can be 
arrested, unless caught in the act of a crime. 
 
Sept 30 - Last day of broadcast propaganda, political rallies 
and debates. 
 
Oct 2 - Last day for sound trucks and pamphleteering. 
 
Oct 3 - ELECTION DAY (first round), polls open 8:00 am -5:00 
pm.  Within hours after polls close, results transmitted from 
nearly all 355,000 computerized voting booths to the TSE in 
Brasilia, which will release partial vote counts that 
evening. 
 
Second-round procedures (where necessary) similar to first 
round.  Oct 18-30 is free broadcast propaganda period. 
 
Oct 31 - ELECTION DAY (second round, where necessary). 
 
 
PROPAGANDA AND POLLING 
---------------------- 
5.  Election propaganda is tightly controlled in placement 
and content.  Placement runs from outdoor billboards to 
broadcast media to sound trucks, each with its own set of 
regulations.  For example, billboard owners must register 
their signs by June 25 with the local electoral judge, who 
then holds a lottery to distribute the billboards randomly to 
candidates.  Sound trucks must stop broadcasting at 10 pm and 
cannot be within 200 meters of government offices or 
hospitals.  Rallies must end at midnight.  Rules are 
specific:  propaganda cannot incite a state of passion nor 
try to trick voters, cannot defame an opponent or disrespect 
national symbols (nor provoke animosity toward the military). 
 Posters can be hung from bridges but not trees.  After the 
election, each campaign must clean up its posters from public 
spaces.  Parties monitor each other and are quick to complain 
to electoral judges about violations. 
 
6.  The free broadcast propaganda is a uniquely successful 
Brazilian institution.  Visiting US congresspersons, who may 
spend 90% of their campaign funds on TV time, express 
admiration for a system that provides free airtime to all 
candidates, thus reducing the need for incessant fundraising 
and the influence of donors.  From Aug 17 to Sept 30, mayoral 
races get airtime on Mon, Wed, and Fri; while City Council 
races have time on Tues, Thurs, and Sat.  The radio slots on 
these days are 7:00-7:30am and 12:00-12:30pm.  The TV times 
are 1:00-1:30pm plus the key 8:30-9:00pm prime time slot. 
The ads run on all channels simultaneously.  The minutes 
within these periods are distributed to the parties according 
to a formula mostly based on the size of the party caucuses 
in the Federal Chamber of Deputies, while still assuring that 
microparties get a few seconds of precious airtime each day. 
Parties in coalitions can merge their allotted times.  Thus 
the large PT, PMDB, PFL, and PSDB parties may run five or 
seven-minute ads each day.  The system is closely policed by 
all parties, with complaints quickly adjudicated by electoral 
judges who mete out punishments by docking seconds or minutes 
of airtime. 
 
7.  Public opinion polls are also tightly controlled. 
Beginning on January 1, polling agencies must register each 
poll with the electoral tribunals both before and after 
distributing the results.  The registration includes poll 
results, who contracted the survey, costs and methodology. 
Candidates have the right to challenge a poll to an electoral 
judge, who can order a polling firm to open its records, 
suspend a survey, or clarify results already released. 
Pollsters breaking the rules can be heavily fined. 
 
 
CAMPAIGN FINANCING 
------------------ 
8.  There are no limits on donations or spending.  Campaigns 
must register their financial committes with the Electoral 
Tribunal, and thirty days after the election they must file 
their financial statements.  Funds can come from the 
candidates themselves, personal or corporate donations, or 
fund-raising events.  Donations cannot come from foreign 
entities or public funds.  Donations must be identified by 
origin.  Unidentified donations cannot be spent in the 
campaign, though they can be retained by the party and used 
to fund party research or think-tanks. 
 
9.  Campaign financing rules are fairly lax by US standards 
and --owing to the free TV time-- the sums involved are 
modest:  in the 2002 elections for President/Federal Congress 
and Governors/State Assemblies, 19,000 candidates spent a 
declared total of R$830 million (about USD208 million, or 
about USD 11,000 per candidate).  Yet there are frequent 
allegations of illegal campaign financing and the so-called 
\"caixa dois\" (\"second drawer\"), i.e., secret campaign slush 
funds.  For example, the Waldomiro Diniz scandal that erupted 
in February 2004 involved a political advisor to President 
Lula who allegedly solicited bribes from numbers racketeers 
in 2002 to funnel into Workers\' Party campaigns; the 
allegations have not been verified.  Similarly, last week (a 
year and a half after the case was filed) the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal cleared Brasilia Governor Joaquim Roriz of 
charges that he funded his 2002 campaign with R$48 million in 
public money funneled through local institutions and 
consultants.  A political reform bill that would provide a 
fixed pot of public money to finance all campaigns is now in 
Congress but will not pass this year. 
 
 
THE ELECTORAL TRIBUNALS 
----------------------- 
10.  Brazil\'s elections are overseen by a hierarchy of 
electoral tribunals.  At the top is the Supreme Electoral 
Court (TSE), an ad hoc body comprising seven members:  three 
judges from the Supreme Federal Court, two from the Supreme 
Justice Court, and two lawyers, all serving two-year terms on 
the tribunal.  Below the TSE are twenty-seven Regional 
Electoral Courts (TREs), one in each state; and below the 
TREs are electoral judges in each municipality and citizens\' 
voting boards at each polling place. 
 
 
VOTING AND TABULATION PROCEDURE 
------------------------------- 
11.  Voting in Brazil is mandatory for citizens 18-70 years 
old and is optional for the illiterate, those 16 to 18, and 
those over 70.  Military conscripts cannot vote.  There will 
be about 112 million eligible voters this year.  In general, 
Brazilian executive offices (President, Governor, Mayor) are 
elected by majority voting, meaning that if no candidate 
surpasses 50% of valid votes in the first round, the top two 
candidates go to a second-round runoff.  However, in a 
cost-saving measure, plurality voting is used in the 96% of 
municipalities that have less than 200,000 voters (thus, 
U.S.-style, the leading first-round candidate becomes mayor, 
even if she receives less than 50% of the vote).  Therefore, 
there may be just a few dozen second-round mayoral runoffs 
this year.  All mayors will be sworn in on January 1, 2005. 
 
12.  Selection of legislatures, including City Councils, is 
done by a complicated open list proportional voting system, 
in which citizens can cast votes either for parties or 
candidates.  There are no wards for municipal elections, all 
candidates run citywide.  A hypothetical city of 1 million 
residents (i.e., about 620,000 voters) would have a City 
Council of 21 members.  If 20% of voters do not show up or 
cast null votes, then there is a pool of 500,000 valid votes, 
meaning that each of the 21 Council seats would require 
23,800 votes.  Each party then totals up the votes it 
receives both as a party and for its individual candidates. 
If a party fails to reach 23,800 total votes, it does not win 
any seats at this stage and its votes are \"lost\".  If a party 
receives 47,600 (i.e., 23,800 x 2) votes, then it wins two 
seats; if a party wins 71,400 (i.e., 23,800 x 3) votes, then 
it wins three seats, etc., distributed in order of the 
candidates receiving most votes.  (Thus the system is \"open 
list\", rather than a \"closed\" system where the candidates are 
selected in fixed order pre-determined by the party.)  By 
mathematical necessity, once all the parties that earned 
multiples of 23,800 votes receive the seats to which they are 
entitled, a few seats will be left over.  At this point, the 
votes that were \"lost\" earlier in the process are reviewed, 
and the final few seats are distributed to the parties 
receiving the most \"lost\" votes, even though the total is 
less than 23,800 per seat (meaning that microparties can win 
seats at this stage).  One oft-criticized by-product of this 
system is that popular candidates can win so many votes that 
they will be able to \"pull in\" more candidates from their own 
party.  For example, if a candidate personally wins 71,400 
votes, her party wins three seats even if the rest of its 
candidates receive no votes at all. 
13.  Nationwide, Brazil uses uniform state-of-the art 
domestically produced electronic voting urns that, since 
their introduction in 1996, have suffered no verified cases 
of fraud.  The urns are simple (resembling a cash register) 
and durable (some will arrive at Amazonian polling stations 
by canoe).  When the polls close at 5:00pm on election day, 
each of the 355,000 machines will print out its results on 
paper slips (for local party officials to inspect) and on a 
floppy disc, which the local electoral judge will immediately 
use to transmit the results to the Regional and Supreme 
Electoral Tribunals by secure intranet link.  Results, urn by 
urn and municipality by municipality, are later made 
available on the internet for inspection and challenge. 
Within hours, the parties and media will have done the 
complicated calculations and fairly comprehensive preliminary 
results will be publicly available. 
 
14.  Part II of this series will examine the various mayoral 
races in play around Brazil.

1. (C) SUMMARY.  Mauricio Correa, Chief Justice of Brazil\'s 
Supreme Federal Tribunal, will step down May 9 when he 
reaches the mandatory retirement age of 70.  This will be a 
great relief to the Lula administration because Correa has 
been a frequent and personal critic of President Lula and 
Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu as well as of many of the 
administration\'s policies and reforms.  Correa, a former 
Senator, never really stopped his politicking, and he is 
expected to run for office in 2006.  Correa\'s departure 
allows Lula to nominate his fourth Supreme Court justice. 
The post of Chief Justice rotates every two years, and the 
new Chief will be Nelson Jobim, a much less inflammatory 
figure.  The second-highest court, the Supreme Justice Court, 
also has a new Chief Justice who should likewise be less 
acerbic than his predecessor.  Correa\'s retirement opens the 
way for a long-awaited judicial reform bill to become law. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
MAURICIO CORREA DOES NOT GO GENTLE 
---------------------------------- 
2. (C) Mauricio Correa, Chief Justice of Brazil\'s highest 
court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF), reaches the 
mandatory retirement age of 70 on May 9, and his departure 
will be a great relief to the Lula administration.  Since 
assuming the top post in June 2003, Correa has been an 
unrelenting and bitter critic of Lula, his top advisors, and 
GoB policies.  In September 2003, Correa unleashed 
surprisingly personal vitriol against the administration in a 
widely-read VEJA magazine interview (ref A), calling Lula 
dishonest and saying that the authority granted to Chief of 
Staff Jose Dirceu was \"Stalinist\".  Lately, Correa has turned 
his gunsights on the administration\'s bills to reform the 
pension system and the judiciary.  In the eyes of many, 
Correa symbolizes all that is wrong with the Brazilian 
judiciary:  tetchy, turf-conscious, and corporatist.  It was 
Correa who threatened to declare the administration\'s pension 
reform bill unconstitutional if it reduced judges\' pensions, 
and Correa who blasted the October 2003 visit of a UN Human 
Rights Rapporteur (ref B) who criticized failures in the 
Brazilian judiciary. 
 
3. (C) Mauricio Correa was elected a federal Senator from 
Brasilia in 1986 as a member of the PDT party, and in 
1992-1994 he was Justice Minister to President Itamar Franco. 
 Franco nominated him to the high court in 1994.  It is 
widely assumed (and Correa has not denied) that he will run 
for Governor or Senator from the Federal District of Brasilia 
in the 2006 elections.  His eagerness to take partisan 
stances on so many political issues over the past year may 
well be his way of reestablishing his political profile in 
advance of his 2006 campaign.  This week was no exception. 
On his farewell tour, Correa spoke to a group of judges in 
Rio de Janeiro on May 3 and slammed the \"slackness\" of the 
Lula administration for endangering democratic institutions. 
 
 
NEW CHIEF JUSTICE NELSON JOBIM 
------------------------------ 
4. (C)  The new Chief Justice will be Nelson Jobim, currently 
the Vice-Chief.  Jobim, 58, is from the southern state of Rio 
Grande do Sul where early in his career he practiced and 
taught law.  In 1987, as a member of the PMDB party, he was 
elected Federal Deputy and served as sponsor (\"relator\") of 
key Congressional committees drafting the 1988 federal 
Constitution.  Last year, he raised eyebrows when he revealed 
that five articles of the Constitution were never properly 
approved (his book on the Constitutional Assembly is due out 
this year).  He served a second term in Congress (1991-1995) 
before President Cardoso named him Justice Minister 
(1995-1997) and then to the Supreme Federal Tribunal in 1997. 
 In 2001, he rotated into a two-year term as Chief of the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal (an ad hoc body always presided 
over by an STF judge).  In that post, he did an excellent job 
administering the October 2002 national elections.  Jobim has 
clashed with Correa over the past year, sometimes criticizing 
and sometimes trying to walk back the latter\'s acid comments. 
 Jobim is a proponent of judicial reform and, not 
surprisingly, it was he who revealed last year that the STF 
issues an incredible average of 85 rulings per day. 
 
NEW HIGH COURT JUDGE 
-------------------- 
5. (C) President Lula has made no announcement yet, but it is 
expected that he will name a well-known University of Sao 
Paulo law professor, Eros Roberto Grau, 62, to fill the 
vacancy on the bench.  The STF has eleven members, and this 
will be Lula\'s fourth nomination.  Grau is a specialist in 
economic and public law and is personally close to both Judge 
Jobim and President Lula.  He is also known to be supportive 
of Lula\'s views on judicial reform and agrarian reform.  The 
judicial reform bill, now pending in the Senate, includes two 
highly controversial elements:  the first would create an 
\"external control\" body --an oversight commission for the 
judiciary-- while the second would institute some form of 
precedence (not now in use in Brazil), whereby lower courts 
must follow certain decisions made by higher courts. 
 
 
SECOND COURT ALSO HAS NEW CHIEF 
------------------------------- 
6. (C) The STF is the highest of Brazil\'s courts, but the 
second highest court, the 33-member Supreme Justice Tribunal 
(STJ) also has a new Chief Justice.  Edson Vidigal, 59, 
rotated into a two-year term as Chief of the STJ on April 5. 
Vidigal is also supportive of the judicial reform bill, 
saying that it should bring much needed \"agility and 
transparency\" to the judiciary.  Just as Judge Jobim will be 
less combative than Mauricio Correa, Vidigal is likely to be 
less acerbic than his predecessor at the STJ, Nilson Naves. 
(Naves remains on the STJ but rotated out of the Chief 
Justice slot.)  Vidigal was a town councilman in his home 
state of Maranhao in 1964 when he was jailed by the military 
regime.  With the 1979 political amnesty, he was elected 
Federal Deputy and in 1987 was appointed to the federal bench 
by then-President Jose Sarney (now Senate majority leader). 
Sarney is from Maranhao and is the political godfather of 
many of that state\'s public figures. 
 
COMMENT - STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
-------------------------------------- 
7. (C) Brazil\'s sclerotic judiciary is in dire need of 
reform, but the thin-skinned Judge Mauricio Correa fought 
tooth and nail against any type of change while accusing 
reform supporters of infringing on the independence of the 
judiciary.  The reform bill now in the Senate is not 
sweeping, but it could bring much-needed administrative 
improvement in the form of a precedent system to speed 
decisions and make them more uniform.  The proposed oversight 
commission is really a reflection of the judiciary\'s 
longstanding reluctance to police itself, remove corrupt 
judges, and become more responsive to the country\'s needs. 
Like the retirement of Judge Correa, the reform bill will not 
resolve every shortcoming of the Brazilian judiciary, but it 
is a step in the right direction.  Incoming Chief Justice 
Nelson Jobim will likely continue to support reforms and help 
to end a year of squabbling among the three branches.

1. (U)  Summary:  In recent meetings with emboffs and Treasury 
desk officer, GoB officials expressed cautious optimism on the 
progress of legislation governing public-private partnerships 
(PPPs) and its initial application to infrastructure 
bottlenecks that threaten Brazilian exports and GDP growth. 
Private consultants and World Bank representatives provided 
somewhat less confident assessments of the federal-level PPP 
experiment, predicting further delays in passage of the 
legislation and voicing concerns on the tendering process and 
financing possibilities.  Minas Gerais state\'s PPP program 
compares favorably with the shaky start of the federal PPP 
effort, according to one consultant.   Even if and when the 
legislation passes, many details will remain to be worked out 
with the first PPP bids and contracts - perhaps too much 
uncertainty for most of the private sector to bear.  End 
Summary. 
 
PPP Bill Working Through the Senate . . . 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The PPP bill (PL 2546/2003) passed the Chamber of 
Deputies in March and is now under review by several Senate 
committees.  Ministry of Planning officials, while emphasizing 
that the PPP bill enjoys broad, non-partisan support, 
highlighted two areas of concern in Congress and the GoB\'s 
plans for resolving them.  The precedence or seniority of PPP 
contracts in the order of government payment obligations, just 
after debt and salaries, posed a constitutionality issue for 
some, forcing the removal of the offending article in the 
Chamber of Deputies.  Demian Fiocca, economic advisor to the 
Minister of Planning, explained that the GoB still considers 
precedence a necessary complement to the guarantee fund to 
attract PPP investors.  The GoB will not fight to reinstate the 
article in the PPP bill, but plans to include the PPP 
precedence language in the annual law that enables budget 
expenditure, reasoning that Congress will not object to a 
measure that requires their approval every year. 
 
3.  (U) Fiocca further maintains that the guarantee fund, made 
up of real estate, blue chip stocks and other liquid assets to 
include budgeted funds, provides the added security investors 
require to invest in Brazilian PPPs.  He noted that the 
specifics of the fund\'s content and management would not be 
decided upon until after the passage of the primary PPP 
legislation, thus requiring an appendix to the law.  Fiocca 
asserted that discussions with interested parties in the 
private sector indicate satisfaction with the general outline 
of the guarantees provided for in the legislation, with the 
caveat that the specifics in the appendix be \"well drafted.\" 
Dealing with exchange-rate fluctuations posed by external 
financing is another concern of potential local investors, 
Fiocca said.  He admitted that providing a hedge would be too 
costly, but talked of the possibility of setting interest-rate 
limits and having lenders assume timing risks, effectively 
decelerating repayments in devaluation years and accelerating 
in years of currency appreciation. 
 
4.  (U) The classification of GoB and state PPP expenditures as 
either debt or recurring costs for accounting purposes is the 
second Congressional sticking point.  The original bill 
specifically empowered the Federal Finance Ministry to assess 
each PPP contract to make this determination based on the 
relative level of private risk involved - little or no private 
risk would warrant a debt classification while substantial 
private risk, where supplemented with public payments, would 
render a recurring-expenditure classification.  According to 
Fiocca, congressional representatives of states that desired 
greater accounting flexibility in the classification of their 
PPPs forced the removal of this provision from the bill. 
5. (U) This has sparked some IMF concern that PPPs could create 
unacknowledged liabilities in public accounts.  Fiocca argued 
that this fear was overblown, despite the deletion of the 
clause, since under the terms of Brazil\'s Fiscal Responsibility 
Law (LRF) the Federal Finance Ministry will continue to 
determine how to treat state-level obligations.  By allowing 
the federal government to set repayment terms on the state debt 
to the federal government and limiting the contracting of new 
debt, the LRF effectively requires the states and 
municipalities to produce primary surpluses to be able to 
service their debt.  Fiocca explained that the deleted article 
was redundant and thus unnecessary, as the Federal Treasury 
would always retain the ability to account for PPP expenditures 
by virtue of the precedence of the Fiscal Responsibility Law 
(complementary law, inferior only to the constitution) over the 
PPP law (ordinary law.) 
 
6.  (U) Approval of the text by three Senate committees would 
eliminate the need for a plenary vote, but further changes in 
the Senate would send the bill back to the Chamber of Deputies. 
Several of our interlocutors outside the GoB predict the 
measure will be returned to the Chamber and may not be finally 
passed until the end of 2004.  Planning Ministry officials did 
not speculate on a passage date, but did predict the start of 2- 
3 pilot projects by the end of the year with up to R$ 5 billion 
(US$ 1.6 billion) in GoB investment.  Looking to stimulate GDP 
growth, Fiocca said the GoB wants to focus these first projects 
on multi-modal solutions to logistical bottlenecks, aimed 
primarily at agribusiness exports - ports, roads and railways. 
 
 . . . as High Risk Profile Remains 
----------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Noting the difficulty in legislating away the political 
risk of investing in Brazil, representatives from the World 
Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) did not agree that the 
guarantee fund was alone sufficient to attract investment in 
PPPs.  They cited a weak judicial system and the tendency to 
resort to inflexible legislation and the inability of 
regulatory agencies to guard against abuse and corruption as 
further complications.  The current uncertainty of the 
regulatory regime and the ideological divide within the ruling 
PT party on such key PPP sectors as water and sanitation also 
do not bode well.  A World Bank water specialist suggested that 
the Ministry of Cities, which has jurisdiction over water and 
sanitation projects and leans far to the left, would not likely 
favor private-sector solutions to Brazil\'s water and sanitation 
service woes.  Conflicts between state and municipal 
authorities over water rights as well as the GoB\'s dicey draft 
regulatory legislation for the sector (allegedly prepared in 
secret) would cause any investor to think twice in evaluating a 
 
SIPDIS 
Brazilian water sanitation PPP proposal. 
 
8.  (U) A PWC representative warned of pitfalls in the details 
of how PPP contracts will be tendered and how arbitration would 
be handled.  The bill addresses some of these issues 
superficially, but key determinations will likely be made only 
with the first PPP contracts.  PWC is working with the Ministry 
of Planning and the PPP management authority (comprising the 
Ministries of Planning, Finance and Civil Household), sharing 
with them model PPP contracts from other countries and helping 
them to set project priorities.  The PWC rep told us that 
Brazil is the first country with a sub-investment grade credit 
rating to attempt PPPs, making the undertaking very much an 
experiment, particularly given the culture of distrust between 
the public and private sectors. 
 
9.  (U) Echoing concerns similar to those of World Bank 
officials, the PWC rep noted the challenge of obtaining the 
value for money that PPPs promise in a judicially weak system 
that tends to over-legislate.  Warning of the currency risks, 
he wondered what institutions would finance Brazil\'s PPPs, 
noting that BNDES would not be able to shoulder the burden, and 
expressing uncertainty about IDB and World Bank readiness to 
invest heavily.  He characterized the GoB\'s announcement of its 
23 desired pilot projects in December 2003 as ill-advised, 
coming before legislation was in place and without carefully 
planned investor proposals for each project.  Some of the 23, 
he said, are actually in-process concession projects that have 
lapsed or failed.  In his opinion, the international roadshow 
that GoB officials mounted in the U.S., Europe and the Middle 
East late last year did not offer potential investors a 
reassuring picture of Brazil\'s readiness for PPPs. 
 
Bright Spot in Minas Gerais 
--------------------------- 
 
10. (U) Our PWC contact juxtaposed \"misguided\" federal actions 
with those of Minas Gerais (MG) state, where PPP legislation 
was passed and 5 pilot projects designated in 2003 without 
great fanfare.  MG is the only Brazilian state to pass PPP 
legislation; other states such as Sao Paulo have draft bills 
but are awaiting passage of the federal law before moving 
ahead.  The MG law does not address tendering procedures, 
preserving flexibility, according to PWC.  He said the state 
recently held a public meeting on a PPP water project, already 
providing potential investors details on project specifics. 
The smaller scale of these projects, the improved financial 
profile of the state, and its business-friendly administration, 
may be the best available launching pad for Brazil\'s PPP 
experiment, he argued. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (SBU) The Lula administration\'s goal is to develop a 
hybrid version of a PPP that corresponds to Brazil\'s needs and 
circumstances.  Key elements of success, such as firm high- 
level political commitment, clearly exist.  Guarantees that 
might be judged as transferring too much risk to the public 
sector in a more stable environment are essential in Brazil\'s 
context.  However, as one consultant noted, dispute resolution 
procedures, availability of long-term private capital, and the 
development of in-house expertise in the federal PPP management 
authority remain outstanding requirements.  The expectation is 
that this can all be addressed as \"pathfinder\" projects develop 
and act as the catalyst to resolve policy and legal issues not 
yet imagined.  Once legislation is passed, the difficult work 
of the management unit will begin, as it assesses the pilot 
projects and develops the first contracts. These partnerships 
are long-term solutions, and Brazil\'s hybrid PPPs will likely 
need to incubate for longer than their champions would like.

SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1.  (U) A high debt-service burden and extensive earmarking 
leave Brazil\'s federal government with little room for 
maneuver in its Reals 413 billion (USD 137 billion) 2004 
budget as it tries to pursue its social-policy goals while 
addressing public concerns over security, unemployment and 
growth.  In 2003, overall public-sector interest outlays of 
9.48% of GDP turned the GoB\'s hard-won primary surplus of 
4.32% of GDP into a nominal deficit of 5.16%.  This year 
there is some relief on the interest front, as the return of 
financial-market confidence has reduced rates on Brazilian 
debt.  The GoB estimates interest outlays of about 7.4% of 
GDP in 2004.  Given the GoB\'s resolute pursuit of a 4.25% of 
GDP primary surplus, that would cause the projected nominal 
deficit to fall to about 3.15% of GDP.  Discretionary 
expenditures (program funds and investment outlays) amount 
to about 13% of all federal outlays, including interest 
payments and mandated transfers to states and 
municipalities.  The transfers reduce the revenue available 
to the federal government by 15-16%. 
 
2. (U) The GoB\'s commitment to an austere fiscal policy, 
even as economic growth remains feeble, has made it the 
target of sustained criticism.  Pressure is building, 
through a series of strikes and work slowdowns and landless- 
movement squatter invasions, for larger-than-budgeted public- 
sector wage increases and additional money for resettlement 
efforts (refs C and E).  Official data shows that, by some 
measures, President Lula\'s Workers\' Party government spent 
less on social programs in its first year than its 
predecessor did the year before. 
 
3.  (SBU) Despite these pressures, we see no danger of a 
change in the GoB\'s commitment to its primary-surplus goal 
this year: Lula has made defense of his team\'s economic 
policy a constant feature in his public appearances.  Two 
April 15 actions reinforced this commitment: the Senate 
budget committee endorsed the multi-year budget plan, and, 
separately, Lula sent Congress the 2005 Budget Guidelines 
Bill, both of which set a 4.25% primary-surplus target for 
2005.  We do expect the GoB to tinker around the edges of 
the budget in this municipal-election year, including by 
accelerating the expenditure of some higher-than-projected 
tax collections from the first quarter of 2004 and finding 
even more \"savings\" by cutting expenditures from program 
budgets.  But we believe these adjustments will always be 
made with the overriding primary surplus goal in sight.  END

Budget Outline 
-------------- 
 
4. (U) Brazil\'s federal government collects 23% to 24% of 
GDP at the federal level.  About two-thirds of this (16.23% 
of GDP) is projected in 2004 to come from taxes and 
\"contributions,\" the largest of which are personal and 
corporate income taxes (5.1% of GDP), COFINS (a payroll 
contribution whose revenues, at 4.3% of GDP, are earmarked 
for social-security expenditures) and the CPMF, a financial 
transactions \"contribution\" (1.5% of GDP).  The remaining 
one-third is made up of private sector social-security 
contributions (at 5.48% of GDP) and of other income (2.25% 
of GDP, including dividends from parastatals, fees, 
royalties, and worker unemployment insurance fund payments. 
\"Importation Taxes,\" i.e., tariffs, are projected at Reals 
9.2 billion or 0.54% of GDP for 2004). 
 
5. (U) A constitutional revenue-sharing scheme mandates the 
transfer of 47% of all personal and corporate income taxes 
and 57% of the federal Industrial Production Tax (the \"IPI\") 
to states and municipalities.  In recent years these 
transfers have reduced overall federal income by about 15%- 
16%.  They have also given the federal government an 
incentive to create a series of \"contributions,\" which, 
unlike \"taxes,\" are exempt from the constitutionally- 
mandated transfer arrangements.  After transfers, net 
federal income (including social security contributions) 
currently fluctuates around 20% of GDP.  Brazil\'s total tax 
burden, once state and municipal taxes (notably the ICMS) 
are added in, was over 36% of GDP in 2003.

6. (U) To meet their primary-surplus goals, GoBs of recent 
years have limited non-debt-interest federal expenditures to 
between 17% and 18% of GDP.  The Lula government cut such 
expenditures in its first year, 2003, to 17.53% of GDP from 
17.83% of GDP in 2002.  It projects a rise to 18.3% of GDP 
in 2004 (Tables I - III).  Almost 87% of federal spending, 
including federal-level interest payments and transfers to 
the states and municipalities, is earmarked or otherwise not 
discretionary, i.e. committed to salaries and benefits. 
Salaries and benefits (including pensions for government 
employees) have swallowed as much as 30.85% of non-interest 
expenditures in recent years. 
 
7. (U) Constitutional and legislative earmarking leaves the 
federal government insufficient money to make interest 
payments on the debt and for required program expenditures 
and investment.  In addition to the mandatory transfers to 
states, income from many taxes is earmarked.  Revenues from 
\"contributions,\" which are taxes in all but name, are 100% 
earmarked.  Income from the CPMF, for example, which hits 
financial transactions, legally is required to be spent for 
Social Security, the Combat Against Poverty Fund, and health 
programs.  The solution to this budgetary Gordian knot was a 
legislative/budgetary artifice, the so-called \"DRU,\" that de- 
links 20% of federal tax and contribution receipts (after 
the required transfers to states) from the earmark 
calculation.  This gives the GoB some margin to cover 
interest payments, wages and benefits and have a little 
money left over for discretionary expenditures.  To obtain 
original passage of the measure in the early 1990s, it was 
made nominally temporary; in December 2003 Lula\'s GoB 
achieved its latest extension, this time through 2007. 
 
8. (U) After making wage and benefit payments, social 
security payments and other obligatory expenditures (and 
having netted out interest payments and transfers to the 
states) the GoB is left with between 20% and 22% of its 
expenditures to allocate at its discretion among ministries 
to cover program expenses (utilities, travel costs, etc) and 
investment (everything from computer upgrades at ministries 
to selected infrastructure projects - see Table III). 
(Note: Discretionary expenditures are about 13% of federal 
outlays if interest payments and transfers to states are 
included in the calculation.)  It is this discretionary 
portion of the budget which invariably is sequestered to 
meet primary-surplus goals.  There are limits on how much 
the GoB can try to save on these program expenses; the 
savings effort last year at times left some ministries 
struggling to pay their electricity bills.  In early 2003, 
Lula\'s then-incoming GoB cut these discretionary 
expenditures by over Reals 4 billion in nominal terms from 
2002, primarily by cutting investment outlays (see Table 
III).

2004 Expenditure Tensions 
------------------------- 
 
9. (U) The Lula administration, under the authority of the 
Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF), started 2004 by freezing 
Reals 6.6 billion in expenditures from the 2004 budget law 
approved previously by Congress. This was a GoB step to re- 
assert revenue realities (Ref B).  The Congress had adopted 
a series of optimistic revenue assumptions, including real 
GDP growth of 4% (versus 3.51% in the administration budget 
proposal) to justify the increased spending, most of which 
would have gone to finance pork-barrel investment (ref A). 
To soften the political impact of its spending freeze, the 
GoB said at the time that it would contemplate unfreezing 
some expenditures relatively early in the year, should 
revenues be higher than it projected. 
 
10. (U) Revenues through March have in fact been running 
ahead of projections: Ministry of Finance data show first- 
quarter federal revenues at Reals 75.3 billion, up 13.9% 
from the same period of 2003.  This represents a real 
increase of about 7.7% (deflating using the IGP-DI, a broad 
inflation index).  This resulted in a first-quarter 2004 
primary surplus of Reals 20.3 billion, well ahead of the 
Reals 14.5 billion target, despite having to offset an 
unexpectedly negative income of Reals 2.2 billion from 
parastatals (mostly accounted for by Petrobras dividend 
payments).  By comparison, the first-quarter surplus in 2003 
was Reals 22.8 billion, with parastatals contributing Reals 
3.2 billion to the positive outcome.  This implies a large 
positive swing in the federal-level surplus. 
 
Wages and Strikes 
----------------- 
 
11. (U) The GoB set aside Reals 1.5 billion in the 2004 
budget to accommodate projected wage increases for public- 
sector workers ranging from 7.1% to 29.4% (depending on the 
job category).  Under the threat of a general strike by 
government workers (Ref C), the GoB has improved its offer 
to the 9.5% to 32.3% range, an action that reportedly would 
increase the fiscal impact of the wage settlement by 500 
million Reals, for a total fiscal impact of about 2 billion 
Reals.  This new offer comes after the GoB\'s announcement of 
Reals 1.7 billion for the resettlement of landless movement 
(MST) families (ref E), an amount also not accounted for in 
the original GoB budget proposal.  These increased 
expenditures will need to be offset through reduced 
investment, greater savings in program expenses, and/or 
using some of the greater-than-anticipated revenues from the 
first quarter, which the GoB originally planned to hold in 
reserve until later in the year (ref B). 
 
12. (U) Refs A and G reports on Lula\'s oft-delayed decision, 
originally expected April 15, on the size of this year\'s 
increase in the minimum wage.  Explaining the delay, Lula 
told reporters that he needed to weigh carefully the social 
implications of the size of the minimum-wage increase 
against the need to invest to facilitate future economic 
growth, implying that the latter would have to be reduced to 
offset higher-than-planned wage expenditures.  Despite 
substantial pressure for a significant increase, in the 
event Lula raised the minimum wage by 1.2% in real terms 
(Reals 20), to Reals 260.  When coupled with a parallel 
increase in a social assistance payment, the 20-Reals 
increase should add Reals 677.7 million in expenditures 
beyond those envisioned in the 2004 budget document during 
the remainder of this calendar year.  This remains well 
within the budgetary cushion that higher-than-anticipated 
revenues have won the GoB. 
 
Investments 
----------- 
 
13. (U) The easiest target of cuts have been discretionary 
investment expenditures.  When it first came into office in 
January 2003, the Lula administration cut investment 
expenditures in nominal terms from the Reals 10.9 billion in 
the last year of the FHC administration to Reals 6.957 
billion in 2003 (an even more substantial cut in real 
terms).  And, while the Congress budgeted investment 
expenditures at Reals 12.9 billion for 2004, the GoB\'s 
freezing of expenditures cut that by almost Reals 6 billion. 
Through March 2004, only Reals 54.8 million in investments 
had been executed, Reals 47.4 million of which was by the 
Air Force.  This inability to finance substantial 
investment, particularly infrastructure investment, at the 
federal level increases the importance of Brazil\'s effort to 
attract investment to infrastructure projects through Public 
Private Partnerships (PPPs - Ref F).

Social Programs 
--------------- 
 
14.  (U) Lula\'s PT government has come in for considerable 
criticism over the low level of spending on social programs. 
There is some official data to indicate that Lula spent less 
on social programs in the first year of his administration 
than his predecessor Fernando Henrique Cardoso (FHC) did in 
2002, his last.  There was a decrease in nominal terms of 
the budget of the Social Assistance Ministry, which fell 
from Reals 1.2 billion in 2002 to Reals 1.0 billion in 2003. 
The GoB, however, claims an increase in social expenditures, 
from Reals 6.5 billion to Reals 8.4 billion, based on more 
inclusive measures of social-assistance programs scattered 
through many ministries.  By this measure, social spending 
increased 18% in real terms as well as increasing as a 
percent of GoB expenditures (to 3.2% from 2.7% in 2002). 
The Congress budgeted a much larger increase, to Reals 13.2 
billion for 2004, representing 4.2% of expenditure, in part 
as financing for a new secretariat to manage hunger 
alleviation programs, including the Bolsa Familia program 
(Table IV). 
 
Public Security 
--------------- 
 
15. (U) Polling data have consistently shown that the poor 
public-security situation is the area of greatest public 
dissatisfaction with the GoB\'s record.  While the state 
governments carry the main responsibility for public 
security and much of the expenditure burden, the perception 
of governmental inaction taints all levels of government. 
Federal public security expenditures have in fact increased 
slightly in real terms since the last year of the Cardoso 
government, and are budgeted to do so again in 2004. 
However, public-security spending still accounts for less 
than 1% of the federal budget and stands to decline slightly 
as a percent of expenditures inn the 2004 budget (Table IV). 
Industrial Policy 
----------------- 
 
16. (U) The GoB\'s splashy March 31 announcement of amounts 
to be spent on its industrial policy caused some market and 
media concern that this spending might endanger the GoB\'s 
2004 budget target.  The monies involved, however, are 
mainly earmarks for sector-specific lending by the Economic 
and Social Development Bank (BNDES) and majority state-owned 
Banco do Brasil.  Out of BNDES\' total 2004 lending target of 
Reals 15.05 billion for industrial development, the 
industrial policy earmarks Reals 3.61 billion for the 
software, pharmaceuticals, capital goods and 
microelectronics sectors.  The money is supposed to be 
destined primarily for modernizing plant and equipment in 
these capital-intensive sectors (ref D).  A further Reals 
550 million is slated to come from the 2004 budget to create 
research and development incentives, including by increasing 
staff at Brazil\'s Intellectual Property Institute (INPI) to 
ensure patent applications are given quicker handling. 
 
Military Expenditures 
--------------------- 
 
17. (U) Brazil\'s defense budget (excluding pensions and 
benefits) fell in nominal terms from Reals 12.6 billion 
(0.94% of GDP or 5.26% of federal expenditures after state 
transfers and interest payments are netted out) in 2002 to 
Reals 11.6 billion (0.76% of GDP) in 2003, representing 
4.41% of expenditures.  While Congress subsequently budgeted 
defense expenditures to increase to Reals 11.95 billion in 
2004, this would still represent a reduction to 3.9% of 
federal non-interest expenditures and a fall to 0.72% of 
projected GDP. 
 
18. (U) The biggest question mark on military expenditures 
is the much-postponed decision on the purchase of new 
fighter aircraft to replace Brazil\'s aging fleet of Mirage 
2000\'s.  Many of the financing plans presented by the 
competing consortia have a grace period before repayments 
begin, so these expenditures may well not figure in this 
year\'s budget even if the GoB were to sign a contract, which 
seems most unlikely.  On the other hand, payments for Lula\'s 
new Airbus ACJ reportedly are to come out of the Air Force 
budget beginning this year.  Although the Airbus financing 
plan for the $56.7 million plane was not detailed in the 
budget document, one media account said that an initial $1 
million would be due upon contract signature, followed by a 
$15.2 million (about Reals 45.6 million) payment later this 
year, out of an Air Force 2004 equipment budget in the 2004 
budget law approved by Congress of Reals 213 million. 
 
Social Security Deficits 
------------------------ 
 
19. (U) Aside from payments on the existing public-debt 
stock, the biggest looming threat to GoB budgetary health 
comes from the private-sector social security pension system 
(INSS).  While Lula\'s public-sector pension reforms last 
year should help \"staunch the bleeding\" in the public-sector 
pension system, keeping the deficit in this part of the 
system relatively constant at 3% - 3.5% of GDP for the next 
several years, the INSS system covering the private sector 
is a different story.  Contributions into that system are 
not keeping pace with benefit payments.  The INSS deficit 
widened from 1.26% of GDP in 2002 to 1.74% of GDP in 2003 
and preliminary reports for 2004 suggest the deficit 
continues to widen well beyond the 1.76% of GDP deficit the 
GoB projected.  Analysts predict that this growing deficit 
over the medium run will more than offset the savings 
attained in the public-sector pension reform of 2003 (Refs A 
and G).  An idea of the scale of the issue can be gleaned 
from the fact that the INSS (private-sector) pensions are 
expected to account for 40% of federal non-interest 
expenditures in 2004 (Table II).   While these expenditures 
are offset in part by contributions, covering the deficit 
will consume 9.6% of federal non-interest outlays. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
20. (SBU) Lula is personally committed to the primary 
surplus goal and gives all the signs of being more than ever 
convinced that current tight monetary and fiscal policies 
are necessary to set the stage for sustained growth. 
Questioned by a recent interviewer whether he is committed 
to this year\'s primary-surplus target of 4.25%, his 
exasperation-tinged response was: \"It won\'t change, it won\'t 
change, it won\'t change!\"  Nevertheless, the GoB is under 
substantial pressure to increase expenditures, and it has 
begun to accommodate these demands at the margins.  Better- 
than-expected revenues in the first quarter make this 
possible without vitiating the primary-surplus target, but 
the GoB originally had planned to hold any higher-than- 
expected revenues in reserve.  Should the current positive 
revenue trend not be borne out for the full year, the GoB 
would have to sequester more program spending.  Investment 
expenditures likely would suffer even more under that 
scenario.  All of this reinforces the importance of the GoB 
attracting private investments in infrastructure.

1. (C) On May 5, two developments starkly demonstrated the 
Lula administration\'s reduced authority in Congress and the 
weakness of the coalition\'s Congressional leadership.  The 
first development was the creation of a joint congressional 
committee to discuss the increase in the minimum wage that 
President Lula recently announced.  Had it been more adroit, 
the PT could have prevented the committee from being formed 
and/or prevented its leadership from being dominated by 
opposition parties.  The coalition parties will now have to 
suffer through criticism of Lula\'s small increase in the 
minimum wage --amplified by the fact that this is an election 
year.  The second setback was the revocation of Lula\'s 
earlier ban on bingo parlors, which he issued in response to 
February\'s Waldomiro Diniz scandal.  Ultimately, neither 
event is likely to have substantive effect, as the minimum 
wage will likely stay at the Lula-decreed level and the bingo 
parlors could well end up either banned or tightly regulated. 
 But the message is clear:  through a combination of 
incompetence and waning authority, the Lula administration\'s 
control over Congress has been attenuated.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
MINIMUM WAGE TO BE REVIEWED BY A JOINT COMMITTEE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2. (C) On May 5, the opposition in the Brazilian Congress 
succeeded in setting up a joint committee to review Lula\'s 
recent decree (MP 182) that raised Brazil\'s minimum wage from 
R$240 to R$260 (about USD 87) per month.  That raise is 
barely above inflation and is considered insufficient by some 
in Lula\'s own PT party.  It has been used by opponents to 
show how Lula\'s fiscal austerity is hurting Brazilian 
workers.  (N.b., presidential decrees (MPs) must be ratified 
by Congress to remain in force.  Sometimes a joint committee 
first reviews the MP, which then goes to the floor.  However, 
the preference of the government is simply to not appoint a 
committee --thus avoiding messy hearings-- meaning the MP 
goes straight to the floor where it generally gets easy 
approval.) 
 
3. (C) The joint committee was formed when several members of 
the governing coalition signed the opposition\'s petition 
supporting it.  For example, PT Senator Paulo Paim has 
pressed for a larger increase in the minimum wage, and he 
signed in order to register his displeasure with Lula\'s small 
increase.  On the other hand, Green Party Deputy Sarney Filho 
signed without understanding what he was doing.  He later 
complained that the coalition leadership had failed to stay 
on top of the issue and keep members advised.  Opposition 
members won all of the committee\'s key leadership posts, and 
Sen. Paim was among several coalition members removed from 
the committee by their party leaders as punishment for their 
mini-rebellion. 
 
4. (C) For all the arcane parliamentary tactics, the 
formation of a committee to review MP 182 means there will be 
public hearings, a public report, and public votes, causing a 
political headache for Lula and his loyalists, who will now 
have to put their preference for a smaller increase on 
record.  The opposition will fan the debate for partisan 
purposes in advance of the October municipal elections. 
Ultimately, the minimum wage is unlikely to change 
(especially since Lula has various ways to veto any increase 
over R$260), but these events demonstrate the GoB\'s weakness 
in Congress, the unhappiness of some members of the PT-led 
coalition, and the organizational failure of the coalition\'s 
leadership, who should have headed off this development.  The 
minimum wage is a fight that Lula never expected to have to 
wage in Congress, and it is a poor use of his limited 
political capital. 
 
 
BINGO REVERSAL ANOTHER SETBACK FOR LULA 
--------------------------------------- 
5. (C) The second May 5 blow to the administration was the 
Senate rejection of another presidential decree:  MP 168 that 
Lula issued in February to ban bingo and slot parlors.  That 
MP was Lula\'s first and firmest response to the \"Waldomiro 
Diniz scandal\" (ref A).  MP 168 shut down the 9,000 legal 
parlors around the country, and it has been fiercely opposed 
by the estimated 70,000 gaming employees thrown out of work. 
It is widely believed here that the parlors are linked to 
organized crime, so few public officials have spoken out 
against Lula\'s decision to close them. 
 
6. (C) On March 30, the Chamber of Deputies ratified the MP, 
although coalition squabbling forced Lula to disburse pork 
spending to secure the necessary votes (ref B).  The measure 
should have easily passed into law when it reached the Senate 
floor on May 5, but the opposition simply outsmarted the 
coalition\'s floor leaders.  In the end, the MP was defeated 
by a 33-31 vote.  Emblematic of their own confusion, 
coalition leaders seemed shocked by the defeat, never 
realizing that they had failed to count noses: the MP failed 
by two votes, yet four PT members were absent, including, 
amazingly, the coalition\'s floor leader, Sen. Aloizio 
Mercadante.  Six other coalition Senators were absent and 
eight voted against the MP.  The defeat of the bingo MP is 
being called by some Lula\'s first real defeat in Congress 
since he took office.  The symbolic import of MP 168 --Lula\'s 
response to an in-house scandal and to organized crime-- 
should have made it a must-win for his congressional 
coalition, but they let him down. 
 
 
DEFEAT HAS A HUNDRED FATHERS 
---------------------------- 
7. (C) The bingo ban is being autopsied in the daily 
newspapers, but those most responsible for its death include 
the PT leaders in the Senate, Ideli Salvatti and Aloizio 
Mercadante, who failed to do the necessary whip-work to line 
up and count their votes.  Six of the coalition\'s 22 PMDB 
Senators voted against the MP, one more example of how the 
divisions in that party are damaging Lula\'s agenda. 
Delighted gaming operators began reopening the next day, but 
their glee is likely to be short-lived.  Lula is preparing a 
bill that would have the same effect as the defeated MP 168, 
banning bingo and slots.  The opposition --not wishing to be 
perceived as pro-organized crime-- is drafting its own bill 
that would allow some parlors to remain open while banning 
slot machines.  Few in the opposition are pro-bingo, they 
simply saw the opportunity to defeat Lula\'s disorganized 
coalition on a key bill, and they took it. 
 
 
COMMENT - PT\'S CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP IN DISARRAY 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
8. (C) The events in Congress on May 5 highlight three 
dynamics:  abysmal work on the floor by the coalition\'s 
leadership --and particularly the PT caucus in the Senate; 
displeasure among many in the PT with the small increase in 
the minimum wage, which is a real problem for a labor party; 
and continued divisions in the coalition\'s large, fractious 
PMDB party.  Last week\'s events will, and will not, have 
consequences.  The minimum wage will probably stay at the 
R$260 level that Lula decreed, and bingo parlors may well be 
closed down again.  But the bigger picture is that it is no 
longer clear that Lula and the PT exert enough control over 
their own coalition to win key Congressional votes, which 
will limit the administration\'s ability to pursue its policy 
agenda. 
 
9. (C) This is not exactly new.  The coalition relied on many 
opposition votes to pass the pension and tax reforms last 
year and will continue to attract those votes on upcoming 
issues like judicial reform and biotechnology.  But in 
another sense, the coalition has never been weaker.  The PTB 
and PP parties ceaselessly clamor for pork spending and are 
not shy about obstructing the administration\'s agenda.  The 
large PMDB has never been less reliable, and in addition to 
its normal fractiousness, it is now riven by a dispute 
between two of its leading senators (Jose Sarney and Renan 
Calheiros) over who will be the next Senate majority leader. 
And as noted, the PT\'s floor leaders in the Senate fell down 
on the job last week, while party dissidents complained about 
the small minimum wage increase.  This dispute will not go 
away, and some PT members may defy party orders and vote 
against the R$260 wage when the MP comes to the floor. 
 
10. (C) Finally, the coalition\'s weakness is causing distrust 
between the two houses.  Last year, the Chamber defied 
difficult publicity and sent tough, responsible pension and 
tax reform bills to the Senate, only to see the Senate water 
them down and get credit from voters.  The Senate is 
inherently less-disciplined than the Chamber, more subject to 
grandstanding and less willing to follow party directives. 
The Senate\'s maneuvers last week only reinforced the 
perception among Deputies that Senators will steal the glory 
but not share the pain on controversial issues.  If this 
perception is not remedied, it may make the Chamber gunshy 
and unwilling to vote for tough reform bills in the future.

John Taylor, Ministry of Finance Treasury Secretary Joaquim 
Levy, and Economic Policy Secretary Marcos Lisboa presided 
on April 19 in Rio de Janeiro over the second meeting of the 
Treasury/Ministry of Finance Group for Growth (GfG), an 
outcome of the June 2003 summit between Presidents Lula and

investment and access to credit; prospects for growth in 
both countries were also presented.  This cable reports on 
the extensive general discussion of Brazil\'s economic 
situation and the GoB policy agenda.  Lisboa pronounced 
Brazil\'s 2002-2003 macroeconomic stabilization efforts a 
success, with the current sharp drop in inflation, stable 
debt-to-GDP ratio, and lowest real-interest rates in a 
decade.  Levy added that Brazil is now less vulnerable to 
external shocks, thanks to to lower exchange-rate 
volatility, reductions in dollar-based debt, and increased 
exports.  The GoB officials maintained their expectation of 
3.5% economic growth this year and claimed that solid 
recovery began in the second half of 2003.  Lisboa also 
focused in detail on the GoB\'s microeconomic and structural 
reform agenda, which aims to sustain growth by decreasing 
banking spreads, creating incentives for entrepreneurship, 
sparking innovation, and providing an affordable social- 
safety net.  Levy addressed the fiscal situation in more 
detail, discussing debt-servicing, the rising tax burden, 
and falling central-government investment levels.  He said 
the single biggest fiscal challenge facing the GoB is the 
social-safety net.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
2.   (U) Treasury U/S for International Affairs John Taylor, 
Ministry of Finance Treasury Secretary Joaquim Levy and 
Economic Policy Secretary Marcos Lisboa presided over the 
second Group for Growth (GfG) meeting in Rio de Janeiro on 
April 19.  The GfG is an outcome of the June 2003 summit 
meeting of Presidents Bush and Lula.  The first GfG meeting 
was held in Washington in September 2003 and focused on 
productivity growth.   This second meeting focused on 
infrastructure issues and access to credit, including micro 
credit, as well as on current prospects for growth in both 
countries.  The U.S. delegation, led by U/S Taylor, included 
Treasury DAS Nancy Lee, DAS for Public Affairs Tony Fratto, 
Western Hemisphere Office Director Ramin Toloui, Brazil Desk 
Officer Stephanie Segal, Regional Treasury Attache Matthew 
Haarsager, Rio Econoff and Emboff.  In addition to Levy and 
Lisboa, the Brazilian delegation was rounded out by Ministry 
of Finance staffers Aline Diegues and Daniel Silgemann. 
Additional presentations were made by Armando Castelar of 
Brazil\'s Institute for Applied Economic Studies, who spoke 
on infrastructure and investment, Elizabeth Wallace of the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), who 
outlined a micro-credit pilot project being implemented in 
Russia and former Soviet republics, and Carlos dos Santos of 
Brazil\'s technical assistance agency for small businesses 
(SEBRAE), who spoke on SEBRAE\'s role in the provision of 
micro-credit. 
 
The Starting Point 
------------------ 
 
3.   (U) Lisboa gave an extensive briefing on Brazil\'s 
current economic situation and the GoB policy agenda.  The 
2002 crisis, he said, arose from a combination of external 
shocks with fiscal imbalances, which resulted in a sharp 
exchange-rate devaluation, acceleration of inflation, 
increased country risk, and difficulties rolling over public 
debt.  The new GoB\'s macroeconomic stabilization effort has 
reduced inflation to an expected 6% in 2004, after a spike 
of 17.2% in 2003.  The increase in interest rates necessary 
to combat the sharp increase in inflation, however, led to 
reductions in real wages, a fall in domestic demand and 
ultimately to negative real GDP growth of 0.2% in 2003. 
Those factors notwithstanding, Lisboa pointed out that this 
result compared favorably to financial/payments crises in 
other countries such as Russia in 1998, Mexico in 1994 and 
Thailand in 1997, where the subsequent falls in GDP were 
much sharper, ranging from -4.9% in Russia to -10.5% in 
Thailand. 
 
Successful Adjustment 
--------------------- 
 
4.   (SBU) Lisboa pronounced GoB 2002/2003 stabilization 
efforts a success.  The goal was to control inflation so as 
to stop the slide in real wages, reduce real interest rates, 
and mitigate sources of external vulnerability, thus laying 
a foundation for more sustainable growth.  Fiscal adjustment 
was key to all these goals and was the first priority upon 
President Lula\'s entering office.  The increase in Brazil\'s 
national tax burden, up from 28% in 1998 to 36% of GDP in 
2003, has been the single most important long-term 
contributor to fiscal adjustment. 
 
5.    (SBU) Levy and Lisboa emphasized that Federal non- 
interest expenditures fell as a percentage of GDP in 2003, 
contributing to the adjustment.  They admitted that it had 
occurred in large part through real reductions in the 
government wage bill.  The fiscal adjustment (and the return 
of financial-market confidence), in turn, allowed an easing 
of interest rates.  Real interest rates are now at their 
lowest since the Plano Real was introduced in 1994. 
External vulnerability had been reduced by sharply reducing 
the quantity of exchange-rate-linked public debt.  Stellar 
export growth has reduced the net-external-debt-to-exports 
ratio from 3.6 in 1999 to 2.2 in 2004.  The current account 
turned positive in 2003 for the first time since 1994 and is 
expected to remain so this year. 
 
6.    (SBU) The biggest challenge to fiscal sustainability, 
according to Levy, is the social-safety net.  Brazil in 2002 
paid out almost 11% of GDP on public and private sector 
pension benefits, a level comparable to that of Sweden, even 
though Sweden\'s retirement-age population, as a percentage 
of its workforce, is almost double that of Brazil.  The 
issue is primarily with the private-sector (INSS) system, 
Levy said, as last year\'s reform of the public-sector 
pension system had halted the growth of the deficit in that 
system.  Levy predicted that the GoB would be forced to make 
hard decisions in the near future, including a cap on 
pension benefits in the INSS system. 
 
Current Growth Scenario 
----------------------- 
 
7.   (U) Lisboa maintained there is considerable evidence 
that the economy has already returned to a growth 
trajectory.  Industrial production of consumer durables, 
capital goods, and intermediate goods all recovered in the 
last quarter of 2003 and continued to grow in the first 
months of 2004 (although there was a drop in both consumer- 
durables and capital-goods production from January to 
February 2004).  The retail-sales index shows a similar 
evolution.  Unemployment data, Lisboa said, was mixed.  The 
official unemployment rate, based on household surveys in 
only a few major cities, has risen.  However, Lisboa opined 
that the increase was because many who had formerly stopped 
actively seeking work, thus falling off the statistical 
radar, are now hopefully re-entering the job force, swelling 
the ranks of the unemployed for purposes of the calculation. 
Other measurements, including surveys of hiring by firms, 
showed 3.37% growth in formal jobs from March 2003 to March 
2004.  Much of this job growth reported by firms was taking 
place outside the large urban centers, however, and so was 
not reflected in the official unemployment-rate calculation. 
Lisboa presented a breakdown showing job growth of 4% 
outside urban centers, much of this from agribusiness, and 
only 2.5% job growth in urban areas.  This added up to 
almost 100,000 more jobs created, in absolute terms, outside 
of urban areas than in urban areas, he said. 
 
Longer-Term Sustainability 
-------------------------- 
 
8.    (U) Macroeconomic indicators aside, Lisboa 
acknowledged that the microeconomic agenda is key to 
sustainable growth.  One GOB priority is passage of the 
Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) law to attract private 
infrastructure investment.  Lisboa added that the Finance 
Ministry has been working to eliminate barriers to 
entrepreneurship and to promote innovation.  On the former 
front, Lisboa reported success in obtaining agreement from 
all but one of Brazil\'s states on a unified system and set 
of procedures for setting up a business.  The next step is 
to obtain the same agreements from each of Brazil\'s 5000- 
plus municipalities.  Lisboa hoped to complete this 
painstaking task within another one to two years.  The 
result would be a one-stop shop, allowing anyone to fill out 
one form to create a small business.  Still under debate in 
the Senate, the bankruptcy law, modeled on the U.S. Chapter 
11, aims to create a more rational system that better 
secures creditor rights while giving businesses a chance to 
emerge from bankruptcy whole, something that does not happen 
today.  Reform of the competition law, also planned, would 
help create a more benign environment for small business. 
 
9.    (U) Levy argued that, at heart, the GoB\'s evolving 
industrial policy is \"an innovation policy,\" aiming to 
strengthen a network of laboratories and create incentives 
for research and development work.  A key part of this 
effort is to strengthen the Intellectual Property Institute 
(INPI) so as to clear the backlog of patent applications and 
give innovators some hope of securing their rights.  Lisboa 
added that a new Innovation Law would allow professors and 
their universities to benefit from the profits of their own 
research, as U.S. universities do. 
 
Access to Credit 
---------------- 
 
10.  (U) In the discussion about increasing access to 
credit, Levy and Lisboa outlined several macroeconomic and 
structural issues that contribute to Brazil\'s infamously 
high interest-rate spreads and difficulties of small firms\' 
access to credit.  The primary, well-known reason offered 
was that the Government\'s high borrowing needs crowd out 
private sector and consumer credit, forcing interest rates 
higher.  While that problem may not be fixable in the near 
future, the GOB is attacking the problem from the other 
side, such as with a current bill which favors applying anti- 
trust laws in the financial sector.  Other initiatives aim 
to improve the functioning of housing markets, including by 
creating a framework for new financial instruments and 
securitization of mortgages, and to require banks to share 
credit information with other financial institutions at the 
borrower\'s request (personal credit histories should improve 
a borrower\'s ability to shop among banks.) 
 
11.  (U) Carlos dos Santos, of the Federation of Industries\' 
technical assistance agency for small businesses (SEBRAE), 
outlined the stark reality of access to credit by small 
businesses in Brazil.  A government survey recently found 
that of 10 million micro-enterprises (those with 6 or fewer 
employees) in Brazil, most are informal and only 4.9% had 
access to credit.  While formally-registered firms 
theoretically have a few more options, a survey of 400,000 
small but formal businesses in Sao Paulo found that 79% had 
no access to banking credits.  Those that could get 
financing often relied on supplier credits (64% of cases), 
state-owned banks (3%) or loan sharks (3%).  Many 
entrepreneurs wind up using credit cards at usurious rates. 
When small businesses can get bank loans, they are at 
spreads of up to 43.5% above the base SELIC rate.  Factors 
contributing to spreads were credit risk, taxes (up to a 
quarter of the spreads), lack of judicial enforcement of 
collateral, and lack of competition among banks, Santos 
said. 
 
12.  (U) Elizabeth Wallace, who manages a pioneering micro- 
credit program for the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD), outlined the program\'s market-oriented 
approach to train banks and bankers in techniques to make 
micro-credit lending a profit center.  The EBRD program 
leverages existing banking infrastructure but emphasizes 
training and technical assistance to alter banks\' business 
models and loan-officers\' mindsets as well as transfer 
credit technology, introduce credit analysis and streamline 
procedures.  The program also stresses the importance of 
commercial pricing of loans, and of adequate scale to spread 
fixed costs in order to ensure the viability of micro-credit 
lending.  Competition among micro-lenders to bring down 
spreads is also critical.  The EBRD program has achieved 
costs as low as $59/loan in origination and administration 
fees, without sacrificing portfolio quality, a far lower 
rate than comparable programs administered by NGOs, asserted 
Wallace. 
 
Infrastructure Investment 
------------------------- 
 
13.  (U) Armando Castelar Pinheiro of the Institute for 
Applied Economic Studies noted that periods of higher 
investment rates have clearly been correlated with higher 
productivity growth in Brazil.  Investment rates, however, 
declined significantly early in the 1980s.  Subsequent 
economic reforms at the beginning of the 1990\'s helped 
increase investment rates and concomitant productivity 
growth, but investment still remains low in comparative 
terms, at 19% of GDP.  The picture was further complicated 
in the late 1990\'s and early 2000\'s by increasing public 
deficits, which reduced public investment and soaked up 
private savings. 
 
14.  (U) Levy and Lisboa outlined steps the GoB is taking to 
increase savings and investment.  It has created a new set 
of investment accounts that allow investors to rebalance 
their portfolios without being subjected to the financial 
transactions tax (CPMF).  This should help reduce the CPMF\'s 
distortion of investment decisions.  The GoB also has begun 
to exempt capital goods from the industrial production tax 
in hopes of encouraging firms to invest. 
 
15.  (U) The centerpiece of the GoB\'s efforts to increase 
investment is its draft law on Public-Private Partnerships 
(PPPs).  The PPP bill, currently undergoing Senate scrutiny 
after passage in the Chamber of Deputies, would create a 
framework for long-term private investment in infrastructure 
to be paid back through user fees.  Importantly, in cases 
where the return on the project is not sufficient to justify 
private investment, the public sector could subsidize the 
project or top-up the payment stream.  A guarantee fund 
would give long-term security to the private investors. 
Castelar lauded those positive points of PPPs, but pointed 
out several problems with their application in the Brazilian 
context.  These include the uncertainty over the conduct of 
Brazil\'s sometimes mercurial judges and over project 
jurisdiction, the absence of a sound regulatory framework in 
many sectors, as well as problems in obtaining environmental 
licenses (and judicial intervention in that process), and 
open questions regarding the appropriate 
budgeting/accounting treatment for PPPs.  Uncertainty over 
the commitment of future administrations to PPP guarantees 
could be overcome if the public sector makes a sufficient 
down payment up-front, Castelar noted. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16.  (SBU) This GfG meeting was characterized by candid 
discussion of Brazil\'s current economic situation and the 
challenges that the GoB\'s policy agenda faces.  The 
discussion of the EBRD micro-credit experience in Eastern 
Europe and Eurasia provoked the most numerous and pointed 
questions from Levy and Lisboa, sparking discussion of what 
pieces might be applicable in the Brazilian context.  The 
failure of many of Brazil\'s past micro-credit efforts make 
improving access to such credit a special limus test.

1. (U)  Summary:  Brazil\'s President Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva visits China May 22 - 27, accompanied by a huge 
entourage of Ministers and business leaders, determined to 
put Brazil-China relations at the center of his quest for 
strategic alliances.  Trade and investment may be the most 
visible items on the agenda, but China figures prominently in 
the Lula administration\'s campaign to tighten relations with 
other like-minded regional heavyweights (i.e., India, South 
Africa), diversifying its foreign policy alliances and 
augmenting its own reputation on the world stage. 
Cooperative activities in science and technology, defense, 
tourism, environment, and agriculture, invigorated by the 
higher-profile exchanges within the last year, will likely 
benefit from a flurry of MOUs and agreements signed during 
the visit.  While the U.S. was Brazil\'s largest 
single-country export market in 2003, China came in third, 
nearly edging out neighbor Argentina, and has been buying 
even more this year.  The GoB seeks deeper trade ties with 
China, hopes to get its share of China\'s excess investment 
capital and would have more to lose from a cooling of China\'s 
economy than would many other countries.  At the same time, 
Mercosul and the PRC are discussing the initial phases of a 
free-trade agreement.  While Sino-Brazilian relations, 
political and commercial, are relatively young, there appears 
to be no shortage of Brazilian enthusiasm for overcoming the 
obstacles of inexperience in forging a stronger partnership. 
The question is whether the PRC shares Brazil\'s vision of an 
important strategic relationship, or prefers a marriage of 
convenience based on short-term interests.   End summary. 
 
The Trip of the Century 
----------------------- 
 
2. (SBU)  President Lula, who visited China once before 
becoming President, has characterized this trip as perhaps 
the most important of his government.  The sheer size of the 
delegation supports this assessment.  Lula will reportedly 
bring nine Ministers, at least five governors, and a business 
delegation of over 400.  The trip includes stops in Shanghai 
and Beijing.  In recent remarks to the press, Lula said he 
wants a \"relationship of equals without dependency\" with 
China and, in reference to the bilateral trade relationship, 
that Brazil needs to do more than just sell.  While 
expectations for greater trade and investment gains are high, 
the political optic for Brazil is not to be underestimated. 
Lula views his administration\'s foreign policy, and perhaps 
much of his personal legacy, in the context of 
coalition-building among developing nations.  In particular, 
the GoB considers China a partner in counter-balancing the 
influence of wealthier nations in multilateral institutions. 
In the lead-up to the trip, the administration has 
characterized Brazil and China as nations with much in 
common. 
 
 
Common Political Ground? 
------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) Perhaps no other non-western-hemisphere country 
figures more prominently in the GoB strategic calculus than 
China.  President Lula\'s visit to Beijing, following 
high-profile travel to India, South Africa and the Middle 
East last year, provides ample evidence of the 
administration\'s aims to build a formidable bloc of 
developing countries.  A key GoB focus is consensus building 
among like-minded countries for UN reform that would expand 
permanent membership of the UN Security Council - presumably 
to include regional powers such as Brazil.  Brazil\'s Foreign 
Ministry (MRE) perceives China, already a permanent UNSC 
member, as sympathetic to this GoB objective.  The MRE also 
believes the two countries share a \"political understanding\" 
concerning an emphasis on \"multilateralism\" and the need to 
counterbalance U.S. hegemony. 
 
4. (SBU)  President Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) has also 
discovered its own \"China card.\"  On April 23 in Beijing, PT 
President Jose Genoino signed a protocol of collaboration 
between the Chinese Communist Party and the PT.  According to 
press reports, Genoino affirmed that the GoB sought to 
construct a \"diplomatic, political, and economic axis\" among 
India, South Africa, Brazil and China.  He praised China\'s 
integrated public administration and said it was important 
for the PT to study what has occurred in China over the last 
twenty years.  Comment:  Genoino\'s visit should not just be 
viewed as a precursor to the President\'s upcoming trip.  The 
PT is likely also seeking to score points with Brazil\'s 
leftists, including those within the PT itself.  End comment. 
 
5. (SBU)  During recent UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) 
meetings in Geneva, Brazil was careful not to favor 
resolutions critical of China\'s human rights record, a 
position criticized by some editorials in the Brazilian 
press.  Brazilian diplomats claim they are not ignorant of 
the human rights situation in China.  The Chief of MRE\'s Asia 
and Oceania Division Oswaldo Biato indicated to poloff the 
GoB perceived China\'s human rights situation as \"serious but 
improving.\"  In any case, Biato noted, President Lula 
preferred to deal with this topic directly with his Chinese 
counterpart.  (In a side comment, he said the MRE would 
welcome any specific human rights information the USG could 
provide to be placed within the President\'s brief.)  However, 
other observers doubted very much whether in the swirl of 
excitement in the Great Hall, Lula would bring up the topic 
of human rights or whether, if he did, the Chinese would even 
deign to discuss the matter. 
 
6. (U)  Despite Brazil\'s multi-ethnic makeup, citizens of 
Chinese descent represent a tiny fraction of Brazil\'s 
population, compared, for example, to Brazilians of Japanese 
ancestry.  Illegal immigration and extradition may yet become 
an issue between the two countries.  The majority of the 
estimated 50,000 Chinese in Brazil, mostly residing in Sao 
Paulo, are believed to be in-country illegally. 
 
7. (U)  The GoB has also identified China as a major source 
of pirated goods entering the country.  To address Brazilian 
concerns about illegal immigrations and IPR, a legal 
cooperation agreement will reportedly be discussed during the 
visit.  A Brazilian Congressional investigation of IPR 
piracy, underway since June 2003, has highlighted the growing 
influence of the \"Chinese mafia\" in Sao Paulo\'s criminal 
network of contraband and pirated goods peddlers. 
 
8. (SBU)  Escola Euro-Americana Professor Ricardo Caichiolo, 
an expert on Chinese-Brazil relations, bemoaned to poloff the 
lack of understanding among Brazilians, even among so-called 
experts, of China.  Within the Foreign Ministry, Caichiolo 
believed that not one official can speak passable Mandarin 
(Caichiolo himself does not speak Chinese.)  Within Brazilian 
academia, he pointed to a paucity of Chinese Studies 
programs, although the University of Sao Paulo\'s and National 
University of Brasilia\'s own programs, he commented, were 
notable exceptions.  Academic exchanges are very few, due in 
part to the strong desire among the youth in both countries 
to seek English-speaking programs, according to MRE\'s Biato. 
However, he expects the development of exchange programs to 
increase following the visit. 
Trade and Investment 
-------------------- 
 
9. (U)  Despite poor communication, weak historic links, and 
divergent policy orientations, Brazil and China have recently 
made significant strides in expanding trade.  Commercial 
linkages which progressed slowly following the first 
bilateral accord in 1978 have boomed over the last three 
years.  China advanced from 12th place among Brazil\'s 
single-country export markets in 2000 to its third largest in 
2003, and its expansion continued in the first months of 
2004.  (Note:  The EU, counted as a single market, is 
Brazil\'s biggest trading partner, accounting for over U.S. 
$30 billion in 2003 trade compared to U.S. $26 billion with 
the United States.)  Brazil\'s trade with China in the first 
trimester of 2004 is already over 25 percent of Brazil\'s 
trade with the U.S. during the same period. 
 
10.  (U)  Note: While Brazil does not recognize Taiwan as a 
sovereign nation, trade is up approximately 20 percent with 
the island so far this year; total trade in 2003 was U.S. 
$676 million.  Brazil\'s trade data identifies Macao and Hong 
Kong as separate markets from China, as each has separate 
customs and tariff arrangements, although politically Brazil 
recognizes the two territories as falling under Chinese 
sovereignty.  Trade with Hong Kong totaled U.S. $944 million 
in 2003; trade with Macao was U.S. $7 million.  Brazilian 
exports to Hong Kong are up over 30 percent from last year. 
End note. 
 
11. (U)  The PRC is now Brazil\'s biggest trading partner in 
Asia, a bilateral relationship worth US $6.7 billion in 2003 
and projected by the GoB to rise to US $10 billion this year, 
not including Hong Kong and Macao.  Brazil enjoyed a US $456 
million trade surplus with China for the first trimester of 
2004, up from US $330 million during the same period in 2003. 
Emphasizing the mutual benefits of the growing trade 
relationship, Minister of Development, Industry, and Foreign 
Trade, Luis Furlan, confirmed to Chinese and Brazilian 
business audiences last month that both imports and exports 
have increased approximately 60 percent in the last trimester 
over the same period in 2003.  China\'s top exports to Brazil 
include transmitter parts, electronics, textiles, liquid 
crystal displays, computers, coal, electric motors and stereo 
equipment. 
 
12. (U)  Soybeans, iron ore and steel products accounted for 
approximately 75 percent of the value of 2003 Brazilian 
exports to China.  China is the largest buyer of Brazilian 
soy and iron ore, and the second largest importer of 
Brazilian steel.  Other top exports include cellulose and 
other wood products, laminated iron or steel sheets, leather, 
and automobile motors and parts.  While seeking to export 
higher value-added, manufactured goods to the Chinese, the 
GoB recognizes that China\'s demand for primary products like 
soy and steel currently drive the relationship.  The desire 
for uninterrupted supply of these primary-product exports 
will fuel the GoB-estimated US $5 billion of Chinese 
investment during the next three years in Brazilian mining, 
steel, transport infrastructure, energy and agribusiness. 
The Lula administration has launched an ambitious 
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative to help improve 
the country\'s woefully inadequate infrastructure using mostly 
private capital (ref A).  While the implementing PPP 
legislation still awaits final Congressional approval, the 
GoB would like to see PPPs used as the vehicle for some of 
the hoped-for Chinese investment. 
 
13. (U)   MRE\'s Biato told econoff of Chinese interest in 
further joint venture projects with Companhia Vale do Rio 
Dolce (CVRD), which could duplicate the success of Harbin 
Aircraft/Hafei Aviation\'s joint venture with Embraer to build 
regional jets.  CVRD plans to inaugurate a steel mill in the 
state of Maranhao in the coming months, the result of a 
Chinese joint venture with Baosteel Group.  CVRD is also 
discussing with Chinese investors exploration of a recently 
discovered copper mine in the same state.  CVRD 
representatives announced plans to build the world\'s largest 
solid cargo transport ship at a trade seminar last month, to 
deliver iron ore to China.  Brazil is a partner in the 
construction of the world\'s largest hydropower project at 
Three Gorges, and recent press reports have speculated on 
joint ventures in the farming and processing of soybeans as 
well as exploration of uranium deposits in Brazil. 
 
14. (U) Citing economic complementarities between the two 
countries, MDIC trade promotion officials interpret China\'s 
growing energy needs as offering great potential for 
innovative Brazilian technology -- flex-fuel technology, 
ethanol production and sales, hydroelectric machinery, as 
well as deepwater oil and gas sector know-how and equipment. 
Petrobras and the China National Petroleum Corp. have 
reportedly held talks on forming an oil exploration venture. 
The complementarity projections extend to China\'s need to 
invest its excess capital and Brazil\'s cash-starved 
infrastructure projects as well as the growing Chinese middle 
class\'s expected desire for increasing amounts of Brazilian 
meats, frozen chicken, orange juice, furniture, medical 
equipment and shoes.  The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture 
announced in February that Chinese officials had expressed 
interest in building railways, roads and other infrastructure 
in exchange for Brazilian soy, cotton and ethanol.  While the 
mechanics of such a barter arrangement would likely present 
problems for Brazil\'s private growers, the idea of investing 
in infrastructure projects linked to transporting commodities 
persists.  The Chinese Ambassador to Brazil recently told 
participants at a Brazil-China investment conference that 
China is studying the possibility of investing in road 
networks through Brazil to Pacific ports. 
 
15.  (U) In advance of the trip, both GoB and Chinese 
diplomats here are downplaying the decreased growth 
expectations of the Chinese economy, despite the significant 
effect that dampened demand for commodities like soy and iron 
ore would have on Brazil in particular.  Chinese officials 
prefer to spotlight the 2008 Olympics and the government\'s 
promise to raise the median income level and double GDP by 
2020, longer-term goals that a temporary economic slowdown 
will not heavily impact.  The Brazilians, in turn, do not 
appear concerned that the investment they seek might 
diminish, secure in their belief that Chinese financial 
authorities acting early will prevent a crisis. 
 
16. (U) Since few academics or public servants, let alone 
business people, are knowledgeable about China, the GoB 
argues that expanded bilateral trade, tourism, and cultural 
promotion efforts are the keys to solidifying and expanding 
mutually enriching exchanges.  In the run-up to Lula\'s visit, 
several high-level exchanges of trade and investment missions 
have laid the ground-work for the official inauguration of 
the Brazil-China Business Council (CEBC), an entity 
comprising representatives of China\'s and Brazil\'s largest 
and most successful companies.  The CEBC Co-Presidency will 
be shared between CVRD\'s President Roger Agnelli and China\'s 
Minmetal\'s President Miao Gengshu.  President Lula will 
inaugurate the CEBC during his visit. 
 
17. (U) In addition to the CEBC being an effective tool of 
business promotion, the GoB views it as the embodiment of 
both countries\' highest-level dedication to exploiting the 
other\'s untapped potential, ending a period of unintended 
benign neglect.  Along with the CEBC\'s inauguration, two 
match-making business seminars are slated for the 
accompanying 400-member business delegation: one in Beijing, 
the other in Shanghai.  While this business delegation is 
organized by the MRE\'s Trade Promotion Department, Biato 
explained that the CEBC will undertake activities across the 
two countries that official trade promotion agencies are too 
small and inexperienced to handle. 
 
18.  (U) APEX, Brazil\'s export promotion agency linked to the 
Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade, plans a 
mid-June trade mission to Shanghai focused on sectors 
identified by a private consultant as having the greatest 
export potential to China, including specialty coffees, 
software, cosmetics, gemstones, sports equipment, wine and 
biotechnology products.  A Chinese business delegation from 
Shanghai Sugar, Cigarettes and Wine plans to visit Brazil 
next week for meetings with over 50 Brazilian makers of 
retail items of interest to China\'s wealthy, a reverse trade 
mission organized by APEX. 
 
19. (U) In March, Brazilian news outlets reported that 
China\'s WTO Ambassador, Sun Zhenyu, had announced the 
country\'s desire to explore the possibility of a free trade 
agreement with Mercosul, as well as with South Africa, Chile, 
Australia and New Zealand.  He highlighted China\'s ongoing 
trade agreement discussions with ASEAN and several individual 
Asia nations.  After a visit to Beijing in April, Brazilian 
Foreign Minister Amorim announced that Mercosul and China 
would initiate the project of a free trade agreement in May. 
Mercosul is currently pursuing a wide-ranging FTA with the 
EU, but has initiated limited preferential trade agreements 
(PTA) with India and South Africa as precursors to broader 
future agreements.  The agreement with China would also 
likely start as a PTA focused on gradual tariff reductions 
for negotiated sets of products of interest to each party. 
The Lula administration\'s emphasis on strengthening 
Mercosul\'s global reach complements its designs to lead the 
block of developing nations in the multilateral trade arena. 
Brazil counts China among the founding members of the G-20 
and expects high-level Chinese participation at the June 2004 
UNCTAD meeting to be held in Sao Paulo. 
 
Bilateral Cooperation Efforts 
----------------------------- 
 
20. (SBU) Science and Technology: Brazil\'s cooperation with 
China in science and technology fields (ref C) has expanded 
in recent years, most notably with the China-Brazil Earth 
Resources Satellite program (CBERS).  In October 2003, the 
second of a series of 4 satellites was launched from a base 
in northern China.  The satellites are equipped with cameras 
to monitor environmental and natural resource indicators. 
CBERS has paved the way for partnerships in space research. 
Further discussions regarding energy cooperation, including 
renewable and nuclear, are likely during the visit.  (Note: 
Brazil\'s nuclear program has been the focus of recent 
attention due to pending issues regarding the Additional 
Protocol of the NPT and the yet-to-be agreed safeguards at 
one Brazilian nuclear facility. End note.)  In April, the two 
countries inaugurated a Sino-Brazilian software center in the 
northeastern Brazilian state of Paraiba.  The TecOut center 
will provide specialized services for the creation and 
international marketing of software products, including 
market studies and product adaptations.  The visit will 
likely spawn similar joint initiatives. 
 
21. (SBU) Defense:  The Brazilians will explore opportunities 
to expand mil-mil cooperation.  Military contacts indicate 
that while the military relationship is growing via 
familiarization visits and training exchanges, military sales 
between the two countries are unlikely, insisting that 
defense is not a driving force in the relationship.  Defense 
Minister Viegas visited China in November 2003, but he is not 
expected to accompany the President on this trip. 
 
22.  (U)  Tourism:  MRE officials portray tourism cooperation 
as contributing to expanded trade and investment, citing the 
fact that Chinese tourism is on the rise worldwide, 
accounting for the third largest number of non-European 
tourists to visit Europe last year. According to Brazilian 
press reports, the Chinese government will soon announce a 
change in its visa policy to encourage more tourism -- 
Chinese will be able to travel to Brazil without obtaining an 
exit visa. 
 
Agricultural Trade and Cooperation 
---------------------------------- 
 
23. (U)  Minister of Agriculture Rodrigues\' visit to China 
last November and Chinese Vice Agriculture Minister Fan 
Xiaojian\'s visit to Brazil that same month produced import 
certifications for Brazilian beef, phytosanitary protocols, 
and technical exchanges designed to ease difficulties in 
certifying the sanitary suitability of a range of 
agricultural products including citrus, chicken, and pork. 
Last month President Lula and Chinese Vice Premier Hui Langyu 
signed a preliminary agricultural commodities accord aimed at 
eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers.  Despite the 
professed goodwill, Chinese soy concerns over properly 
identified biotech varieties and quality issues like 
excessive humidity, aflatoxin, damaged grains, and impurities 
continue to occasionally hamper Brazilian soy exports.  Only 
after considerable negotiation did China accept Brazil\'s 
export certificates regarding biotech content, as the GoB had 
not approved the use or safety of biotech soy for its own 
consumers but expected the Chinese to accept the GoB safety 
certification based on the claim that the Brazilian variety 
is the same as those grown in Argentina and the U.S., which 
have both been accepted by China. 
 
24. (U) While these obstacles may in part mask broader 
Chinese concerns over food security and an over-reliance on 
imports, GoB officials expect progress on more binding 
farm-commodity agreements during the visit.  Representatives 
of the Brazilian meat exporters association, ABIEC, will join 
the business delegation to China seeking direct sales to 
mainland China to augment established relationships with 
importers in Hong Kong.  ABIEC\'s current President is former 
Agriculture Minister Pratini de Moreas.  Cooperation 
agreements on biotech and fisheries research are under 
discussion, and there is reportedly Chinese interest in 
Brazil\'s booming farmed shrimp industry.  (Note: Both Brazil 
and China, along with four other shrimp exporting nations, 
are currently the targets of an on-going U.S. anti-dumping 
investigation.) 
 
Comment:  Too Much Hype? 
------------------------ 
 
25. (SBU)  The number of Chinese high-level visits to Latin 
America, along with growing trade, suggest that China is not 
discounting the region as it continues to open its markets 
and expand its own influence, even if economic growth cools. 
Brazil, with the region\'s largest economy and biggest 
population, figures prominently in that context.  There is, 
however, a lot of ground to cover before achieving the kind 
of strategic partnership that the GoB envisions.  Does 
China\'s current administration seek to change the geopolitics 
of trade with a formula compatible with the GoB\'s?  In a 
relationship among equals, disagreements are aired, but it 
seems unlikely that trade irritants, not to mention weightier 
topics such as democratization and human rights, will figure 
prominently during this visit.  Perhaps social issues 
affecting both countries, such as HIV/AIDS, social 
inequalities, and poor income distribution will figure on the 
agenda. Even if the political bond is immature, there are 
sufficient financial interests to move the relationship 
forward and this visit should showcase them.  For the 
Brazilians, even a marriage of convenience (as opposed to 
commitment) is preferable to a perpetual date.

SUBJECT: DEATH BY A THOUSAND BITES: MUNICIPAL LEVEL 
CORRUPTION IN BRAZIL 
 
REF: BRASILIA 1055 
 
      1.  (SBU) Introduction and Summary:  In recent months, 
Brazil\'s press has focused intently on municipal-level graft 
and corruption. Many of the horror stories are being planted 
by the Federal Comptroller General\'s (CGU) office that is 
conducting random audits and inspections of many of Brazil\'s 
5,560 municipalities. Based on the CGU\'s own investigations, 
severe corruption is identifiable in over two-thirds of the 
municipalities inspected while most of the rest have 
significant accounting \"irregularities.\" The financial impact 
from the local \"fire ants\" on Brazil\'s social and economic 
health is staggering. While the CGU campaign is commendable, 
there is no evidence yet of a GOB action plan to attack local 
level corruption. End summary 
 
      ------------------------ 
      A Plague of Fire Ants... 
      ------------------------ 
 
      2.  (U) Thanks to high profile press events by Brazil\'s 
Federal Comptroller General\'s (CGU) office, municipal level 
corruption is receiving wide press attention. In a recent 
edition, Brazil\'s largest circulation newsmagazine \"Veja\" 
headlined \"A National Plague, Corruption and Ineptitude 
Devour More Than 20 Billion Reals a Year.\" Using the analogy 
of an epidemic of fire ants, the story listed by name a 
plethora of corrupt mayors, city councilpersons, and other 
local officials throughout the country who misappropriated 
federal resources destined for their municipalities.  The 
total is huge. Over 107 billion reals (about USD 38 billion) 
from the federal budget were appropriated in 2003 for 
Brazil\'s 5,560 municipalities -- a level that has risen 
almost 70% since 1995.  Of this amount, at least 20 billion 
reals is estimated to have disappeared last year through 
corrupt or inept behavior. 
 
      3.  (U) Examples of malfeasance among Brazil\'s 
municipalities are being widely publicized in the Brazilian 
press. While high profile alleged corruption cases, such as 
that of former Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf (who announced 
last week that he was running again for the Sao Paulo 
mayorship) may measure graft in the hundreds of millions of 
reals, it is corruption at the very local level that is 
increasingly coming under public scrutiny, particularly 
through the CGU municipality inspection lottery.  Every 
six-eight weeks the CGU randomly selects 50 municipalities 
for immediate fiscal audit of programs financed with federal 
resources, either through federal agencies or direct 
transfers to state and municipal-level administrative 
entities. The inspection process began in 2003 and has 
revealed local corrupt behavior that was always assumed but 
rarely spotlighted. 
 
      4.   (U) Recent revelations indicate that the impact on 
Brazil is enormous. Daily newspaper \"Jornal do Brasil\" 
described how a corrupt official in Bahia had converted 
federal funds into \"royalties\" to companies for road projects 
that were never constructed. Taking funds destined for 
providing power lines for farmers, one mayor managed to have 
a third of the grid built on his farm.  When queried, he 
responded, \"I have half a dozen cows. I am a citizen equal to 
anyone else. Should I stop being mayor in order to build a 
power line on my farm?\" An account in \"Veja\" told of a mayor 
in the Northeastern state of Para who in just six months and 
during three visits to the state capital to collect his 
municipality\'s federal appropriation, managed to be \"robbed\" 
on each occasion for a total of 360,000 reals. Other examples 
of corrupt behavior included double payments on contracts, 
overbilling, phantom corporations, extra bonuses for local 
officials, nepotism, bounced checks, diversion of public 
money directly into personal accounts, personal use of 
official vehicles and fuel, bribery, and false accounting 
practices.  Failure to complete already funded infrastructure 
projects is common. 
 
      5.   (U) The Federal Comptroller General identified 
extensive malfeasance and mismanagement at the local level. 
After completing audits of 200 municipalities, the CGU 
identified 139 (70%) as being severely corrupted.  Only seven 
(3.5%) were deemed as both \"clean and accurate,\" while the 
rest exhibited accounting \"irregularities.\"  CGU inspections 
also revealed widespread failure of community councils, 
created to provide local oversight over programs, to fulfill 
their mandate. In most cases, councils were constituted only 
formally but never held meetings, let alone conduct actual 
public oversight. Impartiality within the councils was rare. 
Many council members, often municipal employees, were 
selected by the same mayors responsible for the use of 
federal funds. 
 
      6.   (U) The greatest level of malfeasance appears in 
Brazil\'s impoverished North and Northeast. GOB Comptroller 
General Waldir Pires confirmed a close link between 
\"political backwardness\" (common in Brazil\'s Northeast and 
North) and corruption. As an example, he noted that CGU 
audits of just a small number of Northeastern municipalities 
in just one month identified the diversion of 17.7 million 
reals (about USD 6 million) from SUDENE (the Northeast 
Development Superintendency), an agency that was finally 
disbanded for endemic corruption and ineffectiveness. 
 
      ----------------------------- 
      ...A Plague of Councilpersons 
      ----------------------------- 
 
      7.   (SBU) Brazil\'s federal system also deserves some 
blame for this state of affairs.  Brazil\'s town halls receive 
about 15% of all tax receipts as opposed, for example, to 
Mexico\'s 3%. Former Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega 
believes that Brazil\'s mayors in fact access even more funds, 
perhaps 40% of the country\'s total tax receipts -- money for 
which they have no legal right or responsibility. Meanwhile, 
there are more mayors and city councilmen at the trough than 
ever before. Since the early 1990s, more than 1,000 
municipalities have been created, many with no legal, 
economic, or social justification.  The country has had to 
sustain 60,276 local councilpersons. A recent decision by 
Brazil\'s Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) reduced this number 
nationwide by 8,500 -- a step, many believe, in the right 
direction. Congress, however, is fighting to pass a 
Constitutional amendment that would raise the number above 
the new 51,700 level (reftel). 
 
      8.   (SBU) Comment:  While it is impossible to prevent 
all the fire ants from taking bites out of the public purse, 
the CGU\'s inspection campaign is having a positive impact by 
documenting both specific cases and the extent of the 
problem, thus making corruption a topic of discussion 
preceding municipal elections in October. With the CGU 
inspections, evidence of malfeasance is not lacking. But 
identification of corruption is only part of the battle. 
Successful prosecutions are needed.  Though the CGU claims it 
sends many cases of malfeasance to federal prosecutors, 
prosecutions have not yet occurred. The Lula administration 
deserves credit for highlighting municipal level corruption 
but there is no evidence yet of a GOB action plan to attack 
the problem with effective prosecutions or resistance to 
political acts (such as the efforts to re-establish thousands 
of council positions) that can create conditions for local 
corruption.

SUBJECT:  POWER FUTURE 2004 ENERGIZES NGOS, GOB, AND PRIVATE 
SECTOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PLAYERS 
 
 
1. Summary.  Power Future 2004, a trade fair and seminar on 
renewable energy technologies, was held April 27-29, 2004 in 
Fortaleza, Brazil.  Organized by Brazil\'s Renewable Energy 
Network of Non-governmental Organizations (RENOVE) with 
USAID/Brazil support, the event allowed private and public 
sector participants to exchange ideas on a wide range of 
issues critical to the future of Brazil\'s growing renewable 
energy market.  In addition, the event provided an excellent 
opportunity for equipment and service providers, financial 
institutions, and project developers to establish the 
partnerships that will allow them to effectively compete for 
contracts under Brazil\'s Renewable Energy Incentives Program 
(PROINFA).  The event was a major success, attracting over 
2,000 participants and 40 local and international 
exhibitors, including five U.S. corporations.  Preliminary 
reports indicate that it resulted in direct sales, service 
contracts, and business partnership proposals valued as high 
as USD 100 million. 
 
PROINFA 
------------- 
 
2.  The PROINFA Renewable Energy Incentive Program, 
established in 2002 during the Cardoso administration, has 
been endorsed by the Lula government and is moving forward 
as designed.  It guarantees the government purchase of 3,300 
megawatts of power from renewable energy sources - 1,100 MW 
from wind, 1,100 MW from small hydro and 1,100MW from 
biomass - over the next two years, with the goal of 
stimulating the renewable energy market while increasing 
power generation from renewable sources by 50%.  The PROINFA 
program also requires that 10% of total installed electrical 
generation capacity be derived from renewable energy sources 
by 2026. 
 
3.  Eletrobras recently called for proposals for the first 
installment of the government purchase of 3,300 MW of 
renewable energy.  The corresponding contracts should be 
signed by May 31, 2004, as PROINFA legislation requires that 
this first set of projects be operational by the end of 
calendar year 2006.  The GoB anticipates that the PROINFA 
program will generate USD 3 billion in renewable energy 
investments over the next two years and create more than 
150,000 new jobs. 
 
POWER FUTURE 2004: Content, Concerns, and Results 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
---------- 
 
4. USAID/Brazil originally proposed the idea of a renewable 
energy trade fair and conference to one of its key 
implementing partners, RENOVE, as a means to stimulate 
investment and improve cooperation between the government 
and the NGOs and private companies working in the renewable 
energy sector.  NGOs, corporations, developers, and 
investors responded enthusiastically, making Power Future 
2004 Brazil\'s largest ever renewable energy trade fair.  The 
event generated a healthy debate over the design and 
implementation of the PROINFA renewable energy incentive 
program, and raised the following key points of concern: 
 
- Project developers expressed great disappointment over a 
PROINFA policy that places a generation ceiling of 220 MW on 
single energy sources (wind, hydro, or biomass) in any given 
state.  Technical experts and project developers argued that 
this action will result in inefficient utilization of 
natural resources throughout the country.  For example, in 
the coastal state of Ceara where strong winds are a 
constant, wind farms represent an extremely viable and 
financially attractive source of renewable energy.  However, 
the 220 MW single-source ceiling could result in PROINFA 
awarding contracts for a number of far less promising 
programs in Ceara; the same will be true in other states 
where a given source of renewable energy is particularly 
well suited.  Seminar participants argued persuasively for 
allowing technical and regional considerations to determine 
the appropriate mix of renewable energy sources.  The 
renewable energy community is hopeful that this message will 
lead the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) to reconsider 
its position on PROINFA program energy source ceilings. 
 
 
- Private sector representatives expressed concern over MME 
actions to control PROINFA energy pricing.  After the first 
public hearing in July of 2003, MME unilaterally reduced the 
purchase price for renewable energy, failing to adequately 
address production costs and other market considerations. 
 
- Private sector representatives argued that conditions 
established for GoB financing through the Brazilian Bank for 
Social and Economic Development (BNDES) are unacceptable. 
High interest rates, excessive loan guarantee requirements, 
and an overly bureaucratic application process were some of 
the obstacles identified during the seminar. 
 
5. Limited participation by the MME at Power Future 2004 
also raised concerns.  The ministry sent a representative to 
the event, who was more often than not unable to respond to 
concerns and questions, particularly with respect to the 
PROINFA program. 
 
6. Participation in Brazil by the U.S. renewable energy 
industry remains relatively modest.  The majority of 
international investors in the sector come from European 
countries, notably Germany, Portugal, and Spain.  However, 
this situation appears to be changing, as five U.S. 
equipment suppliers actively participated in Power Future 
2004 events: GE Energy, Clipper Wind Power, Woodward, 
Cummins, and Caterpillar. 
 
7. One noteworthy outcome of Power Future 2004 was the 
creation of a partnership between Clipper Wind Power, a 
California-based firm, and a local company based in 
Sorocaba, Sao Paulo, for the manufacture of turbine blades 
and towers in Brazil.  Another achievement was the further 
strengthening of RENOVE, a key contributor to USAID/Brazil\'s 
strategic focus on mitigating global climate change through 
the promotion of viable alternative energy technologies and 
energy efficiency.  Power Future 2004 also resulted in 20 
new organizations and businesses joined Brazil\'s largest 
renewable energy association, which now has over 40 members. 
This group is fast developing into a formidable voice for 
positive policy reform in the energy sector.  Moreover, it 
is leading a nation-wide effort to advance renewable energy 
technology as the one of the best options for improving the 
quality of life and economic opportunities for the estimated 
12-15 million Brazilians that currently lack access to 
reliable power.

SUBJECT: AFTER 500 DAYS, THE QUESTION IS:  CAN LULA GOVERN? 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Donna Hrinak, reasons 1.4 B),D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  Lula\'s man-of-the-people rhetoric and 
heartfelt commitment to social progress quickly captured 
imaginations inside Brazil and abroad, but practical results 
of his first 500 days in office have been far less  soaring. 
Without better economic news, stronger executive capacity and 
a firmer political base, his GoB may find itself falling into 
a crisis of governance by the second half of his term. 
Lula\'s fiscal and monetary policies have been all that the 
market wanted, but he has reaped no visible domestic rewards 
yet in the form of new growth, jobs, income or investment. 
His administration\'s executive ineptitude, and the ramshackle 
nature of its coalition alliances, are further factors that 
both contribute to and are themselves worsened by the 
economy\'s non-recovery so far.  We expect pressure on Lula to 
mount further, with a fair chance he will feel forced to move 
to New-Deal-style spending programs in 2005.   END SUMMARY. 
 
The Personal Aura 
----------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Lula\'s charismatic initial impacts, and his triumph 
in gaining market confidence after Brazil\'s 2002 crisis, have 
entered history as the first chapter of his presidency. What 
next?  With more than a third of that presidency now past, 
his personal popularity is a healthy 60%, defying Brazil\'s 
absence of new growth and jobs, even if down from his 
high-80\'s of a year ago.  Financial markets and institutions 
continue to lavish him with praise for the GoB\'s orthodox 
monetary/fiscal management.  His constant foreign travel and 
diplomatic activism garner a high profile and mainly positive 
image worldwide, bolstering his and Brazil\'s claims to 
international leadership and thus appealing to nationalists 
on left and right.  He has banked much good will on which to 
draw at home and abroad in terms of what he indisputably 
represents for Latin-American democracy and social 
aspirations.  His comportment shines out as that of an 
uncorrupt, democratic, inclusive, charismatic but unassuming, 
down-to-earth negotiator.  Yet Lula finished his first 500 
days in office at his lowest domestic political ebb to date. 
What is the problem? 
 
The Real Economy 
---------------- 
 
3. (SBU) First and foremost, it\'s the economy.  Brazil\'s 
macro-economic stabilization since 2002 has been a continuing 
true triumph of Lula\'s political will.  He persistently 
endorses Meirelles\' and Palocci\'s strict inflation and 
budget-surplus targets through 2005.  Plainly, he has been 
won by the argument that fiscal/monetary loosening would risk 
forfeiting the gains that the Plano Real -- and especially 
the last year\'s sacrifices under the PT -- have brought 
Brazil.  But palpable real-world results for Brazil\'s 
citizens have remained absent, and for Lula henceforth there 
will be no substitute for more growth, jobs, income, 
investment.  Some recent data are positive, and forecasters 
concur that 3-3.5% GDP growth this year is likely.  But they 
also generally agree that 3-3.5% will have only a marginal 
effect on jobs and income, and that that rate is unlikely to 
strengthen through 2006. 
 
4. (SBU) Plus there are new economic concerns in the shape of 
outside uncertainties: Chinese demand, Fed interest-rate 
policy, the oil-price trend.  These have helped erode the 
exchange rate by 10% since April.  Further weakening could 
produce a halt - or even a reversal -- of the year-long 
decline of Brazil\'s benchmark SELIC interest rate.  That in 
turn would hit the growth rate and might prevent the expected 
reduction in the debt/GDP ratio this year, which would be a 
truly crippling portent for Meirelles/Palocci. 
 
5. (SBU) Brazil\'s external financial vulnerability is greatly 
down since 2002, thanks to superior current-account trends 
and GoB debt-management.  Still, the market is not Brazil\'s 
friend.  If last year\'s benign global atmosphere were to 
shift, Brazil could fall to investor-herd fears despite its 
own best efforts.  And those efforts, in the present climate 
of GoB political shakiness and inept governance, are far 
short of what they could be. 
 
Executive Ineptitude 
-------------------- 
 
6. (C) Shaky leadership is an over-arching problem.  Lula 
remains the undisputed arbiter of GoB policy differences, but 
his limitations are not being mitigated by the so-called 
\"hard nucleus\" of his closest Planalto advisors.  On the 
contrary, this group of long-time Lula friends and PT 
veterans - e.g., Secretary General Luiz Dulci and Secretary 
of Government Communication and Strategic Management Luiz 
Gushiken - evidence no strategic vision or decisive executive 
competence.  The one standout, Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu, 
was a virtual prime minister during the administration\'s 
first year, managing most key initiatives and coordinating 
congressional strategy.  But his dramatic diminishment by the 
Diniz scandal has rendered Dirceu much less effective, 
leaving a vacuum that has sucked coherence and energy out of 
Planalto. 
 
7. (C) Lula\'s executive problem extends through 
senior-personnel ranks.  His first, tortuously drawn-out 
cabinet reshuffle has produced no rejuvenating results.  And 
the process of installing new faces in ministries is still 
underway as part of Lula\'s coalition-reinforcing efforts, to 
the further detriment of efficient policy-making.  Not by 
accident, those policy areas with the relatively best records 
under Lula - trade, macroeconomic, industrial, agricultural - 
are run almost entirely by non-PT ministers he appointed at 
the outset.  Yet he has shown no readiness since then to 
reach out for expert talent beyond the PT. 
 
8. (SBU) Meanwhile, ideological currents still run deep 
through the PT grass roots and into its senior echelons. 
Finance Minister Palocci\'s enlightened fiscal views are the 
exception:  many, perhaps most of Lula\'s old allies still see 
the state as the main, natural, legitimate actor for directly 
implementing programs for national progress.  At worst, this 
mindset has spawned fresh barriers to investors in the shape 
of GoB regulatory-agency and energy-model legislation.  More 
generally, we suspect it causes Lula\'s GoB not to really know 
its own mind about its agenda.  As former President Cardoso 
recently quipped:  \"I suppose the government must have a 
plan, but I cannot figure out what it is.\" 
 
 Ramshackle Political Base 
------------------------- 
 
9. (C) In the Congress, Lula has slipped backwards.  His 
ability to push legislation depends on the unity of an 
unwieldy, PT-led coalition which includes parties that are 
all over the map in terms of ideology and seriousness.  On 
paper the coalition is ample enough to carry the day on most 
votes, but in reality fragmentation and rebellion are 
becoming the norm.  The Diniz scandal, together with 
unhappiness on the right with lack of growth and on the left 
with lack of progress on the touted social agenda, brought 
Lula a major legislative defeat in early May.  More may come. 
 The fragile coalition is barely held together by Lula\'s 
charisma and promises of pork and government jobs.  Passage 
of his pension and tax bills in 2003 hinged on support from 
opposition parties, and he may hope to reach out more in 
future to the PSDB, which is likeminded on  various platform 
issues.  But this will further dilute coalition discipline 
and the efficacy of legislation produced by barter. 
 
10. (SBU) At the local level, GoB/PT prospects in October\'s 
municipal elections have faded.  The PT has always been an 
urban party (its mayors run 10 of Brazil\'s largest cities but 
only a tiny percentage of smaller municipalities), and early 
in the Lula government there was PT hope for a breakthrough 
bandwagon effect.  After the administration\'s last four 
months of difficulties, however, PT leaders are no longer 
willing to predict large gains and are digging in for tough 
challenges to party incumbencies, notably Sao Paulo, where a 
loss would be iconic for Lula and the PT. 
 
11. (C) Foreign policy is one area which Lula and his 
diplomats doubtless view as one of unalloyed triumph.  In 
reaching for a weightier world role, they have mirrored 
previous Brazilian ambitions.  The outcome of the Cancun WTO 
talks, the dilution of the FTAA process at Miami, the 
formation of the G-20 Group, have had no downside, in their 
view.  But much of what Itamaraty portrays as Lula\'s personal 
impact on the world scene is plain fanciful, e.g., his 
grandiloquent plan for a tax on arms transactions to go into 
a hunger-relief fund.  And his foreign policy and travels may 
hold future risk for his image, e.g., if Venezuela goes 
critical or if Itamaraty doctrinaires ultimately stymie FTAA 
negotiations. 
 
The Next 500 Days 
----------------- 
 
12. (C) It is not easy to see Lula making a strong recovery 
in his next 500 days.  Conversely, it is not hard to envision 
further political and economic slippage.  Worst-case:  if 
Lula\'s domestic political standing worsens, and external 
economic developments turn bad, Brazil could be back within 
months to a deteriorating economic/financial spiral. 
More-likely case: growth picks up modestly and Brazil avoids 
external economic buffets, but there still is little sense of 
new momentum or relief through year\'s end.  If either of 
these scenarios combines with a poor PT election result, what 
might be Lula\'s political and policy follow-on? 
 
13. (C) Lula\'s orthodox economic policy remains exactly what 
most outside observers have counseled, but he and the PT are 
unlikely to soldier on with it indefinitely, absent palpable 
returns.  This would be especially the case if an external 
shock sparks a \"hot-money\" investor flight that could be 
perceived as confiscating the gains of Brazilians\' past 
sacrifices.  Should GDP not pick up convincingly by 
year\'s-end, arguments for a policy adjustment from \"Herbert 
Hoover\" policies towards \"Roosevelt New Deal\"-style 
public-works employment, with a priority on useful 
infrastructure projects like railroads and water-treatment, 
may become hard to resist. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
14. (C) Are Lula\'s struggles just a spring slump, or a 
presage that his team is headed for a losing season? 
Arguably, no party fresh like the PT to national power could 
have made a fast start in a nation like Brazil, less than 
twenty years emerged from dictatorship, with its primitive 
and corrupt feudalities, undisciplined and unprincipled 
political parties, and inadequately-established state 
institutions generally. 
 
 15. (C) Lula-backers can still hope that Brazil\'s GDP growth 
this year will be sufficient to ease social pressures; that 
the PT will do well enough in October\'s elections to solidify 
its coalition; that the President will thereafter recruit new 
ministers and key figures, re-launch his legislative program 
at the start of 2005, and, learning from past missteps, make 
an expeditious success of the further reforms vital for 
Brazil\'s economy to break through and attain its long-term 
potential.  The glum alternative opinion is that he and the 
PT already are showing they lack the personnel, platform, 
party, political power, and general conditions to carry out 
their transformational \"project\" for Brazil, period.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL: BILATERAL POL-MIL TALKS 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Richard Virden, Reasons 
1.4 (b) 
& (d) 
 
1.   (C)  Summary and Introduction:  Annual U.S.-Brazil 
Political-Military consultations, held in Brasilia, May 14, 
reflected general accord on the health of the bilateral 
pol-mil relationship but identified areas where collaboration 
and coordination remained thin.  USdel head P/M Assistant 
Secretary Lincoln Bloomfield Jr. offered to help close the 
 
SIPDIS 
gap on outstanding issues, particularly where specific 
written agreement that would facilitate expanded cooperation 
was lacking.  While the A/S acknowledged that ties between 
the two militaries were strong, such agreements, he said, 
would enhance them more. Brazilian officials, led by Foreign 
Ministry (MRE) Director General for North and Central America 
and the Caribbean Ambassador Washington Pereira, welcomed 
U.S. clarification on such matters as Article 98, a proposed 
Defense Cooperation Agreement, GSOMIA, and ACSA, but conceded 
little in bringing any negotiated agreement closer to 
closure.  Looking at the regional situation, the Brazilian 
side highlighted bilateral efforts with Colombia, Venezuela 
and Bolivia, but stopped short of implying a more active 
political engagement with Colombia (unless specifically 
requested from the GoC.)  Focusing on its upcoming 
peacekeeping mission to Haiti, the GOB asked that the USG 
assist that country\'s post-Aristide political leadership to 
reach out to pro-Aristide elements and Caricom.  Regarding 
Brazil\'s F-X jet fighter competition, A/S Bloomfield made an 
indirect pitch for the Lockheed-Martin F-16 by noting 
continued AMRAAM availability for the U.S. package.  The F-X 
decision process, according to the Ministry of Defense, now 
rests with the Presidency. The GOB side expressed reluctance 
for any significant change to the mission of regional 
security instruments such as the InterAmerican Defense Board 
and the OAS Committee on Hemispheric Security.    End Summary 
 
 
DCA & SOFA 
---------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  In order to achieve the unmet potential in the 
current mil-mil relationship, A/S Bloomfield explained how a 
defense cooperation framework agreement (DCA) would be a very 
practical tool for facilitating cooperation in several 
defense areas such as exchanges, training, and joint 
exercises.  He shared with the GOB a non-paper explaining the 
purpose of a DCA as well as a SOFA, identifying the elements 
contained in the latter.  The U.S. side stated that a SOFA 
was necessary for entry into a DCA.  The A/S offered to send 
USG experts to explain both types of agreements and, in so 
doing, to clarify the differences between the two. 
Ambassador Pereira was open to the possibility of a DCA but 
remained skeptical that the Brazilian Congress would approve 
a SOFA because of Constitutional concerns.  However, he 
acknowledged that since the SOFA applied only to discrete 
groups of U.S. servicemen, the issue could still be left open 
for internal GOB review.  Ministry of Defense (MOD) Director 
for International Affairs Air Force General Carlos Velloso 
also welcomed the Assistant Secretary,s suggestion for 
exploratory talks.  Velloso noted that discussion of a SOFA 
would go beyond the purview of just the Defense and Foreign 
Affairs Ministries, and include the Ministry of Justice among 
others; the A/S replied the same holds true for the U.S. 
side, insofar as Brazil wants to discuss reciprocal 
treatment. 
 
GSOMIA 
------ 
 
3.  (SBU)  General Velloso indicated that the Ministry of 
Defense had already begun review of the draft General 
Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) 
facilitating the exchange of classified military information. 
 While the MOD wanted an agreement, Velloso stated that a 
number of \"restrictions and caveats\" have been voiced within 
the Ministry about \"illegal\" USG requirements (Note: Velloso 
subsequently downplayed, then dismissed, the notion of 
illegal requirements. End note).  As a result, the review 
process within the Ministry had ground to a halt.  He 
promised the MOD would continue to review the agreement to 
see what is feasible.  OSD Senior Country Director for Brazil 
Luiz Sanchez replied that over 60 countries, including five 
in the Western Hemisphere, had already signed GSOMIAs with 
the U.S.  In every case, no such \"legal\" concerns had been 
voiced by the parties. Sanchez said the USG would appreciate 
Brazil,s specific concerns. He also offered to arrange a 
GSOMIA orientation visit to the U.S. as a confidence building 
measure to alleviate MOD concerns, a proposal welcomed by the 
MOD. 
 
ACSA 
---- 
 
4.  (SBU)  General Velloso recognized the importance of 
signing an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) 
in support of Brazil\'s upcoming PKO mission to Haiti. 
However, he pointed to several legislative hurdles that had 
to be addressed before Brazil could sign it.  For example, 
Brazilian Law 8666, he said, did not allow for \"cross 
servicing.\"  According to Velloso, several passages within 
the ACSA may need to be deleted or modified.  Again, Sanchez 
noted that 47 nations already have ACSAs in place, including 
six in South America.  Sanchez reiterated the rationale for 
an ACSA and asked whether the MOD understood its routine, 
non-binding nature.  Again, the U.S. side requested Brazil,s 
specific concerns and suggestions. 
 
Article 98 
---------- 
 
5.  (U)  A/S Bloomfield explained that while there is 
profound feeling behind the USG rhetoric, U.S. policy sought 
neither to undermine the ICC/Rome Statute nor to be punitive. 
Moreover, the USG, he pointed out, is not looking to harm its 
military assistance programs, which serve our interests as 
well.  The American Servicemen\'s Protection Act, however, was 
a clear effort to use assistance as leverage to dissuade 
countries from joining the Rome Statute, and the USG would 
enforce the law.  Noting that 89 Article 98 agreements had 
already been concluded (over half with countries that have at 
least signed the Rome Statute), Bloomfield said the USG is 
comporting with the Rome Statute by following the Article 98 
procedure.  While the USG recognizes Brazil,s strong 
advocacy for accountability and responsibility, the A/S made 
clear we do not recognize the ICC\'s jurisdiction over U.S. 
citizens. Moreover, he emphasized, the threat to U.S. 
citizens of politicized prosecution has been shown to be a 
real world phenomenon. 
 
6.  (C)  MRE United Nations Division Deputy Chief Achiles 
Zaluar responded that the MRE was gratified the Bush 
administration wanted to avoid a confrontation over Article 
98.  The ICC, Zaluar noted, enjoys considerable public 
support in Brazil, and the GoB believes the Court is an 
important international institution.  Brazil did not want to 
give the impression international law automatically did not 
apply to some countries.  Moreover, Zaluar said, the U.S. 
Article 98 model agreement appeared to exempt all U.S. 
nationals and not just sent persons.  \"Things would be 
different if we were talking only about USG officials and 
soldiers,\" he pointed out, \"but a blanket condition for all 
U.S. citizens could be detrimental if (this policy was) 
applied by all countries to the ICC.\"  Brazil,s extradition 
stance, he argued, was similar to the EU,s and the GoB could 
offer \"additional guarantees\" if that would alleviate USG 
concerns.  He stated that Brazil would extradite to the 
United States before the ICC and urged the USG in its 
dealings with Brazil to think \"out-of-the-box.\" Ambassador 
Pereira proposed the GoB continue to study the issue with the 
clarifications that the UGS provided. 
 
Intelligence Sharing /\"3 1\" TBA Cooperation 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  MRE Illicit Transitional Crime Division Chief Marcos 
Pinta Gama shared USG optimism about bilateral intelligence 
and law enforcement cooperation, pointing out that Brazilian 
agencies benefit greatly from cooperation with counterpart 
USG agencies.  He cited extensive information exchange on 
crime, drugs and anti-terrorism and specifically praised the 
bilateral, Embassy-led Law Enforcement Working Group (LEWG), 
established in 2003.  Pinta Gama did refer to a State 
Department website citing \"financial support\" from the TBA 
for terrorist groups and asked that such a determination be 
\"better established.\"  He described the \"3 1\" mechanism as 
instrumental in showing the reality in the TBA and the 
challenges faced there.  Pinta Gama also suggested that Chile 
and Uruguay be added to the \"3 1\" Group.  MRE\'s crime chief 
felt that additional bilateral cooperation and more fluid 
threat information exchange could be achieved between 
Brazilian civil aviation authorities and the TSA, 
particularly in the absence of armed air marshals in Brazil. 
 
Regional Challenges 
------------------- 
 
8.   (C)  MRE South America Division Chief Rubem Barbosa 
provided an overview of the state of Brazil,s neighbors, and 
Pinta Gama reviewed Brazil,s border monitoring coordination 
efforts with its Andean neighbors. Regarding Colombia, the 
GoB remained concerned with possible spillover effects.  To 
improve tactical cooperation, Presidents Uribe and Lula 
established a bilateral working group to exploit the 
information gleaned from SIVAM, now completely operational. 
Pinta Gama praised the work of the Regional Intelligence 
Center in Tabatinga which monitors the flow of drugs along 
the Colombian border.  Brazil, Barbosa stated, perceived 
significant political progress under Uribe and remained 
\"moderately optimistic\" about that country\'s prospects.  He 
reiterated Brazil,s offer to host a meeting between the UN 
and the insurgents, if the GoC concurred.  A/S Bloomfield 
asked how Brazil could play an even more constructive role in 
Colombia.  Barbosa emphasized the GoB would not \"impose its 
views\" on the Colombian people.  Brazil would lend more 
active participation, he said, if it were welcomed by the 
Colombians themselves.  Brazil wanted a clear signal or 
indication for its broader involvement and would only act if 
Bogota specifically requested its assistance. 
 
9.  (C)  Brazil shares its longest and most porous border 
with Bolivia. Ambassador Pereira said the GoB viewed with 
\"grave concern\" the \"seismic changes\" occurring in Bolivia, 
including the disturbing convergence of an energized 
indigenous movement with the drug problem. Pereira 
underscored the Brazil\'s unshaken support for President Mesa 
and President Lula,s efforts to keep Morales on a democratic 
path. Brazil, he said, was also doing everything it could to 
prevent Bolivia,s economic collapse and warned that 
\"moderation\" had to continue.  Barbosa explained that Brazil 
continued to work with Venezuela on a wide range of issues 
including trafficking-in-persons and cross border drug 
trafficking.  However, Venezuela must respect democratic 
principles and move towards a democratic solution -- a stance 
the Lula administration continued to demand of Chavez. 
Barbosa opined that Lula,s close ties with Chavez helps to 
\"moderate\" the Venezuelan leader. 
 
PKO/HAITI 
--------- 
 
10.  (C)  Zaluar announced that the bill authorizing Brazil\'s 
participation in the Haiti peacekeeping operation had just 
passed the Chamber of Deputies, adding that President Lula 
personally had been involved in the process.  (Note: The bill 
passed the Senate on May 19. End note)  Brazil, he explained, 
wanted Haiti,s underlying social and development issues to 
be addressed during this UN operation, and the international 
community, and especially the U.S., should provide generous 
financial support.  The MRE believed that Haitians had turned 
to drug trafficking only when there was no other viable 
economic alternative after international assistance was cut 
off.  Pointing to continued repercussions from President 
Aristide\'s departure from power, Zaluar urged the U.S. to 
press Haiti\'s current leadership to reach out to Caricom and 
the pro-Aristide forces.  Caricom support, he felt, was vital 
to a political solution and so far, the new leaders seemed 
not to have a good understanding of the regional context of 
the Haiti situation.  A/S Bloomfield expressed USG 
appreciation for Brazil\'s decision to lead in this important 
hemispheric operation, and the United States understood the 
need for the country\'s economic and social development.  He 
said he would carry the message regarding the behavior 
towards pro-Aristide elements and Caricom back to Washington. 
 
Defense Modernization Programs 
------------------------------ 
 
11.  (SBU)  One of Brazil\'s most important military 
modernization efforts is the new generation F-X fighter 
program.  General Velloso indicated that the long-running F-X 
competition process had progressed from the Air Force through 
the MOD to the Presidency where a decision on the selection 
of the F-X had not yet been made.  The Ministry of Defense 
remained closely engaged with the Presidency, the General 
assured, and its technical imput on the fighter options was 
being weighed carefully.  A/S Bloomfield emphasized that the 
USAF\'s principal interest is not commercial but rather to 
sustain a close, long-term relationship with the Brazilian 
Air Force, which is held in high regard among the US 
military.  Regarding authorization to release the AMRAAM 
missile as a part of the U.S. F-16 package, the USG had 
confronted and overcome old attitudes in the U.S. Congress 
because \"the partnership with Brazil was a greater interest 
even than our regional proliferation concerns.\"  Amazon 
Surveillance System (SIVAM) Commission Vice President Air 
Force General Alvaro Pinheiro stated that with the opening of 
the Manaus command center, SIVAM was \"completely 
operational.\"  He cited continuing spare parts issues with 
Raytheon, although he conceded there were no more \"technical 
problems.\"  Southcom J-5 Brazil Desk Officer LTC Sam Prugh 
indicated that the USG supported greater regional sharing of 
radar data to develop a complete, seamless picture that would 
better protect Brazil\'s borders. 
 
Special Conference on Hemispheric Security 
------------------------------------------ 
 
12. (SBU) MRE OAS Division Chief Nelson Tabajara praised the 
successful outcome of the Special Conference, including the 
Declaration on Security in the Americas (DSA).  He described 
the DSA as evidence of the historical evolution of 
hemispheric security issues within the OAS. To reach 
consensus on such a significant document, a lengthy 
preparatory process was indeed necessary.  In Brazil,s 
opinion, the DSA correctly emphasizes threats beyond simply 
traditional territorial confrontations.  Tabajara concluded 
by asserting that the Declaration serves as both a guide and 
a starting point because future work, including perhaps 
additional conferences, will be needed to bolster hemispheric 
security.  Eli Sugarman from the Office of Regional and 
Strategic Security, Bureau of Arms Control, echoed Brazil,s 
position and emphasized the need to move forward with 
implementation of the DSA.  Sugarman also agreed that 
continued consultations are needed to discuss concrete ways 
to implement the more action oriented provisions of the DSA. 
 
Confidence and Security Building Measures (CSBMs) 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
13. (SBU)   Sugarman stated that one of the most significant 
outcomes of the Special Conference on Security was the 
creation of a permanent OAS \"Forum for Confidence and 
Security Building\" to consider new measures and review 
implementation of past ones.  The U.S. hopes to use this 
Forum to consider a \"new generation\" of CSBMs to address 
emerging transnational threats of the 21st century.  Tabajara 
agreed that the pursuit of a new generation of non-military 
measures is important.  Since original measures have 
succeeded in considerably lowering mistrust, he felt a new 
generation of measures could continue this momentum and 
further promote stability and military transparency in the 
hemisphere. 
 
OAS Committee on Hemispheric Security (CHS), 
    General Assembly Resolutions 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
14.   (C)   Tabajara affirmed that Brazil was satisfied with 
the work of the CHS, and he highlighted Brazil,s recent 
draft resolution on combating extreme poverty as a security 
concern for Brazil and others.  Sugarman stressed the need 
for a more effective CHS Chair next year to ensure that the 
CHS is able to fulfill its numerous mandates, including those 
related to Special Conference follow-up.  The process of 
introducing resolutions also ought to be reconsidered, he 
added. For example, although the U.S. supports Brazil\'s 
resolution on extreme poverty, we were caught by surprise 
when it was introduced at the last minute without prior 
consultation.  Sugarman,s reference to a U.S.-drafted 
resolution on Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) 
surprised the Brazilians because they were unaware that such 
a draft resolution was being considered.  Sugarman explained 
that further consultations were needed before the draft would 
be formally introduced. He concluded by suggesting a series 
of regular (quarterly) consultations between the U.S. and 
Brazilian OAS delegations to ensure better coordination on 
hemispheric security issues. 
 
Inter-American Defense Board Modernization 
------------------------------------------ 
 
15.  (SBU)   The Inter-American Defense Board (IADB), A/S 
Bloomfield stated, should be part of a new array of effective 
and relevant regional security institutions, and the U.S. 
favors a range of proposals to modernize it.  The U.S. 
military, he noted, is increasingly called to perform 
nontraditional tasks, such as providing advice to outgunned 
police forces faced with heavily-armed organized crime 
elements. Yet, the OAS lacked the expertise to assist in 
large measure because it cannot call upon the IADB for help. 
The USG recognizes, however, that making changes to the IADB 
is a consensus matter for its members.  Among the proposed 
reforms, the A/S pointed to a proposal to divide the Board 
into subunits for hemispheric security responsibilities and 
for traditional defense. 
 
16.  (SBU) MRE OAS Division Chief Nelson Tabajara responded 
that while the GoB also supports the IADB, it is skeptical 
about the benefits of reforming the Board.  While sympathetic 
to USG concerns, the GoB, believes the IADB serves a unique 
role in the region by providing a forum to discuss 
traditional military tasks and its mission should not be 
\"diluted.\"  New threats where there are no single paradigms 
or solutions, should be accommodated through \"new mechanisms 
and assets...on a case by case basis\" depending upon the 
threat, Tabajara explained.  The A/S acknowledged that the 
two countries differ on their perceptions how to utilize the 
IADB.   MOD Vice-Admiral Murillo Barbosa acknowledged the 
increase in non-traditional tasks undertaken by the Brazilian 
military, including Amazon development, counterdrug 
operations, and assistance to the Rio de Janeiro police. 
However, he seconded Tabajara,s point about preserving the 
IADB as a forum for defense issues focusing on \"traditional\" 
threats. 
 
Comment 
------- 
17.  (C)  While the upcoming Haiti PKO was the principal 
issue on the minds of Brazilian interlocutors during the 
talks, within the Brazilian delegation there appeared to be a 
disconnect between the PKO mission and the need for various 
agreements, such as a GSOMIA and an ACSA, to be in place to 
assure the mission\'s effectiveness and success. We believe 
our message may have sunk in.  Subsequently, we have learned 
that the MRE has approached various diplomatic missions in 
Brasilia, inquiring about their governments\' respective 
agreements with us. As Brazilian peacekeepers arrive in 
Haiti, we may see movement on these agreements.  Finally, 
while the Brazilians no doubt came away with a better 
understanding of issues of major importance to us, such as 
Article 98, they conceded little except their stated 
intention to continue reviewing these topics. 
 
18.  (U)  Assistant Secretary Bloomfield has cleared this 
message.

SUBJECT: GRAB BAG OF GOB INDUSTRIAL POLICY MEASURES 
 
Refs: A) Brasilia 1098  B) Brasilia 661 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1. (U)  Summary:  As promised, Minister of Development, 
Industry and Trade (MDIC) Luis Furlan unveiled a huge composite 
of measures under the umbrella of Industrial, Technology and 
Foreign Trade Policy (PITCE in the Portuguese acronym) on March 
31.  A grab bag of recycled programs, financing and tax 
incentives as well as new councils and government agencies, the 
PITCE comes with promises to modernize, restructure, and 
streamline the broken pieces of government that hamper 
industrial growth.  Attractively wrapped in technological 
innovation, the PITCE offers something for everyone (plus a 
little extra for the four strategic sectors of semiconductors, 
software, pharmaceuticals and capital goods) while attempting 
to appear sufficiently different from the discredited 
industrial policies of Brazil\'s past.  Fiscal constraints 
necessarily limit the viability of the various options, but the 
GoB has already budgeted R$ 550 million (US$ 183.3 million) for 
2004.  Furlan and his deputies insist that PITCE is not static 
and will be altered when necessary to fit the country\'s 
development needs.  Their assertion parallels Itamaraty\'s often- 
voiced reluctance to commit to any multilateral trade 
obligations that would limit GoB flexibility in this sphere. 
End Summary. 
 
Everything But The Kitchen Sink 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (U)  On its web site, MDIC defines over 50 industrial policy 
measures under the headings of a) industrial modernization, b) 
foreign markets & competitiveness, c) product, process, and 
management innovation, d) strategic options for semiconductors, 
e) software, f) capital goods and g) pharmaceuticals, h) 
harbingers of the future, i.e. biotech and nanotech i) 
strengthening small and medium enterprises, j) strengthening 
the national system of innovation, and k) creating a favorable 
environment for industrial development.  Each listing includes 
a definition of the measure, a goal and a responsible 
government entity to lead the effort.  With such broad 
parameters, existing programs are easily folded, or slightly 
modified to fit, into the PICTE. 
 
3. (U)  Under foreign markets and competition, export-promotion 
publicity campaigns executed by the Ministries of Tourism, 
Culture and Foreign Relations constitute a specific measure. 
The program \"Brazil Exporter,\" launched in November 2003 by 
MDIC and also a PICTE measure, is itself a collection of 
assistance efforts aimed at getting small businesses to export 
via training, improvements in product design, and greater 
access to credit.  The PICTE broadens the Brazil Exporter 
program to include specific measures for Brazilian states 
underrepresented in the export market as well as a new drawback 
system that would partially reimburse import duties on goods re- 
exported or used in manufacture of exported goods.  Expanding 
the application of special computerized customs procedures to 
include semiconductors, and efforts to reinvigorate the 
metrology network and certification programs under the 
supervision on INMETRO (The National Institute of Metrology, 
Standards and Industrial Quality) for paper, cellulose and 
furniture industries, exemplify the relatively low-cost PICTE 
goal of redirecting the efforts of bureaucratic structures to 
accommodate sectors the GoB believes have greater export 
potential. 
 
4. (U)  Modernizing customs policies and procedures, 
facilitating the opening and closing of businesses, creating 
MDIC-led competitiveness forums for biotechnology and 
franchising, as well as development of a broad extension 
service designed to assist smaller businesses to export their 
products, typify the horizontal measures that account for much 
of the PICTE\'s efficiency and transparency goals.  The plan 
also calls for installation of foreign trade and investment 
attraction kiosks within the international branches of the Bank 
of Brazil, as well as the creation of five distribution and 
logistics centers overseas to support the efforts of small and 
medium-sized export businesses. 
 
5. (U)  The PICTE spawns more policymaking, calling for the 
development of specific industrial-policy programs for 
nanotechnology and biomass.  The PICTE prioritizes the passage 
of several bills including innovation legislation, which would 
create a legal framework for privately conducted research to be 
funded through government resources and, in some cases, using 
government labs.  Passage of a bill (1787/96) protecting the 
intellectual property of lay-out designs of integrated 
circuits, a TRIPS requirement that has lain dormant in the 
Brazilian Congress for several years, is now an objective of 
the Lula administration.  Digital inclusion and the free 
software movement also figure in the policy.  Incentives will 
be designed for the development of software solutions using 
open code, and the GoB plans to add 30,000 to the network of 
computer-using small businesses by 2007. 
 
Potentially Affecting the Bottom Line 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U)  At least eight of the PITCE measures are concrete tax 
or concessional financing incentives, the most broad being the 
\"Modermaq\" program which offers fixed-rate 5-year financing for 
up to 90 percent of the sale price of industrial-equipment 
purchases.  In addition to Modermaq, the PICTE includes a 
reduction of the import tax on some capital goods without 
locally or Mercosul-produced equivalents.  (Note:  Brazil 
grants case-by-case reduced tariff rates on specialized capital 
goods not produced locally.) This reduction of the exceptional 
tariff rates from 4 to 2 percent for goods produced within 
Mercosul and to zero for goods not produced within Mercosul 
began with the implementation of a resolution in February 2004. 
The GoB characterizes the equalization of the COFINS (social 
security system contribution) tax on imports and exports 
(reftel A) and the gradual elimination (starting with a 30 
percent rate reduction in 2004) of the industrial production 
tax (IPI) on equipment destined for productive activity as 
PICTE measures as well.  A Presidential decree (no. 4,928/03) 
of December 2003 permits reductions in the calculation of the 
net profit taxes (CSLL) for businesses that invest in 
technological research and product development. 
 
7. (U)  The meat of the benefits for the four strategic sectors 
are Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) lines of credit for 
software marketing and export; pharmaceutical production, 
research activities, business incorporation, acquisition and 
fusion; and the purchase or production of made-to-order capital 
goods.  The line of credit for semiconductor production will 
come from the Ministry of Science and Technology\'s (MCT) FINEP, 
the Ministry\'s financing arm for studies and projects linked to 
sector specific funds.  2004 financing under these credit 
schemes ranges from R$ 10 million for chips to R$500 million 
for pharmaceuticals and capital goods. 
 
More or Less Bureaucracy? 
------------------------- 
 
8. (U)  The PICTE calls for the creation of a National Council 
of Industrial Development as well as a Brazilian Agency for 
Industrial Development. While both are to be organized by MCT 
and MDIC, the Council would bring together government, business 
and labor to help define policy directives, and the Agency 
would concentrate the execution of policy objectives in one 
government organ.  In addition, the PICTE envisions a one-stop- 
shop for potential investors that would also develop the agenda 
for sector-specific investments.  Called the \"Special Room for 
Attracting Investment,\" this permanent group directly linked to 
the Presidency would bring together representatives of the 
Ministries of Development, Foreign Relations, Finance, 
Planning, Mines and Energy, Agriculture, Science and 
Technology, Tourism, and the Civil Household. 
 
Government-run Labs 
------------------- 
 
9. (U)  Several PICTE objectives aim to create new public 
laboratories, and to modernize existing ones.  While several 
are specific to the pharmaceutical sector, including a new 
national factory for the production of blood tests and vaccines 
and a laboratory for nuclear medicine research and production, 
others would focus on metrology and biotechnology.  A planned 
national public laboratory for chemical metrology would 
establish a certification framework to judge the purity of 
chemical products, and a national laboratory for material 
metrology would set national standards for building materials 
such as ceramics and carbon fiber products.  The National 
Laboratory of Industrial Technology will develop projects and 
promote research in applied micro and nantechnology in 
partnership with businesses and the function of the 
Biotechnology Center of the Amazon, inaugurated in 2002, will 
be strengthened to better assist businesses with sustainable 
harvesting of biotech production for commercial purposes.  The 
policy recognizes that bringing successful innovations to 
market will require strong intellectual property protection, 
especially in the target areas of pharmaceuticals, software, 
nanotech, and biotech.  Therefore, the restructuring of the 
Brazilian Patent Institute (INPI) and improving the regulation 
of ANVISA, the Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency, are key 
PICTE measures that require further elaboration (septel). 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) The PICTE is nothing if not ambitious in scope, and 
it endeavors to encompass parts of the GoB\'s total development 
agenda, even social priorities in health and education through 
digital inclusion and expanding production at public labs. 
Inclusive, modern, nationalist, populist, this policy offers 
something to every constituent.  By promoting industrial growth 
and efficiency via incentives to invest in new technology and 
export, particularly high-value added goods and services, the 
real prize the Lula administration seeks is job growth. 
Fostering cutting-edge technological development in the 
innovative sectors of the future and correcting bureaucratic 
bottlenecks is the icing on the cake that appeals more to the 
business than labor crowd. 
 
11. (SBU)  Above all, the set of measures which Lula\'s GoB is 
cumulatively presenting as its industrial policy is manifestly 
crafted to avoid significant new budget outlays or adverse 
policy impact.  The designers of the PICTE creatively aim to 
accomplish its specific goals with minimal fiscal distress, 
chiefly by re-modeling existing structures and supplementing 
the energy of the private sector.  While there are some clear 
import-substitution goals, especially in pharmaceuticals, 
petroleum and gas production, the plan introduces no overtly 
protectionist quotas or tariff hikes.  Those measures that 
require substantial public investment like the creation of new 
public laboratories may necessarily be longer-term goals, 
despite Brazil\'s world-class research capabilities, due to the 
tight fiscal environment.  MDIC\'s Secretary for Production, 
Carlos Gastaldoni has frankly characterized the PICTE to us as 
part standard operating procedure and part wish list.  He 
considered the Modermaq program as the most significant in 
short-term impact, characterizing the access to capital at a 
fixed rate as one of the biggest hurdles small Brazilian 
businesses face.  He noted that the strong emphasis on 
technological innovation should help guarantee a dynamic policy 
that can respond to industry\'s evolving needs. 
 
12.  (SBU)  The GoB\'s industrial-policy ideology has a trade- 
policy dimension.  Lula\'s administration considers its freedom 
to intervene with government supports as potentially essential 
for Brazil\'s industrial progress.  Any proposal -  presented in 
the context of free trade or not -- that might hem in this 
ability is rebuffed as an effort to deny an indispensable 
right, a right that, GoB interlocutors often remind us, more 
developed economies have freely exercised in the past. 
Brazilian recognition that the positives and negatives of 
globalization have significantly altered governments\' toolkit 
of viable options plainly influenced this leftist GoB\'s 
supposedly improved version of national `industrial policy.\' 
The result aims to be a hybrid applicable to Brazil\'s local 
realities, but also compatible with existing trade commitments. 
In practice, its impact in the internal sphere is likely to 
remain muted.  There is far too little in GoB coffers to 
significantly subsidize chosen industries and too much reliance 
on trade earnings for this GoB to repeat wholesale the statist 
policy errors of the nation\'s 1950s\'-1970s\' past.  For current 
and future trade negotiations, however, industrial policy goals 
will continue to limit what the GoB views as in its interest 
for further liberalization in sectors such as services, 
government procurement, investment and IPR.

1. (C)  The chief of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry\'s OAS 
Division (MRE/DEA), Nelson Tabajara, told Poloff on 28 May 
Brazil was \"surprised\" by recent negative developments in 
Venezuela and has not formulated an official response. 
Tabajara said the \"inflamed\" environment has raised the GOV\'s 
\"level of insecurity\" to such an extent that no one can 
predict Chavez\'s next moves. 
 
2. (C) Tabajara said Brazil\'s Ambassador to Caracas had 
recommended Brazil not/not provide MRE or other official 
observers to this weekend\'s \"reparos\" process. (Note. We were 
unable to confirm this with the MRE\'s Andean Division Chief. 
End note.)  Tabajara said the GOB expects the appeals process 
to move forward 28-30 May, and said Brazil will \"react 
strongly and with the U.S.\" if there are irregularities. 
Tabajara noted also that the upcoming OAS General Assembly 
will provide a forum for Brazil and others to take positions 
in light of events. 
 
3.(C) Poloff asked Tabajara about 25 May press reports 
indicating President Lula da Silva\'s strong concern about the 
formation of pro-Chavez militias.  Tabajara was not aware of 
any recent intercessions by President Lula da Silva or FM 
Amorim with the Chavez government on the militias or the 
signatures appeals. 
 
4. (C) Comment. On the eve of this important weekend, we 
believe that the GOB will fulfill its Friends obligations in 
the event of a melt down in Venezuela.  But we also doubt 
that the GOB has a contingency plan for decisive bilateral 
engagement with Chavez.  Repeated queries over the past 
several weeks to candid and informed MRE interlocutors (refs) 
reveal anxiety but also a seemingly fatalistic approach -- at 
least at the professional working level -- to a matter that 
should be of high strategic concern to Brazil.  We cannot 
judge whether confidential caveats have been registered by 
the GOB with Chavez in recent days, but we doubt it.  If the 
situation does go critical, Lula could well pick up the phone 
to Chavez, but we are not confident that the GOB has a ready 
script for such a call, or that the message would be potent 
enough for meaningful impact.

U.S. 
 
REFS: A) Brasilia 1097 B) Brasilia 76 C) 2003 Brasilia

1. Summary:  Brazil has five antidumping (AD) 
investigations open against the U.S. and applies AD 
measures against five U.S. origin products.  The 
products concerned are largely chemicals used in 
industrial applications.  A safeguard measure against 
imported toys, extended in December 2003 until the end 
of 2004, also applies to the U.S.  End summary. 
 
CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS 
---------------------- 
 
2.  Out of a total of 28 current cases worldwide, 
Brazil has commenced five antidumping (AD) 
investigations against the U.S. since September 2003, 
two of which are five-year sunset reviews of pre- 
existing AD cases.  All of the cases target chemical 
products used in industrial processes and finished 
goods with a wide range of applications.  The current 
status of each case and a product description, gleaned 
from www.petrochemistry.net, follow. 
 
A.  Polycarbonate resins, five-year sunset review 
initiated on 9/11/2003.  However, the review was 
suspended by a court decision on 12/17/2003 pending a 
final judicial determination.  Polycarbonate resins, 
derived from bisphenol A, are used for structural 
parts, impact resistant glazing, street-light bulbs, 
household appliance parts, components of 
electrical/electronic devices, automotive applications, 
reusable bottles, food and drink containers, optical 
media devices (CD/DVD) and medical applications.   It 
is also a building block used to make epoxy resins for 
coatings, electrical laminants, composites and 
adhesives. 
 
B.  Ethyleneglycol monobuthyl ether (a.k.a. 
buthylcellosolve), case initiated 11/10/2003 (ref D); 
On-site verification of local industry in process from 
May 2-4 and 11-14.  This ether is used in cleaning 
products, preservatives, and as a fixative for 
perfumes, germicides, bactericides, insect repellents 
and antiseptics.  It is also used as an additive for 
jet fuel to prevent ice buildup. 
 
C.   Polyvinyl chloride - (PVC), five year sunset 
review initiated 12/15/2003 (ref B), GoB currently 
awaits clarification and complementary information 
regarding the responses to the questionnaires.  PVC is 
a polymer of vinyl chloride used to make a diverse 
range of cost-effective products with various levels of 
technical performance suited to a wide range of 
applications.  Many of these PVC products are used 
everyday and include everything from medical devices 
such as medical tubing and blood bags, to footwear, 
electrical cables; packaging, stationery, and toys. 
 
D.   PET resins (Polyethylene tereftalate), case 
initiated 03/03/2004 (ref C); GoB awaits responses from 
questionnaires sent 03/05/2004 through 05/14/2004. 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is derived from xylene 
and is one of the most widely used industrial 
polyesters.  It is used in lightweight, recyclable soft 
drink bottles, as fibres in clothing, as a filling for 
anoraks and duvets, in car tire cords and conveyor 
belts.  It can also be made into a film used in video, 
audio and x-ray. 
 
E.   Methyl methacrylate (MMA), case initiated on 
04/23/2004 (ref A).  GoB awaits responses to 
questionnaires sent 04/28/2004 and due by 06/09/2004. 
Methyl methacrylate is a chemical derived from 
propylene, used for the manufacture of polymethyl 
methacrylate and also for polymer dispersions and other 
resins. 
 
CURRENT AD AND SAFEGUARD MEASURES 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  Brazil applies AD measures on 31 products from 
several countries, and has three safeguard measures in 
effect on toys, shredded coconut and powdered milk. 
There are currently five AD measures in place against 
U.S. products, in addition to the safeguard measure on 
toys applied to the U.S. and many other countries.  The 
AD margins and/or price agreements are applied to four 
chemical products and one pharmaceutical, and are as 
follows: 
 
A. Polycarbonate resins, AD duty of 19%, expires 
07/26/2004. 
 
B. Hydroxyethyl cellulose - (HEC), AD duty 19.8%, 
expires 04/19/2005. 
 
C. Medicine containing insulin, petitioners and 
exporters reached a price agreement, expires 
03/06/2006. 
 
D. Phenol, AD duty 41.4%-68.2%, expires 10/16/2007. 
 
E. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), AD duty 16%, duty will 
continue to be applied during the review mentioned in 
paragraph 1C. 
 
4.   The safeguard measure on toys, an additional 10% 
above the 20% tariff, was extended until 12/31/2004 
late last year.  The measure has been in effect since 
1996, and was extended one additional year instead of 
two as allowed by WTO rules for developing countries 
(maximum of ten years.) 
 
5.  Comment:  A trade specialist at the Ministry of 
Development, Industry and Foreign Trade\'s Commercial 
Defense Division explained the preponderance of 
chemical products in Brazil\'s AD cases against the U.S. 
He noted that the chemical industry worldwide is a non- 
stop business highly dependent on scale. Inventories 
grow rapidly during times of low seasonal demand, and 
the excess inventory is then exported at very low 
prices.  As a result, countries where the chemical 
industry is relatively small will tend to have a high 
percentage of AD cases on such products.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL ARRESTS MAJOR TRAFFICKER OF PIRATED GOODS 
 
Refs:  A) 2003 Sao Paulo 2199  B) 2003 Brasilia 3564 
 
1.  SUMMARY: Brazilian Federal Police arrested June 1 one of 
the country\'s biggest pirated goods smugglers, Law Kin Chong, 
and his lawyer Pedro Lindolfo for corruption, conspiracy to 
commit bribery, conspiracy involving organized crime 
(racketeering) and disrupting the functioning of a 
Parliamentary Investigative Commission (CPI).  Chong, through 
his lawyer, allegedly attempted to bribe Piracy CPI President 
Deputy Luiz Medeiros (PL-SP) with US$1.5 million to avoid being 
mentioned in the CPI\'s final report.  The lawyer was 
apprehended in Medeiros\' Sao Paulo office offering the deputy 
US$75,000 as the first installment of the bribe.  Both Lindolfo 
and Chong were transferred to Brasilia June 3 for security 
reasons and await formal hearings.  Chong, owner of three 
popular shopping malls in downtown Sao Paulo, is said to be the 
head of a contraband mafia that is responsible for the 
trafficking of a significant portion of pirated goods in 
Brazil.  The Piracy CPI has targeted Chong for months, and took 
him in for questioning in November 2003 (ref A).  End Summary. 
 
2.  The Chamber of Deputies\' Parliamentary Investigative 
Commission on Piracy (CPI) scored a major bust on Tuesday, June 
1 with the arrest of Law Kin Chong, a Chinese businessman 
(naturalized Brazilian).  Chong owns three shopping centers in 
downtown Sao Paulo selling mostly pirated goods and is thought 
to lead a major smuggling ring in Brazil.  According to press 
reports, Chong\'s lawyer was arrested in the Sao Paulo office of 
CPI President Deputy Luiz Medeiros on June 1 with the US$75,000 
he offered to Medeiros as the first installment of a US$1.5 
million bribe to keep Chong out of the CPI\'s soon-to-be- 
released final report.  Chong himself was arrested an hour 
later in a Sao Paulo parking lot, reportedly trying to flee to 
Paraguay. 
 
3.  Medeiros told the press that the Federal Police had been 
monitoring exchanges among Chong, his associates and Medeiros 
for over a month, initiated when Chong offered to assist the 
CPI by providing information.  Medeiros arranged a meeting with 
Chong\'s lawyer during which the bribe was offered in the 
presence of Medeiros\' security guard, a Federal Police officer. 
Medeiros did not refuse the bribe, alerted the Federal Police, 
and had subsequent meetings in Sao Paulo with Chong and/or his 
associates that were taped by the Federal Police.  Chong and 
Medeiros reached a final agreement May 29 for US$1.5 million to 
be paid in five installments. 
 
4.  After the June 1 arrests in Sao Paulo, the two suspects 
were transferred to Federal Police custody in Brasilia, 
reportedly for security reasons.  Police seized computers, 
documents and millions in U.S and Brazilian currency from 
Chong\'s accounting office and currency-exchange business, all 
to be examined at Federal Police headquarters in Brasilia.  The 
lawyer handling Chong\'s defense told journalists that he would 
request the repeal of Chong\'s arrest and seek a writ of habeaus 
corpus (injunction or stay) if the request is denied. 
 
5.  Chong has been the target of several investigations over 
the last seven years, according to press accounts.  Widely 
believed to be the biggest smuggler in the country, he 
reportedly has ties to authorities throughout the government 
and was involved with judge Rocha Mattos, currently under 
investigation for corruption, as well as federal police 
officials arrested during Operation Anaconda, a big corruption 
sting operation carried out last year (ref B, para 9).  He is 
also under investigation for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The CPI targeted Chong last year, raiding two of his shopping 
centers and bringing him in for questioning in November 2003. 
Despite closure of the stores ordered by the Department of 
Investigations of Organized Crime (DEIC) following the raid, 
Chong obtained court orders forcing the reopening of the stores 
and the return of all seized merchandise.  Chong was also 
quickly released (ref A).  The CPI had scheduled a public 
hearing on their final report for June 3, but delayed the event 
until June 8 in view of the Chong arrest. 
 
6.  Comment:  The timing of the arrest serves to highlight the 
work of the CPI as it nears closure later this month.  It will 
likely be more difficult for Chong to quickly and fully escape 
unscathed from this arrest due to the CPI\'s spotlight of public 
scrutiny and the hard evidence against him, but he has shown he 
has the wherewithal to get high-level officials to weigh in 
heavily in his favor.  Some Sao Paulo IPR contacts have already 
expressed doubt that he will remain in custody or that the 
charges against him will stick.  Mission will continue to 
follow the case as well as developments regarding the CPI.  End 
comment. 
 
7.  This message was coordinated with Consulate Sao Paulo.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S PRISONS IN STATE OF CRISIS 
 
REF:  A)Brasilia 1073 
 B)Brasilia 011 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  The three-day rebellion in Benfica 
Prison in Rio de Janeiro ended May 31, taking place 
six weeks after the gruesome rebellion in the Urso 
Branco prison in Brazil\'s western Rondonia state.  The 
two uprisings were not isolated events, but rather are 
manifestations of the crisis in Brazil\'s penitentiary 
system.  There are simply not enough cells to 
accommodate all 308,000 prisoners in Brazil.  Beyond 
overcrowding, prisons also face poor sanitary 
conditions, disease, abuse of prisoners, corrupt 
prison guards and officials, and a shortage of 
funding.  The government needs to invest more in 
n 
building new prisons, but the current priority is 
spending on policing and combating crimes. 
Strengthening the penitentiary system would be part of 
a broader security package aimed to create reasonable 
security, health and sanitary conditions inside 
prisons.  The GoB plans to disburse R$180 million 
(about USD 60 million) for security upgrades decided 
upon by state governments.  END SUMMARY. 
 
RIO\'S BENFICA REBELLION 
----------------------- 
2.  The May 28-31 Benfica uprising was the second 
longest-lasting rebellion ever in the state of Rio de 
Janeiro.  Thirty inmates and one guard were killed and 
fourteen inmates were injured.  According to Rio\'s 
Prison Director, Astirio Pereira dos Santos, the 
rebellion began as a battle between rival gangs (Third 
Command vs. Red Command) that went out of control due 
to lack of proper security measures.  The Coordinator 
of the Prison Community Council, Marcelo Freixo, 
pointed out that mixing the different gangs was 
\"explosive\".  At the time of the uprising, there were 
more than 800 prisoners in the prison; at least 14 
escaped, three of whom were recaptured.  An 
evangelical pastor with experience working in prisons 
joined the negotiations and ended the impasse when he 
persuaded the inmates to free twenty-one hostages. 
Afterward, human rights NGOs were not allowed into the 
institution.  Benfica may be the worst uprising in 
Brazil since the notorious 1992 massacre in Sao 
Paulo\'s Carandiru prison left 111 inmates dead.  The 
Getulio Vargas Foundation reports that the profile of 
prisoners in Rio de Janeiro is 97% male, 52% in their 
twenties, 67% black, and 43% with less than seven 
years education.  Out of 3,300 prison guards in the 
state, only 1,400 work directly with prisoners, of 
whom there are more than 20,000 (the population has 
doubled in the last five years). 
 
URSO BRANCO UPRISING 
-------------------- 
4.  A gruesome April 16 uprising in the Urso Branco 
(\"White Bear\") prison in Porto Velho, the capital of 
Brazil\'s western Rondonia state, carried a similar 
message about the crisis in the Brazilian penitentiary 
system (ref A).  On April 16, hundreds of prisoners 
rebelled and expelled the guards from the prison, 
keeping 167 hostages (mostly women who had been 
visiting inmates).  During the five-day rebellion, 
fourteen prisoners died, and masked inmates standing 
atop the walls were photographed throwing body parts 
of dismembered victims over the walls.  These victims 
were prisoners said to be informers or unwilling to 
cooperate with the rebellion\'s leaders.  The prisoners 
were demanding better conditions, and after five days 
Rondonia state Governor Ivo Cassol gave in to most of 
their demands.  The widely broadcast images of the 
brutal rebellion, and Governor Cassol\'s concessions, 
sparked public debate over prison conditions in 
Brazil. 
 
OAS TAKES BRAZIL TO TASK 
------------------------ 
5.  This was not the first outbreak in Urso Branco. 
Some 80 inmates have been killed in riots there over 
the last three years.  In 2002, 27 prisoners were 
killed during a rebellion that began as an escape 
attempt (ref B).  After that episode, the Inter- 
American Commission for Human Rights recommended that 
Brazil adopt measures to protect inmates there.  But 
when the GoB failed to comply with the 
recommendations, the case was sent to the OAS\'s Inter- 
American Court for Human Rights (becoming the first 
Brazilian case to come before this court).  After this 
April\'s uprising, the Court summoned Brazil on April 
22 to a public hearing to discuss failures at Urso 
Branco (which holds three times its capacity of 350 
prisoners).  Minister of Justice Marcio Thomaz Bastos 
has publicly admitted that the Urso Branco riot was 
caused by overcrowding. 
 
116,000 INMATES OVER CAPACITY 
----------------------------- 
6.  Prison overcrowding is widespread in Brazil.  The 
federal government\'s National Penitentiary Department 
(NPD) statistics indicate that there are now 308,000 
inmates in jails and prisons nationwide.  When 
President Lula took office in January 2003, there were 
57,000 more inmates than capacity.  This number has 
doubled: there are now 116,000 more prisoners than 
capacity.  In the case of Santa Catarina state, the 
lack of prison space is leading to discontent among 
police, as officers complain that they risk their 
lives to arrest criminals and then watch them walk 
free.  In some cases, police have had to negotiate 
with the courts to decide who should be incarcerated 
and who released.  Overcrowding is also a grave 
problem at Sao Paulo\'s FEBEM juvenile detention 
centers, which register frequent escapes and other 
problems.  One of the most common requests made by 
detainees in all Brazilian prisons (as well as by 
violence specialists) is to separate common prisoners 
from the most dangerous inmates, a measure that could 
reduce violence and uprisings. 
 
7.  Along with overcrowding, lack of good sanitary 
conditions, diseases and abuse of prisoners are 
commonplace and are described by human rights 
organizations including Human Rights Watch and the 
Human Rights National Movement.  Prisoners are 
subjected to unhealthy conditions.  The Ministry of 
Health reports that tuberculosis and AIDS are common 
in the inmate population. 
 
8.  Brazil\'s 1988 Constitution mandates that the 
states are responsible for the penitentiary system. 
In reality, the states generally fund much of their 
public security budgets with federal money.  Thus, 
tight federal budgets have forced Security 
Secretariats in all twenty-seven states to request 
 
SIPDIS 
specific federal funds for public security, including 
for the penitentiary system.  Former senior official 
at the Ministry of Justice Elizabeth Sussekind said in 
press reports that the scarce resources available in 
the states are usually destined for police forces and 
to combat crime: \"The lack of resources together with 
the government\'s not paying attention is explosive,\" 
she noted.    She admits that Brazil is behind other 
countries on the issue of human rights in prisons. 
 
9.  To avoid more riots and to accommodate all 
prisoners, the National Penitentiary Department is 
planning to begin building three new penitentiaries in 
2004.  By the end of Lula\'s term in December 2006, 
five maximum-security prisons are planned, one of 
which is a new prison in Rondonia.  Edison Vidigal, 
the new Chief Justice of Brazil\'s Supreme Justice 
Tribunal, has recently proposed building a maximum 
security prison on an island off Brazil\'s coast.  With 
the bloody uprising in Rondonia\'s Urso Branco prison 
and drug traffickers in Rio\'s Rocinha favela capturing 
the headlines this year, the GoB announced in late 
April the release of R$180 million (about USD 60 
million) for security investments in all states.  This 
money is important to the states, since the federal 
government has only released R$1.8 million (about USD 
600,000) for public security investments nationwide 
this year. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
10.  It is not news that Brazilian prisons are in a 
state of crisis and have been for years.  The Lula 
administration, like previous governments has not come 
up with funding or an effective plan to address the 
problem.  The outlook is not promising, as President 
Lula has slashed funding for a whole range of social 
programs in such a constricted budget environment, it 
remains to be seen whether money and political will 
are available to address the deepening prison crisis.

Illicit Financial Activities, and to Marcos Pinta Gama, head 
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office for the Combat of 
Illicit International Activities, in meetings June 9 and 16, 
respectively.  Liao outlined to Emboff the steps that the GoB 
has taken to implement UNSCR 1483.  He explained that the 
Central Bank, acting pursuant to a presidential decree 
implementing UNSCR 1483, had issued a circular notice to all 
banks requiring them to verify whether they had any accounts 
in the names of the persons or entities listed by the UN. 
Similar action was taken by the Brazilian Securities and 
Exchange Commission with regard to investment firms.  To 
date, no matches with the Iraq lists had been reported. 
 
2. (SBU) Liao acknowledged that the GoB is dependent on 
banks\' efforts to comply with the UNSC-mandated sanctions. 
Emboff pointed out to both Pinta Gama and Liao that many new 
Iraqi entities had been added to the UN Sanctions Committee 
lists since the circular had been issued and suggested it 
might be useful to remind the financial institutions to 
maintain vigilance and update their databases with the latest 
UN lists.  Pinta Gama agreed to issue a circular notice to 
the banks informing them of the updated UN lists.

1. (C) On June 8, Emboff delivered reftel notice of the USG 
intention to freeze Assad Ahmad Barakat\'s assets to Marcus 
Rector, the acting head of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry\'s 
Office for the Combat of Illicit International Activities. 
Rector said the GoB would welcome hard evidence of a Barakat 
financial link to terrorism.  He added that, even absent such 
evidence, the GoB would like to be helpful in this case and 
would explore ways that any known Barakat assets in Brazil 
might be frozen based on the Paraguayan tax-evasion charges. 
After consulting with a Ministry of Justice colleague, Rector 
reported that a Brazilian judge could order such a freeze 
should Brazil receive an official (presumably Paraguayan) 
request. 
 
2. (C) In a follow-up meeting June 15 with both Rector and 
his newly-returned Office Director, Marcos Pinta Gama, the 
GoB reps repeated their request for any hard evidence the USG 
could share, both of Barakat\'s financial links to terrorism 
and of any assets he might have in Brazil.  Pinta Gama stated 
that it would be useful to establish, in the first instance, 
whether any such assets existed.  He suggested that FinCen 
could initiate this process by making a request through its 
direct information-sharing channel with COAF, the Brazilian 
financial intelligence unit.  When pressed, Pinta Gama agreed 
to ask that COAF direct a search for any such assets while 
deferring discussion of what to do with such assets until 
their existence had been established. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  Pinta Gama\'s agreement to look into any 
assets Barakat may have in Brazil is welcome, though such 
holdings are probably so well disguised that they\'ll be 
difficult to identify.  We will continue to follow up, 
including next week in a scheduled meeting with the Deputy 
Minister of Justice.  Any further specifics the Department 
can provide about suspected Barakat assets and/or tri-border 
links with terrorist financing would be appreciated.

SUBJECT: TALK OF BRAZIL-CHINA NUCLEAR COOPERATION OVERSTATED 
 
REF: A. BEIJING 9600 
     B. BEIJING 9152 
 
Classified By: SCI/C Daniel Rubinstein.  Reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  Much was made in the Brazilian press about 
an apparent agreement reached between Brasilia and Beijing 
during Lula\'s May visit to China to cooperate on nuclear 
energy and technology.  The story was exaggerated.  It is now 
clear that little more than inchoate informal agreements to 
study the issue were reached.  Real exchanges of materials or 
technologies will occur only years down the road, if ever. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Guilherme Patriota, Senior International Affairs 
Advisor at the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology 
(MCT), told Sci/C that President Lula\'s comments on nuclear 
cooperation with Beijing during his China trip in May were 
not well coordinated within the GoB, and that early press 
coverage of Lula\'s and Minister of Science and Technology 
Eduardo Campos\'s comments was misleading.  NOTE: MCT is the 
parent ministry of the GoB\'s umbrella nuclear agency CNEN. 
END NOTE.  As the GoB later made clear in public statements, 
no new agreement in the nuclear field was signed, nor were 
any draft MOUs, LOAs or other documents exchanged. 
 
3. (C) Beyond mention during the May visit of the long-extant 
China-Brazil umbrella agreement on nuclear cooperation, there 
was merely oral agreement to examine nuclear cooperation 
further during the visit to Brazil of Chinese COSTIND 
Minister Zhang Yunchuan this coming August.  Laercio Vinhas, 
Senior International Affairs Advisor of Brazil\'s nuclear 
agency CNEN, confirmed to Consulate Rio de Janeiro the very 
general nature of the discussions during Lula\'s May trip.  He 
added that, while China may be interested in sourcing raw 
uranium from Brazil, Brazil has yet to determine the 
magnitude of either its actual uranium reserves or its future 
domestic needs, given uncertainties in Brazil\'s own nuclear 
power program.  In addition, domestic legal changes would 
likely be required to engage in such sales. 
 
4. (C) MCT Advisor Patriota noted the contradiction between 
Lula\'s mention of possible joint Chinese-Brazilian uranium 
mining operations in Brazil and the sale of Brazilian uranium 
to China on the one hand, and the Brazilian Constitution and 
other laws on the other hand.  All nuclear-related activities 
in Brazil are the sole dominion of the Brazilian federal 
government.  Foreign governments, and private firms of any 
nationality - including Brazilian - are barred from 
activities such as uranium mining.  The law similarly 
prevents the sale of uranium to non-Brazilian state entities. 
 
5. (C) Patriota confirmed the concrete interest within some 
(pro-nuclear power) parts of the GoB and the state-owned 
nuclear industry to find new revenue streams for Brazil\'s 
money-starved nuclear power program, highlighting the 
specific goal of finding new business opportunities for state 
nuclear engineering and construction firm NUCLEP in 
participating in the construction of future Chinese nuclear 
power plants.  Patriota conceded, however, that NUCLEP would 
find steep price and quality competition from Chinese and 
foreign firms in China for what are essentially mammoth 
construction jobs.  There may exist secondary interest in 
finding buyers for raw Brazilian uranium assuming the laws 
are changed, but the value added of this type of trade is not 
very attractive for Brazil.  More broadly, President Lula has 
mandated a broad interagency review of Brazil\'s entire 
nuclear sector, including the economic viability of the 
current modest program.  Consequently, the likelihood of 
major new activities with foreign partners coming to fruition 
soon is highly doubtful.

1.   (SBU) Summary:  Latest official figures show the 
Brazilian economy grew a solid 1.6% in the first quarter of 
2004, the second consecutive quarter of growth at an annual 
rate of over 6%.  This still-preliminary growth data has 
been recently reinforced by, among other positive data 
points, news that industrial production in the first four 
months of 2004 climbed 6.1% above the first four months of 
2003.  Pundits have responded with alacrity to these hints 
of the real economy\'s recovery from Brazil\'s 2002/2003 
financial storm, with a cover story in newsweekly `Veja\' 
proclaiming Finance Minister Palocci now Lula\'s most popular 
minister and the man who \"wins them all.\"  Ideally, this 
favorable turn of fortunes should give the GoB much-needed 
political room to pursue its broader economic-reform agenda. 
The June 17 Senate defeat of Lula\'s minimum-wage bill, 
however, illustrates how coalition and perhaps government 
infighting are keeping the GoB on the policy defensive 
against the background of the looming October municipal 
elections.  The prospect of long-term sustained economic 
growth seems little closer.  End summary. 
 
2.   (U) GoB end-May figures show the Brazilian economy grew 
1.6% in the first quarter of 2004, as compared to the fourth 
quarter of 2003.  The numbers are consistent with a trend of 
strong growth (over 6% annualized) beginning in the fourth 
quarter of 2003.  Agriculture continued as the leading 
growth sector on the supply side, registering a 3.3% 
increase, while industry grew 1.7% and services rose by a 
much more measured 0.4%.  On the demand side, the continued 
export boom and the third consecutive quarterly increase in 
investment combined to lead growth.  Private consumption, 
while up 0.3%, increased far less than the 1.5% of the 
previous quarter.  Overall growth is the strongest since 
2000, but, unlike then, Brazil in 2004 is racking up record 
exports and a current-account surplus.

3.   (U) A host of other recent data points seem to 
underline the trend of economic recovery.  April retail 
sales were up 9.9% over April 2003.  Industrial production 
was up 6.1% in the first four months of 2004 compared to the 
same period of 2003.  Complete industrial production data 
for May is not yet available, but production of paper 
packaging materials, a barometer for broader industrial 
activity, was up 15.7% in May 2004 over May 2003.  Vehicle 
production rose 7.6% in the same period.  A Getulio Vargas 
Foundation (FGV) survey of manufacturing enterprises found 
capacity utilization in several sectors (textiles, 
detergents, paper, rubber, metals) at 90% or greater; an 
increasing number of business reported investment plans to 
increase capacity.  Consistent with that survey, the value 
of financing requests with BNDES, the national development 
bank, almost tripled in Jan-May 2004 compared to Jan-May 
2003. 
 
4.   (U) The dark linings behind this silver cloud are the 
weak growth of private consumption in the first quarter, 
plus the slow rate of growth of investment.  Exacerbating 
these factors, the Central Bank\'s monetary policy committee 
voted June 16 to keep interest rates unchanged at 16%, in 
the wake of recent inflation data and increasing 
inflationary expectations in the market.  There is growing 
belief that interest rates are unlikely to be cut further in 
the near future.  Also, some doubts have been raised about 
the accuracy of the quarterly growth statistics, as they are 
based on a new industrial production index that some 
commentators allege was not fully calibrated before being 
pressed into use. 
 
5.   (U) The latest growth data nevertheless has given the 
GOB some welcome relief from the almost constant criticism 
of the recent past.  In particular, Palocci\'s apparent trip 
from the public-opinion doghouse to the cover of leading 
national weekly news magazine Veja, under the headline 
\"Palocci Wins Them All,\" has been striking.  Suddenly, PT 
leader Genoino is declaring that Palocci will be used as a 
prime asset on the campaign trail to stump for PT party 
candidates in October\'s municipal elections.  Demands for a 
major overhaul of economic policy, which were becoming ever 
more widespread within Lula\'s own coalition base, have for 
now faded. 
 
6. (SBU) Ideally, these apparent buds of economic recovery 
should create a positive atmosphere for the Lula 
administration to work with the Congress on its broader 
structural and microeconomic reform agenda -- a necessity 
for sustained and strengthened growth.  But in real life, 
the GoB remains as much as ever on the policy defensive, 
hobbled by persistent lack of party discipline, both within 
and without the PT, and by the ramshackle nature of Lula\'s 
political coalition and the GoB\'s scandal-diminished 
political stature (ref B).  Most recently, on June 17 Lula\'s 
bill to increase the minimum wage to no more than Reals 260 
was voted down in the Senate, despite the administration\'s 
having pulled out all the stops to gain passage (septel). 
And elsewhere on the fiscal front: the Supreme Court may 
soon rule against the constitutionality of taxing 
pensioners, a crucial piece of last year\'s public-sector 
pension reform. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) With the exception of export growth, there is no 
clear sign yet that the recovery of the last two quarters is 
much more than a still modest, natural bounce-back after the 
extreme recessionary fallout from the 2002 financial crisis. 
Without its continued export and agricultural success, 
Brazil\'s overall economy would still be struggling by any 
standard.  Spreading and sustaining growth in the longer 
term depends on microeconomic and structural reform measures 
to increase efficiency and bring investment.  The realities 
of coalition politics in this municipal election year, 
however, look set to delay most of this agenda.  Many 
independent analysts look for growth to attenuate as the 
cyclical recovery plays out.

1. (C) Emboffs made ref A points on Hizballah financier 
Barakat to Brazilian Deputy Justice Minister Barreto in a 
June 21 meeting, following up on previous meetings with the 
Foreign Ministry (ref B).  Barreto said he would like to find 
a way to be helpful on the Barakat case.  Recalling that the 
GoB had investigated Barakat\'s finances after the Paraguayan 
extradition request, Barreto said they had found nothing 
suspicious in his occasional remittances to Lebanon, which 
were of amounts on the order of $500 to $1000.  Barreto 
agreed to ask COAF, Brazil\'s financial intelligence unit, to 
conduct a new investigation into Barakat\'s Brazilian assets, 
looking in particular for suspicious activity since Barakat\'s 
extradition to Paraguay. 
 
2. (C) Barreto suggested that the quickest and most practical 
avenue to freeze any Barakat assets in Brazil would be for 
Paraguay to make a formal request pursuant to the Mercosul 
legal assistance protocol, based on Barakat\'s tax evasion 
conviction in Paraguay.  This would allow a Brazilian judge 
to act quickly.  Barreto said the GoB had not to date 
received the sort of specific evidence of Barakat\'s terrorism 
finance activities that would enable it to bring charges 
against him or to enable a judge to freeze or seize his 
assets.  He pointed out that if the USG were to bring its own 
criminal charges against Barakat for terror finance, the GoB 
could then freeze his assets pursuant to a USG request under 
our MLAT.  Barreto agreed to look into whether Brazilian law 
would allow the GoB to take action based on the general 
exhortation in UNSC 1373 that UN members take action to stop 
the financing of terrorism -- but he reiterated that the GoB 
has no formal evidence indicating Barakat\'s terrorism links. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  Barreto was forthcoming and disposed to try 
to find a pragmatic way to help.  He repeated the request 
made by the Foreign Ministry (ref A) for specifics on the 
terrorist finance charge and on Barakat assets in Brazil to 
facilitate a GoB investigation.

SUBJECT:  MAKING ENDS MEET IN BRASILIA 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  Notwithstanding all its ministry buildings, 
rigid urban design and untypical (for Brazil) physical 
separation from slums and shantytowns, Brasilia is 
permeated with low-income earners working on the fringes of 
the formal economy or filling informal jobs.  They are 
endemic at the lively produce market, at the city park, and 
in the small shops of Brazil\'s more modest commercial 
streets.  It is from this class that current President Lula 
rose and to which, in large part, his election is ascribed. 
Econoff asked several long-standing personal contacts of 
this station to fill out surveys of monthly income and 
spending habits, for insight into the lives and day-to-day 
struggles of these workhorses.  This unscientific survey, 
if anything, attested to a deepened hardship in the lives 
of Brazil\'s marginal classes under Lula.  End summary. 
 
2.  Econoff presented eight acquaintances with the survey 
form, which asked for basic personal information and 
amounts spent in 17 broad categories including survival 
essentials, consumer goods, rent, transportation, and 
taxes.  Among those surveyed were self-appointed \"car 
guards\" who stake out their long-term territory on the 
shopping streets and parking lots to guide vehicles into 
parking spaces, wash cars, and watch cars so the vehicles 
will not get vandalized.  Two out of the three car guards 
who were approached with the survey were illiterate, thus 
unable to participate.  Another of the eight to not 
participate was newsstand-owner Fernando.  He said, \"I\'m 
sorry I will not fill this out, but no one knows what I 
make: not my wife, my children, the government, nor even 
God.\"  Apart from the car-washer who did fill in the form, 
the five respondents comprised two  micro-business owners, 
a soap saleswoman, and a clothing store clerk. 
 
3.  Ediclea is a single twenty-year-old mother of two who 
has been working as a \"car guard\" at the city park for 15 
years (sic).  She and her mother work at one of the parking 
lots seven days a week.  Ediclea often brings her infant 
and toddler, who can be expected to be recruited into the 
\"family business\" in a few years.  For the survey month, 
Ediclea personally made 100R from pocket change for 
watching customers\' cars.  Her father is retired from 
working at a bicycle shop and heads the household of eight 
family members. Four of them work, for a total of just over 
900 Reals (one USD = roughly 3.10 Reals) per month, 
yielding a combined family income of 1150R when added to 
the father\'s 240R minimum-wage pension.  Food, water, and 
utilities consume 35% of the family total income.  The 
family tax bite is 17%, which is most likely INSS (social 
security taxes).  Clothing and household goods accounted 
for 39%, and the balance of 9% was spent on medicine for 
the survey month. 
 
4.  Antonia is a 52-year-old married woman with two 
students in the household.  She and her husband have had an 
exotic juice business at a produce market for 11 years. 
She charges 1R for a cup of juice, 3.50R for a small 
bottle, and 8R for a large container.  The couple grossed 
1500R in the survey month.  The business\' net profit has 
declined steadily for the last five years, says Antonia, 
due to increases in Amazon fruit prices, container costs, 
and transportation costs, which they have been unable to 
pass on to consumers.  Taxes consume 20% of their income. 
Even though they are in the food business, their food costs 
are the greatest expense incurred by the family in the 
survey month, at 40% of their income.  Transportation 
accounted for another 20% of expenditures, followed by 
telephone bills (9%), electricity and medicine (both 6%), 
and water (5%).  Antonia was forced to tap into savings for 
120R to meet expenses for the month. 
 
5.  Antonio washes cars for 5R a pop and earns 10R for a 
wash and wax at the same market where Antonia sells juice. 
At thirty-eight, he is the sole supporter of his family of 
five, and made 500R last month.  He is not liable for 
paying any income tax, does not pay social security tax, 
and has no housing expenses, since he lives in a small 
shack which he built himself with scrap materials he 
accumulated.  The lion\'s share (44%) of his income in the 
survey month went to clothing (100R) and transportation 
(120R).  All other expenditures were 40R or under: food, 
alcohol, cigarettes, a loan repayment of 25R, water, 
electricity, household goods, water, telephone, medicine, 
and presents.  He is one of ten children who assists in 
supporting his mother by giving her 30R per month. 
 
6.  Fifty-three-year-old Angelica sells soap at local fairs 
and reports that she made 200R during the survey month. 
She and her taxi-driver husband have an empty nest.  Some 
of Angelica\'s living expenses are paid by her sister who 
works for the state government, her manicurist daughter who 
lives in another town, and her husband.  Last month, 
Angelica paid 50R in taxes, 30R for her basic monthly 
telephone charge, and 80R for food.  A chain smoker, she 
also inhaled 40R worth of cigarettes. 
7.  Rosangela, 20, has worked at a clothing store for the 
past five months with a salary (no commission) of 350R per 
month, and studies at a private college.  She lives with 
her family of eight and contributes 150R per month for 
general household living expenses, 50R for household goods, 
and 10R for the monthly phone bill.  She always walks to 
work, but occasionally takes the city bus to other locales 
(1.60R flat fare), and spent roughly 10R for that purpose. 
She has an educational loan with 70R monthly payments, and 
spends 20R per month on fast food.  In an act of discipline 
for someone of this age working in a clothing store, she 
only purchased 35R of clothes.  The balance of her income 
was used to purchase a small gift. 
 
8.  According to a 2002 study conducted by SEBRAE, the 
Brazilian support organization for small business, in 
Brazil\'s eight major metropolitan areas, including 
Brasilia, there are 1.4 million informal workers with an 
average income of 903 Reals per month.  Three of the four 
people that Econoff surveyed earning a living on Brasilia\'s 
informal economy earned less than that average.  Formal- 
economy workers earn substantially more: according to the 
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) 
their average income is 1,789 R per month.  Residents of 
Brasilia -- a privileged government town which unlike Rio, 
Sao Paulo, and virtually all other Brazilian urban centers 
does not contain sprawling low-income zones or slums; the 
latters\' equivalent are instead located in separate 
\'satellite cities\' up to an hour away -- enjoy an average 
income of 3,241 R, according to the same IBGE tables. 
 
9.  COMMENT.  This (admittedly unscientific) survey 
contained zero that would attest to any improvement in the 
lives of Brazil\'s marginal classes under Lula\'s government 
or for that matter in the later years of Cardoso\'s since 
1998.  None of these five people reported any income 
increase in the last five years, and the only person with a 
business reported declining profits over the last years. 
No one reported that they saved any portion of their 
remuneration, nor make rental or house payments.  Indeed, 
the main device for these persons of humble station to get 
by seems to be their ability to economize on habitation 
costs.  With the exception of Rosangela, those surveyed 
either live in the satellite cities in hand-built shacks, 
or live with others who have erected these make-shift 
structures.  The extended family is alive and well in 
Brasilia, partially propagated by economic necessity, as 
family members pool their money for day-to-day survival.

SUBJECT: LULA FINALLY GETS A BREAK - CONGRESS SUPPORTS HIS 
MINIMUM WAGE HIKE 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Brazilian President Lula da Silva broke 
his losing streak on June 23 when the Chamber of Deputies 
voted to ratify his Presidential Decree raising the minimum 
wage from R$240 to R$260 (about US$ 87) per month.  This vote 
follows a series of defeats Lula has suffered in Congress, 
caused by a fractured coalition and coming on top of polls 
showing his popularity has slipped.  While this vote does not 
fully restore Lula\'s political authority, it should help end 
the worst phase of his presidency --a losing streak that 
began on February 13 when the \"Waldomiro scandal\" broke, 
revealing that one of Lula\'s advisors had solicited bribes 
from a numbers racketeer.  With municipal elections coming up 
in October, Lula is surely breathing a sigh of relief that he 
may be able to refortify his coalition and begin queuing up 
his legislative agenda for late 2004 and 2005. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) On June 23, the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies voted 
272-172 to ratify a Presidential Decree issued by President 
Lula on April 30 that raised the minimum wage from R$240 to 
R$260 per month.  This raise was criticized both inside and 
outside Lula\'s coalition for being so small it barely covers 
inflation.  Presidential decrees must be approved by 
Congress, and this one had a torturous path to ratification 
that carried the administration on a six-week roller coaster 
ride.  Far more than the numerical level of the minimum wage 
was at stake:  the strength of Lula\'s eight-party coalition 
was being tested, and the opposition sensed his weakness and 
began pressing to defeat his legislative agenda.  A loss on 
the minimum wage would have called into question the 
President\'s ability to pass any future bills.  Lula himself 
lobbied hard for passage and deployed his cabinet ministers 
and political advisors to work the corridors of Congress on 
his behalf. 
 
3. (SBU) On June 2, Lula\'s coalition in the Chamber beat back 
an opposition proposal to raise the wage as high as R$275 per 
month (a raise that Lula calls fiscally impossible).  But 
when the measure went to the Senate on June 17, several 
administration allies either abstained or voted for the 
opposition\'s R$275 proposal, suggesting Lula had lost 
legislative authority in the upper house.  The measure then 
went back to the Chamber for the final decision, and the June 
23 vote ratifying the Lula-decreed R$260 wage allows the 
administration to breathe a sigh of relief. 
 
4. (SBU) The matter is now closed.  Candidates for Lula\'s 
Workers\' Party (PT) running for local office in the October 
elections are certain to be criticized for not endorsing a 
higher wage, but this had become a must-win battle for the 
administration.  As it stands, Lula\'s authority in Congress 
is bent but not broken.  His coalition in the Chamber is more 
dependable than in the Senate, and Chamber Speaker Joao Paulo 
Cunha (PT-Sao Paulo) is certain to reap Lula\'s gratitude 
(pundits say he may get a cabinet slot in the next 
Ministerial shuffle).  Lula will live to fight another day in 
Congress.

IN ARTICLE I: 
 
A.  SUBSTITUTING \"AO TRAFEGO DE LONGO CURSO DE CARGAS\" FOR \"A 
CARGA MARITIMA\".  THE BRAZILIANS JUSTIFY THIS CHANGE BASED ON 
THE FACT THAT IN BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE, CARGA MARITIME 
INCLUDES CABATOGE, WHICH NEITHER THE USG NOR THE GOB WANT TO 
INCLUDE IN THE AGREEMENT.  THE FIRST QUOTED PHRASE MORE 
CLOSELY RELATES TO THE ENGLISH \"OCEANBORNE CARGO\". 
 
B.  GOB SUGGESTS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES WHICH SERVE TO CONFORM 
THE TRANSLATED BRAZILIAN VERSION TO THE RULES OF PORTUGUESE: 
 \"Cargas transportadas\" should be plural, and changed from 
\"carga transportada\".  GoB would like clarifying language in 
at least the Portuguese version from \"portos e pontos\" 
(ports and points) to \"portos ou pontos\" (ports or points). 
Almeida contends this gives the phrase added earlier by the 
U.S. side more flexibility, since transported cargo doesn\'t 
strictly go between ports and points, but might go from port 
to port, port to point, or point to point.  Manso de Almeida 
also requested the change be made from \"no territorio\" to 
\"do territorio\". 
 
c.  If the USG accepts this language, the Portuguese version 
would read as follows: 
 
\"As Partes desenvolverao as suas relacoes bilaterais de

1.  SUMMARY.  Acaua is a modest municipality of 5,430 people 
in northeastern Brazil that was selected as one of two pilot 
communities for President Lula\'s flagship social program 
\"Fome Zero\" (Zero Hunger) in February of 2003.  Econoff\'s 
June 2, 2004 trip to Acaua provided a sharp contrast to 
desolate, destitute pilot sister town of Guaribas (Ref. A). 
Acaua\'s infrastructure and accessibility is far better than 
that of Guaribas and many surrounding municipalities.  A 
trip to Acaua begs the question of how this municipality was 
selected as a Zero Hunger pilot town and invites the answer 
that the choice was political rather than needs-based.  By 
its inhabitants\' own accounts, Zero Hunger has brought only 
minor and spotty benefits to the community, and the recent 
watershed improvements in local life have come rather with 
electrification and the ongoing construction of cisterns - 
both initiatives of the previous, Cardoso administration. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Both  Acuaua and Guaribas are in Piaui, one of Brazil\'s 
poorest states, have mayors from Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT), 
and are the Zero Hunger pilot towns.  There, the 
similarities end.  In contrast to Guaribas, Acaua has 
several municipal buildings, some cobblestone roads, general 
stores, budding businesses, and satellite dishes on several 
homes.  Note.  The scattered satellite dishes mounted on 
numerous Acaua dwellings cost 400 Reals - quite a luxury 
when considering the minimum wage of 260 Reals per month. 
End note.  According to many people, the defining moment of 
increased prosperity was not the arrival of Lula\'s Zero 
Hunger food cards and accompanying social programs, but 
electrification three years ago. 
 
3.  Eraldo, 29, has had a tire repair business for five 
years.  He worked during daylight hours in the dim premises 
before he received electricity.  He only had a pump and 
rudimentary accoutrements to fix the tires.  Today he has 
lights, a compressor, and an electric cutter which has 
replaced his hand-saw.  His home is at the side of the shop, 
and he has converted the front part into a snack shop.  He 
displays chips and has a case with hot foods.  Eraldo\'s 
little store caters to students who sometimes come for lunch 
from the vibrant blue three-room school cattycornered from 
his shop.  The fact that students have discretionary- 
spending money for less-nutritious snacks was a surprise 
when put in the context that this was a Zero Hunger pilot 
town. 
 
4.  Renato, 36, has had the largest grocery store in the 
community for seven years.  Renato estimated that about half 
the people in the municipality benefit from Zero Hunger.  He 
commented that his gross income has not increased since the 
implementation of the program: just the form of payment from 
many customers has changed.  The blaring television could be 
seen from the counter, fed by a satellite dish.  The shelves 
in the two large rooms were stocked not only with staples, 
but with what most would consider discretionary items like 
nail polish, fancy flip-flops, liquor, and sling shots.  The 
freezer section contained meat and ice cream. 
 
5.  Equmira, 29, is one of five teachers in the secondary 
school.  She was born in Acaua, went to the college in 
Piaui\'s capitol, Teresina, and came back to the family farm 
to live with her parents and four brothers.  She teaches 30 
9-17 year-old youngsters four hours per day, eight months a 
year.  Equmira did not believe her students faced 
malnutrition before Fome Zero commenced, since there were 
many farming families with children in the school, and added 
that the biggest difference was the five cisterns built in 
the community over the last few years, which she associated 
with the program.  Note.  Interesting that Equmira 
associates these cisterns with Zero Hunger, as the 
installations were initiated during the Cardoso 
administration with UNICEF and World Bank funding. 
 
6.  Twenty-seven-year-old Val was born in Petrolina, a city 
two hours away in the state of Pernambuco, where he was a 
gas station attendant.  He moved his bride and their two 
children to Acaua after the advent of electricity to fulfill 
his dream to own a business.  His father-in-law gave him 
land, and he and two friends constructed the medium-sized 
bar in less than 30 days.  The structure contains a TV, pool 
table, refrigerator/freezer, and two shelves of beauty 
products and snack foods.  Val said his place functions as a 
bar on weekends, and pointed to a shelf with liquor, soft 
drinks, and cigarettes.  He praised the arrival of the 
electricity that allowed him to manifest his dream, but did 
not have an opinion on the Zero Hunger program. 
 
7.  Econoff stopped at several houses for a more 
comprehensive spectrum of opinions.  Barthalemeu, 18, is one 
of five children and works on the family farm raising goats, 
pigs, horses, and chickens.  The family sells goat cheese 
and left-over meat to the local market.  Barthalemeu pointed 
out the cistern which was funded by UNICEF in 2002 during 
the Cardoso administration.  Regina, 29, is the mother of 
three children, and the wife of a farmer.  She raved about 
Zero Hunger and commented that her family also received the 
Bolsa Familia (\"Family Stipend\", an umbrella family-benefit 
program) stipend for a total of 95 Reals (exchange roughly 3 
Reals to the USD) per month. 
 
8.  Antonio lives in a cluster of eight houses built with 
materials funded by the Cardoso administration.  The 
municipality released the land, and eight families helped 
each other erect these humble dwellings in 30 days.  Antonio 
commented that he did not vote for Lula during the 2002 
election cycle, and will not vote for him in the future.  He 
added that he voted against the current PT mayor, and 
resented the fact that Mayor Antonio Rodrigues Filho does 
not even live in Acaua, but in Paulastino, a municipality 18 
kilometers away.  Rita, 27, was downright bitter about the 
Zero Hunger program.  She has one school-aged child, no 
husband, no income, and does not receive any money from Zero 
Hunger or the Family Fund. 
 
9.  Jose was repairing the cobblestone streets.  He had done 
this seasonal work for 25 years in Acaua, which was 
incorporated eight years ago.  This 36 year-old man appeared 
to be well into his 50s, evidence of his difficult life of 
working in the sun to support his family of four.  He cannot 
work during the rainy season, but commented that as a 
recipient of the Zero Hunger card, he is less reliant on his 
extended family for basic needs. 
 
10.  The mayor\'s office in Acaua looks strikingly nice for a 
small Brazilian municipality.  The city is run by City 
Administrator Jose Antonio Filho, 45, who left a teller job 
at the State Bank of Piaui after he was appointed by his 
father, the mayor.  He said that the federal and state 
government governments, in concert with several NGOs, were 
working together to implement a myriad of social and 
community improvement programs.  In addition to the ongoing 
installation of 394 cisterns, a community center with a 
swimming pool and 20 houses are being built. 
 
11.  Econoff asked about Rita\'s desperate situation as a 
single mother with no income and not qualifying for Zero 
Hunger and associated benefits.  Filho said the community 
committee of seven people met once a month to evaluate who 
should receive benefits, which was difficult, because it is 
\"the poor choosing the poor\".  Although there is no appeal 
process, he added that a family could re-apply monthly for 
the benefit. 
 
12.  Children guided Econoff to the home of Izilina, the 
municipality\'s Secretary of Health, by saying it was the 
nicest in Acaua.  Indeed, it was a spacious, well- 
constructed home with coffered ceilings and crown moldings. 
This 33 year-old woman has been in her position since 1997, 
and her husband heads tourism (sic!) in the mayor\'s office. 
The community has a public health team consisting of 19 
employees, including a dentist, doctor, and nurse.  All of 
the health programs in place existed before Zero Hunger. 
 
13.  Edvaldo Pereira, attorney from the mayor\'s office in 
Petrolina, Pernambuco, commented that he could show Econoff 
people much worse off than the citizens of Acaua in a nearby 
quilombo (communities founded originally by run-away 
slaves).  Afranho is a community located in Pernambuco, less 
than eight miles from Acaua.  The mayor of the town is from 
the opposition party PSDB and commented that only 15 of 
Afranho\'s 400 inhabitants receive Zero Hunger cards. The 
municipality of 400 is much closer in appearance to Guaribus 
than to Acaua with its dirt roads and nothing but individual 
dwellings - not even a grocery store.  Francisca de Lima, 
57, is a 30-year resident who lives in a shanty with six 
family members.  They are subsistence farmers and receive no 
benefits from any government program.  Lima said she has not 
seen any improvement since the Lula government came to 
power. 
 
14.  There is a sharp contrast between the Zero Hunger pilot 
towns.  There is definitely poverty to be found in Acaua, 
but not so ubiquitous and repressive as in Guaribas. 
Piaui\'s Fome Zero Director Rosangela Sousa commented on 
Econoff\'s earlier trip (Ref. B) that Guaribus was selected 
as the pilot due to lack of infrastructure, and that Acaua 
was selected because it had the lowest per capita income. 
Guaribas was an obvious choice, but that of Acaua was more 
complex.  The raw per capita income numbers were deceptive, 
because many people in the community are subsistence 
farmers, thus did not have a dire hunger problem. 
 
15.  Comment.  It is striking that few residents gave Lula 
the credit for the positive changes Acaua has experienced 
via the Zero Hunger program.  During this period of the 
administration\'s eroding  popularity, not even this showcase 
municipality is generating positive publicity  for the 
administration\'s social programs.

accordingly. 
 
1. (U) Taking advantage of a previously scheduled courtesy 
call, Econoff delivered reftel demarche June 29 to the new head 
of the Ministry of External Relations\' (MRE) Intellectual 
Property Division, Otavio Brandelli.  Brandelli had no 
immediate reaction to news of the 90-day extension or formation 
of a working group via the Bilateral Consultative Mechanism, 
but told Econoff that a cable to be sent to the Embassy in 
Washington was currently awaiting Minister Amorim\'s approval. 
He asked what specific language would be published on June 30 
in regard to the GSP review, warning of potentially negative 
reactions.  In a follow-up phone conversation after the 
Minister\'s approval of the cable, Brandelli explained that the 
GoB accepted the proposal for bilateral meetings on the issue, 
but not necessarily through the existing Bilateral Consultative 
Mechanism.  Noting the importance of flexibility, he implied 
that less formal, or less cumbersome channels of communication 
exist. 
 
2. (SBU) Offering his personal reaction, Brandelli expressed 
dismay that private sector dissatisfaction with Brazil\'s IPR 
enforcement could result in retaliatory trade sanctions. 
Econoff replied that the objective of the demarche was exactly 
to avoid such a situation via a mutually agreed upon plan to be 
determined within the 90-day extension of the investigation. 
Brandelli cautioned that there could be very negative responses 
from the Brazilian Congress, especially as Congress\'s 
Investigatory Commission (the CPI) had just released its final 
report.  A negative GSP announcement, he said, could be 
perceived as a slap in the face by those who worked 
cooperatively with the USG and associations of U.S. right 
holders to document the significant problem of piracy and 
enforcement in Brazil.  Brandelli encouraged efforts to de- 
politicize the subject. 
 
3.  (SBU) He agreed that the Piracy CPI report is a positive 
development, especially given its clarification of the damages 
sustained by Brazilian music, software, fashion and other 
industries.  Mentioning Brazil\'s concerns with geographical 
indicators such as cachaca (Brazilian sugar-cane based spirit 
supposed being made and marketed in Europe) and capuacu 
(Amazonian fruit trademarked in Japan and the U.S.), Brandelli 
noted that both Brazil and the U.S. want more effective 
enforcement, but need to proceed toward that end in a sensible 
manner, taking into account the question of resources. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Econoff asked about the future of the 
Interministerial Committee for Fighting Piracy (CICP), given 
the CPI\'s recommendation that the committee be replaced. 
Brandelli noted that the committee continues to function, and 
told econoff that Ambassador Clodoaldo Hugueney, MRE Secretary 
General for Integration, Economics and Foreign Trade, had met 
with the Vice Minister of Justice in May 2004 to initiate 
discussion on possible changes to the CICP, exploring options 
like moving it from the Justice Minister to the National 
Security Agency.  Brandelli\'s personal recommendation is that 
the Finance Ministry oversee the CICP. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Explaining his involvement in the development of the 
Brazilian IPR legislation of 1996, Brandelli expressed 
disappointment that bilateral problems remain, even after 
Brazil made the exceptional effort to produce first class 
legislation.  Whatever plans are made via a bilateral process, 
he said, the GoB would not pass new laws or sign on to new 
treaties, insisting that current legislation goes far beyond 
TRIPS requirements and is more than sufficient. He asserted 
that the July 2003 law (10.695/2003) toughening certain 
copyright penalties and improving procedures on destruction of 
seized goods is quite far-reaching, although he allowed that 
more time is needed to fairly judge its application and 
results.  He lamented that there seemed to be little 
appreciation of the significance of this legislation, implying 
that Brazil does not get its due credit when it comes to the 
fight against piracy.  (Note:  The CPI has recommended draft 
legislation that goes beyond the 2003 law on minimum penalties 
as well as procedures for making indictments and 
storage/analysis of seized goods.)

1.  SUMMARY: The Chamber of Deputies\' Parliamentary 
Investigative Commission (CPI) on Piracy and Tax Evasion 
released a draft version of its final report on June 8, making 
recommendations of unprecedented scope for Brazil, including 
draft legislation, revisions to the penal procedures code and 
the adoption of a coordinated national plan to address the 
problem of piracy in Brazil.  The report contains chapters on 
specific industries (paras 10 - 19) as well as on criminal acts 
that have come to the CPI\'s attention during the last year 
(para 20 and septel).  The CPI presented a final version of the 
report to Justice Minister Bastos on June 23 along with a 
request for his support of the recommendations, particularly 
the national plan.  The CPI is now officially deactivated, but 
executive members plan to request the formation of a formal 
congressional working group with legal standing to follow 
through with the cases initiated by the CPI.  Plans are also 
underway for a formal ceremony in mid-August to launch a book 
version of the report and present it to the President of the 
Chamber and to President Lula.  While the fanfare surrounding 
the CPI and the recommendations from its report have greatly 
raised the profile of the fight against piracy, it is uncertain 
that there is the government will and, perhaps more 
importantly, the resources to put the good ideas into action. 
End summary. 
 
Broad Recommendations 
--------------------- 
 
2.  The CPI\'s over-arching recommendation is the formulation of 
a \"National Plan to Combat Piracy\" and creation of a 
corresponding government body responsible for intelligence 
gathering, policy formation and public outreach efforts.  This 
agency would be responsible for coordination with federal and 
state police, various state and federal ministries, as well as 
representatives of affected businesses and civil society. 
Among the plan\'s primary objectives are: 
 
--  execution of educational campaigns and institutional 
support of privately sponsored campaigns to inform the average 
citizen of intellectual property rights, the economic damage 
piracy causes, and piracy\'s link with organized crime; 
--  creation and maintenance of a national database allowing 
for the cross-referencing of intelligence in the 
investigation of organized crime; 
--  support the creation in every state of a specific 
division within the Secretariat for Public Security that 
coordinates operations and centralizes information through 
the creation of specialized police units that interlink with 
municipal authorities; 
--  incentives for special operations with the Attorney 
General\'s office and the Federal Police to break up piracy 
mafias; 
--  combating the entry of illegal products and legal 
products destined for criminal purposes; 
--  coordination of inspection/surveillance at ports, 
airports and land borders to include training of the key 
personnel; 
--  training and capacity-building for police and inspection 
agencies on the federal, state and municipal level. 
 
3.  The CPI notes that the goals of its plan correspond in 
large part to the 2001 Presidential Decree that created the 
Inter-Ministerial Committee to Combat Piracy (CICP).  Citing 
the lack of desired results and the growing rate of piracy 
since then, the CPI concludes that its national plan and 
corresponding agency should replace the CICP.  The draft report 
also suggests that the Executive branch undertake the revision 
of a treaty with Paraguay regarding the use of bonded 
warehouses at the ports of Santos (Sao Paulo) and Paranagua 
(Parana), as well as provide more personnel and more 
technologically-advanced equipment to customs and police 
inspectors at ports of entry. 
 
4.  Formal proposals directed at various levels of the 
government put forward the CPI\'s recommendations and conclude 
the draft report.  The national plan and the treaty revision 
are directed to the Executive branch; improved inspection for 
counterfeit auto parts during auto-licensing procedures is 
directed to state governors; the request to expedite cases and 
sentencing of those involved in organized crime is directed to 
the judicial branch, etc.  Three specific requests involve Law 
Kin Chong, the notorious alleged smuggler arrested earlier this 
month attempting to bribe the CPI President (ref A):  one to 
the Minister of Justice requesting the reactivation of a 7-year- 
old Sao Paulo federal police investigation of his business 
activities; one to the Sao Paulo state prosecutor making the 
same request; and one to the Minister of Justice requesting the 
formation of a special task-force (comprised of Federal Police, 
Attorney General, the Revenue Service, and the Sao Paulo 
Secretary for Public Security) to investigate Chong\'s criminal 
 
SIPDIS 
activities. 
 
5.  Two draft bills suggested by the CPI would alter the penal 
procedures legislation in reference to crimes against 
intellectual property.  The CPI\'s objective is to treat these 
crimes with greater severity as a means of deterrence, as well 
as to ease the work of law enforcement authorities in 
apprehending and prosecuting perpetrators. Its recommendations 
go beyond the legislation the GoB passed in July 2003 with 
regard to certain copyright offenses (Ref C).  The new language 
adds computer programs to the list of intellectual works, and 
increases minimum penalties from less than one year to two 
years and two months, plus fines to avoid suspended sentences. 
One of the proposed changes modifies law 9.609/98 on IPR 
protections for software to include the 2 year and two months 
minimum sentence and adds publishing, publicizing and 
disseminating information on the sale, purchase, rental, import 
or export of pirated software by conventional or electronic 
methods as a crime. 
 
CPI\'s Testament 
--------------- 
 
6.  In a public session June 8, preceding release and 
subsequent approval of the draft report by the entire CPI, 
rapporteur Deputy Josias Quintal (PMDB-RJ) characterized the 
CPI\'s work over the last year as a first step on an arduous 
road of concrete action to rid Brazil of piracy.  He called 
piracy a serious obstacle to national development, noting that 
in today\'s world of technological advances and the Internet, 
intellectual capital is even more valuable than financial 
capital.  He strongly criticized the authorities that 
implicitly support piracy by allowing it to propagate in their 
midst.  While piracy is an international scourge, Quintal noted 
that it has become a part of the Brazilian culture, as laws do 
not impede it and the population remains largely oblivious to 
the harm it causes.  He emphasized that, while the media has 
played up the CPI\'s involvement in high-profile arrests or 
criminal allegations, the CPI\'s main responsibility is to 
document the Brazilian symptoms of the disease of piracy and 
tax evasion and suggest remedies, not to single-handedly cure 
the country by arresting all those responsible. 
 
7.  Quintal said that government negligence and omission are in 
large part responsible for the rampant nature of piracy in 
Brazil, citing the \"Paraguay fair,\" an open market known as the 
central point of sale for pirated goods in Brasilia, as 
evidence of the government\'s complicity.  Passive and active 
corruption combined with insufficient inspections at ports of 
entry, lax application of laws and non-deterrent level 
sentences indicate a government mechanism in need of repair, he 
said.  He denied that the CPI sought to target the informal 
sector writ large -- the poor seller and buyer attempting to 
make ends meet -- but said the focus had been the organized 
crime elements that finance and profit from the trade. 
However, he highlighted the need for public awareness campaigns 
to demonstrate the danger and damage caused by piracy and 
thereby effect change in the average citizen\'s attitude and 
purchasing action. 
The Written Word 
---------------- 
 
8.  The report\'s introduction notes that the CPI undertook its 
work with the goal of providing a base to be further deepened 
via dissemination to society at large and to the three layers 
of government (federal, state and municipal) that would ideally 
result in a structural reengineering of the agencies 
responsible for combating the various crimes of piracy. 
Characterizing the report as simply the beginning of a 
Herculean task that will require the support of many across 
Brazilian society and beyond, the deputies make clear that they 
seek a paradigm that prevents and represses piracy in all its 
forms throughout the country.  To help achieve these ends, the 
CPI offers its report and recommendations, and urges that 
further study of the problem be undertaken in order to 
establish a legal framework capable of handling the evolving 
dimension and complexity of the issue. 
 
9.  The initial chapters of the report detail the organization, 
membership (para 23) and activities of the CPI, including a 
list of the individuals from whom the CPI requested testimony. 
Visits to Paraguay and Washington D.C. are described.  (Note: 
Post has not yet obtained the final version of the CPI\'s 
report, only the initial, hastily assembled 244-page draft.) 
The CPI also offers its working definition of piracy in the 
Brazilian context, which includes falsification, duplication, 
and tax evasion in the forms of contraband and embezzlement. 
Noting the sense of victory that swindling the authorities and 
legitimate businesses by buying pirated goods provokes in some 
consumers, the CPI offers anecdotal as well as statistical 
evidence of the broad public acceptance of piracy.  The 
deputies argue that it is not social problems that cause piracy 
but vice versa.  Piracy feeds unemployment, crimes against 
public health and the consumer, murder, extortion, and 
corruption, according to the report, hardly a victimless crime. 
 
Drinks, Cigarettes and Drugs 
---------------------------- 
 
10.  The body of the report details the major sectors 
investigated, including beverages (principally alcoholic), 
cigarettes, photocopiers, books, recording industry (CDs), 
DVDs, software, pharmaceutical products, eyewear, pay TV, 
automotive parts, and laptop computers/notebooks.  Many of the 
industries suffer unethical or illegal competition in the form 
of under-invoicing, use of sub-standard quality inputs, tax 
evasion through use of fraudulent stamps and forms and 
trademark infringement.  Dangers to public health are mentioned 
throughout the report, especially in reference to beverages, 
cigarettes, auto parts and pharmaceutical products.  Many of 
the recommendations specific to individual sectors address the 
need to improve inspections by health and customs authorities, 
revise taxation methods, toughen criminal penalties and launch 
educational campaigns so that piracy is perceived by the public 
as serious crime. 
 
11.  The main concerns of the beverage sector are unethical 
competition by way of trademark violations and adulteration of 
the products as well as a high tax rate (35 percent for beer) 
that encourages evasion and fraud.  Recommendations include 
more effective inspection of businesses and decreasing the tax 
rate, as well as draft legislation that would implement an 
outflow measurement system to aid authorities in conducting 
inspections. 
 
12.  The CPI dedicated much time and effort to investigating 
the piracy and tax evasion involved in the cigarette industry. 
One of the CPI\'s most publicized busts occurred in September 
2003 when notorious cigarette smuggler Roberto Eleuterio da 
Silva (aka Lobao) was arrested.  Cigarettes face an extremely 
high tax burden (65% of the cost to the consumer) in Brazil, 
but benefit from a favorable production environment in 
neighboring Paraguay. These factors, combined with porous 
borders, lax inspection and corruption, attract the criminal 
elements that have constructed a complex international network 
of individuals and \"companies\" involved in the smuggling of 
cigarettes.  The CPI report details several of the smuggling 
networks, naming names and citing wiretapped phone 
conversations that implicate government officials and others 
(septel).  The report recommends harsher penalties for 
smuggling contraband, more resources for Federal Police, health 
and tax inspection authorities, and swift completion of cases 
against Lobao and his cohorts.  The CPI also suggests that the 
Ministry of Health create special, more rigorous, authorization 
procedures for operation of cigarette factories. 
 
13.  The CPI investigated three cases of falsified or 
adulterated pharmaceutical products suspected of causing deaths 
and serious injury over the last year.  While these cases were 
not linked to tax evasion or organized crime, the CPI cites 
weaknesses in the inspection systems of ANVISA (Sanitary 
Surveillance Agency) as well as the negligence of individual 
producers for the errors that resulted in public health crises. 
The CPI also raises health concerns with regard to the eyewear 
sector, which suffers Chinese competition fueled by trademark 
infringement, tax evasion and sub-standard inputs, as well as a 
plethora of unlicensed business and distributors that purport 
to offer prescription lenses.  The report urges the Ministry of 
Health to improve ANVISA\'s inspections capabilities, to conduct 
systematic product raids at retail outlets and do laboratory 
analyses of the products, and to use the ANVISA registration 
system and data bank to provide correct and rapid information 
to the public regarding risks of dangerous products. 
 
Copyright 
--------- 
 
14.  Illegal photocopying of books, especially university 
students copying textbooks, comes in for heavy criticism in the 
report.  Book copyright infringement is committed on an 
industrial scale, providing an underground economy within many 
Brazilian universities, according to the report.  The CPI 
suggests increasing the penalty for this crime so that the 
majority of cases that are prosecuted do not result in 
suspended sentences (which is the case from crimes with a 
minimum penalty of one year or less) and urges the Ministry of 
Education to educate students as to the criminal nature of the 
activity, making the study of author\'s rights mandatory for all 
law graduates. 
 
15.  The CPI\'s investigation of CD and DVD piracy draws heavily 
on industry reports and statistics, focusing on the entry of 
virgin CD (CDRs) through ports and organized crime aspects, 
including a detailed look into some of Law Kin Chong\'s 
operations in the state of Amazonas.  One chapter describes a 
particular sting operation carried out by the Federal Police 
and Military Police of Amazonas against video rental 
establishments and based on an investigation by ADEPI (the 
Association for the Defense of Intellectual Property, linked 
with MPAA.)  Amazonas is said to be the center of audiovisual 
piracy in Brazil.  Chinese and Lebanese mafias operating 
through Paraguay are described as the major smugglers of 
Taiwanese origin CDRs - the report even notes that Philips has 
the patent on CD production in Brazil until 2009.  The CPI also 
highlights the damage piracy has on the Brazilian music 
industry, noting a reduction of 50% of the legitimate music 
market in the last five years, and describes some of the 
industry\'s efforts to fight CD piracy in Brazil. 
Recommendations in this sphere include revisions of the treaty 
with Paraguay concerning use of bonded warehouses, increased 
financial and human resources support for the Federal Police 
and the tax authorities, as well as the installation of non- 
intrusive inspection equipment (such as container x-ray 
machines) at ports. 
 
16.  The importance of Brazil\'s software industry as an engine 
of production for the economy as a whole sets the stage for the 
CPI\'s examination of software piracy.  The GoB\'s selection of 
software as one of the priority sectors for its industrial 
policy efforts, cited in the report, further emphasizes the 
stakes.  As with music and audiovisual piracy, the CPI draws 
heavily from industry reports and statistics provided by ABES 
(Brazilian Association of Software Companies) and BSA (Business 
Software Alliance) to demonstrate the damages caused by the 
proliferation of CD burners and the power of the internet used 
for nefarious purposes.  The methods of software piracy 
described in the report include industrial-level falsification 
which originates in large foreign production centers that 
package the products as the original to mislead the consumer, 
the small-scale local copying operations (consumer knows the 
product is counterfeit), hardware integrators who copy software 
on to computer hard drives for sale, corporate piracy where 
unauthorized copies of licensed software is distributed 
throughout the organization, and on-line piracy. 
 
17.  The CPI\'s proposals for combating software piracy center 
on the modifications legislation on penal procedures, the 
\"Codigo de Processo Penal.\"   The changes would eliminate the 
need for the police to analyze each seized product, allow 
associations of right holders to legally store or warehouse 
seized goods, and allow associations of rights holder to allege 
violations and thereby precipitate legal investigations. 
 
Auto parts, Pay TV and Notebooks 
-------------------------------- 
 
18.  Piracy in the auto parts sector has its roots in foreign 
(Asian) production of counterfeit products smuggled into 
Brazil.  Job losses, increasing numbers of auto accidents and 
tax evasion are the result of piracy that has taken over 10% of 
the market, according to the CPI report.  The packaging and 
national distribution of falsified parts is centered in Sao 
Paulo state, and the CPI again recommends tighter customs 
inspections and state-conducted vehicle inspections to combat 
the crime.  Pay TV and telecommunications systems piracy 
involve organized crime as well as the individual users 
stealing signals, extending cables or using decoders.  The 
report describes piracy of distribution networks, TV as well as 
telephone, in low-income areas or favelas as a powerful tool of 
organized crime to subjugate entire communities, citing the 
case of a known criminal organization in Sao Paulo that has 
mounted and operates a clandestine telephone network.  The CPI 
recommends further study of the problem by law enforcement. 
 
19.  The CPI\'s investigation of illegally imported Toshiba 
notebooks or laptop computers started with allegations received 
by the Special Action Group to Repress Organized Crime (GAECO). 
The complaints alleged that several Brazilian companies import 
laptops from the U.S. without meeting Brazilian legal 
requirements or paying required tax, and sell the products via 
classified ads and the Internet.  The report goes into detail 
about seized documents and equipment, and alleges that the 
software on the notebooks was also pirated.  Again, 
recommendations center on more thorough customs inspections. 
 
Miscellaneous Chapters 
---------------------- 
 
20.  The report includes a chapter entitled \"a multifaceted 
view of piracy,\" which attempts to delve beyond the surface of 
piracy (the poor vendor, the poor consumer, and the indifferent 
low-level authority) to assist the citizen in understanding the 
harm/dangers involved, the rubric of the informal economy 
versus legitimate small business, and the international 
implications.  The deputies take the position that each country 
needs to judge the effectiveness of its intellectual property 
rights regime, stating that \"rights that aid development should 
be preserved and rights that entail more costs than benefits 
should be avoided.\"  Law Kin Chong (ref A) merits a separate 
chapter, while another chapter details the names and criminal 
activities of several private individuals and officials linked 
to cases investigated by the CPI, including Federal Deputy 
Pedro Correa (PP-PE), Federal Judge Joao Carlos Da Rocha 
Mattos, civil and federal police officials in Sao Paulo, and 
notorious cigarette smuggler Roberto Eleuterio da Silva (aka 
Lobao).  The CPI identifies over one hundred individuals and 
businesses involved in allegedly criminal activity related to 
piracy or tax evasion in its report.  In order to facilitate 
potential USG investigations, including efforts to cancel U.S 
visas, post will inform Department and law enforcement agencies 
of specific information contained in the report via septel. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
21.  The depth and breadth of the CPI\'s investigations are 
impressive, and the unprecedented scrutiny directed at the 
responsible authorities and Brazilian society at large deserves 
praise.  The close working relationship with the Brazilian 
private sector contributed greatly to the investigations and 
recommendations, and the frequently cited link between 
unrealized national economic development and piracy ring true 
for many in the GoB.  The report demonstrates the deputies\' 
desire to produce a document that will serve as an educational 
tool, a means to reach out to Brazilians and affect positive 
change.  Attempts to create a legally-sanctioned working group 
to pursue the criminal cases developed with the CPI\'s 
assistance underscore the deputies\' commitment, as well as a 
desire to disprove the naysayers that discounted the high- 
profile arrests as political grandstanding at the expense of 
law enforcement authorities. 
 
22.  The CPI correctly admits that its recommendation of a 
national plan to combat piracy draws greatly from the goals 
professed in the establishment of the Interministerial 
Committee (CICP).  The report does not offer reasons for the 
CICP\'s failure to make significant progress against piracy, but 
simply notes that the time has come to seek another option.  As 
the current President of the CICP has often told us, the fight 
against piracy in Brazil remains a question of resources.  The 
CICP has not received sufficient funds, let alone high-level 
support, to fulfill its mandate, and a new national plan will 
face the same obstacle.  Despite the dedication of a few in the 
executive and legislative branches, it is still not clear where 
anti-piracy efforts will fall on the long list of competing GoB 
priorities.  If the attention the CPI report receives propels 
the issue further up the list, this alone would be a major 
victory.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, BR, Domestic Politics 
SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN JUDGE OPENS NEW EXCEPTION TO ABORTION BAN 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  On July 1, a judge on the Brazilian 
Supreme Federal Court issued a temporary ruling allowing 
pregnant women whose fetuses suffer from anencephaly (not 
having a brain) to undergo an abortion.  This ruling is now 
in force, but to become permanent it must be approved by the 
full Court.  Brazil is the world\'s largest Catholic country, 
and Church leaders have criticized the ruling and are 
studying ways to challenge it.  The decision creates only the 
third legal exception to Brazil\'s abortion ban (threat to the 
life of the mother and pregnancy resulting from rape being 
the others).  Despite being illegal, abortion is common here 
and one study reported that 31% of Brazilian pregnancies end 
in abortion.  Thus the most likely long-term outcome of the 
debate is that the abortion ban will remain largely in place 
--with certain exceptions-- and will continue to be widely 
flouted.  END SUMMARY 
 
ABORTION BAN HAS TWO EXCEPTIONS 
------------------------------- 
2. (U) The Brazilian penal code, dating to 1940, bans 
abortion as a crime punishable by up to three years\' 
imprisonment for the health provider and the mother.  There 
are two exceptions: when the pregnancy results from rape or 
in order to save the mother\'s life.  Prosecutions are rare 
and international organizations estimate there are from 1.4 
to 3 million illegal abortions per year in Brazil.  A 1996 
report estimated that 31% of Brazilian pregnancies end in 
abortion and that the majority of women seeking abortions are 
married.  While the law specifies no such exception, since 
1991 individual Brazilian judges have authorized an estimated 
350 abortions in cases of anencephaly.  None of these rulings 
has been challenged to the high court. 
 
CURRENT CASE - LIMITED TO ANENCEPHALICS 
--------------------------------------- 
3. (U) In the current case, the National Confederation of 
Health Workers (CNTS -an association of a million physicians 
and nurses) filed the petition with the high court in order 
to obtain greater legal security when treating anencephalic 
cases.  CNTS\'s petition pointed out that because anencephalic 
fetuses are not viable outside the womb, the procedure would 
not be abortion but rather \"anticipating the birth\".  In his 
ruling, Supreme Court Judge Marco Aurelio de Mello agreed, 
noting that forcing a woman to carry a fetus that could not 
survive imposed undue psychological harm and medical risk, 
violating her constitutional rights to dignity, choice and 
health.  His temporary ruling applies to all anencephaly 
cases nationwide until the full court can hear the case when 
it returns from recess in August.  The decision also suspends 
any ongoing charges against health workers for previous 
abortions of anencephalics. 
 
4. (SBU) On a parallel track, Senator Duciomar Costa 
(PTB-Para) has drafted a bill that would specifically make 
anencephaly the third exception to the abortion ban.  That 
bill is in the Senate\'s Justice Committee but may not become 
law for several months, if ever.  Costa told us that he 
drafted the law a few months ago to protect health workers 
from oppressive prosecutions, but that he is personally 
opposed to abortion on religious grounds.  He has no plans to 
expand the proposed exception from the narrow case of 
anencephalic fetuses to a broader exception for unviable 
fetuses regardless of medical condition.  The Senator seemed 
surprised by the vociferous opposition of the Catholic 
Church, and said that he will consult with Church leaders and 
may \"rethink the bill or withdraw it altogether\". 
 
5. (SBU) Deborah Diniz, Director of the ANIS bioethics NGO in 
Brasilia, filed an amicus brief on CNTS\'s behalf.  Like 
Senator Costa, she told us she is focused narrowly on 
anencephalic cases and has no plans to expand the legal 
exception to include other medical conditions.  She is not 
aware of any prosecutions of health workers specifically in 
anencephalic cases.  Diniz believes the Supreme Court 
petition offers a better and quicker resolution of the issue 
than waiting for legislation to pass Congress. 
 
CATHOLIC CHURCH TO APPEAL 
------------------------- 
6. (U) The Brazilian Catholic Bishops\' Conference (CNBB) 
opposes the ruling.  CNBB Vice President, dom Pedro Scherer, 
told the press, \"This ruling is lamentable, an assault on the 
lives of anencephalic fetuses... There is the risk that, 
little by little, other similar and analogous situations will 
be seen as permissible for abortion\".  CNBB President dom 
Geraldo Majella has contacted the federal Prosecutor-General 
requesting that he challenge the ruling and also issued a 
statement saying, \"CNBB will exert every effort to invalidate 
this isolated decision and will struggle for the preservation 
of the rights of anencephalics, especially the right to be 
born.\" 
 
COMMENT - LAWS THAT DON\'T TAKE HOLD 
----------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) While Brazilians tend to be open-minded, this is the 
world\'s largest Catholic country, and the Church not only 
opposes the ruling, but sees it as potentially the tip of the 
iceberg in terms of creating more exceptions for a range of 
medical conditions.  But another Supreme Court Justice, Celso 
de Mello, praised Judge Marco Aurelio\'s ruling, saying, \"The 
magistrate who imposes absolute religious neutrality to the 
Brazilian State, cannot subordinate his decisions to 
principles of moral theology, no matter how worthy.\"  In the 
long run, both views are likely to win out.  Brazilians point 
out that their books are full of laws that \"don\'t take hold\" 
(\"nao pega\"), and the abortion ban is one example.  The most 
likely outcome is that, whether or not the entire Supreme 
Court upholds the ruling, that Brazil\'s abortion ban will 
remain largely in place and will continue to be widely 
flouted.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/13/2013 
TAGS: MARR, PREL, BR, KICC, POL-MIL Issues 
SUBJECT: BRAZIL: PURSUIT OF ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT 
 
REF: (A) STATE 145167 (B) BRASILIA 1291 
 
Classified By: DepPolCouns Lawrence Cohen, reasons: 1.4 (b & d) 
 
1.  (U)  In separate meetings, poloff delivered ref A points 
outlining continued USG interest in concluding an Article 98 
agreement with Brazil to Ministry of Foreign Relations (MRE) 
U.S.-Canada Division Chief Paulo Alvarenga and to MRE United 
Nations Division Chief Carlos Duarte. Both Alvarenga and 
Duarte had participated in the May U.S.-Brazil Pol-Mil 
bilaterals (ref B) and were familiar with the Article 98 
issue. Alvarenga deferred comment to Duarte, whose office has 
the lead on Article 98. 
 
2. (C) Referring to the Article 98 discussions during the May 
bilaterals, Duarte reiterated Brazil\'s strong support for the 
ICC -- a position reflected, he said, in domestic public 
opinion.  Because of this depth of commitment, Brazil would 
not undermine its \"ICC membership obligations.\"  However, 
Brazil\'s own loyalty to the ICC, Duarte felt, did not 
preclude the possibility that a mutually-acceptable 
alternative to an Article 98 agreement could be found. 
Repeating a long-standing GOB position, Duarte commented that 
neither he nor his superiors could conceive of any occasion 
where Brazil would subject U.S. citizens on Brazilian soil to 
ICC jurisdiction.  He added that there was a perception in 
Brazil of excessive USG militancy towards the ICC, although 
USG concerns that led to this position were clearly 
understood by the GOB. He said he hoped the United States, in 
the future, would be less confrontational towards the Court. 
 
4.  (C)  Brazil, he emphasized, remained eager to work out a 
solution.  He suggested the USG consider submission of 
another proposal with a modified text referring exclusively 
to U.S. military and official personnel rather than American 
citizens.  Poloff responded that, with ninety Article 98 
agreements already signed with various nations the USG 
probably would not consider much alteration of the standard 
Article 98 agreement text. Poloff added that senior USG 
policymakers remained keenly focused on this issue and would 
not be reluctant to raise it in meetings with their Brazilian 
counterparts. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  Brazil\'s commitment to the ICC is genuine 
and robust, but MRE officials do not want conflict with us 
over the Article 98 issue -- they understand clearly our 
specific national concerns and also worry about a U.S. 
withdrawal over time from international peacekeeping because 
of those concerns. Duarte\'s comments above suggest the GOB 
wants to leave the door open to some sort of compromise, and 
GOB assurances that under no imaginable scenario would 
American citizens be extradited from Brazil to the ICC appear 
sincere.  The question then emerges as to what form a 
compromise might take -- options might include a specific 
bilateral agreement that accomplishes our goals but does so 
outside the standard Article 98 format, or inserting 
non-extradition language into a broader DCA or SOFA document 
were Brazil to demonstrate openess to negotiating such 
bilateral agreements.  Such options would not be easy, quick 
or certain to succeed, but they may merit further 
consideration.

1.(SBU) SUMMARY. After a tough and dramatic semester, the 
first congressional session of 2004 ended on July 13. 
Despite beginning three weeks early and ending two weeks 
late, this session\'s results were modest at best.  The 
Waldomiro Diniz scandal, poor economic results from 2003, and 
divisive debates over the minimum wage and the term lengths 
of Congressional leaders created a lack of focus, and Lula 
and his coalition contributed with several tactical blunders. 
 No major bills were passed this session, though several 
--including the Bankruptcy bill, Public-Private Partnerships, 
and the Biosecurity bill-- made significant progress through 
the legislative wickets.  With Brazil\'s economy apparently on 
the rebound and political attention now turning towards the 
October municipal elections, Lula\'s slipping approval numbers 
may stabilize or improve in the coming months, but there is 
no sign that the administration has moved to improve its 
strategic approach to passing its agenda.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CONGRESS IN NEAR-CONTINUOUS SESSION SINCE EARLY 2003 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
2. (SBU) The 2004 first semester session of the Brazilian 
Congress, marked by controversy and high drama, ground to a 
halt on July 13, two weeks after its scheduled end --this is 
the third of three recesses that have been truncated during 
the 52nd Congress.  The legislature is now in recess until 
August 2, but the upcoming session will operate in low gear 
until the nationwide municipal elections conclude on October 
31.  In 2003, Lula\'s new government worked hard to pass its 
keystone pension and tax reform bills.  So hard, in fact, 
that Lula canceled Congress\'s July recess last year and held 
the Members in extraordinary session.  Thus, by late 2003, 
Congress was understandably ready for its two-month holiday 
recess, with many Members planning international travel. 
Then Lula cut short that recess also, calling Congress into 
extraordinary session on January 19 in a futile attempt to do 
some heavy lifting before the scheduled opening on February 
15.  On January 23, Lula reshuffled his cabinet, bringing 
five Congressmen into the administration, including several 
from the PMDB party.  Lula hoped, vainly as it turned out, 
that cementing the PMDB\'s place in his coalition would smooth 
passage of his priority projects through Congress. 
 
SCANDAL SET STAGE FOR ADMINISTRATION DEFEATS 
-------------------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) On February 13, the \"Waldomiro Diniz Scandal\" broke, 
in which an advisor to Lula\'s powerful Chief-of-Staff, Jose 
Dirceu, was videotaped soliciting bribes from a numbers 
racketeer.  The scandal dominated the headlines for seven 
weeks.  A March 30 disclosure that a prosecutor seemed to be 
pursuing the case largely for political reasons (ref A) took 
the wind out of the case, and the government coalition 
managed to head off calls for a congressional inquiry.  By 
then, however, Dirceu was damaged and the administration\'s 
authority in Congress was weakened.  The scandal, as well as 
poor 2003 economic results that were trickling in, 
reinvigorated the opposition and set the stage for a series 
of administration defeats.  Lula\'s coalition was also cursed 
with particularly maladroit Congressional leadership, and the 
President tarnished his own image by fumbling his response to 
a critical May 9 New York Times article (ref B). 
 
4. (SBU) On May 5, the opposition in the Senate managed to 
kill Lula\'s proposal to close bingo parlors, which had been 
his clearest response to the Waldomiro scandal (ref C).  The 
same day, the opposition initiated a series of maneuvers 
attacking Lula\'s small increase in the minimum wage (from 
R$240 to R$260 per month).  By the time the dust settled on 
June 23, Lula\'s increase remained intact but the opposition 
had enjoyed seven weeks of press coverage accusing him of 
being more interested in IMF fiscal targets than Brazil\'s 
working class.  Opposition candidates will carry this message 
into October\'s municipal elections. 
 
SESSION HAD FIREWORKS BUT LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENT 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
5. (SBU) Thus there were plenty of fireworks this session, 
and the opposition repeatedly pushed Lula\'s coalition into a 
corner.  As a result of the time and energy spent on the 
Waldomiro scandal and the minimum wage debates (as well as a 
divisive and futile debate over allowing the leaders of 
Congress to remain in their posts for four years instead of 
two), Congress failed to pass any of the significant bills on 
its plate.  Some items made progress, while others were 
simply pushed onto next year\'s notional calender.  In the 
meantime, congressional leaders complained that Lula was too 
quick to issue Presidential Decrees (which have the force of 
law, but require Congressional ratification to remain in 
force --and which clog the congressional calendar while 
awaiting ratification).  But given the political challenges 
for Lula to pass his legislation, issuing Decrees offered him 
a mechanism to move forward on some elements of his agenda. 
Among the key bills that did not pass: 
 
- Biosecurity bill to regulate biotechnology, including GMO 
soy, which remains illegal here.  For the past two years, the 
GoB has issued waivers allowing farmers to plant and sell 
their GMO soybeans, but an overdue bill to regulate the 
sector faces an impasse in the Senate, and another waiver is 
likely to be issued in the coming weeks to legalize the 
2004-05 soy crop. (ref D). 
 
- Public-Private Partnership bill to generate funding for 
infrastructure projects is bogged down in a Senate committee, 
where there are questions about the bill\'s accounting 
mechanisms and impact on city and state budgets.  If a deal 
can be reached, this bill may pass in August. 
 
- Judicial Reform to streamline the judiciary.  This bill had 
been stalled by opposition from the Supreme Court Chief 
Justice who retired in May (ref E).  Parts of the text have 
passed the Senate, but more work remains to be done. 
 
- Bankruptcy bill, closely watched by investors, passed both 
houses but in different forms, so it must now go back to the 
Chamber for a final vote, possibly in August. 
 
- Other legislation, including the final pieces of last 
year\'s pension reform and a bill to combat the use of slave 
labor also failed to pass into law but made progress and 
could pass by year\'s end. 
 
RECESS GUARANTEED BY MINIMUM WAGE DEAL 
-------------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Congress\'s final act on July 13 was to pass a 
mandatory, but preliminary, budget piece called the Law of 
Budgetary Directives (LDO).  This year\'s LDO sparked interest 
because it includes an amendment that will avert a partisan 
battle next year over the minimum wage increase.  Under the 
law, next year\'s minimum wage hike will be indexed to the sum 
of inflation and per capita GDP growth.  The administration 
was divided over this amendment but eventually acceded.  On 
the one hand it does not wish to have its fiscal hands tied 
by a pre-fixed minimum wage hike (and indexing was a major 
culprit in the hyperinflation of the early 1990s).  On the 
other hand, Lula is loathe to endure another bruising battle 
over the minimum wage. 
 
COMMENT - NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP 
------------------------------ 
7. (SBU) The failure of the Brazilian Congress to pass key 
laws this session was due to a combination of factors that 
weakened the administration\'s hand:  the Waldomiro scandal, 
poor economic results, lame whip work in Congress, rebellious 
coalition partners, and an opposition not only emboldened by 
these weaknesses, but given incentive to capitalize on them 
in advance of the October municipal elections.  While the 
session was disappointing to some, it was not an utter 
failure.  It seems likely that the coming months will be a 
bit better for Lula.  Some of the key bills left hanging fire 
during this recess should pass, and economic statistics 
suggest improved growth through year\'s end.  One interlocutor 
noted that Lula\'s dipping approval numbers could recover as 
the middle class regains some of the confidence it lost 
during the first semester\'s travails, but that the working 
class --those most affected by stubbornly high unemployment-- 
may remain disillusioned until employment numbers improve. 
An economic rebound would give a bounce to the government and 
strengthen its hand in congress, but there is no sign that 
the administration has fixed the structural problems in the 
coalition.  The nine main parties in the coalition often do 
not share legislative priorities nor do they maintain 
internal discipline on votes --another significant 
contributing factor to this session\'s disappointing results. 
Better tactics and a clearer strategic vision for its agenda 
would have gone a long way to averting the serial crises of 
the past few months, yet the administration seems 
surprisingly inactive in addressing these shortcomings.

TAXATION OF INTERNATIONAL FLOWS 
 
REF: USUN 1593 
 
This cable is Sensitive But Unclassified, please protect 
accordingly. 
 
1. (U) Summary:  Brazil, in coordination with France, Chile 
and Spain, is preparing for circulation this month a set of 
proposals for new mechanisms to finance international 
development, health and anti-hunger efforts, primarily 
through the UN agencies.  These proposals would be presented 
for discussion by heads of state at a meeting President Lula 
is calling on September 20, on the margins of the UN General 
Assembly.  The financing mechanisms under discussion focus 
largely, but not exclusively, on taxation by national 
authorities of international financial flows and arms sales. 
Proceeds would be forwarded to the UN development agencies. 
Other financing mechanisms floated include a carbon emission 
tax, the promotion of socially-responsible investment funds 
and reducing taxation of remittances. 
 
2. (SBU) The Brazilian effort flows in large part from 
Lula\'s personal experience of hunger and poverty as a child, 
according to Maria Nazareth, the GoB point-person on the 
initiative.  Acknowledging that there are serious obstacles 
to implementing this sort of taxation, Nazareth claimed the 
GoB approach, and that of their partners, is pragmatic, more 
focused on increasing resources available for development 
efforts than on specific financing mechanisms.  The 
financing effort, according to Nazareth constitutes the 
third broad thrust of GoB international development efforts, 
along with efforts to reduce agricultural subsidies through 
the G-20 and Lula\'s effort to amend how the IMF accounts for 
certain investment expenditures.  End Summary. 
 
3. (SBU) Emboff met July 13 with Maria Nazareth, of Foreign 
Minister Amorim\'s staff, who is spearheading President 
Lula\'s international anti-hunger initiative.  Nazareth 
explained that Lula\'s initiative, like his trademark 
domestic \"Zero Hunger\" program, grew out of his personal 
experience of hunger and poverty as a child in Brazil.  Lula 
recognizes, she said, that getting at the root causes of 
hunger implies a broad development agenda.  Shortly after 
his inauguration in January 2003, Lula attempted to launch 
at the Davos conference that year the idea of an 
international foundation to fight hunger and finance 
development.  But, after an extensive conversation with 
French President Chirac at the G-8 Evian conference in the 
summer of 2003, Lula realized that the problem was less an 
issue of an appropriate foundation but rather the lack of 
resources, particularly long-term financing, for the use of 
the various United Nations development, health and related 
agencies.  From this encounter, according to Nazareth, was 
born a joint Brazilian-French effort, which the governments 
of Chile and Spain later joined, to identify or create 
financing sources. 
 
4.  (SBU) Lula and Chirac, Nazareth said, discussed during 
their Evian conversation a modified Tobin tax on 
international financial flows as one possible financing 
source.  The idea, Nazareth stressed, is not to replace 
Official Development Assistance (ODA), but rather to create 
mechanisms that help make up for the developed world\'s 
failure to meet the 0.7% of GDP ODA target.  Chirac 
reportedly created a study group, known as the \"Landau 
group\" to begin studying various forms of international 
taxation, she said.  In addition to a Tobin-style tax on 
international financial flows, a proposal for a tax on major 
weapon systems was also being advanced.  Some have discussed 
an international carbon emission tax, although Nazareth said 
the latter proposal had stirred up considerable doubts, 
since it would make development itself more expensive. 
 
5.  (SBU) The Brazilian group that Nazareth heads is 
focusing in particular on a tax on international financial 
transactions and a separate one on arms sales.  Nazareth 
stressed that everyone involved in the discussions is 
cognizant that universal participation would be necessary 
for such taxes to work.  All it would take is one country 
outside the system for evasion to occur.  She acknowledged 
that this need for universality required pragmatism.  They 
had canvassed existing studies, she said, to find approaches 
that might be modified and made widely palatable.  The Tobin- 
style tax, for example, would be set at 0.01% of financial 
flows and not structured, as a true Tobin tax would be, to 
try to reduce financial market volatility.  The studies in 
question have suggested that a 0.01% tax on financial 
transactions would yield from $17 - $20 billion per year.  A 
tax on large weapons systems sales, notionally at a 5% rate, 
might yield a further $10 billion, although work on this 
proposal was less advanced than that on financial flows. 
Nazareth argued that the latter tax, to the extent it 
reduces weapons sales, might have positive externalities by 
reducing the threat that terrorists might gain access to 
advanced weaponry. 
 
6.  (SBU) Elucidating on the legal basis for these taxation 
schemes, Nazareth said that the ideas floated to date do not 
call for international taxation administered by the UN. 
Rather, national authorities would collect these taxes and 
forward them for use by UN development and health agencies. 
Discussion of how this could be accomplished was ongoing, 
but the most logical approach seemed to be for an 
international convention that countries would sign and 
ratify. 
 
7.  (SBU) Along with obligatory taxation, several 
\"innovative\" financing mechanisms are also under discussion, 
according to Nazareth.  These include the promotion of 
socially-responsible investment funds and making widespread 
the use of \"incentive\" credit cards, that donate a 
percentage of the transaction to a cause, in this case the 
UN development agencies.  These might be accompanied, she 
said, by two voluntary efforts to build political consensus 
to reduce taxation of immigrant labor remittances (after 
receipt in the worker\'s home country) and to reduce tax 
evasion by reducing the role of tax havens.  More 
controversially, a carbon tax had also been considered.  At 
a rate of $0.48/liter of gas, such a tax would raise $130 
billion world wide, Nazareth said.  She acknowledged that, 
by making energy more expensive, such a tax might make 
development itself more costly. 
 
8.  (SBU) Looking ahead at next steps in the process, 
Nazareth said that representatives of the governments of 
Brazil, Chile, France and Spain would meet again July 28 in 
Paris.  They would then circulate for initial comment a set 
of papers that they hope would form the basis for discussion 
at the heads of state level in a meeting Lula has called for 
September 20, on the margins of the General Assembly. 
Nazareth emphasized that, from the GoB\'s point of view, the 
effort is designed to stimulate broad discussion and 
ultimately increase resources available for UN sponsored 
development efforts.  Nazareth said that the financing 
effort is the third broad thrust of GoB international 
development efforts, along with efforts to reduce 
agricultural subsidies through the G-20 and Lula\'s effort to 
amend how the IMF accounts for certain investment 
expenditures. 
 
9.  (SBU) Comment:  The GoB\'s interest in this subject 
appears to be serious, not just rhetorical, hence Nazareth\'s 
repeated acknowledgement of the need to take a pragmatic 
approach.  The example of Lula\'s call for the IMF to change 
how it accounts for investment expenditures may be both 
instructive and predictive.  After initial public fanfare, 
in which Lula scored some PR points on the IMF issue, the 
technicians at the Finance Ministry sat down to try to map 
out an approach that would not spook the markets.  Their 
effort started from the clear recognition that accounting 
shifts won\'t solve Brazil\'s debt problem or fool the 
markets.  A senior finance ministry official assured Emboff 
recently that what Brazil is now aiming at is achieving 
political consensus, within the IMF and without, for greater 
investment in the expenditure mix while maintaining the same 
level of fiscal restraint.  This represents a substantial 
change from initial characterizations of the effort.  The 
key point, however, is that the GoB\'s intent has been in 
stimulating change, even if they do not get all their 
initial public rhetoric indicated they are seeking.

SUBJECT: EDITORIAL DECRIES LULA\'S TRADE-NEGOTIATOR 
CHANGES 
 
 
1. In the wake of the GoB\'s surprise walk-out from 
Mercosul-EU trade talks in Brussels July 21 (Septel), 
Brazilian media focused heavily on the fact that Brazil\'s 
negotiating team had abruptly changed chiefs just the 
preceding week, with Brasilia-based Regis Arslanian 
displacing long-time Ambassador to Brussels and ace trade 
expert Jose Alfredo Graca Lima.  From the start of Lula\'s 
GoB, Arslanian (who is considerably junior to Graca Lima) 
has been identified with the trade-policy ideology of 
Foreign Minister Amorim and Deputy Samuel Guimaraes, 
commonly seen as distinct from that of the senior trade 
diplomats under Lula\'s predecessor.  Itamaraty (Foreign 
Ministry) officials including Amorim himself have 
unconvincingly asserted that protocol rules caused Graca 
Lima to be dropped from the GoB delegation and that the 
switch has no import for policy.  The broad informed local 
sense is that the truth lies elsewhere, as charged in an 
editorial of the July 22, 2004 \'O Estado de Sao Paulo.\' 
Following is Embassy\'s unofficial translation of the 
editorial in question. 
 
2. (Begin Text of Unofficial Embassy Translation) 
 
(HEADLINE) Tarnishing Itamaraty\'s Image 
 
Over the past two decades, the Foreign Ministry has been 
putting forth a generation of diplomats highly specialized 
in trade negotiations.  This team\'s competence is 
recognized in all international fora and constitutes a 
valuable asset to Brazilian diplomacy. 
 
Since we are at a critical moment in negotiations on three 
fronts - ALCA, Mercosul-European Union and World Trade 
Organization - it would be natural that these diplomats 
would be at the front of missions that defend Brazilian 
interests.  But this is not what happens. 
 
One by one, these highly qualified diplomats, experienced 
in the tough game of trade negotiations, are being removed 
from their areas of specialization and replaced by 
professionals of lesser intellectual brilliance, experience 
and capacity for initiative, better able to follow to the 
letter the minute (exact) instructions coming from the 
Chancery.  The diplomats who have been removed have in 
common the fact of having served in prominent positions 
during the government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso and are 
committed, in some way, to the process of trade integration 
and economic opening inherent to globalization.  And that 
is not, decidedly, the objective of President Luiz Inacio 
Lula da Silva\'s foreign policy, formulated primarily by his 
international adviser, Marco Aurelio Garcia, and by the 
secretary-general of Itamaraty, Ambassador Samuel Pinheiro 
 
SIPDIS 
Guimaraes.  Underlying this political shortsightedness is 
the fear - motivated by an inferiority complex, we would 
say, that a commercial association with the great economic 
powers of the world leaves Brazilian producers and 
consumers vulnerable to greater foreign competitive 
capacity, forgetting that Brazil is among the 15 largest 
economies of the world and is capable of competing, on at 
least equal terms and conditions, in agricultural and 
industrial markets worldwide.  Proof of this are the 
repeated records achieved by the trade balance and that are 
not due - contrary to what the defenders of national- 
statism would wish - to a policy of import-substitution, 
but rather to the dynamism of the export sector. 
 
The result of the change in negotiators is a new policy 
turned towards the attempt to conclude South-South trade 
agreements on a priority basis, that is, with countries 
with few trade opportunities to offer Brazil.  To make 
matters worse, this is ruining the image that Brazilian 
diplomacy always had in international fora, caused by the 
inexperienced performance of some novice negotiators.  One 
example has entered the annals of international jokes - the 
intervention of an ambassador having received tasks beyond 
his capabilities who, during an Alca ministerial meeting 
held in Puebla, said to his foreign colleagues that he 
would very much like to see documents elaborated during the 
Uruguay Round of GATT, but didn\'t know how to do it - 
getting the stinging retort - \"look on the internet\". 
 
The cycle of exchanging trade negotiators - for the worse - 
was completed recently with the removal of Ambassador Jose 
Alfredo Graca Lima from the delegation that represented 
Brazil in the highest technical instance of negotiations 
between Mercosul and the European Union.  Ambassador Graca 
Lima, currently head of the Brazilian mission to the 
European Union, had accumulated 30 years experience in 
trade issues.  He was head of the Itamaraty\'s Economic 
Department.  He accompanied the entire Uruguay Round and 
afterwards specialized in OMC issues, remaining in Geneva. 
He participated in launching the project that culminated 
with the Mercosul-European Union negotiations, which he 
never stopped following.  With all this experience, he was 
removed from the Brazilian delegation, now headed by 
Ambassador Regis Arslanian, who was promoted to the highest 
career post only a month ago. 
 
It is by removing Brazil from the principal trade currents 
- those that make economic growth and technological 
development possible - and relegating the best trade 
diplomats to simple protocol functions, that the Lula 
government intends to change world economic geography. 
 
There\'s ideological prejudice, and there\'s pettiness!

SUBJECT: MERCOSUL/EU TALKS BREAK-OFF: NOT JUST A BRAZILIAN 
\"TACTIC\" 
 
 
This Cable is Sensitive but Unclassified. Please Protect 
Accordingly. 
 
1. (U) Top GoB negotiators on Wednesday July 21 abruptly 
broke off EU/Mercosul trade talks in Brussels and returned 
to Brazil leaving only lower-level staff to continue 
eventual exchanges on technical parameters or detail.  The 
GoB move was a reaction to the EU\'s latest agricultural 
market access offer, presented on Monday, which the 
disappointed Brazilians at once denounced as a retreat from 
the previous EU offer.  Inter alia, the Europeans reportedly 
conditioned the ultimate definition of their agricultural 
tariff/quota offers upon WTO Doha Round developments, and 
made explicit that previously proposed agricultural-import 
quotas would be phased-in, backloaded, over ten years. 
 
2. (SBU) By all local accounts and appearances, the walk-out 
came precipitously and shocked the Europeans -- as well as 
Brazilian media and observers who have been fed a steady 
recent diet of glowing GoB affirmations about achieving a 
Mercosul-EU trade agreement before Lamy leaves his post in 
October.  It probably also caught much of the GoB\'s own 
fifty-plus negotiating team on the hop.  CAMEX (Foreign 
Trade Chamber) executive secretary Mario Mugnaini, en route 
to Brussels with the latest input from Brazil\'s private 
sector after a Lula meeting with businessmen, landed to find 
his trip OBE\'d. 
 
3. (U) As of Friday July 23, the declared GoB view is that 
the walk-out was a necessary tough tactic to force the EU to 
talk turkey about farm trade.  \"The agricultural offer is 
the one that justifies this negotiation. Parceling out the 
quotas makes the agricultural offer inexistent...The time 
has come, once and for all, for the Europeans to understand 
that they need to improve their agricultural offer,\" in the 
words of the GoB delegation\'s new chief, Regis Arslanian. 
Local reports cite the Europeans in turn as claiming that 
the ten-year phase-in intention was previously notified and 
blaming Mercosul\'s \"inflexibility\" for the suspension of 
negotiations.  Arslanian\'s EU counterpart Karl Falkenberg 
noted that \"Parceling is normal and it is, for example, in 
our agreements with Chile and Mexico.\"  No doubt the EU also 
has cause for its own complaint that Mercosul\'s offers (or 
lack thereof) on industrial trade, services and investment 
fall comparably short of what European interests require. 
 
4. (U) Both sides have underscored that negotiations have 
not been called off.  However, at least in Brazil it now 
seems broadly expected that the main hope for their 
resumption hinges on next week\'s events vis-a-vis Doha Round 
negotiations.  The always-optimistic Mugnaini has been 
quoted as suggesting that a ten-year phase-in period for the 
quotas might actually be acceptable, as long as the quotas 
themselves were steeply raised, but Itamaraty has since 
issued an apparent disavowal. 
 
5. (SBU) In a development whose possible correlation with 
the negotiations\' progress has been lost on no-one here, 
Arslanian last week unexpectedly displaced veteran GoB trade 
negotiator and Ambassador to Brussels Graca Lima as head of 
the Mercosul team.  Itamaraty spokesmen up to and including 
Foreign Minister Amorim assert there was no policy import to 
this personnel shift.  Nobody seems to accept this, and a 
July 22 `Estado de Sao Paulo\' editorial (Septel) reflected a 
common view in calling Graca Lima\'s sidelining just the 
latest in a series of ideologically-motivated underminings 
of Brazil\'s best trade diplomats since Lula\'s 
administration, and the new top Itamaraty leadership, took 
over. 
 
6. (U) Media have highlighted that Agriculture Minister 
Rodrigues and Industry Minister Furlan both made calls of 
solidarity to Graca Lima.  (NOTE:  U/S Larson heard of the 
Brussels breakdown in his July 21 meeting with Rodrigues, 
who expressed surprise at the development, but did not offer 
a view as to how far-reaching its effect would be.  END 
NOTE.)  Otherwise, general reaction in Brazil seems to have 
been to feel vaguely let-down, but irresolute.  The National 
Agricultural Confederation (CNA) was forthright in 
protesting the Mercosul walk-out, but the National 
Confederation of Industries (CNI) considered it \"sensible.\"

7.  (SBU) Itamaraty made this disruption happen, but should 
be feeling very uneasy.  It has invested enormously in 
promoting the line that Brazil can gain improved trade 
conditions vis-a-vis developed countries with or without 
FTAA.  So far, its institutional returns for doing so under 
Lula have been rich.  Now, though, Amorim and Guimaraes face 
the prospect of the ballyhooed EU/Mercosul pact proving a 
chimera, disappointing the expectations that they themselves 
fueled.  Their best hope at this point may be the chance of 
last-minute WTO success in overcoming the Doha Round 
impasse.  Absent that, Amorim may have to choose between 
outright failure to get any Mercosul/EU agreement at all by 
October, or signing an \"agreement\" that is transparently 
pallid.

1. (SBU) Summary:  In meetings across Brasilia September 21, 
U/S Larson made clear to GoB interlocutors that while the USG 
shares Brazil\'s deep commitment to fighting hunger on a 
global scale, elements of President Lula\'s anti-hunger 
initiative that call for international taxation were 
non-starters from the U.S. point of view.  Larson argued 
against mechanisms that might try to short circuit 
legislative oversight of funding decisions.   Noting that he 
wants to ensure that the U.S. and Brazil work together to 
develop specific and practical areas of cooperation, Larson 
presented a nonpaper containing U.S. suggestions.  Thirty 
heads-of-state have accepted Lula\'s invitation to a September 
20 meeting in New York in advance of the UNGA to explore ways 
to increase development finance, according to the Brazilians. 
 Foreign Minister Amorim reiterated that President Bush is 
invited as well.  While the agenda for the September 20 
meeting is to discuss innovative financing mechanisms, the 
GoB reps stressed that their overriding goal is simply to 
reenergize the international dialogue on the issue.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) In a July 21 call on Foreign Minister Amorim, which 
was preceded by extensive discussion with Amorim\'s Chief of 
Staff Antonio Patriota and advisor Maria Nazareth Farani, U/S 
Larson stated that the USG and GoB shared a common interest 
in fighting hunger and promoting development on a global 
scale.  He expressed confidence that, despite clear 
differences of views on some of the financing mechanisms 
under discussion, the USG and GoB could identify areas, such 
as agricultural development, anti-hunger efforts and the 
fight against HIV/AIDs, in which they could enhance 
cooperation.  Amorim stressed that Lula\'s initiative is 
serious and comes \"from the heart,\" given his personal 
experience of hunger and poverty as a child.  He welcomed USG 
willingness to engage on the issue. 
 
3. (SBU) According to GoB point-person Farani, Brazil is 
elaborating along with Chile, France and Spain a paper that 
they hope will serve as a basis for discussion at the 
September 20 heads-of-state meeting.  Patriota and Farani 
said that Lula recognizes that fighting hunger on a 
sustainable basis implies a broad development agenda.  The 
GoB initiative aims to increase both the level and 
predictability of development financing above and beyond 
current ODA levels by identifying new financing sources. 
These monies would finance the work of the UN development 
agencies, which work within the framework of the UN 
Millennium development goals.  Farani noted a recent World 
Bank report on progress towards those goals called for an 
additional USD 50 billion of ODA per year in order to achieve 
them.  The overriding GoB goal for the September 20 meeting, 
Patriota said, is to reenergize the international dialogue on 
development finance. 
 
4. (SBU) Turning to the substance of the initiative, Farani 
said that the first part envisions the taxation of 
international financial flows and major arms sales.  These 
taxes would not be administered by a supranational authority, 
she said, but rather by national authorities coordinating 
their work internationally (see Ref A for a more extensive 
discussion).  The initiative\'s framers envision this regime 
as mandatory, since ensuring compliance would require 
universal adherence by countries.  This modified Tobin-tax 
would be notionally set at 0.01% of international financial 
flows, a figure estimated to yield about USD 17 billion. 
 
5.  (SBU) Farani added that a second, voluntary, part of the 
initiative would involve the promotion of socially 
responsible investment funds and making widespread the use of 
\"incentive\" credit cards, that donate a percentage of the 
transaction to a cause, in this case the UN development 
agencies.  A third piece of the initiative envisions building 
political consensus to reduce the cost to immigrant 
communities of transmitting remittances home, which fees, 
Farani said, can be as high as 20%.  Farani noted that while 
in New York recently, Lula launched a new service that would 
substantially reduce the cost of remitting money to Brazil. 
A second focus of the political consensus-building effort 
would build on work being done in the OECD to reduce tax 
evasion by reducing the role of tax havens. 
 
6. (SBU) One of the very important conclusions of the 
Monterrey Development Summit, Larson stated, was the need to 
look at all resources for development comprehensively. 
Developing country exports amount to around USD 2 trillion. 
Foreign direct investment flows and remittances contribute 
additional significant amounts.  Together, these privately 
generated flows dwarf ODA.  The USG shares the goal of 
increasing ODA, Larson said, and expects by 2006 to have 
increased its own ODA by 75%.  The increase in U.S. ODA, 
Larson pointed out, was accomplished by convincing Congress 
of its importance.  The USG has serious concerns with 
efforts, such as the IFF proposal, that appear to be attempts 
to circumvent the legislative process.  A debate over 
international taxation, Larson stated, would likewise 
distract attention from what has been a very successful 
effort to increase ODA.  The USG is nevertheless open to the 
sort of dialogue and exploration that the GoB had identified 
as one of the goals of its initiative. 
 
7. (SBU) Turning to specifics of potential bilateral 
cooperation to fight hunger on a global scale, Larson said he 
hoped Brazil would consider joining the food aid convention. 
Brazil\'s agricultural expertise, language and cultural ties 
to Lusophone Africa might facilitate joint efforts to help 
those African countries\' agricultural development, Larson 
said.  He emphasized that the trade policy agenda in the WTO, 
where the USG and GoB share the goal a more open trade regime 
in Africa, must complement these efforts. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment:  While perhaps disappointed that they did 
not change the USG view on taxation of international flows, 
these GoB representatives welcomed the constructive tone of 
the meetings.  We do not expect major changes in GoB rhetoric 
on the initiative, but their recognition that the taxation 
schemes are not workable without universal participation may, 
in time, change its substance.

IMPOVERISHED QUILOMBOS

1. SUMMARY. As it struggles to find resources to implement 
programs from agrarian land reform to Zero Hunger, the 
government of Brazil faces another challenge to its busy 
social agenda in bringing Brazil\'s quilombos (communities 
originally founded by fugitive slaves) into the modern world. 
 The task of integrating quilombos into society is difficult 
because it presents economic, race, and social challenges. 
Almost half of all Brazilians describe themselves as being of 
African descent, giving Brazil the second largest Black 
population in the world behind Nigeria.  Afro-Brazilians 
represent a disproportionate number of the nation\'s poor. 
(Brazilian race relations are covered in a series of Mission 
reports, see Refs A and B.)  Quilombo residents tend to be 
abjectly poor, educated to the fourth grade, and living in 
communities only tenuously linked to infrastructure grids. 
 
2. President Lula\'s quilombo agenda has made considerable 
strides in addressing quilombo problems, but much more is 
needed.  Unfortunately, resources restrictions mean that 
quilombos will not make significant progress in the 
short-term.  On July 10-11, Poloffs visited Kalunga, a 
quilombo in northern Goias state, 250 rugged miles north of 
Brasilia.  Poloffs found Kalunga to be much like other 
quilombos: impoverished and without land title.  END SUMMARY. 
 
KALUNGA, MUCH THE SAME AS 300 YEARS AGO 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. On July 10-11, Poloffs, along with Claudio Braga of the 
National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform 
(INCRA), the GOB agency responsible for implementing land 
reform policies; and Bernedete Lopes of the Palmares Cultural 
Foundation, the GOB agency charged with registering and 
protecting quilombos, visited Kalunga.  Kalunga is the 
largest quilombo in Brazil with 4,000 inhabitants spread 
across three municipalities, occupying over 625,000 acres. 
The quilombo was founded by escaped slaves from the 
neighboring state of Minas Gerais who dispersed their 
communities in remote locations to avoid capture.  For almost 
300 years, Kalungans lived in cultural and geographical 
isolation.  Contact with the outside world began in the 
1980s.  Since then, Kalunga has welcomed curious researchers 
and tourists, including President Lula who visited the 
quilombo in March 2004. 
 
4. Kalunga runs much as it did three centuries ago, with a 
backward economy based on subsistence agriculture and barter. 
 Not surprisingly, Kalunga is plagued by abject poverty. 
Basic sanitation, health care, and education are slow in 
coming.  None of the mud huts or brick homes we visited had 
indoor plumbing.  Currently, the Palmares Foundation is 
developing several sanitation projects in the community. 
Doctors, visits to the remote quilombo are infrequent and 
hospitals are largely inaccessible.  The purchase of three 
vans to shuttle patients to neighboring clinics is the most 
recent improvement in health care.  Educational opportunities 
are limited, as schools in Kalunga go up to only the fourth 
or fifth grade and classes are overcrowded.  In one area, a 
teacher with only a fifth grade education instructs grades 
one through four.  Few parents can afford to send their 
children to neighboring cities for further education.  The 
desire for more educational and employment opportunities 
lures young Kalungans off the quilombo.  According to one 
resident, not one Kalungan youth who has managed to go to 
university has ever returned to the quilombo. 
 
BRAZIL\'S LARGEST QUILOMBO TO GET LAND 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. Kalunga will soon gain title to the land it has occupied 
for centuries.  On June 30, the GOB announced that it would 
transfer land to Kalunga using federal and state funds for 
indemnification.  The announcement came almost five years 
after Goias state officially recognized Kalunga,s authority 
over the 625,000 acres.  The delay in the title process was 
caused by both structural and financial deficiencies. 
Although the GOB recognizes quilombo land as sites of 
national heritage to be protected under the Constitution, 
only recently has the GOB developed a clear plan and funding 
to transfer land to quilombos. 
 
THE STATE OF QUILOMBOS 
---------------------- 
 
8. Kalunga,s economic and social problems are indicative of 
quilombos.  There are 746 registered quilombos (with hundreds 
more believed to exist unregistered) with more than 2 million 
people spread across 24 of Brazil\'s 26 states.  Most of these 
communities are impoverished and without land title.  In 
March 2004, the Palmares Foundation and the University of 
Brasilia published results of a joint study on 156 quilombos. 
 The study showed that the lack of access to basic 
sanitation, treated water, and health care has led to the 
spread of diseases.  Food security is a major concern, as the 
agrarian communities are vulnerable to extremes in weather 
conditions.  There are few schools, and those in operation 
are inadequate.  According to the Palmares Foundation, only 
150 of the 746 quilombos have schools.  The lack of 
infrastructure is one of the biggest impediments to 
integrating quilombos into modern society and lifting them 
from poverty.  As in Kalunga, there are few roads connecting 
quilombos to nearby cities, making travel and commercial 
exchange difficult.  In addition, many quilombos do not have 
electricity or phone lines. 
 
9. Quilombo land reform has moved slowly.  In 1995 the first 
land title was transferred to a quilombo - seven years after 
the 1988 Constitution recognized quilombo land rights.  To 
date, only 72 of the 746 quilombos hold land titles. 
 
LULA\'S QUILOMBO AGENDA 
----------------------- 
 
10. President Lula is a champion of the quilombo cause. 
Since taking office, he has turned over the administration of 
quilombo land reform to INCRA, a more experienced agency in 
land issues than the previous administrator, the Palmares 
Foundation.  (Palmares continues to work in other areas of 
quilombos.)  The transfer of administration allows quilombos 
to be included in the National Plan for Agrarian Reform, 
issued by the GOB in November 2003 (Ref C).  The GOB has 
established measurable goals for quilombo land reform. 
INCRA, with assistance from the Palmares Foundation, is 
charged with completing thirty land transfers by the end of 
this year and 120 by the end of Lula\'s term in 2006.  Special 
training in handling quilombo land issues has recently been 
provided to INCRA personnel responsible for quilombos.  The 
GOB is also moving to include quilombos in the country\'s 
social welfare programs, recently making quilombos an area of 
priority for the government\'s Zero Hunger initiative. 
 
LULA\'S CHALLENGES 
----------------- 
 
11. The challenge the GOB faces in addressing these issues is 
resources.  There are only three INCRA members in each region 
of Brazil working on quilombo land reform.  The Palmares 
Foundation has only six people (most of who work from 
Brasilia) who cover a plethora of quilombo economic and 
social issues with a meager annual budget of R$ 1 million 
(approximately US$ 333,000).  According to INCRA, the dearth 
of resources and expertise often means that quilombos with 
major land conflicts or with large populations are serviced 
first. 
 
12. COMMENT:  Quilombos pose another challenge for the GOB in 
the area of race and poverty.  In a country where racial and 
socioeconomic inequity affects a majority of the population, 
there are never enough resources.  With weak political 
representation and no economic bargaining power, quilombos 
have no leverage to affect change in their own communities. 
As a result, they remain in danger of being prioritized low 
on the GOB\'s political agenda, even though President Lula has 
shown personal interest in helping quilombos, especially in 
the area of land reform.  However, granting land to quilombos 
is just the beginning.  To develop and modernize quilombos 
will require that the GOB, for years to come, pay special 
attention to these communities.  Public service facilities, 
utilities, job training, and infrastructure are just a few of 
the many basics quilombos still lack.  END COMMENT.

1.   (SBU) Summary:  In meetings with senior GoB officials 
and representatives of U.S. industry, U/S Larson emphasized 
that Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection was in 
the interests of both countries; he highlighted the losses 
that Brazilian artists and companies suffer from piracy. 
Larson expressed appreciation for the GoB\'s willingness to 
discuss actions that might be taken to improve IPR 
enforcement under the current 90-day extension of Brazil\'s 
access to benefits under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP).  Larson welcomed the GoB\'s high level of 
engagement in critical ongoing efforts to advance Doha Round 
World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations.  He urged 
Brazilian passage of a science-based biotechnology law. 
 
2.   (SBU) Minister of Development, Industry and Foreign 
Trade Furlan expressed concern that, despite growth in 
absolute levels of trade, the U.S. and Brazil had both seen 
their shares of each other\'s markets fall.  Furlan and his 
Secretary for Industrial Development, Roberto Jaguaribe, 
 
SIPDIS 
outlined the GoB\'s efforts to strengthen the Intellectual 
Property Institute (INPI) through staffing increases and 
equipment modernization.  They urged that the USG recognize 
these efforts and maintain Brazil\'s GSP access.  Both Furlan 
and Agricultural Minister Rodrigues were optimistic that 
progress would be made this month in reinvigorating Doha 
Round negotiations.  Foreign Ministry Economic Division 
Chief Tarrago said that while the GoB is hoping for a Geneva 
Doha Round breakthrough, it has some concerns with the 
Oshima text and about whether sectoral negotiations might be 
made mandatory.  Rodrigues was surprised at the recent break- 
off of EU-Mercosul FTA negotiations and said he was 
particularly disappointed with the back-loading of increased 
agricultural access within the 10-year phase-in period 
contained in the EU\'s latest offer (Ref B).  End Summary. 
 
3.   (U) Background: During a July 20-21 visit to Brazil, 
U/S Larson met in Sao Paulo with representatives of a cross 
section of U.S. businesses and in Brasilia with senior GoB 
officials to discuss the full breadth of the bilateral 
economic agenda.  He met with Minister of Development, 
Industry and Foreign Trade Luiz Furlan and his Secretary of 
Industrial Development (and newly-nominated INPI President) 
Roberto Jaguaribe to discuss trade and IPR.  Larson also met 
with Agriculture Minister Rodrigues, Congressman Julio 
Semeghini, one of the leading figures of the Congressional 
Investigatory Commission (CPI) into IPR piracy, and Foreign 
Ministry officials, including Economic Division Chief 
Piragibe Tarrago and Chief of Scientific, Technical and 
Technological Cooperation Antonino Marques Porto.  Ref A 
reported on U/S Larson\'s conversations concerning President 
Lula\'s hunger initiative.  Septel reports on Larson\'s 
meetings with Central Bank President Meirelles and Finance 
Ministry and Finance Ministry Executive Secretary Bernard 
Appy and International Secretary Luis Pereira on the broader 
economic situation and the reform agenda. 
 
IPR and GSP 
----------- 
 
4.   (SBU) In Sao Paulo, U/S Larson attended a dinner with 
10 senior representatives of U.S. companies operating in 
Brazil, including representatives of the banking, 
pharmaceutical, energy, agriculture, construction, and 
consumer-products sectors.  On IPR, the consensus was that 
Brazil\'s current legislation was good, but enforcement 
remained a serious problem.  A pharmaceutical-sector 
representative noted that serious backlogs remain in patent 
processing, and that the Intellectual Property Institute 
(INPI) has been starved for resources and leadership.  He 
expressed hope that the naming of a new INPI president 
(Roberto Jaguaribe) would result in operating improvements. 
 
5.   (SBU) In his meetings in Brasilia, U/S Larson 
emphasized the cost of piracy to Brazil, both directly to 
Brazilian industry and indirectly in lost tax revenues to 
the GoB.  U.S. business estimates of its losses to piracy 
($745 million), Larson noted, give an idea of the scope of 
the problem.  He welcomed the GoB\'s willingness to discuss 
actions under USTR\'s current 90-day extension of its review 
of Brazil\'s GSP access.  The USG wants to work 
collaboratively and quietly with the GoB on practical ways 
to address the problem, Larson stated. 
 
6.   (SBU) Minister Furlan stated that Brazil wants to 
maintain its GSP privileges.  Furlan claimed that his naming 
of the Secretary of Industrial Development, Roberto 
Jaguaribe, to be double-hatted as President of INPI, was a 
measure of the importance he attaches to the issue. 
Jaguaribe outlined the GoB\'s current efforts to improve 
INPI\'s functioning.  INPI has an increased budget, it is 
hiring additional patent examiners, renovating the building, 
investing in new information technology and restructuring 
the organization.  Jaguaribe stated he is in contact with 
Commerce U/S Dudas to explore cooperation between INPI and 
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
 
7.   (SBU) Jaguaribe argued that Brazil\'s patent backlog is 
an operational issue while copyright and trademark problems 
are both operational and enforcement issues.  By renovating 
INPI the GoB believes that it will create awareness of the 
IPR issue and thus enhance its ability to protect copyrights 
and trademarks.  Jaguaribe and U.S. Under Secretary of 
Commerce Dudas have discussed enforcement and patent 
cooperation programs.  Minister Furlan added that the GoB is 
studying special tax treatment for software, IT services, 
and computer hardware and capital goods that the GoB 
believes will act as a development incentive as well as a 
way to reduce piracy by making pricing of legitimate 
software more competitive. 
 
WTO Doha Round 
-------------- 
 
8.   (SBU) Larson welcomed Brazil\'s high level of engagement 
in efforts to advance the Doha Round.  Ministers Furlan and 
Rodrigues both expressed optimism that a deal could be 
reached this month.  Itamaraty Economic Division Chief 
Tarrago said the GoB had some specific concerns with the 
Oshima text currently being discussed in Geneva.  The GoB 
opposes making sectoral negotiations mandatory, Tarrago 
said.  This, along with agriculture, are the biggest issues 
for developing countries, he said.  The Oshima text did not 
go as deep into detail on these issues as developing 
countries expected, Tarrago cautioned. 
 
9.   (SBU) Minister Rodrigues stated that he understands 
that developed countries like the United States must 
maintain subsidies to protect their farmers, but argued that 
this support should not result in an exportable surplus. 
Such surpluses hurt developing countries that can\'t provide 
domestic subsidies.  The Undersecretary responded that he 
agrees with the principle of eliminating export subsidies 
and hopes that one result of the Doha Round will be to 
decouple payments from production.  He believes this is 
possible because of strong commercial interests and because 
it is a development issue. 
 
 
Bilateral Trade Issues 
---------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) Minister Furlan expressed concern that, despite 
growth in absolute levels of trade, the U.S. and Brazil had 
both seen their shares of each other\'s import markets fall. 
Furlan said he had discussed this \"under-performance\" with 
Commerce Under Secretary Aldonas the previous month and that 
both agreed on a positive bilateral agenda for cooperation 
to increase trade.  Larson argued that working together on 
the FTAA could help address the fall-off in market share. 
 
11.  (SBU) Ethanol.  Furlan stated that Brazil wanted a 
level playing field in the U.S. ethanol market.  U.S. 
ethanol producers receive a 50% rebate on excise taxes and 
subsidies of 54 cents per gallon that create barriers to 
Brazil\'s sugar cane-based ethanol.  Furlan proposed allowing 
Brazil to export ethanol to California, a market that is a 
long distance from U.S. Midwestern ethanol producers. 
Larson noted that strong U.S. Congressional interest in corn- 
based ethanol production made a change in policy difficult. 
Only a negotiation on the scale of FTAA or the Doha Round, 
which had scope for broad-based trade-offs, would offer any 
chance for an outright change.  Larson also invited the GoB 
to try to show how they could grow the U.S. ethanol market 
so that Brazilian imports did not displace current U.S. 
production.  Furlan said he would like to invite Senator 
Grassley to visit Brazil to gain insight into the local 
ethanol industry. 
 
12.  (SBU) Shrimp, Fresh Beef and Soybeans.  Furlan, and 
separately Itamaraty\'s Tarrago, urged that the USG dismiss 
claims of dumping of farmed shrimp on the U.S. market by 
producers in Brazil\'s poor northeastern region.  Larson 
noted that a decision would be made towards the end of the 
month.  Tarrago also raised the issue of access to the U.S. 
market for Brazilian fresh (non-processed) beef.  Larson 
reassured Tarrago that while the USDA rule-making process 
might be lengthy, it was objective and scientifically sound. 
Larson related to Rodrigues that the USG recently had 
delivered a formal demarche to the Government of China 
protesting its barring, on questionable phytosanitary 
grounds, of several soybean shipments, primarily from Brazil 
but also affecting U.S. shippers.  Rodrigues stated his 
personal belief that the real reason Chinese soybean 
processors had rejected the shipments was to take advantage 
of the drop in world soybean prices.  Rodrigues alleged that 
Chinese soybean processors were looking for a reason to 
break the (high-priced) contracts and \"we gave them one,\" in 
the form of shipments containing with relatively high levels 
of fungicide-treated soybean seeds. 
 
Biotech 
------- 
 
13.  (SBU) Larson urged Rodrigues to work for passage of a 
science-based law allowing the use of genetically modified 
(GM) crops.  Rodrigues said he leads the faction within the 
GoB that is in favor of the use of GM crops.  He told Larson 
that Congressional passage of a biosafety law, which would 
formalize the use of GM crops, may not occur in time for the 
planting season later this calendar year.  In the absence of 
a law, Rodrigues said, he had been able to convince the 
President to sign decrees, which provisionally allowed 
biotech soybean planting, but would expire this year. 
Rodrigues expressed confidence that the Congress eventually 
would pass a reasonably liberal biosafety law; he believed 
the Senate would reverse troublesome changes the Chamber of 
Deputies had made to the executive\'s original draft.  Those 
changes, however, would then need to go back to the Chamber. 
 
14.  (U) U/S Larson was unable to clear this message before 
departing Brazil.

previous weekend of improprieties in both Candiota\'s and 
Central Bank (CB) President Henrique Meirelles\' pre-2003 
Brazilian income-tax returns.  In Meirelles\' case, the chief 
accusation is simply that he should have filed a Brazilian 
tax return for 2001, i.e., that he was not entitled to claim 
physical residence in the U.S. from 1997 through 2001 as 
grounds for exemption from Brazilian income tax, since that 
year he registered himself with the Goias state electoral 
committee as locally domiciled -- a standard requirement for 
his planned 2002 race for a seat in Brazil\'s Congress. 
Meirelles defended himself in an immediate Central Bank press 
release, pointing out that he had paid all U.S. taxes due 
while living in the United States and asserting that he had 
merely maintained a domicile in Brazil for electoral 
purposes, which did not require him to pay Brazilian taxes 
during that period. 
 
2. (U) The charges against Candiota were of a different 
order, involving apparent multiple cases of unreported 
financial transfers, typically in the low-to-mid six figures 
(U.S. dollars), some of them to offshore tax havens, through 
a New York-based bank alleged to be a known money-laundering 
conduit.  Like Meirelles, Candiota also denied any illegality 
in his conduct.  However, he did not publicly offer specifics 
to rebut the allegations and apparent detail of documentation 
that he had hidden assets abroad.  In contrast to the 
immediate CB press release upholding Meirelles, the GoB made 
no public move on Candiota\'s behalf; in fact, comments on 
the case by Justice Minister Bastos were widely seen as 
having the opposite effect.  In his letter of resignation, 
Candiota stated that despite the allegations, untruth, he 
felt \"personally violated\" by them and was no longer willing 
to remain in the job under those circumstances.  He also 
argued it was best for him to leave quickly lest extended 
scandal harm the Central Bank or unsettle financial markets. 
 
3. (SBU) A senior advisor to the Central Bank Board gave no 
credence to the allegations against Candiota and Meirelles in 
a July 28 conversation with Emboff and argued that the media 
to-do over the two top CB figures was simply an example of 
election-year politics, driven by opposition efforts to 
discredit the Lula administration.  He predicted more of the 
same as October municipal elections draw near. 
 
4. (SBU) Simultaneous with the announcement of Candiota\'s 
resignation, Meirelles, after consultation with Finance 
Minister Palocci, nominated CSFB Managing Director Rodrigo 
Azevedo to replace him.  Azevedo is well and favorably known 
to the Embassy and to Consulate Sao Paulo as a keen, and 
orthodox economic analyst with impeccable academic 
credentials.  His nomination has drawn universal plaudits 
from the financial community, and markets responded calmly 
both to Candiota\'s resignation and replacement.  The 
nomination will require Senate confirmation, tentatively 
scheduled for the second or third week of August.  At this 
point the only obvious obstacle to a quick confirmation is 
the greater difficulty of obtaining a quorum during this 
electoral season. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: Candiota\'s exit is plainly a GoB effort 
quickly to put this scandal in the past, and defuse any 
danger to Meirelles himself, which at this stage seems to be 
the likely outcome.  Had these charges surfaced 
two-and-a-half months ago, amidst the sustained bad economic 
news and criticism of the Central Bank\'s tough monetary line 
that prevailed at the time, it might have caused serious 
political and market damage.  But the improved economic data 
and trends since then give the GoB and Meirelles much more 
political leeway.  Indeed, the very fact that the GoB gave 
Meirelles full authority to pick Candiota,s replacement 
usefully reinforces the perception of de facto Central-Bank 
autonomy, even in the absence of formal CB \"independence,\" 
which Finance Minister Palocci recently re-announced as a key 
prospective GoB legislative goal for 2005.

1.   (SBU) Summary:  U/S Larson congratulated Central Bank 
President Henrique Meirelles and senior Finance Ministry 
officials on the success of Brazil\'s macroeconomic 
stabilization after the 2002 financial crisis.  Larson noted 
investor concerns about the electrical sector, the judicial 
system and arbitrary actions by the governor of Parana that 
had affected U.S. investment, and urged the GoB to build an 
climate that could attract investment to meet pressing 
infrastructure needs.  Larson also urged the GoB to join the 
Capetown Convention on Aircraft Financing. 
 
2.    (SBU) Meirelles highlighted the strength of Brazil\'s 
current recovery, which has been export and capital-good- 
spending led.  The healthy external balance and fact that 
price-pressure is under control makes this recovery much 
more sustainable, according to Finance Ministry Executive 
Director Appy.  Export growth in particular has surprised 
everyone.  The GoB also is pursuing an ambitious agenda of 
microeconomic reform, including a new law on Public-Private 
Partnerships (PPPs), which should attract needed investment. 
Appy and Meirelles acknowledged the damage inflicted on 
Brazil\'s investment climate by Governor Requiao of Parana, 
but pointed out that the judicial system lately has begun to 
reassert itself and reversed some of Requiao\'s actions.  The 
GoB plans to address some persisting energy-sector investor 
concerns as it drafts the regulatory framework implementing 
the new energy model.  End Summary. 
 
3.   (U) Background: During a July 20-21 visit to Brazil, 
U/S Larson met in Sao Paulo with representatives of a cross- 
section of U.S. businesses and in Brasilia with senior GoB 
officials to discuss the full breadth of the bilateral 
economic agenda.  He met with Central Bank President 
Henrique Meirelles, Central Bank Director for International 
Affairs Alexandre Schwartsman, Finance Ministry Executive 
Secretary Bernard Appy and International Secretary Luis 
 
SIPDIS 
Pereira to discuss the economic situation and reform agenda. 
Ref B reported on U/S Larson\'s meetings on IPR and trade 
issues.  Ref A reported on U/S Larson\'s conversations on 
President Lula\'s hunger initiative. 
 
Dinner with U.S. Business Community 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.   (SBU)  In Sao Paulo, U/S Larson attended a dinner with 
10 senior representatives of U.S. companies operating in 
Brazil.  The banking, pharmaceutical, energy, agriculture, 
construction, and consumer-products sectors were 
represented.  Larson solicited the business representatives\' 
views on the GOB\'s macroeconomic policy, the investment 
climate, President Lula\'s domestic and international anti- 
hunger initiatives, and the prospects for sustained growth 
in Brazil.  There was consensus that several key factors 
significantly increase the cost of operating in Brazil and 
deter foreign direct investment:  the failure to enforce 
contracts, due in part to the sluggish and unpredictable 
judicial system; lack of a clear and transparent regulatory 
environment, in particular in the energy and agricultural 
biotechnology sectors; and high and complex taxes.  The high 
cost of capital for domestic investment was also identified 
as a major drag on growth.  The poor transportation 
infrastructure was flagged by agribusiness participants as 
an obstacle to further growth in Brazil\'s best-performing 
export sector. 
 
5.    (SBU) The business representatives indicated support 
for the Lula administration\'s macroeconomic policy, and 
expressed confidence in Finance Minister Palocci and his 
economic team.  They were cautious, however, about the 
prospects for sustained growth and expressed serious 
reservations about the prospects for establishing a stable, 
transparent regulatory regime.  Energy-sector 
representatives expressed frustration with the GOB\'s 
proposed new energy model, in particular the provisions that 
would provide preferential conditions for new investors in 
the sector, prejudicing those firms that entered the market 
during the first wave of parastatal privatizations in the 
1990s.  Most participants expressed doubt that the GOB\'s 
initiative to establish public-private partnerships would 
succeed in attracting much new FDI, in the absence of 
regulatory certainty.  While they lauded the economic team, 
they expressed disappointment with the overall level of 
competence and ideological bent of most of Lula\'s cabinet 
and subcabinet appointees.  They attributed the failure of 
Lula\'s flagship Zero Hunger program and other social 
programs to get off the ground to the administrative 
inexperience of the senior officials in the social 
ministries. 
 
Stabilization, Inflation and Potential Growth 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6.    (SBU) Larson congratulated Meirelles and Appy, in 
separate meetings, on the GoB\'s very successful 
stabilization after the financial crisis of 2002.  Now that 
interest rates had come down and growth seemed to be 
returning, there is room to focus on what Brazilian 
potential growth might be and what inflationary threats are 
out there.  Larson noted U.S. efforts to convince OPEC oil 
ministers to increase production to help reduce the 
inflationary threat to the world economy from oil prices. 
Unfortunately, there is not much spare global capacity, he 
said, and that which exists is concentrated in Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait and the UAE.  OPEC, Larson said, appears to have 
settled on a new price band of $28 to $36. 
 
7.   (SBU) The potential growth rate of the Brazilian 
economy, Meirelles said, is unclear.  He argued that the 
astounding performance of Brazilian exports might be 
instructive, albeit the analogy was imperfect.  When we 
embarked on our efforts to increase exports, many doubted it 
could be done, noted Meirelles, citing infrastructure 
bottlenecks and the relatively low level of investment by 
Brazilian business in product development and distribution 
mechanisms.  Nevertheless, export growth has surprised 
everyone.  Meirelles argued everyone had underestimated the 
positive effects of the establishment of a predictable 
macroeconomic framework anchored to an inflation target and 
fiscal primary surplus.  Even the 1994 Real Plan, while 
delivering low inflation, had been anchored to an 
unsustainable exchange-rate peg.  The consistent pursuit of 
these goals since 1999, Meirelles said, along with the 
reduction of exposure to exchange-rate linked debt, had 
reduced volatility and uncertainty.  This confidence in the 
policy framework, in turn, spurred investment in product 
development and distribution channels, contributing to the 
current export boom. 
 
8.   (SBU) Meirelles noted that spending on capital goods 
was one of the factors leading the current economic 
recovery.  Central Bank International Director Schwartsman 
pointed out that this is the first time in recent memory 
that capital-goods spending had been so robust so early in a 
cyclical recovery.  He attributed this in part to high 
capacity utilization in industry, particularly those linked 
to exports, which had forced investment in additional 
capacity to meet growing demand.  The economy had created 
one million formal sector jobs in the first half of 2004, 
according to Schwartsman.  He expected investment to reach 
20% of GDP by year-end, up from 18% of GDP in the first 
quarter of 2003 and 19% in the first quarter of 2004.  There 
was less certainty about the behavior of productivity, but 
Schwartsman believed it to be trending upwards, particularly 
as Brazilian industry became more exposed to competition 
from trade. 
 
Reform Agenda and FDI 
--------------------- 
 
9.   (SBU) Appy stated that the macroeconomic policy 
framework was about right, and did not require major 
adjustment.  He argued that Brazil is in a situation in 
which growth can be sustained, given the healthy external 
balance and that price pressures are under control. 
Consistent growth, however, required increases in investment 
and in productivity, Appy stated.  Given the GoB\'s fiscal 
situation, Brazil needed as much private-sector investment 
as it could obtain.  The GoB agenda, therefore, included 
prompt passage of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) law 
that would create a framework for private investment in 
major infrastructure projects.  Pereira enumerated several 
other initiatives, including the new bankruptcy law, 
incentives for innovation, judicial reform, creating 
incentives for participation in formal labor markets, 
deepening of credit markets, and reduction of red tape for 
opening a business, all of which also are high on the GoB 
reform agenda. 
 
10.  (SBU) Larson asked whether the GoB was concerned by the 
fall-off in FDI.  He noted cases of arbitrary actions by the 
governor of Parana and concern over electricity-sector 
regulation.  Larson emphasized the importance of creating an 
investment climate where businesses already in-country 
become the best advocates for further FDI.  This was 
particularly important to meet government investment 
priorities through initiatives such as PPP. 
 
11.  (SBU) Schwartsman noted that a certain amount of 
reduction in FDI flows was to have been expected with the 
conclusion of the privatization program.  He estimated that 
between a third and a half of FDI during the peak of 
privatization was linked directly to foreign purchases of 
parastatals or follow-on investments in those enterprises. 
Meirelles noted that the change of management that 
accompanied privatization had resulted in large productivity 
gains. 
 
12.  (SBU) Both Meirelles and Appy acknowledged that the 
governor of Parana had done serious damage to Brazil\'s 
investment climate with his various steps to re-negotiate 
existing contracts.  Appy pointed out that Brazil\'s judicial 
system was now beginning to reassert itself and that its 
latest decisions had gone against the Parana state 
government.  Meirelles called for judicial reform in order 
that the system deal more sure-handedly with cases such as 
that of Parana\'s governor. 
 
13.  (SBU) Appy stated that the energy sector in particular 
was troubled.  In the aftermath of the 1998 devaluation, 
energy companies, many of them newly-purchased in 
privatizations, had been unable to service their dollar- 
denominated liabilities.  Along with poorly-written 
contracts, judicial decision limiting price increases 
exacerbated the sector\'s problems.  Appy said the GoB is 
attempting to address, through the new energy model\'s still- 
evolving regulatory framework, the complaint of existing 
investors in the energy sector that they were being 
disadvantaged vis-a-vis new investment.  Larson noted the 
importance of investors\' having confidence in the 
independence and objectivity of the regulatory agency. 
 
14.  (SBU) Larson urged Appy and Pereira to consider joining 
the Capetown Convention on Aircraft Financing.  He also 
emphasized the importance of competition through trade in 
increasing potential growth. 
 
15.  (U) U/S Larson was unable to clear this message before 
his departure from post.

SESSION

     B. BRASILIA 1144 
     C. BRASILIA 1670 
     D. BRASILIA 1834 
 
1. (SBU)  Judge Nelson Jobim, who in May rotated into a 
two-year stint as Chief Justice of the Brazilian Supreme 
Federal Court (STF), is already putting his stamp on the 
court\'s way of doing business (ref A).  On July 30, Jobim 
marked the end of the July recess by doing something no other 
Chief Justice has ever done:  he announced the court\'s agenda 
for August.  As expected, several key cases are in line for 
decisions this month, ranging from a ruling on taxing 
pensioners that could unhinge the administration\'s pension 
reform plan to challenges to the recently unveiled Energy 
Model. 
 
2. (SBU) Jobim\'s announcement of the court\'s agenda not only 
offers transparency and predictability to the press and 
public, but to the other ten Justices as well.  One 
prerogative of each judge is the right of \"review\" a case, 
i.e., to pull it from the docket at any time, including while 
the other justices are issuing their rulings.  These 
\"reviews\" may last several weeks or months and generally 
occur on the most important cases when judges are under 
particular pressure.  Chief Justice Jobim hopes that by 
announcing the agenda well in advance, he will reduce the 
number of time-consuming \"reviews\".  Jobim plans to issue 
weekly updates to the agenda. 
 
3. (SBU) Key cases on the Supreme Federal Court\'s docket this 
session: 
 
- ENERGY MODEL.  Set to be heard August 4, two constitutional 
challenges filed by the opposition PSDB and PFL parties to 
the GoB\'s Energy Model that was enacted by Presidential 
Decree in December 2003.  That Decree is now pending 
Congressional ratification.  The petitions charge that the 
new rules for the energy sector violate consumer rights.  The 
Court\'s discussions have been suspended by a judge\'s request 
for a review. 
 
- CLOSING BINGO PARLORS.  Scheduled for August 5, a petition 
filed by the Federal Prosecutor-General challenging states\' 
authority to reopen bingo parlors nationwide.  The high 
court\'s ruling will decide parallel cases in eleven states. 
The issue derives from February\'s \"Waldomiro Diniz\" scandal, 
in which an advisor on Lula\'s staff was caught soliciting 
bribes from a numbers racketeer.  In response, Lula issued a 
Presidential Decree closing all bingo parlors nationwide, but 
the Senate rebelled on May 5 and refused to ratify the 
Decree, so several states allowed the gaming parlors to 
reopen (ref B). 
 
- CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES.  A petition filed by the 
opposition PFL party seeks to open a congressional inquiry 
(CPI) into the Waldomiro scandal.  At the scandal\'s height, 
Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) and its allies successfully spiked 
the inquiry by simply not nominating any members, preventing 
it from forming for lack of quorum.  The PFL\'s petition on 
the legality of this tactic was set to have been heard last 
June when the scandal was on the front pages, but one judge 
requested a \"review\", so the case is now slated for August. 
 
- TAXING RETIREES.  Scheduled for August 18, a decision on 
whether retirees\' pensions can be taxed.  If the Court rules 
against taxing retirees, it could reverse the most important 
element of Lula\'s pension reform plan, under which the GoB is 
expected to garner an estimated R$ 1 billion (about US$ 330 
million) in annual revenues.  This case could also have 
wide-ranging impact on whether the constitution can be 
amended in other areas with fiscal consequences.  The 
11-member Court was in the middle of voting on the case in 
June when several judges requested a \"review\", suspending the 
vote, which was running 3 votes to 1 against Lula\'s reform. 
 
- AUTHORITIES OF THE PROSECUTOR\'S OFFICE.  Set for September 
is a ruling on the investigative authorities of the Public 
Prosecutor\'s Office (Ministerio Publico).  The Constitution 
gives the Prosecutor\'s Office near-total autonomy to pursue 
cases but expressly grants investigative authorities only to 
the police.  In the wake of several high-profile, and 
allegedly politicized, investigations by the Prosecutor\'s 
Office, the high court is being asked by a Federal Deputy who 
is under investigation for corruption to limit prosecutors\' 
investigative authorities.  In a similar case last October, 
Judge Jobim ruled against the prosecutors. 
 
- ABORTION.  Set for late September is a full court decision 
on a high court judge\'s preliminary ruling on July 1 that 
would open a narrow exception in the abortion ban to allow 
women carrying fetuses with anencephaly (not having a brain) 
to legally obtain abortions (ref C). 
 
- GUN CONTROL.  The high court also has pending four 
challenges to the December 2003 \"Disarmament Law\" that 
enacted tough limits on citizens\' rights to own and carry 
firearms (ref D). 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
4. (SBU) Judge Nelson Jobim appears to be more dedicated to 
transparency and efficiency than his insular predecessor as 
Chief Justice, Mauricio Correa, with whom he often clashed. 
After seven years on the high court and three months as Chief 
Justice, Jobim is building a reputation as a modern jurist 
committed to improving both the functioning of the judicary 
and the quality of its decisions.  The simple act of 
announcing in advance the court\'s agenda is emblematic of his 
style.  Jobim also presided over the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal that deftly handled the 2002 national elections.  A 
Judicial Reform bill that would enact significant, if not 
sweeping, changes to the Brazilian judiciary is now in the 
Senate and set to become law in the coming months, and Jobim 
has pronounced himself favorable to this bill.

SUBJECT: INTERAGENCY DELEGATION DISCUSSES 
INFORMATION-SHARING REGARDING BRAZIL\'S SHOOTDOWN PROGRAM 
(CORRECTED COPY) 
 
 
Classified By: Pol Consul Dennis W. Hearne for Reasons 1.5a 
 
1.     (C)  Summary and Introduction.  On July 30, a 
State/DoD delegation, led by WHA PDAS James Derham, met with 
Brazilian Ministry of Defense interlocutors to discuss 
mechanisms through which the GOB would provide information to 
the USG about the status of Brazil,s  shootdown program once 
that program begins.  The two sides generated a working text 
that would provide the USG timely access to GOB data (i.e., 
reports and video/audio tape) in cases where Brazilian 
interceptors employed lethal force.  In addition, the GOB 
committed to providing the USG with: a) notification of any 
substantial changes to program procedures and training 
requirements, and b) the opportunity for periodic 
consultations that might address the number of events that 
stop short of lethal force and the date and location of such 
events. 
 
2.  (C)  Both sides agreed to take the working text back to 
their respective interagency processes for a more complete 
review.   The GOB will produce, in Portuguese, the official 
version of the working text, by the middle of the week of 
August 2.  State will generate an English version of that 
document shortly thereafter.  The USG delegation proposed 
that, when finalized, the document and two annexes that 
detailed the GOB\'s procedures, would serve as attachments to 
an exchange of diplomatic notes, that would be initiated by 
the GOB.  In its current form, the exchange would represent a 
political commitment on the part of the GOB, as opposed to a 
binding international agreement. End Summary and Introduction. 
 
3.  (C)  Fernando Abreu, Chief of Staff of Defense Minister 
Viegas, led the Brazilian delegation, which consisted of 
Orlando Almeida (Special Advisor to Viegas), Air Force 
Brigadier General Machado (Sub-Chief of Operations of the MOD 
Joint Staff), and Air Force Colonel Servan (Vice-Chief of the 
GOB Air Defense Command).  After welcoming remarks, Abreu 
noted that the GOB planned to initiate its shootdown program 
on October 17, with great emphasis being placed on 
transparency for both the Brazilian public and foreign 
governments.  He then turned the floor over to General 
Machado, who launched into an extended description of 
Brazil,s air defense infrastructure and the procedural 
safeguards associated with the GOB,s implementation of 
shootdown.  In particular, Machado noted that: 
--  Since 1979, the GOB had been safely conducting air 
interceptions (i.e., approaches short of lethal force), and 
was well aware of the need to scrupulously observe ICAO 
requirements during the course of aerial interception.  The 
use of lethal force, he emphasized, was merely an extension 
of the GOB,s current interception efforts. 
--  Brazil,s operational norms for its airspace defense 
system were contained in a large classified document known as 
the NOSDA (the Portuguese acronym).   Though the Air Force 
was not able to provide the USG with a copy of the NOSDA, he 
emphasized that the documents that were passed to the 
delegation representatives during the course of the July 29 
talks, in addition to the GOB\'s two sets of responses to the 
USG\'s questions about GOB shootdown procedures, were accurate 
summaries of the contents of the NOSDA.  (In brief, these 
summaries describe a process of detection, monitoring, 
identification, interrogation, investigation, and warnings 
prior to the use of lethal force, as well as the procedures 
and circumstances under which the GOB would use lethal 
force). 
--  The use of both warning shots and lethal force would only 
be authorized by the Commander of Brazil,s central air 
defense center.  Lethal force would only be employed in cases 
where intel information indicated that the suspect air track 
was tied to narco-trafficking. 
--  The co-location of civil aviation facilities with 
military controllers, along with reliance on a common Air 
Force radar feed, facilitates the identification of routine 
civil aviation traffic. 
--  The GOB plans to conduct an extensive media campaign, 
using television and radio spots, sporting events, and 
notices to airmen (NOTAMs) to publicize the contemplated 
October 17 initiation of its shootdown program.  A parallel 
effort would be aimed at the international public as well. 
--  The training regime for program personnel includes 
training for pilots, air controllers, and communications 
personnel.  In particular, he noted, those pilots who conduct 
air interceptions receive more extensive and specialized 
training than their non-interception counterparts. 
 
4.  (C)  Subsequent discussion then refined the mechanism 
through which the USG would receive information about program 
events.  Abreu noted that the GOB was open to passing 
comprehensive information to the USG on an informal basis, 
but that any arrangement that smacked of USG intrusion into 
Brazilian sovereignty was a non-starter, given the 
potentially negative reaction by the Brazil congress and 
public.  Still, Abreu pledged that the GOB would: 
--  provide, on an urgent basis, the AmEmbassy Brasilia Air 
Force Attache with information regarding any shootdown 
incident.  Such information would be provided to the general 
public as well. 
--  At the USG,s request, meet with USG representatives to 
provide background information about the program,s progress 
(i.e., the number of suspect tracks detected, interceptions, 
and warning shots as well as other similar data), and 
--  notify the USG of any changes in security procedures, 
non-classified checklists, flight plan requirements, and 
training regimen. 
 
5.  (C)  Begin Comment.  As a result of these discussions, it 
is clear that -- other than for information on shootdown 
events -- the USG will have to initiate contacts with the GOB 
when securing information on the shootdown program.  It may 
be worthwhile for USG agencies to: a) establish a checklist 
of information that they would like the AmEmbassy Brasilia 
Air Force Attache to obtain, b) and provide guidance on the 
frequency with which the Attache should seek consultations 
with the GOB.  End Comment. 
 
6.  (C)  PDAS Derham proposed that the two sides ultimately 
document the understanding reached regarding information 
sharing through an exchange of diplomatic notes.  The 
diplomatic notes would expressly reference three attachments: 
 the GOP responses to the first and second set of questions 
from the USG regarding GOB operational procedures and the 
working text that was the subject of this round of 
discussions.  The diplomatic note would also reflect the 
GOB\'s assurances that the shootdown program would only be 
directed at aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily 
engaged in illicit drug trafficking.  The GOB clarified that 
this meant that aircraft carrying drugs or aircraft carrying 
money, weapons, or precursor chemicals to exchange for drugs 
could be subject to lethal force.  (The scope of the GOB\'s 
program thus falls within the scope of the 22 U.S.C. 2291-4, 
i.e., the immunity statute, as further articulated by DOJ in 
the context of the Colombia ABD program.) 
 
7.  (C)  Abreu was open to the idea of an exchange of 
diplomatic notes, though he indicated that he would need to 
check with others (in particular, Minister of Defense Viegas) 
prior to providing us with the GOB,s formal answer.  Both 
sides then explored possible language for inclusion in the 
exchange of diplomatic notes (which would be initiated by the 
GOB).  For Abreu, a red-line was any language which indicated 
that the exchange of diplomatic notes would be a binding 
international agreement, as that would mean that the text 
would need to be approved by the Brazilian congress. 
 
WHA PDAS Derham cleared message.

SUBJECT: LOCKHEED-MARTIN/EMBRAER CONTRACT 
 
1.  (U)  Brazilian newspapers, including a banner August 3 
front page, above-the-fold headline in widely read O Estado 
de Sao Paulo, highlighted the Pentagon\'s selection of 
Lockheed-Martin -- teamed with Embraer and the Harris 
Corporation -- to develop and build the U.S. military\'s next 
generation airborne intelligence, surveillance and 
reconnaissance system, the Ariel Common Sensor (ACS). 
Embraer will provide the airframe based on its successful 
ERJ145/EMB 145 model already widely used around the world and 
build the airframe at a new assembly line at the old USN 
Cecil Field Air Station near Jacksonville, Florida. 
Newspapers here report the total package for the ACS as 
between USD 7 and 10 billion. 
 
2.  (U)  The contract is being trumpeted in Brazilian media 
as a breakthrough achievement for Embraer, the world\'s fourth 
largest aircraft manufacturer.  Embraer is already Brazil\'s 
largest single importer from (aircraft components) and 
exporter to (finished aircraft) the United States.  Even with 
the involvement of Embraer\'s U.S. partners, the contract 
represents Brazil\'s most significant procurement opportunity 
ever with the U.S. military.  It is also viewed as a shot in 
the arm for potential aircraft sales elsewhere. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Comment:  The ACS contract is a victory for 
Brazilian technology and Brazil\'s aerospace industry.  Yet, 
while Embraer and Lockheed-Martin closely collaborated to 
develop the ACS, the two companies remain on opposing sides 
in Brazil\'s next generation jet fighter competition, the F-X 
(Note: Embraer is partnered exclusively with the Dassault 
Mirage bid in the competition.)  A GOB decision on the F-X, 
delayed numerous times since 2002, continues to be in limbo 
due, many observers believe, to the sticker shock of the 
total cost of new high performance fighters.  However, with 
the victory of the Lockheed-Martin/Embraer consortium in the 
ACS competition, Brazil\'s leadership may look with a fresh 
eye at used F-16 offers that are significantly cheaper than 
new fighters.

SUBJECT: LULA IN AFRICA 
 
 
1.  (U) Summary: Brazilian President Lula da Silva visited 
the African countries of Sao Tome and Principe, Gabon, and 
Cape Verde, July 26-29.  The principal rationale for the trip 
was to attend a summit meeting of Portuguese speaking 
countries (Communidades dos Paises de Lingua Portuguesa -- 
CPLP) in Sao Tome and Principe.  Lula also made a stop in 
Libreville, where he shared with Gabonese President Omar 
Bonga a 20 minute ride in a silver Rolls Royce before a 
throng of 3,000 people.  In Cape Verde, the President sought 
to highlight Brazil\'s long-standing social and economic ties 
and assistance programs with the island.  Although Lula 
intended to project Brazil\'s solidarity with Africa, the fact 
that Brazil\'s total annual commerce with the three countries 
visited totals only about USD 30 million perhaps underscores 
the trip\'s marginal significance.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Relations (MRE) Africa Division 
Chief Joao Padilha told poloffs on August 2 that, as current 
head of the CPLP (Brazil had hosted the last summit meeting 
in Brasilia), President Lula had to go to Sao Tome and 
Principe, even though he had already visited the tiny island 
country during a previous Africa trip.  This time, Lula 
brought a senior Petrobras official and promised the 
assistance of Brazilian government energy regulators to 
address GOSTP interest in possible deepwater petroleum 
exploration.  The GOB also donated the equivalent of an 
internet cafe worth of computers; Padilha wryly doubted, 
however, that Brazil had included a power generator in the 
package. 
 
3.  (SBU) Lula,s stop in Gabon had nominally stronger 
political and economic motives.  Lula continued to press 
Brazil\'s long-standing case for UNSC reform -- and a 
permanent Security Council seat for Brazil -- to the country 
that will preside over the next UNGA.  According to Padilha, 
the GOB perceives Gabon as an influential regional player in 
Central/West Africa, particularly as a conflict mediator. 
However, when asked about press reports that cited agreement 
on international trade matters such as the WTO, Padilha 
dismissed the reports, affirming that there was no common 
ground between Brazil and Gabon for serious discussion.  The 
GOB\'s effort to promote investment in Gabon apparently fell 
flat as well.  Reportedly, only 10 businessmen escorted the 
President to Africa -- versus the hundreds who went to China 
in May. The only sector where significant commercial 
collaboration was possible, Padilha believed, is petroleum, 
but Petrobras, he lamented, was entering the oil game late in 
Gabon. 
 
4.  (SBU) In Cape Verde, Lula again announced, with much 
fanfare, that Brazil would provide debt relief -- he had 
promised similar largesse in his earlier stops. (Comment: 
Some Brazilian commentators noted that the debt was 
uncollectible in any case. End comment.)  He also pledged to 
make life easier for Cape Verdians who traveled to Brazil. 
Unfortunately for the President, getting out of Cape Verde 
was more difficult than getting in, as his 47-year old Boeing 
707 (affectionately known as the \'sucatao\', or \'piece of 
junk\') suffered mechanical problems.  An air force plane 
eventually rescued the President. 
 
5.  (SBU) Meanwhile, some Brazilian pundits roundly 
criticized Lula\'s most recent Africa foray, citing the 
irrelevance of the countries visited and ridiculing the 
President for promoting democracy and poverty eradication at 
the CPLP, then taking a Rolls Royce ride with a corrupt 
\"dictator\" in Gabon.  Popular columnist Diogo Mainardi in 
Veja, Brazil\'s version of Time magazine, acidly juxtaposed 
the Gabon spectacle with the President\'s failure to condemn, 
while on African soil, the genocide in Sudan. (Comment: 
Concurrent with Lula\'s trip to Africa, Brazil did support the 
UNSC Darfur resolution. End comment.) 
6.  (SBU)  Comment:  While Lula\'s most recent trip to Africa 
can be deemed neither clearly a success nor a failure, it was 
only marginally significant politically and even less so 
commercially.  The trip could have been an opportunity to 
further Brazil\'s South-South agenda and display Brazil as a 
leader and empathizer for the developing world.  But, Lula\'s 
latest travels may have been an opportunity lost for want of 
a substantive and coherent agenda and the President\'s 
continued penchant for unintentionally leaving in his wake 
inappropriate statements and images.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF PT PARTY SUPPORT FOR CHAVEZ 
 
REF: STATE 168747 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Dennis Hearne. Reasons: 1.4 
(B)(D). 
 
1. (C) Summary, Foreign Ministry (MRE) Andean Division Chief 
Rubem Barbosa disagreed with reftel demarche\'s assertions 
about GOV manipulation and harassment in the run-up to the 15 
August referendum, saying the MRE has received no such 
reports from the OAS observer mission or its embassy.  He 
said the close-call nature of the coming vote seemed to be 
creating a strange calm in which neither side wants to be 
accused of disruptive actions.  Brazil is heavily invested in 
the multilateral effort on the referendum and has ample 
reasons on the national level to fear instability in 
Venezuela, but the GOB is not making contingency plans for 
bilateral engagement in the event of a crisis. In related 
developments, Lula\'s PT Worker\'s Party announced on 5 August 
that the PT will send a delegation to Caracas to support the 
referendum and Chavez, but party president Jose Genoino 
stressed that support for Chavez is a PT position, not GOB 
policy.  End summary. 
 
VIEW FROM THE MRE: \"IT\'S TOO QUIET...\" 
 
2. (C) On 5 August PolCouns demarched Minister Rubem Barbosa, 
Andean Division Chief at the MRE, providing reftel points and 
stressing USG concerns about harassment incidents and GOV 
efforts to manipulate the judiciary in the run-up to the 15 
August referendum. 
 
3. (C) Barbosa said the MRE is in daily contact with the OAS 
observer mission in Venezuela, which is headed by Brazil\'s 
OAS Permrep.  In that context Barbosa disagreed with reftel 
assertions about manipulation and harassment incidents, 
saying the MRE has received no such specific reports.  While 
noting critically Chavez\'s recent \"bombastic remarks\" about 
the USG, Barbosa said the observer mission and Brazil\'s 
embassy in Caracas are reporting a pre-referendum situation 
that is \"quiet, almost too quiet.\"  Elaborating, Barbosa 
explained that the GOB had anticipated more friction, but 
that the \"too close to call\" nature of the coming vote, as 
indicated by polls and experts, seemed to be creating a 
strange calm in which neither side wants to be accused of 
blatant actions that could undercut their standing with 
voters and the international community.  A sudden spike 
indicating advantage for one side or the other could shatter 
the calm, Barbosa added. 
 
4. (C) As chair of the OAS Friends and with one of its senior 
diplomats heading the observer mission, Brazil is invested in 
-- and has its prestige associated with -- multilateral 
efforts to assure a peaceful and transparent referendum, 
Barbosa said.  Moreover, instability in neighboring Venezuela 
obviously would be a grave matter for Brazil across the 
board.  \"For us, the stakes are incredibly high,\" Barbosa 
said, and there is profound concern within the MRE as 15 
August nears.  However, when poloff asked whether the GOB is 
currently gaming out contingency plans for bilateral 
political engagement in the event of an unfolding crisis, or 
considering its options for \"day after\" scenarios, Barbosa 
acknowledged that no such planning is underway.  Barbosa said 
the GOB does plan to send a high-level envoy -- possibly MRE 
Under Secretary for South American Affairs Macedo Soares -- 
to Caracas shortly after the referendum, to underscore to 
\"the winner, whoever it is\" that Brazil wants to work with 
Venezuela to assure a stable way forward. 
 
PT PARTY WILL SEND MISSION TO SUPPORT CHAVEZ 
 
5. (C) Jose Genoino, national president of Lula\'s PT Worker\'s 
Party, announced on 5 August that the PT will send a 
delegation to Caracas for a meeting with Chavez on 11 August, 
as a gesture of the PT\'s support for the referendum process 
and the continuation of Chavez in office. Genoino repeatedly 
stressed that the support for Chavez is a party position, and 
does not reflect the official GOB position of neutrality. 
 
6. (C) Comment. We cannot assess the accuracy of Barbosa\'s 
assertions that international observers are not reporting 
misdeeds, or that there is a fragile calm pervading 
Venezuela.  What we can say is that it is ever clearer that, 
while the GOB has impressively invested influence and 
credibility into the multilateral efforts on Venezuela, it 
does not currently appear prepared to take a meaningful 
bilateral role if there is an unfolding crisis after 15 
August.  On the national policy level, it appears to us that 
the GOB leadership has resolved to quietly cross its fingers 
and wait, perhaps expecting a Chavez win and hoping for some 
form of uneasy peace in the aftermath.  But hope is not a 
strategy, and it is worrying that the GOB apparently is not 
prepared for decisive engagement if there is a 
post-referendum meltdown, despite the political, economic and 
security issues at stake for Brazil.  The PT\'s wandering off 
to Caracas to embrace Chavez at this sensitive juncture, 
despite strenuous GOB efforts over the past several months to 
maintain a posture of objectivity, could further raise 
anxiety levels within the MRE and presidency as the GOB looks 
ahead to 15 August.  We will continue to engage with the MRE 
on Venezuela over the next several days, and will seek an 
appointment asap with Under Secretary for South American 
Affairs Macedo Soares.

Classified by Economic Counselor Roman Wasilewski, Reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  A new charge of financial misconduct 
against Central Bank President Meirelles contributed to 
market unease on Thursday August 5, unlike previous 
allegations that he failed to properly disclose his finances 
(ref A).  The new allegation involves a $50,000 payment by 
Meirelles in October 2002, before he became Central Bank 
Chairman, to an account allegedly associated with black 
market currency traders exposed in the Banestado case (refs 
B-D).  As with the previous allegations, Meirelles has fought 
back quickly and publicly, stating in multiple interviews and 
press appearances since yesterday that the payment was an 
innocent one made for the renovation of his New York 
apartment.  Meirelles has stated that he will not contemplate 
stepping down, and President Lula reportedly has said that he 
will not ask Meirelles to do so.  The reassurances appear to 
have calmed financial markets, which by mid-day Friday were 
recovering nicely.  We do not believe that the current 
charges will end in Meirelles\' departure.  Even if fresh 
revelations were ultimately to do so, given Lula\'s personal 
commitment to an orthodox economic policy agenda, we do not 
doubt that he would replace Meirelles with someone 
like-minded.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Veja Magazine published on Thursday August 5 charges 
that Meirelles had paid $50,000 into an offshore account 
associated with a well known black market currency trader and 
failed to report the existence of the account from which the 
payment was made on his 2002 tax return.  This followed on 
the heels of allegations each of the last two weeks about 
income-tax improprieties prior to 2003 (ref A).  Unlike the 
previous instances, the latest accusation affected financial 
markets, by traders\' accounts, exacerbating worries over 
record high oil prices.  The Sao Paulo stock exchange 
(BOVESPA) fell 3.82% on the day, the Real depreciated 0.5% 
and Brazil\'s country risk rose 3%, closing at 615. 
 
3. (U) Meirelles once again fought back quickly, granting 
several interviews, issuing a Central Bank press release and 
appearing on the August 6 \"Good Morning Brazil\" to refute the 
charge.  In denying any wrong-doing, Meirelles claimed that 
he had no personal connection with the currency trader and 
had simply paid a $50,000 bill owed to a third party in 
connection with the renovation of his New York apartment by 
transferring money to the (ultimately suspect) account named 
by that party.  Regarding the second part of the charge, that 
he had failed to declare on his 2002 tax return the account 
from which the payment was made, Meirelles stated there was 
no such obligation because the account was closed before the 
end of 2002. 
 
4. (U) The accusation sparked renewed opposition calls for 
Meirelles to step down, a step that Meirelles reiterated he 
is not contemplating.  While not speaking out publicly, Lula 
is reported widely to have told confidants that he will not 
ask Meirelles to go and as being satisfied with Meirelles\' 
explanations of the transactions.  The reassurances appear to 
have calmed local financial markets, which by mid-day Friday 
had recovered almost half of Thursday\'s lost ground. 
 
5. (C) The opposition PFL and PSDB parties are planning to 
make political hay out of the issue (despite the fact that 
Meirelles himself is a PSDB member who gave up his seat in 
the Federal Chamber of Deputies to take over at the Central 
Bank).  PSDB Senator Antero Paes de Barros, who chairs the 
Senate\'s long-running inquiry into the Banestado money 
laundering scandal is believed by some to have leaked the 
information on Meirelles\' bank accounts from the archives he 
has collected for the Banestado case.  If so, this would not 
be the first time Paes de Barros has been suspected of 
politicized, anonymous leaks, having played a part in the 
emergence of the famous Waldomiro/Charlie Waterfall 
videotapes. 
 
6. (SBU) There is some maneuvering now over whether Meirelles 
will be called before the Senate\'s Economic Affairs or 
Oversight Committee, but in the end the two committees may 
meet in joint session to question him.  The opposition 
parties could seek to drag out the affair for weeks to avoid 
taking action on legislation that President Lula would like 
to see pass in the abbreviated Congressional sessions before 
the October municipal elections.  Questioning Meirelles about 
alleged corruption would provide a headline-making 
alternative for an opposition that does not want to hand Lula 
any political victories that could help Workers\' Party (PT) 
candidates in the elections. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  Meirelles\' open discussion of the 
allegations with the press stands in marked contrast to Lula 
Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu\'s closed-mouth reaction to the 
Waldomiro Diniz scandal of early this year.  Barring 
extensive new revelations, we continue to believe that GoB 
damage control efforts in this case and the relatively minor 
nature of the charges make it unlikely that Meirelles will be 
forced to leave.  Moreover, the fact that a replacement would 
require Congressional confirmation gives Lula and the GoB 
even more incentive to defend Meirelles, since obtaining such 
confirmation ahead of the October municipal elections would 
be difficult and give disaffected congressmen a target at 
which to aim their discontent with interest rate policy, the 
GoB\'s avowed intent to seek Central Bank autonomy in 2005, 
and the broader GoB economic policy agenda.  Even in the 
unlikely event that fresh future revelations do force 
Meirelles out, we have no doubt that Lula will choose a 
replacement from Brazil\'s ample field of qualified candidates 
who is equally dedicated to the orthodox policies that have 
marked Meirelles\' tenure.  The GoB\'s commitment to orthodox 
economic policy does not hinge on Meirelles, but rather on 
Lula himself.

SUBJECT: ONE LESS ROGUE IN THE GALLERY: POLITICIAN CHARGED 
WITH MURDER IS EXPELLED FROM BRASILIA\'S LEGISLATURE 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Carlos Xavier on August 10 became the 
first legislator ever expelled from the District Assembly 
(equivalent to a state senate) of the Federal District of 
Brasilia.  No mean feat, given the Assembly\'s notoriety as a 
haven for scoundrels.  Xavier, who emerged from humble 
origins, is the subject of an ongoing investigation into a 
web of land frauds.  But the crime that led to his expulsion 
was his alleged involvement in the murder of a 16-year old 
boy who had been having an affair with Xavier\'s wife.  While 
the evidence against Xavier was overwhelming and his defense 
implausible, his Assembly colleagues expelled him by the 
bare-minimum vote margin.  Some of the other Deputies were 
probably concerned about setting a precedent by expelling an 
accused criminal, as the 24-member Assembly --never known for 
its high-quality work-- still houses a half dozen Deputies 
suspected of various crimes.  Thus, the entire affair leaves 
in doubt whether this is a blow against impunity, a small 
step in the right direction, or merely serves to draw a line: 
 that murderers, at least, will not be tolerated in the 
District Assembly.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BOOTBLACK AND BOOTSTRAPS 
------------------------ 
2. (SBU) One of eleven children of an itinerant bricklayer, 
Carlos Xavier put himself through school shining shoes and 
selling candy on street corners.  Finding work as a 
bureaucrat in the Brasilia government, he got involved in 
local politics and in 1994 was elected to the first of three 
terms in the District Assembly.  A member of the PMDB party 
and allied to PMDB Governor Joaquim Roriz, Xavier beat 
charges in 1998 that he bribed two teenaged girls not to 
testify against his brother in a rape case.  Since 2001, he 
has been under investigation on charges that he and his 
cronies benefited from his actions to fraudulently rezone 
empty public lots as business sites.  Some of the properties\' 
values increased fifty times. 
 
3. (SBU) In 2002, Carlos Xavier ran for his third term in the 
Brasilia District Assembly.  During the race, campaign 
volunteer Ewerton da Rocha began a sexual affair with 
Xavier\'s wife.  In March 2004, Ewerton, 16, was found shot to 
death in a field --allegedly killed by two youths sent by 
Xavier.  Xavier had visited Ewerton\'s house just before the 
killing and threatened his parents.  The police and the 
District Assembly\'s Ethics Committee began looking into his 
involvement in the murder, and on June 22, a Brasilia court 
indicted him for aggravated homicide.  A week later, the 
Ethics Committee passed a motion for Xavier\'s expulsion. 
 
CARLOS XAVIER NARROWLY EXPELLED FROM ASSEMBLY 
--------------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Given a chance to present a defense, Xavier\'s weepy 
ramblings convinced nobody, and on August 5, the full 
24-member Assembly cast the bare minimum 13 votes to expel 
him.  No appeal is possible.  Thus Xavier became the first 
District Deputy to be expelled from the Assembly in its 
thirteen-year history.  Afterward, some of his PMDB 
colleagues tried vainly to annul the vote, but the expulsion 
became official on August 10.  In addition to losing his 
Assembly seat, Xavier loses his \"political rights\" and cannot 
run in any election until 2014.  He will be tried for murder 
in a common court along with his co-defendants. 
 
\"CRICKETING\" - BRASILIA\'S OLDEST PROFESSION 
------------------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) \"Cricketing\" (\"grilagem\") is a term that covers a 
range of land crimes from fraudulent zoning to outright land 
theft.  It came by its name because early perpetrators would 
put forged deeds into a box with live crickets, whose 
effluence would yellow the documents and lend them 
authenticity.  Cricketing is particularly common in Brasilia 
because the city has sprung up in forty years on near-empty 
land in Brazil\'s interior.  Brasilia\'s real estate and 
development agencies, Terracap and Novacap, administer 
340,000 hectares of public land, privatizing and zoning it as 
necessary.  For decades clever bureaucrats, politicians, and 
builders have found ingenious ways to manipulate the titling 
and zoning processes for immense personal gain.  With their 
enormous profits and low risk, land frauds are at the heart 
of most of Brasilia\'s scandals and are the basis for the 
personal fortunes of many local politicians. 
 
ASSEMBLY NO STRANGER TO CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS 
-------------------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Thus the Xavier affair no doubt causes some jitters 
among those who would rather not set a precedent of expelling 
accused criminals.  Or as one of Xavier\'s allies told the 
press, \"If you open the gate, the whole herd might get out.\" 
Among the suspects: 
 
- Benicio Tavares (PMDB), the Assembly Speaker, who uses a 
wheelchair, has built a career as a defender of handicapped 
rights.  Last year he was convicted of embezzling funds from 
the Handicapped Association of Brasilia, of which he was 
President. 
 
- Wigberto Tartuce (PP). The \"Big Vig\" resigned as Brasilia\'s 
Labor Secretary in 1999 under fire for embezzling millions 
from unemployment programs and laundering it through offshore 
accounts linked to the \"Banestado\" scandal.  His tenure at 
the Secretariat has so far resulted in 42 investigations, and 
Tartuce has been ordered to repay over US$ 1.5 million.  In 
June, a judge ordered him to pay back a US$ 370,000 gambling 
debt he ran up in four days in a Bahamian casino. 
 
- Jose Edmar (PMDB), jailed for a month in 2003 during a land 
fraud investigation called \"Operation Cricket\".  Edmar, who 
now fortuitously chairs the Assembly\'s Land Affairs 
Committee, has threatened to kill Tartuce, whose backroom 
maneuvers he blames for landing him in jail. 
 
- Pedro Passos (PMDB), chairs the Justice Committee.  A crony 
of Governor Roriz, together and separately they have been 
subjects of many land fraud allegations.  In 1995, an 
Assembly investigation called him Brasilia\'s \"greatest land 
predator\".  In 2002, he was convicted of land fraud in a case 
that is now on appeal.  A 2003 case for stealing land in 
public parks has yet to come to trial. 
 
- Junior Brunelli (PP), started his cricketing career as an 
evangelical church leader selling plots of land in heaven. 
In April, he was in line to fill the urgent vacancy as Chair 
of the Ethics Committee, which was then in the middle of the 
Xavier case, until it emerged that he was under investigation 
on suspicion that, during the 2002 campaign, he set up an 
amateurish gang that intimidated opponents and murdered a 
man.  In early 2004, Brunelli was allegedly behind the 
murders of two of the gang members to silence them.  The 
police investigation continues, but the District Assembly 
thought it prudent not to make Brunelli the Ethics Committee 
Chairman. 
 
- Odilon Aires and Gim Argello (PMDB).  Odilon was caught on 
tape in 2002 complaining that his bribe for processing a huge 
block of fraudulent land titles was only 50 lots, whereas Gim 
Argello (now the Vice-Speaker) received 200.  The Assembly\'s 
Ethics Committee buried the case. 
 
- Luiz Estevao (PMDB), no longer in the Assembly because he 
was elected to the federal Senate in 2000, and then expelled 
the next year when his construction firm was caught engaging 
in massive overcharging and contract fixing on the 1999 
construction of a Sao Paulo courthouse. 
 
- Jose Tatico (PTB), elected Federal Deputy after serving 
three terms in the District Assembly.  Caught using Assembly 
funds to pay employees at a supermarket he owns, he was given 
an ethics warning. 
 
7. (SBU) No Brasilia politician has ever been seriously 
punished for corruption and many are reelected even after 
their misdeeds become public.  Some, like Estevao, Tatico, 
and Jose Roberto Arruda (a Federal Deputy who in 2002 won the 
most votes in Brasilia\'s history a year after he resigned 
from the Senate in a scandal), even make it to the federal 
Congress.  Ruminating on Carlos Xavier\'s expulsion, Federal 
Deputy Maninha (PT-Brasilia) doubts that there will be a 
domino effect of other expulsions because the Deputies have 
the goods on each other.  \"There won\'t be a second Carlos 
Xavier in the short-term\", she says, \"these Deputies are 
living archives, and now they\'ll be shut tight.  Morality 
will only come with popular pressure.\" 
 
 
COMMENT - DISTRICT ASSEMBLY CAN\'T GET ANY WORSE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
8. (SBU) Brasilia\'s District Assembly has never been known 
for the high quality of its work.  In the first three months 
of 2004 alone, Governor Roriz vetoed 40 of the Assembly\'s 
bills  because they were unconstitutional on their face. 
After long debate, the Assembly in February passed one bill 
to create a fishing pond for the unemployed to catch their 
dinners and another that would build public bathrooms 
exclusively for gays (both were vetoed).  The Assembly spent 
months choosing a wolf as Brasilia\'s official animal after 
the first choice, a type of fish, was black-listed when it 
was discovered to be a hermaphroditic species.  Workers\' 
Party (PT) freshman Deputy Erika Kokay has lost her taste for 
the legislature, saying she will not run for reelection in 
2006, \"I have no intention of staying here.  This place is a 
non-entity.\" 
 
9. (SBU) Given the gravity of the charges against him, it is 
encouraging that Carlos Xavier was expelled.  But it seems 
unlikely that the case is the tip of the iceberg in terms of 
cleaning up the District Assembly.  His colleagues voted him 
out by the narrowest majority and Brasilia\'s voters have 
remarkably short memories where corruption is concerned.  It 
is not at all clear whether the Xavier affair is a resounding 
blow against impunity for Brazilian politicians, a small step 
in the right direction, or merely serves to draw a tremulous 
red line:  that murderers, at least, will not be tolerated in 
Brasilia\'s legislature.

SUBJECT: GSP: FIRST US-BRAZIL IPR WORKING GROUP MEETING 
 
Classified By: Economic Officer Janice Fair for reasons 1.4, (b) and (d 
) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  As a result of the 90-day extension 
announced on June 30, 2004 for review of Brazil\'s trade 
benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a 
bilateral IPR Working Group held its inaugural session on 
August 5 in Rio de Janeiro to discuss IPR enforcement issues. 
 The WG was formed as part of the existing U.S.-Brazil 
Bilateral Consultative Mechanism (BCM) with the aim of 
identifying concrete steps the GoB is undertaking to improve 
enforcement of copyright laws and combat piracy.  Not 
unexpectedly, the GoB offered no concrete commitments on new 
actions during this initial meeting.  However, despite some 
push-back, the atmospherics for the meeting were generally 
positive and the tone of the discussion was constructive. 
The next WG session will take place in Washington DC the week 
of September 6 and will focus on producing a report, which 
will be presented later in the month to DUSTR Peter Allgeier 
and to U/S Clodoaldo Hugueney, as joint chairs of the BCM 
process.  The U.S. GSP Committee will review the WG\'s report 
as it considers further action regarding the International 
Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) petition to remove 
Brazil\'s GSP benefits.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Within the United States-Brazil Bilateral Consultative 
Mechanism process, U.S. and Brazilian officials launched a 
bilateral Working Group on IPR enforcement during a five-hour 
session in Rio de Janeiro on August 5, 2004.  The Brazilian 
delegation was led by Foreign Ministry rep Antonino Marques 
Porto e Santos, Chief of the Department for Scientific and 
Technological Affairs, who reports directly to MRE\'s 
Undersecretary for Economic and Technological Affairs, 
Ambassador Hugueney.  Porto was accompanied by Otavio 
Brandelli and Henrique Choer Moraes - Acting Chief and 
Advisor in MRE\'s Intellectual Property Division, 
respectively; Ambassador Oswaldo Portella - International 
Advisor, Valquiria Souza Teixera de Andrade - Director 
General of the Federal Police, and Robson Robin da Silva 
-Advisor to the National Secretariat for Public Security from 
the Ministry of Justice; and Ernani Checcucci - Acting 
Director General of Customs in the Ministry of Finance. 
 
3. (U) Sue Cronin, USTR Senior Director for Brazil and the 
Southern Cone led the U.S. delegation, which included Linda 
Lourie, Attorney-Advisor, USPTO Office of International 
Relations; David Edwards, State Brazil desk officer; Erin 
McConaha, Consulate Rio Econoff; and Janice Fair, Embassy 
Brasilia Econoff.  USG participants for the afternoon session 
via teleconference were Brian Peck, Senior Director of 
Intellectual Property, USTR; Leslie Yang, Director for 
MERCOSUR, USTR; Caridad Berdut, Attorney-Advisor, USPTO 
Office of Enforcement; Mary Rasenberger, Policy Planning 
Advisor, U.S.  Copyright Office; Jennifer Boger, 
International Trade Specialist, Commerce Department; and Meg 
Ward, Brazil desk officer, Commerce Department. 
 
4. (SBU) The WG on IPR enforcement was formed as a result of 
discussions between DUSTR Peter Allgeier and Brazilian 
Ambassador to the U.S., Roberto Abdenur, following USTR\'s 
announcement on June 30, 2004 that the USG\'s review of 
Brazil\'s continuing benefits under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) trade program had been extended by 90 days 
(until September 30).  The review was prompted by a petition 
submitted in 2001 in which the IIPA requested that GSP 
benefits for Brazilian products be removed on grounds the 
Brazilian government does not provide adequate copyright 
protection.  While providing a bilateral forum for discussion 
of IPR enforcement issues in general, the WG has as a 
specific objective the development of a report on the GoB\'s 
recent actions and work plan for improving the enforcement of 
copyright protection and combating piracy.  This information 
will feed into GSP Committee deliberations as it decides 
what action to take regarding the IIPA petition. 
 
5. (C) Not surprisingly, no GoB commitments emerged from this 
initial meeting.  However, despite a pro-forma reiteration of 
the Brazilian view that it is inappropriate to address IPR 
enforcement under the GSP program, the tone of the meeting 
was generally constructive, with Brazilian interlocutors 
professing a sincere interest in resolving the GSP/IPR issue. 
 
 
6. (C) In his opening remarks, Minister Porto cautioned 
against misrepresentations that imply the GoB has done little 
in (\"lacks\") IPR enforcement.  He emphasized that the WG 
should work constructively to avoid negative repercussions in 
the otherwise broad and rich bilateral relationship.  To 
deflect the focus from being solely on GoB actions, Porto was 
also keen throughout the meeting to frame the discussion as a 
bilateral exchange and to emphasize that effective IPR 
enforcement cannot be attained by Brazil alone, but requires 
international cooperation. 
 
7. (C) To ensure the Brazilian interlocutors understood the 
seriousness of the situation, Cronin drew attention to the 
real risk posed by the GSP review by noting the past 
withdrawal of GSP benefits from Argentina and Honduras on IPR 
grounds.   Cronin stressed the USG preference to avoid such 
an outcome through a productive WG process.  Cronin also took 
pains to make clear that although the WG is a bilateral 
forum, the WG is charged with producing a report that 
identifies GoB, not USG, actions to improve copyright 
enforcement; the issue is piracy of U.S. products in the 
Brazilian market, not piracy of Brazilian products in the 
U.S. market. 
 
8. (C) Regarding possible GoB actions, Porto stressed that 
the WG process itself is important and that Brazil won\'t 
accept guidelines imposed from abroad.  Porto and his team 
said the Brazilian executive branch is analyzing the 
recommendations contained in the June 23 report of the 
Chamber of Deputies\' Parliamentary Investigative Commission 
(CPI) on Piracy and Tax Evasion, but it was not yet possible 
to identify those measures that will be implemented.  They 
stressed the complexity of certain recommendations, 
particularly those involving different branches of the 
government, and cautioned that the CPI report is not a cake 
recipe in which once the recommendations are implemented 
piracy is eliminated.  Cronin suggested the CPI 
recommendations be viewed more as a menu offering good 
suggestions on meaningful actions the GoB can undertake to 
combat piracy. 
 
9. (C) Minister Porto and his delegation gave extensive 
reports on current GoB enforcement efforts including those of 
the Federal Police, Customs, and of the Secretariat of Public 
Security.  Some of the more interesting points included: 
- Admission that the Inter-ministerial Committee on Piracy 
had not performed adequately and an indication the GoB is 
looking at its reformulation, including possible inclusion of 
private-sector representatives and a more direct role with 
law enforcement activities. 
- Existence of Mercosul Agreement #5 in 2003 to enhance 
regional security by strengthening intelligence exchange on 
piracy activities and GoB plans to press for increased joint 
action in the Southern Cone during Brazil\'s tenure as 
Mercosul president pro tempore.  Specifically, copyright 
violation will be a central topic of Interior Ministers 
(Mercosul plus Associate members) during a meeting this 
semester. 
- Existence of a Unified Public Security System (Ministry of 
Justice) for integrating and standardizing crime information 
as a means of improving public security (covers all types of 
crime). 
- With regard to a CPI recommendation for increasing 
copyright infringement penalties, Porto noted that changes to 
Brazil\'s penal code in 2003 already increased the minimum 
sentence from one to two years (Note: the increase in 
penalties does not apply to software piracy). 
- Seemingly high level of coordination with other government 
agencies by Brazil\'s Customs to combat smuggling at ports, 
airports, and along the frontier.  Customs uses an integrated 
system of a trade database and intelligence information to 
determine inspections based on risk factor.  To deter 
transshipment of pirated products or their base materials, 
Customs inspects all shipments of \"sensitive\" products - 
included virgin CDs since 2000; list was expanded this year 
to now include all shipments of CDs.  Customs is also 
considering banning the transshipment of CDs and blank 
CD-ROMs (presumably to Paraguay). 
 
10. (SBU) U.S. officials on conference call from Washington 
provided an overview of U.S. procedures to combat piracy, in 
particular, U.S. Customs\' ability as a competent authority to 
determine infringement and dispose of merchandise without 
judicial action. 
 
11. (C) In speaking with Porto after the formal close of the 
meeting, Cronin emphasized the need for the WG to show real 
results, and explained that the WG report will be considered 
by the GSP Committee in making its final decision on the 
90-day GSP review.  Cronin also noted that the role of the 
judicial system had not been discussed and encouraged the GoB 
to consider possible action in this area to further deter 
piracy. 
 
12. (C) The next WG meeting will take place in Washington DC. 
the week of September 6, specific date to be determined, and 
will focus on producing a report.  Working Group officials 
will present their report later in September to DUSTR Peter 
Allgeier and to the Foreign Ministry\'s Under Secretary for 
Economic and Technological Affairs, Clodoaldo Hugueney, joint 
chairs of the BCM, at a venue to be determined. 
 
Comment 
 
13.  (C) Considering the GoB\'s normal sensitivity regarding 
IPR issues, the frank and serious exchange of this meeting is 
noteworthy.  While Porto displayed some prickliness out of 
concern that the shorthand reference to \"Brazil\'s lack of 
enforcement\" evokes the misperception that Brazil in no way 
provides IPR protection, he refrained from using \"lack of 
resources\" and legalistic arguments (recent WTO case on EU\'s 
GSP program) to avoid entirely a discussion of the GSP/IPR 
enforcement problem.  This in part may reflect the less 
antagonistic attitude of Ambassador Hugueney, with whom USTR 
works closely on WTO issues, compared to those of his other 
MRE counterparts.  The timing may also be propitious, as the 
fanfare surrounding the CPI report already creates pressure 
within Brazil to improve IPR protection, so that subsequent 
GoB enactment of new measures need not be linked to USG 
pressure.  These next weeks may clarify GoB intentions as the 
CPI formally wraps up on August 11.  The GoB will likely give 
serious and careful consideration to CPI recommendations in 
an effort to calibrate its response to the USG, searching for 
sufficient action to avoid losing GSP benefits. It is 
impossible to know at this juncture if the GoB is prepared to 
do what is necessary.  The devil will be in the details when 
the WG next meets and the discussion turns to the specifics 
of the report.

SUBJECT: IMF RESREP ON INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING INITIATIVE 
 
REF: BRASILIA 291 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Roman Wasilewski, Reasons 1.4 (b) and 
 (d). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  An IMF mission visited Brazil the last two 
weeks of July to discuss a pilot project effort at how the 
IMF accounts for investment.  The pilot project grew out of 
an initiative by President Lula, advocated in letters to the 
G-7 heads of state, to increase the space for investment 
within the budgets of countries on IMF programs.  IMF Resrep 
Max Alier (please protect) says the trickiest part of the 
issue is project selection.  It appears the GoB hopes for 
some IMF political cover as it seeks to build consensus to 
change the expenditure/investment mix within its fiscal 
constraints.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The GoB initiative was launched by Lula in early 2004, 
at a time when the GoB was under considerable criticism for 
having frozen investment spending budgeted by the Congress, 
in order to meet the primary surplus target (reftel).  This 
coincided with pressure from Argentina for the GoB to support 
its defiant stance towards the IMF.  Argentina\'s Kirchner 
argued that the GoA could not both meet the needs of its 
populace, meet its IMF budget targets and pay off its 
creditors.  Lula\'s response sought, in a set of letters to 
the G-7 heads of state, support for an initiative to IMF for 
a change in how investment was accounted for in terms of 
primary surplus targets. 
 
3. (C) Alier told Emboff that the easiest way to conceive of 
how the GoB\'s accounting proposal works is by comparison to 
the primary surplus target adjustor that was built into 
Brazil\'s current IMF program, which expires at the end of the 
year.  The GoB was allowed to invest in a series of 
sanitation projects, in the amount that it had over-performed 
its primary surplus target in the previous year.  The primary 
surplus target was adjusted downward by this amount. 
Likewise, in the pilot project case, the primary surplus 
target would adjust to account for investment on one of these 
agreed projects.  It is not clear to post that in this pilot 
project case, as was the case with the sanitation projects, 
that there would be any requirement to have over-performed 
the target in previous periods. 
 
4. (C) A sometimes bemused Alier pointed out that the GoB\'s 
IMF progam expired at the end of the year and there was no 
expectation that the GoB would seek a new one.  That meant 
that the GoB could do as it wants with its budget next year, 
he pointed out.  Neither had the GoB invoked its right to use 
the adjustor in the current program.  Quite the contrary, it 
was significantly over-performing the primary surplus target, 
with the de-cascading and rate increase of the PIS/COFINS tax 
that formed part of last year\'s tax reform increasing 
revenues by 1% of GDP. 
 
5. (C) In a separate conversation, Finance Ministry International Secretary Luis Pereira told Emboff that the GoB ultimate goal is to use the exercise to \"build political consensus to change the current expenditure/investment mix.\" Alier seconded this point, saying he had been told that the GoB wants to increase investment but needs a bit of incentive to \"to it right.\" 
 
6. (C) Alier emphasized that the investment accounting exercise only makes sense if you can find public investment projects with a positive rate of return.  He said the Fund 
could usefully help the GoB re-build its project-evaluation 
capacity, which has eroded.  This would have the happy 
knock-on effect of helping the GoB capacity to evaluate 
projects proposed under the prospective Public-Private-Partnerships law, which is still pending in Congress. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  It appears that the Finance Ministry, and 
maybe the GoB more broadly, hope to use the Fund pilot 
project for political cover as it works to change the 
expenditure/investment mix within existing financial 
constraints.  Maintaining some level of IMF involvement 
through this pilot project would also help the GoB reassure 
the markets that it will remain fiscally responsible even as 
it looks to increase investment spending.

SUBJECT: LULA\'S POPULARITY TICKS UPWARD ON ECONOMIC OPTIMISM 
 
REF: SAO PAULO 1138 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  A CNT/Sensus poll released August 10 in Brazil 
shows that President Lula da Silva\'s approval ratings have 
ticked upwards to 58%, after slipping steadily since he took 
office.  Similarly, the GoB\'s approvals, which tend to run 
lower than Lula\'s personal numbers, also showed signs of 
recovery, jumping to 38%.  The uptick seems to be based on 
incipient signs of an economic recovery and an improved 
political climate.  If the trend continues in the coming 
months, it could strengthen Lula\'s legislative hand in 
Congress and improve the prospects for Workers\' Party (PT) 
candidates in October\'s nationwide municipal elections.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  A CNT/Sensus poll released in Brazil on August 10 shows 
that President Lula\'s personal approval ratings improved by 
four points, to 58%, since June.  Still substantially lower 
than the 84% approval he enjoyed when he took office in 
January 2003, the increase suggests that Lula is recovering 
from his administration\'s nadir in early 2004.  Similarly, 
the GoB\'s approvals improved by nine points to 38%. 
 
APPROVAL RATINGS - CNT/SENSUS POLLING 
 
      1/03     8/03     2/04     6/04     8/04

GoB    57%      48%      40%      29%      38% 
 
 
3.  The nadir of this administration began in February 2004 
with the \"Waldomiro scandal\", which weakened the government 
and led to a series of well-publicized defeats in Congress 
and acrimonious debate over the minimum wage that continued 
through June.  At the same time, the economy --and 
particularly employment figures-- were stubbornly sluggish 
despite a year of fiscal austerity.  But over the past 
several weeks the economic news has begun to improve with 
strengthening wage and employment figures.  The poll revealed 
that respondents\' satisfaction with health and education has 
also ticked up since June, and 46% of respondents believe the 
economy\'s performance will improve their quality of life. 
 
4.  Paralleling Lula\'s improvement, Marta Suplicy, the 
Workers\' Party (PT) incumbent running a tough campaign to 
keep her seat as Sao Paulo\'s Mayor, also saw her numbers 
strengthen, according to Datafolha polling (reftel).  Marta 
was trailing challenger Jose Serra (PSDB) by fifteen points 
in May but has taken the lead by 30%-25%, with Paulo Maluf 
dropping to 19%.  However, if no candidate wins a majority in 
the October 3 voting, a second round will be held on October 
31, and Serra still leads Marta in second-round projections 
by 52-38%.  Nationwide, the PT is running competitively in 
the mayoral races in at least 12 of the 26 state capitals. 
 
5.  COMMENT.  Lula and the GoB are surely breathing a sigh of 
relief that they seem to have emerged from the slump of early 
2004.  This trend may be a based on a combination of factors: 
 the economy\'s finally responding to eighteen months of 
fiscal austerity, the government\'s regaining its traction 
after the Waldomiro scandal, or --as some pundits suggest-- 
now that Lula\'s honeymoon has ended, the public has reduced 
its unrealistically high expectations for his administration. 
 Of course, this confidence is worth little unless it carries 
some political agency.  The true test of Lula\'s recovery is 
whether it translates into victories in the October municipal 
elections and whether it strengthens the administration\'s 
hand when Congress gets back to business in November.

1.  Marcus Vinicius da Costa of the Ministry of Foreign

considering signing the Capetown Convention on Aircraft 
Financing.  In response to lobbying by Brazilian aircraft 
manufacturer Embraer, which strongly favors GoB adherence to 
the treaty, the MFA formally has requested comments from the 
Ministry of Finance, Central Bank and other interested 
industry parties.  The GoB bureaucratic process is still at 
a preliminary stage, he said, and obtaining an opinion on 
the convention from the Ministry of Finance legal department 
would be the next key step.  Noting that U/S Larson had 
urged Finance Ministry Executive Secretary Appy and 
International Secretary Pereira to consider adhering to the 
convention during his July 21 visit (reftel), Emboff 
encouraged da Costa not to allow the GoB\'s deliberations to 
lose momentum.

PROPOSED JOURNALISM RULES

1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Lula administration last week proposed 
a journalism law that created a stir in the Brazilian press. 
The Journalism Council bill would create a national oversight 
body with authorities to regulate and discipline the press. 
It created such controversy --including charges of 
\"Stalinism\" from some overwrought editorialists-- that 
congressional leaders quickly pushed it to the back burner. 
The bill may be the fruit of some residual statist tendencies 
in the Workers\' Party (PT), but it also reflects a GoB 
frustration with sensationalism and inaccuracies in the 
press.  It is probably not coincidental that it was announced 
in the middle of two controversies involving questionable 
journalistic ethics:  the Banestado money-laundering scandal 
and a journalist\'s confession that a 1993 story that led to 
the expulsion of a Federal Deputy contained errors.  Lula\'s 
advisors may give the journalism bill token support, but it 
seems unlikely to come to a vote in Congress this year, if 
ever.  A second controversial measure, an audiovisual bill to 
regulate film and TV, is still being drafted and has not been 
sent to Congress.  END SUMMARY. 
 
JOURNALISM BILL SENT TO CONGRESS 
-------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) Since 1967 and the dictatorship era, Brazil\'s Labor 
Ministry has been nominally responsible for overseeing the 
profession of journalism but has done nothing more than 
maintain a registry of professional journalists.  The 
National Journalists Federation (FENAJ) claims to represent 
30,000 journalists from 31 unions but does not provide 
oversight.  (FENAJ is loosely associated with President 
Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) and most of its directors are PT 
members.)  The Lula administration saw a gap in this 
structure: a lack of legal authority to oversee and regulate 
the field.  So, with FENAJ\'s input, the Labor Ministry 
drafted a bill to create a Federal Journalism Council (CFJ) 
and five subordinate Regional Councils (CRJs).  Lula sent the 
bill to Congress on August 6, and as soon as the text became 
public it sparked controversy.  Under the bill\'s rules, 
journalists would have to register and pay dues to the 
councils and would elect the councils\' members.  The councils 
would create and enforce an ethics code, oversee the 
profession, and discipline journalists.  Lula\'s Press 
Secretary, Ricardo Kotscho, noted that the bill is 
 
SIPDIS 
\"negotiable\" and was designed to \"open the debate\".  FENAJ 
announced that \"the CFJ is an essential instrument for the 
profession\" and would \"protect journalists from manipulation\" 
by private interests. 
 
MANY JOURNALISTS ARE RESOLUTELY OPPOSED 
--------------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) Journalists were quick to react.  The Brazilian 
Press Association (ABI) and the major newspapers railed 
against the bill.  An editorial in conservative \"Estado de 
Sao Paulo\" called it an \"authoritarian offensive\" and noted 
that the GoB is \"showing its dictatorial face\".  Popular TV 
newscaster Boris Casoy called the bill \"abominable\" and an 
\"obvious attempt to control journalists and the press\".  The 
international press picked up comments in \"Folha de Sao 
Paulo\" that the bill is \"authoritarian\" and \"Stalinist\" and 
recalled last May\'s episode when President Lula threatened to 
expel a New York Times reporter for an unflattering article. 
The circle of critics eventually expanded to include leading 
political and intellectual figures within the PT party and 
across the ideological spectrum. 
 
CONGRESS WILL MOVE VERY SLOWLY 
------------------------------ 
4. (SBU) The bill is now in the Chamber of Deputies, where it 
faces a slow march through three committees before going to 
the floor.  In the unlikely event it passes the Chamber, it 
would face a similar trek through the Senate.  The PT 
Chairman of the Chamber\'s Labor Committee said he favored the 
creation of the Journalism Council if it is done in a 
\"democratic spirit\", adding that national councils already 
exist for lawyers and doctors.  But Chamber Speaker Joao 
Paulo Cunha announced that he will allow a \"full debate\", 
i.e., the bill will move very slowly.  Cunha noted that the 
administration could have saved itself the trouble, since a 
similar bill, sponsored by Deputy Celso Russomanno (PP-SP), 
has been pending in the Chamber since 2002. 
 
5. (SBU) The opposition PSDB and PFL parties immediately 
pounced.  Jose Carlos Aleluia, the PFL\'s floor leader, could 
be seen in Congress last week toting a book with Hitler\'s 
face on the cover.  He told the press, \"I hope that President 
Lula is not taking the same path as Stalin and Hitler.  The 
bill is a clear demonstration of the authoritarian roots of 
the government.  The press should oversee the government, and 
not vice versa.\"  Aleluia promises to use parliamentary 
tactics to block the bill.  Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo 
Alckmin (PSDB) added, \"Sometimes this government has an 
authoritarian relapse.\" 
 
GOB\'S LATENT STATIST TENDENCIES 
------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) The administration did not help its own cause when 
Lula\'s Communications Secretary Luiz Gushiken announced that 
freedom of the press is \"not absolute\".  This is not the 
first time Gushiken has criticized the press: in April he had 
to retract a comment that the press ought to be focused on a 
\"positive agenda\" rather than \"fomenting discord\", and in May 
he suggested that the critical New York Times reporter was 
working for the US government.  Lula\'s Chief of Staff Jose 
Dirceu struck back at critics in remarks before an August 14 
PT party gathering, calling opponents \"terrorists\" seeking to 
\"limit the debate by shouting\".  He also slammed this week\'s 
edition of VEJA magazine that has a cover with an ominous PT 
party eyeball over the title \'Authoritarian Temptation\'. 
Dirceu said, \"we struggled for democracy against many of 
those who are shouting now, including some of these magazines 
that openly supported the military dictatorship.\" 
 
BANESTADO AND IBSEN PINHEIRO 
---------------------------- 
7. (SBU) Two recent cases have brought the issue of 
journalistic ethics into focus.  The first is the Banestado 
scandal, a long-running congressional inquiry into a massive 
money-laundering scheme.  In recent weeks there has been a 
steady stream of leaks --both substantiated and not-- from 
confidential banking records collected by the inquiry. 
 
SIPDIS 
Central Bank President Henrique Meirelles and Bank of Brazil 
President Cassio Casseb are among those being tarred by the 
press for alleged misdeeds (ref A).  Workers\' Party and 
administration officials have charged that the PSDB Senator 
who chairs the inquiry is leaking information for political 
ends, and that the press is tacitly complicit by not 
verifying the anonymous allegations.  In the second case, 
this week\'s \"ISTO E\" magazine carries a cover story in which 
a former reporter admits that an error he made in a 1993 
story about corruption wrongly led to the expulsion from 
Congress of Federal Deputy Ibsen Pinheiro.  Ironically, the 
congressional staffer who gave the journalist the false 
information was none other than Waldomiro Diniz, who in 
February 2004 was fired from his job as a senior political 
advisor in Lula\'s office for soliciting bribes from a numbers 
racketeer.  This fact fuels opposition claims that in the 
past the PT used anonymous leaks to attack political 
opponents but now, in power, seeks to stifle the practice. 
 
COMMENT - JOURNALISM BILL UNLIKELY TO PASS 
------------------------------------------ 
8. (SBU)  Some of Brazil\'s older journalists remember the 
days of self-censorship under the military regime, and they 
are quick to condemn government efforts to restrict the 
press.  Thus, sensitivity to perceived attempts to limit the 
press is a healthy part of the consolidation of Brazil\'s 
democracy, even if some of the criticism about the Journalism 
bill comes across as a bit hysterical.  And the bill is not 
necessary.  The press here has its strengths and weaknesses, 
and there are well-used libel laws to address the latter. 
The national papers are reasonably good, represent a range of 
editorial perspectives, and have a healthy competition for 
readers.  Thus there is not a pressing need for a set of 
nationwide councils to \"orient, discipline, and oversee\" 
journalists. 
 
9. (SBU) Even before the formal debate has begun in Congress, 
the bill has generated staunch opposition both within the 
government coalition and in the opposition parties.  It is 
unlikely to ever win a congressional majority.  Its most 
likely fate is to waste away, unmourned, in a committee or to 
be pulled out of Congress by the administration for \"further 
review\".  Politically, the bill is not worth the grief that 
the administration is getting for it, particularly in advance 
of October\'s municipal elections, and when there is good 
economic news and Lula\'s popularity has rebounded (ref B). 
The administration is now drafting an Audiovisual bill to 
promote domestic film and TV content.  The text is not yet 
public and has not been sent to Congress, but industry 
critics say it also injects government interference into 
broadcasting content.  Look for this bill to be watered down 
considerably if it ever is sent to Congress.

SUMMARY 
 ------- 
 
1.  (C) Brazil\'s Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM) and 
Amazon Protection System (SIPAM) continue to show progress 
and increased operational capabilities.  SIVAM\'s data 
collection infrastructure is almost complete; SIPAM continues 
to create new map products for use by government and 
non-governmental organizations.  However, even with SIVAM 
fully in place, many aircraft will still be able to avoid 
detection by flying below radar patterns and look-down radar 
on airborne platforms will not have continuous coverage.  To 
provide a seamless radar picture over its frontiers, Brazil 
is actively seeking cooperative arrangements with neighboring 
countries.  Ultimately, both SIVAM and SIPAM will only be as 
effective as the GOB\'s efforts to utilize the information 
generated, whether to control Brazilian airspace or to 
protect the environment.   End Summary 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2.  (C) Emboffs accompanying CAPSTONE National Defense 
University (NDU) team to Brazil\'s Amazon Surveillance System 
(SIVAM) and Amazon Protection System (SIPAM) regional centers 
in Manaus received in-depth briefing on the current status of 
the two co-located facilities from Air Force Brigadier 
General Alvaro Luiz Pinheiro, Vice President of the 
Commission for Implementation of Air Space Control (CISCEA) 
and the Coordinating Commission for the Amazon Surveillance 
System (CCSIVAM).  SIVAM Commandant Colonel Scariot and SIPAM 
regional chief Engineer Captain Luciano also participated in 
the August 10 visit. 
 
3.  (U) Brazil\'s Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM) is an 
integrated data collection project that utilizes a wide 
variety of data acquisition tools throughout the Amazon 
basin\'s 5.2 million square kilometers.  Developed by Raytheon 
and ATECH Technologies (Brazil), the multi-layered system 
includes aerial surveillance, transportable ground based and 
meteorological radars, airborne remote sensing and 
surveillance platforms (Embraer R99-A and R99-B aircraft), 
environmental and river sensors, weather ground stations, 
lightning detectors, surveillance and meteorological 
satellite observation, and even spot  submissions from 
individual informants.  Using the extensive raw data 
collected by SIVAM, the Amazon Protection System (SIPAM) 
integrates, evaluates, and disseminates the information into 
packages for distribution to end-user Brazilian agencies and 
non-governmental organizations.  To complete the SIPAM 
information network, end-user terminals are being placed in 
each of the Amazon region\'s 257 municipalities with over 
10,000 inhabitants. 
 
4.  (SBU) Almost all of SIVAM\'s multi-layered data collection 
mechanisms are up and running; only a few of the facility\'s 
information collection and observation components are still 
not fully functional.  In coordination with SIPAM which 
provides integrated data analysis, a detailed geographic 
information system (GIS) portrait of the Amazon basin is 
emerging rapidly.  Increasingly, the data and data-created 
products are being shared in real time with appropriate 
military and civilian endusers.  The air traffic control 
component of the Amazon Region Air Traffic Control and 
Integrated Air Defense System (CINDACTA IV) is showing 
progress. The next stage in SIVAM/SIPAM development, 
resulting in greater control of Brazilian airspace and 
protection and sustainable development of the Amazon, will 
rely on improved coordination among government and 
non-government entities. 
 
Air Defense and Control by 2005 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Utilizing SIVAM data, the Air Traffic Control and 
Integrated Air Defense System for the Amazon (CINDACTA IV), a 
component of Brazil\'s national Air Defense and Air Traffic 
Control System (SISDACTA), should be fully operational by 
early 2005. (Note: Brazil\'s other regional ATC and air 
defense systems, CINDACTA I, II, and III are already 
operational. End Note)  Two transportable 3D radars are not 
yet operational; other systems, including VHF radio, should 
be completed within a few months.  To identify unauthorized 
aircraft and airspace incursions from neighboring countries, 
air-air, air-ground, and spot (look-down) SAR airborne 
sensors onboard the system\'s three R99-B aircraft provide 
high resolution imaging and surface information that in 
combination with surface radar systems, and when the R99-B 
aircraft are aloft, provides complete vertical airspace 
coverage.  Low-flying intruding aircraft, however, can avoid 
radar detection over much of the Amazon when the surveillance 
planes are grounded or unavailable in the particular region. 
(Note: Given the costs associated with keeping the three 
R99-Bs aloft, the planes at present will be utilized only 
when and where collaborating information suggests airspace 
incursions are occurring or will occur at a given date and 
time.  End note)  Pinheiro indicated that during CINDACTA 
IV\'s short lifespan to date, it has monitored a 30 percent 
increase in regional air traffic -- a result of increased air 
traffic communications between pilots and ATC stations rather 
than an increase in flights. \"When pilots know they are being 
monitored, they are more prone to acknowledge their presence 
and file a flight plan,\" he observed. 
 
Hand Across the Borders 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Pinheiro believed full air defense and traffic 
control (ATC) throughout the Amazon will be achieved by June 
2005; key to this achievement, he noted, will be ATC 
coordination and integration with Brazil\'s neighbors.  In 
previous discussions with mission personnel, the GOB had 
indicated its desire to enter into SIVAM cost-sharing 
arrangements over ATC data.  Pinheiro was certain that Brazil 
no longer sought cost reimbursement from other governments. 
Instead, Brazil\'s current objective is the creation of a 
seamless radar overlap with all its neighbors extending 50 
miles on each side of Brazil\'s borders.  Each regional 
CINDACTA, Pinheiro explained, has been given the go ahead by 
Brasilia to develop local data sharing mechanisms with 
neighboring countries.  (Note: Mission has not yet been able 
to confirm with other Ministry of Defense sources whether 
regional CINDACTAs are, in fact, tasked to develop 
transborder data sharing mechanisms. End note) With Peru, for 
example, since both Ministries of Defense had agreed to terms 
of reference for real time data sharing, Pinheiro affirmed 
that CINDACTA IV and its Peruvian counterpart were in the 
process of establishing close border radar overlap 
capability.  Colombia, he said, wanted to do the same, 
although the GOC\'s desire to obtain data for Brazilian 
airspace beyond the 50 mile border zone, he noted, was a 
\"non-starter.\"  Brazil already works closely with Colombia on 
information sharing, and both Venezuela and French Guiana 
have expressed interest in developing joint ATC operations. 
While Bolivia does not have its own operating sensors, 
Pinheiro added, Brazil is considering provision of surplus 
radar units as it upgrades its own radars. 
 
7.  (C) Pinheiro and Scariot opined that when fully 
operational, the coordinated CINDACTA IV ATC system, in 
conjunction with implementation of Brazil\'s Lei de Abate 
(\"Shootdown\" Law) in October, would be sufficient in 
dissuading airborne narcotrafficking in the Amazon \"without 
recourse to actually shooting any aircraft from the sky.\" 
Pinheiro added that the SIVAM observation platform will also 
serve to deny the use of illicit airfields which can now be 
more easily located and targeted for action. 
 
 
SIVAM Products 
-------------- 
 
8.  (U) As a data collection system SIVAM generates a range 
of products for use by the Amazon Protection System (SIPAM) 
or other end-users.  Among the raw products promoted by the 
SIVAM Coordinating Commission (CCSIVAM) are: 
 
-   Meteorological:  Satellite images, real-time 
meteorological situation maps, historical and current climate 
study statistics, weather forecasts for airports, and 
accumulated precipitation and lightning reports; 
 
-   Electromagnetic Surveillance:  Emission contact and map 
data and communications networks; 
 
-   Environmental:  Groundcover maps and general reports, 
land use and environmental impact maps, soil damage maps, 
fauna and habitat classification maps, deforestation maps and 
fire incidence reports, mercury contamination reports, local 
and regional CO2 and O3 concentrations, statistical reports 
on greenhouse gas data, pollution threats to human 
populations, water quality and hydrographic maps, flood 
prevention and flood forecasting reports, urbanization impact 
maps and statistical reports, and epidemiological studies; 
 
-   Territorial Surveillance: Real-time airborne and surface 
vehicle movement and trajectories, identified target maps, 
border violation maps, irregular cultivation maps, 
biodiversity extraction and illicit mining maps, geologic 
maps, and locations of detected (irregular and perhaps 
illicit) rest-stops. 
 
SIPAM and its Activities 
------------------------ 
 
9.  (C) Past visits by mission personnel to the co-located 
SIVAM/SIPAM complex in Manaus suggested a clear dichotomy 
between the two entities.  While the two entities remain 
separate with SIVAM providing the raw data to SIPAM, the 
separation may be less distinct than before.  Moreover, 
bureaucratic concerns about allowing uniformed visitors into 
SIPAM may be lessening. During the CAPSTONE/NDU visit, SIPAM 
regional chief Captain Luciano welcomed the opportunity to 
display his center\'s sophisticated GIS capabilities.  For 
example, he demonstrated how SIPAM\'s environmental analysis 
unit incorporates SIVAM data into usable tools (e.g. maps of 
deforestation trends, forest fire monitoring, land use maps) 
for GOB entities such as the Ministry of Environment. The 
meteorological cell which has grown dramatically in just a 
few months, would soon be going to a 24/7 operation schedule, 
Luciano said.  In addition to direct links with GOB agencies, 
workspace within SIPAM is being provided to NGOs engaged in 
Amazon field work.  Luciano acknowledged that with SIPAM\'s 
rapid development of new data tools, data storage is becoming 
an increasing challenge. 
 
10. (U) Luciano expressed pride in the progress the Amazon 
Protection System has made in recent months and highlighted 
SIPAM\'s key focus areas: 
 
-   Environmental protection; 
-   Land use supervision and control; 
-   Border surveillance and control; 
-   Prevention and control of epidemics; 
-   Civil defense activities; 
-   Identification of punishable illegal activities; 
-   Protection of indigenous populations and their land; 
-   Air traffic control and surveillance; 
-   Support for sustainable development; 
-   Weather forecasting; and 
-   Climate studies. 
 
11. (SBU) Comment:  While SIVAM and SIPAM continue to show 
noteworthy progress, the ultimate success of these programs 
will be measured if/when/to what extent Brazilian agencies 
and NGOs utilize the new information tools provided. 
Ultimately, more rigorous environmental protection, 
sustainable development of the Amazon, and greater 
surveillance of Brazilian airspace leading to reduced 
narcotrafficking will be SIVAM/SIPAM\'s most important 
achievements.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (SBU) Brazilian Foreign Ministry officials assured 
Ambassador Siv that Brazil will wholeheartedly back the USG 
TIP agenda item at the 59th UNGA, but sounded more 
ambivalent on the four other U.S. UNGA initiatives (Ref C). 
To Ambassador Siv\'s suggestion that UNHCR has become a 
group mingling \"the good, the bad, and the ugly\" of which 
Sudan, Zimbabwe and Cuba have no right to be members, 
Foreign Ministry Chief of Staff Patriota courteously 
demurred that individual nations \"including Brazil\" display 
their own good, bad and ugly aspects, and that Libya\'s 
positive evolution shows that engagement, not 
ostracism/expulsion, is the wise course.  The Foreign- 
Ministry expert on President Lula\'s global anti- 
hunger/poverty project stressed that the aim of Lula\'s 
September 20 UN event is not to win endorsement of any 
particular text or design, but rather to raise the profile 
of world attention to the subject and gain a follow-up 
mandate to identify mechanisms that can be pursued 
multilaterally, to make development flows more stable, 
predictable, and sustainable.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) In Brasilia August 19, U.S. Representative to the 
U.N. Economic and Social Council Ambassador Sichan Siv 
discussed USG initiatives for the 59th UN General Assembly 
in an office meeting with Minister Maria Luiza Veotti, head 
of the GOB\'s MFA Human Rights and Social Issues Department, 
and over lunch hosted by Ambassador Danilovich with Foreign 
Minister Amorim\'s chief-of-staff Antonio Patriota and 
special advisor on President Lula\'s global hunger/poverty 
relief initiative Maria Nazareth Farani Azevedo.  In both 
meetings, Ambassador Siv detailed the USG\'s five main UNGA 
initiatives: Advancing Economic Freedom; Combating 
Trafficking in Persons; Promoting Democracy; Banning Human 
Cloning; and Reducing Middle East Resolutions (Ref C). 
 
3.  (SBU) Formerly based at the Brazilian UN Mission and 
less than two weeks in her new job, Minister Veotti was 
brief and general in most responses, readily volunteering 
that she was not yet conversant with details on all five 
items.  On economic freedom, she said President Lula 
supports and has been active in implementing Monterrey 
Consensus principles and international cooperation to 
underpin economic freedom.  She noted the record of GoB 
support for and participation in the Community of 
Democracies, but also tentative reservations about the idea 
of forming a democracy caucus in the UN, wondering whether 
that might upset the balance with which traditional UN 
groups work and introduce new polarity.  She outlined GOB 
efforts to combat TIP and noted that the Foreign Ministry 
has formed a special unit to deal with the subject.  About 
the Middle East, she reiterated that the GOB supports a 
balanced approach that addresses human rights without 
ignoring issues of terrorism.  Finally, Minister Veotti 
noted that the GOB endorses human cloning for medical but 
not for reproductive reasons, and that a separate office 
has the Foreign-Ministry lead on the issue. 
 
4.  (U) A propos the TIP issue, Ambassador Danilovich took 
the occasion to mention that A/S Maura Harty is shortly due 
to visit Brazil.  Ambassador Siv observed that in various 
nations there are many arrests of traffickers-in-persons 
but that subsequent prosecution was ineffective.  Does 
Brazil have a central coordinator for this sphere?  Veotti 
confirmed that the National Ministry of Justice was the 
authorized agent. 
 
5.  (SBU) Ambassador Danilovich hosted a subsequent lunch 
for Ambassador Siv attended by Foreign Minister Amorim\'s 
Chief of Staff Antonio Patriota and Special Advisor on 
President Lula\'s global hunger/poverty relief initiative 
Maria Nazareth Farani Azevedo.  With Ambassador Siv making 
the same exposition of the UNGA agenda points, Ambassador 
Patriota gave ready, meticulous overviews of those issues 
and others, as below. 
 
-- Middle East:  Ambassador Patriota registered the USG 
concerns about reducing the volume of motions, often 
repetitive and unconstructive, on the Middle East at the 
UNGA.  He said Brazil is interested in trying to help \"put 
hope back into the peace process,\" and noted that the MRE 
has just appointed, for the first time in Brazil\'s 
diplomatic history, a special roving envoy to the Middle 
East.  In addition, Brazil now has a seated diplomat in 
Ramallah, Ambassador Bernardo Brito, a seasoned senior 
official known for \"doing a good job in tough places,\" 
Patriota said.  An MRE diplomat at the Minister-Counselor 
level is also now based in Amman, covering Iraq.  Patriota 
further noted a recent meeting in which Norway\'s Foreign 
Minister and FM Amorim discussed working together on the 
Middle East, with reference to the early promise of the 
Oslo agreement and the potential synergy of \"a small but 
developed nation working closely with a large, developing 
country\" on some initiatives.   Brazil is proceeding with 
its previous plans for a meeting in Brazil, probably in 
April 2005, of Arab nations, with a focus on economic and 
commercial issues, Patriota said.  He acknowledged the 
potential for political polemics and anti-Israeli 
diatribes, but said the GOB would work hard to discourage 
and minimize such rhetoric.  The GOB is considering 
inviting Iraq, he added. 
 
-- Africa:  In response to an appeal by Ambassador Siv for 
Brazilian support in helping ameliorate instability and 
poverty in Bissau, Minister Maria Nazareth Farani outlined 
a new Brazil-India-South Africa joint initiative there, 
aimed at technical and financial assistance to build 
productivity especially in agriculture.  The initiative is 
the first of a series for Africa that Brazil is discussing 
with South Africa and India.  While relatively modest in 
scope, the project signals Brazil\'s concern about the 
extreme misery and restive military in the Portuguese- 
speaking country, Patriota added. 
 
-- Haiti:  Patriota had just returned from accompanying FM 
Amorim and President Lula to Haiti and the Dominican 
Republic, and he expressed glowing satisfaction with the 
success and symbolism of the previous day\'s famous soccer 
match between Brazil and Haiti, attended by Lula and his 
retinue.  The game was symbolic of the \"genuine affinity 
and dialogue\" between Haitians and Brazilians that is 
helping facilitate MINUSTAH\'s work, he said.  He further 
noted that feelings within Brazil had been mixed with 
regard to Brazil\'s leadership of MINUSTAH, with criticisms 
of the mission having come from the far-left of Lula\'s 
ruling PT party.  The success thus far of Brazil\'s PKO 
effort has \"vindicated\" the position adopted by Lula and 
Amorim that Brazil had a responsibility to help if it 
could. 
-- UNHRC and democracy initiatives:  Patriota respectfully 
demurred at Ambassador Siv\'s characterization of UNHRC 
having deteriorated into a collection of \"the good, the bad 
and the ugly,\" with some infamous rights violators now 
using member status in the forum to torpedo resolutions and 
actions against them.  Patriota said the GOB took the view 
that there is good, bad and ugly in each nation, \"including 
Brazil,\" and that efforts should be made to rehabilitate, 
not just confront.  He noted Libya as an example of a 
nation that had transformed from pariah status to 
collaborator with the world community.  Brazil would 
continue to oppose single-country resolutions and wants to 
explore mechanisms for broad \"objective\" reporting on 
problem areas by the UN. 
 
-- Human cloning:  Patriota noted that Brazil currently has 
\"some differences\" with the U.S. and said the issue is 
still not ripe for comprehensive discussion.  (Note: Brazil 
officially opposes reproductive cloning but would consider 
leaving an avenue for therapeutic cloning.  However, 
domestic legislation currently in Brazil\'s Congress could 
change GOB policy to that of blanket prohibition.  End 
Note.) 
 
6.  (SBU) Regarding Brazil\'s global hunger/poverty 
initiative, Farani stressed that President Lula\'s September 
20 New York event aims not for any final endorsement either 
of the text that Lula will present or of any specific 
financing or other mechanism.  Rather, the GoB aspiration 
is to raise the profile of world attention to this sphere 
and establish a follow-up mandate to identify mechanisms 
that can be followed multilaterally.  \"There are enough 
resources (for aid), but (they are) not being devoted to 
development... Getting this on the agenda could mean a 
healthy increase in attention. we are trying to discuss 
mechanisms that exist already and are doable... We\'re aware 
of the positions you have on certain issues,\" Farani said, 
without explicitly citing international taxation.  The 
ultimate need is for resources to be stable, predictable 
and in greater volumes so as to allow for a solid 
development strategy - rather than the present \"ad hoc and 
at times arbitrary funding\" that impedes development from 
being predictable or sustainable, in Farani\'s words. 
 
7.  (U) By the GoB\'s latest count, fifty-one countries, 
forty-eight to be represented by heads of state, and twelve 
international agencies will attend Lula\'s September 20 
announcement, Farani said.  Confirmed interest is so great, 
she went on, that the GoB organizers are having to think of 
a new format, since there will be, e.g., no possibility for 
every head of state to make an individual presentation, as 
originally projected. 
 
8.  (U) Aside from these meetings, Ambassador Siv during 
his Brasilia sojourn gave an interview to national daily 
\'Estado de Sao Paulo\' which printed an article the next 
day, and attended with Ambassador Danilovich a GoB memorial 
service for Brazilian-born UN diplomat Sergio De Mello on 
the anniversary of the Baghdad bombing that took the lives 
of de Mello and 21 other UN workers.  Rio daily \'O Globo\' 
printed Ambassador Siv\'s personal tribute to de Mello, his 
former colleague in Cambodian refugee resettlement in the 
early 1990s, in the form of an August 20 OpEd.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL:  POLICE SEIZE URANIUM ORE 
 
 
1.  (U) Brazilian Federal Police announced on Aug 24 the 
seizure last month of 1,320 pounds of uranium and thorium 
ore, the first time, according to press reports, that such a 
seizure has occurred in Brazil.  (Note:  In 2003 GOB 
officials told Poloff that they were unaware of any illicit 
trafficking of nuclear materials within Brazil. End note) 
The uranium and thorium ore, in granulated form, was taken 
from a van that was stopped for routine inspection about 120 
km. from Macapa, Amapa State.  The alleged owner of the ore 
was captured and charged with wrongful possession of illegal 
materials, punishable by up to six years in prison.  Police 
revealed that the shipment was bound for Sao Paulo for likely 
transshipment out of the country.  Value of the shipment was 
placed at USD 466,000.  Since the material seized by police 
was raw natural ore, the U-235 isotope content was no more 
than 0.7 percent. 
 
2.  (U) Experts from Brazil\'s National Nuclear Energy 
Commission and the National Department of Mineral Production 
told the press that while this was the first seizure of this 
type in Brazil, they suspected it was not the first time raw 
uranium ore had been smuggled from the remote mining site in 
Amapa State.  Officials described the amount of the seizure 
as \"very large\" and the operation as \"not amateurish.\"

SUBJECT: PIRACY CPI CONCLUDES; NEW LEGISLATION PUT FORWARD 
 
REFS: A) BRASILIA 2017 B) BRASILIA 1668 
 
1.  The highly respected Chamber of Deputies\' Parliamentary 
Investigative Commission (CPI) on Piracy (ref B) formally 
concluded its year-long proceedings on August 11, 2004.  In 
the three-hour-long closing ceremony, members of the 
commission and from the private sector uniformly stressed 
the need for a greater recognition within society of the 
importance of intellectual-property protection, and for 
active follow-up to the CPI\'s report.  In at times 
emotional statements, the Deputies called for a cultural 
mind-shift, emphasizing that beyond the self-evident 
economic damage caused by piracy -- the loss of tax 
revenues and of jobs, the stifling of creativity and 
innovation - basic governance in Brazil is threatened by 
the growth of the informal economy and of organized crime 
associated with piracy.  Deputy Semeghini noted with some 
consternation that the USG is threatening to remove trade 
benefits from Brazil under the Generalized System of 
Preferences for inadequate IPR protection at the very time 
Brazil is itself mobilizing to address the issue (ref A). 
 
2.  In a formal ceremony on August 12, Deputy Medeiros led 
the CPI in presenting the Commission\'s final report to 
President Lula, who was flanked by Minister of Political 
Coordination, Aldo Rebelo, and Minister of Justice Marcio 
Bastos.  President Lula did not speak, but Minister Bastos 
used the occasion to announce the formation of a public- 
private sector National Council for the Defense of 
Intellectual Property and for the Fight Against Piracy.  As 
of this report, the decree establishing this council is not 
final; report to follow septel. 
 
3.  As a result of their work, Deputies of the CPI 
introduced on July 16, 2004 five pieces of legislation, 
three aimed at stiffening penalties for copyright 
infringement.  Although the CPI deputies are intent on 
making this legislation a priority, it is unlikely the 
Brazilian Congress will pass these bills before spring of 
2005.  Below is Embassy\'s unofficial translation of one of 
the bills (the other four will be transmitted septel.)  The 
\"Justification\" which follows the text of the bill provides 
a summary of the changes being introduced into domestic IPR 
legislation and their rationale. 
 
4.  \"Bill PL 3964/2004 of the Piracy CPI 
 
Modifies Articles 184 and 186 and adds Article 184-A to the 
Penal Code; alters regulations in the Criminal Procedure 
Code, with regard to crimes against non-material property.

the intent to profit directly or indirectly, original or 
copy of an intellectual work or express audiovisual by any 
means or fixed in any support, tangible or intangible, 
produced or reproduced in violation of the author\'s rights, 
without the express authorization of the owners of the 
rights or those who represent them. 
 
Paragraph 3: ........................................... 
 
Paragraph 4: ........................................... 
 
Paragraph 5: Independent of the conviction of the 
perpetrator of the crime, whenever the counterfeiting of an 
intellectual work or industrial product is certified 
through an expert\'s finding, the judge can, ex officio, by 
means of a petition from the author whose rights were 
violated or by the Public Ministry, determine the 
destruction of the criminal production or reproduction, or 
send it to aid institutions or social programs that house 
minors or elderly people, as long as the substance is not 
detrimental to health or physical well-being.\" (new 
wording) 
 
Article 3 - Decree-law no. 2.848 of December 7, 1940, will 
now be amended to include the following Article 184-A: 
 
\"Article 184-A.  To publish, offer publicity services or

phonogram, videotape or any industrialized product 
registered under the terms of Law no. 9.279/96 without the 
express authorization of the owners of the rights or their 
representatives. 
 
Penalty - detention for 2 (two) years and 2 (two) months to 
4 (four) years, and a fine. 
 
Paragraph 1 - The same penalty applies to whoever divulges

the author of the counterfeiting is not identified and 
independent of his conviction. 
 
Paragraph 2 - In case of recidivism, the penalty will be 
increased by two-thirds.\" 
 
Article 4 - Clause II of Art. 186 of Decree-law no. 2.848, 
of December 7, 1940, will be amended to include the 
following text: 
 
\"Article 186 ........................................... 
 
II unconditional public penal action, for crimes covered in

Article 5 - Article nos. 527, 530-B to 530-F and 530-H of 
Decree-law no. 3.689, of October 3, 1941, will be amended 
to include the following text: 
 
\"Art. 527.  The search or seizure investigation, in the 
case of private penal action, will be performed by two 
experts named by the judge, who will verify the existence 
of grounds for the seizure, and whether this happens or 
not, the expert opinion will be presented within 3 (three) 
days after closure of the search process. (new wording) 
 
Art. 530-B.  In cases of infractions determined in the 
paragraphs of Articles 184, 184-A of the Penal Code and 
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 12 of Law no. 9.609/98, the 
police authority will proceed with the seizure of goods 
illegally produced or reproduced, support and material that 
contribute to counterfeiting, as long as they are 
principally destined to illegal practices or 
commercialization of their product. 
 
Art. 530-C.  At the time of seizure a document will be 
drafted, signed by 2 (two) or more witnesses, containing 
the description of all seized goods and information about 
the location of seizure, and, if possible, of the person 
who had them in his possession, in a way that will permit 
his identification and individualization, which will become 
an integral part of the police inquiry or trial. (new 
wording) 
 
Art. 530-D. Subsequent to the seizure, an investigation 
will be done, by official experts, or lacking these, by a 
technically apt person, on samples of the seized goods in 
sufficient quantity to prove the crime, and a report will 
be prepared that will become part of the police inquiry or 
trial. (new wording) 
 
Art. 530-E.  The titleholders of author\'s rights and those 
connected to them or, alternatively, the association of 
titleholders of author\'s rights and those connected to 
them, will be the true holders of all seized goods, placing 
them at the disposition of the judge during the trial. 
 
Art. 530-F.  Except for the necessity of preserving the 
corpus delicti (material evidence), the judge can 
determine, before passing sentence or during the 
inquisitorial phase, at the request of the injured party or 
the Public Ministry, the latter always being heard, the 
destruction of the seized production or reproduction when 
its legitimacy is not contested or when the penal action 
cannot be initiated due to lack of determination of the 
author of the crime. 
 
Sole paragraph: Independent of the conviction of the author 
of the crime, the judge can determine the use of the 
counterfeit merchandise by aid entities or social programs 
for children, adolescents or the aged, as long as it is not 
detrimental to the health or physical safety of the 
recipients. (new wording) 
 
Art. 530-H. The associations of copyright titleholders and 
those connected to them can, in their own name, function as 
assistants to the prosecution for the crimes determined in 
Art. 184 and 184-A of the Penal Code and art. 12 of Law no. 
9.609 of February 19, 1998, when those crimes are to the 
detriment of any of its associates. 
 
Article 6 - This law goes into effect on the date of its 
publication. 
 
JUSTIFICATION 
 
The bill that the Piracy CPI hereby presents has as its 
objective to modify the penal law in order to fight piracy, 
so prevalent in our society. 
 
During all these months of work, besides all those directly 
affected by piracy, the Commission heard various 
representatives of the Public Ministry.  They were 
unanimous in stating that despite the good intentions of 
the legislature with regard to Laws no. 9.099 and 10.259/00 
concerning Special Civil and Criminal State and Federal 
Judgeships respectively, the regulations in Art. 89 of Law 
9.099, described in Law no. 10.259/00, create the 
impression that piracy is a crime of lesser importance. 
 
These regulations concede the benefit of procedural sursis 
to the author of a crime whose minimum penalty is equal to 
or less than one year. 
 
Since as a result of the work done by the CPI the 
connection between piracy and organized crime became 
overwhelmingly proven, the stiffening of some penalties is 
necessary, not simply for the sake of saying that the law 
is rigorous, but to avoid that people involved in these 
criminal organizations operate on the margins of the law, 
freely transiting Brazilian territory, with so-called 
organized crime becoming more and more deeply rooted, and 
reinforcing a \"sense of impunity\". 
 
The minimum and maximum fines set forth in Article 184 were 
also removed, inasmuch as the system adopted in the general 
part of the Penal Code allows the imposition of even larger 
penalties.  Besides, it is known that monetary penalties in 
nominal values lose their impact over time, which is not 
desirable. 
 
Also, a provision was added to the Penal Code to establish 
as a crime the advertising (by various means), manufacture 
or acquisition of raw materials for the counterfeiting of 
pirated products, even in cases in which the identity of 
the counterfeiter is unknown and independent of the 
counterfeiter\'s conviction, because it is unacceptable to 
exclude this type of crime and culpability from the law 
when the perpetrator is unknown, since his existence is 
proven. 
 
Regarding the changes to the Criminal Procedure Code, we 
strove to make them compatible with changes made by this PL 
to the Penal Code, and, in the case of art. 530-B, 
determined that the investigations of search and seizure 
should encompass the totality of counterfeit merchandise 
and the equipment for its non-authorized production or 
reproduction, besides enabling the seizure of documents 
that can identify those who acquire the counterfeit 
material or the members that make up a specific gang. 
 
The modification of Article 530-C is to ensure that the act 
of seizure be as detailed as possible, since it becomes an 
integral part of the evidence. 
 
Currently, art. 530-D determines that an expert opinion on 
seized merchandise be done on all goods seized.  Seizures 
can consist of hundreds of thousands of units of the same 
product.  It is not reasonable to demand an expert opinion 
on all of them.  A sampling, in this case, is a measure of 
reasonability, by which we propose \"expert opinion on 
samples of the goods seized in a quantity sufficient to 
prove crime.\" 
 
Evoking the same measure of reasonability, we are proposing 
a change in Article 530-E, so that associations of 
titleholders of author\'s rights can be named valid holders, 
since most of the time it is impossible for an individual 
to maintain sufficient storage to accommodate the absurd 
amount of merchandise being seized in Brazil. 
 
Article 530-E is compatible with paragraph 5, inserted by 
us in Art. 184 of the Penal Code. 
 
Finally, the new version of Article 530-H allows that in 
new cases covered in Article 184-A of the Penal Code, 
contained in this bill, and in cases of Article 12 of Law 
no. 9.609 of February 19, 1998, that regulates the 
protection of software intellectual property, the 
associations of titleholders of author\'s rights and those 
connected to them can, in their own name, function as 
assistants to the prosecution. 
 
Through the above and the belief that the adoption of the 
measures hereby proposed will aid in the fight against 
piracy, the Piracy CPI counts on the support of the 
illustrious Deputies for the conversion of this bill into 
law.

1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered ref A talking points to Ministry 
of Foreign Relations Sensitive Technologies and Disarmament 
Division (MRE/DDS) Deputy Director Manuel Montenegro, who is 
well versed on Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) matters. 
Montenegro had participated in the recent NSG plenary meeting 
in Sweden and his comments likely reflect the thinking of his 
superiors within Itamaraty. Poloff also exchanged brief 
pleasantries with Ambassador Sergio Duarte, President of the 
2005 NPT Review Conference, and his assistant Jandyr Ferreira 
dos Santos. 
 
2.  (C) Responding to the Brazil specific points in ref A, 
Montenegro sought to clarify the GOB position on conclusion 
of the Additional Protocol (AP).  Montenegro stressed that 
the GOB does not have any \"conceptual\" problem with the AP 
and \"would get there eventually,\" implying a Brazilian 
disposition to sign the protocol at some point in the future. 
 However, Montenegro said he was certain that Brazil could 
not complete its internal policy consideration of the issue 
in time to adhere to the AP prior to the 2005 NPT Revcon.  In 
that regard, he noted that Brazil\'s congress had issued a 
\"caveat\" to the MRE that the congress wants to see \"concerted 
effort towards nuclear disarmament\" among weapons states if 
it is to consider approval of the Additional Protocol. (Note: 
Under Brazilian law, the Additional Protocol would almost 
certainly have to be approved by Brazil\'s congress, as it is 
a substantive addendum to an international treaty. End note.) 
 
 
3.  (C) Responding further to ref A points, Montenegro said 
Brazil continues to oppose implementation of the AP as a 
Condition of Supply (COS) for trigger list transfers in the 
NSG.  Montenegro was surprised that the USG was continuing to 
press for the UK/Austrian proposal to establish AP 
implementation as a COS since, following the NSG Plenary and 
after GOB delegation discussions with the UK and Austrian 
delegations, it was Montenegro\'s understanding that the 
UK/Austrian text was \"dead.\" Montenegro further said that the 
GOB is against the use of the NSG as a kind of \"cheerleader 
for the AP.\" 
 
4.  (C) Comment: Montenegro is a candid MRE specialist in 
non-proliferation issues, and we suspect he is offering a 
realistic assessment of the deliberate pace the GOB will take 
toward the AP, even as senior Brazilian officials continue to 
indicate a disposition to eventually sign on.  His assessment 
reinforces views expressed earlier this year by FM Amorim and 
Defense Minister Viegas to visiting Energy Secretary Abraham 
and former NP A/S Wolf (refs E and F). The public statements 
in April by Science and Technology Minister Campos that 
Brazil would sign the AP in time for the 2005 NPT Review 
Conference now seem isolated and too optimistic.  We believe 
the GOB\'s reservations probably continue to include: (1) 
reluctance to appear to bow to external pressures, from the 
USG, IAEA or in the context of the NSG; (2) concern with 
perceptions that the AP pressure on Brazil in some fashion 
lumps Brazil in the suspect company of North Korea and Iran, 
when the GOB feels Brazil ought to be seen as a model citizen 
in non-proliferation; (3) concern that the GOB needs an 
\"air-tight\" case on the merits of the AP before taking the 
matter to Brazil\'s congress, which only reluctantly ratified 
the NPT and may renew its criticisms of a perceived lack of 
disarmament progress among the weapons states.  We will 
continue to try to gain more clarity on the thinking within 
the GOB on these issues.

Wording) 
 
Article 4 - This law goes into effect on the date of its 
publication. 
 
JUSTIFICATION 
 
The bill that the Piracy CPI hereby presents has as its 
objective to modify the penal law, to combat piracy so 
prevalent in our society. 
 
During all these months of work, besides all those directly 
affected by piracy, the Commission heard various 
representatives of the Public Ministry.  They were 
unanimous in stating that despite the good intentions of 
the legislature with regard to Laws no. 9.099 and 10.259/00 
concerning Special Civil and Criminal State and Federal 
Judgeships respectively, the regulations in art. 89 of Law 
9.099, described in Law no. 10.259/00, create the 
impression that piracy is a crime of lesser importance. 
 
Subject determination concedes the benefit of procedural 
sursis to the author of a crime whose minimum penalty is 
equal to or less than one year. 
 
Since after the work done by CPI the connection between 
piracy and organized crime became overwhelmingly proven, 
the stiffening of some penalties is necessary, not simply 
to say that the law is rigorous, but to avoid that the 
people involved in these criminal organizations remain on 
the margins of the law, freely transiting the Brazilian 
territory, with so-called organized crime becoming more and 
more deep rooted, and reinforcing a \"sense of impunity\". 
 
This is why we are proposing an increase in the penalties 
currently in place from detention of three months to one 
year or fine to detention of two years and two months to 
four years and fine. 
 
The CPI is convinced that in addition to the force of the 
penalty of privation of liberty, the penalty of fines is 
essential as an educational tool; one should not substitute 
the other. 
 
The remaining changes were only to insert into four penal 
types the expression \"with the intent to profit\", excluding 
from the crime in this way, people who have practiced this 
behavior without this intent. 
 
Through the above and with the belief that the adoption of 
the measures hereby proposed will aid in the fight against 
piracy, the Piracy CPI counts on the support of the 
illustrious Deputies for the conversion of the bill into 
law.

2.  Bill 3966/2004 
  (of the Piracy CPI) 
 
Modifies Law no. 9.609/98, that regulates the protection of 
intellectual property and computer software 
 
The National Congress decrees: 
 
Article 1 - Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of Article 12 of Law no. 
9.609 of February 19, 1998, goes into effect with the 
following edits:

JUSTIFICATION 
 
The bill that the Piracy CPI hereby presents has as its 
objective to modify the penal law, to combat piracy so 
prevalent in our society. 
 
During all these months of work, besides all those directly 
affected by piracy, the Commission heard various 
representatives of the Public Ministry.  They were 
unanimous in stating that despite the good intentions of 
the legislature with regard to Laws no. 9.099 and 10.259/00 
concerning Special Civil and Criminal State and Federal 
Judgeships respectively, the regulations in art. 89 of Law 
9.099, described in Law no. 10.259/00, create the 
impression that piracy is a crime of lesser importance. 
Subject determination concedes the benefit of procedural 
sursis to the author of a crime whose minimum penalty is 
equal to or less than one year. 
 
Since as a result of the work done by the CPI the 
connection between piracy and organized crime became 
overwhelmingly proven, the stiffening of some penalties is 
necessary, not simply for the sake of saying that the law 
is rigorous, but to avoid that people involved in these 
criminal organizations operate on the margins of the law, 
freely transiting Brazilian territory, with so-called 
organized crime becoming more and more deeply rooted, and 
reinforcing a \"sense of impunity\". 
 
That is why we are proposing an increase in penalties from 
confinement from one to four years and fine to confinement 
from two years and two months to four years and fine. 
 
On the other hand, the creation of a new kind of penalty 
that regulates computer software, including various 
behaviors practiced in software piracy, like publication, 
offering publicity services, introducing by any means, 
conventional or electronic, ads or information destined to 
the purchase, sale, rental, import or export of original or 
copies of computer software in violation of author\'s 
rights. 
 
Finally, Art. 15, now inserted, gives indemnification to 
the owner of the violated rights, as mandated in Law. No. 
9.610/98, that deals with author\'s rights. 
 
Through the above and with the belief that the adoption of 
the measures hereby proposed will aid in the fight against 
piracy, the Piracy CPI counts on the support of the 
illustrious Deputies for the conversion of this bill into 
law.

2. Bill 3967/2004 
  (of the Piracy CPI) 
 
Modifies the penalty for crimes of contraband and receipt 
of illicit goods 
 
The National Congress decrees: 
 
Article 1 - This law increases the penalty for privation of 
liberty mandated for the crimes of contraband or smuggling 
and receipt of illicit goods, penalties restricting rights: 
 
Article 2 - Art. 180 and 334 of Decree-law no. 2.848 of 
December 7, 1940, enters into effect with the following 
edit: 
 
\"Art. 180 ....................... 
Penalty - confinement, from 1 (one) to 4 (four) year, and 
loss of the right to do business. 
 
Paragraph 1 ....................... 
Penalty - confinement from 3(three) to 8(eight) years, and 
loss of the right to do business.\" 
 
\"Art. 334. Import or export prohibited merchandise or 
evade, in full or in part, the payment of rights or taxes 
due on the entrance, or the exit or consumption of 
merchandise: 
Penalty - confinement, from 1(one) to 4(four) years and 
loss of merchandise and the vehicle used to effect the 
entrance or exit, as well as losing the right to do 
business.\" 
 
Article 3 - This law goes into effect on the date of its 
publication. 
 
JUSTIFICATION 
 
The bill that the Piracy CPI hereby presents has as its 
objective modification of the penal law to combat piracy so 
prevalent in our society. 
 
In Foz do Iguacu there are many buses that cross the border 
every day.  These buses, contrary to what might be 
expected, don\'t carry passengers, as they don\'t even have 
seats.  They are true cargo carriers, loaded with 
merchandise that is illegal either because it can\'t come 
into the country or because it came in without paying the 
taxes due. 
 
In the same way, throughout Brazil stores sell pirated 
merchandise; when there is an investigation, we seize it, 
and the next day they are back in business with hundreds 
more illegal products. 
 
The objective of this bill is, besides the deprivation of 
liberty already proscribed by the law, to deprive merchants 
who sell illegal products of the right to do business and 
those who promote contraband to lose the means of transport 
through which the crime was committed, in addition to the 
merchandise, which is often not even seized. 
 
With the hope that these measures help to decrease the 
entrance of illegal products into the country, we count on 
the support of the illustrious Deputies for approval of 
this project.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL: PIRACY CPI\'S FIFTH IPR BILL 
 
REFS: A) BRASILIA 2150 B) BRASILIA 2017 C) BRASILIA 1668 
 
1.  This is the final cable in a series of five on 
legislation put forward on July 16, 2004 by Deputies 
belonging to the Congressional Investigative Commission on 
Piracy (reftels).  Below is Embassy\'s unofficial 
translation of the text of the fifth bill. 
 
2. Bill 3968/2004 
  (of the Piracy CPI) 
 
Regulates the installation of a System of Flow Measurement 
(SMV) in industrial beverage establishments and provides 
other provisions. 
 
The National Congress decrees: 
 
Art. 1 - This law determines the installation of equipment 
to measure flow and conductivity and equipment to control, 
register and mark the quantities measured in the industrial 
establishments of beverages, alcoholic beverages and 
vinegars classified in position 2202 and 2203 of the Table 
of Incidence of Tax on Industrialized Products (TIPI), 
according to regulation. 
 
Art. 2 - The System of Flow Measurement (SMV) should be 
installed by industrial establishments covered under this 
law on each filler, understood as the equipment utilized to 
fill the barrels in which the beverage is conditioned for 
final sale to the consumer. 
 
Sole paragraph.  The system described in the caput should 
continuously measure the flow, electric conductivity and 
temperature of the liquids that feed each filler and flow 
through the tubing to which it is associated, without 
interfering with the regular process of beverage 
manufacture. 
 
Art. 3 - This law applies to all industrial beverage 
establishments subject to the IPI tax regulations according 
to current legislation, except those whose installed annual 
production capacity is less than five million liters, 
computing capacities of respective branches, associated 
companies, partners, controlled and controllers. 
 
Art. 4 - These industrial establishments have twelve months 
from the publication of this law to install said equipment 
and equipment for flow control. 
 
Art. 5 - The States, Federal District and Municipalities 
can make an agreement with the Union to operate together 
with the Union in the establishment of criteria and 
installation procedures, inspection and control of the Flow 
System. 
 
Art. 6 - This law goes into effect on the date of its 
publication. 
 
JUSTIFICATION 
 
During public meetings, one of the measures adopted by the 
Federal Government in 2001 to inhibit counterfeiting and 
tax evasion was mentioned, a project for installing flow 
measurement by manufacturers of beer and soft drinks, 
established by Federal Revenue, based on Provisional 
Measure no. 2.158-35 of August 24, 2001. 
 
On May 3, 2004, through Of. No. 689/2004, the Presidency of 
CPI requested information about the status of the project 
in question. 
 
In response to our request, SRF sent us a note with the 
following clarifications: 
 
(...) 
 
2. The requirement for the installation of Flow Measurers 
by manufacturers of beer and soft drinks was established by 
art. 36da Provisional Measure no. 2.158-35 of August 24, 
2001, regulated by SRF through Normative Instruction SRF 
no. 265, of December 20, 2002 that attributed to the 
General Coordination of Inspection (Cofis) the 
responsibility for establishing: 
a) conditions of operation, as well as technical 
characteristics and equipment safety; 
b) procedures for ratification and licensing of equipment 
and respective manufacturers of same; 
c) minimum limits of production or invoicing, starting at 
which the installation of equipment becomes mandatory; 
3. SRF, with the purpose of initiating the process of 
implantation in the sector of beer manufacture, signed 
several technical cooperation agreements with the National 
Union of the Beer Industry (SINDICERV), as well as States 
of the Federation, such as Bahia, Pernambuco, Ceara, Para, 
Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Parana, for the 
specification and installation of flow meters; in addition 
to the objective previously mentioned, also promotes the 
interchange of information and interchange of mutual 
assistance in the supervision of tax compliance, which will 
permit significantly greater control of this segment of 
fiscal interest. 
 
4. The General Coordination of Inspection, with reference 
to above-mentioned items \"a\" and \"c\", then edited the 
Executive Declarative Act Cofis no. 20, of October 1, 2003, 
undertaking the specification of requirements for the 
System of Flow Measure to be installed in the beer 
industry. 
 
5. The System of Flow Measurement will be composed of flow 
measuring equipment, conduction meters as well as equipment 
for the control, recording, marking and remote transmission 
of the quantities measured to SRF.  The System of Flow 
Measurement should continuously monitor production of 
fluids in the industrial establishments where it is 
installed, with the following functions: 
 
- measurement of flow (that is volume by unit and time); 
- measurement of electric conductivity and temperature of 
the liquids that feed each filler; 
- record measurements obtained from the flow, conductivity 
and temperature and make this information available for use 
by the Secretary of Federal Revenue; 
- remote communication with systems at the Secretary of 
Federal Revenue, for the transfer of recorded information. 
 
6. The measurement of electrical conductivity and 
temperature will allow, under certain conditions, the 
differentiation between types of liquids that feed a 
filler.  The flow measurements supplied by SMV will allow 
an estimate to be made of the volume of fluids produced, in 
a specific period of time, at an industrial establishment. 
 
7. The System of Flow Measurement for the beer industry, is 
in a phase of validation of norms and procedures related to 
the installation, verification of conformity and 
registration of the system to be established by an 
Executive Declarative Act by Cofis.  After publication of 
said act, the first equipment should be installed in a 
maximum of three months, and expectations are to install it 
on all beer production lines nationwide within six months, 
counted from the first equipment registered by SRF. 
 
8. With reference to the soft drink industry, an agreement 
was signed on April 27, 2004 between SRF and the Brazilian 
Association of Soft Drink Industry (ABIR) for the 
implementation of a System of Flow Measurement for the 
sector.  The expectation is that there will be a reduced 
time frame for this segment due to the similarity in 
equipment and their requirements (...) 
According to the information received from SRF, it is felt 
that the project of installation of flow meters, short and 
medium term, is the solution for the control of 
counterfeiting of drinks and consequent tax evasion. 
 
It is also felt, however, that specific legislation 
currently in force, needs refinement with regard to 
definition of capacity and responsibilities for the 
improvement of control of the Flow Measurement System. 
 
Therefore, CPI debated presenting the bill mandating 
installation of flow measurement equipment in industrial 
establishments of beverages classified under TIPI, except 
those whose annual installed production capacity is less 
than five million liters, when computing the capacity of 
respective branches, associated companies, partners, 
controlled and controllers. 
 
The project also determined that Federal Revenue, INMETRO 
and ANVISA, within the scope of their power, define the 
flow parameters, electric conductivity, liquid temperature 
and interference caused by the flow system in the process 
of drink manufacture. 
 
Since this is precision equipment that requires investment 
by the industries, it will be convenient to allow a period 
of 12 months from publication of the law so that industry 
and public entities have time to make adjustments necessary 
to install the Flow System. 
 
In the end, the efficiency of the Flow System should be 
achieved with the joint efforts of the Union, States, DF 
and municipalities in the elaboration of procedures for 
installation, inspection and control of the Flow System, 
which is why the proposal anticipates an agreement between 
the Union and the rest of the entities. 
 
We are convinced that this proposal will make possible not 
just the fight against counterfeiting and evasion, but will 
permit better conditions for Brazil\'s participation in the 
highly competitive and global market that is today\'s 
beverage market.

1.   (SBU) Summary:  The Brazilian economy grew another 1.5% 
in the second quarter of 2004, marking the third consecutive 
quarter of growth at an annual rate of over 6%, according to 
official figures released August 31.  While still 
preliminary, the growth data confirm what all other recent 
economic data points have been indicating:  the Brazilian 
economy is growing healthily.  The continued economic 
recovery removes a key GoB (and PT party) concern:  Lula, 
Palocci and Meirelles can confidently assert vindication for 
their austere macroeconomic policies.  The grass-roots 
question ahead of October\'s municipal elections remains:  to 
what degree is Brazil\'s job and personal-income growth is 
shifting Brazilian voters\' perceptions of their own economic 
well-being to Lula\'s political benefit?  Two threats to the 
sustainability of the recovery are inflationary pressures 
and the continued lack of Congressional action on the GoB 
structural reforms.  End Summary. 
 
2.   (U) GoB end-August figures show that the Brazilian 
economy grew 1.5% in the second quarter of 2004, as compared 
to the first quarter.  Parsing the numbers, on the supply 
side Services led growth with a surprising 2.5% increase 
over the previous quarter.  Agriculture output fell slightly 
(-0.3%), while industry grew 0.2%.  On the demand side, 
Consumption and Investment each grew 1.5%, exports grew a 
further 2.2%.  Import growth of 1.6% and government 
consumption growth of 0.2% round out the picture.

3.   (U) Investment spending, which grew 1.5% quarter-on- 
quarter, continues to be a significant factor leading this 
economic recovery, as it has from the start.  The solid 
growth in private consumption (1.5%), however, suggests that 
recent growth in real incomes is feeding through to 
consumption decisions.  If sustained, that growth in 
consumption bodes well for the sustainability of the 
recovery.  It also was likely a factor in the surprisingly 
strong showing of services (up 2.5%) in the quarter.  And 
while the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of exports was 
down, this merely reflects a modest lessening from the 
record levels of the previous quarter.  Accumulated growth 
in exports in the first half of 2004 was 17.8%. 
4.   (U) With the strength of current GDP recovery now 
beyond dispute, pessimists are proceeding to worry that its 
sustainability will be put at risk from emerging 
inflationary threats and the continued failure of the 
Congress to act on the microeconomic and structural reform 
agenda.  On the former point, the recently released notes 
from the August Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) meeting 
suggest that the Central Bank is now focused on inflationary 
threats, exacerbated by high capacity utilization in 
industry and high energy prices.  While some commentators 
point to slow wage growth and still high unemployment as 
mitigating inflationary pressures, financial markets, 
already resigned to having the Central Bank keep the base 
interest rate (SELIC) at 16% for the rest of the year, are 
starting to talk if not bet on a SELIC interest-rate 
increase before 2005. 
 
5.   (U) Meanwhile, the GoB\'s microeconomic reform agenda 
remains stalled in the Congress, which looks unlikely to 
push through any major legislation ahead of the October 
municipal elections.  Planning Minister Mantega last week 
publicly branded the Congress\'s failure to pass the Public- 
Private Partnership (PPP) law -- the key GoB measure to 
increase investment in infrastructure and measures to de- 
bottleneck the economy.  For the first time by any top GoB 
official, Mantega talked of enacting the legislation through 
executive decree.  The GoB did recently enact via decree a 
series of adjustments to tax rates designed to foster long- 
term savings. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU) While enactment of the PPP legislation via decree 
would be of dubious constitutionality and is a probable non- 
starter, Mantega\'s utterance may accurately reflect the GoB 
concern at loss of legislative momentum on its microeconomic 
reform agenda.  The GoB sees the much-delayed PPP law in 
particular as key to increasing infrastructure investment 
and eliminating bottlenecks.  One of the key questions going 
forward is whether investment levels under present 
conditions will lead to sufficient capacity expansion 
quickly enough to stave off new inflation.  Such longer-term 
preoccupations aside, the economic news these days is good 
enough that the economy should at least be less of a 
negative for the PT and GoB in the October elections.  How 
much so depends on how quickly and perceptibly the recovery 
feeds through to consumers\' pocketbooks.

TAGS: ECON, SOCI, EFIN, BR, Economic Policy & General Analysis 
SUBJECT: REAL LIFE BRAZIL: THE DOWNS AND UPS OF RUNNING A 
SMALL BUSINESS 
 
 
1. Summary:  Despite recent discussion of reforms to aid 
small businesses and reduce red tape, owners of small 
businesses in Brazil still struggle with suffocating 
bureaucratic requirements, unfavorable labor laws and 
expensive credit.  This cable is a case study of a Sao 
Paulo state small business struggling to overcome these 
obstacles.  Bureaucracy reigns:  obtaining official permits 
to open the small food service business in question took 
over four months, even with a professional facilitator. 
The difficulties of firing even non-performing workers 
under Brazilian labor resulted in a lawsuit against this 
small business.  Credit can be had, but at usurious rates. 
Despite these challenges, and unlike a large number of 
other Brazilian small businesses, this entrepreneur has 
chosen not to operate in the informal economy.  End 
summary. 
 
2. During a recent holiday, ECON OMS visited a long-time 
Brazilian friend, Roseli, who runs a marmitex restaurant 
service.  \"Marmitex\" are prepackaged meals wrapped in 
aluminum foil and sold at a set price. 
 
3. Roseli had worked for 15 years in large multinationals 
as a financial analyst, and left to pursue her dream of 
setting up her own business.  She identified the marmitex 
niche in Sorocaba, a town of some 400,000 inhabitants 
located around 100 kilometers from the city of Sao Paulo, 
known for manufacturing automotive parts, with the presence 
of some well-known industrial names like GM, Alcoa and 
Votorantim.  For her customer base, she is targeting small 
and medium businesses that are mandated by Brazilian law to 
provide meals to their employees. 
 
4. Roseli was able to start her business by putting 
together her life savings and money borrowed from a bank at 
6-8% interest per month (the interest rate has been 
steadily dropping and she refinances accordingly).  She 
explained that her bank has no line of credit for small 
businesses so it was necessary to take out personal loans. 
She has a partner who invested a small amount and 
contributes his time; he will receive no salary until the 
business becomes profitable. 
 
5. In order to start a food business in Brazil it is 
necessary to get three licenses: one federal, one state and 
one city.  It took about four months to complete the 
process.  Roseli hired a \"despachante\" (rough translation: 
legal agent) to do all the paperwork and legwork for her at 
a cost of 600 Reais (approximately USD200).  Technically, a 
food business should not commence operations before 
undergoing an ANVISA (Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia 
Sanitaria - Health Standards Agency) inspection.  Although 
an inspection was requested right away, it was a year 
before ANVISA agents showed up, and then only because of a 
complaint made against her by a customer. 
 
6. Roseli rented a storefront and set up an attractive 
establishment with a small dining area in the rear where 
walk-ins can eat.  She calls her business \"Gostinho 
Caseiro\" (Home Cooked Flavor).  A standard meal consists of 
rice, beans, meat, vegetable and dessert.  She works hard 
to vary the meals and make sure they are nutritionally 
sound and hygienically processed.  There are several 
competitors in the Sorocaba area.  All charge the same 
amount, but as the newcomer, Roseli feels she will be able 
to win over customers by providing better quality and 
variety. 
 
7. Roseli started her business in May 2003 delivering 100 
meals a day.  Volume grew to 200 meals by November, 2003, 
shrank over the holidays, then grew to 250 meals by March 
2004.  Roseli\'s original business plan called for expanding 
to at least 400 meals a day with current staffing.  She has 
come to the conclusion that she needs to hire a full-time 
sales person to achieve additional growth. 
 
8. The variable cost to produce meals is 2.20 Reals each, 
and they are sold to businesses at 3.80 - 4.20 Reals per 
meal depending on volume purchased.  In addition, walk-ins 
can buy standard prepackaged meals at 4.20 Reals or serve 
themselves at 10.20 Reals per kilo. 
 
Labor Woes 
----------- 
9. Staff consists of a receptionist/order taker who also 
supervises the kitchen staff, cook, and three assistants. 
Basic wage for the staff is determined by the union; R$430 
a month for regular staff and a little more for the cook. 
These amounts are increased annually based on inflation 
rates. 
 
10. Labor and personnel issues have been the most 
problematic for Roseli.  Brazilian labor laws favor the 
employee.  Even when an employee is terminated for cause, 
they can sue their employer through the union.  Roseli 
terminated an employee for cause after carefully 
documenting unexcused absences and paying her everything 
that was due.  The employee sued anyway, falsely saying 
that she was forced to work 12 hours a day while signing 
for 8 hours.  The judge awarded her an R$450 settlement; in 
addition, Roseli had to pay R$900 attorney costs. 
 
11. Hiring is also a problem.  First, Roseli tried hiring 
through an agency, but found their prescreening to be 
inadequate.  She then started hiring only through personal 
references.  Currently, she has someone on maternity leave, 
so she has to maintain the employee on the payroll and pay 
someone to take her place for four months.  INSS will 
reimburse Roseli the 4 months salary once the employee 
returns to work. 
 
Hard Times 
---------- 
12. Roseli had hoped to work full time in Sorocaba managing 
and growing her business, but after just six months, she 
was forced to return to a full-time job in Sao Paulo, 
traveling to Sorocaba on the weekends to manage her 
business.  She uses almost 100% of her Sao Paulo earnings 
to keep the business going. 
 
13. Due to a variety of reasons including personnel issues, 
utility costs, receivables, and lost business, she almost 
had to shut the business down, but managed to keep afloat 
by selling the van she owned outright and then leasing one 
and hiring the ubiquitous motorcycle delivery boys. 
 
Taxes, Taxes, Taxes 
------------------- 
14. As an MPE (Micro and Small Business) under the 
jurisdiction of SEBRAE (Brazilian Small Business 
Administration, a division of the Ministry of Development, 
Industry and Commerce) Roseli pays on a monthly basis: 
federal income taxes of 3-5% on sales, approximately R$400- 
450; IPTU (property tax) of R$161.00, additional city tax 
R$23.00 and car taxes of R$70.  An additional 8% of payroll 
goes to FGTS (Fundo de Garantia).  She deducts INSS monthly 
contributions from her employees\' salaries, but makes no 
additional contribution. 
 
15. Queried as to whether she ever considered running her 
business on an informal basis (i.e. unregistered and off 
the books - effectively, illegal), Roseli emphatically 
stated that it never crossed her mind.  She prefers to have 
a legitimate business with potential for growth that can be 
freely advertised to large reputable companies. 
 
16. Despite the mixed economic results to date (NOTE: 
during a period that coincided with Brazil\'s worst economic 
environment in recent memory. END NOTE), Roseli has no 
regrets, finds her venture very satisfying and spoke 
optimistically of the future. 
 
17. This cable was coordinated with Consulate General Sao 
Paulo.

SUBJECT:  ZERO SATISFACTION FROM GOB ON SODA-ASH TAX ISSUE 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) On August 18, Itamaraty officials presented us 
their official finding that the Rio state tax policy with 
regard to soda ash produced by local enterprise ALCALIS does 
not illegally discriminate against U.S. soda ash 
producers/exporters.  Our own scrutiny of the text of the 
2001 Rio State decree cited by the Brazilians as the base of 
their `finding\' makes their argument transparently 
inaccurate.  From our own tentative computations, it would 
seem the volume of potential U.S. soda-ash export sales 
affected may have been of the order of USD 20 million in 
2003, when U.S. sales to Rio were approximately eight 
million dollars out of gross U.S. export sales to Brazil of 
over forty million dollars (the rest being to states other 
than Rio).  Having regularly re-addressed the GoB on this 
concern in the more than two years since it first arose, 
only to arrive at such a GoB assertion now, Embassy has no 
expectation of achieving results via further approaches to 
Itamaraty.  Text of the Rio State decree in the original 
Portuguese and rough Embassy translation included in Paras 
10-11 below.  Para 9 contains data about the current status 
of Brazil\'s soda-ash market, including U.S. market share. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) On August 18, EconCouns, Trade Officer and DSCO met 
with Director-General of the Economic Department Minister 
Piragibe Tarrago and other Itamaraty (Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs) specialists again to discuss the soda-ash issue, 
among other subjects.  This was the fourth meeting Emboffs 
have held with senior-level Itamaraty interlocutors over the 
last year to request an official response to the USG concern 
that the Rio state ICMS tax treatment of domestic and 
imported soda ash involves a national-treatment breach under 
GATT Article III, in addition to occasions on which the 
issue has been raised by, e.g., visiting USDOC A/S Lash and 
D/USTR Allgeier. 
 
3.  (U) Minister Tarrago informed Emboffs that the MFA had 
definitively clarified the Rio ICMS issue in meetings with 
CAMEX and the Rio State Finance Ministry.  He asserted 
categorically that Rio state taxes both domestically- 
produced and imported soda ash at the same ICMS rate, 
currently 19%.  Tarrago proceeded to note that under the 
ICMS tax regime purchasers of a product may request a rebate 
or credit of the ICMS paid on the input (e.g., soda ash), 
from the state tax authority upon sale of their final 
product; this credit/rebate is likewise available regardless 
of whether the soda ash is imported or domestic.  Pressed on 
how it might be documented that ALCALIS in fact is subject 
to, and pays, the same 19% ICMS on its production as U.S. 
soda-ash exporters on their sales, he noted that ALCALIS is 
entitled to consider its financial-transaction data 
proprietary and not divulge it, but he remarked that the 
fact could likely be verified by contacting local soda-ash 
customers. 
 
4.  (U) Tarrago went on to suggest that confusion over the 
soda-ash ICMS status might have arisen because of the fact 
that Rio state allows ALCALIS the option of paying a flat 2% 
tax rate on its gross revenue.  This is totally separate 
from ICMS tax-regime considerations, he told us.  The basis 
for Rio allowing this option is that ALCALIS produces salt, 
an item within the Brazilian \"cesta basica (basic basket)\" 
of fundamental food items.  Under Rio state rules, 
allegedly, companies that produce any such items, as whole 
or part of their production, may choose either to have their 
gross revenue taxed at a flat 2% rate, or submit themselves 
to a normal state corporate tax regime, which, depending on 
various credits or rebates may or may not result in a higher 
taxation rate. 
 
5. (U) Thus, the soda-ash tax issue essentially is a 
domestic-tax-regime matter, concluded Tarrago.  The 
specifics are outlined in Rio State Decree 28104 of April 
13, 2001, articles 36-38, and 40.  Tarrago also singled out 
Article 40 of this decree as containing, in his words 
(seconded by one of the Itamaraty specialists also present) 
a general statement that it shall not affect the general 
application of the tax regime, guaranteeing equal 
application of the ICMS tax for domestic producers and 
importers. 
 
6. (SBU) The Brazilians did not have the text of the 2001 
Rio decree at hand; we thus could not go over it jointly at 
the August 18 meeting.  We ourselves have since re- 
scrutinized the same elements of the decree\'s text cited by 
the Brazilians as the basis of their finding.  That text 
does not in reality give any basis for the latter.  Totally 
the contrary, and unambiguously so, we judge:  the evidence 
prima facie does point to a national-treatment issue.  In 
particular: 
 
-- The decree does deal directly with the ICMS regime; the 
2% tax rate is not at all an unrelated, separate tax issue. 
 
-- The 2% tax rate on gross revenue (\"receita bruta 
auferida\") for all operations is indeed offered as an 
alternative to paying the regular 19% ICMS; and this 
alternative is made available to companies which refine salt 
for consumption and, very specifically, producers of soda 
ash that also market salt (Article 38), but not to the 
importer of U.S. soda ash. 
 
-- Article 40, which the Brazilians cited as proving that 
the regular application of the ICMS is not affected, 
actually seems to require only that the fiscal documents of 
taxpayers under this special regime must continue to conform 
to normal ICMS regulations.  It does not state or mean that 
the 19% ICMS tax rate continues to apply. 
 
-- Indeed, Article 42 appears to assume that covered 
taxpayers will use the 2% of gross revenue tax, not the 19% 
ICMS.  They actually have to request an opt-out from the 
State NOT to do so.  Whether particular companies choose to 
opt-out or not, presumably this different tax regime is at 
times beneficial -- i.e., gives the option to pay less tax 
than under a 19% ICMS. 
 
7.  (SBU) Embassy Trade Officer subsequently presented these 
considerations over lunch with Tarrago\'s Market Access 
Division subordinate Maria Elisa Maia and her deputy, Felipe 
Bandeira de Mello.  The latter made three defenses of the 
special tax regime.  First, they argued that since use of 
the 2% tax regime is optional, it does not necessarily 
contravene GATT Article III, and further, it is an open 
question as to whether or not the company has actually used 
the special regime to lower its tax liability.  We counter- 
argued that, whether or not the company has taken advantage 
of the special regime, providing an opportunity to 
preferentially lower the domestic company\'s tax liability 
could be inconsistent with Article III. 
 
8.  (SBU) Second, the Brazilians claimed that statistics 
showing stable then increasing U.S. exports of soda ash to 
the State of Rio since 2001 confirms that U.S. exporters 
were not prejudiced.  We argued that this is inconclusive, 
since U.S. exports theoretically could have reached higher 
levels still except for the domestic producer\'s potentially 
enhanced competitiveness due to the tax break.  Finally, the 
Brazilians opined that, even if the domestic producer 
lowered its tax liability using the special regime, the 
stable market shares for the domestic producer and the 
importer in the sale of soda ash in Brazil since 2001 
illustrates that the importer has not been prejudiced, since 
the domestic producer appears not to have lowered its price 
to gain market share.  We rejoined that what the domestic 
producer chooses to do with the tax windfall - increase 
profit or lower prices - is immaterial. 
 
9.  (SBU) Mission\'s research and input from FCS Rio industry 
contacts indicates the following as to the current state of 
Brazil\'s soda-ash market.  According to ANSAC\'s Rio-based 
agent, with whom FCS Rio met on May 24, the total Brazilian 
market for soda ash is 650,000 Metric Tons/Year.  ALCALIS, 
the Brazilian producer, produces 165,000 MT/Y or 25%.  The 
balance of Brazil\'s needs is imported from: 
 
-- ANSAC (U.S.): 300,000 MT/Y. This means ANSAC has 45% of 
the Brazilian market and is responsible for 70% of all 
Brazilian imports of soda ash. 
 
-- SOLVAY (Belgium): 130,000 MT or 20% of Brazil\'s imports. 
The ANSAC Rio agent noted to us that SOLVAY, although a 
Belgian group, has plants in the U.S. and is a member of 
ANSAC. 
 
-- CHINA: 65,000, or 10% of the Brazilian market. 
 
Preliminary Embassy research of Brazilian government trade 
figures indicates the following with regard to U.S. soda-ash 
sales to Brazil: 
 
-- U.S. exporters\' market share has been stable since 1999: 
64%, 64%, 60%, 65% in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, respectively. 
For the January-July period the figures for 2003 and 2004 
were 67% and 66%. 
 
-- The percentage of Brazil\'s total soda-ash imports that 
are bought in Rio state has been constant at roughly one- 
fifth since 1998, although for January-June in 2004 the 
ratio dropped to 14%, compared to 16% for the same period in 
2003. 
 
-- U.S. exporters\' market share in the Rio state local 
market has been 97% to 99% for every year since 1998, but 
the January-June figure for 2004 indicates a drop, to 81.6% 
compared to 96% for the same period in 2003. 
 
COMMENT:  Apparently some two-thirds of Brazil\'s total soda- 
ash market is outside Rio state, mainly in Sao Paulo.  The 
U.S. exporter has had a long-term monopoly of export sales 
into Rio state, something over 60,000 tons in 2003, 
according to the GoB figures.  This compares to the ALCALIS 
production there of 165,000 tons, with Chinese and Belgian 
competitors evidently not even on the scene.  We do not know 
if ALCALIS\'s entire production is sold and consumed in Rio 
state itself, as seems logical, or if some is sold to 
customers in other Brazilian states.  In any case, depending 
on the degree of advantage the Rio 2% tax favor gives 
ALCALIS in selling its output, it would seem that sales of 
up to that entire output could theoretically be affected. 
END COMMENT. 
 
ALCALIS (located in Arraial do Cabo municipality about three 
hours east of Rio de Janeiro city that is said to have 
gained independent administrative status solely because of 
the presence of the mega-plant itself), currently has a 
reported 700 employees, down from the two-thousand range in 
the past.  It is said to be facing irredeemable problems, 
including the failure of its buyers when it was privatized 
in the mid-1990s to be current with their payments, and 
environmental issues.

ON THE INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES OF REFINING SALT FOR 
CONSUMPTION AND OF PRODUCING SODA ASH 
 
\"Art. 36. The ICMS taxpayer that exercises exclusively the 
industrial activity of refining salt for consumption, 
classified un the subgroup denominated by \"refining of salt 
for consumption,\" code 4.24.12.05-8, of the Catalog of

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT CHISSANO VISITS BRAZIL 
 
REF: A. BRASILIA 796 
     B. BRASILIA 1975 
 
Classified By: DepPolCouns Lawrence Cohen, reasons 1.4 (b & d) 
 
1. ()  Summary:  Mozambique President Chissano visited Brazil 
on August 31 and was rewarded with over USD 315 million in 
debt forgiveness for his country, the most relief Brazil has 
given during President Lula\'s administration.  Chissano is 
well regarded in Brazil, and his decision to step down has 
generated some angst here.  President Lula, meanwhile, is 
showing that his Africa-oriented foreign policy is no fluke. 
End Summary 
 
Worth the Trip to Brazil.... 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (U)  During Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano\'s August 
31 visit to Brasilia, the Brazilian Government (GOB) 
announced it would write off 95% of Mozambique\'s official 
debt (USD 315.1 million) with the balance (USD 16.6 million) 
to be converted into investment or equity funds.  The accord 
was signed by Brazilian Finance Minister Antonio Palocci and 
President Chissano.  The GOB also confirmed it would finance 
the installation in Mozambique of a pharmaceutical plant for 
manufacture of anti-retrovirus medicine.  In forgiving 
Mozambique\'s debt, President Lula stated that Brazil was 
setting an example for other countries.  Minister Palocci 
emphasized that Brazil\'s initiative followed guidelines set 
by the Paris Club to assist Mozambique and would not have any 
impact on Brazil\'s own financial situation.  (Note: The Chief 
of the Foreign Ministry\'s Africa II Division told poloff that 
Mozambique has been current on its debt obligations to 
Brazil. End Note) 
 
3. (SBU) Debt relief for Mozambique follows closely President 
Lula\'s announcements regarding Bolivia (where during a July 
visit he announced debt relief of USD 48.7 million of 
Bolivia\'s USD 52 million debt), Gabon (USD 36 million of debt 
to be renegotiated), and Cape Verde (promised debt 
forgiveness of USD 2.7 million).  According to press reports, 
the GOB is also analyzing possible debt relief for El 
Salvador. 
 
Polemics Aside... 
----------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) In public remarks referring to visiting President 
Chissano, who has ruled Mozambique for 18 years, Lula 
expressed regret that Chissano had decided not to run for 
reelection in December. The Brazilian President went on to 
praise President Chissano: \"You have learned to appreciate, 
as few have, the symbolism and real value of the exercise of 
democracy.\" (Comment: Chissano is very popular in Brazil and 
enjoys close friendships with senior Brazilian officials such 
as former President Jose Sarney.  End Comment) 
 
5.  (U) Chissano spoke to diplomats and new Brazilian foreign 
service officers at the prestigious Rio Branco Institute (the 
GOB equivalent of the Foreign Service Institute) about 
conflict resolution in Africa.  He elaborated on two key 
themes: Africans must stop blaming their colonial past for 
the continent\'s present problems, and Africans must utilize 
African solutions to resolve conflict and not depend on the 
United Nations or others.  Moreover, he said each conflict 
had its own roots and unique characteristics which must be 
addressed. His most pointed comments in response to a 
question dealt with Zimbabwe.  While not praising President 
Mugabe, Chissano made clear that, given the history, Mugabe 
and Zimbabwe were essentially the same and could not be 
separated, and constant dialogue among all the parties was 
the only way to relieve the country\'s internal pressures. 
 
Comment 
------- 
6.  (C) During the last few months, President Lula has been 
putting some substance into what initially appeared a hollow 
Africa policy.  At the upcoming September heads of state 
meeting at the UN to discuss the creation of a world fund to 
combat poverty, Lula will likely refer 
to his government\'s efforts to help Africa, including some 
on-going and planned initiatives with India and South Africa. 
During Chissano\'s visit, President Lula vowed that he would 
go to Africa every year, and we sense he will meet this 
promise.  Foreign Ministry contacts tell us that west Africa, 
probably Nigeria and Guinea Bissau and possibly Ghana and 
Senegal, could expect Lula\'s next African foray. 
 
7.  (C) However, when looking across the Atlantic, President 
Lula ought to select his itinerary and message carefully. 
His July visit to Gabon, his ride there in an open Rolls 
Royce with Gabonese President Bongo, and a subsequent bad 
joke by Lula that he\'d visited Gabon to learn how to stay in 
power 37 years earned the President some ridicule here (ref 
B).

SUBJECT: GSP/IPR: BRAZIL\'S EMERGING INITIATIVES 
 
REF: (A) BRASILIA 2150 (B) BRASILIA 2017 
 
1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY 
 
2.  (U) The announcement on June 30, 2004 to extend review of 
the possible withdrawal of trade benefits from Brazil under 
the Generalized System of Preferences, and the closing of the 
Congressional Investigative Commission (CPI) on Piracy on 
August 11 (ref a) have heightened public debate and led to 
work on new GoB initiatives to combat piracy.  Below provides 
an overview.  While some of the initiatives are not fully 
formed, the information provides some sense of the direction 
in which the GoB is moving; details are expected to be 
revealed during the second meeting of the bilateral IPR 
Working Group September 9-10 in Washington (ref b). 
 
National Council for the Defense of Intellectual Property and 
the Fight Against Piracy 
 
3. (U) In a formal ceremony on August 12, Deputy Medeiros led 
the CPI on Piracy in presenting the Commission\'s final report 
to President Lula, who was flanked by Minister of Political 
Coordination, Aldo Rebelo, and Minister of Justice Marcio 
Bastos.  President Lula did not speak, but Minister Bastos 
used the occasion to announce the first of the GoB 
initiatives flowing from the CPI report, formation of a 
public-private sector National Council for the Defense of 
Intellectual Property and for the Fight Against Piracy. 
Deputy Medeiros has reportedly been working closely with the 
private sector and the Ministry of Justice on drafting the 
decree to establish the Council.   (Note: During an 
Information Technology forum in Sao Paulo August 10, a 
private sector contact told Consulate Econoff of the upcoming 
announcement and claimed the GoB was expediting establishment 
of the Council out of concern over the potential loss of GSP 
trade benefits.)  See para 16 for an unofficial Embassy 
translation of the decree\'s initial draft. 
 
4. (SBU) Although the decree is not yet final, Ambassador 
Portella, Bastos\'s International Advisor, told Econoff in a 
meeting on August 23 he expected President Lula to sign it by 
the September 9-10 IPR Working Group meeting.  He said the 
final decree would not vary greatly in substance from the 
initial draft, the main hold-up being related to a mechanism 
for selecting private sector participants.  According to 
Portella, the new Council represents a significant 
improvement over the ineffectual Inter-ministerial Committee 
on Piracy, which will be dissolved with the Council\'s 
formation.  He claimed that to ensure clout, the rank of 
council members would be significantly higher, probably from 
within the first or second rung below minister; Committee 
members hailed only from the working-level. 
 
5. (SBU) In contrast to the Committee\'s many-paged, vague 
workplan, Portella also said the Council\'s work will be much 
more focused.  The decree directs the Council specifically 
to: elaborate a national policy for defending intellectual 
piracy and fighting piracy; create and maintain a national 
database, integrated into the Unified Public Security System 
for better coordinating enforcement at the federal, state and 
local levels; and propose specific enforcement actions, 
including special operations and investigations, and 
mechanisms for more effectively combating piracy.  He also 
noted private sector participation within the Council as an 
improvement; the draft decree provided for three civil 
society representatives, but private sector has been lobbying 
the Ministry to increase the number of seats to five.  (Note: 
At Deputy Medeiros\' urging, on August 30, representatives of 
copyright industries -- audiovisual, music, software, books 
and the Institute for Ethical Competition -- formed the 
Permanent Forum of Entities in Defense of Intellectual 
Property, Combat of Piracy, Contraband, and Tax Evasion, 
which they hope will be the forum for selecting the private 
sector representatives to participate in the Council.) 
 
Mercosul Coordination 
 
6. (SBU) During the first IPR Working Group meeting in Rio de 
Janeiro August 5, GoB officials asserted that domestic action 
alone could not curb piracy given the magnitude of contraband 
flowing into Brazil from its neighbors (ref b).  At that 
time, they noted GoB plans to press for regional action by 
interjecting discussions on piracy into Mercosul 
deliberations during Brazil\'s time as the group\'s president 
pro tempore.  Following though on this, piracy and the search 
for collaborative efforts to address the problem region-wide 
are being discussed as part of a Mercosul (plus Associate 
Members) meeting September 1-3 in Manaus, Brazil of officials 
from Interior and Justice Ministries and Customs services. 
The group is charged with developing concrete actions for 
approval during a Ministerial slated to take place November 
19 in Brasilia. 
 
Paraguay 
 
7. (SBU) Cooperation within Mercosul will probably focus on 
bilateral projects with Paraguay.  According to Ernani 
Checcucci, Coordinator General of the Customs Administration 
within the Ministry of Finance, there have been bilateral 
initiatives in the past, but that effort is being stepped-up. 
 The GoB is considering changes to the \"free customs transit\" 
which provides inspection-free transit for containers passing 
through Brazilian territory from the Brazilian Port of 
Paranagua to the Paraguayan border.  Initially agreed to 
provide port access to Paraguayan exporters, this open 
channel has turned into a major corridor for merchandise 
moving into Paraguay for future smuggling into Brazil via the 
mass movement of trucks, buses and motorcycles over the 
Friendship Bridge linking Ciudad del Este in (P) and Foz do 
Iguacu (B).  Portella noted that the volume of virgin CDs 
moving through this corridor far exceeds Paraguayan 
consumption, leading the GoB to conclude that they are 
destined for illegal transport into Brazil. 
 
8. (SBU) On August 26, during a visit to Brasilia of 
Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte, President Lula directed 
his economic team to within 30 days find a formula for 
financially assisting Paraguay to the tune of $25 million to 
$55 million for social dislocation (unemployment) associated 
with bilateral projects for fighting piracy.  In an August 30 
conversation with Econoff, Checcucci said the GoB is 
cognizant of the potentially explosive social reaction in 
Ciudad del Este should there be an immediate, severe clamp 
down on piracy and smuggling.  He explained that the GoB\'s 
goal is to work with Paraguay to \"formalize\" the Ciudad del 
Este economy, moving people away from smuggling toward legal 
commerce. 
 
Customs 
 
9. (U) Brazil\'s Customs service has an array of projects 
underway to improve its ability to control commerce moving 
across the border.  These have principally been prompted by 
USG security requirements post-9/11 and by GoB interest in 
improving the collection of import duties, but many serve 
anti-piracy interests as well.   According to Checcucci, the 
initiatives can be grouped roughly into three categories: (1) 
combat contraband, smuggling, and piracy; (2) regularize the 
assessment of duties and combat trade fraud; and (3) 
negotiate international customs assistance and cooperation 
agreements.  For some of these initiatives, customs is still 
in the process of securing a GoB budgetary commitment, and in 
cases involving organizational changes, approval of the 
Planning Ministry.  Below is a sketch of the specific Customs 
initiatives and their expected timelines within each category. 
 
1. Combat contraband, smuggling, and piracy 
1) Establishment of a National Plan for Customs Security 
(2004-2007); 
2) Establishment of a computerized system for declarations 
and movement of cargo (Siscomex for Ports) (2004-2005) 
(enhances 1997 Siscomex trade flow registration system); 
3) Establishment of a Computerized System for Control of 
International Passengers (2004); 
4) Restructuring of physical facilities, automation of 
transit controls, and separation of traffic across the 
International Friendship Bridge (Foz do Iguacu-Ciudad del 
Este (2005-2006); 
5) Creation of specialized enforcement customs units. (These 
specialized units would operate in the interior of the 
country; customs already has the authority to seize goods 
smuggled into the country.) 
 
2. Regularize the assessment of duties and combating trade 
fraud 
1) Creating Program for Fiscal Regularization: sets up a 
system whereby established trade operators may register with 
the service and once establishing legitimacy become eligible 
for a speedier customs clearance process (enabling Customs to 
focus efforts on more questionable movements) ; 
2) Establishment of a computerized system for risk assessment 
and inspection selection (2004); incorporation of artificial 
intelligence software into the computerized system to enhance 
its operation (2005-2007); 
3) Taking customs documents on-line (2004-2006); 
4) Second phase of Siscomex integration with the addition of 
information from state finance authorities (2005); 
5) Combat against customs fraud: registration of foreign 
suppliers (electronic invoices); establish process for 
official investigation on import valuation -- requires 
legislation (2004-2005). 
 
3. Negotiate international customs assistance and cooperation 
agreements 
1) Conclusion of bilateral customs agreements (2004-2007). 
Target countries: China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
India, Italy, Germany, Israel and Bolivia. 
2) Integration of other countries\' electronic customs systems 
into Siscomex:  Phase I (tests): Argentina and Paraguay; 
Phase II: Other South American countries (2004-2007); 
Phase III: Others. 
 
10. (U) To justify the expenditure of additional resources 
for its initiatives, Customs claims these projects will 
result in substantial savings for the government.  They 
estimate that the first activity (combating contraband, 
smuggling and piracy) would yield an annual rate of return of 
490 percent; the second (regularizing the assessment of 
duties and combating trade fraud), would yield an even higher 
rate of return of 2,854 percent. 
 
Agreement with Interpol 
 
11. (SBU) Following a presentation by John Newton of 
Interpol\'s IP Crime Unit during the Brazilian Intellectual 
Property Association\'s (ABPI) 24th National Seminar August 
18-19 in Brasilia, a private sector contact informed Econoff 
that the Ministry of Justice was working to form an agreement 
with Interpol for greater cooperation on piracy, including 
the stationing of a Federal Police officer in Lyon.  However, 
on August 23, Ambassador Portella could not confirm this. 
Public Debate 
12. (SBU) Less than a week after the CPI on Piracy concluded 
its work and presented a final report to President Lula, the 
ABPI hosted its two-day National Seminar on Intellectual 
Property.  With over 550 participants representing some 26 
countries, the seminar was a major platform for private 
sector and government debate.  What was striking was the 
consistent message from presenters -- for Brazil to attain 
its economic development goals, as a government and as a 
society it must protect intellectual property.  Broadly 
speaking, there were two elements to the argument: (1) 
sustainable economic development will to a large extent 
depend on creativity and technological innovation, which in 
turn requires a system in which intellectual property rights 
are assured; and (2) the economic informality and the 
pervasive crime, both street and organized, associated with 
piracy endangers the country\'s economic base and foundation 
on the rule of law, creating an untenable basis for economic 
development. 
 
Government Reaction 
 
13. (SBU) A notable exception was the more defensive posture 
presented by Brazil\'s Ambassador to Geneva Luiz Felipe de 
Seixas Correa and the Foreign Ministry\'s Director for 
International Trade Negotiations Ambassador Regis Arslanian; 
both said IPR interests  principally belong to developed 
countries.  Seixas Correa for instance stated categorically 
that TRIPs had hurt developing countries, although he quickly 
added that Brazil is not seeking to secede from the 
Agreement.  Arslanian portrayed IPR as one, if not the, 
stumbling block in Mercosul negotiations with the EU and 
United States.  In particular, he complained that the EU and 
U.S. are unreasonably pressing resource-strapped Mercosul to 
commit to a 100 percent enforcement rate.  Interestingly, 
neither mentioned the GSP/IPR review. 
 
14.  (SBU) Certain private sector contacts have also noted 
that their Ministry of Justice and Customs interlocutors are 
displaying much more interest and earnestness in discussing 
new initiatives for combating piracy than the Foreign 
Ministry, the one responsible for compliance with 
international obligations.  It may be that the former 
institutions welcome the focus that the CPI report, and even 
the GSP review, provide to the issue, helping them justify 
additional resources and gain political backing for 
undertakings they independently deem as important, whether it 
is improved duty collection or tools for better fighting 
organized crime. 
 
15. (SBU) Despite institutional wariness on the subject, the 
Foreign Ministry members of the IPR Working Group have by all 
accounts been diligently assembling what they view as a 
comprehensive report of GoB efforts to combat piracy, which 
they will present during the September 9-10 meetings in 
Washington.  This report, which is being translated into 
English, will focus on activities over the last year.  In a 
converstaion with Econoff September 3, Otavio Brandelli and 
Henrique Moraes of the Ministry\'s IPR Division said there is 
some concern that the Council decree will not be final by the 
meeting date, raising a question about whether or not they 
will provide the written text at that time or later, once 
information on the decree is available.  In any case, they 
plan to present whatever information is currently available.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PRESENTS CREDENTIALS TO PRESIDENT LULA 
DA SILVA, 2 SEPTEMBER 2004 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN J. DANILOVICH. REASONS: 1.4 
(B)(D). 
 
1.  (U)  Ambassador formally presented his credentials to 
President Lula da Silva in a ceremony at the Planalto Palace 
in the afternoon of 2 September 2004.  As per Brazilian 
protocol custom, Ambassador was one of three chiefs of 
mission presenting credentials to the president (the 
Venezuelan ambassador proceeded and the Hungarian came 
after), with each ambassador meeting with the president 
separately and then, in turn, inspecting troops and hearing 
national anthems on the ramp of the palace\'s main entrance. 
 
2. (SBU) On receiving Ambassador Danilovich and a delegation 
of senior mission officers, Lula welcomed the Ambassador to 
Brazil and launched immediately into a friendly question and 
answer session on the status of the U.S. presidential 
campaign.  Ambassador explained the historical function of 
the conventions, noting that in modern times they have become 
pro forma \"coronations,\" but in the past they were actual 
venues for candidate selection.  Lula mused that Brazil\'s 
party conventions are also pro forma, but last a maximum of a 
single day.  Lula then asked which states would be decisive 
in terms of votes.  Ambassador discussed the battlefield 
states and also the general importance of his home state of 
California.  He invited the president to visit California, 
meet with the governor and California companies with 
technological, agricultural and commercial interests in 
Brazil, and address Stanford University. 
 
3. (U) Turning to the upcoming UNGA and the 20 September 
conference in New York on international hunger initiatives 
hosted by Brazil, Lula said Brazil is expecting over fifty 
heads of state to participate.  He asked about U.S. 
representation, and whether Secretary Powell would attend the 
UNGA.  Ambassador Danilovich explained that President Bush 
would be formally represented by a presidential envoy, 
Agriculture Secretary Veneman, who would be prepared to read 
a message from the President. 
 
4. (U)  Lula turned to the subject of Brazil\'s economy, 
voicing his satisfaction at the positive indicators on growth 
coming in over recent weeks.  Lula outlined the history of 
boom-bust economic recovery plans in Brazil over the past 
twenty years, and said his mission is to establish a 
sustained and rational growth dynamic that will be the basis 
for a realistic and healthy economic model for Brazil over 
the long term. 
 
5. (C)  In a pull aside with Ambassador Danilovich at the 
meeting\'s conclusion, Lula noted that he had always been 
treated with respect and kindness by President Bush, for 
which Lula warmly expressed his gratitude. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  President Lula was friendly, animated and 
relaxed, taking 15 minutes to converse with the Ambassador in 
an event that often lasts only the time needed for 
pleasantries and handshakes.  He used the meeting to register 
a message about his intention to stay the course in an 
economic policy he feels is being vindicated, and to make 
clear that he is seeking the highest possible level of USG 
representation at the Brazil-sponsored hunger conference in 
New York.  It is evident that Lula feels strongly about the 
subject of the conference and also has his personal and 
international prestige linked to the event. In that sense he 
may be concerned about a USG presence that may appear to him 
as limited in the context of a heads of state meeting on 
American soil.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S CALL ON DEFENSE MINISTER VIEGAS, 8 
SEPTEMBER 2004 
 
REF: BRASILIA 2293 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN J. DANILOVICH. REASONS: 1.4(B)(D). 
 
1. (C) Summary. In a courtesy call on 8 September with 
Ambassador, Defense Minister Jose Viegas expressed 
enthusiastic satisfaction with Department responses to GOB 
suggestions for revisions in the stalled 2000 bilateral 
Technology Safeguards Agreement on possible U.S. 
participation in commercial space launches at Brazil\'s 
Alcantara facility.  Viegas believes the governments are 
close to consensus on a revised text. Viegas was also 
grateful and optimistic regarding successful conclusion of a 
bilateral understanding on Brazil\'s lethal force air bridge 
denial program.  Viegas opined that it could take Brazil 
\"some years\" to work through issues and sign onto the IAEA 
Additional Protocol on non-proliferation safeguards (a view 
not/not reinforced by FM Amorim in later conversation with 
the Ambassador, per reftel; Department please see also action 
request on this issue in para 8).  Viegas also said he 
expects President Lula da Silva to announce a decision in 
Brazil\'s  new fighter acquisition program in a few weeks\' 
time.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Viegas greeted Ambassador warmly in a small meeting in 
the minister\'s office (Viegas was accompanied by one senior 
advisor, Ambassador by POL Counselor) and directly embarked 
on a review of the following issues: 
 
Alcantara Technology Safeguards Agreement: 
 
3. (C) Viegas said that he is \"delighted\" with the content of 
a USG nonpaper providing the Department\'s reactions to 
GOB-proposed revisions in the Alcantara TSA (signed by both 
governments in 2000 to facilitate U.S. firms\' participation 
in commercial space launches from Brazil\'s Alcantara facility 
but stalled in ratification in Brazil\'s congress owing to 
concerns the accord impinges on Brazilian \"sovereignty\"). 
Viegas said the two remaining areas of difference between the 
governments as reflected in the nonpaper -- relating to 
access for USG personnel to accident sites and the need for 
conclusion of TSA\'s by Brazil with other users of the 
facility -- appear to him to be easily resolvable.  Viegas 
said he would the USG nonpaper to Brazilian experts and 
informally approach contacts in congress to assure a 
favorable environment when a revised text is resubmitted for 
ratification.  Viegas expressed his deep appreciation for USG 
willingness to revisit the Alcantara issue, calling it an 
\"important symbol\" of good will toward Brazil on the USG\'s 
part.  Viegas also reiterated that the GOB will join the 
International Code of Conduct on Ballistic Missiles (ICOC), 
which has been the main USG request to the GOB in the context 
of re-opening the TSA text for revisions. 
 
\"Shootdown\" Issue 
 
4. (C) Viegas said his staff would provide the USG asap with 
its final input to the draft texts for diplomatic notes and 
addenda that will serve as the basis for memorializing the 
governments\' mutual understanding of Brazil\'s lethal force 
interdiction program for aerial narcotrafficking, scheduled 
for implementation in October. Viegas implied that the MOD 
was prepared to accept virtually all of the USG\'s recommended 
final revisions to the texts. (Note: Viegas\' staff provided 
the comments to Pol Counselor on 10 September, which were 
forwarded to Department WHA/BSC via email on the same date. 
End note.)  Ambassador and Pol Counselor noted that the 
Department is preparing the Memorandum of Justification (MOJ) 
 recommending a Presidential Determination waiving liability 
under U.S. law as related to Brazil\'s program.  The formal 
exchange of the diplomatic notes will be the final bilateral 
step before the MOJ is sent to the President for decision, 
they added. 
 
Additional Protocol 
 
5. (C) The minister then raised the question of Brazil\'s 
adhering to the Additional Protocol to the NPT.  Viegas said 
that the GOB would likely sign on to the AP, but that the 
process of deliberation could require \"some years.\" 
Ambassador voiced surprise that a decision could take so 
long.  Viegas elaborated that Brazil occupies a unique 
\"niche\" among suppliers in terms of its technological 
development, which it wants to protect while still finding 
ways to cooperate with inspection.  He also said that any 
suggestion that Brazil belongs in the same company as North 
Korea and Iran is anathema for the GOB, given Brazil\'s strong 
non-proliferation credential.  Ambassador rejoined that it is 
just those exemplary credentials which make Brazil an 
important  model for others.  Viegas replied that Brazil 
deserves to be granted patience and consideration as it works 
through decisions on the AP.  (Comment:  Viegas\' assertion 
that it could require years for Brazil to sign the AP was 
not/not echoed in a subsequent meeting between Ambassador and 
Foreign Minister Amorim, per reftel.  Amorim said Brazil 
needed to work through a number of issues regarding the AP, 
but he seemed surprised when Ambassador noted Viegas\'s 
comment, and did not affirm it as a GOB position. End 
comment.) 
 
FX Program 
 
6. (C) Responding to a query from Ambassador on the status of 
Brazil\'s F-X new fighter selection competition, Viegas said 
that the MOD has completed its technical evaluation and 
referred the decision to the President.  Viegas said that 
Presidency Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu had told Viegas to 
expect a decision \"soon,\"  and Viegas opined the decision 
could be announced \"in a few weeks.\"  Viegas did not offer 
further comment, except to note that the Lockheed Martin 
offer for the F-16 Block 50 was regarded by some in the 
Brazilian Air Force as \"lacking\" in its offset proposals, and 
also there remained a question of \"the weapons not following 
the plane\"  -- an apparent allusion to continuing questions 
in the BRAF about the availability of the AMRAAM BVR missile 
system.  When POL Counselor noted to Viegas that the USG had 
fully cleared sale of the AMRAAM to Brazil two years ago, 
Viegas seemed puzzled and asked that POL Counselor contact 
the Brazilian air force to discuss the issue. 
 
South America 
 
7.  (C) In closing, Viegas noted that the GOB\'s guiding 
strategic interest in South America is \"stability.\" He 
assured Ambassador that all GOB regional military policies -- 
whether bilateral information sharing initiatives with 
neighboring countries or possible defense-industrial 
cooperation projects -- were intended to promote stability, 
and this should be seen as complementary of, not competitive 
with, USG policies.  Ambassador replied that Brazilian 
leadership in regional security initiatives is welcomed and 
encouraged in Washington. 
 
8. (C) Comment. Viegas was upbeat, speaking gratefully and 
enthusiastically about bilateral progress on both the 
Alcantara agreement and the shootdown issue.  Clearly he 
views both of these as close to successful resolutions -- 
welcome developments for the GOB and feathers in Viegas\' own 
cap.  His remarks on the Additional Protocol and the FX 
program are, on the other hand, puzzling.  On the AP, the 
impression is that Viegas does not entirely master the issue 
(e.g., he seems to mix in his mind the questions of AP 
adherence and Brazil\'s ongoing negotiations with the IAEA for 
inspections at Brazil\'s Rezende facility which, while 
thematically related, are technically separate questions). 
Hence we would be cautious about taking his comments as 
definitive GOB positions, and are inclined to believe that FM 
Amorim\'s views, as  expressed in reftel, are more 
authoritative.  Action request: Given the current lack of 
precision and clarity on Brazil\'s official position on the AP 
issue, we will continue to query senior GOB officials about 
the evolution of their views at every opportunity.  We also 
ask that Department engage with Ambassador Abdenur regarding 
Brazil\'s position. 
 
9. (C) Comment continued.  On the FX and AMRAAM, it is 
bewildering to us that, at this late stage, the minister of 
defense does not understand from his air force that the 
AMRAAM system has been approved for Brazil for some time.  We 
intend to explore this quietly with air force contacts.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES BILATERAL TRADE ISSUES WITH 
MINISTER OF DEVELOPMENT, COMMERCE, AND FOREIGN TRADE 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  During a September 10 courtesy call by the Ambassador on Luiz Furlan, Minister of Development, Commerce and Foreign Trade (MDIC), the latter pressed for greater progress on bilateral issues and a sharper focus on finding ways to increase Brazilian exports to the U.S.  In particular, Furlan underscored the importance of Brazil\'s \"small but sensitive\" shrimp exports to the U.S., and hoped for a quick (and favorable) resolution by the U.S. Import Administration of the pending anti-dumping review.  Furlan spoke positively regarding recent draft proposals by USDOC for Informal Commercial Exchange (ICE) talks with Brazil, though he requested greater specificity and detail from the USG as to what such discussions might entail.  Finally, Furlan opined that notwithstanding press speculation that the EU-Mercosul FTA negotiations were at an impasse, his view was that progress on concluding an accord could be made in the short-term.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On September 10, the Ambassador paid his initial courtesy call on MDIC Luiz Furlan.  Vice Minister Marcio Fortes, Mario Mugnaini Jr. (Executive Secretary of the GOB\'s inter-agency Foreign Trade Committee), Fernando de Magalhaes Furlan (Chief of Staff), Jose Mauro da Couto (Special Advisor to the Minister), and Pompeu Andreucci Neto (Senior Advisor on Foreign Affairs) joined the meeting from the Brazilian side.  Econ Counselor accompanied the Ambassador. 
 
3. (SBU) During the 45-minute conversation, Furlan touched upon a wide variety of issues.  In particular, he made the following points: 
 
--  While Brazilian agricultural exports to Europe and Asia had registered substantial increases this year, U.S. import restrictions were making it difficult for Brazilian producers to export primary products to the U.S.   Some way needed to be found to focus on why exports to the U.S. are lagging given that Brazilian products are competitive in other markets. 
 
--   Despite press speculation that the E.U.-Mercosul FTA talks had hit an impasse, his view (which provoked gasps from some of his advisors) was that progress could be made in the short-term, with an agreement possible this fall.  (Note:  O Estado de Sao Paulo reported on September 13 that in an informal meeting with Foreign Minister Amorim, MDIC Furlan and Minister of Agriculture Rodriguez on Sunday, September 12, EU negotiator Pascal Lamy agreed to present the EU offer as a complete package during market access discussions slated for September 20 in Brussels.  Notwithstanding Furlan\'s optimism, he was quoted to the effect that \"much remains to be done.\"  Subsequently, the September 14 O Estado quoted Amb. Jose Graca Lima, the GOB representative to the EU as saying that he did not believe that an EU-Mercosul accord could be reached prior to the October 31 target date.) 
 
--  The GOB would continue with its policy of economic and political outreach to both developing countries and the developed world.  Brazil soon hoped to finalize its FTA with South Africa and the SADCC, and in the coming weeks world leaders such as Japanese PM Koizumi, Russian President Putin, PRC leader Hu Jintao, and Pakistani President Musharraf would come to Brasilia to discuss, inter alia, increasing economic ties. 
 
--  Preliminarily, the GOB looked with favor on USDOC\'s idea of Informal Commercial Exchanges (ICE) with Brazil.  However, Furlan felt that the concept needed to be further defined and requested that the USG \"concretizar\" its thoughts on this issue.  Comment.  It is likely that prior to proceeding, Furlan wants to make certain that any ICE talks do not intrude upon the ongoing Bilateral Consulative Mechanism, led(from the Brazilian side) by Itamaray.  End Comment. 
 
--  Finally, Furlan noted the importance of Brazil\'s fledgling shrimp export industry.  This \"small but sensitive\" sector, he said, was key to the economy of several of Brazil\'s poor northeastern states.  Furlan indicated that he hoped for a quick (and favorable) resolution by the U.S. Import Administration of the pending anti-dumping investigation. For his part, the Ambassador stated that the U.S. Import Administration\'s final determination is due in December.  The Ambassador noted that, as is USDOC\'s usual practice, the anti-dumping investigation would be conducted in a fair, transparent manner.

SUBJECT:  Japanese PM\'s Visit to Brazil 
 
 
1.(U) Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, on his 
first trip to Latin America, visited Brazil from September 
14-16.  Prime Minister Koizumi spent two days in Sao Paulo 
meeting with representatives from business, government, and 
the local Japanese-Brazilian community.  He then met in 
Braslia with Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da 
Silva. 
 
2.(U) Highlights of the Prime Minister\'s visit included: 
 
--(U) PM Koizumi\'s calls for stronger commercial 
cooperation between Japan and Latin America:  The Prime 
Minister cited the recently signed Japan-Mexico free trade 
agreement as an indication of Japan\'s commercial interest 
in the resource-rich region.  While rumors of a similar 
ilar 
bilateral trade agreement between Japan and Brazil 
circulated prior to and during the Prime Minister\'s visit, 
the only trade-related announcement involved the renewal of 
mango exports from Brazil to Japan. 
 
--(U) Koizumi\'s request for Brazil\'s support in pushing 
forward the Doha round of WTO negotiations.  The PM made 
the request in a speech before government and business 
leaders in Sao Paulo.  [Comment:  Brazil has proven itself 
a key player in marshalling developing countries against 
agricultural subsidies by the U.S., E.U., and Japan. 
Through its leadership in the G-20 and as one of the Five 
Interested Parties (FIPs), Brazil was instrumental in 
setting up an August 2004 agreement on a framework for 
future WTO negotiations.  End comment] 
 
--(U) An announcement, made jointly by PM Koizumi and 
President Lula, of mutual support for U.N. Security Council 
reform that would include permanent seats for both Brazil 
and Japan.  [Comment:  Both Japan, the whose contributions 
s 
to the U.N. are second only to those of the U.S., and 
Brazil, the largest and most populous country in Latin 
America, have been seeking permanent spots on the Security 
Council as recognition of their regional and global clout. 
End comment] 
 
--(U) In addition to seeing a first cousin who 
immigrated to Brazil in the 1950\'s, the Prime Minister 
stopped at the Museum of Japanese Immigration and met with 
ethnic community leaders in Sao Paulo.  Hearing the saga of 
the ethnic Japanese in Brazil, who currently number 
approximately 1.4. million, left the Prime Minister in 
tears.

ADVISOR MARCO AURELIO GARCIA, 17 SEPTEMBER 2004 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN J. DANILOVICH. REASONS: 1.4 
(B)(D). 
 
(C) 1. In a friendly and animated initial courtesy call by 
Ambassador on 17 September, President Lula da Silva\'s Senior 
Advisor on International Affairs, Marco Aurelio Garcia, 
reviewed a range of bilateral and international issues. 
Garcia observed that the bilateral relationship is positive 
and sound, characterized by efforts on both sides at \"mutual 
understanding\" and bolstered by the personal rapport between 
Presidents Bush and Lula.  Other high points of the 
discussion follow: 
 
REGIONAL ISSUES 
 
2. (C) Garcia affirmed his own role in stressing to Lula the 
centrality of South America to Brazil\'s foreign policy 
agenda.  Specifically, Garcia said GOB priorities in South 
America have included reinforcing Mercosul (which Garcia 
claimed had languished under the previous administration), 
building economic and political stability on the continent 
(Brazil\'s prominent presence in crisis management in 
Venezuela and Bolivia are examples of this effort), and 
strengthening relations with Chile.  Garcia further said that 
the GOB strategic toolbox for regional stabilization includes 
use of BNDES development bank funding for infrastructure 
projects, import substitution programs to increase Brazilian 
purchases from neighboring countries, and expansion of the 
investment presence in the region of major Brazilian 
industries, notably Petrobras. 
 
3. (C) The Ambassador asked for a readout of Lula\'s recent 
meeting in Manaus with Venezuelan President Chavez, and for 
Garcia\'s thoughts on the way forward in Venezuela in the wake 
of the referendum.  Garcia limited his response to the Manaus 
meeting, noting that its central importance was in refocusing 
attention on cooperation in the Amazon region, with new 
emphasis on the Amazon Treaty Organization, which is being 
re-energized and headquartered in Brasilia. 
 
NONPROLIFERATION 
 
4. (C) Ambassador raised the question of Brazilian adherence 
to the IAEA Additional Protocol.   He said that he believes 
the dialogue on nuclear issues between the GOB and IAEA will 
become \"calmer\" (\"mais tranquilo\") in coming months.  Garcia 
observed that Brazil\'s constitution of 1988 expressly 
prohibits national development of nuclear weapons; that 
Brazil\'s nuclear program is \"totally transparent\"; and that 
Brazil\'s regional and international non-proliferation 
credentials are strong (Garcia cited the success of the 
Brazil-Argentina ABACC mechanism for nuclear monitoring and 
confidence measures). 
 
5. (C) For those reasons, Garcia said the GOB believes Brazil 
deserves patience as it works through its concerns toward 
possible AP adherence, and he regretted media commentary that 
sometimes casts Brazil in the same suspicious company as Iran 
and North Korea.  Ambassador replied that no serious analyst 
would place Brazil in such a suspect category, but given the 
continued intense concern about nuclear security, Brazil\'s 
hesitation on the AP question fuels conspiratorial 
speculation among uninformed commentators. 
 
BRAZIL\'S DEVELOPMENT 
 
6. (SBU) In conclusion Garcia opined that Brazil continues to 
face several fundamental challenges on its road to real 
development.  These include: (1) stimulating substantial and 
lasting growth of the economy; (2) encouraging much fairer 
distribution of income; (3) diminishing Brazil\'s 
vulnerability to external economic shocks; (4) achieving 
lasting macroeconomic stability, and (5) continuing to expand 
and institutionalize democracy.  Garcia opined that managing 
all the challenges effectively will require decades of 
competent and energetic governance. 
 
7. (C)  Comment: Garcia seemed to enjoy our conversation and 
expressed interest in further contact.  He was expansive and 
thoughtful, his academic pedigree from years of teaching and 
study in Brazilian and European universities much in 
evidence.  While Garcia\'s intellectual influence on Lula\'s 
foreign policy likely remains strong, speculation earlier in 
Lula\'s administration that Garcia would dominate foreign 
policy -- even edging out FM Amorim -- does not appear to us 
borne out by events.  While Garcia accompanies Lula on most 
foreign trips, drafts the president\'s international speeches 
and has undertaken sensitive missions to Bolivia and 
Venezuela, it is not at all apparent that his positions on 
policy are decisive.  Nonetheless, we intend to maintain this 
channel to\"the professor\" (as he prefers to be called); his 
access to and influence over a president who has also been 
Garcia\'s close friend for decades make such engagement 
uniquely useful.

REF: A) Brasilia 2221 
 
     B) Brasilia 463 
     C) Sao Paulo 1328 
 
1.   (U) Summary:  Brazil is living one of its best economic 
moments in recent memory.  GDP growth has averaged above 6% 
on an annualized basis for the last three quarters.  The 
external accounts remain healthy as exports continue to 
boom; Brazil should run a 1.5% of GDP current account 
surplus this year, its second in a row.  Unemployment, while 
still high, has begun to fall while real incomes are 
beginning to rise after several years of decline. 
Inflationary pressures are building, however, leading the 
Central Bank to raise interest rates (by a quarter point) to 
16.25% on September 15.  The inflationary trajectory already 
has shifted; expected inflation in 2004 is for 7.37%, within 
the plus/minus 2.5 points band around the 5.5% target.  Due 
to these dynamics, the Central Bank on September 23 
announced the revision of its 2005 inflation target from 
4.5% to 5.1%. 
 
2.   (U) Strong revenue growth means the GoB is in the 
unfamiliar situation of having the option of tightening 
fiscal policy to take some of the burden off of monetary 
policy, without sacrificing expenditure.  The GoB announced 
on September 22 that it would increase the primary fiscal 
surplus target from 4.25% to 4.5% of GDP.  It hopes that 
formalizing the new target will help limit interest rate 
increases while allowing the GoB to continue to reduce the 
debt-GDP-ratio.  Already the debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen 
from 58.6% in December 2003 and may close out the year at 
about 55%, which would mark the first year-on-year decline 
in the debt-to-GDP ratio in a decade. 
 
3.   (SBU) Brazil took advantage of the positive situation 
to tap international markets with an over-subscribed Euro 
750 million eight-year bond, at a spread of 477 basis points 
above the benchmark German Treasury note.  Standard and 
Poor\'s recognized the progress by upgrading Brazil\'s credit 
rating to BB-, the same level it had before the 2002 crisis. 
Current low, albeit growing, investment levels mean the 
economy should cool off in the near term from current growth 
rates.  But, the good economic news should strengthen 
President Lula\'s hand as he implements rigorously orthodox 
economic and fiscal policies and pursues structural reforms 
critical to boosting weak savings and investment to the 
levels necessary for faster economic growth.  The economic 
news may also help candidates from Lula\'s Workers\' Party 
(PT) in the October 3 nationwide municipal elections.  End 
Summary. 
 
The Good News 
------------- 
 
4.   (U) The good economic news has been rolling in 
recently, with the Brazilian economy posting its fourth 
consecutive quarter of growth and the third at an annualized 
rate of over 6% (ref A).  Analysts have been busily revising 
upwards their growth projections for the year:  according to 
Central Bank survey data, the market now expects growth of 
4.36% this year, and some respected analysts are predicting 
growth as high as 4.7%.  It is not clear whether the economy 
has begun to cool off since the end of the second quarter. 
One closely-watched leading indicator, sales of packaging 
products, dropped over 4% in August, albeit after a July 
increase of over 5%.  Some analysts suggest this data point 
meant the economy has reached an inflection point and begun 
to trend towards the expected 2005 growth rate of 3.5%.  But 
other indicators from the same time frame, such as steel 
production, show little sign of such a cooling. 
 
5.   (U) Employment growth, which had lagged a bit, has now 
begun to pick up markedly.  While unemployment is still high 
and remains a political issue, new GoB data show record 
formal employment creation in January to August (677,900 net 
new jobs).  The recovery is broadening across sectors, with 
consumption spending picking up.  External accounts remain 
very favorable, with export growth leading to a predicted 
trade surplus of $30 billion and an overall current account 
surplus for the year of 1.2% of GDP.  The weakest part of 
the external accounts had been Foreign Direct Investment 
(FDI), but after a recent uptick the Central Bank has 
revised its prediction of total FDI for the year from $13 
billion to $17 billion. 
 
But, Inflationary Pressure Rears its Ugly Head 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.   (U) Inflationary expectations, however, also have been 
mounting.  Wholesale price pressures fed by high capacity 
utilization, particularly in the intermediate goods 
industries such as steel, have been feeding through to 
consumer prices.  Workers are beginning to increase wage 
demands (such as the currently-striking bank employees) to 
make up for years of sliding real incomes (ref C). 
Companies are often acceding to union pressure and granting 
wage increases above inflation.  Energy prices also have 
contributed to the mounting inflationary pressures. 
Accumulated inflation in the year through August clocked in 
at 5.14%.  The market consensus as of September 17 was for 
consumer price inflation of 7.37% this year, substantially 
above the official 5.5% target, but still within the band of 
plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. 
 
Balancing Monetary and Fiscal Policies 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7.   (U) Given these increasing inflationary pressures, the 
Central Bank on September 15 hiked the basic SELIC interest 
rate by a quarter percent to 16.25%.  Unlike some of the 
previous rate decisions this year, the Central Bank 
telegraphed its intentions well, using the minutes of the 
August monetary policy meeting to lay the groundwork with 
the market for an increase.  Public debate has shifted to 
how quickly and to what degree the Central Bank needs to 
increase interest rates to tamp down emerging inflation. 
The minutes of the September 14-15 Central Bank monetary 
policy meeting make clear that the Bank sees the September 
15 hike as the first in a \"process of moderate adjustment\" 
of monetary policy, implying further interest rate 
increases.  Increased inflationary expectations have 
actually reduced forward-looking real interest rates by 
about a percentage point since April, when the Central Bank 
last cut the nominal interest rate to 16%.  This process of 
nominal adjustment would reverse some or all of that slide 
in real interest rates. 
 
8.   (U) Strong revenue growth this year has given the GoB a 
realistic fiscal policy option to help head off increased 
interest rates.  On September 22 the GoB announced it had 
increased its primary surplus target for 2004 from 4.25% of 
GDP to 4.5% of GDP.  Analysts argue that this should help 
ease the burden on monetary policy in managing inflationary 
expectations, allowing the Central Bank to limit the 
necessary interest rate increases.  Notwithstanding feelings 
by some in President Lula\'s inner circle (notably Chief of 
Staff Jose Dirceu) that the GoB needed to dedicate part of 
its windfall to social and investment programs, Lula took to 
the airwaves September 23 to justify the decision, arguing 
it was better to pay down debt with the extra revenue than 
simply spend it.  The debt-to-GDP ratio at end-year may be 
as low as 55%, according to some analyses, down 4.6 points 
on the year. 
9.   (SBU) One analyst with the Institute for Applied 
Economic Research (IPEA) told Econoff that the GoB really 
had no choice but to exceed the original 4.25% target, since 
revenues are running so far ahead of predictions while 
expenditures are ultimately capped by the 2004 budget law. 
(For example, last year\'s revisions to COFINS, a social tax 
paid on revenues, have brought in additional percentage 
point of GDP in revenues, according to the IMF ResRep; 
revenues also have been buoyed by the strong GDP growth. 
Note:  The official prediction now is a total federal 
government revenue increase of 1.1% of GDP.)  The IPEA 
economist opined that while the GoB might have considered 
trying to spend more, it would have had to obtain 
Congressional approval for a supplemental budgetary 
authorization.  This, however, would put the GoB in the 
uncomfortable position of acknowledging that the Congress\'s 
growth and revenue predictions, which the Executive 
criticized in January as inflated during a sometimes 
acrimonious debate over cautionary spending freezes, were in 
fact closer to the mark than the GoB\'s (Ref B). 
 
10.  (U) Looking forward to next year, the Central Bank 
acknowledged in the minutes of its September 14-15 monetary 
policy meeting, published on September 23, that the 
trajectory of inflation has made unrealistic, without a 
sharper monetary response, the achievement of the 2005 
inflation target of 4.5%.  It decided to accommodate 
partially that inflationary inertia and announced a new 2005 
inflation target of 5.1%.  Subsequent to the Central Bank 
decision, the September IPCA-15 (a version of Brazil\'s 
consumer price index calculated on the 15th of each month, 
one of Brazil\'s rich heritage of inflation indices) clocked 
in at 0.49%, lower than had been anticipated. 
 
International Markets 
--------------------- 
 
11.   (U) The GoB took advantage of a favorable 
international market to launch on September 8 a Euro 750 
million 8-year fixed-rate bond at a spread of 477 basis 
points over the benchmark German treasury note.  The issue 
was oversubscribed, which allowed the GoB to increase the 
amount from Euro 500 million.  The GoB then reopened the 
placement and issued a further Euro 250 million on September 
22, for a total placement of Euro 1 billion.   With this 
bond, the GoB has completed its borrowing program for the 
year on international markets, though some speculate the GoB 
will seek yet another Eurobond placement prior to year\'s end 
to increase international reserves and/or get a head start 
on 2005 borrowing.  At both the September 8 and September 22 
auctions, spreads were down markedly from the GoB\'s June and 
July issues, which were launched strategically after May and 
early June financial market turbulence to pave the way for 
private Brazilian borrowers to re-access international 
markets.  Standard and Poor\'s (S&P) recognized the progress 
by upgrading Brazil\'s credit rating to BB-, the same level 
it had before the 2002 crisis.  The move by S&P came eight 
days after Moody\'s had raised its Brazil rating to B1. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
12.  (SBU) The GoB had only the most fleeting of instants to 
sit back and enjoy the positive macroeconomic moment before 
shifting focus to combat new threats.  While inflation is 
not out of hand and remains the lesser concern, investment, 
expected to hit 19% of GDP by end-year, will not bring on- 
stream enough capacity quickly enough to sustain growth at 
the current rates.  Sustaining growth even at more moderate 
rates (3.5% to 4.5% range) will require implementation of 
more of the GoB structural reform agenda, including the 
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) legislation, bankruptcy law 
and reform of the judiciary.  These still are pending 
congressional approval, with the PPP law (slated for a 
Senate vote after the upcoming October municipal elections) 
the closest to passage.  Investors also would like to see a 
lower tax burden and more predictable (and less 
bureaucratic) regulatory environment, items on which it will 
be difficult for the GoB to make substantial progress in the 
short term.  Still, the recession-weary public is beginning 
to breathe a collective sigh of relief.  And, as the old 
adage goes, \"nothing succeeds like success.\"  Both factors 
should give Lula and his macroeconomic guru, FinMin Palocci, 
greater space to pursue their orthodox fiscal and monetary 
policies and the structural reform agenda.

Homeland Security Working Group (HSWG) meetings, chaired by 
the DCM or by NAS. 
 
c) (SBU) The HSWG brings together law enforcement and policy 
agencies at post to exchange information, including about TF- 
related training programs and exchanges.  The Deputy TFCO 
has created and maintains a database of these programs as a 
reference, based in part on the information exchanged in the 
HSWG meetings.  Post has found it useful to hold its Visas 
Viper Committee meetings at the same time. 
 
d) (SBU) Post has found the circulation by cable of the 
informal TF Coalition-building sub-group meeting minutes to 
be a useful tool for understanding what Washington is 
thinking.  We encourage more of this informal exchange, 
including information on other meetings. 
 
e) (SBU) TF is not sufficiently on the radar screen with the 
public in Brazil.  With an eye to public affairs on this 
topic, this embassy would like to place one or more 
authoritative opinion pieces over the bylines of relevant 
senior officials in the Brazilian media.  Post also is 
planning the use of International Visitor and Voluntary 
Visitor grants in the education of relevant high-level 
embassy contacts. 
 
f) (U) Neither the TFCO nor his Deputy have received TF 
training. 
 
g) (SBU) Post continues to work with an S/CT allotment 
(administered by INL/C) and in cooperation with the OAS to 
assist in the modernization of Brazil\'s financial 
intelligence unit, COAF.  We have delivered analytical 
software and some computer equipment to COAF under this 
effort, and OAS will be providing training.  Since COAF is 
but a small part of the anti-terror finance process in 
Brazil, Post continues to believe it would be beneficial to 
use some of the remaining monies under this allotment in 
ways that would foster interagency cooperation among the 
relevant Brazilian agencies, an acknowledged weakness in 
their system.  Potential uses include providing training or 
exchanges for an interagency group.  Post requests 
Washington flexibility on this point.

SUBJECT: SCENESETTER: THE SECRETARY\'S VISIT TO BRAZIL, 4-6 
OCTOBER 2004 
 
 
1. (SBU) The United States Mission in Brazil warmly welcomes 
your visit to Sao Paulo and Brasilia.  You are the senior USG 
official to travel to Brazil during the administration of 
President Lula da Silva.  Your visit has been much sought 
after by the GOB, and the President and Foreign Minister 
Amorim will view their meetings with you as invaluable 
opportunities to exchange views.  In Sao Paulo, you will 
address the American Chamber of Commerce of an industrialized 
metropolis that is one of the world\'s most populous cities 
and capital of the state that generates a third of Brazil\'s 
GDP. In both cities you will interact with young Brazilians 
who have benefited from U.S. Government and private corporate 
outreach programs.  A brief list of key issues that may be 
discussed in the official meetings is at paragraph 2. 
General background on Brazil follows in paragraphs 3-9. 
 
KEY ISSUES 
---------- 
2. (SBU) Issues that may be raised in your meetings with the 
GOB include: 
 
-- Bilateral Relations: Follow up to the 2003 Presidential 
summit, working together on future challenges (e.g., 
successful cooperation at Doha), proposal of a possible 
Defense Cooperation Agreement 
-- Brazil and the International Hunger Initiative: Follow up 
to 20 September meeting 
-- UNSC: Council Reform (including Brazil\'s desire for a 
permanent seat), Haiti PKO, Iraq, Darfur, Middle East peace 
issues 
-- Non-Proliferation: Iran, Brazil-IAEA discussions on 
Additional Protocol, 2005 NPT Review Conference 
-- Regional: Current situations in Venezuela and Bolivia 
-- Trade: Way ahead on FTAA and WTO; piracy issues (GSP and 
IPR) 
 
GENERAL 
------- 
3. (SBU)  Brazil is the largest country in Latin America in 
area (bigger than the continental U.S.) and population (182 
million).  It is a strong democracy and an economic 
powerhouse, with a thriving industrial base producing and 
exporting products ranging from airplanes to shoes. Its 
agricultural sector leads the world in production of many 
crops (Brazil\'s agricultural exports to the US are seven 
times higher than U.S. agricultural exports to Brazil). In 
recent months, the Brazilian economy has shown signs of 
growth based on sound government fiscal policy.  However, 
despite its robust democracy and economic force, Brazil still 
has one of the world\'s most unequal distributions of income 
and land, and suffers from severe criminal violence. 
 
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LANDSCAPE 
------------------------------ 
4. (SBU) Brazil\'s democracy is less than two decades old, 
having succeeded the military regime that ruled from 
1964-1985. Lula da Silva, the country\'s first working-class 
president, took office in January 2003.  He passed important 
tax and pension reforms but has made little progress on his 
social agenda, including his flagship Zero Hunger project. 
Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) leads an eight-party coalition 
that holds a majority in both houses of Congress, but the 
coalition is undisciplined, and Lula must make compromises to 
pass his legislation. On October 3, the first round of 
nationwide municipal elections will be held to select the 
country\'s mayors and city councils.  Many key races, 
including the mayor of Sao Paulo, are likely to go to a 
second-round runoff on October 31.  National elections will 
be held in 2006, and Lula is expected to seek a second term. 
 
5. (SBU) The administration\'s social agenda has not met 
expectations, as resources have been limited by the 
government\'s spending cuts.  The Landless Movement (MST), a 
traditional ally of the Workers\' Party, has continued to 
carry out land invasions across the country.  Organized crime 
and violence linked to narcotrafficking are acute, 
particularly in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, where at times 
the authorities  exert only tenuous control.  The GOB is 
fighting back -- in October 2004, the GOB will implement a 
program authorizing the Brazilian air force to shoot down 
illegal narco-trafficking flights. 
 
6. (SBU) Under President Lula, Brazil has achieved a higher 
international profile, reflected in its leading role in South 
America, its push for a UNSC permanent seat, its spearheading 
of a \"G-20\" group of developing nations, its revitalization 
of Mercosul, and its constructive roles in Haiti and 
Venezuela.  Brazil is an important player on global issues 
such as hunger (witness the September 20 New York 
Conference), HIV/AIDS and the environment.  U.S./Brazilian 
cooperation has been key to progress on the WTO Doha round, 
including at July meetings in Geneva.  Brazil and the U.S. 
are co-chairs of the FTAA negotiations.  The GOB has focused 
on South America and developing countries, engaging 
intensively with Mercosul and forging a regional approach to 
trade talks.  Brazilians are commited to the UN and other 
multilateral institutions.  The majority of Brazilians oppose 
the war in Iraq.  Lula has voiced strong opposition to the 
war, but this has not prejudiced his approach to broader 
bilateral relations. 
 
ECONOMIC ISSUES 
--------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Brazil is living one of its best economic moments in 
recent history.  GDP growth has averaged above six percent 
for three quarters and external accounts remain healthy as 
exports boom. The economic news has been good enough to 
strengthen Lula\'s hand as he continues with his orthodox 
fiscal policies.  Brazil should run a 1.5 percent of GDP 
account surplus this year.  Unemployment, while still high, 
is falling and real incomes are starting to climb. Increasing 
inflationary pressures are causing the Central Bank to raise 
interest rates (to 16.25 percent).  Strong revenue growth 
places Brazil in a position of strength to deal with its main 
vulnerability: debt.  GOB measures to increase the primary 
fiscal surplus target are helping reduce the debt-to-GDP 
ratio; as a result, analysts have upgraded Brazil\'s credit 
rating. 
 
8. (SBU) Lula\'s economic challenges going forward are to 
implement structural reforms, (e.g., public-private 
partnership legislation, bankruptcy law and judicial reform) 
and to increase savings and investment to sustain the higher 
growth rates Brazil needs if the GOB is implement a 
significant program to address social inequalities. 
Potential investors also want to see lower taxes and and more 
rational regulatory environment. 
 
TRADE POLICY 
------------ 
 
9. (SBU)  Exports figure prominently in plans to fuel 
economic growth, yet the economic and social benefits of 
liberalizing trade are not widely promoted, and the fear of 
job losses remains.  In addition to seeking to boost exports 
through trade negotiations and export financing, the Lula 
government is trying to lower the \"Brazil cost\" of local 
production by addressing systemic problems through reforms to 
social security and other areas, and is looking to improve 
the country\'s crumbling infrastructure.  For economic and 
political reasons, the administration is seeking expanded 
trade ties, particularly with developing countries.  Brazil 
helped form the G-20 group at the WTO Cancun Ministerial in 
2003 and continues to lead this group.  Brazil and its 
Mercosul partners are negotiating trade agreements with the 
EU, South Africa, Russia, and India and are considering trade 
talks with China.  Brazilian exports to China have doubled in 
the last year.  Brazil places particular importance on 
expanding trade ties with its South American neighbors.  The 
US and Brazil have been co-chairs of the FTAA negotiations 
since November 2002.  It has been a difficult period fraught 
with uncertainty over Brazil\'s commitment to the 
negotiations.  While Lula has shed the extreme anti-FTAA 
rhetoric of the 2002 campaign, his administration has not 
embraced the accord as a priority, and Brazilian commercial 
interests have yet to overcome ideological hurdles to what is 
viewed as a U.S.-led initiative.

SUBJECT: RESULTS OF BRAZILIAN OCTOBER 3 ELECTIONS 
 
REF: BRASILIA 2484 
 
1.(SBU) SUMMARY.  The Workers\' Party (PT) of Brazilian 
President Lula da Silva did well in nationwide municipal 
elections on October 3, winning city hall in several of the 
largest cities, including six state capitals.  As expected, 
the Sao Paulo mayor\'s race will go to a second-round runoff, 
pitting the PT incumbent Marta Suplicy against the PSDB\'s 
Jose Serra.  These were municipal elections for 5,563 mayors 
and city councils nationwide, so no party scored a national 
knockout, but the PT expanded its number of city halls, both 
in the big cities and in the interior.  The centrist PMDB 
will continue to have the most mayors overall, followed by 
the PSDB.  These elections were local, and so were not a true 
litmus test for the Lula administration, but with the economy 
and Lula\'s popularity improving in recent months, several PT 
candidates made late gains and either won outright in the 
first round or made it into the October 31 second round. 
Similarly, the results do not give clear guidance for the 
2006 national elections, except to underscore that the PT and 
PSDB are the most vital parties at the national level, and 
are likely to face each other again in the 2006 presidential 
and Sao Paulo governor\'s races.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(SBU) THE SOUTHEAST 
--------------------- 
In Sao Paulo, Jose Serra (PSDB) at 44% and incumbent Marta 
Suplicy (PT) at 36% will go to a second-round runoff on 
October 31.  Polls have shown Serra defeating Marta in 
second-round projections and he is likely to prevail, but his 
margin of victory has been shrinking in recent weeks.  Both 
the PT and PSDB can be expected to mobilize their national 
stars on their candidates\' behalf during October. 
 
In Belo Horizonte, capital of Minas Gerais, incumbent 
Fernando Pimentel (PT) won a crushing first-round victory 
over challenger Joao Leite (PSB) by 68-22%.  Leite had the 
endorsement of Minas\'s popular PSDB governor, Aecio Neves. 
 
In Rio de Janeiro, incumbent Cesar Maia (PFL) won a 
first-round victory with 50.1%; defeating evangelical Senator 
Marcelo Crivella (PL) at 21%.  The PT is weak in Rio and its 
candidate won just 6%. 
 
In Vitoria, capital of Espirito Santo, Joao Coser (PT) at 37% 
and Cesar Colnagi (PSDB, endorsed by the outgoing PSDB mayor) 
at 34% will go to the second round.  Coser was an early 
long-shot, but made a strong finish to end up in first place. 
 Colnagi will likely get second-round votes from supporters 
of PP\'s conservative third-place finisher. 
 
3. (SBU) THE FAR SOUTH 
---------------------- 
Porto Alegre, in Rio Grande do Sul, is perhaps the PT\'s most 
cherished stronghold.  Raul Pont (PT) at 37% will face Jose 
Fogaca (PPS) who won 28%, in a second-round runoff.  Pont is 
trying to win the PT\'s fifth straight mayoral election in 
Porto Alegre. 
 
In Florianopolis, capital of Santa Catarina, Dario Berger 
(PSDB) at 35% should beat conservative Chico Assis (PP) who 
won 27%, in the second round, as the third- and forth-place 
finishers were from farther to the left. 
 
As expected Curitiba, in Parana, will see Beto Richa (PSDB) 
at 35%, face Angel Vanhoni (PT) who won 31%, in the 
second-round.  Vanhoni did well to get so close and has put 
the run-off outcome in doubt. 
 
4. (SBU) THE NORTHEAST 
---------------------- 
Salvador, capital of Bahia, is headquarters to the Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes (\"ACM\") PFL machine.  But ACM\'s candidate, 
Cesar Borges at 22%, badly trailed Joao Henrique (PDT) at 
43%.  Henrique is favored in the second-round because he will 
unite the PT (whose candidate won 22%) with other anti-ACM 
forces.  Pundits are already wondering if ACM\'s machine is 
beginning to crumble in its own home base. 
 
In Recife, in Pernambuco, incumbent Joao Paulo (PT) separated 
himself from a close race with Carlos Cadoca of the state\'s 
PMDB/PFL machine, handily winning a first-round reelection 
victory by 56-28%. 
Either the polling in Forteleza, capital of Ceara, was 
woefully poor, or many voters changed their minds in the 
final hours.  Moroni Torgan (PFL) at 26% and Luizianne Lins 
(PT maverick) at 22%, will go to a second-round runoff. 
Torgan and Lins were numbers two and four, respectively, in 
last week\'s polls.  Early front-runner Antonio Cambraia (of 
the state\'s PSDB machine), and communist Inacio Arruda 
(PCdoB) who was supported by the national PT party, finished 
third and fourth. 
 
Sao Luis, in Maranhao, is headquarters to the Sarney family 
PFL/PMDB machine, but the family split this year, allowing 
Tadeu Palacio (PDT) to win a first-round victory. 
 
In Maceio, capital of Alagoas, Cicero Almeida (PDT) won with 
43% of the vote.  Almeida pulled ahead of early favorite 
Alberto Sexta-Feira of the state\'s PSB machine, who got 27%. 
(With a population less than 200,000, Maceio will not have a 
second round.) 
 
Aracaju, in Sergipe, delivered the champion vote-getter this 
year.  PT incumbent Marcelo Deda crushed his PPS challenger 
by 71-18%.  Though from a small state, Deda should now have a 
national profile in the PT party. 
 
In Joao Pessoa, capital of Paraiba, Ricardo Coutinho (PSB) 
scored an impressive victory with 64% against Ruy Carneiro 
(PSDB) who won 30%.  The outgoing PMDB mayor endorsed 
Coutinho. 
 
Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, will see a second-round runoff 
between incumbent Carlos Eduardo Alves (PSB) who looked to do 
better than his tally of 37%, versus challenger Luiz Almir 
(PSDB) who won 30%. 
 
Teresina, capital of impoverished Piaui, gave physician 
Silvio Mendes (PSDB) 48%.  Mendes, supported by the outgoing 
PSDB mayor, is favored in the second round against Adalgisa 
Moraes Souza (PMDB) who won 25%.  Souza is the wife of 
PT-baiting Senator Mao Santa (PMDB). 
 
5. (SBU)  THE CENTER-WEST AND THE NORTH 
--------------------------------------- 
In Goiania, capital of Goias (the state that surrounds 
Brasilia), PMDB dinosaur Iris Rezende (PMDB) won 47% and is 
favored in the second round against PT incumbent Pedro 
Wilson, who won 23% after his candidacy was nearly canceled 
by an electoral judge for campaign violations. 
 
In Cuiaba, Mato Grosso state, long-shot PT candidate 
Alexandre Cesar won a surprising 33% and will go to the 
second round against the PSDB\'s Wilson Santos who won 36%. 
These results are a big disappointment to the PPS, whose 
Sergio Ricardo was backed by the outgoing PPS incumbent. 
 
In Campo Grande, capital of Mato Grosso do Sul, as expected 
Nelsinho Trad (PMDB) won a first-round victory over Vander 
Loubet (PT), by 55-23%. 
 
Porto Velho, in Rondonia, will see a second-round runoff 
between two left-of-center candidates: Roberto Sobrinho (PT) 
who won 32%, and Mauro Nazif (PSB) at 30%. Nazif will be 
favored to win on October 31. 
 
In Rio Branco, Acre state, Raimundo Angelim (PT) came from 
behind for a gratifying 49-41% win over Marcio Bittar (PPS). 
(Rio Branco\'s population is under 200,000, so there is no 
second-round runoff.) 
 
Manaus, capital of Amazonas, will see a second-run runoff 
between PFL dinosaur Amazonino Mendes, whose 43% beat out PSB 
longshot Serafim Correa, at 28%.  The PT supported communist 
Vanessa Graziotin (PCdoB), who won 13%.  Former-Governor 
Mendes was expected to sweep to an easy first-round victory, 
but now faces a difficult runoff. 
 
Boa Vista, in Roraima, reelected incumbent Teresa Juca (PPS) 
with 56% of the vote. 
 
Macapa, in Amapa, as expected, reelected incumbent Joao 
Henrique (PT) with 41%.  (Macapa\'s population is under 
200,000, so there will be no second-round.) 
 
In Belem, capital of Para, favorite Duciomar Costa (PTB) won 
48% and will be forced to a second round by federal Senator 
Ana Julia Carepa (PT), who got 33%. 
 
In Palmas, capital of Tocantins, longshot Raul Filho (PT) 
scored a huge upset in a small state by crushing the PSDB 
candidate of the Siqueiro Campos machine, by 64-32%. 
 
COMMENT - PT AND PSDB SEEN AS WINNERS 
------------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) The incumbent PT Mayor of Sao Paulo, Marta Suplicy, 
was considerably outpolled by PSDB standard-bearer, Jose 
Serra, and the eight-point margin suggests  she is unlikely 
to beat him in the October 31 runoff.  But President Lula\'s 
PT did well elsewhere in the first round, winning six of 26 
state capitals outright, with a chance to win eight more in 
the second round.  Early results indicate the Workers\' 
Party\'s success was not limited to the big cities.  Of the 
5,563 mayors nationwide, the PT won 381 mayoralties yesterday 
--a big jump from the 187 it won in 2000.  For overall number 
of mayors, the PT still trails amorphous giant PMDB (1,014), 
as well as the opposition PSDB that won 828, the PFL with 
767, and the center-right PTB with 403.  Only the PT and PTB 
elected more mayors yesterday than they did in the 2000 
cycle.   Founded as an urban labor party, the PT defended its 
big-city incumbencies in Belo Horizonte and Recife, as well 
as winning the smaller capitals of Acre, Amapa, Sergipe and 
Tocantins.  The PT\'s disappointments include likely incumbent 
losses in Belem and Goiania and the squelching of higher 
hopes in some other venues. 
 
7. (SBU)  Meanwhile, the PSDB had fewer pieces at play in 
these capitals, as its strength is not concentrated in there. 
 The PSDB is surely gratified by Serra\'s showing in Sao Paulo 
and other strong showings in Sao Paulo state as well as in 
Piaui, Cuiaba, Curitiba and Espirito Santo.  However, the 
candidate endorsed by one of its star governors, Aecio Neves 
in Minas Gerais, got crushed by a PT incumbent, and its 
machine candidate in northeastern Ceara inexplicably failed 
to make the second round. 
 
COMMENT CONTINUED - OTHER PARTIES A MIXED BAG 
--------------------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) Cesar Maia,s first round reelection in Rio de 
Janeiro is a great triumph for the PFL, but the party did 
poorly in other big cities (particularly in traditional 
redoubts Salvador and Curitiba).  The small left-of-center 
PSB and PDT both did well, picking up two capitals each. 
The PMDB continued its pattern of resilience and decay, as it 
piled up hundreds of small town victories but, without any 
national stars, failed to win any big cities.  The 
conservative PP had a tough time, with reverses ranging from 
Paulo Maluf,s poor showing in Sao Paulo to losses in 
Florianopolis, Manaus, and Boa Vista.  The PCdoB (Communist 
Party of Brazil) generally supported PT candidates, and the 
communists\' only sitting mayor, Luciana Santos in Olinda 
(near Recife) was reelected with 55% of the vote.  Two other 
credible PCdoB candidates --in Manaus and Fortaleza-- failed 
to reach the second round.  But in Camaragibe, another Recife 
satellite town, Joao Lemos won and became the PCdoB\'s second 
mayor. 
 
 
JUDGE RECOGNIZES GAY MARRIAGE 
----------------------------- 
9. (SBU) Finally, one of the election\'s oddities was the 
Supreme Electoral Court indirectly recognizing gay marriage. 
Brazil has an election law designed to reduce the strength of 
family dynasties by prohibiting one family member from 
succeeding another in executive office.  The Supreme 
Electoral Court ruled that in the town of Viseu, in Para 
state, State Deputy Eulina Rabelo had established a 
legally-recognized \"stable wife-wife relationship\" with 
incumbent Mayor Astrid Maria Cunha, and therefore could not 
run to succeed her.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BR, Bilateral Relations with the US 
SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S CALL ON PRESIDENCY CHIEF OF STAFF 
DIRCEU, 1 OCTOBER 2004 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN J. DANILOVICH. REASONS: 1.4 
(B)(D). 
 
 1. (C) Summary. In an affable and candid first meeting with 
Ambassador, Presidential Chief of Staff and Lula right-hand 
man Jose Dirceu expressed optimism about bilateral relations, 
Brazil\'s economy and the potential for American investment in 
major new infrastructure projects.  At the same time, he 
acknowledged \"grave problems\" and challenges to sustained 
development -- including educational inadequacies, 
unemployment, heavy debt and severe crime -- but stressed the 
GOB\'s efforts to attack all of these.  He assured Ambassador 
that the GOB appreciates the current high sensitivity of 
nuclear non-proliferation issues and is \"95 percent there\" on 
conclusion of an agreement with the IAEA to facilitate agency 
inspections of Brazil\'s Rezende nuclear facility.  End 
summary. 
 
Bilateral and Regional Affairs 
 
2. (C) Dirceu opined that the U.S. and Brazil are \"enjoying 
their best bilateral relationship in 30 years.\"  Both 
governments, he said, know how to separate out points of 
disagreement from the many other areas in which cooperation 
is robust and fluid.  The excellent personal relationship 
between Presidents Bush and Lula da Silva augments the close 
ties between Brazilians and Americans in commerce, 
technology, sports, culture and other areas, Dirceu said. In 
regional affairs, Dirceu said that the U.S. and Brazil share 
a common interest in stability.  He said Lula had made a 
decision that placing Brazil in the lead PKO role in Haiti 
was \"important and worthwhile,\" and Brazil plans to continue 
its efforts to ameliorate tensions in Venezuela.  He added 
that Brazil will also continue to strengthen democratic 
institutions and economies in Bolivia and Paraguay. 
 
Internal Challenges 
 
3. (C) Internally, Dirceu expressed optimism about prospects 
for development, even as he recognized \"grave problems and 
challenges\" that Brazil must address over the next two to 
three decades.  These include the need: to expand educational 
opportunity throughout the population while adjusting 
priorities to address critical shortfalls Brazil faces in 
technical and medical disciplines; to use education and 
technical training to create conditions to absorb into the 
workforce \"millions of unemployed\" who are trapped in 
poverty; to attract financing for investment in 
infrastructure;  and to address comprehensively the critical 
problem of Brazil\'s heavy internal and external debt burdens. 
 On debt, Dirceu noted that the GOB had succeeded in reducing 
the \"dollarized\" portion of Brazil\'s internal debt from 40 
percent to about 15 percent, with efforts underway to bring 
the percentage down to 10 percent.  This is an important 
structural step to increase Brazil\'s defenses against 
external economic shocks, Dirceu added. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador observed that Brazil is, indeed, in an 
excellent position, with the GOB\'s fiscal policies applauded 
in financial centers worldwide, and Brazil\'s regional and 
international leadership recognized. But Ambassador observed 
that many potential investors still register concerns about 
the investment climate in Brazil, citing taxes, excessive 
regulation and other issues as impediments. 
 
5. (C) Dirceu agreed and repeatedly stressed the GOB\'s 
interest in attracting foreign investment in the 
infrastructure, including North American investment.  Dirceu 
said that the GOB is striving to award contracts in a 
completely transparent and objective manner.  He said the GOB 
is currently pursuing legislation to deal with lowering 
taxes, diminishing long-term capital investment costs, 
restructuring the mortgage real estate sector and adjusting 
bankruptcy laws.  The GOB is especially keen to bring 
investment back into the energy sector, Dirceu said, where 
Brazil has construction or planning underway for a total of 
57 hydroelectric plants.  Dirceu also stressed that he was 
personally responsible for some of the new iniatiatives 
Brazil\'s Public-Private Partnerships drive, with focus on 
attracting investment and stimulating construction activity 
(and employment opportunities) that will expand and improve 
Brazil\'s ports, railroads and highways. 
 
6. (C) Responding to Ambassador\'s observation that 
international perceptions that Brazil suffers a severe crime 
problem (e.g.,reference recent highly-publicized incidents on 
Ipanema/Leblon beaches in Rio) inhibit investment and 
tourism, Dirceu agreed and said the GOB is addressing public 
security as a top priority.  The GOB\'s recent announcement 
that Brazil would implement its 1998 law permitting lethal 
force interdiction of suspected narcotrafficking aircraft 
had, Dirceu claimed, already resulted in 40 to 50 percent 
reduction of suspect flights in the Amazon region (although 
there has also been a small increase in such activity along 
the Bolivia-Peru borders).  He said the GOB is also working 
to increase control along its frontiers, especially in the 
triborder and Amazon areas, and striving to enhance its 
intelligence capabilities.  Brazil\'s flawed state police 
system, in which patrol and investigative functions are 
awkwardly divided between competing uniformed and civil 
police services, needs reform and the GOB is taking the lead 
in encouraging integration of key functions.  Observing that 
corruption and infiltration of criminal elements into the 
police and justice systems of many states is endemic, Dirceu 
claimed that it is necessary for the federal government to 
lead on improving law enforcement against organized crime and 
trafficking in Brazil.  Federal Police operations against 
organized crime and money laundering over the past 20 months 
are indicative of the current administration\'s assumption of 
this responsibility, which is a first in Brazil\'s history, 
Dirceu said. 
 
Non-Proliferation 
 
7. (C) Ambassador raised the issue of Brazil\'s cooperation 
with the IAEA in negotiating inspections at the Rezende 
nuclear facility and with regard to the Additional Protocol 
to the NPT.  Ambassador stressed that the USG fully 
understands that Brazil\'s credential in non-proliferation are 
superb, and there is no suspicion that Brazil\'s nuclear 
program is directed toward weapons activities.  Nonetheless, 
Ambassador stressed that the highly-charged question of 
mobilizing international pressure against nuclear weapons 
development in North Korea and Iran make Brazil\'s reluctance 
on inspections and the AP extremely awkward.  Dirceu 
immediately acknowledged that he and President Lula 
understand the political sensitivity of the issue, have been 
meeting weekly with the Defense and Science Ministers to 
discuss resolutions, and Dirceu opined that he felt the IAEA 
and GOB are \"95 percent there\" in coming to an agreement for 
Rezende inspections in the near future. 
 
8. (C) Comment: Dirceu was affable, candid and thoughtful in 
his observations, and clearly interested in maintaining 
continued contact with Ambassador.  He indicated he would 
encourage President Lula to make a stop in California (en 
route perhaps to the Orient of a future trip) to see Silicon 
Valley, talk to investors and firms with presence in Brazil, 
and speak at Stanford University (Dirceu\'s interest seemed 
fueled partly by his expression of a life-long desire to 
visit San Francisco).  While some of his comments may have 
been boilerplate, Dirceu was quite energetically engaged in 
appealing for American interest in new infrastructure 
investment opportunities, and extremely alert and reactive in 
discussing the IAEA issues.

1.  (U) This cable is Sensitive But Unclassified. 
 
2.  (U) Summary and Introduction.  Deputy United States Trade 
Representative Peter F. Allgeier led an interagency 
delegation to Brasilia, Brazil for the September 22 meeting 
of the U.S.-Brazil Bilateral Consultative Mechanism (BCM). 
Ambassador Clodoaldo Hugueney, Undersecretary for Economic 
and Technological Affairs, led the Brazilian delegation.  The 
U.S. delegation consisted of USDOC DAS Walter Bastian, USTR 
Senior Director for Brazil and the Southern Cone Sue Cronin, 
State WHA/BSC Deputy Director Len Kusnitz, State EB/TPP/BTA 
Chief Robin Matthewman, Chris Merriam of USDOJ, USPTO 
Attorney-Advisor Caridad Berdut, and AmEmbassy Brasilia 
officials.  The meeting addressed bilateral trade issues, 
principally the enforcement of intellectual property laws 
regarding copyright piracy.  The agenda also included 
discussions on a pending U.S. antidumping investigation 
against Brazilian shrimp, possible discrimination against 
U.S. exports of soda ash into Rio state, and potential 
exports of Brazilian fresh beef into the United States.  On 
September 21, DUSTR Allgeier met with copyright industry 
representatives in Sao Paulo (refa) and addressed the Sao 
Paulo American Chamber of Commerce, enroute to Brasilia.  End 
Summary and Introduction. 
 
Copyright Protection and the GSP review 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3 .  (U) The main agenda item for the Bilateral Consultative 
Mechanism meeting was the presentation of reports by both 
countries on the enforcement of copyright law.  The reports 
stemmed from discussions held by a BCM bilateral IPR working 
group, which was formed following the June 30 USTR 
announcement of a ninety-day extension of a review of 
Brazil\'s trade benefits under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) due to concern over copyright enforcement. 
The U.S. gave a summary of its written report (based on the 
2003 NIPLECC report to Congress) emphasizing the importance 
of the ex parte power enjoyed by U.S. Customs Border 
Protection in identifying and seizing contraband at the 
border, and the Department of Justice\'s prosecutions of 
copyright offenses, including prison sentences and fines. 
The U.S. also discussed the role of the Copyright Office in 
advising the Congress on IPR issues and the work of the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office. 
 
4.  (SBU) At the September 9-10 meeting of the BCM working 
group on IPR in Washington, the USG had asked Brazil a series 
of questions regarding enforcement, with the hope that these 
questions would guide Brazil toward providing particular 
information in the report (refb).  The questions asked 
concerned: 1) results of enforcement efforts, including 
statistics on arrests, prosecutions, and convictions; 2) 
cooperation with Paraguay stemming from the meeting between 
President Lula and President Frutos on August 26, 2004; 3) 
reports on any anti-piracy raids undertaken; 4) inspections 
on the Friendship Bridge (Foz do Iguacu), including results; 
5) the status of the decree that would create a new national 
council to combat piracy, including the timeframe for issuing 
the decree; 6) the initiation of a national media campaign to 
fight piracy (the U.S. delegation to the Working Group asked 
that the Lula Administration take a stand in publicly 
promoting anti-piracy efforts); and 7) support for 
legislation proposed by the Brazilian Congressional 
Investigative Committee on Piracy (CPI) (the U.S. delegation 
asked that the Administration make some pronouncement 
regarding the GoB\'s IPR protection legislation, even if 
simply endorsing its objectives). 
 
5.  (SBU) At the September 22 BCM meeting, Brazil presented a 
summary of its report addressing some, though not all, of the 
issues raised September 9-10.   Hugueney described the report 
as the first document fully consolidating information on 
Brazil\'s wide-ranging efforts to enforce copyright law.  He 
said that he was impressed with the work that had been done, 
and that this effort should satisfy the concerns of the 
United States.  Brazil\'s summary highlighted new legislative 
provisions lengthening prison terms; training efforts; 
increased public awareness; the need for international 
cooperation; a nationwide reduction in software piracy; an 
increase in the rate of CD seizures (up 200 percent); various 
raids and investigations; increased inspections of buses on 
the Friendship Bridge; a new priority within Mercosul to 
fight piracy; the importance of the Congressional 
Investigative Committee report on piracy and tax evasion; 
legislation recommended in the CPI report (two bills dealing 
with copyright protection and others on smuggling and 
piracy), and establishment of an inter-ministerial council 
which would produce a national action plan.  (Note: the 
decree to establish the council has not yet been signed by 
the president). 
 
6.  (SBU) Following Brazil\'s summary, various agencies 
contributed additional information.  The representative from 
the Ministry of Justice said that combating piracy was a 
primary concern to the MoJ.  He noted that the MOJ cooperates 
closely with customs and will start checking on the 
immigration status of people dealing in pirated goods.  He 
also said the MOJ would be considerinh state-level 
specialized courts for piracy and smuggling. 
 
7.  (U) The Brazilian Federal Police noted that four tons of 
IT products coming from Miami had recently been seized. 
Further comments included the observation that cyber-crime 
was getting increased attention, and that most counterfeit 
CD\'s contain Brazilian music providing Brazil with an 
incentive to work to stop the problem.   The Federal Police 
representative noted the formation of a special division to 
deal with copyright crimes. 
 
8.  (U) Brazil\'s Internal Revenue and Customs representative 
said that his agency was updating and modernizing its 
practices, in particular, improving risk assessment 
procedures and working with the private sector.  He also 
noted that Brazil has a cooperative agreement with U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection. 
 
9.  (SBU) Hugueney characterized the exchange between the two 
sides as \"very positive\".  He found Brazil\'s report reflected 
recent enhancement of measures to combat piracy and that the 
exchange of views on actions was very useful.   He hoped the 
report, plus the CPI efforts, would demonstrate Brazil\'s 
commitment to combating copyright piracy.  Allgeier commented 
that he hoped the BCM would continue to deal with IP problems 
on a continuing basis.  He expressed USG hopes that the new 
Council be formed and begin work on developing and 
implementing the national intellectual property right 
protection plan very soon. 
 
10.  (U) U.S. Delegation member Chris Merriman (USDOJ) gave 
an overview of international cooperation opportunities, 
including Operation Fast Link and noted that meeting with GoB 
law enforcement officials within the IPR Working Group had 
been beneficial.  In addition, Attorney-Advisor Caridad 
Berdut (USPTO) described the role of her agency in combating 
piracy, with an emphasis on training opportunities. 
 
11.  (U) At the conclusion of the IP discussion, Ambassador 
Allgeier provided an overview of the GSP petition process. 
He explained that the U.S. Congress had included in GSP 
legislation a variety of conditions that need to be met by 
countries receiving benefits, one of which is adequate 
enforcement of intellectual property laws. He described next 
steps in considering the International Intellectual Property 
Alliance\'s GSP petition on Brazil, including an interagency 
review after September 30 of information provided in the GOB 
report.  He suggested that intellectual property protection 
remain a part of the BCM agenda to which Hugueney tentatively 
agreed. 
 
The Doha Round 
-------------------- 
 
12.  (SBU) Allgeier and Hugueney discussed the framework 
agreement, non-agricultural market access, services and the 
special and deferential treatment package that should 
contribute to progress.   Both agreed that work needs to be 
accelerated to achieve sufficient progress in time for the 
Hong Kong Ministerial. 
 
Trade and Economic Overview 
-------------------- 
13.  (SBU) Hugueney expressed concerns about the relatively 
limited growth in bilateral trade and the decline in 
investment by U.S. companies.  In response, DOC DAS Walter 
Bastian highlighted positive examples of U.S.-Brazil 
commercial relationships by thanking those present for their 
assistance and sense of fair play regarding Motorola\'s bid on 
the Federal Police communications system contract, and 
mentioning the selection of the Embraer/Lockheed Martin team 
to provide an aircraft platform for the US Army\'s Aerial 
Common Sensor program.  He noted that this USG decision 
demonstrates that Brazilian companies can compete on a level 
playing field, even in the traditionally sensitive area of 
military procurement.  Bastian pointed out that although 
Brazil is the United States\' third largest trading partner in 
the hemisphere behind Canada and Mexico, the volume pales in 
comparison.  While part of the difference may be attributable 
to geography, part may also reflect the commercial and 
investment climate.  Bastian gave indications based on 
concerns expressed by U.S. businesses for why it has been a 
challenge for Brazil to attract competitive investment. 
These concerns include unclear and complicated regulations at 
all levels of government, lack of transparency, bureaucratic 
bottlenecks, critical infrastructure deficiencies, 
inefficient customs and slow judicial proceedings.  Bastian 
cited a World Bank study of business practices in 133 
countries as independent evidence that that these types of 
issues need attention in the context of competitiveness, 
noting that Brazil ranked 6th to last when it comes to the 
burden of red tape in opening a company. 
 
14.  (SBU) Bastian raised the possibility of establishing 
informal commercial exchanges (ICE) between Brazil and the 
United States, an idea initially broached between DOC Under 
Secretary Aldonas and GoB Minister of Development, Industry 
 
SIPDIS 
and Trade, Luiz Furlan, to provide a forum for discussion of 
issues of mutual interest, such as issues of competitiveness, 
corporate governance, and mitigation of the commercial impact 
of strengthened security measures.  Bastian noted that these 
would not be for high-level policy discussions, but 
foundational fora for business interests with a goal to 
prepare the private sector to pro-actively identify issues 
and address regulations.  Bastian noted that the U.S. and 
Mexico have a number of these groups that work well, and that 
the idea was not duplicative of the BCM; there are already 
Brazil/U.S. counterpart discussions between Ministries of 
Agriculture, Energy, Finance, for example.  Hugueney opined 
that the decline in investment in Brazil is part of a global 
trend, rather than an indication of Brazil\'s competitiveness. 
 Nonetheless, he expressed openness toward a possible ICE 
dialog. 
 
Shrimp Anti-Dumping Case 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
15.  (SBU) Hugueney explained GoB sensitivities regarding the 
current antidumping investigation on shrimp, pointing out 
that it potentially will hit a sector that has been providing 
growing employment in the poorest region in Brazil. He 
expressed hope that withdrawal from the investigation of a 
company that had been assessed the highest preliminary 
dumping margin would lower any dumping margin that may be 
calculated for \"other\" producers in the DOC\'s final 
determination.  Hugueney provided Allgeier and Bastian with a 
nonpaper on the issues and noted that the GOB will continue 
to closely monitor the case.  DAS Bastian noted that the DOC 
was aware of Norte Pesca\'s withdrawal from the investigation 
and acknowledged the effect this could have on the \"all 
others\" rate in the final determination, all else being 
equal.  Bastian underscored the transparency and the 
deliberative legal aspect of the process, and explained that 
a final determination would be made in December.  DAS Bastian 
also noted that the DOC Import Administration has provided 
technical assistance on antidumping procedures to other 
countries in the past, and Brazil expressed an interest in 
pursuing this type of opportunity. 
 
SPS - Beef 
------------- 
16.  (U) Regarding Brazil\'s request for certification to 
export fresh, chilled and frozen beef products to the United 
States, Allgeier noted that there would be a meeting of the 
U.S.-Brazil Consultative Committee on Agriculture the week of 
September 27, which would include discussion of this matter, 
including, the issue of the presence (or lack thereof) of 
foot and mouth disease.  He added that the USG was working 
closely with Brazil. 
 
Soda Ash 
----------- 
17. (SBU)  Allgeier raised concern over possible 
discrimination against U.S. soda ash exports entering the 
state of Rio de Janeiro due to preferential tax treatment for 
a domestic soda ash producer.  Post and other USG officials 
had raised the issue with the GoB on past occasions. 
Hugueney said tax experts from the state of Rio had assured 
the Foreign Ministry that there was no discrimination against 
foreign suppliers.  According to Hugueney, they claimed that 
Rio state has merely provided an excise tax payment option 
designed to reduce the accounting burden for small producers, 
as opposed to providing them with a lower tax burden. 
Hugueney admitted, however, that he did not fully understand 
all the details and suggested the two countries convene 
experts to further discuss the matter.  Post will follow up. 
 
18.  (U)  This cable has been cleared by DUSTR Allgeier.

2. (SBU) Summary and Introduction.  Post offers the following 
thoughts as interagency deliberations proceed on review of 
Brazil\'s trade benefits under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) resulting from a petition filed by the 
International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) that 
alleges the country provides inadequate copyright protection. 
 Post is not averse to removing GSP trade benefits from 
Brazil should it cease cooperating with the USG within the 
GSP/IPR review process and fail to follow through on 
substantive actions to combat piracy.  However, a number of 
positive developments have emerged during the bilateral 
consultative process stemming from the GSP review.  While 
insufficient to warrant a closure of the investigation, Post 
believes a move toward punitive action at this juncture would 
be counterproductive.  Post recommends that the GSP review be 
extended for a substantial period of time to encourage 
continued constructive engagement with the GoB on copyright 
enforcement, and to enable evaluation of the effectiveness of 
anti-piracy measures it has recently put into motion and its 
commitment for future action.  Post also proposes 
consideration of technical assistance, as warranted, to help 
the GoB advance its anti-piracy efforts.  End Summary and 
Introduction. 
 
Positive Developments 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Work by Brazil\'s Congressional Investigative 
Committee (CPI) on Piracy, and extension of the USG\'s GSP 
review have compelled the GoB to focus attention and 
resources on fighting copyright piracy.  The CPI has been 
persuasive in arguing to the Executive Branch and public that 
the level of economic informality, crime, and tax evasion 
bred by piracy is crippling Brazil\'s development. It is 
finally starting to dawn on opinion leaders that piracy hurts 
Brazil even more than it does U.S. copyright industries.  The 
GSP review brought home potential negative international 
consequences of GoB inaction to stem the tide, but also 
presented an opportunity for the United States and Brazil to 
recast a typically contentious issue as one in which 
collaboration could bear fruit. 
 
4. (SBU) During the 90-day GSP review extension, which ended 
September 30, the GoB accelerated consideration and action on 
a number of recommendations included in the CPI\'s final 
report.  Most notable were formation of a public-private 
sector national council to combat piracy, and Mercosul 
deliberations, led by Brazil, on coordinating anti-piracy 
efforts region-wide.  (Note: The Presidential Palace issued a 
&medida provisoria8 to enable formation of the council 
within the Ministry of Justice, but the presidential decree 
establishing the council has not yet been signed.) The GOB 
has also conducted raids (admittedly, without coordination at 
the federal level and without bringing convictions) and 
continues to strengthen its border measures, for example, by 
blocking the free-customs transit of blank CD-ROM\'s through 
Paraguay and cracking down on buses smuggling cargo across 
the border. 
 
5. (SBU) A further positive development has been the 
empowerment of Brazilian government entities that 
institutionally share our interest in tougher IPR 
enforcement.  Through the CPI\'s efforts, agencies such as the 
Federal Police and Customs have gained greater stature within 
the administration for their roles in fighting piracy and 
smuggling, enhancing their ability to secure political and 
financial support for this effort.  Likewise, now that those 
agencies have opened lines of communication among themselves, 
coordinated action -- as opposed to efforts by individual 
ministries -- is becoming more the norm.  Interaction on a 
technical as well as political level in the bilateral IPR 
Working Group has opened additional channels for discourse 
between our two governments, undercutting the more 
antagonistic Foreign Ministry as the exclusive government 
interlocutor on IPR issues.  The make-up of the new council 
may also help bolster these like-minded agencies and 
ministries; it is being established as a permanent organ of 
the Ministry of Justice, headed by its Executive Secretary, 
and will include representatives of the Federal Police as 
well as private sector. 
 
Shortcomings 
----------------- 
 
6. (SBU) During the September 22 meeting of the Bilateral 
Consultative Mechanism (reftel), Ambassador Hugueney 
commented that he had been surprised at what the GoB had been 
able to accomplish in such a short time, implicitly 
acknowledging that the GSP threat had compelled the GoB to 
mobilize on the issue.  He claimed the GoB\'s actions 
represented a sincere and determined effort to address 
Brazil\'s piracy problem, and that this should be sufficient 
reason to close the investigation resulting from the 2001 
IIPA petition.  Embassy does not agree.  We believe that 
ninety days is too short a time to turnaround what has been 
for years a worsening piracy situation -- recent GoB actions 
represent only a start. 
 
7. (SBU) There still is no \"national\" policy or strategy for 
combating piracy and without one the prospect for 
significant, sustained improvement in copyright protection in 
Brazil is dim.  The GoB answer is the new council, which will 
explicitly be charged with shaping and implementing a 
national plan.  While there is plenty of room for skepticism 
concerning the council, given the inadequate performance of 
the lower level inter-ministerial committee formed in 2001, 
the context in which the council is being formed is quite 
different.  The scourge of piracy was not an issue in public 
debate in 2001, but the CPI has brought it front and center 
as an urgent domestic issue.  Furthermore, with six seats at 
the table, private sector participation in the Council should 
help ensure that its work is focused and relevant. 
 
Recommendations 
---------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Despite Ambassador Hugueney\'s urgings, the situation 
on the ground has not improved sufficiently to warrant 
closure of the IIPA investigation.  But likewise, the 
constructive way in which the GoB has engaged on this issue 
and its initial efforts to address the problem, suggest the 
other extreme of removing GSP benefits from Brazil at this 
time is neither warranted nor wise.  Post believes our 
positive bilateral engagement on the issue would evaporate in 
a backlash against USG imposed norms should we act in a 
punitive way at this juncture.  The ensuing conflict would 
produce little of value with the bilateral dialog likely 
shifting from improving copyright protection to GoB efforts 
to fight the \"unjust\" removal of GSP benefits, including 
perhaps a protest in the WTO.  Although some industries would 
no doubt complain to the GoB about the loss of trade 
preferences, it is unlikely the commercial impact on Brazil 
would be sufficient enough to force a change in GoB policy. 
We believe the mere threat of removing benefits creates much 
more positive pressure for change than the actual removal of 
benefits. 
 
9. (SBU) Given the coincidence in timing of the CPI\'s efforts 
and our GSP review, we have a rare opportunity to make 
headway with the GoB on an extremely sensitive issue.  So far 
the bilateral dialog has been constructive; we should act to 
maintain this positive momentum by not escalating the issue 
at this time.  For now, Post recommends Washington agencies 
extend the review to enable the USG and U.S. copyright 
industries to gauge the effectiveness of recent GoB actions 
and its commitment to sustained anti-piracy efforts for the 
future.  The extension should provide the GoB with a 
reasonable amount of time for formation of the council and 
for its formulation and implementation of a national plan 
while preserving the \"pressure\" implied in an ongoing review. 
 Embassy believes six to nine months may be required to see 
tangible effects on piracy in the country.  If at the end of 
that we do not see sufficient progress on IPR enforcement, 
then it will be time to turn towards more coercive measures. 
We also recommend that consideration be given to offering 
technical assistance, as warranted, to help the GoB advance 
its anti-piracy efforts.

SUBJECT: GOB Focuses on Key Projects to Help Close 
Infrastructure Deficit 
 
REF:  A) Brasilia 1087, B) Rio de Janeiro 1291 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary and Introduction.  With exports rapidly 
increasing, Brazil\'s transportation infrastructure is 
bursting at the seams.  The country\'s inefficient (and 
insufficient) ports, its deficient roads, and its decrepit 
rail network serve as bottlenecks to the timely dispatch of 
commercial cargo.  Well aware that past shortfalls in 
infrastructure investment are now resulting in greater 
costs and lost export opportunities, the GOB is now looking 
at how it can quickly expand its transport capacity.  Of 
the four road/port/rail projects at the top of the list, 
the GOB is currently contemplating moving forward with 
three of them through its planned public private 
partnership (PPP) regime.  Delays in the passage of the PPP 
legislation through congress have meant that these three 
projects could - at the earliest - only be opened for 
bidding by mid-2005.  The GOB also needs to decide how to 
account for potential liabilities arising from public 
sector PPP guarantees.  Notwithstanding Planning Ministry 
predictions of passage of the legislation within 30 days, 
this time-line is even further lengthened if congress 
continues to dawdle.  The export crops most affected by 
this infrastructure deficit are high-volume, low-margin 
bulk grains such as soybeans - the star performers in 
Brazil\'s current export boom.  End Summary and 
Introduction. 
 
2. (U)  With the Brazilian real competitively priced in the 
range of 2.8 - 3.2 to one USD, this year Brazil has been 
enjoying an export boom.  Exports, which the Ministry of 
Development, Industry, and Commerce had hoped would reach 
the USD 80 billion figure this calendar year, are now on 
track to reach over USD 90 billion.  Exports have increased 
across all categories, including primary, semi-manufactured 
and manufactured goods, although basic commodities (such as 
soybeans) have proven to be the star performers. 
Meanwhile, earlier GOB estimates of a 2004 trade balance of 
a USD 23 billion, have now been adjusted upwards to USD 32 
billion. 
 
3. (U)  Inadequate investment in public infrastructure, 
however, has left Brazil\'s transport infrastructure in a 
precarious state.  First, the relative lack of development 
of inland waterway transport in Brazil means that most of 
the country\'s export grains must move to port via truck, 
which comes out to about 3 times the cost of barge 
transport.  Second, three-quarters of Brazil\'s paved roads 
have deteriorating pavement, inadequate signs or access 
roads, or are improperly graded.  The country\'s railroads 
are in a similar state of disrepair, and bottlenecks at the 
country\'s principal maritime dispatch point - the Port of 
Santos - continue unabated.  Indeed, exporters of high- 
value items have resorted to expensive air-freight to 
transport their goods to foreign markets.  GOB figures show 
that in August 2004, the number of exports sent by air 
increased 9.2 percent over the year before.  Manufacturers 
are relying upon air transport to send items such as auto 
parts, cellular phone parts, and even cuts of beef. 
 
4. (SBU)  Ministry of Planning officials lament the 
country\'s lagging commitment over the past two decades to 
infrastructure investment.  The challenge, according to the 
Ministry\'s International Affairs Chief, Jose Carlos 
Miranda, is to reconcile the GOB\'s desire to expand public 
investment (to generate greater growth) with its desire to 
maintain a primary fiscal surplus (to maintain the 
confidence of the markets).   To resolve this dilemma, 
Miranda observed that the GOB has taken a pragmatic 
approach:  it will allocate budget monies to pressing 
public sector projects, it will encourage the private 
sector to move forward in cases where a project can be 
undertaken on a commercial basis, and through its public- 
private partnership program it will promote development of 
those projects that the private sector would not undertake 
without some form of public assistance. 
 
5. (SBU)  Translating theory into practice, however, has 
proven difficult.  Though the Railroad Revitalization Plan 
launched by the GOB in 2003 has sought to prioritize rail 
improvements, of the USD 20 million budgeted for this 
purpose this year only $15 million has been spent - a 
fraction of the amount needed to do the job.  The real 
engine responsible for the rail improvements the country 
has made has been the private sector, specifically the 
steel/mining conglomerates CVRD and CSN.  According to the 
leading daily \"O Estado de Sao Paulo,\" nearly all of the 
USD 360 million that was invested in rail in 2003 and the 
USD 285 million spent during the first half of 2004 
originated from the private sector.  By improving rail 
lines from their inland plants to the northern port of 
Itaqui (near Sao Luis in Maranhao state), CVRD and CSN hope 
to cut their transport costs significantly.  CVRD also has 
been responsible for the rehabilitation of the rail line 
connecting the Center-West and Minas Gerais with the 
burgeoning Port of Vitoria in Espirito Santo; the rail line 
is considered the cheapest, most modern, and most 
productive rail line and carries products such as steel, 
coal, and iron ore.  Meanwhile, concessions for private- 
sector road construction and maintenance in Brazil have 
largely been successful over the past 5 to 6 years, 
bringing significant improvements in road quality to the 
South and Southeast. 
 
6. (SBU)  Much the same story is true for the urgent USD 
207 million project to widen and pave BR-163, the 1,760 
kilometer highway linking Cuiaba in Mato Grosso state to 
the Amazon river port of Santarem.  Paving the current dirt 
(or when it rains, mud) sections of that highway, will 
allow soybean producers to export their 15.0 million ton 
crop north to the coast via the Amazon - as opposed to 
south via the Sao Paulo state port of Santos or the Parana 
port of Paranagua.  Estimates are that this northern route 
will cut USD 12 per ton in freight costs, a significant 
amount for a high-volume, low margin crop like soybeans. 
(By way of comparison, on average Brazil\'s soy farmers 
spend about USD 34 a ton on freight costs from many inland 
areas - about twice the amount spent by Argentine and U.S. 
producers.)   Miranda noted that the private sector (i.e., 
soy farmers) was the primary moving force behind 
implementation of this project, partly because of the gains 
they would make and partly because concerns about damaging 
the Amazon environment made it an issue difficult for the 
GOB to tackle.  The GOB is looking at the issue of 
sustainable development and its impact on the rate of 
deforestation along the proposed road very closely. 
 
7. (SBU)  Miranda saw PPPs as key where the private sector 
return on a project did not match the public sector 
benefits, i.e. - the positive externalities for the country 
as a whole were not considered.  Once the Senate passed the 
PPP legislation currently pending in Congress (and the 
Chamber of Deputies signed on to the Senate\'s changes), the 
PPP process would be ready to go.  Three projects that the 
Ministry thought would bring the most bang for the buck 
were queued up for quick approval, he said:  a) USD 170 
million in rail/road improvements to speed entry to the 
Port of Santos, b) USD 33 million in similar improvements 
to the Port of Sepetieba in Rio State, and c) USD 160 
million in rail construction to complement ongoing efforts 
on the feeder routes into Itaqui (along with the expansion 
of the Itaqui port itself, costing approximately USD 55 
million).  The GOB envisioned 50 to 60 percent private 
sector participation in these projects, with the remainder 
of the work to be done by the GOB itself.  More projects 
were on the drawing board, Miranda said, but these would 
have to wait for a second wave. 
 
8. (SBU) Miranda optimistically predicted that the PPP bill 
would be finalized soon after the second round of the 
municipal elections (October 31), and indeed Senate 
hearings on the draft legislation were set to resume the 
week of October 11.  However, Ministry of Planning Economic 
Advisor Damian Fiocca noted that given the need to issue 
regulations and set up an agency to run the PPP program, 
once the legislation was approved it would be six months - 
at a minimum - before the first project could move forward. 
 
9. (U)  Currently, negotiations are proceeding on the bill 
in the Senate, principally regarding how to account for any 
payments made by the GOB to concession operators in the 
out-years.  This issue is key given the potential for state 
guarantees to PPP projects to become large unaccounted 
liabilities.  According to the IMF Resident Representative 
(ResRep), the Ministry of Finance is convinced that the 
Fiscal Responsibility Law gives it the authority to enforce 
appropriate accounting of the government\'s liabilities at 
both the state and the federal level.  Unfortunately, no 
satisfactory standard to account for these PPP risks 
exists.  In the absence of an agreed standard, the IMF has 
proposed, according to the ResRep, that the federal and 
state budgets explicitly list all expected fiscal flows 
related to PPPs and the expected value of guarantees given 
to PPPs.  This would be an interim measure until such time 
as an accounting standard could be agreed to.  To date, 
however, Ministry of Finance has not yet ruled definitively 
on the accounting issue. 
 
10. (SBU)  Ministry of Planning officials note that in the 
end the bill will reflect a compromise between those in the 
GOB who would prefer that the government be responsible for 
investment in transportation infrastructure and those who 
see the need for a large private sector role.   Assuming 
that the bill passes, this struggle could prove to be an 
ongoing one as the two poles seek to have their point of 
view reflected in the make-up of the PPP agency, the 
eventual implementing regulations, and the design of the 
follow-on projects. 
 
11. (SBU)  Comment.  Whether the final version of the PPP 
program will offer interested private sector investors 
sufficient guarantees is an open question.  Given 
congressional opposition to providing PPP investors 
precedence over existing debt obligations, the GOB may have 
to resort to a guarantee fund to reassure participants that 
sufficient funds will be forthcoming for out-year payments. 
Some economic analysts here question whether all the 
internal to and fro on this issue within the Lula 
Administration and the governing coalition will prove to be 
worth the effort, noting that perhaps the time and 
political capital devoted to this could have been spent 
more wisely encouraging investment through the existing 
concession/licitation process.  Greater GOB attention to 
the basics - like reducing bureaucratic red tape, 
increasing the reliability of the judicial system, and 
better defining the regulatory rules of the road - likely 
would do the most, in the least amount of time, to promote 
greater investment.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  IN THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S OCTOBER 20 COURTESY CALL UPON GOB 
PLANNING MINISTER GUIDO MANTEGA, THE LATTER EMPHASIZED 
BRAZIL\'S NEED FOR INCREASED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
INVESTMENT.  MANTEGA FELT THAT BRAZIL WAS ON THE RIGHT 
TRACK AND THAT THE SUCCESS, TO DATE, OF THE GOB\'S 
MACROECONOMIC PROGRAM WOULD HELP PULL IN GREATER 
LEVELS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI).  MANTEGA 
PREDICTED THAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR THE BRAZILIAN 
CONGRESS WOULD PASS THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP 
LEGISLATION (CURRENTLY AWAITING A SENATE VOTE). 
MANTEGA\'S REMARKS COINCIDE WITH WHAT WE HAVE HEARD 
PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY FROM OTHER GOB ECONOMIC 
POLICYMAKERS, WHO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC 
GROWTH IN ATTRACTING FDI - AS OPPOSED TO NUTS AND 
BOLTS ITEMS SUCH AS BOLSTERING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, 
AND ESTABLISHING A STABLE, TRANSPARENT REGULATORY 
REGIME.  MANTEGA MAY BE IN WASHINGTON IN DECEMBER 2004 
OR JANUARY 2005 TO VISIT THE IDB, AND, IF SO, WOULD 
LIKE TO MEET WITH TREASURY SECRETARY SNOW OR U/S 
TAYLOR AT THAT TIME.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
2. (U) ON OCTOBER 20, AMBASSADOR PAID A COURTESY CALL 
UPON MINISTER OF PLANNING GUIDO MANTEGA.  PLANNING 
MINISTRY INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ADVISOR JOSE CARLOS 
MIRANDA ACCOMPANIED THE MINISTER; ECONCOUNS AND 
SPECASST SAT IN FOR THE U.S. SIDE. 
 
3. (SBU) MANTEGA OPENED THE MEETING NOTING THAT, AFTER 
THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF 2002 TO 
2003, BRAZIL WAS FINALLY ON THE RIGHT TRACK.  GDP 
GROWTH WAS EXPANDING, EXPORTS WERE AT RECORD LEVELS, 
AND INFLATION WAS IN CHECK.  AS A RESULT, THE 
FINANCIAL MARKETS IN PLACES LIKE NEW YORK, LONDON, AND 
FRANKFURT HELD PRESIDENT LULA IN HIGH REGARD - AS DID 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC.  MANTEGA FELT THAT ALL THIS GOOD 
ECONOMIC NEWS WOULD HELP ASSUAGE THE GOB ECONOMIC 
TEAM\'S PRINCIPAL WORRY:  I.E., FINDING A WAY TO 
STIMULATE BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT.  FOR IF 
THE GOB PROVED UNABLE TO RAISE THE CURRENT LOW RATE OF 
INVESTMENT, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
TO ACHIEVE, ON A SUSTAINED BASIS, THE 5 TO 6 PERCENT 
GDP GROWTH IT WAS SEEKING.  SPECIFICALLY, THE MINISTER 
NOTED, THE DEFICIT IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION 
INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY RAILROADS, HIGHWAYS, AND 
PORTS, WAS THREATENING TO BRAKE THE COUNTRY\'S RAPIDLY 
EXPANDING EXPORTS OF COMMODITY GOODS.  HAVING THE RAIL 
LINE INTO THE PORT OF SANTOS (BRAZIL\'S PRINCIPAL 
MARITIME DISPATCH POINT) TERMINATE 6 KMS PRIOR TO THE 
ACTUAL PORT TERMINAL WAS SOMETHING THE GOB COULD NO 
LONGER AFFORD. 
 
4. (SBU) THE MINISTER SAW THE DRAFT PUBLIC-PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIP LAW (PPP) AS ESSENTIAL TO ATTRACTING THE 
NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT.  THE GOB ASSISTANCE 
CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE PPP REGIME WILL STIMULATE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE PROJECTS WHICH THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE PURSUED, MANTEGA OBSERVED.  HE 
PREDICTED THAT CONGRESS WOULD ENACT THE BILL PRIOR TO 
THE END OF THE YEAR.  EMBASSY COMMENT:  THIS TIMETABLE 
COULD WELL SLIP.  END COMMENT. THE DELAY IN MOVING ON 
THE LEGISLATION TO DATE, MANTEGA SAID, WAS DUE TO THE 
FLOOD OF MEDIDAS PROVISORIAS WHICH WERE CURRENTLY ON 
CONGRESS\' PLATE (BY LAW, THESE ITEMS MOVE TO THE TOP 
OF THE AGENDA) AND THE ABSENCE OF SOME CONGRESSMEN WHO 
WERE OUT CAMPAIGNING FOR THE UPCOMING MUNICIPAL 
ELECTIONS. 
 
5. (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR QUERIED MANTEGA ABOUT A RECENT 
A.T. KEARNEY REPORT WHICH INDICATED THAT IN 2004 
BRAZIL DECLINED FROM NINTH TO SEVENTEENTH PLACE IN 
THAT FIRM\'S FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) CONFIDENCE 
INDEX.  THE MINISTER REPLIED THAT THIS REPORT WAS 
EXAGGERATED, AS THE COUNTRY HAD DONE MUCH TO GET ITS 
INTERNAL HOUSE IN ORDER.  THE LULA ADMINISTRATION HAS 
REIGNITED ECONOMIC GROWTH, REFORMED THE TAX REGIME, 
IMPROVED PUBLIC FINANCES, AND WORKED TO REDUCE 
CORRUPTION.  IN ADDITION, THE GOB HOPED TO OBTAIN 
PASSAGE OF A BILL REFORMING THE COUNTRY\'S BANKRUPTCY 
CODE.  THESE EFFORTS HAD PRODUCED RESULTS, MANTEGA 
DECLARED.  THE DEVELOPMENT BY FORD OF A SUCCESSFUL 
BRAZILIAN DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED SUV (THE ECOSPORT) 
SHOWED WHAT BRAZILIAN BUSINESS WAS CAPABLE OF.  WHAT 
WAS ESSENTIAL, MANTEGA CONCLUDED, WAS THAT IN SEEKING 
TO STIMULATE INVESTMENT, THE GOB AVOID THE MISTAKES 
MADE BY THE PREVIOUS CARDOSO GOVERNMENT WHEN IT 
PRIVATIZED ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT. THOUGH MANTEGA DID NOT SPECIFY, 
PRESUMABLY HE, LIKE MANY OTHER PT LEADERS, BELIEVES 
THAT THE CARDOSO GOVERNMENT\'S MISTAKE WAS ALLOWING 
PURCHASERS TOO MUCH LEEWAY IN RAISING ENERGY TARIFFS. 
HOWEVER, MANY PRIVATE SECTOR ANALYSTS WOULD ARGUE THAT 
THE GOB\'S \"MISTAKE\" WAS NOT PROVIDING CLEAR REGULATORY 
RULES OF THE ROAD PRIOR TO SELLING THESE PARASTATALS. 
END COMMENT. 
 
7. (U) IN CLOSING, MANTEGA NOTED THAT AS THE GOB\'S 
REPRESENTATIVE TO THE IDB, HE PLANNED TO BE IN 
WASHINGTON FOR MEETINGS IN EITHER DECEMBER 2004 OR 
JANUARY 2005.  DURING THAT TIME, HE HOPED TO MEET WITH 
TREASURY SECRETARY SNOW OR U/S TAYLOR.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, PINR, BR, Domestic Politics 
SUBJECT: HERZOG CASE REOPENS WOUNDS FROM BRAZIL\'S 
DICTATORSHIP 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  In 1975, during Brazil\'s military 
dictatorship, leftist journalist Vladimir Herzog died under 
suspicious circumstances in a government facility in Sao 
Paulo.  The regime classified his death as a suicide, but 
most believed he had been murdered, and Herzog became a case 
study for regime abuses.  Two weeks ago, Brasilia\'s daily 
paper \"Correio Brasiliense\" ran a story highlighted by leaked 
photos that apparently show a humiliated Herzog in his cell 
shortly before his death.  If accurate, the photos of his 
abuse would support the theory that he was murdered. 
Shockingly, the Brazilian Army responded with a statement 
legitimizing the measures of the dictatorship and dismissing 
the press coverage as a \"little attempt at revenge\". 
President Lula was outraged and the Army Chief quickly issued 
a better statement expressing remorse for Herzog\'s death.  In 
another twist, it then emerged that the man in at least two 
of the three photos was not Herzog at all, but a Canadian 
priest who ran afoul of the regime and was briefly detained 
in 1975.  The legacy of the Herzog case will be a broader 
discussion about how to handle the military archives from the 
dictatorship period, which are currently sealed for fifty 
years.  President Lula, mindful of the need for smooth 
relations with the military and the importance of moving 
forward with his policy agenda, is in no hurry to open the 
dictatorship\'s files.  He will leave the next steps to the 
Congress, courts, and public opinion.  END SUMMARY. 
 
HERZOG\'S DEATH AND THE FORGOTTEN FILES 
-------------------------------------- 
2. (U)  When he was detained by the military regime on 24 
October 1975, Vladimir Herzog was a member of the Brazilian 
Communist Party and Director of Journalism at \"TV Cultura\". 
He was taken for interrogation at a notorious regime facility 
in Sao Paulo, becoming one of about 3,000 political prisoners 
held at the time.  The next day, photos of his body were 
released --he had been hanged from his cell\'s window (the 
window is so low to the ground that Herzog\'s knees nearly 
touch the floor, generating immediate doubts about the 
hanging scenario).  Although the regime insisted Herzog had 
committed suicide, he was widely believed to have been 
tortured and murdered.  The Sao Paulo rabbi who presided over 
his funeral refused to bury Herzog in the cemetery\'s suicide 
section. 
 
3. (U) In 1997, twelve years after the return to civilian 
rule.  An intelligence officer who, even as late as 1995, was 
spying on leftist political parties, had a crisis of 
conscience.  He gathered up a stack of files from the 
military intelligence center and delivered them to the Human 
Rights Committee of the federal Chamber of Deputies, where 
they gathered dust until this month.  The Human Rights 
Committee is now reorganizing its archives, and the files 
resurfaced.  On 17 October 2004, in a splashy six-page 
spread, Brasilia\'s daily newspaper \"Correio Brasiliense\" ran 
three photos leaked by the committee that apparently show a 
nude and humiliated Vladimir Herzog, head in hands, sitting 
in his jail cell. 
 
MILITARY\'S SHOCKING FIRST RESPONSE 
---------------------------------- 
4. (U) The response by the military to the articles was 
nothing short of shocking in its defense of the military 
dictatorship: 
 
\"From the mid-1960s through the early 1970s\", reads the 
statement issued by the Army\'s Communications Center, \"there 
was a subversive movement in Brazil acting on orders from 
well-known centers of the International Communist Movement, 
planning to topple by force the legally constituted Brazilian 
government.  At the time the Brazilian Army, responding to 
popular demand, put together, along with the other armed 
forces and police forces, a pacification force that returned 
Brazil to normality.  The measures taken by the Legal Forces 
were a legitimate response to the violence of those who 
refused dialogue and opted for radicalism. ... The Movement 
of 1964 (i.e., the military coup), fruit of popular demand, 
created the conditions for building a new Brazil in an 
environment of peace and security.\" 
 
5. (U) \"The Ministry of Defense has insistently emphasized 
that there are no historical documents proving that deaths 
occurred during these operations --considering that the 
records of the intelligence activities from that time were 
destroyed in accordance with legal rulings. ... Media 
statements based on third parties who kept personal files are 
not the responsibility of the Armed Forces. ... With no 
change in our position or our conviction about what happened 
in that period, (we) consider this action (i.e. the \"Correio\" 
articles) a little attempt at revenge or to stimulate sterile 
discussions about past events, that lead to nothing.\" 
 
AND THE SECOND STATEMENT SOON AFTER 
----------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) The press, public, and President Lula --who was 
briefly jailed during the dictatorship-- were outraged by the 
Army\'s statement.  Lula called in DefMin Viegas, who 
explained that the statement had been released without his 
clearance.  Viegas called in Army Chief Gen. Francisco 
Albuquerque who quickly issued a second statement reading, 
\"The Brazilian Army laments the death of journalist Vladimir 
Herzog. ... I understand that the way in which this was 
handled was not appropriate, and that only the absence of a 
deeper internal discussion could allow the Army\'s 
Communication Center to issue a statement so out of touch 
with the current historical moment.\"  Viegas pronounced the 
case closed.  One rumor that was privately confirmed for us 
by DefMin Viegas\'s deputy, Fernando Abreu, was that the first 
statement was a boilerplate that the Army had used for years 
without incident or review.  Abreu labeled it \"stupidity\". 
 
WHO IS THE MAN IN THE PHOTOS? 
----------------------------- 
7. (U) The strange twists in the story did not stop.  A few 
days later, the press and GoB officials examining the three 
photos revealed that at least two of them were not of Herzog, 
but of Canadian priest Leopold D\'Astous, now retired in 
Canada, who lived in Brazil at the time and was briefly 
arrested for working with youth groups.  Herzog\'s widow 
admitted that she may have been hasty in confirming the 
identity in the photos, but she believes the third photo may 
yet be of her husband. 
 
COMMENT - WHAT TO DO WITH THE FILES? 
------------------------------------ 
8. (SBU) The legacy of the Herzog case is a discussion that 
is now getting underway over the fate of the military 
archives from the dictatorship period.  Most of the official 
files were sealed for fifty years by a decree of President 
Cardoso.  The official records specifically relating to the 
\"Battle of Araguaia\" (the bloody suppression of a communist 
movement in the interior of Para state) have, by all 
accounts, been completely destroyed, although bootleg copies 
made by Army officers involved in the operation have 
reportedly surfaced.  But many other files, including those 
relating to the treatment of political prisoners, still 
exist.  President Lula is in no hurry to open them, telling 
the service chiefs on October 24 that he supports keeping 
them sealed and urging the officers to cooperate with the 
Human Rights Committee should it hold hearings.  Lula is 
keenly aware that unsealing the archives would not only 
strain his relations with the military, it would also be a 
huge distraction from his policy agenda (\"This issue is now 
with the Human Rights Committee, the administration ought to 
concern itself with creating jobs and developing the 
country\", Lula told the officers).  The Chairman of the 
Chamber\'s Human Rights Committee, Mario Heringer (PDT-MG), 
has ordered the Committee\'s archives to be reviewed to see if 
there are any more explosive revelations, and he has called 
the intelligence officer who gave the files to the committee 
in 1997 to testify.  Meanwhile, press and pundits are 
offering a variety of opinions on how best to handle the 
archives in the longer-term. 
 
9. (SBU) While Lula and DefMin Viegas appeared satisfied by 
the second official statement issued by Army Chief 
Albuquerque, the contretemps over the statements suggests 
that there are still some pockets of \"old think\" in the 
officer corps --but there is no reason to view this as an 
institutional threat to democratic authority over the 
military.  Viegas\' relations with the service chiefs, already 
strained, have only worsened with the Herzog case.  And even 
beforehand, rumors had Viegas losing his job in Lula\'s next 
cabinet shuffle.  While the Army got a black eye from this 
affair, Lula seems ready to move on to other issues and leave 
the sweeping-up to others.

REF: STATE 228304 
 
1. (U) Econoffs delivered reftel points on reopening export 
agency credits to support Iraqi reconstruction to Piragibe 
Tarrago, Chief of the Foreign Ministry\'s Economic Department, 
in an October 27 meeting.  Tarrago said that Brazil would 
like to reestablish normal trade relations with Iraq, 
including reestablishing export credit lines, as soon as the 
political situation has stabilized.  While Brazil never broke 
diplomatic relations with Iraq, Tarrago noted, it does not 
envision reopening its Baghdad embassy until the security 
situation has improved.  The Brazilian Embassy in Amman will 
continue covering Iraq until then. 
 
2. (U) Brazil, Tarrago said, has been participating in Paris 
Club discussions of Iraqi debt.  He estimated Iraq\'s debt to 
Brazilian entities at $3 billion, about three quarters of 
which is owed to private creditors.  Much of this debt was 
trade finance or infrastructure project finance involving 
Brazilian firms.  Brazil\'s principal concern is that there be 
an \"equitable\" settlement, Tarrago affirmed.  It also was 
keeping an eye on the implications of any Paris Club 
treatment of Iraqi debt on the interests of private Brazilian 
holders of Iraqi debt. 
 
3. (SBU) Comment:  Tarrago did not link the reopening of 
export credit lines to Iraq to Paris Club treatment of 
outstanding Iraqi debt.  It was nevertheless clear that the 
GoB does not expect that the political situation in Iraq will 
be conducive to normalizing trade relations any time soon.

REF: A. BRASILIA 2447 
 
     B. BRASILIA 2051 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Bruce Williamson, Reasons 1.4 (b) and 
 (d). 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  The GOB economic braintrust is currently 
debating whether to follow up Brazil\'s current precautionary 
IMF Standby Agreement (SBA) when it expires in March 2005 
with another IMF program.  Based on the country\'s 
fundamentals, there appears to be little need for a follow-on 
program, as all expectations are that Brazil will not require 
balance-of-payments (BOP) support in 2005.  Many private 
analysts believe that the financial markets would look even 
more favorably upon Brazil if it were to graduate from IMF 
tutelage and maintain its responsible macroeconomic policies. 
 But, with the memory of contagion from the Asian and Russian 
financial crises still fresh, not to mention the 2002 crisis 
of confidence sparked by Lula\'s election, the GoB would like 
some form of insurance against unexpected shocks.  It has 
been pushing for IMF creation of a new contingency line of 
credit.  Brazil, however, has not convinced a majority of the 
IMF Board to support the idea.  Absent such a line of credit 
and given the positive economic outlook, the GoB seems 
disinclined to seek a follow-on SBA or other formal IMF 
monitoring for 2005.  While the GoB would face a political 
conundrum should economic winds shift and force it to seek a 
Fund program in the election year of 2006, Lula\'s proven 
economic pragmatism suggests he would bite the bullet in that 
eventuality.  End Summary. 
 
Little Economic Rationale 
------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Visiting Regional Treasury Representative and Emboff 
discussed the GoB\'s dance with the IMF over a follow-on to 
Brazil\'s current, precautionary, exceptional-access SBA 
during a series of conversations October 8-15 with government 
officials, private sector representatives, and IMF Resident 
Representative Max Alier (please protect).  Central Bank 
director for Economic Policy Afonso Bevilaqua pointed out 
that, judged solely on the economic merits, there is little 
case for a follow-on agreement.  Even using the Central 
Bank\'s conservative estimates, Brazil in 2005 should enjoy 
another BoP surplus, of about $10 billion.  (Note: private 
sector estimates are as high as $15 billion.)  This strong 
expected performance undermines the traditional BOP-support 
rationale for an IMF program.  Bevilaqua further argued that 
Brazil would build more market confidence by \"graduating\" 
from its IMF agreement while continuing to pursue responsible 
economic policies. 
 
Potential Benefits of Graduation 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The private sector, according to Nilson Teixeira of 
CSFB, has already adjusted to the reality of the Lula 
government\'s responsible policy agenda.  Given the lack of 
need for BOP support, he judged an IMF program \"irrelevant.\" 
Banco Pactual\'s Guilherme Bacha, by contrast, felt that 
graduating from the IMF program and continuing the same 
policies would significantly reduce Brazil\'s country risk. 
Bacha nevertheless did not expect that the market would react 
negatively to negotiation of a new program.  Former Central 
Bank President Arminio Fraga, now with Gavea Investments, 
likewise argued that Brazil would gain more in the market\'s 
eyes from pursuing responsible policies without IMF tutelage. 
 
GoB Wants Insurance 
------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) While the GoB,s official line is that there is no 
need to decide about a follow-on program before March 2005, 
when the current program expires, the GoB appears to be 
weighing two alternatives: either no program (so-called 
graduation) or a new type of contingent facility.   For the 
GOB, ideally, a new contingent line for \"good performers\" 
would combine large, automatic access to IMF resources in a 
crisis with minimal conditionality.  Finance Ministry 
International Secretary Luiz Pereira observed that a new line 
of credit for countries with good policy records would 
mitigate risks of contagion and other external shocks, 
although such a facility would need a decent level of 
automatically-available resources to be credible with the 
market.  He believed the negotiation of an SBA would be too 
slow in a crisis, and that this made the case for a facility 
that granted quick access, followed up by renewed IMF 
monitoring once it was activated.  Pereira acknowledged it 
might be tricky to get the level of eligibility criteria 
right:  too little risked moral hazard, while too much risked 
a repetition of the experience of the now-defunct Contingency 
Credit Line (CCL), which was never used.  Pereira claimed 
\"sympathy\" from France and Russia for Brazil\'s position that 
this sort of facility should be part of the international 
financial architecture.  He further stated there would be 
\"little demand\" for a policy-monitoring program that did not 
carry access to fund resources, implying the GoB would opt 
for no program at all absent the creation of a new contingent 
line.  Treasury Secretary Levy added that the latest proposal 
from IMF staff outlining how such a new line of credit would 
work was not what the GoB had envisioned and unlikely to 
prove effective. 
 
5. (U) Underlying Pereira\'s comments is Brazil\'s experience 
with international financial markets since 1998, when 
contagion from the Asian financial crisis forced it to seek 
an IMF SBA.  Brazil has been on SBAs since then, and these 
facilities have helped it deal with financial turmoil after 
the Russian financial crisis and the 2002 crisis of 
confidence sparked by uncertainty over the policy course that 
then-probable presidential election winner Lula da Silva 
would implement.  The $30 billion 2002 SBA was the IMF\'s 
single largest program, and granted Brazil exceptional access 
to IMF financing.  (Note: Exceptional access carries an 
expectation of more intensive post-program monitoring.) 
 
ResRep: GoB Bluffing 
-------------------- 
 
6. (C) IMF ResRep Alier called the GoB\'s 
new-facility-or-nothing position a \"bluff.\"  The GoB\'s real 
problem, he argued, is how to deal with the possibility that 
economic circumstances would require it to seek IMF financing 
during the election year of 2006.  It would be politically 
problematic for the Lula administration to \"kiss the Fund 
good-bye\" in 2005 and then be forced to seek an IMF program 
in 2006.  The GoB, he said, is still weighing that potential 
political loss against the (less theoretical) gains of 
graduating from the current SBA in 2005.  Alier argued that 
in the absence of an IMF program, the GoB should take the 
step of releasing the IMF staff reports generated during 
routine monitoring visits next year as a way to reassure the 
markets.  The GoB has always elected to keep IMF staff 
reports confidential. 
 
7. (C) Addressing the specifics of Brazil\'s arguments for a 
new contingent line with high levels of automatic access, 
Alier stated that the Lula Administration financial team, 
while tough negotiators, always fulfilled their commitments. 
This made their case for a new line of credit with large, 
automatic access to IMF resources more credible.  From the 
institutional point of view, however, it made little sense 
for the Fund to create a new facility tailored to the current 
reality of one IMF client.  Moreover, he added, there was no 
guarantee that future GoBs would be as reliable as the 
current one. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) The politics of a follow-on program are doubtless more 
complex than the economics.  It seems a bit hasty, however, 
to dismiss the GoB\'s current all-or-nothing position on a 
follow-on IMF program as a bluff.  Given the low probability 
that the IMF Board will create a new contingent facility per 
the GoB,s wishes, the GoB\'s real choices are between 
graduation, a follow-on, precautionary SBA or a 
staff-monitored program.  This last option is unpalatable as 
it combines all of the political drawbacks of formal IMF 
policy monitoring with a complete lack of access to IMF 
financing.  With regard to an SBA, the GoB has little to gain 
with the markets at this juncture for signing on to a program 
unwarranted by the economic realities.  It would further face 
the downside of potentially being lumped in with 
poor-performing countries that require prolonged access to 
Fund resources.  That leaves graduation as the GoB\'s most 
likely choice, and with it the opportunity for the GoB to 
better establish its policy credentials with the market. 
Many in the market are also of the view that Brazil has an 
implicit contingency line from the IMF, as long as it pursues 
its current policy mix.  Alier has a point that the GoB would 
pay a political price for graduating in 2005 if a reversal of 
economic fortunes forced it to seek another IMF program in 
2006, when Lula would be running for reelection.  But, Lula\'s 
pragmatism and consistent willingness to make tough economic 
decisions and justify them with the electorate mitigates this 
concern.

1.  (SBU)  According to Ministry of External Relations (MRE) 
Africa Division Chief Joao Inacio Oswaldo Padilha, an 
extraordinary meeting of the Community of Portuguese Language 
Countries (CPLP) will be held 2 November in Lisbon to discuss 
the deteriorating political and economic situation in Guinea 
Bissau. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim is slated to 
attend. In its deliberations, Padilha said, the CPLP will 
review ways to coordinate with the African Union and ECOWAS 
on initiatives to address the Guinea Bissau crisis. It will 
also discuss how to increase UNSC attention to Guinea Bissau. 
Padilha inicated he himself will be traveling to Bissau later 
in the week. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Although Padilha described as \"pointless\" the 
sending of troops to Guinea Bissau at this time, he believed 
a significant PKO deployment was almost inevitable.  Through 
the extraordinary meeting in Lisbon and in recent statements 
at the UNSC, Brazil hoped to demonstrate its leadership 
within the CPLP and its commitment to raising the profile of 
the Guinea Bissau crisis. The first order of UNSC business, 
Padilha noted, would be for a renewal of UNOGBIS, whose 
mandate expires in December, and revision of the TOR for its 
mission -- points raised with poloff days earlier by 
Padilha\'s counterpart in MRE\'s United Nations Division 
(reftel).  He also confirmed that President Lula would almost 
assuredly visit Guinea Bissau during his next visit to 
Africa, most likely during the first half of 2005. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Comment: This is the second time in four days that 
a MRE official has raised Guinea Bissau with poloff. The MRE 
appears eager to get USG attention. Both diplomats provided 
to poloff a strong sense that Brazil fears the USG will 
downplay or overlook Guinea Bissau in light of other world 
events.

1. SUMMARY.  Brazil\'s 2004 election cycle has come to an end. 
 With second-round runoffs in 43 cities on October 31, 
Brazilians have elected mayors and city councils in all 5,562 
municipalities nationwide.  The most closely-watched races 
went as expected: Jose Serra (PSDB) defeated incumbent Marta 
Suplicy (PT) in Sao Paulo; while Jose Fogaca (PPS) upended 
the PT machine in Porto Alegre.  Elsewhere, a broad coalition 
crushed the PFL machine in Salvador; and PT a leftist 
completed her unlikely path to city hall in Fortaleza. 
Overall these elections continue the trend that began in the 
mid-1990s and accelerated with the 2002 national elections: 
the emergence of Lula\'s PT and the PSDB of former-President 
Cardoso as the two strongest national parties, with the PMDB 
and PFL trying to hold their ground.  These were local 
elections, with coalitions often contrary to those at the 
national level, and with local issues and personalities on 
display.  As such, they offer uncertain predictions, at best, 
for the 2006 national elections and beyond.  Yet it seems 
likely that the PT and PSDB will continue to be the primary 
wellsprings for national-level politics in the coming years, 
while other parties large and small will continue to wield 
significant regional influence.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2004 ELECTIONS TURN OUT WELL FOR PT AND PSDB 
-------------------------------------------- 
2.  The second-round runoffs in Brazil\'s municipal elections 
were held on October 31.  Of Brazil\'s 5,562 municipalities, 
only those with populations greater than 200,000 are eligible 
for runoffs (smaller towns use plurality voting).  Thus 43 
elections were held this week in state capitals and other key 
cities.  In Sao Paulo, Jose Serra (PSDB -Brazilian Social 
Democratic Party), who lost to Lula in the 2002 presidential 
race, defeated incumbent Marta Suplicy (PT -Workers\' Party). 
In Porto Alegre, Jose Fogaca (PPS -Popular Socialist Party) 
defeated PT leftist Raul Pont, ending the PT\'s sixteen-year 
run in city hall (see Sao Paulo septel for details on the 
southern states).  In Salvador, the PFL (Liberal Front Party) 
machine of Antonio Carlos Magalhaes suffered a crushing 
defeat as its candidate, Senator Cesar Borges, was thrashed 
by the PDT\'s (Democratic Labor Party) Joao Henrique, who led 
a broad oppositionist coalition.  In Fortaleza, PT leftist 
Luizianne Lins defeated PFL conservative Moroni Torgan. 
Lins\' victory was improbable because the PT national party 
supported another candidate in the first round.  And in 
Manaus, Serafim Correa (PSB) upset old-style politico 
Amazonino Mendes (PFL). 
 
3.  The overall national trend of this election cycle was the 
continued emergence of President Lula\'s PT and the opposition 
PSDB as the strongest parties nationwide, followed by the two 
other traditional powerhouses: the centrist PMDB (Party of 
the Brazilian Democratic Movement) and the conservative PFL. 
These four are the only parties to win over 10 million votes 
nationwide.  But in certain areas and depending on local 
circumstances, personalities, and coalitions, the smaller 
parties --such as the PPS and the communist PCdoB-- also did 
well.  At the national level, the PMDB is a member of the 
PT\'s governing coalition, while the PSDB and PFL form the 
bulk of the opposition. 
 
RESULTS IN THE STATE CAPITALS 
----------------------------- 
4.  Fifteen of Brazil\'s 26 state capitals held runoff 
elections on October 31.  These are key races by definition 
because the mayor of the capital generally has influence 
second only to the state governor in terms of party 
consolidation, pork distribution, and policy implementation. 
Results of the state capital races are as follows: 
 
SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST: 
 
- Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo:  Jose Serra (PSDB) defeated incumbent 
Marta Suplicy (PT), 55-45%, in the nation\'s highest-profile 
race. 
- Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul: Jose Fogaca (PPS) led a 
broad coalition in defeating Raul Pont (PT), 53-47%.  The PT 
had held city hall for sixteen years. 
- Curitiba, Parana: Beto Richa (PSDB) defeated Angelo Vanhoni 
(PT), 55-45%. 
- Florianopolis, Santa Catarina: Dario Berger (PSDB) defeated 
Chico Assis (PP), 58-42%. 
- Vitoria, Espirito Santo: Joao Coser (PT) crushed Cesar 
Colnago (PSDB), 58-42%. 
 
NORTHEAST: 
 
- Salvador, Bahia:  State Deputy Joao Henrique (PDT) led a 
broad coalition in knocking off the PFL machine\'s candidate, 
Senator Cesar Borges, 75-25%.  The magnitude of this loss 
suggests it may be the beginning of the end for PFL strongman 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who continues to hold many city 
halls in the interior. 
- Fortaleza, Ceara: PT leftist Luizianne Lins got 
second-round support from the PT national party and the local 
PSDB machine to defeat Moroni Torgan (PFL), 56-44%.  The PT 
national party did not support Lins\' longshot candidacy in 
the first round. 
- Natal, Rio Grande do Norte:  Incumbent Carlos Eduardo (PSB) 
barely held off Luiz Almir (PSDB), 52-48%. 
- Maceio, Alagoas: Cicero Almeida (PDT) defeated Alberto 
Sexta-Feira (PSB), 57-43%. 
- Teresina, Piaui: Silvio Mendes (PSDB) defeated Adalgisa 
Moraes Souza (PMDB), wife of Lula-baiting Senator Mao Santa 
(PMDB), 58-42%. 
 
NORTH AND CENTER-WEST: 
 
- Manaus, Amazonas:  The PSB\'s Serafim Correa scored a 
stunning upset over Amazonino Mendes (PFL), a dinosaur who 
had served two terms each as mayor and governor, 52-48%. 
Mendes ran 15 points ahead of Correa in the first round. 
- Goiania, Goias: Another old-style politico, Iris Rezende 
(PMDB), knocked off PT incumbent Pedro Wilson in the state 
that surrounds Brasilia, 57-43%. 
- Porto Velho, Rondonia: City Council President Roberto 
Sobrinho (PT) defeated Dr. Mauro Nazif (PSB), 54-46%. 
- Cuiaba, Mato Grosso: In the city\'s first-ever runoff, 
Wilson Santos (PSDB) defeated Alexandre Cesar (PT), 53-47%. 
- Belem, Para: Senator Duciomar Costa (PTB) defeated Senator 
Ana Julia Carepa (PT), 58-42%. 
 
RESULTS IN OTHER KEY CITIES 
--------------------------- 
5. Some key races that were not capital cities: 
 
- Contagem, Minas Gerais: PT challenger Marilia Campos 
knocked off PSDB Ademir Lucas, 60-40%.  Coupled with the PT\'s 
first-round win in state capital Belo Horizonte, this sets up 
Minas Gerais along with Sao Paulo as future PSDB/PT 
battlegrounds. 
 
- Campos, Rio de Janeiro.  A tumultuous campaign in the 
hometown of presidential pretender Anthony Garotinho (ref B) 
saw dirty tricks and 500 army troops keeping the peace on 
election day.  Garotinho\'s PMDB candidate, Geraldo Pudim, was 
defeated, 55-45%, by Carlos Campista (PDT) who allied an 
array of anti-Garotinho forces. 
 
- Nova Iguacu, Rio de Janeiro:  PT upstart Lindberg Farias 
has established a PT foothold in a state where the party is 
weak by knocking off PMDB incumbent (and Garotinho machine 
candidate) Mario Marques, 58-42%. 
 
PARTY READOUT 
------------- 
6.  These were local elections, so their prophetic value for 
the 2006 presidential and gubernatorial races is limited. 
But in broad strokes they tend to confirm the widely-held 
assumption that heading into the 2006 elections Lula\'s PT, 
allied with an assortment of mostly left-of-center parties, 
will face the PSDB-led opposition bloc, both in the 
presidential race and the Sao Paulo gubernatorial race.  In 
terms of the dynamics of the big four parties: 
 
- the PT won 16.3 million votes nationwide in this cycle and 
is still a big-city labor-based party that is expanding in 
many interior areas and is the fastest-growing party overall. 
 Nationwide it elected 174 mayors in 2000 and 412 this year. 
The loss of Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre is a deep 
disappointment to party leaders. 
 
- the PSDB of former-President Cardoso is in opposition to 
the PT.  It won 15.7 million votes nationwide and has 
powerful state-based machines in a broad arc from Sao Paulo 
and Minas through Tocantins to Piaui and Ceara in the 
northeast.  Nationwide it elected 987 mayors in 2000 and 871 
this year. 
 
- the PMDB won 14.2 million votes nationwide but does not 
fare well in big cities and has no national stars.  It has 
dominant machines in the three southern states, has 
Garotinho\'s wounded machine in Rio, and has traditional 
\"coronels\" in the northeast.  The party is in Lula\'s 
coalition at the federal level, but will ally with any party 
at the local level.  Nationwide it elected 1,253 mayors in 
2000 and 1,057 this year. 
 
- the PFL is a conservative party that polled 11.3 million 
votes nationwide.  It is more in the way of an alliance of 
\"coronels\" (some say dinosaurs) in a number of distinct 
strongholds.  It polls well in the northeast, and has 
redoubts in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Santa Catarina. 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes\' machine still has a hammerlock on 
the interior of Bahia but was soundly whipped by a 
left-of-center coalition in the state capital, Salvador. 
Nationwide the PFL won 1,027 mayors in 2000 and 790 this year. 
 
COMMENT - FEW SUPRISES 
---------------------- 
7.  The second round runoffs went mostly as expected.  The 
PT\'s losses in Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre were predicted by 
the polls for several weeks.  The two real surprises were the 
magnitude of the defeat suffered by the Magalhaes\' PFL 
candidate in Salvador (75-25%), and the upset victory of 
Serafim Correa in Manaus over another old-timer, Amazonino 
Mendes.  Both results point to a subtext that was commented 
on in the 2002 elections and continued this month:  many of 
the old machines and dinosaurs are showing weakness.  This 
trend is far from consolidated, and new coronels (such as 
Garotinho) are always eager to replace the old.  One 
columnist sees this trend as a healthy strengthening of 
Brazil\'s two-decade old democracy, with voters increasingly 
looking for competence and integrity instead of voting at the 
instructions of the local machine.  If this trend continues, 
it will be good news for all Brazilians.

1. (SBU) INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY:  In an October 15, 2004 
meeting with poloff, a Brazilian Ministry of Labor (MOL) 
Inspection Counselor agreed with recent press reports that 
finger local agricultural magnates in the January 28, 2004 
assassination of three MOL labor inspectors and their driver 
near the rural city of Unai, Minas Gerais (reftels). 
Stepping beyond views expressed by the media, MOL Inspection 
Counselor Marcelo Campos speculated that tax evasion could 
have been the principal motive, since relatively low 
labor-related fines were hardly worth a crime of this scale. 
When separately interviewed by poloffs on October 25, 2004 
the Labor Inspector responsible for Unai was more 
circumspect, characterizing the evidence in the case to date 
as \"circumstantial.\"  Despite her denials and repeated 
professions of faith in higher powers, poloffs sensed that 
fear and intimidation played a role in her evasiveness.  The 
major suspects in the killings are currently in custody and 
awaiting trial in the state capital of Belo Horizonte.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
TAX EVASION A POTENTIAL MOTIVE? 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) In an October 15, 2004 meeting in Brasilia, 
Ministry of Labor (MOL) Inspection Counselor Marcelo Campos 
shared his views about the murder of three MOL inspectors and 
their driver in January 2004.  The four were ambushed in 
their car on a rural road in western Minas Gerais state, near 
the small town of Unai.  Campos concurred with recent 
indictments that placed responsibility for the killings on 
local Unai agriculture magnate Noberto Manica, a longtime 
violator of Brazilian labor laws.  An indictment has also 
been issued against his brother Anterio, who was recently 
elected mayor of Unai in spite of his bad press. 
Characterizing the Unai region as \"lawless,\" Campos was 
unflinching in his belief that Norberto Manica was guilty and 
asserted that the government possessed \"robust proof\" to that 
effect. Going beyond all previously released information, 
Campos speculated that Manica feared the inspectors would 
discover tax evasion in which penalties would far exceed 
fines levied for labor violations. 
 
3.  (SBU) According to Campos, the murder case is currently 
being handled by a federal court in Belo Horizonte, the state 
capital.  Eight indictments have already been issued against 
Noberto Manica, the alleged triggermen, and their 
accomplices.  The suspects (save Anterio Manica) await trial 
at a detention facility in Belo Horizonte.  As an elected 
official, Anterio Manica will be tried by the federal 
Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia.  He was recently freed 
pending further investigation concerning the scope of his 
involvement. 
 
EVASIVENESS AND FEAR 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Unlike Campos, MOL Chief Inspector in charge of the 
region (including Unai) Dalia Maria Chaves Ulhoa was evasive 
and offered little substantive information about the case 
when interviewed on October 25, 2004 in her Paracatu office. 
Paracatu is a small town that sits approximately 90 km away 
from Uani in rural Minas Gerais.  When asked whether tax 
evasion could have prompted the killings, Ulhoa instead 
declared that a \"lack of love and understanding\" along with a 
\"capital-labor mismatch\" were the causes.  Ulhoa acknowledged 
that she herself was a suspect in the investigation and 
emphatically dismissed the accusation as \"slander.\"  Pressed 
for more information, Ulhoa emphasized her faith in divine 
forces and evaded any reference to the pertinent facts of the 
case.  The Labor Inspector admitted she had received death 
threats and now traveled to Unai only with police escort. 
Denying she was personally afraid, Ulhoa asserted that her 
faith kept her going. 
 
5.  (SBU) COMMENT: Despite Chief Inspector Ulhoa\'s 
professions of faith, her seeming unwillingness to provide 
direct answers suggests fear -- in sharp contrast with the 
Brasilia-based Campos, whose distance from agricultural 
magnates in Unai granted him the ability to speak frankly. 
Federal jurisdiction over the case has allowed it to come 
closer to resolution by removing it from the \"lawless\" 
hinterlands where, as poloffs observed, fear often trumps 
justice.  END COMMENT

ECONOMY EXPANDS 
 
REF:  Brasilia 2447 
 
1. (SBU) Summary and Introduction.  In recent 
months, the macroeconomic picture for Brazil has 
been especially bright.  Growth has been strong, 
inflation has remained in check, exports have 
increased sharply, and the trade balance and the 
current account (both positive) have come in 
higher than expected.  This good news, however, 
masks a disturbing trend.  Per capita income 
growth for 2004 is likely to be anemic (around 
0.4 percent), and unemployment, while declining 
slightly, remains at historically high levels. 
This small increase in per capita income growth 
comes in the wake of a whopping 7.4 percent 
decrease in real wages per worker in 2003. 
Indeed, comparing 2003 figures to those in 1996, 
real wages per worker were nearly 20 percent less 
(852 Brazilian reais versus 692) and unemployment 
was more than 100 percent higher.  It appears 
that the lower middle class has borne the brunt 
of this wage and employment squeeze.  There is 
hope that improvements in these indicators during 
2004 might signal the end of this long slide, 
particularly if current economic growth is 
sustained into the medium term.  End Summary and 
Introduction. 
 
2. (U) With GDP growth predicted to come in at 
4.5 to 4.7 percent this year (as opposed to -0.2 
percent in 2003), the GOB economic team is 
receiving plaudits from both industry and the 
market for its ability to restart economic 
growth.  The country\'s economic expansion has 
brought advances on all fronts:  2004 exports are 
predicted to reach a record high (USD 90 billion, 
up from 73 billion the previous year), and the 
trade balance, originally forecast at USD 23 
billion for 2004, should fall somewhere between 
the USD 30 and 32 billion level.  Meanwhile, the 
current account is expected to be positive (USD 
9.5 billion) and consumer prices remain under 
control (forecast to rise 7.16 percent for 2004). 
This positive economic news has enthused market 
risk watchers.  Moody\'s, Standard & Poor\'s and 
Fitch\'s have all raised their rating of Brazilian 
debt, with GOB bond issues now 3 to 4 categories 
below investment grade. 
 
3. (U) Notwithstanding the GOB\'s achievements 
this year on the growth, trade, and inflation 
fronts, these advances come against the 
background of mid-term reductions in both real 
wages per worker and employment.  According to 
data from the Brazilian Institute for Geography 
and Statistics for calendar year 2003, compared 
to 1996 (the tail end of the Plano Real boom) 
real wages per worker declined from R$ 852 per 
month to $R 692 per month - nearly 20 percent. 
Meanwhile, unemployment, again according to IBGE 
figures, rose from 5.4 percent to 12.3 percent 
during this period (although methodological 
changes for measuring job losses put in place in 
2002 distort this comparison).  The drop in real 
wages was particularly sharp during the first 
year of the Lula government, 2002 to 2003, when 
this figure dropped a whopping 7.4 percent. 
(During this same time-frame, unemployment rose 
from 11.7 percent to 12.3 percent.)  Even with 
the economy currently in full recovery mode, post 
estimates that for 2004 real income per worker 
will likely only rise in the 0.3 to 0.4 percent 
range - hardly sufficient to make much of a dent 
in the decline over the past 8 years. 
 
4. (SBU) In a recent conversation with EconCouns, 
ECLAC economist Carlos Mussi offered an 
explanation for the drop in wages/employment 
between 1996 and 2003.  In 1996, he opined, 
though the economy\'s macro numbers were good, in 
reality the over-valued exchange rate meant that 
growth was unsustainable.  With the real trading 
more or less on par with the dollar Brazilian 
consumers had artificially enhanced purchasing 
power.  This fed increases in imports, which 
combined with the difficulty exporters had in 
selling their products overseas, created current 
account problems.  The GOB\'s response - sky-high 
interest rates - led to stagnant growth and 
higher unemployment.  The excess of number of job 
seekers allowed employers to hold the line on 
salaries, and, in some industries (such as retail 
banking) even cut pay.  Workers were hit with yet 
another body blow when consumer prices increased 
(7.7 percent in 2001, 12.5 percent in 2002, and 
9.3 percent in 2003), further eroding their 
incomes.  The good news, Mussi declared, was that 
even though workers were less well off today than 
they were in 1996, with all indicators in balance 
now at least the economy has a chance to 
experience sustainable long-term growth.  While 
the real wage and unemployment numbers were 
better in 1996, the disequilibrium in the economy 
then doomed the country to a start-stop pattern 
in terms of expansion. 
 
5. (SBU) Mussi felt that the middle-class has 
borne the brunt of the wage and employment 
squeeze, and IBGE data appear to confirm this. 
Unemployment rates remain high in the major 
metropolitan centers where the middle class is 
concentrated (for September 2004, 8.8% in Rio and 
11.7% in Sao Paulo).  While as a whole real wages 
per worker sank 7.4 percent between 2002 and 
2003, for the top half of the population wages 
declined 8 percent - as opposed to a mere 4.2 
percent for the bottom half.  Indeed, between 
2002 and 2003 workers at the bottom of the scale 
earning between one and two monthly minimum 
salaries (at that time, 240 to 480 reais) 
experienced no real wage losses at all.  Comment. 
While Mussi did not explicitly address this 
point, the rise in unemployment between 1996 and 
2003 also highlights the difficulties of small 
and medium-sized enterprises in generating job 
growth.  With middle and working-class incomes 
being squeezed, entrepreneurs with small and 
medium-sized enterprises who normally might have 
devoted their disposable funds to investment 
found that they had precious little to put back 
into the businesses.  The result:  stagnant 
growth in employment generation. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment Continued.  Nevertheless, there 
are a couple of encouraging notes in this tableau 
of statistics.  The first is that the still- 
evolving social safety net for the poor helped 
keep them from losing any ground during this 
period of sliding incomes among the middle 
classes.  The second observation, although not 
yet sustained into the longer term, is that the 
slide in real incomes looks to have halted in 
2004.  There is hope, given the more sustainable 
policy mix in 2004 vs. 1996 (i.e., floating 
exchange rate coupled with responsible fiscal and 
monetary management and healthy external 
accounts) that the Brazilian middle class will 
continue to see real income gains. Current GDP 
growth is more sustainable -- albeit at more 
moderate rates than in 2004.  Realizing that 
goal, however, will require continued GOB focus 
on the microeconomic and structural reform agenda 
necessary to increase both investment and 
productivity.

1.  (SBU)  Reacting to press reports concerning preliminary 
IAEA approval to Brazil\'s proposed inspection regime at the 
Resende nuclear enrichment facility, Ministry of External 
Relations (MRE) Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies (DDS) 
Division Chief Santiago Mourao acknowledged that the reports 
sounded correct, although to his knowledge the GOB had yet to 
receive a formal reply from the IAEA approving the inspection 
regime. He anticipated such a response shortly. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Mourao again reiterated the routine and technical 
nature of the pending agreement on Resende, reminding poloff 
that Brazil already had IAEA safeguards agreements on 35 
other domestic nuclear facilities.  Many of the very 
technical issues at Resende, Mourao confessed, were 
understandable only by the experts.  Following months of 
intensive negotiations, the October IAEA visit to Resende, he 
understood, dealt primarily with mundane technical matters. 
Despite the overwhelming political attention, the GOB and the 
IAEA officials involved with the process were experienced 
enough to know how to reach closure.  Unfortunately, costs 
associated with such IAEA inspections have gone up 
substantially in recent years -- a problem both the GOB and 
the Agency recognized and are seeking to address, Mourao 
noted.

(B)(D) 
 
1. (C) Summary. Brazilian Minister of Defense Jose Viegas has 
presented his letter of resignation to President Lula da 
Silva, according to a 4 November Defense Ministry 
announcement.  Vice President Jose Alencar will formally take 
over the defense ministry portfolio on 8 November (Minister 
Viegas retains authority until that date).  A senior MOD 
official confirmed that the resignation came as a result of 
months of tensions and disagreements between Viegas and 
senior military commanders over military pensions and other 
institutional problems, culminating in the recent Herzog case 
(see reftel), in which senior army officials had not cleared 
with Viegas a controversial communiqu concerning human 
rights abuses during Brazil\'s military era.  Viegas has been 
an effective interlocutor with the USG on key issues, notably 
implementation of Brazil\'s air bridge denial (shootdown) 
program against aerial narcotrafficking.  Mission does not 
view this development as an indication that Brazil\'s armed 
forces are restive and challenging civilian authority, even 
though Viegas\' tenure will not be remembered for reinforcing 
the stature and effectiveness of the civilian MOD. It also 
remains to be seen how his successor will handle challenging 
issues, such as shootdown, Brazil\'s leadership of MINUSTAH in 
Haiti or complex civil aviation matters.  End summary. 
 
2. (U)  Brazilian Minister of Defense Jose Viegas has 
presented his letter of resignation to President Lula da 
Silva, according to a 4 November Defense Ministry 
announcement.  Vice President Jose Alencar will formally take 
over the defense ministry portfolio on 8 November, while 
retaining his duties as vice president. No official reason 
was offered for the resignation in the announcement, but 
there has been media speculation for several months that 
Viegas might depart the ministry soon after Brazil\'s October 
municipal elections. 
 
3. (C) PolCouns spoke on 4 November with Fernando Abreu, 
Viegas\' chief of staff.  Abreu confirmed that Viegas\' recent 
embarrassment in the Herzog case (see reftel) had been the 
\"gota da agua\" (\"last drop of water,\" a Portuguese colloquial 
equivalent for \"straw that broke the camel\'s back\"), 
following months of tensions and disagreements between Viegas 
and senior military commanders over military pensions, 
budgets and other institutional problems. In the Herzog case, 
the release of a truculent communiqu by the Brazilian army 
that appeared to justify human rights abuses during the 
military era in Brazil, and which had not been cleared by 
Viegas, pointed up his continued difficulty in establishing 
coordination and authority with the armed services.  Abreu 
told PolCouns that the army commander, with whom Viegas has 
had previous difficulties, should have resigned \"as a matter 
of honor,\" and that his continuation as force commander made 
Viegas\' remaining as minister unviable. 
 
4. (C) Abreu said that the appointment of Alencar is \"a good 
solution\" and he opined that Alencar may retain the defense 
portfolio indefinitely (but see para 7 below). He did not 
know whether Alencar would physically spend most of his time 
at the MOD or in the vice presidency.  Abreu also confirmed 
speculation that Viegas, a career diplomat, would be posted 
as Brazil\'s Ambassador in Madrid once the GOB receives 
agrement. 
 
5. (C) During the transition period, Abreu said it is 
possible that Viegas, working out of the foreign ministry, 
may be available to work with the USG on resolving the final 
issues in the bilateral effort to revise the 2000 Brazil-U.S. 
Technology Safeguards Agreement on participation of U.S. 
firms in commercial space launches at Brazil\'s Alcantara 
spaceport.  Abreu and PolCouns agreed that the issue is 
well-advanced with good potential for a successful 
resolution, 
 
6. (C) During a lunch at the Ambassador\'s residence on 4 
November, PolCouns also discussed Viegas\' resignation with 
Aldo Rebelo, Lula\'s Minister for Political Coordination. 
Rebelo opined that the Viegas resignation \"had been 
predictable for some time\" owing to the tensions between the 
minister and the senior levels of the armed forces.  Rebelo 
said that Viegas had \"performed admirably\" in many of his 
duties, and he noted specifically Viegas\' successful effort 
with the USG on the shootdown issue. 
 
7. (C) But Rebelo, who was formerly chair of the foreign 
affairs and defense committee in Brazil\'s chamber of 
deputies, said Viegas\' tenure as DefMin had personified \"a 
clash of cultures\" between two of Brazil\'s oldest 
institutions -- its foreign ministry and its armed forces. 
Rebelo said military officers had told him that Viegas, 
trained as a diplomat \"to listen, negotiate and compromise,\" 
was out of step with military services that expect their 
senior leader \"to issue orders and get results.\"  Rebelo said 
the problem is not one of lack of respect in the military for 
civilian authority, but rather the military\'s preference in 
its civilian minister for a political figure capable of 
engaging with congress and the treasury to secure funding and 
protect perogatives.  Unlike Abreu, Rebelo opined that 
Alencar\'s assumption of the defense portfolio \"could be only 
temporary.\"  Rebelo has often been named as a possible 
replacement for Viegas, but Rebelo denied that possibility to 
PolCouns, saying such speculation is \"media exaggeration.\" 
 
8. (C) Comment.  Viegas has been an effective and reliable 
interlocutor for the Mission and the USG on key policy issues 
in his broad area of responsibility, and he has been 
especially valuable in working with us on shootdown and 
Alcantara.  Alencar, a likable and successful businessman, 
has not been especially distinguished as vice president, has 
no known experience with military matters, and does not 
strike us as having either the intellectual or diplomatic 
skills of Viegas.  It remains to be seen how he will handle 
challenging issues, such as shootdown, Brazil\'s leadership of 
MINUSTAH in Haiti or complex civil aviation matters that fall 
in the purview of the defense ministry. However,his position 
as vice president and political saavy may make him an 
appealing choice, or at least a neutral one, in the armed 
forces\' view.  We do not see this development as an 
indication that Brazil\'s armed forces are restive and 
challenging civilian authority.  On the contrary, today\'s 
Brazilian military is thoroughly apolitical.  Nonetheless, 
the civilian ministry remains small and anemic compared to 
the armed services it ostensibly governs, and the Viegas era 
-- despite its accomplishments -- will not be remembered for 
reinforcing the institutional stature and effectiveness of 
the civilian MOD.

SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN HIGH COURT STRIKES DOWN EXCEPTION TO 
ABORTION BAN 
 
REF: BRASILIA 1670 
 
1. SUMMARY.  On October 20, after a stormy debate, Brazil\'s 
Supreme Federal Tribunal struck down a temporary injunction 
issued in July that created a narrow exception (only the 
third) in Brazil\'s abortion ban.  The exception would allow 
abortions in cases of anencephaly (where the fetus has no 
brain).  Threat to the life of the mother and pregnancy 
resulting from rape are the two existing exceptions. 
Anencephaly is linked to maternal nutritional deficiencies 
and has a 100% mortality rate within minutes of birth.  Last 
July, when a judge issued the injunction it sparked a heated 
public debate from medical, legal, religious, and human 
rights officials.  The case is not over: this ruling only 
strikes down the injunction on technical grounds but does not 
decide the underlying case.  The high court must now decide 
whether it will hear arguments on the merits or leave the 
issue to legislators --who have shown little interest in 
being drawn into the debate.  END SUMMARY. 
 
HIGH COURT STRIKES DOWN INJUNCTION 
---------------------------------- 
2.  On 1 July 2004, a judge on Brazil\'s Supreme Federal 
Tribunal (STF), Marco Aurelio Mello, issued a temporary 
injunction that allowed anencephaly cases (where the fetus 
has no brain) to become only the third exception to Brazil\'s 
ban on abortion (reftel).  Threat to the life of the mother 
and pregnancy resulting from rape are the two existing 
exceptions.  That injunction remained in force until October 
20 when, after tempestuous debate, the full Court struck it 
down by a 7-4 vote.  Mello and Judge Joaquim Barbosa nearly 
came to blows during the arguments.  The case is not over: 
the full court decision struck down the injunction on 
technical grounds but did not decide the merits of the 
underlying case. 
 
3.  Anencephaly is linked to maternal nutritional 
deficiencies and has a 100% mortality rate within minutes of 
birth.  Thus, when Judge Mello issued the injunction in July, 
he kicked off a broad public debate over abortion rights with 
jurists, health providers, women\'s rights activists, and 
religious leaders lined up on both sides of the issue.  After 
the ruling, one attorney who argued in support of the 
injunction noted that the Catholic Church \"inundated the 
judges\' computers with e-mails\".  On November 7, speaking in 
Rome to a group of Brazilian pilgrims, the Pope said, \"I hope 
that in every moment (Brazilian) officials continue defending 
life from conception until its natural end\".  According to a 
World Health Organization study Brazil has the world\'s fourth 
highest anencephaly rate (8.6 per 10,000 births).  In a 
survey conducted in Sao Paulo a week before the high court 
decision, 67% of respondents supported the right to terminate 
an anencephalic pregnancy. 
 
4.  The only woman on the high court, Judge Ellen Gracie, 
voted with the majority in striking down the injunction, but 
noted that she did so on a legal technicality and was not 
issuing an opinion on the underlying issue.  If the merits of 
the case come before the court, she is seen as likely to 
support establishing anencephaly as a third exception to the 
abortion ban.  Judge Gracie has noted that the abortion ban 
--like most of Brazil\'s criminal law-- was codified by the 
1940 Penal Code, whereas the Constitution was written much 
later, in 1988, after the end of the military dictatorship. 
Thus, there remain issues on which the law and the 
constitution need to be harmonized.  In addition to Gracie, 
three other judges (including Chief Justice Nelson Jobim) who 
voted to strike down the injunction are seen as possibles to 
vote in favor of a third exception to the abortion ban.  If 
they all change their vote, the anencephaly exception would 
be legalized by an 8-3 majority.  However, the high court may 
also refuse to hear arguments on the merits, thus leaving the 
current ban in place and leaving further action to Congress. 
The Court\'s decision on whether to hear the case is expected 
before year\'s end. 
 
5.  There are currently 24 abortion-related bills in various 
stages of inactivity in the Chamber of Deputies (lower 
house), but only two deal with cases of fetus inviability or 
malformation.  One of these was drafted in 1996 by the 
current Mayor of Sao Paulo, Marta Suplicy.  None of the bills 
have any particular momentum at this time.  Another bill, in 
the Senate, which would have narrowly legalized abortion only 
in cases of anencephaly was recently withdrawn by its author, 
Senator Duciomar Costa (PTB-PA), under pressure from the 
Catholic Church. 
 
COMMENT - LAWS THAT \"DON\'T TAKE HOLD\" 
------------------------------------- 
6.  Since 1989, judges have authorized abortions in hundreds 
of anencephaly cases (on a case-by-case basis) and at least 
ten more were conducted in the wake of the July 1 injunction. 
 Brazil\'s books are full of laws that \"don\'t take hold\" (\"nao 
pega\"), and the abortion ban is one.  Studies in the late 
1990s showed that as many as 31% of Brazilian pregnancies end 
in abortion and that the majority of abortion patients are 
married women who can afford private health plans.  Poorer 
women, more likely to have anencephalic fetuses, are also 
more likely to utilize public health care where the ban on 
abortions is more strictly observed.  Thus, whether or not 
the practice violates the letter of the law, abortions are 
likely to continue to be accessible to many Brazilian women.

1. (C) The United States Mission in Brazil warmly welcomes 
your visit to Manaus.  Your arrival comes on the heels of a 
major shakeup in Brazil\'s Ministry of Defense.  The 
resignation of Minister Jose Viegas and his replacement on 
November 8 by Vice President Jose Alencar is intended to 
repair a relationship between the civilian minister and the 
force commanders that in recent months had suffered from 
tensions and disagreements.  (Reftel describes the stress 
between Minister Viegas and senior military commanders 
leading to his resignation.)  You are the first senior USG 
official to meet with Vice President Alencar in his new 
capacity as Defense Minister.  (Note: Embassy has requested 
the bilateral meeting with Alencar, but no official GOB 
response has been given as of 8 November COB. End Note) 
Being new to his posting, Alencar, we suspect, will 
appreciate words of support for the bilateral mil-mil 
relationship and will be interested in suggestions for 
enhancing those ties.  While he will be cool to our 
entreaties on Article 98, he may be interested in exploring a 
Defense Cooperation Agreement through which we may be able to 
achieve our overall policy objectives. 
 
CHANGE AT THE TOP 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C) Although Viegas\' departure had been anticipated in 
President Lula\'s next cabinet shake-up, expected in early 
2005, the timing could not be postponed any longer.  Recent 
publication of alleged photos of prominent journalist 
Waldomir Herzog, widely thought to have been tortured and 
murdered by the military in 1975, led to a ham-handed 
Brazilian army defense of its behavior during the military 
period (1964-1985).  A communiqu released without Viegas\' 
concurrence by the army appeared to justify human rights 
violations during that era and brought down the wrath of 
President Lula and other government officials -- many of whom 
had been imprisoned or exiled during the dictatorship. 
Minister Viegas\' inability to control senior military 
leadership, and at the very least prevent the embarrassment 
caused by the army\'s letter, could not be ignored any longer. 
 
3.  (C)  In taking over the defense portfolio, Vice President 
Alencar faces some immediate challenges.  While Viegas could 
at least claim political-military expertise from a long 
foreign service career during which he held critically 
important assignments, Alencar has no such experience.  The 
Brazilian military remains totally apolitical.  However, 
senior military leadership has never been happy with the 
civilian supervision that came with the creation of the 
Ministry of Defense in 1999.  Alencar will have to assert his 
authority over the uniformed services, but he knows he must 
do it in a way that does not lead to further rancor. 
 
4.  (C) Almost immediately, the new minister will face the 
issue of possibly opening the sealed archives from the 
military period.  In light of the publicity over Herzog, 
public clamor for release of these files has risen.  The 
military asserts that many files have been disposed of 
following proper legal procedures.  A decree signed by former 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso lengthened to 60 years 
the period these archives are to remain sealed.  Changes may 
also have to be made in the senior uniformed services, 
beginning with Army Commander Francisco Albuquerque, Viegas\' 
adversary.  Alencar will also have to consider how to resolve 
the long-standing $700 million competition for next 
generation fighter aircraft (F-X).  Under Viegas, an 
announcement on a decision on selection of an F-X had been 
postponed numerous times.  However, given the sticker shock 
of new F-X aircraft, the GOB may postpone a decision 
indefinitely. 
 
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LANDSCAPE 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) Brazil\'s democracy is less than two decades old, 
having succeeded the military regime that ruled from 
1964-1985. Lula da Silva, the country\'s first working-class 
president, took office in January 2003.  He passed important 
tax and pension reforms but has made little progress on his 
social agenda, including his flagship Zero Hunger project. 
Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) leads an eight-party coalition 
that holds a majority in both houses of Congress, but the 
coalition is undisciplined, and Lula must make compromises to 
pass his legislation.  In October nationwide municipal 
elections were held to select the country\'s mayors and city 
councils.  The PT lost some key races, including the mayor of 
Sao Paulo, but is still in a leading position to contest the 
2006 presidential race. 
 
6. (SBU) Under President Lula, Brazil has achieved a higher 
international profile, reflected in its leading role in South 
America, its push for a UNSC permanent seat, its spearheading 
of a \"G-20\" group of developing nations, its revitalization 
of Mercosul, and its constructive roles in Haiti and 
Venezuela.  Brazil is an important player on global issues 
such as hunger (witness the September 20 New York 
Conference), HIV/AIDS and the environment.  U.S./Brazilian 
cooperation has been key to progress on the WTO Doha round. 
Brazil and the U.S. are co-chairs of the FTAA negotiations. 
The GOB has focused on South America and developing 
countries, engaging intensively with Mercosul and forging a 
regional approach to trade talks.  Brazilians are committed 
to the UN and other multilateral institutions.  The majority 
of Brazilians oppose the war in Iraq.  Lula has voiced strong 
opposition to the war, but this has not prejudiced his 
approach to broader bilateral relations. 
 
CRIME, TERRORISM, NONPROLIFERATION 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (C)  On counter-terrorism operational issues, cooperation 
between the USG and Brazilian law enforcement and security 
services is good.  The GOB remains hypersensitive to 
allegations that terrorist groups are active on Brazilian 
territory, particularly in the Tri-border region.  Senior GOB 
officials maintain that there is no evidence to support 
claims that terrorists operate on Brazilian territory and the 
GOB has repeatedly asked us for specific information to 
support such allegations.  GOB police and security officials 
acknowledge that fundraising, money laundering, and related 
criminal activities are likely ongoing, but again, they 
request solid intelligence that would link funding with 
terrorist groups.  Brazil has a sizable population with 
ethnic origins in the Middle East, including many who are 
economically and politically influential.  The USG is 
concerned that these communities contain persons who 
financially support terrorist organizations. 
 
8. (C)  Crime remains a severe problem in Brazil\'s large 
cities.  In Rio, where violence has become endemic, a gang 
war earlier this year in Rocinha, a favela notorious for 
crime and drugs, culminated with bloodshed and revealed the 
depth of criminal druglord control over the favelas. The 
police reacted by launching a highly publicized incursion 
into Rocinha. In the countryside, the Landless Movement (MST) 
illegally occupies land, causing confrontations with 
landowners and the GOB.  A role for the Brazilian military in 
dealing with crime and public security is being reviewed, and 
President Lula appears to favor some increased military role. 
 Recent legislation has been passed giving troops in remote 
areas of the Amazon arrest powers when apprehending someone 
committing an illegal act. Many field-grade officers regard 
some armed forces involvement in law enforcement as 
inevitable; however, most senior officers, sensitive to the 
legal ramifications that could result from civilian 
casualties, increased corruption, and the residual legacy of 
21 years of military rule, remain strongly opposed. 
 
9. (C) Brazil has recently found itself in an uncomfortable 
spotlight regarding its non-proliferation credentials.  The 
IAEA is working closely with the GOB over the institution of 
a suitable inspection regime for the new enrichment facility 
at Resende. The GOB expects to have an agreement with the 
IAEA regarding Resende in place soon. In addition, the IAEA, 
the U.S., and many other countries have asked Brazil to sign 
the Additional Protocol (AP) to the NPT, a measure the GOB 
has resisted so far. Brazil argues that the nuclear weapons 
states need to accelerate their disarmament even as the 
nonweapons states consider additional compliance measures. 
Brazil is not expected to sign the AP until at least mid 
2005. Meanwhile, Brazil is considering signing onto the 
International Code of Conduct for missile technology but 
remains unenthusiastic about the Proliferation Security 
Initiative and the Australia Group. 
 
THE ARMED FORCES IN BRAZIL 
-------------------------- 
 
10. (C)  Since the end of military rule in 1985, the armed 
services have supported Brazil\'s civilian leadership and 
adapted to their new apolitical status, despite the problems 
noted above with the new civilian Ministry of Defense, 
created in 1999.  The officer corps is professional and 
dedicated to defending Brazil\'s constitution. 
 
11. (C)  Public esteem does not translate, however, into 
funds.  Military budgets have decreased steadily for 15 
years, with the severest cuts introduced over the last four 
years.  This has naturally had a negative impact on the 
readiness of the armed forces.  As President Lula stresses 
social priorities while working within tight fiscal 
constraints, the prognosis for the military\'s budget is for 
more of the same. The military grumbles that it is entitled 
to pay raises.  The lack of money dampens the force 
projection capability.  Procurement programs for new weapons 
systems to replace outmoded equipment are also starved for 
funds, while programs such as the development of a Brazilian 
nuclear-powered submarine and maintenance of antiquated 
vessels drain resources that could be better directed 
elsewhere. 
 
12. (C)  As Viegas\' resignation shows, a major internal issue 
is the relationship between the armed services and the 
civilian-led Ministry of Defense.  Minister Viegas created, 
for example, a four-star level secretariat of cooperative 
studies headed by a diplomat.  Many officers felt such senior 
civilian placements within the Ministry diminished the 
military\'s access and rendered it less effective in fighting 
important bureaucratic battles.  In addition to the problems 
noted above with the MOD, within the Ministry there are 
problems in the chain of command.  Although the Chief of 
Defense and the Secretary for Strategy, Policy and 
International Affairs are four-star generals with direct 
advisory roles to the Minister, their positions are 
unofficially subordinate to the service commanders.  Their 
ability to impose jointness is compromised.  Morale among the 
senior military grades has been negatively affected, leading 
to transfers and some retirements. 
 
13. (C)  The services maintain close ties with counterparts 
in neighboring countries and there are no identifiable 
trouble spots in these relations.  Each service conducts 
annual or more frequent dialogue at various levels of command 
with neighboring militaries.  Army-to-army relations with 
Brazil\'s neighbors, for example, are conducted at the chief 
of staff, regional command, brigade, and battalion levels. 
Despite a troubled history, relations between the Argentine 
and Brazilian militaries have never been closer.  Brazil is 
also doing some regional intelligence sharing, and there is 
steady improvement in this field with Colombia and Peru. 
 
SPECIFIC ISSUES 
--------------- 
 
14. (C)  Army Issues:  Brazil\'s army has the lead in MINUSTAH 
and a 1200 man PKO force has been on the ground since June. 
While army leadership is confident in its ability to conduct 
such PKO missions, its troops are being stretched to the 
limit.  Foreign Minister Amorim is pressing hard for other 
countries to fill their UN commitments for MINUSTAH.  The 
army is attentive to Brazil\'s borders, particularly in the 
Amazon Basin where it has relocated 5,000 troops and 
established several new frontier platoons.  There continues 
to be concern with the spillover effects of  the Colombian 
conflict and some skirmishes with the FARC have been 
reported.  While the army does not anticipate a direct 
confrontation with the FARC, there is recognition that FARC 
gunrunning and narcotics smuggling activities will eventually 
have to be challenged.  While the various commands may lack 
hardware and support, they are keenly aware of their mission 
and seem prepared to carry it out. 
 
15. (C)  Navy Issues: In recent years, the navy procured 23 
A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft from Kuwait and bought the former 
French aircraft carrier Foch, renamed the Sao Paulo.  Several 
pilots have already become carrier qualified in the U.S.  The 
Navy is sending on average two officers a year to the U.S. 
for flight training.  In March 2004, the navy signed an LOA 
for the FMS LINK 11 case to upgrade their secure 
communications.  In a program plagued by technological and 
design flaws, the navy\'s nuclear submarine program has 
swallowed about $1 billion in R&D costs.  The navy claims it 
is still 20 years, and $500 million, away from final 
development and delivery of a nuclear sub.  (We believe it 
would be much longer and cost much more.)   Meanwhile, the 
navy is in dire need of escort vessels, and is hard pressed 
to maintain its aging fleet. Navy command is interested in 
submarine rescue, diesel submarine, and UNITAS training and 
exercises. 
 
16. (C)  Air Force Issues:  The air force desperately wants 
to replace its aging Mirages.  President Lula has continued 
to postpone a decision on a new generation fighter (F-X), an 
understandable decision given the cost involved.  New 
Lockheed F-16 Block 50 aircraft were offered in the 
competition.  However, recognizing that other competitors 
might be preferred by FAB, Lockheed-Martin also decided to 
offer used F-16s in a deal that would provide the air force 
with capable aircraft at a fraction of the cost of new 
planes.  However, FAB continues to focus on the procurement 
of new, not used, aircraft.  Regardless of the decision, GOB 
funding of the F-X will be difficult. FAB is also looking to 
replace its aging UH-1 helicopter fleet.  In February 2004, 
the FAB sent a delegation to Alabama to discuss possible 
modifications needed on the 6-10 Black Hawks they are 
interested in purchasing.  Congressional approval is expected 
this month with the final LOR valued at $166M for 10 
BLACKHAWK Helicopters.  FAB will put initial investment of 
$100M against a new FMS case for purchase of the BLACKHAWKS. 
First delivery is expected in June 2005 for two helicopters. 
 
17. (C)  SIVAM (Amazon Surveillance System):  Now essentially 
complete, the SIVAM system built by Raytheon consists of 
ground, aerial, and space-based sensors, communications and 
patrol aircraft.  Raytheon has had contractual differences 
with the GOB, but the company reports the situation has 
improved and its support for the project will not stop. 
Brazil has indicated its willingness to share data with 
neighboring countries under certain conditions. 
 
18. (C)  Article 98:  Brazil has not signed an Article 98 
agreement and is subject to ASPA sanctions.  The GOB, in 
keeping with its long-standing multilateralism, insisted it 
was committed to the International Criminal Court and that 
signing our Article 98 waiver would weaken this commitment. 
The Government also asserted that it could conceive of no 
circumstances under which it would subject U.S. citizens to 
extradition to The Hague. The GOB calculated that the 
projected loss annually under ASPA sanctions of $500,000 of 
IMET funds was tolerable.  However, the imposition of full 
FMS pricing for training, an unforeseen consequence of ASPA, 
caught the GOB by surprise and has caused additional 
frustration and friction.  Despite this additional blow, the 
loss of access to EDA grant funds, the withdrawal of the 
Spruance destroyer offer (combination sale and grant 
transfer), and the financial impact on the training portion 
of procurement offers such as the F-16, we do not expect 
Brazil to reverse its position on Article 98.  In fact, the 
MOD has indicated that it will continue training at the same 
level as pre-ASPA sanctions, just with other countries.  The 
armed services have already shifted training to Great Britain 
and France and has new programs with Russia, China, and even 
Vietnam. 
 
19. (C)  Airbridge Denial/Shootdown:  Following extensive 
USG-GOB consultations to develop strict interdiction 
parameters for protecting innocent lives, on October 17 
Brazil began implementation of its 1998 law permitting the 
shootdown/forcedown of civil aircraft suspected of illicit 
trafficking.  On October 16 President Bush signed a 
Presidential Determination to waive liability under U.S. law 
owing to the extraordinary threat trafficking poses to 
Brazil\'s sovereignty. 
 
20. (SBU)  Despite irritants in the relationship, we consider 
ties between the U.S. and Brazilian militaries good.  Brazil 
and the U.S. will continue to participate in joint exercises 
such as Cabanas and UNITAS. In June, the aircraft carrier 
Ronald Reagan made a port visit to Rio. In July 2005 Brazil 
will host PKO-South and the annual Unitas exercise.  The MOD 
still views the U.S. military relationship as important and 
the U.S. a dependable, if sometimes irritating, partner. 
Brazil, as a strategic partner, remains important to the U.S. 
 Beyond ASPA, there remain many areas of defense cooperation 
and interaction, as well as areas of cooperation that remain 
untapped.  Many in the Brazilian Armed Forces recognize that 
they must expand their role in counter narcotics and counter 
terrorism.  As the MOD proceeds with the development of a 
National Military Strategy for Brazil, the U.S. can offer its 
perspectives on the process. 
 
21. (C)  Maintaining the U.S.-Brazil pol-mil relationship 
requires constant attention and, perhaps, more effort than 
with any other bilateral relationship in the hemisphere. 
Within Brazil, there is no institutional propensity to curry 
favor with the U.S.  Given its size, Brazil views itself as a 
regional leader and global player, even if it sometimes 
appears to fall short of what is expected from a world power. 
 The GOB will be eager for ways to enhance the bilateral 
relationship, overcoming the obstacles created by ASPA and 
Brazil\'s rejection of an Article 98 agreement.  The GOB has 
expressed interest in negotiating an umbrella Defense 
Cooperation Agreement (DCA) that would replace the former 
Mutual Defense Assistance Treaty, unilaterally abrogated by 
the GOB in 1980 due to our human rights policies.  But the 
GOB will also remain sensitive that it not appear too eager 
to consummate deals with us that could backfire politically.

PRESIDENT PACHECO, 5 NOVEMBER 2004 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN J. DANILOVICH. REASONS: 1.4 
(B)(D). 
 
1. (SBU) Ambassador Danilovich met over dinner in Rio de 
Janeiro on 5 November 2004 with Costa Rican President Abel 
Pacheco and vice foreign minister Vargas, who were in the 
city for the Rio Group meeting.  Pacheco provided some candid 
and provocative observations on the following issues: 
 
2. Rio Group Meeting: 
 
-- (C) Lula Gives Cuba a Miss: To general relief among the 
assembled chiefs of state, President Lula da Silva did not 
mention Cuba in his formal remarks, Pacheco said.  There had 
been fear among participants that Lula might repeat Foreign 
Minister Amorim\'s recent calls in other regional fora to 
reach out to Cuba, an appeal that has generally fallen flat 
among Brazil\'s neighbors.  Pacheco said rumor in the meeting 
had it that the original speech draft provided to Lula by the 
foreign ministry had included a Cuba section, which the 
presidency had, after consideration, decided to delete. 
 
-- (C) Chavez:  Pacheco also noted that insulting jokes about 
Venezuelan President Chavez\'s \"buffoonery\"  were \"rampant\" 
throughout the course of the meeting.  (But see para 3 
below).  (Comment: Chavez was vocal and utterly isolated in 
his criticism of the UN mission in Haiti; the GOB effectively 
rallied the Rio Group behind a robust statement of support 
for international efforts there. End comment.) 
 
-- (C) Apologies: Pacheco confided that he had quietly made 
the rounds of leaders at the meeting in Rio, to privately 
apologize for the facts surrounding the recent resignation of 
OAS Secretary General Rodriques, who returned to Costa Rica 
to face a corruption investigation.  Pacheco noted that he 
had introduced language for three strong anti-corruption 
resolutions during the Rio meeting, two of which were adopted. 
 
 
3. Other Issues: 
 
-- (C) New OAS SG: Pacheco said that Costa Rica will support 
Paco Flores for the new SG.  If that candidacy does not move 
ahead, Costa Rica will consider backing the candidates from 
Trinidad and Mexico. 
 
-- (S) Venezuelan clandestine activity: Pacheco told 
Ambassador that Costa Rica\'s intelligence service is 
surveilling the activities of the Venezuelan cultural attache 
in San Jose.  The GOCR believes the attache is an 
intelligence officer who is meeting secretly with labor union 
officials, and has brought 200,000 USD into Costa Rica to pay 
labor activists to stage \"provocations,\" perhaps during the 
upcoming Ibero-American summit in Costa Rica.  Pacheco 
requested USG intelligence assistance in the matter, and 
Ambassador undertook to pass the request on. 
 
-- (C) Corruption: Pacheco opined that it is shocking and 
embarrassing that Costa Rica has two former presidents in 
jail for corruption, with a third on the way probably heading 
there soon.  At the same time, Pacheco also found it 
constructive and salutary that Costa Rica\'s justice system is 
actively investigating and punishing corrupt officials, and 
that culprits are \"serving real jail time, not in house 
arrest and their beach homes.\"

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, PREL, BR, Domestic Politics 
SUBJECT: PMDB PARTY AGAIN THREATENS TO LEAVE BRAZIL\'S 
GOVERNING COALITION 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Brazil\'s PMDB party, a large but unreliable 
member of President Lula\'s ruling coalition, is going through 
another bout of angst about whether to leave the coalition. 
A November 10 meeting of the party\'s leadership left such a 
threat --made by the party\'s \"oppositionist wing\"-- hanging 
in the air.  Meanwhile, the party\'s \"governist wing\" would 
rather remain in Lula\'s administration and enjoy the fruits 
of collaboration, which include government appointments and 
pork spending.  The PMDB has teetered between government and 
opposition for the two years of Lula\'s term, and threats by 
party leaders to pull out are widely seen as an attempt to 
extort more perks.  The PMDB\'s unreliability is a running 
headache for the administration, whose leaders never know how 
the party\'s 78 Deputies and 23 Senators will vote.  On 
December 12, the PMDB will hold a national convention to 
decide its future.  In the meantime, administration leaders 
will look for ways to appease the dipterous party.  In the 
past, decision-points such as this have always resulted in 
the PMDB\'s remaining in the coalition but making more demands 
for perks.  If the party pulls out of the coalition, it would 
be a significant blow to Lula\'s legislative agenda.  But with 
its fractiousness, the PMDB weakens the coalition nearly as 
much from the inside as it would from outside.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE PMDB\'S \"PHYSIOLOGY\" 
----------------------- 
2. (SBU) The Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement 
(PMDB) defines the Brazilian term \"physiologist\", a 
pejorative denoting a person or party for sale, always 
seeking personal advantage.  The party survives on a vast 
grass-roots apparatus built around regional chiefs and 
patronage networks, which it nurtures by joining the 
governing coalition at the state or federal level whenever 
possible.  This pattern results in some incongruous 
alignments.  For example, the party struggles bitterly 
against President Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT) in some states 
while working in coalition with it in others.  The PMDB was a 
member of former-President Cardoso\'s administration, but 
within months after Lula took office in 2003, the PMDB had 
worked its way into his administration.  The party\'s status 
as a full coalition member was cemented in January 2004 when 
Lula shuffled his cabinet to create two vacancies 
(Communications and Social Security) for PMDB ministers. 
 
MOTIVES OF THE \"OPPOSITIONISTS\" 
------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) It has been a rocky two years.  Lula needs the PMDB 
because of its size (78 Deputies and 23 Senators).  But the 
party is guided by a large \"oppositionist wing\" that votes 
against the administration in Congress, criticizes it in 
public, and incessantly begs for more perks.  Lula typically 
gets only 50-70% of the PMDB\'s floor votes.  The 
oppositionists are not guided by principle, but by fluid 
assessments of their own interests, which range from the 
parochial in local party struggles to decisions about the 
2006 presidential race:  whether the PMDB will support Lula, 
or will support the PSDB challenger, or will run its own 
candidate.  Each option carries risk.  The PMDB will never be 
more than an unrespected junior partner in Lula\'s coalition, 
and while staying with Lula brings certain benefits and may 
even yield the vice-presidential slot on Lula\'s 2006 slate, 
it would also doom many PMDB candidates in state and 
congressional races who will be facing PT opponents.  By the 
same token, leaving the coalition now would mean giving up 
the cherished cabinet slots and hundreds of mid-level 
government appointments.  As for the third option, despite 
Anthony Garotinho\'s self-promotion, the party has no national 
stars capable of making a credible challenge to Lula in the 
2006 presidential race. 
 
4. (SBU) Among the \"oppositionists\", none clamors louder than 
Garotinho, who runs the party\'s Rio branch and needs to open 
some daylight between himself and Lula if he is to launch 
another run at the presidency.  Similarly, some PMDB 
governors (e.g., in Rio Grande do Sul, Pernambuco, and Rio de 
Janeiro) face tough struggles with their local PT opponents 
and need to clarify the battle lines before 2006.  Party 
president and Federal Deputy Michel Temer of Sao Paulo, has 
suggested looking for a third way, whereby the party becomes 
\"independent\" rather than joining either the government or 
opposition.  This approach is ridiculed by Senate President 
Jose Sarney, who comments, \"A position of \'independence\' 
means to sit on the fence, and in politics there are no 
fences.\" 
 
 
\"GOVERNISTS\" LIKE THE STATUS QUO 
-------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) The party\'s \"governists\" include Senate President 
Jose Sarney, leading Senator Renan Calheiros, and 
Communications Minister Eunicio Oliveira.  All are 
northeasterners, and all have benefited from a close 
relationship with the administration.  Sarney\'s machinations 
in the Senate have helped the administration out of more than 
one jam in the past two years.  But his desire to remain as 
Senate President, and Calheiros\' desire to replace him in 
February 2005, have left both in an unseemly scramble for 
administration support.  The \"governists\" command only a 
minority in the PMDB leadership, and Sarney\'s 
pro-administration speech at the November 10 party leadership 
meeting was met with a thunderous silence.  Oliveira, 
however, notes that October\'s municipal elections raised the 
adrenaline all around, and once tempers have cooled, the PMDB 
should remain in the governing coalition. 
 
COMMENT - THE MORE THINGS CHANGE... 
----------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) The \"oppositionist\" and \"governist\" wings are 
sometimes referred to as \"(former-President) Cardoso\'s 
widows\" and \"Lula\'s courtesans\".  The real outcome of the 
November 10 meeting was to call a national convention for 
December 12.  In the past two years, decision points such as 
this have always had one result:  the PMDB remains awkwardly 
in Lula\'s coalition but insists on getting more perks in 
order to solidify its wavering loyalties.  It is possible 
that this time will be different.  October\'s municipal 
elections reanimated many of the local PT-PMDB party 
struggles that had lain dormant earlier in Lula\'s term.  And 
the elections also marked Lula\'s halfway point, meaning the 
parties must begin in earnest their jockeying for the 2006 
national elections. 
 
7. (SBU) In advance of the December 12 PMDB convention, look 
for the administration to throw some bones to the party, 
ranging from pork spending (Lula has queued up some USD$200 
million in funding for \"congressional amendments\" to be 
disbursed by year\'s end), to a promise of more policy 
influence within the administration, to an offer of the 
vice-presidential slot on Lula\'s 2006 campaign slate.  If, on 
December 12, the PMDB chooses to remain in the coalition, 
look for this same crisis to erupt again in 2005. 
 
8. (SBU) It would be a blow to Lula if the PMDB were to pull 
out of the coalition and leave his legislative agenda in 
limbo.  But the PMDB has never pretended to be more than a 
high-maintenance ally-of-convenience whose constant sniping 
often exposes coalition fissures.  If the party were to bolt, 
it would leave a power vacuum and empty cabinet seats that 
could be filled by other parties, while Lula could win over 
many PMDB votes in Congress with special favors.  At this 
moment we do not judge that the PMDB is any more likely to 
leave the coalition than it was in the past.  But if the 
balance of power should turn by the December 12 party 
convention, the coalition would be damaged but not crippled 
by the party\'s departure.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BR, HA, POL-MIL Issues 
SUBJECT: MIXED CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO TRAVEL TO HAITI 
-- REQUEST MEETING WITH U.S. AMBASSADOR 
 
 
1. (SBU) On November 9, Brazilian Federal Deputy Maninha paid 
a courtesy call on Ambassador Danilovich.  Maninha is the 
current president of COPA (Confederation of the Parliaments 
of the Americas), and this week she is leading a seven-member 
delegation (from three countries) on a fact-finding trip to 
Haiti.  She asked our assistance in arranging a meeting with 
Ambassador James Foley. 
 
2. (SBU) Deputada Maninha is a good friend and contact of the 
US embassy here.  She has traveled to the US on 
embassy-sponsored programs, and she is currently the 
Vice-Chair of the Brazilian Chamber\'s Foreign Affairs 
Committee.  As current president of COPA, she is leading a 
seven-member delegation to Haiti in order to report back to 
the Brazilian Congress and COPA on the state of affairs 
there.  She requests a meeting with Ambassador Foley or the 
DCM, and we support her request. 
 
3. (SBU) Delegation members are: 
 
1- Federal Deputy Maninha, Brazil 
2- Representative Charlotte L\'Ecuyer, Canada 
3- Mr. Jopel Monsils, Assistant to Rep. L\'Ecuyer 
4- Federal Deputy Fernando Gabeira, Brazil. 
5- Federal Deputy Clair Flora Martins, Brazil 
6- Mr. Joelson Dias, Assistant to Dep. Maninha 
7- Sra. Jannette Madriz, Venezuela. 
 
4. (SBU) We understand that the delegation will be in Haiti 
during November 12-15.  We apologize for the short notice. 
Post would greatly appreciate if Embassy Port-au-Prince could 
meet with Maninha\'s delegation at your convenience.  Due to 
the short notice, you can respond by contacting the Brazilian 
Embassy in Port-au-Prince; or contacting Embassy Brasilia 
(Poloff Richard Reiter at work: 55-61-312-7343, cel: 
55-61-9982-1904; or Pol Asst Barbara Ramos at work: 
55-61-312-7075), or Deputy Maninha\'s office (Ms. Inae at 
work: 55-61-915-1952, or cel: 8118-3310). 
 
5. (SBU) Biographical Note: 
- Dep. Maninha (pronounced \"ma-NEEN-ya\") is a Federal Deputy 
from President Lula\'s Workers\' Party (PT); she represents the 
Federal District of Brasilia.  A physician by background, 
this is her first term in the federal Congress after two 
terms in the state assembly.  As a member, and now 
Vice-Chair, of the Foreign Affairs Committee, she has been 
active in discussions on free trade and Haiti.  She comes 
from the Workers\' Party\'s left-wing but is a reasonable 
interlocutor regarding US foreign policy issues.  She 
understands English but speaks it only haltingly. 
 
- Dep. Fernando Gabeira is a more complicated case.  As a 
leftist journalist in 1969 opposed to the military regime, he 
was part of a group that kidnapped US Ambassador to Brazil, 
Charles Elbrick.  Gabeira released Elbrick after three days, 
in return for the regime\'s releasing a dozen political 
prisoners.  Gabeira is now a respected Federal Deputy who 
founded Brazil\'s Green Party and later joined Lula\'s Workers\' 
Party.  He is currently \"without party\".  Because of the 
kidnapping, Gabeira is ineligible to receive a US visa, and 
US ambassadors here have chosen not to meet with him 
formally, though there are occasional informal conversations. 
 (NOTE:  Dep. Maninha told us that her group would be 
\"understanding\" if Amb. Foley chooses not to meet with Dep. 
Gabeira.)  While Gabeira is serious in conversation and his 
views are respected in the Brazilian Congress, given the 
context, post suggests that he not be included in Embassy 
Port-au-Prince meetings with this delegation.

SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR AND MINISTER OF MINES AND ENERGY 
DISCUSS GOB\'S NEW ENERGY MODEL/NRG INVESTMENT DISPUTE 
 
REF:   A) BRASILIA 528, B) RIO DE JANEIRO 518 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  ON NOVEMBER 8, 
AMBASSADOR PAID A COURTESY CALL UPON MINISTER OF MINES AND 
ENERGY DILMA ROUSSEFF.  THE MINISTER EXPLAINED TO THE 
AMBASSADOR THE THINKING BEHIND THE GOB\'S NEW ENERGY MODEL, 
WHICH MINISTRY OFFICIALS CHARACTERIZE AS A \"HYBRID\" AIMED 
AT PROMOTING COMPETITION IN THE MARKET WHILE STRENGTHENING 
STATE CONTROL.  THE AMBASSADOR MADE THE POINT THAT MAJOR 
U.S. INVESTORS (INTER ALIA, DUKE POWER) CURRENTLY OPERATING 
IN THE ELECTRICITY GENERATION MARKET FELT THAT THE NEW 
MODEL RETROACTIVELY CHANGED THE RULES OF THE GAME TO THEIR 
DETRIMENT.  (A DIRECTOR OF THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR 
REGULATORY AGENCY SEPARATELY EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM OF THE 
NEW MODEL AND POINTED TO THE GOB\'S DECEMBER AUCTION TO 
SUPPLY POWER AS THE NEW MODEL\'S FIRST MAJOR TEST.) 
AMBASSADOR ALSO URGED MINISTER ROUSSEFF TO MOVE QUICKLY TO 
HELP ENSURE THAT PETROBRAS PAID AN USD 83 MILLION ARBITRAL 
AWARD DUE THE U.S. FIRM NRG.  ROUSSEFF PLEDGED TO 
FACILITATE DISCUSSION BETWEEN NRG AND PETROBRAS ON THE 
MODALITIES FOR PROCEEDING WITH THE PAYMENT.  IN CLOSING, 
MINISTER ROUSSEFF EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR ALL THE HELP 
THAT DOE - AND IN PARTICULAR, SECRETARY ABRAHAM - HAS BEEN 
ABLE TO PROVIDE IN TERMS OF SUPPORT ON ISSUES SUCH AS 
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES. END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
NRG ADVOCACY 
------------ 
 
2. (SBU) IN A NOVEMBER 8 COURTESY CALL UPON MINISTER 
ROUSSEFF AND HER CHIEF OF STATE (NELSON JOSE HUBNER 
MOREIRA), AMBASSADOR, (ACCOMPANIED BY ECONCOUNS, DEPUTY 
SENIOR COMMERCIAL OFFICER, AND SPECASST) URGED THE GOB TO 
QUICKLY COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE US FIRM NRG 
ENERGY, INC. REGARDING THE TIMING/METHOD FOR PAYMENT OF AN 
USD 83 MILLION ARBITRAL AWARD DUE THE COMPANY.  ALTHOUGH 
NRG PREVAILED AGAINST PETROBRAS IN ARBITRATION REGARDING 
THE LATTER\'S MOVE TO ASSUME OPERATIONAL CONTROL OVER THE 
TERMO RIO PROJECT, TO DATE PETROBRAS HAS NOT COMPENSATED 
NRG AS REQUIRED BY THE ARBITRAL AWARD. 
 
3. (SBU) MINISTER ROUSSEFF EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT THIS 
ISSUE WAS OUTSTANDING, NOTING THAT THE PETROBRAS BOARD HAD 
DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PAYMENT OVER TWO MONTHS 
AGO.  SHE EXPLAINED THAT THERE WERE THREE POSSIBLE 
MECHANISMS FOR EFFECTING PAYMENT:  A) NRG COULD SET UP A 
COMPANY IN BRAZIL AND RECEIVE IN REAIS, B) PETROBRAS COULD 
REMIT DOLLARS TO NRG (WHICH WOULD REQUIRE CENTRAL BANK 
APPROVAL), AND C) PETROBRAS COULD PAY NRG FROM ITS OVERSEAS 
DOLLAR ACCOUNTS.  MINISTER ROUSSEFF PLEDGED TO IMMEDIATELY 
PHONE PETROBRAS FINANCIAL DIRECTOR GABRIEL TO REQUEST THAT 
HE ENTER INTO CONTACT WITH NRG TO ASSURE THEM THAT PAYMENT 
WOULD BE FORTHCOMING.  NOTE: PER NOV. 10 DISCUSSIONS 
BETWEEN FCS AND PETROBRAS, IT APPEARS THAT NRG AND 
PETROBRAS WILL SOON RESUME DIRECT TALKS. PETROBRAS WAS 
UPSET THAT THE USG DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WAS NOT 
COMMUNICATING OPENLY WITH NRG OR THE USG.  HOWEVER AFTER 
MANY UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH 
PRESIDENT DUTRA, PETROBRAS DID APPEAR TO BE AVOIDING THE 
SUBJECT. 
 
NEW ENERGY MODEL 
---------------- 
 
4. (SBU) AMBASSADOR THEN QUERIED ROUSSEFF ABOUT HER PLANS 
FOR RESTRUCTURING THE ENERGY SECTOR.  ROUSSEFF NOTED THAT 
UPON ENTERING THE MINISTRY IN 2003, SHE FOUND THAT THE 
SECTOR WAS IN A PRECARIOUS STATE.  ASSETS PRICES HAD 
DROPPED WORLDWIDE, AND BRAZIL FACED A DOUBLE WHAMMY AS ITS 
ECONOMY WAS IN CRISIS.  HOWEVER, SINCE THEN, SHE SAID, THE 
HEALTH OF THE COMPANIES (BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE) IN THE 
SECTOR HAS BEEN RESTORED, EVEN THOUGH THE GOB NEEDS TO DO 
MORE IN TERMS OF STREAMLINING OF LICENSE/ENVIRONMENTAL 
REQUIREMENTS, ESPECIALLY FOR HYDRO GENERATION PLANTS. 
 
5. (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT US INVESTORS 
(INCLUDING DUKE ENERGY) WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE MINISTER\'S 
PLAN TO SUB-DIVIDE THE ENERGY GENERATION MARKET INTO \"OLD 
ENERGY,\" I.E. ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2000, AND 
\"NEW ENERGY,\" POST JANUARY 1, 2000.  OLD ENERGY WOULD BE 
SUBJECT TO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS AND LESS PRICE VARIATION; 
NEW ENERGY WOULD BE FREE TO FLUCTUATE WITH THE MARKET.  AS 
DUKE ENTERED THE MARKET PRE JANUARY 1, 2000, ITS PLANTS 
WOULD BE CONSIDERED OLD ENERGY AND WOULD HAVE TO COMPETE 
PRINCIPALLY WITH FULLY-DEPRECIATED STATE-OWNED PLANTS.  THE 
MINISTER REPLIED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD DUKE\'S COMPLAINTS, BUT 
THAT WHAT THEY WANTED WAS SOMETHING SHE COULD NOT PROVIDE. 
BECAUSE NEW INVESTORS FACED HIGHER RISKS - AS THEIR 
FACILITIES WERE NOT IN PLACE - IT WAS ONLY LOGICAL TO 
REWARD THEM WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN HIGHER RETURNS. 
 
REGULATORY AGENCY SKEPTICAL OF NEW MODEL 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) IN A SEPARATE MEETING WITH PAULO PEDROSA, ONE OF 
THE DIRECTORS OF THE ENERGY REGULATOR (ANEEL) AND HIS 
ADVISOR, RULEMAR PESSOA, ECONOFFS HEARD ANEEL\'S CONCERNS 
WITH THE MINISTRY\'S HYBRID MODEL.  PEDROSA, WHO WAS 
APPOINTED BY PREVIOUS PRESIDENT CARDOSO, CHARACTERIZED THE 
MINISTRY\'S NEW HYBRID MODEL AS A PARADIGM SHIFT.  HE STATED 
THAT BRAZIL IS MOVING FROM FDI-CENTRIC MODEL, BASED ON A 
FIXED LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK AND INDEPENDENT REGULATORY 
REGIME, TO A MODEL THAT SEEKS TO LEVERAGE INFRASTRUCTURE 
DEVELOPMENT WITH MONEY FROM THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK 
(BNDES) AND PENSION FUNDS.  THE ERA OF FREE 
COMMERCIALIZATION OF ENERGY WAS \"ABORTED,\" PEDROSA SAID, 
WITH THE HYBRID MODEL NOW GIVING THE STATE A LEADING ROLE. 
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FUTURE THE STATE WILL DETERMINE HOW 
MUCH NEW CAPACITY IS NEEDED, BASED ON FORECASTS FROM A 
NEWLY-CREATED AND PURPORTEDLY- INDEPENDENT ENERGY RESEARCH 
INSTITUTE (IPE).  (NOTE:  WITH THE ECONOMY EXPANDING 
BRISKLY, SOME INDUSTRY FORECASTERS ARE ALREADY PREDICTING 
ELECTRICITY SHORTAGES BY 2008 UNLESS SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT 
IS MADE TO KEEP PACE WITH THE BURGEONING DEMAND.  THE 
MINISTER HERSELF HAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS 
INVESTMENT OF USD 2.9 BILLION IN GENERATING CAPACITY, USD 1 
BILLION IN TRANSMISSION, AND USD 2 BILLION IN 
DISTRIBUTION.) 
 
7. (U) IN MOVING TO THE NEW MODEL, HOWEVER, THE MINISTRY OF 
MINES AND ENERGY (MME) HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR EXISTING 
GENERATORS AND INVESTMENT IN A MODEL DESIGNED WITH NEW 
POWER IN MIND.  THIS WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE MME\'S AWKWARD 
DUAL POOL MODEL: THE FIRST A POOL OF \"OLD ENERGY,\" PRODUCED 
BY PLANTS THAT CAME ON LINE BEFORE THE CUTOFF DATE, AND A 
SECOND OF \"NEW ENERGY,\" PRODUCED BY NEW PLANTS THAT CAME ON 
LINE AFTER THE CUTOFF (REFTELS).  THIS DIVIDES INTO TWO 
SEPARATE COMPETITION GROUPS POWER GENERATORS THAT HAD NOT 
YET AMORTIZED THEIR INVESTMENTS (NEW ENERGY) AND THOSE THAT 
HAVE (OLD ENERGY).  THE GOB IS FORGING AHEAD WITH PLANS TO 
IMPLEMENT THE MODEL, BEGINNING WITH AN EARLY DECEMBER 
\"MEGA-AUCTION\" FOR 55 MW OF OLD ENERGY, TO BE SOLD TO MEET 
EXISTING, PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL BUSINESS, POWER 
DEMAND. 
 
8. (U) PEDROSA EXPLAINED TO ECONOFFS THAT POWER SOLD INTO 
THE OLD ENERGY POOL WILL BE BOUGHT BY DISTRIBUTORS AND 
RESOLD TO \"CAPTIVE\" CONSUMERS, PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL 
CUSTOMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES.  GENERATORS THAT DO NOT 
SELL INTO THE POOL MAY COMPETE FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL OR 
INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS, KNOWN AS \"FREE\" CUSTOMERS, WHO RETAIN 
THE RIGHT TO CONTRACT DIRECTLY FOR POWER SUPPLIERS.  THE 
POOL IS OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE MORE EXPENSIVE POWER (3000 MW 
WORTH) FROM SMALL HYDROELECTRIC PLANTS, WIND PLANTS AND 
SOME THERMAL POWER GENERATION PLANTS.  ISOLATED POWER GRIDS 
IN THE AMAZON, PRIMARILY RELIANT ON DIESEL FUEL-BASED 
GENERATION, RECEIVE A SUBSIDY. 
 
9.  (U) IN EARLY 2005, ACCORDING TO PEDROSA, THE GOB PLANS 
TO AUCTION OFF AUTHORIZATIONS TO BUILD NEW POWER PLANTS. 
THE AMOUNT TO BE AUCTIONED WILL BE BASED ON DEMAND 
PROJECTIONS DRAFTED BY THE IPE.  THESE NEW PLANTS WOULD BE 
REQUIRED TO SELL INTO A \"NEW ENERGY\" POWER POOL, WHICH 
WOULD BE USED MEET THE IPE-FORECASTED EXPANSION OF DEMAND. 
THE AUTHORIZATIONS TO BUILD NEW PLANTS WILL BE AWARDED TO 
THOSE WHO OFFER THE LOWEST FINAL ENERGY PRICE.  OLD ENERGY, 
GIVEN ITS ALREADY-AMORTIZED INVESTMENT, WOULD BE ABLE TO 
UNDERCUT THE PRICES CHARGED BY NEW PLANTS AND WOULD 
THEREFORE NOT BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE NEW ENERGY MARKET. 
 
10. (SBU) PEDROSA BELIEVES THAT THE RESULTS OF THE DECEMBER 
AUCTION WILL BE INDICATIVE OF HOW THE POWER SECTOR VIEWS 
THE NEW MODEL.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF FEW LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR 
SALES TO THE POOL ARE OFFERED, IT WOULD INDICATE POWER 
GENERATORS ARE BETTING ON RISING POWER PRICES AND UNWILLING 
TO TIE UP THEIR CAPACITY FOR LONG WITH SALES TO THE POOL. 
THIS WOULD BE AN IMPLICIT CALCULATION THERE WOULD NOT BE 
SUFFICIENT CAPACITY IN THE FUTURE, AND TO SOME DEGREE AN 
INDICTMENT OF THE MODEL ITSELF.  LIKEWISE, OLD ENERGY 
PRODUCERS COULD DELIBERATELY BID HIGH SO AS TO LOSE OUT ON 
SALES TO THE POOL BUT THEREBY RESERVE THEIR CAPACITY TO 
COMPETE FOR THE LARGER INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS 
(\"FREE CUSTOMERS\") THAT ARE ALLOWED TO CONTRACT DIRECTLY 
FOR THEIR POWER SUPPLIES. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. (SBU) WITH RESPECT TO THE NEW ENERGY MODEL, ROUSSEFF 
AND THE MINISTRY REPEATEDLY HAVE RESPONDED TO CRITICISM 
FROM BOTH INDUSTRY AND ANEEL WITH THE SAME STOCK ANSWERS 
THAT SHE GAVE THE AMBASSADOR.  ROUSSEFF BELIEVES STRONGLY 
THAT THE STATE MUST PLAY A FAIRLY CENTRAL ROLE IN 
ORGANIZING MARKETS.  THE MARKET, HOWEVER, WILL SOON HAVE 
ITS OWN SAY; THE DECEMBER OLD ENERGY AUCTION WILL, AS 
PEDROSA POINTED OUT, SPEAK VOLUMES ABOUT INDUSTRY 
EXPECTATIONS.  EXISTING GENERATORS, HOWEVER, ARE STUCK, AND 
MUST TO SOME DEGREE MAKE PEACE WITH THE NEW MODEL.  THE 
EARLY-2005 NEW ENERGY AUCTION WILL PROVIDE A MORE 
DEFINITIVE ANSWER, BECAUSE NEW-TO-MARKET INVESTORS WILL BE 
FREE TO AVOID IT ALTOGETHER.

AGAINST TRAFFICKER IN PIRATED GOODS 
 
REF: A) SAO PAULO 1611, B) BRASILIA 1384 
 
1.  The article set forth in paragraph 2 (below) describing 
Federal Police action against the notorious pirated goods 
trafficker Law Kin Chong, appeared in the Saturday, 
November 6 \"O Estado de Sao Paulo\".  Post thought it might 
be of interest to those in Washington who follow the IPR 
developments in Brazil. 
 
2.  (Begin Unofficial Embassy Translation) 
 
Headline: Federal Police Seize R$30 Million in Contraband 
 
More than R$30 million in merchandise suspected of being 
contraband, a factory of pirated watches, and emeralds 
valued at between 1.5 and 6 million Reais were seized 
yesterday by the Federal Police (FP) in Sao Paulo.  It was 
the largest operation against interests allegedly belonging 
to businessman Law Kin Chong since he went to jail in June 
accused of bribing Deputy Luiz Antonio Medeiros (PL-SP), 
who headed the Piracy CPI.  Six people were caught red 
handed, among them two of Law\'s nieces. 
 
The 200 federal agents who participated in Operation 
\"Capela\" served 18 warrants of search and seizure at 9 
addresses.  They had an ambitious objective:  end the 
network of contraband and sale of pirated products 
maintained by Law in Sao Paulo.  It was 08h00 when the 
teams arrived at the five warehouses, three offices and ten 
stores located around Rua 25 de Marco and Bras. 
 
At Rua Bucolismo the agents had to wait until 10h00 to 
enter.  The location had more than 30 leased boxes of which 
10 were opened by the investigators.  There was so much 
material found that the feds had to set up an on-site 
registry to catalog everything.  There were ceramics, 
electronics and toys. 
 
\"The investigation revealed that these locations were 
controlled by or are the property of Law Kin Chong\", 
affirmed Delegado Jose Ivan Guimaraes Lobato, regional 
superintendent of the Federal Police in Sao Paulo.  \"We 
don\'t know if he was operating out of prison in Brasilia, 
but this operation proves that he continues with his 
criminal activity.\" 
 
The emeralds were found in Law\'s office on Rua 25 de Marco. 
The FP is investigating the possibility that they served to 
finance the contraband dealings he is accused of, that\'s 
why they decided to seize them.  \"Their origin is being 
determined\", he said. 
 
On 25 de Marco, the police found expired cosmetics and 
health products being sold.  Because of this, they decided 
to charge the detainees under the Heinous Crimes law. 
According to Det. Lobato, the prisoners will also be 
charged with contraband, forming a gang, fraud, and tax 
evasion.  Intercepted phone records and correspondence 
showed the link between Law and his family with the people 
who, according to the FP, acted as front men in the control 
of the import and export companies and warehouses. 
 
The federal agents even brought a specialist in safe 
cracking so they could get what was kept in Law\'s office on 
the 7th floor of Shopping 25 de Marco.  With a hammer and 
crowbar, the agent took about 15 minutes to do his work. 
The result was seizure of check books, commercial contracts 
and documents from Law\'s companies. 
 
The operation received the name \"Capela\" after the quartz 
blocks sold by a company investigated by the FP, controlled 
by Law\'s wife. 
 
The FP\'s objective was to \"desperately\" create a story to 
maintain Law Kin Chong in prison.  That\'s how Law\'s 
attorney characterized Operation \"Capela\". 
 
He denied any relationship between Law and the warehouses 
of merchandise, allegedly contraband, examined by the 
police.  He also said his client is not connected to the 
factory of pirated watches discovered by FP. 
 
\"FP knows that the Supreme Court will rule shortly on 
habeas-corpus in favor of Law, that\'s why they\'re trying to 
make up a story\", he affirmed.  According to him, the 
emeralds seized by the feds are legal jewels declared by 
Law.  They are guarantee of payment in a suit brought by 
INSS (National Social Security) against one of Law\'s 
companies.  \"The judge accepted them as guarantee of 
payment of the debt and left them in the care of another 
attorney of Law\'s, while the case is being heard\", he 
stated. 
 
According to him, the lot is not worth R$6 million as 
divulged by FP, but R$1.5 million.  Pacheco also affirmed 
that Law has had no contact with his brother Julio Law for 
over ten years, nor therefore, with his nieces who FP 
arrested at the Rua 25 de Marco office.  \"So far, the 
police have failed to show any evidence that Law is, in 
fact, the biggest trafficker of pirated goods in the 
country.\"

1.  (SBU) Summary: President Lula accepted the resignation 
of National Social and Economic Development Bank (BNDES) 
head Carlos Lessa November 18, replacing him with Planning 
and Budget Minister Guido Mantega.  Lessa, a leftist 
economics professor with longstanding ties to Lula and the 
Workers\' Party (PT), had been a thorn in the 
administration\'s side, frequently criticizing administration 
policies, Finance Minister Palocci and Central Bank Chairman 
Meirelles.  While the financial community will celebrate 
Lessa\'s departure, he leaves BNDES a demoralized and 
diminished institution.  Mantega will face significant 
challenges in rebuilding BNDES, an institution with an 
annual budget of over $12 billion.  Names floated in the 
press to replace Mantega at the Planning Ministry include 
Integration Minister Ciro Gomes and Federal Deputy Paulo 
Bernardo.  The episode highlights the extent to which 
Palocci\'s policy line has won the day with the GoB.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Lessa\'s replacement by Mantega is the second 
cabinet change in two weeks (DefMin Viegas was replaced by 
Vice President Alencar on November 8), and it may be 
followed by further cabinet changes in the coming weeks. 
Planning Minister Mantega has been named to replace Lessa at 
BNDES; Mantega\'s replacement has not yet been named.  A few 
other positions are in play, but depend to great extent on 
the outcome of the PMDB\'s internal deliberations on whether 
to stay in the governing coalition (ref B). 
 
Tenure a Disaster 
----------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Lessa\'s tenure at BNDES has been widely described 
as a disaster.  He argued that BNDES should return to its 
roots as a \"development\" bank, financing industrial projects 
and infrastructure as it had during the heyday of the import- 
substitution industrialization push.  Lessa surprised the 
GoB with the purchase of a major stake in privatized mining 
conglomerate CVRD, later justifying the action on the 
grounds that it was a \"strategic\" asset over which the state 
should have some control.  To be fair, despite constant talk 
of a nationalist economic agenda, Lessa did on occasion show 
a practical bent and, for example, supported a debt-for- 
equity swap with U.S. energy firm AES that resolved a sore 
spot in the FDI arena.  Nevertheless, Lessa\'s criticisms of 
administration policy were constant, including last week 
when he called Meirelles\' Central Bank chairmanship a 
\"nightmare.\" 
 
4. (SBU) As bad as the insubordination and constant 
criticism was for the Lula administration, Lessa\'s tenure 
was even worse for BNDES itself.  He shook up the 
institution immediately upon his arrival in early 2003, 
forcing out not only the Bank\'s senior management but senior 
technical level staff as well.  Many other key staff chose 
to leave, hollowing out the bank\'s capabilities.  This was 
reflected in BNDES\' performance, failing to loan out all of 
the resources it had available.  When reproached by Lula and 
asked to speed up BNDES lending operations, Lessa retorted - 
- publicly, through the press -- that BNDES was \"not a 
bakery\" to be handing out its product as quickly as 
possible.  Asked about the firing, one Rio-based economist 
asked us rhetorically, \"What took them so long?\" 
 
Mantega Faces a Challenge 
------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Mantega faces a difficult task at BNDES.  The 
bank\'s best professionals are gone.  Those that remain work, 
according to one contact, in a \"cutthroat\" atmosphere. 
Mantega does have the advantage that he has built a 
productive relationship with the GoB economic team, in 
particular Palocci, since their ministries work closely on 
budget planning and budget execution.  The move to BNDES 
would nominally be a demotion for Mantega, since the 
position does not carry cabinet rank and reports to Minister 
of Industry, Development and Foreign Commerce Furlan. 
Mantega sidestepped the question when asked by the press 
whether he would be reporting to Furlan. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) Lessa\'s defenestration has been widely interpreted 
as strengthening Palocci\'s position within the GoB.  And, 
while the episode clearly illustrates Palocci\'s strength, 
Lessa and his outbursts had ceased long ago to pose any real 
threat to Palocci and the GoB economic team.  Lula 
identified himself publicly with the Palocci/Meirelles 
policy line early on in his administration.  Lula has 
reaffirmed that line at every major economic juncture since. 
Lessa was, by this point, an outlier, one of the few lone 
voices of the old PT left wing left crying in the neo- 
liberal wilderness.  That it took so long to remove him 
speaks more of Lula\'s loyalty to an old comrade than to 
Palocci\'s position, which was already well secured.

 1. (C) Summary. Presidential Foreign Affairs Advisor Marcos 
Aurelio Garcia and his deputy, Marcel Biato, returned from a 
mid-November fact-finding mission to Haiti with the strong 
view that Aristide must not be allowed back into Haitian 
politics under any circumstances, Biato told PolCouns in a 19 
November meeting at the presidency.  The dominant impression 
gathered over several days meeting with multiple sources is 
that Aristide is a criminal who should be prosecuted, but 
still a powerful \"shadow\" over Haiti that inspires both 
terror and ill-founded hopes among many.  Hence Garcia and 
Biato brought back to the GOB the key assessment that the 
\"grand strategic question\" now is how to quickly create hope 
for the future among Haitians that is decoupled from 
Aristide, and specific GOB views outlined below on 
requirements for stability, assistance programs and political 
dialogue flow from that question, according to Biato. The 
highly negative assessment of Aristide by this influential 
advisor to President Lula da Silva will likely inform GOB 
policies and actions henceforth.  End summary. 
 
Aristide: 
-------- 
 
2. (C) Garcia and Biato returned from their mid-November 
fact-finding mission to Haiti with a strong view that 
Aristide must not be allowed back into Haitian politics under 
any circumstances, that he is \"a shadow over the country\" and 
should be \"exorcised,\" if possible by some form of trial in 
Haiti, Biatio told PolCoun.  Biato allowed that Garcia had 
traveled to Haiti believing that Aristide was a political 
reality that might have to be considered as a factor in 
political dialogues.  However, after 27 meetings with 
government officials, diplomats, UN officials, church 
leaders, military sources, and moderate Lavalas figures (who 
would only meet with Garcia after he publicly denounced 
Aristide in Port au Prince), Garcia came away from Haiti 
viewing Aristide as a completely unacceptable actor, \"a 
mobster\" involved in a range of illegal activity who \"orders 
assassinations by cell phone,\" Biato said. 
 
3. (C) Biato (strictly protect on this) said Garcia\'s highly 
negative assessment of Aristide is being heard by Lula and 
the senior GOB leadership, and will be factored into any 
consideration of sending an unofficial Brazilian emissary to 
meet with Aristide (a possibility reported previously in ref 
a).  Instead, Biato opined that the GOB may communicate to 
South African President Mbeki its concerns about the apparent 
freedom Aristide enjoys in inciting violence and provocations 
from his South African enclave. 
 
4. (C) The \"exorcism\" of Aristide is essential because he 
inspires both terror and \"what passes for hope\" among so many 
in Haiti\'s masses, Biato said.  The \"grand strategic question 
is how to create hope for the future among Haitians that is 
not linked to Aristide.\" Biato said.  From that question flow 
several of the specific policy and practical assessments that 
Garcia brought back from his trip, which also tend to 
reinforce the GOB view that progress must move simultaneously 
in establishing stability and order, starting real political 
engagement, amd most importantly, bringing to bear assistance 
projects that have an immediate and positive effect on the 
population.  Progress on all fronts needs to move ahead 
quickly, \"because time is on Aristide\'s side,\" Biato said. 
 
Stability and Public Order: 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The GOB assessed that the threat to general stability 
appears to have diminished after \"Operation Baghdad\" 
dissipated, although crime and disturbances continue. 
MINUSTAH\'s commander indicated to Garcia that force levels 
expected on the ground by the end of the year should be 
sufficient for maintaining general control, Biato said. 
Biato noted that Brazil deployed a plus-up of 250 marines and 
support personnel, 44 vehicles (including armored personnel 
carriers) and provisions on 18 November from Rio. He said the 
GOB is also planning to send an army engineering battalion 
for civil works projects as part of its scheduled December 
rotation.  However, he stressed that the GOB does not plan a 
substantial increase in its MINUSTAH contingent, in part 
owing to domestic political sensitivities about the mission 
in Haiti. 
 
6. (C) Garcia returned concerned about the overall law 
enforcement situation and the dysfunctionality of the 
national police, Biato said, and the GOB will be trying to 
work with others on police training and related initiatives. 
 
Assistance: 
---------- 
 
7. (C) Of the more than one billion dollars in assistance 
potentially available for Haiti, little has started to flow, 
and at the current rate, the GOB fears there will not be 
appreciable progress visible to the public before the 
elections, Biato said.  A main challenge continues to be a 
lack of reliable interlocutors and institutions for turning 
assistance funds into viable projects, so donors are standing 
off, Biato said.  Specific steps the GOB will pursue include: 
 
--The GOB will pressure the EU, U.S. and others to accelerate 
release of funds (e.g., the GOB met with other donors on the 
margins of the Ibero-American summit, FM Amorim spoke to the 
visiting German foreign minister, Garcia spoke recently to 
French officials and Lula will soon call EU Commission 
President Durao Baroso, Biato said). 
 
--Coupled with this, the GOB will urge the UN to place 
competent aid technicians on the ground asap, headed by a 
senior UN official experienced both in large-scale program 
management and dealing with the New York bureaucracy, Biato 
said. 
 
--Biato said the GOB is also planning to approach the World 
Bank regarding a USD 70 million dollar loan that is available 
for Haiti, but not released yet owing to Haiti\'s 50 million 
debt to the Bank.  The GOB, in coordination with Canada, 
plans to loan the IGOH the required 50 million to pay the 
debt off and trigger release of the World Bank loan.  Once 
the GOB is repaid and other adjustments are made, the GOB 
estimates 25 to 30 million would be immediately deployable 
for assistance efforts. 
 
--The GOB is working with Canada and hopes to approach others 
about quickly designing and implementing joint projects in 
health, sanitation and utilization of such resources as Haiti 
has, Biato said.  Biato indicated he will approach the 
Mission about possible U.S.- Brazil joint projects when the 
GOB has developed more specific plans, but opined that the 
single most dramatic U.S. contribution would be an immediate 
adjustment of textile quotas to benefit Haitian producers. 
 
--The GOB alone plans to send Brazilian technicians to assist 
Haitians in enhancing their production of manioc and cashews 
(the island\'s main export).  Brazil will also build a garbage 
recycling facility and plans to invite other donors to 
support it in exporting to Haiti a successful Brazilian 
program for building affordable housing (approximately USD 
1,000 per house). 
 
Political Engagement: 
-------------------- 
 
8. (C) Following Garcia\'s visit the GOB has the view that 
elements of the sprawling Lavalas are willing to be part of a 
national dialogue, if Aristide\'s intimidation efforts can be 
diminished and if what many Lavalas members view as IGOH 
repression is curtailed, Biato said.  Opponents of Lavalas 
also indicated to Garcia that there are \"moderate\" and 
\"intellectual\" elements in Lavalas with whom they would be 
willing to engage.  The UN should expand on this baseline for 
dialogue with a series of conferences on political, economic, 
social and reconciliation topics, Biato said. 
 
9. (C) Biato indicated that the GOB also plans to invite a 
number of political figures from Haiti to a December OAS 
conference in Brasilia on political party development, to 
provide exposure of isolated Haitian political leaders to 
international concepts of democracy and party politics. 
 
10. (C) Garcia left Haiti convinced of the importance of 
concentrating now on election mechanics, Biato said.  The GOB 
will work with others on efforts to make Haiti\'s election 
commission functional and will send to Haiti over 10,000 of 
Brazil\'s highly reliable computer voting machines.  Political 
efforts of all kinds will \"fall into a vacuum,\" however, if 
there is not apparent progress on aid projects, Biato opined. 
 
11. (C) Comment: Garcia is an influential advisor to the 
president and Garcia\'s fact-finding mission to Haiti produced 
a realistic and negative assessment of Aristide that, we 
believe, will inform Lula\'s approach to this issue and GOB 
actions henceforth.  We will be attentive to the possibility 
that the GOB may reach out to Mbeki to underscore their 
concerns about Aristide, and we will also be ready to discuss 
with the GOB any specific assistance proposals they present 
to us for possible bilateral collaboration.

SUBJECT: DEVELOPMENT OF WEBSITE IPR MATERIALS 
 
REF:  SECSTATE 224924 
 
1. Embassy Brasilia offers the following thoughts in 
response to reftel\'s request to consider development of 
post specific, IPR-related web-site materials, citing the 
China \"IPR Toolkit\" as an example.  Please see action 
request in para 5. 
 
2. Brazil is a major market for counterfeit and pirated 
products.  The International Intellectual Property Alliance 
(IIPA) estimates that $785 million were lost by U.S. 
copyright industries alone in 2003 due to piracy; Brazil is 
on USTR\'s special 301 priority watch list.  In 2001, IIPA 
filed a petition to remove trade benefits from Brazil under 
the Generalized System of Preferences; that review is still 
on-going.  Although Brazil\'s patent law is largely TRIPs 
compliant, weak management of the national patent institute 
and a lack of resources over a number of years have 
resulted in an estimated 60,000-70,000 patent application 
backlog. 
 
3. Given the substantial commercial risk in Brazil 
resulting from piracy, counterfeiting, and a stalled patent 
system, post welcomes the suggestion of making information 
on Brazil\'s intellectual property regime available on our 
website in an effort to aid U.S. companies.  However, to 
develop materials in line with the China IPR toolkit, post 
would require financial assistance.  Mission does not have 
any officers who work solely on IPR issues; dedicating 
staff to development of in-house material on the scale of 
the China IPR toolkit would severely undermine our ability 
to cover other essential elements of our work in Brazil. 
To avoid the potential misperception that the USG is 
providing legal advice, we also believe it best that 
detailed guidance be provided by legal professionals. 
 
4.  Mission resources would enable staff to produce an 
overview section on IPR protection in Brazil by February 
next year; post proposes contracting with a local IPR 
law/consulting firm to provide the detailed \"how to\" 
information for each type of IPR protection.  This material 
would draw heavily from and be linked to Brazil\'s National 
Patent Institute (INPI) website, which already has in-depth 
information in English on pertinent laws, regulations, 
international treaties and application/registration 
procedures for the protection of patents, trademarks, and 
industrial designs.  In addition to augmenting the INPI 
information as necessary, the local firm would provide 
detailed \"how-to\" information covering copyright 
protection.   Post estimates the cost of contracting out 
development of such material at around $10,000 with 
turnaround time of one to two months. 
 
5.  Action Request:  Embassy requests that Washington 
agencies consider making funds available for development by 
a local firm of more detailed guidance for protecting 
specific intellectual property rights in Brazil. 
Meanwhile, Post will move forward with drafting an IPR 
overview for placement on the Embassy website, drawing 
heavily from the National Trade Estimate report and Country 
Commercial Guide.

Classified By: Economic Officer Janice Fair, 
Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary and Introduction:  On November 11 
Brazil rolled out the red carpet for Chinese President Hu 
Jintao, in country for a five-day state visit.  Commercial 
issues dominated the bilateral discussions.  In its demand 
that Brazil recognize its \"market economy\" status in 
exchange for trade and investment concessions, China 
played hardball -- and won.  Many in Brazil\'s private sector 
fear -- with reason -- that Brazil was out-negotiated and 
Brazilian manufacturers will ultimately pay the price. 
Although eleven official agreements and six commercial 
agreements were signed, many in Brazil are skeptical about 
the promised commercial pay-off. The Chinese avoided 
making explicit political concessions to Brazil over its bid 
for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council and 
Brazil\'s candidate for the WTO Director General job, 
Ambassador Seixas Correa, although in closed talks the 
PRC gave the GOB implicit support on the former issue. 
Brazil indicated it remained behind the \"one China\" policy 
but refused to press Paraguay, a fellow member of 
Mercosul, to drop its recognition of Taiwan.  Human rights 
were not addressed and for all intents and purposes, the 
Sino-Brazilian Human Rights Commission is dead.  End 
Summary. 
 
A One-Note Samba 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Over 200 government officials and business people 
accompanied President Hu Jintao to Brazil November 11- 
15 in a follow-up to President Lula\'s own five-day state 
visit to Beijing less than six months earlier (refs a and b). 
While the development of a bilateral strategic partnership 
served as the principal theme for Lula\'s trip to Beijing, 
Hu\'s 
visit took a narrower, largely trade and commercial focus. 
According to Brazilian Minister of Development, Industry, 
and Trade Luiz Furlan, the Chinese came to Brazil \"with a 
one-note samba.\"  The simple song paid off.   After 
negotiations lasting 20 hours, described by an experienced 
Ministry of External Relations (MRE) observer to poloffs 
as the most difficult he had ever witnessed, President Lula 
agreed to the Chinese President\'s sole demand -- Brazilian 
recognition of China as a market economy.  (Note:  During 
its WTO accession in 2001, China agreed to designation as 
a non-market economy.  Since then, China has aggressively 
pursued a campaign to convince WTO members to 
designate it as a \"market economy,\" a concession that 
would constrain implementation of safeguard actions and 
anti-dumping cases against its products.  End note) 
 
3.  (C) According to MRE\'s Head of Asia and Oceania 
Division and former DCM in Beijing, Edsen Montero, prior 
to Hu\'s arrival, the GOB was determined stay with a policy 
of not granting market economy status.  As a fallback 
position, it was decided internally the GOB would follow 
the EU position: not designate China a \"market economy\" 
but allow the issue to advance by treating it at a technical 
level.  However, when face-to-face, the Chinese insisted 
that market economy recognition preceded any commercial 
concessions.  After exhaustive talks, political 
considerations eventually trumped commercial ones when 
President Lula -- going against the advice from his 
technical staff in the Ministry of Development, Industry 
and Trade and MRE, both of which argued that Brazilian 
industry would be prejudiced -- decided to make a 
sweeping gesture to Brazil\'s \"strategic partner.\" The 
Brazilians were not unaware of the risks, Montero affirmed, 
and made clear to the Chinese that this was not a license to 
dump products on the Brazilian market. On the trade side 
of the house, Brazilian officials were chagrined by Lula\'s 
decision, with Montero noting that Chinese shirts were for 
sale for as little as two reais ($0.70) in local markets. 
 
Commercial Trade-Offs 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) For its trouble, Brazil was rewarded with the 
promise of a \"privileged status\" and of greater market 
access for Brazilian products.  Even though as an export 
destination China is still a distant second to the United 
States, which absorbed $16.3 billion in Brazilian exports 
through October 2004, growth in trade with China figures 
prominently in Brazil\'s plan\'s for export expansion and 
diversification.  Bilateral trade is up over 330% in just 
five 
years and climbing steeply; China is now Brazil\'s largest 
market for soybeans and other primary products.  In 2003 
Brazilian exports to China more than doubled reaching $4.5 
billion with two-way trade valued at around $6.7 billion; 
already through October 2004, two-way trade for the year 
has reached $7.7 billion. 
 
5.  (C)  However, a more dramatic trade opening between 
the two countries appears unlikely in the near-term. 
Ronaldo Costa Filho, Head of Itamaraty\'s European Union 
and Extra-Regional Negotiations Division told econoff that 
despite talk of a possible FTA during Lula\'s trip to China in 
May, it was not on the agenda for President Hu\'s visit. 
Neither side was pushing to resume discussions on terms of 
reference for an FTA feasibility study that had lapsed since 
July; Costa explained that Brazilian private sector\'s 
extremely, negative reaction to a potential opening to the 
Asian giant had caused the GoB to back-off.  During Hu\'s 
visit, the GoB wanted to pursue more specific trade 
interests and had hoped to advance prospects for higher- 
value added products.  However, only agreements covering 
Brazilian exports of fresh beef and chicken were signed; 
these sanitary agreements will purportedly result in exports 
worth $150 million next year and potentially 
$800 million over the next three years. 
 
6.  (U) A more compelling commercial enticement for 
Brazil was likely China\'s promise to consider investing as 
much as $10 billion in Brazilian infrastructure projects over 
the next couple years.  The GoB has yet to get its public- 
Private Partnership (PPP) legislation through Congress and 
is desperate for infrastructure investment to ease 
bottlenecks that threaten to constrain exports.  The lack of 
a 
set PPP framework has held up Chinese commitment on 
around $2 billion in projects to revamp a North-South rail- 
line and expand the port of Itaqui in Maranhao, projects 
geared toward facilitating exports to China of Brazilian 
soybeans, iron ore and wood.  The Hu visit did produce an 
agreement for construction of a $1.3 billion gas pipeline 
running from Rio Janeiro state to Bahia. 
 
Chinese Mum on Support for Brazilian Seat on UNSC 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
7.   (C) Montero noted that while the Chinese government 
privately backed Brazil\'s bid for a permanent seat on the 
UNSC, the PRC continued its refusal to offer a public 
statement of support.  Instead, he said, China kept to its 
clever \"incomplete syllogism,\" used first during Lula\'s 
Beijing visit in May -- \"the UNSC should be expanded, the 
developing world needs representation on the UNSC, and 
Brazil is a developing nation.\"  A senior Japanese diplomat 
in Brasilia had opined to poloffs that political 
tensions between Japan and China (and to a lesser 
extent, tensions with India) complicated any Chinese 
endorsement of a seat for Brazil. Montero fully agreed with 
this assessment. China\'s endorsement of any one of the 
self-proclaimed candidates for a permanent UNSC seat, he 
believed, would run the risk of alienating non-endorsed 
candidates. 
Comment:  One wonders whether the GOB leadership 
adequately analyzed this paradigm from the PRC 
perspective before conceding on the market economy 
question.  End comment 
 
Backlash 
----------- 
 
8.   (SBU) With the concession on market economy status, 
Brazil became the first Latin American country to accede to 
China\'s demand, as well as the largest anywhere to date. 
Montero agreed that Brazil\'s action could have 
repercussions within Mercosul and elsewhere 
on the continent. Given Brazil\'s economic size 
and regional dominance, the designation is perceived 
here as a major victory for PRC trade policy and a big 
gamble by the GOB.  Despite his earlier remarks that 
China was clearly not a market economy, Minister Furlan 
publicly downplayed the impact of the decision on 
Brazilian industry and claimed Brazil, in return, 
had won significant concessions. But privately, the 
Minister could not have been happy.  Meanwhile, 
negative reaction from Brazil\'s industrial sector 
to the market economy decision was swift.  Sao Paulo\'s 
powerful Federation of Industries (FIESP) issued an 
official note opposing the GOB concession to China, 
arguing that it leaves Brazilian industry highly 
vulnerable.  Sao Paulo will provide more details on 
private sector reaction septel. 
 
9. (U) Conceding market economy status to China will now 
require application of stricter rules in antidumping and 
safeguard cases.  For instance, under rules for antidumping 
investigations, Chinese export prices will be compared with 
its domestic prices, which, FIESP pointed out, do not result 
from market forces.  Brazil currently has 13 anti-dumping 
orders in place against Chinese products, with one more 
pending -- far more than with any other country.  The cases 
cover a variety of products such as small appliances and 
equipment, chemicals, bike tires, etc.  Brazil also has a 
safeguard action against toys from China.  Formally, the 
market economy concession will be reviewed by CAMEX, 
the Brazilian Foreign Trade Board, a process that could 
take several weeks.  Montero agreed it is unlikely that 
CAMEX will reject or overrule the President. 
 
Signed Agreements 
----------------------- 
 
10. (U) Officials agreements: 
1) MOU on trade and investment in which Brazil grants 
\"market economy\" status to China; 
2) Quarantine protocol and sanitary conditions 
for export of beef from Brazil to China; 
3) Quarantine protocol and sanitary conditions

6) Extradition treaty; 
7) Cooperation agreement on fighting organized crime; 
8) MOU for cooperation in the industrial area, including on 
ethanol; 
9) Complementary agreement for the construction of the 
China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS 2B); 
10) Cooperation protocol for marketing images produced 
by the CBERS 2B satellite; and 
11) MOU to facilitate tourism from China to Brazil. 
 
Additional commercial agreements: 
 
1) Cooperation agreement between China\'s Eximbank and 
China Petrochemical Corporation (SINOPEC), and BNDES 
and Petrobras in the $1.3 billion Gasene project to 
run a gas pipeline from Rio de Janeiro to Bahia; 
2) Agreement between Vale do Rio Doce and Yongcheng 
Coal and Electricity and Shanghai Baosteel; 
 3) Joint venture to produce alumina between Vale do Rio 
Doce and Aluminum Corporation of China; 
4) Joint venture between ZhuZhou Rolling Stock Works 
and Mitsui and the Metal-Mechanic Consortium of Espirito 
Santo to produce rail cars; 
5) A basic accord between Eletrobras, Companhia de 
Geracao Termica de Energia Electrica, Citic Group, and 
China Development Bank; and 
6) Purchase of Chinese equipment by Cosipar, financed by 
the Import Bank of China. 
 
Brazil Stands By \"One China\" Policy 
----------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) On the perennial topic of Taiwan, the GOB 
continued to support a one China policy and reaffirmed this 
position with the Chinese.  during the talks, Montero 
pointed out, the PRC kept subtle pressure on the GOB to 
persuade fellow Mercosul partner Paraguay to drop its 
recognition of Taiwan.  The Chinese effort was a non- 
starter, Montero said.  Brazil was not prepared 
to lobby another country on China\'s behalf. 
 
Human Rights, Dead in the Water 
---------------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C) On the subject of China\'s human rights record and 
the moribund Sino-Brazilian Human Rights Commission, 
Montero conceded that the commission was all but dead 
and Brazil\'s ability to influence China non-existent.  The 
topic did not receive attention during President Hu\'s visit. 
The GOB did offer China expert assistance in penal and 
judicial reform and other areas that could help improve 
human rights practices, but the PRC rebuffed all efforts and 
even ignored proposed exchange visits.  In the interest of 
the \"strategic partnership\" and, of course, Brazil\'s UNSC 
bid, Montero could not conceive of Brazil voting in favor 
of a China human rights resolution.  Instead, Brazil will 
continue its policy of abstention on any UN effort to 
criticize China\'s approach to human rights.  Montero agreed 
it was ironic that it took a mistaken GOB human rights vote 
against China in 1997 to launch the bilateral commission in 
the first place, and he wryly smiled when asked whether a 
change in Brazil\'s future votes could actually 
improve GOB leverage over China. 
 
Comment 
------------ 
 
13.  (C) What swayed the GOB to concede market 
economy status?  And did Brazil get enough concessions to 
justify it?  On the positive side of the commercial ledger, 
proposed Chinese investment is concentrated in 
transportation infrastructure projects and easing 
transportation bottlenecks is crucial for Brazil to continue 
its export drive.  The GoB expects China to keep its 
promises, since to further its global lobbying effort on 
market economy status it will not want to be seen as 
stabbing Brazil in the back.  Nonetheless, local analysts are 
skeptical that the promised mega-investments will 
materialize and are wary of Chinese claims of market 
opening.  The Brazilian agricultural community is still 
smarting over China\'s refusal to accept shipments of 
Brazilian soybeans due to alleged fungicide contamination 
just before President Lula\'s visit to that country in May. 
Brazil reportedly lost $1 billion in trade due to that 
episode. 
Agriculture Minister Roberto Rodrigues described the new 
agreements on beef and chicken as advances, but as with 
soybeans, trade in these commodities will be subject to the 
vagaries of China\'s sanitary and phytosanitary regime. 
14.  (C) But there was obviously more at stake in the final 
political analysis. China is a critical partner in President 
Lula\'s drive to \"change the geography of trade\" and to 
realign agendas within a range of international institutions 
to reflect developing countries\' interests. The President 
felt 
that giving in to China on the market economy issue could 
cement the political relationship, seen as vital for 
obtaining 
these and other strategic objectives, such as a permanent 
seat for Brazil on the UNSC.  Yet, if the GOB decision to 
give in to China on market economy status was seen as a 
quid pro quo for public Chinese support for 
a permanent Brazilian seat on the UNSC, the 
strategy did not pan out.

1.  (SBU) Summary and Introduction:  During his November 22 
visit to Brazil, Russian President Vladimir Putin endorsed 
Brazil\'s bid for a permanent UNSC seat and received from 
Brazilian President Lula reciprocal support for Russia\'s 
accession to the WTO.  However, neither side achieved its 
principal objective from the talks: for Brazil, an end to the 
Russian embargo on Brazilian beef, and for Russia, Brazilian 
agreement to select from among five competitors the Sukhoi 
Su-35 for its next generation fighter aircraft (F-X). In an 
agreement that had been prepared months earlier, the two 
countries signed an umbrella MOU for cooperation in 
developing Brazil\'s space program.  A successful visit, 
perhaps, but far less intense -- and arguably less important 
-- than the visit to Brazil of Chinese President Hu Jintao a 
week earlier.  End Summary 
 
Two Backs Lightly Scratched 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) The first visit of a Russian leader to Brazil 
contained much upbeat rhetoric, good photo ops (such as a 
Putin appearance at soccer\'s holy ground, Rio\'s Maracana 
Stadium), but offered little substance.  With Putin\'s 
blessing, Brazil received Russian endorsement for a permanent 
seat on the UNSC. Lula reciprocated with Brazilian support 
for Russia\'s WTO accession. Neither action was unexpected, 
and neither was much of a concession.  During earlier high 
level visits to Moscow, Brazil had already received quiet 
assurances of Russian support for its UNSC bid. Brazil, also, 
sacrificed little by offering support to Russia for 
membership in the WTO. In backing Russia, Lula presented a 
vision of a \"truly advanced development policy,\" while Putin 
boosted Brazil as \"the largest country in Latin America and a 
strategic partner.\"  The two countries, Putin noted, have 
almost no \"contradictions\" in foreign policy and hold similar 
approaches to key international issues, which makes the two 
\"almost allies.\" 
 
Lula Asks \"Where\'s the Beef?\" 
\"Come Fly with Me\" Putin Responds 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Almost allies, perhaps, but not totally bosom 
buddies. Citing sanitary concerns over foot-and-mouth disease 
(FMD), the GOR banned imports of all types of Brazilian beef 
in September (which, depending on the complaining source, 
costs Brazil anywhere from between $1 and $4 million/day in 
lost sales).  In a \"sign of good will,\" Russia agreed to lift 
the ban on beef from the disease-free state of Santa 
Catarina; beef imports from the rest of the country, however, 
remain embargoed. Defending its cattle industry, Brazil 
argued that the infected cattle were only from the northern 
state of Amazonas; all other regions are disease-free with 
vaccination, except for Santa Catarina, which is free without 
vaccination. The two leaders issued a joint statement that 
both parties are working to sort the issue out. 
 
4.  (SBU) Meanwhile, regarding the selection of Brazil\'s next 
generation jet fighter (F-X), the GOB decided at the present 
time not to take the Russian offer for purchase of 12 Sukhoi 
SU-35 \"Super Flanker\" jet fighters, even with the Russian 
sweetener -- purchase of 50 Embraer passenger aircraft. 
(Note: Based on press reports, this deal appeared to have 
been supported by Vice President -- now also Defense Minister 
-- Jose Alencar during his October visit to Russia. End note) 
 Instead, Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Marco Aurelio 
Garcia told the press that a decision on the long-running F-X 
competition will not come before 2005. 
 
5.  (U) In an expected deliverable, Russia and Brazil signed 
a MOU on cooperation on Brazil\'s nascent space program, 
centered at the Brazilian launch facility at Alcantara. The 
MOU discusses joint development of a newer version of 
Brazil\'s satellite launch rocket and geostationary satellites 
to be used for communications and navigation. The Russians 
will also help Brazil improve the infrastructure at 
Alcantara. Agreement on a broad umbrella accord had been 
reached months earlier. Unlike Brazil\'s recent accord with 
Ukraine, the MOU is not a technical safeguards agreement. 
 
6.  (SBU) Comment:  The Putin visit provided Brazil as good 
an excuse as any to close an F-X deal with the Russians, if 
it so desired.  Evidently, it did not. The GOB decision not 
to announce selection of the Sukhoi, or any other aircraft -- 
to kick the F-X can down the road yet again -- reinforces our 
belief that the Lula administration still suffers from 
sticker shock for the fighters (roughly $700 million for 12 
aircraft.) 
 
7.  (SBU) Comment cont.: Coming on the heels of Chinese 
President Hu Jintao\'s vaunted five-day visit, and in the 
midst of other presidential-level delegations from Canada, 
Vietnam, South Korea and Morocco, the visit of President 
Putin appears to have met with far less concentrated 
attention than it would otherwise have received.  Certainly, 
it cannot compare with the intense negotiations that took 
place a week earlier with the Chinese.  From a trade 
perspective, perhaps, the visit received the attention it 
deserved. While bilateral trade in 2003 between Brazil and 
Russia reached over $2 billion, it is still well less than 
one-third the level with China -- and only an eighth of trade 
with the U.S.

THE GOB\'S DIGITAL FUTURE 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  ON NOVEMBER 4, 
AMBASSADOR PAID A COURTESY CALL ON MINISTER OF 
COMMUNICATIONS EUNICIO OLIVEIRA.  IN RESPONSE TO THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S PITCH FOR THE GOB TO CONSIDER FAVORABLY THE US 
STANDARD FOR DIGITAL TELEVISION, THE MINISTER REPLIED THAT 
BRAZIL WAS KEEPING ITS OPTIONS OPEN.  THE GOB WOULD BE 
DISPOSED TO ADOPT A FOREIGN-DEVELOPED DIGITAL TV STANDARD, 
OLIVEIRA OBSERVED, IF: A) THAT STANDARD SUPPORTED GOB 
EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A DIGITAL BACKBONE LINKING FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, SCHOOLS, AND LIBRARIES, AND B) A 
PORTION OF THE NECESSARY HARDWARE/SOFTWARE COULD BE 
MANUFACTURED/DEVELOPED IN BRAZIL.  MEANWHILE, RUMORS 
CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE THAT OLIVEIRA, A FEDERAL DEPUTY WHO 
PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS LEADER OF THE PMDB PARTY IN THE 
CHAMBER, WOULD STEP DOWN IF THE PMDB PARTY LEAVES THE 
RULING COALITION.  SEPARATELY, OFFICIALS AT ANATEL, THE 
GOB\'S TELECOM REGULATORY AGENCY, STRESS THAT WHILE THEY 
TAKE PART IN INTER-AGENCY DISCUSSIONS ON DIGITAL ISSUES, 
THE MINISTRY HAS THE LEAD ON THESE MATTERS.  END SUMMARY 
AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
DIGITAL TV STANDARD 
------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) ON NOVEMBER 4, AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY 
ECONCOUNS AND FCS DEPUTY SENIOR COMMERICAL OFFICER, MET 
WITH MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS EUNICIO OLIVEIRA AND HIS 
INTERNATIONAL ADVISOR CLAUDIO NASCIMENTO.  THE CORDIAL 45- 
MINUTE CONVERSATION FOCUSED ON THE STATUS OF THE GOB\'S 
DELIBERATIONS REGARDING THE ADOPTION OF A NEW DIGITAL 
TELEVISION STANDARD.  (BRAZIL IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS 
OF CHOOSING FROM ONE OF POTENTIAL THREE DTV STANDARDS:  THE 
ATSC - I.E., AMERICAN), THE DVB - I.E., EUROPEAN), AND THE 
ISDB - I.E., JAPANESE).  THE MINISTER NOTED THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S INTERNAL DECISIONMAKING ON THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN 
ONGOING SINCE 2000, AND THAT ONE OF THE REASONS PROGRESS 
HAS BEEN SLOW IS THAT THE GOB WANTED TO ENSURE THAT 
WHATEVER STANDARD WAS ADOPTED ALSO SUPPORTED THE 
ADMINISTRATION\'S PLANNED DIGITAL INCLUSION EFFORTS. 
CURRENT PLANNING WAS TO LINK LIBRARIES, SCHOOLS, AND 
SIMILAR TYPE FACILITES TOGETHER VIA A DIGITAL BACKBONE, 
OLIVEIRA SAID, AND IT ONLY SEEMED NATURAL THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SEEK AS MUCH SYNERGY AS POSSIBLE WITH RESPECT TO 
DTV. 
 
3. (SBU) A FURTHER COMPLICATED FACTOR, OLIVEIRA ADDED, WAS 
THE LINE OF THOUGHT THAT BRAZIL SHOULD ADOPT ITS OWN ONE- 
COUNTRY STANDARD, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO 
ENSURE THAT THE STANDARD CHOSEN WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE 
DIGITAL INCLUSION PROJECT.  HOWEVER, THE MINISTER CONTINUED 
(CHOOSING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY), SHOULD TECHNICAL STUDY 
REVEAL THAT THE ATSC STANDARD SATISFIED GOB CONCERNS 
REGARDING SUPPORT FOR DIGITAL INCLUSION, THERE WOULD BE A 
GOOD CASE FOR CHOOSING THAT STANDARD.  HE COMMENTED THAT IT 
WOULD BE EVEN MORE HELPFUL TO US LOBBYING IF U.S. FIRMS 
COULD SHOW THAT THEY PLANNED TO MANUFACTURE AND/OR DEVELOP 
SOME OF THE NECESSARY HARDWARE/SOFTWARE FOR DTV IN BRAZIL. 
OLIVEIRA SAID THAT THE GOB WAS OPEN TO RECEIVING WHATEVER 
TECHNICAL INFORMATION THAT THE USG OR SPECIFIC U.S. FIRMS 
WANTED TO OFFER REGARDING THE ASTC STANDARD. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT.  WHILE THE MINISTER\'S STATEMENTS ABOUT 
BRAZIL HAVING AN OPEN MIND ON THIS ISSUE WERE GOOD NEWS, 
THE PICTURE IS A BIT MORE COMPLICATED.  ACCORDING TO THE 
LOCAL RUMOR MILL, OLIVEIRA - WHO PREVIOUSLY WAS THE CHAMBER 
OF DEPUTIES\' FLOOR LEADER FOR THE PMDB PARTY (ONE OF THE 
LULA GOVERNMENT\'S COALITION PARTNERS) - WOULD STEP DOWN AS 
MINISTER SHOULD THE PMDB DESERT THE GOVERNING COALITION. 
THE PRESS REPORTS THAT WHILE WITHIN PARTY STRATEGY SESSIONS 
HE IS AMONG THOSE ARGUING IN FAVOR OF CONTINUED PMDB 
PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNMENT, SHOULD HIS ARGUMENTS FAIL 
TO CARRY THE DAY THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY SUCCESSOR 
WOULD HAVE THE SAME ATTITUDE ON THE DTV ISSUE.  INDEED, 
BOTH OLIVEIRA AND OUR CONTACTS AT ANATEL (THE GOB TELECOM 
REGULATORY AGENCY) NOTED THAT THERE ARE SOME WITHIN THE PT 
(THE PRESIDENT\'S PARTY) WHO STRONGLY FAVOR A HOME-GROWN 
BRAZIL STANDARD.  END COMMENT. 
 
5. (SBU) MEANWHILE, IN A SEPARATE MEETING THE SAME DAY WITH 
ANATEL CHIEF PRESIDENT ZILLER, EMBOFFS TOUCHED UPON THE 
SAME ISSUE.  ZILLER SAID THAT THE GOB\'S DECISION REGARDING 
THE CHOICE OF A DTV STANDARD WAS BEING MADE BY AN 
INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE (HEADED BY THE MINISTER OF 
COMMUNICATIONS) AND THAT IT WAS CONTEMPLATED THAT THE 
MATTER WOULD BE RESOLVED IN 2005.  NOTE:  U.S. FIRMS 
INTERESTED IN THE BRAZILIAN DTV MARKET HAVE TOLD US THAT 
THE LOCAL BROADCAST INDUSTRY IS PRESSURING THE GOB TO MEET 
THIS 2005 DEADLINE.  BRAZILIAN BROADCASTERS ARE FACING 
INCREASING COMPETITION FOR SCARCE ADVERTISING REVENUE FROM 
CELLULAR PHONE COMPANIES -- WHO ARE NOW CAPABLE OF 
PROVIDING TELEVISION SIGNALS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. 
 
THE FIXED LINE MARKET 
--------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) ANATEL PRESIDENT ZILLER ALSO PROVIDED THE CURRENT 
STATE-OF-PLAY FOR EMBOFFS ON VARIOUS OTHER TELECOM ISSUES. 
WITH RESPECT TO WIRED TELEPHONY, HE NOTED THAT A NUMBER OF 
CURRENT CONCESSIONS WOULD EXPIRE NEXT YEAR.  THE GOB, HE 
SAID, HOPED TO THEN RENEW THEM FROM 2006 TO 2025, WITH 
ANATEL ITSELF WORKING TO INCREASE PORTABILITY OF FIXED 
LINES, ESTABLISH A PRICING MODEL FOR INTERCONNECTIVITY, PUT 
IN PLACE TELEPHONE METERS FOR RESIDENTIAL LINES, AND 
ESTABLISH A NEW AND SEPARATE PRICE INDEX (I.E., OTHER THAN 
THE CURRENT IPCA OR IGI-P) FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
SECTOR.  ZILLER DID NOT SEE VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL 
(VOIP) AS AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE FIXED LINE COMPANIES 
THOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT A NUMBER OF COMPANIES WHICH HAD 
THEIR OWN DATA LINKS WERE MOVING TO THIS TECHNOLOGY.  WHILE 
ANATEL HAD NOT FULLY THOUGHT THROUGH HOW IT WOULD APPROACH 
VOIP - I.E., WAS IT A TECHNOLOGY OR A SERVICE - CURRENT LAW 
PROHIBITS USE OF VOIP ON GOVERNMENT TRANSMISSION LINES, HE 
OBSERVED.  COMMENT.  NOTWITHSTANDING THIS LEGAL 
PROHIBITION, SEVERAL COMPANIES PUBLICLY ADVERTISE CUT-RATE 
INTERNATIONAL AND LONG-DISTANCE PRICES BASED ON THEIR USE 
OF VOIP.  END COMMENT. 
 
MOBILE TELEPHONY 
---------------- 
 
7. (SBU) FINALLY, ZILLER STATED THAT ANATEL WAS WORKING ON 
A STUDY OF THIRD GENERATION MOBILE TELEPHONY THAT SHOULD BE 
READY BY THE FIRST SEMESTER OF 2005.  CURRENTLY, ABOUT 50 
PERCENT OF THE WIRELESS PHONES IN BRAZIL USED TDMA 
TECHNOLOGY, THOUGH OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IT WAS EXPECTED 
THAT CELLULAR PROVIDERS WOULD MIGRATE TO CDMA AND GSM 
TECHNOLOGY.  WHILE ANATEL, WHICH SAW ITS REGULATORY ROLE AS 
THAT OF A NEUTRAL REFEREE, WAS NOT ENCOURAGING THIS 
MOVEMENT, BASED UPON CURRENT TRENDS HE FELT THAT SUCH 
MIGRATION WAS INEVITABLE.

SUBJECT: JUVENILE DETENTION IN BRAZIL:  A LOOK AT 
BRASILIA\'S CAJE FACILITY 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY:  On November 24, Poloffs called on Iolete 
Carvalho, the Director of Brasilia\'s juvenile detention 
facility, CAJE.  CAJE houses 375 youths who range from 12- 
20 years of age.  Director Carvalho answered Poloffs\' 
questions and gave a thorough tour of the physical plant. 
Despite numerous unflattering press reports and scathing 
criticism by Federal District Representative Erika Kokay, 
Poloffs found the facilities, as presented, to be 
acceptable.  Carvalho appeared, however, reluctant to 
discuss the problematic elements of running CAJE such as 
the violence so prevalent in Brazilian detention 
facilities.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------ 
NOT QUITE HEAVEN. 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U) Director Carvalho eagerly presented Poloffs with 
statistics and facts related to her institution.  Like most 
detention centers in Brazil, CAJE is overcrowded, housing 
375 youths (26 of whom were females) even though its 
official capacity is 196.  The facility keeps a mere 15 
guards on staff, none of whom carry weapons more lethal 
than a police baton.  Detainees serve a maximum of three 
years, with the average stay lasting around 2.5 years.  The 
most common offense, according to  Carvalho, is violent 
robbery. 
 
3.  (U) A key source of criticism of CAJE has been Federal 
District Representative Erika Kokay (PT).  Following a 
request for more information on CAJE, Rep. Kokay\'s office 
sent Poloffs an acerbic dossier faulting CAJE for, inter 
alia, an inadequate physical plant, gross understaffing, 
rampant violence, and unsatisfactory treatment of mentally 
ill internees.  Most recently, alleges the Representative, 
a mentally ill detainee slipped through the bureaucratic 
cracks and committed suicide in September 2004 by hanging 
himself.  The compilation of press clippings, 
correspondences, and studies presented to Poloffs also 
details a rash of five internee deaths (some violent), all 
of which occurred in late 2003-early 2004.  These deaths 
took place before  Carvalho\'s tenure began in March of 
2004. 
 
----------------- 
NOR THE INFERNO. 
----------------- 
 
4.  (U) In contrast with the overcrowding, understaffing, 
and danger, Poloffs observed a well-functioning facility 
that, at least during the visit, appeared to be orderly and 
decent.  The detainees, explained the Director, divide 
their days between classes, sports, and professional 
development.  Professional development activities witnessed 
included auto mechanics, computer technology, and the 
culinary arts.  Poloffs also observed classes and physical 
activity, both of which appeared to proceed satisfactorily. 
Between scheduled activities, the youths are allotted free 
time in their respective wings.  Carvalho estimated that 
detainees spend approximately nine hours a day engaged in 
activities outside their cells. 
 
5.  (U) Health facilities seemed adequate and included 
several beds and an in-house dentist.  CAJE, noted Carvalho 
employs two doctors who work normal hours along with a 
cadre of nurses who provide 24 hour on-call medical 
support.  The Director also pointed out that CAJE provides 
a staff of 22 social workers and 15 psychologists to 
address mental health issues. 
 
6.  (U) Internees receive visits from parents and other 
loved ones once a week.  CAJE, according to the Director, 
not only encourages, but claims to mandate such visits to 
ensure that the detainees will have stable relationships to 
support their post-CAJE lives.  Those wishing to make phone 
calls must first interface with staffers, who dial and 
cross-check numbers with available lists of family members 
before handing over the receiver. 
 
------------------------- 
BUT PERHAPS IN PURGATORY 
------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) CAJE Director Carvalho, who has occupied her 
current position for only eight months, seemed unwilling to 
discuss the institution\'s dangerous reputation.  She was, 
though, clearly eager to refute the unsavory image put 
forth by Rep. Kokay and fomented in the media, a process 
which took place before her tenure.  Indeed, the facility 
presented to Poloffs seemed unexpectedly acceptable, 
especially given the dismal reputation of Sao Paulo\'s FEBEM 
system of juvenile detention (see 2003 Human Rights Report 
for Brazil). 
 
8.  (U) COMMENT:  CAJE, like any Brazilian governmental 
appendage, must contend with scant resources and the 
caprice of political currents.  While harsh criticism of 
CAJE is partially the product of a proliferate media and 
the efforts of Rep. Kokay, the claims of understaffing and 
overcrowding certainly merit attention and remedy.  Given 
that the violence documented by Rep. Kokay and her staff 
occurred before Director Carvalho\'s taking office, it could 
be the case that CAJE has moved on to more decent and 
stable footing.  Whether or not CAJE can continue to 
reflect this assessment remains to be seen.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NEXT STEPS ON OPIC-RELATED INVESTMENT PROBLEM IN 
SANEPAR 
 
REF: A) BRASILIA 808 - Notal  B) OPIC EMAILS 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: The case of Parana State sanitation 
utility SANEPAR, in which the U.S. Overseas Private 
Investment Corporation (OPIC) holds an indirect $18 million 
stake, remains a potential problem in the bilateral 
relationship.  The Brazilian Federal Government (GoB) 
repeatedly has said that it has no legal leverage over the 
Governor of Parana State, Roberto Requiao, who has abrogated 
a Shareholders Agreement that gave private shareholders in 
SANEPAR some say over management decisions and diluted their 
ownership stake (reftels).  Legal action challenging the 
abrogation has been dragging through state-level courts, 
which the private shareholders fear have been subject to 
political pressure.  Given substantial French and Spanish 
holdings in SANEPAR, Post proposes further action on 
parallel tracks:  1) a joint French-Spanish-USG approach to 
the GoB; and, 2) pursuit, by the private shareholders, of 
action through the Brazilian SEC-equivalent (CVM) to 
challenge the dilution of the private shareholder stake. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Background:  OPIC, through a credit to the Global 
Environmental Emerging Markets Fund II (GEEMF II), is a 
financial investor in a joint venture called Domino, which 
in turn holds a minority stake in SANEPAR.  In addition to 
GEEMF II, the Domino consortium include Proactiva (a joint 
venture of French multinational Vivendi and Spanish firm 
FCC), Brazilian construction company Andrade Gutierrez, 
(Brazil\'s largest construction firm) and Opportunity Daleth, 
another financial investor (which includes a CitiBank hedge 
fund).  The GEEMF II invested $18 million in SANEPAR, via 
Domino, during a 1998 privatization, in which Domino 
obtained 39.7% of SANEPAR shares.  Domino\'s minority stake 
gave it, through a Shareholders Agreement, the right to 
nominate three of the seven SANEPAR executive officers.  In 
February 2003, newly-elected Parana governor Requiao 
unilaterally abrogated the Shareholder Agreement.  Court 
action fighting the abrogation has been dragging on in state 
courts since then.  In January 2004, SANEPAR undertook a 
debt-for-equity swap with the state government that diluted 
the minority shareholders\' stakes. 
 
French (and Spanish) Connection 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Emboffs met November 12 with French Embassy 
Economic Minister Patrick Berger, Commercial Counselor Marie- 
Cecile Tardieu-Smith, and Financial Counselor, Roger Jean 
Belbenoit, to discuss the Sanepar case.  Berger explained 
that the French Embassy has been advocating on behalf of 
Vivendi in the Sanepar case for some time.  The French 
Ambassador wrote letters to, and met with, Finance Minister 
Palocci, the Minister of Cities and Governor Requiao himself 
to protest Requiao\'s actions.  However, Governor Requiao had 
not given the French Ambassador any satisfaction, while the 
GoB told the French (as they have told us) that it has no 
legal leverage over the governor. 
 
4.  (SBU) Vivendi, according to Berger, has decided to sell 
its interest in to its Spanish partner, FCC.  Berger said 
the French Embassy would nevertheless be interested in a 
joint approach with the US and the Spanish Embassies to 
press for GoB action in the case.  Berger suggested that the 
three Ambassadors send a letter to the Minister of Finance 
emphasizing the damage to Brazil\'s investment climate that 
Requiao was causing.  Berger agreed it would be useful to 
send a copy to the CVM.  Berger nevertheless opined that he 
felt that it was very unlikely that the GoB will take any 
action. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (SBU) We believe that the GoB is correct when it claims 
it has no legal grounds to intervene to overturn Governor 
Requiao\'s abrogation of the Shareholders\' Agreement. 
Moreover, the legal recourse has not yet been exhausted. 
This leaves the GoB only moral and political suasion to use 
to challenge Requiao, unfortunately a weapon to which he 
seems immune.  That said, the attempt should be made and a 
joint approach with the French and Spanish to the GoB that 
emphasizes the investment climate damage Requiao is causing 
is our best shot at a GoB political-level effort.  Raising 
the potential impact of this case on the GoB\'s ability to 
launch successfully the private public partnership program 
may find some resonance with the GoB given its urgent need 
to rebuild decaying infrastructure, including infrastructure 
that supports export expansion.  There should be a parallel 
approach, led by the private shareholders, to challenge with 
the CVM to the dilution of the private shareholders\' equity. 
Copying the three Ambassadors\' letter to the CVM could 
usefully reinforce the private shareholders\' approach.

2. (SBU) BRAZIL ENJOYS CLOSE RELATIONS WITH CUBA AND IS 
RELUCTANT TO CRITICIZE PUBLICLY THE HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES 
OF THE CASTRO REGIME, ALTHOUGH BEHIND THE SCENES THE 
BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT IS OFTEN CRITICAL OF BOTH CUBA\'S LACK 
OF DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  SENIOR 
LEADERS IN THE LULA ADMINISTRATION AND THE PT (I.E., THE

SOUGHT REFUGE IN CUBA, AND TODAY THOSE SAME INDIVIDUALS ARE 
SENSITIVE NOT TO BITE THE HAND THAT SHELTERED THEM.  BRAZIL 
CONSISTENTLY ABSTAINS ON UN RESOLUTIONS CRITICAL OF CUBA\'S

JOURNALISTS TEND TO BE LESS RETICENT THAN THE BRAZILIAN 
GOVERNMENT IN CRITICIZING CASTRO AND CUBA\'S OVERALL 
TREATMENT OF OPPONENTS TO THE REGIME. IN EARLY 2004, THE 
BRAZILIAN PRESS ATTACKED THE GOB\'S FAILURE TO CRITICIZE THE 
HARSH SENTENCING DEALT OUT TO CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS; 
AT THAT TIME, THE BRAZILIAN SENATE PASSED A PUBLIC 
RESOLUTION CRITICAL OF THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT\'S CRACKDOWN ON 
THE DISSIDENTS. 
 
3. (SBU) IN RECENT YEARS, BILATERAL TRADE BETWEEN CUBA AND 
BRAZIL HAS FLUCTUATED AROUND THE USD 100 MILLION LEVEL. 
BRAZIL\'S PRINCIPAL EXPORT ITEMS TO CUBA ARE CHICKEN, SHOES, 
AND AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY.  BRAZIL\'S ANNUAL PURCHASES FROM 
CUBA HAVE HOVERED IN THE USD 10 MILLION RANGE, AND 
PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF DRUGS AND VACCINES.  ACCORDING TO 
PRESS SOURCES, A BRAZILIAN COMPANY \"BUSSCAR\" BASED IN SANTA 
CATARINA STATE IS ENGAGED IN A JOINT VENTURE IN CUBA WITH 
UNECAMOTO (THE CUBAN AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY), CO-PRODUCING 
BUSES FOR SALES IN CUBA AND CENTRAL AMERICA.  ANOTHER 
ACTIVE JOINT VENTURE IS BRASCUBA, A TOBACCO PRODUCTION 
INITIATIVE OWNED BY THE CUBA TOBACCO UNION (UNION DE 
EMPRESAS DEL TABACO DE CUBA) AND SOUZA CRUZ DE BRASIL (A 
BRAZILIAN SUBSIDIARY OF THE BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO 
COMPANY.)  IN ADDITION, CIMEX, S.A. (THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT\'S 
IMPORT/EXPORT ARM) HAS, ALONG WITH SEVERAL BRAZILIAN FIRMS, 
FORMED A JOINT VENTURE - BRACIMEX - DESIGNED TO STIMULATE 
BILATERAL TRADE.  FINALLY, THE BRAZILIAN STATE PETROLEUM

RESCUE PACKAGE.  IF VARIG IS TO SURVIVE, ULTIMATELY A CASH- 
RICH OUTSIDE INVESTOR WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE A STAKE IN THE 
COMPANY AND NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT WITH THE CARRIER\'S 
CREDITORS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CLEAR SKIES BUT WITH PATCHES OF TURBULENCE 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) BASED ON RECENT STATISTICS, THE BRAZILIAN CIVIL 
AVIATION INDUSTRY IS ENJOYING A GOOD YEAR.  JANUARY TO 
AUGUST 2004 FIGURES SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS 
TRANSPORTED INCREASED 11.4 PERCENT COMPARED TO THE 
CORRESPONDING PERIOD LAST YEAR, AND DOMESTIC SALES FOR 2003 
STOOD AT 8.78 BILLION REAIS - UP FROM 7.98 BILLION IN 2002. 
AS A WHOLE, THE SECTOR WENT FROM A DEFICIT OF 698 MILLION 
REAIS IN  2002 TO A PROFIT OF 368 MILLION IN 2003. 
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE POSITIVE OVERALL RESULTS, TWO PRIVATE 
SECTOR BRAZILIAN CARRIERS - VARIG AND VASP - ARE IN DEEP 
TROUBLE. 
 
VASP\'S TROUBLES 
------------ 
 
4. (U) ONCE RESPONSIBLE FOR 36 PERCENT OF THE BRAZILIAN 
MARKET AND IN COMMAND OF A FLEET OF 62 AIRCRAFT, NOW VASP 
IS HOUNDED BY CREDITORS AND BARELY FUNCTIONING.  CURRENTLY, 
THE CARRIER HAS ONLY 17 PLANES IN-SERVICE, NO INTERNATIONAL 
ROUTES, AND A MERE 8.6 PERCENT OF THE MARKET.  THE COMPANY 
HAS DEBTS OF NEARLY 3 BILLION REAIS (OVER USD 1 BILLION), 
AND RECENT HIKES IN FUEL PRICES HAVE ONLY MADE THE 
CARRIER\'S SITUATION EVEN MORE PRECARIOUS.  ITS PILOTS 
PERIODICALLY GO ON STRIKE BECAUSE OF UNPAID BACK WAGES, 
CAUSING THE MASS CANCELLATION OF THE AIRLINE\'S FLIGHTS.  AS 
A RESULT, TRAVEL AGENCIES HAVE SHIED AWAY FROM BOOKING 
CLIENTS ON VASP, AND THE AIRLINE\'S LOAD FACTOR HAS FALLEN 
TO 49 PERCENT (THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS 68 PERCENT).  THE 
NATIONAL AIRPORT AUTHORITY (INFRAERO) IS DEMANDING CASH UP 
FRONT TO PAY LANDING FEES PRIOR TO ANY FLIGHT DEPARTING, 
AND HAS THREATENED TO BAR VASP PLANES FROM FLYING IF THE 
AIRLINE DOES NOT MAKE ITS ACCOUNT CURRENT.  VASP OWES 
INFRAERO ALONE 774 MILLION REAIS.  UNABLE TO FIND ANY BANK 
WILLING TO LEND THE COMPANY MONEY, VASP OWNER WAGNER 
CANHEDO HAS SOLD HOTEL PROPERTIES HE OWNS AND EVEN CATTLE 
FROM HIS RANCH TO PAY DEBT. 
 
5. (SBU) EARLIER IN THE YEAR, THE GOB CIVIL AVIATION 
AUTHORITY (DAC) RECENTLY GROUNDED 6 OF VASP\'S 737-200S FOR 
HAVING SURPASSED STRUCTURAL SAFETY LIMITS, AND LACKING IN 
MONEY TO PAY MAINTENANCE THE CARRIER HAS HAD TO WITHDRAW 
OTHER AIRCRAFT FROM ITS ACTIVE FLEET.  CURRENTLY, VASP IS 
STUCK FLYING ELDERLY AIRCRAFT (ITS FLEET HAS AN AVERAGE AGE 
OF 25 YEARS), WHICH, ACCORDING TO ITS COMPETITORS, ONCE NEW 
GOB ALTITUDE SEPARATION RULES (RVSM) GO INTO EFFECT JANUARY 
1, WILL NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT TO FLY SAFELY OVER 
30,000 FEET.  THIS LAST PROBLEM COULD WELL BE THE DEATH 
KNELL FOR VASP AS THE COST OF EQUIPPING THE CARRIER\'S AGING 
AIRCRAFT WITH RVSM WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE, WHILE THE EXTRA 
FUEL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FLYING UNDER 30,000 FEET WOULD 
MAKE THAT ALTERNATIVE EQUALLY UNATTRACTIVE. 
 
VARIG\'S WOES 
------------ 
 
6. (SBU) VARIG\'S SITUATION, WHILE NOT AS DIRE, IS SERIOUS 
AS WELL.  THE PRESS REPORTS THAT THE COMPANY IS MIRED IN 7 
BILLION REAIS WORTH OF DEBT, A GOOD CHUNK OF WHICH IT IS 
UNABLE TO SERVICE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RUN 
LOSSES.  ACCORDING TO ONE INDUSTRY SOURCE, MUCH OF VARIG\'S 
DEBT MOUNTAIN IS DUE TO MISMANAGEMENT AS COMPANY OFFICIALS 
NEGLECTED TO HEDGE THEIR DOLLAR-BASED LOANS PRIOR TO THE 
SHARP DECLINE OF THE REAL IN THE LATE 1990S.  AN OFFICIAL 
FROM ONE COMPETITOR AIRLINE NOTED THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING 
RECENT BELT-TIGHTENING, VARIG WOULD NEED 20 YEARS OF 
EXCELLENT PROFITS (WITH NONE OF ITS RETAINED EARNINGS 
CHANNELED TOWARDS INVESTMENT) TO PAY OFF WHAT IT NOW OWES. 
VARIG IS IN HOCK NOT ONLY TO BOEING, GE (LEASEHOLDERS OF 
ITS AIRCRAFT), AND JAPANESE AND EUROPEAN BANKS, BUT TO ITS 
EMPLOYEE PENSION FUND AS WELL.  ALTHOUGH THE PENSION FUND 
BOOKS SHOW A NOMINAL VALUE OF 2.3 BILLION REAIS, ABOUT HALF 
OF THIS AMOUNT STILL HAS TO BE PAID IN BY THE COMPANY. 
VARIG FURTHER SUFFERS FROM HIGH FIXED COSTS AS A RESULT OF 
ITS BLOATED EMPLOYEE ROLLS.  ACCORDING TO ONE INDUSTRY 
CONTACT, THE COMPANY HAS 200 EMPLOYEES PER AIRCRAFT - WHILE 
ONE OF ITS CUT-RATE COMPETITORS FIELDS A RATIO OF 98 
EMPLOYEES PER AIRCRAFT. 
 
TOO BIG TO FAIL? 
---------------- 
 
7. (SBU) ONE ADVANTAGE THAT VARIG HAS (WHICH VASP DOES NOT) 
IS SIZE.  WHILE VASP HAS A WORK-FORCE OF 4,400 EMPLOYEES, 
VARIG EMPLOYS ALMOST 20,000 WORKERS, PROVIDES MORE THAN 
HALF OF THE JOBS IN THE DOMESTIC CIVAIR INDUSTRY, AND 
BRINGS MORE THAN USD 1 BILLION IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTO THE 
COUNTRY.  WITH THE COMPANY\'S EXTENDED REACH, IT HAS A 
READY-MADE CONGRESSIONAL BLOC INTERESTED IN ENSURING THE 
CARRIER\'S SURVIVAL.  INDEED, THE LOCAL PRESS REPORTS THAT 
ONE PROPOSAL CURRENTLY CIRCULATING IN CONGRESS (AND WHICH 
PURPORTEDLY HAS THE SUPPORT OF 272 SENATORS/DEPUTIES) WOULD 
SEEK TO RESTRUCTURE THE AIRLINE, WITH OUTSTANDING 
SUPPLIER/PENSION FUND DEBT BEING CONVERTED TO SHARES AND 
MONIES OWED TO THE GOB BEING RENEGOTIATED.  WHETHER THE GOB 
SHARES CONGRESS\' ENTHUSIASM FOR SEEKING TO BAIL OUT VARIG, 
HOWEVER, IS ANOTHER MATTER. 
 
8. (SBU) WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN A PLETHORA OF RUMORS OVER 
THE PAST FEW MONTHS THAT THE GOB IS CONSIDERING A RESCUE 
PACKAGE FOR VARIG, SO FAR THE LULA ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT 
PUT FORWARD ANY PROPOSAL.  THE DEPARTURE OF DEFENSE 
MINISTER VIEGAS IN EARLY NOVEMBER LIKELY SLOWED GOB 
DECISIONMAKING AS REGULATION OF CIVIL AVIATION FALLS UNDER 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.  STILL, ANOTHER LINE OF THINKING 
IS THAT THE GOB WILL WAIT UNTIL VASP GOES BUST PRIOR TO 
UNVEILING ANY PACKAGE SO IT THAT IT WON\'T BE CALLED ON TO 
BAIL OUT THAT CARRIER AS WELL.  BASED ON MISSION 
CONVERSATIONS WITH GOB OFFICIALS, IT IS CLEAR THAT, 
IDEALLY, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE VARIG TO SURVIVE (VASP 
ALREADY BEING SEEN AS A LOST CAUSE) BUT IS NOT QUITE SURE 
WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO MAKE THIS SO. 
 
THE OPTIONS 
----------- 
 
9. (SBU) IN POST\'S VIEW, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY UNFORESEEN 
NEGOTIATED OFFERS COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THERE ARE 
THREE BROAD COURSES OF ACTION THAT THE GOB CAN TAKE WITH 
RESPECT TO VARIG.  FIRST, IT COULD MOUNT A FULL-FLEDGED 
EFFORT TO SAVE THE AIRLINE AT ALL COSTS.  SUCH A PACKAGE 
COULD INCLUDE: A) CUT-RATE FINANCING FROM THE GOB\'S 
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (BNDES), B) PRESSURING LOCAL 
PENSION FUNDS TO INVEST IN THE AIRLINE, C) SEARCHING OUT 
POTENTIAL FOREIGN PARTNERS, D) SETTLING AN OUTSTANDING 
LAWSUIT BY VARIG SO AS TO INJECT FURTHER CASH INTO THE 
COMPANY, AND E) MANIPULATING THE CIVAIR REGULATORY REGIME 
TO BENEFIT VARIG. 
 
10. (SBU) COMPETITORS COMPLAIN THAT THE LOCAL CIVIL 
AVIATION AUTHORITY (DAC) HAS TO SOME EXTENT ALREADY ENGAGED 
IN THE LAST STEP AS IT HAS DELAYED APPLICATIONS BY 
COMPETITORS TO OBTAIN NEW LEASED AIRCRAFT WHILE EXPEDITING 
SIMILAR APPLICATIONS BY VARIG.  HOWEVER, TAKING MORE 
AMBITIOUS STEPS IN THIS REGARD (SUCH AS EXPLICITLY DIVIDING 
UP THE MARKET AND CHANNELING PROFITABLE ROUTES TO VARIG) 
WOULD RAISE BOTH LEGAL AND ANTI-TRUST CONCERNS.  IN 2003, 
CADE - ONE OF THE GOB\'S ANTI-TRUST ENFORCERS - INDICATED 
THAT IT WOULD TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT A PROPOSED TAM-VARIG 
MERGER.  AS TAM, WHICH HAS SEEN ITS REVENUES INCREASE AS 
THE MARKET EXPANDS, NOW APPEARS TO NO LONGER BE INTERESTED 
IN THE DEAL, THAT PROPOSED FUSION NOW LOOKS TO BE DEAD 
(ALTHOUGH ON CERTAIN ROUTES TAM-VARIG CODESHARES LIVE ON). 
 
11. (SBU) PERHAPS THE BEST ARGUMENTS AGAINST AN AGGRESSIVE 
BAIL-OUT WERE ENUNCIATED BY ONE PLANALTO INSIDER THE 
AMBASSADOR SPOKE TO.  WHY SHOULD A GOVERNMENT HEADED BY A 
WORKER\'S PARTY PRESIDENT SUBSIDIZE A POORLY-MANAGED FIRM 
WHICH SERVES THE ELITE (THE POOR DON\'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO 
FLY) WHEN IT DOES NOT SUBSIDIZE THE MODES OF TRANSPORT 
(BUS/METRO) MOST USED BY THE WORKING CLASS, HE ASKED 
RHETORICALLY?  ALL THIS AT A TIME WHEN THE GOB IS SQUEEZING 
EXPENDITURES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE TO PUT ITS 
FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER.  BESIDES, OUR CONTACT ADDED, VARIG\'S 
SITUATION WAS SO GRAVE THAT IT WAS LONG PAST THE TIME WHEN 
ANY FINANCIAL PACKAGE COULD BE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO KEEP 
THE COMPANY ALOFT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME. 
 
12. (SBU) ANOTHER OPTION AVAILABLE TO THE GOB IS TO SIMPLY 
SIT ON ITS HANDS, I.E., DECLINE TO ASSEMBLE A RESCUE EFFORT 
AND LET THE MARKET DETERMINE THE COMPANY\'S FATE.  UNDER 
THIS SCENARIO, TAM, GOL, AND BRA - ALL WELL-RUN AIRLINES - 
WOULD TAKE OVER VARIG\'S MARKET SHARE AND POSSIBLY EVEN HIRE 
A PORTION OF VARIG\'S WORKFORCE.  NEVERTHELESS, THIS COURSE 
WOULD EXPOSE THE GOB TO POLITICAL HEAT FROM BOTH THE 
CONGRESS AND THOSE WHO LOST THEIR JOBS, AND LIKELY IS NOT 
THE SOUND-BITE PRESIDENT LULA WOULD DESIRE FOR HIS 
REELECTION CAMPAIGN IN 2006. 
 
13. (SBU) ONE OFFICIAL FROM A COMPETITOR AIRLINE TOLD US 
THAT IF VARIG WERE TO GO BANKRUPT, THEN HE EXPECTED THAT 
THE DOMESTIC MARKET WOULD IMMEDIATELY SHAKE OUT WITH GOL 
AND TAM EACH ASSUMING A 40 PERCENT SHARE, AND BRA SERVING 
THE REMAINING 20 PERCENT.  OVERSEAS, HOWEVER, VARIG\'S QUICK 
DEATH WOULD MEAN THAT BRAZIL WOULD LOSE ITS MOST WELL-KNOWN 
INTERNATIONAL CARRIER.  WHILE TAM, GOL, AND BRA HAVE TAKEN 
INITIAL STEPS TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES ABROAD, NONE OF THEM 
CURRENTLY HAS THE INSTANT NAME RECOGNITION NEEDED TO 
ATTRACT LARGE NUMBERS OF FOREIGN PASSENGERS.  NOR, SHOULD 
VARIG ABRUPTLY CEASE OPERATIONS, WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO 
QUICKLY RAMP UP TO GET THE NECESSARY SLOTS INTO CROWDED 
AIRPORTS IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE.  FOREIGN CARRIERS, 
THEREFORE, WOULD LIKELY FILL THE VOID LEFT BY A QUICK VARIG 
EXIT - A RESULT WHICH THE GOB WOULD CERTAINLY SEEK TO 
AVOID. 
 
14. (SBU) THE THIRD PATH THE GOB MIGHT PURSUE IS TO OFFER 
UP A PARSIMONIOUS, HALF-HEARTED RESCUE PLAN - INCORPORATING 
ONE OR MORE OF THE ELEMENTS OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 9 ABOVE - 
-DESIGNED TO PROLONG THE PERIOD BEFORE WHICH VARIG DECLARES 
BANKRUPTCY.  THIS, ONE WELL-CONNECTED VARIG SUPPLIER TOLD 
US, WOULD MIMIC THE GOB\'S EARLIER RESPONSE TO THE EMERGENCE 
OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE NOW-DEFUNCT TRANSBRASIL 
AIRLINES AND IS THE TRADITIONAL BRAZILIAN WAY OF HANDLING 
SUCH MATTERS.  UNDER THIS SCENARIO, VARIG WOULD NOT CEASE 
OPERATIONS UNTIL AFTER THE FALL 2006 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
AND TAM, GOL, AND BRA WOULD, IN THE INTERIM, HAVE TIME TO 
READY THEMSELVES FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET.  WHILE THE 
FINANCIAL COST OF KEEPING VARIG ALIVE UNTIL FALL 2006 IS 
UNCLEAR, A LIMITED TWO-YEAR REPRIEVE WOULD CERTAINLY BE 
CHEAPER THAN A RESCUE EFFORT DESIGNED TO RETURN THE AIRLINE 
TO GOOD HEALTH.  GIVEN THE DRAWBACKS OF ALL THE OTHER 
COURSES OF ACTION AND THE LIMITED FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS 
THIS OPTION WOULD POSE FOR THE TREASURY, POST BELIEVES 
THAT, ABSENT THE SUDDEN EMERGENCE OF A PRIVATE SECTOR 
SUITOR, THIS IS THE PATH THAT THE GOB WILL EVENTUALLY 
ADOPT. 
 
15. (SBU) COMMENT.  THE DILEMMA THE GOB FACES IS A FAMILIAR 
ONE:  WHETHER TO RESCUE A KEY INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDER FROM 
THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS OWN BAD DECISIONS OR WHETHER TO 
INSTEAD LET THE MARKET DETERMINE THE COMPANY\'S FATE.  UP TO 
NOW, THE GOB HAS KEPT IS POWDER DRY, ALTHOUGH SOONER OR 
LATER IT WILL HAVE TO COME TO A DECISION.  AS THERE IS NO 
GOOD OPTION HERE FOR THE LULA ADMINISTRATION, IN THE END IT 
WILL SIMPLY HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH IS THE \"LEAST BAD\" 
ALTERNATIVE.

SUBJECT: TWO PARTIES BOLT FROM LULA\'S COALITION 
 
REF: A. BRASILIA 2802 
 
     B. BRASILIA 2763 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  In the past few days, two political 
parties --the large PMDB and medium-sized PPS-- have decided 
to depart the governing coalition of President Lula da Silva. 
 In both cases, the decisions were taken at hotly-disputed 
party meetings, and in both cases it appears that the parties 
may fracture over the decision.  These decisions are rooted 
in internal party catfights and the need to create daylight 
between the parties and Lula\'s PT party in order to run 
against the PT in the 2006 elections.  The effect on the 
administration\'s legislative agenda is difficult to gauge 
because pro-Lula members of both the PMDB and PPS are likely 
to change parties in the coming days in order to remain in 
the coalition or to continue to vote for administration bills 
in some cases.  The most likely outcome is that Lula will 
lose a few supporters in both houses of Congress but will 
continue to be able to put together narrow majorities on key 
issues with a combination of arm-twisting and pork barrel. 
The PMDB and PPS together hold three cabinet seats and have 
insisted that their cabinet representatives step down or be 
suspended from their party activities --but Lula is likely to 
wait for the dust to settle before he shakes up his cabinet. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
PMDB FINALLY MAKES A MOVE 
------------------------- 
2. (SBU) The Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement 
(PMDB), a large and fractious member of President Lula\'s 
governing coalition, decided at a party convention on 
December 12 to pull out of the coalition (ref A).  The 
decision followed weeks of intense lobbying inside and 
outside the party, including lawsuits to try to prevent the 
convention and attempts by both sides to stack the vote.  At 
bottom, the decision reflected the wish by \"oppositionist\" 
leaders --mostly in the large southern states (notably Rio, 
Sao Paulo, and Parana)-- to create more daylight between 
their party and President Lula\'s PT-led coalition.  This will 
allow them to run a PMDB presidential candidate against Lula 
in the 2006 elections and also to position their 
gubernatorial and congressional candidates against PT 
opponents.  The \"oppositionists\" are led by party president 
Michel Temer, a Federal Deputy from Sao Paulo.  Former-Rio 
Governor Anthony Garotinho hopes to be the party\'s 
presidential nominee in 2006. 
 
3. (SBU) The party\'s pro-Lula \"governist\" faction includes 
those delegations from states where the PMDB and PT work well 
together, plus most of the PMDB\'s sitting Senators and 
Federal Deputies (who benefit from being in the coalition by 
getting federal pork spending for their constituents).  The 
PMDB\'s two cabinet ministers (at the Ministries of 
Communications and Social Security) as well as powerful 
Senate President Jose Sarney are all \"governists\". 
 
4. (SBU) At the December 12 convention, the \"oppositionists\" 
won the vote to pull out of the coalition and passed a 
separate motion insisting that the party\'s political nominees 
(including notably the two cabinet ministers) step down from 
their posts or be suspended from party activities.  However, 
the convention split hairs by deciding to become 
\"independent\" of the administration without actually moving 
into the opposition.  This means that the party will continue 
to support Lula on the floor of Congress when \"it is in the 
party\'s interest\".  In fact, this may mean only a small 
change from the past, when Lula could rarely count on more 
than two-thirds of the party\'s votes on any given issue. 
Further, while the PMDB is a uniquely malleable institution 
in Brazilian politics, able to shelter both pro- and 
anti-government factions, some in the party will want to 
remain formally in the coalition and so will jump to other 
parties in the coming months. 
 
5. (SBU) Thus the math of the Congressional majority will be 
an evolving dynamic.  On paper, the governing coalition 
previously held 381 of the 513 Chamber seats (74%), of which 
78 were PMDB.  If half of the PMDB Deputies continue to vote 
with the administration, Lula can continue to cobble together 
narrow majorities, depending on the issue.  In the Senate, 
the picture looks more difficult.  The coalition held 47 of 
81 Senate seats (58%), of which 23 were PMDB.  But PMDB 
Senators tend to be more \"governist\" and supportive of the 
administration.  Again, depending on the issue, Lula should 
be able to find narrow majorities.  It must be borne in mind 
that the other coalition parties (including the PT) are also 
fractious and do not fully support the administration on 
every vote, which further erodes Lula\'s majority.  Also, some 
of the administration\'s legislative priorities require 
constitutional amendments, meaning 60% votes in both houses, 
and these bills will be in more danger than ordinary laws. 
 
PPS PARTY ALSO BOLTS 
-------------------- 
6. (SBU) The Popular Socialist Party (PPS) is the vestige of 
the old Communist Party and is still run with an iron hand by 
Roberto Freire, a bellicose Federal Deputy from Pernambuco 
who clings to radical leftist positions developed over thirty 
years ago.  In 2002, the party attracted Ciro Gomes to its 
banner.  Gomes, from Ceara, has a national profile and was 
looking for a party to launch what turned out to be a failed 
presidential bid.  In the wake of the elections, the PPS 
joined the governing coalition and Gomes accepted Lula\'s 
offer to become Minister of National Integration, where he 
has been a pleasant surprise as one of the administration\'s 
steadiest cabinet ministers.  Meanwhile, Freire chafed at 
having been eclipsed by Gomes within his own party and the 
coalition.  For over a year, he has instigated a series of 
bitter fights with Gomes and has repeatedly threatened to 
take the PPS out of the coalition.  On December 11, Freire 
forced a vote of the PPS governing board and finally made 
good on that threat.  Afterward he delivered a blunt message 
to Ciro Gomes, \"Either leave the cabinet or leave the party\". 
 
7. (SBU) Gomes may do both.  He has put his cabinet seat \"at 
Lula\'s disposal\", which is somewhat less assertive than 
actually resigning.  It seems likely that he will leave the 
PPS and move either to the coalition\'s centrist PTB or to 
Lula\'s PT.  Gomes\'s current close association with the 
administration means he is unlikely to run another 
presidential campaign against Lula in 2006.  If Gomes departs 
the PPS, he will take his faction with him --variously 
estimated at both of the PPS\'s Senators and one-third of its 
20 Federal Deputies.  Freire will remain in charge of the 
rump PPS and is feverishly looking for an alliance with the 
leftist PDT (or even the newly independent PMDB) and may be 
successful in luring PT Senator Cristovam Buarque to the 
party to run as its 2006 presidential candidate. 
 
LULA\'S CABINET SHUFFLE HANGING FIRE 
----------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) The impact on Lula\'s cabinet remains to be seen.  In 
the wake of the October municipal elections and last month\'s 
resignation by DefMin Jose Viegas and his replacement by Vice 
President Alencar (ref B), it was assumed that Lula would 
make a few cabinet changes in January or February.  Lula was 
reportedly willing to offer the PMDB a third cabinet post and 
may be looking to reward outgoing Chamber Speaker Joao Paulo 
Cunha with a promotion.  The splits in the PMDB and PPS have 
moved the cabinet shuffle to the back burner for the time 
being.  For example, Lula may want the two PMDB cabinet slots 
back so he can offer them to other allies, or he may leave 
those ministers in place as a way to continue to appeal to 
the PMDB\'s \"governist\" wing --which would also be a way to 
exacerbate the PMDB\'s internal rifts.  Similarly, Lula may 
leave Ciro Gomes in place because of his competence, in spite 
of his divorce from the PPS.  Thus the cabinet shuffle will 
wait until the administration can assess how best to salvage 
maximum political advantage from this week\'s events. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9. (SBU) It is too early to assess the damage to Lula\'s 
administration from the actions of the PMDB and PPS.  It is 
unlikely to be crippling, but will range from minimal to 
significant.  While the PMDB and PPS formally withdrew from 
the governing coalition, we cannot simply subtract their 
combined 98 Deputies and 25 Senators from Lula\'s column, 
because many of these congresspersons never reliably voted 
for Lula in the past, while many who did vote for Lula before 
will continue to do so in the future.  Thus, it is more 
accurate to say that the majority wings of these two parties 
formalized their opposition to the administration, leaving 
the minority wings to search for their own futures.  The 
story will continue to unfold through the holidays and into 
February, when Congress returns to session and elects new 
leadership in both houses and in all its committees.

SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES FTAA AND OTHER ISSUES WITH 
BRAZILIAN LEGISLATORS 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION, ON DECEMBER 9 AMBASSADOR 
MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE BRAZILIAN CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENSE COMMITTEE TO REVIEW OUTSTANDING 
ISSUES IN THE USG-GOB BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  ALTHOUGH THE 
MEETING AGENDA INCLUDED POTENTIAL TOPICS SPANNING A VARIETY 
OF DISCIPLINES, IN REALITY THE LION\'S SHARE OF THE 
DISCUSSION CENTERED ON FTAA ISSUES.  OUR CONGRESSIONAL 
INTERLOCUTORS STRESSED A NUMBER OF THEMES, INTER ALIA:  THE 
IMPORTANCE OF FREQUENT PARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGES BETWEEN U.S. 
AND BRAZILIAN LEGISLATORS, THE DESIRABILITY FOR THE GOB TO 
CONSULT WITH THE BRAZILIAN CONGRESS AS THE COUNTRY MOVES 
FORWARD ON THE FTAA AND OTHER TRADE INITIATIVES, AND THE 
NEED FOR U.S. POLICYMAKERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW BRAZIL\'S UNIQUE 
CULTURAL HERITAGE COMPLICATES GOB DECISION-MAKING ON TRADE 
MATTERS.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
2.  (U)  AS PART OF THE EMBASSY\'S CONTINUING OUTREACH 
EFFORTS, ON DECEMBER 9 AMBASSADOR VISITED THE CHAMBER OF 
DEPUTIES TO MEET (INFORMALLY) WITH MEMBERS OF THAT BODY\'S 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENSE COMMITTEE.  PRESENT AT THE 
MEETING WERE COMMITTEE CHAIR CARLOS MELLES (PFL), DEP. LUIZ 
CARLOS HAULY (PSDB), DEP. FERNANDO GABEIRA (SOCIALIST 
PARTY), DEP. LEONARDO MONTEIRO (PT), DEP. IVAN CESAR 
RANZOLIN (PP), DEP. ZARATTINI (PT), DEP. FEU ROSA (PP), 
FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. PAULO TARSO FLECHA DE LIMA 
(DESCRIBED BY MELLO AS A \"CONSULTANT\" TO THE COMMITTEE), AND 
MFA NORTH AMERICAN DESK OFFICER PAULO ALVARENGA. 
ACCOMPANYING THE AMBASSADOR FROM THE U.S. SIDE WERE EMBASSY 
POLCOUNS, ECONCOUNS, CONSUL, PRESS OFFICER, AND FO SPECIAL 
ASS\'T. 
 
3.  (U)  IN HIS OPENING REMARKS, COMMITTEE CHAIR MELLES 
NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE U.S.-BRAZIL BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP AND STRESSED THE NEED FOR CONTINUED 
PARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE 
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  MELLES NOTED THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS 
HAD RECENTLY TRAVELED TO THE U.S. PURSUANT TO A PAS- 
SPONSORED PROGRAM AND THAT THIS TRIP HAD PROVED TO BE 
EXTREMELY WORTHWHILE.  MELLES URGED THE EMBASSY TO PROMOTE 
FURTHER SUCH ENGAGEMENT, EITHER UNDER OAS AUSPICES OR 
PURSUANT TO AD HOC CODELS.  HE SUGGESTED BOTH SIDES SEEK TO 
CREATE A FORMAL EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE TWO CONGRESSES.  ON 
SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES, MELLES QUERIED THE AMBASSADOR ABOUT U.S. 
POLICY WITH RESPECT TO NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES BY ROGUE NATIONS 
SUCH AS NORTH KOREA AND IRAN, ADDING THAT BRAZIL WANTS PEACE 
AND THAT THE U.S. HAS A SOMEWHAT RIGID POINT OF VIEW. 
 
4. (U)  AMBASSADOR SAID THAT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION AND 
CONTROLS GO HAND IN HAND, AND THAT TOO MANY \"BAD GUYS\" HAVE 
WEAPONS.  REGARDING NORTH KOREA, THE USG BELIEVES THAT THE 
BEST APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS VIA THE 
SIX PARTY TALKS.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS IS NOT A 
UNILATERAL PROCESS, BUT RATHER A MULTILATERAL APPROACH.  HE 
CONTINUED SAYING THAT THE SITUATION WITH IRAN IS MORE 
COMPLICATED, AS IT IS LESS CLEAR, LESS KNOWN, AND MORE 
SUSPECT.  HE ADDED THAT THE U.S. HAS A DISARMAMENT PROGRAM, 
AND THAT WE COULD LEAD SUCH AN EFFORT, BUT THAT THIS CANNOT 
BE UNILATERAL.  HE SAID THAT BRAZIL HAS COMMUNICATED ITS 
RELUCTANCE TO HAVE THE ISSUE GO TO THE U.N., AND ASKED WHY 
HAS BRAZIL TAKEN SUCH A POSITION?  WOULDN\'T IT BE BETTER, HE 
ASKED, FOR MORE COUNTRIES TO KNOW AND ADDRESS THE SITUATION? 
 
5. (U)  AMBASSADOR THEN SPOKE REGARDING THE CURRENT STATE OF 
U.S.-BRAZIL RELATIONS, FOCUSING ON THE CHALLENGES THE 
PRESIDENT FACED IN HIS UPCOMING SECOND TERM.  ON THE TRADE 
FRONT, THE AMBASSADOR NOTED, THE U.S. AND BRAZIL WOULD NEED 
TO WORK TOGETHER IN BOTH THE WTO DOHA ROUND AND THE FTAA TO 
ENSURE THAT THESE EFFORTS PROVED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. 
AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT BRAZIL NEEDED TO AVOID THE MIND-SET 
THAT IT WAS THE USG THAT WAS NEGOTIATING THE FTAA, WHEN IN 
REALITY BOTH THE GOB AND THE U.S. WERE CO-CHAIRS AND NEARLY 
ALL THE COUNTRIES IN THE HEMISPHERE HAD A STRONG STAKE IN 
THE OUTCOME.  HE SAID THAT THE USG POSITION IS CLEAR: FREE 
TRADE WILL BRING ABOUT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MEANS OF 
BETTERMENT, BOTH FOR AMERICAN AND BRAZILIAN BUSINESSES AND 
CONSUMERS.  RESPONDING TO MELLE\'S COMMENT THAT BRAZILIANS 
ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE WHEN THE U.S. CRITICIZES BRAZIL, 
THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT WE RECOGNIZE BRAZIL\'S SENSITIVITY, 
BUT THAT WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE FRUSTRATION OF NOT 
DOING ENOUGH TO MOVE FORWARD THE NEGOTIATIONS. 
 
6. (U)  AFTER A BIT OF PROMPTING FROM COMMITTEE CHAIR 
MELLES, DEP. GABEIRA PROVIDED HIS INPUT ON BOTH TRADE AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTIONS.  SPECIFICALLY, GABEIRA NOTED THAT 
THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. COVERED MORE THAN 
JUST THE FTAA, ALTHOUGH TRADE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN GARNERED A 
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF COVERAGE BY THE PRESS.  WHAT WAS 
NEEDED, HE CONTINUED, WAS NEGOTIATION OF AN AGREEMENT THAT 
WOULD SERVE BOTH SIDES\' INTERESTS.  THE USG, HE STATED, 
NEEDED TO KEEP IN MIND AT ALL TIMES BRAZIL\'S UNIQUE 
CULTURAL/CATHOLIC HERITAGE AS IT DEALT WITH THE GOB.  (SEE 
PARA. 8 BELOW FOR MORE ON THIS POINT).  GABEIRA ALSO 
INQUIRED ABOUT THE USG\'S POSITION ON THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, 
INQUIRING AS TO WHETHER AN ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE PROPOSED. 
THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE OBJECTIONS

NOTED THAT WHILE BRAZIL WAS A HEMISPHERIC GIANT, ITS ECONOMY 
WAS NO RIVAL TO THAT OF THE U.S.  THE INHERENT ASSYMETRIC 
NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP, HE SAID, REQUIRED BRAZIL TO SEEK 
SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT ITS VULNERABLE INDUSTRIES.  THIS VIEW, 
HE CONTINUED, WAS AS MUCH THE CASE TODAY AS WHEN HE WAS IN

ABOUT THEIR VIEWS REGARDING THE PROPER ROLE OF CONGRESS IN 
THE FTAA NEGOTIATIONS.  IN ESSENCE, THEY MADE THE POINT THAT 
THE GOB NEEDS TO CONSULT THE RELEVANT CHAMBER/SENATE 
OFFICIALS EARLY AND OFTEN, AS WAS THE CASE IN UNITED STATES. 
FOREIGN TRADE RELATIONS, THEY FELT, WAS AN ISSUE TOO 
IMPORTANT TO BE LEFT TO DIPLOMATS AT ITAMARATY (I.E., THE 
FOREIGN MINISTRY).  ONLY INPUT FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS COULD 
ENSURE THAT THE TRADE POLICY THAT ITAMARATY ADOPTED TRULY 
REFLECTED BRAZILIAN NATIONAL INTERESTS AND WOULD BE 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  COMMITTEE CHAIR 
MELLO POINTED OUT THAT AT TIMES BRAZIL\'S CATHOLIC HERITAGE 
(SEE PARAGRAPH 6 ABOVE) LED POLICYMAKERS INTO THINKING THAT 
MAKING A PROFIT WAS A SIN.  THIS BIAS NEEDED TO BE

INTERLOCUTORS WERE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF EXPANDED U.S.- 
BRAZIL TRADE INTEGRATION, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE WE KNOW 
THAT SOME OF THEM HOLD CRITICAL VIEWS OF THE FTAA PROCESS. 
WHILE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE DEEPLY-INGRAINED 
ATTITUDES, OUR HOPE IS THAT INCREASED DIALOGUE - 
PARTICULARLY WITH U.S. PARLIAMENTARY COUNTERPARTS - WILL 
LEAD SOME TO REEXAMINE THEIR OPPOSITION.  EMBASSY WILL 
CONTINUE WITH ITS OUTREACH TO KEY LEGISLATORS NOT ONLY ON 
FTAA ISSUES BUT ON THE FULL RANGE OF OUR BILATERAL CONCERNS.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  After a two-year roller coaster ride, 
Brazilian President Lula da Silva has reached the halfway 
point of his term with his approval rating back up to 63%. 
His first year was marked by high approval numbers and 
unrealistic expectations, both by his administration and the 
public at large.  The second year opened with a dose of 
reality including economic pessimism, a scandal, and growing 
public impatience with the GoB\'s inability to deliver on its 
social agenda.  But as the economy has strengthened, Lula is 
regaining traction and early projections show him ahead of 
his likely challengers in the 2006 presidential race.  Lula\'s 
largest headache now is maintaining the governing coalition 
so that his administration can pass key bills and reforms 
through congress, and specifically to achieve greater results 
on the social agenda.  END SUMMARY. 
 
LULA\'S APPROVAL UP TO 63% 
------------------------- 
2. (SBU) According to a just-released November 29 IBOPE 
survey, President Lula\'s approval numbers continue to tick 
upward after bottoming out in midyear.  Lula\'s personal 
approval rating now stands at 63%.  (By contrast, Lula was 
elected with 61% of the votes in October 2002, his approval 
briefly topped 80% in early 2003, and then fell to a nadir of 
54% in June 2004.)  The approval ratings for Lula\'s 
government are also improving, though they have always run 
lower than his personal numbers.  The government approval 
rating now stands at 41%, up from 29% in June.  The 
improvement is seen as primarily linked to Brazil\'s 
strengthening economy.  To the extent that Lula\'s problems in 
early 2004 were caused by a series of black eyes --from the 
\"Waldomiro Scandal\" to a brutal fight in Congress over the 
minimum wage to the \"Red April\" of land occupations by the 
Landless Movement (MST)-- Lula has benefited both from the 
fact that the worst of the bad news seems to have run its 
course, and from the fact that the municipal elections in 
October kept Congress out of session for months, leaving him 
free to legislate by decree and keeping opposition party 
leaders too distracted to attack him in floor speeches. 
 
LULA LEADS PROJECTIONS FOR 2006 RACE 
------------------------------------ 
3. (SBU) The same IBOPE survey shows that Lula has a strong 
lead in early projections for the 2006 presidential race.  If 
the election were held today, Lula would beat newly-elected 
Sao Paulo mayor Jose Serra (PSDB) by 42-33%.  During this 
year\'s mayoral campaign, Serra pledged to complete his term 
through 2008, but his 33% showing in this poll is ten points 
better than he did in the first round of the 2002 
presidential race.  According to the IBOPE poll, Lula would 
easily beat the other two PSDB stars: Sao Paulo Governor 
Geraldo Alckmin (47-15%) and Minas Gerais Governor Aecio 
Neves (49-9%).  PMDB gadfly Anthony Garotinho polls between 
8% and 16% in the various projections --about how he fared in 
the 2002 race. 
 
ECONOMY MAY AFFORD HEALTHY MINIMUM WAGE HIKE 
-------------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Lula\'s popularity has recovered mostly on the 
strength of an improving economy, as GDP growth and 
employment have showed significant strength in recent months. 
 2004 GDP growth will likely be about 5% (ref B).  One way 
the president may be looking to consolidate both economic 
optimism and greater popularity is by deciding sooner rather 
than later on the size of the annual increase in the minimum 
wage.  Lula reportedly hopes this week to approve a hike from 
the current 260 to possibly as much as 300 reals per month. 
(Comment: While still a long way from Lula\'s unrealistic 
campaign promise to double the real minimum wage during his 
first term, the increase would be a significant 8% above 
inflation.)  Proposing a healthy increase before Congress 
comes back in mid-February could avert a repeat of last 
April\'s political blood-letting when the opposition and many 
in Lula\'s own Workers\' Party (PT) bitterly opposed his 
minimum wage adjustment proposal, which was only 1.2% above 
inflation (ref C).  Strong 2004 fiscal results make a bigger 
adjustment possible. 
 
PMDB AND PPS PULL OUT OF COALITION 
---------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) In the past three days, two parties have pulled out 
of Lula\'s coalition --the large PMDB and the medium-sized 
PPS-- to better position themselves in opposition to Lula\'s 
PT in advance of the 2006 elections (ref A).  Either or both 
of these parties may fracture in the coming weeks, meaning 
that it is too soon to assess how many Congressional votes 
Lula will lose by their defections.  But the early math 
suggests the administration should be able to cobble together 
narrow majorities on most, but perhaps not all, votes.  The 
two parties hold three cabinet posts (Communications, Social 
Security, and National Integration), and by January or 
February, Lula will have to decide whether to swap out those 
three ministers and whether that becomes part of a larger 
cabinet shuffle. 
 
CONGRESS TO PASS BUDGET AND GO INTO RECESS 
------------------------------------------ 
6. (SBU) Congress had a subpar year, failing to pass or make 
much progress on most key bills and reforms on its agenda. 
Congress spent the first half of the year in bitter partisan 
fights over how to handle the \"Waldomiro Scandal\" and the 
minimum wage.  In July, legislators returned to their states 
to stump for their parties\' candidates in the October 
municipal elections.  And after the elections, the PMDB 
--caught up in its internal disputes-- blocked committee and 
floor votes for weeks.  By year\'s end, the Joint Budget 
Committee will have passed its mandatory budget, while key 
sections of the Judicial Reform passed in early December. 
But left undone and on next year\'s agenda are:  labor 
reforms, final pieces of the 2003 tax and pension reforms, 
Public-Private Partnerships (to fund infrastructure 
projects), the Biosafety Law (to regulate biotechnology), and 
the Bankruptcy Law. 
 
COMMENT - \"THIS COUNTRY NEEDS DEVELOPMENT\" 
------------------------------------------ 
7. (SBU) Last week, Lula held the final full cabinet meeting 
of the year, a strategy session to close the book on the 
first half of his term and look forward to the next two 
years.  He set the tone in his opening remarks: \"After 
decades of stagnation, this country needs development\".  When 
Congress returns in February, it will choose new leadership 
in both the Senate and Chamber and in all the committees. 
These changes will be closely watched for clues to evolving 
dynamics in the administration and congress and to see if the 
new cabinet lineup and congressional leaders are able to 
improve the administration\'s efficiency and its congressional 
floor tactics, which ranged from fair to poor over the past 
two years.  Beyond the hike in the minimum wage, Lula is 
clearly animated to turn greater attention to the social 
agenda --everything from road and port improvements to 
strengthening the Zero Hunger program-- and economic growth 
may give him a bit more maneuvering room to do so.  He told 
the cabinet meeting that \"We have two years to go.  It\'s time 
to reap what we sowed (i.e., after two years of fiscal 
austerity).  Today, everything starts to change.\"

1. (U) To highlight the differences between the GOB and 
Parana Governor Requiao on investment issues, notably in 
the SANEPAR case (reftel A), Post is transmitting a 
December 11 article from the second largest circulation Sao 
Paulo Daily \"O Estado de Sao Paulo\", which reports on a 
recent public confrontation between Requiao and the 
Executive Secretary (Vice-Minister equivalent) of the GoB\'s 
Finance Ministry. 
 
2. (U) UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION 
 
HEADLINE: FOR REQUIAO, RESPECTING CONTRACTS IS NONSENSE 
 
SIDEBAR:  The Governor presses the Executive Secretary of 
Finance in public, terming a speech by the latter in 
defense of respecting contracts between the public and 
private sectors as \"ladainha\" (i.e., rambling talk, 
tiresome recital, rigamarole). 
 
ARTICLE TEXT:  The Governor of Parana, Roberto Requiao 
(PMDB), yesterday embarrassed the Executive Secretary of 
the Finance Ministry, Bernard Appy, when he criticized 
[GOB] economic policy and labeled Appy\'s speech 
\"rigamarole.\" 
 
\"The stability of these contracts is nonsense,\" affirmed 
Requiao. 
 
At the opening of the ordinary meeting of the National 
Council of Tax Policy (Confaz) in Foz de Iguacu, Appy had 
highlighted the good performance of the economy and the 
consolidation of a more stable institutional framework for 
private investment.  Right afterwards, he was confronted 
directly face to face by Requiao in front of the Finance 
Secretaries. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
\"I was surprised by the Executive Secretary\'s remarks.  The 
impression I have is that Parana isn\'t part of the country 
described by Mr. Appy\", he stated.  \"Growth in Brazil is 
anything but sustainable.  We are following the old neo- 
liberal model\".  At this point, Requiao compared Appy\'s 
speech in favor of the stability of contracts to the theory 
developed by ex-president Fernando Henrique Cardoso during 
the 60\'s, on the role of international capital in the 
development of Latin America.  \"This is where we get the 
rambling talk of security for investors with respect to 
contracts,\" said Requiao, calling FHC\'s (Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso) most famous academic text, written in partnership 
with Enzo Faletto - \"Dependency and Development in Latin 
America\" - an insignificant \"little book\". 
 
He also complained about the editorials in \"O Estado de Sao 
Paulo\" regarding his decisions to question and break 
contracts signed by predecessors.  \"Here in Parana, 
contracts that consecrate theft are questioned.  If there 
is a contract that should be respected, it is the contract 
with the people.\" 
 
Clearly bothered, Appy sought to respond, but Requiao 
rapidly interrupted, preventing him from doing so.  \"If you 
reply, I\'ll just rebut what you say.\"  End Unofficial 
Translation. 
 
3. (SBU) Comment. Requiao\'s reported comments at the Confaz 
meeting are consistent with other public and private 
comments he has made regarding foreign investment and 
respect for contracts since taking office in January 2003. 
Requiao told Sao Paulo Consul General Duddy in April 2003 
that it was his responsibility as Governor to suspend 
contracts that were \"clearly not in the interest of the 
State or its consumers.\"  He cited in particular the 
suspension of payment by Copel, the Parana parastatal 
energy company, to privately owned generating plants as an 
example of a \"corrupt\" contract subject to suspension.  In 
other conversations with mission officials and in public 
statements, Requiao has also made it clear that he opposes 
in principle the privatization of most essential public 
services, such as energy, sanitation, and roadways (reftels 
B and C).  Requiao\'s public criticism of Executive 
Secretary Appy\'s remarks is also consistent with his style; 
 
SIPDIS 
our interlocutors across the political spectrum in Parana 
universally describe him as intentionally polemical and 
thriving on controversy. End Comment.

SUBJECT: LULA MAY END UP WINNER IN PMDB PARTY CRISIS 
 
REF: BRASILIA 3031 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  The large PMDB party decided at a December 
12 convention to defect from the governing coalition of 
Brazilian President Lula da Silva.  The decision exacerbated 
the rift between the party\'s pro- and anti-government wings, 
but as the dust settles it appears that Lula could benefit 
from the crisis.  Lula plans to keep the two PMDB members in 
his cabinet and will continue to collaborate with the 
pro-government PMDB members of Congress.  This posture has 
helped to solidify the party\'s pro-government wing, and Lula 
can now reasonably count on most of the PMDB votes in both 
houses.  The crisis may not play out until February, but with 
the administration and savvy PMDB Senator Jose Sarney working 
against the withdrawal from the coalition (and the 
anti-government wing making tactical blunders), Lula may well 
turn the crisis in his favor.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) The Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement 
(PMDB) is being derided as the \"Party of the Brazilian 
Disorganized Mix-ups\".  The anti-government wing forced a 
vote at a December 12 party convention to pull out of Lula\'s 
coalition (reftel).  By this, party leaders hoped to 
establish themselves as \"independent\" of Lula\'s Workers\' 
Party (PT) so that they can run against Lula and the PT\'s 
other candidates in the 2006 elections.  However, those party 
leaders are now on the defensive as the pro-government wing 
has united in a counter-attack supported by the 
administration. 
 
PMDB CAUCUS IN CONGRESS SWINGS TOWARD LULA 
------------------------------------------ 
3. (SBU) In Congress, leading PMDB Senators Jose Sarney and 
Renan Calheiros have finally buried the hatchet on their 
dispute over who will be the next Senate President (it will 
likely be Calheiros).  Their reconciliation brought together 
the PMDB caucus in the Senate so that 20 of the party\'s 23 
Senators are now counted as pro-government.  Sarney\'s 
support, in particular, is key.  His political instincts are 
unrivalled, and he is a devoted government ally who can pull 
innumerable strings on Lula\'s behalf (but on the few 
occasions that he has been irritated with the administration, 
he has caused it to lose key floor votes).  In the lower 
house, the picture is similar.  The party\'s pro-government 
faction in the Chamber showed its teeth December 15 in 
collecting 47 votes (of the party\'s 78 Deputies) to retain 
pro-government Deputy Jose Borba as party whip.  Thus the 
pro-Lula faction owns a solid majority of the party caucus in 
both houses. 
 
TEMER\'S FAILED MOVE TO EXPEL DISSIDENTS 
--------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU)  As a key coalition member, the PMDB nominated two 
cabinet ministers and several other senior administration 
officials.  In the wake of the party\'s withdrawal from the 
coalition, PMDB president Michel Temer, who leads the party\'s 
anti-government bloc, ordered these officials to quit their 
posts.  They refused, and Temer moved to expel them from the 
party.  Those threatened with expulsion are:  Communications 
Minister Eunicio Oliveira, Social Security Minister Amir 
Lando, Director of the Social Security Agency (INSS) Carlos 
Bezerra, Director of Petrobras\'s transportation unit 
(Transpetro) Sergio Machado, and Director of the Postal 
System (Correios) Joao Henrique de Almeida.  But the battle 
is also being waged in the courts, and Temer\'s move was 
short-circuited by a judge\'s decision that declared the 
entire PMDB convention void.  Thus, the party members who 
hold posts in Lula\'s administration will defy Temer and keep 
their jobs.  As a tactical matter, Temer\'s move to expel the 
five was a failed show of strength that backfired and may 
cost him dearly as events unfold. 
 
LULA CAPITALIZING ON THE SITUATION 
---------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) The day after the December 12 party convention, Lula 
met with the PMDB\'s pro-government leaders and reportedly 
offered them behind-the-scenes support to replace Temer with 
Sarney as party president in mid-2005.  In the meantime, Lula 
will seek to exploit the party\'s divisions by working 
exclusively with the pro-government faction, offering support 
and pork spending to its congressional bloc, and keeping the 
two PMDB cabinet ministers in place.  Lula pointedly said 
this week that he plans no cabinet shuffle until January at 
the earliest. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (SBU)  Senator Jose Sarney and the pro-government wing of 
the PMDB are counter-attacking, and Sarney is a formidable 
tactician who has already managed to forge a weighty support 
bloc in Congress.  Party President Michel Temer and the 
anti-government wing have the support of the large party 
delegations from Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and a handful of 
other key states that have never been comfortable in Lula\'s 
camp.  Both sides will continue to maneuver, but in the 
short-term, Lula will to treat the pro-government wing as a 
coalition member (and will retain his PMDB cabinet 
ministers).  Congress will go out of session by December 30, 
so the crisis may not play out until February or March. 
Senator Jorge Bornhausen (president of the opposition PFL 
party) notes with dismay that the crisis has had the effect 
of clearly defining the  PMDB\'s internal rift and making its 
pro-government wing more committed to Lula.  Thus, he 
predicts, the work of the opposition may become more 
difficult in the coming year because it will be harder to 
pick off disaffected PMDB members during votes.  On the other 
hand, Rio Mayor Cesar Maia, also of the PFL, commented in the 
press that \"the PMDB is a rare case of a party that gets 
stronger with disunity.  As the sides become defined, the 
government and opposition wings get stronger through 
bargaining.  When it is united, the party is weaker.\"

ANNOUNCED IN JUNE THAT THE INVESTIGATION REGARDING BRAZIL\'S 
ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT LAW WOULD BE EXTENDED FOR 90 DAYS, 
AND THAT JUST RECENTLY THIS REVIEW HAD BEEN EXTENDED ONCE 
MORE FOR AN ADDITIONAL 180 DAYS.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT 
THE USG HAS RECENTLY HELD MEETINGS WITH THE GOB AND 
RECOGNIZES THE MEASURES ALREADY TAKEN BY THE GOB TO ADDRESS 
PIRACY.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THERE IS, HOWEVER, STRONG 
PRESSURE ON WASHINGTON TO WITHDRAW BRAZIL\'S GSP BENEFITS, 
IN LIGHT OF THE $700 MILLION IN ESTIMATED LOSSES DUE TO 
COPYRIGHT PIRACY.  HE ASKED THAT THE GOB DEMONSTRATE 
PARTICULARLY AGGRESSIVE ENGAGEMENT, I.E. SELF-INITIATED 
RAIDS, SEIZURES AND INSPECTIONS, AND NOT JUST IN RIO AND 
SAO PAULO, BUT ALSO OTHER AREAS SUCH AS FOZ DO IGUACU AND

IMPORTANCE OF EXPEDITIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS 
RESULTING FROM THE RAIDS AND SEIZURES. 
 
2. (SBU) PATRIOTA, WHO WAS LEAVING ON TRAVEL THE FOLLOWING

CONSULTATIVE MECHANISM TO REVIEW PROGRESS (PRIOR TO MARCH) 
WAS ACCEPTABLE. 
 
--  THE MFA, AS HAD PRIVATE INDUSTRY, HAD ALREADY FORWARDED 
TO THE NATIONAL ANTI-PIRACY COUNCIL A DRAFT NATIONAL ACTION 
PLAN.  THE COUNCIL WOULD MEET EARLY IN THE NEW YEAR TO 
CONSIDER THESE DOCUMENTS. 
 
--  THE PACE OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AT KEY POINTS SUCH AS 
THE FRIENDSHIP BRIDGE HAD ALREADY INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. 
NOTWITHSTANDING THE LIMITATIONS OF THEIR DATA COLLECTION, 
THE MFA HOPED TO SOON FIND OUT TO WHAT DEGREE THIS 
INCREASED ENFORCEMENT HAD RESULTED IN PROSECUTIONS. 
 
--  WHILE THE GOB COULD ISSUE RECOMMENDATIONS TO STATE AND 
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS, GIVEN THE INDEPENDENT BENT OF THE 
FEDERAL/STATE PUBLIC MINISTRIES THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE THAT 
THE PROSECUTORS WOULD PAY ANY HEED TO SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS. 
AND WHILE THE GOB PLANS TO LAUNCH A NATIONAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN

Ref: State 245841 
 
PATTERNS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM 
 
1.  (U) Triborder Area (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) 
 
(Please review with submissions from other TBA posts.) 
The Triborder area (TBA) -- where Argentina, Brazil, and 
Paraguay converge -- has been characterized as a regional hub for 
Hizballah and HAMAS fundraising activities.  However, the region 
more widely known as a center for arms and drug trafficking, 
contraband smuggling, document and currency fraud, money 
laundering, and the manufacture and movement of pirated goods. 
Although there continued to be reports during 2004 of an al-Qaida 
presence in the TBA, these reports remained uncorroborated by 
intelligence and law-enforcement officials. 
 
2.  (U) In December 2004, senior level U.S. officials attended a 
meeting in Asuncion, Paraguay, of the Tripartite Commission 
of the Triple Frontier, a security mechanism established by 
the three TBA countries in 1998. The \"Three Plus One\" 
group (the three TBA countries plus the United States) 
serves as a continuing forum for fostering cooperation and 
terrorism prevention among the four countries. Participants 
concluded that available information did not substantiate 
allegations of operational activities by terrorist groups in the 
TBA at the present time. International terrorist financing and 
money laundering with roots in the TBA remain an area of 
heightened concern. The parties agreed to conduct a concerted 
effort to foster legitimate economic activity in the TBA. 
 
3.  (U) Brazil continues to extend practical and effective 
support for US counter-terrorism efforts.  For example, the 
Government of Brazil diligently pursues investigative leads 
provided by US intelligence, law enforcement, and financial 
agencies regarding terrorist suspects. 
 
4.  (U) Although the Government of Brazil is committed to the 
fight against terrorism, lack of resources and inadequately 
trained personnel hampers its response.  The United States 
continues to work with Brazil in several bilateral, multilateral, 
and international forums to identify groups and individuals 
suspected of possible links to terrorist groups.  Specialists 
from 
the United States work with elements of the Brazilian Government 
responsible for combating terrorism, including the Federal Police 
and the Brazilian Intelligence Service.  Brazil is increasingly 
capable of monitoring domestic financial operations and 
effectively utilizes its Financial Activities Oversight Council 
(COAF) to identify possible funding sources for terrorist groups. 
Recent bilateral assistance and training provided by the USG to 
COAF emphasized upgrades to its database and data collection 
mechanism.  In January 2005, the Brazilian Federal Police will 
inaugurate a Regional Field Office in Foz do Iguacu, Parana, to 
coordinate its intelligence and enforcement efforts in the TBA. 
 
5.  (U) Since taking office in January 2003, Brazilian President 
Ignacio Lula da Silva has vigorously condemned terrorism.  The 
Lula administration, however, does not acknowledge the presence 
of 
terrorist groups on Brazilian soil and insists that no 
identifiable terrorist incidents have occurred in the country. 
In 
2003, the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies passed a bill on cyber- 
crime aimed at preventing terrorist hack attacks, however the 
bill 
continues to languish in the Brazilian Senate. 
 
6.  (U) There are no significant impediments to the prosecution 
or 
extradition of suspected terrorists by Brazil, although Brazil\'s 
legal procedures are often tedious and protracted. Brazilian law 
prohibits the extradition of Brazilian citizens and allows only 
very measured and careful consideration for the extradition of 
naturalized citizens (for previous crimes and drug trafficking 
only) and foreigners (for all but ideological or political 
crimes). 
 
7.  (U) After extensive legal maneuverings, Brazil extradited 
Assad Ahmad Barakat to Paraguay in November 2003.  Throughout the 
case, Brazilian extradition procedures were followed rigorously. 
Barakat, a naturalized Paraguayan of Lebanese origin who had 
lived 
in the TBA for approximately seven years, was suspected of 
involvement in political and financial activities supporting 
Hizballah organizations.  He was arrested on a Paraguayan 
extradition request in June 2002 by Brazilian authorities.  In 
2004, Barakat was convicted in Paraguay of tax evasion and 
sentenced to 6 years of prison.  However, given his time served 
in 
Brazil and anticipated early release for good behavior, Barakat 
could be free within two years.  He is currently appealing this 
sentence. 
 
8.  (U) In May 2004, the Government of Brazil at the 
initiative of the Chief of the Presidency\'s Institutional 
Security Office created a technical team composed of 
representatives from five key ministries and the three branches 
of 
the Armed Forces to formulate a national policy to combat 
terrorism.  The group delivered to the President its 
recommendations which will serve as the basis for a bill the Lula 
administration intends to submit to the Brazilian Congress.  This 
bill will call for the establishment of a national authority for 
combating terrorism. 
 
9. (U) In November 2004, at the Sixth Conference of Defense 
Ministers of the Americas, Brazil declined to support the 
U.S. proposal to reorganize and restructure the Inter-American 
Defense Board as a tool for coordinating regional counter-crime 
and counter-terrorism efforts. Brazil is reluctant to tamper with 
the mandate of the IADB. 
 
10. (U) In November 2004, President Lula and Russian Federation 
President Vladimir V. Putin issued a joint declaration calling 
for 
compliance with United Nations Resolutions 1540 and 1566.  These 
resolutions deal with the prevention of access to weapons of mass 
destruction by non-state agents and with the threats to 
international peace and security raised by terrorism. 
President Lula also declared himself in favor of entering 
negotiations on a Universal Convention on International 
Terrorism and the International Convention to Fight Acts of 
Nuclear Terrorism, all within the framework of the United 
Nations.  Brazil has signed all of the twelve current UN 
conventions on terrorism and is a party to nine.

1.  (C)  SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  At a November 22 dinner 
for visiting Deputy National Security Advisor Faryar Shirzad 
and NSC Director Del Renigar,  senior executives of key 
Brazilian and multinational companies questioned Brazil\'s 
continued membership in Mercosur (in its current 
configuration as a customs union), noting that Argentina, in 
particular, is preventing Mercosur from entering into 
meaningful trade agreements.  The next day Shirzad and 
Renigar traveled to Brazilia for a series of meetings with 
senior GOB economic policymakers.  Among the delegation\'s 
interlocutors were Finance Minister Antonio Palocci, Central 
Bank Governor Henrique Meirelles, Presidential Foreign Policy 
Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia, and Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretaries Clodoaldo Hugueney (WTO and Bilateral Trade) and 
 
SIPDIS 
Luiz Filipe de Macedo Soares (South America and FTAA).  The 
wide-ranging discussions with the GOB touched upon a variety 
of issues, including prospects for the Doha Round, views of 
Brazilian business towards trade talks, regional economic 
integration, the future of Mercosur, the state of play on 
FTAA, and macro-economic, monetary, and tax policy.  The 
highlights:  U/S Hugueney had specific thoughts about how to 
best proceed on the Doha Round; Presidential Advisor Garcia 
disclosed that the GOB did not plan to renew its IMF Standby 
program upon when it expired in March 2005; Finance Minister 
Palocci expressed concern about the need for an adjustment in 
the USG\'s current account; and Central Bank Governor 
Meirelles made it very clear that he and FinMin Palocci were 
the ones dictating GOB orthodox macro-economic policies (and 
that these policies would continue). END SUMMARY AND 
INTRODUCTION. 
 
 
WTO Doha Agenda 
--------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Ambassador Clodoaldo Hugueney, Under Secretary for 
Economics and Technological Affairs, provided a comprehensive 
review of GoB interests and expectations for progress in the 
WTO Doha Development Agenda trade talks.  Hugueney was 
explicit that the Doha Round is the GoB,s top trade 
priority.  He said the GoB prefers multilateral negotiations 
because they will provide greater commercial gains than 
bilateral or regional accords due to Brazil,s diversified 
trade structure (in terms of products and export markets). 
Hugueney noted that a recent World Bank study had reached a 
similar conclusion, and registered concern that the growing 
number of bilateral and regional negotiations could divert 
attention from the Doha Round.  Hugueney pointed out that 
certain issues, such as agricultural subsidies, which are 
central to agricultural liberalization -- a key GoB interest, 
can only be solved at the WTO level.  As a further benefit of 
the multilateral talks, he noted the more abundant 
opportunities for various trade-offs, which can help to 
facilitate negotiations from the domestic side.  (Note. 
Hugueney added that he believed fewer trade-off possibilities 
was largely to blame for the failure to conclude FTAA and 
Mercosur-EU negotiations.) 
 
Doha Timing 
----------- 
 
3.  (C)  According to GoB thinking, the Doha Round needs to 
be completed by the end of 2006 -- before the mid-2007 
expiration of an extended Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). 
Should the negotiations drag into 2007, Hugueney contemplated 
two scenarios, both undesirable from a GoB perspective.  In 
one scenario, negotiators facing a mid-2007 cut-off would 
adopt a quick-fix, reducing the scope of the agreement. 
Alternatively, he foresaw the possibility of protracted 
negotiations, extending way beyond 2007 due to a hiatus 
awaiting passage of new TPA legislation.  Hugueney downplayed 
any possible affect from Brazilian presidential elections in 
2006 on a Doha timeframe, claiming a broad domestic consensus 
exists in favor of the negotiations and Itamaraty,s handling 
of them. 
4.  (C)  Hugueney argued that the following elements need to 
be in place by the December 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial to 
make possible a 2006 end-date: agreement must be reached on 
modalities for agriculture negotiations; there must be a 
refinement of the scope for industrial products; revised 
offers for services must be made; as well as progress on 
development issues, including cotton, implementation, and 
special and differential treatment.  While noting that 
\"accidents,\" such as TPA initial expiration, changeover of EU 
Commissioners, and CAP reform, could complicate the 
discussions, he believed these objectives are feasible by the 
Hong Kong meeting.  While not mentioning Brazil,s own 
candidate for the WTO DG job, Hugueney said he hoped the 
selection process would be less contentious than last time 
lest it slow down the negotiations.  Certain institutional 
issues, such as inadequate secretariat funding and 
ineffective organization for support of the negotiations, 
also need to be addressed, but he believed could be handled 
in discussions parallel to the substantive negotiations. 
 
Progress by Hong Kong 
--------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  The agriculture modality talks will hinge on market 
access, according to Hugueney, who described market access 
barriers as the last line of defense for many developing 
countries, which do not have the resources to utilize export 
and domestic support.  He argued against a legalistic 
approach toward defining criteria for graduation of 
developing countries, which he claimed would mire the 
negotiations.  Instead Hugueney pressed for a more common 
sense approach saying its obvious that the same rules cannot 
apply to vastly different types of countries, such as 
Switzerland and India.  When asked by D/NSA Shirzad to 
elaborate, Hugueney cited the extent of a country,s rural 
poverty and subsistence farming as examples of factors that 
should be considered.  However, he claimed Brazil would be 
willing to take on different market access commitments from 
other developing countries because of its overall 
competitiveness in agriculture, despite the fact that it also 
still has severe problems with rural poverty. 
 
6.  (C)  Hugueney said Brazil will continue to play a key 
role in keeping the G-20 constructively engaged in the 
process, but cautioned that a refusal by others to make 
accommodations in market access rules for members which are 
more defensive on agriculture would likely push them more in 
line with the protectionist G-10, making an agreement much 
more difficult to reach.  Although diverse tariff structures 
and differences in offensive and defensive interests present 
challenges for the G-20, Hugueney said the group will 
continue to formulate proposals.  He added that the G-20 is 
committed to achieving agriculture modalities by Hong Kong. 
(The next G-20 Ministerial is slated for February in New 
Delhi.) 
 
How to Move Forward 
------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Hugueney opined that the Five Interested Parties 
(FIP) group worked well when convened at minister level, but 
was frustrating at the high-official level.  He said the GoB 
recognizes that some type of small group process is essential 
for making deals, but did not think it useful to reconvene 
the FIPs until perhaps March or April next year.  In the 
intervening months, Hugueney suggested ramped-up 
consultations, perhaps even a mini-ministerial, to assuage 
the concern of some countries over exclusion from the FIP 
process and to better identify issues.  An FIP meeting in 
March/April could then kick off a more intensive phase of 
negotiations to produce results before the last sessions of 
the Agriculture Committee and General Council in July.  At 
that point, it should be possible to articulate what would be 
the preferred/possible outcome in Hong Kong -- if not full 
modalities for agriculture, perhaps a partial package.  In 
the run up to Hong Kong, attention would have to be paid to 
both specific issues and to the emerging package as a whole. 
 
 
Receptiveness of Brazilian Industry to Trade Talks 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8.  (C)  D/NSA Shirzad queried Hugueney regarding the 
attitudes of Brazilian industry towards multilateral trade 
talks and whether the GOB periodically consulted with the 
country\'s private sector.  Hugueney replied he regularly 
conducted such consultations, and that one could detect three 
general clusters of industry views.  First, there was a bloc 
of modern firms, whose managers strongly favored trade 
liberalization as their competes were well positioned to take 
advantage of increased opportunities in foreign markets.  A 
second cluster of companies, still most dependent on domestic 
sales, was less enthusiastic about trade talks, though with 
support and a new generation of investment would be able to 
compete should highly-efficient foreign firms enter the 
market.  Problems arose, however, with regard to the third 
cluster of firms, which if further market opening took place 
would not be competitive no matter how much time they had to 
prepare.  Fortunately, he said, this third cluster -- which 
vehemently opposed the FTAA -- has not been vocal in 
opposition to the WTO Doha Round. 
 
FTAA 
---- 
 
9.  (C)  Ambassador Luiz Filipe de Macedo Soares, Under 
Secretary for South America, provided a less detailed and 
 
SIPDIS 
less enthusiastic discourse on FTAA negotiations to Shirzad, 
Renigar and emboffs.  First, Macedo Soares emphasized the 
importance of South America in President Lula,s foreign 
policy, noting institutional changes within the Foreign 
Ministry that reflect its commitment to follow through on 
this long-standing Brazilian interest.  On the negotiations 
themselves, he recapped the main FTAA events leading up to 
last year,s Miami Ministerial, as well as the subsequent 
Trade Negotiating Committee meeting in February of this year 
and smaller group discussions, which failed to reach 
agreement on implementation of the Miami compromise.  Macedo 
Soares insisted that Mercosul,s proposal last year to change 
the FTAA reflected an interest in finding a way forward for 
the negotiations given the paralysis that existed within the 
negotiating groups, a paralysis resulting not from Brazilian 
interests, but from differing positions between all the FTAA 
countries. 
 
10.  (C)  Although the FTAA negotiations are currently 
\"dormant,\" Macedo Soares opined that all parties want to go 
on with the negotiations once establishment of the framework 
is complete.  On timing, he said he \"supposed\" the 
negotiations will be complete next year, after first saying 
the GoB was \"open to,\" he then changed to \"would like to\" 
host a ministerial in the first semester of next year.  When 
asked by D/NSA Shirzad about implications should the FTAA 
remain stalled, Macedo Soares noted that the U.S. has active 
bilateral negotiations within the region and that it is in 
the interests of all that there be an agreement covering 
Mercosul as well.  He claimed there should be no doubt 
Mercosur favors free-trade and said characterization of 
Mercosul as \"systemically less ambitious\" is unfair, even if 
there are instances when economic interests and asymmetries 
warrant less ambition. 
 
Mercosur-EU 
---------------- 
 
11.  (C)  According to Macedo Soares, the GoB has lost no 
enthusiasm for reaching a trade deal with the EU, and has 
interpreted agreement by the new EU Commission to hold a 
meeting shortly after its investiture as signaling a similar 
level of commitment from that bloc.  (Note: The December 2 
meeting in Rio is reportedly only to allow technical staff to 
set up a work plan; a Ministerial is planned for next March. 
End note.)   Macedo Soares confirmed GoB aspirations for 
Mercosur to transform into a EU-type common market.  He noted 
Brazilian interests in strengthening the political dimension 
of the bloc, including development of a Mercosur Parliament, 
and the on-going work to update the 1994 Ouro Preto protocol 
to reflect institutional changes over the last ten years.  He 
downplayed the bloc,s internal difficulties assuring us that 
the EU has had its share of problems without facing collapse, 
and rejected recent calls from some quarters for Brazil to 
negotiate trade agreements independent from its Mercosur 
partners, claiming it is precisely negotiation as a bloc that 
prompted EU interest in a trade deal.  (Note.  Roberto 
Gianetti da Fonseca, new head of the Sao Paulo Federation of 
Industries, Foreign Trade Department, recently proposed that 
Mercosul devolve into a free-trade area allowing its members 
to negotiate separate trade agreements.) 
 
State of Play in South America 
------------------------------ 
 
12.  (C)  \"Very bad\" was Macedo Soares, stark assessment of 
the state of affairs in South America.  This is one reason, 
he noted, for the current push toward regional integration -- 
to establish a \"system\" of countries that can act as a 
support structure and to foster greater cooperation.  (Note. 
Unclear if he was referring to the South American Community 
of Nations initiative to be signed in Cuzco, Peru on December 
9. End note.)  He pointed out the substantial physical 
barriers to movement between the countries of South America 
and identified transportation infrastructure projects as a 
priority for the region.  He also noted that politically, 
countries of the region are becoming much more open to 
cooperation, placing aside issues of sovereignty in accepting 
assistance from neighboring countries.  A case in point was 
the solicitation by a number of countries (Costa Rica, 
Nicaragua, Ecuador) for Brazilian support during the recent 
Rio Group meeting.  The GoB is also trying to strengthen 
President Mesa of Bolivia by providing deliverables, such as 
forgiveness of the Bolivian debt, but Macedo Soares described 
his situation as precarious. 
 
Central Bank Governor Meirelles and FinMin Palocci 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
13.  (SBU)  D/NSA Shirzad also met (separately) with Central 
Bank Governor Henrique Meirelles and Finance Minister Antonio 
Palocci.  Meirelles stated that Brazil is living its best 
economic moment in his lifetime.  GDP growth rates over the 
last three quarters had exceeded six percent, he said, and 
the economy was continuing to grow strongly, albeit at a 
decreasing rate.  While in the past Brazil had experienced 
brief episodes of growth (average growth over the last 
decade, for example, was only 1.8%), the current expansion, 
he argued, was on a much more sustainable footing than past 
recoveries, primarily because of the strongly positive 
external accounts.  The trade surplus, he declared, driven by 
booming and well-diversified exports, had led to a strong 
current account surplus.  Debt levels were falling, as were 
risk indicators such as exports as a percentage of GDP.  The 
trade surplus was feeding the foreign exchange market at the 
rate of $150 million/day, he observed, and the dollar was 
weakening against the real.  The recovery was also capital 
goods and consumer-durables led, which suggested increasing 
investment. 
 
14.  (SBU)  According to Meirelles, despite the current 
elevated growth numbers, potential GDP growth was only about 
3.0 to 3.5%. When inflation began to re-emerge, he continued, 
the Central Bank tightened monetary policy to try to bring 
growth towards that level.  Meirelles felt that an 
inflationary bias in the economy still remained from the 
period of hyperinflation, when industrialists played the game 
of adjusting their prices faster than wages could adjust.  He 
called such price increases short-sighted, as the erosion in 
workers\' purchasing power had contributed to subsequent 
recessions.  It would take continued growth in investment 
levels to expand the economy\'s potential growth capacity, he 
concluded. 
 
15.  (SBU)  Meirelles felt that the GOB\'s microeconomic 
agenda (i.e, bankruptcy reform, judicial reform, creation of 
a mortgage market) would begin to improve the business 
environment.   Central Bank independence would help, he 
added, although he was uncertain the proposed legislation to 
implement this would be approved next year.  Moreover, he 
suggested that the Administration\'s focus on Public-Private 
Partnerships (PPPs) as tools to attract necessary 
infrastructure investment was overblown, arguing instead that 
straightforward concessions made more sense.  He was cautious 
about how quickly these measures would have an effect, 
venturing that \"Brazil won\'t hit sustained 6% growth right 
away.\"  But, even sustaining 3.5% growth would be double the 
rate of the last decade, he continued, and sustained growth 
would, in turn, encourage investment. 
 
16. (SBU) Having just returned from the Berlin finance G-20 
meeting, Meirelles was not concerned in the short-run about 
the weakening dollar.  There is no reason to panic, he said, 
although there clearly needed to be an adjustment of the U.S. 
current account numbers in the longer term.  Finance Minister 
Palocci, by contrast, appeared concerned about the manner in 
which this adjustment took place.  He stated that an 
adjustment must be made, and could be implemented either by 
the market or by monetary authorities.  Palocci said he hoped 
the U.S. authorities would do so, in order to ensure it was a 
gradual process.  It is the uncertainty about the manner of 
adjustment, less so than the adjustment itself, that could 
hurt open, emerging markets such as Brazil, Palocci opined. 
 
17.  (SBU) Palocci assured Shirzad that, while occasionally 
the subject of public controversy, there would be no 
backtracking on the GoB\'s orthodox macroeconomic policies. 
The task for the future, he stated, was to consolidate the 
microeconomic reforms, e.g., improving the business 
environment, strengthening credit markets and extending their 
reach, and improving the functioning of securities markets. 
The tax burden was high, Palocci admitted, noting the GOB was 
targetting tax reductions to stimulate long terms savings and 
reduce the tax burden on items that are staples for the poor. 
 He added that tax reductions also would be accorded to small 
businesses through a bill, recently sent to Congress, that 
would reduce the number and rates of taxes on small 
businesses and simplify business registration in an effort to 
reduce informality in the economy. 
 
18. (SBU) Turning to regional issues, Palocci admitted that 
he had some concerns about Argentina and Bolivia.  If 
Argentina did not reach a reasonable agreement with its 
creditors and its current growth stalled, it could cause some 
pain in the region, he said.  He did not foresee much direct 
effect from an Argentine crisis on the markets\' pricing of 
Brazil risk, but worried about the liquidity effects as 
investors reconsidered their overall appetite for emerging 
market risk.  Bolivia, is \"always tense,\" Palocci ventured, 
adding that the GOB has had an ongoing dialogue with both 
President Mesa and the opposition.  In addition to urging 
moderation, he observed, Brazil hopes to develop useful 
relationships that would allow it to play a mediating role, 
if necessary. 
 
Slightly Different View from Presidential Advisor Garcia 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
19.  (C)   In addition, D/NSA Shirzad met with GOB 
Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia, a 
long-time Workers Party stalwart with close ties to Lula. 
Garcia spent much of the meeting discussing the economic 
chaos Lula inherited upon assuming office and the steps the 
president has taken to right the economy.  Although Garcia 
cited much the same glowing economic numbers as Central Bank 
Chief Meirelles and FinMin Palocci, his presentation differed 
in several important respects. 
 
--  While Meirelles merely referred to the possibility of the 
GOB declining to renew its Standby Agreement with the IMF, 
Garcia stated that a definitive decision had been taken to 
forego an IMF program when the current agreement expired in 
March 2005, 
 
--  Unlike Meirelles - who thought that the maximum the 
Brazilian economy could expand without reigniting inflation 
was 3 to 3.5 percent - Garcia opined that sustainable growth 
of 4.5 to 4.7 percent was possible.  (Garcia noted that 
between 1930 and 1980, the country grew at an average growth 
rate of 6.7 percent.) 
 
--  In contrast to Meirelles and Palocci, who made clear that 
the GOB would maintain high interest rates as long as needed 
to staunch inflation, Garcia thought it essntial to lower 
interest rates as soon as possible to simulate investment. 
BNDES and the state-run commercial banks (Banco do Brasil, 
Caixa Economic Federal, and the GOB\'s Savings and Loan Bank) 
could shoulder the burden of financing much-needed public 
infrastructure investment, but lower rates overall were 
needed to generate a public/private investment boom. 
 
--  Garcia stated that the GOB would likely soon begin 
replenishing its international foreign exchange reserves 
given that the real had appreciated against the falling 
dollar.  With the lapse of the IMF Stand-by Program next 
year, he said, the GOB would have to do without immediate 
access to USD 25 million in potential IMF support -- though 
the GOB\'s estimated USD 9 billion current account surplus 
made the problem of foreign exchange supply much less acute. 
 
--  Garcia also proved fairly sanguine regarding the ability 
of the GOB to straighten out in short order its social safety 
net programs,  He thought that the Bolsa Familia program in 
which 4.5 million families participated in 2003, could be 
expanded to 6 families by the end of 2004 and 40 million by 
the end of 2006.  Similarly, he foresaw expansion in the 
coming months of the GOB\'s agricultural credit programs for 
small farmers -- which help sustain the rural poor. 
 
20. (C)  In reponse to a question from D/NSA Shirzad about 
GOB plans regarding tax policy, Garcia noted that under the 
previous Cardoso Administration taxes as a percentage of GDP 
had increased from 28 percent to 38 percent during a span of 
8 years.  The Lula Administration, he said, planned to 
implement a series of targetted VAT tax cuts aimed at 
stimulating key sectors -- such as investment and basic 
consumer goods.  Simultaneously, the GOB planned to simplify 
its VAT tax regime by imposing a uniform VAT tax rate across 
all its states (i.e., end the current \"guerra fiscal,\" 
whereby states compete in offering ever-sweeter tax breaks 
for industry relocation).  As for the income tax, Garcia 
declared, plans were in the works to make the system more 
progressive by increasing the number of tax brackets.  (He 
did not specify whether the GOB would make this move 
revenue-neutral.) 
 
21. (C)  Comment.  While Garcia\'s slightly different take on 
the sustainable growth rate of the economy and the need for 
lower interest rates reflects the  traditional PT emphasis on 
national development, Palocci and Meirelles remain firmly in 
charge of macro-economic policy.  Or as Meirelles put in at 
one point, \"as long as Palocci and I are around we are going 
to make sure that economic policy is based upon concrete 
data, not wishful thinking. However, if you see us leaving 
the government, then I would start to worry.\" 
 
Dinner with Sao Paulo Business Leaders 
-------------------------------------- 
 
22. (SBU)  Sao Paulo Consul General hosted a dinner for D/NSA 
Shirzad and Director Renigar on the evening of November 22. 
Dinner guests -- senior executives representing Brazilian and 
multinational companies in the banking, agro-industry, steel 
automobile, and packaging sectors -- noted that they believed 
Brazil and other member countries would be better served by 
converting Mercosur in a free trade area (as opposed to its 
current form of a customs union).  This, they observed, would 
leave individual membes free to negotiate other deals at 
their own pace, without having more protectionist members 
hold everyone else back.  One participant observed tha 
Argentine industry is now merely a shell of what it once was, 
commenting that his factory operating there is making a lot 
of money because all his Argentine competition went broke. 
The same participant criticized the GOB\'s ill-prepared 
negotiating procedures, pointing out that the GOB went into 
the recently-failed Mercosur/EU trade talks without 
sufficiently consulting and defining positions/strategies, 
and subsequently had to regroup after it was too late. 
Regarding attempts to resolve bilateral Brazilian/Argentine 
trade disputes, this participant was equally critical of the 
GOB\'s lack of consultation and preparation.  As a business 
member of the Brazilian team negotiating with Argentine 
counterparts, he stated that the Foreign Ministry gave the 
Brazilian private sector ten points on how to reach an 
agreement that were totally unrealistic, yet the MFA did not 
want to hear any disagreement.  He caustically remarked that 
if he ran a business the same way the GOB ran trade 
negotiations, he would be broke within a week.

SUBJECT:  BRAZIL LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT POLITICAL REFORMS TO 
PROMOTE DEMOCRATIZATION 
 
 
1. SUMMARY.  In 2003, the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies 
(lower house) restarted discussions on \"Political Reform\" - 
- a catch-all term covering proposals to strengthen 
political parties, reform campaign financing, and improve 
the country\'s electoral system.  Many proposals have been 
debated since the 1988 Constitution was passed, and they 
were distilled into two bills voted out this year by the 
Chamber\'s Ad Hoc Committee on Political Reform.  While the 
proposals are the subject of intense political maneuvering 
among the parties, there is a growing consensus here that 
Political Reform is a good idea for the parties, the 
voters, and democracy.  The current bills may pass into law 
next year, and they must pass by October 2005 if they are 
to be in effect for the October 2006 presidential and 
congressional elections. END SUMMARY. 
 
THE NEED FOR POLITICAL REFORM 
----------------------------- 
2.  Since Brazil returned to civilian rule and passed the 
1988 Constitution, its multi-party system has been 
criticized for its vulnerability to corruption in campaign 
financing, its institutionally weak parties, and its 
personalized culture in which parties more often revolve 
around individuals than ideology or substantive positions. 
Twenty-seven parties are currently registered in Brazil, 
with politicians jumping from one to another for short-term 
advantage.  There were nearly 200 party switches in the 
Federal Chamber of Deputies in the first 18 months of the 
52nd Congress (2003-2005).  Since 1992, at least six 
congressional committees have been created in both the 
Senate and Chamber to discuss the shortcomings of 
democratic institutions.  In early 2003, the Chamber 
reopened the debate and established an Ad Hoc Committee 
that presented two bills that have now gone to the 
Chamber\'s Justice Committee.  They will eventually be voted 
out to the floor and then go to the Senate for final 
passage.  President Lula da Silva supports the effort.  He 
has said repeatedly that he sees political reform as 
\"urgent and necessary to promote democratization in both 
Brazilian society and State\". 
 
SEVERAL BILLS NOW IN THE WORKS 
------------------------------ 
3.  The primary bill now under discussion is: Bill 2679/03, 
drafted by Deputy Ronaldo Caiado (PFL-Goias), passed by the 
Ad Hoc Committee in December 2003 and sent to the Justice 
Committee, where it is still under consideration.  Caiado\'s 
bill addresses: 
- campaign and party financing, to combat the mounting cost 
of electoral campaigns and candidate dependence on special 
interest money for campaign financing; 
- closed-list system, aimed at strengthening the link 
between politicians and their parties (Brazil now uses open 
lists to select its legislatures); 
- party federations, to replace short-term alliances of 
convenience; 
- lowering of thresholds (i.e., the percentage of votes in 
how many states each party must win in order to maintain 
its party status), to protect small parties that could be 
damaged by the new federation rule. 
 
4.  Two other bills are also part of the package: Bill 
1712/03 (also sponsored by Deputy Caiado and also waiting 
to be voted out by the Justice Committee), addresses party 
switching by mandating that candidates must be members of a 
party for a fixed period before they can run for any office 
under that party\'s banner; and a Constitutional amendment 
proposal that would put all of Brazil\'s elections on 
concurrent four-year cycles instead of the alternating two- 
year cycles as now.  The two Caiado bills will likely be 
debated together and pass in some form in the coming 
months.  The third bill, dealing with election cycles, has 
less support.  In addition, President Lula recently 
mentioned that he would support a single six-year term for 
Brazil\'s President, to replace the current system of four- 
year terms, with a President limited to serving no more 
than two terms consecutively.  This idea is not now in any 
of the bills, but could be attached in the future. 
 
5.  The two Caiado bills have languished in the Justice 
Committee because of opposition from the conservative 
parties in Lula\'s coalition (PL, PTB, and PP).  But that 
opposition may now be overcome: in a December meeting with 
Federal Deputies, President Lula highlighted political 
reform as his top legislative priority for 2005.  Once they 
get to the floor, the bills could have greater support from 
the opposition than in Lula\'s own coalition.  But the bills 
as written would significantly change the rules of the 
game, so they will generate fierce debate and may well be 
watered-down before becoming law.  The most controversial 
elements of the reforms are public campaign financing and 
closed lists --the very heart of the reforms.  According to 
the caucus leader of the coalition\'s PL party, Deputy 
Sandro Mabel: \"If they insist on closed lists and public 
finance, bye-bye reform\". 
 
POST ENCOURAGING DEBATE 
----------------------- 
6.  For many Brazilians, Political Reform is an opaque and 
complicated topic fit only for politicians.  There has been 
little public discussion, press analysis, or dissemination 
of information on how these bills could fundamentally 
impact Brazil\'s democracy.  Post is developing a project to 
sponsor a conference in early 2005 to discuss various 
elements of the proposed political reform and to bring 
together key Brazilian stakeholders, including politicians, 
journalists, academics, and representatives of civil 
society organizations, to inform and expand the national 
debate. 
 
COMMENT: DEMOCRACY HAS TO BE STRENGTHENED 
----------------------------------------- 
7.  In early 2004, a scandal involving one of Lula\'s senior 
advisors, Waldomiro Diniz, made clear the need to reform 
the Brazilian electoral and political parties system, 
especially campaign and party financing.  Diniz was caught 
on tape allegedly soliciting illegal campaign contributions 
from a numbers racketeer.  In addition, the long-running 
\"Banestado\" money-laundering investigation has uncovered 
evidence that several parties are financing campaigns with 
undeclared funds.  The Political Reform now in the Chamber 
of Deputies, (in the words of one Deputy) may not be the 
\"one Brazil wants, but the one Brazil can do\", yet these 
bills represent a significant first step in strengthening 
the electoral process. 
 
8.  The current system of open lists and private campaign 
financing has the support of many in Congress, including 
many in Lula\'s coalition.  This system makes the parties 
dependent on the candidates, rather than the other way 
around, while candidates become reliant on private 
interests for funding.  Thus, the lack of public 
participation and discussion on political reform make it 
easier for politicians to approve laws that will benefit 
themselves rather than the whole country or even their 
party.  Transparency and public participation are key to 
passing good political reform laws and key to making 
Brazil\'s democracy more responsive to the public.

AND FCS SECTIONS AT AMEMBASSY BRASILIA AND AMCONSULATE SAO 
PAULO. 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  DURING A NOVEMBER 
30-DECEMBER FCS-ORGANIZED GOLD KEY MISSION, BOEING VICE 
PRESIDENT THOMAS PICKERING, ACCOMPANIED BY ALEXANDER WATSON 
(A CONSULTANT FOR THE FIRM), JOHN WOJICK (LATAM VP FOR 
SALES), AND JEFF JOHNSON (VP FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OF 
INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS), MET WITH A SERIES OF BRAZILIAN 
GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR OFFICIALS IN VARIOUS MEETINGS 
IN SAO PAULO, SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS AND BRASILIA.  TOPICS 
DISCUSSED DURING THE VISIT INCLUDED THE UPCOMING SHAKEOUT IN 
BRAZIL\'S CIVAIR SECTOR, DEBT OWED TO BOEING BY VARIG, 
POSSIBLE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL FIRMS, AND POTENTIAL 
AIRCRAFT SALES.  IN ADDITION, IN THEIR TALKS WITH MFA 
INTERLOCUTORS, PICKERING AND WATSON OFFERED THEIR VIEWS ON 
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S, AND THE EU ON AIRCRAFT 
SUBSIDIES AS WELL AS THE STATE OF U.S.-BRAZIL BILATERAL 
RELATIONS.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
CIVAIR RESTRUCTURING 
 
3. (C) IN THEIR DECEMBER 2 MEETINGS WITH MINISTER OF 
DEVELOPMENT, INDUSTRY, AND COMMERCE FURLAN AND OTHER GOB 
OFFICIALS, PICKERING, WATSON, AND WOJICK OUTLINED THEIR 
THINKING ABOUT THE LIKELY FACTORS THE GOB WILL HAVE TO 
CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO BAIL OUT THE AILING BRAZILIAN 
CARRIER VARIG.  VARIG\'S TREMENDOUS DEBT BURDEN, THEY MADE 
CLEAR, WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SAVE THE AIRLINE.  (THE 
BOEING TEAM\'S OVERALL ANALYSIS ALONG THE LINES OF THAT 
CONTAINED IN REFTEL)  OVERALL, BOEING\'S GOB INTERLOCUTORS 
WERE RELUCTANT TO COMMENT ON WHAT THEIR GOVERNMENT WOULD 
LIKELY DO, THOUGH THEIR BODY LANGUAGE INDICATED THAT VARIG 
WAS YET ANOTHER HEADACHE WHICH SOONER OR LATER THEY WOULD 
HAVE TO DEAL WITH. 
 
4. (C) GOB VICE-PRESIDENT (AND ALSO DEFMIN) ALENCAR HAD MORE 
TO SAY ABOUT THE VARIG PROBLEM.  IN HIS DECEMBER 2 MEETING 
WITH PICKERING, WATSON ET. AL., ALENCAR MADE THE FOLLOWING 
KEY POINTS: 
 
-- THE GOB WANTS VARIG TO SUCCEED, BUT THE SITUATION IS \"VERY 
DIFFICULT.\"  ALENCAR SAID THAT HE HAD EXAMINED THE COMPANY\'S 
BOTTOM LINE, AND IT WAS \"A HORROR.\"  UNFORTUNATELY, THE 
COMPANY PRESIDENT AND THE FOUNDATION THAT GOVERNED VARIG WERE 
IN DENIAL, INSISTING THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND REFUSING TO 
ENGAGE SUBSTANTIVELY ON POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS WITH GOB, 
CREDITORS, EMPLOYEE UNION AND GOL/TAM REPS.  IN A RECENT 
MEETING HOSTED BY THE GOB, VARIG MANAGEMENT REPS DID NOT SHOW 
UP. 
 
-- THE GOB CONTINUED TO BELIEVE THAT THE WAY OUT COULD WELL 
INVOLVE TEAMING VARIG UP WITH LOCAL CARRIERS GOL AND/OR TAM, 
WITH A PRACTICAL RATIONALIZATION OF DOMESTIC AND 
INTERNATIONAL ROUTES AND OTHER RIGHT-SIZING MEASURES. 
ALENCAR SAID THE SITUATION HAD REACHED A LEVEL OF GRAVITY 
WHERE IT MIGHT WELL BE NECESSARY TO CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW 
SUCCESSOR COMPANY TO VARIG.  THE \"OLD VARIG\" WOULD REMAIN AS 
THE VEHICLE FOR JUDICIAL SETTLEMENTS AND LIQUIDATIONS, WHILE 
THE NEW COMPANY WOULD BECOME OPERATIONAL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH 
ONE/BOTH OF THE OTHER AIRLINES, THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE TO CARRY 
ON WITH SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS. 
 
-- THE EMPLOYEE UNIONS AND MANAGEMENT MUST BECOME ENGAGED 
WITH EACH OTHER REALISTICALLY ON SUCH ISSUES AS TRANSFER OF 
POSITIONS FROM OLD COMPANY TO NEW, DOWNSIZING/BUY-OUT 
PROGRAMS, EMPLOYEE RIGHTS, ETC., AND ALENCAR THOUGHT THAT WAS 
NOT HAPPENING. 
 
-- ALENCAR WAS SURPRISED BY THE SIZE OF VARIG\'S DEBT TO 
BOEING, AND STRONGLY URGED BOEING TO USE ITS LEVERAGE WITH 
VARIG MANAGEMENT TO URGE THEM TO BECOME SERIOUSLY ENGAGED IN 
A NEGOTIATION PROCESS WITH GOB, UNIONS, TAM/GOL WITH A VIEW 
TO FINDING A SOLUTION.  PICKERING AND WATSON UNDERTOOK TO DO 
SO. 
 
-- THE GOB, TOGETHER WITH ITS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK 
(BNDES), WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP BROKER A DEAL AND THEN 
PROVIDE FINANCING IF THE PROJECT LOOKED VIABLE.  THE GOB 
COULD MOVE WITH ALACRITY IF VARIG MANAGEMENT WOULD ONLY GET 
ENGAGED, ALENCAR SAID.  BUT THE GOB DID NOT/NOT INTEND AN 
OUTRIGHT BAIL-OUT OF VARIG JUST TO SAVE A GLORIOUS AVIATION 
NAME AND SYMBOL OF BRAZILIAN PRIDE, HE ADDED. 
 
5. (C) NOTE: BASED UPON RECENT PRESS REPORTING AND POST\'S 
SUBSEQUENT CONTACTS WITH LULA\'S CASA CIVIL, IT NOW APPEARS 
THAT THE GOB WILL MOVE WITH RESPECT TO VARIG SOON AFTER THE 
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.  OUR CONTACTS WITHIN THE PRESIDENT\'S 
OFFICE TELL US THAT THE GOB IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING SEVERAL 
ALTERNATIVES.  THE FIRST WOULD BE ISSUANCE OF A PRESIDENTIAL 
DECREE ALLOWING THE GOB TO INTERVENE IN VARIG, BREAKING UP 
THE COMPANY AND DISPOSING OF ITS ASSETS.  ANOTHER OPTION 
UNDER CONSIDERATION, WE WERE TOLD, WAS A PRIVATE TAKEOVER, 
WITH TAM AND GOL DIVIDING UP AS MUCH OF THE COMPANY AS 
POSSIBLE.  STILL UNCLEAR IS WHETHER TAM/GOL WOULD INHERIT THE 
VARIG PENSION FUND (WHICH ITSELF IS IN DEFICIT) AND WHO WOULD 
PAY VARIG\'S OUTSTANDING DEBT.  YET A THIRD VARIANT WOULD BE 
THE INVOLVEMENT OF A FOREIGN INVESTOR.  OUR SOURCE TOLD US 
THAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING WITH AN UNNAMED MAJOR EUROPEAN 
CORPORATION WHICH IS INTERESTED IN PURCHASING AN INTEREST IN 
THE CARRIER.  PRESUMABLY THIS WOULD BE A MINORITY STAKE AS 20 
PERCENT 
IS THE MAXIMUM FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF AN AIRLINE ALLOWABLE 
UNDER BRAZILIAN LAW.  WHILE ONE RECENT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE 
ASSERTED THAT PORTUGUESE CHARTER AIRLINE EURO ATLANTIC WAS IN 
DISCUSSIONS WITH BNDES FOR THE PURCHASE OF 20 PERCENT OF 
VARIG, GOB SPOKESMEN TELL US THAT EURO ATLANTIC IS NOW OUT OF 
THE PICTURE.  MEANWHILE, A LOCAL COURT HAS JUST RULED IN 
FAVOR OF VARIG IN THE LATTER\'S 2.5 BILLION REAIS LAWSUIT 
AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH THE GOB IS APPEALING 
THIS DECISION.  (VARIG\'S TOTAL DEBT IS NEAR 7 BILLION REAIS). 
 
 
AIRCRAFT SUBSIDIES 
 
6. (C) ON DECEMBER 2, THE BOEING DELEGATION HAD A FRIENDLY, 
INFORMAL BREAKFAST AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
PRESENT FOR THE GOB SIDE WERE AMBASSADOR RUY NOGUEIRA (U/S 
FOR COOPERATION AND COMMUNITIES ABROAD), AMBASSADOR ANTONIO 
DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S CHIEF OF STAFF), 
AMBASSADOR MARIO VILALVA (HEAD OF THE BUSINESS PROMOTION 
OFFICE), MINISTER PAULO CESAR DE MEIRA DE VASCONCELLOS (U/S 
NOGUEIRA\'S DEPUTY),  COUNSELOR RALPH PETER HENDERSON (CHIEF 
OF THE IMMIGRATION DIVISION), AND FABIO MENDES MARZANO 
(ADVISOR TO U/S NOGUEIRA). 
 
7. (C) PICKERING MADE THE CASE FOR ELIMINATION OF GOVERNMENT 
SUBSIDIES TO AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS (I.E., AIRBUS) AND URGED 
THE GOB TO JOIN TALKS ON A MULTILATERAL OECD ACCORD ON 
AIRCRAFT SUBSIDIES.  SUCH AN ACCORD, PICKERING STATED, WOULD 
HELP FILL THE VOID LEFT AFTER THE USG\'S RECENT ABROGATION OF 
A 1992 BILATERAL 1992 U.S.-EU UNDERSTANDING ON THIS ISSUE. 
(ABROGATION OF THE 1992 ACCORD COMES IN THE WAKE OF A 1994 
WTO DECISION BANNING AIRCRAFT SUBSIDIES AND A WTO CASED FILED 
BY THE USG THIS YEAR AGAINST EU SUBSIDIES IN VIOLATION OF 
THAT DECISION.)  PICKERING MADE CLEAR THAT BOEING HAD HAD 
EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS WITH USTR ZOELLICK ON THIS ISSUE AND 
THAT THE USG HAD BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF BOEING\'S CONCERNS. 
NOGUEIRA STATED THAT THE GOB WANTED TO BE AT THE TABLE IF ANY 
MULTILATERAL ACCORD IS TO BE NEGOTIATED, ADDING THAT 
BRAZILIAN OFFICIALS WERE PRESENT AT RECENT 
MULTILATERAL/BILATERAL TALKS IN PARIS ON THIS ISSUE. 
 
U.S.-BRAZIL TRADE RELATIONS AND UNSC SEAT 
8. (C) SPEAKING PERSONALLY, PICKERING EXPRESSED GENERAL 
SUPPORT FOR THE GOB\'S CAMPAIGN TO GET A PERMANENT UNSC SEAT 
AND NOTED THAT, BASED UPON HIS EXPERIENCE AS USUN PERM REP, 
HE THOUGHT THAT UNSC EXPANSION SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN 
AGREEMENT (FORMAL OR INFORMAL) THAT NO UNSC MEMBER WOULD VETO 
A RESOLUTION NOT INVOLVING ITS OWN COUNTRY UNLESS AT LEAST 
THREE UNSC MEMBERS WERE PREPARED TO ALSO VOTE NO. 
 
9. (SBU) WITH RESPECT TO TRADE, PATRIOTA MADE CLEAR THAT THE 
GOB\'S CURRENT PRIORITY WAS SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDING THE DOHA 
ROUND.  HE SAID THAT PRIOR TO THE GENEVA MEETING EARLIER THIS 
YEAR, MANY WERE LOOKING AT THE G-20 AS AN OBSTRUCTIONIST 
ELEMENT -- BUT THAT VIEWS HAD CHANGED IN THE WAKE OF THE KEY 
ROLE THAT BRAZIL PLAYED IN ACHIEVING CONSENSUS ON THE GENEVA 
FRAMEWORK.  TURNING TO THE FTAA, PATRIOTA NOTED THAT TALKS 
HAD BEEN DIFFICULT UP TO THIS POINT.  HE OPINED THAT THERE 
WERE SEVERAL VIEWS WITHIN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AS TO NEXT 
STEPS, BUT ADDED THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S VIEW (AND THE VIEW THAT 
WOULD PRESUMABLY PREVAIL) WAS THAT THE FTAA AS IT CURRENTLY 
WAS SHAPING UP SIMPLY DID NOT OFFER BRAZIL ENOUGH.  IN 
RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM PICKERING ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE 
MERCOSUR-EU  TALKS, PATRIOTA SAID THAT THE SAME WAS TRUE WITH 
RESPECT TO THOSE NEGOTIATIONS.  PATRIOTA CLOSED BY NOTING 
THAT REPORTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS GOB 
MINISTRIES ON TRADE POLICY (I.E., THE MINISTRIES OF 
AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT/COMMERCE VS. THE MFA) WERE A BIT 
OVERBLOWN.  TO THE EXTENT THAT DIFFERENT AGENCIES HAD 
DIFFERENT POSITIONS, HE SAID, THIS SIMPLY MIRRORED THE 
SITUATION IN THE U.S.

1. (SBU) Summary: Brazil\'s economic growth continues at 
scorching rates.  According to third quarter statistics, 
growth in the 12 months through September 2004 was 5.3%, 
putting 5% growth for 2004 as a whole well within reach. 
Central Bank President Henrique Meirelles confirmed the 
rosy economic outlook in a December 8 meeting with the 
Ambassador.  With external vulnerability reduced, Meirelles 
saw the balance of risks ahead shifting from the economic 
to the political.  Pushing the microeconomic reform agenda 
through the Congress, he affirmed, was a sine qua non for 
sustaining relatively healthy growth rates.  With the 
politically-charged election season behind it, the Congress 
may be able to focus on the reforms, such as the new 
bankruptcy law, which on December 14 finished an 11-year 
voyage to final approval, he added.  Meirelles professed 
not to be panicked about the dollar\'s extraordinary slide 
on world currency markets, but thought that there would 
have to be an adjustment in the U.S. current account in the 
medium term.  The Central Bank bought dollars in the Sao 
Paulo currency market December 6, ostensibly to bolster 
reserves prior to the March expiry of the IMF program (ref 
B).  The intervention has effectively put a floor on the 
dollar\'s drop against the Real.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Recent official GoB statistics for the third quarter 
of 2004 show economic growth continuing at what is, for 
Brazil, a scorching rate.  Growth in the twelve months 
through September 2004 clocked in at 5.3%.  Financial 
sector expectations of 5% growth for 2004 look likely to be 
borne out.  The data (see table below) show, however, a 
clear slowing trend in the quarter-on-quarter growth 
figures.  This suggests that the economy already has begun 
to cool off after clocking annualized growth rates of well 
over six percent for the three quarters beginning in 
September 2003.  This may be good news on the inflation 
front, since 1% growth quarter-on-quarter (4% annualized) 
is much closer to what the Central Bank currently believes 
is the economy\'s potential growth (i.e. 3% to 4%).  Export 
growth, while still healthy, appears to be on a cooling 
trend as well.  As an aside, overall 2003 GDP Growth of 
negative 0.2%, was revised upwards to positive 0.5%.

Living in the (Macroeconomic) Moment 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) In their December 8 meeting, Meirelles told the 
Ambassador that Brazil is living its best economic moment 
in recent memory.  The combination of strong growth 
(expected to be about 5% for the year), inflation under 
control, declining debt-to-GDP ratios and a strong external 
balance makes this growth cycle much more sustainable than 
previous spurts.  As Brazil\'s external vulnerability had 
fallen, Brazil risk, measured by the spread above 
treasuries on Brazilian Eurobonds, had fallen to about 400 
basis points.  With external vulnerabilities reduced, the 
risks Brazil faces now, Meirelles argued, were political. 
 
4. (SBU) Meirelles expects growth to slow next year to what 
he said he \"hoped\" was its current potential growth rate, 
3.0% to 3.5%.  While acknowledging that this is slow for a 
country with huge social problems, Meirelles pointed out 
that Brazil\'s average growth over the last decade had been 
1.8%.  People underestimate the damage that the lack of 
macroeconomic stability did to growth potential, Meirelles 
affirmed.  With stability restored, businesses had a 
planning horizon and could begin to invest again.  This 
investment initially grabbed the \"low-hanging fruit,\" 
boosting productivity by de-bottlenecking or adding shifts 
at factories.  This initial round of productivity 
increases, he stated, likely could sustain growth at about 
3.5%.  It was crucial, to push the microeconomic reform 
agenda, which would begin the hard work of increasing 
productivity -- and thereby potential growth. 
 
Inflation and Investment 
------------------------ 
 
5. (U) Two pieces of data in the recently released 
statistics, the growth in investment and the growth in 
industry, speak to the twin issues of inflation and 
investment that Meirelles and the Central Bank face right 
now (ref A).  Industrial growth in the third quarter was 
2.8% over the previous quarter, continuing a surprisingly 
strong upward trend.  This reflects record capacity 
utilization in many industries, according to recent 
surveys.  The high level of capacity utilization appears to 
be driving some of the inflationary pressure that the 
Central Bank currently is trying to wring out of the 
system, including with its December 15 interest rate hike 
(to 17.75%), the third in as many months.  The second 
surprising result was the 6.7% growth in investment for the 
third quarter.  Investment growth has exceeded GDP growth 
in each of the last four quarters, which bodes well for 
increasing capacity and productivity and improving 
sustainable growth rates.  This data, however, does not 
reflect the impact on investment, if any, of the Central 
Bank\'s interest rate hikes since September. 
 
Bankruptcy Law Passed 
--------------------- 
 
6. (U) After an eleven-year journey through the Brazilian 
Congress, a law reforming Brazil\'s bankruptcy code was 
passed December 14.  The bill now goes to the President for 
signature.  The new law aims to create the opportunity, as 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code does, for firms in 
financial straits to negotiate a restructuring with their 
creditors outside the courtroom.  Only if the company and 
its creditors were unable to reach agreement on a 
restructuring, would there be a need for a judge to become 
involved.  In the event that a company ultimately is 
declared bankrupt and liquidated, the new law gives 
commercial creditors higher priority to collect their debts 
than under the old system, addressing a longstanding 
bankers\' complaint.  Banks will now be second in line to 
collect debts from the bankrupt company, after employees. 
Under the previous law, debts to the government had 
seniority over commercial creditors and there were no 
limits on how much a judge could award to workers. 
 
Dollar\'s Slide 
-------------- 
 
7. (U) Meirelles told the Ambassador there was \"no reason 
to panic\" about the dollar\'s slide in world currency 
markets in the short term, but that U.S. current account 
must adjust in the longer term.  Brazilian businesses, 
however, have been expressing deep concern that the 
dollar\'s fall will price them out of export markets. 
Against that backdrop, the Central Bank intervened in the 
foreign exchange markets December 6 to purchase an unknown, 
but likely relatively modest, amount of dollars.  The day 
after, the dollar appreciated 0.37%.  The Bank has said 
that this was merely the first of several planned small 
purchases in its effort to begin rebuilding its foreign 
exchange reserves ahead of the March 2005 expiration of the 
IMF program.  The markets have interpreted the move as a 
clear signal that the Central Bank will not accept an 
exchange rate below R$2.7. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) The GoB\'s primary task now is working to increase 
the level of sustainable growth, a process which entails 
implementation of the microeconomic reform agenda.  With 
the municipal elections behind it, the GoB is in a better 
position to focus on moving the reform agenda through 
Congress.  The post-election passage of the bankruptcy 
reform as well as passage of a portion of the judicial 
reform are welcome signs that the Congress may be returning 
to the job.  But, the departure of the PMDB and PPS from 
the governing coalition to better position themselves for 
the 2006 presidential elections, while by no means 
crippling the GoB\'s ability to get its legislative agenda 
through Congress, may mean a more chaotic road ahead (ref 
C).

     C. 03 BRASILIA 3292 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  A year and a half after its promising 
start, the Brazilian Congress\'s \"Banestado\" inquiry --an 
investigation into a vast money-laundering scheme involving 
hundreds of Brazilian politicians, criminals, and 
businesspersons-- has come to an inglorious end.  The 
investigative committee never looked at all of the voluminous 
documents in its possession, and in recent months, 
politicized leaks from the committee\'s files tarred public 
figures and damaged the reputations of the committee and its 
leaders.  On December 14 the committee finally issued its 
final report: a carefully-worded document that drew charges 
that it was protecting high-level politicians.  It then 
issued a counter-report, equally politicized, a week later. 
Whether or not either report is ever formally approved by 
Congress, the long life and pathetic death of the Banestado 
inquiry represent not only a missed opportunity to conduct a 
serious investigation into a huge corruption scheme, but they 
also undermine the credibility of all other congressional 
inquiries present and future.  The Brazilian Federal Police 
and Public Prosecutor will continue with their own 
investigations.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BANESTADO - BILLIONS LAUNDERED 
------------------------------ 
2. (SBU) \"Banestado\" was the name of the State Bank of Parana 
in southern Brazil which, during the 1990s, was at the center 
of a massive scheme by which drug lords, business owners, and 
political parties laundered illicit cash through phony bank 
accounts set up by money-changers in the Foz de Iguacu area. 
Much of the money was transferred to the Banestado branch and 
other financial houses in New York --including the notorious 
Beacon Hill-- and then transferred again to tax haven 
countries.  Investigators believe as much as US$30 billion 
may have been laundered by the complicated scheme.  In 2000, 
Banestado was privatized and sold to Itau Bank, and the 
pre-sale examination of its records tipped investigators to 
the money laundering. 
 
HIGH-LEVEL SUSPECTS 
------------------- 
3. (SBU) Well-known figures whose names have come up during 
the Banestado inquiry include: former Sao Paulo Governor and 
current Federal Deputy Luiz Antonio Fleury; former PSDB party 
Treasurer Ricardo Sergio, who may have funded the party\'s 
campaigns with illegal cash; leading PFL Senator Jorge 
Bornhausen whose family was linked to one of the suspect 
banks; former Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf, whose massive 
embezzlement schemes on city contracts while he was in office 
are still being investigated; former Parana Governor Jaime 
Lerner; former Sao Paulo Mayor Celso Pitta; current Central 
Bank President Henrique Meirelles; and former Bank of Brazil 
President Cassio Casseb.  Some of these individuals may not 
have been involved in wrongdoing, but only had their names 
leaked for partisan purposes. 
 
CONGRESS RELUCTANTLY OPENS AN INQUIRY 
------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) With the political stakes so high, and with little 
confidence in the Federal Police investigation, Congress 
reluctantly set up a joint \"Parliamentary Inquiry Committee\" 
(CPI) in June 2003, chaired by Senator Antero Paes Barros (of 
the opposition PSDB) with Deputy Jose Mentor (from President 
Lula\'s PT) as rapporteur.  A CPI can call witnesses and issue 
subpoenas, but cannot issue indictments.  A CPI\'s final 
product is a written report that the Federal Police and 
Prosecutor can use in their investigations.  Several of the 
CPI\'s members, including Sen. Barros and Dep. Mentor, visited 
New York and Washington to meet with US law enforcement 
authorities in 2003 accompanied by embassy Legatt and 
returned with documents related to the case. 
 
5. (SBU) The term of the Banestado CPI was repeatedly 
extended --it was due to conclude its investigation in 
December 2003, but only issued its final report in December 
2004.  In the meantime, it called many mid-level banking and 
technical witnesses to testify but never called any of the 
high-profile politicians.  The CPI subpoenaed some 1,400 
confidential bank and telephone records of individuals and 
 
SIPDIS 
businesses, but then was not able to sort through all the 
cartons of sensitive documents it collected (the material 
reportedly included details on 1.6 million financial 
transactions). 
THE CPI RUNS OFF THE RAILS 
-------------------------- 
6. (SBU) By mid-2004, the CPI had become polarized along 
party lines.  The situation was worsened by party squabbling 
in the runup to the October 2004 municipal elections.  The 
CPI\'s two leading officials (Sen. Barros and Dep. Mentor) are 
from the PT and PSDB --the same two parties that went 
head-to-head in many of the key races in October.  Leaks of 
sensitive information from the CPI\'s files, implicating 
well-known politicians, began showing up in the newspapers in 
June and July.  For example, one leak raised suspicions that 
Central Bank President Henrique Meirelles used the Banestado 
network to hide undeclared assets, leading the administration 
to push through a law giving him the legal protections of a 
cabinet official:  criminal charges against him will be heard 
only by the Supreme Court and not a common court.  The leaks 
then led to counter-charges that some committee staffers may 
have been charging extortion fees to destroy incriminating 
files.  Next, the fact that the CPI\'s rapporteur, Dep. 
Mentor, subpoenaed many more bank and phone records than he 
could ever review raised suspicions that he was on a fishing 
expedition against PSDB-associated officials.  Finally, the 
committee simply lacked good sense and failed to show due 
diligence in the course of its investigations, for example 
not calling important witnesses while focusing on procedural 
details. 
 
DEPRESSING FINAL REPORT 
----------------------- 
7. (CPI) On December 14, the rapporteur, Dep. Mentor, issued 
his 1,500 page report, which requests prosecutors to indict 
91 individuals and proposes amnesty for anyone else if they 
repatriate their money to Brazil.  Only two of the 91 names 
are well-known:  former-Sao Paulo Mayor Celso Pitta and 
former-Central Bank President (under President Cardoso) 
Gustavo Franco.  Opposition parties quickly complained that 
the report was one-sided.  For example, it cites Franco for 
entirely official acts when he implemented mechanisms to 
regulate currency flows in the 1990s.  Meanwhile, the report 
fails to name Paulo Maluf --widely believed to have embezzled 
hundreds of millions of dollars during his term as Sao Paulo 
mayor in the 1990s.  Opposition leaders suggested that 
Mentor, a close ally of Sao Paulo Mayor Marta Suplicy, kept 
Maluf\'s name out of the report in return for Maluf supporting 
Suplicy\'s reelection bid in October 2004.  Suplicy lost 
anyway. 
 
8. (SBU) In response, Dep. Mentor hinted that the CPI\'s 
Chairman, Sen. Barros, failed to question a Brazilian crime 
boss now jailed in Uruguay, who allegedly bankrolled Barros\'s 
last campaign.  Mentor also pointed out that all of the CPI\'s 
files are being turned over to the Federal Police and Public 
Prosecutor\'s Office, whom he urges to conduct thorough 
investigations.  The craziness did not stop there.  A week 
after Mentor issued his report, Sen. Barros issued his own 
counter-report in which he calls for the indictment of both 
Maluf and current Central Bank President Meirelles.  The 
committee is supposed to vote approval of the final report to 
make it official.  With competing reports, a bitterly divided 
committee, and Congress about to go into recess until 
February, it seems unlikely that either report will be 
approved this year, if ever. 
 
COMMENT - ENOUGH BLAME TO GO AROUND 
----------------------------------- 
9. (SBU)  Congress typically establishes CPI inquiries in 
high-profile cases, where there is a concern that law 
enforcement authorities, if they were acting without the 
political cover of a CPI, could be subject to political 
pressures.  Not surprisingly, many CPIs turn into 
grandstanding opportunities for congress, but sometimes they 
succeed in focusing public attention on important issues. 
The Banestado CPI reached a new nadir because it made no 
significant findings in its investigations and it undermined 
rather than supported the ongoing Federal Police and 
Prosecutor\'s investigations.  When it turned into a partisan 
food fight (with Sen. Barros calling Dep. Mentor a \"Joseph 
Goebbels follower, who thinks that if you tell a lie one 
hundred times that it becomes the truth\"), it sullied the 
image of all CPIs, likely leaving the public far less willing 
than ever to have confidence in Congress\'s ability to carry 
out a thorough and transparent inquiry.  There is enough 
blame to go around in the Banestado case.  DANILOVICH

1.4 (b & 
 d) 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  At midnight, December 31st, Brazil\'s F-X 
jet fighter competition will come to an end. Ultimately, a 
decision on the costly program proved to be politically 
untenable for the Lula administration.  Given all the urgent 
requirements of Brazil\'s armed forces, the F-X was an expense 
that was hard to justify.  Competitors for the F-X are 
refusing to go down quietly, but they are fighting a losing 
battle.  With the end of the F-X, the GOB may review whether 
to purchase less costly used aircraft. In this regard, the 
Lockheed Martin F-16 would have the inside track.  However, 
it is possible that the GOB may base a decision on used F-16s 
in the context of its continued questions about the U.S. as a 
reliable supplier.  End Summary 
 
The F-X Program, RIP 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  On December 31, the Best and Final Offers (BOFAs) 
for the competition to select Brazil\'s new generation high 
performance jet fighter (F-X) will expire.  Despite repeated 
GOB postponements during the past 12 months on a decision, 
the F-X program had still retained a breath of life thanks to 
repeated hints from former Defense Minister Viegas that a F-X 
award decision would be forthcoming.  Throughout the process, 
however, the Lula administration was reluctant to commit to a 
choice.  With the end of the validity of the BOFAs next week, 
the F-X program will be officially dead. 
 
3.  (SBU)  The principal cause of the program\'s demise, most 
observers agree, was the F-X program\'s steep price tag, 
around $700 million plus for the purchase of a dozen high 
performance aircraft.  The huge cost, at a time when the Lula 
administration was engaged in fiscal austerity, made the 
program a politically impossible sell.  (Note:  The Brazilian 
Congress, which still has not concluded the 2005 budget, has 
not included jet fighters in its budget, and, in fact, 
provides very little money overall for defense.  End Note.) 
Yet, until November, more than a few senior Brazilian Air 
Force (FAB) officers held out hope that FAB would get its new 
jets.  When Russian President Putin departed Brazil last 
month without a deal in place for the Sukhoi SU-35 -- after 
offering to purchase 50 Embraer commercial aircraft as a deal 
sweetener and certainly dangling a possible agreement on 
ending the Russian embargo on Brazilian beef -- the last best 
chance for new fighter aircraft for FAB left with him 
(reftel). 
 
4.  (SBU)  Other factors contributed to the F-X impasse.  The 
Brazilian military\'s almost insatiable need for weapons 
systems upgrade and procurement required that the GOB triage 
the competing demands for funding.  FAB already had been 
granted approval for buying ten new Black Hawk helicopters 
(about $153 million).  With both the army and navy biting at 
FAB\'s heels for funding their own urgent requirements, the 
new jet fighters became a harder sell. 
 
5.  (SBU)  In view of the lack of any perceived threat, the 
strategic question of whether Brazil needed the F-X whose 
primary purpose was protection of the national capital, has 
received relatively little debate.  The program itself 
ultimately owed its continued rationale less to the defense 
of Brasilia than as a tool of national pride, particularly 
following Chile\'s purchase of F-16s.  Even some air force 
generals admit the principal current threat to Brazilian 
sovereignty (from narco-trafficers) can be addressed less 
expensively by other air force elements such as FAB\'s Super 
Tucanos. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Meanwhile, F-X competitors are refusing to go down 
without a fight.  Planted news articles in praise of one 
aircraft or attacking another (usually the F-16, and the 
alleged, and false, denial by the USG to provide AAMRAM 
capability to Brazil) continue to pop up.  The most recent 
example of F-X muckraking is a cover story this week in 
left-leaning nationalist magazine Carta Capital in praise of 
the Mirage 2000 of the Embraer-Dassault consortium.  In the 
Carta Capital article, Embraer President Mauricio Botelho, in 
a direct swipe at Lockheed-Martin, is quoted as saying that 
because the USG won\'t allow it, U.S. companies offer \"no 
chance\" for transfer of military-related technology -- a 
bizarre comment in the wake of the winning 
Embraer--Lockheed-Martin bid for the development of the U.S. 
Army\'s Aerial Common Sensor System aircraft. Even Sweden\'s 
Grippen aircraft has received high profile lobbying with a 
prominent billboard at the entrance to Brasilia airport. 
 
Used Aircraft? 
-------------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  Throughout much of the long-running F-X 
competition -- while Lockheed Martin\'s F-16 was one of the 
competitors -- the U.S. company had urged the GOB consider 
the purchase of used F-16s as a significantly less costly 
option to the F-X.  Although an attempt by Lockheed-Martin in 
early 2003 to ally with Varig Engineering and Maintenance 
(VEM) for a proposed upgrade of used F-16s fell through, the 
company remains upbeat it will be able to partner with a 
Brazilian firm (possibly Embraer) to craft an attractive used 
aircraft offer.  Ultimately, Lockheed Martin believes it can 
provide fully capable F-16 aircraft at less than half the 
cost of the F-X. (Note: One driving factor, however, will be 
the ability of FAB to conduct inter-operable aerial refueling 
for any fighter.  Brazil is considering purchasing two or 
three KC-135s to augment their refueling capability. 
Procurement of KC-135s from the U.S. would be a positive 
indicator for purchase of used F-16s.  End note.) 
 
8.  (SBU)  In recognition that new aircraft will be 
unobtainable, senior FAB leadership, including FAB\'s probable 
next Commander in Chief, increasingly have come around to 
accepting used F-16s as Brazil\'s best aircraft option.  In 
this context, the F-16 appears to have the inside track over 
other used aircraft options, although there are rumors that 
some in FAB may be looking at procuring used South African 
Cheetahs, a modified Mirage III aircraft one generation older 
than the early F-16 models.  Meanwhile, the Brazilian 
Congress which has been absent from the F-X debate, may get 
into the picture.  In a discussion with emboffs, a prominent 
Deputy on the National Defense Committee stated he intended 
to hold hearings in 2005 on used fighter aircraft with an eye 
to promoting the F-16 as Brazil\'s best option. 
 
9.  (C)  Comment:  We expect that Brazil will continue to 
seek the aquisition of high performance jet fighters for 
reasons of national pride, if nothing else.  U.S. Mission 
Brazil will continue to support the used F-16 option as the 
most logical way forward both tactically and economically. 
An increasing number of FAB generals appear to support this 
view.  However, even though Brazil has moved forward on the 
purchase of other weapons systems, we suspect the GOB may not 
agree to purchase the F-16 unless it achieves an adequate 
comfort level on all aspects of the bilateral pol-mil 
relationship.  As Brazil observes the bite that ASPA is 
taking on countries that do not sign Article 98 agreements, 
it questions about the reliability of the U.S. as a 
supplier/strategic partner will continue, thus further 
complicating the used F-16 aquisition option.

SUBJECT:  LULA\'S INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL SCHEDULE FOR 2005 
 
 
1.  According to the Ministry of External Relations, 
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will make at 
least thirteen international trips during 2005, continuing 
the feverish pace of his first two years in office.  Lula\'s 
principal foreign policy objectives during his travels will 
continue to be to obtain international support for a 
permanent Brazilian seat at the United National Security 
Council and to enhance South-South strategic cooperation. 
Throughout his travels, the President will also emphasize 
investment opportunities in Brazil. 
 
2.  Following is Lula\'s planned international itinerary: 
 
a.January: Davos, Switzerland, to attend the 
World Economic Forum; 
b.February: Guiana (courtesy visit) and Suriname 
(Caricom meeting) -- the last two South 
American countries unvisited by Lula; 
c.March: Montevideo for Uruguayan President 
Vasquez\'s inauguration; 
d.April: Africa (most likely Nigeria, Senegal, 
and Tunisia) - this would be Lula\'s third 
African trip; 
e.May: Japan and South Korea for \"reciprocal\" 
visits (Presidents Junichiro Koizume and Roh 
Moo-Hyun visited Brazil in 2004); 
f.June:  Asuncion for a Mercosul meeting, and, 
 and, 
if invited, Scotland for G-8 Summit; 
g.July: Paris for the celebration of French 
National Day, Lisbon for a summit meeting of 
the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries 
(CLDP; 
h.September: New York for the opening of UNGA; 
i.October: Moscow (President Putin visited 
Brazil in late 2004); 
j.December:  Montevideo to attend a Mercosul 
meeting. 
 
3.  In addition, on May 10-11, Brazil will host the Arab- 
Latin American Summit.  Following past practice, it is also 
very likely that Lula will travel extensively to other 
regional capitals for various events not yet scheduled. 
 
4.  Comment:  While complaints may continue to arise about 
Lula\'s frequent absences from Brazil, on the whole the 
President\'s travels generally generate positive publicity 
and garner public support for Brazil\'s, and Lula\'s, 
emerging image as a world leader.  But one aspect of his 
travels may gain heightened press coverage in 2005.  The 
new Presidential aircraft, an Airbus A-391, will likely 
ely 
enter service in February.  Over the next few months, 
Brazilian pundits may enjoy citing the number 
56,713,976.00, the cost in dollars of the new aircraft.

REFORMS 
 
REF: 04 BRASILIA 1076 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Brazil\'s justice system does not enjoy the 
confidence of society, being widely-perceived as slow, 
inefficient and accessible only to the wealthy and powerful. 
But the failures of the courts are increasingly viewed as an 
impediment to social and economic development.  In December 
2004, Constitutional Amendment 45 --supported by President 
Lula, congressional leaders, and top judges-- became law.  It 
will streamline procedures in the Supreme Court and some 
lower courts, it strengthens human rights protections, 
introduces structural and professional reforms, and --most 
controversially-- it authorizes the creation of oversight 
bodies for judges and prosecutors.  Perhaps the greatest 
impact will come from the introduction of the principle of 
judicial precedent for the first time in Brazil (a civil code 
country).  A second bill to amend the Constitution and follow 
up on Amendment 45 is expected to pass in early 2005, and a 
third tranche of reform bills is not far behind.  These three 
measures are detailed below.  It is far too early to tell if 
the reforms will move the Brazilian judiciary towards 
efficiency, impartiality, and transparency, but judging by 
the political and public pressure, great attention will 
accompany them as they are put into practice.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TARNISHED REPUTATION 
-------------------- 
2. (SBU) A November 2003 survey by the Brazilian Bar 
Association found that the Brazilian judiciary is among the 
least trusted of the country\'s institutions: only 39% of 
respondents have confidence in the courts (by contrast, the 
press got 60% and Congress 34%).  Some 74% of respondents 
said they fully or partly agree with the common saying, 
\"There is no justice for the poor, the black, or the 
prostitute\".  One need only read the headlines to see why: 
high profile cases charging judges with corruption and 
influence peddling are common, and impunity seems widespread. 
 At the end of 2004, some 115 senior judges throughout the 
country were under investigation.  But the problem goes 
beyond corruption.  For years, Brazilian judges have been 
notoriously resistant to reform, criticism, and oversight, 
leading one government official to dub them the \"black-robed 
mafia\".  Judges are frequently in the press criticizing 
government policy, requesting raises, or avoiding jail. 
 
JUDGE JOBIM\'S REFORM AGENDA 
--------------------------- 
3. (SBU) The public\'s perception is colored by the slowness 
of the legal system, caused less by  incompetence than by 
suffocating bureaucracy and outdated procedures.  A 2004 
study ordered by Judge Nelson Jobim, Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Federal Court (STF), found that at the end of 2003 
six million cases were in the federal courts alone (the 
volume in the state courts is five times greater), including 
2.7 million in the 3rd Federal District that includes Sao 
Paulo state.  The \"congestion rate\" in the federal courts was 
84%, meaning that for every 100 cases that entered the courts 
in 2003, whether newly-presented or carried over from the 
previous year, only 16 reached a resolution.  Judge Jobim 
took over as Brazil\'s highest judge in May 2004, replacing a 
bitterly anti-reform predecessor (ref A), and he has 
consulted closely with Congress and the administration as the 
various reform bills have been drafted and debated.  Jobim 
has criticized Brazil\'s law schools for turning out 
\"philosopher judges\" incapable of managing their courts 
efficiently, and he points out that the judiciary\'s legendary 
slowness has created a parallel gray-market justice system 
where parties may agree to settle for a fraction of damages 
rather than spend years tied up in various courts to reach an 
unpredictable conclusion.  For investors, foreign and 
domestic, the uncertainties created by this lack of 
transparency and predictability contribute greatly to the 
cost of doing business in Brazil.  The economic effects of 
this system are insidious, contributing, for example, to 
notoriously high loan spreads that Brazilian banks charge in 
order to cover the risk that courts will not enforce 
collection efforts. 
 
4. (U) A 2004 World Bank study using data from 2000 showed 
that (taking into account differences in purchasing power) 
Brazil\'s judicial system is the world\'s second most expensive 
(trailing only Italy) at US$33 per citizen per year, and that 
Brazilian judges are the second highest-paid in the world, 
trailing only the Canadians (U.S. judges are third).  The 
study also shows that as a percentage of government spending, 
Brazil\'s judiciary is the world\'s costliest at 3.66% of the 
total public budget. 
 
REFORMS -- TWELVE YEARS TO PASSAGE 
---------------------------------- 
5. (U) Soon after its passage in 1988, it became clear that 
Brazil\'s Constitution needed to be amended in order to 
modernize a lethargic and insular judiciary that had been 
left essentially unchanged for decades.  In 1992, a bill to 
amend the Constitution was introduced in the Chamber of 
Deputies, where it wallowed in various committees before 
finally passing a floor vote in 2000 and going to the upper 
house.  Its passage in the Senate was nearly as languid, and 
when it reached the floor in early 2003, President Lula da 
Silva, newly-elected and with his own reform ideas, sent it 
back to committee for changes.  In early 2004, a logjam broke 
as the Chief Justices of the two highest courts (STF and 
STJ), both of whom were bitterly opposed to the reforms, were 
coincidentally replaced by pro-reform Chief Justices.  On 8 
December 2004, the Senate formally approved two bills:  one 
with all the measures already approved in the Chamber that 
came into force immediately as Amendment 45 to the 
Constitution; and a second that includes new elements and 
must go back for a final Chamber vote in 2005. 
 
 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 45 
--------------------------- 
6. (U) Amendment 45 is now in force.  It includes reforms of 
the overburdened Supreme Court and certain lower courts.  It 
strengthens human rights protections and introduces 
structural and professional reforms, and --most 
controversially-- it authorizes the creation of oversight 
councils for judges and prosecutors.  Among its measures: 
 
SUPREME COURT REFORMS: 
- Limited Binding Precedent (\"sumula vinculante\").  Brazil 
has never used a precedent system, so its courts decide the 
same legal issues over and over, making the administration of 
justice both inefficient and unpredictable.  Chief Justice 
Jobim of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) once noted that this 
caused the high court to AVERAGE 85 decisions per day. 
Henceforth, STF decisions approved by at least eight of the 
11 justices must be followed by lower courts.  A study by the 
Getulio Vargas Foundation showed that in 2003, 17.3 million 
cases entered the judicial system (federal and state), 
meaning that each of Brazil\'s 13,000 judges averaged 1,300 
cases that year.  In the lower courts, some judges issue 300 
decisions per month.  These numbers could be significantly 
reduced as the precedent system take effect. 
 
- Supreme Court Discretion.  The STF must, by law, hear a 
wide range of cases, overwhelming its docket with procedural 
rulings.  Under the reform, the STF is accorded greater 
discretion to refuse to hear certain cases that lack \"general 
significance\". 
 
 
OTHER COURT REFORMS: 
- Special Land Courts.  Each court must create a special 
panel to hear land disputes. 
 
- Labor Courts.  The Superior Labor Court (TST) will gain ten 
new judges, for a total of 27.  At the lower level, if a 
locality does not have a Labor Judge, then an ordinary judge 
will be allowed to hear labor cases. 
 
- Circuit Riders.  Establishes circuit judges to address the 
grave problem of localities that go years without a judge. 
 
 
HUMAN RIGHTS REFORMS: 
- Federalization.  The Federal Prosecutor can step in and 
take over human rights cases from the states.   This is 
designed to overcome the not infrequent conflicts created 
when human rights violators are important local-level figures. 
 
- Treaties.  International human rights accords will have the 
weight of \"constitutional law\".  Amendment 45 also states 
that Brazil \"submits itself to the International Criminal 
Court, whose creation it supported\". 
 
 
STRUCTURAL REFORMS: 
- \"Ombudsmen\".  Each court will establish an independent 
ombuds office to hear complaints. 
 
- Procedural Rapidity.  Blocks promotion of judges who fail 
to decide cases in a timely manner. 
 
- Independent State Public Defenders.  State public defenders 
will have their own budgets and administrative autonomy.  In 
the past they were dependent on the state judiciary for 
resources and oversight, creating conflicts of interest. 
 
 
PROFESSIONAL REFORMS: 
- \"Professional Quarantine\".  Former judges and prosecutors 
are prohibited for three years from acting as lawyers in the 
courts where they previously worked. 
 
- Career Reforms.  Promotion decisions for judges and 
prosecutors will take into account their productivity.  At 
least three years\' prior legal experience will be required of 
new judges. 
 
- \"Collective Leave\".  Courts must begin working as soon as 
the official recesses are over, ending the practice of the 
entire court taking personal leave to extend the recess. 
 
 
OVERSIGHT COUNCILS: 
- Within six months, two national-level oversight councils 
will be established over judges and prosecutors.  These 
so-called \"external controls\" were bitterly opposed by many 
of those affected and their professional associations.  The 
new National Justice Council (CNJ) will hear complaints and 
apply sanctions against judges and court employees.  It will 
have 15 members: 11 judges and prosecutors, two lawyers, and 
two members named by Congress.  The similar National 
Prosecutors\' Council (CNMP) will be a 14-member body with 
oversight over federal and state prosecutors. 
 
 
SECOND BILL TO BE APPROVED BY CHAMBER IN 2005 
-------------------------------------------- 
7. (U)  A second set of reforms --also enshrined in a bill to 
amend the constitution-- passed the Senate in December and 
now goes back to the Chamber for a final vote.  It will 
follow up on Amendment 45 and is expected to become law in 
the first half of 2005.  It includes: 
 
- Blocking Appeals.  A sort of reverse precedent mechanism to 
combat wasteful appeals and to complement the precedent 
authority given to the STF in Amendment 45.  If lower courts 
issue rulings that coincide with prior decisions by the 
second and third highest courts --the Supreme Justice (STJ) 
and Superior Labor (TST) courts-- and if those higher court 
decisions are by two-thirds\' majorities, then appeals are 
prohibited. 
 
- Independent Federal Public Defenders.  Comparable to the 
autonomy given to state defenders in Amendment 45. 
 
- Arbitration.  Brazil has few mechanisms for alternative 
dispute resolution (ADR).  The bill will allow parties to 
submit cases to an arbiter for a speedier decision.  It also 
creates new types of ADR including conciliation, mediation, 
and non-judicial arbitration. 
 
- Privileged Forum.  Currently, elected officials and cabinet 
members have the right to a \"privileged forum\", i.e., charges 
brought against them are heard by a high court rather than a 
common court.  Congress, not surprisingly, wishes to extend 
this benefit to former, as well as current, elected 
officials. 
 
- Nepotism.  Prohibits judges from hiring close relatives to 
positions under their authority. 
 
 
SUB-CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS TO COME LATER 
---------------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) President Lula is already thinking about next steps. 
 On December 15, even as they celebrated the passage of 
Amendment 45, the heads of the three branches of government 
discussed so-called \"infra-constitutional\" (or 
\"sub-constitutional\") reforms.  This is a package of 23 bills 
--some new and some that have sat unmolested in Congress for 
years-- that the administration hopes to pass in the next 
year.  It is designed to increase efficiencies through 
changes in civil, penal, and labor law procedures.  It 
includes greater use of the principle of binding precedent, 
limitations on wasteful appeals, stricter adherence to court 
deadlines, and simplification of some family law procedures. 
Chief Justice Jobim is hopeful that the bills can be passed 
in early 2005, promising that \"if that happens, by the end of 
the year some results will already begin to be felt\". 
 
 
COMMENT - A LOT OF EYES ARE WATCHING 
------------------------------------ 
9. (SBU)  It is far too early to tell if these reforms will 
have the desired effect, but judging by the ambition 
reflected in their broad scope, by the solid support from 
President Lula, Congressional leaders, and key judges, and by 
the sense that Brazil\'s ossified judiciary has become a 
serious impediment to social and economic growth, there is 
reason to be encouraged that the reforms are at least a good 
first step.  But there remain resolutely anti-reformist 
pockets in the judiciary and others whose interests are 
threatened by a modern judicial system.  President Lula told 
the press in December that, \"Society demands rapid, 
accessible, and adequate justice.  The broad constitutional 
reform that finally passed is a necessary condition for this 
to take place.  But it won\'t work on its own.  Now we need to 
put into practice the advances made in the reforms\". 
Brazil\'s books are full of unenforced laws, but a combination 
of political pressure and support from the business community 
and the public suggest that many eyes are watching to see how 
these reforms are implemented --and to ensure that the 
judiciary becomes part of Brazil\'s solution rather than part 
of the problem.

1.  (U) This cable reflects input from Consulates General 
Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. 
 
2. (SBU) SUMMARY.  The GoB took a long-awaited first step 
towards implementing its new energy regulatory model with a 
December 7 auction of electricity supply futures.  The 
Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) trumpeted the auction as 
an unqualified success, but analysts, investors and 
regulators have criticized both the conduct and results of 
the auction, which resulted in unexpectedly low energy 
prices.  While some observers see the results simply as a 
function of current excess supply and other market factors, 
many analysts are concerned that the low prices will 
decapitalize existing power producers and fail to generate 
sufficient investments to match future energy needs. 
Although the auction was the first real test of the GoB\'s 
new energy regime (reftels), additional auctions to be held 
in early 2005 should more clearly indicate the new model\'s 
fate.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND: FINALLY A NEW ENERGY MODEL 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Since 1995, GoB energy policy has acknowledged the 
need for reliance, to some degree, on market forces and 
private sector involvement, including some privatization of 
the sector.  Upon taking office in 2002, however, the Lula 
administration was determined to establish a new model for 
the sector (reftels).  While the Lula administration did 
not want to pursue further privatization of existing power 
companies, which are primarily parastatal, it recognized 
that it still needed to bring in new private investment 
into the sector.  The result was a new hybrid model, 
enacted in March 2004, designed to stabilize the energy 
sector by increasing state control while maintaining 
aspects of market competition. 
 
4. (U) To account for the differences in cost structures 
among older, already-amortized power plants and new 
investment, the complicated new model divides power 
generators into two competition groups: \"old energy\" 
(generators that came on-line before January 1, 2000) and 
\"new energy\" (future generators and those that came on-line 
after January 1, 2000).  (Note: existing generators whose 
projects came on-line after the cut-off date for \"old 
energy\" are sometimes referred to as \"Energia de Botox\" - 
i.e., old energy, but with a new face.  End Note.) 
 
THE FIRST TEST OF THE NEW MODEL 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The December 7 \"old energy mega-auction,\" run by the 
newly-created Electrical Energy Commercialization Chamber 
(CCEE), was widely seen as the first real test of the new 
GoB energy model.  The 17,000-megawatt auction was for the 
\"captive\" consumers -- primarily households and small 
businesses -- who represent a little over 60% of current 
power demand, and who purchase energy through the large 
distributors.  (Note: Large industrial and commercial power 
consumers may negotiate power-supply contracts directly 
with the energy producers, including some private companies 
who did not sell their energy at the auction, through the 
Free Contract Market (ACL).  End Note.) 
 
6. (U) Brazilian Minister of Mines and Energy Dilma 
Rousseff publicly called the auction a \"success,\" and 
declared it would bring stability to the energy sector 
through longer-term contracts and lower consumer prices. 
The national average price for energy at the time of the 
auction was R$61/MWh.  For the 8-year contracts auctioned, 
the average results were as follows: 
 
     Year        Price        %-of-Demand Contracted 
     ----      --------       ---------------------- 
     2005     R$57.51/MWh          98.9% 
     2006     R$67.33/MWH          91.7% 
     2007     R$75.46/MWh          100% 
 
7. (U) Although there is currently a surplus of energy -- 
in part because recent rains have replenished the country\'s 
hydro reservoirs -- the auction resulted in even lower 
prices than either analysts or the GoB expected.  Investors 
and analysts responded negatively immediately after the 
auction and stock prices for many energy companies plunged; 
in the three days after the auction, the stock of 
Eletrobras (a parastatal and also the country\'s largest 
electricity generator) fell 21.5% and the electric power 
index on the Bovespa stock exchange fell 7.9%.  Many 
analysts expressed concern that the prices were too low for 
the state-owned companies to invest in future generating 
capacity and that the low prices would not attract private 
sector investment.  Other analysts believe, however, that 
the Bovespa\'s quick return to pre-auction levels indicates 
that the market initially over-reacted to the results. 
They note that the prices were still substantially higher 
than the current spot price (Reais 18.59), and that, when 
adjusted for inflation, 2007 prices approach the lower 
bounds of the system\'s marginal cost of expansion (at 
current exchange rates). 
 
TWEAKING THE AUCTION RULES 
-------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) One of the Directors of ANEEL (the Brazilian 
Electricity Regulatory Agency), Isaac Averbuch, told 
Brasilia EconOff the low prices were the result of GoB 
rules for the auction.  Averbuch does not consider it to 
have been a true auction since the rules created a 
\"permanent imbalance\" between supply offered by generators 
and demand.  Indeed, by separating the auction of \"old 
energy\" from \"new energy\", the initial auction benefited 
the primarily state-owned companies whose debts were 
amortized and could thus offer lower prices. 
 
9. (U) The state-owned companies also did not face the same 
pressure as private companies in terms of bottom-lines and 
investment returns.  During the auction itself, 6 of the 18 
participating producers reportedly dropped out after the 
first round of bids.  We are not aware of any state-owned 
companies that withdrew from the pool even as the prices 
continued to drop.  To the contrary, Eletrobras 
subsidiaries were reportedly responsible for 65% of the 
energy auctioned.  Although the GoB plays a central role in 
the auction, the distributors ultimately sign contracts 
directly with the generators. 
 
10. (SBU) During the auction, when the prices dropped below 
a certain level, the energy companies participating could 
withdraw their energy offer from the auction.  Under more 
traditional rules, supply would have been below demand, 
forcing the price to rise again until enough power was 
offered to meet the demand.  However, the GoB created a 
mechanism that allowed it to keep forcing prices down. 
According to Averbuch, the GoB could adjust the demand to 
keep demand less than the supply so that prices would 
continue to drop.  The energy demand removed from the 
auction would then be met with power sold on the spot 
market rather than the long-term contract auction. 
PRIVATE SECTOR PERSPECTIVE 
--------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU) U.S.-owned energy firms Duke Energy and AES told 
Sao Paulo EconOff they believe the GoB conducted the 
auction in a manner that favored state-owned generators and 
distributors.  Duke Energy Director for Regulatory Affairs 
Paulo Born lends support to Averbuch\'s assertion of GoB 
manipulation of the auction rules.  Born said that, in the 
second phase of the auction, the GoB lowered forecasted 
demand while state-owned generating firms offered a 
consistent supply.  This resulted in a downward pressure on 
bid prices that private companies found difficult to match. 
(Note: Although it is not clear how much of the energy 
demand was removed from the auction through this method, 
many companies withdrew their energy supplies from the 
auction as the prices dropped and not all of the demand was 
met for contracts beginning in 2005 and 2006. End Note.) 
Born described the auction as a GoB play for political 
advantage and \"popular support\" by holding energy prices 
down.  AES Vice President for Business Development Ricardo 
Lima told us that, although the auction resulted in lower 
than anticipated prices, the outlook for energy 
distributors has improved, citing guarantees provided for 
distribution companies under the new energy model.  He said 
the prospects for energy generation firms were still 
worrisome, and that it will likely be several years before 
the country will be able to attract new investment. 
 
SHORT-TERM VS. MID-TERM PROGNOSIS 
----------------------------------- 
 
12. (SBU) The Minister of Mines and Energy has publicly 
stated that the auction results will mean lower prices for 
the consumer.  Many reporters have repeated the same 
prediction, at least for the short-term.  Lima from AES 
predicts that prices may drop 2.5%.  Averbuch, however, 
says the prices will probably not go down so much as they 
may just not rise as quickly. 
 
13. (SBU) Averbuch, Born, Lima and other energy analysts 
predict that Brazil faces a possible shortage of energy in 
the short-term (2008-2009) similar to the crisis the 
country suffered in 2001.  This may be the case given the 
approximately 4 years a new hydroelectric plant -- the 
GoB\'s preferred type of power plant -- takes to progress 
from concession to operation, especially if a future 
drought leads to water shortages at the main reservoirs. 
The GoB did not solicit bids for the construction of new 
power plants during 2003 and 2004, and the press reports 
that of the 45 hydroelectric plant concessions auctioned 
between 1997 - 2002, only 21 have begun construction.  Many 
projects are delayed because of environmental licensing 
problems.  While a new thermal power plant can be built in 
2 to 3 years, the GoB policy views thermal power primarily 
as emergency back-up. 
 
14. (SBU) In the medium-term (2010-2012), however, Averbuch 
predicts precisely the opposite problem, because in the new 
model the GoB has reserved for itself the role of 
predicting how much new generation capacity is needed. 
These predictions will be made by a newly formed and 
purportedly independent Energy Research Enterprise (EPE). 
The GoB plans to auction concessions for new power plants 
to supply energy based on the EPE energy consumption 
projections.  Averbuch fears that because the GoB will 
likely over-estimate the energy needs based on overly 
optimistic economic growth projections, Brazil may have an 
energy surplus by 2010 that will lead to a ballooning bill 
for contracted energy. 
 
UPCOMING \"NEW ENERGY\" AUCTION 
------------------------------ 
 
15. (U) Although there is considerable concern over the 
results of the December auction, investors are watching the 
upcoming auction of \"new energy\" even more closely.  The 
\"new energy\" auction is expected in March or April for 
contracts beginning in 2008 and 2009, and the GoB will 
conduct up to four additional auctions during 2005 for 
contracts to supply estimated new future demand.  Wary of 
the timeframe to bring new generation capacity on-line, in 
the new auction the GoB will only solicit bids from 
companies with already-approved environmental licenses. 
However, according to news sources, even among companies 
with approved licenses, such as Tractebel, the decision 
whether to construct the new plants is pending the results 
of the next auction. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16. (SBU) While the results of the December \"old energy\" 
auction were less than encouraging, existing generators had 
little option but to minimize their losses and make their 
peace with the new model.  Beyond the lower than expected 
prices, of perhaps greater concern is the apparent GoB 
manipulation of the auction rules and the influence of the 
large, state-owned energy producers.  That said, the 
outlook for private investment hinges more on the results 
of the \"new energy\" auction, which should show starkly how 
much confidence private investors have in the new model.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  By staying in session through Christmas, 
the Brazilian Congress finally passed the 2005 budget and 
went into recess until February.  The budget process has 
become dysfunctional and this year\'s experience may have 
generated enough frustration to reform it before the next 
cycle.  Overall, Congress had a subpar 2004, although an 
end-of-year bustle saw a few important bills (Judicial 
Reform, a Bankruptcy Law, and Public-Private Partnerships) 
pass into law.  Several other key bills were left hanging 
fire including biotechnology, regulatory agencies, and the 
final pieces of the 2003 tax and pension reforms.  President 
Lula is likely to shuffle his cabinet in January, reflecting 
changes in the governing coalition and its dynamic in 
Congress.  When Congress returns to work, it will select a 
new slate of leaders in both houses and all the committees. 
So, like last year, 2005 will begin with an overflowing 
policy agenda.  The question is whether, like last year, 2005 
will end with that agenda largely unrealized.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BUDGET BILL MARKS END OF SESSION 
-------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) On December 29, after several brutal weeks of 
negotiations and two weeks after the scheduled adjournment 
date, the Brazilian Congress passed the 2005 budget and went 
into recess until February 15.  The procedure was so trying 
that it sparked calls for a reform of the whole budget 
process before next year\'s cycle.  Post will report septel on 
the fiscal implications, but politically the budget process 
is increasingly dysfunctional and divorced from the realities 
of GoB revenues and expenditures.  The problems are manifold: 
hundreds of pork amendments, secret side deals, and Members 
resorting to extortion to force through amendments by 
threatening quorum calls in the half-empty holiday-period of 
Congress.  In the end, in order to keep the ledgers balanced 
while accommodating big-ticket administration items such as a 
minimum wage increase and huge transfer payments to the 
states, Congressional numbers\' crunchers made unrealistically 
rosy assumptions about next year\'s growth and revenue 
figures.  Since the Congressional budget bill only authorizes 
--but does not mandate-- GoB expenditures, President Lula is 
likely to do what he has done in the past: spend far less 
than Congress authorized. 
 
BUSY DECEMBER 
------------- 
3. (SBU)  Congress had a subpar 2004, failing to make much 
progress on key bills and wasting inordinate time in partisan 
fighting before leaving Brasilia in mid-year to stump for 
candidates in the October municipal elections (ref A).  Not 
until December did key bills finally pass into law: 
 
- On December 2, the new Innovation Law came into force, 
creating a new agency to stimulate industrial and scientific 
research (septel). 
 
- On December 8, Congress approved a Constitutional Amendment 
of important judicial reforms (ref B) that streamlines the 
overburdened Supreme Court, strengthens human rights 
protections, and introduces structural reforms and oversight 
to the courts. 
 
- On December 14, after 11 years in committee, the Bankruptcy 
Law passed.  It should bring greater predictability to 
creditors and investors, improve the likelihood that failing 
companies can be restructured, and strengthen the position of 
banks on the list of creditors (ref C). 
 
- On December 22, Congress approved Public-Private 
Partnerships, designed to fund large infrastructure projects 
with a combination of government and private money (ref D). 
The bill is close to the heart of President Lula, who 
believes it will promote his development agenda for the 
coming years.  The administration has drawn up a list of 23 
priority projects --mostly roads, railroads and ports. 
 
2005 CONGRESS WILL HAVE A NEW LOOK 
---------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) In December, two parties in President Lula\'s 
coalition, the PMDB and PPS, fractured between pro-government 
and opposition factions (refs E,F).  These events are still 
playing out and will be affected by Lula\'s cabinet shuffle, 
projected for late-January.  Lula is likely to woo large 
wings of these parties to remain in his camp, and to secure 
their loyalty with cabinet slots and other favors.  His 
decisions will then be reflected in the new Congressional 
lineup.  In February, Congress will select new leaders in 
both houses and in all committees.  The new Senate President 
is likely to be Sen. Renan Calheiros (PMDB), a Lula ally, 
while the front-runner for Chamber President is Dep. Luiz 
Eduardo Greenhalgh (of Lula\'s PT).  The situation is too 
fluid to submit to firm predictions, but the early math 
suggests that the administration will be able to put together 
narrow majorities in both houses on most votes. 
 
FULL LEGISLATIVE PLATE FOR 2005 
------------------------------- 
5. (SBU) The new Congressional leaders will face a dozen key 
bills when they open the new session on February 15, many of 
which are at the heart of the administration\'s agenda. 
Unlike 2004, this year will not have any national elections 
to empty Congress for months on end, but it will see 
increased partisan jockeying in advance of the 2006 national 
elections.  Last month\'s defections by the PMDB and PPS were 
but a prelude to these maneuvers.  High on the 2005 
legislative agenda are: 
 
- Final pieces of the 2003 tax reform.  The most important is 
unification of the state ICMS tax rates to put an end to the 
states\' fiscal wars in search of investments.  If this passes 
in 2005, the administration may push for a VAT in coming 
years to unify the federal IPI, the municipal ISS and the 
state ICMS taxes. 
 
- Final piece of the pension reforms.  Not necessarily an 
administration priority, but it was part of the deal that 
resulted in the passage of the 2003 public sector pension 
reforms.  Now awaiting a Chamber floor vote. 
 
- Biosafety law.  A bill to regulate biotechnology crops and 
stem cell research has been in Congress for over a year (ref 
G).  The latest iteration, more pro-biotech than previous 
versions, is now awaiting a final vote in the Chamber and 
could pass in early 2005. 
 
- Further judicial reforms.  The Constitutional Amendment 
that passed in December 2004 was only the first of three 
judicial reform packages, with two more slated for 2005 (ref 
B). 
 
- Regulatory agencies.  A bill long awaited by investors to 
establish operating rules for agencies regulating 
telecommunications, energy, petroleum, transportation, and 
water. 
 
- Central Bank autonomy.  In May 2003, in the first 
legislative win of Lula\'s administration, Congress passed 
Constitutional Amendment 40 that set the stage for a more 
autonomous Central Bank.  Now Finance Minister Palocci is 
pushing for the necessary follow-on legislation that would 
give Central Bank Directors fixed terms in office and 
formalize what is currently only de facto independence on 
interest rates. 
 
- Political reform.  Lula has said that strengthening the 
electoral process and political parties is a priority (ref 
H), so he may push bills that are now in committee dealing 
with coalitions, campaign financing, and party registration. 
 
- Union and labor reforms, to modernize Brazil\'s rigid and 
obsolete laws.  The administration had hoped to start 
reforming the rules governing union activities, and then take 
on the tougher and broader labor laws.  Of the major reforms, 
these are the least likely to pass in 2005. 
 
- Abortion.  The Supreme Court is considering a case that 
would create just the third exception to the abortion ban 
(allowing abortions in cases of fetal anencephaly, ref I). 
The existing two exceptions are cases of rape and danger to 
the life of the mother.  But there are now calls for Congress 
to assertively legislate the issue rather than leave it to 
the courts. 
 
- Budget process.  As noted above, a reform of the unwieldy 
budget process has now become a possibility.  Although no 
bill has been drafted, a bicameral working group is expected 
to start work in February to fast-track this reform. 
 
COMMENT - 2005 OR BUST 
---------------------- 
6. (SBU) As in the U.S., Brazil\'s political system is most 
likely to yield legislative results in odd-numbered years 
because they provide some insulation from election campaigns. 
 In 2003 Lula passed significant reforms, but 2004 was dead 
time in Congress until after the October elections.  With a 
new cabinet and new congressional leadership in place by 
mid-February, Congress will open its 2005 session as 
well-positioned as ever to make progress on the raft of bills 
awaiting its attention.  When the 2005 session ends, all eyes 
will turn to the October 2006 (presidential, congressional, 
and gubernatorial) elections, meaning that partisan jockeying 
will make it difficult to pass any tough bills in 2006.  2005 
is a now-or-never year for Lula\'s first-term agenda.

STRATEGY REPORT (INCSR) 
 
REF:  STATE 248987 
 
1.  Following is Brazil\'s 2004-2005 INCSR. As requested in 
reftel, the money laundering portion of the INCSR will be 
submitted separately. 
 
BRAZIL 
 
---------- 
I. SUMMARY 
---------- 
2.   The principal event of 2004 in Brazil\'s anti-narcotics 
effort was the long awaited implementation of a shoot down 
law that the Brazilian Congress passed years earlier but 
was only put into effect on October 17 after President Lula 
signed the necessary implementing decree.  The GOB adopted 
a new national strategy document for combating money 
laundering.  A principle aim of the 32 goals articulated in 
the strategy document is to better coordinate disparate 
federal and state level anti-money laundering efforts. 
Operation COBRA (Colombia  Brazil) based in Tabatinga, 
Brazil has now been functioning for almost four years and 
is showing positive results.  Similar operations on the 
Venezuelan and Peruvian borders are now up and running. 
 
3.  Brazil is a major transit country for illicit drugs 
shipped to Europe and to a lesser extent, to the United 
States. Brazil continues to cooperate with its South 
American neighbors in an attempt to control the remote and 
expansive border areas where illicit drugs are transported. 
Brazil is a signatory of various counternarcotics 
agreements and treaties, including the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, the 1995 bilateral U.S.-Brazil counternarcotics 
agreement, and the annual Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
with the U.S. 
 
--------------------- 
II. STATUS OF COUNTRY 
--------------------- 
4.  Brazil is a conduit for cocaine base and cocaine HCL 
moving from source countries to Europe and Brazilian urban 
centers, as well as a conduit for smaller amounts of heroin 
moving from source countries to the U.S. and Europe.  Crack 
cocaine is used among youths in the country\'s cities, 
particularly Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.  Brazil is not a 
significant drug-producing country.  Organized drug gangs, 
located principally in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, are 
involved in narcotics related arms trafficking. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
III. COUNTRY ACTIONS AGAINST DRUGS IN 2004 
------------------------------------------ 
 
POLICY INITIATIVES 
 
5.  Brazil has undertaken various bilateral and 
multilateral efforts to meet all objectives of the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention, has implemented adequate legal law 
enforcement measures, and achieved significant progress in 
the fight against illegal drugs. 
 
6.  The GoB adopted at end-2003 a new national strategy 
document for combating money laundering.  A principle aim 
of the 32 goals articulated in the strategy document is to 
better coordinate disparate federal and state level anti- 
money laundering efforts, and to that end a high-level 
coordination council was created, led by the Ministry of 
Justice\'s Office for Asset Seizure and International 
Juridical Cooperation.  The council oversees the financial 
intelligence work of Brazil\'s Council for the Monitoring of 
Financial Activities (COAF), which has been strengthened 
with additional analysts.  In addition to its strategic 
coordination role, the council may assign specific cases to 
law enforcement task forces for investigation. 
 
Implementation of much of the strategy is ongoing, with 
task forces set up to draft legislative changes necessary 
to facilitate law enforcement access to financial 
information during investigations, to refine existing 
legislation to facilitate prosecutions of money laundering 
and terrorism finance cases, as well as to study the 
criminalization of illicit enrichment.  Creation of a 
unified database of all money laundering investigations and 
a national level registry of real estate, steps which would 
aid investigators, is also contemplated. 
 
7.  After a year of intensive negotiations with the USG to 
successfully secure a Presidential Determination addressing 
liability issues under U.S. law, the GOB implemented its 
air bridge denial (\"shootdown\") law on 17 October 2004. 
Brazil\'s law and program permit the Brazilian air force to 
use lethal force interdiction against civil aircraft 
suspected to be engaged in aerial narcotrafficking flights. 
The USG considered that the threat to Brazil\'s national 
security, as well as its operational safety procedures for 
the program, were sufficiently strong to justify the U.S. 
Presidential Determination, which is similar to the 
determination in place for Colombia\'s ABD program. (Under 
certain circumstances, U.S. law criminalizes actions that 
lead to shooting down a civil aircraft, hence a special 
determination from the President based on compelling and 
extraordinary circumstances was required to address U.S. 
legal issues.) The determination is subject to annual 
review and renewal by the USG.  The GOB indicates it has 
seen a substantial decrease in suspect aerial activity 
since the law went into force.  There have been no 
shootdown or warning shot incidents thus far. 
 
8.  Brazil has forged closer ties with its neighbors in the 
war against drugs as a result of the \"joint commission\" 
(CM) the GOB formed in 2003.   The Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry, with representatives from the Federal Police, 
SENAD, SENASP (National Public Safety Secretariat), ANVISA 
(National Agency of Health Monitoring), Health Ministry, 
and ABIN (National Intelligence Agency) make up the CM. 
The CM along with the creation of an intelligence center in 
the Tri-Border area and the various border operations have 
increased cooperation between Brazil and its neighbors. 
 
9.    Brazil\'s Unified Public Safety System (SUSP), which 
was created in 2003, is now fully functional and showing 
results.  SUSP, which is administered by SENASP, is a 
national system to integrate diverse state civil and 
military police forces.  Each state has formulated its own 
public safety plan, in accordance with SENASP\'s national 
plan.  SUSP assists the GOB in ensuring a unified approach 
to law enforcement and statistical crime and narcotics 
seizures reporting. 
 
--------------- 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
--------------- 
 
10.  In 2004, the GOB exercised a regional counternarcotics 
leadership role.  In June \"Operation Seis Fronteiras\" (see 
para 30) was carried out with the intention of disrupting 
the illegal flow of precursor chemicals in the region.  GOB 
continued its support of \"Operation Alliance\" with 
Brazilian and Paraguayan counterdrug interdiction forces in 
the Paraguayan-Brazilian border area.  In August, the GOB 
in partnership with UNODC hosted a seminar on money 
laundering that drew participants from all over Brazil and 
also included the presence of President Lula. 
 
------------------------------ 
ILLICIT CULTIVATION/PRODUCTION 
------------------------------ 
 
11.  With the exception of some cannabis grown primarily 
for domestic consumption in the interior of the northeast 
region, there is no significant evidence of the cultivation 
of illicit drugs in Brazil.  Brazilian Federal Police 
analysts believe that international narcotics trafficking 
organizations could increase numbers of cocaine processing 
laboratories in Brazilian territory however a steady supply 
from Bolivia and to a lesser extent Colombia, have not made 
it necessary. 
 
------------ 
DISTRIBUTION 
------------ 
 
12.  Federal Counternarcotics Police and state authorities 
are investigating the extensive domestic distribution 
networks in major and secondary cities in Brazil. 
----------------------------- 
SALE, TRANSPORT AND FINANCING 
----------------------------- 
13.  The Federal Police took measures to identify 
significant drug trafficking trends, patterns, and 
traffickers throughout Brazil in 2004.  Although one or two 
monthly deliveries of large amounts of Colombian cocaine 
may be shipped to Brazil\'s urban centers of Rio de Janeiro 
and Sao Paulo, Federal Police analysis indicates that 
Bolivian cocaine and Paraguayan marijuana generally tend to 
dominate in those markets. 
 
------------- 
ASSET SEIZURE 
------------- 
14.  Many assets, particularly motor vehicles, are seized 
during narcotics raids and put into immediate use by the 
Federal Police under a March 1999 Executive Decree.  Other 
assets are auctioned and proceeds distributed based on 
court decisions.  Federal Police records show that one 
airplane, 554 motor vehicles, 39 motorcycles, 4 boats, 253 
firearms, and 984 cell phones were seized in 2004. 
 
----------- 
EXTRADITION 
----------- 
 
15.  According to the Brazilian Constitution, no Brazilian 
shall be extradited, except naturalized Brazilians in the 
case of a common crime committed before naturalization, or 
in the case where there is sufficient evidence of 
participation in the illicit traffic of narcotics and 
related drugs, under the terms of the law. Brazil 
cooperates with other countries in the extradition of non- 
Brazilian nationals accused of narcotics-related crimes. 
Brazil and the U.S. are parties to a bilateral extradition 
treaty signed in 1961.  No extraditions were carried out 
during 2004.  There were three extraditions from Brazil to 
the U.S. in 2003, one of which was narcotics-related. 
 
16.  There are no pending narcotics-related extradition 
cases of non-Brazilian citizens.  There are five other 
cases of non-Brazilian citizens (all U.S. citizens) who are 
currently incarcerated in Brazil and are pending 
extradition to the U.S. on financial/white collar (non- 
narcotics) charges.  Two were arrested in 2004 and 2003 and 
one was arrested in 2002. 
 
----------------------- 
MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE 
----------------------- 
 
17.  During 2003, various USG agencies and sections, 
including NAS, State Department Public Diplomacy Section, 
DHS, DEA, FBI, and others have provided training throughout 
Brazil in a wide variety of law enforcement areas, 
including combating money laundering, cyber-crime, 
community policing, port security, crisis management and 
demand reduction programs. 
 
18.   Brazilian Law Enforcement also eagerly accepted 
opportunities to attend training programs in the United 
States.   Money laundering, drug courts, and the F.B.I. 
academy were some of the more notable areas of interest. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TRANSIT COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------- 
 
19.  The DPF, SENAD and SENASP continued to express their 
interest in active cooperation, particularly intelligence 
sharing, and coordination with the U.S. in drug control 
activities. 
 
20.  Brazil cooperates with authorities in neighboring 
countries, particularly Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, to 
enhance regional counternarcotic efforts.  In June 2004, 13 
law enforcement officers attended specialized training in 
Bolivia.  Brazilian authorities maintain good working 
relationships with their neighboring counterparts.  A head 
of the training section of the Brazilian Federal Police 
academy attended a high level planning meeting in Panama 
City for the planned International Law Enforcement Academy 
(ILEA).  In January 2004, a group of 12 Brazilian police 
officers (9 Federal, 2 state military, and one civilian) 
attended the ILEA advanced management course in New Mexico. 
Seven policemen from the state of Minas Gerais participated 
in a community policing exchange in Austin, Texas.  This 
program also gave the same opportunity for police from 
Texas to visit Brazil. 
 
---------------- 
DEMAND REDUCTION 
---------------- 
 
21. The DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance and Education) program 
(known as PROERD in Brazil) is now active in all 26 states 
of Brazil and the Federal District.  Through the Brazilian 
National Public Safety Secretariat (SENASP) and the 
National Antidrug Secretariat (SENAD), NAS assisted in 
financing and logistics, and NAS personnel visited several 
of the training sessions.  Brazil has the largest DARE 
program outside of the U.S.  The DARE program reinforces a 
positive image of local police forces, while providing a 
strong message concerning demand reduction.  NAS, along 
with several NGOs and the U.S. Consulate in Sao Paulo, is 
working to establish the 40 Assets Program in Sao Paulo. 
The program should be functioning by early 2005.  NAS 
provided funding for SENAD and the Ministry of Education to 
provide training to thousands of school teachers nationwide 
via the educational television network.  The programs 
provide the teachers with an anti-drug curriculum.  The 
SENAD toll-free number on drug information is in the 
process of be upgraded to be able to handle more calls and 
provide medical counseling. 
 
----------------------- 
LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS 
----------------------- 
 
22.  In 2004, the Federal Police seized 7.7 metric tons of 
cocaine HCl and 120 kilograms of crack.  Marijuana 
(cannabis) seizures totaled 149.2 metric tons in 2004. 
Three cocaine drug laboratories were dismantled in 2004. 
These numbers are incomplete, since only those of the 
Federal Police, and not those of local police forces, are 
reported on a national basis.  Federal Police sources 
estimate they record perhaps 75 percent of seizures and 
detentions. 
 
---------- 
CORRUPTION 
---------- 
 
23.  As a matter of government policy, Brazil does not 
condone, encourage, or facilitate production, shipment, or 
distribution of illicit drugs or laundering of drug money. 
The Federal Police have carried out a number of high 
profile investigations of public officials and State Police 
involved in money laundering and/or narco-trafficking.  The 
fight against corruption remains a high priority for 
Brazilian law enforcement. 
 
----------------------- 
AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES 
----------------------- 
 
24.  Brazil became a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention 
in 1991.  Bilateral agreements based on the 1988 convention 
form the basis for counternarcotics cooperation between the 
U.S. and Brazil.  Brazil also has a number of narcotics 
control agreements with its South American neighbors, 
several European countries, and South Africa. Brazil 
cooperates bilaterally with other countries and 
participates in the UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) and the 
Organization of American States/Anti-drug Abuse Control 
Commission (OAS/CICAD). 
 
----------------- 
DRUG FLOW/TRANSIT 
----------------- 
 
25.  Marijuana from Paraguay and cocaine from Bolivia are 
smuggled into Brazil across remote border areas and are 
destined primarily for domestic consumption.  Federal 
Police officials indicate that cocaine leaving Colombia and 
entering Brazil by air is destined for international 
markets in Europe hidden in containerized cargo.  Brazil\'s 
recently enacted shootdown law has had an effect on 
clandestine flights.  Sources [and the press] indicate that 
flights are down by 35 percent.  It is too soon to tell 
what real impact the law will have in the long run. 
According to Federal Police, smaller amounts of cocaine 
leave Colombia via Brazil\'s waterway networks in the Amazon 
region and are mainly destined for the Brazilian domestic 
market.  In addition, smaller quantities of heroin have 
been detected moving through Brazil from source countries 
to the U.S. and Europe. 
 
----------------------- 
U.S. POLICY INITIATIVES 
----------------------- 
 
26.  U.S. counternarcotics policy in Brazil focuses on 
liaison with and assistance to Brazilian authorities in 
identifying and dismantling international narcotics 
trafficking organizations, reducing money laundering and 
increasing awareness of the dangers of drug abuse and drug 
trafficking and related issues such as organized crime and 
arms trafficking.  Assisting Brazil to develop a strong 
legal structure for narcotics and money laundering control 
and enhancing cooperation at the policy level are key 
goals.  Bilateral agreements provide for cooperation 
between U.S. agencies, the National Anti-drug Secretariat 
and the Ministry of Justice. 
 
--------------------- 
BILATERAL COOPERATION 
--------------------- 
 
27.  In accordance with the bilateral U.S.-Brazil letter of 
agreement (LOA) on counternarcotics, bilateral programs 
that took place in 2004 included:  cooperation with the 
Regional Intelligence Center of Operation COBRA; expansion 
of COBRA prototype to other areas of the country, a 
country-wide conference on money laundering in Brasilia; 
and a SENAD project that involves a partnership with the 
Ministry of Education to provide long distance drug 
prevention training to over 5,000 teachers nation wide via 
the educational television network.  Brazil and the U.S. 
are seeking to meet all goals set forth in the bilateral 
LOA. 
 
28.  Through the LOA, in 2004, the USG worked closely with 
the Federal Police, SENASP (Brazilian National Public 
Safety Secretariat), and SENAD.  Various operations, such 
as Operation Alianza (Brazil, Paraguay) that involved 
marijuana eradication/interdiction, Operation Six Frontiers 
and a chemical control task force in the port of Santos 
were supported with LOA funds.  With SENASP, the USG worked 
with local state and military police forces throughout 
Brazil to ensure such forces had basic law enforcement 
equipment and training.  The USG worked closely with SENAD 
in 2004 on programs such as DARE, the implementation of a 
nation-wide drug use survey and a toll free counseling 
hotline. 
 
29.  Brazil continues to be actively involved in IDEC. 
Worldwide conferences are held annually, and sub-regional 
conferences are held approximately six months after the 
general conference.  These conferences, sponsored and 
supported by DEA, bring law enforcement leaders from 
Western Hemisphere countries together to discuss the 
counterdrug situations in their respective countries and to 
formulate regional responses to the problems they face. 
Brazil is a member of the Andean and Southern Cone Working 
Groups. 
 
30.  Operation Seis Fronteiras VI is part of a continuing 
regional exercise involving Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and U.S. DEA to concentrate 
antidrug law enforcement efforts in the area of precursor 
chemicals, and has been successful. 
 
31.  Bilateral cooperation between the USG/NAS and Brazil 
has never been better.  A number of conferences exchange, 
training programs and seminars took place during the last 
year.  Brazilian Federal and State Police were sent for 
training to the United States on various occasions. 
Representatives from U.S. Agencies such as DEA, DHS, FBI, 
U.S. Coast Guard among others came to Brazil to train anti- 
drug units and give presentations at conferences.  This 
relationship is expected to expand during the coming year 
due to the excellent relationship between the two countries 
and an increase in funding under the LOA. 
 
-------------- 
THE ROAD AHEAD 
-------------- 
 
32.  The biggest challenge for Brazil in the war against 
narcotrafficking is to secure its frontiers by increasing 
interdiction efforts against criminal organizations that 
are able to exploit a vast border area to smuggle their 
goods.  Fully functional border operations like COBRA 
(Colombia) located in northern Brazil and others still in 
their initial start-up phase such as; Vebra (Venezuela), 
PEBRA (Peru), and BRABO (Bolivia) are one of the keys to 
obtaining this goal.  The planned opening of a joint 
intelligence center in early 2005 in the southern Tri- 
Border area will be a step forward in the fight against 
narcotrafficking and other illegal activities in the 
region.  The center will include representatives from 
Argentina and Paraguay thus ensuring better cooperation 
among the three countries.  Another crucial development 
last year was the implementation of Brazil\'s shootdown law. 
This law should assist in reducing the number of illegal 
flights over the country\'s expansive borders.

-------------------------- 
PRECURSOR CHEMICAL CONTROL 
-------------------------- 
 
34.  Brazil requires registration with Federal Narcotics 
Police for all production, transport and distribution of 
precursor chemicals. In August 2003, the GOB Justice 
Ministry issued a regulation to prevent the manufacture of 
illegal drugs, which requires the control, and inspection 
of approximately 150 chemical substances.  Any person or 
company that is involved in the purchase, transportation, 
or use of these products must have a Certificate of 
Approval of Operation, real estate registry, certificate, 
or special license. These documents must be issued by the 
Federal Police. 
 
35.  The Federal Police have organized precursor chemical 
training and initiated interdiction operations of chemical 
precursors, including cyclical audits and investigations of 
Brazilian chemical firms.  Brazil is compliant with the 
agreements to establish a method for maintaining records of 
transactions of the established list of precursor and 
essential chemicals and has established procedures under 
which such records can be made available to other 
countries\' law enforcement authorities.

REF: 04 STATE 269653 
 
1.  (SBU)  Poloff delivered talking points to Ministry of 
External Relations, Transnational Crimes Office Chief Marcus 
Pinta Gama.  According to Pinta Gama, the GOB hopes to ratify 
the last three outstanding international counterterrorism 
accords this year.  Of the three, the most urgent 
ratification, he explained, was the Convention for the 
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.  Although a 2004 
Congressional hearing on the Convention was postponed, 
following his own discussions with key Deputados, Pinta Gama 
believed Congressional passage was feasible during the \"first 
semester\" of 2005. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Regarding the Safety of Maritime Navigation 
Convention and the Protocol on Fixed Platforms, Pinta Gama 
noted that the GOB did not intend to push these two through 
Congress as strongly as the Terrorism Financing Convention. 
However, he felt that both could be ratified by the second 
half of 2005. 
 
3.  (SBU)  In Pinta Gama\'s view, the most critical 
legislative step Brazil needed to take on the topic of 
terrorism was revision of Brazil\'s military regime era 
National Security Law.  While the 1978 law provided the tools 
to punish terrorists and terrorist financiers, Pinta Gama was 
uncertain Brazilian judges would allow the law, if put to the 
test, to be applied since it preceded Brazil\'s 1988 
Constitution.  A Working Group, he added, had been proposed 
to develop a national policy and structure for more effective 
counterterrorism, including review of existing legislation. 
The new legislation, as Pinta Gama perceived it, thus could 
be crafted to be in conformity with the Inter-American 
Convention against Terrorism.

REF: 04 SECSTATE 264222 
 
1. In a January 5 meeting, EconOffs made reftel points to 
Luis Fernando Serra and Bruno Carvalho Ramos of ANATEL 
(Brazil\'s Telecommunications Regulatory Agency and the 
entity here responsible for ITU issues).  Serra is the Head 
of the Office of International Affairs and a career 
diplomat.  Ramos, an engineer by profession, is the Mobile 
Communications Standards Manager and ANATEL\'s lead on ITU. 
Serra and Ramos said the GoB had supported the USG during 
the November 2004 World Telecommunications Standardization 
Assembly (WTSA) in Florianopolis and continues to be 
aligned with the USG on the veto issue.  Although ANATEL 
was disappointed with the results, Ramos saw little ground 
to overturn the decision, since, in his assessment, the 
Assembly has the authority to make this type of decision. 
Whether or not the decision could be reviewed by the 
Telecommunication Standardization Advisory Group (TSAG) or 
the ITU Counsel was a matter that would require study. 
ANATEL did not think the change would have any real impact 
on the day-to-day work of the ITU, but would be concerned 
if it was applied in some other way.  Ramos and Serra 
nevertheless expressed support for USG plans to raise the 
veto issue at both the TSAG meeting in March 2005 and the 
ITU Counsel meeting in July 2005.  Serra and Ramos further 
suggested that the USG initiate a discussion with the 
Executive Committee of the Inter-American Telecommunication 
Commission (CITEL) so that a consensus position or proposal 
could be moved forward. 
 
2. In an aside, Ramos told EconOffs the GoB considered the 
Florianopolis WTSA a success, especially in comparison with 
the 2002 meeting in Morocco, although more concrete 
progress could have been made.

TO VISIT BRASILIA FOR DISCUSSIONS ON ISSUES RELATED TO 
MEDICAL RESEARCH PROJECTS 
 
REF:  EMAIL 12/17/2005 TO KEVIN BIALY 
 
---------- 
Summary: 
---------- 
1.  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry has extended an 
invitation to Kevin Bialy (and other NIH representatives if 
desired) to visit Brasilia after January 15, 2005, for face- 
to-face discussions related to NIH medical research 
projects.  The topics mentioned by the Brazilians were 
discussion of a speedier system for processing the grants 
and a way for the Brazilian government to know that the 
recommendations that accompany their letters of grant 
acceptance were being considered. Embassy encourages 
acceptance of the invitation, and would hope a visit could 
be scheduled in January 2005.  End summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2.  In November 2004, Brazil\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
communicated with Embassy Brasilia regarding the possibility 
of holding discussions with NIH on above-mentioned issues. 
Embassy Brasilia supported this initiative because, as you 
know, recent letters of grant acceptance from the Ministry 
to NIH contained \"recommendations\" that NIH adhere to 
provisions of Brazilian law pertaining to rules on research 
involving human subjects. In an effort to ensure that NIH 
was aware of all Brazilian rules and regulations in this 
area, Embassy requested and received a copy of Brazilian 
Ministry of Health publication \"Rules on Research Involving 
Human Subjects\" (English) and forwarded it via FEDEX to 
Kevin Bialy. 
 
---------- 
Meeting To Clarify Issues 
---------- 
 
3.  In subsequent discussions with Minister Counselor 
Vergniaud Elyseu Filho, Chief of the Division of Science and 
Technology at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Embassy 
related its desire to have a clearer understanding of the 
\"recommendations\" included in the grant acceptance letters. 
Elyseu Filho explained that recommendations in the 
acceptance letters are generated either by the Ministry of 
Health or the National Commission for Ethics in Research. 
He expressed a willingness to invite representatives from 
each of these entities to the meeting to clarify this 
process and other issues. 
 
4.  Embassy strongly supports the Brazilian request for NIH 
to travel to Brasilia, and hopes that it can be scheduled in 
January.  We recommend that because of national holidays, 
you avoid the period February 2-15, as often Ministry 
officials are unavailable. 
 
5.  We view this meeting as an excellent opportunity to 
ensure that NIH has access to all rules and regulations 
governing your activities in Brazil.  It will also provide 
the Brazilians with an opportunity to express to you any 
concerns they may have. 
 
6.  Embassy believes the research funded and conducted in 
Brazil by NIH with its Brazilian partners is an extremely 
positive and important component of our bilateral 
relationship.  Judging from the attitude of those we\'ve 
spoken to at the Ministry, the Brazilians hold this 
partnership in equally high regard. 
 
7.  NIH may reply to this communication either by cable, or 
email to Brasilia Embassy Science Counselor Patricia Norman 
at NormanPD@state.gov Tel: 55 61 312-7401.  Logistical 
details can be worked out after your acceptance has been 
received.

REF:  LIMA 5732 
 
1. (SBU) Summary and introduction.  Diplomatic 
restraint enabled the 27th Mercosul presidential 
summit to conclude on December 17 without incident, 
but widespread dissatisfaction with meager economic 
benefits flowing from the bloc, and bitter trade 
disagreements between Brazil and Argentina clouded the 
event.  Limited trade agreements with India and the 
Southern Africa Customs Union were finalized; new 
associate members Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador 
were welcomed.  However, tough issues on reforming the 
Protocol of Ouro Preto and on eliminating exceptions 
from the Common External Tariff were set aside.  The 
trade initiatives that were announced, such as the 
eventual elimination of double CXT applications, will 
have no immediate impact.  Held in Ouro Preto, Brazil 
to mark the tenth anniversary of the 1994 Protocol of 
Ouro Preto, the GoB had hoped for a strong 
reaffirmation of the Mercosul ideal.  While President 
Lula asserted that Mercosul is a \"destiny,\" the lack 
of political will to remove final impediments to 
formation of a customs union and lingering doubts over 
the pact\'s economic importance continue to cloud 
Mercosul\'s future.  End summary and introduction. 
 
The Return to Ouro Preto 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U) The 27th Mercosul Summit in Ouro Preto, Brazil 
concluded on December 17, 2004 without incident, but 
intra-bloc differences clouded the affair.  The 
meeting marked the 10-year anniversary of the Protocol 
of Ouro Preto, which provided a permanent framework 
for establishment of Mercosul\'s customs union and 
institutions, and the turnover of the 6-month pro 
tempore presidency from Brazil to Paraguay.  President 
Lula was joined by the presidents of Uruguay, 
Paraguay, and Argentina, despite earlier doubts about 
President Kirchner\'s participation following President 
Lula\'s rejection on December 8 of the Argentine demand 
that Mercosul adopt a trade safeguard mechanism.  The 
Presidents of Mercosul Associate Members Chile, 
Bolivia, Peru, and Venezuela also attended, as well as 
the President of Panama, who conveyed an interest in 
his country becoming an Associate Member. 
 
3. (U) As the highlight of Brazil\'s presidency, the 
GoB had hoped the summit would provide a stronger 
reaffirmation of the Mercosul ideal of regional 
integration.  Mercosul has been a top priority for the 
Lula administration and despite frustration in 
Brazil\'s private sector and in some government 
quarters, particularly within the Ministry of 
Development and Trade, the GoB\'s commitment to the 
bloc so far has been unwavering.  President Lula 
presented a stirring defense of Mercosul and suggested 
naysayers were exaggerating its difficulties.  He 
underscored Brazil\'s commitment to the bloc when he 
declared \"Mercosul is more than an option, it is a 
destiny.\" 
 
4. (U) While reiterating the political importance of 
Mercosul, other leaders\' public remarks revealed 
frustration with the bloc\'s inability to move forward 
in a decisive, effective and equitable way to form a 
genuine customs union, let alone the long-term goal of 
a common market.  President Kirchner admitted that the 
regional bloc is essential for Argentina, but warned 
that \"the benefits can\'t be all in one direction,\" in 
a veiled reference to his country\'s trade frictions 
with Brazil (septel).  The economic asymmetries among 
the bloc\'s members and the lack of consistency in 
Mercosul trade policy, including the exceptions- 
riddled Common External Tariff (CXT), were seen as 
continuing concerns.  Former Argentine President 
Duhalde, in his capacity as president of the Mercosul 
Commission of Permanent Representatives, complained 
that only 30 percent of the measures approved by 
Mercosul have been approved by national legislatures. 
 
Timid Advances on Trade and Integration 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Given the strained atmosphere, the GoB\'s 
ambitious agenda for the meeting had to be scrapped. 
Leaders did not discuss changes to the Ouro Preto 
Protocol, despite Brazil\'s preparation of a package of 
reforms, including a proposal to change the Mercosul 
decision-making mechanism from consensus to majority- 
voting.  Other fundamental, yet sensitive issues, such 
as revision of the CXT and the bloc\'s automotive 
policy, were also put aside for the sake of a 
convening a \"successful\" meeting.  The lack of clear 
advances in eliminating exceptions to the CXT raised 
doubts among Brazilian commentators about Mercosul\'s 
ability to establish a customs union in accordance 
with the bloc\'s Objective 2006 program adopted in July 
2003. 
 
6. (U) While Foreign Minister Amorim defended the Ouro 
Preto outcome as marking an important moment in 
\"consolidating Mercosul,\" most summit initiatives have 
been characterized as timid.  For instance, the 
announced regulations for the Government Procurement 
Protocol merely harmonize regulations issued pursuant 
to bilateral agreements that already enable businesses 
in the four countries to compete for government 
procurement contracts at the federal level on an equal 
basis.  Furthermore, the new regulations are not yet 
final, but must be approved by national legislatures. 
Likewise, a fifth round of services negotiations 
resulted only in \"progress\" toward converging norms 
for financial and construction services. 
 
7. (U) During the summit, Paraguay finally relented 
under pressure from Brazil and Uruguay to one of the 
more important initiatives -- to eliminate double 
application of the CXT on goods entering one of the 
member countries for final destination in another. 
However, for the near-term this will have no economic 
effect; set to commence in 2005, the initiative will 
only cover goods whose applied tariff is zero, as an 
MFN rate or through a tariff preference regime.  The 
result is one less bureaucratic process for these 
imports, but status quo for all others. 
 
8. (U) The Mercosul partners committed to formulate by 
2008 a mechanism for the gradual elimination of double 
tariff application on goods with applied tariffs above 
zero.  But whether this effort will come to fruition 
is less than certain given Paraguay\'s sensitivity; 
tariff revenues reportedly account for approximately 
18 percent of that country\'s tax revenue.  Paraguay\'s 
Foreign Minister Rachid was quoted as saying three 
conditions would have to be met before double tariffs 
could be eliminated: 1) creation of a computerized 
customs system for tracking products; 2) establishment 
of a single customs code; and 3) formation of a fund 
to transfer a part of the CXT collected to Paraguay. 
(Note. Elimination of the double duty has been a key 
demand of the European Union in its free trade 
negotiations with the Mercosul.) 
 
9. (U) Finally, leaders announced their intent to 
create a Fund for Structural Convergence, though no 
financing commitments were made.  The fund, slated to 
come into existence in 2006, is supposed to provide 
financing for projects to reduce regional structural 
differences and lift the competitiveness of the 
Uruguayan and Paraguayan economies; a definitive 
proposal for establishment of the Fund isn\'t expected 
until May 2005. 
 
Trade Agreements Inked 
---------------------- 
 
10. (U) Representatives from India and the Southern 
Africa Customs Union (including South Africa\'s Trade 
Minister) were on-hand in Ouro Preto to finalize 
partial trade preference agreements with Mercosul, 
which the Brazilian private sector views as shallow 
accords with little commercial consequence.  The 
agreements aren\'t expected to expand trade 
substantially; the agreement with India covers only 
902 products, about 450 for each side, for which 
tariffs are reduced by 10 to 100 percent, with 20 
percent as the norm.  The agreement with the SACU 
covers 1,907 products (approximately 1,000 for each 
side), with tariff reductions ranging from 20, 50 and 
100 percent.  Nonetheless, Mercosul leaders, 
particularly President Lula, count these as important 
accomplishments and steps in a broader process of 
strengthening economic and political relations with 
these strategically important developing countries. 
 
11. (U) Much ado was also made as Ecuador, Venezuela 
and Colombia joined Bolivia, Chile and Peru as 
Mercosul Associate Members.  Note, associate 
membership only requires signature to Mercosul\'s 
democratic clause and a free trade agreement with the 
bloc; Associate Members may participate in the bloc\'s 
political consultations, but are not required to 
comply with any internal rules or adhere to the bloc\'s 
negotiating positions.  The free trade agreements with 
the Andean community countries were again lauded as 
providing the base for the launch of the South 
American Community of Nations on December 8 in Cuzco, 
Peru (reftel).  However, Bolivia\'s President Mesa 
raised concern about unfocused efforts at regional 
integration, stating that \"we have to be brief and 
eliminate what could be a confusion of roles, a 
repetition of objectives and a duplication of 
efforts.\" 
 
12. (SBU) Perhaps to buoy Mercosul\'s image as a 
dynamic and sought after trade partner, the GoB 
invited a number of diplomatic representatives to the 
Mercosul Council of the Common Market meeting the day 
before the summit.  By and large the invitees 
represented countries that are engaged to some degree 
in trade discussions with Mercosul.  These range from 
discussions to seek closer commercial relations 
generally, to the launching of trade negotiations. 
Representatives from the following countries attended: 
Panama, Mexico, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Guyana, 
Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Suriname, Trinidad and 
Tobago, India, South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, 
Namibia, Swaziland, Canada, Australia, China, Egypt, 
Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Switzerland. 
The EU delegation received a faxed invite four days 
prior, but was unable to send a representative.  (The 
USG did not make the list.  During a December 20 
conversation with Sao Paulo Consul General, Sao Paulo 
Federal Deputy Joao Herrmann, a member of the Foreign 
Relations Committee, lamented the USG absence in Ouro 
Preto, suggesting that it demonstrated the failure of 
both sides to place appropriate emphasis on the 
bilateral trade relationship.) 
 
On the Political Side... 
------------------------ 
 
13. (U) In keeping with recent efforts to expand 
Mercosul\'s political dimensions, leaders directed the 
Mercosul Joint Parliamentary Commission to formulate 
procedures for the installation of a Mercosul 
Parliament in 2006.  The body may initially have 
members that are appointed, with gradual evolution 
toward a more representative body.  Other 
announcements included: establishment of a high-level 
meeting to discuss human rights within the Framework 
Agreement on Regional Security Cooperation; agreement 
to develop a Mercosul passport; agreement to establish 
funds for cooperation in education and promotion of 
artistic expression; agreement on the transfer of 
convicts; and the promise to establish a high-level 
group to study employment growth. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
14. (SBU) The inability of Mercosul leaders to once 
again grapple with basic deficiencies that are 
compromising Mercosul\'s development as a customs union 
has stoked skepticism in Brazil\'s private sector 
regarding the bloc\'s viability and usefulness 
(septel).  Nonetheless, commitment to Mercosul runs 
deep within the ruling PT, most importantly with 
President Lula himself.  Continuing trade difficulties 
not withstanding, the GoB will continue to push for 
more, not less, integration within Mercosul, and as 
the big country in the bloc will seek to keep the 
project alive.  As one editorial noted, while the 
summit wasn\'t a party, it wasn\'t a funeral either.

1. (U) This cable reflects input from Consulates General 
Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.  Mission invites comment from 
other posts in the region regarding issues raised herein. 
 
2. (SBU) Summary and Introduction. The Brazilian private 
sector has recently stepped up criticism of GoB trade 
policy, in particular the government\'s emphasis on 
expanding relations with developing (as opposed to 
developed) countries.  Failure of the December 17 Mercosul 
summit to significantly advance the bloc\'s program toward 
achieving a customs union, the relative insignificance of 
Mercosul trade for Brazil, and frustration over Argentine 
restrictions on Brazilian exports have caused some in the 
private sector to propose that the bloc devolve into a free 
trade area, liberating its members to pursue independent 
foreign trade policies.  Despite this increasing 
assertiveness by the private sector on trade matters, and 
in particular on Mercosul, unless President Lula personally 
changes course it is highly unlikely that the GOB will 
abandon or dramatically curtail Mercosul integration 
because of industry concerns.  Despite its apparent lack of 
substance, support for regional integration runs deep 
within the President\'s PT party and the Foreign Ministry. 
Foreign Minister Amorim played a prominent role in 
Mercosul\'s formation while serving in the same position 
during Itamar Franco\'s presidency and sees it as a key 
building block for the larger ideal of a united South 
America (led, presumably, by Brazil).  And while President 
Lula is certainly aware of the industry\'s complaints, so 
far he has consistently supported Amorim\'s vision.  End 
Summary and Introduction. 
 
Plethora of Private Sector Complaints 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Mid-way through the Lula administration, the 
Brazilian private sector has stepped up its criticism of 
GoB trade policy.  The more strident complaints have been 
touched off by a series of government actions and 
\"failures\" that reflect a widening breach between private 
sector and government interests.  The list of GoB 
misconduct includes: the suspension in FTAA negotiations; 
the failure to conclude free trade negotiations with the EU 
in October; the granting of \"market economy status\" to 
China in November (ref a and b), and the GoB\'s conciliatory 
stance toward Argentina as it imposes restrictions on a 
host of Brazilian exports. In reacting to these events, the 
business community, as well as a number of respected 
analysts, has accused the GoB of subordinating tangible 
commercial interests to outdated ideological biases based 
on North-South conflict and to unrelated geopolitical 
objectives. 
 
4. (SBU) Basically, the GoB is under attack for its 
emphasis on relations with other developing countries and 
the perception that these ties are being pursued at the 
expense of relations with Brazil\'s major markets, i.e., the 
United States and the EU, which together receive nearly 50 
percent of Brazil\'s exports.  Given the lackluster results 
of the recent Mercosul Summit (ref c), criticism more 
recently has centered on what is perceived as the GoB\'s 
desire to preserve Mercosul at seemingly whatever cost. 
 
Excessive Focus on Mercosul? 
---------------------------- 
5. (U) Mercosul detractors point to the bloc\'s decreased 
importance to Brazil as a trading partner and the minimal 
economic pay-off likely to result from Mercosul\'s 
\"successful\" trade initiatives to date.  Following the 1994 
Protocol of Ouro Preto, Brazil\'s trade with its Mercosul 
partners grew rapidly, from $10.5 billion in 1994 to $18.5 
billion in 1997, with exports and imports in relative 
balance.  But after leveling off in 1998, Brazil\'s trade 
with Mercosul members declined following Brazil\'s currency 
devaluation in 1999 and Argentina\'s subsequent financial 
crisis, reaching a low of $8.9 billion in 2002.  In 2003, 
Brazilian exports to the bloc started to rebound, growing 
95 percent from the low 2002 level.  Although a further 59 
percent growth in exports and 12 percent growth in imports 
from January through November 2004 have lifted two-way 
trade to around $15 billion, it still remains well below 
the peak trade level recorded in 1997.  Furthermore, 
despite recent growth in Brazil-Mercosul trade, the bloc\'s 
relative importance as a trading partner has declined. 
Trade with Mercosul members accounted for 13.7 percent of 
Brazil\'s trade in 1994, dropping to 9.6 percent a decade 
later. 
 
6. (U) Nor are the bloc\'s newly inked trade deals with 
India, the Southern Africa Customs Union, and with the 
Andean countries expected to produce substantial trade 
gains for Brazil.  Brazil\'s trade with India currently 
stands at a mere $1.2 billion, and the Mercosul-India 
agreement covers only 902 products, about 450 for each 
side.  With respect to the SACU (principally South Africa), 
total trade is about $1 billion, in comparison with 
Brazil\'s expected $160 billion in overall two-way trade for 
2004.  The partial, tariff preference agreements with these 
countries are only expected to marginally expand access for 
Brazilian products (refs c and d). [Note. In a December 28 
editorial, former Brazilian Ambassador to the U.S., Rubens 
Barbosa, claimed the private sector had not been consulted 
and was unaware of which products were covered by these 
agreements.  During December 13-14 meetings with AUSTR 
Broadbent, an array of Brazilian business people leveled 
similar complaints about inadequate consultations by the 
GoB on international trade negotiations in general.] 
 
7. (U) Likewise, recent trade agreements with Peru, 
Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela have generated little 
enthusiasm among the private sector as industry has 
complained about the complex set of rules of origin, the 
large number of exceptions, and the longer tariff phase-out 
accorded to the Andean countries.  The GoB points to growth 
of around 50 percent in trade between Brazil and the Andean 
Community in 2004 as indicative of the importance of the 
trade relationship, but this is from a base of only $3.7 
billion in 2003.  Brazil-Andean Community two-way trade 
totaled a mere $4.5 billion through October 2004. 
 
Negotiating by Committee 
------------------------ 
 
8. (SBU) Critics also disagree with claims by the GoB that 
Brazil\'s leverage vis-a-vis major trading partners is 
enhanced by negotiating as a member of Mercosul, contending 
that conflicting national interests within the bloc impede 
its ability to conclude negotiations with the United States 
and the EU.  The Brazilian private sector insists it was 
Argentine protectionism that forced Mercosul negotiators to 
reduce the level of ambition in the last offer presented to 
the EU, in part causing those negotiations to stall before 
an October 31, 2004 deadline.  Although the business 
community acknowledges that in the FTAA negotiations 
additional factors are at play, such as Brazil\'s reluctance 
to discuss IPR or new investment rules, many here believe 
that unburdened by its less competitive neighbors, Brazil 
could more easily find the basis for a mutually 
advantageous trade agreement with the United States. 
 
Argentina-Brazil \"Refrigerator War\" 
----------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Argentina\'s persistent efforts to restrict 
Brazil\'s exports in the so-called \"refrigerator wars,\" and 
a perceived complacency on the part of the GoB, have also 
highlighted the costs of Mercosul integration for the 
Brazilian business community.  Over the last decade, 
Argentina has typically enjoyed a small, but positive trade 
surplus with Brazil.  Nonetheless, rebounding Brazilian 
exports in 2003 prompted Argentine complaints about import 
surges in various electrodomestic products.  Argentina\'s 
emerging trade deficit with Brazil in 2004 provided 
additional fuel for that country\'s demands that 
restrictions be applied to Brazilian exports of 
refrigerators, washing machines, ovens, televisions, shoes, 
and certain textiles.  From January through November 2004, 
Brazilian exports to Argentina expanded another 64 percent 
reaching $6.7 billion, compared with only 19 percent growth 
($5.1 billion total) in trade in the opposite direction. 
 
10. (U) The conciliatory posture the GoB has adopted, 
encouraging Brazilian producers to negotiate various 
\"voluntary\" export restrictions, has provoke outrage by the 
Brazilian private sector, and at times by Minister of 
Development and Trade Furlan.  Brazilian refrigerator 
producers accepted a monthly quota of 18,160 units, down 
from the 26,354 being sold, limiting their market share to 
50 percent.  Since July, Argentina has assessed a 21.5 
percent additional tariff on televisions manufactured in 
Brazil\'s Manaus Free Trade Zone and has been pressing for 
voluntary limits to reduce yearly imports from 160,000 to 
17,500.  The Argentines are also seeking a reduction in 
market share for Brazilian washing machines from 49 percent 
to 35 percent and subjecting imports to a non-automatic 
licensing regime. 
 
11. (SBU) The final straw for some came in the run-up to 
the December 17 Ouro Preto Summit, when Argentine 
negotiators pressed Brazil to accept adoption of a 
safeguard mechanism within Mercosul that would 
automatically impose quotas should neighboring countries\' 
currency values and rates of economic growth vary 
substantially.  After convening key advisors, on December 8 
President Lula flatly rejected the proposal, raising 
concern that the trade spat could ruin the upcoming summit. 
Although the safeguard proposal was not on the summit 
agenda, the presidents of Uruguay and Paraguay publicly 
supported Brazil\'s position.  However, the war is far from 
over.  Brazilian and Argentine negotiators agreed to set 
aside the negotiations on export restrictions and on a 
potential safeguard for the sake of the summit, but 
discussions will resume in January. 
 
For Brazil, Which Road Forward? 
------------------------------- 
12. (SBU) Given the political importance of Mercosul, few 
in Brazil would advocate a complete abandonment of the 
bloc.  However, two schools of thought are emerging on how 
best to cure Mercosul\'s ills.  One group believes that a 
looser association that allows for greater flexibility in 
accommodating varying national economic interests is the 
way to go.  This group has proposed that Mercosul devolve 
into a free trade area, allowing the free flow of goods 
between members, while enabling them to orient their trade 
with other partners according to national priorities. 
Roberto Gianetti da Fonseca, former Executive Director of 
the GoB\'s trade chamber (CAMEX) during the Cardoso 
administration, and currently head of International 
Relations at the powerful Sao Paulo FIESP industrial 
federation, has been publicly championing this cause.  His 
proposal has rankled Itamaraty (i.e., Brazil\'s Foreign 
Ministry), but resonates among many business leaders. 
 
13. (SBU) The other group, led by President Lula and 
Foreign Minister Amorim, argues that it is more, not less, 
integration that is needed and see current Mercosul 
problems as mere growing pains.  Minister Amorim has 
exhorted the business community to keep the bigger picture 
in mind -- the long-term goal of transforming Mercosul, and 
eventually the South American Community of Nations, into an 
EU-type arrangement.  Brazilian officials point out that 
the EU\'s own formation has been a lengthy and at times 
contentious process.  While acknowledging the trade 
difficulties and attempting to work through them, the GoB\'s 
answer is also to press ahead with political integration as 
quickly as possible to lock-in the integration process. 
Recent steps to strengthen Mercosul institutions in 
Montevideo, and to install a Mercosul parliament in 2006 
are regarded as key steps in that process. 
 
14. (SBU) With Lula lining up with ForMin Amorim, its 
pretty clear which road forward the GOB will take.  Despite 
the increasing assertiveness by the private sector on trade 
matters, and in particular on Mercosul, unless Lula 
personally changes course it is highly unlikely that the 
GOB will abandon or dramatically curtail Mercosul 
integration because of industry concerns.

1. (U) Summary: United States International Trade Commission 
(USITC) Senior International Trade Specialist David 
Ingersoll and International Trade Analyst Christopher Mapes 
visited Brasilia December on December 21-22, 2004, after 
visits to Rio and Sao Paulo to speak to Brazilian 
governmental entities on regulations governing air and noise 
pollution abatement and renewable energy services.  The team 
met with officials at the Ministry of Mines and Energy in 
the renewal energy, petrol and natural gas divisions. They 
also met with the National Agency for Electrical Energy, the 
Ministry of the Environment, and the Superintendent for 
Waste Water Treatment in Brasilia.  GOB policies seem to 
focus more heavily on the development of renewable energy 
sources, with less emphasis on the monitoring and resolution 
of air and water pollution problems. Sao Paulo and Rio will 
send separate reports. End Summary. 
 
2. The Director of Renewable Energy Development at the 
Ministry of Mines and Energy, Laura Porto, explained the 
overall policy goals of the present Administration.  As 
explained, the GOB intends to expand and diversify Brazil\'s 
energy sources, hoping eventually to increase the percentage 
of renewable sources in the matrix and decrease traditional 
fossil fuels. The focus now is on biomass, ethanol, 
hydroelectric and biodiesel. There is also a considerable 
push to decentralize energy sources, taking advantage of the 
potential for wind energy in the northeast, southeast for 
biomass (sugar cane), and hydro electric for small power 
plants in the south where they have good rivers. The Lula 
government is also focusing on services related to the 
treatment of wastewater, solid and hazard waste, cleanup of 
hazardous sites and water purification. 
 
3.  At the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Joao Souto, 
responded to questions about air quality issues. Nationally, 
air quality has improved. Although Brazil has been achieving 
a rapid reduction in the use of substances that destroy the 
ozone layer, burnings and forest fires, out of control in 
some instances, negate much of the positive that has been 
accomplished. Locally, the situation varies. Each 
municipality, he explained, can determine whether it wants 
to enact stricter regulations than those federally mandated. 
States and cities have enforcement powers. 
 
On the issue of noise pollution, apparently, only the larger 
municipalities enforce the regulations. The Ministry of 
Labor and the Ministry of Health set noise limits for 
workers. 
 
4.  At the Agencia Nacional de Energia Electrica, Alvaro 
Mesquita produced an Atlas of Electric Energy in Brazil, 
which included helpful sections on solar, hydro, biomass, 
mineral, natural gas and nuclear. 
 
5.  Others meetings included Victor Zular Zveibil, Secretary 
of Environmental Quality at the Ministry of the Environment 
and Dr. Klaus Dieter Neder, Superintendent of the waste 
water treatment in Brasilia. 
 
6.  The report on the Sao Paulo segment has already been

1.  (U) At the halfway mark of the Lula administration, 
President Lula and Foreign Minister Celso Amorim have decided 
on key Ambassadorial changes, principally in Europe.  Several 
of the high profile Ambassadors had been appointed to their 
present positions by former President Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso. 
 
2.  (U) In Paris former Minister of Development, Industry and 
Foreign Trade, Sergio Amaral, will turn over the embassy to 
Ministry of External Relations (MRE) Under-Secretary for 
Political Affairs Vera Pedrosa, while in Rome ex-President 
Itamar Franco will be replaced by the head of Brazil\'s WTO 
Mission in Geneva, Luiz Felipe de Seixas Correa -- assuming 
the GOB is unsuccessful in its quest to place Seixas Correa 
as WTO Director General. Although critical of then 
Presidential candidate Lula in 2002, then-Minister Amaral had 
been the beneficiary of an agreement between outgoing 
President Cardoso and the newly elected Lula to remain in 
Paris for two years.  A career diplomat, he likely will move 
to Tokyo to succeed current Ambassador to Japan Ivan 
Canabrava, a former MRE Under-Secretary for Political Affairs 
who is slated for posting to Berlin.  Vera Pedrosa, the 
highest ranking woman in Brazil\'s Foreign Service, would stay 
in Paris only until 2006 when she reaches the mandatory GOB 
retirement age. 
 
3.  (U) Current MRE Under-Secretary for Economic and 
Technology Affairs Clodoaldo Hugueney Filho, a strong 
advocate of building ties among developing countries during 
the WTO Doha Round, will replace Seixas Correa in Geneva. And 
from Berlin, Ambassador Jose Artur Denot Medeiros will return 
to Brasilia after completing the maximum ten straight years 
abroad allowed by MRE.  He will assume one of the 
Under-Secretary vacancies opened up by the departures of 
Pedrosa and Hugueney. 
 
4.  (SBU) Two other important Ambassadorial changes had 
already been announced.  Former Defense Minister and seasoned 
diplomat Jose Viegas will head to Madrid, while Ambassador 
Osmar Chohfi departs Spain to head Brazil\'s Mission to the 
OAS in Washington.  Prior to going to Madrid, Viegas was 
tasked by President Lula to complete negotiation with the USG 
for revisions to the 2000 bilateral Technical Safeguards 
Agreement for the Alcantara space launch facility, which has 
not been ratified by the Brazilian Congress.

Headline:  In the Midst of Shopping, a Piracy Offensive 
 
Yesterday [December 23] at nine o\'clock, the Federal Police 
arrested Chinese national Julio Law, brother of Law Kin 
Chong, the biggest smuggler in the country.  Julio was 
given five days of temporary arrest and will have to 
explain the origin of 18 tons of electro-electronics seized 
yesterday in two containers in the Port of Santos, in the 
Baixada Santista. 
 
Julio was followed from his home in Alphaville in Greater 
Sao Paulo to one of his companies on Rua 25 de Marco, in 
downtown Sao Paulo, where he was arrested.  From there, he 
was taken to Federal Police headquarters in Pirituba, 
western zone. 
 
According to the police, the products were in the name of 
one of Julio\'s companies.  Detective Antonio Wagner 
Castilho said that besides electronic goods, they seized 
tennis shoes, purses and watches -- all famous name-brand 
knock-offs. 
 
The containers came from China, passed through Africa where 
the destination and product content were altered, and 
entered Brazil through the Port of Santos, as if they were 
a shipment of plastics. 
 
Five detectives and 31 federal agents participated in the 
operation, from the seizure of the products to the 
detention of Julio Law.  His arrest was decreed by Judge 
Helio Egydio de Matos Nogueira, of the 6th Federal Criminal 
Court, and can be extended for another five days.  Julio 
Law was indicted for contraband, embezzlement, and tax 
evasion. 
 
Law Kim Chon has been in the custody of the Federal Police 
in Brasilia since June 1, 2004.  He was accused of offering 
a bribe to Federal Deputy Luis Antonio de Medeiros, to keep 
himself out of the CPI Piracy report. 
 
At 13h15, military police, justice officials and judicial 
experts conducted an order of search and seizure in the 
Mini-shopping Stand Center on Avenida Paulista.  The 
objective was to apprehend pirated software and computer 
video games.  A young man who worked in one of the stores 
was detained for questioning.

SUBJECT: BRAZIL INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT 2005 
 
REF: 04 STATE 250356 
 
1.   This cable transmits Mission Brazil\'s submission 
of the 2005 Investment Climate Statement. 
 
Introduction - Openness to Foreign Investment 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.   Openness to Foreign Investment.  Brazil knows that 
achieving sustained, rapid growth depends on foreign 
investment and has lifted many restrictions in recent 
years to encourage such investment.  The 1962 Foreign 
Capital law and subsequent amendments govern most 
foreign investment.  Foreign investors have been 
permitted to invest in the Brazilian stock market since 
1991.  The Brazilian Congress approved constitutional 
amendments in 1995 to eliminate the distinction between 
foreign and national capital.  New rules, which 
liberalized considerably foreign investment in equities 
and put foreign investors essentially on an equal 
footing with Brazilians, took effect in 2000.  During 
the high point of the privatization program, Brazil was 
the second largest destination for foreign investment 
among emerging markets, with a peak inflow of $32.8 
billion in 2000; the country remains a leading 
investment destination. 
 
3.   Constitutional amendments passed in 1995 opened 
formerly closed sectors, such as petroleum, 
telecommunications, mining, power generation, and 
internal transport to foreign investors.  In 2002, 
Congress approved a constitutional amendment permitting 
foreign investors to own up to 30% of media companies. 
Restrictions remain on foreign investment in a limited 
number of sectors:  nuclear energy, health services, 
media, rural property, fishing, mail and telegraph, 
aviation and aerospace.  In December 2004, the Congress 
approved and the President signed, the Public-Private 
Investment (PPP) bill that promotes joint ventures in 
infrastructure investment.  The law creates a federal 
guarantee fund to protect investors in federal PPPs. 
In almost all cases, at least 30% of project must be 
private investment funds. 
 
4.   New or expanded foreign investment in the banking 
sector is technically forbidden by the Constitution of 
1988.  However, since 1995 entry or expansion has been 
approved on a case-by-case basis; the vast majority of 
requests for entry or expansion have been granted. 
Foreign banks currently account for one third of the 
total net worth of the banking system and 27% of total 
banking system assets. Since 1996, the insurance sector 
has been open to foreign investors, and most major US 
firms are already represented, mainly via joint venture 
arrangements.  Brazil maintains a government-owned 
reinsurance monopoly, the Brazil Reinsurance Institute 
(IRB).  Plans to privatize the IRB were delayed by 
court challenges.  While the Supreme Court decided in 
September 2004 that the privatization was 
constitutional, the Lula administration has not decided 
to resubmit to Congress a bill privatizing IRB.  A 2003 
Constitutional amendment allows the regulation of the 
reinsurance sector, and permits new market entrants. 
Implementing these provisions would require passage of 
a complementary law, which is not yet on the 
Congressional agenda. 
 
5.   In 1991, Brazil embarked on the world\'s largest 
privatization drive, selling off more than US$ 100 
billion worth of assets.  Since 2002, however, 
privatization has virtually stopped.  Through 2004, 
Brazil realized $87.5 billion in sales revenue and 
another $18.1 billion in debt transfer as a result of 
the national privatization program.  Foreign investment 
accounted for $42 billion, or 48% of the total.  One 
third of the foreign investment was from the US ($14 
billion).  With the exception of power-generation 
sector, most of the largest state enterprises have been 
sold, and privatization activity has died down since 
2001:  in 2002, it totaled only US$ 2 billion; in 2003 
there were no privatizations; and through the first 
half of 2004 the sole new privatization was that of the 
State Bank of Maranhao, for US$ 26.6 million. 
6.   The privatization of the energy sector also was 
halted.  In December 2004, Brazil conducted its first 
auction of long term energy supply contracts under a 
new energy regulatory framework advanced by the Lula 
administration in which the federal government now 
plays a more central role in establishing energy demand 
forecasts and energy prices.  Analysts, companies and 
regulators have expressed concern that the more 
centralized government role and low auction prices will 
inhibit private investments. 
 
7.   During the early 1990s, foreign direct investment 
(FDI) was a crucial source of financing for Brazil\'s 
balance of payments.  However, since 2001 the trade 
balance has improved sharply, helping produce actual 
current-account surpluses in 2003 and 2004.   This 
trend has enabled Brazil easily to weather the steep 
continuing decline of FDI, from $ 22.5 billion in 2001 
to $16.6 billion in 2002 and just $10.1 billion in 
2003.  FDI in 2004 is estimated to have increased to 
about $16 billion. 
 
8.   Brazil has undertaken a significant reduction in 
trade barriers in recent years. In 2004, Brazil\'s 
average Normal Trade Relations (NTR) tariff was 10.8%, 
versus 32% percent in 1990, according to the Foreign 
Trade Secretariat of the Ministry of Development, 
Industry and Foreign Trade. 
 
Conversion and Transfer Policies 
-------------------------------- 
 
9.   There are few restrictions on converting or 
transferring funds associated with an investment. 
Foreign investors may freely convert Brazilian currency 
in the unified foreign exchange market wherein buy-sell 
rates are determined by market forces.  All foreign 
exchange transactions, including identifying data, must 
be reported to the Central Bank.  Foreign-exchange 
transactions on the current account have been fully 
liberalized in practice, and in 2000 the Central Bank 
greatly simplified requirements for capital-account 
transactions. 
 
10.  Foreigners investing in Brazil must register their 
investment with the Central Bank within 30 days of the 
inflow of resources to Brazil.  Registration is done 
electronically.  Investments involving royalties and 
technology transfer must be registered with the patent 
office (INPI) as well.  Investors must have a 
representative in Brazil and register with the 
Brazilian securities commission (CVM).  Subsequent 
transactions, such as reinvestment of profits, may also 
have to be registered with the Central Bank. 
 
11.  Foreign investors, upon registering their 
investment with the Central Bank, are able to remit 
dividends, capital (including capital gains), and, if 
applicable, royalties.  Remittances must also be 
registered with the Central Bank.  Dividends cannot 
exceed corporate profits.  The remittance transaction 
may be carried out at any bank by documenting the 
source of the transaction (evidence of profit or sale 
of assets) and showing that applicable taxes have been 
paid. 
 
12.  Foreign loans obtained abroad no longer require 
advance approval by the Central Bank, provided the 
recipient is not a government entity (loans to 
government entities still require prior approval). 
Upon concluding the transaction, the loan must be 
registered electronically with the Central Bank.  In 
most instances, the registration is completed 
automatically.  Automatic registration is not issued 
when the costs of the operation are \"not compatible 
with normal market conditions and practices.\"  In such 
instances, the loan is reviewed by the Central Bank; if 
the Central Bank does not respond within five working 
days, the registration is considered complete. 
 
13.  Interest and amortization payments specified in 
the loan contract can be made without additional 
approval from the Central Bank.  That also applies to 
early payments, if there is a provision in the contract 
for early payment.  If the contract does not have such 
a provision, early payment requires prior approval by 
the Central Bank.  According to Central Bank officials, 
this requirement is to ensure accurate records of 
Brazil\'s stock of debt, and all requests have been 
approved since the new guidelines were issued in 2000. 
 
14.  In addition to payments associated with registered 
loans and investments, there are other approved 
procedures for transferring funds abroad that in 
practice can be used for a wide range of purposes. 
 
15.  Capital-gain remittances are subject to a 15 
percent income withholding tax.  Repatriation of an 
initial investment is exempt from income tax. 
Beginning in 2000, lease payments were assessed a 15 
percent withholding tax.  Remittances related to 
technology transfers are not subject to the tax on 
credit, foreign exchange, and insurance (IOF), although 
they are subject to a 15% withholding tax and an extra 
10% Contribution of Intervention in the Economic Domain 
(CIDE).  Loans with terms of 90 days or less must pay 
the IOF (5%), while those of longer maturity do not. 
In 2002, Brazil eliminated the application of the 
financial transaction tax (CPMF), which is currently 
0.38%, to stock market transactions.  Brazil has no 
double taxation treaty with the US, but does have such 
treaties with a number of other countries, including, 
among others, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Canada and Argentina. 
 
Expropriation and Compensation 
------------------------------ 
 
16.  There have been no expropriatory actions in Brazil 
in the recent past nor any signs that the current 
Government is contemplating such actions.  In 1999, a 
state government sought and obtained a court ruling 
canceling contractual obligations, signed by the prior 
state government, associated with the partial 
privatization of a state electricity company.  The U.S. 
investors are appealing the court ruling.  In 2003, a 
newly inaugurated government in another state refused 
to honor a number of contracts the previous state 
government had signed with a range of Brazilian and 
foreign investors; the parties involved continue to 
negotiate these contract disputes and have had recourse 
to local courts.  Some claims regarding land 
expropriations by state agencies many years ago have 
been judged by courts in US citizens\' favor.  There 
remain individuals who have not yet been compensated 
because the states have appealed these decisions. 
 
Dispute Settlement 
------------------ 
 
17.  Brazil is not a member of the International Center 
for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID - also 
known as the Washington Convention), but it is a party 
to the New York Convention of 1958 on the recognition 
and enforcement of foreign arbitration awards.  In 
August 1995, Brazil ratified the 1975 Interamerican 
Convention on International Commercial Arbitration, as 
well as the 1979 Interamerican Convention on 
Extraterritorial Validity of Foreign Judgments and 
Arbitral Awards. 
 
18.  Arbitration clauses in contracts are not 
automatically enforceable.  Foreign arbitral awards 
require confirmation by a court of the country in which 
the award was rendered and by the Brazilian Supreme 
Court.  This confirmation is procedural in nature, and 
not meant to consider the merits of the case. 
Confirmation by the Supreme Court allows the claimant 
to enforce the arbitral award through Brazilian courts. 
The Supreme Court has confirmed foreign arbitral awards 
between two private parties in multiple cases. 
 
19.  There is some legal controversy in Brazil over 
binding foreign arbitration between foreign investors 
and state entities.  Some Brazilian legal 
interpretations claim this is prohibited under 
Brazilian law on the grounds that it infringes the 
sovereign rights of the state.  The Federal Government 
nevertheless maintains, in the absence of a definitive 
judicial ruling on the issue, that it can agree to 
binding foreign arbitration and routinely enters into 
contracts that allow for such arbitration. 
 
20.  This legal uncertainty, as well as congressional 
politics, has held up ratification of Bilateral 
Investment Agreements that Brazil has signed with about 
fourteen countries (not including the US), which call 
for arbitration by either ICSID or a panel set up under 
the United Nations Rules for International Commercial 
Law.  Given the doubts about the applicability under 
Brazilian law of these international arbitration 
provisions to Brazilian government entities, the 
government in December 2003 withdrew the agreements 
from consideration for Senate ratification. 
 
21.  Brazil has a functional commercial code that 
governs most aspects of commercial association, except 
for corporations formed for the provision of 
professional services, which are governed by the civil 
code.  In December 2004, Congress approved an overhaul 
of the bankruptcy code.  The reforms create a system, 
modeled on Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, 
which allows a company in financial straits to 
negotiate a restructuring with its creditors outside of 
the courts.  In the event a company does fail despite 
restructuring efforts, the reforms give creditors a 
better chance at recovering their debts.  An 
overburdened court system is available for enforcing 
property rights but decisions can take years.  Judicial 
reform measures enacted in December 2004 streamline 
administrative procedures, and, by introducing the 
concept of binding precedent, should, over time, make 
judicial decisions more predictable. 
 
Political Violence (As It May Affect Investments) 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
22.  Brazil\'s major urban centers suffer from 
significant drug trafficking-related and organized 
crime-related violence.  Poverty, gangs, drugs and a 
lack of government resources have combined to erode 
state authority in some urban slums (favelas).  There 
have been episodes of drug-related violence prompting 
major police crackdowns, particularly in Rio de 
Janeiro.  Police have been implicated in significant 
human rights violations, including extra-judicial 
killings, abuse of prisoners, and other criminal 
activity.  Since mid-2003 the Landless Workers\' 
Movement  (MST) has continued its aggressive invasions 
of a variety of agricultural interests, both domestic 
and foreign, in its campaign to force redistribution of 
land.  In rural areas, powerful landowners, sometimes 
aided by police or private security agents, have used 
violence to settle land disputes, including but not 
limited to those with the MST or indigenous peoples, 
and to influence the local judiciary. 
 
Performance Requirements and Incentives 
--------------------------------------- 
 
23.  Geographic preferences consist of tax benefits for 
investment in less developed parts of the country, such 
as the Northeast and the Amazon, with equal application 
to foreign and domestic investors.  These benefits have 
succeeded in attracting some major foreign plants to, 
for example, the Manaus Free Trade Zone, but most 
foreign investment remains concentrated in the more 
industrialized southern part of Brazil.  Individual 
states have sought to attract investment by offering ad 
hoc tax benefits and infrastructure support to specific 
companies.  Some municipalities provide land on 
favorable terms for industrial development. 
 
24.  In firms employing three or more persons, 
Brazilian nationals must constitute at least two-thirds 
of all employees and receive at least two-thirds of 
total payroll.   Foreign specialists in fields where 
Brazilians are unavailable are not counted in 
calculating the one-third permitted for non-Brazilians. 
 
25.  The Special Agency for Industrial Financing 
(FINAME) of the National Bank for Economic and Social 
Development (BNDES) provides financing for purchases by 
Brazilian firms of Brazilian-made machinery and 
equipment -- capital goods with a high level of 
domestic content.  The government also has a series of 
smaller programs designed to assist small and medium 
sized businesses export. 
 
Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
26.  Foreign and domestic private entities may 
establish, own, and dispose of business enterprises. 
 
Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
27.  Brazil is a signatory to the GATT Uruguay Round 
Accords, including the Trade Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property (TRIPS) Agreement, signed in 
April 1994.  Brazil is a member of the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and a 
signatory of the Bern Convention on artistic property, 
the Washington Patent Cooperation Treaty, and the Paris 
Convention on Protection of Intellectual Property.  In 
August 1992, Brazil removed its reservations and fully 
accepted the Stockholm revision of the Paris 
Convention.  Brazil has not yet ratified the WIPO 
Treaties on Copyright and Performances and Phonograms. 
As a result of continuing problems regarding protection 
of intellectual property rights, principally in 
enforcement, Brazil remains on the Special 301 priority 
watch list following the early 2004 review. 
 
28.  Patents. In most respects, Brazil\'s 1996 
Industrial Property law brings its patent and trademark 
regime up to the international standards specified in 
the TRIPS Agreement.   However, the law includes 
compulsory licensing and local working requirements 
which may be TRIPS-inconsistent.  The law would 
theoretically permit the grant of a compulsory license 
if a patent owner has failed to \"work\" (i.e. locally 
manufacture) the patented invention in Brazil within 
three years of issuance.  Brazil has agreed to consult 
with the US before any potential invocation of the 
local working requirement; to date, Brazil has yet to 
grant a compulsory license. 
 
29.  Trademarks. The fraudulent use of internationally 
\"famous\" marks has been a problem in Brazil.  However, 
the Industrial Property Law has provided improvements 
in Brazil\'s trademark regime, including better 
protection for internationally known trademarks.  Some 
foreign firms have been successful in court actions 
against trademark infringement.  Trademark licensing 
agreements must be registered with the National 
Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) to be 
enforceable; however, the failure to register licensing 
agreements will no longer result in cancellation of 
trademark registration for non-use. 
 
30.  Copyrights.  Brazil\'s copyright law generally 
conforms to world-class standards.  Likewise, its 
software copyright protection law contains provisions 
that introduce a rental right and an increase in the 
term of protection to 50 years.  Despite passage of 
these copyright laws in 1998, widespread piracy of 
copyright and trademark material remains a problem. 
Government efforts to stem the flow of pirated goods 
through its ports and across the border with Paraguay 
have, to date, been largely unsuccessful.  The US 
private sector estimates that trade losses from 
copyright infringements (including from piracy of 
videocassettes sound recordings and musical 
compositions, books and computer software) were $907 
million in 2003. 
31.  In May 2001, the Government created an inter- 
ministerial committee to address copyright piracy, but 
a national strategy for combating piracy on a 
comprehensive scale has yet to emerge.  A sting 
operation at a border crossing in Foz do Iguacu in 
early 2003 also resulted in the arrest of a number of 
government officials involved with smuggling 
operations.  A significant number of raids and seizures 
were carried out in 2004 in the same border region, as 
well as in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.  The judicial 
system, however, remains an ineffective deterrent. 
 
32.  To enhance enforcement efforts, the Brazilian 
Congress passed a law in July 2003 that establishes 
prison terms of two to four years for copyright 
violations, not only for those selling pirated 
products, but also for those convicted of renting, 
smuggling, hiding or acquiring counterfeit copyright 
products.  The new law also establishes procedures for 
making arrests and destroying confiscated products.  A 
much-publicized Special Congressional Inquiry into IPR 
piracy completed its report in June 2004, amidst 
considerable sensation after a reputed piracy kingpin 
was arrested on charges of trying to bribe the chairman 
of the inquiry commission. 
 
33.  Integrated Circuit Layout Designs.  A government- 
drafted bill to provide protection for the layout 
design of integrated circuits (computer mask works) was 
introduced in the Brazilian Congress in April 1996. 
The draft law was still under discussion in 2004. 
However, the Government\'s Industrial Policy measures 
announced in early 2004 prioritize passage of this bill 
to stimulate innovation in local production. 
 
Regulatory System (as it pertains to investments) 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
34.  Although some improvements have been made, the 
Brazilian legal and procedural system is complex and 
overburdened.  State courts in particular can be 
subject to political influence.  The central government 
has historically exercised considerable control over 
private business through extensive and frequently 
changing regulations.  The bureaucracy has broad 
discretionary authority. 
 
35.  Taxes are numerous and burdensome, but do not 
discriminate between foreign and domestic firms, 
although in a few instances there have been complaints 
that the value-added tax collected by individual states 
(ICMS) is set to favor local companies.  Taxes on 
commercial and financial transactions are particularly 
burdensome, and businesses complain that these taxes 
hinder international competitiveness of Brazilian 
products.  Brazil has separate value-added tax systems 
run by the federal and state governments, and also 
imposes several invoice taxes that are cumulative.  In 
2002, one of the invoice taxes was converted to a value- 
added tax.  In 2003, the administration presented tax 
reform legislation to congress that would simplify the 
value-added tax collected by the states and convert 
another invoice tax to a value-added tax, but this 
draft legislation was subsequently deferred until at 
least 2005. 
 
36.  Regulatory agencies for sectors such as 
telecommunications, energy and transportation are a 
relatively young phenomenon in Brazil.  ANATEL, the 
country\'s telecommunication agency, handles licensing 
and assigns bandwidth.  The National Petroleum Agency 
(ANP) is commended by the industry for its fair 
handling of auctions of oil exploration blocks and its 
willingness to assist industry in seeking to simplify 
regulatory procedures such as environmental licensing. 
Conversely, in the electric power sector, many 
companies have complained about the high level of 
regulatory risk, for example the tariff review process 
and the implementation of the Brazil\'s new energy 
policy.  The federal government in 2003 passed 
legislation setting fixed three-year terms for 
directors of the regulatory agencies.  New legislation 
to further clarify the roles and responsibilities of 
the regulatory agencies and consolidate into one the 
multiple laws governing each separate regulator 
currently is being considered by the Congress. 
 
Bilateral Investment Agreements (BITs) 
-------------------------------------- 
 
37.  Brazil has signed Bilateral Investment Agreements 
(BITs) with fourteen countries.  There are two Mercosul 
investment-related agreements:  the Buenos Aires 
Protocol (\"extra-bloc\") and the Colonia Protocol 
(\"intra-bloc\"); the latter has not been signed by 
Brazil.  Seven of the bilateral investment treaties 
have been sent to the Brazilian Congress, but have not 
been ratified.  All of these treaties pending 
ratification were withdrawn from Senate consideration 
by the Executive in late 2003.  The Executive cited the 
need for further review of the treaties so as to avoid 
potential juridical conflicts.  At issue are the 
international arbitration clauses of these treaties, 
which may not be binding on Brazilian government 
agencies under Brazilian law. The US signed an 
Investment Warranty Treaty with Brazil in 1965 (OPIC). 
The US and Brazil currently have no plans to discuss a 
BIT. 
 
OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
38.  Programs of the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation (OPIC) are fully available, and activity 
has increased in recent years.  The size of OPIC\'s 
exposure in Brazil may occasionally limit its capacity 
for new coverage.  For more information on OPIC, please 
go to http://www.opic.gov. 
 
39.  Brazil became a member of the Multilateral 
Investment Guarantee Agency in 1992. 
 
Capital Outflow Policy 
---------------------- 
 
40.  There are few restrictions on converting or 
transferring funds associated with an investment. 
However, the Central Bank has broad administrative 
discretion in regulating remittances, which in the past 
has created problems for foreign investors.  At this 
time, foreign investors may freely convert Brazilian 
currency at the \"commercial\" rate.  The Central Bank is 
working on a new regulatory regime for capital flows to 
simplify bureaucratic requirements while retaining 
necessary reporting requirements. 
 
41.  There has been a relaxation since 1991 of the 
restrictions on the remittances of royalty payments for 
patent and trademark use between subsidiaries 
established in Brazil and the parent office 
headquartered overseas and on remittances of franchise 
contract royalties.  A 1992 INPI resolution simplified 
procedures and, in particular, eliminated a number of 
requirements (but not all) concerning technology 
transfer agreements.  No royalties or other fees may be 
transferred between related companies for the use of 
software. 
 
Labor 
----- 
 
42.  The Brazilian labor force comprises nearly 84 
million workers in a wide range of occupations and 
industries.  Nearly half of the labor force is employed 
in the service sector, roughly a quarter in 
agriculture, and the retail and manufacturing sectors 
combine to employ another quarter.  The participation 
of women, who now account for over 40 percent of the 
labor force, continues to grow.  The labor market has a 
high rate of informal sector employment; most sources 
estimate that at least half of all workers are not 
formally registered, pay no income taxes, and do not 
enjoy full protection under the law.  About a quarter 
of all workers are self-employed. 
 
43.  Unemployment - Significant. The Brazilian 
Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) calculates 
an average unemployment rate for the country based on 
data collected monthly in Brazil\'s six largest 
metropolitan areas.  According to this survey, the 
unemployment rate in November 2004 was 10.6%.   This 
average masks some significant variation, from a high 
of 15.9% in Salvador to a low of 7.8% in Porto Alegre. 
 
44.  Real Wages Halt Decline, Disparities Significant. 
Real wages in 2004 halted an almost decade long slide. 
Real wages were up 2.6% in November 2004 over November 
2003.  The average monthly wage in Brazil\'s six largest 
cities was approximately 905 Reals (approximately $332) 
in November 2004, and the minimum monthly wage was 
raised from 240 Reals ($80) to 260 Reals ($87) in April 
2004.  These averages gloss over some stark wage 
inequalities, as the wealthiest 50% of the Brazilian 
population earn nearly 90 percent of the total income. 
Earnings also vary significantly by region and 
industry.  The typical industrial worker in Sao Paulo, 
for example, earns about three times as much as the 
average retail worker in the northeastern state of 
Bahia. 
 
45.  Differences in earnings are caused in part by the 
regional disparity in educational attainment and in the 
availability of skilled workers.  According to a 2002 
survey by IBGE, 60 percent of the population has fewer 
than 8 years of schooling, with this number reaching 45 
percent in the Southeast (including Rio and Sao Paulo) 
and 70 percent in the Northeast (including Recife and 
Salvador).  Illiteracy rates also exhibit regional 
disparities.  The IBGE reports that about 11 percent of 
the population is illiterate, with 7 percent illiteracy 
in the Southeast and 21 percent in the Northeast. 
 
46.  Unions Play a Significant Role.  Labor unions, 
especially in sectors such as metalworking and banking, 
tend to be well-organized and aggressive in defending 
wages and working conditions.  In more remote areas 
with smaller local unions, however, unions tend to be 
less effective.  Union members account for 
approximately 12 percent of the workforce, but unions 
represent more than twice this number in collective 
bargaining.  Unions, which are funded largely by a 
mandatory tax equivalent to one day\'s wages per year, 
are obliged to represent all formal sector workers in a 
professional category and geographical area, regardless 
of membership status. 
 
47.  The Ministry of Labor estimates that there are 
over 16,000 labor unions in Brazil, but Ministry 
officials note that these figures are inexact.  Local 
unions often associate with state federations and 
national confederations in their professional category. 
In addition, four major labor federations, known as 
\"centrals,\" have emerged: the Workers\' Unitary Central 
(CUT), the Union Force (Forca Sindical - FS), the 
Workers\' General Confederation (CGT), and the Social 
Democratic Union (SDS).  Labor unions channel much of 
the political activity of the labor movement.  They 
also organize strikes and salary campaigns involving 
multiple professional categories and represent workers 
in many governmental and tripartite councils.  While 
some labor organizations and their leadership operate 
independently of the government and of political 
parties, others are viewed as closely associated with 
political parties. 
 
48.  Extensive Regulation, Slow Legal System.  The 
labor code is highly detailed and relatively generous; 
formal sector workers are guaranteed 30 days of annual 
leave, an annual bonus equal to one month\'s salary, and 
severance pay in the case of dismissal without cause. 
Brazil also has a system of labor courts that are 
charged with resolving routine cases involving unfair 
dismissal, working conditions, salary disputes, and 
other grievances.  Currently, over 2.5 million cases 
languish in the labor court system, where they may 
remain unresolved for four or five years.  The 
Brazilian government is attempting to reduce this 
backlog and increase the efficiency of the labor courts 
through recent initiatives to expedite legal procedures 
and increase the number of claims that are resolved 
before reaching the courts. 
49.  Labor courts have the power to impose an agreement 
on employers and unions if negotiations break down and 
either side appeals to the court system.  As a result, 
labor courts routinely are called upon to determine 
wages and working conditions in industries across the 
country.   The system is tantamount to compulsory 
arbitration and does not encourage collective 
bargaining.  In recent years, however, both labor and 
management have become more flexible and collective 
bargaining has assumed greater relevance.  The Inter- 
Union Department of Socioeconomic Studies and 
Statistics (DIEESE) no longer collects data on the 
number of strikes each month.  Strikes have been a 
frequent occurrence, however, particularly among public 
sector unions.  During 2004, federal police, health 
workers, social security workers, university staff, and 
customs officers were out on strike. 
 
Major Foreign Investors 
----------------------- 
 
50.  According to the Central Bank\'s most recent 
foreign-capital census (December 2000), the US was the 
largest single foreign investor in Brazil followed by 
Spain, Netherlands, France, Germany and Portugal. 
Investment from the Cayman Islands began growing 
rapidly in 1995 and is thought to represent mainly 
repatriation of Brazilian capital entering the country 
as foreign investment and, to a lesser extent, 
investment activity by other national groups. 
Investment from Spain and Portugal surged beginning in 
1998 due to involvement in telecom privatizations and 
greatly increased investment in the banking sector by 
Spain. 
 
51.  The stock of direct foreign investment in Brazil 
stood at $103 billion as of December 2000, the most 
recent year for which detailed data is available.  Of 
this, the US had the largest share at about $24.5 
billion (24%).  Spain had 11.9% of the total ($12.2 
billion) and The Netherlands 10.7% ($11.0 billion). 
Investment inflows since 2000 (not net of capital 
repatriation or depreciation) have amounted to about 
$65 billion. 
 
52.  Four US companies - GM, Bunge, Cargill and IBM - 
are among the top twenty domestic firms.  Six of the 
top ten importing firms in 2003 were foreign: Nokia, 
Motorola, Bunge, Volkswagen, Ford Motor Co. and 
DaimlerChrysler.  Five of the top ten exporters -- 
Bunge, Volkswagen, Cargill, General Motors and Ford -- 
represented foreign investment. 
 
Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
53.  Banking Shakeout Results in Improved System.  The 
Brazilian financial sector is large and sophisticated, 
in part a legacy of the high inflation period when good 
financial management was critical to financial 
survival.  Despite current moderate inflation rates, 
bank-lending spreads remain extremely high due to 
taxation, repayment risk, lack of judicial enforcement 
of contracts, high mandatory reserve requirements and 
administrative overhead. 
 
54.  Brazilian banks have weathered a difficult period 
of consolidation and streamlining over the last decade. 
The elimination of high inflation in the mid-1990s, and 
with it the disappearance of so-called \"float income,\" 
led to liquidity problems among many banks.  A series 
of failures, mergers, and acquisitions took place in 
1996 and 1997; three of the country\'s ten largest banks 
failed and were taken over by other banks, and some 20 
smaller banks were liquidated.  Today, the financial 
sector is fairly concentrated, with the 10 largest 
institutions accounting for over 65% of financial 
sector assets.  Lending by these institutions is 
likewise focused on the largest companies, leaving 
small and medium-sized companies underserved.  The 
surviving banks have returned to profitability; the 
largest banks attained record profits in 2002 and 2003 
despite the weak economy. 
 
55.  Most government-owned banks, in particular those 
that were owned by state governments, have been 
privatized.  These insolvent institutions were taken 
over by the federal government, liquidated, privatized, 
or transformed into development agencies.  Three 
federally owned banks, the largest in the country, 
still play a prominent role in the financial system. 
These federal banks, while in better shape than their 
state-level counterparts, were also undercapitalized 
and carrying poorly performing loans, many the result 
of the loss-making \"social\" lending.  These banks have, 
to an extent, recapitalized by selling back government 
bonds.  Extraordinary bank profits in 2002 and 2003 
also have improved the health of their balance sheets. 
As part of an effort to prevent the need for future 
recapitalizations of these federal banks, the 
government now requires that loss-making social lending 
programs by any government-owned bank be supported with 
an explicit government subsidy. 
 
56.  Dealing with the bank failures and consolidations 
of the last several years has led the Central Bank to 
strengthen bank audits, implement more stringent 
internal control requirements, and tighten capital 
adequacy rules to better reflect risk.  It also 
established loan classification and provisioning 
requirements.  These measures are applied to private 
and publicly owned banks alike. 
 
57.  Stock Markets Not an Option For Most Companies. 
Only a few, primarily large, corporations raise capital 
through the Brazilian stock exchanges.  In 2003, two 
new issues in the primary market raised $174.3 million. 
In June 2004, Brazilian airline Gol executed an initial 
public share offering simultaneously on the Sao Paulo 
and New York stock exchanges.  Nevertheless, the total 
number of companies listed on the Sao Paulo stock 
market (BOVESPA) fell to 361 as of June 2004, compared 
to 399 in 2002 and 428 in 2001.  Some companies find 
the benefits of maintaining a listing on the stock 
exchange do not justify the cost.  Total turnover in 
the secondary market was $68.1 billion in 2003. 
Trading is highly concentrated, with the top 10 stocks 
accounting for over 50 percent of turnover.  Some 71 
Brazilian firms, including Petrobras, Embraer, Banco 
Itau, CVRD, Brasil Telecom and Ambev, are also listed 
on the NYSE via American Depository Receipts (ADR\'s). 
 
58.  In 2000, with the intent of promoting the stock 
market and improving liquidity, the numerous regional 
stock markets agreed to consolidate.  All stock trading 
is now done on the Sao Paulo stock market, while 
trading of public securities is conducted on the Rio de 
Janeiro market.  The Sao Paulo stock market also 
launched a \"New Market,\" in which the listed companies 
would comply with strict corporate governance 
requirements.  As of June 2004, the new market has 31 
listed companies. 
 
59.  Until recently, up to two-thirds of a 
corporation\'s capital could be preferred (non-voting) 
shares, so that it was possible to achieve majority 
control of voting shares, in some cases, by holding 
only 17 percent of total capital.  In 2001, the 
Congress approved a law that limits preferred shares 
for new issuances to 50 percent.  The same proposal 
strengthens rights for minority shareholders. 
 
60.  The Brazilian Securities Exchange Commission (CVM) 
directly regulates the stock exchanges, brokers, 
distributors, pension funds, mutual funds, and leasing 
companies.  In 2001, new legislation granted the CVM 
independence and established stronger penalties against 
insider trading. 
 
61.  In January 2000, Brazilian regulators removed a 
number of remaining restrictions on foreign portfolio 
investment.  As a result, foreign investors - both 
institutions and individuals - can directly invest in 
equities, securities and derivatives.  The foreign 
investors are required to trade derivatives and stocks 
of publicly held companies on established markets. 
 
62.  Export Credit Availability.  BNDES, the government 
national development bank, is the primary Brazilian 
source of longer-term credit, and also provides export 
credits.  FINAME (Special Agency for Industrial 
Financing) provides foreign and domestic companies 
operating in Brazil financing for the manufacturing and 
marketing of capital goods.  FINAMEX (Export Financing) 
is a part of FINAME, which finances capital good 
exports for both foreign and domestic companies.  An 
export credit program for capital and some consumer 
durable goods, known as PROEX, was established in 1991. 
PROEX receives funds from the National Treasury to 
offer assistance in the areas of interest rate 
equalization, capital and other goods exports, and 
service exports. 
 
63.  Other Issues: Accounting and Mergers.  Wholly 
owned subsidiaries of multinational accounting firms, 
including the major US firms, are present in Brazil. 
The failure of major banks and large businesses during 
1995, notwithstanding positive financial statements 
prepared by the major accounting firms, raised doubts 
about the credibility of these financial statements. 
Beginning in 1996, auditors have been personally liable 
for the accuracy of accounting statements prepared for 
banks. 
 
64.  Brazilian law recognizes mergers, in which one 
company loses its separate identity by being merged 
into another, and consolidations, in which the pre- 
existing companies are extinguished and a new entity 
emerges.  The procedures for both are essentially the 
same.  Sales of Brazilian companies usually result from 
private negotiations, rather than stock exchange 
activities.  Acquisitions resulting in market 
concentration in excess of 20 percent are subject to 
review by the Administrative Council for Economic 
Defense (CADE) under Brazil\'s 1994 Anti-trust Law.

AND FINANCIAL CRIMES

1.   This cable transmits Embassy Brasilia\'s submission of 
Part II of the 2004-2005 International Narcotics Control 
Strategy Report (INCSR), on Money Laundering and Financial 
Crimes.  Ref B is post\'s submission of Part I of the INCSR. 
 
2.   Due to its great size and large economy, Brazil is 
considered a regional financial center, but it is not an 
offshore financial center. Brazil maintains adequate banking 
regulation, retains some controls on capital flows, and 
requires disclosure of the ownership of corporations. 
Brazilian authorities report that money laundering in Brazil 
is primarily a problem of domestic crime, including the 
smuggling of contraband goods and corruption, both of which 
generate funds that may be laundered through the banking 
system, real estate investment or financial asset markets. 
The proceeds of narcotics trafficking and organized criminal 
activities are laundered in a similar fashion. An Inter- 
American Development Bank study of money laundering in the 
region found that Brazil\'s relatively strong institutions 
helped reduce the incidence of money laundering to well 
below the average for the region. 
 
3.   The GoB adopted and began implementing in 2004 a new 
national strategy document for combating money laundering. 
The strategy includes 32 actions, grouped into six strategic 
goals: 1) better coordinate disparate federal and state 
level anti-money laundering efforts; 2) take advantage of 
computerized databases and public registries to facilitate 
the fight against money laundering; 3) evaluate and improve 
existing mechanisms to combat money laundering; 4) increase 
international cooperation to fight money laundering and 
recover assets; 5) promote an anti-money laundering culture; 
and, 6) to prevent money laundering before its occurrence. 
The first major coordination action taken under the new plan 
was the creation of a new high-level coordination council 
(the GGI-LD), led by the Ministry of Justice\'s Office for 
Asset Seizure and International Judicial Cooperation.  The 
GGI-LD determines overall strategy and priorities, which are 
then implemented by Brazil\'s financial intelligence unit, 
the Council for the Control of Financial Activities (COAF), 
which has been strengthened with additional analysts. 
Specific cases are then assigned to law enforcement task 
forces for investigation. 
 
4.   Implementation of much of the strategy is ongoing. 
Among the more ambitious efforts is the drafting of 
legislative changes to facilitate greater law enforcement 
access to financial and banking records during 
investigations, criminalize illicit enrichment, allow 
administrative freezing of assets and facilitate 
prosecutions of money laundering -- and terrorism finance - 
by refining the legal definition of money laundering and de- 
linking it from the current exhaustive list of predicate 
crimes.  The GoB reportedly plans to present to Congress in 
early 2005 a bill enacting these changes.  Creation of a 
unified database of all money laundering investigations and 
a national level registry of real estate, which would aid 
investigators, also is contemplated.  An existing effort to 
create a database of all current accounts in the country, 
updated in real time, is also expected to come to fruition 
in 2005. 
 
5.   Money laundering in Brazil is primarily related to 
drugs, corruption, and trade in contraband. In 2004 the GOB 
continued investigating corrupt public figures, including 
customs inspectors, federal tax authorities, and high- 
ranking politicians, and the use of offshore companies to 
launder money. The COAF has also investigated instances of 
money laundering linked to the sale and purchase of luxury 
automobiles. This market is currently an unregulated sector 
in Brazil. Other schemes involve the purchase of winning 
lottery tickets to justify the increase of funds. Under 
Brazil\'s anti-money laundering law, the lottery sector must 
notify COAF of the names and data of any winners of three or 
more prizes equal to or higher than 10,000 Reais within a 12- 
month period. According to Brazilian authorities, Brazilian 
institutions do not engage in currency transactions that 
include significant amounts of U.S. currency, currency 
derived from illegal drug sales in the U.S., or that 
otherwise significantly affect the U.S. The authorities 
believe that organized crime groups use the proceeds of 
domestic drug trafficking to purchase weapons from Colombian 
guerrilla groups. 
 
6.   The GOB has a comprehensive anti-money laundering 
regulatory regime in place. Law 9.613 of March 3, 1998, 
criminalizes money laundering related to drug trafficking, 
terrorism, arms trafficking, extortion, and organized crime, 
and penalizes offenders with a maximum of 16 years in 
prison. The law expands the GOB\'s asset seizure and 
forfeiture provisions and exempts \"good faith\" compliance 
from criminal or civil prosecution. Regulations issued in 
1998 require that individuals transporting more than 10,000 
Reais (then approximately $10,000, now approximately $3,700) 
in cash, checks, or traveler\'s checks across the Brazilian 
border must fill out a customs declaration that is sent to 
the Central Bank. Financial institutions remitting more than 
10,000 Reais also must make a declaration to the Central 
Bank. On June 11, 2002, then President Cardoso signed Law 
10.467, which modified Law 9.613. The new law put into 
effect Decree 3,678 of November 30, 2000, which penalizes 
active corruption in international commercial transactions 
by foreign public officials. Law 10.467 also added penalties 
for this offense under Chapter II of Law 9.613. 
 
7.   Law 9.613 also created a financial intelligence unit 
(FIU), i.e. the Council for the Control of Financial 
Activities (COAF), which is housed within the Ministry of 
Finance. The COAF includes representatives from regulatory 
and law enforcement agencies, including the Central Bank and 
Federal Police. The COAF regulates those financial sectors 
not already under the jurisdiction of another supervising 
entity. Currently, the COAF has a staff of 28, comprised of 
18 analysts, two international organizations specialists, a 
counterterrorism specialist, and support staff. A new 
director was appointed in February 2004. 
 
8.   Between 1999 and 2001, the COAF issued a series of 
regulations that require customer identification, record 
keeping, and reporting of suspicious transactions to the 
COAF by obligated entities. Entities that fall under the 
regulation of the Central Bank, the Securities Commission 
(CVM), the Private Insurance Superintendence (SUSEP), and 
the Office of Supplemental Pension Plans (PC), file 
suspicious activity reports (SARs) with their respective 
regulator, either in electronic or paper format. The 
regulatory body then electronically submits the SARs to 
COAF. Entities that do not fall under the regulations of the 
above-mentioned bodies, such as real estate brokers, money 
remittance businesses, factoring companies, gaming and 
lotteries, dealers in jewelry and precious metals, bingo, 
credit card companies, commodities trading, and dealers in 
art and antiques, are regulated by the COAF and send SARs 
directly to the FIU either via the Internet or using paper 
forms. All of these regulations include a list of guidelines 
that help institutions identify suspicious transactions. The 
COAF receives roughly 300 to 500 SARs per month, about two 
percent of which lead to investigations by law enforcement. 
 
9.   The Central Bank has established the Department to 
Combat Exchange and Financial Crimes (DECIF) to implement 
anti-money laundering policy, examine entities under the 
supervision of the Central Bank to ensure compliance with 
suspicious transaction reporting, and forward information on 
the nature of the suspect transaction to the COAF.  Since 
the January 2001 passage of Complementary Law No. 105 and 
its implementing Decree No. 3,724, all government 
authorities, including the COAF, have been able to access 
complete bank transaction information during an 
investigation without a court order. On January 11, 2002, 
then President Cardoso signed Brazil\'s new omnibus drug 
legislation, which allows for the suspension of bank secrecy 
during drug trafficking investigations. 
 
10.  On July 9, 2003, Law 10.701 was passed to modify Law 
9.613 of 1998. Law 10.701 criminalizes terrorist financing 
and makes it a predicate offense for money laundering. The 
law also establishes crimes against foreign governments as a 
predicate offenses, requires the Central Bank to create and 
maintain a registry, expected to come on-line in 2005, of 
information on all bank account holders, and enables the 
COAF to request from all government entities financial 
information on any subject suspected of involvement in 
criminal activity. Other measures enacted in 2003 required 
banks to report cash transactions exceeding 10,000 Reais 
(approximately $3,700) to the Central Bank, established a 
department within the Ministry of Justice to recover 
financial assets, and designated a representative from the 
Ministry of Justice to the COAF. 
 
11.  Brazil has established systems for identifying, 
tracing, freezing, seizing, and forfeiting narcotics-related 
assets. The COAF and the Ministry of Justice manage these 
systems jointly. Police authorities and the customs and 
revenue services are responsible for tracing and seizing 
assets, and have adequate police powers and resources to 
perform such activities. The judicial system has the 
authority to forfeit seized assets. Brazilian law permits 
the sharing of forfeited assets with other countries. 
Traffickers have not taken any retaliatory actions related 
to money laundering investigations, government cooperation 
with the U.S. Government, or the seizure of assets. 
 
12.  Brazil has some ability to employ advanced law 
enforcement techniques such as undercover operations, 
controlled delivery, and use of electronic evidence and task 
force investigations that are critical to the successful 
investigation of complex crimes, such as money laundering. 
Generally such techniques can be used only for information 
purposes, and are not admissible in court. In 2003, 
Brazilian courts handed down their first criminal conviction 
for money laundering. The case involved illegal transfers of 
money overseas through a currency exchange in Foz do Iguacu. 
A flood of new investigations (1,043 in 2003, up from 345 in 
2002) has led to a sharp spike in the number of money 
laundering cases going to court (132 in 2003, up from 34 in 
2002). To improve the ability of the judicial system to deal 
with money laundering crimes, Brazilian authorities have 
created seven special federal-level money-laundering courts, 
one in each federal judicial district, and expect to create 
one more. The judges in these courts generally have received 
some specialized training to deal with money laundering 
cases. 
 
13.  Investigations into the scandal involving Banestado, 
the state bank of Parana, continued in 2004. In 1995, five 
banks in the tri-border region of Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Argentina, including Banestado, were authorized to open 
currency exchange accounts, known as CC-5 accounts. CC-5 
accounts quickly became used as a means of laundering money. 
Moneychangers opened hundreds of fake CC-5 accounts, into 
which criminals deposited millions of Reais. The money was 
then wired in dollars to the Banestado branch in New York 
City and from there to other banks, usually in countries 
considered to be tax havens. The moneychangers and Banestado 
officials took cuts from each transaction. Over 250 phony CC- 
5 accounts have been identified and it is suspected that as 
much as $30 billion passed through CC-5 Banestado accounts 
in the U.S. between 1996 and 1999, a portion of which was 
likely laundered.  A separate and sometimes politicized 
Congressional inquiry into the Banestado case was closed at 
end-2004; its final report recommended that law enforcement 
agencies indict several prominent figures in the case. 
 
14.  The COAF has responded to U.S. Government efforts to 
identify and block terrorist-related funds. Since September 
11, 2001, COAF has run inquiries and searched its financial 
records for entities and individuals on the UN 1267 
Sanctions Committee\'s consolidated list. None of the 
individuals and entities on the consolidated list were found 
to be operating or executing financial transactions in 
Brazil, and the GOB insists there is no evidence of 
terrorist financing in the country. The USG remains 
concerned, however, that the tri-border area with Argentina 
and Paraguay,  -- infamous for contraband of all kinds, 
including arms, drugs and pirated goods -- lacks adequate 
enforcement of currency controls and cross-border reporting 
requirements and may be a source of terrorist financing. In 
November 2003, the GOB extradited an alleged financier to 
Paraguay on charges of tax evasion. 
 
15.  The GOB has signed, but not yet ratified, the UN 
International Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism and the OAS Inter-American Convention 
on Terrorism. In 2000 Brazil became a full member of the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and a founding member of 
GAFISUD, the FATF for South America, and has sought to 
comply with the FATF Eight Special Recommendations on 
Terrorist Financing. Brazil is a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention and has signed, but not ratified, the UN 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which 
entered into force on September 29, 2003. On December 9, 
2003, the GOB signed the UN Convention Against Corruption, 
which is not yet in force internationally; Brazil also is a 
member of the OECD anti-bribery convention. Brazil is also a 
member of the Organization of American States Inter-American 
Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) Experts Group to 
Control Money Laundering. The COAF has been a member of the 
Egmont Group since 1999. In February 2001, the Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty between Brazil and the United States 
entered into force.  The Brazilian Senate ratified in 2004 a 
bilateral Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement with the U.S.

REF: SECSTATE 259661 
 
1.  Since the first Meeting of Parties to the Cartagena 
Protocol on Biosafety in February 2004, the GOB has 
introduced, but still not passed, legislation that 
would change regulatory practices concerning biosafety. 
Although, the bill is pro-GMO, it would reinforce 
existing labeling and documentation requirements. 
 
2.  Current Brazilian law maintains a threshold level 
of 1 percent for GMOs.  Products containing more than 1 
percent GMO should be labeled.  These standards, 
however, are rarely enforced.  If passed in its current 
form, this new legislation will maintain the 
requirement that food and food ingredients destined for 
human consumption be labeled as containing GMOs. 
 
3.  Comment:  The GOB is not likely to readdress this 
issue/bill until summer.  Post will update as more 
information becomes available. End Comment
