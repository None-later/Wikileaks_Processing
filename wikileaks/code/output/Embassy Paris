SUBJECT:  FRANCE ON SUDAN: SHOW US PROOF OF TERRORIST 
          SUPPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 277307 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  QUAI OFFICIALS STATE THEY ARE NOT FIRMLY 
CONVINCED OF SUDANESE SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, AND ASK 
FOR FIRMER PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF TRAINING CAMPS. 
THEY STRESS THAT THE POVERTY OF SUDAN, IN THEIR VIEW, 
PREVENTS IT FROM BEING A SUPPORTER OF TERRORISM IN THE 
FASHION OF A LIBYA OR AN IRAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
SUDANESE TOO POOR TO SUPPORT TERRORISM? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  QUAI DIRECTOR FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN AFRICAN 
AFFAIRS BERNADETTE LE FORT AND SUDAN DESKOFF RAJA RABIA 
TOLD VISITING INR TERRORISM ANALYST GINA BENNETT 
DECEMBER 8 THAT THE FRENCH BELIEVE THE SUDANESE LACK 
THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO SUPPORT TERRORISM.  LE FORT 
MENTIONED THAT IN THE PAST, TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE 
TYPICALLY HAD SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FROM A STATE, SUCH AS 
IRAN OR LIBYA, AND THAT SUDAN QUITE SIMPLY LACKED THE 
SAME SORT OF RESOURCES THAT THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE. 
 
4.  LE FORT SAID THE FRENCH HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE ARE 
UPWARDS OF 23 CAMPS AROUND KHARTOUM.  THEY ALSO 
UNDERSTAND THAT BIN LADEN, A SAUDI STRIPPED OF HIS 
CITIZENSHIP WHO IS STILL A PATRON TO SOME TERRORIST 
GROUPS, HAS A NUMBER OF SO-CALLED FARMS IN SOUTHERN 
SUDAN.  SHE ADDED THAT THE FRENCH DO NOT BELIEVE ANY 
SERIOUS \"MILITARY\" TRAINING WAS TAKING PLACE IN SUDAN. 
 
 
FRENCH FEEL SUDAN NOT AN \"ACTIVE\" SUPPORTER OF TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
5.  LE FORT SAID THAT FRANCE WAS CONCERNED BY THE 
\"SYMBOLIC MEANING\" OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM IN SUDAN 
TO SUBSAHARAN AFRICA, BUT HAD NO EVIDENCE THAT SUDAN IS 
\"ACTIVELY\" SUPPORTING TERRORISM.  \"WE FOLLOW SOME 
GROUPS CAREFULLY, AND WORRY MORE ABOUT THEIR MORAL 
INFLUENCE MORE THAN THEIR ACTIVE INFLUENCE,\" SHE SAID. 
SHE OPINED THAT MOST COUNTRIES TERRORISM PROBLEMS ARE 
HOMEGROWN, CITING ALGERIA AS AN EXAMPLE.  SHE ALSO 
MENTIONED SUDAN\'S PERMEABLE BORDERS AND SUGGESTED THERE 
MIGHT BE ACTIVITIES WITHIN SUDAN THAT ARE UNKNOWN TO 
ITS GOVERNMENT.  SHE SAID THAT FRANCE NEVERTHELESS 
REMAINS \"VERY FIRM\" IN ITS DEALINGS WITH THE SUDANESE 
GOVERNMENT.  RABIA MENTIONED SEPARATELY THAT THE GOF 
CONSIDERS TURABI \"DANGEROUS\", AND THAT FRANCE SHOULD IN 
NO WAY BE CONSIDERED A SUPPORTER OF THE SUDANESE 
GOVERNMENT. 
 
 
FRENCH ASK TO SEE EVIDENCE 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  LE FORT ASKED WHETHER THE USG HAS SPECIFIC EVIDENCE 
OF TRAINING OF HAMAS IN SUDAN, AND WHETHER THE USG 
COULD SHARE CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF 
TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS IN SUDAN.  RABIA MENTIONED 
THAT SUCH EVIDENCE WOULD BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO 
FRANCE DURING ITS PRESIDENCY OF THE EU. 
 
7.  WE RESPONDED THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS ANY 
LONGER THE CASE THAT TERRORIST GROUPS NEED A MAJOR 
STATE SPONSOR OR EVEN EASILY IDENTIFIABLE TRAINING 
CAMPS, IN ORDER TO TO CARRY OUT THEIR ACTIVITIES, 
CITING THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBERS AS EXAMPLES.  WE 
REITERATED THAT WE VIEWED THE HARBORING OF TERRORISTS 
AND PERMITTING THEM TO TRAIN IN SUDAN AS SUPPORT FOR 
TERRORISM.  WE SAID WE WOULD PASS ON THE FRENCH REQUEST 
TO SEE MORE CONCRETE EVIDENCE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  THIS IS THE FIRST SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION WE HAVE 
HAD IN RESPONSE TO OUR DEMARCHE ON TERRORISM IN SUDAN 
(REF).  WE AND THE FRENCH ARE SEEING SOME OF THE SAME 
FACTS (I.E. THE EXISTENCE OF CAMPS AND THE PRESENCE OF 
KNOWN TERRORISTS IN SUDAN), BUT ARE ASCRIBING DIFFERENT 
MEANINGS TO THEM.  THE FRENCH MAY HAVE MORE OF AN 
AGENDA IN SUDAN THAN THEY ARE WILLING TO SHARE WITH 
US.  ONE WELL-INFORMED NON-GOVERNMENT SOURCE SUGGESTS 
FRANCE WANTS TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH TURABI ET 
AL., IN THE HOPE OF USING SUDAN TO MODERATE ISLAMISTS 
IN ALGERIA.

SUBJECT: FRENCH VIEWS OF AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE 
 
REF: STATE 176819 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR SHARON WIENER 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C)  WE DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS TO FOREIGN MINISTER 
VEDRINE\'S OFFICE AND TO MFA AFGHAN DESK OFFICER BRUCE BOURDON 
ON OCTOBER 11 AND FOLLOWED-UP WITH A MEETING WITH BOURDON ON 
OCTOBER 12.  BOURDON TOLD US THAT THE FRENCH WERE ENGAGED IN 
DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR EU PARTNERS REGARDING AFGHANISTAN\'S 
POLITICAL FUTURE.  HE NOTED THESE DISCUSSIONS HAD BEEN 
STIMULATED IN PART BY FOREIGN MINISTER HUBERT VEDRINE\'S 
\"ACTION PLAN FOR AFGHANISTAN\".  HOWEVER, HE ADDED THAT THE 
FRENCH HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS, 
DOCUMENTS, OR PROPOSALS ABOUT WHERE TO GO NEXT IN AFGHANISTAN 
FROM THEIR EU PARTNERS.  BOURDON SAID THIS LACK OF RESPONSE 
WAS PROBABLY DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS: INSUFFICIENT TIME TO 
RESPOND, UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE DIRECTION THE WAR IN 
AFGHANISTAN WOULD TAKE, AND, THE CURRENT HEAVY TRAVEL 
SCHEDULE OF SENIOR MFA OFFICIALS.  BOURDON NOTED VEDRINE WAS 
VISITING ROME WHERE HE WILL BE MEETING WITH FORMER KING 
MOHAMMED ZAHIR SHAH, WHILE THE MFA\'S DIRECTOR FOR ASIA, 
DOMINIQUE GIRARD, IS VISITING WASHINGTON.  TONGUE IN CHEEK, 
BOURDON COMMENTED THAT GIVEN GIRARD\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON, IT 
WAS LIKELY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT FRANCE\'S 
POSITION ON AFGHANISTAN THAN HE WOULD.  BOURDON, HOWEVER, 
MADE CLEAR THAT IN TRYING TO DEVELOP A POSITION ON 
AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE, FRANCE WAS PAYING PARTICULAR 
ATTENTION TO THE OPINIONS OF THE GERMANS, BRITISH, AND 
ITALIANS.  THE FRENCH WILL LISTEN POLITELY TO OTHER EU 
MEMBERS, BUT IT IS THOSE THREE COUNTRIES WHO ARE MOST 
INVOLVED IN THE CRISIS AND CONTRIBUTING THE MOST FINANCIALLY. 
 
2.  (C)  BOURDON SAID HE DID NOT EXPECT ANYONE TO BE ABLE TO 
DEVELOP A COHERENT POSITION UNTIL THE COURSE OF THE WAR IN 
AFGHANISTAN BECAME A BIT CLEARER.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE 
FRENCH WERE WATCHING DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY TO SEE WHETHER THE 
TALIBAN COLLAPSED OR IF THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HANG ON TO 
POWER FOR SOME TIME.  WHILE THE FRENCH HOPE FOR A QUICK 
COLLAPSE AND A RAPID CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES, THERE IS SOME 
CONCERN THAT IN A WORST CASE, THE CONFLICT COULD DRAG ON 
THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR AND WELL INTO 2002.  BOURDON 
NOTED THE FRENCH WERE ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON PAKISTANI 
BEHAVIOR TOWARDS AFGHANISTAN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE EXPLAINED 
THAT THE FRENCH WERE UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN WOULD ALLOW THE TALIBAN TO CRUMBLE, OR WHETHER THE 
GOP, OR A ROGUE ELEMENT OF THE GOP, WOULD FIND SOME MEANS TO 
PROVIDE COVERT SUPPORT TO THE TALIBAN.  UNSURE ABOUT WHAT 
COMES NEXT, THE FRENCH NEVERTHELESS BELIEVE THE GOP NEEDS TO 
BE INVOLVED IN DECISIONS RELATING TO AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE AND 
THAT IT IS CRUCIAL TO FIND AFGHAN PASHTUNS WHO CAN PLAY A 
PROMINENT ROLE. 
 
3.  (C)  BOURDON SAID THE FRENCH BELIEVED FORMER KING 
MOHAMMED ZAHIR SHAH WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO PLAY A VERY LIMITED 
ROLE.  HE MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE IMPETUS TO START A 
DIALOGUE, LOYA JIRGA, BUT HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THINGS 
HIMSELF.  THE FRENCH ALSO BELIEVE WE, WESTERN COUNTRIES, 
SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO NOT TRY TO IMPOSE ANY DECISIONS FROM THE 
OUTSIDE.  THERE MIGHT BE A SMALL SUPERVISORY ROLE FOR THE 
UNITED NATIONS, BUT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY EFFORT TO DEPLOY 
A LARGER-SCALE UN MISSION A LA KOSOVO OR EAST TIMOR.  A LARGE 
UN MISSION SIMPLY WOULD NOT WORK AND IT WOULD QUICKLY BECOME 
IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVIDE ANY KIND OF SECURITY FOR A LARGE UN 
MISSION.  THE FRENCH SEE THE UN\'S ROLE AS MINIMAL, SIMPLY 
BEING A PRESENCE TO URGE FOLLOW-UP TO DECISIONS MADE BY 
AFGHANS. 
 
4.  (C)  WHEN ASKED ABOUT VEDRINE\'S OCTOBER 10 MEETING WITH 
LAKHDAR BRAHIMI, BOURDON (PLEASE PROTECT) REPLIED THAT 
VEDRINE WAS \"UP TO HIS USUAL TRICKS\".  HE EXPLAINED THE 
VEDRINE-BRAHIMI MEETING HAD BEEN A \"TETE-A-TETE\" AND VEDRINE 
DID NOT BOTHER TO BRIEF ANYONE IN THE MFA ABOUT THEIR 
CONVERSATION.  BOURDON SAID THE ONLY THING HE KNEW CAME FROM 
ONE OF VEDRINE\'S PROTOCOL OFFICERS WHO ESCORTED BRAHIMI TO 
THE MEETING.  THE PROTOCOL OFFICER SAID BRAHIMI EXPRESSED THE 
VIEW THAT PAKISTAN WOULD NEED TO PLAY A ROLE IN REACHING AN 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND ZAHIR SHAH\'S 
SUPPORTERS.  BRAHIMI ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY 
FOR THE PERSONNEL OF UN AGENCIES AND NGOS AFTER THE \"U.S. 
DOES ITS JOB\".  BRAHIMI SAID HE SAW NO WAY TO PREVENT 
INSTABILITY AND HAD NO SUGGESTIONS REGARDING HOW TO CHANGE 
THIS.  A MEMBER OF FM VEDRINE\'S STAFF ADDED THAT BRAHIMI TOLD 
VEDRINE THAT HE WAS APPROCHING HIS NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WITH 
\"NO PRECONCEPTIONS.\"

1.  (C) DURING AN AUGUST 7 MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER 
VILLEPIN\'S CABINET DIRECTOR PIERRE VIMONT ON A RANGE OF 
ISSUES, CHARGE ASKED DIRECTLY WHETHER FRANCE HAD NEGOTIATED 
WITH THE FARC IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE THE RELEASE OF 
FRENCH-COLOMBIAN CITIZEN INGRID BETANCOURT.  VIMONT 
EXPLICITLY DENIED THAT THERE HAD BEEN ANY GOF CONTACT WITH 
THE FARC.  HE SAID THE FRENCH DISPATCH OF A C-130 AIRCRAFT TO 
MANAUS, BRAZIL HAD BEEN A PURELY HUMANITARIAN MISSION CARRIED 
OUT AT THE REQUEST OF BETANCOURT\'S FAMILY, WHO HAD HAD 
INDICATIONS THAT THE FARC WAS ON THE POINT OF RELEASING 
INGRID. 
 
2.  (C) VIMONT DESCRIBED A SUCCESSION OF EVENTS THAT HAD 
CAUSED THE GOF TO TAKE A DECISION TO ATTEMPT TO BE HELPFUL TO 
THE BETANCOURT FAMILY, IF POSSIBLE.  ACCORDING TO VIMONT, AT 
SOME POINT BEFORE THE EARLY JULY DISPATCH OF THE FRENCH C-130 
TO MANAUS, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE BETANCOURT FAMILY 
RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT INGRID BETANCOURT WOULD BE RELEASED 
BY THE FARC DUE TO HEALTH CONCERNS.  COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT 
URIBE, WHO, WITH HIS MILITARY STAFF, REPORTEDLY CONSIDERED AN 
ASSAULT TO FREE BETANCOURT, WAS URGED BY THE BETANCOURT 
FAMILY TO AVOID AN ATTACK AND TO LET THEM TRY ANOTHER OPTION 
TO RETRIEVE INGRID.  THE FAMILY THEN CAME TO THE GOF WITH A 
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE, HOPING TO FLY INGRID OUT OF BRAZIL 
AFTER THE FARC HAD RELEASED HER TO THEM.  VIMONT SAID THAT 
VILLEPIN HAD NOTIFIED THE URIBE GOVERNMENT OF THIS AS THE 
OPERATION WAS UNDER WAY, AND THAT THE GOC HAD SUBSEQUENTLY 
MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE REASONS FOR THE FRENCH 
INITIATIVE AND ITS HUMANITARIAN NATURE (\"WE ALSO HAVE OUR 
PROBLEMS FROM THE BETANCOURT FAMILY\"). 
 
3.  (C) VIMONT SAID THAT THE BRAZILIAN PRESS HAD MADE THREE 
ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING THE AFFAIR: A) THAT FRANCE HAD BEEN 
PREPARED TO PAY A RANSOM FOR BETANCOURT\'S RELEASE; B) THAT 
THERE HAD BEEN ARMS ABOARD THE PLANE; AND, C) THAT FRANCE HAD 
TAKEN OUT A FARC COMMANDER ON THE PLANE FOR MEDICAL 
TREATMENT.  VIMONT SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY INVOLVED 
IN THE PLANNING OF THE MISSION AND HE CATEGORICALLY DENIED 
ALL THREE ALLEGATIONS.  HE SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN FOUR 
EMPTY SEATS ON THE PLANE, BUT THESE HAD BEEN INTENDED FOR 
INGRID, HER SISTER, A PRIEST WHO ACTED AS INTERMEDIARY FOR 
THE FAMILY, AND INGRID BETANCOURT\'S FORMER PRESIDENTIAL 
CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

SUBJECT: TITLE III LIBERTAD ACT WAIVER: FRANCE 
 
REF: STATE 135512 
 
Classified By: A/DCM SHARON WIENER FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  In response to reftel, we met June 24 with 
the MFA Cuba Desk Officer, who noted that France had been 
sharply critical of Cuba\'s human rights record bilaterally 
and as an EU member.  Even before Havana unilaterally refused 
EU and French assistance, France had reevaluated its position 
on aid to Cuba and severely restricted and restructured 
programs so that they would focus on those that most 
benefited the populace rather than Castro,s regime.  A 
failure to waive Title III of the Libertad Act for France 
would be harmful to our overall bilateral relations and could 
have a negative effect on relations with the EU.  End Summary. 
 
 
France Through the EU 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (U) In a June 24 meeting, French MFA Cuba desk officer 
Eric Chaux stressed that the United States and France shared 
the common goal of a democratic Cuba with a government that 
respects human rights and individual freedoms.  France holds 
to the common EU position on Cuba, adopted by the EU Council 
of Ministers in December 1996.  This decision makes the 
conclusion of an EU cooperation agreement with Cuba 
conditional upon Havana initiating democratic reforms, 
protecting human rights, and introducing political freedoms. 
In response to Cuba\'s arrest of 75 dissidents in March 2003 
and reinstatement of the death penalty, France, along with 
the other members of the European Union, condemned the abuse 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms in a June 5, 2003 
declaration.  In addition, the EU imposed penalties against 
Cuba, including limiting bilateral high-level governmental 
 
visits and announcing an intention to invite Cuban dissidents 
to national day celebrations.  France subsequently invited a 
number of dissidents to the July 14, 2003 Bastille Day 
celebration in Havana.  As a result of the June 5 
declaration, Cuba declined to accept any aid from the EU. 
The EU reaffirmed its position in regards to Cuba and the 
previously imposed restrictions in its statement of June 14, 
2004. 
 
France Bilaterally 
---------------------- 
 
3.  (C) In May 2003, France reevaluated its bilateral 
assistance to Cuba.  The result was a decision to concentrate 
cooperation only in those areas where it would most benefit 
the general populace, notably health, agriculture, 
professional development, the environment, and scientific 
research.  Additionally, France suspended, among others, its 
bilateral police and judicial program.  These actions 
triggered a backlash in Havana, much like the reaction 
triggered by the June 5 EU declaration.  French actions 
resulted in Cuba unilaterally refusing French assistance and 
severing negotiations on new programs.  Castro has also cut 
official contact between the GOC and the French Embassy in 
Havana.  Most recently, France voted with the United States 
to condemn the human rights situation in Cuba in a close 22 
to 21 vote April 15 at the 60th Session of the UN Commission 
on Human Rights. 
 
French Concerns About Title III Impact 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) In a conversation subsequent to the June 24 meeting, 
Chaux indicated to PolOff that he had spoken to colleagues in 
other EU countries about the Title III Libertad Act and the 
 
country-specific assessment process.  He expressed concern 
about the possible impact of non-renewal of the Title III 
waiver on French and other EU members.  He requested in-depth 
and high level consultations in advance of a final USG Title 
III waiver decision in regards to France.  He also indicated 
that EU members would likely meet to discuss the possibility 
of Title III implementation. 
 
Title III Waiver Recommended for France 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
6.  (C) Comment:  France, both bilaterally and through 
multilateral channels, has reacted strongly to Cuba\'s spring 
2003 crackdown on dissidents.  Imposition of Title III of the 
Libertad Act against France could have a number of negative 
effects on our relations with the GOF at a time when we are 
looking for French support in a number of critical areas. 
Granting a waiver would be in the U.S. national interest in 
order to maintain strong cooperation with France inter alia 
in promoting support for human rights and democratic 
transition in Cuba, on Haiti, and on counter-terrorism. 
Therefore, we strongly recommend that a Title III waiver be 
issued for France.  At a minimum, we should take seriously 
the French request for high-level consultations before a 
Title III waiver is ruled out.  End Comment.

Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Paul Mailhot for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: The GOF shares USG goals of facilitating a 
transition towards democracy, supporting Cuban Civil society, 
and preparing for a post-dictatorship Cuba.  The GOF, French 
public, and NGOs, however, are critical of the US embargo of 
Cuba.  France\'s Cuba policy remains anchored in the EU common 
position.  To be most effective, a USG initiative should be 
cast as an effort to initiate a dialogue with the EU -- in 
capitals and in Brussels -- on possible joint action.  French 
NGOs, several currently engaged with Cuban civil society, are 
more likely to respond to overtures from US-based NGOs than 
from the USG. End Summary. 
 
---- 
GOF 
---- 
 
2.  (U) The GOF holds to the common EU position on Cuba, 
adopted by the EU Council of Ministers in December 1996.  In 
response to Cuba\'s arrest of 75 dissidents in March 2003 and 
reinstatement of the death penalty, France, along with the 
other members of the European Union, condemned the abuse of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms and instituted a number 
of sanctions in a June 5, 2003 declaration and reaffirmed its 
position in regards to Cuba and the previously imposed 
restrictions in its statement of June 14, 2004.  In observing 
these restrictions, France has, among other things, invited a 
number of dissidents to the July 14, 2003 Bastille Day 
celebration in Havana.  A May 2003 reevaluation and 
redistribution of its bilateral assistance to Cuba resulted 
in Havana unilaterally refusing French assistance and 
severing negotiations on new programs.  Castro has also cut 
official contact between the GOC and the French Embassy in 
Havana.  Most recently, France and other EU member states 
voted with the United States to condemn the human rights 
situation in Cuba in a close 22 to 21 vote April 15 at the 
60th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. 
 
3.  (U) The mayors of Strasbourg and Paris have both 
supported the twinning of libraries in France with 
independent libraries in Cuba through the Support Group for 
the Independent Libraries (Paris). 
 
----- 
NGOs 
----- 
 
4.  (U) There are a number of French NGOs very active in 
promoting human rights and the peaceful transition toward 
democracy in Cuba.  Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters 
Without Borders) has sharply criticized the regime in Havana, 
calling Castro a \"predator of press freedom\" and labeling 
Cuba as \"the world\'s biggest prison for journalists.\"   They 
have actively encouraged European parliamentarians to sign a 
\"Brussels Declaration\" in which they undertake to constantly 
petition the Cuban government for the release of the 75 
dissidents arrested in March 2003 and to call on the 
\"European Commission and Council to pursue policies 
consistent with this goal.\"  Reporters Without Borders has 
also launched a campaign aimed at discouraging the 
approximately 800,000 European tourists who visit Cuba each 
year, employing the slogan, \"Cuba Si, Castro No.\" 
 
5.  (U) The Free Cuba Solidarity Collective is made up of 
representatives from several other NGOs operating out of 
France, including Action Droits de l,Homme, Free Cuba 
European Association, and the Third Cuban Republic 
Association.  They organize a weekly protest in front of the 
Cuban Embassy in Paris and arranged a meeting in April 
between members of the French National Assembly and Cuban 
dissidents in Paris to thank the representatives for their 
solidarity in sponsoring 79 Cuban political prisoners. 
 
---------- 
Assessment 
---------- 
 
6.  (C) Comment: There is support in France for the promotion 
of human rights and democratic development in a post-Castro 
Cuba, but there is also a widespread public view that the US 
embargo of Cuba makes life more difficult for the average 
Cuban without materially changing Castro-regime policy.  This 
view is shared at the policy level in the GOF, and is also 
reflected in the EU common policy on Cuba, to which France 
will continue to adhere.  To be most effective, a USG 
approach seeking to encourage greater activism in support of 
Cuban opposition groups and to exert greater pressure on the 
Castro regime to respect human rights should be cast as a 
 
desire to dialogue with the EU -- in capitals and in Brussels 
-- to explore possible joint measures.  There is also scope 
for discussion with key Parliamentarians about how to best 
support the cause of human rights and democratic transition 
in Cuba.  Several active NGOs exist in France that currently 
coordinate efforts with some members of Cuban civil society. 
These NGOs share the public and official criticism of the US 
embargo of Cuba, and would therefore be more receptive to 
suggestions for joint efforts coming from US-based NGOs than 
from the USG.  End Comment.

Classified By: POL M/C JOSIAH ROSENBLATT FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D 
 
1.  (SBU) Emboffs met July 23 at the unions\' request with 
Michele Simonnin, of the trade union Workers\' Strength 
(CGT-FO) and Philippe Selva of the General Confederation of 
Workers (CGT), two of the three largest labor unions in 
France, to discuss US foreign policy regarding Venezuela. 
The labor representatives presented Laboff and Poloff with a 
French translation of labor declarations from organizations 
in Brazil and Peru critical of US \"interference\" in Venezuela 
that seemed to have been specifically edited for their 
meeting with Emboffs (faxed to WHA/AND).  The labor 
representatives opened by expressing concern for Venezuelan 
sovereignty, and posing two questions:  why had the U.S. 
Congress been holding discussions on \"internal Venezuelan 
matters,\" and why was the USG (sic) financing the August 15 
referendum? 
 
2. (SBU)  Poloffs clarified the first point by providing the 
context of WHA A/S Roger Noriega\'s June 24 remarks to the 
Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western 
Hemisphere.  Ms. Simonnin appeared to have been at least 
marginally reassured to learn that A/S Noriega\'s remarks had 
been made as part of the normal discussions that exist 
between Department of State officials and the Congress 
concerning U.S. foreign policy.  Emboffs addressed the second 
point by explaining the status of the National Endowment for 
Democracy and its funding process, but the visitors remained 
skeptical of NED motives.  Poloffs reviewed USG policy, 
noting multilateral support for OAS Resolution 833, our 
desire to see an open and transparent referendum next month 
and our support for OAS and Carter Center observers. 
 
3.  (SBU) In discussing USG policy, the labor representatives 
seemed more focused on an ideal regarding Venezuelan 
sovereignty than the complex realities of international 
relations.  They attempted to twist Emboffs\' statements, 
asking several times whether the USG considered the Chavez 
government legitimate and questioning the degradation of 
U.S.-Venezuelan relations.  Emboffs explained USG policy, and 
said the USG strives for good relations with Venezuela, as 
evidenced by the encouraging tone of A/S Noriega\'s comments. 
 
4. (C) Comment.  The two union representatives genuinely 
seemed to believe the USG had taken the first steps in a 
scenario likely to lead to a military invasion of Venezuela 
to protect the interests of U.S. oil companies and/or 
consumers.  They alluded to supposed indicators, e.g., \"the 
history of U.S. involvement in overthrowing democratically 
elected Latin American governments,\" and  \"the invasion of 
Iraq because of U.S. oil interests.\"  Although the visitors 
were pleased to have had a chance to present their concerns, 
the force of their misconceptions was striking.  End comment.

SUBJECT: \"J,ACCUSE:\" SHARON COMMENTS SPARK QUESTIONS 
REGARDING FRENCH JEWISH MIGRATION 
 
 
Classified By: CHARGE ALEX WOLFF FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary and comment: Israeli PM Ariel Sharon\'s July 
18 call for Jews to emigrate from France to Israel  \"as early 
as possible\" in order to escape the \"wildest anti-Semitism\" 
touched off a barrage of criticism from both the GoF and 
French Jewish community.  Although Sharon had qualified his 
statements by noting that the GoF was taking steps to combat 
anti-Semitism, and Israeli officials diluted the message to 
indicate that it was part of a worldwide message for all Jews 
to migrate to Israel, the furious reaction to Sharon\'s speech 
demonstrated just how sensitive the issue of anti-Semitism, 
and its link to the broader question of Muslim integration, 
is in France.  Numerous French press reports on the 
controversy noted that the numbers of French Jews migrating 
to Israel doubled between 2001 and 2002/3 but remain within 
the \"normal\" historical range for France.  A June Jewish 
Agency survey reportedly indicated that over 30,000 of 
France\'s 600,000 Jews planned to immigrate to Israel \"in the 
near future.\"  We do not currently expect Jewish emigration 
to reach anywhere near such levels, but unease in the Jewish 
community is pervasive, to the point that unsettling events 
over a sustained period could spark a significant departure 
of Jews from the country.  End summary and comment. 
 
2.  (SBU) July 18 comments by PM Sharon that French Jews 
should emigrate to Israel \"as early as possible\" to escape 
the \"wildest anti-Semitism\" sparked a firestorm of criticism 
from senior GoF officials, French Jewish religious and 
community leaders, and politicians from across the political 
spectrum.  Subsequent GoI explanations that Sharon\'s remarks 
were taken out of context and part of a general appeal to 
Jews worldwide failed to temper widespread indignation in 
France.  Both local Israeli Embassy and MFA officials told us 
Sharon\'s remarks were perceived by the GoF as an attack on 
President Chirac, which explained the \"overreaction\" on the 
French side.  In response, Chirac\'s Diplomatic Adviser 
Maurice Gourdault-Montagne demarched the Israeli Embassy to 
declare that Sharon would not be invited to France either now 
or in the foreseeable future, while FM Barnier called 
publicly for an official explanation (which was never 
forthcoming) and decried Sharon\'s statement as \"intolerable\" 
and \"unacceptable.\" 
 
3.  (C)  The MFA DAS for Israeli/Palestinian/Levant Affairs 
Christian Jouret later told us that he found both Sharon\'s 
remarks and the French reaction \"insufferable.\"   He also 
opined that Sharon may have viewed France as an easy target 
before a largely American audience.  Israeli Embassy 
Political Counselor Ella Aphek, meanwhile, stressed to us the 
inadvertent nature of Sharon\'s remarks, which she said 
nonetheless had destroyed the modest progress in 
French-Israeli relations achieved since the successful visit 
of Israeli President Katsav to Paris last February.  The GoF 
was eventually mollified by July 29 remarks by PM Sharon, 
who, while welcoming a group of some 200 new immigrants from 
France, paid tribute to Chirac\'s efforts to combat 
anti-Semitism.  The MFA, in response, noted Sharon\'s remarks 
\"with satisfaction\" and announced that FM Barnier would 
likely visit Israel in October.   Although this latest crisis 
in French-Israeli relations appears to have subsided, it has 
re-fixed attention on the recent increase in French Jewish 
migration to Israel, and its causes. 
 
4.  (U) Since its creation in 1948, nearly 70,000 Jews have 
immigrated to Israel from France.  Recent annual numbers show 
a two-fold increase in migration between 2001 (1,007) and 
2002 (2,035), with 2003,s figure (2,086) very close to the 
previous year.  Press accounts have attributed this increase 
to a similar rise in anti-Semitic attacks since late 2000 
when the second Palestinian Intifada began.  When put into 
context, however, comparable increases in these numbers can 
be seen throughout the 56-year history of Israel.  Larger 
numbers of immigrants left France, possibly in response to 
the 1967 Six Day War, in 1968 (2,526), 1969 (5,292), 1970 
(4,414), 1971 (3,281), and 1972 (2,356).  Jewish emigration 
from France leveled off for several years, averaging between 
1,300-1,400 annual departures, before spiking again in 1982 
(2,094).  The 1990s, too, saw a dramatic increase in 
migrants, with numbers rising as high as 1,870 in 1996 and 
1,938 in 1997  which France\'s Ambassador to Israel Gerard 
Araud publicly attributed to post-Oslo \"golden years\" -- 
before declining to a relatively low figure of 1,007 in 2001, 
just prior to the most recent escalation.  Recent numbers 
indicate that 687 French Jews migrated to Israel from January 
through June of 2004.  (Note: Reports differ in criteria and 
statistics regarding Jewish immigration to Israel.  The most 
comprehensive statistics available are based on information 
from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics.  End note.) 
 
5.  (U) More significant than the precise number of French 
Jews migrating to Israel is their reasons for emigrating. 
 
 
Media interviews with newly arrived French immigrants 
indicate that most go to Israel for \"positive,\" i.e. 
religious or Zionist, reasons.  Reference, however, is often 
made to anti-Semitism in France, though not as the primary 
reason for emigration.  Financial incentives, increased in 
January 2002 to allow French Jews to benefit from the highest 
levels of immigrant aid, may have also contributed to the 
recent increase.  In July, the Jewish Agency\'s Paris 
representatives met with Israeli authorities to determine how 
best to capitalize on its June poll that indicated 30,000 
Jews in France expressed what was variously reported as 
willingness or desire to emigrate to Israel.  As a result, 
\"hundreds of envoys\" will reportedly be sent to France by the 
Jewish Agency especially to those areas with high Muslim 
populations, and further incentives for immigrants are to be 
developed for French Jews. 
 
6.  (SBU) The rise in anti-Semitic attacks in France is real. 
 The first six months of 2004 saw 510 such acts, as opposed 
to 593 for the entire year in 2003.  While the government has 
vigorously condemned such attacks in public and taken steps 
to address the issue, including increased police presence at 
Jewish institutions, harsher sentences for those who commit 
racist or anti-Semitic crimes, and programs aimed at 
combating anti-Semitism in schools, the real roots of the 
problem -- poor integration of the Muslim community in France 
and the extrapolation of the Middle East conflict -- still 
remain. 
 
7.  (U) The intense backlash against Sharon\'s comments, 
particularly by the Jewish community in France, would suggest 
that most French Jews believe that the GoF is serious in 
addressing the rise in anti-Semitism and see their future in 
France as secure.  Jewish leaders have been notably 
supportive of recent government actions taken to address the 
rise in anti-Semitic attacks.  A member from the 
Representative Council of Jewish Institutions (CRIF), the 
most powerful political organization of the Jewish community 
in France, stated that the Jewish community \"knows that the 
political class is doing all it can to fight against 
anti-Semitism.\" 
 
8.  (SBU) Comment: CRIF pronouncements aside, we sense a 
greater pessimism in the French Jewish community at large. 
In the view of many, good intentions on the part of the GoF 
may not, over time, suffice in the face of a growing and 
increasingly radicalized Muslim population (which is only 
encouraged by France\'s continuing, harsh criticism of GoI 
policies).  Rising anxiety may not yet have tipped the 
migration statistics in a significant way, but anecdotal 
evidence suggests that many French Jews have made provisions 
for a future move.  We understand that purchases of homes in 
Israel by families still residing in France has risen in the 
last few years, and we even hear of families where 
breadwinners divide their time between the two countries as 
part of a gradual shift out of France.   Also not captured by 
the emigration figures cited above is the departure of 
French Jews to other destinations, notably the U.S. and 
Canada.  In all, the picture is one of a steady and rising 
level of departures, and the strong possibility of a 
significant outflow if the confidence of Western Europe\'s 
largest Jewish community continues to erode.  End Comment.

(D) 
 
1.  (C) PolOff met with MFA Venezuelan desk officer Hedi 
Picquart on August 9 and delivered demarche as per reftel. 
Picquart noted that France had hoped EU international 
election observers would participate in the August 15 
referendum vote.  Unfortunately, the GoV-imposed restrictions 
were deemed unacceptable, as they were not up to EU standard 
methodology and would prohibit credible observation.  The GOF 
fully supports the OAS and Carter Center observer missions, 
as outlined in the August 3 EU declaration.  According to 
Picquart, the GOF will neither encourage nor prevent French 
citizens from observing the elections through other 
organizations, but they do so as private individuals and not 
representatives of the GOF.  The French mission in Caracas 
will closely follow all activities surrounding the 
referendum, and diplomatic personnel there have postponed 
traditional August vacations to remain in place. 
 
2.  (U) Two opinion pieces written by French academics have 
recently appeared in the left-of-center daily \"Liberation\" on 
opposing sides of the referendum vote.  The pro-Chavez 
article praises the President\'s reforms addressing social 
inequality and injustice in the country, claiming he is a 
modern-day Bolivar who, like his predecessor, is carrying 
forth the ideals of the French Revolution in South America. 
Washington, the authors assert, will claim any loss by the 
opposition as interference on the part of Chavez, thus giving 
Uncle Sam the right to intervene.  The anti-Chavez article 
draws attention to the problems that have persisted or 
increased under the Chavez administration - high unemployment 
rates and a quadrupling of the price of petroleum - and 
rebuts the argument that the opposition is comprised solely 
of oligarchs and rich elite, claiming many among the left 
also support the referendum.   Post will continue to monitor 
the French media as the referendum approaches and Paris PD is 
prepared to utilize the press points in reftel as 
appropriate.

SUBJECT: FRENCH CEMETERY DESECRATIONS AND LINK TO EXTREME 
RIGHT 
 
REF: PARIS 5906 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: France has seen a rash of hate crimes 
resulting in the desecration of nearly 400 Jewish and Muslim 
tombs since the beginning of the year.  Most recently, 56 
Jewish graves were painted with neo-Nazi symbols and 
xenophobic slogans in Lyon on August 8, although recent 
developments in this case raised questions about the motives 
behind an apparently obvious anti-Semitic hate crime.  The 
previous week, 15 Muslim tombs in Strasbourg were vandalized 
with neo-Nazi graffiti.  The GOF immediately and forcefully 
denounced both desecrations at the highest levels; however, 
those affected seem dissatisfied with mere condemnations in 
light of continued incidents.  These latest acts further 
validate what the Minister of Interior in May called \"a 
resurgence -- notably among some youths -- of neo-Nazi 
ideology fed by hatred and ignorance.\"  End summary. 
 
2.  (U) On the night of August 5, in a military cemetery in 
Strasbourg, the graves of 15 Muslim soldiers killed in the 
liberation of eastern France were defiled.  The tombs were 
painted with swastikas, SS signs, and the acronym \"HVE 
junior,\" making reference to the neo-Nazi organization known 
as the Alsatian Patriotic Association (\"Heimattreue 
Vereinigung Elsass,\" in German) which was banned in 1993 for 
anti-Semitic crimes.  (Note: Five other headstones -- four 
Muslim and one Jewish -- were previously desecrated in the 
same cemetery in April.  End note.)  French and foreign media 
have begun to highlight the rise of xenophobia and 
neo-Nazism, particularly in Alsace, an area that includes 
Strasbourg and has historically been passed back and forth 
between France and Germany. 
 
3.  (U) Also on August 5, an individual identifying himself 
as \"Phineas\" claimed responsibility for an attack in the town 
of Villeurbanne, near Lyon, on a person of North African 
origin that left the victim hospitalized.  During the night 
of August 8, three days after the attack in Villeurbanne, 56 
graves in a Jewish cemetery in Lyon were scrawled with 
swastikas, Celtic crosses, and slogans glorifying Hitler and, 
incongruously, proclaiming \"resistance to the Islamic 
invasion.\"  In addition, the name \"Phineas\" was painted in 
several places and a hatchet found at the cemetery was linked 
through DNA analysis to the Villeurbanne attack, leading 
police to suspect the two attacks were related. 
 
4.  (U) On August 15, a 25 year-old recently unemployed 
Frenchman turned himself in to a police commissariat in 
Paris, alleging to be the \"Phineas\" responsible for both 
incidents.  Claiming that he had been \"persecuted,\" the 
suspect indicated that he decided to \"react against the 
Islamic invasion.\"  The man in custody, recently identified 
as Michael Tronchon, stated that after the attack in 
Villeurbanne, he desecrated the Jewish graves in Lyon, 
including painting the phrase \"resistance to the Islamic 
invasion,\" in order to obtain a greater \"audience.\" 
According to media accounts, \"Phineas\" considered the French 
extreme right too weak and reportedly decided to act out on 
his own, inspired by a documentary on U.S. neo-Nazi groups. 
(Note: The name \"Phineas,\" has been associated with 
right-wing anti-Semitic and racist violence in the U.S., 
including the deaths of 11 people involved in biracial 
relationships between 1970 and 1980 and the 1999 attack on a 
Los Angeles Jewish community center. End note.) 
 
5.  (U) The GOF reacted quickly to the Lyon and Strasbourg 
desecrations.  Justice Minister Dominique Perben visited the 
Lyon site while President Chirac condemned the \"vile 
profanation\" and Prime Minister Raffarin called the attack 
odious.  Similarly, Interior Minister de Villepin \"condemned 
with the greatest resolution\" the Strasbourg attack and 
Chirac, in an open letter to the head of the Muslim council 
in Strasbourg, proclaimed his \"absolute determination to 
fight this plague.\"  However, this did not appear to appease 
leaders of both the Muslim and Jewish communities.  According 
to the Chief Rabbi of Lyon, Richard Wertschlag, \"a crackdown 
is needed to make these people realize the consequence of 
their acts.\"  Similarly, the rector of the Strasbourg mosque, 
Abdellah Boussouf, stated emphatically, \"I can no longer be 
content now with the condemnations and solidarity pledges of 
political rulers.  I want results.  France\'s Muslims as a 
whole have the feeling they are considered second-class 
citizens.\" 
 
6.  (SBU) Comment: The fact that many of the recent cemetery 
desecrations have involved the tombs of soldiers or monuments 
in honor of those who died in World War II have led some in 
the media to speculate that the attacks may be related to the 
60th anniversary of the battles that liberated France from 
Nazi occupation.  However, the early reports concerning the 
suspected perpetrator of the Lyon desecration seems to 
indicate that he used the attack on the Jewish cemetery to 
gain further attention for his own anti-Islamic agenda. 
Before the arrest of \"Phineas,\" Israeli Embassy contacts had 
 
 
attributed the cemetery desecrations to a rising neo-Nazi 
extremist minority, which has added to a general unease in 
France\'s Jewish community (see reftel).  Even if it turns out 
that the motive in Lyon was actually anti-Islamic, Jewish 
anxiety is still justified in light of numerous other 
cemetery attacks and, most recently, the August 14 discovery 
of graffiti declaring \"Death to Jews\" on a part of the Notre 
Dame Cathedral in Paris.  Whether these recent attacks are 
part of a larger resurgence in the extreme right -- including 
both traditional neo-Nazis and other anti-Semitic, 
anti-Islamic, racist, and xenophobic elements -- remains to 
be seen.  For its part, the GOF has attempted in recent 
months to combat racism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia in a 
number of ways, including establishing new educational 
curriculum aimed at combating bigotry in school-aged 
children, hosting an OSCE conference on the connection 
between such crimes and the Internet in June, and announcing 
in July the formation of a special Ministry of Interior 
project to combat cyberterror.  However, it is evident that, 
while the GOF is both public and vociferous in its 
condemnations of such acts, those who are victims want to see 
more in the way of results.  End comment.

(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Jeanne de Tarle, 
MFA UN Desk Officer covering the Caribbean; Eric Chaux, MFA 
Cuba Desk Officer; and Christophe Katsahian, U.S. Desk 
Officer, on October 13.  De Tarle underlined that the GOF 
shared our overall assessment of the human rights situation 
in Cuba.  She added that France follows the human rights 
situation closely and would continue to do so, but that 
France\'s history of voting for the resolution against the 
embargo was unlikely to change.  De Tarle emphasized that an 
affirmative vote on the resolution was not a show of support 
for the Castro regime, but rather a position taken on 
principle, and, she said, the GOF considers the embargo an 
ineffective way of bringing about democratic change in Cuba. 
While it is probable that the GOF will vote with other EU 
countries in support of the resolution, de Tarle indicated 
that there would likely be a strongly worded Explanation of 
Vote to voice EU concern with the continued human rights 
abuses of the Castro regime.

while France is concerned with the state of human rights in 
Venezuela, it does not share our sense of urgency and 
considers it too early to make any public statements on the 
subject.  Piquart stated that the GOF believes the creation 
and implementation of laws is an internal affair.  However, 
if legislation is applied in ways that infringe on human 
rights, the GOF would voice its opposition.  Arbitrary 
arrests, disproportionate punishments, or utilizing the 
censorship law in a way that restricts freedom of the press 
would be clear violations of human rights, Piquart stated, 
and would merit GOF and EU reaction.  However, GOF or EU 
statements at this point, Piquart said, would be \"premature.\"

SUBJECT: TENSION IN TAHITI AS POLITICAL STRUGGLE PLAYS OUT 
IN POLYNESIA, PARIS 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Paul Mailhot, for reasons 1.4 
 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: Political turmoil, confusion, and charges 
of corruption reign in Papeete and Paris as both Oscar Temaru 
and Gaston Flosse claim to be the legitimate president of 
French Polynesia in the aftermath of an October 9 vote of 
censure and subsequent October 22 vote for president in the 
Polynesian Assembly.  Temaru, ousted in the censure vote, 
launched a \"spiritual fast\" on October 26 along with several 
dozen supporters, all of whom have refused to vacate the 
presidential palace.  Flosse declared himself the legitimate 
president of French Polynesia based on an October 22 
parliamentary vote boycotted by Temaru\'s party.  Over 10,500 
miles away in Paris, French President Jacques Chirac, a 
long-time Flosse ally, has thus far ignored calls from the 
opposition -- and even some from the center-right -- to 
dissolve the Polynesian Assembly and hold new elections.  The 
current situation in French Polynesia remains peaceful; 
however, some in France, mindful of the riots that gripped 
the archipelago following the 1995 decision by Paris to 
resume nuclear testing in the islands, eye events in the 
South Pacific cautiously.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) The roots of the current crisis lie in the May 23 
Polynesian Parliamentary elections, which saw Oscar Temaru\'s 
coalition win a one-seat majority in the Assembly (29 of the 
57 seats), wrenching control away from Gaston Flosse, who had 
been president of French Polynesia for 16 of the last 19 
years.  Temaru\'s coalition includes many who favor 
independence or at least more autonomy from France and is 
supported by the Socialist Party (PS) in metropolitan France. 
 Flosse, who is a senator in Chirac\'s UMP party and a 
longtime ally of the president, strongly advocates remaining 
within the French fold.  Temaru was ousted as president when 
members of his coalition defected, allowing an October 9 
censure vote to pass and launching a provision that the 
Assembly elect a new president within 15 days.  Further 
complication arose when parliamentarians for Flosse and 
Temaru named differing dates for the holding of the 
presidential vote.  Temaru parliamentarians boycotted an 
October 19 vote, preventing a necessary quorum to elect the 
new president.  A pro-independence boycott of the October 22 
vote failed to prevent Flosse\'s election due to a reduced 
quorum requirement. 
 
3.  (U) On October 23, the Paris-based State Council, 
France\'s Supreme Court for state and administrative affairs, 
ruled against two motions presented by Temaru\'s supporters to 
nullify the October 9 censure vote.  When Temaru 
parliamentarians boycotted the Assembly meeting on October 25 
-- the date they themselves claimed was the legitimate day 
for elections -- Flosse declared himself the legitimate 
president of French Polynesia based on the October 22 vote. 
Temaru and several dozen of his supporters began a hunger 
strike on October 26 and have refused to vacate the 
Presidential Palace.  They claim they will continue their 
protests until Chirac dissolves the Assembly and holds new 
elections.  Flosse has set up an alternate government and 
claims to have assumed all presidential duties.  He has filed 
a court order to remove Temaru and his supporters from the 
presidential palace; a decision from the court is expected 
October 29. 
 
4.  (U) The tension in Papeete is mirrored in Paris, where 
Socialist Party legislators have lambasted the government and 
PS leader Francois Hollande has criticized Chirac for his 
\"complicity\" in the situation.  Chirac has thus far refused 
to meet with PS leaders to discuss the situation.  Several 
heated debates occurred in the National Assembly between PS 
legislators clamoring for new elections and the Minister for 
Overseas Territories, Brigitte Girardin, who has insisted 
that French Polynesia\'s institutions are functioning as they 
should and that new elections are unnecessary.  The political 
opposition are not the only critics of Chirac.  The president 
of the center-right Union for French Democracy (UDF) Francois 
Beyrou and a deputy from Chirac\'s own UMP party have called 
for new elections.  Delegations in support of Temaru are 
expected to arrive in Paris and Brussels October 30 to push 
for new Polynesian elections in both the national and 
international arenas. 
 
5.  (C) Comment: Criticisms of Flosse have often pointed to 
his very close relationship with Chirac and the existence of 
several ongoing investigations into the former\'s governance, 
including charges of misappropriating state funds stemming 
 
 
from an October 2003 investigation into dozens of individuals 
paid state wages without performing any work.  Temaru\'s 
backers also claim that an audit into Flosse\'s prior 
administration was nearing its conclusion when the censure 
vote occurred.  Chirac helped rework a law in 1997 that gave 
the Polynesian president control over state money for 
discretionary spending, which Flosse allegedly used to his 
political benefit.  From 1997 - 2004, Flosse directed 
additional benefits of nearly 75 euros per person to his own 
municipality, while Temaru\'s received nothing.  Members of 
the UDF have noted that Flosse\'s party actively cased members 
of Temaru\'s coalition, seeking someone who could be convinced 
to switch allegiance and thus allow for the toppling of 
Temaru\'s government.  It is not clear if Chirac or members of 
his government had anything to do with ousting Temaru; 
however, it is likely that Chirac is happier with his 
longtime associate Flosse in power.  Temaru\'s independence 
coalition was a cause of concern for Paris, which strongly 
wishes to avoid French Polynesia being placed on the UN 
decolonization list, as happened with the French territory of 
New Caledonia in 1995. 
 
6.  (C) Comment continued: Of most concern is the current 
state of stability in French Polynesia.  It bodes well that 
an October 16 protest against the censure vote, attended by 
between 15,000 and 20,000 of the island chain\'s 240,000 
inhabitants, proceeded peacefully.  Both Temaru and Flosse 
have called for the population to remain calm.  However, 
tensions in the archipelago are increasing.  In the October 
25 Assembly meeting, partisans of both Flosse and Temaru were 
preemptively separated to avoid conflict.  Additionally, the 
French press has alluded to the 1995 riots that erupted after 
the French government resumed nuclear tests in the islands, 
resulting in the destruction of hundreds of cars, the 
torching of several buildings, and the recall of the Chilean 
and New Zealand ambassadors from Paris.  Most recently, New 
Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff called the growing tension 
worrisome.  While a tense calm currently exists in French 
Polynesia, the complex nature of the political crises, the 
extent to which the GOF may intervene directly, and the 
possibility of trouble merit close following.  End Comment.

1.  (C) Summary: As of 1030 local (0430 EST) November 5, MFA 
officials described Arafat as in a continued coma, with 
uncertainty whether his condition is irreversible or what 
permanent damage he might suffer if he regains consciousness. 
There is still no diagnosis on the cause of his condition. 
In successive discussions with us late November 4, senior MFA 
and Elysee officials described Arafat as unconscious or 
semi-conscious for undetermined causes since November 3, but 
not on the brink of death.  President Chirac, just prior to 
departing for the European Council in Brussels, briefly 
visited Arafat mid-afternoon November 4, and the Palestinian 
leader reportedly responded with a \"twitch and a smile\" to 
Chirac\'s presence.  Chirac\'s Middle East advisor described 
Arafat as at \"3 or 4\" on a medical coma scale between 1 and 
15.  Results of toxicology tests should be complete by 
November 5, though French officials caution that French law 
prevents Arafat\'s doctors from releasing medical information 
without Suha Arafat\'s permission.  Suha Arafat has sought to 
keep a tight lid on public disclosures, and initially 
resisted public clarification November 4 that Arafat was 
not/not dead.  FM Barnier\'s Cabinet Director told us November 
4 he saw three options before the GoF: 1) the GoF flies 
Arafat to Gaza before he dies, 2) Arafat recovers, and 3) 
Arafat dies in France, at which the GoF would have a small 
ceremony at the hospital before flying the body immediately 
back to Gaza.  End summary. 
 
 
NOVEMBER 5 UPDATE 
------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The French daily \"Le Figaro\" reported November 5 that 
Arafat is brain dead, in an irreversible coma and on life 
support, citing an unnamed French doctor treating Arafat. 
Paris PLO representative Leila Shahid publicly denied the 
\"brain death\" stories early November 5, and, while confirming 
for the first time that Arafat was in a coma, described it as 
\"reversible.\" 
 
3.  (C) MFA DAS-equivalent for Israeli/Palestinian/Levant 
Affairs Christian Jouret told poloff at 1030 local November 5 
that Arafat remained in very bad condition and a continued 
coma.  He stressed, though, that it was unclear whether 
Arafat\'s condition was reversible, and what degree of 
permanent neurological damage he might suffer if he did 
regain consciousness.  (Late November 4, Jouret told us 
doctors\' reports had confirmed that Arafat would suffer 
permanent neurological damage if he recovered.)  Asked to 
confirm press reports of negotiations ongoing between France, 
Egypt and Israel over where Arafat should be buried, Jouret 
said he was unaware of GoF involvement in such talks but did 
not exclude that such discussions might already be underway 
between the Israelis and Palestinians. Jouret added that the 
GoF would be prepared to act quickly if asked by Arafat\'s 
entourage to transport the leader outside France, but he 
underlined that no such request had been made and that GoF 
action would be unlikely with both Chirac and FM Barnier out 
of the country today.  (Chirac is in Brussels and heads to 
Abu Dhabi for Shaykh Zayed funeral November 5, while Barnier 
fills in for Chirac at EU Council lunch with Iraqi PM Allawi 
and meets with Iraqi FM Zebari in Brussels today as well.) 
 
 
CHIRAC-ARAFAT VISIT NOVEMBER 4 
---------------- 
 
4.  (C) Between 1700 and 1800 local time (1100 and 1200 EST) 
November 4, we received a series of updates from senior MFA 
and Elysee officials on Arafat\'s health condition, amid 
conflicting press reports, including a false rumor that 
Arafat had died which was later publicly refuted by the 
French military hospital staff.  In the first update, at 1705 
local, MFA Cabinet Advisor Pierre Vimont confirmed to DCM 
that Arafat has been unconscious for past 24 hours, and 
doctors could not explain the cause for the sudden 
deterioration.  Before departing Paris for Brussels for the 
European Council, Chirac had visited Arafat briefly at around 
1515 local, and spoke mainly to Suha Arafat.  Vimont reported 
that when Chirac put his hand on Arafat\'s arm, Arafat 
responded with a \"twitch and a smile,\" which Vimont said was 
likely a reflex.  MFA DAS-equivalent for 
Israel/Palestinian/Levant issues Christian Jouret later told 
poloff that Chirac had entered the room and greeted Arafat by 
saying, \"Hello, Dr. Chirac is in.\" He too reported that 
doctors were unsure whether Arafat\'s response was a reflex or 
not, and described Arafat in \"some kind of coma.\" 
 
5. (C) Elysee Middle East Advisor Andre Parant, who 
accompanied Chirac on the Arafat hospital visit offered a 
slightly more positive description of the PA chairman than 
his MFA counterparts.  Parant described Arafat as 
\"semi-conscious,\" open eyed during the Chirac visit, and in 
very bad condition, but \"not dead yet.\"  Parant added that on 
a medical scale of 1 to 15, with 15 being a full coma, 
doctors had described Arafat as a \"3 or 4.\"  The main cause 
of concern for doctors was that they did not know the cause 
of Arafat\'s deterioration.  Certain tests to facilitate a 
diagnosis were still not possible, for example, due to a 
blood coagulation problem.  Parant also confirmed press 
reports that Arafat was on a ventilator, but described this 
as routine for patients in his condition. 
 
 
TOXICOLOGY TESTS, POISONING RUMORS 
----------- 
 
6.  (C) Parant confirmed that toxicology tests had been 
completed and results should be available by late November 4 
or 5.  Acknowledging the potential dangers of continued 
rumors of an Arafat poisoning, Parant cautioned that negative 
test results might not dampen irrational belief among some 
Palestinians that Arafat had been poisoned.  Poloff stressed 
the need for the GoF to help quash such rumors once test 
results were complete, given the potential for violence to 
ensue over accusations of Israeli complicity in Arafat\'s 
illness.  Parant expressed sympathy, but made no promises. 
He stressed that, under French law, Arafat\'s French (and MOD 
employee) doctors could not release any public information 
about his condition without the consent of his family, namely 
Suha Arafat. The problem, according to Parant, was Suha did 
not want to release any information about Arafat\'s condition, 
and was reluctant even to approve the French doctors\' 
November 4 announcement that Arafat was not/not dead, though 
she finally relented and allowed the announcement to go 
forward.  According to Parant, Suha had threatened to sue the 
French doctors treating Arafat if they released to the public 
any medical information on Arafat without her consent. 
Parant concluded that, if Suha agreed to release the 
toxicology reports, there would be no problem.  If, however, 
she found the results inconclusive or sought to prevent a 
public announcement of the results, that was her prerogative. 
 
NEXT STEPS? 
-------- 
 
7. (C) Of our GoF interlocutors, only Barnier Cabinet 
Director Vimont was forthcoming on discussing potential next 
steps in detail, during his November 4 conversation with DCM. 
 Vimont said he saw three potential scenarios: 1) the GoF 
flies Arafat to Gaza soon so he dies in Gaza, 2) Arafat 
recovers, and 3) Arafat dies in France, at which the GoF 
would need to have a \"little ceremony\" at the hospital, and 
then fly him right away to Gaza.  One complication, remained 
that if Arafat died in France, GoF law requires autopsy in 
cases where death is due to unknown causes.  Vimont suggested 
that GoF was assuming that Arafat\'s family wanted burial to 
take place in Gaza and that burial would need to take place 
quickly; it was not clear if the GoF had consulted with Suha 
on this. Vimont did not see a Jerusalem burial as an option. 
 
8. (C) Vimont added that he saw three groups of Palestinians 
gathered  in Paris: 1) a small group at hospital, 2) those 
trying to get in to hospital, and 3) a group staying at 
Intercontinental hotel, who are leaking the dire health 
information to the press. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C) Comment: With the tight public information lock-down 
on Arafat\'s health being maintained by Suha Arafat, and the 
GoF keeping its own information limited to the highest levels 
(Jouret, for example, told us the MFA learned of Chirac\'s 
visit to Arafat via French TV), we expect the current flow of 
conflicting reports and misinformation (especially from the 
Arafat entourage) to continue unabated.  Given the reluctance 
of Suha Arafat and Leila Shahid to confirm known details of 
Arafat\'s deterioration, it is entirely likely that public 
announcement of Arafat\'s death, when and if that occurs, may 
be delayed by the Palestinian hospital entourage.  At the 
same time, with the French president and FM out of the 
country November 5, we do not think French officials see 
Arafat as literally on the brink of death, although it 
appears his condition is indeed very, very bad.  End comment.

1.  (U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA 
DAS-equivalent for Human Rights in the Directorate of United 
Nations and International Organizations Affairs Beatrice le 
Fraper du Hellen on November 9.  She indicated that France 
would co-sponsor all of the reftel resolutions and would vote 
against any resolutions introduced by Belarus to draw 
attention away from its human rights record. 
 
2.  (U) Le Fraper du Hellen raised several thematic 
resolutions currently before the General Assembly.  She noted 
that France would not be able to accommodate the US wish to 
withdraw language on the ICC from the resolution on political 
disappearances.  France also has reservations, she said, 
about US positions on reproductive health with regard to 
resolutions on women\'s issues.  Discussions continued, she 
noted, regarding cloning. 
 
3.  (U) The MFA continues to hope that an agreement will be 
reached among all WEOG countries on a rotating membership for 
the Human Rights Commission; however, le Fraper du Hellen 
continued, differences on these substantive issues could 
prove a stumbling block to agreement on the rotation 
procedure. 
 
4.  (C) Comment.  The MFA official\'s suggestion that support 
for a WEOG UNCHR rotation plan may be contingent on 
satisfactory resolution of substantive differences on 
thematic resolutions is new.  Until this point, France has 
been willing to explore a rotation plan, as long as a 
compromise acceptable to all WEOG members could be found (and 
French equities protected).  The suggestion of a substantive 
quid pro quo from le Fraper du Hellen may have simply been an 
off-the-cuff remark from a relatively junior Quai official 
not representative of GOF policy -- or an indication of a 
shift.  We will attempt to pin this down in future contacts 
with the Quai.  End comment.

1.  (C) Summary: Poloff delivered reftel demarche and 
non-paper to MFA Cuba Desk Officer Eric Chaux and U.S. desk 
officer Jean-Charles Bou on November 12.  Chaux opened by 
saying that even if there were a change in the EU common 
policy toward Cuba, the GoF would remain critical of the 
Castro regime\'s human rights record and stress that the 
gesture of releasing seven of the imprisoned dissidents for 
health reasons was not sufficient.  Additionally, he 
continued, the GoF saw no reason to change its position on 
Cuba at the UN.  Chaux asserted that the GoF had been 
considering its position on the EU policy with regards to 
Cuba in light of Spanish efforts to change approaches, but 
had not yet reached any conclusions.  Chaux added that France 
would use the upcoming November 16 COLAT meeting to debate 
the merits of the sanctions put in place in June 2003 and 
reach a common decision with the other EU member states. 
However, despite his insistence that the GoF was still 
undecided, Chaux seemed to be letting us know that the GoF 
would likely support changes to EU policy proposed by Spain. 
End summary. 
 
2.  (C) Chaux underlined that the U.S. and EU shared the same 
goal for Cuba: improvement in the human rights situation and 
peaceful evolution to democracy.  The November 16 debate 
would be an opportunity for the EU to evaluate the 
effectiveness of its policy in making progress towards these 
goals.  Chaux noted that some EU countries felt that the 
freezing of communications between the GoC and European 
Embassies in Havana as a result of the June 2003 sanctions 
had cut off their ability to work with more moderate, 
non-hardline members of the Cuban government.  He emphasized 
that if the EU policy changed, it would not be because the EU 
was less critical of Cuba or that the GoF would stop working 
with the opposition.  In fact, Chaux hypothesized, a change 
in policy might allow more interaction with the opposition, 
albeit in a less visible and symbolic manner than inviting 
then to national day celebrations. The EU would have to weigh 
the \"gains\" of these symbolic invitations against the \"loss\" 
of access to some members of the GoC.  Chaux remarked that 
the GoF had not specifically considered any of the 
recommendations proposed in the U.S. non-paper, but that 
these proposals would likely be a part of the November 16 
discussions.  Comment: We believe that Chaux\'s \"hypothetical\" 
musings indicate that the GoF is seriously considering 
supporting, if not already planning to actively support, the 
Spanish proposed changes to EU policy.  End comment. 
 
3.  (C) Poloff mentioned that new MFA Director for the 
Americas Daniel Parfait would be traveling to Washington in 
December and had requested meetings with A/S Jones and A/S 
Noriega, and that Cuba would likely be a topic of 
conversation.  Chaux hoped that the meetings would be an 
opportunity to reinforce U.S./French common goals for Cuba 
and an occasion to brainstorm together about Cuba\'s future. 
As subjects for discussion, Chaux specifically mentioned the 
roles of dissidents and the Florida diaspora after the 
dictatorship as well as U.S. strategies for the various 
possible scenarios in a post-Castro Cuba.

SUBJECT: INTERIOR MINISTER VILLEPIN DISCUSSES ANTI-SEMITISM 
WITH U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM REPRESENTATIVES 
 
 
Sensitive but unclassified.  Protect accordingly. 
 
1.  (U) Summary: Throughout his meeting with United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum officials on November 19, Interior 
Minister Villepin underlined the GOF determination to fight 
anti-Semitism in every way possible.  Villepin decried the 
rise in the number of anti-Semitic acts in France, commented 
on the recently released Rufin report on anti-Semitism, 
reviewed judicial action against perpetrators of anti-Semitic 
acts, and outlined measures he will propose to further combat 
anti-Semitism.  The Interior Minister also highlighted the 
growing concern about the rise in anti-Semitism across 
Europe.  End Summary. 
 
 
RISE IN ANTI-SEMITIC ACTS 
------------------------- 
2.  (U) On November 19, French Interior Minister Dominique de 
Villepin met with visiting U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum 
director Sara Bloomfield and museum officials Paul Shapiro 
and Radu Ioanid.  Villepin began the meeting by noting that 
there had been 166 violent anti-Semitic acts committed during 
the first ten months of the year.  While 10 or 11 of those 
could be attributed to elements of the extreme right, and 
approximately 50 more were committed by individuals of 
Maghreb or Arab origin, the perpetrators and motives are 
unclear for more than 100 of these incidents.  Villepin 
posited that many of these incidents are likely the work of 
individuals copying crimes who may be confused about their 
own motive for attacking Jews and Jewish sites.  Villepin 
noted that, while there had been almost identical numbers of 
Jewish and Muslim cemeteries desecrated in recent months, 
there had been many more Christian churches attacked. 
However, many Church authorities do not report or draw 
attention to such attacks to avoid copycats. 
 
3.  (U) In response to a question on the effect of foreign 
events on the rise in anti-Semitic acts in France, Villepin 
acknowledged that the rate of incidents increased 
dramatically after the beginning of the second Intifada in 
September/October 2000.  However, Villepin stated, the plight 
of the Palestinians is not the main cause of anti-Semitism in 
France; most North African and Arab youths in France have 
little understanding of the situation in the region.  Rather, 
he continued, anti-Semitism is a result of feelings of 
rejection and the lack of identity of some groups on the 
fringes of society.  Villepin\'s analysis tracks with the 
conclusions of the recently released report on anti-Semitism 
in France by noted humanitarian Jean-Cristophe Rufin that 
Villepin had requested in June.  Villepin also cited the 
Rufin report in making the link between the extreme left and 
anti-Semitism, noting that strong anti-Zionist sentiment can 
veer into anti-Semitism. 
 
GOF ACTION AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM 
-------------------------------- 
4.  (U) Villepin insisted that the GOF is committed to 
combating anti-Semitism in every way possible.  The GOF 
reacts quickly, strongly, and publicly after anti-Semitic 
incidents.  Additionally, the GOF has launched education 
initiatives, brought together religious groups for 
inter-faith dialogue, and created an inter-ministerial 
committee that serves as a model for other EU countries.  On 
the judicial front, Villepin stated that punishments for 
anti-Semitic acts have been increased, although these 
toughened punishments must be applied to be effective. 
Villepin also added that judges are increasingly giving 
harsher sentences.  Currently, the Interior Ministry is 
working closely with the Justice Ministry on a special 
program to combat cyber-crime, and the GOF plans to monitor 
the internet for hate sites. 
 
FOREIGN FUNDING OF MUSLIM ORGANIZATIONS 
--------------------------------------- 
5.  (U) Villepin then turned to the problem of foreign 
funding of French Muslim organizations.  He noted that 
donating money is an important part of Islam, and, in many 
parts of the world, it is the fundamentalist groups that 
provide social services to the needy.  Villepin stressed the 
need to find a different and open financing structure to make 
sure social work in France is not coming from radical groups, 
citing efforts to create a system for receiving and 
collecting money from foreign governments and citizens that 
would help negate direct funding and, therefore, influence 
from abroad.  Such a foundation would also allow the money to 
be directed to organizations known to be free of radical 
ties.  Villepin also pointed out that French intelligence 
closely monitors the speeches of imams to ensure that they 
are not spreading violent sermons, and he spoke of the need 
to educate imams in the French language, institutions, and 
culture.  (Note.  This meeting took place as Villepin was 
unveiling the GOF\'s plan to facilitate the funding of mosques 
through the establishment of a foundation, details of which 
 
 
will be reported septel.  End note.) 
 
HOLDING FIRM AGAINST ENCROACHMENT ON REPUBLIC IDEALS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
6.  (SBU) Perhaps most insightful were Villepin\'s closing 
comments concerning the law banning religious symbols in 
schools, which he said has been \"unfairly\" referred to in the 
media as the \"veil law.\"  He noted that he had met with three 
Muslim groups before the beginning of the school year, 
telling them he would not tolerate opposition to the law and 
warning that he would vigorously combat any group that 
encouraged girls to wear headscarves or offered lawyers to 
fight the law.  \"You must understand that first and foremost 
these groups want to be legitimate.  That is why we must say 
\'no.\'  If you give them this much (indicating the first 
knuckle on his index finger), they will demand this much 
(indicating second knuckle).  That is why you must be 
forceful and say \'no.\'  Keep them here (pointing to end of 
finger).  We must stick strictly to the rules of the 
Republic.  If we don\'t go by the book, we will be swallowed 
up.  If we are not strict about what they can and can\'t do, 
they will impose their own rules.\"

France.  Per reftel, Word versions will be e-mailed to John 
Kincannon and Kiersten McCutchan at S/CT.  Post POC is 
Political Officer Peter Kujawinski, x.2575. 
 
France ) 2004 
 
OVERVIEW 
 
In 2004, France made progress in a number of areas that 
enhanced its already robust counter-terrorism capability. 
The Perben II law entered into force on October 1, ensuring 
domestic implementation of the European Arrest Warrant and 
expanding the tools police, security and judiciary officials 
can use to combat terrorism.  In April, French authorities 
discovered and shut down a network of the Moroccan Islamic 
Combatant Group that was considered to be extremely 
dangerous.  In July, it took custody of four former detainees 
at Guantanamo Bay and charged them with terrorist conspiracy. 
 All four of the detainees remain in pretrial detention and 
trials are expected to begin in 2005.  In October, French and 
Spanish authorities struck a significant blow to ETA 
terrorism in their arrest in France of two top ETA leaders 
and in the seizure of significant arms and materials caches. 
With these and a number of other high profile arrests and 
convictions in 2004, it is clear that France continues its 
aggressive and effective anti-terrorist policies.  Despite 
robust U.S.-French cooperation on counter-terrorism, French 
officials continue to differ with the U.S. on the impact of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom on international terrorism, with 
French officials suggesting that Iraq,s liberation has made 
the world less safe and increased international terrorism. 
In 2004, four French nationals were identified as having been 
killed while fighting Coalition and Iraqi forces in Iraq. 
 
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES 
 
France continues to be an active and engaged participant in 
the international war against terrorism.  On the military 
front, its special forces participate in counter-terrorist 
operations in Afghanistan and a French admiral commands Task 
Force 150, a multinational naval force that patrols the Red 
Sea and the Persian Gulf to interdict the movement of 
suspected terrorists from Afghanistan to the Arabian 
Peninsula.  At the political and diplomatic level, France 
continues its engagement within the UN,s Counter-Terrorism 
Committee and the G-8,s Counter-Terrorism Action Group. 
France is a party to all 12 international conventions and 
protocols relating to terrorism. 
 
In 2004, France expanded its cooperation in international 
judicial cooperation.  With the entry into force of the 
Perben II law, France incorporated into its domestic 
legislation the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant and 
strengthened its already extensive judicial and police powers 
to combat terrorism.  For example, the law outlaws websites 
that post bomb-making instructions.  In September, police 
shut down three such websites and arrested a computer science 
student for building one of them.  In addition, France signed 
with the United States on September 2 two new agreements that 
updated a bilateral extradition treaty and improved overall 
counter-terrorism cooperation.  France and the Netherlands 
were among the first European countries to sign such 
agreements with the United States. 
 
France and the United States continue to cooperate closely on 
border security issues, including airplane safety and the 
Container Security Initiative.  Possible threats to airplane 
flights during the 2003-2004 holiday season were investigated 
jointly by US and French authorities.  French police and 
security services have been very responsive to US requests. 
In addition, France is active internationally in proposing 
bioterrorism safeguards and nuclear facility safeguards.  In 
March, the Paris Prefecture of Police announced the formation 
of a specialized, 90-person firefighting unit that would 
focus on combating nuclear, radiological, biological and 
chemical terrorist attacks.  Also, in May, the French 
government simulated a bomb attack on the Paris metro to test 
the ability of emergency services to respond. 
 
On terrorism financing, France continues to develop the 
competencies and capabilities of TRACFIN, the Ministry of 
Finance,s terrorism financing coordination and investigation 
unit.  TRACFIN has expanded the number of economic sectors it 
monitors within the French economy, with a particular 
emphasis on institutions, non-governmental organizations and 
small enterprises suspected of having ties to Islamic 
terrorism.  At the level of the European Union, France plays 
an active role in the Clearinghouse, the Union,s terrorism 
financing coordination body.  France has designated as 
terrorist groups those that appear on the EU list of 
terrorist organizations.  As of yet, it has not designated 
Hamas-affiliated charities, arguing that they have no links 
to terrorism.  It also, along with its EU partners, has not 
designated Lebanese Hizballah as a terrorist organization. 
 
French authorities consistently condemn terrorist acts and 
have made no public statements in support of a 
terrorist-supporting country on a terrorism issue. 
Nevertheless, France, along with its EU partners, retains 
diplomatic relations with all of the governments designated 
as state sponsors of terrorism, with the exception of North 
Korea.  In 2004 it cosponsored with the United States UN 
Security Council Resolution 1559, which targeted Syrian 
domination of Lebanon and called for dismantlement of armed 
groups and militias in Lebanon and extension of Lebanese 
government control throughout Lebanese territory, to include 
areas under the de facto control of Hizballah. 
 
DOMESTIC ACTIVITIES 
 
France is perhaps best known for its seasoned and aggressive 
counter-terrorism police forces and judiciary.  Within the 
Ministry of Interior, the DST (internal security service), RG 
(police intelligence), DNAT (counter-terrorism brigade) and 
Brigade Criminelle (criminal investigations) all play 
important roles in French counter-terrorism work.  In 2004, 
as part of a move to improve cooperation among France,s 
security services, a new terrorism coordination cell was 
created that will be based in the headquarters of the DGSE, 
France,s external intelligence service and part of the 
Ministry of Defense.  Personnel from the RG and the DST will 
be part of the coordination unit.  This new initiative adds 
another coordination body to an already crowded field.  Other 
coordination mechanisms include UCLAT (a counter-terrorism 
coordination unit with the Ministry of Interior), the SGDN 
(attached to the office of the Prime Minister), the 
Intelligence Council and the Council for Internal Security 
(attached to the office of the President.)  There is 
virtually no legislative oversight of intelligence and 
security agencies. 
 
Terrorism investigations that may lead to criminal charges 
are handled by the counter-terrorism section of the Paris 
Prosecutor,s office.  Investigative judges, who in the 
French system combine prosecutorial and judicial powers, 
concentrate on Islamic/international terrorism, Basque/ETA 
terrorism and terrorism linked to Corsican separatist groups. 
 Their mandate is extensive, and includes terrorist acts on 
French soil and acts abroad that affect French citizens. 
Their powers are substantial and they are given wide freedom 
to investigate.  They cooperate closely with French police 
and security services. 
 
Under French law, terrorism suspects may be detained for up 
to 96 hours before charges are filed.  In addition, suspects 
can be held for up to three and a half years in pretrial 
detention while the investigation against them continues. 
There is general public acceptance of these measures. 
Olivier Roy, a French terrorism expert, told the Associated 
Press on December 7 that &there,s a tradition in France of 
a strong state and people want to have a strong state.8 
Barring the revelation of serious abuses, there is little 
indication that French citizens would want to decrease the 
extensive powers given to French investigating judges, police 
and security services. 
 
French police and intelligence services within the Interior 
Ministry have extensive powers of surveillance, monitoring 
and administrative detention.  These powers were enhanced 
with the March 9 passage of Perben II (with entry into force 
on October 1) and include expanded detention (up to four days 
before charges must be brought), more authority for police to 
go undercover, warrants for searches at night, more leeway in 
granting document searches, and increased authority to 
wiretap.  These expanded powers are to be used only in cases 
that involve investigation of organizations &that imperil 
society,8 such as the mafia, drug traffickers and terrorist 
organizations.  Even if government authorities are found to 
have misused their new powers, any evidence they have found 
would still be accepted in court. 
 
Judicial and police investigations following the high-profile 
arrests in 2003 of German national Christian Ganczarski and 
Moroccan national Karim Mehdi continued in 2004.  Ganczarski 
and Mehdi, who are suspected of ties to al-Qaida, remain in 
pretrial detention in France. 
 
The investigation into the activities of suspected terrorist 
Djamel Beghal concluded in late 2004.  His trial, as well as 
the trials of seven associates, will begin January 3, 2005. 
The Beghal network is suspected of planning to commit a 
number of terrorist acts, including an attack on the US 
Embassy in Paris. 
 
French police and judicial authorities arrested six suspected 
members of the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM) on 
April 5.  An investigation into their activities is ongoing. 
The six suspects are being held in pretrial detention.  The 
GICM cell is thought to have provided logistical support to 
those who committed the attacks against Madrid trains on 
March 11.  French authorities also arrested five individuals 
in mid-November on charges of stealing one million euros from 
a Brinks delivery truck that restocked ATM machines.  These 
individuals are suspected of having links with the GICM cell. 
 
Judicial and police investigations are also continuing in the 
&Chechen network,8 a loose grouping that is reported to 
have links with the Beghal network and the Frankfurt network 
(which attempted in 2000 to attack cultural sites in 
Strasbourg, including the cathedral).  Members of the Chechen 
network reportedly were interested in using chemical agents 
to commit terrorist attacks.  French authorities arrested 
Zinnedine Khalid on June 14, one of the suspected members of 
the Chechen network.  They also suspect that the Chechen 
network may have links with a possible Asian network that 
included Lionel Dumont, a French citizen in custody who had 
lived previously in Japan.  The trial of ten suspected 
members of the Frankfurt network began in Paris on September 
29 and is expected to last three months. 
 
In May, a Paris court convicted two French citizens, Ahmed 
Laidouni and David Courtailler, and an Algerian citizen, 
Mohamed Baadache, for organizing recruitment networks for 
terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.  Baadache received 
the maximum sentence of 10 years under terrorist conspiracy 
laws.  Laidouni was given 7 years, while Courtailler was 
given two years in jail along with a suspended two-year 
sentence. 
 
Following the July 27 transfer of four French citizens 
detained at Guantanamo Bay, French authorities successfully 
argued in favor of their pretrial detention while judicial 
authorities are preparing cases that charge them with 
terrorist conspiracy.  These arguments have withstood 
multiple appeals by defense lawyers and the detainees remain 
in pretrial detention.  France has been one of the most 
aggressive and proactive countries in prosecuting its 
citizens formerly held by the U.S. at Guantanamo. 
 
The French government publicly condemned acts of terrorism 
targeting civilians in Iraq on multiple occasions in 2004. 
Nevertheless, throughout the year, French government 
officials, including President Chirac, continued to assert 
publicly that the liberation of Iraq had made the world less 
safe and increased international terrorism.  These criticisms 
reflect broader U.S.-French divergences on Iraq policy in 
general. 
 
Four French citizens have been identified in 2004 as killed 
while fighting in Iraq.  Amidst concerns that radical 
Islamists with French citizenship were beginning to enter 
Iraq to fight Multinational and Iraqi forces and commit 
terrorist acts in Iraq, the Paris Prosecutor,s office opened 
an investigation into a possible network of Islamists 
recruiting French citizens to fight in Iraq.  That 
investigation is ongoing. 
 
On October 8, an early morning bomb exploded in front of the 
Indonesian Embassy in Paris.  No one was killed, although the 
bomb caused significant damage.  French authorities continue 
to investigate the bombing.  However, responsibility for the 
investigation was transferred to the counter-terrorism 
section of the Paris Prosecutor,s office, signifying that 
the French government suspects terrorism as a motive. 
 
French and Spanish authorities have jointly made significant 
progress in combating Basque separatist groups, including the 
ETA.  In early October, French police arrested Mikel Albizu 
Iriarte and Soledad Iparraguirre, two suspected ETA leaders. 
They also arrested at least sixteen other suspects, and 
seized money and hundreds of pounds of explosives.  In 2004, 
the French and Spanish governments have formed two joint 
investigative teams, one focusing on al-Qaida-related groups 
and the second focusing on Basque separatist groups. 
 
Despite a truce announced in November 2003 by the main 
Corsican separatist movements ) the FLNC Union of Combatants 
) the island continues to experience low-level terrorist 
activities.  Examples include the bombing of selected 
commercial and symbolic sites, the machine-gunning of a local 
gendarmerie post in October, and a rocket attack against 
another gendarmerie post in May.  No one was killed in these 
attacks, most of which occurred at night.  According to 
French authorities, there have been 76 explosions at police 
stations in Corsica over the last three years.  French police 
arrested in November twelve of 14 suspected members of the 
&Clandestini Corsi8 group, which claimed responsibility for 
seven recent attacks targeting Corsican residents of north 
African ancestry. 
 
At the administrative level, France continued its policy of 
expulsions for non-French citizens engaged in what the French 
government considered activities that promote hate.  In 
response to sermons from several Muslim clerics determined to 
have threatened public order by calling for jihad, Parliament 
passed a law in July stating that a foreigner can be deported 
for publicly supporting acts of hatred, discrimination or 
violence against any specific person or group of persons. 
The highest profile expulsion in 2004 was that of Muslim 
prayer leader Abdelkader Bouziane, who was first expelled to 
Algeria in April, then returned to France after an 
administrative court suspended that ruling.  Bouziane, who 
had made widely publicized statements condoning wife beating, 
was expelled a second time on October 5.  In addition, Midhat 
Guler, a Turkish mosque leader and accused leader of the 
extremist group &Kaplan,8 was expelled on April 29. 
Although expulsions have long been a favorite tool used by 
French authorities, in 2004 they gained more prominence. 
Interior Minister de Villepin publicly stated he would make 
expulsion procedures faster and easier. 
 
In June, following the passage of a law giving new regulatory 
powers to the Conseil Superieur d,Audiovisuel (CSA), 
France,s FCC-equivalent, the CSA began sanctions proceedings 
against al-Manar, a Hezbollah-affiliated satellite television 
station, and al-Alam, a satellite television station based in 
Iran.  The CSA accused both stations of anti-Semitic 
programming, propaganda in favor of suicide bombings, and the 
diffusion of hate.  The subsequent granting of a limited 
broadcast license to al-Manar on November 19 was 
controversial, and prompted Prime Minister Raffarin to 
declare that al-Manar was &incompatible with French 
values.8  After reviewing al-Manar programming after it 
received its broadcast license, the CSA again petitioned the 
Conseil d,Etat, France,s highest administrative court, to 
ban the station.  On December 13, the Conseil d,Etat agreed 
with the CSA, and ordered al-Manar off French airwaves.  In 
addition, Raffarin has asked the European Union to weigh in 
on the issue of &non-European8 media and their broadcasting 
of programs that are incompatible with European values 
concerning hate and anti-Semitism.  It is clear that for many 
inside and outside the government, stations such as al-Manar 
and al-Alam pose a direct threat to French values, and in 
addition, serve as a rear-guard action fighting the 
government,s efforts to disseminate these values. 
 
In February, the French government banned satellite 
television station Medya TV from broadcasting in France. 
Medya TV is affiliated with PKK/Kongra Gel, which is listed 
as a terrorist organization by the European Union. 
 
Worries over the rise of radical Islam in France have 
prompted Interior Minister Sarkozy, followed by his 
successor, Interior Minister de Villepin, to propose a number 
of steps to combat this threat.  Some, mentioned earlier, 
focus on better coordination between the many French services 
that deal with terrorism.  Other steps focus on the need to 
better integrate France,s minority Muslim population. 
Villepin stated December 7 that it was unacceptable that &of 
the 1200 imams who practice in our country, 75 percent are 
not French and one-third do not speak our language.8  He 
proposed, among other things, the creation of a foundation to 
manage money destined for Muslim groups in France and offer 
greater transparency and oversight of overseas fundraising 
for Muslim institutions in France.  According to the Ministry 
of Interior, approximately 50 of 1,685 Muslim places of 
worship are considered to have ties to radical Islam.

1.  (U) As per reftel, Poloff spoke to MFA DAS-equivalent for 
Human Rights in the Directorate of United Nations and 
International Organizations Affairs Beatrice le Fraper du 
Hellen about the need to lobby third countries against 
supporting any \"no action motions\" that might be brought by 
Iran or Turkmenistan.  Ms. Fraper du Hellen indicated that 
France was actively working to fight against efforts to 
undermine draft UN resolutions critical of human rights 
practices, and that the GOF had spoken to a number of 
countries about opposing possible no action motions and in 
support of the resolutions on Sudan and Zimbabwe. 
 
2.  (U) According to Ms. Fraper du Hellen, the GOF had asked 
the following countries to vote in line with US/EU positions 
or, at worst, abstain: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brunei, Central 
African Republic, Comoros, Djibouti, Equitorial Guinea, 
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, Laos, Moldova, Niger, 
Tajikistan, Togo.  Ms. Fraper du Hellen indicated that most 
countries indicated that they \"took note\" or would \"consider\" 
GOF requests.  Armenia indicated it hesitated voting against 
Iran because of an upcoming visit by the Armenian President 
to Tehran.  Niger said it would vote in line with the Islamic 
States -- in favor of Iran.  However, Fraper du Hellen seemed 
encouraged that efforts to switch third country votes would 
fail to garner enough support to pass motions of no action.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, AO, BC, LT, MI, MZ, WA, SF, WZ, ZA, ZI, ZU, XA, FR 
SUBJECT: FRANCE AND SOUTHERN AFRICA 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: This is the first of several messages 
reviewing France\'s relations with Africa.  The southern 
African region currently attracts less French attention than 
any other region of Africa.  With no francophone countries, 
and only one country currently engaged in conflict (Angola, 
at much lower levels than in the past), the region is not 
central to France\'s political interests and its engagements 
are relatively limited.  The GOF\'s problems with Angola over 
a judicial investigation into arms trafficking, however, have 
created political difficulties and may have repercussions for 
French petroleum interests.  High-level contacts between 
France and South Africa have increased in recent years and, 
as currently demonstrated in Cote d\'Ivoire, Presidents Chirac 
and Mbeki have established a dialogue on crisis resolution. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
ANGOLA 
 
2. (C) Since the death of Jonas Savimbi in February 2002, 
France has not had to contend with Angolan complaints about 
French support, particularly from the politicians on the 
right of the political spectrum such as former Defense 
Minister Leotard, for UNITA.  Similarly, we have seen no 
recent public claims by Angola of French support for the FLEC 
(Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda). 
According to the MFA, many FLEC leaders are in Paris, and 
Daniel Antonio Rosa, a member of the Angolan intelligence 
service working from the Angolan Embassy, is charged with 
monitoring their activities, occasionally meeting with them 
to \"buy them off.\" 
 
3. (C) However, the judicial investigation into the affairs 
of French businessman Pierre Falcone, allegedly involved in 
supplying arms to Angola in 1993-94 in violation of the 1991 
Bicesse Agreement between the GRA and UNITA, continues to 
complicate Franco/Angolan relations, with press reports of 
Angolan threats to French petroleum interests.  According to 
the MFA, the traffic in arms was not in itself illegal, but 
Falcone and others implicated in the \"Angolagate\" affair 
failed to comply with a law dating from 1939 (resulting from 
arms trafficking during the Spanish Civil War), requiring 
French nationals to report such activities to the government. 
 
 
4. (C) Apparently unreceptive to, or uncomprehending of, 
French explanations of division of powers between Executive 
and Judicial branches, the GRA decided during the summer of 
2003 to name Falcone as an Angolan diplomat accredited to 
UNESCO in Paris.  This appointment followed the efforts of 
then French FM de Villepin to secure the support of Angola 
(then a U.N. Security Council member) to oppose military 
action in Iraq when, according to press reports (denied by 
the MFA), Villepin made some rash promises to the Angolans 
regarding the Falcone affair. 
 
5. (C) Angolan President dos Santos apparently regards 
Falcone as someone who came to Angola\'s aid at a time of 
need.  Dos Santos used the 2001 accreditation ceremony for 
French Ambassador Alain Richard (who had had to wait six 
months to present his credentials) to blast France for 
alleged \"defamation campaigns affecting the reputation and 
interests of Angola.\"  Richard\'s successor, Guy Azais, was 
subjected to a similar lengthy wait before being able to 
present his credentials just prior to Ambassador Efird, who 
had arrived in country only a few days earlier. 
 
6. (C) Presidents Chirac and dos Santos do not have the warm 
relationship Chirac enjoys with many other long-serving 
African heads of state, e.g. Eyadema, Bongo and Sassou. 
Chirac last visited Luanda in July 1998 and, while dos Santos 
spends vacation time in France, he notably failed to appear 
in Paris for the February 2003 France/Africa summit, attended 
by 42 African heads of state or government. 
 
7. (C) In an effort to engage with the GRA, French FM Michel 
Barnier sent a long letter to FM Miranda in September, again 
seeking to explain why it was impossible for France to 
intervene in the Falcone investigation.  The GOF hoped to 
arrange a visit to Luanda by Barnier, and, according to the 
MFA, Ambassador Azais has made two requests to fix a date. 
With the Angolans having responded \"not now,\" the MFA says 
they will not ask a third time. 
 
8. (C) The MFA is dismissive of the reported threats against 
French petroleum interests, noting that TOTAL works with UK 
and U.S. companies in Angola, never taking a majority 
position.  Thus, according to the MFA, any GRA action on any 
oil concession would not only affect TOTAL, but also British 
Petroleum and Chevron. 
 
SOUTH AFRICA 
 
9. (C) In 2003, South African President Thabo Mbeki visited 
France on four occasions.  In January, in the presence of 
UNSYG Annan and numerous African heads of state, President 
Chirac invited Mbeki to lead the discussions at the Kleber 
center meeting following the Marcoussis accords for Cote 
d\'Ivoire.  Mbeki returned in February for the France/Africa 
summit and was again present in Evian in June when France 
hosted the G8 summit.  Mbeki then made a state visit to 
France in November, in part to mark the tenth anniversary of 
South Africa\'s transition to democracy. 
 
10. (C) Chirac evidently admires Mbeki\'s leadership on NEPAD 
and his willingness to engage on conflict resolution in the 
DRC, Burundi, the Comoros and, currently, in Cote d\'Ivoire. 
According to our MFA contacts, the relationship between 
Chirac and Mbeki has helped to dispel mutual mistrust which 
had existed in the 1970\'s when black South Africans regarded 
France as being too indulgent with the apartheid regime, and 
France had seen South Africa as a rival for regional 
influence. 
 
11. (C) As with Angola, a judicial investigation, this time 
in South Africa, has complicated the relationship.  The 
French were irritated by unorthodox initial steps taken by 
South African justice officials investigating alleged 
corruption by Vice-President Jacob Zuma relating to missile 
sales by the French Thales company, but these difficulties 
were resolved by an agreement on judicial cooperation. 
According to the MFA, the South African investigation on the 
Thales-related matter ended in August 2004. 
 
12. (C) The French seem pleased that Foreign Minister 
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma made an effort to learn French, 
including by spending three weeks in a total immersion course 
in France.  The polite assessment by MFA officials of her 
proficiency is \"she\'s not bad,\" but one contact offered that 
Zuma can not do much more than ask for a cup of coffee with 
sugar.  Notwithstanding the language barrier, FMs Barnier and 
Zuma are in almost weekly contact, according to the MFA.  We 
expect the Chirac/Mbeki relationship to continue to deepen, 
with France and South Africa working together on Cote 
d\'Ivoire and other crises in Africa.  Beyond Africa, we also 
expect Chirac and Mbeki from time to time to coordinate 
public positions on other issues, such as Iraq, where their 
views coincide. 
 
ZIMBABWE 
 
13. (C) French views on Zimbabwe differ sharply from our own. 
 Where we see an erosion of the economy, human rights and the 
rule of law, the GOF compares Zimbabwe with other African 
states and sees the situation as \"not so bad.\"  The elections 
in Rwanda, in French eyes, were less fair than those in 
Zimbabwe; the suppression of the media in Cote d\'Ivoire, 
according to the MFA, is worse than in Zimbabwe.  Referring 
to the atrocities committed in Ndebeleland in the 
mid-eighties \"condemned by no-one,\" an MFA contact told us 
that there had never been rule of law in Zimbabwe. 
 
14. (C) Our differences over Zimbabwe were highlighted by the 
French invitation to Robert Mugabe to attend the February 
2003 France/Africa summit.  Other than Rwandan President 
Kagame\'s disavowal of the Chirac-inspired condemnation of 
military action in Iraq, Chirac\'s handshake with Mugabe (even 
a Frenchman wouldn\'t kiss the Zimbabwean leader) is perhaps 
the only lasting memory of that affair. 
 
15. (C) Our French contacts, occasionally complaining about 
the tone of our demarches the issue, told us that not 
inviting Mugabe would have led to a boycott by other African 
leaders, possibly even to a north/south or white/black 
schism.  The French view the British as largely responsible 
for the current situation in Zimbabwe, asserting that British 
failure to implement the terms of the 1980 Lancaster House 
agreement led inevitably to Mugabe\'s land seizures from \"a 
handful of white farmers.\" 
 
16. (C) The French view the British as obsessed with Mugabe, 
and vice versa.  They see the UK and the U.S. adopting a 
double standard with regard to Zimbabwe.  The French 
expectation is that ZANU-PF will do the bare minimum to meet 
the five SADC criteria for elections.  If the MDC boycotts, 
ZANU-PF will be able to claim legitimate victory.  If not, 
according to the MFA, they will do what is necessary to win, 
but the elections will be no worse than those in neighboring 
Mozambique, or those elsewhere in Africa which have been 
accepted, even praised by western nations.  The MFA envisions 
this scenario leading to SADC blessing of the elections as 
free and fair, making it difficult for the UK or the U.S. to 
condemn them. 
 
17. (C) Following MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai\'s visit to 
France several years ago, MFA contacts described him as 
unimpressive, and we could elicit no condemnation from French 
officials regarding the irregularities and excesses 
orchestrated by the GOZ before, during and after the 2002 
elections.  With no significant political or economic 
interests in Zimbabwe, we assess that the French will 
continue to argue for engagement, rather than isolation of 
Mugabe and his regime.  In particular, the French plan to 
push the EU to take a set-by-step approach to lifting 
sanctions in response to anticipated moves by the GOZ.  The 
French recognize that their approach faces stiff opposition 
from London, particularly in a British election year. 
 
MOZAMBIQUE AND NAMIBIA 
 
18. (C) According to the MFA, Presidents Chirac and Chissano 
knew and liked each other well.  Chissano studied in France 
and the GOF courted Chissano when necessary, particularly 
during the Mozambican president\'s tenure as President of the 
African Union.  While Maputo was on the itinerary for one of 
former FM de Villepin\'s first (of many) trips to Africa, it 
was selected when scheduling made meetings in South Africa 
impossible.  Mozambique receives more French development 
assistance than any other non-francophone country, but we 
detect no significant French political interest. 
 
19. (C) As with Chissano, the French are positive about 
Nujoma\'s decision to retire, but only quietly so.  With 
friends like Eyadema and Deby, the GOF is hardly wedded to 
the notion of term limits for African presidents.  During 
Nujoma\'s last visit to France, he sought a meeting with 
Cooperation Minister Darcos, causing concern in the GOF about 
a potentially long wish-list for assistance.  Instead, Nujoma 
told Darcos that he liked French goat cheese, and sought 
French assistance in developing a goat cheese industry in 
Namibia, a project the GOF is now embarking on. 
 
ZAMBIA, MALAWI, BOTSWANA, LESOTHO, AND SWAZILAND 
 
20. (C) Notwithstanding that French company Schneider 
Electronics was found guilty in February of bribing the 
former Chief Executive of the Lesotho Highland Development 
Authority in connection with the construction of the Lesotho 
Highlands Water Project, the case made no news in France. 
There have been no recent high-level bilateral visits to or 
from any of these five countries and GOF interest is minimal.

SUBJECT: FRANCE AND EAST AFRICA 
 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  France\'s principal long-term concern in East 
Africa is the management of its relations with Djibouti where 
it maintains a large permanent military presence.  The crisis 
in Darfur has prompted a more active French policy with 
regard to Sudan, but it remains largely a \"Chad problem\" for 
the GOF.  Elsewhere, France\'s engagement arises from its 
presence on the UNSC and its interests in addressing the 
crisis in the Great Lakes.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DJIBOUTI 
 
2. (C) The 2,873 French troops in Djibouti represents the 
largest permanent deployment of French forces outside French 
territory worldwide (3,267 troops in Kosovo and nearly 5,000 
currently in Cote d\'Ivoire are not permanent deployments). 
In addition to maintaining a presence in the region, the 
military benefits from the ability to engage in maneuvers 
using live rounds, practically impossible anywhere in 
metropolitan France.  France welcomes the U.S. military 
presence in Djibouti but is concerned about the increased 
terrorist threat level for the 6,000 French military 
dependents and the burden for its forces charged with 
Djibouti\'s external security.  France\'s dominant role in 
Djibouti leads them to expect that the USG inform France (as 
well as Djibouti) on all military operations initiated from 
Djiboutian territory.  Embassy Djibouti reporting notes that 
contact between French and U.S. diplomats and military 
officials on the ground is continual, with close cooperation 
and collaboration. 
 
3. (C) The French repeatedly express concern to us that our 
military presence should not provide Djibouti with a pretext 
to play the USG and GOF against each other in a bidding war 
for development assistance.  Whether coincidentally or not, 
following the announcement early in 2003, of a USD 31 million 
assistance package for Djibouti, the GOF announced a 30 
million Euro package roughly equivalent to our own at 
then-prevailing exchange rates. 
 
4. (C) As with a number of other African countries, France\'s 
relations with Djibouti are complicated by a French judicial 
investigation.  The Djibouti case concerns the 1995 death 50 
miles north of the Djiboutian capital of French judge Bernard 
Borrel.  Borrel was in Djibouti investigating the 1990 
bombing of the Cafe de Paris in Djibouti.  The Borrel affair 
became inflamed in April 2004, when an attorney for Borrel\'s 
widow implicated Djiboutian President Ismael Omar Guelleh 
(IOG) in her husband\'s death.  In response, Djibouti, which 
claims Borrel\'s death was the result of suicide, demanded 
that the GOF clear Guelleh, essentially requiring the 
executive branch to intervene in a judicial investigation. 
France refused, but subsequently assured IOG that he would be 
immune from questioning during his August 2004, and 
subsequent, visits to France as head of state. 
 
5. (C) Notwithstanding the view of French officials that IOG 
is an occasionally difficult partner, unlikely to use any 
form of assistance for the benefit of the Djiboutian people, 
France is reluctant to challenge Djibouti on human rights 
concerns.  For example despite consideration at senior levels 
of the GOF, the arrest in 2003 of imprisoned journalist Daher 
Ahmed Farah elicited no criticism by France.  Similarly, the 
GOF took no public position regarding the announcement by 
Djibouti in September 2003 of its intent to expel foreigners 
from the country. 
 
ETHIOPIA/ERITREA 
 
6. (C) France has no dog in the Ethiopia/Eritrea fight but, 
as a permanent Security Council member, is obliged to remain 
informed, if not engaged.  By way of illustration, we saw and 
heard nothing from the GOF regarding the violence in Gambella 
in December 2003.  Our limited contacts on the border issue 
have revealed a slight tilt in favor of Eritrea, including a 
suggestion that the USG, notwithstanding our strategic 
interests in Ethiopia, make some form of gesture towards 
Asmara.  With the situation currently still at an impasse, 
French officials have indicated a willingness to consider a 
reduction in UNMEE troop levels should the UNSYG so recommend. 
 
SUDAN 
 
7. (C) In what may be a post-modern Fashoda scenario, our 
contacts have repeatedly stressed to us that the GOF seeks to 
avoid complicating USG-led efforts to bring peace to Sudan. 
MFA officials have taken care to consult with us before, 
during, and after any travel to Sudan by French officials. 
We are repeatedly told that the GOS would never have taken 
steps towards peace with the SPLA absent the Sudan Peace Act 
and continued high-level USG pressure.  However, the 
emergence of the crisis in Darfur, which for France is a 
problem because of its relationship with Chad, has obliged 
the French to be more active, leading to reports of bad 
feeling between USG and French diplomats in the field. 
France sees ties between Chadian President Deby\'s ethnic 
Zaghawa kinsmen and the Darfur rebels, and the refugees 
entering Chad from Darfur as potentially leading to the fall 
of Deby\'s regime. 
 
8. (C) Beyond their concerns for the stability of Chad, the 
GOF also fears that too much pressure on the Khartoum regime 
could cause it to fall, leading to either a Turabist faction 
taking control, or to a Somalia scenario in which there is no 
authority with which the international community could engage 
to end the conflict in Darfur.  The GOF is highly skeptical 
about the SLM and JEM rebel movements, asserting variously 
that their demands are unclear or unrealistic.  However, 
former FM de Villepin, during his February 2004 visit to 
Sudan, offered to host a conference to bring together the GOS 
and the rebels.  The GOS refused the offer and, with Villepin 
gone and talks having begun in Abuja, the offer is now almost 
certainly off the table. 
 
SOMALIA 
 
9. (C) Following a period of debate within the GOF post 9/11, 
based on the assumption that the USG might undertake military 
activity, French engagement on Somalia has been limited to 
pro-forma messages of support from President Chirac to TNG 
President Abdiqasim Salad Hasan (in March 2002), and to 
Abdallah Yusuf Ahmed (in October 2004) following his 
selection as President of the Federal Republic of Somalia. 
 
KENYA, TANZANIA AND UGANDA 
 
10. (C) Despite claims that France has broadened its Africa 
policy to engage with Anglophone states as well as former 
colonies and other French-speaking nations, French engagement 
with Anglophone east African nations is almost solely focused 
on the roles played by those countries in the Great Lakes. 
The French see Uganda as continuing to manipulate events in 
northeastern DRC, and occasionally express concern about 
Tanzanian support for Burundian rebel groups, or moves to 
refoule Burundian refugees.  The French know, and admit, that 
their influence is limited and seek to engage us and the 
British to influence Kampala and Dar on Great Lakes issues. 
 
11. (U) KHARTOUM MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

AMENDMENTS; ACTION REQUEST RE IPSI FOR AIR FRANCE 
 
REF: A. STATE 170673 
 
     B. PARIS 4556 
 
Classified By: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES ALEX WOLFF, EMBASSY PARIS 
FOR REASONS 1.4B AND D. 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST: Following considerable 
Embassy effort to bring about GOF coordination, the French 
Government finally has issued a directive requiring air 
carrier compliance with the No Fly and Selectee Emergency 
Amendments (EAs).  The directive effectively gives Air France 
(AF) the long-sought green light to implement security 
procedures described in the EAs issued by the U.S. 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), as modified by 
mutual agreement (reftels).  With French compliance on the No 
Fly and Selectee lists now in implementation,  Embassy 
requests that TSA reassign the procedural notification and 
air carrier contact function in cases where a French carrier 
has boarded a suspected no-fly passenger on a flight for the 
U.S., from the International Principal Security Inspector 
(IPSI) in Brussels to the TSA Attache in Paris.  Post,s 
experience with No-Fly cases in the month of November showed 
that the existing IPSI arrangement risks confusing lines of 
communication painstakingly worked out with the GOF regarding 
implementation of the EAs and GOF/French airline notification 
to the Embassy in No Fly cases.   END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) Colonel Henri Schlienger, Aviation Security, General 
Secretariat for National Defense (SGDN) informed the Embassy 
 
SIPDIS 
Paris TSA attach on December 13 that Prime Minister Raffarin 
had signed a directive to the French Border Police (PAF) and 
the Ministry of Transport to require French airlines, 
immediate compliance with outstanding Emergency Amendments on 
the use of No Fly and Selectee Lists.   The Directorate 
General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) issued a directive on 
December 10 to all French air carriers with flights to the 
U.S. to comply with the No-Fly and Selectee procedures. 
Economic Minister-Counselor confirmed with Air France 
officials on December 14 that they had received the 
directive. 
 
3.  (C) The issuance of the two directives by the Prime 
Minister and DGAC follows extensive Embassy efforts with the 
Foreign Minister, SGDN, the Interior Ministry, DGAC and Air 
France in recent weeks to bring about effective GOF 
coordination and the drafting of written procedures, insisted 
upon by Air France.  Embassy will monitor closely GOF and Air 
France implementation of the Emergency Amendments.  A 
follow-up meeting between Legatt, TSA, Econoffs and the 
Border Police (PAF) took place on  December 20.  Since then, 
AF and PAF have been huddling daily with TSA and Legatt to 
solve technical impediments. 
 
4.  (C) With full Air France implementation of the Emergency 
Amendments, Embassy sees the need to change the designation 
of the IPSI for Air France in cases where it is determined 
that a French carrier has boarded a no-fly passenger and 
French authorities must be notified.  The role of notifier in 
such cases is currently TSA Brussels.  However, post 
discovered during the three November No-Fly incidents 
involving Air France that the current arrangement risks 
confusing the lines of communication carefully worked out 
between Embassy Paris, the GOF and Air France for the 
handling of suspected No Fly and Selectee cases. 
 
5.  (C) Current TSA procedures have TSA Washington notifying 
the IPSI for a designated airline when that airline is 
suspected to have boarded a passenger whose name appears on 
the No Fly list.  In the two No Fly cases involving Air 
France on November 20, TSA Washington notification was made 
to the IPSI at TSA Brussels.  TSA Paris was only notified 
subsequently.  Our arrangement with the GOF and Air France, 
developed in conjunction with TSA Washington, relies heavily 
on communication between the Embassy (TSA, Legatt DCM), GOF 
(SGDN and PAF) and Air France.  The GOF has insisted that 
there be a strong GOF-Embassy connection in the 
implementation of the Emergency Amendments.  Unless Embassy 
Paris (via the TSA Paris attache) is notified immediately and 
directly by Washington of suspected No Fly violations, we put 
at risk effective coordination and cooperation with the GOF. 
 
6.  (C) ACTION REQUEST.  Embassy requests Department 
assistance in working with TSA Washington to reassign the 
procedural notification and the air carrier contact function 
of the International Principal Security Inspector (IPSI) in 
Brussels to the TSA attach in Paris, in cases where a 
suspected no-fly passenger has boarded a French carrier bound 
for the United States.  It is understood that this unique 
transfer of duties would give the TSA attach the sole 
responsibility of contacting the designated air carrier and 
resolving any issues concerning suspected no-fly and selectee 
passengers thus streamlining communication between the USG, 
GOF and Air France.

SUBJECT: FRANCE AND THE INDIAN OCEAN STATES 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  The standoff in 2002 between Marc 
Ravalomanana and Didier Ratsiraka following the disputed 
election in Madagascar was a serious political crisis for the 
government of France, exposing divisions between the MFA and 
the presidency.  With the crisis resolved, France\'s attention 
to the Indian Ocean states is largely focused on economic and 
development issues, in large part resulting from the 
proximity of the French territories of Mayotte and Reunion to 
the Comoros and Seychelles respectively.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MADAGASCAR 
 
2. (C) The French response to the Madagascar crisis during 
the first six months of 2002 revealed a relatively rare 
glimpse of inter-agency rivalry within the GOF, specifically 
between the MFA and the Presidency.  The crisis produced a 
notable casualty when Michel Dupuch, President Chirac\'s 
advisor on African affairs resigned his position July 5 
following then-FM de Villepin\'s travel to Antananarivo to 
confer French recognition on Marc Ravalomanana.  Although the 
crisis straddled the change of leadership at the MFA 
following French elections in April 2002, the MFA recognized 
early in the crisis that Ravalomanana was likely to emerge 
victorious from the standoff with Didier Ratsiraka.  However, 
at the Presidency Dupuch, and possibly Chirac himself, were 
unwilling to dump Ratsiraka.  The stated reason was that 
France (and the U.S.) should not get ahead of the OAU, which 
was reluctant to accept Ravalomanana\'s victory.  It is also 
likely that decades of personal contact and friendship 
between Chirac and Ratsiraka also played a role in the 
Elysee\'s disinclination to support Ravalomanana.  If Dupuch 
was the loser, Stanislas de Laboulaye, who was the French 
Ambassador during the crisis, and reportedly argued in favor 
of accepting Ravalomanana\'s victory, was a winner.  Following 
French recognition of Ravalomanana in July 2002, Villepin 
appointed Laboulaye (an ENA classmate) as the MFA political 
director (P-equivalent), a post he still occupies. 
Meanwhile, Ratsiraka is in exile in the Paris suburbs, 
apparently on the condition that he \"behave,\" i.e., that 
there be no repetition of the June 2002 chartered flight 
carrying twelve mercenaries destined for Madagascar, which 
obliged Villepin to intercede with the government of Tanzania 
to ensure that they were turned around in Dar es Salaam. 
 
3. (C) With 24,000 French nationals (60 per cent of whom are 
dual nationals) in Madagascar, the GOF is doubtless pleased 
to have moved beyond the crisis.  France has made efforts to 
establish a working relationship with Ravalomanana, 
notwithstanding initial concerns about his and his 
supporters\' religious fervor, his lack of fluency in French 
and his origins as a businessman.  The French were pleased to 
see Ravalomanana attend the France/Africa summit in France in 
February 2003 and again in August this year to commemorate 
the 60th anniversary of allied landings in southern France. 
Chirac will attend the summit of Indian Ocean states in March 
in Antananarivo, having already been to Madagascar, stopping 
in Antananarivo in July this year in conjunction with his 
summer vacation.  The MFA claims that Ravalomanana has joined 
other Chirac friends such as Gabon\'s Bongo and Congo/B\'s 
Sassou as recipients of Chirac\'s warm embraces.  The MFA 
views the situation for Ravalomanana\'s TIM party and its 
allies as fragile, but notes that notwithstanding traditional 
Malagasy views about land, the GOM has taken courageous steps 
in creating conditions for foreign ownership. 
 
COMOROS 
 
4. (C) The GOF is supportive of a Federal structure for the 
Comoros under the Fomboni accords, as exemplified by the 
refusal of French ministers to meet with Anjouan President 
Mohammed Bacar during his visits to Paris.  The GOF has been 
discouraging Bacar\'s desire for an independent Anjouan and 
views him as overly authoritarian.  Unfortunately for France, 
they find the Federal government incompetent, not even able 
to produce a budget for review by the IMF.  About the only 
thing the government can do, an MFA contact told us, is to 
pursue Comoros\' territorial claim to Mayotte.  MFA contacts 
occasionally remind us that Comoros is the closest African 
country to France, just over 100 miles from the French 
territory of Mayotte (claimed by Comoros).  They express 
concern about the strong presence of Madrasa schools 
established by individuals coming from Saudi Arabia, Sudan, 
and Pakistan, which preach extreme pro-Islamic, anti-western 
tenets to Comorian youth.  France is also concerned about 
trafficking of goods and money laundering in the Comoros as 
well as \"boat people\" seeking to flee to Mayotte.  The MFA 
claims that there are 40,000 clandestine Comorians in Mayotte 
and that 70 per cent of the births in Mayotte are to Comorian 
mothers.  The GOF is concerned about the drain on welfare 
resources caused by these illegal immigrants and the growth 
of violence, including by vigilante groups against the 
Comorians. 
 
MAURITIUS 
 
5. (C) MFA contacts told us in February 2004 that the visit 
to France of Mauritian PM Paul Berenger had gone very well. 
They noted with satisfaction that FM Cuttaree did not share 
the anti-French sentiments of his predecessor Anil Gayan. 
French interests in Mauritius are essentially economic (given 
Mauritian engagement on WTO issues) and commercial, although 
both countries are engaged on the issue of Comoros. 
 
SEYCHELLES 
 
6. (C) After 27 years of rule by Albert Rene, new President 
James Michel is relatively unknown to the French.  The GOF 
sees much of the Seychelles\' economy dominated by Rene 
cronies, with the majority of Seychellois economically 
marginalized.  France views the economic situation in the 
Seychelles as very bad, with almost all commerce under the 
control of the Seychelles Marketing Board.  The MFA drew an 
analogy with Cuba, saying that there were constant food 
shortages.  The French also have concerns about the political 
situation, fearing that elections scheduled for 2006 will go 
badly.

SUBJECT: FRANCE AND CENTRAL AFRICA (SOUTH) 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  France continues to seek solutions for the 
crisis in the Great Lakes through policies designed to 
support DRC President Kabila and the transition process and 
to block Rwandan interference in Congolese affairs.  France\'s 
history in the Rwandan genocide complicates their ability to 
engage with Rwanda, leading the GOF, whether by inclination 
or out of necessity to seek P3 cooperation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC) 
 
2. (C) French President Chirac believes that DRC President 
Joseph Kabila is \"a decent man who deserves support...part of 
the solution...a man of the future\"  Coupled with continuing 
suspicion between Paris and Rwanda\'s \"anglophone, Tutsi\" 
leadership, Chirac\'s belief informs the French policy process 
regarding the Great Lakes region.  Our MFA contacts feel that 
Kabila is doing as well as can be expected, but is poorly 
advised by the \"dinosaurs\" in his entourage who want him to 
assume total control, at the expense of his four 
Vice-Presidents, something the GOF feels would imperil the 
transition process. 
 
3. (C) The GOF acknowledges that the presence in DRC of the 
ex-FAR/interahamwe has provided a pretext (not a 
justification) for military operations by Rwanda and/or its 
surrogates, principally the RCD/G.  Accordingly, the French 
have focused on the need for credible DDR programs, 
occasionally suggesting that such programs be coupled with 
the establishment of a buffer force along the DRC/Rwanda 
border,  all of this to be undertaken by the UN.  Thus, we 
have seen consistent French support for increased MONUC force 
levels with a vigorous Chapter VII mandate. 
 
4. (C) The French are proud of their leadership of the EU\'s 
operation Artemis in Bunia during the summer of 2003.  Asked 
by UNSYG Annan in May to intervene until sufficient UN forces 
could be deployed, Chirac laid down several conditions, 
including UNSC approval, participation by British troops, and 
U.S. and UK political support to ensure cooperation from 
Uganda and Rwanda.  With these conditions met, Chirac ordered 
a reluctant military to deploy.  The French military had 
expressed a desire to solicit U.S. military assets for the 
mission, but the MFA, perhaps fearing a rebuff or the opening 
of a debate on Berlin-plus, finally confirmed to us that the 
GOF was not seeking any USG contribution beyond political 
support.  By September, at the end of the mission, Defense 
Minister Alliot-Marie was bragging about the total success of 
the French-led operation.  However, when Belgian FM Michel 
suggested in June 2004 that the EU might send troops to the 
Kivus, the French had no appetite for a reprise of operation 
Artemis, insisting that MONUC deal with the fighting. 
 
5. (C) With many in the GOF believing that the U.S. and the 
UK tacitly or implicitly blessed the 1998 invasion of the DRC 
by Rwanda and Uganda, the French now see U.S. policy on the 
Great Lakes as converging with their own.  The French are 
also pleased to see the back of UK International Development 
Secretary Clare Short, seen in Paris as an unconditional 
 
SIPDIS 
supporter of Rwanda and a persistent thorn in their side on 
Great Lakes issues. 
 
6. (C) A number of factors have led to what we believe has 
been a reduction in the level of French activism on Great 
Lakes issues.  First, France\'s problems in Cote d\'Ivoire 
have, at times, been all-consuming for senior French Africa 
policy-makers.  The transfer of Ambassador Levitte, who was 
heavily engaged on the Great Lakes, from New York to 
Washington, and the subsequent departure of Dominique de 
Villepin, a committed Africanist, from the Quai d\'Orsay has 
also affected French engagement.  The French have been 
seeking for some time to organize a joint visit to the Great 
Lakes region by FM Barnier and UK Foreign Secretary Straw, 
possibly including other Europeans, but no mutually 
acceptable date has been found.  Given their difficulties 
with Rwanda (see below) we anticipate that the GOF will 
continue to seek to coordinate policies on the Great Lakes 
with Washington and London. 
 
RWANDA 
 
7. (C) The French believe they have made several efforts in 
recent years to overcome difficulties with Rwanda arising 
from their support of former President Habyarimana, the 1994 
genocide, and the role played by French forces in \"Operation 
Turquoise.\"  In August 2001, during the first visit to Rwanda 
by a French Foreign Minister since the genocide, Hubert 
Vedrine claimed to have \"broken the ice\" with the Rwandans by 
raising the effect of the genocide in France.  While 
complaining about the portrayal of France\'s role in Rwandan 
media, Vedrine told the Rwandans that the genocide had 
traumatized France as well as Rwanda.  In Paris, commentators 
noted that Vedrine made no apology and attended no ceremony 
to pay respects to the victims of the genocide.  Vedrine 
returned to Kigali in January 2002, accompanied by UK Foreign 
Secretary Straw, who delighted the French by delivering a 
 
SIPDIS 
tough message to President Kagame on the need to end the 
Rwandan presence in eastern Congo. 
 
8. (C) Visiting Rwanda in September 2002, FM de Villepin also 
claimed to have had a positive meeting (in English) with 
Kagame, notwithstanding the vehement criticism by the 
then-permrep Jean-David Levitte of Rwanda\'s role in the May 
massacres in Kisangani.  Meanwhile, Kagame filed a lawsuit 
in Paris against Paris-based Cameroonian author Charles Onana 
for defamation.  Onana\'s book, \"The Secrets of the Rwandan 
Genocide,\" asserts that Kagame\'s Rwandan Patriotic Front was 
responsible for the downing of Habyarimana\'s plane on April 
6, 1994 - the event generally accepted as the trigger for the 
launching of the subsequent genocide.  A separate French 
judicial investigation, on behalf of the widows of the French 
pilots, was leaked to the French press in March 2004, also 
implicating Kagame.  With the tenth anniversary of the 
genocide approaching, the French were concerned by the timing 
and pressed the Rwandans for assurances that their 
representative at the commemoration ceremonies not be 
subjected to anti-French rhetoric.  Despite Rwandan 
assurances, Kagame delivered an anti-French diatribe at the 
commemoration ceremony, causing the French representative, 
junior minister Muselier, to cut short his visit to Rwanda 
and, according to the MFA, undoing Villepin\'s efforts to 
establish a working relationship with Kagame. 
 
BURUNDI 
 
9. (C) Perhaps scarred by their experiences in Rwanda, the 
GOF was unreceptive to USG efforts in 2001/2 to coordinate 
contingency planning for potential mass killings in Burundi. 
The French response was \"if you plan for it, you ensure it 
will occur.\"  French interest in Burundi briefly peaked in 
October 2002, following a call from Nelson Mandela to Chirac 
requesting funding for the deployment of an army of troops 
from Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya to engage the Burundi 
rebels military, an idea French officials characterized as 
\"crazy.\"  Mandela\'s request came to nothing.  However, France 
did provide training for Ethiopian and Mozambican troops 
participating in the African Mission in Burundi (AMIB), but 
felt unable to offer financing or logistical support.  With 
significant expenses associated with French and African 
deployments in Cote d\'Ivoire, an MFA official described 
Burundi as being in the \"third circle\" of French interests in 
Africa.  With no national funding available, France did, 
however, push EU partners to provide financial support to 
AMIB. 
 
10. (C) The French had a high regard for the efforts of 
Pierre Buyoya while President to move the political 
transition in Burundi forward.  In contrast, the GOF was 
skeptical about the qualities of then-Vice President Domitien 
Ndayizeye.  Thus, the French were surprised by the positive 
impression Ndayizeye left, following his January 2004 visit 
to Paris as President. 
 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO (BRAZZAVILLE) 
 
11. (C) Congolese President Denis Sassou-Nguesso is a regular 
visitor to France, both for vacations and for meetings with 
Chirac with whom he enjoys warm relations.  Sassou\'s ideas, 
including on regional disarmament are taken seriously in 
France.  However, in early 1994 Chirac\'s African affairs 
advisor undertook a mission to Brazzaville to deliver a 
message to Sassou that he needed to adopt a more constructive 
attitude in implementing the peace and disarmament agreement 
with the armed opposition and in his dealings with the IMF. 
It should be noted, that Sassou, like Gabonese President 
Bongo (to whom he is related by marriage) is closely tied 
into the Franco-African Masonic network. 
 
12. (C) Yet another French judicial investigation has 
impacted on the bilateral relationship.  However, the inquiry 
into the circumstance into the May 1999 so-called Brazzaville 
Beach affair concerning the disappearance and probable 
killing of approximately 350 refugees was dismissed by a 
French court on November 22, 2004, essentially because the 
Congolese officials under scrutiny had no residence in France. 
 
GABON 
 
13. (C) Any visit to Paris, of which there are many, by Omar 
Bongo (aka Omar El-Haj Bongo Ondimba) is the occasion for a 
long procession to the Hotel Meurice of ministers, 
politicians, businessmen and industrialists all paying court 
to the Gabonese President.  Bongo sees Chirac whenever he 
wants to, and reportedly even advises Chirac on his 
ministerial appointments and other domestic French affairs as 
well as on African issues.  His tenure as President second by 
only a few months to the Dean of the African dictators, 
Togolese President Eyadema, Bongo and Chirac have known each 
other for decades.  Bongo can count on French support 
whenever he faces difficulty with the IFIs and Chirac can 
count on Bongo to engage in a manner useful to France in 
regional crises, as Bongo has done recently in Madagascar and 
the Central African Republic.  While, on assuming their 
duties as Foreign Minister, both Villepin and Barnier 
included Libreville among their first stops in Africa, any 
issues of importance to Gabon and France are discussed 
between the offices of each country\'s President. 
 
SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE 
 
14. (C)  While there is constant speculation in the French 
press about alleged USG plans to establish a military 
presence in Sao Tome, French officials have candidly 
described Sao Tome as unimportant to France.  Following the 
coup in July 2003, the MFA issued statements of condemnation, 
but neither Chirac nor Villepin were personally engaged. 
 
EQUATORIAL GUINEA 
 
15. (C) France\'s principal concern regarding Equatorial 
Guinea (EG) is the boundary dispute with Gabon over the islet 
of Mbane/Mbanie.  According to French officials, Gabonese 
President Bongo sees EG as the \"little brother\" which, due to 
its booming petroleum and gas revenues, has become the \"big 
brother.\"  Beyond making the MFA\'s archives available to the 
UN mediator, France is careful to take no position on the 
legitimacy of either sides\' claim.  They were thus offended 
by former Spanish FM Palacios\' declaration in favor of EG\'s 
claim.

SUBJECT: GOF LAUNCHES ANOTHER PROPOSAL TO FOSTER MORE 
MODERATE \"FRENCH\" ISLAM AMID FRENCH MUSLIM COUNCIL DISARRAY 
 
REF: 2003 PARIS 3213 
 
Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt, reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Internal power struggles continue to plague 
the Council for the Muslim Faith (CFCM), the GoF-created 
umbrella organization which serves as the official French 
Muslim interlocutor with the government.  Meanwhile, in the 
political arena, two leading contenders in the 2007 
presidential race have offered competing proposals to foster 
the integration of France\'s estimated five to seven million 
Muslims.  Newly-elected President of the Union for a Popular 
Movement (UMP) Nicolas Sarkozy has advocated that the seminal 
law of 1905, which officially separated the church from the 
French state, be amended to allow for the state to finance 
mosques and train imams. Interior Minister Dominique de 
Villepin followed with a counterproposal to create a 
state-supervised foundation that would oversee the collection 
of money for the construction of centers of worship and 
expand efforts to educate imams in the French language, 
institutions, and culture. The main objectives of the 
Villepin plan are to foster a more moderate \"French Islam\" 
through training of imams which could eventually become a 
condition for visa issuance, and to seek greater control over 
foreign and domestic financing of Islamic projects (including 
mosque construction and halal meat sales) in France.  Though 
MOI officials stress that the Villepin plan will begin slowly 
and expand gradually, the same officials suggest a \"take it 
or leave it\" approach with opponents of the plan, including 
the fundamentalist-leaning Union of Islamic Organizations of 
France (UOIF).  End summary. 
 
CFCM SPLIT 
---------- 
 
2.  (U) The CFCM has been beset by infighting, based both on 
doctrinal and national origin differences, since its creation 
by then-Minister of Interior Nicolas Sarkozy in April 2003 as 
an official interlocutor for the Muslim faith with the GoF 
(ref A).  New elections to the council are expected to occur 
on June 5, 2005.  Current president Dalil Boubakeur has 
announced that he will not run for re-election and it is 
unclear whether delegates from his moderate Federation of the 
Grand Mosque of Paris will participate in the June vote. 
Boubakeur has argued that the CFCM\'s rules penalize his 
federation and favor the more radical UOIF and National 
Federation of French Muslims (FNMF).  In addition to the 
differing degrees of orthodoxy espoused by France\'s three 
principal Muslim groups, each is also aligned with a 
different country or outside movement, which tends to 
intensify differences.  Boubakeur and the Grand Mosque are 
linked with the Algerian government, while the FNMF is close 
to Morocco, and the UOIF maintains ties to the Muslim 
Brotherhood and, according to press reports, garners 
significant funding from Saudi and Gulf donors. 
 
3.  (U) Boubakeur\'s position was weakened in September when 
he was unable, for health reasons, to take a leading role in 
French Muslim efforts to assist in the liberation of the 
French hostages in Iraq.  Instead, leaders from the UOIF and 
FNMF took center stage in the highly publicized mediation 
attempts.  Further injury was added to insult when the head 
of the Moroccan-linked FNMF met and openly embraced Abbas 
Madani, exiled founder of the radical Algerian Islamic Front 
of Salvation (FIS).  Meanwhile, comments by Interior Minister 
Villepin suggest increased impatience with CFCM infighting 
and questioning of its relevance, which may reflect concern 
about a radicalized CFCM emerging from its June elections. 
In a recent interview, Villepin asserted that the CFCM did 
not represent the \"diversity and moderation\" of Islam in 
France, and that some 40 percent of French Muslims were not 
affiliated with the main groups making up the CFCM. 
Villepin\'s criticism is partly motivated by a desire to 
upstage his predecessor at the Interior Ministry, ruling 
Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) President Nicolas Sarkozy. 
 
SARKOZY PROPOSAL 
---------------- 
 
4.  (U) Just prior to leaving his position as Finance 
Minister in the Chirac government,  Sarkozy published a book 
titled \"La Republique, les religions, l\'esperance\" (The 
Republic, Religions, Hope). In it Sarkozy proposed changing 
the 1905 law that formally separated church and state in 
France in order to permit state funding of Muslim religious 
institutions thereby lessening the influence of Arab States 
and radical movements on France\'s Muslim population.  Sarkozy 
argues that Islam was almost non-existent in France prior to 
1905 and thus was not considered, as were the Christian and 
Jewish faiths, in the law\'s dispositions.  Sarkozy has also 
advocated affirmative action proposals (\"positive 
discrimination\" in French) to provide opportunities for 
minorities, particularly Muslims.  (Note: President Chirac 
has rebuffed publicly the idea of \"positive discrimination\" 
as contrary to republican values and encouraging 
sectarianism.  End note.) 
MOI ON VILLEPIN PROPOSAL 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Newly appointed Ministry of Interior Cabinet Advisor 
on Religious Affairs Michel Lafon recently briefed us on 
Villepin\'s various plans to foster a more moderate \"French 
Islam\" and keep better tabs on financing of Islamic projects 
in France.  Lafon prefaced his remarks by criticizing the 
legacy of Villepin\'s MOI predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, whom 
Lafon described as having created the CFCM in a rushed 
fashion, \"by forceps.\"  As a result, in Lafon\'s view, the 
CFCM was known more for its internal discord rather than 
concrete accomplishments.  One of Villepin\'s first actions as 
Interior Minister was to bluntly tell the CFCM members that 
they had to work together, come up with a plan of action, and 
reverse the organization\'s negative image.  According to 
Lafon, the CFCM\'s most pressing problem was not how to 
resolve the elections dispute between Boubakeur and other 
organizations, but rather to demonstrate the CFCM\'s 
usefulness to the French public.  (Comment: Lafon\'s 
dismissiveness of the CFCM did not square with Villepin\'s 
heavy reliance on the organization in the initial GoF 
response to the crisis involving two French journalists in 
Iraq last August.  In this instance, the CFCM not only sent a 
delegation to Baghdad, but offered a united front against the 
hostage-takers\' initial demands that France rescind its ban 
on religious symbols.  This CFCM position of solidarity with 
the GoF, particularly by the powerful UOIF component, which 
had been a vocal opponent of the headscarf ban in schools, 
eased the start of the fall 2004 school year for the GOF. 
Upon liberation of the hostages on December 21, the hostage 
takers cited intervention from Muslim groups as a factor 
behind the release.  End comment.) 
 
6. (C) Adding to the criticism of Sarkozy, Lafon noted that 
Villepin arrived in office only to find a lack of clear-cut 
government intelligence on the realities \"on the ground\" 
involving the French Muslim community.  Villepin commissioned 
an urgent, 15-day study by French security services and 
police to determine the number of Muslim places of worship in 
France, who frequents such mosques, the number of Muslims 
relative to the overall French prison population, and other 
relevant indices.  Echoing remarks made by Villepin to the 
press, Lafon asserted that the MOI study found that of the 
approximately 1,200 imams in France, most were poorly trained 
and educated, 75 percent were not French, and only 30 percent 
of the total could speak French. (Note: Villepin has stressed 
other statistics in public remarks to suggest that France\'s 
Muslim population is more moderate than generally believed, 
including the claim that only 10 percent of France\'s 5 
million Muslims are practicing and that of the 1,685 mosques 
in France, less than 50 can be regarded as radical.  End 
Note.)  Lafon conceded that one surprise in the MOI study was 
the finding that some 45 to 50 percent of the French prison 
population is Muslim; the GoF had previously estimated this 
figure to be 30 to 35 percent.  The overriding implications 
of the MOI study were that the GoF had been too slow in 
responding to the need to assert greater control over 
financing of Islamic projects in France, and the need to 
ensure that imams in France speak French and are properly 
trained and conversant in French civic values. 
 
PLAN FOR STATE SUPERVISED FOUNDATION 
------------------------------------ 
 
7. (C) Lafon described the Villepin plan for establishing a 
state-supervised foundation as a means to ensure transparency 
and assert greater control over foreign financing of mosque 
construction in France, while remaining respectful of the 
principles of the 1905 law.  Lafon estimated the total of 
such foreign financing to be in the range of \"tens of 
millions\" of euros.  The proposed foundation, which Villepin 
publicly pledged to set up by April 2005, would accept both 
domestic and foreign donations on a voluntary basis; the GOF 
would not contribute funds to the foundation.  The foundation 
would be made up of three \"colleges,\" to include in group 
one, members designated by the CFCM; in the second group, GoF 
representatives from the ministries of Interior, Social 
Affairs, and Foreign Affairs; and in group three, \"persons of 
quality,\" who were of Muslim origin but known for their 
accomplishments in non-religious fields, such as sports, 
politics, the arts and entertainment.  Lafon noted that the 
President of the foundation would likely come from group 
three, with some input on the choice from the CFCM 
representatives.  He added that the MOI had made good 
progress in identifying potential participants in all three 
groups; the remaining questions to be settled were whether 
the UOIF would participate and which additional \"persons of 
quality\" might be invited to join the third group.  Offering 
an example of the type of person the GoF had in mind for 
group three, Lafon cited the captain of the French national 
rugby team, who is Muslim and had financed the construction 
of a local mosque. 
 
8. (C) Lafon asserted that the foundation would make 
decisions on matters involving the construction of new 
mosques as well as renovation of existing ones.  He expressed 
confidence that the foundation would be able to attract 
sizable funding, despite its voluntary nature.  According to 
Lafon, the GoF had already approached a number of unnamed 
Middle Eastern governments, and found them amenable to the 
idea of channeling donations through the foundation, which 
could help boost such governments\' image and ensure that 
donations did not fall into the wrong hands.  Villepin would 
continue to pitch the foundation during future visits to 
countries in the region.  Lafon did not offer a clear 
strategy on soliciting private foreign donors\' contributions 
for the foundation, beyond noting that a process of 
elimination would reveal which private donors were choosing 
the route of transparency via the foundation and which 
declined to cooperate.  He added that tax benefit schemes 
could encourage private and corporate donors in France to 
channel funds via the foundation.  While stressing that the 
foundation would begin slowly, Lafon expressed confidence 
that the foundation could have at minimum 10 million euros in 
donations on hand by summer 2005. 
 
9.  (C) Lafon said that in addition to foreign financing of 
mosque construction in France, the GoF was preoccupied by 
fundraising for muslim institutions through halal butcher 
shops.  Halal butcher shops are common in muslim neigborhoods 
throughout France.  The GoF is considering an official 
certification process to insure that meat sold as halal is in 
fact prepared according to religious precepts.  This 
certification process would be financed by per kilo surcharge 
on halal meat sold.  Collecting the surcharge would permit 
monitoring of any fundraising activities through halal 
butcher shops. Remaining proceeds would go to the foundation. 
 
TRAINING, FIRST VOLUNTARY, THEN VISA REQUIREMENT? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
10.  (C) An additional function of the foundation would be to 
promote training for France\'s some 1,200 imams, whom Lafon 
described as overwhelmingly non-French and not integrated 
into French society.  The high percentage of non-French 
speaking imams was unacceptable; French imams must learn 
French and French values.   The Villepin plan on training was 
twofold: on the one hand, theological education of imams 
should continue via private, non-governmental channels, such 
as the two theological institutes run by the UOIF and the 
more moderate Paris Mosque.  At the same time, the GoF wanted 
to expand education of imams in French law, history and 
language, which remained a governmental responsibility and 
could be offered via French public universities.  Lafon 
described a possible five-year education training program, 
under which trainee imams could study two years of French 
language and institutions at a university, and then proceed 
with three years of theological training overseen by 
institutions such as the CFCM or the still-to-be established 
foundation.  The first such two-year civics/French language 
university diploma programs would start in Paris in September 
2005, with about 60 to 70 students.  Plans were underway to 
expand the diploma programs to Marseille and Lyon. 
 
11.  (C) When asked how the GoF could seek to impose 
requirements on training for imams when no hierarchy existed 
in Islam on designation of imams, Lafon responded by 
referring to French visa law.  While the GoF would encourage 
participation in training courses on a voluntary basis in the 
next few years, it was conceivable that five years from now, 
the GoF could impose requirements for residence permits or 
visa issuance to exclude those imams who failed to have the 
necessary training or diplomas.  When asked how the GoF would 
then deal with French-citizen imams who lacked or rejected 
the training being promoted by Villepin, Lafon responded 
vaguely that French nationals would be expected to adhere to 
the laws of the republic and those who did not would be dealt 
with accordingly. 
 
TOUGH TALK ON UOIF 
------------------ 
 
12. (C) Lafon was relatively dismissive when asked about 
objections to the Villepin foundation plan from the UOIF, 
which has decried the foundation plan as an attempt to 
\"nationalize\" French Islam and insisted that its funding is 
largely French-origin and not dependent on foreign donors. 
Lafon reiterated that Villepin was taking a firm approach 
with the UOIF which would continue to \"exist\" only if it 
continued to respect the laws of the republic.  Lafon 
reiterated that Villepin\'s message to organizations like the 
UOIF was that if they were ready to work with the GoF, the 
GoF was ready to help them; if they rejected French 
republican values, the GoF would deal with them accordingly. 
Lafon cited as an example the imam of Venisseux, whom 
Villepin had expelled from France after the latter made 
public remarks citing religious justifications for spousal 
abuse. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (C)   Comment: We are at once impressed by and skeptical 
of the Villepin plan.  On the one hand, the GoF is making an 
ambitious and far-reaching effort to offer education and 
training to foreign-origin imams, pursuing creative thinking 
to better track financing of Islamic projects in France, 
taking a firm stance against Islamic extremism, and seeking 
to broaden the role of prominent, secular French Muslims in 
representing the interests of France\'s varied and far from 
unified Muslim community.  At the same time, however, we see 
very flawed reasoning behind Villepin\'s apparent assumption 
that mere exposure to French language and culture will 
transform the thinking of imams in training and result in a 
moderate, uniquely \"French Islam.\"  Similarly, there is 
little reason to expect that the new foundation will be less 
prone to disagreement and bureaucratic inertia than the CFCM, 
unless the group is GoF-controlled to the extent that it 
loses all semblance of independence and legitimacy.  The 
voluntary nature of foundation donations also greatly limits 
the ability of the GoF to gain real control over foreign 
donors to Islamic causes in France, who may simply bypass the 
new entity. 
 
14. (C) Comment continued: There is an undeniable political 
dimension to the competing Villepin and Sarkozy proposals, as 
both men are widely viewed as leading contenders for the 2007 
presidential race.  Now out of government, Sarkozy has the 
luxury of touting his plans without having to show they work. 
 Villepin, however, is under pressure to show that his 
policies as Minister of Interior are effective.  Sarkozy\'s 
proposal called for modifying the near-sacrosanct 1905 law 
that codified the French Republic\'s particular version of 
separation of church and state. Villepin, in his proposal, 
opted to leave the law intact -- even though his proposal 
appears to violate the spirit of the law.  Additionally, 
Villepin, (moved by Chirac from the Foreign Ministry to 
Interior in order to bolster Villepin\'s credibility as a 
presidential contender), is under pressure to produce 
something concrete to address the Muslim issue. His previous 
efforts in the area have stumbled, including having to deport 
the same imam twice, after French courts overturned his first 
attempt.  Villepin appears determined to distance himself 
from the Sarkozy-created CFCM and go one step further with 
his foundation in order to embellish his credentials and 
prove himself effective in the run-up to 2007.   End comment.

ns 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (U) MFA desk officer for Ukraine Benoit Fremont described 
French satisfaction that the re-run of the second round of 
the Ukrainian presidential election had been conducted freely 
and fairly.  Fremont agreed that while there had been some 
problems with the balloting, the level of fraud had not begun 
to approach that seen in November.  Fremont did note the 
French Embassy\'s expectation that the Yanukovych camp may 
seize on the change in rules governing the use of the mobile 
ballot boxes, which saw several problems in implementation. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Fremont noted particularly the importance of 
Russia\'s willingness to accept the election results and 
Yushchenko\'s savvy decision to make his first foreign visit 
to Moscow.  He also praised Yuschenko\'s intention to build a 
type of national unity government that would include 
Yanukovych supporters, thereby increasing the stakes those 
opposing Yushchenko will have in the new government. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Fremont denied that calls for eventual Ukrainian 
EU membership would grow so loud as to create problems within 
the EU.  Pointing out that the Union had just formalized its 
neighborhood policy at the Dec. 17 Council meeting, Fremont 
said, \"I don\'t think the question of Ukraine will divide the 
25.\" 
 
4.  (SBU) Fremont re-emphasized the appreciation the French 
had for the European negotiators -- in particular, High Rep 
for CFSP Solana, Lithuanian President Adamkus, and Polish 
President Kwasniewski.  He noted that Kwasniewski and Chirac 
had spoken by phone during the negotiations process, as had 
officials at lower levels within the MFA, and said that these 
efforts had helped to buttress the improving French-Polish 
relationship since Kwasniewski\'s early October visit. 
 
5.  (SBU) Meanwhile, Le Monde editorialized on Dec. 27 that, 
after the Baltics and Georgia, Ukraine had showed that 
\"autocracy was not the inevitable destiny awaiting peoples in 
the former Russian (sic) empire.\" It further said that it is 
not only Putin who needs to recognize that, but Europe as 
well, noting that Europe must \"aid Ukraine to do everything 
possible to develop a stable democracy and a modern economy.\" 
 
6.  (C) Comment:  It is unclear whether Fremont\'s assessment 
that the EU can easily handle Ukraine\'s European aspirations 
is wishful thinking or reflects the MFA\'s confident belief. 
Although the French -- along with the rest of the former 
EU-15 -- joined the new member states in encouraging the 
Ukrainians to stand up for democracy, the Quai\'s line will be 
that encouraging democratization and the establishment of a 
progressive regime in Ukraine does not automatically lead to 
consideration of Ukraine for candidate status in the near or 
mid-term -- far short of the wishes of Poland and other 
recent Central European entrants.  End Comment.

Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  Chad, where France maintains a permanent 
miltary presence, and the Central African Republic (CAR), 
where France is supporting military and economic reform are 
key countries for France\'s Africa policy.  The crisis in 
Darfur has caused concern in France about additional threats 
to the stability of the Deby regime in Chad.  France supports 
Deby, including in his apparent aim to win another term as 
President.  France has glossed over the manner in which 
Francois Bozize came to power in Bangui, and is working with 
CAR on training gendarmes and providing support in the IFIs. 
In Cameroon, the French see President Biya as a luckluster 
leader but, while trying to avoid involvement in the 
Cameroonian dispute with Nigeria over the Bakassi peninsula, 
are anxious to ensure that Nigeria complies with the ruling 
of the International Court of Justice.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CHAD 
 
2. (C) Seeing no credible candidates among the opposition, 
the French see Chadian President Idriss Deby as the best hope 
for stability.  MFA officials have made clear to us that 
their support for Deby would extend to supporting him when he 
decides to seek a further term as President.  Deby\'s problems 
with poor health have occasioned periodic visits to Paris for 
medical treatment.  Although President Chirac has offered the 
use of a French military hospital, Deby prefers to use the 
American hospital in the Paris suburb of Neuilly. 
 
3. (C) France has maintained a permanent military base of 
about 700 troops in Chad for many years.  The current number 
is just over a thousand, with French forces having been 
engaged in assisting NGOs providing relief efforts to 
refugees from Darfur.  France, which according to an MFA 
contact, owns half of N\'djamena, has been negotiating with 
the Chadians over the return of 90 per cent of the property 
as a form of assistance in kind, leaving the remainder for 
use by the French garrison. 
 
4. (C) France views the crisis in Darfur (see Reftel on 
France and East Africa) as a threat to the stability of Chad. 
 France sees Deby as caught between his ties to his Zaghawa 
kinsmen, who installed and maintained him in power and who 
are allied with the Darfur rebels, or acting as a national 
leader in the interests of all Chadians.  French officials 
also note that Deby can not put Chad in the position of 
opposing the Khartoum regime. 
 
CAR 
 
5. (C) Francois Bozize\'s coup in March 2003 brought an end to 
uncomfortable relations between Paris and former President 
Felix-Ange Patasse.  Patasse was variously described to us by 
French officials as unpredictable and unstable and his 
departure was no loss to the GOF.  Having financially 
supported the CEMAC troops who had replaced the Libyans in 
Bangui, France sent 300 troops to CAR to provide security 
immediately following the coup.  For several months, the GOF 
ducked the issue of whether Bozize should be addressed as 
\"Mr. President,\" but it was always clear that as soon as 
neighboring African leaders, particularly Gabon\'s Bongo, were 
on board, France would treat with Bozize as de facto head of 
state.  Meanwhile, France quietly exfiltrated Patasse\'s Prime 
Minister, Martin Ziguele who had taken refuge at the French 
embassy in Bangui and gave him asylum in France.  At the end 
of July 2003, FM de Villepin visited Bozize in CAR, finally 
confirming France\'s de facto recognition. 
 
6. (C) Despite the removal of Patasse, the French remain 
pessimistic about CAR.  They use every opportunity to ask us 
to support CAR in the IFIs, notwithstanding s.508 
requirements and are anxious to see the return of U.S. 
diplomats to Bangui.  France continues to support the CEMAC 
deployment in CAR as well as its own military presence which 
is engaged in training of gendarmes. 
 
7. (C) CAR had a brief spell in the glare of international 
publicity in February this year when Bozize agreed to a 
French request, coordinated with the USG, to welcome former 
Haitian President Aristide. 
 
CAMEROON 
 
8. (C) In September 2002, The GOF provided facilities for a 
discreet meeting among Nigerian President Obasanjo, 
Cameroonian President Biya and UNSYG Annan to discuss the 
disputed Bakassi peninsula.  The GOF, aware that Nigeria 
would suspect that France favored Cameroon, took pains to 
ensure that there was no French involvement in the meeting. 
In August 2004, with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) 
having ruled largely in Cameroon\'s favor, French officials 
expressed concern to us over Nigeria\'s failure to implement 
the ICJ decision.  The French also took the opportunity, 
notwithstanding their reservations about Biya\'s lackluster 
leadership, to press us on support for Cameroon in the IFIs. 
 
9. (C) As with several other long-serving African heads of 
state, Biya apparently benefits from Chirac\'s personal 
support as evidenced by the premature statement of 
congratulations from the Elysee on Biya\'s October 2004 
election victory even before the vote had been finalized.

     B) MERTEN-WALKLET TELCONS, EMAILS 9 DEC 04 AND SUBS. 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  While remaining firm in their request to 
eight U.S. carriers, operating under FAR 135 (commuter and 
on-demand operations) in French Caribbean territories to 
supply documentation supporting their requests for 
\"revalidation of any non-scheduled flight authorizations,\" 
French aviation officials have expressed their willingness 
to work with the U.S. carriers to try to avoid any 
interruption in service.  Indeed they have already reviewed 
and issued licenses to at least one of the carriers that had 
quickly moved to pull together the required paperwork. 
Nevertheless, the officials insist that U.S. carriers 
operating in the area make a good faith effort in producing 
the requested documentation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND 
----------- 
2.  (SBU) On 7 December, Econ Chief was contacted by 
representatives of Air Culebra, who alerted him to 
\"ridiculous\" demands which were being put on the carrier by 
representatives of the DGAC (French Civil Aviation 
Authority).  According to a letter to the operators from 
DGAC regional office for the French Antilles and French 
Guyana, \"following numerous incidents and accidents 
involving FAR 135 operators, the French Civil Aviation 
Authority (DGAC) has decided to set up an a priori control 
of these operators...compliance with ICAO Annex 6 part 1 
will be checked before issuing or revalidating any non- 
scheduled flight authorization.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) The Air Culebra rep said his carrier and other 
\"FAR 135 operators\" were being singled out for these demands 
in response to the FAA\'s refusal to re-license a French 
carrier based in St. Barthelemy earlier in 2004.  The Air 
Culebra rep subsequently sent a copy of the communication he 
had received from DGAC rep Franck Chong-Wa, based in Pointe- 
a-Pitre, Martinique, and telephoned on 8 December (and 
several times thereafter) to press for Embassy intervention 
with DGAC.  On 9 December, Econ Chief discussed the issue 
with Embassy Paris FAA representative who in turn started a 
dialogue with appropriate organizations within the FAA 
Washington D.C. and regional offices.  Econ Chief counseled 
the Air Culebra reps to contact the FAA regional office in 
Atlanta, which has responsibility for the FAR 135 operators 
in the Caribbean, and make their concerns known.  He also 
worked with Embassy Paris FAA rep to confirm that the DGAC\'s 
demands were consistent with the U.S.-France aviation 
agreement and to see whether French officials would agree to 
try to avoid an interruption in service. 
 
4.  (SBU) In response to the series of calls from Air 
Culebra and to refs. A and B, Embassy FAA rep contacted 
Maxime Coffin, DGAC, Head of Service, Technical Regulations, 
Safety Oversight, and Crew Training and Luc Lapene, DGAC, 
Deputy Head of Multilateral Affairs.  As a result of several 
exchanges with the DGAC officials, Embassy FAA rep learned 
from Coffin that Jean Marc Sansovini, DGAC, Regional 
Director of the French Antilles and Guyana, (based in 
Martinique) was aware of the Air Culebra case.  Coffin 
reported that Sansovini promised to do whatever he could to 
try to ensure that the companies would not be \"penalized\" by 
being forced to interrupt their service.  Nevertheless, 
Coffin added, the companies concerned needed to demonstrate 
that they were attempting to comply with the DGAC\'s requests 
for information.  The DGAC indicated that another 135 
carrier in receipt of the DGAC letter had already submitted 
their documentation with a review time of approximately one 
month.  DGAC could not provide a specific timetable for 
DGAC\'s investigation for each operator, but again emphasized 
that they would conduct their review in such a manner so as 
to not penalize the operator\'s service. 
 
5.  (SBU) On 23 and 27 December, Econ Chief telephoned Air 
Culebra\'s offices to speak with the rep that had insisted on 
Embassy intervention.  On both occasions there was no 
response and Econ Chief left a message requesting that an 
Air Culebra official call back to confirm that they were 
working to pull together the documents requested by the 
DGAC.  On 28 December, Air Culebra rep contacted the Econ 
Chief\'s office and stated that they had sent a letter to the 
DGAC requesting an extension of two weeks for full submittal 
of the requested documentation.  He said the airline had 
compiled all the required paperwork with the exception of 
the ICAO compliance letter.  He said it would be impossible 
for them to get that letter prepared before the first week 
of January 2005. 
 
COMMENT: 
------- 
6.  (SBU) In April 2004, the FAA requested the DGAC provide 
a review of the aviation safety oversight provided in the 
Departments of Guadeloupe and French Polynesia to determine 
whether it met minimum international standards established 
by ICAO.  A 14 September meeting in Paris resulted in a 
successful resolution to the request for a specific review 
of the DGAC\'s safety oversight in the DOMs and TOMs 
(Departements d\'Outre Mer and Territoires d\'Outre Mer). 
However, during this meeting the subject of N registered 
aircraft operating under FAR 135 in the French Territories 
was also discussed.  The DGAC noted that these aircraft 
appear to operate primarily in the French territories and 
rarely return back to the United States.  In effect, these 
operations could constitute seventh freedom passenger 
services which are not provided for in the U.S.- France open 
skies agreement.  DGAC reps expressed concern about the lack 
of oversight of these operators since they were \"U.S.-based\" 
FAR 135 operators.   At this meeting FAA emphasized that 
DGAC had the authority over these operators in their 
territory, just as the FAA has authority of foreign 
operators when they are in the U.S. or U.S. territories. 
The recent request by DGAC for information to revalidate the 
nonscheduled flight authorizations appears to be a direct 
result of the discussions which occurred in September.

RESPONSE IN AFTERMATH OF TSUNAMI 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  On December 29, poloff spoke with MFA India 
Desk Officer, Louis Vassy, about French victims of the 
tsunami of December 26 and French plans for humanitarian aid 
 
SIPDIS 
packages for the regions hit hardest by the disaster.  Vassy 
elaborated on the deaths and voiced concerns that the number 
of French casualties might rise drastically.  He also spoke 
about French plans to contribute 15 million Euros to United 
Nations and International Red Cross relief efforts; later in 
the day it was announced that the 15 million would be part of 
a larger 22.16 million Euro French relief package.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
French Victims and a Fear that the Worst is Yet to Come 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
2.  Vassy told us that there have been 20 confirmed French 
casualties as of December 29 from the tsunami -- 19 deaths 
occurred in Thailand and one in Sri Lanka.  While French news 
reports put the number of French missing at 90, Vassy said 
that the MFA fears that the number is higher and that the GOF 
is preparing for the possibility of a sharp increase in the 
number of French casualties.  The MFA announced that the 
number of French injured is 189.  The GOF has established 
hotlines to facilitate the identification of victims. 
 
---------------------- 
The French Aid Package 
---------------------- 
3.  On December 29, the French government announced details 
of an aid package for the victims in the affected region. 
The package totals 22.16 million Euros (US$30.1 million) of 
which 15 million Euros are allocated to humanitarian agencies 
of the United Nations and the International Red Cross; 1.56 
million will go to bilateral assistance in the form of 
equipment, rescue workers and other specialists; and an 
additional 5.6 million Euros will be offered as part of a 
European Union aid package (the French contribution is 
roughly 17% of the total EU aid package). 
 
4.  Prior to announcing the package, French Prime Minister 
Jean-Pierre Raffarin brought several ministers together to 
discuss relief efforts in the region to include Minister of 
the Interior, Dominique de Villepin; Minister of Finance, 
Herve Gaymard; Minister of Transportation, Gilles de Robien; 
Minister of Justice, Dominique Perben; and Minister of Health 
Philippe Douste-Blazy.  The ministers heard an account from 
French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier, who had just returned 
from his emergency trip to Sri Lanka and Thailand to assess 
damage and coordinate relief. 
 
5.  Outside of the official aid package, efforts are being 
made across France through local governments, NGOs and 
individuals to provide humanitarian aid.  In the next few 
days some 34 tons of food will be sent to the region through 
Catholic Relief and the French Red Cross; and the French NGO, 
Doctors without Borders, will send 40 tons of emergency aid 
supplies to Sri Lanka.

BETWEEN A NATION THAT CONSIDERS ITSELF THE SHERIFF OF THE

\"A GLOBAL RESPONSE TO A GLOBAL DISASTER\" 
PIERRE ROUSSELIN IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (01/04): \"AS WE 
WAIT FOR SOME SORT OF COORDINATION IN AID RELIEF, A NUMBER OF 
SCATTERED INITIATIVES ARE GETTING UNDERWAY. DOING MORE THAN 
YOUR NEIGHBOR SEEMS TO STEM MORE FROM A DESIRE TO GET 
RECOGNITION THAN FROM A DESIRE TO BE EFFECTIVE. AFTER SOME 
INITIAL DELAY, THE U.S. IS PUTTING ITS POWER AT THE SERVICE OF 
AID RELIEF. BUT ISN\'T INDONESIA, ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT, ALSO 
THE WORLD\'S MOST POPULATED MUSLIM NATION? WHATEVER ITS 
MOTIVATION, AMERICA\'S MOBILIZATION IS AN EXCELLENT THING, EVEN 
IF THE IDEA OF A `COALITION OF THE WILLING\' IS MORE 
APPROPRIATE TO FIGHT TERRORISM THAN TO BRING AID TO DISASTER 
VICTIMS. THE FACT THAT THIS NEW AD HOC COALITION WITH INDIAN 
OCEAN COUNTRIES HAS, IN PRESIDENT BUSH\'S EYES THE ADVANTAGE OF 
EXCLUDING THE UN AND THE EU, DOES NOT MAKE IT LESS EFFECTIVE. 
TRUE TO ITS PRINCIPLES, FRANCE CONTINUES TO PROMOTE THE UN. IN 
ORDER FOR THE GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THIS GLOBAL DISASTER NOT TO 
FAIL, THE AID MUST BE COORDINATED. PUBLIC OPINION CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHEN GREAT NATIONS FIGHT IN TIMES OF WAR; THEY

ANTI-AMERICAN INSURGENTS WHO ARE BEING RECRUITED ESSENTIALLY 
FROM THE SUNNI COMMUNITY ARE INCREASING THEIR MILITARY EFFORTS 
IN ORDER TO DERAIL IRAQ\'S ELECTIONS. INSECURITY IN BAGHDAD IS 
SUCH THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW UN OBSERVERS MAY BE 
ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB. THE NEWLY TRAINED IRAQI POLICE AND ARMY 
WHICH ARE NOT VERY MOTIVATED, POORLY TRAINED AND OFTEN 
INFILTRATED BY ISLAMIC TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, DO NOT APPEAR 
TO BE IN A POSITION TO BRING BACK SECURITY TO IRAQ. THE 
AMERICANS RARELY COME OUT OF THEIR PROTECTED ZONES, WHICH HAS 
THE ADVANTAGE OF LIMITING U.S. CASUALTIES BUT THE 
INCONVENIENCE OF CREATING A CLIMATE OF INSECURITY WHICH MAY 
LEAD TO A HIGH DEGREE OF ABSTENTION.\" 
 
TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS 
 
\"TRANSATLANTIC QUARRELS ON THE WANE\" 
ALEXANDRE ADLER IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (01/05): \"IT MAY 
BE THAT IN 2005 THE TRANSATLANTIC QUARREL WILL DIMINISH. FOUR 
EVENTS MAY HELP TO PAVE THE WAY. THE FIRST IS THE LIFTING OF 
THE CHINESE ARMS EMBARGO. THE EUROPEANS CAN ANSWER EVERY U.S. 
CONCERN IN THIS DEBATE. IF THE AMERICANS AND THE EUROPEANS 
FIND SOME GROUNDS OF UNDERSTANDING OVER THIS ISSUE, THEY WILL 
BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THE GEO-POLITICAL CHALLENGES 
OF A GREATER MAGNITUDE, SUCH AS THOSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE 
AMERICANS MAY HAVE TRIGGERED A CHAIN REACTION WITH THE 
ELECTION SEASON IN THE ARAB WORLD, EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE 
FOOLHARDY OR BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN A HIGHER MORALITY. AFTER 
THE ELECTIONS A NEW ERA WILL BEGIN. THIS MAY BE THE TIME FOR 
THE EUROPEANS TO BURY THE HATCHET AND BRING THE NEWLY ELECTED 
IRAQI GOVERNMENT THE HELP IT NEEDS. SUCH COOPERATION WOULD 
ALLOW GEORGE BUSH TO ENTER INTO A SPECTACULAR RAPPROCHEMENT 
WITH BERLIN AND PARIS, A RAPPROCHEMENT HE DESPERATELY NEEDS. 
WHILE AMERICA IS IN A POSITION OF EXPECTATION WHEN IT COMES TO 
IRAQ, IT IS SOMEWHAT THE OPPOSITE WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
PALESTINIAN ISSUE. HERE THE EUROPEANS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY 
APPRECIATE HELP FROM THE AMERICANS WITH THE ISRAELIS SO THAT 
THEY MAY RETURN TO THE FOREFRONT ON THE SEARCH FOR PEACE. 
ABOUT IRAN, AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS HAVE EVERYTHING TO GAIN BY 
PRESENTING A UNITED FRONT. AS FOR RUSSIA, IT IS NOT THE TIME 
TO TALK ABOUT A QUICK INTEGRATION OF UKRAINE IN EITHER THE EU 
OR NATO. WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IS TO TRY TO RECONCILE KIEV 
WITH MOSCOW. BUT ALL WILL DEPEND ON WASHINGTON\'S APPROACH TO 
THE FALLING DOLLAR. WITH THE PRESENT ATMOSPHERE OF ACUTE ANTI- 
AMERICANISM IN EUROPEAN OPINIONS, A UNILATERAL ECONOMIC 
GESTURE BY WASHINGTON WOULD NOT BE FORGIVEN, INCLUDING BY 
WASHINGTON\'S BEST FRIENDS. CONVERSELY, A CONCERTED GESTURE, 
LIKE THE ONE DECIDED BY THE PLAZA ACCORDS OF 1985 WOULD CREATE 
A SYMBIOTIC CLIMATE THAT WOULD HELP CARRY THE PREVIOUSLY 
MENTIONED ISSUES.\" LEACH

SUBJECT:  FRANCE: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: CHECK ON EURL AOG AERO- 
SPARES COMPANY REGISTERED AS BROKER UNDER ITAR 129 
 
REF: STATE 227984 
 
1. As requested in reftel, post conducted a site visit to French 
company EURL AOG Aero-Spares, to check on the bona fides of this 
company as a registered broker and to verify the physical 
location of the operation and the nature of the business that 
the company conducts.  Following paragraphs address questions 
posed in reftel. 
 
2. Can the company\'s address of operations be confirmed? Yes. 
The company is a sole proprietorship operated by Olivier Calvez 
from his home.  The address is 9 rue des Mesanges, 85600 
Montaigu, France, as indicated in reftel.  AOG Aero-Spares also 
leases a small amount of warehouse space at the Zone d\'Activites 
Mirville (Mirville Industrial Park), 85600 Bouffere.  It hopes 
to lease larger warehouse space in the near future, but will 
continue to operate the business from Mr. Calvez\' home. 
 
3. What type of business does the company conduct?  The company 
acts as a broker for the purchase and sale of parts for both the 
military and commercial versions of the C-130 aircraft (aka L- 
100 for the commercial version) and its T56 engine (aka 501D). 
The company has four principal customers -- Wood Group 
Turbopower (Florida), Rolls-Royce (Oakland, CA), SIGMA (UK), and 
Aviquipo (Portugal).  The company deals with both OEM and OH 
parts.  It does not do drop shipment transactions -- all parts 
are sent to AOG Aero-Spares which looks them over before sending 
them on to the end user.  Aero-Spares also does not certify 
parts.  Instead it forwards the manufacturer\'s original 
certification to the end user with the part. 
 
4. Does the company have a contractual relationship with any 
U.S. companies?   Yes.  AOG Aero-Spares acts as European sales 
representative for Wood Group Turbopower, Inc., 14820 NW 60th 
Avenue, Miami Lakes, Florida 33014. 
 
5. Does the company hold proper licensing to conduct business 
relating to military goods?  The company deals almost 
exclusively in dual-use items, as the same parts can be used on 
both the military and commercial versions of the C-130 aircraft 
and its engine.  The company is registered with the French 
Ministry of Defense.  On the rare occasions when the company has 
brokered transactions involving exclusively military parts, it 
has obtained a license from the French government for each non- 
French end user.  This is true even if the end user is another 
EU country.  In the case of military parts obtained in the U.S., 
the manufacturer is required to obtain the necessary export 
license from the State Department.

1.  (C) Poloff reviewed reftel points urging French support 
for the International Mission for Iraq Elections (IMIE) with 
MFA Iraq desk officer Bernard Chappedelaine January 5, after 
delivering reftel points to the GoF December 29. 
Chappedelaine reported that the GoF did not plan to 
participate in or offer direct support to the IMIE mission, 
and stressed that France would channel its contributions via 
the EU\'s 30 million euros donation towards Iraqi elections 
support.  He added that, unlike other countries on the IMIE 
steering committee, France did not have an electoral 
commission or other suitable independent interlocutor for the 
IMIE.  Chappedelaine cited security concerns as another 
reason for lack of French participation in the IMIE, despite 
poloff\'s emphasis that the IMIE would not be an observer 
mission in the traditional sense and would be Amman-based 
with short visits to Iraq (ref a). 
 
2.  (C) Chappedelaine stressed that, in addition to the EU 
financial contribution, the GoF was offering other forms of 
bilateral support for Iraq\'s elections.  As France was one of 
14 countries designated for out-of-country (OCV) voting in 
Iraq\'s elections, the GoF was working with the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) to select polling stations 
and provide statistics on the Iraqi community in France, 
which numbered in the low thousands.  IOM and French MFA and 
Ministry of Interior officials met for the first time in late 
December to discuss OCV Iraqi voting in France. 
Chappedelaine cited as a further example of French elections 
support a planned GoF program to welcome 14 officials from 
various Iraqi political parties (ref b for further 
background) for a familiarization program on the electoral 
process.  The exchange program, which had been originally 
proposed to last two weeks, had been scaled down to five 
days, and would overlap with the planned visit of Iraqi 
Interim Government President Ghazi al-Yawer to Paris January 
13-14. 
 
3.  (C) Comment: The GoF disinclination to contribute 
personnel to the IMIE is consistent with long-standing GoF 
reticence on sending additional French personnel, military or 
otherwise, into Iraq, even on a short-term basis.  As long as 
the security situation in Iraq remains difficult, we expect 
the GoF to continue to concentrate its modest offers of 
assistance to Iraq on France-based programs, similar to the 
January exchange program for political party representatives. 
 End comment.

1.  (SBU) Summary.  Working level French officials dealing 
with the tsunami are very pleased with and thankful for the 
excellent cooperation with the USG.  France will be 
represented \"most likely at the ministerial level\" at the 11 
January Geneva donors\' conference, however the GOF has not 
decided who will attend.  The French are still considering 
what they may be in a position to pledge at the conference, 
but our contact noted real budgetary constraints could limit 
further financial support. End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) On 5 December, Econ Chief discussed reftel points 
with Deputy Director for Southeast Asia, Christian Lechervy. 
Along with the points, Econ Chief had also shared the USAID 
fact sheet with Lechervy.  Lechervy commented immediately 
that the coordination between U.S. and French officials both 
in the region and elsewhere was superb.  He made particular 
note of the help French military officials had received from 
PACOM on an airlift on 5 January.  He singled out the 
Pentagon\'s help as noteworthy and much appreciated. 
 
3.  (C) Regarding GOF representation at the 11 January Geneva 
donors\' conference, Lechervy noted that France will certainly 
be represented, \"most likely at the ministerial level.\" 
However, whether it would be a minister from the Finance 
Ministry or from the Foreign Ministry (each ministry has a 
senior minister and several junior ministers) was still being 
thrashed out between the relevant agencies.  Separately, the 
on 5 January the MFA spokesman announced that Cooperation 
Minister Xavier Darcos would represent France at the 6 
January Jakarta meeting, adding that he had left for 
Indonesia the evening of 4 January.  The MFA had originally 
said France would be represented at the meeting by the EU. 
 
4.  (C) On a possible contribution, Lechervy said it was 
still too early for him to comment.  He said the GOF was 
watching to see how events developed and needs materialized 
over the coming days on the ground.  He also said the GOF 
would be watching closely the results of the 6 January 
Jakarta meeting.  In addition, the outcome of the General 
Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 7 January will also 
determine the GOF\'s position in Geneva.  Lechervy cautioned 
that France currently faces some real budgetary concerns.  He 
opined that France would look closely at any further 
financial support and may prefer to take measures such as 
relieving countries\' international debt or establishing 
reconstruction-related programs.  He added quickly, that the 
subject was still being widely discussed within the GOF and 
cautioned against our drawing any early conclusions about 
what the GOF might pledge in Geneva.  Lechervy said that he 
would have a clearer picture by 7 January.

PARIS - THURSDAY, JANUARY 06, 2005 
 
(A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY\'S REPORT: 
 
1. IRAQ 
2. TSUNAMI - HUMANITARIAN AID AND POLITICS 
 
B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
POLITICS AND HUMANITARIAN AID ARE TWO KEY WORDS IN MANY OF 
TODAY\'S COMMENTARIES, WHILE FRONT PAGES ARE MOSTLY DEVOTED TO 
DOMESTIC SOCIAL ISSUES. LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION IS AN 
EXCEPTION WITH ITS LEAD STORY ON IRAQ AND THE ELECTIONS, WHICH 
EDITORIALIST PATRICK SABATIER CONSIDERS WILL BE NOTHING MORE 
THAN \"AN ILLUSION.\" (SEE PART C) 
 
WITH REGARD TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE TSUNAMI DISASTER AND 
THE RELIEF EFFORTS UNDERWAY, SOME COMMENTATORS CALL FOR A 
\"TRUCE\" IN THE RIVALRY BETWEEN NATIONS (LA CROIX), OTHERS 
POINT TO U.S. \"ULTERIOR MOTIVES\" (LIBERATION) WHILE OTHERS 
STILL (LE FIGARO) EXPLAIN HOW \"A NATURAL DISASTER CAN ALSO 
LEAD TO DOING POLITICS DIFFERENTLY.\" (SEE PART C) 
 
THE HEARINGS ON THE NOMINATION OF ALBERTO GONZALES AS ATTORNEY 
GENERAL LEAD LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION TO TITLE ITS REPORT: 
\"AN ADVOCATE OF TORTURE TO HEAD THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN THE 
U.S.\" 
 
IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO PIERRE PRIER WRITES A REPORT ON 
\"A MYSTERIOUS ANTI-AMERICAN PLOT\" IN KUWAIT. \"IF THE PLOT BY 
KUWAITI SOLDIERS (AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS) IS VERIFIED, THE 
CONCERNS THIS WOULD TRIGGER WOULD SURPASS ANYTHING IMAGINED 
UNTIL NOW. IT WOULD CAST A DAUNTING LIGHT ON THE HOLD THE 
SUNNI DJIHAD HAS IN THE GULF AND ON THE FRAILTY OF REGIONAL 
OIL REGIMES. THE INFILTRATION OF THEIR ARMED FORCES IS THE 
ULTIMATE NIGHTMARE FOR THESE GOVERNMENTS.\" 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
IRAQ 
 
\"ILLUSION\" 
PATRICK SABATIER IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (01/06): \"IT 
WILL BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO PUT AN END TO THE SUFFERING OF 
THE IRAQIS CAUGHT IN THE WAR THAN TO THE SUFFERING OF THE 
SURVIVORS OF THE TSUNAMI. PRESIDENT BUSH IS NO LONGER TALKING 
ABOUT BRINGING DEMOCRACY TO IRAQ OR ABOUT REBUILDING THAT 
COUNTRY. HIS GOAL IS TO WITHDRAW HIS TROOPS FROM THE QUAGMIRE 
HE SENT THEM TO, BUT WITHOUT CONCEDING DEFEAT IN THE FACE OF A 
`NATIONAL ISLAMIC\' IRAQI RESISTANCE HE CANNOT BREAK. THE 
JANUARY 30 ELECTIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO OFFER A WAY OUT, WITH 
THE `IRAQISATION\' OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS SOLUTION MAY 
BE CUT SHORT BY THE INTIMIDATION TECHNIQUES USED BY TERRORIST 
GROUPS. IT IS NOT TOTALLY CERTAIN AT THIS POINT WHETHER THE 
ELECTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE. AND IF THEY DO, IT IS EVEN LESS 
CERTAIN WHETHER THEY WILL SERVE ANY PURPOSE. THERE IS NO OTHER 
CONCEIVABLE END TO THIS WAR THAN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A 
REGIME THAT FULLY REPRESENTS ALL IRAQIS AND IS ABLE TO SECURE 
THE COUNTRY ALL THE WHILE FREEING IT FROM FOREIGN OCCUPATION. 
BUT ORGANIZING ELECTIONS IN A COUNTRY AT WAR, WITHOUT ANY 
INTERNATIONAL CONTROL, WITH ONE FIFTH OF THE POPULATION 
EXCLUDED FROM VOTING BY EITHER TERROR OR THROUGH A BOYCOTT, 
WILL RESULT IN A REGIME THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED TO BE 
ILLEGITIMATE BY THE SUNNIS, AND THEREFORE THREATENED BY CIVIL 
WAR. IN SUCH A CASE THE ELECTIONS WILL BE NOTHING OTHER THAN 
AN ILLUSION.\"

\"SOLDIERS OF LIFE\" 
CHARLES LAMBROSCHINI IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (01/06): \"BY 
HELPING ONE OF THE COUNTRIES WITH THE LARGEST MUSLIM 
POPULATION THE U.S. IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
ERASE ITS IMAGE OF ENEMY OF ISLAM. AS OPPOSED TO THE 
INTERVENTION IN IRAQ, THE GIS ARE NOT COMING TO ASIA AS 
CONQUERORS BUT AS SAVIORS. SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE MARSHALL 
PLAN, THIS STRATEGY OF GENEROSITY RESPONDS TO THE SAME 
MOTIVATIONS. GEORGE BUSH\'S DECISION TO MULTIPLY BY TEN 
AMERICA\'S AID IS DEVOID OF ANY AMBIGUITY. THE U.S. SOLDIERS 
LANDING IN ASIA HAVE HERE NO REASON TO USE THEIR WEAPONS. 
WHEREAS IN VIETNAM THE AMERICANS WERE UNABLE TO CONQUER THE 
`HEARTS AND MINDS,\' THERE IS IN ASIA NO POSSIBILITY FOR 
CONFUSION. AS CLAUSEWITZ ONCE SAID, A NATURAL DISASTER CAN 
ALSO LEAD TO DOING POLITICS DIFFERENTLY.\" 
 
\"COMPETITION\" 
GERARD DUPUY IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (01/06): \"IN ASIA, 
THE U.S. IS FINDING AN UNHOPED FOR AND RESPECTABLE NEW WAY TO 
USE ITS WAR MACHINE, JUST WHEN ITS SUPERIORITY IS PRODUCING 
THE WORST POSSIBLE POLITICAL RESULTS IN IRAQ. BUT THOSE WHO 
CRITICIZE WASHINGTON\'S ULTERIOR MOTIVES HAVE SIMILAR 
INTENTIONS.\" 
 
\"A NEW WORLD ORDER\" 
BRUNO FRAPPAT IN CATHOLIC LA CROIX (01/06): \"FOR THIS REAL WAR 
IN THE NAME OF GOOD, THERE IS NO ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF, NO 
`MASTER OF THE WORLD.\' IN JAKARTA, WHERE A CONFERENCE IS 
ATTEMPTING TO ORGANIZE THE UNPRECEDENTED FLOW OF GENEROSITY, 
LET US TRY TO FORGET, FOR A TIME, ULTERIOR MOTIVES, RIVALRIES 
AND COMPETITION ABOUT THE `COMMUNICATION\' STRATEGIES WHICH ARE 
BEING ELABORATED.\" 
 
\"MAKING PROPER USE OF A DISASTER\" 
JACQUES AMALRIC IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (01/06): \"WHEN 
PRESIDENT BUSH BECAME AWARE THAT THE TSUNAMI DISASTER COULD 
HELP WASHINGTON PROJECT A MORE POSITIVE IMAGE OF THE U.S. ARMY 
TO THE WORLD THAN THE ONE COMING FROM IRAQ, HE TURNED THE 15 
MILLION DOLLARS INTO 350. NOTHING AS YET PROVES THAT THE 
DISASTER IN SOUTH ASIA WILL ALLOW WASHINGTON TO PROJECT THE 
IMAGE OF THE `EMPIRE OF GOOD\' AND TO ERASE THE IRAQI FIASCO. 
BUT THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY WE MUST PUT ON HOLD ALL OUR 
INDECENT RIVALRIES AND CONFIRM THE UN IN ITS ROLE AS SOLE 
COORDINATOR FOR THE EMERGENCY RELIEF EFFORT AND FOR THE 
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT NEEDS THAT WILL CONTINUE FOR 
YEARS.\" LEACH

1. (C) In the absence of MFA DAS-equivalent director for 
disarmament issues Francois Richier, we presented reftel 
demarche December 21 to the desk officer covering the office 
during the holidays.  On January 5, we met with Richier\'s 
deputy, Veronique Vouland-Aneini, who voiced skepticism that 
IAEA Director General ElBaradei could be prevented from 
pursuing a third term as DG.  She noted that France does not 
believe that Geneva Group policy on term limits applies (also 
see ref B).  She observed that the issue of a third term for 
ElBaradei is a political decision, while the Geneva Group\'s 
focus is on financial issues.  Technically, the IAEA is not a 
UN agency, which is another reason why the two-term limit 
does not come into play, she added.  On a more practical 
level, Vouland reminded us that no other candidates had 
surfaced prior to the December 31st deadline for nominations. 
 The MFA was therefore unclear how the United States could 
envision an alternate candidate emerging before the June IAEA 
meeting or whether we could muster sufficient support to 
block ElBaradei\'s own candidacy. 
 
2. (C) Despite these reservations, Vouland stressed that 
France has not/not yet decided how to handle ElBaradei\'s 
request for a third term.  While France has not taken a 
position, it plans to factor in the views of other Europeans, 
she added.  In response to our prodding, she said that the 
British might object to a third term, but that they likely 
would not want to maintain that position if other Europeans 
took the opposite view.  When pressed further, she said Spain 
may have decided to support ElBaradei, but she wasn\'t 
certain.  Vouland agreed to keep us informed as the French 
position is finalized.

1. (C) On January 5, MFA Disarmament Office Deputy Veronique 
Vouland informed us that the MFA had taken on board U/S 
Bolton\'s letter re Iranian processing activities (reftels). 
She said they had not been surprised by the letter, but she 
also did not indicate whether France agreed with our 
assessment.  She indicated that as Political Director 
Laboulaye had only returned from leave on January 4, a 
decision had not yet been made on how to respond to U/S 
Bolton.  The EU3 might respond individually or as a group, 
she added.  Vouland then provided the same general readout of 
the December 17 Nuclear Working Group and the December 21 
Political and Security Group meetings as provided by Embassy 
Berlin (ref C).  (Note: while Vouland did not indicate how 
the French would address Iran\'s uranium conversion work, as 
raised by U/S Bolton in his letter, it was clear from our 
discussion that the French believe continued discussions with 
the Iranians are the way to go.)

A/S-equivalent Director for Disarmament and Strategic Affairs

1.  (C) Summary: The investigation against four former GTMO 
detainees (reftels A and B) appears to be proceeding well; 
all appeals for pre-trial release have been denied and the 
investigating judges feel confident that the trial, likely to 
begin this summer, will result in conviction.   However, in a 
related action, France\'s highest appeals court for criminal 
matters overturned two previous courts\' decisions  and 
referred, to the Paris Court of Appeals for action, a 
complaint brought by the families of two ex-GTMO detainees 
requesting an investigation into their detention. 
 
2.  (C) Summary continued: Separately, the public trial 
against suspected terrorist Djamel Beghal and five 
accomplices accused of plotting to attack US interests in 
France, including an attack against the Embassy, began 
January 3.  Thus far, the trial has been highlighted by the 
defiance of the defendants during questioning.  Post will 
continue to report on these cases, as well as that of Mohamed 
al-Jundi, the Syrian driver of the two French journalists 
kidnapped in Iraq (septel).  Al-Jundi filed suit against U.S. 
forces alleging torture while in U.S. custody following his 
liberation from insurgent captivity.  End summary. 
 
EX-GTMO DETAINEES 
----------------- 
 
3.  (S) The ongoing investigation against the four ex-GTMO 
detainees currently in French custody is progressing well and 
the trial is likely to begin this summer.  Thus far, all 
appeals by defense attorneys for the release of their clients 
from pre-trial detention have been rejected.  A recent 
defense appeal to obtain transcripts from alleged 
interrogations by French authorities while the detainees were 
still at GTMO was similarly denied.  The anti-terrorism 
judges investigating the case communicate regularly with 
Post, and they are confident the evidence obtained by French 
authorities since the four were remanded to French custody is 
overwhelming. 
 
4.  (C) France\'s highest appeals court, the Cour de 
Cassation, ruled January 4 that the Paris Court of Appeals 
would have to address a complaint filed by the families of 
two former GTMO detainees seeking a criminal investigation 
into certain unknown and unnamed persons (undoubtedly U.S. 
officials) for the illegal detention of the two in 
Guantanamo.  The complaint had initially been filed in 2002 
and was dismissed by a judge in Lyon.  The Lyon Court of 
Appeals upheld this initial decision in 2003, arguing that 
that the detention could not be investigated because it was 
the result of an American military operation covered by a 
unanimously adopted UN resolution.  However, yesterday\'s 
appeal court decision indicated that the complaint could not 
be dismissed without investigating whether there was evidence 
related to the complaint that could be applicable under 
French law.  The complaint is now remanded to the Paris Court 
of Appeals, which technically could rule with the Lyon 
decisions, but will likely have to open an investigation 
itself or designate a judge to investigate the complaint. 
Media reports indicate that requests for U.S. judicial 
explanations are likely.  It is not yet clear how this 
complaint could affect the French investigation against the 
detainees.  Post will continue to follow the developments of 
this case closely. 
 
DJAMEL BEGHAL TRIAL 
------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The trial of six men suspected of plotting in Afghani 
terror training camps to target U.S. interests in France -- 
specifically, to bomb the US Embassy in Paris in 2001 -- 
began January 3.  The proceedings have thus far been 
dominated by combative responses from the defendants. 
Suspected cell leader Djamel Beghal, a 39-year-old 
Algerian-born French citizen who was arrested in the UAE in 
July 2001 after leaving Afghanistan, told authorities in 
Dubai that he was the head of an al-Qaeda-linked cell intent 
on attacking US interests in France, including the U.S. 
Embassy in Paris; however, Beghal later retracted his 
confession and told the chief judge in the trial that he had 
given it under \"methodical torture.\"  In Beghal\'s testimony 
he referred to himself in the third person, responded to the 
judge\'s questions with questions of his own, referred at one 
point to the proceedings as an \"Inquisition court,\" and 
refused to explain his reasons for visiting Afghanistan. 
Kamel Daoudi, arrested in Britain and extradited to France in 
September 2001, posed multiple definitions for the term 
\"jihadist\" and proclaimed his innocence as a terrorist, 
despite being arrested in possession of texts by Ayman al 
Zawahiri and other Islamic extremists, claiming that \"when 
someone reads \'Das Kapital,\' he is not necessarily a 
Marxist.\"  French authorities allege that Beghal admitted in 
questioning that Abu Zubaydah gave the order to attack U.S. 
interests in an Afghani terror camp in March 2001; both 
Beghal and Daoudi deny having met Zubaydah.  The trial is 
expected to last seven weeks, and if convicted, the six 
defendants face up to 10 years in prison.

SUBJECT: SYRIAN FORMER HOSTAGE IN IRAQ FILES LAWSUIT

REF: 04 PARIS 9098 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt, reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary and comment: French officials, in preliminary 
comments to us, stressed the strictly private nature of a 
lawsuit filed in a French court by a Syrian former hostage in 
Iraq, who accused named U.S. military officials of torture 
and war crimes during the weeklong period he was in MNF-1 
custody last November.  The MFA expert on ICC issues 
downplayed the potential for an ICC role in the lawsuit and 
stressed that French courts rarely take up cases where 
neither the plaintiff nor defendant has any ties to France. 
Other MFA officials conceded that the GoF had appealed to the 
Syrian former hostage not to go forward with the lawsuit or 
\"exaggerated\" allegations while two French hostages remained 
in captivity; the same officials stressed that, with the 
release of the French hostages, the GoF lacked the means to 
prevent the Syrian driver from pursuing his case, which is 
being advanced by a French lawyer known for notorious 
clients, including Tariq Aziz, Nazi war criminal Klaus 
Barbie, and terrorist Carlos (Jackal).  While it remains 
unclear whether French courts will accept jurisdiction in 
this case, the credibility and past history in Iraq of the 
Syrian accuser remain in doubt, with his latest allegations 
contradicting earlier public statements he made about his 
treatment by U.S. military officials last November.  End 
summary and comment. 
 
2.  (SBU) Mohammed al-Joundi, a Syrian driver taken hostage 
in Iraq with two French journalists in August and later 
rescued by U.S. troops in Fallujah in November, filed a civil 
lawsuit in a Paris court January 4 reportedly accusing U.S. 
military officials of torture and war crimes.  Post is 
seeking to obtain a copy of the lawsuit, which press reports 
describe as naming Commander of the 1st Marine Expeditionary 
Force in Fallujah GEN George Sattler, as well as other 
unnamed persons who may have committed or known about alleged 
mistreatment.  In a series of recent French media 
appearances, Al Joundi, speaking via an interpreter, accused 
U.S. troops of torturing him with electric shocks, 
threatening him with death, and striking him on the back, 
neck and feet during a weeklong detention following his 
discovery by U.S. troops in Fallujah November 11.  Al Joundi 
is represented by French attorney Jacques Verges, a longtime 
defender of extremist causes whose past and present client 
list includes former Iraqi Vice Minister Tariq Aziz, Nazi war 
criminal Klaus Barbie, Carlos \"the Jackal,\" and Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
 
3.  (C) Al-Joundi\'s status in France and basis for filing a 
lawsuit remain unclear; according to media reports, he 
arrived in Paris November 19, after the NGO \"Reporters 
without Borders\" appealed for the French government to bring 
him and his family to France because of security concerns in 
Iraq.  Attorney Jacques Verges claimed publicly that 
al-Joundi is seeking refugee status in France and cannot 
return to Syria, and on that basis is entitled to file suit 
in French courts on alleged crimes taking place outside 
France.  Olivier Barrat, the MFA\'s specialist on ICC matters, 
told us January 6 that he did not believe there would be any 
role for the ICC in al-Joundi\'s suit against the US military. 
 When asked about jurisdiction, he said it was quite rare for 
French courts to take up cases where neither the plaintiff 
nor the defendant had any ties to France.  Nonetheless, he 
did say there was a limited ability for French courts to 
address matters of \"universal competence,\" but that it was 
completely up to the courts to rule whether al-Joundi\'s suit 
could be accepted.  His implication was that the suit would 
be turned down but he was careful not to go on record. 
 
4.  (C) In preliminary comments to us on the al-Joundi 
lawsuit, other MFA officials stressed that al-Joundi is 
acting in a private capacity with the GoF having little 
recourse to limit his actions.  MFA DAS-equivalent for 
Iraq/Iran/Arabian Gulf issues Antoine Sivan conceded to us 
January 6 that he personally had contact with al-Joundi prior 
to the December 21 release of French ex-hostages Christian 
Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, and urged that al-Joundi 
remain quiet on his threatened lawsuit until the two French 
hostages were released.  Now with Malbrunot and Chesnot free, 
Sivan claimed, the GoF had no leverage to limit al-Joundi\'s 
actions.  MFA Iraq desk officer Renaud Salins (protect) 
described Sivan\'s earlier conversations with al-Joundi as a 
private GoF attempt to calm the situation and advise 
al-Joundi against making exaggerated claims.  Sivan claimed 
that he was unaware on what basis al-Joundi remained in 
France and that he would seek clarification and get back to 
us.  Sivan also concurred when we observed that al-Joundi\'s 
recent public accusations appeared to contradict his initial 
public remarks upon his arrival in Paris last November. 
5.  (C) Comment: Al-Joundi\'s background and reported lengthy 
exile in Iraq from Syria remain murky and suggest that he may 
be more than a simple chauffeur.  A local French-Iraqi 
anthropologist who is a frequent French media commentator on 
Iraq issues told us privately that the fact that al-Joundi 
had fled Syria and resided in Saddam-led Iraq for a lengthy 
period would suggest a linkage to the former Iraqi regime\'s 
security services.  The same commentator told us he was 
researching further details on al-Joundi\'s background which 
he would seek to publicize once he reached a credible 
conclusion.  Al-Joundi has avoided criticism of his hostage 
takers, the Islamic Army in Iraq, despite the fact that the 
group has been responsible for a number of decapitations of 
foreign hostages.  In a November 29 \"Liberation\" interview, 
al-Joundi stressed that he was not at all mistreated by his 
captors, and conceded that by the end of his detention he had 
developed a sense of fraternity with his captors to the 
extent that he offered to take up arms and join them.  In 
more recent press comments, al-Joundi defended his decision 
not to sue his captors by asserting that the Islamic Army in 
Iraq had \"the right to defend their country.\" 
 
6.  (C) Comment, continued: Al-Joundi\'s allegations of 
torture and abuse contradict initial statements he made after 
his arrival in France, most notably in the November 29 
\"Liberation\" interview.  In describing the initial reaction 
by U.S. soldiers who discovered him in an abandoned home in 
Fallujah, al-Joundi asserted, \"we were a bit mistreated but I 
was happy.  I would have readily given them one million 
dollars for having saved my life.\"  In the same interview, 
al-Joundi described a U.S. captain as congratulating him on 
his liberation after a U.S. soldier had interrogated him \"a 
bit harshly\" for one hour.  Al-Joundi added that U.S. 
officials had provided him with medical treatment, cigarettes 
and food -- hardly a description of war crimes.  End comment.

OPINION IS WELL AWARE OF THE POLITICAL PUBLICITY APPROACH THAT 
LIES BEHIND THE BIG SHOW IN JAKARTA. BUT THE RACE FOR PLEDGES 
IS BETTER THAN THE ARMS RACE. THE MOST POSITIVE ELEMENT OF THE 
SUMMIT WAS THE FACT THAT THE U.S. GAVE UP ON ITS IDEA TO ROB 
THE UN OF ITS NATURAL ROLE. BUT THE QUANTITY OF MONEY PLEDGED 
DOES NOT GUARANTEE EFFECTIVENESS. AID MUST BE USED 
INTELLIGENTLY, AVOIDING WASTE AND CORRUPTION, TWO FREQUENT 
ILLS FOUND WHEN DEALING WITH DISASTER AND IN THESE REGIONS. 
OTHERWISE THE APOCALYPSE OF THE TSUNAMI COULD BE FOLLOWED BY 
OTHER APOCALYPSES.\" 
 
\"CHINA\'S OTHER AWAKENING\" 
MICHEL SCHIFRES IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (01/07): \"THE 
RACE TO GIVE TO THE TSUNAMI SURVIVORS HAS ALSO LED MANY 
NATIONS TO CLARIFY THEIR POLITICAL CHOICES AND ORIENTATION. 
ONE EXAMPLE IS CHINA. FOR THE FIRST TIME, IN THE WAKE OF A 
WORLDWIDE TRAGEDY, CHINA HAS REACTED LIKE ANY OTHER WESTERN 
NATION AND ACTED LIKE ANY OTHER DEVELOPED NATION, THUS 
REVEALING ITS ASPIRATION TO BECOME PART OF THE CONCERT OF 
NATIONS. CHINA, LIKE INDIA, IS PROVING ITS REGIONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY IN THE FACE OF THE DISASTER, AND ITS DESIRE NOT 
TO LET THE WEST AND JAPAN HAVE A FREE HAND. BEYOND ITS SINCERE 
HUMANITARIAN CONCERN, CHINA\'S POLITICAL AMBITION IS OBVIOUS.\" 
MIDDLE EAST - PALESTINIAN ELECTIONS 
\"A TIME FOR HOPE\" 
BRUNO FRAPPAT IN CATHOLIC LA CROIX (01/07): \"IF MAHMUD ABBAS 
WINS THE ELECTION. HIS CHALLENGES WILL BE ENORMOUS, BECAUSE IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST NOTHING IS EVER SIMPLE. HE WILL NEED TO 
EXERCISE VERY STRONG AUTHORITY OVER THE PALESTINIANS TO STOP 
THOSE WHO MIGHT STILL BE TEMPTED BY THE USE OF TERROR. THE 
OTHER CHALLENGE IS A POLITICAL ONE AND HAS ITS ROOTS IN 
ISRAEL. ABBAS MUST PROVE TO THE SHARON-PERES GOVERNMENT THAT 
HE IS THE CREDIBLE PARTNER AND VIABLE INTERLOCUTOR THAT ISRAEL 
HAS BEEN CALLING FOR. WE ARE ON THE EVE OF SEEING ONE OF THOSE 
`WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY\' THAT HISTORY SO SELDOM OFFERS.\" 
 
TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS 
 
\"CHIRAC\'S SHEEP\'S EYES TOWARDS THE U.S.\" 
VERONIQUE SOULE IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (01/07): \"THE 
DAYS ARE LONG GONE WHEN CHIRAC SPOKE OF THE `ILLEGALITY\' OF 
THE WAR IN IRAQ. HE IS NOW SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF `THE VITALITY 
OF THE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP.\' TO UNDERSCORE THIS DESIRE 
FOR A RAPPROCHEMENT, CHIRAC WILL GO TO WASHINGTON TOWARDS THE 
END OF FEBRUARY. AFTER PRESIDENT BUSH TRAVELS TO EUROPE. THIS 
IS A GESTURE WHICH PARIS READS AS A SIGN OF WASHINGTON\'S MORE 
CONCILIATORY ATTITUDE TOWARDS EUROPE AND ITS DESIRE TO 
COLLABORATE FURTHER IN ORDER TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL CRISES. 
SINCE THE IRAQI DISASTER, THE AMERICANS HAVE TURNED TO THE UN 
FOR SUPPORT, SOMETHING THAT FRANCE HAS INTERPRETED AS THE 
BEGINNING OF A CONVERSION TO MULTILATERALISM. AND FRANCE HAS 
TONED DOWN ITS CRITICISM OF WASHINGTON. BUT DOMINIQUE MOISI OF 
IFRI BELIEVES THAT WHEN `PARIS TAKES A FEW STEPS FORWARD, 
WASHINGTON TAKES A FEW BACK.\' NOTHING PROVES THAT WASHINGTON, 
WHICH HAS HAD TO GIVE IN TO THE UN IN JAKARTA, IS REALLY READY 
TO CONVERT TO MULTILATERALISM, IN PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO 
THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT.\" 
 
\"BUSH\'S INTEREST IN BISMARCK\" 
DOMINIQUE MOISI OF IFRI IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LES ECHOS (01/07): 
\"RELIABLE SOURCES IN WASHINGTON INDICATE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH 
HAS RECENTLY READ, AND WITH MUCH INTEREST, JOHN GADDIS\'S BOOK 
`SURPRISE, SECURITY AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.\' SHOULD 
AMERICA\'S ALLIES BE CONCERNED OR REASSURED ABOUT THIS 
SURPRISING INTEREST FOR BISMARCK\'S DIPLOMACY? BISMARCK\'S 
CHANGE FROM REVOLUTIONARY DIPLOMAT TO CONSERVATIVE MAY SUGGEST 
AN EVOLUTION IN THE U.S. DURING BUSH\'S SECOND TERM IN OFFICE. 
THE U.S. COULD BECOME A `HYBRID:\' MORE RADICAL ON THE DOMESTIC 
FRONT. AND MORE MODERATE WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY. IN 
SPITE OF HIS LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR THE UN OR HIS NOTED 
LACK OF INTEREST FOR HIS ALLIES, PRESIDENT BUSH WILL NEED TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THE ALLIES MORE THAN HE DID DURING HIS FIRST TERM. 
IF CONDOLEEZZA RICE HAD TO REPEAT HER FAMOUS REMARKS, TODAY 
SHE WOULD PROBABLY SAY `LET\'S KEEP RUSSIA IN MIND, ACCEPT 
GERMANY AND IGNORE FRANCE.\' IN SPITE OF FRANCE\'S DIPLOMATIC 
EFFORTS, THE U.S. IS NOT YET READY TO COMPLETELY FORGET THE 
PAST AND LOOK ON PARIS AS A PARTNER WORTHY OF TRUST.\" LEACH

SUBJECT: France: Telecom and Information Technology Update 
 
NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION 
 
1. This is another in a series of periodic updates on the 
French telecommunications and information technology 
sectors, including internet and e-commerce.

2.  Phone rates in France may soon be going up: France 
Telecom is reportedly negotiating with the French government 
and with telecom regulator ART to increase subscription 
rates by 20 percent over the next three years according to 
reports in French newspapers La Tribune and Le Figaro, AFX 
News reported from Paris. The company is offering a five 
percent reduction in local calls rates to offset the 
increase, La Tribune said. 
 
3.  French Telecom Regulator Board Gets New Member:  French 
equivalents of FCC Commissioners are called ART college 
members and France got a new one when Dominique Roux\'s term 
expired recently.  On January 4, Edouard Bridoux was named 
by President Chirac to become the newest ART college member. 
Born in 1945, Bridoux has been a university full professor 
since 1975.  He began his career in 1972 as conference 
coordinator (\"maitre des conferences\") at the University of 
Valenciennes in northeastern France, where he became 
University President in 1978.  The following year, Bridoux 
rejoined the office of the Minister for higher education, 
where he became Chief of Staff for the Minister in 1980. 
From 1986 to 1990, Bridoux was rector of the Academy of 
Amiens, then Director of the National Superior School of 
Engineering and Mechanical Energy of Valenciennes from 1992 
to 1993, before becoming rector of the Academy of Reims from 
1993 to 1995.  Bridoux was technical advisor for higher 
education and research in the Prime Minister\'s office from 
1995 to 1997 and then Director General of the National 
Institute for Transportation Research and Security (INRETS) 
from 1997 to 2000.  Since 2000, Bridoux has served as 
technical advisor for higher education and research in the 
Prime Minister\'s office.  ART college members serve 
nonrenewable six-year terms.  Three of the five members are 
named by the President; the other two are named by the 
President of the National Assembly and the President of the 
Senate respectively. 
 
4.  Videophone service soon to be deployed in France:  IP 
and video technology firm Leadtek Research and telecom 
services provider France Telecom have unveiled what the two 
firms describe as the world\'s first large scale deployment 
of video telephony, \"MaLigne visio.\"  Jointly developed by 
the two companies, MaLigne visio is an IP-based videophone 
service that lets users see each other during phone 
conversations. The service utilizes QoS monitoring to 
achieve real-time video chat, video messaging, video 
streaming, and information on demand.  The service uses 
Leadtek 8882 videophones with integrated cameras and 
screens, which subscribers connect to a custom broadband 
modem and a standard telephone jack.  Calls begin without 
the video, which users activate or deactivate with the press 
of a button.  The videophones receive calls from any type of 
fixed or wireless phones for regular voice calls, just like 
a standard phone.  MaLigne visio provides customers with a 
free voice and video messaging service that allows users to 
retrieve voice and video messages from any other location. 
Users can also share and discuss photos and video by 
connecting a digital camera or camcorder to the videophone. 
According to recent press releases, at launch MaLigne visio 
will be available to about 75% of the French population. 
 
5.  Care to purchase a loss-making Franco-Italian ISP?: 
Tiscali recently said it had received several takeover 
offers for LibertySurf, its French internet service 
provider, but the Italian group denied planning to sell the 
company it acquired four years ago for 650 million Euros 
($864 million).  LibertySurf had 386,000 ADSL internet 
subscribers or 5.5% share of the French market in September. 
It is the fourth largest operator in the French broadband 
market, and generated nearly 200 million euros in 2003 
revenues.  Speculation about the potential sale underlines 
Tiscali\'s urgent need for cash.  Tiscali was forced to sell 
smaller subsidiaries in Europe and South Africa to raise 
money for the repayment of a 250 million Euro bond due in 
July 2005.  Industry reports have said that Paris investment 
bank Rothschild was hired by Tiscali to gauge interest among 
European rivals for its loss-making French subsidiary, 
valued by analysts at about 250 million Euros. A Tiscali 
spokeswoman said: \"For the last two months there have been 
rising rumors that the refinancing Tiscali must do would 
force it to sell one of its core operations. These rumors 
and the dynamic growth of the French market encouraged some 
operators to make expressions of interest for Tiscali 
France. But Tiscali intends to maintain its presence in 
France.\" 
 
6.  Someone close to the talks reportedly said that Neuf 
Telecom, the French internet and telecommunications group 
controlled by the Louis Dreyfus family, submitted a bid for 
LibertySurf last month.  Neuf Telecom has declined to 
comment, but, tellingly, documents about Tiscali\'s French 
subsidiary were reportedly sent to several of its biggest 
competitors, including Deutsche Telecom, which owns Club 
Internet in France, and Iliad, which owns Free, France\'s 
second-biggest ADSL provider.  Interestingly, the head of 
LibertySurf quit in August, a month before Tiscali announced 
the resignation of Renato Soru, its founder and chairman, 
who left to pursue a political career in his native 
Sardinia. Any sale of LibertySurf could be complicated by a 
30 million euro loan it extended to Tiscali in June 2003. 
The Italian parent group said it had repaid 18 million euros 
of the loan with rest to be repaid in the first quarter. 
 
7.  France Telecom signs agreement for its North American 
optical network:  The operating subsidiary of U.S.-firm 
Level 3 Communications Inc. has signed a multi-year 
agreement to provide transmission and co-location services 
to France Telecom.  Under the terms of the agreement, Level 
3 will become FT\'s primary provider of lit broadband 
transport and co-location services in North America.  Level 
3 will supply identified private-line and wavelength 
circuits across its 19,400-mile optical network in the U.S., 
which the FT Group will use as a platform to support its 
customers.  \"This agreement stands as proof of the strength 
of our longstanding customer relationship with France 
Telecom,\" said Level 3\'s president and chief operating 
officer, Kevin O\'Hara.  \"We\'re pleased that France Telecom 
will continue to rely on Level 3 as its principal network 
partner in North America, and we look forward to providing 
them with the highest quality communications services in the 
coming years.\"  The new agreement replaces and terminates an 
earlier, 20-year dark fiber contract signed by the two 
companies in October 2000.  Under the prior agreement, FT 
acquired a nationwide dark fiber network from Level 3, along 
with ongoing maintenance and co-location services.  The 
fiber strands leased to FT in the initial transaction will 
revert to Level 3.  The transaction is expected to be 
completed in the first quarter of 2005. 
 
8.  A Bit of Old News - France Telecom and SFR Cegetel fined 
for anti-competitive pricing:  In October 2004, France\'s 
competition authority fined France Telecom 18 million euros 
and its competitor SFR Cegetel 2 million euros, after 
concluding that both groups practiced anti-competitive 
pricing tactics toward business customers between 1999 and 
2001.  The regulator found that the two telecom operators 
took advantage of their combined mobile and fixed telephony 
businesses to offer below-cost pricing on calls within their 
own networks, while charging high prices for other fixed- 
line operators to call their mobile networks. Through the 
practice, SFR Cegetel sustained a 65% negative margin from 
fixed-mobile calls within its own network.  For its part, 
France Telecom sustained a negative margin of 70%, but 
realized a profit of 244 million euros from billing other 
fixed-line operators for calls to its mobile network, of 
which it returned 114 million euros to its business 
customers.  A fixed-line operator would have registered 
trading losses of 126 million euros over the same period if 
it had offered the same prices to customers, said the 
regulator.  France Telecom has responded that wholesale 
prices were fixed by regulator ART and that it plans to file 
an appeal against the fine.

SUBJECT: 2004: FRENCH MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  France enjoyed a moderately good year in 2004 
in terms of macroeconomic performance, advances in economic 
policy, and economic stability.  Job growth remains the 
economy\'s major weakness, but modest GDP growth did help the 
government to maintain fiscal restraint and the private 
sector to post respectable gains.  END SUMMARY 
 
------------------------- 
MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 
------------------------- 
 
2.  Although it will be a while before the GOF finalizes all 
official statistics, preliminary estimates indicate France 
enjoyed a relatively positive year in 2004.  Gross domestic 
product (GDP) totaled around 1.5 billion euros. The 
estimated real (inflation-adjusted) growth rate of 2.1 
percent would be the best performance since CY 2000, 
although such growth lags behind the U.S. figure of 3.9 
percent annual GDP growth.  Despite an environment prompting 
households to exercise caution, consumption is thought to 
have increased around 2.1 percent, slightly faster than 
purchasing power (which increased around 1.6 percent 
compared with 0.5 percent in 2003), primarily due to 
increased expenditures for manufactured goods.  Unemployment 
remained stable but high at around 9.9 percent.  Inflation 
edged up to around 2 percent.  In 2004, France registered a 
small trade deficit (2 billion euros in the first ten 
months).  Imports rose steadily, but exports increased only 
moderately, mainly due to the higher euro. 
 
3.  Central government spending was flat.  Public sector 
debt increased only slightly, but remained high at 64 
percent of GDP.  The public deficit was 3.6 percent of GDP 
(versus an EU target of 3 percent). 
 
4.  As for financial markets, at year-end 2004, Euronext 
(the conglomerate owning the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels 
stock exchanges) ranked fifth among world markets with a 
stock-market capitalization of USD 1.8 trillion, and in 
recent weeks has tabled an offer to buy the London stock 
exchange.  The CAC 40 index posted a 7.9 percent growth rate 
for the year, and finally regained and surpassed the market 
value it had lost in the 2000-2001 recession. At the end of 
December 2004, the total market capitalization of the 1,333 
companies listed on Euronext was up 9.1 percent over 2003. 
 
--------------- 
ECONOMIC POLICY 
--------------- 
 
5.  The key features of France\'s economic policy in 2004 
included the GOF\'s effort to restrain central government 
spending, and the cautious continuation of its \"partial 
privatization\" policy (not necessarily selling outright 
state-owned enterprises, but opening up firms to private 
investors, even to the extent of ceding majority shares). 
The Prime Minister heralded health care reform as a major 
achievement in 2004, although under the bill passed, the 
French health care system is not supposed to achieve 
financial balance until 2007.  Late in the year (subsequent 
to significant gains by left-leaning parties in local 
elections), the GOF trumpeted \"social cohesion\" as a major 
goal.  The term social cohesion is the French right-of- 
center equivalent to \"compassionate conservatism,\" involving 
projects aimed at breaking down ethnic ghettos, integrating 
immigrants, overcoming poverty, reintegrating troubled 
neighborhoods, and fighting against gender discrimination. 
The bill envisions spending 13 billion euros over five 
years.  Since the \"social cohesion\" bill passed late in the 
year, no major social projects were begun in 2004, and the 
GOF made no measurable progress in the bill\'s chief 
performance indicators, namely reducing unemployment and 
alleviating the lower-income housing shortage. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  2004 was a mixed year for the French economy.  Modest 
growth was an improvement over previous performance, but 
employment, the Euro/dollar relationship, domestic demand 
and the public deficit remain areas of concern.  Economic 
reform steps were modest, and France continues to advance 
its privatization agenda, if cautiously.  Government 
officials predict 2005 growth of 2.5 percent, although most 
economists foresee growth more on the order of two percent. 
The key area to watch is whether, as the 2007 presidential 
elections get closer, the GOF is prepared to tackle 
remaining economic reforms.

SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION REPORT - ELECTIONS IN PALESTINE 
IRAQ - VIOLENCE BEFORE ELECTIONS 
PARIS - MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 2005 
 
 
(A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY\'S REPORT: 
 
1. ELECTIONS IN PALESTINE 
2. IRAQ - VIOLENCE BEFORE ELECTIONS 
 
B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
TWO MAJOR STORIES DOMINATE TODAY\'S FRONT PAGES AND 
COMMENTARIES: THE PROJECTED VICTORY BY MAHMOUD ABBAS IN 
PALESTINE AND WHAT THIS MAY MEAN FOR THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
PROCESS, AND THE SITUATION IN IRAQ, WEEKS BEFORE THE 
ELECTIONS, WHICH ACCORDING TO CATHOLIC LA CROIX, COULD BE 
COMPROMISED BY VIOLENCE. 
 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTIONS IS WIDELY 
CONSIDERED AS A \"SIGNAL OF HOPE\" (LIBERATION AND LE PARISIEN) 
AND A \"VOTE FOR PEACE\" (LE FIGARO). COMMENTATORS AGREE THAT 
\"THE ELECTION IN PALESTINE, ALONG WITH PRESIDENT BUSH\'S RE- 
ELECTION AND THE NEW SHARON-PEREZ GOVERNMENT GIVE A NEW 
PERSPECTIVE TO PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.\" (SEE PART C) 
 
FM BARNIER IS INTERVIEWED IN POPULAR RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE 
PARISIEN (AND ALSO IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE THE INTERNATIONAL 
HERALD TRIBUNE): \"THIS IS A VICTORY FOR DEMOCRACY, AND A FIRST 
VICTORY FOR PEACE. IN ISRAEL, SHARON IS AT A HISTORIC 
CROSSROADS, AND I BELIEVE HE WILL BE UP TO THE TASK. WE ARE IN 
A NEW CONTEXT, WITH A LEGITIMATE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, A MUCH 
MORE OPEN ISRAELI GOVERNMENT WHICH IS COMMITTED TO WITHDRAWING 
FROM GAZA, A U.S. PRESIDENT NEWLY ELECTED AND EUROPEANS WHO 
STAND UNITED AND ARE AVAILABLE. WE WANT A NEW TRANSATLANTIC 
PARTNERSHIP: THE TEST WILL LIE IN OUR COLLECTIVE ABILITY TO 
GET THE PEACE PROCESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST BACK ON TRACK.\" 
 
RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO CARRIES AN OP-ED BY ISRAELI 
AMBASSADOR NISSIM ZVILI ON THE \"DIFFICULT RELATIONS BETWEEN 
FRANCE AND ISRAEL. AT LEAST WE HAVE EACH ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
THERE IS A DEEP BREAK BETWEEN THE TWO SOCIETIES. UNFORTUNATELY 
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A DEAF-MUTE DIALOGUE. WE LISTEN TO EACH 
OTHER POLITELY, BUT EACH STICKS TO HIS GUNS.  AFTER THE 
EUPHORIA OF THE OSLO ACCORDS, WE ARE MODERATE IN OUR 
ENTHUSIASM, IN ORDER TO GIVE THE NEGOTIATIONS THEIR BEST 
CHANCE FOR SUCCESS.\" 
 
THE SECOND MAJOR STORY, IRAQ AND THE GROWING DAILY VIOLENCE, 
LEADS MANY COMMENTATORS TO DOUBT WHETHER THE ELECTIONS WILL BE 
ABLE TO BE CONDUCTED FAIRLY. CATHOLIC LA CROIX HEADLINES 
\"IRAQI ELECTIONS UNDERMINED BY VIOLENCE\" AND INTERVIEWS PIERRE- 
JEAN LUIZARD, A RESEARCHER AT THE CNRS (THE NATIONAL CENTER 
FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH) WHO SAYS: \"NO ARMY WILL BE ABLE TO 
LESSEN THE INSECURITY. IRAQ HAS BECOME A BATTLEGROUND FOR A 
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND A FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT, WHICH 
SEEMS TO HAVE A HOLD ON IRAQ\'S SUNNI COMMUNITY AND COULD 
SPREAD. THE ATTACKS IN IRAQ HAVE WORSENED IN THE PAST THREE 
MONTHS AND KILLED A NUMBER OF FIGURES WHO MIGHT HAVE PLAYED A 
ROLE IN MANAGING THE COUNTRY. I REMAIN PESSIMISTIC ABOUT 
IRAQ.\" 
 
LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION CARRIES AN OP-ED BY FRANCOIS GERE OF 
THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC ANALYSIS ON THE SUICIDE 
ATTACKS WHICH HAVE BEEN PLAGUING BAGHDAD. (SEE PART C) 
COMMENTATORS, WRITING ON THE DISAPPEARANCE OF LIBERATION\'S 
JOURNALIST, NOTE BAGHDAD\'S GROWING INSECURITY PRIOR TO THE 
ELECTIONS. 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
ELECTIONS IN PALESTINE 
 
\"A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEACE PROCESS\" 
LUC DE BAROCHEZ IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (01/10): \"THE 
MIDDLE EAST HAS ENTERED INTO AN ERA OF HOPE. PRESIDENT BUSH, 
WHO DOES NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RE-ELECTION, HAS A FREE HAND 
TO GET MORE INVOLVED IN THE MIDDLE EAST. FRENCH FM BARNIER HAS 
INDICATED THAT `THE NEW RELATIONSHIP\' BETWEEN THE AMERICANS 
AND THE EUROPEANS, AS ILLUSTRATED BY CHIRAC\'S VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND BUSH\'S VISIT TO BRUSSELS ON 
FEBRUARY 22, COULD SERVE AS A `LEVER\' TO GET THE PEACE PROCESS 
BACK ON TRACK. BUT THE ELECTION OF ABBAS MUST NOT RAISE 
INCONSIDERATE HOPES: HE IS AFTER ALL ARAFAT\'S HEIR AND NOT 
VERY POPULAR IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. IF THE AMERICANS AND 
THE EUROPEANS DO NOT COMMIT THEMSELVES FURTHER, THE 
DISAPPOINTMENT WILL BE ON PAR WITH THE HOPES BORN OF THE 
ELECTION.\" 
 
\"A WINDOW\" 
GERARD DUPUY IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (01/10): \"WESTERN 
NATIONS MUST HEAR THE MESSAGE SENT BY THE PALESTINIANS AND 
ACCEPT THEIR SKEPTICISM, EXPRESSED TO THEM AS WELL AS TO 
MAHMOUD ABBAS. HE WAS ELECTED WITHOUT ANY REAL OPPOSITION, BUT 
WITH THE FIRM DEMAND THAT HE GET RESULTS. THIS MEANS THAT IF 
HE IS SLOW TO ACHIEVE THEM, HE WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. THE 
OFFER FOR A CONFERENCE ON THE MIDDLE EAST IN LONDON PROVES 
THAT TONY BLAIR IS AWARE OF THE URGENCY OF GRASPING THE 
OPPORTUNITY AT HAND, EVEN IF THE CONFERENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER. 
AN UNEXPECTED WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY HAS OPENED IN THE MIDDLE 
EASTERN IMPASSE. THE COUNTDOWN IS ALREADY ON, BEFORE THAT 
WINDOW CLOSES OVER THE COMPROMISE WHICH ABBAS HAS LINKED TO 
HIS ELECTION.\" 
 
\"PEACE IS AGAIN POSSIBLE\" 
PIERRE ROUSSELIN IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (01/10): \"NOW 
THAT PALESTINE HAS ELECTED A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT ARAFAT, 
PEACE WITH ISRAEL IS ONCE AGAIN POSSIBLE. AT THIS STAGE WE ARE 
SPEAKING OF A FRAGILE HOPE, BUT A HOPE NEVERTHELESS. IT IS 
FOUNDED ON THE FACT THAT ISRAEL AND THE U.S. ARE READY TO DEAL 
WITH ABBAS. WHOSE TASK IS IMMENSE: NAMELY HE MUST SUCCEED 
WHERE ARAFAT FAILED. THE ELECTION OF ABBAS WILL HAVE BEEN THE 
EASIEST PART. NOW THAT HE HAS BEEN ELECTED, ABBAS\'S FATE IS 
VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SHARON: HE CAN MAKE HIS WORK EASIER, 
OR ON THE CONTRARY MORE DIFFICULT. IN THE MEANTIME, THE U.S. 
AND EUROPE MUST GRASP THIS UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY. WE MUST 
SALUTE THIS SHOW OF PALESTINIAN DEMOCRACY AND HELP THE NEWLY- 
ELECTED PRESIDENT. AS WELL AS CONVINCE SHARON NOT TO OPPOSE 
HIM.\" 
 
\"SHARON\'S ATTITUDE WILL BE DECISIVE\" 
THOMAS DE ROCHECHOUART IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER FRANCE SOIR (01/10): 
\"HIS LACK OF A RIVAL HAS GIVEN ABBAS A CERTAIN MARGIN OF 
MANEUVER TO VOICE UNPOPULAR IDEAS SUCH AS ENDING THE ARMED 
INTIFADA. HIS SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON ISRAEL\'S DESIRE TO 
COLLABORATE WITH HIM. CAUGHT BETWEEN SHARON AND THE ARMED 
REBELLION, ABBAS WILL BE PLAYING A DIFFICULT GAME. HE WILL 
NEED TO BE CONVINCING, OR HIS POSITION AS A MODERATE WILL SOON 
BECOME IMPOSSIBLE.\" 
 
IRAQ - VIOLENCE BEFORE ELECTIONS 
 
\"IRAQ AND THE POLICY OF SUICIDE ATTACKS\" 
FRANCOIS GERE IN LEFT OF CENTER LIBERATION (01/10): \"SINCE 
ALLAWI\'S ELECTION, AN INSURRECTION IS RAVAGING TWO THIRDS OF 
IRAQ. THOSE IN POWER ARE MINIMIZING THE ATTACKS. IN THE PAST 
FEW MONTHS, IRAQ HAS BECOME THE THEATRE OF A VERY WORRISOME 
FORM OF ATTACK: SUICIDE-BOMBINGS. THE AIM OF THE ATTACKS 
AGAINST THE AMERICANS IS THREEFOLD: TO EMBARRASS THEM 
POLITICALLY, TO HIT THEM WHERE THEIR BIG WAR MACHINE IS MOST 
VULNERABLE AND TO ERODE THEIR MORAL. WHO ARE THE ATTACKERS? 
NOT A BUNCH OF DISPIRITED INDIVIDUALS, AS THE AUTHORITIES SAY. 
THE ATTACKERS COME FROM THREE SEPARATE GROUPS, THE SUNNI ANSAR 
AL-ISLAM, . A RADICAL GROUP OF FORMER SADDAM HUSSEIN 
SUPPORTERS AND A VAST GROUP COMPRISED OF FOREIGNERS. THEY HAVE 
A COMMON OBJECTIVE: THE AMERICANS, WHICH MAY NOT BE THE ONLY 
ONE. BUT THESE THREE GROUPS, FORTUNATELY, LACK COORDINATION. 
HEREIN LIES THEIR WEAKNESS. IRAQ IS LIKE A `FAILED STATE\' 
WHERE DIFFERENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE FACTIONS ARE AT WAR. THE 
MORE INTELLIGENT ONES ARE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THE AMERICAN 
MILITARY FORCES, WHO ARE LIKE SO MANY ELEPHANTS IN A CHINA 
SHOP. THESE GROUPS, IRAQ\'S NEW POLITICAL FORCE, ARE NOW ABLE 
TO TRAIN HUNDREDS OF VOLUNTEERS FOR SUICIDE ATTACKS WHICH 
REPRESENT A MAJOR DANGER FOR THE FUTURE. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO 
DISSEMINATE IN THE ARAB PENINSULA, AND CAUSE MORE 
DESTABILIZATION. NOTHING PROVES THAT THE DANGER WILL REMAIN 
CONFINED TO THAT REGION. IF WE IN EUROPE TEND TO NEGLECT THE 
EXISTENCE OF THESE SUICIDE ATTACKERS, THEY ON THE OTHER HAND 
HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN WE EXIST.\" LEACH

------- 
ANGOLA 
------- 
5. (SBU) The Secretariat said that it had not yet been 
able to talk with the Angolan Minister of Finance (as 
agreed upon at the November session), and will try again 
in January.  The IMF reported that after the staff visit 
to Angola in November, although some progress had been 
made, data issues remain.  The GoA is unable or unwilling 
to share information about its offshore oil accounts. 
These are not reported as part of their reserves, but the 
IMF suspects the total roughly equals existing reserves. 
If the GoA shares the information, then the IMF would 
visit in January 2005, which could lead to Article IV 
discussions at the Board in February.  The GoA also held 
bilateral discussions with Hungary and Bulgaria, which 
appear to have involved debt-rescheduling negotiations, 
not merely data reconciliation.  The World Bank reported 
on a memorandum of understanding with the UNDP, and 
commented that a precondition for a donors\' conference 
would be the signing (not implementation) of a Staff 
Monitored Program (SMP) with the IMF, and finalization of 
a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP).  The objective 
of such a conference would not be to collect pledges, but 
to get Angola to get used to multi-year programming.  The 
GoA needs to have a longer-term vision.  The Bank will 
continue for the next 18 months an interim support 
strategy.  Last week it concluded in Paris negotiation 
about a loan of USD 200 million, with a board date for 
approval of Feb 11. 
 
6.  (SBU) The Spanish delegate thanked the IMF for its 
update, and offered to help the Secretariat contact 
Angolan officials. 
 
7. (SBU) The Chair noted the continuing desire to engage 
the Angolans, welcomed the Spanish offer of assistance, 
and promised to report results at the next meeting. 
 
---------- 
ARGENTINA 
---------- 
8. (SBU) The Chair reported on his informal visit to the 
Argentine authorities (in his capacity as Ambassador, not 
as Paris Club President), in which the Argentineans urged 
creditors to be more flexible and creative.  The IMF 
confirmed, however, that the GoA does not want another 
IMF program; it just wants to repay the IMF as soon as 
possible and be done with it.  This creates the tactical 
problem that the GoA may seek to approach the Paris Club 
without an IMF program.  It is up to the creditor 
countries to decide how to handle that possible scenario, 
but working in tandem has generally been the best 
approach in the past.  As for the private sector, the 
debt exchange has been pushed forward from last month to 
February 25, 2005.  The GoA expects a high rate of 
participation.  Structural reforms are stalled. 
 
9. (SBU) The World Bank rep said the Board approved a 
loan on December 7 of USD 200 million for provincial 
services to reactivate the economy.  The Board did so 
only with great reluctance, because of its concerns about 
debt levels and structural reforms.  The rest of the Bank 
programs are on hold.  The rate of net lending flows in 
2005 probably will be just under a half billion USD to 
Argentina; with an IMF program the net flow would be 
slightly positive to the Bank. 
 
10. (SBU) The UK rep argued that although conditionality 
is important, an IMF program is just a means to an end 
and perhaps the Paris Club should consider other means, 
citing Nigeria as an example.  In the case of Argentina, 
however, no conditionality would exist absent an IMF 
program; therefore, UK opposed any restructuring outside 
of a Fund program.  Germany answered that in the absence 
of progress on the IMF program, the Paris Club should 
send a strong letter requesting repayment, complaining 
that GOA\'s two years of increasing arrears amounted to an 
\'indirect rescheduling\' of its Paris Club debt.  The 
USDEL agreed to send a letter.  Italy agreed to send a 
letter, but arguing that the time is not right, suggested 
that perhaps January would be better.  Japan said it 
would join any consensus.  The Netherlands noted that it 
had been pushing for a letter since August, and fully 
supports sending one because it doubts that the private 
sector deal will ever materialize. 
 
11.  (SBU)  The Chair proposed that the Secretariat would 
circulate a draft letter, reminding the GoA about its 
repayment obligations and that if it wants a debt deal it 
needs an IMF program.  The Chair plans to send the letter 
in January. 
 
----- 
CHINA 
----- 
12. (SBU)  Spain asked for China\'s inclusion on the 
agenda, in order for the Club to consider the issue of 
China\'s relationship with the Paris Club and a possible 
future membership.  Countries agreed that a first step 
would be for the Secretariat to gather publicly available 
individual country data on China\'s role as a creditor. 
Japan raised the issue of China\'s Export Bank\'s loans to 
Angola as an example.  Germany pointed out that China is 
a WTO but not OECD member, the opposite of Russia, and 
said China is a major case and its membership in the Club 
will definitely be a political matter for the Club.  The 
Germany rep said that China had approached the Club very 
informally in 1999 on its principles and procedures.  The 
Chinese had in the last few days approached Germany via 
their Embassy to ask about Germany\'s opinion of a Chinese 
membership in the Club (UK and Russia later indicated 
they also had been asked the same question fairly 
recently).  He asked the IMF for information on China\'s 
claims, because to be a Paris Club member a country must 
have \"substantial\" claims.  The UK noted that China is a 
very active creditor in Africa and Latin America.  The 
USDEL suggested-and the Chair agreed--that China might be 
invited to the Paris Club informational meeting (see 
\"Iraq\" below) discussion to be set up for non-Paris Club 
creditors of Iraq. 
 
13. (SBU) The IMF said that the Chinese had not raised 
Paris Club membership during the Fund\'s most recent 
mission (which left December 7).  The Chinese are a very 
active creditor, having forgiven $1.3 billion of all debt 
to 31 African HIPC and low-income countries.  He said the 
IMF could include a questionnaire on China\'s creditor 
information during its Article IV consultations in April 
2005, and pointed out a number of public sources the 
Secretariat could use in gathering data on China\'s 
 
SIPDIS 
creditor role.  The World Bank also offered to help the 
Secretariat gather data on developing country claims. 
 
SIPDIS 
The Bank pointed out that notwithstanding its growing 
creditor role, China remains the Bank\'s largest borrower 
at $21 billion (half in IBRD exposure, although the IBRD 
share is declining over time due to early repayments in 
2002, 2003, and 2004).  China is still an active 
borrower, at about $1.2 billion a year. 
 
14.  (SBU) The Chair said it would report to members the 
results of its informal findings on China\'s creditor 
role, so that members could then consider next steps. 
 
------------------- 
CONGO (BRAZZAVILLE) 
------------------- 
15.  (SBU) The IMF said the Board approved on December 6 
a three-year PRGF for USD 84 million that is in line with 
the priorities (decrease poverty, increase oil 
transparency) identified in the GoC\'s PRSP.  2002 arrears 
totaled CFA 258 billion to the Paris Club, while the PRGF 
assumes a payment of CFA 106 billion in the first year. 
The IMF research department just revised downward 
projected oil prices, which brings the IMF assumptions 
very close to where they were in August with WEO 
projections.  The World Bank noted that the Board 
approved a USD 30 million economic recovery credit last 
week; generally the Bank is pleased with the GoC progress 
in repaying arrears. 
 
16.  (SBU) The Secretariat distributed the Congolese debt 
reduction proposal, and commented on two technical 
details - additional conditions for rescheduling post- 
ccod debt treated in the 1996 agreed minute, and a 5-year 
reprofiling of post-ccod debt.  Russia said it is not 
comfortable with the request for a 5-year reprofiling. 
Denmark requested the agreed minute include a de minimus 
clause, which Japan supported.  The French suggested a 
clawback clause.  The UK expressed uncertainty about a 
clawback.  Germany supported the Russian position, and 
suggested payment be made in one year.  The USDEL 
questioned whether a clawback clause would be worth the 
effort, since most debtors refuse them and since they are 
complex, but noted flexibility within the range between 1 
to 5 years for a reprofiling. 
 
17.  (SBU) The Chair confirmed the Paris Club would open 
the negotiation with the GoC on December 15. 
 
-------- 
DJIBOUTI 
-------- 
18. (SBU)  The Chair reminded creditors that only the 
first phase of Djibouti\'s most recent Agreed Minute was 
ever implemented (from October 1999 to end-August 2000). 
The IMF said that Djibouti\'s performance under its SMP 
started in April 2004 was `quite weak,\' with only limited 
progress on structural reforms.  The authorities had 
hoped the SMP would lay the basis for a PRGF, but agreed 
to ask for an extension of the SMP in order to create a 
longer track record (a minimum of two quarters of 
successful implementation) for the PRGF.  During the IMF 
November mission, the Minister of Finance had lectured 
the Fund on raising the issue of Djibouti\'s arrears with 
certain Paris Club creditors.  The IMF should not be 
involved; instead, creditors should be discussing their 
disputes regarding arrears directly with the government. 
Furthermore, the Minister said, those countries (Italy, 
Spain) were continuing to give grants to Djibouti, 
implying that they would not be doing so if they had a 
`real\' problem with the Government.  Italy and Spain 
countered that the Government had refused to deal with it 
in good faith, and in Italy\'s case, the issue was not a 
dispute over the debt but rather a dispute over the debt 
treatment given by the Paris Club: the Minister had told 
them it was \"unfair\" that Djibouti was not a HIPC 
country.  The World Bank representative said progress on 
its overall Country Assistance Strategy was satisfactory, 
with its portfolio strengthened and improved; a new CAS 
will come before the Bank board in January 2005. 
 
19. (SBU) The Chair indicated that he would send a firm 
letter to the Government reaffirming Paris Club 
solidarity. 
 
------------------ 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
------------------ 
20. (SBU)  The Technical Secretary of the Finance 
Ministry of the GODR met with the Secretariat the week 
before the December session to explain the DR\'s 
comparability of treatment (CoT) strategy, showing them a 
copy of a letter sent only to DR creditors (Club members 
did not see a copy of the letter).  The latest CoT 
attempt relies on a bond swap, the results of which will 
be known in the coming months.  This means the DR will 
miss the end-December 2004 deadline set in the April 2004 
AM.  The DR asked the Secretariat for more time; while 
the 2004 AM has a suspension clause, members did not 
believe it was a good idea to exercise it after the 
Secretariat posed the question. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
21. (SBU) The new two-year IMF SBA program for 2005/06 is 
being presented this week, the IMF rep indicated.  The 
Fund said that it would ask members for financing 
assurances at the January session instead of at the 
December session.  Italy said it has post-ccod arrears on 
ODA debt of $2.3 million; it also expressed concern about 
the CoT situation.  The USDEL approved of the performance 
tripwires established in the upcoming SBA, and on the 
question of post-ccod arrears, acknowledged it was a 
serious problem but did not support annulling the 2004 
AM, instead suggesting that the Club offer financing 
assurances for just one year.  This would meet the 
members\' concerns over CoT, permit the IMF program to go 
forward, and motivate the DR to work towards CoT. 
Germany and Spain supported the US idea on one-year 
assurances, and the IMF confirmed that the two-year 
program could go forward with assurances for just the 
first year (the DR would need to return to the Club for 
negotiations before the second year).  Germany added that 
the DR should clear post-ccod and interest arrears before 
the next round of negotiations and that creditors should 
continue to ask for a new DSA.  The IMF said the DR could 
return to the Club in March, and by that time the results 
of the bond offer should be clear. 
 
22. (SBU) The Chair closed the DR session by saying it 
would circulate before Christmas a draft letter, which 
would insist on CoT compliance and remind the DR of 
outstanding arrears.  He said the Club could do one year 
financing assurances, and between January and March 
members could consider any pre-conditions for 
negotiations. 
 
----- 
HAITI 
----- 
23. (SBU) The IMF is seeking management approval for an 
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) arrangement. 
There could be a meeting in January after which things 
would move quickly.  SMP performance is satisfactory, but 
some structural commitments are delayed.  The stock of 
arrears to bilateral creditors is USD 28.5 million to 
France, Italy and Spain, with the bulk of it owed to 
France.  In designing the EPCA facility, the IMF had 
assumed that Haiti would remain current on payments to 
those countries that are providing substantial financial 
support over the EPCA period, e.g., the USG and Canada, 
which are together providing USD 250 million, far in 
excess of the USD 2 million of scheduled debt service to 
those two donors.  The IMF is asking creditors if they 
are willing to go along with a debt service payment 
moratorium, or provide aid to cover payments due, as a 
positive signal to Haiti until the time that a new 
program is available.  The World Bank reported on a USD 
12 million budget recovery credit, and a USD 73 million 
package to be presented to the Board on January 6.  The 
Bank strategy is to provide IDA intervention in the short 
term to restore institutional credibility.  The USD 73 
million is about half the IDA financing pledged by the 
Bank, but is contingent on Haiti clearing USD 52 million 
in IDA arrears. 
 
24. (SBU) Italy inquired about the French position, and 
although it does not have the resources of the US/Canada, 
it wants to help and so in principle can agree to a 
payment moratorium.  Spain pointed out that the Paris 
Club normally keeps a clear separation between financing 
aid and debt servicing.  New money is no alternative to 
debt treatment.  It expressed surprise about being asked 
for aid today, but will get an answer within a week. 
 
-------- 
HONDURAS 
-------- 
25. (SBU)  The Secretariat put Honduras on the December 
agenda, to see whether after the IMF report the Club 
would wish to invite Honduras for Completion Point (CP) 
in spring 2005.  The IMF rep said Honduras was broadly on 
track with its PRGF according to a review done in 
November, and was doing a good job in meeting its HIPC 
trigger conditions.  A team was in Honduras working on a 
DSA for HIPC completion point; a Board meeting is planned 
for March 2005, with a possible CP for end-March 2005. 
He envisaged no need for topping up.  The World Bank 
concurred with the IMF, and said its Board has scheduled 
to discuss Honduras\' HIPC CP during the second half of 
March 2005.  The Secretariat said given the March CP, it 
would sometime early next year start collecting the data 
call. 
 
---- 
IRAQ 
---- 
26. (SBU) The Chair stated that two issues remain from 
the last negotiation: the calculation of how to achieve 
the 60 percent reduction in the second tranche, and 
comparability of treatment.  The IIG has begun talks with 
non-Paris Club creditors, but there appears to be a need 
for an educational campaign.  In that vein, the Chair has 
received a letter from the Kuwait Fund asking for details 
of the debt deal.  The Chair asked for reaction to the 
idea of the Secretariat organizing an informational 
meeting in Paris. 
 
27. (SBU)  The IMF reported that a mission had just left 
Amman on Saturday after meeting with IIG officials to 
assess the 2005 Iraq budget.  Policy discussions will be 
held December 18.  Information is still only slowly 
trickling in, so the IMF is unable to judge EPCA 
performance.  The 2005 budget appears to be in line with 
the EPCA, but questions have arisen about the concrete 
measures on domestic petrol subsidies and domestic debt 
management.  The IMF understands that the IIG has begun 
contacting non-Paris Club creditors among the Gulf States 
and some eastern European countries.  The World Bank rep 
said donor funds of 225 million for 2004 have almost 
completely been allocated. 
 
28. (SBU) Russia asked a technical question about the 
calculation of the appropriate market rate after 23 
years, contained in the Secretariat working paper.  The 
USDEL noted that the USG has the same question as Russia 
and, while noting the 1994 working paper that serves as a 
precedent, questioned whether this was a sound 
methodology.  On comparability of treatment, the USDEL 
welcomed the willingness of the Secretariat to engage in 
a pedagogical exercise.  The USDEL mentioned that it 
plans to meet with the IIG in December, and hopefully 
sign its bilateral agreement (note: the bilateral debt 
treatment was signed December 17 in Washington).  The 
Netherlands requested that the working paper use a 
December 31, 2004 date for budgetary purposes, as it has 
already budgeted for debt relief this year.  The 
Secretariat, noting that it had not yet widely 
 
SIPDIS 
distributed the 1994 working paper addressing the 
appropriate market rate, defended the methodology, to 
which the Russian del proffered his support and said he 
would not be able to accept any changes to the working 
paper.  The USDEL noted its need to consult in DC. 
29. (SBU) The Chair said it would provide information to 
the Kuwait Fund as requested, and would proceed to 
organize its informational meeting. 
 
----- 
KENYA 
----- 
30.  The Secretariat indicated a successful IMF Board 
review would allow for implementation of the second phase 
(Jan 2005-Dec 31, 2005) of the latest agreement.  The IMF 
representative said the first review is scheduled for 
December 20; the staff report will recommend an 
augmentation of the PRGF by 50 million SDR, due in part 
to increased food imports.  The Kenyans were broadly on 
track with their program.  The World Bank said the 
government was making only slow progress on reforms, with 
financial sector reforms `relatively\' slow. 
Privatization was also progressing slowly, although the 
government is working on a paper setting out its 
privatization policies.  The Chairman said the government 
was on the right track on governance.  The USDEL asked 
about the relative importance of the five waivers being 
requested for the upcoming first review; the IMF said 
they were not particularly significant, characterizing 
them as `technical and small.\'  More importantly, 
authorities were taking offsetting actions.  The IMF 
wanted more, but said Kenya has continued to be affected 
by contentious deliberations on constitutional reform. 
Members approved sending a letter to the GOK on the 
entering into force of the second phase. 
 
--------- 
KYRGYZ REPUBLIC 
--------- 
31. (SBU) The Chair said he had received a letter from 
the GOK requesting an extension , to align the Paris 
Club\'s Houston terms treatment ending December 2004 with 
the end of the IMF program in April 2005.  The Chair 
indicated he proposed to answer positively, unless he 
heard otherwise from creditors.  The IMF rep told 
creditors that a staff mission is currently in Bishkek, 
where the team is evaluating a PRSP.  The IMF did provide 
an extension on November 19 to enable completion of the 
last review.  April was a target extension date with a 
built-in cushion, staff could go to the Board in 
February.  In the absence of a February Paris Club 
session, the IMF might seek financing assurances in 
January.  It would appreciate feedback on a new DSA; in 
its view flow treatments would not suffice, the GoK 
needing a stock treatment to stabilize debt ratios.  The 
World Bank rep discussed its leadership role in 
governance and the energy sector.  The Bank is happy with 
the progress on restructuring the energy sector, but not 
satisfied with the slow pace of government reform.  The 
Board is likely to approve three new projects totaling 
USD 38.5 million, of which 45 percent are grants. 
 
32. (SBU) Russia said it would need to consult in Moscow 
regarding the extension request.  In any event, no 
substantial payments are due over the next few months, so 
an extension really might not be necessary.  On the DSA, 
Russia said concessional treatment should be tailored to 
debtor needs; Naples terms may be too generous.  Japan 
expressed no problem joining a consensus, and noted that 
the 2002 agreed minute includes a goodwill clause on the 
stock of previously rescheduled debt, so a concession 
could be based on that clause.  Denmark is OK with an 
extension, and of course could follow the goodwill 
clause.  Germany agreed with Denmark, and inquired when 
will the new DSA be available.  The IMF acknowledged the 
need for a new DSA, but commented that it will not change 
much from the last one. 
 
33. (SBU) The Chair urged Russia to provide a reply 
quickly, to which Russia suggested that the Secretariat 
prepare a working paper.  (Note: USG holds no Krygyz 
debt.) 
 
-------- 
NIGERIA 
34. (SBU) According to the IMF, staff completed a visit 
on November 15 to look at the 2005 budget framework, 
which overlapped with a World Bank visit.  Article IV 
consultations are scheduled for late February, and the 
IMF would do a new DSA for a Board meeting in April or 
May.  The World Bank rep said Nigeria is on track with 
its legislative reforms; the Bank is thinking of 
increasing aid to USD 700 million. 
 
35. (SBU) The Secretariat expects Nigeria will have an 
increased capacity to pay its debt in 2005.  IMF states 
that the DSA shows reserves for Nigeria climbing to USD 
22 billion by the end of the DSA period; this assumes 
Paris Club is paid $1 billion in 2005.  Nigeria has seen 
a steady decrease in its debt to GDP ratio, and IMF 
states that the debt is sustainable.  The Secretariat can 
approach the GoN on an informal basis to urge them to 
regularize the situation and become current.  On the 2005 
payment allocation, Denmark\'s proposal is one option but 
the Secretariat would not like to reopen the debate. 
 
36. (SBU) Concerning lifting of the debt swap moratorium 
and sharing of 2005 payments: there seemed to be general 
consensus with lifting of the moratorium once all 2004 
payments have been received, although some creditors 
wanted to press for higher payments in 2005, perhaps 
requiring that Nigeria not run any new arrears.  On the 
allocation methodology for 2005, there was disagreement, 
with some supporting staying with the 2004 methodology 
and some supporting the German/Danish proposal. 
 
37.  (SBU) Creditors (except for Spain, and Brazil which 
still has not settled its dispute with Nigeria) confirmed 
receipt of the final 2004 payment.  Russia said it had 
studied the Danish proposal, and while it is flexible it 
prefers to leave the allocation as is.  On the question 
of contact, Russia supports sending a letter that ties 
lifting the moratorium on debt swaps to increased 2005 
payments.  Germany agreed with the letter, and mentioned 
that in a bilateral meeting with the Finance Minister in 
January, it would press for increased payment.  Germany 
distributed its own table with proposed 2005 allocations, 
and suggested that the issue should only be discussed 
within the Paris Club, not with Nigeria.  Denmark agreed 
on a letter with a link to increased payments, and 
reported that a Nigerian delegation recently had asked 
about lifting the ban on new export credits.  Denmark 
said no, not with arrears and no IMF program.  As for the 
2005 allocation, its proposal is still on the table. 
Spain objected to the draft letter, but said as soon as 
it gets its payment it could support lifting the debt 
swap ban.  Brazil noted its dispute has not yet been 
settled with Nigeria about the size of its debt, and so 
it has not gotten paid.  Belgium indicated a preference 
to link the moratorium end to increased payments.  It 
prefers to continue the 2004 allocation, but suggested 
that a better solution would be for Nigeria to increase 
its payments to amounts scheduled so it runs no arrears. 
The UK agreed to lift the moratorium (once Spain is paid) 
and while admitting that leveling up is important, 
prefers not to reopen the issue.  The Netherlands signed 
an ODA agreement on December 13 with the Nigerian FinMin. 
Responding to the Dutch request for increased payments, 
the Nigerian Finance Minister had said it is a political 
decision and a tough sell (which the Dutch interpret as 
not entirely excluding the possibility).  The Finance 
Minister had asked about a new agreement and the Dutch 
replied that Nigeria still would need a new DSA.  If 
Nigeria increases payments, the Netherlands can lift the 
debt swaps embargo.  They really should clear all 
arrears, if not in one year then at least all maturities 
next year.  On the allocation, the Netherlands cannot 
accept the 2004 schedule, but can accept the Danish 
proposal (and maybe the German table after taking a 
look).  Japan agreed 2005 payments should be higher.  A 
link to the moratorium is not necessary, but could be 
acceptable, but in any event the draft letter is 
acceptable.  Italy agreed to the letter, and is 
sympathetic to the Danish/German proposal.  Switzerland 
agreed with the draft letter, although it prefers greater 
specificity regarding the amount of increase payments, 
and strengthening the link.  The USDEL agreed to greater 
specificity, and agreed that if Nigeria were to meet all 
its maturities in 2005, the Paris Club could avoid the 
allocation problem.  Finland supports the letter. 
 
38. (SBU)  The Chair took note of the consensus on 
sending a letter, and the lack of consensus on allocation 
of 2005 payments.  On the latter point, he suggested a 
technical meeting in January to address the issue. 
Secretariat also reminded delegations of the Ngozi lunch 
 
SIPDIS 
with heads of delegations at the January session. 
 
---- 
PERU 
---- 
39. (SBU) The Chair reported that Peru has no intention 
to return to the Paris Club, but since it has a peak in 
its repayment schedule, it would like to partially 
buyback some of its short term debt to smooth out those 
peaks.  The IMF said it had approved on June 9 a 
precautionary standby arrangement.  On November 19 the 
Board completed its review, and a second review will 
occur in mid-February 2005.  Peru is just using the IMF 
arrangement to bolster investor confidence to carry it 
through its elections.  It has reduced its public debt 
ratios from 48 percent of GDP in 2003 to 40 percent in 
2004.  Debt humps will occur in 2008 through 2012.  The 
Finance Minister wants conduct market operations to 
perform this buyback.  The buyback would save costs on 
debt, improve duration and reduce the overall stock of 
debt.  The IMF supports the buyback proposal.  The World 
Bank said it is granting USD 950 million in new lending; 
it welcomes the buyback proposal. 
 
40. (SBU) The Secretariat noted the proposal would indeed 
decrease debt peaks.  The buyback discount rate would 
equal the exchange rate for long term debt, meaning 
payments at slightly higher than par.  The Secretariat 
supports the Peruvian request. 
 
41.  (SBU) The USDEL said it could go along with the 
Secretariat proposal, and promised to study the request. 
 
SIPDIS 
Germany said it is positively inclined to the proposal, 
it can go along with a market rate set multilaterally, 
and an exchange of letters would be sufficient to effect 
the operation.  Spain said it supports the proposal in 
principle, and is OK with the methodology.  Japan said it 
would like more time to study the details.  Italy is in 
principle interested, and is OK with the methodology - it 
is an opportunity to chart new ground. 
 
42.  The Chair said he would have the Secretariat prepare 
a letter reporting agreement in principle but requesting 
more details.  The issue will be taken up in January. 
Creditors should have preliminary views by then. 
 
------ 
POLAND 
------ 
43.  (SBU) The IMF and the World Bank reiterated support 
for Poland\'s prepayment offer.  The Secretariat 
circulated a working paper on how to calculate the 
discount rate for those countries that chose debt- 
servicing reduction (DSR), noting that debt for nature 
swaps would have to be interrupted to achieve the 50 
percent NPV reduction accorded in the 1991 Agreed Minute. 
Many countries expressed interest in the prepayment 
offer, with a slight majority indicating their intention 
to pursue the DSR option. 
 
44.  (SBU) Germany said it has chosen debt reduction so 
is not concerned with the DSR options.  Belgium agreed 
with the working paper methodology, and reiterated its 
opposition to being pressured to participate.  The 
Netherlands said it will participate and had already told 
the Poles; it chose debt reduction so the options are of 
no concern.  Japan said it might have been willing to 
participate, but it chose DSR so it will not participate. 
Italy chose DSR, agrees with the methodology, and has not 
yet decided whether it will participate.  Sweden chose DR 
and is interested.  Canada said one of its agencies, the 
largest creditor, is not interested, but the GOC and EDC 
are interested (DR option).  Denmark chose DSR, is 
checking the math and seeking authorization; a discount 
of 11-12 percent might be acceptable.  The USDEL is quite 
attracted to the offer; it chose DR and indicated it 
still had some internal issues relating to potential 
budgetary impacts of prepayment.  .  Finland chose DR 
option, and is interested.  Austria chose DSR, is still 
checking formulas but probably is mostly not interested. 
Switzerland selected DSR, is ok with methodology, but 
hasn\'t decided yet whether to participate.  UK has chosen 
the DR option, and is interested.  Norway chose the DSR 
option, and is still thinking.  Spain is not likely to 
participate.  France chose the DSR option, and agrees 
with methodology but is still thinking over its 
participation. 
 
45.  (SBU) Although many countries indicated interest, a 
number still needed to think about whether they would 
participate or not.  The Secretariat asked that creditors 
come back to the Secretariat by the end of the year with 
their formal positions so that the Secretariat could 
inform Poland of Paris Club interest. 
 
------ 
RUSSIA 
------ 
46. (SBU) The Chair reviewed the Russian offer, and 
before going around the table for reactions, noted the 
USDEL was the lone holdout on whether to set the discount 
bilaterally or multilaterally.  The IMF reported that it 
is still a bit too early to say the Russian government 
has reached a final decision on the Finance Ministry\'s 
prepayment offer.  Based on 2005 budget assumptions, 
approximately USD 10 billion would be available.  A 
bullet buyback would require borrowing from central bank 
reserves.  The Fund wishes to avoid relaxation of Russian 
fiscal policy, and in fact would prefer further fiscal 
tightening to bolster monetary policy goals.  In short, 
the IMF welcomes the prepayment.  The World Bank concurs. 
 
47. (SBU) Germany is pleased its comments to the working 
paper were incorporated, and is prepared to negotiate the 
Russian offer.  It prefers to leave securitization open 
as a consequence of failure (note: Germany securitized 
some of its Russian Paris Club debt in June 2004, to 
Russia\'s consternation).  The discount rate should be set 
multilaterally and be market based, as per the working 
paper and not per the Russian request.  Austria urged 
agreement on methodology, voluntary participation, and 
freedom to securitize.  Italy agreed to the working paper 
and a multilateral approach.  Netherlands favors the 
multilateral approach, might consider combining discount 
with Aries bonds, but insists on cash.  Australia has not 
yet decided, but if there is a three-year prepayment with 
the first year involving cash and subsequent years 
involving bonds, it would only participate in the first 
year.  Sweden agrees with the working paper, and will 
provide written comments to the working paper.  Japan 
agrees with the working paper and that the freedom to opt 
out should be included.  Canada is not interested in 
participating but does support a multilateral approach. 
Belgium, Denmark, and Spain agree with the working paper 
and stress voluntary participation, as does the UK. 
Finland said it is interested in the Russian proposal and 
supports the multilateral approach.  The USDEL 
acknowledged that it had argued for a strictly bilateral 
approach, to preserve voluntary participation, but would 
join the consensus for a multilateral approach, on the 
condition that Russia first clears all arrears to all 
Paris Club creditors.  The USDEL also noted the existence 
of USG contract prepayment clauses that allow prepayment 
without penalty. 
 
48. (SBU) The Chair took note of the consensus on the 
working paper, with emphasis on voluntary participation. 
He will therefore indicate that consensus to the Russians 
and will inform the Russians that the Paris Club will 
meet with them in January.  Germany proposed that as 
Russia is a Paris Club member, a classical negotiation 
format is unnecessary; the Secretariat could work with 
them bilaterally in advance of the next session.  Germany 
also posed a question to the IMF regarding the timing of 
Russian prepayment to the IMF.  The IMF said it 
understood Russia proposed to prepay the Paris Club 
creditors first, and then pay the IMF whatever is left 
over. 
 
------------ 
SIERRA LEONE 
------------ 
49. (SBU) The Secretariat prepared a draft letter 
granting Sierra Leone an extension so that its Paris Club 
treatment would coincide with the recently-extended IMF 
program.  The IMF reported that Sierra Leone had its 
fifth review on November 12, when its PRGF was extended 
by three months to June 2005.  Progress was broadly 
satisfactory.  The government completed its PRSP this 
month.  With a one-year implementation period, HIPC 
completion point (CP) could be considered end-2005 at the 
earliest.  The Chairman said that if Sierra Leone fails 
to reach CP, the Club would send another letter. 
 
----- 
SUDAN 
----- 
50.  The Chairman opened the discussion by asking what 
conditions the Paris Club would have for dealing with 
Sudan.  The IMF said a March 2005 Board date was set for 
Article IV discussions, and that a 2005 SMP was 
envisaged, using a Rights-Accumulated Policy approach. 
Any timetable will depend on the peace process and a 
resolution of the Darfur problem.  The IMF said funding 
for IMF arrears clearance for Sudan needs to be 
identified.   It also confirmed that financing assurances 
would be needed for a RAP.  Zambia had received a Naples 
treatment under a RAP in 1992, which could be used as a 
precedent for Sudan.  Norway said Darfur and peace 
agreement were requirements, and asked when non-Paris 
Club creditors would be advised of the need for financing 
assurances. 
 
51. (SBU) The USDEL also affirmed that no formal 
discussion of arrears clearance should take place before 
Darfur was resolved.  Responding to a question from 
Denmark, the IMF said the RAP could last 1-3 years.  He 
also said IMF HIPC financing could take time (one idea 
has been IMF gold sales).  Answering the UK question 
about getting non-Paris Club creditors involved, the IMF 
said under the IMF\'s lending into arrears policy, the IMF 
considers that financing assurances from Paris Club 
creditors extend to non-Paris Club creditors.  However, 
that Board decision dates to 1983, a time when Paris Club 
creditors were the largest group of creditors; however, 
now Sudan has large non-Paris Club creditors, so it would 
be desirable for Sudan to seek comparable treatment. 
Either the PC itself could consider contacting major non- 
PC creditors on Sudan\'s behalf (precedents exist), or the 
IMF could consult via ED\'s, per Iraq model.  The Chairman 
said Secretariat could contact; the German rep said the 
Club should avoid sending a signal to the outside world; 
the US agreed, reiterating that Darfur would need to be 
resolved before outside creditors were engaged. 
Minimize considered.

SUBJECT: MTAG 04 - 04:  DEMARCHE ON FRENCH FIRM\'S 
ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN\'S MISSILE PROGRAM (S) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 270425 
 
Classified By: EST Counselor Robert W. Dry for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (S)  On 30 December 2004, EST officer delivered a 
demarche to French Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) 
Point of Contact (POC) David Bertolotti, MFA Deputy Director 
of Disarmament and Nuclear Non-proliferation, concerning the 
10 December shipment of telemetry equipment from the French 
firm In\'Trad to Pakistan, with the possible end-user being 
New Technologies Islamabad, which is associated with 
Pakistan\'s ballistic missile program.  Prior to the EST 
officer presenting the demarche, Bertolotti asked if the 
issue pertained to a shipment to Pakistan, to which EST 
officer replied in the affirmative.  Bertolotti then noted 
that the issue had been raised in Washington, and that 
British government officials had been actively engaging the 
French.  Following these comments, EST officer then presented 
the demarche. 
 
2.   (S)  In response to the demarche, Bertolotti provided 
EST officer with comprehensive comments on the shipment and 
the reasons behind the Government of France\'s (GOF) decision 
not to examine its contents and to allow it to continue on to 
Pakistan.  The reasons provided included logistical 
considerations, timing issues, legal concerns, and 
insufficiently precise information.  Bertolotti said that 
while the GOF was fully engaged and concerned about this 
transaction, it was operating within the constraints imposed 
by French law, and that the onus of responsibility rested on 
the British and United States governments to provide more 
specific, actionable information regarding the purportedly 
illegal cooperation between In\'Trad and Pakistan\'s ballistic 
missile program. 
 
3.  (S/NF)  Bertolotti said that a British Embassy officer 
had brought this same matter to his attention on 10 December, 
only hours before the shipment was set to depart Charles de 
Gaulle/Roissy airport for Pakistan.  He added, however, that 
British security representatives in Paris had met with French 
security counterparts earlier in the day and had requested 
French intervention to investigate, and, if appropriate, to 
stop the shipment from departing France.  French POC told EST 
officer that his assumption was that the U.S. Government 
(USG) was acting on the basis of information provided by the 
British government, and was double-tracking the British 
efforts.  Bertolotti claimed that the eleventh-hour 
notification and the non-specific nature of the information 
provided by the British had left the GOF in an untenable 
position.  He then briefed EST officer on the legal and 
logistical hurdles the GOF had to contend with regarding the 
shipment, as well as the broader considerations that went 
into the French decision to allow the shipment to reach 
Pakistan. 
 
4.  (S)  Bertolotti noted that not all telemetry equipment 
was subject to dual-use licensing in France, and that the 
equipment may have, in fact, been legal for export.  He added 
that the 10 December shipment had already cleared customs, 
and that, short of a direct threat to the safety of the 
flight, GOF customs officials had no legal authority to seize 
and then search the shipment.  Bertolotti added that the 
imprecise nature of the information provided by British 
government officials supporting their concerns had made it 
all the more difficult for the French to take direct action. 
Bertolotti further remarked that, from a logistical 
standpoint, the request for seizure of the shipment had 
presented obstacles.  Primary among these was the fact that 
the physical location of the shipment was unknown, and that 
it could have been stored in one of twenty customs storage 
facilities at the airport.  Bertolotti also noted that a 
similar shipment of telemetry equipment from In\'Trad to the 
Pakistani National Development Complex (NDC) had been 
investigated and then cleared for delivery to Pakistan by 
British Customs officials at a London area airport on 04 
April. 
 
5.  (S)  Regarding plans for future French action and 
monitoring of In\'Trad, Bertolotti informed EST officer that 
French authorities had contacted the director of the 
four-employee In\'Trad firm, and that he had adamantly denied 
that the telemetry equipment shipped had been prohibited for 
export, and insisted that the firm was involved only in 
completely legitimate transactions. These denials 
notwithstanding, the GOF had, as of 11 December, begun to 
monitor the activities of this company more closely and was 
prepared to check all future exports from it.  Bertolotti 
added that, starting sometime in early 2005, the GOF was 
planning to begin an official, interagency investigation into 
the company, but added that this was a formal process and 
often took months to complete. 
6.  (S/NF)  Finally, Bertolotti noted that the GOF wanted to 
be more helpful regarding the suspect cooperation between 
In\'Trad and Pakistani missile entities, and to implement the 
necessary action against In\'Trad if the firm was, in fact, 
complicit in shipping prohibited equipment for use in 
Pakistan\'s ballistic missile program.  He added, however, 
that in order to take focused, legal action against In\'Trad, 
the GOF needed more precise information regarding the type of 
equipment being exported, as well as clearer indications that 
the end-users were associated with Pakistan\'s ballistic 
missile program.  He then informed EST officer that French 
security services had already requested more specific 
information from their British security counterparts linking 
In\'Trad to the NDC, but had not yet received any such 
information.  Bertolotti then queried EST officer if he knew 
whether the USG was basing its suspicions of In\'Trad solely 
on information provided to it by the British government, or 
if it was acting in part on corroborating information 
obtained independently of the British.  EST officer replied 
he was not privy to the sourcing of the information regarding 
In\'Trad, but would raise the issue with Washington. 
Bertolotti then requested that the EST officer pass on the 
GOF request for the USG to provide additional, more precise 
information that would aid the GOF in its investigation of 
In\'Trad.  EST officer replied that he would raise this 
request with Washington.  EST officer said that the USG in 
any event would appreciate French government investigation 
and enhanced watchfulness of In\'Trad

EPILOGUE 
 
REF:  (A) Paris 8860 ; (B) Paris 9110 ; (C) Paris 8612 
 
1. SUMMARY.  This is the last in a series of cables on the 
2005 GOF central government (CG) budget.  This cable 
analyzes the questionable assumptions upon which the budget 
bill was based, and analyzes the budget as finally passed. 
Final passage of the 2005 budget law occurred December 30 
with publication in the French Official Journal.  Despite 
expressing strong confidence in its scenario, the GOF 
nonetheless announced in January it would restrain 
spending.  In a marked shift of economic policy, the 
government has decided to subsidize job creation.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Unexpected Spending Related to Oil Prices 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  The 2005 French budget was signed into law and 
published in the French Official Journal on December 30. 
No significant modifications were added to the bill prior 
to passage, so details are as described ref B.  The budget 
assumptions, therefore, incorporate the biggest 
uncertainties arising at the end of the year, namely, the 
rise in value of the euro and increased oil prices.  The 
budget also assumes significant one-time receipts will be 
realized after partial privatization in 2005 of publicly 
held energy companies EDF and GDF.  EDF will transfer 7 
billion euro to the CG to pay pensions in the future for 
EDF\'s employees, who currently have a status similar to 
civil servants. 
 
3. In France, oil prices are exacerbated by a very high 
domestic tax on petroleum products (\"Taxe interieure sur 
les produits petroliers - TIPP). Former Finance Minister 
Sarkozy promised to provide 123 million euros support to 
groups hard-pressed by high oil prices, including farmers, 
fishermen, and truck drivers.  The GOF also planned to use 
value-added tax (VAT) receipts on oil to reduce the effect 
of the TIPP due to windfall VAT receipts.  After opposition 
arose from other EU members who argued such plans should be 
coordinated within the EU to avoid threatening competition, 
Sarkozy announced the creation of a special commission to 
examine a decrease in the TIPP.  Such a decrease was not 
examined as persistent oil price increases caused a 
decrease in gas consumption, reducing expected windfall VAT 
receipts.  Eventually, the GOF decided to pay an extra 
benefit of 70 euros to retirees receiving minimum old-age 
allowance (\"allocation vieillesse minimum\") to help them 
pay for heating bills.  Nevertheless, these new 
expenditures did not get added to projected 2005 
expenditures since the GOF was able to fund them with the 
windfall VAT receipts. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Despite High Oil Prices and Euro, GOF Sticks to its 
Optimistic 2.5% GDP Growth 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4.   Increasing oil prices and euro both cast a shadow over 
the GOF scenario when it introduced the CG budget in 
September.  But the new situation failed to dampen the 
GOF\'s 2.5% GDP growth forecast.  Since September, Prime 
Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has kept repeating that GDP 
is growing at a 2.5% annual pace, and he has never altered 
that prediction despite poor third quarter GDP growth (ref 
C).  He acknowledged that the rise in oil prices was high, 
but argued that business confidence remains high as well. 
Recently, new Finance Minister Herve Gaymard opined \"we 
have a forecast of 2.5% growth in 2005 which is realistic.\" 
The slide in the dollar \"should not continue\" and is an 
issue for U.S. and Asian monetary authorities, as well as 
European ones.  The OECD forecast a recovery in the French 
economy in 2005, but downgraded its GDP growth forecast for 
France to 2.1% from 2.6%. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Left and Part of Center-right Criticize the Budget 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5.  Communists highlighted \"insufficiencies of a budget 
that is far from addressing emergencies and needs related 
to rising unemployment and poverty.\"  Former Socialist 
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn described the 2005 
CG budget as a budget with no economic strategy, based on 
an unrealistic 2.5% GDP growth forecast.  His guess is that 
GDP growth will not be higher than 2 percent in 2005 as oil 
prices will be closer to USD 45 per barrel than USD 36.5, 
the assumption of the GOF forecast.  He also stated that 
the purchasing power of the French would fall in any case 
since social taxes will be increased by 6 billion euros 
(the social security deficit will be reported separately). 
He also warned against a net decrease in youth job 
creation, and no social progress since inheritance taxes 
will benefit less than 20 percent of the population and be 
costly (600 million euros).  Socialists and Communists 
criticized inheritance taxes and a 50 percent increase in 
the tax relief for employing domestic help, as gifts to the 
GOF\'s electorate.  In a letter to Le Monde newspaper, 
Sarkozy denied that the reform of inheritance taxes would 
only benefit the rich, arguing that 70 percent of the 
public approved the change.  \"The tax cut stems from the 
need not to penalize initiative, not to discourage 
individual effort, and it responds to the concern of many 
people that the fruit of their work should be handed on to 
their heirs.\" 
 
6. To respond to the criticism from the left, the 
Conservative majority made its \"Social Cohesion\" plans a 
priority, backtracking from its liberal (in the French 
sense) strategy of no longer subsidizing job creation to 
fight unemployment. 
 
7.  The center-right Democratic Union party (UDF) announced 
it would abstain on the budget if the zero-interest loan 
scheme to home-buyers (\"PTZ\") was eliminated, the increase 
in the tax relief for employing domestic help did not take 
into account the size of families, and if the GOF 
maintained its reform of rights to pensions paid to 
surviving spouses of retirees (\"pension de reversion\"). 
This new reform was planned as part of the 2005 social 
security budget.  Eventually, UDF passed the budget as the 
GOF backtracked on the pension issue, and listened to UDF\'s 
concerns about PTZ and the tax relief for employing 
domestic help. 
 
8.  Deputies contested several technical provisions, 
resorting to the Constitutional Council, which can review 
bills and strike unconstitutional clauses before their 
passage.  The Council suppressed a clause in the budget 
bill limiting the effect of measures designed to prevent 
job outsourcing.  As a result, all companies (not only 
companies located in certain zones) can benefit from 
professional tax deductions if they do not move jobs 
overseas.  The Constitutional Council also removed an 
article on the role of the Tax Council (\"Conseil des 
Impots\"), deeming that it was not a budget issue.  The 
initial idea proposed by former center-right minister Jean 
Arthuis was to transform the Tax Council into a \"Conseil 
des Prelevements obligatoires\" that could examine the 
spectrum of all taxes including social contributions (44% 
of GDP), and how taxes at large affect taxpayers.  The Tax 
Council is administratively related to the Cour des Comptes 
(roughly equivalent to the GAO). 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  The main problem with the budget is that the GOF 2005 
GDP growth forecast is too optimistic.  Even if the French 
economy grows at 2.5 percent, the resulting higher tax 
receipts might not be sufficient to reduce the budget 
deficit if even just a few budget expenditures are 
undervalued.  2005 CG expenditures amount to 242.7 billion 
euros, setting the deficit at 45.2 billion euros.  The 2005 
CG budget deficit could even deteriorate in absolute terms 
compared to 2004, since the 2004 CG deficit was revised to 
49.3 billion euros (ref D), and eventually adjusted to 49.5 
billion euros by the Parliament.  The GOF announced in 
January 2005 it is limiting spending by 4 billion euros to 
ensure stability in expenditure growth. 
 
10. Another troubling aspect of the budget bill is the 
reliance on one-time budget boosts.  There is nothing wrong 
with the one-off payment from EDF and GDF, which is a 
financial transfer similar to the 1997 transfer from France 
Telecom, but it cannot be repeated every year, nor resolve 
the structural budget deficit associated with the sheer 
size of the GOF.

SUBJECT: PLUTONIUM DISPOSITION: RESPONSE TO FRENCH 
PROPOSALS ON DRAFT MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT - LETTER DELIVERED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 4595 
 
Classified By: EST COUNSELOR ROBERT W. DRY FOR REASONS 1.4 B, D 
 
1.  (SBU) On January 10, EST Counselor delivered Ambassador 
Guhin\'s letter and talking points contained reftel to 
Veronique Vouland, Deputy to Francois Richier, and Sebastien 
Jaunet, both in the Sub Directorate for Disarmament and 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation.  (Messrs. Dahan and Richier were 
both unavailable.)  In response, Vouland and Jaunet remarked 
that the French government also considered useful a meeting 
with the U.S. to discuss the French proposals and revisions 
to the draft Multilateral Agreement provided in response to 
U.S. concerns.  They related that a French internal meeting 
had been held earlier in the day to identify possible dates 
for such a meeting.  They felt that a meeting well before the 
February 2-3 MPDG discussions would better suit French needs. 
 Thus, they would prefer a meeting date either on January 21 
or early in the week of January 24.  (Although early in the 
week of January 24 was not one of the dates discussed in the 
French internal meeting, Vouland and Jaunet thought that date 
would be workable.)  They seemed indifferent whether the 
meeting took place in Washington or Paris.  Embassy 
recommends Washington agencies provide a proposal for meeting 
time and venue for either January 21 or a date early in the 
week of January 24. 
 
2.  (C)  Jaunet said that the French side also wanted to 
exchange views with the U.S. regarding \'Cost Group\' issues at 
the bilateral.  He said that Ambassador Guhin had circulated 
a \'road-map letter\' containing evaluation of program costs 
and that the Russian side had prepared a document on the same 
subject.  The French had found the Russian paper \"not very 
encouraging.\"  Jaunet concluded by remarking that the 
plutonium disposition program was a key GOF priority which 
received high level attention and the GOF seeks to work 
closely with the U.S. on assuring its success.  At the same 
time, he said, there is not the same level of comfort with 
the Russian approach.  Thus, the French need to proceed 
cautiously to protect their technology.

SUBJECT: CHANGES TO FRENCH CONSTITUTION REQUIRED 
FOR CONSIDERATION OF EU CONSTITUTION 
 
Ref: 04 Paris 01928 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (U) President Jacques Chirac has announced that 
France will hold a referendum on the EU 
Constitution \"before summer\".  Before the 
referendum can be held, however, the French 
Constitution must be amended to insure that all of 
its provisions are consistent with those of the 
proposed EU Constitution.  This cable summarizes 
the proposed changes to the French Constitution. 
The calendar for adopting these changes will be 
reported septel.  End Summary. 
 
AMENDING THE FRENCH CONSTITUTION 
-------------------------------- 
2. (U) In his New Year\'s Eve address to the nation, 
President Jacques Chirac announced that France 
would hold a referendum on the EU Constitution 
\"before summer\".  The most likely dates for this 
referendum are Sunday, June 5 or Sunday, June 12. 
Before the referendum can be held, the French 
Constitution must be amended to accommodate the 
expanded powers of the European Union.  At the 
conclusion of his government\'s first cabinet 
meeting of the new year, President Chirac said, 
\"The European project is at the heart of our 
national interest.  In choosing Europe anew, France 
increases its chances for the future and gives 
itself the means to have more weight in the world.\" 
 
SHAPING THE AMENDMENTS TO MEET POLITICAL CONCERNS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
3.  (U) At that cabinet meeting, Justice Minister 
Dominique Perben presented the government\'s 
proposed amendments.  Primarily, these amendments 
aim at \"harmonizing\" the French Constitution with 
the proposed EU Constitution.  However, the 
amendments\' provisions are shaped so as to assuage 
key constituencies: those who believe that Turkey 
does not belong in the EU and those who believe 
that the EU improperly encroaches on France\'s 
sovereignty.  The proposed amendments provide for a 
referendum on eventual admission of Turkey to the 
EU and they provide for recourse for the French 
Parliament should it believe EU institutions have 
violated the principle of subsidiarity. 
 
4.  (U) Perben\'s first proposed article focuses on 
new procedures for amending the French Constitution 
so it remains consistent with the proposed EU 
Constitution, and makes clear that these amendments 
will not come into force unless all member states 
approve the EU Constitution.  Perben\'s second 
article follows up on Chirac\'s promise to let the 
French people \"have the last word\" -- by referendum 
-- on new members in the EU.  The article will 
apply to Turkey\'s bid for membership (should 
accession talks succeed) and to all future bids for 
membership beyond those of the current candidate 
states. 
 
5.  (U) Perben\'s third article strengthens the 
French Parliament\'s \"powers of intervention\" in 
regard to EU legislation.  According to the 
proposed text, the French Parliament will have the 
power to address its \"considered opinion\" to the 
European Parliament when the former believes the 
latter has violated the principle of subsidiarity. 
The French Parliament will also have recourse to 
the Community\'s Court of Justice.  Finally, the 
French Parliament will have the right to oppose the 
process of \"simplified revision\" as allowed under 
the current text of the proposed EU Constitution. 
 
BALLADUR TO PROPOSE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS 
----------------------------------------- 
6. (U) This \"season\" of constitutional amendments 
is seen as propitious for introducing further 
proposals to amend the French Constitution.  Former 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is leading a move 
to redress the imbalance in power over foreign 
affairs between the executive and legislative 
branches.  Under the Constitution of the Fifth 
Republic, the legislative branch is almost wholly 
confined to domestic affairs, thus leaving the 
domain of foreign relations wholly to the 
President.  There is nothing in the 1958 
Constitution that obliges the government to consult 
with Parliament on international issues. 
 
7.  (U) Balladur, currently chairman of the 
National Assembly\'s Foreign Affairs Committee, has 
introduced an amendment to strengthen Parliament\'s 
oversight prerogatives in external relations.  The 
main provisions of Balladur\'s proposed amendment 
would require that the President of the Republic 
send to the Parliament, at the request of the 
latter, all communications with the European Union. 
Currently, the President need only send to the 
Parliament those proposals having to do with EU 
legislation.  Matters such as setting the date for 
admission of new member states are wholly under the 
President\'s purview over foreign relations. 
 
GOVERNMENT OPPOSES BALLADUR AMENDMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
8. (SBU) President Chirac has forcefully criticized 
the Balladur amendments, calling them a danger to 
the separation of powers between the executive and 
legislative branches of government.  Prime Minister 
Raffarin made clear the government\'s opposition to 
any tinkering with the \"Fifth Republic\'s 
institutions\" during the National Assembly\'s non- 
voting debate on the decision to open accession 
talks with Turkey (reftel). 
 
9.  (SBU) Balladur, a long-time Chirac rival, 
remains adamant.  He points out that when the 
center-left was in the majority many on the center- 
right supported similar proposals to bring EU 
affairs into the Parliament\'s domestic affairs 
purview.  He also argues that his proposal does not 
tamper with the institutional arrangement of power 
since his proposal only gives the Parliament a way 
to \"voice an opinion\" and not any power to amend or 
reject Executive branch decisions in the area of 
foreign affairs.  Chirac senses, however, that the 
Balladur amendment could become the \"camel\'s nose 
under the tent\" that leads to further parliamentary 
oversight of foreign affairs.

TODAY\'S IMBALANCE STEMS FROM THE U.S. POSITION AS SOLE WORLD 
POWER, WHICH GENERATES NEFARIOUS UNILATERALISM AND UNDERMINES 
THE MULTIPOLAR ORDER EMBODIED BY THE UN. THE REMEDY TO THIS 
STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IS TO FAVOR THE EMERGENCE OF NEW POLES OF 
POWER THAT CAN SERVE AS COUNTERWEIGHTS FOR AMERICA\'S 
SUPREMACY, SUCH AS THE EU. THE OTHER OPPOSING VISION RESULTS 
FROM A DIFFERENT ANALYSIS OF EVENTS POST THE COLD WAR AND 
9/11. THE WORLD, ACCORDING TO THIS ANALYSIS, IS THREATENED BY 
GROWING DISORDER, AS ILLUSTRATED BY TERRORISM, ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM, NUCLEAR ARMS PROLIFERATION AND THE BIRTH OF 
NEW ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND MILITARY POWERS WHICH ARE STRONGLY 
NATIONALISTIC, LACK DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS, AND ARE THEREFORE 
IN OPPOSITION TO WESTERN VALUES. THIS VISION PROMOTES THE IDEA 
OF CONCENTRATING THE WEIGHT OF WESTERN DEMOCRACIES, AND FAVORS 
IN PRIORITY SOLIDARITY BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE U.S. . THESE TWO 
VISIONS ARE RADICALLY OPPOSED. AND DEEPLY INGRAINED IN 
NATIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL SENSIBILITIES. NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE 
PRAGMATIC CONSIDERATIONS OVER WHICH BOTH SIDES CAN AGREE: 
EUROPE WILL HAVE ALL THE MORE INFLUENCE ON THE U.S. IF IT IS 
UNITED AND STRONG; RE-ENFORCING THE TRANSATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP 
IS NOT A HOSTILE MOVE AGAINST THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THE ARAB-MUSLIM WORLD; THE MORE THE EU 
EXPANDS AND DEVOTES ITSELF TO STABILIZING ITS DISTANT SHORES, 
THE MORE IT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON AMERICAN MILITARY 
CAPABILITIES TO INSURE ITS SECURITY AND DEFEND ITS VALUES 
ACROSS THE WORLD. PRESIDENTS BUSH AND CHIRAC SHOULD FIND SOME 
COMMON GROUND FOR AGREEMENT OVER THESE FEW ISSUES.\" LEACH

Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Paul Mailhot, reasons 1.4 (b) 
 and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: GoF officials are stressing to us privately 
their high degree of satisfaction with Palestinian elections, 
but express concern that the post-elections follow-up will 
focus too much on what is demanded of the Palestinian side 
without pressing Israel to make gestures to the new 
Palestinian leadership.  The French stress that they would 
like to see more rapid movement toward final status issues 
than the U.S. and UK envision, but claim that they have no 
initiatives in this regard.  French officials privately 
question the utility of the UK-proposed conference on 
Palestinian reform, which they will support though they view 
it as duplicative and would have preferred an international 
conference with Israeli participation.  In an effort to 
re-engage on Middle East peace issues, FM Barnier will visit 
Israel and the Occupied Territories January 30-31 for 
meetings with senior Israeli and Palestinian officials.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Senior GoF officials offered effusive 
congratulations January 10 to Mahmoud Abbas on his election 
victory and stressed the GOF\'s determination to work with the 
Palestinians, Israelis and international community to seize 
the window of opportunity on Middle East peace.  FM Barnier, 
in January 10 press comments, described the election results 
as a \"victory for democracy\" and a \"first victory for peace\" 
and stressed GoF readiness to help Abbas proceed with 
necessary reforms and prepare for Gaza withdrawal.  Barnier 
also offered a positive assessment of PM Sharon, repeating 
his earlier description of the Gaza disengagement plan as 
\"courageous\" (ref b) and declaring that Sharon was up to the 
historic task now before him.  Barnier also repeated his 
earlier statement (ref a) that the \"test\" of the 
transatlantic relationship would be our collective capacity 
to relaunch the Middle East peace process.  Meanwhile, 
President Chirac, in a congratulatory letter to Abbas made 
public by the Elysee, commended Abbas for his courage in 
promoting democracy and rule of law, and pledged that France 
would be by his side \"more than ever\" in the quest for peace. 
 Chirac also encouraged Abbas to visit Paris at the earliest 
opportunity. 
 
3. (C) In a discussion with us on Palestinian and 
Lebanon-related issues (septel) January 10, MFA 
DAS-equivalent for Egypt/Levant issues Christian Jouret 
stressed GoF satisfaction with the January 9 election 
results.  Jouret praised Palestinian handling of the 
electoral process, which, with the plurality of candidates, 
showed that the Palestinians were ahead of other Arab 
governments in building a democratic foundation for 
governance.  Jouret also commended Israeli facilitation of 
the elections as \"pretty good.\" 
 
4. (C) After briefly discussing the election results, Jouret 
raised the UK-proposed meeting on Palestinian reforms, to 
take place in March.  Jouret questioned the utility of the 
London meeting, which the GoF viewed as duplicative of other 
international efforts, such as December meetings in Oslo 
which had already reaffirmed the international commitment to 
help the Palestinians.  Although the GoF would \"go along\" 
with the UK proposal, France would have much preferred for 
the London meeting to be a true international conference, as 
called for in the roadmap, with Israeli participation. 
Jouret quipped that the GoF was a fan of international 
conferences in general, as the U.S. was well aware in the 
Iraq context.  He added that GoF interpreted the London 
meeting largely as a UK effort to boost Blair\'s domestic 
standing, and some in the GoF viewed Blair as having become 
the U.S. \"spokesman\" in pressing the Palestinians to do more. 
 (Comment: The UK embassy has expressed private frustration 
to us over their efforts to consult with the French on the 
proposed London meeting, and told us the French were annoyed 
by the manner in which Blair announced the meeting during his 
recent trip to the region.  End comment.)  Jouret summed up 
that the GoF wanted to move faster than the U.S. and UK 
towards final status issues; he stressed, nonetheless, that 
the GoF had no initiatives to move the process forward. 
France remained concerned that waiting for the Palestinians 
to complete reforms that would take years to achieve, in the 
absence of gestures from the Israeli side, would leave the 
process open to disruption from Hamas and others.   The GoF 
also remained worried, despite its positive public comments 
on PM Sharon and his Gaza disengagement plan, that \"Gaza 
first would be Gaza last,\" and that the GoI would remain 
content to withdraw from Gaza and halt the process there. 
 
5. (C) Probed for details on what new initiatives France 
might take to help the Palestinians, Jouret offered few 
specifics.  He stressed that the Solana Plan remained the 
framework for European engagement to facilitate the Gaza 
withdrawal, and said that France would like to do 
\"something.\"  He added that Israeli resistance to a European 
role on security remained an impediment to further European 
engagement, and claimed that recent comments by PM Blair 
suggested that the U.S. was the only potential player on 
Palestinian security, as though Europe did not exist. 
 
6. (C) On a more positive note, Jouret reported that FM 
Barnier would visit Israel and the Occupied Territories 
January 30-31 to meet with senior officials, including PM 
Sharon, FM Shalom, Vice Minister Peres, President Abbas, 
FM Shaath and PLC Speaker Fattouh.  Jouret stressed that the 
GoF felt that it was the right time to re-engage with the 
parties and quipped that Barnier was perhaps the last 
European FM to travel to the region in the wake of Arafat\'s 
death.  On this point, he said that Barnier felt that he 
could wait to travel to the region to greet the new 
Palestinian leadership, since France had played such a major 
role in Arafat\'s final days.  Jouret compared the French 
attitude with Spanish FM Moratinos, whom he described as 
nearly seeking to \"kiss Arafat\'s cadaver\" during a December 
2004 visit to the region.  Jouret added that the Barnier trip 
would also serve the GoF\'s long-standing objective of 
improving bilateral relations with Israel, which was the 
focus of a Barnier visit to Israel in October 2004.  Two 
weeks after the Barnier trip, FM Shalom planned to visit 
Paris in mid-February to inaugurate, alongside the French FM, 
the new Israeli Embassy chancery building in Paris.

SUBJECT:  UNESCO CULTURAL DIVERSITY CONVENTION NEGOTIATIONS: 
UNESCO LAWYER DOESN\'T BUY OCTOBER 2005 DEADLINE 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary and Action Request.  UNESCO Senior Legal 
Officer John Donaldson called into question the October 2005 
goal for adoption of a Cultural Diversity Convention, noting 
that UNESCO rules and past practice are consistent with a 
four-year timetable, not the current two-year schedule.  He 
also said that the scope of the UNESCO Director-General\'s 
report may vary somewhat in scope from the October 2003 
UNESCO General Conference Resolution that began the process 
of developing a Cultural Diversity Convention. 
 
Post seeks Department guidance in evaluating Donaldson\'s 
reasoning concerning the October 2005 goal.  See 
paragraphs11-12. 
 
End Summary and Action Request. 
 
Conversation that Started on Scope Turns to Timing 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2.  (SBU) In the course of a 3 January telcon with poloff 
concerning the scope of the General Conference\'s Resolution 
setting into motion the negotiations for a Cultural 
Diversity Convention, Senior UNESCO Legal Officer John 
Donaldson turned the conversation to the normal timetable 
for UNESCO Conventions.  (Note.  Reso. 32C/34 \"Invites the 
Director General to submit a preliminary report.setting 
forth the situation to be regulated and the possible scope 
of regulation action proposed, accompanied by a preliminary 
draft of a convention on the protection of the diversity of 
cultural contents and artistic expressions.\"  End note.) 
 
3.  (SBU) Donaldson pointed out that the normal four-year 
process had gotten compressed into two years, which was 
simply not enough time to sort through the issues. 
Normally, he said, a resolution beginning the process of 
drafting a Convention would ask for a preliminary report 
setting forth various possibilities.  That preliminary 
report would be discussed at a General Convention, which 
would then make policy decisions and direct the preparation 
of a final report. 
 
4.  (SBU) Donaldson cited additional arguments to support 
his position. 
 
--UNESCO Rule E, which covered adoption of Conventions, 
required the Director General to distribute a \"final 
report,\" not a \"preliminary report,\" seven months prior to 
the General Conference.    Therefore, he noted, we are faced 
with the anomalous situation in which the DG is apparently 
gearing itself up for issuing a \"final report\" in March 
2005, even though the \"preliminary report\" mandated by the 
General Conference is not due until October 2005. 
 
-- Investigation of the wording of the resolutions 
concerning other UNESCO Conventions and the timetable of 
their adoption would bear the normal four-year timetable 
out, he said, noting that the materials are available on the 
UNESCO web site. 
 
5.   (SBU) In response to poloff\'s question about the 
timetable of the Underwater Cultural Heritage Convention, 
Donaldson said that he \"thought\" that the Underwater 
Cultural Convention took four years, even though there was a 
rush to complete negotiations at the end. 
 
6.  (SBU) Poloff, however, has been told that in fall of 
2003, the then-newly arrived UNESCO Chief Legal Officer, 
Abdulqawi Yusuf, opined in the context of the Underwater 
Heritage Convention that it was possible to develop and 
adopt a UNESCO Convention in one biennium, or two years. 
Relying on this opinion, poloff was told, the October 2003 
General Conference adopted the Underwater Cultural Heritage 
Convention.  (Comment.  The Underwater Cultural Heritage 
Convention is now viewed as an unmitigated failure in UNESCO 
circles.  Probably because the rush to complete negotiations 
left unresolved some important technical issues, it has been 
ratified by only a handful of states, with no further 
ratifications expected.  As top UNESCO culture official 
Mounir Bouchenaki told Ambassador Oliver in September 2004, 
the UNESCO Secretariat does not want the Cultural Diversity 
Convention to suffer a similar fate as the Underwater 
Cultural Heritage Convention \"fiasco.\"  End Comment.) 
 
Conversation on Scope 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) In the earlier part of the telcon, poloff asked 
Donaldson about the scope of Reso. 32C/34.  Donaldson 
responded that this resolution, like other General 
Conference resolutions, set forth guidelines.  Some 
development or change would be permissible, but he noted 
that the Intergovernmental report should explain why it had 
varied from the mandate. 
 
8.  (SBU) Poloff asked Donaldson whether there were any 
limits to how far the draft Convention submitted by the 
Intergovernmental process could vary from the Reso. 32C/34. 
Donaldson explained that it could not be completely off- 
topic, that it must be related to the mandate. 
 
9.  (SBU) Poloff pointed out that the question of the Saudi 
Arabian Ambassador to Donaldson at a 16 December meeting had 
been about a significant policy issue -- whether the draft 
Convention submitted to the October 2005 General Conference 
must cover \"cultural contents,\" as apparently anticipated in 
Reso. 32C/34, or may instead be limited to \"cultural 
expressions.\" 
10.  (SBU) Donaldson took the point, but responded that 
recent General Conference resolutions, such as Reso. 32C/34, 
had become much more specific in recent years, in response 
to previous UNESCO Director Generals, who had sometimes 
submitted reports at wide variance with the General 
Conference resolutions, effectively substituting their own 
judgment for that of the General Conferences.  (Note. 
Donaldson hastened to add that this had not been a problem 
with the current Director General, however.  End note.)  In 
this case, Donaldson concluded, the variance in scope was 
less important, as it was something the members themselves 
appeared to want, and not something imposed by the DG. 
 
ACTION REQUEST. 
 
11.  (SBU) Even though the words of Reso. 32C/34 require 
only the submission of a \"preliminary\" report covering the 
\"possible\" scope of regulating action and a \"draft\" 
Convention, the general feeling in UNESCO corridors seems to 
be that the General Conference is required to decide on 
passing a Convention in October 2005.   If, as Donaldson 
intimates, this timetable is not consistent with UNESCO 
rules, then the current momentum to finish the job in 
October could be slowed considerably. 
 
12.  (SBU) Mission would therefore appreciate Washington\'s 
analysis and guidance.

SUBJECT: NEGATIVE FRENCH RESPONSE TO U.S. PROPOSALS ON 
UNIFIL RENEWAL 
 
REF: A. STATE 4247 
 
     B. BEIRUT 65 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Paul Mailhot, reasons 1.4 (b) 
 and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary and comment: Senior MFA officials, stressing 
that they had consulted with the Elysee, rejected the 
U.S-proposed inclusion of a preambular reference to UNSCR 
1559 in the draft renewal resolution for UNIFIL (ref a), 
which they described as counterproductive to our shared goal 
of pressing for Syrian and Lebanese compliance with 1559 and 
potentially undermining the parties\' confidence in UNIFIL. 
The French appear convinced that even a minimal preambular 
reference to 1559 will effectively break the line of 
separation which France had sought to maintain between UNSCR 
1559 and the peace process, which will in turn serve Syrian 
claims that it will not withdraw from Lebanon until a 
comprehensive peace has been achieved.  French officials 
stressed their desire to work with us in New York to find a 
compromise on the UNIFIL renewal text.  They affirmed 
readiness to add tougher language on Lebanese sovereignty and 
independence and the need for Lebanon to extend its authority 
in the South, as well as more frequent reporting 
requirements.  French officials were less negative, but still 
cautious, on asking DPKO to examine UNIFIL\'s force structure, 
stressing opposition to reducing UNIFIL at a time when they 
believe we should be asking it to do more.  The French also 
suggested that including the 1559 reference in the UNIFIL 
renewal could complicate the task before new UN Special Envoy 
Terje Roed-Larsen, before his first visit to the region in 
his new capacity.  Syria reportedly asked Larsen to delay a 
planned early January visit for two weeks, during which the 
SARG suggested there might be unspecified \"positive 
developments\" on Lebanon.  French officials summed up by 
stressing their desire to proceed cautiously on looking for 
ways for UNIFIL to advance the objectives of 1559 
implementation.  Although French officials prefaced their 
January 11 remarks to us by expressing concern over perceived 
U.S. lack of cooperation on a UNSC press statement on the 
January 9 Blue Line clashes, we don\'t see the French offering 
a quid pro quo between the press statement and the UNIFIL 
renewal text.  End summary and comment. 
 
2.  (C) Poloff reviewed reftel talking points on U.S. views 
on UNIFIL renewal with MFA DAS-equivalent for UN/Political 
Affairs Jean-Pierre La Croix and MFA UN/Middle East desk 
officer Alice Guitton January 11, and with MFA DAS-equivalent 
for Egypt/Levant Affairs Christian Jouret January 10.  (Note: 
As the MFA IO Directorate has the lead on this issue, La 
Croix provided the definitive GoF response, which he said was 
made in consultation with Presidential Technical Advisor on 
the Middle East/Americas Andre Parant. End note.)  La Croix 
responded to our points by stressing shared U.S. and French 
objectives on Lebanon.  As co-sponsors of 1559, we shared a 
desire to promote Lebanon\'s sovereignty, territorial 
integrity and the restoration of Lebanese authority 
throughout Lebanon, and the GoF, like the U.S., wanted to 
reinforce these concepts in the UNIFIL renewal resolution. 
Nevertheless, the GoF remained convinced that it would be 
counterproductive to include a preambular reference to UNSCR 
1559 in the UNIFIL renewal, which, in the French view, would 
not advance 1559 implementation.  On the contrary, the GoF 
concluded that a 1559 reference would \"do exactly what the 
Syrian and Lebanese governments wanted,\" namely validate the 
Syrian effort to link its domination of Lebanon to lack of a 
comprehensive Middle East peace.  Contrary to U.S. analysis, 
the GoF believed that Syria would welcome a 1559 reference in 
the UNIFIL renewal in order to reinforce its \"chronological 
approach\" to enforcement of UNSCR\'s -- i.e, implement 242, 
425 et al, first, and then Syria can get around to 
implementing UNSCR 1559.  La Croix summed up by stressing 
that France, in pursuing UNSCR 1559, had sought to establish 
a line of separation between Syrian domination of Lebanon and 
the peace process; in the French view, a mere preambular 
reference to 1559 in the UNIFIL renewal would break that line 
of separation and slow prospects for implementation. 
 
3.  (C) Responding to our assessment of the common elements 
between UNSCR 1553 (on UNIFIL\'s most recent extension) and 
UNSCR 1559, La Croix stressed that support for Lebanon\'s 
\"territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence\" were 
elements of UNSCR resolutions long predating 1559.  The GoF 
believed that we could stress \"ideas\" or elements from UNSCR 
1559 -- such as the need for the GoL to return authority to 
the South -- and toughen references in the UNIFIL renewal 
text to Lebanon\'s sovereignty and independence, without 
creating a specific linkage between UNIFIL and 1559.  In the 
GoF view, repackaging UNIFIL as a tool of UNSCR 1559 
implementation would undermine the confidence of the Lebanese 
and Syrian governments, which in turn could affect UNIFIL\'s 
continued ability to carry out its vital mission. 
4.  (C) La Croix was less negative, but still apprehensive on 
the U.S. proposal to ask DPKO to examine the UNIFIL force 
structure.  On the one hand, La Croix said the GoF saw merit 
in asking DPKO to examine the efficacy of ongoing PKO\'s.  At 
the same time, there was a special context to UNIFIL\'s 
current situation in the aftermath of the adoption of UNSCR 
1559, and the GoF wanted to remain prudent.  In the GoF view, 
if we wanted UNIFIL to have any role in helping advance 
implementation of UNSCR 1559, it needed to be more active, 
issue more reports, and look more closely at elements 
relevant to 1559 -- all conditions which would suggest the 
need to preserve UNIFIL, not reduce its size.  The GoF 
believed UNIFIL could be a part of UNSCR 1559 implementation, 
but wanted to proceed discreetly and cautiously, without 
associating the Syrian presence in Lebanon with the peace 
process, and without weakening UNIFIL\'s ability to carry out 
its mission. 
 
5.  (C) Turning to French expectations of the UN role on 
UNSCR 1559 implementation, La Croix stressed the GoF\'s 
preoccupation with pressing for Syrian non-interference in 
Lebanon\'s upcoming legislative elections.  La Croix described 
Terje Roed-Larsen, newly-appointed UN Special Representative 
for UNSCR 1559 implementation, as the U.S. and France\'s 
\"ally\" on this issue and said the GoF had hoped Larsen could 
visit the region at the earliest opportunity.  Larsen had 
hoped to make such a visit earlier this month, but was told 
by the Syrians to delay the visit two weeks, pending a 
possible \"positive development\" on Lebanon.  (Comment: La 
Croix evinced skepticism that such a positive gesture was 
forthcoming from the Syrian side.  End comment.)  The GoF 
wanted Larsen to pass a strong message to the Syrians on 
Lebanon\'s electoral law, and have Larsen and his subordinates 
visit the region frequently in the run-up to the April UNSYG 
report.  The GoF had already specified to Larsen that it 
hoped the April report would follow the same format as its 
predecessor, namely list obligations on UNSCR 1559 
implementation, one-by-one, with an assessment of whether 
each condition had been meet.  La Croix added that if, by 
April, neither the Syrian or Lebanese governments had taken 
UNSCR 1559 into account, there would be unspecified 
\"consequences\" for French bilateral relations with both 
governments.  He added that the GoF was seeking to raise the 
European profile in pushing for UNSCR 1559 implementation and 
supporting Larsen\'s efforts; the GoF had successfully pressed 
for mention of 1559 in the most recent European Council 
declaration, and was considering asking the next EU General 
and External Affairs Council (GAERC) meeting to invite Larsen 
to attend and brief ministers on his efforts. 
 
6.  (C) Comment: La Croix prefaced his remarks to us by 
stressing the GoF\'s disappointment that, at the time of our 
meeting, the U.S. and Algeria were, in the GoF view, impeding 
agreement on a UNSC press statement condemning the January 9 
Blue Line clashes that ended with the death of a French UN 
observer in southern Lebanon.  While the apparent resolution 
of the press statement will improve atmospherics with the 
French in New York as we discuss UNIFIL renewal, in no way 
did La Croix suggest that France was willing to offer a quid 
pro quo or link the press statement with its position on 
UNIFIL renewal.  To us the French opposition to including the 
preambular reference appears quite firm, although the French 
appear ready to engage in New York on other ways to toughen 
the renewal resolution.  We also see little potential for the 
Elysee to overrule the MFA on this, as La Croix is an 
authoritative, well-connected interlocutor and we do not 
doubt his assertion that the Elysee is on board with the 
position he articulated.  At any rate, we will meet with 
Elysee Middle East Advisor Parant on the evening of January 
11 to press further on this issue and see if there is hope of 
bringing the GoF around on this.  End comment.

SUBJECT: CHIRAC LOOKS FORWARD TO 2005: THE TONE CHANGES, 
THE VIEW REMAINS THE SAME. 
 
REF: PARIS 00081 
 
Classified By: DCM, Alex Wolff, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY. During his traditional New Year\'s address to 
the diplomatic corps in Paris January 6, President Chirac 
stated his desire for good relations with the U.S. and 
extended \"friendly wishes\" to President Bush in advance of 
his inauguration (President Bush and UN Secretary General 
Kofi Annan were the only leaders addressed specifically in 
the speech).  Chirac said he looks forward to facing the 
world\'s challenges with the U.S., describing these challenges 
as \"opportunities to illustrate the vitality of the 
transatlantic link.\"  While the overall tone of Chirac\'s 
speech was positive and encouraging as regards both the U.S. 
and the transatlantic relationship, Chirac took the 
opportunity to stress issues on which France and the U.S. 
differ -- the importance of the Kyoto protocol and the 
establishment of an \"international tax\" to name two -- he 
finished with a reminder that \"the multipolar reality of our 
world is becoming more and more obvious.\"  Chirac\'s look 
forward to 2005 cites a myriad of challenges, among them how 
the international community will prepare for and administer 
emergency aid (a challenge brought to the forefront by the 
recent tsunami); establishing democracy in Iraq and the 
Middle East; bringing stability to the Ivory Coast and 
Darfour; reforming the United Nations; and dealing with the 
threat of nuclear proliferation and terrorism. END SUMMARY 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Chirac, the U.S. and the Transatlantic Relationship 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Chirac\'s address took a conciliatory tone towards the 
U.S. and the transatlantic relationship which were mentioned 
specifically five times in the course of Chirac\'s 30 minute 
speech.  Firstly, Chirac stated his intention to build a 
credible \"Europe Defense\" that will \"contribute to 
strengthening the Atlantic Alliance;\" he later congratulated 
President Bush, framing the world\'s challenges as 
\"opportunities to illustrate the vitality of the 
transatlantic link;\" and then spoke of the U.S. as a partner 
in dealing with Iran; a co-contributor with Europe for Global 
Fund replenishment and finally as an important world player 
which needs to be engaged regarding the Kyoto protocol. 
Chirac\'s opinions were not always in accord with U.S. 
positions, but the U.S. was portrayed throughout the speech 
as a partner. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
The Tsunami and Administering International Aid 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (U)  Chirac used the recent tsunami as a means to 
highlight both French involvement on the world stage and 
shortcomings of the international community to act in pursuit 
of a common goal.  He offered concrete examples of what 
France is doing in the region, stating that, at a ministerial 
meeting that he chaired just prior to his speech, he and 
French ministers decided to focus immediate efforts on 
providing access to drinking water and on preventing 
epidemics by setting up a field hospital in northern Sumatra 
and sending the helicopter carrier Jeanne d\'Arc to the area. 
 
4. (U)  He followed by stressing France\'s perspective for 
providing aid, stating that at the Paris Club meeting on 
January 12, France will call for an immediate and 
interest-free moratorium on debt repayment for the countries 
of the region.  For the worst-affected areas, he said, France 
will be proposing additional debt-relief measures following 
an assessment of reconstruction needs.  He said that he has 
already submitted a proposal that the G8 adopt a generous and 
coordinated approach to these issues to the British G8 
Presidency. 
 
5. (U)  Chirac said that in the upcoming January 7 meeting in 
Brussels the GOF would support a massive commitment by the EU 
to help the region by calling for all of the available 
resources to be brought together in a European Reconstruction 
Fund (see reftel for French Donor Support).  He added that 
France, like its European partners, is prepared to mobilize 
the financial resources required for reconstruction based on 
need assessments that will be announced in donor conferences. 
 
 
6. (U)  However, for Chirac, the tsunami provided not only a 
means to discuss the efforts France has made and intends to 
make, but also the shortcomings of the international 
community to respond to such catastrophes.  Chirac dusted off 
several long-standing proposals in his call for measures that 
he said would better prepare the world for future disasters. 
Included in his list of \"innovative funding mechanisms\" 
through which to increase development assistance was his old 
idea of \"international taxation\" which, he said, France would 
be raising this year in the G8 and the UN. (Chirac also 
brought up the international tax idea when discussing aid for 
developing nations in the context of reform of international 
institutions later in his speech.)  He stated the need for a 
worldwide early-warning system and said that France would 
contribute to the development of such a network and the 
creation of a \"humanitarian rapid reaction force\" which, he 
said, should exist within the framework of the UN. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
The Middle East:  Iraq; Israel/Palestine; Lebanon 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
7. (U)  Chirac said that the Middle East and Iraq are \"the 
most urgent issues\" to be faced in the coming year.  He 
voiced his support for the political process set out in 
Resolution 1546 and the reconstruction of the country but was 
also careful to stress that all sectors of Iraqi society be 
given the opportunity to participate in that process, \"it is 
essential that the largest possible number of Iraqis take 
part in it, thus demonstrating their rejection of violence.\" 
He underscored this by saying that \"all parts of Iraqi 
society and all stakeholders in Iraqi political life\" must be 
guaranteed \"their rightful place in the country\'s future 
institutions,\" implicitly referring to the threatened boycott 
by Sunni groups. 
 
8. (U)  Chirac was measured and optimistic in his assessment 
of the Israeli/Palestinian situation.  He praised both the 
\"maturity of the Palestinian people\" in finding a successor 
to Yasser Arafat and the \"courageous decision by the Israeli 
government\" to disengage from Gaza.  While he stressed the 
importance that the withdrawal from Gaza be a success, he 
also said that the Palestinian Authority must meet its own 
responsibilities and that the withdrawal must be coordinated 
with the roadmap which, he said, \"must be restarted 
immediately.\" 
 
9. (U)  As regards Lebanon, Chirac cited the implementation 
of Resolution 1559 as an example of further freeing the 
Middle East by \"putting an end to outdated arrangements.\" 
Implementation of the resolution, he said, \"will require our 
full attention, especially in the run-up to the legislative 
elections next spring.\" 
 
------------------------------ 
Nonproliferation and Terrorism 
------------------------------ 
 
10. (U)  The threat of terrorism was not prominently 
addressed in his speech, although Chirac mentioned 
bioterrorism and cyberterrorism specifically as \"new forms 
taken by the threat\" which demand an increasingly effective 
response.  He also said that France calls on the EU to be 
vigilant in destroying terrorist finance networks (\'tax 
havens\' in the speech) while remaining \"in compliance with 
our values.\"  The struggle, he added, must \"address the roots 
of terrorism, which are first and foremost to be found in 
unresolved conflicts with their attendant injustice, misery 
and despair.\" 
 
11. (U)  Chirac suggested that the EU3\'s dealings with Iran 
is a template to be followed when preventing the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  He said that 
countries abiding by their international nonproliferation 
obligations must be able to have the benefit of access to 
legal technologies while \"we must be unwavering towards those 
who fail to live up to their commitments.\"  These principles, 
he said, guide the EU3 in negotiations of a long-term 
agreement with Iran, in cooperation with other partners in 
the EU, Russia, the US and China. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Making International Institutions More Effective 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
12. (U)  Echoing many of the same sentiments he expressed 
when addressing the international community\'s ability to 
respond to disasters, and that he has put forward repeatedly 
in speeches over the past year, Chirac stressed the necessity 
to make international institutions more efficient and 
effective.  He said that the United Nations is the only 
universal forum for regulating international relations; he 
praised Kofi Annan as \"a man of peace, conviction, courage 
and integrity;\" and said \"2005 must be the year of UN 
reform.\"  He stated that next September\'s UN summit meeting 
will present an opportunity to implement reforms outlined by 
the Panel of Eminent Persons.  He reiterated France\'s support 
of Security Council expansion in both the permanent and 
non-permanent categories; creation of an economic and social 
governance policy forum and a UN Environment Organization; 
reinforcement of post-conflict management capabilities; and 
further progress in the protection of human rights. 
 
13. (U)  Chirac mentioned another international tax, this 
time in the context of development financing.  He said that 
the September Summit must be used to make the decision to 
double concessional financing and that he would continue to 
work with Brazil, Chile, Spain and others to develop this and 
other \"innovative mechanisms\" which are necessary to make 
this happen. He argued that an international tax could also 
support anti-AIDS initiatives.  He said that it is essential 
to raise an annual amount of three billion dollars at the 
Global Fund Replenishment Conference in March, with the EU, 
the US and other donors each contributing a third of the 
total amount.  Chirac added that France will be hosting an 
international conference in June on microcredit, which he 
said needs to be increased tenfold in the coming year. 
 
14. (U)  Chirac said that the G8 Summit in Gleneagles will 
provide an opportunity to engage the US on the Kyoto 
Protocol, which will enter into force on February 16.  He 
said the needs of emerging countries must also be addressed, 
as they must in concluding the Doha round of the WTO. 
 
15. (U)  In discussing Europe, Chirac mentioned the cultural 
diversity convention currently under negotiation in UNESCO. 
He said that he has asked the government to organize a 
meeting of European cultural leaders in Paris this spring. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
\"2005 will be a decisive year for the future of Europe.\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
16. (U)  Chirac spoke positively of the European 
Constitution, the referendum for which will be held before 
the summer break.  French citizens, he said, \"will look back 
and contemplate how far we have come in the last 
half-century.\"  The Constitution, he said, will \"lend new 
force to the European economic and social model to withstand 
the strong winds of globalization.\"  The Constitution, he 
added, will also give Europe a solid framework through which 
to develop ambitious policies, suggesting that the example of 
Airbus already points the way (he added he will be in 
Toulouse on January 18 with the Federal Chancellor and the 
Prime Ministers of Britain and Spain to attend the official 
roll-out of the A380).  He also noted that the joint fusion 
project, ITER, which he said should be located in Cadarche 
(France), will place Europe on the cutting edge of the \"drive 
to acquire energies of the future.\" 
 
17. (U)  As regards the integration of Turkey he said, \"our 
objective is indeed to prepare for Turkish accession.\"  But, 
\"we cannot rule out the possibility of a different outcome if 
that country is not able, or willing, to see the process 
through to its conclusion.\" 
 
-------------- 
Media Reaction 
-------------- 
 
18. (U)  French and international press made note of Chirac\'s 
remarks, seeing in them an effort to reach out to the U.S. 
Left-leaning Liberation headlined that Chirac was \"making 
eyes\" at the U.S., while the FT concluded: \"Chirac keen to 
mend relations with the U.S.\"  The Financial Times reported 
that Chirac\'s speech revealed a range of forward-looking 
proposals \"so freshly designed that they even seemed to catch 
some of his own ministers off-guard,\" while recent reporting 
in Liberation suggests that Chirac is pushing his focus on 
the coming ten years because he has achieved so little in the 
ten years he has already spent in office. 
 
---------------------------- 
The Fundamental Shift - Tone 
---------------------------- 
 
19. (C)  COMMENT.  Chirac\'s views put forward on January 6 
are not particularly new -- as he has on many occasions, he 
expressed his desire to increase the competitiveness of 
Europe and sees the Constitution as a fundamental 
prerequisite for doing so.  He repeated his view that the UN 
is the sole forum for reconciling international disputes and 
said he wants to implement reforms that will empower it.  He 
ratcheted up his rhetoric to generate development funds 
through an international tax.  There is, however, a new, more 
positive tone in his remarks about the U.S., which he 
describes as a partner in the effort to meet global 
challenges.  The question now is whether this change is 
merely rhetorical, designed to create a better atmosphere. 
Or, whether Chirac intends to take concrete steps to give 
substance to the new tone. 
 
20. (U)  A copy of the full text of Chirac\'s speech has been 
faxed to EUR/WE.

\"THE VENUE OF GUANTANAMO WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE IT CAME UNDER NO

PENTAGON\'S INTENTION, APPROVED BY THE WHITE HOUSE, WAS TO 
CREATE A ZONE THAT WOULD STAND OUTSIDE THE LAW, WHERE ALLEGED 
AL-QAEDA COMBATANTS. COULD BE DETAINED, AND ABOVE ALL 
INTERROGATED WITHOUT JUDICIAL CONTROL. A PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON 
ANNOUNCED ON JANUARY 6 THAT AMONG THE DETAINEES IN GUANTANAMO, 
AROUND 25 PERCENT HAD SOME `VALUE\' IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE.

(A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY\'S REPORT: 
 
1. U.S. POLICY - U.S. IMAGE 
2. IRAQ 
3. MIDDLE EAST - ABBAS ELECTION 
 
B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
PRESIDENT BUSH\'S OP-ED, WHICH APPEARED YESTERDAY IN LE 
PARISIEN, BUT ALSO IN OTHER EUROPEAN PUBLICATIONS, IS THE LEAD 
STORY IN TODAY\'S RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO, WHICH HEADLINES 
\"BUSH\'S SEDUCTION CAMPAIGN\" AND QUOTES EXTENSIVELY FROM THE OP- 
ED. THE EDITORIAL IS TITLED \"NICE AMERICA\" AND WASHINGTON 
CORRESPONDENT PHILIPPE GELIE REPORTS ON \"BUSH\'S ATTEMPT TO 
RESTORE AMERICA\'S IMAGE.\" (SEE PART C) 
 
LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION HEADLINES \"TSUNAMI: LIFTING THE 
DEBT.\" IN HIS EDITORIAL GERARD DUPUY PRAISES THE CLUB DE PARIS 
FOR EASING THE DEBT OF COUNTRIES HIT BY THE TSUNAMI, BUT ADDS: 
\"SOME COUNTRIES LIVE IN CONDITIONS WHICH ARE JUST AS BAD, 
WITHOUT THE TSUNAMI. THOSE WHO LEND TO THESE POOR NATIONS MUST 
ALSO REVISE THE GENERAL CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY FINANCE 
THESE COUNTRIES.\" 
 
LIBERATION CARRIES AN OP-ED BY SENIOR EDITORIALIST JACQUES 
AMALRIC TITLED \"IRAQ, FAR FROM WASHINGTON\" AND LEFT-OF-CENTER 
WEEKLY LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR DEVOTES ITS EDITORIAL TO \"THE 
HISTORIC TURNING POINT\" IN THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER THE ELECTION 
OF MAHMUD ABBAS. BUT EDITORIALIST JEAN DANIEL INSISTS THAT 
\"ISRAEL\'S AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S GESTURE TOWARDS 
THE PALESTINIANS MUST BE UNCONDITIONAL.\" DANIEL ALSO WRITES IN 
THE SAME COLUMN THAT \"HOLDING ELECTIONS IN IRAQ IN JANUARY IS 
A DESPERATE GESTURE.\" (SEE PART C) 
 
LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR ALSO CARRIES A COLUMN PENNED BY JACQUES 
JULLIARD TITLED \"FROM VANCOUVER TO VLADIVOSTOK!\" THE ACERBIC 
AND IRONIC COLUMN SUGGESTS: \"LET\'S ASK THE U.S. TO INTEGRATE 
INTO EUROPE. AFTER ALL WE NEED CANDIDATES OF VALUE. YOU\'LL SAY 
WE HAVE TURKEY? THAT\'S A DONE DEAL. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD 
ARMENIA. I LIKE ARMENIA AND THE ARMENIANS. FROM NOW ON THE 
ONLY WAY TO SHOW OUR FRIENDSHIP TOWARDS ANY NATION IS TO ASK 
IT TO INTEGRATE INTO EUROPE. SOMEONE WROTE THAT RUSSIA SHOULD 
BE INVITED. AND THAT\'S HOW I GOT THE IDEA OF INVITING THE U.S. 
I AM PROPOSING A EUROPE THAT GOES FROM VANCOUVER TO 
VLADIVOSTOK, BUT GOING FROM WEST TO EAST, BECAUSE IN THE OTHER 
DIRECTION EUROPE WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE FRENCH OR THE GERMANS, 
WHICH WOULD DELIGHT PRESIDENT BUSH. I CAN PROVE TO ALL WHO SAY 
THAT AMERICA IS NOT PART OF EUROPE THAT IT IS. BUT WE WILL BE 
UNSHAKEABLE ABOUT ABU GHARAIB, GUANTANAMO AND THE DEATH 
PENALTY. AMERICA\'S EUROPEAN INTEGRATION IS NOT FOR TOMORROW. I 
CAN SEE CHIRAC, ABOUT THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW, PROPOSING A 
REFERENDUM, ONCE THE U.S. HAS PROGRESSED TOWARDS DEMOCRACY AND 
THE SITUATION WILL LOOK ACCEPTABLE TO THE MALTESE AND THE 
ESTONIANS. BUT DO THE AMERICANS REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF 
EUROPE? THE TROUBLEMAKERS WILL SAY THE U.S. HAS NOT ASKED TO 
BE A CANDIDATE. NOT SO. HERE IS A COUNTRY WHOSE INTENTION IS 
TO LEAD IN EUROPE AND WHICH ALREADY DOES. HOW CAN ANYONE SAY 
THE U.S. DOES NOT WANT TO BE A CANDIDATE?\" 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
U.S. POLICY - U.S. IMAGE 
 
\"NICE AMERICA\" 
PIERRE ROUSSELIN IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (01/13): \"DURING 
HIS FIRST TERM, PRESIDENT BUSH DID NOT WORRY VERY MUCH ABOUT 
AMERICA\'S IMAGE ABROAD. SINCE BEING REELECTED HE IS A NEW MAN. 
NOT THAT HIS POLICY HAS CHANGED. RATHER THAN THE CONTENT, 
WHICH REMAINS UNCHANGED, WHAT WE MUST LOOK AT IS THE FORM. 
PRESIDENT BUSH WANTS TO BE CONVINCING WELL BEYOND AMERICA\'S 
SHORES. THE AID WHICH AMERICA IS BRINGING TO SOUTH ASIA IS A 
GODSEND FOR THE IMAGE OF A SUPERPOWER WHICH HAS BEEN CHASTISED 
IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND ELSEWHERE FOR THE WAY IT IS LEADING 
ITS FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND ITS WAR IN IRAQ. BY EXPLAINING 
IN THE WORLD PRESS AMERICA\'S ACTION IN ASIA PRESIDENT BUSH 
SHOWS THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY WELL 
BEYOND THE SHORES OF THE INDIAN OCEAN. FOR A U.S. PRESIDENT TO 
SHOW GREATER INTEREST IN WORLD OPINION DURING HIS SECOND TERM 
IS NOTHING NEW. BUSH, LIKE OTHERS, WANTS TO LEAVE HIS IMPRINT 
ON HISTORY. THIS DESIRE TO BE CONVINCING EXPLAINS HIS 
`EXTENDED HAND\' TOWARDS THE EUROPEANS DURING HIS UPCOMING 
TRIP. IN THE MIDDLE EAST HIS PLANS ARE BEING SERVED BY 
POLITICAL EVENTS: A DIALOGUE IS NOW POSSIBLE. BUT GEORGE BUSH 
HAS NOT GIVEN UP ON HIS BELIEFS. IRAQ OF COURSE REMAINS A BIG 
QUESTION MARK. WHILE THE U.S. PRESIDENT IS EAGER TO PROJECT TO 
THE WORLD A BETTER IMAGE, IT IS SO THAT HIS ACTIONS ARE BETTER 
UNDERSTOOD, HENCE MORE EFFECTIVE.\" 
 
\"A SEDUCTION CAMPAIGN\" 
PHILIPPE GELIE IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (01/13): 
\"PRESIDENT BUSH PUBLISHED AN OP-ED IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES TO EXPLAIN AMERICA\'S RELIEF EFFORT IN SOUTH ASIA. HE 
HAS TAKEN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW A DIFFERENT SIDE (OF 
AMERICA.) THIS GESTURE IS NOT AN ISOLATED ONE. IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST, PRESIDENT BUSH HAS EXTENDED HIS HAND TO MAHMUD ABBAS. 
PRESIDENT BUSH WILL ALSO SHOW A VERY DIFFERENT SIDE TO A VERY 
DIVIDED EUROPE WHEN HE UNDERTAKES HIS RECONCILIATORY TRIP NEXT 
FEBRUARY. BUT THESE GESTURES MUST NOT FOOL ANYONE: MORE THAN 
EVER THE U.S. PRESIDENT IS CONVINCED THAT HIS POLICIES ARE THE 
RIGHT POLICIES. THE NEW TONE ADOPTED BY WASHINGTON IS AN 
INVITATION TO THE WORLD TO JOIN HIM, BUT CERTAINLY NOT AN ACT 
OF CONTRITION.\" 
 
IRAQ 
 
\"IRAQ, FAR FROM WASHINGTON\" 
JACQUES AMALRIC IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (01/13): \"THE 
COMING CELEBRATIONS AROUND PRESIDENT BUSH\'S INAUGURATION WILL 
HIDE FOR A MOMENT, BUT ONLY A MOMENT, THE DETERIORATING 
SITUATION IN IRAQ. THE PREDICTABLE RESULT OF THE ELECTIONS, A 
SHIITE LANDSLIDE, COULD LEAD TO A CIVIL WAR. HENCE, IN 
WASHINGTON, MESSIANIC IDEOLOGY HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH 
PRAGMATISM. AND MUCH TALK ABOUT DEATH SQUADRONS TO DEAL WITH 
THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS. WHILE THE PENTAGON WANTS TO WITHDRAW 
SOME OF ITS TROOPS, THE FACT IS THAT, CONSIDERING EUROPE\'S 
REFUSAL TO GET INVOLVED IN THE IRAQI QUAGMIRE, THE U.S. MAY 
HAVE TO SEND MORE TROOPS. BUT JUST UNTIL THE IRAQI\'S 
THEMSELVES DECIDE THEY WANT THE U.S. TO LEAVE. WHATEVER THE 
CONSEQUENCES. BUT SOME REALISTS IN WASHINGTON ARE READY TO 
ACCEPT THE LOSSES OF THE IRAQI QUAGMIRE, A MONSTROUS GROWTH OF 
THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM. THE FIGHT AGAINST TERROR WILL 
CONTINUE WITH OTHER COLLATERAL DAMAGES THAT WASHINGTON IS 
ALREADY WORRYING ABOUT: GUANTANAMO. AND THE ACCUSATIONS ABOUT 
TORTURE., THE NOMINATION OF ALBERTO GONZALES AND THE TRIAL OF 
CHARLES GRANER.\" 
 
MIDDLE EAST - ABBAS ELECTION 
 
\"A HISTORIC TURNING POINT\" 
JEAN DANIEL IN LEFT-OF-CENTER WEEKLY LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR 
(01/13): \"THE RELATIVE SUCCESS ACHIEVED BY MAHMUD ABBAS 
EMPHASIZES THE FACT THAT THESE WERE FREE ELECTIONS. AS FOR THE 
DEFEAT OF HAMAS, IT IS BOTH REASSURING AND SIGNIFICANT. BUT 
NOW WE MUST BE CAREFUL. THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A 
DIALOGUE, BUT ONLY IF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF GESTURES ARE MADE BY 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND ISRAEL PROVING TO THE 
PALESTINIANS THEY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. BUT THESE GESTURES 
MUST BE UNCONDITIONAL. FRANCE HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT 
SETTLING THIS CONFLICT WAS ESSENTIAL. FM BARNIER, WHO PLANS TO 
TRAVEL TO THE U.S. EVERY THREE MONTHS, SAID THAT THE U.S. 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS WOULD SERVE AS A 
TEST TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TIME HAD COME FOR A TRUE 
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE EU. THAT THIS WOULD BE A 
GOOD START. BUT THERE IS STILL IRAQ AND IT APPEARS THAT THE 
BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS SET ON ORGANIZING ELECTIONS IN JANUARY, 
A FEAT WHICH LOOKS LIKE A DESPERATE GESTURE EVEN IN THE EYES 
OF SOME U.S. MILITARY OFFICIALS.  BUT BUSH INSISTS THAT THERE 
HAVE BEEN ELECTIONS IN AFGHANISTAN, IN PALESTINE AND THAT 
THERE MUST BE ELECTIONS IN IRAQ.\" LEACH
