SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  DESPITE NUMEROUS EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS BY THIS 
EMBASSY TO COUNTER QADDHAFI\'S INFLUENCE IN NIGER, 
THE LIBYAN PRESENCE HAS STEADILY GROWN.  THE SAIBOU 
REGIME CLINGS DESPERATELY TO ITS \"GOOD-NEIGHBOR\" 
POLICY, AND FEARS ANTAGONIZING QADDHAFI.  ALSO THE 
NIGERIENS PERCEIVE TANGIBLE BENEFITS FROM THE LIBYAN 
PRESENCE--AND NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.  THEY CANNOT 
FIND A LIBYAN HAND IN LOCAL DISTURBANCES 
 
3.  TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL APPROACH ON LIBYA, WE 
SHOULD LAY DOWN MARKERS WITH THE NEXT GOVERNMENT AND 
THE OTHER NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURES IN NIGER, 
INCLUDING PARTIES AND UNIONS, ABOUT LIBYAN 
SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES IN AFRICA.  BRIEFERS SHOULD 
SPEND MORE TIME ON CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF LIBYAN 
SUBVERSION IN AND THROUGH AFRICAN STATES, THAN ON 
MARGINAL ISSUES IN NIGER SUCH AS CW AND PALESTINIAN 
TERRORISM.  END SUMMARY 
 
------------------------------------------- 
LIBYAN INFLUENCE GROWS DESPITE US DEMARCHES 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  COUNTERING LIBYAN INFLUENCE IN NIGER HAS BEEN 
AMONG THIS EMBASSY\'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES FOR YEARS. 
WHILE WE HAVE READY ACCESS TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF 
GOVERNMENT, AND HAVE MADE INNUMERABLE DEMARCHES ON 
LIBYA, BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIFIC, WE HAVE NOT BEEN 
ABLE TO ARREST THE INEXORABLE GROWTH OF THE LIBYAN 
PRESENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. 
 
5.  TWO FACTORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO LIBYA\'S 
SUCCESS.  FIRST, THE SAIBOU GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MORE 
INCLINED THAN ITS PREDECESSOR TO PURSUE A 
\"GOOD-NEIGHBOR\" POLICY TOWARDS QADDHAFI.  THE 
REGIME\'S REASONING IS THAT IT GAINS NOTHING BY 
ANTAGONIZING LIBYA, EXCEPT FOR A GREATER CERTITUDE 
THAT IT WILL ACT AGAINST NIGERIEN INTERESTS.  WITH 
QADDHAFI NEXT DOOR, AND A COMPLETELY OPEN EXPANSE OF 
DESERT FOR A BORDER, LIBYAN \"DIRTY TRICKS\" IN NIGER 
WOULD BE MERE CHILD\'S PLAY. 
 
6.  SECOND, THE EXPANDED LIBYAN PRESENCE IN NIGER 
HAS NOT YET HAD ANY CONCRETE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, 
AND IN FACT HAS PRODUCED A NUMBER OF POSITIVE ONES 
FROM THE NIGERIEN PERSPECTIVE.  FIRST, THE NIGERIENS 
OBSERVE MORE LIBYAN COMMERCIAL UNDERTAKINGS IN THEIR 
COUNTRY, WHICH THEY EQUATE WITH INCOME FOR NIGER, OR 
AT LEAST FOR SOME NIGERIENS. 
 
7.  THEY ALSO SEE LIBYAN ASSISTANCE FROM TIME TO 
TIME, WHICH, ALTHOUGH NOT MUCH, IS MORE THAN THEY 
GET FROM ANY OTHER MAGHREB STATE, AS ONE NIGERIEN 
OPPOSITION PARTY OFFICIAL HAS POINTED OUT. 
MOREOVER, THE SPREAD OF LIBYAN INFLUENCE IS ALMOST 
CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL BENEFIT 
FOR A NUMBER OF NIGERIEN INDIVIDUALS, THAT PERHAPS 
DOES NOT SHOW UP ON THEIR GROSS INCOME STATEMENTS. 
 
8.  FINALLY, DESPITE THE UNQUESTIONED PRESENCE OF 
NIGERIEN DISSIDENTS IN LIBYA OVER THE PAST TEN 
YEARS, ESPECIALLY AMONG TUAREGS, THE GON HAS BEEN 
UNABLE TO COME UP WITH ANY RECENT EVIDENCE OF DIRECT 
LIBYAN ASSISTANCE TO AY DISSIDENT GROUPS IN NIGER. 
 
9.  IN OUR VIEW, AS LONG AS THE NIGERIENS LACK 
CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF UNSAVORY LIBYAN ACTIVITIES 
WITHIN THEIR BORDERS, AND AS LONG AS THE LIBYANS 
CONTINUE TO ADD TO THE NATIONAL WEALTH, IT WILL BE 
DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE THE GON TO CLAMP DOWM ON THE 
LIBYAN PRESENCE.  MOREOVER, WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE 
PROLIFERATION OF PARTIES AND AN EVENTUAL CHANGE IN 
REGIME TO CREATE A NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD LIBYA, SINCE 
QADDHAFI IS LIKELY TO BUY INTO RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
THE NEW POLITICAL PARTIES AND POWER CENTERS, IF HE 
HAS NOT ALREADY DONE SO.  WE HAVE VERY LIMITED MEANS 
OF COUNTERING THAT KIND OF EFFORT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
NEED TO LAY DOWN MARKERS WITH GON, PARTIES, UNIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
10.  THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH WE CAN TAKE TO 
MINIMIZE LIBYAN INFLUENCE IN NIGER IS TO CONTINUE TO 
LAY DOWN MARKERS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT AND NOW WITH OTHER POLITICAL 
ORGANIZATIONS (PARTIES, UNIONS, ETC.) ABOUT LIBYA\'S 
DESTRUCTIVE POLICIES IN AFRICA.  WE SHOULD PROVIDE 
CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF LIBYAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES, 
ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, AS WE HAVE DONE 
HERE IN THE PAST REGARDING BURKINA FASO, CHAD, AND 
BENIN.  MALI IS ANOTHER COUNTRY IN WHICH THE 
POTENTIAL FOR GROWING LIBYAN INFLUENCE (AS EMBASSY 
BAMAKO HAS ARGUED) IS OF DIRECT SIGNIFICANCE, GIVEN 
THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS IN MALI AND NIGER OF 
RESTIVE TUAREG POPULATIONS AMD POVERTY-STRICKEN, 
NASCENT DEMOCRACIES RIPE FOR LIBYAN EXPLOITATION. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
COUNTERING THE \"BENEFITS\" OF THE LIBYAN PRESENCE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
11.  TO COUNTER NIGERIEN PROPENSITY TO SEE THE 
BENEFITS OF THE LIBYAN PRESENCE, WE SHOULD MAKE AN 
EFFORT TO DRAW PARALLELS FOR THE NIGERIENS ABOUT HOW 
CERTAIN LIBYAN ORGANIZATIONS IN NIGER COULD 
POTENTIALLY WORK AGAINST NIGER\'S INTERESTS, 
ESPECIALLY BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE IN OTHER AFRICAN 
COUNTRIES. 
 
12.  BRIEFERS FROM WASHINGTON COULD BE PARTICULARLY 
HELPFUL IN THESE TASKS, BUT WE SHOULD WAIT AT LEAST 
UNTIL A TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE, IF WE 
EXPECT TO REACH POLICY MAKERS AND OPINION SETTERS.. 
MOREOVER, OUR BRIEFINGS SHOULD NOT DWELL AT LENGTH 
ON LIBYAN CW POLICY, SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN 
TERRORISM, OR OTHER ISSUES MARGINALLY RELEVANT TO 
NIGER\'S CONCERNS.  WE SHOULD BE AS NIGER-SPECIFIC AS 
POSSIBLE, IF WE WAWT TO HAVE AN EVENTUAL IMPACT.

REF:  (A) NIAMEY 2168; (B) USDAO TUNIS 091214 MAY 97 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CHARLES O. CECIL.  REASON: 
1.5(D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  WHAT HE LEFT BEHIND WILL BECOME MORE 
APPARENT IN THE COMING DAYS.  QADHAFI STAYED ABOUT 24 
HOURS.  THE MAIN PUBLIC EVENT WAS HIS ADDRESS TO THE 
FAITHFUL AT THE NIAMEY MOSQUE THURSDAY AFTERNOON, IN 
WHICH HE CALLED FOR THE ABANDONMENT OF THE FRENCH 
LANGUAGE IN FAVOR OF ARABIC, AND THE REPLACEMENT OF THE 
WESTERN, \"COLONIALIST\" SOLAR CALENDAR BY THE LUNAR 
CALENDAR.  NIGERIENS LINED THE STREETS TO WELCOME HIM, 
BUT IN NUMBERS NOWHERE NEAR THE MILLION CLAIMED BY 
TRIPOLI RADIO.  THREE LIBYAN AIRCRAFT--TWO 727S AWD A 
737--WERE ON THE TARMAC AT ONE TIME, AND OTHER AIRCRAFT 
PRECEDED THE VISIT WITH ADVANCE TEAMS.  NIGERIEN 
OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT THE LIBYANS TOLD THEM THE AIRCRAFT 
CAME FROM JERBA, IN TUNISIA.  OTHER REPORTING INDICATES 
OTHERWISE.  SOME OF QADHAFI\'S REMARKS MUST HAVE BEEN 
EMBARASSING TO BARE AND HIS GOVERNMENT.  MEDIA COVERAGE 
WAS DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO QADHAFI\'S STATEMENTS; NO 
NIGERIEN OFFICIAL STATEMENTS WERE BROADCAST OR PRINTED. 
END SUMMARY. 
---------------------------------------- 
THE VISIT SCENARIO 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF SUFIS TAKING 
PLACE IN NIAMEY MAY 7-13 SERVED AS THE FOCAL POINT FOR 
YESTERDAY\'S VISIT TO NIAMEY BY LIBYA\'S COLONEL QADHAFI, 
HIS FIRST VISIT TO NIGER SINCE 1974.  QADHAFI ARRIVED 
AROUND 9:00 TO A GALA AIRPORT RECEPTION COMPLETE WITH 
VARIOUS DANCING TROOPS.  THOUGH INVITED, AMERICAN AND 
EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS OR CHARGES (FRENCH, GERMAN, 
BELGIAN AND EUROPEAN COMMUNITY) DID NOT ATTEND THE 
ARRIVAL.  AFTER A LONG RECEIVING LINE, INCLUDING FORMER 
PRESIDENTS ALI SAIBOU AND MAHAMANE OUSMANE (THE FIRST 
TIME WE ARE AWARE OF HIS BEING IN AN OFFICIAL RECEIVING 
LINE SINCE HIS OVERTHROW JANUARY 27, 1996), QADHAFI AND 
BARE RODE THROUGH THE CITY STANDING IN AN OPEN WHITE 
STRETCH CADILLAC, WAVING TO THE CROWDS.  SCHOOL 
CHILDREN WERE DISMISSED TO LINE THE ROUTE.  MANY ADULTS 
DID TOO, BUT TRIPOLI\'S CLAIM THAT A MILLION NIGERIENS 
GREETED THE COLONEL IS A GROSS EXAGERATION.  THE 
MOTORCADE MADE ITS WAY DIRECTLY TO THE LIBYAN EMBASSY, 
WHERE NIGERIEN MINISTERS AND OTHER NOTABLES WELCOMED 
THE LIBYAN LEADER AGAIN. 
 
3. (U) THE 4:00 AFTERNOON PRAYER OUTSIDE THE MAIN 
NIAMEY MOSQUE, BUILT WITH LIBYAN MONEY, WAS LED BY 
QADHAFI, WHO ALSO DELIVERED THE SERMON AFTERWARDS. 
THOUSANDS ATTENDED, WITH A SPECIAL ENCLOSED AREA FOR 
VIPS.  THE SPEECH, REBROADCAST IN ITS ENTIRETY ON THE 
EVENING TV NEWS, WAS REMARKABLE FOR ITS MEANDERING 
REPETITIVENESS AND FOR ITS CONTENT. 
 
4. (U) AS BARE AND HIS MINISTERS SAT ON CARPETS IN 
FRONT OF QADHAFI, QADHAFI BEGAN WITH A FIFTEEN MINUTE 
RAMBLING DISSERTATION ON THE SOLAR AND LUNAR CALENDARS. 
HE CALLED UPON MUSLIMS TO ESCHEW THE SOLAR CALENDAR, 
WHICH HAD BEEN IMPOSED ON THEM BY COLONIAL RULERS, AND 
WHOSE MONTHS WERE NAMED AFTER PAGAN GODS OR ROMAN AND 
GREEK EMPERORS.  THESE PAGAN NAMES HARKENED BACK TO SUN 
WORSHIP AND POLYTHEIST GODS.  THE ADOPTION OF THE SOLAR 
CALENDAR IS PROSCRIBED BY ISLAM, HE SAID. 
 
5. (U) THE LUNAR CALENDAR, WITH ITS FOUR HOLY MONTHS, 
IS THE CALENDAR PREFERRED BY GOD.  THESE HOLY MONTHS 
ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS, SAID QADHAFI.  IF MANKIND HAD RESPECTED THESE 
HOLY MONTHS, PEACE WOULD HAVE PREVAILED EVERYWHERE 
WHERE WAR NOW RAGES, MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN THE 
DECISIONS OF THE U.N. AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH, 
LIKE THE SOLAR CALENDAR, HAVE BEEN IMPOSED BY 
COLONIALISM. 
 
6. (U) HE THEN TURNED TO THE FRENCH LANGUAGE.  FRENCH 
COLONIALISM HAD IMPOSED.ITS LANGUAGE, ITS CULTURE, AND 
ITS RELIGION ON AFRICA.  MUSLIMS MUST REJECT ALL OF 
THIS.  \"HOW CAN WE IMAGINE A MUSLIM WHO DOESN\'T KNOW 
HIS LANGUAGE, THE LANGUAGE OF HIS RELIGION, OF HIS 
KORAN, OF HIS GOD?\" ASKED QADHAFI RHETORICALLY.  \"GOD 
DOESN\'T KNOW FRENCH.  MUMAMMAD DIDN\'T KNOW FRENCH.  THE 
COMPANIONS OF THE PROPHET DIDN\'T KNOW FRENCH.  THE 
MECCANS AND MEDINANS AND THE KORAN ITSELF DON\'T KNOW 
FRENCH.  AFTER REPEATING THESE THEMES IN VARIOUS WAYS, 
TRANSLATED CLEARLY AND PRECISELY BY THE INTERPRETER 
INTO FRENCH FOR THE AUDIENCE, QADHAFI THEN CALLED FOR A 
NEW EFFORT, STARTING YESTERDAY, THE FIRST DAY OF THE 
NEW MUSLIM YEAR 1418, FOR A SPECIAL EFFORT, A SACRED 
BATTLE, TO RID THE WORLD OF ALL COLONIAL HERITAGE. 
 
7. (U) THERE WERE EVENING FUNCTIONS TO WHICH NON- 
MUSLIMS WERE NOT INVITED.  QADHAFI DEPARTED FRIDAY 
MORNING FOR KANO. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
ATMOSPHERICS AND ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) AIRCRAFT:  THREE LIBYAN AIRCRAFT WERE ON THE 
TARMAC AT ONE TIME.  THE SECURITY TEAM\'S AIRCRAFT WAS A 
BOEING 737 WITH TAIL NUMBER SA-DNJ.  ONE OF TWO 727S 
WAS QADHAFI\'S, PROBABLY WITH TAIL NUMBER SA-DIC.  OTHER 
TAIL NUMBER WAS NOT AVAILABLE.  FOLLOWING THE DCM\'S TWO 
DEMARCHES OF WEDNESDAY, THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE 
MFA CALLED THIS MORNING TO REAFFIRM THAT LIBYAN 
OFFICIALS HAD TOLD THE NIGERIENS THAT THE AIRCRAFT HAD 
DEPARTED FROM JERBA, IN TUNISIA.  WHEN THE DCM NOTED 
THAT THE AIRCRAFT WERE IN ANY CASE LIBYAN, AND ASKED IF 
THE GON WOULD BE NOLDING ANY OF THEM, THE SEC-GEN 
REPLIED THAT HE HAD NO INFORMATION ON THAT POINT.  WE 
HAVE OTHER REPORTS THAT CHARTERED TUNISIAN AIRCRAFT, 
AND POSSIBLY A BULGARIAN AIRCRAFT, ARRIVED BEFORE 
QADHAFI WITH ADVANCE PARTY.  WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THE 
CADILLAC GOT HERE.  SECURITY WAS VERY HEAVY.  LYBIAN 
UNIFORMED TROOPS, INCLUDING QADHAFI\'S FEMALE, MACHINE- 
GUN TOTING GUARDS, WERE PRESENT AT THE AIRPORT, IN THE 
MOTORCADE AND IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE LYBIAN EMBASSY. 
 
9.  (C) BARE: TV COVERAGE SHOWED A SOMBER AND 
RESTRAINED PRESIDENT BARE, SEEMINGLY TENSE.  SMILES 
COULD ONLY BE SEEN WHEN WAVING FROM THE CADILLAC. NONE 
OF BARE\'S STATEMENTS WERE COVERED BY THE GOVERNMENT TV 
OR NEWSPAPER.  MEDIA ATTENTION WAS EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED 
ON QADHAFI. 
 
10. (U) AN EDITORIAL IN TODAY\'S GOVERNMENT PAPER, LE 
SAHEL, EXPLAINED THE VISIT AS FOLLOWS: 
 
--\"IN OUR POLICY OF GOOD-NEIGHBORLINESS, IT IS 
INDISPENSABLE TO MAINTAIN PERMANENT CONTACT AND 
DIALOGUE.  IT WAS IN THESE TERMS THAT PRESIDENT BARE 
DEFINED HIS RECENT VISIT TO LIBYA.\" 
 
--\"NIGER...DESIROUS OF MAINTAINING PEACE AND SECURITY 
BOTH INTERNALLY AS WELL AS IN THE SUB-REGION INTENDS TO 
NOURISH RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING WITH 
ALL COUNTRIES WITH WHICH IT SHARES A COMMON BORDER.\" 
 
--\"THERE ARE NUMEROUS NIGERIENS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN 
LIBYA.\" 
 
--\"NIGER AND LIBYA...ARE TWO SISTER-COUNTRIES CONDEMNED 
TO COOPERATE AND LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE AWD RECIPROCAL 
UNDERSTANDING.\" 
 
---------------------------------------- 
COMMENT 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) IT IS IN NIGER\'S INTERESTS THAT IT NOT INCUR 
LIBYAN HOSTILITY, AS IT CLEARLY DID WHEN IT RE- 
ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL LATE LAST YEAR. 
NIGER IS SEEKING ANY LEVERAGE AVAILABLE TO SECURE THE 
RELEASE OF THE CANADIAN AND NIGERIEN HOSTAGES HELD BY 
TOUBOU TRIBESMEN IN THE NORTH.  MANY NGOS HAVE WRITTEN 
THE GON IN RECENT WEEKS, STRESSING THE NECESSITY OF 
BRINGING TNE HOSTAGE SITUATION TO AN END IF THESE NGOS 
ARE TO BE EXPECTED TO CARRY OUT PROJECTS IN THE 
NORTHERN AND EASTERN REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  THE GON 
NEEDS TNE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE NGOS AND IS SEARCHING 
FOR ANY HELP, INCLUDING LIBYAN, TO BRING IT TO AN END. 
 
12. (C) TO THE EXTENT THAT THE USG CARES ABOUT HUNT 
OIL\'S ABILITY TO DRILL ITS WELLS IN THE NORTH OF NIGER 
WITHOUT ITS EMPLOYEES BEING TAKEN HOSTAGE, OR WITHOUT 
LIBYA ASSERTING CLAIMS TO NIGER\'S UNDEMARCATED 
FRONTIER, IT IS IN THE USG\'S INTEREST THAT NIGER-LIBYAN 
RELATIONS BE FREE OF RANCOR. 
 
13. (C) MANY OF THE NIGERIENS ON THE STREET, BESIDES 
THE SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO WERE TAKEN THERE BY THEIR 
TEACHERS, WERE THERE OUT OF A MIXTURE OF MOTIVATIONS. 
THE GOVERNMENT ASKED THEM TO LINE THE STREETS; THOSE 
WHO SUPPORT THIS GOVERNMENT DID SO, BUT SO DID OTHERS. 
(LE SANEL MADE A POINT OF THANKING FRDD LEADERS FOR 
ENCOURAGING TNEIR MEMBERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE 
DEMONSTRATION OF PUBLIC WELCOME.)  MANY NIGERIENS, 
ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LITTLE EDUCATION, ASSOCIATE LIBYA 
WITH A POSITIVE IMAGE OF MONEY, WORK, AND CONSUMER 
GOODS; THEY WANT THE BORDER OPEN, SO THEY CAN WORK AND 
BRING GOODS HOME.  THEY ARE LESS CONSCIOUS OF THE 
OPINION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CONCERNING 
COLONEL QADHAFI. 
 
14. (C) WESTERNERS WHO DON\'T NORMALLY LISTEN TO COLONEL 
QADHAFI, OR READ HIS SPEECHES, MAY OVERREACT TO HIS 
REPETITIOUS, SIMPLISTIC, ANTI-WESTERN EXHORTATIONS. 
NEVERTHELESS, MOST EDUCATED NIGERIENS VALUE THEIR 
FRENCH EDUCATION AND THEIR AFFINITY FOR FRENCH CULTURE, 
EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY CRITICIZE FRENCH GOVERNMENT POLICY 
AND HEAVY-HANDEDNESS IN SEEKING ECONOMIC DOMINATION 
OVER FRANCOPNONE COUNTRIES.  THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO 
LEARN ARABIC NOR ADOPT THE LUNAR CALENDAR.  HEARING THE 
LEADER OF A RICH NATION ADVOCATE SUCH MEASURES IN ALL 
SERIOUSNES MAY BOTH AMUSE THEM AND PUT THEM ON GUARD. 
THIS IS NOT A MAN ONE WANTS TO GET ON THE WRONG SIDE 
OF.  THE LESS EDUCATED, HOWEVER, MAY FIND HIS 
SIMPLISTIC AND REPETITIVE ARGUMENTS EASY TO UNDERSTAND 
AND REPEAT, AND LOOK TO RELIGION FOR SURCEASE OF SORROW 
IN TIMES OF ECONOMIC DEPRIVATION.  BECAUSE THERE ARE A 
LOT MORE OF THE LATTER IN NIGER THAN OF THE FORMER (THE 
EDUCATED) ANY NIGERIEN GOVERNMENT MUST TREAT QADHAFI 
WITH CARE.

SUBJECT:  ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM, IRAN, AND NIGER 
 
REF: NIAMEY 3264 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR CHARLES O. CECIL. REASON: 
1.5(D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  MOST NIGERIENS BELIEVE ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM CONSTITUTES A LONG-TERM THREAT TO THE 
SECULAR STATE ESTABLISHED UNDER NIGER\'S CONSTITUTION. 
IRAN IS WORKING QUIETLY AND WITH SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES 
TO PROMOTE SHI\'ISM IN NIGER.  SHIA RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN 
NORTHERN NIGERIA ARE ALSO A FORCE FOR CONSERVATISM IN 
THE MARADI AREA OF NIGER.  GON OFFICIALS ARE SUSPICIOUS 
OF IRAN, BUT FOR THE MOMENT TOLERATE ITS PRESENCE AND 
ITS ACTIVITIES, PROBABLY IN THE HOPE OF RECEIVING 
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FROM THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE 
FUTURE.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE GON IS DETERMINED TO TAKE 
STRONG ACTIONS AGAINST THE EXPRESSION OF FUNDAMENTALIST, 
SHIA DOCTRINES WITH THE AIM OF MINIMIZING NIGERIAN 
INFLUENCE IN NIGERIEN RELIGIOUS CIRCLES.  POVERTY AND 
DESPAIR MAY BE A GREATER SOURCE OF CONSERVATIVE AND 
FUNDAMENTALIST TENDENCIES IN NIGER THAN EITHER OF THESE 
TWO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES, BUT TNE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES CAN 
REINFORCE SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS TRENDS ALREADY UNDER WAY. 
REDUCING NIGER\'S POVERTY IS LIKELY TO BE THE MOST 
PRODUCTIVE WAY TO HALT THE SPREAD OF FUNDAMENTALIST 
IDEAS IN NIGER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
IS ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM A THREAT TO NIGER? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) \"EXTREME POVERTY IS A GREATER CAUSE OF ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM THAN IRANIAN EFFORTS,\" SAID FORMER PRIME 
MINISTER HAMA AMADOU TO AMBASSADOR CECIL OVER LUNCH ON 
OCTOBER 23.  \"WHETHER FUNDAMENTALISM GROWS OR NOT WILL 
DEPEND ON WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT MAKES PROGRESS IN 
COMBATTING POVERTY,\" ADDED AMADOU.  IN NIGER\'S CURRENT 
POSITION (NUMBER 173 OUT OF 175 COUNTRIES) ON THE UNDP\'S 
1997 REPORT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, ONE WOULD HAVE TO 
CONCLUDE THAT NIGER IS ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE GROUNDS 
ONE COULD FIND FOR FUNDAMENTALISM TO TAKE ROOT. 
 
3.  (U) GON OFFICIALS TAKE THE THREAT OF FUNDAMENTALISM 
SERIOUSLY; A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR 
DETERMINATION THAT IT NOT SPREAD.  MARADI AND ITS 
NEIGHBOR GUIDAN-ROUMDJI ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE CENTER 
OF FUNDAMENTALIST TENDENCIES IN NIGER; SOME MUSLIMS IN 
THAT AREA CONSIDER TNEMSELVES SHI\'ITES.  ACCORDING TO 
THE FORMER PREFET OF MARADI, LTC MALLAM OUBANDAWAKI, 
FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENTS IN NIGER DATE FROM THE 1980S. 
(OBVIOUSLY THE COLONEL WAS THINKING IN MODERN TERMS OF 
REFERENCE.  MANY HISTORIANS QE THE REFORM MOVEMENT LED 
BY OUSMANE DAN FODIO IN NORTHERN NIGERIA AROUND 1800 AS 
A FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT, THAT IS, A RETURN TO THE 
LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THE KORAN AND ITS STRICT 
APPLICATION TO DAILY LIFE.)  IN THE 1990S THESE EARLIER 
FUNDAMENTALIST TENDENCIES HAVE BECOME MORE VIGOROUS, 
SAID THE COLONEL, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE WAVE OF 
DEMOCRATIZATION SWEEPING THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. 
OUBANDAWAKI CONSIDERS THE ORIGIN OF THESE FUNDAMENTALIST 
TENDENCIES TO BE NORTHERN NIGERIA, WHERE CERTAIN 
RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE DIRECTING A CONSCIOUS CAMPAIGN TO 
SPREAD THEIR VERSION OF ISLAM INTO NIGER.  THE OBJECTIVE 
OF THE FUNDAMENTALISTS, IN THE COLONEL\'S VIEW, IS TO 
ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE IN WHICN SHARIA LAW IS THE 
LAW OF THE LAND. 
 
4.  (U) MINISTER OF INTERIOR IDI ANGO OMAR, IN JANUARY, 
TRACED THE RISE OF FUNDAMENTALISM IN NIGER BACK TO 1989. 
PUTTING HIS OWN SPECIAL TWIST ON IT, HE ACCUSED THE 
FUNDAMENTALISTS OF BEING INCLINED TO USE VIOLENCE TO 
SPREAD THEIR VIEWS, AND ACCUSED THEM OF WORKING IN 
CONCERT WITH THE OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT BARE, WHICH WAS 
AT THE TIME PREPARING A SERIES OF PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS 
TO MARK THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE BARE COUP. 
 
5. (C) FORMER GENDARMERIE COMMAWDER GENERAL YOUSOUFA 
MAIGA, NOW AMBASSADOR TO ALGERIA, EXPRESSED TO THE 
AMBASSADOR HIS OWN CONCERN OVER FUWDAMENTALISM, CITING 
IRANIAN ADVERTISEMENTS AND ACTIVITIES, PLUS AN EID AL- 
FITR CLASH BETWEEN SHI\'ITES AND SECURITY FORCES IN THE 
MARADI AREA LAST FEBRUARY.  MAIGA VOWED THAT THE GON 
WOULD NOT LET FUNDAMENTALISM GET OUT OF CONTROL.  IN THE 
INCIDENT REFERRED TO, SHIA MUSLIMS HAD WANTED TO 
CELEBRATE THE EID AL-FITR A DAY LATER THAN THE OFFICIAL 
DAY OBSERVED BY NIGER\'S SUNNI MAJORITY, BUT SECURITY 
FORCES STOPPED THE OBSERVANCE.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED 
NIGER\'S FORMER DCM FROM ITS WASHINGTON EMBASSY WHY THIS 
POINT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT TO GON AUTHORITIES.  HE GAVE 
TWO REASONS.  FIRST, ISLAM IS A COMMUNAL RELIGION; THE 
COMMUNITY IS SUPPOSED TO DO IT TOGETHER.  \"IF 900 PEOPLE 
WANT TO CELEBRATE A FESTIVAL ON A CERTAIN DAY, YOU CAN\'T 
HAVE 100 OTHERS DOING IT SOME OTHER TIME.  IT ISN\'T 
RIGHT,\" HE SAID.  SECONDLY, THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO 
MINIMIZE NIGERIAN INFLUENCE BECAUSE NIGERIANS ARE MORE 
PRONE TO VIOLENCE THAN ARE NIGERIENS.  NIGERIA\'S ISLAMIC 
CALENDAR HAS OFTEN PUT IT ONE DAY OFF THE CALENDAR 
OBSERVED IN NIGER, SAID THE DCM; IT\'S A SMALL POINT BUT 
IT CAN\'T BE IGNORED.  ANOTHER NIGERIEN SAID THAT THE 
SHIAS ARE JUST TESTING THE GOVERNMENT.  IF THEY GET AWAY 
WITH ONE SMALL CHANGE, THEN THEY WILL FEEL EMBOLDENED, 
AND PRESS FOR OTHERS. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
IRAN\'S ROLE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) CERTAIN EVIDENCE OF IRAN\'S PRESENCE AND ACTIVITY 
CAN BE EASILY SEEN IN NIAMEY: A SCHOOL, A HEALTH CLINIC, 
AND A SMALL TRADE FAIR LAST JANUARY.  THE SCHOOL ACCEPTS 
NIGERIEN CHILDREN FROM AGE FIVE THROUGH THE LATE TEENAGE 
YEARS.  WHEN THE FORMER ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED 
CONCERN OVER THE SCHOOL TO GON OFFICIALS, HE WAS TOLD 
THAT PERMISSION HAD NEVER BEEN GIVEN TO OPEN IT AND THAT 
IT WOULD BE CLOSED, BUT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET. 
ACCORDING TO THE ALGERIAN, PATIENTS AT THE CLINIC, WHICH 
OFFERS FREE CARE FOR THE NEEDIEST, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO 
SHIA INDOCTRINATION.  ONE SOUS-PREFET TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT WHEN SUNNI MUSLIMS BECOME SHIAS, THE 
IRANIANS REWARD THEM WITH MONEY TO BUY NEW CLOTHES \"SO 
THAT THEY CAN BE PROPERLY DRESSED WHEN THEY GO TO THE 
MOSQUE.\"  IN JUNE THE FORMER SAUDI CHARGE TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT THE IRANIANS WERE SPENDING A LOT OF 
MONEY IN NIGER TO PROMOTE THEIR RELIGION AND THEIR 
IMAGE.  HE DID NOT THINK THEY WERE ACHIEVING MUCH, BUT 
ADDED THAT THEY WERE TAKING THE LONG-TERM VIEW. THE 
TRADE FAIR LASTED A WEEK AND CONSISTED OF HANDICRAFTS 
AND SMALL MANUFACTURED ITEMS DISPLAYED BY 24 FIRMS.  THE 
EXHIBIT WAS OPENED BY THE DIRECTOR OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS IN 
THE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, IDENTIFIED AS A MR. \"JENID 
(ALSO \"DJAWID\") GHORBER OGHLI\" (SIC).  THE OTHER IRANIAN 
VISITOR OF NOTE DURING THE YEAR WAS THE MINISTER OF 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS WHO CAME ON JULY 12 AS PART OF A 
REGIONAL TRIP SOLICITING SUPPORT FOR THE HOLDING OF THE 
OIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE IN TEHRAN IN DECEMBER. 
 
7.  (C) IRANIAN ACTIVITY IN NIGER IS REGARDED WITH 
SUSPICION BY THE GON.  PRESIDENT BARE TOLD THE ALGERIAN. 
AMBASSADOR RECENTLY THAT THE GON KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON 
IN THE IRANIAN SCHOOL AND THE CLINIC AND THAT ALL 
IRANIAN ACTIVITIES \"ARE CLOSELY MONITORED.\"  BARE TOLD 
AMBASSADOR CECIL IN SEPTEMBER QUITE EMPHATICALLY THAT 
NIGER (HE HAS TO MEAN THE GOVERNMENT) HAS RECEIVED NOT 
ONE DOLLAR FROM IRAN.  IT IS TRUE THAT SEVENTEEN 
NIGERIENS WERE GIVEN UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STUDY 
IN IRAN SOMETIME IN THE LAST YEAR, BUT WHEN ONE RETURNED 
TO NIGER TO REPORT THAT ALL HAD BEEN SENT TO QUM WHERE 
THEY WERE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS IN THE USE OF ARMS, THE GON 
CALLED THEM ALL BACK AND THERE ARE NOW NONE THERE. 
 
8.  (C) THIS DISTRUST OF IRAN MAKES IT HARD TO 
UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE BEHIND FOREIGN MINISTER 
MAYAKI\'S JUNE VISIT TO TEHRAN, AFTER WHICH IT WAS 
ANNOUNCED THAT IRAN AND NIGER WOULD RAISE THEIR 
RELATIONS TO THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL.  (IRAN IS 
REPRESENTED BY A PERMANENT CHARGE IN NIAMEY; NIGER HAS . 
NO REPRESENTATIVE IN TEHRAN.)  ACCORDING TO THE FORMER 
ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR, IRAN OFFERED TO PAY RENT, 
UTILITIES, AND TELEPHONE FOR A NIGERIEN EMBASSY IN 
TEHRAN.  FORNMIN MAYAKI TOLD THE ALGERIAN THAT HE NEVER 
AGREED TO ESTABLISH AN EMBASSY IN TEHRAN--MERELY TO 
ELEVATE RELATIONS TO THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL.  NIGER\'S 
CLOSEST AMBASSADORS IN THE AREA ARE IN RIYADH, KUWAIT, 
AND CAIRO.  AMBASSADOR CECIL HAS ASKED NUMEROUS GON 
OFFICIALS FOR THEIR VIEWS CONCERNING THE REASONS FOR 
ELEVATING NIGERIEN-IRANIAN RELATIONS, BUT NONE HAVE 
GIVEN ANY SUBSTANTIVE REPLY.  MFA SECGEN SEYDOU IN 
OCTOBER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR NOT TO ATTACH TOO MUCH 
IMPORTANCE TO THE MATTER.  WE NOTE THAT AT THE TIME OF 
THE VISIT, TEHRAN SPOKE OF \"IRAN\'S READINESS FOR 
COOPERATION WITH NIGER IN THE FIELDS OF AGRICULTURE, 
ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, DAM BUILDING, AND COMMERCE.\" (FBIS 
LONDON 301454Z JUN 97).  WHEN SEEKING THE MOTIVATION FOR 
NIGER\'S POLICIES ONE MUST ALWAYS CONSIDER THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT A SEARCH FOR ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE IS THE 
PRIMARY FACTOR.

LONG TERM TRENDS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) ALMOST ALL NIGERIENS WILL OPINE THAT 
FUNDAMENTALISM IS A LONG-TERM THREAT FOR NIGER. 
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT CLOISTERING OF WOMEN IN 
THE EASTERN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY THE 
ZINDER REGION, MAY BE ON THE INCREASE.  AS RECENTLY AS 
OCTOBER A GROUP OF EDUCATED, PROFESSIONAL NIGERIEN WOMEN 
TOLD THE AMBASSADOR AND THE PAO THAT ATTENDANCE AT 
ISLAMIC SCHOOLS WAS ON THE INCREASE BECAUSE MORE AND 
MORE PARENTS WANTED THEIR CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THE MORAL 
VALUES PRESENTED IN THE ISLAMIC SCHOOLS\' CURRICULA. 
(GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY INTERRUPTED BY 
TEACHERS\' STRIKES, SEEKING UNPAID WAGES.)  EDUCATED 
WOMEN IN PARTICULAR REGRET THE GROWING CONSERVATIVE 
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC AFFAIRS BECAUSE EFFORTS TO 
LEGISLATE A \"FAMILY CODE\" HAVE BEEN ON HOLD SINCE 1992 
OWING TO THE FIERCE OPPOSITION OF CONSERVATIVE, IF NOT 
FUNDAMENTALIST, MUSLIMS, SOME OF WHOM THREATENED 
VIOLENCE AGAINST ADVOCATES OF THE CODE.  THOUGH NIGER IS 
A SECULAR STATE, WOMEN DO NOT HAVE FULL EQUALITY WITH 
MEN BEFORE THE LAW IN CERTAIN AREAS, SUCN AS DIVORCE 
PROCEEDINGS AND INHERITANCE CASES.  THE FAMILY CODE 
WOULD HAVE ASSURED THIS EQUALITY. 
 
10.  (C) THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR TOLD AMBASSADOR CECIL 
THAT HIS FRENCH STAFF IS UNANIMOUS IN BELIEVING THAT 
IRAN IS WORKING COVERTLY IN NIGER TO PROMOTE SHI\'ISM. 
\"THEY HAVE MONEY AND ARE NOT IN A HURRY,\" SAID 
AMBASSADOR PAVEC.  \"IT IS NOT AN IMMINENT THREAT, BUT IN 
TEN YEARS, WHO KNOWS?\" 
 
11.  (C) WE CONCLUDE THAT BOTH IRAN AND RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA ARE WORKING TO PROMOTE 
SHI\'ISM IN NIGER.  THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A SLOW PROCESS 
BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE, IN GENERAL, OF STRONG RELIGIOUS 
BROTHERHOODS (\"TURUQ\", OR \"CONFRERIES\") IN NIGER, SUCH 
AS THE TIDJANI IN SENEGAL OR THE SANOUSSI IN LIBYA. 
THERE IS NO STRUCTURE THROUGH WHICH TO WORK TO INFLUENCE 
THOUSANDS OF BELIEVERS AT A TIME; IT\'S A TASK WHICH HAS 
TO BE ADVANCED MORE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  ONE NEED 
NOT BE A SHIA TO BE A FUNDAMENTALIST, HOWEVER.  THE TURN 
TOWARD RELIGION TO ASSUAGE FEELINGS OF DESPAIR AND 
HOPELESSNESS CAN EASILY BE PROMPTED BY POVERTY.  (WE 
NOTE THAT BOTH THE WORLD BANK AND THE UNDP HAVE LAUNCHED 
PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO COMBAT POVERTY.  THEY ARE NOT 
MOTIVATED, HOWEVER, BY A DESIRE TO RESIST ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM.)  IT MAY ONLY BE A SMALL STEP FROM SUCH 
DESPAIR TO ATTACKING GOVERNMENTS, OR EVEN DONORS, WHICH 
HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES INCAPABLE OF SOLVING THE ECONOMIC 
AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS AFFLICTING THE PEOPLE.  THE ANALYSIS 
OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER AMADOU, IN ITS SIMPLICITY, MAY 
WELL BE RIGHT ON TARGET.  BUT THE IRANIANS ARE HERE AS 
WELL, WORKING TO FORCE THE PACE A BIT.
