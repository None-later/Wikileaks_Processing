1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
:SUMMARY 
:------- 
 
2.  INDONESIAN NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF KUNARTO TOLD 
REPORTERS DEC. 28 THAT CAPTURED EAST TIMOR GUERRILLA 
LEADER JOSE \"XANANA\" GUSMAO WOULD BE TRIED ON A NUMBER OF 
CRIMINAL CHARGES; HE DID NOT MENTION ANY CHARGES UNDER 
THE ANTI-SUBVERSION LAW.  KUNARTO SAID THE TRIAL WOULD 
PROBABLY BE HELD IN DILI AND WOULD BEGIN IN JANUARY IF 
THE POLICE INVESTIGATION IS CONCLUDED ON SCHEDULE.  A 
HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER WITH THE INDONESIAN BAR ASSOCIATION 
(IKADIN) TOLD EMBOFF GUSMAO\'S WIFE HAD DESIGNATED THE 
INDONESIAN LEGAL AID INSTITUTE (LBH) TO DEFEND HER 
HUSBAND, BUT LBH HAD SO FAR BEEN UNABLE TO INFORM GU\"MAO 
OF THIS.  THE LAWYER FEELS KUNARTO\'S ANNOUNCEMENT 
PROBABLY REFLECTS THE OFFICIAL GOI DETERMINATION 
REGARDING CHARGES; WHEN HE VISITED POLICE HEADQUARTERS 
TWO WEEKS AGO, A DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO CHARGE 
GUSMAO WITH SUBVERSION WAS STILL PENDING.  END SUMMARY. 
 
POLICE CHIEF ANNOUNCES CHARGES 
:----------------------------- 
 
3.  CHIEF OF THE INDONESIAN NATIONAL POLICE (POLRI) GEN. 
(POL.) KUNARTO TOLD REPORTERS DEC. 28 THAT CAPTURED 
FRETILIN LEADER GUSMAO WOULD BE CHARGED UNDER THE 
INDONESIAN CRIMINAL CODE (KUHP).  ACCORDING TO PRESS 
REPORTS, KUNARTO SAID THE PRINCIPAL CHARGE AGAINST GUSMAO 
WOULD BE FILED UNDER CHAPTER 106 OF KUHP (CONSPIRACY TO 
PLACE ALL OR PART OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY UNDER THE 
CONTROL OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OR TO SEPARATE PART OF 
THE NATIONAL TERRITORY), WHICH REPORTEDLY CARRIES A 
MAXIMUM PENALTY OF LIFE IN PRISON.  SUBSIDIARY CHARGES 
WILL REPORTEDLY BE FILED UNDER CHAPTER 108 (ARMED 
OPPOSITION TO INDONESIAN AUTHORITY) AND CHAPTER 110 OF 
KUHP, AND UNDER EMERGENCY LAW NO. 12 OF 1951 (ILLEGAL 
STOCKPILING OF FIREARMS).  PRESS REPORTS DID NOT MENTION 
ANY REFERENCE BY KUNARTO TO CHARGES UNDER THE 
ANTI-SUBVERSION LAW OF 1963. 
 
4.  KUNARTO ALSO WAS QUOTED AS SAYING GUSMAO WOULD 
\"PROBABLY\" BE TRIED IN DILI, CONFIRMING EARLIER GOI 
STATEMENTS.  PROVIDED THE ONGOING POLICE INVESTIGATION OF 
GUSMAO IS CONCLUDED ON SCHEDULE, KUNARTO SAID, THE CASE 
SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO PROSECUTORS SHORTLY, AND THE 
TRIAL WOULD BEGIN IN JANUARY.  ASKED ABOUT PERMISSION TO 
INTERVIEW GUSMAO, KUNARTO TOLD JOURNALISTS NOT JUST 
ANYONE COULD MEET WITH THE FRETILIN LEADER, ADDING THERE 
WERE ALSO PROBLEMS WITH LANGUAGE. 
 
:HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS SEEK ACCESS 
:-------------------------------- 
 
5.  FRANS HENDRA WINARTA, A PROMINENT HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER 
WHO WAS PART OF THE IKADIN-LBH TEAM WHICH DEFENDED 
TIMORESE TRIED FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THE DEMONSTRATION WHICH 
PRECEDED THE KILLINGS IN DILI ON NOV. 12, 1991, AND A 
SUBSEQUENT PROTEST IN JAKARTA, TOLD EMBOFF A FAX FROM 
GUSMAO\'S WIFE IN AUSTRALIA HAD BEEN RECEIVED APPOINTING 
LBH TO DEFEND HER HUSBAND.  ON THE BASIS OF THIS FAX, 
WINARTA AND LAWYERS FROM LBH VISITED POLRI HEADQUARTERS 
TWO WEEKS AGO IN A VAIN ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO 
GUSMAO.  THEY WERE TOLD GUSMAO HAD ALREADY APPOINTED 
ANOTHER ATTORNEY TO DEFEND HIM.  (PRESS REPORTS HAVE 
MENTIONED SOEDJONO, A JAKARTA LAWYER, AS THE COUNSEL 
PURPORTEDLY CHOSEN BY GUSMAO.)  ACCORDING TO WINARTA, 
HOWEVER, LBH HAS RELIABLY CONFIRMED THAT GUSMAO HAS NOT 
YET APPOINTED DEFENSE COUNSEL. 
 
6.  WINARTA SAID HE WAS TOLD AT THE TIME OF HIS VISIT TO 
POLRI HEADQUARTERS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT YET 
DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT TO CHARGE GUSMAO WITH SUBVERSION. 
HE FEELS KUNARTO\'S STATEMENT AS REPORTED IN THE PRESS 
PROBABLY REFLECTS THE GOI\'S DECISION ON THE MATTER. 
WINARTA HAS HEARD GUSMAO WILL ALSO BE CHARGED WITH MURDER 
(CHAPTER 338 OF KUHP).  HE DESCRIBED THE APPARENT 
DECISION NOT TO FILE SUBVERSION CHARGES AS \"FUNNY,\" 
CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS IN DEMONSTRATIONS 
ALLEGEDLY \"MASTERMINDED\" BY GUSMAO WERE TRIED AND 
CONVICTED OF SUBVERSION EARLIER THIS YEAR.  HE SPECULATED 
THE GOI\'S DECISION WAS THE PRODUCT OF NEGOTIATIONS 
BETWEEN THE GOI AND ANOTHER PARTY OR PARTIES, POSSIBLY 
INCLUDING GUSMAO HIMSELF.  WINARTA SAID HE HOPES TO 
REPRESENT GUSMAO IN HIS TRIAL BUT ADMITS LANGUAGE COULD 
POSE DIFFICULTIES, SINCE HE SPEAKS NEITHER PORTUGUESE NOR 
TETUN. 
 
:COMMENT 
:------- 
 
7.  KUNARTO\'S ENUMERATION OF CHARGES AGAINST GUSMAO 
APPEARS TO CONFIRM REPORTS THE FRETILIN LEADER WOULD BE 
TRIED ONLY ON CRIMINAL CHARGES (REF C).  WINARTA\'S AND 
LBH\'S DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING ACCESS TO GUSMAO, AND THE 
APPARENT EFFORT TO DESIGNATE A DEFENSE COUNSEL FROM 
OUTSIDE THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITY, ARE REMINISCENT OF 
THE EARLY STAGES OF LAST SPRING\'S SUBVERSION TRIALS IN 
DILI.  WINARTA HAS PROMISED TO KEEP US UP-TO-DATE ON 
DEVELOPMENTS ON THIS FRONT, AND WE WILL CHECK IN WITH LBH 
WHEN ITS MEMBERS RETURN FROM VACATION ON JAN. 4.  END 
COMMENT.

E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR 
TAGS:  PREL, ID, MY 
SUBJECT:  SAM HUNTINGTON\'S \"CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS:\"  APOCALYPSE 
WHEN? 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  SAM HUNTINGTON\'S THESIS ABOUT THE \"COMING CLASH OF 
CIVILIZATIONS\" HAS CAUGHT ON IN ASIA LIKE WILDFIRE.  DEALING WITH 
THE ISSUE IS AS GREAT A CHALLENGE FOR POLICY AND PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
AS ANY IN THE POST COLD WAR ERA. WE NEED TO MOUNT A MAJOR EFFORT 
TO MEET THE CHALLENGE. END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  SAM HUNTINGTON\'S GHOST LURKED IN EVERY SHADOWY CORNER AT THE 
AUGUST 8-10 INDONESIA FORUM CONFERENCE ON ASIA-PACIFIC AND THE 
NEW WORLD ORDER.  AUSTRALIA\'S FOREIGN MINISTER GARETH EVANS 
PUBLICLY DEBUNKED HUNTINGTON\'S \"KULTURKAMPF\" HYPOTHESES BUT 
PRIVATELY CONFESSED THAT THEY WERE BECOMING AN IMPORTANT OBSTACLE 
TO KEATING\'S POLICY OF INTEGRATION WITH ASIA.  INDONESIAN 
SPEAKERS WARNED THAT THE RISE OF RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL TENSIONS 
WOULD TURN THEIR FRAGILE COUNTRY INTO THE NEXT YUGOSLAVIA. 
MALAYSIAN FINANCE MINISTER ANWAR IBRAHIM, HIS HAIR ON FIRE, USED 
HIS KEYNOTE SPEECH TO ASSERT THAT THE HUNTINGTON \"DOCTRINE\" 
REPRESENTED THE PREDOMINANT VIEW OF WESTERN INTELLECTUALS AND THE 
CENTRAL CORE OF U.S. POLICY.  HIS DIATRIBE GENERATED SPONTANEOUS 
APPLAUSE FROM INDONESIAN INTELLECTUALS, WHO SHEEPISHLY APOLOGIZED 
LATER. 
 
4.  THE \"CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS\" HAS MORE APPEAL THAN PREVIOUS 
\'BIG BANG\' THEORIES SUCH AS \"THE END OF HISTORY\" OR \"THE DECLINE 
OF THE WEST\" BECAUSE IT FITS BETTER INTO SOUND BITES OR BUMPER 
STICKERS, AND BECAUSE IT POSITS AN OVERARCHING CONFLICT AROUND 
WHICH THE \"BRAVE NEW WORLD\" WILL BE RESTRUCTURED. IT ALSO COMES 
ALONG AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN 
COMMUNISM TO FEAR.  WHILE HUNTINGTON HIMSELF PRESENTS HIS IDEAS 
AS NOTHING MORE THAN A SERIES OF WORST-CASE HYPOTHESES, THE 
DANGER IS THAT THE PROPHECY WILL BECOME SELF-FULFILLING AS MORE 
PEOPLE BELIEVE IT AND ACT ON IT.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN 
THE ISLAMIC WORLD, WHERE ANTI-WESTERN PARANOIA IS ALREADY AT A 
HIGH PITCH. DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE THUS CAN BECOME A CHALLENGE 
FOR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY - AND THE POLICIES UNDERPINNING IT - AS 
SERIOUS AS DEALING WITH THE COLD WAR CONCEPT OF PEACEFUL 
COEXISTENCE (OR, WHAT\'S MINE IS MINE AND YOURS IS NEGOTIABLE). 
 
5.  WE NEED A UNIFYING COUNTER-THEME AROUND WHICH WE CAN BUILD 
OUR RESPONSE.  GARETH EVANS HAS CHOSEN \"COMMUNITY AND 
CONVERGENCE,\" WHICH IS NOT BAD AS A GOAL BUT SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE 
THE TRIUMPH OF HOPE OVER REALITY.  \"GLOBAL INTEGRATION WITH 
RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY\" REQUIRES A LARGE BUMPER STICKER, BUT IS 
MORE PRESCRIPTIVE. E PLURIBUS UNUM DOES WELL AMONG LATIN 
SPEAKERS HERE, AS A FORERUNNER OF THE INDONESIAN NATIONAL MOTTO 
\"UNITY IN DIVERSITY\". 
 
6.  WHATEVER THE SLOGAN, WE THINK A MAJOR CAMPAIGN IS CALLED FOR 
TO COUNTER HUNTINGTONISM.  ED DJEREDJIAN\'S 1992 MERIDIAN HOUSE 
SPEECH PROVIDES USEFUL AMMUNITION, BUT IT NEEDS UPDATING AND 
INCREASED EMPHASIS ON WHAT WE ARE FOR RATHER THAN WHAT WE ARE 
AGAINST. ALSO,AS WE ARE LEARNING, THE PROBLEM EXTENDS WELL BEYOND 
THE MIDDLE EAST.  IN INDONESIA ALONE THERE ARE FAULT LINES 
BETWEEN HINDUS, CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS, SECULARISTS AND 
FUNDAMENTALISTS, NOT TO MENTION BETWEEN EAST AND WEST. WE WILL 
CERTAINLY CARRY THE ISSUE TO THE INDONESIAN MEDIA, BUT WE NEED 
MORE MATERIAL - STATEMENTS BY SENIOR OFFICIALS, WORLDNETS, VOA 
SPECIALS, AMPARTS - FULL SCALE EFFORTS WHICH USIA KNOWS HOW TO 
ORCHESTRATE SO WELL. 
 
7.  IN POLICY TERMS, OUR NEW FOCUS ON GLOBAL ISSUES MAY PROVIDE 
THE BEST SUBSTANTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR EMPHASIZING WHAT WE ARE FOR. 
OUR AGENDA OF NON-PROLIFERATION, COUNTER-TERRORISM, ARMS CONTROL, 
ENVIRONMENT, POPULATION, OPEN TRADING SYSTEMS, HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
POPULATION CONTROL CUTS ACROSS THE \"VELVET CURTAIN\" OF 
CIVILIZATION AND CULTURES.  WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE OUR 
ABILITY TO BUILD BROAD ISSUE-BASED COALITIONS IN INTERNATIONAL 
FORUMS RANGING FROM THE UNGA TO THE TROPICAL TIMBER 
ORGANIZATION.. 
 
8. SOMETIMES WE WILL NEED TO BUILD BRIDGES TO KEEP CHASMS FROM 
DEVELOPING ALONG HUNTINGTON\'S FAULT LINES. FOR EXAMPLE WE MAY ALL 
WONDER ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE NAM IN A MULTI-POLAR WORLD. BUT 
THE MOVEMENT EXISTS, AND IF WE WANT TO AVOID A RETURN TO THE 
RHETORICAL NORTH-SOUTH WARFARE OF THE 1970\'S, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO 
TURN OUR BACKS ON THE CURRENT MODERATE LEADERSHIP. WE SHOULD 
ENCOURAGE A NORTH-SOUTH DIALOG AND DEAL WITH ISSUES OF LEGITIMATE 
CONCERN TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD, AS PRESIDENT CLINTON DID IN HIS 
TOKYO BILATERAL WITH SOEHARTO IN JULY. OTHERWISE LEADERSHIP WILL 
GRAVITATE TO THE LIKES OF MALAYSIA\'S MAHATIR, WHO WILL USE THE 
FORUM TO DIVIDE RATHER THAN TO UNIFY. 
 
9. WE ALSO NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO LET CHASMS DEVELOP OVER 
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT HUMAN RIGHTS SHOULD 
BE LESS CENTRAL TO OUR POLICY, OR THAT WE SHOULD NOT PUSH THESE 
ISSUES VIGOROUSLY IN OUR BILATERAL DIALOGS. BUT WE NEED TO PAY 
CAREFUL ATTENTION TO OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR RELATIONS WITH 
COUNTRIES LIKE INDONESIA AND AVOID INDISCRIMINATE PUNITIVE 
MEASURES WHICH WILL REDUCE OUR LEVERAGE ON HUMAN RIGHTS WHILE 
ADDING FUEL TO THE KULTURKAMPF THEORIES. 
 
10. BECAUSE OF THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE MIDDLE EAST AND BOSNIA, THE 
ISSUE OF \"THE WEST VERSUS ISLAM\" HAS PARTICULAR RESONANCE NOW. 
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF JAKARTA, WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF 
EXPLAINING OUR ACTIONS, WHETHER THEY BE AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQI 
RADAR SITES,RETALIATORY ATTACKS ON AIDID\'S THUGS, OR OUR ACTIONS 
TO HALT SERB AND CROAT ATROCITIES IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA. WE 
ARE DOOMED TO PLAY CATCH UP ON THESE ISSUES GIVEN THE IMPACT OF 
INSTANT TV COVERAGE AND THE NEED FOR OPERATIONAL SECURITY, BUT WE 
THINK WE COULD DO BETTER AT EXPLAINING OUR ACTIONS TO FOREIGN 
AUDIENCES. 
 
11. WE ALSO NEED TO ORIENT SOME OF OUR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AWAY FROM 
A FOCUS ON CRISES SO THAT WE CAN PAY MORE ATTENTION TO OUR 
POSITIVE AGENDA OF THINGS WE AGREE ABOUT. FOR EXAMPLE, TO COUNTER 
THE \"WE VERSUS THEY\" MENTALITY, WE SHOULD MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT 
TO DESCRIBE OUR INTERACTION WITH THE OIC, OUR COOPERATIVE 
PROGRAMS WITH MUSLIM STATES, AND THE WAY IN WHICH MUSLIMS ARE 
INTEGRATED INTO AMERICAN SOCIETY. 
 
12. THESE CONSIDERATIONS HAVE NO DOUBT ALREADY OCCURED TO POLICY 
MAKERS IN WASHINGTON, BUT THE NEED FOR CONCERTED ACTION SEEMS 
PARTICULARLY URGENT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE HERE.

2.  (U) THE FOLLOWING FORMAT IS DERIVED FROM REFTEL AND 
RESPONDS TO PARAGRAPHING SET OUT IN PARA 3 REFTEL. 
 
A:  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM: 
 
THE GOI FACED A SERIOUS HOSTAGE TAKING IN IRIAN JAYA 
DURING 1996 WHICH INVOLVED THE KIDNAPPING OF THIRD 
COUNTRY AND INDONESIAN NATIONALS (NGO PERSONNEL, NONE 
DIPLOMATIC).  NO U.S. CITIZENS WERE INVOLVED. THE GOI 
WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE ICRC AND OTHERS TO SECURE THE 
HOSTAGES\' RELEASE THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.  WHEN THIS 
NEGOTIATED OUTCOME FAILED, GOI MILITARY WERE BROUGHT IN 
TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES.  ALL BUT TWO VICTIMS WERE 
RESCUED:  TWO OF THE INDONESIAN HOSTAGES WERE KILLED BY 
THEIR ABDUCTORS.  THE GOI HAS PURSUED THE KIDNAPPERS BUT 
HAS NOT CAPTURED ANY FOR PROSECUTION.  (SEE EXTENSIVE 
REPORTING ON THIS SUBJECT). 
 
THE GOI FACED A SIMILAR MASS KIDNAPPING CASE AGAIN IN 
IRIAN JAYA IN AUGUST WHICH INVOLVED ONLY INDONESIAN 
CITIZENS.  THE GOI TREATED THE MATTER AS A MILITARY 
PROBLEM AND PURSUED THE CAPTORS, COMPELLING THEM 
EVENTUALLY TO RELEASE ALL BUT TWO OF THE VICTIMS (THESE 
TWO REPORTEDLY HAVING BEEN TORTURED AND KILLED BY THEIR 
ABDUCTORS).  GOI MILITARY FORCES HAVE PURSUED THE 
KIDNAPPERS BUT HAVE NOT CAPTURED ANY FOR PROSECUTION. 
SEE POST REPORTING ON THIS SUBJECT. 
 
B.  GOI RESPONSE TO USG REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE IN 
TERRORIST CASES: 
 
THE GOI RESPONDED QUICKLY AND WITH FULL SUPPORT OVER A 
WEEKEND TO ASSIST IN GATHERING AND REVIEWING EVIDENCE IN 
ITS POSSESSION IN THE SHIROSAKI CASE.  THE RAPID GOI 
RESPONSE PROVIDED A BASIS FOR U.S. ACTION TO BRING THE 
SUSPECT TO THE U.S.   THE GOI IS CONTINUING TO WORK WITH 
THE USG ON THIS CASE. 
 
C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: 
 
THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND 
INDONESIA; HOWEVER, INDONESIA HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO 
U.S. REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE. 
 
D.  RESPONSE OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: 
 
SEE RESPONSE, PARA B. 
 
E.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1996: 
 
THE GOI HAS MAINTAINED ACTIVE MILITARY PURSUIT OF REBELS 
IN IRIAN JAYA WHO HAVE EMPLOYED TERRORIST TACTICS 
AGAINST INNOCENT CIVILIANS. 
 
F.  HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: 
 
THE GOI MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ALL STATES 
WHICH APPEAR ON THE \"TERRORISM LIST.\"  ALL OF THESE 
STATES MAINTAIN EMBASSIES IN INDONESIA. 
 
G. HOST GOVERNMENT STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST- 
SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE: 
 
NONE 
 
H. SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN GOI ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: 
 
NONE 
 
I.  U.S. REQUESTS FOR COOPERATION: 
 
THE U.S. SOUGHT THE COOPERATION OF THE GOI ON THE 
SHIROSAKI CASE, SPECIFICALLY ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE IN 
DETERMINING OVER A WEEKEND WHAT EVIDENCE WAS HELD BY THE 
GOI IN THE NINE YEAR OLD INCIDENT AND WHETHER THE GOI 
WOULD BE PREPARED TO ALLOW THE UNITED STATES USE OF THE 
EVIDENCE IT HAD IN A U.S. COURT.  THE GOI RESPONSE WAS 
ENTIRELY POSITIVE. 
 
J.  GOI COOPERATION OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS WITH U.S. 
REQUESTS: 
 
EMBASSY FILES ONLY EXTEND BACK TO 1995.  GOI AUTHORITIES 
HAVE CONSISTENTLY PLAYED AN EFFECTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE 
ROLE IN PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. 
CITIZENS.

SUBJECT:  INSIDE AN INDONESIAN PRISON WITH 
          FRETILIN LEADER XANANA GUSMAO 
 
REF:  JAKARTA 4875 
 
1.  CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS EDMUND MCWILLIAMS, REASON, 
1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY:  A WESTERN DIPLOMAT WAS ABLE TO ENTER 
CIPINANG PRISON, CLAIMING TO BE A RELATIVE OF A 
PRISONER, AND MET BRIEFLY WITH A NUMBER OF PROMINENT 
DISSIDENTS AND OTHER PRISONERS.  THE DIPLOMAT NOTED THAT 
THE PRISONERS APPEAR TO BE USING THEIR TIME TOGETHER TO 
SHARE POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES, NOT UNLIKE THE POLITICAL 
CROSS-POLLINATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN SOME OF THE LESS 
HARSH CAMPS IN THE SOVIET GULAG OR IN SOUTH AFRICA\'S 
ROBBEN ISLAND.  FRETILIN LEADER XANANA GUSMAO, A LEADING 
FIGURE WITHIN THE PRISONER COMMUNITY, TOLD THE DIPLOMAT 
THAT HIS VISION OF A FUTURE FOR EAST TIMOR INVOLVED A 
PERIOD OF AUTONOMY FOLLOWED BY A VOTE BY EAST TIMORESE 
ABOUT THEIR FUTURE.  END SUMMARY 
 
3.  (C) A WESTERN DIPLOMAT, POSING AS A RELATIVE OF A 
PRISONER IN JAKARTA\'S CIPINANG PRISON, USED THE OCCASION 
OF NATIONAL DAY VISITS AUGUST 17 TO ENTER THE PRISON. 
THE DIPLOMAT SOUGHT A MEETING WITH \"WILSON,\" ONE OF THE 
POLITICAL PRISONERS FROM THE PEOPLE\'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
(PRD) WHO WAS RECENTLY CONVICTED AND SENTENCED ON 
DISSENT CHARGES.  WITH MEETINGS BETWEEN PRISONERS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS TAKING PLACE IN A RELAXED 
ATMOSPHERE WITHIN A COURTYARD IN THE PRISON, THE 
DIPLOMAT WAS ABLE TO MEET AND SPEAK BRIEFLY WITH XANANA 
GUSMAO, IMPRISONED LEADER OF THE FRETILIN RESISTANCE 
FORCES OF EAST TIMOR. 
 
4.  (C) GUSMAO APPEARED IN GOOD HEALTH AND GOOD SPIRITS. 
GUSMAO HAS EMERGED AS A LEADER AMONG MANY PROMINENT 
POLITICAL DISSIDENTS WHO ARE INTERNED AT CIPINANG 
PRISON.  HE RECENTLY ORGANIZED A SOCCER MATCH BETWEEN A 
TEAM OF POLITICAL DISSIDENTS AND COMMON CRIMINALS (THE 
DISSIDENTS WON).  ACCORDING TO ACCOUNTS GIVEN TO THE 
DIPLOMAT, THE DISSIDENTS SPEAK JOKINGLY OF THE CIPINANG 
\"PARLIAMENT\" OR \"UNIVERSITY,\" ALLUDING TO THE BROAD 
POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE AMONG THE 
PRISONERS.  THE DIPLOMAT NOTED THAT STUDENTS VISIT SOME 
PRISONERS, SUCH AS IMPRISONED DISSIDENT SRI BINTANG 
PAMUNGKAS, TO LISTEN TO HIS INFORMAL LECTURES. 
 
5.  (C) GUSMAO, WHO IS LEARNING ENGLISH, AND OTHER 
PRISONERS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE BOOKS, PERIODICALS AND 
NEWSPAPERS AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SMUGGLE OUT LETTERS AND 
EVEN ARTICLES WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE.  THE PRISONERS 
DEPEND HEAVILY ON FOOD SENT BY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES 
INASMUCH AS PRISON FOOD IS SAID TO BE OF VERY POOR 
QUALITY. 
 
6.  (C) GUSMAO INDICATED TO THE DIPLOMAT THAT WHILE HE 
WOULD WELCOME A CHANCE TO RETURN HOME TO EAST TIMOR, HE 
IS OPPOSED TO THE NOTION THAT HE MIGHT BE RELEASED AND 
GO INTO EXILE.  GUSMAO REFUSED REQUESTS BY THE DIPLOMAT 
AND BY JOURNALISTS (ALSO PRESENT ON NATIONAL DAY) TO 
PROVIDE ANY READOUT ON HIS JULY 16 DINNER WITH NELSON 
MANDELA.  HE ALSO CLAIMED TO HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE UN SPONSORED EAST TIMOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN LISBON AND 
JAKARTA BUT EXPRESSED SOME HOPE FOR PROGRESS THROUGH 
THAT MECHANISM. 
 
7.  (C) GUSMAO DID SHARE HIS VIEWS WITH THE DIPLOMAT 
REGARDING A SOLUTION FOR EAST TIMOR.  HE SAID THAT HE 
BELIEVED THE SHAPE OF A FINAL SOLUTION WOULD INVOLVE 
SOME FORM OF AUTONOMY FOR FOUR TO FIVE YEARS AND THEN A 
VOTE BY THE PEOPLE OF EAST TIMOR ON THEIR FUTURE. 
 
8.  (C) COMMENT:  THE INTERACTION AMONG THE NON-CRIMINAL 
PRISONERS IS REMINISCENT OF ACCOUNTS OF LIFE IN SOME OF 
THE LESS HARSH PRISONS IN THE SOVIET GULAG OR ON ROBBEN 
ISLAND IN SOUTH AFRICA WHERE PRESIDENT MANDELA SPENT 
MUCH OF HIS LIFE.  AS IN CIPINANG THOSE CAMPS SAW A RICH 
CROSS POLLINATION OF POLITICAL IDEAS AND STRATEGIES 
AMONG PRISONERS.  WE NOTE AS WELL, THAT SEVERAL OF THE 
PRISONERS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT BEING MIXED WITH 
HARDENED CRIMINAL PRISONERS WHO OFTEN FUNCTIONED AS 
SPIES FOR THE PRISON ADMINISTRATION.  TYPICALLY, ONE 
CRIMINAL IS PLACED WITH THREE POLITICAL PRISONERS IN 
FOUR-PERSON CELLS.  XANANA REPORTEDLY HAS A PRIVATE 
CELL.

PAKSI\" AND OTHERS).   THE GOI POLICE/MILITARY AND 
JUDICIAL SYSTEM HAS SOUGHT TO APPREHEND AND PROSECUTE 
ANTI-INTEGRATIONIST ELEMENTS ACCUSED OF ATTACKS ON NON- 
COMBATANTS (AND COMBATANTS).  IT CURRENTLY HAS DETAINED 
AND IS PREPARING CASES AGAINST TWO PERSONS WHOM IT HAS 
ALLEGED ARE TERRORISTS BECAUSE OF THEIR ATTEMPTS TO 
SMUGGLE MUNITIONS INTO EAST TIMOR.  THE GOI IS SEEKING 
THE SURRENDER FROM REFUGE IN THE AUSTRIAN EMBASSY OF TWO

AND EVIDENCE INVOLVED IN U.S. PROSECUTION OF THE ALLEGED 
PERPETRATOR OF A 1986 ATTACK ON THE U.S. EMBASSY IN 
JAKARTA.  THIS COOPERATION, WHICH BEGAN IN 1996, HAS

CONVICTED IN U.S. FEDERAL COURT IN NOVEMBER, 1997.) 
 
C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7.  (S) DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF A FORMAL EXTRADITION 
TREATY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND INDONESIA, AND SOME 
CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO EXTRADITION CONTAINED IN 
INDONESIAN LAW, THE GOI HAS COOPERATED WITH THE UNITED 
STATES IN SUPPORT OF PROSECUTION OF A RECENT COURT CASE 
(PARA 6).  (NOTE: THE QUESTION OF EXTRADITION OF THE 
ACCUSED FROM INDONESIAN TERRITORY DID NOT ARISE IN THAT 
CASE AS THE ACCUSED WAS ARRESTED OUTSIDE OF INDONESIA.

--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8.  (C) INDONESIA, WHICH HAS SIGNED FOUR OF THE 10 KEY

G.  GOI PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST- 
SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE: 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
11.  (U) THE GOI OCCASIONALLY IS CRITICAL OF SANCTIONS

SUBJECT:  XANANA GUSMAO LETTER TO THE SECRETARY 
 
REF: A) STATE 47684, B) JAKARTA 1413 
 
1.  CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE MICHAEL P. OWENS, REASON, 1.5 
(B) AND (D). 
 
2. FOLLOWING IS A LETTER FROM EAST TIMORESE RESISTANCE 
LEADER XANANA GUSMAO TO THE SECRETARY, IN RESPONSE TO 
THE SECRETARY\'S LETTER OF MARCH 19 (REF A).  THE 
ORIGINAL IS BEING FORWARDED BY POUCH: 
 
SALEMBA, MARCH 22, 1999 
 
SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE 
2201 C STREET, NW 
WASHINGTON, DC 20520 
 
DEAR MADAME SECRETARY, 
 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER OF MARCH 19.  YOUR WORDS ARE 
OF GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT AND CERTAINLY REINFORCE OUR 
COMMITMENT FOR PEACE IN EAST TIMOR AS OUR HUMBLE 
CONTRIBUTION TO A STABLE AND PEACEFUL SOUTHEAST ASIA. 
 
I WILL RECALL OUR MEETING AS A MEMORABLE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SHARE A MOMENT OF FREEDOM WITH SOMEONE WHO SO CLEARLY 
UNDERSTANDS ITS MEANING.  IT WAS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
VOICE THE YEARNINGS OF MY PEOPLE FOR PEACE AND 
RECONCILIATION AND, ABOVE ALL, PEACE OF MIND TO SECURE 
A FREE AND DIGNIFIED LIFE FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN. 
 
I ALSO WISH TO EXPRESS OUR INTEREST IN STAYING IN CLOSE 
AND REGULAR TOUCH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND 
AMBASSADOR J. STAPLETON ROY.  MY PERSONAL ASSISTANT, 
MS. KIRSTY SWORD, WILL ENSURE THE CONTACT BETWEEN 
THE US EMBASSY IN JAKARTA AND MY OFFICE. 
 
REPORTS FROM EAST TIMOR ARE UNFORTUNATELY DEPICTING AN 
ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AS WELL AS AN 
INCREASE OF ARMED MILITIAS GROUPS (NAMELY IN LOSPALOS 
AND SAME). 
 
THE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS IS FACING NEW 
SETBACKS AFTER THE EXPOSURE OF THE POLITICAL MANEUVERING 
BY GOVERNOR ABILIO OSORIO SOARES AND MR. GIL ALVES, 
PRESIDENT OF KLIBUR.  THE DOCUMENT, WHICH REVEALED THEIR 
INSINCERE INTENTIONS IN THE RECONCILIATION DIALOGUE ALSO 
PROVES ABRI (THE INDONESIAN MILITARY) AND DEPLU (THE 
DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS) BACK THEIR ACTION AND 
STRATEGY. 
 
THEY RECENTLYHELD A MEETING WITH A GROUP OF TEN 
INDONESIAN GENERALS IN WHICH SEVEN STATED THEY WOULD 
RESPECT A DECISION TAKEN BY THE PEOPLE OF EAST TIMOR 
WHILE THREE, INCLUDING MR. ZACHY ANWAR (FORMER HEAD 
OF BIA)(MILITARY INTELLIGENCE), SUPPORT THE ONGOING WAR 
AGAINST DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS. 
 
WE INSIST THAT THE TWO CATHOLIC BISHOPS, MONS. XIMENES 
BELO AND MONS. BASILIO DO NASCIMENTO, LEAD THE PEACE AND 
RECONCILIATION PROCESS.  NO ONE ELSE GATHERS SIMILAR 
CONSENSUS, POLITICAL CREDIBILITY AND LEGITIMACY.  WE 
ARE ALSO SUPPORTING THE EFFORTS CARRIED OUT BY KOMNASHAM 
(THE NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION) TO FACILITATE 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE EAST TIMORESE, TO SET UP A BROAD- 
BASED PEACE AND STABILITY COUNCIL. 
 
WE SUPPORT THE TWO CATHOLIC BISHOPS\' STANCE ON 
DEVELOPING THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS IN DILI RATHER 
THAN JAKARTA AND URGE THAT PRESSURE BE EXERTED UPON 
JAKARTA TO ENABLE MY PRESENCE IN DILI TO PARTICIPATE 
IN A FUTURE MEETING CONVENED BY THE BISHOPS. 
 
WE INSIST ON THE NEED TO DISARM AND DISBAND THE ARMED 
MILITIA GROUPS.  WE ARE AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTIES THIS 
WILL RAISE GIVEN THE SPONSORSHIP AND SUPPORT GRANTED BY 
JAKATA AND ABRI.  UNFORTUNATELY SUCH A SITUATION HAS 
FORCED ME TO SHIFT MY CALL FOR A UN POLICE FORCE TO A 
UN PEACE KEEPING FORCE.  THE ACTION CARRIED OUT BY THESE 
GROUPS IS NOT WARFARE AGAINST AN ARMED COUNTERPART.  IT 
IS COLD-BLOODED MURDER AGAINST DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS, 
SUCH AS THE MALIANA KILLINGS TWO DAYS AGO, WHERE TWO 
ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN WERE SHOT. 
 
WE FULLY AGREE WITH AND HIGHLY APPRECIATE THE POINTS 
YOU RAISED AS ON-GOING EFFORTS TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF 
VIOLENCE IN THE TERRITORY.  WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO USE 
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR DEEPEST GRATITUDE AND 
ADMIRATION FOR YOUR WORDS AND SPEECH \"INDONESIA, THE 
UNITED STATES AND DEMOCRACY,\" ADDRESSED IN JAKARTA 
BEFORE LEAVING INDONESIA.  WE AGREE THAT ONLY AN 
IMMEDIATE REDUCTION OF ABRI\'S PRESENCE IN EAST TIMOR 
WILL ENABLE ITS FUTURE PARTICIPATION IN A UN PEACE 
KEEPING FORCE AND THAT ONLY A DEMOCRATIC AND CREDIBLE 
MECHANISM TO DETERMINE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WILL 
LAST AND SUCCEED. 
 
WE ARE CERTAIN THAT WITH YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND 
COMMITMENT TO PEACE IN EAST TIMOR IT WILL BECOME A 
REALITY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  WE PLEDGE OUR COMMITMENT TO 
ENSURE THAT THE FREEDOM OF EAST TIMOR AND THE BIRTH OF 
OUR NEW NATION WILL BE YET ANOTHER FIRM STEP IN THE 
DIRECTION OF PEACE AND COOPERATION IN THIS TROUBLED 
REGION OF THE WORLD. 

 
SINCERELY 
KAY RALA XANANA GUSMAO 
 
3.  COMMENT: IN OUR VIEW, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POINTS IN 
XANANA\'S LETTER ARE: 
 
-- AN INSISTENCE THAT THE TWO BISHOPS TAKE THE LEAD IN 
RECONCILIATION EFFORTS (WHICH CONFIRMS EARLIER REPORTS - 
REF B), AND HIS DESIRE TO ATTEND ANY RESULTING CHURCH- 
SPONSORED FORUM IN EAST TIMOR. 
 
-- HIS REITERATION OF SUPPORT FOR KOMNASHAM\'S PROPOSED 
PEACE AND STABILITY COUNCIL.  (OTHERS ON THE PRO- 
INDEPENDENCE SIDE ARE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A 
KOMNASHAM ROLE.) 
 
-- A CALL FOR A UN PEACEKEEPING FORCE.  XANANA 
PREVIOUSLY HAD EXPRESSED PREFERENCE FOR A RELATIVELY 
SMALL UN POLICE CONTINGENT. 
 
-- HIS CALL FOR A REDUCED ABRI PRESENCE.  UNLIKE SOME ON 
THE PRO-INDEPENDENCE SIDE, XANANA STOPS SHORT OF 
DEMANDING A TOTAL ABRI WITHDRAWAL BEFORE THE VOTING 
PROCESS AND EVEN SUGGESTS THAT ABRI COULD BE PART OF A 
\"PEACEKEEPING FORCE.\" 
 
4.   XANANA\'S UNCHARACTERISTICALLY UNDIPLOMATIC DIATRIBE 
AGAINST GOVERNOR ABILIO SOARES AND SOARES\' BROTHER-IN- 
LAW GIL ALVES STEMS FROM HIS BELIEF THAT HE WAS DECEIVED 
ABOUT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE LATTER\'S \"RECONCILIATION 
DIALOGUE,\" WHICH WAS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE MARCH 19-20 IN 
JAKARTA (REF B).  XANANA APPARENTLY HAD AGREED TO ATTEND 
THE MEETING AFTER BEING GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS 
WAS AN ATTEMPT TO START A DIALOGUE BETWEEN PRO AND ANTI- 
INDEPENDENCE FORCES.  HE SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED THAT 
SOARES AND ALVES, IN A FUNDING REQUEST TO THE DEPARTMENT 
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, HAD PORTRAYED THE FORUM\'S PURPOSE AS 
PROMOTING THE AUTONOMY OPTION.  THERE CURRENTLY IS A 
SEEMINGLY UNBRIDGEABLE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE PRO AND ANTI- 
INDEPENDENCE FORCES IN REGARD TO THE CONCEPT OF 
\"RECONCILIATION.\"  XANANA\'S SIDE SEES RECONCILIATION AS 
CONVINCING THE PRO-INTEGRATION FORCES TO ACCOMMODATE 
THEMSELVES TO THE REALITY OF INEVITABLE INDEPENDENCE, 
WHILE THE PRO-INTEGRATIONISTS DEFINE IT AS LEADING TO A 
COMPROMISE SOLUTION BETWEEN OUTRIGHT INDEPENDENCE AND 
THE STATUS QUO, I.E., AUTONOMY.  XANANA\'S CRITICISM OF 
ZACHY ANWAR IS IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS INDICATIONS THAT 
ZACHY (WHO HAS MET WITH XANANA ON AT LEAST TWO 
OCCASIONS) HAD ESTABLISHED A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 
XANANA AND WAS PLAYING A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN PROMOTING 
RECONCILIATION EFFORTS.

SUBJECT: XANANA GUSMAO TO BE RELEASED SEPTEMBER 7 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMB. J. STAPLETON ROY; REASON 1.5(D). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY. THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT PLANS TO RELEASE XANANA 
GUSMAO ON TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7. ALTHOUGH THE INDONESIAN PLAN IS 
TO RETURN HIM TO EAST TIMOR ON THAT DAY, THE BRITISH (AND WE) 
CONSIDER THAT COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND ARE SEEKING TO ARRANGE 
HIS RELEASE IN JAKARTA, WHERE HE WILL BE HOUSED WITH THE BRITISH 
AMBASSADOR. WHAT WILL BE POSSIBLE WILL BE DETERMINED IN MEETINGS 
LATER ON SEPTEMBER 6. END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) ON THE AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 6, I MET WITH THE UK 
AMBASSADOR, THE PORTUGUESE REPRESENTATIVE, AND A MEMBER OF 
XANANA GUSMAO\'S STAFF TO DISCUSS ARRANGEMENTS FOR XANANA 
GUSMAO\'S RELEASE. THE DISCUSSION REVEALED THE FOLLOWING. JUSTICE 
MINISTER MULADI TELEPHONED XANANA GUSMAO LATE SEPTEMBER 5 AND 
INFORMED HIM THAT HIS RELEASE ORDER WOULD BE SIGNED ON 
SEPTEMBER 6, AND HE WOULD BE SENT BY PLANE TO EAST TIMOR ON 
SEPTEMBER 7 TO BE TURNED OVER TO UNAMET. XANANA TURNED DOWN 
THESE ARRANGEMENTS, NOTING THAT HIS PURPOSE IN GOING TO EAST 
TIMOR WOULD BE TO MEET WITH HIS PEOPLE, WHICH WOULD BE 
IMPOSSIBLE UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. WE ALL AGREED IT WOULD 
BE INCONCEIVABLE TO SEND XANANA TO EAST TIMOR UNDER CURRENT 
CIRCUMSTANCES THERE, AND IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HEAD THIS OFF. 
 
4. (C) THE UK AMBASSADOR HAD AGREED TO OFFER HOSPITALITY TO 
XANANA AT HIS RESIDENCE, WHERE HE WOULD BE MORE SECURE. IT WAS 
NOT KNOWN YET WHETHER THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD AGREE TO 
XANANA\'S RELEASE IN JAKARTA. XANANA AND HIS LAWYER WERE 
SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH MULADI IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF 
SEPTEMBER 6, WHERE IT WAS HOPED THIS COULD BE CLARIFIED. (I 
LATER LEARNED THAT UNAMET JAKARTA REPRESENTATIVE TAMRAT SAMUEL 
JOINED THIS MEETING). UK MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
JOHN BATTLE IS ARRIVING IN JAKARTA THIS EVENING (SEPT 6) AND THE 
UK AMBASSADOR PLANNED TO TAKE HIM IMMEDIATELY TO CALL ON XANANA 
AT 10 P.M. THE BRITISH HOPED TO GET PERMISSION FOR XANANA TO BE 
RELEASED THE SAME EVENING SO HE COULD SPEND THE NIGHT AT THE 
BRITISH RESIDENCE (BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT HIS SECURITY AT HIS 
PRESENT LOCATION). 
 
5. (C) IF IT TRANSPIRED THAT THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT 
AGREE TO XANANA\'S RELEASE IN JAKARTA (WHETHER TONIGHT OR 
TOMORROW), THE UK AMBASSADOR (OR BATTLE) WOULD TELEPHONE FOREIGN 
MINISTER ALATAS AND INDICATE THAT THE BRITISH WOULD IMMEDIATELY 
MAKE PUBLIC THE FACT OF THEIR OFFER. FOREIGN SECRETARY ROBIN 
COOK HAD APPROVED THIS GAME PLAN. 
 
6. (C) AMBASSADOR JAMSHEED MARKER SUBSEQUENTLY INDICATED THAT IF 
IT APPEARED THAT THE INDONESIANS WERE INSISTENT ON RETURNING 
XANANA TO EAST TIMOR, HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY ASK THE UN SECRETARY 
GENERAL TO TELEPHONE HABIBIE TO TRY TO PREVENT THIS. HE 
AUTHORIZED THE UK AMBASSADOR TO INFORM ALATAS OF THIS IF 
NECESSARY. 
 
7. (C) AMBASSADOR MARKER INDICATED THAT PRESIDENT HABIBIE HAD 
INFORMED HIM OF HIS PLAN TO RELEASE XANANA AND TURN HIM OVER TO 
UNAMET IN BAUCAU ON SEPTEMBER 7 OR 8. MARKER TOLD THE PRESIDENT 
THAT UNAMET WAS NOT WILLING TO PLAY THIS ROLE SINCE IT COULD 
HARDLY INSURE XANANA\'S SECURITY WHEN IT COULD NOT ASSURE ITS OWN 
SECURITY UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES. HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT 
WHEN XANANA WAS RELEASED, HE SHOULD BE FREE TO GO WHERE HE 
CHOSE. THE PRESIDENT HAD INDICATED THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT 
COULD BE DISCUSSED (THIS LED TO TAMRAT SAMUEL\'S PARTICIPATION IN 
THE MEETING WITH MULADI).

3.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR CONVEYED THE U.S. DESIRE TO SUPPORT 
THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF INDONESIA, TO HELP BUILD

EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF SOLVING THE WEST TIMOR

GUS DUR MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT 
---------------------------------- 
5.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED SUDARSONO AS 
INDONESIA\'S FIRST CIVILIAN MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND SECURITY 
IN OVER 40 YEARS AND ANNOUNCED WITH PLEASURE THAT 
PRESIDENT CLINTON WOULD MEET WITH PRESIDENT WAHID ON 
FRIDAY IN WASHINGTON DC, DESPITE AN EXTREMELY TIGHT 
SCHEDULE AND ONGOING BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESS.  PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS MADE 
TIME TO SEE PRESIDENT WAHID BECAUSE THE U.S. VIEWS GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH THE NEW INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT TO BE 
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT, HE SAID. 
 
STRONG COMMITMENT TO MILITARY REFORMS 
------------------------------------- 
6.  (C)  MINISTER SUDARSONO SAID HE IS FULLY COMMITTED TO 
MILITARY REFORMS.  AS THE FIRST CIVILIAN DEFENSE MINISTER 
SINCE 1947, HE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE \"SYMBOLIZES A 
NEW BEGINNING,\" MAKING IT THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT 
HE  \"TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS.\"  HE OUTLINED THE MANY 
CHALLENGES FACING THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN DEVELOPING THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        JAKART  05612  01 OF 04  101034Z 
VIABLE INSTITUTIONS IN THE INDONESIAN SOCIETY THAT WILL 
SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN GRADUAL DEMOCRATIZATION AND ENABLE 
THE INDONESIAN ARMED FORCES TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE 
POLITICAL ROLE TNI HAD PLAYED FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS TO 
BECOME A MORE PROFESSIONAL FORCE.  HE SAID THE CURRENT 
PROBLEMS OF THE MILITARY ARE NOT TOTALLY TNI\'S FAULT SINCE 
THE ARMED FORCES WERE MISUSED BY THE CIVILIAN 
GOVERNMENT IN THE PAST.  THE ARMY IS NOW ACCEPTING ITS 
NEW ROLE IN A MORE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, HE SAID. 
 
7.  (C)  MINISTER SUDARSONO EMPHASIZED THE SEVERE IMPACT OF 
THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT CAUSED GDP PER CAPITIA IN 
INDONESIA TO PLUMMET FROM USD 1300 IN EARLY 1997 TO ABOUT 
USD 600 PRESENTLY.  THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS AND POOR HAVE 
BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD HIT, HE SAID.  THAT IS WHY THERE HAS 
BEEN SO MUCH SOCIAL UNREST AND VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY; 
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND HOPE.  THE 
RESULTANT SECURITY PROBLEMS HAVE MADE TNI\'S ROLE MORE 
DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED INTERNAL MILITARY REFORMS. 
SUDARSONO SAID THE ARMED FORCES FIRST NEED TO DEVELOP 
THE RIGHT DOCTRINE, THEN PROCEED WITH MEASURED STEPS TO 
REFORM THE MILITARY INSTITUTION. 
 
8.  (C)  SUDARSONO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT \"THE 
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL MARKET ECONOMICS,\" 
THAT CAN HAVE A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON CERTAIN PARTS OF 
SOCIETY IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES LIKE INDONESIA.  THIS IS 
ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THOSE WITHOUT THE REQUISITE SKILLS TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE, HE SAID. 
 
OUR GOAL IS TO HELP INDONESIA SUCCEED 
------------------------------------- 
9.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD SUDARSONO THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE WAHID GOVERNMENT.  THE 
ELECTIONS WERE A \"TRIUMPH FOR DEMOCRACY\" AND HE HAD 
PERSONALLY BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE NEW PRESIDENT\'S VISION 
FOR THE COUNTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR CONVEYED THE U.S. DESIRE 
TO SUPPORT THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF INDONESIA, TO HELP 
BUILD STRONG DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND TO HELP 
INDONESIA DEVELOP AN OPEN, MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMY.  THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST OF THE U.S. IS A STRONG, UNITED 
INDONESIA TO SERVE AS AN ANCHOR OF STABILITY FOR THE 
SOUTHEAST ASIAN REGION.  INSTABILITY IN INDONESIA WOULD 
CAUSE PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT ASIA, HE SAID.  IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH INDONESIA\'S WANTS AND DESIRES, THE AMBASSADOR SAID 
THE U.S., AS THE OLDEST DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD, IS PREPARED 
TO OFFER EXPERT ASSISTANCE WITH ISSUES OF DEMOCRATIC 
TRANSITION AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION, RESTRUCTURING OF THE 
JUSTICE SECTOR AND ECONOMIC REFORMS, IN ADDITION TO CIVIL- 
MILITARY RELATIONS AND MILITARY REFORMS.  OUR GOAL IS TO 
HELP INDONESIA SUCCEED, HE SAID. 
 
DESIRE FOR IMPROVED BILATERAL MILITARY RELATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
10.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED HIS STRONG DESIRE TO GET 
BACK TO A NORMAL MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WITH INDONESIA. HE 
SAID THE U.S. LOOKS FORWARD TO HAVING SUDARSONO VISIT 
WASHINGTON AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO MEET WITH 
SECRETARY COHEN AND PERHAPS SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS; 
CINCPAC ADMIRAL BLAIR ALSO LOOKS FORWARD TO MEETING HIM 
AND ADMIRAL WIDODO, HE SAID.  MINISTER SUDARSONO SAID 
THAT BILATERAL MILITARY RELATIONS CURRENTLY IS THE MOST 
CRUCIAL AREA OF INDONESIA-U.S. RELATIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR 
EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPEDITING WEST TIMOR 
REFUGEE RETURNS AS AN ACTION THAT WOULD HELP OPEN THE 
DOOR TO CLOSER DEFENSE COOPERATION. 
 
GOALS AND VISION FOR MILITARY REFORMS 
------------------------------------- 
11.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY ON GOALS 
AND VISION FOR MILITARY REFORMS, MINISTER SUDARSONO SAID 
THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS TO REVISE THE LONG-TERM 
DEFENSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  AGAIN, SUDARSONO SAID IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO QUICKLY RESTORE BILATERAL MILITARY 
RELATIONS, ESPECIALLY IMET (THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL MILITARY 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAM).  SUDARSONO SAID HE 
WOULD LIKE TO SEND A CORE GROUP OF 15 TO 20 OF TNI\'S BEST 
AND BRIGHTEST OFFICERS FROM ALL THREE SERVICES (INCLUDING 
JUNIOR, MID-GRADE AND SENIOR OFFICERS FROM EACH SERVICE) 
TO THE U.S. FOR IMET TRAINING.  THIS \"HORIZONTALLY 
INTEGRATED\" GROUP OF OFFICERS WOULD BE KEPT TOGETHER FOR 
THE NEXT 10 TO 15 YEARS AND EMPLOYED IN LONG TERM 
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MILITARY REFORMS, HE SAID. 
 
12.  (C)  CONTINUING, SUDARSONO SAID THAT INDONESIA MUST 
DEVELOP COLLABORATIVE AND AFFORDABLE MUTUAL SECURITY 
ARRANGEMENTS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS (SPECIFICALLY MENTIONING 
SINGAPORE AND AUSTRALIA).  \"OUR BIG PROBLEM IS MONEY,\" HE 
SAID.  IT WILL BE HARD TO CONVINCE THE NEW LEGISLATURE TO 
GIVE THE DEFENSE MINISTRY MORE MONEY UNDER CURRENT 
CONSTRAINED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. 
 
WEST TIMOR REFUGEE RETURNS A TOP PRIORITY 
---------------------------------------- 
13.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR PROVIDED IMPRESSIONS FROM HIS 
RECENT VISIT TO WEST AND EAST TIMOR.  HE HAD BEEN 
IMPRESSED, HE SAID, BY THE SINCERITY OF WEST TIMOR 
GOVERNOR PIET TALLO AND OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN 
THEIR DESIRE TO RESOLVE THE REFUGEE PROBLEM IN WEST TIMOR. 
OFFICIALS IN WEST TIMOR ARE POSITIVELY MOTIVATED AND THE 
U.S. GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE 
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE IN WEST TIMOR, AS WELL AS EAST TIMOR, 
HE SAID.  HOWEVER THE REFUGEES MUST BE GIVEN A FREE CHOICE. 
THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS WITH MILITIA MEMBERS IN THE 
REFUGEE CAMPS PREVENTING THE FREE MOVEMENT OF THOSE 
WHO WISH TO RETURN.  THE MILITIAS ARE UNDERMINING THE 
GOVERNOR\'S AUTHORITY, THE AMBASSADOR SAID.  THIS IS A 
PROBLEM BECAUSE EAST TIMOR IS STILL GETTING IN THE WAY OF 
THE STRATEGIC ISSUE - THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S 
ABILITY TO SUPPORT INDONESIA IN THIS NEW MORE DEMOCRATIC 
PHASE OF THE NATION\'S HISTORY.  IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE 
REFUGEE ISSUE BE SOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL TO GAIN THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT IN JAKARTA THE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT IT 
DESERVES.  MINISTER JUWONO RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THIS 
MESSAGE AND PROMISED TO WORK TOWARD THIS GOAL. 
 
NEED FOR LIAISON BETWEEN TNI AND INTERFET 
----------------------------------------- 
14.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED FOR MINISTER SUDARSONO\'S 
ASSISTANCE IN ESTABLISHING FORMAL LIAISON BETWEEN 
INTERFET AND TNI TO ADDRESS BORDER ISSUES AND ASSIST WITH 
OVERLAND RETURN OF REFUGEES.  INTERFET COMMANDER MG 
COSGROVE HAS ACTIVEY SOUGHT, BUT SO FAR HAS BEEN UNABLE 
TO SET UP ANY FORMAL COORDINATION PROCESS ON BORDER 
ISSUES WITH TNI.  SUCH A LIAISON ARRANGEMENT IS CRITICALLY 
IMPORTANT TO LOWER TENSIONS, PROMOTE MUTUAL 
UNDERSTANDING, TO FACILITATE MOVEMENTOF REFUGEES BACK 
ACROSS THE BORDER INTO EAST QIMOR, AND AVOID ANY FURTHER 
UNFORTUNATE BORDEQ INCIDENTS BETWEEN INTERFET AND 
INDONESIAN SECRITY FORCES.  THE U.S. STRONGLY SUPPORTS 
SUCHCOOPERATION.  EXISTING \"AD HOC\" COMMUNICATIONS ARE 
SIMPLY NOT ADEQUATE TO FACILITATE THE FLOW OF PEOPLE AND 
COMMERCE ACROSS THE BORDER.  WITH HEAVY RAINS ALREADY 
STARTED, A BROAD CONFIDENCE BUILDING MECHANISM IS 
URGENTLY NEEDED TO FACILITATE REFUGEE RETURNS, HE SAID. 
 
15.  (C)  IN RESPONSE TO MINISTER SUDARSONO\'S SUGGESTION 
THAT THE ISSUE BE TAKEN UP WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE 
AMBASSADOR EMPHATICALLY REMONSTRATED THAT THE 
PROBLEM IS ON THE GROUND.  IT IS TOTALLY NECESSARY TO HAVE 
PROVISIONS FOR DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN SECURITY 
FORCES TO LOWER TENSIONS AND AVOID FURTHER ACCIDENTS. 
SUDARSONO AGREED THAT A PARALLEL DIPLOMATIC AND 
PRAGMATIC APPROACH IS NEEDED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND 
PROMISED TO HELP. 
 
MILITIA STATUS 
-------------- 
16.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE, 
EAST TIMOR WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CLOSE AND POSITIVE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS BIG NEIGHBOR, INDONESIA, AND SAID IT IS 
FORTUNATE THAT XANANA GUSMAO IS A MODERATE AND 
REASONABLE PERSON.  MINISTER SUDARSONO AGREED THAT IT 
WAS A GOOD THING THAT XANANA WAS TREATED WELL DURING 
HIS DETENTION IN JAKARTA.  \"XANANA STILL HAS MANY FRIENDS 
HERE,\" HE SAID.  SUDARSONO SAID IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF 
XANANA WOULD SEND MORE SIGNALS OF RECONCILIATION TO 
THOSE PRO-INTEGRATION SUPPORTERS REMAINING IN WEST TIMOR. 
THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THOSE MILITIA 
MEMBERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO RETURN TO EAST TIMOR TO 
LEAVE WEST TIMOR AND SETTLE ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY 
WITH GOVERNMENT HELP.  HOWEVER, MANY WOULD LIKE TO 
RETURN IF THEIR SAFETY COULD BE GUARANTEED.  THEY WOULD 
PREFER TO WAIT IN WEST TIMOR AND MANY HAVE REFUSED TO 
LEAVE THE ISLAND, HE SAID. 
 
CONCERN OVER AN INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
17.  (C)  MINISTER SUDARSONO SAID THAT THE SYMBOLISM OF THE 
HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN WEST AND EAST TIMOR MATCHES GUS 
DUR\'S RECONCILIATORY PHILOSOPHY AND VISION.  AT THE SAME 
TIME, SUDARSONO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY (COI) THAT WILL 
INVESTIGATE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN EAST TIMOR.  THE 
AMBASSADOR SAID THAT IT IS FORTUNATE MARZUKI DARUSMAN, 
THE NEW INDONESIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HEAD OF THE 
NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION (KOMNAS HAM), HAS 
EXCELLENT CREDIBILITY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
A CREDIBLE KOMNAS HAM INVESTIGATION WITH THE FULL 
COOPERATION OF THE INDONESIAN MILITARY WOULD DIMINISH 
THE PRESSURE FOR INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT, HE SAID. 
HOWEVER, THE AMBASSADOR ADDED, THE HEAD OF THE COI, 
SONIA PICADO, A PERSONAL FRIEND AND A TRUE PROFESSIONAL, 
WOULD TAKE A REASONABLE, LOW KEY APPROACH TO THE 
INVESTIGATION WITHOUT RESORTING TO A MEDIA CIRCUS. 
KOMNAS HAM SHOULD WORK QUIETLY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 
COI AND AVOID PUBLIC CONFRONTATION, HE SAID. 
 
18.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED SEVERAL ISSUES IN 
CLOSING.  HE SAID AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE PLANS TO VISIT 
JAKARTA ON 19 OR 20 NOVEMBER AND WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO 
MEET SUDARSONO AND OTHER KEY MINISTERS.  THE AMBASSADOR 
MENTIONED RECENT DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING TNI FLIGHT 
CLEARANCE TO OPERATE THE USDAO C-12 AIRCRAFT IN COUNTRY, 
ASKING FOR THE MINISTER\'S ASSISTANCE TO RESOLVE THIS 
PROBLEM AND EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR EMBASSY MEMBERS 
TO TRAVEL FREELY IN THE COUNTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR 
EXPRESSED THE STRONG DESIRE FOR CONTINUED CLOSE 
COOPERATION ON COUNTER-TERRORISM MATTERS AND OFFERED 
TO SEND AN EMBASSY REPRESENTATIVE TO PROVIDE MINISTER 
SUDARSONO WITH A DETAILED BRIEFING ON THIS SUBJECT. 
FINALLY, THE AMBASSADOR BRIEFLY DISCUSSED THE U.S. 
LEGISLATION ON MILITARY TRANSPARENCY AND PROVIDED 
MINISTER SUDARSONO WITH A MORE DETAILED NON-PAPER ON THE 
ISSUE.  MINISTER SUDARSONO WAS ALREADY GENERALLY 
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE LEGISLATION.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE\'S MEETING WITH XANANA GUSMAO 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS PAMELA SLUTZ; REASON 1.5(D). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (C) AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE, ASSISTANT SECRETARY ROTH, 
AMBASSADOR GELBARD AND PARTY MET A WARM AND ELABORATE 
RECEPTION AT XANANA GUSMAO\'S COMPOUND IN AILEU, EAST 
TIMOR ON NOVEMBER 23. AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE STRESSED 
U.S. DETERMINATION TO RESOLVE THE REFUGEE SITUATION IN 
WEST TIMOR AND ARRANGED FOR XANANA TO RECORD A 
STATEMENT REFUTING MILITIA DISINFORMATION AND URGING 
THE REFUGEES TO RETURN. HE ADVISED XANANA THAT HE 
WOULD BE DEALING WITH A MUCH IMPROVED GOI DURING HIS 
UPCOMING VISIT TO JAKARTA.  XANANA MADE CLEAR HIS 
RESISTANCE TO \"BEING FORCED TO ACCEPT MILITIA LEADERS 
AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.\"  THE CNRT LEADER ALSO 
REMAINED CONCERNED THAT UNTAET AND THE NGO\'S WERE NOT 
ADEQUATELY CONSULTING HIS PEOPLE.  XANANA INDICATED 
THAT HE AND HIS ADVISORS NOW WERE THINKING ABOUT A 
QUICKER TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE. 
 
WARM RECEPTION 
 
3.  (C) DUE TO XANANA GUSMAO\'S ILLNESS (THE 
CNRT LEADER WAS FEVERISH AND COUGHING -- WE 
ARRANGED FOR A U.S. MILITARY DOCTOR TO VISIT 
HIM ON NOVEMBER 24), AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE AND 
PARTY ASCENDED VIA UNTAET HELICOPTER TO 
XANANA\'S CURRENT HEADQUARTERS AT AILEU, A COOL 
MOUNTAIN TOWN 50 KM SOUTH OF DILI.  SEVERAL 
HUNDRED ARMED AND SMARTLY UNIFORMED FALINTIL 
GUERRILLAS STOOD AT ATTENTION AT THE LARGE 
FIELD WHERE THE HELICOPTER LANDED, MANY WITH 
LONG HAIR PROTRUDING FROM THEIR RED BERETS. 
AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE WAS GREETED BY XANANA, 
WHO WAS FLANKED BY UDT (TIMORESE DEMOCRATIC 
UNION) LEADER JOAO CARRASCALAO AND ALSO 
ACCOMPANIED BY DEPUTY FALINTIL COMMANDER MATAN 
RUAK. AFTER PASSING THROUGH HUNDREDS OF 
ONLOOKERS AND SEVERAL ROWS OF WOMEN DRESSED IN 
A VARIETY OF COLORFUL EAST TIMORESE 
TRADITIONAL GARMENTS, AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE AND 
PARTY JOINED XANANA AND HIS AIDES ON A COVERED 
STAGE TO WATCH AN IMPRESSIVE PROGRAM PRESENTED 
BY TRADITIONAL DANCERS REPRESENTING VARIOUS 
FALINTIL REGIONS.  SOME NOT SO TRADITIONAL 
DANCING BY THE 8 TO 10 YEAR OLD SET (TO 
CURRENT POP HITS PLAYED ON A SCRATCHY TAPE) 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE FESTIVE, RELAXED 
ATMOSPHERE.  XANANA CALLED THE PROCEEDINGS 
\"OUR FIRST STATE VISIT.\" 
 
U.S. WANTS TO HELP 
 
4. (C) FOLLOWING BRIEF REMARKS BY XANANA AND 
OTHERS IN THE LOCAL TETUN LANGUAGE, AMBASSADOR 
HOLBROOKE WAS ASKED TO SPEAK.  HOLBROOKE 
SALUTED THE EAST TIMORESE FOR HAVING ACHIEVED 
PEACE AND FREEDOM AFTER A LONG AND COURAGEOUS 
STRUGGLE AND DREW APPLAUSE WITH HIS REMARK 
THAT EAST TIMOR WOULD SOON BE THE FIRST NEW 
NATION OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY.  HOLBROOKE 
RECALLED THAT HE HAD JUST SEEN THE REFUGEES IN 
WEST TIMOR, WHO WERE BEING TOLD LIES ABOUT THE 
SITUATION IN EAST TIMOR.  HOLBROOKE ADDED THAT 
IF ONLY THE REFUGEES IN WEST TIMOR COULD SEE 
THIS PEACEFUL SCENE IN AILEU, THEY WOULD 
RETURN.  WHILE THE EAST TIMORESE HAD GAINED 
THEIR FREEDOM THEMSELVES, THE U.S. AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTED TO HELP IN 
CREATING A NEW STABLE DEMOCRACY.  THE 
LEADERSHIP MUST COME FROM THE EAST TIMORESE 
THEMSELVES, HOWEVER. 
 
A NEW SITUATION IN JAKARTA 
 
5. (C) MOVING TO XANANA\'S CURRENT RESIDENCE 
FOR A MORE PRIVATE DISCUSSION, HOLBROOKE AND 
A/S ROTH STRESSED TO XANANA THAT HE WAS NOW 
DEALING WITH A VERY DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT IN 
JAKARTA, ONE WHICH STILL INCLUDED SOME BAD 
ELEMENTS BUT WHICH ALSO HAD A PRESIDENT AND 
FOREIGN MINISTER WHO WERE STRESSING TOLERANCE, 
AND AN ATTORNEY GENERAL ANXIOUS TO INVESTIGATE 
THE ABUSES IN EAST TIMOR TO DEMONSTRATE THAT 
INDONESIA HAS CHANGED.  HOLBROOKE URGED XANANA 
TO REMEMBER THAT HE HAD SOME FRIENDS IN 
JAKARTA, INCLUDING PRESIDENT WAHID.  XANANA 
CONFIRMED THAT HE WAS MEETING PRESIDENT WAHID 
IN JAKARTA ON NOVEMBER 30. 
 
FOCUS ON REFUGEES 
 
6. (C) HOLBROOKE TOLD XANANA THAT THERE WERE 
FOUR ISSUES DRIVING THE INDONESIA/EAST TIMOR 
DYNAMIC: THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN JAKARTA 
BETWEEN THE REFORMERS AND THE STATUS QUO 
SUPPORTERS; THE SITUATION IN WEST TIMOR, WHERE 
AT LEAST ONE-EIGHTH OF THE EAST TIMORESE 
POPULATION REMAINED TRAPPED; THE CNRT\'S 
RELATIONS WITH JAKARTA; AND THE ACEH 
SITUATION.  HOLBROOKE SAID THE FOCUS OF HIS 
TRIP HAD BEEN THE PEOPLE IN THE CAMPS IN WEST 
TIMOR.  DISINFORMATION AND INTIMIDATION WERE 
PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM RETURNING HOME.  IN ONE 
INSTANCE, THREE DAYS AGO, 1000 REFUGEES HAD 
SIGNED UP TO DEPART AND ONLY 350 SHOWED UP, A 
CLEAR INDICATION OF THE SCALE OF INTIMIDATION. 
 
NEED TO GET MESSAGE OUT 
 
7. (C) HOLBROOKE TOLD XANANA THAT HE MUST 
URGENTLY BROADCAST HIS MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE 
IN THE CAMPS VIA ALL POSSIBLE MEANS AND 
ADVISED HIM TO INSIST TO THE GOI DURING HIS 
UPCOMING VISIT TO JAKARTA THAT THERE WOULD BE 
NO GOOD RELATIONS UNTIL THE CAMPS WERE 
CLEARED.  (COMMENT:  AT HOLBROOKE\'S URGING, 
XANANA CONVEYED SUCH A MESSAGE URGING REFUGEES 
NOT TO BELIEVE RUMORS OF CONTINUING CONFLICT 
IN EAST TIMOR AND ASSURING THEM THEY HAD 
NOTHING TO FEAR, VIA THE MEDIA COVERING THIS 
EVENT.  END COMMENT.) 
 
AGREEMENT RAISES PRESSURE ON GOI 
 
8. (C) XANANA EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT A DEAL TO 
PERMIT THE REFUGEES TO RETURN MIGHT FORCE HIS 
PEOPLE \"TO ACCEPT THE MILITIA COMMANDERS AS IF 
NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.\"  HOLBROOKE ASSURED 
XANANA THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED AT THE BORDER 
ON NOVEMBER 22 DID NOT REQUIRE XANANA TO MAKE 
ANY SUCH DEAL. HOLBROOKE ADDED THAT HIS PARTY 
HAD UPPED THE PRESSURE ON THE INDONESIAN 
MILITARY BY TAKING THEM INTO THE CAMPS 
ACCOMPANIED BY THE INDONESIAN AND 
INTERNATIONAL PRESS.  WHILE IT REMAINED TO BE 
SEEN WHETHER THE INDONESIAN COMMITMENTS WOULD BE 
IMPLEMENTED, THE CAMP VISIT WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP 
WHICH RAISED THE PRESSURE ON THE INDONESIANS. 
 
A FASTER TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE? 
 
9. (C) AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE ASKED XANANA IF 
HE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHEN INDEPENDENCE 
SHOULD BE ACHIEVED.  XANANA SAID HIS AND HIS 
ADVISORS\' CURRENT THINKING WAS \"WHY WAIT SUCH 
A LONG TIME?\"  XANANA ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE 
EASIER AND FASTER FOR AN INDEPENDENT 
GOVERNMENT TO ARRIVE AT STRATEGIC DECISIONS 
THAN IS THE CASE WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION OF 
CONFUSING MANDATES. (COMMENT. ON NOVEMBER 22 
ACTING UNTAET DEPUTY DAVID HARLAND TOLD POLOFF 
THAT TOP UNTAET OFFICIALS ALSO WERE SERIOUSLY 
CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF A QUICKER 
TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE THAN ORIGINALLY 
ENVISIONED.  END COMMENT.) 
 
TIMING IMPORTANT 
 
10. (C) AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE SAID THE FIRST 
ISSUE IS FOR THE EAST TIMORESE TO BUILD UP THE 
GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEM. THEN 
THEY CAN DECIDE WHEN TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT 
MEMBER OF THE UN.  XANANA AND DE MELLO MUST 
CONSULT CLOSELY TO ARRIVE AT THIS DECISION. 
THE U.S. WOULD SUPPORT WHATEVER WAS DECIDED 
AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE BEFORE AND AFTER 
INDEPENDENCE.  TIMING WAS IMPORTANT: WAITING 
TOO LONG WOULD PROVOKE RESISTANCE WHILE MOVING 
TO INDEPENDENCE BEFORE EAST TIMOR WAS PREPARED 
ALSO WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.  XANANA 
SAID THAT PRESENT UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING 
HUMAN RESOURCES COMPLICATED ANY DECISION ON 
TIMING FOR INDEPENDENCE.  AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE 
SAID THAT WHILE NO DECISION NEED BE MADE RIGHT 
AWAY, IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BEGIN FOCUSSING ON 
THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE UN\'S TIMETABLE FOR THE 
TRANSITION WOULD BE A KEY DETERMINING FACTOR 
IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. 
 
WHICH CURRENCY? 
 
11. (C) IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE\'S 
QUERY, XANANA SAID THAT \"FOR POLITICAL 
REASONS\" THE CNRT WAS CONSIDERING USING THE 
PORTUGUESE ESCUDO AS EAST TIMOR\'S CURRENCY. 
HOLBROOKE POINTED OUT THAT THE ESCUDO WOULD BE 
REPLACED BY THE EURO IN ANOTHER 18 MONTHS AND 
HE SUGGESTED THAT A DECISION ON CURRENCY BE 
LEFT TO THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS.  XANANA SAID 
THE IMF HAD BEEN AMENABLE TO USING THE 
AUSTRALIAN OR SINGAPORE DOLLAR OR THE RUPIAH. 
 
FUTURE GOVERNANCE 
 
12. (C) AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE ASKED ABOUT PLANS FOR A 
GOVERNING COUNCIL DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. 
XANANA SAID HE AND SRSG DE MELLO (WHO ARRIVED FROM 
DILI TO JOIN THE MEETING AT THIS POINT) HAD AGREED IN 
PRINCIPLE ON A TRANSITION ADVISORY COUNCIL.  XANANA 
SAID THE CNRT WOULD DISBAND AT INDEPENDENCE WITH THE 
POLITICAL PARTIES BECOMING THE MAIN ACTORS.

SUBJECT: SECRETARY COHEN\'S LUNCH WITH BAMBANG YUDHOYONO 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLITICAL COUNSELOR GREG FERGIN FOR 
REASON 1.5(D). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY.  IN A SEPTEMBER 18 LUNCH, INDONESIAN COORDINATING 
MINISTER FOR POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND SECURITY AFFAIRS BAMBANG 
YUDHOYONO TOLD SECRETARY COHEN THAT ON YUDHOYONO\'S MISSION TO NEW 
YORK, HE WILL DESCRIBE IN DETAIL INDONESIA\'S AGENDA FOR DISARMING 
AND DISBANDING THE MILITIAS.  HE SAID INDONESIA WOULD FIRST TRY 
PERSUASIVE METHODS AND THEN \"REPRESSIVE\" METHODS.  THE GOI HAS 
ESTABLISHED A FIRM TIMETABLE FOR DISARMAMENT; POLICE, BACKED UP BY 
THE MILITARY, WILL TAKE COERCIVE MEASURES IF THE MILITIAS DO NOT 
TURN IN THEIR WEAPONS FROM SEPTEMBER 22-24.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT 
SIX SUSPECTS IN THE ATAMBUA KILLINGS HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND THAT 
OTHER ARRESTS, INCLUDING OF NOTORIOUS MILITIA LEADER EURICO 
GUTERRES, ARE IMMINENT.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT HE FACES PRESSURE 
FROM ULTRA-NATIONALIST FORCES WITHIN INDONESIAN SOCIETY AND IN THE 
INDONESIAN CABINET.  HE SAID THAT MANY INDONESIANS MISUNDERSTAND 
THE UNSC RESOLUTION AND MISREAD INTERNATIONAL CONCERN AS A THREAT 
TO INDONESIAN SOVEREIGNTY.  HE SAID DELAYING THE UNSC MISSION 
WOULD HELP DISARM NATIONALIST CRITICS.  HE ALSO URGED COHEN TO 
ALLAY NATIONALIST CONCERNS BY INCLUDING A STRONG STATEMENT OF 
SUPPORT FOR INDONESIA\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY IN HIS PRESS 
STATEMENT. 
 
3. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED.  SECRETARY COHEN TOLD YUDHOYONO THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY EXPECTS QUICK RESULTS ON DISARMING AND 
DISBANDING THE TIMOR MILITIAS AND ON PROSECUTING THOSE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE MURDERS OF UN PEACEKEEPERS AND THE ATAMBUA MASSACRE OF 
UNHCR STAFF.  COHEN SAID WHEN SENIOR INDONESIAN OFFICIALS DENY 
INDONESIA\'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATAMBUA MURDERS OR EVEN BLAME 
FOREIGNERS FOR THE KILLINGS, IT HURTS INDONESIA\'S INTERNATIONAL 
IMAGE.  HE SAID THAT THE U.S. IS READY TO SUPPORT INDONESIA\'S 
EFFORTS AT MILITARY REFORM, BUT THAT EVENTS OVER THE PAST SIX 
MONTHS HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO REESTABLISH MILITARY-MILITARY 
TIES.  COHEN SAID THE \"WORLD IS LOOKING AT INDONESIA THROUGH THE 
LENS OF TIMOR,\" AND URGED YUDHOYONO TO TAKE SWIFT MEASURES, 
INCLUDING ACTION AGAINST EX-INDONESIAN ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL 
ACTIVE IN TRAINING AND EQUIPPING THE MILITIAS.  STRONG MEASURES 
WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE 
INDONESIAN MILITARY IS READY TO TAKE A RESPONSIBLE ROLE IN 
INDONESIAN SOCIETY. END SUMMARY. 
 
4. (U) ON SEPTEMBER 18, SECRETARY COHEN AND AMBASSADOR GELBARD MET 
OVER LUNCH WITH INDONESIAN COORDINATING MINISTER FOR POLITICAL, 
SOCIAL, AND SECURITY AFFAIRS BAMBANG YUDHOYONO.  CHIEF OF STAFF 
FOR TERRITORIAL AFFAIRS LT. GENERAL AGUS WIDJOYO, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY 
UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES BODNER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE KENNETH BACON, AND DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE 
SKIP BOYCE ALSO ATTENDED THE LUNCH. 
 
-------------------- 
YUDHOYONO: GOI PLANS 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT ON HIS MISSION TO NEW YORK HE WOULD 
EXPLAIN THE CURRENT SITUATION IN WEST TIMOR, CONVEY THE GOI\'S 
RESPONSE TO UNSC RESOLUTION 1319, DESCRIBE THE GOI\'S PLAN OF 
ACTION FOR DISBANDING AND DISARMING THE MILITIAS AND THE 
PROSECUTION OF THOSE GUILTY OF CRIMES, AND DISCUSS HOW THE GOI CAN 
WORK WITH UNTAET ON REPATRIATION OF TIMOR IDPS.  YUDHOYONO SAID 
THAT THE GOI WOULD FIRST TAKE A \"PERSUASIVE APPROACH\" IN DISARMING 
THE MILITIAS.  YUDHOYONO HAD MET ON SEPTEMBER 14 WITH MILITIA 
LEADERS AS PART OF THAT PERSUASIVE APPROACH AND THE MILITIA 
LEADERS HAD PROMISED TO TURN IN THEIR WEAPONS.  YUDHOYONO FEELS 
CONFIDENT THAT THE MILITIAS WILL DISARM VOLUNTARILY, BUT THE GOI 
HAS SET A STRICT TIMETABLE FOR COMPLIANCE.  IF THE MILITIAS DO NOT 
TURN OVER THEIR WEAPONS DURING THE THREE-DAY PERIOD SEPTEMBER 22- 
24, THE INDONESIAN POLICE, BACKED UP BY THE MILITARY, WILL 
IMPLEMENT THE \"REPRESSIVE\" PHASE OF DISARMING THE MILITIAS. 
YUDHOYONO SAID THAT A PERIOD OF MONITORING AND FOLLOW UP WILL ALSO 
BE REQUIRED BECAUSE THE MILITIAS MAY HAVE MANY HIDDEN CACHES OF 
ARMS.  HE SAID THAT DISARMING THE MILITIAS WOULD BE A LONG 
PROCESS. 
 
------------------ 
ARRESTS PROCEEDING 
------------------ 
 
6. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THE PROSECUTION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
KILLINGS AT ATAMBUA IS PROCEEDING.  SIX SUSPECTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATAMBUA KILLINGS.  OTHER ARRESTS, 
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AND OTHER INVESTIGATIONS, ARE IMMINENT. 
YUDHOYONO SAID THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT NOTORIOUS MILITIA LEADER 
EURICO GUTERRES WOULD SOON BE ARRESTED, THOUGH NOT ON CHARGES 
RELATED TO THE ATAMBUA KILLINGS.  SECRETARY COHEN AND AMBASSADOR 
GELBARD REVIEWED THE EVIDENCE PLACING GUTERRES AT ATAMBUA ON THE 
DAY OF THE KILLINGS.  YUDHOYONO INITIALLY SAID THAT EURICO MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN IN WEST TIMOR BECAUSE OF THE DEATH THE PREVIOUS DAY OF 
MILITIA LEADER OLIVIO MORUK.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THE 
SIX-HOUR TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN KUPANG AND ATAMBUA MEANT THAT 
GUTERRES MUST HAVE DEPARTED BY 5:30 A.M. TO ARRIVE IN ATAMBUA. 
THIS WAS EVIDENCE OF GUTERRES\'S PREMEDITATED MALICE.  YUDHOYONO 
FINALLY SAID THAT THE POLICE WILL HAVE TO BUILD A CASE TO LINK 
GUTERRES DIRECTLY TO THE CRIMES. 
 
-------------------- 
NATIONALIST PRESSURE 
-------------------- 
 
7. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT, AS IN ANY DEVELOPING COUNTRY, THERE 
ARE \"ULTRA-NATIONALIST\" ELEMENTS IN SOCIETY AND IN THE CABINET. 
HE SAID THAT HE ADVOCATES WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
AND FACING UP TO INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS, BUT FACES STRONG PRESSURE 
FROM THE NATIONALISTS.  MANY INDONESIANS, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF 
PARLIAMENT AND OFFICIALS MISREAD INTERNATIONAL CONCERN OVER TIMOR 
AND OTHER TOPICS AS A THREAT TO INDONESIAN SOVEREIGNTY. 
NATIONALISM HAD CAUSED CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE FOR YUDHOYONO 
PERSONALLY.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE HAD PREVIOUSLY TAKEN A GREAT DEAL OF 
FLAK FOR ADVOCATING A POLICY OF COOPERATION WITH INTERFET. 
SIMILARLY, RESISTANCE FROM OLDER OFFICERS IN THE MILITARY HAD 
STYMIED YUDHOYONO\'S BLUEPRINT FOR MILITARY REFORM, WHICH HAD BEEN 
AGREED UPON TWO YEARS AGO.  HE ASKED FOR U.S. SUPPORT AND PATIENCE 
OVER THE LONG TERM. 
 
------------ 
UNSC MISSION 
------------ 
 
8. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT INDONESIANS, AND SPECIFICALLY 
\"ULTRANATIONALISTS,\" MISUNDERSTAND THE UN THESE INDONESIANS EQUATE 
ANYTHING RELATED TO THE UN WITH UN PEACEKEEPING OR A UN TRIBUNAL. 
SUCH SENTIMENTS HAD LED TO INDONESIAN RESISTANCE TO THE UNSC 
MISSION ON WEST TIMOR.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT THE MISSION WOULD BEST 
BE DELAYED SO THAT IT COULD CONFIRM INDONESIAN PROGRESS ON THE 
WEST TIMOR CRISIS RATHER THAN COME UP WITH \"A NEW PACKAGE\" ON WEST 
TIMOR.  RESISTANCE TO THE MISSION, HE SAID, MIGHT BE OVERCOME 
MERELY BY CHANGING THE TIMING.  IN RESPONSE, AMBASSADOR GELBARD 
NOTED THAT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE KILLINGS AND IN 
THE ABSENCE OF CONCRETE ACTIONS, FURTHER DELAY WAS INCREASINGLY 
DIFFICULT.  YUDHOYONO ALSO SAID THAT A DELEGATION OF \"BLUE BERETS\" 
MIGHT BE LESS INFLAMMATORY TO NATIONALIST PASSIONS THAN A UNSC 
MISSION.  (NOTE: YUDHOYONO\'S REFERENCE TO \"BLUE BERETS\" PROBABLY 
MEANT UN MILITARY OBSERVERS.)  THE SECRETARY AND THE AMBASSADOR 
REBUTTED THAT IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A GROUP OF SIX DIPLOMATS 
WOULD BE PERCEIVED AS MORE THREATENING THAN A MILITARY DELEGATION. 
MOREOVER, THERE WAS A PRECEDENT FOR THE MISSION IN LAST YEAR\'S 
UNSC MISSION.  FINALLY, INACCURATE, AND PICAYUNE, INDONESIAN 
CRITICISM OVER THE DATES LISTED IN THE UNSC RESOLUTION WAS NOT 
BECOMING EITHER. 
 
------------------------------- 
COHEN: WORLD WAITING FOR ACTION 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) SECRETARY COHEN SAID THAT WEST TIMOR WAS THE MAIN TOPIC OF 
DISCUSSION DURING HIS ENTIRE VISIT.  THE U.S. AND THE ENTIRE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY EXPECT THE GOI TO TAKE SWIFT, STRONG 
ACTION TO DISBAND AND DISARM THE MILITIAS AND TO BRING TO JUSTICE 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLINGS OF UN PEACEKEEPERS AND FOR THE 
ATAMBUA MASSACRE.  HE SAID THAT WHEN SENIOR INDONESIAN OFFICIALS 
PUBLICLY DISPUTE INDONESIAN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEMS IN 
WEST TIMOR AND EVEN BLAME THE ATAMBUA KILLINGS ON FOREIGNERS (AS 
HAD BEEN STATED MORE THAN ONCE BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER), IT WAS 
NOT HELPFUL TO INDONESIA\'S IMAGE.  SECRETARY COHEN HAD ALSO BEEN 
DISAPPOINTED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER\'S STATEMENT THAT THE MILITARY 
WAS NOT ABLE TO DISARM THE MILITIAS.  SUCH STATEMENTS INDICATE 
THAT INDONESIA IS NOT FACING UP TO ITS OBLIGATION TO SOLVE THE 
PROBLEMS IN WEST TIMOR.  AMBASSADOR GELBARD SAID THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, HAVING PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED GUARANTEES OF 
THE UNHCR WORKERS\' SAFETY, WAS NOW ADAMANT THAT INDONESIA DO MORE 
THAN MAKE COMMITMENTS, BUT TAKE REAL ACTION.  COHEN SUGGESTED THAT 
IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO MOVE AGAINST THE EX-MILITARY 
WHO TRAIN AND EQUIP THE MILITIAS.  WHEN YUDHOYONO EQUIVOCATED OVER 
POSSIBLE EX-MILITARY INVOLVEMENT, AMBASSADOR GELBARD SAID THERE IS 
SOLID EVIDENCE THAT THE MILITIAS HAVE RECEIVED SMALL-UNIT TRAINING 
AND NEW ARMS AND MATERIEL FROM MILITARY SOURCES. YUDHOYONO SAID 
THAT HE HAD ASKED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THAT THE REGIONAL 
MILITARY COMMAND INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF EX-MILITARY OFFICERS\' 
INVOLVEMENT. 
 
------------- 
MILITARY TIES 
------------- 
 
10. (C) YUDHOYONO DESCRIBED HOW INDONESIA WANTS TO MOVE TOWARD A 
MORE PROFESSIONAL AND EFFECTIVE MILITARY.  HE REQUESTED THAT THE 
U.S. ESTABLISH BETTER MILITARY TO MILITARY TIES TO ASSIST 
INDONESIA\'S EFFORTS.  COHEN SAID THAT THE U.S. LOOKED FORWARD TO 
THE TIME WHEN CONDITIONS ALLOW THE REESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY TO 
MILITARY TIES.  COHEN SAID THAT PERSONALLY HE GENERALLY ADVOCATES 
IMET AND OTHER MILITARY TIES; HOWEVER, CONTINUING CONCERNS OVER 
TIMOR IN PARTICULAR HAVE KEPT STRICT CONGRESSIONAL PROHIBITIONS 
SOLIDLY IN PLACE.  HE NOTED THAT THE USG HAD PROVIDED C-130 PARTS 
AS A GESTURE OF GOOD WILL.  UNFORTUNATELY, DETERIORATING EVENTS 
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS HAVE NOW UNDERMINED PROGRESS AT 
REESTABLISHING MILITARY TIES.  SECURITY IN TIMOR WAS BETTER A YEAR 
AGO, HE SAID.  WHEN TIES ARE GRADUALLY REESTABLISHED, THE U.S. 
WILL CONCENTRATE FIRST ON THE NAVY, AIR FORCE, AND MARINES BEFORE 
MOVING TO THE ARMY, WHERE REFORM EFFORTS HAVE LAGGED.  YUDHOYONO 
SAID THAT HE ALWAYS PREFERS FRANK DIALOGUE AND DIALOGUE.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, HE FOUND THE SECRETARY\'S AND AMBASSADOR\'S REMARKS STRONG 
BUT USEFUL BECAUSE THEY WERE FRANKLY STATED. 
 
------------- 
NEED A SIGNAL 
------------- 
 
11. (C) COHEN SUMMED UP BY SAYING THAT THE U.S. AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES WERE LOOKING TO INDONESIA TO SEND A SIGNAL.  IF ACTION 
IS TAKEN IN A SHORT TIME TO ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS IT WILL 
SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE THAT THE MILITARY IS READY TO PLAY A MORE 
CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN INDONESIA AND THAT INDONESIA IS READY TO PLAY 
A MORE POSITIVE INTERNATIONAL ROLE.  FAIRLY OR NOT, COHEN SAID, 
\"THE WORLD IS LOOKING AT INDONESIA THROUGH THE LENS OF EAST 
TIMOR.\"  THE U.S. HAS A SELFISH INTEREST IN PROMOTING THE 
STABILITY AND PROSPERITY OF A UNIFIED INDONESIA, WHICH WOULD HAVE 
A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE ENTIRE REGION.  COHEN CALLED ON THE GOI 
TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ALLOW THE U.S. TO HELP INDONESIA. 
A STRONG INDONESIA IS EVERYONE\'S GOAL, HE SAID

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR CALLS ON JUSUF KALLA 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER ANDREW T. HINTZ FOR 
REASON 1.5 B, D. 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY: THE AMBASSADOR TOLD PEOPLES\' WELFARE 
COORDINATING MINISTER YUSUF KALLA ON NOVEMBER 30 THAT THE 
U.S. WANTS TO HELP INDONESIA SOLVE SEPARATIST AND OTHER 
CHALLENGES.  KALLA SAID RECENTLY PASSED AUTONOMY LAWS WOULD 
ADDRESS MOST SEPARATIST DEMANDS, BUT THAT INGRAINED DISTRUST 
WOULD BE HARD TO OVERCOME. THE AMBASSADOR PRESSED KALLA ON 
COMBATING EXTREMIST GROUPS LIKE LASKAR JIHAD (LJ).  KALLA 
SAID THAT LJ WAS NOT ENTIRELY TO BLAME FOR RELIGIOUS 
CONFLICTS; HE SAID THE GOI HAD FORMED A MULTI-SERVICE JOINT 
BATTALION TO QUELL FIGHTING IN THE MOLUCCAS.  KALLA SAID TO 
FIGHT POVERTY THE GOI SHOULD FOCUS ON WEALTH DISPARITY, WHILE 
CHANNELING FOREIGN INVESTMENT TOWARD PRIVATIZATION OF 
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES.  KALLA SAID THE GOI SUPPORTS THE WAR 
ON TERRORISM, AND THAT HE PERSONALLY HAD DEFLECTED CRITICISM 
OF THE US-LED MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN AFGHANISTAN.  KALLA IS A 
THOUGHTFUL INTERLOCUTOR, BUT HIS COMMENTS BETRAYED A 
RELUCTANCE (COMMON AMONG INDONESIAN OFFICIALS) TO ADDRESS 
ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES IN RESOLVING SEPARATIST AND SECTARIAN 
CONFLICTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
US SUPPORT FOR INDONESIA AFFIRMED 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) DURING HIS NOVEMBER 30 INTRODUCTORY CALL ON PEOPLE\'S 
WELFARE COORDINATING MINISTER YUSUF KALLA, THE AMBASSADOR 
STRESSED US SUPPORT FOR INDONESIA\'S NATIONAL INTEGRITY.  THE 
AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE USG HAS CONSISTENTLY CONVEYED ITS 
SUPPORT FOR A UNITED INDONESIA TO SEQRATIST GROUPS LIKE THE 
FREE ACEH MOVEMENT (GAM).  THE AMBASSADOR OPINED, HOWEVER, 
THAT THE PEACE PROCESS IN WEST PAPUA IS MUCH FURTHER ALONG 
THAN IN ACEH.  HE NOTED THAT THE REGIONAL AUTONOMY 
LEGISLATION FOR PAPUA WAS FAR MORE INCLUSIVE THAN THAT FOR 
ACEH THANKS TO THE PAPUAN PUBLIC\'S BROADER INPUTS IN THE 
DRAFTING PROCESS.  THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT, IN ACEH, GAM 
HAD DRIVEN THE DEBATE EVEN THOUGH GAM DOES NOT FULLY 
REPRESENT THE ACHENESE PEOPLE. 
 
4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ALSO STRESSED THAT, WHILE UNWILLING TO 
BECOME DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN MEDIATING SEPARATIST CONFLICTS 
LIKE ACEH, THE U.S. IS KEEN TO HELP INDONESIA RESOLVE SUCH 
ISSUES PEACEFULLY.  THE AMBASSADOR ADDED HE WAS TROUBLED BY 
REPORTS THAT THE GOI WAS POISED TO PURSUE A MILITARY SOLUTION 
IN ACEH, WHERE INDONESIA WAS SAID TO BE DEPLOYING SEVERAL 
EXTRA BATTALIONS OF TROOPS.  HE ADVISED KALLA THAT THE 
POLICE, AND NOT THE ARMED FORCES (TNI), SHOULD HAVE THE LEAD 
IN RESTORING ORDER IN THE PROVINCE, AND NOTED THAT THE US 
COULD HELP STRENGTHEN POLICE CAPABILITIES THROUGH ITS LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. 
 
KALLA SEES SALVATION IN LEGISLATION 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) WHILE ADMITTING THAT INDONESIAN NATIONAL UNITY IS 
THREATENED BY SIGNIFICANT CENTRIFUGAL FORCES, KALLA SAID THAT 
VARIOUS REGIONAL AUTONOMY BILLS NOW BEFORE PARLIAMENT WOULD 
ADDRESS MOST SEPARATIST DEMANDS.  HE ADDED THAT THIS WAS 
PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR ACEH, WHERE HE CLAIMED THE DRAFT LAW 
ACCOUNTED FOR ALL SALIENT ISSUES, INCLUDING REVENUE SHARING 
AND IMPOSITION OF ISLAMIC (SYARIAH) LAW (HE NOTED, HOWEVER, 
THERE STILL IS NO CLEAR DEFINITION OF THE LATTER).  KALLA 
NEVERTHELESS CONCEDED THAT, IN THE CASE OF ACEH, A NEGOTIATED 
SETTLEMENT MIGHT BE STYMIED BY AN ACUTE LACK OF TRUST ON BOTH 
SIDES.  HE OPINED THAT THIS WOULD BE NO LESS TRUE OF THE 
POLICE, WHOSE HARDLINE MINDSET, HE BELIEVED, WOULD TAKE 
CONSIDERABLE TIME TO CHANGE. 
 
6.  (C) AGREEING WITH THE AMBASSADOR\'S VIEW THAT GAM DOES NOT 
TRULY REPRESENT THE ACEHNESE PEOPLE, KALLA DESCRIBED MANY OF 
GAM\'S MEMBERS AS RADICALIZED WAR-ORPHANS WHO HAVE TURNED TO 
BANDITRY UNDER THE GAM BANNER.  KALLA SAID THAT, BY CONTRAST, 
THE PAPUANS ARE NOT COMMITTED TO ARMED STRUGGLE, BEING LESS 
EDUCATED AND ENJOYING A RELATIVELY EASY LIFESTYLE.  HOWEVER, 
HE DISMISSED REPORTS OF AN INCREASE IN TNI DEPLOYMENTS TO 
ACEH AS \"DISINFORMATION,\" NOTING THAT, GIVEN DEPLOYMENTS 
ELSEWHERE, THE FIGURES OFTEN CITED WERE IN EXCESS OF THE 
TOTAL NUMBER OF BATTALIONS FIELDED BY TNI. 
 
IDPS AND LASKER JIHAD 
--------------------- 
 
7.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY ON THE GOI\'S 
PLANS FOR HANDLING THE CHALLENGE POSED BY INDONESIA\'S 1.3 
MILLION INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS), KALLA NOTED THAT 
IDPS RESULTED OF THREE TYPES OF REGIONAL CONFLICT: ETHNIC, 
RELIGIOUS, AND POLITICAL.  THE MINISTER SAID THAT, WHILE ALL 
WERE DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE, RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS POSED THE 
GREATEST PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY OFFERED LITTLE 
COMMON GROUND FOR COOPERATION AND RECONCILIATION.  HE NOTED 
THAT THE PROBLEM OFTEN WAS EXACERBATED BY ETHNIC AND ECONOMIC 
FACTORS, AND CITED THE MOLUCCAS AS AN EXAMPLE.  KALLA SAID 
THAT THE LOCAL MERCHANT CLASS WAS DOMINATED BY BUGINESE OR 
BUTONESE MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS, WHILE MOST LOCAL CHRISTIANS HAVE 
TRADITIONALLY OPTED FOR LESS LUCRATIVE CALLINGS AS PLANTATION 
LABOR OR IN THE BUREAUCRACY.  HE CLAIMED THE GOI WAS 
NEVERTHELESS PREPARED TO TAKE FIRM STEPS TO QUELL THE 
VIOLENCE IN THE MALUKUS, NOTING THAT A MULTI-SERVICE \"JOINT 
BATTALION\" HAD BEEN SPECIALLY FORMED BY TNI FOR THE TASK.  HE 
CONCEDED, HOWEVER, THAT LITTLE TRUST REMAINED BETWEEN THE 
COMMUNITIES, AND THAT DIVISIONS WOULD PERSIST INDEFINITELY. 
 
8.  (C) WHEN QUERIED BY THE AMBASSADOR ON LASKAR JIHAD\'S ROLE 
IN PROLONGING THE VIOLENCE AND GOI STEPS TO REIN IN SUCH 
GROUPS, KALLA REJOINED THAT GROUP WAS NOT ENTIRELY TO BLAME. 
A BUGINESE MUSLIM HIMSELF, THE MINISTER CONTENDED THAT 
CHRISTIAN MILITANTS FROM ACROSS INDONESIA, PARTICULARLY 
SUMATRAN BATAKS, ALSO HAVE TRAVELED TO AREAS OF SECTARIAN 
STRIFE LIKE THE MALUKUS AND CENTRAL SULAWESI.  KALLA 
NEVERTHELESS EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT THE \"JOINT BATTALION\" 
WOULD NEUTRALIZE SUCH INTERVENTION IN THE MALUKUS.  HE NOTED 
THAT IN CENTRAL SULAWESI, HOWEVER, THE FIGHTING HAD RESULTED 
IN 100-120,000 IDPS IN THE VICINITY OF PALU, MOST OF WHOM 
WERE HOUSED IN MAKESHIFT CAMPS, SCHOOLS, OR WITH RELATIVES. 
KALLA SAID THE GOI WAS TRYING TO ASSIST THEM, AS WELL AS TO 
INDUCE THEM TO RETURN HOME TO AVOID CONFLICT WITH LOCAL 
RESIDENTS.  HE ADDED THAT MUCH THE SAME WAS TRUE OF MADURESE 
IDPS IN CENTRAL KALIMANTAN, NOTING THE ISSUE HAD GREATLY 
IMPROVED WITH THE RETURN TO MADURA OF MOST OF THE IDPS, AND 
THE PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURE\'S PROMULGATION OF LAWS REGULATING 
COMMUNITY RELATIONS.  KALLA SQUARELY BLAMED THE MADURESE FOR 
THE VIOLENCE THAT HAD BEFALLEN THEM, HOWEVER, DESCRIBING 
THEIR CULTURE AND PROCLIVITY TO FORM GANGS (PARTICULARLY 
THOSE \"FROM SURABAYA\") AS \"TOO STRONG\" FOR LOCAL 
SENSITIVITIES. 
 
POVERTY ALLEVIATION: A NEW TACK 
------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) KALLA RESPONDED TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION ABOUT 
GOI\'S POVERTY ALLEVIATION STRATEGY BY SAYING THE GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD FOCUS PRIMARILY ON EQUITY ISSUES.  NOTING THE GOI 
PREVIOUSLY RELIED ON GROWTH-BASED DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES THAT 
ULTIMATELY BENEFITED ONLY THE ELITES, KALLA ARGUED THE 
GOVERNMENT NOW NEEDED TO CREATE EQUITY THROUGH INCOME GROWTH 
STRATEGIES: 
 
--THIS, HE EXPLAINED, COULD BE ACHIEVED AT THE \"MICRO\" LEVEL 
BY DEVELOPING SMALL ENTERPRISES, AGRICULTURE, AND SOCIAL 
WELFARE AND HEALTH SERVICES. 
 
--AT THE \"MACRO\" LEVEL, KALLA SAID, EXISTING INVESTMENT (NO 
NEW INVESTMENT WOULD BE NEEDED) COULD BE BETTER CHANNELED TO 
BENEFIT THE PEOPLE BY TARGETING SECTORS THAT WOULD SPUR 
DEVELOPMENT OF INDONESIA\'S DOMESTIC MARKET, AND TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THE PUBLIC\'S INCREASED PURCHASING POWER. 
 
10.  (C) KALLA SAID THAT FOREIGN INVESTMENT SHOULD BE DEVOTED 
TO PRIVATIZING EXISTING ENTERPRISES, RATHER THAN THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW ONES.  HE NOTED THAT THE LAST THING THE 
COUNTRY NEEDED WAS ANOTHER FIVE-STAR HOTEL.  WHILE CONCEDING 
THE AMBASSADOR\'S POINT THAT THE SEMEN GRESIK SALE HAD RUN 
INTO OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL INTERESTS, KALLA NOTED THAT 
SEVERAL OTHER IBRA-MANAGED ENTERPRISES WERE PRIMED FOR SALE, 
INCLUDING BANK CENTRAL ASIA (BCA) AND INDO-TV.  THE MINISTER 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE AMBASSADOR\'S VIEW THAT THE GOI MUST SELL AT 
LEAST ONE SUCH ASSET TO BOOST INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR 
CONFIDENCE. 
 
INDONESIANS LOVE AN UNDERDOG 
---------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) KALLA ENDED THE MEETING BY ASKING THE AMBASSADOR TO 
UNDERSTAND THE INDONESIAN PUBLIC\'S HOSTILITY TO US-LED 
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.  THE MINISTER CONTENDED 
THAT MOST INDONESIANS DO NOT CONNECT THE US CAMPAIGN WITH THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES.  HE NOTED HE OFTEN 
HAS RESPONDED TO PUBLIC QUERIES ABOUT HIS VIEWS ON \"US 
AGGRESSION\" IN AFGHANISTAN BY COUNTERING THAT THE ISSUE IS, 
MORE ACCURATELY, THE \"US RESPONSE TO THE WTC ATTACK.\"  KALLA 
ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT INDONESIAN PUBLIC\'S POSITION ON 
THE ISSUE ONLY REFLECTS ITS TENDENCY TO SIDE WITH THE 
UNDERDOG. 
 
12.  (C) THE MINISTER ALSO USED THE DISCUSSION TO HIGHLIGHT 
HIS PERSONAL PARTICIPATION IN DELIVERING GOI HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN.  KALLA NOTED HE HAD ACCOMPANIED AN 
AID CONSIGNMENT VIA C-130 TO PAKISTAN ON NOVEMBER 1, AND HAD 
MET WITH PRESIDENT PERVEZ MUSHARRAF.  THE PAKISTANI LEADER 
HAD SAID THAT THE TALIBAN HAD SET ISLAM BACK 500 YEARS, 
ACCORDING TO KALLA, WHO ADDED THAT HE SHARED MUSHARRAF\'S 
OBSERVATION WITH THE INDONESIAN PUBLIC AT A SEMINAR FOLLOWING 
HIS RETURN HOME. 
 
COMMENT: SOME CAUSES FOR CONCERN 
-------------------------------- 
 
13.  (C) KALLA\'S APPEAL THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE BASIS AND 
LIMITED EXTENT OF INDONESIAN PUBLIC ANTIPATHY FOR THE US-LED 
MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN AFGHANISTAN ECHOES A NOW-FAMILIAR 
REFRAIN BY SENIOR GOI OFFICIALS, WHO ARE KEEN TO ASSURE OF US 
THE GOI\'S FUNDAMENTAL SUPPORT FOR THE WAR ON TERRORISM. 
HOWEVER, MANY OF KALLA\'S OTHER COMMENTS AND OMISSIONS RAISE 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF GOI POLICY.  WE NOTE THAT, 
WHILE HE EXPRESSES PROFOUND CONFIDENCE THAT JAKARTA CAN 
LEGISLATE AWAY SEPARATIST THREATS IN ACEH AND ELSEWHERE, 
KALLA JOINS OTHER GOI OFFICIALS IN FAILING TO APPRECIATE THE 
NEED TO ACCOUNT ALSO FOR TNI AND POLICE ABUSES AGAINST 
CITIZENS IN THE OUTER PROVINCES.  THE MINISTER SIMILARLY 
JOINED MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES IN FAILING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE 
NEED TO DECISIVELY REIN IN PARAMILITARY RELIGIOUS MILITANTS 
LIKE LASKAR JIHAD, WHICH ALSO POSE AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO 
INDONESIA\'S STABILITY.  INDEED, KALLA\'S DEFENSIVE RESPONSE 
CITING EXTERNAL CHRISTIAN INTERVENTION IN AREAS ROCKED BY 
SECTARIAN VIOLENCE, WHILE DOWNPLAYING THE LASKAR JIHAD\'S 
PROMINENT ROLE, SUGGESTS A SUBJECTIVE POSITION ON THE ISSUE. 
THE MINISTER\'S READINESS TO TAKE SIDES IS SHOWCASED ELSEWHERE 
BY HIS QUICKNESS TO BLAME THE (MADURESE) VICTIMS OF COMMUNAL 
VIOLENCE IN KALIMANTAN. 
 
14.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  SIMILARLY, NOTHING ABOUT KALLA\'S 
APPROACH TO POVERTY ALLEVIATION STRIKES US AS HOPEFUL. 
INDONESIA NEEDS NEW INVESTMENT TO CREATE JOBS.  PEOPLE WITH 
JOBS CAN CLIMB OUT OF POVERTY.  THE REASON THAT THE 
GROWTH-LED DEVELOPMENT BENEFITED THE ELITE IN THE PAST WAS 
DUE TO GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED POLICIES.  SOEHARTO FREQUENTLY 
SPOKE OF THE NEED TO SUPPORT COOPERATIVES AND SMALL AND 
MEDIUM BUSINESS.  KALLA\'S ATTEMPTS TO DIRECT FUNDS TO THE 
SAME ENDS ARE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULTS.

TAGS: PREL, PTER, PGOV, MASS, ID 
SUBJECT: YUDHOYONO ASKS FOR U.S. HELP 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE STEPHEN D. MULL FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY. COORDINATING MINISTER FOR POLITICAL AND 
SECURITY AFFAIRS YUDHOYONO TOLD CHARGE JANUARY 9 THAT THE GOI 
NOW HAS POLITICAL SPACE TO ACT FIRMLY AGAINST RADICAL GROUPS. 
YUDHOYONO ASKED THAT THE U.S. HELP IMPROVE THE 
ANTI-TERRORISM CAPABILITIES OF THE INDONESIAN MILITARY. 
CHARGE REPLIED THAT NEW U.S. LEGISLATION MIGHT ALLOW 
ANTI-TERRORISM TRAINING FOR COUNTRIES LIKE INDONESIA. 
YUDHOYONO SAID HE HOPED THAT MILITARY TIES WOULD GENERALLY 
IMPROVE AND THAT THE IMMINENT HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL WOULD 
SATISFY LEAHY AMENDMENT CONCERNS OVER ACCOUNTABILITY. 
YUDHOYONO SOUGHT CLARIFICATION OF REMARKS BY DEPUTY SECRETARY 
WOLFOWITZ THAT INDONESIA MIGHT BE ONE OF THE NEXT THEATERS OF 
ACTION AGAINST AL-QAEDA; CHARGE STRESSED THAT U.S. IS NOT 
CONTEMPLATING UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION AGAINST TERRORISTS 
IN INDONESIA.  YUDHOYONO\'S REMARKS REVEALED THAT THE GOI\'S 
PLANS FOR ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATIONS AIM PRIMARILY AT 
SEPARATISM IN ACEH AND PAPUA AND INTERCOMMUNAL CONFLICT IN 
SULAWESI AND THE MOLUCCAS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (U) CHARGE MET JANUARY 9 WITH COORDINATING MINISTER FOR 
POLITICAL AND SECURITY AFFAIRS SUSILO BAMBANG YUDHOYONO, AT 
YUDHOYONO\'S REQUEST, TO DISCUSS ANTI-TERRORISM ISSUES. 
 
POLITICAL SPACE TO ACT FIRMLY 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT \"ENOUGH IS ENOUGH\" AND \"THE TIME 
HAS COME TO ACT FIRMLY\" AGAINST MUSLIM EXTREMISTS AND OTHERS 
WHO ENGAGE IN TERRORISM OR THREATEN PUBLIC ORDER.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, HE SAID HAD TAKE A TOUGH LINE AGAINST INTERCOMMUNAL 
VIOLENCE IN SULAWESI.  THE POLICE AND MILITARY HAVE DEPLOYED 
FIVE BATTALIONS TO CENTRAL SULAWESI AND HAVE BEGUN DISARMING 
AND EVENTUALLY \"REPATRIATING\" OUTSIDE EXTREMISTS LIKE LASKAR 
JIHAD.  YUDHOYONO PLANS A TRIP TO AMBON, MALUKU NEXT WEEK TO 
HELP ADDRESS INTERCOMMUNAL TENSIONS THERE AS WELL. 
 
5. (C) YUDHOYONO, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A ONE-DAY TRIP 
TO SINGAPORE, SAID SENIOR SINGAPOREAN OFFICIALS WERE APPALLED 
BY INDONESIAN MUSLIM LEADERS\' CALLING ON THE GOI TO REFRAIN 
FROM MOVING AGAINST LOCAL MILITANTS LINKED TO THE TERRORISTS 
RECENTLY ARRESTED IN SINGAPORE.  YUDHOYONO HAD REASSURED DPM 
TONY TAN AND SENIOR MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW THAT SUCH REMARKS 
DID NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF MOST INDONESIANS OR EVEN MOST 
INDONESIAN MUSLIMS.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT 
FOR MUSLIM EXTREMISTS HAS IN FACT WEAKENED GREATLY IN THE 
LAST FEW MONTHS SINCE IT PEAKED WHEN U.S.-LED MILITARY ACTION 
COMMENCED IN AFGHANISTAN.  YUDHOYONO BELIEVES THAT THE GOI 
NOW HAS THE POLITICAL SPACE TO ACT AGAINST MUSLIM EXTREMISTS. 
 HE SAID THAT PRESIDENT MEGAWATI, VICE PRESIDENT HAMZAH HAZ, 
AND PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS WILL NOW SUPPORT TOUGH MEASURES 
AGAINST ANYONE, INCLUDING RADICAL MUSLIMS, WHO THREATENS 
PUBLIC ORDER. 
 
U.S. ASSISTANCE 
--------------- 
 
6. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT LAST WEEK HE HAD CHAIRED AN 
INTERAGENCY MEETING TO REVIEW THE CAPABILITIES OF THE POLICE 
AND MILITARY TO ACT AGAINST INTERNAL SECURITY THREATS AND 
TERRORISTS.  HE SAID THE MILITARY CANNOT CURRENTLY ADDRESS 
ADEQUATELY INTERNAL THREATS FROM \"TERRORISTS\" IN POSO, AMBON, 
AND ACEH.  HE SAID THAT, FOR ITS PART, THE GOI NEEDS TO 
\"PROPERLY ALLOCATE\" RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE REAL NEEDS OF 
THE MILITARY.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT HE ALSO PLANS TO ASK FOR 
\"CONCRETE SUPPORT\" FROM THE U.S.  THOUGH HE PREVIEWED HIS 
PLANS FOR US, HE EMPHASIZED THAT HE WAS STILL AWAITING 
APPROVAL FROM PRESIDENT MEGAWATI AND VICE PRESIDENT HAMZAH 
HAZ BEFORE MAKING A FORMAL APPROACH.  YUDHOYONO DID NOT 
DISCUSS SPECIFICS EXCEPT TO NOTE THAT THE INDONESIAN MILITARY 
FACED SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF \"MOBILITY.\"  (ON THE MARGINS OF THE 
MEETING, YUDHOYONO\'S DEPUTY MENTIONED HELICOPTERS AND 
TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT.) 
 
NEW LEGISLATION 
--------------- 
 
7. (C) IN RESPONSE TO YUDHOYONO\'S FEELER, THE CHARGE NOTED 
THAT RECENTLY PASSED LEGISLATION AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FOREIGN MILITARIES FOR 
ANTI-TERRORISM THAT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF HELP FOR INDONESIA. 
WITHOUT GETTING INTO DETAILS, THE CHARGE SAID THAT ANY 
ASSISTANCE RENDERED TO INDONESIA WOULD PROBABLY BE USED FOR 
TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RATHER THAN EQUIPMENT.  THE 
CHARGE ALSO NOTED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAD REPEALED THE 
PROHIBITION ON COMMERCIAL SALES OF NON-LETHAL MILITARY ITEMS, 
BROADLY UNDERSTOOD.  WE COULD NOT PROVIDE FINANCING OR CREDIT 
FOR THESE COMMERCIAL PURCHASES, HOWEVER.  WE HAD ALREADY 
OFFERED SEVERAL TIMES TO REVIEW AN INDONESIAN WISH LIST IN 
ADVANCE AND INDICATE WHAT SPECIFIC ITEMS WE WOULD BE WILLING 
TO AUTHORIZE FOR COMMERCIAL SALE. 
 
BETTER MILITARY TIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) YUDHOYONO SAID THAT HE HOPED FOR GENERALLY BETTER 
MILITARY-MILITARY TIES.  HE ASKED RHETORICALLY EXACTLY WHAT 
THE U.S. HOPED TO ACHIEVE BY LIMITING MILITARY TIES. 
INDONESIA, YUDHOYONO SAID, NEEDED A ROBUST MILITARY TO SOLVE 
FUNDAMENTAL THREATS TO SOVEREIGNTY IN IRIAN JAYA AND ACEH, AS 
WELL AS INTERCOMMUNAL VIOLENCE IN CENTRAL SULAWESI AND THE 
MOLUCCAS.  WITHOUT A CAPABLE MILITARY, INDONESIA WOULD NOT BE 
ABLE TO COMBAT TERRORISM EFFECTIVELY AND WOULD FACE A 
FUNDAMENTAL THREAT TO ITS NATIONAL INTEGRITY.  THE CHARGE 
REPLIED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD YUDHOYONO\'S FRUSTRATION AND SAID 
THAT THE U.S. WANTED TO COOPERATE WITH A FRIENDLY MILITARY 
THAT RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS AND WAS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ABUSES. 
THOUGH THE POSSIBILITY OF ASSISTANCE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST 
TERRORISM MIGHT NOT BE ALL THAT YUDHOYONO HOPED FOR, IT WAS A 
GOOD START.  YUDHOYONO HOPED THE CONVENING OF THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS TRIBUNAL \"NEXT MONTH\" WOULD ADDRESS U.S. CONCERNS OVER 
HUMAN RIGHTS ACCOUNTABILITY. (NOTE: THE CONVENING OF THE 
TRIBUNAL IS PUBLICLY SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 15, BUT THERE HAVE 
BEEN MANY RUMORS OF A POSTPONEMENT. END NOTE.) HE STRESSED, 
HOWEVER, THAT IMPLEMENTING ACCOUNTABILITY WOULD TAKE TIME. 
 
WOLFOWITZ REMARKS 
----------------- 
 
9. (C) YUDHOYONO ASKED THE CHARGE FOR CLARIFICATION OF 
REPORTED REMARKS BY DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WOLFOWITZ 
THAT INDONESIA MAY BECOME ONE OF THE NEXT THEATERS OF ACTIONS 
AGAINST AL-QAEDA.  HE SAID \"YOU DO NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO ME, 
BUT I NEED TO EXPLAIN TO PRESIDENT MEGAWATI AND TO 
PARLIAMENT.\"  UNFORTUNATELY, SUCH REMARKS, WHICH YUDHOYONO 
SAID HE PERSONALLY UNDERSTOOD IN THE PROPER CONTEXT, ARE 
EASILY DISTORTED BY ISLAMIST CRITICS INTO ACCUSATIONS THAT 
THE U.S. PLANS TO ATTACK INDONESIA.  THE CHARGE REPLIED THAT 
WOLFOWITZ\'S PUBLIC REMARKS HAVE BEEN NEARLY IDENTICAL TO OUR 
PRIVATE MESSAGE TO THE GOI.  WE HAVE NATURAL CONCERNS THAT 
INDONESIA, AS A LARGE, OPEN COUNTRY, COULD BE VULNERABLE TO 
INFILTRATION BY AL-QAEDA OR OTHER TERRORISTS.  WE WANT TO 
WORK WITH THE GOI TO ADDRESS THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM, BUT WE 
HAVE NO PLANS FOR UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST 
INDONESIA.  TOO OFTEN, THE CHARGE SAID, THE PRESS DISTORTED 
OUR CONSISTENT MESSAGE. 
 
COMMENT: WHAT\'S THE REAL TARGET? 
-------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) INDONESIA DOES FACE SERIOUS LOGISTICS CHALLENGES THAT 
IMPEDE EFFECTIVE EFFORTS TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL TERROR. 
HOWEVER, WE DOUBT THE INTERNATIONAL THREAT IS THE GOI\'S 
PRIMARY CONCERN-EVEN IN THE WAKE OF RECENT ARRESTS IN THE 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  YUDHOYONO\'S REMARKS MADE CLEAR THAT 
THE GOI\'S CONCEPTION OF THE TERRORIST THREAT DIFFERS FROM THE 
U.S. CONCERN WITH INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS LIKE AL-QAEDA. 
YUDHOYONO BARELY MENTIONED INTERNATIONAL OR FOREIGN 
TERRORISM, RESERVING HIS REMARKS MAINLY FOR SEPARATISTS IN 
ACEH AND IRIAN JAYA AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE INTERCOMMUNAL 
VIOLENCE IN SULAWESI AND THE MOLUCCAS.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, UN 
SUBJECT: EAST TIMOR: XANANA GUSMAO -- FINALLY -- DECLARES 
CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE HERO XANANA GUSMAO DECLARED 
HIS INTENT TO BECOME THE FIRST-EVER ELECTED PRESIDENT OF 
EAST TIMOR.  WITH LESS THAN 90 MINUTES TO GO BEFORE THE 
FILING DEADLINE EXPIRED, GUSMAO ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION OF 
MINOR OPPOSITION PARTIES TO THE CHAGRIN OF THE MAJORITY 
PARTY FRETILIN.  FRETILIN WANTED GUSMAO TO RUN AS AN 
CANDIDATE INDEPENDENTLY NOMINATED BY 5,000 CITIZENS. 
XANANA NOW PITS HIS POPULARITY AGAINST THE FRETILIN\'S 
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH AND DEEPENS THE PERSONAL WITH 
FRETILIN.  HOWEVER, HE DID OFFER AN OLIVE BRANCH OF SORTS 
BY UNDERLINING THAT HE WOULD CONTINUE HIS STATUS 
INDEPENDENT OF PARTY AFFILIATION AND NOT CAMPAIGN OR 
ENDORSE POLITICIANS FROM AMONG THE PARTIES WHO NOMINATED 
HIM.  XANANA SHOULD CRUISE TO EASY VICTORY AGAINST THE ONLY 
OTHER CANDIDATE IN THE RACE -- THE VENERABLE XAVIER DO 
AMARAL, CURRENTLY THE DEPUTY OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND 
FORMERLY THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF EAST TIMOR IN 1975.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
XANANA OFFICIALLY ENTERS RACE 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE HERO \"XANANA\" GUSMAO OFFICIALLY 
DECLARED HIMSELF A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 23. 
ONLY MINUTES BEFORE THE FILING DEADLINE WAS TO EXPIRE, 
XANANA LET TEN MINORITY POLITICAL PARTIES FORMALLY REGISTER 
HIS CANDIDACY.  THESE PARTIES INCLUDE THE PSD AND PD, THE 
MOST PROMINENT OPPOSITION.  THE TEN SUPPORTING PARTIES SPAN 
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM FROM THE CONSERVATIVE UDT THROUGH 
THE SOCIALIST PARTY. 
 
3.  NOTABLY ABSENT WAS FRETILIN, THE MAJORITY PARTY. 
FRETILIN HAD WANTED GUSMAO TO ESCHEW ALL PARTY NOMINATIONS 
AND RUN BY ACCEPTING A NON-PARTISAN PETITION OF 5,000 
CITIZEN SIGNATURES.  XANANA\'S SUPPORTERS HAD ACTUALLY 
COMPLETED SUCH A PETITION IN TIME FOR GUSMAO\'S USE, BUT HE 
OPTED DIFFERENTLY.  (ONLY ONE OTHER CANDIDATE IS 
REGISTERED, THE ASDT PARTY\'S XAVIER DO AMARAL, THE DEPUTY 
SPEAKER OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY -- AND NO THREAT TO 
GUSMAO\'S CHANCES.) 
 
4.  GUSMAO HAS STEADFASTLY REFUSED THE INDIVIDUAL PETITION 
ROUTE BECAUSE, HE ASSERTS, THAT WOULD MEAN HE WAS HARBORING 
A PERSONAL ASPIRATION  TO BE PRESIDENT.  ALL ALONG, HE HAS 
CLAIMED NO PERSONAL AMBITION.  THUS HE WOULD ONLY ACCEPT 
THE IMPORTUNING OF OTHERS TO FILL THE OFFICE OF CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE.  AT A MORE STRATEGIC LEVEL, XANANA WANTS TO RUN 
AND WIN WITHOUT FRETILIN\'S SUPPORT TO DEMONSTRATE HE IS THE 
ONE WHO ENJOYS THE PEOPLE\'S MANDATE.  WITH SUCH A MANDATE, 
GUSMAO WOULD INCREASE HIS LEVERAGE IN THE POLICY MAKING 
PROCESS, EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE FEW ENUMERATED 
POWERS UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION. 
 
XANANA:  \"NOT AN OPPOSITION CANDIDATE\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  XANANA DID EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH, OF SORTS, TO 
FRETILIN.  HE SAID THAT, IN SPITE OF THE MINOR PARTY 
NOMINATIONS, HE WOULD MAINTAIN A TOTALLY \"INDEPENDENT\" 
POLITICAL POSTURE.  HE WOULD NOT BECOME THE \"OPPOSITION\'S 
PRESIDENT\", NOR JOIN THOSE PARTIES.  XANANA HAS CREATED AN 
UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION TO RAISE FUNDS AND MANAGE HIS 
CAMPAIGN.  SUPPORTERS WILL HAVE TO FORSWEAR FORMAL 
POLITICAL AFFILIATION -- AT LEAST TEMPORARILY -- WHILE 
WORKING FOR HIM. 
 
6.  FRETILIN DOES NOT WANT TO ACTIVELY COUNTER XANANA. THEY 
WANTED TO ENDORSE HIM UNDER THE PETITION SCHEME.  FRETILIN 
IS NOT MONOLITHIC.  THERE IS A LARGE PRO-XANANA FACTION 
WITHIN THE PARTY WHO LIKE HIM AND BELIEVE HE IS THE RIGHT 
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT.   ACCORDING TO A MID-LEVEL 
FRETILIN OFFICIAL, FRETILIN WILL SOLVE ITS DILEMMA BY NOT 
OPPOSING XANANA AND OFFICIALLY REMAINING \"NEUTRAL.\"  THIS 
WOULD FREE PARTY MEMBERS TO GO OUT AND \"VOTE THEIR 
CONSCIENCE.\" 
 
RAMOS HORTA CANNOT BROKER DEAL 
------------------------------ 
 
7.  FOREIGN MINISTER JOSE RAMOS HORTA, THE NOBEL PEACE 
PRIZE WINNER, HAD BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES TO RESOLVE 
MONTHS OF XANANA\'S INDECISION.  RAMOS HORTA HAD WORKED TO 
ARRANGE THE 5,000 SIGNATURES TO DENY XANANA THE EXCUSE THAT 
TIME HAD RUN OUT FOR THAT CANDIDATE OPTION. 
 
8.  FORTY-EIGHT HOURS BEFORE THE REGISTRATION EXPIRY, RAMOS 
HORTA ADVISED SENIOR UNTAET (UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL 
ADMINISTRATION FOR EAST TIMOR) OFFICIALS THAT XANANA HAD 
FINALLY AGREED TO GO THE PETITION ROUTE, ONLY HOURS AFTER 
XANANA HAD INFORMED THE U.S. AMBASSADOR HE WAS LEANING 
TOWARD ACCEPTING THE MINOR PARTY NOMINATIONS -- IF HE 
DECIDED TO RUN. 
 
9.  RAMOS HORTA HAD EVEN WORKED OUT A PLAN IF XANANA DID 
THE UNTHINKABLE AND DECIDED NOT TO RUN.  RAMOS HORTA, 
HIGHLY RESPECTED DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, WOULD 
HAVE ACCEPTED A FRETILIN NOMINATION AND RUN AS NATIONAL 
UNITY CANDIDATE.  ALTHOUGH HE WAS HAPPY ABOUT XANANA\'S 
FINAL DECISION TO STAND AS A CANDIDATE, XANANA\'S LATE 
REVERSAL CONFOUNDED EVEN HORTA. 
 
XANANA AND FRETILIN: A WIDENING GULF? 
------------------------------------- 
 
10.   XANANA GUSMAO\'S REFUSAL TO GO THE PETITION ROUTE WILL 
INCREASE FRICTION BETWEEN HIM AND THE FRETILIN PARTY. 
THERE IS A CURRENTLY A SHARP PERSONAL RIFT BETWEEN GUSMAO 
AND FRETILIN\'S MOST DOMINANT FIGURE, MARI ALKATIRI, WHO IS 
CHIEF MINISTER OF EAST TIMOR\'S SECOND TRANSITIONAL 
GOVERNMENT AND WILL ASCEND TO THE POWERFUL OFFICE OF PRIME 
MINISTER AFTER INDEPENDENCE. 
 
11.  SENIOR OFFICIALS WITHIN UNTAET, WHICH GOVERNS EAST 
TIMOR UNTIL MAY 20, WOULD HAVE PREFERRED XANANA\'S 
ACCEPTANCE OF THE PETITION ROUTE TO AVOID A WIDENING OF THE 
XANANA/FRETILIN BREACH.  FRETILIN WILL DOMINATE THE NEW 
PARLIAMENT AND CABINET.  THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE FEW 
ENUMERATED POWERS AND WILL HAVE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH 
FRETILIN  FOR GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE HARMONIOUSLY. 
OFFICIALS WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND FRETILIN REPORT THAT 
ALKATIRI HAS SOUGHT TO MEET WITH GUSMAO IN RECENT WEEKS 
ONLY TO BE REBUFFED. 
 
12.  COMMENT:  GUSMAO KNOWS HE IS MORE POPULAR THAN 
FRETILIN OR ALKATIRI PERSONALLY.  THIS MAY HAVE LED HIM TO 
IGNORE FRETILIN -- RATHER THAN NEGOTIATE WITH THEM -- ABOUT 
THE TERMS OF HIS CANDIDACY.  ALTHOUGH THIS WILL WORK FOR 
HIM DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IT IS THE WRONG 
PRESCRIPTION FOR ENACTING LEGISLATION OR IMPLEMENTING 
NATIONAL POLICIES POST-MAY 20.  XANANA\'S WAVERING ABOUT HIS 
CANDIDACY HAS BEEN WORTHY OF A PERFORMANCE OF SHAKESPEARE\'S 
\"HAMLET,\" BUT THE UNCERTAINTY INVITES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS 
ROLE AS A DECISIVE OFFICE-HOLDER AFTER AN ELECTION HE IS 
SURE TO WIN.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, UN 
SUBJECT: EAST TIMOR: XANANA GUSMAO WINS PRESIDENCY; 
PLEDGES TO WORK TO FULFILL GOALS 
 
1. SUMMARY.  NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE HERO XANANA GUSMAO 
HAS WON A RESOUNDING VICTORY TO BECOME THE FIRST-EVER 
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF EAST TIMOR.  XANANA WON 83 
PERCENT OF ALL VALID VOTES CAST.  XANANA, WHILE 
MINDFUL OF THE PRESIDENT\'S CONSTITUTIONAL 
LIMITATIONS, INTENDS TO PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN 
MOBILIZING CITIZENS TO IDENTIFY NATIONAL PRIORITIES 
AND RECOMMEND SOLUTIONS.  AS HE TRIES TO LEAD, HE 
MUST MOVE CAREFULLY TO AVOID GIVING THE IMPRESSION 
THAT HE IS TRYING TO USURP POWERS, WHICH LEGITIMATELY 
BELONG TO THE PARLIAMENT AND CABINET.  XANANA 
INDICATED HE WOULD TRY TO TEMPER PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS 
OF GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
LANDSLIDE VICTORY 
----------------- 
 
2.  NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE HERO XANANA GUSMAO HAS WON 
A RESOUNDING VICTORY TO BECOME THE FIRST-EVER, 
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF EAST TIMOR.  XANANA WON 83 
PERCENT OF ALL VALID VOTES TO BEST HIS ONLY OPPONENT, 
FRANCISCO XAVIER DO AMARAL.  EIGHTY-SIX PERCENT OF 
ELIGIBLE VOTERS CAST BALLOTS.  XANANA SHOWED BROAD 
APPEAL.  HE WON EVERY DISTRICT EXCEPT FOR XAVIER\'S 
HOME REGION.  STILL, CONSIDERING XAVIER\'S LIMITED 
RESOURCES AND HIS ILLNESS DURING THE FIRST PART OF 
THE CAMPAIGN, HE MADE A RESPECTABLE SHOWING AGAINST 
THE POPULAR, CHARISMATIC GUSMAO. 
 
3.  XANANA SERVED NOTICE IN HIS VICTORY STATEMENT 
THAT HE WOULD WORK TOWARD HIS GOALS OF AN OPEN 
PRESIDENCY, RECONCILIATION, JOB GROWTH AND FRIENDSHIP 
WITH BIG NEIGHBORS (AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA).  HE 
WILL WORK TO DIRECT THE GOVERNMENT\'S PROGRAMS TOWARD 
PEOPLES\' MOST BASIC NEEDS, AND AT THE SAME TIME 
EXPLAIN GOVERNMENT\'S LIMITATIONS TO THE PEOPLE IN THE 
FACE OF THEIR \"HUGE EXPECTATIONS.\" 
 
CAUTIOUS ON RELATIONS WITH FRETILIN 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  XANANA WAS CAUTIOUS IN ANSWERING REPORTERS\' 
QUERIES ABOUT FRICTION BETWEEN HIM AND THE MAJORITY 
FRETILIN PARTY, WHICH WILL DOMINATE THE CABINET AND 
PARLIAMENT.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED DIFFERENCES WITH 
FRETILIN, BUT TRIED TO DOWNPLAY CONFLICT, UNDERLINING 
THAT EVEN IN THE INDEPENDENCE FIGHT, THERE HAD BEEN 
DIFFERENCES OVER TACTICS. 
 
5.  XANANA WILL CONSULT AND MOBILIZE THE PEOPLE AND 
\"CIVIL SOCIETY\" IN ORDER TO DETERMINE NATIONAL 
PRIORITIES.  XANANA WAS CAREFUL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE 
LIMITED ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, 
BUT NOTED THAT HE WOULD WORK TO HELP THE CABINET 
(\"THE GOVERNMENT\") IMPLEMENT ITS PROGRAMS.  IN AREAS 
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT FELL SHORT OF SOLVING PROBLEMS, 
HE WOULD TRY TO GUIDE THE GOVERNMENT TOWARD 
SOLUTIONS. 
 
6.  XANANA\'S VICTORY POSES A CHALLENGE TO THE 
MAJORITY FRETILIN PARTY AND ITS LEADER, MARI 
ALKATIRI.  XANANA\'S 83 PERCENT TOPS THE 62 PERCENT 
POLLED BY FRETILIN IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.  IT 
IS CLEAR THAT DROVES OF RANK-AND-FILE FRETILIN VOTERS 
ALSO CAST BALLOTS FOR XANANA.  EARLIER IN THE DAY, 
ALKATIRI PUBLICLY CONGRATULATED XANANA\'S VICTORY, BUT 
HE DECLINED TO SAY HE WOULD FORM OR BE PART OF A 
\"GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY.\"  HE REMINDED 
REPORTERS THAT THE CONSTITUTION EMPOWERS THE MAJORITY 
PARTY IN THE ASSEMBLY TO NAME THE PRIME MINISTER, WHO 
THEN APPOINTS MEMBERS TO THE CABINET.  HOWEVER, IN A 
LATER APPEARANCE IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, 
ALKATIRI PLEDGED THAT \"PARLIAMENT, CABINET AND THE 
PRESIDENT\" WOULD WORK TOGETHER. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  XANANA\'S VICTORY STATEMENT SHOWS HE HAS EVERY 
INTENTION OF PLAYING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN EAST TIMOR, 
WHILE RECOGNIZING THE LIMITS THAT THE CONSTITUTION 
PLACES ON PRESIDENTIAL POWER.  AS HE TRIES TO LEAD, 
HE MUST MOVE CAREFULLY TO AVOID GIVING THE IMPRESSION 
THAT HE IS TRYING TO USURP POWERS, WHICH LEGITIMATELY 
BELONG TO THE PARLIAMENT AND CABINET.  AT THE SAME 
TIME, XANANA, MORE THAN ANY OTHER TIMORESE, CAN DO 
THE MOST TO TEMPER THE PUBLIC\'S EXPECTATIONS OF A 
GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS SCARCE RESOURCES TO MEET A 
SERIES OF PRESSING NEEDS.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ID, US 
SUBJECT: RELIGOUS EXTREMISTS SEEKING \"SHORTCUT TO 
PARADISE,\" COORDINATING MINISTER KALLA TELLS A/S KELLY 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF I. REED, REASON 1. 5 (D). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY:  COORDINATING PEOPLE\'S WELFARE MINISTER JUSUF 
KALLA TOLD VISITING EAP A/S JAMES KELLY MAY 18 THAT ECONOMIC 
MARGINALIZATION OF LOCALS WAS THE ROOT CAUSE OF INDONESIA\'S 
COMMUNAL AND SEPARATIST CONFLICTS.  HE DOWNPLAYED THE 
IMPORTANCE OF RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS AND OTHER POWERFUL VESTED 
INTERESTS, CHARACTERIZING THEM MORE AS A SYMPTOM THAN A 
CAUSE. THE GOI\'S APPROACH TO SOLVING THE CONFLICTS, KALLA 
SAID, WOULD BE TO REDUCE POVERTY AND IMPROVE HEALTH, 
EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, WHILE LEAVING 
\"THE REST\" TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  IN A LAND WHERE FEAR OF 
RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS AND UNSEEN MALEVOLENT FORCES OFTEN 
STYMIES ACTION, KALLA\'S EMPHASIS ON ECONOMICS AND GOVERNMENT 
SERVICES WAS REFRESHING, AND MAY HELP EXPLAIN WHY HIS 
POLITICAL STAR IS RISING.  AS USUAL, THE HARD PART WILL BE 
FOLLOW-THROUGH.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) COORDINATING MINISTER FOR PEOPLE\'S WELFARE JUSUF KALLA 
DISCUSSED INDONESIA\'S SEPARATIST AND COMMUNAL CONFLICTS AND 
OTHER ISSUES UNDER HIS SUPERVISION IN A MAY 18 MEETING WITH 
VISITING EAP ASSISTANT SECRETARY JAMES KELLY, ACCOMPANIED BY 
CHARGE.  PRIVATE SECRETARY SUTEDJO JUWONO, GENERAL ELECTIONS 
COMMISSIONER HAMID AWALUDIN, AND A NOTETAKER JOINED MINISTER 
KALLA.  EAP SENIOR ADVISOR THERESA MCNIEL, USAID DIRECTOR, 
CONTROL OFFICER LISA WILKINSON, AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) ALSO 
ACCOMPANIED A/S KELLY. 
 
IT\'S THE ECONOMY 
---------------- 
4. (C) A/S KELLY THANKED KALLA FOR HIS AND THE GOI\'S EFFORTS 
TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO CONFLICTS IN MALUKU AND CENTRAL 
SULAWESI, WHICH THE USG STRONGLY SUPPORTED.   KALLA TOLD A/S 
KELLY THAT ECONOMIC MARGINALIZATION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES WAS 
THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL OF INDONESIA\'S COMMUNAL AND SEPARATIST 
CONFLICTS.  HE TRACED THIS PHENOMENON TO SOEHARTO-ERA GOI 
POLICIES, IN PARTICULAR THE GRANTING OF MONOPOLIES OVER KEY 
COMMODITIES -- INCLUDING CLOVES, TIMBER, COFFEE, AND CANE FOR 
FURNITURE -- TO CRONIES OF THE RULING ELITE, THUS SHUTTING 
LOCAL COMMUNITIES OUT OF THE BENEFITS.  MEANWHILE, 
TRANSMIGRATION POLICIES HAD CREATED RESENTMENT BY HELPING TO 
DISPLACE LOCALS WITH HARDER WORKING MIGRANTS. 
 
5. (C) KALLA NOTED THAT THE ADVENT OF DEMOCRACY HAD ALSO 
HELPED UNRAVEL ONCE CAREFULLY MANAGED BALANCES OF POWER 
BETWEEN RELIGIOUS GROUPS.  IN REGIONS SUCH AS CENTRAL 
SULAWESI AND MALUKU, WHERE GROUPS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES 
WERE LARGE OR POPULATIONS WERE ROUGHLY BALANCED, THE 
GOVERNMENT PARCELED OUT IMPORTANT POSITIONS AS GOVERNORS OR 
DISTRICT HEADS ACCORDING TO TRADITIONS THAT REFLECTED THE 
STRENGTH OF EACH RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY.  CURRENTLY, WHICHEVER 
SIDE MUSTERED A MAJORITY IN THE LOCAL LEGISLATURE COULD FILL 
THE POSITIONS OVERWHELMINGLY WITH MEMBERS OF ITS OWN 
COMMUNITY. 
 
6. (C) IN THE CASE OF MALUKU, HISTORIC IMBALANCES IN 
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WERE ALSO A FACTOR, KALLA SAID. 
CHRISTIANS WERE FAR BETTER EDUCATED DURING THE COLONIAL 
PERIOD, BUT LATER MOVED TO JAKARTA SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES. 
MUSLIMS REPLACED THEM IN IMPORTANT POSITIONS, WHERE THEY NOW 
DOMINATED.  KALLA NOTED, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT FIFTEEN OF 
NINETEEN HEADS OF DEPARTMENT IN THE AMBON ADMINISTRATION WERE 
NOW MUSLIM, EVEN THOUGH THE POPULATIONS OF THE TWO 
COMMUNITIES WERE ROUGHLY BALANCED. 
 
EXTREMISTS ON ICE 
----------------- 
7. (C) THE CHARGE ASKED FOR KALLA\'S VIEWS ON A RECENT MEDIA 
DEBATE THAT FOLLOWED THE ARREST OF LASKAR JIHAD LEADER JAFFAR 
UMAR THALIB OVER WHETHER EXTREMIST GROUPS WERE REALLY THE 
MAIN SOURCE OF PROBLEMS.  KALLA DOWNPLAYED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
SUCH GROUPS OR OFTEN-RUMORED PROVOCATION FROM OTHER POWERFUL 
VESTED INTERESTS, SUGGESTING THEY WERE A SYMPTOM MORE THAN A 
CAUSE OF THE CONFLICTS.  RETRACING THE HISTORY OF MALUKU, HE 
CLAIMED THAT IT STARTED AS A COMMUNAL CONFLICT RESULTING FROM 
ECONOMIC MARGINALIZATION OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, AND THAT 
FOR THE FIRST YEAR THE CHRISTIANS WERE MORE AGGRESSIVE.  IN 
AN EFFORT TO TIP THE BALANCE, LASKAR JIHAD (LJ) BEGAN 
MOBILIZING MUSLIMS FROM JAVA TO AMBON SIX MONTHS LATER, 
GAINING FINANCIAL SUPPORT BY HIGHLIGHTING ITS HEALTH AND 
HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS.  SIX MONTHS LATER, THE CHRISTIAN SIDE 
PRODUCED THE MALUKU SOVEREIGNTY FRONT (FKM). 
 
8. (C) KALLA CLAIMED THAT THIS SEQUENCE EXPLAINED WHY THE GOI 
HAD FOCUSED FIRST ON REPAIRING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES DURING THE MALINO I AND II PROCESSES (AGREEMENTS 
STRUCK EARLIER THIS YEAR INTENDED TO SETTLE THE CENTRAL 
SULAWESI AND MALUKU CONFLICTS, RESPECTIVELY).  HE SUGGESTED 
THAT THAT EFFORT HAD BEEN LARGELY SUCCESSFUL, NOTING THAT A 
RECENT OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE IN MALUKU HAD INVOLVED ONLY 
MILITIAS AND NOT LOCAL PEOPLE.  THE GOI HAD SUBSEQUENTLY 
ARRESTED LJ LEADER THALIB AND THE FKM\'S LEADER REMAINED IN 
DETENTION, HE ADDED.  KALLA PREDICTED THE SITUATION IN MALUKU 
WOULD IMPROVE IN JUNE, ALLUDING TO A DEADLINE (OFTEN EXTENDED 
PREVIOUSLY) FOR OUTSIDE COMBATANTS TO WITHDRAW.  KELLY 
QUESTIONED WHETHER AN IMPROVING SECURITY SITUATION NATIONWIDE 
INDICATED THAT COMMUNAL CONFLICTS WERE A \"SPENT FORCE\" AND 
WHETHER CONFLICT AREAS WOULD REMAIN PEACEFUL AFTER SECURITY 
FORCES WERE WITHDRAWN. 
 
SEEKING \"SHORTCUT TO PARADISE\" 
------------------------------ 
9. (C) KALLA SUGGESTED THAT SEPARATIST CONFLICTS WERE EASIER 
TO RESOLVE THAN THOSE WITH RELIGIOUS OVERTONES.  THE 
RELIGIOUS MILITIAS INCLUDED MANY THUGS WHO SOUGHT A \"SHORTCUT 
TO PARADISE\" PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PARTICULARLY 
RELIGIOUS.  CONVINCED THAT HEAVEN WAS ON THEIR SIDE IN A 
RELIGIOUS WAR, THESE COMBATANTS WERE UNAFRAID TO DIE.  SINCE 
CHARITY ALSO EARNED ONE CREDIT TO GET INTO HEAVEN, THERE WERE 
MANY PEOPLE, INCLUDING FROM OUTSIDE OF INDONESIA, EAGER TO 
GIVE LASKAR JIHAD MONEY.  KALLA SAID HE HAD TOLD MILITIA 
MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES THAT THIS WAS NOT A LEGITIMATE 
RELIGIOUS WAR, AND THAT THEIR ACTIONS WOULD LIKELY EARN THEM 
A TRIP TO HELL. 
 
10. (C) THE SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS IN ACEH AND WEST PAPUA 
REMAINED LARGELY BASED ON ECONOMIC GRIEVANCES, KALLA 
SUGGESTED, WHILE COMPARING THE STUBBORN RESISTANCE OF THE 
ACEHNESE TO THAT OF THE APACHE INDIANS.  WEST PAPUA WOULD BE 
EASIER TO RESOLVE, HE ARGUED, AS THE NEW SPECIAL AUTONOMY LAW 
TRANSFERRED GREATER CONTROL OF POLITICS AND ECONOMIC 
RESOURCES TO THE LOCAL PEOPLE.  THE FEARLESSNESS OF HOLY 
WARRIORS MADE RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS FAR BLOODIER, KALLA NOTED, 
CLAIMING THAT THE ESTIMATED FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE KILLED IN 
THE MALUKU CONFLICT OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS WAS TEN TIMES 
THE DEATH TOLL IN ACEH.  (NOTE:  KALLA\'S ESTIMATE OF THE ACEH 
DEAD APPEARS TO BE A SERIOUS UNDERESTIMATE, WITH THE DEATH 
TOLL SO FAR THIS YEAR ALREADY APPROACHING FOUR HUNDRED.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
11. (C) A/S KELLY THANKED KALLA FOR HIS EFFORTS IN BROKERING 
THE MALINO AGREEMENTS AND IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE COUNTRY\'S 
PROBLEMS WITH INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDP\'S).  HE 
REITERATED THAT THE UNITED STATES STRONGLY SUPPORTED 
INDONESIA\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, AND NOTED THAT HIS DEPUTY 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY, MATHEW DALEY, HAD VISITED GAM LEADERS IN 
STOCKHOLM THIS MONTH TO URGE THAT THEY ACCEPT THE ACEH 
SPECIAL AUTONOMY LAW AS A BASIS FOR A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT. 
 
12. (C) KALLA SAID THE IDP PROBLEM WOULD BECOME EASIER TO 
SOLVE AS SECURITY IMPROVED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  NOTING 
THAT HE WOULD ACCOMPANY PRESIDENT MEGAWATI TO EAST TIMOR\'S 
MAY 19 INDEPENDENCE CELEBRATION, KALLA PROJECTED THAT AS MANY 
AS FOUR-FIFTHS OF THE REMAINING FIFTY THOUSAND IDP\'S IN WEST 
TIMOR MIGHT RETURN HOME BY AUGUST.  A/S KELLY PRAISED 
MEGAWATI\'S DECISION TO ATTEND THE CELEBRATION, NOTING THAT 
SHE TOOK A POLITICAL RISK IN DOING SO BUT THAT IT WOULD HELP 
ENCOURAGE IDP\'S TO RETURN. 
 
THE SOLUTION -- ENDING POVERTY, IMPROVING EDUCATION 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
13. (C) KALLA STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF POVERTY REDUCTION IN 
RESOLVING ALL OF INDONESIA\'S SEPARATIST AND COMMUNAL 
CONFLICTS.  THE GOI WOULD FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON IMPROVING 
HEALTH, EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES AND BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE, 
WHILE LEAVING \"THE REST TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.\"  OVER THE 
LONGER TERM, THE GOI HAD TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO 
ADDRESS BOTH ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM. 
 
14. (C) A/S KELLY ASKED ABOUT OTHER ISSUES TOUCHING ON 
KALLA\'S AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, INCLUDING HEALTH AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT.  KALLA RESPONDED THAT IN ITS APPROACH TO HEALTH 
CARE, THE GOI WAS RETURNING TO THE TRADITION OF HAVING 
CLINICS IN EACH VILLAGE STAFFED AT MINIMUM WITH A NURSE 
CAPABLE OF DOING IMMUNIZATIONS.  KALLA DOWNPLAYED CONCERNS 
ABOUT AN EL NINO-INDUCED DROUGHT THIS YEAR, SAYING HE WAS 
CONFIDENT THAT STOCKS OF RICE WERE SUFFICIENT TO AVOID A 
LARGE-SCALE DISASTER.  RECALLING JAKARTA\'S SEVERE FLOODS 
EARLY THIS YEAR, KALLA NOTED THAT FLOODS COULD BE AS 
DANGEROUS AS DROUGHT. 
 
15. (C) KALLA POINTED OUT THAT DURING INDONESIA\'S 1998 
ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS, IT HAD NOT BEEN DROUGHT BUT RATHER 
ACCOMPANYING FOREST FIRES THAT HAD DONE THE MOST DAMAGE. 
KALLA SUGGESTED THE RISK OF A REPETITION OF EL NINO MAY 
NEARLY HAVE PASSED, AS MAY AND JUNE TENDED TO BE THE DRIEST 
MONTHS.  A/S KELLY ASKED KALLA ABOUT THE CONDITION OF 
INDONESIA\'S CORAL REEFS.  THE MINISTER ASSERTED THAT 
FISHERMEN ARE BETTER TRAINED THAN PREVIOUSLY TO AVOID 
DYNAMITE FISHING, BUT THAT THE GOI NEEDED MORE CAPACITY TO 
POLICE ITS WATERS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16. (C) SOURCES SAY THAT KALLA, WITH HIS BUSINESS BACKGROUND, 
APPROACHES HIS JOB WITH A CAN-DO ATTITUDE THAT BORDERS ON 
NAIVETE.  BUT HIS EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT IS 
REFRESHING IN A PLACE WHERE EVERY UNFORTUNATE EVENT IS SEEN 
AS THE WORK OF MALEVOLENT AND UNSEEN HANDS, WHOSE FEARED 
POWER THEN BECOMES AN EXCUSE FOR INACTION.  THE PRESENCE OF 
LASKAR JIHAD IN MALUKU IS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO PEACE, AND 
THE REAL REASON THE GOI HAS NOT EVICTED THEM IS FEAR OF AN 
ISLAMIST POLITICAL BACKLASH.  BUT KALLA IS RIGHT TO KEEP THE 
MILITIAS AND RUMORS OF MILITARY PROVOCATEURS INTO 
PERSPECTIVE.  THE GOI MUST LEARN HOW TO HANDLE THE LIKES OF 
LASKAR JIHAD, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.  MEANWHILE, A LOT 
COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IF THE GOI STARTED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON 
KALLA\'S OWN PRESCRIPTION: POVERTY REDUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS 
TO HEALTH, EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES, AND INFRASTRUCTURE, 
AND PRIVATE SECTOR COMPETITION. 
 
17. (U) A/S KELLY HAS CLEARED THIS MESSAGE.

U.S.MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ 
 
REF: JAKARTA 3305 
 
INDONESIAN PRESIDENT MEGAWATI SOEKARNOPUTRI, FOLLOWING A 
MARCH 20 CABINET MEETING, ISSUED A STATEMENT ENTITLED 
\"INDONESIA STRONGLY DEPLORES UNILATERAL ACTION AGAINST IRAQ\" 
(REFTEL).  THE STATEMENT FOLLOWED TWO DAYS OF CALLS BY 
POLITICAL OPPONENTS, CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS, AND MUSLIM 
ORGANIZATIONS FOR A STRONGER INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 
TO ANTICIPATED AND NOW ON-GOING U.S.-LED MILITARY ACTION. 
THE PRESIDENT NOTED IN THE STATEMENT THAT \"SYMPATHY (FOR THE 
IRAQI PEOPLE) SHOULD BE EXPRESSED IN A PEACEFUL AND 
DEMOCRATIC MANNER...A MANNER THAT SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE PUBLIC 
ORDER AND OUR NATIONAL STABILITY....\"  THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE 
RELEASED THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEXT, REPEATED IN FULL BELOW. 
 
(BEGIN TEXT) 
 
INDONESIA STRONGLY DEPLORES UNILATERAL ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 
 
-- 1.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA STRONGLY 
DEPLORE THE UNILATERAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES THAT HAVE DECIDED TO 
GO TO WAR AGAINST IRAQ.  INDONESIA DEEPLY REGRETS THAT THE 
MULTILATERAL PROCESS THROUGH THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL HAS BEEN 
SIDELINED.  INDONESIA IS OF THE VIEW THAT THE USE OF MILITARY 
FORCE AGAINST IRAQ BASED ON THE UNILATERAL DECISION 
CONSTITUTES AN ACT OF AGGRESSION WHICH IS IN CONTRAVENTION TO 
INTERNATIONAL LAW.  THIS UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION HAS ALSO 
THREATENED THE WORLD ORDER. 
 
-- 2.  WAR WILL NOT ONLY FAIL TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, BUT IT 
WILL ALSO CAUSE HUMANITARIAN TRAGEDY.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE 
PEOPLE OF INDONESIA ARE GRAVELY CONCERNED OVER THE INNOCENT 
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AND THE IMMENSE MATERIAL LOSSES THAT MAY 
RESULT FROM THIS MILITARY ACTION.  THE WAR WILL BRING 
NEGATIVE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IMPACTS TO THE MIDDLE EAST 
REGION AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING INDONESIA. 
 
-- 3.  THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ITS DIPLOMATIC 
EFFORTS BOTH BILATERALLY AND THROUGH INTERNATIONAL FORA SUCH 
AS ASEAN, THE NON ALIGNED MOVEMENT, THE ORGANIZATION OF 
ISLAMIC CONFERENCE, AND THE UNITED NATIONS, HAS CONSISTENTLY 
STRESSED THE NEED TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE IRAQI 
CRISIS.  THESE EFFORTS HAVE EVEN BEEN STRENGTHENED BY PEACE 
MISSIONS OF THE INDONESIAN INTER-FAITH LEADERS TO SEVERAL 
COUNTRIES AS WELL AS BY THE REPEATED CALL FOR PEACE FROM ALL 
SEGMENTS OF THE INDONESIAN NATION.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
EARLIER ESTABLISHED \"THE NATIONAL TEAM TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT 
OF THE IRAQI CRISIS\" IN ORDER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDONESIAN NATIONALS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
AS WELL AS TO ANTICIPATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TOWARDS INDONESIA. 
 
-- 4.  THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA DEMANDS THE UNITED NATIONS 
SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY, TO IMMEDIATELY CONVENE IN 
AN EMERGENCY MEETING IN ORDER TO URGE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES TO IMMEDIATELY STOP THE WAR AND 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ITS 
ALLIES TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO OVERCOME THE HUMANITARIAN ASPECTS 
RESULTING FROM THE CONFLICT SITUATION.  SHOULD THE EFFORTS BY 
THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL COME TO A DEAD-LOCK, INDONESIA WILL 
URGE THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO CONVENE IN AN EMERGENCY 
SESSION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK OF THE \"UNITING FOR PEACE\" 
RESOLUTION. 
 
-- 5.  THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO 
AVOID THE FURTHER DESTABILIZATION OF THE MIDDLE EAST REGION. 
THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO STRESSES THAT ANY SOLUTION TO 
THE QUESTION OF IRAQ SHOULD RESPECT THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY 
AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF IRAQ. 
 
-- 6.  THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA CALLS ON ALL INDONESIAN 
NATIONALS WITHIN THE VICINITY OF IRAQ TO REMAIN CALM AND 
REPORT TO THE NEAREST INDONESIAN MISSIONS FOR ANY NECESSARY 
ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION. 
 
-- 7.  THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA FULLY SHARES THE 
OUTPOURING OF ANTI-WAR CALLS AND SYMPATHY FROM THE INDONESIAN 
PEOPLE TOWARDS THE PLIGHT OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  SUCH SYMPATHY 
SHOULD BE EXPRESSED IN A PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC MANNER AS IN 
A MANNER THAT SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE PUBLIC ORDER AND OUR 
NATIONAL STABILITY  --- AND BY MAINTAINING OUR NATIONAL UNITY 
AND INTEGRITY.

THAT HE HOPED FOR THE \"INVISIBLE HAND OF GOD\" TO SAVE THE 
ACEH PEACE PROCESS.  YUDHOYONO SAID THE WINDOW IS STILL OPEN 
FOR DIALOGUE AND HE PRAYS FOR A BREAKTHROUGH.  THE AMBASSADOR 
LOBBIED YUDHOYONO TO POSTPONE THE WITHDRAWAL OF INTERNATIONAL 
MONITORS AND TO RECONSIDER THE ARREST OF THREE GAM JOINT

HAND OF GOD?

3. (C) COORDINATING MINISTER FOR POLITICAL AND SECURITY 
AFFAIRS SUSILO BAMBANG YUDHOYONO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR MAY 9 
THAT HE HOPED FOR \"AN INVISIBLE HAND OF GOD\" TO SAVE THE ACEH 
PEACE PROCESS.  YUDHOYONO SAID THAT THE WINDOW FOR A 
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION REMAINED OPEN.  HE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT 
MEGAWATI HAD ENDORSED THE EFFORT OF A GROUP OF ACEHNESE 
PARLIAMENTARIANS TO LOBBY GAM TO BE FLEXIBLE.  YUDHOYONO 
INFERRED FROM THE PRESIDENT\'S ENDORSEMENT OF THIS EFFORT THAT 
THERE WAS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT RENEWED MILITARY 
OPERATIONS COULD BE AVOIDED.  YUDHOYONO SAID HE PRAYED FOR A 
BREAKTHROUGH. 
 
YUDHOYONO PUSHES ZINNI MISSION 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) YUDHOYONO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE HAD PRAISED THE 
ZINNI MISSION TO STOCKHOLM WITH PRESIDENT MEGAWATI.  HE WENT 
ON TO TELL HER THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE U.S., JAPAN AND EU 
HAVE \"ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR INDONESIA.\"  HE DID NOT DESCRIBE 
MEGAWATI\'S REACTION. 
 
AMBASSADOR PRESSES ON WITHDRAWAL, ARRESTS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THE CONFLICTING SIGNALS THAT THE 
CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DIALOGUE (HDC), WHICH HAS BEEN 
BROKERING THE ACEH PEACE AGREEMENT, WAS RECEIVING ABOUT THE 
WITHDRAWAL OF JSC INTERNATIONAL MONITORS.  YUDHOYONO SAID HIS 
OFFICE WAS PREPARING A LETTER INSTRUCTING HDC TO WITHDRAW ALL 
INTERNATIONAL STAFF ON SUNDAY, MAY 11.  THE AMBASSADOR 
PRESSED YUDHOYONO TO POSTPONE THE WITHDRAWAL UNTIL THE 
RESULTS OF THE ZINNI MISSION COULD BE ABSORBED, STRESSING 
THAT EVEN THE GOI\'S OWN DEADLINE EXTENDED UNTIL MAY 12. 
YUDHOYONO REPLIED THAT THE AMBASSADOR\'S REQUEST SEEMED QUITE 
REASONABLE AND PROMISED TO SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE TO 
ACCOMMODATE IT.  YUDHOYONO ADDED THAT HDC STAFF NOT PART OF 
THE FORMAL JSC STRUCTURE COULD STAY \"FOR A FEW DAYS\" OR MAYBE 
LONGER.  (NOTE:  WE LATER RECEIVED A REPORT THAT YUDHOYONO\'S 
OFFICE IN FACT SENT THE LETTER INSTRUCTING HDC TO WITHDRAW ON 
SUNDAY.  AS OF 1930 THE SITUATION WAS STILL UNCLEAR.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
6. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED THE COORDINATING MINISTER IF HE 
WAS AWARE OF THE MAY 9 ARRESTS OF THREE OF FIVE GAM 
REPRESENTATIVES TO THE JSC\'S BANDA ACEH HEADQUARTERS, TEUNGKU 
KAMARRUZAMAN, AMRI, AND AMNI.  YUDHOYONO ACKNOWLEDGED THE 
ARRESTS AND NOTED THAT THE THREE MAY HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO 
DEPART INDONESIA WITHOUT THE PROPER DOCUMENTATION.  THE 
AMBASSADOR REMINDED YUDHOYONO THAT THE COHA REMAINED IN 
EFFECT AND THAT DETAINING THE THREE WOULD SEND A NEGATIVE 
SIGNAL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THE AMBASSADOR URGED 
THE GOI TO RELEASE THREE ARRESTED GAM MEMBERS.  YUDHOYONO 
SAID THAT HE WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATTER AND ENSURE THE THREE 
WERE TREATED STRICTLY ACCORDING TO LAW. 
 
COMMENT: DIVINE INTERVENTION? 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (C) THOUGH YUDHOYONO\'S PRAYERS FOR DIVINE INTERVENTION ARE 
HEARTWARMING AND NO DOUBT GENUINE, THIS MAY BE A CASE OF 
ACEH\'S BEING TOO FAR FROM GOD AND TOO CLOSE TO INDONESIA.  WE 
STILL REGARD A MILITARY OFFENSIVE AS NEARLY INEVITABLE.  ONLY 
A DRAMATIC GESTURE BY THE GAM TO ACCEPT SPECIAL AUTONOMY AND 
TURN IN ITS WEAPONS ON JAKARTA\'S TERMS, WHICH APPEARS 
UNLIKELY, COULD FORESTALL THE GOI\'S RETURN TO A MILITARY 
OPERATION IN ACEH.  THAT BEING SAID, WHEN THE STAKES ARE THIS 
HIGH, LONG SHOTS ARE WORTH PURSUING, ESPECIALLY IF HEAVEN MAY 
LEND A HAND.

SUBJECT: INDONESIA: 2003 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: A. STATE 301352 
     B. 02 JAKARTA 6779 
 
A) Significant Action in Support of the Global Coalition 
Against Terrorism 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
1. Indonesia significantly increased its support for the 
global coalition against terrorism during this period.  The 
October 12, 2002 bombing in Bali that killed 202 - including 
88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, 28 Britons, and seven 
Americans galvanized the Indonesian Government into action, 
and the August 5 bombing of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta 
that killed 12, including 11 Indonesians, further cemented 
Jakarta\'s new resolve.  Since then, the Government, led by 
the Indonesian National Police, has taken effective steps to 
counter the threat posed by the regional terror group that 
calls itself Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and has ties to Al Qaeda. 
The Indonesian police have reported the arrest of 109 
suspected JI members as of late November, including suspects 
in the Bali attacks, the Marriott attack and other criminal 
acts linked to terrorism.  Almost all of those arrests 
occurred during 2003, and included numerous senior leaders, 
most of the masterminds of the Bali bombing, several key 
planners of the Marriott bombing and a number of JI cell 
members, sub-regional (wakalah) and regional (mantiqi) 
commanders, former instructors at JI training camps in the 
southern Philippines and in Afghanistan, and financiers of 
attacks. 
 
2. Indonesia\'s weak rule of law, poorly regulated financial 
system and serious internal coordination problems have 
impeded progress uncovering and freezing terrorist assets. 
Indonesia has not yet frozen any terrorist assets, 
notwithstanding Jakarta\'s continued statements of willingness 
to freeze terrorist assets, consistent with the requirements 
of UNSCR 1267, 1373, 1390, and 1455.  Indonesia did, however, 
enhance its legal framework, passing amendments to its 
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Law in September 2003.  The 
amendments not only brought Indonesia\'s legislation up to 
international standards, but also strengthened the GOI\'s 
legal authority to combat terrorist finance.  A financial 
intelligence unit is now up and running with considerable USG 
assistance.  Continued assistance will be required to improve 
operational effectiveness. 
 
3. The Indonesian military cooperated to a large extent with 
flight clearance requests from the U.S. and other countries 
related to the war against terrorism last year.  The 
Indonesian military also has cooperated in the protection 
from terrorists of high value shipping in the Malacca 
Straits.  Other than limited military intelligence support, 
the Indonesian armed forces have not played a major role in 
the investigation of the Bali or JW Marriott bombings. 
 
4. In March, parliament adopted into law two presidential 
decrees on terrorism from 2002, now laws 15/2003 and 16/2003. 
 Law 15/2003 is a comprehensive anti-terrorism law, defining 
various acts of terror, and providing police and prosecutors 
with broader powers to combat terrorism such as extended 
pre-trial detention periods and the use of electronic 
evidence in court.  Law 16/2003 makes law 15/2003 retroactive 
to the date of the Bali bombings.  As of December 1, the 
Department of Justice and Human Rights was preparing a 
revision of Law 15/2003 to present to parliament.  The 
revision would slightly broaden powers given to police and 
prosecutors, and would reportedly give the Indonesian 
military (TNI) a larger role in counter-terrorism efforts. 
In November, the newly formed Constitutional Court agreed to 
conduct a judicial review of Law 16/2003 which the Bali 
bombers\' defense attorneys had claimed was unconstitutional, 
violating article 28(i) of the amended 1945 Constitution 
which prohibits \"laws with retroactive effect.\" 
 
B) Response of the Judicial System to Acts of Terrorism 
Including Prosecutions 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5. The Indonesian judicial system undertook the trials of 
approximately 63 terror suspects during the year, including 
17 members of the radical Laskar Jundullah organization for 
involvement in the bombing of a McDonalds restaurant and a 
car showroom in Makassar, South Sulawesi in December 2002, 
and 46 members of JI for involvement in the Christmas Eve 
2000 church bombings, the bombing of the Philippine 
Ambassador\'s residence in Jakarta in August 2000, and the 
Bali and Marriott hotel bombings.  As of December 1, 
Indonesian courts had convicted 50 terror suspects, and 
acquitted two.  Fifteen trials remained underway, and many 
more JI suspects were said to be awaiting trial. 
 
6. On September 2, the Central Jakarta District Court 
convicted the leader, or \"Emir\" of JI, Abu Bakar Ba\'asyir, on 
treason and immigration charges.  The panel of judges stated 
in its decision that prosecutors had presented sufficient 
evidence so as to convince them of JI\'s existence, its goal 
of overthrowing the government of Indonesia, and Ba\'asyir\'s 
involvement with the group.  However, despite 
video-conference testimony from JI detainees in Singapore and 
Malaysia as well as testimony from Bali bombers naming 
Ba\'asyir as head of the JI, judges were not convinced of his 
leadership role, and sentenced him to only four years in 
prison.  Both Ba\'asyir and the prosecution appealed the 
decision, and the Jakarta High Court is expected to rule on 
the appeal in December. 
 
7. Indonesian courts have convicted 39 suspects for 
involvement in planning and carrying out the October 12, 2002 
Bali bombings or for aiding and abetting those responsible 
for the attacks.  The Denpasar District Court handed down 29 
of those convictions, and sentenced key Bali bombers Amrozi 
bin Nurhasyim, Abdul Ghoni (a.k.a. Mukhlas) and Abdul Aziz 
(a.k.a. Imam Samudra) to death.  Other suspects standing 
trial in Denpasar and Lamongan received sentences ranging 
from three years to life in prison.  Four trials remained 
underway in Denpasar at year\'s end, with four more underway 
in Palu, Central Sulawesi and two still underway in Lamongan, 
East Java.  At least 15 of those convicted filed appeals.  As 
of December 1, the Bali High Court had quashed 12 of the 
appeals, including those by Amrozi and Imam Samudra, both of 
whom subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court.  The 
numerous convictions and tough sentences handed down by the 
Bali courts are a reflection of the Government\'s seriousness 
in combating terrorism, and its commitment to bringing to 
justice those implicated in terrorist attacks in Indonesia. 
 
8. The Makassar District Court held the trials of 17 suspects 
in connection to the December 5, 2002 bombing of a McDonalds 
restaurant and a car showroom in the South Sulawesi 
provincial capital.  Many of the suspects were believed to be 
members of the radical Laskar Jundullah organization, and 
admitted to having trained at camps in the Southern 
Philippines.  Some were friends or acquaintances of Bali 
bombers.  As of December 1, the court had reportedly 
convicted ten suspects and acquitted one.  Several trials 
remained underway, and two suspects were awaiting trial. 
 
9. The first trial in connection to the August 5 bombing of 
the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta began on November 12 in 
Bengkulu, Sumatra.  The suspect, Sardona Siliwangi, stood 
accused of storing explosives used in the attack, which 
killed 12 people and injured 150 others.  At least ten 
additional Marriott bombing suspects are expected to stand 
trial beginning in December or early 2004, including Bali and 
Marriott bombing suspects Mohamed Rais and Idris (a.k.a. 
Jhoni Hendrawan). 
 
10. Other JI figures stood trial during the year, including 
Abdul Jabar bin Ahmad Kandai, who a Jakarta court convicted 
of planning and carrying out the August 2000 bombing of the 
Philippine Ambassador\'s residence in Jakarta as well as 
participating in the Christmas Eve bombing of a number of 
Jakarta churches that same year.  The Central Jakarta 
District Court sentenced Jabar to 20 years in prison after he 
admitted his involvement in the attacks. 
 
11. Indonesian police conducted a credible first phase of 
investigation into the August 31, 2002 ambush of an 
international mining company\'s contract employees near 
Tembagapura and Timika in Papua province, which killed two 
Americans and one Indonesian and wounded ten others.  The 
investigation uncovered indications of possible involvement 
by Indonesian military members.  Due to limits on its legal 
jurisdiction, the police handed the investigation over to 
military authorities.  Since January, the Indonesian police 
and military have been cooperating with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to solve the case. 
 
 
C) Extraditions or Requested Extraditions of Suspected 
Terrorists 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
12. Jakarta did not extradite or request the extradition of 
suspected terrorists for prosecution during the year, but did 
request the United States provide access to and eventually 
render JI operations chief and Indonesian citizen Riduan 
Isamuddin (a.k.a. Hambali). 
 
 
D) Significant Impediments to Prosecution/Extradition of 
Suspected Terrorists 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
13. There are no significant legal barriers to prosecuting 
domestic terror acts under the existing criminal code, and 
Parliament\'s adoption into law of two anti-terrorism decrees 
in March further strengthened the legal framework in place 
for bringing terrorists to justice. 
 
14. However, the Government has been unwilling to ban JI, 
saying the organization never formally applied for 
recognition and thus cannot be prohibited.  The absence of 
such a prohibition has impeded police and prosecutors in 
arresting and trying suspected terrorists.  Police have had 
to release a number of known JI members for lack of evidence 
tying them to specific criminal or terrorist acts.  As JI\'s 
intellectual leaders begin to stand trial, the apparent 
non-status of JI in Indonesia will likely further hamper 
prosecutors\' efforts to put the organization\'s leaders behind 
bars. 
 
15. Although Indonesian courts have convicted 50 people on 
charges of terrorism, a dearth of prosecutors familiar with 
the structure and inner workings of JI has hampered efforts 
to successfully prosecute suspected terrorists.  Senior 
officials at the Attorney General\'s Office are aware of the 
challenges they face, and are coordinating with police to 
educate prosecutors handling terrorism trials and ensure 
solid cases are made against terror suspects. 
 
16. The Constitution does not prohibit the extradition of 
suspected terrorists.  Indonesia has extradition treaties 
with only five countries (Australia, Malaysia, Philippines, 
South Korea and Thailand) and an agreement for \"surrender of 
fugitive offenders\" with the Special Administrative Region 
(SAR) of Hong Kong.  Indonesia does not have an extradition 
treaty with the United States. 
 
 
E) Responses Other than Prosecution, and Efforts to 
Investigate Terror Incidents or Assist With International 
Terror Investigations 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
17. Senior officials, starting with the President, 
strengthened their public statements on terrorism during 
2003.  Before the Bali bombings in 2002, only a small cadre 
of government officials spoke publicly about the need to 
confront terrorism in Indonesia, while most senior officials 
remained reluctant. As a democratic country with almost 200 
million Muslims, most senior politicians shied away from even 
acknowledging the existence of domestic Islamic terrorists 
for fear of angering a large constituency.  The suicide car 
bombing in Bali that killed 202, mostly foreigners, in two 
nightclubs on the night of October 12, 2002, was a watershed. 
 The bloody attack forced the Indonesians to confront this 
long-denied problem.  Two months later, terrorists bombed a 
McDonald\'s restaurant and a Toyota showroom in Makassar, the 
largest city on the island of Sulawesi.  JI\'s bombing of the 
JW Marriott hotel in Jakarta in August 2003 again shocked 
Indonesians, both because of the mostly Indonesian 
casualties, and because the attack occurred in the capital 
city. 
 
18. The public comments of senior officials have, for the 
most part, reflected the government\'s shift to a tougher 
attitude on terrorism.  In late September, for example, 
Indonesian President Megawati said that despite public 
protests, her government would continue to take preemptive 
measures against terrorism in Indonesia and keep hard-line 
groups under surveillance.  The Indonesian National Police 
have been by far the most active in trying to convince the 
public of the need to resist the JI and countering public 
statements from various religious leaders denying the 
existence of the JI terror group and who attribute bombings 
in Indonesia to outsiders.  In late September, police 
organized meetings with religious leaders both in Jakarta and 
outside the capital in which detained JI suspects described 
how JI carried out its bombing plans.  In October, police put 
newly arrested terror suspects on national television where 
they admitted their involvement with JI, bomb plots, and 
asked forgiveness. 
 
19. The Indonesians have also participated in a number of 
international investigations, mostly with neighboring 
countries.  JI is a terror group that operates on a regional 
scale, and thus opportunities for cross-border investigations 
are numerous.  For example, the Philippines government on 
October 2 arrested a key Indonesian figure in JI, Taufiq 
Rifke, and within days gave Indonesian police access to him. 
Rifke, was scheduled as of late-November to be sent back to 
Indonesia to stand trial.  In addition, after the Bali 
bombings, the Indonesian police allowed the Australian 
Federal Police, the FBI and other police agencies to 
participate in that investigation.  The U.S. Government, 
since spring 2003, has helped train and equip a CT unit 
within the Indonesian police force. 
 
 
F) Major CT Efforts Taken in 2003 
--------------------------------- 
 
20. Indonesia has been hit by a series of terror bombings 
carried out by JI stretching back to the bombing of the 
Philippines Ambassador\'s residence in Jakarta on August 1, 
2000.  But it was only after the October 2002 Bali bombing 
that Jakarta admitted it had a problem and moved to confront 
JI.  In the wake of the Bali bombing, the Government 
permitted an unprecedented joint investigation with Australia 
(many of whose nationals died in the attack), assisted by the 
United States and other countries.  These efforts, led by the 
police, have netted more than 100 JI suspects, including 
senior leaders, operatives, trainers, financiers and 
accomplices.  Their subsequent testimony in open court helped 
identify the perpetrators of previously unsolved bombings 
dating back several years. 
 
21. At the 9th ASEAN summit in Bali October 7-9, Indonesia 
joined other member states in endorsing creation of an ASEAN 
Security Community (ASC).  The Community will strengthen 
national and regional capacity to counter terrorism and other 
transnational crimes.  The Government of Indonesia, as ASEAN 
Chairman, will draft a \"road map\" to implement the ASC.  This 
will be presented to other ASEAN member states at its next 
summit, to be held in Vientiane, Laos in 2004.  The 
Indonesian government had previously signed MOUs on CT 
cooperation with Thailand and the Philippines as well as 
leading the effort to adopt an ASEAN Police Chiefs agreement 
to cooperate and share information. 
 
 
G) Support for Terrorism 
------------------------ 
 
22. While the administration of President Megawati has 
generally performed well in the fight against terrorism, 
certain members of her senior cabinet from other political 
parties have, at times, undermined the government\'s resolve 
on this issue.  The Vice President Hamzah Haz called 
President Bush the \"King of Terrorists\" and met with JI 
leader Abu Bakar Ba\'ashir, prior to Ba\'asyir\'s arrest. 
 
 
H) Public Statements in Support of a Terror-Supporting 
Country on a Terrorism Issue 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
23. There has been no reported GOI support or public 
statements in support of countries that sponsor terrorism on 
a terrorism-related issue. 
 
 
I) Change in Attitude 
--------------------- 
 
24. Jakarta dramatically changed its approach toward 
terrorism at the end of 2002, and that new approach was 
reinforced during 2003.  Only after the October 2002 Bali 
bombings did Jakarta admit the existence of and threat posed 
by JI.  Subsequent bombings, including in Makassar, and 
several in Jakarta, including against the JW Marriott hotel 
in August 2003, demonstrated time and again to Indonesians 
their vulnerability to terrorism and its negative effects on 
the economy, the national image, and stability.  This open 
acknowledgement of terrorism as a national problem, the 
Government\'s aggressive steps to arrest terrorists linked to 
a small Muslim fringe group, and past history of the 
Government\'s suppression of Muslim organizations, prompted 
some concern and suspicion over government actions among 
Indonesia\'s mainstream Islamic community.  By and large, 
however, 2003 witnessed increasing public awareness of the 
dangers of terrorism and a strengthening public resolve to 
combat terrorist groups.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Coordinating Minister for Political and Security 
Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has stated openly his 
intention to run for the presidency in 2004.  He has not yet 
declared allegiance to any particular political party, 
however, and, consequently, is both widely courted and 
criticized as indecisive.  Yudhoyono\'s many options 
illustrate his broad appeal and potential to become the 
consensus candidate of a broad but not-yet-extant coalition. 
If he fails to make the right choice at the right time, 
however, he may wind up with little or no chance to win high 
office.  End Summary. 
 
THE WAITING GAME 
---------------- 
 
2. (C) Yudhoyono, who competed in 2001\'s People\'s 
Consultative Assembly (MPR) election for the vice presidency 
as the Muslim Sovereignty Union (PDU) nominee, long has 
appeared as a potential presidential candidate for 2004.  He 
directed the creation of the Democratic Party (PD) in 2002, 
although refusing to take a party position or to encourage 
publicly the perception that he would be PD\'s presidential 
nominee.  As the 2004 elections approached, other parties 
began to consider Yudhoyono a potential standard-bearer. 
Credible polls enhanced his appeal, as he rose in popularity 
throughout 2003, often placing second only to President 
Megawati.  In early January 2004, press articles quoted 
Yudhoyono saying he intended to run for the presidency and, 
accordingly, would resign from the cabinet when parties must 
nominate their candidates (early May 2004).  He declined to 
identify his political party of choice, however. 
 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PD): THE BIRD IN THE HAND 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (C) PD is a newcomer to the political scene and is widely 
seen as Yudhoyono\'s political machine; Yudhoyono\'s image 
graces the business card of party Chairman Budhisantoso as 
well as banners and stickers throughout the party 
headquarters.  Yudhoyono himself designed the party logo and 
drafted the by-laws.  In founding PD, Yudhoyono reportedly 
had the encouragement of 100 appointed members of the 
People\'s Consultative Assembly (MPR) and many local officials 
in conflict areas, such as Aceh and Papua.  Budhisantoso 
claimed PD has issued six million membership cards, although 
he admitted that he was uncertain of winning that many votes 
and twice mentioned to us he and the party suffered from a 
lack of funds.  PD has no distinctive ideological appeal and 
is reportedly hurt by weak organization.  Most of our 
contacts from other political parties readily dismiss PD\'s 
prospects of passing the threshold required to nominate a 
presidential candidate.  (Note: the threshold is three 
percent of the seats in the House of Representative or five 
percent of the popular vote.  End Note.) 
 
THE NATIONAL AWAKENING PARTY (PKB) 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Some of Yudhoyono\'s advisors tell us the Coordinating 
Minister recognizes PD\'s weaknesses and is holding out for 
the nomination of one of Indonesia\'s larger parties.  The 
party of choice, according to TB \"Benny\" Silalahi, a former 
Minister of State for Administrative Reform and now a member 
of Yudhoyono\'s campaign team, is the National Awakening Party 
(PKB).  In this scenario, former President (and PKB overlord) 
Abdurrachman Wahid, realizing that he cannot campaign 
credibly after his 2001 impeachment, decides to support 
Yudhoyono.  Several PKB contacts close to Wahid, including 
his daughter Yenny, have told us Yudhoyono is the figure most 
likely to gain Wahid\'s support if Wahid decides to withdraw 
-- a development no one guarantees.  According to Silalahi, 
20 of PKB\'s 30 provincial boards were supportive of a 
Yudhoyono nomination, with the remaining 10 likely soon to 
fall in line.  Silalahi claimed one main stumbling block for 
Yudhoyono was Wahid\'s high price for shifting roles from 
candidate to kingmaker.  Wahid reportedly wanted Yudhoyono to 
choose a PKB running mate and reserve half of his cabinet 
positions for PKB. 
 
PD: WE CAN SHARE, BUT WE DON\'T LIKE RADICALS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Noting that his main goal was to promote Yudhoyono\'s 
election, PD Chairman Budhisantoso told us he saw PKB more as 
a potential partner than as a rival for Yudhoyono\'s 
attention.  He said he had received positive signals from 
various factions within PKB and hoped to meet soon with 
former President Wahid.  He asserted that \"hundreds\" of 
Ulamas (senior Islamic figures) had expressed their support 
for Yudhoyono\'s candidacy.  Other Islamic parties aside from 
PKB also appear to view Yudhoyono positively; National 
Mandate Party (PAN) Chairman Amien Rais publicly named 
Yudhoyono as a possible running mate, and even officials of 
the staunchly Islamist Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) have 
suggested that they could support Yudhoyono.  But 
Budhisantoso was cool to an alliance of Islamic parties 
coalescing behind Yudhoyono; he warned that radical Islamists 
were the main enemies of Indonesia as a unitary state, and 
they would be difficult to control if Yudhoyono depended on 
their support. 
 
GOLKAR 
------ 
 
6. (C) Golkar party Chairman Akbar Tandjung in February 2003 
raised the possibility of Yudhoyono becoming Golkar\'s 
presidential nominee, when he provided the media with a short 
list that included the Coordinating Minister.  Yudhoyono did 
not register for Golkar\'s presidential convention process, 
however, and several Golkar Vice Chairmen have privately 
dismissed the idea of their party choosing Yudhoyono over 
other high-profile figures who have been courting Golkar\'s 
provincial, city, and regency boards for the past eight 
months.  Nevertheless, both Silalahi and Yudhoyono advisor 
Denny J.A. separately told us that, because of Yudhoyono\'s 
popularity, Akbar Tandjung had indicated a willingness to let 
Yudhoyono head Golkar\'s ticket, with Akbar as his running 
mate.  They added that Akbar might also continue to pursue 
his own presidential campaign and offer Yudhoyono the vice 
presidency. 
 
7. (C) Budhisantoso confided that potential Golkar 
presidential nominee Wiranto had dispatched a retired 
four-star General with a message that Yudhoyono should not 
run in the 2004 election.  Budhisantoso said this message was 
not intended as a threat.  He noted Yudhoyono felt no 
particular loyalty to Wiranto, citing Wiranto\'s once having 
blocked Yudhoyono from assuming a military command in 
Sumatra.  Budhisantoso also said Yudhoyono had no reason to 
fear Wiranto, as Wiranto, when accused of human rights 
violations in East Timor, had sought \"protection\" from 
Yudhoyono in his capacity as Coordinating Minister. 
 
PDI-P 
----- 
 
8. (S) Yudhoyono also has drawn the attention of leading 
Indonesian Democratic Party - Struggle (PDI-P) figures 
dissatisfied with Megawati\'s leadership.  Vice Chairmen 
Arifin Panigoro and Roy Janis -- both lead significant 
factions of PDI-P -- have told us of their interest in 
supporting Yudhoyono instead of Megawati (ref A).  According 
to Denny JA, Yudhoyono also has the support of some 
senior-generation nationalists within PDI-P, such as 
parliamentarian Abdul Madjid.  And Budhisantoso said 
grassroots-level PDI-P party cadres were seeking to defect to 
PD, specifically mentioning a group of 3,000 in Lampung 
province.  Budhisntoso said he was wary of taking in 
sympathizersfrom other parties because, at this stage, 
Yudhoono did not want to antagonize other political leaders. 
 
A RUNNING MATE 
----------------- 
 
9.(C) Many presidential hopefuls have considered tapping 
Yudhoyono as their vice-presidential running mate, drawn by 
his ethical image, intellectual prowess, military background, 
Javanese ethnicity -- and, perhaps most importantly, his 
reputation for loyalty.  Silalahi said Yudhoyono had told him 
that Megawati had offered him the vice presidency, but he was 
reluctant to accept .  First, he did not respect Megawati, 
due to her lack of education and vision, plus her husband\'s 
corruption.  Second, he feared a recurrence of the 1999 
\"Anyone But Mega\" dynamic, which might drag him down along 
with the President.  PD Chairman Budhisantoso also told us 
Yudhoyono had long assured his advisors that he would not 
settle for the Vice Presidency.  If his ambitions were 
limited to the number two position, Budhisantoso pointed out, 
why go through all the effort required to build his own party? 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) Many Indonesians consider Yudhoyono indecisive and 
interpret his failure to date to announce his presidential 
candidacy as a further indicator of his cautious temperament. 
 Nevertheless, we believe Yudhoyono has played his cards 
well.  The Democratic Party offers him a fallback option and 
a degree of bargaining leverage as he waits for a larger 
party\'s nomination.  PD should easily go along with any 
arrangement that would boost Yudhoyono\'s prospects, even if 
it means another party takes the lead.  Delaying the 
announcement of his candidacy makes it easier for Yudhoyono 
to remain in place as Coordinating Minister, a position that 
offers him constant and generally positive media exposure. 
He likely recalls that Islamic intellectual Nurcholish Madjid 
received a burst of coverage when first announcing his 
candidacy but has been largely dismissed after his clumsy 
entry into and then withdrawal from Golkar\'s process (ref B). 
 
11. (C) Yudhoyono\'s many options reflect his positive image 
in the eyes of top politicians.  His personal popularity 
implies that his impact in the presidential race, assuming he 
can secure nomination by a qualifying party or coalition, 
would exceed the vote tallies garnered by his political 
vehicle in the legislative election.  So long as matters in 
political parties appear unsettled or open to change, 
Yudhoyono will keep popping up on candidate short lists. 
However, as the pieces of the various puzzles fall into 
place, Yudhoyono will find avenues closing off, and he will 
have to show he can act decisively, or he might find rival 
candidates have locked up large constituencies.  But a few 
deft moves, combined with some lucky breaks, could allow 
Yudhoyono to pull together key social and political groups in 
support of a powerful presidential run.

SUBJECT: TIGHT RACE FOR GOLKAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION AS 
KALLA REPORTEDLY QUITS TO BECOME YUDHOYONO\'S RUNNING MATE 
 
Classified By: Political Officer David R. Greenberg, reason 1.4 (d). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Golkar party Chairman Akbar Tandjung and retired 
General Wiranto vie in a tight race for Golkar\'s presidential 
nomination.  Although Akbar enjoys some institutional 
advantages, we cannot predict the outcome of the April 20 
Golkar convention, as hundreds of party chapters will 
determine the winner in a semi-secret ballot in which, 
apparently, bribery will play a substantial role.  Whoever 
wins, the convention will have a major and possibly decisive 
impact on the presidential race.  Golkar sources and advisors 
to Democratic Party presidential nominee Susilo Bambang 
Yudhoyono have told us that Coordinating Minister for 
People\'s Welfare Jusuf Kalla has decided to withdraw from the 
convention and become Yudhoyono\'s running mate.  A 
Yudhoyono-Kalla ticket would have two capable leaders with 
clean reputations, but absent further partners it lacks a 
political machine with grassroots level presence.  End 
Summary. 
 
THE GOLKAR CONVENTION 
--------------------- 
 
2. (U) Golkar will hold its presidential convention on April 
20 in Jakarta.  Most Golkar officials describe it as 
determining the party\'s presidential nominee, although Golkar 
Chairman Akbar Tandjung has refused to guarantee that he will 
seek the presidency if he wins the convention.  The 
convention begins with brief presentations by participants, 
after which the party votes via a semi-secret balloting 
process.  (The Secretaries-General of provincial and 
city/regency level chapters witness the voting of the chapter 
chairpersons.)  Convention rules state that whoever wins a 
plurality wins the convention, but we understand Golkar 
leaders might institute a runoff if no one wins a majority in 
a first round vote. 
 
3. (U) Lower level party branches hold the majority of the 
convention voting power.  There are 545 votes in play 
(contrary to press reports which cite a variety of other 
figures): 
 
- The party Central Board has an 18-vote block (which Akbar 
Tandjung apparently has locked up); 
- 10 separate organizations associated with Golkar have one 
vote apiece; 
- 32 province-level party chapters have three-vote blocks; and 
- 421 city/regency level party chapters have one vote apiece. 
 
A TOUGH FIGHT 
------------- 
 
4. (C) Although six candidates currently participate in the 
convention process -- Akbar Tandjung, Wiranto, Surya Paloh, 
Aburizal Bakrie, Prabowo Subianto, and Jusuf Kalla -- all of 
our contacts agree that the race comes down to Akbar and 
Wiranto and remains too close to call.  Members of both camps 
told us recently that they had locked up roughly 200 
convention votes and expected to prevail.  Akbar enjoys some 
institutional advantages: he has a strong network among 
chapter heads; a long history of involvement in Golkar 
politics; and can reward supporters with positions at the 
party\'s upcoming (October) Congress (just as he could place 
supporters on the party\'s list of legislative candidates). 
Although the party appeared to fall short of its target in 
the April 5 legislative elections, Akbar\'s supporters can 
claim credit for the party\'s increase in the popular vote in 
absolute terms; its new plurality in the House of 
Representatives, including a gain of seats in absolute terms; 
and its number-one finish in more provinces than in 1999. 
 
THE MARKET VALUE OF CONVENTION VOTES 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Our contacts (and instincts) tell us bribery will play 
a significant role in shaping the convention outcome.  Nasir 
Tamara, a Wiranto campaign advisor, told us his own camp 
entices each city/regency chapter head with 25 million Rupiah 
(almost 3,000 USD) for its vote, while provincial chapter 
heads merited twice that sum.  A separate Wiranto associate 
alleged Akbar Tandjung offered \"a huge amount of money\" to 
chapter heads.  Meanwhile, Golkar Vice Chairman Aulia Rachman 
told us that Akbar provided chapter heads a few thousand 
dollars -- \"to show respect\" -- but that these sums paled in 
comparison to those doled out by media magnate Surya Paloh: 
almost 6,000 USD to the lower-level chapter heads and 1 
billion Rupiah (over 100,000 USD) for provincial chapter 
votes.  (Comment: The latter figure strains credibility, 
given Surya Paloh\'s poor prospects for winning, but we do not 
doubt that Aulia passed this rumor along in good faith.  End 
comment.)  Aulia claimed the strength of Akbar\'s network 
would prevail, since Akbar encouraged chapter heads to accept 
opponents\' offers but vote for him anyway.  According to a 
Singaporean diplomat, Wiranto\'s camp prepared for that 
possibility by offering half the payments up-front, with the 
rest only after Wiranto\'s convention victory. 
 
KALLA TO WITHDRAW, JOIN YUDHOYONO 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) On April 16, Golkar Vice Chairman Fahmi Idris told us 
he had spoken directly with Coordinating Minister for 
People\'s Welfare Jusuf Kalla, who confirmed he would withdraw 
from the convention and become retired General Yudhoyono\'s 
running mate.  Fahmi said Kalla -- who has never held a high 
leadership position in Golkar -- would not bring extensive 
party machinery to the ticket, but brought enough \"Golkar 
identity\" that he would help Yudhoyono to become an 
alternative choice in this election for traditional Golkar 
voters.  Fahmi, who has publicly aired his distaste for 
Akbar, told us he would support the Yudhoyono-Kalla ticket. 
 
7. (C) Two senior figures close to Yudhoyono also have told 
us that this ticket seemed certain.  In addition, politically 
active retired General Luhut Panjaitan told us April 16 he 
had confirmed that Kalla would join Yudhoyono, withdraw from 
the Golkar convention, and resign from the cabinet.  Luhut 
hoped that Akbar, if triumphant at the convention, would 
decide to throw Golkar\'s support behind the Yudhoyono-Kalla 
ticket. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) Yudhoyono advisors noted Kalla appeals to them partly 
because of his prestige in East Indonesia, where Yudhoyono\'s 
Democratic Party has little strength.  He also strikes us as 
a relatively ethical, intelligent, and competent person who 
can work well with Yudhoyono.  This combination -- the 
subject of great speculation in the media recently -- appears 
to enjoy strong support in the Indonesian business community, 
partly because of Kalla\'s record as a successful businessman. 
 Neither, however, controls a strong political machine with 
grassroots penetration; this could prove problematic. 
 
9. (C) Kalla\'s withdrawal should boost Akbar\'s chances at the 
convention; our contacts estimate more of his supporters lean 
toward Akbar vice Wiranto.  If Akbar does win, we would not 
rule out his aligning with Yudhoyono, if offered substantial 
incentives (e.g., cabinet positions).  This alignment, for 
the first round election, would appear more palatable to 
Golkar leaders if Yudhoyono has assembled a coalition that 
rivals Golkar in size.  With full Golkar backing, Yudhoyono 
would prove an extremely strong contender. 
 
10. (C) On the other hand, however, Akbar could decide to run 
for president.  While he might have difficulty consolidating 
support in Golkar, he could run a credible campaign, 
particularly with a Javanese running mate with a reasonably 
clean reputation and a degree of grassroots support.  Akbar 
could seek the presidency with the understanding that he 
retains the fallback position of supporting Yudhoyono\'s 
ticket in the runoff if Yudhoyono outperforms him in the 
first round. 
 
11. (C) Should Wiranto prevail at the convention, we would 
expect him to move quickly to solidify his control over the 
Golkar apparatus.  He has cultivated extensive ties with 
other parties and might pull the Prosperous Justice Party 
(PKS) and Abdurrachman Wahid\'s National Awakening Party into 
a coalition (septels report on affinity for Wiranto in PKS). 
Together, those three parties appear to have won around 40 
percent of the vote on April 5.  This action could lead other 
Islamic parties to jump on the bandwagon, generating strong 
momentum for a powerful combination of cooperative Islamic 
parties and Golkar\'s extensive machinery under the leadership 
of a charismatic Javanese retired General.

Classified By: EST&H OFFICER ANTHONY C. WOODS FOR REASON 1.5 (b, d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Chairman of the Nuclear Energy Control Board 
(BAPETEN) Dr. Djaloeis (please protect) confided to us 25 
July that political intrigue involving one of his deputies 
and the State Minister of Research and Technology Hatta 
Rajasa, and a previously unknown radical Islamic group called 
Tharbyah posed a threat to his position. Djaloies said, 
however, that a vigorous defense of his past accomplishments 
and future plans for the agency in a letter sent to President 
Megawati convinced her to extend his tenure beyond the 
customary retirement age of 60. This could well be a 
sensationalized tale of ordinary bureaucratic infighting. 
Djaloeis said the upcoming presidential elections meant his 
future beyond that remained uncertain. Given Djaloies has 
played a pivotal role in enhanced bilateral cooperative 
efforts between Indonesia and the USG on a range of 
nuclear-related issues of importance to the U.S. We would 
hope any successor would not setback our nascent cooperation. 
End Summary. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. (U) Dr. Djaloeis, who became Chairman of the Nuclear 
Energy Control Board (BAPETEN) April 4 last year, reports 
directly to the President. He has three key assistants: i) 
Deputy for Nuclear Safety Assessment, Azanatio Lasman; ii) 
Deputy for Administration, and Executive Secretary, Sukarman 
Amin Joyo; and iii) Deputy for License and Inspections, 
Suharto Zahir. Usually, the Chairman and his deputies are 
nominated together to ensure a harmonious and effective team. 
However, although Djaloies nominally reports to the 
President, on certain procedural issues he actually reports 
through the State Minister for Research and Technology, Hatta 
Rajasa, whose ministry coordinates all technical agencies, 
including BAPETEN, that deal with science, technology and 
research. 
 
Retirement 
---------- 
 
3. (C) Djaloeis told EST&H officer 25 May that recent 
political intrigue, perhaps encouraged by his putative 
imminent retirement, could imperil his tenure at the agency. 
He said that as far as he knew, he had no issues with his 
colleagues and indeed considered them friends and even part 
of his family. He noted, however, that as his 60th birthday 
approached (May 9, 2004), the customary civil service 
retirement age, two of his deputies, Zahir and Joyo expressed 
anxiety about his potential successor. He confided that he 
was puzzled by Lasman\'s silence on the issue but thought 
nothing of it then. Djaloeis revealed to Zahir and Joyo his 
intention to request a year\'s extension (a common procedure 
in the Indonesian civil service) and they agreed that he and 
all three deputies should solicit Minister Rajasa\'s views. 
 
The Appeal 
---------- 
 
4. (C) Djaloeis said that after he had defended his record 
and presented future plans for BAPETEN to Rajasa in the 
presence of his deputies on 4 January, the Minister assured 
him that he would recommend approval of his request to extend 
to the President. However, with no response by mid February, 
Djaloeis said he and two of his deputies revisited Rajasa. 
Rajasa surprised the group by declaring that he did not have 
a say in Djaloeis\' extension. Instead, he pointed to Faisal 
Thamin, the State Minister for the Utilization of State 
Institutions, as having jurisdiction over civil service 
appointees. Pressed for further clarification, Rajasa 
abruptly stated that the President would make the final 
decision. Djaloeis said Rajasa rejected his request to 
present his case directly by letter to Megawati, insisting 
that it had to be sent through Rajasa\'s office. However, 
after sending the letter through Rajasa on February 26, he 
could never confirm receipt of the letter by Rajasa. 
 
The Deal 
-------- 
 
5. (C) Djaloeis said his scheduled departure for the Nuclear 
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) meetings in New York forced him to 
be proactive to avoid unpleasant surprises during his 
absence. Thus he met separately with each of his deputies to 
remind them of his friendship, emphasize his record at 
BAPETEN, and solicit their continued support. Of the three, 
only Lasman demurred, and when pressed, he confessed that 
Rajasa planned to replace Djaloies and make him Chairman. 
Lasman explained to a shocked Djaloeis that the plan emerged 
from a deal between the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), 
headed by Hidayat Nur Wahid, and the National Mandate Party 
(PAN), led by Amien Rais. Asked how he got Lasman to reveal 
such damaging information, Djaloeis opined that Lasman 
appeared consumed by unease and guilt regarding his apparent 
betrayal and thus could bear his secret no more. 
 
What Lies Beneath 
----------------- 
 
6. (S) Djaloeis made further allegations to us regarding the 
whole affair. He said a good friend of his (he did not 
divulge the name) had  previously been a cell member of the 
\"radical Islamic group Tharbyah,\" and disclosed that the 
organization was behind the plot. The former insider alleged 
that PAN is actually a front for the extremist organization. 
The informant told Djaloies that Tharbyah (Islamic Spiritual 
Education) had recently expelled him because he did not show 
the absolute loyalty demanded of its members. Finally, the 
source alleged that Lasman is a high-ranking member of 
Tharbyah. Djaloies concluded that since Hatta is PAN\'s 
Secretary General, it explained his involvement in the 
scheme. He said the plotters had viewed his putative 
retirement on May 9 2004, his 60th birthday, as the perfect 
opportunity to secure the top job for one of their own. 
 
Rearguard Action and Success 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Djaloeis said that on the day of Lasman\'s revelation, 
he sent the same letter he had drafted for Rajasa directly to 
Megawati. Two days later, on 22 April, he said another of his 
deputies (Joyo) confirmed Djaloeis\' proposed ouster from 
Rajasa\'s personal secretary, Dr. Ashwin Sasongko. Joyo also 
revealed that on 23 April, he and Zahir unsuccessfully tried 
to persuade Lasman to delay his ambitions for two to three 
years. On April 24, the day of his departure for the NPT 
conference in New York, Djaloies met with all three deputies 
and warned them of the unspecified negative consequences for 
Lasman and BAPETEN should he be forced to retire. (Note: 
Djaloeis told us that enhanced cooperration with USDOE could 
suffer from his abrupt departure. End Note). Djaloies finally 
recounted with relish Rajasa\'s public acknowledgement before 
parliament that the President had approved Djaloeis\' his 
retirement extension. This happened May 13 in response to PAN 
parliamentarian Nur Adnan\'s request that Rajasa explain 
Djaloeis\' continued tenure at BAPETEN after reaching retirement 
age. 
 
Postscript 
---------- 
 
8. (C) During the meeting, Djaloies seemed dazed, bemused and 
at times defiant at his recent predicament. He characterized 
his struggle as important to prevent extremist elements from 
determining the fate of his agency. Toward the end of our 
meeting, he introduced a BAPETEN colleague named Hieronimus 
Salam, whom Djaloeis claimed was secretly assisting him in 
his fight to keep his job. Later that day, Salam sent us a 
text message declaring that he is a practicing Catholic, who 
is determined to \"attack and reduce the power of Jamaah 
Islamiya\" in Indonesia. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Djaloies appeared convinced of the veracity of his 
source\'s assertions,  especially since they solved (for him 
at least) a number of puzzling questions he had concerning 
Lasman and Rajasa\'s role in the botched affair. Djaloies 
source, in labeling PAN as a front for Tharbyah, could be 
drawing conclusions from rumor, hearsay, or perhaps 
non-representative experiences. We never heard of this group 
before but open source searches came up with a few groups 
with similar sounding names. For instance, the Tarbiyah 
(Islamic Education), alias Ikwanul Muslimin (IM), supposedly 
emerged in Indonesia in the 1980\'s with the return of 
scholars from the Middle East. Besides religion, its 
teachings encompass socioeconomic and political issues, with 
the ultimate goal of an Islamic State. Another source (FBIS 
quoted Sloahuddin, an Indonesian freelance journalist) stated 
that a certain Tarbiyah or IM became the PKS. Other open 
sources claim the \"Tarbiyah Movement\" in Indonesia, with 
generous funding from Saudi Arabia, has 
established congregations or \"jamaah salaf\" among students at 
various state universities, such as the Bandung Institute of 
Technology (ITB). Yet another open source claimed that IM (or 
Tarbiyah) is \"the biggest Islamic movement in the modern 
era,\" whose primary goal is to arrest the trend of 
secularization in the Islamic world. 
 
10. (C) Of course Djaloeis may just be sensationalizing 
ordinary bureaucratic infighting by appealing to what he 
considers our concerns. While there are ardent Islamists 
associated with PAN, and PAN enjoys close ties with PKS, it 
seems highly unlikely that PAN -- one of Indonesia\'s main 
political parties - is a front for Tharbyah. Furthermore, in 
his capacity as PAN Secretary General, Hatta Rajasa has 
fought against the Islamists in the party to advocate a more 
pluralistic approach. We suspect that Djaloies sees an 
Islamist motivation where none exists. Whether he seeks to 
create one, hoping it will resonate with us, is unclear. 
There could be many non-ideological reasons -- job 
preservation -- why Djaloeis has shared with us his account 
of Rajasa\'s efforts to replace him. 
 
11. (C) Djaloeis has played  a pivotal role in the 
accelerated pace of close cooperation with USDOE over the 
past year. His numerous visits to Washington to move policy 
along (refs A, B, E and F) and his pivotal role in DOE and 
IAEA visits to provide security safeguards to Indonesia\'s 
three nuclear facilities (ref G), remove and return spent 
fuel to the U.S. this past March (ref D), and provide 
security upgrades to radiological facilities nationwide (ref 
C) clearly demonstrate his positive role in continued 
US-Indonesian cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. His retirement extension to the end of December may 
be only a temporary reprieve. The next president will most 
likely have the final say on whether Djaloies stays. With 
just over a month before the first round of presidential 
elections, the PAN candidate appears unlikely to make it into 
the second round.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Indonesian Electoral Commission (KPU) on July 26 
certified final results from the first round Presidential 
election, placing Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and President 
Megawati Soekarnoputri into the September runoff election. 
An advisor to retired General Wiranto told us that Wiranto 
plans a Constitutional Court challenge, based on evidence 
that he received more votes than Megawati.  This advisor 
stressed that Wiranto insists on a peaceful process to 
challenge the election result, implying that some around him 
proposed protests in the streets.  Amien Rais\'s team also 
intends to challenge the election result, although with less 
conviction that their candidate deserves to have qualified 
for the runoff.  Amien\'s team will also claim Police 
officials acted in a partisan manner.  We doubt that errors 
in the vote count were material, and we do not sense 
widespread public rejection of these results.  End Summary. 
 
FINAL VOTE COUNT 
---------------- 
 
2. (U) The KPU on July 26 certified the final results of the 
July 5 first round presidential election as follows: 
 
                                         QUICK COUNT 
CANDIDATE        VOTES        PERCENT    PROJECTION 
---------        -----        -------    ----------- 
Yudhoyono        39,838,184   33.57      33.15 
Megawati         31,569,104   26.60      26.02 
Wiranto          26,286,788   22.15      23.34 
Amien            17,392,931   14.66      14.42 
Haz               3,569,861    3.01       3.29 
Total           118,656,868 
 
(Note: With 156,102,364 registered voters and 2,636,976 
invalid votes cast, this data indicates voter turnout of 77.7 
percent, down from the 84.1 percent turnout for the 
legislative election.  End Note.) 
 
TIMETABLE TO CHALLENGE THE RESULTS 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The election law provides that candidates have three 
days from the announcement of the final results to submit 
objections to the Constitutional Court.  The Court must then 
rule on those objections within 14 days.  Thus, July 29 marks 
the filing deadline, and August 12 represents the deadline 
for the Court\'s decision on objections submitted on the last 
day. 
 
WIRANTO\'S CAMP PLANS CHALLENGE 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) An expatriate advisor to Wiranto told us on July 27 
that Wiranto\'s team definitely would file an objection with 
the Constitutional Court.  He asserted optimistically that 
the team had \"an enormous amount of evidence\" that Wiranto 
had lost a decisive number of legitimate votes.  When asked 
about the July 23 rumor that Wiranto led the manual vote 
count by 0.7 percent (ref A), the advisor confirmed that the 
rumored lead tracked with the Wiranto team\'s data; he implied 
there was more to the story of the rumor that he could not 
disclose. 
 
5. (C) The advisor claimed that the clear majority of 
\"errors\" in the vote count that disadvantaged Wiranto was 
deliberate.  He said Wiranto\'s team had consulted with a 
failed bidder on the KPU\'s computer system tender and had 
determined a number of vulnerabilities in the system.  He 
believed the electronic vote counting system was 
manipulated, and the manual counts were  then adjusted to 
track with the desired result.  He clearly implied -- but did 
not explicitly state -- that Megawati\'s team committed the 
fraud. 
 
6. (C) Wiranto\'s team will soon begin a public relations 
campaign to accompany its court challenge, according to the 
same advisor.  Some loyal Wiranto supporters felt cheated and 
extremely angry.  In a July 27 meeting, Wiranto had twice 
stressed that any challenges to the election result had to 
occur peacefully.  The advisor strongly implied that others 
around Wiranto counseled street protests, demonstrations, and 
similar activities.  The advisor worried that these actions 
would receive international coverage and project an image of 
instability in Indonesia. 
 
7. (C) Golkar leaders, however, continue to desert Wiranto. 
On July 26, Ferry Baldan, the Vice Chairman of the House of 
Representatives Committee on Legal Affairs (also the Vice 
Chairman of the Special Committee that drafted the election 
laws), spoke out publicly against Wiranto\'s earlier call for 
a manual recount, and expressed his support for the KPU\'s 
controversial ruling on double-punched ballots.  He did not 
address possible Constitutional Court challenges, however. 
 
AMIEN\'S CAMP ALSO TO CHALLENGE RESULTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) National Mandate Party (PAN) Deputy Secretary General 
Alvin Lie told us on July 27 that Amien Rais\'s team also 
planned to file a challenge with the Constitutional Court. 
Alvin was not confident, however, that Amien could show that 
rectifying errors in the count would change the runoff 
participants.  However, Alvin said many witnesses, with data 
from voting stations throughout the country, could 
demonstrate significant errors in the vote count.  Speaking 
from memory, Alvin claimed that, when approximately 85 
million votes had been tabulated, Amien, Megawati, and 
Wiranto each had won around 20 percent of the vote.  Alvin 
bitterly criticized the KPU as dishonest, inaccurate, and 
arrogant. 
 
9. (C) Alvin also said that Amien\'s team would file a 
complaint in an administrative court based on illegal Police 
involvement in campaign activities.  (Note: Since July 25, 
the local press has reported on an anonymously sourced video 
showing the Regional Police Commander of Banyumas regency, 
Central Java, meeting prior to July 5 with active and retired 
police officers.  The Commander urged support for Megawati in 
the presidential race.  End Note.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) Constitutional Court proceedings related to 
Indonesia\'s legislative election demonstrated that errors in 
the vote count can occur, and can be rectified.  However, the 
National Democratic Institute (NDI) quick count gives us a 
degree of confidence that errors in the July 5 vote count 
were not material.  It would require a Herculean effort to 
document, based on witness observations, that over 2.5 
million votes in Megawati\'s column actually were cast for 
Wiranto.  The media and general public have not expressed the 
sort of discontent that we hear from the losing candidates\' 
camps.  We doubt that Wiranto\'s upcoming challenge will 
resonate strongly with the Indonesian electorate.

Classified By: Political Officer David R. Greenberg, reason: 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\'s projected win in the 
September 20 presidential runoff marks a resounding victory 
for Indonesian democracy.  The challenger defeated a 
President who had forged an alliance with Indonesia\'s oldest 
and largest political parties, while credible reports 
indicated the government bureaucracy would pull out all the 
stops for the incumbent.  We attribute Yudhoyono\'s victory to 
three main factors: Indonesian dissatisfaction with the 
status quo; Yudhoyono\'s personal popularity; and the free and 
fair nature of the electoral process -- something few here 
take for granted. 
 
2. (S) Yudhoyono will have little time to revel in his 
victory, however.  He has only a few weeks to form a cabinet. 
 A near-term revamping of the leadership of Yudhoyono\'s 
Democratic Party (PD) appears likely.  Yudhoyono also likely 
will devote some attention to upcoming congresses in other 
political parties, which could set the tone for his relations 
with the legislative branch for the next five years.  The 
Ambassador had a productive discussion of governance issues 
with Yudhoyono in June, and we are confident he shares many 
of our priorities.  End Summary. 
 
A TRIUMPH FOR DEMOCRACY 
----------------------- 
 
3. (U) In February and early March of this year, under 10 
percent of the public identified Yudhoyono as the best 
candidate for President, according to credible International 
Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) polling.  He placed 
slightly behind President Megawati and People\'s Consultative 
Assembly (MPR) Chairman Amien Rais.  However, Yudhoyono 
quickly acquired momentum in the polls after he resigned his 
position as Coordinating Minister for Political and Security 
Affairs, following a public spat with First Gentleman Taufik 
Kiemas.  IFES found Yudhoyono easily surpassing Megawati in 
late March, then breaking far from the pack of other 
candidates with over 30 percent support in mid-April. 
 
4. (U) After the first-round presidential election, Megawati 
assembled a coalition that included Indonesia\'s oldest and 
largest parties, teaming her Indonesian Democratic Party - 
Struggle (PDI-P) with Golkar, the United Development Party 
(PPP) and other small parties, which together represented a 
majority of the popular vote in the April legislative 
election.  Two large parties -- the National Awakening Party 
(PKB) and National Mandate Party (PAN) -- adopted formally 
neutral positions.  Yudhoyono wound up formally supported by 
only four parties represented in the 2004-2009 parliament: 
his own Democratic Party, formed from scratch only two years 
ago; the Crescent Moon and Star Party (PBB); the Prosperous 
Justice Party (PKS); and the Indonesian Justice and Unity 
Party (PKPI).  Together, these four parties -- none of which 
existed in any form before 1999 -- will hold just over 20 
percent of the seats in parliament.  Yudhoyono\'s coalition 
looked like an awkward alliance, given the diverse 
ideological positions of the parties and prior friction 
between the two staunchly Islamist members, PKS and PBB. 
 
5. (C) With a hierarchical culture and a modern history of 
authoritarian rule, even many sophisticated Indonesians 
believed political party machinery would prove important, if 
not decisive, in the presidential runoff.  While internal 
divisions surfaced in the parties backing Megawati, it 
appeared that the wealth and power of the First Family could 
compensate.  Megawati\'s control over the government apparatus 
-- particularly the Ministry of Home Affairs, state-owned 
enterprises, the Police, and the State Intelligence Agency 
(BIN) -- worried Yudhoyono\'s camp, especially as National 
Police Chief Da\'i Bachtiar and BIN Chief Hendropriyono 
appeared increasingly partisan. 
 
6. (C) Yudhoyono\'s victory thus appears as a remarkable 
triumph of a popular, articulate figure against a rival with 
more power, money, and connections.  His exposure as a member 
of Megawati\'s and Abdurrahman Wahid\'s cabinets provided a 
base for his popularity.  And yet the ruckus surrounding his 
resignation, and his emphasis on appealing directly to the 
voters instead of simply courting politicians, gave him the 
aura of an outsider and underdog.  With credible polling 
showing a clear majority of Indonesians felt dissatisfied 
with the status quo, Yudhoyono became the most viable 
alternative to Megawati. 
 
7. (C) Yudhoyono could not have won, however, without the 
systemic reforms that took place from 1999 until 2003, as the 
MPR amended the Constitution to provide for the citizenry\'s 
direct election of the President (instead of election by the 
MPR), and the House of Representatives passed 
government-drafted election laws that strengthened the 
independence of the General Election Commission (KPU). 
Ironically, while our contacts told us Megawati\'s camp would 
stop at nothing to ensure the incumbent\'s reelection, the 
mechanisms that Megawati herself helped to establish may have 
deterred or frustrated the more ruthless efforts.  (Note: 
Megawati, whose party won a plurality in 1999, had to settle 
for the Vice Presidency after her rivals outmaneuvered her in 
the MPR.  When the MPR redesigned the election system, 
Megawati surely felt this would work to her advantage, 
although we do not begrudge her credit for reform-mindedness 
as well.  End Note.) 
 
A CABINET MOSTLY COMPOSED OF PROFESSIONALS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. (C) Yudhoyono faces immediate pressure to select a 
cabinet.  He indicated publicly on September 20 that he would 
wait until after a formal KPU determination of his election 
victory before announcing a cabinet (the KPU should announce 
final results by October 5), but he would announce his 
line-up before his October 20 inauguration.  Running mate 
Jusuf Kalla told reporters September 21 that Yudhoyono would 
announce his cabinet on inauguration day.  We believe 
Yudhoyono already has a cabinet in mind, although he likely 
has guarded his plans closely so as not to alienate 
supporters hoping for cabinet positions.  He has stated 
publicly that most cabinet members will be professionals.  A 
credible source told us in early September that Yudhoyono 
particularly insists that non-partisan figures occupy the 
following key positions: Attorney General, National Police 
Chief, Chief of the State Intelligence Agency (BIN), Minister 
for State-Owned Enterprises, Minister for Energy and Mineral 
Resources, and Governor of Bank 
Indonesia (not a cabinet position).  Besides selecting 
cabinet members, Yudhoyono and his team also will continue to 
plan a restructuring of the cabinet and the creation of an 
Office of the President based on the United States model. 
 
SOME LIKELY CABINET MEMBERS 
--------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Prominent lawyer and human rights activist Todung 
Mulya Lubis likely appears on a short list of Yudhoyono\'s 
candidates for Attorney General.  A top Yudhoyono advisor had 
mentioned to us over the summer that Police Major General 
Sutanto -- a former East Java Police Chief -- had come to the 
team\'s attention as a possible candidate for National Police 
Chief.  Army Deputy Chief of Staff Djoko Santoso appears 
likely ultimately to become the next Armed Forces (TNI) 
Commander, but he would need to become the Army Chief first. 
Consequently, Yudhoyono could opt to extend the present TNI 
Commander, General Sutarto. Meanwhile, the prospects for the 
current Army Chief of Staff, Ryacudu Ryamizard, have 
diminished given his reputation for making irresponsible 
ultra-nationalist comments, and his well-known support for 
Megawati. 
 
10. (C) We have heard Yudhoyono recognizes he should appoint 
few former Generals to his cabinet, despite the 
disproportionate number of retired military officers in his 
campaign team.  Numerous contacts believe the two most likely 
retired Generals to hold cabinet positions in Yudhoyono\'s 
administration are Sudi Silalahi, as Coordinating Minister 
for Political and Security Affairs (having formerly worked as 
Yudhoyono\'s Secretary when Yudhoyono held that position), and 
national campaign team Chairman Mohamad Ma\'ruf, as Minister 
of Home Affairs.  A well-placed contact recently told us 
Yudhoyono will certainly appoint a civilian as Minister of 
Defense, and Yudhoyono had considered current Ambassador to 
the United Kingdom Juwono Sudarsono for that position, 
although Juwono\'s poor health (NFI) reduced the possibility 
of this appointment. 
 
11. (C) Yudhoyono had mentioned to the Ambassador in June 
(ref D) that he considered both current Finance Minister 
Boediono and noted economist Sri Mulyani as contenders for 
his cabinet.  We believe he had Boediono in mind when he told 
the press on September 20 that he might ask \"two or three\" 
members of the current cabinet to take positions in his 
administration. 
 
WHERE WILL THE ISLAMISTS GO? 
---------------------------- 
 
12. (C) PBB Chairman Yusril Mahendra, the current Justice 
Minister, appears highly likely to receive a position in 
Yudhoyono\'s administration.  Credible rumors indicate he may 
become State Secretary (SecNeg); Yudhoyono indicated to the 
Ambassador in June (ref D) that Yusril would not have 
influence over counter-terrorism matters, a prediction 
consistent with the SecNeg rumor.  Meanwhile, Yudhoyono has 
promised four cabinet seats to PKS -- two for party 
officials, and two for professionals sympathetic to the 
party.  A member of the PKS team that negotiated with 
Yudhoyono told us in early September that PKS had made four 
proposals.  Our source said Yudhoyono took on board these 
names but made no commitments regarding particular 
individuals or positions.  PKS had suggested: 
 
- PKS Chairman Hidayat Nur Wahid as Minister of Social 
Affairs; 
- PKS Board of Experts Chairman Suripto as Minister of 
Defense or Minister of Home Affairs; 
- University of Indonesia Professor Agus Nurhadi as Minister 
of Education; and 
- Lasman (phonetic) as Minister of Research and Technology. 
Our PKS source identified Lasman as a current official of 
that Ministry, but he may be Nuclear Energy Control Board 
(BAPETEN) official As Natio Lasman (ref E). 
 
KALLA\'S ROLE? 
------------- 
 
13. (C) Credible reports indicate that Yudhoyono offered 
Jusuf Kalla various incentives in order to lure him onto 
Yudhoyono\'s ticket.  Kalla provided significant financial 
resources for the campaign, as well as inroads into Golkar\'s 
network.  It remains unclear how Yudhoyono will define 
Kalla\'s influence as Vice President, and whether Kalla will 
have the leeway to bring allies of his into the cabinet.  We 
expect that, to whatever extent possible, Kalla and his 
loyalists aim to focus on economic and financial matters. 
 
WHAT ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? 
-------------------------------- 
 
14. (C) It remains unclear whether Yudhoyono will appoint PD 
Chairman Subur Budhisantoso to the cabinet.  PD contacts have 
harshly criticized Budhisantoso, a University of Indonesia 
anthropology professor, as ineffective.  His unremarkable 
performance during the election, which reportedly frustrated 
Yudhoyono at times, makes him an unlikely cabinet member. 
However, Yudhoyono may want to ensure Budhisantoso receives a 
respected position, in order to allow him a face-saving exit 
from PD\'s top position and enable a long-awaited 
restructuring of the party\'s leadership.  In a recent sign of 
PD\'s lack of discipline, the Central Board recently suspended 
the entire PD membership of the Jakarta regional parliament. 
This move came after the PKS candidate for the parliament\'s 
speakership -- Achmad Heryawan, a member of the PKS Syuro 
Council (supreme body) -- failed to receive sufficient PD 
votes to win the top job, which instead went to a Golkar 
candidate.  (Ref A provides more information on associates of 
Yudhoyono, in and outside of PD, who likely hope for offers 
of cabinet jobs.) 
 
OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES FACING SHAKE-UPS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
15. (C) Both Golkar and PDI-P will hold party congresses in 
coming months.  The outcome of leadership struggles in those 
two parties -- Indonesia\'s largest -- could determine the 
environment Yudhoyono faces in parliament for the rest of his 
term, as well as some of his likely rivals for the 2009 
election.  Golkar Chairman Akbar Tandjung has promised the 
National Coalition that backed Megawati\'s candidacy will 
remain united and form an opposition block, declining any 
cabinet positions that Yudhoyono might offer.  However, few 
Indonesian politicians relish the prospect of an adversarial 
relationship with the presidency, and Akbar\'s survival as 
Golkar Chairman appears in doubt.  (It appears that, in 
recent days, Akbar focused more on eliminating his enemies 
within the party than on rounding up voters for Megawati.) 
 
16. (C) Either Jusuf Kalla -- who competed for Golkar\'s 
presidential nomination in the party\'s convention process -- 
or purged former cabinet members Marzuki Darusman and Fahmi 
Idris could play a role in overthrowing Akbar and aligning 
Golkar with Yudhoyono.  Marzuki and Fahmi would benefit in 
that effort from the signal of support that Yudhoyono could 
send with a cabinet appointment.  (Marzuki also told us he 
has communicated with Yudhoyono\'s team about possibly 
assuming a role in PD.) 
 
17. (C) Similarly, PDI-P\'s future remains uncertain. 
Megawati\'s desire and ability to remain as Chairwoman are 
unclear.  First Gentleman Taufik Kiemas has a clear incentive 
to retain control of the party -- the more power he retains, 
the better the chances that he will escape unpunished for his 
legendary corruption during his wife\'s tenure.  However, many 
in PDI-P dislike Taufik and blame him for the party\'s poor 
performance in recent elections.  Vice Chairmen Arifin 
Panigoro and Roy Janis have told us they have an interest in 
competing for the party\'s chairmanship, and both claim to 
have cultivated ties to Yudhoyono.  Either a cabinet 
appointment or some other symbolic gesture from Yudhoyono 
could signal to PDI-P officials that those in the party who 
want to enjoy good relations with the President should back a 
particular alternative to the current First Family. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
18. (C) While the September 20 election marks an amazing 
triumph of Indonesian democracy, Yudhoyono will have little 
time to celebrate.  His apparent victory has opened political 
floodgates, with under a month to go before inauguration.  He 
will have to form a cabinet that taps a relatively small pool 
of people who appear competent, clean, and capable at least 
of objectivity, if not loyalty directly to him.  He will need 
to balance representation of ethnic, religious, and 
professional affiliations, in a way that dispels fears of 
\"militarism\" and makes him appear neither overly secular nor 
ardently Islamist.  He will need to settle some debts he has 
incurred and break bad news to many supporters who had hoped 
for significant rewards.  And, even while he tries to 
strengthen his own Democratic Party, he would be wise to 
devote some attention to the turmoil afflicting Golkar and 
PDI-P, since developments over the next few months will 
determine whom he has to negotiate with for the duration of 
his five-year term. 
 
19. (S) The Ambassador and Yudhoyono had a productive 
exchange on governance and cabinet formation, among other 
matters, on June 1 (ref D).  While Yudhoyono understands the 
importance of a strong bilateral relationship, public 
accusations that he is too close to the USG have sensitized 
him to contact with us (ref B).  We are confident, however, 
that he recognizes and, to a meaningful degree, shares our 
priorities and concerns.  After his victory becomes official, 
we will seek out a meeting with Yudhoyono for a discussion of 
the challenges that lie ahead.

Classified By: Political Officer David R. Greenberg, reason: 1.4 (d). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) The House of Representatives (DPR) on October 15 voted 
to slow-track President Megawati\'s appointment of Ryamizard 
Ryacudu as Armed Forces (TNI) Commander.  This decision marks 
a victory for President-elect Yudhoyono, who recently told 
the Ambassador he did not appreciate Megawati\'s nominating 
Ryamizard in her final days in office (ref B).  However, the 
coalition of parties supporting Yudhoyono in parliament 
remains fragile and could disintegrate if party leaders 
disagree with Yudhoyono\'s cabinet choices.  Yudhoyono likely 
will revoke the presidential letter to the DPR that sought to 
elevate Ryamizard, instead retaining Endriartono Sutarto as 
TNI Commander.  End Summary. 
 
MAJORITY RESISTS PRO-MEGAWATI COALITION 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Members of the DPR decided in an October 15 plenary 
session to defer action on President Megawati\'s letter 
requesting DPR approval of Army Chief of Staff Ryamizard 
Ryacudu\'s appointment as Commander of the Armed Forces (TNI) 
(ref A).  The debate over how to react to Megawati\'s letter 
reflected a division along partisan lines.  \"National 
Coalition\" parties that had backed President Megawati\'s 
reelection effort (minus the United Development Party -- PPP 
-- which recently broke off) argued that the DPR should 
establish a Special Committee (PANSUS) to hold hearings over 
the weekend and pave the way for a change of command prior to 
President-elect Yudhoyono\'s inauguration.  The parties 
outside of the National Coalition -- a loose grouping often 
dubbed the \"People\'s Coalition,\" currently aligned with 
Yudhoyono -- argued that hearings could wait until the DPR 
had established its commissions for the 2004-2009 period. 
 
3. (U) After a break for closed-door consultations, 
Megawati\'s Indonesian Democratic Party - Struggle (PDI-P) and 
its allies gave in to the majority position.  (Note: The 
National Coalition now consists of Golkar, PDI-P, the 
Prosperous Peace Party (PDS), and the Reform Star Party (PBR) 
-- representing a combined total of 264 of the DPR\'s 550 
seats.  End Note.)  Presumably, once inaugurated, Yudhoyono 
will send a new letter to the DPR, keeping TNI Commander 
Endriartono Sutarto in place and rendering this issue moot. 
 
4. (C) In the legislative battle over Sutarto\'s resignation 
and Ryamizard\'s appointment, Yudhoyono and his allies 
overcame opposition from a coalition that includes the two 
largest political parties.  However, the same pro-Yudhoyono 
constellation failed during the vote for DPR leadership 
positions (ref C), at least partly because of a split in the 
National Awakening Party.  On that occasion, parties\' core 
interests were at stake, and the National Coalition devoted 
substantial resources to install its leadership slate.  By 
contrast, sparse attendance on October 15 -- barely more than 
half the DPR\'s legislators showed up for the plenary session 
-- indicated that few parliamentarians felt a personal stake 
in the outcome of the TNI debate. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) Despite its initial victory in the TNI leadership 
controversy, the People\'s Coalition represents a collection 
of odd bedfellows that could easily disintegrate.  By October 
17, officials from two Islamist parties, the Prosperous 
Justice Party (PKS) and the Crescent Moon and Star Party 
(PBB), threatened publicly to reevaluate their support for 
the President-elect, depending on the choices he makes for 
his cabinet. 
 
6. (C) Efforts to elevate Ryamizard in the final days of 
Megawati\'s administration seemed driven by a degree of petty 
vindictiveness on the President\'s part.  Megawati appears to 
have decided against explicitly conceding her election 
defeat, meeting with Yudhoyono prior to her leaving office, 
or attending his inauguration.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Ambassador paid a farewell call on President 
Yudhoyono Oct. 21.  Yudhoyono painted a broad picture of 
needing to convince the Indonesian people on the importance 
of international cooperation and friendship as well as 
showing foreign friends that Indonesia is on the right 
path.  SBY said he sought cabinet members who would 
implement his overall goals, but conceded that his choices 
reflect concessions to his political partners.  He will lay 
out his policy goals at a Oct. 22 cabinet meeting.  On the 
Newmont case, SBY said he would meet with the Police Chief 
Oct. 22, emphasizing that neither the Ministry of 
Environment nor the WHO have detected the alleged 
pollution.  He would look into the Exxon-Mobil investment 
proposal in Cepu.  Negotiations with GAM leaders in Aceh 
have started and SBY is prepared to make concessions.  He 
views GAM leaders in Sweden as more obstructionist and may 
ask us for assistance in the future in speaking to the 
Swedes.  The GOI would watch Abu Jibril after he is 
released.  He reiterated his desire to meet President Bush 
in Santiago, and asked that we facilitate a congratulatory 
call to the U.S. election winner.  He agreed to facilitate 
early receipt of credentials for incoming Ambassador 
Pascoe.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador paid a farewell call on President 
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) October 21 at the Istana 
Palace.  Already signaling change, SBY held the meeting in 
a newly restored building that once held President 
Sukarno\'s Office.  The principle structure on the palace 
compound will now only be used for ceremonial events. 
Unlike former President Megawati, SBY was accompanied by a 
notetaker, Dino Djalal, currently Director for North and 
Cental American Affairs in the MFA, but who will clearly 
receive a position close to the new President.  After 
opening pleasantries, a serene SBY touched on some of his 
priorities. 
 
The Overall Challenge 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) Characterizing himself as someone who has learned 
much in the last few years, SBY described the ongoing 
transition in Indonesia as one of continuing to pursue 
ambitious reforms combined with the need to confront 
transnational issues such as terrorism.  Communicating this 
historic dynamic both within the government and to the 
people will be important.  Indonesia needs to recognize 
more fully that international friendship is needed, and 
that in an era of globalization, international cooperation 
is part of the solution to national problems.  The 
Indonesian people need to be convinced of this as well. 
Simultaneously, Indonesia\'s foreign friends will have to 
see that the country is in fact making correct policy 
choices. 
 
Choosing the Cabinet 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) SBY said he approached his cabinet choices, sworn in 
earlier that day (septel), with specific criteria in mind. 
He interviewed them individually and laid out for each of 
them SBY\'s view of Indonesia\'s development over the next 
five years.  \"Frankly,\" SBY said, he made concessions and 
compromises as parties in coalition with his own Democratic 
Party put forward candidates.  He described half the new 
cabinet as non-political people whom he chose freely. 
 
5. (C) At the first Cabinet meeting to be held on Oct. 22, 
SBY said that he will establish the roadmap for the new 
government and lay down the rules of the game for all the 
ministers.  He will want all of them on board with his 
leadership and said they will journey together based on 
common views.  While he made concessions in his choices, 
SBY said he would not allow anyone to highjack his freedom, 
and that he made his own decisions.  He will appoint a new 
military commander and police chief at a later stage. 
 
6. (C) He acknowledged that the strength of his popular 
mandate would help him deal with \"conflicts of interest\" 
and would help him move his policies and strategies 
forward.  Smiling at a comment by the Ambassador expressing 
surprise that the People\'s Consultative Assembly (MPR) did 
not permit SBY to speak at the swearing in ceremony (ref. 
A), SBY replied that he had a very good conversation with 
MPR Chairman Hidayat Nur Wahid encouraging him to be open 
to establishing new traditions. 
 
Encouraging Foreign Investors 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (C) The Ambassador reaffirmed our hope that SBY would 
find a means to provide a positive signal to international 
investors.  He cited the proposed Exxon-Mobil investment of 
2.3 billion dollars at Cepu as an example of a job-creating 
project that could move forward quickly.  He also cited the 
problems that Newmont is having with pollution 
allegations.  SBY responded that he would call in the Chief 
of Police Oct. 22 to discuss Newmont, noting in particular 
that neither the Ministry of Environment nor the WHO had 
found the alleged levels of pollution.  He wants the police 
to have a \"complete picture\" of the situation.  Previous 
objections by former Minister of National Development 
Planning Kwik to the Exxon-Mobil project may have been tied 
to irrelevant nationalistic feelings, SBY suggested.  He 
promised to follow-up. 
 
Aceh Discussions have Started 
----------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Communications with the GAM are under way.  SBY has 
dispatched a small team to hold conversations with Muzakir 
Manaf, Commander of GAM forces in Aceh.  SBY suggested that 
a solution could possibly be found within three months.  He 
would make economic, social and political concessions and 
that maybe amnesty would be granted to those who chose to 
voluntarily rejoin \"their brothers.\"  In response to the 
Ambassador\'s comments that GAM leaders in Indonesia seem 
more flexible than those based in Stockholm, SBY agreed, 
saying that the discussions are with leaders on the 
ground.  Acknowledging the offer for the U.S. to be helpful 
in the process, SBY said that at some point he may ask the 
U.S. to talk to the Swedish government about helping to 
\"disconnect\" the GAM leadership in Stockholm. 
 
Abu Jibril 
---------- 
 
9. (C) The Ambassador asked SBY to ensure that JI recruiter 
Abu Jibril, scheduled to be released from prison Oct. 27 
(ref. B), be closely watched by the security authorities. 
SBY responded that he would so ensure.  He added that he is 
looking into creating a task force responsible for 
monitoring dangerous individuals such as Jibril.  He said 
the idea is on his agenda to raise with the police chief 
the next day. 
 
Hopes to Meet POTUS in Santiago/Congratulate U.S. Election 
Winner 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
10. (C) SBY asked for assistance insuring that he could 
meet with President Bush at the APEC Summit in Santiago. 
He asked that we facilitate a congratulatory call to the 
winner of the U.S. Presidential elections, something he 
described as important since he had been congratulated 
after his own victory.  He expressed full understanding 
that we could not send a delegation to his inauguration at 
the last minute.  SBY mentioned he has had good 
conversations with the Thai and Malaysian Prime Ministers. 
Other ASEAN nations want Indonesia to be more active in the 
organization.  Apart from the APEC and ASEAN summits, he 
will not travel outside of Indonesia during the first 
hundred days.  Expectations from the Indonesian people are 
very high in the first 100 days, unrealistically so. 
Laughing, SBY said some think that he is a \"superman.\" 
 
New Ambassador\'s Credentials 
---------------------------- 
 
11. (C) In closing, SBY agreed to facilitate an early 
presentation of credentials after Ambassador Pascoe arrives 
in country. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (C) As in previous meeting, SBY had Dino Djalal phone 
in advance to preview the Ambassador\'s agenda.  Arriving 
from another location, SBY had a short briefing before the 
Ambassador was led in.  He will certainly be more scripted 
than his predecessor and be able, at least on paper, have 
staff follow through more effectively on his commitments. 
Events over the last 24 hours (see septel on choosing the 
cabinet) suggest that his natural inclination to 
consultation and caution will brake his stated aim to bring 
about important change.  As he noted himself, expectations 
are very high.  While he is certainly the most qualified 
Indonesian president, he will have to establish that he is 
truly a leader.  End comment

SUBJECT: INDONESIAN DEFMIN SUDARSONO ON EAST TIMOR 
ACCOUNTABILITY, MILITARY REFORM 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR B. LYNN PASCOE.  REASON: 1.4 (b, d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  In a December 13 introductory call by the 
Ambassador, Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said 
the GOI was working on a proposal to form a Commission for 
Humanitarian Reconciliation to address human rights 
violations perpetrated in East Timor in 1999.  The commission 
would consist of representatives of the GOI and East Timor, 
with the possibility of United Nations participation. 
Sudarsono candidly addressed the challenges he faced in 
imposing civilian control over the Indonesian military and 
bringing the military\'s revenues on-budget.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Minister Sudarsono noted that in a 1997 trip to 
Washington, he had given a speech at Georgetown University 
entitled \"Managing the Strained U.S.-Indonesian Bilateral 
Relationship.\"  The theme was still relevant.  Ambassador 
Pascoe replied that in general, Washington perceptions of 
Indonesia were straightforward: the U.S. recognizes the 
importance of a stable and prosperous Indonesia to the 
Southeast Asia, and the significance of Indonesia as a large 
and successful Islamic democracy.  However, the U.S. has two 
requirements for normalized military-to-military relations: 
accountability for the East Timor human rights violations in 
1999, and transparency in the military budget.  Ambassador 
noted that it was difficult to provide assistance to an 
organization whose real budget and needs are unknown. 
 
East Timor Accountability 
------------------------- 
3. (C) Sudarsono said he had recently met with President 
Yudhoyono and Foreign Minister Wirajuda to discuss East Timor 
accountability.  The GOI, he said, was seeking a \"legally 
sound and practically feasible\" approach to the problem, and 
is now considering forming a bi-national humanitarian 
reconciliation commission with members of the East Timor 
government and perhaps some representation by the United 
Nations.  Sudarsono conceded that the Indonesian judicial 
system could not meet international standards of credibility 
on human rights issues due to administrative, logistical, and 
financial shortcomings.  These had resulted in bad verdicts 
in human rights cases in East Timor and Aceh.  Moreover, 
witnesses were often uncooperative due to their fear of 
judges and prosecutors.  Sudarsono noted that any intended 
inquiry into East Timor would face vociferous opposition in 
parliament (DPR).  Ambassador suggested that a UN role on the 
commission would be appropriate, given the promise by 
Indonesia to the UN that it would maintain the security of 
the 1999 referendum.  He said he understood that any 
commission had to be pitched to the DPR as helping Indonesia 
overcome its own concerns about 1999. 
 
TNI Transparency 
---------------- 
4. (C) Turning to TNI reform, Sudarsono said that although 
the new military law foresaw a five-year period for bringing 
all military revenues on-budget, he thought that eight years 
was a more practical timeframe.  He said that the GOI had 
taken a comparative approach to the issue, looking at how 
China, Thailand, the Philippines, India, and Pakistan had 
dealt with the matter.  Sudarsono said he hoped to secure 
\"fast-track\" authority from the Ministry of Finance to 
convert larger TNI-owned business into \"semi-state-owned 
enterprises\" with the government as a partial shareholder. 
Over the longer term, the TNI\'s budget must be increased to 
make up for the resulting shortfalls in revenues.  Ambassador 
Pascoe noted that presenting a credible plan for military 
budget transparency and beginning its implementation would be 
very helpful in assuaging concerns about the TNI\'s budget 
process. 
 
5. (C) Procurement, Sudarsono said, was another challenge. 
Unlike in the past, there are now many in the military with 
the ability to make procurement deals, creating \"a room with 
many doors.\"  Many up-and-coming younger officers now were 
eager to take advantage of these lucrative opportunities.  He 
was working to bring this process under control. 
 
Civilian Control Over the Military 
---------------------------------- 
6. (C) Sudarsono turned to the challenge of consolidating 
civilian control over the military.  Indonesia had a 
successful election, but is still in the process of 
transition to democracy. The civilian government would have 
to put its house in order before it could establish supremacy 
over the military. Although he had a \"road map\" to complete 
this over a three to four year period, the task might require 
fifteen years, he said.  It was difficult, he noted, to \"add 
substance to the notion of democratic accountability.\" 
Resistance on the part of the Army was particularly stiff, he 
said.  Dealing with the other services, he said, was somewhat 
easier.  Part of the problem, Sudarsono noted, was that both 
the Minister of Defense and the Commander of the Armed Forces 
sat in the Cabinet on an equal legal basis.  Moreover, while 
the President had direct authority over deployment, the 
Minister\'s authority was confined to \"coordinating control\" 
over budgetary, strategic, and logistical matters.  He said 
he was working with his friends in the DPR to amend the 
recently passed TNI law to strengthen civilian control. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Sudarsono candidly outlined the challenges he faces in 
consolidating civilian control over the military and bringing 
its revenues on budget.  In both instances, he freely 
acknowledged the formidable hurdles posed by ingrained 
institutional culture and generational attitudes, and 
conceded that the time frames designated in the TNI bill 
might not be adequate.  On East Timor accountability, we are 
encouraged by Sudarsono\'s willingness to break from the 
oft-heard official insistence on purely national or bilateral 
mechanisms and his implicit acknowledgement that the GOI must 
seek a new way to meet international standards of 
accountability.  This was in contrast to the Coordinating 
Minister for Policy, Legal and Security Affairs later the 
same day (septel).  End comment.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Vice President Jusuf Kalla won the chairmanship of 
Golkar, Indonesia\'s largest political party, during a 
December 16-19 Party Congress, which we observed first-hand. 
Kalla\'s team paid enormous bribes to secure votes from party 
branches, but Golkar\'s draw toward executive branch power 
represented another important factor.  Kalla has dramatically 
increased his degree of influence in political life, and many 
politicians expect him to try to upstage President Yudhoyono 
and pave the way for his own presidential bid in 2009.  Many 
around Yudhoyono are nervous about Kalla\'s ascendancy. 
Yudhoyono should reap an immediate dividend, however: the 
relegation of the formal opposition \"National Coalition\" to 
minority status in the parliament.  Kalla\'s rise in Golkar 
will severely diminish the influence of former President 
Megawati, who had joined with Golkar in the National 
Coalition.  Kalla\'s victory also leaves retired General 
Wiranto with no apparent vehicle for his presidential 
ambitions.  Although former Chairman Akbar Tandjung\'s corrupt 
reputation will no longer burder the party, Golkar\'s new 
Central Board includes disreputable businessmen and retired 
General Prabowo Subianto, credibly implicated in Suharto-era 
human rights violations.  End Summary. 
 
AKBAR LOYALISTS WARN US ABOUT KALLA 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In the days leading up to the Congress, our contacts 
described increased momentum behind Jusuf Kalla\'s bid for the 
Golkar chairmanship (ref A).  Kalla cemented his position as 
incumbent Chairman Akbar Tandjung\'s lead rival late on 
December 15, when he held a joint press conference with House 
of Representatives (DPR) Chairman Agung Laksono and media 
mogul Surya Paloh -- two figures who had publicly declared 
their interest in the Golkar chairmanship.  At the press 
conference, Agung and Surya Paloh demonstrated their support 
for Kalla\'s candidacy.  Kalla announced that he had the 
support of 28 of Golkar\'s 33 provincial branches.  (Note: 
Since Golkar\'s provincial branches controlled 33 of the 36 
votes under the original rules of procedure, this claim 
indicated Kalla was on track to replace Akbar.  Our contacts 
told us Kalla\'s claim was exaggerated, but that Akbar had 
solid support from only six or seven provincial branches. 
End Note.) 
 
3. (C) Prior to the Golkar Congress opening ceremonies, 
Golkar Deputy Secretary General Bomer Pasaribu -- one of 
Akbar\'s closest allies -- warned us about Kalla\'s candidacy. 
Bomer expressed a common concern that Kalla was too close to 
radical Islamists (ref C).  He also warned that Kalla\'s 
control over Golkar would provide the Vice President with too 
much power, placing him on a par with President Yudhoyono. 
(Comment: We recognize irony in a Golkar official telling us 
that the Golkar Chairman should not be too powerful.  Bomer\'s 
warning was clearly based on his and Akbar\'s sense of 
self-interest.  End Comment.) 
 
4. (C) Contacts told us that retired military figures in 
Golkar had privately expressed concern about Kalla, 
reflecting a wariness of Islamist sentiment that appears 
common among older generation Indonesian soldiers.  Akbar 
himself reportedly privately referred to Kalla as a 
\"Taleban.\"  Subtle differences between the Congress\' opening 
ceremony and elements of other Golkar functions we have 
attended indicated Akbar Tandjung\'s desire to remind Golkar 
delegates of the party\'s secular orientation.  The woman who 
led participants in the Golkar pledge of allegiance shunned 
the Muslim headscarf she normally wears.  Figures 
representing all five Indonesia\'s official religions stood 
together during the opening prayer -- previously, only the 
Muslim leading the prayer took to the stage.  Former 
President Megawati Soekarnoputri -- one of Indonesia\'s 
leading symbols of nationalist sentiment -- attended the 
opening ceremony. 
 
AKBAR\'S APPEAL 
-------------- 
 
5. (U) In his opening speech, as well as in subsequent 
remarks from the podium, Akbar Tandjung reminded delegates 
that he had led Golkar through a difficult adjustment period. 
 He cited the party\'s reorientation in accordance with the 
reform movement that energized Indonesia in the late 1990\'s. 
He recalled fighting for Golkar when President Wahid called 
for the party\'s dissolution, and when party offices were 
burned in acts of political violence.  He highlighted 
Golkar\'s regaining a plurality in the DPR during the 2004 
elections, and its disproportionate share of DPR commission 
chairmanships.  The recent elections had given Golkar much 
influence, even though the party did not occupy strategic 
positions in the executive branch, Akbar noted, delivering a 
subtle jab at Vice President Kalla, who did not receive 
official party support for his election campaign. 
 
USING THE RULES TO AKBAR\'S ADVANTAGE 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) During December 16 debate over the Congress\' rules of 
procedure, Akbar Tandjung and his allies on the Congress 
Steering Committee pushed through a critical change, 
expanding voting rights for the mass organizations associated 
with Golkar and offering voting rights to the party\'s 440 
district-level branches.  The total number of votes in play 
therefore rose from 36 to 484, with one vote each for the 
Central Board, 33 provincial branches, 440 district branches, 
and 10 mass organizations.  This move proved widely popular, 
as the newly empowered delegates knew that candidates for the 
chairmanship would offer handsome financial incentives. 
While the revision boosted Akbar\'s popularity, his team 
members acknowledged he was forced to change the dynamic, 
because he lacked sufficient support among the provincial 
branches. 
 
7. (C) Several contacts on Akbar\'s side told us that Kalla 
lacked the Golkar experience required to fulfill the 
eligibility criteria required by draft rules of procedure. 
Steering Committee members (disproportionately pro-Akbar) 
engineered the ratification of the rules with few changes. 
Afterwards, Akbar\'s team members jubilantly told us that 
Kalla would be disqualified; Kalla\'s backers, however, 
insisted they remained confident and could document that the 
Vice President had the necessary experience, thanks to a 
period of service on South Sulawesi\'s provincial board in the 
1970\'s.  (Note: Kalla\'s curriculum vitae in the 1999-2004 
parliamentary directory listed no such experience.  End Note.) 
 
BOTH SIDES\' LAST-MINUTE MANEUVERS FAIL 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) As the vote drew closer, however, Akbar\'s team became 
more somber.  Offering voting rights to the district level 
boards had given the beleaguered Chairman a new lease on 
life, but his close associates confided to us that he could 
not afford to match the incentives Kalla offered, even as he 
twisted associates\' arms, exhorting them to raise funds. 
Furthermore, Kalla\'s team appeared undaunted by the 
eligibility criteria, and it became clear that a substantial 
number of delegates would riot in the event of the Vice 
President\'s disqualification by a verification team 
consisting of Akbar loyalists.  (Incidentally, the rule of 
procedure also disqualified retired General Wiranto from 
contesting the chairmanship.) 
 
9. (C) On the night before the chairmanship vote, Akbar\'s 
associates lobbied to break up Kalla\'s team, aiming 
particularly to secure the defection of Agung Laksono. 
(Agung, they noted, helped to offset Kalla\'s reputation as 
overly Islamic.)  Meanwhile, Kalla courted retired General 
Wiranto, who had sided with Akbar.  Akbar had offered Wiranto 
the chairmanship of Golkar\'s Board of Advisors, which would 
hold enhanced power; Wiranto also would secure seats on the 
Central Board for his loyalists (up to 40 percent of the 
Central Board\'s seats, according to one source).  Both 
coalitions held up until the end, however. 
 
THE VOTE 
-------- 
 
10. (U) As the vote approached, on the night of December 18, 
facing a storm of anxious interjections from Kalla\'s 
supporters, Congress Chairman Abdul Gafur announced that the 
verification team had difficulty confirming Kalla\'s 
eligibility for the chairmanship.  Kalla\'s nomination for the 
Vice Presidency by parties other than Golkar, along with his 
having been sanctioned by the Central Board prior to the 
presidential runoff election, called into question whether 
Kalla met the subjective requirements concerning dedication, 
loyalty, and acceptability.  Ultimately, however, the 
verification team deferred to the delegates, who would decide 
the matter with their votes. 
 
11. (U) Four candidates passed the verification phase: Akbar, 
Kalla, Golkar Vice Chairman Slamet Effendy Yusuf, and Golkar 
Vice Chairwoman Marwah Daud Ibrahim.  The Congress proceeded 
to determine which candidates had the necessary backing (a 
minimum of 150 votes) to compete for the chairmanship. 
Slamet Effendy Yusuf announced prior to this stage that he 
would withdraw from the competition.  Marwah decided to press 
on, however.  The nomination process (by sec-ret ballot) 
showed Kalla in the lead, with 269 votes, while Akbar 
received 191.  Marwah pulled in 13 votes, while two voters 
abstained and seven ballots were spoiled.  (Two branches 
failed to complete the necessary processes to vote.) 
 
12. (U) After the nomination phase, Akbar delivered a brief 
speech tracking closely with his opening remarks (para five). 
 He also highlighted his support from Wiranto, noting that 
the pair provided balance as representatives of Javanese and 
non-Javanese ethnic groups, with one being a civilian and the 
other having a military background.  Subtly reminding the 
delegates of Kalla\'s other responsibilities, he pledged to 
devote all his time to the party.  Kalla delivered brief 
remarks, departed from the podium, but then immediately 
returned onstage to acknowledge his top backers, calling on 
(in order) media mogul Surya Paloh, DPR Speaker Agung 
Laksono, Sultan Hamengku Buwono X, former Minister of Justice 
Muladi, Economic Coordinating Minister Aburizal Bakrie, 
retired General Prabowo Subianto, and House of Regional 
Representatives (DPD) Chairman Ginandjar Kartasasmita. 
 
13. (U) Around 5:30 a.m. on December 19, the final vote tally 
showed that the Congress elected Kalla to a five-year term as 
Golkar Party Chairman, 323 votes to 156.  In Kalla\'s victory 
speech, the Vice President thanked Akbar Tandjung for his 
service to the party and pledged that Golkar would continue 
to act as a counterweight to the Yudhoyono administration, 
consistent with a system of checks and balances, although the 
party would do so in an \"objective\" fashion. 
 
VOTE-BUYING 
----------- 
 
14. (C) According to multiple sources close to the major 
candidates, Kalla\'s team offered district boards at least 
200,000,000 Rupiah (over 22,000 USD) for their votes. 
Provincial boards -- which had the same voting right but also 
could influence subordinate district boards -- received 
500,000,000 Rupiah or more.  According to one contact with 
prior experience in such matters, board officials received 
down payments from both sides and would expect full payment 
from the winner, in cash, within hours of the vote.  With 243 
votes required to win a majority, the Golkar Chairmanship 
likely cost well over six million dollars, not counting the 
cost of luxury hotel rooms, plane tickets, and other expenses 
that the candidates offered to cover.  One contact claimed 
that Agung alone -- not the wealthiest of Kalla\'s backers -- 
had allocated (if not actually spent) 50 billion Rupiah (over 
5.5 million USD) on the event.  According to rumor, Economic 
Coordinating Minister Aburizal Bakrie spent 70 billion Rupiah 
(almost 8 million USD). 
 
15. (C) Money did not represent the sole factor in the 
chairmanship election, however.  Our contacts widely 
acknowledged that, besides cash, Kalla offered Golkar 
officials the chance to move from the uncomfortable role of 
opposition party to the more familiar position of supporting 
(and receiving support from) the administration.  Many of the 
district and provincial board leaders have their eyes on 
regent and governor positions that will be up for election in 
2005, and they likely hope that the Vice President, as party 
Chairman, can help their reelection efforts in symbolic or 
concrete ways that an opposition figure cannot. 
 
THE NEW GOLKAR TEAM 
------------------- 
 
16. (U) In his appointments to Golkar\'s Central Board, Kalla 
stacked the Board of Advisors with his key backers.  Media 
mogul Surya Paloh chairs the Board of Advisors.  Members 
include Economic Coordinating Minister Aburizal Bakrie, 
Sultan Hamengku Buwono X, Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris, 
retired General Prabowo Subianto, 2004 Vice Presidential 
candidate Siswono Yudo Husodo, and Kalla associate Tanri 
Abeng (a former Minister for State Owned Enterprises 
implicated -- but never charged -- in the 1999 Bank Bali 
scandal).  DPR Chairman Agung Laksono became Central Board 
Deputy General Chairman (a newly created position).  Former 
Justice Minister Muladi, former Communications Minister 
Syamsul Muarif, DPR Commission I Chairman Theo Sambuaga, 
Joyokusomo (the younger brother of Sultan Hamengku Buwono X) 
and Agus Kartasasmita (the son of Ginandjar) are among the 
party\'s Vice Chairmen. 
 
17. (C) Former Attorney General Marzuki Darusman, who was 
recently purged from Golkar along with Fahmi Idris, failed to 
return to the Central Board.  Marzuki told us Kalla held 
lingering resentment against him because he (Marzuki) had 
served as then-President Abdurrahman Wahid\'s messenger when 
Wahid fired Kalla (from his position as Minister for Industry 
and Trade) in April 2000.  Rival candidates for the 
chairmanship Slamet Effendy Yusuf and Marwah Daud Ibrahim 
were both excluded from the new Central Board.  After the 
announcement of the new Board\'s composition, a former Golkar 
executive (not included in the new Board) told us many Golkar 
officials were disappointed with the Board\'s composition. 
 
AKBAR\'S FATE 
------------ 
 
18. (C) Former Golkar Chairman Akbar Tandjung has lost his 
formal role in party affairs.  While his most loyal 
associates were purged from the Central Board, Akbar retains 
strong ties to Golkar\'s faction in parliament, having played 
a key role in constructing the party list.  While it is 
unclear how Akbar might try to return to power in Golkar, 
many expect him to begin plotting with that aim in mind.  One 
contact told us, \"Even if Akbar dies, you have to wait a week 
to be sure he doesn\'t come back.\" 
 
RAMIFICATIONS FOR MEGAWATI 
-------------------------- 
 
19. (C) The Congress outcome has dire ramifications for 
former President Megawati Soekarnoputri.  As one of the 
co-founders of the National Coalition, Megawati worked with 
Akbar Tandjung to control a majority of the seats in the DPR. 
 Prior to the Party Congress, the National Coalition 
consisted of parties representing 58 percent of the DPR. 
While Kalla stopped short of declaring the National Coalition 
dead, virtually all of our contacts are certain of Golkar\'s 
defection, which would leave the National Coalition with only 
Megawati\'s Indonesian Democratic Party - Struggle (PDI-P), 
Abdurrahman Wahid\'s National Awakening Party (PKB), and two 
smaller parties -- all in all, 186 of the DPR\'s 550 
legislators (just under 34 percent). 
 
20. (C) The failure to maintain a majority in the DPR will 
reflect poorly on Megawati; her reported drive to destroy 
Yudhoyono (politically) leaves PDI-P out in the cold so long 
as Yudhoyono is President and Megawati chairs the party. 
PDI-P\'s Party Congress is scheduled for the end of March. 
While no other figure in PDI-P can match Megawati\'s name 
recognition and appeal to grassroots voters, her opponents 
likely sense that the new political map has made her more 
vulnerable than before.  One PDI-P Central Board official, 
citing former Minister for State Owned Enterprises Laksamana 
Sukardi as her source, claimed that Megawati\'s husband, 
Taufik Kiemas, was hospitalized in serious condition upon 
hearing the news of Kalla\'s victory. 
 
WIRANTO NEEDS NEW STRATEGY 
-------------------------- 
 
21. (C) The Congress has dealt another setback to third-place 
presidential contender Wiranto.  According to former close 
associate Muladi, Wiranto took the unusual step of teaming up 
with Akbar -- who was widely recognized as having undermined 
Wiranto\'s presidential candidacy in the 2004 election -- 
because Wiranto saw he would more likely be able to use 
Golkar as his vehicle in 2009\'s presidential election if 
Akbar controlled the party, rather than Kalla.  Muladi also 
claimed Wiranto was influenced by former Golkar Chairman 
Harmoko, who dislikes Kalla. 
 
22. (C) Several of Wiranto\'s sidekicks were at the Congress 
site, including retired Generals Suaidi Marasabessy, Fachrul 
Rozi, and Tulus Sihombing.  Tulus told us after the vote that 
Wiranto\'s path to the presidency now appeared unclear.  He 
estimated that the team would take a month to recover from 
the defeat and then reexamine Wiranto\'s options for the 2009 
election.  (Note: During the Congress, we received further 
confirmation that Wiranto remained discredited by unpaid 
debts to Golkar officials -- ref A.  End Note.) 
 
YUDHOYONO HAS A NEW PROBLEM 
--------------------------- 
 
23. (C) Some representatives of political parties that backed 
Yudhoyono when the National Coalition held a majority 
publicly indicated concern that Kalla\'s victory would lead to 
an unhealthy combination of executive and legislative branch 
power.  Indeed, the Vice President, in his capacity as Golkar 
Chairman, now has the authority to fire Golkar legislators 
(including DPR Chairman Agung Laksono) if they defy the party 
line.  However, it is by no means clear that Golkar will back 
Yudhoyono\'s interests, should they conflict with Kalla\'s.  At 
the conclusion of the Congress, one Golkar legislator close 
to Agung even told us he hoped the DPR would proceed with 
earlier plans for Yudhoyono\'s interpellation (ref B). 
 
24. (C) Numerous contacts have mentioned Kalla\'s strong 
influence during the cabinet-building process.  One source 
recounted that Kalla had pounded on the table and threatened 
to resign as Vice President if Yudhoyono failed to include 
Aburizal Bakrie as Economic Coordinating Minister.  With his 
new control over Golkar and the party\'s faction in 
parliament, Kalla has added to his influence over cabinet 
members and his strong network in the business community. 
Numerous contacts cautioned that Kalla would prove more 
powerful than Yudhoyono -- particularly given his aggressive, 
hard-charging personality, which contrasts with Yudhoyono\'s 
more cautious approach (but also rubs against the grain of 
the dominant Javanese political culture). 
 
HOW YUDHOYONO DEALT WITH THE CONTENDERS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
25. (C) In the lead-up to the Congress, we heard credible 
accounts that Yudhoyono supported first Surya Paloh, then 
Agung Laksono for the Chairmanship (ref A).  He also was said 
to have offered support for Kalla\'s candidacy, as Kalla 
appeared increasingly strong.  Finally, we heard that Wiranto 
felt betrayed by Yudhoyono, because he, too, thought he had 
the President\'s backing.  These accounts indicate that, while 
Yudhoyono wanted to see Akbar Tandjung overthrown, he also 
sought to avoid a firm commitment (to a potential loser) and 
maintain maximum flexibility. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
26. (C) Yudhoyono now has a Vice President must more capable 
of aiding his administration, or acting independently on his 
own agenda.  Our contacts consistently distinguish between 
the interests of Yudhoyono and Kalla.  The Vice President\'s 
winning control of Golkar represents his own further 
accumulation of power, which he may or may not deploy on 
behalf of Yudhoyono\'s administration.  Given Kalla\'s blunt, 
no-nonsense style, we expect clear, early indications of 
Golkar\'s new orientation. 
 
27. (C) Confronted with Kalla\'s growing influence, Yudhoyono 
has several options to help offset his deputy\'s prestige.  He 
could strengthen his ties to Indonesia\'s Islamist parties, 
whose leaders have supported him up until this point and 
appear to fear being displaced by Golkar.  He could hope that 
an ally replaces Megawati in March\'s PDI-P Party Congress, so 
that Yudhoyono can strengthen his ties to that party and 
expand his secular base, as Yudhoyono\'s Democratic Party (PD) 
holds only 10 percent of the DPR\'s seats.  Finally, as a 
retired military officer, he could enhance the prestige of 
the Armed Forces, which lacks a formal role in domestic 
politics but nonetheless possesses substantial influence. 
 
28. (C) It is quite possible, however, for Kalla to decide 
that he is best off throwing his and Golkar\'s support behind 
the administration, at least for now.  As a businessman, he 
likely realizes that he, his family, and associates gain more 
from stability and effective governance than from political 
deadlock.  Additionally, Kalla\'s ethnic background, a Bugis 
from South Sulawesi, is a disadvantage for him seeking the 
presidency in a nation still dominated to an extent by the 
majority Javanese.  While we believe Kalla has an eye on the 
2009 election and we expect him to continue building up his 
political base, to some degree at Yudhoyono\'s expense, he 
would benefit from projecting an image as a constructive 
force rather than a disloyal upstart.
