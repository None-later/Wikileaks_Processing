SUBJECT: THE GULF WAR: PROSPECTS FOR PEACE OR EXPANSION 
 
REF: STATE 323960 
 
 
1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY: THE GULF WAR WILL LIKELY BUT NOT NECESSARILY REMAIN 
STALEMATED. IRAQ DOMINATES IN EVERY MAJOR WEAPONS CATEGORY AND 
HAS CONSTRUCTED FORMIDABLE DEFENSES. YET, ALL IS NOT WELL. THE 
IRANIANS CONTINUE TO MAKE INROADS EVEN WHILE PAYING DEARLY FOR 
THEM. OVER TIME THE WILL OF IRAQI FORCES TO RESIST COULD BECOME 
INCREASINGLY BRITTLE. THE STAKES INVOLVED FOR WESTERN INTERESTS 
ARE TOO VITAL TO PERMIT COMPLACENCY. AN IRANIAN VICTORY WOULD 
REDRAW THE POLITICAL AS WELL AS THE GEOGRAPHIC MAP. THE DANGER 
IS NOT THAT IRAQ\'S ACTIONS WILL SPARK A WIDER WAR BUT THAT IT 
WILL OVERESTIMATE ITS ABILITIES TO SUSTAIN A DETERMINED DEFENSE. 
IN ANY CASE, IRAN WILL NOT NOW ATTEMPT A FRONTAL ASSAULT ON 
OTHER GULF ARAB STATES BUT WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE POLICIES 
DESIGNED TO DESTABILIZE THEIR RULING REGIMES OR AT MINIMUM 
INTIMIDATE THEM INTO STRICT NEUTRALITY. FINALLY, FEARS THAT THE 
SOVIETS WILL GAIN ADVANTAGES IN IRAN AT OUR EXPENSE ARE GROSSLY 
EXAGGERATED GIVEN THE DIVERGENT POLICIES OF THE TWO STATES AND 
THVIR ANTITHETICAL INTERESTS. END SUMMARY. 
 
3. THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN A BLOODY STALEMATE FOR 
THE LAST THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS WITH IRANIAN SOLDIERS PAYING 
A TERRIBLE PRICE TO ACHIEVE MINOR TACTICAL GAINS. GIVEN IRAN\'S 
GROSS INFERIORITY IN THE FULL RANGE OF MODERN WEAPONRY AND IRAQ\'S 
FORMIDABLE, IF LARGELY STATIC, DEFENSIVE LINES, THE STALEMATE 
SHOULD CONTINUE. HOWEVER, WARS ARE NOT ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE. 
INDIVIDUAL MOTIVATION AND UNIT ESPIRIT STILL COUNT FOR A GREAT 
DEAL. IN THESE CATEGORIES, IRAN\'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS AND RAG- 
TAG BASIJ CLEARLY HOLD SWAY. MOREOVER, THE IRAQI POLITICAL LEADER- 
SHIP\'S DETERMINATION TO MINIMIZE CASUALTIES AND TO USE ITS VAST 
AIR SUPERIORITY SPARINGLY LEAVE THE INITIATIVE TO IRAN\'S FORCES 
-- A SITUATION THAT CERTAINLY MUST DEMORALIZE AT LEAST SOME OF 
THE MORE PROFESSIONAL OFFICEERS AND NON-COMS IN IRAQ\'S ARMY. 
EVEN MORE PUZZLING IS THE IRAQI ARMED FORCES\' APPARENT WILLING- 
NESS TO ALLOW THEIR ADVERSARIES TO BUILD CAUSEWAYS AND PONTOON 
BRIDGES THROUGHOUT THE VAST HUWAYZAH MARSHES WITH ONLY SPORADIC 
HARRASSMENT FROM H&I FIRE OR AIR STRIKES. MILITARY ATTACHES AND 
ADVISERS IN BAGHDAD ARE AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN IRAQ\'S PASSIVITY AND 
VIOLATION OF SOME BASIC RULES OF WARFARE. 
 
4. NEVERTHELESS, THOSE WHO MEET WITH IRAQI COMMANDERS AND MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS FIND THEM EXUDING CONFIDENCE. AND, PERHAPS, 
NOT WITHOUT REASON. MASSIVE IRANIAN OFFENSIVES HAVE BEEN BROKEN 
TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WHERE IRAQI LINES HAVE BEEN BREACHED, THE 
IRANIANS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO EXPLOIT IT BECAUSE OF INADEQUACIES 
IN PLANNING, MOBILITY, AIR, ARMOR AND ARTILLERY SUPPORT AND 
LOGISTICS. INDEED, THESE FACTORS RATHER THAN IRAQI PROWESS MAKE 
A CONTINUED STALEMATE LIKELY. 
 
5. TO CONTEMPLATE AN IRANIAN VICTORY REQUIRES THE SUPPOSITION 
THAT IRAQI FORCES AFTER SUFFERING A MAJOR, BUT INDECISIVE, 
BATTLEFIELD REVERSE, PANIC AND A GENERAL ROUT BEGINS SOMEWHAT 
ON THE ORDER OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ARVN TROOPS IN 1975. ALTHOUGH 
THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP WITH GOOD INTERIOR LINES OF DEFENSE COULD 
BE EXPECTED TO RUSH IN FRESH TROOPS TO CONTAIN THE DAMAGE, THE 
FACT IS THAT FEW FOREIGNERS HAVE ANY REAL KNOWLEDGE OF HOW IRAQI 
TROOPS WOULD HANDLE SUCH A REVERSE. WE BELIEVE THAT WHILE A 
COLLAPSE CANNOT BE RULED OUT, IT REMAINS IMPROBABLE FOR THE NEAR- 
TERM. 
 
6. YET, THE STAKES IN THIS WAR ARE SUCH THAT WESTERN COUNTRIES 
SHOULD GUARD AGAINST COMPLACENCY. EVEN IF ONE ASSIGNS THE 
IRANIANS ONLY A 10-15 PERCENT POSSIBILITY OF VICTORY, THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD CERTAINLY BE CATESTROPHIC. 
 
7. FEW DOUBT THAT KHOMEINI WANTS HIS INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM TO 
PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE REGION OR THAT HE WOULD BE SATISFIED TO 
DOMINATE IRAQ. EVEN NOW THE IRANIANS ARE SEEKING TO UNDERMINE 
SEVERAL GULF REGIMES, MOST NOTABLY IN BAHRAIN AND KUWAIT. THE 
SAUDI RULING FAMILY IS THE OBJECT OF SCORN IN TEHRAN AND THEIR 
RIGHT TO ACT AS SOLE GUARDIANS OF THE HOLY PLACES HAS BEEN CALLED 
INTO QUESTION. IRANIAN FEELINGS TOWARD KING HUSSEIN AS A CRONY OF 
THE SHAH AND MORE RECENTLY AS AN ALLY OF IRAQ HARDLY NEED 
MENTIONING. DESPITE REPORTED ISRAELI AID FOR IRAN EARLIER IN THE 
WAR AND THEIR MUTUAL ANTIPATHY FOR IRAQ, ISRAEL AND ITS RULE OVER 
JERUSALEM SERVE AS POWERFUL SYMBOLS THROUGH WHICH IRANIAN 
PROPAGANDA TRIES TO ROUSE ARAB AND NON-ARAB MUSLIMS ALIKE. THE 
ACTIONS OF IRANIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS IN LEBANON SUCH AS 
HIZBALLAH AND ISLAMIC AMAL WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IRANIAN 
VITUPERATION DIRECTED AT ISRAEL IS MORE THAN RHETORICAL. 
 
8. EVEN A VICTORIOUS IRAN WITH LESSER AMBITIONS AT MINIMUM COULD 
EXPECT TO DOMINATE OIL POLICY IN THE REGION AND FORCE A CHOICE 
AMONG GULF RULERS BETWEEN DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE U.S. OR 
EMBRACING US A NEVER BEFORE. BOTH SCENARIOS ARE INHERENTLY 
DANGEROUS AND UNSTABLE. 
 
9. IF THIS ANALYSIS IS VALID, THEN IRAQ NEEDS BOLSTERING AND 
FEARS THAT ITS ACTIONS AGAINST KHARG OR IRAN\'S INTERIOR WOULD 
SPREAD THE WAR, WHILE UNDERSTANDABLE, SHOULD BE SUBORDINATED TO 
REDUCING FURTHER THE ODDS THAT IT MIGHT LOSE. IN TRUTH IRAQ 
WAS TOO BOLD IN STARTING THIS WAR AND IS TOO TIMID IN 
PROSECUTING IT. 
 
10. THE LONGER THE WAR DRAGS ON, THE MORE LIKELY AN IRAQI 
COLLAPSE BECOMES. A KHOMEINI-LED IRAN WILL NOT WIND DOWN OR END 
THE WAR UNLESS NO OTHER VIABLE OPTION EXISTS. THIS REQUIRES IRAN 
BE DENIED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE INCOME AND ARMS. THE IRANIANS 
ARE NOT GOING TO SPREAD THE WAR BY MAKING A SUSTAINED FRONTAL 
ASSAULT AGAINST THE GULF STATES, REALIZING ALL TOO WELL WHAT THE 
CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE. RATHER, THEY CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE 
TO SEEK SUBVERSIVE ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE GULF REGION WHILE 
PROBING PRESSURE POINTS AND PRACTICING GENERAL INTIMIDATION. 
 
11. FINALLY, FEARS THAT THE SOVIETS WILL MAKE INROADS INTO IRAN 
WOULD SEEM GROSSLY EXAGGERATED. THE SOVIET UNION, NOT THE U.S., 
IS IRAQ\'S PRINCIPAL ARMS SUPPLIER; THE ENEMY OF THE MUJAHIDIN 
IN AFGHANISTAN; THE BACKER OF THE TUDEH PARTY; AND THE RULERS 
OF 40 MILLION MUSLIMS INSIDE ITS OWN BORDERS. THE SOVIETS HAVE 
HARDLY RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO RECENT IRANIAN OVERTURES LARGELY 
BECAUSE THE IDEOLOGY OF IRAN\'S RULING CLERICS PREVENTS THEM FROM 
MAKING THE SOVIETS A SUFFICIENTLY ATTRACTIVE OFFER TO SWITCH 
SIDES.-/

SUBJECT: IRAQI AIR FORCE BOMBS TEHRAN REFINERY 
 
1. (U) AS REPORTED THE RAQI AIR FORCE HAS BOMBED THE TEHRAN 
OIL REFINERY MAY 7. MILITARY COMMUNIQUE 2216 RELEASED MAY 8 
SAYS \"GROUPS OF AIRCRAFT\" FLEW TO TEHRAN AND STRUCK THE CHOSEN 
TARGETS: THE REFINERY\'S MAIN NOTHERN DISTILLING TOWER, AND 
THE CENTRAL BOILERS AND COOLING TOWER COMPLEX. THZ IRAQI AIR 
FORCE REPORTEDLY USED AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IN AUGUST 1982 
TO PLAN THE RAID, AND THE LOCAL PAPERS MAY 8 PRINT THESE 
PICTURES SIDE BY SIDE WITH PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE RECENT DESTRUCTION. 
TAKEN FROM AN ANGLE (DIRECTLY OVERHEAD), ALL THAT IS DISCERNIBLE 
ARE TWO COLUMNS OF BILLOWING BLACK SMOKE; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE 
TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS AND WASNOT HIT. 
 
2. (U) IN A MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT, AIR FORCE COMMANDER 
HAMID SHABAN BOASTED THAT THE BOMBING WAS \"THE FIRST OPERATION 
OF THIS TYPE IN ARAB HISTORY,\" BUT DID NOT ELABORATE. HE 
DECCARED THE AIR FORCE READY TO STRIKE THE IRANIANS WHERE 
AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT CHOOSES. 
 
3. (U) WE NOTE WIRE SERVICE REPORTS FROM TEHRAN THAT INDICATE 
ONLY ONE BOMB WAS DROPPED, AND THAT ON A TANK FARM. IRAQI 
NEWSPAPERS, CONVERSELY, ARE CLAIMING \"THE REFINERY WAS REDUCED 
TO ASHES\" (BAGHDAD OBSERVER), \"THE REFINERY IS NOW DEBRIS AND 
WRECKAGE\" (QADISIYA), OR SIMPLY \"DESTROYSD\" (THAWRA). 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: THIS ATTACK IS IN LINE WITH RECENT STATEMENTS 
BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE AIR FORCE COMMANDER THAT IRAQ INTENDS 
TO TAKE THE WAR TO THE ENEMY. AFTER A SIMILAR 
STRIKE AT THE ISFAHAN REFINERY MARCH 13 THE IRAQI MEDIA ALSO 
MADE SWEEPING CLAIMS, ALTHOUGH ULTIMATELY THE RAID WAS SHOWN 
TO BE LESS THAN EFFECTIVE. THIS AGAIN MAY BE THE CASE. WE 
CANNOT DISCERN EXACTLY WHAT SHABAN WAS REFERRING TO IN HIS 
COMMENT TO THE PRESIDENT, OTHER THAN, PERHAPS, MID-AIR RE- 
FUELING OF THE ATTACK AIRCRAFT. WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IS 
WHETHER THE IRAQIS FOLLOW THIS RAID UP WITH FURTHER STRIKES 
AGAINST REFINERIES OR OTHER INSTALLATIONS IN OR ADJACENT TO 
TEHRAN. MOST LIKELY THE RAID IS MEANT TO GIVE THE IRAQI PUBLIC 
A PSYCHOLOGICAL BOOST, SINCE THE IRAQIS CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO 
EMPLOY THE AIR FORCE IN A SUSTAINED MANNER AGAINST STRATEGIC 
ECONOMIC TARGETS. THE IRANIANS ARE UNLIKELY TO RETALIATE IN 
KIND FOR THIS ONE STRIKE, BUT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO 
HIT BAGHDAD IF THE IRAQIS KEEP IT UP.THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP WILL 
BE WARY OF INSTIGATING A POLICY OF STRIKES AT TEHRAN, SINCE THE 
CONSEQUENCE SURELY WILL BE A SPATE OF DEMORALIZING SCUD MISSLE 
ATTACKS ON BAGHDAD.

ARABIC TRANSLATION OF OCTOBER 25 TEHRAN RADIO INTERVIEW 
WITH RAFSANJANI IN WHICH RAFSANJANI SAID THAT NAMING THE

THE AGGRESSOR OR DEFEATING THE AGGRESSOR WILL END THE 
WAR.  AL-QAYSI ASKED RHETORICALLY WHY IRAQ SHOULD BE

AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS, CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT \"THE 
AGGRESSOR BE NAMED\" BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A CEASEFIRE,

2. (U) FOR THE RECORD, INFORMAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF 
MFA TRANSLATION OF THE INTERVIEW FOLLOWS.  BEGIN TEXT: 
 
INTERVIEW WITH RAFSANJANI 
TEHRAN RADIO 
2330, OCTOBER 25, 1987 
 
Q. MY QUESTION IS CONNECTED WITH THE GULF WAR.  THE 
UNSG HAS SUGGESTED A PLAN OF NINE POINTS TO EFFECT A 
TEMPORARY CEASEFIRE AND ESTABLISH A COURT TO JUDGE 
THE AGGRESSOR.  REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE UNSG HAS 
PASSED THEIR SUGGESTION TO OFFICIALS OF BOTY COUNTRIES 
(IRAN AND IRAQ).  WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF THIS AND WHAT 
IS THE POSITION OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN? 
 
A. WE HAVE RECEIVED SUCH A THING.  ITS CONTENT IS 
SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN REPORTED.  IT HAS 
BEEN AGREED TO ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE THE 
AGGRESSOR AND THAT IT SHOULD START ITS WORK.  IT WAS 
ALSO SUGGESTED THAT A CEASEFIRE SHOULD TAKE PLACE, BUT 
THE TIMING OF THESE TWO THINGS HAS NOT BEEN FIXED.  WE 
BELIEVE THAT A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE AFTER THE 
AGGRESSOR IS NAMED AND, IN THIS CONNECTION, THERE ARE 
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE UNSG, 
AND OTHERS.  WE DO NOT WANT TO USE DELAYING TACTICS 
AND PROLONG THE DISCUSSIONS AS SOME PARTIES EXPECT 
AND BELIEVE. 
 
FROM THE BEGINNING, WE HAVE SAID OUR LAST WORD.  WE 
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS TO END THE WAR: 
 
(1) TO NAME THE AGGRESSOR; (2) TO DEFEAT THE AGGRESSOR, 
WHICH WILL END THE WAR AUTOMATICALLY. 
 
THE FIRST WILL END THE WAR BY POLITICAL METHODS; THE 
SECOND WILL END IT BY MILITARY MEANS.  IF THE UNSC 
DOES ITS DUTY AND ACCEPTS ITS RESPONSIBILITIES, THE 
FIRST (POLITICAL METHOD) WILL PREVAIL AND COULD BE 
IMPLEMENTED.  END TEXT.

1.  (C-ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
2.  ON DECEMBER 29 AMBASSADOR CALLED ON SENIOR 
CHRISTIAN CLERIC RESIDENT IN MOSUL, CHALDEAN 
ARCHBISHOP GARMO (STRICTLY PROTECT), 
FOR DISCUSSION OF CHRISTIAN CONDITIONS IN 
MOSUL AREA. 
 
3.  GARMO TOLD US THAT HE DID NOT EXPECT ANY 
FURTHER DISTURBING OF CHRISTIAN VILLAGES.  AS 
PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, WHAT RELOCATION THERE HAS BEEN 
HAS BEEN OVER FOR WEEKS.  THE CHRISTIAN (NOT JUST 
CHALDEAN) VILLAGES TO THE NORTH OF MOSUL IN THE 
AREA AROUND TELL KAYF ARE EXISTING NORMALLY. 
(A SUBSEQUENT VISIT TO SEVERAL OF THOSE VILLAGES 
CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE CASE.) 
 
4.  THE TWO CHIEF ISSUES ON THE PATRIARCH\'S 
MIND, GARMO SAID, ARE THE CHRISTIAN DESIRE TO 
OBTAIN PERMISSION FOR CHRISTIAN TEACHING IN THE 
SCHOOLS, (THIS IS ALLOWED ONLY IF THE STUDENT 
BODY LS 51& CHRISTIAN), AND THE WISH FOR SOME 
KIND OF NEWSLETTER. 
 
5.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE PATRIARCH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE 
TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT WITH SADDAM FOR SOME 
TIME.  WHILE THE \"UNPRECEDENTED\" CHRISTMAS 
GREETINGS FROM SADDAM TO THE PATRIARCH ON 
CHRISTMAS EVE HAD RAISED HOPES, THEY WERE DASHED 
WHEN SADDAM CONTINUED TO PUT OFF THE PATRIARCH, 
BUT DID RECEIVE THE CHALDEAN ARCHBISHOP 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TINY CHALDEAN LEBANESE 
COMMUNITY. 
 
6.  LOCALLY, THE GOVERNOR IS UNFAILINGLY 
PLEASANT, BUT WILL TAKE NO INITIATIVE.  THE 
ARCHBISHOP, THEREFORE, RELIES ON THE HEAD OF 
SECURITY FOR  MOSUL, A NEW APPOINTEE 
WHO HAS SO FAR PROVED HELPFUL AND COMPASSIONATE. 
BUT THIS IS A WEAK REED, AND THE CHURCH WOULD 
NATURALLY PREFER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE TOP.  IN 
THE CASE OF SOME SERIOUS PROBLEM 
THE CHRISTIANS STILL REGARD THEIR ACE IN THE 
HOLE TO BE ADNAN KHAIRALLAH\'S FATHER, 
WHO IS ACCESSIBLE AND HAS BEEN HELPFUL DURING 
DIFFICULT TIMES IN THE PAST. 
 
7.  IN VISITING MONASTERIES AND VILLAGES NORTHEAST 
AND SOUTHEAST OF MOSUL,     EMBASSY OFFICIALS 
DID SEE MONEY BEING SPENT BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR 
THE CHRISTIANS.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SPANKING 
NEW VILLAGES, MARKED \"SADDAM MODEL VILLAGE,\" 
AND THE 4TH CENTURY MONASTERY AT MAR BAHNAM 
HAS RECEIVED AN EXPENSIVE FACELIFTING INSIDE 
AND OUTSIDE, INCLUDING EXPENSIVE NEW MARBLE FACING.

REF:  ABU DHABI 137 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  AN ARAB BUSINESSMAN IN REFTEL SAID THAT GRAND 
AYATOLLAH KHOI\'S RELATIVES IN IRAN ALLEGE THAT 
SEVENTY PERCENT OF IRANIAN SHI\'A, AND ALMOST ALL 
IRAQI SHI\'A, FOLLOW KHOI\'S INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM. 
WE HAVE RECEIVED MUCH THE SAME VERSION FROM ONE OF 
KHOI\'S SONS HERE.  WE ALSO RECALL EARLIER CONGEN 
DHAHRAN REPORTING THAT A SIMILAR PERCENTAGE OF SAUDI 
SHI\'A ADHERE TO HIM. 
 
3.  WE TOO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE RELIABLE CONFIRMATION 
OF KHOI\'S APPEAL IN IRAN.  WE ARE NOT SO SURE ABOUT 
CONGEN DUBAI\'S ASSESSMENT THAT KHOI\'S POSITION MAY 
HAVE BEEN ERODED IN IRAN.  AFTER ALL, KHOMEINI WAS 
IN NAJAF FOR FOURTEEN YEARS, WHICH DID NOTHING TO 
ERODE HIS STANDING IN IRAN.  KHOI HAS BEEN IN NAJAF 
FOR MOST OF THIS CENTURY, FOLLOWING A TRADITION OF 
IRANIAN AYATOLLAHS THAT GOES BACK TO 1722.  WE DOUBT, 
AS SUGGESTED BY REFTEL\'S SOURCE,THAT KHOI HAS COME 
TO BAGHDAD OR THAT HE IS INVOLVED IN ANY WAY IN ANTI- 
KHOMEINI BROADCASTS.  ALTHOUGH HE IS CERTAINLY NO 
FRIEND OF KHOMEINI, WHOM HE CONSIDERS AN UPSTART 
WITH DUBIOUS RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS, HE HAS STEAD- 
FASTLY REFUSED TO TAKE SIDES PUBLICLY ON THE WAR. 
 
4.  WHETHER KHOI IS ACTUALLY A THREAT TO MONTAZERI 
OR ANY OTHER POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR TO KHOMEINI IS 
ANOTHER MATTER, SINCE KHOI, WHO IS NOW AGED AND 
INFIRM, IS NO MORE POLITICALLY ORIENTED, WE UNDER- 
STAND, THAN GOLPAYEGANI.  KHOI HAS ALWAYS BEEN A 
STRONG PROPONENT OF THE QUIETIST SCHOOL OF AYATOL- 
LAHS WHO INSIST THAT CLERICS SHOULD STAY OUT OF 
GOVERNMENT.  UNLIKE KHOMEINI\'S CASE, ALLEGIANCE TO 
KHOI\'S RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATIONS DOES NOT NECESSARILY 
MEAN SUPPORT OF A POLITICAL NATURE.  THE ISSUE, AS 
REFTEL POINTED OUT, IS THAT THE LEGITIMACY OF A 
SUCCESSOR REGIME WILL DEPEND TO A MAJOR DEGREE ON 
THE PERCEPTION OF ITS RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS. 
 
5.  ONE ISSUE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO US IS THE 
PRINCIPLE OF THE USULI SCHOOL OF TWELVER SHI\'A 
ISLAM DOMINANT IN IRAN THAT RULINGS OF A CLERIC, 
NO MATTER HOW PROMINENT, LOSE THEIR VALIDITY WHEN 
HE DIES, ENTIRELY UNLIKE THE SUNNIS OR THE MINORITY 
TWELVER SCHOOL WHO HAVE A CORPUS OF CANON LAWS. 
IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT IRAN HAS A CLERGY AND 
THE ARAB STATES DO NOT IN THE SAME SENSE.  WE 
WOULD THEREFORE EXPECT THE RULINGS OF KHOI, A 
VERY TRADITIONAL CLERIC, NOT TO OUTLIVE HIM. 
WHETHER KHOMEINI\'S WILL IS THE QUESTION.  IF SO, 
HE WILL BE THE FIRST AYATOLLAH TO HAVE A \"CALIPH\"(SUCC 
ESSOR),  AND SHI\'A ISLAM IN IRAN AND ITS ROLE IN 
THE COUNTRY WILL BE CHANGED IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY.

SUBJECT:  VIEWS OF IRANIAN KURDISH LEADER QASSEMLU 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  COMING DOWN OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS FOR ONE 
OF HIS OCCASIONAL TRIPS TO BAGHDAD, IRANIAN KURDISH 
LEADER QASSEMLU MET SADDAM FEBRUARY 10.  QASSEMLU ADMITTED 
THAT INTENSE SHELLING IN THE AREA OF HIS FORMER HEADQUAR- 
TERS (DOWNRIVER FROM THE EMBATTLED TOWN OF MAWAT) HAD 
FORCED HIM RECENTLY TO MOVE 35 KILOMETERS NORTH.  HE 
CLAIMED TO HAVE 10-12,000 ACTIVE FIGHTERS AND THE 
CAPABILITY TO CALL ON MANY MORE AND TO HAVE AMPLE ARMS 
(CAPTURED FROM IRANIANS) AND MONEY (THROUGH SMUGGLING). 
HE MADE AN APPEAL FOR U.S. \"MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT,\" 
NOTING THAT HIS PARTY HAS ALWAYS STRONGLY DISAPPROVED OF 
HOSTAGE-TAKING.  THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR HAS APPROACHED 
HIM ON BEHALF OF KIDNAPPEES HELD BY TALABANI AND HE IS 
HOPEFUL THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO GET THEM FREED. 
 
3.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED HIS RELATIONS WITH TALABANI AS 
GOOD, ALTHOUGH HIS POLICY OF STRICT NEUTRALITY BETWEEN 
TALABANI AND THE IRAQIS SOMETIMES CAUSES FRICTION. 
QASSEMLU RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR AN ALLIANCE WITH OTHER 
IRANIAN OPPOSITION GROUPS, BUT RAJAVI--WHOM  HE DESCRIBED 
AS AN \"AMATEUR\"--SEEMS UNWILLING.  RAJAVI\'S LIMITED 
MILITARY ACTIONS IN THE NORTH COMPLICATED QASSEMLU\'S 
RELATIONS WITH TALABANI, AND RAJAVI WILL NOW MOVE HIS 
EFFORTS SOUTH.  UNLIKE RAJAVI, QASSEMLU AVOIDS EVER 
BEING PHOTOGRAPHED WITH SADDAM.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED THE 
SITUATION IN IRANIAN KURDISTAN AS STABLE, WHILE THE 
SITUATION IN IRAQI KURDISTAN HAS \"SHARPLY DETERIORATED\" 
(I.E., FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY IN 
BAGHDAD) DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS.  THE IRAQI 
VILLAGE DESTRUCTION CAMPAIGN HAS NOT YET BEEN MIRRORED 
ON A LARGE SCALE IN IRAN.   END SUMMARY 
 
4.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 1988 CONGRESS OF THE DEMOCRA- 
TIC PARTY OF KURDISTAN OF IRAN (KDPI), SECRETARY GENERAL 
A.R. QASSEMLU (WHO SPELLS HIS NAME GHASSEMLOU) CAME DOWN 
FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO MEET SADDAM HUSSEIN  FEBRUARY 10. 
BECAUSE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF IRANIAN KURDS IN SWEDEN AND 
FRANCE, QASSEMLU TYPICALLY CONTACTS THE SWEDISH AND 
FRENCH AMBASSADORS WHEN HE MAKES TRIPS TO BAGHDAD, EVERY 
FIVE TO SEVEN MONTHS.  POLCHIEF LOBBIED SWEDLSH AMBASSADOR 
THOREN FOR A MEETING WITH QASSEMLU AND WAS INVITEO TO A 
SIX-HOUR LUNCH FEBRUARY 12.  QASSEMLU CAME ACROSS AS EX- 
TREMELY OPEN, SOPHISTICATED, AND ARTICULATE, EVEN IN 
ENGLISH WHICH IS ONLY HIS SIXTH-BEST LANGUAGE (AFTER 
KURDISH, PERSIAN, ARABIC, FRENCH, AND CZECH).  HE WAS 
ACCOMPANIED BY THE DIRECTORS OF THE KDPI\'S PARIS, 
STOCKHOLM,  AND BAGHDAD OFFICES (ABDULLAH GHEDERI, 
EBRAHIM DJEURABESKA, AND SALAM AZIZI). 
 
------------------------------- 
APPEAL FOR MORAL SUPPORT 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  QASSEMLU MADE A STRONG APPEAL FOR AMERICAN \"MORAL 
AND POLITICAL SUPPORT.\"  HE OBSERVED THAT THE KDPI HAS 
ALWAYS HAD A POLICY OF STRONGLY OBJECTING TO TERRORISM 
AND HOSTAGE-TAKING, AND HE PROVIDED POLCHIEF WITH A 
PAPER HE HAD RECENTLY PRESENTED (THROUGH HIS REPRESEN- 
TATIVE) AT A PARIS SYMPOSIUM ON TERRORISM, IN WHICH HE 
OBJECTED TO TERRORISM AS A TOOL FOR REVOLUTIONARY 
LIBERATION GROUPS.  HE CLAIMED TO BE PERPLEXED THAT 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS RECEIVED \"A 
RAGTAG BUNCH OF BACKWARD AFGHAN FUNDAMENTALISTS\" AND 
PERSISTS IN TRYING TO BOLSTER \"NONVIABLE NICARAGUAN 
GROUPS,\" WHILE NOT AFFORDING ATTENTION TO \"TRUE 
DEMOCRATIC GROUPS\" WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR \"UNIVERSALLY 
RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS.\" 
 
6.  POLCHIEF OBSERVED THAT THERE IS PUBLIC SYMPATHY 
FOR THE KURDISH SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES BUT NOT 
VERY MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT IT; QASSEMLU MIGHT DO WELL TO 
CULTIVATE JOURNALISTS.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT ONE OF THE 
THINGS HE HAD DONW WHILE IN BAGHDAD THIS TIME WAS TO 
PUSH THROUGH A VISA FOR THE WASHINGTON POSO\'S  JONATHAN 
RANDAL (PARIS), WHO HE SAID IS WRITING A BOOK ABOUT 
KURDS AND TO WHOM HE HAS GIVEN FOURTEEN HOURS OF 
INTERVIEW.  QASSEMLU LAMENTED THAT \"THE SOVIETS ALWAYS 
TEND TO SEE THE KDPI AS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICANS AND 
THE AMERICANS ALWAYS SUSPECT THE SOVIETS\" WHILE IN 
FACT THE KDPI HAS NO FRIENDS.  \"OUR ONLY FRIENDS  ARE 
THE MOUNTAINS.\" 
 
------------------------ 
ITALIAN HOSTAGES 
------------------------ 
 
7.  QASSEMLU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD JUST MET ITALIAN 
AMBASSADOR TOSCANO AND GIVEN HIM A PLEDGE TO DO WHAT HE 
COULD ABOUT THE THREE ITALIAN KIDNAPPEES BEING HELD BY 
TALABANI\'S PATRIOTIC UNION OF KURDISTAN (PUK).  HE 
NOTED THAT HE HAD INTERVENED OCCASIONALLY IN THE PAST, 
HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN INFLUENCING TALABANI TO RELEASE 
HOSTAGES, AND HE \"HAD EVERY CONFIDENCE\" THAT HE WOULD 
BE SUCCESSFUL AGAIN. (HE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THS 
WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE ITALIANS HAD APPROACHED HIM 
AND THUS HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY MADE ANY EFFORTS 
ON THE CIVILIAN\'S BEHALF.)  QASSEMLU BETRAYED A TRACE OF 
ANNOYANCE THAT OTHER GROUPS\' WILLINGNESS TO RESORT TO 
TERRORISM HAD GAINED THEM GREATER ATTENTION THAN THAT 
GIVEN THE KDPI, EVEN THOUGH THE KDPI, HE CLAIMED, IS 
A \"MUCH MORE FIRMLY AND WIDELY BASED ORGANIZATION.\" 
 
------------------------------- 
KDPI BASE OF SUPPORT 
------------------------------- 
 
8.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT HE HAS 10-12,000 ACTIVE FIGHTERS 
AND \"CANNOT HANDLE\" ANY MORE THAN THAT FOR LOGISTICAL 
JEXNSJM  WHENEVER HE NEEDS, HE CAN CALL UP \"SEVERAL 
MULTIPLES\" OF THAT FIGURE.  HE CLAIMED THAT HE HAS NO 
REAL COMPETITION FOR INFLUENCE AMONG IRANIAN KURDS 
(\"80 PERCENT ARE BEHIND ME\") AND HE SCOFFED AT THE 
SITUATION IN IRAQ:  \"THERE IS NOTHING SIMILAR IN IRAN 
TO A (KURDISH) TAHA MA\'RUF AS \'VICE PRESIDENT\' OR THE 
KURDS THAT HOLD MINISTRIES HERE.  THERE IS NOTHING 
LIKE THE HUGE NUMBERS OF \'JAHASH\'\" (THE PEJORATIVE 
TERM FOR THE KURDISH TRIBAL FORCES HELD BY VHENIRAIE 
(##) --AND THUS BECOME SOMETHING EQUIVALENT TO THE 
\"JAHASH.\"). 
 
9.  IN HIS APPEAL FOR AMERICAN \"MORAL AND POLITICAL 
SUPPORT,\" QASSEMLU STRESSED THAT HE WAS NOT CALLING 
FOR MONEY OR ARMS.  \"OF COURSE ONE ALWAYS LIKES MORE, 
BUT WE HAVE PLENTY.\"  HE CLAIMED THAT THE KDPI HAS, 
OVER THE YEARS, BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE AMPLE ARMS FROM 
THE IRANIAN URMY/PASDARAN.  HE WAS RELUCTANT TO GO INTO 
HIS FINANCIAL SOURCES, CLAIMING ONLY THAT \"EVERY FAMILY 
IN KURDISTAN MAKES VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS,\" BUT IN THE 
COURSE OF CONVERSATION IT BECAME CLEAR THAT BOTH THE 
KDPI AND PUK SUSTAIN THEMSELVES IN LARGE PART THROUGH 
SMUGGLING.  QASSEMLU SAID THAT HE \"ONLY\" CJARGES A 
\"THREE PERCENT DUTY\" ON GOODS PASSING FROM IRAQ INTO 
IRAN, AS OPPOSED TO \"AS MUCH AS TWENTY PERCENT\" LEVIED 
BY TALABANI.  EXAMPLES OF GOODS GOING INTO IRAN 
INCLUDE WHISKEY AND VIDEOS AND OF GOODS GOING INTO 
IRAQ, CARPETS AND PISTACHIOS.  FORMERLY TEA CAME FROM 
IRAQ AND SUGAR FROM IRAN, BUT LATELY BOTH TEA AND 
SUGAR HAVE BEEN MOVING FROM IRAQ INTO IRAN.  QASSEMLU 
SAID THAT HE HAD RECENTLY ASKED TALABANI HOW LONG HE 
COULD SURVIVE FINANCIALLY IF HIS MONETARY SOURCES 
SUDDENLY DRIED UP, AND TALABANI SAID, \"TWO MONTHS,\" 
WHEREAS QASSEMLU CLAIMED HE WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY 
GOING ON FOR \"AT LEAST TWO YEARS.\" 
 
10.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN IRANIAN 
KURDISTAN AS \"STABLE,\" I.E., MUCH THE SAME AS IT HAS 
XBEEN FINCE 1980 WHEN THE KDPI LOST ITS CONTROL OVER 
THE CITIES AND CHANGED FROM CONVENTIONAL WARFARE TO 
GUERRILLA TACTICS.  THE IRANIANS CONTROL THE CITIES 
VNOW BUT ONLY CONTROL THE MAIN HIGHWAYS FROM EIGHT TO 
FVE; TE KDPI TACES OVER AT NIGHT.  QASSEMLU PRO\' 
XFESSED TO BE \"OPTIMISTIC\" ABOUT THE FUTURE, SINCE HIS 
SUPPORT IN IRANIN KURDISTAN IS \"ROCK-SOLID.\"  HE SAID 
THAT HE ISHPREPARED TO HOLD OUT IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR 
25 YEARS, BUT IF KHOMEINI DIES SOON \"THERE MAY BE 
CONSIDERABLE TURMOIL IN TEHRAN,\" AND THE IRANIAN 
ECONOMY IS \"IN A TAILSPIN.\"  WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE 
OR TALABANI AND BARZANI CONTROLLED MORE TERRAIN, 
QASSEMLU SAID THAT THREE YEARS AGO HE DID, BUT NOW 
THE IRAQI KURDS DO.  THE REASON, HE EXPLAINED, IS 
NOT THAT HE IS DOING WORSE--TO THE CONTRARY HE IS 
HLDING HIS OWN--IT IS RATHER THAT THE SITUATION FOR 
THE BAGHDAD REGIME IN IRAQI KURDISTAN HAS \"DETERIOKA- 
TED SO SHARPLY\" OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. (#) 
CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING 
TALABAMI AND SADDAM TOGETHER FOR PROLONGED NEGOTIA- 
TIOS TH YEARS AGO, WHICH BROKE DOWN. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
COMPELLED TO MOVE HEADPUARTERS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
11.  QASSEMLU ADMITTED THAT HE HAD RECENTLY BEEN OBLIGED 
TO MOVE HIS HEADQUARTERS.BECAUSE OF INTENSE IRANIAN 
SHELLING.  HIS FORMER HEADQUARTERS--HE POINTED OUT ON AN 
UNFORTUNATELY NOT VERY DETAILED MAP--APPEARS TO HAVE 
BEEN NEAR THE LESSER ZAB RIVER WHERE IT FLOWS INTO IRAQ 
(APPROXIMATELY 3601N 4520E).  HE HAD HAD A LARGE HOSPI- 
TAL TYERE TO WHICH FRENCH DOCTORS CAME EVERY MONTH, AND 
OFTEN THE KDPI WAS PUT IN THE ANOMOLOUS SITUATION OF 
HAVING BOTH TALABANI AND IRAQI ARMY CASUALTIES AT THE 
HOSPITAL AT THE SAME TIME.  THE LOCALS BECAME UNTENABLE 
BECAUSE THE IRANIAN ARMY WAS JUST TO THE EAST, THE IRAQI 
ARMY JUST TO THE WEST, AND TALABANI\'S FORCES BEHIND THE 
IRAQI ARMY FURTHER TO THE WEST--\"EVERYBODY WAS POUNDING 
EVERYBODY.\"  NOW HE HAS MOVED TO A POINT (APPROXIMATELY 
3620N 4515E) SOME THIRTY-FIVE KILOMETERS TO THE NORTH, 
AGAIN RIGHT ON THE IRANIAN BORDER SO THAT QASSEMLU 
SPENDS MUCH OF HIS TIME ON THE IRANIAN SIDE (HE CLAIMS), 
BUT WHERE THE IRAQI ARMY IS MUCH FURTHER AWAY TO ZHE 
WEST.  THUS, HIS HEADQUARTERS NOW APPEARS TO BE IN A 
KIND OF NO-MAN\'S-LAND WHERE THE KDPI HAS FULL SWAY. 
HE SAYS HE HAS REBUILT THE HOSPITAL THERE AND THE 
FRENCH DOCTORS CONTINUE TO COME. 
 
12.  ON FIGHTING AT MAWAT ON THE GOGASUR RIVER JUST TO 
THE SOUTH OF WHERE HIS FORMER HEADQUARTERS WAS, QASSEMLU 
SAID THAT THE IRANIAN OBJECTIVE IS TO CLEAR TALABANI\'S 
EAST-WEST ACCESS.  TALABANI\'S HEADQUARTERS, HE CLAIMED, 
IS LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF MAWAT (SOMEWHERE VAGUELY IN THE 
VALLEY OF THE SHILER RIVER WHICH MEETS THE GOGASUR 
SOUTH OF MAWAT, APPROXIMATELY AT 3547N 4540E).  THE 
IRANIANS CONTROL THE RIDGE OVERLOOKING MAWAT TO THE EAST, 
THE IRAQIS CONTROL THE HILLS SOUTHWEST OF MAWAT, AND 
THERE HAS BEEN MUCH FIGHTING THERE AND IN THE MOUNTAIN 
WEST OF MAWAT WHICH THE IRANIANS PARTIALLY CONTROL. 
JUST THAT MORNING QASSEMLU RECEIVED A CALL FROM HIS 
HEADQUARTERS THAT THE IRAQIS HAD JUST LAUNCHED A NEW 
ATTACK ON THE IRANIAN POSITIONS WEST OF MAWAT.  MAWAT 
ITSELF, \"LIKE PANJWIN,\" QASSEMLU COMMENTED, IS 
COMPLETELY ABANDONED. 
 
-------------------------------- 
RELATIONS WITH TALABANI 
-------------------------------- 
 
13.  QASSEMLU CLAIMED TO BE \"VERY GOOD FRIENDS\" WITH 
TALABANI.  RECENTLY HE HAD ASKED TALABANI TO PICK UP 
SOME CAVIAR FOR HIM FROM THE CASPIAN, AND WHEN TALABANI 
BROUGHT IT TO HIM HE JOKED THAT HE HAD HAD TO GO 
THROUGH SPECIAL CHANNELS TO GET MORE CAVIAR THAN IS NOW 
USUALLY PERMITTED AND IF THE IRANIAN AUTHORITIES HAD 
KNOWN WHOM IT WAS FOR \"THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN APOPLECTIC.\" 
QASSEMLU ADMITTED THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN DELICATE 
ISSUES ARISE.  FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY 52 IRAQI SOLDIERS, 
INCLUDING SIX OFFICERS, HAD TAKEN REFUGE WITH THE KDPI 
AND TALABANI HAD DEMANDED THAT THEY BE HANDED OVER. 
THE DISPUTE WENT ON FOR TWO WEEKS BUT QASSEMLU WAS 
ADAMANT THAT THE KDPI MUST REMAIN \"ABSOLUTELY NEUTRAL\" 
IN ALL MATTERS BETWEEN IRAQIS AND KURDS, AND HE EVENTU- 
ALLY HANDED THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS BACK TO THE 
IRAQI ARMY.  QASSEMLU, WHO WHILE BEING REMARKABLY OPEN 
ALSO TENDED TO CHOOSE HIS WORDS CAREFULLY, WAS UNWILL- 
ING TO BE DRAWN OUT ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH 
MAS\'UD BARZANI, BUT HE RIDICULED THE IDEA THAT THE 
BARZANIS\' \"KDP\" WAS EVER \"A REAL PARTY.\"  \"THEY ARE 
MERELY A TRIBE.\" 
 
---------------------------------- 
SADDAM IS IN CHARGE 
---------------------------------- 
 
14.  QASSEMLU WAS UNWILLING TO DISCUSS HIS MEETING WLTH 
SADDAM, INDEED EVEN DIRECTLY TO ADMIT IT TOOK PLACE 
(ALTHOUGH PRIVATELY TO THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR HE HAD 
BEEN MORE CANDID), ALTHOUGH HE DID ALLUDE TO THE 
PERSIAN SAYING THAT \"IF YOU CAN MEET GOD, THERE IS NO 
POINT IN SETTLING FOR ONE OF THE TWELVE IMAMS.\" 
QASSEMLU SAID THAT, UNLIKE MUJAHEDIN E-KHALQ LEADER 
RAJAVI, HE HAD \"ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE\" TO BE PHOTO- 
GRAPHED WITH SADDAM OR HAVE ANY PUBLICITY OF HIS TRAVEL 
TO BAGHDAD, MUCH LESS OF MEETING SADDAM--\"IT DOES NOT 
GO OVER VERY WELL IN IRAN.\"  POLCHIEF PRESSED HIM ON 
WHO IN IRAQ IS IN CHARGE OF KURDISH ISSUES, AND 
QASSEMLU SAID, \"SADDAM.  HE IS IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING.\" 
THAT ASIDE, HOWEVER, HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT IN DAY-TO- 
DAY AFFAIRS, \"THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN IRAQ: 
SADDAM; \'ADNAN (KHAYRALLAH, MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND 
FIRST COUSIN AND BGOTHER-IN-LAW OF SADDAM), WHO IS IN 
CHARGE OF THE SOUTH; AND \'ALI HASAN (AL-MAJID, PATER- 
NAL COUSIN AND LOOK-ALIKE OF SAWAAV0| WHO IS IN UHAR3 
RGFITHE NORTH.\"  HOWEVER, QASSEMLU INDICATED HE DID NOT 
SEE \'ALI HASAN, HEADQUARTERED IN KIRKUK, VERY OFTEN, 
APPARENTLY BECAUSE QASSEMLU NEVER SETTLES FOR LESS 
THAN \"GOD.\" 
 
-------------------------------- 
VILLAGE DESTRUCTION 
-------------------------------- 
 
15.  POLCHIEF ASKED QASSEMLU FOR HIS REACTION TO THE 
IRAQI CAMPAIGN OF DESTROYING KURDISH VILLAGES. 
QASSEMLU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT \"MOST\" VILLAGES HAVE BEEN 
DESTROYED BUT HE SEEMED UNEMOTIONAL ON THE POINT. 
POLCHIEF ASKED IF THE CAMPAIGN HAD HAD THE EFFECT OF 
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF GUERRILLAS AND REFUGEES.  HE 
ANSWERED THAT IT HAD \"GREATLY\" INCREASED THE NUMBER 
OF UERRILLAS BUT NEITHER HE NOR TALABANI ENCOURAGED 
THE IDEA OF REFUGEES INTO THE OTHER\'S TERRITORY, 
BECAUSE OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN FEEDING AND CARING 
FOR PEOPLE.  THE NET EFFECT OF THE IRAQI VILLAGE DES- 
TRUCTION CAMPAIGN, HE ACKNOWLEDGED, IS THE ALMOST 
COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THE IRAQI KURDS\' TRADITIONAL 
AGRARIAN WAY OF LIFE.  KURDISH MEN IN IRAQ HAVE 
ONLY TWO CHOICES, TO GO TO THE CITIES OR TO STAY: IN 
NEWLY CONSTRUCTED CENTERS WHERE THE ONLY LIVELIHOOD IS 
TO BE \"JAHASH.\"  QASSEMLU SAID THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE 
SO FAR ONLY DESTROYED 25 VILLAGES, OUT OF OVER SEVEN 
THOUSAND IN IRANIAN KURDISTAN (AND A CLAIMED KURDISH 
POPULATION IN IRAN OF SEVEN MILLION), BUT HE COMMENTED, 
\"ALAS, EACH SIDE TENDS TO LEARN BAD HABITS FROM THE 
OTHER.\"   ONE BAD HABIT THAT HE CLAIMED THE IRANIANS 
HAVE (#) IS THE USE OF CHEMICUL WEAPONS.  \"BOTH 
SIDES DO IT, ALTHOUGH THE IRAQIS MUCH MORE.\"  POLCHIEF 
ASKED WHETHER, GIVEN THE DENUDED NATURE OF MOST OF 
KURDISTAN, HELICOPTERS AND OTHER AIRBORNE ATTACKS POSE 
A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE PESHMERGA.  QASSEMLU SAID, 
\"NEITHER WE NOR THE IRAQI KURDS ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
HELICOPTERS.  WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM.  BUT ARTILLERY 
IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR US.  AND CHEMICAL WARFARE IS 
A PROBLEM TOO.\" 
 
----------------------------- 
A KURD\'S VIEW OF IRAQ 
----------------------------- 
 
16.  QASSEMLU DID NOT GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO CRITICIZE IRAQ, 
BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST A BARRAGE OF CUTTING REMARKS THAT 
CLEARLY SHOWED HIS DISDAIN FOR ARABS AND FOR THE IRAQI 
REGIME.  IN PARTICULAR, HE SAID THAT HE VERY MUCH DISLIKED 
BAGHDAD AND AVOIDED COMING UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. 
HE GRUDGINGLY ADMITTED THAT IRAN IS A MORE FLUID AND 
DYNAMIC SOCIETY--\"YES, IN URMIA PEBPLE CAN PICKIUP THE 
PHONE TO THE UNITED STATES ANY TIME THEY WANT, AND THEY 
ARE FREE TO TRAVEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY,\" HE SAID WISTFULLY 
--BUT HE WAS QUICK TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE IS MUCH LESS 
INTERFERENCE IN PEOPLE\'S PRIVATE MORALS IN IRAQ AND THAT 
IRAQ STANDS FOR \"MORE MODERN IDEAS.\"  HE HAD DETESTED THE 
SHAH, \"BUT KHOMEINI IS MUCH WORSE.\"  HE HAD SEEN KHOMEINI 
TWICE IN 1979 AND BEEN \"LIED TO SHAMELESSLY.\"  QASSEMLU 
PROCEEDED TO GIVE A LECTURE ON THE SHI\'A PRACTICE OF 
\"TAQIYA\" (DECEIT TO SERVE A HIGHER PURPOSE) AS AN 
PNGRAINED PART OF THE SHI\'A PERSONALITY; POLCHIEF NOTED 
THAT WE HAD RECENTLY LEARNED A FEW LDSSONS ON THE SUBJECT 
OURSELVES. 
 
------------------------ 
RAJAVI 
------------------------- 
 
17.  QASSEMLU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE KDPI IS IN NEED OF 
ALLIANCES WITH OTHER IRANIAN OPVBSITION GROUPS, SINCE 
BY ITSELF IT OBVIOUSLY CANNOT OVERTHROW THE REGIME.  HE 
ADMITTED THAT THE REGIME HAS WIDE SUVPORT (\"HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF MULLAHS WHO ALL SEE THEIR LIVELIHOOD AT 
STAKE\") AND ITS OVERTHROW WILL BE NO EASY MATTER.  POL- 
CHIEF ASKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE ALLIANCE WITH RAJAVI WHO, 
IN ANY CASE, HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN  MOUNTING MILITARY 
ACTIONS IN THE NORTH.  QASSEMLU DESCRIBED RAJAVI AS 
AN \"AMATEUR,\" WHO HAS 1200 FIGHTERS \"AT THE MOST\" BUT 
HAS A GOOD PROPAGANDA MACHINE.  HE ADMITTED THAT RAJAVI 
\"HAD TRIED A FEW ACTIONS IN THE NORTH,\" BUT UNLIKE THE 
KDPI THE MUJAHEDIN E-KHALQ \"HAVE NO REAL STRENGTH IN 
PLACE IN IRAN.\"  \"IN FACT, OF ALL THE OPPOSITION GROUPS,\" 
QASSEMLU CLAIMED, \"ONLY MY PARTY HAS SIGNIFICANT STRENGTH 
INSIDE IRAN.\"   QASSEMLU SAID THATSRAJAVI\'S RECENT 
ACTIONS IN THE NORTH HAD CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR THE KDPI, 
BECAUSE IT HAD ON OCCASION ENGAGED TALABANI\'S FORCES. 
QASSEMLU SAID THAT HENCEFORTH RAJAVI WILL NOT BE 
OPERATING IN THE NORTH BUT HAS NOW SWITCHED TO THE 
SOUTH.  HE ADMITTED THAT RAJAVI \"IS APPARENTLY NOT EAGER 
FOR ANY ALLIANCES.\"  \"RAJAVI HAS VISIONS OF GRANDEUR; 
HE THINKS HE IS ABLE TO CARRY IT BY HIMSELF.\" 
 
------------------------------- 
KDPI CONGRESS 
------------------------------- 
 
18.  IN AN ASIDE, THE KDPI PARIS REPRESENTATIVE (WHO 
WITH HIS COLLEAGUE IN STOCKHOLM WAS TO RETURN TO 
EUROPE FEBRUARY 15) SAID THAT \"APPROXIMATELY 200\" 
PARTY REPRESENTATIVES HAD APPEARED FOR THE CONGRESS, 
HELD AT THE NEW PARTY HEADQUARTERS.  THE CONGRESS HAD 
ALWAYS PREVIOUSLY BEEN BIENNIAL, BUT BECAUSE OF THE 
ENORMOUS DIFFICULTIES FACED BY MANY OF THE PARTY 
MEMBERS IN MAKING THE JOURNEY FROM OUTLYING PARTS OF 
IRANIAN KURDISTAN OVER THE BORDER TO THE HEADQUARTERS 
IN IRAQ, IT HAS NOW BEEN DECIDED NOT TO HAVE THE NEXT 
CONGRESS FOR THREE YEARS.  QASSEMLU, WHILE REPEATEDLY 
STRESSING THE DEMOCRATIC NATURE OF HIS PARTY AND ITS 
POLICIES  (AND HE CLARIFIED THAT HE MEANT \"DEMOCRATIC\" 
IN THE WESTERN RATHER THAN EASTERN SENSE), ADMITTED 
THAT HE HAD HAD NO OPPONENT FOR POSITION OF SECRETARY 
GENERAL.  POLCHIEF ASKED WHETHER ANY KDPI REPRESENTA- 
TIVES FROM THE U.S. HAD PARTICIPATED, AND THE REPLY 
WAS THAT WHILE ONE HAD ATTENDED THE PREVIOUS CONGRESS, 
NONE CAME THIS  TIME. 
 
------------------------------------ 
KOMALA 
------------------------------------ 
 
19.  THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR DISPLAYED CONSTERNATION 
THAT TWO WEEKS AGO HE HAD GIVEN A PROMINENT IRANIAN 
KURDISH FIGURE, SHAYH \'IZZ AL-DIN HUSAYNI, A TOURIST 
VISA TO SWEDEN, AND NOW HE IS ASKING FOR ASYLUM.  THE 
VISA HAD BEEN REQUESTED ON HIS BEHALF BY HIS SON-IN-LAW, 
NAMED CHAMSI, THE BAGHDADREPRESENTATIVE OF KOMALA 
(SMALL MARXIST IRANIAN KURDISH GROUP).  QASSDMLU 
DISCOUNTED SHAYKH HUSAYNI\'S RELIGIOUS IMPBRTANCE AND 
THE IMPORTANCE OF KOMALA. 
 
----------------------------- 
BIOGRAPHICS 
----------------------------- 
 
20.  QASSEMLU (GHASSEMLOU) WAS BORN IN 1930.  HIS EARLY 
EDUCATION WAS IN URMIA BUT HE ALSO ATTENDED THE AMERICAN 
COLLEGE IN TEHRAN.  HE WENT TO UNIVERSITY IN PARIS BUT 
WAS EXPELLED FROM IRAN (#) REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES. 
HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP AT THE UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE, AND HE WAS 
AN ECONOMICS PROFESSOR IN PRAGUE FOR TWENTY YEARS.  HE 
DEPARTED WHEN THE SOVIETS MARCHED IN IN 1968.  OFF AND 
ON DURING THE 1970S HE SERVED AS AN ECONOMIST IN THE 
MINISTRY OF PLANNING IN BAGHDAD, DURING WHICH HE 
AUTHORED A MAJOR OVERALL ECONOMIC PLAN FOR IRAQ, HE 
CLAIMS.  OF MEDIUM HEIGHT AND SLENDER BUILD, HIS HAIR 
IS GRAYING BUT HE MOVES WITH THE QUICKNESS AND AGILITY 
OF A YOUNGER MAN.  HE TELLS A GOOD ANECDOTE AND PEPPERS 
HIS CONVERSATION WITH CONSTANT HUMOR.

SUBJECT:  KURDISH INSURGENCY IN IRAQ AND TURKEY 
 
1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  TRAINING CAMPS FOR PKK IN IRAN ARE A 
GROWING WORRY FOR TURKEY AND, ACCORDING TO TURKISH 
AMBASSADOR, HAVE BEEN A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION IN RECENT 
IRANIAN-TURKISH MEETINGS.  BARZANI\'S KDP, APPARENTLY 
IN SOME DISARRAY, HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO REIN IN THE 
PKK, WHICH HAS ACTIVELY BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH 
TALABANI\'S PUK.  THE TURKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT 
POSSIBLE DELIVERY OF WEAPONS TO PKK BY THE IRAQIS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ACCORDING TO TURKISH AMBASSADOR KOKSAL, ONE OF 
THE TOP  ITEMS ON THE AGENDA DURING THE IRANIAN 
MINISTER OF INTERIOR\'S RECENT VISIT TO ANKARA WAS 
IRANIAN SUPPORT OF THE PKK INSURGENTS BY PROVIDING 
THEM TRAINING CAMPS IN IRAN AND BY ASSISTING THEM 
IN THEIR IRAQI SANCTUARIES.  (ANOTHER TOP PRIORITY, 
KOKSAL SAID, WAS THE PROBLEM OF THE LARGE IRANIAN 
REFUGEE POPULATION.)  IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR THE PKK 
IS A DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS ONLY BEEN NOTICED OVER 
THE PAST YEAR, AS THE IRANIAN EMPHASIS PREVIOUSLY 
WAS IN SUPPORTING FUNDAMENTALIST POLITICAL PARTIES 
IN TURKEY.  THESE NEVER GARNERED SUFFICIENT POPULAR 
ENTHUSIASM, SO THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO BE TRYING A NEW 
TACTIC. 
 
4.  KOKSAL SAID THAT, DESPITE ASSURANCES TO TURKEY 
THAT IT WOULD NOT GIVE ANY AID TO THE PKK, ELEMENTS 
OF MASOUD BARZANI\'S KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF IRAQ 
HAVE BEEN AIDING THE PKK, EVEN AS OTHERS OF ITS 
ELEMENTS ARE BEING ATTACKED BY THE PKK.  KOKSAL 
ATTRIBUTED THE PROBLEM TO MASOUD\'S POOR CONTROL 
OVER HIS DISORGANIZED FORCES.  IN A SEPARATE CON- 
VERSATION, TURKISH DCM OKCUN OBSERVED THAT THE 
KDP HAS \"FALLEN INTO SOME DISARRAY\" FOLLOWING IDRIS 
BARZANI\'S DEATH ONE YEAR AGO.  MASOUD HAD APPARENTLY 
EVEN GIVEN THE ORDER TO KILL PKK INSURGENTS, 
IN CONFORMITY WITH HIS \"UNDERSTANDING\" WITH A 
TURKISH GENERAL IN COMMAND IN EASTERN TURKEY TO 
\"SHUT OUT\" THE PKK, BUT MASOUD \"CANNOT DISCIPLINE HIS 
OWN PEOPLE.\" 
 
5.  OKCUN SAID THAT APO ACALAN (HEAD OF PKK, 
RESIDENT IN SYRIA) HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH JALAL 
TALABANI, HEAD OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION OF KURDISTAN 
(PUK), PRESUMABLY THROUGH SOME SYRIAN INTERMEDIATION 
AND IMPETUS.  TALABANI IS SEEKING GREATER STATUS AS 
\"THE PREEMINENT KURDISH LEADER\" AND THUS WANTS THE 
PKK AS AN ALLY, BUT ONLY IF THE PKK BEHAVES ITSELF. 
ACCORDING TO OKCUN, TALABANI ALSO IS LOOKING TOWARD 
A TIME WHEN THE PKK WILL BE HELPFUL TO HIM IN MOVING 
AGAINST BARZANI.  THE ELEMENTS OF THE TALABANI- 
ACALAN AGREEMENT SEEM TO BE: 
 
-- CESSATION, FOR THE TIME BEING, OF PKK ATTACKS 
ON CIVILIANS, 
 
-- CESSATION OF PKK ASSASSINATIONS OF OTHER KURDS, 
ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE, 
 
-- TURNING AGAINST THE KDP IN FULL FORCE, BUT NOT 
UNTIL \"THE TIME IS RIPE.\" 
 
OKCUN OBSERVED THAT IT IS ODD THAT THE PKK IS CULTI- 
VATING THE PUK, WHOSE TRADITIONAL AREA OF OPERATION 
IS AROUND SULAYMANIYYA AND NOT ALONG THE IRAQI- 
TURKISH BORDER WHICH IS KEY TO THE PKK, BUT HE ASSUMED 
THAT THE          IMPORTANT FACTORS ARE ANGER AT 
MASOUD\'S PRESSURE ON THE PKK AND MASOUD\'S INCREASING 
LACK OF CONTROL WHICH ALLOWS THE PKK TO USE BASES IN 
KDP TERRITORY DESPITE ENMITY WITH MASOUD.  OKCUN 
SAID THAT IN THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THERE HAS BEEN A 
MARKED DECREASE IN PKK ATTACKS, EVEN ON JANDARMA, AND 
HE GAVE CREDIT TO THE PUTATIVE ACALAN-TALABANI- 
SYRIAN AGREEMENT. 
 
6.  OKCUN ADDED THAT A NEW WORRISOME ELEMENT HAS EMERGED 
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS:  USE BY THE PKK OF NEW WEAPONRY 
OBTAINED FROM THE IRAQIS.  THE TURKS, OKCUN SAID, HAVE 
TO ASSUME THAT THESE WEAPONS HAVE NOT BEEN CAPTURED, SINCE 
THEY ARE IN SERIAL SEQUENCE AND NEW.  THE TURKS HAVE NOT 
RAISED THE ISSUE YET WITH THE IRAQIS, IN HOPES THAT IT 
WILL TURN OUT TO HAVE  BEEN A LIMITED ARRANGEMENT. 
(ASKED WHY THE IRAQIS WOULD RISK HARMING ITS KEY 
RELATIONAHIP WITH TURKEY--AFTER ALL, NEITHER STATE IS 
BLESSED WITH AN OVERABUNDANCE OF FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS-- 
OKCUN MUSED THAT \"ALL THESE COUNTRIES\"--SYRIA, IRAN, 
AND IRAQ--ARE ACCUSTOMED TO PUTTING ON PRESSURE THROUGH 
RUNDERHANDED, VIOLENT MEANS:  \"IT IS IN THEIR CHARACTER,\" 
WAS HIS VIEW.) 
 
7.  COMMENT:  THE HISTORY OF KURDS, AT LEAST IN IRAQI 
KURDISTAN, IS THAT PPWE THEY ARE ALWAYS READY TO FIGHT 
NON-KURDISH OUTSIDERS THEY ALSO FREQUENTLY FIGHT EACH 
OTHER.  THE CURRENT PKK-KDP SITUATION AND FREQUENT 
KDP-PUK FUEDS ILLUSTRATE THIS CONSTANT OF IRAQI KURDISH 
POLITICS.

E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR 
TAGS:  PREL IZ 
SUBJECT: THE REGIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM 
 
1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  IRAQI MORALE IS AT A LOW POINT, ALTHOUGH 
IRAQIS REMAIN AS WEARILY DETERMINED AS EVER NOT TO 
LOSE THE WAR.  SEVERAL RECENT GOVERNMENT ACTIONS -- 
RENEWED POPULAR ARMY RECRUITING, THE EX POST FACTO 
CANCELLATION OF AN AMNESTY FOR DESERTERS, AND THE 
BUNGLED EVACUATION EXERCISE -- ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THIS DIP.  EROSION OF LIVING STANDARDS THROUGH 
INFLATION REMAINS A SERIOUS LONG TERM PROBLEM.  THE 
RECENT MISSILE EXCHANGE HAS ADDED TO CIVILIAN FEARS. 
IT HAS ALSO GIVEN A BOOST TO THE MORALE OF SOME TO 
SEE IRAQ ABLE TO STRIKE BACK AT TEHRAN, BUT THIS 
POSITIVE EFFECT WILL DISSIPATE IF THE EXCHANGE 
CONTINUES VERY LONG.  OFFICIAL BRAVADO IS A RESULT 
OF LOCAL MACHISMO AND A DESIRE TO BOOST SAGGING 
HOME-FRONT MORALE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN THE OPINION OF THE AMBASSADOR, CIVILIAN MORALE 
IN BAGHDAD IS CURRENTLY LOWER THAN AT ANY TIME DURING 
HIS THIRTY-NINE MONTHS AT POST.  WHILE THE QUESTION 
MAY NOT BE CRITICAL FOR IRAQ, SINCE IRAQIS SOMEHOW 
DO AND MUST KEEP ON WITH THEIR DAILY LIVES IN THE 
FACE OF OFFICIAL COMPULSION AND POSSESS A GENUINE 
IF WEARY DETERMINATION NOT TO BE DEFEATED BY A 
DESPISED IRANIAN REGIME, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BURDEN 
IS MORE ANGUISHING NOW THAN IN RECENT MEMORY. 
 
4.  UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE IRAQIS, MUCH OF THE ADDED 
BURDEN ON MORALE IS DUE DECISIONS AND MISCALCULATIONS 
BY THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT IN RECENT MONTHS, INCLUDING: 
 
-- 1) A MAJOR REAPPEARANCE OF POPULAR ARMY PRESS GANGS 
AFTER AN ABSENCE OF A YEAR.  ONE EXPLANATION IS THAT THE 
REGIME IS RAISING UNITS TO REPLACE KURDISH TRIBAL 
IRREGULAR UNITS DOING GARRISON AND REAR-AREA PATROL DUTY, 
SINCE THESE UNITS ARE CONSIDERED EVEN LESS RELIABLE 
IN THE WAKE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION 
OF KURDISH VILLAGES.  (THE STREET RUMOR IS THAT 
THREE-FOURTHS OF THE NEW PA FORCES WILL GO NORTH TO 
KURDISTAN;ONE FOURTH TO GUARD PIPELINE.)  MIDDLE-AGED 
BAGHDADIS REALLY FEAR DUTY IN KURDISTAN, EXPECTING 
TO HAVE THEIR THROATS CUT IN THE DARK OF NIGHT. 
ANOTHER EXPLANATION IS THAT AFTER A YEAR OF RECRUITING 
INACTIVITY, MANY PA UNITS ARE DUE TO BE DEMOBILIZED 
AFTER THEIR FOURTEEN MONTHS DUTY PERIOD AND MUST NOW 
BE REPLACED WHOLESALE. 
 
-- 2) THE EX POST FACTO CANCELLATION BY SADDAM OF THE 
LAST AMNESTY DECLARED IN JANUARY.  MANY IRAQIS 
ACCUSE THE REGIME OF LURING DESERTERS IN TO SENTENCE 
THEM TO PRISON AND SOME TO EXECUTION.  THIS PERCEIVED 
DOUBLE-DEALING HAS HARMED THE REGIME\'S ALREADY POOR 
CREDIBILITY WITH ITS OWN PEOPLE. 
 
-- 3) THE BUNGLED EVACUATION EXERCISE CANCELLED IN 
LATE FEBRUARY.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S CHARACTERISTIC 
FAILURE TO EXPLAIN ITSELF AND THE POPULATION\'S USUAL 
PENCHANT FOR WILD RUMORS IN THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF 
RELIABLE INFORMATION SOWED REAL PANIC, WITH RUMORS OF 
IMPENDING NUCLEAR ATTACK, CHEMICAL WARFARE, AND FLOODING 
DUE TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE SADDAM TIGRIS DAM NEAR 
MOSUL. 
 
5.  A LONGER TERM SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR IRAQIS REMALNS 
THE STEADY EROSION OF THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING 
THROUGH STEADY INFLATION IN THE FACE OF A NINE-YEAR 
GOVERNMENT WAGE FREEZE AND THE DRAFTING ONE AFTER 
ANOTHER OF WORKING MALE FAMILY MEMBERS.  A HIGH 
GOVERNMENT MONTHLY SALARY OF 250 DINARS (800 DOLLARS 
AT THE OFFICIAL RATE, 125 AT THE BLACK MARKET AND 
REAL VALUE RATE) BUYS LITTLE WHEN MEAT ON THE BONE 
COSTS NINE DINARS A KILO AND A KILO OF FRUITS OR 
VEGETABLES TWO TO THREE DINARS. 
 
6.  ONE NOTICEABLE RESULT OF THESE CURRENT PRESSURES 
HAS BEEN THE GROWING NUMBER OF BAGHDADIS MOVING THEIR 
FAMILIES OUT OF THE CITY OR MAKING ALTERNATIVE 
EMERGENCY ACCOMMODATIONS ARRANGEMENTS ELSEWHERE. 
THE EVACUATION EXERCISE AND THE LATEST MISSILE EXCHANGE 
WITH IRAN HAVE ACCELERATED THIS TREND.  (THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S NEAREST NEIGHBOR, ONE OF IRAQ\'S RICHEST 
BUSINESSMEN, HAS DECAMPED TO MOSUL AND POORER PEOPLE 
ARE TRYING TO MOVE IN WITH RELATIVES ELSEWHERE.)  WE DO 
NOT EXPECT ANY WHOLESALE FLIGHT, BUT TRAFFIC IN BADHDAD 
IS CURRENTLY NOTICEABLY LIGHTER THAN USUAL. 
 
7.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT THE LONGER-TERM EFFECT 
OF THE MISSILE EXCHANGE WILL BE.  FOR MANY, IF NOT 
MOST, IT HAS MEANT FEAR.  OTHERS ARE PLEASED TO SEE 
IRAQ AT LAST ABLE TO RESPOND IN KIND AND IN FORCE TO 
PREVIOUS IRANIAN SCUD ATTACKS ON BAGHDAD AND HOPE IT 
WILL FRIGHTEN IRAN FROM FURTHER ATTACKS.  IF, AS WE 
WOULD EXPECT, IRAN RESPONDS INSTEAD WITH MORE SCUDS, 
THESE LATTER PEOPLE WILL LIKELY LOSE THIS OPTIMISTIC 
INTERPRETATION.  FINALLY SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, 
INCLUDING A NORMALLY PACIFIC MFA SOURCE, ARGUE THAT 
IRAQ SHOULD ENCOURAGE A MAJOR IRANIAN ATTACK SINCE THE 
IRAQI ARMY HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER, ITS MORALE BETTER, 
WHILE THE IRANIANS ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY MOBILIZING. 
WE PUT THIS VIEW DOWN TO OFFICIAL BRAVADO ARISING OUT 
OF A RESURGENCE OF IRAQI MACHISMO AND A DESIRE TO 
COMBAT SAGGING HOME-FRONT MORALE.

PRESSURE IRAQ TO DE-ESCALATE 
 
1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
2.  NOW THAT THE WAR OF THE CITIES HAS RESUMED 
(REGARDLESS OF WHO ACTUALLY STARTED IT), THE IRAQIS 
APPEAR TO FEEL THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1980-81 
THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE OVER 
IRAN.  ALTHOUGH UNDERSECRETARY HAMDOON ARGUED TO ME 
YESTERDAY THAT IRAQ WANTS TO ASSURE MUTUAL DETERRENCE 
AGAINST HITTING THE TWO CAPITALS, THE IRAQIS ARE 
SHOWING NONE OF THE MEASURED RESPONSE SUCH A GOAL 
WOULD IMPLY.  RATHER THEY HAVE FIRED NINETEEN 
MISSILES TO DATE, NAMED BY THEM PROVOCATIVELY THE 
\"HUSSEIN\" AFTER SHIA ISLAM\'S MOST HOLY FIGURE, AND, 
EVEN MORE PROVOCATIVELY, HAVE FIRED THE LATEST ONE 
AGAINST THE HOLY CITY OF QUM. 
 
3.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE IRAQIS SEE THIS STRATEGIC 
ADVANTAGE AND ARE PRESSING IT HOME.  IF THEY HAVE 
STOCKPILED A LARGE SUPPLY OF MISSILES (WE ASSUME 
BUT DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE SOVIET SS-12\'S), THEY 
HAVE BADLY OUTGUNNED THE IRANIANS WHO HAVE ONLY A 
LIMITED SUPPLY OF OBSOLETE, SLOW-RELOADING SCUD B\'S 
WITH A FEW LAUNCHERS.  THE IRAQIS ALSO KNOW THAT THEY 
HAVE AN ADVANTAGE ON THE GROUND.  IRAN IS NOT READY 
FOR AN ALL-OUT OFFENSIVE IN THE SOUTH.  IF IT IS 
GOADED TO ATTACK WITH WHAT THEY HAVE, THEY FACE 
ALMOST CERTAIN DEFEAT AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
STRONG COUNTER-ATTACK FROM IRAQ.  THE WINDOW FOR 
ATTACKING IS RAPIDLY RUNNING OUT FOR IRAN, SINCE THE 
PRIME WINTER IAPYJV  S PQMF AILL BE OVER BY THE 
END OF THIS MONTH, HARDLY ENOUGH TIME EVEN IF A NEW 
RECRUITING OF BASIJ STIMULATED BY THE MISSILE ATTACKS 
BEGINS IMMEDIATELY. 
 
4.  THE IRAQ MOTIVE IN FORCING AN ESCALATION OF 
THE FIGHTING IS CLEARLY TO MAKE IRAN GIVE UP ITS 
WAR AIMS.  FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE INITIAL AIR 
RAIDS ON KHARG ISLAND THREE YEARS AGO, IRAQ SENSES 
THAT IT REALLY HAS THE ABILITY TO FORCE AN END TO 
HOSTILITIES, RATHER THAN JUST TO REACT.  UNDER THESE 
CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS NOT LIKELY TO LISTEN TO APPEALS 
TO EASE OFF. 
 
5.  OUR CONDEMNATION OF BOTH SIDES FOR ATTACKING 
CIVILIAN TARGETS WAS JUST RIGHT.  I BELIEVE THAT, IF 
THE ATTACKS GO ON ANOTHER DAY, WE SHOULD GO BEYOND 
THE CONDEMNATION AND PRASS IRWY TT BE-ESCALATE.  I 
AM NOT SANGUINE THAT THEY WILL LISTEN, SINCE THEY 
SEE A VITAL OPPORTUNITY AND THEIR RECORD FOR LISTENING 
TO OUR UNWELCOME ADVICE IS NOT ENCOURAGING.  BUT IN 
THE INTEREST OF OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A QUICK 
PEACEFUL END TO THIS CONFLICT AND ABOVE ALL TO 
AVOID THE DANGERS OF AN INTENSIFIED WAR, I BELIEVE 
WE SHOULD MAKE THE EFFORT.

2.  MFA SENIOR UNDERSECRETARY ZIHAWI CALLED IN 
AMBASSADORS OF FIVE PERMANENT MEMBERS AT 1330 
MARCH 10 TO ANNOUNCE IRAQ LEADERSHIP\'S DECISION TO 
HALT ATTACKS ON IRANIAN CITIES.  A PUBLIC ANNOUNCE- 
MENT IS TO BE MADE SHORTLY, PROBABLY ON THE 1430 
LOCAL NEWS.  ZIHAWI CONCEDED THAT IF IRAN DID NOT 
STOP, IRAQ WOULD BE FORCED TO RESUME. 
 
3.  ZIHAWI SAID THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE SOME 
TIME AGO (NOTE: PRESUMABLY A REFERENCE TO TOP LEVEL RE- 
VIEW UNDERSECRETARY HAMDOON SAID WAS BEING CONDUCTED 
SEVERAL DAYS AGO).  IT WAS NOT, ZIHAWI UNDERLINED, 
IN RESPONSE TO THE INITIATIVE OF ANY OUTSIDE PARTY. 
 
4.  ZIHAWI CONCLUDED BY EMPHASIZING RESPONSIBILITY 
OF THE FIVE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY BY PASSING AN 
ARMS ENFORCEMENT AGAINST IRAN IN THE FORM OF AN 
ARMS EMBARGO. 
 
5.  ON THE WAY OUT THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR ASKED THE 
AMBASSADOR WHY IRAQ WAS STOPPED.  THE AMBASSADOR 
RESPONDED THAT PERHAPS THE SOVIET UNCON SHOULD GET 
SOME CREDIT SINCE IT HAS PROPOSED SUCH AN UNWELCOME 
RESOLUTION IN NEW YORK. 
 
6.  COMMENT: IRAQ IS ENDING WITH A FLOURISH SINCE IT 
CLAIMS TO HAVE FIRED FOUR MISSILES IN THE LAST 24 
HOURS (1800, 2250, 0534, AND 1230).  THE LAST 
IRANIAN MISSILE WAS 0941 MARCH 9.

IT DOES NOT VIEW AS BEING A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

SUBJ:  IRAQI OPERATION TO RECAPTURE FAO:\"WE SHOWED 
THE SOVIETS\" 
 
1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
2.  IN A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR MAY 19, MFA 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DIRECTOR QAYSI DISCUSSED 
THE BRIEFING ON FAO GIVEN BY FONMIN AZIZ TO HIS 
SENIOR STAFF THAT MORNING. 
 
3.  AZIZ TOLD HIS PEOPLE THAT THE DECISION TO 
RETAKE FAO WAS MADE LAST FALL UNDER ELABORATE 
SECRECY WHEN THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP CONCLUDED THAT 
THE 598 PROCESS WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE UNLESS IRAQ 
GAVE IT A PUSH BY GAINING SOME MILITARY VICTORY. 
(THE DECISION TO PRESS AHEAD WITH STOCKPILING 
\"HUSSEIN\" MISSILES FOR MASSIVE USE WAS PROBABLY 
RELATED.).  IRAQ THEN ENGAGED IN A CAREFUL DECEPTION 
OPERATION, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CREATED A FULL- 
SCALE MODEL OF THE FAO SALT PANS FOR DETAILED 
PRACTICE OPERATIONS BY ITS UNITS.  WHEN THE TIME 
FOR THE OPERATION WAS NEAR, SADDAM, MINDEF 
KHAIRALLAH AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF MADE A WELL- 
PUBLISIZED VISITTO THE NORTH, BUT THEN SECRETLY 
JETTED IMMEDIATELY TO BASRA.  PREVIOUSLY SOME 
UNNEEDED ARMY UNITS IN THE SOUTH (WE RECALL REPORT- 
ING ON A FULL DIVISION) WERE MOVED NORTH IN DAYLIGHT 
TO DECEIVE THE IRANIANS FURTHER. 
 
4.  IRAQI TROOPS JUMPED OFF AT 0625 MAY 17 ACCORDING 
TO AZIZ, AFTER DAWN WHEN IRANIAN UNITS WOULD HAVE 
BEGUN TO RELAX.  (AN ORDER TO LAUNCH THE ATTACK AT 
2200 THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WAS PART OF THE DECEPTION). 
IRAQI UNITS ACHIEVED COMPLETE SURPRISE AND PENE- 
TRATED THE ENTIRE IRANIAN DEFENSES IN THE SALT PANS 
IN A GUDERIAN-STYLE OPERATION, LEAVING IT TO 
FOLLOWING UNITS TO MOP UP RESISTANCE WHILE THE TWO 
PINCERS OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD AND THE SEVENTH 
CORPS JOINED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OBSTACLE. 
IRAQI UNITS THEN ENTERED FAO THE MORNING OF MAY 18. 
AZIZ SAID THAT IRAQI CASUALTIES HAD BEEN MORE THAN 
REASONABLE FOR SUCH AN OPERATION AND CONSIDERABLY 
LESS THAN PLANNERS HAD ANTICIPATED.  AZIZ DID NOT 
GIVE  ANY IRANIAN CASUALTY FIGURES OR COMMENT HOW 
MANY MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED. 
 
5.  QAYSI SAID THAT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE 
ELATED BY THE NEWS WHICH HE AGREED WAS IRAQ\'S 
GREATEST MILITARY SUCCESS SINCE 1980-81.  HE RECALLED 
A MEETING HE ATTENDED OF AZIZ WITH SHEVARDNADZE IN 
THE SUMMER OF 1986 IN MOSCOW AFTER THE FAO DEBACLE 
WHEN  THE SOVIET, TREATING AZIZ HUMILIATINGLY LIKE 
THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A DEFEATED NATION, URGED HIM 
TO AGREE TO HALT THE WAR ON THE BASIS OF A 
CEASEFIRE IN PLACE.  AZIZ TOLD SHEVARDNADZE THAT 
IRAQ WOULD NEVER SETTLE FOR LESS THAN A COMPREHENSIVE 
PEACE WITH FULL WITHDRAWAL AND AN EXCHANGE OF 
PRISONERS, BUT THE SOVIET FONMIN OBVIOUSLY DISMISSED 
THIS POSITION AS PURE PROPAGANDA.  NOW IRAQ WAS 
VINDICATED, QAYSI SAID WITH PRIDE, AND HAD SHOWN 
THAT IT ALWAYS MEANT WHAT IT SAID. 
 
6.  IN A FINAL PURELY PERSONAL COMMENT, QAYSI 
GUESSED THAT IRAQ, FLUSHED WITH SUCCESS, MIGHT NOT BE 
FINISHED HITTING THE IRANIANS.  HE WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED, HE SAID, TO SEE A SIMILAR OPERATION IN 
THE FUTURE EAST OF BASRA.  THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED 
THAT SUCH AN OPERATION STRAIGHT TOWARDS IRAN COULD 
BE EVEN TOUGHER THAN FAO.

TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, KPAL, IZ 
SUBJECT:  IRAQ KEEPS THREATENING TO SEND MISSILES 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  EVERY DAY THE IRAQIS TURN OUT MILITARY 
COMMUNIQUES THREATENING \"SEVERE PUNISHMENT\" AGAINST 
IRAN FOR CONTINUING TO SHELL IRAQI BORDER TOWNS (TYPI- 
CALLY ONLY DARBANDIKHAN, WHICH TODAY SCARCELY FITS THE 
DEFINITION OFIA CIVILIAN TARGET).  WITH NEARLY THREE 
WEEKS ELAPSING SINCE THE END OF THE MISSILE WAR, IT 
SEEMS MORE AND MORE LIKELY THAT THE IRAQIS INTEND TO 
DO NO MORE THAN KEEP THE IRANIANS AWARE THAT THEIR 
\"FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER\" SHOULD THE IRANIANS TRY 
ANYTHING BIG, ALTHOUGH THE VALUE OF THE IRAQI WARNINGS 
IS GROWING INCREASINGLY HOLLOW.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THERE HAS BEEN NO RELENTING YET IN THE STRIDENCY 
OF IRAQI WARNINGS THAT IF THE IRANIANS DO NOT DESIST 
IN SHELLING BORDER CITIES AND \"VIOLATING THE CONDI- 
IONS STIPULATED FOR THE HALT OF IRANIAN CITIES,\" 
IRAQ WILL METE OUT \"SEVERE PUNISHMENT\" (CLEAR REFER- 
ENCE TO RESUMPTION OF USE OF MISSILES).  THE ODD THING 
LS THAT IN THE PAST WEEK THE IRAQI MEDIA HAVE MENTION- 
ED ONLY TWO SUCH \"BORDER CITIES\"--DARBANDIKHAN (NEAR 
HALABJA) EVERY DY, AND ON ONE OCCASION ABUL-KHASIB 
(NEAR BASRA).  BOTH ARE ABANDONED AND BOTH SIT 
ASTRIDE IMPORTANT HIGHWAYS CLOSE TO IRANIAN LINES 
THAT ARE OBVIOUS TARGETS FOR IRANIAN ARTILLERY. 
(INDEED, IT IS ESSENTIAL FROM A MILITARY STANDPOINT 
FOR IRAN TO TRY TO INTERDICT MOVEMENT ALONG BOTH 
HIGHWAYS.) 
 
4.  FOR THEIR PART, THE IRAQIS STRUCK THE SHIRAZ 
REFINERY AND PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX ON MAY 4.  THE 
SUBSEQUENT MILITARY COMMUNIQUE MADE IT CLEAR THAT 
THEY INTEND TO CONTINUE HITTING SUCH ECONOMIC TARGETS 
FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR. 
 
5.  OF PARTICULAR NOTE, AS WE OBSERVE FROM FBIS 
REPORTAGE OF IRANIAN BROADCASTS, IS THE FERVOR WITH 
WHICH THE IRANIANS DENY STRIKING ANY CIVILIAN 
TARGETS IN IRAQ--INCLUDING DENYING ANY SHELLING 
OF DARBANDIKHAN.  OUR AUSTRALIAN COLLEAGUES TELL US 
THAT TEHRAN IS JUST BEGINNING TO COME BACK TO LIFE 
FULLY.  THEIR EMBASSY IN TEHRAN ASSESSES THAT THE 
IRANIANS ARE EXTREMELY KEEN TO PREVENT A RESUMPTION 
OF THE MISSILE EXCHANGE--UNTIL, THAT IS, IRAN FEELS 
ON A TECHNOLOGICAL PAR WITH IRAQ AND CAN DELIVER 
JUST AS STRONG BLOWS AGAINST BAGHDAD AS THE IRAQIS 
CAN AGAINST TEHRAN.  FOR THEIR PART, THE IRAQIS 
HAVE ALSO BEEN KEEN TO DENY IRANIAN CLAIMS OF 
IRAQI STRIKES ON IRANIAN BORDER AREAS. 
 
6.  MEANWHILE, IRAQ CONTINUES OFFICIALLY TO BUBBLE 
OVER WITH PLEASURE AT THE VICTORY AT FAO AND THE 
MIGHTINESS OF THE HUSSEIN MISSILE, NOW FOLLOWED BY 
THE ABBAS MISSILE OF A CLAIMED EVEN LONGER STRIKING 
POWER.  SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS MADE NO FEWER THAN FOUR 
VISITS TO AN EXHIBITION OF THE MILITARY INDUSTRY 
COMMISSION, AND ON MAY 5 HE BESTOWED ON THE COMMIS- 
SION\'S DIRECTOR--HIS SON-IN-LAW AND COUSIN HUSAYN 
KAMIL (JUST PROMOTED FROM COLONEL TO BRIGADIER)-- 
AND SEVERAL OF ITS STAFF \"RAFIDAIN MEDALS FOR 
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE.\"  IN VIRTUALLY EVERY HIGH- 
LEVEL MILITARY MEETING SADDAM NOW HAS, HUSAYN KAMIL 
IS PHOTOGRAPHED AT HIS SIDE, ALONG WITH HIS BROTHER- 
IN-LAW AND COUSIN DEFENSE MINISTER ADNAN KHAYRALLAH. 
THE BIG NEWS IN THE PRESS MAY 8 WAS THE OFFICIAL 
DELIVERY BY PARTY NUMBER-TWO IZZAT IBRAHIM TO SADDAM 
OF HIS LATEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT, A MINIATURE OF THE 
HUSSEIN MISSILE FROM THE PEOPLE OF SALAH AL DIN 
(TIKRIT) PROVINCE.  THE BIG NEWS ON MAY 9 WAS 
SADDAM\'S PRESIDING OVER DISCUSSION OF FINAL DESIGNS 
FOR A MONUMENT TO BE ERECTED AT THE BILAT AL-SHUHADA 
SCHOOL, DESTROYED BY AN IRANIAN MISSILE OCTOBER 13, 
AND HIS REVIEWING A HALL FULL OF BIRTHDAY PRESENTS 
\"GIVEN TO HIM BY THE IRAQI PEOPLE SHOWING THEIR JOY.\" 
 
7.  SADDAM\'S MAY 1 INTERVIEW WITH AN EGYPTIAN 
JOURNALIST SANA AL-SA\'ID, WAS FINALLY PUBLISHED MAY 6 
(SEE FBIS JNO70944).  SADDAM TYPICALLY PREFERS ARAB 
TO NON-ARAB JOURNALISTS, PARTLY OUT OF NATIONALISM 
AND PARTLY BECAUSE THEY TEND TO ASK LESS DELICATE 
QUESTIONS.  SANA AL-SA\'ID DID TRY A FEW INTERESTING 
QUESTIONS, BUT SADDAM DOGGEDLY DODGED THEM.  SHE 
TRIED TO GET HIM TO SAY SOMETHING PROVOCATIVE ABOUT 
HOW FAO IS A HARBINGER OF ARAB VICTORY OVER JERUSALEM, 
BUT HE MEALY-MOUTHED ABOUT LACK OF ARAB UNITY AND 
PROBLEMS WITH WORLD OPINION.  SHE TRIED TO GET HIM 
TO CASTIGATE OMAN, QATAR, AND THE EMIRATES, BUT HE 
DID NOT BITE.  SHE INSINUATED SUPERPOWER UNHELP- 
FULNESS, BUT THERE WERE NO WORDS OF CRITICISM 
FOR THE SOVIET UNION, AND HE EXCUSED U.S. NAVAL 
PRESENCE IN THE GULF AS BEING LONGSTANDING AND, 
IN ANY CASE, SOMETHING FOR WHICH IRAN IS ENTIRELY 
TO BLAME.  HE REFUSED TO BLAME THE PLO FOR RAP- 
PROCHEMENT WITH SYRIA.  HE LIED EFFUSIVELY ABOUT 
HOW THE IRAQIS NOW RELY ON THEMSELVES FOR MOST 
WEAPONS, INCLUDING THE HUSSEIN MISSILE, ALTHOUGH 
HE DID CONTRADICTORILY ADMIT THAT \"PURCHASES OF 
SOVIET ARMS ARE STILL BIG.\" 
 
8.  ARAFAT, WHO ARRIVED IN BAGHDAD FROM DAMASCUS ON 
APRIL 26, IS STILL IN TOWN, GETTING PUBLICITY FOR 
HIS PROMINENCE IN SADDAM\'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS AND 
IN MEETINGS WITH SADDAM ON APRIL 27 AND MAY 7.  BE- 
TWEEN THESE DATES THERE WERE MEETINGS OF THE PLO 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND THE HIGHER COMMITTEE FOR 
OCCUPIED LAND AFFAIRS.  PLO STATEMENTS AS PUBLISHED 
IN THE BAGHPAD PRESS ARE MAINLY DEVOTED TO PRAISE OF 
THE VICTORY AT FAO \"LEADING TO VICTORY IN JERUSALEM.\" 
 
9.  SAUDI ARABIA\'S RUPTURE OF RELATIONS WITH IRAN 
HAS BEEN A MAJOR SOURCE OF PRAISE AMONG EDITORIALISTS, 
WITH A STRONG UNDERCURRENT THEME THAT OTHER ARAB 
STATES MUST FOLLOW SUIT.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER TAHA 
YASIN RAMADAN, CARRYING SADDAM\'S LETTER OF PRAISE 
FOR SAUDI ARABIA\'S TOUGH STAND AGAINST IRAN, MET 
KING FAHD IN RIYADH MAY 6 AND MADE HIS SECOND UMRA 
TO MECCA IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS. 
 
10.  COMMENT:  IN THE SHORT TERM, THERE IS HOPE FOR 
A CONTINUED LULL IN THE MISSILE WAR.  WHILE THE 
IRAQIS GREATLY RELISHED THE DISRUPTION IN TEHRAN, 
THEY ARE RESTRAINED BY COUNTERVAILING FACTORS. 
BAGHDAD WAS ALSO DISRUPTED, EVEN IF TO A MUCH RE- 
DUCED DEGREE THAN TEHRAN; BAGHDADIS WERE BEGINNING 
TO BE VERY MUCH ON EDGE.  THE IRAQIS MAY HAVE 
WORRIED ABOUT SUPPLY PROBLEMS; NO MATTER WHICH 
REPORT ONE BELIEVES, IRAQ\'S SUPPLY OF MISSILES IS 
NOT LIMITLESS.  PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT, THE 
IRAQIS MAY HAVE--OR SHOULD HAVE, BY ANY LOGIC-- 
CALCULATED THAT MISSILES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AS A 
DETERRENT IF NOT OVERUSED.  NOW THE IRANIANS 
PAINFULLY KNOW WHAT THE IRAQIS CAN DO, AND TEHRAN 
IS BEING REPOPULATED; HENCEFORTH, THE IRANIANS 
WILL HAVE TO CALCULATE CAREFULLY ABOUT THEIR 
ATTACKS ON THE GROUND OR WITH MISSILES. 
 
11.  IN THE LONGER RUN, THE PICTURE MAY NOT BE 
SO HOPEFUL.  WE ARE IN A REGIONAL ARMS RACE, AND 
IF THE IRANIANS ARE ABLE TO CATCH UP, A DEADLIER 
MISSILE WAR MAY ULTIMATELY BE IN THE OFFING. IN 
THIS RACE, THE IRANIANS HAVE A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE 
OVER THE IRAQIS, NAMELY,  THAT BAGHDAD AND OTHER 
IRAQI POPULATION CENTERS LIE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES 
NEARER THE BORDER THAN DO MOST IRANIAN CITIES. 
THE IRANIANS THEREFORE ONLY NEED SMALLER MISSILES 
WHICH MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SPEEDIER PRODUCTION 
IN GREATER QUANTITY, OR IN THE CASE OF MISSILES OF 
SIMILAR SIZE AND PROPELLENT, THEY ARE ABLE TO 
PACK IN MUCH MORE EXPLOSIVES.  EITHER PROSPECT 
SHOULD GIVE THE IRAQIS PAUSE, AS THEY CONGRATULATE 
THEMSELVES ON THEIR NEW MISSILES.

REF: FBIS JN1808064588 (#) 
 
 
1. SUMMARY: WE ARE SOMEWHAT PUZZLED BY IRAQ NEWS 
AGENCY COMMENTARY, ALMOST CERTAINLY COMING DIRECTLY 
FROM THE PRESIDENCY, ACCUSING \"IMPERIALIST POWERS\" 
(I.E., UNITED STATES MOST OF ALL) OF PRESSING IRAN 
TO ACCEPT UNSCR 598 IN ORDER TO PREVENT KHOMEINI\'S 
COLLAPSE.  WE INTERPRET THIS BLUSTER AS SADDAM\'S 
BULLYING WAY OF SAYING WHAT IS PATENTLY TRUE, THAT 
THE UPCOMING PERIOD WILL BE A TEST OF IRAQ\'S RELA- 
TION WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER EXTERNAL POWERS. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. BAGHDAD TELEVISION, RADIO, AND ALL NEWSPAPERS 
AUGUST 18 PROMINENTLY CARRIED A VEHEMENT BUT MORE 
THAN USUALLY INARTICULATE EDITORIAL (REF FBIS), 
ATTRIBUTED TO THE POLITICAL EDITOR OF THE IRAQ NEWS 
AGENCY, SHARPLY WARNING WORLD POWERS AGAINST GIVING 
SUPPORT TO IRAN DURING THE CEASE-FIRE PERIOD.  FROM 
ITS PROMINENCE, IT UNDOUBTEDLY EMANATED FROM THE 
PRESIDENCY ITSELF.  THE COMMENTARY WARNED THAT \"SOME 
IMPERIALIST POWERS\" (UNSPECIFIED BUT CLEARLY INCLUDING 
THE UNITED STATES) WANT TO KEEP ARAB COUNTRIES 
OCCUPIED IN DISPUTES WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS (I.E., 
IRAN) IN ORDER TO PROTECT ISRAEL.  IT CLAIMED CERTAIN 
POWERS HAD PRESSED IRAN TO ACCEPT RESOLUTION 598 
IN ORDER TO PREVENT KHOMEINI\'S COLLAPSE. 
 
3. COMMENT: WHILE WE KNOW THE IRAQIS FEAR THAT THE 
U.S. WILL RESUME A PRO-IRANIAN POLICY TO THE DETRIMENT 
OF IRAQI INTERESTS, THE PROMINENCE AND TIMING OF THE 
EDITORIAL ARE CURIOUS.  WE HAVE REASSURAD THE IRAWI 
AZ A HIGH GEVEL AND THROUGH DIFFERENT CHANNELS THAT 
WE DO NOT CONTEMPLATE \"TILTING\" IN EITHER DIRECTION. 
 
4. WE CONCLUDE THAT THIS FORM OF INARTICULATE LASHING 
OUT SERVES MORE THAN ANYTHING TO DEMONSTRATE IRAQ\'S 
SENSE OF INSECURITY.  A NEW ERA IS EMERGING, AND IRAQ 
IS NERVOUS ABOUT THE DEVELOPING ATTITUDES OF EXTERNAL 
POWERS.  SADDAM\'S INSTINCTIVE REACTION IS TO WARN 
WITH BLUSTERING, UNSPECIFIC THREATS.  TARIQ AZIZ 
AND THE MFA DIPLOMATSSTRESS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
SAME COIN, I.E., THEIR HOPE AND DESIRE THAT THE 
POST-WAR PERIOD WILL WITNESS BROADER AND CLOSER 
COOPERATION WITH THE USG THROUGHOUT THE REGION.

SUBJECT: IRAN-IRAQ: EVE OF GENEVA 
 
REF: (A) BAGHDAD 4454  (B) STATE 270576 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEST. 
 
2. SUMMARY: THE IRAQIS GO TO GENEVA HAVING CONCEDED 
TO IRAN WHAT IT WANTED MOST, I.E., A CEASE-FIRE, 
AND THEY ARE, WE SUSPECT, DUBIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY 
THINK OHEZ CAN GET OUT OF THE TALKS.  THEY WANT 
ASSURANCE OF FREE NAVIGATION (INCLUDING WARSHIPS) 
WITHOUT INSPECTION BY IRAN; NO REPARATIONS TO IRAN; 
NO VERDICT BY THE IMPARTIAL COMMITTEE ACCUSING IRAQ; 
CLEAR DEMARCATION OF LAND BORDERS; AND ULTIMATELY, 
A PEACE TREATY WHICH GUARANTEES THE MOST IMPORTANT 
OBJECTIVE OF ALL, . NONINTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS (INCLUDING WITHDRAWAL OF SUPPORT OF KURDS). 
THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THE IRAQIS PROBABLY DO NOT 
BELIEVE THAT A CLERICAL REGIME, EVEN AFTER KHOMEINI 
DIES, CAN BE ANYTHING BUT EXPANSIONIST/REVOLUTIONARY, 
SO THAT NO PEACE TREATY WOULD BE WORTH MUCH IN THE 
LONG RUN. END SUMMARY. 
 
3. THE IRAQIS GO TO GENEVA IN A QUANDARY.  THEY HAVE 
ALREADY CONCEDED TO IRAN THE MAIN THING IRAN WANTED 
RIGHT NOW, I.E.,  CEASE-FIRE -- A BREATHING SPACE 
JUST WHEN IRAQ HAD TURNED THE TABLES MILITARILY. 
THEY MADE THIS CONCESSION PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF 
NEARLH UNAH 
YUNCOLDS OVER IRAN IS MILITARY 
THREAT, AND THE REPUBLICAN GUARD CONTINUES TO BE 
MASSED OPPOSITE ABADAN AS A POTENT WARNING TO IRAN. 
BUT THE JUBILANT CELEBRATIONS ALL OVER IRAQ MAKE IT 
MORE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT THREAT. 
 
4. THE PRINCIPAL DETERMINANT OF WHETHER THE IRAQIS 
WILL BE FORTHCOMING OR OBSTRUCTIONIST AT GENEVA IS 
THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE KEY ISSUE: IS IRAN REALLY 
INERESTED IN COMPJEHENSIVE PEACE?  WE BELIEVE THAT 
THE IRAQIS THEMSELVES DO WANT A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE. 
FOR ALL THEIR PRESENT MILITARY ADVANTAGE, WE DOUBT 
THAT THEY ENTERTAIN NOTIONS OF MILITARY CONQUEST 
OF IRAN.  THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH 
IRAN AND THAT IN TIME THE TABLES MAY TURN BACK THE 
OTHER WAY AGAIN, WITH IRAN RESURGING IN STRENGTH 
MILITARILY AND ECONOMICALLY.  ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE 
GAINED THE UPPER HAND WITH THE KURDS, THEY BADLY 
NEED A GUARANTEE OF NONSUPPORT OF THE KURDS FROM 
IRAN.  BUT FOR ALL THEIR YEARNING FOR A GENUINE 
PEACE, WE DOUBT LHAHTHE IRAQIS ARE NAIVE ENOUGH 
TO BELIEVE THAT ANY CLERICAL REGIME IN IRAN, EVEN 
AFTER KHOMEINI DIES, WILL RENOUNCE THE REVOLUTION 
OR ITS INTEGRAL ELEMENTS, EXPANSIONISM AND INTER- 
FERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, 
PRINCIPALLY IRAQ\'S. 
 
5. IF THIS ASSESSMENT IS CORRECT, WE PREDICT THAT 
EVEN THOUGH TARIQ AZIZ EMPHATICALLY WANTS TO AVOID 
A LONG PERIOD OF \"NO PEACE, NO WAR\" (ALONG THE LINES 
OF THE POST-1948 ARAB-ISRAEL DISPUTE), THE IRAQIS 
WILL NOT BE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO BE FORTHCOMING 
IN THE GENEVA TALKS, SINCE A PEACE TREATY WOULD 
NOT IMPEL THE IRANIANS TO SCALE DOWN THEIR LONG- 
TERM REVOLUTIONARY AMBITIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, 
THERE ARE A SERIES BF ULTIMATE GAINS THE IRAQIS 
MIGHT AIM FOR, INCLUDING: 
 
-- ASSURANCE OF FREE NAVIGATION IN THE GULF/HORMUZ/ 
SHATT, INCLUDING FOR WARSHIPS WITHOUT INSPECTION 
OR HINDRANCE BY IRAN.  THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS POINT 
WAS ALREADY MADE CLEAR TWO DAYS AFTER IRAN\'S 
ACCEPTANCE OF 598 IN TARIQ AZIZ\'S JULY 20 LETTER, 
OVER HALF OF WHICH WAS DEVOTED TO THE ISSUE OF 
NAVIGATION.  THE IRAQIS EMPHASIZE IT NOT ONLY 
BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM IN ITS OWN RIGHT, 
BUT BECAUSE THEY VIEW IT AS A TEST OF IRANIAN 
INTENTIONS.  AT A BASER LEVEL, THEY MAY ALSO WANT 
TO DRIVE THIS POINT HOME AS A WAY TO EMBARRASS 
IRAN; 
 
-- DEMARCATION OF LAND BOUNDARIES AS VOUCHSAFED 
IN PREVIOUS TREATIES INCLUDING THE ALGIERS ACCORD, 
WHICH IRAN FAILED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON.  THE IRAQIS 
NOW OCCUPY ZAYN AL-QAWS, SAIF SA\'D, AND THE OTHER 
TINY SECTORS (ONLY 356 SQ. KM. ALL TOLD), MAKING 
THEIR POSITION NOT ONLY LEGALLY (##) 
MISSION OFFICIALS SPENT 
FOUR YEARS FINDING EVER MORE INGENIOUS WAYS TO AVOID 
THE DEMARCATION, AND SO IRAN CONTINUED TO HOLD ZAYN 
AL-QAWS, SAIF SA\'D, AND THE OTHER POCKETS.  DDING 
TO IRAQI ANGER IS THE FACT THAT IRAN SHELLED BORDER 
TOWNS IN SEPTEMBER 1980 FROM THESE POCKETS -- 
INDEED, THE IRAQIS ARGUE THAT THAT SHELLING WAS THE 
IMMEDIATE TRIGGER OF THE WAR; 
 
-- CANCELLATION OF THE ALGIERS ACCORD INSOFAR AS 
CONCERNS THE SHATT, I.E., RETURN OF SOVEREIGNTY 
TO IRAQ OVER THE ENTIRE RIVER COURSE.  THE IRAQIS 
HAVE LEFT THE ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY OPEN AT PRESENT, 
SAYING THAT THE SHATT SHOULD BE CLEARED FOR UTILI- 
ZATION BY BOTH PARTIES AND SPEAKING INFORMALLY OF 
INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.  BUT IF THE IRANIANS DO 
NOT COME FORWARD ON THEIR OWN OBLIGATIONS UNDER 
THE ACCORD, BOTH IN REFERENCE TO NONINTERFERENCE 
AND DEMARCATION OF LAND BOUNDARIES, THE IRAQIS WILL 
CERTAINLY NOT CONCEDE ON SOVEREIGNTY OVER ALL THE 
RIVER.  (THEY MAY NOT CONCEDE AT ALL.); 
 
-- NO NEGATIVE VERDICT BY THE IMPARTIAL BODY.  WE 
THINK THE IRAQIS UNDERSTAND FULL WELL THAT NO COM- 
MITTEE WILL EVER GIVE IRAQ A POSITIVE VERDICT -- 
THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES ARE A \"NONVERDICT\" 
THAT IMPUGNS BOTH SIDES OR ONE THAT BLAMES IRAQ 
FOR STARTING THE WAR.  THE IRAQIS HAVE ALWAYS 
EXUDED CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF AN 
IMPARTIAL BODY SET UP TO EXAMINE THE GENERALIZED 
ISSUE OF \"RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR,\" AS OPPOSED 
TO THE NARROW QUESTION OF \"WHO STARTED THE WAR\" 
 
-- INDEED, THE IRAQIS CALLED FOR SUCH AN IMPARTIAL 
INQUIRY AS FAR BACK AS 1982.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEY 
ARE NOT EAGER FOR SUCH AN INQUIRY AND INSIST ON 
EXAMINATION OF ISSUES IN 598 IN STRICT SEQUENTIAL 
ORDER; 
 
-- NO REPARATIONS TO IRAN.  A YEAR AGO IF IRAN HAD 
ACCEPTED 598, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL-PLACED, WITH 
MAJNUN AND FAW IN ITS POSSESSION, TO DEMAND BILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS WORTH OF REPARATIONS.  NOW THEY HAVE 
LOST THEIR LEVERAGE.  THE IRAQIS WILL BE UNWILLING 
TO ADMIT THE CONCEPT OF REPARATIONS, AND THEY WILL 
WANT RECONSTRUCTION FOR ONE SIDE TO BE BALANCED BY 
RECONSTRUCTION FOR THE OTHER. 
 
6. IMPORTANT AS THE ABOVE OBJECTIVES ARE FOR IRAQ, 
THE MOST IMPORTANT, AND MOST ELUSIVE, IS AN ASSURANCE 
OF NONINTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS, MEANING 
NONSUPPORT FOR THE KURDS AND THE SHI\'A.  THE IRAQI 
MFA STRESSES TO DIPLOMATS THAT KHOMEINI\'S BREACH 
OF THIS SINGLE ISSUE IN THE ALGIERS ACCORD IS THE 
BASIS FOR IRAQI INSISTENCE THAT IRAN HAS (DE FACTO) 
ABROGATED THE AGREEMENT.  IT WAS THE ASSURANCE OF 
NONINTERFERENCE THAT PROMPTED THE IRAQIS -- SADDAM 
HUSSEIN AS THE PARTY\'S VICE-CHARIMAN AND SA\'DUN 
HAMMADI AS FOREIGN MINISTER -- TO SWALLOW THEIR 
PRIDE IN 1975 AND AGREE TO GIVING UP FULL SOVEREIGNTY 
OVER THE SHATT, SOMETHING THAT IRAQ, AND BEFORE IT 
THE OTTOMANS, HAD ALWAYS STRENUOUSLY INSISTED UPON. 
(IRAQ, UNLIKE IRAN, HAS ONLY A TINY COAST AND VIEWS 
THE TIGRIS-EUPHRATES RIVER SYSTEMS AS ITS OWN, 
NOTE BY OC/T: (##) OMISSION IN TEXT CORRECTION TO FOLLOW... 
COMPLETELY NON-PERSIAN.)  THE SHAH\'S AGREEMENT 
TO NONINTERFERENCE IN 1975 HAD A STUNNINGLY IMMEDIATE 
IMPACT -- MULLA MUSTAFA BARZANI FLED TO THE UNITED 
STATES WITHIN WEEKS AND THE SUDDEN WITHDRAWAL OF 
IRANIAN SUPPORT COMPLETELY DEVASTATED THE 
KURDISH INSURGENCY -- AND A SIMILAR RESULT WOULD 
PROBABLY OCCUR NOW.  HOWEVER, WHILE THE PRESENT 
IRANIAN REGIME HAS BEEN EMPHASIZING THE APPLICABILITY 
OF THE ALGIERS ACCORD TO THE SHATT AL-ARAB, IT HAS 
BREATHED NOTHING  ABOUT ITS OWN PRINCIPAL OBLIGATION 
UNDER THE AGREEMENT. 
 
7. ANOTHER GOAL -- PARTICULARLY TRICKY -- FOR IRAQ 
WILL BE TO ENSURE THAT INTERNATIONAL STRICTURES ON 
SUPPLY OF ARMS TO IRAN CONTINUE AND THAT WESTERN 
FLEETS CONTINUE IN PLACE IN THE GULF.  IRAQ IS 
OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL-PLACED TO PRESSURE EXTERNAL 
POWERS.  THE FACT MAY NOT BE LOST ON THE IRAQIS 
THAT THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IS TO ENSURE 
THAT THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR REMAINS IN THE HEADLINES OF 
THE WORLD MEDIA.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE BEST WAY TO 
DO THAT IS TO OBSTRUCT THE GENEVA PROCESS AND, 
INDEED, TO RENEW HOSTILITIES.  IRAQ WANTS TO BE 
CAREFUL NOT TO DO THIS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BECOME 
ISOLATED OR HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY POINT 
A FINGER DIRECTLY AT IRAQ AS THE CONTINUER OF THE 
WAR. 
 
8. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEDGER, IRANIAN OBJECTIVES 
AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM HERE, ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM 
IRAQ\'S: 
 
-- THE IRANIANS HAVE THE CEASE-FIRE; THE TRICK FOR 
THEM NOW IS TO MAINTAIN IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, 
GIVING AS LITTLE AWAY AS POSSIBLE; 
 
-- THEIR IDEA OF A \"COMPREHENSIVE PEACE\" IS SIMPLY A 
NONAGGRESSION PACT.  IN MAHALLATI\'S MOST RECENT 
PRONOUNCEMENT (TEHRAN RADIO INTERVIEW AUGUST 20, 
FBIS NC2008073888) THE ONLY SPECIFIC POINT HE MEN- 
TIONED THAT IS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE GENEVA TALKS 
IS \"STEPS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO PREVENT RENEWED 
AGGRESSION.\" 
 
-- REASSERTION OF THE ALGIERS ACCORD ONLY IN REGARD 
TO SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SHATT, I.E., BOUNDARY AT THE 
THALWEG, WITHOUT MAKING ANY COMMITMENTS ON NONINTER- 
FERENCE OR DEMARCATION OF BORDERS; 
 
-- INSISTENCE ON RIGHT TO INSPECT ALL VESSELS IN THE 
GULF AND TO CONFISCATE ALL WAR-RELATED MATERIEL, 
INCLUDING SEIZING WARSHIPS; 
 
-- VERDICT BY THE IMPARTIAL BODY (WHICH THE IRANIANS 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE STACKED WITH PARTIES OF THEIR 
CHOOSING) COMPLETELY IN IRAN\'S FAVOR; 
 
-- MASIVE REPARATIONS ONLY TO IRAN; 
 
-- PERIOD OF QUIET IN WHICH THE WORLD FORGETS ABOUT 
IRAN AND IRAQ, THE WESTERN FLEETS GO HOME, STRICTURES 
ON ARMS DELIVERIES ARE LIFTED. 
 
9. THE IRANIAN CONCEPT OF THE DIRECT TALKS AT GENEVA 
IS ALREADY BECOMING CLEAR.  AS MUCH AS THE IRANIANS 
PURPORT TO BELIEVE THAT THE SECRETARY GENERAL IS 
COMPLETELY ON THEIR SIDE, THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THE 
PLAIN LANGUAGE IN HIS AUGUST 8 LETTER, SENT IDENTICALLY 
TO BOTH TEHRAN AND BAGHDAD: \"BOTH GOVERNMENTS HAVE 
AGREED THAT DIRECT TALKS SHALL BE HELD UNDER MY 
AUSPICES TO REACH A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE OTHER 
PROVISIONS OF RESOLUTION 598.\"  TO THE CONTRARY, IN 
THE IRANIAN VIEW (AGAIN, MAHALLATI\'S AUGUST 20 IN- 
TERVIEW), \"THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL HAS BEEN GRANTED 
THE RIGHT TO INVITE BOTH SIDES TO TALK ONLY ABOUT 
ARTICLE 4 OF THE RESOLUTION, AND NOT THE TOPICS 
INCLUDED IN ARTICLES 1-8.\"  ARTICLE 4 DEALS WITH 
\"ALL OUTSTANDING ISSUES,\" I.E., THOSE NOT SPECIFICALLY 
ADDRESSED IN THE RESOLUTION. 
 
10. ANOTHER ELEMENT CALLING FOR PESSIMISM ABOUT THE 
HARMONIOUS PROGRESS OF TALKS IN GENEVA IS IRAQ\'S 
DEEP DISTRUST OF PEREZ DE CUELLAR.  WELL AWARE OF 
THIS DISTRUST, THE SYG MIGHT HAVE MOVED QUICKLY TO 
FIND A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, 
BUT HE HAS NOT YET DONE SO, AND INSTEAD HE IS SEEN 
AS JEALOUSLY GUARDING LEADERSHIP OF THE PROCESS IN 
HIS OWN HANDS AND OF ONE SUBORDINATE, GIANNI PICCO 
(WHOM THE IRAQIS HAVE ALSO TAKEN A DISLIKE TO, 
APPARENTLY).  RECRIMINATIONS ROSE TO A CRESCENDO 
DURING THE PAST WEEK, WITH THE IRAQIS BELIEVING 
THE SYG WAS ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE A FORESHADOWING OF 
HIS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, INCLUDING A REFERENCE TO 
THE ALGIERS ACCORD.  THE SYG HAS ALLOWED HIMSELF 
TO APPEAR TO BE ARGUING THE IRANIANS\' BRIEF, WITH 
INCALCULABLE DETRIMENT TO HIS STANDING AS AN IMPARTIAL 
ASSISTANT TO THE PROCESS. 
 
11. INITIAL PROCEDURAL ISSUES IN GENEVA -- NOT TO 
MENTION SUBSTANCE -- ARE LIKELY TO BE DIFFICULT. 
THE IRAQIS WILL REACT SHARPLY TO ANY SUGGESTIONS 
ON PROCEDURE THAT APPEAR TO BE IMPOSED BY THE SYG. 
THEY WILL PROBABLY INSIST THAT EVEN THE MOST MUNDANE 
MATTERS OF PROCEDURE BE WORKED OUT DIRECTLY BY THE 
TWO PARTIES.  THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT A PREARRANGED 
AGENDA -- IN THEIR EMPHASIS ON STRICT SEQUENTIALITY, 
THE IRAQIS HAVE SIGNALED THAT AN AGENDA IS NOT \"MERE\" 
PROCEDURE FOR THEM. 
 
12. FOR DCM MARSH IN GENEVA: AN EXCELLENT CONTACT 
IN THE IRAQI DELEGATION WILL BE DR. RIYAD AL-QAYSI. 
(AMBASSADOR HAS AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM THIS EVENING, 
AUGUST 23, JUST BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE.)  HE HAS BEEN 
THE FOREMOST INTERNATIONAL JURIST IN THE IRAQI MFA 
FOR OVER A DECADE.  WHILE OFFICIALLY HE IS DIRECTOR 
OF THE MFA INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OFFICE, HE 
HAS BEEN WORKING FULL TIME FOR OVER A YEAR ON 
BUILDING THE IRAQI LEGAL CASE FOR THE IMPARTIAL 
COMMITTEE (IF IT IS EVER ESTABLISHED) AND FOR ALL 
OTHER MATTERS IN 598; HE KNOWS     EVERY ASPECT, 
DOWN TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL, OF THE CENTURIES- 
OLD BORDER/SHATT DISPUTE.  QAYSI HAS A SHARP MIND 
AND IS AN ENGAGING INTERLOCUTOR, ALTHOUGH HE CAN 
BE OVERLY LEGALISTIC.  AS DEPARTMENT HAS INFORMED 
YOU, THE IRAQI DELEGATION WILL ALSO INCLUDE PERMANENT 
REPRESENTATIVE KITTANI AND AMBASSADOR ANBARI.  MFA 
HAS INFORMED US THAT ANBARI WAS ASSIGNED TO THE 
IRAQI DELEGATION BECAUSE OF HIS OWN LEGAL BACKGROUND 
(ANOTHER LAWYER -- THE IRAQIS WILL BE FULLY PREPARED 
TO BE STICKLERS, AS THE NEED ARISES).

1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  WHILE STILL CELEBRATING ITS \"VICTORY\" 
IN THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, IRAQ APPEARS BENT ON RETURNING 
TO NORMALCY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  EMPHASIS IS LAID 
ON BASRA\'S RESURRECTION AND THE RE-OPENING OF THE PORT 
OF UMM QASR.  MEANWHILE, IRAQ DENIED THAT IRAN HAD 
SEARCHED AN IRAQI SHIP AND WARNED THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO 
DO SO WOULD BRING REPERCUSSIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IRAQIS CELEBRATED THE OFFICIAL CEASEFIRE WITH AS 
MUCH ENTHUSIASM AS THEY DID THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 
CEASEFIRE ON AUGUST 8, BUT WITHOUT THE WIDESPREAD 
DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS WHICH MARKED THE EARLIER CELE- 
BRATIONS.  JUBILANT CROWDS SURGED THROUGH THE STREETS 
DURING THE EVENING HOURS OF AUGUST 19-21.  PRESIDENT 
SADDAM HUSSEIN ATTENDED A HUGE GOVERNMENT RALLY AT 
GREAT FESTIVITIES SQUARE IN BAGHDAD AUGUST 20; 
UNUSUALLY FOR HIM, HE PERMITTED A THRONG OF 
THOUSANDS TO CONVERGE ON HIM.  ON THE SPUR OF THE 
MOMENT, HE DECLARED AUGUST 21 A NATIONAL HOLIDAY. 
THE MEDIA REPORTED THAT \"TENS OF THOUSANDS\" OF 
PILGRIMS RENEWED THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO SADDAM ON VISITS 
DURING THE SHI\'A HOLY DAY OF ASHURA (AUGUST 22) TO 
THE \"SHRINE OF SADDAM\'S GREAT ANCESTOR\" THE IMAM 
HUSAYN,. IN THE SHI\'A HOLY CITY OF KARBALA.  (ONE 
SHI\'A PILGRIM TO KARBALA TELLS US, HOWEVER, THAT 
REVERENCE TO SADDAM HAD NO PART AT ALL IN THIS YEAR\'S 
ASHURA CELEBRATION.) 
 
4.  AS THE CELEBRATIONS CONTINUED, THE IRAQIS OPENED 
THE AIRPORT AT BASRA TO CIVILIAN AIR TRAFFIC 
AUGUST 20, AND RE-OPENED THE PORTS OF UMM QASR 
AND KHOR AL-ZUBAIR TO MERCHANT SHIPPING.  REPORTS 
IN BAGHDAD CLAIM BASRA HAS BEEN GIVEN FIRST CALL ON 
WHATEVER IS NEEDED TO RETURN THE TOWN TO ITS PREWAR 
CONDITION AND ITS STATUS AS IRAQ\'S SECOND LARGEST 
CITY.  MOST OF BASRA\'S POPULATION, HALF OF WHICH 
FLED THE CITY DURING THE WAR, HAS NOW RETURNED. 
NOW, PAINT AND BUILDING MATERIALS ARE REPORTEDLY 
BEING DIVERTED THERE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT SHORTAGES 
ARE FEARED ELSEWHERE IN IRAQ.  GULF AIR, OWNED BY 
THE GOVERNMENTS OF BAHRAIN, QATAR, OMAN, AND ABU 
DHABI, ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD RESUME SERVICE TO 
BAGHDAD AND TEHRAN. 
 
5.  IRAQ\'S NAVAL COMMANDER DENIED THAT IRAN HAD 
SEARCHED AN IRAQI MERCHANT VESSEL IN THE GULF 
AUGUST 20, AND CLAIMED THAT IRANIANS HAD NOT BEEN 
ALLOWED TO BOARD THE IRAQI SHIP.  THE IRANIANS SENT 
A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP TO HOVER ABOVE THE VESSEL WHILE 
AN IRANIAN NAVAL SHIP SHADOWED IT, HE SAID.  THE 
COMMANDER DECLARED THAT IRAQ WAS DETERMINED TO 
EXERCISE FULLY ITS RIGHTS TO FREE NAVIGATION IN 
INTERNATIONAL WATERS, AND WOULD COUNTER ANY IRANIAN 
MOVE WHICH INTERFERED WITH THESE RIGHTS.

THAT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEHRAN IS BEING REFURBISHED 
AND NOTE THAT \"NO ONE IN TEHRAN CURSES THE ARCH

3.  IRAQI MEDIA AUGUST 22, GAVE PROMINENT COVERAGE 
TO REPORTS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN THE MADRID 
NEWSPAPER EL PAIS AND THE PARIS WEEKLY EXPRESS, 
THAT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY BUILDINGS IN TEHRAN ARE 
BEING REFURBISHED.  EXPRESS IS QUOTED THAT THE 
IRANIAN REGIME INTENDS TO VINDICATE THE \"GREAT 
SATAN,\" WHILE EL PAIS IS REPORTEDLY MORE EXPLICIT, 
DECLARING THAT IRAN IS MOVING QUICKLY TO REESTAB- 
LISH RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  EL PAIS\'S 
TEHRAN CORRESPONDENT REPORTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE 
UNDERWAY AT THE U.S. EMBASSY TO REINSTATE NORMAL 
ACTIVITIES. 
 
4. ALSO ON AUGUST 22, THE MAIN EDITORIAL IN BOTH THE 
BA\'TH PARTY AND GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPERS (THAWRA AND 
JUMHURIYA) WARNED THAT UNNAMED POWERS ARE \"MANEUVERING 
TO DEPRIVE IRAQ OF ITS VICTORY.\"  THESE POWERS ARE 
ACCUSED OF TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE UPCOMING NEGOTIA- 
TIONS TO REGAIN THEIR LOST INFLUENCE IN IRAN.  A 
SIMILAR EDITORIAL IN THAWRA ON AUGUST 21 CLAIMED 
THAT \"NO ONE IN THE CAPITALS OF THESE STATES ANY 
LONGER CONDEMNS IRANIAN STATE TERRORISM OR IRANIAN 
EXTORTION THROUGH HOLDING HOSTAGES.  AT THE SAME 
TIME, NO ONE IN TEHRAN CURSES OR REMEMBERS THE ARCH 
SATAN ANY LONGER\" (FBIS JN2108072288). 
 
5. COMMENT: THE IRAQIS\' FEAR OF U.S.-IRAN RAPPROACHE- 
MENT HAS BEEN REFLECTED MORE PROMINENTLY IN THE PAST 
WEEK\'S MEDIA THAN PREVIOUSLY.  WE WOULD ASSUME SADDAM 
GAVE A SIGNAL OF CONCERN TO HIS INFORMATION MINISTER 
JASIM, WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN READY TO ABUSE THE UNITED 
STATES.  WHAT IS NOT CLEAR TO US IS WHAT THE U.S. 
HAS DONE, SINCE THE TALABANI AFFAIR AT LEAST, THAT 
WOULD HAVE SPURRED THIS CONCERN.

2.  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON MFA UNDERSECRETARY HAMDUN 
ON JUNE 5 TO RESUME DIALOGUE ON THE PROBLEM OF 
SOVIET ARMS SALES TO IRAN.  POINTING OUT THAT 
REFTEL HAD BEEN DRAFTED PRIOR TO THE NEWS OF 
KHOMEINI\'S DEATH, AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT WHATEVER 
GOVERNMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY EMERGE IN TEHRAN, 
FOR THE MOMENT  WE HAVE A RAFSANJANI VISIT SCHEDULED 
FOR MOSCOW JUNE  21.  WE ARE URGING GULF CAPITALS 
TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO REGISTER WITH THE SOVIETS 
CLEARLY THAT THERE WILL BE STRONG NEGATIVE ARAB 
REACTION TO RESUMPTION OF ARMS DELIVERIES TO IRAN. 
 
3.  AMBASSADOR THEN WENT THROUGH TICKS IN PARA FOUR 
REFTEL, REITERATING THAT WE WERE GRATEFUL FOR THE 
IRAQIS CONTINUING TO SHARE WITH US THEIR THOUGHTS 
AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE OF GRAVE MUTUAL 
CONCERN TO BOTH OF OUR GOVERNMENTS. 
 
4.  HAMDUN RESPONDED THAT HE DID HAVE SOMETHING TO 
REPORT.  FOR THE FIRST TIME  THE SOVIETS HAVE 
ADMITTED TO THE GOI THAT THEY DO INTEND TO SELLARMS, 
THOUGH REFUSING TO GIVE ANY SPECIFICS.  THEY CLAIM 
THEY WOULD NOT GIVE IRAN    EVERYTHING IT ASKED FOR 
AND THAT THE ARMS PACKAGE WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO TIP 
THE REGIONAL BALANCE.  THE SOVIETS\' JUSTIFICATION 
TO THE IRAQIS WAS SIMPLE -- IF MOSCOW DOES NOT SELL 
THE ARMS THE WEST WILL. 
 
5.  FOR ITS PART, HAMDUN SAID, IRAQ CONTINUES TO 
MAKE ITS POSITION CLEAR TO THE SOVIETS, AND HAS 
ASKED KUWAIT, YAR, JORDAN, AND EGYPT, 
TO DO SO AS WELL.  WITH REGARD TO THE GULF, 
HOWEVER, HAMDUN EMPHASIZED, THE SOVIETS ARE 
PROBABLY PLAYING ON A SECOND TRACK.  IRAQ BELIEVES 
MOSCOW IS TRYING TO SET UP AN \"AXIS\" TO INCLUDE 
THE KABUL REGIME, IRAN, AND THE IRANIAN BASED 
MUJAHIDIN: I.E. THEY ARE SEEKING ANY 
JUSTIFICATION FOR ARMS SALES TO TEHRAN WHICH WILL 
AT THE SAME TIME HELP THEIR POSITION IN 
AFGHANISTAN.  EVIDENCE FOR THIS HYPOTHESIS 
HAD COME FROM REPORTED REMARKS BY THE SOVIET 
AMBASSADOR TO THE UAE. 
 
6.  ACTION RECOMMENDED:  AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT 
HAMDUN RECOMMENDED BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS COULD 
OR SHOULD DO NEXT.  HE SUGGESTED WE BOTH MAKE AN 
APPROACH NOW, ALONG THE LINES OF REFTEL, TO THE 
EGYPTIANS.  AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THIS WAS A 
SENSIBLE COURSE OF ACTION AND SAID SHE   WOULD 
CONVEY THIS PROPOSAL IMMEDIATELY TO THE DEPARTMENT.

3.  THE WESTERN EMBASSY NOTES THAT THE IRANIAN 
PRESS CLAIMED THAT THE RIOTS BEGAN BECAUSE A 
FOOTBALL GAME WAS POSTPONED DUE TO BAD 
WEATHER MAKING THE TURF UNSUITABLE FOR PLAY. 
THE EMBASSY BELIEVES THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE

FIVE THOUSAND THREW STONES AND CARRIED 
PICTURES OF THE SHAH\'S SON.  THE PRESENCE 
OF THE PICTURES SUGGESTS A PRE-ARRANGED, 
NOT SPONTANEOUS, DEMONSTRATION, AND FURTHER 
SUGGESTS THAT CANCELATION OF THE FOOTBALL 
GAME WAS NOT BECAUSE OF A WET PITCH.  FURTHER, 
SLOGANS WERE SHOUTED AGAINST THE REGIME 
AND SOME SHOTS WERE HEARD. 
 
 
4.  THE EMBASSY IN TEHRAN NOTES THAT THE 
CLAIMS OF THE MUJAHIDIN FROM BAGHDAD WERE 
MUCH EXAGGERATED (COMMENT: AS USUAL), BUT 
CLEARLY ANY DEMONSTRATION MUST WORRY THE 
IRANIAN REGIME.  RUMORS ARE BEGINNING TO FLOOD

MILITARY ACTIVITY THAN USUAL HAS BEEN 
NOTED IN THE CITY.

CALLING FOR A MIDDLE EAST FREE OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION CAME TOO LATE FOR INCLUSION IN BAGHDAD 
NEWSPAPERS APRIL 9.  WHAT IS IN THE PRESS--AGAIN, 
TWO DAYS AFTER THE EVENT--IS THE JOINT MUBARAK-SADDAM 
HUSAYN PRESS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE END OF MUBARAK\'S 
BRIEF APRIL 7 VISIT TO IRAQ (REFTEL).  DURING THAT 
CONFERENCE, SADDAM REPEATED OLD ARGUMENTS IN HIS 
ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY AND DEFEND HIS RECENT STATEMENTS, 
BUT DID NOT RETRACT THEM, AND BLAMED THE U.S. FOR 
THE CLOUDS DARKENING U.S.-IRAQI RELATIONS.  HIS ONE 
NEW IDEA: ARABS SHOULD UNDERTAKE COMMON SECURITY 
GUARANTEES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ON CW - STILL UNREPENTANT 
------------------------- 
 
3.  SADDAM CONTINUES TO REVEAL THAT HE CANNOT AND 
DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HIS APRIL 1 REMARKS ON CW 
CREATED SUCH A FUROR.  GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
RETRACT OR MODIFY THEM, HE INSTEAD INSISTED, 
\"THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG IN WHAT WE SAID.\" 
FOLLOWING HIS OLD ARGUMENTS, HE TRIED TO EXCUSE 
IRAQ\'S CW CAPABILITY BY TYING IT TO ISRAEL\'S 
NUCLEAR BOMB, COMPLAINING THAT PEOPLE ASSUME IRAQ 
WILL USE ITS CW (AND CONDEMN IRAQ FOR THAT), WHILE 
ASSUMING ISRAEL WILL NOT/NOT USE ITS NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS.  THE WESTERN MEDIA ARE CONCENTRATING ON 
IRAQ\'S CW AND IGNORE ISRAEL\'S CW, BW AND NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS.  (THIS ARGUMENT WAS FURTHER DEVELOPED BY 
MFA UNDER SECRETARY HAMDUN TO THE AMBASSADOR 
APRIL 8--BAGHDAD 2084.) 
 
U.S.-IRAQI RELATIONS: DARK CLOUDS 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  MUBARAK WAS CAREFUL NOT/NOT TO CRITICIZE THE 
U.S., AND SO WAS SADDAM.  ON THE PRESENT POOR 
STATE OF RELATIONS, SADDAM LIMITED HIMSELF TO: 
\"WE SEE CLOUDS DARKENING IRAQI-U.S. RELATIONS 
WHENEVER THE ZIONIST LOBBY INTERVENES IN AMERICAN 
POLICY AND WHENEVER AMERICAN POLICY ERRS IN 
ASSESSING THE SITUATION.\"  HE EMPHASIZED IRAQ 
WANTS NOT JUST GOOD, BUT FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH 
ALL STATES. 
 
BUT IRAQ WANTS PEACE 
-------------------- 
 
5.  BOTH PRESIDENTS WERE AT PAINS TO STRESS THAT IRAQ 
WANTS PEACE.  TRYING TO GET HIS BASIC MESSAGE 
ACROSS, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE 
SADDAM EMPHASIZED THAT IRAQ AND THE ARAB NATION 
WANT PEACE.  HE CITED AS AN EXAMPLE IRAQ\'S EFFORTS 
TO MAKE PEACE WITH IRAN EVEN BEFORE THE WAR ENDED. 
BUT, HE WARNED, \"WE WILL NOT CONCEDE RIGHTS THAT 
RIGHTLY BELONG TO US IN OUR DISPUTE WITH IRAN.\" 
MUBARAK ECHOED SADDAM\'S GENERAL SENTIMENTS. 
ACKNOWLEDGING IRAQ HAS FACED A HOSTILE CAMPAIGN 
(A SOP TO HIS HOST), AND CONTINUING HIS EFFORTS TO 
DEFUSE THE TENSIONS CREATED BY SADDAM\'S APRIL 1 
SPEECH (CAIRO 7329), MUBARAK AVERRED THAT \"IRAQ IS 
NOT A COUNTRY THAT WANTS WAR OR ADVOCATES WAR.  IT 
IS INDEED A COUNTRY THAT WANTS PEACE.\" 
 
6.  CLEARLY CUT BY WESTERN MEDIA REMARKS, SADDAM 
REPEATEDLY COMPLAINED THAT IRAQ IS NOT \"WARMONGERING.\" 
\"IRAQ HAS COMMITTED AGGRESSION AGAINST NO ONE,\" HE 
SAID.  ALL IT DID WAS EXECUTE A SPY AND TRY TO BUY 
\"SIMPLE ITEMS.\"  SADDAM ARGUED THAT THE REAL 
\"AGGRESSION\" IS DENYING IRAQ ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY 
AND TRYING TO ENTRAP IT.  IRAQ HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND 
ITSELF AGAINST AGGRESSION. 
 
 
UNITED WE STAND 
--------------- 
 
7.  BOTH PRESIDENTS TOOK UP SADDAM\'S THEME THAT 
A UNITED ARAB POSITION WOULD STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUAL 
ARAB COUNTRIES.  MUBARAK CALLED FOR \"GENERAL 
COORDINATION\" TO GUARANTEE ARAB NATIONAL SECURITY. 
SADDAM WENT FURTHER, ADVOCATING \"COMMON GUARDS\"-- 
ARMY, POLICY AND BORDER GUARDS--AT OUR GATES AND 
OPEN GATES WITHIN THE ARAB NATION.  IF REAL SECURITY 
COOPERATION EXISTED, IRAQ COULD DISBAND 30 (OF 50) 
DIVISIONS AND USE THE MONEY SAVED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND 
TO IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF IRAQIS.  IF 
ARABS MEANT WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT UNIRY IN 1980, 
IRAN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ATTACK IRAQ, SADDAM 
SAID TESTILY. 
 
PROHIBITIONS ON ARABS MUST END 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  AS IN HIS EARLIER SPEECHES, SADDAM COMPLAINED . 
THAT ARABS ARE TREATED AS SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. 
(COMMENT:  PERHPAS STEMMING FROM HIS LIFELONG EFFORT 
TO PROMOTE A SENSE OF IDENTITY FOR \"IRAQIS\"--A SENSE 
HE OFTEN RECALLS HE LACKED AS A CHILD--SADDAM IS 
DWELLING MORE AND MORE ON THE THEME THAT ARABS ARE 
SEEN FROM ABROAD AS SECOND-CLASS HUMAN BEINGS; E.G., 
THE ISRAELIS CAN BE TRUSTED WITH CHEMICAL AND 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, WHILE THE 
ARABS CANNOT.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  WITH MUBARAK AT HIS SIDE AND FOLLOWING SEVERAL 
HOURS OF CONVERSATION, SADDAM APPEARED SOMEWHAT 
SUBDUED AND DEFENSIVE, CERTAINLY LESS ASSERTIVE 
THAN DURING HIS APRIL TALK WITH HIS OWN MOD STAFF. 
 
10. WE HOPE EMBASSY CAIRO WILL BE ABLE TO ELICIT 
WHETHER THE EGYPTIANS THINK THEY MADE SOME PROGRESS 
IN DEFUSING TENSIONS WHILE THEY WERE IN BAGHDAD. 
THE TASK WILL BE DIFFICULT.  SADDAM IS NOT/NOT 
POSTURING.  HE IS GENUINELY CONCERNED ABOUT ISRAEL 
AND IRAN (WITNESS MOHTASHAMI-FUR\'S CONTEMPT FOR ANY 
DIPLOMACY AND HIS CALL FOR JIHAD AGAINST IRAQ-- 
FBIS NC0704195090). 
 
11.  THOSE CONCERNS NOTWITHSTANDING, SADDAM SEES 
HIMSELF PLAYING A BROADENING LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE 
ARAB WORLD.  HISTORICALLY, THE IRAQIS DO NOT TAKE 
KINDLY TO BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO BY THEIR 
CENTURIES-OLD RIVALS.  IF MUBARAK TRULY WANTS TO DRAW 
SADDAM INTO HIS REGIONAL INITIATIVE, HIS DIPLOMATIC 
TASK WILL BE A DELICATE AND CHALLENGING ONE.

BEEN SADDAM\'S MEETINGS WITH A \"GROUP\" WHICH IS 
MAKING THE FINAL CHANGES IN THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION 
PRIOR TO DISCUSSION BY THE RCC AND THE PARTY\'S 
REGIONAL COMMAND. 
 
3.  WE THINK DEPARTMENT\'S BIOGRAPHIC FILES SHOULD 
REFLECT THE NAMES OF THE SIX-MEMBER GROUP WHO 
SADDAM HAS SPENT SO MANY HOURS WITH ON THIS 
IMPORTANT PROJECT AND WHOSE VIEWS, THEREFORE, 
WE ASSUME HE VALUES.  ALL SIX, WEARING THEIR 
PARTY UNIFORMS, ARE PICTURED IN THE MEDIA 
SITTING IN WHAT IS OFTEN USED AS THE CABINET ROOM. 
THEY ARE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTERS SA\'DUN HAMMADI AND 
TARIQ AZIZ, FLANKING THE PRESIDENT, PRESUMABLY 
REFLECTING THEIR SENIOR STATUS.  NEXT TO TARIQ 
AZIZ IS SPEAKER SALIH (WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF THE 
BAGHDAD BRANCH OF THE PARTY); AND THEN AHMAD 
HUSAYN AL-SAMARA\'I.  THE LATTER CARRIES THE RANK OF 
A CABINET MINISTER HAVING BEEN MINISTER OF YOUTH; 
HE.IS NOW SYG OF THE PRESIDENT\'S DIWAN AND, WE 
ARE TOLD, HIS \"FRIEND.\"  FLANKING SA\'DUN IS 
MINISTER OF INFORMATION JASIM AND, FINALLY, HAMID 
YUSUF HUMMADI. 
 
4.  HUMMADI, WITH WHOM THE AMBASSADOR FIRST HAD 
A SUBSTANTIVE EXCHANGE WHEN SHE WAS TRAPPED WITH 
HIM IN AN ELEVATOR DURING THE DOLE VISIT LAST 
MONTH, IS A TIKRITI AND A GRADUATE OF BAGHDAD 
UNIVERSITY IN ENGLISH.  DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE 
HIS BASIC BIO, WHICH SHOWS HIS APPOINTMENT IN 
EARLY 1979 AS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE 
PRESIDENT\'S DIWAN, THEN LATER THAT YEAR AS THE 
PRESIDENT\'S PERSONAL SECRETARY.  HIS ENGLISH IS 
EXCELLENT, AND WE ARE TOLD HE STUDIED WITH 
TARIQ AZIZ, WHO IS HIS GOOD FRIEND.  HIS POWER IS 
CONSIDERABLE; E.G., A CALL FROM HIM STOPPED THE 
MINISTER OF INTERIOR IN HIS TRACKS AFTER HE HAD 
ORDERED THE REMOVAL OF THE CHECKPOINT IN FRONT 
OF THE EMBASSY LAST MONTH, AND WE WERE IN RECEIPT 
OF PROFUSE APOLOGIES FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT.

RAFSANJANI\'S JUNE 6 INTERVIEW IN WHICH HE 
COMMENTS INTER ALIA ON THE POSSIBILITY OF 
A MEETING WITH SADDAM (TEHRAN RADIO VERSION 
IN REF B).  IN SUMMARY, RAFSANJANI SAID THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A MEETING WILL DEPEND ON 
NEGOTIATIONS AT THE EXPERT LEVEL AND \"UNDER 
THE SUPERVISION\" OF THE SYG (TEHRAN RADIO) OR 
\"IN CONSULTATION WITH\" THE SECRETARY GENERAL 
(IRANIAN NEWS SERVICE). 
 
3.  RAFSANJANI(AND OTHER SENIOR IRANIANS EARLIER) 
ALSO COMPLAINS ABOUT THE BAGHDAD SUMMIT COMMUNIQUE 
REMARKS ON IRAN.  THE IRAQI MFA HAS TOLD US THAT 
IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THIS ADVERSE IRANIAN REACTION, 
SINCE THE COMMUNIQUE SIMPLY REITERATED THE LANGUAGE 
OF THE CASABLANCA COMMUNIQUE, ADDING ONLY REFERENCE 
TO SADDAM\'S RECENT \"MESSAGE OF PEACE\" TO IRAN. 
 
4.  ON JUNE 6, THE PALESTINIAN \"AMBASSADOR\" TO 
IRAQ (FATAH) CONFIDED TO THE DUTCH AMBASSADOR THAT 
THE FIRST SADDAM LETTER HAD BEEN CARRIED BY AN ARAFAT 
EMISSARY TO TEHRAN.  RAFSANJANI\'S RESPONSE HAD 
BEEN HANDED BY THE IRANIAN OIL MINISTER TO HIS 
IRAQI COUNTERPART AT AN OPEC MEETING.  THE SECOND 
SADDAM LETTER, HE ASSERTED, HAD ALSO MOVED DIRECTLY 
FROM AN IRAQI TO AN IRANIAN. 
 
5.  WITHOUT MAKING CLEAR WHETHER HE HAD SEEN THE 
LETTER HIMSELF, THE PALESTINIAN SAID THAT 
SADDAM\'S FIRST MESSAGE HAD INVITED IRAN TO 
LOOK TOWARD REESTABLISHING RELATIONS THROUGH 
DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS AT THE SUMMIT, WITH AN 
OPEN AGENDA, AND HAD NOTED THAT LIKE IRAN, IRAQ 
IS THREATENED BY ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES. 
 
6.  FINALLY, THE PALESTINIAN CLAIMED THAT AN ARAFAT 
ENVOY IS EVEN NOW CARRYING A PLO LETTER TO 
RAFSANJANI, BUT THAT ARAFAT WOULD HIMSELF GO TO 
TEHRAN ONLY IF TANGIBLE RESULTS OF MEDIATION WERE 
IMMINENT; E.G., ON A POW EXCHANGE OR TO FIX 
A DATE FOR IRAN-IRAQ TALKS. 
 
7.  COMMENT:  WE HAVE NOTED PRESS REPORTS THAT 
ARAFAT IS NOT/NOT WELCOME IN TEHRAN NOR IS HIS 
MEDIATION.  WE ALSO NOTE SPECULATION THAT 
THE OMANIS HAVE BEEN CARRYING THE MESSAGES.  WE 
CANNOT EVALUATE THE PALESTINIAN\'S COMMENTS, ALTHOUGH 
WHY HE WOULD FABRICATE ALL THIS TO IMPRESS THE 
DUTCH AMBASSADOR IS DIFFICULT TO FATHOM.

REF: (A) STATE 187203, (B) FBIS LD0106133190, 
(C) KUWAIT 3083 
 
1.  (U)  A NUMBER OF RUMORS ARE CIRCULATING IN 
THE REGION ABOUT RECENT ABORTIVE COUP ATTEMPTS. 
THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE RUMORS ARE NOT FRIENDS 
OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT.  FOR EXAMPLE: 
 
--AL TAYYAR AL-JADID (IRAQI SHI\'A OPPOSITION 
PAMPHLET IN LONDON): ARRESTS IN MAY OF \"HUNDREDS\" 
OF ARMY OFFICERS AND CIVILIANS, INCLUDING 
SADDAM\'S ADVISOR AND RELATIVE, FADIL BARRAK 
(FORMER HEAD OF IRAQI CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE); 
 
--TEHRAN DOMESTIC SERVICE: 17 PILOTS EXECUTED 
IN EARLY APRIL; 
 
--TURCOMAN (TURKISH PUBLICATION, PRESUMABLY 
BY TURKOMANS):  ARRESTS AND EXECUTIONS, 
INCLUDING OF A GENERAL OFFICER NAMED DHIA 
AL-KAN\'AN (THERE IS A TURCOMAN FAMILY OF THAT 
NAME IN KIRKUK). 
 
2.  (C)  DESPITE THE OBVIOUSLY SUSPECT PROVENANCE 
OF THESE ASSERTIONS, WISHFUL THINKING BY 
ANTI-SADDAM GROUPS GIVE SUCH STORIES MORE 
CURRENCY THAN THEY DESERVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
EMBASSY KUWAIT REPORTS THAT THE INTELLIGENT 
AND SENSIBLE KUWAITI MINISTER OF OIL HAS TOLD 
TWO RECENT AMERICAN VISITORS THAT SADDAM\'S NEW, 
TOUGH PUBLIC POSTURING ON FOREIGN POLICY MAY BE 
A REACTION TO \"INTERNAL PRESSURES AND 
INSTABILITY OF HIS REGIME.\"  IN THIS, SHAYKH ALI, 
WE BELIEVE, IS ENTIRELY WRONG.  THE KUWAITI 
AMBASSADOR HERE SHARES OUR ASSESSMENT THAT SADDAM 
IS DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, BUT THESE DO 
NOT INCLUDE ANY SPECIAL OR NEW CONCERN ABOUT 
COUP PLOTTING. 
 
3.  (C)  WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE 
NOT OCCASIONAL \"DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS\" HERE. 
FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRESIDENT\'S LONG-TIME KURDISH 
ADC, SABAH MIRZA, UNDOUBTEDLY BLOTTED HIS COPY 
BOOK THIS YEAR.  HE WAS ARRESTED AND MAY BE 
DEAD.  NOR ARE WE SUGGESTING THAT AN ABORTIVE 
COUP WOULD NECESSARILY BE DETECTED BY WESTERN 
EMBASSIES HERE.  WE DO NOT, HOWEVER, HAVE ANY 
EVIDENCE OF A GROUND SWELL OF ACTIVE ANTI-SADDAM 
SENTIMENT OR ACTIVITY. 
 
4.  (C)  FURTHER, SADDAM IS WORKING HARD TO 
DO WHAT HE CAN TO RELIEVE HIS NEED TO DEPEND 
ENTIRELY ON HIS VERY EFFECTIVE SECRET SERVICES. 
CURRENT EXAMPLES ARE HIS HIGHLY PUBLICIZED 
AND PERSONAL WORK ON REVIEW OF THE DRAFT 
CONSTITUTION AND HIS TIRELESS WALKABOUTS 
IN OBSCURE VILLAGES AND MAJOR TOWNS TO INSPECT 
AND IMPROVE CITIZENS\' WELFARE. THE PARTY 
HAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT THOUSANDS 
OF CHEERING ARAB (NOT KURDISH) IRAQIS TO 
GREET THEIR PRESIDENT. 
 
5.  (S)  FINALLY, WE INVITE ATTENTION TO 
UNEVALUATED INTELLIGENCE ON THESE ISSUES. 
A GOODS-OR BAD-- EXAMPLE IS IIR 2 762 0096 90 
(CDRUSAOPSGP), WHICH HAS BARRAK  ARRESTED 
AND DEAD IN 1989, A PERIOD WHEN HIS PICTURE 
APPEARED IN THE PRESS WITH SADDAM AND MORE THAN 
ONE AMERICAN HAD LUNCH WITH HIM.

SUBJECT: PUBLIC IRAQI GESTURE TOWARD THE USG 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  THE BAGHDAD MORNING NEWSPAPERS ON JULY 2, 
THE FIRST DAY OF \'ID AL-ADHA, BROUGHT A VIRTUAL 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF SADDAM\'S DESIRE FOR BETTER 
RELATIONS WITH THE USG.  ALL FOUR ARABIC 
LANGUAGE DAILIES FEATURE ONE RPT ONE \'ID 
MESSAGE TO SADDAM, AND THAT MESSAGE IN ALL 
DAILIES IS BOXED IN A FEATURED POSITION 
UNDER A HEADLINE: \"THE PRESIDENT RECEIVES \'ID 
GREETINGS FROM THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.\"  THE 
ENTIRE TEXT OF PRESIDENT BUSHES MESSAGE, 
INCLUDING THE SIGNATURE AND SALUTATION LINES, 
ARE PRINTED. 
 
3.  WE HAD RECEIVED THE PRESIDENT\'S GREETINGS 
BY CABLE AT MID-DAY JULY 1, AND THE MFA PROTOCOL 
OFFICE KEPT ONE OFFICER PRESENT TO RECEIVE THE 
MESSAGE (EVERY ONE WAS DEPARTING EARLY TO BEGIN 
\'ID CELEBRATIONS) UNTIL WE COULD GET THERE. 
OBVIOUSLY THE MFA RUSHED THE TEXT OVER TO THE 
PRESIDENCY AND TOP LEVEL MFA OFFICIALS MADE A 
POINT OF INFORMING THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE 
TEXT OF THE MESSAGE HAD BEEN FEATURED ON THE 
JULY 1 NATIONAL TV NEWS. 
 
4.  THE IRAQIS IN THE LAST FEW PAYS, HOWEVER, 
HAVE ALSO SIGNALED, IN PREDICTABLE TERMS, THAT 
THEY WILL NOT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE PERCEIVED 
AS PASSIVELY SUBMITTING TO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT 
AND PARTY LEADERSHIP REGARD AS AN ANTI-IRAQI 
\"CAMPAIGN\" BY WHAT THEY CALL \"CERTAIN 
ELEMENTS\" IN THE USG.  THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE OF 
THIS WAS THE FORTHRIGHT STATEMENT BY THE 
MINISTER OF TRADE (RESPONSIBLE FOR CCC AFFAIRS) 
TO CONGRESSMAN NIELSON JULY 1, THAT AS A RESULT 
OF SUSPENSION OF CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES (FOR 
REASONS THE GOI BELIEVES REFLECT UNJUSTIFIED 
HOSTILITY TOWARD IRAQ), THE GOI WILL BUY 
NO APT NO AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. 
(THAT SAME EVENING, THE WHOLE DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
GOT THE MESSAGE WHEN THE IRAQI MINISTER OF 
AGRICULTURE WAS DESPATCHED AS THE PRESIDENT\'S 
REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CANADIAN NATIONAL DAY 
RECEPTION.) 
 
5.  THIS IRAQI DECISION IS NOT RPT NOT REGARDED 
LOCALLY AS \"SANCTIONS\" AGAINST AMERICAN PRODUCTS. 
SADDAM EXPLAINED TO ABC TV LAST WEEK THAT IRAQ 
WOULD NOT INITIATE ECONOMIC WARFARE OF THIS 
KIND.  RATHER, THE IRAQIS SEE THEIR DECISION AS 
A RETALIATION TO A SANCTION TAKEN AGAINST THEM. 
SUCH A DECISION BY BAGHDAD WAS PREDICTABLE; 
THAT THE IRAQIS POSTPONED RETALIATION FOR SO 
LONG, AND EVEN RECEIVED AN AMERICAN INVESTIGATING 
TEAM FROM USDA, IS THE ONLY CURIOUS PART OF 
THE AFFAIR.  THAT THE DECISION IS SO LONG IN 
COMING, AND THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN PROMULGATED, 
ARE FURTHER SIGNALS THAT IRAQ HOPES FOR BETTER 
BILATERAL RELATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD. 
 
6.  NOTE:  FOR THE RECORD, ON THE MORNING OF 
JULY 2 DEPUTY FONMIN HAMDUN INFORMED THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT, ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENCY, 
AFP WAS RUNNING A STORY ON ITS WIRE THAT A 
PRESS SPOKESMAN WITH PRESIDENT BUSH HAD DENIED 
THAT \'ID GREETINGS HAD BEEN SENT TO IRAQ.  THE 
DEPUTY MINISTER SAID HE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO GO TO 
THE FOREIGN MINISTRY (TOTALLY EMPTY ON THIS 
MUSLIM \"CHRISTMAS DAY\") AND STAY THERE UNTIL 
THE ISSUE WAS SORTED OUT.  THE DEPUTY MINISTER 
EMPHASIZED THAT A DECISION HAVING BEEN TAKEN 
(BY SADDAM) TO REACH OUT TO US (BY GIVING 
PRESIDENT BUSH\'S GREETINGS TOP BILLING OVER ALL 
MUSLIN AND NON-MUSLIM CHIEFS OF STATE), THERE 
WAS CONSTERNATION AT THE IRAQI PRESIDENCY. 
 
7.  SUBSEQUENTLY, WE WERE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT 
THE AFP STORY HAD BEEN AN AFP MISTAKE (POPE/GLASPIE 
TELECON 7/2/90).

COMPLAINED ABOUT \"DISTORTION\" IN THE ABC VERSION 
OF PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN\'S INTERVIEW WITH 
DIANE SAWYER.  IT HAS PUBLISHED BOTH THE THREE- 
HOUR \"UNCUT\" VERSION AND WHAT IT CLAIMS IS THE 
TEXT OF THE 20-MINUTE ABC PROGRAM. 
ONCE AGAIN, SADDAM HAS FOUND \"EVIDENCE\" OF A U.S. 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM, YET HE IS SOLDIERING ON IN 
HIS NEW POLICY OF AVAILABILITY TO THE WESTERN 
PRESS (LE  FIGARO IS NEXT) AND IN HIS WILLING- 
NESS TO LET THE IRAQI PUBLIC SEE AND HEAR HIM

3.  FOLLOWING THE MEDIA HEADLINES GIVEN TO 
PRESIDENT BUSH\'S \'ID AL-ADHA MESSAGE TO IRAQI 
PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN (REF A) AND SADDAM\'S 
CORDIAL REPLY (HIGHLIGHTED IN JULY 6 NEWSPAPERS), 
IRAQ\'S GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED ARABIC PRESS LET OUT 
A HOWL OF FRUSTRATION JULY 7 AT ABC AND DIANE 
SAWYER FOR AIRING ONLY A SMALL \"DISTORTED\" 
PORTION OF SADDAM\'S JUNE 24 THREE-HOUR PLUS 
INTERVIEW WITH SAWYER.  \"DELIBERATE DISTORTION 
IN CONVERSATION OF THE LEADER WITH AMERICAN TV 
NETWORK:  THIS IS THE SPURIOUS DEMOCRACY OF THE 
AMERICANS.\"  THE ARTICLE ACCOMPANYING THE HEAD- 
LINES DEVELOPS THESE THEMES AND INVITES READERS 
TO COMPARE WHAT ABC AIRED (TEXT PRINTED JULY 7) 
WITH TEXT OF THE FULL INTERVIEW  (PUBLISHED 
JUNE 30), TO SEE JUST HOW DISTORTED U.S. REPORT- 
ING ON IRAQ IS. 
 
4.  U/S HAMDUN MADE THE SAME COMPLAINT ABOUT 
\"DISTORTION\" TO US PRIVATELY, THOUGH IN MORE 
TEMPERATE TERMS, ON JUNE 30.  WHEN WE POINTED 
OUT THAT COMPRESSING 3 HOURS INTO 20 MINUTES 
WOULD UNAVOIDABLY REMOVE SOME OF THE CONTEXT 
OF SPECIFIC REMARKS, HAMDUN SAID HE MEANT THERE 
WAS DELIBERATE AND NEGATIVE DISTORTION (HE HAD 
SEEN THE ABC VERSION). 
 
5.  COMMENT:  CLEARLY, THE ABC INCIDENT HAS 
FUELLED SADDAM\'S BELIEF THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA 
ARE ENGAGED IN AN ANTI-IRAQ CAMPAIGN--EDITORIALS 
ARE ALREADY MAKING THAT POINT--AND ADD TO THE 
SENSE THAT IRAQ WILL NOT GET A \"FAIR\" HEARING 
IN THE WEST.  NEVERTHELESS, SADDAM IS NOT THROWING 
IN THE TOWEL; HE IS EXPECTED TO GRANT AN 
INTERVIEW TO  LE FIGARO THIS WEEK, AND 40 MORE 
EUROPEAN (AND ONE JAPANESE) JOURNALISTS HAVE 
SENT IN THEIR REQUESTS. 
 
6.  IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE 
THE IRAQIS REACTED TO THE \"DISTORTION\" BY 
RUNNING SIX HOURS OF SADDAM\'S INTERVIEWS BUT HAVE 
PRINTED WHAT WAS AIRED BY ABC, INCLUDING MATERIAL 
THAT WAS EXCISED FROM THE VERSION OF THE INTER- 
VIEW AS BROADCAST HERE.  THE JULY 7 ARABIC 
PRESS TRANSCRIPTS OF THAT INTERVIEW CONTAIN, FOR 
EXAMPLE, SADDAM\'S DENIAL THAT HE EVER KILLED 
ANYONE AND HIS EXCHANGE WITH SAWYER ABOUT PUNISH- 
MENT FOR THOSE WHO INSULT THE PRESIDENT.  BUT, 
AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR TO 
EVERYONE THAT SADDAM HUSAYN IS FEELING COMFORT- 
ABLE AND CONFIDENT:  HE PERMITTED ALL IRAQIS 
TO READ AND SEE HIS INTERVIEWS, DEMONSTRATING 
THAT HE DOES NOT MIND APPEARING BEFORE THEM AS 
LESS THAN IMPECCABLE. 
 
7.  ACTION REQUESTED.  WE ARE MOST KEEN TO SEE

ORDER TO COMPARE IT WITH THE TWO VERSIONS 
PUBLISHED HERE.

SUBJECT: SADDAM\'S MESSAGE OF FRIENDSHIP TO PRESIDENT BUSH 
 
1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY: SADDAM TOLD THE AMBASSADOR JULY 25 
THAT MUBARAK HAS ARRANGED FOR KUWAITI AND IRAQI 
DELEGATIONS TO MEET IN RIYADH, AND THEN ON 
JULY 28, 29 OR 30, THE KUWAITI CROWN PRINCE WILL 
COME TO BAGHDAD FOR SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS. \"NOTHING 
WILL HAPPEN\" BEFORE THEN, SADDAM HAD PROMISED 
MUBARAK. 
 
--SADDAM WISHED TO CONVEY AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO 
PRESIDENT BUSH: IRAQ WANTS FRIENDSHIP, BUT DOES 
THE USG? IRAQ SUFFERED 100,000\'S OF CASUALTIES 
AND IS NOW SO POOR THAT WAR ORPHAN PENSIONS WILL 
SOON BE CUT; YET RICH KUWAIT WILL NOT EVEN ACCEPT 
OPEC DISCIPLINE. IRAQ IS SICK OF WAR, BUT KUWAIT 
HAS IGNORED DIPLOMACY. USG MANEUVERS WITH THE UAE 
WILL ENCOURAGE THE UAE AND KUWAIT TO IGNORE 
CONVENTIONAL DIPLOMACY. IF IRAQ IS PUBLICLY 
HUMILIATED BY THE USG, IT WILL HAVE NO CHOICE 
BUT TO \"RESPOND,\" HOWEVER ILLOGICAL AND SELF 
DESTRUCTIVE THAT WOULD PROVE. 
 
--ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE EXPLICIT, SADDAM\'S MESSAGE 
TO US SEEMED TO BE THAT HE WILL MAKE A MAJOR PUSH 
TO COOPERATE WITH MUBARAK\'S DIPLOMACY, BUT WE MUST 
TRY TO UNDERSTAND KUWAITI/UAE \"SELFISHNESS\" IS 
UNBEARABLE. AMBASSADOR MADE CLEAR THAT WE CAN 
NEVER EXCUSE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY OTHER THAN 
PEACEFUL MEANS. END SUMMARY. 
 
3. AMBASSADOR WAS SUMMONED BY PRESIDENT 
SADDAM HUSAYN AT NOON JULY 25. ALSO PRESENT 
WERE FONMIN AZIZ, THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE 
DIRECTOR, TWO NOTETAKERS, AND THE IRAQI 
INTERPRETER. 
 
4. SADDAM, WHOSE MANNER WAS CORDIAL, 
REASONABLE AND EVEN WARM THROUGHOUT THE ENSUING 
TWO HOURS, SAID HE WISHED THE AMBASSADOR TO 
CONVEY A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT BUSH. SADDAM 
THEN RECALLED IN DETAIL THE HISTORY OF IRAQ\'S 
DECISION TO REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
AND ITS POSTPONING IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT 
DECISION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR, RATHER THAN BE 
THOUGHT WEAK AND NEEDY. HE THEN SPOKE ABOUT THE 
MANY \"BLOWS\" OUR RELATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO 
SINCE 1984, CHIEF AMONG THEM IRANGATE. IT WAS 
AFTER THE FAW VICTORY, SADDAM SAID, THAT IRAQI 
MISAPPREHENSIONS ABOUT USG PURPOSES BEGAN TO 
SURFACE AGAIN, I.E., SUSPICIONS THAT THE U.S. WAS 
NOT HAPPY TO SEE THE WAR END. 
 
5. PICKING HIS WORDS WITH CARE, SADDAM SAID 
THAT THERE ARE \"SOME CIRCLES\" IN THE USG, 
INCLUDING IN CIA AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT, 
BUT EMPHATICALLY EXCLUDING THE PRESIDENT AND 
SECRETARY BAKER, WHO ARE NOT FRIENDLY TOWARD 
IRAQ-U.S. RELATIONS. HE THEN LISTED WHAT HE 
SEEMED TO REGARD AS FACTS TO SUPPORT THIS 
CONCLUSION: \"SOME CIRCLES ARE GATHERING 
INFORMATION ON WHO MIGHT BE SADDAM HUSAYN\'S 
SUCCESSOR;\" THEY KEPT UP CONTACTS IN THE GULF 
WARNING AGAINST IRAQ; THEY WORKED TO ENSURE 
NO HELP WOULD GO TO IRAQ (READ EXIM AND CCC). 
 
6. IRAQ, THE PRESIDENT STRESSED, IS IN SERIOUS 
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WITH 40 BILLION USD DEBTS. 
IRAQ, WHOSE VICTORY IN THE WAR AGAINST IRAN 
MADE AN HISTORIC DIFFERENCE TO THE ARAB WORLD 
AND THE WEST, NEEDS A MARSHALL PLAN. BUT \"YOU 
WANT THE OIL PRICE DOWN,\" SADDAM CHARGED. 
 
7. RESUMING HIS LIST OF GRIEVANCES WHICH HE 
BELIEVED WERE ALL INSPIRED BY 
\"SOME CIRCLES\" IN THE USG, HE RECALLED THE 
\"USIA CAMPAIGN\" AGAINST HIMSELF, AND THE 
GENERAL MEDIA ASSAULT ON IRAQ AND ITS PRESIDENT. 
 
8. DESPITE ALL THESE BLOWS, SADDAM SAID, AND 
ALTHOUGH \"WE WERE SOMEWHAT ANNOYED,\" WE STILL 
HOPED THAT WE COULD DEVELOP A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 
BUT THOSE WHO FORCE OIL PRICES DOWN ARE ENGAGING 
IN ECONOMIC WARFARE AND IRAQ CANNOT ACCEPT SUCH 
A TRESPASS ON ITS DIGNITY AND PROSPERITY. 
 
9. THE SPEARHEADS (FOR THE USG) HAVE BEEN KUWAIT 
AND THE UAE, SADDAM SAID. SADDAM SAID CAREFULLY 
THAT JUST AS IRAQ WILL NOT THREATEN OTHERS, IT 
WILL ACCEPT NO THREAT AGAINST ITSELF. \"WE HOPE 
THE USG WILL NOT MISUNDERSTAND:\" IRAQ ACCEPTS, 
AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN SAID, THAT ANY 
COUNTRY MAY CHOOSE ITS FRIENDS. BUT THE USG KNOWS 
THAT IT WAS IRAQ, NOT THE USG, WHICH DECISIVELY 
PROTECTED THOSE USG FRIENDS DURING THE WAR--AND THAT 
IS UNDERSTANDABLE SINCE PUBLIC OPINION IN THE USG, 
TO SAY NOTHING OF GEOGRAPHY, WOULD HAVE MADE IT 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE AMERICANS TO ACCEPT 10,000 DEAD 
IN A SINGLE BATTLE, AS IRAQ DID. 
 
10. SADDAM ASKED WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE USG 
TO ANNOUNCE IT IS COMMITTED TO THE DEFENSE OF 
ITS FRIENDS, INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY. 
ANSWERING HIS OWN QUESTION, HE SAID THAT TO IRAQ 
IT MEANS FLAGRANT BIAS AGAINST THE GOI. 
 
11. COMING TO ONE OF HIS MAIN POINTS, SADDAM 
ARGUED THAT USG MANEUVERS WITH THE UAE AND KUWAIT (SIC) 
ENCOURAGED THEM IN THEIR UNGENEROUS POLICIES. THE 
IRAQI RIGHTS, SADDAM EMPHASIZED, WILL BE RESTORED 
ONE BY ONE, THOUGH IT MAY TAKE A MONTH OR MUCH 
MORE THAN A YEAR. IRAQ HOPES THE USG WILL BE 
IN HARMONY WITH ALL THE PARTIES TO THIS DISPUTE. 
 
12. SADDAM SAID HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE USG IS 
DETERMINED TO KEEP THE OIL FLOWING AND TO 
MAINTAIN ITS FRIENDSHIPS IN THE GULF. WHAT HE 
CANNOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY WE ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO 
ARE DAMAGING IRAQ, WHICH IS WHAT OUR GULF MANEUVERS 
WILL DO. 
 
13. SADDAM SAID HE FULLY BELIEVES THE USG WANTS 
PEACE, AND THAT IS GOOD. BUT DO NOT, HE ASKED, 
USE METHODS WHICH YOU SAY YOU DO NOT LIKE, 
METHODS LIKE ARM-TWISTING- 
 
14. AT THIS POINT SADDAM SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT 
PRIDE OF IRAQIS, WHO BELIEVE IN \"LIBERTY OR DEATH.\" 
IRAQ WILL HAVE TO RESPOND IF THE U.S. USES THESE 
METHODS. IRAQ KNOWS THE USG CAN SEND PLANES AND 
ROCKETS AND HURT IRAQ DEEPLY. SADDAM ASKS THAT 
THE USG NOT FORCE IRAQ TO THE POINT OF HUMILIATION 
AT WHICH LOGIC MUST BE DISREGARDED. IRAQ DOES NOT 
CONSIDER THE U.S. AN ENEMY AND HAS TRIED TO BE 
FRIENDS. 
 
15. AS FOR THE INTRA-ARAB DISPUTES, SADDAM SAID 
HE IS NOT ASKING THE USG TO TAKE UP ANY PARTICULAR 
ROLE SINCE THE SOLUTIONS MUST COME THROUGH ARAB 
AND BILATERAL DIPLOMACY. 
 
16. RETURNING TO HIS THEME THAT IRAQ WANTS 
DIGNITY AND FREEDOM AS WELL AS FRIENDSHIP WITH THE 
U.S., HE CHARGED THAT IN THE LAST YEAR THERE WERE 
MANY OFFICIAL STATEMENTS WHICH MADE IT SEEM THAT 
THE U.S. DOES NOT WANT TO RECIPROCATE. HOW, FOR 
EXAMPLE, SADDAM ASKED,CAN WE INTERPRET THE 
INVITATION FOR ARENS TO VISIT AT A TIME OF CRISIS 
IN THE GULF? WHY DID THE U.S- DEFENSE MINISTER 
MAKE \"INFLAMMATORY\" STATEMENTS? 
 
17. SADDAM SAID THAT THE IRAQIS KNOW WHAT 
WAR IS, WANT NO MORE OF IT--\"DO NOT PUSH US TO IT; 
DO NOT MAKE IT THE ONLY OPTION LEFT WITH WHICH WE 
CAN PROTECT OUR DIGNITY.\" 
 
18. PRESIDENT BUSH, SADDAM SAID, HAS MADE NO MISTAKE 
IN HIS PRESIDENCY VIS-A-VIS THE ARABS. THE DECISION 
ON THE PLO DIALOGUE WAS \"MISTAKEN,\" BUT IT WAS 
TAKEN UNDER \"ZIONIST PRESSURE\" AND, SADDAM SAID, IS 
PERHAPS A CLEVER TACTIC TO ABSORB THAT PRESSURE. 
 
19. AFTER A SHORT DIVERSION ON THE NEED FOR THE 
U.S. TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF 200,000 
ARABS WITH THE SAME VIGOR AND INTEREST AS THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS OF THE ISRAELIS, SADDAM CONCLUDED BY 
RESTATING THAT IRAQ WANTS AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP 
\"ALTHOUGH WE WILL NOT PANT FOR IT, WE WILL DO OUR 
PART AS FRIENDS.\" 
 
20. SADDAM THEN OFFERED AN ANECDOTE TO ILLUSTRATE 
HIS POINT. HE HAD TOLD THE IRAQI KURDISH LEADER 
IN 1974 THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO GIVE UP HALF OF 
THE SHATT AL-ARAB TO IRAN TO OBTAIN ALL OF A 
PROSPEROUS IRAQ. THE KURD HAD BET THAT SADDAM WOULD 
NOT GIVE HALF THE SHATT--THE KURD WAS WRONG. EVEN 
NOW, THE ONLY REAL ISSUE WITH IRAN IS THE SHATT, AND 
IF GIVING AWAY HALF OF THE WATERWAY IS THE ONLY 
THING STANDING BETWEEN THE CURRENT SITUATION AND 
IRAQI PROSPERITY, SADDAM SAID HE WOULD BE GUIDED 
BY WHAT HE DID IN 1974. 
 
21. THE AMBASSADOR THANKED SADDAM FOR THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS DIRECTLY WITH HIM SOME OF 
HIS AND OUR CONCERNS. PRESIDENT BUSH, TOO, WANTS 
FRIENDSHIP, AS HE HAD WRITTEN AT THE \'ID AND ON 
THE OCCASION OF IRAQ\'S NATIONAL DAY. SADDAM 
INTERRUPTED TO SAY HE HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THOSE 
 
22. AMBASSADOR RESUMED HER THEME, RECALLING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAD INSTRUCTED HER TO BROADEN AND 
DEEPEN OUR RELATIONS WITH IRAQ. SADDAM HAD REFERRED 
TO \"SOME CIRCLES\" ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT AIM. SUCH 
CIRCLES CERTAINLY EXISTED, BUT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION 
IS INSTRUCTED BY THE PRESIDENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, 
THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT CONTROL THE AMERICAN PRESS; 
IF HE DID, CRITICISM OF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT 
EXIST. SADDAM AGAIN INTERRUPTED TO SAY HE UNDERSTOOD 
THAT. THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE HAD SEEN THE DIANE 
SAWYER SHOW AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS CHEP AND UNFAIR. 
BUT THE AMERICAN PRESS TREATS ALL POLITICIANS 
WITHOUT KID GLOVES--THAT IS OUR WAY. 
 
23. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
VERY RECENTLY REAFFIRMED HIS DESIRE FOR A BETTER 
RELATIONSHIP AND HAS PROVEN THAT BY, FOR EXAMPLE, 
OPPOSING SANCTIONS BILLS. HERE SADDAM INTERRUPTED 
AGAIN. LAUGHING, HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING LEFT 
FOR IRAQ TO BUY IN THE U.S. EVERYTHING IS 
PROHIBITED EXCEPT FOR WHEAT, AND NO DOUBT THAT WILL 
SOON BE DECLARED A DUAL-USE ITEM- SADDAM SAID, HOWEVER, 
HE HAD DECIDED NOT TO RAISE THIS ISSUE, BUT RATHER 
CONCENTRATE ON THE FAR MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES AT HAND. 
 
24. AMBASSADOR SAID THERE WERE MANY ISSUES HE 
HAD RAISED SHE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON, BUT 
SHE WISHED TO USE HER LIMITED TIME WITH THE 
PRESIDENT TO STRESS FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH\'S DESIRE 
FOR FRIENDSHIP AND, SECOND, HIS STRONG DESIRE, SHARED 
WE ASSUME BY IRAQ, FOR PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE MID 
EAST. IS IT NOT REASONABLE FOR US TO BE CONCERNED 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER BOTH 
SAY PUBLICLY THAT KUWAITI ACTIONS ARE THE 
EQUIVALENT OF MILITARY AGGRESSION, AND THEN WE 
LEARN THAT MANY UNITS OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD 
HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE BORDER? IS IT NOT REASONABLE 
FOR US TO ASK, IN THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP, NOT 
CONFRONTATION, THE SIMPLE QUESTION: WHAT ARE YOUR 
INTENTIONS? 
 
25. SADDAM SAID THAT WAS INDEED A REASONABLE 
QUESTION. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE SHOULD BE 
CONCERNED FOR REGIONAL PEACE, IN FACT IT IS OUR 
DUTY AS A SUPERPOWER. \"BUT HOW CAN WE MAKE THEM 
(KUWAIT AND UAE) UNDERSTAND HOW DEEPLY WE ARE 
SUFFERING.\" THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IS SUCH THAT 
THE PENSIONS FOR WIDOWS AND ORPHANS WILL HAVE 
TO BE CUT. AT THIS POINT, THE INTERPRETER AND 
ONE OF THE NOTETAKERS BROKE DOWN AND WEPT. 
 
26. AFTER A PAUSE FOR RECUPERATION, SADDAM SAID, 
IN EFFECT, BELIEVE ME I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING: WE 
SENT ENVOYS, WROTE MESSAGES, ASKED FAHD TO 
ARRANGE QUADRAPARTITE SUMMIT (IRAQ, SAG, UE, 
KUWAIT). FAHD SUGGESTFD OIL MINISTERS INSTEAD AND 
WE AGREED TO THE JEDDAH AGREEMENT ALTHOUGH IT WAS 
WELL BELOW OUR HOPES. THEN, SADDAM CONTINUED, 
TWO DAYS LATER THE KUWAITI OIL MINISTER ANNOUNCED 
HE WOULD WANT TO ANNUL THAT AGREEMENT WITHIN TWO 
MONTHS. AS FOR THE UAE, SADDAM SAID, I BEGGED 
SHAYKH ZAYID TO UNDERSTAND OUR PROBLEMS (WHEN 
SADDAM ENTERTAINED HIM IN MOSUL AFTER THE BAGHDAD 
SUMMIT), AND ZAYID SAID JUST WAIT UNTIL I GET 
BACK TO ABU DHABI. BUT THEN HIS MINISTER OF OIL 
MADE \"BAD STATEMENTS.\" 
 
27. AT THIS POINT, SADDAM LEFT THE ROOM TO TAKE 
AN URGENT CALL FROM MUBARAK. AFTER HIS RETURN, 
THE AMBASSADOR ASKED IF HE COULD TELL HER IF 
THERE HAS ANY PROGRESS IN FINDING A PEACEFUL WAY 
TO DEFUSE THE DISPUTE. THIS WAS SOMETHING PRESIDENT 
BUSH WOULD BE KEENLY INTERESTED TO KNOW. SADDAM 
SAID THAT HE HAD JUST LEARNED FROM MUBARAK THE 
KUWAITIS HAVE AGREED TO NEGOTIATE. THE KUWAITI 
CROWN PRINCE/PRIME MINISTER WOULD MEET IN RIYADH 
WITH SADDAM\'S NUMBER TWO, IZZAT IBRAHIM, AND THEN 
THE KUWAITI WOULD COME TO BAGHDAD ON SATURDAY, 
SUNDAY OR, AT THE LATEST, MONDAY, JULY 30. 
 
28. \"I TOLD MUBARAK,\" SADDAM SAID, THAT \"NOTHING 
WILL HAPPEN UNTIL THE MEETING,\" AND NOTHING WILL 
HAPPEN DURING OR AFTER THE MEETING IF THE KUWAITIS 
WILL AT LAST \"GIVE US SOME HOPE.\" 
 
29. THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR 
THIS GOOD NEWS. SADDAM THEN ASKED HER TO CONVEY 
HIS WARM GREETINGS TO PRESIDENT BUSH AND TO 
CONVEY HIS MESSAGE TO HIM. 
 
30. NOTE: ON THE BORDER QUESTION, SADDAM REFERRED 
TO THE 1961 AGREEMENT AND A \"LINE OF PATROL\" IT 
HAD ESTABLISHED. THE KUWAITIS, HE SAID, HAD TOLD 
MUBARAK IRAQ WAS 20 KILOMETERS \"IN FRONT\" OF THIS 
LINE. THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT SHE HAD SERVED IN 
KUWAIT 20 YEARS BEFORE; THEN, AS NOW, WE TOOK NO 
POSITION ON THESE ARAB AFFAIRS. 
 
31. COMMENT: IN THE MEMORY QF THE CURRENT 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS, SADDAM HAS NEVER SUMMONED AN 
AMBASSADOR. HE IS WORRIED. 
 
ACCORDING TO HIS OWN POLITICAL THEORIZING 
(U.S. THE SOLE MAJOR POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST), 
HE NEEDS AT A MINIMUM A CORRECT RELATIONSHIP 
WITH US FOR OBVIOUS GEOPOLITICAL REASONS, 
ESPECIALLY AS LONG AS HE PERCEIVES MORTAL 
THREATS FROM ISRAEL AND IRAN. AMBASSADOR 
BELIEVES SADDAM SUSPECTS OUR DECISION SUDDENLY 
TO UNDERTAKE MANEUVERS WITH ABU DHABI IS A 
HARBINGER OF A USG DECISION TO TAKE SIDES. 
FURTHER, SADDAM, HIMSELF BEGINNING TO HAVE AN 
INKLING OF HOW MUCH HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT 
THE U.S., IS APPREHENSIVE THAT WE DO NOT 
UNDERSTAND CERTAIN POLITICAL FACTORS WHICH 
INHIBIT HIM, SUCH AS: 
 
--HE CANNOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE PERCEIVED AS 
CAVING IN TO SUPERPOWER BULLYING (AS U/S HAMDUN 
FRANKLY WARNED US IN LATE 1988); 
 
--IRAQ, WHICH LOST 100,000\'S OF CASUALTIES, IS 
SUFFERING AND KUWAIT IS \"MISERLY\" AND \"SELFISH.\" 
 
32. IT WAS PROGRESS TO HAVE SADDAM ADMIT 
THAT THE USG HAS A \"RESPONSIBILITY\" IN THE 
REGION, AND HAS EVERY RIGHT TO EXPECT AN 
ANSWER WHEN WE ASK IRAQ\'S INTENTIONS. HIS 
RESPONSE IN EFFECT THAT HE TRIED VARIOUS 
DIPLOMATIC/CHANNELS BEFORE RESORTING TO 
UNADULTERATED INTIMIDATION HAS AT LEAST THE 
VIRTUE OF FRANKNESS. HIS EMPHASIS THAT HE 
WANTS PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IS SURELY SINCERE 
(IRAQIS ARE SICK OF WAR), BUT THE TERMS SOUND 
DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. SADDAM SEEMS TO WANT 
PLEDGES NOW ON OIL PRICES AND PRODUCTION TO 
COVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS.

5.  WE REJECT ANY FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN THE

AGGRAVATE THE SITUATION.  IRAQ LOOKS FORWARD TO 
SEEING THE SITUATION RESTORED BACK TO NORMAL 
IN KUWAIT QUICKLY AND BY THE PEOPLE OF KUWAIT 
THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY FOREIGN INTERFERENCE.

THE HONORABLE COLIN POWELL 
SECRETARY OF STATE 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE 
WASHINGTON DC 
 
BAGHDAD 29TH JUNE 2004 
 
DEAR MR. SECRETARY.

SENTENCES FOR CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS 
 
REF: BAGHDAD 00001 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DCM JAMES JEFFREY FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
    1.  (C) SUMMARY.  SENIOR IRAQI INTERIM GOVERNMENT (IIG) 
OFFICIALS ARE MAKING CLEAR THAT THEY BELIEVE TOUGHER 
MEASURES NEED TO BE TAKEN TO DEFEAT VIOLENCE.  THEY HAVE 
BEEN CLEAR THAT TRANSPARENT RULE OF LAW PROCEDURES WOULD 
STILL APPLY.  THE ISSUE MAY BE MORE COMPLICATED IN THE 
FIELD.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) SENIOR IRAQI OFFICIALS HAVE MADE A PARTICULAR POINT 
OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE AWARE THEY INTEND TO TAKE A 
TOUGH LINE AGAINST VIOLENCE.  THIS WAS A THEME IN 
AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTEQS PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS 
(REFTEL) AS WELL AS IN FOREIGN MINISTER ZEBARIQS 
CONVERSATION JUNE 28 WITH SECRETARY OF DEFENSE RUMSFELD. 
 
3.  (C) FOREIGN MINISTER ZEBARI GAVE MORE DETAIL IN A JUNE 
28 DISCUSSION WITH POL/MIL COUNSELOR NEUMANN.  ZEBARI 
CHARACTERIZED THE THREAT AS BEING THREE FOLD; BAQATHISTS, 
TERRORISTS AND CRIMINALS.  HE SAID THE THIRD CATEGORY IS 
PROVIDING A LARGE BASE OF LOGISTICS SUPPORT TO THE 
TERRORISTS.  UP TO NOW THE COALITION HAS SUSPENDED THE 
DEATH PENALTY BUT IRAQ IS NOW SOVEREIGN; LEAVING THE 
IMPLICATION IT WILL BE RE-IMPOSED.  HE CONTINUED THAT 
IRAQIS ARE USED TO SEEING JUSTICE MORE DIRECTLY THAN THEY 
HAVE UNDER THE COALITION.  HE NOTED THAT IN MANY ARAB 
COUNTRIES IT IS NORMAL TO SEE TELEVISED CONFESSIONS, BUT 
THE CPA HAD NOT ALLOWED THIS.  ZEBARI ASSURED NEUMANN THAT 
REASONABLE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL NORMS WOULD CONTINUE TO 
PREVAIL WITH TRIALS AND OBSERVANCE OF LAWS.  HOWEVER, HE 
LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT TOUGHER MEASURES. 
 
4.  (C) WE ARE HEARING SOME TALK OF THE PRIME MINISTER 
IMPOSING A STATE OF EMERGENCY.  HIS OFFICE SEEMS TO BE 
RESEARCHING THIS WITH LAWYERS TO INSURE THAT IT IS 
CONSISTENT WITH NORMALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL PRINCIPLES.  BEFORE 
THE END OF CPA, ALLAWI WAS BRIEFED BY CPA LEGAL ON WHAT HE 
COULD AND COULD NOT DO IN THIS REGARD IN VIEW OF THE TAL 
AND OPERATIVE IRAQI LAW.  THE BOTTOM LINE POINT MADE TO HIM 
WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW DUE PROCESS STRICTLY, HAVE 
VALID JUSTIFICATION, AND FOR MOST ACTIONS HAVE TO PASS A 
LAW Q- NOT EASY CONSIDERING THE CONDITIONS THE IIG MUST 
OPERATE UNDER. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT.  THE IIG IS FIGHTING FOR ITS LIFE, 
LITERALLY IN THE CASE OF SECURITY FORCES AND OFFICIALS. 
THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE EXPLICITLY STATED THAT CHANGES 
WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ACCEPTED LEGAL NORMS.  WE HAVE NOT 
SIGNALED ANY DISAPPROVAL ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POINTEDLY ASKED 
ABOUT LEGAL NORMS AND RECEIVED THE ASSURANCES NOTED ABOVE. 
THE IIG KNOWS THAT IT HAS TO CONSULT WITH US ON 
CONSTRUCTING A STATE OF EMERGENCY LAW SINCE ITS ENFORCEMENT 
COULD INVOLVE COALITION FORCES.  AN EMERGENCY LAW USED TO 
STIFLE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT BE 
HELPFUL.  AN EMERGENCY LAW THAT RESTORES PUBLIC CONFIDENCE 
ON SECURITY WHILE ALSO ALLOWING FREE POLITICAL DEBATE AND 
COMPETITION WOULD BE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT.  A SEPARATE 
PROBLEM MAY BE TO EXPLAIN TO IRAQI SECURITY FORCES THAT 
BEING SOVEREIGN DOESNQT MEAN THEY CAN BEAT PRISONERS.  U.S. 
MILITARY PERSONNEL HAVE ALREADY INTERVENED TO STOP ONE 
SMALLISH INCIDENT BUT WE THINK OTHERS WILL BE LIKELY. 
ORDERS TO COALITION FORCES NOT TO ALLOW SUCH ACTIONS ARE 
CLEAR.  END COMMENT.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER ZEBARI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR JULY 4 
THAT THE NEW INTERIM IRAQI GOVERNMENT (IIG) MUST DEMONSTRATE ITS 
INDEPENDENCE AND SHOW THE IRAQI PEOPLE THAT THE TRANSFER OF 
POWER WAS GENUINE.  HE HOPED DISBURSEMENT OF U.S. SUPPLEMENTAL 
FUNDS WOULD BE ACCELERATED AND SAID THAT STABILITY AND SECURITY 
HAD IMPROVED IN AREAS WHERE SUPPLEMENTAL MONEY HAD ALREADY BEEN 
SPENT.  ZEBARI WAS PLEASED WITH HIS TRIP TO THE NATO SUMMIT IN 
ISTANBUL AND WELCOMED THE FINAL OUTCOME.  HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR 
THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAQ AND ITS NEIGHBORS WERE DIFFICULT, 
AND SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SYRIA AS 
PROBLEMATIC.  REGARDING ELECTIONS, ZEBARI ARGUED PROPORTIONAL 
REPRESENTATION WOULD BE QTHE SAVIORQ FOR IRAQ WHILE A WINNER- 
TAKE-ALL SYSTEM WOULD SOW THE SEEDS FOR CIVIL WAR.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TRANSFER OF SOVEREIGNTY 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (C) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE MET JULY 4 WITH FOREIGN MINISTER 
ZEBARI AS AN INITIAL COURTESY CALL.  ZEBARI WAS POSITIVE ABOUT 
THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND JOKED WITH THE AMBASSADOR THAT 
IF HE BELIEVED ONLY THE MEDIAQS INTERPRETATION OF THE STATE OF 
AFFAIRS, HE WOULD TRY TO QSEEK POLITICAL ASYLUMQ ABROAD.  THE 
MINISTER UNDERLINED THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVING TO THE IRAQI 
PEOPLE THAT THE TRANSFER OF SOVEREIGNTY WAS GENUINE AND 
CREDIBLE.  HE ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT IRAQ AND THE UNITED 
STATES WERE QON THE SAME TEAMQ BUT SAID THE IIG WOULD NEED TO 
SHOW ITS INDEPENDENCE. 
 
3.  (C) SADDAM HUSSEINQS ARRAIGNMENT WAS A SUCCESSFUL 
DEMONSTRATION OF LEADERSHIP BY THE IIG, ACCORDING TO ZEBARI.  HE 
SAID THAT ALTHOUGH SOME COLLEAGUES HAD RESERVATIONS THAT SADDAM 
WOULD USE THE OCCASION TO HIS ADVANTAGE, ZEBARI WAS CONVINCED 
THE HEARING HUMILIATED SADDAM AND \"SENT THE RIGHT MESSAGE\" TO 
THE IRAQI PUBLIC. 
 
4.  (C) REGARDING THE MEDIA, THE MINISTER SAID THE IIG WOULD 
NEED TO MANAGE \"ITS MESSAGE\" AND PUSH MORE OFFICIALS FORWARD TO 
SPEAK WITH THE PRESS.  ZEBARI SAID THAT IT WAS PREDOMINANTLY CPA 
OFFICIALS WHO INTERFACED WITH THE MEDIA FOR THE PAST YEAR.  THE 
AMBASSADOR AGREED WITH ZEBARI AND NOTED THAT HE HAD NOT ONCE 
SPOKEN TO THE PRESS IN THE PAST FIVE DAYS.  THE AMBASSADOR 
EMPHASIZED THAT THE USG WANTED TO TAKE A LOWER PROFILE AND 
SUPPORT THE NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT HOWEVER POSSIBLE.  THE 
AMBASSADOR OFFERED TRAINING FOR IRAQI PRESS OFFICERS.  ZEBARI 
WELCOMED THE OFFER. 
 
5.  (C) ZEBARI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HE WAS \"PUTTING THE 
FINAL TOUCHES\" ON HIS LIST OF 47 CHIEFS OF MISSION TO BE SENT 
ABROAD, INCLUDING TO WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK.  HE SAID THE LIST 
WOULD BE FINALIZED WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS. 
 
 
U.S. ASSISTANCE 
--------------- 
 
6.  (C) ZEBARI EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE SLOW PACE OF U.S. 
SUPPLEMENTAL FUND DISBURSEMENTS.  HE URGED THE AMBASSADOR TO 
QUICKEN THE PACE AND NOTED THAT IN AREAS WHERE THE USG HAD BEGUN 
PROJECTS, LIKE IN TIKRIT, THE SECURITY SITUATION HAD SHOWN 
MARKED IMPROVEMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD ZEBARI THAT A LARGER 
PERCENTAGE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL HAD ACTUALLY BEEN COMMITTED THAN 
THE MEDIA PORTRAYED, BUT HE AGREED WITH ZEBARI THAT FUNDS NEEDED 
TO FLOW AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
------------------------ 
 
7.  (C) ZEBARI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT HIS TRIP TO ISTANBUL FOR 
THE NATO SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS.  HE WAS PLEASED WITH HIS 
OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET OTHER FOREIGN AND DEFENSE MINISTERS TO 
CONVEY THE MESSAGE THAT IRAQ NEEDED SUPPORT, SPECIFICALLY 
TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT.  THE FRENCH DELEGATION HAD QUESTIONED 
ZEBARI AS TO HOW GENUINE AND REPRESENTATIONAL THE POLITICAL 
PROCESS IN IRAQ WAS.  THE MINISTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE 
WELCOMED THE FRENCH QUESTIONS AS IT GAVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
EXPLAIN THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY.  [NOTE: THE FRENCH 
CHARGE IN BAGHDAD HAS YET TO SUBMIT HIS CREDENTIALS.  HOWEVER, 
THE CHARGE ENCOURAGED ZEBARI TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE FRENCH 
FOREIGN MINISTER REQUESTING THAT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BE RE- 
ESTABLISHED.  HE SAID THE FRENCH SIDE WOULD RESPOND QUICKLY IN 
THE AFFIRMATIVE.  END NOTE.] 
 
8.  (C) ZEBARI HAD TRAVELED TO ISTANBUL ONE WEEK PRIOR TO THE 
NATO SUMMIT FOR AN ORGANIZATION OF ISLAMIC CONFERENCES (OIC) 
MEETING.  HE ALSO VIEWED THIS MEETING AS A SUCCESS AND WAS 
PLEASED WITH THE OIC FINAL RESOLUTION, WHICH SUPPORTED THE IIG 
AND UNSCR 1546.  DURING THE OIC MINISTERIAL, SRSG BRAHIMI SAID 
THE MEETING WAS GOOD AND HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE NEXT SUCH 
GATHERING, WHICH EGYPT PLANNED TO HOST IN LATE JULY. 
 
9.  (C) THE MINISTER CHARACTERIZED RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAQ AND 
ITS NEIGHBORS AS DIFFICULT.  ZEBARI SPECIFICALLY RAISED THE 
ISSUE OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS ENTERING IRAQ FROM SYRIA AND IRAN.  HE 
WOULD NOT ACCUSE EITHER GOVERNMENT OF AN OFFICIAL POLICY TO SEND 
FOREIGN FIGHTERS, BUT ZEBARI TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT BOTH 
DAMASCUS AND TEHRAN COULD CERTAINLY DO MORE TO STOP IT. 
 
10.  (C) WHENEVER ZEBARI RAISED THE ISSUE WITH HIS SYRIAN 
INTERLOCUTORS, THEY WOULD ASK ZEBARI FOR EVIDENCE OF SYRIAN 
INVOLVEMENT.  THE MINISTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT EVIDENCE 
EXISTED; SYRIAN MEDIA \"AGITATED\" THE SITUATION AND FOREIGN 
FIGHTERS WITH SYRIAN IDENTIFICATION PAPERS HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN 
IRAQ.  FURTHERMORE, ZEBARI REPORTED THAT FORMER IRAQ BAQATH 
PARTY MEMBERS AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS WERE IN SYRIA ORGANIZING 
ACTIVITIES TO UNDERMINE THE IIG.  ZEBARI SAID THE IIG WAS 
EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF CLOSING THE BORDER WITH SYRIA, BUT 
NOTED THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON IRAQ. 
 
11.  (C) ACCORDING TO ZEBARI, SAUDI ARABIA AND TO A LESSER 
EXTENT EGYPT WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THE SYRIAN POSITION.  ANOTHER 
ARAB FOREIGN MINISTER HAD TOLD ZEBARI THAT IRAQI FREEDOM 
QTERRIFIEDQ SYRIA, IRAN, AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. 
 
ELECTIONS 
--------- 
 
12.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD ZEBARI THAT UN OFFICIALS PLANNED TO 
RETURN TO IRAQ SHORTLY, BOTH TO HELP WITH THE NATIONAL 
CONFERENCE AND TO WORK ON ELECTION PREPARATIONS.  REGARDING 
ELECTIONS, ZEBARI ARGUED THAT PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WAS 
QTHE ONLY SAVIORQ FOR IRAQ.  PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WOULD 
LEAD TO NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND QVERY LIVELYQ ALLIANCES 
BETWEEN ETHNIC AND SECTARIAN GROUPS.  ZEBARI CONTINUED THAT A 
WINNER-TAKE-ALL SYSTEM WOULD LEAD TO LARGE POLITICAL BLOCS 
FORMING AND POSSIBLE CIVIL WAR.  HE SAID THAT IF THE SHIQA WON 
AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY THROUGH PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION Q \"SO 
BE IT.\"  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT SOME PEOPLE HAD EXPRESSED 
FEARS THAT PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WOULD LEAD TO ISLAMIC 
EXTREMIST DOMINATION.  ZEBARI DISCOUNTED THOSE FEARS. 
 
13.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED ZEBARI FOR SHARING HIS THOUGHTS 
ON ELECTIONS, AND AGREED THAT WHEN IRAQ DRAFTED ITS 
CONSTITUTION, IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE ALL VOICES, EVEN 
THOSE OF SMALL MINORITIES, TO BE HEARD.  A SYSTEM OF 
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION SHOULD ALLOW FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY.

SUBJECT:  USEB 039: IRAQI INTERIM GOVERNMENT DECREE ON THE 
DEFENSE OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY.  THE IRAQI INTERIM GOVERNMENT (IIG) ENACTED 
A DECREE ON THE DEFENSE OF NATIONAL SECURITY TODAY.  THE 
LAW IS AIMED AT BETTER COMBATING THE INSURGENCY WHILE 
MAINTAINING BASIC RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE LAW 
COMPLIES WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE TRANSITIONAL 
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW (TAL), WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO AN IRAQI 
BILL OF RIGHTS.  POST PROVIDES COMMENTS ON THE LAW AND THE 
FULL TEXT OF THE LAW BELOW.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) ON WEDNESDAY, JULY 7, 2004, THE IRAQI INTERIM 
GOVERNMENT PASSED A DECREE ON THE DEFENSE OF NATIONAL 
SECURITY.  POST\'S VIEW IS THAT THE LAW IS NOT DESIGNED TO 
GRANT THE IIG VAST ADDITIONAL POWERS.  TO THE CONTRARY, 
MOST OF WHAT THE DRAFT PERMITS COULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN DONE 
UNDER EXISTING IRAQI LAW.  THE DRAFT SERVES AS AN OMNIBUS 
ORDER, CONSOLIDATING IRAQI PROCEDURES WITHIN A RULE OF LAW 
FRAMEWORK FOR READY USE IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.  THE 
IIG AS SOON AS IT WAS FORMED SIGNALED AN INTEREST IN SUCH 
AN ACT TO WORK WITH CPA AND US TO ENDEAVOR THAT THE FINAL 
DRAFT COMPORTED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS UNDER BOTH THE 
TAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.  POST VIEWS THE OUTCOME AS 
FAVORABLE.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LAW FOLLOW IN PARAGRAPH 3 AND 
THE FULL TEXT OF THE LAW AS TRANSLATED BY THE U.S. EMBASSY 
IS IN PARAGRAPH 4. 
 
3. (U) HIGHLIGHTS. 
 
-- THE DECREE IS NOT SELF-EXECUTING.  BOTH THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENCY (UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THREE 
PERSONS) MUST DECLARE AN EMERGENCY CONDITION FOR THE DECREE 
TO HAVE EFFECT. 
 
-- THE DEFINITION OF \"EMERGENCY CONDITION\" LIMITS 
APPLICATION TO A CONTINUOUS, SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE 
IN A PARTICULAR PART OF IRAQ THAT THREATENS THE PERSONAL 
SAFETY OF IRAQIS.  AN EMERGENCY CONDITION DOES NOT 
AUTOMATICALLY APPLY NATIONWIDE. 
 
-- ANY DECLARED EMERGENCY CONDITION AUTOMATICALLY SUNSETS 
AFTER 60 DAYS AND EVERY 30 DAYS THEREAFTER UNLESS 
REAFFIRMED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENCY. 
 
-- ALL SEARCHES AND SEIZURES MUST COMPORT WITH THE TAL AND 
THUS REQUIRE JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION IN THE ABSENCE OF 
EXTREME EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES. 
 
-- ALL DETAINEES MUST BE BROUGHT BEFORE A JUDGE WITHIN 24 
HOURS, CONSISTENT WITH THE IRAQI CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. 
 
-- ALL EXECUTIVE DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE DECISION TO 
DECLARE AN EMERGENCY, ARE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW AND 
OVERSIGHT BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL. 
 
-- TO THE EXTENT NEW POWERS OR PROCEDURES ARE AUTHORIZED, 
THEY APPLY ONLY IN AREAS OF A DECLARED EMERGENCY AND EXPIRE 
AFTER THE EMERGENCY. 
 
SUCH NEW POWERS AND PROCEDURES INCLUDE: 
 
-- LIMITED CONTROLS ON MOVEMENT, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, AND 
EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION TO ORDER CURFEWS FOR A FIXED PERIOD 
OF TIME. 
 
-- CLOSING OR RESTRICTING ACTIVITIES OF PRIVATE 
ORGANIZATIONS, UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS, AFTER OBTAINING A 
COURT ORDER. 
 
-- ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN COVERT SURVEILLANCE MEASURES UPON 
JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION. 

-- ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIFIED CHAIN OF COMMAND FOR IRAQI 
SECURITY FORCES, ALL OF WHOM WILL REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE 
PRIME MINISTER OR HIS DESIGNEE. 
 
-- BROAD POWER TO DELEGATE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY FROM THE 
PRIME MINISTER TO CIVILIAN OR MILITARY OFFICIALS WHERE 
NECESSARY. 
 
-- AUTHORITY TO ORDER THE ISOLATION AND ENCIRCLEMENT OF 
AREAS EXPERIENCING WIDESPREAD INSURRECTION. 
 
-- AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE PRIME MINISTER, WITH PRESIDENCY 
APPROVAL, TO GRANT PARDONS AND IMMUNITY. 
 
THE FORMER REGIME HAD SUCH POWERS BUT THEY WERE NOT 
ESTABLISHED IN WRITING, THEY WERE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES, 
AND THEY WERE SUBJECT TO ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT. 
 
-- THE DECREE REAFFIRMS THE IIG\'S COMMITMENT TO CARRYING 
OUT ELECTIONS BY JANUARY 1995, SAYING \"IT IS NOT 
PERMISSIBLE TO USE ANY PROVISIONS OF THIS ORDER TO DELAY 
... 
IONS UNDER 1546, 
OR IRAQI SECURITY FORCES OPERATING UNDER UNIFIED MNF-I 
COMMAND.

TAGS: PGOV, PINS, KISL, IZ 
SUBJECT: USEB 58: Shia Leaders Petition on Behalf of Sadr 
 
1. (U) Classified by DCM James Jeffrey, Reason 1.4 (B) and 
(D). 
 
2. (C) Summary:  Last week, influential Shia leaders, 
including the Dawa and SCIRI parties, asked Prime Minister 
Allawi to defuse the tension in Najaf by dropping, at least 
temporarily, the charges against Muqtada al-Sadr.  They 
told Allawi it would be preferable for Sadr\'s militia, the 
Jaysh Al Mahdi(JAM), to become a political movement.  A 
senior IIG official said Allawi\'s initial reaction was 
skeptical but said the Prime Minister might be convinced to 
be more accommodating with Sadr and his unruly militia. 
End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
TOP SHIA POLITICIANS PLEAD FOR SADR 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) IIG National Security Advisor Moaffak Al-Rubaie told 
MNF-I LT. General McColl, and Embassy POLMIL and POL 
Counselors on July 7 that thirteen members of what he 
called the \"Shia Caucus\" (in Arabic, \"Bayt Shia\" or \"Shia 
House\") delivered a letter about defusing the problem with 
Muqtada al-Sadr to Prime Minister Allawi earlier this week. 
The thirteen included representatives from the Dawa party 
and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, 
as well as the Badr Corps.  Former Governing Council 
members Ahmed al-Barak and Mohammed Bahr al-Aloum were also 
in the group, he said.  Al-Rubaie gave PolCouns a few 
minutes to read the signed Arabic letter (but wouldn\'t let 
us have a copy). 
 
4. (C) The letter opened with the petitioners\' referring to 
a recent letter from al-Sadr to the Bayt Shia asking for 
their help in defusing the problems between him and the 
IIG.  It said the Bayt Shia wanted to build on the work of 
the Joint Coordination Committee now established between 
the Najaf governor and the Office of the Martyr Sadr in 
Najaf.  The petitioners said they hoped the IIG would 
support the Bayt Shia\'s effort to move from a ceasefire in 
Najaf and Kufa to a period of \"accord\" (\"ittifaq\" in 
Arabic). 
 
They proposed four steps: 
 
-- Prime Minister Allawi would personally engage to help 
solve the problem with Muqtada al-Sadr. 
 
-- Armed men in the two holy cities of Najaf and Kufa would 
agree to leave and go home.  (Comment: To Baghdad\'s Sadr 
City and elsewhere in Iraq.  End comment.)  They would 
thereby agree to end their occupation of mosques, religious 
schools and shrines, and government buildings.  In 
addition, all sides would agree to cancel Sadr\'s Shari\'a 
court rulings over an agreed period. 
 
-- The IIG would agree to suspend (\"taaleeq\") the legal 
case against Muqtada al-Sadr until the coming (\"inbithaq\") 
of an elected government in Iraq. 
 
-- The JAM would be developed into a political organization 
throughout Iraq. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
AN IMPORTANT BAGHDAD AYATOLLAH WEIGHS IN TOO 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Al-Rubaie told us that on the night of July 6 Allawi 
and Al-Rubaie called on Ayatollah Hussein al-Sadr at the 
Gadhimiya Mosque in Baghdad.  According to Al-Rubaie, 
Hussein al-Sadr said it would be best for the IIG not to 
deal with Muqtada al-Sadr directly.  Instead, the Ayatollah 
advised, the IIG should try to find suitable men around al- 
Sadr with whom the IIG can work.  (Comment: Ayatollah al- 
Sadr advocates avoiding violence and has been friendly to 
the coalition, though in earlier meetings with CPA, he 
generally urged that we take a tough law-enforcement 
approach with his nephew, Muqtada.  End comment.) 
 
------------------------------------------- 
PRIME MINISTER: INITIALLY SKEPTICAL, BUT... 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Al-Rubaie added that Allawi\'s initial reaction to 
the Bayt Shia petition was to recall that Muqtada al-Sadr 
had not recognized the IIG and instead had called it 
illegitimate.  Allawi wondered why, in this case, the IIG 
should suspend the legal case.  Al-Rubaie speculated, 
however, that Allawi might eventually decide it would be 
best to strike a more accomodating stance. 
 
7. (C) POLMIL Counselor cautioned that the coalition would 
not want to work with Muqtada al-Sadr, given that al-Sadr 
was a criminal charged with a crime.  Al-Rubaie stated that 
if Iran controlled al-Sadr then the IIG had to take a 
tougher line.  Al-Rubaie commented in passing that if al- 
Sadr represented a more genuine constituency, then it would 
be harder to exclude him.  He thought the Prime Minister 
might ultimately draw the same conclusion. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) As we are reported earlier, the JAM remains very 
much present in Najaf and Kufa, including at the Imam Ali 
Shrine; the custodian of the Imam Ali Mosque, for example, 
has not been able to return to Najaf.  It seems likely, 
therefore, that the petitioners received at least an 
informal blessing for their approach from key Najaf Hawza 
figures such as Ayatollahs Sistani and Mohammed said al- 
Hakim.  It is more surprising that the Bayt Shia would 
support the JAM becoming a political movement, as an al- 
Sadr political movement could poll well in some parts of 
Iraq at the expense of Dawa and SCIRI.  The more moderate 
Shia religious parties may reason that Muqtada al-Sadr 
would add Islamist seats to the parliament overall and they 
would thus be in a better position to form a largely Shia 
Islamist coalition with him.  Provided Muqtada al-Sadr and 
his supporters avoid provocation, this petition and the 
advice from Ayatollahs such as Hussein al-Sadr will make it 
harder for Allawi to exclude Muqtada\'s supporters from the 
political process.

SUBJECT: USEB 072: THE IRAQI INTERIM GOVERNMENT AND AL- 
JAZEERA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DCM JAMES JEFFREY FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  On July 10, Iraqi Prime Minister Dr. 
Ayad Allawi met with the chief of the news room from Al- 
Jazeera\'s Doha headquarters, Mr. Sadi Al-Shouly (who is 
also responsible for all worldwide Al-Jazeera 
correspondents), along with Al-Jazeera\'s Baghdad Bureau 
Chief, Mr. Hamid Hadeed.  The meeting, originally 
scheduled to last one-half hour, was extended to an hour 
and a half as PM Allawi effectively read the riot act to 
his two visitors.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) A witness to the session reports the following 
highlights.  Prime Minister Allawi opened his meeting 
with the two visitors from Al-Jazeera with a question: 
\"So what are your plans for harming the Iraqi people 
these days?\"  The deflated Al-Jazeera guests were then 
treated to a thorough dressing-down, with Allawi accusing 
Al-Jazeera of having a political agenda, and then 
assuring his visitors that their agenda \"will fail\" and 
that the Iraqi people will be victorious regardless of 
Al-Jazeera\'s efforts to undermine stability in the 
region. 
 
3. (C) Among the specific accusations that Allawi leveled 
against Al-Jazeera were the following: 
 
-- the lack of accurate and factual reporting by Al- 
Jazeera correspondents on the ground in Iraq; 
 
-- the station acting as a mouthpiece for terrorists by 
airing their audio and video tapes; 
 
-- and broadcasting videos of masked men trying to 
intimidate him and the Iraqi people. 
 
The PM stressed that Al-Jazeera will fail in its goal, as 
he and his people \"have been through too much hardship to 
be threatened by a group of masked men\". 
 
4. (C) The PM also stated that he is going to approach 
the Qatari government to discuss the impact that a state- 
run broadcaster such as Al-Jazeera has on IraqiQQatari 
bilateral relations. 
 
5. (C) Allawi continued, that regardless of its efforts, 
99% of the Iraqi people reject Al-Jazeera and its agenda, 
and are aware that Al-Jazeera never covers any positive 
news stories; rather, Iraqis understand that Al-Jazeera\'s 
sole interest is incitement to discontent, even violence. 
The PM also informed his visitors that there is now an 
independent Iraqi media commission that will hold media 
organizations accountable for malpractice and 
provocation.  Further, he conveyed that neither he, nor 
any members of his staff, will cooperate with Al-Jazeera 
until they adjust their coverage.  The PM did mention, 
however, that he will send a representative to Doha next 
week to represent Iraq in a conference which Al-Jazeera 
is holding with key political figures, in order to 
reiterate these points.  He concluded by acknowledging 
that \"it is acceptable, even welcome, to criticize the 
Interim Government; however, do not dare harm the people 
of Iraq\". 
 
6. (C) The Al-Jazeera representatives got the message. 
For their part, they claimed that the shortfalls in Al- 
Jazeera coverage of Iraq cited by the PM were often due 
to an inability to obtain information and clarification 
from official sources concerning breaking news events, a 
lack of government spokesmen and an Iraqi Interim 
Government public affairs infrastructure. 
 
7. (C) Comment: Shortly after the transfer of sovereignty 
to his government, PM Allawi told us that he was thinking 
of closing the Al-Jazeera bureau in Baghdad and banning 
Al-Jazeera correspondents from Iraq.  Our counsel was to 
take another approach;  to inform Al-Jazeera that their 
reporting is under scrutiny, and that the government 
intends to monitor media coverage through an independent 
commission.  PM Allawi did exactly that in his meeting 
with these representatives from Al-Jazeera.  End comment.

SUBJECT: USEB 112: DEPUTY SECRETARY\'S MEETING WITH IRAQI PRIME 
MINISTER ALLAWI 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN D. NEGROPONTE FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. Prime Minister Allawi told the Deputy Secretary 
that he and his counterparts in the Arab world are looking 
forward to his tour of the region.  Allawi plans to have an open 
and honest discussion with Syria about their involvement in 
Iraqi affairs.  He would like to see Interior Ministers of 
regional states work together to address border security issues. 
Allawi said he believes that the Government is making headway 
against the insurgents, and he has told those fighting the 
Interim Government that they are welcome in the political 
process on condition that they work within the law.  Planning 
for the National Conference is coming along, but logistics and 
security are proving to be obstacles.  The Deputy Secretary 
engaged Allawi on ways to use the UN General Assembly to Iraq\'s 
advantage, and he noted that the U.S. Congress plans to stay 
engaged in Iraq.  Allawi said prompt implementation of U.S. 
reconstruction projects is essential to easing Iraq\'s 
unemployment problem.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------- 
ALLAWI TO KEY ON SYRIA FIRST 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Deputy Secretary Armitage met with Iraqi Prime Minister 
Ayad Allawi on July 18.  Ambassador Negroponte, Assistant 
Secretary Burns, and MNF-I Commander General Casey also attended 
the meeting.  Allawi opened the meeting by noting that he will 
leave July 19 on a trip to Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, the 
UAE, and Kuwait.  He said he believes his Arab neighbors are 
looking forward to this visit. He plans to consult with them 
extensively about Iraq\'s security. 
 
3. (C) Allawi said that he hopes he can reason with Bashar Al- 
Asad of Syria, but he will be open and honest about the role 
that Syria has played in the insurgency in Iraq.  He said that 
his strategy for now is to neutralize the Syrian threat because 
the bigger threat is from Iran.  Allawi plans to ask King 
Abdullah of Jordan and President Mubarak of Egypt to put 
pressure on Asad to control the \"nerve center\" of foreign 
fighters and resources to the insurgency in Iraq.  The Deputy 
Secretary and Allawi agreed that Asad is too weak to control the 
elements coming out of Syria.  Allawi added that there is also 
evidence that Syrians are trying to rebuild the Ba\'ath party 
under another name to run for elections in January in Iraq. 
Allawi mentioned that Prime Minister Hariri of Lebanon told 
Deputy PM Barham Salih that Iraq will not make any headway with 
the Syrians.  However, Allawi plans to push the Syrians and 
demonstrate to them that a stable Iraq is in their long-term 
interest. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE UN PROTECTION FORCE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The Deputy Secretary briefed Allawi on his discussions 
with India and Pakistan concerning assistance to Iraqi security 
forces and troop contributions for the UN protection force.  The 
Deputy Secretary told Allawi that neither he nor Secretary 
Powell could get a commitment from the Pakistanis to contribute 
troops to Iraq, noting that the GOP may not want to be the first 
Muslim country to commit troops.  Allawi offered to call 
Musharaf to discuss the issue with him, but the Deputy Secretary 
encouraged him to wait. The Deputy Secretary said that the 
Indian Government has clearly limited its offer of support to 
training Iraqis in India. 
 
--------------------------- 
DEALING WITH THE INSURGENTS 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (C) With the exception of the past few days, Allawi said that 
he thought that the Interim Government was making headway 
against the insurgents.  He told the Deputy Secretary that he 
had some discussions with insurgents and he delivered a firm 
message: \"bring on violence and we will fight you; you are 
welcome in the political process, but you must work within the 
law.\"  The Deputy Secretary asked about the situation in Samara, 
which Allawi acknowledged is a problematic area.  Allawi 
described how he had met with Samarans with the clear message 
that unless they choose the political path, he would confront 
them.  Allawi added that the Samarans did not have too many 
demands, and those that they have can be met.  Allawi outlined 
his demands of the Samarans: 1) surrender criminals; 2) 
cooperate with the multinational forces; and 3) pass information 
to the authorities that will improve security.  He underscored 
that he has constantly emphasized that nobody is above the law 
and criminals will be punished. 
 
6. (C) Allawi told the Deputy Secretary that the IIG is working 
to ensure that essential services are provided.  U.S. 
reconstruction projects are very important because they will 
alleviate the unemployment problem Iraqis face.  Allawi has 
asked his ministers to provide weekly reports on essential 
services so that he can track improvements and publicize 
successes.  He has also asked the Minister of Health to report 
on civilian casualties caused by insurgents and the Minister of 
Electricity to report on the how the insurgents have affected 
the use of electricity in Iraq.  Allawi plans to publicize the 
reports to show Iraqis how disruptive the insurgents are to the 
Iraqis\' safety, security, and well-being. 
 
----------------------- 
THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) Although the political process is moving forward and 
preparations for the National Conference are coming along, 
Allawi said that logistics such as hotel rooms, Conference 
venue, and security are key challenges.  Allawi would like to 
the see the Conference shortened to two or even one day from its 
current three days in order to ease the logistical and security 
difficulties.  He said that the Conference will either take 
place at the Convention Center or at Baghdad University. \"We are 
definitely going to proceed with it,\" he added.  The Deputy 
Secretary underscored the importance of the Conference, adding 
that it will be a milestone for Iraq, demonstrating to Iraqis 
and the international community the GovernmentQs ability to make 
decisions and follow through on initiatives. 
 
8. (C) Allawi mentioned that Iraq is still lacking a good 
program for reconciliation and national unity but he hopes that 
the National Conference will be a starting point for 
discussions.  He added that he hopes his trip through the region 
will help with a dialogue on reconciliation.  He also wants to 
organize a meeting of the interior ministers from Iraq\'s 
neighbors to discuss the security situation and border security 
which will help with the same process of reconciliation. 
 
------------------------------- 
UNGA AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IRAQ 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The Deputy Secretary urged Allawi to make good use of the 
UN General Assembly session in September to talk with his 
counterparts in the Arab world and beyond.  Allawi acknowledged 
that he had not thought about UNGA, but he did not think that it 
would be particularly useful.  Instead, he proposed a meeting 
that would include G-8 countries, Egypt, Morocco, and other 
Islamic countries to specifically discuss the stability of Iraq. 
Allawi said that such a meeting could empower Iraq to send a 
message to Iran and Syria, and he thought it would be a useful 
tool to reflect on security in the region. 
 
10. (C) The meeting ended by Allawi thanking the Deputy 
Secretary for the United States\' continued support.  The Deputy 
Secretary stressed the U.S. commitment to Iraq.  The U.S. is 
focused on speeding up the disbursement of funds that Congress 
appropriated for Iraq\'s reconstruction.  Ambassador Negroponte 
added that he and the Deputy Prime Minister met to discuss 
forming a joint U.S.-Iraqi committee that will talk about the 
best way to spend the appropriations.

SUBJECT:  USEB 143:  SUNNIS WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT SAYS 
INFORMED SOURCE 
 
(U)  CLASSIFIED BY POL-MIL COUNSELOR RONALD E. NEUMANN FOR 
REASONS 1.4 (A) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  Sunnis are hostile, divided, leaderless, 
and unable to envision a political solution acceptable to 
others according to a very well-informed Jordanian 
diplomat.  Some would like to enter into an agreement with 
us to resume rule, an approach we find illusionary. End 
summary. 
 
2.  (C) Pol Counselor Ford and Pol-Mil Counselor Neumann 
met July 20 with Jordanian Charge Demi Haddad (strictly 
protect).  Haddad has extensive Sunni contacts built up 
over several years in Iraq.  He reports that more Sunnis 
than ever are coming through his doors.  The picture he 
painted was depressing.  Haddad said that after nearly 100 
years of repressive rule the Sunnis cannot envision a 
situation in which they can protect their interests without 
domination.  The only alternative appears to be permanent 
suppression.  Although outsiders see the potential for an 
alliance with the Kurds to block Shi\'ite domination, Haddad 
said there is too much bloodshed between the communities. 
The logic might work in another decade but the Sunnis do 
not believe in it now. 
 
3.  (C) There are multiple Sheikhs and sheikh-ly contenders 
in the Sunni ranks.  There is no agreement on leadership 
among them.  Efforts to consolidate under any one leader 
meet internal opposition.  Without a single strong leader 
to give form to new ideas, the tribesmen fall back into 
hostility and resentment. 
 
4.  (C) Haddad said he finds the Sunnis chasing half-formed 
conceptions.  Several Sheikhs have suggested that the only 
way to impose leadership on Iraq is to return to a 
monarchy.  But they cannot name an acceptable candidate. 
They typify Sharif Ali as the \"son of an Egyptian whore.\" 
They believe the U.S. is hostile to Prince Hassan bin 
Tallal of Jordan and therefore discount him.  A third 
candidate is said to be timid and attracts no support.  Yet 
Sunni Sheiks continue to argue for a monarchy as a 
principle, even though they cannot figure out how it would 
work. 
 
5.  (C) Some of the Sheiks continue to hope they can make a 
\"deal\" to rule Iraq in return for concessions to U.S. 
interests.  This view is supported by many conversations we 
have had that focus on themes of \"give us jobs, pay us\" and 
all will be calm.  \"You can realize your American interests 
and we\'ll all be rich.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C) Clearly not every Sunni falls into this 
description.  Yet it suggests that for many the continued 
fighting is seen as their only alternative to being ruled. 
Their image of a deal to make them again the rulers of Iraq 
strikes us as fanciful. 
 
7.  (C) The Shia genie is out of the bottle.  The Kurds 
have too many memories of suppression to go down the Sunni 
road.  And the Sunni themselves are far too divided to make 
and keep a bargain.  Probably the best we can hope for is 
that as the IIG gains credibility and strength, Sunni 
elements will decide, incrementally, to cut deals to join a 
process they cannot stop.  Some, like President Ghazi, have 
already made their accommodation.

04/748. 
 
(U)  CLASSIFIED BY POL-MIL COUNSELOR RONALD E. NEUMANN FOR 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. On June 20, 2004, International Committee 
for the Red Cross (ICRC) Baghdad Head of Delegation 
Christophe Beney delivered copies of two letters (Refs A 
and B) to Pol-Mil Minister Ambassador Neumann. Both letters 
were labeled \"Confidential.\" Both were addressed to General 
George W. Casey, Commanding General of the Multi-National 
Force-Iraq (MNF-I), and copied to Ambassador Negroponte. 
 
2. (C) The text of both letters, which detail ICRC concerns 
regarding MNF-I detainee procedures, is reproduced below. 
The first letter (Ref A) concerns two Pakistani ICRC 
interviewees who informed ICRC that they had been 
transferred to Afghanistan from Iraq while in Coalition 
custody, in violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention. The second letter (Ref B) concerns ICRC 
objections to the Coalition\'s provision of timely 
information regarding detentions and detainees to ICRC 
officials.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) 
Baghdad Head of Delegation Christophe Beney delivered 
copies of two letters (Refs A and B) to Pol-Mil Minister 
Ambassador Neumann.  Both letters are dated July 20, 2004. 
Both are addressed to Gen. George W. Casey, Commanding 
General, MNF-I, and both are copied to Ambassador 
Negroponte and Major General Geoffrey Miller, Deputy 
Commanding General for Detainee Operations, MNF-I. 
 
4. (C) Begin text of Ref A. 
 
The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) would 
like to submit to your attention the following issue of 
great concern. 
 
During an ICRC visit to Camp Bagram Collection Point (BCP) 
in Afghanistan on 24 to 28 May, 2004, the ICRC met two 
Pakistani internees who claimed to have been arrested in 
Iraq at the end of February 2004. These individuals, who 
identified themselves respectively as Amanullah and Salah 
Mohammad Ali Al-Hayyan, were allegedly arrested in Baghdad 
by U.S. forces. They claimed to have been detained for 
approximately one month in Iraq, presumably in Abu Ghraib, 
prior to their transfer to BCP at the end of March. 
 
During private interviews with other internees at the time 
of the 24 to 28 May visit to BCP, the ICRC also received 
allegations of the detention in Afghanistan of two other 
persons who had been arrested in Iraq. The concerned 
individuals were identified to the ICRC as: Abdallah, 
Saudi, and Hossam, Yemeni, both arrested in March 2004 in 
Fallujah. Both were allegedly transferred from Iraq to an 
undisclosed place of detention run by U.S. services in 
Afghanistan, a place of detention to which ICRC has not 
been granted access. Both internees were allegedly 
transferred out of this place to an unknown destination in 
April 2004. In addition, these four individuals were 
neither notified to the ICRC in Iraq nor met by the ICRC 
during the course of its visits there. 
 
The ICRC would like to emphasize that Article 49 of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention (GC IV) prohibits forcible 
transfers of protected persons from occupied territory to 
the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any 
other country regardless of their motive. The violation of 
Article 49 constitutes a grave breach of the GC IV, as 
provided in Article 147 GC IV. The ICRC therefore calls 
upon U.S. authorities to investigate the circumstances in 
which this violation could have occurred and to take the 
necessary measures as required by Article 146 GC IV. 
 
The ICRC is deeply concerned for the welfare of internees 
transferred out of Iraq and recalls its request to be 
notified in a timely manner of all arrests made there. The 
ICRC further requests to be informed of the whereabouts of 
those who have been transferred to undisclosed locations 
and asks that it be granted access to them without delay. 
 
Copies of this letter are also being provided to the U.S. 
Embassy in Kabul and the Commander of the CJTF 180 in 
Afghanistan. In Washington, copies are being provided to 
the relevant authorities of the Pentagon, State Department, 
and National Security Council, in furtherance of the ICRC\'s 
dialogue with U.S. authorities on issues of U.S. detention 
policy and practices. 
 
We thank you in advance for your cooperation and remain, 
Yours sincerely, Christophe Beney, Head of Delegation, ICRC 
Iraq\". 
 
End text. 
 
5. (C) Begin text of Ref B. 
 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) would 
like to draw your attention to the following issues of 
concern. 
 
The existing system of notification to the ICRC of persons 
captured and detained under the control of the U.S. 
authorities in Iraq has led to instances in which 
notifications have not always been complete and timely. In 
some cases, the ICRC discovered that it had not been 
notified about the capture and internment of certain 
individuals, and that such individuals were not presented 
to the ICRC during its visits to internment facilities in 
Iraq. 
 
Notification should include: the surname, first names, 
place and date of birth, nationality, place of last 
residence, distinguishing characteristics, father\'s first 
name, mother\'s maiden name, the date, place, and nature of 
the action taken with regard to the individual, the address 
at which correspondence may be sent to him, and the name 
and address of the internee\'s contact person. 
 
It is also essential that ICRC receives all capture cards 
correctly completed upon capture, a complete list of the 
population of each place of internment at the time of each 
ICRC visit, and, on a weekly basis, a consolidated list of 
all persons who are held under the responsibility of U.S. 
authorities for more than 14 days. Appropriate information 
must also be provided concerning transfers, releases, 
deaths or escapes. 
 
The following examples illustrate the problem of absence or 
delayed notification of persons deprived of their liberty 
held by U.S. authorities in Iraq: 
 
(1) In its letter BAG-Field 04/184, dated 4 March 2004, 
addressed to Lieutenant General R. Sanchez, Commander CJTF- 
7, the ICRC reported the case of three Saudi nationals who 
were not notified until five weeks after their arrest. The 
delay of notification was most likely decided by those 
responsible for their interrogation. The ICRC still expects 
a reply from the U.S. authorities on this serious problem 
of delayed notification. 
 
(2) Two Pakistani internees (Amanullah and Salah Mohammed 
Ali Al-Hayyan) met by the ICRC during a visit to Bagram 
Collection Point in Afghanistan in May 2004 claimed that 
they had been interned under U.S. control in Iraq, probably 
in Abu Ghraib, between February and March 2004. Both 
internees were eventually transferred to Bagram Collection 
Point at the end of March. The ICRC has raised the issue of 
transfers of internees from Iraq to Afghanistan in its 
letter Bag 07/747, dated July 20. 
 
(3) U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated 
publicly on 17 June 2004 that an internee had been hidden 
from ICRC in Iraq for seven months. It was only after this 
announcement, and upon the ICRC\'s repeated insistence to be 
provided with the name of this individual, that the U.S. 
authorities in Iraq informed the ICRC of the identity of 
the concerned person. A 04 July 2004 letter signed by Major 
General G. Miller indicated the name as Hiea Abdrumen 
Rassul currently held in Camp Cropper. 
 
With regard to each of these cases, the ICRC is concerned 
that the lack of notification was not the result of 
administrative mistakes, but rather a deliberate decision 
not to allow the ICRC to perform its functions in a 
satisfactory manner. 
 
Therefore, we respectfully request that you give all the 
necessary instructions to ensure that the ICRC is notified 
of all arrests in a timely, reliable, and complete manner. 
 
We thank you in advance for your cooperation and remain, 
Yours sincerely, Christophe Beney, Head of Delegation, ICRC 
Iraq.

6. (C) Post is aware that copies of these letters were 
made available to Maj. Gen Miller by ICRC Baghdad HoD Beney 
on June 20, 2004.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, MOPS, IZ 
SUBJECT: USEB 154: 1ST MARINE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE DISCUSSES 
SITUATION IN AL ANBAR PROVINCE 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN FOR REASONS 1.4 (A) AND (D). 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY:  PolMilCouns Ambassador Neumann and PolCouns 
Robert Ford, along with staff, traveled to Fallujah for a 
familiarization visit on 14 July, 2004 to meet with 1st Marine 
Expeditionary Force (1MEF) CG Conway, 1st Marine Divison 
(MARDIV) CG Mattis, and Regimental Combat Team 1 (RCT-1) Col 
Toolan.  The Marines presented the recent timeline of events in 
Fallujah from late March 2004, when Americans were murdered in 
the city and Marines were subsequently ordered in, through the 
present situation, characterized by an uneasy stand-off between 
the Coalition security forces and a collection of locals making 
up the Fallujah Brigade.  They displayed a cautious sense of 
optimism about the growing internal divide between moderates and 
extremists within the city.  1MEF is focusing on accelerating a 
handover of security to local Iraqi control by 31 December and 
was aware of the necessary hurdles to overcome in order for that 
goal to be achieved.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S) Commanding General 1st MARDIV Mattis and RCT-1 Commander 
Colonel Toolan briefed the timeline of events that took place in 
Fallujah from late March 2004 through the creation of the 
\"Fallujah Brigade\" to the present situation.  They discussed the 
attacks on Americans on March 31, offensive operations by the 
Marines in early April, the negotiations with various local 
leaders and Governing Council representatives, and the present 
\"wait and see\" strategy-- essentially a middle ground between 
destruction and rebuilding.  Fallujah remains a denied area to 
the Marines, and while the Marines are not undertaking offensive 
operations, they are also not at liberty to funnel 
civil/military funding to the city since they do not have 
freedom of movement.  As a consequence, USD 27 million worth of 
projects remains on hold for Fallujah itself, whereas in the 
surrounding areas, such as Qarmah and Saqlawiyah, there are USD 
13 million worth of projects ongoing.  The 1st MARDIV hopes that 
this dichotomy will make Fallujans realize it is to their 
benefit to work constructively with Coalition forces. 
 
3.  (S) The Marines indicated they have a strong troop 
concentration in Fallujah\'s outlying areas, which has helped to 
stabilize the city\'s surrounding towns, whereas insurgents and 
foreign fighters largely operate without constraint within the 
city, where the Fallujah Brigade and other Iraqi security forces 
have failed to secure the city.  Coalition forces are still 
seeking to disrupt insurgents and foreign jihadists with 
surgical strikes against Abu Mus\'ab al Zarqawi-related targets 
within the town in order to prevent Fallujah from operating as a 
safe-haven for extremists.  Marines viewed the Fallujah Brigade 
as having failed to provide security, but they did view the 
force as \"buying time\" for the Coalition forces to create a rift 
between moderates and extremists.  1MEF also appeared optimistic 
about new Iraqi security forces, indicating there is ever- 
increasing coordination between the Iraqi National Guard and the 
Iraqi police. 
 
4.  (S) Civil affairs officers attached to RCT-1 view their 
increasing contacts with area residents, the contracts they\'ve 
awarded, and the compensation claims they honored to repair 
homes and buildings after the April conflict as driving a wedge 
between moderates and extremists in Fallujah.  These 
compensation payments have stopped due to the hardliners\' 
control of the city. More Fallujans are realizing these benefits 
of Coalition presence and are edging away from extremists. 
Likewise, the release of prominent Fallujah imam Shaykh Jamal 
Shakir al-Nazzal and Albu Issa Shaykh Barakat Sa\'dun al-Issawi 
have added voices of moderation in Fallujah and among insurgents 
since their release from Abu Ghurayb prison in April 2004.  In 
the Marines\' estimation, most Fallujah residents are growing 
weary of foreign fighters and Islamic extremists, and are 
tolerant of the recent surgical strikes against Zarqawi related 
targets.  The U.S. military\'s Fallujah Liaison Center (FLC), 
located approximately 2.5 miles from Fallujah, in between the 
city and 1MEF/RCT-1 headquarters, is a neutral area that serves 
as the main point of interaction between Coalition forces and 
Fallujah citizens.  The civil affairs team reported a large 
daily stream of businessmen, local shaykhs, Iraqi security 
forces, and average residents who come to bid for contracts, 
submit claims, or lodge complaints. 
 
5.  (C) 1MEF and 1st MARDIV reported that Fallujans and 
residents from Al Anbar still resent and often complain that 
they have no representation in the new Iraqi Interim Government 
and that Baghdad does not represent their interests -- a view 
similar to their estimation of the former Governing Council. 
Most Fallujah residents have little connection to Baghdad and 
appear more focused on local problems or contentions with local 
officials and tribes in Ramadi. 
 
6.  (S)  1MEF, which takes a strategic view of its AOR, Al Anbar 
and Northern Babil province, is looking towards transitioning to 
local control by 31 December, facilitating participation in the 
national elections in January, and achieving Iraqi self- 
governance in the Anbar governorate and in Northern Babil.  They 
laid out a combined approach of security and stability 
operations, information operations, and civil affairs projects 
and activities in order to achieve this goal.  Improvement of 
the Iraqi security forces is central to this purpose, and 1MEF 
has seen improvements in this area, with ISF becoming more 
receptive and taking on a more proactive role.  Containing the 
border is also a key undertaking, however at this point only 
eight of the planned 32 border posts have been built. 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  The Marines are looking to more closely meld 
the political and military processes, including coordination and 
decisions, as well as achieve closer contact with the IIG and 
the Embassy.  The Marines said they would welcome monthly visits 
from the Embassy for further coordination.  They also look 
forward to the assignment of a long-term Department of State 
embedded person, but caution that short duration TDYers are not 
sufficient to build understanding of the area.  END COMMENT.

TAGS:  PGOV, PREF, IZ 
SUBJECT: USEB 149: KIRKUK\'S ARAB VILLAGES ADJUST TO 
TRANSITION; IMPRESSIONS ON THE ROAD TO RASHAD 
 
1. SUMMARY. The Arab villages west and south of Kirkuk are 
mostly poor and underdeveloped.  Thanks to extensive work 
by the Coalition Provisional Authority, USAID and U.S. 
military forces in the area, the USG has developed 
excellent working relationships with local tribal and 
political leaders.  A visit by Kirkuk Embassy Regional 
Office PolOffs on July 15 to two of these villages - 
Rashad and Yaychi - shows how villagers are adjusting to 
life after transition.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------- 
U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE 
---------------------- 
 
2. Changes in Rashad and Yaychi since the handover of 
sovereignty have been significant.  Violence has decreased, 
IED attacks against U.S. military convoys are at a post- 
liberation low, and local authorities take particular pride 
in keeping their villages crime free.  Gaines Mills, the 
nearest military forward operating base to both Rashad and 
Yaychi, houses a unit from the Second Brigade Combat Team 
of the 25th Infantry Division based at Kirkuk Air Base. 
The base sits in a huge open field 30 kilometers west of 
Kirkuk.  The only other FOB in the area - McHenry -- is 70 
kilometers away and covers the villages of Hawija, Riyad 
and areas further west.  In all, the two FOBs cover 
hundreds of villages, conducting patrols and engaging with 
local leaders on a regular basis.  Officers from the U.S. 
Embassy\'s Regional Office in Kirkuk accompany them when 
time permits.  They visited the towns on July 15. 
 
------ 
RASHAD 
------ 
 
3. It took PolOffs 55 minutes to drive from Kirkuk to 
Rashad, 45 kilometers to the southwest.  Along the paved 
road, shacks sold ice, wheat and produce.  Lamb carcasses 
hung from hooks in the 110 degree heat of the morning. 
Along the way, a short bridge crossing an aqueduct flowed 
with water.  After the bridge, hints of greenery appeared, 
sunflowers and flocks of sheep and goats dotted the 
landscape.  Agriculture and livestock form the area\'s 
economic backbone. 
 
4. Rashad Township consists of 66 villages, some with as 
few as three households, some with hundreds, covering a 
large area of Kirkuk Province that stretches south to the 
border with Salah al-Din.  The main road from Kirkuk to 
Tikrit bisects the region.  Unpaved roads lead to some 
villages, while others have no vehicle access at all. 
 
5. A collection of mud and brick structures two minutes off 
the road make up Rashad, the main town in a district of 
20,000 people.  The majority of the population is Arab, 
mostly from the Al-Ubaidi tribe, one of the oldest and 
largest in Iraq.  The houses in the town blend into the 
surrounding brown terrain -- except for three new, white 
structures: the police station, the city council building, 
and the communications center.  Coalition funds built all 
three. 
 
6. Except for three policemen standing guard outside the 
new station, Rashad\'s streets were empty when PolOffs 
arrived.  The police chief\'s office was spacious and air 
conditioned but plain.  His desk was bare except for the 
desk set, an Iraqi flag and a telephone on one corner.  The 
telephone only recently started working -- the first to 
work in the township since the liberation. 
 
7. Ten men buzzed about inside the office.  Four wore 
traditional garb: headscarves and robes.  Two wore business 
attire.  The rest wore crisp, new police uniforms, all 
provided by CPA.  The men in traditional garb were shaikhs, 
including Shaikh Louis, the mayor of Rashad. 
 
------------------------- 
U.S. ASSISTANCE TO RASHAD 
------------------------- 
 
8. The U.S. military has provided USD 400,000 in assistance 
to Rashad since liberation, drawn from the Commander\'s 
Emergency Relief Program (CERP).  The money paid for police 
checkpoints, new schools, bridges, water trucks and the 
communications center. 
 
9. Shaikh Louis pointed out that the village\'s needs remain 
great: water, electricity, roads and a new hospital. 
Residents cannot safely consume the local well water, and 
the six water trucks that CPA bought for  USD 20,000 cannot 
deliver to all the villages.  If the Coalition were to pave 
more roads, Shaikh Louis said, water delivery would be 
easier.  Electrical service is erratic, and the mayor said 
Rashad needs additional electrical lines.  To get medical 
aid, citizens must be taken to Kirkuk.  There are two local 
doctors, but they are ill-equipped.  The police chief said 
that when one of his men is shot, there is no way to 
provide emergency treatment short of driving to Kirkuk. 
 
---------- 
CEREMONIES 
---------- 
 
10. At the city council building, the mayor and the local 
U.S. military commander raised the Iraqi flag over the 
building in a symbolic display of the handover from CPA 
authority to local governance.  Speeches followed, with 
town council members and civil servants braving the intense 
midday heat to attend.  Two U.S. government-funded members 
of the Kirkuk press recorded the event. 
 
11. The big event on July 7, when PolOffs visited, was the 
opening of the new communications center.  The center has 
the capacity for 500 telephone lines, where none existed in 
the town since the war.  Before the opening, residents of 
Rashad had to drive to Kirkuk to make a phone call. 
 
-------------------- 
THE KURDISH QUESTION 
-------------------- 
 
12. Few Kurds live in the surrounding area, but animosity 
toward them is strong.  Two policemen had been shot and 
wounded in Rashad the night before PolOffs\' visit, one 
fatally.  Describing the incident the police chief said it 
was surely the work of \"outsiders,\" meaning Kurdish 
infiltrators. 
 
13. There were also complaints about ministry offices in 
Kirkuk, many now dominated by Kurds.  For example, Rashad\'s 
leaders complained that the Department of Water, which is 
run by Kurds, has stopped up the water pipes that Arab 
farmers depend on to water their crops.  The mayor and 
others listed additional grievances: Kurds are taking Arab 
land and the Kirkuk police chief is biased against Arabs. 
When asked to provide proof, a shaikh left the room and 
returned with a DVD.  On the television screen, the Kirkuk 
chief of police was shown making what looks like a stump 
speech: \"Kirkuk is not just a part of Kurdistan.  Kirkuk is 
the heart of Kurdistan.\"  He repeated the phrase twice. 
Rashad\'s political elite said they believe their case is 
open and shut. 
 
------ 
YAYCHI 
------ 
 
14. Yaychi is 60 kilometers northeast of Rashad and 
resembles its sister town in some ways: the brown hut-like 
houses; power lines running in all directions; and a few 
new buildings that stand apart.  In some ways, the two are 
distinct.  In Yaychi, the schools are painted with splashes 
of color, children play outside and people are on the 
streets even in the 120 degree midday heat. 
 
------------------------- 
U.S. ASSISTANCE TO YAYCHI 
------------------------- 
 
15. Where the police chief\'s office in Rashad was stark, 
the mayor\'s office was steeped with paperwork and pictures 
of himself with U.S. military personnel.  After greeting 
PolOffs, Yaychi\'s Mayor Abdul Kareem broke into a serenade 
of thanks for all the projects the U.S. has brought his 
people.  Yaychi has received USD 250,000 worth of U.S. 
military aid from CERP funds.  A man brought forward a two- 
and-a-half meter tall, one meter wide board filled with 
photos and descriptions of projects the town has completed 
with these DFI funds: new schools, new mosques, a renovated 
hospital, paved roads, new bridges, a police station, even 
a veterinary hospital.  He then handed certificates of 
thanks to each military officer in the room and had his 
photo taken handing them out. 
 
16. The local Coalition military commander gave a short 
speech that climaxed in the statement that these projects 
were a \"testimony of a government that cares about its 
people.\"  Mentioning the oil pipeline that runs through the 
villages, he said that \"attacks on the pipeline directly 
hurt the people of this community.\"  He also encouraged 
Yaychi\'s people to turn in to proper authorities those who 
would harm the township.  Mayor Abdul Kareem responded with 
the message that \"our economy is improving....everyone has 
benefited from liberation,\" ending with \"Thank you for our 
liberation.\" 
 
---------- 
CEREMONIES 
---------- 
 
17. The visit to Yaychi had the same purpose as the visit 
to Rashad  a ceremonial handover of sovereignty from CPA 
to the local government and a flag-raising in front of the 
city council building to mark the occasion.  A small group 
of people witnessed the ceremony and listened as local 
dignitaries make speeches.  Along with all the members of 
the Yaychi town council, the police chief from Rashad came 
as a visiting public figure.  He said he plans to combine 
the two localities\' police forces under his command. 
 
18. With one ceremony over, the group piled into new, CPA- 
purchased police trucks for a two-minute drive to the 
highlight of the day: the ribbon-cutting at a new 
marketplace established with CERP funds.  The marketplace 
contained six cement stalls linked together on the 
outskirts of town.  The mayor and the U.S. military 
commander surrounded themselves with locals and created a 
ceremony for the ribbon cutting.  \"Tomorrow,\" the mayor 
said aloud, \"people selling food, drinks, clothing and 
other goods will fill these stalls.\" 
 
--------------------------- 
AGAIN, THE KURDISH QUESTION 
--------------------------- 
 
19. Of the 38 villages in Yaychi, three are Kurdish and 
another three Turkman, so residents rarely blame particular 
\"outsiders\" for town problems.  Still, during PolOffs\' 
visit, council members poured their problems on the 
military commander and hinted at a Kurdish conspiracy.  The 
municipal departments in Kirkuk continued to ignore them, 
and the council members pointed specifically to three 
departments -- agriculture, water and municipalities -- all 
Kurdish-controlled.  The members said that they did not 
feel a particular discrimination against Kurds, the people 
of Yaychi only want the services they feel they are due. 
 
20. The complaints continued.  The mayor has to pay for his 
own bodyguards.  None of the department employees come from 
Kirkuk to visit them or hear their requests.  The local 
Government receives complaints in Kurdish and feels 
compelled to respond to the complaints, but has no Kurdish 
translators.  \"Arabic is the language of the Koran.  It 
should be good enough for Yaychi,\" one council member 
concluded. 
 
-------------- 
OTHER VILLAGES 
-------------- 
 
21. The Coalition has assisted many other villages in 
Kirkuk besides Rashad and Yaychi.  USAID, for example, 
provided 13 km of paved road in the far southwest corner of 
Kirkuk province near the village of al-Asfar.  The project 
cost USD 557,000 of which USAID contributed USD 429,000 
drawn from appropriated funds under the Community Action 
Program (CAP).  The remainder came from local 
contributions.  Local government teams with AID contractor 
RTI worked with the local council committees in training 
them on preparing bid packages and making transparent 
decisions.

Classified by Anne E. Derse FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (S) On July 25, Ahmed Salman, legal advisor to Deputy 
Prime Minister Baram Salih, met with EMIN and Embassy 
Legal Adviser at the DPM\'s request to discuss the USG\'s 
proposed order on insurgent finance.  Salman said that 
the DPM would be seeking an appointment on July 26 to 
meet with Ambassador Negroponte to discuss the issue 
further.   He said the DPM remains very concerned with 
respect to the specific scope of the order and who would 
be subject to it.  For example, the DPM is worried that a 
member of the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) could be 
designated as an insurgent under the order, depending on 
the definition.  In addition, the DPM is concerned with 
how \"insurgent\" would be defined and what role, if any, 
the IIG would have in determining who is subject to the 
order.  Salman noted that the position the DPM takes in 
principle on the desirability of the proposed order would 
depend on the scope of the order, ie, to whom this would 
apply.  He also said that the DPM needs to better 
understand the details in order to take a position.  He 
asked whether a list of specific entities or individuals 
had been prepared.  He noted that Iraq probably did have 
legal authority under existing law to implement similar 
provisions per Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) 
Order 93.  He undertook to raise again with the DPM the 
issue of adding \"Iraqi forces\" to the list of targets. 
We underscored Washington\'s interest in receiving IIG 
views as soon as possible.

SUBJECT:  GOVERNOR IN TROUBLE-RIDDEN ANBAR PROVINCE HELD 
HOSTAGE 
 
(U)  Classified by POL Counselor Robert Ford for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  The Governor of Anbar Province, perhaps 
the most violence-plagued part of Iraq, feels isolated and 
trapped in his office while he tries to secure the release 
of his three kidnapped sons.  The Governor doubts he can 
trust either the police chief or the Iraqi National Guard 
Commander in Anbar.  The Governor has talked of resigning 
as part of a bargain to gain his sons\' release, but he told 
the Interior Minister that he will stay.  Even if he does, 
the credibility of Iraqi security forces in Anbar has taken 
a hit.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Anbar Provincial Governor Burgis\' three eldest sons 
were kidnapped on the night of July 28.   Iraqi police 
guarding the Governor\'s residence were either ineffectual 
in defending the Governor\'s family or complicit in the 
commission of the crime.  Iraqi police and other security 
forces have since claimed they have no evidence to follow, 
according to the State Department liaison officer embedded 
with military forces in Ramadi. 
 
3.  (C) In the days since the kidnapping, Burgis seems to 
be in touch with the kidnappers, who appear to be linked 
terrorist groups, and will meet their demands for his sons\' 
release.  An aide to the Governor said that the motive for 
the kidnapping appears to be forcing the Governor\'s 
resignation.  This aide also claims that the Governor and 
he both believe the Police Chief and the Iraqi National 
Guard Commander are complicit in the kidnapping.  Burgis 
has met with US military personnel and the Ramadi State 
Department liaison officer, but has shared little 
information concerning the whereabouts and identity of the 
kidnappers.  Burgis even went so far as to ask the Marine 
Commanding General for help on paying the ransom, according 
to the liaison officer. 
 
4.  (C)  In the midst of this, the Governor has basically 
stopped work.  Since there is no Deputy Governor in Anbar, 
the functions of the Governor\'s post are not being 
fulfilled. 
 
5.  (C)  On August 1, ADCM and PolCouns met with Deputy 
Prime Minister Salih to urge the interim Government to 
respond quickly.  Salih said the Interior Minister would 
visit Anbar on August 2.  He acknowledged that the 
Government might need to find a new Governor, but no 
candidate immediately came to mind.  He also cautioned that 
the Governorate Council would probably have to elect the 
new governor.  PolCouns asked if the IIG could invoke the 
new state security law to enable the IIG to make the 
appointment of a governor.  Salih responded that it would 
be very difficult to utilize the law in Anbar now. 
According to the DPM, the IIG had not prepared public 
opinion for such a step. 
 
6.  (C)  On the evening of August 2, Minister of Interior 
Felah Naqib arrived in Ramadi and met the Governor.  Naqib 
urged Anbar officials to send a delegation to Baghdad on 
Saturday, August 7 to discuss the situation further. 
Deputy PM Salih told A/DCM on August 2 that Governor Burgis 
told the Interior Minister Naqib that he will not resign. 
 
7.  (C)  On August 3, the Ramadi liaison officer reported 
that the Anbar Provincial Council Vice=President told him 
on August 2 that a Sheikh Nassir of the Fahdawi tribe has 
proposed new candidates for the governor and empty 
provincial council slots.  The names proposed allegedly all 
are from the Fahdawi tribe (to which the local Iraqi 
National Guard commander also belongs) and the al-Wani 
tribe (to which the Police Chief belongs). 
 
8.(C) Comment:  Anbar has a difficult security environment 
and now its local government is in a state of crisis, with 
the Governor unable to trust those around him and unable to 
function.  Although Burgis told Interior Minister Naqib 
that he will hang on, our sense is that he is looking for a 
way out of Ramadi in any case (On July 23, Burgis already 
told visiting Polcouns that he wanted to quit).  Even if 
the Anbar Governor stays, his ability to function is at 
question amidst the antagonism he confronts with some of 
the tribes.  The credibility of the Iraqi security forces 
in Anbar also is in question. End Comment.

SUBJECT: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR DISCUSSES CEASEFIRE 
TERMS WITH MOQTADA AL SADR BUT PM NOT ON BOARD 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POL-MIL COUNSELOR RONALD E. NEUMANN FOR 
REASONS 1.4 (A) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Muaffaq al Rubaie, reached at our initiative in the 
afternoon of August 13, said he was approaching agreement 
with an envoy of Moqtada al Sadr over a nine point peace 
plan (para 6 below.)  Apparently Rubaie had never been able 
to meet with Sadr but met several times with his envoy.  A 
ceasefire originally established only to facilitate the 
meeting has lasted most of the day.  The nine-point plan 
appears to have numerous weaknesses including: agreement on 
a pull-back by Coalition Forces; no timeline for turning 
over control of the mosques to the Iraqi government; and an 
open-ended provision for security forces for Moqtada and 
his Lieutenants. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador Negroponte, General Casey and Pol-Mil 
Counselor Neumann met with Prime Minister Allawi at 1600 
hours.  Allawi had not talked to Muaffaq since 0900 hours. 
He had not heard of the nine-point plan.  Allawi said his 
instructions had been to tell Sadr he had to get his forces 
out of Najaf and disband them and Sadr could be allowed to 
enter the political process.  Allawi said of the nine 
points, \"thatQs too much.\"  Allawi said he felt that Sadr 
was not serious and would not sign even these points.  He 
believed Sadr was trying to drag out negotiations and that 
it wasn\'t in the government\'s interest. 
 
3. (C) Allawi said that Iraqis are encouraged to move to 
the opposition by displays of weakness.  This is what 
happened earlier with both the spring negotiations with 
Moqtada and Fallujah.  He believes it important not to do 
that again. 
 
4. (C) Allawi is waiting for the return today of Defense 
Minister Sha\'lan, who is in Najaf.  Allawi will contact us 
as soon as he hears from MOD.  Allawi is very conscious 
that military operations have been interrupted and that 
time is being lost. 
 
5. (C) Comment: We saw no evidence in Allawi\'s comments or 
behavior that Rubaie is negotiating the weaker approach of 
the nine points on instruction from his boss.  Allawi said 
that he has not come under any serious political pressure 
from the other Shia religious leaders.  Although Allawi 
does not like the fact that Vice President Jafari and the 
Dawa Party are calling for a cease fire (staking out some 
distance in case operations fail), he does not seem 
inclined to change his approach.  SCIRI and its head Hakim 
have not said anything publicly.  Allawi felt that news 
coverage of Najaf exaggerated the situation but did not 
seem bothered by that either. 
 
6.  (C) Following are the nine points as taken down orally 
by telephone. 
 
Nine-Point Plan: 
 
1) MNF-I pullout of Najaf and Kufa with the exception of 
Military Police Trainers; 
 
2) SADR movement will work in constructive way with IIG 
to ensure security and stability in IQ and an honest 
election of a full, independent, elected government; 
 
3) Legal Case referred to Majariyh (or tribal 
customs?); 
 
4) Removal of all military, armed fighters and arms from 
whole governate with exception of para 6.  Najaf city 
administration and city security is duty of IIG and 
ISF, including inner city and shrine; 
 
5) JM - declare JM is not an armed militia but a popular 
ideological movement and, for the sake of preserving 
holy cities and keeping blood of our  sons, request 
all members lay down arms and dissolve all C2 centers 
and military and security establishments and handover 
all non-personal arms.  Members of this army can only 
carry arms under IQ law like other citizens; 
 
6) Personal Security:  MS has right to keep personal 
security for him, his offices and his lieutenants like 
any other distinguished dignitary in IQ political 
arena; 
 
7) Holy Shrine: 
 
i. administration by persons appointed by Majariyh; 
 
ii. forbidden to use shrine for political purposes; 
especially for political offices and Friday sermons; 
 
8) Release of all detainees and prisoners and those 
kidnapped in recent events (Note, this seems to refer 
to those detained in recent fighting only); 
 
9) Establish joint committee for coordination and follow 
up. 
 
7. (C) There are many things we do not like about these 
ideas.  Among them are a pullout of Coalition Forces, the 
lack of a definite time line and no commitment to a public 
statement.  MAS and his lieutenants have large numbers of 
\"bodyguards\" who have often been the main actors in illegal 
and bullying actions.  We noted some of these deficiencies 
to Allawi, who agreed.

TAGS: PINS, PGOV, KISL, IZ 
SUBJECT: IRAQI SHIA PARTIES NOT EMBRACING SADR 
 
Classified by POLCouns Robert Ford, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Some angry remarks at the National Conference 
notwithstanding, it appears that the Shia establishment is 
not rallying behind Muqtada al-Sadr in his standoff against 
the Iraqi Government.  Late on the night of August 14, 
PolCouns spoke to a top aide to Iraqi Government Vice 
President and Da\'wa Party leader Ibrahim Jaaferi.  The aide 
stated that Da\'wa would not boycott the National Conference 
under any circumstance.  According to the aide, Jaaferi 
stood by his call for a peaceful solution to the battle in 
Najaf.  Jaaferi understands that the Mahdi militia must 
disarm and the city be returned entirely to Government 
control.  Jaaferi recognizes the danger of making 
concessions to militias nationwide and the need to 
reestablish law and order.  Jaaferi\'s aide urged the U.S. 
to stay engaged in helping to restore stability in Iraq and 
assisting the country\'s political development. 
 
2.  (C) Meanwhile, a key Government minister from another 
major Shia establishment party, the Supreme Council for the 
Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), told the Ambassador on 
August 14 that the National Conference must succeed. 
Finance Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi said the Government made 
a mistake in opening negotiations with Sadr and that, if 
Sadr disavows violence and agrees to play a constructive 
role, military operations against him should recommence. 
 
3.  (C) PolCouns spoke on the evening of August 14 with 
Radwan Abbas, the custodian of Najaf\'s Imam Ali mosque who 
fled Najaf four months ago and is now in Baghdad.  Abbas 
assured PolCouns that the Najaf cleric establishment 
(Hawza) supports IIG and Coalition efforts to remove the 
Mahdi militia from Najaf/Kufa and the religious sites.  He 
said many clerics had to flee Najaf for their safety and 
many had come to Baghdad.  Abbas discounted the likelihood 
of public criticism from the Hawza if the Iraqi Government 
sends in forces to free the mosque from Sadr forces.  He 
pointed to the silence of late from the Hawza and quoted an 
Arabic proverb meaning that silence is a sign of consent. 
(He urged that we not send Coalition forces into the 
mosque, however.) 
 
4.  (C) On the morning of August 15, delegates from these 
Shia parties attended the Conference in large numbers.  A 
top SCIRI official in troubled Basra told the Regional 
Embassy Office on August 14 that he would attend the 
Conference as planned.  PolOffs at the Conference reported 
that there would be some speeches in support of a peaceful 
solution to the conflict in Najaf.  Post has also seen 
reports of a brief demonstration by Shia attendees of the 
National Conference demanding peace in Najaf.  The protest 
reportedly ended quickly and the Conference continued. 
There was also apparently some discussion of the Conference 
organizing a mission to go to Najaf directly to help 
facilitate a negotiated end to the standoff.  It was not 
clear if, in fact, such a team would actually go to Najaf. 
 
5.  (C) COMMENT: Publicly expressed concerns about Najaf 
notwithstanding, the two main Shia political parties are 
not rushing to help Sadr (their potential political 
competitor).  Instead, Dawa and SCIRI are holding fast to 
the political process launched by the Government, 
symbolized now by the National Conference.  The lack of 
criticism against the Government or the Coalition from the 
Najaf Hawza, combined with the prospect of making inroads 
into the National Council through participation in the 
ongoing National Conference, give those parties incentive 
to continue staying with the Government.  The crowds 
gathering at the Imam Ali mosque make good TV images, but 
Post does not yet sense that Sadr is gaining any traction 
with the Shia establishment.

SUBJECT: SHAHRISTANI COMMENTS ON NAJAF 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS ROBERT FORD FOR REASONS 1.4(B) AND 
(D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. In his call on Ambassador Negroponte, Dr. 
Hussain al-Shahristani was critical of the Iragi Interim 
Government\'s (IIG) handling of the situation in Najaf, 
believing that it has made Muqtada al-Sadr stronger and 
has cost the Government much support.  He urged against a 
military solution in Najaf, stressing that the grievances 
of supporters of the Mehdi army need to be addressed. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Dr. Hussain al-Shahristani, a nuclear scientist, 
President of the Iraqi National Academy of Science and 
prominent leader of Iraq\'s Shias, called on Ambassador 
Negroponte on August 14. 
 
3. (C) After initial introductions and pleasantries, the 
discussion turned to the situation in Najaf.  Dr. 
Shahristani said that he had been in Najaf previously, on 
a day of very heavy fighting.  He had wanted to see 
Muqtada al-Sadr in order to mediate.  Unfortunately, the 
fighting was too severe to enable Shahristani to go 
behind the military lines to meet with al-Sadr. 
 
4.  (C) The major problem at this time, said Shahristani, 
is that al-Sadr has gained strength and he and his Jaysh 
Mehdi are being seen sympathetically by increasing 
numbers of Iraqis -Q in large part because of clumsy 
handling of the situation by the IIG and Coalition 
forces.  He is seen as an underdog and has received 
considerably more popular attention than he deserves. 
Shahristani believes that there can be no military 
solution to the al-Sadr problem and the way it has been 
handled thus far is not in the best interests of the 
country.  Moreover, poor handling of al-Sadr in the media 
Q- statements insulting him, particularly by the Prime 
Minister and others -- has only aggravated the problem. 
It should be understood, said Shahristani, that the great 
majority of al-Sadr\'s supporters are very poor, deprived 
people, mostly Shia, who have gained nothing since 
Saddam\'s fall.  He also said that many of al-Sadr\'s 
supporters bear deep resentment for generations of 
poverty, deprivation and exclusion.  Their living 
conditions remain terrible. (In some areas of Sadr City, 
he noted, children have to walk through sewage to get to 
school.)  Their anger now has resulted from a sense that 
they are still excluded, even from the political process, 
and al-Sadr has taken advantage of that.  But al-Sadr and 
his supporters have also been able to gain sympathy among 
many Sunnis. 
 
5.  (C )Ambassador pointed out that some of the sense 
that nothing has changed is due to the lack of visibility 
of some of the improvements.  Few people can see or 
appreciate what has been done to provide for the flow of 
oil and the generation of more electricity, for example. 
Shahristani acknowledged that, but said that much more 
that is visible could be done.  An example of a program 
that had both visibility and tangible gains was a 
privately-funded \"Work-for-Food\" project in Karbala that, 
he said, was highly successful.  It had a budget of USD 
10,000, there was a program which employed about 450 men 
cleaning streets and individuals were paid with food 
baskets. 
 
6. (C) There was a time last year, Shahristani said, when 
he believes al-Sadr was willing to join in the political 
process, but he was pushed aside Q- particularly by 
educated Iraqis who had spent years in exile.  At times, 
al-Sadr has been receptive to joining in the political 
process; at this time he is not Q- and this would not be 
a good time to speak to him as he sees political gain in 
confrontation. 
 
7.  (C ) Shahristani does not believe that al-Sadr wants 
an Islamic state.  What he believes al-Sadr wants is 
respectability and, indeed, a share of power.  Al-Sadr 
has been able to successfully tap the long-standing 
desire on the part of many Shia for recognition and has 
gained the support of large numbers of people who have 
been marginalized and poor for generations -- descendants 
of laborers who had been the feudal poor and feel they 
have nothing to lose. 
 
8.  (C ) Ambassador commented that it would be strange to 
suggest that Sadr has a right to hold the city of Najaf. 
The Government\'s response to try to assert control over 
Najaf looks reasonable.  Shahristani agreed, saying that 
the Mehdi Army should disarm and retire from the city. 
He believes, however, that it is important to distinguish 
between the Mehdi insurgents and those, particularly in 
the Sunni triangle, who continue to hope for a 
resurrection of the Saddam regime.  What he considers the 
poor handling of al-Sadr and the Mehdi Army, particularly 
by a number of those in the IIG, has only intensified the 
situation and created more tensions.  The fighting in 
Najaf, he believes, was avoidable.  It has cost the 
Government much-needed support and led al-Sadr to take 
less rational positions.  Shahristani asked the 
Ambassador to use his influence to caution the IIG, 
believing that the U.S. has an important role to play, as 
does the United Nations. 
 
9.  (C) Shahristani does not consider Muqtada al-Sadr 
either helpful or admirable.  Neither does he see him as 
a serious religious leader.  However, he believes that 
the way to deal with al-Sadr is for him to be drawn into 
the political process rather than be forced into a 
confrontation.  More importantly, the poor, downtrodden, 
mostly Shia supporters of al-Sadr need to be given reason 
to feel that their circumstances are improving and that 
they have a stake in the new Government. 
 
10. (C) COMMENT:  Shahristani spoke quietly but earnestly 
about the grim situation confronting the Shia urban poor. 
He is a man of considerable integrity and is both 
dedicated to democratic values and the betterment of Iraq 
overall.  As a leader of the Shia community and close to 
Grand Ayatollah Sistani, his views can also be said to be 
the voice of Shia moderation.   That said, already by the 
evening of August 12, Iraqi Government National Security 
Advisor Rubaie was in Najaf trying to negotiate with 
Sadr.  Had Shahristani actually reached Sadr, a confused 
negotiating situation might have grown even more 
confused.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR OPENS FIRST AMERICAN CORNER IN IRAQ 
 
1.  Summary.  The Ambassador and Kurdistan Regional Government 
Minister of Culture Fatah Zakhoy opened the first American 
Corner in Iraq on August 8.  The Corner, located in the public 
library in Sulaimaniya, enables visitors to learn about the 
United States and to participate in American educational and 
cultural programming.  End summary. 
 
2.  The new American Corner is the first such facility in the 
country and is the largest cultural donation by the Embassy in 
northern Iraq to date.  The Corner is located on the ground 
floor of the newly-built public library in Sulaimaniya, in 
northeastern Iraq.  The Corner includes over USD 85,000 in 
books, furniture, and equipment donated by the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad with the support of NEA/PD and Embassy Amman. 
 
3.  At the ribbon-cutting event the Ambassador told the audience 
that activities at the Corner \"will broaden your perspective, 
deepen your knowledge, stimulate your imagination, and enrich 
your experience.\"  Minister Zakhoy welcomed the opening of the 
Corner and invited residents to use it to learn more about the 
United States.  Media coverage of the event included all local 
television channels and print publications.  All coverage was 
positive. 
 
4.  The Corner is staffed by English-speaking employees and 
includes hundreds of volumes about the United States, a video 
and DVD library, three high-speed Internet-connected computers, 
and videoconferencing capabilities.  Plans are already underway 
to connect university professors from the United States with 
professors and students at Sulaimaniya University through 
videoconferencing. 
 
5.  The Sulaimaniya Public Library recently opened to the public 
and currently has approximately 60,000 volumes.  In addition to 
the Internet machines at the Corner, it boasts the largest high- 
speed Internet access point in northern Iraq with over 75 
workstations (25 of which were purchased through CPA.)  Internet 
access is free and uncensored.  In addition, the library has 
three reading rooms, conference facilities, a children\'s 
library, and a children\'s theater. 
 
6.  Comment.  The American Corner is the largest cultural 
donation by the USG in northern Iraq, a fact not lost on 
Sulaimaniya\'s political leaders.  The leaders see the Corner as 
a USG statement about the relative safety of the KRG compared to 
the rest of the country.  The PAO has visited the Corner and 
during that visit noted that the Public Affairs section in 
Baghdad is committed to providing programming and staff 
training.  In addition, Embassy Baghdad will ensure that the 
facility and its information collection remain up-to-date.

SLOW 
 
Ref:  Baghdad 0320 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR ROBERT FORD FOR REASONS 
1.4 (A) (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (S) SUMMARY. In the past, cooperation between U.S. 
military units operating in Baghdad -- especially in Sadr 
City -- and Iraqi police has been problematic.  Indeed, the 
police chief in Sadr City on occasion has been positively 
unhelpful, if not hostile.  Local U.S. military commanders 
have been trying to gain more cooperation by engaging 
Deputy Minister of Interior Hekmat Musa Salman, Baghdad 
Iraqi Police Chief Abdul Rasaq and Baghdad Governor Ali 
Rahdi al-Haidary.  It remains to be seen whether these 
efforts will bear fruit.  Initial results from the past 
week of fighting in Sadr City suggest that the Iraqi police 
there have not yet turned the corner.  Notably, that 
unhelpful police chief in Sadr City is hanging onto his job 
despite promises that he would be removed.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
IRAQI POLICE LEADERSHIP FAILURES 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (S) During the negotiations for the Sadr City Security 
Agreement outlined in reftel, Colonel Maaruf (Sadr City 
District Iraqi Police Chief) was one of the principal 
obstacles in moving forward and he openly refused to 
support the signing.  Sadr City District Council members, 
to include Ali Saudy and Kudair Alami, pointed to Colonel 
Maaruf as the source of IP intimidation of local political 
leaders.  Most recently, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) 
approved a local curfew in Sadr City beginning on August 5 
to minimize civilian casualties/interference with security 
operations.  Initially, the Ministry chose to use the IP as 
the principal means of disseminating this information.  An 
MOI follow-up of the curfew notification revealed that 
Colonel Maaruf had ordered his stations to stand down 
during the recent fighting, which prevented the message 
from reaching most of the public.  On August 7, the downing 
of a U.S. helicopter occurred near a Sadr City IP station. 
U.S. soldiers observed Colonel Maaruf leading several IP 
units in celebratory fire at the time of the helicopter 
downing.  When the IP station was engaged by JAM members 
shortly after this incident, Colonel Maaruf ordered his 
forces to take refuge in the station and not assist U.S. 
military units in suppressing the JAM gunfire.  To 
underscore the level of collaboration, Chief Rasaq advised 
PolOffs that Colonel Maaruf established a truce with JAM 
that is now in effect. 
 
----------------------------- 
AGREEMENT ON MORE COOPERATION 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (S) Deputy Interior Minister Hekmat and IP Chief Rasaq 
have argued that the IP units in the field are sorely 
outgunned, ill-equipped and poorly trained, while local 
U.S. military commanders have pressed for a greater 
supporting role for the local police in combat operations. 
Following a series of discussions, Deputy Minister Hekmat 
and Police Chief Rasaq agreed to remove Colonel Maaruf from 
office and provide a suitable replacement for him supported 
by Ayatollah Sistani.  In addition, Deputy Minister Hekmat 
called for increased, aggressive sweeps by 1st CAV and the 
Iraqi Police of Sadr City to clear out the JAM.  Chief 
Rasaq pointed out that the National Conference posed a 
significant target for JAM forces in the area; urgent 
action was needed.  Deputy Minister Hekmat proposed that 
such operations should involve cordoning off Sadr City, to 
include the establishment of checkpoints on all seven 
bridges leading into this district. 
 
---------------------- 
PROMISES SO FAR NOT KEPT 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) In the end, however, the Iraqi Police response in 
Sadr City was minimal.  They manned checkpoints at some 
access points to the district.  They did not actively 
participate in any of the 1st CAV clearing operations, 
despite the promises and urgings from the Deputy Interior 
Minister and the Iraqi Police Chief. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (S) We want a greater Iraqi security role in Sadr City 
in order to help promote the legitimacy of Iraqi Government 
entities with Sadr City residents.  Promises from the 
August 11 meeting notwithstanding, the actual conduct of 
operations in Sadr City have been carried out with U.S. 
forces and without much help from local police forces. 
Moreover, Colonel Maaruf still has his job despite promises 
from the Ministry of Interior to remove him.  This is in 
light of new reports of (unspecified) foreign fighters, the 
introduction of more sophisticated weapons -- to include 
surface-to-air missiles -- and daylight attacks on U.S. 
tanks.  This suggests a new vigor in the tempo of JAM 
operations in Baghdad.  If such reports prove true, it will 
be even harder for Coalition Forces to reestablish durable 
security in Sadr City without real cooperation and 
coordination from the Iraqi security forces.

SUBJECT: LOCAL OFFICIALS SHARE VIEWS ON AL-SADR\'S FUTURE 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DRC MATTHEW GOSHKO FOR REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D) 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY: Najaf\'s Governor, the Provincial Council 
Chair and the Governor\'s aide all believe Grand Ayatollah 
al-Sistani\'s intervention in the Najaf crisis has left al- 
Sadr significantly weakened politically.  They further feel 
that the agreement al-Sadr signed has strengthened the 
Iraqi Government\'s ability to move against al-Sadr if the 
Mahdi Militia takes up arms once again.  Council Chair 
Shayk Fayed Kazem al-Shamri also shared an interesting 
analysis of the political make up of the Jaysh al-Mahdi 
movement and the role that certain Iranian interests may 
play in supporting it.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
AL-SADR AND THE JAM\'S POLITICAL FUTURE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (S) Provincial Council Chair Shayk Fa\'ad said the recent 
developments would finish al-Sadr politically and most 
likely lead to a further splintering of the Jaysh al-Mahdi 
movement.  According to Fa\'ad, the Jaysh Al-Mahdi is split 
into three camps: moderates, led by clerics such as Ali 
Sismesom, extremists, led by the likes of Qais al-Khza\'ali, 
and a third group led by ex-Mukhabarat officers from the 
former regime.  While moderates within the movement would 
probably try and join the Dawa party (NOTE: Fa\'ad is a Dawa 
member.  END NOTE), Dawa is unlikely to accept them because 
the group as a whole is tainted by the extremists and ex- 
regime members.  Fa\'ad also noted that it traditionally 
takes years of affiliation, often as much as ten, before an 
individual will be accepted into Dawa\'s full membership, 
let alone leadership.  The reasons for this are historical 
and ideological.  Dawa withheld full admission for long 
periods of time as a defense against infiltration from 
Saddam\'s security and intelligence services.  These long 
waiting periods have led to an organization that is 
politically homogenous.  The Dawa leadership is unlikely to 
accept vocal and active new members whose ideas may differ 
from those of the established leadership.  Fa\'ad speculated 
that some elements of the Jaysh al-Mahdi might be absorbed 
into the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq 
(SCIRI). 
 
3. (S) While it is not uncommon for a Najafi Dawa party 
member to label all things evil as being somehow influenced 
by SCIRI, Fa\'ad actually elaborated on his reasoning. 
Fa\'ad explained that when SCIRI first rose to prominence 
after liberation, there was a schism in the party, and 
within its Badr Corps, over how closely the party should 
remain aligned to Iran.  Prominent clerics like Mohammed 
Bakir al-Hakim sought to maintain a healthy distance from 
Iran. Other members, including Badr Corps commanders such 
as Mahdi Muhandis, wanted to have closer ties with Iran. 
Fa\'ad alleged that individuals like Muhandis had made early 
overtures to the Jaysh al-Mahdi movement and may now look 
to absorb these erstwhile allies, and by extension the 
resources of their Iranian backers, into SCIRI. 
 
--------------------------------- 
MONOLITHIC IRANIAN AGENDA A MYTH? 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (S) The Jasyh al-Mahdi, Fa\'ad said, receive Iranian 
support.  But, he stressed, there are actually three groups 
in Iran that act with different agendas.  These groups are 
the Revolutionary Guards, the Iranian Intelligence Service, 
and President Khatami\'s administration.  These three 
groups, Fa\'ad said, are all afraid of each other and are 
constantly jockeying for advantage.  This maneuvering 
includes backing different players in Iraq, with the Jaysh 
al-Mahdi receiving support from the Revolutionary Guards. 
 
-------------------------- 
WHO FORCED SISTANI\'S HAND? 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (S) Fa\'ad seemed as surprised as everyone that Sistani 
had made the sudden, unannounced return to Najaf.  Fa\'ad 
agrees with the conventional wisdom that Sistani is by 
nature a politically timid man who will not take action 
unless forced to do so.  He noted that none of the 
proposals outlined by Sistani in Basra on August 26 and 
agreed to by al-Sadr was new, having been spelled out by 
various players over the last several months.  Fa\'ad told 
us he had personally visited four times with Sistani\'s son, 
beginning on April 7, to request that Sistani announce 
these proposals with an aim towards disbanding and 
disarming the al-Mahdi Militia.  Fa\'ad was very curious to 
know what, or specifically who, had prompted Sistani to 
move so suddenly. 
 
------------ 
TALAL BILAL: 
------------ 
 
6. (S) Talal Bilal, the Governor\'s aide and close friend, 
shared Fa\'ad\'s assessment that al-Sadr is finished 
politically.  Talal, who was present at the discussion 
site, said that al-Sadr arrived at the meeting, held in a 
house owned by a Hawza member, accompanied by a single aide 
who served as bodyguard and driver.  When asked if al-Sadr 
would take up arms again, Talal pointed to a copy of the 
signed agreement between al-Sadr and Sistani.  Talal said 
that if al-Sadr does violate the agreement, he would be 
pitting himself against the entire Shia world, which, Talal 
intimated, would react strongly to the transgression. 
Governor Zurufi shares Talal\'s assessment that al-Sadr is 
finished politically.  The Governor also agrees that if al- 
Sadr violates the points of the proposal that the 
government will be on much firmer ground to move against 
him. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (S) All three men agree that al-Sadr is finished 
politically.  They also believe his ability to cause 
trouble with his militia has been severely undercut. 
Embassy, however, advises caution in accepting their second 
premise.  Al-Sadr does not enjoy being without influence. 
His political marginalization may actually increase the 
chance he will once again stir up trouble with his militia. 
Embassy notes that al-Sadr has escaped with his skin twice. 
Much will hinge on whether Prime Minister Allawi carries 
out his intent to have the legal action against al-Sadr 
continue.  Furthermore, Embassy does not see evidence that 
the al-Mahdi Militia will be easily or completely disarmed. 
Reports as of August 27, including visual confirmation by 
predator drone, reveal that the al-Mahdi Militia are 
sneaking weapons from the shrine area.  Finally, it can not 
be said conclusively that those fighters who make up the 
majority of the Jasyh al-Mahdi\'s base, mostly unemployed 
and uneducated young men, will feel constrained by 
Sistani\'s opinion. 
 
8. (S) That said, al-Sadr is now deprived of his primary 
trump card--the holy mosques with their religious 
significance and \"citadel\" character that made it difficult 
to use coalition forces to expel the al-Mahdi militia.  He 
has suffered grievous losses among some of his better 
fighting units and was clearly maneuvered into a difficult 
position by the impromptu alliance of secular Shi\'a PM 
Allawi and religious Shi\'a leader Sistani.  If the 
agreement holds this will have significance throughout 
Shi\'a Iraq and beyond.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: IIG SUGGESTS IRAQI GUARDS FOR SADDAM HUSSEIN 
 
Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission James Jeffrey for 
Reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (S) SUMMARY.  Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Barham 
Salih has suggested introducing Iraqi personnel to the 
inner circle of guards watching over Saddam Hussein.  The 
DPM proposed the switch in security personnel in the 
context of his broader expressed interest in destabilizing 
the temperament of the former Iraqi leader prior to trial. 
Deputy Commanding General for Detainee Operations Major 
General Geoffrey Miller expressed skepticism privately as 
to the advisability of this approach.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (S) At a September 13 meeting attended by Deputy Prime 
Minister (DPM) Barham Salih, Deputy Commanding General for 
Detainee Operations Major General Geoffrey Miller, Greg 
Kehoe of the Regime Crimes Liaison Office, and PolMilOff, 
DPM Salih noted that current MultiNational Force-Iraq (MNF- 
I) detention practices pertaining to Saddam Hussein were 
designed to \"keep [Hussein] in a stable condition,\" and 
expressed his concern that keeping Saddam \"too stable\" was 
\"not a good idea.\" 
 
3.  (S) The DPM noted that, when he visited Saddam in his 
prison cell at Camp Cropper the previous week, Saddam 
appeared to react with anger to the presence of Iraqis in 
the prison and that, \"from his hands,\" one could see that 
Saddam was \"controlling himself in rage.\"  The DPM said 
that he and Prime Minister Allawi agreed that changing 
Saddam\'s inner circle of guards (presently staffed by MNF- 
I) to an all-Iraqi guard might provoke a useful reaction 
from Saddam and proposed that he identify ten \"highly 
professional\" Iraqi candidates for these positions. 
 
4.  (S) MG Miller said he thought MNF-I and the IIG \"could 
do this\" and agreed that selecting \"the right kind\" of 
guards would, in this instance, be crucial.  He pointed out 
that Saddam was a \"frustrating\" person with whom to deal, 
being a \"very angry\" and \"fragile\" man, and that any guard 
force, MNF-I or Iraqi, should follow current procedures 
regarding regular duty rotations and a no-weapons policy 
for the innermost circle of guards. 
 
5.  (S) The DPM also expressed the opinion that Saddam 
should be brought to trial in a prison uniform or jumpsuit. 
When it was noted that it is usual practice in Iraqi courts 
for defendants to appear in dress suits, usually brought to 
jailed defendants by their families prior to trial, the DPM 
conceded the point and agreed that standard procedure 
should be followed. 
 
6.  (S) MG Miller remarked that, based on prior experience, 
the application of handcuffs on the day of the trial was in 
itself likely to destabilize Saddam.  He also stated that 
it was important that the court scene \"appear professional\" 
and stressed that, contrary to the DPM\'s concerns, he 
believed it would be difficult to prevent Saddam from 
becoming \"too agitated\" as his trial date approached. 
 
7.  (S) After the meeting, MG Miller privately expressed 
the opinion that MNF-I and IIG strategy should instead 
focus on maintaining Saddam at maximum mental stability for 
trial.  He agreed that some Iraqi participation in guard 
duty was possible but suggested that this would be better 
introduced on a more limited level, perhaps with one Iraqi 
guard paired with an MNF-I guard in two-man teams.  No 
additional visits by IIG officials to Saddam in prison are 
scheduled until after Saddam\'s expected recovery from 
upcoming hernia surgery in October, which will be performed 
at Ibn Sina hospital inside the International Zone on 
September 17.

1. (C) Summary: We have met twice in the past two weeks with 
Shia cleric Saayid Ayad Jamal Ad-Din who warns that the forces 
of ideological and religious extremism will dominate the new 
National Assembly without Coalition support to educated 
moderates and liberals such as himself.  He claimed that despite 
his own personal plea to join with moderates, many 
representatives to Muqtada Al-Sadr have now sided with the 
United Iraqi Alliance and some 25 members are now on this list 
tipping the balance even more for extreme elements of the Shia 
community.  While this cleric says religious parties won\'t fare 
well in the Shia heartland, he himself seems more interested in 
meeting Iraqi communities located in Britain and the U.S.  This 
is especially odd as he has personal stature as a cleric and 
descendent of the prophet that would enable him to raise the 
delicate issue of separating religion and politics in a way that 
other liberal politicians cannot.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Saayid Ayad shared with PolOff on December 21 his concern 
that Iranian intervention is affecting Iraqi internal issues. 
He suggested that Iran is backing major parties like Da\'wa and 
the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), 
providing millions of dollars for media coverage and public 
influence.  Ayad said he had received an invitation to go to 
Iran to meet with Iranian leaders, but after seeing some of his 
interviews on Al-Arabiyya TV attacking Ali Khamanei, the 
Iranians withdrew their offer.  Ayad went on to say that he has 
spent many years overseas arguing for a secular Iraq.  While 
recognizing the sanctity of Islamic beliefs, he felt those 
beliefs should be kept in the private realm, separate from 
politics.  Ayad said he hopes that with additional support, he 
can convey this message to the Iraqi public who he believes 
would welcome this with open arms. 
 
3. (C) Ayad told PolOff that he has joined Iraqi National 
Congress member Saad Saleh Jabor\'s Nation\'s Party list which has 
67 names running for the National Assembly and about 17 names 
for the Provincial Council in Karbala.  Their hope is to capture 
a maximum of 50 seats and no less than 20.  According to Ayad, 
the party is highly dependent on the overseas vote, as many of 
its party members live in exile.  Ayad hopes to appeal to 
overseas Iraqis who want to see a new, democratic Iraq similar 
to the western, largely democratic countries they are now living 
in. 
 
4. (C) According to Ayad, the United Iraqi Alliance list was 
headed towards a significant disappointment in the elections 
until they agreed to allow Muqtada Al-Sadr representatives to 
join the list.  Ayad believes that this decision was approved by 
Ayatollah Sistani himself to bolster the list\'s popularity among 
younger, less educated people.  Ayad explained that most of the 
25 names associated with Muqtada\'s following are relative 
unknowns.  Of these 25 names in the list, he said three are in 
the first ten and ten names are in the first fifty.  Ayad claims 
he obtained this information from a trusted go-between working 
with Muqtada Al-Sadr\'s camp and Mohammed Reda Al-Sistani\'s 
office.  To counter this effort, Ayad said he tried to recruit 
several Muqtada followers to the Nation\'s Party, including 
spokesperson Ali Semaysom.  Semaysom reportedly turned down the 
offer stating that he is not permitted to participate as a 
religious figure himself. 
 
5. (C) Comment: It is interesting to hear a cleric like Ayad 
explain how he has attempted to lure radicals like Ali Semaysom 
to his party with the intent of reducing the overall influence 
of religion in politics.  While he insists that religious 
parties will not fare well in the Shia heartland (he comes from 
Najaf himself), we have no indication he has gone to southern 
Iraq to campaign.  Instead, he told us on December 30 that he 
wants to meet Iraqi communities in Britain and the U.S.  In a 
separate conversation December 30, Jamal Udeen stressed to us 
that the United Iraqi Alliance list will promote religious 
involvement in laws relating to personal and communal conduct as 
well as national politics.  He alleged there is more than 
financial support binding Iran to the religious parties featured 
on the Alliance candidate list.  Jamal Udeen, in some ways, 
would be the ideal liberal politician to raise the delicate 
issue of separating religion from politics.  As a cleric and 
\"sayyed\" - a descendent of the prophet Mohammed - it would be 
harder for Islamists to criticize him as irreligious.  End 
summary.

SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER ZIBARI SAYS IRAQ\'S NEIGHBORS 
SHOULD STOP WORRYING AND START HELPING 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION JAMES F. JEFFREY FOR 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Iraqi Interim Government Foreign Minster 
Zibari told Deputy Secretary Armitage on December 31 that 
Iraq\'s Arab neighbors need to worry less about what the 
Shi\'a will do in Iraq after elections and think about how 
to help convince Iraq\'s Sunni Arabs to stop tearing the 
country apart.  Zibari was firm that Iraqi and Kurdish 
interests require the January elections to go forward 
despite the likelihood of low Sunni voter turnout.  Zibari 
said that more American pressure should be applied to 
Syria, which is still giving too much freedom to former 
regime elements.  Zibari asserted that the Turks exaggerate 
the Kurdish issue but he said that Iraq would send a high- 
level delegation to Ankara to discuss the PKK.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Foreign Minister Zibari received Deputy Secretary 
Armitage, Charge d\'Affaires Jeffrey, Assistant Secretary 
Burns, D staff aide Ryu and Embassy Pol note-taker on the 
evening of December 31 at the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
(KDP) headquarters in the International Zone.  (The Foreign 
Minister was unaccompanied except for his security.) 
Zibari was upbeat, back from what he felt was a good trip 
to China.  He stressed Iraqi appreciation for the American 
administration\'s commitment, praising in particular 
American staying power. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
IRAQ\'S ARAB NEIGHBORS WORRY ABOUT THE SHI\'A 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Zibari stressed that Iraq\'s Arab neighbors are 
nervous about Iraq\'s way forward.  They perceive the Shi\'a 
coming to power and the Sunni Arabs about to be shut out of 
government and the constitution-drafting process.  Zibari 
said that he has explained to the Arab neighbors that Iraq 
will remain an Arab League member and respect its 
obligations.  He has also underlined to them, however, that 
the future Iraqi government will be very different from the 
Saddam regime marked by pan-Arab rhetoric. 
 
4. (C) Zibari said he underlined in Dubai in early December 
that Iraq\'s Shi\'a and Kurds want to work with all Iraqis to 
prepare a good constitution.  Many of Iraq\'s neighbors 
believe the rhetoric of former regime supporters who say 
that they stand for Iraq\'s national unity.  In reality, he 
asserted, it is the Sunni Arabs whose rejectionist stance 
is tearing Iraq apart. 
 
5. (C) Zibari said that the January 6 meeting in Jordan of 
neighboring states would help them understand the Iraqi 
elections.  He noted, for example, that even Jordanian 
Foreign Minister Mulki did not understand how minorities, 
such as Iraq\'s Sunni Arabs, benefit from the Transitional 
Administrative Law\'s (TAL) provision that 2/3 of the voters 
in any three of Iraq\'s governorates could block the new 
constitution.  (COMMENT: Prior to the meeting, Zibari told 
PolCouns that he was not sure either Iranian Foreign 
Minister Kharrazi or Syrian Foreign Minister Shara would 
attend.  He thought King Abdallah\'s remarks about Iran 
might keep the Iranians away.  END COMMENT) 
 
-------------------------- 
SYRIA: NEEDS MORE PRESSURE 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Zibari told the Deputy Secretary that charges of 
Syrian complicity in Iraq\'s security problems from 
officials like Iraqi Defense Minister Sha\'lan add to Syrian 
concerns.  Zibari perceived that overall, however, the 
Syrians think the U.S. lacks staying power in Iraq, just as 
it lacked it in Lebanon 20 years ago.  Syria aims to be an 
arbiter of Iraqi affairs, he claimed.  Thus, it provides 
far broader freedom to former regime elements in terms of 
money transfers, training and media access than it ever 
granted to the anti-Saddam opposition before.  He urged 
greater U.S. pressure on Damascus.  For example, he 
suggested the U.S. begin helping the Syrian opposition, a 
step he claimed would immediately gain Syrian Government 
attention and modify its behavior. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
TURKEY: DO NOT EXAGGERATE KURDISH ISSUES 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Zibari said that bilateral relations with Turkey are 
\"going well,\" although he acknowledged ongoing Turkish 
worries about Kurdish independence.  Zibari stressed that 
the Turks ultimately understand that independence is not on 
the agenda of the Iraqi Kurds\' leadership.  Occasional 
developments do \"agitate\" the Turks, such as the referendum 
on Kurdish independence.  Zibari also acknowledged Turkish 
concerns about Kirkuk.  Keeping the current provincial 
council would help allay those Turkish worries as there are 
Turkmen sitting on the council, a fact that reassures the 
Turks. 
 
8. (C) Zibari asserted that the PKK is largely shutdown and 
that the Turkish-Iraq border has been quiet in recent 
years.  He acknowledged that there have been some incidents 
but he said the Turks should not exaggerate their 
importance.  He added that the Turkish Government has 
intelligence operatives and Special Forces in northern Iraq 
and understands the reality on the ground.  Zibari stated 
that the Interim Iraqi Government policy is clear; Iraq 
will not harbor any terror group on its soil.  Zibari said 
an interagency Iraqi team will go to Ankara in January to 
discuss the PKK.  That said, he said the Turkish Government 
must understand that the Iraqi Government\'s biggest 
priority now is not the PKK. 
 
-------------------------------- 
KURDS MUST SUPPORT THE ELECTIONS 
-------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Zibari, who is close to Kurdish KDP leader Masud 
Barzani, dismissed the Kurdish threat to boycott the 
January elections because of Kurdish dissatisfaction with 
the situation in Kirkuk.  Kurds should not let themselves 
be seen as obstacle, he opined.  Moreover, such a boycott 
would hurt the credibility of the elections and hurt the 
Kurds\' friends in the U.S.  The suggestion put forward of 
keeping a provincial council along the lines of the current 
council is not a permanent solution, but it puts the issue 
off past elections.  Zibari concluded that the January 
elections may be messy at times, but they must go forward. 
Deputy Secretary agreed, noting that the U.S. and Iraq have 
started down a path.  Too many Iraqi lives have been 
sacrificed to change that path now.  The U.S., he strongly 
reiterated to Zibari, will not change its stance on 
elections. 
 
----------------------------- 
INTERNATIONAL MONITORS USEFUL 
----------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Zibari opined that the Shi\'a United Alliance list 
is strong but he doubted that it would gain 60-65 percent 
of the vote as many think.  Zibari anticipated there would 
be a strong Kurdish turnout.  Looking at the Sunni Arab 
vote, Zibari stated that the Sunnis want to vote; however, 
he anticipated that the voter turnout would not be large 
because of the intimidation campaign.  In addition, none of 
the lists had garnered much Sunni Arab enthusiasm.  The 
resulting Sunni Arab apathy would keep many voters home in 
the face of the risk associated with voting.  Zibari said 
that, while the Sunni Arab vote would be low, the rest of 
Iraqis would vote in big numbers.  It would be useful to 
have international monitors in Iraq to see how open the 
process is and how good the turnout will be.

SUBJECT: BAGHDAD PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR\'S ASSASSINATION SHAKES 
THE CAPITAL 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR ROBERT S. FORD FOR 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Baghdad Provincial Governor Ali Radhi al- 
Haidary was assassinated on January 4, in the eighth 
attempt on his life since he assumed office in June, 2004. 
Assailants in three vehicles attacked the Governor\'s 
motorcade after he left his office in Baghdad\'s Mansour 
District.  He was seriously wounded in the ensuing gun 
battle, and died shortly afterward at a local hospital. 
This most recent attack underlines the heightened state of 
insecurity in the capital, and reaffirms to all officials 
the real nature of their vulnerability.  It comes as some 
political party leaders are stating an unwillingness to 
campaign in large portions of Baghdad for fear of violence, 
and as the Baghdad Provincial Council, which elected al- 
Haidary Governor last summer, has not met for two weeks due 
to threats.  Baghdad\'s Regional Council, which covers the 
Province\'s rural areas, was scheduled to elect a new Deputy 
Governor on January 5, to replace Deputy Governor Hatem 
Kamil, who was killed in a similar ambush-style attack in 
November 2004.  Should this election proceed as planned, 
according to the Provincial Charter passed by the Councils 
in July, 2004, the new Deputy Governor would become acting 
Governor of Baghdad.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Ali Radhi al-Haidary, an engineer by profession, 
began his local government career in May 2003 when he 
attended a neighborhood caucus organized by the Baghdad 
Mayoralty and the Coalition.  During this caucus fellow 
citizens to the Adil Neighborhood Council elected him.  The 
Neighborhood Council subsequently elected him to the 
Mansour District Council, and the District Council voted to 
send him to the City Council.  Al-Haidary served as 
Chairman of the City Council from December 2003 to February 
2004.  During his tenure, he extended the Council\'s staff 
and led a Baghdad delegation to Japan, where they met with 
Prime Minister Koizumi. 
 
3. (U) Al-Haidary was a leading candidate for Mayor of 
Baghdad in the selection held in April 2004, garnering 
support from both Shi\'a and Sunni City Council members. 
However, he dramatically withdrew at the last moment, and 
subsequently campaigned for and was elected by the 
Provincial Council to be Governor in June 2004.  As 
Governor he focused on finding funding and facilities for 
the provincial government and building up its nascent 
administrative system in the face of the insurgency and 
extensive lawlessness gripping the province. 
 
4. (U) Al-Haidary was a 48-year-old Shi\'a Arab.  He held a 
BA in Mechanical Engineering and an MBA.  He was director 
of the al-Timsaah (Alligator) Paint Company from 1983 to 
2003, and was selected in September 2003 by the new 
Minister of Education to be a special advisor on financial 
and management issues.  In addition to his residence in the 
Mansour district, he had a small farm on the outskirts of 
Baghdad, where he three times won Baghdad Province prizes 
for best crops.  He is survived by a wife and two children. 
 
------------------------------- 
A FREQUENT ASSASSINATION TARGET 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Al-Haidary had been attacked seven times in the 
seven months that he was Governor.  Two Iraqi police 
officers were killed in these attacks and several security 
guards were wounded.  His first armored car was destroyed 
by an IED.  In a conversation with Embassy staff on January 
3, the day before his death, the Governor remarked that out 
of concern for his family, if he were attacked again, he 
would \"leave the country and never look back\". 
 
6. (C) On January 4, according to initial Iraqi Police 
Service (IPS) reports, three AIF vehicles ambushed the 
Governor\'s three-car convoy when it left his office in West 
Baghdad\'s Mansour District.  Two blocked the path of the 
lead vehicle, an unarmored BMW in which he was traveling 
(NOTE: This is unusual, as the U.S. Army First Cavalry 
Division rents an armored BMW for the Governor\'s use, and 
principals rarely ride in the lead vehicle.  The Governor 
may have been trying to throw off his potential assassins. 
However, in earlier assassinations (see below) the 
attackers seemed to know to stage their attack when the 
principal was atypically riding in an unarmored car.  END 
NOTE) The AIF vehicles began firing on the lead vehicle, 
while a third car pulled along side and engaged the two 
follow cars, SUVs.  The Governor\'s personal security detail 
(PSD) returned fire and a gun battle ensued.  Reportedly 
the Governor was rushed to nearby Yarmouk Hospital, where 
he died of his wounds at approximately 1030 local time. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
IIG MIXED MESSAGES ON SECURITY SUPPORT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Post had sought suitable housing for the Governor in 
the Green Zone/International Zone since CPA days.  While 
the Governor had briefly used two rooms at the al-Rasheed 
Hotel, his family faced difficulties in accessing the zone, 
and he chose to remain with them at his residence in the 
Adil neighborhood.  After months of urging, the Iraqi 
Interim Government (IIG) finally recognized the need to 
address the Governor\'s safety concerns.  On December 27, 
Interim Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Barham Salih and the 
Interim Prime Minister\'s Chief of Staff Zuhair signed a 
letter authorizing the Governor to use a private home in 
the International Zone.  Governor al-Haidary told PolOff on 
December 30, however, that when he attempted to take 
possession of the house Ministry of Defense (MoD) Inspector 
General Layla Jassim rebuffed him and approximately 60 
armed Iraqi National Guardsmen (ING).  He said the MoD IG 
claimed ownership of the property and tore the DPM\'s letter 
to shreds.  The Governor told PolOff that he left after 
being physically threatened by the IG and ING. 
 
---------------------- 
FINDING A NEW GOVERNOR 
---------------------- 
 
8. (C) The Baghdad Regional Council, which represents the 
areas of the province outside the city limits, is slated to 
meet on January 5 to elect a new Deputy Governor.  The 
former Deputy, Hatem Kamal, also a close CPA and Embassy 
contact, was assassinated in a November 2004 vehicular 
ambush similar to the attack on Governor al-Haidary.  The 
Regional Council leadership has advised EmbOffs for several 
months that they are concerned for their own safety.  They 
have been meeting at various locations that remain 
unannounced until immediately beforehand.  If the Regional 
Council leadership decides to go ahead with their January 5 
meeting despite al-Haidary\'s assassination, and if they 
both have a quorum and elect a new Deputy Governor as 
scheduled, then the new Deputy Governor they choose would 
serve as acting Governor of Baghdad Province.  If this does 
not occur, then the Provincial Council (which covers the 
whole province) might elect an interim Governor to serve on 
an emergency basis until after the January 30 elections. 
(NOTE: In accordance with the Charters adopted by the 
Baghdad Councils in June 2004, the councils at all levels 
utilize competitive, transparent search procedures to fill 
executive positions; it would normally take 4-6 weeks for 
the public announcement, search committee work, and 
selection meetings for the Provincial Council to choose a 
new, permanent governor.  With elections in less then a 
month there is not sufficient time to do that.  END NOTE) 
 
----------------------- 
WIDENING CIRCLE OF FEAR 
----------------------- 
 
9. (C) Executive branch officials like Kamil and al-Haidary 
are only the most prominent Baghdad provincial leaders at 
risk in an intensifying terrorist campaign.  In response to 
explicit threats and continuing attacks, the members of the 
Baghdad Provincial Council have chosen to cancel their 
meetings for the last two weeks.  The Chairman of the 
Provincial council told PolOff on January 4 that he is 
being surveilled and is taking precautions by shifting his 
residence periodically.  The Chairman is also a 
representative of the Baghdad Independent Citizens\' 
Gathering, a newly formed party mostly composed of council 
members.  He said the group will not be able to campaign in 
Mansour, or in the southern district of Rasheed because of 
the threat level.  In the Governor\'s final conversation 
with Embassy FSN, he warned her to be careful; that the AIF 
is especially tracking all females working for the USG. 
 
10. (C) COMMENT: Many Embassy employees and former CPA 
officials working in Baghdad had come to know and respect 
Governor al-Haidary as a colleague and friend.  His 
commitment to democracy, personal bravery and his practical 
approach to the difficult tasks ahead were an inspiration 
to many.  Al-Haidary\'s assassination follows the slaying 
not only of Deputy Governor Hatim, but also of Deputy Mayor 
Faris abd al-Razzak, three District Council Chairpersons 
and an estimated 26 Baghdad Council members at all levels 
over the past 14 months.  With elections less than a month 
away, the murder of Governor al-Haidary will further 
disturb an already terrorized local administration.  In 
conjunction with all the other attacks, it will have a 
further chilling effect on candidates and election workers. 
It demonstrates that even the most tenacious public 
official -- willing to withstand seven assassination 
attempts -- will eventually be killed by terrorists or 
driven away.  The Governor\'s killing appears to have been 
meant by the insurgents to demonstrate to the seven million 
citizens of Baghdad province that even the most heavily- 
protected local official is not safe, that the Coalition 
and the IIG cannot ensure security, and that anyone is 
within the insurgents\' reach.  Although we have not seen a 
claim of responsibility for the Governor\'s assassination, 
the modus operandi of the killers was similar to that used 
to kill the Deputy Governor, whose murder was later claimed 
by the insurgent group Ansar al-Sunna.  END COMMENT.
