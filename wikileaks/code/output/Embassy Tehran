COUNTRY TEAM. MESSAGE 
 
 
BEGIN SUMMARY 
 
GENERAL AZIMI, MINISTER OF WAR, ON INSTRUCTION OF SHAH ASKS THAT WE TAKE ANOTHER HARD LOOK AT F-4E PRODUCTION LINE IN ORDER ACCELERATE DELIVERY OF ONE SQUADRON OF F-4ES TO IRAN IN 1972. REQUEST REFLECTS SHAH\'S INCREASING CONCERN OVER SOVIET AMBITIONS IN AREA AND ESPECIALLY THREAT SHAH SEES TO IRAN OF FRIENDSHIP TREATY UNDER CONSIDERATION BY IRAQ AND USSR. SHAH RECOGNIZES PROBLEMS THIS POSES FOR US BUT IS TURNING TO USG WITH THIS REQUEST TO GIVE IRAN HIGHER PRIORITY ON FA-4E PRODUCTION SCHEDULE BECAUSE HE REGARDS US AS MOST DEPENDABLE FRIEND. END SUMMARY 
 
ACTION REQUESTED: COUNTRY TEAM RECOMMENDS US REVIEW F-4E PRODUCTION LINE AND RESPOND FAVORABLY TO SHAH\'S REQUEST FOR 16 F-4ES IN 1972 FROM WHATEVER SOURCE MAY BE AVAILABLE. 
 
1. ON FEB 24 CHARGE WAS CONVOKED BY MINSTER OF WAR, GEN. REZANUZIMI, ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM SHAH. AZIMI SAID SHAH MOST DEEPLY CONCERNED AT TRENDS IN SECURITY SITUATION IN MIDDLE EAST AND EXPECIALLY ON HIS WESTERN BORDERS. US OFFICALS ALREADY AWARE OF SHAH\'S CONCERN THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER AND OTHER GOI OFFICIALS (SEE REFTELS), BUT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ SOVIET RELATIONS INCLUDING AGREEMENT TO DELIVER MORE MIGS AND OTHER MILITARY EQUIPMENT PLUS INDICATION THAT RECENT IRAQI-SOVIET TALKS IN MOSCOW INCLUDED CONSIDERATION OF FRIENDSHIP TREATY AS WELL AS INCREASED MILITARY COOPERATION INJECT NEW SENSE OF URGENCY IN SHAH\'S TIMETABLE FOR MODERNINZING AND STRENTHENING HIS ARMED FORCES. MOST SPECIFICALLY, SITUATION REQUIRED IRAN ACCELERATE ITS MILITARY PROCUREMENT AND HOST PARTICULARLY DELIVERY OF F-4E AIRCRAFT. 
 
2. AZIMI RECALLED THAT GOI HAD REQUESTED DELIVERY OF 16 OF F-4E AIRCRAFT NOW ON ORDER BY IRAN (FIRST OF WHICH WAS NOT SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY UNTIL AUGUST 1973) BE ADVANCED TO CY 1972. HOWEVER, GOI HAD RECENTLY BEEN INFORMED BY USG AND MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS THAT PRODUCTION LINE FOR IRAN COULD NOT RPT NOT BE ADVANCED TO MEET 1972 DELIVERY DATES DESIRED. SHAH WAS MOST DISTURBED, AS ADDITION OF F-4ES IN 1972 WAS VITAL TO IRAN\'S SECURITY AT THIS TIME. SHAH HAD DIRECTED THAT USG BE ASKED, IF PRODUCTION FOR IRAN COULD NOT IN FACT BE ADVANCED, TO MAKE REQUESTED F-4ES AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. SHAH\'S DESIRE IS FOR DELIIVERY OF F-4FS IN LOTS OF FOUR DURING JUNE TO DECEMBER TIME-FRAME. 
 
3. CHARGE REVIEWED RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN US-IRAN MILITARY COOPERATION, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT AND CREDIT, AND STRESSED THAT RECORD INDICATED WE UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED SHAH\'S CONCERNS AND DESIRES AND HAD BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY RESPONSIVE TO SHAH\'S WISHES. CURRENTLY, AZIMI\'S DEPUTY GEN. TOUFANS, WAS IN US DISCUSSING VERY QUESTION OF ACCLERATED EQUIPMENT ACQUISIION INCLUDING F-4E. ACCELERATION OF F-4E DELIVERY RAISED DIFFICULT TECHNICAL AND COST PROBLEMS AS WELL AS QUESTIONS OF OTHER COMMITMENTS AND PRIORITIES. UNDOUBTEDLY THESE ISSUES WERE BEING DISCUSSED IN FULL WITH GEN. TOUFANIAN TO ENSURE THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY INFORMED OF POSSIBILITIES AND PROBLEMS AND REASONS FOR ANY LIMITATIONS ON MEETING GOI REQUEST THAT MIGHT EXIST. GEN. TOUFANIAN PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FULLER PICTURE OF SITUATION THAN WE NOW HAD IN IRAN. 
 
4. AZIMI RESPONDED THAT GOI WAS BEING KEPT INFORMED OF TOUFANIAN DISCUSSIONS, BUT DECISON ON F-4E COULD NOT BE DELAYED. AZIMI MADE CLEAR SHAH FELT AQUISITION OF 16 F-4E AIRCRAFT IN 1972 WAS MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE MILITARY PROBLEM OUTSTANDING. HE STRESSED SHAH BELIEVED THAT NUMBER REQUIRED WAS SMALL IN RELATION TO US INVENTORY, AND THAT UNSETTLED SITUATION CONFRONTING IRAN WARRANTED ACCELERATED DELIVERY TO IRAN AS AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE DISPOSITIONS (AS TO EUROPE OR EVEN USAF) IN SAME TIME FRAME. 
 
5. CHARGE NOTED WE WOULD TRANSMIT SHAHS REQUEST TO, WASHINGTON AND THAT USG IN SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP WHICH MARKED OUR RELATIONS WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO BE RESPONSIVE. CHARGE SAID THIS SAME FRIENDSHIP REQUIRED HIM TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT ALTHOUGH WE WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MEET SHAH\'S NEEDS AS SHAH SAW THEM, OUR MILITARY ADVISERS, AS GOI KNEW, WERE CONCERNED THAT ACCELERATION OF AIRCRAFT ACQUISITION WOULD STRAIN SUPPORT AND OPERATIONAL MANPOWER OF IIAF AND COULD LEAD TO DECREASE RATHER THAN INCREASE IN IIAF EFFECTIVENESS. AZIMI REPLIED THAT NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT TO BE DELIVERED HAD BEEN, CLOSELY STUDIED BY IlAF WITH MAAG ASSISTANCE, AND IIAF WAS SATISFIED THAT SIXTEEN AIRCRAFT REQUESTED COULD BE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED INTO PRESENT FORCE STRUCTURE. AZIMI CLOSED MEETING BY ASKING THAT USG ANSWER SHAH\'S REQUEST AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. 
 
6. COMMENT. SHAH IS DEEPLY CONCERN AT DEVELOPMENTS OVER PAST YEARS STRENGTHENING SOVIET INFLUENCE AND PRESENCE IN MIDEAST AND INDIAN OCEAN AND APPEARING TO INDICATE SUBSTANTIALLY ENLARGED SOVIET COMMITMENT, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY, TO IRAQ. HE HAS CONCLUDED THAT INCREASED PRESENT DANGER REQIRES IRAN\'S FIRST LINE AIR DEFENSE TO BE BEEFED-UP NOW RATHER THAN IN PREVIOUSLY PROGRAMMED SCHEDULE STARTING IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THE NUMBER, FREQUENCY AND TONE OF DEMARCHES ON SUBJECT WE HAVE RECEIVED IS VIRTUALLY UNPARALLELLED, AND CAN LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT HIM CONSIDERS ISSUE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE. 
 
7. WHETHER WE FULLY AGREE WITH SHAH\'S CONCERN, WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT REQUEST --LIKE USG DECISION IN 1970 ON SALE TO IRAN OF SEVENTH AND EIGHTH SQUADRONS OF F-4E --HAS BECOME ANOTHER GUT ISSUE IN SHAH\'S MIND. SHAH IS AGAIN TURNING TO USG BECAUSE IN PERIODS OF ANXIETY SHAH FEELS HE CAN LOOK TO US FOR COOPERATION AND HE HOPES THAT US AS RELIABLE FRIEND WILL FIND CHANCE BE RESPONSIVE ON MATTER HE CONSIDERS IMPORTANT AND VITAL TO IRAN\'S SECURITY. THUS USG CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST MUST RECOGNIZE THAT DECISION INVOLVES UNUSUAL DEGREE OF POLITICAL IMPORTANCE RELATED TO FABRIC OF USG-GOI RELATIONS. DECISION SHOULD ALSO NOT OVERLOOK OR UNDERESTIMATE IMPORTANCE OF IRAN FOR VITAL US NATIONAL INTERESTS. 
 
8. ACTION REQUESTED. COUNRY TEAM URGES THAT USG GIVE PROMPT AND SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION TO SHAH\'S REQUEST FOR 1972 DELIVERY OF F-4E AIRCRAFT, FROM WHATEVER SOURCES MAY BE AVAILABLE TO BE TAPPED (INCLUDING DELIVERIES TO USAF). WE RECOGNIZE THAT REQUEST MAY RAISE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS, BUT URGE THAT EVERY AVENUE BE EXPLORED TO REACH POSITIVE RESPONSE. IT IS ALSO MOST IMPORTANT THAT COUNTRY TEAM BE KEPT FULLY INFORMED OF PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS TO ENABLE US CONTINUE TO MEET AND TEMPER SENSE OF URGENCY ON SUBJECT WHICH PREVAILS WITHIN GOI. IF DELAYS OR BARRIERS TO FULLY FAVORABLE RESPONSE MATERIALIZE, WE TRUST THAT EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO BE AS FORTHCOMING AS POSSIBLE (E.G. PARTIAL DELIVERY IN 1972) AND THAT PERSUASIVE RATIONALE CAN BE DEVELOPED TO FULLY EXPLAIN TO SHAH REASONS FOR ANY SHORTCOMING. IN ORDER TO DIMINISH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE NEGATIVE IMPACT.

SUBJECT: TRIALS/EXECUTIONS OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT ELEMENTS: STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE AND SHAH LASHES OUT AT FOREIGN CRITICS 
 
1. IN PROTEST AGAINST RECENT TRIALS/PUNISHMENT (PARTICULARLY EXECUTIONS, WHICH NOW TOTAL 10) OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT-ELEMENTS, TEHRAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS -- LEAD BY FACULTY OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS-- MOUNTED ON-CAMPUS DEMONSTRATION AFTERNOON OF MARCH 7 AND EVEN LARGE ONE (CIRC 600) MORNING OF MARCH 8. WHILE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION FELT CAPABLE OF HANDLING MARCH 7 DEMONSTRATION WITHOUT HELP OF OUTSIDE POLICE, THEY APPARENTLY FELT UNABLE DO SO MARCH 8 AND CALLED NATIONAL POLICE ONTO CAMPUS FOR BRIEF PERIOD. RESULT WAS MUCH MANHANDLING OF STUDENTS BUT THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF ANY SERIOUS CASUALTIES/CLASHES, AND UNIVERSITY WAS QUIET BY EARLY AFTERNOON. 
 
2. SOME FACULTIES AT OTHER TEHRAN UNIVERSITIES (E.G. ARYAMEHR, NATIONAL AND POLYTECHNIC) ARE REPORTED TO HAVE ENGAGED IN SYMPATHY STRIKES\" MARCH 8 BUT SO FAR NO DEMONSTRATIONS REPORTED* THERE IS RELIABLE REPORT THAT DEMONSTRATIONS BY STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITY OF MESHED (SIX OF 10 EXECUTED CAME FROM MESHED AREA) BECAME SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT UNIVERSITY WAS CLOSED THREE DAYS AGO AND STILL REMAINS CLOSED. (COMMENT: WE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF GOI ORDERS TEHRAN UNIVERSITIES CLOSED UNTIL AFTER NO RUZ HOLIDAY.) 
 
3. FROM COMMENTS OF STUDENTS AND OBSERVERS CLOSE TO ACADEMIC CIRCLES, IT SEEMS CLEAR LARGE PART OF MOTIVATION FOR DEMONSTRATION AND SYMPATHY STRIKES  IS STUDENT ANGER OVER GOI\'S CONTINUED DETENTION OF SEVERAL STUDENTS AS \"ANTI-STATE\" SUBVERSIVES AND, EVEN MORE, ANGER OVER RECENT TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS OF THOSE CONVICTED OF ANTI-STATE ACTIVITIES. THERE ARE ALREADY INDICATIONS, HOWEVER, THAT GOI CONSIDERS TIMING OF DEMONSTRATIONS (PERHAPS DEMONSTRATIONS THEMSELVES) PROMOTED BY ANTI-STATE ELEMENTS TO EMBARRASS GOI DURING VISIT OF CHANCELLOR BRANDT AND HIS CONSIDERABLE PRESS RETINUE. 
 
4. IN RELATED DEVELOPMENT, WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN INTENDED FOR EARS OF STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS AND THEIR SYMPATHIZERS SHAH LASHED OUT STRONGLY IN MARCH 7 PRESS CONFERENCE (WITH GERMAN PRESSMEN) AT WHAT HE LABELLED DISTORTED FOREIGN REPORTING ABOUT TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS. HIM HIT AT LE MONDE VIGOROUSLY AND REPEATEDLY, AND TOOK PARTICULAR EXCEPTION TO LE MONDE\'S APPEAL FOR CLEMENCY FOR THOSE CONVICTED IN RECENT TRIALS. AFTER ASKING TWO RHETORICAL QUESTIONS \"HAS LE MONDE EVER ASKED WHETHER THESE MURDERERS HAVE RIGHT TO TAKE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE? HAS LE MONDE EVER WRITTEN ONE WORD OF CONDEMNATION AGAINST TERRORISTS AND ASSASSINS SENT BY IRA TO EXTERMINATE PEOPLE?\"), SHAH SAID FOREIGN PRESS HAS NO RIGHT GIVE ADVICE ON MATTERS THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. HE RECALLED HIS \"CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY\" NOT TO PERMIT \"TERROR OR ATTEMPTS AGAINST MY COUNTRY\'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY BY AGENTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.\"

SUBJECT: CONTINUING TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN IRAN 
 
REF: TEHRAN\'S A-077 OF MAY 15, 1972: TEHRAN 3312 
 
SUMMARY: TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN IRAN SEEM TO BE INCREASING INSTEAD OF USUAL SUMMER SUBSIDENCE DUE TO VACATION FOR STUDENTS, PERHAPS INDICATING BETTER ORGANIZATION AND BROADENING OF APPEAL TO NON-STUDENT GROUPS. VIGOROUS ANTI-GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN ON PART OF IRANIAN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS IS NETTING NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS BUT HARSH GOI POLICY APPARENTLY UNABLE BRING GUERRILLAS UNDER CONTROL AND MAY IN FACT BE HARDENING ATTITUDES OF GUERRILLAS AND THEIR SYMPATHIZERS. WHILE TERRORIST GROUPS NOT YET THREAT TO REGIME, GOI UNLIKELY SUCCEED IN HALTING THEIR ACTIVITIES WITHOUT FIRST ADDRESSING BASIC QUESTION OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS. 
END SUMMARY 
 
1. DESPITE CONTINUING LARGE-SCALE CAMPAIGN ON PART OF GOI SECURITY ORGANS, URBAN GUERRILLAS ARE MAINTAINING RATE OF ACTIVITY. DURING PAST FOUR MONTH PERIOD THERE HAVE BEEN 28 CONFIRMED EXPLOSIONS (11 OF WHICH DIRECTED AGAINST US PRESENCE), TEN SHOOTOUTS AND SEVERAL OTHER INCIDENTS INCLUDING UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP DAUGHTER OF COURT MINISTER ALAM, AND PLOT TO SABOTAGE ISFAHAN STEEL MILL. OTHER UNCONFIRMED INCIDENTS REPORTED ON ALMOST DAILY BASIS. 
 
2. IRANIAN SECURITY ORGANS, INCLUDING SAVAEEEAAA GENDARMERIE AND LOCAL POLICE, REACTING VIGOROUSLY AND WITH HEAVY HAND. DURING SAME PERIOD AT LEAST 16 GUERRILLAS KILLED IN CONFRONTATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES, 13 OTHERS ANNOUNCED EXECUTED, TEN SENTENCED TO DEATH BUT REPRIEVED AND SENTENCE TO LIFE IN PRISON, NINE OTHERS GIVEN LIFE, AND 39 CONVICTED AND GIVEN SENTENCES RANGING FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS. ALL OF ABOVE TRIED BY MILITARY TRIBUNALS, AND MAJLES HAS RECENTLY PASSED LAW PROVIDING SPECIFICALLY THAT ALL THOSE ENGAGING IN ACTS OF SABOTAGE WILL BE TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WITH POSSIBLE SENTENCES RANGING FROM ONE YEAR TO DEATH. GOI HAS COMMITTED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES TO SO FAR UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO CONTROL TERRORISTS--FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF OFFICERS NORMALLY DETAILED TO WORK WITH BNDD AGENTS ON NARCOTICS MATTERS HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED TO GUERRILLA PROBLEM. 
 
3. IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED IN TEHRAN THAT URBAN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS INCREASING AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT A GREATER NUMBER OF INCIDENTS ARE BEING REPORTED IN THE CONTROLLED LOCAL MEDIA. BUT INCREASED RAPPORTAGE, WHICH MAY RESULT AS MUCH FROM REPUTED PRESSURE FROM LOCAL PRESSMEN ON GOI AS FROM CONTINUING GOVERNMENT DESIRE TO EXPLOIT LESS SAVORY ASPECTS OF GUERRILLA OPERATIONS DOES NOT COVER ALL INCIDENTS INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED BY EMBASSY LET ALONE THE MANY GUERRILLA ACTIVITY WHICH ARE RUMORED BUT NOT CONFIRMED. MOREOVER FREQUENCY OF UNCONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAS INCREASED BY A FACTOR AT LEAST AS GREAT AS THAT OF THOSE GIVEN MEDIA COVERAGE, LEADING TO PRESUMPTION THAT STEPPED UP TERRORIST ACTIVITY IS A REALITY AND NOT A RESULT OF INSPIRED PUBLICITY. PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN INCREASED GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS FACT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF INCIDENTS HAS CONTINUED INTO SUMMER WHEN STUDENTS, WHO HAVE IN PAST PROVIDED BULK OF RECRUITS FOR GUERRILLAS, DISPERSED FOR VACATIONS. THIS MAY MEAN THAT UNDERGROUND MOVEMENTS ARE BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND ARE CATCHING ON WITH NON-STUDENT GROUPS, WHICH IF TRUE, WOULD HEIGHTEN DIFFICULTY OF PENETRATING AND CONTROLLING GUERRILLA GROUPS. 
 
4. DESPITE GOI APPARENT INABILITY TO SUPPRESS GUERRILLAS, EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT TERRORISTS AT PRESENT CONSTITUE AN IRRITANT AND EMRARRASSMENT BUT POSE NO THREAT TO REGIME. HOWEVER, IT IS APPARENT TO US, AGAIN VERY TENTATIVELY, THAT GOI TACTICS OF HARSH REPRESSION AGAINST GUERRILLAS ARE NOT WORKING VERY WELL AND MAY PROVOKE SNOWBALL EFFECT OF ACTION AND REACTION PART OF SAVAK TERRORISTS, LEADING TO BROADENING RESENTMENT AMONG POPULACE AGAINST SAVAK PERVASIVENESS AND TACTICS. EVENTUALLY REGIME WILL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS RESPONSIVE TO AT LEAST SOME OF THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMPLAINTS WHICH FORM BASES OF GUERRILLA DISSATISFACTION. WE DO NOT ENUMMERATE THESE COMPLAINTS HERE, PARTIALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY FORMED AND DEFINED IN OUR OWN MINDS OR EVEN, PERHAPS IN THE MINDS OF THE TERRORISTS THEMSELVES. MOREOVER, TERRORIST MOVEMENT IS NOT IDEOLOGICALLY OR ORGANIZATIONALLY UNIFIED AND NATURE OF THEIR COMPLAINTS VARIES FROM GROUP TO GROUP. WE SHALL BE EXAMINING FURTHER AND REPORTING ON THESE AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT. MEANWHILE, WITHOUT SOUNDING ANY ALARM BELLS, THIS MESSAGE IS INTENDED TO ALERT THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE URBAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN IRAN CONTINUES TO BE A FACT OF LOCAL POLITICAL LIFE WHICH BEARS CONTINUING SCRUTINY. 
 
5. THE U.S. PRESENCE IN IRAN, WHILE TARGETED BY THE TERRORISTS, IS NOT THEIR PRIMARY TARGET AND SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE SUCH AS PRESIDENT NIXON\'S MAY VISIT (SEE REFTEL) OR THE JANUARY SAVAK TV SHOW WHICH PRECEDE LAST SPRING\'S SHOW TRIALS HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO BRING ON BOMBINGS AT AMERICAN INSTALLATIONS. WE ARE CONTINUING ALL REASONABLE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS.

SUBJECT: CONTINUING TERRORIST VIOLENCE 
 
REF: TEHRAN 4887 
 
SUMMARY: FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION OF GENERAL SAID TAHERI, BOMBING AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE. SAVAK MAINTAINING ITS POLICY OF WIDESPREAD PREVENTIVE ARRESTS AND, WHILE THIS RUNS RISK OF HEIGHTENING RESENTMENT AMONG POPULACE, OFFICIALS SEEM CONFIDENT THAT GUERRILLAS ARE ON THE RUN. WE ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE OFFICIAL OPTIMISM AND FEEL THAT SANGUINE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND THE GUERRILLA REACTION THEY USUALLY PROVOKE MAY FURTHER ERODE CREDIBILITY OF SECURITY ORGANS IN MIND OF PUBLIC. 
END SUMMARY 
 
1. IN WAKE OF SMOOTHLY HANDLED ASSASSINATION AUGUST 13 OF HEAD OF PRISONS BRIGADIER GENERAL SAID TAHERI (REFTEL) WHO WAS ALSO CHIEF OF AN ANTI-GUERRILLA SUBCOMMITTEE WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, FREQUENCY OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAS INCREASED. RECENT CONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAVE INCLUDED A BOMB IN A TEHRAN DEPARTMENT STORE WHICH INJURED THE TERRORIST PLANTING IT, BOMB IN TEHRAN NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY BUILDING WHICH KILLED WATCHMAN, APPREHENSION OF A TERRORIST IN SOUTH TEHRAN WHICH RESULTED IN ONE KILLED AND FIVE WOUNDED, AND SHOOTING TO DEATH OF THREE POLICEMEN IN A SMALL BAZAAR IN SOUTH TEHRAN. NUMEROUS OTHER BOMBINGS AND SHOOTINGS RUMORED BUT NOT VERIFIED BY EMBASSY OR CONFIRMED BY GOI. 
 
2. SAVAK AND OTHER SECURITY ORGANS ARE PROCEEDING WITH A WIDESPREAD AND, WE HEAR, NOT VERY WELL TARGETED ROUND-UP OF SUSPECTS, AIDED BY LISTS OF NAMES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FOUND IN DWELLING OF A RECENTLY SLAIN TERRORIST LEADER. POLICE NETS, WHICH ARE REPORTEDLY HAULING IN THE INNOCENT WITH THE GUILTY, HAVE EXTENDED AS FAR AFIELD AS ISFAHAN WHERE A NUMBER OF SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED TWO WEEKS AGO. 
 
3. DESPITE INCREASING LEVEL OF GUERRILLA ACTIVITY, POLICE OFFICIALS REMAIN OPTIMISTIC. CHIEF OF NATIONAL POLICE LTG JAFFARQOLI SADRI ASSURED EMBOFF AUG. 17 THAT CURRENT FLURRY OF INCIDENTS CONSTITUTES DYING GASP OF GUERRILLAS WHO, HE CLAIMS, HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY TWO THIRDS IN PAST YEAR AND ARE FORCED TO ACT NOW TO SHOW THEY STILL EXIST. IN A MEDIA INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN LOCAL PRESS AUG. 19, SADRI UPPED FIGURE FOR REDUCTION OF GUERRILLA FORCES TO THREE FOURTHS, PREDICTED THAT REMAINING TERRORISTS WOULD SOON BE WIPED OUT AND REITERATED STANDARD GOVERNMENT LINE THAT GUERRILLAS ARE CONFUSED MISGUIDED INDIVIDUALS OF MARXIST-LENINIST BENT BUT WITHOUT GOALS OR PROGRAM. IN DISCUSSION WITH EMBOFF SADRI ATTACHED NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO MURDER OF GENERAL TAHERI, ASSERTING THAT TERRORISTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISIFED WITH ANY HIGH-RANKING OFFICER AND CHOSE TAWERI ONLY BECUASE OF IOSLATED LOCATION OF HIS HOUSE AND HIS PREFERENCE FOR LONG WALKS ALONE. SADRI ALSO DISCOUNTED POSSIBILITY THAT ASSASSINS WERE OF HIGHER CALIBER THAN RUN-OF-THE-MILL GUERRILLAS, POINTING OUT THAT SHOTS WHICH KILLED TAHERI HAD BEEN FIRED FROM 50 CENTIMETERS AND THAT \"A CHILD COULD HIT A MAN FROM THAT DISTANCE.\" 
 
COMMENT: WE CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAT TAHERI WAS PERSONALLY TARGETED DUE TO HIS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN ANTI-GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER, SKILLFUL MANNER IN WHICH ASSASSINATION CARRIED OUT, REQUIRING CAREFUL PLANNING AND RECONNAISSANCE AS WELL AS DEFT EXECUTION, APPEARS TO INDICATE THAT THOSE INVOLVED WERE MUCH BETTER TRAINED THAN AVERAGE TERRORISTS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN BLOWN UP BY THEIR OWN BOMBS. 
 
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NUMBER OF GUERRILLA INCIDENTS WILL BEGIN TO TAPER OFF, BUT WE DO NOT SHARE SADRI\'S CONFIDENCE THAT HIS TACTICS AND THOSE OF SAVAK CAN COMPLETELY HALT TERRORIST ACTIVITY. IN FACT OVER REACTION AND TOO ZEALOUS A REPRESSION BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS SEEM AT LEAST AS LIKELY TO RECRUIT NEW GUERRILLAS AS TO STAMP OUT OLD ONES. IN ADDITION WISDOM SEEMS QUESTIONABLE OF SECURITY OFFICIALS MAKING PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS ABOUT BREAKUP OF GUERRILLA GROUPS AND PREDICTIONS OF THEIR DEMISE. WE RECALL THAT THE LAST SUCH ANNOUNCEMENT LAST JANUARY WAS FOLLOWED BY SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS ON US-PROPERTIES AND OTHER SITES IN TEHRAN. IN OUR VIEW SUCH PUBLIC DECLARATIONS RUN RISK OF INCREASING CREDIBILITY GAP AND RESENTMENT ON PART OF PUBLIC WHO LIKELY BE INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE OF INDISCRIMINATE ARRESTS THAT DO NOT SEEM TO BE STAMPING OUT TERRORISTS. 
 
THE PROGNOSTICATION THEREFORE IS FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE TERRORISM BUT, DESPITE SUCCESSFUL MURDER OF TAHERI, WE DO NOT CONCLUDE THAT GUERRILLAS WILL NOW PLACE GREATER RELIANCE ON ASSASSINATION AS A TOOL. REASON IS THAT TERRORISTS STILL LACK ENOUGH TRAINED PERSONNEL TO PULL OFF ASSASSINATIONS ON REGULAR BASIS.

WILL BE GOOD OCCASION TO PASS ON ANY THOUGHTS WE 
HAVE REGARDING PAKISTAN AS BHUTTO ARRIVING TEHRAN 
APRIL 7 AND TO REASSURE SHAH TOTAL ERA OF NEGOTIATION 
WITH MOSCOW DOES NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLY LESSENING OF 
TIES WITH IRAN. END SUMMARY. ACTION REQUESTED: 
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE BY OPEN OF BUSINESS APRIL 4 
SUMMARY OF OUR ECONOMIC AID TO PAKISTAN IN LAST 18 
MONTHS, HIGHLIGHTS OF RECENTLY REVISED ANNOUNCED ARMS 
POLICY TO PAKISTAN AND ANY OTHER POINTS DEPT OR ISLAMABAD 
THINK USEFUL TO PASS TO SHAH REGARDING BHUTTO VISIT. 
 
1. ON MORNING APRIL 5 I WILL BE PRESENTING MY CREDENTIALS 
TO SHAH. THIS OCCASION TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER 
AUDIENCES BEING SCHEDULED FOR APRIL DURING VISITS OF 
DEPSEC RUSH AND GENERALS GOODPASTER AND RYAN WILL 
PROVIDE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO SHAH MESSAGES OR 
THOUGHTS WE MAY HAVE ON: ( A) US/ IRANIAN RELATIONS, 
( B) DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND, ( C) ROLE 
IRAN CAN PLAY IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO OUR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE. 
 
2. AT PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS CEREMONY SHAH\' S CUSTOM 
IS TO TAKE AMBASSADOR ASIDE AFTER CEREMONIALS FOR PRIVATE 
CONVERSATION. THIS BEING MY FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING 
WITH SHAH AS AMBASSADOR, MY INTENTION IS TO LISTEN TO 
WHAT SHAH HAS TO SAY. I ANTICIPATE SHAH, AS IS HIS CUSTOM, 
WILL TAKE ME ON ONE OF HIS \" TOUR D\' HORIZONS\". WITH 
BHUTTO EXPECTED IN TOWN APRIL 7, PAKISTAN WILL UNDOUBTEDLY 
COME UP. SHAH WILL PROBABLY CHIDE US FOR NOT HELPING 
BHUTTO ADEQUATELY. IF SO, I PLAN REMIND SHAH OF ALL WE 
HAVE DONE ECONOMICALLY FOR PAKISTAN IN LAST YEAR OR SO 
AND OF RECENT DECISION TO LIFT ARMS EMBARGO ON NILITARY 
ITEMS FROZEN IN PIPELINE SINCE 1971. TO THIS END WOULD 
APPRECIATE HAVING BY MORNING APRIL 4 LOCAL TIME BREAKDOWN 
OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN FOR LAST 18 MONTHS AND 
MAIN POINTS OF OUR PRESENT ARMS POLICY TOWARDS PAKISTAN 
AND INDIA. 
 
3. IN ADDITION GIVEN SHAH\' S CLOSE RELATIONS WITH 
BHUTTO AND INFLUENCE ON PAK PRESIDENT, ARE TTHERE ANY 
POINTS REGARDING PAKISTAN WHICH DEPT OR ISLAMABAD THINK 
I COULD USEFULLY PUT TO SHAH FOR HIS TALKS WITH BHUTTO. 
 
4. WE HAVE ALSO NOTED ZAHEDI\' S DESCRIPTION OF SHAH\' S 
CONCERNS, WE BELIEVE THIS TO REFLECT SHAH\' S WORRY OVER 
TREND OF EVENTS IN THIS AREA WHICH HE CONSIDERS HOSTILE 
TO IRANIAN INTERESTS AND HIS NEED FOR PERIODIC REASSURANCE 
THAT HE IS NOT ISOLATED, THAT HE CAN COUNT ON 
CONTINUED US INTEREST IN IRAN AND THAT ANY DETENTE 
ACHIEVED BETWEEN US AND USSR WILL NOT WORK TO IRAN\' S 
DISADVANTAGE. 
 
5. IF SUBJECT COMES UP I PROPOSE MAKE SAME POINTS AS 
DEPSEC RUSH MADE TO ZAHEDI AND ASSURE HIM THAT WE 
HAVE NOT AND WOULD NOT DISCUSS IRAN/ US RELATIONS WITH 
USSR WITHOUT IRAN\' S FULL KNOWLEDGE. 
 
6. FINALLY, AT APPROPRIATE TIME I SHALL MENTION 
PRESIDENT\' S DEEP INTEREST IN HAVING SHAH AND EMPRESS 
PAY OFFICIAL VISIT TO WASHINGTON DURING 1973.

SUBJECT: SHAH ON CORRUPTION 
 
1. AFTER AMBASSADOR BYROADE\'S AUDIENCE WITH SHAH WAS 
FINISHED, I ASKED TO STAY BEHIND TO DISCUSS WITH SHAH 
APPROACH OF SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO SWEDISH AMBASSADOR AND 
OTHERS ABOUT ALLEGED INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OPPOSITION TO 
GOI AS RESULT SHAH\'S RECENT DECREES ON CORRUPTION AND ON 
NEW REQUIREMENT THAT GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND IMMEDIATE 
SUBORDINATES DIVEST THEMSELVES OF ANY SHARES THEY HOLD IN 
ANY COMPANIES OR INDUSTRIES. SHAH WAS OBVIOUSLY STARTLED 
TO LEARN THAT SOVIETS WERE CLAIMING TO NOTE INCREASED 
OPPOSITION AND ASKED RHETORICALLY HOW ANYONE COULD IMAGINE 
SUCH A THING. WE AGREED THAT THIS WAS SOVIET PSYCHOLOGICAL 
WARFARE DESIGNED TO UNSETTLE THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
THE SHAH IMMEDIATELY TIED IT IN TO THE RECENT 
TUDEH PARTY/IRAQI COMMUNIST PROCLAMATION CRITICIZING GOI 
ACTIVITIES. SHAH IS CONVINCED THAT SOVIETS ARE ATTEMPTING 
TO RECREATE TUDEH PARTY AND PUT MONEY INTO STRENGTHENING 
OF IRANIAN COMMUNIST MOVEMENT. 
 
2. BEING PENSIVE FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT WE HAD BEEN 
DISCUSSING, THE SHAH SAID, \"PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN TOO TOUGH 
ON CORRUPTION.\" TO WHICH I IMMEDIATELY REPLIED, \"NO, SIR, 
YOU CANNOT BE TOO TOUGH ON CORRUPTION.\" THERE THEN ENSUED 
A DISCUSSION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN IRAN IN THE YEARS AHEAD 
IF CORRUPTION IS NOT STEMMED WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
FLOATING AROUND IN THE ECONOMY. IT WAS QUITE CLEAR FROM 
THIS DISCUSSION THAT THE SHAH INDEED IS CONVINCED THAT HIS 
PROGRAM AND THE COUNTRY\'S FUTURE WILL GO RIGHT DOWNHILL 
IF HE IS NOT ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CORRUPTION ISSUE. 
 
3. WHEN THE SHAH MENTIONED HIS INSISTENCE THAT CERTAIN 
HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DIVEST THEMSELVES OF STOCKS 
AND HOLDINGS, I SAID, \"WON\'T MANY OF THEM HAVE TO UNLOAD?\" 
THE SHAH REPLIED, \"A FEW, NOT ALL.\"

Systematic Review 05 JUL 2006 
 
E.O. 11652: GDS 
TAGS: PINT, IR 
SUBJECT: IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY CREATED BY SHAH 
 
SUMMARY: CREATION OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY ANNOUNCED BY SHAH 
MARCH 2 IS MOVE TO SEEK BROADER SUPPORT FOR MONARCHY AND THE SHAHPEOPLE 
REVOLUTION. ALL IRANIANS OF VOTING AGE ARE EXPECTED TO 
EXPRESS ALLEGIANCE TO NEW PARTY OR RISK BEING VIEWED AS OPPONENTS 
OF SHAH AND EVEN TRAITORS WHO SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON. 
SHAH EXPLAINED IRAN\'S RETURN TO SINGLE PARTY SYSTEM AS NECESSARY 
BECAUSE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES UNQTE BY SOME IRANIANS SHOWED NEED 
FOR IRANIANS TO CLOSE RANKS IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE QTE GREAT 
CIVILIZATION, UNQTE AND BECAUSE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD FAILED. 
ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR SUMMER WILL APPARENTLY BE HELD, BUT IT IS 
NOT CLEAR HOW THEY WILL BE ORGANIZED. NET RESULT IS TO MAKE 
IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM LESS FLEXIBLE. INTERNATIONAL REACTION 
WILL PROBABLY RANGE FROM INDIFFERENCE TO CHARGES OF INCREASED 
TOTALITARIANISM. SHAH APPARENTLY PLANS TO CONTINUE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT 
IN DAILY POLITICAL AFFAIRS. THIS IS CONTRARY TO EARLIER SUGGESTIONS 
THAT HE MIGHT BE MOVING GRADUALLY TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO 
BROAD POLICY GUIDANCE AND LEAVE IMPLEMENTATION TO GOVERNMENT. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
1. SHAH\'S LENGTHY STATEMENT AT HIS MARCH 2 PRESS CONFERENCE, FROM 
WITH CORRESPONDENTS FOR FOREIGN MEDIA WERE EXCLUDED, (TEXT SENT BY 
AIRGRAM) ESTABLISHED IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. NEW PARTY WILL 
ABSORB RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY, LOYAL OPPOSITION MARDOM PARTY, 
AND THE ULTRA-NATIONALIST PAN IRANIST PARTY AND ITS SPLINTER 
GROUP THE IRANIANS PARTY. PRIME MINISTER HOVEYDA IS TO BE SECRETARY 
GENERAL FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWO YEARS. SHAH WILL LATER 
PROPOSE CHAIRMAN OF NEW PARTY\'S EXECUTIVE BOARD AND PRESIDENT FOR 
ITS POLITICAL BUREAU. A PARTY CONGRESS WILL BE HELD, PERHAPS 
WITHIN TWO MONTHS. GENERAL ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD THIS SUMMER 
UNDER AUSPICES OF NEW PARTY. 
 
2. SHAH\'S STATEMENT BEGAN WITH FAMILIAR RECITATION OF IRAN\'S 
GROWING SELF-RELIANCE AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE CONTRASTING SHARPLY 
WITH ITS RELATIVE WEAKNESS IN FIRST HALF OF CENTURY. HE NOTED THAT 
OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE CREATED IN RESPONSE TO HIS OWN WISHES 
AND COMMENTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN FACED WITH A DIFFICULT TASK. 
SHAH OBSERVED THAT THEY HAD FAILED TO FULFILL THEIR PROPER ROLE. HE 
COMMENTED THAT SOME IRANIANS HAD MADE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES 
UNQTE WHICH REFLECTED A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN\' GOALS. IN 
ORDER TO WELD ALL IRANIANS TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF GOALS OF THE 
SHAH-PEOPLE REVOLUTION, HE HAD, THEREFORE, DECIDED TO CREATE NEW 
ORGANIZATION WHICH WOULD SUPPRESS PARTY DIFFERENCES. ONLY REQUIREMENTS 
FOR MEMBERSHIP IN NEW ORGANIZATION WOULD BE LOYALTY TO (1) 
MONARCHY, (2) IRAN\'S CONSTITUTION, AND (3) SIXTH OF BAHMAN (SHAHPEOPLE) 
REVOLUTION. HE SPECIFICALLY SAID NEW PARTY WOULD FOSTER 
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, AND HE PREDICTED THAT POLITICAL WINGS 
WOULD EVOLVE WITHIN NEW PARTY. HE URGED ALL IRANIANS ELIGIBLE TO 
VOTE TO ENTER INTO NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURE OR CLARIFY THEIR POSITION. 
BY THIS HE MEANT THAT THOSE WHO COULD NOT AGREE WITH THE 
THREE PRINCIPLES SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON AS TRAITORS 
UNLESS THEY OPENLY EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL AND WERE NOT ANTINATIONAL. 
IF DISAPPROVAL IS IDEOLOGICAL, PERSON WOULD REMAIN FREE 
IN IRAN BUT QTE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS UNQTE. FULL 
PARTICIPATION IN IRAN\'S PROGRESS WOULD OBVIOUSLY REQUIRE MEMBERSHIP 
IN THE IRAN RESURGENCE PARTY. HE SAID IT WAS HIS EXPECTATION 
THAT WORKERS, FARMERS, AND TEACHERS WOULD BE THE FIRST GROUPS TO 
ANNOUNCE THEIR LOYALTY TO THE NEW PARTY. 
 
3. COMMENT: ABOVE ALL, SHAH\'S ACTION IN RETURNING TO SINGLE PARTY 
SYSTEM OF 1964-67 PERIOD SHOWS HIS EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO CRITICISM 
AND STRONG DESIRE TO RECEIVE OVERT EVIDENCE OF POPULAR SUPPORT. 
AFTER HE EXPERIMENTED WITH TAME OPPOSITION PARTIES IN 
1956-64 PERIOD WITH POOR RESULTS, SHAH THEN TURNED TO HASSAN ALI 
MANSUR\'S PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY TO CREATE IRAN NOVIN PARTY AS INSTRUMENT 
TO IMPLEMENT HIS SIXTH OF BAHMAN REVOLUTION. MARDOM PARTY 
WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REJUVENATED TO STIMULATE IRAN NOVIN TO PERFORM 
MORE EFFECTIVELY. DESPITE CONSTANT STATEMENTS OF LOYALTY TO SHAH 
AND HIS PLANS FOR IRAN, PARTIES HAVE APPARENTLY NOT PLEASED HIM. 
AS INDICATED BY FAILURES OF FORMER MARDOM PARTY SECRETARIES 
GENERAL ALI NAQI AND NASSER AMERI, EVEN ACTIVITIES OF GELDED 
OPPOSITION HAD PROVED TOO CRITICAL FOR SHAH\'S TASTE. NEVERTHELESS 
HIS PAST STATEMENTS INDICATED CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR COCCEPT OF 
MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM IN IRAN, AND IMPERIAL DECISION TO INSTITUTE ONEPARTY 
STATE REPRESENTS 180-DEGREE SHIFT IN POLICY WHICH ALSO 
APPEARS TO NEGATE EARLIER PROMISES OF FREER ELECTIONS LATER THIS 
YEAR. KEY SECTION OF SPEECH IS COMMENT THAT HE HAD HEARD QTE SOME 
REALLY SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES, WHICH IN NOW WAY SHOULD BE EXPECTED 
FROM AN IRANIAN. THIS SCENE, OF COURSE, HAS ALWAYS RECURRED WHEN 
IRAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE DEFENCE OF ITS RIGHTS AT A HISTORIC 
JUNCTURE. THIS SITUATION IS INTOLERABLE, UNQTE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WE DOUBT THAT MUCH CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WILL EMERGE 
FROM THE IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. 
 
4. IN OPERATIONAL TERMS LITTLE HAS CHANGED, FOR DESPITE FACADE OF 
QTE ME-TOO UNQTE OPPOSITION PARTIES SHAH HAS ALWAYS CALLED THE 
TUNE AND ONLY RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY HAD ANY IMPORTANCE. PRIME 
MINISTER HAS BEEN LEAD DANCER, AND HIS SELECTION AS SECGEN AT 
JANUARY PARTY CONGRESS HAD TIED IRAN NOVIN PARTY EVEN CLOSER TO 
SHAH. IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF NEW MOVE HAS BEEN FLOOD OF STATEMENTS 
OF LOYALTY TO SHAH, CONSTITUTION AND REVOLUTION, BOTH BY 
GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS. THERE IS CLEARLY NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR 
IRANIANS WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN IRAN\'S DEVELOPMENT 
AND SHARE ITS PROSPERITY. ALL DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT 
SHAH\'S PLAN FOR IRAN WILL BE SUPPRESSED UNTIL NEW PARTY 
DEVELOPS AN IDEOLOGY AND ITS LEADERSHIP IS CONSTITUTED. 
 
5. SHAH\'S SPEECH IS VAGUE ON GOALS OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY AND 
MANY OTHER POINTS. IT IS NOT CLEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW CANDIDATES 
WILL BE SELECTED FOR SUMMER ELECTIONS AND ON WHAT PLATFORMS THEY 
WILL RUN. SPEECH SHOWS SIGNS OF HURRIED PREPARATION FOR ISSUANCE 
PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FOR ALGIERS. WHILE MOST IRANIANS WILL 
ACCEPT NEW CHANGE WITH TYPICAL CYNICISM, IMPLIED CRITICISM OF ALL 
PARTIES FOR FAILING TO GET BEHIND SHAH\'S PUSH FOR REVOLUTION FROM 
THE TOP MAY ALIENATE SOME PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE 
WORKED HARD FOR IRAN NOVIN PARTY ON ASSUMPTION THEY WERE CARRYING 
OUT SHAH\'S WISHES. 
 
6. INTERNATIONAL REACTION WILL PROBABLY VARY FROM INDIFFERENCE TO 
INCREASINGLY SHRILL CHARGES OF TOTALITARIANISM. IRAN\'S IMAGE AS 
COUNTRY IN WHICH ALL ELEMENTS WERE BEING TAPPED IN DEVELOPMENT 
PROCESS MAY SUFFER UNLESS NEW PARTY\'S MEMBERSHIP COMES FROM BROAD 
SPECTRUM. IT APPEARS THAT EARLIER SUCCESSFUL IRANIAN POLICY OF 
COMPROMISE AND COOPERATION HAS BEEN REPLACED BY QTE TAKE IT OR 
LEAVE IT UNQTE STANCE IN DEALING WITH OPPOSITION. 
 
7. IN A-19 EMBASSY NOTED THAT SHAH HOPES TO MOVE TOWARD SITUATION 
IN WHICH HE GIVES POLICY GUIDANCE BUT KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM 
DAILY ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT. INITAL IMPRESSION OF HIS ACTION IN 
CREATING NEW POLITICAL PARTY AND FORECASTING HIS PERSONAL SELECTION 
OF SOME OF ITS LEADERS IS THAT HE HAS RETURNED TO MORE DIRECT 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT. BETTER JUDGMENT ON THIS 
POINT CAN BE MADE WHEN FUNCTION OF NEW PARTY BECOME CLEAR. 
 
8. IN SUM, GIVEN EXISTING STRICT DEGREE OF POLITICAL CONTROLS, 
SHAH\'S DECISION TO MELD ALL POLITICAL PARTIES INTO ONE APPEARS TO 
OFFER LITTLE IN WAY OF IMPROVEMENTS TO IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM 
WHILE ADDING SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.

SUBJ: SERIOUS RELIGIOUS DISSIDENCE IN QOM 
 
1. IN MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT OF THIS SORT FOR YEARS, 5 
DEMONSTRATORS WERE SHOT DEAD AND 9 INJURED WHEN POLICE 
OPENED FIRE ON A CROWD ATTEMPTING TO OCCUPY A POLICE 
STATION IN THE HIGHLY RELIGIOUS CITY OF QOM JAN 9. A 
POLICE OFFICE AND 3 POLICEMEN WERE INJURED BY THE 
DEMONSTRATORS AND ONE 13 YEAR BOY WAS TRAMPLED TO DEATH 
IN THE STAMPEDE THAT FOLLOWED THE SHOOTING. 
 
2. INCIDENT OCCURRED ON ANNIVERSARY OF LAND REFORM 
LEGISLATION PASSED IN 1963. IT FOLLOWED A MUCH MILDER 
PROTEST BY STUDENTS OF RELIGION SHOUTING ANTI-NATIONAL 
SLOGANS ON JAN 7 THE 42ND ANNIVERSARY OF REZA SHAH\'S 
DECREE ABOLISHING THE VEIL FOR WOMEN. 
 
3. ON THE 9TH A MOB OF PROTESTORS ARMED WITH STONES, 
IRON BARS, AND WOODEN STAVES REPORTEDLY RAMPAGED THROUGH 
THE STREETS SMASHING WINDOWS OF SHOPS AND DESTROYING 
PREMISES OF REASTAKHIZ PARTY HEADQUARTERS. THEY THEN 
TRIED TO TAKE OVER A POLICE STATION, DAMAGING POLICE 
VEHICLES OUTSIDE. POLICE WARNINGS AND WARNING SHOTS INTO 
THE AIR WENT UNHEEDED, AND POLICE THEN FIRED INTO THE 
CROWD. 
 
4. INFORMATION ON THIS INCIDENT WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS 
BY PARS NEW AGENCY AFTERNOON JAN 10. SAME INFORMATION WAS 
GIVEN TO DCM BY COURT MINISTER HOVEYDA AT SHAH\'S DINNER 
THAT EVENING FOR VISITING CODE. 
 
5. COMMENT: DEMONSTRATIONS ARE BEING ASCRIBED BY POLICE 
AUTHORITIES -- ACCURATELY WE BELIEVE -- TO CONSERVATIVE 
RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION ELEMENTS (THOUGH NOT SPECIFICALLY TO 
FOLLOWERS OF KHOMEINI OR TO ISLAMIC MARXISTS AS SUCH). 
THIS IS FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS, IN OUR RECOLLECTION, 
THAT POLICE HAVE KILLED SEVERAL DEMONSTRATORS BY FIRING 
INTO A CROWD. SEVERITY OF THIS INCIDENT WOULD APPEAR TO 
ARGUE AGAINST THOSE AMONG THE JOURNALISTS AND OTHER 
OBSERVERS HERE WHO HAVE SUSPECTED MANY RECENT INCIDENTS 
WERE COOKED UP BY IRANIAN SECURITY FORCES TO IMPRESS THE 
SHAH AND/OR USG. BY THE SAME TOKEN, IT IS POSSIBLE TO 
CONCLUDE THAT RELATIVE POLICE LENIENCY, AS FOR EXAMPLE IN 
LACK OF EFFECTIVE REACTION TO STUDENT DEMONSTRATION JAN 7, 
ENCOURAGED MORE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION WHICH NECESSITATED 
VIOLENT REPRESSION TO PUT DOWN. AT LEAST IT IS CONCEIVABLE 
THAT THE MANY PROPONENTS OF THE MAILED FIST IN GOI 
ESTABLISHMENT MIGHT SO ARGUE TO THE SHAH AND PRIMIN 
AMOUZEGAR IN EFFORT TO REVERSE RELATIVE LIBERALIZATION OF 
RECENT MONTHS.

SUBJECT: NEGOTIATIONS 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. INTRODUCTION: RECENT NEGOTIATIONS IN WHICH THE 
EMBASSY HAS BEEN INVOLVED HERE, RANGING FROM COMPOUND 
SECURITY TO VISA OPERATIONS TO GTE TO THE SHERRY CASE, 
HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES OF CONDUCTING 
BUSINESS IN THE PERSIAN ENVIRONMENT. IN SOME INSTANCES 
THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED ARE A PARTIAL 
REFLECTION ON THE EFFECTS OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION, 
BUT WE BELIEVE THE UNDERLYING CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
QUALITIES THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE NATURE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES 
ARE AND WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSTANT. THEREFORE, 
WE SUGGEST THAT THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS BE USED TO BRIEF 
BOTH USG PERSONNEL AND PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES 
WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUSINESS WITH AND IN THIS 
COUNTRY. END INTRODUCTION. 
 
3. PERHAPS THE SINGLE DOMINANT ASPECT OF THE PERSIAN 
PSYCHE IS AN OVERRIDING EGOISM. ITS ANTECEDENTS LIE 
IN THE LONG IRANIAN HISTORY OF INSTABILITY AND INSECURITY 
WHICH PUT A PREMIUM ON SELF-PRESERVATION. THE PRACTICAL 
EFFECT OF IT IS AN ALMOST TOTAL PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION 
WITH SELF AND LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR UNDERSTANDING POINTS 
OF VIEW OTHER THAN ONE\'S OWN. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IT 
IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO AN IRANIAN THAT U.S. IMMIGRATION 
LAW MAY PROHIBIT ISSUING HIM A TOURIST VISA WHEN HE HAS 
DETERMINED THAT HE WANTS TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. 
SIMILARLY, THE IRANIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES NO INCONSISTENCY 
IN CLAIMING FORCE MAJEURE TO AVOID PENALTIES FOR LATE 
PAYMENT OF INTEREST DUE ON OUTSTANDING LOANS WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT OF WHICH IT IS A PART IS DENYING THE VAILIDITY 
OF THE VERY GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS MADE WHEN 
CONFRONTED BY SIMILAR CLAIMS FROM FOREIGN FIRMS FORCED 
TO CEASE OPERATIONS DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION. 
 
4. THE REVERSE OF THIS PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL COIN, 
AND HAVING THE SAME HISTORICAL ROOTS AS PERSIAN EGOISM, 
IS A PERVASIVE UNEASE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN 
WHICH ONE LIVES. THE PERSIAN EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT 
NOTHING IS PERMANENT AND IT IS COMMONLY PERCEIVED THAT 
HOSTILE FORCES ABOUND. IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT EACH 
INDIVIDUAL MUST BE CONSTANTLY ALERT FOR OPPORTUNITIES 
TO PROTECT HIMSELF AGAINST THE MALEVOLENT FORCES THAT 
WOULD OTHERWISE BE HIS UNDOING. HE IS OBVIOUSLY 
JUSTIFIED IN USING ALMOST ANY MEANS AVAILABLE TO EXPLOIT 
SUCH OPPORTUNITIES. THIS APPROACH UNDERLIES THE SOCALLED 
\"BAZAAR MENTALITY\" SO COMMON AMONG PERSIANS, A 
MIND-SET THAT OFTEN IGNORES LONGER TERM INTERESTS IN 
FAVOR OF IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE ADVANTAGES AND COUNTENANCES 
PRACTICES THAT ARE REGARDED AS UNETHICAL BY OTHER 
NORMS. AN EXAMPLE IS THE SEEMINGLY SHORTSIGHTED AND 
HARASSING TACTICS EMPLOYED BY THE PGOI IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH GTE. 
 
5. COUPLED WITH THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS IS A 
GENERAL INCOMPREHENSION OF CASUALITY. ISLAM, WITH ITS 
EMPHASIS ON THE OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD, APPEARS TO ACCOUNT 
AT LEAST IN MAJOR PART FOR THIS PHENOMENON. SOMEWHAT 
SURPRISINGLY, EVEN THOSE IRANIANS EDUCATED IN THE 
WESTERN STYLE AND PERHAPS WITH LONG EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE 
IRAN ITSELF FREQUENTLY HAVE DIFFICULTY GRASPING THE 
INTER-RELATIONSHIP OF EVENTS. WITNESS A YAZDI RESISTING 
THE IDEA THAT IRANIAN BEHAVIOR HAS CONSEQUENCES ON THE 
PERCEPTION OF IRAN IN THE U.S. OR THAT THIS PERCEPTION 
IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO AMERICAN POLICIES REGARDING 
IRAN. THIS SAME QUALITY ALSO HELPS EXPLAIN PERSIAN 
AVERSION TO ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE\'S OWN 
ACTIONS. THE DEUS EX MACHINA IS ALWAYS AT WORK. 
 
6. THE PERSIAN PROCLIVITY FOR ASSUMING THAT TO SAY 
SOMETHING IS TO DO IT FURTHER COMPLICATES MATTERS. 
AGAIN, YAZDI CAN EXPRESS SURPRISE WHEN INFORMED THAT THE 
IRREGULAR SECURITY FORCES ASSIGNED TO THE EMBASSY REMAIN 
IN PLACE. \"BUT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TOLD ME THEY 
WOULD GO BY MONDAY,\" HE SAYS. AN MFA OFFICIAL REPORTS 
THAT THE SHERRY CASE IS \"90 PERCENT SOLVED,\" BUT WHEN 
A CONSULAR OFFICER INVESTIGATES HE DISCOVERS THAT NOTHING 
HAS CHANGED. THERE IS NO RECOGNITION THAT INSTRUCTIONS 
MUST BE FOLLOWED UP, THAT COMMITMENTS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED 
BY ACTION AND RESULTS. 
 
6. FINALLY, THERE ARE THE PERSIAN CONCEPTS OF INFLUENCE 
AND OBLIGATION. EVERYONE PAYS OBEISANCE TO THE FORMER 
AND THE LATTER IS USUALLY HONORED IN THE BREACH. 
PERSIANS ARE CONSUMED WITH DEVELOPING PARTI BAZI--THE 
INFLUENCE THAT WILL HELP GET THINGS DONE--WHILE FAVORS 
ARE ONLY GRUDGINGLY BESTOWED AND THEN JUST TO THE 
EXTENT THAT A TANGIBLE QUID PRO QUO IS IMMEDIATELY 
PRECEPTIBLE. FORGET ABOUT ASSISTANCE PROFERRED LAST 
YEAR OR EVEN LAST WEEK; WHAT CAN BE OFFERED TODAY? 
 
7. THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSONS FOR THOSE WHO WOULD NEGOTIATE 
WITH PERSIANS IN ALL THIS: 
 
- --FIRST, ONE SHOULD NEVER ASSUME THAT HIS SIDE OF 
THE ISSUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED, LET ALONE THAT IT WILL 
BE CONCEDED TO HAVE MERITS. PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION WITH 
SELF PRECLUDES THIS. A NEGOTIATOR MUST FORCE RECOGNITION 
OF HIS POSITION UPON HIS PERSIAN OPPOSITE NUMBER. 
 
- --SECOND, ONE SHOULD NOT EXPECT AN IRANIAN READILY 
TO PERCEIVE THE ADVANTAGES OF A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP 
BASED ON TRUST. HE WILL ASSUME THAT HIS OPPOSITE 
NUMBER IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADVERSARY. IN DEALING WITH 
HIM HE WILL ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO HIMSELF 
THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE. HE WILL BE PREPARED 
TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, INCLUDING 
RUNNING THE RISK OF SO ALIENATING WHOEVER HE IS DEALING 
WITH THAT FUTURE BUSINESS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE, AT 
LEAST TO THE LATTER. 
 
- --THIRD, INTERLOCKING RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL ASPECTS 
OF AN ISSUE MUST BE PAINSTAKINGLY, FORECEFULLY AND 
REPEATEDLY DEVELOPED. LINKAGES WILL BE NEITHER READILY 
COMPREHENDED NOR ACCEPTED BY PERSIAN NEGOTIATORS. 
 
- --FOURTH, ONE SHOULD INSIST ON PERFORMANCE AS THE 
SINE QUA NON AT ESH STAGE OF NEGOTIATIONS. STATEMENTS 
OF INTENTION COUNT FOR ALMOST NOTHING. 
 
- --FIFTH, CULTIVATION OF GOODWILL FOR GOODWILL\'S SAKE 
IS A WASTE OF EFFORT. THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE AT ALL 
TIMES SHOULD BE IMPRESSING UPON THE PERSIAN ACROSS THE 
TABLE THE MUTUALITY OF THE PROPOSED UNDERTAKINGS, HE 
MUST BE MADE TO KNOW THAT A QUID PRO QUO IS INVOLVED 
ON BOTH SIDES. 
 
- --FINALLY, ONE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE THREAT 
OF BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND NOT 
BE COWED BY THE POSSIBLITY. GIVEN THE PERSIAN 
NEGOTIATOR\'S CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, HE 
IS GOING TO RESIST THE VERY CONCEPT OF A RATIONAL 
(FROM THE WESTERN POINT OF VIEW) NEGOTIATING PROCESS.

E.O. 12065: GES 9/17/95 (LIMBERT, JOHN) OR-P 
TAGS: PGOV, PINT, IR 
SUBJECT: PM BAZARGAN CRITICIZED 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS, PM MEHDI BAZARGAN 
HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF CRITICISMS FROM VARIOUS SIDES. HE HAS 
BEEN ACCUSED OF ANTI-CLERICALISM, OF INEFFECTIVENESS, AND OF 
GENERAL BUNGLING. BAZARGAN HAS ANSWERED THESE ATTACKS BY 
CLAIMING THAT THE SAME PERSONS WHO WERE CRITICIZING HIM ARE 
NOT ALLOWING HIS GOVERNMENT TO FUNCTION. DEPSITE THESE 
ATTACKS, IT APPEARS THAT BAZARGAN STILL ENJOYS THE SUPPORT 
OF KHOMEINI AND WILL NOT BE REPLACED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) THE FIRST ATTACK ON BAZARGAN CAME FROM AYATOLLAH DR. 
MOHAMMAD BEHESHTI, VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS, 
MEMBER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLICAN PARTY. IN AN 
INTERVIEW WITH PARS NEW AGENCY IN QOM ON SEPTEMBER 14, DR. 
BEHESHTI BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT AND PM BAZARGAN FOR FAILING 
TO IMPLEMENT A BILL ON THE FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. 
ACCORDING TO BEHESHTI, THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL TWO MONTHS 
BEFORE HAD APPROVED A BILL CALLING FOR THE FORMATION OF 
COUNCILS AT PROVINCE, CITY, DISTRICT, AND VILLAGE LEVELS. 
BEHESHTI SAID DR. BAZARGAN\'S GOVERNMENT FAILED TO IMPLEMENT 
THIS BILL, EITHER BECAUSE OF DELIBERATE PROCRASTINATION OR 
BECAUSE OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE WEAKNESS. (DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER BANI-ASSADI TOLD CHARGE SEPT 17 THAT BAZARGAN\'S 
OFFICE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING THE REVOLUTIONARY 
COUNCIL\'S BILL, HAD SENT A LETTER TO THE COUNCIL TELLING 
THEM THAT THE BILL AS DRAFTED WAS UNREALISTIC BUT THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK OUT A FEASIBLE BILL ALONG THOSE LINES. 
 
3. (C) LATER THE SAME DAY, THE MONOTHEISM PARY (HEZB-E- 
TOWHIDI) ISSUED A SEVEN-POINT STATEMENT CRITICIZING THE 
BAZARGAN GOVERNMENT FOR NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE. LITTLE IS 
KNOWN ABOUT THE HEZB-E-TOWHIDI EXCEPT THAT IT IS AN ISLAMIC 
POLITICAL GROUPING WITH POSSIBLE TIES TO AYATOLLAH SADEQ 
ROWHANI. THE CRITICISMS DIRECTED AT BAZARGAN INCLUDED: 
 
-  (A) GOVERNMENT INDIFFERENCE TO CRITICISMS OF IRAN IN THE 
FOREIGN PRESS, BOTH WESTERN AND NON-ALIGNED. 
 
-  (B) SEEKING POPULARITY BY PLAYING WITH WORDS AND BY 
OPPOSING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. \"PERHAPS YOU 
HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THE IRANIAN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT IS LED BY 
THE CLERGY.\" 
 
-  (C) DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL\'S BILL 
ON FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. 
 
-  (D) NEGLECTING TO FOLLOW AYATOLLAH ROWHANI\'S ADVICE ABOUT 
THE NECESSITY OF PURGING THE GOVERNMENT OF ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY 
ELEMENTS. 
 
4. (U) THESE ATTACKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY AN ATTACK ON 
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15 BY REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AND COUNCIL 
OF EXPERTS MEMBER ABU-AL-HASAN BANI-SADR. SPEAKING TO AN 
AUDIENCE IN YAZD, BANI-SADR ATTACKED BAZARGAN\'S ECONOMIC 
POLICIES AND ACCUSED HIM OF HINDERING THE WORK OF THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. BANI-SADR ALSO ACCUSED BAZARGAN OF: 
 
-  (A) REFUSING TO ACCEPT CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. 
 
-  (B) BUNGLING IN KURDESTAN AND THEN TRYING TO CLAIM CREDIT 
FOR GOVERNMENT ACTION THERE. 
 
-  (C) OPPOSING THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKS, A FAVORITE 
PROGRAM OF BANI-SADR. 
 
-  (D) BURYING HIMSELF IN TRIVIA AND NOT ORGANIZING HIS WORK 
PROGRAM. 
 
5. (U) IN AN ATTACK APPEARING IN THE ENGLISH AND PERSIAN- 
LANGUAGE PRESS OF SEPTEMBER 16, TEHRAN REVOLUTIONARY 
PROSECUTOR AYATOLLAH AHMAD AZARI-QOMI CRITICIZED BAZARGAN 
FOR ALLEGEDLY ANTI-CLERICAL STATEMENTS IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S 
EULOGY FOR AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY ON 
SEPTEMBER 11. AZARI-QOMI (WHO ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION FOR 
HEALTH REASONS) SAID THAT BAZARGAN HAD SAID THAT TALEGHANI, 
UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS, WAS NOT OPPOSED TO 
THE MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION. ACCUSING BAZARGAN 
 OF WEAKENING REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, AZARI-QOMI SAID, \"IT IS 
VERY STRANGE THAT A DISTINGUISHED FIGURE AS MR. BAZARGAN WOULD 
MAKE AN UNFAIR ACCUSATION AGAINST THE CLERGY. WAS IT NOT 
TALEGHANI\'S GOAL TO UNITE ALL GROUPS, THE FOREMOST OF WHICH 
WAS A COMMITTED AND ACTIVE CLERGY? HOW CAN HE (BAZARGAN) PRAISE 
TALEGHANI BY STIRRING UP THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE CLERGY AND BY 
CONDEMNING THIS PROGRESSIVE AND ACTIVE GROUP AS REACTIONARY?\" 
 
6. (C) LOCAL PRESS ACCOUNTS OF BAZARGAN\'S SPEECH DID NOT 
INCLUDE THE STATEMENTS WHICH OFFENDED AZARI-QOMI. EMBASSY WILL 
CHECK FULL TEXT OF SPEECH (WHEN AVAILABLE) TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY 
WHAT PRIME MINISTER SAID. 
 
7. ALTHOUGH THE PRESS HAS BEEN GIVING WIDE PUBLICITY TO THESE 
ATTACKS, BAZARGAN\'S REACTION HAS SO FAR BEEN LIMITED TO A 
STATEMENT AT AN ECONOMIC SEMINAR (REPORTED BY ETTELAAT OF 
SEPTEMBER 16) THAT THE SAME (UNNAMED PERSONS WHO WERE 
CRITICIZING HIS GOVERNMENT FOR ITS INEFFECTIVENESS WERE THE 
SAME ONES WHO WERE INTERFERING IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND 
PREVENTING HIS CABINET FROM OPERATING.) 
 
8. (C) THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME (NOR WILL IT BE THE LAST 
TIME) THAT BAZARGAN HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK FROM MEMBERS OF THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. 
ALTHOUGH THE ATTACKS COMING FROM VARIOUS DIRECTIONS AND FROM 
VARIOUS PERSONALITIES, ARE NOT NECESSARILY PART OF ANY CONCERTED 
ANTI-BAZARGAN CAMPAIGN, THERE ARE ENOUGH COMMON THEMESE IN THE 
CRITICISMS TO INDICATE THE COMMON INTERESTS OF HIS OPPONENTS. 
THESE THEMES INCLUDE: 
 
-  (A) IGNORING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. 
 
-  (B) IGNORING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. 
 
-  (C) GENERAL INEFFECTIVENESS AND BUNGLING. 
 
9. (C) IT IS WORTH NOTING, HOWEVER, THAT NONE OF THESE ATTACKS 
MENTION AYYATOLLAH KHOMEINI BY NAME AND THAT NONE OF THE 
ATTACKERS NOTE ANY CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR HIM. IN PREVIOUS 
DISAGREEMENTS OF THIS KIND, BAZARGAN HAS HAD ENOUGH SUPPORT 
FROM THE IMAM TO OVERCOME CALLS FOR HIS DISMISSAL. IT IS LIKELY 
THAT AS LONG AS BAZARGAN CONTINUES TO HAVE KHOMEINI\'S SUPPORT 
(AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF HIS LOSING IT) HE WILL BE ABLE TO 
SURVIVE SUCH ATTACKS. BAZARGAN\'S SURVIVAL, HOWEVER, IS UNLIKELY 
TO MAKE HIS GOVERNMENT ANY MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH THOSE 
WHO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OVER MOST OF HIS FUNCTIONS.

2. AT DINNER RECENTLY SOVIET AMBASSADOR VINOGRADOV SPOKE CANDIDLY OF PGOI. HE HAS SEEN VIRTUALLY ALL KEY LEADERS. AS AMIR-ENTEZAM OBSERVED, \"IF YOU CLOSE ONE DOOR, HE COMES IN THE OTHER WITH A PROPOSAL OR SOME DEAL.\" 
 
3. VINOGRADOV HAS SEEN KHOMEINI FOUR TIMES. HE DESCRIBED THE AYATOLLAH AS A MAN OF GREAT RECTITUDE, A TEACHER DISINCLINED TO LISTEN AND LITTLE VERSED IN POLITICAL REALITIES DOMESTICALLY OR INTERNATIONALLY.  TALAGHANI, THE AMBASSADOR SAID, WAS MUCH MORE THE REALIST. VINOGRADOV THOUGHT SKHESHTI WAS THE MOST INTELLIGENT AND POLITICALLY SKILLFUL OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP. BANI SADR MERITED ONLY SCORN. 
 
4. THE SOVIETS THINK THE PGOI\'S MOST DANGEROUS PROBLEM IS THE KURDISH REVOLT, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE STAGNATED ECONOMY. VINOGRADOV FEELS THE IRANIANS ARE TRYING TO MANAGE THE KURDS WITH FORCE AND THE ECONOMY WITH DREAMY ISLAMIC THEORIES.  NEITHER WILL WORK.  ALTHOUGH THE KURDISH PROBLEM MAY EVENTUALLY BE SETTLED, THERE WAS A REAL PROSPECT OF SHORTAGES, UNEMPLOYMENT AND OTHER SERIOUS ECONOMIC GRIEVANCES LEADING TO DISAFFECTION OF THE LOWER CLASSES FROM KHOMEINI.  IT HAS ALREADY STARTED, BUT THE PROCESS COULD CONTINUE FOR A COUPLE YEARS.  HE SUSPECTED THE IRAQIS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN CAUSING PROBLEMS WITH IRAN\'S KURDS AND ARABS, BUT DISMISSED THE THOUGHT THAT THESE USSR MIGHT HAVE INFLUENCE IN BAGHDAD TO RESTRAIN THE IRAQIS.  \"THEY ARE JUST CRAZY PEOPLE.\"

E.O. 12065: GDS 10/25/85 (TOMSETH, VICTOR L.) OR-P 
TAGS: PINT, SHUM, PINR, IR 
SUBJECT: MODERATION:  DOES IT HAVE A CHANCE? 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. SUMMARY:  THE MODERATE IRANIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH 
WERE ACTIVE DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND WHICH HAVE A 
LONG HISTORY OF OPPOSITION TO THE SHAH, HAVE BEEN PUSHED INTO 
THE BACKGROUND BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHO FOLLOW A 
NARROW AND AUTHORITARIAN INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM. WITHIN THE 
PAST FEW WEEKS, MODERATE GROUPS WHO FAVOR A MORE BALANCED 
SOCIETY RESEMBLING A WESTERN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY, HAVE BECOME 
MORE VOCAL. WHILE NOT DIRECTLY CRITICIZING AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI, 
THEY HAVE FOCUSED THEIR CRITICISM ON SOME OF THE OBVIOUS 
FAILURES OF THE PRESENT REGIME. THE POLITICAL POSITION OF 
THESE GROUPS IS STILL PRECARIOUS. IT EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH 
A FEW SECULAR SPOKESMEN, SOME LIBERAL CLERICS, AND SOME SMALL 
NEWSPAPERS. ALTHOUGH STILL NOT A MAJOR FORCE ON THE IRANIAN 
POLITICAL SCENE, THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ORGANIZE 
THEMSELVES ENOUGH TO EXPRESS IDEAS CONTRARY TO THOSE OF THE 
RULING ESTABLISHMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. THE ROLE OF SECULAR AND CLERICAL MODERATES -- THE HEIRS IS 
STILL A MATTER OF DEBATE. SINCE THE REVOLUTION FIGURES SUCH AS 
MATIN-DAFTARI NAZIH, FORUHAR, SANJABI, AND BAZARGAN HIMSELF 
HAVE BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY KHOMEINI AND BY HIS ALLIES WHO SHARE 
HIS VISION OF A THEOCRATIC IRAN. NOT ALL OF THESE SUPPORTERS 
OF KHOMEINI ARE CLERICS; THEY INCLUDE THE \"SECULAR MULLAHS\" 
SUCH AS QOTEZADEH, YAZDI, CHAMRAN, TABATABA\'I AND OTHERS. THIS 
GROUP HAS DOMINATED THE GOVERNMENT, THE PRESS, THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS. IT HAS 
HARRASSED AND IGNORED ITS OPPONENTS. BARZARGAN REMAINS 
POWERLESS; MATIN-DAFTARI AND NAZIH ARE IN HIDING; FORUHAR IS 
IGNORED; AND SAXJABI QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST AND LEFT THE 
COUNTRY. 
 
4. ALTHOUGH THE POSITION OF THE MODERATE PARTIES IS STILL VERY 
FRAGILE, IN RECENT WEEKS THEY HAS SHOWN SOME SIGNS OF LIFE. 
ALTHOUGH THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ORGANS, INCLUDING THE NEWSPAPER 
AYANDEGAN AND THE POPULAR HUMOR MAGAZINE AHANGAR, WERE 
SUPPRESSED IN AUGUST, THEY HAVE BEGUN PUBLISHING SMALL PAPERS 
SUCH AS KHALO-E-MOSALMAN (FROM THE MUSLIME REPUBLICAN PEOPLES\' 
PARTY); JONBESH (PUBLISHED BY ALI ASGHAR HAJ SEYYID JAVADI), 
JFBHEH-YE-AZADI FROM THE IRAN PARTY AND AZADI FROM THE 
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT. ALTHOUGH THE CIRCULATION OF THESE 
PAPERS IS LIMITED AND THEY CARRY MUCH LESS INFLUENCE THAN THE 
THREE MAJOR DAILIES (SAYHAN, ETTELAAT, AND BAMDAD) THEY DO 
OFFER SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON EVENT -- A 
COMMENTARY OFTEN AT VARIANCE WITH THE OFFICIAL VERSION. 
 
5. FOR THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THE MUSLIM REPUBLICAN PEOPLES PARTY 
(MPRP) HAS ORGANIZED FRIDAY AFTERNOON MEETINGS AT ITS TEHRAN 
HEADQUARTERS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRST MEETING ATTRACTED ONLY ABOUT 
100 PEOPLE, EMBASSY POLITICAL OFFICER AND POLITICAL ASSISTANT 
ATTENDED OCTOBER 19 MEETING AND FOUND AN OVERFLOW OF OVER 1500. 
THE CROWD WAS LARGELY MIDDLE-CLASS AND WELL-EDUCATED. THERE 
WERE MANY WOMEN, SOME VEILED, A FEW CLERICS. THE SPEAKERS 
INCLUDED AHMAD ALIZADRH, THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE MPRP, 
AND KAHMATULLAH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I, LEADER OF THE RADICAL 
MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF 
MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF 
EXPERTS. ALTHOUGH THE AUDIENCE AND SPEAKERS HAD NO AFFECTION 
FOR THE OLD REGIME, THERE WERE FEW MENTIONS OF AYATOLLAH 
KHOMEINI, AND NO ANTI-AMERICAN STATEMENTS. 
 
6. THE SPEAKERS ELICITED THE GREATEST RESPONSE BY THEIR 
ATTACKS ON AKHUNDBAZI (CLERICAL MEDDLING), ON THE COUNCIL OF 
EXPERTS, AND ON ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A THEOCRATIC 
DICTATORSHIP THROUGH THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIM. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS 
FOUND THE CROWD\'S PULSE WHEN HE SAID, \"WE WANT THE ISLAM OF DR. 
SHAR\'IATI; WE DON\'T WANT THE ISLAM OF ........)\" AND LEFT THE 
END EMPTY FOR THE CROWD TO FILL IN. BOTH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I 
AND ALIZADEH WERE CRITICAL OF THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH. THE LATTER 
SAID, \"THIS CLAUSE IS AN ACT OF TREASON AGAINST FUTURE 
GENERATIONS OF IRANIAN PEOPLE. WE HAD A REVOLUTION NOT TO 
PREPARE THE GROUND FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF DESPOTISM.\" sPEAKING 
PRIVATELY AFTER THE MEETING, MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I SAID THAT EVEN 
THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP HAS NOW REALIZED THAT IT WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO SELL THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH TO THE IRANIAN PEOPLE IN ITS 
PRESENT FORM. \"THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS HAS DECIDED TO REOPEN 
DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE. I HOPE THAT SOME KIND OF IMPROVEMENT WILL 
BE POSSIBLE.\" 
 
7. THE MODERATES, IN CRITICISING VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, HAVE FOUND 
SOME ALLIES AMONG CLERICS SUCH AS AYATOLLAHS NURI AND SHARI\'AT- 
MADARI WHO SHARE THE VIEW THAT SUCH AN INSTITUTION, IF NOT 
PROPERLY DEFINED, COULD LEAD TO A DICTATORSHIP. ONE OF THE MOST 
INTERESTING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAS BEEN THE ENTRANCE OF 
AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI\'S SON, HOJJAT AL-ISLAM AHMAD KHOMEINI, INTO 
THE DEBATE ON THIS SUBJECT. IN THESE DEBATES, THE YOUNG 
KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN A POSITION WHICH HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE 
MODERATE VIEW THAT VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, AS DEFINED BY THE 
CONSTITUTION, CONTAINS SOME DANGEROUS AMBIGUITIES. EMBASSY WILL 
DISCUSS THIS QUESTION IN MORE DETAIL IN SEPARATE MESSAGE. 
 
8. IN PART, RECENT OUTSPOKENNESS OF THE MODERATES CAN BE 
ATTRIBUTED TO DISILLUSION WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THE REVOLUTION -- 
ESPECIALLY TRENDS TOWARD AUTHORITARIAN, CLERICAL RULE. THE 
MODERATES HAVE ALSO TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S OBVIOUS 
MISHANDLING OF CERTAIN ISSUES TO ATTRACT ALLIES BEYOND THE 
NORMALLY MINISCULE CONTITUENCY OF GROUPS SUCH AS THE RADICAL 
MOVEMENT, THE IRAN PARTY, AND TEH NATIONAL FRONT. FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE OBVIOUS FAILURE OF A MILITARY POLICY IN KURDESTAN HAS 
BROUGHT CALLS FOR RECONCILIATION, EVEN BY FIGURES WITHIN THE 
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS. A COLUMNIST IN THE NORMALLY CONSERVATIVE 
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TEHRAN TIMES HAS URGED THE WITHDRAWAL OF NON- 
KURDISH GUARDS FROM THE REGION; THE TUDEH PARTY PAPER MARDOM, 
STUNG BY ACCUSATIONS OF SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN KURDESTAN, HAS 
CALLED FOR A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. ONLY THE RIGHT-WING ISLAMIC 
REPUBLICAN PARTY, THROUGH ITS ORGAN JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI, HAS 
CONTINUED TO REFER TO THE KURDISH INSURGENTS AS \"AMERICAN 
MERCENARIES\". HOWEVER, THE IRP HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ISOLATED 
IN ITS POSITION. 
 
9. THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO ENSURE PERSONAL SECURITY, ITS 
CRUDE ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP, AND SCANDALS INVOLVING THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COURT SYSTEM -- LARGE-SCALE BRIBERY AND THEFT 
INVOLVING NO LESS A FIGURE THAN FORMER TEHRAN PROSECUTOR 
AYATOLLAH AZARI-QOMI HIMSELF -- HAS ALSO WIDENED THE APPEAL OF 
THE MODERATE MESSAGE. THE PAPER AZADI OF OCTOBER 18 PRINTED A 
BITTER ATTACK ON THE REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE SYSTEM ACCUSING IT 
OF IGNORING THEFTS BY ILYAVI, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PROSECUTOR- 
GENERAL HADAVI, WHILE SENDING PROSTITUTES AND SMALL-TIME DRUG 
SMUGGLERS TO THE FIRING SQUAD. THE RECENT ATTACK ON TWO 
JOURNALISTS AT THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS BUILDING LED THE ULTRA- 
ESTABLISHMENT PAPER ETTELAAT OF OCTOBER 22 TO WRITE A STRONG 
FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL ENTITLED \"LET US NOT REPEAT MISTAKES\", 
POINTING OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF QOM AND TABRIZ REBELLED IN THE 
SHAH\'S TIME BECAUSE FOR DECADES THEY HAD BEEN DENIED THE RIGHT 
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. 
 
10. WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS ADD UP TO? MOST IMPORTANT, THE 
MODERATES OF THE IRAN PARTY, THE NATIONAL FRONT, AND OTHER 
GROUPS ARE ONCE AGAIN FINDING THEIR VOICE AND BEGINNING TO SPEAK 
OUT. IN DOING SO, THEY WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME SEVERAL MAJOR 
OBSTACLES: 
 
-   A) THE MEDIA REMAIN FOR THE MOST PART IN THE HANDS OF THEIR 
OPPONENTS. JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI BECOMES MORE RABID BY THE DAY, AND 
THE OTHER MAJOR PAPERS ARE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS. THE RADIO AND THE 
TELEVISION, UNDER QOTEZADEH\'S OPPORTUNISTIC AND UNENLIGHTENED 
GUIDANCE, RARELY DEVIATES FROM ITS DAILY MENU OF PSEUDO- 
RELIGIOUS DRIVEL INTERSPERSED WITH PSEUDO-REVOLUTIONARY DRIVEL. 
 
-   B) ALL INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN TAINTED BY KHOMEINI\'S 
DENUNCIATIONS. HIS FAMOUS AUGUST DECLARATION THAT \"WE DO NOT WANT 
INTELLECTUALS\" IS STILL REMEMBERED. HIS DIATRIBES AGAINST WESTERN 
DECADENCE HAVE MADE ALL WESTERN MANIFESTATIONS, INCLUDING 
NICETIES, SUSPECT IN HIS FOLLOWERS\' EYES. 
 
11. THESE MODERATE GROUPS STILL LEAD A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE ON 
THE FRINGES OF IRANIAN POLITICAL LIFE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY 
ARE LEFT ALONE TO HOLD THEIR MEETINGS AND PUBLISH THEIR 
NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED IRRELEVANT TO THE POLITICAL 
PROCESS. HOWEVER, IN HIS MOST RECENT SPEECHES, KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN 
NOTE OF THEM AND HAS CRITICIZED THEM HARSHLY FOR THEIR ATTACKS ON 
VELAYAT-E-FAQIH AND ON THE CLERGY. IN A SPEECH TO TEHRAN RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS ON OCTOBER 20, KHOMEINI REFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE MPRP 
MEETING, SAYING, \"RECENTLY, IN ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS, ONE OF THESE 
MISGUIDED ONES, WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ISLAM, SUGGESTED THAT THE 
COUNCIL OF EXPERTS SHOULD BE DISSOLVED. AND THE REST CHEERED... 
YOU, WHO DID NOT EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THE VOTING (FOR THE COUNCIL) 
HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY THIS... IT WAS THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO GAVE 
YOU (OPPONENTS OF VELAYATI-E-FAQIH) THE FREEDOM TO SAY WHATEVER 
YOU WANT TO SAY. YOU WERE IN HIDING WHEN THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
WERE STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SHAH AND HIS FATHER. NOW YOU WANT TO 
DISSOLVE THE ASSEMBLY?... YOU DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO. I 
WILL SLAP YOU IN THE MOUTH. STOP THIS AND JOIN THE RANKS OF ISLAM 
AND LET THIS COUNTRY PUT ITSELF IN ORDER.\" 
 
12. KHOMEINI\'S ATTACKS ON THIS GROUP ARE STILL ONLY WORDS AND ARE 
UNLIKELY TO TAKE THE FORM OF ALL-OUT REPRESSION INVOLVING THE 
CLOSING OF NEWSPAPERS, THE BANNING OF MEETINGS, AND THE ARREST OF 
LEADERSHIP. MANY OF THESE GROUPS AND THEIR LEADERS HAVE 
DISTINGUISHED RECORDS OF OPPOSITION TO THE MONARCHY - RECORDS WHICH 
ARE DIFFICULT TO IGNORE. HOWEVER, THE HARD-LINE CLERGY AND ITS 
ALLIES HAVE BEEN ISOLATING AND ATTACKING INDIVIDUAL TARGETS FROM 
AMONG THE MODERATES SUCH AS ??AZIH, METEN-DAFTARI, AND FORUHAR. 
 
13. AS THE AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO MISHANDLE MATTERS SUCH AS ARAB- 
IRANIAN RELATIONS, PROVINICIAL AFFAIRS, AND REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE, 
THE MESSAGE OF THESE MODERATE GROUPS COULD ATTRACT A WIDER 
FOLLOWING. PERHAPS THEY COULD FORCE SOME CONCESSION TO THOSE WHO 
DO NOT SHARE THE IMAM\'S VISION OF AN IRAN RULED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THE TEACHINGS OF THAT SPECIALIZED VIEW OF ISLAM HELD BY ONE SECTOR 
OF A MINORITY SECT OF THAT RELIGION. 
 
14. IN THE LONGER TERM, IF THESE GROUPS CAN PRESERVE SOME 
COHERENCE THEY MAY PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE TO A CLERICAL MONOPOLY 
OF POWER IN POST-KHOMEINI IRAN. AT THAT TIME THEIR REVOLUTIONARY 
CREDENTIALS MAY BECOME VERY IMPORTANT; BUT FOR THE IMMEDIATE 
FUTURE, THIS GROUP WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE ON THE PERIPHERY OF 
IRANIAN POLITICS -- ARTICULATE, INTERESTING, BUT WIELDING LITTLE 
REAL POWER.
